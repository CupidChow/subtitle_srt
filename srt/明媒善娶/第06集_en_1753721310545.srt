1
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,000
I'm afraid I can't return to the past.

2
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,000
Seeing the flowers in the branches,

3
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,000
the years are passing by.

4
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,000
I don't know why I'm missing you.

5
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,000
Some people want to repay their kindness,

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,000
but they have no power.

7
00:00:54,000 --> 00:01:00,000
A life with you is the best way.

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,000
The Long Ballad

9
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Episode 18

10
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,000
Today, no one can stop me.

11
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,000
I want to get the joy of the God of Wealth.

12
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
I'm afraid I can't return to the past.

13
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Seeing the flowers in the branches,

14
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:36,000
the years are passing by.

15
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,000
I don't know why I'm missing you.

16
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,000
Some people want to repay their kindness,

17
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
but they have no power.

18
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:54,000
A life with you is the best way.

19
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,000
The Long Ballad

20
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Tang Jie!

21
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,000
Tang Jie!

22
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,000
You...

23
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:23,000
What's wrong?

24
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Look at the mirror yourself.

25
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,000
How... How did I end up like this?

26
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
Tang Jie, you should go and light the candles.

27
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,000
Don't waste time in the bathroom.

28
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:43,000
How much did I drink yesterday?

29
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
Why can't I remember anything?

30
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,000
Forget it. Lighting the candles is important.

31
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,000
Hurry up.

32
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,000
Hurry up.

33
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,000
How's the construction going?

34
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I've sent someone to the Shen Family to check.

35
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
I didn't find it.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,000
Shen Chang participated in the construction of the imperial city.

37
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,000
And the secret passage was designed by him.

38
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,000
So the Shen Family will definitely keep the construction map.

39
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Only by getting this map,

40
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,000
can we work with the army outside the palace without wasting our energy.

41
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,000
But Shen Chang is good at designing mechanisms.

42
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:30,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

43
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,000
Shen Chang has a daughter named Shen Tongyun.

44
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
She's not married yet.

45
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,000
Guan Mei Ting!

46
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,000
I understand.

47
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,000
I'll order her to tell her daughter about her marriage.

48
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
You're smart this time.

49
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
I have the same idea.

50
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:52,000
You go and inform Deng Mei Guan.

51
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Tell her to find a son-in-law.

52
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:56,000
Shen Chang's daughter.

53
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,000
By then,

54
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,000
the water will be flooded and the moon will be full.

55
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

56
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,000
Yes.

57
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
I'll do it right now.

58
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:20,000
I don't know what you're here for.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
If you hadn't done something wrong,

60
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:24,000
and you couldn't even find a Qi Shao Heng,

61
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,000
how could I have been involved?

62
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
Right now,

63
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
the Tao clan's reputation has been ruined.

64
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
We can't go back to Guan Mei Ting to take over her position.

65
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,000
In the future, the marquis will be in charge of the imperial family.

66
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:36,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

67
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

68
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

69
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:42,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

70
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

71
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
I'm afraid we can't find the map.

72
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Do you know what to do

73
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,000
if the marquis has any instructions?

74
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:52,000
Yes, yes, yes. I understand.

75
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I understand.

76
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,000
The marquis asked you

77
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:58,000
to tell the only daughter of the marquis,

78
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Shen Chang,

79
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,000
about a good marriage.

80
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:04,000
Shen Tong Yun?

81
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,000
But,

82
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,000
everyone knows that

83
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:10,000
Shen Tong Yun has always been fond of beautiful men.

84
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,000
It's the parents' order.

85
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,000
It's not up to him to say it.

86
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:16,000
If you can't do it,

87
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:18,000
the marquis will change another person to do it.

88
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:20,000
I understand.

89
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
I'll send the geomotor

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,000
to the Shen Shi Lang of the Shen Mansion.

91
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,000
to the Shen Shi Lang of the Shen Mansion.

92
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:28,000
These

93
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,000
are placed on the shelves next to it.

94
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,000
Then, these goods

95
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:34,000
will be recorded today.

96
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Okay.

97
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
Do you think it's okay?

98
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
Almost.

99
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Master.

100
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,000
Master.

101
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
You look

102
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:50,000
good today.

103
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm in a good mood.

104
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,000
By the way, master,

105
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
there is a guest

106
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
who is not familiar with you.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
He sent a invitation

108
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:02,000
to say that he has been fond of you

109
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
and he is unwilling to leave no matter how he feels.

110
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,000
And, the lady said

111
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:08,000
she would come to Xibao Pavilion today.

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,000
Ake?

113
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,000
I'll talk about Ake later.

114
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,000
Please remember.

115
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,000
Ake.

116
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,000
You are finally a beauty.

117
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,000
No.

118
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,000
Xibao Pavilion.

119
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
What do you think?

120
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:30,000
You are right.

121
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,000
You are right.

122
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,000
Since you have agreed,

123
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
from today on,

124
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
the Guanmei Hall will not give you any more problems.

125
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
You can do some chores

126
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:42,000
and help your colleagues

127
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,000
to investigate the old party.

128
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:46,000
Why?

129
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
I didn't agree.

130
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,000
He didn't say that.

131
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,000
He was lying to you.

132
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
Lying to me?

133
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
Why did he lie to me?

134
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
Why else?

135
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
He was jealous of you.

136
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
He was jealous of you to be a beauty.

137
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:06,000
Jealous?

138
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,000
I have to do it too.

139
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,000
Zhao Mingguan, tell me.

140
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,000
What is Deng Yi doing recently?

141
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,000
I can handle it.

142
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,000
He is looking for a job

143
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
for the only daughter of the Minister of Works, Shen Tongyun.

144
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,000
Shen Tongyun?

145
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:24,000
The one who loves beauty?

146
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:26,000
All the beauties in the capital

147
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:28,000
have been proposed by him.

148
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,000
No one has agreed to him.

149
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:32,000
Why is Deng Yi looking for him?

150
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,000
If it was him,

151
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,000
Deng Yi would have no choice.

152
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
Who knows?

153
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Maybe he saw you

154
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
do the job of Qi Shaoheng's beauty.

155
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
He can convince Shen Tongyun.

156
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:48,000
Stop.

157
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,000
Guan Meiting Lawyer, Shen Fangke

158
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,000
wants to see you.

159
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,000
Guan Meiting.

160
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:04,000
Yes, Guan Meiting.

161
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,000
I am Shen Fangke.

162
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,000
Get in the car.

163
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,000
I have something more important to do.

164
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,000
Miss Shen, I...

165
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,000
Don't talk. Just listen to me.

166
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:18,000
I like a young man.

167
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:20,000
I just don't know him well.

168
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,000
I wanted to meet him in private, but I was always late.

169
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,000
So I want to choose a matchmaker to talk to him.

170
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,000
Since you are going to meet him, I will give you this chance.

171
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:30,000
I just want to marry him.

172
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,000
Just tell me the truth.

173
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,000
If you can, you are my wife.

174
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,000
Is it that simple?

175
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,000
Yes.

176
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,000
What do you like about this young man?

177
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,000
Why do you ask so many questions?

178
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I just want to ask you.

179
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
Do you accept this case or not?

180
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
I accept it.

181
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Miss, you can tell me the source of that man.

182
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:52,000
I will ask Miss.

183
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:54,000
You will know later.

184
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,000
Go.

185
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,000
Go.

186
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,000
Go.

187
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:12,000
Brother Lu.

188
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
Ke.

189
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,000
Come.

190
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,000
Go.

191
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Wait.

192
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
It's him.

193
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
What is him?

194
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:28,000
The young man I mentioned is him.

195
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,000
Lu Chi.

196
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
Wait.

197
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Who is Brother Lu looking at?

198
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Is it me or Shen Tong Niu?

199
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:50,000
Brother Lu.

200
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,000
Forget it.

201
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,000
Who is he looking at?

202
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
What does he have to do with me?

203
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
Ke.

204
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,000
Come in.

205
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:02,000
I was right.

206
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,000
You are old friends with Brother Lu.

207
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,000
You can be a couple with him.

208
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It's better to be a couple today.

209
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:10,000
I think today is the right time.

210
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,000
Brother Lu, I am Shen Tong Yun.

211
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
I think you have received the invitation I sent you.

212
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,000
The invitation?

213
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,000
Ke.

214
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,000
Is he your friend?

215
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,000
Kind of.

216
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Let me introduce.

217
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
This is Shen Tong Yun, Shen Xiao Niangzi.

218
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,000
The daughter of the Minister of Works.

219
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,000
Lu Chi.

220
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
The owner of Xibao Pavilion.

221
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,000
I have a good taste.

222
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,000
I didn't expect that Brother Lu is the owner of Xibao Pavilion.

223
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
Don't forget to give me a chance.

224
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,000
Don't forget to give me a chance.

225
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:50,000
Ke.

226
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,000
What do you want?

227
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:56,000
There are too many people here.

228
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:58,000
And it's not good to talk about this on the street.

229
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,000
Why don't you go back and wait for my good news?

230
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,000
I finally sent the invitation to see the real person.

231
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:04,000
I can't bear to leave like this.

232
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:08,000
Master.

233
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:10,000
Master.

234
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:14,000
Since Ke has a friend,

235
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,000
please come inside.

236
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:18,000
I have something to do.

237
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,000
Manager Lu, please wait a moment.

238
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
Yes.

239
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,000
Since Brother Lu has invited me, I will not be polite.

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:26,000
Please come with me.

241
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:28,000
Let's go.

242
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Let's go shopping with me.

243
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:32,000
What you like is mine.

244
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,000
Let's go.

245
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,000
I know this.

246
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:38,000
The brush stroke is the line.

247
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:40,000
Why does that person

248
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,000
like to draw the outline recently?

249
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,000
It's fine if it's troublesome.

250
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,000
But it's troublesome to find the door yourself.

251
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:48,000
Master.

252
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,000
I don't understand.

253
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:52,000
It's troublesome to play the zither.

254
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,000
Do you know this fake building?

255
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:58,000
This was built by the late emperor.

256
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:00,000
It is said that there is a secret passage

257
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,000
that can be used to enter the palace.

258
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:04,000
I have never heard of this secret passage.

259
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
What is the trouble?

260
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,000
This corner is built by

261
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,000
the head of the Shen family.

262
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,000
Master.

263
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:16,000
Come in.

264
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,000
Has the daughter of the Shen family left?

265
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,000
She is wandering around downstairs.

266
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,000
It doesn't look like she is leaving.

267
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:24,000
I know. I will go and have a look.

268
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,000
By the way, if the daughter of the Shen family

269
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:30,000
leaves the Xibao Pavilion,

270
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,000
I will go and have a look.

271
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,000
Yes.

272
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,000
Who is the master going to see?

273
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:40,000
Is it the daughter of the Shen family

274
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,000
or the daughter of the Shen family?

275
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,000
Don't ask me.

276
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I am confused too.

277
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,000
Miss, please look at this.

278
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:52,000
Miss, how about I try this one for you?

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:54,000
This one is also very beautiful.

280
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Forget it. I don't like this one.

281
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,000
Miss, please look at this.

282
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,000
Yes.

283
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,000
This way please.

284
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,000
She said there was a secret passage just now.

285
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
Now I am in a hurry to have a look.

286
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Brother Lu, do you need me to introduce again?

287
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:32,000
This Shen Tongyun, the daughter of the Shen family,

288
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
is very beautiful.

289
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,000
She is gentle and has a very professional attitude towards her.

290
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,000
A'Kou, what do you mean by that?

291
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,000
I...

292
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,000
You don't have to ask me.

293
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,000
I will just say it.

294
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:52,000
Mr. Lu, I have always been fond of your beautiful appearance.

295
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:54,000
In the capital, I have He Kexian to compete with you.

296
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,000
Of course, your appearance is more outstanding than him.

297
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,000
So I asked the guard to come and tell me about you.

298
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,000
I don't know how you feel.

299
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,000
So you took over the case.

300
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,000
Brother Lu, I haven't.

301
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,000
I know you should...

302
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:10,000
You know?

303
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
Mr. Lu, don't misunderstand.

304
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:14,000
I just found out your identity.

305
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:16,000
I came here this time

306
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:18,000
to simply admire you.

307
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,000
Mr. Li,

308
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,000
I am sorry.

309
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
Mr. Li.

310
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
Master, what can I do for you?

311
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:30,000
Send me a guest.

312
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,000
Xibao Pavilion is too small.

313
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,000
I can't serve my wife in the future.

314
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,000
Then...

315
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,000
If you are not closed, please stay.

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,000
If you are not closed,

317
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,000
please listen to my advice.

318
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,000
You two, stop!

319
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,000
I'll see you out.

320
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:52,000
I'll see you out.

321
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
Miss Shen, take care.

322
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:02,000
What are you looking at, you ugly girl?

323
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:06,000
I am the guard of the Pavilion.

324
00:15:06,000 --> 00:15:08,000
I am not closed.

325
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,000
Miss Shen, can I talk to you?

326
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:22,000
Brother Lu,

327
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
you really

328
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,200
remember Shen Tongyun's life?

329
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:29,200
Do you still remember

330
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:31,200
the drunkard's death yesterday?

331
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:33,200
I remember it well.

332
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:35,200
Why did you suddenly mention

333
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,200
the drunkard's death yesterday?

334
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:40,000
Of course I remember.

335
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,000
Brother Lu is the owner of Xibao Pavilion.

336
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:44,000
He is the owner of the Pavilion.

337
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:46,000
He is the owner of the Pavilion.

338
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
He is the owner of the Pavilion.

339
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:50,000
Brother Lu is the owner of the Pavilion.

340
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:52,000
He is the owner of the Pavilion.

341
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:54,000
He has a golden hair.

342
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:56,000
What else?

343
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:00,000
What else?

344
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:02,000
I can't remember anything.

345
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,000
Forget it.

346
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,000
But, Ake,

347
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:12,000
the name of the case is serious.

348
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,000
Why do you want to choose Shen Tongyun?

349
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,480
sure.

350
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:18,480
Investigation Officer Dong said

351
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:19,800
he'd stop handing out

352
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,960
Zapans as cons anunciations in the future.

353
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:23,360
My mother

354
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:26,000
can't recur to possibility.

355
00:16:26,520 --> 00:16:29,880
It's only me The best start

356
00:16:29,880 --> 00:16:30,880
I want to choose.

357
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:32,560
But I have no choice.

358
00:16:40,520 --> 00:16:41,760
Shen Tongyun

359
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,760
is seedling

360
00:16:43,760 --> 00:16:44,920
I have another problem.

361
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:46,920
If I become his wife,

362
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:48,240
the official will never

363
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,840
drive me away.

364
00:16:52,920 --> 00:16:54,560
Of course, I know

365
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,000
I should have asked you first.

366
00:16:57,720 --> 00:16:59,160
But I've thought about it.

367
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:00,400
He's the only happy guest

368
00:17:00,680 --> 00:17:02,120
for me now.

369
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,440
I can't offend him.

370
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:06,000
I have no choice.

371
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:08,120
Anyway,

372
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:09,800
I want to be a good official.

373
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:11,080
Since I'm a hard-working official,

374
00:17:11,280 --> 00:17:12,400
I should work hard.

375
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:15,800
Besides,

376
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,760
Lady Shen Xiang likes someone,

377
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:20,200
so she can't be a concubine.

378
00:17:20,560 --> 00:17:22,160
I think her personality

379
00:17:22,280 --> 00:17:23,280
is honest and honest.

380
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,280
She's not mischievous.

381
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,160
It's good.

382
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:28,360
A husband who wants to find his love

383
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:29,680
is not wrong.

384
00:17:30,280 --> 00:17:31,280
I didn't say she's not good.

385
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,880
But I don't like her.

386
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:35,640
You were anxious to see her just now.

387
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:37,360
Now you say you don't like her.

388
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:39,600
Do you like her or not?

389
00:17:44,760 --> 00:17:45,600
You don't understand me.

390
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:46,840
Say no more.

391
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:53,440
What's going on?

392
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:58,720
Why

393
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:02,200
my chest feels stuffy?

394
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,760
Forget it.

395
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,520
Don't be so sad.

396
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:07,840
It seems

397
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:09,640
Brother Lu doesn't want to.

398
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,200
I have to find a replacement

399
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:13,320
to show my talent

400
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,200
and sincerity.

401
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:16,040
I don't want to be a bad person.

402
00:18:34,840 --> 00:18:36,400
The pastries she bought are so delicious.

403
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:37,800
Brother Xian, look.

404
00:18:38,120 --> 00:18:39,400
It's a rabbit.

405
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:40,720
It's so cute.

406
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,120
I'll show you the rabbit.

407
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:50,680
Brother, your skills are getting better.

408
00:18:52,360 --> 00:18:53,120
It's okay.

409
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,840
I bought this for Ke.

410
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:56,240
Ke hasn't been here for a long time.

411
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,560
I finally found a new dessert.

412
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,960
I'm going to send it to him.

413
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:03,200
Ke. Ke.

414
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:04,720
I know Ke.

415
00:19:04,720 --> 00:19:05,600
Brother Xian.

416
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:06,680
Ke.

417
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:08,480
You're here at the right time.

418
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,240
Look.

419
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:09,880
Look.

420
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:11,840
This is the new dessert I specially made for you.

421
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,120
It's so cute.

422
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,600
It's delicious.

423
00:19:17,920 --> 00:19:19,160
If I freeze it again,

424
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,560
it will be a hot summer.

425
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,320
Okay.

426
00:19:21,480 --> 00:19:22,720
I'll freeze it next time.

427
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:23,640
I'll send it to you.

428
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:25,040
Tiantian.

429
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,160
Tiantian.

430
00:19:27,080 --> 00:19:28,040
Brother Xian.

431
00:19:28,520 --> 00:19:30,440
I know you're the best to me.

432
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:32,240
I have a favor to ask you.

433
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,520
Can you help me?

434
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:34,640
Don't...

435
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:35,840
Don't cry.

436
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:37,200
Don't cry.

437
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:37,920
What's the matter?

438
00:19:37,920 --> 00:19:38,840
Let me help you.

439
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:43,800
My mother can't go back to Guanmei Hall now.

440
00:19:44,440 --> 00:19:47,240
Now I'm the only one left to support her.

441
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,880
And that Deng Meiguan always makes things difficult for me.

442
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,480
If I can't be Mei,

443
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,600
how can I explain to my mother

444
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,280
how to make it in Guanmei Hall?

445
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:56,960
Okay. I'll help you.

446
00:19:57,360 --> 00:19:58,120
Brother Xian.

447
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,000
You're my real brother.

448
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:00,880
Let's go.

449
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,080
Where are you taking my brother?

450
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:06,560
Let's go to the temple with Shen Tongyun.

451
00:20:06,560 --> 00:20:06,920
Shi...

452
00:20:06,920 --> 00:20:07,240
Shi...

453
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,560
Shi Fakke.

454
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:09,960
You're so heartless.

455
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,280
I don't believe it.

456
00:20:11,920 --> 00:20:12,440
Brother.

457
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:14,440
Don't let his tears fool you.

458
00:20:14,440 --> 00:20:16,400
He was just pretending.

459
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:17,480
Tiantian.

460
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,400
You're so kind.

461
00:20:19,960 --> 00:20:22,240
I may have been too much just now.

462
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,000
But I'm saying it from the bottom of my heart.

463
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:25,200
Look at Brother Xian.

464
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:26,880
He's at the age of marriage.

465
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:29,600
Shen Tongyun is a good family and a good man.

466
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,400
He's just a man of love and beauty.

467
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:32,560
He's a good match.

468
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,440
Brother.

469
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:37,520
Tell him you like him.

470
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:37,840
Why...

471
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:38,040
Tiantian.

472
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:40,200
Don't talk.

473
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:42,680
Shi Fakke.

474
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:44,440
I'll break up with you if you don't leave today.

475
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:44,960
Tiantian.

476
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:45,960
Brother Xian.

477
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:46,800
Tiantian.

478
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:47,280
Brother Xian.

479
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,000
Don't make a fuss.

480
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:48,800
Tiantian.

481
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:50,160
Brother, don't go.

482
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:52,080
Do you know why he treats you like this?

483
00:20:52,360 --> 00:20:55,160
It's because you don't want to tell Qin Yicheng.

484
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,280
If you dare to go today,

485
00:20:56,480 --> 00:20:58,000
I'll tell him for you.

486
00:20:58,200 --> 00:20:59,560
Tiantian, don't make a fuss, okay?

487
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:01,440
Ake is just a kid.

488
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:02,600
If you tell him like this,

489
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:03,800
you'll scare him.

490
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:04,760
Okay.

491
00:21:05,240 --> 00:21:06,720
I'll leave him alone.

492
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:07,320
No.

493
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:07,960
No.

494
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:09,040
Tiantian.

495
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:11,280
Mountain Master.

496
00:21:11,960 --> 00:21:12,560
Mountain Master.

497
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:14,080
Mountain Master.

498
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,920
Mountain Master, something happened.

499
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,080
Tell me the truth.

500
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:18,480
Since Qi Shaoheng's incident,

501
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,800
Marquis Wu has been watching you.

502
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:21,680
I've met a lot of spies.

503
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:23,160
I dare not alert them.

504
00:21:23,280 --> 00:21:24,200
So I didn't touch them.

505
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,240
Don't touch them.

506
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:29,440
I have a way to let Marquis Wu relax.

507
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:30,600
Mountain Master.

508
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:32,200
I haven't finished yet.

509
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:34,880
Shen Qianjin and Deng Wei are in a relationship.

510
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,000
I only care about Lu Chi's appearance.

511
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:40,320
I didn't expect that he's the master of Xibao Pavilion.

512
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:42,040
Now I'm really satisfied.

513
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,760
But he has a good heart and a good taste.

514
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,600
I'm afraid it's hard to tell.

515
00:21:49,720 --> 00:21:51,120
What's Lu Chi?

516
00:21:51,800 --> 00:21:53,960
He's just a little money

517
00:21:54,200 --> 00:21:55,920
and a little handsome.

518
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,200
But don't forget.

519
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,960
He has no power in the capital

520
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:01,520
and has no foundation.

521
00:22:02,520 --> 00:22:04,760
In fact, it doesn't matter if he's rich or not.

522
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:07,680
I only care about his appearance.

523
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:08,920
Appearance?

524
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:11,680
The husband I chose for you

525
00:22:11,840 --> 00:22:13,600
is also a little handsome.

526
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:15,520
He's definitely not as handsome as Lu Chi.

527
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:16,880
Okay.

528
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:18,000
It doesn't matter if you look at him.

529
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:18,480
Okay.

530
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,600
I hope this young man can also look good.

531
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:24,400
It seems that Doumei Pass

532
00:22:24,560 --> 00:22:26,200
has made it clear to you.

533
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:28,120
I'm afraid that

534
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:30,320
you'll like the news.

535
00:22:30,360 --> 00:22:31,520
It's a coincidence.

536
00:22:31,760 --> 00:22:33,920
I came out of the teahouse with them.

537
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,440
I happened to meet this young lady

538
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,360
and was kicked out of Heji Pass.

539
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,360
Why is Tiantian so fierce all of a sudden?

540
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:43,440
I didn't ask her to think about it.

541
00:22:47,480 --> 00:22:48,800
Then I'm not going to hang up.

542
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:51,200
Okay.

543
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,200
Then we'll see you then.

544
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:53,720
Okay.

545
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,040
And then?

546
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:03,960
And then...

547
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:06,960
You mean

548
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,240
Ake is following Shen Tongyun?

549
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,000
Exactly.

550
00:23:11,720 --> 00:23:13,320
You go and check Shen Tongyun's surrounding.

551
00:23:13,880 --> 00:23:15,160
Especially the secret of the past.

552
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,280
As for Shi Meiguan,

553
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:20,480
you don't have to worry about it.

554
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:24,200
Mountain Master.

555
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,080
In fact, you don't have to care about me so much.

556
00:23:27,080 --> 00:23:28,240
I'm very healthy.

557
00:23:28,240 --> 00:23:28,840
I can...

558
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:31,600
Eat some rice.

559
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:39,620
Dumplings.

560
00:23:41,000 --> 00:23:42,660
He's got dumplings.

561
00:23:42,660 --> 00:23:43,860
Come on, come on.

562
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,700
They're all big cheaters.

563
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:04,140
One said he would entrust the meeting to Fu Ru,

564
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:05,900
but he's fighting with Deng Yi behind his back.

565
00:24:06,340 --> 00:24:07,580
Brother Lu is even worse.

566
00:24:08,020 --> 00:24:09,140
He's playing hard to get.

567
00:24:09,620 --> 00:24:10,620
He refused.

568
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,580
He ran to the door behind my back

569
00:24:12,820 --> 00:24:14,860
and patted my back.

570
00:24:16,660 --> 00:24:18,020
Why are you here, Junior Sister?

571
00:24:24,940 --> 00:24:27,380
You're a bad mouth,

572
00:24:27,580 --> 00:24:28,540
let go of me.

573
00:24:31,340 --> 00:24:32,460
Let go of me.

574
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,900
Ke, are you okay?

575
00:24:38,740 --> 00:24:39,540
It hurts.

576
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:41,500
Don't touch me.

577
00:24:48,940 --> 00:24:50,100
Luckily, it's a bull's wound.

578
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:56,580
You're so busy with your brother.

579
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:58,140
Which one should I call to pick you up?

580
00:25:00,580 --> 00:25:02,260
Don't get in the way.

581
00:25:02,900 --> 00:25:03,700
I know

582
00:25:04,260 --> 00:25:06,100
you like that little lady.

583
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:07,620
Don't worry.

584
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,660
I'll do my best to make you two happy.

585
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:10,860
Make me happy?

586
00:25:12,180 --> 00:25:13,980
You're happy when you make us happy?

587
00:25:14,500 --> 00:25:15,980
You're not angry when you make us happy?

588
00:25:17,420 --> 00:25:18,100
I...

589
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:20,100
I'm not.

590
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,580
Don't talk nonsense.

591
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:23,260
I'm Guan Mei.

592
00:25:23,500 --> 00:25:24,620
I'm happy for Xi Ke.

593
00:25:24,620 --> 00:25:25,940
How can I be unhappy?

594
00:25:26,140 --> 00:25:27,540
I'm happy.

595
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:30,540
Yes, I'm very happy.

596
00:25:30,540 --> 00:25:31,460
Ha ha ha.

597
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:39,060
Okay, as long as you're happy.

598
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:40,980
When I send you back,

599
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,380
you'll be happy again.

600
00:25:51,260 --> 00:25:52,260
It's none of your business.

601
00:25:52,620 --> 00:25:54,540
I can go home even if it hurts.

602
00:25:55,580 --> 00:25:56,580
I can't bear it.

603
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,380
What are you doing?

604
00:26:04,260 --> 00:26:06,660
Brother, why are you here?

605
00:26:06,660 --> 00:26:07,460
If we don't come,

606
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,540
you'll be taken away by her.

607
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,140
I...

608
00:26:12,860 --> 00:26:14,060
She's a stranger.

609
00:26:14,460 --> 00:26:15,900
How can you be so close to her?

610
00:26:16,580 --> 00:26:17,180
Let's go.

611
00:26:17,500 --> 00:26:18,500
I'll take you home.

612
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:21,980
Brother, I want to save my face.

613
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,980
I'll keep an eye on you.

614
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,700
Brother, I don't want to save my face.

615
00:26:35,380 --> 00:26:36,180
You're embarrassing me.

616
00:26:36,180 --> 00:26:37,420
Let me go.

617
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
You're so mad at me.

618
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:47,380
You're so mad at me.

619
00:26:47,780 --> 00:26:49,180
How dare you hit your sister?

620
00:26:49,180 --> 00:26:51,540
You should be punished for that.

621
00:26:51,540 --> 00:26:52,300
Dad,

622
00:26:52,540 --> 00:26:54,260
Ke is going to tell the truth

623
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,100
about Mr. Lu and the Shen Family.

624
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:56,780
Dad,

625
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,340
although he said he was happy,

626
00:26:58,340 --> 00:26:59,340
he's not.

627
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:02,660
Although Lu was a little mean to Ke,

628
00:27:02,660 --> 00:27:03,820
he wasn't.

629
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,900
What if he's really mean to Ke?

630
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:08,060
What if Ke gets angry?

631
00:27:08,060 --> 00:27:10,420
Do we have to be mean to him?

632
00:27:10,420 --> 00:27:11,660
Of course.

633
00:27:11,660 --> 00:27:12,500
Listen,

634
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,740
I'd rather kill a thousand people

635
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:15,220
than let one go.

636
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,860
Besides, Lu has a strange background.

637
00:27:16,860 --> 00:27:18,380
When we're not home,

638
00:27:18,380 --> 00:27:20,220
he'll come to bully your sister

639
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,140
and make her angry.

640
00:27:21,140 --> 00:27:22,260
He's even a little bit naughty.

641
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,260
That's too much.

642
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:23,900
What do you mean?

643
00:27:23,900 --> 00:27:24,780
That's too much.

644
00:27:24,780 --> 00:27:25,780
I can't bear it.

645
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,540
Sister Tang, does it still hurt?

646
00:27:30,340 --> 00:27:31,140
It's okay.

647
00:27:32,940 --> 00:27:34,180
Brother Lu

648
00:27:34,180 --> 00:27:36,340
can't figure out anything.

649
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:38,340
How about I go to find Brother Xian

650
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,860
when he's calmed down?

651
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:41,260
Shen Tong Yun is determined

652
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,740
to marry a handsome man anyway, right?

653
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:44,060
I think so, too.

654
00:27:44,060 --> 00:27:44,700
Let's go.

655
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:47,540
Ke.

656
00:27:47,540 --> 00:27:48,100
Ke.

657
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:49,140
Good girl.

658
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:50,380
You should

659
00:27:50,380 --> 00:27:52,020
take a good rest at home these days.

660
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,340
When I and your two brothers

661
00:27:53,340 --> 00:27:54,540
find a fresh place,

662
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,740
we'll go there to have fun.

663
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,340
Call Brother Xian.

664
00:27:57,340 --> 00:27:57,740
Okay.

665
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,260
Go with him.

666
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:58,940
Okay.

667
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:00,340
Today, two brothers

668
00:28:00,340 --> 00:28:01,820
wrongly blamed Mr. Lu.

669
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:03,740
How about we call him together

670
00:28:03,740 --> 00:28:04,980
and apologize to him?

671
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,060
We'd better go to a place with snacks

672
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:08,820
and eat from the street to the end.

673
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:09,580
That's more fun.

674
00:28:12,220 --> 00:28:13,380
We'll do it now.

675
00:28:13,380 --> 00:28:14,340
Can we?

676
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:15,060
Meng.

677
00:28:15,060 --> 00:28:16,540
Of course we can.

678
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:17,780
But, Ke,

679
00:28:17,780 --> 00:28:18,900
you have to take care of your injury.

680
00:28:18,900 --> 00:28:19,540
Yes.

681
00:28:19,540 --> 00:28:20,940
My brother and I are in trouble.

682
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:22,220
We'll go to the front desk.

683
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:23,700
Okay.

684
00:28:25,220 --> 00:28:26,020
Daughter.

685
00:28:26,020 --> 00:28:27,500
We haven't played chess for a long time.

686
00:28:27,500 --> 00:28:28,540
How about we

687
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:29,420
play chess

688
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:31,100
and play chess together?

689
00:28:31,100 --> 00:28:31,540
Come on.

690
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:32,500
Come on.

691
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,820
Come on.

692
00:28:35,260 --> 00:28:36,580
What's that sound?

693
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:38,220
Why is there a sound of tiles breaking?

694
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,700
Maybe the house is old.

695
00:28:39,700 --> 00:28:40,860
It's time to change the new tiles.

696
00:28:40,860 --> 00:28:42,060
I'll take care of the house.

697
00:28:42,060 --> 00:28:43,780
You two just take care of your sister.

698
00:28:43,780 --> 00:28:45,140
Okay.

699
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,620
Come on.

700
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,140
Do you really need to repair the house?

701
00:28:55,060 --> 00:28:57,060
The injury of the lost lady is not serious.

702
00:28:57,060 --> 00:28:58,460
She'll be fine after a few days' rest.

703
00:28:58,540 --> 00:28:59,580
But I heard

704
00:28:59,580 --> 00:29:01,540
that the lady wants to eat snacks.

705
00:29:01,540 --> 00:29:02,340
Lu Yi.

706
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,980
Take the rest of the shops in Ping'an

707
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,020
and change them all into snack shops.

708
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:06,060
Open the shop three days later.

709
00:29:06,060 --> 00:29:07,300
We'll make the city bigger.

710
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,980
Ke will definitely go.

711
00:29:08,980 --> 00:29:10,700
It's not good for us to

712
00:29:10,700 --> 00:29:11,900
make a big deal at this time.

713
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,740
Shen Tong Yuan is entangled with you.

714
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:16,220
The family doesn't allow you to get close to the lady.

715
00:29:16,220 --> 00:29:18,380
Even the Marquis of Wu'an is investigating your background.

716
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,260
Don't worry.

717
00:29:19,260 --> 00:29:20,140
I'll arrange it for you.

718
00:29:20,140 --> 00:29:21,140
I have my own way.

719
00:29:29,140 --> 00:29:30,540
It's a good place to have a meal.

720
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,540
It's so good.

721
00:29:37,540 --> 00:29:40,340
When will there be another snack street here?

722
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:42,420
There are so many delicious and fun things.

723
00:29:42,420 --> 00:29:44,540
It seems to be specially made for me.

724
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,140
Tiantian doesn't want to come.

725
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:51,140
Are you really going to break up with me?

726
00:29:51,140 --> 00:29:52,500
Ke.

727
00:29:52,500 --> 00:29:53,940
Don't be sad.

728
00:29:53,940 --> 00:29:55,820
Tiantian is just a little bit temperamental.

729
00:29:55,820 --> 00:29:57,580
I'm really going to break up with you.

730
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:58,780
Ke.

731
00:29:58,780 --> 00:30:01,460
You talk so much about Tiantian.

732
00:30:01,460 --> 00:30:03,580
Tiantian must be angry with me.

733
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:04,980
I can see him.

734
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:07,180
I can see Brother Xian.

735
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:08,620
It's fine.

736
00:30:08,620 --> 00:30:09,300
Let's go.

737
00:30:09,300 --> 00:30:10,980
Let's have a meal first.

738
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:11,540
Don't be so polite.

739
00:30:11,540 --> 00:30:12,820
Let's go.

740
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,140
Wait.

741
00:30:14,140 --> 00:30:15,900
Brother Xian won't come.

742
00:30:15,900 --> 00:30:17,340
Where is Brother Lu?

743
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:18,780
Brother Lu...

744
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:21,500
He is busy with the West Treasure Pavilion.

745
00:30:21,500 --> 00:30:23,940
He is very polite and refused our invitation.

746
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:25,660
He said he would definitely come next time.

747
00:30:25,660 --> 00:30:27,420
Yes, he is very polite.

748
00:30:27,460 --> 00:30:29,540
He will definitely come next time.

749
00:30:29,540 --> 00:30:30,740
Let's go.

750
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:33,660
Look at that.

751
00:30:33,660 --> 00:30:35,020
Look at that.

752
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:37,020
Look.

753
00:30:37,020 --> 00:30:38,740
It looks good.

754
00:30:38,740 --> 00:30:40,140
Buy one.

755
00:30:40,900 --> 00:30:41,980
Buy this one.

756
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:42,940
Okay.

757
00:30:43,740 --> 00:30:44,460
No.

758
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:45,140
It's okay.

759
00:30:45,140 --> 00:30:45,820
It's okay.

760
00:30:45,820 --> 00:30:46,100
Let's take a look.

761
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,820
Let's take a look.

762
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:48,380
Let's take a look.

763
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:49,500
Look at this place.

764
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:50,660
Everyone, look.

765
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,980
The top-level treasure.

766
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:53,340
The top-level hairpin.

767
00:30:53,340 --> 00:30:54,300
It hurts.

768
00:30:54,300 --> 00:30:54,900
It's okay.

769
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,660
It's not good-looking.

770
00:30:55,660 --> 00:30:57,260
I can't wear it.

771
00:30:57,820 --> 00:30:59,940
No.

772
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,180
It's not good-looking.

773
00:31:03,540 --> 00:31:04,700
Good.

774
00:31:04,700 --> 00:31:05,620
What?

775
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,220
Good.

776
00:31:06,220 --> 00:31:07,220
Pass.

777
00:31:08,220 --> 00:31:09,020
Please wait.

778
00:31:09,020 --> 00:31:09,540
So beautiful.

779
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,140
Thank you.

780
00:31:10,140 --> 00:31:10,860
Good.

781
00:31:10,860 --> 00:31:12,500
Good.

782
00:31:13,180 --> 00:31:14,380
So beautiful.

783
00:31:14,380 --> 00:31:15,180
So beautiful.

784
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:16,500
It's really beautiful.

785
00:31:17,780 --> 00:31:18,460
Good.

786
00:31:18,460 --> 00:31:19,580
Good.

787
00:31:19,580 --> 00:31:20,140
Brother.

788
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:20,860
Brother, you...

789
00:31:20,860 --> 00:31:21,540
Good.

790
00:31:21,540 --> 00:31:23,140
It's so beautiful.

791
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,340
Brother.

792
00:31:24,340 --> 00:31:25,380
Zhao Hu.

793
00:31:25,380 --> 00:31:26,540
It's so beautiful.

794
00:31:26,540 --> 00:31:27,740
Good.

795
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,540
Come in.

796
00:31:29,900 --> 00:31:31,220
It's so beautiful.

797
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:32,060
Sit.

798
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:32,780
Okay.

799
00:31:32,780 --> 00:31:34,660
It's so beautiful.

800
00:31:35,660 --> 00:31:36,420
Boss.

801
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:37,460
Two bowls of soup noodles.

802
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:38,220
Okay.

803
00:31:38,220 --> 00:31:38,980
Brother Lu.

804
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,620
What did you say?

805
00:31:40,620 --> 00:31:42,140
Why are you hiding from me?

806
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,900
Did you figure it out?

807
00:31:48,900 --> 00:31:50,220
Miss Shen Xiang.

808
00:31:52,660 --> 00:31:53,580
Brother.

809
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:54,460
Drink it.

810
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,460
Taste the soup noodles.

811
00:31:56,860 --> 00:31:57,980
Sir, please wait.

812
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:58,500
Okay.

813
00:32:01,820 --> 00:32:02,780
Soup noodles?

814
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:04,260
It looks good.

815
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,620
I'm hungry.

816
00:32:05,620 --> 00:32:05,900
Sorry.

817
00:32:05,900 --> 00:32:06,900
Brother, I...

818
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:19,100
Come on.

819
00:32:21,460 --> 00:32:22,780
Brother.

820
00:32:22,780 --> 00:32:23,500
Thanks.

821
00:32:24,300 --> 00:32:24,740
Wait a second.

822
00:32:30,460 --> 00:32:30,780
I got lash again.

823
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:33,080
One more.

824
00:32:36,280 --> 00:32:37,040
One more.

825
00:32:43,300 --> 00:32:44,100
Here.

826
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:47,600
Brother.

827
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,900
This is good.

828
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:09,940
Boss, do you have any more ingredients?

829
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,700
There's only one bowl of soup left.

830
00:33:15,260 --> 00:33:15,980
Let me do it.

831
00:33:16,420 --> 00:33:17,140
You go ahead.

832
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,100
Water…

833
00:33:30,180 --> 00:33:32,740
Here, have this too.

834
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:34,900
It's really warm.

835
00:33:38,540 --> 00:33:39,340
Isn't Boss hungry as well?

836
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,780
Boss, you eat.

837
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,340
You're so polite.

838
00:33:45,420 --> 00:33:46,540
Why you do this?

839
00:33:49,300 --> 00:33:50,740
I…

840
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:51,620
I...

841
00:33:51,620 --> 00:33:53,140
I've been full.

842
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:54,860
The taste of the soup powder

843
00:33:54,860 --> 00:33:56,460
is indeed a delicacy of Jin Gu.

844
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,860
Why are you pushing it away?

845
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,220
If you don't want it, I'll eat it.

846
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:00,820
Give it to me.

847
00:34:05,940 --> 00:34:08,260
Second Brother, aren't you full?

848
00:34:17,660 --> 00:34:18,660
I'm full.

849
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:19,660
I'm full.

850
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:21,500
I...

851
00:34:22,500 --> 00:34:23,500
Second Brother.

852
00:34:24,660 --> 00:34:27,020
I have something urgent.

853
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,700
I'll leave first.

854
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:33,740
Didn't you say you only know how to feed the stomach

855
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:34,740
after you eat?

856
00:34:35,820 --> 00:34:37,660
Eldest Brother, you've lost your memory, right?

857
00:34:37,660 --> 00:34:39,260
Look how much you ate.

858
00:34:39,260 --> 00:34:40,260
You must be hungry.

859
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,420
You guys eat first.

860
00:34:46,020 --> 00:34:47,820
Let's meet another day.

861
00:34:47,820 --> 00:34:49,620
Brother Lu, I'm starving.

862
00:34:49,700 --> 00:34:50,780
Let's go find something else to eat.

863
00:34:50,780 --> 00:34:51,380
Let's go.

864
00:34:51,380 --> 00:34:52,380
Okay.

865
00:34:53,020 --> 00:34:54,500
Boss, remember this.

866
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,180
Okay.

867
00:35:00,460 --> 00:35:02,660
Brother Lu, I want to drink this.

868
00:35:08,580 --> 00:35:09,780
Brother Lu.

869
00:35:09,780 --> 00:35:10,780
Ake.

870
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:13,260
We're just shopping today.

871
00:35:13,260 --> 00:35:14,260
We don't need to buy anything.

872
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,380
Okay.

873
00:35:30,580 --> 00:35:31,580
Brother Lu.

874
00:35:31,580 --> 00:35:32,580
Brother Lu.

875
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,580
Brother Lu, what's wrong?

876
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:35,060
Help!

877
00:35:35,060 --> 00:35:36,460
Someone fainted!

878
00:35:37,060 --> 00:35:38,060
Hurry and save him!

879
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:39,380
Help!

880
00:35:40,780 --> 00:35:41,580
How come someone

881
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:42,580
suddenly appeared?

882
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Help!

883
00:35:44,180 --> 00:35:45,180
It seems that

884
00:35:45,180 --> 00:35:47,180
I don't need this time.

885
00:35:47,180 --> 00:35:48,180
Brother Lu.

886
00:35:50,020 --> 00:36:11,180
Are you going to put On von Neumann

887
00:36:11,180 --> 00:36:13,180
and his Shunixa?

888
00:36:17,380 --> 00:36:18,380
I don't.

889
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:21,380
Brother Lu helped me to deal with the trouble.

890
00:36:21,380 --> 00:36:22,980
And you were in prison.

891
00:36:22,980 --> 00:36:24,260
He was the one who helped the prisoners.

892
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,780
He helped you to have a better time in prison.

893
00:36:25,780 --> 00:36:26,460
And...

894
00:36:28,620 --> 00:36:30,380
The death of the chief guard

895
00:36:30,580 --> 00:36:31,620
is probably his doing.

896
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,260
I can't tell you.

897
00:36:33,660 --> 00:36:35,300
If he gets into trouble, it will be bad.

898
00:36:35,700 --> 00:36:37,180
He helped me to defend the prison.

899
00:36:37,460 --> 00:36:38,740
I can't tell you.

900
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,420
Dad should be worried.

901
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:43,300
Anyway, he has been helping me.

902
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:44,980
Didn't the prison

903
00:36:44,980 --> 00:36:46,700
have a relationship with the prison?

904
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:48,700
Did Lu tell you that?

905
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,820
Brother Lu is not a person who forgets to report.

906
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,180
He is just a hot topic.

907
00:36:52,620 --> 00:36:53,820
I've been watching him.

908
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:55,180
He is so strict.

909
00:36:55,580 --> 00:36:56,820
He only guessed a few points.

910
00:36:57,660 --> 00:36:59,580
I must let him catch the bad guy.

911
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,380
I won't let him get away with it.

912
00:37:01,980 --> 00:37:03,900
Don't believe what he said.

913
00:37:03,900 --> 00:37:05,500
Doctor, this way, please.

914
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:05,980
Okay.

915
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:08,540
Doctor, how is he?

916
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,260
He was poisoned.

917
00:37:10,620 --> 00:37:12,020
The poison is not fatal.

918
00:37:12,420 --> 00:37:13,500
But it's strange.

919
00:37:13,940 --> 00:37:14,860
I'm afraid...

920
00:37:15,140 --> 00:37:16,020
What are you afraid of?

921
00:37:16,740 --> 00:37:18,540
I'm afraid that he is ill.

922
00:37:18,540 --> 00:37:19,620
He can't wake up.

923
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,540
I have prescribed the prescription.

924
00:37:21,940 --> 00:37:23,220
Take good care of him.

925
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,540
I'll leave now.

926
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,580
Doctor, take care.

927
00:37:27,340 --> 00:37:27,980
Mom.

928
00:37:28,260 --> 00:37:30,180
Brother Lu was poisoned to save me.

929
00:37:30,180 --> 00:37:31,540
We must take good care of him.

930
00:37:31,900 --> 00:37:32,940
Until he gets better.

931
00:37:34,180 --> 00:37:34,740
Daughter.

932
00:37:35,940 --> 00:37:36,700
I promise you.

933
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,540
I will find the murderer.

934
00:37:38,540 --> 00:37:41,380
But let's let him go back to his home first.

935
00:37:41,380 --> 00:37:42,660
He lives next door.

936
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:43,180
How about...

937
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:44,620
How about sending him to the clinic?

938
00:37:45,500 --> 00:37:46,140
Mom.

939
00:37:46,740 --> 00:37:48,060
If it wasn't for Brother Lu and me,

940
00:37:48,060 --> 00:37:50,100
I would be the one lying in there now.

941
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:50,460
No way.

942
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:51,340
He is my savior.

943
00:37:51,340 --> 00:37:52,900
How can we be ungrateful?

944
00:37:52,900 --> 00:37:53,820
Daughter.

945
00:37:54,420 --> 00:37:55,580
Don't worry.

946
00:37:56,020 --> 00:37:57,940
Let's go in and see Mr. Lu first.

947
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:07,820
Chongshan.

948
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:09,860
Why are you hiding?

949
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:10,740
Come here.

950
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:17,380
I...

951
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:21,940
Tell me the truth.

952
00:38:22,820 --> 00:38:23,580
Why does the powder

953
00:38:23,580 --> 00:38:24,860
look so similar to the white powder

954
00:38:24,860 --> 00:38:26,700
on Mr. Lu's clothes?

955
00:38:27,220 --> 00:38:27,740
You...

956
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,420
Did you poison him?

957
00:38:29,580 --> 00:38:30,100
I...

958
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:33,740
Dad.

959
00:38:34,060 --> 00:38:35,020
Please tell me.

960
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:36,780
Brother, do you know it too?

961
00:38:38,460 --> 00:38:39,380
Tell me.

962
00:38:39,380 --> 00:38:40,180
What are you talking about?

963
00:38:41,060 --> 00:38:41,620
No.

964
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:43,100
Don't be angry, madam.

965
00:38:43,500 --> 00:38:44,340
Here's the thing.

966
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:47,300
This new master has been with Ake all the time.

967
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,820
I warned him before.

968
00:38:48,980 --> 00:38:49,700
If he listens to me,

969
00:38:49,700 --> 00:38:51,020
we'll be safe and sound.

970
00:38:51,020 --> 00:38:52,100
But he's so stubborn.

971
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:53,420
He doesn't know how to be a good boy.

972
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:55,820
So I asked him to put some

973
00:38:55,820 --> 00:38:56,940
menganese in it.

974
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,620
It's not poison.

975
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:58,540
It's really not poison.

976
00:38:58,540 --> 00:38:59,540
He just took it.

977
00:38:59,540 --> 00:39:00,100
You...

978
00:39:02,380 --> 00:39:03,180
Madam, please calm down.

979
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:04,420
How can you do this?

980
00:39:05,460 --> 00:39:06,260
Then there must be

981
00:39:06,260 --> 00:39:07,500
a big one in here.

982
00:39:08,940 --> 00:39:09,940
There is.

983
00:39:09,940 --> 00:39:10,980
Brother Huai.

984
00:39:10,980 --> 00:39:12,500
Are you confused?

985
00:39:12,700 --> 00:39:13,340
You even said

986
00:39:13,340 --> 00:39:14,340
you'd send him back.

987
00:39:14,740 --> 00:39:15,660
If he goes back,

988
00:39:15,660 --> 00:39:16,580
he'll accuse you of

989
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:17,580
harming your father.

990
00:39:17,580 --> 00:39:18,580
What should he do?

991
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:19,700
Harming?

992
00:39:19,700 --> 00:39:20,500
No way.

993
00:39:22,460 --> 00:39:23,580
From now on,

994
00:39:23,580 --> 00:39:25,100
take good care of Mr. Lu

995
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
until he recovers.

996
00:39:26,900 --> 00:39:27,980
Then sincerely

997
00:39:27,980 --> 00:39:29,300
apologize to him.

998
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,100
After he recovers,

999
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,420
I'll teach you a lesson.

1000
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,900
I know, mom.

1001
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,020
Second, come here.

1002
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:41,060
I told you to put less.

1003
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:42,140
Put less.

1004
00:39:42,180 --> 00:39:42,980
Put less.

1005
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:44,420
Did you put too much?

1006
00:39:44,420 --> 00:39:45,420
A little bit.

1007
00:39:46,220 --> 00:39:47,180
Brother Lu.

1008
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:48,300
I'll take care of you.

1009
00:39:48,900 --> 00:39:50,220
You must get well soon.

1010
00:39:56,660 --> 00:39:57,900
Even if you don't say it,

1011
00:39:58,940 --> 00:39:59,820
I know

1012
00:40:01,380 --> 00:40:02,660
you always save me.

1013
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:13,420
Come.

1014
00:40:16,980 --> 00:40:18,100
Why are you here?

1015
00:40:19,300 --> 00:40:20,460
I'm here to apologize

1016
00:40:20,460 --> 00:40:21,740
to you.

1017
00:40:22,380 --> 00:40:23,060
Say it.

1018
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:23,900
Say it.

1019
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:25,340
Brother.

1020
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:26,620
We were wrong.

1021
00:40:26,980 --> 00:40:27,980
Wrong?

1022
00:40:34,740 --> 00:40:36,420
You poisoned him, right?

1023
00:40:36,420 --> 00:40:37,500
No.

1024
00:40:37,500 --> 00:40:38,380
What did you poison him with?

1025
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:39,620
Do you know it'll kill him?

1026
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,300
We didn't poison him.

1027
00:40:41,340 --> 00:40:42,900
We just put some

1028
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:44,060
Menhan medicine.

1029
00:40:44,060 --> 00:40:45,020
You...

1030
00:40:45,020 --> 00:40:45,740
I'm a doctor.

1031
00:40:45,740 --> 00:40:46,900
Don't worry.

1032
00:40:46,900 --> 00:40:47,660
Well, Ake.

1033
00:40:47,660 --> 00:40:48,660
I'll ask your two brothers

1034
00:40:48,660 --> 00:40:49,260
to take care of him.

1035
00:40:49,260 --> 00:40:50,060
You go back and have a rest.

1036
00:40:50,060 --> 00:40:50,460
Okay?

1037
00:40:50,460 --> 00:40:51,540
I don't want to.

1038
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,940
I'll take care of my own people.

1039
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,900
Ake.

1040
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:55,180
You're not married yet.

1041
00:40:55,180 --> 00:40:56,940
It's not good to take care of others.

1042
00:40:56,940 --> 00:40:58,180
If it's spread out,

1043
00:40:58,180 --> 00:40:59,220
well...

1044
00:40:59,220 --> 00:41:00,740
You two don't have to talk about marriage.

1045
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:01,220
Right.

1046
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,300
We should take care of our reputation.

1047
00:41:02,300 --> 00:41:03,300
Right.

1048
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:05,500
Shen Tongyun

1049
00:41:05,500 --> 00:41:07,620
has fallen in love with Brother Lu.

1050
00:41:07,620 --> 00:41:09,380
Brother Lu hasn't replied to me yet.

1051
00:41:09,380 --> 00:41:11,140
If it's spread out,

1052
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:12,660
well,

1053
00:41:12,660 --> 00:41:14,100
you two take care of him.

1054
00:41:14,100 --> 00:41:15,300
If anything goes wrong with him,

1055
00:41:15,300 --> 00:41:16,420
I'll ignore you.

1056
00:41:16,420 --> 00:41:18,060
Don't worry.

1057
00:41:18,060 --> 00:41:19,300
Go back and have a rest.

1058
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,540
Be good.

1059
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:22,060
Go back.

1060
00:41:22,060 --> 00:41:23,780
Take care of him.

1061
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,100
Okay.

1062
00:41:24,100 --> 00:41:25,380
Be good.

1063
00:41:29,300 --> 00:41:30,220
Dad.

1064
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:31,660
Did we poison him?

1065
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:32,780
I just asked my second brother.

1066
00:41:32,780 --> 00:41:34,380
Did you poison him?

1067
00:41:41,140 --> 00:41:42,820
Why hasn't he woken up yet?

1068
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,460
Did you not take care of him?

1069
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,380
No.

1070
00:41:45,380 --> 00:41:46,420
Look at him.

1071
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:47,820
Go.

1072
00:41:50,260 --> 00:41:51,260
Go.

1073
00:41:51,260 --> 00:41:52,260
Go.

1074
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:53,260
Go.

1075
00:41:53,260 --> 00:41:54,260
Go.

1076
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:55,260
Go.

1077
00:41:55,260 --> 00:41:56,260
Go.

1078
00:41:56,260 --> 00:41:57,260
Go.

1079
00:41:57,260 --> 00:41:58,260
Go.

1080
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,260
Go.

1081
00:41:59,260 --> 00:42:00,260
Go.

1082
00:42:00,260 --> 00:42:01,260
Go.

1083
00:42:01,260 --> 00:42:02,260
Go.

1084
00:42:02,260 --> 00:42:03,260
Go.

1085
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:04,260
Go.

1086
00:42:04,260 --> 00:42:05,260
Go.

1087
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,260
Go.

1088
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:07,260
Go.

1089
00:42:07,260 --> 00:42:08,260
Go.

1090
00:42:08,260 --> 00:42:09,260
Go.

1091
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,260
Go.

1092
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,260
Brother Lu.

1093
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:14,260
Brother Lu.

1094
00:42:15,260 --> 00:42:16,260
Brother Lu.

1095
00:42:20,260 --> 00:42:21,260
He's awake.

1096
00:42:21,260 --> 00:42:22,260
Great.

1097
00:42:22,260 --> 00:42:23,260
Old man.

1098
00:42:23,260 --> 00:42:24,260
He's awake.

1099
00:42:24,260 --> 00:42:25,260
I'm awake.

1100
00:42:26,260 --> 00:42:28,260
It's good that he's awake.

1101
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:29,260
Old man.

1102
00:42:29,260 --> 00:42:30,260
Hurry up.

1103
00:42:30,260 --> 00:42:31,260
Take him home.

1104
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:32,260
Okay.

1105
00:42:32,260 --> 00:42:33,260
Okay.

1106
00:42:33,260 --> 00:42:34,260
Little sister.

1107
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,260
Mr. Lu.

1108
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:17,260
I know this meeting is the grace of fate

1109
00:43:17,260 --> 00:43:24,260
Every time I see you, I only have a cute stubbornness

1110
00:43:24,260 --> 00:43:30,260
Although I can't remember every difficult day

1111
00:43:30,260 --> 00:43:35,260
I never forget the first time

1112
00:43:35,260 --> 00:43:40,260
Even if this love is endless, endless, endless

1113
00:43:40,260 --> 00:43:42,260
It doesn't matter if it's a stormy month

1114
00:43:42,260 --> 00:43:47,260
As long as you are fearless, fearless, and carefree

1115
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:50,260
I'll guard the coffin

1116
00:43:50,260 --> 00:43:53,260
It doesn't matter if it's a fire in the world

1117
00:43:53,260 --> 00:43:57,260
Will there be any border

1118
00:43:57,260 --> 00:44:01,260
I'll protect you

1119
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:06,260
Even if I can't see you

1120
00:44:06,260 --> 00:44:11,260
I'll protect you

1121
00:44:11,260 --> 00:44:15,260
I'll love you all my life

1122
00:44:15,260 --> 00:44:19,260
Even if I can't see you

1123
00:44:19,260 --> 00:44:25,260
I'll love you all my life

1124
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,260
Even if the world is in chaos

1125
00:44:29,260 --> 00:44:32,260
It doesn't matter if it's the same as before

1126
00:44:32,260 --> 00:44:39,260
Please remember the young man who used to be so cold

1127
00:44:39,260 --> 00:44:48,260
From now on, he is unwilling to part with you
