to be her matchmaker.

137
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,090
Are you going to disregard
a client's wishes?

138
00:07:11,390 --> 00:07:13,120
That doesn't seem very proper, does it?

139
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:15,490
You're talking complete nonsense.

140

Do you know that

Shen Tongyun has already entrusted me
with her matchmaking case.

How could I allow you to
mess things up again?

152
00:07:43,270 --> 00:07:44,330
What are you doing?

153
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:46,730
Ouch!

154
00:07:46,750 --> 00:07:47,440
Ouch!

155

let me give you some friendly advice.

159
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,180
Please stop pointing fingers at me,

160
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:05,120
or Mr. Lu might think you're bullying me

161
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,040
because I'm young, beautiful,
and kind-hearted.

162
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,110
It would be a shame if you got hurt.

163

You...

If anyone dares to bully my wife again,

165
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,280
I'll make them...

166
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:15,240
Pay for it.

00:08:19,070 --> 00:08:19,810
Ke!

What's your relationship with him?

171
00:08:23,750 --> 00:08:25,490
It's nothing.

172
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,820
He's just injured and lost his memory,

173
00:08:27,820 --> 00:08:29,780
and insists I'm his unmarried wife.

174
00:08:28,310 --> 00:08:28,600
[Invitation]

175
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:30,950
But Ke,

176
00:08:31,070 --> 00:08:31,960
with his looks

177
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,080
and how protective he is of you,

178
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,679
marrying him wouldn't be a bad deal.

179
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,669
Marriage Broker Zhao, stop joking around.

180
00:08:36,669 --> 00:08:38,600
His mind isn't right at the moment.

181
00:08:38,669 --> 00:08:39,890
When he's lucid,

182
00:08:39,909 --> 00:08:41,700
he's always staring at Shen Tongyun.

183
00:08:41,700 --> 00:08:44,560
Did he say he likes Shen Tongyun?

184
00:08:45,620 --> 00:08:47,130
He hasn't actually said so,

185
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,460
but there's definitely something there.

186
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:55,530
Shi Fa'ke!

187
00:08:58,120 --> 00:08:59,720
Let me make this clear to you,

188
00:08:59,870 --> 00:09:02,400
Shen Tongyun has personally asked me

189
00:09:02,510 --> 00:09:04,310
to handle her matchmaking case.

190
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:07,070
As the Chief Matchmaker of
the Official Matchmaking Agency,

191
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:08,930
I order you to organize the documents
for me right now

192
00:09:08,930 --> 00:09:10,240
and stop loitering around here.

193
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:10,840
Ms. Deng,

194
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:14,240
there's no rule saying one matchmaker
gets exclusive rights to a client.

195
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:17,080
Besides, Lu Chi and He Kexian,
who Shen Tongyun is interested in,

196
00:09:17,080 --> 00:09:18,590
are both close to me.

197
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,750
So naturally, I should
be the one handling this case.

198
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:24,520
The Official Matchmaking Agency
should be supportive

199
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:26,030
and let the most capable person
do the job.

200
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:27,360
That won't be necessary.

201
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,020
The portrait of

202
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,340
the man I found Shen Tongyun

203
00:09:30,340 --> 00:09:31,550
has already been viewed by her,

204
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:33,270
and she's quite pleased with it.

205
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,280
I'll only believe this

206
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:36,100
when Miss Shen

207
00:09:36,120 --> 00:09:37,050
says so herself.

208
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,670
If you also want to work on
this matchmaking case,

209
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:40,530
then may the best matchmaker win.

210
00:09:42,550 --> 00:09:43,160
Let's go.

211
00:09:45,510 --> 00:09:47,390
Shi Fa'ke, you...

212
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:57,230
Brother Lu.

213
00:09:57,750 --> 00:09:59,810
I need to clear something up with you.

214
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,740
Little girl, you remember me?

215
00:10:04,670 --> 00:10:06,170
You're the one with amnesia,

216
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:08,170
why are you asking if I remember you?

217
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:10,020
We agreed, didn't we?

218
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,300
You are my wife,

219
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:12,820
and once you come of age,

220
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:14,280
I will marry you, alright?

221
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,770
That poison was really strong.

222
00:10:20,150 --> 00:10:21,750
Your brain is truly damaged.

223
00:10:21,960 --> 00:10:24,840
Brother Lu, you're starting to
talk nonsense.

224
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:27,630
This is not bad too.

225
00:10:27,790 --> 00:10:29,950
Stay close to me, don't get lost.

226
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:31,630
Or someone with ulterior motives

227
00:10:31,630 --> 00:10:33,250
might trick you into signing
a loan or something

228
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:35,550
and then Xibao Pavilion
would be in trouble.

229
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:37,020
You're right, Wifey.

230
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,450
I've told you, I'm not your wife.

231
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:42,770
You seem foolish,

232
00:10:42,960 --> 00:10:44,360
yet you're not confused.

233
00:10:45,870 --> 00:10:47,400
Of course I'm not confused.

234
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,850
Brother Lu, let me ask you,

235
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:52,910
tell me the truth.

236
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:56,080
You were following Shen Tongyun...

237
00:10:56,630 --> 00:10:58,690
Is she the person you're looking for?

238
00:10:59,350 --> 00:11:00,180
No.

239
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:04,850
Then Shen Tongyun is your little girl?

240
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,870
No.

241
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:06,850
You like her.

242
00:11:06,890 --> 00:11:07,880
No.

243
00:11:07,910 --> 00:11:09,250
I'm not your wife.

244
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,860
You are.

245
00:11:11,830 --> 00:11:14,340
See? You're still confused.

246
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:18,620
I don't like anyone else.

247
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:24,680
Brother Lu, your memory's a mess and

248
00:11:24,840 --> 00:11:27,170
you don't remember what happened before.

249
00:11:27,670 --> 00:11:29,370
But don't worry.

250
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,600
This happened because of me.

251
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,960
I will take good care of you

252
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,150
until you recover.

253
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:39,990
If you never recover,

254
00:11:40,940 --> 00:11:42,460
I'll take care of you for life.

255
00:11:42,460 --> 00:11:43,320
For real?

256
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:45,250
Then I can still stay at your home?

257
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,370
You must have been scared

258
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,250
by my father and brothers, right?

259
00:11:49,300 --> 00:11:50,030
Don't worry.

260
00:11:50,050 --> 00:11:51,910
I, Shi Fa'ke, always keep my word.

261
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:54,830
Well, I want to see
some paintings and calligraphy.

262
00:11:54,840 --> 00:11:56,000
Paintings and calligraphy?

263
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:56,960
Sure.

264
00:11:57,150 --> 00:11:58,950
I'll take you to Xibao Pavilion.

265
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,200
Maybe you'll even remember something.

266
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:03,960
But my family is definitely not
shirking responsibility.

267
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:05,730
I'll make sure you're healed.

268
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:08,060
However, when you see Sister Pan'er,

269
00:12:08,150 --> 00:12:10,080
please don't tell her it was my brothers

270
00:12:10,080 --> 00:12:10,960
who caused you to get hurt.

271
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,350
Otherwise, if she reports to
the authorities,

272
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:13,300
my brothers will be finished.

273
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:14,180
Alright, I understand.

274
00:12:14,180 --> 00:12:15,370
My lips are sealed.

275
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:17,050
Let's go, quickly.

276
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:18,040
Let's go.

277
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,860
[Yunlou Painting Shop]

278
00:12:28,570 --> 00:12:31,380
Brother Lu, why aren't we
going to Xibao Pavilion?

279
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,590
Doesn't Xibao Pavilion have more famous
paintings and calligraphy?

280
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,340
I really like this place, Ke.

281
00:12:42,850 --> 00:12:45,420
Although these aren't
famous paintings and calligraphy,

282
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:46,880
they have real character.

283
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:48,400
Not bad.

284
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,440
It seems I was shortsighted

285
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:51,900
and didn't notice this place.

286
00:12:51,900 --> 00:12:54,230
If you like it, let's find the owner
and ask about the price.

287
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:56,180
Hello? Is anyone here?

288
00:13:03,530 --> 00:13:04,900
Miss Shen?

289
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:06,820
Why are you here?

290
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,680
The owner is my friend.

291
00:13:08,940 --> 00:13:10,400
He stepped out for a while.

292
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,530
And you two?

293
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:18,470
Miss Shen.

294
00:13:18,510 --> 00:13:20,060
Please don't misunderstand

295
00:13:20,060 --> 00:13:21,150
Haven't you heard?

296
00:13:21,350 --> 00:13:23,740
Brother Lu has lost his memory.

297
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:29,900
Are you trying to take advantage of him

298
00:13:29,900 --> 00:13:31,040
while he's confused?

299
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,090
Shi Fa'ke, you're a marriage broker!

300
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,390
I asked you to arrange my match first,

301
00:13:34,390 --> 00:13:35,540
how could you steal my man?

302
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,970
No, no, no, I'm not.

303
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:39,410
-Okay, since you're
not trying to steal him...
-You misunderstood me.

304
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:41,140
Why didn't you visit me sooner?

305
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:43,550
Miss Shen,

306
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:46,670
after meeting with Marriage Broker Deng,

307
00:13:46,780 --> 00:13:48,540
do you still want to marry Lu Chi?

308
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,940
Marriage Broker Deng approached me first.

309
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:53,390
She's the Chief Matchmaker of
the Official Matchmaking Agency.

310
00:13:53,390 --> 00:13:54,910
I couldn't really say no.

311
00:13:55,930 --> 00:13:58,370
I'm sure Ms. Deng found you a good match.

312
00:13:59,870 --> 00:14:01,940
Now, Lu is still recovering
from his injuries.

313
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,310
If you want to change your mind,

314
00:14:03,310 --> 00:14:03,630
I would...

315
00:14:03,630 --> 00:14:04,440
I didn't.

316
00:14:04,790 --> 00:14:07,020
Ms. Deng said it's just an introduction.

317
00:14:07,020 --> 00:14:09,110
No commitment was made.

318
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:12,790
To be honest,

319
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,440
Brother Lu was poisoned and injured

320
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,770
trying to save me.

321
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:19,800
He has now lost all his past memories...

322
00:14:19,830 --> 00:14:21,590
I will see to it that he recovers.

323
00:14:21,590 --> 00:14:22,440
As for you,

324
00:14:23,020 --> 00:14:24,680
if you've no feelings for him,

325
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,520
then let's be clear about it.

326
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:27,750
He's injured?

327
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:30,680
And it was because he was saving someone?

328
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,220
He's handsome

329
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:34,660
and has a kind heart too.

330
00:14:34,930 --> 00:14:36,730
Thank goodness his face is fine.

331
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:38,170
How about this?

332
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,380
Bring him to my home,

333
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:41,110
I have many maids and servants,

334
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:43,120
I'll make sure he lives in comfort.

335
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:45,470
Fine clothes and food go without saying,

336
00:14:45,810 --> 00:14:47,630
but I'll also get
the best doctors to treat him.

337
00:14:47,630 --> 00:14:49,690
Even if he never gets his memory back,

338
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,400
you're still willing to take care of him?

339
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,600
Marriage Broker Shi.

340
00:14:52,690 --> 00:14:54,620
As long as you can make this happen,

341
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,420
I'll entrust my marriage to you,

342
00:14:56,550 --> 00:14:59,210
and I won't go through with
Ms. Deng's proposal.

343
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,750
But I've already asked Brother Lu,

344
00:15:02,750 --> 00:15:04,150
he said he's not willing.

345
00:15:04,510 --> 00:15:06,040
Maybe it's best to let it go.

346
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,070
Marriage Broker Shi.

347
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,000
Is it Lu Chi who's unwilling,

348
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:12,180
or is it you who's unwilling
due to personal motives?

349
00:15:12,180 --> 00:15:13,530
As a marriage broker,

350
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,550
you're sabotaging a client's case.

351
00:15:15,550 --> 00:15:17,710
You must be the first in agency history.

352
00:15:17,710 --> 00:15:19,930
No, no, no, I have no personal motives,

353
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,680
but you should ask for his opinion too.

354
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,700
Why don't we wait a few more daysâ€”

355
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:26,460
though he has lost his memory,

356
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,850
he's not completely unaware.

357
00:15:28,870 --> 00:15:30,240
If you have no personal motives,

358
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:31,480
and he's not a fool,

359
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:32,740
why wait any longer?

360
00:15:33,470 --> 00:15:34,330
How about this?

361
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,400
Let me spend some time with him

362
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:36,540
with you around.

363
00:15:36,570 --> 00:15:38,430
Let him decide. What do you think?

364
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:44,920
That's... fine.

365
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,110
Ke, let's wait for
the painting shop owner,

366
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:48,690
I've taken a liking to a painting.

367
00:15:48,690 --> 00:15:50,580
The owner of this painting shop
is my close friend,

368
00:15:50,580 --> 00:15:52,970
Mr. Lu, if you like something,
just let me know.

369
00:15:52,970 --> 00:15:54,670
Who are you?

370
00:16:05,060 --> 00:16:06,080
Miss Shen,

371
00:16:06,400 --> 00:16:08,180
he's lost his memory and
is wary of strangers,

372
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:09,310
please understand.

373
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:10,710
It's fine.

374
00:16:12,750 --> 00:16:13,760
Miss Shen,

375
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,340
are you really going to be this direct?

376
00:16:16,340 --> 00:16:18,340
I've always been straightforward.

377
00:16:18,460 --> 00:16:19,890
Just ask him how he feels,

378
00:16:19,990 --> 00:16:20,920
and I'll listen.

379
00:16:22,660 --> 00:16:23,690
Brother Lu,

380
00:16:24,090 --> 00:16:26,090
Miss Shen here has feelings for you,

381
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:27,660
and even though you've lost your memory,

382
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,810
she's willing to take care of you
for the rest of your life.

383
00:16:29,810 --> 00:16:31,270
How do you feel about this?

384
00:16:31,580 --> 00:16:33,300
Would you be willing to marry her?

385
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:33,940
No.

386
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:36,180
Do you understand what marriage means?

387
00:16:36,180 --> 00:16:36,810
I do.

388
00:16:37,270 --> 00:16:38,870
It means two people who love each other,

389
00:16:38,870 --> 00:16:39,870
living together,

390
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:41,120
and never parting.

391
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:43,680
But I don't have feelings for her,

392
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:45,070
nor do I need her care,

393
00:16:45,710 --> 00:16:46,690
so I refuse.

394
00:16:51,780 --> 00:16:52,680
I understand.

395
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,130
What do you understand?

396
00:16:55,150 --> 00:16:57,470
Lu Chi, if you're not interested,
I'll back off.

397
00:16:57,470 --> 00:16:59,750
You're not the only
handsome man in the capital.

398
00:16:59,750 --> 00:17:01,820
I, Shen Tongyun, can find someone else.

399
00:17:01,820 --> 00:17:04,079
Ms. Deng's candidate is waiting anyway.

400
00:17:07,470 --> 00:17:08,359
Oh no.

401
00:17:09,460 --> 00:17:11,520
I forgot about Marriage Broker Deng.

402
00:17:12,250 --> 00:17:13,990
[Shi's Mansion]

403
00:17:14,040 --> 00:17:15,480
[Yachun House]

404
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,250
What should I do?

405
00:17:21,150 --> 00:17:22,920
Brother Lu rejected Shen Tongyun,

406
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,920
and yet I'm actually happy about it!

407
00:17:25,940 --> 00:17:26,560
But...

408
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,160
But Shen Tongyun's case

409
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:31,270
is about to be snatched by Ms. Deng.

410
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,490
In this whole capital,

411
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:36,680
who else is as desperate to get married
as Shen Tongyun?

412
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:39,910
Should I arrange marriages
for my two brothers instead?

413
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:47,040
Come in.

414
00:17:55,190 --> 00:17:56,040
Mr. Lu.

415
00:17:56,950 --> 00:17:59,340
I specially prepared a
brain-boosting tonic for you

416
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:01,940
that will help you
recover your memory faster.

417
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:06,050
Here, drink it quickly.

418
00:18:06,230 --> 00:18:08,140
It loses effect once it cools.

419
00:18:08,510 --> 00:18:09,440
Second Brother,

420
00:18:09,670 --> 00:18:11,330
you never talk this much to me.

421
00:18:12,230 --> 00:18:13,320
So you really...

422
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:31,960
Ke! Ke!

423
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:37,150
Ke.

424
00:18:37,430 --> 00:18:38,570
I'll take you now to expose

425
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,770
Lu Chi's true colors.

426
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,310
Let's go.

427
00:18:44,510 --> 00:18:45,360
Master!

428
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:47,360
Master.

429
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:48,880
I'm here to admit my fault.

430
00:18:49,150 --> 00:18:50,580
According to your original plan,

431
00:18:50,580 --> 00:18:52,090
I was to pose as an assassin
and poison her,

432
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:52,950
and you would heroically save her,

433
00:18:52,950 --> 00:18:54,340
and pretend to faint from the attack.

434
00:18:54,340 --> 00:18:55,040
This way, we could

435
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,620
make Marquis Wu'an lower his guard,

436
00:18:56,620 --> 00:18:58,510
and make Miss Shi

437
00:18:58,620 --> 00:19:00,650
grateful to you, making everything easier.

438
00:19:00,650 --> 00:19:03,230
It would also resolve Shen Tongyun's
obsession with you,

439
00:19:03,230 --> 00:19:05,230
killing three birds with one stone.

440
00:19:05,430 --> 00:19:06,830
But I never expected that Shi Chongshan

441
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,490
would make his move before me.

442
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:11,060
We might as well turn this
to our advantage.

443
00:19:11,190 --> 00:19:11,860
Moreover,

444
00:19:12,190 --> 00:19:13,680
you've gathered very detailed information

445
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,050
on Shen Tongyun's people.

446
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,380
However, we didn't meet
the person in question today.

447
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,650
It seems I'll need to take Ke there again.

448
00:19:20,130 --> 00:19:22,400
By the way, any news from Marquis Wu'an?

449
00:19:22,510 --> 00:19:23,620
Just as you predicted,

450
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,780
once he learned about your memory loss,

451
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:26,140
he stopped investigating you.

452
00:19:26,140 --> 00:19:27,230
But Marriage Broker Deng

453
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,810
has already arranged for Li Ang
and Shen Tongyun

454
00:19:28,810 --> 00:19:29,820
to meet tomorrow.

455
00:19:30,100 --> 00:19:32,100
How will you get away to turn up?

456
00:19:32,190 --> 00:19:32,540
I...

457
00:19:32,540 --> 00:19:34,380
Ke, let me tell you something.

458
00:19:34,670 --> 00:19:37,270
Second Brother went to
deliver medicine to Lu Chi.

459
00:19:37,270 --> 00:19:38,880
I think Lu Chi suspected him

460
00:19:38,930 --> 00:19:40,500
and detained Second Brother!

461
00:19:40,500 --> 00:19:41,970
I've told you before,

462
00:19:42,110 --> 00:19:43,840
this Lu Chi is not a good person.

463
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,200
Eldest Brother.

464
00:19:50,370 --> 00:19:51,000
Lu Chi.

465
00:19:51,880 --> 00:19:55,140
-Chongshan, what's wrong with you?
-What did you do to him?

466
00:19:55,150 --> 00:19:56,080
Eldest Brother.

467
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:57,750
It has nothing to do with me.

468
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,020
Your brother brought me medicine,

469
00:19:59,020 --> 00:20:00,450
I said it was too hot,
so I'll drink it later.

470
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:01,620
He insisted it wasn't hot

471
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:02,820
and took a sip himself.

472
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:03,380
And then...

473
00:20:03,380 --> 00:20:05,480
You little brat,
still playing dumb with me?

474
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:06,550
My brother drugged it himself,

475
00:20:06,550 --> 00:20:07,750
why would he need to test it?

476
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:09,010
Ke, you saw what happened.

477
00:20:09,010 --> 00:20:10,760
Even Chongshan fell into his trap.

478
00:20:10,760 --> 00:20:12,890
This guy hasn't lost his memory at all.

479
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,390
He drugged it himself?

480
00:20:19,580 --> 00:20:22,040
It's just a knockout drug, not poison.

481
00:20:23,250 --> 00:20:24,580
Knockout drug!

482
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:29,580
Ke, you've heard everything now.

483
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,750
Eldest Brother.

484
00:20:31,750 --> 00:20:33,750
Will you quietly take Second Brother away,

485
00:20:33,750 --> 00:20:35,000
or should I go tell Mother now?

486
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:35,610
No, no, no.

487
00:20:37,070 --> 00:20:38,330
I'll let you off today.

488
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,420
Brother Lu, I'm really sorry.

489
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,640
Please get some rest.

490
00:20:45,190 --> 00:20:45,790
Ke.

491
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,930
I'm a bit scared to be alone.

492
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:52,960
Well...

493
00:20:59,960 --> 00:21:00,860
Come in then.

494
00:21:22,950 --> 00:21:24,270
You're still scared?

495
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:26,850
With you here, I'm not afraid.

496
00:21:29,300 --> 00:21:30,760
The night is long,

497
00:21:30,950 --> 00:21:32,360
if you're bored,

498
00:21:32,510 --> 00:21:33,530
let's play a game.

499
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:34,550
What game?

500
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:36,190
Wait for me.

501
00:21:45,970 --> 00:21:48,300
This is a game I've played
since I was a kid.

502
00:21:50,630 --> 00:21:51,880
We'll grab the paper cranes.

503
00:21:51,880 --> 00:21:54,480
The loser gives the winner
a shoulder massage.

504
00:21:55,020 --> 00:21:55,920
Ready?

505
00:21:55,180 --> 00:21:57,420
â™ª Beneath twilight and moonlight â™ª

506

Actually, I don't blame you.

594

It's understandable that

595

you don't want to marry her.

596
00:26:23,460 --> 00:26:25,980
After all, she's proposed to
every handsome man

in the capital.

598
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:31,440
Indeed. That Miss Shen
has quite a reputation.

599
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,220
What reputation?

I can see you have
deep feelings for Miss Shen,

620
00:27:16,850 --> 00:27:18,580
so why won't you propose to her?

I...

622
00:27:21,270 --> 00:27:22,600
Some opportunities

623
00:27:22,770 --> 00:27:25,540
will be lost if you don't pursue them.

624
00:27:26,350 --> 00:27:27,960
Yun has loved beauty since childhood,

625
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:29,620
while I am ordinary-looking.

626
00:27:30,120 --> 00:27:32,320
She would never choose someone like me.

627
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:35,660
How can you confuse
loving beauty with loving a person?

628
00:27:36,910 --> 00:27:40,300
Shen Tongyun has indeed
pursued many handsome men,

629
00:27:40,670 --> 00:27:42,770
but it was always one-sided.

630
00:27:42,850 --> 00:27:44,310
I don't think she's happy.

631
00:27:44,900 --> 00:27:46,630
But when she's with you,

632
00:27:47,010 --> 00:27:48,940
her smile is gentle and beautiful.

633
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:50,700

634

she does have some feelings for you.

Besides, you two grew up together

The worst that could happen

643
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:08,120
is that she marries someone else,

644

Besides, if you go in with Wang Ren,

00:36:51,750 --> 00:36:53,670
I'll personally deliver the
Information Cards to your homes.

841
00:36:53,670 --> 00:36:55,870
Miss Shen, what do you think?

842
00:37:08,330 --> 00:37:09,130
Excuse me,

843
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,450
Ms. Deng, what did you just say?

844
00:37:10,450 --> 00:37:13,100
This is a good match,
it shouldn't be delayed.

845
00:37:13,370 --> 00:37:17,170
Why don't I exchange Information Cards
for you two tomorrow?

846
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,190
Marriage Broker Deng,

847
00:37:19,190 --> 00:37:21,470
I think there's no need to rush.

848
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:23,840
General Li and I have just met,

849
00:37:24,130 --> 00:37:26,190
and I don't know his temperament yet.

850
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,520
In my opinion,

851
00:37:27,540 --> 00:37:29,310
we should get to know
each other better first,

852
00:37:29,310 --> 00:37:31,570
before discussing this matter further.

853
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:34,740
[Soothing as Gentle Wind]

854
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:35,020
Miss Shen.

855
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:36,370
In that case,

856
00:37:36,390 --> 00:37:38,680
I'll arrange

857
00:37:38,710 --> 00:37:40,250
another meeting for you two.

858
00:37:40,250 --> 00:37:41,380
How does that sound?

859
00:37:42,450 --> 00:37:44,260
That would be appreciated, Ms. Deng.

860
00:37:44,260 --> 00:37:45,450
It's no trouble,

861
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:46,680
it's my duty.

862
00:37:45,690 --> 00:37:50,200
[Soothing as Gentle Wind]

863
00:37:47,660 --> 00:37:48,680
I'll take my leave now.

864
00:37:48,680 --> 00:37:49,540
General Li!

[Shen's Mansion]

866
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:02,720

[Shen's Mansion]

868
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:04,990
General Li!

869
00:38:05,710 --> 00:38:06,820
Please slow down.

870
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:10,360
They came out so quickly.

871
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:13,060
Seems like Shen Tongyun
didn't ask them to stay.

872
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:14,080
The match isn't made yet.

873
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:15,870
Scholar Wang still has a chance.

874
00:38:15,870 --> 00:38:16,750
Ke is right.

875
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:19,130
Let's go.

[Shen's Mansion]

877
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,730
General Li.

[Shen's Mansion]

879
00:38:31,550 --> 00:38:32,810
Who does she think she is,

880

daring to be so picky and refuse me!

881
00:38:35,120 --> 00:38:36,340
By coming to meet her,

882
00:38:36,340 --> 00:38:37,840
I'm already granting her great honor.

883
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:38,610
Yes, indeed.

884
00:38:38,630 --> 00:38:40,430
Doesn't she know who my uncle is?

885
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,170
Please calm down, General Li.

886
00:38:43,330 --> 00:38:45,340
Although Shen Tongyun doesn't know
what's good for her,

887
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,460
please don't worry.

888
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:47,580
I have my ways.

889
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:49,430
I'll make sure she accepts
this marriage proposal.

890
00:38:49,430 --> 00:38:51,370
She won't even accept
the Information Card now.

891
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,770
What can you possibly do?

892
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:54,910
Didn't she just say

893
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,270
you two don't know each other well enough?

894
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:59,780
Then we'll find opportunities for you
to get better acquainted.

895
00:38:59,780 --> 00:39:00,550
I've heard

896
00:39:00,550 --> 00:39:03,480
she often visits
Carefree Restaurant for tea.

897
00:39:03,570 --> 00:39:04,680
In the next few days,

898
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:07,010
I'll invite her to the restaurant for tea.

899
00:39:07,150 --> 00:39:08,950
General Li, please be patient for now.

900
00:39:08,950 --> 00:39:10,670
Once Miss Shen becomes your wife,

901
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:12,400
you can teach her a lesson then.

902
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:13,830
My patience has limits.

903
00:39:13,830 --> 00:39:14,780
Yes, of course.

904
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,460
Take care,

905
00:39:15,530 --> 00:39:16,900
take care, General Li!

[Shen's Mansion]

907
00:39:26,750 --> 00:39:28,950
You think this will stump me?

908

You're all too green.

909
00:39:35,590 --> 00:39:37,210
If I remember correctly,

910
00:39:37,230 --> 00:39:38,680
this Carefree Restaurant

911
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:40,450
is right next to
Scholar Wang's painting shop.

912
00:39:40,450 --> 00:39:42,580
That's right. You remembered correctly.

913
00:39:42,580 --> 00:39:43,970
Scholar Wang once mentioned

914
00:39:43,970 --> 00:39:46,530
that he often chats with
Miss Shen at Carefree Restaurant.

915
00:39:46,530 --> 00:39:47,870
In that case,

916
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:49,390
this Shen Tongyun,

917
00:39:49,420 --> 00:39:51,420
although she falls for
every handsome man she meets,

918
00:39:51,420 --> 00:39:53,740
she has remained close to Scholar Wang

919
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:54,710
for years.

920
00:39:55,430 --> 00:39:56,780
I must help Scholar Wang

921

get another chance.

922
00:39:58,340 --> 00:39:59,220
Then I'll go with you.

923
00:39:59,220 --> 00:40:00,350
Don't make trouble.

924
00:40:00,580 --> 00:40:02,240

You two are finally meeting again.

928
00:40:13,630 --> 00:40:15,280
Since our last meeting,

929
00:40:15,310 --> 00:40:17,530
I haven't been able to forget Miss Shen.

930
00:40:18,220 --> 00:40:19,710
General Li, you flatter me.

931
00:40:19,710 --> 00:40:21,950
I think General Li is brave and refined,

932
00:40:21,970 --> 00:40:23,230
a handsome gentleman.

933
00:40:24,140 --> 00:40:25,410
Come, have some tea.

934

Miss Shen, so this is where you are.

935
00:40:31,020 --> 00:40:33,420
Scholar Wang was just
hoping to invite you for tea.

936
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:35,150
What a fortunate coincidence.

937
00:40:35,270 --> 00:40:36,930
Why don't we all sit together?

938
00:40:40,770 --> 00:40:42,900
What does General Li think about this?

00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:54,600
Shi Fa'ke.

940
00:40:54,850 --> 00:40:57,450
I suggest you give up early,

941
00:40:57,780 --> 00:41:00,320
or when the match fails,

942
00:41:00,400 --> 00:41:03,710
how will you and your client save face?

943
00:41:05,670 --> 00:41:07,480
Marriage Broker Deng, you worry too much.

944
00:41:07,480 --> 00:41:08,770
As a marriage broker,

945
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,920
as long as my client finds a good match,

946
00:41:10,920 --> 00:41:12,310
there's nothing to be ashamed about.

947
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,390
Making a hundred visits

948
00:41:13,390 --> 00:41:14,920
to arrange one successful marriage

949
00:41:14,920 --> 00:41:16,520
is still a worthy endeavour.

950
00:41:17,140 --> 00:41:18,680
As for my client,

951
00:41:18,700 --> 00:41:20,690
being devoted and persistent
toward someone they like

952
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:22,620
is nothing to be ashamed of either.

953
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:28,760
I wonder what General Li

954
00:41:28,780 --> 00:41:30,920
likes to do for entertainment?

955
00:41:30,980 --> 00:41:32,300
I am a military man,

956
00:41:32,330 --> 00:41:33,390
and usually...

957
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,340
Although General Li is a military man,

958
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:39,170
he also enjoys reading
poetry and literature,

959
00:41:39,200 --> 00:41:41,800
and appreciating
paintings and calligraphy.

960
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:44,700
General Li and I share the same interests?

961
00:41:44,880 --> 00:41:45,550
Indeed.

962
00:41:46,720 --> 00:41:49,520
Which artist's paintings
does General Li admire?

963
00:41:50,020 --> 00:41:51,550
The most renowned in the capital

964
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:53,280
are the works of Mr. Lin Yuan.

965
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:56,370
I'm quite fond of his paintings.

966
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:00,320
So what do you think

967
00:42:00,350 --> 00:42:01,970
is special about Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings?

968
00:42:01,970 --> 00:42:03,850
Which of his works do you admire the most?

969
00:42:03,850 --> 00:42:05,950
I like all of his works.

970
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:07,700
May I ask which of his paintings

971
00:42:07,700 --> 00:42:09,700
you have in your collection at home?

972
00:42:14,010 --> 00:42:15,870
I don't have any in my collection.

973
00:42:17,980 --> 00:42:20,340
Our Scholar Wang runs a painting shop,

974
00:42:20,540 --> 00:42:23,440
he's quite knowledgeable
about these paintings, isn't he?

975
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:24,310
Not at all.

976
00:42:24,610 --> 00:42:25,780
My humble painting shop

977
00:42:25,780 --> 00:42:28,310
only sells works
from lesser-known artists.

978
00:42:28,400 --> 00:42:29,880
Though they're not famous yet,

979
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:32,100
they all have distinctive personal styles.

980
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:33,340
Some are bold and powerful,

981
00:42:33,340 --> 00:42:35,070
others are serene and elegant.

982
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:35,960
As for me,

983
00:42:36,070 --> 00:42:38,170
I particularly favor
the works of Gushan Sou.

984
00:42:38,170 --> 00:42:40,440
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings
are indeed excellent

985
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:41,660
and highly sought after.

986
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,280
But I always feel his paintings

987
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:45,480
lack a certain warmth of everyday life.

988
00:42:45,640 --> 00:42:47,280
He seems distant from us.

989
00:42:47,700 --> 00:42:48,660
So,

990
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:51,020
I also prefer the works of Mr. Gushan.

991
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:55,570
Even friends need to
share common interests,

992
00:42:55,570 --> 00:42:57,730
all the more so for husband and wife,

993
00:42:57,760 --> 00:42:59,010
with hearts that beat as one,

994
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,810
only then can the marriage last.

995
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:06,000
Waiter!

996
00:43:06,780 --> 00:43:08,210
Why is it taking so long to serve the tea?

997
00:43:08,210 --> 00:43:08,660
Tea's here.

998
00:43:08,660 --> 00:43:09,380
Hurry up!

999
00:43:13,450 --> 00:43:14,480
Sir, your tea.

1000
00:43:17,230 --> 00:43:18,350
Sir, please forgive me.

1001
00:43:18,350 --> 00:43:19,380
Please forgive me, sir.

1002
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,380
I'm so sorry, sir.

1003
00:43:20,700 --> 00:43:21,240
Forgive me.

1004
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,900
I'll clean this up right away.

1005
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,940
It's not easy making a living out here.

1006
00:43:39,940 --> 00:43:41,200
Your legs were shaking when serving tea.

1007
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,200
I suspect your boss
has been docking your pay.

1008
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:45,260
You probably don't get enough to eat.

1009
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:52,500
Take this to buy yourself some food.

1010
00:43:56,260 --> 00:43:57,500
Thank you, sir.

1011
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,860
Sir, thank you.

1012
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:01,800
Thank you, sir.

1013
00:44:02,130 --> 00:44:04,480
Miss Shen, did you see that?

1014
00:44:04,690 --> 00:44:05,880
Our General Li

1015
00:44:05,900 --> 00:44:07,440
is not only accomplished
in both civil and military affairs,

1016
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:09,960
but also generous and kind-hearted.

1017
00:44:10,630 --> 00:44:12,930
He's a perfect match.

1018
00:44:13,020 --> 00:44:14,360
Unlike certain people

1019
00:44:14,480 --> 00:44:17,090
who always have ulterior motives,

1020
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:20,480
like a frog dreaming of
marrying a princess.

1021
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:21,330
You!

1022
00:44:21,780 --> 00:44:22,580
What did I say?

1023
00:44:22,960 --> 00:44:24,830
General Li truly has great presence.

1024
00:44:24,830 --> 00:44:26,470
I am very pleased.

1025
00:44:27,630 --> 00:44:28,690
That's wonderful!

1026
00:44:29,240 --> 00:44:30,500
Since that's the case,

1027
00:44:30,530 --> 00:44:32,700
tomorrow happens to be the 9th,

1028
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,720
a good day for discussing marriage.

1029
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:37,640
Why don't I deliver the documents and
Information Cards tomorrow,

1030
00:44:37,640 --> 00:44:39,500
so your marriage can be confirmed early?

1031
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:42,030
Miss Shen, what do you think?

1032
00:44:44,980 --> 00:44:45,740
Very well.

1033
00:44:45,770 --> 00:44:47,430
I'll go back and inform my father.

1034
00:44:47,430 --> 00:44:48,340
Okay.

1035
00:44:49,180 --> 00:44:50,340
Thank you, Ms. Deng.

1036
00:44:50,360 --> 00:44:51,450
It's nothing.

1037
00:44:55,650 --> 00:44:57,880
Tongyun, let me walk you out.

1038
00:44:59,770 --> 00:45:01,500
Marriage Broker Shi, goodbye.

1039
00:45:03,480 --> 00:45:05,120
You can talk all you want,

1040
00:45:05,150 --> 00:45:06,280
but what good will it do?

1041
00:45:06,280 --> 00:45:08,740
Tomorrow I'll deliver
the Information Cards.

1042
00:45:08,740 --> 00:45:10,200
Only half a day remains.

1043
00:45:10,270 --> 00:45:11,740
Whatever you're planning to do,

1044
00:45:11,740 --> 00:45:13,190
I'm afraid it's too late.

1045
00:45:16,240 --> 00:45:17,500
As long as Ms. Deng acts

1046
00:45:18,200 --> 00:45:20,530
in good conscience, I have nothing to say.

1047
00:45:30,200 --> 00:45:30,900
Brother Lu.

1048
00:45:30,920 --> 00:45:32,250
That Li Ang came well-prepared.

1049
00:45:32,250 --> 00:45:33,680
Our tea-spilling plan failed.

1050
00:45:33,680 --> 00:45:35,990
Ms. Deng will deliver
the Information Cards tomorrow.

1051
00:45:35,990 --> 00:45:36,990
What should we do?

1052
00:45:37,010 --> 00:45:37,940
Don't worry, Ke.

1053
00:45:38,180 --> 00:45:39,160
First, stop Miss Shen from leaving.

1054
00:45:39,160 --> 00:45:40,360
Bring her back to watch a show.

1055
00:45:40,360 --> 00:45:42,280
This time, I'll handle it myself.

1056
00:45:42,590 --> 00:45:43,500
I'll guarantee your success.
