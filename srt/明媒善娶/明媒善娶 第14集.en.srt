No. I'm a bit scared.

Don't be afraid.

Come on, I'll ride with you.

that their hearts are aligned.

482

If their hearts truly speak as one,

and Mr. Lu shows his sincerity,

484
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:36,740
he'll win Yanyan's heart.

485

But the Zhu family is
the Prime Minister's household,

How did things go?

674
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,450
Zhuxi, don't be discouraged.

675
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:06,910
You should know

676
00:34:06,930 --> 00:34:09,889
Lord Zhu cherishes and loves
his granddaughter above all else.

677
00:34:09,889 --> 00:34:11,199
So he should think carefully

678
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,570
when it comes
to choosing a husband for her.

679
00:34:12,570 --> 00:34:14,790
It's normal
we don't succeed in just one attempt.

680

Besides, he didn't refuse you either.

681
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,909
Don't be discouraged.

682
00:34:26,540 --> 00:34:28,590
Yanyan endured hardship in her childhood,

683
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,550
yet she remains optimistic and cheerful.

684
00:34:30,550 --> 00:34:31,750
After we're married,

685
00:34:32,070 --> 00:34:33,610
I must treat her better.

686
00:34:36,840 --> 00:34:39,100
I'll marry no one but Yanyan in this life.

687
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:44,310
Since you said that,

688
00:34:44,310 --> 00:34:45,710
as your marriage broker,

689
00:34:45,820 --> 00:34:47,620
I'll see this through to the end.

690
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:49,280
Think about all the matches I made before.

691
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,010
None of them succeeded on the first try.

692
00:34:51,010 --> 00:34:51,840
Rest assured.

693
00:34:52,179 --> 00:34:54,500
I'll make sure you marry her.

00:35:05,110 --> 00:35:06,350
I see.

696
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:10,590
I refused that man
from Xibao Pavilion today.

697
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:12,650
So you're angry, right?

698
00:35:13,880 --> 00:35:16,590
Yanyan, you can tell me

699
00:35:16,700 --> 00:35:18,010
what you think.

700

Grandfather.

701
00:35:22,520 --> 00:35:25,120
I do have feelings for Mr. Lu.

702
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,590
He is well-educated
but wouldn't take the imperial exams.

703
00:35:27,590 --> 00:35:30,080
Even with his family's vast wealth,

704
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:31,930
he's still just a merchant.

705
00:35:32,710 --> 00:35:34,460
A match like this isn't considered proper.

706
00:35:34,460 --> 00:35:36,460
Have you thought about what it means

707
00:35:36,590 --> 00:35:38,120
to marry into such a family?

708
00:35:38,470 --> 00:35:39,440
Grandfather,

709
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:42,630
being an official doesn't mean
one can be worry-free for life.

710
00:35:42,630 --> 00:35:43,620
Besides,

711
00:35:43,650 --> 00:35:46,240
I want to marry someone I truly love.

712
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:49,800
I don't care about his status,
family background, or official rank.

713
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,300
I agree with you.

714
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:54,660
I'll judge him solely by character.

715
00:35:55,090 --> 00:35:59,340
He's sweet-tongued now,

716
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:01,640
but what about the future?

717
00:36:01,920 --> 00:36:04,080
How long can his affection last?

718
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,380
Grandfather.

719
00:36:06,210 --> 00:36:08,560
Grandfather. Do you remember

720
00:36:09,030 --> 00:36:11,160
I was in danger at the Flower Assembly?

721
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:14,210
He rescued me from the fire

722
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,650
without any hesitation.

723
00:36:15,820 --> 00:36:18,090
In that moment of peril, he was decisive.

724
00:36:18,320 --> 00:36:20,940
I believe he is a reliable person.

725
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:23,100
Such a deed

726
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:25,000
may prove his character,

727
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,830
but it's not enough to prove his nature.

728
00:36:28,610 --> 00:36:31,720
A real man should show persistence

729
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,230
and unwavering courage.

730
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:35,800

731
00:36:35,840 --> 00:36:37,840
If his feelings for you are sincere,

732
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:40,620
he should prove it to me,

733
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,940
instead of letting you

734
00:36:42,960 --> 00:36:44,540
plead with me.

735

I brought you this.

You want to ask about my feelings for you?

I told Miss Shi and my brother today

that I'll marry no one but you.

how many successful matches
the Official Matchmaking Agency

who should be the Chief Matchmaker

You should go back and rest early.

842
00:42:19,550 --> 00:42:20,140
You too.

843
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:23,380
Ke!

844
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:24,430
Come here!

845
00:42:24,470 --> 00:42:25,220
You go there!

846
00:42:27,510 --> 00:42:28,040
You...

847
00:42:28,150 --> 00:42:29,280
Xianxian, Chongshan,

848
00:42:29,280 --> 00:42:30,420
tell me

849
00:42:30,590 --> 00:42:31,790
where you went first.

850
00:42:35,070 --> 00:42:36,470
-I...
-I...

851
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:39,020
Xianxian.

852
00:42:39,760 --> 00:42:42,460
The moon is so beautiful tonight, right?

853
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:45,340
Yes, look how big the moon is!

854
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,290
Go.

855
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,520
Xianxian, Chongshan, I'm leaving.

856
00:42:55,510 --> 00:42:56,330
Lu Chi!

857
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:57,250
You...

858
00:42:57,350 --> 00:42:58,810
Don't let me see you again.

859
00:42:59,140 --> 00:42:59,710
Ke!

860
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:00,230
Ke!

861
00:43:00,230 --> 00:43:01,160
I'm going to bed!

862
00:43:03,210 --> 00:43:03,970
Oh, no.

863
00:43:04,270 --> 00:43:05,920
Father told us to keep an eye on Ke.

864
00:43:05,920 --> 00:43:07,570
It seems she went on a date
with Lu Chi again.

865
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,470
Not "seems." She did.

866
00:43:09,890 --> 00:43:10,690
Don't worry, Xianxian.

867
00:43:10,690 --> 00:43:11,620
We still have Father.

868
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:13,970
That's right, we still have Father.

869
00:43:14,470 --> 00:43:15,870
So it's not a big problem.

870
00:44:08,360 --> 00:44:09,000
You...

871
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:25,480
Lu.

872
00:44:29,670 --> 00:44:31,190
Ke, you're here.

873
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:34,140
Lu.

874
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:36,140
Do you think

875
00:44:36,360 --> 00:44:37,400
if we don't see each other for days,

876
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:38,460
when we meet again,

877
00:44:38,630 --> 00:44:40,090
we'd be happier than before?

878
00:44:40,090 --> 00:44:41,550
Why should we not see each other for days?
