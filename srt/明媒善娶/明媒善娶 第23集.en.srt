I've long recognized Lu Chi
as my brother-in-law.

Lu Chi is indeed a fine young man,

worthy of our Ke.

496

Dear,

497

the children are waiting for you to speak.

498

This young man is not bad.

499
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:12,900
Uncle, Aunt.

500
00:28:13,360 --> 00:28:15,680
The people of Mount Qianya
appear to be bandits,

501

but we're actually warriors
who secretly assist

the Emperor, protect the state,

and eliminate traitors.

504
00:28:21,800 --> 00:28:22,990
My earlier concealment

505
00:28:22,990 --> 00:28:24,390
was out of necessity.

506
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:26,140
But now that peace has been restored

507
00:28:26,140 --> 00:28:27,640
and the traitors
have been brought to justice,

508
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:28,940
I should explain everything clearly

509
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,200
to ease your concerns.

510
00:28:30,730 --> 00:28:31,810
From beginning to end,

511
