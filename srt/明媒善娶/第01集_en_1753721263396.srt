1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,340
Mister, I saw someone

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:04,100
who's the sexy girl,

3
00:00:04,100 --> 00:00:05,780
and he looks exactly like her.

4
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:07,140
I,rÃ©miya,

5
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,700
have already said

6
00:00:09,700 --> 00:00:11,880
that the split foot

7
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:14,320
are such a good fit and yes.

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,040
And what about others?

9
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,420
Can't be more video saved on Jasper's recently posted my video.

10
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:23,740
There are more steps,

11
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:24,780
right?

12
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,300
You will see it when it comes right here.

13
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:31,300
The Long Ballad

14
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:37,300
The Long Ballad

15
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:39,300
Episode 2

16
00:01:57,300 --> 00:01:59,300
I want to buy a new one.

17
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:01,300
I want to buy one too.

18
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,300
Let's go.

19
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:05,300
I want to buy one too.

20
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,300
Let's go.

21
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,300
Let's go.

22
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,300
Let's go.

23
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,300
Let's go.

24
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,300
Let's go.

25
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,300
Let's go.

26
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:19,300
There are so many people in the shop.

27
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,300
Are we late?

28
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:23,300
Please wait a moment.

29
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,300
My wife will be here soon.

30
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,300
My wife will be here soon.

31
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:29,300
Yes.

32
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:31,300
Shi Bak is here.

33
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,300
Tiantian, you are the vice president.

34
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:51,300
Why don't you be the host?

35
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,300
You want me to be the president?

36
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:55,300
I'm just a dreamer.

37
00:03:07,300 --> 00:03:09,300
Sorry for keeping you waiting.

38
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,300
I'm the president of Qianjin Club.

39
00:03:11,300 --> 00:03:13,300
I'm responsible for the success of the secret.

40
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:15,300
I found a new item recently.

41
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,300
I found a new item recently.

42
00:03:17,300 --> 00:03:19,300
Look.

43
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,300
This is the new shared prison

44
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:23,300
of Qianjin Club.

45
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:25,300
It's cool in summer and warm in winter.

46
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:27,300
It's warm in summer and warm in winter.

47
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,300
I think it's not appropriate.

48
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:31,300
The headmaster must be an outsider.

49
00:03:31,300 --> 00:03:33,300
Yanyan is the headmaster of the county.

50
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,300
There are maids and servants outside.

51
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,300
How can a normal girl like us be able to afford it?

52
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,300
How can a normal girl like us be able to afford it?

53
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:41,300
Come on.

54
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,300
The flower shop

55
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,300
is specially equipped with women's clothes for sisters.

56
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:47,300
The women's clothes

57
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:49,300
and different colored clothes

58
00:03:49,300 --> 00:03:51,300
are all used for traveling.

59
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,300
More importantly,

60
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:55,300
the travel route will be strictly confidential.

61
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,300
How can we calculate the cost?

62
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,300
How can we calculate the cost?

63
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,300
The sisters of Qianjin Club

64
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:03,300
can come to the free shared prison today.

65
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:05,300
If you know the price,

66
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:07,300
you can get a discount.

67
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,300
So, sisters,

68
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:11,300
listen to me.

69
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,300
Manager Li,

70
00:04:13,300 --> 00:04:15,300
please write down all the terms.

71
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:17,300
You can't know the cost.

72
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:19,300
Sisters,

73
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,300
go to see Manager Li and register.

74
00:04:21,300 --> 00:04:23,300
Okay.

75
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:25,300
I want to register.

76
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:27,300
I want to register.

77
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
I want to register.

78
00:04:29,300 --> 00:04:31,300
Shi Fak,

79
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:33,300
you don't do the job you want to do.

80
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:35,300
You sell goods for Xibao Pavilion.

81
00:04:35,300 --> 00:04:37,300
Be careful, you can't finish the job this month.

82
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:39,300
A few days later, it's the time of the festival.

83
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:41,300
Tao Yi will drive you out

84
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:43,300
and you can't get the gold medal

85
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:45,300
of the best in the world.

86
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:47,300
There are celebrities crying there.

87
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,300
It's nothing.

88
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:53,300
There are two days left until the end of the month.

89
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:55,300
Even if today is the last day,

90
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:57,300
I still have three or two close friends.

91
00:04:57,300 --> 00:04:59,300
Don't beat my idea.

92
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,300
I've already made up my mind.

93
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:03,300
You two are really enemies.

94
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Don't be so self-willed.

95
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,300
I think it's our Yan Yan.

96
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,300
And our Yan Yan is so beautiful.

97
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:11,300
It's time to find a good husband

98
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:13,300
to spend the rest of our lives together.

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:15,300
You asked me out because of this?

100
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:17,300
No, no.

101
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:19,300
Ake, don't ask me out again.

102
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,300
I have to go back to read the script.

103
00:05:21,300 --> 00:05:23,300
I'll go first.

104
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:25,300
Yan Yan, protect your eyes.

105
00:05:27,300 --> 00:05:29,300
Come one by one.

106
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,300
It's all here.

107
00:05:31,300 --> 00:05:33,300
Manager Li.

108
00:05:37,300 --> 00:05:39,300
Who?

109
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,300
You run the Xibao Pavilion as a food market.

110
00:05:41,300 --> 00:05:43,300
This is the way to sell in the Pavilion.

111
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:45,300
It's a good harvest.

112
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,300
Wow, my beauty is in full swing.

113
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,300
Young Master,

114
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,300
you look so handsome.

115
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,300
You look so good.

116
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,300
I'm a beauty.

117
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:01,300
If you're not married, you can look for me.

118
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:03,300
This is...

119
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:05,300
This lady sells fish.

120
00:06:05,300 --> 00:06:07,300
Have you ever thought that although this business is popular,

121
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,300
it's not suitable for everyone.

122
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:10,300
As always,

123
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,300
the wind of life is like a fan.

124
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:14,300
Yes.

125
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,300
Young Master,

126
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:18,300
is this lady helping you?

127
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,300
Is it a good intention?

128
00:06:20,300 --> 00:06:21,300
Forget it.

129
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,300
You can send Mr. Li Yuan's words.

130
00:06:23,300 --> 00:06:25,300
I've sent it long ago.

131
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:27,300
Follow me.

132
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,300
Qu An Qi Mei.

133
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,300
You know that we are not good at writing.

134
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,300
You can help us.

135
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:42,300
Let me see.

136
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:44,300
No.

137
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:02,300
Sister Tang, are you okay?

138
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:04,300
Young Master, excuse me.

139
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
I heard that you have Mr. Li Yuan's new work.

140
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:08,300
I'm here to see it.

141
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:10,300
Yes.

142
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:12,300
Young Master, we are the same.

143
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:14,300
I admire Mr. Li Yuan.

144
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,300
I heard that he has a new work.

145
00:07:16,300 --> 00:07:18,300
Let's watch it together.

146
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:22,300
I'll send it now.

147
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:24,300
Ladies, this way, please.

148
00:07:24,300 --> 00:07:26,300
I just introduced myself.

149
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,300
I'm Mei Guan from Guan Mei Hall.

150
00:07:28,300 --> 00:07:30,300
My surname is Shi.

151
00:07:30,300 --> 00:07:32,300
I'm Shi Fa Ke.

152
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,300
My mother is the handmaid of Guan Mei Hall.

153
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:36,300
I'm the first heir of the first Mei.

154
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:38,300
Can she help me?

155
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:44,300
Since you want to talk,

156
00:07:44,300 --> 00:07:46,300
this way, please.

157
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,300
Let's go.

158
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Look at this.

159
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:58,300
It's Mr. Li Yuan's pen.

160
00:07:58,300 --> 00:08:00,300
This painting

161
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:02,300
is made for my mother.

162
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,300
If this painting is not finished,

163
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
maybe it can be my saviour.

164
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,300
I want this painting.

165
00:08:08,300 --> 00:08:10,300
It's a good painting.

166
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:12,300
It's a perfect painting.

167
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,300
You like this painting?

168
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,300
Of course I like it.

169
00:08:16,300 --> 00:08:18,300
Look, the meaning of this painting

170
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,300
is clearly in line with my profession.

171
00:08:20,300 --> 00:08:22,300
As a beauty, I hope my beauty

172
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:24,300
can be in love with each other and be perfect.

173
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:26,300
Oh my god.

174
00:08:26,300 --> 00:08:28,300
Is it because Mr. Li Yuan and I have a connection?

175
00:08:28,300 --> 00:08:30,300
This is clearly made for me.

176
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:32,300
Do you like this painting?

177
00:08:32,300 --> 00:08:34,300
Sister Tan Er, please give me a price.

178
00:08:34,300 --> 00:08:36,300
I want this painting.

179
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:38,300
He Ke Tian, you know this is my favourite painting.

180
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:40,300
Why do you want to buy it?

181
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:42,300
This...

182
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:44,300
Can it be sold?

183
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:46,300
Painting is for appreciation.

184
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:48,300
Of course it can be sold to the one who has a connection.

185
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,300
How much is it?

186
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:52,300
300 taels.

187
00:08:52,300 --> 00:08:54,300
500 taels.

188
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:56,300
What? You want to buy a painting too?

189
00:08:56,300 --> 00:08:58,300
Mr. Li Yuan's painting is rare.

190
00:08:58,300 --> 00:09:00,300
I'm just trying to prove that you are a good family.

191
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,300
You two don't have to be too hard on each other.

192
00:09:02,300 --> 00:09:04,300
You don't know that I'm the master of the house.

193
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:06,300
You only know to make trouble for me.

194
00:09:10,300 --> 00:09:12,300
If no one gives me a price,

195
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:14,300
I'll...

196
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:16,300
800 taels. I won't give you any cash.

197
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:18,300
Manager Li, he's not doing anything this month.

198
00:09:18,300 --> 00:09:20,300
He can't get any cash.

199
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:22,300
I'll do it.

200
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:24,300
He Ke Tian,

201
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:26,300
do you believe that I don't have cash?

202
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,300
Shi Fa Ke, I'll be so mad at you one day.

203
00:09:28,300 --> 00:09:30,300
Sister Han Shan, let's go.

204
00:09:30,300 --> 00:09:32,300
Let's settle the score.

205
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:34,300
Okay.

206
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,300
My painting!

207
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,300
What else do you want?

208
00:09:44,300 --> 00:09:46,300
It's indeed a bit urgent.

209
00:09:46,300 --> 00:09:48,300
Although I'm the one who likes the painting,

210
00:09:48,300 --> 00:09:50,300
I can't be the one who's in need.

211
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,300
What do you mean by that?

212
00:09:52,300 --> 00:09:54,300
I think the young master is a little strange.

213
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:56,300
I know a lot about the young master in the capital.

214
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,300
But I've never seen you before.

215
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:02,300
I'm new to the capital today.

216
00:10:02,300 --> 00:10:04,300
You're new?

217
00:10:04,300 --> 00:10:06,300
That's great.

218
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:08,300
I wonder which family you want to talk about.

219
00:10:08,300 --> 00:10:10,300
I just met with Shi Mei Guan today.

220
00:10:10,300 --> 00:10:12,300
We can't talk about marriage.

221
00:10:12,300 --> 00:10:14,300
If we get married,

222
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,300
we'll go to Guanmei Hall.

223
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,300
I have something else to do. I'll go first.

224
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
Wait, young master.

225
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
I think you came for Mr. Lin Yuan.

226
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:24,300
But why didn't you agree to it when I was with my best friend?

227
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:26,300
A gentleman doesn't take his love.

228
00:10:26,300 --> 00:10:28,300
Since you two like this painting so much,

229
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:30,300
I don't want to be a good painter.

230
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,300
I...

231
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:36,300
It seems that you have no money to buy a painting.

232
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:38,300
You're still full of words and don't want to be a good painter.

233
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:40,300
I didn't expect you to be so outstanding.

234
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,300
But you're so vain.

235
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:44,300
Wait.

236
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:46,300
He just said he was going to Guanmei Hall.

237
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:48,300
I don't know why he's so eager to see you.

238
00:10:48,300 --> 00:10:50,300
I'm not going to Guanmei Hall.

239
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:52,300
He just said he was going to Guanmei Hall.

240
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:54,300
It seems that he's eager to get married.

241
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:56,300
Today, I'm going to take him down.

242
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,300
Wait.

243
00:11:02,300 --> 00:11:04,300
What does the young lady mean?

244
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:06,300
I think the young master is

245
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:08,300
red and has peach blossoms in his eyes.

246
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,300
I think there will be a guest today.

247
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:12,300
How about I treat you to a meal?

248
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,300
Thank you for asking me to give flowers.

249
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,300
You and I met by chance.

250
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,300
No need for dinner.

251
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:20,300
Why are you so polite?

252
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:22,300
You only earn money by eating with me.

253
00:11:22,300 --> 00:11:24,300
Maybe I can help you find someone.

254
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:26,300
Maybe I can help you find someone.

255
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:28,300
You and I just had a few fights.

256
00:11:28,300 --> 00:11:30,300
How do you know I want to find someone?

257
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,300
You and I met by chance.

258
00:11:32,300 --> 00:11:34,300
You have a guard against me.

259
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:36,300
But you heard my mother guarding the plum tree.

260
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:38,300
But you are so kind to me.

261
00:11:38,300 --> 00:11:40,300
You are not in a hurry to go to Guanmei Hall.

262
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,300
But you said you would go in the future.

263
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:44,300
You are not in a hurry to talk to me.

264
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:46,300
But you are also kind to me.

265
00:11:46,300 --> 00:11:48,300
You are not in a hurry to get married.

266
00:11:48,300 --> 00:11:50,300
You are looking for someone to marry.

267
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:52,300
There are many men and women in the whole capital.

268
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:54,300
Those who are not married and those who are married have it.

269
00:11:54,300 --> 00:11:56,300
Brother, you should treat me to a meal.

270
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
You mean the men and women in the whole capital?

271
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:02,300
Of course.

272
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:06,300
In this case,

273
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:08,300
I should treat you to a meal.

274
00:12:08,300 --> 00:12:10,300
How about I treat you to a meal in Xibao Pavilion?

275
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:14,300
Here?

276
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:16,300
Fine.

277
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:18,300
You have done enough homework.

278
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:20,300
You know the banquet is in Xibao Pavilion.

279
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:22,300
Manager Li,

280
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:24,300
I want to have a meal here.

281
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Okay, I will go and prepare it.

282
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:34,300
Does he and the foreigners

283
00:12:34,300 --> 00:12:36,300
know the banquet is in Xibao Pavilion?

284
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:40,300
He doesn't even buy the meal.

285
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,300
So many people.

286
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:48,300
But it's not hard to get

287
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,300
what you usually get.

288
00:12:52,300 --> 00:12:54,300
Let's see how we can get it.

289
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,300
I think we should

290
00:12:58,300 --> 00:13:00,300
know each other better.

291
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:04,300
Poetry and calligraphy.

292
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:06,300
How about calligraphy?

293
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,300
It's not easy to get a wife.

294
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:10,300
How about marriage?

295
00:13:10,300 --> 00:13:12,300
It's not easy to get a wife.

296
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:14,300
Young Master, you are so talented.

297
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:16,300
Wait.

298
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:18,300
I just said it once.

299
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,300
You remember it all?

300
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:24,300
Are all of you so good at talking?

301
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:26,300
You are exaggerating.

302
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:28,300
You know my name.

303
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:30,300
But I don't know who you are.

304
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:32,300
Where are you from?

305
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,300
I am Lu Chi.

306
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:38,300
I am from a high place.

307
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,300
I am not from a high place.

308
00:13:42,300 --> 00:13:44,300
Young Master Lu.

309
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,300
You are so talented

310
00:13:46,300 --> 00:13:48,300
and you know calligraphy.

311
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:50,300
You are the best man in the south.

312
00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:52,300
I wonder who you are looking for.

313
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,300
He is so handsome.

314
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,300
He is so cute.

315
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
It's time to get married.

316
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,300
All the women in the family

317
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:02,300
will be married.

318
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,300
They will know the background of the family

319
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:06,300
and the various situations.

320
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:08,300
It's convenient to choose the right person.

321
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:10,300
Wait. You mean

322
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,300
not only women, men also do this.

323
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,300
In the capital, the rich and the poor get married early.

324
00:14:14,300 --> 00:14:16,300
Ordinary people get married early.

325
00:14:16,300 --> 00:14:18,300
They get married much earlier.

326
00:14:18,300 --> 00:14:20,300
The rich also have an exception, just like me.

327
00:14:20,300 --> 00:14:22,300
I should have made it clear when I got to the top.

328
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,300
But I am going to inherit the family business.

329
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,300
My family loves me very much.

330
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:28,300
They don't want to marry me.

331
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,300
She is also a girl from the rich family.

332
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,300
She has a sweet scent of sweet cake.

333
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:34,300
She has a gold medal of the nobility.

334
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:36,300
I don't know.

335
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:38,300
The rich people remember it clearly.

336
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:40,300
They don't have a deep love.

337
00:14:40,300 --> 00:14:42,300
Forget it.

338
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:44,300
I have to tell her

339
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,300
that she has such a good heart.

340
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,300
Little lady,

341
00:14:48,300 --> 00:14:50,300
what do you mean by smiling?

342
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:52,300
I am helping you to think of a way.

343
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:54,300
How about we eat and

344
00:14:54,300 --> 00:14:56,300
go out for a walk?

345
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,300
If you think it's familiar,

346
00:14:58,300 --> 00:15:00,300
I will choose a good person

347
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:02,300
from the people around you.

348
00:15:02,300 --> 00:15:04,300
I will choose a good-looking,

349
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:06,300
old-fashioned and a good-looking person

350
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:08,300
to take you to see.

351
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:10,300
Great. I will go now.

352
00:15:10,300 --> 00:15:12,300
I...

353
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:16,300
Young Master,

354
00:15:16,300 --> 00:15:18,300
what are you afraid of?

355
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:20,300
I am going to invite Mr. Lu.

356
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:22,300
I will pay for it.

357
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:24,300
And you should prepare a nice dress for him.

358
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,300
I will pay for it.

359
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:28,300
Why can't I

360
00:15:28,300 --> 00:15:30,300
wear a dress?

361
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
It was popular last year.

362
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:34,300
There is an unruly rule in our capital.

363
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:36,300
The first person goes to the doctor's room, the second person goes to the patient's room.

364
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:38,300
I will take you out to see the guest.

365
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,300
The dress should be like this.

366
00:15:40,300 --> 00:15:42,300
You are overreacting.

367
00:15:42,300 --> 00:15:44,300
I...

368
00:15:44,300 --> 00:15:46,300
Young Master, I think you are right.

369
00:15:46,300 --> 00:15:48,300
Why don't you come with me?

370
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,300
You are not a bad person.

371
00:15:54,300 --> 00:15:56,300
I want to see

372
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,300
how much money he brought to the capital.

373
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,300
I will go now.

374
00:16:02,300 --> 00:16:04,300
I will go now.

375
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:28,300
I have never worn a fake paper.

376
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,300
How dare you

377
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:32,300
to put up a good

378
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:34,300
handsome young man in Xibao Pavilion?

379
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,300
You want to pretend to be a rich man?

380
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:38,300
You are so arrogant.

381
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
You dare to criticize my capital's rich man?

382
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:44,300
But,

383
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:46,300
although he is a little bit vain,

384
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:48,300
he is handsome.

385
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,300
He is so worried about his wealth.

386
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,300
He doesn't mind his appearance.

387
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,300
How about I tell him

388
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:56,300
that he is rich and handsome?

389
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:58,300
They will match.

390
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:02,300
What are you doing here?

391
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,300
I am passing by.

392
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:18,300
Are you okay?

393
00:17:18,300 --> 00:17:20,300
Are you okay?

394
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:32,300
I am just drinking.

395
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,300
I feel dizzy.

396
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,300
This smell...

397
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:46,300
Young Mistress, you used incense.

398
00:17:46,300 --> 00:17:48,300
It smells very sweet.

399
00:17:48,300 --> 00:17:50,300
You asked about incense when we met.

400
00:17:50,300 --> 00:17:52,300
You are so naive.

401
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:54,300
I...

402
00:17:54,300 --> 00:17:56,300
Please tell her.

403
00:17:56,300 --> 00:17:58,300
Forget it.

404
00:17:58,300 --> 00:18:00,300
It's okay to tell you.

405
00:18:00,300 --> 00:18:02,300
This is the taste of the cake shop's dessert.

406
00:18:02,300 --> 00:18:04,300
Their dessert is delicious.

407
00:18:04,300 --> 00:18:06,300
If you like this taste,

408
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:08,300
we can buy some for you.

409
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,300
We can find you a good girl.

410
00:18:10,300 --> 00:18:12,300
Great.

411
00:18:12,300 --> 00:18:14,300
Let's go.

412
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,300
Young Mistress,

413
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:20,300
look.

414
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:22,300
Look.

415
00:18:22,300 --> 00:18:24,300
There is a little thing.

416
00:18:24,300 --> 00:18:26,300
Look.

417
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:34,300
Look.

418
00:18:34,300 --> 00:18:36,300
There is a little thing.

419
00:18:36,300 --> 00:18:38,300
Look.

420
00:18:38,300 --> 00:18:40,300
Look.

421
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:42,300
It looks familiar.

422
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:44,300
I have seen this before.

423
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,300
It's a incense stick.

424
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:48,300
It's a incense stick.

425
00:18:58,300 --> 00:19:00,300
Are you hungry?

426
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,300
My father said that

427
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:04,300
if you don't eat, you will lose strength.

428
00:19:04,300 --> 00:19:06,300
Go away.

429
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:08,300
I am not a beggar.

430
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:10,300
I don't need you to try food.

431
00:19:10,300 --> 00:19:12,300
This is a new dish.

432
00:19:12,300 --> 00:19:14,300
It's a new dish.

433
00:19:14,300 --> 00:19:16,300
Brother Lu.

434
00:19:16,300 --> 00:19:18,300
Brother Lu.

435
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,300
Brother Lu.

436
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
Brother Lu.

437
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:24,300
If you are here,

438
00:19:24,300 --> 00:19:26,300
there is a suitable person.

439
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,300
Suitable?

440
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,300
There is a person

441
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:32,300
who has a rich family.

442
00:19:32,300 --> 00:19:34,300
His parents are all

443
00:19:34,300 --> 00:19:36,300
rich people.

444
00:19:36,300 --> 00:19:38,300
He is also rich.

445
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,300
You may want to find a job.

446
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:42,300
I will look for a job.

447
00:19:42,300 --> 00:19:44,300
Let's go to the boss of the bakery first.

448
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,300
Then we can go to the capital to help people.

449
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,300
Let's go.

450
00:20:00,300 --> 00:20:02,300
Brother Xing.

451
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,300
Brother Xing.

452
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:06,300
Ake is here.

453
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:08,300
Wait a minute.

454
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:10,300
I want to go to the east of the city to see the lady of the Wu family.

455
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:12,300
What do you think I should bring?

456
00:20:12,300 --> 00:20:14,300
Miss Wu.

457
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:16,300
Miss Wu.

458
00:20:16,300 --> 00:20:18,300
She likes to eat that sweet and sour candy.

459
00:20:18,300 --> 00:20:20,300
In the middle of the month, her family will come to buy one.

460
00:20:20,300 --> 00:20:22,300
If you want to give it to her,

461
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:24,300
this is it.

462
00:20:24,300 --> 00:20:26,300
This is it.

463
00:20:28,300 --> 00:20:30,300
Okay.

464
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,300
Then this is it. You wrap it up for me.

465
00:20:32,300 --> 00:20:34,300
I'm in a hurry. Hurry up.

466
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:36,300
Brother Lu.

467
00:20:36,300 --> 00:20:38,300
Whatever you like to eat, just pick it.

468
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:40,300
You can have it all.

469
00:20:40,300 --> 00:20:42,300
No.

470
00:20:42,300 --> 00:20:44,300
This is my speciality.

471
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:46,300
This is a speciality that Brother Xian developed.

472
00:20:46,300 --> 00:20:48,300
It's easy for children to grab.

473
00:20:48,300 --> 00:20:50,300
Try it.

474
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:54,300
How is it?

475
00:20:54,300 --> 00:20:56,300
Is it good?

476
00:20:58,300 --> 00:21:00,300
It's delicious.

477
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:04,300
This is for you. It's delicious.

478
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:06,300
It's the same taste as before.

479
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:08,300
I didn't find the right place.

480
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,300
Ake, who is she?

481
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:14,300
She is...

482
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:16,300
Lu Chi.

483
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,300
Young Master He, does the lady of the Wu family also come to this bakery often?

484
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
This is my guest's privacy. Why should I hit you?

485
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,300
I'll hit you.

486
00:21:26,300 --> 00:21:28,300
I used to see his mother bring him here when I was a child.

487
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:30,300
But

488
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:32,300
I don't know why.

489
00:21:32,300 --> 00:21:34,300
I'm not going out anymore. Right, Brother Xian?

490
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,300
Ake,

491
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:38,300
stay away from people with unknown background.

492
00:21:38,300 --> 00:21:40,300
Why are you afraid?

493
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:42,300
My brother is a cashier. My father is the owner of Changhuai's gambling house.

494
00:21:42,300 --> 00:21:44,300
If you don't listen to the guard outside,

495
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
who dares to bully me in the whole capital?

496
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,300
Don't worry.

497
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:50,300
Hurry up. Help me to get the sugar.

498
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:56,300
Oh, right. Brother Xian.

499
00:21:56,300 --> 00:21:58,300
In a few days, I'll be the manager.

500
00:21:58,300 --> 00:22:00,300
You and Tian Tian can come visit me.

501
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:02,300
Don't worry. I've prepared it long ago.

502
00:22:02,300 --> 00:22:04,300
It must be a big gift you've never seen before.

503
00:22:04,300 --> 00:22:06,300
A lucky charm?

504
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:08,300
Yes.

505
00:22:08,300 --> 00:22:10,300
I've invited many famous people to my lucky charm.

506
00:22:10,300 --> 00:22:12,300
I'll meet them at the same time.

507
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:14,300
I'll invite you to come too.

508
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,300
Ake,

509
00:22:16,300 --> 00:22:18,300
okay.

510
00:22:18,300 --> 00:22:20,300
Thank you, Brother Xian. Brother Xian, I have to go.

511
00:22:20,300 --> 00:22:22,300
I'll go first.

512
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:32,300
Brother Lu, wait.

513
00:22:32,300 --> 00:22:34,300
What is it?

514
00:22:34,300 --> 00:22:36,300
I've chosen another one

515
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:38,300
to enter his house.

516
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:40,300
But... What is it?

517
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,300
It's just that I don't know

518
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:44,300
the face of Lady Wu.

519
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:46,300
If she looks like...

520
00:22:46,300 --> 00:22:48,300
I'm just looking for someone.

521
00:22:48,300 --> 00:22:50,300
I don't care about her face.

522
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:52,300
If the guard doesn't want to go in with me,

523
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:54,300
I won't force you.

524
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:56,300
You're so persistent.

525
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,300
I'll go with you.

526
00:22:58,300 --> 00:23:00,300
I'll go with you.

527
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:08,300
In the capital,

528
00:23:08,300 --> 00:23:10,300
without me, the Meiguan Silver Bell,

529
00:23:10,300 --> 00:23:12,300
you'll only be beaten by a woman from a deep house.

530
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,300
I'll do it.

531
00:23:18,300 --> 00:23:20,300
This is a good quality.

532
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,300
I heard it's Wu Qianjin's favorite.

533
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:24,300
Thank you, Meiguan.

534
00:23:24,300 --> 00:23:26,300
This is my lady's favorite walnut flavor.

535
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:30,300
Wu Qianjin likes to eat

536
00:23:30,300 --> 00:23:32,300
sweet and sour.

537
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:34,300
She's so gentle.

538
00:23:34,300 --> 00:23:36,300
This maid is very gentle.

539
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,300
She's got paper bags.

540
00:23:38,300 --> 00:23:40,300
This is walnut flavor.

541
00:23:40,300 --> 00:23:42,300
Wu Qianjin.

542
00:23:42,300 --> 00:23:44,300
This is Mr. Lu Chi Lu.

543
00:23:44,300 --> 00:23:46,300
He looks great.

544
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,300
He even made a good painting.

545
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:50,300
You'll know when you see it.

546
00:23:50,300 --> 00:23:52,300
And,

547
00:23:52,300 --> 00:23:54,300
don't think he's an outsider.

548
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:56,300
I asked around.

549
00:23:56,300 --> 00:23:58,300
There's no one in the family.

550
00:23:58,300 --> 00:24:00,300
I can't.

551
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,300
What's the matter?

552
00:24:02,300 --> 00:24:04,300
Look.

553
00:24:04,300 --> 00:24:06,300
Right?

554
00:24:10,300 --> 00:24:12,300
It's my lady.

555
00:24:12,300 --> 00:24:14,300
The person Wu Qianjin is looking for

556
00:24:14,300 --> 00:24:16,300
is not a good person.

557
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:18,300
I'm afraid I've got the wrong person.

558
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:20,300
I'm afraid I've got the wrong person.

559
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:22,300
I'm leaving.

560
00:24:22,300 --> 00:24:24,300
Wait.

561
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:26,300
It's better to talk to my lady

562
00:24:26,300 --> 00:24:28,300
when the time comes.

563
00:24:28,300 --> 00:24:30,300
You don't have to.

564
00:24:30,300 --> 00:24:32,300
No.

565
00:24:32,300 --> 00:24:34,300
What are you doing?

566
00:24:34,300 --> 00:24:36,300
You're a woman.

567
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:38,300
Talk to her.

568
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:40,300
Meiguan.

569
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,300
Meiguan.

570
00:24:42,300 --> 00:24:44,300
I'm satisfied with your man.

571
00:24:44,300 --> 00:24:46,300
But,

572
00:24:46,300 --> 00:24:48,300
when your lady is not home,

573
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:50,300
can you wait for a while

574
00:24:50,300 --> 00:24:52,300
until she comes back

575
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:54,300
to see you?

576
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,300
This is a blind date?

577
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:58,300
When did I say I wanted to have a blind date?

578
00:24:58,300 --> 00:25:00,300
Don't rush.

579
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,300
Wait until I get it done.

580
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,300
Don't be angry.

581
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:06,300
How about eating a different dish?

582
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:08,300
The fish in my house is the best.

583
00:25:08,300 --> 00:25:10,300
There's no fish at this time.

584
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:12,300
Go away.

585
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:19,400
The

586
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,400
sweet soup is the best

587
00:25:21,400 --> 00:25:23,400
for the sweet soup.

588
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:25,340
The two sisters of He family never

589
00:25:25,340 --> 00:25:27,340
sell more than I do.

590
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:29,340
Some say they eat too much to gain weight,

591
00:25:29,340 --> 00:25:31,340
while others say they eat too much to gain weight.

592
00:25:31,340 --> 00:25:33,340
I think Wu Qianjin is so petty.

593
00:25:33,340 --> 00:25:35,340
So the two sisters of He family

594
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:37,340
are just trying to make fun of me.

595
00:25:37,340 --> 00:25:39,340
They must be making fun of you.

596
00:25:39,340 --> 00:25:41,340
The sweet soup is so delicious,

597
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,340
but they can't be fat.

598
00:25:43,340 --> 00:25:45,340
I don't know whether they're trying to make fun of me.

599
00:25:45,340 --> 00:25:46,340
You and your wife

600
00:25:46,340 --> 00:25:48,260
changed your clothes and changed your identities

601
00:25:48,260 --> 00:25:50,020
to deceive me, right?

602
00:25:51,540 --> 00:25:52,460
Nonsense.

603
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:54,500
Miss Qian,

604
00:25:54,780 --> 00:25:55,980
every time you talk,

605
00:25:56,260 --> 00:25:57,740
you must look at the maid next to you.

606
00:25:58,060 --> 00:25:59,380
It seems that you need her permission

607
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,420
to talk to you.

608
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,820
As the eldest daughter,

609
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:04,220
you call your mother your wife,

610
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:05,380
not your mother.

611
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,740
Look at these hands.

612
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,100
The bones are thick and the skin is rough.

613
00:26:11,340 --> 00:26:12,500
It's impossible to work like this

614
00:26:12,500 --> 00:26:13,500
for more than ten years.

615
00:26:13,980 --> 00:26:14,740
And do you know

616
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,420
there is no fairy in this world?

617
00:26:16,820 --> 00:26:17,820
Look at your hands.

618
00:26:17,940 --> 00:26:18,860
They are thin and tender.

619
00:26:18,940 --> 00:26:20,100
I'm the one who has to tell the truth.

620
00:26:21,220 --> 00:26:21,740
You...

621
00:26:23,380 --> 00:26:23,940
You...

622
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:24,820
What are you?

623
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,140
You are Wu Qian.

624
00:26:26,620 --> 00:26:27,460
Let me tell you.

625
00:26:27,660 --> 00:26:28,860
I'll go back to the hall

626
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,420
and write you all in the dark book.

627
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,340
I'm afraid that no one

628
00:26:31,340 --> 00:26:32,500
will be your match for these years.

629
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:33,340
What should we do, Miss?

630
00:26:33,340 --> 00:26:33,740
No.

631
00:26:33,820 --> 00:26:34,260
No.

632
00:26:34,380 --> 00:26:34,820
Shi Meiguan.

633
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,260
Shi Meiguan.

634
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:35,740
Mr. Luo.

635
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:36,260
Shi Meiguan.

636
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:36,940
Shi Meiguan.

637
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:38,780
How could this happen?

638
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:45,220
Little liar.

639
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:46,740
I'm just looking for someone.

640
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:47,740
But you take me to a blind date.

641
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:48,260
I...

642
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:49,820
Besides,

643
00:26:50,380 --> 00:26:51,220
how is Wu Qianjin

644
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,420
similar to the person I'm looking for?

645
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,420
You said the person you're looking for

646
00:26:53,420 --> 00:26:54,420
is rich and well-mannered.

647
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,260
And he has a round face.

648
00:26:55,740 --> 00:26:56,620
That Wu Qianjin

649
00:26:56,620 --> 00:26:57,420
is not round enough

650
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,500
and not rich enough.

651
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:00,260
As for the blind date,

652
00:27:00,940 --> 00:27:02,580
I'm just praising you.

653
00:27:02,780 --> 00:27:04,500
You're blaming me for his bad intentions.

654
00:27:04,620 --> 00:27:05,620
Then you are round-faced

655
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:06,780
and rich in appearance.

656
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,500
Then you are the person I'm looking for.

657
00:27:09,500 --> 00:27:10,700
You're so unreasonable.

658
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,740
I'm clearly Tao Ziliang, okay?

659
00:27:12,740 --> 00:27:13,580
I think you're just

660
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,660
disliking Wu Qianjin

661
00:27:14,660 --> 00:27:15,820
who is not beautiful enough.

662
00:27:16,340 --> 00:27:17,420
Ridiculous.

663
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,140
Wait.

664
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:22,540
Do you know that

665
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:23,820
the cost of Xibao Pavilion is very high?

666
00:27:24,020 --> 00:27:25,980
Food, drinks, and the Mijia painting.

667
00:27:25,980 --> 00:27:26,620
What about me?

668
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,420
What about you?

669
00:27:29,660 --> 00:27:30,180
Okay.

670
00:27:30,460 --> 00:27:31,740
I won't argue with you about this.

671
00:27:31,940 --> 00:27:33,060
I just want to tell you

672
00:27:33,060 --> 00:27:34,340
that you should be a good person.

673
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:35,740
It's not embarrassing to have no money.

674
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,420
It will only hurt yourself later.

675
00:27:38,460 --> 00:27:40,060
I'm very proud of you.

676
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,660
I'm very proud of you.

677
00:27:43,380 --> 00:27:44,700
I was wrong.

678
00:27:44,860 --> 00:27:45,860
I helped you with kindness.

679
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,220
But you called me a liar.

680
00:27:47,940 --> 00:27:48,460
Fine.

681
00:27:48,940 --> 00:27:50,340
I'll go back to Guanmei Pavilion now

682
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,660
and write you into a blacklist.

683
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:52,660
Then my mother

684
00:27:52,740 --> 00:27:53,980
will be the first beauty in Guanmei Pavilion

685
00:27:53,980 --> 00:27:54,860
and be fair.

686
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,020
Don't think about

687
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,420
going to Guanmei Pavilion again.

688
00:28:06,900 --> 00:28:07,900
Junior, please don't be impulsive.

689
00:28:08,820 --> 00:28:10,820
Is there really a blacklist in Guanmei Pavilion?

690
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,420
Of course.

691
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,380
Junior,

692
00:28:13,740 --> 00:28:15,460
I think you are very kind.

693
00:28:16,740 --> 00:28:17,740
I have something personal

694
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:18,820
to ask you for help.

695
00:28:21,180 --> 00:28:23,580
You look like a painter.

696
00:28:23,660 --> 00:28:25,620
I was just saying something.

697
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,020
Please forgive me.

698
00:28:27,540 --> 00:28:28,940
I don't know how to apologize

699
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:30,180
to make you

700
00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:31,300
change your mind.

701
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:36,780
If you help me

702
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:38,740
draw the picture of Wu Qianjin,

703
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,060
I'll take it back

704
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:42,420
to remind my colleagues to be careful.

705
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:43,700
You can make up for it.

706
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:45,740
I see that for the sake of the painting,

707
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:47,300
I still invite you to my chicken coop.

708
00:28:47,540 --> 00:28:48,980
Then you can see my mother.

709
00:28:49,060 --> 00:28:49,620
Tonight,

710
00:28:49,860 --> 00:28:50,900
the painting will be sent to your house.

711
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:55,780
You don't have much money and a bad temper.

712
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:58,020
Do you know where my house is?

713
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,500
Where is your house?

714
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,260
Take care of your beauty

715
00:29:11,220 --> 00:29:12,460
not the flowers and transplants.

716
00:29:16,780 --> 00:29:17,540
Eunuch Mr. Sun,

717
00:29:18,100 --> 00:29:19,700
according to what I have found out,

718
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:20,860
the dieti,

719
00:29:21,420 --> 00:29:23,860
the Dog W Bhut of Huinshi Game,

720
00:29:24,300 --> 00:29:25,140
although she is pretty,

721
00:29:25,460 --> 00:29:26,900
she spends money easily

722
00:29:27,220 --> 00:29:28,860
and only knows how to roasted.

723
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,540
That's why

724
00:29:30,540 --> 00:29:31,340
she is taking money from the illiterate.

725
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:33,100
Should she be a fine-tulate official

726
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:33,740
in Guanmei Pavilion,

727
00:29:34,700 --> 00:29:35,960
that'd be compares to

728
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:37,960
It's just a matter of time.

729
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,560
But in my opinion,

730
00:29:39,760 --> 00:29:41,360
I think Lady Shi

731
00:29:41,480 --> 00:29:42,840
is just a little more gentle

732
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,320
and naive.

733
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:46,200
But she is smart

734
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,640
and has a sharp tongue.

735
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,320
Lu Yi.

736
00:29:49,600 --> 00:29:50,360
Yes, Your Highness.

737
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:53,400
The Wei Yuan Escort has been robbed

738
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:54,680
by bandits recently.

739
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,520
The talisman is not clear.

740
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,480
Find a way to get in

741
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,480
and investigate.

742
00:29:59,600 --> 00:29:59,960
Yes, Your Highness.

743
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
I'll do it right away.

744
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:04,480
Manager Li.

745
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
Go and buy me

746
00:30:07,120 --> 00:30:07,920
all the houses next to Shi's.

747
00:30:08,440 --> 00:30:09,160
Master.

748
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:11,760
You're not staying in the house this time?

749
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:12,880
I'm going down the mountain this time.

750
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:15,080
What I'm doing

751
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,720
needs the help of the Guanmei Hall.

752
00:30:17,800 --> 00:30:19,440
It's the fastest way to get close to Tao Shoumei.

753
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:20,800
Master.

754
00:30:21,040 --> 00:30:24,240
Lady Shi is good at selling things.

755
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:25,840
But the talisman is

756
00:30:25,960 --> 00:30:27,640
a little slower.

757
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:28,680
That's right.

758
00:30:29,280 --> 00:30:30,680
I'll get close to Tao Shoumei myself.

759
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:32,080
I'm looking for Shi Fak

760
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:34,040
just to find someone.

761
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:36,680
Wait.

762
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,040
Your stuff fell off.

763
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,440
This plate is made of gold.

764
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
My brother said it can buy a lot of money.

765
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,280
I don't want the snake.

766
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,840
How can I use my conscience to get your gold plate?

767
00:30:47,960 --> 00:30:49,560
You actually returned the gold plate to me.

768
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:51,320
This is the pet of my last name.

769
00:30:51,520 --> 00:30:53,240
But I can't afford to return your talisman.

770
00:30:56,600 --> 00:30:58,000
Then come live in my house.

771
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:00,400
We are not friends or enemies.

772
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,760
My brother said Moqi was a teenager.

773
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:03,960
I have a friend.

774
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,400
Moqi was a teenager.

775
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,360
I'll be a sister for ten years.

776
00:31:07,520 --> 00:31:08,600
I'll wait for you.

777
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:10,200
When I'm a sister,

778
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:11,800
you can marry me.

779
00:31:11,920 --> 00:31:12,560
What do you think?

780
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:14,640
I'll give you my body.

781
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:17,200
Thank you for saving my life.

782
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,720
Please wait for me to come back.

783
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:24,800
Shi Yue.

784
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,240
Where are you?

785
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,800
I'm here to make a promise.

786
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,480
Lady.

787
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:37,440
These eyes look so familiar.

788
00:31:40,560 --> 00:31:41,360
Really?

789
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,480
It's impossible.

790
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:45,000
You haven't seen this person.

791
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,800
I dare not speak ill of you.

792
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,880
But it's wise of you to find Shi Fak to help you find him.

793
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,720
Lady Shi is the most beautiful light in the world.

794
00:31:54,920 --> 00:31:57,840
She is very popular among the ladies in the capital.

795
00:31:58,120 --> 00:31:59,000
In a few days,

796
00:31:59,120 --> 00:32:00,760
her auspicious moment will be the best chance.

797
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:01,960
You are wise.

798
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,000
Lady Shi's auspicious moment.

799
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:08,080
Then all the dignitaries in the capital will go to the Dao Hall.

800
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:11,480
You can take this opportunity to meet his mother.

801
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,600
And have a good time.

802
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,440
Shi Fak.

803
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,360
Why do I always think of you?

804
00:32:21,920 --> 00:32:23,280
Mei An. Mei An.

805
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:25,120
Where are you?

806
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:28,360
I think the little brother of the Lu family is useless.

807
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,120
I dare not eat.

808
00:32:31,080 --> 00:32:34,120
I'm afraid that I'll be asked about Mei An's whereabouts.

809
00:32:35,560 --> 00:32:38,600
How about we find a way to introduce him to the colleagues?

810
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:45,160
You can take these paintings to have a good time with the colleagues.

811
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,320
Who?

812
00:32:50,600 --> 00:32:51,960
The paintings of the little brother of the Lu family.

813
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:55,400
I've finished it on time.

814
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:01,680
But you have to answer me first.

815
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,360
Have you ever seen me when I was young?

816
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:16,760
I've seen you?

817
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:22,080
Brother, you're back.

818
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,840
Yes.

819
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:23,520
Oh no.

820
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:24,200
Where is Brother?

821
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:25,320
Brother is back.

822
00:33:26,520 --> 00:33:27,200
Brother.

823
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,080
Brother.

824
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:29,000
Brother.

825
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:29,800
Brother.

826
00:33:30,600 --> 00:33:31,520
Go. Go. Go.

827
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:32,400
Ake.

828
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:33,800
My chicken ceremony is in two days.

829
00:33:33,920 --> 00:33:34,800
We'll talk about it later.

830
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,120
Go.

831
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:36,920
Painting.

832
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:45,840
Ake.

833
00:33:46,720 --> 00:33:47,520
Ake.

834
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,200
Brother. Brother.

835
00:33:51,880 --> 00:33:52,760
Brother. Brother.

836
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,840
What are you doing?

837
00:33:55,880 --> 00:33:56,920
I'm suddenly a little sleepy.

838
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:58,040
I'll go back to sleep.

839
00:34:00,320 --> 00:34:01,000
This...

840
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:03,840
Ake looks a little nervous.

841
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,520
Tang Jie.

842
00:34:07,640 --> 00:34:08,640
Get up.

843
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:09,920
Get up.

844
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,600
We can't be late for the ceremony today.

845
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:13,480
I know.

846
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,120
Whose portrait is this?

847
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:19,120
Don't move.

848
00:34:20,280 --> 00:34:20,920
Don't move.

849
00:34:21,200 --> 00:34:21,840
Give it to me.

850
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:23,920
This is the portrait of the fifth young lady.

851
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,080
It's useful to me.

852
00:34:26,920 --> 00:34:27,720
But look.

853
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:31,120
Does this brush look like...

854
00:34:31,520 --> 00:34:32,360
Like who?

855
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,760
Like Mr. Lin Yuan.

856
00:34:34,520 --> 00:34:37,280
But it's more delicate than Mr. Lin Yuan's brush.

857
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:40,600
It seems that Brother Lu is a talent.

858
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,320
He still can't let go of this easily.

859
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,520
The girl of Mr. Li's family

860
00:34:46,640 --> 00:34:48,000
gave it to Mr. Lin.

861
00:34:48,560 --> 00:34:49,480
That's great.

862
00:34:58,160 --> 00:34:58,960
Sit down.

863
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:05,960
Officers.

864
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,640
What's the matter today?

865
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,240
Chief Guard Tao.

866
00:35:10,760 --> 00:35:12,040
The Wu Family has reported that

867
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,360
Shi Fakke broke into his house

868
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,760
with a stranger.

869
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:18,720
And he even insulted his daughter.

870
00:35:19,160 --> 00:35:22,200
I hope you can punish Shi Fakke.

871
00:35:24,760 --> 00:35:26,160
When I find out the truth,

872
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:28,200
I will punish him severely.

873
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:42,680
AquÃ©, you finally came.

874
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,120
The Wu Family has complained to you.

875
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:45,920
Uncomfortable.

876
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,880
You dared to tell the tin first.

877
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:49,000
Turtledoer?

878
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:52,080
Young Miss.

879
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,240
Please pay them with your life,

880
00:35:54,440 --> 00:35:55,360
and I will send money

881
00:35:55,360 --> 00:35:56,360
I'm not.

882
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,440
I'm doing this for the Wu Family's investment.

883
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,880
Please listen to me.

884
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:07,680
Look,

885
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:09,800
I went to tell the Wu Family about our marriage.

886
00:36:10,520 --> 00:36:12,120
How did I know that the Wu Family's daughter

887
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:14,440
and the beauty maid were pretending to be a fool?

888
00:36:14,920 --> 00:36:15,920
So,

889
00:36:15,920 --> 00:36:18,320
I brought you the painting of Wu Qianjin.

890
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:20,880
When you go to tell the Wu Family about our marriage,

891
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,560
you must be careful.

892
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:25,200
Don't be the accomplice of the fraud.

893
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:27,460
Shall we sit down?

894
00:36:28,080 --> 00:36:29,140
Chicken cool down?

895
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:29,900
No.

896
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:33,000
Someone has offered to call a taxi for someone or Krsna for Orang Chrome.

897
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,280
So I'd like a new ride.

898
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,240
Now the job is date,

899
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:42,920
or the page will fill with dress.

900
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:44,320
You did a great job.

901
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:49,320
Since you've been to many families,

902
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:52,720
do you feel upset about this month'sæ¼äº® girl case?

903
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,080
your performance today.

904
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,300
Do me the Ellech occurs?

905
00:36:55,480 --> 00:36:56,280
Shi Fak.

906
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:56,960
Everyone has to be flickering

907
00:36:58,060 --> 00:36:59,180
through not taking care of their business.

908
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:00,800
Just last month,

909
00:37:00,800 --> 00:37:01,520
you only prepared

910
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,180
one beautiful result.

911
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,400
With one smack less this month,

912
00:37:04,400 --> 00:37:05,360
your pocket money

913
00:37:05,360 --> 00:37:06,160
you won't be able to afford.

914
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,080
Mom,

915
00:37:08,660 --> 00:37:10,400
I am your daughter.

916
00:37:17,600 --> 00:37:18,520
Today,

917
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,700
the imperial governor urged me

918
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:21,760
to cancel the engagement,

919
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,760
I'm just trying to urge you.

920
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,280
When can I drink the wedding wine of Grand Tutor?

921
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:31,360
Marquis, this Tao Shoumei is so stubborn.

922
00:37:31,360 --> 00:37:32,880
He didn't do it.

923
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:34,280
Bastard!

924
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:37,560
You can't even do such a small thing?

925
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:42,680
Marquis, please don't be angry. I will definitely do it this time.

926
00:37:42,680 --> 00:37:45,640
Let me ask you again. Is that person safe recently?

927
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:49,040
That person, besides going to court, is always drawing and drawing.

928
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:53,800
He even secretly sent the painting out of the palace and then sold it at a high bid.

929
00:37:53,800 --> 00:37:56,040
I already sent someone to investigate.

930
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:59,840
That painting was just bought by a woman who is a shopkeeper.

931
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:03,840
The painting is just a normal couple.

932
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:23,240
Brother, why are you still awake so late?

933
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:27,640
I was preparing a special gift for A'ke.

934
00:38:27,640 --> 00:38:28,640
I'm going to sleep now.

935
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,640
Tomorrow, there will be a lot of guests.

936
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:33,040
You must prepare the dishes well.

937
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:36,840
I can buy any valuable gift for him.

938
00:38:36,840 --> 00:38:39,440
But the dessert I made, I definitely can't buy it.

939
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,840
That's right.

940
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,440
You finally waited for him to get excited.

941
00:38:43,440 --> 00:38:46,640
Tomorrow, I will buy you a cake.

942
00:38:46,640 --> 00:38:48,440
You are too impatient.

943
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:52,840
Tomorrow, you can tell him your thoughts.

944
00:38:53,840 --> 00:38:56,640
Okay. If you want to get up early tomorrow, I will go rest first.

945
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,840
Brother, you also go to sleep early.

946
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:06,240
The peach tree is blooming, the flowers are blooming.

947
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:10,240
The son is returning, the wife is leaving.

948
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,240
The last day of the fifth month,

949
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:21,840
since it's all about my chicken and chicken,

950
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:24,240
I really don't have much money.

951
00:39:24,240 --> 00:39:28,240
And the painting of Mr. Yuan was also stolen by Tian Tian.

952
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:31,840
I wonder if Sister Pan'er has any stock to sell,

953
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:34,240
so that she can earn some pocket money.

954
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:41,440
Sister Tang, why are you so late?

955
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:43,440
I'm already late.

956
00:39:44,240 --> 00:39:47,840
Oh, Sister Tang, why are you still not wearing your shoes?

957
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,640
There are guests who are giving gifts everywhere.

958
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:52,640
Auntie wants you to go to the county to give gifts.

959
00:39:53,640 --> 00:39:56,240
What's the rush? Isn't my mother outside?

960
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:59,240
Moreover, they want to tell my mother

961
00:39:59,240 --> 00:40:01,440
more about their children's situation.

962
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:03,040
Sister Tang, please hurry up.

963
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,640
This is a good time to earn a lot of fame.

964
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,840
After the chicken, you are going to have a blind date.

965
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:13,240
I'm not going to have a blind date. I'm going to wait for him.

966
00:40:13,240 --> 00:40:14,840
Who?

967
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:18,440
You don't need to know.

968
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:21,840
But I'm afraid that he's here.

969
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:25,240
Time has passed for too long. I can't recognize him.

970
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,840
So I must get the patient's gold medal

971
00:40:27,840 --> 00:40:29,840
so that I can recognize him.

972
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:37,840
I hope that when my little sister is in a critical situation,

973
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:39,840
everyone will also congratulate her.

974
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,840
May she be safe and happy.

975
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,840
Everyone, the bride is here.

976
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,840
So pretty.

977
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:53,840
Ah Ke, you are so pretty today.

978
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:55,240
Good luck to all the sisters.

979
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:57,840
Thank you sisters for coming to my sister's wedding.

980
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,240
Ah Ke, my grandfather is busy today.

981
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,040
He especially asked me to come and congratulate you.

982
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:03,840
I even prepared a gift for you.

983
00:41:03,840 --> 00:41:05,240
Come.

984
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:06,640
Here.

985
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,640
Here.

986
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:16,640
This is the limited edition drawing book of the next mountain.

987
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,240
You can't even buy it with money. I'm so envious.

988
00:41:19,240 --> 00:41:23,240
Ah Ke, I'm only begging you not to use my pen to write the script.

989
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,440
Don't worry.

990
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:27,640
Even if I add a second one, I won't trouble you.

991
00:41:27,640 --> 00:41:30,440
Okay, it's a deal.

992
00:41:30,440 --> 00:41:33,640
I already said that he will give his gift to you.

993
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,440
Here. I gave this to you.

994
00:41:37,240 --> 00:41:39,240
What is it?

995
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:47,440
Tiantian, this is Mr. Ling Yue's limited edition drawing book.

996
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:49,240
That person insisted on stealing it from me.

997
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:51,640
So it was a gift for me.

998
00:41:51,640 --> 00:41:55,040
It's all your fault. I've already spent a lot of money.

999
00:41:55,040 --> 00:41:57,440
Tiantian, I knew you were the best.

1000
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:00,240
I'll let you be the daughter of the Golden Thread Embroidery for the rest of your life.

1001
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:01,440
Vice President.

1002
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:05,640
Stop it. If it wasn't for the golden rain, I would have hit you.

1003
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:09,040
The new old house, Manager Li is here.

1004
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:10,440
Manager Li is here.

1005
00:42:10,440 --> 00:42:13,640
Sister Pan'er, congratulations on your arrival.

1006
00:42:13,640 --> 00:42:16,440
Sister Pan'er, thank you for coming.

1007
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,240
I'm very happy today.

1008
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:22,040
This is a gift from our owner.

1009
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:25,440
What is this?

1010
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:27,840
What is this?

1011
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:31,440
From now on, no matter what you buy in my house,

1012
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,040
you can enjoy all kinds of food.

1013
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:35,240
You can enjoy a 90% discount.

1014
00:42:35,240 --> 00:42:39,640
And all tea and drinks are free.

1015
00:42:39,640 --> 00:42:42,440
Also, all the businessmen in Xibao Pavilion

1016
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:46,640
can pay the bill without interest and without a deadline.

1017
00:42:46,640 --> 00:42:50,640
Thank you, Sister Pan'er. I'll thank you again.

1018
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:52,640
Congratulations, Boss Shi.

1019
00:42:52,640 --> 00:42:55,040
Congratulations.

1020
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:57,440
Mr. Zheng, you are my superior.

1021
00:42:57,440 --> 00:42:59,840
You came personally to do such a small thing.

1022
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,640
Boss Shi, you're too courteous.

1023
00:43:01,640 --> 00:43:05,240
Ake is the only heir of the most beautiful woman in the world.

1024
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:07,440
He will be promoted to the official media.

1025
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,040
Besides, I have five daughters.

1026
00:43:10,040 --> 00:43:12,240
How can I not come?

1027
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:13,440
Thank you for your words.

1028
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:16,840
I will become the most beautiful woman in the world.

1029
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:18,640
I must become one.

1030
00:43:18,640 --> 00:43:20,440
You must be a good wife.

1031
00:43:20,440 --> 00:43:21,240
Be careful, Madam.

1032
00:43:21,240 --> 00:43:22,840
Okay.

1033
00:43:22,840 --> 00:43:25,440
Please.

1034
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:26,440
Uncle Shi.

1035
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:27,640
Mr. Xu, Mrs. Xu.

1036
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:29,840
We are here to say hello to Ake.

1037
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:31,640
We are here to say hello to Ake.

1038
00:43:31,640 --> 00:43:32,640
You're welcome.

1039
00:43:32,640 --> 00:43:34,640
Come in, please.

1040
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:35,440
Come in.

1041
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:38,840
Brother, why did you come personally?

1042
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:41,640
The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Prefectural Affairs is here.

1043
00:43:41,640 --> 00:43:44,440
They are either the ones my mother gave to Bao Luo Mei

1044
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:48,240
or the ones who are unmarried and have to depend on their mother.

1045
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:51,640
But after the ceremony, Ake has a family.

1046
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,440
What did you say?

1047
00:43:52,440 --> 00:43:53,640
What did you say?

1048
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:57,440
No one in this world can be compared to my daughter.

1049
00:43:57,440 --> 00:44:00,240
Yes, father is right.

1050
00:44:02,440 --> 00:44:05,640
Three of you, the Deputy Director of the Bureau of Prefectural Affairs wants me to attend the ceremony.

1051
00:44:05,640 --> 00:44:06,840
Who are you?

1052
00:44:06,840 --> 00:44:08,240
Where are you from?

1053
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,440
What is your relationship with my sister?

1054
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:14,240
I am a new neighbor who just arrived today.

1055
00:44:14,240 --> 00:44:15,440
My name is Lu Ming Chi.

1056
00:44:15,440 --> 00:44:18,640
The Deputy Director of the Bureau of Prefectural Affairs has taken me to visit him before.

1057
00:44:21,840 --> 00:44:25,040
This guy is too bad looking. I have to be careful.

1058
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,840
It's so weird to have another neighbor.

1059
00:44:26,840 --> 00:44:28,440
I can't help it.

1060
00:44:29,440 --> 00:44:30,640
Let me teach you.

1061
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:33,240
You are the owner of this restaurant.

1062
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:33,640
Welcome.

1063
00:44:33,640 --> 00:44:36,640
Look, I brought you something.

1064
00:44:42,640 --> 00:44:44,040
Ake, I hope you...

1065
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:47,440
Brother, your cooking skills are still so good.

1066
00:44:49,240 --> 00:44:51,440
Ake, I hope you will...

1067
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,040
I know.

1068
00:44:53,040 --> 00:44:57,640
Every year, every month, every day, every moment, every moment, you are happy, right?

1069
00:44:58,840 --> 00:45:01,040
And my company.

1070
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,040
Not only you, but also Tiantian.

1071
00:45:05,040 --> 00:45:08,040
I am going to give this pig to Tiantian.

1072
00:45:08,040 --> 00:45:11,240
The rest will be given to all the sisters.

1073
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,440
Ake, look.

1074
00:45:14,440 --> 00:45:16,440
You are also a sister.

1075
00:45:16,440 --> 00:45:18,440
It's time to say goodbye.

1076
00:45:19,440 --> 00:45:24,040
Brother Xian, you should know that I am the world's number one heir.

1077
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,240
I am still a career. How can I be married?

1078
00:45:27,240 --> 00:45:32,440
Besides, my mother taught me how to make money.

1079
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:35,240
I just agreed to marry a beggar.

1080
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:38,640
Brother Xian, you don't know it well.

1081
00:45:40,440 --> 00:45:42,840
It's too hot. My makeup is ruined.

1082
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:45,040
Brother Xian, go to the front hall and wait for me.

1083
00:45:45,040 --> 00:45:46,640
I need to do my makeup.

1084
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,440
If my mother sees me like this, she will scold me to death.

1085
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,440
Okay. I will wait for you in the front hall.

1086
00:46:17,640 --> 00:46:19,840
The wedding ceremony is about to start.

1087
00:46:19,840 --> 00:46:22,240
I am afraid that it will be too late.

1088
00:46:23,840 --> 00:46:25,240
You...

1089
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:27,840
Zhen'er.

1090
00:46:29,840 --> 00:46:31,840
I am sorry for what I said.

1091
00:46:31,840 --> 00:46:33,440
If you go to the wedding ceremony like this,

1092
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:35,440
I am afraid that you will have to wear a big face.

1093
00:46:36,240 --> 00:46:39,040
It's over. Where is Xingzi?

1094
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:23,440
I know this meeting is the grace of fate

1095
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:30,240
Every time I see you, I only have a lovely stubbornness

1096
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:37,440
Although I can't remember every single problem

1097
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:42,440
I can't forget your smile

1098
00:47:42,640 --> 00:47:48,640
Although I can't remember every single difficult day

1099
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:56,640
I can't forget the first time I saw you

1100
00:47:56,640 --> 00:48:01,240
Even if this love is heartless, silent, and nightless

1101
00:48:01,240 --> 00:48:03,240
It doesn't matter if it's a stormy month

1102
00:48:03,240 --> 00:48:08,040
As long as you are never afraid, never shy, and never worried

1103
00:48:08,040 --> 00:48:11,240
I will enjoy this moment

1104
00:48:11,240 --> 00:48:14,240
No matter in this world or in the next

1105
00:48:14,240 --> 00:48:18,240
Whether there will be any border

1106
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:24,240
I am willing to protect you with my life

1107
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:29,240
Even if I can't love you as I love you

1108
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:34,240
I will be by your side in this life

1109
00:48:34,440 --> 00:48:38,440
I will be by your side in this life

1110
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:41,440
Even if the world is wide open

1111
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:45,440
I will never forget the past

1112
00:48:45,440 --> 00:48:51,440
Please remember the youth that you once had

1113
00:48:51,440 --> 00:49:00,440
From now on, I am unwilling to part with you
