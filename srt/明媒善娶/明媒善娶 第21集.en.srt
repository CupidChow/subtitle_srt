3
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:44,400
Tell me quickly,

4
00:01:44,539 --> 00:01:46,440
am I about to have a senior sister-in-law?

5
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:48,330
Alright, let's not talk about this now.

6
00:01:48,330 --> 00:01:50,990
I heard you've been
frequently leaving the palace lately.

7
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:53,050
Has Marquis Wu'an made any new moves?

8
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,600
No.

9
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:01,190
I met an interesting person.

10
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,200
It must be a young lady.

11
00:02:05,410 --> 00:02:06,400
Chi.

12
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,039
It seems

13
00:02:08,509 --> 00:02:11,530
we don't know
whose wedding we'll be celebrating first.

14
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,620
That's not right.

15

Things aren't moving
that quickly between us.

Today is the last day
of the art exhibition.

18

After today,

19
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:34,200
where else can I find Mr. Lin Yuan?

20
00:02:38,810 --> 00:02:39,660
Pack up the paintings

00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:41,350
and return them
to Mr. Lin Yuan's residence.

Hello.

Are you the person in charge?

27
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:52,700
Would it be possible
for me to meet Mr. Lin Yuan?

28
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,760
My master keeps a low profile

29
00:02:55,790 --> 00:02:56,980
and doesn't like meeting strangers.

30
00:02:56,980 --> 00:02:58,380
Miss, please go back home.

31
00:02:58,380 --> 00:02:59,400
Please, I beg you.

34
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:03,230
just to see him once.

35

If I can't see him today,

36
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:08,270
I won't leave.

37

Sir, I can testify

38
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:15,020
that this Miss truly comes here every day.

39
00:03:17,290 --> 00:03:19,690
It seems you genuinely likes our master.

40
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:23,170
I'll make an exception this time.

There's a Miss who insists on seeing you.

How could you bring
someone here without permission?

You know I never receive visitors.

Please don't blame your steward, Sir.

sometimes you were
with joy and excitement,

63
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,710
sometimes with melancholy.

64
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:30,750
You must be someone
who truly understands me,

feel what I feel, think what I think.

You asked
the exact same questions as I did.

This Mr. Lin Yuan is an impostor.

Miss Yan has definitely been deceived.

129
00:07:26,820 --> 00:07:28,330
You must stop her
from rushing into marriage,

I have something to discuss with you.

136
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:52,200
Mr. Lin Yuan keeps a very low profile,

137
00:07:52,390 --> 00:07:54,940
and Xibao Pavilion
has been selling his paintings for years.

138
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:57,260
All these years, no one has ever seen him,

139
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:59,380
nor has he ever held an art exhibition.

140
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:01,810
Now he suddenly
wants to hold an exhibition

141
00:08:01,890 --> 00:08:03,350
and is willing to meet you.

142
00:08:03,570 --> 00:08:05,700
There are too many coincidences here.

143
00:08:05,800 --> 00:08:07,320
Something's not right about this,

144
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,650
you have to reconsider.

145
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:10,800
Ke, you're overthinking this.

146
00:08:11,290 --> 00:08:13,850
Isn't this exactly what you call fate?

147
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:15,830
I'm a matchmaker,

148
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,640
so of course I believe in fate.

149
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,490
But Lu is convinced

150
00:08:19,510 --> 00:08:21,200
that he's a fake Mr. Lin Yuan.

151
00:08:21,220 --> 00:08:23,650
Ke, say no more.

152
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:27,560
Qiyue, you shouldn't dismiss what Lu says.

153
00:08:27,580 --> 00:08:28,390
Ke,

154
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:30,140
he's the one you care about,

155
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,910
so it's understandable that you trust him.

156
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:33,360
But I have my own feelings,

157
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,820
and I have someone I care about too.

158
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:36,470
Mr. Lin Yuan and I
are already connected by fate.

159
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:37,270
That's a fact.

160
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,409
Do you know his real name?

161
00:08:40,429 --> 00:08:41,360
Where is he from?

162
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:42,230
What family members...

163
00:08:42,230 --> 00:08:42,919
Ke.

164
00:08:44,010 --> 00:08:46,110
Before, I thought Mr. Lin Yuan was Lu Chi,

165
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,920
and I could understand when you said no.

166
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:49,860
But now I've found the real Mr. Lin Yuan,

167
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:50,840
and you're still saying no.

168
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:51,820
What exactly do you want from me?

169
00:08:51,820 --> 00:08:53,300
Of course I want what's best for you.

170
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:53,730
No.

171

506
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:04,150
Qiyue, one day, you'll meet someone
who truly loves you as you love them,

507
00:27:04,150 --> 00:27:05,880
and spend a lifetime together.

508
00:27:06,290 --> 00:27:07,000
Really?

509
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:10,220
Will fate arrange such a person for me?

510
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:11,860
This can't be left to fate,

511
00:27:11,890 --> 00:27:13,260
and certainly not to Mr. Lin Yuan.

512
00:27:13,260 --> 00:27:14,500
Then I can leave it to you, right?

513
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:15,330
No.

514
00:27:17,670 --> 00:27:18,730
This matter

515

can only be entrusted to your own heart.

516

I'm not angry anymore.

It's that Shi Fa'ke again!

524

I was just one step away

535

I want to destroy his power outside

536

and his wings.

537
00:28:08,330 --> 00:28:11,440
I will kill those

who oppose me.

539

My Lord, you're heaven's chosen one,

you will surely be invincible
and achieve swift victory!

541

Qiyue, this play today is really good.

542

After you watch it,

you'll definitely forget
all your troubles.

544

I hope so.

545

546

just the two of you is no fun.

Why don't...

00:28:34,730 --> 00:28:35,520
That's right.

Why don't we join you?

-Where are you going?
-Let me tell you.

551
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,620
My eldest brother is a constable.

So don't try anything.

-We just want to make friends with you.
-Yeah. Since when is that against the law?

But why didn't you leave?

Thank you for your help
just now, Mr. Huang.

I'm flattered, Miss Shi.

579

It was nothing worth mentioning.

Let's not talk about that.

Let's chat about something more pleasant.

You don't come
to this theater often, do you?

Mr. Huang,

Are you from the capital?

Where are you staying now?

601
00:30:44,140 --> 00:30:46,470
I'm temporarily staying at Qingfeng Inn.

602
00:30:47,310 --> 00:30:49,360
So you're not from the capital.

603
00:30:49,680 --> 00:30:52,200
Then, Mr. Huang, where is your hometown?

607
00:31:03,870 --> 00:31:05,940
Mr. Huang, what a coincidence,

Have another piece.

This one is delicious too, try it.

615
00:31:26,970 --> 00:31:28,630
Judging by Qiyue's reaction,

616
00:31:29,160 --> 00:31:31,870
she seems to have
special feelings for Mr. Huang.

00:34:38,530 --> 00:34:40,389
That wouldn't be good for anyone.

I'm unhappy when I don't see him.

But

679
00:34:48,310 --> 00:34:49,929
if I'm supposed to give up Mr. Lin Yuan,

680
00:34:49,929 --> 00:34:51,060
I can't accept that.

681
00:34:51,190 --> 00:34:52,440
I'm so confused,

682
00:34:52,730 --> 00:34:54,929
I don't know what my heart really wants.

683
00:34:58,450 --> 00:34:59,220
It's okay.

684
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,560
Just give me a few more days,

I'll definitely find a way

691
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:37,120
Yes, I understand.

692
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,050
Qiyue, look at these paintings

693
00:35:44,070 --> 00:35:45,870
and see if any are by Mr. Lin Yuan?

694
00:35:46,530 --> 00:35:47,500
Not again.

695
00:35:47,530 --> 00:35:48,560

and you're trying
to fool me with this trick again.

I promise I'm not joking.

Look.

Even if there really is an authentic work
by Mr. Lin Yuan in there,

705
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,480
you still wouldn't be able to identify it.

706
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:32,040
Am I truly not destined
to connect with Mr. Lin Yuan?

707
00:36:37,050 --> 00:36:37,700
Come here.

708

709

There are five young men here.

The enemy forces greatly outnumber ours.

Our recent engagements with them

816
00:42:09,270 --> 00:42:10,700
have resulted in heavy casualties.

a stubborn and brutal man.

822
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:26,310
At least you've engaged with them

823
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:27,840
and learned about their situation,

824
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:30,190
which will be very beneficial
for our future battles.

825

They've sent their elite troops

826

to cut off the capital's retreat route.

we'll make sure they never return,

Our forces are outnumbered,

would surely lead to defeat,

so we must use
Mount Qianya's terrain to our advantage.

Send out the order:

837

immediately send men
down the mountain with great fanfare,

838

buying and stockpiling provisions,

00:42:56,050 --> 00:42:58,660
carrying war drums
and banners, shouting loudly,

840
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:01,280
making the enemy believe
we have many troops and ample supplies.

841
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,390
Before their supplies arrive,

842
00:43:02,390 --> 00:43:04,050
they won't dare to make any rash moves.

843
00:43:04,050 --> 00:43:05,200
Once their supplies arrive,

844
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:07,400
we'll engage them in a war of attrition,

845
00:43:07,710 --> 00:43:10,510
even if we can't defeat them,
we'll wear them down.

846
00:43:11,830 --> 00:43:13,040
But I'm worried

847
00:43:13,070 --> 00:43:14,220
that if this drags on too long,

848
00:43:14,220 --> 00:43:15,760
we might not be able to hold out.

849
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:16,540
Don't worry,

850
00:43:16,570 --> 00:43:18,510
we certainly won't
just sit and wait for death.

851
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:19,260
Zhuxi,

852
00:43:20,150 --> 00:43:21,640
I have a plan now

853
00:43:22,270 --> 00:43:25,010
that will dampen their spirits.
