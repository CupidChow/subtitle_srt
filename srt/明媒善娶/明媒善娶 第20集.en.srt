you've always been rough,

Xianxian, let me tell you.

23
00:02:25,850 --> 00:02:28,590
A true man should be strong and dependable

It's truly eye-opening.

Mr. Lin Yuan's painting style is free,

Perhaps this is Mr. Lin Yuan's intentionâ€”

114
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,800
he hopes his works don't simply end up

His spirit is as high as mountains

When Mr. Lin Yuan paints,

122
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,700
he avoids dragging the brush.

123
00:06:20,930 --> 00:06:23,010
He believes
dragging dulls the stroke's power,

124
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:24,640
makes the work feel restless,

125
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,440
and disturbs the viewer's mood.

126
00:06:27,180 --> 00:06:28,010
Mr. Lu

127
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:30,980

Mr. Lin Yuan's thoughts so well.

Mr. Lu,

129
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:37,450
are you also skilled
in calligraphy and painting?

of seeing your work?

132
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:49,110
I just completed a piece earlier today.

133
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:52,930
Ke, Mr. Yan, I'd be honored
if you could offer your insights.

134

Then lead the way, Lu.

135
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:07,070
The handwriting... looks so familiar.

136
00:07:07,630 --> 00:07:08,420
Mr. Lu,

137
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:11,190
is this the painting you just finished?

138
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,820
Yes.

139
00:07:24,760 --> 00:07:25,580
Ke.

140
00:07:25,750 --> 00:07:28,210
This is clearly
Mr. Lin Yuan's handwriting.

141
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:30,750
Impossible. Lu painted this.

142
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:33,260
The handwriting may look similar,

143
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:35,560
but there are still differences.

144
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,710
And this is better than Mr. Lin Yuan's.

145
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:42,290
Mr. Lu,

146
00:07:42,810 --> 00:07:44,340
you're Mr. Lin Yuan, right?

147
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,090
No.

148
00:07:51,330 --> 00:07:53,130
What makes you say that, Mr. Yan?

149
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,730
The handwriting in this painting

150
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,040
is identical

151
00:07:56,070 --> 00:07:57,350
to Mr. Lin Yuan's.

152
00:07:57,390 --> 00:07:58,900
I couldn't possibly be mistaken.

153
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:00,360
You are mistaken, Mr. Yan.

154
00:08:00,700 --> 00:08:02,140
I am not Mr. Lin Yuan,

155
00:08:02,890 --> 00:08:04,190
nor do I know him.

156
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:09,180
How could Lu be Mr. Lin Yuan?

157
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:13,980
Lu,

158
00:08:14,300 --> 00:08:16,170
are you really not Mr. Lin Yuan?

159
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:16,870
Ke,

160
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,890
I am certainly not Mr. Lin Yuan.

161
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,150
Do you remember when we first met,

162
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:23,190
you were with me admiring

163
00:08:23,190 --> 00:08:24,650
Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings?

164
00:08:28,350 --> 00:08:29,260
Mr. Yan,

165
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,670
Lu said he's not Mr. Lin Yuan.

166
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:33,220
So he definitely isn't Mr. Lin Yuan.

167
00:08:33,220 --> 00:08:35,650
Lu and I will help you find him.

168
00:08:36,010 --> 00:08:37,340
You won't be able to find him.

169
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,740
Don't waste your energy.

170
00:08:39,429 --> 00:08:41,690
How could we not find someone who exists?

Unless you are Mr. Lin Yuan.

173
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:44,580
I'm not.

174
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:50,770
Why do you insist on finding Mr. Lin Yuan?

175
00:08:50,910 --> 00:08:52,440
Because I want to marry him.

176

So I had to reveal my identity.

Qiyue,

196
00:10:11,690 --> 00:10:12,470
do you really think

197
00:10:12,470 --> 00:10:14,010
Lu is Mr. Lin Yuan?

198
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:20,970
I believe he is.

199

Qiyue, you think Lu is Mr. Lin Yuan

just because of one painting.

201

Isn't that too hasty?

202
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:29,290
Besides, for a master like Mr. Lin Yuan,

203

there're plenty of people
who copy his style.

Now that he knows,

you should give him a chance to choose,

222

00:16:56,740 --> 00:16:58,150
None of these five paintings

341
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,310
is an authentic work by Mr. Lin Yuan.

342
00:17:00,340 --> 00:17:01,400
I don't believe it.

of the Jiawu year]

If you don't believe me,

345
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:06,810
take a look at this.

[Painted in the Wuchen month
of the Jiawu year]

347
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,420
Lu is so impressive.

348
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:16,190
He painted this himself,

349
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,190
yet Qiyue can't tell at all.

350
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,319
How could this be?

351
00:17:24,040 --> 00:17:24,800
Qiyue,

352
00:17:25,569 --> 00:17:27,310
you say you love Mr. Lin Yuan,

353
00:17:27,710 --> 00:17:29,990
but you can't even tell

354
00:17:30,010 --> 00:17:31,150
if these are originals or imitations.

355
00:17:31,150 --> 00:17:32,370
I don't know why

356
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:33,830
you're showing me these imitations

357
00:17:33,830 --> 00:17:34,740
today.

358
00:17:35,000 --> 00:17:36,200
If you're trying to deny

359
00:17:36,200 --> 00:17:38,130
my feelings for Mr. Lin Yuan this way,

360
00:17:38,130 --> 00:17:39,160
that's not fair.

361
00:17:39,350 --> 00:17:40,090
Qiyue,

362
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:42,640
paintings can be similar.

363
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:43,800
But your ideal match

364
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:45,170
should be one of a kind.

365
00:17:45,910 --> 00:17:46,970
The person you love

366
00:17:47,070 --> 00:17:48,480
should be genuine,

367
00:17:48,510 --> 00:17:50,040
not just a celebrated name.

368
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:53,250
If you want to marry someone

369
00:17:53,270 --> 00:17:54,230
just because you like his paintings,

370
00:17:54,230 --> 00:17:55,430
that's not rational.

371
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,610
What if he's not like what you imagine?

372
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:06,180
Are you sure
you love Mr. Lin Yuan himself,

373
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,930
not the version you've imagined?

374
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:14,940
Qiyue,

375
00:18:15,770 --> 00:18:17,740
you've seen Lu many times,

376
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,000
but you've never had
any special feelings for him.

377
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:22,210
Do you really think

378
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,140
he's the same as the Mr. Lin Yuan

379
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:25,140
you've imagined?

380
00:18:25,270 --> 00:18:27,820
Do you truly want to marry Lu Chi?

381
00:18:33,820 --> 00:18:36,970
Indeed, I don't have any feelings for him.

382
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,960
But when you found out
he was Mr. Lin Yuan,

383
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,820
you said you wanted to marry Mr. Lin Yuan,

384
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:43,050
not Lu Chi.

385
00:18:43,070 --> 00:18:45,540
Exactly, I want to marry Mr. Lin Yuan.

386
00:18:45,660 --> 00:18:47,150
You don't even know this person.

387
00:18:47,150 --> 00:18:48,740
And you've never spent time with him.

388
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:50,570
How can you be sure he's the one you love

389
00:18:50,570 --> 00:18:51,640
or want to marry?

390
00:18:53,300 --> 00:18:56,460
Do you plan to spend your life

391
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:58,360
with his paintings and his name?

392
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:05,460
Ke, what you said makes sense.

393
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,780
Perhaps I really should think

394
00:19:08,130 --> 00:19:09,690
about what I truly want.

395
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:13,280
It's okay.

396
00:19:13,950 --> 00:19:15,480
Don't rush, take your time.

397
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,350
I promised you

398
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,610
I'd help you find a good match.

399

there are hidden undercurrents.

842
00:40:58,510 --> 00:41:00,160
Appreciating paintings with you

843
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,100
has been delightful.

844
00:41:01,100 --> 00:41:03,060
Being able
to appreciate paintings with you

845
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:04,460
also makes me very happy.

846
00:41:04,730 --> 00:41:06,030
Am I so happy

847
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,020
because I've seen so many

848
00:41:08,070 --> 00:41:09,310
of Mr. Lin Yuan's paintings?

849
00:41:09,310 --> 00:41:11,910
Or is it because Mr. Huang was the one

850
00:41:12,320 --> 00:41:13,850
appreciating them with me?

851
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,030
Miss Qiyue.

852
00:41:16,290 --> 00:41:17,090
What's wrong?

853
00:41:18,280 --> 00:41:19,320
N-Nothing.

854
00:41:20,860 --> 00:41:23,320
I came to the capital
because of Mr. Lin Yuan.

855
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:24,720
This happiness

856
00:41:25,180 --> 00:41:26,700
must be because of Mr. Lin Yuan.

857
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:27,590
Miss Qiyue.

858
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:29,950
Let's go then.

859
00:41:29,980 --> 00:41:30,570
Okay.

860
00:41:42,190 --> 00:41:42,710
Please.

861
00:41:49,080 --> 00:41:52,050
Mr. Lin Yuan is truly talented.

862
00:41:52,560 --> 00:41:54,210
After seeing so many of his paintings,

863
00:41:54,210 --> 00:41:55,810
I understand him better now.

864
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,600
His loneliness.

865
00:41:58,390 --> 00:41:59,510
His joy.

866
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,230
His inner thoughts.

867
00:42:02,350 --> 00:42:03,610
His open-mindedness.

868
00:42:05,860 --> 00:42:07,620
I must find Mr. Lin Yuan.

869
00:42:16,870 --> 00:42:17,630
Senior.

870
00:42:18,810 --> 00:42:19,910
Your...

871
00:42:20,370 --> 00:42:22,080
Senior, there's no one else here.

872
00:42:22,080 --> 00:42:23,590
No need for such formality.

873
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,000
Sit.

874
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,980
Junior, how have you been lately?

875
00:42:30,940 --> 00:42:32,820
Senior, hearing you call me that

876
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:35,330
reminds me of the days we trained together

877
00:42:35,330 --> 00:42:36,550
at Mount Qianya.

878
00:42:37,330 --> 00:42:39,860
Mount Qianya is the secret guard post
my father established for me.

879
00:42:39,860 --> 00:42:41,080
We grew up together,

880
00:42:41,550 --> 00:42:42,680
like real brothers.

881
00:42:43,510 --> 00:42:46,620
When my family was destroyed,
my foster father took me in.

882
00:42:46,620 --> 00:42:47,960
He taught the three of us

883
00:42:47,990 --> 00:42:49,740
to respect our master,
treat each other as brothers,

884
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:52,340
and always uphold
loyalty and righteousness.

885
00:42:53,390 --> 00:42:54,090
Senior,

886
00:42:54,830 --> 00:42:57,030
now the capital is full of hidden risks.

887
00:42:57,050 --> 00:42:58,710
You're the only one I can trust

888
00:42:58,800 --> 00:43:00,260
and rely on.

889
00:43:00,530 --> 00:43:01,330
Rest assured.

890
00:43:01,580 --> 00:43:03,210
I will fight alongside you

891
00:43:03,240 --> 00:43:04,840
to eliminate all obstacles.

892
00:43:06,370 --> 00:43:08,030
You've always been good to me,

893
00:43:08,310 --> 00:43:09,510
but these past years,

894
00:43:09,590 --> 00:43:11,120
you've truly endured much.

895
00:43:11,400 --> 00:43:12,880
You lived in concealment at Mount Qianya.

896
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,280
And I could only
bear the humiliation and wait.

897
00:43:14,280 --> 00:43:15,760
Those vermin corrupting the courtâ€”

898
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:18,490
we must eliminate
every last one of my uncle's men

899
00:43:19,700 --> 00:43:21,590
to end this threat once and for all.

900
00:43:21,590 --> 00:43:24,430
The rise and fall of the nation
concerns every citizen.

901
00:43:24,430 --> 00:43:26,940
I'm duty-bound in this.

902
00:43:27,490 --> 00:43:29,340
Besides, I didn't leave Mount Qianya

903
00:43:29,340 --> 00:43:31,070
solely for official business.

904
00:43:31,330 --> 00:43:33,260
Not solely for official business?

905
00:43:33,720 --> 00:43:36,020
Why haven't I heard you mention it before?

906
00:43:36,020 --> 00:43:36,870
What is it?

907
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,410
I came to the capital

908
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:40,530
also to find the little girl

909
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:42,960
who saved my life when I was a kid.

910
00:43:44,940 --> 00:43:46,180
I remember now.

911
00:43:46,310 --> 00:43:48,530
The little girl who gave you desserts

912
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:51,270
and the gold badge back then.

913
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:53,660
So, have you found her?

914
00:43:53,820 --> 00:43:55,880
Do you need me to send more men to help?

915
00:43:56,230 --> 00:43:57,160
No need for that.

916
00:43:57,580 --> 00:43:58,910
I've already found her.

917
00:44:02,360 --> 00:44:04,160
So you didn't leave Mount Qianya

918
00:44:04,170 --> 00:44:05,900
just to help solve my problems.

919
00:44:06,010 --> 00:44:08,070
You came for your little girl as well.

920
00:44:09,230 --> 00:44:10,080
Tell me,

921
00:44:10,270 --> 00:44:11,950
am I going to have a sister-in-law soon?

922
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,090
Alright, let's not talk about this now.

923
00:44:14,090 --> 00:44:16,850
I heard you've been departing the palace
frequently these days.

924
00:44:16,850 --> 00:44:18,560
Is it because
Marquis Wu'an has made new moves?
