[Episode 15]

3
00:00:47,030 --> 00:00:48,280
My mother

4
00:00:48,870 --> 00:00:51,640
is about to be crowned as the Empress.

5
00:00:52,210 --> 00:00:53,120
As for you,

6
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:55,230
what kind of legitimate son are you?

7
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:58,660
You're nothing but a motherless and abandoned child.

8
00:00:58,690 --> 00:00:59,440
What did you say?

9
00:00:59,470 --> 00:01:00,560
What do you mean by that?

10
00:01:02,570 --> 00:01:04,950
The Empress Dowager hasn't told you yet, has she?

11
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:06,500
It's no wonder.

12
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,480
After all, you're

13
00:01:08,940 --> 00:01:12,610
a cursed child, born but not raised by a mother.

14
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:14,480
Pei Si, I'll kill you!

15
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:24,330
Let's go.

[Bai's Mansion]

Next is Yun Yichen.

18
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:44,960
He originally wanted to marry Bai Xiyue.

19
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:48,039
I can get him to join me in breaking off the engagement.

20
00:01:48,520 --> 00:01:49,240
My Lady,

21
00:01:49,270 --> 00:01:50,320
please eat first.

22
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:52,710
You need strength to think of a solution.

23
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:55,900
I'm not very hungry.

24
00:01:56,340 --> 00:01:57,160
My Lady,

25
00:01:57,410 --> 00:01:59,840
shortly after you entered the palace today,

26
00:01:59,930 --> 00:02:02,110
my brother called me to meet Prince Yi.

27
00:02:04,450 --> 00:02:06,110
Why did Prince Yi want to see you?

28
00:02:06,730 --> 00:02:08,860
He asked me about your preferences.

29
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:10,820
I know you don't want to marry him,

30
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,330
so I declined.

31
00:02:13,650 --> 00:02:14,450
Well done.

32
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:16,400
We can't give him any chance.

33
00:02:17,450 --> 00:02:18,070
But...

34
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:19,930
My Lady,

35
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:22,790
Prince Yi...

36
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,740
What is it?

37
00:02:26,829 --> 00:02:27,700
My Lady,

38
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,230
I think Prince Yi is handsome and valiant.

39
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:31,530
He's also a national hero.

40
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:32,740
My brother said

41
00:02:32,770 --> 00:02:34,740
he's an admirable good man.

42
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,730
He has helped you many times too.

43
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,620
But, My Lady,

44
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:42,110
why do you dislike Prince Yi so much?

45
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,600
How should I put it...

46
00:02:46,420 --> 00:02:49,490
In this life, indeed, there hasn't been...

47
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:50,950
This life?

48
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:54,840
Well...

49
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:56,370
Firstly,

50
00:02:56,940 --> 00:02:58,980
I don't have any feelings for him.

51
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,240
Secondly,

52
00:03:00,990 --> 00:03:03,300
I don't like others controlling my marriage.

53
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:04,310
But

54
00:03:04,340 --> 00:03:06,580
wasn't this marriage bestowed by His Majesty?

55
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,730
Lianxin,

56
00:03:11,900 --> 00:03:13,460
you must be with someone

57
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:15,260
you truly love.

58
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:17,320
Don't be coerced by anyone,

59
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:18,900
and don't worry too much about others.

60
00:03:19,630 --> 00:03:20,960
In your life,

61
00:03:20,990 --> 00:03:23,890
the most important thing is to live sincerely and true to yourself.

62
00:03:24,770 --> 00:03:26,030
Otherwise, you'll regret it,

63
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:27,860
and there's no chance to start over.

64
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:31,150
My Lady,

65
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:33,000
I don't have anyone I like.

66
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,020
I only want to stay with you.

67
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:38,520
Prince Yi asked me

68
00:03:38,550 --> 00:03:40,420
who you like, My Lady.

69
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:43,270
Don't say anything reckless.

70
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,690
I don't have anyone I like.

71
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:47,200
Without gain, how can there be loss?

72
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,340
How can one let go without cherishing?

73
00:03:49,579 --> 00:03:51,060
I wonder what the Immortal Master means

74
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:52,540
by "seeing through

75
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:53,670
-the worldly entanglements"
-My Lady,

76
00:03:53,690 --> 00:03:54,950
actually, Prince Yi

77
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:57,430
asked me to deliver an invitation to you.

78
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:05,620
Tomorrow at noon,

79
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,230
Lady Xiyao is invited

80
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,010
to meet at Longfu Restaurant.

81
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:12,320
Although you didn't win the Eldest Prince's favor,

82
00:04:13,110 --> 00:04:14,880
you did save His Majesty.

83
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,630
You'll have to go to the palace more often.

84
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:18,399
Father,

85
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:20,120
I don't understand.

86
00:04:20,279 --> 00:04:22,850
Why do you want me to marry the Eldest Prince?

87
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,710
Haven't we always followed Her Majesty in supporting Pei Yan?

88
00:04:28,140 --> 00:04:30,010
Your aunt has controlled the Bai family for many years.

89
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:32,760
Although I am the head of the family,

90
00:04:32,780 --> 00:04:34,130
I have the title but no real power.

91
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:36,220
Not only does she refuse to pass on the formula for the Love-Slave Elixir to me,

92
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:37,020
but she even arranged

93
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,330
for me to marry Xiyao's sickly mother as my principal wife.

94
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,260
All these years,

95
00:04:41,290 --> 00:04:43,840
His Majesty has refused to entrust important tasks to me, the Empress Dowager's nephew.

96
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:44,909
Not to mention

97
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,270
your marriage.

98
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,409
It's all his bargaining chips.

99
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:52,080
You want to secure a better future

100
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,570
for yourself and your daughter,

101
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:55,200
so you're secretly taking orders from His Majesty?

102
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:56,020
No,

103
00:04:56,390 --> 00:04:57,970
it's the future Emperor,

104
00:04:58,070 --> 00:04:59,370
the Eldest Prince,

105
00:04:59,610 --> 00:05:00,520
Pei Si.

106
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:03,150
Yan,

107
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:04,170
what happened

108
00:05:04,190 --> 00:05:06,020
to your face?

109
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:07,500
Who bullied you?

110
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:08,990
I'm fine, Grandmother.

111
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:11,820
Today, Pei Si came to my mansion and caused trouble.

112
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:13,670
I had an argument with him.

113
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:16,590
That scoundrel.

114
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:18,250
He's becoming more and more unruly!

115
00:05:18,790 --> 00:05:20,130
Is Noble Consort Li trying to

116
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,590
teach him to defy the heavens?

117
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:25,420
Yan, get up quickly.

118
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:26,590
I will

119
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:28,230
definitely stand up for you.

120
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,220
Grandmother,

121
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:31,250
I don't hate or resent anyone.

122
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:34,050
I came today just to know

123
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
the truth about my mother's death.

124
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,180
Where did you hear such nonsense?

125
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,580
Your mother

126
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:44,380
died from a difficult childbirth due to her weak constitution.

127
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,060
There's no other truth to it.

128
00:05:46,620 --> 00:05:49,190
But since I was young, I've always heard rumors.

129
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:50,860
They say

130
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:53,430
Father blames me for my mother's death,

131
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:56,000
which is why he never likes me.

132
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:57,990
Silly child,

133
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:01,950
you are my favorite grandson.

134
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,100
You've never done anything wrong.

135
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:06,500
Don't live with self-blame.

136
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,320
But...

137
00:06:08,590 --> 00:06:10,530
the better you treat me,

138
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,410
the more unworthy I feel.

139
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,240
So I've never dared to ask for anything,

140
00:06:17,190 --> 00:06:19,920
nor compete with my brothers for anything.

141
00:06:23,790 --> 00:06:25,220
All of this

142
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:27,730
is what you deserve.

143
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,150
The entire Fengqi

144
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:30,990
should belong to you.

145
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:35,100
The reason I didn't tell you before

146
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:38,310
was to prevent a rift between you and your father.

147
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,000
Why do you insist on knowing the truth now?

148
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:43,150
Grandmother,

149
00:06:43,860 --> 00:06:46,130
I used to live too naively,

150
00:06:46,850 --> 00:06:48,670
but now I want to know clearly

151
00:06:48,690 --> 00:06:49,740
what I should do

152
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,300
and what I should have.

153
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:55,830
How can you be sure that Pei Si will ascend to the throne?

154
00:06:55,960 --> 00:06:57,680
The Eldest Prince's birth mother, Noble Consort Li,

155
00:06:57,700 --> 00:06:59,460
has always been favored by His Majesty.

156
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,220
Noble Consort Li becoming Empress

157
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:02,350
is only a matter of time.

158
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:04,580
Pei Si being named Crown Prince is also imminent.

159
00:07:05,170 --> 00:07:06,170
When that time comes,

160
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,840
what can the Empress Dowager,

161
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,240
a mere woman, possibly do?

162
00:07:09,570 --> 00:07:10,790
And if I had

163
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,430
the merit of supporting the future emperor,

164
00:07:12,630 --> 00:07:14,280
I'd then be the most honored

165
00:07:14,990 --> 00:07:16,420
and powerful minister.

166
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:18,670
For the next 20 years,

167
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,060
our Bai family

168
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,580
would be the most prominent family in the capital.

169
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:25,850
But if Pei Yan ascends to the throne,

170
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:27,610
Xiyao will also become Empress.

171
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:28,410
Wouldn't our Bai family

172
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:30,850
still be the most powerful royal relatives?

173
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,490
She wants to rely on a woman's status to protect the Bai family.

174
00:07:34,390 --> 00:07:35,700
It's ridiculous.

175
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:37,990
When has this world ever been influenced by women?

176
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,040
Whether a mother gains status through her son or is discarded while the son is kept,

177
00:07:41,290 --> 00:07:44,280
it all depends on the Emperor's whims to decide their fate.

178
00:07:46,190 --> 00:07:49,650
Back then, the Emperor favored only Noble Consort Li.

179
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:52,830
After your mother became pregnant with you,

180
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:57,680
ha had thoughts of keeping the child but discarding the mother.

181
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,630
He wanted to give Noble Consort Li's child,

182
00:08:00,650 --> 00:08:01,680
Pei Si,

183
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:04,970
an opportunity to rise to power.

184
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:07,260
So my mother didn't die from illness?

185
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:09,950
Back then,

186
00:08:10,220 --> 00:08:11,440
your mother

187
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:15,710
was close friends with Prince Yi's mother, the Duchess.

188
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:19,670
The two of them went to pray for blessings at the Houtingshan Temple,

189
00:08:20,530 --> 00:08:21,540
but upon their return,

190
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:24,130
she fell gravely ill.

191
00:08:26,230 --> 00:08:28,040
Your mother passed away

192
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:31,600
shortly after giving birth to you.

193
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,940
The Duke's Mansion

194
00:08:35,179 --> 00:08:37,470
was also punished for this,

195
00:08:37,539 --> 00:08:39,730
sent to the border to fight

196
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,730
against the Fengrong,

197
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,320
to atone for their crime.

198
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,010
So it was the Duke's Mansion that harmed my mother?

199
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,600
No.

200
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:52,870
It was the Emperor's clever plan to kill two birds with one stone.

201
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:57,830
The real poisoner

202
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:02,530
was also arranged by your father.

203
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,030
To consolidate imperial power,

204
00:09:07,530 --> 00:09:10,860
even his own wife and children can be sacrificed?

205
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,420
Without such imperial machinations,

206
00:09:13,730 --> 00:09:16,870
how could one monopolize such supreme power?

207
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:19,460
Yan,

208
00:09:20,750 --> 00:09:21,980
from now on,

209
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,630
you must never be soft-hearted again.

210
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:27,830
Yes.

211
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,760
Grandmother,

212
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,600
I will no longer

213
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:35,680
be childish in the future.

214
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:38,230
Good.

215
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,070
Before I rescued you,

216
00:09:47,110 --> 00:09:48,880
who were you waiting for?

217
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:50,090
My Lord,

218
00:09:50,250 --> 00:09:51,650
Lianxin has sent a reply.

219
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:53,730
Miss Bai has agreed to meet tomorrow.

220
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:55,800
Good.

221
00:09:56,290 --> 00:09:57,630
Then tell the innkeeper

222
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:59,250
to prepare a good meal according to

223
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:00,480
Miss Bai's preferences from last time.

224
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:01,080
Yes.

225
00:10:04,970 --> 00:10:07,370
Have our spies in the palace sent back any news?

226
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:08,400
My Lord,

227
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:09,820
they have successfully gone undercover.

228
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:10,990
But...

229
00:10:11,210 --> 00:10:13,390
why did we intentionally let them be discovered?

230
00:10:13,420 --> 00:10:14,950
The Empress Dowager and the Emperor

231
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,170
have always been at odds with each other,

232
00:10:17,620 --> 00:10:19,960
but when it comes to their attitude towards the Duke's Mansion,

233
00:10:19,990 --> 00:10:21,460
they are united.

234
00:10:21,730 --> 00:10:23,080
We use a fake assassination attempt

235
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:25,040
to make them suspicious of each other.

236
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,350
Only in this way

237
00:10:26,870 --> 00:10:30,590
can the Duke's Mansion seize the opportunity to plan our affairs.

238
00:10:30,610 --> 00:10:32,310
I understand.

239
00:10:33,290 --> 00:10:34,850
The spy reported that

240
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:36,790
the Bai sisters were also present.

241
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:38,430
Lady Xiyao was asking Her Majesty...

242
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,200
Stop.

243
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,380
To cancel the engagement, right?

244
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:46,320
I've heard this so many times today that I'm tired of it.

245
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:49,170
If she truly doesn't want to marry me,

246
00:10:50,820 --> 00:10:52,670
then I will cancel the engagement.

247
00:10:56,050 --> 00:10:57,170
However,

248
00:11:00,380 --> 00:11:02,000
I need to find another way

249
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:06,130
to save her life.

250
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:08,990
Immortal Master.

251
00:11:09,310 --> 00:11:11,260
Immortal Master, can I come back now?

252
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:13,120
Bai Xiyue.

253
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,200
You're...

254
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:24,150
Bai Xiyao?

255
00:11:26,760 --> 00:11:28,510
Go to hell!

256
00:11:28,950 --> 00:11:29,980
Wait.

257
00:11:30,740 --> 00:11:32,300
I'm not Bai Xiyue.

258
00:11:32,370 --> 00:11:33,760
I'm Bai Hong.

259
00:11:34,460 --> 00:11:37,200
You and Bai Xiyue are just avatars of my divine consciousness.

260
00:11:37,220 --> 00:11:38,150
I know.

261
00:11:39,030 --> 00:11:41,570
Although we are all part of your cultivation experience,

262
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,520
our love and hate

263
00:11:43,550 --> 00:11:44,920
are both real.

264
00:11:44,950 --> 00:11:48,340
Everything that happened exists in a certain world

265
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:51,980
and continues to affect the people in that world.

266
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,460
Why are you speaking even more cryptically than the Immortal Master?

267
00:11:57,450 --> 00:11:58,730
Anyway,

268
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,430
I'm sincerely trying to help you.

269
00:12:00,450 --> 00:12:02,100
You're helping yourself.

270
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:04,200
That's why you did those things for me.

271
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,440
But can this

272
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,480
really make you successful?

273
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,070
We are all one.

274
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,720
Isn't what I've done enough?

275
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,130
It's far from enough.

276
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:15,330
You haven't experienced the pain I've been through.

277
00:12:16,250 --> 00:12:18,220
I want you to be completely burned

278
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:20,220
to ashes by the Karmic Fire!

279
00:12:22,270 --> 00:12:23,320
No!

280
00:12:27,670 --> 00:12:29,010
Is this a dream...

281
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:32,120
or have I really returned to my divine consciousness?

282
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:37,860
My Lady,

283
00:12:37,890 --> 00:12:39,870
someone outside has delivered a brocade box,

284
00:12:39,890 --> 00:12:41,370
saying it's from your old friend.

285
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,200
I embroidered this for Brother Yun when I was a child.

286
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,030
Could he have returned?

287
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,820
[Our decade-long friendship is unforgettable. Meet me at Jinxi Pavilion by Wangxin Lake at 9AM on the eighth day.]

288
00:13:04,700 --> 00:13:05,590
Lianxin,

289
00:13:05,830 --> 00:13:08,540
I'd like to go sightseeing at Wangxin Lake tomorrow.

290
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,200
Alright.

291
00:13:09,230 --> 00:13:10,740
I'll arrange it right away.

292
00:13:11,190 --> 00:13:12,520
Just you and the coachman coming with me.

293
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,410
Don't let anyone in the family know.

294
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:17,060
I'm afraid Her Majesty won't be pleased if she finds out.

295
00:13:17,080 --> 00:13:17,900
Yes.

296
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,500
This is the real memory of Bai Xiyao

297
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:31,980
before she fell into the water?

298
00:13:32,430 --> 00:13:33,580
So,

299
00:13:34,140 --> 00:13:35,700
before she fell,

300
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,360
it was Yun Yichen who used the sachet

301
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:42,610
to invite Bai Xiyao out.

302
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:49,950
Miss Bai, why are you more reserved than last time?

303
00:13:50,650 --> 00:13:52,150
If you don't intend to marry me,

304
00:13:52,340 --> 00:13:53,600
why are you doing all this?

305
00:13:53,930 --> 00:13:55,460
What makes you say that?

306
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,760
I'm just being nice to my future Princess.

307
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:00,600
Isn't that what I should do?

308
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:03,270
You were originally going to marry Bai Xiyue in the hall.

309
00:14:03,830 --> 00:14:06,230
The Emperor wanted to disrupt the marriage alliance between Pei Yan and the Bai family,

310
00:14:06,250 --> 00:14:07,580
so he made me marry you instead.

311
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,920
Although you're exceptionally intelligent,

312
00:14:10,020 --> 00:14:12,890
talking about court affairs is a capital offense.

313
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:16,160
Let's get straight to the point.

314
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,940
How can I break off the engagement with you?

315
00:14:18,030 --> 00:14:20,790
Since you're unwilling to marry me,

316
00:14:21,070 --> 00:14:24,070
I'll go propose to your sister instead.

317
00:14:24,210 --> 00:14:25,240
No way.

318
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:27,190
My sister would never marry you.

319
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,380
She doesn't like you.

320
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,470
Then it's better not to cancel the engagement.

321
00:14:30,530 --> 00:14:31,330
Otherwise,

322
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,200
I would end up with nothing.

323
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:37,110
Why do you insist on marrying me?

324
00:14:37,140 --> 00:14:39,240
Why do you look down on me so much?

325
00:14:39,260 --> 00:14:40,960
And you've been deceiving me all along.

326
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:43,600
What have I been deceiving you?

327
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:47,200
You're my childhood sweetheart from the palace,

328
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:48,310
Little Bai.

329
00:14:48,330 --> 00:14:49,800
I really am not.

330
00:14:50,060 --> 00:14:51,860
It's the original Bai Xiyao.

331
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:55,470
How can I explain this to you?

332
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:58,660
So what?

333
00:14:58,690 --> 00:15:00,320
You are talented and handsome.

334
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:02,400
How many noble ladies want to marry you?

335
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,540
You can't just fixate on me...

336
00:15:06,900 --> 00:15:07,840
Because I like you.

337
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:10,340
Bai Xiyao,

338
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:12,240
I like you.

339
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:21,940
[Marriage]

340
00:15:21,940 --> 00:15:24,640
Why is it burning again?

341
00:15:27,430 --> 00:15:28,540
What...

342
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:30,220
What is it burning?

343
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:34,320
What surprise have you prepared for me?

344
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:36,290
Don't rush, it's in the room.

345
00:15:42,500 --> 00:15:43,440
Wedding dress.

346
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,000
The material for this wedding dress is the finest.

347
00:15:46,480 --> 00:15:48,320
I spent a full six months on it.

348
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,520
How is it?

349
00:15:49,540 --> 00:15:50,530
Do you like it?

350
00:15:52,230 --> 00:15:53,190
I like it.

351
00:15:53,210 --> 00:15:54,630
Thank you, Yichen.

352
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,100
Xiyue,

353
00:15:57,800 --> 00:15:59,420
when I come to marry you

354
00:15:59,730 --> 00:16:01,150
next month at the auspicious time,

355
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:03,820
you must be the most beautiful bride in the capital.

356
00:16:06,060 --> 00:16:07,990
I can't wait for that day.

357
00:16:08,580 --> 00:16:09,560
At that time,

358
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:12,360
I only wanted to get the seal of Yun's Army for Pei Yan.

359
00:16:12,590 --> 00:16:14,360
I didn't want to marry Yun Yichen.
