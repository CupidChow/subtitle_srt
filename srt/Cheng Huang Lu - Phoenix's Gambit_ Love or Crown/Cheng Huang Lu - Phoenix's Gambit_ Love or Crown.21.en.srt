[Episode 21]

3
00:00:46,490 --> 00:00:48,750
To betray one's love is the real mistake!

4
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:50,960
I'm sorry, Xiyao.

5
00:00:51,060 --> 00:00:52,250
I shouldn't have said that.

6
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:53,020
I'm a fool,

7
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:54,010
and I said things without thinking,

8
00:00:54,010 --> 00:00:54,940
which upset you.

9
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:56,520
I'll never do that again.

10
00:00:57,830 --> 00:00:58,940
I'm sorry.

11
00:01:00,830 --> 00:01:02,950
Don't hurt yourself ever again in the future,

12
00:01:02,950 --> 00:01:03,800
okay?

13
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:04,730
Okay.

14
00:01:05,450 --> 00:01:07,390
I'll do whatever you say.

15
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:24,320
I'm sorry.

16
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:58,979
My beloved.

17
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,310
My beloved, I love you so much.

18
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:03,220
I too am devoted to Your Majesty.

19
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:04,570
Being able to serve Your Majesty

20
00:02:04,570 --> 00:02:06,610
is the greatest blessing in my life.

21
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:07,640
My beloved.

22
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:10,110
The tonic you gave me last time

23
00:02:10,139 --> 00:02:11,680
was truly miraculous.

24
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,150
It made me feel...

25
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:16,480
as though I had regained all my vigor and strength.

26
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,610
Do you have more?

27
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,240
Hurry and give it to me.

28
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,470
Your Majesty.

29
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:24,450
If I were to bear Your Majesty a child,

30
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,360
how would you treat us then?

31
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:29,500
Why such haste, my beloved?

32
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,960
There is no hurry for a child, even several years hence.

33
00:02:35,630 --> 00:02:38,340
But since Your Majesty granted me a night with you last time,

34
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:40,220
I haven't had my monthly cycle.

35
00:02:40,579 --> 00:02:42,450
If I truly am with child,

36
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:45,200
I fear there will be gossip.

37
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:49,560
If you, my beloved,

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,970
truly bear me a son...

39
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,270
then he shall be the future Crown Prince.

40
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:03,560
Do you truly mean it, Your Majesty?

41
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:09,030
A sovereign's word is never in jest.

42
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,720
My beloved,

43
00:03:12,890 --> 00:03:15,070
let us continue.

44
00:03:18,970 --> 00:03:19,770
Your Majesty.

45
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,240
What's wrong with you, Prince Yi?

46
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,620
Rise now.

47
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:28,440
Your Majesty,

48
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:30,720
the heiress of the Bai family doesn't want to marry me.

49
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:32,640
She harbors resentment toward me.

50
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,370
She wounded me with her own hand

51
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,880
when I sent the betrothal gifts yesterday.

52
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:39,970
Is that truly so?

53
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:42,170
Then I must hold

54
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,660
Minister Bai accountable for failing to properly discipline his daughter.

55
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,780
Our Yun family absolutely cannot accept such a shrewish woman.

56
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:48,560
I beg Your Majesty to withdraw the decree

57
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,650
and annul the engagement.

58
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:51,870
But the marriage has already been announced to the world.

59
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:53,660
If this family disgrace were to spread,

60
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:55,910
it would not only tarnish our royal family's reputation

61
00:03:55,910 --> 00:03:57,140
but also the Empress Dowager's Bai family,

62
00:03:57,140 --> 00:03:58,390
and your Yun family

63
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:00,550
would surely become bitter enemies.

64
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:03,360
Your Majesty,

65
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:05,320
according to my family tradition,

66
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:07,140
we must return to our hometown of Luzhou

67
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:10,470
at the time of marriage to pay our respects to our ancestors.

68
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,640
Yichen!

69
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,610
With my body in this condition,

70
00:04:19,950 --> 00:04:22,010
I'm afraid I cannot return to Luzhou.

71
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:26,600
Prince Yi, you can rest assured on this matter.

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,430
I'll arrange for the imperial physician most skilled
in treating external injuries to accompany you.

73
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:31,600
Prince Yi, the imperial physician will not return to the palace

74
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:33,970
until you have fully recovered.

75
00:04:34,290 --> 00:04:36,470
All the medicinal herbs and pills needed

76
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,320
will be provided from the imperial treasury.

77
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:39,150
Your Majesty.

78
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:43,570
Yichen's journey will be long and arduous.

79
00:04:43,590 --> 00:04:44,690
If he's not careful,

80
00:04:44,690 --> 00:04:47,620
he might lose his life.

81
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,820
Prince Yi, he was born valiant

82
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,610
and blessed with good fortune.

83
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:55,170
His journey will surely be safe

84
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:57,030
without accidents.

85
00:04:58,700 --> 00:04:59,570
Prince Yi,

86
00:05:00,340 --> 00:05:02,560
when you two return to the capital after the ancestral rites,

87
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,150
I will

88
00:05:04,170 --> 00:05:05,400
hold a wedding for you

89
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,490
that is equal

90
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:08,370
to an imperial wedding ceremony.

91
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,620
I humbly obey Your Majesty's decree.

92
00:05:17,310 --> 00:05:19,840
Thank you for Your Majesty's great kindness.

[Yun Family Ancestral Home in Luzhou]

95
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:36,409
[Yun's Mansion]

96
00:05:44,920 --> 00:05:46,050
My family

97
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:47,880
is a prestigious clan in Luzhou,

98
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:48,930
with strong troops

99
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:50,390
and power over the region.

100
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,310
The Pei family's ancestors sought alliance with our Yun family in their uprising,

101
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,310
and that's how we gradually built up these 300,000 troops of Yun's Army.

102
00:05:57,350 --> 00:05:59,930
Your Majesty has already deprived your family of its military power.

103
00:05:59,930 --> 00:06:01,840
Why is he still so guarded against you?

104
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:02,920
Because we

105
00:06:02,940 --> 00:06:05,470
have something that could topple his throne.

106
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,790
-Grand General!
-Grand General!

107
00:06:17,790 --> 00:06:20,920
I am no longer the Grand General defending the frontier,

108
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:24,250
merely a powerless non-imperial prince.

109
00:06:24,450 --> 00:06:26,500
Your Highness, why have you

110
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:27,750
summoned us here today?

111
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:29,010
This time, I've called you here

112
00:06:29,010 --> 00:06:31,480
because there's an important task for you to do.

113
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:32,030
When the time comes,

114
00:06:32,030 --> 00:06:33,970
I'll need you to use your army

115
00:06:34,420 --> 00:06:36,750
to swiftly take control of the entire capital.

116
00:06:36,750 --> 00:06:39,140
Your Highness, are you planning a rebellion?

117
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:41,480
We won't become traitors or rebels!

118
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,240
Then you should all recognize this, don't you?

119
00:07:01,630 --> 00:07:03,140
Yun's Loong Talisman!

120
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,590
United in life, inseparable in death!

121
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,780
A great upheaval is about to occur in the capital.

122
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:08,590
I want you to join me in protecting the rightful king.

123
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:10,220
After the new king ascends to the throne,

124
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,330
all of you will be rewarded according to your merits.

125
00:07:12,330 --> 00:07:14,000
We are under the command of the Loong Talisman

126
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,130
and will follow the Yun family's lead!

127
00:07:35,150 --> 00:07:36,130
Lady Xiyue,

128
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:38,000
please starch and wash these  first.

129
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,350
These are the robes that Lady Xiyao will wear for the banquet

130
00:07:39,350 --> 00:07:40,600
the day after tomorrow.

131
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:41,530
Leave them here.

132
00:07:41,530 --> 00:07:43,190
Looks like it's about to rain.

133
00:07:52,830 --> 00:07:54,480
This is the snowflake crisp I secretly saved.

134
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:55,400
It's for you.

135
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:58,290
Thank you, Lianxin.

136
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:02,270
Lady Xiyue, if it weren't for you pleading for me back then,

137
00:08:02,270 --> 00:08:04,130
I might have been beaten to death.

138
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,520
I'll never forget that, even in death.

139
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:06,650
You are my savior.

140
00:08:07,250 --> 00:08:08,930
Don't say that.

141
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:11,120
We are all merely unfortunate souls.

142
00:08:11,630 --> 00:08:13,430
In the future, when we're alone,

143
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,370
let's treat each other as friends.

144
00:08:15,470 --> 00:08:16,430
Friends it is.

145
00:08:19,050 --> 00:08:20,830
Who is that general?

146
00:08:20,850 --> 00:08:22,660
That's none other than Prince Yi, the Duke.

147
00:08:22,660 --> 00:08:24,280
He is Lady Xiyao's admirer.

148
00:08:24,580 --> 00:08:27,110
I must hurry to the main hall to attend to them.

149
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:51,170
Lianxin and I support each other...

150
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,100
and I secretly have feelings for Yun Yichen?

151
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:01,280
What a ridiculous dream.

152
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:07,270
Your Highness,

153
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,200
there's news of your elder sister.

154
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,330
She has returned to the Bai's Mansion?

155
00:09:11,330 --> 00:09:12,190
Your Highness,

156
00:09:12,210 --> 00:09:14,580
after Miss Bai Xiyao returned from the ancestral rites with Prince Yi,

157
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:16,140
she has been staying at Qingzhi Pavilion.

158
00:09:16,140 --> 00:09:19,000
Today, she went to pay her respects to Consort Xian.

159
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,520
Very well.

160
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:22,370
If you don't come to see me...

161
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:26,800
then I shall come to find you.

162
00:09:31,580 --> 00:09:34,230
I told you my aunt would like you very much.

163
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:36,230
You acted so normal in front of Consort Xian just now,

164
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:37,520
as if nothing was wrong.

165
00:09:37,520 --> 00:09:39,230
And now you need me to help you walk?

166
00:09:39,230 --> 00:09:41,400
I just didn't want to make my aunt worry.

167
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:42,450
Besides,

168
00:09:42,470 --> 00:09:44,560
you were the one who stabbed me in the first place.

169
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:46,390
Shouldn't you take better care of me, my dear?

170
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:47,190
You...

171
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,580
What?

172
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:52,400
Cousin Yan?

173
00:09:54,670 --> 00:09:55,650
Prince Yi.

174
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:57,740
May I have a word with you in private?

175
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:01,410
Wait for me in the carriage.

176
00:10:01,410 --> 00:10:03,340
I'll come find you once we're done.

177
00:10:18,430 --> 00:10:19,620
Prince Yan,

178
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:22,500
if you have something to say, please speak freely.

179
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:29,470
What are you doing, Prince Yan?

180
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:30,760
I have a favor

181
00:10:31,230 --> 00:10:32,790
to ask of you, Prince Yi.

182
00:10:33,410 --> 00:10:34,810
Then, stand up and speak.

183
00:10:35,270 --> 00:10:37,220
Prince Yi, you're a first-rank duke.

184
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,280
You can certainly receive my kowtow.

185
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:40,110
Prince Yi.

186
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,210
After you marry Xiyao...

187
00:10:44,520 --> 00:10:46,170
I hope you will cherish her.

188
00:10:49,480 --> 00:10:51,160
This is my family matter.

189
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:53,400
You don't need to concern yourself with it.

190
00:10:53,400 --> 00:10:54,880
Nor should you kneel to me.

191
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:00,120
Prince Yi!

192
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,950
There is also a favor about me.

193
00:11:03,670 --> 00:11:05,000
In my claim to the crown,

194
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:07,230
I hope Your Highness...

195
00:11:08,710 --> 00:11:10,500
will stand by my side.

196
00:11:11,990 --> 00:11:13,350
Rise.

197
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:38,400
Xiyao, you're here.

198
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,520
You still have the nerve to come to me?

199
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:40,150
How dare you!

200
00:11:40,150 --> 00:11:42,150
Show some respect to Your Highness!

201
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,280
What have I done to upset you, Xiyao?

202
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,840
You're so angry.

203
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:49,050
Do you really want me to say it out loud here?

204
00:11:49,050 --> 00:11:50,320
All of you, leave us.

205
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:52,100
Don't come any closer unless I say so.

206
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,230
Yes, Your Highness.

207
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:01,860
I told you long ago

208
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:02,670
not to scheme against me!

209
00:12:02,670 --> 00:12:04,540
I've let the past go.

210
00:12:05,510 --> 00:12:08,040
But now, you dare to set your sights on Pei Yan.

211
00:12:08,410 --> 00:12:10,160
What exactly do you want?

212
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:13,450
I want you dead.

213
00:12:13,470 --> 00:12:15,470
I want to see you lose everything.

214
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,970
I want to take away everything you hold dear.

215
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:21,640
No matter what has happened in the past,

216
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,240
we are still sisters, after all.

217
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:24,890
Now that you've become a royal consort,

218
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:26,690
a bright future lies before you.

219
00:12:26,700 --> 00:12:28,660
I certainly won't fight you over anything.

220
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,390
Why do you still hate me so much?

221
00:12:31,150 --> 00:12:32,380
I don't know.

222
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,960
You've indeed taken good care of me since we were young,

223
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:36,460
but I just hate you.

224
00:12:36,490 --> 00:12:38,200
It's not because of your status,

225
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,800
nor because you're better than me in some ways.

226
00:12:40,890 --> 00:12:43,930
I just feel that you are my lifelong enemy.

227
00:12:44,250 --> 00:12:47,110
In this life, it's either you die

228
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,880
or I die.

229
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:55,640
If you were me,

230
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,500
how would you want to live?

231
00:12:57,830 --> 00:12:59,320
Parents' love,

232
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:00,720
a sister's indulgence,

233
00:13:01,170 --> 00:13:02,860
a lover's unwavering devotion,

234
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:04,560
and supreme power.

235
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:08,760
If you had all of this,

236
00:13:09,210 --> 00:13:10,580
would you be happy?

237
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:12,990
Of course I would.

238
00:13:13,250 --> 00:13:15,550
I want to have all the good things in this world

239
00:13:15,550 --> 00:13:17,700
and to live in a world without you.

240
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,180
Fine.

241
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:22,420
I can't help you

242
00:13:22,430 --> 00:13:23,500
with your love.

243
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:25,400
You want supreme power,

244
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:27,060
and I'll help you fight for it.

245
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:29,730
As long as you feel you've gotten everything you want,

246
00:13:29,730 --> 00:13:32,060
and you want me dead when the time comes...

247
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,380
then so be it.

248
00:13:34,410 --> 00:13:36,610
I won't have a single word of complaint.

249
00:13:40,150 --> 00:13:41,050
Alright.

250
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:43,880
Using you costs me nothing.

251
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:51,270
[Power]

252
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:55,660
Bai Xiyao.

253
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:59,470
So, you, too, once longed for power.

254
00:14:02,750 --> 00:14:03,750
It smells wonderful,

255
00:14:03,750 --> 00:14:04,780
truly wonderful.

256
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:06,070
This jade ruyi

257
00:14:06,100 --> 00:14:07,650
truly has a unique fragrance.

258
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:08,690
Xiyue,

259
00:14:08,710 --> 00:14:11,420
where did you get such a rare treasure?

260
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:12,750
My Yanxia Pavilion

261
00:14:12,770 --> 00:14:14,870
often trades spices in the Western Regions.

262
00:14:14,870 --> 00:14:16,530
I happened to acquire this treasure

263
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:19,310
and thought of presenting it to Noble Consort Li on her birthday

264
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:20,570
so that Father

265
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:23,770
can make a good impression on the Eldest Prince.

266
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:26,940
How did you know I was going to present a gift to Noble Consort Li?

267
00:14:26,940 --> 00:14:27,700
Dear, I...

268
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,700
Father.

269
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:31,990
Now that I'm a consort, if I want to live peacefully in the palace,

270
00:14:31,990 --> 00:14:34,080
I must, of course, please Noble Consort Li.

271
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,740
Moreover, there's also the Eldest Prince.

272
00:14:36,760 --> 00:14:38,070
Your sister knows nothing of this, does she?

273
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:40,920
There must be no word of this reaching the Empress Dowager.

274
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,470
I have grown up,

275
00:14:42,490 --> 00:14:45,550
and now I have gained His Majesty's favor in the palace.

276
00:14:45,630 --> 00:14:47,470
I want to share some of the burden

277
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,980
for securing future prospects of the Bai family, Father.

278
00:14:49,980 --> 00:14:50,680
Good.

279
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:53,150
Xiyue, you are a good daughter.

280
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:54,370
Before long,

281
00:14:54,390 --> 00:14:55,750
I will rise quickly in my career

282
00:14:55,750 --> 00:14:57,880
and reach an even higher position.
