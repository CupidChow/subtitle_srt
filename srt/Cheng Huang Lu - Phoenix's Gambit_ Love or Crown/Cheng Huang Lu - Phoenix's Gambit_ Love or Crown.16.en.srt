[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,850 --> 00:00:46,360
[Episode 16]

3
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,080
Even if it's beautiful,

4
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:50,060
it's not from the royal family.

5
00:00:50,830 --> 00:00:52,890
On my wedding day,

6
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:57,010
I will wear the Empress's phoenix crown and robes.

7
00:00:59,710 --> 00:01:01,300
Who wants to marry you?

8
00:01:01,330 --> 00:01:03,030
Who wants to marry you?

9
00:01:03,960 --> 00:01:05,720
You're just dreaming.

10
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:07,020
What sincerity?

11
00:01:07,070 --> 00:01:08,530
What love?

12
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:15,120
They're all ridiculous things.

13
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:17,850
They mean nothing to me!

14
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,539
My Lady.

15
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:23,030
Come in.

16
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,080
My Lady.

17
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:35,500
Everything has been arranged.

18
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:37,380
To buy some time,

19
00:01:37,590 --> 00:01:39,670
I have to trouble Xiyao again.

20
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:44,880
Make our move when His Lordship returns.

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,740
Yes.

22
00:01:48,770 --> 00:01:49,770
Xiyao.

23
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,280
Xiyao,

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:53,340
it's all my fault.

25
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:54,620
Don't take your anger out on the wedding dress.

26
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:55,610
Bai Xiyue,

27
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:57,270
don't you try to frame me.

28
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,470
What's going on here?

29
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:03,030
Yichen,

30
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,930
I came back from the rouge shop today

31
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,170
and saw the wedding dress like this.

32
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,340
I know you don't like this wedding dress, Xiyao.

33
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,650
I could just take it back to the Bai Residence.

34
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,270
Why did you have to ruin it like this?

35
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,170
It's not like that.

36
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:16,420
It was already like this when I went to your room.

37
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,930
Bai Xiyue destroyed it herself.

38
00:02:17,960 --> 00:02:19,070
Bai Xiyao,

39
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:20,360
haven't I told you

40
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:22,630
that you're not allowed to set foot in my room?

41
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,079
Didn't you ask the servant

42
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,970
to have me change the out-of-season bedding?

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,730
I really didn't touch it.

44
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:29,630
Bai Xiyao,

45
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:31,240
you're not only jealous now

46
00:02:31,260 --> 00:02:32,800
but also distorting ing the truth.

47
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:34,290
What do you want?

48
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:39,810
Darling, look.

49
00:02:39,829 --> 00:02:41,500
The rouge on it isn't mine.

50
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,420
I really didn't do it.

51
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,060
You've gone mad.

52
00:02:44,650 --> 00:02:46,370
Xiyue, are you alright?

53
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:48,250
I'm fine.

54
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,560
Please don't blame Xiyao.

55
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:57,120
Why don't you believe me?

56
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:01,570
Now the wedding dress is ruined,

57
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,950
the wedding will have to be postponed.

58
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,850
What are we going to do?

59
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:14,740
Xiyue,

60
00:03:14,880 --> 00:03:15,730
it's alright.

61
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:18,050
I'll have someone make you a better one.

62
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:19,970
Servant,

63
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,850
burn this one.

64
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:23,700
Let's go.

65
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:31,980
Xiyue,

66
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:35,180
do you love me?

67
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,950
Of course I love you.

68
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:41,840
I love you too.

69
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:44,260
I love you like crazy.

70
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,950
I can't live a moment without you.

71
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:50,050
But I feel so anxious inside.

72
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:54,810
What's making you feel uneasy?

73
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:56,020
I don't know.

74
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,250
I don't know who I am.

75
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,040
I don't know what I'm doing.

76
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:06,470
All I know is that I love you.

77
00:04:08,860 --> 00:04:10,520
Don't think too much.

78
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,180
Yichen,

79
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:14,350
you only need to love me.

80
00:04:20,709 --> 00:04:21,600
Xiyue,

81
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,780
is it wrong to love someone?

82
00:04:24,930 --> 00:04:26,230
Am I wrong?

83
00:04:27,890 --> 00:04:29,270
Of course not.

84
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:32,409
How could you be wrong?

85
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,890
But Xiyue,

86
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,900
can you love me a little more?

87
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,050
Just a little more.

88
00:04:41,070 --> 00:04:42,780
Then I won't feel so anxious.

89
00:04:43,310 --> 00:04:44,260
Xiyue,

90
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:46,740
can you love me a little more?

91
00:04:54,630 --> 00:04:56,310
In my previous life, apart from Bai Xiyao,

92
00:04:56,670 --> 00:04:57,920
the person I've wronged the most

93
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,500
-must be you, Yun Yichen.
-What's wrong?

94
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,400
Not to your taste?

95
00:05:00,650 --> 00:05:01,640
My Lord,

96
00:05:01,660 --> 00:05:03,250
one should not talk while eating.

97
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:05,000
Can you let me eat in peace?

98
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:07,600
Then let me speak

99
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,940
and you listen, alright?

100
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,340
I deliberately proposed to marry Bai Xiyue at court,

101
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,900
not because I wanted to marry her,

102
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:16,900
but because I knew

103
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:19,110
the Emperor would never allow it.

104
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,220
Think about it.

105
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,770
Of the two ladies from the Bai family,

106
00:05:22,050 --> 00:05:23,840
one marrying the Third Prince,

107
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,390
and the other marrying Prince Yi.

108
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,880
What kind of situation would that be?

109
00:05:27,190 --> 00:05:29,850
His Majesty would certainly not allow

110
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:32,050
the Duke's Mansion and the Empress Dowager's Bai family

111
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:33,260
to become in-laws.

112
00:05:33,310 --> 00:05:35,120
They would all become Pei Yan's support.

113
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,510
But why agree to let me marry you?

114
00:05:37,830 --> 00:05:38,830
Marrying an illegitimate daughter

115
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:40,530
is just taking a concubine.

116
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:41,900
Marrying a legitimate daughter,

117
00:05:41,930 --> 00:05:44,120
the Duke's Mansion must hold a grand ceremony.

118
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:46,700
And with your status as a royal relative,

119
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,020
it would restrain me from returning to the border fief.

120
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,990
Without the Yun's Army,

121
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:55,010
I'm nothing but a useless Duke in the capital.

122
00:05:55,030 --> 00:05:56,380
Then why do you still want to marry me?

123
00:05:56,890 --> 00:05:58,360
What has gotten into you?

124
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:00,280
Whether you're Little Bai or not,

125
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:02,220
I like you as you are now,

126
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,670
apart from your appearance and status.

127
00:06:08,650 --> 00:06:09,680
I don't know

128
00:06:10,310 --> 00:06:13,130
how to describe this feeling.

129
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:15,500
I can't help but want to know everything about you.

130
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:17,420
I'm afraid of losing you.

131
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:19,150
I know

132
00:06:19,350 --> 00:06:21,510
that based on my childish feelings from childhood,

133
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:25,380
insisting that you must like me now

134
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:27,530
is a bit abrupt and overbearing,

135
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:28,500
which is...

136
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,490
why you hate me so much.

137
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,659
Why in the previous life and this one,

138
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:34,840
does Yun Yichen inexplicably fall in love with me?

139
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,560
This unavoidable emotional bond,

140
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,060
could it be fate?

141
00:06:39,080 --> 00:06:40,250
Actually,

142
00:06:40,360 --> 00:06:42,450
I... I don't hate you.

143
00:06:42,470 --> 00:06:43,730
I've been avoiding you

144
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:46,930
because I feel I'm not worthy, I suppose.

145
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:49,310
What do you mean by not worthy?

146
00:06:49,350 --> 00:06:50,770
In my previous life,

147
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:53,080
I did so many things that hurt you all.

148
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:54,380
How could I

149
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:57,100
shamelessly enjoy happiness in this life?

150
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,360
Please enjoy your meal.

151
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:10,470
I still need some time.

152
00:07:10,990 --> 00:07:12,800
I have many things left unfinished.

153
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:16,400
I want to put our matters on hold.

154
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:17,960
Are you willing to wait for me?

155
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:20,790
I can help you accomplish what you want to do,

156
00:07:21,040 --> 00:07:23,020
so that I don't have to wait too long.

157
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:26,570
You can't eat that.

158
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:27,900
It contains cheese.

159
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:29,190
You can't digest it.

160
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:38,580
How do you know I can't eat cheese?

161
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,190
I... I just guessed.

162
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:49,320
Just tell me.

163
00:07:50,030 --> 00:07:51,280
An imperial decree has been issued from the palace.

164
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:52,920
The Second Miss Bai is to enter the palace

165
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:54,330
and be bestowed the title of Consort Hui.

166
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:58,220
Bai Xiyue has become a consort?

167
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:59,070
[By the mandate of Heaven, His Majesty decrees: The daughter of Minister Bai Wenli, Bai Xiyue,]

168
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:58,630
[She is quite pleasing to me, so I hereby bestow upon her the title of Consort Hui, so that she may always be by my side.]

169
00:07:58,630 --> 00:07:58,630
[known for her gentle, respectful, and virtuous nature, has long been a paragon of grace and propriety, thus deserving of this honor.]

170
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,430
What on earth is going on?

171
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,060
What kind of seductive tricks did you use?

172
00:08:03,060 --> 00:08:04,530
Why would His Majesty take you as a consort?

173
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:05,360
Father,

174
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:07,240
I truly know nothing about this.

175
00:08:07,260 --> 00:08:09,000
I've only met His Majesty once.

176
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:10,590
Dear, our daughter entering the palace

177
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:11,850
might lead to a bright future.

178
00:08:11,870 --> 00:08:14,170
It's better than being a concubine to some noble family's son, isn't it?

179
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,700
What do you know?

180
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:16,050
Chaos.

181
00:08:16,070 --> 00:08:16,420
It's all in chaos.

182
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:17,510
Everything is in chaos.

183
00:08:17,540 --> 00:08:18,770
How can I still have any diginity

184
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:20,200
in the court from now on?

185
00:08:20,230 --> 00:08:20,970
Go away!

186
00:08:21,030 --> 00:08:21,590
Dear.

187
00:08:21,620 --> 00:08:23,520
You women are nothing but the bane of evil.

188
00:08:24,090 --> 00:08:24,590
Father.

189
00:08:24,610 --> 00:08:25,690
Dear.

190
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:27,160
You saying so

191
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:29,290
would be disloyal and unfilial.

192
00:08:29,480 --> 00:08:30,450
What did you say?

193
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:32,110
You're saying I'm disloyal and unfilial?

194
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,830
You say women are the bane of evil.

195
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:35,740
Men are also born of women.

196
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,830
You're saying grandmother is a bane of evil.

197
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:39,130
Isn't that unfilial?

198
00:08:39,309 --> 00:08:41,020
Moreover, the Bai family's honors over the years

199
00:08:41,059 --> 00:08:42,860
are all thanks to Her Majesty.

200
00:08:42,890 --> 00:08:44,610
You're disrespectful to Her Majesty.

201
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:45,830
Isn't that disloyal?

202
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:46,420
I...

203
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:48,770
I... I'll teach you a lesson, you unfilial daughter!

204
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:52,310
Xiyao,

205
00:08:52,340 --> 00:08:54,290
quickly apologize to Father.

206
00:08:59,520 --> 00:09:01,920
I am the Duchess granted by His Majesty.

207
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:03,860
As the wife of a non-imperial prince, I am also royalty.

208
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,300
The Bai family's relatives are no comparison.

209
00:09:06,990 --> 00:09:09,110
The reason I endured this slap

210
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:11,430
is because you are still my father for now.

211
00:09:11,650 --> 00:09:12,870
But please, Father,

212
00:09:12,890 --> 00:09:14,960
mind your manners and status,

213
00:09:15,030 --> 00:09:17,680
so as no to ruin our father-daughter relationship.

214
00:09:17,710 --> 00:09:18,730
You... you...

215
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:20,190
How dare you!

216
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:22,120
Come with me.

217
00:09:22,140 --> 00:09:22,980
I have something to ask you.

218
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:26,820
Look at her.

219
00:09:26,840 --> 00:09:28,820
-How outrageous!
-Dear.

220
00:09:30,780 --> 00:09:32,230
The Emperor taking you as his consort,

221
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:33,640
was it your scheme?

222
00:09:33,990 --> 00:09:34,780
Xiyao,

223
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:35,970
I've told Father as well,

224
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,590
I really don't know anything about it.

225
00:09:37,780 --> 00:09:39,760
I still can't believe

226
00:09:39,790 --> 00:09:41,800
that His Majesty would favor

227
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:43,270
a mere concubine's daughter like me.

228
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,990
When you met His Majesty in the Empress Dowager's chamber that day,

229
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:48,780
did you use some kind of trick?

230
00:09:49,830 --> 00:09:50,840
Xiyao,

231
00:09:50,870 --> 00:09:53,040
how can you accuse me without any evidence?

232
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:55,150
His Majesty is about the same age as Father,

233
00:09:55,180 --> 00:09:56,840
and he's also our cousin uncle.

234
00:09:57,810 --> 00:10:00,610
How could I possibly want to be his woman?

235
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:02,500
You used the Love-Slave Elixir,

236
00:10:02,520 --> 00:10:03,610
didn't you?

237
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:08,860
I don't know what you're talking about.

238
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:11,630
What Love-Slave Elixir?

239
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:13,080
Bai Xiyue,

240
00:10:13,740 --> 00:10:15,110
don't treat me like a fool.

241
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:17,480
Father stole the Love-Slave Elixir from Her Majesty,

242
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:19,950
and had you seduce the prince at the birthday banquet.

243
00:10:21,980 --> 00:10:23,750
Do you want me to continue?

244
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:26,340
Yes,

245
00:10:26,980 --> 00:10:28,540
I used the Love-Slave Elixir.

246
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:31,100
Guards! Protect His Majesty!

247
00:10:31,960 --> 00:10:32,770
Protect His Majesty!

248
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,630
I had to seize the chance to get close to

249
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:37,480
His Majesty's tea.

250
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:39,750
I'm fine.

251
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,750
It's rare to see such loyalty.

252
00:10:47,930 --> 00:10:50,960
Take Miss Bai to the Imperial Hospital for treatment.

253
00:10:59,010 --> 00:11:00,110
Your Majesty,

254
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:02,320
I will take my leave with Xiyue.

255
00:11:04,940 --> 00:11:05,930
Long live Your Majesty.

256
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,000
We'll take our leave.

257
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:09,880
-Minister Bai has two good daughters.
-Let's go, Xiyue.

258
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,630
What good fortune.

259
00:11:15,340 --> 00:11:16,850
To have an audience with Your Majesty

260
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,830
is also good fortune for me.

261
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:20,430
Long live Your Majesty.

262
00:11:23,270 --> 00:11:24,860
When did you start planning this?

263
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:28,390
I was looking for opportunities in the Imperial Garden.

264
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,570
Unexpectedly, I encountered the Emperor.

265
00:11:32,050 --> 00:11:34,620
Then I used the Love-Slave Elixir to keep him interested.

266
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,480
He will surely summon me to the palace.

267
00:11:38,690 --> 00:11:40,200
You're so daring.

268
00:11:40,380 --> 00:11:42,210
Aren't you afraid our whole family will lose our heads?

269
00:11:42,280 --> 00:11:44,620
Opportunities are fleeting.

270
00:11:44,650 --> 00:11:47,200
Not seizing an opportunity and failing to seize it

271
00:11:47,230 --> 00:11:48,930
are two different things.

272
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,420
On the day of Her Majesty's birthday banquet,

273
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,960
I thought you were acting suspiciously.

274
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:54,320
Your target wasn't Pei Yan,

275
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,000
but Pei Si.

276
00:11:56,810 --> 00:11:59,310
Cousin Yan is deeply in love with you.

277
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,070
How could I be so presumptuous

278
00:12:02,410 --> 00:12:04,620
as to steal what others cherish?

279
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:07,900
No one knows you better than me.

280
00:12:08,110 --> 00:12:09,710
Even if it's something not belong to me,

281
00:12:09,960 --> 00:12:11,240
if I want it,

282
00:12:11,260 --> 00:12:12,930
I'll get it by any means necessary.

283
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:14,860
I told you,

284
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,820
lying to me is useless.

285
00:12:17,010 --> 00:12:18,680
It wasn't Father's plan,

286
00:12:19,010 --> 00:12:20,760
but your own idea.

287
00:12:24,230 --> 00:12:27,090
I always thought I knew you well,

288
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:29,500
but it turns out you know me even better.

289
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:32,510
So I find you increasingly hard to read now.

290
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,290
You always see through me so easily.

291
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:38,130
Xiyue,

292
00:12:38,150 --> 00:12:40,170
I genuinely care for you.

293
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:41,900
No matter what you've done to me before,

294
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:43,300
I can let it all go.

295
00:12:43,850 --> 00:12:46,120
Just tell me honestly what you're planning,

296
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:48,120
and I'll definitely help you.

297
00:12:49,220 --> 00:12:50,560
Why would you help me?

298
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:52,780
Just because you're my older sister

299
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,000
and I'm your younger sister?

300
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,600
How naive.

301
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:58,000
Once I enter the palace

302
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,760
and gain His Majesty's favor,

303
00:12:59,790 --> 00:13:02,150
I can be revered by thousands

304
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:04,070
and make everyone kneel before me.

305
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,460
What about you?

306
00:13:06,810 --> 00:13:08,000
Becoming someone's plaything,

307
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:09,200
will you be happy?

308
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:12,280
It doesn't matter who I sleep with.

309
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,140
They're all just men.

310
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,810
What the Empress Dowager hopes for

311
00:13:17,170 --> 00:13:19,150
or what Father wants to cling to

312
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:22,720
is nothing compared to what I can firmly grasp in my own hands.

313
00:13:23,230 --> 00:13:25,600
Trampling everyone underfoot—

314
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,000
that's what makes me happy.

315
00:13:30,920 --> 00:13:32,600
I'm starting to understand now

316
00:13:32,810 --> 00:13:34,820
how ridiculously wrong I was in my previous life.

317
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,120
I was just a child who put on

318
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:39,070
all the fancy clothes,

319
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,000
pretending to be an adult hiding my own vulnerability.

320
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:44,290
Xiyue,

321
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,850
whether you believe it or not,

322
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,180
whoever you want to marry,

323
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:49,460
I'll help you with it.

324
00:13:49,650 --> 00:13:51,800
Whether it's Pei Yan or Yun Yichen.

325
00:13:52,250 --> 00:13:53,550
If you want to be the Empress,

326
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:55,130
I'll help you fight for it.

327
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,020
Whether it's a prince or his father,

328
00:13:57,660 --> 00:13:59,100
they're just stepping stones for you.

329
00:13:59,130 --> 00:14:00,230
Are you crazy?

330
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,790
Don't be hypocritical with me.

331
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,040
I don't need it.

332
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,630
This Bai Xiyue

333
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:11,730
is even more driven by greed and desire than I was in my previous life.

334
00:14:12,680 --> 00:14:14,720
How can I stop her

335
00:14:14,850 --> 00:14:16,680
from falling into the abyss of evil?

336
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,100
This way, Lord Bai.

337
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,220
Greetings, Your Majesty.

338
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:28,040
Greetings, Your Highness.

339
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:31,140
You old fox,

340
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:32,790
I was going to do you a favor

341
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,300
by taking Bai Xiyue as a concubine.

342
00:14:34,430 --> 00:14:36,100
I didn't expect you to be such a traitor,

343
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:37,290
saying one thing and doing another!

344
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,930
You even sent that little vixen to seduce my father!

345
00:14:39,960 --> 00:14:41,310
I dare not, Your Highness.

346
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,480
His Majesty's interest in my daughter was entirely unexpected.

347
00:14:43,510 --> 00:14:44,670
The Empress Dowager was present at the time.

348
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:45,960
My daughter would never dare to overstep.

349
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,610
How could she possibly seduce His Majesty?

350
00:14:49,070 --> 00:14:50,420
Then how could Father

351
00:14:50,460 --> 00:14:51,630
treat a woman he just met

352
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:52,500
with such favor?

353
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:53,690
If she dares to enter the harem

354
00:14:53,710 --> 00:14:55,210
and compete with my mother for favor,

355
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:57,510
I'll kill you both

356
00:14:57,540 --> 00:14:59,520
and everyone in the Bai family!

357
00:14:59,690 --> 00:15:00,740
Si.

358
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:03,310
Do not be disrespectful to Lord Bai.

359
00:15:16,190 --> 00:15:17,750
Waiter, bring some wine.

360
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:22,470
Miss,

361
00:15:22,490 --> 00:15:23,800
you've already had quite a lot.

362
00:15:23,830 --> 00:15:24,530
Do you still want more?

363
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:25,390
Hurry up and bring it.

364
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,790
Are you afraid I can't pay the bill?

365
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:28,020
No, no.

366
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,910
I'll go get the wine.

367
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,370
Send a message to His Lordship.

368
00:15:40,390 --> 00:15:41,000
Yes, sir.

369
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:54,890
What are you running away from?

370
00:15:58,570 --> 00:15:59,870
I'm not running away from anything.

371
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:01,640
Can't you see I'm doing fine now?

372
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:02,930
I'm almost successful.

373
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:04,820
You've only extinguished half of my Karmic Fire.

374
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,790
And you've been avoiding Yun Yichen's feelings for you.

375
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,090
You're confused right now,

376
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:09,980
aren't you?
