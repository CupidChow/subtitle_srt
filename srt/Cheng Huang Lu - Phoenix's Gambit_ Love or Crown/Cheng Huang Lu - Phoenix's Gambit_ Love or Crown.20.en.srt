[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,790 --> 00:00:46,260
[Episode 20]

3
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,630
I can see it.

4
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:52,820
You're more ambitious than Xiyao,

5
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:55,410
and more ruthless in your methods.

6
00:00:56,230 --> 00:00:57,960
As a concubine's daughter,

7
00:00:57,980 --> 00:01:00,250
you'd never have had a chance to rise.

8
00:01:00,390 --> 00:01:03,190
But now that you've entered the palace as a consort,

9
00:01:03,190 --> 00:01:05,450
you have the opportunity to advance.

10
00:01:06,390 --> 00:01:10,770
The key is to gain His Majesty's favor.

11
00:01:11,039 --> 00:01:13,560
I'm doing all this for the Bai family.

12
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:16,860
As long as it keeps our family's position

13
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:18,280
unshakable in the court,

14
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:20,680
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

15
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:25,160
Those pretty words about filial piety and loyalty

16
00:01:25,160 --> 00:01:27,250
are just to appease your father.

17
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:31,580
If we women don't look out for ourselves,

18
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,229
we'll only end up as pawns to others.

19
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,140
She wants to rely on a woman's status to protect the Bai family.

20
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,380
It's ridiculous.

21
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:43,500
When has this world ever been influenced by women?

22
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:47,150
I understand.

23
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,190
This is our Bai family's ancestral secret medicine,

24
00:01:52,190 --> 00:01:53,700
Love-Slave Elixir.

25
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:54,979
It's extremely difficult to refine

26
00:01:54,979 --> 00:01:56,640
and hard to preserve for long.

27
00:01:56,660 --> 00:01:57,670
Use it

28
00:01:57,690 --> 00:01:59,390
on His Majesty,

29
00:01:59,420 --> 00:02:01,430
and he'll gradually

30
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:03,030
fall deeply in love with you

31
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,960
and be at your beck and call.

32
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,580
But won't this

33
00:02:10,660 --> 00:02:13,060
harm His Majesty's health?

34
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:15,040
He's held

35
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,270
that position for too long.

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,280
If he won't let Yan ascend,

37
00:02:20,310 --> 00:02:21,670
then we'll

38
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:24,190
let a Bai's descendant sit on the throne.

39
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,500
What are you thinking about, dear?

40
00:02:50,500 --> 00:02:52,030
You seem so lost in thought.

41
00:02:52,150 --> 00:02:54,180
How did I become your dear?

42
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,780
After our last conversation,

43
00:02:58,329 --> 00:02:59,320
I thought

44
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:02,230
you had agreed to be my Duchess.

45
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:04,470
But we

46
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,420
haven't...

47
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:07,210
haven't married yet, have we?

48
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:10,580
Miss Bai, are you in such a hurry?

49
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,580
Then let's get married in five days.

50
00:03:13,790 --> 00:03:15,080
So soon?

51
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,130
So willingly marrying Yun Yichen

52
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:26,490
can remove the karmic fire of marriage.

53
00:03:28,650 --> 00:03:31,650
Some things are better done sooner rather than later,

54
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,320
in case...

55
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:35,970
something big happens later,

56
00:03:35,990 --> 00:03:37,520
affecting my marrying you.

57
00:03:37,670 --> 00:03:38,730
Something big?

58
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,380
Could it be that in this life,

59
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:45,390
Yun Yichen will also help Pei Yan seize the throne?

60
00:03:54,680 --> 00:03:56,270
I'm so useless.

61
00:03:57,770 --> 00:03:59,090
I'm really useless.

62
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,610
Where's the wine?

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,140
Wine!

64
00:04:17,810 --> 00:04:20,040
Cousin, please don't be like this.

65
00:04:20,070 --> 00:04:21,269
Leave me alone!

66
00:04:21,779 --> 00:04:23,950
Pei Si is already the Crown Prince.

67
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:26,970
I don't want to fight for anything anymore.

68
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:28,560
Just let me be.

69
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:29,880
What about Xiyao?

70
00:04:29,900 --> 00:04:31,930
She's still waiting for you to lead her out of misery.

71
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,770
You need to pull yourself together.

72
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,320
I have nothing now.

73
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:39,900
I've let everyone down.

74
00:04:41,980 --> 00:04:43,159
I'm useless.

75
00:04:46,820 --> 00:04:48,659
You're not left with nothing.

76
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:50,690
You still have me.

77
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:53,159
I can make Yun Yichen

78
00:04:53,190 --> 00:04:54,640
lend you a hand.

79
00:04:54,670 --> 00:04:56,050
Yun Yichen?

80
00:04:57,930 --> 00:04:59,700
I wish I could kill him!

81
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,300
If you want to kill him,

82
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:06,870
why not use him before killing him?

83
00:05:07,100 --> 00:05:09,020
Taking everything from him

84
00:05:09,040 --> 00:05:11,570
would be the best punishment.

85
00:05:13,790 --> 00:05:15,100
How can we make him

86
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,990
willingly be used by me?

87
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,180
First,

88
00:05:18,210 --> 00:05:20,260
you need to facilitate Yun Yichen's

89
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:22,390
return to his hometown Luzhou for a family visit.

90
00:05:22,390 --> 00:05:23,540
What?

91
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:25,190
Let him have a chance

92
00:05:25,220 --> 00:05:27,670
to regain control of the old troops of Yun's Army.

93
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,330
You want me to help Yun Yichen leave the capital?

94
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:33,670
How can you guarantee he won't rebel?

95
00:05:33,770 --> 00:05:35,740
Because I have the ability

96
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:38,310
to make him obey my every word.

97
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:50,170
If something big is about to happen in the palace,

98
00:05:50,170 --> 00:05:52,500
I must discuss countermeasures with you.

99
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:53,880
Alright.

100
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:02,540
Hasn't he returned yet?

101
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,360
It's already this late.

102
00:06:13,010 --> 00:06:13,980
Oh no.

103
00:06:14,010 --> 00:06:15,440
It's the paralytic incense.

104
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:16,800
There's a trap here.

105
00:06:43,140 --> 00:06:44,200
Cousin Yan,

106
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:45,480
what are you doing?

107
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,370
Xiyao,

108
00:06:46,940 --> 00:06:48,050
don't be afraid.

109
00:06:48,540 --> 00:06:50,430
I'll treat you well for the rest of our lives.

110
00:06:50,430 --> 00:06:51,800
What do you mean?

111
00:06:51,950 --> 00:06:53,330
What are you going to do?

112
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,460
After tonight,

113
00:06:54,490 --> 00:06:56,420
I will tell the Empress Dowager and Father about us.

114
00:06:56,420 --> 00:06:57,510
No matter what,

115
00:06:57,570 --> 00:06:58,700
I will marry you.

116
00:06:58,700 --> 00:06:59,470
Cousin Yan,

117
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:00,800
don't do anything foolish.

118
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,540
I'm about to marry Yun Yichen.

119
00:07:02,570 --> 00:07:03,590
We can't be together.

120
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,540
I won't let you marry against your will.

121
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,210
Even if I can't be the Crown Prince,

122
00:07:07,210 --> 00:07:08,780
I'll still set you free.

123
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:12,970
I like...

124
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,610
I like Yun Yichen.

125
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:18,490
I'm willing to marry him.

126
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:20,220
Are you lying to me?

127
00:07:21,020 --> 00:07:23,220
How could you possibly like Yun Yichen?

128
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:24,990
It's true.

129
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:26,280
He likes me too.

130
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:28,310
We're in love with each other.

131
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,280
We've been hiding our feelings

132
00:07:30,410 --> 00:07:32,200
for fear of interference.

133
00:07:51,450 --> 00:07:54,100
No wonder since Yun Yichen returned to the capital,

134
00:07:54,100 --> 00:07:56,100
you've been much colder towards me.

135
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,800
So you've already

136
00:07:58,510 --> 00:08:00,110
been preparing to marry him.

137
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,230
Cousin Yan,

138
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:06,820
don't be misled by others.

139
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:09,330
I don't need anyone to save me,

140
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:11,930
nor can anyone force me to do anything.

141
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:14,200
I will control

142
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,770
my own life.

143
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,890
I see.

144
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:22,870
I'm sorry, Xiyao.

145
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,440
I'll escort you safely out of the palace

146
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,160
and back to the Bai Residence.

147
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:31,350
Please take me back to Qingzhi Pavilion instead.

148
00:08:31,730 --> 00:08:32,530
Alright.

149
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:39,159
I will leave the palace before curfew.

150
00:08:39,159 --> 00:08:42,070
We'll meet at Qingzhi Pavilion after the second watch.

151
00:08:42,070 --> 00:08:43,100
Why such a hurry?

152
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,100
I was planning to introduce you to Consort Xian.

153
00:08:49,430 --> 00:08:50,330
Be careful.

154
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,470
[Qingzhi Pavilion]

155
00:08:56,470 --> 00:08:57,350
Cousin Yan,

156
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:58,870
let's part here.

157
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:00,950
Let me help you inside to rest.

158
00:09:00,950 --> 00:09:01,820
No need,

159
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:03,250
I'm fine now.

160
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,730
You should return to the palace early

161
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:05,930
to avoid any trouble.

162
00:09:08,550 --> 00:09:10,310
I did something foolish today.

163
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,030
Whether you resent me

164
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:12,930
or hate me,

165
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,010
it doesn't matter.

166
00:09:14,950 --> 00:09:16,060
I only hope

167
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:18,760
that you can live by your own will.

168
00:09:21,180 --> 00:09:23,050
If you ever need me in the future,

169
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,820
I will surely protect you well.

170
00:09:24,840 --> 00:09:25,850
Cousin Yan,

171
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:28,490
I remember all the kindness you've shown me.

172
00:09:28,490 --> 00:09:29,770
I won't blame you.

173
00:09:31,060 --> 00:09:32,230
Just...

174
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:34,690
keep an eye on Xiyue for me.

175
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:36,890
Don't get into trouble

176
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:38,170
or cause any problems.

177
00:09:40,870 --> 00:09:42,670
I hope that the next time we meet,

178
00:09:43,010 --> 00:09:44,920
we can still be as open

179
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,530
and honest

180
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:47,990
as we were tonight.

181
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:50,650
De.

182
00:09:50,670 --> 00:09:51,060
Yes.

183
00:09:51,080 --> 00:09:52,070
See His Highness off.

184
00:09:52,070 --> 00:09:52,790
Yes.

185
00:09:54,290 --> 00:09:55,690
This way, Your Highness.

186
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:15,210
Why are you here?

187
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,870
Didn't you ask me to come here?

188
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,870
You get me here

189
00:10:19,900 --> 00:10:21,710
just to see you being all lovey-dovey

190
00:10:21,710 --> 00:10:23,010
with another man?

191
00:10:23,160 --> 00:10:25,240
What kind of anger is this?

192
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,800
The jealousy is too strong.

193
00:10:27,820 --> 00:10:29,240
Then do you want to

194
00:10:29,260 --> 00:10:30,870
be honest with me

195
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,010
and guess what I'm thinking?

196
00:10:33,750 --> 00:10:35,100
I can't guess that.

197
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:36,970
Then you can taste it.

198
00:10:40,900 --> 00:10:42,440
What exactly do you want?

199
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:44,530
Your scent,

200
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,970
the warmth of your lips,

201
00:10:46,030 --> 00:10:47,420
they all make me feel

202
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:49,300
a strange sense of familiarity.

203
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:53,020
Haven't we known each other since childhood?

204
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:54,140
That's different.

205
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,990
We were innocent as children.

206
00:10:55,990 --> 00:10:57,330
Back then, I only thought of you as

207
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:58,920
my closest playmate,

208
00:10:59,050 --> 00:11:01,080
a friend whose presence always brought joy.

209
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:02,310
As we grew up,

210
00:11:02,940 --> 00:11:05,900
I wondered what my feelings would be like

211
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:08,120
when we meet again,

212
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,510
What about now?

213
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,520
It's a burning desire,

214
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,650
an uncontrollable urge to be close to you,

215
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:20,220
to treasure you like a precious gem,

216
00:11:21,260 --> 00:11:22,860
to keep you hidden from others.

217
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:23,960
Please spare me.

218
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,850
I can't bear that.

219
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:31,930
Take this,

220
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:33,350
and stab me.

221
00:11:34,630 --> 00:11:36,270
Have you lost your mind?

222
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:39,300
I must hurry and return to my ancestral home in Luzhou.

223
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,740
What's the connection between them?

224
00:11:42,430 --> 00:11:45,160
The Emperor has always been wary of my Yun family.

225
00:11:45,310 --> 00:11:46,880
He split up the 300,000 Yun's Army

226
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,940
and scattered them across the state.

227
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,870
I've faced dangers at the border

228
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:53,620
and bided my time in the capital,

229
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:55,550
enduring and planning for so long,

230
00:11:55,630 --> 00:11:56,820
waiting for an opportunity

231
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,860
to reunite them.

232
00:11:59,790 --> 00:12:02,340
How could His Majesty easily let you leave the capital?

233
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:04,470
He must be monitoring your every move.

234
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,020
So

235
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,280
I need to make the Emperor believe

236
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:07,920
that we are at odds as a couple,

237
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:08,870
that you, in order to refuse the marriage,

238
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:09,970
have stabbed me,

239
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:11,950
leaving me on the brink of death.

240
00:12:11,990 --> 00:12:12,740
This way,

241
00:12:12,770 --> 00:12:15,480
he will feel at ease to allow me to return home for ancestral worship.

242
00:12:15,480 --> 00:12:17,320
You're paying such a high price.

243
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:18,800
What are you really after?

244
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:20,860
The death of my parents-

245
00:12:21,050 --> 00:12:22,980
the Emperor is the main culprit,

246
00:12:23,010 --> 00:12:25,040
and Noble Consort Li is his accomplice.

247
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,830
I want them dead.

248
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,700
So you'll send Yun's Army to surround the palace.

249
00:12:29,700 --> 00:12:30,740
And then?

250
00:12:30,850 --> 00:12:32,700
Will you claim the throne for yourself?

251
00:12:32,700 --> 00:12:34,760
I'm not interested in that position.

252
00:12:35,010 --> 00:12:36,670
As long as I can have my revenge,

253
00:12:36,670 --> 00:12:38,960
I don't care who becomes emperor.

254
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,990
If that's the case,

255
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:45,170
why not support a decent prince to take the throne?

256
00:12:45,280 --> 00:12:48,010
So you can preserve the reputation of Yun's Army.

257
00:12:48,410 --> 00:12:50,170
Don't tell me

258
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:54,410
you want me to help Pei Yan seize the throne.

259
00:12:55,640 --> 00:12:57,740
Rather than raising an army in rebellion

260
00:12:57,740 --> 00:12:59,400
and being labeled a regicide,

261
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,560
why not let them fight each other in the palace?

262
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:02,990
Your Yun's Army

263
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:05,510
can easily gain a reputation for loyalty to the crown.

264
00:13:05,510 --> 00:13:07,070
After the new emperor ascends the throne,

265
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,870
he will also be wary of Yun's Army

266
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:10,580
and won't dare to harbor ill intentions.

267
00:13:10,580 --> 00:13:12,750
Dear, you're so considerate of me.

268
00:13:12,950 --> 00:13:15,010
You truly are a wise and helpful wife.

269
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,600
However,

270
00:13:16,620 --> 00:13:19,010
if things are exposed,

271
00:13:19,140 --> 00:13:19,910
please

272
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:22,410
don't sacrifice yourself for me.

273
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:27,500
Xiyao,

274
00:13:27,530 --> 00:13:29,340
you're really ungrateful.

275
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:32,480
Turning down such a promising future.

276
00:13:33,210 --> 00:13:34,230
You refuse to be an imperial consort,

277
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,400
insisting on being a Duchess instead.

278
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:38,300
His Majesty has arrived.

279
00:13:38,500 --> 00:13:39,870
Get ready to welcome His Majesty.

280
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:41,360
Yes, Your Highness.

281
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,330
Why do you have to do this?

282
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:57,510
You feel sorry for me?

283
00:13:58,670 --> 00:13:59,870
If you die,

284
00:14:00,430 --> 00:14:03,090
I won't be able to explain it to the authorities.

285
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:04,490
That's true.

286
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:05,540
Murdering one's husband

287
00:14:05,540 --> 00:14:06,740
is a capital offense.

288
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:08,760
We're not married yet.

289
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:10,170
Don't drag me into this.

290
00:14:11,230 --> 00:14:14,040
That would still be a crime of adultery.

291
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,720
It's punishable by drowning.

292
00:14:17,470 --> 00:14:18,900
I'm innocent.

293
00:14:18,920 --> 00:14:20,550
I did not have an affair with a strange man.

294
00:14:20,550 --> 00:14:22,030
I'm innocent!

295
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,120
Why is it that you men

296
00:14:26,120 --> 00:14:28,520
can deceive women with sweet words and promises,

297
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:30,660
but in the end, women have to suffer

298
00:14:30,690 --> 00:14:32,370
for the sake of their virtues,

299
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,950
or even lose their lives?

300
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:37,740
Is it wrong to love someone?

301
00:14:37,770 --> 00:14:39,500
Betraying someone's true heart is wrong!
