[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:46,380
[Episode 24]

3
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,490
You're Bai Xiyao and no one else,

4
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:52,150
right?

5
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:54,530
What exactly do you want to ask?

6
00:00:54,530 --> 00:00:55,290
I mean,

7
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,710
you're not a disciple of Yuanhuang Palace,

8
00:00:56,710 --> 00:00:58,420
nor have you learned any magic.

9
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,930
I don't know what you're talking about.

10
00:00:59,930 --> 00:01:01,990
Where is the original Bai Xiyue?

11
00:01:02,060 --> 00:01:03,690
Her soul still resides in this body, right?

12
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:04,580
Only I

13
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:06,320
don't belong to anyone's body.

14
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:08,250
What's the use of knowing all this?

15
00:01:08,330 --> 00:01:10,020
I'm determined to end my life.

16
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:11,700
Even if I were to reborn into a new life,

17
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:13,300
it wouldn't bring me any joy.

18
00:01:14,950 --> 00:01:16,510
Now that you think it's meaningless,

19
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:17,780
then let me have

20
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:20,380
the experiences I couldn't have in the previous two lives.

21
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:21,530
[Harmony]

22
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:47,940
Go help them now!

00:01:49,410 --> 00:01:52,150
[Harmony]

24
00:01:53,270 --> 00:01:54,070
Xiyao.

25
00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:54,979
Xiyao!

26
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:57,990
[Harmony]

27
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:09,570
We've switched back.

28
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:44,900
Where do you think you're going?

29
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:47,300
You're a serious criminal and an exile now.

30
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,040
I'm also guilty of attempting to murder my husband.

31
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,350
Kill me now.

32
00:02:55,950 --> 00:02:56,890
Murder?

33
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:02,810
You just gave me a new wound.

34
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:05,440
Do you really think you could take my life?

35
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:09,790
Are you acknowledging that I'm your wife?

36
00:03:12,770 --> 00:03:13,780
Of course you are.

37
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,770
I'm the one who got hurt.

38
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:26,810
Why are you the one crying?

39
00:03:28,230 --> 00:03:30,290
I thought you had abandoned me.

40
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,040
How could that be possible?

41
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:40,300
I promised to spend the rest of my life with you.

42
00:03:42,650 --> 00:03:45,550
Then why did you never visit me in the prison?

43
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,750
Because I knew she wasn't you.

44
00:03:51,490 --> 00:03:52,700
How did you know that?

45
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:55,990
When she lifted her veil and attempted to assassinate me,

46
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,720
I figured out she wasn't you.

47
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:02,200
She wasn't the girl I'm familiar with.

48
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:05,080
There was only resentment and hatred

49
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,070
in her eyes,

50
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:09,760
instead of love.

51
00:04:12,340 --> 00:04:13,420
After that,

52
00:04:13,790 --> 00:04:16,160
I had my people keep watch on her.

53
00:04:16,750 --> 00:04:18,250
I was sure she didn't use

54
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:20,709
any tricks of disguise,

55
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:23,000
but I had no idea how she made that happen,

56
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:25,500
until today.

57
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:28,260
You two...

58
00:04:29,810 --> 00:04:31,810
You two have switched souls, right?

59
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:34,820
Yes.

60
00:04:35,890 --> 00:04:38,350
We've exchanged our divine consciousness.

61
00:04:41,710 --> 00:04:43,409
I'm not a mortal,

62
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:46,300
but a reincarnated celestial being.

63
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,450
This is the third time that our lives have been entangled.

64
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,030
Go help them!

65
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:54,900
Bai Xiyao!

66
00:04:54,930 --> 00:04:55,640
Xiyao!

67
00:04:58,380 --> 00:04:59,090
Hey!

68
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:07,120
You faint every time you use celestial power, right?

69
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:09,660
The last time you fainted,

70
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,290
you had just used celestial power to save me, was that so?

71
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,550
Yes.

72
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:18,720
Well...

73
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:21,550
What other challenges are awaiting us?

74
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,490
Will you leave me

75
00:05:22,510 --> 00:05:24,040
when they are all overcome?

76
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:28,880
Regardless of our past lives

77
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:31,330
and the future,

78
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:36,630
I only want to be with you

79
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:38,400
in this life.

80
00:05:57,210 --> 00:05:59,740
Prince Yi had this delivered to Your Majesty.

81
00:06:06,270 --> 00:06:08,290
Yun Yichen actually

82
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:12,460
forfeited his military power for Xiyao's sake.

83
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:22,280
Because the Yun family

84
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:24,880
has something that could overthrow his power.

85
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:29,080
The Pei family ruled the country for 100 years.

86
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,790
Then, the Yun family took the throne.

87
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:32,320
The alliance between the two families

88
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:33,940
will never be broken.

89
00:06:33,970 --> 00:06:36,170
You're doing all this because of her...

90
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:51,170
I'm eager for a drink.

91
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:54,920
I want a drink now!

92
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:02,620
Last year...

93
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,500
By the Phoenix Pool,

94
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:09,160
a candle was lit and songs were played.

95
00:07:09,650 --> 00:07:10,500
Good.

96
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:13,890
Where is the person I used to admire the moon with?

97
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:17,490
The scenery isn't much different from last year.

98
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,370
I'll get Your Majesty a drink then.

99
00:07:24,340 --> 00:07:25,620
Forget it.

100
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,720
Tidy up the place.

101
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,600
I have so many important things to do.

102
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:32,750
Yes.

103
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:58,409
I wish you happiness.

104
00:08:15,130 --> 00:08:16,070
I'm sorry!

105
00:08:16,090 --> 00:08:18,220
I beg for Your Majesty's forgiveness!

106
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:24,130
I am the Empress.

107
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:27,600
I am the Empress now!

108
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:30,000
What's going on, Your Highness?

109
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,630
Are you feeling unwell?

110
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,990
I... I'll go get the imperial physicians.

111
00:08:34,409 --> 00:08:35,409
Run for your life!

112
00:08:35,940 --> 00:08:37,340
She's coming here for human flesh.

113
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,340
She's going to eat me!

114
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:40,820
I can't let that happen!

115
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:41,780
Your Majesty...

116
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:44,039
Prince Regent has given an order.

117
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:46,040
Your Majesty must stay here

118
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:48,600
since you're pregnant.

119
00:08:49,290 --> 00:08:50,550
Let me out!

120
00:08:51,060 --> 00:08:52,480
I am the Empress!

121
00:08:52,500 --> 00:08:53,770
Let me out!

122
00:08:54,610 --> 00:08:55,670
Xiyao...

123
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,860
Your Majesty.

124
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,150
Your Majesty...

125
00:08:58,730 --> 00:08:59,950
-Come here now, Xiyao!
-Your Majesty.

126
00:08:59,950 --> 00:09:01,050
Xiyao!

127
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:03,850
-Come to my rescue, Xiyao!
-Your Majesty...

128
00:09:04,730 --> 00:09:06,460
What's going on, Your Majesty?

129
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:08,140
You're not Xiyao!

130
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,380
Stay away from me!

131
00:09:11,410 --> 00:09:12,610
Don't eat me!

132
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:13,770
I beg you!

133
00:09:13,790 --> 00:09:15,110
Don't come any closer!

134
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,080
Don't eat me!

135
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:19,010
Xiyao, help me!

136
00:09:19,030 --> 00:09:19,710
Your Highness.

137
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:20,750
Xiyao!

138
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:23,440
Are you feeling cold?

139
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:27,720
Not at all.

140
00:09:29,060 --> 00:09:30,710
The Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, isn't it?

141
00:09:30,710 --> 00:09:31,240
Yes.

142
00:09:32,410 --> 00:09:33,550
Do you want to go to the lantern fair?

143
00:09:33,550 --> 00:09:34,630
It should be fun.

144
00:09:36,010 --> 00:09:36,970
No.

145
00:09:37,700 --> 00:09:39,490
I just want to stay with you.

146
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:41,660
As much fun as there is outside,

147
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,570
I prefer the time we spend together.

148
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:04,550
Fireworks.

149
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:06,740
Look, it's so beautiful.

150
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:11,830
Yes. How beautiful.

151
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:16,410
I meant the fireworks.

152
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:17,440
And I meant you.

153
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:20,290
The fireworks tonight

154
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,160
are prettier because of you.

155
00:10:42,590 --> 00:10:45,430
Bai Hong, aren't you going to give up?

156
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:47,760
I'm still hanging in there.

157
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:49,770
You made me a promise, didn't you?

158
00:10:49,790 --> 00:10:51,740
As long as the fire hasn't killed me,

159
00:10:51,740 --> 00:10:53,920
I can still stay with him.

160
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:04,860
In the challenge of "fame,"

161
00:11:04,890 --> 00:11:06,680
you became more assertive

162
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:08,190
with a stronger will

163
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:10,100
that it wouldn't be affected by external factors.

164
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:12,030
In the challenge of "friendship,"

165
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,910
you gained real friendship

166
00:11:14,250 --> 00:11:15,390
and a true friend

167
00:11:15,410 --> 00:11:17,620
who was like the sister you had never had.

168
00:11:17,620 --> 00:11:19,240
She gave you strength.

169
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,610
In the challenge of "family,"

170
00:11:21,670 --> 00:11:23,690
you actually found your family back.

171
00:11:23,690 --> 00:11:26,560
Whether your family members loved you

172
00:11:26,590 --> 00:11:27,860
or treated you badly,

173
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:31,640
you still showed respect to them in the way you saw fit

174
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,160
without hatred or resentment.

175
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,490
In the challenge of "marriage,"

176
00:11:36,510 --> 00:11:38,590
you plucked up courage to defy the norms

177
00:11:38,590 --> 00:11:41,840
and to take control of your own marriage.

178
00:11:42,210 --> 00:11:44,140
In the challenge of "power,"

179
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:45,880
you gained power

180
00:11:45,950 --> 00:11:48,420
and understood the meaning of it.

181
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:50,490
In the challenge of "sister,"

182
00:11:50,540 --> 00:11:52,670
the Bai sisters, as the good and bad sides

183
00:11:52,670 --> 00:11:56,440
of you, all merged into your divine consciousness.

184
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:59,080
The last and seventh challenge

185
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,450
is about love.

186
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:04,370
You're required to forsake romance

187
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,040
and become immune

188
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:07,550
to its effects.

189
00:12:07,570 --> 00:12:10,060
Then, no emotion can ever bother you.

190
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:13,700
At that time, as my avatar that has been through enough challenges,

191
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:17,330
you will become Bai Hong Immortal.

192
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:21,140
Immortal Master,

193
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,050
can I give up on that chance?

194
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,090
I just want to be a mortal

195
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,990
and to spend the rest of my life

196
00:12:28,990 --> 00:12:30,270
with the man I love.

197
00:12:30,300 --> 00:12:31,880
It's not that easy.

198
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:33,580
There is too much celestial power in you.

199
00:12:33,580 --> 00:12:35,150
The Karmic Fire is burning.

200
00:12:35,270 --> 00:12:37,020
If you are to give up now,

201
00:12:37,150 --> 00:12:38,470
you'll bear the consequences

202
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:40,070
of quitting.

203
00:12:40,960 --> 00:12:42,820
I'd like to give it a try.

204
00:12:43,180 --> 00:12:44,150
Fine.

205
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:46,630
I'll reignite the Karmic Fire from your three former lives.

206
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:48,430
You shall resist it with celestial power.

207
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,670
When the fire dies out,

208
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:51,780
you'll live.

209
00:12:51,800 --> 00:12:54,520
When you're out of celestial power and get burned by the fire,

210
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,450
you'll die.

211
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,620
Do you accept that?

212
00:12:57,640 --> 00:12:59,500
I'm sorry I've disappointed you.

213
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,780
Immortal Master, please

214
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,980
get it started now.

215
00:13:05,170 --> 00:13:05,970
Very well.

216
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:07,510
I will

217
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:09,360
give you want you asked for.

218
00:13:19,130 --> 00:13:20,320
♫Yearning♫

219
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,050
♫A thousand times♫

220
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:25,470
♫Old feelings linger, sleepless again♫

221
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,340
♫Worldly matters♫

222
00:13:27,950 --> 00:13:29,060
♫Like smoke♫

223
00:13:30,150 --> 00:13:32,980
♫Gradually blurring fond attachment♫

224
00:13:33,280 --> 00:13:34,380
♫Facing each other♫

225
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:36,180
♫In silence♫

226
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:39,620
♫Only regret lingers in our hearts♫

227
00:13:40,270 --> 00:13:41,420
♫Burning the zither♫

228
00:13:42,050 --> 00:13:43,010
♫Strings broken♫

229
00:13:44,170 --> 00:13:47,880
♫Prayers echo, no one plays it across three lives♫

230
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:48,790
I'm not

231
00:13:48,790 --> 00:13:50,660
♫In a single thought♫

232
00:13:50,660 --> 00:13:52,090
crashing yet.

233
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,350
♫In a single thought♫

234
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,360
♫Is it love or hate♫

235
00:13:56,760 --> 00:13:58,760
♫It's all just the mortal world♫

236
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:01,570
♫Life after life, like snow♫

237

♫Love falls♫

238

♫Unreturned♫

239
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:12,930
Look. Isn't it a big fish?

240
00:14:12,930 --> 00:14:14,310
You're amazing!

241
00:14:17,490 --> 00:14:19,050
I'll catch some soft-shell turtles

242
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:20,770
for Your Highness!

243
00:14:21,930 --> 00:14:25,240
A century-old giant soft-shell turtle is said to live in this lake.

244
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:26,530
Be careful. You might be caught by it

245
00:14:26,530 --> 00:14:27,720
and become its lunch.

246
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:28,350
Listen,

247
00:14:28,380 --> 00:14:29,010
maybe

248
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,640
it's time we called it quits.

249
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:32,720
We've got enough fish and shrimp already.

250
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:33,520
Okay.

251
00:14:38,920 --> 00:14:40,540
He was just fooling you.

252
00:14:40,830 --> 00:14:42,800
There are no giant soft-shelled turtles in the lake.

253
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:43,980
If there really were,

254
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,690
then I must've been saved by one of them

255
00:14:45,690 --> 00:14:47,510
when I fell into the water years ago.

256
00:14:47,510 --> 00:14:49,240
This is uncalled for, isn't it?

257
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:51,030
I saved you at that time. I was a hero,

258
00:14:51,030 --> 00:14:52,450
not a turtle.

259
00:14:52,530 --> 00:14:55,850
Alright, alright, whatever you said, hero.

260
00:14:57,340 --> 00:14:58,170
My Lady,

261
00:14:58,190 --> 00:15:00,720
the Second Miss hanged herself in the palace.

262
00:15:02,770 --> 00:15:04,300
Bai Xiyue is dead?

263
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:18,300
[May you find your love and be with them in perpetuity. Wish you a safe and peaceful life.]
[The End]
