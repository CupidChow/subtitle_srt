[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,380
[Episode 19]

3
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,540
She's gone?

4
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:49,220
This is defying the imperial edict.

5
00:00:49,220 --> 00:00:50,740
Father didn't let her leave.

6
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,070
He didn't let her go out.

7
00:00:52,250 --> 00:00:54,510
That's why I disguised myself as her

8
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
to seek help from you, Cousin Yan.

9
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:58,780
I've just been released from confinement.

10
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,440
So many things have happened.

11
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:02,070
I was originally going to plead with the Empress Dowager too

12
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:03,220
to dissolve Xiyao's engagement.

13
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,550
We've already been to the palace to plead.

14
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:07,210
The Empress Dowager....

15
00:01:07,380 --> 00:01:09,930
I'm afraid the Empress Dowager no longer wants to intervene in Xiyao's affairs.

16
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,170
How can that be?

17
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,200
Grandmother loves Xiyao the most.

18
00:01:14,230 --> 00:01:16,700
To avoid marrying Prince Yi,

19
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,030
Xiyao has already asked the Empress Dowager

20
00:01:18,030 --> 00:01:20,210
for permission to leave for spiritual cultivation.

21
00:01:20,210 --> 00:01:21,610
She wants to become a nun.

22
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:23,039
What should we do now?

23
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:25,670
Why don't I go talk to Prince Yi?

24
00:01:25,670 --> 00:01:27,140
He's unwilling too, isn't he?

25
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:29,789
Prince Yi has deep feelings for me.

26
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,450
But fate has played a cruel trick.

27
00:01:31,450 --> 00:01:34,039
Ever since he learned I was summoned to the palace,

28
00:01:34,039 --> 00:01:36,410
he's been treating Xiyao as my substitute.

29
00:01:36,410 --> 00:01:37,660
He's frustrated inside.

30
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:39,370
He often harasses Xiyao.

31
00:01:41,479 --> 00:01:43,100
This is Xiyao's personal maid,

32
00:01:43,100 --> 00:01:43,979
Lianxin.

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,560
You tell him.

34
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:46,990
I recognize you.

35
00:01:47,009 --> 00:01:47,950
Speak quickly.

36
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,610
Your Highness,

37
00:01:49,630 --> 00:01:52,910
Prince Yi asked me about Lady Xiyao's preferences.

38
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:55,009
He said he wanted to prepare a generous betrothal gift.

39
00:01:55,009 --> 00:01:56,950
Prince Yi often sends messages,

40
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,820
saying he wants to meet with Lady Xiyao.

41
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:02,280
It seems he's determined to fulfill this marriage agreement.

42
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:05,760
The only person who can save Xiyao from this predicament now

43
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,950
is you, Cousin Yan.

44
00:02:09,740 --> 00:02:10,970
What should I do?

45
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:14,950
I will soon enter the palace,

46
00:02:15,050 --> 00:02:17,310
and I'll bring Xiyao with me at that time.

47
00:02:21,860 --> 00:02:23,380
I knew she couldn't stay idle.

48
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:24,730
Just be a good consort,

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,090
why bother me?

50
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:28,980
My Lady, you must be careful.

51
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:31,300
Prince Yan has also been bewitched by her.

52
00:02:31,300 --> 00:02:31,790
It's

53
00:02:31,810 --> 00:02:34,210
very likely that they will act against you.

54
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:37,780
It's alright.

55
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,370
Now that we know what she's planning to do,

56
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:43,720
the important thing is not to guard against her anymore,

57
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:45,380
but how to use them

58
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:47,079
to do things that benefit us.

59
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:51,620
Mr. Chen.

60
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,230
Where are we going?

61
00:02:53,260 --> 00:02:54,590
According to the rules,

62
00:02:55,210 --> 00:02:58,270
Consort Hui should first pay respects to the Empress Dowager.

63
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:01,130
However, from the east side gate to Cining Palace,

64
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:03,330
we need to pass through Noble Consort Li's Huaying Palace.

65
00:03:03,330 --> 00:03:03,970
So,

66
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,830
we should pay a visit first.

67
00:03:07,820 --> 00:03:09,730
The Empress Dowager is waiting for us.

68
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:11,490
If we detour to Huaying Palace first,

69
00:03:11,490 --> 00:03:13,950
I'm afraid we'll be delayed by another hour.

70
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:17,960
Mr. Chen,

71
00:03:18,380 --> 00:03:20,870
let's go through the Qinghe Gate from the Imperial Garden.

72
00:03:20,870 --> 00:03:23,690
Although it's a bit of a detour to reach Cining Palace,

73
00:03:23,690 --> 00:03:24,870
the Empress Dowager

74
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,470
won't blame us sisters.

75
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:28,480
The main thing is,

76
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:29,170
by going this way,

77
00:03:29,170 --> 00:03:31,320
we won't pass through Huaying Palace's territory.

78
00:03:31,320 --> 00:03:33,140
In case Noble Consort Li takes offense,

79
00:03:33,140 --> 00:03:35,010
at least we'll have an explanation.

80
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,030
Miss Bai, you're truly clever.

81
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,750
This way, we won't offend either side,

82
00:03:38,750 --> 00:03:41,060
and I can also remain blameless.

83
00:03:42,329 --> 00:03:43,130
Let's go.

84
00:03:49,960 --> 00:03:51,100
Your Highness.

85
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:51,420
This...

86
00:03:51,420 --> 00:03:52,520
In my previous life,

87
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:54,850
Noble Consort Li gave me no end of trouble.

88
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:03,780
This servant pays respects to

89
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:05,120
Your Highness.

90
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:11,500
Which palace are you from?

91
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,160
Her Highness is here.

92
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:15,020
Why don't you come to pay respects?

93
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,610
Your Highness,

94
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:19,600
this is Consort Hui who has just entered the palace.

95
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,230
Consort Hui?

96
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:23,410
What Consort Hui?

97
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,700
I've never heard of her.

98
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:33,420
I am Bai Xiyue, the second daughter of the Bai family from the Minister's Mansion.

99
00:04:33,420 --> 00:04:35,010
I am grateful for His Majesty's favor.

100
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:36,330
I feel truly honored.

101
00:04:36,650 --> 00:04:38,560
Mr. Chen was about to escort me

102
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:41,250
to Huaying Palace to pay respects to Your Highness.

103
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:42,330
Liar.

104
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:44,490
This is not the way to Huaying Palace.

105
00:04:44,630 --> 00:04:46,690
It's clearly the path to Qinghe Gate.

106
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:48,600
I was eager to arrive,

107
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,030
and took a wrong turn.

108
00:04:50,150 --> 00:04:52,090
Fortunately, Mr. Chen reminded me,

109
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:53,590
and I was about to change direction

110
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:55,740
when I fortunately encountered Your Highness.

111
00:04:55,740 --> 00:04:57,860
It seems heaven has shown me favor.

112
00:04:58,150 --> 00:05:00,840
If I had gone to Huaying Palace first,

113
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:05,410
I'm afraid I wouldn't have had the chance to pay my respects to Your Highness.

114
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:08,110
What a glib tongue you have.

115
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:10,340
Since you're here to pay respects,

116
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:12,040
come and serve me a cup of tea.

117
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:14,110
Yes, Your Highness.

118
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,280
Receive it on your knees.

119
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,610
Boil some fresh water.

120
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,390
New tea for the newcomer.

121
00:05:41,610 --> 00:05:42,960
When brewing tea,

122
00:05:42,990 --> 00:05:44,400
you should use spring water.

123
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,980
Spring water is pure and crisp,

124
00:05:45,980 --> 00:05:47,440
but it has a mineral taste.

125
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:50,170
To remove this earthy flavor,

126
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:51,730
you need to boil it longer.

127
00:05:59,810 --> 00:06:01,170
Your Highness,

128
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:03,210
my father also enjoys tea tasting.

129
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:04,330
In the Minister's Mansion,

130
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:04,840
there is a canister of

131
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,630
late spring mature tea from thousand-year-old tea trees on Mang Mountain.

132
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:11,230
If Your Highness doesn't mind,

133
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:13,490
I would like to offer it to you as a gift.

134
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,170
The water is boiling, hurry and brew the tea.

135
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:20,420
The Empress Dowager is waiting.

136
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:24,720
Thank you for your understanding, Your Highness.

137
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:41,960
Pour it full.

138
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:46,200
So I can feel Consort Hui's sincerity.

139
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:52,770
That's enough.

140
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:58,670
Xiyue pays respects to Great-aunt Empress Dowager.

141
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:03,380
Greetings to Your Highness Empress Dowager.

142
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:09,480
As my great-niece,

143
00:07:09,600 --> 00:07:11,520
you may perform this grand gesture.

144
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,220
But as His Majesty's consort,

145
00:07:14,530 --> 00:07:16,910
a half-kneeling bow will suffice.

146
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:18,780
You don't need to kneel.

147
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,990
Isn't that right, Noble Consort Li?

148
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,440
The Empress Dowager's admonition is correct.

149
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:28,530
However, I don't know why Consort Hui

150
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,420
performed such a grand ceremony.

151
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,290
She must not be very familiar with

152
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,570
the palace rules yet.

153
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:35,040
In the future,

154
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:37,590
I will teach her properly.

155
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,030
Noble Consort Li,

156
00:07:44,050 --> 00:07:47,420
although you are now in charge of the six palaces,

157
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:50,070
you are still not the Empress.

158
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,580
As someone who has been through it all,

159
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:54,110
let me give you some advice.

160
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,680
If you want to be a good Empress,

161
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,890
you must have a tolerant heart.

162
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,390
The Emperor's heart is hard to fathom,

163
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,210
and no one can monopolize it.

164
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:04,710
Harmony in the harem

165
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:08,260
and ensuring royal succession are the most important matters.

166
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:09,590
I will remember this.

167
00:08:10,340 --> 00:08:11,930
Thank you for your trouble, Empress Dowager,

168
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:12,810
for coming here specially

169
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:14,270
to teach me the rules.

170
00:08:15,250 --> 00:08:18,250
I shall take my leave now.

171
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:23,820
I take my leave, Your Highness.

172
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,790
Quickly thank Great-aunt.

173
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,000
Thank you, Great-aunt, for supporting me.

174
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:37,919
You two,

175
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,929
come back to the palace with me.

176
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:53,230
The women of the Bai family

177
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:54,890
are indeed all very annoying.

178
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:55,890
Your Highness,

179
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:57,410
don't let that little wretch

180
00:08:57,410 --> 00:08:59,120
upset you and harm your health.

181
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,180
Keep an eye on that Bai family's eldest daughter.

182
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:04,390
I've heard some rumors about her during the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

183
00:09:04,390 --> 00:09:05,730
Now Prince Yan

184
00:09:06,090 --> 00:09:08,490
and Prince Yi are both infatuated with her.

185
00:09:08,840 --> 00:09:11,170
She's definitely not a simple noble lady.

186
00:09:11,840 --> 00:09:13,500
I understand, Your Highness.

187
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,670
If I had known this would happen,

188
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:21,730
I should have listened to Xiyao back then.

189
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:24,730
At least the Bai family would still have a glimmer of hope.

190
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:25,920
Tell me,

191
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:28,310
is this your father's idea

192
00:09:28,330 --> 00:09:30,830
or your own scheme?

193
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:32,700
Great-aunt,

194
00:09:32,730 --> 00:09:35,110
I truly don't know why I was summoned to the palace

195
00:09:35,110 --> 00:09:36,310
and received His Majesty's favor.

196
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,870
If it was your own plan,

197
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:40,200
then I

198
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,310
would think more highly of you.

199
00:09:42,850 --> 00:09:44,010
Perhaps

200
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,280
I could even help you maneuver a bit.

201
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:49,090
Great-aunt,

202
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,240
perhaps Noble Consort Li is behind this,

203
00:09:53,270 --> 00:09:55,470
intending to humiliate our Bai family.

204
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:58,480
What Xiyao says is possible.

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,780
Since you've already entered the palace,

206
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:04,050
then as you wish,

207
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:06,440
stay by my side

208
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:07,750
to avoid marriage.

209
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,710
Great-aunt,

210
00:10:09,980 --> 00:10:11,020
I

211
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:12,800
am willing to marry Prince Yi.

212
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:14,430
Nonsense!

213
00:10:14,450 --> 00:10:15,750
When it comes to marriage,

214
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,900
how dare you go back on your word?

215
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,890
Are you trying to make a fool of me?

216
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,750
Please calm down, Great-aunt.

217
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:25,230
If I don't marry Prince Yi,

218
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:26,390
Noble Consort Li

219
00:10:26,410 --> 00:10:27,530
will certainly still be wary of

220
00:10:27,530 --> 00:10:29,500
the Bai family's marriage alliance with Cousin Yan.

221
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:31,860
Who knows what sinister schemes she might employ

222
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:33,240
against our Bai family.

223
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,870
Now that Xiyue has entered the palace,

224
00:10:37,070 --> 00:10:38,210
Noble Consort Li

225
00:10:38,230 --> 00:10:40,660
will surely think she can manipulate Xiyue.

226
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:42,670
When they believe victory is within their grasp

227
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:44,230
and let their guard down,

228
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:45,710
I will go and persuade Prince Yi

229
00:10:45,710 --> 00:10:47,270
to support Prince Yan.

230
00:10:47,410 --> 00:10:49,300
Xiyue will work from within, with His Majesty,

231
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:50,870
while we coordinate from the outside.

232
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:51,890
This way,

233
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,340
whether Prince Yan becomes Crown Prince

234
00:10:54,460 --> 00:10:56,630
or Xiyue gains imperial favor,

235
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:58,810
the situation will be advantageous for the Bai family.

236
00:10:58,810 --> 00:10:59,690
By then,

237
00:10:59,710 --> 00:11:00,980
no matter who becomes Empress,

238
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:03,160
it will be in the bag for our Bai family.

239
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:08,140
I will not disappoint you, Great-aunt.

240
00:11:11,750 --> 00:11:13,910
Endure in silence,

241
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:16,210
and wait for the right moment to act.

242
00:11:17,370 --> 00:11:20,230
Well done, feigning weakness to deceive the enemy.

243
00:11:20,510 --> 00:11:21,840
You may rise.

244
00:11:24,090 --> 00:11:24,890
Xiyao,

245
00:11:24,920 --> 00:11:26,750
go to my private treasury

246
00:11:26,780 --> 00:11:29,170
and bring a set of ceremonial bridal attire.

247
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:32,000
It will be your wedding dress.

248
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:34,100
Yes, Great-aunt.

249
00:11:37,480 --> 00:11:38,520
Xiyue.

250
00:11:43,950 --> 00:11:47,280
Even if it costs me my position as Consort Xian,

251
00:11:47,310 --> 00:11:48,770
I will help you break off the engagement.

252
00:11:48,770 --> 00:11:49,460
Aunt,

253
00:11:49,490 --> 00:11:51,270
I have no intention of breaking off the engagement.

254
00:11:51,270 --> 00:11:53,470
In fact, as the wedding day approaches,

255
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,040
I've come to seek your guidance.

256
00:11:56,710 --> 00:11:57,960
I thought

257
00:11:57,980 --> 00:12:00,400
you would find a way to refuse this marriage.

258
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:02,240
How come now you seem

259
00:12:02,260 --> 00:12:03,570
to be so willing?

260
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,060
Bai Xiyue has always been the one I desire.

261
00:12:06,820 --> 00:12:08,080
Earlier in the palace,

262
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:11,020
I was merely acting contrary to my true feelings.

263
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,800
I see.

264
00:12:13,020 --> 00:12:13,920
Yichen,

265
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:15,970
you've finally found someone you truly care for.

266
00:12:15,970 --> 00:12:17,300
I am happy for you.

267
00:12:18,750 --> 00:12:22,400
It's a pity my sister and brother-in-law are no longer with us.

268
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,660
And due to my position,

269
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:27,340
I won't be able to attend your wedding ceremony.

270
00:12:29,210 --> 00:12:30,300
Aunt,

271
00:12:30,820 --> 00:12:32,290
I have found someone I care for.

272
00:12:32,290 --> 00:12:34,070
You should be happy, shouldn't you?

273
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:35,630
I will surely be happy.

274
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,020
Good.

275
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,200
When the time comes, I

276
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:43,130
will certainly prepare a generous gift for you both.

277
00:12:43,210 --> 00:12:44,100
I'd like

278
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:45,920
to take advantage of this wedding

279
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,710
to accomplish another matter.

280
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:49,340
I hope you can help me with this, Aunt.

281
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:50,250
What do you want to do?

282
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,400
Just tell me,

283
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:53,190
and I'll make sure it happens.

284
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:54,450
Before the wedding,

285
00:12:54,470 --> 00:12:56,400
I want to return to our ancestral home in Luzhou to pay respects to our ancestors,

286
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:58,130
to comfort the spirits of the Yun family ancestors,

287
00:12:58,130 --> 00:12:59,880
and to repair my parents' tombs.

288
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:02,480
Emotionally, this is the right thing to do.

289
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:03,970
But logically,

290
00:13:04,280 --> 00:13:07,110
His Majesty won't easily allow you to leave the capital,

291
00:13:07,110 --> 00:13:09,190
especially to go to your hometown in Luzhou.

292
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:10,930
That's why I need an opportunity

293
00:13:10,930 --> 00:13:12,390
to make His Majesty believe

294
00:13:12,390 --> 00:13:14,500
that I no longer pose a threat.

295
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:16,970
Yichen,

296
00:13:17,720 --> 00:13:19,890
do you have other plans?

297
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:22,660
To be honest with you, Aunt,

298
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:24,210
since I returned to the capital,

299
00:13:24,210 --> 00:13:25,800
I've been keeping a low profile.

300
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:28,020
The Yun's Army at the border has been quietly relocated.

301
00:13:28,020 --> 00:13:29,680
Once we rendezvous in Luzhou,

302
00:13:29,970 --> 00:13:31,240
I can

303
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,990
reclaim everything the Yun family has lost.

304
00:13:32,990 --> 00:13:33,690
I'll settle old scores

305
00:13:33,690 --> 00:13:34,350
and take revenge.

306
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,360
You're not...

307
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,960
Yes.

308
00:13:41,140 --> 00:13:41,900
Good.

309
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,240
As expected of a man of the Yun family.

310
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,970
Go ahead with your plans.

311
00:13:47,220 --> 00:13:48,100
I will

312
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,920
support you with all my might.

313
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:51,720
Alright.

314
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:57,860
The Empress Dowager sent me away.

315
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,000
Could it be...

316
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:04,110
The Emperor still wants to make Pei Si the Crown Prince.

317
00:14:04,130 --> 00:14:07,230
He thinks Yan is too soft-natured

318
00:14:07,250 --> 00:14:09,250
and lacks the cunning of an emperor.

319
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:11,440
Whether Cousin Yan becomes Crown Prince or not,

320
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:13,060
I still want to marry him

321
00:14:13,090 --> 00:14:14,180
and stay by his side.

322
00:14:14,180 --> 00:14:16,780
Such pretty words of deep affection

323
00:14:16,810 --> 00:14:19,050
are fine for comforting Yan.

324
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,380
But a fool who waits for others to feed her

325
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:25,230
is not worthy of being a daughter of the Bai family.

326
00:14:25,820 --> 00:14:27,170
I know I was wrong.

327
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:30,170
As long as Yan has supporters in the court

328
00:14:30,190 --> 00:14:31,590
and troops under his command,

329
00:14:31,590 --> 00:14:33,450
even if he's not the Crown Prince,

330
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,250
I can also help him ascend to the throne.

331
00:14:37,270 --> 00:14:39,020
You want to

332
00:14:39,410 --> 00:14:42,470
make Yun's Army become Cousin Yan's troops?

333
00:14:44,150 --> 00:14:48,770
This is the Love-Slave Elixir, a secret potion passed down in the Bai family.

334
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:50,100
From now on, the palace

335
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,720
will probably not be peaceful anymore.
