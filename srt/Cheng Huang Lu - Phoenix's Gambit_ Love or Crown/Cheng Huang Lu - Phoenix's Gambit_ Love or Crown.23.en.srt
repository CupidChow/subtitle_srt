[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:46,380
[Episode 23]

3
00:01:08,550 --> 00:01:09,490
No.

4
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:10,600
This can't be me.

5
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:12,620
I can't be Bai Xiyue.

6
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:15,390
You think the life you were reborn into

7
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:17,420
was the only one life you would have?

8
00:01:17,870 --> 00:01:20,170
There is a thin line between good and bad.

9
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,950
Every different choice

10
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:25,590
leads to a different path of life.

11
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,630
They are all you,

12
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:29,980
yet none of them are you.

13
00:01:30,010 --> 00:01:31,289
Who are you exactly?

14
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:34,340
You're by no means that self-pitying Bai Xiyao.

15
00:01:44,759 --> 00:01:46,820
Immortal Master, I beg for your help!

16
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,050
Thank you, Immortal Master.

17
00:01:55,050 --> 00:01:56,370
Please send me home.

18
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,380
That won't be necessary.

19
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,630
The rest

20
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:00,710
will be taken care of by Bai Xiyao.

21
00:02:00,740 --> 00:02:01,900
Immortal Master,

22
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,780
I'm going to marry Yun Yichen.

23
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:06,380
Didn't you ask me to forsake romance?

24
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,310
I'm about to finish the task.

25
00:02:08,410 --> 00:02:09,530
Please send me home.

26
00:02:09,530 --> 00:02:11,140
You've done a good enough job

27
00:02:11,170 --> 00:02:13,170
by putting out the Karmic Fire.

28
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,750
But the last one problem

29
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:17,660
must be solved by Bai Xiyao herself.

30
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,150
What is her plan?

31
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,280
She...

32
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:24,130
She's going to kill Yun Yichen?

33
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,430
Only in this way

34
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:27,420
can she get rid of her sins

35
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,360
and finally

36
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,420
resume her original form.

37
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:33,320
But isn't she the good version of me?

38
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,370
Won't their divine consciousness

39
00:02:34,370 --> 00:02:36,370
all get back into my original form?

40
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,680
You think

41
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:39,480
what you've seen is untrue.

42
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,360
But you're wrong.

43
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:41,780
Bai Hong takes

44
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:45,030
various forms in the different Rivers of Time.

45
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:47,470
Her existence consists of many dimensions.

46
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,340
All the forms of Bai Hong

47
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,800
originate from her true self.

48
00:02:56,910 --> 00:02:58,350
Immortal Master,

49
00:02:58,370 --> 00:02:58,930
you...

50
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:00,690
Bai Hong,

51
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,740
go back to where you belong.

52
00:03:15,910 --> 00:03:17,910
Our souls are back to our own bodies?

53
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,420
That's right.

54
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:23,140
We each have our

55
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:24,620
own missions.

56
00:03:25,780 --> 00:03:27,050
It shouldn't be like this.

57
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:29,180
I should be the one to marry Yun Yichen.

58
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:32,000
Before your soul's return,

59
00:03:33,170 --> 00:03:36,620
why do you think Lianxin was replaced by Bai Xiyue?

60
00:03:36,810 --> 00:03:38,270
Why did Bai Xiyue

61
00:03:38,300 --> 00:03:40,960
insist on being with her sister for her wedding?

62
00:03:42,820 --> 00:03:45,150
Xiyue must have set up a fatal trap.

63
00:03:46,150 --> 00:03:47,870
She wants to witness Yun Yichen's death.

64
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:49,850
She plans to kill Yun Yichen.

65
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,320
She'll have you lose everything on the happiest day of your life.

66
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:57,390
She is utterly evil.

67
00:03:59,110 --> 00:04:00,110
[Older sister]

68
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:02,160
Bai Xiyao and I are sisters.

69
00:04:02,440 --> 00:04:03,950
But Bai Xiyue is also

70
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,850
my sister, isn't she?

71
00:04:07,240 --> 00:04:07,860
No.

72
00:04:07,890 --> 00:04:08,950
I will prove

73
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:10,280
that she isn't evil.

74
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:17,079
Bow to heaven and earth.

75
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,550
Consort Xian's status stops her from being present.

76
00:04:22,550 --> 00:04:25,740
But even Dad doesn't want to attend Bai Xiyao's wedding?

77
00:04:27,940 --> 00:04:30,000
If I were the one getting married now,

78
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:32,950
how would I feel?

79
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:37,350
Bow to each other.

80
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,510
Great.

81
00:04:42,530 --> 00:04:43,690
Yun Yichen got my hints,

82
00:04:43,690 --> 00:04:46,020
and has taken some precautions this time.

83
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,130
He has eliminated the assassins in advance.

84
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:53,940
Ceremony completed!

85
00:04:56,930 --> 00:04:57,350
[Love]

86
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:06,040
As it turns out, the Karmic Fire isn't just from the previous life,

87
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,570
but the three former lives!

88
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:17,510
Watch out!

89
00:05:17,530 --> 00:05:18,590
My Lord!

90
00:05:18,610 --> 00:05:19,870
Protect His Lordship!

91
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,090
No!

92
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:23,800
Protect Her Highness!

93
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:28,000
Why?

94
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:29,750
It has never been my intent to marry you.

95
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:31,760
I just want you to die.

96
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:36,720
Yun Yichen!

97
00:05:37,690 --> 00:05:38,810
Let go of me!

98
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:40,460
Yun Yichen!

99
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:44,250
Get the imperial physicians here now!

100
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:45,980
My Lord!

101
00:05:51,340 --> 00:05:53,520
You owe me this!

102
00:05:58,670 --> 00:06:00,540
Yun Yichen!

103
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:03,550
Yun Yichen!

104
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:40,250
Your Majesty,

105
00:06:40,270 --> 00:06:42,140
what's going on?

106
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:43,230
Your Majesty.

107
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:44,480
Help!

108
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:45,670
Your Majesty.

109
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:46,590
Your Majesty!

110
00:06:47,570 --> 00:06:49,100
Don't just stand there!

111
00:06:49,210 --> 00:06:51,070
Summon the imperial physicians!

112
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:51,920
Your Majesty!

113
00:06:51,920 --> 00:06:52,659
Your Majesty!

114
00:06:52,659 --> 00:06:54,260
His Majesty has passed away!

115
00:06:55,730 --> 00:06:56,680
Your Majesty.

116
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:58,409
Your Majesty!

117
00:06:59,060 --> 00:07:00,530
Your Majesty!

118
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:02,920
The Emperor passed away

119
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,550
before appointing a Crown Prince.

120
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:07,120
The country is in desperate need of a ruler.

121
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:12,030
We humbly request the Eldest Prince to ascend the throne.

122
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:16,760
Prince Si, please take the throne.

123
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,170
Prince Si, please take the throne.

124
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,170
Pei Si!

125
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,320
You killed your father for the throne.

126
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:22,480
What an outrage!

127
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:24,330
You'd better surrender now!

128
00:07:25,870 --> 00:07:28,250
You are the rebel!

129
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:30,660
Guards, take him down!

130
00:07:32,070 --> 00:07:33,980
Don't you touch him!

131
00:07:34,010 --> 00:07:36,580
We're here to eliminate rebels and protect the imperial court

132
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:38,190
by Prince Yi's command!

133
00:07:39,010 --> 00:07:40,870
This is the late Emperor's will.

134
00:07:42,090 --> 00:07:44,320
Consort Hui will be the Empress.

135
00:07:44,350 --> 00:07:45,780
The prince she's pregnant with

136
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:47,180
will be the Crown Prince.

137
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:49,180
Nonsense!

138
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,620
Father already appointed my mother as the Empress,

139
00:07:52,620 --> 00:07:54,050
and me the Crown Prince.

140
00:07:54,090 --> 00:07:56,390
I am the rightful heir to the throne!

141
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:59,370
Noble Consort Li used poison in the palace,

142
00:07:59,390 --> 00:08:00,850
and caused the late Emperor's death.

143
00:08:00,850 --> 00:08:02,910
She has been taken down by Yun's Army,

144
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,560
and is now in prison.

145
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,020
You...

146
00:08:08,850 --> 00:08:10,840
You are staging a revolt!

147
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,100
Don't you think the imperial troops will do something?

148
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,010
I'll behead all of you!

149
00:08:15,030 --> 00:08:15,820
Your uncle,

150
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,060
namely the commander of the imperial troops, has been executed.

151
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,100
Stop fighting us. It's futile.

152
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:32,690
Pei Yan...

153
00:08:32,820 --> 00:08:34,549
What a good plan of yours.

154
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:36,520
How dare you collude with Yun's Army!

155
00:08:36,520 --> 00:08:37,740
Aren't you afraid

156
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,510
of being tricked by them

157
00:08:39,539 --> 00:08:42,480
and losing the whole empire to them?

158
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:47,040
Winner takes all.

159
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:49,690
Don't you find it ridiculous to talk about

160
00:08:50,180 --> 00:08:51,910
right and wrong with me now?

161
00:08:52,180 --> 00:08:53,240
Guards,

162
00:08:53,270 --> 00:08:54,360
put him behind bars.

163
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:56,360
I'll decide a sentence for him soon.

164
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:59,550
I didn't kill Father!

165
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:00,960
I didn't do it!

166
00:09:01,050 --> 00:09:02,410
Pei Yan did!

167
00:09:02,780 --> 00:09:04,240
I'm innocent!

168
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,140
I'm innocent!

169
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,110
I'm innocent!

170
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:25,740
Long live Your Majesty!

171
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,730
I meant to

172
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:29,300
cause harm to Noble Consort Li with that jade piece.

173
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,330
But unexpectedly, the Emperor died instead.

174
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:32,540
In the end,

175
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,250
I became the Empress again.

176
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,250
Me in my previous life...

177
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,310
Bai Xiyue in this life...

178
00:09:39,050 --> 00:09:41,710
Now I know how it feels to be the supreme Empress.

179
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:43,970
I'm inept at handling state affairs.

180
00:09:43,970 --> 00:09:46,970
I'll focus on giving birth to the future Crown Prince.

181
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:50,020
Therefore, I appoint the Third Prince, Pei Yan,

182
00:09:50,020 --> 00:09:51,750
as Prince Regent.

183
00:09:55,060 --> 00:09:57,230
Pei Si and his maternal relatives

184
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,420
formed cliques to pursue selfish interest.

185
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:01,280
They are a hazard for the country.

186
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,360
For committing such heinous crimes,

187
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:05,940
they shall all be severely punished.

188
00:10:16,710 --> 00:10:17,710
My Lord,

189
00:10:17,730 --> 00:10:19,190
please take the medicine.

190
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:38,310
See, when I was on the battlefield,

191
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,630
no matter how severe my injuries were,

192
00:10:40,630 --> 00:10:42,600
all I needed was some bandage.

193
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,620
Then, I'd go back to combat enemies.

194
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,340
However, in the Imperial Capital,

195
00:10:47,340 --> 00:10:48,870
I have to pretend to be sick every day,

196
00:10:48,870 --> 00:10:50,730
so my rivals would think I'm weak.

197
00:10:53,050 --> 00:10:54,400
I'm getting

198
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:56,170
more and more fragile.

199
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,330
Even a minor wound like this

200
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,030
would make me feel like I'm dying.

201
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:03,200
My Lord,

202
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:04,780
you will be fine.

203
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:07,020
There was no poison on the knife,

204
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,550
and you dodged it promptly.

205
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:09,850
You're spitting blood

206
00:11:09,850 --> 00:11:12,340
only because the blade pierced an old wound.

207
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,060
How is she?

208
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:19,390
She was confined at home,

209
00:11:19,730 --> 00:11:21,510
but Prince Regent issued an edict

210
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,770
and took her away.

211
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,200
The Bai family was punished for aiding the Eldest Prince.

212
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,200
Their entire clan were implicated.

213
00:11:27,260 --> 00:11:30,390
The Empress Dowager fell seriously ill because of that.

214
00:11:31,990 --> 00:11:33,350
Colluding in treason

215
00:11:34,140 --> 00:11:36,770
is grounds for capital punishment. Even the whole clan would be executed.

216
00:11:36,770 --> 00:11:37,570
What?

217
00:11:38,390 --> 00:11:40,390
Pei Yan planned to kill the Duchess?

218
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:42,980
Didn't he covet her?

219
00:11:43,130 --> 00:11:45,390
Maybe killing Bai Xiyao wasn't his goal.

220
00:11:46,830 --> 00:11:49,490
He just wanted to see what attitude I would take.

221
00:11:49,650 --> 00:11:51,600
[Harmony]

222
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,550
As long as Prince Yi acknowledges the marriage,

223
00:11:54,570 --> 00:11:55,480
then Bai Xiyao

224
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:57,070
will be respected as his wife,

225
00:11:57,070 --> 00:11:59,160
and she won't be punished with the Bai family.

226
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:00,500
What's Pei Yan's opinion?

227
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,240
This is what Prince Regent wants.

228
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:03,990
The other aides of the Eldest Prince

229
00:12:03,990 --> 00:12:06,730
have all been sentenced to death, including their families.

230
00:12:06,730 --> 00:12:08,270
Aren't they in love?

231
00:12:08,430 --> 00:12:10,960
Why is she longing for Yun Yichen's leniency?

232
00:12:12,830 --> 00:12:15,260
Pei Yan has really changed.

233
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,400
Xiyue,

234
00:12:16,430 --> 00:12:17,620
help me!

235
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:20,270
I don't want to be exiled to the northern deserts!

236
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:22,160
Stop begging this ungrateful woman!

237
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:24,060
You plotted against your own father.

238
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:25,420
What kind of daughter would do that?

239
00:12:25,420 --> 00:12:26,310
You animal!

240
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:28,100
Master, it was not like that.

241
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:29,450
Xiyue did it in the family's best interest.

242
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,820
She's the Empress now.

243
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:31,690
She will save our lives.

244
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:32,490
Enough!

245
00:12:33,490 --> 00:12:34,810
She's just a woman.

246
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:37,560
What can she do as the Empress, or even the Empress Dowager?

247
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,950
She has no power at all.

248
00:12:38,980 --> 00:12:41,070
She can't bring anything to our descendants!

249
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,240
The Bai family

250
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:45,010
wouldn't have been destroyed

251
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,690
if it hadn't been in the charge of women!

252
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:48,490
What's wrong with being a woman?

253
00:12:49,340 --> 00:12:51,800
The former wealth and glory of the Bai family

254
00:12:52,030 --> 00:12:54,380
were brought by women, weren't they?

255
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,250
As men, you were given

256
00:12:56,420 --> 00:12:58,500
birth by women, weren't you?

257
00:12:58,530 --> 00:12:59,730
Since ancient times,

258
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,060
when men make mistakes,

259
00:13:01,610 --> 00:13:02,660
be they commoners

260
00:13:02,660 --> 00:13:03,730
or emperors,

261
00:13:04,570 --> 00:13:06,100
they would all shift the blame to women,

262
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:07,030
accusing women of being

263
00:13:07,030 --> 00:13:08,230
hazards and destroyers.

264
00:13:08,230 --> 00:13:10,440
Men make up those excuses to cover for their incompetence!

265
00:13:10,440 --> 00:13:11,120
You...

266
00:13:14,940 --> 00:13:17,470
Dad, take a good look.

267
00:13:18,140 --> 00:13:20,600
Your daughter became the Empress

268
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,150
through her own efforts.

269
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,700
Your concubine still sticks around

270
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,650
even when you're about to be exiled.

271
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,650
It is me, your first daughter,

272
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:29,410
who will take care of you in old age.

273
00:13:29,410 --> 00:13:31,150
By contrast, have you ever

274
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,370
cared about me?

275
00:13:34,950 --> 00:13:37,060
Is my mother's premature death

276
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:38,820
the reason that you play favor to your concubine

277
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:40,220
and her daughter?

278
00:13:40,250 --> 00:13:42,400
Was my mother not a good enough wife?

279
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:44,970
Am I not a good enough daughter?

280
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:47,160
Master...

281
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:48,970
I'm wrong.

282
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,670
It's all my fault.

283
00:13:52,370 --> 00:13:53,700
I should've treated you

284
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:56,330
and your mother better.

285
00:14:18,280 --> 00:14:19,620
My father's love for me

286
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:24,620
has actually helped me restore some celestial power.

287
00:14:25,670 --> 00:14:26,780
It means...

288
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:27,830
I can...

289
00:14:33,300 --> 00:14:34,430
Guards,

290
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:37,030
take these people away.

291
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,590
Her Majesty has an announcement to make.
