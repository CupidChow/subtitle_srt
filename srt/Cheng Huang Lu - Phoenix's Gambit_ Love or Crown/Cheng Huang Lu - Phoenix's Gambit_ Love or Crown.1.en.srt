00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:06,170
Let go of me!

192
00:08:06,630 --> 00:08:06,790
♫Love falls♫

193
00:08:06,790 --> 00:08:08,030
I'm not mad!

194
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:08,680
I am the non-imperial prince of Fengqi State!

195
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:10,080
♫Unreturned♫

196
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:13,200
♫In bridal red and white garb♫

197
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:13,650
♫Hair tied in lifelong bond♫

198
00:08:13,650 --> 00:08:14,530
Xiyue.

199
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:17,610
♫Who was it?♫

200
00:08:17,610 --> 00:08:18,070
You helped me eliminate vassals and consolidate power.

201
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:20,080
♫Ask not whether our next life♫

202
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:20,870
I'll grant you the title of empress.

203
00:08:20,870 --> 00:08:22,900
♫Could be like♫

204
00:08:23,610 --> 00:08:23,960
♫Our first meeting♫

205
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:25,470
Thank you, Your Majesty.

206
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:34,909
The gods bear witness.

207
00:08:34,929 --> 00:08:37,100
The sun and moon in harmony.

208
00:08:37,130 --> 00:08:39,200
Miss Bai is virtuous.

209
00:08:39,220 --> 00:08:41,270
Her grace shines across the land.

210
00:08:41,289 --> 00:08:43,200
Long known for her good name.

211
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,350
I, Bai Xiyue,

212
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:45,520
from this day forth,

213
00:08:45,540 --> 00:08:47,420
am the mistress of this imperial harem,

214
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,900
the most powerful woman

215
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:50,330
under heaven.

216
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:52,020
Worthy of the grand ceremony,

217
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,660
in accordance with the sacred decree,

218
00:08:54,680 --> 00:08:56,600
with the seal bestowed,

219
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:00,000
you are hereby made Empress.

220
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:00,580
This...

221
00:09:00,650 --> 00:09:02,060
Why has snow suddenly begun to fall?

222
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:04,150
Interrupting the coronation ceremony.

223
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,450
Such an omen

224
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,780
is most inauspicious.

225
00:09:06,930 --> 00:09:08,010
An ill omen.

226
00:09:08,860 --> 00:09:10,150
Ill omen?

227
00:09:10,170 --> 00:09:11,150
Watch your words.

228
00:09:12,510 --> 00:09:14,470
Anyone who stands in my way,

229
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:16,890
I will crush them.

230
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,530
My Lady.

231
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,460
My Lady.

232
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,220
Father.

233
00:09:30,630 --> 00:09:32,330
I was indeed saved,

234
00:09:32,330 --> 00:09:33,500
but absolutely no lover was involved.

235
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:35,400
And I was pushed into...

236
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,300
Still arguing?

237
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:39,200
Have you forgotten my teachings?

238
00:09:40,140 --> 00:09:41,000
Xiyao.

239
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:41,730
After being soaked,

240
00:09:41,730 --> 00:09:44,030
you even had physical contact with a strange man.

241
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:45,660
You've not yet married;

242
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:46,620
is this not

243
00:09:46,650 --> 00:09:47,700
a tarnished reputation?

244
00:09:47,730 --> 00:09:48,620
If word spreads

245
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:50,880
of something harmful to the Bai family's name,

246
00:09:51,330 --> 00:09:52,180
Then I shall no longer

247
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:53,700
consider you my daughter.

248
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,300
Father,

249
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,830
please don't!

250
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,200
Xiyao is the legitimate daughter.

251
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:00,320
She is to marry the crown prince in the future.

252
00:10:00,710 --> 00:10:02,540
Please be lenient.

253
00:10:02,780 --> 00:10:04,210
Whoever marries the crown prince

254
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:05,500
shall be the legitimate daughter.

255
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:06,410
The Bai family

256
00:10:06,440 --> 00:10:08,000
can have only one daughter.

257
00:10:08,330 --> 00:10:09,840
That is the future empress.

258
00:10:14,670 --> 00:10:17,060
The ceremonial official has received the imperial edict.

259
00:10:17,080 --> 00:10:19,390
Proceed with the rites accordingly.

260
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:21,810
The whole state

261
00:10:21,830 --> 00:10:24,550
shall celebrate this grand occasion.

262
00:10:28,270 --> 00:10:29,360
Present it.

263
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:32,850
What is happening?

264
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,420
My body…

265
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:43,970
I deserve death.

266
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,370
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

267
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:48,080
Just a little more,

268
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:49,350
and I would become / and I'll become

269
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,450
Empress.

270
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:51,800
Pick it up.

271
00:10:52,900 --> 00:10:54,680
I pardon you.

272
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:00,420
Mi…

273
00:11:01,780 --> 00:11:03,570
Mine…

274
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:06,090
Why?

275
00:11:06,590 --> 00:11:08,500
Just one more step,

276
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:13,210
and I would have had everything.

277
00:11:14,230 --> 00:11:16,200
Why…

278
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:50,480
Where is this?

279
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,910
Why am I dead?

280
00:11:57,940 --> 00:11:58,860
Bai Hong!

281
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:02,370
Who dares to be so impudent?

282
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:03,360
Bai Hong.

283
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,950
Return at once!

284
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:10,620
You were originally my disciple Bai Hong,

285
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:12,400
If you transcend the karmic entanglements of the mortal world,

286
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:13,820
you can become an immortal,

287
00:12:13,850 --> 00:12:16,760
and be entered into the celestial registry of Yuanhuang Palace.

288
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:19,460
Immortal Master.

289
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:21,180
Why did I fail the tribulation?

290
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:23,330
Without loss, there is no gain.

291
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:25,220
If you do not lose,

292
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:27,430
how will you understand the preciousness of love?

293
00:12:27,530 --> 00:12:29,280
Without cherishing it,

294
00:12:29,300 --> 00:12:31,140
how can you let it go?

295
00:12:31,840 --> 00:12:33,900
I do not understand what went wrong.

296
00:12:33,930 --> 00:12:35,420
I had already

297
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:36,630
played love in the palm of my hand,

298
00:12:36,650 --> 00:12:38,970
became the most powerful woman in the world.

299
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,060
Still lost in delusion…

300
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:43,880
Seems you must once again enter the cycle of reincarnation,

301
00:12:43,900 --> 00:12:46,110
to experience it anew.

302
00:12:57,070 --> 00:12:58,570
Someone help! The young lady fell in the water!

303
00:12:58,590 --> 00:12:59,730
Help!

304
00:13:04,230 --> 00:13:07,020
Bai Xiyue is still Bai Xiyue.

305
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:10,740
But you are no longer yourself.

306
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,440
My Lady!

307
00:13:20,570 --> 00:13:21,930
My Lady, are you alright?

308
00:13:22,530 --> 00:13:24,590
Shall I come in and serve you?

309
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:26,250
Come in and help me dress.

310
00:13:27,810 --> 00:13:29,570
My Lady, are you feeling better?

311
00:13:33,890 --> 00:13:34,700
My...

312
00:13:35,340 --> 00:13:36,510
My face…

313
00:13:36,530 --> 00:13:37,350
Why…

314
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:39,390
Has it become Bai Xiyao's?

315
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:40,440
My Lady.

316
00:13:40,460 --> 00:13:41,800
My Lady, what's wrong?

317
00:13:44,010 --> 00:13:45,920
This is Bai Xiyao's room.

318
00:13:48,460 --> 00:13:50,150
You are her personal maid, Lianxin.

319
00:13:50,260 --> 00:13:50,610
My Lady.

320
00:13:50,610 --> 00:13:51,500
[Personal maid of Bai Xiyao - Lianxin]

321
00:13:51,500 --> 00:13:53,010
Please don't scare me…

322
00:13:53,210 --> 00:13:54,130
I…

323
00:13:54,690 --> 00:13:57,090
I don't understand what you're saying.

324
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:01,660
Why was I not reincarnated as Bai Xiyue?

325
00:14:02,150 --> 00:14:04,010
Even my soul has become Bai Xiyao.

326
00:14:05,150 --> 00:14:06,010
Immortal Master…

327
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,830
Did Immortal Master make a mistake?

328
00:14:08,230 --> 00:14:10,190
I still have all the memories of my past life.

329
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,710
Who exactly am I now?

330
00:14:12,120 --> 00:14:13,410
It's taken care of?

331
00:14:13,530 --> 00:14:14,530
My Lord.

332
00:14:15,130 --> 00:14:16,990
The person has already committed suicide by poison.

333
00:14:19,490 --> 00:14:20,950
They poisoned the water source.

334
00:14:21,780 --> 00:14:23,010
Seems His Majesty

335
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:25,540
doesn't want me to return to the capital in peace.

336
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,030
My Lord.

337
00:14:27,050 --> 00:14:28,170
You've returned to the capital

338
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:28,300
with only one pair of cavalry,

339
00:14:28,300 --> 00:14:30,050
[Deputy general of Yun Yichen - Tao Yu]

340
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:31,820
Aren't you walking straight into danger?

341
00:14:33,520 --> 00:14:35,840
That's exactly what I want.  To be a powerless,

342
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,930
easily manipulated useless man,

343
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:40,560
best if I can even seek a marriage alliance.

344
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,320
What?

345
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,760
You want to get married?

346
00:14:44,930 --> 00:14:46,400
I just think women

347
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,410
only slow down your sword.

348
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,760
Getting married in the capital

349
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:55,240
will lull the Emperor

350
00:14:55,270 --> 00:14:57,260
into letting down his guard.

351
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:59,910
I must return to my old home in Luzhou,

352
00:14:59,930 --> 00:15:02,420
Only there can I regroup the Yun's Army.

353
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:03,980
With military power,

354
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:05,760
I can avenge my parents.

355
00:15:06,400 --> 00:15:07,560
My Lord.

356
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:09,360
Your injuries haven't healed yet.

357
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:11,070
Shall we slow down and

358
00:15:11,100 --> 00:15:11,960
delay our return to the capital by two days?

359
00:15:11,990 --> 00:15:12,850
No need.

360
00:15:13,730 --> 00:15:16,060
The troops and horses will proceed as planned.

361
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,510
You and I will enter the city in advance.

362
00:15:19,310 --> 00:15:21,330
I want to visit an old place.

363
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:24,050
I'll prepare the decoy in the carriage immediately.

364
00:15:33,590 --> 00:15:35,390
If only I were marrying you...

365
00:15:36,280 --> 00:15:37,510
Little Bai.
