00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:46,390
[Episode 12]

3
00:00:50,010 --> 00:00:51,980
Please give it to me, will you?

4
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:54,120
I've tried so hard.

5
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:56,330
I've suffered much, Immortal Master.

6
00:00:56,630 --> 00:00:57,730
Immortal Master?

7
00:01:00,130 --> 00:01:01,530
She doesn't want to marry you,

8
00:01:01,900 --> 00:01:03,090
but I do.

9
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,150
I'm sorry,

10
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:06,310
Yun Yichen.

11
00:01:31,940 --> 00:01:33,470
How long was I out for?

12
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:34,500
Just like last time.

13
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:36,789
About an hour.

14
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:41,160
When will I have this under control?

15
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,380
Miss Bai, you really need to treat

16
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:44,020
this condition of yours properly.

17
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:45,000
Otherwise...

18
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,280
you could easily harm others.

19
00:01:50,210 --> 00:01:52,390
Your Lordship, since you're afraid of getting accidentally hurt,

20
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:54,810
you can go back yourself now.

21
00:01:55,710 --> 00:01:57,780
Thank you for helping me detoxify.

22
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:00,490
You're welcome.

23
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:01,870
There won't be a next time.

24
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,680
How do you know how to detoxify it?

25
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:07,620
Do you have something to do with this drug?

26
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,240
Why are you being so fierce?

27
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,570
This drug is called Love-Slave Elixir.

28
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:15,630
It's a secret drug exclusive to our family.

29
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,480
The Love-Slave Elixir appeared

30
00:02:18,500 --> 00:02:19,960
both in the Imperial Kitchen and with Bai Xiyue.

31
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,240
There must be a connection.

32
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:23,980
Why did you poison me?

33
00:02:25,060 --> 00:02:26,510
Let go of me!

34
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:28,570
I didn't poison you.

35
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:30,100
It was my sister, Bai Xiyue.

36
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:31,290
You were simply unfortunate enough

37
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:32,740
to drink from the Eldest Prince's cup.

38
00:02:33,730 --> 00:02:34,860
So this is

39
00:02:35,110 --> 00:02:36,260
some kind of aphrodisiac?

40
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:38,720
Your sister Xiyue tried to seduce the Eldest Prince?

41
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:39,940
What do you mean, "seduce"?

42
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:41,130
That sounds so vulgar.

43
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:41,710
This...

44
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:43,590
this is called control.

45
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:46,220
The Love-Slave Elixir can control a person's mind,

46
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,890
turning them into a lovesick puppet.

47
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:52,079
I had no idea that your family was so terrifying.

48
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:53,710
So, you two sisters

49
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:55,220
are determined to secure

50
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,530
the title of Crown Princess?

51
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,579
Of course.

52
00:02:59,600 --> 00:03:01,400
Didn't you witness it yourself last time, Your Lordship?

53
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,860
Then I'll take my leave.

54
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:07,480
I hope our paths will never cross again.

55
00:03:09,490 --> 00:03:10,710
That's exactly what I want too.

56
00:03:12,030 --> 00:03:13,380
I went to pay respects,

57
00:03:13,410 --> 00:03:15,960
yet she meddled in my decision to appoint the Crown Prince.

58
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:17,050
Your Majesty, please calm down.

59
00:03:17,079 --> 00:03:19,280
Today is Her Highness's birthday, after all.

60
00:03:20,770 --> 00:03:22,660
So what if Yan is the Empress's son?

61
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,500
He's only close to the Empress Dowager!

62
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,510
Only Noble Consort Li and Si

63
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,480
have given me the rare warmth of family in this palace.

64
00:03:30,520 --> 00:03:31,670
Then tonight, Your Majesty,

65
00:03:31,690 --> 00:03:33,760
will you still be resting at Noble Consort Li's palace?

66
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,850
No.

67
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:38,710
I'm tired.

68
00:03:38,850 --> 00:03:40,410
Just get some fresh air, and then I'll head back.

69
00:03:44,160 --> 00:03:45,400
It's curfew already.

70
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:46,960
Who is so ignorant of court etiquette?

71
00:03:47,590 --> 00:03:49,650
It's a maid who doesn't know the rules.

72
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:54,170
How could a palace maid be wearing the dress of a noble family's daughter?

73
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:57,390
Come with me to take a look.

74
00:03:57,420 --> 00:03:58,170
Yes, Your Majesty.

75
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,500
How dare you! Who are you?

76
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:03,950
Who allowed you to mess around here?

77
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:05,190
Prince Si, please forgive me.

78
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,750
I am Bai Xiyue, daughter of the Minister of Rites.

79
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,980
I did not mean to disturb Your Highness.

80
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,100
What nonsense are you talking about?

81
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:12,720
Seeing His Majesty, the Phoenix Emperor,

82
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:14,630
hurry and kneel down to pay your respects.

83
00:04:17,230 --> 00:04:18,649
Raise your head.

84
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:24,200
Why did you call me "Prince Si"?

85
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:26,900
Your Majesty,

86
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,480
I panicked and spoke foolishly just now.

87
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:32,930
I only saw a handsome young man in royal robes,

88
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:35,550
so I thought it was Prince Si whom I had seen...

89
00:04:36,130 --> 00:04:37,730
at the birthday banquet earlier.

90
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:42,100
Among all the princes,

91
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:45,440
is Si the one who resembles me the most?

92
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:47,930
Your Majesty, indeed, it is.

93
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:52,280
You may rise.

94
00:04:57,530 --> 00:04:59,710
After attending the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet,

95
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:01,430
why did you not return home

96
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,250
instead of lingering in the palace?

97
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:08,080
I came to the palace in the same carriage as my elder sister,

98
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,340
but for some reason, she left first after the banquet ended.

99
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,880
As curfew approached,

100
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,140
no one came for me.

101
00:05:15,810 --> 00:05:17,500
Thankfully, Prince Yan

102
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:19,930
let me stay in the palace's side wing guest room.

103
00:05:20,670 --> 00:05:22,240
However, before bed,

104
00:05:22,270 --> 00:05:24,070
there were no maids to help me wash up before bed,

105
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:26,750
so I was just briefly doing it...

106
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:29,460
by the pool.

107
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,230
Xiyue,

108
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:33,530
you can rest here tonight.

109
00:05:33,590 --> 00:05:34,650
If you need anything,

110
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:36,210
just give them your orders directly.

111
00:05:36,909 --> 00:05:38,330
Thank you, Cousin Yan.

112
00:05:40,260 --> 00:05:41,060
Oh, right,

113
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:43,360
this is the back garden that His Majesty frequently visits.

114
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,820
You mustn't wander around carelessly,

115
00:05:44,950 --> 00:05:46,150
lest you disturb His Majesty.

116
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:49,900
I know.

117
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,010
Return to the mansion.

118
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:54,990
Goodbye, Cousin Yan.

119
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:03,740
Yan is so careless...

120
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:06,900
always not thinking things through.

121
00:06:07,750 --> 00:06:08,670
I...

122
00:06:09,740 --> 00:06:11,190
forgive you.

123
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:14,120
Thank you, Your Majesty.

124
00:06:14,140 --> 00:06:15,870
Send someone to attend to her,

125
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,650
lest others laugh at our royal family

126
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:19,930
for poor hospitality

127
00:06:19,950 --> 00:06:21,370
and lack of etiquette.

128
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,800
Yes, Your Majesty.

129
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:26,130
Come to think of it,

130
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:28,790
you are my niece by maternal ties.

131
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,180
You should come visit me, your uncle,

132
00:06:31,210 --> 00:06:33,110
at the palace more often in the future.

133
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:35,840
I dare not presume to such familiarity.

134
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:37,830
Your Majesty is the emperor,

135
00:06:37,860 --> 00:06:39,700
and relatives are still subjects.

136
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:43,090
I'm merely a subject blessed by Your Majesty's grace.

137
00:06:46,950 --> 00:06:49,150
You are humble and well-mannered.

138
00:06:50,670 --> 00:06:51,850
Interesting.

139
00:06:52,730 --> 00:06:54,220
The Minister of Rites...

140
00:06:54,650 --> 00:06:56,260
has a good daughter.

141
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:00,590
Thank you for Your Majesty's kindness.

142
00:07:08,390 --> 00:07:11,610
[Bai's Mansion]

143
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:13,070
Where on earth has Xiyue gone?

144
00:07:17,780 --> 00:07:18,760
Where were you last night?

145
00:07:18,790 --> 00:07:20,380
Why didn't you bring your sister back home?

146
00:07:20,580 --> 00:07:22,850
The Empress Dowager rewarded me with a house.

147
00:07:22,950 --> 00:07:24,790
As a matter of courtesy, I had to go and receive it.

148
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,340
What?

149
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:29,490
Didn't Xiyue return home on her own?

150
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:30,690
What?

151
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:32,890
You left your sister in the palace?

152
00:07:33,150 --> 00:07:34,420
Don't worry, Madam.

153
00:07:34,650 --> 00:07:35,980
How could you say I left her?

154
00:07:36,430 --> 00:07:38,400
I was giving Xiyue and Cousin Yan

155
00:07:38,420 --> 00:07:40,310
more opportunities to get to know each other.

156
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:43,720
Since she hasn't returned home yet,

157
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:45,550
she must have stayed overnight in the palace.

158
00:07:45,580 --> 00:07:46,430
Nonsense!

159
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,180
How can the palace be a place where people can stay at will?

160
00:07:48,310 --> 00:07:49,710
You're going to get your sister into trouble!

161
00:07:49,750 --> 00:07:51,780
How could sending her to the palace get Xiyue into trouble?

162
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,680
So, Father,

163
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:59,180
you don't want Xiyue to marry into the royal family?

164
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:01,380
But why do I feel like

165
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:03,180
Xiyue doesn't think that way?

166
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:03,900
You...

167
00:08:03,920 --> 00:08:07,290
Respectfully see the Bai family's second young lady home!

168
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:09,300
Dad, Mom.

169
00:08:09,930 --> 00:08:10,690
Xiyue.

170
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:11,800
I'm back.

171
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,960
Xiyue, are you alright?

172
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,950
Did anything happen last night?

173
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:17,470
Thanks to Xiyao this time,

174
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,220
she took me to the palace and met all those noble sirs in the palace.

175
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,320
You're too polite, Xiyue.

176
00:08:24,350 --> 00:08:26,890
Helping my little sister rise is what I should do.

177
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:29,180
Did you use it?

178
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:30,070
Do you still have it?

179
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:31,570
I didn't get the chance.

180
00:08:31,590 --> 00:08:33,630
You're entering the palace tomorrow.

181
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,820
I have something important to give you.

182
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:37,179
Mom,

183
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,400
what's so important that it can't be given to me during the day?

184
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:40,840
Why sneak around in the middle of the night?

185
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:42,030
No.

186
00:08:42,179 --> 00:08:44,500
This item is crucial for your future prospects.

187
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:46,540
We can't let anyone know about it,

188
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:48,340
especially Bai Xiyao.

189
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:51,700
Mom,

190
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:53,540
what is this?

191
00:08:53,560 --> 00:08:56,640
It can make the princes fall completely under your spell.

192
00:08:58,560 --> 00:08:59,690
It's an aphrodisiac?

193
00:08:59,710 --> 00:09:00,730
Your father went through great effort

194
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:02,850
to beg this from the Empress Dowager,

195
00:09:02,890 --> 00:09:04,090
the Bai family's secret drug,

196
00:09:04,230 --> 00:09:06,050
the Love-Slave Elixir.

197
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:08,260
So, this is the Love-Slave Elixir.

198
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:11,500
How should I use it?

199
00:09:11,530 --> 00:09:12,600
Your father has asked you

200
00:09:12,650 --> 00:09:15,650
to find an opportunity tomorrow to add it to Pei Si's wine.

201
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:17,200
Then create a chance

202
00:09:17,230 --> 00:09:18,750
to be alone with him.

203
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:21,030
Pei Si...

204
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,550
the Eldest Prince?

205
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:25,060
Hasn't our family always followed the Empress Dowager

206
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,400
in supporting Pei Yan?

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:27,870
With your sister in the way,

208
00:09:27,900 --> 00:09:29,630
do you think you still have a chance?

209
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,200
Moreover,

210
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:33,670
the Eldest Prince has His Majesty's favor.

211
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:35,710
He's more likely to be named Crown Prince.

212
00:09:35,730 --> 00:09:38,870
Of course, we should support the rightful heir.

213
00:09:39,470 --> 00:09:42,700
So, Bai Xiyao is just Dad's cover to placate the Empress Dowager.

214
00:09:43,070 --> 00:09:45,170
Dad's true loyalty is...

215
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:47,040
to the Phoenix Emperor?

216
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,530
The Empress Dowager is old.

217
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:50,340
It's time for some things

218
00:09:50,360 --> 00:09:53,470
to be passed on to the younger generation.

219
00:10:00,830 --> 00:10:01,720
Alright, Mom,

220
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:02,680
let's not talk about this now.

221
00:10:02,700 --> 00:10:03,280
Alright.

222
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,990
You two can go back to your room if you have anything to discuss.

223
00:10:08,350 --> 00:10:09,390
Since there's nothing else,

224
00:10:09,950 --> 00:10:10,770
Xiyao,

225
00:10:10,840 --> 00:10:11,990
you can go back to your room too.

226
00:10:15,970 --> 00:10:17,720
Madam Mei must have given

227
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,310
the Love-Slave Elixir to Bai Xiyue.

228
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:21,370
That Xiang from the Imperial Kitchen

229
00:10:21,470 --> 00:10:23,330
must work for my father and Madam Mei.

230
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,600
Love-Slave Elixir...

231
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:28,730
My Lord.

232
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:30,030
We've caught the person.

233
00:10:31,010 --> 00:10:32,010
Who?

234
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:33,350
That Xiang.

235
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:34,820
My Lord,

236
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:37,410
you seem a bit out of it.

237
00:10:39,510 --> 00:10:40,500
How did you catch him?

238
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:42,510
When he was in the woods outside the city,

239
00:10:42,530 --> 00:10:44,100
almost being buried alive in a pit,

240
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,430
Master Yuan and his men saved him just in time.

241
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:47,780
Looks like they wanted to silence him.

242
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:48,940
Let's go

243
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,120
to the dungeon.

244
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,540
Tell me,

245
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:56,210
how did you get the Love-Slave Elixir?

246
00:10:57,490 --> 00:10:58,330
My Lord...

247
00:10:59,700 --> 00:11:01,490
They told me

248
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,680
that the Love-Slave Elixir comes in red pills,

249
00:11:06,020 --> 00:11:10,020
with the scent of night-blooming vine flowers and honeydew.

250
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:19,630
I was warned not to steal too much,

251
00:11:19,870 --> 00:11:21,480
lest I be discovered

252
00:11:21,510 --> 00:11:22,800
and alert the Empress Dowager.

253
00:11:28,970 --> 00:11:30,470
Did you leak any of the drug

254
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:32,810
or feed it to rats?

255
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,720
My Lord,

256
00:11:36,750 --> 00:11:38,380
I didn't leak it.

257
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:40,480
It was that something unexpected happened

258
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:41,830
with the thing to wrap the drug.

259
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:43,780
Oh no,

260
00:11:43,810 --> 00:11:45,260
how did they dissolve?

261
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:01,120
I had no idea

262
00:12:01,310 --> 00:12:04,090
those pills were so susceptible to moisture and would dissolve so easily.

263
00:12:04,570 --> 00:12:06,650
They can only be stored in porcelain bottles.

264
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:08,300
Then do you know

265
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:10,260
why they sent you to steal the drug?

266
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:11,530
According...

267
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,280
according to Bai Wenli,

268
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:16,230
the Empress Dowager won't give him the full formula.

269
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:18,650
So he had no choice but to find a way

270
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:20,780
to steal this half-finished version.

271
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:22,860
This drug is only half-complete?

272
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,790
To think my dad wrote saying you were reliable.

273
00:12:25,810 --> 00:12:27,260
And this is how you handle things?

274
00:12:27,570 --> 00:12:28,350
Master and Madam,

275
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:29,170
I...

276
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,700
I really didn't know

277
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:32,710
that the drug would dissolve like that.

278
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,920
Please forgive me, Master and Madam.

279
00:12:34,950 --> 00:12:36,480
Because they are only half-finished

280
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,790
and not yet formed into pills.

281
00:12:37,810 --> 00:12:40,150
The Love-Slave Elixir needs to be refined with the blood
of the intended master to be formed into pills.

282
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:42,030
Only then will it render the person who takes it

283
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,180
completely obedient.

284
00:12:43,450 --> 00:12:44,880
After the pills are formed, they are difficult to preserve.

285
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:46,640
They lose potency after about a month.

286
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:47,610
Dear,

287
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,620
the half-finished drug has been contaminated with sweat.

288
00:12:49,730 --> 00:12:51,630
Will this compromise its effectiveness?

289
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:52,450
No.

290
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,630
Though not yet formed into pills,

291
00:12:55,030 --> 00:12:56,110
this potion

292
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:58,130
can still alter people's minds.

293
00:12:58,920 --> 00:12:59,830
However,

294
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:01,700
it needs to be mixed with alcohol

295
00:13:01,730 --> 00:13:03,100
to avoid detection.

296
00:13:04,460 --> 00:13:05,590
Give half to Xiyue.

297
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:05,990
Okay.

298
00:13:06,010 --> 00:13:07,950
I'll use the other half to recreate the formula.

299
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:13,170
Only successive heads of the Bai family have inherited
the formula for the Love-Slave Elixir.

300
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,320
The Empress Dowager, our great-aunt, also relied on it

301
00:13:15,350 --> 00:13:16,630
to gain the former emperor's exclusive favor back then.

302
00:13:17,260 --> 00:13:19,350
Now, I finally have it.

303
00:13:21,130 --> 00:13:22,380
You've done well this time.

304
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:23,880
I will reward you generously.

305
00:13:23,980 --> 00:13:25,760
Don't show your face in public for a while.

306
00:13:25,780 --> 00:13:27,200
After this blows over,

307
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,660
you'll have your share of wealth and honor.

308
00:13:28,690 --> 00:13:30,120
Yes, Master.

309
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:33,500
Xiyue's future depends on this one move.

310
00:13:33,520 --> 00:13:35,440
So even without being refined with blood...

311
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:38,020
it could potentially cause anyone

312
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:40,260
of the opposite sex to become infatuated and confused.

313
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:46,810
My Lord,

314
00:13:46,980 --> 00:13:48,540
I've confessed everything!

315
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,480
Please spare my life, my Lord!

316
00:13:51,510 --> 00:13:53,060
No one said anything about killing you.

317
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,870
Why are you panicking?

318
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,400
Besides,

319
00:13:57,860 --> 00:13:59,350
my Lord saved your life.

320
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,870
Isn't it only right...

321
00:14:00,990 --> 00:14:02,640
for you to repay him?

322
00:14:02,820 --> 00:14:03,530
Yes.

323
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,090
My Lord,

324
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:06,570
I'll do

325
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,060
whatever you ask me to do!

326
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,280
Alright, Tao Yu.

327
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:10,260
Stop teasing him.

328
00:14:11,020 --> 00:14:12,520
He's already a dead man.

329
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,900
If he returns home and is discovered, he will certainly die.

330
00:14:16,170 --> 00:14:16,970
Let's do this.

331
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,050
If he's willing,

332
00:14:19,290 --> 00:14:20,380
arrange a job

333
00:14:20,410 --> 00:14:21,690
for him at the charity hall.

334
00:14:22,050 --> 00:14:23,050
If he's not willing...

335
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,550
give him some travel expenses

336
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,830
and send him south to live under a new identity.

337
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,410
Yes, my Lord.

338
00:14:30,140 --> 00:14:31,830
Thank you for your great kindness, my Lord!

339
00:14:31,870 --> 00:14:34,150
Thank you for your great kindness, my Lord!

340
00:14:49,590 --> 00:14:50,520
As expected...

341
00:14:51,350 --> 00:14:53,440
Yun Yichen does have some ability.

342
00:14:54,250 --> 00:14:56,420
I knew he could uncover something fishy.

343
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:09,930
I've exhausted all my celestial power.

344
00:15:09,930 --> 00:15:11,260
Now I'm nothing but useless.

345
00:15:22,890 --> 00:15:24,120
In my previous life,

346
00:15:24,650 --> 00:15:25,970
if it weren't for me,

347
00:15:26,750 --> 00:15:30,200
Yun Yichen wouldn't have become completely useless, would he?

348
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:32,590
Xiyue,

349
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:34,150
please give it to me now.

350
00:15:35,510 --> 00:15:37,100
Kneel down and beg me.

351
00:15:37,940 --> 00:15:38,680
Okay.

352
00:15:39,390 --> 00:15:40,270
Xiyue,

353
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,450
I'll do anything you say.

354
00:15:52,830 --> 00:15:54,740
The Love-Slave Elixir can induce feelings of love,

355
00:15:55,030 --> 00:15:56,780
making people become addicted and easily manipulated.

356
00:15:57,020 --> 00:15:59,420
Those who take it for a long time gradually become mentally confused,

357
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,590
irritable, quick-tempered,

358
00:16:00,610 --> 00:16:02,150
and may even experience hallucinations.

359
00:16:02,230 --> 00:16:04,000
Finally, they descend into madness and die.

360
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:12,460
Yichen,

361
00:16:13,290 --> 00:16:15,120
today is the Lantern Festival.

362
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,580
How I wish this wine we share

363
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:19,010
could be our wedding wine.
