[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,340
[Episode 22]

3
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:50,260
My Lady,

4
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:50,990
Lady Xiyue

5
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:52,590
came to visit the Master and Madam,

6
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,230
chatted with them for about two hours, and then left.

7
00:00:54,230 --> 00:00:55,360
What else did she do?

8
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:56,620
She left a gift box,

9
00:00:56,650 --> 00:00:58,980
but we servants don't know what's inside.

10
00:01:00,370 --> 00:01:01,200
I understand.

11
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,660
You may go and rest now.

12
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,030
I'd rather stay with you, My Lady.

13
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:06,760
Let me help you prepare for bed.

14
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:09,280
Many things will happen in the next few days.

15
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:10,220
I can't sleep.

16
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:11,200
You may go.

17
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:12,920
Yes, My Lady.

18
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,050
Didn't I say I don't need to be attended to?

19
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:34,670
Why are you so unsettled?

20
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,789
Why are you here?

21
00:01:43,350 --> 00:01:44,690
I've come to see you for treatment.

22
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:46,110
I'm not a doctor.

23
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,190
Besides,

24
00:01:47,210 --> 00:01:48,870
isn't there an imperial physician in your residence?

25
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,289
Why come to me?

26
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:55,710
It hurts right here.

27
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,240
What's wrong?

28
00:01:57,259 --> 00:01:59,190
Has your knife wound flared up again...

29
00:01:59,190 --> 00:02:00,470
I had a dream.

30
00:02:01,940 --> 00:02:03,870
In the dream, after we got married,

31
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:06,090
I treated you poorly.

32
00:02:07,290 --> 00:02:08,530
I hurt you at every turn

33
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:10,060
and refused to believe you.

34
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,560
In the end, you died filled with hatred.

35
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,060
But I got what I deserved.

36
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:21,800
I ended up dying of illness in prison.

37
00:02:23,170 --> 00:02:23,970
What...

38
00:02:23,990 --> 00:02:25,740
what else did you dream of?

39
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:28,550
I dreamed that you risked your life to save me,

40
00:02:28,550 --> 00:02:30,079
but I let you down.

41
00:02:30,350 --> 00:02:31,610
My heart ached.

42
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:33,240
I regretted it so much!

43
00:02:35,190 --> 00:02:37,340
Fortunately, in the end, Aunt avenged us.

44
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:39,280
My Yun!

45
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:44,600
My Yun!

46
00:02:53,320 --> 00:02:54,520
Maids, come here!

47
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:08,670
What?

48
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:12,820
I used to think it was Pei Yan, or maybe the Empress Dowager,

49
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:14,590
but I never expected that it would be Consort Xian

50
00:03:14,590 --> 00:03:17,190
who poisoned and killed me in my previous life.

51
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,630
You said it yourself: it was just a dream.

52
00:03:32,630 --> 00:03:33,810
No matter how real it felt

53
00:03:33,810 --> 00:03:34,740
or how painful it was,

54
00:03:34,740 --> 00:03:36,540
it was just a dream.

55
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,370
You're right.

56
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:46,020
Without loss, how can there be gain?

57
00:03:46,020 --> 00:03:47,320
Without losing,

58
00:03:47,350 --> 00:03:49,680
how can one know the preciousness of love?

59
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:52,079
I will cherish what I have now.

60
00:03:53,329 --> 00:03:54,329
Immortal Master,

61
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:56,300
why did I fail the tribulation?

62
00:03:56,300 --> 00:03:58,710
Without loss, how can there be gain?

63
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:02,680
Without losing, how can one know the preciousness of love?

64
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,760
What's wrong?

65
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,980
Are you scared or something?

66
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:10,020
N-Nothing.

67
00:04:10,950 --> 00:04:12,090
I just...

68
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,870
hate all these schemes

69
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,760
and plotting against each other.

70
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:20,930
Don't worry.

71
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:23,450
After we get married,

72
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:26,540
we'll live freely, like a pair of free-spirited birds.

73
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:28,510
We'll go to the frontier

74
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,910
or the southern islands.

75
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:33,260
We won't be caged birds in this capital.

76
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,600
[Half a month later]

77
00:04:53,420 --> 00:04:55,620
My Lady, you look absolutely stunning.

78
00:04:56,440 --> 00:04:58,880
You seem happier about my wedding than I am.

79
00:04:58,909 --> 00:05:00,190
Of course.

80
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:03,130
This will be our home from now on.

81
00:05:03,160 --> 00:05:05,190
His Lordship dotes on you so much,

82
00:05:05,270 --> 00:05:07,150
and I'll be able to see my brother often too.

83
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,610
We'll never have to return to that wretched Bai's Mansion again.

84
00:05:10,610 --> 00:05:11,540
Yeah.

85
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:15,310
I suppose I'll have nothing to do with the Bai family anymore.

86
00:05:15,310 --> 00:05:17,370
The auspicious time has arrived!

87
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:43,310
My Lady?

88
00:05:45,730 --> 00:05:46,580
I'm fine.

89
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,060
Let's go.

90
00:06:15,010 --> 00:06:17,010
You've done so much for me.

91
00:06:17,040 --> 00:06:18,370
What do you mean by this?

92
00:06:18,390 --> 00:06:20,010
I should thank you.

93
00:06:20,510 --> 00:06:23,430
Now, your role has finished.

94
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,670
No, this is my life.

95
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:27,790
How could you replace me?

96
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,170
Your life?

97
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:31,430
I am the real Bai Xiyao.

98
00:06:32,570 --> 00:06:34,720
You were just atoning for your sins...

99
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,310
making up for the mistakes you made.

100
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:41,240
I'm not your sister, Bai Xiyue!

101
00:06:41,480 --> 00:06:43,610
I am Bai Hong from the Yunhuang Palace.

102
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:45,510
You are just a split incarnation of my tribulation.

103
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:46,890
I am the true self.

104
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:49,750
Which "you" do you think you really are?

105
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:51,950
Bai Hong,

106
00:06:51,980 --> 00:06:53,260
Bai Xiyue,

107
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:54,690
or Bai Xiyao?

108
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:57,900
What makes you think you're the only one?

109
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,530
Do you think the previous life you experienced was the first one?

110
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:04,860
I'm tired of listening to your bewitching lies.

111
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:06,290
You can't trap me.

112
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:08,170
The Immortal Master will help me.

113
00:07:09,070 --> 00:07:10,080
Immortal Master?

114
00:07:10,110 --> 00:07:11,970
Immortal Master, please save me!

115
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:15,250
Since you don't believe me,

116
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:17,070
then let me show you.

117
00:07:22,050 --> 00:07:23,160
Catch her!

118
00:07:25,150 --> 00:07:26,470
Let go of me!

119
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:29,580
Let go of me! This is for my mother!

120
00:07:31,250 --> 00:07:32,990
This is for the refugees.

121
00:07:33,010 --> 00:07:34,110
You can't take it.

122
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,220
Xiyao, my mother is sick.

123
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:38,180
We haven't eaten for days.

124
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:39,490
We're almost starving to death.

125
00:07:39,490 --> 00:07:41,930
If your mother hadn't seduced my father like a vixen,

126
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,320
my mother wouldn't have died of grief.

127
00:07:43,320 --> 00:07:45,220
You filthy lowborns don't deserve to live!

128
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:46,040
Let's go.

129
00:07:46,060 --> 00:07:47,860
The refugees are still waiting.

130
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,730
I've been wrongly accused.

131
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:12,250
I didn't have an affair with any man.

132
00:08:12,250 --> 00:08:15,120
Still won't confess? Looks like you haven't been soaked enough.

133
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:15,980
Continue.

134
00:08:19,660 --> 00:08:20,620
Lady Xiyao!

135
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:21,830
Xiyue knows she was wrong!

136
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:22,900
I beg you, show mercy

137
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,030
and spare her!

138
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,080
Lady Xiyao!

139
00:08:25,110 --> 00:08:26,400
Mom, I've done nothing wrong.

140
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:27,860
Don't beg her.

141
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,850
Fine.

142
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,850
Then I shall personally teach you some manners.

143
00:08:31,850 --> 00:08:34,049
Let's see just how tough you really are.

144
00:08:34,130 --> 00:08:35,049
Lady Xiyao,

145
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,400
punish me instead.

146
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:38,220
Xiyue can't take it. She will die.

147
00:08:38,220 --> 00:08:39,159
Get off me!

148
00:08:46,460 --> 00:08:47,340
Mom!

149
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:51,370
Mom, are you all right?

150
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,540
I beg you all.

151
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:53,970
Please call a doctor!

152
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,230
I'm begging you!

153
00:08:55,250 --> 00:08:56,860
Please save my mom!

154
00:08:56,890 --> 00:08:57,540
Xiyao,

155
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:59,470
I'm begging you!

156
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,910
Xiyao!

157
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:09,800
Are you alright,

158
00:09:09,820 --> 00:09:11,040
young lady?

159
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,520
Xiyue, how could you be so careless

160
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:15,280
as to bump into Prince Yi?

161
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:17,970
Please forgive her, Your Highness.

162
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:18,940
It's fine.

163
00:09:19,080 --> 00:09:20,150
You may rise.

164
00:09:22,550 --> 00:09:24,220
This sister of mine

165
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:26,050
had improper relations with some man

166
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,240
and lost her virtue.

167
00:09:27,260 --> 00:09:30,090
Being just a concubine's daughter, there weren't many men
willing to marry her anyway.

168
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:33,210
And now, even fewer will come to propose.

169
00:09:36,520 --> 00:09:38,680
I plan to take her with me when I marry you.

170
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:40,160
At least under my wing,

171
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:41,690
no one will dare to bully her.

172
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,550
Your Highness, what do you think?

173
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:44,890
Xiyao, you have a kind heart.

174
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:45,810
Do as you wish.

175
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:56,660
Husband and wife, bow to each other!

176
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,880
Your Highness, watch out!

177
00:10:05,810 --> 00:10:07,160
Get out of the way!

178
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:16,730
There's an assassin!

179
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:17,830
Protect His Lordship!

180
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:18,850
Darling.

181
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,010
Your Highness!

182
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:24,040
The sword is coated with a deadly poison from Fengrong.

183
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,900
If not purged in time,

184
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:26,720
I fear that Prince Yi...

185
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:28,040
What are you waiting for?

186
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,300
Hurry and detoxify him!

187
00:10:29,300 --> 00:10:30,000
No.

188
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:31,360
This poison is extremely potent and yang in nature.

189
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,450
It must be balanced with the blood of a woman

190
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:35,660
under the purest Yin fate.

191
00:10:35,990 --> 00:10:37,280
We daughters of the Bai family

192
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,780
are born with the purest Yin fate.

193
00:10:38,780 --> 00:10:42,310
It seems the heavens have chosen me to save His Lordship's life.

194
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:44,110
Would you two please step out for a moment?

195
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:45,470
My sister will stay to help me.

196
00:10:45,470 --> 00:10:46,750
I'll draw my own blood for you.

197
00:10:46,750 --> 00:10:47,180
Yes, Your Highness.

198
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:48,310
Yes, Your Highness.

199
00:11:04,210 --> 00:11:07,710
Do you know... who wants to kill Yun Yichen?

200
00:11:07,730 --> 00:11:09,140
It's His Majesty...

201
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:12,000
who fears Prince Yi's Yun's Army?

202
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:13,430
You're wrong.

203
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:16,430
It's the Crown Prince...

204
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:18,260
Pei Yan.

205
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,510
Our third cousin?

206
00:11:21,610 --> 00:11:24,460
Since His Majesty has appointed Pei Yan as the Crown Prince,

207
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,060
he'd never follow the Empress Dowager's wishes

208
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,190
and have Pei Yan marry a woman from our Bai family.

209
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:31,850
But Pei Yan has loved me dearly since childhood,

210
00:11:32,350 --> 00:11:35,430
so he wants to eliminate Yun Yichen

211
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:37,350
to earn favor from His Majesty

212
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:41,110
and exchange that merit to make me his Crown Princess.

213
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,560
Xiyao,

214
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:47,120
you can't abandon Prince Yi.

215
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,660
He has always been deeply devoted to you...

216
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:49,780
You fool.

217
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:52,610
Of course, I don't care about being some empress.

218
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:54,670
Yichen and I have been in love since childhood.

219
00:11:54,670 --> 00:11:56,370
I love him madly.

220
00:11:56,450 --> 00:11:57,910
If I were to die,

221
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:00,010
how could I continue to love him?

222
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:04,690
But you are different.

223
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:06,770
A worthless concubine's daughter.

224
00:12:09,690 --> 00:12:13,490
Haven't you always had feelings for him?

225
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:17,760
So, the blood from your heart...

226
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:22,310
surely you'll offer it

227
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:25,730
willingly, right?

228
00:12:28,490 --> 00:12:30,870
Xi... Xiyao...

229
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,850
The Pei and Yun clans together

230
00:12:32,850 --> 00:12:34,220
built this great realm.

231
00:12:34,410 --> 00:12:35,780
The Pei clan excelled in civil governance,

232
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,310
while the Yun clan mastered martial prowess.

233
00:12:39,020 --> 00:12:40,350
You, traitor,

234
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,820
slew your sovereign and plotted rebellion!

235
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,420
You are a sinner for all ages!

236
00:12:43,430 --> 00:12:45,150
You will die a miserable death!

237
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:46,520
Take him to build the imperial mausoleum.

238
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,560
Let go of me!

239
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,570
Yun Yichen,

240
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:50,650
you will die a miserable death!

241
00:12:50,650 --> 00:12:51,550
Continue reading.

242
00:12:51,550 --> 00:12:53,150
Die a miserable death!

243
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:54,850
Let go of me!

244
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,690
The Pei clan shall rule for a century,

245
00:12:56,690 --> 00:12:59,100
after which the Yun clan shall ascend to the throne.

246
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:00,630
Both clans swear this covenant

247
00:13:00,630 --> 00:13:02,160
and vow never to forsake it.

248
00:13:02,770 --> 00:13:04,470
Should anyone violate this oath,

249
00:13:04,470 --> 00:13:06,530
their entire clan shall be executed.

250
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:10,330
The founding Phoenix Emperor of the Fengqi State,

251
00:13:10,350 --> 00:13:12,100
Pei Yuanjie,

252
00:13:12,330 --> 00:13:14,390
and the non-imperial prince, Yun Han,

253
00:13:14,390 --> 00:13:16,790
hereby establish this covenant together.

254
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:21,000
Long live

255
00:13:21,030 --> 00:13:25,070
Your Majesty!

256
00:13:38,190 --> 00:13:39,390
You've hurt yourself deeply

257
00:13:39,390 --> 00:13:40,740
just to save me.

258
00:13:40,990 --> 00:13:42,910
I owe you too much.

259
00:13:43,280 --> 00:13:44,420
Your Majesty.

260
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,210
Everything I did,

261
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,350
I did out of deep love for you, Your Majesty—

262
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:50,010
willingly and gladly.

263
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:51,480
How can there be any debt?

264
00:13:54,110 --> 00:13:55,790
A mere title of Empress for you is not enough

265
00:13:55,790 --> 00:13:58,850
to honor your family's contribution in supporting me.

266
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:04,290
Whatever reward you want,

267
00:14:04,380 --> 00:14:05,710
I will give it all to you.

268
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,680
To spend this life

269
00:14:07,710 --> 00:14:09,390
beside Your Majesty,

270
00:14:09,630 --> 00:14:11,560
just the two of us, is enough for me.
