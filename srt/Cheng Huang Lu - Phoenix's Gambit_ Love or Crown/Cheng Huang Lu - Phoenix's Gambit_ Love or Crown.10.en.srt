[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,380
[Episode 10]

3
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:48,930
You've entrusted me with an important task.

4
00:00:48,950 --> 00:00:51,450
I dare not disappoint you, Great-aunt.

5
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:52,510
Grandmother.

6
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,640
I'm here to wish you a happy birthday.

7
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:56,440
I present you with a pearl from the South Sea.

8
00:00:56,550 --> 00:00:57,950
May your beauty remain timeless

9
00:00:57,970 --> 00:00:58,870
and your radiance eternal.

10
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:00,890
Very good.

11
00:01:01,880 --> 00:01:04,560
This is a truly exquisite pearl.

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:07,140
To find such a large pearl,

13
00:01:07,160 --> 00:01:09,160
you've put in effort.

14
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,710
You can set it in your crown,

15
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,010
or grind it into powder

16
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,630
for maintaining youthful appearance.

17
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:15,000
Since it's a gift from you,

18
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,960
I can't bear to use it.

19
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:20,890
I will treasure it well.

20
00:01:28,030 --> 00:01:29,060
Grandmother,

21
00:01:29,090 --> 00:01:30,289
Father is in not in good health.

22
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,039
He sent me to deliver the birthday gifts.

23
00:01:32,979 --> 00:01:33,680
Come.

24
00:01:34,390 --> 00:01:37,729
This is a pine of longevity carved from Shoushan stone from Jin'an County.

25
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,120
I wish you longevity like the pine and crane

26
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:41,479
and endless happiness.

27
00:01:41,509 --> 00:01:43,140
Very good.

28
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,850
The Emperor's health is of utmost importance.

29
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,090
Grandmother,

30
00:01:52,120 --> 00:01:52,590
I wish you great fortune

00:01:52,590 --> 00:01:54,170
[Fifth Prince of Fengqi State, Pei Yi]

32
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,130
and longevity.

33
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:57,009
Great.

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,850
Grandmother,

35
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:59,280
may you live long,

36
00:01:59,300 --> 00:02:00,570
maintain youthful,

37
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:00,950
and enjoy happiness, longevity, and good health.

38
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,590
[Sixth Princess of Fengqi State, Pei Rou]

39
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:02,650
May your smile remain forever.

40
00:02:02,680 --> 00:02:04,050
Good.

41
00:02:06,410 --> 00:02:08,970
I present to you a painting by the famous artist Gu Shunzhi from the previous dynasty,

42
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,400
"Empty Mountain and Clear Rain."

43
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:12,450
I wish you heavenly protection

44
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:13,780
and longevity.

45
00:02:17,110 --> 00:02:20,040
It's said that Prince Yi is a military genius.

46
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:23,660
I didn't expect you to have such insight into paintings as well.

47
00:02:24,030 --> 00:02:28,120
This is Gu Shunzhi's best work from his later years.

48
00:02:29,600 --> 00:02:30,670
I'm flattered.

49
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:33,740
I heard that Your Majesty enjoys calligraphy, painting, and music,

50
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,260
so I specifically brought this painting as a present.

51
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:45,540
It's rare for Prince Yi to come.

52
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,430
If you're not feeling well,

53
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:49,590
you may return to your mansion early.

54
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,620
Your Majesty,

55
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:53,770
I am in good health.

56
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:55,600
Thank you for your concern.

57
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,180
Though this year is not a major birthday,

58
00:03:00,470 --> 00:03:03,540
I am very delighted with

59
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,030
today's festivities.

60
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,300
Let the banquet begin.

61
00:03:08,330 --> 00:03:09,690
The banquet begins.

62
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,920
She's arrived outside the hall.

63
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:22,300
Xiyao,

64
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:24,420
what gift have you prepared for Her Majesty?

65
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:28,390
Xiyao has been busy preparing for my birthday banquet.

66
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:30,110
There's no need for gifts.

67
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:32,780
I don't have anything worthy

68
00:03:32,810 --> 00:03:34,420
to present to Your Majesty,

69
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:37,079
so I've prepared a guqin performance to add to the festivities.

70
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,730
Is that so?

71
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:42,020
Since it's Xiyao's sincere intention,

72
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:43,620
let her come up.

73
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:44,380
Yes.

74
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,490
Summon the guqin player.

75
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:51,550
Let Bai Xiyue wear a veil

76
00:03:51,570 --> 00:03:52,900
is to create a sense of mystery.

77
00:03:52,900 --> 00:03:54,730
It's my honor to perform for Your Majesty.

78
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:57,060
It's also a way to get a little revenge

79
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,420
for Bai Xiyao from my last life.

80
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:02,840
I recently came across the score for "Praying to Immortals for Three Lifetimes."

81
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:04,880
I'd like to present it for entertainment.

82
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:06,350
Please allow me, Your Majesty.

83
00:04:06,380 --> 00:04:09,850
I've heard this is a celestial melody.

84
00:04:10,330 --> 00:04:13,630
I didn't expect I would have such fortune.

85
00:04:13,670 --> 00:04:16,430
Xiyue, now begin your performance.

86
00:04:16,579 --> 00:04:17,570
Yes, Your Majesty.

87
00:04:19,810 --> 00:04:20,959
In my previous life,

88
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:23,220
I played the "Praying to Immortals for Three Lifetimes",

89
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,060
astonishing everyone present,

90
00:04:25,170 --> 00:04:27,300
and since then, I became a favorite in the palace.

91
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,060
Well played.

92
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,940
Xiyue has a pair of delicate and skillful hands.

93
00:05:02,020 --> 00:05:04,400
I have a summer retreat

94
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,460
called Qingzhi Pavilion.

95
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:08,200
I'm giving it to you as a reward.

96
00:05:08,230 --> 00:05:10,230
Thank you, Your Majesty.

97
00:05:15,010 --> 00:05:18,060
What piece is this that you're playing?

98
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:21,320
It's the "Praying to Immortals for Three Lifetimes."

99
00:05:21,350 --> 00:05:24,690
I've heard this is a celestial melody.

100
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:28,760
I didn't expect I would have such fortune.

101
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,130
There's even a celestial dance.

102
00:06:16,230 --> 00:06:17,880
Great.

103
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,670
What's going on?

104
00:07:50,350 --> 00:07:52,270
The complete version of "Praying to Immortals for Three Lifetimes"

105
00:07:52,290 --> 00:07:54,159
can actually awaken my immortal consciousness.

106
00:07:54,860 --> 00:07:56,570
Will my identity be exposed?

107
00:07:56,940 --> 00:07:58,770
I was wondering why you were being so kind,

108
00:07:58,870 --> 00:08:01,110
giving me the score and bringing me into the palace.

109
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:03,470
Turns out you wanted me to be your foil.

110
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:04,930
Bai Xiyao,

111
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,280
you're truly killing me with kindness.

112
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:10,280
If Bai Xiyue can't astonish everyone,

113
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,320
how can I pave the way for you in the future?

114
00:08:12,350 --> 00:08:14,290
Excellent.

115
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:16,310
Celestial music paired with celestial dance.

116
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:19,030
I've truly broadened my horizons.

117
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:23,710
Xiyao's gift is my favorite.

118
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,000
So Bai Xiyao's regret

119
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:33,159
was not being able to celebrate the Empress Dowager's birthday in her previous life.

120
00:08:34,450 --> 00:08:35,480
Xiyao,

121
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:38,950
I must reward you well.

122
00:08:48,740 --> 00:08:49,610
Great-aunt,

123
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,260
the one who performed for you

124
00:08:51,410 --> 00:08:53,160
is my sister, Xiyue.

125
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:55,020
Please don't forget her.

126
00:08:56,170 --> 00:08:58,850
She's your half-sister born to a concubine, isn't she?

127
00:08:59,490 --> 00:09:02,300
Why was she wearing a veil just now?

128
00:09:02,330 --> 00:09:03,960
Your Majesty,

129
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:07,040
I believe that playing the guqin should move people with music,

130
00:09:07,100 --> 00:09:08,660
eliminating other distractions

131
00:09:08,710 --> 00:09:10,850
so that the listeners can fully

132
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,480
immerse themselves in the melody.

133
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,170
That makes sense.

134
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:17,730
Come forward.

135
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:20,590
Let me have a good look at you.

136
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:21,960
Yes.

137
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:30,130
Indeed, you are beautiful,

138
00:09:31,050 --> 00:09:35,050
but you lack Xiyao's elegance and nobility.

139
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,550
The current Xiyao

140
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,260
even has an extraordinary immortal aura.

141
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:46,910
Thank you for your favor, Your Majesty.

142
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:49,560
Xiyue has practiced diligently

143
00:09:49,590 --> 00:09:51,350
for a long time to perform for you.

144
00:09:51,480 --> 00:09:54,020
Please do cherish us younger generations.

145
00:09:54,050 --> 00:09:55,450
Very well.

146
00:09:55,520 --> 00:09:58,630
I'll reward Xiyue with a pair of jade and gold bracelets,

147
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,890
to complement her delicate hands.

148
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:04,040
Thank you, Your Majesty.

149
00:10:04,070 --> 00:10:05,000
Xiyao,

150
00:10:05,030 --> 00:10:07,470
I have a summer retreat

151
00:10:07,490 --> 00:10:09,260
called Qingzhi Pavilion.

152
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:11,140
I'm giving it to you as a reward.

153
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:13,740
When you want some peace and quiet,

154
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,000
you can go and stay there.

155
00:10:15,310 --> 00:10:18,820
The scenery there is exquisite.

156
00:10:19,520 --> 00:10:22,110
Thank you, Your Majesty.

157
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:25,320
My sister and I will surely visit Qingzhi Pavilion often

158
00:10:25,620 --> 00:10:27,170
and appreciate your great kindness.

159
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:28,660
After all the twists and turns,

160
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,670
this comfortable and exquisite residence

161
00:10:30,990 --> 00:10:32,320
has been mine in both lives.

162
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,890
You, as an elder sister,

163
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:36,940
truly spoil your younger sister.

164
00:10:37,260 --> 00:10:40,160
Xiyao's humble and uncontentious nature

165
00:10:41,150 --> 00:10:44,230
is just like mine

166
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,230
when I was young.

167
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,130
Did I hear that right?

168
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,600
Empress Dowager,

169
00:10:51,630 --> 00:10:53,160
you didn't say that in your previous life.

170
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:56,980
Your betrothal to Prince Yi was bestowed by His Majesty.

171
00:10:57,270 --> 00:11:00,110
It's not something I can change on a whim.

172
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,260
Great-aunt,

173
00:11:01,290 --> 00:11:02,850
you love me the most.

174
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:06,660
Please ask His Majesty to rescind the order for me.

175
00:11:06,830 --> 00:11:09,050
You're grown up now

176
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:11,990
and shouldn't throw tantrums anymore.

177
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:16,060
The position of Crown Princess that I had arranged for you,

178
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:19,520
you lost it due to your own lack of virtue.

179
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:22,750
Now His Majesty has granted you Prince Yi,

180
00:11:22,780 --> 00:11:24,300
and you're not satisfied either.

181
00:11:24,510 --> 00:11:26,760
Are you trying to drive me to death?

182
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,980
Great-aunt, please calm down.

183
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,370
Don't let anger harm your health.

184
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:34,620
Xiyao has always been undemanding since childhood.

185
00:11:34,650 --> 00:11:35,860
Rather than a royal consort position,

186
00:11:35,980 --> 00:11:37,730
what Xiyao values more is

187
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:40,200
to find a compatible partner.

188
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,420
How can you gain status without competing?

189
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:44,270
How can you receive favor without seizing it?

190
00:11:44,410 --> 00:11:48,070
If I hadn't competed or seized when I was young,

191
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:51,410
how could I have protected our Bai family for three generations?

192
00:11:51,580 --> 00:11:53,890
You've disappointed me too much.

193
00:11:54,510 --> 00:11:55,500
You're

194
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,950
no longer my great-niece.

195
00:11:58,770 --> 00:12:00,280
Indeed, those who are valuable

196
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,410
are always good in every way;

197
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,810
those who are worthless

198
00:12:03,830 --> 00:12:05,500
are wrong no matter what they do.

199
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:06,570
Alright,

200
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:08,000
it's getting late.

201
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,930
I must go back and rest.

202
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,690
Let's

203
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,580
call it a day.

204
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:19,910
Take care, Your Majesty.

205
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,480
Xiyao.

206
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:24,720
Xiyao.

207
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:26,370
It's rare for us brothers to gather,

208
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,730
and our cousins are here too.

209
00:12:27,940 --> 00:12:29,370
It would be a pity

210
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:30,760
to disperse just like this.

211
00:12:31,240 --> 00:12:32,180
Why don't we

212
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,810
go to the Imperial Garden to admire the moon

213
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,050
and have a drink?

214
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:35,910
What do you say?

215
00:12:36,430 --> 00:12:37,230
Xiyao,

216
00:12:37,340 --> 00:12:39,800
you've been busy with the birthday banquet preparations lately.

217
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,150
We haven't had a chance to get together.

218
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,020
How about

219
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:44,140
we celebrate your accomplishments?

220
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,030
The real show is just beginning.

221
00:12:47,050 --> 00:12:48,570
Thank you, Cousin Si and Cousin Yan.

222
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:50,900
I would love that.

223
00:12:53,270 --> 00:12:54,070
Let's go.

224
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:00,310
Why are you going?

225
00:13:00,730 --> 00:13:01,800
If you go, I'll go too.

226
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,800
You...

227
00:13:10,750 --> 00:13:11,730
Prince Yi,

228
00:13:11,750 --> 00:13:14,180
would you mind switching seats with me?

229
00:13:17,880 --> 00:13:18,910
The Eldest Prince

230
00:13:18,930 --> 00:13:20,520
should be sitting in the main seat.

231
00:13:20,710 --> 00:13:22,300
I dare not overstep.

232
00:13:24,530 --> 00:13:25,070
In my previous life,

233
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,870
this guy didn't show up, did he?

234
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:29,370
The situation has become more complicated now.

235
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,130
Xiyue,

236
00:13:33,150 --> 00:13:34,910
it's your first time entering the palace today.

237
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,310
I'd like to propose a toast.

238
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:38,840
Thank you, Cousin Si.

239
00:13:38,990 --> 00:13:40,590
Although I can't hold my liquor well,

240
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:43,120
I must drink this one.

241
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:45,330
Our cousins are not good with wine,

242
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:47,140
so we shouldn't drink too much either.

243
00:13:47,690 --> 00:13:48,520
How about

244
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,120
we play a drinking game?

245
00:13:50,280 --> 00:13:51,810
Whoever loses has to drink.

246
00:13:53,150 --> 00:13:54,450
That would be so boring.

247
00:13:54,860 --> 00:13:56,510
We'll hardly get to drink at all.

248
00:13:56,530 --> 00:13:57,330
I'm not playing.

249
00:13:58,650 --> 00:14:00,150
It adds some elegance.

250
00:14:00,670 --> 00:14:02,100
I think it's a good idea.

251
00:14:05,890 --> 00:14:07,730
Then I'll have to rack my brains

252
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,780
to not lose to you.

253
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:09,400
Alright.

254
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:13,410
I'll follow whatever you say.

255
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:15,870
Alright,

256
00:14:15,890 --> 00:14:17,580
then I'll propose the topic.

257
00:14:17,800 --> 00:14:18,870
In the imperial palace,

258
00:14:18,890 --> 00:14:21,260
there are dragon robes, dragon thrones, and dragon couches.

259
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,590
There are many dragons but few phoenixes.

260
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,930
How about we use

261
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:26,630
"phoenix" as the theme?

262
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:27,920
Who wants to go first?

263
00:14:30,170 --> 00:14:32,480
Let me start with a humble attempt.

264
00:14:34,530 --> 00:14:36,930
Last year at Phoenix Pool,

265
00:14:37,190 --> 00:14:39,460
silver candles lit the night as strings were plucked.

266
00:14:39,720 --> 00:14:40,730
Good.

267
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:42,020
There's a phoenix.

268
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:43,260
The tone and rhyme are balanced.

269
00:14:43,940 --> 00:14:44,740
I'll give it a try too.

270
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,410
The jade flute's sound ceases

271
00:14:47,430 --> 00:14:48,720
at the Phoenix Tower.

272
00:14:49,270 --> 00:14:50,200
Haggard people

273
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,320
bid farewell afterward.

274
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,300
Phoenixes play atop the Phoenix Pavilion.

275
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,930
The phoenix departs, the pavilion empty,

276
00:14:59,420 --> 00:15:01,430
the river flows on its own.

277
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:06,050
After the fall of the old Phoenix City,

278
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:07,840
hairpins were broken, mirrors shattered,

279
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:09,460
and swallows parted ways.

280
00:15:10,520 --> 00:15:11,510
Does it...

281
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,210
have to be ancient poetry,

282
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:16,900
or can it be self-composed?

283
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,190
It can be an impromptu poem,

284
00:15:18,870 --> 00:15:20,900
but it must have a reference.

285
00:15:21,810 --> 00:15:22,610
Well...

286
00:15:24,370 --> 00:15:25,970
I'm not well-versed or knowledgeable enough.

287
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:26,930
I fail.

288
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:28,810
I'll punish myself with a cup of wine.

289
00:15:31,480 --> 00:15:33,340
This is just like in the last life,

290
00:15:33,420 --> 00:15:35,520
using drunkenness to get close to the prince.

291
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,040
Xiyue,

292
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,740
how has your sister been lately?

293
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:42,100
Why hasn't she come to the palace for so long?

294
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,590
My sister has lost her virtue.

295
00:15:45,620 --> 00:15:47,050
Father was furious

296
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,150
and punished her to reflect at home.

297
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:50,960
But...

298
00:15:50,990 --> 00:15:53,440
they didn't find that so-called man, right?

299
00:15:53,490 --> 00:15:55,340
Xiyao must have been wronged.

300
00:15:55,630 --> 00:15:58,360
The royal family and nobles value virtue the most.

301
00:15:58,390 --> 00:15:59,960
The incident of my sister falling into the water

302
00:15:59,990 --> 00:16:01,660
has been spread all over the city.

303
00:16:02,590 --> 00:16:04,530
Fortunately, that man wasn't found.

304
00:16:04,650 --> 00:16:06,380
If he had been found,

305
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,710
other than marrying that man,

306
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:11,090
who else would dare to marry her?

307
00:16:12,630 --> 00:16:14,130
Alright, Xiyue,

308
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,700
don't feel bad for that indecent

309
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:18,130
woman.

310
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:18,710
You...
