[Episode 6]

3
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:48,800
My Lady, please have mercy on me.

4
00:00:50,050 --> 00:00:51,450
Xiyue, you're in such a refined mood today.

5
00:00:53,240 --> 00:00:54,840
Xiyao, you're at home.

6
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:57,690
I thought you were at the palace, helping the Empress Dowager.

7
00:00:57,710 --> 00:00:59,340
I just got back

8
00:00:59,360 --> 00:01:01,160
and heard that you're playing the guqin,

9
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:02,310
so I came to enjoy it.

10
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:03,810
My playing skills are rudimentary and unrefined,

11
00:01:03,830 --> 00:01:05,440
unsuitable for a formal performance.

12
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,780
Indeed, they're not.

13
00:01:09,500 --> 00:01:10,930
However, I

14
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:12,970
could perhaps give you some pointers.

15
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,940
You useless fool, with no sense of what's needed!

16
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,460
Don't you know you should add some ice?

17
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:18,640
I know I'm wrong.

18
00:01:18,830 --> 00:01:19,340
But...

19
00:01:19,370 --> 00:01:20,990
but the ice allotted to you in the storehouse

20
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,050
has already been used up.

21
00:01:22,070 --> 00:01:23,680
Then request more from the household.

22
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,330
You can't even handle such a small matter.

23
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:27,020
How can you be my personal maid?

24
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,750
In this scorching summer,

25
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:30,440
ice is already in short supply

26
00:01:30,470 --> 00:01:31,440
throughout the capital.

27
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:33,550
Lianxin,

28
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:35,880
go instruct the storehouse

29
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,440
to spare a couple of pieces

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,180
of my share for Second Miss.

31
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,270
Also, have the kitchen prepare some iced desserts.

32
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:42,530
Yes, my Lady.

33
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:44,880
I've caused you unnecessary expense, Xiyao.

34
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:54,039
Xiyue, the tune you're playing, "Praying to Immortals for Three Lifetimes,"

35
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:55,740
is not the complete version.

36
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:58,580
In fact, the score circulating in the capital

37
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:01,120
has some mistakes and incorrect notes.

38
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:04,330
Xiyao, you know this tune?

39
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:06,090
I more than merely know it.

40
00:02:06,290 --> 00:02:07,750
It won't be until three years later

41
00:02:07,780 --> 00:02:09,680
that someone will discover the complete musical score

42
00:02:09,710 --> 00:02:11,400
in the ancient archives of the previous dynasty.

43
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,480
I acquired it by chance.

44
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,180
I can teach you if you'd like.

45
00:02:19,880 --> 00:02:21,290
I wouldn't dare impose on you, Xiyao.

46
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,250
It's just a pastime for me.

47
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:24,750
Even if I master it,

48
00:02:24,770 --> 00:02:26,380
who would be there to listen?

49
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:28,470
You could perform it

50
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,770
for the Empress Dowager in the palace.

51
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:36,100
Xiyao, you jest.

52
00:02:36,130 --> 00:02:38,130
I'm not fortunate enough for such an honor.

53
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:40,220
You know Pei Yan has always favored me.

54
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,880
I can ask him

55
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,770
to get you a pass to enter the palace.

56
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:48,320
When the time comes,

57
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,530
I'll bring you to the birthday banquet

58
00:02:50,579 --> 00:02:51,680
so you can perform

59
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,290
for the Empress Dowager in public.

60
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:03,810
Xiyao, what do you truly want?

61
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,740
I've already sent Lianxin off.

62
00:03:07,880 --> 00:03:08,850
What do you think?

63
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,300
Xiyao, you must have misunderstood something.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:24,700
How could Lianxin be disloyal to you?

65
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:26,329
After all, she's served you for 10 years.

66
00:03:27,610 --> 00:03:29,860
Since you won't help ease my burden,

67
00:03:29,890 --> 00:03:31,760
I'll no longer disturb your practice.

68
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:32,840
Wait, Xiyao.

69
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:36,840
I did hear from old Steward Gui

70
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:38,960
mention some things about Lianxin.

71
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:42,570
Didn't he retire and return to his hometown?

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:44,180
What did he say?

73
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,260
It's about something from your childhood.

74
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,030
Everyone, please don't rush.

75
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,930
Each of you will get a bowl of porridge

76
00:03:50,950 --> 00:03:52,020
and a steamed bun.

77
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:53,400
Here you go. Be careful. It's hot.

78
00:03:53,420 --> 00:03:54,430
Steward Gui,

79
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:55,750
we're out of steamed buns.

80
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,280
Please bring two more baskets.

81
00:03:57,520 --> 00:03:58,579
Yes, Lady Xiyao.

82
00:04:00,380 --> 00:04:01,220
Thank you.

00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,170
Ma'am,

85
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,070
are they giving out food here?

86
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:06,440
Yes.

87
00:04:06,470 --> 00:04:08,550
Today, the eldest daughter of the Bai family

88
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,900
is distributing porridge to refugees.

89
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,700
Hurry and get some.

Thank you.

00:04:27,770 --> 00:04:28,860
Okay,

94
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,690
brother.

00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:30,690
I'll wait for you.

00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:36,320
Brother, I... I'm scared.

97
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:41,440
Thank you.

00:04:44,600 --> 00:04:45,200
Thank you.

Thank you.

100
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:51,450
Beat him!

101
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:52,730
Beat this lowlife

102
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,260
to a pulp!

What are you doing?

104
00:04:55,330 --> 00:04:56,460
Stop hitting him!

110
00:05:07,930 --> 00:05:08,940
Let go of me!

Brother!

114
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:15,060
I just heard Steward Gui mention casually

115
00:05:15,300 --> 00:05:16,720
that Lianxin's appearance

116
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,900
is very similar to that of the little girl back then.

117
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,020
What happened to that little mute boy?

118
00:05:26,950 --> 00:05:28,420
He was beaten to death, of course.

119
00:05:28,610 --> 00:05:30,240
After all, he offended you.

120
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:32,350
Those servants surely

121
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:34,130
wouldn't have held back.

122
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:37,720
You're saying that I, Bai Xiyao,

123
00:05:37,750 --> 00:05:39,580
caused Lianxin's brother's death?

124
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:42,880
Xiyao, you don't need to blame yourself.

125
00:05:42,909 --> 00:05:44,409
He was just a little beggar, after all.

126
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:45,570
Even though he was beaten to death,

127
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:46,360
no one would dare to speak

128
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:48,190
against our family, the household of the Minister of Rites.

129
00:05:49,570 --> 00:05:51,740
Looks like that Lianxin has been in our household for so many years

130
00:05:52,860 --> 00:05:54,990
just to seek revenge for her brother.

131
00:05:55,130 --> 00:05:57,150
Then, I don't understand.

132
00:05:57,390 --> 00:05:59,450
If there is such a deep grudge,

133
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:01,140
how could Lianxin still enter our household

134
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:02,310
to serve you as a maid?

135
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:05,110
Steward Gui must have mistaken her due to his failing eyesight.

136
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:07,700
I will investigate the truth of this matter.

137
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,430
I'll have a copy of the music score and send it to your quarters.

138
00:06:10,780 --> 00:06:12,590
You should practice more these days.

139
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:14,180
Don't embarrass our family

140
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:15,750

00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,980
Thank you for your support, sister.

143
00:06:22,830 --> 00:06:25,060
prepare for the deadly showdown

144
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,480
between you and your maid.

145
00:06:26,890 --> 00:06:27,790
My Lord,

146
00:06:27,820 --> 00:06:29,290
stop staring at it and dwelling on past memories.

147
00:06:29,310 --> 00:06:30,260
It's time to take your medicine.

148
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:48,610
You earned a military post for your achievements in war,

149
00:06:48,640 --> 00:06:50,100
yet you refused to accept it.

150
00:06:50,390 --> 00:06:52,070
You insisted on serving me.

151
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,860
Do you just want to watch me make a fool of myself?

152
00:06:54,890 --> 00:06:55,860
I wouldn't dare, my Lord.

153
00:06:56,090 --> 00:06:58,310
I simply wish to serve you for life, my Lord.

154
00:06:58,370 --> 00:06:59,950
No matter how high the position offered, I don't want it.

155
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:02,330
You...

156
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,780
When I saved you back then,

157
00:07:03,810 --> 00:07:05,660
I shouldn't have healed your throat.

158
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,340
I should have let you remain mute.

159
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:08,670
You'd be less talkative.

160
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,980
My voice was given to me by you, my Lord.

161
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,630
Even this life of mine was given by you.

162
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:14,260
That's ancient history.

163
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:15,830
Why bring that up?

164
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,490
It's just that your sister

165
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:21,260
still hasn't been found.

166
00:07:22,450 --> 00:07:23,780
Now that we're in the capital,

167
00:07:24,700 --> 00:07:26,200
send more people to search for her.

168
00:07:26,230 --> 00:07:27,400
There should be some information soon.

169
00:07:29,190 --> 00:07:30,120
Tao Yu will never forget

170
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:31,480
My Lord's kindness, not even in death.

171
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:32,990
Get up.

172
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:39,159
How's it going with the matter

173
00:07:39,180 --> 00:07:40,200
I asked you to investigate?

174
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,130
My Lord,

175
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:43,020
10 years ago, only the heiress of the Minister of Rites,

176
00:07:43,050 --> 00:07:44,450
Bai Xiyao, frequented the palace

177
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:45,409
to attend to the Empress Dowager.

178
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:47,490
The concubine-born daughter, Bai Xiyue,

179
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:48,820
never entered the palace.

180
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:51,600
Since it's her,

181
00:07:52,159 --> 00:07:53,620
why was she afraid to admit who she is to me?

182
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:55,610
And even had her sister pretend to be her.

183
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:58,260
The Minister of Rites is determined to have his daughter marry a prince.

184
00:07:58,730 --> 00:08:01,290
The Empress Dowager also hopes for another queen from the Bai family.

185
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:03,540
She might be waiting in her boudoir to be married...

186
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:06,130
so she doesn't want any entanglement with you, my Lord.

187
00:08:07,040 --> 00:08:08,690
That's their thinking.

188
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:14,260
I want to know what Bai Xiyao thinks.

189
00:08:14,850 --> 00:08:16,970
Why don't you go ask her yourself, my Lord?

190
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:19,290
If Bai Xiyao truly wants to be the queen,

191
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:21,630
you could give her the position in the future.

192
00:08:21,650 --> 00:08:22,450
Nonsense.

193
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,310
I want revenge,

194
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,400
not rebellion.

195
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:28,130
Alright, you may leave.

196
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:29,360
You're so noisy.

197
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:30,420
One more thing, one more thing.

198
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:31,480
I've received news

199
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:32,570
that tomorrow, Bai Xiyao

200
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:34,370
will be distributing porridge at the charity hall on the outskirts of the capital.

201
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,059
It's said to be for the Empress Dowager's birthday,

202
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,360
doing good deeds and praying for blessings.

203
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:39,970
Distributing porridge at the charity hall?

204
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:42,299
[Jishi Hall]

205
00:08:42,299 --> 00:08:43,620
Come on, this way.

206
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:44,910
Thank you, noble lady.

207
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:45,470
Alright.

208
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:48,630
Here, take this.

209
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:49,430
Thank you.

210
00:08:49,610 --> 00:08:50,860
You truly have a heart of gold.

211
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,680
You're welcome.

212
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:52,840
May the Empress Dowager be blessed with longevity and good health.

213
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:54,150
No need to rush. There's enough for everyone.

214
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,580
- May the Empress Dowager be blessed with longevity and good health.
-Here you go.

215
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:57,540
Lianxin!

216
00:08:58,620 --> 00:08:59,500
Thank you.

217
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,430
Thank you.

218
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,260
Thank you so much.

219
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,060
Here you go.

220
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:05,860
Thank you.

221
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,050
Thank you, Eldest Miss Bai.

222
00:09:07,070 --> 00:09:07,600
Come on.

223
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:10,840
My Lady,

224
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:11,830
please take a break.

225
00:09:11,990 --> 00:09:13,290
Yes, Benefactor Bai.

226
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:14,970
We've prepared some tea.

227
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:16,310
Please take a break.

228
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:18,940
I'll take this opportunity

229
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:20,620
to talk to Lianxin

230
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,120
and clear up the misunderstanding from years ago.

231
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,480
Then I'll go rest for a while.

232
00:09:24,510 --> 00:09:25,100
Lianxin,

233
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:25,990
please take over for me.

234
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:27,120
Yes, my Lady.

235
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:29,580
Thank you, noble lady.

236
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,590
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

237
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:34,790
Such a kind person.

238
00:09:34,790 --> 00:09:35,430
Good person.

239
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:36,920
May the Empress Dowager be blessed with longevity and good health.

240
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:37,940
Thank you.

241
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,220
Thank you.

242
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,240
Thank you, Eldest Miss Bai.

243
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:44,560
I...

244
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,020
I'm not the Eldest Miss Bai.

245
00:09:47,020 --> 00:09:48,020
Thank you.

246
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:49,120
Thank you, Eldest Miss Bai.

247
00:09:49,150 --> 00:09:50,470
Our young lady is over there.

248
00:09:50,470 --> 00:09:51,550
Thank you, Miss.

249
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:53,290
Okay.

250
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:55,510
Thank you.

251
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:56,490
Thank you, Miss.

252
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:57,790
Please take a couple more.

253
00:09:58,930 --> 00:10:00,440
I'm not the Eldest Miss Bai.

254
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:02,720
Thank you.

255
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,150
I'm not the Eldest Miss Bai.

256
00:10:04,340 --> 00:10:05,620
I'm just her maid.

257
00:10:07,870 --> 00:10:09,670
Thank you, Eldest Miss Bai.

258
00:10:13,660 --> 00:10:14,800
Thank you.

259
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:17,320
Thank you, noble lady.

260
00:10:20,080 --> 00:10:21,310
May you live a long life.

261
00:10:24,550 --> 00:10:25,980
Thank you, noble lady.

262
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:27,850
Thank you, noble lady.

263
00:10:28,730 --> 00:10:29,730
May you have many children and blessings.

264
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:31,090
May you be blessed with longevity and good health.

265
00:10:31,970 --> 00:10:32,930
Such a kind person.

266
00:10:32,930 --> 00:10:34,120
Thank you, Eldest Miss Bai.

267
00:10:34,260 --> 00:10:35,500
Thank you, thank you, Eldest Miss Bai.

268
00:10:35,620 --> 00:10:37,430
I'll go attend to my lady.

269
00:10:37,450 --> 00:10:38,390
I'll leave this in your hands.

270
00:10:38,410 --> 00:10:39,460
It's my duty.

271
00:10:39,490 --> 00:10:40,450
Thank you.

272
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:41,710
Such a good person.

273
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:42,570
This way.

274
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,430
Hand over the food.

275
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:45,300
No, I can't.

276
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,600
My wife is waiting at home

277
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:47,820
for this meal

278
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:48,900
to survive!

279
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:50,230
You old fools.

280
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,690
You already have one foot in the grave.

281
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:52,920
What's the point of living any longer?

282
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:53,700
Better to let us younger ones

283
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,780
eat our fill!

284
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:56,760
Thank you, kind sir.

285
00:10:56,790 --> 00:10:57,260
My Lady,

286
00:10:57,280 --> 00:10:58,670
are you in there?

287
00:10:59,510 --> 00:11:00,660
Thank you, kind sir.

288
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,070
May you have many children and blessings.

289
00:11:06,430 --> 00:11:07,900
Do you want us brothers

290
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:08,900
to send you off to your grave?

291
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,760
Stop!

292
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:11,990
Are you alright?

293
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:17,130
Have you no shame,

294
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:18,670
stealing food from an old man!

295
00:11:19,580 --> 00:11:20,800
Little beauty,

296
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,690
there are rules here!

297
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:24,630
That's right.

298
00:11:26,410 --> 00:11:26,990
Miss,

299
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:27,700
you called for me?

300
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:28,630
What are your orders?

301
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:33,100
Bai Xiyao already knows you want revenge against her.

302
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:34,090
How is that possible?

303
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:35,350
She's going to the charity hall tomorrow.

304
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,870
That's your last chance.

305
00:11:37,130 --> 00:11:38,490
Either she dies

306
00:11:38,510 --> 00:11:39,670
or you die.

307
00:11:39,720 --> 00:11:40,600
What...

308
00:11:40,630 --> 00:11:42,120
what should I do?

309
00:11:42,990 --> 00:11:44,730
The area around the charity hall is chaotic.

310
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:46,240
Find an opportunity

311
00:11:46,260 --> 00:11:47,620
and finish her with one strike.

312
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:49,030
I...

313
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,590
I...

314
00:11:52,820 --> 00:11:54,530
When she was distributing porridge back then,

315
00:11:54,550 --> 00:11:56,080
she caused your brother's death.

316
00:11:56,210 --> 00:11:57,940
Now, as she distributes porridge again,

317
00:11:58,200 --> 00:11:59,990
it's time for you to avenge your family.

318
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:02,450
Heaven's justice really comes full circle.

319
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,160
Kill her!

320
00:12:07,490 --> 00:12:09,190
Kill... kill her.

321
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:17,830
Mind your own business!

322
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,810
If I use my celestial power here,

323
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:21,410
I might faint again afterward.

324
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,290
I can't use it unless absolutely necessary.

325
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:24,430
Shame?

326
00:12:24,770 --> 00:12:26,590
We brothers will show you

327
00:12:26,630 --> 00:12:28,870
what real shame is.

328
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,800
Miss, don't worry about me.

329
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:30,700
Run quickly.

330
00:12:31,320 --> 00:12:32,690
I am the eldest daughter of the Minister of Rites!

331
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,800
If you harm me,

332
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:35,000
you will suffer serious consequences!

333
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,930
Boss, it's her.

334
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,060
Let's abduct her.

335
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:38,830
Let's do it!

336
00:12:41,050 --> 00:12:42,530
Are you alright, Boss?

337
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:43,450
Revenge...

338
00:12:45,420 --> 00:12:47,290
I must avenge my brother.

339
00:12:48,280 --> 00:12:50,270
This chick has some martial arts skills.

340
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,700
Kill this little wench!

341
00:12:51,750 --> 00:12:53,430
Brothers, let's go together!

342
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:54,840
Miss!

343
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:55,600
Let go of me!

344
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:57,290
Who are you people?

345
00:13:02,350 --> 00:13:03,280
Get lost.

346
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:04,450
I said, get lost!

347
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:05,240
Help me...

348
00:13:05,270 --> 00:13:06,320
Run!

349
00:13:06,970 --> 00:13:07,970
My Lady,

350
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,730
run!

351
00:13:09,050 --> 00:13:09,840
Thank you.

352
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,220
Thank you, Eldest Miss Bai and this young lady.

353
00:13:14,410 --> 00:13:15,240
Lianxin,

354
00:13:15,490 --> 00:13:16,350
it's alright now.

355
00:13:16,370 --> 00:13:17,730
I'll take you home.

356
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:19,690
No!

357
00:13:19,810 --> 00:13:20,910
I'm going to kill you!

358
00:13:20,930 --> 00:13:22,630
I need to avenge my brother!

359
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,480
Lianxin.

360
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:25,190
I'm also very sorry about what happened to your brother back then.

361
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:25,690
But back then...

362
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:26,350
Sorry?

363
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:28,720
Can an apology bring my brother back to life?

364
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,230
I want you to pay with your life!

365
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:33,080
Lianxin.

366
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,450
The one you should kill is Bai Xiyue.

367
00:13:35,500 --> 00:13:36,550
You've been deceived by her.

368
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:37,610
Nonsense!

369
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:40,310
Second Miss Xiyue is helping me get revenge.

370
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,400
Don't try to drive a wedge between us.

371
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:45,480
Remember when you were helping me serve porridge earlier,

372
00:13:45,510 --> 00:13:47,540
and everyone called you "Eldest Miss Bai"?

373
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:50,310
What exactly are you trying to say?

374
00:13:50,330 --> 00:13:51,770
I'll tell you

375
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:54,580
the part that Bai Xiyue dares not tell you.

376
00:13:54,610 --> 00:13:56,150
Everyone, please don't rush.

377
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:58,530
Each of you will get a bowl of porridge

378
00:13:58,550 --> 00:13:59,720
and a steamed bun.

379
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:00,330
See?

380
00:14:00,350 --> 00:14:01,620
Mom will distract her in a moment.

381
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,010
Then you go and serve porridge in place of your sister.

382
00:14:03,030 --> 00:14:03,830
Be good.

383
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,730
I don't want to!

384
00:14:05,760 --> 00:14:06,920
They're so dirty!

385
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:08,120
They stink!

386
00:14:08,140 --> 00:14:09,130
Silly girl,

387
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:10,400
you need to earn a good reputation

388
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,020
so that you can marry into a good family in the future.

389
00:14:12,050 --> 00:14:13,470
Even if you don't want to, you must bear with it.

390
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:15,870
Let's go.

391
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,350
Thank you, Eldest Miss.

392
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:18,780
Xiyao,

393
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:19,860
go and rest for a while.

394
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:20,620
Don't tire yourself out.

395
00:14:20,650 --> 00:14:22,340
Madam, I'm not tired.

396
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:24,770
I heard that the Duke's son is leaving for the frontier today.

397
00:14:24,790 --> 00:14:26,420
Aren't you kind of friends with him?

398
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,350
He's leaving?

399
00:14:28,630 --> 00:14:29,900
I'll trouble you to take care of things here, Madam.

400
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:31,230
I need to go out for a while.

401
00:14:32,130 --> 00:14:32,860
Lady Xiyao?

402
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,060
Come on, hurry and distribute.

403
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,280
I'll go invite some ladies from noble families to come and see.

404
00:14:36,300 --> 00:14:37,500
Be good, okay?

405
00:14:38,070 --> 00:14:39,090
Alright.

406
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:40,030
Here you go.

407
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:40,610
Thank you.

408
00:14:40,660 --> 00:14:41,430
Take care.

409
00:14:41,430 --> 00:14:42,830
Okay, okay, okay.

410
00:14:42,830 --> 00:14:43,310
Thank you.

411
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,100
No need to rush.

412
00:14:44,180 --> 00:14:44,740
Thank you.

413
00:14:44,770 --> 00:14:45,380
There's enough for everyone.

414
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,240
There's enough for everyone.

415
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:46,730
Come on.

416
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:48,050
Thank you, Eldest Miss.

417
00:14:48,530 --> 00:14:49,300
Why are you pushing?

418
00:14:49,300 --> 00:14:50,200
Stay away from me!

419
00:14:51,260 --> 00:14:53,010
Here, be careful.

420
00:14:53,190 --> 00:14:53,900
Okay.

421
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:54,510
Come on.

422
00:14:54,530 --> 00:14:56,140
Thank you, Miss Bai.

423
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:06,400
Everyone can only take one, okay?

424
00:15:09,830 --> 00:15:10,710
What's going on here?

425
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,730
You filthy creature!

426
00:15:14,980 --> 00:15:15,990
How dare you splash me!

427
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,290
Catch him!

428
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:19,870
Beat him!

429
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,460
-Stinking brat, how dare you splash our young lady?
-Beat this lowlife to a pulp!

430
00:15:21,460 --> 00:15:22,260
What are you doing?

431
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:23,860
Stop hitting him!

432
00:15:23,860 --> 00:15:25,060
Brother!

433
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,490
Brother!

434
00:15:26,520 --> 00:15:27,290
You little mute!

435
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,900
How dare you splash our young lady!

436
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:30,890
Don't grab the buns!

437
00:15:30,890 --> 00:15:31,890
Don't grab the buns! You all!

438
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:34,940
Brother! Brother!

439
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,450
Let go of me!

440
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:38,490
Brother!

441
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:39,400
Don't go get yourself killed!

442
00:15:39,430 --> 00:15:40,730
I'll take you somewhere where you can eat your fill!

443
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:41,490
My Lady,

444
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:43,090
this little beggar seems to be dying.

445
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,120
Take him far away.

446
00:15:44,140 --> 00:15:45,710
Don't let him sully the threshold here.

447
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:55,080
Lianxin,

448
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,750
think carefully.

449
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:59,030
When your brother was being beaten back then,

450
00:15:59,050 --> 00:16:00,950
was it my face that you saw?

451
00:16:00,980 --> 00:16:02,100
It was you!

452
00:16:02,130 --> 00:16:03,540
There's no way I remembered it wrong!
