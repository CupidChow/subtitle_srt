00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:46,330
[Episode 3]

3
00:00:46,690 --> 00:00:48,500
I am Yuanhuang Palace's

4
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:49,670
Bai Hong.

5
00:00:49,700 --> 00:00:50,230
My Lady.

6
00:00:50,470 --> 00:00:51,390
I am not Bai Xiyao.

7
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:52,660
My Lady, what's wrong?

8
00:00:52,780 --> 00:00:53,430
It's Bai Hong.

9
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:54,980
My Lady, are you alright?

10
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:56,390
My Lady.

11
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,600
I'm fine.

12
00:01:04,650 --> 00:01:06,250
Help me up.

13
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:07,230
Yes, My Lady.

14
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,140
I was just too hungry

15
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:14,630
and had a dream.

16
00:01:15,250 --> 00:01:16,050
Slow down.

17
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:23,510
Could it be because Bai Xiyao is of mortal flesh

18
00:01:23,539 --> 00:01:25,100
and couldn't bear my spell?

19
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,120
Looks like this celestial power

20
00:01:27,140 --> 00:01:28,700
cannot be used lightly again.

21
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:36,100
Delicious.

22
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,880
My Lady, please eat slowly.

23
00:01:40,030 --> 00:01:42,660
Why does it have to be this useless Bai Xiyao?

24
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:44,229
Immortal Master,

25
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:46,330
you truly leave me no path to survive.

26
00:01:48,170 --> 00:01:49,000
My Lady,

27
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:50,509
I nearly caused you

28
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:51,550
to lose your virtue yesterday.

29
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:52,990
Please punish me.

30
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,680
You didn't say anything wrong.

31
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,570
Someone deliberately slandered me.

32
00:01:58,930 --> 00:02:00,240
I won't blame you.

33
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:04,820
Yes, thank you for your insight, My Lady.

34
00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:06,150
When you fainted,

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,530
I was decocting medicine in the kitchen.

36
00:02:07,550 --> 00:02:08,919
Taozhi came to speak with me,

37
00:02:08,949 --> 00:02:11,500
which led Lady Xiyue to learn about your fall into the water.

38
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,380
I see.

39
00:02:14,960 --> 00:02:17,500
Did you see that gentleman's face clearly?

40
00:02:18,390 --> 00:02:19,910
I did not see it.

41
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,070
In my past life, Lianxin said the same.

42
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,660
It seems to be true.

43
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,460
Get up.

44
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,930
Lianxin,

45
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,820
you grew up with me.

46
00:02:32,150 --> 00:02:33,780
We should look out for each other

47
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,260
and not be harmed by others.

48
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:36,320
Don't you agree?

49
00:02:38,650 --> 00:02:39,880
Yes, My Lady.

50
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:41,190
I understand.

51
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:43,140
From now on, I swear to protect you with my life

52
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:45,280
and remain loyal to you forever.

53
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:47,740
Then go prepare some hot water.

54
00:02:47,770 --> 00:02:48,700
I want to rest.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,960
Yes, My Lady.

56
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:51,440
I will go now.

57
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,590
Father, when can I enter the palace?

58
00:03:08,630 --> 00:03:09,780
Xiyue, don't worry.

59
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,220
I'll plead with the Empress Dowager again

60
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:13,780
to make sure you get the chance to meet the Third Prince.

61
00:03:13,810 --> 00:03:16,390
The Empress Dowager's birthday is coming soon.

62
00:03:16,420 --> 00:03:17,750
If I can't go this time,

63
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:19,620
who knows when the next chance will be.

64
00:03:19,730 --> 00:03:20,450
Don't be afraid.

65
00:03:20,470 --> 00:03:22,130
His Highness, Prince Yi, has arrived.

66
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,510
Why is Prince Yi here?

67
00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:24,630
He just returned to the capital.

68
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:26,329
why come to our Bai family so soon?

69
00:03:32,350 --> 00:03:34,020
Greetings, Your Highness.

70
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:35,070
Bring it up.

71
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,870
Lord Bai, rise.

72
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:39,380
Please.

73
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:51,610
Thank you, Your Highness.

74
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:00,320
Th-This...

75
00:04:00,350 --> 00:04:01,100
This...

76
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:09,130
Xiyao,

77
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:10,870
aren't you going to greet His Highness?

78
00:04:11,140 --> 00:04:13,740
In my past life, when Yun Yichen came to the Bai family,

79
00:04:14,060 --> 00:04:15,680
Bai Xiyao had lost her virtue

80
00:04:15,710 --> 00:04:17,519
and was locked up in the woodshed.

81
00:04:18,630 --> 00:04:19,620
Bring it up.

82
00:04:19,820 --> 00:04:21,560
Greetings, Your Highness.

83
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:23,160
Lord Bai, rise.

84
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:24,000
Please.

85
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:29,680
Thank you, Your Highness.

86
00:04:33,159 --> 00:04:34,550
Your Highness,

87
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,820
what brings you

88
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,800
to our humble home today?

89
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:37,580
When I was young,

90
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:39,750
I had a good relationship with the Bai family's young lady.

91
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:40,900
Nonsense! A non-imperial prince?

92
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:43,150
Just a wild bastard without parents.

93
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:44,659
You cursed your father to death and drove your mother to suicide.

94
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:45,930
You jinx!

95
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:47,420
Go, go, go! Don't play with him.

96
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:47,770
Fat as a pig.

97
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:49,070
[Young Yun Yichen]

98
00:04:49,909 --> 00:04:51,470
You're not allowed to bully him!

99
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:52,630
So many against one,

100
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:53,800
aren't you ashamed?

101
00:04:53,830 --> 00:04:54,240
Big Brother, you're bullying someone younger.

102
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,540
[Young Pei Yan]

103
00:04:55,540 --> 00:04:56,810
Aren't you afraid Father will punish you?

104
00:04:56,840 --> 00:04:56,900
Yan, mind your own business.

105
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:58,830
[Young Pei Si]

106
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,060
[Young Bai Xiyao]

107
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:01,100
Are you alright?

108
00:05:05,780 --> 00:05:07,570
Cousin, where are you going?

109
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,130
It's been ten years.

110
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:10,460
Today's visit

111
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:11,940
is just to deliver some thank-you gifts.

112
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:13,860
Open them all.

113
00:05:21,880 --> 00:05:22,980
Y-Your Highness...

114
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:23,390
This...

115
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:24,680
These gifts are too generous.

116
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:27,250
It feels undeserving.

117
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:33,530
I, Commoner Bai Xiyue, greets Your Highness.

118
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:36,340
Miss Bai, do you still remember childhood memories?

119
00:05:36,760 --> 00:05:37,780
In my past life,

120
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:39,300
I was so envious of Bai Xiyao

121
00:05:39,330 --> 00:05:40,659
for being able to visit the palace

122
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:43,810
and often pestered her to tell me stories of the court.

123
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:46,060
Thanks to the Empress Dowager's favor,

124
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,430
I used to visit the palace often as a child.

125
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:50,950
I remember a Brother Yichen

126
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:53,480
who always called me Little Bai.

127
00:05:58,300 --> 00:06:00,590
My name is Yun Yichen. What's yours?

128
00:06:00,790 --> 00:06:01,730
Brother Yichen,

129
00:06:01,730 --> 00:06:03,500
just call me Little Bai.

130
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:05,250
From now on, we're friends.

131
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:07,290
Really, Little Bai?

132
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:09,730
You're my first friend in the capital.

133
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:17,110
So I pretended to recognize Yun Yichen

134
00:06:17,130 --> 00:06:19,060
based on memory.

135
00:06:20,660 --> 00:06:21,680
Back then,

136
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,290
I had no elders at home.

137
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,690
It was my aunt, Consort Xian, who raised me.

138
00:06:25,910 --> 00:06:27,310
Little Bai, you now

139
00:06:27,340 --> 00:06:29,060
should have come of age, right?

140
00:06:29,180 --> 00:06:30,310
Your Highness,

141
00:06:30,330 --> 00:06:32,210
I came of age just last month.

142
00:06:33,950 --> 00:06:34,950
Lord Bai,

143
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,860
is your daughter betrothed?

144
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:38,600
My daughter

145
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,020
is not yet engaged.

146
00:06:49,790 --> 00:06:50,840
Lord Bai,

147
00:06:51,260 --> 00:06:53,960
I wish to marry Bai Xiyue as his wife.

148
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:55,800
This...

149
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,010
Greetings, Your Highness.

150
00:07:14,950 --> 00:07:16,380
The person I saved that day

151
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,130
turned out to also be a daughter of the Bai family.

152
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:25,870
When I was young,

153
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:28,050
I had a good relationship with the Bai family's young lady.

154
00:07:28,070 --> 00:07:29,370
It's been ten years.

155
00:07:30,070 --> 00:07:31,270
Today's visit

156
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,070
is just to deliver some thank-you gifts.

157
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,340
May I ask, Your Highness,

158
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:36,200
which of my daughters you are here for?

159
00:07:38,270 --> 00:07:40,050
Then just let Bai Xiyue have him.

160
00:07:40,280 --> 00:07:41,200
Yun Yichen

161
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:43,440
is her stepping stone to become the empress.

162
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:50,170
Xiyue, are you going to admit it or not?

163
00:07:51,090 --> 00:07:52,380
Why should I?

164
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,900
If you marry Yun Yichen,

165
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,909
I might get a chance to marry the Third Prince.

166
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,340
Why do neither of the sisters

167
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:58,870
want to admit it?

168
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:00,320
My virtue is intact.

169
00:08:00,350 --> 00:08:02,090
I'm destined to marry a prince.

170
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:04,580
Climbing up to the Duke is your only shot at marrying higher.

171
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,460
Seems

172
00:08:11,480 --> 00:08:12,780
I was mistaken.

173
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:15,560
The one I seek isn't the Bai family's daughter.

174
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,560
Today's visit never happened.

175
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,370
Lord Bai,

176
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,090
sorry for the disturbance.

177
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:23,220
Tao Yu, return to the manor.

178
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:24,240
It's me.

179
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,740
You...

180
00:08:31,050 --> 00:08:33,030
Was it the elder or younger sister?

181
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:34,570
I didn't hear clearly.

182
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:35,880
Don't make a fuss.

183
00:08:35,909 --> 00:08:38,240
Don't speak recklessly in front of the Duke!

184
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:46,800
Commoner Bai Xiyao

185
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:48,330
greets Your Highness.

186
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,800
You're the Little Bai?

187
00:08:55,020 --> 00:08:56,830
My younger sister received the Empress Dowager's favor

188
00:08:56,860 --> 00:08:58,260
and often went to the palace.

189
00:08:58,600 --> 00:08:59,740
She told me

190
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:02,160
there was a Brother Yichen who called her Little Bai.

191
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:05,330
Since this young lady is the Little Bai,

192
00:09:05,350 --> 00:09:06,330
then why

193
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:07,690
did you also admit to it?

194
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:11,490
Just now I meant...

195
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:12,520
I meant...

196
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:13,990
It was my younger sister.

197
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,730
She had concerns,

198
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,330
so she replied slowly.

199
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,080
Concerns?

200
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,750
Being childhood friends with me,

201
00:09:23,970 --> 00:09:26,080
what is there to hide?

202
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:30,110
Girls' reputation is of utmost importance.

203
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:33,350
My younger sister wishes that, after her coming-of-age ceremony,

204
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:35,230
the past would never be mentioned again,

205
00:09:35,260 --> 00:09:36,860
for fear it might affect her future marriage prospects.

206
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,660
As my elder sister, Xiyao understands me well.

207
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:44,510
Lord Bai,

208
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:47,050
is your esteemed daughter engaged to be married?

209
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:48,710
I'm not yet betrothed.

210
00:09:55,150 --> 00:09:56,180
Oh no,

211
00:09:56,210 --> 00:09:57,760
I completely forgot that if Yun Yichen

212
00:09:57,790 --> 00:09:59,140
seeks to marry Bai Xiyue...

213
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:01,630
Prince Yi, your great victory over Fengrong

214
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:03,620
has brought great merit to the nation.

215
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:04,230
I shall reward you generously.

216
00:10:04,230 --> 00:10:05,480
[Head of Fengqi State – Emperor]

217
00:10:06,910 --> 00:10:08,420
This humble servant dares not take credit.

218
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:09,590
It is all thanks to

219
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,210
the Yun's Army,

220
00:10:11,230 --> 00:10:12,550
guarding the borders

221
00:10:12,570 --> 00:10:13,470
without fear of life or death.

222
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:15,780
I merely...

223
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,710
What a fine Yun's Army,

224
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,740
truly admirable.

225
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:23,780
Now that the border is secure,

226
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:26,370
Prince Yi, you

227
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:30,960
shall remain in the capital to recover from your injuries.

228
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,620
Thank you, Your Majesty, for your grace.

229
00:10:35,030 --> 00:10:35,190
Father,

230
00:10:35,190 --> 00:10:36,270
[Eldest Prince of Fengqi State – Pei Si]

231
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:37,720
I have a proposal.

232
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:38,990
Prince Yi has done great service,

233
00:10:39,020 --> 00:10:40,550
yet remains unmarried.

234
00:10:40,660 --> 00:10:41,720
I believe

235
00:10:41,750 --> 00:10:43,470
we should grant him our cousin from the Bai family

236
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:44,950
in marriage,

237
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:46,730
to bring him joy,

238
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:48,030
and further bind him

239
00:10:48,050 --> 00:10:49,940
to our royal family.

240
00:10:50,810 --> 00:10:53,310
Then let Bai family's legitimate daughter, Bai Xiyao,

241
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,080
be given to Prince Yi in marriage.

242
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,160
Your Majesty.

243
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:01,480
Your Majesty, may I speak.

244
00:11:01,960 --> 00:11:04,030
Bai family's legitimate daughter is gentle and virtuous,

245
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:05,700
but I only know warfare and martial arts,

246
00:11:05,830 --> 00:11:07,530
and fears I would disgrace Eldest Lady Bai.

247
00:11:07,890 --> 00:11:08,880
I

248
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,650
wish to marry Bai family's concubine-born daughter,

249
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:12,100
Bai Xiyue.

250
00:11:12,130 --> 00:11:15,190
Prince Yi, you must have heard the rumors outside,

251
00:11:15,210 --> 00:11:17,340
saying Bai Xiyao lost her chastity after falling into the water,

252
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:19,480
and thus does not favor her, yes?

253
00:11:19,510 --> 00:11:20,830
Brother, watch your words.

254
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,900
Xiyao is our cousin,

255
00:11:23,140 --> 00:11:24,870
her reputation is not to be sullied.

256
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:25,900
The Emperor,

257
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,400
in order to weaken the Empress Dowager's influence,

258
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:29,220
prevent the Bai family from producing an empress,

259
00:11:29,250 --> 00:11:31,380
and humiliate Yun Yichen at the same time.

260
00:11:32,130 --> 00:11:33,800
A concubine-born daughter

261
00:11:34,430 --> 00:11:35,630
is unworthy of

262
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:39,120
our grand Duke of the Fengxi State.

263
00:11:39,160 --> 00:11:40,860
Your marriage to Bai Xiyao

264
00:11:40,890 --> 00:11:42,390
is settled.

265
00:11:42,740 --> 00:11:44,000
Lord Bai,

266
00:11:44,030 --> 00:11:45,700
what say you?

267
00:11:48,760 --> 00:11:50,830
Thank Your Majesty for your great favor.

268
00:11:52,020 --> 00:11:53,520
Your Majesty, please reconsider.

269
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:55,530
The Eldest Prince

270
00:11:55,550 --> 00:11:57,000
shall oversee the wedding,

271
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,920
-Choose an auspicious date for the wedding as soon as possible.
-Yes.

272
00:11:58,950 --> 00:11:59,900
Court dismissed.

273
00:12:05,260 --> 00:12:06,510
Brother Yichen,

274
00:12:06,540 --> 00:12:08,940
though Xiyao's actions are disgraceful,

275
00:12:08,970 --> 00:12:11,170
she is still the Bai family's legitimate daughter, after all,

276
00:12:11,450 --> 00:12:13,050
and I am but a concubine-born girl,

277
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,400
unworthy of you,

278
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:17,500
as is right.

279
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:19,890
No,

280
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:21,710
Xiyue,

281
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,020
in my eyes,

282
00:12:24,590 --> 00:12:26,330
there is no distinction between legitimate and concubine-born.

283
00:12:26,350 --> 00:12:28,570
The one I love is you, as pure as moonlight,

284
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:30,120
as flawless as jade.

285
00:12:30,350 --> 00:12:31,150
Don't worry.

286
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:33,580
I'll find a way to cancel the wedding.

287
00:12:35,290 --> 00:12:36,740
That won't do!

288
00:12:37,250 --> 00:12:39,080
Even though you are a noble Duke,

289
00:12:39,110 --> 00:12:40,880
you still can't defy a royal decree.

290
00:12:40,930 --> 00:12:43,130
I only ask that after the wedding,

291
00:12:43,150 --> 00:12:44,820
you treat Xiyao kindly.

292
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,110
Only when Xiyao summons me

293
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:50,370
can I visit the Duke of Zhen's Mansion to see you.

294
00:12:50,630 --> 00:12:52,350
That way, I won't provoke gossip.

295
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:53,350
Xiyue,

296
00:12:56,310 --> 00:12:57,130
wait for me.

297
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:58,370
I'll go beg the Empress Dowager.

298
00:12:58,390 --> 00:12:59,800
I will find a way to marry you.

299
00:13:02,590 --> 00:13:05,280
There has long been friction between the royal family and the Duke of Zhen's Mansion.

300
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:07,870
Later, the Empress Dowager also gave up on Bai Xiyao.

301
00:13:08,490 --> 00:13:10,430
Father, you heard it all, right?

302
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:14,100
Xiyao will surely marry into the Duke of Zhen's Mansion.

303
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:14,810
As for you,

304
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,990
you must get closer to the Third Prince, Pei Yan.

305
00:13:17,930 --> 00:13:18,790
This is

306
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:20,430
the Empress Dowager's will.

307
00:13:20,450 --> 00:13:21,320
I understand.

308
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:23,680
If Cousin Yan wishes to ascend the throne one day,

309
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:25,530
he will certainly need the support of the Yun's Army.

310
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:26,860
If Xiyao fails to win him over,

311
00:13:26,890 --> 00:13:27,800
then I will take her place

312
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,710
and hold Yun Yichen firmly in my hands.

313
00:13:29,960 --> 00:13:32,130
Worthy of being a daughter of the Bai family.

314
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:33,740
Well done.

315
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,820
First, bow to the heavens and earth.

316
00:13:37,530 --> 00:13:39,140
Yun Yichen is trapped in the capital,

317
00:13:39,140 --> 00:13:40,560
unable to mobilize the Yun's Army,

318
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:42,370
and thus must marry Bai Xiyao.

319
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:45,680
Husband and wife bow to each other.

320
00:13:46,950 --> 00:13:48,130
Very well.

321
00:13:50,370 --> 00:13:52,200
Your Highness, be careful.

322
00:13:58,470 --> 00:13:59,730
What are you doing?

323
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:11,610
Your Highness!

324
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:13,390
-Someone, protect the Duke!
-Your Highness, are you alright?!

325
00:14:13,410 --> 00:14:14,200
There is…

326
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,620
There is poison!

327
00:14:15,650 --> 00:14:17,080
Call the imperial physician, quickly!

328
00:14:17,430 --> 00:14:18,240
Darling!

329
00:14:18,270 --> 00:14:19,240
Your Highness!

330
00:14:19,520 --> 00:14:20,400
Your Highness!

331
00:14:22,400 --> 00:14:24,080
When will the Duke awaken?

332
00:14:24,110 --> 00:14:26,710
There is a deadly poison from Fengrong on the blade.

333
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:28,690
If it cannot be removed in time,

334
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,900
I fear Prince Yi...

335
00:14:29,900 --> 00:14:30,830
Then why are you waiting?

336
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:31,730
Quickly, cure him!

337
00:14:31,730 --> 00:14:33,900
The poison has entered his heart.

338
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:35,600
Even I am powerless.

339
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,670
Unless someone gives him blood from their heart

340
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,400
to save him.

341
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,830
I will. Use mine!

342
00:14:40,930 --> 00:14:41,730
No!

343
00:14:42,250 --> 00:14:44,170
This poison is extremely yang in nature.

344
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,230
It must be balanced with the blood of a woman

345
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:48,150
with extremely yin life force.

346
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:49,910
The women of the Bai family

347
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,550
are naturally of extremely yin fate.

348
00:14:51,580 --> 00:14:54,080
I shall offer my blood in place of my sister to save the Duke.

349
00:14:55,760 --> 00:14:57,510
You two, leave us.

350
00:14:57,670 --> 00:14:58,770
I will draw the blood myself for my sister.

351
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,480
Yes.

352
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:00,270
Yes.

353
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,550
Xiyao,

354
00:15:17,250 --> 00:15:18,740
I'm afraid of pain.

355
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:21,380
I dare not give blood.

356
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,500
If you don't dare, I'll do it.

357
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:26,420
Fool. Of course it has to be you.

358
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,910
I still intend to be the Crown Princess,

359
00:15:27,940 --> 00:15:28,840
and one day the Empress.

360
00:15:28,860 --> 00:15:30,270
How could I risk my own life

361
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:32,600
for him?

362
00:15:36,850 --> 00:15:38,410
If you don't love him,

363
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,890
why do you keep entangling him?

364
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:42,550
I want Yun Yichen's love,

365
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,210
and the position as Pei Yan's

366
00:15:47,550 --> 00:15:49,140
consort.

367
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:52,300
I will take everything from you,

368
00:15:53,450 --> 00:15:57,030
even your every drop of blood.

369
00:15:58,580 --> 00:16:01,040
In my past life, Bai Xiyao saved Yun Yichen,

370
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,390
but I was the one who took her place.

371
00:16:02,580 --> 00:16:03,490
In this life,

372
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:05,530
not only will I not marry Yun Yichen,

373
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:08,040
but Bai Xiyue, you shall gain nothing either.

374
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:13,060
