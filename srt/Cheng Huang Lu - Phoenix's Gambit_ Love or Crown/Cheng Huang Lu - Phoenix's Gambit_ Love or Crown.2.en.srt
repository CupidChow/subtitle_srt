[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:46,350
[Episode 2]

3
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:47,970
My Lady,

4
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,690
let me help you get dressed first.

5
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:54,650
This red dress

6
00:00:54,670 --> 00:00:56,880
was what Bai Xiyao often wore in her past life.

7
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:59,250
Why did you steal my life?

8
00:00:59,270 --> 00:01:01,500
What did I ever do to wrong you?

9
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:03,330
Just because you're my elder Xiyao,

10
00:01:03,350 --> 00:01:04,860
because you're the legitimate daughter of the Bai family,

11
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,130
you were born with everything I ever wanted

12
00:01:07,150 --> 00:01:09,080
under your feet.

13
00:01:09,110 --> 00:01:10,240
I refuse to accept it.

14
00:01:11,789 --> 00:01:13,210
For the Bai family,

15
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:15,330
for my own life,

16
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:19,590
you must die.

17
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,240
I was too foolish,

18
00:01:22,970 --> 00:01:24,920
too weak,

19
00:01:24,950 --> 00:01:27,160
to have tolerated it until now.

20
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,150
If there is another life,

21
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:32,320
I will surely

22
00:01:32,350 --> 00:01:33,800
make you

23
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:36,600
suffer a hundred,

24
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,670
a thousand times more pain than I did.

25
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,570
Xiyao,

26
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:43,720
if there's a next life,

27
00:01:44,350 --> 00:01:46,970
come seek your revenge from me then.

28
00:01:53,630 --> 00:01:54,460
Xiyao,

29
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:55,930
a servant just reported you fell into the water while out.

30
00:01:55,930 --> 00:01:56,720
[Birth father of Bai Xiyao – Bai Wenli]

31
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,130
Are you feeling unwell?

32
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,020
So this is my father, who favored his concubine and discarded his wife,

33
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,800
and who is nothing but a snob.

34
00:02:02,830 --> 00:02:04,920
The Empress Dowager's nephew, Bai Wenli.

35
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:10,259
My head still feels a bit dizzy.

36
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:12,550
I'm unable to rise and greet Father properly.

37
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:14,100
How careless you were,

38
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:14,850
you've made your father terribly worried.

39
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,329
[Birth mother of Bai Xiyue – Madam Mei]

40
00:02:16,550 --> 00:02:18,130
This is Bai Xiyue's birth mother,

41
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:19,090
Madam Mei.

42
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,310
She taught me no small number of tricks in my past life.

43
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:24,450
Truly a familiar face.

44
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:25,650
Mother,

45
00:02:26,020 --> 00:02:28,060
I want to eat your peach blossom soup.

46
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:28,700
You…

47
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:30,600
You called me mother?

48
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:32,640
If I explain everything,

49
00:02:32,660 --> 00:02:34,390
they'll think I've gone mad.

50
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:37,010
For now, I must play the part of Bai Xiyao well,

51
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,320
and not expose any flaws.

52
00:02:38,750 --> 00:02:40,050
Madam Mei, you have always

53
00:02:40,070 --> 00:02:41,690
treated me like your own.

54
00:02:41,710 --> 00:02:42,630
In my heart,

55
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:44,480
I've always seen you as my true mother.

56
00:02:44,530 --> 00:02:47,160
Even if Xiyao is filial and close to your concubine,

57
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,980
you must not forget proper address.

58
00:03:05,070 --> 00:03:06,650
The other Bai Xiyue?

59
00:03:07,090 --> 00:03:08,560
The me from years ago?

60
00:03:09,890 --> 00:03:10,920
I must see for myself...

61
00:03:10,950 --> 00:03:11,460
Father,

62
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:12,240
Is she human or ghost?

63
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:12,620
Mother.

64
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:13,400
Xiyue,

65
00:03:13,420 --> 00:03:15,020
why are you here?

66
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,079
Xiyao.

67
00:03:16,100 --> 00:03:17,510
Xiyao, are you alright?

68
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,650
I was so worried for you.

69
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:20,810
Why are you all standing there?

70
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,300
The lady is still weak.

71
00:03:22,329 --> 00:03:23,800
Tend to her quickly!

72
00:03:23,990 --> 00:03:25,960
Since I am now Bai Xiyao,

73
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,460
then who is this Bai Xiyue?

74
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:30,940
Looks like Xiyao is safe and sound.

75
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,320
Then we must thank

76
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,440
the gentleman who saved her from the water.

77
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:36,720
What did you say?

78
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:39,040
After Xiyao fell into the lake,

79
00:03:39,070 --> 00:03:40,430
she was rescued by a man?

80
00:03:41,030 --> 00:03:42,370
After getting wet,

81
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:44,560
Xiyao had physical contact with a stranger.

82
00:03:44,579 --> 00:03:45,210
You...

83
00:03:45,230 --> 00:03:47,170
You haven't married yet.

84
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,320
Doesn't this

85
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:49,829
ruin your reputation?

86
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:52,360
Is this the scene from my past life,

87
00:03:52,380 --> 00:03:54,579
where I framed Bai Xiyao to lose her reputation

88
00:03:54,610 --> 00:03:56,260
and she fell from favor?

89
00:03:57,210 --> 00:03:59,120
It was I who misspoke.

90
00:03:59,430 --> 00:04:00,830
There was no man.

91
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:03,110
Please, Father, do not punish Xiyao.

92
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:04,940
This has nothing to do with you.

93
00:04:05,450 --> 00:04:06,130
Lianxin,

94
00:04:06,150 --> 00:04:07,740
you're Xiyao's personal maid.

95
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,130
Do you know anything about this?

96
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:12,380
I…

97
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,570
If you dare hide anything,

98
00:04:14,590 --> 00:04:16,040
you'll be expelled from the Bai family

99
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:17,079
and sold off immediately.

100
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,480
T...

101
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:20,010
There was indeed a gentleman.

102
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:23,230
That day, Lady Xiyao said she wanted to walk by Wangxin Lake.

103
00:04:23,270 --> 00:04:24,130
My Lady,

104
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,290
please wipe your sweat.

105
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:28,930
Why did you make the carriage stop so far away?

106
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:30,540
We can't see it now.

107
00:04:33,110 --> 00:04:34,830
Go get some pastries from the carriage.

108
00:04:34,860 --> 00:04:36,460
Come back after one incense stick's time.

109
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:37,710
Yes, My Lady.

110
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:38,590
Then I'll

111
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:39,600
be back soon.

112
00:04:44,730 --> 00:04:45,500
15 minutes later,

113
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,460
when I returned,

114
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:48,440
I saw a man

115
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:51,070
carrying the soaking wet Lady Xiyao to shore.

116
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,860
When I approached,

117
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,150
he had already walked away.

118
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,240
I didn't

119
00:04:59,560 --> 00:05:01,370
see his face clearly.

120
00:05:01,390 --> 00:05:02,260
Lianxin,

121
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:04,370
why didn't you tell me about this earlier?

122
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,420
Lady Xiyao,

123
00:05:05,450 --> 00:05:06,850
you had just woken up.

124
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:08,090
I…

125
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:11,750
I hadn't had the chance to tell you yet.

126
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,090
So the gentleman who saved Xiyao

127
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:16,270
was the one Xiyao was waiting for.

128
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:19,060
I mistook Xiyao's beloved

129
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:20,600
for a stranger,

130
00:05:20,690 --> 00:05:22,580
and almost ruined her reputation.

131
00:05:22,850 --> 00:05:24,720
Let me apologize to Xiyao right away.

132
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,050
Xiyue.

133
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:27,830
Xiyue, stop!

134
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:29,460
You did nothing wrong.

135
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:30,780
She is the one

136
00:05:31,080 --> 00:05:32,300
who was indiscreet.

137
00:05:32,330 --> 00:05:33,130
Father,

138
00:05:33,480 --> 00:05:35,080
it's true I was rescued,

139
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,409
but there is no beloved.

140
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,130
And I was pushed into the lake.

141
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:39,010
Still making excuses?

142
00:05:40,250 --> 00:05:40,710
You...

143
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,100
It was I who misspoke.

144
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,300
There was no man.

145
00:05:43,320 --> 00:05:44,210
Please, Father,

146
00:05:44,230 --> 00:05:45,810
do not punish Xiyao.

147
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,550
Her schemes and tactics are exactly like mine.

148
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,980
So this Bai Xiyue

149
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,760
is who I used to be.

150
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,150
[Name]

151
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:00,910
What is this thing?

152
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:04,200
It's burning hot.

153
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:06,130
Is it trying to burn me alive?

154
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:08,800
This is the Karmic Fire.

155
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:11,870
Immortal Master,

156
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:12,890
Immortal Master, did you realize

157
00:06:12,920 --> 00:06:14,470
you made a mistake with my physical body?

158
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,170
Quick, put me back into Bai Xiyue!

159
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,930
Silence.

160
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:23,190
Immortal Master, please calm your anger.

161
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:24,630
Bai Hong.

162
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:27,070
Bai Xiyao and Bai Xiyue

163
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,680
are your two extremes -- your utmost good and your utmost evil.

164
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:30,960
In your past life,

165
00:06:30,980 --> 00:06:33,260
your evil consumed your good.

166
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:34,350
In this life,

167
00:06:34,380 --> 00:06:36,080
you must restrain your evil

168
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:38,010
and reclaim your good.

169
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:38,940
Immortal Master,

170
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:40,210
what must I do?

171
00:06:40,230 --> 00:06:41,409
In your past life,

172
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:42,960
because of your evil deeds,

173
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:46,290
you left behind seven Karmic Fires of Bai Xiyao.

174
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,770
You must resolve her regrets

175
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,890
to become whole again.

176
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,780
Otherwise,

177
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,409
you will be consumed by the Karmic Fire,

178
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:55,500
body and soul.

179
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:56,700
I still don't understand.

180
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,540
If I help Bai Xiyao,

181
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:00,330
what will happen to Bai Xiyue?

182
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:02,110
Everything you do

183
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:04,530
will reflect onto her.

184
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:05,500
Remember,

185
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,430
right or wrong

186
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:09,580
lies in a single thought.

187
00:07:09,660 --> 00:07:11,360
The first thing I must do in this life

188
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:13,560
is to restore Bai Xiyao's reputation.

189
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:13,960
I...

190
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,150
Speak clearly.

191
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,530
If you dare hide anything,

192
00:07:16,550 --> 00:07:18,270
you'll be expelled from the Bai family immediately.

193
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:20,490
Master...

194
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:21,470
There was indeed someone.

195
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:22,380
Xiyao,

196
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,120
you mustn't admit to this.

197
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:25,230
It was all my fault.

198
00:07:25,230 --> 00:07:26,900
I shouldn't have spoken nonsense…

199
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,090
I just said there was someone.

200
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,980
I meant someone at Wangxin Lake

201
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:32,510
pushed me into the water,

202
00:07:33,210 --> 00:07:34,210
trying to harm me.

203
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,930
Someone tried to take your life?

204
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:37,210
Then what about that strange man?

205
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,620
What strange man?

206
00:07:39,450 --> 00:07:41,500
That's what Madam Mei and Xiyue said.

207
00:07:41,650 --> 00:07:43,170
As if they saw it with their own eyes.

208
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:44,470
Xiyao,

209
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,590
could it be that you're trying to protect your lover,

210
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,420
and made up the story of someone trying to hurt you?

211
00:07:49,730 --> 00:07:52,220
Since Xiyue said there was a strange man,

212
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:54,120
she must have been there at the time.

213
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,880
Did you see who harmed me?

214
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:56,760
I…

215
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,720
I didn't see.

216
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:01,590
I'm frail and can't stand the wind.

217
00:08:01,900 --> 00:08:03,700
I've been copying scriptures in my room,

218
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:05,250
never stepped outside.

219
00:08:05,330 --> 00:08:06,590
Yes,

220
00:08:06,610 --> 00:08:08,400
I've been accompanying her the whole time.

221
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:11,880
[Taozhi, Bai Xiyue's personal maid]

222
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:13,670
At the time, personal maid Taozhi

223
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,530
dressed like me and stayed in the residence.

224
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:16,930
And I…

225
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,610
was the one who pushed Bai Xiyao into the lake.

226
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,430
Xiyao,

227
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:24,330
I'll marry the Crown Prince in your stead.

228
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:28,880
Even someone as immature as I could outwit you.

229
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,650
Who becomes the Empress in the future,

230
00:08:31,670 --> 00:08:32,840
is yet to be determined.

231
00:08:34,710 --> 00:08:36,669
Xiyue, since you didn't see it with her own eyes,

232
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:38,590
how do you know a man saved me?

233
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:40,470
I heard it from the servants in the residence.

234
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:41,470
Which servant?

235
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,520
That day, I only brought Lianxin with me.

236
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,930
Even the coachman

237
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,130
only saw Lianxin carrying me back to the carriage.

238
00:08:50,960 --> 00:08:53,030
It was the maid who heard it from Lianxin.

239
00:08:57,820 --> 00:08:58,950
Lianxin,

240
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,080
did you make this up out of thin air,

241
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:01,200
spreading rumors

242
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:03,140
and falsely accusing your lady?

243
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:05,490
I didn't say anything.

244
00:09:05,890 --> 00:09:06,840
It was me

245
00:09:06,860 --> 00:09:08,910
who brought the unconscious Lady Xiyao back to the residence.

246
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,130
There was no strange man.

247
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:10,790
You…

248
00:09:10,810 --> 00:09:11,850
You're lying!

249
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:12,810
You were in the kitchen…

250
00:09:12,830 --> 00:09:14,300
So it was you, spouting nonsense,

251
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,200
stirring up trouble.

252
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:16,660
What good does it do you

253
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:17,830
to tarnish the Bai family's reputation?

254
00:09:17,850 --> 00:09:19,100
What are your motives?

255
00:09:20,190 --> 00:09:21,260
I dare not…

256
00:09:21,930 --> 00:09:22,840
Servants!

257
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:25,080
Flog this wicked maid fifty times

258
00:09:25,100 --> 00:09:26,200
and expel her from the Bai family.

259
00:09:26,710 --> 00:09:28,170
Master, mercy! Master!

260
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:29,420
Master, have mercy!

261
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:30,850
Master, have mercy!

262
00:09:30,900 --> 00:09:32,580
I truly didn't lie, Master!

263
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:33,400
My Lady!

264
00:09:33,530 --> 00:09:34,180
Lady Xiyue!

265
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,560
Lady Xiyue, save me!

266
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,380
Save me, Lady Xiyue!

267
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:38,870
Save me, Lady Xiyue!

268
00:09:38,890 --> 00:09:40,230
Lady Xiyue!

269
00:09:40,250 --> 00:09:42,050
-Lady Xiyue, save me.
- Father!

270
00:09:43,670 --> 00:09:44,600
Xiyue!

271
00:09:44,620 --> 00:09:45,820
My Xiyue!

272
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,180
Enough.

273
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:48,450
What happened today

274
00:09:48,470 --> 00:09:49,340
ends here.

275
00:09:49,990 --> 00:09:50,690
Father,

276
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:53,120
I was pushed into the lake by someone.

277
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:55,000
I beg you to seek justice for me.

278
00:09:55,030 --> 00:09:56,190
I failed to manage her subordinates,

279
00:09:56,220 --> 00:09:57,450
and such a wicked servant emerged.

280
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,230
Please punish me, Father.

281
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:00,290
Xiyue.

282
00:10:01,730 --> 00:10:02,730
Xiyue.

283
00:10:03,180 --> 00:10:04,630
Xiyue.

284
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:08,350
This is a tactic I never used in my past life.

285
00:10:08,380 --> 00:10:09,810
-Feigning unconsciousness to escape punishment.
-Quick.

286
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:10,970
Quickly summon the physician!

287
00:10:11,450 --> 00:10:12,320
Xiyue!

288
00:10:12,450 --> 00:10:13,350
Xiyue!

289
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,600
What you said,

290
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,280
Father will have someone investigate.

291
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:19,000
Just rest well for now.

292
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:19,680
Yes.

293
00:10:19,710 --> 00:10:22,060
In the past life, only Bai Xiyao was punished.

294
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:22,970
And in the end,

295
00:10:22,990 --> 00:10:24,920
it was all swept under the rug.

296
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:32,640
I…

297
00:10:32,660 --> 00:10:34,010
I'm innocent.

298
00:10:34,060 --> 00:10:35,690
I did not have an affair with a strange man.

299
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:37,100
I'm innocent!

300
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:38,250
Still arguing?

301
00:10:38,270 --> 00:10:40,230
Seems like the filth hasn't been washed clean.

302
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:40,960
Continue!

303
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:04,340
It'd be better if she just died,

304
00:11:04,370 --> 00:11:07,050
like your short-lived mother.

305
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:09,940
If someone truly claims they saved you from the lake,

306
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,140
then prove your innocence with your death.

307
00:11:12,270 --> 00:11:13,670
The Bai family will

308
00:11:13,690 --> 00:11:15,010
treat it as if you never existed.

309
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:18,020
If anyone dares to speak nonsense,

310
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,240
then I shall make them

311
00:11:20,890 --> 00:11:24,230
rest eternally at the bottom of Wangxin Lake.

312
00:11:32,590 --> 00:11:33,580
Done.

313
00:11:34,020 --> 00:11:35,260
So it was that simple.

314
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:36,780
With the memories of my past life,

315
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:38,170
everything truly goes my way.

316
00:11:39,950 --> 00:11:41,240
Greetings, Lady Xiyao.

317
00:11:42,450 --> 00:11:43,690
I remember now.

318
00:11:43,750 --> 00:11:45,810
This is the 24th year of Yousheng.

319
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,080
The old Emperor still reigns.

320
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,530
Pei Yan hasn't ascended the throne yet.

321
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:49,720
Lianxin,

322
00:11:49,740 --> 00:11:51,320
what season is it now?

323
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:52,890
My Lady,

324
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:55,210
it's just over a month until the Double Ninth Festival.

325
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:57,890
After experiencing life and death,

326
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,050
it feels like another world.

327
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:01,210
My mind is a mess,

328
00:12:01,270 --> 00:12:02,530
I can't remember anything.

329
00:12:02,530 --> 00:12:03,580
I need to learn more

330
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
about matters related to Bai Xiyao.

331
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:07,840
How about asking the Master to request the Empress Dowager

332
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:10,100
to summon an imperial physician for you?

333
00:12:11,370 --> 00:12:12,530
That won't be necessary.

334
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,780
Just help me recall more details.

335
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,720
A few days ago, someone sent a sachet.

336
00:12:17,750 --> 00:12:20,350
After that, you said you wanted to go admire the Wangxin Lake.

337
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:21,300
The sachet?

338
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,440
Where is it now?

339
00:12:22,460 --> 00:12:23,360
After you fell into the water,

340
00:12:23,390 --> 00:12:24,380
I aired it out in the backyard

341
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:26,060
with your change of clothes.

342
00:12:27,350 --> 00:12:28,600
My Lady, slow down.

343
00:12:28,620 --> 00:12:29,520
I'll get an umbrella.

344
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:32,120
The sachet…

345
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:34,090
An old sachet.

346
00:12:37,710 --> 00:12:39,280
My Lady, over there.

347
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:51,440
This Loong and Cloud Pattern

348
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,340
looks quite familiar.

349
00:12:53,670 --> 00:12:55,130
Isn't this the sachet Bai Xiyao

350
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,850
gave to Yun Yichen?

351
00:12:57,150 --> 00:12:59,180
Could it be that Bai Xiyao went to Wangxin Lake

352
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,680
to meet Yun Yichen?

353
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,200
Lianxin,

354
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,420
I'm a bit hungry.

355
00:13:08,450 --> 00:13:09,820
Go prepare something to eat,

356
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,630
snowflake crisps, peach blossom soup or something.

357
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:12,550
I'll wait in my room.

358
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,700
Yes, My Lady.

359
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,180
So imposing…

360
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,100
Which general is in that carriage?

361
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:26,320
Don't speak nonsense.

362
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,200
That's His Highness Prince Yi.

363
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:30,430
The only hereditary prince of a different surname in our dynasty.

364
00:13:30,450 --> 00:13:32,540
The one who commands 300,000 border troops,

365
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:33,870
Prince Yi, Yun Yichen.

366
00:13:34,930 --> 00:13:36,410
Where are we now?

367
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:38,330
We've passed Yanxia Pavilion and the Minister's Mansion,

368
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,880
almost at the Duke's Mansion.

369
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:41,340
Ten years…

370
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,070
I can finally use your blood to honor my parents' memory.

371
00:13:48,290 --> 00:13:49,730
Why can I hear coughing

372
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:51,000
from so far away?

373
00:13:51,250 --> 00:13:52,880
His Highness Prince Yi has been at war for years.

374
00:13:52,910 --> 00:13:54,290
New wounds over old ones,

375
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:55,950
his health must be failing.

376
00:13:56,780 --> 00:13:59,220
-Truly, heroes never live long.
-I was right.

377
00:13:59,570 --> 00:14:01,740
Yun Yichen returned triumphant today.

378
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,460
Then who was it

379
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:06,000
that sent the identical sachet before?

380
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:09,320
Enough, kneel quickly!

381
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:09,820
Come on.

382
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,820
Kneel quickly!

383
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:26,590
It's her.

384
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:32,450
He's back.

385
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,440
He's back!

386
00:14:35,210 --> 00:14:36,440
He's back!

387
00:14:36,730 --> 00:14:38,800
He will definitely come to the Bai family to bring up that matter.

388
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:43,840
Right,

389
00:14:44,890 --> 00:14:46,660
I'm not just Bai Xiyao,

390
00:14:47,380 --> 00:14:49,220
I'm also Bai Hong.

391
00:14:49,660 --> 00:14:51,320
All the memories of magical powers

392
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,910
are still with me.

393
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,030
I must quickly look back into the River of Time

394
00:14:56,030 --> 00:14:57,350
to see why Yun Yichen, the border guardian,

395
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,400
could return to the capital.

396
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:00,860
Reverse

397
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:01,450
Time

398
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:02,110
Cavern

399
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:02,980
Sight

400
00:15:03,370 --> 00:15:04,250
Open!

401
00:15:05,790 --> 00:15:06,850
Yun Yichen's grandfather

402
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,300
was the founding general of the nation,

403
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:10,120
holding the hereditary title of Duke of Zhen.

404
00:15:15,870 --> 00:15:16,740
My Lord,

405
00:15:16,770 --> 00:15:17,740
reinforcements have yet to arrive.

406
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:18,630
The Yun's Army

407
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,870
will fight to the death and not retreat,

408
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:20,900
not yielding a single inch of land.

409
00:15:20,940 --> 00:15:23,060
With courage and strategy,

410
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:24,400
Yun Yichen guarded the borderlands,

411
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,900
subjugated the Fengrong State,

412
00:15:26,150 --> 00:15:28,500
and successfully consolidated power over the Yun's Army.

413
00:15:29,630 --> 00:15:31,630
Prince Yi! Prince Yi! Prince Yi!

414
00:15:31,660 --> 00:15:34,870
Prince Yi! Prince Yi! Prince Yi!

415
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:37,050
Prince Yi! Prince Yi! Prince Yi!

416
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:39,760
Prince Yi! Prince Yi! Prince Yi!

417
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,060
In my past life,

418
00:15:42,090 --> 00:15:44,270
he was set on avenging the death of his parents,

419
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,480
but I drugged him and clouded his mind,

420
00:15:46,840 --> 00:15:48,550
making him into a violent madman.

421
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,230
Tao Yu,

422
00:15:49,250 --> 00:15:50,990
who allowed you to mention them to me?

423
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:52,050
Get out!

424
00:15:53,420 --> 00:15:54,580
I want to drink.

425
00:16:00,830 --> 00:16:01,990
What's happening?

426
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,550
My head… so dizzy…
