[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,330
[Episode 13]

3
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,120
Don't worry.

4
00:00:56,940 --> 00:00:59,400
Once I help you annul your engagement with Pei Yan,

5
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,600
I'll marry you in a grand procession.

6
00:01:03,460 --> 00:01:04,930
What about sister?

7
00:01:05,260 --> 00:01:07,090
Isn't she still useful to you?

8
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:08,350
When the time is right,

9
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:10,000
I'll divorce her immediately.

10
00:01:10,550 --> 00:01:13,390
You are my only Duchess.

11
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,120
If you divorce my sister,

12
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:22,500
she'll be too ashamed to return to the Bai family.

13
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,110
It's better for her to stay in the Duke's Mansion

14
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:27,250
as a concubine.

15
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:28,560
Then let her

16
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:30,720
keep watch at the door every day.

17
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:34,070
She's only fit to be your maid.

18
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:37,210
It's my first time.

19
00:01:37,910 --> 00:01:39,600
The candlelight is too bright.

20
00:01:40,100 --> 00:01:41,210
I'm shy.

21
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:12,480
Do you want me to listen outside while you fornicate?

22
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:14,150
Have you no shame?

23
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:15,600
Xiyao, you misunderstood me.

24
00:02:15,630 --> 00:02:17,760
It's Yichen who's deeply devoted to me.

25
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:20,040
But I will never marry him.

26
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:23,050
Now is a good chance for you two to reconcile.

27
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:25,579
While Yichen is drunk,

28
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:26,950
Xiyao, go in quickly.

29
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,829
What scheme are you plotting to harm me this time?

30
00:02:30,910 --> 00:02:31,880
Xiyao,

31
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,860
I must marry the future Crown Prince with my honor intact.

32
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,890
You and Yichen have been married for so long

33
00:02:36,910 --> 00:02:38,450
but always live in separate rooms.

34
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:40,630
If you had a child,

35
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:43,090
wouldn't Yichen treat you better?

36
00:02:44,150 --> 00:02:45,350
That's my business.

37
00:02:45,630 --> 00:02:46,670
Don't meddle.

38
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:49,360
Don't think I'll be your substitute.

39
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,540
Xiyao,

40
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:53,050
you're supposed to stay in the Duke's Mansion forever.

41
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:55,910
Even the servants dare to give you attitude.

42
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:57,730
Isn't it because you're not favored?

43
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,580
Serving your husband well is a woman's virtue.

44
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:03,430
Don't ruin your future.

45
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,360
I love you.

46
00:04:01,730 --> 00:04:03,780
I will treat you well for life.

47
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:25,350
My period hasn't come for three months.

48
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,220
Lianxin,

49
00:04:34,510 --> 00:04:37,130
later when the manor is less busy,

50
00:04:37,150 --> 00:04:38,680
accompany me to see the doctor.

51
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:41,030
Madam, are you feeling unwell?

52
00:04:41,909 --> 00:04:43,420
Don't ask.

53
00:04:44,230 --> 00:04:45,110
Lately, you've

54
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:46,720
been craving these sour preserved fruits.

55
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:48,530
Could it be…

56
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,050
Don't say a word.

57
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:53,760
If the duke dislikes it,

58
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,430
it'll only cause trouble.

59
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,560
Yes.

60
00:05:08,980 --> 00:05:10,210
Little Bai,

61
00:05:10,230 --> 00:05:11,460
where are you?

62
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:15,060
I got you!

63
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:15,930
Little Bai,

64
00:05:16,140 --> 00:05:17,600
you're still the same as before.

65
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,990
You always dodge to the left.

66
00:05:45,060 --> 00:05:46,110
Darling.

67
00:05:53,090 --> 00:05:54,520
Why is it you?

68
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:56,560
I…

69
00:05:56,590 --> 00:05:58,680
Was just about to go buy some things.

70
00:06:03,620 --> 00:06:04,510
It's winter now.

71
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:06,210
Add more clothes,

72
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,740
lest outsiders think

73
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:10,730
our Duke's Mansion mistreats you.

74
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,090
Thank you for your concern, Darling.

75
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,540
Yichen.

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,510
Lianxin.

77
00:06:39,390 --> 00:06:40,409
Bai Xiyao.

78
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:43,360
If the maid hadn't reported you're pregnant,

79
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:45,240
how long were you planning to hide it from me?

80
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:46,010
Tell me.

81
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,050
Whose child is it?

82
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,810
Shouldn't you already know?

83
00:06:50,770 --> 00:06:52,159
Why not ask her?

84
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:56,860
Yichen…

85
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:58,840
That Lantern Festival night…

86
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:02,580
Bai Xiyao,

87
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,800
how dare you!

88
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:06,490
Do you not know shame?

89
00:07:06,510 --> 00:07:08,600
How dare you climb into my bed!

90
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,410
I shared a bed with my own husband,

91
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:14,260
what is there to be ashamed of?

92
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:16,010
What about her then?

93
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:19,460
Yichen,

94
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:21,240
please don't blame Xiyao.

95
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:23,320
I was the shameless one.

96
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,190
I shouldn't keep having improper thoughts.

97
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:27,860
It's just because I love Yichen so much

98
00:07:27,890 --> 00:07:29,620
that I lost my judgment.

99
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,409
Xiyue.

100
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:38,040
Bai Xiyao,

101
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:39,700
do you really think

102
00:07:39,850 --> 00:07:40,550
just by sleeping with me

103
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:42,550
you can replace Xiyue's place in my heart?

104
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:43,510
Ridiculous.

105
00:07:45,100 --> 00:07:45,880
Guards,

106
00:07:46,290 --> 00:07:47,670
give her the abortion medicine.

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:49,170
Give it to her.

108
00:07:54,380 --> 00:07:55,550
I'll take the medicine.

109
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:57,480
But let's divorce immediately.

110
00:08:00,950 --> 00:08:01,980
Divorce?

111
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:06,830
Marrying you already made me a laughingstock.

112
00:08:07,510 --> 00:08:10,990
Now you want to make the entire Duke's Mansion lose face?

113
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:14,520
It's not that simple, is it?

114
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:17,580
You're just putting on a weak front for others,

115
00:08:18,460 --> 00:08:20,790
needing me, a cast-off from the Bai family,

116
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:21,930
to help you maintain

117
00:08:21,930 --> 00:08:24,430
an image of someone who obeys imperial decree.

118
00:08:26,380 --> 00:08:27,360
Give it to me.

119
00:08:31,950 --> 00:08:33,010
Xiyao,

120
00:08:33,059 --> 00:08:35,059
look how angry you've made Yichen.

121
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:37,720
Just drink it like he said.

122
00:08:37,750 --> 00:08:38,929
You'll have other children

123
00:08:38,950 --> 00:08:40,929
in the future.

124
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,260
From today onward,

125
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,250
whatever you want to do, do it.

126
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:04,390
I won't ask.

127
00:09:05,250 --> 00:09:07,860
Just don't disgust me again with Bai Xiyue.

128
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:10,680
Whether you want to divorce or kill me,

129
00:09:10,700 --> 00:09:12,070
do as you wish.

130
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:13,510
Bai Xiyao.

131
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:48,950
In this lifetime,

132
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:51,580
I will make it up to you.

133
00:09:53,260 --> 00:09:54,690
Is your sister feeling better?

134
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,170
My Lord,

135
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:57,470
she's recovered.

136
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,520
What are her plans?

137
00:10:01,280 --> 00:10:04,010
Lianxin still wants to return to Miss Bai's side to serve her,

138
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:05,770
to atone for her past mistakes.

139
00:10:07,950 --> 00:10:08,980
You can't bear to part with her, can you?

140
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:10,260
Yes.

141
00:10:10,420 --> 00:10:12,140
I want to keep my sister by my side to care for her.

142
00:10:13,250 --> 00:10:15,080
I don't want her to be a servant again.

143
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,190
I have an idea.

144
00:10:17,650 --> 00:10:19,030
It will grant her wish

145
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:20,650
and allow you

146
00:10:20,670 --> 00:10:22,600
to stay by her side.

147
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:24,800
My Lord,

148
00:10:25,260 --> 00:10:26,810
are you going to send me

149
00:10:26,840 --> 00:10:28,540
to Miss Bai?

150
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,390
Fool.

151
00:10:30,620 --> 00:10:34,080
I'm asking to marry Bai Xiyao.

152
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,330
[Yanxia Pavilion]

153
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,680
My Lady, you're here.

154
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:47,500
Lately, go find the best rouge and powder.

155
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:48,460
Spare no expense.

156
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,450
Send all the finest goods to my manor.

157
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:51,270
Understood.

158
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:52,670
My Lady.

159
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:11,180
Lianxin, where have you been lately?

160
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,300
I asked my sister,

161
00:11:12,330 --> 00:11:13,990
but she wouldn't say a word.

162
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,700
I have been sick and resting,

163
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:16,860
just recovered.

164
00:11:18,930 --> 00:11:20,160
As long as you're fine now.

165
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,380
Put it down.

166
00:11:23,400 --> 00:11:23,930
Yes.

167
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:30,280
What exactly happened?

168
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,270
Why wasn't Bai Xiyao killed?

169
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:33,920
My Lady,

170
00:11:34,130 --> 00:11:35,640
I finally found

171
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,850
a secluded place,

172
00:11:36,870 --> 00:11:38,340
just as I was about to act,

173
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:40,160
an old man appeared out of nowhere.

174
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:41,350
He thought I had the dagger

175
00:11:41,370 --> 00:11:42,920
to protect Bai Xiyao.

176
00:11:43,140 --> 00:11:44,700
Without asking,

177
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:46,260
he gravely wounded me.

178
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:48,060
Even with that misunderstanding,

179
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:50,500
why did the skilled assassin

180
00:11:50,530 --> 00:11:52,360
fail to kill Bai Xiyao

181
00:11:52,390 --> 00:11:53,620
and end up dead himself?

182
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:54,980
When the assassin wounded me,

183
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:56,230
Bai Xiyao took the chance to run

184
00:11:56,250 --> 00:11:57,500
and sought help from the charity hall.

185
00:11:57,810 --> 00:11:58,860
When I woke up,

186
00:11:59,250 --> 00:12:02,100
I learned I had been rescued by Master Yuan of charity hall.

187
00:12:02,970 --> 00:12:04,370
You're saying

188
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:08,410
Bai Xiyao was saved by that hall master?

189
00:12:09,950 --> 00:12:10,870
While recovering these days,

190
00:12:10,890 --> 00:12:11,910
I heard

191
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,400
the charity hall on the outskirts of the capital

192
00:12:13,430 --> 00:12:15,960
is often targeted by bandits and thieves.

193
00:12:16,060 --> 00:12:18,890
Even among the refugees, there are rogues trying to snatch food.

194
00:12:19,060 --> 00:12:21,460
But that Hall Master Yuan is skilled in martial arts,

195
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:24,010
and several of his men are strong fighters,

196
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,530
which is why the charity hall has stayed safe.

197
00:12:28,020 --> 00:12:29,670
So that's the case.

198
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:31,280
The Luozhi Hall members

199
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,120
were actually killed by people from the charity hall.

200
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:36,820
Bai Xiyao's luck is just too good.

201
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:38,950
My Lady,

202
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:40,950
As soon as I recovered,

203
00:12:40,980 --> 00:12:42,420
I came here to wait for you,

204
00:12:42,450 --> 00:12:44,280
just to report the reason to you.

205
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:47,360
Loyal of you.

206
00:12:47,390 --> 00:12:48,690
Since you haven't been exposed,

207
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:51,350
continue staying by Bai Xiyao's side and keep watch.

208
00:12:51,380 --> 00:12:52,810
Your efforts will be rewarded.

209
00:12:54,980 --> 00:12:55,710
Yes.

210
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:57,570
Thank you, My Lady.

211
00:13:00,220 --> 00:13:02,050
She's having you continue spying on me?

212
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:02,860
Yes.

213
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:05,460
Seems she believed the reason I gave.

214
00:13:07,060 --> 00:13:07,890
But,

215
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,330
I don't think so.

216
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:11,130
She probably only believed part of it.

217
00:13:11,670 --> 00:13:13,870
Bai Xiyue never trusts anyone.

218
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,280
She might have even guessed

219
00:13:16,300 --> 00:13:17,720
that you approached her first

220
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:19,370
just to dispel her suspicion.

221
00:13:21,380 --> 00:13:22,110
I...

222
00:13:22,140 --> 00:13:23,830
I think she's really scary.

223
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:27,010
Actually, it's quite pitiful.

224
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:28,750
In my previous life,

225
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:31,320
I lived just like that, extremely selfish,

226
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:33,580
never opening my heart.

227
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:34,910
My Lady,

228
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,170
to be honest,

229
00:13:38,340 --> 00:13:40,290
I don't hate her that much.

230
00:13:41,310 --> 00:13:42,700
You don't want revenge?

231
00:13:42,730 --> 00:13:44,480
But my brother didn't die.

232
00:13:44,510 --> 00:13:46,720
He actually gained a blessing in disguise and ended up with His Lordship.

233
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,710
Now that we're reunited,

234
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:51,650
I just want to live a good life.

235
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:53,650
I never thought about revenge.

236
00:13:54,770 --> 00:13:55,860
Honestly,

237
00:13:56,810 --> 00:13:59,160
I used to admire Lady Xiyue.

238
00:14:02,330 --> 00:14:03,270
Lianxin,

239
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,310
it's exactly because of your kindness

240
00:14:06,530 --> 00:14:08,690
that I've been able to survive again and again.

241
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,030
You

242
00:14:14,060 --> 00:14:15,720
just report things truthfully.

243
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,580
Don't hide anything about me.

244
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:18,980
Otherwise, she'll grow suspicious.

245
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:19,750
That way,

246
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:21,920
we can keep track of her true intentions.

247
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:28,680
Lianxin,

248
00:14:28,740 --> 00:14:31,780
if you're about to say anything like “make amends”

249
00:14:31,810 --> 00:14:33,120
or “atone for my sins,”

250
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,910
then I suggest you save it.

251
00:14:35,630 --> 00:14:36,600
My Lady,

252
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,530
you don't blame me?

253
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:40,520
Those who don't know are not guilty.

254
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:41,850
Besides,

255
00:14:41,880 --> 00:14:43,410
we're good friends.

256
00:14:45,340 --> 00:14:46,350
Friends?

257
00:14:46,370 --> 00:14:47,680
My Lady,

258
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:49,950
you consider me your good friend?

259
00:14:50,270 --> 00:14:52,710
Though we can't choose our identities,

260
00:14:53,140 --> 00:14:54,570
I can choose

261
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:57,090
to let you be my best friend since childhood.

262
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:58,470
My Lady!

263
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,600
The border has been secured.

264
00:15:05,710 --> 00:15:08,970
Prince Yi, you can stay in the capital to recover.

265
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:10,980
Thank you for Your Majesty's grace.

266
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:12,640
Father,

267
00:15:13,290 --> 00:15:14,430
I have a petition.

268
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:16,150
Prince Yi has done great deeds,

269
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:17,660
but he is not yet married.

270
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:18,970
What do you think...

271
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,010
Someone come,

272
00:15:20,300 --> 00:15:21,200
quick, bring a seat.

273
00:15:21,590 --> 00:15:22,220
No need.

274
00:15:29,050 --> 00:15:30,700
Thank… thank Your Majesty.

275
00:15:31,800 --> 00:15:33,220
My body

276
00:15:33,830 --> 00:15:35,180
is beyond cure,

277
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,490
deteriorating by the day.

278
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,260
So I wish to ask Your Majesty

279
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:41,380
to bestow a marriage

280
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:43,630
to continue the lineage of the Duke's Mansion.

281
00:15:44,060 --> 00:15:44,850
Oh?

282
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:47,940
Do you have someone in mind?

283
00:15:48,010 --> 00:15:49,510
Whose daughter is she?

284
00:15:49,530 --> 00:15:50,750
Your Majesty,

285
00:15:52,180 --> 00:15:53,020
I

286
00:15:53,550 --> 00:15:56,910
wishe to marry Bai family's second daughter, Bai Xiyue.

287
00:15:57,970 --> 00:15:58,610
Father,

288
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:00,040
Bai Xiyue is a concubine-born daughter.

289
00:16:00,060 --> 00:16:02,070
How can she be worthy of marrying the Duke of the Fengqi State?

290
00:16:02,190 --> 00:16:03,520
In my opinion,

291
00:16:04,450 --> 00:16:06,910
Bai family's legitimate daughter Bai Xiyao

292
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:08,900
is more suitable for Prince Yi.

293
00:16:09,110 --> 00:16:10,060
Father,

294
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:11,990
Elder Brother is mistaken.

295
00:16:12,030 --> 00:16:13,730
Since Prince Yi truly favors Bai Xiyue,

296
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:15,680
why would he care about status?

297
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:16,660
Besides,

298
00:16:16,680 --> 00:16:18,250
Xiyao has always been close to me.

299
00:16:18,360 --> 00:16:19,700
As far as I know,

300
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:21,200
she has no particular affection for Prince Yi.

301
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:22,380
Why force it?
