00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,260
[Episode 17]

3
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,900
You're feeling lost right now, aren't you?

4
00:00:49,430 --> 00:00:50,500
I'm not.

5
00:00:50,970 --> 00:00:54,800
As long as I can help Bai Xiyue become empress smoothly, that's all that matters.

6
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:56,470
What does this have to do with Yun Yichen?

7
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:58,520
Bai Xiyue is already out of control.

8
00:00:58,850 --> 00:01:01,830
Your suppression at every turn has only made her evolve stronger.

9
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:03,610
Starting as a princess and slowly working her way up

10
00:01:03,610 --> 00:01:05,770
no longer satisfies her ambition.

11
00:01:05,980 --> 00:01:07,800
She wants to start as a consort

12
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:09,150
to reach the top faster.

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:11,490
That's not bad.

14
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:13,200
When the snipe and the clam fight,

15
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,300
the fisherman benefits.

16
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:15,830
It saves me a lot of trouble.

17
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:17,420
Don't forget,

18
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,900
she has the Love-Slave Elixir.

19
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:22,630
She will sacrifice everyone she can use

20
00:01:22,930 --> 00:01:25,539
to achieve her goals.

21
00:01:26,260 --> 00:01:28,180
Isn't that how you were back then?

22
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,930
It won't happen.

23
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:31,830
The course of this life has already changed.

24
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,030
I will stop her.

25
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:36,720
If I told you that...

26
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,270
the price for Bai Xiyue to become empress

27
00:01:40,289 --> 00:01:42,090
is your life,

28
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,420
would you be willing to make that exchange?

29
00:01:44,420 --> 00:01:45,990
Why should I die?

30
00:01:46,190 --> 00:01:47,850
I am Bai Xiyao now.

31
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,039
If I die,

32
00:01:49,060 --> 00:01:51,620
wouldn't I just end up failing my tribulation again?

33
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:53,100
I'm talking about you,

34
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,610
Bai Hong.

35
00:01:56,740 --> 00:01:58,340
Bai Xiyao would live on

36
00:01:58,370 --> 00:02:01,030
and get the happiness that should've been hers.

37
00:02:01,450 --> 00:02:04,450
Bai Xiyue would get the power she's always dreamed of.

38
00:02:05,420 --> 00:02:06,750
I die?

39
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,380
You mean...

40
00:02:09,410 --> 00:02:13,090
Bai Hong from the River of Time would be completely destroyed, body and soul?

41
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,140
That's right.

42
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:17,360
Bai Xiyao and Bai Xiyue would each fulfill their destinies,

43
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:19,000
finally merging into one

44
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:20,829
and becoming the new Bai Hong.

45
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:23,090
Shut up. Stop talking!

46
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:33,150
Then you can try

47
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:34,510
to kill me.

48
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:40,960
Go ahead and do it.

49
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:46,560
Stop!

50
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:06,070
My family has been unwaveringly loyal to Your Highness and Prince Si!

51
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,670
Please give me another chance, Your Highness!

52
00:03:10,700 --> 00:03:11,500
Is that so?

53
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,910
You were the one who pledged your allegiance to me at that time,

54
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:17,070
willing to ruin your eldest daughter's reputation

55
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,730
to sabotage her engagement to the Third Prince.

56
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:22,220
I

57
00:03:22,240 --> 00:03:25,000
am willing to offer my humble services to Your Highness and the Eldest Prince.

58
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,190
I only ask that when the Eldest Prince ascends to the throne,

59
00:03:27,190 --> 00:03:31,030
he can forgive my family for the past offenses committed
under the Empress Dowager's command.

60
00:03:31,030 --> 00:03:33,560
You certainly know how to read the situation.

61
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:36,450
But once your daughter Bai Xiyao marries Pei Yan,

62
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,940
those old ministers loyal to the Empress Dowager

63
00:03:40,110 --> 00:03:42,500
will fully support the Third Prince.

64
00:03:43,870 --> 00:03:45,430
How do you expect me

65
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:46,900
to trust you?

66
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:47,750
I

67
00:03:47,770 --> 00:03:50,890
will definitely not let my daughter marry the Third Prince.

68
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:52,750
And you think merely saying so makes it real?

69
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:54,190
You dare to defy...

70
00:03:54,410 --> 00:03:55,630
your aunt?

71
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,810
It's not that she won't marry;

72
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:58,100
it's that she won't be worthy of marrying him.

73
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:59,940
As long as my daughter's reputation is damaged,

74
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:03,470
the Empress Dowager will certainly not agree to this marriage.

75
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:06,390
You surely have a cruel heart.

76
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:09,980
You're willing to destroy your own daughter with your own hands?

77
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:12,750
Bai Xiyao was raised by the Empress Dowager since she was little.

78
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,090
There was never much of a father-daughter bond between us.

79
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:17,050
The daughter born of my concubine

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:19,019
is truly the apple of my eye.

81
00:04:19,100 --> 00:04:20,640
Since that's the case,

82
00:04:21,079 --> 00:04:22,880
let's proceed as you suggested.

83
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,410
After this is done,

84
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:27,680
I'll have my son become better acquainted with you.

85
00:04:27,710 --> 00:04:28,770
Yes, Your Highness.

86
00:04:28,770 --> 00:04:29,900
Right now,

87
00:04:29,920 --> 00:04:32,520
His Majesty wants to appoint me as the Empress.

88
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:35,690
But the Empress Dowager has always been obstructing this.

89
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,950
Your second daughter becoming a consort

90
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,330
must also be part of her scheme.

91
00:04:40,580 --> 00:04:41,670
After all,

92
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,960
Bai Xiyao is no longer useful to her.

93
00:04:45,260 --> 00:04:46,430
So, Lord Bai.

94
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:50,510
What do you think I should do now?

95
00:04:51,500 --> 00:04:53,070
Xiyue is a good child,

96
00:04:53,260 --> 00:04:54,950
always thinking about our family.

97
00:04:54,950 --> 00:04:57,430
Her accidentally becoming a consort this time...

98
00:04:57,430 --> 00:05:00,830
might be a good opportunity to deal with the Empress Dowager.

99
00:05:01,330 --> 00:05:03,680
The Empress Dowager doesn't think much of Bai Xiyue at all.

100
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:05,540
She won't even spare her a glance.

101
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:07,000
What's the use of her?

102
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:09,320
Since Xiyue is about to enter the palace and become a consort,

103
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:10,850
it's only right for her sister to accompany

104
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:12,070
and take care of her there.

105
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:13,270
The Empress Dowager and Pei Yan

106
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:15,390
will think there's still a chance for the engagement.

107
00:05:15,390 --> 00:05:17,610
It can drive a wedge between the Third Prince and Prince Yi.

108
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:19,260
As long as the Empress Dowager agrees to meet with Xiyue,

109
00:05:19,260 --> 00:05:22,170
my daughter will have a way to make her bedridden.

110
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:25,150
Poison her?

111
00:05:25,170 --> 00:05:26,400
I wouldn't dare.

112
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:27,620
It's just

113
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:31,250
that there are some old remedies passed down through our family.

114
00:05:32,810 --> 00:05:34,470
They all say your ancestor...

115
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:38,760
once served as a military physician during the founding emperor's
campaigns to expand the empire.

116
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,820
Your family legacy indeed runs deep.

117
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:43,470
I've heard that your family has a miraculous drug

118
00:05:43,470 --> 00:05:45,200
called the Love-Slave Elixir.

119
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:49,110
It can make people deeply infatuated.

120
00:05:50,250 --> 00:05:51,860
I wonder if that's true.

121
00:05:52,659 --> 00:05:54,320
That's completely baseless.

122
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,020
If such a drug really existed,

123
00:05:56,020 --> 00:05:57,270
forget about just the position of empress—

124
00:05:57,270 --> 00:05:59,970
wouldn't the entire court of the Great Yuan be under our control?

125
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:02,960
It's all slander from the concubines who failed to compete
with the Empress Dowager

126
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:05,220
for the late Emperor's favor in the past.

127
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,560
Lord Bai.

128
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,230
If you can help pave the way

129
00:06:10,250 --> 00:06:11,420
for my son to become Crown Prince

130
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,940
and clear all of the obstacles,

131
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,600
when he reaches the top,

132
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:17,560
you'll certainly be appointed as prime minister...

133
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,390
the highest position a subject can attain.

134
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,020
I can also adopt

135
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:28,890
and raise Xiyue's child.

136
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:34,440
I'll grant him the status of the Empress's child.

137
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
Thank you for your kindness, Your Highness.

138
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:44,790
Miss Bai, must you go to such extremes?

139
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,720
Why are you trying to end your life?

140
00:06:49,090 --> 00:06:50,070
I'm not.

141
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:52,420
I just drank a little too much

142
00:06:52,540 --> 00:06:54,060
and needed to sober up.

143
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,230
I didn't know

144
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,380
the wine from this restaurant could be so intoxicating.

145
00:07:01,430 --> 00:07:02,990
I should have realized earlier

146
00:07:02,990 --> 00:07:05,110
that this restaurant belongs to you.

147
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:07,570
When you brought me here for a meal for the first time,

148
00:07:07,570 --> 00:07:10,170
you didn't just choose any restaurant, right?

149
00:07:10,330 --> 00:07:13,920
What's so strange about a noble owning a few private businesses?

150
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,770
Who would turn away from making money?

151
00:07:15,770 --> 00:07:17,370
I particularly love wealth.

152
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:20,460
What about running the charity hall?

153
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:23,060
That's a business with all costs and no profit.

154
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:25,550
What are Your Lordship's excuses this time?

155
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:26,400
What?

156
00:07:26,550 --> 00:07:29,650
Are you already starting to prepare to marry me?

157
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:32,480
As the future Duchess,

158
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:34,970
you've already started checking my assets?

159
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,890
Your Lordship, please don't joke about this.

160
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:39,750
I haven't agreed to marry you yet.

161
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:43,940
Let me take you home first.

162
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,070
When you've rested,

163
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:46,480
we can talk properly.

164
00:07:56,570 --> 00:07:58,890
My Lord, the Bai Residence is just ahead.

165
00:07:59,940 --> 00:08:00,640
Alright.

166
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:02,530
Don't get too close, or people will gossip.

167
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:04,370
Go inside and ask Lianxin to come out and receive her.

168
00:08:04,370 --> 00:08:05,500
Yes, Your Lordship.

169
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,230
I'm the one who wronged you.

170
00:08:10,890 --> 00:08:13,520
Wake up. You're home.

171
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:15,220
I'm sorry.

172
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:17,840
I'm the one who wronged you.

173
00:08:20,900 --> 00:08:21,950
Wake up.

174
00:08:21,970 --> 00:08:23,500
Can you forgive me?

175
00:08:32,049 --> 00:08:33,929
I forgive you. Wake up.

176
00:08:39,950 --> 00:08:41,070
What are you doing?

177
00:08:43,750 --> 00:08:45,200
What can I do?

178
00:08:45,410 --> 00:08:48,680
Haven't you always been the one doing things to me?

179
00:08:49,470 --> 00:08:50,600
-You...
-My Lady?

180
00:08:51,490 --> 00:08:53,130
My Lady, let me help you down.

181
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:05,040
Tao Yu.

182
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:06,320
Return to the mansion.

183
00:09:07,330 --> 00:09:08,230
Yes, Your Lordship.

184
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,270
Lianxin!

185
00:09:09,720 --> 00:09:10,780
I'll be going then!

186
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,230
My Lady, something terrible has happened.

187
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:15,460
We should hurry back to Bai's mansion now.

188
00:09:15,460 --> 00:09:16,340
What's wrong?

189
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:21,100
The Master said you are to accompany the Second Miss to the palace
and take care of her.

190
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:23,380
Send a message to Prince Yi for me.

191
00:09:23,380 --> 00:09:24,720
Tell him to meet me at Qingzhi Pavilion

192
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:25,860
when he's free tomorrow.

193
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:26,590
Yes, my Lady.

194
00:09:31,470 --> 00:09:32,690
I'm leaving these to you from now on.

195
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:34,240
Make sure to manage them well.

196
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,360
Look how profitable these are.

197
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,410
These shops...

198
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:37,840
Learn well from your mom.

199
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:38,600
Father.

200
00:09:41,830 --> 00:09:43,210
You're about to be married!

201
00:09:43,210 --> 00:09:44,710
Why do you keep going out every day?

202
00:09:44,710 --> 00:09:46,200
I went to check

203
00:09:46,220 --> 00:09:47,650
the dowry that my mother left me.

204
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,420
There are quite a few shops and properties,

205
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:51,110
and I haven't finished counting them all.

206
00:09:51,110 --> 00:09:51,540
How...

207
00:09:51,560 --> 00:09:52,640
how did you know about that?

208
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:54,700
In the previous life, didn't you withhold

209
00:09:54,700 --> 00:09:57,260
Bai Xiyao's dowry before her wedding?

210
00:10:03,920 --> 00:10:05,250
Before your mother passed away,

211
00:10:05,250 --> 00:10:06,720
she left you a dowry.

212
00:10:06,750 --> 00:10:09,210
Madam Mei has been managing it for you all these years.

213
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:10,850
Now that you're getting married,

214
00:10:10,850 --> 00:10:12,580
it should be handed over to you.

215
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,500
Then I would ask Madam Mei

216
00:10:16,520 --> 00:10:19,100
to provide me with a list of the shops.

217
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,140
Are you really this inconsiderate?

218
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,100
Once you marry the Duke,

219
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,630
you'll become the Duchess!

220
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:27,130
The Duke is wealthy and influential!

221
00:10:27,130 --> 00:10:29,350
Why would he care about these few small shops of yours?

222
00:10:29,350 --> 00:10:30,750
Now that you'll be living comfortably,

223
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,300
you're going to forget the family that raised you?

224
00:10:32,300 --> 00:10:34,390
What a waste all these years of raising you have turned out to be!

225
00:10:34,390 --> 00:10:36,520
What have I done wrong, Father?

226
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:38,030
Please tell me.

227
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:40,000
Xiyao,

228
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:41,730
your father is an honest official.

229
00:10:41,730 --> 00:10:43,660
When socializing with colleagues,

230
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,370
gatherings are unavoidable.

231
00:10:45,460 --> 00:10:48,220
Every year, during the birthday celebration and festivals
for that person in the palace,

232
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:50,620
our family must present valuable gifts.

233
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:52,610
You don't manage the household, so you don't know

234
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:54,820
that our family often spends more than we earn.

235
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,920
If it weren't for those few shops your mother left behind,

236
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,090
our family

237
00:10:59,110 --> 00:11:01,600
would barely be able to maintain appearances.

238
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:03,370
We'd become a laughingstock.

239
00:11:04,120 --> 00:11:05,280
I... I should have no worries about food and clothing

240
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,360
after I marry the Duke.

241
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:11,170
I have no interest in managing the shops my mother left behind.

242
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:13,420
Let everything remain as it is.

243
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:16,710
You'll be leaving this family.

244
00:11:17,070 --> 00:11:18,660
Although you still bear the surname Bai,

245
00:11:18,660 --> 00:11:20,780
you're already part of the Yun family.

246
00:11:20,780 --> 00:11:21,670
You should...

247
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:22,640
sign the transfer deed as soon as possible.

248
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:23,810
[Transfer Deed]

249
00:11:23,810 --> 00:11:25,800
This way, the Duke won't get the wrong idea.

250
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:28,060
I'll follow your arrangements, Father.

251
00:11:41,230 --> 00:11:44,810
No wonder the Empress Dowager insisted on your father
marrying that short-lived wretch.

252
00:11:44,810 --> 00:11:46,700
Just her daughter's dowry alone

253
00:11:46,720 --> 00:11:49,470
rivals the wealth of a noble in the palace.

254
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:53,460
These are all of Xiyao's dowry?

255
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,220
Now it's all yours.

256
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:00,440
Mom, you know it.

257
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:02,740
I want more than just this.

258
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,690
Good daughter, don't worry.

259
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:08,250
We have arranged everything for you.

260
00:12:16,450 --> 00:12:17,160
Lianxin.

261
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:21,150
I have made a copy of all the properties.

262
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:22,250
[Property List]

263
00:12:22,250 --> 00:12:25,580
This will make it easier for Madam Mei to verify everything.

264
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:30,450
Even if I run away from the wedding in the future,

265
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,610
leave the Bai family, and escape from the capital,

266
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:34,210
after converting these into silver notes,

267
00:12:34,210 --> 00:12:35,040
I would be

268
00:12:35,060 --> 00:12:37,460
living comfortably for the rest of my life.

269
00:12:37,790 --> 00:12:39,790
Are you really this inconsiderate?

270
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:41,100
Once you marry the Duke,

271
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:42,230
you'll become the Duchess!

272
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:43,580
The Duke is wealthy and influential!

273
00:12:43,580 --> 00:12:45,160
Why would he care about these few small shops of yours?

274
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,290
Now that you'll be living comfortably,

275
00:12:46,290 --> 00:12:47,790
you're going to forget the family that raised you?

276
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,750
What a waste

277
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,630
all these years of raising you have turned out to be.

278
00:12:51,850 --> 00:12:54,180
The Duke surely doesn't care about these,

279
00:12:54,650 --> 00:12:56,100
but His Lordship

280
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:57,800
already dislikes me.

281
00:12:57,930 --> 00:12:59,690
He's only following His Majesty's orders.

282
00:12:59,690 --> 00:13:01,400
Prince Yi harbors resentment

283
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,280
and will inevitably mistreat me.

284
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:05,690
If I don't have a dowry with me,

285
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,300
how can I win over the servants in the household

286
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,400
to serve me?

287
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,720
How will I buy new things

288
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,300
to please the Duke?

289
00:13:13,730 --> 00:13:15,160
Moreover,

290
00:13:15,190 --> 00:13:18,530
I haven't touched any of the property that my mother left for the family.

291
00:13:18,530 --> 00:13:20,230
Those are all part of my dowry.

292
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,250
How am I not caring about the family?

293
00:13:24,710 --> 00:13:27,280
Xiyao, your dowry has always been managed by my mom.

294
00:13:27,280 --> 00:13:28,530
If you take it over so hastily

295
00:13:28,530 --> 00:13:29,740
and aren't skilled at managing it,

296
00:13:29,740 --> 00:13:32,540
wouldn't that waste the late Mistress's good intentions?

297
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:34,740
It's better to keep it in the household.

298
00:13:34,760 --> 00:13:36,340
Xiyue, you're right.

299
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:39,850
Since Madam Mei is better at managing the business,

300
00:13:39,950 --> 00:13:41,340
then please, Father,

301
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:44,280
convert all these properties into money and give it to me instead.

302
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,660
That way, I'll have something to rely on

303
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,090
without having to worry,

304
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:50,210
while Madam Mei can continue to manage

305
00:13:50,210 --> 00:13:51,960
and enrich our family's assets.

306
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,880
Where's your mother?

307
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:54,120
Such an important family matter,

308
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:55,740
yet not even a trace of her can be seen.

309
00:13:55,740 --> 00:13:57,620
She has a slight headache

310
00:13:57,640 --> 00:13:59,140
and is resting in her room.

311
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,140
Then I'll excuse myself for now.

312
00:14:03,230 --> 00:14:04,800
Once Madam Mei has finished the accounts,

313
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,530
just send someone to inform me.

314
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:08,880
Wait!

315
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,030
I've been so distracted by your nonsense

316
00:14:11,030 --> 00:14:13,490
that I almost forgot the real matter at hand.

317
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,650
Father, I'll go ask Mom to come over right now.

318
00:14:22,150 --> 00:14:23,590
Lianxin, you may leave.

319
00:14:23,610 --> 00:14:24,980
This isn't something you should hear.

320
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,210
Yes, Lady Xiyue.

321
00:14:31,790 --> 00:14:32,810
Lianxin.

322
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,290
After I finish in the main hall,

323
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:37,350
go ahead and wait for me in my quarters.

324
00:14:37,350 --> 00:14:38,630
Yes, My Lady.

325
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,420
Your sister is about to enter the palace and become a consort.

326
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,280
You are her elder sister

327
00:14:47,280 --> 00:14:48,580
and are familiar with the palace.

328
00:14:48,580 --> 00:14:50,840
Accompany her into the palace, will you?

329
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:54,050
But my wedding to Prince Yi is drawing near.

330
00:14:54,070 --> 00:14:55,530
If I enter the palace at this time,

331
00:14:55,530 --> 00:14:57,170
I'm afraid there won't be enough time to prepare.
