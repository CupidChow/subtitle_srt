00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,390
[Episode 9]

3
00:00:52,450 --> 00:00:53,550
Miss Bai,

4
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:57,870
I'll accompany you to the Miscellaneous Silk Office right away.

5
00:00:57,890 --> 00:00:58,730
I can assure you,

6
00:00:58,750 --> 00:01:01,060
Steward Feng will issue the permit immediately.

7
00:01:01,080 --> 00:01:02,590
You can't leave.

8
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,410
Your Highness,

9
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,410
I have other matters to attend to.

10
00:01:07,430 --> 00:01:08,650
Please excuse me for not seeing you off.

11
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,750
Why?

12
00:01:10,150 --> 00:01:11,490
You don't need me

13
00:01:11,510 --> 00:01:13,130
to be your witness now?

14
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:15,170
Steward,

15
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:16,490
something's happened.

16
00:01:19,060 --> 00:01:20,430
What happened?

17
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,730
There's something in the kitchen that I need to deal with now.

18
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:25,120
I can't accompany you two anymore.

19
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:26,680
If you have any requests,

20
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,900
feel free to send someone.

21
00:01:27,930 --> 00:01:28,840
Farewell.

22
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,650
It's in the direction of the Imperial Kitchen's Jiading Court.

23
00:01:36,610 --> 00:01:37,789
Your Highness knows the way?

24
00:01:38,620 --> 00:01:40,229
Miss Bai, if you don't mind,

25
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:42,380
I could go for a walk to aid digestion.

26
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,700
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

27
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:48,520
Over there.

28
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,950
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,390
And over there too!

30
00:01:54,620 --> 00:01:55,570
Your Highness,

31
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,100
this is hardly conducive to digestion.

32
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:58,520
Perhaps you should go back.

33
00:01:58,539 --> 00:01:59,810
Up until now,

34
00:01:59,830 --> 00:02:02,150
you haven't said a word of thanks to me.

35
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,130
Here, here.

36
00:02:08,389 --> 00:02:09,259
Hurry up!

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:10,740
And here.

38
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:12,910
Well, you two noble guests,

39
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,070
this place is filthy

40
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:14,760
and chaotic.

41
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,420
Why have you come here?

42
00:02:16,450 --> 00:02:17,050
Well, Steward Sun,

43
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:17,900
let me ask you,

44
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:19,320
why are you here?

45
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,880
It can't be just because of these dead rats, right?

46
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,700
It's inevitable to have

47
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:25,000
some dead rats

48
00:02:25,030 --> 00:02:27,000
and insects in the kitchen.

49
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,020
I'm having people clean it up right now.

50
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:29,840
Is that so?

51
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:31,480
Steward Sun, do you think

52
00:02:31,510 --> 00:02:33,320
it's normal for these dead rats

53
00:02:33,350 --> 00:02:34,980
to appear here?

54
00:02:35,470 --> 00:02:37,610
When the border troops are short of

55
00:02:37,630 --> 00:02:38,700
food and supplies,

56
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:40,710
the sodiers

57
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,240
even consider dead rats

58
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,880
delicacies.

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,590
Such a number of dead rats appearing in the water channel

60
00:02:50,630 --> 00:02:52,210
will not only contaminate the water source,

61
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:53,590
but also cause epidemics.

62
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:56,020
This is the Empress Dowager's exclusive Imperial Kitchen,

63
00:02:56,110 --> 00:02:57,750
not some wild tavern.

64
00:02:57,800 --> 00:02:58,600
How can you speak so lightly

65
00:02:58,600 --> 00:02:59,230
and not understand

66
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:00,260
the gravity of the situation?

67
00:03:00,410 --> 00:03:01,350
Please forgive me.

68
00:03:01,380 --> 00:03:02,780
This matter is indeed suspicious.

69
00:03:02,810 --> 00:03:03,610
Steward Sun,

70
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:04,760
how can you speak so lightly

71
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,320
and not understand

72
00:03:06,350 --> 00:03:07,720
the gravity of the situation?

73
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:10,200
At first, I thought it was just a rat infestation,

74
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:12,120
but then for two consecutive days,

75
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,660
dead rats mysteriously appeared in the water channel.

76
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,960
With the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet approaching,

77
00:03:14,990 --> 00:03:16,530
this concerns the palace's food supply.

78
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,390
Concealing and not reporting it

79
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,560
is a grave offense.

80
00:03:21,710 --> 00:03:23,190
You may rise now.

81
00:03:23,740 --> 00:03:25,210
The most important thing now

82
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,240
is to investigate why

83
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:28,980
there are so many dead rats in the water channel.

84
00:03:29,290 --> 00:03:30,920
Steward Sun, where does

85
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,240
this water channel lead from the kitchen?

86
00:03:34,490 --> 00:03:35,730
It's, it's, it's...

87
00:03:35,750 --> 00:03:36,750
It's right over there,

88
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:37,870
in that direction.

89
00:03:57,180 --> 00:03:59,850
Miss Bai, do you have any thoughts on this matter?

90
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:03,200
I just examined the structure of the water channel.

91
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,550
It's connected to the vegetable pool.

92
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,420
There must be a problem with the water in the channel.

93
00:04:08,130 --> 00:04:08,780
By the way,

94
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,570
I found this in the pool.

95
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,350
This is...

96
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:21,060
A paper packet that contained medicine powder.

97
00:04:21,350 --> 00:04:23,020
Could those dead rats

98
00:04:23,290 --> 00:04:24,530
be related to this?

99
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,500
Perhaps this was washed over from that side of the water channel.

100
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,170
The rats upstream

101
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:31,520
must have drunk the water laced with this powder,

102
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:34,290
which is why they died in the channel.

103
00:04:34,310 --> 00:04:36,120
Could someone have deliberately poisoned them?

104
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:38,820
What could be their purpose?

105
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:40,020
The birthday banquet is

106
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,420
less than three days away.

107
00:04:41,659 --> 00:04:44,320
If we hadn't discovered the dead rats,

108
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,380
I'm afraid...

109
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:49,950
Go.

110
00:04:49,970 --> 00:04:52,380
Gather all the people from the Imperial Kitchen here.

111
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:53,020
Yes, sir.

112
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:01,030
Now

113
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,510
all the staff from the Imperial Kitchen are here.

114
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,810
Are you the ones working in the kitchen?

115
00:05:05,830 --> 00:05:07,600
Yes, that's right.

116
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:09,280
Wait,

117
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:10,530
there's also Xiang.

118
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:12,250
He didn't come today.

119
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:13,180
Oh, right.

120
00:05:13,200 --> 00:05:14,330
How could I forget about him?

121
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:15,570
Where did he go?

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,850
Who is Xiang?

123
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:18,390
He's a new eunuch who joined last month.

124
00:05:18,410 --> 00:05:20,000
He's been working in the kitchen.

125
00:05:20,020 --> 00:05:21,350
So where is he?

126
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:22,630
He took a day off today.

127
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,710
I see.

128
00:05:24,730 --> 00:05:25,650
You may go now.

129
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,390
Yes, sir.

130
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:35,020
It seems we need to investigate this Xiang

131
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,840
to find out what's really going on.

132
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:38,100
No need to investigate further.

133
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,159
He's probably already dead.

134
00:05:40,909 --> 00:05:42,400
Why do you say that, Miss Bai?

135
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:46,760
Whoever dared to do this

136
00:05:46,790 --> 00:05:48,659
must have some powerful backing.

137
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,810
I don't want to get involved in trouble.

138
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,560
Right now, clarifying the source of the water is the most critical.

139
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:57,260
I didn't expect you to have such insight.

140
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,130
Struggles in the palace

141
00:05:58,130 --> 00:05:59,740
are nothing more than these kinds of tricks.

142
00:05:59,970 --> 00:06:01,630
Your Highness has been at the border for a long time

143
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:02,980
and doesn't understand the ways of the palace.

144
00:06:09,230 --> 00:06:10,800
You haven't eaten yet?

145
00:06:12,430 --> 00:06:13,740
I've been busy all day.

146
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,100
There's no time to eat.

147
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:16,750
I'll take you somewhere.

148
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,180
Where?

149
00:06:26,550 --> 00:06:27,460
Delicious.

150
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
There are so many delicacies in the Imperial Kitchen.

151
00:06:30,630 --> 00:06:32,260
How could you be hungry?

152
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,000
I wouldn't dare to eat anything carelessly in the palace.

153
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:38,250
In my previous life, I was quietly poisoned to death.

154
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:39,409
Why?

155
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:42,600
Because of those dead rats.

156
00:06:50,940 --> 00:06:53,390
So, who exactly poisoned them?

157
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:54,930
Was it the other concubines?

158
00:06:54,950 --> 00:06:56,150
Or was it Pei Yan?

159
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:00,250
Miss Bai.

160
00:07:04,990 --> 00:07:05,850
Miss Bai.

161
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:09,900
What's wrong?

162
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,010
Miss Bai,

163
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,510
why do you sometimes deliberately avoid me?

164
00:07:14,050 --> 00:07:15,010
I...

165
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:17,940
I'm an unmarried young lady.

166
00:07:17,960 --> 00:07:19,910
Of course I have be mindful of propriety between men and women.

167
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:23,500
What propriety?

168
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:25,300
In our previous life,

169
00:07:25,330 --> 00:07:27,950
we were close together all the time.

170
00:07:38,060 --> 00:07:38,930
Good.

171
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,659
Xiyue, your beautiful music

172
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:44,600
is even more intoxicating than this fine wine.

173
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,250
Miss Bai, do you have someone you wish to marry?

174
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:53,050
Why did you ask that?

175
00:07:53,340 --> 00:07:55,370
I have no plans to marry.

176
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:56,430
I do.

177
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:57,920
And I'm in quite a hurry.

178
00:07:59,600 --> 00:08:00,390
[Marriage]

179
00:08:00,390 --> 00:08:02,300
Still couldn't escape this karmic flame.

180
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:04,990
Do I really have to marry Yun Yichen?

181
00:08:05,690 --> 00:08:06,930
I am full.

182
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:08,320
Thank you for treating me.

183
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:09,280
I'll take my leave now.

184
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,530
Someone really poisoned in the Imperial Kitchen?

185
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:16,500
Absolutely true.

186
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,590
Prince Yi was there too.

187
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:19,250
Prince Yi knows about it too?

188
00:08:19,270 --> 00:08:20,590
You didn't get into any trouble, did you?

189
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:22,030
I didn't make a fuss about it.

190
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:23,500
If they really investigate,

191
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,660
I'm the only outsider who's been in and out of the palace recently.

192
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:26,750
I'll definitely get into trouble.

193
00:08:26,780 --> 00:08:28,080
Yes.

194
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:29,430
This matter must be suppressed.

195
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,980
I'll go report to the Empress Dowager

196
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,470
and let her make the decision.

197
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,669
Father,

198
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,650
who on earth

199
00:08:35,679 --> 00:08:38,280
wants to poison people in the palace?

200
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:40,770
Who else could it be

201
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:42,730
but Prince Yi, Yun Yichen?

202
00:08:43,100 --> 00:08:44,260
How could that be possible?

203
00:08:44,290 --> 00:08:46,110
He even investigated it with me.

204
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:47,020
And

205
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,270
why would he do such a thing?

206
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,790
This Duke of Zhen's Mansion

207
00:08:50,810 --> 00:08:52,300
has deep-rooted grudges with the palace.

208
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,730
The Empress Dowager has never liked Prince Yi's aunt, Consort Xian.

209
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,110
Don't be fooled by him.

210
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,540
He saw that you became suspicious,

211
00:08:57,560 --> 00:08:58,560
and went along with it

212
00:08:58,580 --> 00:08:59,900
just to clear his name.

213
00:09:00,610 --> 00:09:02,920
This matter should have nothing to do with Yun Yichen.

214
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:05,440
The key lies in the cause of the rat's death.

215
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,990
The paper packet

216
00:09:12,010 --> 00:09:14,160
smells of night vine flowers and honey dew,

217
00:09:14,230 --> 00:09:16,000
which is why the rats ate it by mistake.

218
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:18,830
It shows that the poison was meant for humans.

[Imperial Kitchen][Imperial Kitchen Jiading Court]

220
00:09:21,790 --> 00:09:23,900
If someone wanted to poison the Imperial Kitchen,

221
00:09:24,020 --> 00:09:25,200
many people in the Cining Palace

222
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:26,730
would have been poisoned.

223

[Imperial Kitchen][Imperial Kitchen Jiading Court]

224
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:27,400
But so far, only the rats have died from the poison.

[Dead rats at the back door of the Imperial Kitchen]

226
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:30,600
So the poison wasn't

227
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:33,110
aimed at the Imperial Kitchen.

228
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,970

the Imperial Kitchen is to the west of the Imperial Hospital.

231
00:09:37,530 --> 00:09:40,300
The rats ate something poisonous in the Imperial Hospital,

232
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,360

It makes people thirsty after eating.

238
00:09:51,550 --> 00:09:52,860
I want to drink alcohol.

239
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:55,740
Isn't this...

240
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:59,290
the Love-Slave Elixir I used in my last life?

241
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:03,300
This is our Bai family's ancestral secret medicine,

242
00:10:03,330 --> 00:10:04,840
Love-Slave Elixir.

243
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:06,530
It's extremely difficult to refine

244
00:10:06,550 --> 00:10:08,220
and hard to preserve for long.

245
00:10:08,370 --> 00:10:11,220
If you give it to Yun Yichen,

246
00:10:11,250 --> 00:10:14,400
he will gradually fall deeply in love with you

247
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:16,220
and be at your beck and call.

248
00:10:18,650 --> 00:10:20,430
But if I do this,

249
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:23,090
won't it make Cousin Yan

250
00:10:23,110 --> 00:10:24,230
unhappy?

251
00:10:24,260 --> 00:10:27,430
As long as you have value and means,

252
00:10:28,280 --> 00:10:31,480
no one can take your position as the Empress.

253
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,180
I will certainly not disappoint you, Great-aunt.

254
00:10:39,700 --> 00:10:40,530
In my last life,

255
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,980
I used the Love-Slave Elixir

256
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,430
to gradually control Yun Yichen,

257
00:10:44,460 --> 00:10:46,000
making him distance himself from his confidants,

261
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:55,560
I've recently acquired a rare medicine that can

help you replenish your vital energy

and cure your old ailments.

264
00:10:59,820 --> 00:11:00,590
Really?

265
00:11:01,020 --> 00:11:04,110
Is there really a medicine that can cure me now?

266
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,690
Yichen, why don't you

267
00:11:13,980 --> 00:11:15,600
give it a try?

268
00:11:45,530 --> 00:11:46,860

269
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:49,580
My Lord,

270
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:50,850
please stop drinking.

271
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,480
You have to attend the morning court tomorrow.

272
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,000
What morning court?

273
00:11:56,690 --> 00:11:58,600
His Majesty, out of consideration for my health,

274
00:11:59,110 --> 00:12:01,310
has allowed me not to attend daily.

275
00:12:03,470 --> 00:12:04,380
My Lord,

276
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,100
a true man should strive for excellence,

277
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:07,330
with ambitions for the world.

278
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:08,720
How can you let yourself

279
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:10,720
be consumed by wine and pleasure every day?

280
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,500
Who do you think you are

281
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:16,830
to dare lecture me?

282
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:19,390
My Lord,

283
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:21,160
even if you don't care about those soldiers

284

of Yun's Army who risk their lives for you,

285
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,730
you can't forget the vengeance for the old lord and madam.

Your current state

287
00:12:29,230 --> 00:12:30,440
only brings pain to those who care about you

288

and joy to your enemies.

Who allows you to mention them?

291

Get out!

292
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,740
Get out!

293
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,060
I said get out!

294
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:42,910
As a servant,

295
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,670
why do you keep bringing up his painful memories?

296
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,470
Are you trying to defy your superiors?

297
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:50,420
I'm returning to the border.

298
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,240
Even as a mere squad leader,

299
00:12:52,270 --> 00:12:53,570
I can still guard the pass for my country.

300
00:12:54,440 --> 00:12:55,960
Please, My Lord,

301
00:12:57,210 --> 00:12:58,100
take care of yourself.

302
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:01,530
Yun Yichen is determined to avenge his parents.

303
00:13:01,570 --> 00:13:03,740
You think I don't want revenge?

304
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:05,460
But I'm useless!

305
00:13:05,490 --> 00:13:07,620
I'm useless!

306
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,810
But he was poisoned by the Love-Slave Elixir

307
00:13:10,140 --> 00:13:11,610
and fell into depravity.

308
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:12,840
Be good.

309
00:13:13,010 --> 00:13:14,460
Take your medicine properly.

310
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:18,060

311
00:13:19,660 --> 00:13:20,990
I want to drink wine.

312
00:13:22,790 --> 00:13:23,890
I want to drink wine.

313
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:28,170
You'll definitely recover.

314
00:13:31,260 --> 00:13:32,300
But...

315
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,150
who did

316
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,100
this thing appear so early?

[Duke of Zhen's Mansion]

318
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:42,650
Lately,

319
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,600
you should take more care of your sister.

320
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:46,080
No need to serve me all the time.

321
00:13:46,140 --> 00:13:47,670
Qiao'er is recovering at the clinic.

322
00:13:48,030 --> 00:13:49,540
I visit her every day.

323
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:54,160
About her identity,

324
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:55,860
don't reveal it yet.

325
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,510
After all,

326
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:59,350
it concerns the Duke's Mansion and the Minister of Rites' Mansion.

327
00:13:59,510 --> 00:14:01,110
We don't want to be plotted against.

328
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,230
Understood.

329
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:03,960
I'll continue to call her Lianxin.

330
00:14:06,630 --> 00:14:07,850
How's the investigation

331
00:14:07,870 --> 00:14:09,100
into the kitchen going?

332
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,100
That Xiang went back to his hometown to visit his family.

333
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:13,610
Judging by the timing,

334
00:14:13,630 --> 00:14:14,790
he doesn't seem suspicious of poisoning.

335
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,880
It seems we're investigating in the wrong direction.

336
00:14:18,590 --> 00:14:19,530
No need to investigate further.

337
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:22,040
He's probably already dead.

338
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,010
Whoever dared to do this

339
00:14:24,150 --> 00:14:25,790
must have some powerful backing.

340
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:28,290
No wonder she had that expression at the time.

341
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:30,930
I also found out,

342
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:31,780
that Xiang

343
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,680
and Madam Mei from the Bai family are from the same hometown.

344
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:36,530
I wonder if it's a coincidence or if there's a connection.

345
00:14:37,210 --> 00:14:38,220
Well,

346
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,160
the Minister of Rites

347
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,330
has actually planted a spy in

348
00:14:42,360 --> 00:14:43,340
his own aunt's palace.

349
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:45,650
It seems he has other plans.

350
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:46,900
I've asked the people from the charity hall

351
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:49,460
to keep an eye out for any suspicious individuals

352
00:14:49,540 --> 00:14:51,300
entering the city from the suburbs recently.

353
00:14:51,730 --> 00:14:53,060
Miss Bai actually went to

354
00:14:53,090 --> 00:14:55,850
our subordinate charity hall to distribute porridge

355
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:57,350
and was attacked

356
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:58,870
but emerged unscathed.

357
00:14:58,960 --> 00:15:00,520
And her personal maid

358
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:03,120
is your long-lost sister.

359
00:15:04,670 --> 00:15:06,810
I think Miss Bai is a good person.

360
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:08,070
Lianxin said

361
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:10,290
Miss Bai has never mistreated the servants.

362
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,120
She's just been

363
00:15:11,150 --> 00:15:13,760
less timid and introverted lately,

364
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,690
and has become more alert and spirited.

365
00:15:15,950 --> 00:15:17,460
Her appearance at the charity hall

366
00:15:17,510 --> 00:15:18,790
must be a coincidence.

367
00:15:20,460 --> 00:15:22,630
I don't believe in coincidences.

368
00:15:23,460 --> 00:15:25,400
If we hadn't gone to the charity hall to investigate,

369
00:15:25,580 --> 00:15:27,280
we wouldn't have met your sister.

370
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,690
Everything is either

371
00:15:28,710 --> 00:15:29,690
man-made

372
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,140
or by divine will.

373
00:15:31,790 --> 00:15:35,100
Everything seems to point to a predestined outcome.

374
00:15:36,890 --> 00:15:38,280
I don't understand.

375
00:15:38,310 --> 00:15:39,680
In a few days,

376
00:15:39,870 --> 00:15:41,450
it will be the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

377
00:15:42,390 --> 00:15:44,690
I'm looking forward to Bai Xiyao's performance.

378
00:15:45,430 --> 00:15:47,650
[Cining Hall]

379
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,390
Xiyao is truly virtuous and talented.

380
00:15:51,420 --> 00:15:53,050
The arrangement of this banquet

381
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:54,520
is quite innovative.

382
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:56,880
I am very pleased with it.

383
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,670
In the last life, Bai Xiyao

384
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,930
lost favor.

385
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,400
The Empress Dowager asked me to arrange the birthday banquet.

386
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,430
Truly virtuous and talented.

387
00:16:01,450 --> 00:16:05,240
-Is Bai Xiyao confined to her room copying women's virtues?
-This banquet arrangement suits my taste.

388
00:16:05,510 --> 00:16:08,700
As expected of a child raised by our Bai family.

389
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,180
I'm flattered.

390
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:11,260
Great-aunt,

391
00:16:11,290 --> 00:16:13,160
you've entrusted such an important task to me,

392
00:16:13,250 --> 00:16:14,730
and I will certainly not disappoint you.
