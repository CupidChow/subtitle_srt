[Episode 7]

3
00:00:50,980 --> 00:00:52,220
Let me go.

4
00:00:52,240 --> 00:00:52,910
Don't go and get yourself killed.

5
00:00:52,930 --> 00:00:54,080
Brother!

6
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,450
Are you lying to me?

7
00:00:57,700 --> 00:00:58,930
What proof do you have?

8
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,530
Back then, someone who still remembers this matter

9
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,540
is Steward Gui, who returned home.

10
00:01:02,670 --> 00:01:05,360
I can bring him back to confront you.

11
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:09,380
In my past life,

12
00:01:09,410 --> 00:01:11,180
I was willful and arrogant, and made a grave mistake,

13
00:01:11,210 --> 00:01:12,750
yet remained completely unaware.

14
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,180
In this life, Bai Xiyue clearly knows the truth

15
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,150
but still wants to frame Bai Xiyao.

16
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:19,400
Lianxin,

17
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:23,130
you clearly could've killed me just now,

18
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:24,880
but you saved me instead.

19
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:25,940
Lianxin,

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:27,260
you're not evil by nature.

21
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:28,620
Don't let yourself be used.

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:31,289
Come back with me.

23
00:01:31,530 --> 00:01:33,060
I'll give you an explanation.

24
00:01:33,910 --> 00:01:35,300
My Lady.

25
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:36,509
If you don't dare to kill her,

26
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:37,710
then I'll do it.

27
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:40,710
My Lady!

28
00:01:41,870 --> 00:01:42,910
Lianxin!

29
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:45,640
No time to worry about that!

30
00:01:47,289 --> 00:01:48,180
What's going on?

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,370
You have inner strength?

32
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:58,850
Are you alright?

33
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:04,500
My Lord.

34
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:05,980
He committed suicide by poison.

35
00:02:07,210 --> 00:02:08,539
Quick, save her!

36
00:02:09,470 --> 00:02:10,139
Bai Xiyao!

37
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,000
Bai Xiyao!

38
00:02:15,340 --> 00:02:16,140
Master Yuan,

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:17,010
how is she?

40
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:19,090
Miss Bai was too exhausted

41
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,220
and fell asleep.

42
00:02:22,910 --> 00:02:24,130
I, the celestial maiden,

43
00:02:24,329 --> 00:02:26,400
am boundless in celestial power.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,210
Don't even think of harming me.

45
00:02:31,070 --> 00:02:32,300
It's fine.

46
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,290
As long as Miss Bai wakes up.

47
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:42,570
Are you alright?

48
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:43,660
Are you badly hurt?

49
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:44,829
My Lady.

50
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:46,760
I should've died

51
00:02:47,050 --> 00:02:48,670
to atone for my sins.

52
00:02:49,310 --> 00:02:50,950
Don't say such nonsense.

53
00:02:50,980 --> 00:02:52,400
What sin have you committed?

54
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:54,360
You were just being used,

55
00:02:54,380 --> 00:02:56,350
and today's assassination was her doing as well.

56
00:02:56,370 --> 00:02:58,340
She never intended for either of us to return alive.

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,580
I have a carriage

58
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,410
and can escort Miss Bai safely back to the city.

59
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:04,530
Tao Yu.

60
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,510
Why did Yun Yichen suddenly appear?

61
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,100
It's best to keep your distance from him.

62
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:10,630
Thank you for your kindness, Prince Yi,

63
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:12,250
but we also brought a carriage from our residence.

64
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,480
There's no need for you to trouble himself.

65
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,850
Tao Yu,

66
00:03:16,970 --> 00:03:17,840
why are you dazing off?

67
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,540
May I ask, Miss Lianxin,

68
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,130
where are you from?

69
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,400
What's your childhood name?

70
00:03:25,430 --> 00:03:26,790
Do you have any older brothers?

71
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:32,010
I'm from Huangqijia Village in the outskirts of the capital.

72
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:33,540
I'm the second child in the family.

73
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,900
My parents called me Qiao'er.

74
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,290
Qiao'er...

75
00:03:38,060 --> 00:03:39,829
Do you still remember how we fled into the mountains

76
00:03:39,850 --> 00:03:41,290
and caught pheasants to stave off hunger?

77
00:03:42,270 --> 00:03:43,220
In the end,

78
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,400
we only caught this one tail feather.

79
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:54,750
He's the mute boy from back then!

80
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:56,620
Brother,

81
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:58,770
is it really you?

82
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,530
You're still alive?

83
00:04:03,550 --> 00:04:05,150
I've been alive all along.

84
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,090
I've been searching for you all these years.

85
00:04:08,110 --> 00:04:09,540
It's been ten years.

86
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,060
B-Brother,

87
00:04:17,290 --> 00:04:20,040
you… you can speak now?

88
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:21,940
It was the Duke.

89
00:04:41,130 --> 00:04:41,900
My Lord.

90
00:04:41,930 --> 00:04:42,860
He was a little beggar.

91
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,730
What happened to him?

92
00:04:43,750 --> 00:04:44,940
Is he still alive?

93
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:46,170
Seems he still has a breath.

94
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:46,920
We found a feather

95
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:48,440
and pottery shard on him.

96
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,470
I'll carry him.

97
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,690
Don't let him slow down our journey.

98
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:51,560
Put him on the cart.

99
00:04:51,580 --> 00:04:52,730
I want to save him.

100
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:53,400
This...

101
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:54,490
Okay.

102
00:05:03,340 --> 00:05:04,800
You're finally awake.

103
00:05:04,820 --> 00:05:06,420
You've been unconscious for seven or eight days.

104
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:10,210
Quick, get up.

105
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:12,690
Your throat problem is an old condition from childhood.

106
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:15,400
It will take time to fully recover.

107
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:21,410
What's your name?

108
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,030
When we found you,

109
00:05:24,050 --> 00:05:26,350
you only had a pottery shard and a feather.

110
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:28,020
So we called you Tao Yu.

111
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:29,800
Tao Yu…

112
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:35,330
His Lordship cured my throat.

113
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:38,659
He was the one who saved me when I was abandoned in the wild.

114
00:05:40,510 --> 00:05:41,570
My Lady.

115
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,320
He's my brother.

116
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,070
Thank you, My Lord, for saving my brother's life.

117
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,520
No need for formalities, Miss Lianxin.

118
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:48,860
Tao Yu,

119
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,790
hurry and take your sister into the city for treatment.

120
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,460
You'll have time to catch up later.

121
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:53,990
Yes, My Lord.

122
00:06:25,690 --> 00:06:27,320
Let's return to the city quickly.

123
00:06:27,350 --> 00:06:29,090
This is too exhausting.

124
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:31,190
Who would've thought the person Tao Yu saved today

125
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,240
was the sister he had been searching for.

126
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:34,100
Indeed.

127
00:06:34,260 --> 00:06:35,640
A heartfelt reunion.

128
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,990
It's wonderful.

129
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,100
I too

130
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:40,090
have someone I wish to find.

131
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:41,670
But we've yet to meet.

132
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:43,409
Who asked you?

133
00:06:43,450 --> 00:06:45,150
Don't just talk to fill the silence, okay?

134
00:06:45,170 --> 00:06:47,870
Then I wish you early success in his search.

135
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,380
That depends on whether little Bai is willing.

136
00:06:54,409 --> 00:06:55,340
Me?

137
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:59,140
I don't understand what you mean.

138
00:07:01,660 --> 00:07:02,950
You lied

139
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,290
about the sachet.

140
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:20,150
Darling…

141
00:07:21,570 --> 00:07:23,120
Xiyue, why are you here?

142
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:24,030
Xiyao.

143
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:26,320
I came to seek guidance in music from Brother Yichen,

144
00:07:26,340 --> 00:07:28,720
so I can perform at the new emperor's coronation.

145
00:07:28,870 --> 00:07:30,080
Why are you here?

146
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:34,650
I noticed your sachet was worn,

147
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:36,870
so I brought you a new one.

148
00:07:38,409 --> 00:07:40,260
I already have a suitable sachet.

149
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:42,460
Who told you to do such a useless thing?

150
00:07:42,480 --> 00:07:43,350
Xiyao,

151
00:07:43,670 --> 00:07:44,780
that sachet

152
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:47,220
was one I gave to Brother Yichen when we were children.

153
00:07:54,350 --> 00:07:56,920
I'm his wife now.

154
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:58,800
Aren't you

155
00:07:58,820 --> 00:08:00,870
being a bit too close with Xiyue?

156
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:10,090
Xiyue and I have been close since childhood.

157
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,330
Besides, she's your sister.

158
00:08:12,360 --> 00:08:14,700
I didn't think you'd be so jealous.

159
00:08:14,730 --> 00:08:16,100
I'm truly disappointed.

160
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:17,420
Xiyue,

161
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:18,520
let's go.

162
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,460
Trying to prove

163
00:08:27,490 --> 00:08:29,920
you're the rightful owner of the sachet with your embroidery?

164
00:08:29,940 --> 00:08:31,940
Brother Yichen's favor

165
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:35,440
isn't something you can exchange with just a new sachet.

166
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:52,340
In my past life, I did lie about my identity.

167
00:08:54,020 --> 00:08:55,910
But now, isn't Bai Xiyao's identity

168
00:08:56,440 --> 00:08:58,290
a lie as well?

169
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:00,850
This sachet

170
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:02,360
was hand-stitched for me by little Bai.

171
00:09:02,630 --> 00:09:04,100
It's exactly the same as yours.

172
00:09:04,190 --> 00:09:05,510
Where did yours come from?

173
00:09:05,750 --> 00:09:08,820
So there really was only one sachet given to Yun Yichen.

174
00:09:09,330 --> 00:09:11,530
Who forged the second sachet

175
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:13,370
to lure Bai Xiyao to Wangxin Lake?

176
00:09:13,430 --> 00:09:15,130
She just made two identical ones, that's all.

177
00:09:15,150 --> 00:09:16,510
What's so strange about that?

178
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:19,890
Besides, who remembers things from childhood so clearly?

179
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,830
It wasn't you, so of course you don't care.

180
00:09:28,660 --> 00:09:31,780
Why were you at the charity hall?

181
00:09:33,290 --> 00:09:34,550
Where I go

182
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:36,650
has nothing to do with you, does it?

183
00:09:49,850 --> 00:09:52,780
Thank you, thank you, My Lord.

184
00:09:54,470 --> 00:09:55,860
Even if you're thanking me,

185
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:57,510
there's no need to bow so deeply.

186
00:09:58,880 --> 00:09:59,790
I thank you

187
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:02,680
for saving my life, Prince Yi.

188
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,950
The person who tried to assassinate you today

189
00:10:07,970 --> 00:10:10,370
was highly trained from planning to execution.

190
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,580
After failing, he committed suicide immediately

191
00:10:13,770 --> 00:10:15,850
to prevent revealing his employer.

192
00:10:15,890 --> 00:10:16,940
It appears

193
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:18,490
to be the work of Luozhi Hall.

194
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:22,170
Luozhi Hall?

195
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:24,280
You know of Luozhi Hall?

196
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:30,430
I heard storytellers at teahouses mention it.

197
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:33,560
Didn't expect you, a noble daughter,

198
00:10:33,580 --> 00:10:35,020
to be so well-informed.

199
00:10:35,510 --> 00:10:38,430
Luozhi Hall isn't just an assassination organization.

200
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:40,270
They also excel at setting traps.

201
00:10:40,530 --> 00:10:41,690
In my past life,

202
00:10:41,720 --> 00:10:43,780
I was the one who framed Bai Xiyao with their help.

203
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:44,550
[Yanxia Pavilion]

204
00:10:52,990 --> 00:10:53,960
Welcome, miss.

205
00:10:53,980 --> 00:10:55,090
Feel free to look around.

206
00:10:55,330 --> 00:10:57,450
All my rouge and powder are of the finest quality.

207
00:10:57,470 --> 00:10:58,590
Whatever you choose,

208
00:10:58,610 --> 00:10:59,770
put it on my tab.

209
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:04,410
Thank you, My Lady.

210
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:09,780
My Lady,

211
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:11,240
I have an urgent matter to report.

212
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:12,200
Speak.

213
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:15,890
Third Prince visited Bai Xiyao last night.

214
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:17,960
How did Yun Yichen react?

215
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,960
Third Prince snuck into the mansion at night.

216
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:21,640
His Lordship was unaware.

217
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,000
A secret meeting?

218
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:25,890
What did they say?

219
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:28,030
Third Prince wanted to take the lady away,

220
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:29,550
but she refused.

221
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:31,850
Third Prince is deeply devoted to her,

222
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,270
saying he will never give up no matter what,

223
00:11:34,290 --> 00:11:36,250
and is determined to take her away from the Duke's Mansion.

224
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:40,120
If Pei Yan had half the affection for me that he has for Bai Xiyao,

225
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:43,270
I would've already had the Empress Dowager arrange our marriage.

226
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,300
In the end,

227
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:46,350
as long as Bai Xiyao remains,

228
00:11:46,870 --> 00:11:49,900
Pei Yan won't give his heart to me.

229
00:11:49,930 --> 00:11:52,250
When do you plan to kill Bai Xiyao, My Lady?

230
00:11:52,430 --> 00:11:54,480
Killing her is never the goal.

231
00:11:55,030 --> 00:11:57,830
I need Bai Xiyao to be my stepping stone.

232
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,900
Once I step over her to reach the top,

233
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:04,310
I'll crush her completely.

234
00:12:10,280 --> 00:12:10,930
Yes.

235
00:12:11,660 --> 00:12:12,980
What should I do?

236
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,640
I've already had people from Luozhi Hall set the plan.

237
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:16,660
When the time comes,

238
00:12:16,690 --> 00:12:18,450
you'll lure her to Yanxia Pavilion.

239
00:12:18,530 --> 00:12:20,930
I've prepared a good show for her.

240
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,010
Yes.

241
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,730
Ever since Bai Xiyao was disfigured,

242
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,170
Yun Yichen has despised her.

243
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:27,100
-Madam, the food has gone cold again.
-She became a resentful woman trapped in the inner chambers.

244
00:12:28,530 --> 00:12:29,700
Reheat it.

245
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:32,880
But if we reheat it again, it won't be edible.

246
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,290
Then make another table of dishes.

247
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,040
It's almost the hour of Hai now.

248
00:12:38,230 --> 00:12:41,330
His Lordship has likely dined outside already.

249
00:12:43,550 --> 00:12:44,450
Reporting, Madam.

250
00:12:44,470 --> 00:12:46,500
His Lordship will stay at Qingzhi Pavilion tonight.

251
00:12:46,530 --> 00:12:47,740
He won't be returning.

252
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:50,530
Madam,

253
00:12:50,550 --> 00:12:52,620
His Lordship doesn't usually send word

254
00:12:52,650 --> 00:12:54,760
when he's not returning to the mansion.

255
00:12:55,520 --> 00:12:56,910
That Qingzhi Pavilion

256
00:12:56,930 --> 00:12:59,360
is the courtyard the Empress Dowager granted Bai Xiyue.

257
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,730
Isn't that an open provocation?

258
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:03,370
Such blatant bullying.

259
00:13:04,260 --> 00:13:05,270
Clear the dishes.

260
00:13:05,470 --> 00:13:06,500
I'm tired.

261
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:07,600
I'll go back to rest.

262
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,950
But you haven't taken a bite.

263
00:13:10,070 --> 00:13:11,140
I can't eat.

264
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:12,120
I've lost my appetite.

265
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:14,970
Madam,

266
00:13:15,080 --> 00:13:17,470
why not visit Yanxia Pavilion tomorrow,

267
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:18,830
pick out some rouge and powder?

268
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,830
Go by yourself.

269
00:13:21,860 --> 00:13:23,120
I'll grant you half a day off.

270
00:13:23,190 --> 00:13:24,120
Madam,

271
00:13:24,140 --> 00:13:26,660
I heard they've just received a new batch of pearl cream.

272
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:27,810
Apply it to your face,

273
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,620
it smooths out wrinkles remarkably well.

274
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,590
Why don't you give it a try?

275
00:13:31,620 --> 00:13:34,120
Maybe then His Lordship won't go out anymore.

276
00:13:37,800 --> 00:13:39,550
Why would that work?

277
00:13:40,030 --> 00:13:41,910
It's just a marketing gimmick.

278
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:43,230
Madam,

279
00:13:43,250 --> 00:13:45,250
you're idle all day anyway,

280
00:13:45,270 --> 00:13:46,540
why not come with me,

281
00:13:46,570 --> 00:13:47,690
just to pass the time?

282
00:13:54,370 --> 00:13:57,510
[Yanxia Pavilion]

283
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,020
Madam's beauty is remarkable,

284
00:14:13,050 --> 00:14:14,300
yet flawed like jade with a blemish.

285
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,990
The heavens must be jealous of such a face.

286
00:14:16,010 --> 00:14:17,000
Rest assured,

287
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:19,640
with my pearl cream,

288
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:22,030
you'll surely be reborn.

289
00:14:23,730 --> 00:14:24,670
Truly?

290
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,370
Our Si family's craft spans a hundred years.

291
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,860
You'll know with one try.

292
00:14:38,670 --> 00:14:39,540
Lianxin,

293
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:41,070
go pick what you like.

294
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,610
Yes, My Lady.

295
00:15:04,660 --> 00:15:06,360
Madam, look at this.

296
00:15:10,140 --> 00:15:12,240
The scars are indeed less visible.

297
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,020
Only…

298
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:19,260
If we had treated it properly back then,

299
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:20,310
Madam's face

300
00:15:20,330 --> 00:15:21,570
wouldn't have ended up like this.

301
00:15:22,270 --> 00:15:25,330
I've added centella asiatica to this pearl cream.

302
00:15:25,350 --> 00:15:26,950
As long as you keep using it,

303
00:15:26,980 --> 00:15:29,050
the scars will surely fade.

304
00:15:30,690 --> 00:15:32,450
Then wrap all of these up.

305
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:33,830
Very well.

306
00:15:33,850 --> 00:15:35,070
Please continue browsing.

307
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:39,930
Lianxin,

308
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:40,840
have you picked?

309
00:15:41,620 --> 00:15:42,340
Madam,

310
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,730
I still need to fetch a lip balm.

311
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:48,250
Miss,

312
00:15:48,280 --> 00:15:49,140
I'm terribly sorry.

313
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,500
I was in a rush.

314
00:15:50,530 --> 00:15:52,290
I'll pay for whatever was damaged.

315
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:53,300
You seem like

316
00:15:53,330 --> 00:15:54,890
a scholarly gentleman.

317
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:55,780
Why would you come to

318
00:15:55,800 --> 00:15:57,800
a makeup shop full of women?

319
00:15:57,880 --> 00:15:59,760
Lianxin, don't be rude.

320
00:15:59,780 --> 00:16:00,660
You were the one who rushed

321
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:01,810
and bumped into the gentleman.

322
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:04,570
I sell calligraphy and paintings,

323
00:16:04,590 --> 00:16:05,460
saving up some silver

324
00:16:05,480 --> 00:16:07,380
to buy a birthday gift for my mother.

325
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,510
Truly a filial son.

326
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,250
Miss, may I ask,

327
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,670
which family are you from?

328
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:16,770
That dress hem won't be easy to clean.

329
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:17,890
I, sunamed Zhao, will surely send silver

330
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,690
to your residence.

331
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:21,580
I'm no noble lady.

332
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,170
I'm a maidservant of the Duke of Zhen's Mansion.

333
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,390
My name is Lianxin.

334
00:16:24,660 --> 00:16:26,380
Greetings, Madam.
