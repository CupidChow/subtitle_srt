[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:46,450
[Episode 18]

3
00:00:46,550 --> 00:00:47,960
So what if it's Prince Yi?

4
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,500
Can he be more important than your sister?

5
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:50,550
Xiyue will be

6
00:00:50,570 --> 00:00:51,870
a royal consort.

7
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:53,640
The emperor has the final say

8
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:56,720
about your marriage, don't you think?

9
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:00,090
My dearest father,

10
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:02,990
that's exactly what I'd love to hear.

11
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:04,950
I can easily cancel the engagement

12
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:06,950
with the Emperor's help, right?

13
00:01:07,990 --> 00:01:09,450
Whatever you see fit, Dad.

14
00:01:16,670 --> 00:01:17,539
Master,

15
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:19,310
my father sent him here.

16
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,130
Three generations of his family have worked for the Mei family.

17
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:23,580
He's trustworthy.

18
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:24,570
Can you cook?

19
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:25,780
Can you read?

20
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:26,600
Master,

21
00:01:27,330 --> 00:01:29,990
I've been a kitchen worker since I was 12.

22
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,550
I also procure grocery.

23
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,830
I can read menus.

24
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:35,720
That's good enough.

25
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:37,509
I'll send you to the royal palace in three days

26
00:01:37,509 --> 00:01:38,630
to work in the Imperial Kitchen.

27
00:01:38,630 --> 00:01:39,720
Keep your mouth shut

28
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:41,050
and focus on observing and learning.

29
00:01:41,050 --> 00:01:41,840
When the time comes,

30
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,630
you'll be assigned important tasks.

31
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:44,039
Yes.

32
00:01:44,060 --> 00:01:45,000
I got it.

33
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:47,720
Spend the next few days in a charity hall outside the city.

34
00:01:47,720 --> 00:01:49,289
Do not let anyone know

35
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,640
you're connected to the Bai family.

36
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,640
Yes, ma'am.

37
00:01:53,420 --> 00:01:54,210
Wait.

38
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:56,660
There is a task for you.

39
00:01:57,030 --> 00:01:58,229
Yes, Master.

40
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,730
Leave through the rear door,

41
00:02:02,730 --> 00:02:04,050
and then go to the front door.

42
00:02:04,050 --> 00:02:05,510
Visit Songlan Court

43
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:08,090
and give this sachet to Ms. Xiyao.

44
00:02:09,570 --> 00:02:10,169
Yes.

45
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,470
I got it.

46
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:15,130
Master,

47
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:16,650
what is in that sachet?

48
00:02:16,730 --> 00:02:18,880
Why did you have a stranger send it to Xiyao?

49
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:20,480
Since Xiyao returned from the palace,

50
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,310
she has strictly followed the Empress Dowager's instructions

51
00:02:22,310 --> 00:02:23,750
and never left the Minister's Mansion

52
00:02:23,750 --> 00:02:25,530
or contacted any strange men,

53
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:26,380
just to ensure that she can

54
00:02:26,380 --> 00:02:28,630
marry Prince Yan without accidents.

55
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,170
But when she receives this sachet,

56
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:33,070
she'll definitely leave the mansion for a meetup.

57
00:02:33,070 --> 00:02:34,170
Will that work?

58
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,660
Won't she realize it's a trick?

59
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:36,390
I had

60
00:02:36,410 --> 00:02:39,490
that sachet made by the embroiderer who used to be Xiyao's tutor.

61
00:02:39,490 --> 00:02:40,890
It was deliberately aged

62
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:42,490
to look identical to the real one.

63
00:02:42,490 --> 00:02:43,780
I need you to find two reliable men

64
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,890
to kidnap Xiyao.

65
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,400
Once word gets out about her missing,

66
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,710
have the guys set her free.

67
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,960
I understand.

68
00:02:50,620 --> 00:02:51,420
Hold on.

69
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:55,560
Remember not to endanger her life.

70
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,950
If those guys dare to sexually assault Xiyao,

71
00:02:57,950 --> 00:03:00,320
I'll cut off the limbs of their families.

72
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,050
Yes.

73
00:03:14,410 --> 00:03:15,860
Just tell her the truth.

74
00:03:16,290 --> 00:03:18,100
Don't hide anything about me.

75
00:03:18,290 --> 00:03:19,829
Or she might get suspicious.

76
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:20,500
This will help us

77
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,730
figure out what she is really up to.

78
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:23,470
Yes.

79
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:28,520
Second Miss.

80
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:34,930
"Second Miss"?

81
00:03:35,350 --> 00:03:37,690
You weren't like this

82
00:03:37,710 --> 00:03:39,320
when you begged me for help!

83
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,780
My Lady,

84
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,060
I'm so sorry.

85
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,670
After coming back from the charity hall,

86
00:03:47,670 --> 00:03:49,430
you've become different than before.

87
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,290
Are you hiding something from me?

88
00:03:51,470 --> 00:03:52,430
I wouldn't dare to do so.

89
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:53,440
Really?

90
00:03:53,470 --> 00:03:55,850
I don't think so.

91
00:03:55,870 --> 00:03:58,730
You just don't have the guts to take revenge, do you?

92
00:03:59,530 --> 00:04:00,280
Yes!

93
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:02,230
I dare not to seek revenge anymore.

94
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:04,210
That's because...

95
00:04:05,030 --> 00:04:06,790
Say it now! What's the reason?

96
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:10,310
Because Prince Yi is into the Eldest Miss.

97
00:04:10,990 --> 00:04:12,180
When she notices

98
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:14,710
that you're no longer eager to take revenge,

99
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,470
start talking about Prince Yi.

100
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:18,060
Prince Yi?

101
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,640
Just tell her...

102
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:23,580
Prince Yi and I met up in the charity hall in private.

103
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:26,230
We asked you to keep it secret, or we would kill you.

104
00:04:26,230 --> 00:04:27,790
Why would I say that?

105
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:31,560
Are you really in love with Prince Yi?

106
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:33,280
Are you seriously asking me that?

107
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:35,060
This is just a lie.

108
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:38,030
Tell her that Prince Yi is into me.

109
00:04:38,120 --> 00:04:40,000
Have her know that when I marry into the Duke's Mansion,

110
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,610
a lowly maid such as yourself

111
00:04:41,640 --> 00:04:43,530
will no longer get your revenge.

112
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:45,790
But...

113
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:47,450
Will the Second Miss believe it?

114
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,780
I don't care about that.

115
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:50,900
My goal is to make her think

116
00:04:50,930 --> 00:04:53,060
about the pros and cons of this matter.

117
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:55,800
That day, the Eldest Miss went to the charity hall

118
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,770
for a meetup with Prince Yi.

119
00:04:57,810 --> 00:04:59,400
When the people sent by you and Madam

120
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:00,400
started taking action,

121
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:02,930
Prince Yi's guards immediately killed them.

122
00:05:03,590 --> 00:05:04,710
What?

123
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:07,650
Bai Xiyao's secret lover is Prince Yi?

124
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,010
How dare you conceal something so important from me?

125
00:05:11,010 --> 00:05:13,120
Prince Yi has a guard named Tao Yu.

126
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:15,130
He is a brutal martial fighter.

127
00:05:15,150 --> 00:05:16,550
After he killed those people,

128
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,830
he asked me to

129
00:05:17,850 --> 00:05:19,460
keep my mouth shut,

130
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:20,650
or...

131
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:23,550
Or he would show up in my room on that very night.

132
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,750
I was truly scared.

133
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,510
I was afraid of getting killed.

134
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:29,680
When the Eldest Miss

135
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,390
marries into the Duke's Mansion,

136
00:05:31,390 --> 00:05:33,790
she'll be a powerful noble lady.

137
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:37,590
I'm just a lowly maid.

138
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:40,750
How am I supposed to avenge my brother?

139
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,680
Get up.

140
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,510
If what Lianxin said is true,

141
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,540
then Bai Xiyao and Prince Yi must long to marry each other.

142
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:53,100
They made excuses out of me

143
00:05:53,130 --> 00:05:55,080
only to cover for themselves.

144
00:05:55,210 --> 00:05:56,140
How despicable.

145
00:05:56,370 --> 00:05:58,300
They put me on the spot!

146
00:05:58,530 --> 00:06:01,230
I won't let this conniving couple have their way.

147
00:06:01,230 --> 00:06:02,040
My Lady,

148
00:06:02,070 --> 00:06:03,010
what should we

149
00:06:03,030 --> 00:06:04,330
do next?

150
00:06:08,910 --> 00:06:10,740
Times have changed.

151
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,780
I'm about to become a royal consort.

152
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,500
I'll be just as powerful as her.

153
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:18,110
After I take her to the palace,

154
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,930
I'll teach her a good lesson.

155
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,130
I await your instructions, My Lady.

156
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,400
Thank you.

157
00:06:37,420 --> 00:06:41,020
Why hasn't His Majesty appointed a new empress over these years?

158
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:45,100
Noble Consort Li's father is head of civil officials.

159
00:06:45,150 --> 00:06:46,580
My aunt is supported

160
00:06:46,600 --> 00:06:48,760
by Yun's Army and military officials.

161
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,520
His Majesty has been trying to strike a balance between them.

162
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:53,880
Now,

163
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,490
the border areas are at peace.

164
00:06:55,490 --> 00:06:58,270
It's time to reclaim military power and weaken the regional lords.

165
00:06:58,270 --> 00:06:59,070
Therefore,

166
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:02,160
His Majesty plans to make Noble Consort Li the Empress.

167
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:07,830
The Empress Dowager's hope is on His Majesty's sons.

168
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:11,470
She attempts to make one of the girls in the Bai family the future Empress.

169
00:07:11,470 --> 00:07:13,150
But if Pei Si ascends to the throne,

170
00:07:13,150 --> 00:07:15,360
then all her efforts will go down the drain.

171
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:16,490
Given that, the Empress Dowager

172
00:07:16,490 --> 00:07:18,100
won't agree to let Pei Si's mother,

173
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,630
namely Noble Consort Li, become the Empress.

174
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:20,600
Your sister

175
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:22,680
has been chosen to be a royal consort.

176
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:25,590
The friendly relationship maintained by those two women

177
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:26,800
will soon fall apart.

178
00:07:27,470 --> 00:07:30,190
Noble Consort Li can only rely on His Majesty love for her

179
00:07:30,190 --> 00:07:32,380
if she is to build a bright future for her son.

180
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:33,310
Your sister

181
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:35,760
will probably be a threat to her.

182
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:39,360
Noble Consort Li will blame the Empress Dowager for everything.

183
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:40,930
The palace is full of schemes.

184
00:07:40,930 --> 00:07:43,420
One misstep could lead to serious consequences.

185
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,920
I'm really worried about Xiyue.

186
00:07:44,920 --> 00:07:46,159
As far as I know,

187
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:48,750
your sister has made several attempts to jeopardize you.

188
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:50,880
Why do you still care so much about her?

189
00:07:52,270 --> 00:07:54,400
She just hates being an ordinary woman.

190
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,870
People have her believe that she should ask for more.

191
00:07:56,870 --> 00:07:58,870
That's why she sometimes does evil.

192
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,500
By "people,"

193
00:08:00,530 --> 00:08:02,730
you actually meant your father, right?

194
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,310
In his eyes, you and your sister

195
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:09,020
are just his weapons for power struggle.

196
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,460
That's not true.

197
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,770
He still loves me.

198
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:17,910
Both in the previous life

199
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,250
and in this one,

200
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,920
Dad has always loved Bai Xiyue.

201
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,330
Do you remember what happened on the day you fell into water?

202
00:08:33,230 --> 00:08:35,429
Your Highness, are you onto something?

203
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:37,770
I was the one who saved you.

204
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,919
At that time, I asked Tao Yu

205
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,480
to handle some thieves.

206
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,300
Unexpectedly,

207
00:08:45,640 --> 00:08:47,630
I saw you being pushed into water.

208
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,300
Where are you going, Your Highness?

209
00:08:55,790 --> 00:09:01,520
His Highness could be killed If the Emperor finds out that he is back to the capital city without permit.

210
00:09:04,440 --> 00:09:05,140
Wake up.

211
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:07,390
-I didn't know the girl I saved
-Wake up!

212
00:09:07,390 --> 00:09:08,890
was you, Bai Xiyao.

213
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,500
Hey, wake up!

214
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:21,900
We're in hiding. Leave now!

215
00:09:30,650 --> 00:09:32,160
I can't believe you saved me.

216
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:34,410
When I saw you again in the Bai Residence,

217
00:09:34,410 --> 00:09:36,910
I knew we were meant to be together.

218
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:42,400
I went to Wangxin Lake because of you.

219
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:45,750
Didn't you have someone send me the sachet and ask me for a meetup?

220
00:09:45,750 --> 00:09:46,590
Me?

221
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,480
At that time, I didn't

222
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,740
know you were Little Bai.

223
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:52,030
Besides,

224
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:54,070
I've always carried this sachet with me.

225
00:09:54,070 --> 00:09:55,870
It has never been anywhere else.

226
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:03,460
I had doubts about that too.

227
00:10:03,730 --> 00:10:04,900
I think the people

228
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:06,890
you caught could give us an answer.

229
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,270
You're as brilliant as ever.

230
00:10:11,170 --> 00:10:12,240
Madam Mei

231
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:14,510
hired them to abduct you.

232
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:18,000
The thugs in the charity hall were also working for her.

233
00:10:18,170 --> 00:10:19,450
They did what they did

234
00:10:19,470 --> 00:10:21,470
to ruin your reputation,

235
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:23,430
so you would lose your power at home

236
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:25,490
and couldn't marry Pei Yan anymore.

237
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,580
Madam Mei would do anything

238
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:29,080
for her daughter.

239
00:10:29,990 --> 00:10:31,940
But they don't see eye to eye.

240
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:33,860
They both sent people to hurt me.

241
00:10:34,030 --> 00:10:35,040
But the chaos

242
00:10:35,060 --> 00:10:37,120
actually gave me a chance to survive.

243
00:10:37,150 --> 00:10:38,280
But is Madam Mei

244
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:40,680
the only one behind all these conspiracies?

245
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,280
She got a job in the Imperial Kitchen for Xiang.

246
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:44,940
Could a concubine

247
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,520
have that much power?

248
00:10:47,030 --> 00:10:48,310
In my previous life,

249
00:10:48,340 --> 00:10:50,580
Mom would discuss anything with me.

250
00:10:50,860 --> 00:10:53,830
But how come I know nothing about these matters?

251
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,700
Are you saying

252
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:58,520
that my father has been giving her instructions?

253
00:10:58,550 --> 00:11:00,410
I've found out that your father Bai Wenli

254
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:02,390
actually works for Noble Consort Li.

255
00:11:02,390 --> 00:11:03,510
That is to say,

256
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:04,950
he has betrayed the Empress Dowager

257
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,940
and taken the Eldest Prince's side.

258
00:11:06,940 --> 00:11:09,510
Can you prove that he has betrayed the Empress Dowager

259
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:10,570
and the Bai family?

260
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:13,030
Do you remember Xiang

261
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:14,730
who worked in the Imperial Kitchen?

262
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:16,650
Your dad asked him to steal the Empress Dowager's medicine

263
00:11:16,650 --> 00:11:17,860
for your sister.

264
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:21,090
My charity hall saved Xiang's life.

265
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,100
So he told me the whole truth.

266
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:26,720
This way, please.

267
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:34,530
It must be my dad's idea to let

268
00:11:34,530 --> 00:11:36,260
Bai Xiyue drug the Eldest Prince,

269
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:38,490
because he thinks the Eldest Prince will ascend the throne.

270
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:40,540
He wants more power.

271
00:11:41,050 --> 00:11:41,850
It also proves

272
00:11:41,860 --> 00:11:44,050
that he no longer places his hope on Pei Yan and the Empress Dowager.

273
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:47,390
You're surprisingly perceptive about political struggle.

274
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:49,210
You don't seem sad or confused

275
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:51,030
about your family's betrayal

276
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,550
or the dark side of humanity.

277
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:55,200
Then how should I react?

278
00:11:55,510 --> 00:11:56,600
Cry and yell "no"?

279
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:57,490
Or should I deny what I saw

280
00:11:57,490 --> 00:11:58,750
and ask my family,

281
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,890
"why do you choose power over me"?

282
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,230
Do you expect to see me

283
00:12:02,230 --> 00:12:03,690
heartbroken and aimless?

284
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:12,430
I think I've found a way to communicate with you.

285
00:12:12,460 --> 00:12:14,810
I won't force you to fall in love with me.

286
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,060
But I think

287
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:17,820
you could make a good teammate.

288
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,790
You can achieve

289
00:12:19,810 --> 00:12:21,390
whatever you want with my power,

290
00:12:21,390 --> 00:12:22,780
don't you think?

291
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:23,970
Your power?

292
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:27,120
Aren't you

293
00:12:27,150 --> 00:12:29,120
just a greedy and incapable duke?

294
00:12:35,030 --> 00:12:35,870
Xiyao,

295
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,100
what brings you here?

296
00:12:41,430 --> 00:12:42,630
You may leave now.

297
00:12:42,830 --> 00:12:44,290
I don't need your service.

298
00:12:56,030 --> 00:12:57,760
Cousin Yan...

299
00:12:57,780 --> 00:12:59,520
Why is it you?

300
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:01,800
In and outside the capital city,

301
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:02,730
my guards

302
00:13:02,750 --> 00:13:03,450
and investigators

303
00:13:03,450 --> 00:13:04,650
are hidden in shops,

304
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:06,650
restaurants and charity halls.

305
00:13:06,680 --> 00:13:07,700
Most of them

306
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,590
are related

307
00:13:08,620 --> 00:13:11,290
to the soldiers of Yun's Army.

308
00:13:11,730 --> 00:13:12,830
I provide for them,

309
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,910
and they give me information in return.

310
00:13:14,910 --> 00:13:17,340
I've planted my people

311
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:19,820
in the imperial troops and every battalion.

312
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:21,600
Plus, I have Consort Xian's help.

313
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:23,290
if anything were to happen to me,

314
00:13:23,290 --> 00:13:24,660
the entire capital city

315
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:26,820
would be turned upside down.

316
00:13:27,090 --> 00:13:28,420
Now I understand why

317
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:31,190
Pei Yan was so determined to get Yun Yichen's seal in the previous life.

318
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:33,260
What overwhelming power Prince Yi has.

319
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:35,140
He can start a revolt if he wants.

320
00:13:35,910 --> 00:13:37,480
What do I need to do?

321
00:13:38,470 --> 00:13:39,720
Don't tell me

322
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,840
you're doing this

323
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,760
only to please me.

324
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,560
Isn't that a solid reason?

325
00:13:53,370 --> 00:13:54,900
There is an emergency.

326
00:13:54,990 --> 00:13:57,410
I have to do this for my sister's sake.

327
00:13:57,430 --> 00:13:59,430
I beg Your Highness's forgiveness.

328
00:13:59,810 --> 00:14:01,140
What happened to Xiyao?

329
00:14:02,550 --> 00:14:03,430
Since she found out

330
00:14:03,430 --> 00:14:05,690
that she was arranged to marry Prince Yi,

331
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,220
she has lost her appetite

332
00:14:07,240 --> 00:14:08,800
and looked all haggard.

333
00:14:08,830 --> 00:14:10,340
Recently, she has sold her dowry

334
00:14:10,340 --> 00:14:11,360
and attempted to run away.

335
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,470
Is she gone?
