[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,370
[Episode 4]

3
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:49,870
Your Highness,

4
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:51,200
we cannot accept this gift.

5
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:53,590
If people misunderstand

6
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:55,150
that you're proposing to my sister,

7
00:00:55,350 --> 00:00:56,370
who in the entire capital

8
00:00:56,390 --> 00:00:57,820
would dare to marry Xiyue?

9
00:00:57,990 --> 00:00:59,230
What nonsense are you talking about?

10
00:00:59,300 --> 00:01:00,800
Don't be disrespectful to His Highness.

11
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:01,730
Apologize now.

12
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,950
So this is what Miss Bai thinks.

13
00:01:07,270 --> 00:01:09,270
Then why can't your sister marry me?

14
00:01:09,580 --> 00:01:10,930
Forget it, Your Highness.

15
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,340
My sister is to marry into the royal family.

16
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:16,100
Marrying a prince

17
00:01:16,130 --> 00:01:18,520
would at most make her an idle consort.

18
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:20,900
Compared to my wife, the Duchess,

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,920
the difference is not just a little.

20
00:01:22,940 --> 00:01:25,020
My sister is to marry the Crown Prince.

21
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:26,789
She will be the future Empress.

22
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,160
How can a Duchess

23
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,820
compare to the queen of the harem?

24
00:01:31,130 --> 00:01:33,759
His Majesty has not yet designated an heir.

25
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:36,080
Miss Bai, how can you be certain

26
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:39,900
which prince will be appointed as the Crown Prince?

27
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:42,110
I...

28
00:01:45,979 --> 00:01:47,300
Please forgive her, Your Highness.

29
00:01:47,330 --> 00:01:49,020
She has been delirious

30
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:50,120
since falling ill

31
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:51,450
from drowning a few days ago.

32
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:52,410
Please do not

33
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,940
take her words to heart.

34
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:54,729
The words spoken today

35
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:55,890
must not be spread outside.

36
00:01:55,950 --> 00:01:57,680
It... it could cost us our heads!

37
00:01:57,870 --> 00:01:58,990
You...

38
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,170
have water in your brain?

39
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:02,420
Your brain is...

40
00:02:02,450 --> 00:02:03,220
Xiyao,

41
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:05,430
don't worry about me.

42
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:06,920
Please go back and rest.

43
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,300
Wait.

44
00:02:20,329 --> 00:02:22,480
This sachet is quite unique.

45
00:02:22,829 --> 00:02:24,000
Where did you get it?

46
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,020
Oh no.

47
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:28,820
Could Yun Yichen have recognized this sachet?

48
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:30,250
Your Highness flatters me.

49
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,320
It's just a trinket I bought casually.

50
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:36,510
Can one easily buy a sachet

51
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,010
with the Loong and Cloud Pattern of my Yun's Army outside?

52
00:02:44,860 --> 00:02:46,970
If Yun Yichen marries Bai Xiyao,

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,010
won't I be tortured to death by him?

54
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,840
Don't love me. It'll catch fire.

55
00:02:52,110 --> 00:02:53,310
I suppose

56
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:55,540
the embroiderer admires the Yun's Army

57
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,329
and imitated the Loong and Cloud Pattern.

58
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,480
If Yun Yichen discovers

59
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:02,330
that Bai Xiyao is Little Bai,

60
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,520
won't I be pestered by him?

61
00:03:08,170 --> 00:03:09,490
Let's get back to the point.

62
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:11,740
These modest gifts I've brought today

63
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,200
are to thank Miss Bai

64
00:03:13,230 --> 00:03:14,840
for her care of me in my childhood.

65
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:16,960
The reason I asked about her marital status

66
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,870
is to avoid any impropriety in giving these gifts.

67
00:03:22,750 --> 00:03:24,050
They're for me?

68
00:03:24,070 --> 00:03:24,550
Yes.

69
00:03:26,630 --> 00:03:27,390
Lord Bai,

70
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,780
it's getting late.

71
00:03:29,090 --> 00:03:30,090
I should return to my mansion now.

72
00:03:30,110 --> 00:03:30,910
I apologize for the intrusion.

73
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,350
No at all, Your Highness.

74
00:03:32,550 --> 00:03:33,280
Xiyue,

75
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:35,180
hurry up and thank His Highness.

76
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:38,300
Thank you for your generous gifts.

77
00:03:38,410 --> 00:03:39,510
It's such an honor.

78
00:03:40,370 --> 00:03:41,780
Please don't see me out, Lord Bai.

79
00:03:42,430 --> 00:03:43,829
See His Highness off.

80
00:03:47,310 --> 00:03:48,329
We

81
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:50,690
will meet again.

82
00:03:52,520 --> 00:03:53,829
Take care, Your Highness.

83
00:03:54,270 --> 00:03:55,520
Take care, Your Highness.

84
00:03:56,130 --> 00:03:57,230
No matter what,

85
00:03:57,260 --> 00:03:57,970
I must not let

86
00:03:57,990 --> 00:03:59,980
Yun Yichen's flame ignite.

87
00:04:00,580 --> 00:04:01,290
My Lord,

88
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:02,810
I thought you just

89
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,900
wanted to marry an official's daughter as a cover,

90
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:05,910
but I didn't expect you

91
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:07,490
to marry your childhood sweetheart.

92
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:08,410
What cover?

93
00:04:09,030 --> 00:04:10,160
The person I want to marry

94
00:04:10,190 --> 00:04:12,170
is someone I can trust completely.

95
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,140
It's just that there are still doubts about the identities of these two sisters.

96
00:04:15,260 --> 00:04:16,120
When do you plan to go to

97
00:04:16,149 --> 00:04:17,970
the palace to pay respects to Consort Xian?

98
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:21,339
Tomorrow, perhaps.

99
00:04:21,490 --> 00:04:22,510
I'm too tired today.

100
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:24,090
How could you not be tired?

101
00:04:24,110 --> 00:04:25,860
You've been traveling day and night to return to the capital,

102
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:27,210
going in and out twice,

103
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:28,670
rescuing people and giving gifts.

104
00:04:28,700 --> 00:04:31,500
Are you missing the rattan-whipped meat from the army?

105
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:33,170
Not at all.

106
00:04:36,090 --> 00:04:37,690
Not only is Bai Xiyao not dead,

107
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:39,360
but she's outperforming you in every way.

108
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:41,159
How can you be so relaxed?

109
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:45,330
I didn't expect that Xiyao, who usually pretends to be innocent and naive,

110
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:47,960
has been hiding her sharpness all along.

111
00:04:47,980 --> 00:04:49,550
What do you plan to do next?

112
00:04:49,570 --> 00:04:51,240
I will do everything I can to help you.

113
00:04:51,310 --> 00:04:52,260
No rush.

114
00:04:52,409 --> 00:04:54,460
I want to see just how sharp Bai Xiyao really is

115
00:04:54,490 --> 00:04:55,790
and what she's truly up to.

116
00:04:56,780 --> 00:04:58,260
It's a pity about Taozhi.

117
00:04:58,290 --> 00:04:59,060
You've lost

118
00:04:59,090 --> 00:05:01,120
a handy personal maid.

119
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:03,510
It doesn't matter.

120
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:05,600
I have someone even better.

121
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:09,980
Someone Bai Xiyao would never expect.

122
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:12,900
Can one easily buy a sachet

123
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:16,250
with the Loong and Cloud Pattern of my Yun's Army outside?

124
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:18,750
We

125
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:20,930
will meet again.

126
00:05:29,760 --> 00:05:31,610
My Lady, it's time for your medicine.

127
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,710
Since Yun Yichen hasn't proposed to Bai Xiyue,

128
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:37,810
let's deal with the immediate crisis first.

129
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:41,620
I don't dare drink the medicine you gave me.

130
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,000
Just leave it here. I'll drink it when it cools down.

131
00:05:44,030 --> 00:05:44,930
You can go ahead.

132
00:05:47,020 --> 00:05:49,159
My Lady, your body hasn't fully recovered yet.

133
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,450
Please don't overexert yourself.

134
00:05:50,810 --> 00:05:52,450
The Empress Dowager's birthday is in the middle of the month.

135
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:54,460
You still need to go to the palace to pay respects.

136
00:05:56,340 --> 00:05:57,540
The Empress Dowager

137
00:05:58,110 --> 00:05:59,300
wants to see me?

138
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:00,960
The Empress Dowager is most fond of you.

139
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:03,280
You used to accompany her all the time.

140
00:06:03,430 --> 00:06:04,460
Have you forgotten?

141
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:09,210
The Empress Dowager has always favored Bai Xiyao.

142
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:11,130
When I was still Bai Xiyue,

143
00:06:11,150 --> 00:06:13,190
I wasn't worthy of entering the palace as a concubine's daughter.

144
00:06:15,330 --> 00:06:17,520
One fire isn't out before another starts.

145
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:18,880
Just let me burn to death.

146
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,680
My Lady,

147
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,730
are you having a fever and feeling unwell?

148
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,010
I can't do it alone,

149
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,500
but isn't there still Bai Xiyue?

150
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:34,250
With the combined wisdom of both of us,

151
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,860
there's nothing we can't handle.

152
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:39,880
Lady Xiyao.

153
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,890
Xiyao, why are you here?

154
00:06:46,230 --> 00:06:47,790
I came to see you.

155
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:51,760
And I brought some of your favorite foods.

156
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,930
Indeed, these are all my favorites.

157
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:02,120
Lady Xiyue.

158
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:05,950
What a clever maid.

159
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,950
You certainly know how to protect yourself.

160
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:09,850
I wouldn't dare.

161
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:12,540
I was afraid of arousing Lady Xiyao's suspicion

162
00:07:12,650 --> 00:07:14,620
and causing you unnecessary trouble.

163
00:07:14,670 --> 00:07:17,110
Bai Xiyao rarely goes out.

164
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:19,690
It might be hard to find another opportunity

165
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,820
to act outside the mansion.

166
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:25,310
I think there's still a chance.

167
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:30,630
Bai Xiyao left the mansion once because of a sachet.

168
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:32,270
That means she must have

169
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:33,790
someone important in her heart.

170
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,770
When the time comes,

171
00:07:34,790 --> 00:07:36,300
they will surely contact each other again.

172
00:07:39,370 --> 00:07:41,190
I never expected this, sister.

173
00:07:41,380 --> 00:07:43,860
You really do have someone out there.

174
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:46,880
Keep a close eye on her

175
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:49,090
and report to me at any time.

176
00:07:49,610 --> 00:07:50,760
Yes, My Lady.

177
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,150
Wait.

178
00:07:53,350 --> 00:07:54,890
This is for Bai Xiyao?

179
00:07:54,920 --> 00:07:56,560
She specifically asked for these.

180
00:07:56,740 --> 00:07:58,080
Why would Bai Xiyao order

181
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:01,200
the peach blossom soup and snowflake pastries that I like?

182
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,440
Bai Xiyao has been secretly investigating me.

183
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,560
Is this a show of defiance against me?

184
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:09,160
What's wrong, Xiyue?

185
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:09,980
Go ahead and eat.

186
00:08:10,950 --> 00:08:11,780
Thank you, Xiyao.

187
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:14,700
I don't have much of an appetite right now.

188
00:08:17,020 --> 00:08:18,040
Why?

189
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:21,220
Afraid I've poisoned it?

190
00:08:22,760 --> 00:08:24,150
I'm not.

191
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:25,570
You're just joking.

192
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:35,450
Just eating snacks isn't very interesting.

193
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,360
How about

194
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:39,120
you play a game of Go with me?

195
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:42,610
My Go skills are poor.

196
00:08:42,710 --> 00:08:44,780
I'm afraid you'll laugh at me.

197
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:47,100
Bai Xiyao is nothing but a fool.

198
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,710
It's ridiculous for her to play Go with me.

199
00:08:49,740 --> 00:08:52,590
Then you take black and I'll take white.

200
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:55,700
Whoever wins gets to ask the other to fulfill one condition.

201
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:57,440
How about that?

202
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:59,620
I have few desires.

203
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,740
I don't know what to ask of you.

204
00:09:01,780 --> 00:09:03,610
I wish you were dead.

205
00:09:03,740 --> 00:09:04,860
If you were,

206
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:07,370
I could have everything you have.

207
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,230
If I win,

208
00:09:10,830 --> 00:09:12,940
you just need to agree to one condition from me.

209
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,020
What if you lose?

210
00:09:15,470 --> 00:09:17,700
Then I'll take you to the palace

211
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,670
for the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet.

212
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:26,270
In my last life, I never had the chance to enter the palace and meet the princes.

213
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,900
This life, I'll fulfill that wish for you.

214
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:31,020
After all, you are me.

215
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:34,100
Are you serious?

216
00:09:35,230 --> 00:09:36,030
I am.

217
00:09:37,070 --> 00:09:39,270
How come there's another sachet exactly

218
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:41,850
the same with the one that Little Bai embroidered?

219
00:09:43,370 --> 00:09:44,180
Please come in, sir.

220
00:09:44,200 --> 00:09:45,070
Be careful, miss.

221
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,260
Yichen.

222
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,630
Yichen.

223
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:49,400
There are many mosquitoes and poisonous miasma at the border.

224
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:50,990
I'm giving you this sachet.

225
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,550
I will definitely come back for you,

226
00:09:52,570 --> 00:09:54,060
Little Bai.

227
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:56,300
You must come back.

228
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,420
Tao Yu,

229
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,100
let me ask you.

230
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,450
are there

231
00:10:09,890 --> 00:10:12,790
really two identical leaves in this world?

232
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:15,570
Would someone who gives a sachet

233
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:17,930
as a gift keep an identical one for themselves?

234
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:19,120
Your Highness,

235
00:10:19,980 --> 00:10:22,180
if a girl gives a sachet to her beloved,

236
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,400
she would only make one to give away,

237
00:10:23,430 --> 00:10:24,620
thinking it's unique.

238
00:10:24,830 --> 00:10:26,160
Maybe you're mistaken.

239
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,860
But the fabric pattern and even

240
00:10:30,190 --> 00:10:32,060
the stitches of the two sachets are identical.

241
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:33,210
Why is that?

242
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:35,690
Perhaps she made a small sample first

243
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:37,220
and then a formal one to give away,

244
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:38,650
keeping the sample for herself.

245
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,590
This matter is really strange.

246
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:42,920
But if I can't

247
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:44,780
confirm who Little Bai is,

248
00:10:45,190 --> 00:10:47,220
I can't feel safe to propose.

249
00:10:47,420 --> 00:10:48,750
Bai Xiyue admitted it herself,

250
00:10:48,860 --> 00:10:50,330
but Bai Xiyao has the token.

251
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:54,230
It's confusing me as well.

252
00:10:55,610 --> 00:10:56,220
Go

253
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,240
and find out

254
00:10:57,260 --> 00:10:59,460
which one of them frequently visits the palace.

255
00:10:59,490 --> 00:11:00,160
Yes, sir.

256
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:06,120
How is this possible?

257
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:08,000
I practice Go diligently every day.

258
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,110
How can Bai Xiyao be so skilled?

259
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:12,230
You silly.

260
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:14,370
I've been playing Go for several years longer than you.

261
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:16,530
These moves of yours are all my leftovers.

262
00:11:18,650 --> 00:11:21,370
You want to be the Empress, right?

263
00:11:23,150 --> 00:11:26,000
It's okay. I won't count your move.

264
00:11:28,290 --> 00:11:30,150
Xiyao, please stop teasing me.

265
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,420
As a concubine's daughter,

266
00:11:32,690 --> 00:11:34,560
I just want to marry a good family

267
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,480
with the Bai family's reputation.

268
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,970
That would be more than enough for me.

269
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:40,020
I wouldn't dare to dream of being the Empress.

270
00:11:40,220 --> 00:11:42,480
Just chatting among sisters.

271
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:44,480
Who do you think

272
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:46,630
will seize the throne,

273
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:48,680
the eldest prince or the third prince?

274
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:50,460
The eldest is preferred over the youngest.

275
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,430
The eldest prince, Pei Si, is already participating in state affairs.

276
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:55,930
I suppose it won't be long

277
00:11:55,960 --> 00:11:57,130
before he's officially named Crown Prince.

278
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,420
The eldest prince was born to Noble Consort Li,

279
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,750
while the Third Prince is the legitimate son of the late Empress.

280
00:12:01,830 --> 00:12:03,600
He lost his mother at a young age,

281
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,030
but he's close to the Empress Dowager.

282
00:12:08,170 --> 00:12:10,170
If you want to be the Crown Princess,

283
00:12:12,870 --> 00:12:14,720
you must marry Pei Yan.

284
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,210
He will surely

285
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:21,970
ascend to the throne one day.

286
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,830
Xiyao, what do you mean by that?

287
00:12:26,850 --> 00:12:27,850
Work with me.

288
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,840
I'll help you marry Pei Yan.

289
00:12:32,890 --> 00:12:33,790
Xiyao,

290
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,210
you've changed.

291
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,190
Xiyue,

292
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:42,720
you've lost.

293
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,330
What do you want me to agree to?

294
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:50,660
Help me investigate Lianxin.

295
00:12:50,980 --> 00:12:52,890
Find out what grudge she has against me.

296
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:54,800
My Lady.

297
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,230
My Lady, are you alright?

298
00:12:56,250 --> 00:12:57,330
My Lady.

299
00:12:58,810 --> 00:13:00,440
My Lady, are you dead?

300
00:13:06,260 --> 00:13:07,450
I'm fine.

301
00:13:08,190 --> 00:13:09,520
Luckily I woke up early.

302
00:13:09,840 --> 00:13:11,000
Otherwise, this Lianxin

303
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,200
might have stepped on my face a few times.

304
00:13:17,690 --> 00:13:19,480
[Friend]

305
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:23,690
Bai Xiyao,

306
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,600
how many more karmic fires do you have for me to extinguish?

307
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,650
Do you harbor such a great grudge against Bai Xiyao?

308
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:33,480
It seems Bai Xiyao

309
00:13:33,500 --> 00:13:34,920
hasn't done anything good either.

310
00:13:39,330 --> 00:13:41,430
Why am I, Bai Xiyue, the only one being tested?

311
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:43,940
Xiyao,

312
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,830
what do you mean by that?

313
00:13:46,180 --> 00:13:48,810
Why do I have to investigate your maid?

314
00:13:48,830 --> 00:13:51,330
Alright, stop pretending.

315
00:13:52,050 --> 00:13:54,180
I know she's your person.

316
00:13:54,800 --> 00:13:56,260
There are some things

317
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,510
she would tell you,

318
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:00,790
but definitely wouldn't tell me.

319
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:02,120
Xiyao,

320
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:04,340
I don't know what you're talking about.

321
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,100
You knew I was going to

322
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,700
Wangxin Lake, didn't you?

323
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:13,370
In my previous life,

324
00:14:13,390 --> 00:14:14,870
Bai Xiyao's drowning incident

325
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:16,130
was planned by me.

326
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:17,130
Lady Xiyue,

327
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,750
Lady Xiyao said she wants to go to Wangxin Lake for sightseeing.

328
00:14:19,770 --> 00:14:20,630
Except for me,

329
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,650
she's not bringing any servants.

330
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,470
Is it really just for sightseeing?

331
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,070
I don't know.

332
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,350
When you arrive at Wangxin Lake tomorrow,

333
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:31,930
make sure she uses this handkerchief laced with the powder.

334
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,470
You want to

335
00:14:36,690 --> 00:14:38,120
poison Bai Xiyao?

336
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,290
If I wanted to poison her,

337
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:42,520
I could have done it 100 times in the mansion.

338
00:14:43,070 --> 00:14:44,800
As long as someone is involved,

339
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,840
it will eventually be discovered.

340
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,330
I'll feel most at ease

341
00:14:52,990 --> 00:14:54,700
if I deal with her myself.

342
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,830
In my previous life, I thought Lianxin

343
00:14:56,850 --> 00:14:58,580
was just a treacherous maid betraying me.

344
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,880
I didn't bother to find out

345
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:02,120
what grudge she had against Bai Xiyao.

346
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:06,070
My Lady, please wipe your sweat first.

347
00:15:09,210 --> 00:15:10,820
Go get some snacks from the carriage.

348
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,440
Come back in a quarter of an hour.

349
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:13,940
Yes, My Lady.

350
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:14,990
I'll be right back.

351
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:36,010
Xiyao,

352
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:39,030
I'll marry the Crown Prince for you.

353
00:15:41,550 --> 00:15:42,350
Lady Xiyue,

354
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,140
someone's coming from afar.

355
00:15:46,230 --> 00:15:47,360
Bai Xiyao can't swim.

356
00:15:47,380 --> 00:15:48,380
She will surely die.

357
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,290
Come with me so we won't be seen.

358
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:51,700
Come back in a quarter of an hour

359
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:53,370
and pretend to find she drowned.

360
00:15:54,170 --> 00:15:56,510
I don't know what Bai Xiyue is up to,

361
00:15:56,560 --> 00:15:58,960
but I know what I've done.

362
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,260
It doesn't matter if you don't admit it.

363
00:16:02,470 --> 00:16:04,700
Let's put the past aside.

364
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:07,030
You've lost to me now.

365
00:16:07,470 --> 00:16:09,580
As long as you help me with this,

366
00:16:11,090 --> 00:16:12,970
I can still take you into the palace.

367
00:16:14,970 --> 00:16:16,250
And then

368
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:18,170
you'll be able to see Pei Yan.
