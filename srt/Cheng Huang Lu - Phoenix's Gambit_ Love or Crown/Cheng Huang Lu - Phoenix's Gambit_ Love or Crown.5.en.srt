[Episode 5]

3
00:00:47,990 --> 00:00:49,650
Think it over,

4
00:00:49,670 --> 00:00:51,170
my dear sister.

5
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:55,990
Xiyao,

6
00:00:58,790 --> 00:01:00,490
she's just a servant.

7
00:01:00,920 --> 00:01:02,260
If you find her annoying,

8
00:01:02,750 --> 00:01:04,250
just kill her.

9
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,590
You don't understand.

10
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:07,590
In this life of mine,

11
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,070
I'm walking on thin ice.

12
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:21,750
News has come from the palace.

13
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,310
The Empress Dowager wants to see you.

14
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:25,550
Great-aunt wants to see me?

15
00:01:25,570 --> 00:01:26,510
When?

16
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:27,870
You should address her as "Her Majesty."

17
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,570
Don't be so disrespectful when you enter the palace.

18
00:01:29,990 --> 00:01:31,260
Enter the palace at dawn tomorrow.

19
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:33,330
I understand, Father.

20
00:01:34,670 --> 00:01:35,470
By the way,

21
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:37,140
remember to ask Her Majesty for mercy

22
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:38,039
so that your sister

23
00:01:38,070 --> 00:01:39,770
can also enter the palace to show her filial piety.

24
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,070
As the elder sister,

25
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,860
how can you be so inconsiderate of Xiyue?

26
00:01:44,920 --> 00:01:45,490
Yes.

27
00:01:45,509 --> 00:01:46,759
My birth mother died early,

28
00:01:46,780 --> 00:01:48,180
and Father favors his concubine.

29
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:50,440
So in the previous life, Bai Xiyao

30
00:01:50,470 --> 00:01:52,140
lived such a bitter life.

31
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,509
Father, please rest early.

32
00:01:54,539 --> 00:01:56,050
I will take my leave now.

33
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,860
If one day Father could repent,

34
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:01,690
I wonder if Bai Xiyao's soul

35
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:03,580
would be able to find peace.

36
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:13,600
Bai Xiyao went to the palace and hasn't returned yet.

37
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,830
My Lady, what do you

38
00:02:14,830 --> 00:02:15,730
want me to do?

39
00:02:15,970 --> 00:02:16,840
Come here.

40
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:23,579
Lower your head a bit.

41
00:02:31,570 --> 00:02:32,370
Don't move.

42
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,030
Eat it.

43
00:02:38,060 --> 00:02:40,660
Let's have a heart-to-heart talk between us.

44
00:02:41,050 --> 00:02:41,980
My Lady,

45
00:02:42,010 --> 00:02:43,490
I... I dare not.

46
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,500
Since you've shown your loyalty to me,

47
00:02:46,520 --> 00:02:47,960
you're my people now.

48
00:02:48,100 --> 00:02:49,780
I'd like to get to know you better.

49
00:02:49,900 --> 00:02:51,260
You don't need to be nervous.

50
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:52,760
Please ask, My Lady.

51
00:02:52,780 --> 00:02:54,740
I will answer truthfully.

52
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:58,400
Do you have any family?

53
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:00,190
Are your parents still alive?

54
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,710
Do you have any siblings?

55
00:03:03,940 --> 00:03:05,970
I've been an orphan since I was young,

56
00:03:06,130 --> 00:03:07,850
raised on the charity of others.

57
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:10,170
I was sold to the capital by a slave trader,

58
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:12,710
and entered the Bai mansion at six to serve you.

59
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,960
You've had a hard life too.

60
00:03:18,530 --> 00:03:19,670
Do you have

61
00:03:19,690 --> 00:03:21,470
anyone you're close to?

62
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,990
No one.

63
00:03:25,010 --> 00:03:26,420
What about Bai Xiyao?

64
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:28,000
What grudge do you hold against her?

65
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:31,820
She killed a mute boy 10 years ago,

66
00:03:33,079 --> 00:03:35,420
who was my only family, my brother.

67
00:03:42,070 --> 00:03:43,400
Tell me more.

68
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,190
That day, Lady Xiyao was distributing porridge in the dining hall.

69
00:03:48,380 --> 00:03:50,200
My brother wanted to get some porridge for us.

70
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:52,030
But he accidentally bumped into Lady Xiyao.

71
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:55,170
And she had her servants beat him to death.

72
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:59,750
So what you saw was

73
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:02,430
Bai Xiyao killing your brother.

74
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:08,790
[Cining Palace]

75
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:10,420
Greetings, Your Majesty.

76
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:12,740
Just call me Great-aunt.

77
00:04:12,770 --> 00:04:14,300
No need to be so formal.

78
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,740
The Empress Dowager indeed dotes on Bai Xiyao.

79
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,620
Xiyao,

80
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:20,420
come here.

81
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:21,450
Yes,

82
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,940
Great-aunt.

83
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:29,230
It's only been a few months.

84
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,080
You've grown up to be

85
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:32,990
even more beautiful,

86
00:04:34,409 --> 00:04:35,400
and seems

87
00:04:35,420 --> 00:04:37,570
more mature.

88
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:38,500
[Family]

89
00:04:39,780 --> 00:04:42,280
Why does the Empress Dowager also have a flame?

90
00:04:45,230 --> 00:04:46,360
Bai Xiyao,

91
00:04:46,550 --> 00:04:49,100
how many people and things do you regret?

92
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:50,560
Xiyao,

93
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:52,650
for this birthday banquet of mine,

94
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:55,220
I have something to tell you.

95
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,370
Your Majesty.

96
00:04:58,180 --> 00:04:59,780
I've come to pay my respects to you.

97
00:05:02,540 --> 00:05:03,490
Xiyao.

98
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:05,140
How improper.

99
00:05:05,250 --> 00:05:07,110
I haven't summoned you.

100
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:09,390
How dare you barge in?

101
00:05:09,420 --> 00:05:10,520
Please forgive me, Your Majesty.

102
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:12,430
I missed you too much.

103
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:13,900
Miss me?

104
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,760
I think

105
00:05:17,470 --> 00:05:20,470
you're here to see Xiyao, aren't you?

106
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:24,050
It's been a long time since I've seen her.

107
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:26,590
Your Highness.

108
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:28,180
Just call me Yan.

109
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:30,620
Xiyao knows the rules.

110
00:05:30,870 --> 00:05:32,640
Xiyao has come of age now,

111
00:05:32,830 --> 00:05:35,060
and should pay attention to etiquette.

112
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:37,140
Xiyao,

113
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,920
I see you've grown up now.

114
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,880
You should learn to handle some affairs.

115
00:05:42,170 --> 00:05:44,690
Next month, my birthday banquet

116
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:46,730
will be organized by you.

117
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:48,510
The Empress Dowager is paving the way

118
00:05:48,530 --> 00:05:50,280
for Bai Xiyao to enter the palace in the future.

119
00:05:50,790 --> 00:05:51,920
Then wouldn't it be

120
00:05:51,940 --> 00:05:54,130
even harder for Bai Xiyue to become Empress?

121
00:05:55,390 --> 00:05:56,190
Then I could

122
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:57,890
see Xiyao more often recently.

123
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,460
Yes, Your Majesty.

124
00:06:02,730 --> 00:06:05,260
In the last life, if there was anyone who loved Bai Xiyao the most,

125
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:07,820
it would be this Third Prince, Pei Yan.

126
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:10,350
Not long after Bai Xiyao married Yun Yichen,

127
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,000
Lianxin reported to me

128
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,750
that Pei Yan had caused a scene at the Duke's Mansion.

129
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:16,270
Xiyao.

130
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,050
Greetings, Your Highness.

131
00:06:21,410 --> 00:06:22,210
Your face.

132
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,460
Yun Yichen!

133
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:26,350
Is this how you treat

134
00:06:26,370 --> 00:06:27,900
your lawfully wedded wife?

135
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:29,750
Your Highness probably didn't hear

136
00:06:29,770 --> 00:06:32,450
about my assassination attempt on my wedding day.

137
00:06:32,659 --> 00:06:33,920
Assassination?

138
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,770
Why are you unharmed

139
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,240
while Xiyao is injured?

140
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:40,400
Cousin Yan,

141
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:42,100
don't blame my husband.

142
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:46,150
I was accidentally wounded by the assassin.

143
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:47,740
Who on earth did this?

144
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:48,710
I'll flay him alive

145
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,000
to atone for your injury.

146
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:51,800
I haven't

147
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,330
found out who did it.

148
00:06:53,940 --> 00:06:56,300
It's just that Your Highness is so concerned about Xiyao.

149
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:58,710
Why didn't you come to the wedding ceremony?

150
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:00,140
I was supposed to go,

151
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:03,200
but Father scolded me and confined me for seven days,

152
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,880
which is why I didn't make it.

153
00:07:04,900 --> 00:07:05,800
What a coincidence.

154
00:07:06,110 --> 00:07:08,850
You were confined on the very day of my wedding.

155
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,410
It was to prevent you from danger

156
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,860
that they didn't let you come.

157
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,560
What do you mean?

158
00:07:17,590 --> 00:07:18,990
I don't mean anything.

159
00:07:19,890 --> 00:07:21,990
Perhaps it's because of my poor character

160
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:24,530
that no royal family member showed up.

161
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:28,120
Father...

162
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:36,440
Your Highness,

163
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:38,390
I am already married.

164
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,860
There are still many matters to attend to at the Duke's Mansion.

165
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,560
Please leave, Your Highness.

166
00:07:43,290 --> 00:07:44,090
Xiyao,

167
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:46,490
I will send you the finest wound medicine

168
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:48,260
and scar-removing powder.

169
00:07:50,170 --> 00:07:51,370
If you need anything,

170
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:52,980
just send me a message.

171
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,870
Madam,

172
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,090
what are you doing?

173
00:08:10,300 --> 00:08:11,650
These are the ones you've been

174
00:08:11,670 --> 00:08:13,630
working on day and night for His Lordship.

175
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,680
Go check again

176
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,090
if there's anything left.

177
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:20,560
Burn them all.

178
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,100
They're useless now.

179
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,620
Madam,

180
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:25,660
why didn't you tell His Lordship

181
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,480
that his childhood friend is you?

182
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:29,190
And the sachet with the Loong and Cloud Pattern

183
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,760
was given to him by you.

184
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,130
A memory etched in his youth.

185
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:39,510
It was just when he was alone and helpless,

186
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:41,980
someone showed him kindness.

187
00:08:42,590 --> 00:08:44,430
Even if I were to tell him now,

188
00:08:44,460 --> 00:08:46,950
it would only make him feel ashamed and embarrassed.

189
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:48,840
To repay this kindness,

190
00:08:48,870 --> 00:08:50,360
he forces himself to be nice to me.

191
00:08:50,380 --> 00:08:51,860
How much of it is genuine?

192
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,550
What he wants now

193
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,880
is a partner who can harmonize with him,

194
00:08:57,130 --> 00:08:59,060
a spouse worthy of high society,

195
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:01,500
not someone like me,

196
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:03,020
a disgraced and ugly woman.

197
00:09:03,810 --> 00:09:05,020
Sometimes I wonder

198
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,130
if it's not that he can't find out the truth,

199
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:10,500
but that he wants

200
00:09:10,530 --> 00:09:13,850
to piece together the most beautiful parts,

201
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,830
even if they're wrong,

202
00:09:16,350 --> 00:09:18,260
so he doesn't have to pay any price.

203
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:20,720
How can one

204
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,320
not pay a price for their mistakes?

205
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:26,600
Lady Xiyao.

206
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:29,720
What did you call me?

207
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:32,660
My tongue slipped.

208
00:09:32,700 --> 00:09:34,200
I'll go check the room again,

209
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:35,930
see if there's anything left.

210
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:47,710
Cousin Yan,

211
00:09:47,850 --> 00:09:48,900
why are you here?

212
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,290
I'm here to take you away.

213
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:53,530
What nonsense are you talking about?

214
00:09:54,550 --> 00:09:56,520
I know you're not happy here.

215
00:09:57,420 --> 00:09:59,070
Pei Si has already been named Crown Prince.

216
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,020
I won't have an easy time either.

217
00:10:01,890 --> 00:10:02,790
Rather than this,

218
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,680
why don't we leave the capital

219
00:10:04,750 --> 00:10:05,420
and wander the world,

220
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:06,540
living carefree?

221
00:10:08,470 --> 00:10:09,360
Cousin Yan,

222
00:10:09,540 --> 00:10:10,490
all under heaven

223
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:11,820
is the emperor's land.

224
00:10:12,090 --> 00:10:13,630
Where can we escape to?

225
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:16,500
Besides,

226
00:10:16,970 --> 00:10:19,160
we grew up within these palace walls.

227
00:10:19,610 --> 00:10:22,040
How would we know the hardships of the outside world?

228
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:23,180
We

229
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,730
can go overseas,

230
00:10:25,020 --> 00:10:26,250
or to Fengrong.

231
00:10:26,290 --> 00:10:27,380
The gold and silver I've brought

232
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,290
is enough for us to live comfortably for a lifetime.

233
00:10:30,460 --> 00:10:31,420
Why?

234
00:10:32,950 --> 00:10:34,490
Why should I go with you?

235
00:10:36,550 --> 00:10:38,420
You can't bear to part with Yun Yichen?

236
00:10:39,110 --> 00:10:40,180
You love him?

237
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:43,850
What I felt for him

238
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:46,950
was just a youthful infatuation.

239
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:48,840
Now there's only disappointment,

240
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,330
no love left.

241
00:10:50,460 --> 00:10:51,450
What about me?

242
00:10:52,370 --> 00:10:53,880
Have you ever loved me?

243
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:56,100
I...

244
00:10:57,740 --> 00:11:00,240
I've always seen you as my elder brother.

245
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:06,920
Cousin Yan,

246
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:10,450
you're a person of great benevolence with a heart for the world.

247
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,430
You're the one who can shoulder

248
00:11:12,450 --> 00:11:14,090
the responsibility of Fengqi State.

249
00:11:14,930 --> 00:11:17,600
Her Majesty also has high expectations for you.

250
00:11:18,130 --> 00:11:20,100
You can't give up so easily.

251
00:11:22,690 --> 00:11:23,700
What about you?

252
00:11:24,910 --> 00:11:26,800
You could have married me!

253
00:11:27,430 --> 00:11:30,130
Her Majesty has been grooming me as the future Crown Prince since I was young.

254
00:11:30,210 --> 00:11:32,730
I've always thought you would be my Crown Princess.

255
00:11:33,580 --> 00:11:36,230
Now you're suffering at the hands of that bastard.

256
00:11:36,330 --> 00:11:38,230
What's the point of me becoming Crown Prince?

257
00:11:38,250 --> 00:11:39,790
What's the point of becoming Phoenix Emperor?

258
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:42,410
Without you to share my joy and glory,

259
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,910
how am I any different from a walking corpse?

260
00:11:48,070 --> 00:11:50,090
You will have consorts, an Empress,

261
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:52,070
and concubines

262
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,940
in the future,

263
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:57,500
all from noble families.

264
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,960
You'll forget about me then.

265
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:00,580
No.

266
00:12:01,190 --> 00:12:02,420
I just want you.

267
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:04,010
I just want you.

268
00:12:04,030 --> 00:12:05,400
No matter what others say about you,

269
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,000
you will always be my beloved Xiyao.

270
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,540
You should go.

271
00:12:13,180 --> 00:12:15,020
I won't leave with you.

272
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:19,290
Although this side courtyard is quite deserted,

273
00:12:19,310 --> 00:12:21,080
there's a chance the night patrol servants will see us.

274
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:23,550
And then I'll be the one to suffer.

275
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,990
What can you do for me then?

276
00:12:38,180 --> 00:12:39,590
I won't give up.

277
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,760
One day,

278
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,900
I will save you from this suffering.

279
00:13:01,790 --> 00:13:02,860
Cousin Yan,

280
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:06,690
I have failed you in this life.

281
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,290
When I passed this place in my previous life,

282
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,970
it was the Empress's coronation ceremony.

283
00:13:28,180 --> 00:13:30,310
Her Majesty is departing.

284
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:43,910
Who's there?

285
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:45,910
How dare you block Her Majesty!

286
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,490
Protect Her Majesty!

287
00:13:47,510 --> 00:13:48,860
Avenge Prince Yi!

288
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,690
Kill Bai Xiyue!

289
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,480
Kill Bai Xiyue!

290
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,270
Protect Her Majesty!

291
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:55,670
Protect Her Majesty!

292
00:14:04,190 --> 00:14:06,020
The Yun's Army fears no battle!

293
00:14:06,050 --> 00:14:07,250
Our spirits will never die!

294
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,190
Kill!

295
00:14:11,530 --> 00:14:12,800
Watch out!

296
00:14:13,020 --> 00:14:14,330
Protect Her Majesty!

297
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:52,910
Her Majesty is departing.

298
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:57,820
Lianxin,

299
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:01,170
it's a pity you won't make it to the Empress's coronation ceremony.

300
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:09,980
Lianxin,

301
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:12,020
I need to give you an explanation soon.

302
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,550
My Lady, you're back.

303
00:15:22,930 --> 00:15:24,530
I'll be going to the palace frequently lately.

304
00:15:24,550 --> 00:15:26,100
You can rest more when you're free.

305
00:15:27,590 --> 00:15:28,520
My Lady,

306
00:15:28,550 --> 00:15:30,320
shall I accompany you to the palace?

307
00:15:30,350 --> 00:15:32,580
I can do any dirty or tiring work for you.

308
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,240
The palace isn't a place to enter at will.

309
00:15:34,270 --> 00:15:36,430
Besides, there's no shortage of hands in the palace.

310
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:40,120
Bai Xiyue,

311
00:15:40,150 --> 00:15:41,820
it's time for you to fulfill your promise.

312
00:15:55,930 --> 00:15:56,730
Come here.

313
00:16:00,650 --> 00:16:01,550
Lower.

314
00:16:07,070 --> 00:16:08,070
Don't move!

315
00:16:08,430 --> 00:16:10,430
Yes, My Lady.

316
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:13,150
Try the temperature of this tea for me.

317
00:16:13,520 --> 00:16:14,740
If it feels hot,

318
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:16,410
you must tell me.
