[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

2
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:46,390
[Episode 8]

3
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:52,490
Madam.

4
00:00:57,340 --> 00:00:59,660
Madam, are you busy at the moment?

5
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:01,160
What's the matter?

6
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,190
I was hoping you could teach me how to write a letter.

7
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:06,160
Back at the Bai family,

8
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,900
didn't you learn to write with me?

9
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:09,930
The few characters I know

10
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:11,330
are fine for writing to a butcher,

11
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,400
but if I'm writing to an educated young master,

12
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,920
I'm afraid he'll think I'm too crude.

13
00:01:17,350 --> 00:01:18,960
It's for that Young Master Zhao, isn't it?

14
00:01:20,039 --> 00:01:21,830
How do you know everything, Madam?

15
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:28,060
That Young Master Zhao does seem like a good man.

16
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:30,120
Lianxin,

17
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:31,830
you've been with me for so long.

18
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:34,700
I sincerely hope you can marry into a good family,

19
00:01:35,620 --> 00:01:37,100
not like me,

20
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:38,820
wasting my life away.

21
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:43,160
Whether he'll like me or not

22
00:01:43,190 --> 00:01:44,880
still depends on your literary skills, Madam.

23
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:46,970
Alright,

24
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:48,160
I'll write it for you.

25
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,810
Then I'll teach you how to copy it.

26
00:01:49,830 --> 00:01:50,860
Thank you, Madam.

27
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:11,880
Lianxin,

28
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,060
the characters I've written,

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:15,330
you must burn them immediately after you've copied them,

30
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:17,750
to avoid trouble if someone discovers them.

31
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:20,020
Don't worry, Madam.

32
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,480
I'll handle it very carefully.

33
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:27,770
Madam,

34
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,290
what does this letter mean?

35
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:35,740
[Miss Lianxin, greetings through this letter. For many times, I have sat beneath the flowers, playing the flute.]

36
00:02:31,579 --> 00:02:31,579
[Though the red walls where she resides are within reach, they seem impossibly distant.]

37
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:37,450
He has intentions towards you.

38
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:38,770
He wants to find a matchmaker.

39
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,640
He wants to marry you.

40
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,829
Really?

41
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,950
Then...

42
00:02:42,970 --> 00:02:44,500
What should I do?

43
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,240
You have no family left.

44
00:02:49,420 --> 00:02:50,890
I'll make the decision for you.

45
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:52,970
When the time comes,

46
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,910
I'll not only give you a share of the land deed,

47
00:02:54,940 --> 00:02:57,130
but also prepare a generous dowry for you.

48
00:02:58,190 --> 00:02:59,680
Thank you, Madam, for your kindness.

49
00:02:59,990 --> 00:03:01,180
Please get up.

50
00:03:01,320 --> 00:03:02,700
We're like sisters.

51
00:03:02,730 --> 00:03:03,800
No need for such formalities.

52
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,430
Then, please, Madam,

53
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:10,550
set a date.

54
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:14,560
Well then,

55
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:18,470
at the hour of Wei on the 15nth day of this month,

56
00:03:19,829 --> 00:03:23,170
we shall meet and talk.

57
00:03:23,170 --> 00:03:23,960
[Meet and talk at the hour of Wei on the 15th day of this month.]

58
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:25,680
The letters written by Bai Xiyao

59
00:03:25,710 --> 00:03:27,060
were not destroyed,

60
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,460
but were kept together with Scholar Zhao's replies

61
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:31,030
and delivered to Yun Yichen.

62
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:33,300
You unfaithful harlot!

63
00:03:34,140 --> 00:03:35,870
My Lord, why did you hit me

64
00:03:35,930 --> 00:03:37,590
and insult my chastity?

65
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:38,829
Chastity?

66
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:42,420
From the day you married into the Duke's Mansion,

67
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:44,950
the entire Yun family lost its honor.

68
00:03:46,730 --> 00:03:48,660
Why do you degrade me like this?

69
00:03:49,510 --> 00:03:50,440
Degrade?

70
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:52,490
You've debased yourself,

71
00:03:52,570 --> 00:03:54,050
having an affair with an outsider.

72
00:03:59,130 --> 00:04:00,880
This wasn't written for me.

73
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:02,680
It was written for Lianxin.

74
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,600
Then what about these?

75
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:07,760
All these letters,

76
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:10,210
dare you say it's not your handwriting?

77
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,580
I'm most familiar with Xiyao's handwriting.

78
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,860
Indeed, it's not easy for others to imitate.

79
00:04:19,089 --> 00:04:20,149
It's not like that.

80
00:04:20,170 --> 00:04:21,130
Let me explain.

81
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:21,620
This is just...

82
00:04:21,649 --> 00:04:22,420
Explain what?

83
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:24,260
It's nothing more than seeking from others

84
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:26,240
what I cannot give you.

85
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:27,900
I didn't.

86
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:30,130
This really belongs to Lianxin.

87
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:31,420
It was written by her lover.

88
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:32,810
I just wrote it on her behalf.

89
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:34,820
Go and bring Lianxin here.

90
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:38,110
That maid of yours is probably afraid of being implicated by you.

91
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,659
She must have run away long ago.

92
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:42,760
Guards!

93
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:44,420
Tie her up in the woodshed.

94
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:45,760
Tomorrow, along with the divorce papers,

95
00:04:45,790 --> 00:04:48,090
let's escort her to the Minister of Rites' Mansion together.

96
00:04:49,330 --> 00:04:51,050
I'm innocent!

97
00:04:51,070 --> 00:04:52,940
I'm innocent!

98
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:54,980
Why don't you believe me?

99
00:04:55,010 --> 00:04:57,440
I'm innocent!

100
00:04:57,550 --> 00:05:00,200
Brother Yichen, don't let this upset you too much.

101
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:04,560
Xiyao has always been overly passionate.

102
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,500
She's been taught a lesson before,

103
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:08,250
and I thought she had learned from it,

104
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:11,660
but I never expected her to cause such trouble again.

105
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,590
Please don't shout, Madam.

106
00:05:28,620 --> 00:05:29,810
I'm here to rescue you.

107
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:34,130
Where is Lianxin?

108
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:35,750
Why weren't the letters destroyed?

109
00:05:35,780 --> 00:05:37,290
Why did she want to harm me?

110
00:05:37,310 --> 00:05:38,310
Lianxin

111
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,380
was severely beaten by them.

112
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:41,810
I'm afraid she doesn't have long to live.

113
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,230
How did this happen?

114
00:05:45,950 --> 00:05:47,490
Lianxin was grateful for your kindness.

115
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:48,840
She originally wanted to keep a memento.

116
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,330
She never imagined someone would want to harm you.

117
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,990
They snatched the letters from her hands.

118
00:05:52,010 --> 00:05:53,040
Lianxin refused to comply.

119
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,440
She was nearly beaten to death by them.

120
00:05:56,770 --> 00:05:58,050
Come with me to see my husband.

121
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,970
Explain it clearly for me.

122
00:05:59,000 --> 00:05:59,350
Clear my name.

123
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:00,180
Madam, you're being foolish.

124
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:02,380
If we go to see His Lordship together now,

125
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,330
not only will we fail to explain,

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,740
but it will confirm our affair.

127
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,920
Then what should we do?

128
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,650
Please come with me to save Lianxin, Madam.

129
00:06:09,670 --> 00:06:11,170
The only one who can prove your innocence now

130
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:12,350
is Lianxin.

131
00:06:12,380 --> 00:06:13,410
I'll stake my reputation on it.

132
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,980
I'm not afraid of their false accusations.

133
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:28,220
Madam has run off with someone.

134
00:06:28,300 --> 00:06:29,530
Catch them quickly!

135
00:06:29,530 --> 00:06:29,870
Madam.

136
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:30,660
Let's run!

137
00:06:32,620 --> 00:06:34,280
Xiyao is really being foolish.

138
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:36,350
How could she elope with her lover?

139
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,900
If this gets out,

140
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,750
the Duke of Zhen's Mansion and the Minister of Rites' Mansion

141
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,230
will lose face.

142
00:06:44,700 --> 00:06:45,540
Desperate times call for desperate measures.

143
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,530
I apologize for my rudeness.

144
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:47,870
Where exactly is Lianxin?

145
00:06:48,340 --> 00:06:49,440
She's right there.

146
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:55,960
Didn't you say Lianxin was locked up by them?

147
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:57,320
Why isn't the door locked?

148
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,380
And why is there no one guarding it?

149
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,950
When you go inside,

150
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:01,610
you'll know.

151
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,660
As expected of Luozhi Hall.

152
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:12,650
They've managed such a seamless substitution,

153
00:07:12,670 --> 00:07:15,660
making Bai Xiyao into a universally despised prostitute.

154
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:18,120
You flatter me, Miss Bai.

155
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:19,460
She has been locked up.

156
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:21,690
At your disposal.

157
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:28,440
Lianxin, you've done well this time.

158
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:30,790
It's time for your revenge.

159
00:07:32,420 --> 00:07:33,790
Thank you for your support, My Lady.

160
00:07:33,820 --> 00:07:36,380
Lianxin accompanied Bai Xiyao as part of her dowry to the Duke's Mansion

161
00:07:36,490 --> 00:07:39,310
not only to witness Bai Xiyao's daily torment,

162
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,490
but also to wait for the right moment

163
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:42,700
to push Bai Xiyao

164
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:44,380
completely into the abyss.

165
00:08:21,830 --> 00:08:23,090
Who are you?

166
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:24,460
Why did you tie me up?

167
00:08:27,530 --> 00:08:29,450
Are you Bai Xiyue?

168
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,679
Force water down her throat.

169
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,020
Yes.

170
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,260
So it is you.

171
00:08:35,850 --> 00:08:36,990
Bai Xiyue.

172
00:08:37,010 --> 00:08:39,220
You're the one who set me up.

173
00:08:46,670 --> 00:08:47,610
Give it to me.

174
00:08:47,630 --> 00:08:49,010
Hold her down.

175
00:08:50,510 --> 00:08:52,880
I'll finish her off with my own hands

176
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:55,940
and watch her slowly die from the poison.

177
00:08:59,460 --> 00:09:00,520
Xiyao,

178
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:02,240
for the sake of your sister's future,

179
00:09:02,260 --> 00:09:03,700
stop struggling.

180
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:07,590
Just die quietly.

181
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:17,360
You idiots, hurry up and chase after her!

182
00:09:17,370 --> 00:09:17,820
Yes.

183
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:18,590
Her eyes were blinded by poison.

184
00:09:18,590 --> 00:09:19,650
She won't get far.

185
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,950
Lianxin.

186
00:09:20,980 --> 00:09:22,800
What did I ever do to wrong you?

187
00:09:22,830 --> 00:09:24,630
Why would you betray me like this?

188
00:09:27,050 --> 00:09:28,290
Bai Xiyao.

189
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,370
You ordered the death of my beloved brother.

190
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:33,480
I stayed by your side

191
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:37,220
just to avenge him.

192
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:42,940
At least Lianxin's matter is finally settled.

193
00:09:43,450 --> 00:09:44,980
She won't be consumed by hatred

194
00:09:45,010 --> 00:09:46,580
and lose her life in the end.

195
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:49,670
I just don't know

196
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:51,460
what Bai Xiyue's next move will be.

197
00:09:52,270 --> 00:09:53,210
Even if I told her

198
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:54,620
that I am her future self,

199
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:56,540
determined to help her ascend to the Empress' throne,

200
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:58,050
she wouldn't believe me, would she?

201
00:10:01,340 --> 00:10:02,790
Xiyao, have you gone to sleep?

202
00:10:05,940 --> 00:10:07,630
Speak of the devil.

203
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:09,990
Not yet.

204
00:10:10,350 --> 00:10:11,220
Come in.

205
00:10:20,790 --> 00:10:22,190
Xiyue, what brings you here?

206
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,480
Xiyao,

207
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,690
you went to the charity hall today.

208
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:26,030
It must have been exhausting.

209
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,460
How could it not be?

210
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:29,710
It's nice to know you care.

211
00:10:29,730 --> 00:10:30,800
It warms my heart.

212
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,610
You're here to see if I'm dead, aren't you?

213
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:37,040
Let me give you a massage, Xiyao.

214
00:10:37,060 --> 00:10:38,020
It'll help you relax.

215
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:41,980
After suffering a few setbacks,

216
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,030
you've learned to be more humble now?

217
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,540
I never thought I'd get to enjoy your massage skills, Xiyue.

218
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:54,590
You used to be so distant with me before,

219
00:10:54,760 --> 00:10:57,550
otherwise I could have given you massages more often.

220
00:10:58,830 --> 00:11:00,600
I don't deserve such treatment.

221
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:02,460
Tell me, what's on your mind?

222
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:03,510
Recently,

223
00:11:03,550 --> 00:11:05,160
I've become quite proficient

224
00:11:05,190 --> 00:11:06,930
at playing the Praying to Immortals for Three Lifetimes.

225
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:09,840
I was hoping you could give me some more guidance.

226
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,180
I believe in your ability to learn quickly, Xiyue.

227
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,890
At the birthday banquet,

228
00:11:13,910 --> 00:11:15,540
you'll surely amaze everyone with your skills.

229
00:11:16,820 --> 00:11:18,310
Thank you for your support, Xiyao.

230
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,390
However...

231
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:23,790
Xiyue,

232
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:25,760
in the palace,

233
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:27,630
you must behave yourself.

234
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:30,390
The palace is different from our mansion.

235
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:33,160
There are many rules in the palace.

236
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:35,230
If you're not careful and make a mistake,

237
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:36,900
you could easily lose your life.

238
00:11:40,250 --> 00:11:41,780
I'll remember your teachings, Xiyao.

239
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:50,720
I, this fairy, came here to experience tribulations,

240
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:52,210
not to do hard labor.

241
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:53,970
I haven't even solved my own problems,

242
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,270
yet I'm running errands for others.

243
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:58,400
Cousin?

244
00:11:58,940 --> 00:11:59,720
Cousin.

245
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,070
Xiyao.

246
00:12:01,290 --> 00:12:02,280
Bai Xiyao.

247
00:12:05,090 --> 00:12:06,080
Xiyao.

248
00:12:06,110 --> 00:12:07,480
I heard you were in the palace,

249
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:10,030
but I haven't been able to find you these past few days.

250
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:12,760
Your Highness.

251
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:14,150
Just call me Yan.

252
00:12:14,580 --> 00:12:17,550
So Pei Yan was once so youthful and spirited.

253
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:18,540
Cousin Yan.

254
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:21,540
I wonder how he became that cunning ruler

255
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:23,360
with inscrutable imperial intentions.

256
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,640
I've been busy with the Empress Dowager's birthday banquet lately,

257
00:12:25,660 --> 00:12:27,400
so I've been moving around different departments frequently.

258
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,720
If there's anything you need help with,

259
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:29,910
just let me know.

260
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,780
Don't overwork yourself, alright?

261
00:12:32,040 --> 00:12:34,010
Serving my great-aunt, the Empress Dowager, is my duty.

262
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:35,370
It's part of my responsibilities.

263
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:37,630
However, there is one thing.

264
00:12:37,660 --> 00:12:39,350
Could I ask for your help, cousin?

265
00:12:39,490 --> 00:12:40,490
Go ahead and ask.

266
00:12:40,530 --> 00:12:42,670
My younger sister, Xiyue, has come of age,

267
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:44,730
and she would like to attend the birthday banquet to gain some experience.

268
00:12:45,140 --> 00:12:47,340
I wonder if you could arrange that?

269
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,590
She has no official status.

270
00:12:51,610 --> 00:12:53,980
Although she's distantly related,

271
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:55,260
she's still a daughter of a concubine.

272
00:12:55,280 --> 00:12:56,550
She can't be presented in public.

273
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,930
As long as one has talent,

274
00:13:00,580 --> 00:13:01,940
why distinguish between legitimate and illegitimate children?

275
00:13:04,930 --> 00:13:05,930
Cousin,

276
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:09,080
they say His Majesty

277
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,340
favors the Eldest Prince, who is born of a concubine.

278
00:13:12,030 --> 00:13:13,670
But the position of Crown Prince

279
00:13:13,690 --> 00:13:15,860
should be occupied by one with virtue.

280
00:13:15,890 --> 00:13:17,360
Otherwise, those who truly suffer

281
00:13:17,380 --> 00:13:18,970
are the common people of the realm.

282
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,810
Xi... Xiyao,

283
00:13:21,210 --> 00:13:21,880
You...

284
00:13:21,910 --> 00:13:23,240
You're so capable, cousin,

285
00:13:23,260 --> 00:13:24,790
You'll help me, won't you?

286
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:28,070
I need to go to the Imperial Kitchen now.

287
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:28,940
I won't chat with you any longer.

288
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:29,770
Goodbye, cousin.

289
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:34,200
Why has Xiyao

290
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,590
suddenly become distant from me?

291
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,390
This will make you gain weight.

292
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,970
Eat some more.

293
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:42,860
That's enough, that's enough.

294
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,400
I think you've lost weight.

295
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:46,550
Aunt.

296
00:13:48,510 --> 00:13:50,140
We haven't seen each other in ten years.

297
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,800
How do you know if I've gained or lost weight?

298
00:13:52,830 --> 00:13:55,490
You looked so good when you were chubby as a child.

299
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:58,680
You've endured a lot of hardship at the border these years.

300
00:13:58,910 --> 00:13:59,390
If my sister were still alive,

301
00:13:59,390 --> 00:14:00,730
[Yun Yichen's Aunt, Consort Xian]

302
00:14:00,730 --> 00:14:02,000
she would be so heartbroken.

303
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:02,780
Aunt,

304
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:03,390
look,

305
00:14:03,410 --> 00:14:05,360
I've been consistently practicing martial arts all these years.

306
00:14:05,380 --> 00:14:06,380
I'm in great shape.

307
00:14:12,490 --> 00:14:14,130
Now that you're in the capital,

308
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:15,250
with no military power

309
00:14:15,280 --> 00:14:16,510
and no real position,

310
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:17,390
in the future,

311
00:14:17,410 --> 00:14:19,250
who will get along with you?

312
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,430
Aunt,

313
00:14:21,450 --> 00:14:22,890
I still have you, don't I?

314
00:14:22,940 --> 00:14:24,590
I won't starve to death, will I?

315
00:14:35,190 --> 00:14:37,020
Your return to the capital after relinquishing your military power this time

316
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:38,780
is really unwise.

317
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:41,930
You know His Majesty wants to kill you to reduce your power.

318
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,280
Aunt,

319
00:14:44,830 --> 00:14:46,930
to make His Majesty completely let go of his suspicions,

320
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:48,830
I plan

321
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:50,670
to return to the capital and get married.

322
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,800
Get married?

323
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,500
Which girl do you want to marry?

324
00:14:55,340 --> 00:14:55,940
Hurry, hurry!

325
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:56,770
Set it up properly!

326
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:57,610
Steward Sun.

327
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,660
I've been running around all morning.

328
00:14:59,680 --> 00:15:01,610
Why hasn't my silver been approved yet?

329
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:03,830
Don't be impatient.

330
00:15:03,830 --> 00:15:04,700
Wait a little longer.

331
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:06,180
I've already sent someone

332
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:07,400
to expedite the verification of the amount.

333
00:15:07,430 --> 00:15:08,950
How can you still say such things...

334
00:15:09,980 --> 00:15:11,850
Miss Bai, what brings you here?

335
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:12,640
Prince Yi.

336
00:15:12,670 --> 00:15:13,800
Prince Yi, why are you here?

337
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:15,590
My aunt, Consort Xian, and I...

338
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:16,600
Also,

339
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,940
the Miscellaneous Silk Office doesn't recognize the list I sent.

340
00:15:19,140 --> 00:15:20,460
I can't do anything like this.

341
00:15:20,490 --> 00:15:21,660
What's going on here?

342
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,420
Miss Bai, you're new here.

343
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,260
You're not very familiar with the palace protocols.

344
00:15:25,390 --> 00:15:28,330
We usually follow the rules.

345
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:30,050
You're trying to make things difficult for me,

346
00:15:30,070 --> 00:15:31,680
so you can control me, right?

347
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:39,740
Prince Yi,

348
00:15:40,430 --> 00:15:43,870
as you can see, I hold no official position,

349
00:15:43,890 --> 00:15:46,610
and I'm not qualified to prepare this birthday banquet.

350
00:15:47,230 --> 00:15:48,880
Would you be a witness

351
00:15:48,910 --> 00:15:50,740
while I ask the Empress Dowager to relieve me of this duty?

352
00:15:50,770 --> 00:15:51,520
Miss Bai,

353
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:53,060
please don't underestimate yourself.

354
00:15:53,080 --> 00:15:55,870
Since this task was personally assigned by the Empress Dowager,

355
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:57,760
no matter how difficult it may be,

356
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,730
we must do our best to accomplish it.

357
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:04,770
Rather than doing a poor job and being criticized by my great-aunt, the Empress Dowager,

358
00:16:05,020 --> 00:16:06,990
I'd rather report directly to her

359
00:16:07,010 --> 00:16:08,780
that I lack the necessary skills and knowledge.

360
00:16:08,810 --> 00:16:10,080
I'm not up to such an important task.

361
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:12,130
It's not that I'm trying to shirk my responsibilities.

362
00:16:12,470 --> 00:16:13,640
Prince Yi.

363
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:17,260
What do you think?
