[Phoenix's Gambit: Love or Crown]

00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,350
[Episode 14]

3
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,600
I second the motion.

4
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:49,490
Your Majesty,

5
00:00:49,970 --> 00:00:51,840
the eldest daughter of the Bai family is elegant and virtuous,

6
00:00:52,060 --> 00:00:54,020
but I only know how to wield weapons.

7
00:00:54,550 --> 00:00:56,730
I fear I might disgrace Miss Xiyao.

8
00:00:57,290 --> 00:00:58,150
I have

9
00:00:58,220 --> 00:01:01,750
always greatly admired the second daughter of the Bai family,

10
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,960
and will marry no one but her.

11
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:05,790
Minister Bai,

12
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,710
what is your opinion?

13
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:11,480
Given my daughter Xiyue's status,

14
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,880
she would indeed be marrying above her station as Prince Yi's wife.

15
00:01:14,020 --> 00:01:16,020
I fear she is not blessed enough to handle it.

16
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:17,170
Lord Bai,

17
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:19,580
though Miss Xiyue

18
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,420
is nominally a concubine taken to ward off misfortune,

19
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:24,870
I will treat her with sincerity.

20
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:27,190
Once she bears me an heir,

21
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,570
with a child comes honor.

22
00:01:28,650 --> 00:01:30,670
I will immediately make her my official wife.

23
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,240
Your Highness may not know,

24
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,690
but the Bai family has an ancestral rule that no daughter shall ever become a concubine.

25
00:01:35,860 --> 00:01:37,390
If she marries under these terms,

26
00:01:37,420 --> 00:01:39,820
it may well offend the Empress Dowager.

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:40,900
Then,

28
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:43,500
if I bestow marriage and name Bai Xiyao

29
00:01:43,530 --> 00:01:47,130
as the official wife of Prince Yi,

30
00:01:47,470 --> 00:01:49,350
would that satisfy you, Minister Bai?

31
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:50,180
Lord Bai,

32
00:01:50,950 --> 00:01:53,350
I have long admired the second daughter of your family.

33
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:57,729
I beg you and His Majesty to grant this union.

34
00:02:00,100 --> 00:02:02,430
I thank Your Majesty for the grace.

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,900
Prince Yi,

36
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,450
apart from the Bai family's eldest daughter,

37
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:08,300
there is no noblewoman

38
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,320
in the capital

39
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,720
who matches your status.

40
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,900
His Majesty bestowing this marriage upon you

41
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:15,850
is also out of concern

42
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:20,170
that no one will inherit the Duke's title in the future.

43
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:21,480
I object!

44
00:02:22,010 --> 00:02:24,120
Shouldn't we ask Xiyao what she wants?

45
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,950
Why should her future be decided

46
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:27,780
by marrying someone she doesn't love?

47
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:29,710
I beg Your Majesty

48
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:30,810
to rescind this decree.

49
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:33,100
Insolence!

50
00:02:34,050 --> 00:02:36,730
Have you forgotten the decorum of a royal?

51
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:41,900
Marriage is not for you to decide on your own.

52
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:42,890
You...

53
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:46,540
You are confined to your quarters for seven days!

54
00:02:46,880 --> 00:02:47,770
-Your Majesty, please reconsider.
-Court is dismissed!

55
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:48,500
Father!

56
00:02:49,210 --> 00:02:51,230
The marriage will be arranged by the Eldest Prince,

57
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:52,700
and the wedding will take place on an auspicious date.

58
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:10,230
I will not marry.

59
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,290
I'd rather die than marry!

60
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:13,580
But it's an imperial marriage decree!

61
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,380
That Yun Yichen must be insane,

62
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:18,180
begging His Majesty for a marriage out of nowhere!

63
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,470
I really have nothing going on with Prince Yi.

64
00:03:22,500 --> 00:03:23,579
If you do marry him,

65
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:25,660
please don't let it affect our relationship.

66
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,740
Shut up!

67
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,300
Even if I marry Yun Yichen,

68
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,630
you will never win Pei Yan's heart.

69
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:29,940
You...

70
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:30,460
Enough!

71
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:32,700
What are you two fighting about?

72
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:33,720
Father,

73
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:35,340
why didn't you bring up the Empress Dowager

74
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:36,610
to refuse the marriage?

75
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,700
You think I'm a fool?

76
00:03:37,730 --> 00:03:38,770
Can't I see His Majesty is

77
00:03:38,800 --> 00:03:40,490
trying to sabotage the Bai family's alliance with the Third Prince?

78
00:03:40,520 --> 00:03:43,150
Yun Yichen will eventually be stripped of military power.

79
00:03:43,579 --> 00:03:44,400
By then,

80
00:03:44,590 --> 00:03:45,990
the Bai family may appear powerful,

81
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:47,370
but in reality, will have no influence.

82
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:48,940
The Empress Dowager has no one in court,

83
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:50,920
so she won't be able to support the Third Prince to the throne.

84
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:52,260
So in this life,

85
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:55,200
is Bai Xiyao destined to marry Yun Yichen again?

86
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,670
And Pei Yan,

87
00:03:56,690 --> 00:03:58,610
could he still be destined to become the Emperor?

88
00:03:59,010 --> 00:04:00,400
I mustn't panic just yet.

89
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:02,090
I must think of a way to break this game.

90
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:05,910
So, Father, you're buying time.

91
00:04:05,930 --> 00:04:07,750
Have you already planned a countermeasure?

92
00:04:08,710 --> 00:04:11,190
I cannot easily enter the palace to see the Empress Dowager these days.

93
00:04:11,210 --> 00:04:12,110
Xiyao,

94
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:13,680
find a reason to visit the palace,

95
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:16,230
and take Xiyue with you to greet the Empress Dowager.

96
00:04:23,980 --> 00:04:24,940
Miss Lianxin,

97
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:27,010
I had Tao Yu invite you here

98
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,030
because I wish to ask you something.

99
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:30,800
Your Lordship flatter me.

100
00:04:30,830 --> 00:04:31,800
If you have any questions,

101
00:04:31,820 --> 00:04:33,220
I will answer them truthfully.

102
00:04:36,610 --> 00:04:37,530
I

103
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,260
wish to propose marriage to Miss Bai Xiyao,

104
00:04:41,170 --> 00:04:43,620
But I don't know what she likes.

105
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,280
So could you tell me a bit

106
00:04:46,310 --> 00:04:47,710
so I can prepare a betrothal gift list

107
00:04:47,730 --> 00:04:48,909
that she will be pleased with?

108
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,830
Your Lordship,

109
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:52,830
I...

110
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,830
I'm afraid I must disappoint Your Lordship.

111
00:04:54,860 --> 00:04:56,340
Miss Lianxin, please rise.

112
00:04:56,570 --> 00:04:57,430
Lianxin,

113
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,570
what's the matter?

114
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,120
Just speak your mind.

115
00:05:00,470 --> 00:05:01,910
His Lordship will not blame you.

116
00:05:03,950 --> 00:05:05,640
My lady has treated me well.

117
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:08,770
It was I who wronged her in the past.

118
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:11,550
But now I wholeheartedly serve her.

119
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:15,650
Right now,  my lady does not wish to marry you.

120
00:05:16,690 --> 00:05:17,770
So...

121
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:20,470
So I cannot help you with this matter.

122
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:24,260
Have I done something

123
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:25,970
to make her dislike me,

124
00:05:25,990 --> 00:05:27,360
to the point she refuses to marry me?

125
00:05:30,820 --> 00:05:31,890
Miss Lianxin,

126
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:34,030
it's fine if you do not wish to answer.

127
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:37,190
Your Lordship,

128
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:40,110
my lady used to think of you constantly.

129
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,520
She often told me

130
00:05:41,550 --> 00:05:44,030
about your childhood together in the palace.

131
00:05:44,050 --> 00:05:46,550
She hoped you would return to the capital soon.

132
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:48,140
But ever since...

133
00:05:49,200 --> 00:05:50,280
Ever since what?

134
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,420
Ever since the day she fell into the water and was rescued,

135
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:55,080
her temperament has changed.

136
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:57,900
Since then, whenever she speaks of you, she looks displeased,

137
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,830
and even...

138
00:06:00,870 --> 00:06:02,390
Even frightened.

139
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,560
Who did she see that day when she nearly drowned?

140
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:08,800
My Lord,

141
00:06:08,900 --> 00:06:11,520
did you come into the city early just to come here?

142
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,130
When I was young,

143
00:06:14,150 --> 00:06:16,420
I often came here with my parents to enjoy the scenery.

144
00:06:17,870 --> 00:06:19,430
My father liked to fish,

145
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,700
my mother would make my favorite chilled cakes.

146
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,870
Since returning to the capital,

147
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,690
I've been under constant watch.

148
00:06:28,250 --> 00:06:30,600
So I wanted to come here

149
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,770
to find a little peace.

150
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:34,220
This place isn't all that peaceful.

151
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:35,000
My Lord,

152
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:35,710
look.

153
00:06:36,159 --> 00:06:37,520
There are two people over there.

154
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:45,620
They don't look like good people.

155
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:46,280
My Lord.

156
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:48,680
Capture those two.

157
00:06:48,710 --> 00:06:49,570
Keep it quiet.

158
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,430
Don't make a scene.

159
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:51,560
Just watch me.

160
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:06,350
That day I was in a hurry to save her

161
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:08,250
and didn't see clearly who tried to harm her.

162
00:07:08,300 --> 00:07:11,040
So later she refused to acknowledge me,

163
00:07:11,060 --> 00:07:12,710
and even had her sister take her place?

164
00:07:15,180 --> 00:07:16,110
Your Lordship,

165
00:07:16,290 --> 00:07:17,820
you have been kind to our siblings.

166
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:19,610
I should not be saying this.

167
00:07:19,630 --> 00:07:21,430
But I must take the risk.

168
00:07:22,580 --> 00:07:24,140
That day, my lady

169
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,780
was likely going to meet someone she held dear.

170
00:07:27,390 --> 00:07:28,230
What?

171
00:07:29,060 --> 00:07:30,520
So I ask Your Lordship

172
00:07:30,540 --> 00:07:32,110
not to make things difficult for her.

173
00:07:35,110 --> 00:07:36,540
Childhood bonds

174
00:07:37,530 --> 00:07:40,040
can never withstand

175
00:07:40,630 --> 00:07:41,830
the test of time and change.

176
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:44,790
When we met again,

177
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:46,690
I saw she still wore that sachet.

178
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,670
Turns out,  it was all just my wishful thinking.

179
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:50,970
The sachet?

180
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:53,460
The sachet is from the person who asked her

181
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:54,560
to meet at Wangxin Lake.

182
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:56,890
She didn't always carry it.

183
00:07:57,290 --> 00:07:58,090
Lianxin,

184
00:07:58,110 --> 00:07:58,920
please stop

185
00:07:58,950 --> 00:08:00,410
twisting the knife in His Lordship's heart.

186
00:08:01,640 --> 00:08:02,990
The sachet she gave me years ago

187
00:08:03,020 --> 00:08:04,150
has always been with me.

188
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:06,530
Someone else used my name

189
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:07,930
to lure her to Wangxin Lake.

190
00:08:09,110 --> 00:08:10,490
I saved her by chance,

191
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,290
but I didn't know she was Little Bai.

192
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:15,330
What do you think?

193
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:17,760
But why did she change so drastically in mood?

194
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,180
Miss Lianxin,

195
00:08:21,630 --> 00:08:22,530
I will clarify

196
00:08:22,670 --> 00:08:25,350
some things in person with your lady.

197
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:28,010
If I've caused her distress,

198
00:08:28,150 --> 00:08:29,850
I will do all I can to make amends.

199
00:08:31,290 --> 00:08:33,450
Your Lordship is a virtuous and upright gentleman.

200
00:08:33,480 --> 00:08:35,049
I have been disrespectful before.

201
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:36,580
Please forgive me, Your Lordship.

202
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,150
Where is Xiyao now?

203
00:08:39,380 --> 00:08:40,679
Your Lordship,

204
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,880
the young lady went to the palace today to see the Empress Dowager.

205
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:44,230
She also took Lady Xiyue with her.

206
00:08:45,560 --> 00:08:47,510
[Cining Hall]

207
00:08:47,510 --> 00:08:49,320
When we meet the Empress Dowager later,

208
00:08:49,540 --> 00:08:50,990
aside from asking her to help me

209
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:52,910
annul the engagement with Yun Yichen,

210
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:56,500
it'd be best if she agrees to your marriage with Pei Yan.

211
00:08:57,610 --> 00:08:59,320
Xiyao, what do you mean by this?

212
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:01,070
The Empress Dowager

213
00:09:01,090 --> 00:09:03,200
favors your marriage with Pei Yan.

214
00:09:04,450 --> 00:09:05,880
What qualifications do I have?

215
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:07,560
I have my own way.

216
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:08,990
I'll make sure you marry Pei Yan

217
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:09,980
and become the princess consort.

218
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,160
That way, in the future,

219
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:13,790
the Bai family can produce an empress.

220
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,390
Why are you helping me so much, Xiyao?

221
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:20,440
Clearly, you're the most likely candidate to become empress.

222
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:22,280
I don't want to be any princess consort,

223
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,960
let alone an empress.

224
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:27,940
I'll do everything in my power to help you rise to the top.

225
00:09:30,280 --> 00:09:32,830
The Empress Dowager arrives.

226
00:09:44,390 --> 00:09:45,510
I have something

227
00:09:45,540 --> 00:09:47,140
to ask of you, Great-aunt.

228
00:09:47,230 --> 00:09:51,770
Xiyao, are you here to talk about your engagement with Prince Yi?

229
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:54,300
Great-aunt, you know me.

230
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:56,080
Don't worry, Xiyao.

231
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:00,770
I will issue a decree for you to stay in the palace.

232
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:02,910
If I don't let you go,

233
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,080
no one can marry you away.

234
00:10:05,390 --> 00:10:08,320
Once Yan ascends to the position of Crown Prince,

235
00:10:08,510 --> 00:10:10,010
I'll announce

236
00:10:10,270 --> 00:10:14,040
that you and Yan have already secretly pledged yourselves in the palace.

237
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:15,880
By then,

238
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:17,710
a mere Prince Yi

239
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:21,720
wouldn't dare snatch you from the Crown Prince.

240
00:10:21,870 --> 00:10:22,890
Bai Xiyao,

241
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,830
what exactly are you scheming?

242
00:10:25,190 --> 00:10:27,490
Are you deceiving me with false compliance?

243
00:10:29,670 --> 00:10:31,580
I wish to become a nun,

244
00:10:31,820 --> 00:10:33,080
to never marry,

245
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:34,800
and to serve by your side.

246
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,860
What nonsense are you spouting?

247
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:38,490
As for the engagement with my cousin,

248
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:40,010
let Xiyue take it instead.

249
00:10:41,770 --> 00:10:43,230
Please grant this, Great-aunt.

250
00:10:43,250 --> 00:10:43,970
You...

251
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,880
What nonsense are you saying?

252
00:10:45,900 --> 00:10:47,770
A few days ago, I fell into the water.

253
00:10:48,190 --> 00:10:49,310
At the brink of life and death,

254
00:10:49,330 --> 00:10:50,920
I've already seen through worldly affairs.

255
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,270
There's no room for romantic love in my heart anymore.

256
00:10:53,430 --> 00:10:54,160
Only

257
00:10:54,190 --> 00:10:55,930
my filial devotion to Your Majesty remains.

258
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,500
That's why I make this request.

259
00:10:57,520 --> 00:10:58,690
Xiyao,

260
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:02,900
have you forgotten how I raised you since childhood?

261
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,790
Have you forgotten Yan's affection for you?

262
00:11:05,900 --> 00:11:09,120
You're throwing away your own future!

263
00:11:09,210 --> 00:11:11,990
My relationship with the Third Prince is merely that of siblings.

264
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,090
There's not a hint of romantic affection.

265
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,840
I won't marry Yun Yichen,

266
00:11:15,870 --> 00:11:17,610
nor will I marry the Third Prince.

267
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:18,660
Silence!

268
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:21,700
You've disappointed me too much.

269
00:11:22,660 --> 00:11:25,490
You're unworthy of being a daughter of the Bai family.

270
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:29,620
His Majesty arrives.

271
00:11:33,170 --> 00:11:34,570
Greetings, Your Majesty.

272
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,620
Greetings, Empress Dowager.

273
00:11:40,030 --> 00:11:41,590
You may all leave now.

274
00:11:42,090 --> 00:11:43,060
It's fine.

275
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,490
They're not outsiders.

276
00:11:46,900 --> 00:11:48,800
Emperor, why have you come?

277
00:11:48,860 --> 00:11:51,400
The position of Empress has long been vacant.

278
00:11:51,430 --> 00:11:54,130
It's time to select someone to oversee the imperial harem.

279
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:57,220
I intend to appoint Noble Consort Li as Empress.

280
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,040
Empress Dowager, what do you think?

281
00:12:00,060 --> 00:12:01,420
In terms of seniority,

282
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:04,560
Noble Consort Xian is the niece of the Duke of Open.

283
00:12:04,580 --> 00:12:08,120
Though Noble Consort Li enjoys Your Majesty's favor,

284
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:11,920
she still lacks the necessary qualifications.

285
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:14,620
The Yun family is unworthy of the honor of Empress.

286
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:17,340
Noble Consort Li is virtuous and gentle.

287
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,330
She has also borne me the eldest prince.

288
00:12:21,210 --> 00:12:23,140
I've long owed her the position of Empress.

289
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:25,510
Rather than discussing the selection of Empress,

290
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,810
Your Majesty,

291
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:29,680
it's more urgent to appoint a Crown Prince

292
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:33,030
to put the ministers at ease.

293
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:36,100
The Crown Prince's position concerns the stability of the court.

294
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,700
There's no need for you to worry.

295
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:40,190
I wish to appoint an Empress

296
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:42,530
precisely to share your burden, Empress Dowager.

297
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:46,350
I can still manage the harem affairs.

298
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:50,730
Your Majesty should focus on appointing the Crown Prince.

299
00:12:55,970 --> 00:12:56,840
Guards, quickly!

300
00:12:56,870 --> 00:12:57,830
Protect His Majesty!

301
00:12:58,270 --> 00:13:00,730
Protect His Majesty!

302
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,350
I'm fine.

303
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:08,980
Your Majesty, forgive me.

304
00:13:10,010 --> 00:13:11,160
Careful!

305
00:13:16,340 --> 00:13:19,170
I just sprained my ankle.

306
00:13:22,780 --> 00:13:23,820
I'm fine.

307
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:25,070
Capture the assassin!

308
00:13:30,180 --> 00:13:32,640
You have such loyalty.

309
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:36,080
Escort Miss Xiyue to the Imperial Hospital for treatment.

310
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:36,930
Yes.

311
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:40,560
Something's not right.

312
00:13:40,590 --> 00:13:41,080
Something's not right.

313
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:43,950
This Bai Xiyue is definitely up to something.

314
00:13:48,770 --> 00:13:49,740
Eldest Brother,

315
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:50,960
what are you doing?

316
00:13:51,490 --> 00:13:53,290
An assassin infiltrated the palace today.

317
00:13:53,310 --> 00:13:56,280
I've been ordered by His Majesty to inspect every hall.

318
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,020
I've been confined to my residence these days.

319
00:13:58,340 --> 00:13:59,370
Forget assassins,

320
00:13:59,780 --> 00:14:01,520
I haven't even seen a stranger.

321
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:03,720
I'm just following protocol.

322
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:06,620
If I don't search carefully,

323
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:09,830
how can I know whether the assassin fled

324
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:13,370
or returned to their master?

325
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,960
If the assassin didn't flee the palace immediately,

326
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,360
why would they come all the way to my residence?

327
00:14:20,190 --> 00:14:21,270
Eldest Brother, your words

328
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,610
seem to carry another meaning.

329
00:14:23,990 --> 00:14:25,490
There's no other meaning.

330
00:14:26,590 --> 00:14:27,450
Third Brother,

331
00:14:27,900 --> 00:14:29,860
don't make things difficult for me.

332
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,960
I fear His Majesty will reprimand me

333
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:34,060
for not being thorough enough.

334
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:36,990
Eldest Brother, you may search as you please,

335
00:14:38,010 --> 00:14:39,540
but release my people first.

336
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:40,740
Search carefully!

337
00:14:40,770 --> 00:14:41,370
Yes.

338
00:14:54,260 --> 00:14:55,030
[Spirit Tablet of the Virtuous and Benevolent Empress Wen]

339
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:57,520
Take your filthy hands off!

340
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:03,070
Third Brother, why so agitated?

341
00:15:03,270 --> 00:15:06,820
Are you hiding something out of guilt?

342
00:15:06,950 --> 00:15:08,640
Pei Si, don't go too far!

343
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,230
How many heads do you have

344
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,600
to dare disrespect the Empress's spirit tablet?

345
00:15:13,010 --> 00:15:13,970
Empress?

346
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,080
Who's ever seen her?

347
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,570
Using a dead woman's title to scare people?

348
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:19,650
Pei Si,

349
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,640
you're courting death!

350
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,200
Seize him!

351
00:15:23,220 --> 00:15:24,140
Pei Si,

352
00:15:24,760 --> 00:15:25,230
you...

353
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:27,170
Let my Third Brother vent his anger.

354
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,190
Pei Si,

355
00:15:34,220 --> 00:15:36,440
you rely on the imperial troops being your maternal clan's power

356
00:15:36,470 --> 00:15:38,640
to disrespect the late Empress's spirit tablet.

357
00:15:38,860 --> 00:15:40,480
I'll report to His Majesty

358
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,060
and accuse you of arrogance and tyranny!

359
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:46,950
Third Brother,

360
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,930
why haven't you learned to assess the situation?

361
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:54,910
Bai Xiyao has already married Prince Yi.

362
00:15:56,170 --> 00:15:58,480
If you don't marry into the Bai family,

363
00:15:59,030 --> 00:16:00,910
will the Empress Dowager still support you?

364
00:16:01,100 --> 00:16:03,100
You've lost everything now.

365
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:06,310
What do you have left to compete for the Crown Prince's position?

366
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:08,100
I am, after all, the legitimate son of the Empress.

367
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,990
If His Majesty learns of your lack of virtue,

368
00:16:10,020 --> 00:16:12,010
he won't pass the throne to you.

369
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:17,960
Pei Si, what are you doing?

370
00:16:17,990 --> 00:16:18,800
