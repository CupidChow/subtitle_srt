00:00:43,810 --> 00:00:46,360
[Episode 11]

3
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,560
Dear cousin... A toast to you.

4
00:01:04,030 --> 00:01:05,170
Xiyue,

5
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:06,110
what's wrong?

6
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:07,040
Are you alright?

7
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:08,580
I'm fine.

8
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,830
This wine...

9
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,420
is quite strong.

10
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:13,640
Miss Bai,

11
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:16,440
Prince Yan has ordered me to escort you out of the palace.

12
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:19,420
My head is spinning.

13
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:21,690
Miss Bai?

14
00:01:21,710 --> 00:01:22,789
Miss Bai.

15
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:25,570
If you speak carelessly

16
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:27,140
and displease Prince Si,

17
00:01:27,170 --> 00:01:28,500
watch out for your miserable life!

18
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:32,430
You're much more alluring

19
00:01:32,729 --> 00:01:34,750
than that girl, Xiyao.

20
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:37,750
Cousin Si,

21
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,979
what are you doing?

22
00:01:39,020 --> 00:01:40,050
Let go of me.

23
00:01:40,080 --> 00:01:40,979
Xiyue,

24
00:01:41,030 --> 00:01:42,450
I like you.

25
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:44,580
When I become the Crown Prince,

26
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:46,759
I'll make you my Crown Princess.

27
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:48,420
Cousin Si,

28
00:01:48,440 --> 00:01:49,610
please don't.

29
00:01:49,780 --> 00:01:51,850
This is improper.

30
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,460
I am Father's eldest son.

31
00:01:53,490 --> 00:01:55,670
In the future, I'll define what is proper in this world.

32
00:01:55,890 --> 00:01:57,550
Only by being with me

33
00:01:57,580 --> 00:02:00,160
can you change your fate as a concubine's daughter.

34
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:01,820
Cousin Si...

35
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:05,360
You'd really marry me as your wife?

36
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:06,250
Xiyue,

37
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,419
whatever you want,

38
00:02:08,650 --> 00:02:10,380
I will give it to you.

39
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:14,970
The bright moon shines through my window;

40
00:02:15,250 --> 00:02:17,000
The Milky Way flows eastward...

41
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:18,900
and the night is not yet over.

42
00:02:19,170 --> 00:02:22,200
Where are those who once appreciated the moon with me?

43
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:25,400
The scene ahead of me... seems just like last year.

44
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Longing for you beneath the waning moon on an autumn night;

45
00:02:28,280 --> 00:02:29,880
I stroll by the lotus pond...

46
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:31,400
singing to the cool night sky!

47
00:02:31,620 --> 00:02:33,700
As water is scooped, the moon rests in delicate hands;

48
00:02:33,770 --> 00:02:35,130
While toying with flowers, fragrance lingers

49
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,400
on brocaded robes.

50
00:02:36,430 --> 00:02:38,829
In the southern lands, the moon chills the thousand mountains;

51
00:02:39,010 --> 00:02:40,430
the war is over...

52
00:02:41,329 --> 00:02:42,350
yet none return.

53
00:02:45,850 --> 00:02:47,150
I fear the wine is taking hold.

54
00:02:47,710 --> 00:02:48,900
Perhaps...

55
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,420
we should call it a night.

56
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:53,360
How boring.

57
00:02:53,950 --> 00:02:55,329
Then, let us rise

58
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:56,770
and share a proper toast.

59
00:03:04,470 --> 00:03:05,310
Xiyue.

60
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:07,730
Come on.

61
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:10,160
Let me pour you a drink.

62
00:03:11,140 --> 00:03:12,990
It's better if I pour it myself.

63
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:15,700
You didn't do it yourself in your previous life.

64
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,400
Alright, Xiyue.

65
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:20,740
Don't be sad anymore

66
00:03:20,829 --> 00:03:21,860
for that indecent woman.

67
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,910
Let me stop her first.

68
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:26,700
Cheers.

69
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:28,250
Xiyue can't hold her liquor.

70
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:29,280
I'll drink...

71
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:30,910
this one for her.

72
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,329
Xiyao,

73
00:03:34,630 --> 00:03:35,800
I can handle it.

74
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:37,030
Have you forgotten what I told you

75
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,440
before we entered the palace?

76
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:41,840
I'll do everything you say, Xiyao.

77
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:42,930
Xiyao,

78
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:44,220
you're being too overbearing.

79
00:03:44,570 --> 00:03:46,490
We're all brothers to you.

80
00:03:46,510 --> 00:03:47,360
Don't tell me

81
00:03:47,380 --> 00:03:48,180
you are still worried

82
00:03:48,210 --> 00:03:49,940
that we can't take care of Xiyue.

83
00:03:49,970 --> 00:03:50,770
What?

84
00:03:51,070 --> 00:03:52,150
Cousin Si,

85
00:03:52,170 --> 00:03:54,200
are you implying I'm not worthy of sharing a drink with you?

86
00:03:56,550 --> 00:03:57,790
You two should stop drinking.

87
00:03:58,340 --> 00:03:59,140
Brother.

88
00:03:59,870 --> 00:04:01,770
Let us men raise our cups together.

89
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:06,100
Alright.

90
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,670
I'll have a drink

91
00:04:08,690 --> 00:04:09,860
with you two princes.

92
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:20,220
Xiyao,

93
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,310
let me escort you out of the palace.

94
00:04:22,330 --> 00:04:23,160
Thank you, Cousin Yan.

95
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:23,630
Let's go.

96
00:04:23,770 --> 00:04:25,110
Thank you, Cousin Yan.

97
00:04:25,870 --> 00:04:26,840
Bai Xiyue,

98
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:28,940
I'll see how you seduce Pei Si, just as you did

99
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,000
in your previous life.

100
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,840
Pei Si!

101
00:04:31,250 --> 00:04:32,250
You're being too absurd!

102
00:04:37,350 --> 00:04:38,130
Cousin Xiyue,

103
00:04:38,159 --> 00:04:39,090
are you alright?

104
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,540
Cousin Yan,

105
00:04:40,570 --> 00:04:42,550
I'm so scared.

106
00:04:43,880 --> 00:04:46,180
Xiyue and I are in love.

107
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:47,610
What right do you have to ruin this for me?

108
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:48,460
Is that so?

109
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:50,960
Then how about I go to Grandmother and ask for permission

110
00:04:50,990 --> 00:04:52,170
to marry her on your behalf?

111
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:53,380
Pei Yan...

112
00:04:54,070 --> 00:04:56,580
Don't think you can throw your weight around just because the Empress Dowager favors you.

113
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,170
When I become the Crown Prince,

114
00:04:58,200 --> 00:04:59,500
I'll make you pay!

115
00:04:59,530 --> 00:05:00,830
Even if you're the eldest son,

116
00:05:00,850 --> 00:05:02,100
I'm the Empress's son!

117
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,380
It's hard to say who will be kneeling to whom in the future.

118
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:05,020
You...

119
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:11,550
Let's go.

120
00:05:16,510 --> 00:05:17,420
Xiyao,

121
00:05:17,890 --> 00:05:19,040
how was the taste

122
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:20,270
of today's banquet?

123
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,220
It was still very delicious.

124
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,320
My guqin!

125
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:26,960
I left my guqin at the Cining Palace.

126
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:29,240
Someone will probably send it to the Music Bureau.

127
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:30,850
You can retrieve it tomorrow.

128
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:33,350
But that guqin was made by Master Qishan.

129
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:35,130
Only one exists in the world.

130
00:05:35,270 --> 00:05:37,330
It's very precious to me.

131
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:39,100
Let me guess—

132
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:40,970
Bai Xiyue will go back to retrieve her guqin,

133
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:44,280
take a wrong turn, and somehow find herself in the Eldest Prince's chambers.

134
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,780
They will end up drinking and chatting merrily,

135
00:05:46,159 --> 00:05:47,790
and finally, in their drunken state, they'll engage in sexual relations,

136
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,150
with Bai Xiyue giving herself to the Eldest Prince.

137
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,650
Is that the plan?

138
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,490
Prince Yi,

139
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,610
may I trouble Your Highness to accompany my sister in retrieving her guqin?

140
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:00,490
She's not familiar with the palace,

141
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:01,880
and I'm afraid that she might easily lose her way.

142
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,900
Didn't Miss Xiyue

143
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,230
often play with me

144
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:07,450
in the palace when we were children?

145
00:06:07,470 --> 00:06:08,700
How could she possibly get lost?

146
00:06:09,630 --> 00:06:11,340
Your Highness, there's no need to trouble you.

147
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,860
I can go with

148
00:06:12,890 --> 00:06:13,800
palace servants.

149
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:20,100
You're afraid Yun Yichen might mess up your plans, aren't you?

150
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:21,200
Alright then.

151
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:23,410
Cousin Yan.

152
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:25,300
Why don't you accompany Xiyue?

153
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,100
You're the most familiar with the palace.

154
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:27,900
If anything happens...

155
00:06:27,900 --> 00:06:29,060
I'll take my leave.

156
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,950
If anything happens,

157
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:33,909
with you, the Third Prince, there,

158
00:06:33,930 --> 00:06:35,300
no one would dare to bully Xiyue.

159
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:37,970
Going back and forth

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,260
is too much trouble.

161
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:41,360
I'll just send a servant to fetch it.

162
00:06:42,620 --> 00:06:43,760
Cousin Yan,

163
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:46,240
you rarely get to see Xiyue.

164
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,460
You should take this chance to spend more time with her.

165
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:49,230
I'll wait for you in the carriage.

166
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:50,659
Oh, you.

167
00:06:51,230 --> 00:06:52,730
I really can't say no to you.

168
00:06:54,470 --> 00:06:56,040
Whatever you ask, Xiyao,

169
00:06:56,070 --> 00:06:57,200
I will always agree to.

170
00:06:59,170 --> 00:06:59,740
Let's go.

171
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:07,170
Don't say that I didn't help you,

172
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:08,630
future Empress.

173
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:30,460
What are you doing?

174
00:07:33,490 --> 00:07:34,290
Hurry...

175
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:35,710
hurry and leave the palace.

176
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:37,120
Why...

177
00:07:37,150 --> 00:07:38,640
why didn't you get on your own carriage?

178
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,230
My carriage is at the east side gate.

179
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:42,360
There's no time.

180
00:07:42,540 --> 00:07:44,400
No time for what?

181
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:47,470
That cup of wine... was poisoned.

182
00:07:48,070 --> 00:07:48,980
Wine?

183
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:50,540
That cup of wine?

184
00:07:51,060 --> 00:07:52,250
Pei Si's cup?

185
00:07:53,830 --> 00:07:55,830
Bai Xiyue tried to poison him

186
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,540
while no one was looking?

187
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,520
Pei Si took the wrong cup.

188
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,140
That cup of wine with poison...

189
00:08:03,050 --> 00:08:04,410
Yun Yichen drank it!

190
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:08,080
Hurry!

191
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:08,850
Take us out of the palace!

192
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,140
But the Second Miss is still inside.

193
00:08:10,200 --> 00:08:10,870
Stop talking!

194
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:11,930
If anything happens, I'll take the blame!

195
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:12,940
Yes, my Lady!

196
00:08:13,820 --> 00:08:14,650
Hya!

197
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:16,490
Hya!

198
00:08:27,710 --> 00:08:28,220
You...

199
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:28,800
My Lady,

200
00:08:28,830 --> 00:08:29,490
we're out of the palace now.

201
00:08:29,530 --> 00:08:31,000
Are you... alright?

202
00:08:31,450 --> 00:08:32,460
I...

203
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,950
can only suppress the poison for an hour at most.

204
00:08:35,490 --> 00:08:36,919
Quickly, go to the Duke's Mansion.

205
00:08:37,150 --> 00:08:38,070
No,

206
00:08:38,090 --> 00:08:40,320
our family's carriage heading to your residence...

207
00:08:40,409 --> 00:08:42,640
What would people think if I went to your place in the middle of the night?

208
00:08:42,659 --> 00:08:43,500
Return to Bai's Mansion.

209
00:08:43,530 --> 00:08:45,080
You'll need to figure something out on your own later.

210
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,280
Did you hear me?

211
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,940
You want to abandon me again?

212
00:08:53,660 --> 00:08:54,210
Your Highness,

213
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,050
this way, please.

214
00:09:01,660 --> 00:09:02,660
Xiyue...

215
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:03,800
Bai Xiyue...

216
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:04,750
Xiyue,

217
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:06,350
I knew you still cared about me.

218
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:07,590
You've finally come.

219
00:09:08,090 --> 00:09:09,490
The servants reported

220
00:09:09,510 --> 00:09:10,270
that you've been clamoring

221
00:09:10,290 --> 00:09:11,960
that you have something important to tell me.

222
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,630
Well, I'm here now.

223
00:09:13,950 --> 00:09:14,740
Out with it.

224
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:15,750
Xiyue,

225
00:09:16,470 --> 00:09:17,740
someone wants to harm you.

226
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,300
Someone wants to kill you!

227
00:09:19,940 --> 00:09:21,240
Who might that be?

228
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:22,410
It's Bai Xiyao.

229
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:23,780
Bai Xiyao wants to harm you.

230
00:09:23,810 --> 00:09:24,740
She wants to harm you!

231
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:26,270
You can't go to the coronation ceremony!

232
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:27,330
Do you hear me?

233
00:09:27,330 --> 00:09:28,630
You're really insane!

234
00:09:29,410 --> 00:09:31,240
Bai Xiyao has been dead for a long time.

235
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:32,810
You're wasting my time.

236
00:09:34,330 --> 00:09:35,490
I'm not crazy,

237
00:09:35,510 --> 00:09:36,360
Xiyue!

238
00:09:36,390 --> 00:09:37,500
Don't abandon me!

239
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:38,940
Don't abandon me!

240
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,640
Xiyue, why don't you believe me?

241
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,920
♫In a single thought♫

242
00:09:43,220 --> 00:09:44,820
♫Is it love or hate♫

243
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:47,250
♫It's all just the mortal world♫

244
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:49,570
♫Several rounds of reincarnation♫

245
00:09:49,570 --> 00:09:50,340
Xiyue...

246
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:51,920
♫Burning away karmic flames♫

247
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:52,310
I love you so much.

248
00:09:52,310 --> 00:09:53,950
♫Wishing not to love, not to meet♫

249
00:09:53,950 --> 00:09:54,920
Don't abandon me.

250
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:57,260
♫One entanglement♫

251
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:58,880
♫Hard to break through three lifetimes♫

252
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:01,670
♫Who was it?♫

♫Love falls♫

♫Who would return?♫

256
00:10:07,550 --> 00:10:08,550
Your Highness,

257
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:10,220
the prisoner has died.

258
00:10:16,960 --> 00:10:17,790
I

259
00:10:17,820 --> 00:10:19,330
want to take Bai Xiyue as my wife.

260
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:20,300
Don't worry.

261
00:10:20,470 --> 00:10:22,380
I'll find a way to break off the engagement.

262
00:10:22,410 --> 00:10:23,340
Xiyue,

263
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,690
you are what I treasure most in this world.

264
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,660
Bury him.

265
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:35,840
Yes, Your Highness.

266
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,680
Consider it my repayment for what I owed you in my past life.

267
00:10:42,190 --> 00:10:43,120
To Qingzhi Pavilion,

268
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:44,030
East Street!

269
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:44,720
Yes, my Lady!

270
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,160
Thank you, Cousin Yan,

271
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:52,780
for helping me find my guqin.

272
00:10:53,030 --> 00:10:53,900
It's nothing.

273
00:10:54,390 --> 00:10:56,590
Xiyue, you truly are one who loves the guqin dearly.

274
00:10:57,610 --> 00:10:59,120
Cousin Yan...

275
00:10:59,190 --> 00:11:01,560
did you enjoy my performance tonight?

276
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:02,550
I did indeed.

277
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:04,500
I've always enjoyed listening to the guqin.

278
00:11:04,740 --> 00:11:06,280
Your skill, Xiyue,

279
00:11:06,300 --> 00:11:07,770
is truly elegant

280
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:08,840
and masterful.

281
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:11,730
However...

282
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,500
However what?

283
00:11:14,580 --> 00:11:15,900
I just never expected

284
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:18,260
that Xiyao's dance would be so graceful

285
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,390
and breathtaking.

286
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:23,590
I never thought

287
00:11:23,670 --> 00:11:25,910
that Xiyao could dance so well.

288
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:29,190
My sister likes to hide her talents.

289
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:31,170
Even at home,

290
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:33,490
I've never seen her practice dancing.

291
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:35,910
Perhaps this is her natural talent.

292
00:11:36,630 --> 00:11:38,090
Xiyao

293
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:40,380
is always so brilliantly talented.

294
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:47,940
My Lady.

295
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,690
The last person who gossiped about me

296
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,450
is now resting peacefully at the bottom of Wangxin Lake.

297
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:52,740
You've heard about it in the Bai family, right?

298
00:11:52,770 --> 00:11:53,790
I swear on my life

299
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,210
that I won't say a single word more.

300
00:11:55,390 --> 00:11:57,630
This residence needs a steward.

301
00:11:57,660 --> 00:11:58,810
Can I trust you?

302
00:11:58,970 --> 00:11:59,880
My Lady,

303
00:11:59,900 --> 00:12:01,770
my loyalty is yours and yours alone.

304
00:12:01,990 --> 00:12:02,730
From now on,

305
00:12:02,750 --> 00:12:03,560
you shall

306
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:05,280
be the only master I serve, my Lady.

307
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:07,470
I kowtow in gratitude for this promotion, my Lady.

308
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,520
You're quite clever indeed.

309
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:12,940
Go bring some silver needles, strong liquor,

310
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:14,170
and a few bamboo tubes here.

311
00:12:14,390 --> 00:12:14,970
Yes, my Lady.

312
00:12:33,300 --> 00:12:35,230
He must've been drugged with that thing.

313
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,330
He just took random medicines to suppress it.

314
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:40,190
I should help him dispel the effects of the drug first.

315
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:46,800
Where is your carriage?

316
00:12:48,760 --> 00:12:50,810
I think my sister didn't wait for me

317
00:12:50,840 --> 00:12:52,230
and returned home first.

318
00:12:52,250 --> 00:12:53,480
How could that be?

319
00:12:53,530 --> 00:12:55,560
Xiyao promised to wait for us to return.

320
00:12:56,720 --> 00:12:58,270
But what should we do now?

321
00:12:58,590 --> 00:13:00,720
It's almost curfew time.

322
00:13:01,050 --> 00:13:01,600
I...

323
00:13:01,820 --> 00:13:04,150
I don't dare to walk back home alone.

324
00:13:04,530 --> 00:13:06,030
Don't worry, Xiyue.

325
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,230
I'll take you back to my palace

326
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:08,500
and arrange a guest room for you.

327
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:10,090
I'll have someone check if your sister's really gone back.

328
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:11,280
If she has,

329
00:13:11,420 --> 00:13:12,580
you can just stay the night in my palace

330
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:14,010
and head home in the morning.

331
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:18,330
Thank you, Cousin Yan.

332
00:13:18,630 --> 00:13:19,300
Let's go.

333
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,100
My Lady,

334
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,890
all the things you wanted are here.

335
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,170
You may go now.

336
00:13:26,740 --> 00:13:27,400
Yes, my Lady.

337
00:13:39,540 --> 00:13:40,510
You're so beautiful.

338
00:13:40,850 --> 00:13:41,450
You smell so good.

339
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,680
Enough, enough.

340
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:44,480
Hadn't you had your fill in the past life?

341
00:13:45,570 --> 00:13:46,390
Yichen,

342
00:13:46,410 --> 00:13:47,130
no.

343
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:48,850
Xiyao hasn't been found yet.

344
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:50,930
I don't want to be your concubine.

345
00:13:50,950 --> 00:13:52,510
Bai Xiyao has run away with another man.

346
00:13:52,590 --> 00:13:54,530
Let her die out there.

347
00:13:54,760 --> 00:13:56,160
The one I want to marry the most

348
00:13:56,180 --> 00:13:57,740
is my Little Bai.

349
00:13:57,770 --> 00:14:00,260
To be the Duchess like my sister?

350
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,920
If it's not the most precious thing in the world,

351
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,440
I don't care for it.

352
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:05,870
Xiyue.

353
00:14:06,670 --> 00:14:09,290
I have 300,000 Yun Iron Cavalry stationed outside.

354
00:14:09,420 --> 00:14:11,190
Even if you want the seat of the Empress,

355
00:14:11,220 --> 00:14:12,860
I'll seize it for you.

356
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:25,300
♫In my dream, the curtain sways♫

00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,050

Let me extract the Love-Slave Elixir for you

367
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:53,220
so you won't turn into a madman.

368
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:54,050
We'll be even then.
