1
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,480
The design has already been patented.

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:15,120
I’m the one who did that.

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:18,680
Although you have to do everything in your power

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,440
so that the jewelry can’t be displayed at the world jewelry event.

5
00:00:21,440 --> 00:00:23,400
I can wait and go there with P’Sun.

6
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,360
Should I wait or not?

7
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:28,440
I can just go there myself.

8
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:39,240
Is P’Sun still in the meeting?

9
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:43,039
Although you have to do everything in your power

10
00:01:43,039 --> 00:01:45,920
so that the jewelry can’t be displayed at the world jewelry event.

11
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:49,000
That amount of money can help your family.

12
00:01:50,120 --> 00:01:52,640
He for sure isn’t done with his meeting.

13
00:02:00,280 --> 00:02:01,600
Why am I having such a bad headache?

14
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,000
Lin! Lin! Lin!

15
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
Chan?/Khun Sun!

16
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:07,760
Can you look after him for me?

17
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:08,600
Of course.

18
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:30,840
Can you give me the money now? I need to run away.

19
00:04:30,840 --> 00:04:32,640
You think I would stiff you?

20
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,040
Let me see the thing first.

21
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:38,920
Give it to me then you need to hide away.

22
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,280
Once the event is over I will transfer you the money immediately.

23
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:47,360
No! Money first and this will be yours.

24
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,880
Don’t you trust me?

25
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:54,240
I’va been thinking about this. I think you’re using me.

26
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:59,480
How can this damn necklace be sold? If it has been patented.

27
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,720
I want them to not have the necklace for the competition!

28
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:04,880
So Sun will be fired and I will take over his position!

29
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,080
And this money is just a bonus from that.

30
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:12,360
So you lied to me about JC too?

31
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:13,360
I did not!

32
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,040
I put this piece in the dark market already and there are people who are interested.

33
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,000
The price we will get is so much more than that we paid.

34
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:28,160
Now I’m being honest with you. Give it to me now!

35
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:28,680
No!

36
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:32,920
As I said you must give me the money first then I will give you this. I’m not falling for your crap.

37
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:33,840
I said give me the damn thing!

38
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:34,360
No!

39
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:36,440
Get off this!

40
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:44,280
Without you! The secret remains the secret.

41
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:14,280
This is police!

42
00:06:14,320 --> 00:06:16,920
Raise your hands! Arrest him!

43
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:18,800
I didn’t do anything.

44
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,720
It’s all his fault, Khun Sun.

45
00:07:38,640 --> 00:07:39,440
Lin!

46
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:47,080
Finally, you’re up.

47
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,840
I’m so scared that you might not wake up to see me anymore.

48
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,080
What happened, P’Sun?

49
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,920
Lin! Lin!

50
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:27,160
Ah, I remember now.

51
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,080
It’s you who helped me out?

52
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:33,679
Don’t you believe in a miracle anymore?

53
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:36,640
I do…

54
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:44,720
I do believe that you’re my miracle.

55
00:08:59,960 --> 00:09:01,840
I really think that you wouldn’t wake up to me.

56
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:05,960
I’m really sorry for not taking care of you very well.

57
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,320
It’s fine, I’m right here.

58
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,080
I won’t be away from you anymore.

59
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:41,240
Thank you.

60
00:10:03,560 --> 00:10:05,200
The president was flying to catch Salin

61
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:09,000
and he also was avoiding the car at the speed of 180 kilometers per hour.

62
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:14,640
How could P’Kaew commit such a thing?

63
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:16,920
Even though she was just trying to pay for her mother hospital's expenses.

64
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:18,480
Is she really going to kill a person for that?

65
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:23,120
The president saw the flaw so he tampered her plan

66
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:26,840
by tricking her so she thought that she already had the necklace.

67
00:10:27,480 --> 00:10:30,080
Then the president used his Ninja’s skill

68
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:35,960
to follow Kaewmanee and finally found out the real mastermind who that person is Korn!

69
00:10:37,960 --> 00:10:42,320
I already figured that Korn is an evil person.

70
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:48,200
And P’Kaewmanee is so stupid that she fell for his plan.

71
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:51,600
Right then Korn revealed his true skin and his evil plan.

72
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:57,480
Then he pulled out a gun to threaten Kaewmanee.

73
00:10:57,480 --> 00:10:58,600
Don’t please. Don’t!

74
00:10:59,280 --> 00:11:01,880
“Give me the damn necklace or you won’t get any money" he said.

75
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:06,280
One the president saw that he transformed into a Hero.

76
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,240
Although at the time Korn was about to pull the trigger.

77
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:16,400
So the president was able to use his hand and stop the bullet.

78
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:17,520
That’s crazy!

79
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,920
So the president used his ultimate skill

80
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:24,200
then Korn was no match to the president.

81
00:11:27,280 --> 00:11:28,080
And now both of them…

82
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:30,360
are in jail.

83
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,480
The president is really perfect to be the chosen one.

84
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:40,920
What a dramatic story!

85
00:11:41,320 --> 00:11:42,480
I’m having goosebumps!

86
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:44,040
He’s so cool.

87
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:48,160
Do you think he watches too much anime?

88
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:51,560
I think he over-exaggerated.

89
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:56,200
He seems to really enjoy watching movies.

90
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,800
If anyone wants to know more about this, don’t forget to tune in at Channel One 31.

91
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,480
As for the UNCUT version is available at IQIYI.

92
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,960
What are we waiting for? We should just buy the VIP package.

93
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,000
I don’t have the app yet.

94
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,000
Did you guys already have the VIP package?

95
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:13,560
No, not yet!

96
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,280
Juladis, you need to teach me how to get the VIP package.

97
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:16,400
Let’s do this.

98
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:16,720
Alright.

99
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:18,680
I will pay for all of you.

100
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:20,840
Khun Sam!

101
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,880
That’d be great.

102
00:15:27,160 --> 00:15:27,920
Hello.

103
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:28,800
Hello to you too.

104
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,280
This year of the world jewelry event, Soul looks very promising.

105
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,200
Thank you so much.

106
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:56,560
The president himself really put his all into the competition.

107
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:00,200
That’s why I’ve seen so many improvements within your company.

108
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:01,960
You’re too kind.

109
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,800
Oh, Khun Sattabun, hello.

110
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,600
Hello, Madam.

111
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:09,720
This is Madam Pantira and Mister Sittichai.

112
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:12,600
And here he is Khun Sattabun, the owner of the hotel.

113
00:16:12,640 --> 00:16:14,320
Good evening./Good evening.

114
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,200
Why don’t all of you come to our lounge, this way please.

115
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,080
Right this way.

116
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:27,080
Hi there Khun Sun.

117
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,960
Hello, Khun Allie.

118
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:35,440
I can’t wait to see the jewelry from Soul.

119
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:37,520
Please look forward to that.

120
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:38,600
Always!

121
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:40,400
Then excuse us please.

122
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,240
Lin.

123
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,160
Hello, President.

124
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:53,680
Hello.

125
00:16:54,520 --> 00:16:57,680
There are so many people inside and it looks so elegant.

126
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:58,840
Really?

127
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:03,120
I just went in and saw so many professional models there.

128
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:04,800
Her eyes are glowing.

129
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:11,400
Why? They look good. Totally my style! Although I only have my heart for only one person.

130
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:15,319
Come on, Lin. Let’s show them what we got.

131
00:17:16,800 --> 00:17:17,880
I’m nervous.

132
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:20,440
Why? In this whole event, you’re the best.

133
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,160
Really?

134
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,280
Come on,  let’s go

135
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,359
I’m so excited for you.

136
00:17:29,600 --> 00:17:32,480
Bro, if he wins,

137
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:35,800
is there anything that you will give him?

138
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,800
Where is everyone?

139
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:58,120
No one waits for me!

140
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:01,840
Stop talking now!

141
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,160
We should get inside the hotel now.

142
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:19,240
I’ve been looking for you. I was wondering where you could be.

143
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:21,800
What’s on your mind?

144
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:27,760
Worry?

145
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:35,160
Yes, I’m scared that I might damage the company's reputation.

146
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:39,160
And also I’m scared that I might disappoint you.

147
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:49,080
Lin, listens to me.

148
00:18:52,040 --> 00:18:55,080
You’re the best and you can do this.

149
00:18:58,200 --> 00:18:59,320
I believe in you.

150
00:19:03,760 --> 00:19:04,560
Then…

151
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:08,120
can you also believe in yourself too?

152
00:19:10,520 --> 00:19:11,320
Thanks for that.

153
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,600
You wanna know something?

154
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:20,840
I love you even more than myself.

155
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,280
This is a small gift for you.

156
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:40,600
But once the event is over there's something bigger waiting for you.

157
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:43,680
P’Sun!

158
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,840
Khun Salin, it’s time to get ready.

159
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:52,600
Alright, I’ll follow you in just a moment.

160
00:19:52,640 --> 00:19:53,400
Okay.

161
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,160
Thank you.

162
00:19:57,440 --> 00:19:58,840
I really have to go now.

163
00:20:00,360 --> 00:20:02,640
Don’t forget to smile at me when I walk on the runway.

164
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:04,160
I always smile for you.

165
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:08,800
I think you should hurry. So that the event can be over soon.

166
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,680
Let’s go get that prize.

167
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,760
Here come the final perfomance for tonight. Honorable guests,

168
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:50,440
These are the six final pieces for the World Jewelry Award.For tonight

169
00:23:50,440 --> 00:23:55,440
let's find out who would be the winner in the moment together.

170
00:23:58,200 --> 00:24:02,040
The moment we've been waiting for and the results’ with me now.

171
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:15,760
the winner of the World's Jewelry Award is

172
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,280
Sunset x Vibes from the Soul high jewelry.

173
00:24:48,520 --> 00:24:50,640
With the last light of the setting sun,

174
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:53,720
the moon appears to shine with a bright aura

175
00:24:53,920 --> 00:24:57,160
sparkling together on a path that couldn't be met,

176
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:00,720
and the result is this wonderful set of jewelry.

177
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:12,080
Finally, it’s us. Soul won. We won. It’s been many years and finally we rise at the top again.

178
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:19,640
Lin, you did it! Soul did it.

179
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:23,120
Right, you’re the best.

180
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,600
Lin, you won us such a big accomplishment like this.

181
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:29,280
My bro’s going to give you a huge gift for three whole days for sure.

182
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:31,560
Can I go to? Where?

183
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:37,560
No, don’t you mess with them. Stay with me.

184
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,760
May I have the honor of welcoming Mister Suriyen,president soul high jury to the stage.

185
00:25:55,200 --> 00:26:00,040

186
00:26:00,360 --> 00:26:04,280
I have to thank my mum.

187
00:26:08,080 --> 00:26:11,200
She gave me the chance to work for Soul High Jewelry.

188
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:16,480
And thank you to the jewelry design team for all the hard work,

189
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:22,920
the designer of this masterpiece

190
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:27,680
Salin.

191
00:26:28,680 --> 00:26:33,400
Without Salin, everything good today would not have happened.

192
00:26:44,840 --> 00:26:51,800
So honorable guests, this marks the huge moment for Soul High Jewelry as their big comeback

193
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:29,040
P’Sun, what are you doing here?

194
00:27:30,280 --> 00:27:31,200
I’m here to see you.

195
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:33,160
Right.

196
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:37,400
And why haven't you changed yet?

197
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:44,080
My feets are hurt. I was in high heels until the end of the event.

198
00:27:48,040 --> 00:27:50,920
Here, let me give you a massage.

199
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:54,320
That’s fine. You don’t have to.

200
00:27:55,200 --> 00:27:56,000
Lin.

201
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,240
Let me take care of you please?

202
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,240
Does it hurt right here?

203
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:12,960
Oh, you’re right.

204
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,440
You did such an excellent job.

205
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:25,600
When you walked out the audiences were so amazed.

206
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:26,840
Is that really true?

207
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,520
Yes, didn’t I tell you that you will pull this off.

208
00:28:32,840 --> 00:28:38,720
Thank you, P’Sun. Without your support I wouldn’t have done this.

209
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:48,000
You’re so beautiful today.

210
00:28:49,920 --> 00:28:51,320
You’re being sweet again.

211
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:04,040
P’Sun, I think I should get change now.

212
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,880
Wait for me just a moment, okay?

213
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:10,840
You can sit and wait for me right here.

214
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,560
Khun Dad, I can’t take this off myself.

215
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:57,040
Will you take it off for me?

216
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,080
Let me see.

217
00:30:15,800 --> 00:30:17,320
Which part of this doesn't come off?

218
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:01,640
You’re very sexy today.

219
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:07,600
It was so hard for me to hold things back.

220
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:12,000
And what would you want to have done with me?

221
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:44,400
Nu-Lin…

222
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:52,040
Would you mind if I rip your clothes away?

223
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,360
Everything right here is yours anyway.

224
00:31:58,840 --> 00:32:02,200
You can do whatever you desire.

225
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:38,560
Khun Dad.

226
00:32:40,520 --> 00:32:42,400
You must be very tired today.

227
00:32:46,520 --> 00:32:48,400
Today, can I help you instead?

228
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:20,080
For the past 3 months our company's performance has improved and grown significantly.

229
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:23,800
Compared to the last 3 years.

230
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:27,600
I would like to thank the designing team

231
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:33,400
And thank you for everyone’s courage to embrace change for our company.

232
00:35:35,600 --> 00:35:43,440
With Kaewmanee no longer here, The position of head of the designing team is now empty.

233
00:35:48,080 --> 00:35:50,920
I would like you to take care of that, Tinnakorn.

234
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,720
I’m on it, president.

235
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:59,120
In the span of three months, you really impressed me.

236
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:10,320
I’ve known that you could do this.

237
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,360
You are a whole package, handsome and good at your work.

238
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:21,120
I’m sure that our company will be the best it could ever be.

239
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:25,560
That is why Madam Wang trusts you so much with her company.

240
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:30,560
Madam Wang has really sharp eyes for people right?

241
00:36:31,960 --> 00:36:35,520
Alright. Congratulations to you president.

242
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:33,200
Time flew by so fast right?

243
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:40,960
Let’s go, Let’s go pack our stuff.

244
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:24,200
You guys are leaving?

245
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:26,240
Won’t wait for me a bit to pack my stuff?

246
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,440
Sam, why are you wearing these?

247
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:33,640
Well, we became an intern together and now we have to go back together.

248
00:39:33,880 --> 00:39:34,680
Isn’t that true?

249
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,640
They are so in love.

250
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:37,360
What?

251
00:39:37,600 --> 00:39:38,400
Nothing!

252
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:38,960
Yeah, nothing.

253
00:39:41,000 --> 00:39:42,440
Once you leave this place.

254
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:47,440
Always remember that who took care of you and who trained you guys, got it?

255
00:39:47,920 --> 00:39:49,040
Yes.

256
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,120
It’s their last day and you’re still messing with them?

257
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,760
Enough, they are done with their internship already.

258
00:39:55,240 --> 00:40:00,000
Good luck to all of you kiddos. Don’t forget to come by sometime when you’re free.

259
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:00,840
That’s right.

260
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,400
We’ll do that for sure.

261
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:11,520
All of you are so talented. Please always keep that within yourself.

262
00:40:11,520 --> 00:40:14,640
I truly believe that all of you guys will get further than I am.

263
00:40:15,600 --> 00:40:17,120
I’m always going to support you guys.

264
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:25,040
We would like to thank all of you for taking care of us and training us for the last 4 months.

265
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,440
We learned a lot from you guys.

266
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:29,240
Thank you, P’Prim.

267
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:34,280
Once we’re gone I bet that P’Juladis is going to miss us the most.

268
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,760
Oh! There’s no way..

269
00:40:36,880 --> 00:40:38,960
There’s no way that you won’t miss us right?

270
00:40:42,520 --> 00:40:44,680
Well, I think that we really have to go now.

271
00:40:44,840 --> 00:40:45,680
See you again.

272
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:46,280
Okay.

273
00:40:46,280 --> 00:40:46,960
Good luck to you.

274
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:47,680
Good luck!

275
00:40:51,200 --> 00:40:55,520
Everybody! The president wants to meet you guys for the last time in his room..

276
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:07,000
They’re all here, president.

277
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,600
I don’t want to leave just yet.

278
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:13,920
Hey!

279
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:14,600
P’Sun

280
00:41:15,480 --> 00:41:18,120
President, why are you here?

281
00:41:18,120 --> 00:41:21,120
I thought that you would wait for them in your room.

282
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:24,960
Is there a problem? Am I not welcome here?

283
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:29,200
Of course, you are.

284
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:37,200
Here, let me help.

285
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:39,520
That’s fine. I can hold this myself.

286
00:41:40,080 --> 00:41:44,800
Don’t be stubborn. Wait until you're taller than me then I will let you hold stuff yourself.

287
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,720
Alright.

288
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,640
Let’s go home, Nu-Lin.

289
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,520
Yes,daddy..

290
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:56,800
See you soon, kiddos.

291
00:41:58,480 --> 00:41:59,280
Good bye.

292
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:01,360
Bye bye.

293
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:03,200
See you soon.

294
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:04,120
Right.

295
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:06,680
Daddy…

296
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,280
Daddy!

297
00:42:08,600 --> 00:42:10,120
Daddy…

298
00:42:12,000 --> 00:42:13,800
I will take you home today.

299
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:17,480
No need to. I’m all grown up now.

300
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:20,200
Why do you have to argue with me? Let’s just go home.

301
00:42:24,280 --> 00:42:25,840
Oh wow! Oh wow!

302
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:28,880
What! They are all left.

303
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,760
Your home is on my way. Would you come with me?

304
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,320
You’re pulling this trick again.

305
00:42:45,880 --> 00:42:48,360
Are you going to do this for the rest of your life?

306
00:42:51,240 --> 00:42:53,120
Will you let me do that then?

307
00:42:57,320 --> 00:42:58,960
All of you just go. Leave!

308
00:42:59,480 --> 00:43:02,400
I feel like I’m about to have a sugar rush now. There are too many sweet couples around here.

309
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,320
Let’s go.

310
00:43:08,520 --> 00:43:09,400
Thank you.

311
00:43:09,960 --> 00:43:10,960
Let’s get going.

312
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,440
Really?

313
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:17,720
Would you look at them?

314
00:43:31,560 --> 00:43:35,280
That’s good I guess. I like seeing them as couples.

315
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,880
As fun as watching me?

316
00:43:41,840 --> 00:43:42,520
Hmm?

317
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,040
It’s still a handful as usual.

318
00:43:48,400 --> 00:43:48,840
Let’s go.

319
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:56,440
Thank you for always walking me home.

320
00:43:57,560 --> 00:44:01,440
You don’t have to. It's what I normally do anyway.

321
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:06,160
Uhmm. That’s not it.

322
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:11,520
What is it then? It’s a boyfriend thing to walk a boyfriend home.

323
00:44:12,520 --> 00:44:19,120
Well, they do that but friends can do that as well.

324
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,480
That’s right. So what should we do as a couple?

325
00:44:29,120 --> 00:44:34,080
We should do this.

326
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:52,440
This is how I would like my boyfriend to walk me home.

327
00:44:54,440 --> 00:44:56,800
You really like to tease me from the first day up until now.

328
00:44:57,200 --> 00:44:58,080
And do you…

329
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,720
want to have me to keep teasing you around forever or not?

330
00:45:01,960 --> 00:45:02,600
I’d love that.

331
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,160
Before I go

332
00:45:05,840 --> 00:45:08,960
can I walk you home as your boyfriend again?

333
00:45:39,120 --> 00:45:43,720
P’Prim, since I’m already done with my internship.

334
00:45:44,920 --> 00:45:48,280
Can I ask you for one thing?

335
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:50,880
What would you like to ask me then?

336
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,080
Did you remember?

337
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:09,520
Back then when I asked you for your signature but you refused to give me.

338
00:46:14,880 --> 00:46:22,760
My beautiful senior, My cool senior. Can I have your signature now?

339
00:46:24,800 --> 00:46:28,800
And of course your cool senior will sign it for you.

340
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,560
Give that to me so I will sign for you.

341
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:32,160
Here you go.

342
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:34,720
Draw me a heart as well.

343
00:46:36,520 --> 00:46:37,480
I’ll give you as big as this one.

344
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:50,040
Did you know that when you ran away from me

345
00:46:50,720 --> 00:46:54,840
or when you walked away from me and not care for me

346
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,920
I was really sad?

347
00:46:58,680 --> 00:47:01,080
I was so confused and sad at the same time.

348
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:06,000
Why did you do that?

349
00:47:06,200 --> 00:47:07,280
Why did you hurt me?

350
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,040
Why?

351
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:14,960
How could I ever possibly hold it back? It was hard.

352
00:47:16,680 --> 00:47:17,800
Hold wat back?

353
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:49,000
I love you. (In several languages)

354
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:55,480
All of what I said means I love you.

355
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:05,840
I got it now.

356
00:48:08,760 --> 00:48:11,800
My heart is beating so fast now. It’s beating so fast because of you.

357
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:16,600
What??

358
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:19,600
P’Prim!!

359
00:48:20,720 --> 00:48:22,560
Don’t do that to my heart.

360
00:48:45,720 --> 00:48:46,200
Oops!

361
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:52,640
P’Prim, it’s raining.

362
00:48:53,160 --> 00:48:54,160
We should get in the car now.

363
00:48:54,520 --> 00:48:57,200
It went right in my eye. Hurry, you will get sick.

364
00:48:57,880 --> 00:48:59,400
Hurry up.

365
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,160
Is there a bird in the toilet?

366
00:50:39,160 --> 00:50:40,560
Why are you getting here so slowly?

367
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:41,960
Slowly but surely.

368
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:45,160
Let me slap you ass now.

369
00:50:45,280 --> 00:50:46,480
I heard birds but I don’t know where it’s coming from.

370
00:50:47,960 --> 00:50:49,520
Are there birds here?

371
00:50:50,600 --> 00:50:51,800
No, nothing.

372
00:50:51,880 --> 00:50:54,320
I’ll be right there after I’m done peeing.

373
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:56,040
That’s my Dad.

374
00:50:56,040 --> 00:50:57,240
Dad? Whose dad?

375
00:50:57,640 --> 00:50:59,400
My Dad. Juljul’s Dad.

376
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:00,480
Juljul’s Dad?

377
00:51:00,480 --> 00:51:01,720
Juljul’s dad works here?

378
00:51:01,720 --> 00:51:02,400
Yeah.

379
00:51:04,760 --> 00:51:08,920
Dis? Are you in there? Jul?

380
00:51:13,360 --> 00:51:15,160
Not responding to me?

381
00:51:22,920 --> 00:51:25,840
Now, it’s clear. Clearly that you’re in there.

382
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:27,600
Not answer my call?

383
00:51:27,600 --> 00:51:28,520
Are you in there?

384
00:51:28,520 --> 00:51:29,280
No, I’m not.

385
00:51:29,400 --> 00:51:30,160
No?

386
00:51:41,520 --> 00:51:42,600
Okay, fine.

387
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:45,440
Hurry and finish whatever you’re doing, son.

388
00:51:46,080 --> 00:51:48,520
Hurry and go home early too. Your mom is waiting for you.

389
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,240
Should I look?

390
00:52:01,680 --> 00:52:02,600
Do you want to keep going?

391
00:52:03,480 --> 00:52:04,400
P’Chan!

392
00:52:25,600 --> 00:52:26,280
Lin.

393
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,360
Are you really sure that you want to go back there again?

394
00:52:33,040 --> 00:52:33,880
I’m sure.

395
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,760
I just want to put an end to this.

396
00:52:38,440 --> 00:52:39,880
This time you don’t have to be afraid of anything, okay?

397
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:42,160
I’ll be right by your side.

398
00:52:43,400 --> 00:52:47,000
Of course, I'm not going to be afraid of anything because I have you.

399
00:53:11,400 --> 00:53:12,200
Are you ready?

400
00:53:16,120 --> 00:53:16,920
I am.

401
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:30,520
I’ll be waiting for you right here.

402
00:54:38,880 --> 00:54:40,800
You're as bright as I can remember.

403
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,240
Salin.

404
00:54:45,400 --> 00:54:45,920
Lord…

405
00:54:48,040 --> 00:54:49,280
Lord Phaya Suriyen.

406
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:57,560
Your eyes still remain the same ever since you were young.

407
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:06,200
So it’s really you who I’ve been seeing this whole time.

408
00:55:09,080 --> 00:55:12,920
Thank you for always protecting me.

409
00:55:15,400 --> 00:55:20,320
Because I’m bound to you by karma.

410
00:55:22,080 --> 00:55:26,200
Part of your spirit in you is a part of her purest spirit.

411
00:55:34,480 --> 00:55:40,360
Whatever that is in the box, I made a replica

412
00:55:43,600 --> 00:55:47,000
to replace the old necklace of Sirarin that went missing.

413
00:55:49,640 --> 00:55:50,680
You saw her?

414
00:55:52,160 --> 00:55:52,760
Yes.

415
00:55:56,280 --> 00:56:00,440
The thing that holds her spirit back is this necklace.

416
00:56:04,840 --> 00:56:10,160
She wants to give this to you again.

417
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:17,760
And also she would like to ask you for forgiveness

418
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:20,400
for her mistake in the past.

419
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:43,440
Sirarin.

420
00:56:48,040 --> 00:56:54,960
My love, I’m sorry.

421
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,760
I’m so sorry.

422
00:56:58,920 --> 00:57:00,160
I’m sorry to you too.

423
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:07,080
I’m sorry that I never considered your feelings.

424
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:08,920
That’s alright.

425
00:57:09,280 --> 00:57:15,480
Please don’t say sorry to me. Because you did the right thing.

426
00:57:19,120 --> 00:57:24,440
I would like to let you…be free.

427
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:26,440
Thank you so much.

428
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:35,280
If in the next life, we are destined to be together I want to be born to give all my love to you again.

429
00:58:00,520 --> 00:58:02,640
It’s time for me to go now.

430
00:58:05,240 --> 00:58:08,360
Will I be able to see you again?

431
00:58:08,360 --> 00:58:16,560
I’m done here. From now on he will be the one who will take care of you.

432
00:58:42,840 --> 00:58:43,640
P’Sun…

433
00:58:44,800 --> 00:58:45,600
Are you alright, Lin?

434
00:58:47,720 --> 00:58:48,520
Are you hurt anywhere?

435
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:52,960
Everything is over now.

436
00:58:57,240 --> 00:58:58,240
That’s nice to hear.

437
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:10,840
We should go back, Khun Dad.

438
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:49,640
What is it, P’Sun?

439
00:59:56,040 --> 00:59:59,520
It’s a shame that I don’t get to see the sunset with you.

440
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,120
P’Sun, Look at that.

441
01:00:05,920 --> 01:00:11,520
it’s just like you said that you are the sun,

442
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,440
and I’m the moon.

443
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:21,120
Who would think that the sun and the moon would travel to meet each other.

444
01:00:22,240 --> 01:00:26,880
Even though they are so far apart.

445
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:32,560
Although it’s just in a very short time.

446
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:35,600
But it is the most beautiful time.

447
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,800
Don’t you think so?

448
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:49,680
Thank you so much for coming into my life.

449
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:55,040
Thank you for you too for coming into my life as well.

450
01:00:58,560 --> 01:01:02,840
I’m so happy today. Everything went so well.

451
01:01:12,240 --> 01:01:13,040
What is this?

452
01:01:14,240 --> 01:01:19,320
This necklace, I got this made for you.

453
01:01:22,000 --> 01:01:25,920
It is made from the same gem as the one that you used to compete.

454
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:29,520
Let me put this on you.

455
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:46,560
Can I see?

456
01:01:49,800 --> 01:01:50,960
It suits you very well.

457
01:01:51,600 --> 01:01:52,600
Thanks.

458
01:01:55,800 --> 01:01:56,600
And…

459
01:01:58,440 --> 01:02:04,200
about that Lord Phaya something, do you love him?

460
01:02:12,840 --> 01:02:14,360
If it was me in the past life

461
01:02:15,600 --> 01:02:18,160
I think we would have that feeling for each other.

462
01:02:19,800 --> 01:02:20,600
And…

463
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:24,400
what about now?

464
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:26,440
Are you jealous?

465
01:02:27,320 --> 01:02:28,120
No, I’m not.

466
01:02:28,880 --> 01:02:30,080
I’m just asking.

467
01:02:31,840 --> 01:02:38,800
At this moment the person that I love is standing in front of me now.

468
01:02:46,320 --> 01:02:48,400
You’re the person that I love in this life.

469
01:02:50,280 --> 01:02:57,160
And I would also like to love you for this life, next life and million more lives to come.

470
01:02:58,520 --> 01:02:59,600
Can I just do that?

471
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:07,240
Well, I will love you forever as well.

472
01:03:08,560 --> 01:03:09,680
We have a deal!

473
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:22,760
After your graduation, would you like to work with us?

474
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:36,520
I have to look at your offers first. since I’m the winner of the world jewelry competition.

475
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:43,280
I think after I graduate, there will be a lot of companies vying for me.

476
01:03:44,640 --> 01:03:46,240
Let me see your offer again then.

477
01:03:47,560 --> 01:03:52,960
I think that none of the other companies would match with my offer.

478
01:03:54,280 --> 01:04:01,200
Because the thing that I’m going to offer you is me.

479
01:04:31,800 --> 01:04:33,480
Stay by my side so that you can keep hitting me like this forever, okay?

480
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:07,960
One, two, three.

481
01:05:08,120 --> 01:05:10,520
We graduate!!!

482
01:05:14,640 --> 01:05:20,640
Who would think by doing an internship in such a leading company like Soul

483
01:05:21,400 --> 01:05:27,160
can bring us so many wonderful stories beyond what we imagine?

484
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:32,960
I got to learn the techniques of designing intricate jewelry like a puzzle.

485
01:05:34,320 --> 01:05:38,480
I also got to work with such professionals in the field who I consider my family now.

486
01:05:40,040 --> 01:05:45,960
And even got to create work that has been well received, making my heart swell with pride.

487
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:52,800
Last but not least I got to experience warm and heartfelt friendships.

488
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:56,280
Happiness that nothing can compare to,

489
01:05:56,960 --> 01:05:58,720
unforgettable memories.

490
01:05:59,480 --> 01:06:01,360
and the beautiful love.

491
01:06:01,920 --> 01:06:07,120
It was just like I was in a romantic novel that started from working closely.

492
01:06:08,360 --> 01:06:12,760
Love that grew from supporting each other every step of the way.

493
01:06:14,560 --> 01:06:23,160
And for the perfect love that we have now will remain in our hearts forever.

494
01:06:40,720 --> 01:06:41,520
Lin.

495
01:06:42,480 --> 01:06:43,280
P’Sun.

496
01:06:45,520 --> 01:06:47,960
Welcome the new designer to Soul family.

497
01:06:53,440 --> 01:06:55,480
Thank you so much president.

498
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:00,760
This bouquet is a gift from the company.

499
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:02,800
It’s beautiful.

500
01:07:04,160 --> 01:07:08,760
And this is from Khun Dad to Nu-Lin.

501
01:07:10,440 --> 01:07:11,240
What is this?

502
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:13,040
Open it.

503
01:07:22,200 --> 01:07:27,320
You start your job next week. Do you have a couple of days for me?

504
01:07:28,200 --> 01:07:30,680
The president wants to welcome his new designer.

505
01:07:32,840 --> 01:07:35,480
For the president I’m always free for him.

506
01:07:41,800 --> 01:07:42,600
But…

507
01:07:44,440 --> 01:07:46,320
Can we go just two of us?

508
01:07:53,880 --> 01:07:54,680
Of course!

509
01:07:58,000 --> 01:07:58,800
As in now?

510
01:07:59,800 --> 01:08:02,600
Khin Dad, I haven’t said goodbye to my friends yet.
