1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:10,960
I like you.

2
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:16,920
I think I need to show you something at my home.

3
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,160
This is a painting of Lord Phaya Suriyen.

4
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:23,320
I think I will send this design to compete in the world jewelry event.

5
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:25,320
Madame Wang, what do you think about my design?

6
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,200
It’s the most powerful design I have ever seen in my life.

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,400
Looks, this is the latest version of my design.

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:33,960
Do you like it?

9
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:41,840
It looks so beautiful. I feel so enchanted just by looking at it.

10
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:44,480
So this is the one that you’re going to send to the world jewelry event?

11
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:45,840
Yes.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:50,280
If you don’t like anything about this you can tell me.

13
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,560
I actually don’t mind the design at all. Although there’s one thing.

14
00:00:57,160 --> 00:00:58,600
So do you mind or you don’t mind?

15
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:00,320
Of corse, I do.

16
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:00,960
What about it?

17
00:01:01,400 --> 00:01:02,040
Yeah, what’s the problem?

18
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:06,160
Well, P'Prim is already done with 3D Drafting.

19
00:01:07,960 --> 00:01:10,160
If we ask her to do the 3D version of this new one right now

20
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:11,200
I don’t think she’ll be available for us.

21
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:12,800
You’re right.

22
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:15,720
What should we do then? We have to turn this in for the production now.

23
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:18,320
Can we get this done in time though?

24
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:21,400
What can we do?

25
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:25,800
Honestly, which ones do you guys prefer?

26
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,800
I’m going to be honest. I like this one more.

27
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,400
It’s giving me such a powerful yet mysterious feeling.

28
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:37,840
I like this one more as well.

29
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:40,640
I really like this one too.

30
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:42,479
Okay?

31
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:43,880
What should we do then?

32
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:47,880
We all really like this one

33
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:50,360
but who can help us with the 3D thing?

34
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:55,800
Everyone in our department seems so busy right now.

35
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:58,840
Right.

36
00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:02,040
I have the best idea.

37
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,520
Tell me please.

38
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:12,560
There’s only one in our department that seems to always have a lot of spare time.

39
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:25,160
See! Come on! Come! Come!

40
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:32,079
What are you talking about? Keep doing your job!

41
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:39,760
Is this…

42
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:42,400
The snack that you want to eat.

43
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,280
Why would you bring it here?

44
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,400
Is it for me?

45
00:03:54,760 --> 00:04:00,840
Us three bought this and really want to give it to you.

46
00:04:01,160 --> 00:04:03,760
Since you’ve been working non-stop lately.

47
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,200
I mean…

48
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,560
I’ve been eating this everyday. I’m getting bored of them.

49
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:14,080
I don’t want to eat this anymore.

50
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:18,720
If you don’t want this

51
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,959
then I will eat it.

52
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,520
Hey! Stop now! Wait!

53
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:24,680
Yes?

54
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,520
Since Salin already bought this one for me

55
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:33,360
it would be inconsiderate of me to say no to your kindness.

56
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,600
So I will just take it.

57
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:42,760
Next time we’ll buy you so much more, okay?

58
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,600
I’d like that.

59
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,080
Although we have to ask you for something.

60
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:55,120
I mean… We would like you to help us with our 3D design.

61
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,440
What!? A 3D design?

62
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,040
Can’t you see how much work I have?

63
00:05:03,040 --> 00:05:06,640
I have work that need to get due by minutes even by seconds

64
00:05:06,640 --> 00:05:07,840
and also in weeks after weeks.

65
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:11,080
My hands are all tied. I don't think I can’t really help you with that.

66
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:12,280
Go find someone else to help you with that!

67
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:13,120
P’Jul!

68
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:13,960
You need someone else!

69
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:16,720
Should we follow him?

70
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,080
We should! Let’s go!

71
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:24,640
Poor my handsome Juladis.

72
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,120
Can you listen to us please?

73
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:27,840
That’s right.

74
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,680
Please?

75
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:36,080
I think it’s time that you need to change your computer now.

76
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:41,520
Wouldn't it be better if you get an update to a better, faster and newer one?

77
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:43,480
Doesn’t it sound great?

78
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:45,159
That’s right, Pim.

79
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,159
This one is all dusty now.

80
00:05:48,159 --> 00:05:50,880
I don’t want that. It still works fine for me.

81
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:53,120
I’va been using this for many years now and I haven’t had any problems with it.

82
00:05:53,159 --> 00:05:55,800
I can work with this one just fine.

83
00:05:58,480 --> 00:05:59,520
P’Juladis How about this?

84
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:06,040
I would delete the scandalous video between you and P’Chan on my phone.

85
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:11,480
Yotha! Shh!

86
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,560
It’s such a cutie video.

87
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,200
I really like it as well.

88
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:20,280
This scene is super…

89
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,480
I really like this one too. It looks just as they are acting.

90
00:06:26,120 --> 00:06:29,400
Well, actually, I think I got some time.

91
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:36,280
Right! You all just send me your file and I will do that for you.

92
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:38,760
Satisfy now?

93
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,159
Thank you so much we’ll be in huge trouble without you.

94
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:50,040
Thank you so much!

95
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:52,320
Please help me with that.

96
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:54,200
Right. I’ll check it out.

97
00:06:58,360 --> 00:07:01,400
About that video, I think you should get rid of it now.

98
00:07:01,920 --> 00:07:04,720
I don’t want the video to go around and other people will see.

99
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,040
Oops! I accidentally pressed share to the group chat.

100
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:11,800
Yotha!

101
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,120
I was just messing with you.

102
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:15,360
I don’t want anyone to see that.

103
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:17,560
Yo, stop messing with him.

104
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:18,720
Sorry for his behavior.

105
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:19,640
All right. Just leave!

106
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,159
I like you.

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,680
Actually, I want…

108
00:07:46,880 --> 00:07:49,400
You’re here? I’ve been looking for you.

109
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:51,640
I thought that you went home already.

110
00:07:53,600 --> 00:07:54,680
Why don’t you sit at your own desk?

111
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:58,880
I’m too lazy to go up the stairs.

112
00:08:01,040 --> 00:08:03,480
Do you want me to believe that?

113
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,040
Come on, tell me. What’s wrong?

114
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:11,640
It’s nothing, just sitting here makes me think clearer.

115
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,840
Khun Prim, the work that you asked me to do.

116
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:26,800
I almost died to get it done.

117
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:31,440
Although I get it done without any issues, no matter how hard it is.

118
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:33,280
Can you please check that for me?

119
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:35,640
Where are you going?

120
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,720
Going home.

121
00:08:42,559 --> 00:08:45,000
You’re going home as soon as I get here. What a pain!

122
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:49,640
Khun Prim, this work took me three nights and days.

123
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:51,960
I haven’t been sleeping very well for a few days now.

124
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:01,200
There must be something going on.

125
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:04,240
Hey! Yotha, the intern.

126
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:05,640
Hello?

127
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,040
You sound guilty! What are you doing late at night?

128
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:11,000
I’m on my way back home now.

129
00:09:11,520 --> 00:09:16,640
Do you know how much they spend on the electricity bill monthly?

130
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:25,400
Pim.

131
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,160
Pim!

132
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:29,800
Wait for me, Pim.

133
00:09:34,880 --> 00:09:37,920
I haven’t seen you at all today. Are you avoiding me?

134
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:41,920
Everything’s fine.

135
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:44,320
I’m just changing the atmosphere today.

136
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:48,080
So you’re avoiding me.

137
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,240
No! It’s not that.

138
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,160
Are you upset at me about what I told you yesterday?

139
00:10:01,640 --> 00:10:02,760
I’m sorry then.

140
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,040
I am really sorry but I couldn't keep it in anymore.

141
00:10:12,760 --> 00:10:13,560
P’Prim.

142
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,360
Can you at least say something?

143
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,360
It’s just…

144
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:37,880
I just don’t know how to behave around you anymore.

145
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,760
Also I’ve never kissed anyone before.

146
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:48,040
I was just pretending like I know it all.

147
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,200
I figured!

148
00:10:59,560 --> 00:11:00,360
Let's make up?

149
00:11:07,320 --> 00:11:10,200
Honestly, I’m not mad at you or anything.

150
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:14,680
I am just…

151
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,240
I am just afraid that it wasn’t a good kiss.

152
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:30,760
About that… I can teach you.

153
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:37,120
Or do you want me to teach you now?

154
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:48,360
You seem to enjoy it when I teach you stuff.

155
00:11:52,360 --> 00:11:53,920
I think you can teach me about this later.

156
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:56,320
But I want to do it now.

157
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:48,760
Come in.

158
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,600
Yo.

159
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:58,640
I bought dinner.

160
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:00,240
Why are you not home?

161
00:13:01,320 --> 00:13:02,400
You’re not home as well.

162
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:05,160
Are you waiting because you want to go home together?

163
00:13:12,280 --> 00:13:16,520
No! It’s just that I've been seeing you eating those nutritionless snacks.

164
00:13:16,600 --> 00:13:19,280
So I bought you dinner. What to eat now?

165
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:22,600
You’re worried about me, aren’t you?

166
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:33,480
What a cute boyfriend I have.

167
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,320
But you’ll be cuter if you call me P’Sam

168
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:40,680
Frankly, I’m older than you.

169
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:44,320
Really! Why do I have to call you that?

170
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:45,800
Are you out of your mind?

171
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,640
I’m leaving now.

172
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:50,640
Why are you rushing back just now?

173
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:59,920
But P’Sam have been thinking about you all day.

174
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:05,080
Since Nong Yo is here with me now I will not let you go easily.

175
00:14:14,840 --> 00:14:15,640
I really have to go.

176
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:19,160
I won’t let you go.

177
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,440
Let me go.

178
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,160
I will not. I won’t!

179
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,160
Let me hug you first.

180
00:14:27,480 --> 00:14:28,560
If you want me to let you go,

181
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:33,320
you have to call me P’Sam then I’ll let you go.

182
00:14:35,360 --> 00:14:36,160
Fine!

183
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:41,800
P’Sam… Will you please let Yotha go home?

184
00:14:43,240 --> 00:14:44,040
Okay, I’ll let you go.

185
00:14:45,840 --> 00:14:47,840
Well, why don’t you go?

186
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:50,600
Or do you…

187
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,640
Let’s just have dinner.

188
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
We can have dinner anytime

189
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:02,040
but now…

190
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,480
I want to have you first.

191
00:15:11,960 --> 00:15:12,760
Wait?

192
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:13,920
What?

193
00:15:15,280 --> 00:15:16,360
What are you going to do?

194
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:48,120
Wow! This is amazing.

195
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:48,840
Really?

196
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,280
Gorgeous!

197
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:52,360
Gracias!

198
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:53,960
Is it really that good?

199
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:56,640
I love it! It looks great!

200
00:17:56,640 --> 00:17:58,120
Very nice!

201
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,960
If it wasn’t for you our 3D design wouldn’t look this good.

202
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,960
No need to give me compliments.

203
00:18:07,160 --> 00:18:14,040
Anything that was done by me wouldn't be so ordinary looking.

204
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:22,760
I don’t want to brag but whatever I touched it always turned out so amazing.

205
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:25,240
And also perfect just like this one.

206
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,080
I couldn’t agree more.

207
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:29,280
Why am I such a talented person?

208
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,040
I think you should send this in now.

209
00:18:32,520 --> 00:18:34,720
I’m just going to save it now then.

210
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,520
Okay.

211
00:18:36,560 --> 00:18:37,920
What are you all looking at?

212
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,000
We’re looking at the new design of Salin that he’ll use to compete in the world jewelry event.

213
00:18:43,400 --> 00:18:45,120
He’s about to send this in now.

214
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:48,000
A new design! It’s too late now.

215
00:18:48,120 --> 00:18:51,040
I’ve already sent all of your designs.

216
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,000
But P’Kaew don’t we have another day left?

217
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,400
The thing is I’ve already sent all the files already.

218
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:03,360
It’s going to waste my time if I have to handle all of these again.

219
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:08,240
Not to mention that the old design that you sent is already looking good.

220
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:15,480
Actually it’s your fault that you haven’t told her that you were going to change your design.

221
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,640
And that might waste her time even more.

222
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:23,480
I’m really sorry, P’Kaew but I really want to do my best.

223
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,560
P’kaew, but the thing is

224
00:19:26,120 --> 00:19:30,440
After I looked at his new design I think that it is far more interesting than the old one.

225
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,520
He adapted a few things here and there.

226
00:19:32,520 --> 00:19:35,160
Would you mind having another look?

227
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:36,520
New design?

228
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:37,840
Here you go.

229
00:19:38,480 --> 00:19:40,560
Take a look here.

230
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:44,720
This is the one?

231
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,680
That’s right.

232
00:19:46,160 --> 00:19:48,280
Since we’re doing all of these for the company,

233
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:51,720
I want you to talk with them about sending this one in.

234
00:19:53,720 --> 00:19:57,600
Alright, I will talk with them later.

235
00:19:58,520 --> 00:19:59,680
Thank you so much, P’Kaew.

236
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:03,240
Is this 3D design already saved?

237
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:04,840
I did. It's the drive now.

238
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:09,040
So I’ll just take this 3D now.

239
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,760
Okay.

240
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:17,120
I’m sorry again if this may cause you any inconvenience.

241
00:20:18,000 --> 00:20:20,040
It’s fine, I’ll have a chat with them.

242
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,800
Thank you, P’Kaew.

243
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:00,520
Lin Lin has brought you your drinks!

244
00:21:02,840 --> 00:21:03,640
Here.

245
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,720
Yo, why don’t you help him?

246
00:21:07,720 --> 00:21:08,560
That’s right.

247
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:10,640
Well, you didn’t ask for my help.

248
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:14,600
Mango smoothie for P’Prim.

249
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:16,360
Thanks.

250
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:17,440
This is for Pim.

251
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:24,400
I want to thank P’Prim for helping us earlier.

252
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:31,280
And I would like to say sorry as well for the fact that I changed the plan so suddenly.

253
00:21:32,280 --> 00:21:34,840
It’s not something that you need to apologize for.

254
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:38,520
Just live your lives and do your best at work.

255
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,360
Don’t feel guilty about it.

256
00:21:42,360 --> 00:21:48,680
You’re the best! My heart was so trembling.

257
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,160
I thought that Lin had worked so hard for nothing.

258
00:21:53,840 --> 00:21:57,560
Wow! Not only P’Prim is good at your work

259
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,840
but you are also good at convincing people.

260
00:21:59,840 --> 00:22:02,560
I’m floating with happiness!

261
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,520
Don’t worry I’m holding on to you.

262
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,560
I will never let you float away.

263
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:27,160
Gossip time! Since when?

264
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,240
I’m as clueless as you are.

265
00:22:28,520 --> 00:22:30,600
They look so sweet together.

266
00:22:31,680 --> 00:22:33,160
Sweet as honey.

267
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:35,840
My mango smoothie is worthless at this point.

268
00:22:36,760 --> 00:22:38,280
Have a look at P’Jul,

269
00:22:39,560 --> 00:22:41,840
do you think that he’s jealous of their love or that he wants to eat mt smoothie?

270
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:44,000
I think the latter one.

271
00:22:44,840 --> 00:22:45,840
Oh! We didn’t buy any for him?

272
00:22:48,440 --> 00:22:49,200
What are you doing?

273
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,560
P’Jul, I bought this one myself. Why don’t we share it?

274
00:22:54,920 --> 00:22:59,720
Yo, you drank like half of it already. I better get it myself if I want.

275
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,200
Hello, everyone.

276
00:23:17,560 --> 00:23:22,080
We’re all here today to vote on the most promising design.

277
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,640
As you guys can see I already had all the designs in front of you.

278
00:23:25,040 --> 00:23:27,640
The designs will be produced into jewelry piece

279
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:32,400
and we will send it to compete in the biggest jewelry event of the year, the world jewelry.

280
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:34,560
Let’s not waste anymore time here,

281
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,040
all of the judges can start voting from now on.

282
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:59,640
Oh my god! I didn’t expect us to win again.

283
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,520
Ways to go!

284
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:07,320
Thanks.

285
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:09,520
The judges really know their stuff.

286
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,480
I would like to congratulate you guys on your very first step of success.

287
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:19,560
Thanks!

288
00:25:20,200 --> 00:25:24,240
It was worth all the sleepless nights

289
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:28,240
that I put in for your 3D design.

290
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,880
We did an amazing job with these interns!

291
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:37,720
After all the blood, sweat, and tears I put into training you guys,

292
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:40,240
it's worth it to see you all turn out this talented.

293
00:25:40,320 --> 00:25:42,080
Really?

294
00:25:43,240 --> 00:25:45,680
Stop! They are good on their own.

295
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:51,640
That’s not it. Actually we have to thank all of you.

296
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:54,640
If it wasn’t for you all we might not be chosen.

297
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,960
We have to thank my P’Prim too.

298
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:06,560
I mean our P’Prim for talking with P’Kaewmanee for us.

299
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:11,080
Or else our design will not reach the judge panel.

300
00:26:12,000 --> 00:26:15,760
She’s so cool. Isn’t she?

301
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,080
P’Prim! Have you heard the news?

302
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,320
About Salin right?

303
00:26:32,280 --> 00:26:34,520
Thank you so much. Without you,

304
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,000
we weren’t to be chosen.

305
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:39,280
Right!

306
00:26:39,280 --> 00:26:39,840
True!

307
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:51,480
Actually, I have something to tell you guys as well.

308
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,240
Salin’s design has already been patented.

309
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:13,400
Who dares to do this?

310
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:17,520
I don’t know.

311
00:27:19,280 --> 00:27:20,320
What it this?

312
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,720
How is this happening again?

313
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,440
Thank you su much.

314
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:35,880
You’re very welcome.

315
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,760
Thank you.

316
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,000
Don’t forget what we talked about.

317
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:44,480
The design is so beautiful.

318
00:27:47,720 --> 00:27:49,680
What? Really?

319
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,760
What happened?

320
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:08,280
The design has already been patented.

321
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,640
If we didn’t do this then who did this?

322
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:31,320
The romantic of northern lights from norway

323
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:37,480
will absolutely make Salin keep falling for you over and over again.

324
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:46,360
You’re picking a tour package or something?

325
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:49,520
You seem to be happy.

326
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,920
There’s a problem now.

327
00:28:52,160 --> 00:28:54,840
That’s right. We’re having a really huge problem.

328
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:57,400
Clam down.

329
00:28:58,520 --> 00:28:59,680
What’s happening?

330
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,280
Why don’t you guys just cut to the chase now?

331
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,000
The design that got chosen to compete in the world jewelry

332
00:29:05,920 --> 00:29:07,520
has already been patented.

333
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:14,400
Right. About that?

334
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,440
I had that patented myself.

335
00:29:24,680 --> 00:29:28,400
Here, the design now belongs to Soul Jewelry.

336
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:32,320
You guys must’ve checked it so thoroughly.

337
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:40,960
Wow! I’m amazed by how enthusiastic you guys are.

338
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,560
If you guys have no business here now,

339
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:52,360
may I go back to look at my tour packages?

340
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:57,640
Please leave.

341
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:08,160
The president has such sharp foresight! He’s truly perfect for the position.

342
00:30:09,880 --> 00:30:11,720
I thought that you might have missed your opportunity like last time.

343
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,040
Who is it that keeps stealing the designs from Soul?

344
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:19,600
The president is so clever that he’s able to catch on these people.

345
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:20,680
You’re right.

346
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:23,960
He decided to patent the design even before the results came out.

347
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:25,480
He must’ve known beforehand that things like this will happen.

348
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:26,160
Agreed!

349
00:30:30,200 --> 00:30:32,840
Huh! You scared the crap out of me!

350
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,600
Why didn’t you tell me before?

351
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:36,320
I have no idea about that either.

352
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,840
That’s right Your work could be stolen again.

353
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:43,400
Good thing that the president has saved you heroically.

354
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:46,440
If not I might have a heart attack.

355
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,200
He’ll see if he dares not to help me.

356
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,280
Ahh.. Our president is such an unrealistic human being.

357
00:30:53,120 --> 00:31:01,320
He’s handsome like a creation of god and he’s also so clever as well.

358
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:05,360
Hahaha! I'm so impressed by him.

359
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:25,480
Wow! look at the secretary of the president is no less than the president.

360
00:31:26,120 --> 00:31:27,920
He got something good himself.

361
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,120
I would like to thank all of you for your dedication

362
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:36,840
Into producing such amazing work.

363
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:41,680
But today I have an announcement to make.

364
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,320
Salin will act as a representative of Soul

365
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,000
to walk down the catwalk in the upcoming world jewelry.

366
00:32:01,080 --> 00:32:02,240
Amazing!

367
00:32:02,680 --> 00:32:06,400
Our Lin will shine internationally.

368
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:07,600
So amazing!

369
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:12,560
President, I think the event is too big.

370
00:32:12,760 --> 00:32:15,080
I think it would be better to use a professional model.

371
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:17,720
Chan?

372
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:32,360
As you can see,

373
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:35,120
after the launched this collection of Amaraporn,

374
00:32:35,800 --> 00:32:36,920
they sold out so fast within minutes.

375
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:40,000
So does everybody agree?

376
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:43,880
If Salin will walk down the runway for soul.

377
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,000
Totally agree!/Couldn't agree more

378
00:32:46,360 --> 00:32:47,160
Agreed!

379
00:32:48,880 --> 00:32:50,800
I’m so proud of you.

380
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:01,800
Yes, Khun Chen.

381
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:04,160
I already fixed the design for you.

382
00:33:04,520 --> 00:33:06,120
I’m on my way to see you now.

383
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:07,440
See you soon.

384
00:33:07,920 --> 00:33:08,960
Right.

385
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,760
Yes?

386
00:34:02,520 --> 00:34:03,760
I don’t care if it’s already been patented.

387
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,720
My client just wants to be the first to have that design.

388
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,920
And the amount of money that I offer.

389
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,159
I think it should be enough.

390
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:25,040
The client has already transferred some down payment.

391
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,199
Please check your account.

392
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,159
If this is not a success

393
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:33,199
you can just hold on to that money.

394
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,840
I don’t think that there will be any problem.

395
00:35:50,520 --> 00:35:52,360
JC is willing to pay us 10 million.

396
00:35:52,800 --> 00:35:55,560
Wow! That is so much more than we anticipated.

397
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,200
Right.

398
00:35:57,640 --> 00:35:59,440
Although you have to do every way in you power

399
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:03,840
to make that jewelry unable to display in the world jewelry event.

400
00:36:05,520 --> 00:36:06,880
I can do anything?

401
00:36:07,720 --> 00:36:09,160
Yeah, anything.

402
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:14,600
So?

403
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:19,840
But that amount of money can help your family tremendously.

404
00:36:25,560 --> 00:36:29,480
Then I would like another 10 percent more from that money.

405
00:36:29,480 --> 00:36:30,400
No problem.

406
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:35,880
Once I become the president, you’ll get so much more.

407
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:45,280
Are you certain?

408
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:50,400
Bro! If i’m not sure about something

409
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,080
then I won’t say it at all.

410
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,240
Should we take care of them now?

411
00:36:59,080 --> 00:36:59,880
Just let them be for now.

412
00:37:01,040 --> 00:37:02,040
Even though that we’re so sure about this

413
00:37:02,720 --> 00:37:04,040
but we have no evidence at all.

414
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,680
Bro! But what if they did it successfully?

415
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:12,880
That’s exactly what we want. We have to lure them to start the plan.

416
00:37:15,880 --> 00:37:17,520
Isn’t that too risky?

417
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,520
This is what we have to to,

418
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,200
in order to get rid of them completely.

419
00:37:38,440 --> 00:37:42,200
Oh! You’re serious about it like you’re a model yourself.

420
00:37:42,520 --> 00:37:43,320
Isn’t it too much?

421
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:46,640
It’s like my own son will be going to the world jewelry,

422
00:37:47,360 --> 00:37:49,120
I can’t let anyone outshine him.

423
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:51,920
Lin!

424
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:56,080
Do you have any idea what kind of costume would go perfectly with jewelry?

425
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:02,320
I think it's more like a casual one.

426
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:04,360
Not too over the top,

427
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:07,160
but there must be something special about it.

428
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,240
Uhm…

429
00:38:09,360 --> 00:38:10,240
But there must be like a wow factor

430
00:38:10,480 --> 00:38:14,240
when people look at it and it’s like shine bright like a diamond.

431
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,280
So it would be memorable for people.

432
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:21,520
I think I will draw it for you then.

433
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:25,200
If you see and which one you like more then I’ll go with it.

434
00:38:25,560 --> 00:38:27,000
You’re like a pro at these things anyway.

435
00:38:29,160 --> 00:38:30,440
You can trust me.

436
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:33,200
Looks like you’re floating with happiness.

437
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:35,720
I’m floating because I’m an angel!

438
00:38:38,280 --> 00:38:39,600
Which one do you like more?

439
00:38:45,600 --> 00:38:46,400
Guys!

440
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,520
I have the costume.

441
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,120
Let me have a look!

442
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,800
Wow! Shine bright like a diamond as you want.

443
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,280
How did you get this?

444
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:05,960
Khun Dad…

445
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:08,880
I mean P’Sun.

446
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:11,560
P’Sun!

447
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,640
It looks so stunning!

448
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:20,880
Hey! Are you trying to go through my chat?

449
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:22,720
I’m not!

450
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,400
And now…

451
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,840
that left us with one more thing to do.

452
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:30,760
What?

453
00:39:31,280 --> 00:39:32,480
A catwalk.

454
00:39:34,120 --> 00:39:34,920
You’re right!

455
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,640
What should we do? I have never done that!

456
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:50,120
Well! Since I’ve been attending the world jewelry event for many years.

457
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,520
I’ve gathered many experiences from that.

458
00:39:55,880 --> 00:40:00,400
You are going to run into many famous people.

459
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:06,320
And not only that but Selenena and Sean will attend the event as well.

460
00:40:07,240 --> 00:40:09,280
So everything must be perfect.

461
00:40:18,480 --> 00:40:19,800
P’Jul

462
00:40:19,800 --> 00:40:20,400
Yes?

463
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:25,600
I’ve never walked on a runway before. Who should I channel myself into?

464
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:27,640
No need to do that.

465
00:40:28,040 --> 00:40:31,320
You don’t have to worry about doing the catwalk because that is not hard.

466
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:38,600
But I will teach you a secret on how to captivate people's hearts.

467
00:40:39,360 --> 00:40:40,160
Wow! You’re good as expected.

468
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:46,840
But I’m not surprised since you’re the boyfriend of Chan, the secretary of the president.

469
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,640
Yo! You’re keep teasing me many times now

470
00:40:57,080 --> 00:41:00,160
Then please help me with that.

471
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,560
Pleasure! It’s nothing.

472
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,880
Well teh should we start practising now?

473
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:08,880
As in right now?

474
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:09,640
Yes?

475
00:41:09,640 --> 00:41:10,400
At this moment?

476
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:12,240
Yes! Let’s go.

477
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:16,280
What are you waiting for?

478
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:19,720
You got this. We're always here for you.

479
00:41:20,320 --> 00:41:20,840
Go get it!

480
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:22,280
Come!

481
00:41:23,280 --> 00:41:25,680
The least you'll just die. It’s okay.

482
00:41:27,560 --> 00:41:33,120
Music Cue!

483
00:41:46,000 --> 00:41:46,800
Clap your hands!

484
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:49,240
Don’t be shy.

485
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,600
Do I really have to walk like that?

486
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:52,960
Why don’t you give it a try?

487
00:41:53,640 --> 00:41:54,720
I think you can do this.

488
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,600
Just don’t talk and go with it.

489
00:41:57,200 --> 00:42:00,480
You have to walk a little lopsided. You might be able to adapt this technique.

490
00:42:01,880 --> 00:42:02,640
If you’re ready then go!

491
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:19,080
Don’t look at the floor! Look straight forward!

492
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:20,440
Counting one and…

493
00:42:31,360 --> 00:42:33,080
You have to show off your hips like this.

494
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:35,040
Use your hip more!

495
00:42:41,840 --> 00:42:42,600
What are they doing?

496
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:45,400
P’Prim!

497
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,640
P’Jul is teaching Lin how to walk on a runway.

498
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:50,560
Him teaching?

499
00:42:58,840 --> 00:43:00,000
You can do this!

500
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:11,440
Very fierce! My love!

501
00:43:17,320 --> 00:43:18,480
Everybody claps your hands!

502
00:43:22,120 --> 00:43:25,040
I’m tearing up now, I’m so proud of you.

503
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,840
Wait? Are we going to use this song on the actual day?

504
00:43:29,320 --> 00:43:30,160
Of course, not.

505
00:43:30,800 --> 00:43:31,640
It’s going to be a slower song.

506
00:43:33,880 --> 00:43:34,960
So why is he teaching this song?

507
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,360
You must be waiting for so long.

508
00:44:15,520 --> 00:44:21,480
It’s not that long. I waited for you for 30 years of my life before.

509
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:24,440
Why are you being so sweet today?

510
00:44:28,640 --> 00:44:29,680
How is your work today?

511
00:44:30,120 --> 00:44:30,920
Did you have fun working?

512
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,480
It was fun but also stressful.

513
00:44:36,480 --> 00:44:38,000
The world jewelry event is getting close.

514
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:42,000
Ahh. right, it was close.

515
00:44:42,840 --> 00:44:44,160
How about the necklace? Is it done now?

516
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,680
I think it will be done tomorrow.

517
00:44:45,960 --> 00:44:47,760
I think I’ll go get it after work.

518
00:44:49,360 --> 00:44:52,080
I think I’ll go get it for you then we’ll see each other at home, okay?

519
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:55,840
No, that’s fine. I want to see it with my own eyes.

520
00:44:57,160 --> 00:44:58,080
It’s quite far.

521
00:44:58,800 --> 00:45:00,040
Don’t you trust me?

522
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:02,600
I do trust you

523
00:45:03,040 --> 00:45:05,520
but still I want to check it myself.

524
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:08,080
Just in case there is a mistake or something.

525
00:45:09,560 --> 00:45:12,320
If you really trust me then let me go and get it.

526
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:13,600
Don’t be stubborn, okay?

527
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:18,080
How about this?

528
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,360
Why don’t we go and get it together?

529
00:45:21,560 --> 00:45:28,280
Huh? Alright.

530
00:45:29,440 --> 00:45:31,160
Then tomorrow once you get off of your work,

531
00:45:31,720 --> 00:45:32,800
wait for me just a little bit, okay?

532
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,600
I have a meeting with my partner.

533
00:45:35,600 --> 00:45:38,240
Alright! Once I’m off work I’ll call you.

534
00:45:38,480 --> 00:45:39,040
Okay.

535
00:45:39,360 --> 00:45:39,880
Deal!

536
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:43,160
I think we should get change now?

537
00:45:45,360 --> 00:45:46,440
Why do we have to change our clothes? Where are we going?

538
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:53,280
I know that you’ve been very stress so

539
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,640
So I want you to brush off the dress with me.

540
00:45:58,320 --> 00:45:59,120
Brush off the stress?

541
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:06,840
See you guys tomorrow!

542
00:50:07,160 --> 00:50:08,440
Goodbye/Bye bye.

543
00:50:08,440 --> 00:50:09,840
I have dinner to go to.

544
00:50:10,080 --> 00:50:10,840
Bye!

545
00:50:11,280 --> 00:50:12,360
Goodbye!

546
00:50:20,200 --> 00:50:20,920
Hello, yes?

547
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:26,160
The jewelry is ready. When are you going to pick it up?

548
00:50:26,320 --> 00:50:29,040
Thank you so much. I’ll head there as soon as possible.

549
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:31,080
Good bye.

550
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:34,880
Guys I have great news.

551
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:36,640
Is it done?

552
00:50:36,960 --> 00:50:37,600
Yeah!

553
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,280
Want to see it together?

554
00:50:41,640 --> 00:50:45,080
I’d love to but…

555
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:48,280
Right…

556
00:50:51,560 --> 00:50:52,240
Are you ready?

557
00:50:52,760 --> 00:50:53,480
Yes!

558
00:50:54,080 --> 00:50:58,600
You’re here picking her up from a meeting room now.

559
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:01,040
Where are you going?

560
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:02,880
We’re going to eat some dumplings.

561
00:51:04,720 --> 00:51:05,680
Pork dumplings right?

562
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:07,280
Yeah, my fav!

563
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:09,400
Thank you.

564
00:51:09,960 --> 00:51:11,680
Please take care of her for me.

565
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:12,240
Of course.

566
00:51:12,560 --> 00:51:13,360
She will.

567
00:51:14,840 --> 00:51:15,920
Good bye !

568
00:51:18,200 --> 00:51:18,800
Shall we go now, Yo?

569
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:22,240
I have an appointment now.

570
00:51:22,880 --> 00:51:23,600
Really?

571
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,000
With who?

572
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:26,200
Well.

573
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,920
You know who.

574
00:51:32,120 --> 00:51:33,800
Don’t you want to come together?

575
00:51:34,360 --> 00:51:35,160
Erm…

576
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:40,920
I want to. Should I cancel my appointment?

577
00:51:40,920 --> 00:51:42,160
Stop it. No need to do that.

578
00:51:42,960 --> 00:51:44,800
You two haven’t really much time together.

579
00:51:45,040 --> 00:51:47,040
You should go. Don’t waste anymore time here.

580
00:51:48,200 --> 00:51:50,080
I can go there with P’Sun.

581
00:51:50,320 --> 00:51:51,160
Are you sure about this?

582
00:51:52,440 --> 00:51:53,000
Are you for real?

583
00:51:53,040 --> 00:51:53,600
I am.

584
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:55,120
Wait, help me with one thing.

585
00:51:55,760 --> 00:51:58,240
Can I leave this with you?

586
00:51:59,120 --> 00:51:59,520
Of course.

587
00:51:59,800 --> 00:52:01,720
You can put this on the table in the living room.

588
00:52:02,320 --> 00:52:02,800
Okay.

589
00:52:03,680 --> 00:52:05,520
Then I’m leaving now. Thanks again.

590
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,160
Bye bye!

591
00:52:06,360 --> 00:52:06,920
Bye bye!

592
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:08,160
Wait!

593
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:10,040
Are you sure that I’m not needed there?

594
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:11,200
I’m sure.

595
00:52:28,600 --> 00:52:31,480
This is the report.

596
00:52:37,240 --> 00:52:39,360
He must be still in the meeting.

597
00:52:40,640 --> 00:52:42,960
Phew! What should I do?

598
00:52:44,520 --> 00:52:45,320
I’ll just go there by myself.

599
00:54:06,560 --> 00:54:08,960
Is he still in the meeting?

600
00:54:16,560 --> 00:54:17,800
Why am I having such a bad headache now?

601
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,200
If it wasn’t for you then it is still a secret.

602
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:03,480
You’re still as bright as a ray of sunshine just like I remember, Salin.
