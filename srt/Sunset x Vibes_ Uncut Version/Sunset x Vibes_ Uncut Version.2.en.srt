1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:07,240
Today is the first day of your internship.

2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:07,680
Lin,

3
00:00:08,039 --> 00:00:08,840
you can do it.

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:11,520
This is our design department.

5
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,200
Ready?

6
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:13,080
Ready!

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,880
I want all of you to cooperate with our new president.

8
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:19,560
My own son.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,840
You’ve been talking with him for a while.

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:24,520
Have you two met in person yet?

11
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:26,760
Where did P’Sun ask you to go?

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:31,080
Excuse me, I’m a guest of Mr.Sun.

13
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:34,560
You could go and wait in a room that we prepared.

14
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:05,600
We’re about to meet,

15
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:06,880
Nu-Lin.

16
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,840
P’Sun..

17
00:01:34,759 --> 00:01:35,560
Have you been waiting long ?

18
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:38,080
Nu-Lin.

19
00:02:52,079 --> 00:02:52,920
Is everything alright?

20
00:02:55,240 --> 00:02:56,120
You don’t like it here?

21
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:57,440
No, it’s not that.

22
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,200
Er..

23
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,960
I’m just a little bit surprised.

24
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:02,560
What’s wrong?

25
00:03:02,680 --> 00:03:03,560
Why aren’t there

26
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,600
anyone else?

27
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,560
There’s only us here.

28
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:13,480
Ah,

29
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:16,680
I think

30
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:19,160
they might be sitting in other areas.

31
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:23,880
There are many zones here.

32
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:25,800
Yeah

33
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,280
Er..

34
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,960
Henestly,

35
00:03:28,960 --> 00:03:30,600
you don’t have to take me to

36
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:32,440
such a fancy restaurant like this one.

37
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,920
You told me that you are just an ordinary office worker.

38
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,680
I don’t want to cause any trouble financially.

39
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:46,760
I want to make a good impression on our first date

40
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,600
and also

41
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:53,560
I want you to enjoy it.

42
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:56,560
Thank you.

43
00:03:58,800 --> 00:03:59,400
Today,

44
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,520
can I share the bill?

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:02,840
No,

46
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,920
I got it.

47
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:04,920
I can take care of you.

48
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:06,440
No, it’s fine.

49
00:04:07,160 --> 00:04:08,680
If you run out of money,

50
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,560
we might not be able to

51
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,280
see each other very often.

52
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:18,440
Okay?

53
00:04:18,920 --> 00:04:19,519
Alright,

54
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,160
if you’re okay with that

55
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:23,160
then I’m okay as well.

56
00:04:23,920 --> 00:04:24,480
Deal!

57
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:26,880
Should we eat now?

58
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:27,640
Let’s eat.

59
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:32,840
Thank you.

60
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:34,440
So,

61
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:36,960
how’s it going at work?

62
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:39,080
Any better?

63
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,400
It wasn’t

64
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,560
but,

65
00:04:43,760 --> 00:04:44,880
now that I work there for a while,

66
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,520
it is getting better.

67
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,000
I’m getting close to doing what I am actually good at.

68
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:51,840
See!

69
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,880
I told you things will get better.

70
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:57,360
Fighting!

71
00:04:58,240 --> 00:04:59,040
Thank you.

72
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:16,240
P’Sun,

73
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:20,560
once we’re done here

74
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,760
what should we do next?

75
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,400
I know that you’ve been quite stress lately

76
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:38,200
so I might’ve prepared something for you.

77
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:43,720
I want you to be relaxed.

78
00:06:05,480 --> 00:06:07,360
Why isn’t Lin coming down just yet?

79
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,200
Yo, you need to give him some time.

80
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,200
He's going on a date.

81
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:13,840
I think it’s a little long.

82
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:16,640
It’s probably nothing.

83
00:06:17,480 --> 00:06:18,240
Shut up!

84
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:20,480
Argh,

85
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,400
why is your boyfriend's car so hot?

86
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,920
You should look at what you’re wearing.

87
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,200
You should be thankful that he let us borrow his car.

88
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,280
Maybe,

89
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:32,880
Lin and P’Sun

90
00:06:33,200 --> 00:06:35,040
are doing….

91
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,040
Mwah!

92
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,360
I can’t stand no more!

93
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,440
Yo!

94
00:06:48,440 --> 00:06:48,800
Yo!

95
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:49,280
Wait!

96
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:51,120
Yo!

97
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,000
Wait! Yo!

98
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:55,400
Excuse me,

99
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:56,640
where is the dining room?

100
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:00,040
Yo Yo Yo

101
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:03,120
I’m sorry but our VIP customer has reserved it already.

102
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,240
Let me try.

103
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:07,240
I’m sorry but

104
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,600
I’m a friend of one of the guests inside.

105
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,720
We’re just worried about our friend's safety so we just want to check it out.

106
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,440
I’m sorry, but we can’t allow that

107
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:16,880
due to the privacy and the security of our guests here.

108
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:20,200
My friend is a guest here.

109
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:21,480
Why can’t I get it?

110
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:23,280
My friend

111
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:25,320
might be in danger right now.

112
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,400
I can’t really allow that.

113
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,920
Didn’t you hear that my friend might be in danger?

114
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:43,480
Aren’t you relaxed like I told you?

115
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:45,520
Nu-Lin

116
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:48,159
Yes?

117
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,160
At first when you ask me to come here I’m a bit scared.

118
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:03,440
I thought you would…

119
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:04,320
What would I do?

120
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:07,640
What did you think I would do?

121
00:08:08,920 --> 00:08:10,880
No, it’s nothing.

122
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,400
I’m going to keep massaging you then.

123
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:54,520
I think

124
00:08:56,520 --> 00:08:57,800
we should stop.

125
00:09:01,520 --> 00:09:02,560
It’s

126
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:03,920
getting very late.

127
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:09,560
You still have to

128
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:11,480
go home and

129
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,920
you have to work tomorrow

130
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:15,880
You might not be able to wake up on time.

131
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:17,600
Here,

132
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,040
I'll dry it out for you.

133
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,360
Err.. P’Sun,

134
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:23,440
Did we

135
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,960
really rent a room this expensive

136
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,400
just for

137
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,840
massaging?

138
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,960
Is there anything else you want me to do?

139
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,560
No, not really.

140
00:09:42,400 --> 00:09:43,920
I’m just asking.

141
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:46,400
Too bad.

142
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,480
This room is really expensive.

143
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:57,240
Oh no,

144
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,080
the clouds are really big,

145
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,960
it might be raining soon.

146
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:04,040
How did you get here?

147
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:05,200
Er..

148
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,560
By motorbike,

149
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:09,680
but

150
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,120
no need to worry.

151
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,840
I can go.

152
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:17,440
I’m just thinking that if you don’t mind,

153
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,960
you can stay here with me for the night.

154
00:10:25,840 --> 00:10:26,640
It would be nice because

155
00:10:28,120 --> 00:10:28,920
it’s about to rain anyways.

156
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:31,200
it is especially,

157
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,760
if you ride a motorke

158
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,160
I think

159
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,000
it can be very dangerous.

160
00:10:39,800 --> 00:10:41,000
Earlier, you asked that

161
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,920
if I would do anything to you.

162
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,680
Honestly, I thought of that.

163
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:52,960
Thought of what?

164
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:56,400
I thought of doing that thing with you.

165
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:01,160
I am a human being,

166
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:04,040
I have feelings,

167
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:13,520
but don’t you worry.

168
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,320
I won’t do anything.

169
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,720
You can trust me.

170
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,040
I am.

171
00:11:24,520 --> 00:11:25,760
You should go and take a shower so

172
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:27,600
you’ll be comfortable.

173
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:30,000
Okay,

174
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:34,560
I’m going to take a shower now.

175
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:37,080
Okay.

176
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:27,360
I heard mom talk about your fiancé for a while.

177
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:30,640
Maybe this time  she really wants you to get engaged.

178
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:33,600
How about this?

179
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:36,160
If she wants to find you someone,

180
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:37,640
you should find someone else before she did.

181
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:39,240
Someone?

182
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:39,640
Yeah

183
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:41,440
You don’t have anyone right?

184
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:43,040
How can I find that?

185
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,600
That is not a problem.

186
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:45,800
Can I have your phone?

187
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:48,920
Hurry!

188
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:52,760
Here,

189
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:55,160
I’ll get you a dating app.

190
00:13:55,520 --> 00:13:56,320
Hia,

191
00:13:56,680 --> 00:13:57,840
can I use this picture?

192
00:13:58,200 --> 00:13:59,480
So people won’t know what you actually look like.

193
00:13:59,480 --> 00:13:59,840
Okay,

194
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:01,280
let try it out

195
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:03,880
What should I put your occupation as?

196
00:14:04,520 --> 00:14:06,080
Maybe,

197
00:14:06,080 --> 00:14:07,800
you should just be an office worker.

198
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,000
If I did this,

199
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,800
it would feel like I’m scamming someone.

200
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,240
Don’t think too much

201
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:15,320
and

202
00:14:15,800 --> 00:14:16,800
you are very busy.

203
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:18,680
How else are you going to find someone?

204
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:21,640
Look!

205
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:23,480
Swipe right.

206
00:14:24,640 --> 00:14:25,320
Wow!

207
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:26,840
That was just destiny.

208
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:48,720
Have you already woken up?

209
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:51,880
Yes, I have.

210
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:54,720
For how long?

211
00:14:58,040 --> 00:14:59,080
For a while now, but

212
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,600
I don’t want to get up and go anywhere.

213
00:15:06,520 --> 00:15:08,520
I just want to keep looking at you like this.

214
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,400
Why?

215
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,760
Last night,

216
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:25,000
other people wouldn’t have done we just did.

217
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:55,400
I just want us to be something more not just a one night stand.

218
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:06,040
You should get up to wash your face and brush your teeth

219
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,080
so you can go to work.

220
00:16:11,280 --> 00:16:12,080
No,

221
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,160
I still want to keep looking at your face.

222
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:41,120
Here,

223
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:41,480
let me help.

224
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:43,320
It’s fine

225
00:16:43,320 --> 00:16:44,440
I can do it myself.

226
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:47,120
You should save you energy to do the work.

227
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:47,400
Okay?

228
00:16:49,800 --> 00:16:50,600
Let go of the towel.

229
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,640
Er..

230
00:17:06,839 --> 00:17:08,480
I think it’s already dried.

231
00:17:10,960 --> 00:17:11,920
Let me see.

232
00:17:11,920 --> 00:17:12,960
Is it really dried?

233
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:18,000
I think it is.

234
00:17:18,359 --> 00:17:18,920
It is.

235
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:22,920
Do you want

236
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,280
me to take you to your condo?

237
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:27,880
Um..

238
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:29,840
I think

239
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,680
I’ll get a taxi myself.

240
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,840
Taxi at this time?

241
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:38,040
You’ll be stuck in the traffic.

242
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:40,840
You’re right.

243
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,320
The traffic must be terrible now.

244
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:46,440
Come with me?

245
00:17:48,680 --> 00:17:49,600
I…

246
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,800
Please

247
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:53,600
Please..

248
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,800
I think…

249
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,440
You don’t want to go with me?

250
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,440
It’s not that

251
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:01,120
I don’t want to go with you.

252
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,640
I just…

253
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:05,080
Let me take you back then

254
00:18:07,960 --> 00:18:09,360
so it’s easier for you.

255
00:18:10,760 --> 00:18:11,680
Okay?

256
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:13,560
Please Please Please

257
00:18:14,040 --> 00:18:15,000
Let me take you back.

258
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,400
Please.

259
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,840
Alright please do take me home.

260
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,360
You’re the cutest.

261
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:28,160
I told you that you

262
00:19:31,920 --> 00:19:33,000
have to be careful.

263
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:52,040
You need to cover more.

264
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:05,080
I'll be waiting for you on the first floor.

265
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:32,400
Er..

266
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,240
Is this

267
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:35,360
your motorbike?

268
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:37,800
What’s wrong with it?

269
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:39,840
You’re not okay with it?

270
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,480
You told me that you’re a normal office worker right?

271
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:44,960
But why

272
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:48,880
do you have a motorbike that costs millions bath.

273
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:51,520
Also last night I noticed that

274
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:54,640
you wore all the designer brands

275
00:20:56,920 --> 00:20:57,800
or

276
00:20:58,600 --> 00:20:59,520
maybe

277
00:20:59,520 --> 00:21:00,560
you own an illicit business or something?

278
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:02,400
What?

279
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:04,360
An illicit business?

280
00:21:04,760 --> 00:21:05,800
Scammer!

281
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,120
That is it right?

282
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:09,520
No.

283
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,800
You have an online store?

284
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,080
Erm..

285
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:13,160
No!

286
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,000
A rider?

287
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,480
No

288
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,960
Or do you do

289
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,200
stock trading?

290
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:22,400
Am I right?

291
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,120
You are completely wrong.

292
00:21:26,720 --> 00:21:27,520
Actually,

293
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:31,520
I borrowed this from my friend.

294
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:35,040
I just want you to be impressed by me.

295
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:37,880
Ahh.

296
00:21:39,720 --> 00:21:40,880
I’m sorry

297
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:43,000
for accusing you of doing something illegal.

298
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,440
Next time you don’t have to do all this

299
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,880
I'm quite an easy-going person.

300
00:21:50,360 --> 00:21:51,480
Then

301
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:53,560
next time I will ride my own motorbike.

302
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:55,240
Is the oaky?

303
00:21:56,840 --> 00:21:57,320
Yes!

304
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,960
We

305
00:21:58,960 --> 00:21:59,760
better get going

306
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,440
or you’ll be late. That’s right.

307
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:14,520
Hop on!

308
00:22:14,520 --> 00:22:14,920
Okay.

309
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:19,120
Er..

310
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,760
Where do I sit?

311
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:22,120
Here,

312
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:23,680
you sit right here.

313
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,200
Oh!

314
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,400
Right here.

315
00:22:25,400 --> 00:22:25,880
Yes!

316
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:27,360
I’m hopping on now.

317
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:30,600
Okay get on.

318
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:33,640
I’m sorry.

319
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:39,680
Erm…

320
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,440
P’Sun

321
00:22:41,880 --> 00:22:42,760
the thing

322
00:22:43,920 --> 00:22:44,800
is.

323
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,720
Can you ride slowly please

324
00:22:47,680 --> 00:22:49,720
Security is our priority!

325
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:53,240
Then

326
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:55,000
take both of your hands

327
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,280
and hug me

328
00:22:57,200 --> 00:22:58,200
right here.

329
00:22:58,200 --> 00:22:59,200
Bothe side.

330
00:23:02,960 --> 00:23:04,280
If you want to be safe

331
00:23:05,520 --> 00:23:06,480
you have to hug me tight.

332
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:08,320
Okay!

333
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:11,200
Here we go.

334
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,440
Just held hands while sleeping?

335
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,560
It isn’t true right?

336
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,400
It is true.

337
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:43,000
We didn’t do anything.

338
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:44,280
We just held hands.

339
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:46,400
Can I really trust you?

340
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,760
Or you didn’t tell me.

341
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,680
You can tell me.

342
00:23:49,680 --> 00:23:50,560
Just tell me everything.

343
00:23:51,280 --> 00:23:52,160
Pim,

344
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:53,600
isn’t that a good thing

345
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:55,160
that they just held hands.

346
00:23:55,480 --> 00:23:57,480
I’m just happy that Lin is fine.

347
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:58,720
Right?

348
00:23:59,040 --> 00:23:59,680
Yes!

349
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:00,120
Yeah?

350
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:02,680
I’m so proud of you.

351
00:24:02,680 --> 00:24:04,160
Lin,

352
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,120
I’m going crazy now.

353
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,000
Is there something else?

354
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:08,920
Right?

355
00:24:10,800 --> 00:24:11,720
There’s nothing else right?

356
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,800
I’m really proud of you.

357
00:24:13,800 --> 00:24:14,960
But they were together the whole day.

358
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:17,960
Here we go again.

359
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:20,160
Yes.

360
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,400
Everbody,

361
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,040
the president

362
00:24:24,040 --> 00:24:24,920
want to meet all of you.

363
00:24:30,360 --> 00:24:31,960
The president has called us in?

364
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,000
It might be for a good reason.

365
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,680
Come on, come come.

366
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:37,600
Follow me quickly.

367
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,680
And

368
00:24:39,960 --> 00:24:42,240
once you get to the president,

369
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:44,240
you have to behave nicely.

370
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,200
Be nice!

371
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:46,600
Here, look at this.

372
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:48,120
The nacklace

373
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,440
in the picture

374
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:50,520
I designed it myself.

375
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,920
Wow!

376
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:54,280
It’s really nothing.

377
00:25:07,160 --> 00:25:07,960
Hey!

378
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:09,800
Here they are.

379
00:25:24,520 --> 00:25:26,520
The interns

380
00:25:26,520 --> 00:25:27,200
are here.

381
00:25:28,440 --> 00:25:30,080
Good morning.

382
00:25:30,680 --> 00:25:31,480
Hurry and follow me inside.

383
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,160
The president is expecting you guys.

384
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:36,080
Let’s go.

385
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:46,840
We’re in a middle of a crisis but

386
00:25:47,160 --> 00:25:50,120
Madame Wang, are you really going to let a new grad run your company?

387
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:51,800
That’s right.

388
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:54,680
You can’t really make a decision on your own like that.

389
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:57,160
I’m as a CEO

390
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,840
has every right to make that decision.

391
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:01,720
Fine,

392
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:05,640
if you all don’t like my decision then tell me who it should be?

393
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:14,760
Okay,

394
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:17,880
if none of you don’t want to talk then that’s my final decision.

395
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,280
Although, I will give a chance to Suriyen

396
00:26:20,680 --> 00:26:22,600
but I’m not that self-centered so

397
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,560
I’m only going to give him six months.

398
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,320
To improve the company,

399
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:27,360
to make it better.

400
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,680
If he fails

401
00:26:30,200 --> 00:26:33,360
I would make him resign from the position myself.

402
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:40,160
Mr. President,

403
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:42,080
here are the interns that you want to meet.

404
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,960
Thay are all here.

405
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,440
Let them in.

406
00:26:46,280 --> 00:26:46,840
Come in.

407
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:54,520
They are here now.

408
00:27:10,200 --> 00:27:11,800
If you don’t mind

409
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,360
you can stay over for the night here.

410
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:16,440
Have you been woken up for a while?

411
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,600
I just want to keep looking at you like this.

412
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:21,000
I also want to keep looking at you like this.

413
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:22,360
Let me take you back. Let me take you back.

414
00:27:23,800 --> 00:27:26,040
You told me that you are just a normal office worker right?

415
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:33,920
Totally my type.

416
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,400
Lin!

417
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:40,520
Lin!

418
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:42,280
Lin

419
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:42,840
Yes?

420
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:43,840
What?

421
00:27:44,160 --> 00:27:44,960
What’s wrong?

422
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:46,400
No,

423
00:27:46,560 --> 00:27:47,520
nothing.

424
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:48,880
or maybe..

425
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,120
You still think about last night.

426
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:56,840
Nothing happened.

427
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,280
What are you talking about?

428
00:27:58,280 --> 00:27:59,560
I told you it’s nothing.

429
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:10,200
I already went through all of your designs.

430
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:12,880
Your designing skills are quite

431
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,520
interesting.

432
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:20,680
Really?

433
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,920
Maybe because I'm the one

434
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,320
who gave them a chance and

435
00:28:26,320 --> 00:28:29,320
I’m always by their side to help them.

436
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,640
That’s why they did such outstanding work.

437
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,200
Isn’t that right?

438
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:34,400
Do you like it? didn’t you

439
00:28:41,280 --> 00:28:43,560
Can you pass this along to Kaewmanee?

440
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:44,720
Oh!

441
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:46,400
Of course.

442
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:50,560
I also

443
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:52,000
want you to

444
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:54,320
take care of these four interns.

445
00:28:57,280 --> 00:28:59,120
Of course,

446
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,280
I will take care of them very strictly.

447
00:29:02,840 --> 00:29:04,120
As for four of you

448
00:29:05,160 --> 00:29:07,280
keep improving yourself.

449
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:10,640
I’m counting for your next designs.

450
00:29:10,840 --> 00:29:13,040
Of course, You can trust m er.

451
00:29:13,920 --> 00:29:15,240
I mean you can trust us.

452
00:29:16,200 --> 00:29:17,000
Good.

453
00:29:18,840 --> 00:29:20,240
If there’s nothing now please

454
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,120
excuse us.

455
00:29:24,960 --> 00:29:25,920
Hurry!

456
00:29:25,920 --> 00:29:26,360
Go!

457
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:28,760
Wait,

458
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,720
Can I talk with Salin privately?

459
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,120
Salin?

460
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:35,960
Just one?

461
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:39,520
Yes

462
00:29:39,520 --> 00:29:40,560
All right Salin.

463
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:42,640
Go Go

464
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:45,440
คุณสลิล

465
00:29:57,160 --> 00:29:58,320
Just only Salin.

466
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,040
You may leave.

467
00:30:00,040 --> 00:30:00,720
Oh,

468
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,120
Okay!

469
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,400
Is there anything that I can help you with?, Mr.President.

470
00:30:25,040 --> 00:30:25,880
Come on, Lin.

471
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,000
There’s only two of us now.

472
00:30:32,520 --> 00:30:33,880
Just talk with me normally.

473
00:30:38,160 --> 00:30:38,960
I know that

474
00:30:40,280 --> 00:30:42,000
no matter what I say

475
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,120
it won’t make anything better.

476
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:49,080
All I want is you to trust me

477
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:50,920
that I really have reasons.

478
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:59,080
May I get to work on my designing please.

479
00:31:00,360 --> 00:31:00,800
Lin,

480
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:01,880
listen to me please.

481
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,480
Can you give me a chance to fix this?

482
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:09,640
Or

483
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,560
If you

484
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:11,680
don’t like it

485
00:31:12,400 --> 00:31:13,800
we can try getting to know each other from the start.

486
00:31:15,320 --> 00:31:17,360
Please..

487
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:22,920
Excuse me.

488
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:55,560
Lin,

489
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:56,560
I’m sorry

490
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,280
I think the concept of this competition

491
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,480
we should have Thai culture in the design.

492
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:19,640
I think it would give the design a wow factor.

493
00:32:20,280 --> 00:32:21,880
You're right, It can be like soft power.

494
00:32:22,360 --> 00:32:22,760
Yeah!

495
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:23,400
Very interesting!

496
00:32:23,400 --> 00:32:25,160
Hello, everyone.

497
00:32:25,160 --> 00:32:27,200
You guys are working very diligently.

498
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,560
Mr.President gave me something to pass along and

499
00:32:30,920 --> 00:32:32,360
they are snacks.

500
00:32:32,800 --> 00:32:33,920
President?

501
00:32:33,920 --> 00:32:35,080
Yeah, I heard that

502
00:32:35,080 --> 00:32:37,640
he would like you guys to focus on your work.

503
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:40,160
Sugar gives you a sugar rush so you can think better.

504
00:32:40,160 --> 00:32:42,120
Here you go, Sam.

505
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:44,560
These are

506
00:32:44,560 --> 00:32:46,000
for you, Salin.

507
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,120
I will put it right here for you.

508
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:48,080
Gotta go!

509
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,600
I’m sorry.

510
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,160
Can you just respond to me in the chat?

511
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:12,920
Ouch!

512
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:13,720
Ops!

513
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:16,240
P’Saran?

514
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:16,760
Yes

515
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,000
Would you like some snacks?

516
00:33:19,000 --> 00:33:21,280
What snacks?

517
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:23,760
I can’t really see.

518
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,800
I don’t really like snacks.

519
00:33:25,800 --> 00:33:29,480
What do you like to eat then?

520
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,280
Boba tea!

521
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,160
Oh so you don’t like this.

522
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:35,160
And also this. This one as well.

523
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,920
So if you don’t like these

524
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:39,280
I’m going to eat all of these for you.

525
00:33:39,320 --> 00:33:41,960
I’m really eating these for you because I actually don’t really like them too.

526
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,200
Okay..

527
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:47,880
Lin doesn’t like doughnuts.

528
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,400
He prefers boba tea.

529
00:33:49,400 --> 00:33:50,320
What should we do?

530
00:33:51,400 --> 00:33:52,760
We can’t decide on the color yet.

531
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:54,360
It’s really hard to choose one.

532
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:57,360
Do you want to have a look at this color chart?

533
00:33:57,880 --> 00:33:59,040
Or you can check more colors over there?

534
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:01,280
In the evening, you guys are still working diligently.

535
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,840
Here you go, Mr. President bought you guys boba tea.

536
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:04,920
Presiden again?

537
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:06,160
Pick one kids.

538
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,560
That’s right.

539
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,880
Here yo go.

540
00:34:08,880 --> 00:34:11,239
This is yours, Salin.

541
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,320
Thank you.

542
00:34:13,239 --> 00:34:14,040
Gotta go.

543
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:27,000
I’m really sorry. Please just text me back.

544
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,080
Here,

545
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:38,120
this is yours.

546
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:40,520
Are you going to eat this?

547
00:34:40,520 --> 00:34:42,480
Didn’t you say that you like boba tea?

548
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:44,560
I liked it but

549
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,199
not anymore.

550
00:34:47,239 --> 00:34:48,480
But if you don’t want

551
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,199
you can share it with any of them.

552
00:34:52,440 --> 00:34:54,000
Pim, have you decided on the color yet?

553
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,320
I think it’s not snacks that Lin doesn’t like.

554
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,040
What doesn’t he like?

555
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:02,720
Maybe he doesn’t like you.

556
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:13,360
Hello sir.

557
00:35:14,520 --> 00:35:15,320
How is it, Chan?

558
00:35:15,760 --> 00:35:19,760
It’s not working.

559
00:35:19,760 --> 00:35:22,560
No matter it is snacks

560
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:24,960
or boba tea.

561
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:26,560
He would’t take it

562
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:28,520
from what I heard.

563
00:35:29,840 --> 00:35:31,040
It’s not helping at all.

564
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,120
Your agenda tomorrow consists of

565
00:35:36,120 --> 00:35:37,920
two online meetings.

566
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,000
In the afternoon you have to go check on the marketing team.

567
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:41,440
The day after that you have to go to the gem cutter site

568
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,680
and then you have a meeting to discuss about jewelry QC

569
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,520
with a partner from Head Quarter.

570
00:35:46,280 --> 00:35:47,080
Oh!

571
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:51,000
Next week you also need to attend a seminar about Jewelry in Hong Kong.

572
00:35:51,000 --> 00:35:52,200
I already booked a flight for you.

573
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:53,480
Can you go as representative of me?

574
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:53,920
What?

575
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,560
What were you saying?

576
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:57,560
How can I go?

577
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:00,560
You are my right hand.

578
00:36:01,200 --> 00:36:02,400
It’s no different.

579
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:05,080
It is different because

580
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,560
this seminar is a really good opportunity to

581
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,600
debut you to the jewelry community.

582
00:36:11,040 --> 00:36:12,600
There are so many gems over there

583
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:15,520
so it needs people who’s

584
00:36:15,720 --> 00:36:18,160
knowledgeable like you.

585
00:36:22,360 --> 00:36:24,400
I think it’s interesting

586
00:36:26,440 --> 00:36:27,920
an opportunity like this

587
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:31,560
I can’t let it go.

588
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:32,920
That’s right.

589
00:36:40,640 --> 00:36:41,440
What!?

590
00:36:42,440 --> 00:36:43,240
Are you sure about this?

591
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:49,240
At the moment, we have a lot of emerald cuts in stock.

592
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:51,880
I think I will use them in the new collection

593
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:55,000
that will be released during Christmas according to the marketing plan.

594
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:56,360
What do you guys think?

595
00:36:58,680 --> 00:36:59,440
I think it is a good idea.

596
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:09,320
Hello, everyone.

597
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:12,280
Excuse me.

598
00:37:18,520 --> 00:37:19,320
You may have a drink first.

599
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,000
Thanks.

600
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:34,320
I have something to inform you guys.

601
00:37:35,440 --> 00:37:40,160
Next week , there will be a seminar called ‘World Jewelry' in Hong Kong.

602
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,320
Two people from this department are able to join.

603
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,840
Any volunteer?

604
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,640
Me!

605
00:37:50,840 --> 00:37:53,120
A spot belongs to Juladis.

606
00:37:53,120 --> 00:37:53,680
That’s right.

607
00:37:54,080 --> 00:37:55,080
Me too.

608
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:56,000
Oh Mrs. Rungnapa,

609
00:37:56,840 --> 00:38:00,520
you still haven’t finished your work that is due next week.

610
00:38:01,160 --> 00:38:02,440
That’s such a shame.

611
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,720
I’m so sorry.

612
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:05,480
Prim as well.

613
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
Don't forget to give me your first draft next week.

614
00:38:09,960 --> 00:38:11,480
Can I go?

615
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:13,000
Kaewmanee,

616
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:16,480
you still own me

617
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,560
two project.

618
00:38:18,120 --> 00:38:19,280
What a shame!

619
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:25,360
Or could it be any intern

620
00:38:25,800 --> 00:38:27,120
around here.

621
00:38:27,480 --> 00:38:29,120
You can go with your mentor.

622
00:38:29,120 --> 00:38:31,720
Juladis!

623
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:33,640
I I I don’t want to go.

624
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:36,480
Why don’t Pim and Lin just do rock paper scissors?

625
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,760
I mean because I’m afraid of airplanes.

626
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:42,400
I’m not going as well.

627
00:38:42,840 --> 00:38:44,760
I’m afraid of airplanes too.

628
00:38:48,960 --> 00:38:50,120
I wouldn't want to go as well.

629
00:38:50,240 --> 00:38:52,680
I think I’ill let Pim go.

630
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,200
Pim likes to travel.

631
00:38:54,920 --> 00:38:55,680
Isn’t that right?

632
00:38:56,520 --> 00:38:57,080
Lin..

633
00:38:57,080 --> 00:38:58,000
You can go shopping.

634
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,320
Oh! I forgot to mention that due to the limited budget we are able to book only a room.

635
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:03,240
No!

636
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:05,400
I don’t think it would be appropriate.

637
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:07,360
I’m not going as well because

638
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:12,320
I also have a thing as well, a date with my boyfriend.

639
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:15,000
Boyfriend comes first.

640
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:20,640
Lin, you told me that you want to go.

641
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:20,920
Er..

642
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:25,720
Alright!

643
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:28,160
That’s settled.

644
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,880
Salin will be the representative from Soul High jewelry to attend

645
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:33,800
a seminar alongside with Juladis.

646
00:39:34,600 --> 00:39:35,680
Bravo!

647
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:36,600
Congrats!

648
00:39:44,440 --> 00:39:45,240
เฮ้อ

649
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:46,720
I feel bad for Lin that

650
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,920
he has to go to Hong Kong with P’Juladis.

651
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:50,920
Agree.

652
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:52,440
Do you want to go then?

653
00:39:53,280 --> 00:39:54,800
I think that Lin doesn’t really want to go.

654
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,200
No,

655
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:58,720
I rather work here.

656
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:02,720
Lin,

657
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,080
water just for you.

658
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:06,320
Thank you.

659
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,840
You lunch too.

660
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,080
Pim, this is yours.

661
00:40:09,160 --> 00:40:10,240
Thanks.

662
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:13,720
Wow!

663
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:19,040
Lin,

664
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:22,520
you have to go on a trip with P’Juladis,

665
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:25,800
won’t that make the  person that you’re talking to get jealous.

666
00:40:27,560 --> 00:40:29,840
It’s nice that I get to go to Hong Kong

667
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:34,040
so that I don’t have to see a liar.

668
00:40:34,080 --> 00:40:34,480
What!?

669
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:37,000
Who’s lying?

670
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:39,720
A liar?

671
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:45,840
No!

672
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:47,200
No one.

673
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:14,440
What are you looking for?

674
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:16,880
Er..

675
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:18,840
I’m looking for my bo..

676
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:20,720
Er.. I mean

677
00:41:21,440 --> 00:41:22,280
the secretary of our president.

678
00:41:24,040 --> 00:41:26,800
I heard that he’s going to bring us some documents for the seminar.

679
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,360
It’s getting very late and he’s not here yet.

680
00:41:32,680 --> 00:41:34,840
How can people be so irresponsible?

681
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:37,720
No puntual at all.

682
00:41:38,040 --> 00:41:43,440
So late. Never get to the meeting on time.

683
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:46,520
He should be punished.

684
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,200
Don’t you think so?

685
00:41:50,680 --> 00:41:51,520
That’s a good Idea right?

686
00:41:52,840 --> 00:41:55,000
I think I should call him. It is too late now.

687
00:41:55,320 --> 00:41:56,840
We don’t want to miss the flight.

688
00:41:59,280 --> 00:41:59,840
อื้ม

689
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,240
Hello,

690
00:42:03,160 --> 00:42:06,240
where are you now?

691
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:08,560
Me and an intern from my team already got here.

692
00:42:09,480 --> 00:42:11,400
We’ve been waiting for quite a while now.

693
00:42:12,240 --> 00:42:12,880
What!?

694
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,640
I want to only see you, my love.

695
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:17,200
Can’t you just let your intern go inside first?

696
00:42:17,760 --> 00:42:19,600
Please wait for me.

697
00:42:19,600 --> 00:42:22,160
Alright fine I’ll wait.

698
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:27,920
Er..

699
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:32,560
Salin, you should go and do the check-in first.

700
00:42:32,760 --> 00:42:34,880
I have to wait for the documents from Mr. Chan

701
00:42:34,880 --> 00:42:37,040
and we have to pass that document sling to Madame Wang.

702
00:42:37,520 --> 00:42:39,920
Actually, I can wait here with you.

703
00:42:42,040 --> 00:42:43,800
No no no, no need to.

704
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:46,960
This is between me and him because

705
00:42:47,520 --> 00:42:50,400
it is a really important document.

706
00:42:51,440 --> 00:42:53,200
You go and check-in first.

707
00:42:53,680 --> 00:42:54,800
Okay?

708
00:42:55,040 --> 00:42:55,400
Okay.

709
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:58,200
See you inside.

710
00:42:58,200 --> 00:42:58,800
Okay.

711
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:05,080
Please go.

712
00:43:07,160 --> 00:43:07,800
Hello

713
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:13,680
How long does it take for him to get here?

714
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,040
I’ll hug him hard.

715
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:22,240
Ouch!

716
00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,000
Sorry, I’m really sorry.

717
00:43:24,520 --> 00:43:26,360
I’m in a hurry to check-in.

718
00:43:26,360 --> 00:43:27,040
Ugh!

719
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:30,360
Is it broken?

720
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,560
โห่

721
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:34,200
These are really expensive.

722
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:35,440
Again I’m sorry.

723
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:39,600
Watch out when you walk.

724
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:41,960
How can you not see me?

725
00:43:47,440 --> 00:43:48,120
My love!

726
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:49,680
Yes, my love.

727
00:43:50,040 --> 00:43:50,920
You don’t have to wait for me.

728
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:51,320
What!?

729
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:53,640
I don’t have to.

730
00:43:53,640 --> 00:43:55,160
President just called me to say that he has an urgent meeting.

731
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:58,440
I was expecting to hug you.

732
00:43:58,440 --> 00:43:59,920
Later okay?

733
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,200
That’s too bad.

734
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,840
The intern already got inside.

735
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,640
Aren’t you really coming?

736
00:44:06,080 --> 00:44:07,800
The path is clear now.

737
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:10,000
Why don’t you hurry and come?

738
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,040
Why are you getting mad at me?

739
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:12,680
อุ้ย

740
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:16,000
I’m not.

741
00:44:17,240 --> 00:44:19,160
I’ll call you once I get there.

742
00:44:19,480 --> 00:44:20,440
Alright.

743
00:44:20,440 --> 00:44:21,360
Okay?

744
00:44:21,400 --> 00:44:22,520
Yes!

745
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,400
Miss you.

746
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,480
Miss you too.

747
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:25,360
Bye Bye.

748
00:44:25,360 --> 00:44:26,120
Good bye.

749
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:29,560
Hello sir.

750
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:30,280
Hello.

751
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:31,560
May I please?

752
00:44:32,960 --> 00:44:34,000
Er..

753
00:44:34,400 --> 00:44:35,480
I’m sorry.

754
00:44:35,480 --> 00:44:36,000
Yeah.

755
00:44:36,000 --> 00:44:39,720
You don’t look like your passport picture.

756
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:44,880
It’s normal. Am I getting more handsome right?

757
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,240
Might be that.

758
00:44:46,480 --> 00:44:47,120
Yeah.

759
00:44:47,240 --> 00:44:47,520
Okay.

760
00:44:48,760 --> 00:44:49,520
What is this?

761
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:50,960
Can you have a look at the picture please?

762
00:44:54,680 --> 00:44:55,200
Wait!

763
00:44:57,320 --> 00:44:58,120
Who is this person?

764
00:44:58,320 --> 00:45:00,440
Is that not you?

765
00:45:00,640 --> 00:45:01,600
Did you give me the wrong one?

766
00:45:02,240 --> 00:45:03,080
or you swabbed it with someone else.

767
00:45:03,080 --> 00:45:04,400
I don’t think so.

768
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Can you check it out first?

769
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:08,480
Ah,

770
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:10,480
can you wait here just a moment?

771
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:11,000
Yes. Yes.

772
00:45:11,000 --> 00:45:11,720
I’ll be right back.

773
00:45:11,720 --> 00:45:12,120
Please.

774
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:12,760
I can still make it on time right?

775
00:45:12,760 --> 00:45:13,240
You can.

776
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:13,520
Okay.

777
00:45:14,600 --> 00:45:15,280
It must be that guy.

778
00:45:51,640 --> 00:45:53,040
Where is P’Juladis.

779
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:54,920
The plane is about to takeoff.

780
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:03,720
May I sit with you?

781
00:46:10,880 --> 00:46:11,680
P’Sun

782
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:14,480
Yes, it’s me.

783
00:46:15,320 --> 00:46:16,640
Where is P’Juladis?

784
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:18,720
Ah,

785
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:21,200
he has urgent work to do.

786
00:46:21,560 --> 00:46:22,880
So I came here instead.

787
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:39,640
Where can I keep this?

788
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:42,080
No where.

789
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:43,920
I have to hold this.

790
00:46:45,560 --> 00:46:46,520
I can put it here right?

791
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,360
All of these are parts of your plan right?

792
00:47:02,920 --> 00:47:03,720
No.

793
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:05,720
What plan? There’s no plan.

794
00:47:06,640 --> 00:47:07,600
You look very suspicious.

795
00:47:13,760 --> 00:47:14,560
Er..

796
00:47:15,840 --> 00:47:16,840
This flight

797
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:19,880
I can sit with you right?

798
00:47:20,800 --> 00:47:21,920
Can you sit here?

799
00:47:21,920 --> 00:47:23,520
This is economy.

800
00:47:24,200 --> 00:47:25,120
Totally, fine.

801
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:25,760
อืม

802
00:47:30,920 --> 00:47:31,800
It’s quite small.

803
00:47:40,200 --> 00:47:41,000
That’s okay.

804
00:48:05,200 --> 00:48:06,000
I’m sorry.

805
00:48:11,200 --> 00:48:13,600
ํYou shouldn’t do this if it is so inconvenient for you.

806
00:48:15,000 --> 00:48:16,000
It’s not inconvenient.

807
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,480
In fact, I’m very comfortable.

808
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:38,240
Are you scared?

809
00:48:39,720 --> 00:48:41,800
No, I’m fine.

810
00:50:23,280 --> 00:50:26,080
This Hong Kong trip is my apology to you.

811
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:28,080
Can we start over together?

812
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:29,440
Nu-Lin

813
00:50:30,000 --> 00:50:33,360
We have to keep our relationship a secret.

814
00:50:33,600 --> 00:50:34,680
How was your Hong Kong trip?

815
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:36,040
That’s right.

816
00:50:36,040 --> 00:50:36,840
Who did you go with?

817
00:50:37,480 --> 00:50:38,800
I want to be a little more open.

818
00:50:38,960 --> 00:50:40,680
So that I can be your friend right?

819
00:50:42,160 --> 00:50:43,680
Can we kiss?
