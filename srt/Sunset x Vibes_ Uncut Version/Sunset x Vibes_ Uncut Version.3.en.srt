1
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,440
The interns that you want to meet

2
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:07,200
are here now.

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:13,720
May I talk with Salin in private please.

4
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:15,480
Lin, can you give me a chance?

5
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:17,400
We can get to know each other from the start.

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:18,720
Next week,

7
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,000
There will be the world jewelry seminar

8
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:22,160
in Hong Kong.

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:24,160
You can go inside

10
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:25,760
and check-in first.

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,360
Okay

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,040
May I sit here?

13
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,800
P’Sun

14
00:00:35,080 --> 00:00:35,880
Lin!

15
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:36,680
What?

16
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:38,040
So what really happened?

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:39,640
And why didn't P'Juladis go there?

18
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,840
Who are you with?

19
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:41,360
That’s right who?

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:42,680
I’ll tell you everything once I’m back.

21
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:44,360
What!?

22
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:45,280
Oh my god!!

23
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:47,400
Who’s that?

24
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,480
Are you okay?

25
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,080
I’m fine.

26
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:05,960
I’m not scared.

27
00:03:39,520 --> 00:03:40,440
What nice weather!

28
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,280
Don’t you think so?

29
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:47,760
Are you alright?

30
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:51,720
You didn’t tell me

31
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:53,720
the reason that you’re here.

32
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:01,040
Well, this is the price I’m willing to pay

33
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,800
to make it up to you right?

34
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:11,800
Let just say

35
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,320
that this Hong Kong trip

36
00:04:13,880 --> 00:04:15,320
is my apology to you.

37
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:24,600
So we could start things over please?

38
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:26,440
Nu-Lin?

39
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:29,480
Please?

40
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:31,040
Please?

41
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,360
Please, Please, Please.

42
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,120
Can we please?

43
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:38,200
Hey,

44
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:40,600
wait for me?

45
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:51,880
Lin,

46
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:56,080
come with me.

47
00:04:56,640 --> 00:04:57,080
Okay

48
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:53,840
Thank you!

49
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:01,960
Thank you for that.

50
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,800
It would be so embarrassing without you.

51
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,480
That’s alright.

52
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:10,520
I also only know the basics.

53
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:11,520
But

54
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:13,360
I didn’t know that

55
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
you can speak french.

56
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:19,000
I learned in when I was in high school

57
00:06:19,240 --> 00:06:21,320
that’s why I can speak a little bit.

58
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:05,880
P’Sun,

59
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:07,600
should we go back now?

60
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,760
Who told you that?

61
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:11,680
I mean…

62
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,120
I think

63
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,400
our plan was just to attend this seminar?

64
00:07:16,840 --> 00:07:17,640
You thought

65
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:20,480
that I would spoil our first trip together

66
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:22,600
that I’ve been planning for a while

67
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,840
to end this easily.

68
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:33,720
Come on.

69
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:35,080
Let’s go,

70
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:36,840
there are so many things waiting for you.

71
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,840
Hold on, P’Sun.

72
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:45,080
Surprise!

73
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:50,600
This is a very famous restaurant.

74
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,120
This is like a number 1 chief table in Hong Kong.

75
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:54,680
It’s really hard to get a table.

76
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:55,960
It took me quite a while.

77
00:07:58,920 --> 00:08:00,040
After this

78
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:02,360
I will take you shopping

79
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:03,480
and

80
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:04,800
go on a yacht together.

81
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,240
I think you will enjoy it a lot

82
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,080
You don’t like that?

83
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,920
I tried really hard to find a restaurant that I think you would like.

84
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:27,400
I really don’t know

85
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,480
how to make you stop being upset at me.

86
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:35,799
P’Sun,

87
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,440
I have a secret to tell you.

88
00:08:40,039 --> 00:08:40,760
What is it?

89
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:44,560
If you want to make it up to me

90
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:47,960
you don’t have to do all of these.

91
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,320
You..

92
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,240
could’ve just

93
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:55,000
take me on a walk

94
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:58,920
I think I’ll be fine as well.

95
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:07,320
So

96
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:10,840
can we go on a walk together tomorrow?

97
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:14,880
Okay!

98
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:22,560
We’ll just eat these now okay?

99
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:24,240
You don’t look really excited.

100
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,600
Can you just pretend a little?

101
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,600
Wow! It looks so appetizing.

102
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,320
Is that alright?

103
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:34,760
I’m happy now.

104
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:37,400
Let’s eat.

105
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,640
Hey, Mr. Sun.

106
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:41,560
Hey!

107
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,760
Chris?

108
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,400
What are you doing

109
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,520
I came to attend the same event that you just did.

110
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,440
I actually saw you there

111
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,920
but I hadn’t got a chance

112
00:09:53,280 --> 00:09:54,560
to say hi.

113
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,400
And who….

114
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,120
Hello

115
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,080
My name is Lin.

116
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,480
Er..

117
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:08,920
I’m..

118
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,200
I’m an intern at the designing department at Soul High jewelry.

119
00:10:18,840 --> 00:10:21,400
That’s right, he's an intern.

120
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,120
My name is Chris.

121
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,440
I'm a business partner of Soul High jewelry.

122
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,200
Nice to meet you.

123
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,240
Nice to meet you too.

124
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,600
You must really

125
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:51,760
adore the intern

126
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:54,800
because you take him to such a fancy restaurant.

127
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,600
That’s right. I really adore him.

128
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,520
Now that the seminar has ended.

129
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,640
Are you going back to Thailand immediately?

130
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:03,240
Erm..

131
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,880
I think I will spend a couple more days just traveling around.

132
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:06,840
Really?

133
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,880
Me too.

134
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:11,800
Do you two have any plans for tomorrow?

135
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:15,240
We’re talking that we might just be strolling around.

136
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:17,360
Ahh

137
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,960
I got no ones here.

138
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,640
if you don’t mind

139
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:27,440
can I hang with you two?

140
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:20,480
P’Sun

141
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:22,280
You’re sweating a lot.

142
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,680
Here, let me help you.

143
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:26,360
Thanks.

144
00:12:26,360 --> 00:12:28,360
I’m literally dripping now.

145
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:38,480
Lin, you are such a fast runner.

146
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:42,480
Good thing that I was a runner when I studied.

147
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:43,840
What!?

148
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:45,800
Where are they? Wait for me.

149
00:13:05,520 --> 00:13:06,800
How’s that?

150
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:08,440
Feeling better after praying.

151
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:10,440
So much better.

152
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,960
I haven’t been there in such a long time.

153
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:14,720
So

154
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
I felt a lot better after I prayed.

155
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:19,480
P’Sun

156
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:22,360
What were you wishing for?

157
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:23,760
Curious?

158
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:26,640
I wish that

159
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,840
we could be together

160
00:13:31,160 --> 00:13:32,640
for a long time.

161
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:38,680
Who could be together?

162
00:13:39,840 --> 00:13:41,200
No, it’s nothing.

163
00:13:41,200 --> 00:13:43,280
I mean your company and Soul high could remain as a business partner.

164
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,600
Because you are really important to us.

165
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,400
You’re too kind.

166
00:13:49,880 --> 00:13:52,960
By the way, are you two hungry?

167
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,760
Not really, we just ate.

168
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:57,280
Are you hungry?

169
00:13:57,280 --> 00:14:01,600
Perfect because somebody told me that the restaurant over there is really good.

170
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:02,720
Really?

171
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,040
Yes!

172
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:04,960
I was looking for a good restaurant.

173
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:05,960
But

174
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:08,840
aren’t you two really not coming with me?

175
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:12,240
I don’t think I can eat anymore. I ate so much today.

176
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,600
And Lin must have heat exhaustion by now.

177
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:15,920
Got it.

178
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,440
We’ll make another appointment later.

179
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,640
Do you want me to walk you there?

180
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,360
That’ll be good.

181
00:14:21,960 --> 00:14:22,560
May I?

182
00:14:22,760 --> 00:14:23,680
See you soon.

183
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:28,440
I’m gonna be honest.

184
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,520
Actually,

185
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:35,280
I already knew from the start

186
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:38,400
about the relationship between you two.

187
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,360
Huh..

188
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,440
I’m just gonna say

189
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:44,960
you have to try hard.

190
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:47,040
Hurry and score more

191
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,360
because Lin is very cute

192
00:14:56,560 --> 00:14:58,080
if you don’t hurry

193
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:00,480
someone else might just steal him from you.

194
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:02,880
Lin?

195
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:06,480
Yes

196
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:10,600
I’m sorry.

197
00:16:12,960 --> 00:16:13,840
What are you sorry about?

198
00:16:15,880 --> 00:16:16,840
About the fact

199
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:20,760
that I didn’t tell you that I’m the president of a company.

200
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:26,760
I just don’t want to be used.

201
00:16:27,760 --> 00:16:28,680
To be used?

202
00:16:30,480 --> 00:16:31,280
Yes

203
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,120
I’m just worried.

204
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,240
Think about it,

205
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,200
If it were someone else

206
00:16:39,280 --> 00:16:41,240
and I revealed all of my information.

207
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,120
What do you think

208
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:45,200
other people might approach me for?

209
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:51,360
For money?

210
00:16:54,120 --> 00:16:54,920
Yes

211
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:56,680
There are many times

212
00:16:57,600 --> 00:16:58,960
where I think I found someone

213
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,440
but eventually

214
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,200
they just want of what I have.

215
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:07,599
That’s all.

216
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:12,640
P’Sun

217
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:16,040
Erm..

218
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:21,880
Actually, I’m not mad at you or anything.

219
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,119
What?

220
00:17:23,960 --> 00:17:25,319
I just

221
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,920
want to get you back.

222
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,040
Since when?

223
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:34,280
Since from the start.

224
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,040
You’ll be punished then.

225
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:47,280
P’Sun

226
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,880
I think you should go and shower first.

227
00:17:51,640 --> 00:17:54,280
We have an early flight tomorrow.

228
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,600
Can I just hug you first?

229
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,680
Please…..

230
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,720
Can I please??

231
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:13,320
P’Sun

232
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,240
I think

233
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,360
you should go and take a shower first.

234
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:19,000
After you’re done showering

235
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:20,840
you can hug me.

236
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,640
Deal!

237
00:18:23,480 --> 00:18:25,000
Once I’m done showering

238
00:18:25,840 --> 00:18:27,240
I’ll hurry and come to hug you.

239
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,400
Alright

240
00:18:43,920 --> 00:18:44,800
Hello

241
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:45,960
Hello, Lin.

242
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:47,880
Lin!

243
00:18:47,880 --> 00:18:48,520
What is it?

244
00:18:48,520 --> 00:18:49,800
So what really happened?

245
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,640
And why didn't P'Juladis go there?

246
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:52,960
Also who are you with?

247
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:53,680
That’s right who?

248
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,960
I’ll tell you everything once I’m back in Thailand.

249
00:18:55,960 --> 00:18:57,640
It’s a long story.

250
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:58,280
What!

251
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,600
Is the hotel okay?

252
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:02,160
Stop worrying.

253
00:19:02,920 --> 00:19:03,720
I’m fine.

254
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:07,720
Who are you with?

255
00:19:07,920 --> 00:19:08,960
No, I’m all alone.

256
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:11,400
Lin..

257
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:14,200
there’s nothing to be excited about.

258
00:19:14,360 --> 00:19:16,320
It’s not the time to gossip.

259
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:20,400
Hey Hey Hey/Oh my god!

260
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:21,320
Wait!!

261
00:19:21,560 --> 00:19:22,560
Who’s in your room?

262
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:23,960
Who!?

263
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:26,400
No one.

264
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:27,160
Where?

265
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:29,000
Yeah Yeah, no one there.

266
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:30,200
I’m really here alone.

267
00:19:30,840 --> 00:19:31,840
There’s no one.

268
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,880
I saw that! Did you?

269
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:36,000
I did. Handsome?

270
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,520
Why don’t you rotate your camera around?

271
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,720
I don’t believe you. Rotate your camera around!

272
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,760
Nothing!

273
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:41,680
Really no one here.

274
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:43,640
I just saw that for real.

275
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:45,640
I saw too.

276
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,600
Whoever you’re with needs to be handsome, okay?

277
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:55,560
What are you two doing?

278
00:19:56,000 --> 00:19:58,360
We’re working

279
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,160
at our department like always.

280
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:01,640
It is so boring.

281
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:02,760
Really?

282
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:05,600
Can you get back soon? I don’t want to be left alone with Yo.

283
00:20:05,600 --> 00:20:08,600
I’ll get back there to help you as soon as I can.

284
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:13,600
Erm..

285
00:20:19,840 --> 00:20:20,880
I’m quite sleepy.

286
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,840
I’m going to sleep now.

287
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:24,600
Wait!/Wait!

288
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:25,480
Lin!

289
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:26,120
See you soon!

290
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:27,560
Bye!

291
00:20:29,560 --> 00:20:30,600
P’Sun,

292
00:20:31,480 --> 00:20:32,480
why did you do that?

293
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:39,720
I just came to hug you

294
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:41,280
because you told me that

295
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:42,720
after I showered

296
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:43,680
you’ll let me hug you.

297
00:20:46,040 --> 00:20:46,880
Here

298
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,560
My friends will find out about us because of you.

299
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:52,360
And

300
00:20:53,040 --> 00:20:54,640
did you really lie to your friends?

301
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,120
No

302
00:20:57,680 --> 00:20:58,720
I didn’t lie.

303
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,240
I just

304
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,720
don’t want them to know now.

305
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,120
When the time is right I’ll let them know.

306
00:21:08,600 --> 00:21:11,320
If I tell them not, they’ll be mad at me for sure.

307
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:15,480
P’Sun

308
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:18,520
I think you should cover up more.

309
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:19,840
It’s fine.

310
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:21,120
It’s hot in here.

311
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:24,160
I’m still wet.

312
00:21:26,760 --> 00:21:27,520
Then

313
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:36,760
I think I should get to shower first.

314
00:21:45,920 --> 00:21:46,720
P’Sun….

315
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,040
what are you doin?

316
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,120
Can I…

317
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,000
Can you what?

318
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:07,920
Can…

319
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:17,320
Oh Yo’s calling.

320
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,160
You can take his call first.

321
00:22:32,560 --> 00:22:33,560
That’s fine. I’ll talk to him later.

322
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:36,080
Where were we?

323
00:22:39,920 --> 00:22:41,040
I want to…

324
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:43,120
What do you want to ask me for?

325
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:45,400
Can I kiss you?

326
00:22:46,040 --> 00:22:46,960
I’m sorry?

327
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:48,920
Kiss you?

328
00:22:49,720 --> 00:22:50,440
Pardon me?

329
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:51,840
I can’t really hear you.

330
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:55,720
Can I kiss you?

331
00:22:55,720 --> 00:22:56,520
What!?

332
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:58,000
You’re asking for a kiss?

333
00:22:59,160 --> 00:22:59,960
Yes

334
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:02,920
Err

335
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:06,720
I…

336
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,160
It’s totally fine

337
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:08,880
if you’re not ready.

338
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:09,560
Okay

339
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:13,640
But..

340
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,200
you have to close your eyes.

341
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:17,280
Hmm?

342
00:23:17,920 --> 00:23:20,520
I have never kissed anyone before.

343
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,040
I’m afraid that I might make a funny face.

344
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,400
Alright.

345
00:23:46,320 --> 00:23:47,280
P’Sun

346
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:48,880
I think

347
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:50,880
I’ll also be closing my eyes

348
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,560
so it’ll be fair.

349
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:53,920
I’m okay with that.

350
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:01,240
Don’t open your eyes.

351
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:01,880
I won’t.

352
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:11,040
P..P’Sun!

353
00:24:11,400 --> 00:24:12,200
Ouch!

354
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:28,560
Let me see.

355
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:30,720
Did you get hurt anywhere?

356
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:32,880
I’m alright.

357
00:24:33,640 --> 00:24:34,440
You’re sure?

358
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:35,960
Good boy.

359
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:47,920
Wow!

360
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:49,080
This!

361
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:50,920
You made all of this?

362
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:51,800
Yeah

363
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:53,360
Mon!

364
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:55,440
Can you add more right here?

365
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,560
It looks a bit empty.

366
00:24:56,800 --> 00:24:58,320
I know. I got this.

367
00:24:58,640 --> 00:24:59,800
You keep telling me what to do!

368
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:01,520
Come on, help me.

369
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:03,280
I can’t really lose this.

370
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,760
Who are you going to compete with?

371
00:25:06,160 --> 00:25:07,600
Someone

372
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,040
who thinks that they are the best.

373
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,720
I came up with this

374
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:14,200
when you went home.

375
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,520
Oh my god!

376
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:16,800
That’s stunning!

377
00:25:16,920 --> 00:25:18,360
I want it.

378
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:23,520
Let me have a look.

379
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,200
If you’re as good as you said.

380
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:26,360
Usually

381
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:29,000
you are very useless.

382
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,080
Move!

383
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:35,000
You did this yourself?

384
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,600
Of course!

385
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,440
I’m sorry but

386
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:40,960
when I’m out here I couldn’t really think of anything.

387
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:42,960
So I went home and did this myself.

388
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:46,000
Yo

389
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:47,440
you keep talking about his design.

390
00:25:48,080 --> 00:25:49,720
How about yours? Are you finished?

391
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:51,280
Not yet.

392
00:25:52,920 --> 00:25:53,800
I..

393
00:25:53,800 --> 00:25:55,160
I’m a bit sick

394
00:25:55,960 --> 00:25:57,320
so I couldn’t finish it.

395
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,680
Really? you seem fine.

396
00:26:06,160 --> 00:26:07,120
I just got better now.

397
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,200
You got a problem with me?

398
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:10,720
Pim

399
00:26:11,320 --> 00:26:12,160
I need to go to the toilet.

400
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,840
O.K.

401
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,200
Pim

402
00:26:16,200 --> 00:26:17,960
he’s just bragging too much

403
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:19,120
and his work is not that great.

404
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:22,880
But normally

405
00:26:23,480 --> 00:26:25,680
Yo isn’t someone that can’t get work done on time.

406
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:28,080
It might be because of his mom.

407
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,040
His mom?

408
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,400
Nu-Lin/P’Sun

409
00:26:52,720 --> 00:26:54,000
You go first.

410
00:26:55,920 --> 00:26:57,040
I just want to ask you that

411
00:26:58,320 --> 00:26:59,760
have you ever watched a magician show?

412
00:27:00,560 --> 00:27:01,360
Hmm?

413
00:27:02,200 --> 00:27:03,160
A magichian show?

414
00:27:06,520 --> 00:27:09,800
I’m going to make this napkin disappear.

415
00:27:10,800 --> 00:27:11,600
Watch this!

416
00:27:17,160 --> 00:27:19,840
And I’ll bring this back.

417
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:21,960
look closely.

418
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,280
1 2 3

419
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,840
Tada!

420
00:27:27,280 --> 00:27:28,720
Wow!

421
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,240
Aren’t these pretty?

422
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:33,440
I think

423
00:27:34,040 --> 00:27:35,880
it would be cute

424
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:37,760
if we wear these together.

425
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,040
Here

426
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:41,680
See this?

427
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:44,120
Once these two rings are put together this way

428
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,840
you will see the sun and a full moon.

429
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,360
You’re right!

430
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,240
I got it custom made just for you.

431
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,440
You are a moon

432
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:56,800
and I’m the sun.

433
00:28:00,360 --> 00:28:01,120
I want you to have this.

434
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:03,920
Thanks a lot.

435
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,320
You like it?

436
00:28:08,680 --> 00:28:09,480
I really like it.

437
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,000
P’Sun

438
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,480
what is it? Between us?

439
00:28:29,960 --> 00:28:30,520
So..

440
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:32,480
What do you want to be?

441
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:07,640
What do you want for your beverage?

442
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,680
No,

443
00:29:12,680 --> 00:29:13,760
thanks.

444
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,840
About what you just asked.

445
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:27,480
Erm..

446
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:29,360
I think

447
00:29:31,080 --> 00:29:33,080
we can just talk for now.

448
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,120
Actually

449
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,520
I think we could be dating and also talking at the same time.

450
00:29:41,600 --> 00:29:42,400
I don’t mind that.

451
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:43,760
Or

452
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:46,000
do you care about the generation gap?

453
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,000
I’m only like eight or nine years older than you.

454
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:50,720
Hmm?

455
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,400
If you don’t believe me just feel my face.

456
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:53,760
Still soft right?

457
00:29:54,640 --> 00:29:55,520
Not soft?

458
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:57,640
No

459
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,120
It’s not that.

460
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,760
I just think that it’s too fast.

461
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:06,960
We can just get to know each other slowly.

462
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,800
In the end

463
00:30:11,920 --> 00:30:14,640
I might not be someone who you expect me to be.

464
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:20,600
Fine.

465
00:30:21,760 --> 00:30:22,880
We don’t have to be a thing now.

466
00:30:25,440 --> 00:30:25,960
But

467
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,640
we have to take our talking stage seriously.

468
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:32,200
Okay?

469
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:33,600
Okay.

470
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,400
A serious talking stage person.

471
00:30:39,320 --> 00:30:41,480
There’s another thing.

472
00:30:42,960 --> 00:30:45,920
I think about our relationship

473
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,680
we should keep it a secret.

474
00:30:50,280 --> 00:30:52,760
Since I’m just your intern

475
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:55,600
and you’re the president of the company

476
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,160
also you just took in the position as well.

477
00:30:59,160 --> 00:31:00,880
If someone finds out

478
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,400
you’ll be in big trouble.

479
00:31:08,440 --> 00:31:09,400
Wait a little bit longer. Can you?

480
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:11,160
Of course, I can.

481
00:31:15,560 --> 00:31:16,360
You’re too adorable.

482
00:31:30,120 --> 00:31:31,640
Thanks for caring about me.

483
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:33,920
No problem.

484
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:27,280
Pim

485
00:32:27,840 --> 00:32:29,120
I’m still curious

486
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:30,840
about who was in that room with Lin.

487
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:31,680
Huh.

488
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:34,280
Sometime you have to learn

489
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,880
to let it go.

490
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:38,800
If Lin wants us to know

491
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,560
he will tell us himself.

492
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,080
I’m just curious.

493
00:32:42,440 --> 00:32:43,320
He won’t tell us anything.

494
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:45,680
You’re spiraling!

495
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,360
President, hello/Hello

496
00:32:58,680 --> 00:32:59,520
You two may seat.

497
00:33:01,080 --> 00:33:01,720
Thanks.

498
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,960
I’ll sit here.

499
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:03,920
Me too.

500
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:07,880
What is he doing here?

501
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,280
How can I know that?

502
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,040
I heard you were talking about Hong Kong.

503
00:33:16,800 --> 00:33:17,800
You can ask me.

504
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,840
I was wonder if you if you knew that

505
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,720
who went to Hong Kong with Lin.

506
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:30,080
He didn’t tell you?

507
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,120
He did but

508
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:33,840
we’re just curious

509
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:35,920
so we’re asking you now.

510
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:37,040
Just like he said.

511
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:40,680
Of course, our company must have someone to supervise him.

512
00:33:41,360 --> 00:33:42,160
What!?

513
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,200
Does this mean

514
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,960
he didn’t go there alone?

515
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,160
Er..

516
00:33:51,000 --> 00:33:52,560
Did he tell you that he went there alone?

517
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:55,120
He did say that.

518
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,480
How is it really?

519
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,240
Pim, Yo

520
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,040
sorry for being la…

521
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:17,800
Hello.

522
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:23,400
May I sit here.

523
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,239
What a breath of fresh air!

524
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,199
Breath in deeply

525
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,760
on a refreshing morning!

526
00:34:35,719 --> 00:34:36,960
P’Jul

527
00:34:42,440 --> 00:34:43,320
Oh!

528
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:45,040
President,

529
00:34:46,120 --> 00:34:47,040
Hello.

530
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:06,160
May I help you with anything?

531
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:10,360
Since I just took the president position

532
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,320
I’m here just to look over everything.

533
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:14,840
All of you don’t need to worry about me being here.

534
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:18,440
Just pretend like I’m not here.

535
00:35:20,080 --> 00:35:21,040
Make yourself comfortable.

536
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:33,960
Just feel free to do anything.

537
00:35:41,840 --> 00:35:43,680
You too, President.

538
00:36:20,200 --> 00:36:21,000
What?

539
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,440
What really happened in Hong Kong?

540
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:23,920
That’s right.

541
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,240
Who were you with?

542
00:36:27,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Who could I be with?

543
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:30,440
I went there alone.

544
00:36:30,440 --> 00:36:31,160
Hmm?

545
00:36:31,800 --> 00:36:34,560
But the president said that you have someone to supervise you?

546
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:35,160
Yeah!

547
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:37,480
So..

548
00:36:38,280 --> 00:36:39,080
What is it really?

549
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,000
Erm..

550
00:36:41,000 --> 00:36:41,960
Hmm?

551
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:44,680
Well

552
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,120
Necklace!

553
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:47,960
This necklace?

554
00:36:51,240 --> 00:36:52,640
This is so popular.

555
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:55,000
Almost everybody wears it in Hong Kong.

556
00:36:58,040 --> 00:36:59,720
I really went there alone.

557
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:05,360
I mean I was the only one from our department.

558
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:08,040
Of course, the president sent someone over.

559
00:37:08,960 --> 00:37:11,000
We slept saperately.

560
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:12,400
Are we clear?

561
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,560
But that day

562
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,280
I really saw someone there with you.

563
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,160
Me too!

564
00:37:17,640 --> 00:37:18,800
What was that?

565
00:37:19,160 --> 00:37:19,920
Yeah, What did I see?

566
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,080
Who?

567
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,320
There was really no one.

568
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,520
Who would I be with?

569
00:37:29,120 --> 00:37:30,280
I don’t want to waste anymore of your time.

570
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,280
Let's start the meeting.

571
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:34,880
I don’t need that.

572
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,440
I already went through everything.

573
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,360
As all of you know that

574
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:44,200
the Amaraporn company will celebrate its 50th anniversary soon.

575
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,800
So we will collaborate and come out with a new collection.

576
00:37:47,160 --> 00:37:48,160
The idea that I have for this collection

577
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,480
is to be more

578
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:51,760
modern.

579
00:37:52,000 --> 00:37:54,080
To help our brand’s visibility reach a newer group of customers.

580
00:37:54,920 --> 00:37:56,880
Since we are moving on to a new era of Soul High jewelry.

581
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,840
I referenced from

582
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,440
our old piece. As you can see in the folder

583
00:38:01,800 --> 00:38:03,320
in the fifth page.

584
00:38:05,080 --> 00:38:06,280
Our piece

585
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,000
needs a structural adjustment and

586
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:10,920
the design itself as well. For example, the colors.

587
00:38:11,240 --> 00:38:12,840
I want all of you

588
00:38:12,840 --> 00:38:15,360
to redesign all of our old collection.

589
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,680
Hello.

590
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,880
As you guys may already knew

591
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:30,600
that we will be working on a 50th anniversary Amaraporn’s collection.

592
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:32,840
The designs

593
00:38:32,840 --> 00:38:35,280
will be chosen at the end of next week.

594
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:39,000
I already sent the costumes that could match with the jewelry

595
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,160
in your emails.

596
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:42,560
Please check it out.

597
00:38:46,400 --> 00:38:47,200
I got it.

598
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,480
I haven’t got anything.

599
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:58,120
Me too.

600
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,520
Yeah.

601
00:38:59,880 --> 00:39:01,000
I haven’t got any as well

602
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:04,040
Did we really tell them about the interns’ emails?

603
00:39:05,120 --> 00:39:06,360
We did.

604
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:07,160
Huh..

605
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,240
We might

606
00:39:09,240 --> 00:39:11,240
just get to be their assistants.

607
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:12,680
Do you agree, friend?

608
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,440
Who’s talking to you?

609
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:16,920
I am.

610
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:19,240
P’Kaew

611
00:39:22,520 --> 00:39:25,720
can we also work in designing this project too.

612
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,840
That won’t be necessary.

613
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,280
This is a major customer

614
00:39:33,280 --> 00:39:34,760
and we will be taking care of them.

615
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:36,920
The interns don’t need to do anything.

616
00:39:37,040 --> 00:39:39,000
Just watch us working

617
00:39:39,160 --> 00:39:41,400
and experience from that.

618
00:39:44,560 --> 00:39:45,360
Er..

619
00:39:46,520 --> 00:39:48,240
As interns

620
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:54,640
will we be able to work like all of you guys?

621
00:39:55,640 --> 00:39:58,400
You’re so cute.

622
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,160
This works has time limit

623
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:05,760
and all of you still don’t really know how to use the tools correctly.

624
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,120
Are you all able to handle this?

625
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:09,640
New graduates are always eager beavers.

626
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,400
We’ll just stick to this plan for now

627
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:14,680
Everybody, let's get to work.

628
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:15,720
P’Kaew

629
00:40:18,960 --> 00:40:21,360
I think we should give everybody a chance to try.

630
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:27,920
All of us

631
00:40:27,920 --> 00:40:29,480
been through here before just like them.

632
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,840
Actually, I don’t mind at all

633
00:40:38,840 --> 00:40:40,680
but these interns

634
00:40:40,680 --> 00:40:42,360
are still learning all the working steps.

635
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:44,840
Who could help mentor them?

636
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:51,000
Isn’t that right Juladis?

637
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:53,800
Juladis!

638
00:40:54,840 --> 00:40:57,640
Juladis, can you help them?

639
00:40:58,160 --> 00:40:59,880
P’Kaew

640
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:04,360
I just took in 3 projects.

641
00:41:04,640 --> 00:41:05,680
I don’t think I can handle all of this.

642
00:41:07,160 --> 00:41:07,960
Really!

643
00:41:08,240 --> 00:41:09,520
I can’t do it all.

644
00:41:16,760 --> 00:41:18,000
I’ll help them myself.

645
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:21,280
Really?

646
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,240
That’d be great but

647
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:26,840
don’t make it affect your main work.

648
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:29,440
That won’t happen.

649
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:31,080
You’re off the hook now.

650
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,440
Let’s get going.

651
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:37,200
Goodbye/Goodbye

652
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,200
You’re the best.

653
00:41:47,600 --> 00:41:51,120
Thank you for trusting us.

654
00:41:51,960 --> 00:41:53,960
I already forwarded the email to all of you.

655
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,320
Look at the email and do it yourself.

656
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:56,880
Wait?

657
00:41:57,880 --> 00:41:59,520
Aren’t you going to teach us?

658
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:01,560
I helped with the talking

659
00:42:02,520 --> 00:42:04,400
the rest of it is your job.

660
00:42:06,040 --> 00:42:09,000
Didn’t Salin just say that you can do it?

661
00:42:12,760 --> 00:42:14,160
Thank you so much.

662
00:42:16,120 --> 00:42:17,880
We’ll do our best.

663
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:21,720
Don’t go.

664
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,160
Yay!

665
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:33,640
Yohoo!

666
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,360
Yes!

667
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,280
Come here, we must do our beat.

668
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:44,800
One, two, three, yay!

669
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:55,080
Scoffs!

670
00:42:59,080 --> 00:42:59,920
Lin,

671
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,080
have you come up with anything?

672
00:43:02,080 --> 00:43:03,720
No, not yet.

673
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:07,920
But we have P’Prim to help us.

674
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,440
Yo!

675
00:43:10,480 --> 00:43:11,320
Am I pretty?

676
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:13,760
You are.

677
00:43:13,760 --> 00:43:15,480
Good answer baby.

678
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,280
P’Prim

679
00:43:21,200 --> 00:43:22,720
May I take a little bit of your time?

680
00:43:23,240 --> 00:43:26,920
I just drafted out the design

681
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,680
but I feel like it’s missing something.

682
00:43:31,680 --> 00:43:33,240
Can you please have a look at this?

683
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,800
The concept is bad.

684
00:43:52,800 --> 00:43:53,960
Missing all the details.

685
00:43:56,680 --> 00:43:57,920
It looks like work for your teacher.

686
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:07,280
You’re right.

687
00:44:09,440 --> 00:44:10,840
Thank you so much.

688
00:44:12,560 --> 00:44:15,240
I’ll ask for your help again.

689
00:44:30,920 --> 00:44:31,720
Pim

690
00:44:32,800 --> 00:44:33,600
are you okay?

691
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:38,600
Of course, I am.

692
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:40,880
What!?

693
00:44:42,600 --> 00:44:43,360
Pim

694
00:44:43,360 --> 00:44:45,200
are you going crazy?

695
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,000
She just trashed your work.

696
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,120
It’s not called trashing but

697
00:44:52,120 --> 00:44:55,040
it’s called enlightening.

698
00:44:56,400 --> 00:44:57,960
Yo, stop bothering her.

699
00:44:59,240 --> 00:45:01,080
You’re doing this too many times.

700
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,040
But

701
00:45:03,240 --> 00:45:04,040
the right person

702
00:45:05,080 --> 00:45:06,160
will always be the right person.

703
00:45:09,200 --> 00:45:10,360
You’re right!

704
00:45:11,240 --> 00:45:14,160
what she said is a fact.

705
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,600
Wait and see!

706
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:18,440
One day

707
00:45:19,240 --> 00:45:21,000
I’ll be as good as P’Prim.

708
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:24,600
Right.

709
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:29,760
Why are you squirming around?

710
00:45:31,080 --> 00:45:31,880
Get back to work.

711
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,480
I’m just happy.

712
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,840
It’s dark outside and you’re still here.

713
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:53,800
Oh!

714
00:45:54,160 --> 00:45:54,960
P’Sun

715
00:46:03,520 --> 00:46:06,120
as a person who you are seriously in a talking stage with

716
00:46:07,920 --> 00:46:09,280
can I be mad at you?

717
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,320
Mad at me?

718
00:46:15,480 --> 00:46:16,440
Really?

719
00:46:17,920 --> 00:46:18,760
Now I’m sad.

720
00:46:20,800 --> 00:46:22,840
I’ve been waiting for you to text me back all day.

721
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:27,320
I’m sorry.

722
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:30,200
I’ve been busy fixing my design all day.

723
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,280
I haven’t really got a chance to touch my phone.

724
00:46:36,640 --> 00:46:38,200
I’m really sorry.

725
00:46:39,800 --> 00:46:41,200
Please, Please, Please.

726
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,760
Alright, I won’t be mad at you.

727
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:49,800
What are you working on?

728
00:46:50,680 --> 00:46:51,480
Have a look.

729
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:53,920
You've been working all day?

730
00:46:55,440 --> 00:46:56,680
You must be exhausted.

731
00:46:58,280 --> 00:46:59,440
Are you hungry?

732
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:00,480
i am.

733
00:47:01,080 --> 00:47:02,720
We should go eat

734
00:47:03,560 --> 00:47:05,520
and after that I’ll take you back home.

735
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:06,440
Okay?

736
00:47:06,440 --> 00:47:07,240
Yes!

737
00:47:08,360 --> 00:47:09,120
Alright.

738
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:14,160
Or should I give you some encouragement first?

739
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:15,880
Hmm?

740
00:47:20,000 --> 00:47:20,800
Lin,

741
00:47:21,160 --> 00:47:22,200
I’m back.

742
00:47:26,680 --> 00:47:28,680
Lin!

743
00:47:31,680 --> 00:47:32,560
Lin

744
00:47:32,560 --> 00:47:35,000
I’m sorry that I left you here but

745
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:36,360
because of Yo.

746
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,440
He’s really sleepy.

747
00:47:38,440 --> 00:47:39,920
Sleepy like he’s about to pass out.

748
00:47:39,920 --> 00:47:41,480
So I thought of going back in the moment

749
00:47:41,480 --> 00:47:43,280
but my consciousness

750
00:47:43,280 --> 00:47:44,880
tell me to take my friend back home.

751
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:47,240
You’re such a good friend.

752
00:47:48,120 --> 00:47:49,000
Of course, I am.

753
00:47:49,000 --> 00:47:49,720
I was being sarcastic.

754
00:47:50,600 --> 00:47:51,400
But anyway

755
00:47:52,000 --> 00:47:54,520
we’re here to sit and accompany you.

756
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:56,640
That’s right.

757
00:47:56,920 --> 00:47:59,520
Should we order something to eat?

758
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:00,640
I will go and order for us.

759
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,920
Oh no!

760
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:05,520
I mean I’m quite full

761
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,200
and I’m about to go back.

762
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:08,600
Really?

763
00:48:09,160 --> 00:48:11,280
I thought that you’re going to work until dawn.

764
00:48:11,920 --> 00:48:13,000
Unfortunately,

765
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:16,920
I forgot my glasses so my eyes’ a tiny sore.

766
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:18,800
Ahh.

767
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:20,880
Good then why don’t we go now.

768
00:48:21,320 --> 00:48:22,640
I really want to take a shower.

769
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:23,760
Guys!

770
00:48:23,760 --> 00:48:24,440
What?!

771
00:48:25,320 --> 00:48:27,280
I found my glasses.

772
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:30,600
Maybe we should keep working.

773
00:48:30,600 --> 00:48:31,160
Huh?

774
00:48:31,160 --> 00:48:32,120
What’s wrong with you?

775
00:48:32,640 --> 00:48:34,800
What do you really want? You’re confusing me.

776
00:48:40,720 --> 00:48:41,520
President!

777
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:45,840
I’ve been looking everywhere for you.

778
00:48:52,400 --> 00:48:53,200
President!

779
00:48:55,240 --> 00:48:56,240
What are you doing here?

780
00:49:01,480 --> 00:49:02,280
Ahh.

781
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:04,120
I’m here to

782
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:07,400
to check at the overall carpet

783
00:49:08,120 --> 00:49:08,920
of

784
00:49:09,400 --> 00:49:11,080
of the the/designing department!

785
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,080
designing department!

786
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,160
Check the overall carpet?

787
00:49:17,720 --> 00:49:19,240
But it is okay.

788
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:20,600
Chan, why are you looking for me?

789
00:49:20,880 --> 00:49:22,320
I have some documents for you to sign.

790
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:23,120
Ahh

791
00:49:23,880 --> 00:49:24,960
Documents

792
00:49:27,520 --> 00:49:29,040
Everyone please go home safely.

793
00:49:35,000 --> 00:49:36,200
Follow me quickly!

794
00:49:49,320 --> 00:49:50,120
Lin

795
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:00,000
Lin

796
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:00,600
Yes!

797
00:50:01,200 --> 00:50:02,000
We’re here.

798
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:06,280
I’m sorry.

799
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:08,760
I was a little bit into the series.

800
00:50:14,200 --> 00:50:15,960
Thank you for taking me home.

801
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:17,360
I’ll get going now.

802
00:50:18,200 --> 00:50:19,080
Lin

803
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,840
Yes?

804
00:50:22,080 --> 00:50:24,760
Do you really not want to eat anything?

805
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:26,440
Yes.

806
00:50:28,040 --> 00:50:30,400
I’ll walk you up to your room.

807
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,280
That’s okay.

808
00:50:35,120 --> 00:50:35,920
Err

809
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:37,800
P’Sun

810
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:41,600
I’m feeling slightly uncomfortable.

811
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:43,400
Hmm?

812
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:47,400
I’m worried that

813
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:51,160
people might see us.

814
00:50:56,240 --> 00:50:57,360
It’s because I’m being too pushy right?

815
00:51:00,960 --> 00:51:01,920
I’m sorry.

816
00:51:03,920 --> 00:51:05,280
Sorry for making you feel this way.

817
00:51:10,120 --> 00:51:11,840
I didn’t mean too.

818
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,200
From now on

819
00:51:17,000 --> 00:51:18,720
I’ll be more careful.

820
00:51:19,960 --> 00:51:20,960
Okay,

821
00:51:20,960 --> 00:51:22,400
Thanks.

822
00:51:29,360 --> 00:51:31,320
You have to promise me one thing that

823
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:33,720
no matter how busy you are

824
00:51:34,560 --> 00:51:36,400
you have to at least try to answer my text.

825
00:51:37,480 --> 00:51:38,720
Just tell me what you are doing.

826
00:51:38,720 --> 00:51:40,440
Just answer me.

827
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:43,560
That way I don’t have to worry about you.

828
00:51:43,880 --> 00:51:45,720
Yes, I promised.

829
00:51:50,160 --> 00:51:51,320
Let go off me.

830
00:51:56,040 --> 00:51:57,160
Thank you, P’Sun.

831
00:51:58,320 --> 00:51:58,840
No problem.

832
00:51:58,840 --> 00:51:59,680
Good night!

833
00:52:00,840 --> 00:52:01,600
Good night.

834
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:49,280
Mom!

835
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:51,880
What is your problem?

836
00:52:52,840 --> 00:52:53,840
Your mom owes me my money.

837
00:52:55,360 --> 00:52:56,240
Kid!

838
00:52:56,440 --> 00:52:57,960
Your mom owes us our money.

839
00:52:58,800 --> 00:52:59,680
Yotha!

840
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:01,880
if you don’t want to have a problem with me

841
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:03,640
just tell your mom to pay us back.

842
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:04,600
Yo

843
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:06,440
are you busy?

844
00:53:08,200 --> 00:53:11,040
Can I wait for my dad here?

845
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:13,600
Who’s that?

846
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:14,120
Your dad?

847
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:17,400
Yes, my dad is a police officer. His station is right around the corner.

848
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,680
Hey you!

849
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,120
Is your dad a police officer?

850
00:53:23,480 --> 00:53:26,280
Yeah, he is. His station is right there.

851
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:28,160
So what?

852
00:53:28,760 --> 00:53:29,560
Calm down!

853
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:30,720
Take it easy!

854
00:53:30,720 --> 00:53:32,840
A police! You want to get into trouble?

855
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:36,000
It’s not over.

856
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,320
I have to get my money next time.

857
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,720
You better watch your back!

858
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:45,320
Mom!

859
00:53:45,920 --> 00:53:46,760
Mom.

860
00:53:49,080 --> 00:53:50,400
Did you get hurt anywhere?

861
00:53:50,920 --> 00:53:52,640
I’m really okay.

862
00:53:55,560 --> 00:53:56,640
Thank you so much.

863
00:53:57,040 --> 00:53:57,640
That’s alright.

864
00:53:58,640 --> 00:54:00,080
Mom, go inside slowly.

865
00:54:17,800 --> 00:54:18,760
Why did you just follow me?

866
00:54:19,720 --> 00:54:21,080
I’m staying over with my cousin around here.

867
00:54:21,840 --> 00:54:22,640
Ahh

868
00:54:22,880 --> 00:54:24,960
Your cousin who's the police?

869
00:54:25,680 --> 00:54:28,240
Yeah, why are you so curious?

870
00:54:30,440 --> 00:54:31,760
I’m getting really sleepy now.

871
00:54:32,680 --> 00:54:34,360
I want to go back and sleep now.

872
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,120
Or

873
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:40,400
do you want me to stay over at your house?

874
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:41,760
I don’t mind that.

875
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:44,320
But I do.

876
00:54:47,120 --> 00:54:48,960
You’re so stingy.

877
00:54:50,720 --> 00:54:51,560
If not?

878
00:54:52,320 --> 00:54:54,320
Are you scared that you might fall for me?

879
00:54:55,240 --> 00:54:57,200
I know I’m pretty charming.

880
00:54:58,960 --> 00:54:59,920
You’re being delusional.

881
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,640
I just like to sleep alone.

882
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:12,600
About what just happened,

883
00:55:13,400 --> 00:55:14,840
can you keep it a secret?

884
00:55:15,920 --> 00:55:17,240
I just don’t want my friend to worry.

885
00:55:19,040 --> 00:55:20,920
If I do so

886
00:55:21,960 --> 00:55:22,760
what would I get?

887
00:55:23,520 --> 00:55:24,200
Really?

888
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,280
You’re being greedy!

889
00:55:26,600 --> 00:55:28,320
Or you want me to tell everyone?

890
00:55:33,600 --> 00:55:34,400
What do you want then?

891
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:35,240
You!

892
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:37,960
What?

893
00:55:38,600 --> 00:55:39,880
That was my answer.

894
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:40,720
I didn’t call you.

895
00:55:41,080 --> 00:55:42,280
The thing that I want

896
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,440
is

897
00:55:43,840 --> 00:55:44,640
You!

898
00:55:49,120 --> 00:55:51,280
You mean me?

899
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:53,320
Yes!

900
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:56,320
I meant what I said.

901
00:56:03,880 --> 00:56:04,680
Yo

902
00:56:09,040 --> 00:56:09,840
listen to me.

903
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:13,600
I want you to open up more.

904
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:16,400
You’re not only with Lin and Pim anymore.

905
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:18,000
You have me as well.

906
00:56:21,480 --> 00:56:22,280
Ahh

907
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:25,960
you want me to open up so that we can be friends?

908
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:26,960
Yes!

909
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,000
Or do you

910
00:56:28,000 --> 00:56:30,120
want me to be more than that?

911
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:31,080
Maybe like this.

912
00:56:32,520 --> 00:56:33,760
โอ๊ย

913
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:36,120
Nonsense!

914
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:38,920
If you don’t get on my nerves

915
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:44,120
maybe we could be friends.

916
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:47,200
Who always started the fight?

917
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,320
It’s you!

918
00:56:48,800 --> 00:56:49,360
See!

919
00:56:49,360 --> 00:56:49,920
It’s you!

920
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:50,200
Here we go again.

921
00:56:50,200 --> 00:56:52,120
You always be the first to annoy me!

922
00:56:55,160 --> 00:56:56,920
I really want to know

923
00:56:57,480 --> 00:56:59,680
what do you use your brain for?

924
00:57:00,160 --> 00:57:02,920
You only have it just to separate your ears or something?

925
00:57:03,200 --> 00:57:05,560
If you don’t stop

926
00:57:05,840 --> 00:57:06,720
you’ll see.

927
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:12,280
I think I’ll change my mind.

928
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:14,600
The secret that you told me to keep

929
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:16,000
I’ll tell everyone.

930
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:18,840
Fine, fine, fine.

931
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:20,480
I give up.

932
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:21,680
You’re the cutest.

933
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:23,840
You’re actually very cute.

934
00:57:24,600 --> 00:57:25,720
Let me tell you that

935
00:57:25,720 --> 00:57:26,600
I’m not actually willing to do it

936
00:57:50,120 --> 00:57:53,160
Sun : Don’t forget to take a break.

937
00:57:53,160 --> 00:57:55,360
Sun : Text me before you sleep okay?

938
00:57:55,360 --> 00:57:58,440
Sun : Send you a picture while holding two fingers.

939
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,080
Salin : Send you a picture while holding two fingers.

940
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,720
Salin : You can do it!

941
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:32,720
What am I thinking?

942
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:37,600
Calm down, Sun.

943
00:58:38,600 --> 00:58:40,600
Breath in, breathe out.

944
00:59:05,600 --> 00:59:06,400
Huh!

945
00:59:06,880 --> 00:59:08,000
How is it?

946
00:59:08,720 --> 00:59:09,480
Do you get anything done?

947
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:10,920
I still can’t come up with anything good

948
00:59:11,440 --> 00:59:12,560
but I drafted it out slightly.

949
00:59:13,160 --> 00:59:13,720
Huh?

950
00:59:13,720 --> 00:59:14,520
Lin!

951
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:16,640
Oh

952
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:18,560
you’re here?

953
00:59:20,280 --> 00:59:21,400
Since when did you get here?

954
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,520
Working till dawn again?

955
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:25,960
No.

956
00:59:26,640 --> 00:59:29,400
I’m just worried that I might not wake up in time

957
00:59:29,400 --> 00:59:31,960
so I hurried to the office.

958
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:34,480
Have you had anything for breakfast?

959
00:59:35,160 --> 00:59:35,960
Not yet.

960
00:59:36,600 --> 00:59:38,040
You’re working too hard.

961
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:39,760
Becaful of your health as well

962
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:40,960
I don’t want you to pass out.

963
00:59:40,960 --> 00:59:42,480
He’s right.

964
00:59:43,120 --> 00:59:45,720
I’m really fine.

965
00:59:47,240 --> 00:59:51,080
I bought all of you some snacks.

966
00:59:51,640 --> 00:59:53,200
This is yours.

967
00:59:53,200 --> 00:59:54,160
Thanks!

968
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:56,120
This is for you, Lin.

969
00:59:56,120 --> 00:59:57,000
Thanks to you.

970
00:59:57,760 --> 00:59:58,480
This.

971
00:59:59,080 --> 00:59:59,840
What about me?

972
01:00:00,440 --> 01:00:02,040
None, this is for me.

973
01:00:07,320 --> 01:00:10,320
I’ll get a cup of coffee and I’ll be right back.

974
01:00:10,320 --> 01:00:11,320
Do you guys want anything?

975
01:00:11,320 --> 01:00:12,000
I’m alright.

976
01:00:12,000 --> 01:00:12,800
No/No thanks.

977
01:00:13,320 --> 01:00:15,080
Have a look at my design, okay/

978
01:01:17,000 --> 01:01:19,200
Hia, this is urgent. Lin just fainted.

979
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:19,880
What?

980
01:01:20,440 --> 01:01:21,560
No need to worry.

981
01:01:22,200 --> 01:01:23,840
Salin just didn’t get enough rest.

982
01:01:23,840 --> 01:01:25,800
How are you? Did you get hurt anywhere?

983
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:26,960
I’m feeling better now.

984
01:01:27,480 --> 01:01:28,960
Yo, why are you avoiding me?

985
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:30,080
I’m not.

986
01:01:30,720 --> 01:01:31,760
You’re not that important.

987
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,440
Are you okay?

988
01:01:33,800 --> 01:01:35,600
Everything will be fine. I’m right beside you.

989
01:01:35,840 --> 01:01:37,560
Thank you so much, P’Sun.

990
01:01:37,560 --> 01:01:38,400
We knew

991
01:01:38,400 --> 01:01:40,800
who is your office guy now.
