1
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:12,760
These are the designs that we roughly drafted.

2
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,040
Those look fine.

3
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:15,480
I think it’s missing something.

4
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,400
I would like to invite Mr. Sattabun here on the stage.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,600
I have something to tell you.

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:22,600
Mr. Sattabun is…

7
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:23,920
That’s my son.

8
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:24,560
Dad!

9
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,480
I saw that she was wearing Thai silk.

10
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,000
Lin!

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,480
The same Thai silk as the one that you showed me earlier.

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,640
What happened?

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:36,200
Is the Soul High jewelry this trashy to the point that they copied design from others?

14
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,320
Did you copy the design from someone else?

15
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:38,960
I didn’t copy it from anyone.

16
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:00,920
Lin

17
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:03,400
I didn’t really copy this from anyone.

18
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:06,280
Do you believe me?

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:08,320
I trust you.

20
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,640
Don’t cry please.

21
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,560
I caused trouble.

22
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:19,360
P’Kaew told me that the company has to pay so much fine for that.

23
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:22,760
I’m so sorry.

24
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:24,800
I really didn’t mean for this to happen.

25
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:27,960
I’m really sorry.

26
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:32,479
Lin, look at me.

27
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:41,759
Everything will be okay.

28
00:01:45,320 --> 00:01:46,120
You don’t wave to worry, okay?

29
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:50,680
I’m really sorry again.

30
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:03,240
I really didn’t mean to.

31
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,200
Hello.

32
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:03,760
I need your help.

33
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:06,960
Alright!

34
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:08,960
I’ll get that done for you.

35
00:04:10,880 --> 00:04:11,680
See you!

36
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:31,440
Did I just wake you up?

37
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:36,840
P’Sun, what time is it now?

38
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:40,680
It’s 07.45 A.M. now.

39
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,640
I’ll be late.

40
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,200
Lin

41
00:04:44,120 --> 00:04:45,040
you need to lie down.

42
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,880
You were fidgeting around all night last night.

43
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:49,960
You can just rest today.

44
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:51,800
That’s alright.

45
00:04:51,800 --> 00:04:54,400
I think I should get to the designing department.

46
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:55,000
Lin!

47
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:57,120
Don’t be stubborn.

48
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:00,520
I already took a sick leave for you.

49
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:03,400
Let say your work is

50
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,480
just to get a new design done.

51
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,240
Alright?

52
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,120
Do I have any other choice?

53
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:11,800
I’m rooting for you.

54
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,520
I know you can do it.

55
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:22,640
There’s no way that it’s possible for Lin to copy someone.

56
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:23,880
That’s right.

57
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:27,320
The whole situation is very suspicious.

58
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:31,680
Or maybe someone stole Lin’s design?

59
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,880
And how did it get to a business rival?

60
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:35,400
I’m curious about it too.

61
00:05:37,760 --> 00:05:46,159
Is there like an imposter disguised among us?

62
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,200
Is that right?

63
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,360
Are we in Among Us or something?

64
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,920
I think the person who was able to steal Lin’s design.

65
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:56,200
That person must have seen Lin’s work before.

66
00:05:56,840 --> 00:05:57,480
Right?

67
00:05:57,720 --> 00:05:58,360
Right?

68
00:05:58,360 --> 00:05:59,000
True that!

69
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:03,760
Or that is the one?

70
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:07,720
Juladis, the Hiso wannabe.

71
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:10,200
I think he’s in need of some money.

72
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,400
You’re insane.

73
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,280
He’s a son of one of the executive members.

74
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:17,880
I don’t think money won’t be his problem

75
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:18,840
You’re right.

76
00:06:24,440 --> 00:06:25,120
Or that person is…

77
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:26,680
Primrada.

78
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,640
I don’t think that she is that kind of person.

79
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:33,520
She’s an artist herself

80
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,960
I don’t think she would do stuff like this to degrade herself.

81
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:38,360
That’s left us with one person.

82
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:39,600
Who is it?

83
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:43,200
P’Kaewmanee

84
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:50,600
I remembered that P’Kaew is the one who asked Lin to give the file to her only.

85
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:52,680
Salin, don’t forget to give me the file.

86
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,720
Alright.

87
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,240
You can just send it to me directly.

88
00:06:56,760 --> 00:06:59,040
I’m going to give it to them myself, since I’m going to the main building anyway.

89
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:05,360
Right? Because normally she won’t ask for anyone’s file to send it to herself.

90
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,000
Isn’t that right?

91
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:55,120
Hey! Look! Look! Look!

92
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:58,480
Is that hiso Allie, the president’s fiance?

93
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:00,320
Right, you’re right!

94
00:08:00,320 --> 00:08:03,560
I saw the picture that Madame Wang posted.

95
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:09,520
President, Miss…

96
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:10,760
Hi

97
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,160
Hello, Allie.

98
00:08:16,040 --> 00:08:17,960
You don’t have to come here all the way yourself.

99
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,760
You rarely accepted my appointment.

100
00:08:20,480 --> 00:08:22,240
How could I not come here myself?

101
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:24,200
Here you go.

102
00:08:29,920 --> 00:08:31,760
Thanks for the card.

103
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:33,919
Aren’t you going to ask me to sit?

104
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,919
I’m sorry about that

105
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,000
but I have like 3 minutes left and then I’m going to a meeting.

106
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,880
But..

107
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,360
the day that we scheduled I have a whole day for you.

108
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:50,840
You may have a seat.

109
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,560
But excuse-me.

110
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:55,160
I have to go now.

111
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:04,120
I’m counting for the day.

112
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,000
Okay.

113
00:09:57,240 --> 00:09:58,400
You’re not finding anything!

114
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,600
Are you really looking well?

115
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:04,800
I’m going to go looking for it upstairs.

116
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:07,360
If you find anything suspicious,

117
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,520
call me right away!

118
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:12,120
Okay.

119
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:48,880
Yo!

120
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:56,480
We need to find the key.

121
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:15,400
Yo,

122
00:11:17,480 --> 00:11:18,280
Yo.

123
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,640
P’Sun, What are you doing?

124
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,600
You’ve been sitting here for hours now.

125
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:39,880
I’m still working.

126
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:42,360
Then, I’m going to give you a massage.

127
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,680
You know what.

128
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,440
My grandfather used to always tell me that whoever I gave a massage to,

129
00:13:50,080 --> 00:13:52,360
It’s like they have recharged their energy fully.

130
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:53,920
See?

131
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:55,760
You’re here giving me a massage.

132
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:57,880
Are you almost done with your work?

133
00:13:59,200 --> 00:14:00,000
Of course, it’s nearly done.

134
00:14:01,160 --> 00:14:03,160
I just want to give my eyes a rest from all the work.

135
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,640
Hmm?

136
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:13,160
What is it? Didn’t you say that you were going to give your eyes a rest?

137
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,640
Why are you staring at me like that?

138
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,280
I’m doing it. I’m resting my eyes now.

139
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,800
What a beautiful sight to the eyes.

140
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,040
You’re actually very handsome when you’re smiling.

141
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,880
I know that.

142
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:37,720
See, if you’re frowning a lot. You may get wrinkles.

143
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,440
You won’t be as handsome anymore.

144
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,120
I got you now.

145
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,520
So, what are you working on?

146
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,240
I’m just listing all the diamond factories.

147
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:51,200
Do you want me to help you with anything?

148
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,720
Ooh!

149
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,480
What’s wrong?

150
00:15:31,200 --> 00:15:32,120
Why are you looking at me?

151
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:34,440
If you’re going to stare like that,

152
00:15:34,680 --> 00:15:36,200
why don’t you just ask away.

153
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:37,960
It’s nothing.

154
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:42,960
I just want to know what the president will say after seeing this.

155
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,960
He says nothing.

156
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:48,640
How do you have his personal Line account?

157
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,400
Do you really have to know everything?

158
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:52,640
Ahh!

159
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:57,680
I get it now. A person like you must’ve already sucked up to the president already.

160
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,160
You’re just like P’Juladis.

161
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,000
Yo,

162
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:05,680
let me ask you something.

163
00:16:06,280 --> 00:16:09,520
If I’m not who I am like the one you know.

164
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,800
What do you mean by that?

165
00:16:11,960 --> 00:16:13,680
If you’re not who you are.

166
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,000
Asumming..

167
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:19,520
Assuming that I’m the other son of Madame Wang

168
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,840
or a little brother of the president.

169
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:26,440
Would you still keep arguing with me like this?

170
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,240
Huhh!

171
00:16:29,280 --> 00:16:33,080
Seriously, if you want to be rich,

172
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:34,960
you should maybe get some lotteries.

173
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:36,800
Maybe you’ll actually be rich that way.

174
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,480
Why are the numbers right here are not the same

175
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,560
as the quotations that I got from the suppliers?

176
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:06,400
This was approved by the purchasing department.

177
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,800
All I did was just documented it in the company’s account.

178
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,040
There were changes in the specs of materials. Didn’t you also document those?

179
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:16,400
I’m really sorry, president.

180
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:22,599
That was very reckless of me and about the changement is specs. I have no idea about that.

181
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:24,720
It probably happened after it was documented.

182
00:17:25,040 --> 00:17:27,319
At that point I was already turned in the document.

183
00:17:29,560 --> 00:17:30,360
So you know about this?

184
00:17:31,680 --> 00:17:32,920
I kinda know about this.

185
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,200
And you just let things go like that?

186
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,040
I’m so sorry.

187
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:41,800
I got that.

188
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,240
If you’re really have to fixing all the mistakes of all the cases,

189
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:46,920
it would probably add up to you a lot.

190
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:49,880
How about this?

191
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:54,480
I want to suspend all the purchases from the suppliers for about two weeks.

192
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:01,080
Please notify all of them that there’s a change in our policy.

193
00:18:01,920 --> 00:18:03,720
So I would like to renegotiate everything.

194
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,360
Can you take care of that for me?

195
00:18:05,920 --> 00:18:07,400
Of course, president.

196
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,280
Do you know anything about file sharing in the designing department?

197
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:22,440
I’m sorry, what?

198
00:18:23,400 --> 00:18:26,240
If there was a design leaked to

199
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:29,680
or rivals like how could it be leaked like that?

200
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:42,600
Are you relaxed?

201
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,360
It feels so good, Khun Dad.

202
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,360
The water is perfectly warmed.

203
00:19:02,200 --> 00:19:03,320
You look so comfy.

204
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,600
What is it?

205
00:19:12,840 --> 00:19:13,640
I…

206
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:16,200
I’m just curious.

207
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:19,960
About whatt?

208
00:19:20,840 --> 00:19:21,880
You can ask me.

209
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,680
I just want to know that

210
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:29,600
when you decided to come to Thailand.

211
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:33,360
Did you come back just because

212
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:39,480
you have to take the position as the president or…

213
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:45,960
you came back because you wanted to see me?

214
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,200
I’m not like prioritizing myself or anything.

215
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:51,520
I just want to know.

216
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:54,920
It’s actually because of both of the reasons.

217
00:19:57,920 --> 00:19:58,720
The first reason was

218
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,160
I was talking to you for a while

219
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:06,880
so surely I really wanted to meet with you.

220
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,200
The secon reason

221
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,200
was just like you said.

222
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,960
Soul is everything to our family.

223
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:26,840
It’s a business that really set my family up.

224
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:31,960
Once my dad had passed away.

225
00:20:35,160 --> 00:20:36,640
My mother had to take over.

226
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:40,840
Both the business and me.

227
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,640
At that time I looked at

228
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:47,040
the decreasing of our sales and

229
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:49,800
my mother is also getting older.

230
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,600
I thought that she deserved to rest.

231
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,000
What is your next move then?

232
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:02,640
Soul has remained the same for 10 years now.

233
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:07,200
I want to bring fame back to Soul again

234
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:10,120
just like my dad did.

235
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
So I have to adapt to the modernity

236
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,040
and also be more versatile.

237
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:21,360
The upcoming world jewelry

238
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:24,960
is my first goal.

239
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:33,560
I’m afraid that I can’t do it.

240
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:36,520
I’m just afraid.

241
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,640
There’s nothing to be afraid of.

242
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:41,720
You can do it.

243
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:43,680
You’re so talented.

244
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
I believe in you.

245
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:54,360
All you have to do is do your best.

246
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,400
Don’t put a lot of pressure on yourself.

247
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,120
Okay?

248
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,440
Yes

249
00:22:05,720 --> 00:22:06,920
What are you doing?

250
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,880
I know that you’re stressed.

251
00:22:12,760 --> 00:22:14,080
So I want to help you with that.

252
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:24,400
Then…

253
00:22:27,040 --> 00:22:27,840
You should bathe quickly

254
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:29,880
so that you can sleep early tonight.

255
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:32,480
I’m going to wait for you outside.

256
00:22:36,160 --> 00:22:37,200
Khun Dad, wait.

257
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:43,720
Can you bathe me please?

258
00:22:45,920 --> 00:22:47,520
Do you really want to try me like that?

259
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:53,760
In that case, I might have to teach you some lessons.

260
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:07,240
Yo,

261
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,560
What do you think?

262
00:24:09,960 --> 00:24:11,440
I’m thinking what you’re thinking.

263
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:12,960
Right?

264
00:24:13,760 --> 00:24:15,400
What are you two talking about?

265
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,520
Duh! You literally know nothing.

266
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,720
What is it then?

267
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:25,560
Were you really sending everything to the president?

268
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,680
Of course!

269
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,640
How can P’Kaew still act normal now?

270
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:37,760
Or we just misunderstood things.

271
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:39,560
No! No!

272
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:43,800
It was pretty clear that the specs are different.

273
00:24:44,080 --> 00:24:46,720
Even interns like us can figure that out.

274
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:51,400
He’s the president. How can he really not know about this stuff?

275
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,800
Are you trying to be funny? There’s no way that  he won’t figure this out.

276
00:24:56,800 --> 00:25:00,320
This is such a huge problem. Why is he taking this matter so slowly?

277
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:04,440
That’s right! Our fate is in P’kaew’s hand.

278
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,320
Oh! Is this for real?

279
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:13,040
P’Sun

280
00:25:13,920 --> 00:25:17,080
Er… Where are you taking me to?

281
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:20,040
This is not the way to the office.

282
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,520
And who told you that I’m taking you to the office?

283
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,640
So where are you taking me to now?

284
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:35,720
We’re here to see Madame Amaraporn.

285
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:57,240
Lin,

286
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,920
wait for me right here, alright?

287
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:14,520
Good Morning, Madame Amaraporn.

288
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,880
I’m Suriyen from Soul High jewelry.

289
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:24,560
Right, a son of Madame Wang.

290
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:26,960
How can you get in here?

291
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,120
This belongs to my granddaughter.

292
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:49,720
I’m really sorry about that but I need to do this

293
00:26:51,040 --> 00:26:52,920
because I don’t want you to misunderstand us.

294
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,080
This is the original design that was designed by Salin.

295
00:27:06,800 --> 00:27:09,280
He’s working for Soul High jewelry.

296
00:27:09,280 --> 00:27:11,360
Since the problem got to this point,

297
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
I won’t be making any excuses.

298
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,440
I just want to ask you one thing.

299
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,760
I would love for you to reconsider this new design.

300
00:27:31,800 --> 00:27:32,960
This new one.

301
00:27:40,280 --> 00:27:41,840
If it really what you said,

302
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:47,480
the design that has an issue shouldn't be put on the show.

303
00:27:49,520 --> 00:27:50,320
Right.

304
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:56,080
The 50th anniversary of Amaraporn must not have any accusations.

305
00:27:56,840 --> 00:27:58,040
This is quite interesting.

306
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:00,400
Change the concept but also still match

307
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:03,960
with the clothes from this collection.

308
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:06,880
But…

309
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,280
Who is the designer?

310
00:28:19,280 --> 00:28:21,280
Here he is, Salin.

311
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:25,400
The same designer as the old one.

312
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:31,280
Good morning.

313
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
Is something wrong?

314
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,640
No, nothing.

315
00:28:52,840 --> 00:28:54,320
Your design is exceptional.

316
00:28:56,760 --> 00:28:59,840
Alright, I think..

317
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,920
I’ll give another chance

318
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,280
to the Soul High jewelry.

319
00:29:10,160 --> 00:29:11,680
But under one condition

320
00:29:13,640 --> 00:29:17,040
that Salin has to be a model for Amaraporn.

321
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:26,160
P’Sun,

322
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:30,800
I’ve never had any experience in modeling before.

323
00:29:30,960 --> 00:29:34,680
I’m afraid that I might ruin her work.

324
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:36,400
If you’re not really sure about this

325
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
I will say no for you.

326
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,160
P’Sun, wait.

327
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:42,800
Er…

328
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:47,880
If you do that I think

329
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,240
she might reconsider our design again.

330
00:29:52,160 --> 00:29:55,360
And it will cause more trouble for your company.

331
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,440
That’s fine with me.

332
00:30:00,680 --> 00:30:01,480
But honestly,

333
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:04,960
I want to see you in sexy clothes

334
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,720
with the necklace that you designed.

335
00:30:11,760 --> 00:30:12,960
You would look so sexy.

336
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,480
P’Sun!

337
00:30:17,480 --> 00:30:18,160
I think…

338
00:30:18,800 --> 00:30:20,080
if she already made her decision

339
00:30:20,640 --> 00:30:21,480
then you’re the one for the collection.

340
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:24,800
If you want to try, don’t overthink.

341
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:26,040
Just do it.

342
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:29,680
I alway believe in you that you will do your best.

343
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:32,480
And the outcome will turn out good.

344
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,800
Congratulations to you Lin.

345
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,880
I’m so proud of you.

346
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:49,120
Not only you designed the jewelry

347
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:53,040
but also model yourself.

348
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:55,640
He did all of that in a day.

349
00:30:56,240 --> 00:30:57,960
Excellent! Outstanding! Superb!

350
00:30:58,120 --> 00:31:01,600
One day if you’re getting famous, don’t forget about me.

351
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,520
The news travels so fast.

352
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,160
But…

353
00:31:06,160 --> 00:31:11,920
If Madame sees me first she would probably ask me to be a model instead.

354
00:31:12,880 --> 00:31:13,520
But stll…

355
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:15,600
congratulations.

356
00:31:16,600 --> 00:31:17,760
Thanks.

357
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:18,480
You’re welcome.

358
00:31:18,480 --> 00:31:19,000
Lin!

359
00:31:20,080 --> 00:31:21,800
The secretary of the president asked me

360
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:24,200
to tell you that you need to be fitting in this afternoon.

361
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,560
Isn’t that scheduled for tomorrow?

362
00:31:27,640 --> 00:31:29,000
Maybe the clothes are done earlier?

363
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,840
You should just hurry, Madame really wants to see you.

364
00:31:44,320 --> 00:31:45,120
Good afternoon.

365
00:31:45,840 --> 00:31:46,640
Good afternoon.

366
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,200
Good afternoon to you two as well.

367
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:52,000
Thank you for coming today.

368
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,040
But you’re here just to do the fitting.

369
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,040
Mr. Suriyen has to come here himself?

370
00:32:01,000 --> 00:32:02,840
Ahh? Yes.

371
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:05,120
I just want to make sure that

372
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:08,160
everything will be perfect for you.

373
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,160
Hearing you say that makes me feel at ease.

374
00:32:15,520 --> 00:32:16,080
Madame,

375
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:17,800
I have a question.

376
00:32:18,240 --> 00:32:22,840
What is the reason that you chose Lin as your model?

377
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,480
I just really have a good feeling

378
00:32:27,280 --> 00:32:28,680
about him but I can’t really describe it.

379
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:32,480
It’s the same good feeling I have with you.

380
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:36,400
Er..

381
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:43,080
Let me introduce, this is Rita, Our best designer.

382
00:32:43,840 --> 00:32:45,360
Hello/Hello

383
00:32:46,160 --> 00:32:49,400
The clothes are ready. Salin, this way please.

384
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,200
Okay.

385
00:32:52,560 --> 00:32:53,520
This way please.

386
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:58,920
Have a seat.

387
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:00,000
Thanks.

388
00:33:01,120 --> 00:33:02,200
Have a seat first.

389
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,640
These are your clothes.

390
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:15,800
You can try it on.

391
00:33:16,280 --> 00:33:19,720
And call me in if you need my help.

392
00:33:19,720 --> 00:33:21,040
I’m going to wait for you outside.

393
00:33:21,360 --> 00:33:22,120
Thank you.

394
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,000
Salin is ready now.

395
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:07,760
Is that okay for you?

396
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:13,000
I really choose the right person for the right job.

397
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:15,680
I’m happy now.

398
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,280
Let's just go with this one.

399
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:19,040
Alright, Madame.

400
00:35:20,120 --> 00:35:22,240
Let’s go and get change, Salin.

401
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:24,320
Thank you.

402
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:38,560
About the jewelry,

403
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,400
will it finish in time?

404
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,000
Of course, it will.

405
00:35:45,040 --> 00:35:45,520
But…

406
00:35:46,440 --> 00:35:48,240
The clothes that just we did the fitting with

407
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:51,960
I would like to borrow the clothes.

408
00:35:52,440 --> 00:35:54,800
Because I want to use it to do fitting again once the jewelry is done.

409
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:56,200
So that we don’t have to waste anymore time

410
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:57,840
on the actual day.

411
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,000
Of course, you can take it.

412
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,720
And if there is anything that you’d

413
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:05,480
like to fix, you can contact Rita directly.

414
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:07,480
Thank you.

415
00:36:07,480 --> 00:36:07,840
That’s fine.

416
00:36:07,840 --> 00:36:09,360
Then I’ll see you soon.

417
00:36:09,360 --> 00:36:10,040
See you.

418
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:10,520
Thans!

419
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:27,840
P’Sun,

420
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,120
just a second.

421
00:36:55,840 --> 00:36:58,400
Other people might see us.

422
00:36:58,800 --> 00:36:59,600
No one will see us.

423
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:01,960
They already went back.

424
00:37:10,240 --> 00:37:10,720
So…

425
00:37:11,840 --> 00:37:13,080
what do you want to do to me?

426
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,040
Look at you!

427
00:37:21,960 --> 00:37:23,080
I can’t hold it anymore.

428
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:27,960
Khun Dad like this kind of clothes?

429
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,040
Too bad that you’re going to have to wear this for the photoshoot

430
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,200
because I want to rip it out of your body now.

431
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:23,320
The way that you're looking at me,

432
00:38:25,320 --> 00:38:26,760
what do you want?

433
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:09,760
Bro!

434
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:16,640
What?! Where is he?

435
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:23,680
Hello Bro, where are you?

436
00:39:25,080 --> 00:39:27,280
I want to talk with you about the document of Kaewmanee.

437
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:30,040
I’m in your office now

438
00:39:30,400 --> 00:39:31,360
but there’s no one here.

439
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,000
Chan isn’t here as well.

440
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,280
What?!

441
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:35,600
Bro!

442
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:37,200
What is he up to?

443
00:39:39,840 --> 00:39:40,480
Sun!

444
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:41,520
Sounds very familiar?

445
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:42,680
Sun,are you there?

446
00:39:42,800 --> 00:39:43,400
Mom!

447
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:51,680
Eh?

448
00:39:52,680 --> 00:39:53,800
He’s not here, Where is he?

449
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:01,920
Where is sun?

450
00:40:02,840 --> 00:40:04,200
Khun Sun?

451
00:40:04,200 --> 00:40:07,720
Oh! I think he’s in a meeting now.

452
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:09,400
Yeah, I think he has a meeting.

453
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:11,120
Yeah, that’s right. A meeting.

454
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:13,680
Seems like the meeting is over./What is it?

455
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:16,480
Mom!

456
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,160
What are you doing here?

457
00:40:20,680 --> 00:40:23,880
I’m here to see you and to check on you as well.

458
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:26,760
I’m fine.

459
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,880
I’m totally good.

460
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:30,480
You don’t have to worry about me.

461
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,640
If it gets too hard, you have to tell me.

462
00:40:34,320 --> 00:40:36,400
So that I can go and get Sam to help you.

463
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,800
I called him several times

464
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:41,720
but he never answered my call.

465
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:44,120
Once I see him I’ll be sure to beat his ass.

466
00:40:49,400 --> 00:40:50,120
Mom! Mom! Over here.

467
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:52,360
Look at those flowers!

468
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:53,560
Flowers?

469
00:40:54,000 --> 00:40:55,160
Do you want me to get rid of them?

470
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:56,040
You hate them right?

471
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:57,280
I’ll get rid of all of them.

472
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,400
Because I don’t think they look beautiful.

473
00:41:01,120 --> 00:41:03,160
I’ll change this just for you.

474
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:04,840
I’ve just made a new deal to renovate here.

475
00:41:05,560 --> 00:41:07,160
And here we have a new counter as well.

476
00:41:10,400 --> 00:41:11,080
Who is that?

477
00:41:11,440 --> 00:41:11,920
Er…

478
00:41:17,560 --> 00:41:18,080
Er..

479
00:41:18,480 --> 00:41:20,360
That was

480
00:41:27,480 --> 00:41:28,280
Follow her!

481
00:41:29,320 --> 00:41:30,080
You got that!

482
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,440
Which one is it?

483
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,120
I think this one looks okay.

484
00:41:37,080 --> 00:41:38,120
Do you want me to make a draft just like this?

485
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:39,040
yeah, I want it just like this.

486
00:41:39,360 --> 00:41:40,360
I’m going to check on this one first.

487
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:40,960
Okay.

488
00:41:45,600 --> 00:41:46,480
What are you doing?

489
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,520
Yo,

490
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:54,880
is there anything that I can help you with?

491
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:56,640
Yes, there is one thing.

492
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,400
Can you help me by leaving me alone for now?

493
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:02,000
I’m just trying to help you.

494
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,240
I know

495
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:06,400
but I need to concentrate.

496
00:42:07,840 --> 00:42:08,520
Have a look at this.

497
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:11,200
What is that?

498
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:19,840
Go do your own work!

499
00:42:19,960 --> 00:42:21,560
Didn’t you say that you need concentration?

500
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:23,600
I’m right now.

501
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:24,600
See?

502
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:27,320
I have to get this done in time.

503
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:29,160
Fine/You go get your work done, okay?

504
00:42:29,160 --> 00:42:30,360
Alright, Okay./Thanks.

505
00:42:40,200 --> 00:42:41,000
CEO!

506
00:42:42,960 --> 00:42:44,880
Hello.

507
00:42:53,640 --> 00:42:54,200
Sam!

508
00:42:54,560 --> 00:42:56,280
Didn’t you say to leave you alone?

509
00:42:57,200 --> 00:42:57,840
Sam!

510
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,280
What is your problem?

511
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,440
What are you doing here?

512
00:43:12,120 --> 00:43:13,840
Hello, Madame Wang.

513
00:43:14,480 --> 00:43:16,280
Is there anything that I can help you with?

514
00:43:24,320 --> 00:43:27,240
Ahh! This is one of our new interns.

515
00:43:27,640 --> 00:43:30,080
So he still might be new to this kind of stuff.

516
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:33,440
If there is anything that you don’t like I can deal him with now

517
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,080
because normally I’m in charge of them.

518
00:43:35,080 --> 00:43:37,760
I already hit them to punish here and there before.

519
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:39,480
I’ll do that for you if you want.

520
00:43:40,200 --> 00:43:41,480
An intern?

521
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:43,440
Yes, an intern.

522
00:43:44,440 --> 00:43:44,920
Sam!

523
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,440
Follow Mom to the president room.

524
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:50,360
Mom?

525
00:43:54,640 --> 00:43:55,520
Can’t you hear me?

526
00:43:55,680 --> 00:43:57,960
Follow Mom to the president room now.

527
00:44:22,720 --> 00:44:24,760
Why won’t you tell me that you’re back already?

528
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:27,760
Er…

529
00:44:27,760 --> 00:44:29,480
And why did you have to be an intern in the designing department?

530
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:33,840
It’s because of me

531
00:44:35,600 --> 00:44:37,000
I asked him to do that.

532
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:39,080
Please don’t blame him.

533
00:44:40,080 --> 00:44:43,200
That’s right. I’m here to help him.

534
00:44:43,600 --> 00:44:45,800
So why does it have to be the designing department?

535
00:44:46,840 --> 00:44:48,880
Because when I went through all the documents of Soul

536
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,560
and realized that our sales were decreasing.

537
00:44:53,560 --> 00:44:54,480
One of the reason because

538
00:44:55,080 --> 00:44:56,680
we only had the same pattern.

539
00:44:57,640 --> 00:44:59,360
We also only had old customers.

540
00:45:00,120 --> 00:45:02,120
So I sent Sam to the designing department.

541
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:05,200
I want him to learn what’s in there.

542
00:45:07,360 --> 00:45:08,320
How long has it been?

543
00:45:09,040 --> 00:45:10,280
Around 2 months now.

544
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:11,640
2 months!

545
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:15,320
It’s been 2 months already and you never come to see me?

546
00:45:16,840 --> 00:45:20,480
Mom! I miss you like crazy

547
00:45:21,160 --> 00:45:23,240
but due to the mission that I got.

548
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,480
P’Sun has asked me to keep in between me and him.

549
00:45:29,120 --> 00:45:30,600
I’m not going to scold you or anything

550
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:34,760
but since you’re already here. You can just join as an executive member.

551
00:45:34,880 --> 00:45:35,360
What?

552
00:45:36,320 --> 00:45:37,160
Are you joking?

553
00:45:38,080 --> 00:45:39,560
I’m not known for my humor.

554
00:45:41,080 --> 00:45:41,560
Chan,

555
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:44,440
I want you to make it official that

556
00:45:44,440 --> 00:45:48,040
Sam is now the head of production.

557
00:45:48,720 --> 00:45:49,800
I will take care of that/Mom!

558
00:45:50,200 --> 00:45:51,440
Mom, this can wait.

559
00:45:52,920 --> 00:45:53,440
Mom!

560
00:46:00,080 --> 00:46:00,600
Bro!

561
00:46:01,880 --> 00:46:02,760
Can you go talk with her?

562
00:46:03,600 --> 00:46:04,400
That’s fine.

563
00:46:05,600 --> 00:46:08,880
Since you already want to be here anyway.

564
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:10,600
Just go with the flow.

565
00:46:11,120 --> 00:46:12,720
What do you mean?

566
00:46:13,200 --> 00:46:14,560
My tears are about to flow now.

567
00:46:15,760 --> 00:46:16,320
Mom!

568
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:17,200
What?

569
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:18,760
Mom, wait for me please.

570
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,640
Bro!

571
00:46:20,200 --> 00:46:20,840
Bro!

572
00:46:20,840 --> 00:46:21,320
Mom?

573
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:23,520
Argh!

574
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:33,720
Pim!

575
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,720
Is Yo really going to be okay?

576
00:46:41,040 --> 00:46:42,680
I don’t think so

577
00:46:43,600 --> 00:46:47,640
since the two of them like to tease each other.

578
00:46:52,640 --> 00:46:57,320
Yo! Yo! Yo! Yo!

579
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:02,360
Yo, can I have a word with you?

580
00:47:04,520 --> 00:47:04,960
Er…

581
00:47:05,960 --> 00:47:07,760
I’m really sorry but I have to get my work done. Mr.Sam.

582
00:47:10,320 --> 00:47:13,560
Oh wow!

583
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,000
I was wondering why an intern

584
00:47:16,760 --> 00:47:19,440
dressed this good.

585
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:20,960
Everbody!

586
00:47:21,520 --> 00:47:24,320
I would like to apologize for what happened.

587
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,400
Apologize for the fact that I didn’t tell you all the truth.

588
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:29,880
I didn’t have any hidden agenda or anything

589
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:33,240
I just want you all to treat me like I’m just an intern Sam.

590
00:47:33,720 --> 00:47:34,680
Not someone else.

591
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:40,640
But now I have a new role in a company.

592
00:47:41,560 --> 00:47:42,840
I hope that

593
00:47:43,880 --> 00:47:44,880
our relationship will remain the same

594
00:47:45,760 --> 00:47:47,040
just like when I worked here.

595
00:47:49,120 --> 00:47:49,920
Alright.

596
00:47:52,680 --> 00:47:53,560
Then,

597
00:47:54,320 --> 00:47:55,680
excuse-me.

598
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:01,520
Take care, P’Jul.

599
00:48:01,520 --> 00:48:01,960
Of course.

600
00:48:37,280 --> 00:48:38,000
P’Prim!

601
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:39,920
Are you on your way back?

602
00:48:40,400 --> 00:48:43,000
Or are you going down to do more work?

603
00:48:44,760 --> 00:48:45,760
Do you want me to carry these for you?

604
00:48:48,120 --> 00:48:48,680
No need to.

605
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:53,280
You must go down to work more.

606
00:48:53,680 --> 00:48:55,440
Let me help you.

607
00:48:56,440 --> 00:48:57,320
You can just go.

608
00:49:00,880 --> 00:49:02,560
Aren't you really not gonna let me help ypo?

609
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,840
I don’t know what kind of work I’ve been doing all day.

610
00:49:05,840 --> 00:49:06,880
It’s no fun at all.

611
00:49:07,560 --> 00:49:10,160
Also I didn’t get to develop any of my skills.

612
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:12,360
And…

613
00:49:13,080 --> 00:49:15,880
As my way to apologize to you.

614
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:17,960
Please?

615
00:49:19,320 --> 00:49:20,680
Let me help you, please?

616
00:49:22,280 --> 00:49:22,840
Please? Please?

617
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:24,480
Out of the way!

618
00:49:26,240 --> 00:49:26,800
No!

619
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:29,000
No matter what it takes

620
00:49:29,280 --> 00:49:31,040
I’m going to help you today.

621
00:50:01,400 --> 00:50:02,200
P’Prim!

622
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:06,320
Are you in pain?

623
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:08,040
Are you okay?

624
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:23,880
Come one, let me help you.

625
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:24,800
No need to.

626
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:27,520
Thai’s fine I can…

627
00:50:28,680 --> 00:50:29,440
Give that to me.

628
00:50:30,040 --> 00:50:31,800
But I think it would be better if I help you.

629
00:50:31,800 --> 00:50:32,920
No! I will do it myself.

630
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:46,680
I’m really sorry.

631
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:48,720
I didn’t mean to.

632
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:55,040
Which ones are you sorry about?

633
00:50:57,960 --> 00:50:59,960
If you really feel sorry,

634
00:51:01,400 --> 00:51:03,880
you need to stop disturbing me.

635
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:07,960
And this isn’t the first time

636
00:51:08,840 --> 00:51:10,600
that you caused me trouble.

637
00:51:11,320 --> 00:51:12,320
I just…

638
00:51:12,520 --> 00:51:13,800
You’re a grown up now.

639
00:51:15,120 --> 00:51:18,000
The fact that you have to run around and ask for them to teach you work.

640
00:51:18,520 --> 00:51:20,280
It will not make you become better.

641
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:24,960
You need to be able to be responsible for yourself.

642
00:51:26,240 --> 00:51:27,360
The work that you said you would get it done.

643
00:51:27,920 --> 00:51:28,560
Are you finished with them?

644
00:51:30,840 --> 00:51:31,520
I…

645
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:33,520
I really tried.

646
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:34,440
But..

647
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:38,000
I didn’t know how to do it.

648
00:51:39,840 --> 00:51:41,480
It’s because you didn’t try hard enough.

649
00:51:43,640 --> 00:51:44,880
Leave me alone now.

650
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:46,400
I have more work that I have to get into.

651
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,640
Lin! Lin!

652
00:53:21,800 --> 00:53:25,080
Doctor, when is Lin going to be awake?

653
00:53:25,560 --> 00:53:27,480
I can’t really tell you that

654
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:30,320
because everything seems normal to me.

655
00:53:31,880 --> 00:53:32,640
Who are you?

656
00:53:33,560 --> 00:53:34,640
I am…

657
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:36,720
It depends on the patient now

658
00:53:37,800 --> 00:53:39,000
when he’s ready he’ll be awake.
