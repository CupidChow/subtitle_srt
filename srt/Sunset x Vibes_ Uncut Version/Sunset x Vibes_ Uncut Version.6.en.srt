1
00:00:12,280 --> 00:00:14,880
Since all of you already knew about me and Lin,

2
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,200
I want all of you to keep this as a secret.

3
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:18,480
I’m really sorry today.

4
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,560
Sorry for making everyone find out about us.

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:21,800
You okay. now?

6
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:22,680
About Lin?

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,600
I’m just worried for my friend. That’s all.

8
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,440
Lin really prioritizes your and Pim’s feelings.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,200
I think you’re the one for me.

10
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:30,960
I can’t keep on waiting any longer.

11
00:00:31,360 --> 00:00:32,759
Will you be my boyfriend?

12
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:17,920
It’s here again?

13
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:22,800
Brother!

14
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:24,920
Brother!

15
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:27,280
Who’s that?

16
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:29,560
Who are you?

17
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:32,400
What do I need to do to make you love me?

18
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,240
Salin, I need your help.

19
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:41,039
Don’t come close to me!

20
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,840
I had the same dream again?

21
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,079
1 Day ealirer

22
00:03:13,080 --> 00:03:14,200
What is it, P’Sun?

23
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,040
I hope everything’s going well for you today.

24
00:03:20,920 --> 00:03:21,720
Thanks

25
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,480
I’m going to work now.

26
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,079
Right.

27
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Bye bye.

28
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,320
Wait, Lin.

29
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:36,840
Yes?

30
00:03:38,960 --> 00:03:39,760
Don’t you need this with you?

31
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,040
Ahh, I already made this into a file.

32
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,480
So I don’t really need this.

33
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:50,360
Can I leave this with you?

34
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:52,880
Of course!

35
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,720
Thanks

36
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:56,320
I really have to go.

37
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:01,720
Bye bye!

38
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:02,560
Bye bye to you too.

39
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,120
These are the designs that we came up with

40
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,160
from the concepts and Ideas of this collection that we informed.

41
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:16,480
Although, we are still learning how to do 3D modeling

42
00:04:16,920 --> 00:04:18,600
so it might not be very good.

43
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:21,760
I hope to hear all the feedbacks from you guys

44
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:27,040
I think it looks beautiful, yet elegant, and unique.

45
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,800
I like the diamond in the middle.

46
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:31,080
Well, your design is…

47
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,080
fine.

48
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,680
I would like to give you a suggestion that the main material of this piece should be diamond.

49
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,600
The detail of the necklace connected to the beautiful diamond in the middle is called…

50
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:46,760
The inside of the necklace

51
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:50,600
should use the diamonds in the shape of princess

52
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:54,800
and at the back it would be better to use the diamonds in the oval shape.

53
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:56,400
I think that those adjustments could make this piece looks even more stunning.

54
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,840
I think it looks pretty nice in this style.

55
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:02,240
I haven’t seen one like this in Soul High jewelry for a while.

56
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,040
I wouldn’t say this this is a bad design

57
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,600
but I think it lacks something.

58
00:05:08,040 --> 00:05:11,400
It doesn’t have the identity of Soul jewelry.

59
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,280
If we send this one in, it might not get approved.

60
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:18,120
Since we are only allowed to send in 3 pieces from our department.

61
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:19,840
It might be too risky.

62
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:21,640
That’s right.

63
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:22,880
That might not be true?

64
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:28,160
Since at the moment Soul jewelry is doing the rebranding.

65
00:05:31,480 --> 00:05:35,520
Then I think I will send in yours,

66
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,000
juladis’s design, and Salin’s design.

67
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:48,240
Thank you so much, Kaewmanee.

68
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,040
Salin, don’t forget to send the file to me then.

69
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,440
Alright, I will.

70
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:54,080
You can send it to me directly.

71
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,920
I will give it to them myself because I have to go to the main building anyway.

72
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:01,440
Okay, should I just give you this flash drive then?

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,400
Okay.

74
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:06,760
Here you go.

75
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:08,960
Thank you.

76
00:06:12,120 --> 00:06:12,760
Ah!

77
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:14,760
One more thing,

78
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,320
tonight the president will throw a party

79
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,160
for our department.

80
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:28,040
So, I’ll allow all of you to leave work early today.

81
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:29,520
Go home and get ready.

82
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:32,920
Thank you/Thank you so much

83
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:34,720
Tonight, I will eat until my belly bursts!

84
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:35,680
Thanks.

85
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:41,680
Pim! Are you done? I’m getting hungry now.

86
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:43,760
Yo!

87
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:45,840
Here you go! The new clothes.

88
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,920
Can you turn around for the kid?

89
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,159
It looks good.

90
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:58,440
Isn’t it? I think he will shine the most at the party tonight.

91
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:02,080
I still think it doesn’t look complete.

92
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,360
For real? You’ve been making him try on like ten clothes now.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:10,560
I have to because the president is trying to show off his love for Lin by throwing a party for our whole department.

94
00:07:11,320 --> 00:07:12,680
Have they texted you the location yet?

95
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:21,360
Too plain!

96
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:23,160
Hey!

97
00:07:25,480 --> 00:07:26,400
This one looks quite nice.

98
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:31,440
Really?

99
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:35,520
Just a dinner with your employees. You have to do this much.

100
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:38,600
I know..

101
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,560
I know that whatever I wear, Lin will like it anyways.

102
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,760
It’s just a fact that I’m handsome.

103
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:49,960
Ever since you came back to Thailand,

104
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,880
it looks like your confidence is going through the roof.

105
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,040
Stop it.

106
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:58,480
How about the restaurant that asked you to look for one? Did you find one?

107
00:07:59,000 --> 00:07:59,720
Of course, I do.

108
00:08:00,280 --> 00:08:02,680
I reserved us dinners at the Chalalai Grand Hotel.

109
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:04,160
And I even already texted Chan the location.

110
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,160
Chalalai Grand..

111
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,000
It sounds very familiar.

112
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:11,080
Didn’t our mother know the owner? Right?

113
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,320
Yes, luckily that our mother knows Mr.Sattaban.

114
00:08:14,640 --> 00:08:15,920
The owner of Chalalai Grand,

115
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:18,480
or else I don’t really know where to dine.

116
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:19,800
Come here!

117
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,320
I know that you’re in love

118
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:25,720
but you don’t have to be this crazy in love.

119
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:28,120
Crazy in love?

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,240
I do all of this for all the employees.

121
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:35,360
Very believable!

122
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:38,159
How about you?

123
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,280
Always keep an eye on me.

124
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:42,880
When are you going to become one of the executive members to help me?

125
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,440
Our Mom been asking about you to the point that

126
00:08:45,960 --> 00:08:48,160
I’m afraid that she might fly to the state to find you and your secret will be out.

127
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,960
Come on,

128
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:50,440
give me some time.

129
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:53,320
Also I think you’re doing pretty good yourself.

130
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:57,240
You just took the position but you made some adjustments already.

131
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,440
I heard many people really like your idea.

132
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,400
I have to.

133
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,760
If you want them to work well,

134
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,600
I have to make them happy while working.

135
00:09:08,600 --> 00:09:11,240
Happy people come with good work.

136
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,000
When they made good work,

137
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,080
our sales may increase.

138
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:16,240
Am I right?

139
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,520
What a bright idea you have.

140
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:21,000
In that case,

141
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
I don’t think you will need me.

142
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:23,960
Just you is enough.

143
00:09:23,960 --> 00:09:25,160
Stop that now.

144
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:25,840
Why?

145
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,560
No matter how long you’re trying to avoid this.

146
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:28,200
It won’t make any differences.

147
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,280
You know that when our mom wants something she will get one eventually.

148
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,560
She keeps on complaining about you to me to the point that I don’t know what to do now.

149
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:33,760
I’m making excuses that you’re still working in the state.

150
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:34,440
She kept insisting on..

151
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:35,120
Bro, bro!

152
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:36,240
Enough of this.

153
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:36,640
I’m the one who has to listen to her.

154
00:09:36,640 --> 00:09:38,080
I got that. I got you now.

155
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,360
I’m leaving now.

156
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:40,840
See you!

157
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,320
This little brother!

158
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,160
Is this one good?

159
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:54,000
Bro!

160
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:57,160
The one that you’re touching is really good.

161
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,120
The one that I’m touching?

162
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:02,240
Which one is it?

163
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,560
I touched all of these.

164
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:06,520
Sam! Which one exactly?

165
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,920
Hey guys, they texted me the location just now?

166
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,600
Where is it then?

167
00:10:23,840 --> 00:10:26,080
Hey! Where is it?

168
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:28,080
So that we can get the car.

169
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:33,840
Chalalai Grand

170
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:35,160
What!?

171
00:10:35,720 --> 00:10:36,760
Chalalai Grand!

172
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:45,760
I don’t think you will run into him.

173
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,600
Yeah, the hotel is this large.

174
00:10:49,960 --> 00:10:50,920
You’ll be fine.

175
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:54,280
Who knows? What if it really happens?

176
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,360
We’re all going to be screwed then.

177
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,320
Is this really just a party?

178
00:11:09,640 --> 00:11:11,680
Don’t you think that the party is too extravagant?

179
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:13,520
Agreed.

180
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:17,480
Oh my god!

181
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:20,400
My dress…

182
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,440
I’m underdressed.

183
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:25,520
Pim!

184
00:11:25,800 --> 00:11:26,600
Take a look at your friend.

185
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:29,120
Yeah, look at me.

186
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:30,880
Doesn’t it look like I’m going to the zoo?

187
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:36,840
Guys!

188
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,560
What are you waiting for?

189
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:40,480
The party this big

190
00:11:41,080 --> 00:11:42,440
and P’Jul is expecting us inside.

191
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:43,520
Let’s go.

192
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:44,720
Hurry!

193
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:46,400
Come on, fast.

194
00:11:46,400 --> 00:11:47,160
Let just go.

195
00:11:47,680 --> 00:11:48,360
Don’t you worry.

196
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,200
Yeah, don’t worry about it.

197
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:49,640
Come!

198
00:11:49,640 --> 00:11:50,080
Come on!

199
00:11:50,080 --> 00:11:51,960
We can really protect you, Lin.

200
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:06,360
Wow! The president is here!

201
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:07,120
Hello,everyone from the designing department of Soul jewelry.

202
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:12,760
I’m so glad that I get to meet all of you here today.

203
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:14,720
As all of you might already know.

204
00:13:15,320 --> 00:13:17,000
The reason why I’m throwing you a party

205
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:24,000
is because all of you are really devoted to us for the whole year.

206
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,680
But this isn’t just a party.

207
00:13:28,280 --> 00:13:29,440
That is not us. Just having a lame party.

208
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:36,320
So I invite a world renowned jewelry designer

209
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:38,880
to give you a little bit of knowledge as well.

210
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:44,600
Let’s not waste anymore time here.

211
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:48,200
But first of all, I would like to thank someone

212
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,800
who let us use this hotel.

213
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,360
Please welcome, Mr. Sattabun, the owner of Chalalai Grand.

214
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:09,760
Thank you.

215
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,480
Thank you to Mr. Sattaburn and Mr.Suriyen.

216
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:32,760
Next, who will share her life journey and perspectives

217
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:37,240
and what polished her so that she became one of the world class designers.

218
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:39,880
Please welcome Miss Carina Corner,

219
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,840
a world renowned jewelry designer.

220
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:03,760
They are so beautiful.

221
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,240
Are you two alright?

222
00:15:38,080 --> 00:15:38,880
We’re totally fine.

223
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,240
I’ll be right back in just a second.

224
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:42,360
You’re going to the rest room?

225
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:45,040
Take care of yourself, alright?

226
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,400
We’re okay! Go ahead!

227
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,040
Lin

228
00:16:15,320 --> 00:16:16,120
How is it?

229
00:16:16,840 --> 00:16:18,080
Do you like the party?

230
00:16:19,320 --> 00:16:20,120
I…

231
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:23,880
Are you okay?

232
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,640
P’Sun…

233
00:16:26,800 --> 00:16:28,800
I have something to tell you.

234
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:33,160
Mr. Sattabun

235
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:35,080
is…

236
00:16:44,280 --> 00:16:47,680
My son and the president of Soul high jewelry

237
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,520
seem so close.

238
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
Dad

239
00:16:52,960 --> 00:16:53,960
Dad?

240
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,680
Or this is the reason

241
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:17,400
that you refused to work on our business.

242
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:21,520
You're overthinking now. I’m just doing what I love.

243
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:23,640
it’s not about P’Sun at all.

244
00:17:24,680 --> 00:17:27,000
When you’re out of my sight, I can’t really trust you.

245
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:30,240
Dad, I’m all grown up now.

246
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,960
I can take care of myself.

247
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:36,840
Er.. Lin is doing his internship with me.

248
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:38,920
I’ll make sure to take a very good care of him

249
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,480
Salin is going to be just fine.

250
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:44,600
I want you to feel at ease.

251
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,480
There is nothing to worry about.

252
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,800
This is a family matter.

253
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,920
Dad..

254
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:06,920
I’m just interning for 3 months. That’s it.

255
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:08,800
Whether it’s going to work out or not,

256
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:11,480
eventually I’m going to have to come back to you.

257
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,320
But…

258
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,880
Can I do what I love doing first?

259
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:18,600
Please?

260
00:18:19,480 --> 00:18:23,240
Please.. You’re like the cutest dad ever.

261
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,360
Please, will you let me?

262
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,240
Umm

263
00:18:27,320 --> 00:18:28,400
What?

264
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:29,640
Umm!

265
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:30,880
Sorry?

266
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:32,040
Fine!

267
00:18:32,040 --> 00:18:33,680
You’re the cutest!

268
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:36,400
Thank you so much.

269
00:18:50,360 --> 00:18:51,160
Hold tight!

270
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:01,560
Are you still drunk?

271
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:03,920
You look so drunk right now.

272
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:05,080
Okay..

273
00:19:06,280 --> 00:19:07,720
I’m better now.

274
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:09,840
I had so much fun today.

275
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:10,280
You are?

276
00:19:11,000 --> 00:19:12,320
Everyone got so wasted.

277
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:15,760
Right? but there were many surprises.

278
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:18,680
I was always curious why I felt like I saw Lin’s last name before.

279
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,320
Turns out, he is also a son of a billionaire.

280
00:19:22,360 --> 00:19:24,400
Did you already know about his family?

281
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,480
Of curse, I did.

282
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:29,440
But Lin didn’t want me to tell anyone.

283
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:31,040
Okay.

284
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:38,920
Lin and the president keep lying to each other.

285
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:41,160
Just like in the series.

286
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:41,920
Yeah.

287
00:19:43,640 --> 00:19:45,560
Personally, I like this better.

288
00:19:46,280 --> 00:19:47,240
What do you like?

289
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:51,840
Being an ordinary.

290
00:19:59,880 --> 00:20:01,040
I can eat anywhere.

291
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:03,840
I can walk anywhere.

292
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,000
No matter how hot it is I can tolerate it.

293
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:17,720
Honestly,

294
00:20:21,560 --> 00:20:22,360
it feels good

295
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:26,400
at least to have you.

296
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,840
Being an ordinary by my side.

297
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,200
Gosh!

298
00:20:42,440 --> 00:20:45,040
I’m too drunk now. Don’t believe anything I just said.

299
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,360
Okay!

300
00:21:10,360 --> 00:21:12,040
We’re arrived at my condo now.

301
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,600
I don’t want to let go of your soft hand just yet.

302
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,440
You're being sweet again.

303
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,280
It’s really soft though.

304
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:26,960
You have go home now.

305
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,720
I don’t want you to drive a car this late at night.

306
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:32,480
Since you’ve been working very hard lately too.

307
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:37,720
Please?

308
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,320
Please, please.

309
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,000
Alright.

310
00:21:45,640 --> 00:21:46,920
I’ll let go of you today

311
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,800
but it’s Saturday tomorrow.

312
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:52,520
Can we go on a date?

313
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:56,360
Please?

314
00:21:57,480 --> 00:21:58,320
Can we?

315
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:02,000
Please, please, please.

316
00:22:03,560 --> 00:22:04,400
Okay!

317
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:10,040
Lin, you’re awake?

318
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,040
How was it last night?

319
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,560
Did you have a good dream?

320
00:23:15,800 --> 00:23:16,600
Yes.

321
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:21,600
Something’s wrong?

322
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:24,800
You can tell me?

323
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:28,760
It’s nothing.

324
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,480
Khun Dad, what are you doing?

325
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:35,120
I’m making some minced pork porridge.

326
00:23:35,640 --> 00:23:36,520
Come here, have a seat.

327
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,160
Sit right here.

328
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:44,920
A bowl of minced pork porridge made by P’Sun.

329
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,920
I really tried my hardest to cook this for you.

330
00:23:52,680 --> 00:23:53,640
It looks so good.

331
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,560
You mean…

332
00:23:59,000 --> 00:23:59,640
the porridege?

333
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:01,280
Yes?

334
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,400
I’m talking about porridge. What else would I be talking about?

335
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,040
Well, I think..

336
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,840
that you might want to eat something else.

337
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:14,640
Khun Dad!

338
00:24:15,320 --> 00:24:16,800
I know what you’re thinking about.

339
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,400
Mission completed! I made you smile.

340
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,160
You’re so cute when you’re smiling.

341
00:24:32,320 --> 00:24:33,480
Watch out! Lin!

342
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,160
You need to blow it first. It’s still hot.

343
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:37,920
You’re right.

344
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:41,640
Here,

345
00:24:42,160 --> 00:24:43,160
let me help you.

346
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:21,760
Khun Dad!

347
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:24,720
You’re doing this by surprise again.

348
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:28,720
Look at how you make your face.

349
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:31,720
Looks just like last night.

350
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,440
If you’re doing this,

351
00:25:36,560 --> 00:25:37,880
how can I resist myself?

352
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:40,520
Stop saying that.

353
00:25:42,160 --> 00:25:42,960
Let's just keep eating.

354
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,040
Yours will get cold.

355
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:48,800
Since today is our day off and

356
00:25:50,600 --> 00:25:52,240
we came all the way to Khao Yai.

357
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:57,840
Should we do something?

358
00:25:59,280 --> 00:26:01,880
Doing something again?

359
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:07,360
Are you still tired?

360
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,560
Really P’sun!

361
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:24,000
I’m not going to ride it. I’m scared.

362
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:31,080
My Nu-Lin,

363
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:33,200
you’re already good at riding.

364
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,640
No need to be scared.

365
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:40,160
Khun Dan! I know what you’re implying!

366
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,840
It’s easier said than done.

367
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,560
Then should I get on the horse with you?

368
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:53,400
I will show you some tricks

369
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:55,440
that may help you to get over this.

370
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:57,280
Okay?

371
00:27:05,800 --> 00:27:06,600
Come on,

372
00:27:07,320 --> 00:27:07,880
can I have your hand?

373
00:27:13,160 --> 00:27:13,560
Let do this.

374
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,080
You need to hold right here

375
00:27:16,520 --> 00:27:17,800
and use your feet to step on this.

376
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:21,400
You’rre doing excellent. Now lift your body up.

377
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:32,560
Very good.

378
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:40,320
From now on, if you get scared.

379
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,840
You can just hold my hand.

380
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,840
Because from now on

381
00:27:57,960 --> 00:27:59,680
I will never let go of your hand.

382
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:43,200
This is the room.

383
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,480
How old of the wine that you like,

384
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:47,280
you can just pick one.

385
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:50,560
Wow!

386
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,680
You collected all of these?

387
00:28:54,680 --> 00:28:57,600
Those antiques are not mine.

388
00:28:58,160 --> 00:28:59,040
Those belong to my mom.

389
00:28:59,360 --> 00:28:59,920
Wow!

390
00:29:00,400 --> 00:29:02,600
I’ve seen her collecting these things since I was little.

391
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,360
They are so beautiful.

392
00:29:09,200 --> 00:29:11,000
I heard that this chest is what she got recently.

393
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,640
Just a moment. Chan’s calling.

394
00:29:27,640 --> 00:29:29,200
It could be an important matter.

395
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,040
Okay.

396
00:29:35,640 --> 00:29:36,440
P’Sun

397
00:29:37,920 --> 00:29:38,440
Yes?

398
00:29:40,520 --> 00:29:41,320
I…

399
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:43,640
It’s nothing.

400
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:45,640
Hurry and come back okay?

401
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,320
Okay.

402
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:49,920
Which bottle would you like? You can just choose okay?

403
00:29:50,840 --> 00:29:51,640
Thanks.

404
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:54,760
What is it Chan?

405
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,080
Salin.

406
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:35,040
Salin!

407
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:37,760
Salin

408
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,840
Can you hear me?

409
00:31:42,520 --> 00:31:44,000
I’m right here.

410
00:31:46,120 --> 00:31:47,400
Come to me Salin.

411
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,080
Follow me.

412
00:31:53,400 --> 00:31:54,200
Salin.

413
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,800
Follow me.

414
00:32:26,040 --> 00:32:27,200
I’m right this way.

415
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:30,560
This way Salin.

416
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,040
Follow me.

417
00:32:54,200 --> 00:32:55,000
Lin!

418
00:32:59,400 --> 00:33:00,200
Lin!

419
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:04,960
Lin!

420
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:18,199
Lin!

421
00:34:20,120 --> 00:34:20,920
Lin.

422
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:45,360
Lin! Lin! Lin!

423
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,040
Lin! Lin! Lin!

424
00:35:15,240 --> 00:35:16,040
P’Sun

425
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:37,160
Lin

426
00:35:38,800 --> 00:35:39,840
Here you go, drink some warm water.

427
00:35:40,520 --> 00:35:41,320
You might get sick.

428
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:43,200
Thanks.

429
00:35:58,200 --> 00:35:59,880
I think it’s time that you tell me.

430
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:03,240
What really happened?

431
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:07,560
Erm…

432
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,680
I had a nightmare last night.

433
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:14,640
In my dream I found someone.

434
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:17,760
In my dream,

435
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:20,960
she was asking for my help.

436
00:36:22,720 --> 00:36:24,040
And then

437
00:36:24,960 --> 00:36:26,800
right after you left.

438
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,160
I saw her.

439
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,640
What?

440
00:36:32,160 --> 00:36:33,560
You saw a person from your dream.

441
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,160
I know it sounds unbelievable

442
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:38,880
but I’m not really lying.

443
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:43,840
I saw that she was wearing Thai silk.

444
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,840
The same exact one that you showed me.

445
00:36:51,640 --> 00:36:52,440
Lin.

446
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:54,840
I’ve been having this nightmare for quite a while now.

447
00:36:55,640 --> 00:36:56,480
I feel like..

448
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:01,720
They’re trying to tell me something.

449
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:04,920
But I don’t know exactly.

450
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,080
Ouch!

451
00:37:18,600 --> 00:37:20,200
I’m always right by your side.

452
00:37:22,640 --> 00:37:23,640
you don’t have to be scared of anything.

453
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:25,760
Thanks.

454
00:37:31,040 --> 00:37:32,120
Your hair is all wet now.

455
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:04,360
P’Sun, you can stop staring at me now.

456
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:08,080
I already told you that I’m all better now.

457
00:38:08,920 --> 00:38:11,160
I know that you’re already getting better

458
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,200
still I can’t help but worry about you.

459
00:38:20,520 --> 00:38:21,600
Are you really able to go to work?

460
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:24,240
Of course, I am

461
00:38:24,840 --> 00:38:27,360
Today is the announcement day of Amaraporn design.

462
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,080
How can I possibly miss that?

463
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,480
We still have some time.

464
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,280
It’s already 07:47 A..M now.

465
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:44,880
I must go now

466
00:38:45,360 --> 00:38:46,560
or else I’ll be late for sure.

467
00:38:50,600 --> 00:38:51,880
You have 10 minutes.

468
00:38:53,320 --> 00:38:55,160
I think you can run to your department building in time.

469
00:38:56,800 --> 00:38:58,040
What would you like to do then?

470
00:39:11,400 --> 00:39:13,960
This is from me to cheer you up.

471
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:17,160
Thank you.

472
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:22,800
I wish that you could cheer me up everyday.

473
00:39:27,840 --> 00:39:30,200
Khun Dad, it’s 07:50 A.M. now.

474
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:32,400
I must really hurry now.

475
00:39:32,960 --> 00:39:34,760
I don’t want to get scolded if I'm late.

476
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:37,200
I leave now, bye bye.

477
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:05,800
These are 3 from each team.

478
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,680
I already randomized it

479
00:40:09,200 --> 00:40:12,520
so no one knows which one belong to which team

480
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,400
and also belong to whom.

481
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:17,360
After we vote today, we will make a final decision.

482
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,480
And pass along the design to the Amaraporn’s.

483
00:40:21,240 --> 00:40:22,240
May I have a look?

484
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:30,760
I think we should get to the voting now.

485
00:40:30,760 --> 00:40:33,400
Since I think it is pretty clear

486
00:40:33,400 --> 00:40:34,480
that there is one that stands out the most among them.

487
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:35,280
Alright.

488
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:36,160
Please do.

489
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:01,040
I would like to thank everyone for today.

490
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:02,920
Kaewmanee,

491
00:41:03,240 --> 00:41:09,200
once we’re done here, can you please email the design to the Amaraporn’s company today.

492
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:10,320
Okay.

493
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:27,720
And the award goes to…

494
00:41:33,920 --> 00:41:35,920
The intern from Team A.

495
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:39,680
What a moment!

496
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:45,080
Who would think that we would be winning since we just started as intern.

497
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:48,800
Can we really eat here? I think P’Jul will scold us.

498
00:41:49,160 --> 00:41:51,400
Should we bring the food to the canteen instead?

499
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:54,760
I don’t really care for him.

500
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:57,800
If he scolds us I will!!

501
00:41:57,800 --> 00:41:59,080
Yeah!

502
00:42:01,480 --> 00:42:03,000
Hey!, hey!, hey!

503
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:07,480
What are you doing here in the meeting room?

504
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:15,840
We’re here to celebrate that we won the competition.

505
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:16,800
Really?

506
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:21,720
It’s just an accomplishment.

507
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:24,520
Why do you have to be so happy about it?

508
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:30,920
Maybe because you guys never get any award like me and P’Rung. Right?

509
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:31,680
You’re right!

510
00:42:33,320 --> 00:42:34,080
I’m sorry.

511
00:42:35,080 --> 00:42:38,080
And why did you guys bring food in here?

512
00:42:38,080 --> 00:42:39,560
What was the rule again?

513
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,440
Food is prohibited in the meeting room.

514
00:42:44,440 --> 00:42:45,480
Say it all together!

515
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,560
Food is prohibited in the meeting room.

516
00:42:49,560 --> 00:42:50,840
Well, you guys know the rule.

517
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:53,160
I will get rid of all these then.

518
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:53,920
Stop!

519
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:56,760
I will take care of them myself.

520
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,720
It’s fine we can bring it to eat at the canteen.

521
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:00,360
That’s right./I said not to!

522
00:43:00,840 --> 00:43:04,960
Didn’t all of you have a lot of work to finish?

523
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:07,960
Go get them done now! All 4 of you!

524
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,440
Is it really time to celebrate?

525
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:13,560
If you all can’t finish half of the work today.

526
00:43:14,080 --> 00:43:16,920
You’ll see! Go and get back to work now.

527
00:43:16,920 --> 00:43:17,680
Go!

528
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:20,960
Hey! Put it down!

529
00:43:22,920 --> 00:43:23,840
Hurry up, Yo!

530
00:43:25,360 --> 00:43:27,040
What a bunch of lazy kids.

531
00:43:27,040 --> 00:43:27,960
Hurry and get out!

532
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,120
There’s even a piece of snack in here.

533
00:43:53,240 --> 00:43:54,400
This is so beautiful.

534
00:43:55,720 --> 00:43:57,080
Bad news, madame.

535
00:43:57,640 --> 00:43:59,760
The design that you’re looking

536
00:43:59,760 --> 00:44:03,000
has already been patented by Jim and Claire two days ago.

537
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:03,720
What?

538
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:04,280
It it.

539
00:44:04,280 --> 00:44:05,040
Are you sure?

540
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:05,640
Yes

541
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,480
I have fact checked it already.

542
00:44:18,840 --> 00:44:23,400
Is the Soul High jewelry that trashy to the point that they copy someone’s work?

543
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:26,640
Call Jim and Claaire!

544
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:27,320
Yes, mam.

545
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:28,680
And take care of this mess.

546
00:44:28,680 --> 00:44:29,600
I will, mam.

547
00:44:51,840 --> 00:44:52,920
It’s done.

548
00:44:53,720 --> 00:44:54,640
Wow!

549
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:57,040
it is so beautiful.

550
00:44:57,480 --> 00:44:59,040
Thank you so much, P’Prim.

551
00:44:59,840 --> 00:45:01,680
I’m just helping you with 3D modeling.

552
00:45:02,320 --> 00:45:04,120
This whole idea and design is still yours.

553
00:45:04,680 --> 00:45:06,480
If you’re okay with it I’m going to start rendering now.

554
00:45:11,360 --> 00:45:12,160
I’m okay with it now.

555
00:45:12,360 --> 00:45:13,280
You can start the rendering.

556
00:45:13,280 --> 00:45:14,040
Okay.

557
00:45:14,480 --> 00:45:19,000
Yes! We have accomplished our first hell project.

558
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,880
You’re so good with all these.

559
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:28,360
If it wasn’t for you,

560
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:30,200
we don’t know when we are going to finish this.

561
00:45:30,720 --> 00:45:33,320
You’re not just beautiful but you’re just as good as beautiful.

562
00:45:33,320 --> 00:45:34,280
isn’t that right, Pim?

563
00:45:45,600 --> 00:45:47,720
Hey! I asked you. Why don’t you answer me?

564
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:00,360
Are you really drafting a jewelry design?

565
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:01,720
It looks ridiculous.

566
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:05,600
Yo! I will beat you up!

567
00:46:05,840 --> 00:46:07,520
You will get this rip.

568
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:12,680
Look at the condition of the paper. I think just a little touch can tear it up.

569
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:15,800
But this isn’t your style.

570
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:17,440
Has someone made this for you?

571
00:46:18,560 --> 00:46:19,800
Leave me alone.

572
00:46:19,800 --> 00:46:23,000
Gotcha! Gotcha! Gotcha!

573
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:29,960
Well done.

574
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,080
Thank you.

575
00:46:34,600 --> 00:46:36,080
Salin, where are you going?

576
00:46:36,720 --> 00:46:40,000
I’m on my way to bring my 3D modeling to the production team.

577
00:46:40,960 --> 00:46:42,080
Hand it to me first.

578
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:44,280
Here you go.

579
00:46:45,400 --> 00:46:46,640
P’Kaew, what happened?

580
00:46:48,520 --> 00:46:49,480
You two follow me.

581
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,840
Salin, this is your design right?

582
00:47:09,880 --> 00:47:10,560
Yes?

583
00:47:10,560 --> 00:47:13,160
Madame Amaraporn really likes it.

584
00:47:13,960 --> 00:47:14,680
Really?

585
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:15,960
It’s a shame.

586
00:47:16,520 --> 00:47:18,840
The design got refused by the Amaraporn’s company

587
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:21,440
since it has already been patented.

588
00:47:22,320 --> 00:47:25,520
You have to confess now. Did you copy the design?

589
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,040
You thought that we won’t find out about this.

590
00:47:28,760 --> 00:47:30,000
I didn’t copy this from anyone.

591
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:31,280
It was my idea from the start.

592
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,320
Hey! If it’s really you who did this.

593
00:47:34,760 --> 00:47:36,400
How could this possibly be patented to someone else?

594
00:47:38,640 --> 00:47:40,520
You know what. The fact that you did this

595
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:42,680
not only it causes damage to the company’s reputation

596
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:44,920
but also we will have to pay the fine.

597
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:46,920
How are you going to take responsibility for all of this?

598
00:47:48,320 --> 00:47:49,720
Tell me how!

599
00:47:50,560 --> 00:47:53,360
You have to take care of your intern. How dare they do this?

600
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:55,920
This is completely a copycat.

601
00:47:56,280 --> 00:47:57,920
You should think before doing anything.

602
00:47:58,400 --> 00:47:59,960
Think about the consequences.

603
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:01,720
Do you even have any responsibility?

604
00:48:03,640 --> 00:48:04,840
It’s not just you who is damaged from this.

605
00:48:05,480 --> 00:48:06,960
It’s the company too!

606
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:17,680
President!

607
00:48:18,280 --> 00:48:19,440
There is a situation with Salin now.

608
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:21,200
The design of Salin

609
00:48:21,560 --> 00:48:23,760
got accused of copying Jim and Claire work.

610
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:47,240
Lin

611
00:48:55,640 --> 00:48:57,120
I did’t do this.

612
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:37,920
There is no way that Lin’s going to copy anyone.

613
00:49:38,280 --> 00:49:40,640
I think there’s something behind this mess.

614
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:43,920
At the moment I would like to suspend all orders from the supplier.

615
00:49:44,120 --> 00:49:45,960
Since there will be some changes in our policies.

616
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,160
And I would like to renegotiate everything.

617
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,480
Who is the one that designed this?

618
00:49:48,600 --> 00:49:52,520
Here he is, Salin. The same person who designed the last one.

619
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:53,920
P’Sun

620
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:55,480
Do you want other people to see us?

621
00:49:55,480 --> 00:49:56,640
Look at what you’re wearing.

622
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:57,800
How can I stop myself?

623
00:49:58,800 --> 00:50:00,000
So Khun Dad must really like these things?
