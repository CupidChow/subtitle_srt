1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,880
I’ll give you another chance.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,360
Thank you so much.

3
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:14,640
I have something to discuss with you.

4
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,680
I saw you were talking to my grandpa.

5
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,840
I can’t tell you right now.

6
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:22,600
Although once everything sorts out you’ll find out once you’re back in Bangkok.

7
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,080
We can’t just do nothing about this.

8
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,400
Or do you want to see everything fall apart

9
00:00:27,520 --> 00:00:29,000
by the hands of your very own son?

10
00:00:34,520 --> 00:00:35,320
Salin…

11
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,800
Help me.

12
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Help me please, Salin.

13
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:49,080
I need your help, Salin.

14
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:52,400
Salin,help.

15
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,760
Help me.

16
00:01:13,800 --> 00:01:14,280
Lin.

17
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:16,400
Lin!

18
00:01:19,480 --> 00:01:20,280
Lin, what’s wrong?

19
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:21,920
Look at me.

20
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:26,320
What happened?

21
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:28,840
I have a dream.

22
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:32,360
I saw Sirarin was crying.

23
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,240
It’s fine. I’m right here with you.

24
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:03,520
Lin.

25
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:07,400
Lin.

26
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:08,880
Yes?

27
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:10,120
About last night…

28
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:12,680
try not to pay your mind to it too much, okay?

29
00:03:15,680 --> 00:03:17,160
I won’t.

30
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,920
I just… I just want to figure out a way to help Sirarin.

31
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:27,960
Last night,

32
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,240
I heard her crying.

33
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,880
Although it seemed like I was crying myself.

34
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:47,400
And now, I don’t know if there is a way that I can help her.

35
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,240
If this is too much for you, you don’t have to come to work today, alright?

36
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:54,560
I’m alright.

37
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,040
There are too many things that I have to get done.

38
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,680
Are you really sure about that?

39
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,280
Of course!

40
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:06,320
Let’s take a selfie.

41
00:04:06,440 --> 00:04:06,880
Huh? Why?

42
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:09,840
Come, on.

43
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,000
Here, say cheese.

44
00:04:14,160 --> 00:04:14,640
Hurry?

45
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:16,480
What are you taking the photo for?

46
00:04:17,200 --> 00:04:19,920
Come on, smile!

47
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:22,560
One, two three!

48
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,920
So why do you need our selfie?

49
00:04:31,200 --> 00:04:31,680
Erm…

50
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:35,040
I need it so that I can send it to your grandpa.

51
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:35,760
Huh?

52
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,560
You’ve been talking to my grandpa?

53
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:44,680
Last night he texted me and asked me how are you doing.

54
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:46,560
So I told him that…

55
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:48,760
you have some trouble sleeping

56
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:51,600
and you were worried about work.

57
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:54,680
So I think if we send this picture for him to see,

58
00:04:56,040 --> 00:04:57,400
he might feel a little bit better.

59
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,080
Nowaday, you and my grandpa seem so close. Closer than me.

60
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,040
And also you still won’t tell me what you were talking about.

61
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:18,880
What is this?

62
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:24,720
I also send this to you so that you can watch while you’re working.

63
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:29,440
So that you can always feel like I am always cheering you on.

64
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,480
Look! We’re so cute.

65
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:39,680
Thank you so much.

66
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:08,160
Are you sure that this invoice is legit?

67
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
I sure am. I got this one back when I flew to Qatar.

68
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,080
So I tried ask for them from our supplier as well

69
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,000
and it’s the same as what you’re looking at.

70
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,120
How long have they been doing this?

71
00:06:21,760 --> 00:06:25,280
I think it must have been a while now but not on all the orders.

72
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:27,200
So it’s harder for us to find out about this.

73
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,080
Until we evidently gathered,

74
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,840
don’t tell anyone about this.

75
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:39,960
And I mean our Mom too.

76
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,240
Got that.

77
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:06,960
Alright, I think we shall begin the meeting.

78
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:29,280
Even though you've been out of work for a week it feels like the fire in you is still burning hot.

79
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,000
You’ve been busy checking all the accounts.

80
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,800
“What a mess! Our accounting department has always been so transparents.”

81
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:37,400
“Is he there to mess people around or something?”

82
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:40,720
“Is he somewhere with an intern from the designing department?”

83
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,640
“No wonder, he shifted the budget to the designing department by two or three times more”

84
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,040
"Is there really nothing solid or substantial here?"

85
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:52,240
“What about the new collection that is about to launch?”

86
00:07:54,480 --> 00:07:58,840
“If he continues doing this our company will fall apart”

87
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:04,320
“Mr. Suriyen might have to quit now. I don’t think we need to wait until three months.”

88
00:08:04,320 --> 00:08:05,560
I didn’t say the last sentence!

89
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,680
I just added that myself.

90
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:24,960
I want you all to take a look at the financial document that I prepared.

91
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:30,560
I went to check myself and found out that…

92
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,679
There is a method of fraud that has been carried out subtly and for a long time.

93
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:41,440
Which has caused our company to incur losses and lose a significant amount of money.

94
00:08:43,640 --> 00:08:45,440
Although I still don’t know the person who did this

95
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,400
but I am now able to stop it.

96
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:52,160
About the fact that I went to another province,

97
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:55,960
I will take all the blame since I went there without any notice.

98
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:02,080
But I did that because Khun Songyot likes to talk business in person.

99
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:07,200
And now he promised me that

100
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:10,680
he’ll grant a diamond mining concession in Botswana

101
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:12,520
that he has in collection for us.

102
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:19,560
From now on we will no longer have to worry

103
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,880
about the supply that we’ll use to produce.

104
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,720
To produce quality products is a must

105
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,560
but also by good designing will create a good brand identity.

106
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:35,800
So that we’ll make us unable to replace

107
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,320
and that is the reason why I put more budget into the designing department.

108
00:09:39,880 --> 00:09:42,120
It might seem like there’s nothing solid or substantial just yet.

109
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:44,480
But I want all of you in this room,

110
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:47,360
please keep all of your eyes for our design at the upcoming world jewelry.

111
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:50,800
Take care of that for me, will you? Kaewmanee.

112
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,320
Wait!

113
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:00,600
There's like 2 days left before we have to send our design for the world jewelry event.

114
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,840
You’re right. I have no idea about that at all.

115
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,000
P’Kaewmanee just told us so suddenly.

116
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:13,640
What are we going to do then?

117
00:10:15,000 --> 00:10:17,160
I don’t think we can come up with a new one in time.

118
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,480
How about we just send in our old design.

119
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:28,240
At least we do have something for them.

120
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,440
That’s right.

121
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:31,800
You’ve made such an interesting point.

122
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:33,560
Should we?

123
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:39,600
This is like a world jewelry event, I want to give them something new.

124
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,840
Although I was calculating in my head.

125
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,680
I really don’t think it is possible to make it in time.

126
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:44,480
Yeah.

127
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:47,400
How about this?

128
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,400
We just send in our old design

129
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:53,560
and in those two days if any of us come up with something new.

130
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,360
We could just give them another one maybe?

131
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:01,960
Yeah, I agree with you.

132
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,360
How about you, Lin?

133
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:05,600
Can we please?

134
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:10,640
Alright, let’s go with that.

135
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:12,480
We cute?

136
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:14,160
We can!

137
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:14,840
Ahh.

138
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,120
Let’s stick to our plan.

139
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:20,840
If I’m able to get it done on time. I’ll show you to help me take another look.

140
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:21,680
Is that okay with you guys?

141
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:22,560
Deal!

142
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:23,640
Sounds like we have a plan.

143
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:28,360
Hey! Don’t we have to hurry and find our old design.

144
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:30,960
So that we can ask P’Prim to help us with the 3D model.

145
00:11:31,320 --> 00:11:32,600
Right, or else we might not make it in time.

146
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:33,480
True that!

147
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,640
Let’s go!/What are we waiting for then?

148
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:36,480
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!/Let’s go!

149
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:44,520
Hold on!

150
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,280
Yo!

151
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:05,920
Yo, I like you.

152
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:09,560
I mean I like you too.

153
00:12:11,480 --> 00:12:12,000
A couple?

154
00:12:12,360 --> 00:12:13,120
Really?

155
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:16,280
Are you being serious about this?

156
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:17,400
Uhm..

157
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,040
Honestly, you guys don’t have to drop me off here.

158
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:36,880
That’s not what we do. We’re here to eat your Mom’s chicken and rice.

159
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:39,480
We need to fill up since tonight is going to be a long night.

160
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,080
What do you mean by that?

161
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:44,360
I’m talking about the world jewelry event!

162
00:12:44,840 --> 00:12:46,480
What!? You forgot about that already?

163
00:12:46,520 --> 00:12:47,400
Yeah it completely slipped out of my mind.

164
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:50,880
Alright then. Come in.

165
00:12:58,960 --> 00:12:59,800
Mom!

166
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:04,400
Mom! My friends are here.

167
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,080
I think she might be in a toilet or something.

168
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:13,760
Just wait for her for a second, okay?

169
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:15,880
We’re totally fine.

170
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:16,520
Okay.

171
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,080
Pim?

172
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:23,440
Pim!

173
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:26,600
Yes?

174
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:29,200
What are you watching? I saw that you’ve been binging on something for a while.

175
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:30,040
Ahh…

176
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:34,800
Lately, I’ve been really into series.

177
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,200
At IQIYI has so many heartwarming series,

178
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:41,680
just by watching that makes me so happy.

179
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:44,560
Really? Can I watch it with you?

180
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:46,320
I want to watch as well.

181
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:48,160
See! It’s such a good series.

182
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,200
Wow!

183
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:51,440
I want to watch this one also.

184
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,120
I might have to download the IQIYI application as well since it has so many things to binge.

185
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,440
The app also includes the uncut version which is more spicy.

186
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:12,120
Hello, customers!

187
00:14:13,520 --> 00:14:14,600
What would you like to eat?

188
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,960
Oh! What are you doing here?

189
00:14:26,440 --> 00:14:27,240
Er…

190
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,880
I’m here to help…

191
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,120
the mother of my boyfriend.

192
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:37,960
Ahh, he’s here to help the mother of his boyfriend.

193
00:14:38,200 --> 00:14:40,600
Well then, I will take the rice and chicken.

194
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:41,520
Wait?

195
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:42,680
Chcken and rice!

196
00:14:42,760 --> 00:14:44,440
Yeah! Chicken and rice. Do you want one as well?

197
00:14:44,440 --> 00:14:44,840
Yes, I do.

198
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:45,920
Make it two then.

199
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:46,960
I want mine extra.

200
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:48,400
And for me I want less rice.

201
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:49,920
I’m on a diet. You know?

202
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:51,280
Please get it ready for us.

203
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:51,720
What?

204
00:14:53,160 --> 00:14:54,360
Aren’t you guys shocked or something?

205
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:57,440
What to be shocked about?

206
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:59,440
About the fact that me…

207
00:15:00,280 --> 00:15:01,320
and Sam…

208
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:06,240
Really? Who wouldn’t about you two?

209
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:08,480
I can sense the first time you met at the elevator.

210
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,920
You two were busy looking at each other.

211
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:13,840
It was like there were only you two in the world.

212
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:16,680
Pretended to bicker back and forth!

213
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:19,160
We’ve been friends for a very long time. Of course I can tell right away.

214
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,200
“I miss you so much”

215
00:15:22,120 --> 00:15:24,080
“Can you come to my room?”

216
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,240
“I’ll be there as soon as possible.”

217
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:33,400
Enough of the mockery.

218
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:37,400
Next time, maybe you should learn to turn off your notification. It’s going off all day.

219
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:41,320
Let’s go get my food. We’re so hungry.

220
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:42,160
Yeah, we’re starving.

221
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:43,480
Hurry!

222
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,760
Let’s go inside, my lovely boyfriend.

223
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:46,920
Wow!

224
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,240
What’s wrong with you?

225
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:55,840
Nowadays, Our friend Yo can’t walk on his own.

226
00:15:56,040 --> 00:15:57,240
You’re right.

227
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:00,160
Don’t make mine too sweet.

228
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,120
It’s chicken and rice, not dessert.

229
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:04,200
Okay?

230
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:09,720
Thank you so much Sam for finally taking Yo off of the self.

231
00:16:13,240 --> 00:16:14,160
What happened Yo?

232
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,240
Hurry and slice the chicken for your friends. They’re hungry.

233
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:21,240
Nobody does that anymore.

234
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,319
Khun Dad!

235
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:14,880
What are you working on?

236
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:16,800
Uhm?

237
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:22,200
I’m looking at the draft that I want to use to compete in the world jewelry event.

238
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:23,960
Ahh!

239
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,440
It…looks quite nice.

240
00:17:29,000 --> 00:17:33,280
Really? Why do I feel like something’s off about this?

241
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:36,720
But I don’t really know why.

242
00:17:53,960 --> 00:17:55,040
Khun Dad, what are you trying to do?

243
00:17:57,400 --> 00:17:58,680
I want you to rest a bit.

244
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:03,960
The more that you think about this, the more that you can’t figure this out.

245
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:27,480
Should we do something to relax you?

246
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:30,880
That might help you to come up with something.

247
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:34,640
What is it that could help me to relax?

248
00:18:37,320 --> 00:18:38,440
I’ll show you.

249
00:18:40,800 --> 00:18:41,880
Right now?

250
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:51,000
Wow! You’re so good.

251
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:55,240
Can I try as well?

252
00:18:56,520 --> 00:18:57,880
Of course! Take this.

253
00:18:59,200 --> 00:18:59,840
But…

254
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:02,880
I have no idea how to play pool.

255
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:05,480
I’ll teach you.

256
00:19:06,600 --> 00:19:07,400
That’d be great.

257
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:13,560
Why don’t you try and aim at this one?

258
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:17,640
Tha’s right.

259
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:30,000
Here, let me help you with that.

260
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:31,240
You have to hold it properly.

261
00:19:32,800 --> 00:19:33,600
Okay.

262
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:44,520
Bend down more and then you aim at that.

263
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,280
Just like that.

264
00:19:49,040 --> 00:19:55,040
Khun Dad, I think your snooker stick is touching me.

265
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,240
And you don’t like that?

266
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,160
What’s next?

267
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:11,160
Well, what should we do next?

268
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
You aim at that one, okay?

269
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:17,800
Ready?

270
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:18,560
Yes.

271
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:25,280
If I can hit it, do you have anything for me?

272
00:20:27,080 --> 00:20:27,960
What would you like then?

273
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:30,200
I can give you all of me.

274
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:35,640
I’m going to strike a ball now.

275
00:20:51,680 --> 00:20:52,920
No! I didn’t make it.

276
00:20:54,760 --> 00:20:56,920
Too bad that I won’t get anything from you.

277
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,080
Even though you didn’t make it,

278
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,720
I’ve got something for you anyway.

279
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,200
Really?

280
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,880
What would you be giving me?

281
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:13,000
What do you want?

282
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,480
Anything, it’s up to you.

283
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,600
Oops! I finally struck it down the hole.

284
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:10,160
Didn’t you tell me that you were going to teach me how to play pool?

285
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:13,320
Why are you…

286
00:25:14,040 --> 00:25:15,320
You can’t take this any more?

287
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,600
I just gave you a very big present.

288
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:32,480
I just want you to feel more relaxed.

289
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:42,160
That’s enough now. I won’t get enough sleep then.

290
00:25:46,240 --> 00:25:47,320
I’m just kidding.

291
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:51,040
Have a good dream.

292
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:52,760
Good dream!

293
00:26:38,280 --> 00:26:40,360
This necklace is from me to you.

294
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:43,200
I made it deliberately.

295
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:45,480
My lord, you're hurting me.

296
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:50,520
Ouch, why?  Why do you have to do this to me?

297
00:26:57,880 --> 00:27:01,720
My lord! Lord Phaya!

298
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:02,680
Yes, Mom?

299
00:29:03,960 --> 00:29:05,080
I’m on my way out now.

300
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,400
It shouldn’t take more than an hour.

301
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:11,720
I’m about to leave the company.

302
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:13,880
And…

303
00:29:17,600 --> 00:29:19,360
I’ll take someone important with me.

304
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:23,360
Alright, Mom.

305
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:26,800
See you soon.

306
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,000
Do you have an appointment with your Mom?

307
00:29:32,160 --> 00:29:32,960
That’s right.

308
00:29:34,080 --> 00:29:37,720
Actually… I just want you to come to my home.

309
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:42,560
Is it going to be alright?

310
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,680
Is your Mom going to be okay with that?

311
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:51,840
Not to mention your fiance as well.

312
00:29:53,280 --> 00:29:54,680
You don’t have to worry.

313
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:59,480
One day I’m going to make our relationship public anyway.

314
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:03,640
You’re going to get me in trouble again.

315
00:30:05,720 --> 00:30:06,520
I’m not.

316
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,280
And last night… I saw the design that you drafted.

317
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:22,920
So I felt like…

318
00:30:26,920 --> 00:30:29,200
I really need to show you something at my home.

319
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,000
Let’s hurry then.

320
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,720
Lin.

321
00:30:45,720 --> 00:30:46,520
Yes?

322
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:02,520
This is it. The home that I grew up in.

323
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:04,640
Such a beautiful home.

324
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:07,080
My parents was the one who designed this house

325
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,440
after their success from Soul the company.

326
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:13,120
What a romantic story.

327
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:16,440
Mr. Sun.

328
00:31:16,680 --> 00:31:18,280
Hello, Auntie Nuan.

329
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,600
It’s been such a long time.

330
00:31:21,920 --> 00:31:23,120
How have you been?

331
00:31:23,120 --> 00:31:24,160
I’ve doing good.

332
00:31:24,560 --> 00:31:26,960
How about you? Are you getting better now?

333
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:28,760
I’m getting so much better now.

334
00:31:29,080 --> 00:31:32,880
Thanks to you and your Mom who helped me.

335
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:35,200
Auntie, you don’t have to thank us.

336
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,920
You’re basically a family at this point.

337
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,880
Hello, I’m Salin.

338
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,760
Hello.

339
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:49,560
He’s the one that you’re…

340
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:52,680
Yes, he is the one.

341
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:55,160
Wow! You really have  great eyes.

342
00:31:55,720 --> 00:31:57,400
He looks so perfect.

343
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,240
Thank you so much.

344
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:01,520
He is as cute as you are.

345
00:32:01,520 --> 00:32:03,560
You’re always kind to me.

346
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:08,680
Let’s go eat. I prepared so much food for you.I don’t want it to get cold by now.

347
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,720
Alright.

348
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:16,720
Wow! These look so delicious.

349
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:19,800
Thanks.

350
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:33,560
Oh! These are some of my favorites too.

351
00:32:34,040 --> 00:32:35,080
This is super delicious.

352
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:39,360
You’re all here?

353
00:32:43,560 --> 00:32:44,880
Hello.

354
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,200
Have a seat first.

355
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:51,360
Thanks.

356
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:56,280
How long did you two get here?

357
00:32:56,640 --> 00:32:58,000
We just arrived actually.

358
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:08,800
Mom, this is Salin. The person that I told you about.

359
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:16,840
Hello, Salin.

360
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,520
Let’s have a meal together.

361
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:23,800
Thank you for having me.

362
00:33:26,960 --> 00:33:27,760
Please, enjoy.

363
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:29,880
Okay.

364
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:32,720
Are they looking good?

365
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,480
It’s still looking as appetizing as it used to.

366
00:33:35,920 --> 00:33:38,200
I miss Auntie Nuan’s cooking so much.

367
00:33:39,680 --> 00:33:41,680
You really know how to flatter her.

368
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:48,760
Thanks.

369
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,080
About the work with Amaraporn the last time

370
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:01,960
I really do have to thank you for that.

371
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:06,440
You’re welcome. It’s my pleasure to help the company out.

372
00:34:07,440 --> 00:34:10,360
How long do you have left until you’re done with the internship?

373
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:15,639
I have less than a month. Probably after the word jewelry event.

374
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:17,199
I should be done by then.

375
00:34:18,360 --> 00:34:21,239
Do you have any plans of where you might want to work?

376
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,120
I still haven’t planned anything out.

377
00:34:28,120 --> 00:34:32,800
Sun, what brings you here?

378
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:38,840
I know that you’ve been in Thailand for a very long time but you’ve never stepped a foot back.

379
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:43,440
Now that you’re here today. there must be something.

380
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:49,800
Mom, Can I see the ancient painting of that man?

381
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,440
An ancient painting of a man.

382
00:35:09,080 --> 00:35:12,280
Alright, I’ll show it to you.

383
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,360
Thank you. Should we go now?

384
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,000
Let’s go.

385
00:35:26,440 --> 00:35:28,200
Follow me.

386
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:40,160
This is a painting of a man who helped me in a boat sinking situation 30 years ago.

387
00:35:40,840 --> 00:35:43,440
Back then I was still pregnant with Sun at that time.

388
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:49,640
And what is the reason that you two want to see the painting?

389
00:35:54,560 --> 00:35:55,760
To be completely honest.

390
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,200
I just want Salin to see the painting.

391
00:36:02,280 --> 00:36:05,880
It might give Salin some inspiration in designing a new piece for Soul.

392
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:15,480
It’s a painting that I asked someone to paint for me after I survived the incident.

393
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:20,480
The picture of Lord Phaya Suriyen from my memory.

394
00:36:23,080 --> 00:36:27,560
And after the incident I have never ever met him again.

395
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,520
What have you done Sirsrin?

396
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,760
Why are you so cruel?

397
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,560
How could you even kill your own sister?

398
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:43,120
This necklace is for you.

399
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:51,320
I made it deliberately. I hope that you will like it.

400
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,240
Thank you so much, Sirarin.

401
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:00,240
You’re a really nice sister to me.

402
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:11,600
Let go of me!

403
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:20,040
No! I want to know the reason why you called off our engagement.

404
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,480
I don’t have that kind of feeling for you.

405
00:38:26,040 --> 00:38:28,640
I’m sorry. I do really sorry.

406
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:53,000
You love her. She is the one who holds your heart.

407
00:38:54,280 --> 00:38:56,880
Even though she rejected you heartlessly.

408
00:38:58,040 --> 00:39:02,520
What do I have to do to make you love me?

409
00:39:04,600 --> 00:39:08,240
Can’t I be the one? The one that you love.

410
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:13,160
No matter what you do.

411
00:39:19,120 --> 00:39:22,760
I’m unable to love you, Sirarin.

412
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:38,000
You should go back to where you belong,Sasikarn.

413
00:39:39,440 --> 00:39:40,240
My love..

414
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:49,440
I can’t be engaged with anyone because I love you.

415
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:02,600
Sasikarn?

416
00:40:03,720 --> 00:40:14,120
Sasikarn! Sasikarn!

417
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:39,440
Lord! You’re huring me!

418
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:42,600
What have you done, Sirarin?

419
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:45,800
How can you be this evil?

420
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,200
You’ve killed your own sister.

421
00:40:47,960 --> 00:40:51,760
And this necklace. Take it back!

422
00:40:51,880 --> 00:40:57,240
Because things that belong to you are so pathetic, Sairarin.

423
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:40,400
Madame Wang, can I use your sketching tool and work where for a bit?

424
00:41:45,680 --> 00:41:49,000
Mom, should we talk outside then?

425
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,880
Thank you.

426
00:41:51,880 --> 00:41:53,280
I miss you so much.

427
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,760
After I took in the position

428
00:41:55,800 --> 00:41:58,640
We haven’t got the chance to have a mother-child conversation.

429
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,400
How are you doing then?

430
00:43:21,840 --> 00:43:25,400
You were so against being a president yourself

431
00:43:25,400 --> 00:43:27,680
but now you seem to enjoy it.

432
00:43:29,840 --> 00:43:34,720
Mom, I just want to take something off your shoulder.

433
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,480
Is it not really because of him?

434
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:43,360
What do you want to do about your fiance then?

435
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,960
I don't have any feelings for her and you know it.

436
00:43:48,520 --> 00:43:49,960
Also she doesn’t like me as well.

437
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,360
Not only that but she already has someone.

438
00:43:52,960 --> 00:43:57,880
It’s just a deal that you made between you and other adults without asking your own kid.

439
00:43:59,520 --> 00:44:01,480
And hoe can I know?

440
00:44:01,960 --> 00:44:03,480
I saw that you’ve been single for a very long time.

441
00:44:03,880 --> 00:44:06,280
Aldo you’re in your thirties now.

442
00:44:06,440 --> 00:44:09,560
I’m just worried that no one would want you at this point.

443
00:44:11,120 --> 00:44:14,200
Mom! Don’t forget that you have such a handsome son.

444
00:44:14,840 --> 00:44:16,080
How could you say that?

445
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:18,440
I was just waiting for my destiny.

446
00:44:18,440 --> 00:44:19,600
Destiny.

447
00:44:21,960 --> 00:44:24,720
What do you think about Nu-Lin?

448
00:44:25,400 --> 00:44:26,320
Is he cute?

449
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:30,960
Whoever you chose alway cute to me.

450
00:44:30,960 --> 00:44:31,560
Mom!

451
00:44:32,640 --> 00:44:36,320
You can’t say that. You can’t say whoever.

452
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,120
Because the only one that is cute to me is Lin

453
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:45,200
Oh really? You’re exactly like your Dad.

454
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:50,080
You know you look just like him when he was in love with me.

455
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:58,800
Actually I don’t care who you love but please keep it in the limit.

456
00:44:59,440 --> 00:45:06,360
Don’t let anyone say that the new president is too busy making love.

457
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:12,160
Mom, I’ll be sure that no one can say that. I will do my best as a president.

458
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:14,000
I promise you that.

459
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:15,360
Okay.

460
00:45:16,480 --> 00:45:18,720
i trust you.

461
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:21,200
Lin.

462
00:45:24,080 --> 00:45:25,000
You’re done?

463
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,480
Yes.

464
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:30,960
Can I have a look?

465
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:33,440
Of course, you can.

466
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,400
I think I’ll use this to compete in the world jewelry event.

467
00:45:57,600 --> 00:45:59,280
What do you think about this, Madame Wang?

468
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:01,240
Is it good enough?

469
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:10,680
It is the most powerful design I have ever seen in my life.

470
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:18,720
You did such a great job.

471
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,320
What an honor for me to hear that.

472
00:46:25,840 --> 00:46:26,800
It’s so beautiful.

473
00:46:27,160 --> 00:46:27,880
Right.

474
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:38,800
Wow!

475
00:46:42,960 --> 00:46:43,760
Such a stunning gem.

476
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,280
Very exquisite!

477
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:52,440
Is this what you want?

478
00:46:56,080 --> 00:46:57,040
It’s like the exact one.

479
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:08,440
Then, can I use this gem in your work?

480
00:47:08,720 --> 00:47:09,720
Is that really alright?

481
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:11,680
Of course!

482
00:47:13,280 --> 00:47:18,800
But my design hasn’t been chosen yet.

483
00:47:21,200 --> 00:47:22,240
In the end…

484
00:47:22,880 --> 00:47:26,200
Whether your design will be chosen or not,

485
00:47:29,440 --> 00:47:31,680
I will eventually make this piece from your design anyway.

486
00:47:43,840 --> 00:47:44,520
Why don’t you take a closer look?

487
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:46,440
Can I?

488
00:47:46,960 --> 00:47:48,440
May I then.

489
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:52,960
Wow!

490
00:47:53,640 --> 00:47:54,440
Is this one gorgeous?

491
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:59,720
Very much. It's so indescribable.

492
00:48:06,120 --> 00:48:07,800
My heart is beating so fast when I look at it.

493
00:48:09,000 --> 00:48:13,000
The closer I look, the more beautiful it gets.

494
00:48:15,720 --> 00:48:16,520
It’s like…

495
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:18,000
It’s like you.

496
00:48:22,760 --> 00:48:23,840
You’re flattering me again.

497
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:35,160
So I will use this gem in your design.

498
00:48:36,840 --> 00:48:37,640
I’d love that.

499
00:48:39,360 --> 00:48:41,240
I’ll do my best.

500
00:48:57,800 --> 00:49:02,160
You haven’t won yet but you keep smiling nonstop.

501
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,800
Actually, I don’t really care if I win or not.

502
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,400
I just want to do my best so I don’t care what people say to me.

503
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:13,680
I believe in you.

504
00:49:15,480 --> 00:49:18,000
Thank you, Khun Dad.

505
00:49:41,200 --> 00:49:44,000
Come, let’s celebrate.

506
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:49,040
No, I don’t want to. You know that I don’t really like water.

507
00:49:49,800 --> 00:49:52,800
Whenever I’m in, something bad always happens.

508
00:49:53,080 --> 00:49:54,240
Please, Lin.

509
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,040
Just come with me once.

510
00:50:00,920 --> 00:50:01,720
No, I don’t really want to.

511
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,160
I’ll be by your side.

512
00:50:06,080 --> 00:50:07,120
Or you can just put your legs in the water.

513
00:50:09,800 --> 00:50:10,600
Please?

514
00:50:13,640 --> 00:50:15,560
Come down here please. Please?

515
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:17,440
Fine.

516
00:50:21,960 --> 00:50:22,760
Just only my legs, okay?

517
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:37,280
How is it?

518
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,120
It’s so cool. I really like that.

519
00:50:46,720 --> 00:50:50,320
I told you. There’s nothing for you to be afraid of.

520
00:50:51,440 --> 00:50:52,240
You’re right.

521
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:15,160
Khun Dad!

522
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:35,840
When I’m right here, you don’t have to be scared of anything.

523
00:51:55,560 --> 00:51:56,560
Don’t you trust me?

524
00:51:58,800 --> 00:51:59,800
I trust you, of course.

525
00:55:02,920 --> 00:55:05,200
I haven’t seen you today. Is everything alright?

526
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:07,320
No, I just want to change the scenery.

527
00:55:07,480 --> 00:55:09,040
I know that you’ve been so stressed lately

528
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:10,520
so I just want you to get it all out.

529
00:55:10,520 --> 00:55:13,880
You’re here to my place like this. Do you think I ‘ll let you go that easy?

530
00:55:13,880 --> 00:55:16,400
The design of Salin has already been patented.

531
00:55:17,720 --> 00:55:19,120
Even though that we’re so sure about this

532
00:55:19,120 --> 00:55:20,240
but we don’t have enough evidence.

533
00:55:20,520 --> 00:55:22,400
You have to do everything whatever you have to,

534
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:26,680
just to make that piece of jewelry unable to be displayed at the world jewelry event.
