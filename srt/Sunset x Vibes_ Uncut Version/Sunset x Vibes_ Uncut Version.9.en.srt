1
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,160
Lin!

2
00:00:13,760 --> 00:00:18,240
I felt like I was trapped in my dream.

3
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,960
It felt like it was such a long dream.

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:24,240
He already has a fiance?

5
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:26,600
Her name is Allie.

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,720
I believe she is a close relative of Madame Amaraporn.

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:30,920
Lin!

8
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:33,400
Lin!

9
00:00:44,080 --> 00:00:45,760
Good morning!

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:48,720
Wake up now. Don’t be a sleepyhead.

11
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,920
Uhm.. What is it?

12
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:53,720
Let’s go have breakfast.

13
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:55,400
I’m getting hungry now.

14
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:58,080
Why don’t you go and have your breakfast first? I’m not hungry yet.

15
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:00,680
No, you have to. Mom asked for you.

16
00:01:01,640 --> 00:01:02,240
Hurry!

17
00:01:02,240 --> 00:01:03,240
Not going!

18
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,680
You have to! If you don’t come I won’t have my meal.

19
00:01:10,160 --> 00:01:10,920
Fine.

20
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:11,400
Come on.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,000
Wait, Can I have at least another 10 minutes?

22
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,800
You can’t! Now, get up!

23
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:16,280
Just 5 minutes then?

24
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,520
I said no!

25
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,800
Give me 2 minutes!

26
00:01:19,720 --> 00:01:20,520
Alright!

27
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,120
Okay! Time’s up now!

28
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:26,280
What? Why is it so fast?

29
00:01:26,280 --> 00:01:29,600
I’m getting real hungry now./You tricked me!

30
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,000
I’m coming.

31
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,600
It’s too early.

32
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:43,680
Wow!

33
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,640
It smells so good.

34
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:49,960
You’re finally up, Lin.

35
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:52,520
I am./I miss you so much.

36
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:55,160
Can you help me set the table up?/Of course.

37
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,560
I’m going to help her as well.

38
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,760
That’d be great.

39
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,560
What nice kids I have.

40
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:11,240
Grandpa, good morning!/Morning!

41
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,240
It’s been quite a while. Do you miss me?

42
00:03:16,240 --> 00:03:17,920
Of course! I do.

43
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:21,960
Let’s have breakfast together.

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:23,480
Grandpa, have a seat here.

45
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:31,560
Did you know Tara won’t wake up? I had to wake her up this morning.

46
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:32,440
What? You’re lying!

47
00:03:32,440 --> 00:03:36,079
You should’ve let her sleep comfortably then.

48
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:37,800
Grandpa is always right!

49
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,800
A bowl of hot porridge for you.

50
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:46,760
It looks so delicious!

51
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:48,040
What a peeved!

52
00:03:48,440 --> 00:03:49,800
Thanks.

53
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:51,600
I almost had to drag you home but you refused.

54
00:03:52,280 --> 00:03:54,079
But now you sneaked your way home yourself.

55
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:55,120
Is that okay?

56
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,480
And you’re still quite sick.

57
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:02,720
Honey, we should be happy that he’s home now.

58
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,880
Look at him! Everything is still intact.

59
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,080
Ah.. Do I have to wait for him to miss a limb or something?

60
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:15,440
I get it now. Is it because that young man hurt you?

61
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,720
That’s why we are now matters.

62
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:19,920
Dad!

63
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:23,680
And another../Fine! Stop!

64
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,160
Stop scolding him! You should be happy now that he’s back.

65
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:30,120
What else do you want from him? Enough now.

66
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:33,920
We should just eat. The food will get cold by now.

67
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:37,560
This is for you. It’s freshly made and all of them are your favorite.

68
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:42,159
I will stir that for you. /I remember that you like this one.

69
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:43,440
Thank you.

70
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:45,120
Stir-fried preserved radish with eggs.

71
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:48,960
And this one is your fav.

72
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:51,320
See! He knows me so well.

73
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:53,159
What a great grandkid.

74
00:04:53,159 --> 00:04:54,040
How about your dad?

75
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:55,640
This one is for Mommy.

76
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,000
Salted egg?/Your Dad too?

77
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,080
Thanks.

78
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:02,880
This one is for my troublemaker.

79
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,800
Is it me? Am I your troublemaker?/He’s talking about his sister.

80
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,120
What about me?

81
00:05:08,120 --> 00:05:09,440
You can get one yourself.

82
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:10,440
Really?

83
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:16,520
Here, since no one does that for you.

84
00:05:40,760 --> 00:05:41,440
Lin, are you alright?

85
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,120
If not, you can talk to me about anything.

86
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:49,560
It’s nothing. I’m fine.

87
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:54,600
That’s a pretended smile. I can see right away.

88
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,760
I know you. You won’t come home this easily.

89
00:05:57,760 --> 00:05:59,600
Unless, you might have some problems.

90
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:01,200
Hmm?

91
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:03,600
Is it about love?

92
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:08,240
A son of Madame Wang right?

93
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:13,520
You’re right.

94
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,040
But things will get better.

95
00:06:20,760 --> 00:06:21,880
It was just like a dream to me.

96
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:24,160
I realized that it was just my nightmare

97
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:28,080
and I know that it will disappear when I’m no longer dreaming.

98
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:35,440
It really happened to you. It wasn’t just a dream.

99
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:38,320
Can you tell me what happened?

100
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:50,440
I love him.

101
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,200
He was so nice to me

102
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:58,240
but…

103
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:06,840
I just realized that he’s been engaging for a while now.

104
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:18,440
Do they love each other? Is it all in your mind?

105
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:20,080
I have no idea about that.

106
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,960
But they look perfect for each other.

107
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:33,240
Mommy.

108
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:40,120
They may look like a perfect match to you but it may noy be what you think.

109
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:43,760
Love is between 2 people.

110
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:50,080
In the end, if the person that he loves is you

111
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,880
that is the real definition of perfect for each other.

112
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:57,000
Whatever choice you made I will always support that.

113
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:32,559
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

114
00:08:32,799 --> 00:08:33,679
Od course, I do.

115
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,799
Can I ask you to do whatever your heart desires?

116
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:39,000
About our relationship..

117
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:42,679
We can discuss later about when are we going to make it public.

118
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:50,520
I want us to have cute nicknames just for the two of us.

119
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:51,800
What should we call each other?

120
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,280
Khun Dad?

121
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:54,400
I like that.

122
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,600
I would like to keep you just for me.

123
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:22,720
From now on, if you ever felt frighten,

124
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,120
you can alway hold my hand tightly.

125
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:06,720
Mommy, can we go now? Dad is waiting.

126
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,280
Where is your brother?

127
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,080
He’s coming.

128
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,000
Lin.

129
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Whose car is that?

130
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:49,720
Good morning, Mother.

131
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:50,480
Good morning.

132
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:52,600
Lin!

133
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:56,960
Lin.

134
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
Can you talk with me first?

135
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:05,240
You drove this far.

136
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,400
How did you know that I’m here?

137
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,720
Why didn’t you tell me that you were coming home?

138
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,480
I called you many times but you’ve never answered any of my calls.

139
00:11:15,480 --> 00:11:16,600
Also the text. Why did you never reply back?

140
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:18,800
What’s wrong? Can you tell me?

141
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,440
I want to be left alone.

142
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,200
If you want that you could’ve told me that.

143
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:34,440
You didn’t have to run away from me.

144
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:35,720
P’Sun, Can you just go back?

145
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:42,160
No!

146
00:11:43,080 --> 00:11:45,640
If you’re not coming with me then I’m not going back.

147
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:49,600
When I finally can get over this, I will go back there myself.

148
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:52,120
Get over this?

149
00:11:52,120 --> 00:11:53,160
You don’t have to worry.

150
00:11:54,920 --> 00:11:56,360
As for work I won’t leave anything unfinish.

151
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,640
Get over about what?

152
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,440
About the fact that you have a fiance.

153
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:06,480
Ahh…

154
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,280
I think there must be a misunderstanding.

155
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:19,920
What is it?

156
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:25,000
To me you two look like you were meant to be.

157
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:29,160
If you mean the picture that you probably saw,

158
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,960
it’s not what you think it is.

159
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:41,040
That day Allie helped us.

160
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
So I just did what I promised to her.

161
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,320
Can we take a selfie together?

162
00:13:02,840 --> 00:13:06,320
Excuse-me, the guests are all here.

163
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:09,040
Ms. Allie and Mr. Sun, please come this way.

164
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,320
You just have to make it look realistic enough.

165
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:19,560
And after this, let's call it even.

166
00:13:25,560 --> 00:13:27,520
Allie already has a woman that she loves.

167
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,760
So she doesn't want anyone to flirt with her.

168
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,840
She just asked me to act as her boyfriend.

169
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,680
You have to trust me.

170
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,800
If not I will let you look over my texts.

171
00:13:41,800 --> 00:13:44,240
Lin, Dad asked you to go get the coconuts together.

172
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:46,840
Let’s go!

173
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:50,040
Lin!

174
00:13:50,680 --> 00:13:51,080
Lin!

175
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,400
Do you want to come with us?

176
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,480
Am I allowed to?

177
00:13:56,480 --> 00:13:57,720
Of course, you are. Let’s go.

178
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,040
Mother/Yes?

179
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,920
Thanks for calling me.

180
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:05,240
No problem at all. Let’s go.

181
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:06,200
Okay!

182
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:10,920
I am not as good as I used to be.

183
00:14:12,840 --> 00:14:13,920
Dad, we’re here.

184
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,680
You are! Look, I knew that all of you would be here so I prepared all these coconuts for you.

185
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:21,240
Here, there are so many of them.

186
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:23,680
I think I’ll get you a new one.

187
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,040
Which one should I cut for them, Dad?

188
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,320
That one looks nice.

189
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:28,960
This one also looks beautiful.

190
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,160
Let me help you with those.

191
00:14:35,280 --> 00:14:36,080
What are you doing here?

192
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:37,600
Go away!

193
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:38,800
Get out now!

194
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,160
Honey, be careful! That knife is too sharp. /Don’t help him!

195
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,560
Dad, can you help talk to him?

196
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,320
Stop! Stop! You need to stop all that.

197
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:49,040
You need to give him at least a chance.

198
00:14:49,480 --> 00:14:52,120
The more people we have the better.

199
00:14:52,760 --> 00:14:54,360
Are you sure that you can do this?

200
00:14:54,640 --> 00:14:55,600
Thank you so much, Grandpa.

201
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:56,720
Move back!

202
00:14:56,720 --> 00:14:57,400
Dad!

203
00:14:57,960 --> 00:14:59,160
Listen to me!

204
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:01,600
Move away!

205
00:15:03,560 --> 00:15:05,920
You have to learn to give other people a chance.

206
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,240
Hey you! Are you sure that you know how to do this?

207
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:08,920
Yes!

208
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,760
Show me what you got.

209
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:20,440
Be caureful. It’s sharp, you will need to focus.

210
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,000
Go on, try to do it.

211
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:31,800
Would you look at that? He has no idea how to do that.

212
00:15:34,440 --> 00:15:35,480
Please, don’t cut yourself.

213
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,360
Come on, focus!

214
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:43,320
Yeah, that’s alright. It’s your first.

215
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:45,520
Everybody needs to practice./What!?

216
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,320
Everybody has to go through the stage of practicing.

217
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:49,960
Don’t give up just yet.

218
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,280
Keep going!

219
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:57,560
Are you really going to be alright?

220
00:15:58,000 --> 00:15:58,960
Grandpa…

221
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,560
Huh?

222
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:00,960
It doesn’t look like we will get to drink anything today.

223
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:11,360
You can go home after you’re done with this glass.

224
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,520
Would you stay here until sunrise or something?

225
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,200
Look at the mess you made!

226
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:23,040
It’s getting too late now. I don’t think it’ll be safe to drive at this hour.

227
00:16:24,360 --> 00:16:26,520
If you don’t mind all the sound and the surrounding of nature,

228
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:27,960
you can stay here for the night.

229
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:29,920
Honey!

230
00:16:30,280 --> 00:16:33,240
That’s right! Actually, I don’t mind him sleeping with me.

231
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:34,080
What?!

232
00:16:35,320 --> 00:16:38,160
I mean he can sleep in my room

233
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,400
and I’ll go sleep in my sister's room.

234
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:41,560
Ah..

235
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,360
Wait! No!

236
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:48,800
I won’t let a random man sleep in your room.

237
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:50,960
So, where would you let him sleep?

238
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:53,640
If he really wants to stay here.

239
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,080
We have a couch for that.

240
00:16:57,840 --> 00:16:59,640
You got that. I’ll be fine on the couch.

241
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:01,080
You will probably hurt your back.

242
00:17:01,080 --> 00:17:02,000
It’s okay with me.

243
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:03,000
There are mosquitoes.

244
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:05,000
I’m like a mosquito killer.

245
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:07,720
What a stubborn kid!

246
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,280
I’ll see if he will even last until the morning./Thanks a lot.

247
00:17:11,599 --> 00:17:12,560
Don’t thank me!

248
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,440
Why are you so mean? There are a lot of mosquitoes here.

249
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:17,200
Just let him be!

250
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:26,040
Hmm!

251
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:28,000
What are you two doing?

252
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,640
We’re doing nothing.

253
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,920
Go to sleep! It’s getting late now!

254
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:35,480
But I’m not sleepy yet.

255
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:37,440
I don’t care! Just go to sleep.

256
00:18:58,240 --> 00:18:58,960
P’Sun!

257
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:01,440
I don’t want my Dad to see this.

258
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:04,360
I miss you.

259
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:07,760
It’s been a very tough 4 days without you.

260
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:12,840
I’ve been so lonely because I had to sleep alone.

261
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:14,800
I’ve been so empty without you.

262
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:17,480
Can you please not be upset with me anymore?

263
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:19,320
Please? Please? Please?

264
00:19:22,600 --> 00:19:23,480
P’Sun!

265
00:19:23,480 --> 00:19:25,320
Yes? Can you not be angry with me any more?

266
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:26,640
So that we can go back and sleep together.

267
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:31,320
Should I stop being upset at you? or should i not?

268
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,760
Lin, can you please forgive me?

269
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,400
Please?? Can you please??

270
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,920
Then..

271
00:19:41,400 --> 00:19:44,280
I’m making a promise with you that I will tell you everything.

272
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:45,680
Is that alright?

273
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:46,680
Please?

274
00:19:46,680 --> 00:19:47,320
Pinky promise? Please???

275
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,880
Fine, let’s make a promise.

276
00:19:49,600 --> 00:19:50,760
And I’ll also forgive you.

277
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,000
Well then,

278
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:53,600
I’m going to start with this.

279
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:02,480
Uhm.. I peeked at you when you were showering during our first date.

280
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:13,560
And that made something in me wake up just like right now.

281
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:18,480
P’Sun! You don’t need to tell you everything in detail like that.

282
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:21,000
I just want to know the important ones.

283
00:20:21,000 --> 00:20:22,440
I want you to know about all this.

284
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,040
You should go back to sleep now.

285
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,720
I also have to get back to my room.

286
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:30,880
My Dad kept on tracking my room every 2 hours.

287
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,280
It’s been almost 2 hours now.

288
00:20:35,920 --> 00:20:37,600
Then I must hurry now.

289
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:40,200
Cover yourself with a blanket okay?

290
00:20:40,720 --> 00:20:41,160
Lin!

291
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:43,440
Yes?

292
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,440
One more thing.

293
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:46,280
What is it?

294
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,880
Good night.

295
00:20:51,840 --> 00:20:52,760
P’Sun!

296
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,400
Always sneaking up and kissing me like that.

297
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Good night to you too.

298
00:20:58,480 --> 00:20:59,160
Good night.

299
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:00,600
Go on, cover your self!

300
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,240
I’ll go back to my room now.

301
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,280
Ouch! I hurt my back so badly.

302
00:21:08,280 --> 00:21:10,000
It would be better if I get to sleep on Lin’s bed.

303
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:15,000
Don't complain! You have to handle this.

304
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:16,200
See you to morrow.

305
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:17,760
Good bye!

306
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:18,760
Bye bye!

307
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,720
I think my Dad is coming.

308
00:21:32,680 --> 00:21:34,440
Morning! P’Sun.

309
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:55,280
Looks like he can’t handle sleeping on the couch.

310
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,080
He must have already gone back by now.

311
00:21:59,120 --> 00:22:01,320
I told you already. Didn’t I?

312
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:03,200
That a person like him doesn't really love you.

313
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:09,040
He couldn't handle just a little inconvenience.

314
00:22:09,880 --> 00:22:12,400
That’s fine. At least we have each other.

315
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:13,760
Right?

316
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:17,240
Would you look at that?

317
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:20,480
There is plenty of food on the table. Let’s have breakfast together.

318
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:23,760
Come on, come.

319
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,440
I think your Mommy is excited to have you here with her.

320
00:22:30,080 --> 00:22:33,040
She made so much food.  All of them are looking so good.

321
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,720
Good morning to you Dad.

322
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:39,680
I prepared all of your favorite meals for you.

323
00:22:44,080 --> 00:22:46,080
You’re still here?

324
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,800
What is that smell? It smells so good.

325
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,440
What do we have this morning?

326
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,320
Don’t ask me. Nothing smells good here!

327
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:57,200
Here! we have curry and

328
00:22:57,600 --> 00:22:58,720
acacia omelet.

329
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:01,440
And this one, Dad’s favorite.

330
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:04,200
Garlic pepper fried frogs.

331
00:23:04,360 --> 00:23:05,400
Don’t act like Mr.Knows it all.

332
00:23:05,400 --> 00:23:07,640
I really did my best for you on this one.

333
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,240
Wow! It is so delicious.

334
00:23:13,240 --> 00:23:14,440
Those look so appetizing.

335
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,520
And did you make all of them yourself?

336
00:23:17,880 --> 00:23:22,560
No, I just helped your Mother here and there.

337
00:23:27,400 --> 00:23:29,480
I figured! A person like him must’ve not known how to do all these.

338
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:31,120
Wow! Look at the coconuts.

339
00:23:38,000 --> 00:23:39,240
It is so refreshing!

340
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,280
But the coconut water that you’re drinking now

341
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:43,840
it’s all done by Sun himself.

342
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:52,880
This one is so flavorless!

343
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:00,160
I think you did very well. Yesterday you still had no clue how to peel a coconut.

344
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:05,280
How to peel a coconut like a pro?

345
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:18,000
Wow!

346
00:24:19,360 --> 00:24:20,640
I’m quite a fast learner myself.

347
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:24,320
Thank you.

348
00:24:26,360 --> 00:24:28,560
You may have a seat here. I’ll get the chair for you.

349
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:30,640
Thank you so much.

350
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:32,800
Thanks again.

351
00:24:33,720 --> 00:24:35,400
All of them look so good.

352
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,680
I’ll get the chair for you too, Dad.

353
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:38,320
No need to!

354
00:24:40,360 --> 00:24:41,640
I can do that myself!

355
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:54,360
Thanks.

356
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:15,160
I miss Lin so much. I want to know how he's holding up now.

357
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,120
I think the person that you should be worrying about is P’Sun.

358
00:25:23,360 --> 00:25:25,360
It’s like Lin is introducing a soon to be son in law to a future father in law.

359
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:34,360
Pim.

360
00:25:37,440 --> 00:25:38,240
P’Prim?

361
00:25:40,680 --> 00:25:41,960
Is your leg okay now?

362
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:44,160
Yes, I’m fine now.

363
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,320
Are you free this evening?

364
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,280
I am.

365
00:25:56,280 --> 00:25:57,320
Is there anything that I can help you with?

366
00:25:57,760 --> 00:25:58,960
Once you’re done with the work, don’t go home just yet.

367
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,800
Well, if you still want me to teach you. See you this evening!

368
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:15,920
Yo!

369
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:17,680
Yo!, Yo!

370
00:26:17,720 --> 00:26:19,200
Yes! I’ve seen all of that!

371
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,400
Am I dreaming?

372
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,840
You’re not dreaming now.

373
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,160
Wow! Oh my god!

374
00:26:24,160 --> 00:26:28,360
Your idol has now accepted you as her student.

375
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,120
What an amazing day!

376
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,600
It’s like I’m seeing the world through rose-colored glasses.

377
00:26:38,800 --> 00:26:43,480
Good for me. It makes me happy just to see her face everyday.

378
00:26:47,280 --> 00:26:47,840
I’m all blushing now.

379
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,080
P’Prim…

380
00:26:54,600 --> 00:27:02,080
I want to see her. I want to talk to her. I can’t get her out of my mind.

381
00:27:12,920 --> 00:27:15,880
Mom! Why are you closing so quickly today?

382
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:20,080
Well, because your friend has been here to help me for a while now.

383
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:22,600
My friend?

384
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,200
Yes.

385
00:27:27,240 --> 00:27:29,240
See! Here he is.

386
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:31,600
Don’t forget to close the gate for me?

387
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:32,720
I have to put these away now.

388
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,120
What would you like me to help you with, sir?

389
00:27:46,120 --> 00:27:48,240
Sir? Can you act normal now?

390
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:49,160
You…

391
00:27:49,360 --> 00:27:50,040
I mean

392
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:55,600
You’re no longer Sam, an intern that I know, sir.

393
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,200
I’m still your Sam like I was.

394
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:00,920
And why do you have to pretend to be an intern

395
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:01,960
and lied to all of us?

396
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:02,760
I just don’t really get that.

397
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:04,600
Yo, I have my reasons.

398
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:05,760
I can explain all of that to you.

399
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:11,000
Yo, it's a really important matter that I have to tell you now.

400
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,280
Yo! I like you.

401
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,640
And if you don’t feel the same,

402
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,120
I’ll let you be without me.

403
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:39,320
And the reason why I told you that is because I don’t want to waste anymore time.

404
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,520
I want to be with you now.

405
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,240
So, what do you say?

406
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:54,000
I…

407
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:04,440
Fine, I’ll leave you alone then.

408
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:08,440
I also really like you.

409
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,760
But I felt like we’re too different.

410
00:29:29,360 --> 00:29:30,160
Yo!

411
00:29:31,640 --> 00:29:34,680
You need to listen. I can eat with you anywhere.

412
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:35,600
I don’t mind at all.

413
00:29:36,400 --> 00:29:37,880
I’m fine taking a bus with you.

414
00:29:38,280 --> 00:29:40,720
I can even be an intern like you at our workplace.

415
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,240
I’m ready to adjust. All I ask from you is a chance.

416
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:46,120
A chance to do all of those things with you.

417
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:55,920
Fine, just what you said.

418
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,440
Just what I said? What do you mean by that?

419
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:00,080
Well..

420
00:30:01,920 --> 00:30:02,640
Boyfriend!

421
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:03,880
Boyfriend?

422
00:30:04,560 --> 00:30:05,400
Seriously?

423
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,320
Are you being serious?

424
00:30:08,680 --> 00:30:09,760
Ouch!

425
00:30:11,480 --> 00:30:12,480
Of course, I am.

426
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:16,240
In that case, can I ask you for one thing?

427
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:20,920
Can I ask you for a kiss?

428
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,280
What is wrong with you?

429
00:30:23,280 --> 00:30:25,600
Please, be a little more kind to me.

430
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:26,600
Please?

431
00:30:27,600 --> 00:30:28,440
Sam!

432
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:29,240
Hurry!

433
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:30,600
My mom will see this.

434
00:30:30,600 --> 00:30:31,360
Make it fast then.

435
00:30:38,800 --> 00:30:39,560
Satisfied now?

436
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,760
Can I have another kiss?

437
00:30:42,400 --> 00:30:44,120
My mother is calling me now. I have to go.

438
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,000
Dad!/Go!

439
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:55,280
Go sort thing out!

440
00:30:55,280 --> 00:30:57,240
You were also like this!

441
00:30:57,360 --> 00:30:58,160
But Dad!

442
00:30:58,400 --> 00:31:00,200
No! Go!

443
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,600
This is my last straw now.

444
00:31:02,600 --> 00:31:03,160
Dad!

445
00:31:04,080 --> 00:31:04,880
Do what I said!

446
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:14,560
Is there anything that you want to talk to me about?

447
00:31:17,800 --> 00:31:19,760
I… I will give you another chance.

448
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:22,240
Speak louder!

449
00:31:27,040 --> 00:31:28,720
I will give you at least a chance.

450
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:33,160
Thank you so much, Dad.

451
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,840
I’ll behave the best.

452
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:42,120
What are you doing? Who are you to hug me?

453
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:50,600
Always remember to keep your words.

454
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:54,000
If you can’t do that! You will see the worst of me!

455
00:31:55,240 --> 00:31:57,760
Yes! I’ll take care of Lin as best as I possibly can.

456
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,400
If it’s not because of him!

457
00:32:07,160 --> 00:32:08,040
There’s no way I’m giving you any chance.

458
00:32:10,840 --> 00:32:11,560
Come here,

459
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,120
I need to talk with you.

460
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,040
Come here.

461
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,000
Yes?

462
00:32:16,840 --> 00:32:17,640
Excuse me then.

463
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:23,720
Wait! I’ll be sure to keep both of my eyes on you.

464
00:32:44,520 --> 00:32:46,000
It looks like you’re getting the hang of it now.

465
00:32:49,520 --> 00:32:50,440
P’Prim

466
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:03,560
From this angle, you have to do this.

467
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,760
And right here you need to bend to the left more.

468
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,640
The light would reflect better on this side.

469
00:33:10,760 --> 00:33:13,280
And this right here, it’s easier to use this tool.

470
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:19,520
Is this really you teaching me?

471
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,120
I’m just giving you some advice

472
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,040
or do you not want that?

473
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:28,120
Of course, I do.

474
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:29,960
I do want you.

475
00:33:35,240 --> 00:33:37,560
Do you want me to be your mentor this much?

476
00:33:39,200 --> 00:33:40,240
Can I ask why?

477
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:48,880
I love your design and also your  concept of ideas.

478
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:50,200
Uhm…

479
00:33:52,280 --> 00:33:53,240
About that day…

480
00:33:54,160 --> 00:33:57,440
I’m so sorry. It’s my fault.

481
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:02,160
That's why all of your designs have all ruined.

482
00:34:03,160 --> 00:34:04,600
You mustn't be able to turn in your work on time.

483
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:12,239
You mean this one?

484
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:15,159
I already turned it in.

485
00:34:15,159 --> 00:34:15,760
What?!

486
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,679
You did?

487
00:34:20,080 --> 00:34:23,600
How is that even possible? You said that you were unable to save it in time.

488
00:34:23,960 --> 00:34:25,679
Well’ it was autosaved in the cloud.

489
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:28,000
Didn’t you say that you were a new kid with high tech?

490
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:29,480
How can you not know this simple stuff?

491
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,560
You lied to me.

492
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,920
I was not! I didn't really save it in time.

493
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,400
It was autosaved.

494
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:49,960
You know that I had to sit all day to redo your work.

495
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:50,760
Jeez!

496
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,600
I think you’re very gifted with all of this

497
00:34:57,720 --> 00:34:58,920
but you have to work harder.

498
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,520
See! In just a span of a few weeks you’re getting so much better.

499
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,920
Is that you giving me a compliment?

500
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,200
Is there anyone else in the room with us?

501
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:37,800
P’Prim, oh my god!

502
00:35:55,400 --> 00:35:57,000
What is it? Why are you staring at me like that?

503
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:03,160
I saw that you were talking with my grandpa.

504
00:36:03,760 --> 00:36:04,960
The conversation seemed to last quite a while.

505
00:36:06,880 --> 00:36:07,720
What were you talking about?

506
00:36:10,280 --> 00:36:11,280
I can’t really tell you that.

507
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,040
It’s a secret.

508
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,480
So you’re having a secret with me now?

509
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:20,440
Once everything sorts out,

510
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:22,800
you will figure that out yourself once you’re back in Bangkok.

511
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:24,600
Don’t be sad about it, okay?

512
00:36:35,120 --> 00:36:36,560
The view from your house is so nice.

513
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,240
I haven’t really got the chance to sit and take in the moment as much.

514
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,280
The sky reflecting on the water, I really like that.

515
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,520
I might have to come here more often now.

516
00:36:55,440 --> 00:36:57,480
I remembered vividly that there were

517
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:01,600
so many more stars than now.

518
00:37:02,440 --> 00:37:03,040
Hmm?

519
00:37:03,920 --> 00:37:04,640
More than this?

520
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,280
That’s right. So much more beautiful than it is now.

521
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,360
You know what?

522
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:13,520
As a kid I really enjoyed playing in the water.

523
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,240
But now not anymore.

524
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:17,600
Really?

525
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,120
Why is that?

526
00:37:20,120 --> 00:37:21,840
Since I was drowned before.

527
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:23,280
And…

528
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,040
I didn’t even know who was the one that helped me.

529
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,720
Many people said that it was a miracle.

530
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:31,440
I mean I also believed that at the time.

531
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,320
But now I realised

532
00:37:39,720 --> 00:37:40,840
what is the actual reason.

533
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,080
But anyway.

534
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:52,040
So…

535
00:37:54,360 --> 00:37:55,840
what were you talking to my grandpa about?

536
00:37:56,400 --> 00:37:58,840
Can you tell me please? Please??

537
00:37:59,760 --> 00:38:01,040
I really want to know.

538
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:02,640
Tell me please?

539
00:38:03,040 --> 00:38:04,920
Why do you want to know about this stuff?

540
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:07,320
Because I want to.

541
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:09,400
Do tell me please?

542
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:09,960
No, I can’t.

543
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:11,160
What!?

544
00:38:13,680 --> 00:38:15,560
All that I can tell you now is…

545
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,240
I love you.

546
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:28,920
You know what?

547
00:38:29,800 --> 00:38:32,080
This is the first time ever

548
00:38:32,080 --> 00:38:33,760
that you told me that you love me.

549
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:38,200
You’re making me shy now.

550
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,960
And you know

551
00:38:45,680 --> 00:38:46,160
that…

552
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:49,920
I also love you too, Khun Dad.

553
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,080
Even if you don’t say it out,

554
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:58,760
I already knew that.

555
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:52,360
P’Sun!

556
00:39:53,240 --> 00:39:54,320
If someone saw us and tell on my dad,

557
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:56,240
you will be in big trouble.

558
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:58,760
You’re not afraid of him?

559
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,480
I am not.

560
00:40:01,680 --> 00:40:02,480
Are you afraid of him?

561
00:40:03,280 --> 00:40:03,760
I am.

562
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:05,720
Khun Dad!

563
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:09,000
Khun Dad! Someone will actually see us!

564
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,200
Stop doing that to me.

565
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,160
You should take a shower now.

566
00:40:20,040 --> 00:40:20,600
P’Sun!

567
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,280
Let get you to shower now.

568
00:40:22,880 --> 00:40:23,720
Can you get up?

569
00:40:24,600 --> 00:40:25,240
Get up now!

570
00:40:26,600 --> 00:40:30,480
Let’s go. Let’s get going.

571
00:40:33,880 --> 00:40:37,560
P’Sun! Do you really want someone to see us?

572
00:40:43,640 --> 00:40:44,960
Hey! Eat slowly!

573
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:48,080
No need to rush! You’re all wet now.

574
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,840
Since you said that you will pay for the meal,

575
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,480
I’ll eat everything in front of me.

576
00:40:57,280 --> 00:40:58,080
Easy!

577
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,800
All this time,

578
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,760
I never really understand you.

579
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:12,720
Am I that mysterious to you?

580
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:15,600
Well…

581
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:19,320
Sometimes you were very cold to me.

582
00:41:20,080 --> 00:41:21,280
Sometimes you were scolding me

583
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:24,560
but also protecting us at the same time.

584
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:29,440
I know that the reason why you were scolding me so much

585
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,800
is because you want me to improve.

586
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,600
But still I felt hurt.

587
00:41:39,680 --> 00:41:40,600
You’re drinking too much now.

588
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,800
Why do you look so shocked?

589
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:53,000
What is it?

590
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:55,440
Is something biting you?

591
00:41:59,240 --> 00:42:00,080
Fianlly,

592
00:42:01,560 --> 00:42:03,440
you’re smiling at me.

593
00:42:09,840 --> 00:42:10,600
Enough drinking.

594
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:14,320
You’re all drunk now.

595
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,320
I’m not!

596
00:42:23,120 --> 00:42:24,200
Do you know that

597
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:31,640
you look the cutest when you smile.

598
00:42:32,640 --> 00:42:34,240
What a cutey!

599
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,480
I don’t get it.

600
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:42,760
Like honestly, why did you have to

601
00:42:43,640 --> 00:42:46,560
scold me, be cold to me, even tell me to get away from you.

602
00:42:47,480 --> 00:42:49,680
Why did you have to be so mean?

603
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:52,480
What have I done to you?

604
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:13,600
Honestly, it’s not that I don’t like you.

605
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,680
I just don’t want to be close to you.

606
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,440
Why is that?

607
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,080
Did I do something wrong?/It’s because..

608
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:38,160
I like you.

609
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:47,480
I know that I shouldn’t

610
00:43:49,560 --> 00:43:51,720
because you only idolize me.

611
00:43:53,400 --> 00:43:55,760
And on top of that you were also in a relationship.

612
00:43:56,520 --> 00:43:57,520
I don’t really want to get in between you and your boyfriend.

613
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,240
So I did that.

614
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:05,320
Actually, I want to

615
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,320
I’m sorry. I have to go now.

616
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:45,520
Pim?

617
00:45:01,400 --> 00:45:04,040
Thank you so much for

618
00:45:04,200 --> 00:45:07,280
being here and giving the student the guiding advice.

619
00:45:07,440 --> 00:45:08,440
Thank you so much.

620
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:12,920
If you ever need my help you can always tell me.

621
00:45:13,440 --> 00:45:17,800
Alright! But there is a student who’s in another class.

622
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:21,640
She seems to be interested in the faculty that you’re studying now.

623
00:45:22,080 --> 00:45:25,280
I think she’ll be here during lunch time.

624
00:45:25,600 --> 00:45:28,760
Although I haven’t seen her yet.

625
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:31,160
They might be here a little late.

626
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,040
What is her name?

627
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:35,800
Ah.. Her name is Pimnapas.

628
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:38,800
She really admires your work.

629
00:45:39,200 --> 00:45:39,960
Really?

630
00:45:44,320 --> 00:45:45,760
Are you busy?

631
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:48,600
If you are, you can go do your thing now.

632
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:50,240
That’s totally fine. Maybe another chance.

633
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:55,360
Then may I go now?

634
00:45:55,680 --> 00:45:56,400
Of course!

635
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,960
Thank you so much! Travel safely.

636
00:45:58,960 --> 00:45:59,920
Alright.

637
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:00,720
Good bye/Good bye.

638
00:46:01,360 --> 00:46:02,360
Thank you again for being here.

639
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,480
Thanks to you too.

640
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,640
Again, travel safely.

641
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:05,040
Thanks.

642
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:05,560
Bye.

643
00:46:06,320 --> 00:46:08,560
I’ll hurry and go there.

644
00:46:08,840 --> 00:46:09,840
Alright.

645
00:46:21,080 --> 00:46:22,920
Teacher Din! Where is P’Prim now?

646
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:26,560
What?! She already left.

647
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:29,520
Really?

648
00:46:33,280 --> 00:46:34,320
What is her name?

649
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:36,640
You can call her Cha-Om.

650
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:38,880
You’re here now.

651
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:40,480
What are we doing here?

652
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:42,840
We’re here to help them. There’s not enough people.

653
00:46:43,040 --> 00:46:44,960
Since you’re already here. Can you help?

654
00:46:45,080 --> 00:46:46,480
Why are we still doing this? We’re in the fourth year now.

655
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:49,880
Because the sophomore students are not enough. They need our help.

656
00:46:51,760 --> 00:46:52,880
Please? Can you please?

657
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:53,760
Help me please?

658
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:54,840
Since you’re already here anyway.

659
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:56,880
Fine I’ll help.

660
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:58,000
Great!

661
00:47:00,120 --> 00:47:02,000
Can you just pass it to me nicely?

662
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:03,280
Sorry!

663
00:47:04,360 --> 00:47:06,200
Really sorry about that.

664
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:21,760
Is this… yours?

665
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:27,200
Yes, thanks.

666
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:30,720
Everybody gathers here. It’s time now.

667
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:33,120
Gets up now. Quickly!

668
00:47:33,360 --> 00:47:34,560
Come one, stand up.

669
00:47:34,880 --> 00:47:35,760
Oil, comes out to the front.

670
00:47:35,760 --> 00:47:36,520
Stands up now.

671
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:38,600
Don’t be slow. Faster!

672
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,520
Where are you, Oil?

673
00:47:39,760 --> 00:47:41,320
Oil, you are needed here in front so that you can teach your friend how to dance.

674
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:43,320
The grilled chicken song, ready?

675
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:43,640
Yes, we are.

676
00:47:44,120 --> 00:47:45,440
3, 4 and go!

677
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:48,560
The chicken is being grilled, The chicken is being grilled.

678
00:47:48,720 --> 00:47:50,120
It’s about to get skewered. It’s about to get skewered.

679
00:47:50,520 --> 00:47:53,280
Skewering on the left butt. Skewering on the right butt.

680
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:54,840
It’s super hot. It’s super hot.

681
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,360
It’s super hot. It’s super hot.

682
00:47:56,360 --> 00:47:59,360
The chicken is being grilled, The chicken is being grilled.

683
00:48:06,280 --> 00:48:08,400
Can you sign this for me?

684
00:48:09,680 --> 00:48:12,080
How do you know her name?

685
00:48:12,800 --> 00:48:17,040
Ahh.. It’s because I went to the same school as her before.

686
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:23,680
Right.

687
00:48:23,960 --> 00:48:26,760
Are you Pimnapas, a student of teacher Din?

688
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:27,840
You’re right.

689
00:48:29,320 --> 00:48:32,600
I really love all of your work.

690
00:48:32,680 --> 00:48:36,240
Whenever you receive any of the awards I always take pride in it.

691
00:48:36,240 --> 00:48:38,920
You are my biggest idol ever.

692
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:40,800
Thanks.

693
00:48:42,520 --> 00:48:43,000
Really?

694
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:46,480
You’re going to give her the signature that easily because she compliments you.

695
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,240
Look around! How much other people have to do to get a signature.

696
00:48:51,960 --> 00:48:55,320
So if you want her signature, you must do something in exchange.

697
00:49:03,320 --> 00:49:04,120
Yes!

698
00:49:05,560 --> 00:49:06,960
I can speak several languages.

699
00:49:07,440 --> 00:49:10,840
Really? Show her then.

700
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:15,480
Alright.

701
00:49:51,840 --> 00:49:52,640
love you

702
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,080
Everything that I said means I love you.

703
00:50:06,480 --> 00:50:07,640
Keep a straight face!

704
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:22,560
P’Prim! What about my signature?

705
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:25,680
I think she needs to go to the toilet. How about I sign for you?

706
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,520
Hand it to me.

707
00:50:26,520 --> 00:50:27,120
But…

708
00:50:27,560 --> 00:50:29,880
I will sign for you.

709
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:33,080
You’re so popular. A person asked me for your number yesterday.

710
00:50:33,080 --> 00:50:33,960
Really?

711
00:50:33,960 --> 00:50:35,320
Yeah but I didn’t give it to that person.

712
00:50:36,440 --> 00:50:38,120
I didn’t know if you would like him.

713
00:50:38,240 --> 00:50:42,520
Yeah, I don’t think I would like him but who is he?

714
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:45,880
I don’t know so I didn’t give him your number.

715
00:50:46,080 --> 00:50:49,200
I actually was with Lin, I think he is Ruay (Rich in Thai).

716
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:50,400
He is rich?

717
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,800
I mean his name is Ruay.

718
00:51:00,520 --> 00:51:01,280
It’s time to go to study now.

719
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:01,960
Really?

720
00:51:02,120 --> 00:51:02,560
Hurry!

721
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:06,480
Pim, this bouquet of flowers is for you.

722
00:51:09,880 --> 00:51:10,640
Just take it.

723
00:51:12,680 --> 00:51:14,120
Thank you.

724
00:51:19,120 --> 00:51:20,000
Is this for real?

725
00:51:20,840 --> 00:51:22,440
Pim.

726
00:51:24,400 --> 00:51:26,200
I have something to tell you.

727
00:51:28,720 --> 00:51:30,520
I really like you.

728
00:51:36,640 --> 00:51:37,920
Would you like to be my girlfriend?

729
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:38,960
Is this really happening?

730
00:51:42,920 --> 00:51:44,520
Yes or No ?

731
00:51:45,960 --> 00:51:46,880
Which ones should I choose?

732
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:53,840
Yes !!!!!!!!

733
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,640
Yes, I do!

734
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:01,720
Thank you.

735
00:52:17,080 --> 00:52:19,960
I think that she just idolizes you.

736
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:46,400
P’Kaew gives me so much work!

737
00:52:48,520 --> 00:52:52,160
Wow! Primrada, you’re here at the right time.

738
00:52:52,240 --> 00:52:55,000
These are some of the documents for you from P’Kaew.

739
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:56,360
What documents are these?

740
00:52:56,360 --> 00:52:59,720
These are documents of the new interns.

741
00:53:00,000 --> 00:53:02,080
There are so many people sent in their resumes.

742
00:53:02,080 --> 00:53:05,360
And P’Kaew wants you to choose the right interns for us.

743
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:10,080
I have a thing to do so I can’t do this.

744
00:53:10,280 --> 00:53:13,160
I also want to help you but too bad, I’m too busy.

745
00:53:13,400 --> 00:53:14,600
Please take care of that.

746
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:16,200
Of course.

747
00:53:16,280 --> 00:53:21,120
I already sent in the videos of the interns in your Line as well.

748
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,520
Please look at that.

749
00:53:23,160 --> 00:53:24,200
Thanks for your help!

750
00:53:31,600 --> 00:53:35,120
Hello, I am Pimnapas Pipatanakul.

751
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:38,680
Why do you want to do your internship here?

752
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:42,160
Because this is my dream company.

753
00:53:42,560 --> 00:53:45,840
It is where I want to learn from.

754
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,600
Specifically, there is a person whom I really admire.

755
00:54:01,160 --> 00:54:01,880
Why am I smiling?

756
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:18,200
Prim, perfect timing.

757
00:54:18,200 --> 00:54:20,680
Why don’t you introduce yourself to the new interns?

758
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:57,840
President?

759
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:03,840
Where is he?

760
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:18,960
President! Where have you been for the past few days?

761
00:55:21,880 --> 00:55:22,800
You’re on a mountain!

762
00:55:23,600 --> 00:55:27,240
But you have a board meeting in 15 minutes.

763
00:55:27,600 --> 00:55:28,840
Will you get back here in time?

764
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:31,160
Everyone is watching you now. Don’t forget about that.

765
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:38,120
What about…

766
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:41,400
President!

767
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:43,600
Is he for real?

768
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,360
Madame Wan, as an advisor of the president,

769
00:56:03,360 --> 00:56:05,600
I can’t let this go.

770
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:07,480
Calm down!

771
00:56:08,040 --> 00:56:10,840
Even though he’s been absent for a week

772
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:16,120
but he was on fire before. I heard that he kept on checking the accounting department.

773
00:56:18,040 --> 00:56:19,880
More like kept on causing trouble.

774
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,320
Our company's accounting has always been transparent.

775
00:56:22,720 --> 00:56:25,720
I don’t know why he kept insisting to check on that so much.

776
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:32,040
The fact that all of you call in for an emergency meeting while the president is absent

777
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,960
is it just to complain about him?

778
00:56:36,520 --> 00:56:38,920
It’s not even 3 months yet.

779
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:42,960
And don’t you guys worry I alway keep my words.

780
00:56:43,440 --> 00:56:45,840
Our company can really wait until 3 months?

781
00:56:46,040 --> 00:56:48,760
It’s only been 2 months and it is a mess now.

782
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,000
Anyone know where is he now?

783
00:56:55,080 --> 00:56:55,880
That’s right.

784
00:56:56,640 --> 00:56:57,440
Where is he?

785
00:57:03,000 --> 00:57:07,560
He has a meeting

786
00:57:07,560 --> 00:57:10,080
I mean he’s on a business trip in another province.

787
00:57:10,360 --> 00:57:13,840
He’s there with an intern from the designing department right?

788
00:57:17,560 --> 00:57:20,920
No wonder that my HR department got left behind.

789
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:23,400
He shifted the budget to the designing department by two or three times more.

790
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:27,480
What about the new collection? There is absolutely nothing new coming out yet.

791
00:57:27,480 --> 00:57:29,840
Do you have any explanation, Kaewmanee?

792
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:33,520
I have no clues about that either.

793
00:57:33,960 --> 00:57:37,120
But the last design we haven’t made any order to the production team just yet.

794
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:40,080
I have to wait for the approval from the president.

795
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,600
Really? Are we going to send that to the supplier on time?

796
00:57:44,320 --> 00:57:47,920
Madame! We can keep waiting on this.

797
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:48,880
That’s right.

798
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:51,920
I agree with him that we can’t keep on waiting.

799
00:57:51,920 --> 00:57:54,400
Otherwise, our company will definitely suffer huge losses.

800
00:57:54,400 --> 00:57:59,880
Or do you want to see your own company crumble down to the ground by your own son?

801
00:58:20,640 --> 00:58:21,560
Salin!

802
00:58:22,320 --> 00:58:23,720
Help me!

803
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,120
Help me please, Salin!

804
00:58:34,120 --> 00:58:38,000
Salin, I need your help.

805
00:58:40,680 --> 00:58:41,960
I’m right here.

806
00:58:42,080 --> 00:58:44,160
Help!

807
00:58:59,920 --> 00:59:03,160
Lin! Lin!

808
00:59:41,880 --> 00:59:43,520
Let’s get the meeting started.

809
00:59:43,520 --> 00:59:45,040
I have investigated something.

810
00:59:45,040 --> 00:59:49,120
And found out ways of fraud that have been carried out subtly and for a long time.

811
00:59:50,080 --> 00:59:54,040
I feel like I need to show you something in my home.

812
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:57,280
Is it really okay with your mom?

813
00:59:57,880 --> 01:00:00,040
Can we see the ancient painting of that man that you have?

814
01:00:00,560 --> 01:00:04,440
This is a painting of the person who saved my life forty years ago

815
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,080
The painting of Lord Phaya Suriyen.
