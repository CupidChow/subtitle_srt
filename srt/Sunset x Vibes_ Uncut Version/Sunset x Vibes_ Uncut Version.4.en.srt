1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:07,760
I think our relationship,

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,720
we have to keep it a secret.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:11,560
Thank you for caring about me.

4
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:12,640
What really happened in Hong Kong?

5
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:13,680
Yeah?

6
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:14,760
Who were you with?

7
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:16,840
I have drafted the jewelry design.

8
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:18,360
Would you mind taking a look at it?

9
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:21,000
The little details are missing. It’s like you are still a student.

10
00:00:21,280 --> 00:00:22,200
I’m worried!

11
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,520
People might find out when we’re together.

12
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,160
I want you to be a little more open.

13
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,360
You want me to open up to you so that we can be friends?

14
00:00:29,600 --> 00:00:30,640
You pulled an all-nighter again?

15
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:34,480
If you’re working too much, your body may not be able to take it.

16
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,360
Everybody!

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:38,280
I bought you some snacks.

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:40,880
This is yours, Pim.

19
00:00:42,080 --> 00:00:44,160
This is for Lin.

20
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,040
Thanks.

21
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:46,240
What about me?

22
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:47,080
None for you.

23
00:00:48,040 --> 00:00:49,000
These are mine.

24
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:53,280
I’ll be right back.

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,560
I’ll go get a cup of coffee.

26
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:56,680
Want anything?

27
00:00:56,720 --> 00:00:57,560
I’m O.K.

28
00:00:57,560 --> 00:00:58,240
No, thanks.

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:00,640
Then you guys please help take a look at my design while I’m gone.

30
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:30,200
Lin!

31
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:36,360
The offer of Mr. Kelly

32
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:38,360
might be intriguing but

33
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,160
the price of his rough diamonds

34
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:43,080
with the shipping

35
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,680
is still not that good.

36
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:48,840
The thing is we’ve been partnering with him for many years now.

37
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:51,039
We can’t just ask for a new sales pitch.

38
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:52,880
It might cause us to lose our connection over the years.

39
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,200
Just a moment.

40
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,200
Hello, Sam.

41
00:02:02,480 --> 00:02:03,760
This is an emergency.

42
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,720
Lin just fainted.

43
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:05,480
What!?

44
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:06,760
Fainted!

45
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:08,800
Alright, just a second.

46
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,360
Chan?

47
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:18,120
Hey!

48
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:20,200
Out of the way!

49
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,400
I think we should hurry and take him to the hospital.

50
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:23,240
Out of the way!

51
00:02:23,240 --> 00:02:23,760
Out!

52
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:33,720
No need to!

53
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,320
I will take him to the hospital myself.

54
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,040
Yotha plase move away.

55
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:45,120
Let me take care of this.

56
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,160
Oppa!

57
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,920
What are you two waiting for?

58
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:52,720
Hurry!

59
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:55,560
Lin!

60
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,000
No need to worry.

61
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:07,240
He just doesn’t get enough rest

62
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:08,800
so he blacked out.

63
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:12,160
The doctors gave him some I.V. fluids.

64
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:13,640
I think he’ll wake up soon.

65
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:15,240
That’s good.

66
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:16,600
Thank you so much.

67
00:04:18,240 --> 00:04:18,920
Er..

68
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:22,480
Normally, isn’t this room for executive members?

69
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,840
Yes!

70
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:27,360
The normal room

71
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:30,000
is at such a different level.

72
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:32,000
Double standard!

73
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:35,280
It is under renovation at the moment.

74
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,800
I think it will be available for you all shortly after.

75
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:41,280
Really!

76
00:04:42,640 --> 00:04:43,600
Really?

77
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:46,840
The rooms are going to be just like this one?

78
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,800
I think so.

79
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:54,800
Wow! Our president!

80
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,120
Not only is he handsome but he is also very kind.

81
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:00,800
He’s got everything in one.

82
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:02,480
Take it easy!

83
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:04,000
I’m sorry

84
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:06,240
Well, excuse me then.

85
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:07,520
Make yourself comfortable.

86
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:08,920
Thank you.

87
00:05:13,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Oh!

88
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:15,600
Wow!

89
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,920
Amazing!

90
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,920
Red tulips!

91
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,760
What a pleasure to sit here!

92
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,280
Is it that good?

93
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:31,560
Wow! I love it.

94
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:32,640
Comfortable?

95
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:33,560
Very much so!

96
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,200
Maybe you should get sick sometime.

97
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,080
Pim!

98
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:06,400
Lin?

99
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:07,760
Yo!

100
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,960
Lin’s awake.

101
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:11,440
Lin

102
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:13,200
Get up slowly.

103
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,200
Is this a hospital?

104
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:20,480
You guys didn’t tell my dad right?

105
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:23,120
No and this is not a hospital.

106
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,400
This is just a first aid room at the executive building.

107
00:06:26,960 --> 00:06:27,720
What!?

108
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,000
A first aid room at the executive building!

109
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:31,760
Yes,

110
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,880
You literally collapsed on the floor

111
00:06:34,159 --> 00:06:35,600
and we had no Idea what to do.

112
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:37,920
We took you to an employee first-aid room

113
00:06:38,159 --> 00:06:39,159
but it is under construction.

114
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,280
So the president let us use this room.

115
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:46,400
This is actually a very nice room.

116
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:50,680
They even have doctors and nurses to take care of you for 20 hours.

117
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,400
Here!

118
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:54,320
Over here Lin!

119
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:56,280
They even have your favorite flower.

120
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:58,280
Red tulips.

121
00:06:59,560 --> 00:07:00,880
Very beautiful.

122
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,000
Thank you.

123
00:07:05,720 --> 00:07:07,400
Moreover,

124
00:07:07,880 --> 00:07:10,600
the sofa here is very soft.

125
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:11,680
Isn’t that so, Pim?

126
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:12,400
Yes!

127
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:14,360
I love it, Lin.

128
00:07:16,640 --> 00:07:17,440
Erm..

129
00:07:17,880 --> 00:07:19,200
Don’t you two need to work?

130
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:20,440
Right?!

131
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,560
We slept until we lost count of the time.

132
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,440
What do we do?

133
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:27,000
Are you alright by yourself?

134
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,280
I’m fine by myself.

135
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:32,240
You two better get back to work.

136
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:34,080
Pim, let’s go.

137
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,880
We’ll be right back.

138
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:41,480
We’ll be back soon. Rest well okay?

139
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,120
Are these from the president?

140
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,000
สวัสดีครับพี่ชาญ

141
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:12,880
Hello, P’Chan.

142
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,160
Ah, Hello to you too.

143
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:16,640
How do you feel now?

144
00:08:21,760 --> 00:08:23,120
I’m feeling so much better.

145
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:25,960
May I?

146
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,080
I think I forgot it in Lin’s recovery room.

147
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,720
Are you really looking hard for it?

148
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,039
I am.

149
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:44,280
Huh!

150
00:08:44,520 --> 00:08:47,160
The other day you forgot your wallet and today it’s your phone.

151
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,360
Have you ever heard that

152
00:08:48,520 --> 00:08:50,520
forgetful people are always the cutest ones.

153
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:01,880
Just open the door!

154
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:02,520
Shit!

155
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,760
Or the person that Lin told us about

156
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,960
is the secretary of the president?

157
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,040
Do you want to know about this?

158
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:17,840
We have to find out then.

159
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:20,200
You all are right here!

160
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:21,840
Hey!

161
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:24,400
You said that you were going to visit Lin

162
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:26,840
but you’ve been gone for half the day.

163
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:28,240
Don’t you two want to work here anymore?

164
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:31,640
No, it’s not that.

165
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:33,000
What is it then?

166
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,520
What are you two looking at?

167
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,480
Nothing!

168
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:37,000
Move!

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:38,760
Wow, I’m suddenly eager to work.

170
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:39,800
That’s right.

171
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:41,240
What is this?

172
00:09:41,320 --> 00:09:42,240
Let’s get back to work.

173
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:42,560
Let’s go.

174
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:43,400
Let me have a look first.

175
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,600
No need to!

176
00:09:44,840 --> 00:09:45,480
What’s in there?

177
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,880
Here wo go!

178
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:56,080
Oh! Sorry about that.

179
00:09:57,760 --> 00:09:58,680
Looks like you no longer have a fever.

180
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,840
Feeling better now.

181
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:01,800
Really?

182
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,920
I think I should get back to work then.

183
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,400
Wait, wait, wait.

184
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:08,280
What’s the rush?

185
00:10:08,280 --> 00:10:10,840
You should get some more rest.

186
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:13,840
But I don’t have any fever.

187
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,360
I better get back to work now.

188
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,120
Calm down.

189
00:10:19,280 --> 00:10:21,880
I don’t think you should get back to work now.

190
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:26,640
Oh! President.

191
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:30,240
I told Lin to get some more rest

192
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:31,720
but he doesn’t really listen to me.

193
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,560
I got this.

194
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:41,720
Well, in that case I must go.

195
00:10:55,280 --> 00:10:56,120
Lin

196
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:57,800
How are you doing?

197
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,280
Did you get hurt?

198
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:01,000
I’m better now.

199
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,600
No fever anymore?

200
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:06,880
It’s nice that you’re getting better

201
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:10,800
but from now on you have to rest more alright?

202
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:14,400
If you’re working too much and this happens again.

203
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,760
I’ll make you quit.

204
00:11:16,080 --> 00:11:16,920
What?

205
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,360
Am I going to get fired?

206
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:22,800
It’s because I’m doing a company’s deed.

207
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,480
I don’t like it if you get sick.

208
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,800
But if you tell me to stop doing what I love

209
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:33,000
I won’t like that either.

210
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,040
Lin

211
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,440
You need to rest more.

212
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,480
Don’t make me worry about you okay?

213
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,440
Let’s see, if you’re listen to me

214
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:50,760
and recover fast.

215
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,440
I’ll show you something.

216
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:54,920
What is it?

217
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:57,560
You just have to look at it at my home.

218
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,520
Do you trust me?

219
00:12:03,400 --> 00:12:04,360
Of course, I do.

220
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:06,360
I’ll get back to sleep now

221
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:08,360
so that I’ll get better quicker.

222
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:15,120
Aren’t you going back to work?

223
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:16,560
I want to rest.

224
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,080
Thanks!

225
00:12:30,200 --> 00:12:31,360
You can go.

226
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:36,120
Have a good dream.

227
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:36,800
Thanks.

228
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:40,040
Bye bye!

229
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,320
P’Sun!

230
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:07,800
Can you go slower than this?

231
00:13:08,080 --> 00:13:09,440
I’m scared.

232
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:12,080
What?

233
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:16,160
Are you really going to turn my super cool car into a grandfather car?

234
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:21,920
It’s better this way.

235
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,120
It’s more safe. Slow but sure.

236
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:34,360
Er..

237
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:35,960
Actually, you can go faster than this.

238
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:40,200
Okay now?

239
00:13:48,280 --> 00:13:49,080
What!?

240
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:50,280
Lin is on sick leave?

241
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:51,840
Yes!

242
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,200
What’s wrong?

243
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,560
Why didn’t he tell us anything?

244
00:13:56,560 --> 00:13:58,040
Yeah, How did you know that?

245
00:13:58,040 --> 00:13:59,960
Have you two not checked our group chat?

246
00:14:00,200 --> 00:14:01,600
If you don’t believe me why don’t check it yourself.

247
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,160
Are you for real?

248
00:14:02,640 --> 00:14:03,840
That’s true.

249
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:04,600
Yeah!

250
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,600
I should try calling him.

251
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:08,320
Call him now.

252
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:12,760
Answer?

253
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,320
No.

254
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:17,880
Really!

255
00:14:18,520 --> 00:14:19,520
I’m going crazy now.

256
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,840
He isn’t the person who doesn’t pick up the phone.

257
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:22,960
He always takes my call.

258
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:24,840
He’s never been like this before.

259
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:28,840
I’m worried now since he’s sick alone at his condo.

260
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:33,120
He’s never alone when he’s sick.

261
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:34,240
Something

262
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,400
you don’t need to say.

263
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:38,520
Do you want him to get sick or something?

264
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:41,120
You think so negatively about me.

265
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:43,440
I said that I’m worried about him. Right Pim?

266
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:46,160
Enough, Yo. Stop trying to pick a fight with Sam.

267
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:48,680
I agree with Sam.

268
00:14:49,520 --> 00:14:52,000
I don’t know if Lin’s dead or alive.

269
00:14:52,840 --> 00:14:53,720
Normally,

270
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:56,200
Lin is not someone who’s going quiet for this long.

271
00:14:59,000 --> 00:14:59,800
Maybe

272
00:15:01,320 --> 00:15:02,400
We should go and check on him.

273
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:05,120
Hey, wait, wait.

274
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:05,520
What?

275
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:07,400
You haven’t finished any of your work.

276
00:15:07,400 --> 00:15:08,760
I want to go see my friend.

277
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:10,080
Lin matters more than the work.

278
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:12,280
Three of you are going to take a leave of absence?

279
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,160
Who’s going to work?

280
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:17,040
We can’t get in touch with Lin.

281
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:19,880
So we got scared that something bad might happen.

282
00:15:20,440 --> 00:15:21,920
That’s right.

283
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,120
He just fainted in the middle of the office yesterday.

284
00:15:25,520 --> 00:15:27,800
If he’s alone and blacked out, who would help him?

285
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,040
No one would be there to help him.

286
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:32,640
I understand that you’re worried about your friend.

287
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:35,960
But it doesn’t make any sense to let all three of you go.

288
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:39,400
We couldn't get a word from him ever since this morning.

289
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:43,680
What should we do if it is bad?

290
00:15:43,880 --> 00:15:47,440
You can’t just take a leave of absence like this. You need to tell me in advance.

291
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:49,360
You can’t just go whenever you feel like it.

292
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,760
What if it’s an accident?

293
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:52,600
Like I said

294
00:15:52,960 --> 00:15:55,600
that we couldn’t get in touch with him since the morning.

295
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:00,480
Fine, if you can’t really contact him

296
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,200
I’ll let one of you go and check up on him during lunch break.

297
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:05,640
Really!/Really?

298
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,720
Thank you!

299
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:09,560
Thank you so much!

300
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,680
You’ll move all of these into the document room right?

301
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,640
Let me help you.

302
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,400
Stop!

303
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,040
I haven’t really gone through all of these yet.

304
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,440
Thanks.

305
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:24,720
You two better get back to work.

306
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:28,560
O.K, then please excuse us.

307
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:39,080
Do you think she gets paranoid with us touching her document?

308
00:16:40,200 --> 00:16:41,520
Maybe a little.

309
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,480
It’s probably nothing.

310
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:46,160
At the moment,

311
00:16:46,520 --> 00:16:48,360
all I can think about is Lin.

312
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,520
I don’t know how he is.

313
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:53,360
We have to do as P’Kaewmanee said.

314
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
If we still couldn’t get in touch with him,

315
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,520
I’ll go check on him this evening.

316
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:00,600
Okay

317
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,240
Look!

318
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:04,119
What is it?

319
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:08,319
Is that P’Chan,the secretary of the president?

320
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:15,000
Yeah!

321
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,000
I think so.

322
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:18,079
What is he doing here?

323
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,359
Good then!

324
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:27,319
Today, I’ll clear things up with him about him and Lin.

325
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,800
The nosiness of me is on fire.

326
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:32,680
Let's go.

327
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,320
There he is.

328
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:42,160
Huh!

329
00:17:42,680 --> 00:17:44,600
What’s the matter?

330
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:46,800
Can’t we just meet up?

331
00:17:47,040 --> 00:17:49,320
Who is he talking to? I can’t really see one.

332
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,000
It’s fine. No one will see us.

333
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:54,440
If you keep acting like this I don’t want to talk to you anymore.

334
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:56,400
I think we should get a tiny bit closer.

335
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,400
Becareful, he’ll see you.

336
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,280
Oh!

337
00:18:03,080 --> 00:18:04,800
P’Juladis?

338
00:18:05,560 --> 00:18:08,440
If we do this too often, someone else might see us.

339
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:09,960
What are we going to do then?

340
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,920
You have to be more understanding please.

341
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,160
Let me look.

342
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:15,680
Oh wow!

343
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:21,120
You look really good today, perfect hair, handsome face, and dressed very well.

344
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:23,520
How can a person look this good?

345
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,480
Let me give you a kiss.

346
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:28,720
Feeling better now?

347
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,400
Not yet!

348
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:31,800
Why?

349
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:34,120
What else can I do for you?

350
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,800
You have to do so much more than this.

351
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:38,800
And…

352
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,800
How much more?

353
00:18:49,480 --> 00:18:50,280
What are they going to do?

354
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:52,760
Much more like this.

355
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,040
Someone will see this?

356
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:05,000
Crap!

357
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:06,520
Oh!

358
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:10,800
Take it, take it. We need it as evidence.

359
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:16,720
I’m zooming in really close so it’s clear what they are doing.

360
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,240
Chan!

361
00:19:22,440 --> 00:19:25,680
He’s such a shitty person. Is Lin not enough for him?

362
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,760
How dare he kiss someone else.

363
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,480
You’re right!

364
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,080
Something happened ?

365
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
Yo and Lin,

366
00:19:43,040 --> 00:19:45,640
They called me multiple times now?

367
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:47,680
I don’t know if something happens.

368
00:19:49,080 --> 00:19:50,680
Why don’t you call them back?

369
00:19:54,920 --> 00:19:55,720
Alright.

370
00:20:03,760 --> 00:20:05,680
How can I tell Lin this?

371
00:20:08,120 --> 00:20:08,920
Hey!

372
00:20:10,200 --> 00:20:11,400
It’s luch break now.

373
00:20:11,960 --> 00:20:13,240
I think I better go to see Lin myself.

374
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:14,760
Ops! Lin’s calling.

375
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:16,920
Hurry and answer.

376
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:18,120
Hello, Lin.

377
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,040
Hello.

378
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:20,120
How are you?

379
00:20:20,120 --> 00:20:22,080
Why don’t you tell us that you were going to take sick leave?

380
00:20:22,280 --> 00:20:23,840
Yeah, you tell us nothing.

381
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:26,800
Sorry about that.

382
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,080
I was feeling under the weather.

383
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,640
But, I got some sleep

384
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:33,560
so I’m feeling so much better now.

385
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:34,560
Sleep?

386
00:20:38,000 --> 00:20:40,160
What are you doing now? Still sleeping?

387
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,360
Yeah, what are you doing?

388
00:20:42,200 --> 00:20:43,200
Yeah, yeah.

389
00:20:44,600 --> 00:20:45,680
Still sleeping.

390
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:51,600
I was on my way out to see you. P’Kaewmanee allowed me to go check on you.

391
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,400
Where are you? Can you tell us?

392
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,080
You don’t have to.

393
00:20:57,480 --> 00:20:59,520
I’m feeling a lot better now.

394
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:02,000
Another thing is..

395
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,200
My Dad is here to visit me.

396
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:07,880
But, we’re really worried about you.

397
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:10,920
Have you had anything to eat since you’ve been sleeping all day?

398
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,080
I have.

399
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:15,080
I ate and went to sleep.

400
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,920
I think I’ll go back to sleep now.

401
00:21:17,240 --> 00:21:18,920
Thanks for worrying about me.

402
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,880
Alright!

403
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,000
Got you.

404
00:21:26,280 --> 00:21:27,160
Well, then

405
00:21:27,920 --> 00:21:29,640
take care of yourself okay?

406
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:31,680
Don’t forget to take your medicine.

407
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:35,160
Tell us right away if you need anything.

408
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:38,160
Thanks, see you soon.

409
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:39,520
Get well soon.

410
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,200
He already hung up.

411
00:21:41,960 --> 00:21:44,800
I thought something bad happened.

412
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,560
Go, go, go.

413
00:21:47,240 --> 00:21:48,800
Go back to work.

414
00:21:52,440 --> 00:21:53,560
Almost got caught.

415
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:55,800
Wait?

416
00:21:56,760 --> 00:22:00,200
Didn’t you tell me that you’re a bad liar?

417
00:22:02,560 --> 00:22:05,400
Do I look like I’m a good liar?

418
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:07,560
Umm.

419
00:22:09,040 --> 00:22:09,840
No?

420
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,520
It doesn’t look very realistic.

421
00:22:28,360 --> 00:22:31,160
Why don’t you try to follow the design? I think it would look better.

422
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,320
What are we going to do?

423
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:36,800
About the secretary of the president.

424
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:42,000
Yo?

425
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:44,640
Yo!

426
00:22:45,040 --> 00:22:45,840
Yes?

427
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:47,080
What are you staring at?

428
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:50,840
No nothing, I was looking at the curtains.

429
00:22:52,560 --> 00:22:55,280
Tonight, can we go home together? I have a sleepover with someone around there.

430
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:57,560
Hey!

431
00:22:58,000 --> 00:22:59,360
That’s Sam.

432
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,280
Since when did he know anyone from another department?

433
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,640
Go ask him then.

434
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:07,200
Look at that.

435
00:23:07,560 --> 00:23:11,200
That woman is really something. She has long hair.

436
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,840
And even a beautiful face.

437
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:14,800
Ops!

438
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,040
She’s stunning.

439
00:23:22,120 --> 00:23:23,120
So proud of him.

440
00:23:24,040 --> 00:23:26,520
Come on, Yo. Let’s go home.

441
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:27,200
Pim

442
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:29,640
Can I go back with you and your boyfriend?

443
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:30,720
What!?

444
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,560
But your house and my house are so far apart.

445
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:34,920
Yeah, I know.

446
00:23:36,280 --> 00:23:37,720
Just get me as close to my house as you can.

447
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:39,120
I feel a lot more comfortable

448
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:41,960
with you.

449
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:45,400
I’ll be waiting for you outside then.

450
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,040
Yo!

451
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,040
Sam?

452
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:55,840
Is that your girlfriend?

453
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:56,640
No!

454
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:59,760
She asked me for some advice so I helped her.

455
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:02,720
Why do you have to look so suspicious?

456
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:05,640
No! Really! She’s not even my type.

457
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:08,360
I have my type.

458
00:24:08,360 --> 00:24:09,120
Really?

459
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:12,520
how is your type?

460
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:15,520
My type? Maybe..

461
00:24:16,520 --> 00:24:17,520
I won’t tell you that.

462
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:19,400
Why?

463
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:21,960
It’s none of your business. Just go home already.

464
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,280
Go, go. Fast!

465
00:24:23,280 --> 00:24:24,880
You’re so annoying!

466
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:26,880
See you then!

467
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:28,040
See you, bye.

468
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,280
What’s wrong with him again?

469
00:24:35,480 --> 00:24:36,760
Why is he mad at me?

470
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:51,440
How is it? Excited?

471
00:24:52,600 --> 00:24:53,920
Yes, I’m so excited.

472
00:24:54,200 --> 00:24:55,520
Let’s get inside.

473
00:24:55,520 --> 00:24:56,320
Let’s go.

474
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:16,360
This way please.

475
00:25:16,360 --> 00:25:17,120
Alright.

476
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:29,920
Down there?

477
00:25:37,920 --> 00:25:38,720
Please come down.

478
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,360
Thanks.

479
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:54,360
Wow!

480
00:25:55,040 --> 00:25:55,920
These are so beautiful.

481
00:25:58,120 --> 00:25:58,920
This is the room that

482
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,960
my parents used it to keep all the antique jewelry pieces.

483
00:26:06,920 --> 00:26:07,720
P’Sun!

484
00:26:08,360 --> 00:26:09,160
Is that…

485
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,240
Star of the Promise?

486
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,480
The third collection of Soul High right?

487
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:20,120
I remembered that it was a really famous collection.

488
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,160
It was like the talk of the town.

489
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:24,520
How can you remember that?

490
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,160
It was a long time ago.

491
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:29,800
I’m like a real fan of Soul High jewelry.

492
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:32,320
Wow!

493
00:26:33,040 --> 00:26:34,840
It looks so beautiful in person.

494
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:37,320
This is a sight for sore eyes.

495
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:39,120
Wow!

496
00:26:39,960 --> 00:26:40,920
The details are so neat.

497
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:44,400
You know what I can even remember the concept of this.

498
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:51,600
A prayer from the twinkling stars is a promise to the loved one.

499
00:26:53,160 --> 00:26:53,960
So romantic.

500
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:00,000
You know the magical elements of the jewelry is the story behind it.

501
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,760
And the creator of the beauty of all these

502
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
is a jewelry designer.

503
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:10,600
P’Sun?

504
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,800
Why did you take me here?

505
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,360
I saw that you were so happy

506
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:23,360
when you were looking at the jewelry pieces in Hong Kong.

507
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:25,880
Ahh..

508
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:28,240
That’s why I want you to see these.

509
00:27:29,240 --> 00:27:30,680
Maybe it can inspire you

510
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,040
for your next piece.

511
00:27:36,400 --> 00:27:37,360
And I hope

512
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:38,960
I hope that maybe

513
00:27:40,840 --> 00:27:43,000
the future jewelry designer of Soul High

514
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,240
will be you.

515
00:27:50,840 --> 00:27:51,840
Thank you so much.

516
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:53,920
Thank you so much for this.

517
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:56,560
These jewelry are so exquisite.

518
00:27:57,800 --> 00:27:59,520
How long can I be here?

519
00:27:59,520 --> 00:28:02,520
As much as you want.

520
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:06,800
Really? I don’t want to disturb you.

521
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,800
Because I really look at all these I think it’s going to be late by then.

522
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,800
It’s fine.

523
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:17,200
You can even sleep here tonight.

524
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,000
Well then I think I should go and prepare you a bed.

525
00:28:23,120 --> 00:28:24,000
Make yourself at home.

526
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:25,440
Is it really okay?

527
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:29,760
Alright then.

528
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:31,880
Make yourself comfortable!

529
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,680
Yes.

530
00:29:46,800 --> 00:29:47,840
We need to talk.

531
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:48,680
Hey!

532
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:50,240
Wait!

533
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,120
What is your problem?

534
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:54,040
I don’t have any problem.

535
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,280
Don’t lie to me.

536
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,440
How can you not have any problem?

537
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:57,920
Look at you now.

538
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:00,000
Why are you following me?

539
00:30:00,400 --> 00:30:01,920
because I want to know what’s wrong with you.

540
00:30:02,440 --> 00:30:03,440
There is nothing wrong with me.

541
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,360
Is everything alright?

542
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:07,720
Hello.

543
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,640
Everthing’s fine.

544
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:12,560
You can go and wait inside. I’ll be inside soon.

545
00:30:16,560 --> 00:30:18,560
Why don’t we talk inside?

546
00:30:18,560 --> 00:30:19,120
Stop!

547
00:30:20,600 --> 00:30:21,160
What?

548
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:26,240
Let’s go talk elsewhere,

549
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:27,400
Not right here.

550
00:30:29,080 --> 00:30:30,000
Follow me then.

551
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:40,200
Huh!

552
00:30:42,240 --> 00:30:43,920
Why are you avoiding me?

553
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:46,520
I’m not. When was I avoiding you?

554
00:30:47,800 --> 00:30:48,600
What’s your problem?

555
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,000
So why when I told you that I wanted to go home with you but you went with Pim instead?

556
00:30:51,960 --> 00:30:52,720
Well..

557
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:53,680
I just saw your text.

558
00:30:54,160 --> 00:30:55,760
You’re lying.

559
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:56,760
What’s wrong with you?

560
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,240
So we can sort things out.

561
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,120
Why do you have to care about me?

562
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,040
Why don’t you just go and care for someone who you truly care about?

563
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,600
That person is right here with me.

564
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:14,080
You..

565
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:16,840
What do you mean by that?

566
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,920
Your house is in a deep and isolated alley.

567
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,560
What if something happens to you?

568
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:23,520
So what?

569
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,240
I’ve been walking in this alley alone for 10 years now.

570
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,560
And nothing ever happened to me.

571
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,920
But I want to go home with you.

572
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,360
Just in case something bad happens.

573
00:31:33,920 --> 00:31:35,120
So that you can protect me.

574
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:40,600
You’re really..

575
00:31:40,760 --> 00:31:41,280
What?

576
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:43,440
What am I really?

577
00:31:44,160 --> 00:31:45,440
I really lost all the words to talk to you.

578
00:31:45,720 --> 00:31:47,200
Me too.

579
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:56,360
Fo real?

580
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,400
Why does it have to growl now?

581
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:01,840
Yo, If your stomach growls this loud.

582
00:32:02,280 --> 00:32:03,120
Do you want to go and eat something with me?

583
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:04,360
Why do I have to go with you?

584
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,120
Why can’t you go with me?

585
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,840
Because I don’t want to.

586
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:12,480
Are you really not going with me?

587
00:32:13,280 --> 00:32:14,880
You must really be starving.

588
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:17,000
I can go back and eat at my house.

589
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:18,000
I’m going back with you then.

590
00:32:19,120 --> 00:32:20,600
What do you really want?

591
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:24,960
So?

592
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:26,160
Will you eat out with me?

593
00:32:26,800 --> 00:32:28,040
Or you want me to go with you to your home?

594
00:32:28,600 --> 00:32:29,560
I don’t mind that.

595
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:31,520
Err..

596
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:33,520
Fine! I’m going to eat out with you.

597
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,240
Move!

598
00:32:36,640 --> 00:32:37,800
Hurry and follow me!

599
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,040
See! it isn’t so hard? Isn’t it?

600
00:32:59,400 --> 00:32:59,880
Lin?

601
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,600
How is it?

602
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:02,880
Can you sleep here?

603
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,240
Or would you rather sleep at your condo?

604
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,720
It’s totally fine here.

605
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:09,040
I’m alright.

606
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,680
I don't want you to drive a car this late at night.

607
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:15,040
It’s dangerous.

608
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:17,360
You’re so thoughtful.

609
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:18,760
Always care about me.

610
00:33:20,280 --> 00:33:23,040
How’s your shirt? Comfy?

611
00:33:23,680 --> 00:33:24,680
Ahh.

612
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,960
It is a bit loose.

613
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:27,920
But..

614
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:29,240
Very comfy.

615
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:32,360
I think you look very cute in it.

616
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,040
Er..

617
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:50,600
Why don’t you put something on first?

618
00:33:52,400 --> 00:33:53,200
Why?

619
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:55,400
You’re afraid that you might not be able to stop yourself.

620
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:58,880
P’Sun!

621
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:05,440
You’re not really gonna wear any shirt.

622
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:09,800
I’m wearing one now.

623
00:34:18,239 --> 00:34:18,760
Lin

624
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:23,440
We..

625
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:27,360
Can we kiss?

626
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:00,440
Er…

627
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:03,400
Do you like it?

628
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:05,120
A kiss like this.

629
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:08,240
I really liked it.

630
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,320
It’s okay

631
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:13,000
but

632
00:36:14,720 --> 00:36:17,080
I’m not really sure.

633
00:36:18,280 --> 00:36:18,760
Well…

634
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,040
I have never kissed anyone before.

635
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:23,040
Then

636
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:29,840
If you want to try kissing

637
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,240
you can try it with me alright?

638
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:39,000
Stop it, that’s enough.

639
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,960
P’Sun, what are you doing?

640
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:48,560
Can I hug you like this?

641
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:50,720
P’Sun?

642
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:54,520
Can I keep hugging you like this?

643
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:57,320
It feels so good.

644
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:12,640
Lin!

645
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:14,960
Are you having a fever again?

646
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:15,960
Lin!

647
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:17,200
Lin!

648
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:18,200
Yes?

649
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,160
Are you okay?

650
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:21,880
You need to tell me.

651
00:38:22,520 --> 00:38:24,520
I’m well, it’s nothing.

652
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,680
I just had a very weird dream

653
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:30,800
so I feel like

654
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,920
I have a bad case of butterflies in my stomach.

655
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:38,800
It’s probably just because you’re not used to sleeping here.

656
00:38:41,080 --> 00:38:41,880
Alright?

657
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:43,800
I’m right here with you.

658
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:45,680
You don’t have to be scared of anything.

659
00:38:47,600 --> 00:38:48,560
P’Sun

660
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:54,680
Do you usually have a weird flower in your house?

661
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:57,520
I don’t think so?

662
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,080
Or it might be because I don’t really notice them.

663
00:39:02,200 --> 00:39:03,000
Why?

664
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:04,840
Something wrong?

665
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:06,280
Well..

666
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,440
That flower look the same

667
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:13,200
as the one in my dream.

668
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,720
Maybe because you’ve been working too much lately.

669
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:19,760
So..

670
00:39:19,760 --> 00:39:21,040
You might just have had a weird dream because of that.

671
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:23,840
It’s okay.

672
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,000
Just don’t think about it.

673
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:28,160
So..

674
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,000
Do you want to go back to sleep?

675
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,560
Maybe you should drink a bit of water.

676
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:44,160
Here you are.

677
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,960
Thank you so much.

678
00:39:49,360 --> 00:39:50,160
Don’t worry.

679
00:39:54,240 --> 00:39:55,040
Thank you.

680
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,520
Can you go back to sleep?

681
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:02,960
Yes

682
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,360
I’m going now.

683
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:39,960
The thought that we have to be apart

684
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:42,640
makes me miss you already.

685
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,480
I hope that this will cheer you up.

686
00:40:52,080 --> 00:40:53,040
So maybe you won’t miss me as much.

687
00:40:54,520 --> 00:40:55,320
You’re the cutest.

688
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:57,720
I’m going to work now.

689
00:40:58,760 --> 00:41:00,000
Can I hug you once more?

690
00:41:01,080 --> 00:41:01,880
Of course, you can.

691
00:41:03,680 --> 00:41:05,920
Is it really time for us to separate?

692
00:41:12,280 --> 00:41:13,200
P’Sun!

693
00:41:15,040 --> 00:41:15,480
Lin

694
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:21,720
Lin

695
00:41:24,800 --> 00:41:25,600
Lin!

696
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:33,600
I found it.

697
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,480
I found my phone.

698
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,440
Are you alright?

699
00:41:45,520 --> 00:41:46,200
Ops!

700
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
I’m sorry about that.

701
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:50,760
I didn’t mean to do that.

702
00:41:52,600 --> 00:41:53,440
I’m O.K.

703
00:41:55,080 --> 00:41:55,720
Er..

704
00:41:57,360 --> 00:41:58,840
Is there any more stuff you want to get down there?

705
00:42:00,640 --> 00:42:01,640
P’Sun!

706
00:42:02,200 --> 00:42:03,120
Stop teasing me!

707
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:04,680
I have to get to work now.

708
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,080
I’m going to be late now.

709
00:42:06,560 --> 00:42:07,000
Right.

710
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:07,800
Bye!

711
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:08,960
Good bye.

712
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:28,480
Wait!

713
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:30,720
There’s no one here yet?

714
00:42:47,440 --> 00:42:48,240
We knew!

715
00:42:48,240 --> 00:42:50,000
We found out already

716
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:50,880
who you were talking with.

717
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:53,520
You need to stop talking with him.

718
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:54,840
Because that guy

719
00:42:54,840 --> 00:42:56,200
is not only talking to you.

720
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,760
How did you two find out about who I’m talking with?

721
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:00,920
We saw!

722
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:02,440
You saw?

723
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,200
Yeah!

724
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:04,880
Why didn’t you tell us sooner

725
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,600
about who you’ve been talking with?

726
00:43:06,600 --> 00:43:07,040
Huh?

727
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:08,160
Uhm..

728
00:43:09,160 --> 00:43:09,800
I..

729
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:11,720
I..

730
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:14,400
I got scared.

731
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,000
I don’t want all of you

732
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,240
to misunderstand me.

733
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,760
Misunderstand?

734
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,360
Yeah.

735
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:21,280
And..

736
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:23,320
Did you two do it yet?

737
00:43:23,480 --> 00:43:24,160
No, not yet.

738
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:26,640
We haven’t even been in a committed relationship yet.

739
00:43:27,400 --> 00:43:28,080
Good!

740
00:43:28,560 --> 00:43:30,320
Because you have to stop talking to him.

741
00:43:31,600 --> 00:43:32,840
Stop it

742
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:35,240
Why? You don’t like him?

743
00:43:36,280 --> 00:43:38,080
You two don’t like

744
00:43:38,080 --> 00:43:40,640
P’

745
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:41,680
Su…

746
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:42,440
Look at this!

747
00:43:44,920 --> 00:43:46,000
Juladis

748
00:43:46,600 --> 00:43:48,080
and the secretary!

749
00:43:48,600 --> 00:43:51,360
We saw it with our own eyes. Isn’t that right Pim?

750
00:43:51,360 --> 00:43:51,960
Yes.

751
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:53,760
I feel like I can still remember everything.

752
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:54,840
Yes!

753
00:43:55,160 --> 00:43:57,240
You have to end it with that secretary.

754
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:58,360
Because

755
00:43:58,360 --> 00:44:00,000
he’s been cheating on you.

756
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:00,520
That’s right.

757
00:44:01,320 --> 00:44:02,240
No,

758
00:44:03,640 --> 00:44:05,200
he’s not the one that I’m talking with.

759
00:44:06,120 --> 00:44:06,920
What?

760
00:44:08,400 --> 00:44:09,280
He’s not?

761
00:44:10,160 --> 00:44:13,800
And why back then at the first aid room..

762
00:44:15,120 --> 00:44:16,160
You and him were….

763
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:17,920
When I’m really sure about him

764
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,000
I'll tell you guys right away.

765
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:25,000
Can’t you just tell us now anyways?

766
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,040
We’ll talk more about this after the meeting.

767
00:44:29,960 --> 00:44:31,160
It’s almost time for the meeting.

768
00:44:31,960 --> 00:44:33,200
Did you guys prepare all the documents?

769
00:44:35,840 --> 00:44:37,320
You’re all here?

770
00:44:37,320 --> 00:44:38,360
Hello,

771
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:41,080
Hello/Salin, today

772
00:44:41,080 --> 00:44:42,520
you are assigned to help Prim.

773
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:44,080
There is a lot of work to get done.

774
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:45,240
That’s alright.

775
00:44:59,520 --> 00:45:00,440
Hey!/P’Dulajis

776
00:45:00,760 --> 00:45:01,640
Juladis!

777
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:04,920
Are you two almost done with the work?

778
00:45:04,920 --> 00:45:05,840
What work?

779
00:45:06,200 --> 00:45:07,440
In your email! Check it out!

780
00:45:09,640 --> 00:45:10,520
P’Prim

781
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,760
Here are the documents that you asked for.

782
00:45:13,240 --> 00:45:14,240
Thanks!

783
00:45:21,960 --> 00:45:22,760
Yes?

784
00:45:23,840 --> 00:45:25,120
Okay, I will go and get it myself.

785
00:45:26,200 --> 00:45:27,000
Thank you.

786
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:31,400
Er..

787
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:33,800
Where are you heading?

788
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,800
Can I help you with anything?

789
00:45:36,400 --> 00:45:38,400
I think I have to go to Amaraporn's company.

790
00:45:38,720 --> 00:45:40,840
I have to go and get some documents myself. They have problems with their network.

791
00:45:41,120 --> 00:45:42,360
Do you want me to go there instead?

792
00:45:42,760 --> 00:45:45,720
So that you can continue with your work.

793
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:47,920
Can you take care of that please?

794
00:45:48,240 --> 00:45:50,080
But you have to be there before 3 p.m.

795
00:45:50,760 --> 00:45:52,560
That’s fine I’ll go now.

796
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:53,600
Thanks for the help.

797
00:45:53,600 --> 00:45:54,240
That’s okay.

798
00:45:55,560 --> 00:45:56,520
I’ll be right back.

799
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:57,760
Where are you going?

800
00:45:57,920 --> 00:45:58,680
I have to go get some documents.

801
00:46:07,600 --> 00:46:10,400
Why is the traffic so terrible today?

802
00:46:12,200 --> 00:46:13,440
How can I get there on time?

803
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:15,200
Thanks!

804
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:28,720
Are you going anywhere?

805
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:32,000
Yes, I am.

806
00:46:35,720 --> 00:46:37,360
The Amaraporn’s company.

807
00:46:37,600 --> 00:46:38,920
I have to get there before 3 P.M.

808
00:46:39,120 --> 00:46:40,120
You got that.

809
00:46:52,360 --> 00:46:54,440
Sorry but can you stop right here?

810
00:46:54,840 --> 00:46:55,560
What’s wrong?

811
00:46:55,960 --> 00:46:56,600
Er..

812
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:58,080
Can you go slower than this?

813
00:46:58,080 --> 00:47:00,440
If you have to make it before 3 P.M.

814
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:01,680
I have to ride at this speed.

815
00:47:02,640 --> 00:47:03,640
Hold tight! Okay?

816
00:47:15,680 --> 00:47:16,520
Keep the change.

817
00:47:18,080 --> 00:47:18,640
Hey!

818
00:47:19,840 --> 00:47:20,960
Give me back my helmet!

819
00:47:21,360 --> 00:47:22,960
Oh! I’m so sorry about that.

820
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:25,760
Sorry!

821
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:33,880
Sorry!

822
00:47:40,960 --> 00:47:42,320
Yes, P’Prim.

823
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:45,440
Yes, I have the documents with me now.

824
00:47:45,440 --> 00:47:46,880
I’m heading to the office right away.

825
00:47:47,800 --> 00:47:48,600
All right!

826
00:47:54,120 --> 00:47:56,280
There are so many people today!

827
00:48:06,440 --> 00:48:07,240
Here, I am.

828
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:35,400
I have allergy.

829
00:49:17,320 --> 00:49:21,280
Sam : Should we stop and eat something first. Yesterday, that seafood restaurant was quite good.

830
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:26,800
Sam : You can ask Pim and Lin to come with us.

831
00:49:35,440 --> 00:49:38,120
Yo : They can’t have seafood. They’re allergic to it.

832
00:49:38,120 --> 00:49:40,000
Sam : There’s only two of us then.

833
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:49,040
Yo?

834
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:50,400
So what should we do?

835
00:49:50,400 --> 00:49:51,560
Should we wait for Lin here?

836
00:49:51,720 --> 00:49:54,120
I guess. He'll probably be back soon.

837
00:49:54,320 --> 00:49:55,680
It’s getting late now.

838
00:49:56,280 --> 00:49:57,600
Is he going to be alright?

839
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:00,800
It’s probably just traffic.

840
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,000
And..

841
00:50:04,520 --> 00:50:05,400
Who are you talking with?

842
00:50:09,640 --> 00:50:10,440
No one,

843
00:50:11,160 --> 00:50:12,440
I’m scrolling.

844
00:50:12,920 --> 00:50:14,320
You’re just scrolling?

845
00:50:14,800 --> 00:50:16,280
But I saw that you were typing.

846
00:50:16,600 --> 00:50:18,000
I’m not!

847
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:18,640
What?

848
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:20,840
If you don’t believe me

849
00:50:20,840 --> 00:50:21,960
why do you even ask me about it?

850
00:50:22,360 --> 00:50:22,960
Huh?

851
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:31,440
Hello

852
00:50:34,040 --> 00:50:34,520
What?!

853
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:36,000
Lin is at the police station?

854
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:37,320
What?!/What?!

855
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,760
Alright, I’ll be there as soon as possible.

856
00:50:42,200 --> 00:50:43,480
What happened?

857
00:50:43,640 --> 00:50:44,400
I don’t know.

858
00:50:44,600 --> 00:50:46,480
I’ll call for a cab, okay?

859
00:50:47,200 --> 00:50:48,280
It’s too slow.

860
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:49,840
What should we do?

861
00:50:51,040 --> 00:50:52,040
At out place?

862
00:50:52,480 --> 00:50:53,800
O.k., O.k.

863
00:51:01,840 --> 00:51:02,800
We don’t need a car.

864
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,040
I have a good idea.

865
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:10,920
Hey,

866
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,560
Did you miss me, my boo?

867
00:51:13,680 --> 00:51:15,600
Why I can’t?

868
00:51:15,640 --> 00:51:18,160
We just met during lunch break.

869
00:51:19,040 --> 00:51:20,720
Be careful! Someone might see us.

870
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:24,480
Be more discreet! I don’t want anybody to see this.

871
00:51:25,560 --> 00:51:26,880
Here!/That’s enough!

872
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:27,680
P’Juladis!

873
00:51:28,120 --> 00:51:28,920
What!!

874
00:51:30,480 --> 00:51:31,720
What are you three doing here?

875
00:51:31,720 --> 00:51:34,800
You have to take us to the police station now.

876
00:51:34,800 --> 00:51:35,320
Huh?

877
00:51:35,840 --> 00:51:38,320
For what and why do I have to take you there?

878
00:51:39,920 --> 00:51:41,360
Oh! I think..

879
00:51:42,200 --> 00:51:43,560
I really think you should take us there.

880
00:51:47,080 --> 00:51:47,880
Hey!

881
00:51:51,240 --> 00:51:53,280
If you don’t want me to leak this video

882
00:51:53,920 --> 00:51:55,440
then you have to do as we said.

883
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:57,280
What are you going to do now?

884
00:51:58,200 --> 00:51:59,040
I think…

885
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:00,680
If this video got leaked

886
00:52:01,080 --> 00:52:02,480
it may affect your work.

887
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:06,800
Because you’re supposed to work but you take the time to make love instead.

888
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:09,520
That’s so wrong.

889
00:52:10,200 --> 00:52:11,080
So what is it then?

890
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:12,520
Will you take us there or not?

891
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:14,680
Fine, I will.

892
00:52:14,680 --> 00:52:15,640
You need to hurry now.

893
00:52:15,800 --> 00:52:16,080
Let’s go.

894
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:16,280
Let’s go.

895
00:52:16,280 --> 00:52:16,840
Let's get going, Yo.

896
00:52:16,840 --> 00:52:17,480
Come on, hurry.

897
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:18,320
Fast!

898
00:52:19,000 --> 00:52:19,800
See!

899
00:52:20,320 --> 00:52:23,160
Didn’t I tell you so?

900
00:52:24,120 --> 00:52:25,320
It has become a problem now.

901
00:52:33,240 --> 00:52:34,000
Lin!/Lin!

902
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:34,640
Lin!

903
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:36,720
Did you get hurt?

904
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:38,720
Can I see you? Where did you get hurt?

905
00:52:39,240 --> 00:52:39,640
Hurry!

906
00:52:39,640 --> 00:52:40,160
Lin!

907
00:52:40,760 --> 00:52:41,440
Guys!

908
00:52:42,320 --> 00:52:43,200
Calm down!

909
00:52:43,680 --> 00:52:44,960
I’m fine.

910
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,080
I didn’t get hurt anywhere.

911
00:52:47,320 --> 00:52:48,480
It's good that you’re fine.

912
00:52:49,360 --> 00:52:50,880
But let me see, who did this to you?

913
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,760
Yo! stay calm!

914
00:52:58,960 --> 00:52:59,680
Ouch!

915
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,240
I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to do that.

916
00:53:05,240 --> 00:53:05,840
Really?

917
00:53:06,080 --> 00:53:08,480
You didn’t mean to? You just assaulted me.

918
00:53:09,040 --> 00:53:10,680
Well, you touch my butt first.

919
00:53:11,320 --> 00:53:12,920
I’m just trying to protect myself.

920
00:53:13,480 --> 00:53:14,160
Don’t trust him!

921
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:16,560
Are you insane? Me touching your ass?

922
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,000
Do you want to get hurt or what?

923
00:53:19,840 --> 00:53:21,280
I was a gangster, You know?

924
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,560
You’ll regret this.

925
00:53:36,080 --> 00:53:37,400
I will beat you up!

926
00:53:55,080 --> 00:53:56,160
I’m sorry.

927
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:57,680
Really sorry.

928
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:00,680
From now on I will not do this to anyone anymore.

929
00:54:01,120 --> 00:54:01,800
Good!

930
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:03,600
You

931
00:54:05,600 --> 00:54:06,400
Wait!

932
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:08,640
I can't let you go just yet.

933
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,400
You have to go to the police station with me.

934
00:54:11,120 --> 00:54:13,000
You have to make sure that you won’t do this ever again.

935
00:54:13,000 --> 00:54:14,000
Okay!

936
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:15,280
But before I go to the police station,

937
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,160
can you take me to the hospital first?

938
00:54:20,520 --> 00:54:21,000
Get up!

939
00:54:21,000 --> 00:54:21,640
Okay!

940
00:54:23,120 --> 00:54:23,480
Get up!

941
00:54:23,480 --> 00:54:23,920
Alright!

942
00:54:24,280 --> 00:54:25,080
Okay!

943
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:29,040
Follow me!

944
00:54:29,040 --> 00:54:29,400
Copy that!

945
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:31,400
Which hand did I touch you with?

946
00:54:31,840 --> 00:54:32,440
Here!

947
00:54:34,480 --> 00:54:35,280
A mess!

948
00:54:36,160 --> 00:54:37,560
Is he also on drug?

949
00:54:37,800 --> 00:54:39,440
He’s speculating!/Hey, Yo!

950
00:54:39,440 --> 00:54:40,200
You have to charge him.

951
00:54:40,200 --> 00:54:41,240
He looks really bad.

952
00:54:42,560 --> 00:54:43,840
He deserved this.

953
00:54:44,680 --> 00:54:45,920
Please take care of this.

954
00:54:46,360 --> 00:54:48,440
If this happens again you have to take care of him.

955
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,160
I won’t press any charges this time.

956
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:55,360
Didn’t think that your black belt Taekwondo will be useful.

957
00:54:55,720 --> 00:54:58,160
I didn’t think that a person your size

958
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,480
could hurt him that bad.

959
00:55:00,680 --> 00:55:02,560
I didn’t want to hurt anyone.

960
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:04,440
All I want to do is protect myself.

961
00:55:04,760 --> 00:55:06,720
You did the right thing.

962
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,920
I really think he deserved that.

963
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,280
You beated him up so bad.

964
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,800
Thank you, all of you for coming.

965
00:55:14,440 --> 00:55:15,840
Thanks to you as well, P’ Juladis.

966
00:55:16,200 --> 00:55:17,240
No worries!

967
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:21,800
Uhm.. Without us..

968
00:55:22,200 --> 00:55:23,680
Who would take care of you?

969
00:55:24,360 --> 00:55:25,120
Right?

970
00:55:25,200 --> 00:55:25,960
Yeah!

971
00:55:26,280 --> 00:55:28,280
Will you tell The person that you’re talking with about this?

972
00:55:29,480 --> 00:55:30,200
Let’s go.

973
00:55:30,440 --> 00:55:31,360
Wait!

974
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:34,200
Just a moment,

975
00:55:34,200 --> 00:55:35,400
I’ll be back.

976
00:55:36,040 --> 00:55:38,200
I need to use a toilet.

977
00:55:38,440 --> 00:55:40,440
We’re all going to the toilet then.

978
00:55:40,760 --> 00:55:41,520
Go, go, go.

979
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:43,160
See you down there.

980
00:55:43,160 --> 00:55:43,560
Okay!

981
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:44,440
Let’s go.

982
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:46,680
Sam, I have a stomachache. Let’s go.

983
00:55:46,680 --> 00:55:47,080
What?

984
00:55:47,080 --> 00:55:47,760
I can’t hold it in anymore.

985
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:04,360
Are you alright?

986
00:56:04,600 --> 00:56:05,680
Did you get hurt anywhere?

987
00:56:06,080 --> 00:56:07,160
You need to tell me, alright?

988
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:08,120
Where?

989
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,560
I’m totally fine.

990
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:13,360
Your face is getting all red now.

991
00:57:09,000 --> 00:57:09,680
What?

992
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:11,360
The president is..

993
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:13,720
the one in the app?

994
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:16,440
P’Prim, can you help me with this?

995
00:57:17,920 --> 00:57:19,880
You drew this picture yourself?

996
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:21,040
Yes, I drew that myself.

997
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,440
Does this mean that you like the sunset?

998
00:57:24,440 --> 00:57:26,200
I think you’re the one for me.

999
00:57:26,440 --> 00:57:28,200
I can’t wait any longer.
