1
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:11,640
I didn’t really do that.

2
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,320
Do you believe me?

3
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:14,560
I need your help.

4
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:16,200
Is she the fiancé of the president?

5
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:17,320
I’ll be counting for that day.

6
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:21,320
I’ll give Soul high jewelry another chance.

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:26,600
Under one condition which is Salin has to be a model for me.

8
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:30,000
He’s just our new intern.

9
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,439
An intern? Follow Mom to the president room now.

10
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:36,680
Can you stop disturbing me while I’m working?

11
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:38,280
Act like a grown up!

12
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,640
Thank you for dropping me off here.

13
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:56,240
Why are you unbuckling your safety belt?

14
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:59,280
Well, I’m not here just to drop you off

15
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,400
but I’m here to take care of you for the whole day.

16
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:06,640
Khun Dan! I told you that I’m fine by myself.

17
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:08,320
You don’t have to worry about me.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,640
Another thing is if you go inside, other people might find out about us.

19
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,640
It wouldn’t look good for the both of us.

20
00:01:15,440 --> 00:01:17,480
Actually, this is my job too,

21
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,039
I have to look after the jewelry as well.

22
00:01:21,039 --> 00:01:23,560
In case something bad happens

23
00:01:23,720 --> 00:01:26,360
I’m here to solve the problem right away.

24
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,320
Is that okay with you?

25
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,400
I guess it’s okay then.

26
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:35,600
There’s another thing that I haven’t cleared the air with you just yet.

27
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:37,880
What is it?

28
00:01:39,039 --> 00:01:42,600
You didn’t tell me that Sam is your brother.

29
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,320
I’m upset with you.

30
00:01:46,600 --> 00:01:47,680
I’m so sorry about that.

31
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:50,320
I just haven’t got a chance to tell you yet.

32
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,000
But honestly, I want Sam to be the one to tell you about that.

33
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:01,560
Can you believe me please? Please?

34
00:02:02,160 --> 00:02:05,840
Fine, the benefit of doubt shall be given to the defendant this time.

35
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,600
If something like this happens again, I won’t let you go this easy.

36
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
Uhm.. One more thing,

37
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:17,920
if you’re here to work with me today.

38
00:02:18,280 --> 00:02:23,360
Can I ask you for one thing? That is, you have to act normal.

39
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,720
I don’t want anybody to find out about us.

40
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,640
But…

41
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,880
Does this mean I can do things with you now? Since we haven’t started working yet.

42
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:36,880
Khun Dad!

43
00:02:38,079 --> 00:02:41,360
You can’t! There are so many people walking around.

44
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:43,680
You will blow out our secret.

45
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,640
That’s fine with me.

46
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:50,000
Khun Dad!

47
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,240
You are really going to expose our relationship.

48
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:55,160
Let’s just get to work already.

49
00:02:57,120 --> 00:02:57,640
I’ll get the door for you.

50
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:02,920
No, you don’t really have to. Just open your door.

51
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:04,160
I can do that myself.

52
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:05,160
I’m going now.

53
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:12,040
Khun Dad! You’re so stubborn!

54
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,240
I’m leaving now.

55
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,040
Your skin is so good.

56
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:36,040
President,

57
00:03:36,600 --> 00:03:39,320
if you keep staring like that, everyone won’t be able to do their job.

58
00:03:39,880 --> 00:03:41,040
Uh. Really?

59
00:03:41,720 --> 00:03:44,240
I’m sorry about that I didn’t mean to do that.

60
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:48,600
Don’t worry. Salin already has perfect skin and a beautiful feature.

61
00:03:48,880 --> 00:03:50,560
I don’t need to do much.

62
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:52,480
That is so true.

63
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:01,800
Good morning.

64
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:02,840
Good morning to you too.

65
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,880
How is it? Is everything fine?

66
00:04:06,080 --> 00:04:06,960
It’s all fine.

67
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:07,880
Okay.

68
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:19,000
Excuse-me, why do we have night jasmine flowers here?

69
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,400
Ah, the crew said that we have to use them in the photoshoot.

70
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:25,520
You have to hold them.

71
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:27,440
Right.

72
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:41,360
The same…

73
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:43,600
It looks the same.

74
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:45,120
Hello. Madame.

75
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:46,040
Hello.

76
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:51,560
Lin?

77
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,440
Good morning.

78
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,280
Hello.

79
00:05:56,040 --> 00:05:58,800
You came to the photoshoot yourself?

80
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:02,600
I want to see Salin models with my own eyes.

81
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:04,240
I’m so sure

82
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,560
that Salin will make our 50th anniversary of Amaraporn group as flawless as he could.

83
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:18,720
I think we should try the necklace on.

84
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,600
Yes.

85
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,840
This looks exactly like what I imagined.

86
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,000
What do you think, Suriyen?

87
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,360
It’s perfect.

88
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,560
But I didn’t know that Nu-Lin has such a sweet feature.

89
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:15,480
He looks so powerful with the jewelry on.

90
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,720
You’re right.

91
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:18,880
Salin, are you ready?

92
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:19,960
Ready?

93
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:21,720
Come on in.

94
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,440
Smile.

95
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,200
Tilt your head up a bit.

96
00:07:33,159 --> 00:07:35,520
Why don’t you change your posture more? Try sitting

97
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:10,760
Nice!

98
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,360
Good!

99
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,760
I like this one.

100
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:41,559
I really like this one also.

101
00:08:41,679 --> 00:08:45,360
In this angle, can you take another one that zooms in closer?

102
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:47,520
Just like that.

103
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:49,240
Okay.

104
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:02,040
Salin.

105
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:05,960
Salin!

106
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:08,840
Salin.

107
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,200
Lin!

108
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:23,960
Lin!

109
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:25,800
Lin!

110
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:02,920
Doctor!

111
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:04,560
How is Lin holding up?

112
00:10:04,840 --> 00:10:05,840
The patient…

113
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,200
is out of the woods now.

114
00:10:11,960 --> 00:10:12,760
But still…

115
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:16,760
What is it?

116
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:28,800
I already sent it to you for a while now.

117
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:37,120
All Yo did was talking about food.

118
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:37,920
Alright.

119
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:40,560
I’ll buy for you. I’ll buy a lot for you.

120
00:10:45,480 --> 00:10:46,800
Okay, I have to go now.

121
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:06,840
Hello, Darling.

122
00:11:06,960 --> 00:11:08,440
How are you doing, my love?

123
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:11,160
What are you doing?

124
00:11:11,960 --> 00:11:14,360
Should we go and grab something to eat together today?

125
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,520
I’m sorry but I have classes.

126
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:20,680
I don’t think I’ll be able to go out with you today.

127
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:24,520
That’s a shame.

128
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,600
Right, I miss you so much. I’ll find some time to go see you.

129
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:34,840
How about I go to see you instead?

130
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,080
That’d be great.

131
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:40,440
But don’t you have to intern.

132
00:11:42,520 --> 00:11:44,120
Please don’t get my hopes up like that.

133
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:47,840
Alright, I won’t take more of your time.

134
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,040
Take care okay? Keep working hard. I’m rooting for you.

135
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,160
How can a person be this lucky?

136
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:03,680
I have such a cute and caring boyfriend.

137
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:14,880
Darling!

138
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:17,520
How long have you been waiting for me?

139
00:12:17,520 --> 00:12:18,560
Not that long.

140
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:21,240
I can wait for you all day.

141
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:26,000
Do you want to dine in my room today?

142
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:28,480
Okay, can we go now?

143
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,000
Let’s go.

144
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,640
Yeah, let’s go.

145
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:32,320
Pim.

146
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:38,160
How long?

147
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:41,000
Erm…

148
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:45,800
Why have I only been dating the bad ones?

149
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:51,960
I should be the one who said that.

150
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:57,200
You never wanted to do it with me.

151
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,040
Do what?

152
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,200
We’ve been together for a very long time.

153
00:13:04,440 --> 00:13:06,680
But you never wanted to sleep with me once.

154
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,720
How can I be with you anymore?

155
00:13:12,040 --> 00:13:13,120
Let’s just go Cherry.

156
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:23,880
I forgot to tell you one thing.

157
00:13:23,880 --> 00:13:26,600
I don’t want Cherry to misunderstand that we’re still together.

158
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,360
We’re over now.

159
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:02,280
Why are you crying? You’re not a child anymore.

160
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,480
P’Prim..

161
00:14:08,760 --> 00:14:11,600
You’re here all wailing because you can’t handle the work.

162
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,200
That Is not the reason.

163
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:16,960
I’m crying because I just broke up with my boyfriend.

164
00:14:19,320 --> 00:14:21,280
Okay, then..

165
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,120
What is it? You can vent to me.

166
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,080
What an evil person!

167
00:15:50,120 --> 00:15:51,040
Hey!

168
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:52,800
Mr. Sam!

169
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:56,800
You have your own toilet. Why are you stealing mine?

170
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:59,240
And why won’t you talk to me?

171
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:03,520
That is really your reason why you’re stealing my toilet.

172
00:16:05,160 --> 00:16:05,960
Yo,

173
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:08,800
Can I be your Sam like I used to?

174
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:21,320
Who’s calling now?

175
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:24,680
What is it?

176
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,200
What!?

177
00:16:27,320 --> 00:16:28,440
And where is Lin now?

178
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:38,160
President! How is Lin doing?

179
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,160
The doctor told me that

180
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,280
he’s fine.

181
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:49,680
But he won’t wake up.

182
00:16:52,320 --> 00:16:54,160
What happened to him exactly?

183
00:16:58,240 --> 00:16:59,040
Er…

184
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,040
It might sound a bit bizarre.

185
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,560
Lin!

186
00:17:55,710 --> 00:17:58,910
The thing that you saw when you were helping Lin in the water.

187
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:00,750
Was that…

188
00:18:02,350 --> 00:18:03,430
a naga?

189
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:06,070
That’s right!

190
00:18:06,950 --> 00:18:10,590
Lin has told me about his dream before that he saw Naga in his dream before.

191
00:18:11,190 --> 00:18:14,990
And also a guy wearing an old traditional costume.

192
00:18:15,670 --> 00:18:16,790
Wait?

193
00:18:17,870 --> 00:18:19,830
He dreamed about a man wearing a traditional costume before.

194
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:20,870
That’s right.

195
00:18:21,630 --> 00:18:23,070
Lin told me that

196
00:18:23,950 --> 00:18:26,790
he dreamed about that man very often.

197
00:18:27,270 --> 00:18:30,470
He told me that he’s been having the same dream since he was a kid.

198
00:18:31,150 --> 00:18:35,910
He told me that he has a dream about a woman.

199
00:18:37,190 --> 00:18:38,630
A woman wearing a traditional dress called for him.

200
00:18:39,710 --> 00:18:41,270
But I’ve never heard about a man.

201
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,430
Can you pass this along?

202
00:18:53,630 --> 00:18:54,470
Here you go, P’Juladis.

203
00:18:56,190 --> 00:18:58,830
You told me yourself that you’re willing to help in every way.

204
00:19:02,550 --> 00:19:03,350
just take this.

205
00:19:10,590 --> 00:19:13,630
Since the doctor couldn’t really tell what is wrong with Lin

206
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:18,950
and we don’t know when he is going to be awake.

207
00:19:22,750 --> 00:19:23,550
If it can’t be be achieved by trickery,

208
00:19:24,590 --> 00:19:25,390
then use strategy.

209
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:31,030
if it can't be done with spells, then use incantations.

210
00:19:47,750 --> 00:19:49,390
We just have to rely on superstition now.

211
00:19:50,510 --> 00:19:51,310
Just praying that you wish for Lin to have a speedy recovery.

212
00:19:54,590 --> 00:19:56,750
Everyone please focus on your prayer and chant.

213
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:09,430
What is the relationship between the president and Salin?

214
00:20:12,270 --> 00:20:13,070
I don’t know.

215
00:20:13,870 --> 00:20:14,990
I really don’t know.

216
00:20:15,750 --> 00:20:17,550
What is it between them?

217
00:20:18,310 --> 00:20:19,870
I can swear now.

218
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:23,910
I’m swearing now that I really don’

219
00:20:39,190 --> 00:20:41,030
Did you already drop your friend off?

220
00:20:41,430 --> 00:20:44,430
Yes, I did.

221
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,630
I’m going to be here for you today.

222
00:20:47,630 --> 00:20:48,870
That’s totally fine.

223
00:20:48,870 --> 00:20:49,710
Come on, please.

224
00:20:50,870 --> 00:20:51,910
You can just go home and sleep at home.

225
00:20:52,270 --> 00:20:53,350
It’s not that comfortable here.

226
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:55,670
I’m sorry to interrupt.

227
00:20:56,710 --> 00:20:58,110
I’m here to inform you about Qatar.

228
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:00,310
You can say.

229
00:21:02,750 --> 00:21:04,110
He knows about that.

230
00:21:04,470 --> 00:21:05,430
Alright.

231
00:21:05,430 --> 00:21:10,790
Mr. Mustafa, our partner from Qatar, has accepted our meeting.

232
00:21:11,310 --> 00:21:14,430
But you have to fly to Qatar tomorrow.

233
00:21:17,110 --> 00:21:18,670
It can’t be rescheduled right?

234
00:21:19,470 --> 00:21:24,270
If you want to reschedule this meeting, he might be free again next months

235
00:21:24,270 --> 00:21:27,110
since he has his business trip in France.

236
00:21:36,830 --> 00:21:37,630
Bro,

237
00:21:38,390 --> 00:21:39,590
I can go there for you.

238
00:22:25,070 --> 00:22:25,870
You’re awake now?

239
00:22:26,710 --> 00:22:27,510
Salin.

240
00:22:38,710 --> 00:22:39,510
It’s you again.

241
00:22:41,190 --> 00:22:41,990
Who are you?

242
00:22:42,950 --> 00:22:43,750
Me?

243
00:22:46,470 --> 00:22:50,310
I am called Sidarin.

244
00:22:51,350 --> 00:22:53,030
Don’t ever run away from me again.

245
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,710
What do you want from me?

246
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:57,590
Why do you keep appearing in my dream?

247
00:22:57,670 --> 00:22:59,270
And why did you take me here?

248
00:23:00,230 --> 00:23:01,950
I want to go back where I belong.

249
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:04,750
Here is the realm of your soul.

250
00:23:06,710 --> 00:23:07,510
The realm of my soul?

251
00:23:09,830 --> 00:23:10,630
Yes.

252
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:12,990
Doest this mean

253
00:23:14,470 --> 00:23:15,390
I am dead?

254
00:23:18,550 --> 00:23:22,150
No, you’re still alive.

255
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:27,430
The fact that I brought you here

256
00:23:30,110 --> 00:23:32,230
is because I need your help.

257
00:23:34,270 --> 00:23:35,950
Because there’s only you

258
00:23:37,950 --> 00:23:39,790
who can help me.

259
00:23:44,950 --> 00:23:46,310
What can I help you with?

260
00:23:48,430 --> 00:23:49,910
I will tell you everything.

261
00:23:51,510 --> 00:23:53,310
All you have to do is follow me.

262
00:24:26,190 --> 00:24:27,270
You’re still not awake, Lin?

263
00:24:29,390 --> 00:24:30,190
It’s time to wake up now.

264
00:24:34,390 --> 00:24:35,270
Doctor,

265
00:24:37,230 --> 00:24:38,470
when is he going to wake up?

266
00:24:39,950 --> 00:24:41,750
I can’t really answer that.

267
00:24:43,750 --> 00:24:45,910
Because all of his numbers seem normal,

268
00:24:46,670 --> 00:24:50,590
whether his blood pressure, his vital sign or even his breathing.

269
00:24:52,710 --> 00:24:54,590
It really depends on the patient now.

270
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,710
When he’s ready, he will wake up.

271
00:24:59,630 --> 00:25:00,630
You need to sign this.

272
00:25:04,270 --> 00:25:05,070
Thank you so much Chan.

273
00:25:10,390 --> 00:25:11,430
During the period that I’m absent from the company,

274
00:25:12,670 --> 00:25:13,670
please take care of it.

275
00:25:14,790 --> 00:25:18,150
If you’re tired I can take care of him for you.

276
00:25:18,670 --> 00:25:19,870
That’s fine.

277
00:25:20,550 --> 00:25:21,790
You better get back to work.

278
00:26:01,950 --> 00:26:02,990
Good night.

279
00:26:08,990 --> 00:26:10,470
I hope we’ll be waking up at the same time tomorrow.

280
00:26:30,550 --> 00:26:33,430
This is where you wanted to take me to?

281
00:26:35,110 --> 00:26:35,750
Yes,

282
00:26:37,110 --> 00:26:37,990
this is the cave.

283
00:26:39,550 --> 00:26:41,470
It’s where I’ve been living for many centuries now.

284
00:26:43,550 --> 00:26:45,230
What brought you here?

285
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:50,710
If you wish to know then must you follow.

286
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,350
Why don’t you gaze at the water with your hand?

287
00:27:09,190 --> 00:27:10,710
And you shall know the truth.

288
00:28:06,430 --> 00:28:07,750
What happened to my son?

289
00:28:12,550 --> 00:28:13,990
There was an accident

290
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:16,990
that caused Lin to pass out.

291
00:28:21,030 --> 00:28:24,350
Didn’t you promise me to take care of him very well?

292
00:28:26,710 --> 00:28:27,870
You’re a man.

293
00:28:30,630 --> 00:28:32,230
You have to be able to keep your words!

294
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,590
Or don’t say anything at all.

295
00:28:38,510 --> 00:28:39,310
I’m sorry.

296
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:40,950
Enough! I don’t want to hear from you anymore.

297
00:28:42,710 --> 00:28:44,910
Can I have some private time with my son?

298
00:28:52,230 --> 00:28:53,990
Why are you still here? Get out!

299
00:28:55,790 --> 00:28:56,190
Right.

300
00:29:13,990 --> 00:29:14,390
Lin,

301
00:29:15,110 --> 00:29:16,030
are you okay?

302
00:29:20,390 --> 00:29:21,950
Can you wake up and talk to me?

303
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,430
I’m scared. So scared to lose you.

304
00:30:11,510 --> 00:30:13,430
You should go back to where you belong, Sasikarn.

305
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,670
I don’t want to be engaged with him.

306
00:30:22,390 --> 00:30:23,870
What have you done, Sidarin?

307
00:30:24,870 --> 00:30:25,670
Sasikarn?

308
00:30:28,030 --> 00:30:29,950
You’ve killed your own sister, Sidarin.

309
00:30:30,430 --> 00:30:31,190
How could you perform such an act?

310
00:30:32,070 --> 00:30:33,070
You are in love with her.

311
00:30:33,670 --> 00:30:34,950
She has your whole heart.

312
00:30:35,230 --> 00:30:37,790
Even though she heartlessly denied your feelings.

313
00:30:38,550 --> 00:30:41,430
What shall I do to make you love me?

314
00:30:44,270 --> 00:30:45,230
Your necklace!

315
00:30:45,710 --> 00:30:46,790
You must take it back now.

316
00:30:48,270 --> 00:30:49,230
Because all of your stuffs

317
00:30:51,150 --> 00:30:52,430
are all so pathetic.

318
00:30:56,790 --> 00:30:57,230
Ouch!

319
00:30:58,230 --> 00:30:59,030
My love!

320
00:31:00,350 --> 00:31:01,150
My love!

321
00:32:11,150 --> 00:32:12,550
Tell him that I’ll be there as soon as possible.

322
00:32:12,990 --> 00:32:14,910
You have to prepare all of the important documents for me.

323
00:33:06,670 --> 00:33:07,870
You have to wake up now, Lin.

324
00:33:11,310 --> 00:33:12,950
You’ve been sleeping for far too long.

325
00:33:20,790 --> 00:33:21,950
I miss you.

326
00:33:26,310 --> 00:33:28,070
It’s so quiet at my home.

327
00:33:33,510 --> 00:33:35,030
Can you wake up and talk to me?

328
00:33:38,950 --> 00:33:40,230
No matter what happens,

329
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,270
I’ll be right here waiting for you.

330
00:34:05,950 --> 00:34:06,670
Your love?

331
00:34:07,670 --> 00:34:08,870
Who is your love?

332
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:14,949
That person that you have met,

333
00:34:16,190 --> 00:34:17,909
his name is called Lord Phraya Suriyen.

334
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,270
Lord Phraya Suriyen?

335
00:34:24,429 --> 00:34:26,790
After the incident I’ve been practicing asceticism

336
00:34:28,510 --> 00:34:30,790
and reminding myself of what I did wrong.

337
00:34:32,989 --> 00:34:34,870
Centuries that I’ve been here

338
00:34:36,310 --> 00:34:38,550
there’s only you that can save me.

339
00:34:39,429 --> 00:34:41,750
Because if I’m still holding on to something

340
00:34:42,670 --> 00:34:44,350
that I can’t let go just yet,

341
00:34:45,469 --> 00:34:46,830
You must be in the same position as

342
00:34:48,870 --> 00:34:51,230
because I will still be hanging around with you.

343
00:34:55,030 --> 00:34:56,590
What do you mean by that?

344
00:35:01,310 --> 00:35:03,670
Don’t you feel anything, Salin?

345
00:35:06,430 --> 00:35:09,950
For all the time that I’ve been trapping here,

346
00:35:12,070 --> 00:35:13,910
I’ve finished practicing asceticism.

347
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:21,590
I have prayed to be reborn in a new realm to liberate me.

348
00:35:25,230 --> 00:35:27,310
You’re are my soul.

349
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:30,470
Salin.

350
00:36:15,470 --> 00:36:15,950
Lin!

351
00:36:17,110 --> 00:36:17,510
Lin!

352
00:36:23,550 --> 00:36:24,470
How are you?

353
00:36:28,110 --> 00:36:29,910
Why are you crying?

354
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,830
You have to lie down still.

355
00:36:38,670 --> 00:36:39,590
Do you feel any pain?

356
00:36:40,230 --> 00:36:41,270
I’ll go get you a doctor.

357
00:36:49,190 --> 00:36:50,190
I’m fine.

358
00:36:52,030 --> 00:36:53,110
Totally fine.

359
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:58,990
Er…

360
00:37:03,350 --> 00:37:04,390
It was like I…

361
00:37:06,110 --> 00:37:07,750
I was trapped in my dream.

362
00:37:10,270 --> 00:37:12,190
It was such a long dream.

363
00:37:28,830 --> 00:37:29,350
This…

364
00:37:32,270 --> 00:37:33,310
This is a naga.

365
00:37:35,590 --> 00:37:36,150
You’re right.

366
00:37:38,510 --> 00:37:39,430
This belongs to my mom.

367
00:37:42,750 --> 00:37:44,590
I put it for you as a protective charm.

368
00:37:46,510 --> 00:37:48,630
There is also a naga in my dream.

369
00:37:50,430 --> 00:37:51,230
In my dream,

370
00:37:54,630 --> 00:37:56,790
I was in a  very wet cave

371
00:37:59,670 --> 00:38:01,870
where there is a naga that got imprisoned there.

372
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,470
And I actually felt like I was imprisoned there as well.

373
00:38:07,830 --> 00:38:14,710
She was imprisoned by the naga whose name is Suriyen.

374
00:38:16,350 --> 00:38:17,590
He has the same name as you.

375
00:38:19,310 --> 00:38:23,230
This might sound ridiculous to you right?

376
00:38:27,870 --> 00:38:28,630
I do believe you.

377
00:38:29,550 --> 00:38:30,390
Really?

378
00:38:31,430 --> 00:38:32,430
Because I saw one too.

379
00:38:33,030 --> 00:38:34,350
You saw one too?

380
00:38:34,830 --> 00:38:37,230
And when you saw..Lin!

381
00:38:38,310 --> 00:38:39,110
You should rest first.

382
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:43,550
I don’t want you to get worse.

383
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:49,270
Stop thinking and rest, okay?.

384
00:38:51,310 --> 00:38:52,750
I’ll go get a nurse.

385
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:26,710
I want this now!

386
00:39:30,150 --> 00:39:31,030
Lin is awake now!

387
00:39:45,190 --> 00:39:46,670
After you get out of the hospital tomorrow.

388
00:39:47,430 --> 00:39:48,710
Please, come back to our home, alright?

389
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:53,470
Er…

390
00:39:53,790 --> 00:39:55,790
I haven’t finished with my internship yet.

391
00:39:57,110 --> 00:40:00,510
If the internship has put you in this condition,

392
00:40:01,070 --> 00:40:02,030
I won’t allow you to do that anymore.

393
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,750
I’m not a kid anymore.

394
00:40:08,750 --> 00:40:10,070
You can’t tell me what to do.

395
00:40:15,190 --> 00:40:16,150
Don’t be too stubborn with me?

396
00:40:17,230 --> 00:40:19,990
Or is this because of him

397
00:40:20,550 --> 00:40:21,590
who put you in this situation?

398
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:25,670
It’s not because of him.

399
00:40:27,350 --> 00:40:28,030
But…

400
00:40:29,710 --> 00:40:33,030
This internship is really important to me

401
00:40:34,190 --> 00:40:35,910
but, once I’m done with this.

402
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:39,470
I promise that I’ll go back to you immediately.

403
00:40:41,590 --> 00:40:43,310
Please? Please?

404
00:40:47,230 --> 00:40:47,990
Can I please?

405
00:40:52,150 --> 00:40:54,950
Promise me that once you’re done,

406
00:40:55,550 --> 00:40:57,270
you have to come home with me.

407
00:40:57,630 --> 00:40:58,590
Alright, I promise!

408
00:40:58,870 --> 00:41:00,550
I love you the most.

409
00:41:01,470 --> 00:41:04,670
I really do have the best dad ever!

410
00:41:07,390 --> 00:41:10,910
I swear that I’ll get my project done quickly so that I can get back home with you.

411
00:41:28,910 --> 00:41:30,390
You’re late.

412
00:41:31,070 --> 00:41:33,910
You should not let a woman wait for you this long.

413
00:41:36,670 --> 00:41:38,230
Actually, I’m here 2 minutes early.

414
00:41:42,470 --> 00:41:43,910
Can we take a selfie?

415
00:42:12,070 --> 00:42:13,030
Son!

416
00:42:13,670 --> 00:42:17,590
You need to tell me. What if you fall down or something.

417
00:42:18,070 --> 00:42:19,430
I’m all stronger now.

418
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,030
What a headstrong kid.

419
00:42:23,230 --> 00:42:27,710
Lin! Oh! Dad, hello/ Hello, Dad.

420
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:34,390
Look! I brought your favorite snack.

421
00:42:34,550 --> 00:42:38,150
But I already ate some of it, I hope you don’t mind that.

422
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,590
Dad!

423
00:42:40,590 --> 00:42:41,750
What is it, son?

424
00:42:41,750 --> 00:42:43,470
Yo is teasing me again.

425
00:42:45,310 --> 00:42:47,270
That’s good. I want you to have some company over.

426
00:42:47,670 --> 00:42:48,550
How about this?

427
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:52,350
I’ll let all of you keep teasing each other and I’ll be back again later, okay?

428
00:42:52,750 --> 00:42:53,310
Thanks.

429
00:42:53,310 --> 00:42:53,790
Okay.

430
00:42:53,790 --> 00:42:56,550
I’ll be in charge of Lin.

431
00:42:56,830 --> 00:42:59,470
I’ll be sure that not a hair out of place.

432
00:43:00,390 --> 00:43:01,110
Thank you so much.

433
00:43:01,110 --> 00:43:02,030
We got you.

434
00:43:03,790 --> 00:43:04,710
Wow! Even though you’re sick,

435
00:43:05,110 --> 00:43:08,630
why are you looking so fresh?

436
00:43:08,910 --> 00:43:10,390
You know when you were not here,

437
00:43:10,750 --> 00:43:13,030
I really missed you.

438
00:43:13,030 --> 00:43:13,830
Really?

439
00:43:13,830 --> 00:43:14,670
Yes.

440
00:43:16,430 --> 00:43:17,270
Miss you.

441
00:43:19,750 --> 00:43:21,230
Thanks for coming.

442
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:25,270
But I can’t eat that just yet.

443
00:43:25,630 --> 00:43:26,270
Why is that?

444
00:43:26,270 --> 00:43:27,870
The doctor told me to eat something soft first.

445
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,030
I'll eat that myself then.

446
00:43:30,630 --> 00:43:31,390
Fine.

447
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:36,350
Where is the president? Is he not here?

448
00:43:37,270 --> 00:43:37,990
P’Sun?

449
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:40,670
He told me that he has a meeting.

450
00:43:42,470 --> 00:43:43,790
A business meeting or something.

451
00:43:45,150 --> 00:43:46,390
Looks like the rumor is true.

452
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:47,510
Pim!

453
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:48,350
What?

454
00:43:50,870 --> 00:43:52,870
What is it? Something happens?

455
00:43:53,710 --> 00:43:54,350
Ah!

456
00:43:56,390 --> 00:43:59,670
It’s nothing. We’re just chatting in general.

457
00:43:59,670 --> 00:44:00,310
Yeah, we are.

458
00:44:01,030 --> 00:44:01,830
Yo.

459
00:44:02,110 --> 00:44:02,670
Hmm?

460
00:44:03,270 --> 00:44:04,030
You’re a terrible liar.

461
00:44:04,270 --> 00:44:04,870
Why?

462
00:44:04,870 --> 00:44:05,870
What am I lying?

463
00:44:05,870 --> 00:44:08,030
When you’re lying, your nose always gets bigger.

464
00:44:09,670 --> 00:44:10,510
Just tell me what is this about?

465
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:14,390
Why is this room so humid?

466
00:44:14,390 --> 00:44:16,830
I’m all greasy now.

467
00:44:18,390 --> 00:44:19,270
You’re also a terrible liar.

468
00:44:20,590 --> 00:44:21,790
Hmm?

469
00:44:22,350 --> 00:44:23,310
So what is it really?

470
00:44:27,390 --> 00:44:28,910
Tell me now what is it?

471
00:44:30,110 --> 00:44:33,350
Are we supposed to tell things like this to friends?

472
00:44:34,670 --> 00:44:35,670
Gossip time!

473
00:44:36,470 --> 00:44:36,910
Do tell me now.

474
00:44:42,310 --> 00:44:43,790
Just a few days ago.

475
00:44:44,110 --> 00:44:44,510
Okay?

476
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:47,910
There was a HISO woman who came to the company.

477
00:44:49,550 --> 00:44:50,630
And…

478
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:53,830
People are talking.

479
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:55,070
About?

480
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,150
She’s the fiance of the president.

481
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:02,150
Er…

482
00:45:02,390 --> 00:45:04,910
It’s probably nothing. People just like to gossip.

483
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:05,910
You don’t have to care about them.

484
00:45:06,350 --> 00:45:06,990
Isn’t that right, Lin?

485
00:45:10,830 --> 00:45:13,350
And they posted a picture together.

486
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:21,310
I heard her name is Allie.

487
00:45:22,350 --> 00:45:24,350
She’s a close relative of  Madame Amaraporn.

488
00:45:32,510 --> 00:45:34,070
P’Sun already has a fiance?

489
00:45:45,550 --> 00:45:49,070
Lin, I brought some of your favorites.

490
00:45:49,950 --> 00:45:50,950
I brought quite a lot.

491
00:46:13,390 --> 00:46:14,150
Excuse me?

492
00:46:14,790 --> 00:46:16,070
Where is the patient now?

493
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:18,750
The patient has already gone back this morning.

494
00:46:19,670 --> 00:46:20,990
If there’s nothing else then may I excuse myself.

495
00:46:22,030 --> 00:46:22,590
Thanks.

496
00:46:30,750 --> 00:46:38,430
The number you have dialed is currently unavailable.

497
00:47:04,470 --> 00:47:05,150
Lin!

498
00:47:14,350 --> 00:47:15,030
Lin!

499
00:48:10,110 --> 00:48:11,230
Can you just leave?

500
00:48:11,590 --> 00:48:13,830
If you’re not coming then I won’t go back.

501
00:48:14,230 --> 00:48:17,310
A person like him can’t really handle a little bit of struggle.

502
00:48:17,510 --> 00:48:19,230
Eventually he will run away.

503
00:48:19,350 --> 00:48:20,310
Are you free this evening?

504
00:48:20,710 --> 00:48:21,350
I am.

505
00:48:21,910 --> 00:48:22,790
Is there anything I can do for you?

506
00:48:23,190 --> 00:48:25,190
Do you really want me as your mentor that much?

507
00:48:25,350 --> 00:48:27,590
Actually, it’s not that I don’t like you.

508
00:48:27,670 --> 00:48:29,670
He’s been engaging for a while.

509
00:48:29,990 --> 00:48:31,510
And do they love each other?

510
00:48:32,070 --> 00:48:34,110
I trust whatever decision you’ve made.
