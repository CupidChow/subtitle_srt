1
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,600
If we see each other too often,

2
00:00:06,920 --> 00:00:07,920
people will find out about us.

3
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:08,400
Shit!

4
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:10,120
You record this!

5
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:11,720
If you’re not being stubborn with me

6
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:13,160
and getting better fast.

7
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:14,440
I have something to show you

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,560
but you have to come see at my house.

9
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,960
Wow! These are so beautiful.

10
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:21,240
Can we kiss?

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:26,480
Where are you going?

12
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:28,520
Do you need my help with anything?

13
00:00:28,520 --> 00:00:31,120
I have the documents in my hand. I’m heading back right now.

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:33,360
What?! Lin is at the police station!

15
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:34,760
What?!

16
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:37,600
1 hour earlier.

17
00:00:47,400 --> 00:00:50,960
Oh! What brings you to our department?

18
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,800
I’m here to check on the progress of the Amaraporn’s project.

19
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:01,400
Alright!

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:02,640
By the way,

21
00:01:05,120 --> 00:01:07,880
where are all the interns?

22
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,200
I heard that there is a situation with Lin where he is at the police station right now.

23
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:11,960
Really?

24
00:01:13,120 --> 00:01:13,880
A police station?

25
00:01:15,160 --> 00:01:16,560
Yes, at the police station.

26
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:22,280
Okay, we will go to the toilet first.

27
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,360
Go, go, go.

28
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,080
See you all down there then.

29
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:25,560
O.K.

30
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:26,039
Let’s go.

31
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:28,680
Sam, I have a stomach ache. Come with me, will you?

32
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,840
I can’t hold it in anymore.

33
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,200
Are you alright?

34
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:48,560
Did you get hurt?

35
00:01:48,759 --> 00:01:49,960
You need to tell me now.

36
00:01:50,080 --> 00:01:51,000
Where is it?

37
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:53,440
I’m fine.

38
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:56,240
Your face is all red now.

39
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:22,920
President! What are you doing here?

40
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:29,960
Uhm…

41
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:41,800
So the person that you've been dating all this time is the president?

42
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:43,120
Our president?

43
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:46,960
Why didn’t you tell us anything before?

44
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,960
It’s complicated.

45
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,040
I have all the time in the world.

46
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,240
So, you must tell us everything.

47
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:03,080
And, we really mean everything!

48
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:06,080
Fine,

49
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,400
I’ll tell you everything.

50
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:09,200
But..

51
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,960
can we talk later?

52
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:20,920
You have to make a promise with us

53
00:04:21,360 --> 00:04:24,160
that you will tell us everything today.

54
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,880
All the things, everything, no more secrets.

55
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:31,360
Alright, I promised.

56
00:04:36,680 --> 00:04:37,480
Everybody!

57
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,800
Since all of you knew about the relationship between me and Lin.

58
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:51,000
I would like you guys to keep this as a secret.

59
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,640
Well, at least until the internship is over.

60
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:00,520
I don’t want anyone

61
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:02,440
to think negatively about Lin.

62
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,400
I want everyone to see him for his ability

63
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:08,800
not on my relationship between me and him.

64
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:17,040
I hope that all of you will understand the situation.

65
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,240
Please help me with this.

66
00:05:33,159 --> 00:05:33,960
Lin!

67
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,400
Yes?

68
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,600
We need to talk.

69
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:41,320
We’ll talk later, okay?

70
00:05:59,120 --> 00:05:59,920
Gossip time!

71
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:03,080
Breaking news!

72
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:09,040
Salin and the president is a couple.

73
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,080
Hey! What are you doing? Give it back!

74
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,240
I know you too well. I know that you’d be like this.

75
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:20,800
Here look!

76
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,360
Wow!

77
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:23,520
What?

78
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,680
You’re really something else.

79
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Not a very nice person!

80
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,680
What are you all doing? Give my phone back to me!

81
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,680
You heard what the president said.

82
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,080
He said not to tell anyone.

83
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:37,840
So, are you really going to spread this to everyone?

84
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,360
Do you want yours out also?

85
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:45,720
If you even dare to talk about this to anyone.

86
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:49,040
We will print out your picture and the president’s secretary

87
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,000
and give it to everyone.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:51,720
You’ll see!

89
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:56,880
Fine!

90
00:06:57,760 --> 00:06:58,560
I’ll keep my mouth shut!

91
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:20,240
Thanks.

92
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:20,760
O.K.

93
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:30,320
Lin

94
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:31,960
Yes?

95
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:33,560
Feeling better?

96
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,240
I’m all better now.

97
00:07:44,040 --> 00:07:47,840
I just found out that you’re a taekwondoist.

98
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,880
You’re so small but so strong.

99
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,520
Very good!

100
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,200
My dad sent me to learn taekwondo even before I attended my school.

101
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:03,480
It might not look like it but I was a taekwondoist at my university.

102
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,800
Is that so?

103
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
Do I have to be careful around you?

104
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,560
Maybe, if you’re doing something that I don’t like.

105
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:18,280
Why? I’ll get kicked by a taekwondoist?

106
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:24,440
You sure will!

107
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:27,000
Try not do things my way!

108
00:08:27,600 --> 00:08:28,960
You’ll see!

109
00:08:41,799 --> 00:08:43,080
I’m so sorry about what happened today.

110
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
Sorry that I accidentally revealed our secret.

111
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,080
It’s totally fine.

112
00:08:57,760 --> 00:08:58,560
I’m not upset or anything.

113
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:03,800
You must be in shock too right?

114
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:08,640
Don’t overthink alright?

115
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,960
Do you want me to help and talk with your friends?

116
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:21,560
Okay?

117
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,280
I think I can talk with them.

118
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:27,920
I don’t want you to fix the problem alone.

119
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:30,440
Can I? Please?

120
00:09:30,440 --> 00:09:32,520
I’m not doing it alone.

121
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:34,200
Here!

122
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,320
I have you with me.

123
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,600
About Pim and Yo, I think I'll talk with them myself.

124
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:42,800
Don’t you worry.

125
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:45,160
Is that really what you want?

126
00:09:45,520 --> 00:09:46,200
Yes!

127
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:47,880
Smile for me first.

128
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:51,480
Alright.

129
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,600
I better get going.

130
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,000
Pim and Yo, they’ve been waiting for quite a while now.

131
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,520
Okay!

132
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,680
I’m leaving now.

133
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,120
Okay?

134
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:04,600
I’m really going.

135
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,200
Goodbye!

136
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:08,560
I’m letting go of your hand now.

137
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,200
You took advantage of me off guard!

138
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:30,680
I’m really going home now.

139
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:33,520
Bye bye.

140
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:45,520
Since when have you two met?

141
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:46,760
Has he ever hurted you?

142
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:47,760
Are you two an official couple?

143
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:48,600
Did you guys already do it?

144
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:49,800
You already did?

145
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:50,920
Did you use any protection?

146
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:51,800
Lin!

147
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:52,960
You two! Stop!

148
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:54,120
Uhm..

149
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
You are keep on interrogating with many questions,

150
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,720
and I don’t know what to answer first.

151
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,920
All of them!

152
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,480
P’Sun is..

153
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:11,200
He is the guy that you matched me with in the App.

154
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:11,760
For real?

155
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:15,280
The president!

156
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:18,640
Is the one in the app?

157
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:21,640
Also the one who took you to the hotel

158
00:11:22,120 --> 00:11:23,440
until the morning?

159
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:25,600
Wait..

160
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,920
Was he also the one with you in Hong Kong also?

161
00:11:30,400 --> 00:11:31,880
That was the president right?

162
00:11:33,400 --> 00:11:34,080
You’re right.

163
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:35,200
Huhh…

164
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,080
Oh my god!

165
00:11:38,040 --> 00:11:39,800
Where did you go to wish for him?

166
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,120
How did you get a very good one?

167
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:45,680
Are you serious?

168
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:46,200
Why?!

169
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:49,000
We are Thai. It’s our belief system.

170
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,920
Honestly, I feel a bit slighted.

171
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,840
Why do you have to keep it from us?

172
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,760
When it’s me,

173
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:00,920
whoever I talk to or

174
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,920
whoever I date

175
00:12:02,520 --> 00:12:04,040
I alway tell you everything.

176
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:07,120
Actually, That’s true.

177
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,080
She really tells us every detail.

178
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,360
She trusts me,

179
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,520
unlike someone.

180
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:16,440
It’s not that I don’t trust you guys.

181
00:12:16,840 --> 00:12:19,360
I just couldn’t find the right moment to tell you.

182
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:20,800
Another thing,

183
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:24,240
me and him are not officially dating just yet.

184
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:27,560
We’re just learning about each other.

185
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:29,520
Should I be upset about this?

186
00:12:29,520 --> 00:12:30,560
I know..

187
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:32,360
I’m sorry.

188
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:35,480
From now on,

189
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,880
no matter what it is I’ll tell you guys everything.

190
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,680
I promise!

191
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:46,400
Let make a promise!

192
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,240
Pim..

193
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,120
Yo..

194
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,760
Yo..

195
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:58,920
Then my apology to you guys is

196
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:01,280
I will be buying your lunch for a month.

197
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,560
Make it two!

198
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,600
Since you are a rich kid Lin.

199
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:13,480
Fine two months.

200
00:13:14,280 --> 00:13:15,080
Deal?

201
00:13:15,520 --> 00:13:16,320
Yes!

202
00:13:17,240 --> 00:13:18,040
Pim?

203
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:19,520
Deal?

204
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,960
But…

205
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,200
You have to tell us everything from now on.

206
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,560
Got it?/She’s right!

207
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:29,560
You’ve got that.

208
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:31,760
Let’s hug.

209
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:23,000
Sam!

210
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:25,600
What are you doing here?

211
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:26,720
I’m hungry.

212
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:28,800
Can you come with me?

213
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:34,480
You came here because you’re hungry?

214
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,480
Yeah, I don't know where to go so I came here. Perhaps you know some good restaurants.

215
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:41,520
And why do I have to come with you?

216
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:43,320
Ouch!

217
00:14:43,640 --> 00:14:45,160
I’m starving!

218
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,320
Starving to dead!

219
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:51,760
Quiet! People can hear you!

220
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:14,800
Fine, if you want!

221
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,440
But I won’t take you out at this time.

222
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,680
Wow!..

223
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,920
It looks so appetizing!

224
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,640
I didn't know that you can cook.

225
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,560
It’s not that.

226
00:15:50,640 --> 00:15:52,360
These are just some leftovers.

227
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:55,000
Although,

228
00:15:55,360 --> 00:15:56,800
I have some work to get done.

229
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,720
So eat fast and out of my way.

230
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:16,440
What’s wrong?

231
00:16:18,280 --> 00:16:19,560
Why don’t you eat?

232
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,440
I’m scared, I don’t know if you’re trying to poison me.

233
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,040
Seriously? Watch too many movies or something.

234
00:16:26,400 --> 00:16:27,960
In that case If you don’t want to eat then just go.

235
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:29,240
Okay! I’ll eat you food.

236
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:37,920
I might have to come to eat here more.

237
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:39,680
This is really good.

238
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:57,160
Are you feeling better now about Lin?

239
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:00,640
Am I supposed to feel bad or something?

240
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:05,920
I saw you and Pim were really shocked about it.

241
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:08,880
So I don’t really know if you are hurt because of it or not.

242
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:13,599
It’s not that.

243
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:16,240
I’m just worried for my friend.

244
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,760
Lin really prioritizes you and Pims’ feelings.

245
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,760
That’s why he wanted to tell you guys in the right moment.

246
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:39,200
Can you just go back and eat?

247
00:17:46,800 --> 00:17:47,680
And finish it also!

248
00:17:48,120 --> 00:17:49,080
If not I’ll throw them away now.

249
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,440
Calm down, I’ll eat now.

250
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:52,360
I haven’t really eaten it just yet.

251
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:53,840
I only just took a bite.

252
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:57,080
Well, hurry then, Once you finish, put all the dishes right there.

253
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,320
Copy that!

254
00:17:58,320 --> 00:17:59,400
I’ll get back to work now.

255
00:17:59,400 --> 00:18:00,440
Thanks!

256
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:29,360
Here, you two need to store all of these documents in the drawers.

257
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,440
The first two drawers belong to the accounting department.

258
00:18:33,720 --> 00:18:36,000
These two are for the designing department.

259
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,280
P’Dis, these are so many documents

260
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,480
and there are only two of us.

261
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:43,960
Two is enough!

262
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:46,880
P’Kaew, she doesn’t want many people around here.

263
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:47,760
Okay?

264
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,640
Also, don’t be slacking off. Work hard!

265
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,320
Another thing!

266
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,040
All the documents in those cabinets are restricted from you two.

267
00:18:59,040 --> 00:19:02,040
Those are really important ones.

268
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:03,480
Alright.

269
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:10,000
Darn it!

270
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:13,840
Did he really just tell us that? How can we know which ones belong to which department?

271
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:14,600
Huh..

272
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:16,320
Let’s just get to work.

273
00:19:17,000 --> 00:19:19,280
These will be stored in the document room right?

274
00:19:19,280 --> 00:19:21,120
Let me help you.

275
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:21,920
Stop!

276
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:34,760
Pim!

277
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,120
Shit!

278
00:19:38,120 --> 00:19:39,520
What are you doing?

279
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:40,800
Let me see,

280
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:43,960
why are these documents kept from us?

281
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,160
Do you understand what it said? / No.

282
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,040
Then just close it.

283
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,000
You take this.

284
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:58,080
I’ll put them back in their place.

285
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,160
What a nosy person.

286
00:20:01,160 --> 00:20:04,400
He just said that these are restricted.

287
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:06,760
You will get me in trouble.

288
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,440
Where do I keep this?

289
00:20:08,720 --> 00:20:12,080
Read the label on the cover! Didn’t you listen to him?

290
00:20:14,880 --> 00:20:15,840
This way please.

291
00:20:16,040 --> 00:20:21,240
I’m so tired they always make me lift boxes.

292
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:23,240
I can’t even do anything else.

293
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:26,200
Huhh, my arms are all sore now.

294
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,760
Lin, what are you doing?

295
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,160
I’m just going through all of the old designs of P’Prim before she works here.

296
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:38,680
P’Prim?

297
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:40,680
Let me see.

298
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:41,920
They are so beautiful.

299
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:43,320
Wow!

300
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,120
Isn’t this one pretty?

301
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:46,080
Oh my god! Stunning!

302
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:47,680
Agreed!

303
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,120
Her designs are very unique to hers.

304
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:50,760
True!

305
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:53,200
But ever since she works here,

306
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,320
her designs are kind of repetitive.

307
00:20:57,920 --> 00:21:00,720
I think maybe because that is what she got instructed to do.

308
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:02,360
That might be the reason why she can’t really let her creative side shines.

309
00:21:03,920 --> 00:21:04,720
You’re right.

310
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:07,480
What is your problem?

311
00:21:12,840 --> 00:21:14,160
I made my decision.

312
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:17,680
I will devote myself to her as a student.

313
00:21:17,800 --> 00:21:18,720
What?

314
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,960
Devote yourself?

315
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:22,200
Are you sure about this?

316
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,720
Doesn’t it sound quite ambiguous?

317
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:25,680
I don’t think that is a good idea.

318
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:30,040
I mean I’ll do everything for her.

319
00:21:30,160 --> 00:21:31,320
Everything!

320
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:37,600
Time’s ticking, I better get going now.

321
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:39,200
Pim!

322
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:40,160
Pim!

323
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:44,800
Do everything?

324
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:46,800
Or…

325
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:50,800
Or?

326
00:21:52,760 --> 00:21:53,560
What’s up with you?

327
00:21:56,920 --> 00:21:58,240
P’Prim

328
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:01,800
Yes?

329
00:22:02,280 --> 00:22:04,480
Do you need any help?

330
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,280
Like your ongoing project.

331
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,640
No, nothing.

332
00:22:12,520 --> 00:22:14,640
What about any other work?

333
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,600
I will do anything for you?

334
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,960
What do you want? Just say it.

335
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:34,880
I mean…

336
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:39,200
I want to learn from you.

337
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:42,640
Can you teach me?

338
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:47,880
How about you start with sitting quietly at your desk?

339
00:23:10,600 --> 00:23:11,680
Are you okay?

340
00:23:11,680 --> 00:23:12,680
No! I’m not okay.

341
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:21,760
That’s okay

342
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:24,240
It’s just she doesn’t love you.

343
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:25,800
Yo!

344
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,000
Although, it could be possible someday.

345
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,200
Right? Lin.

346
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:32,160
Yes.

347
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:34,520
That someday is just not today.

348
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:38,880
Not even for the next week.

349
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:00,280
Huh…

350
00:24:00,920 --> 00:24:02,000
I’m too tired.

351
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:03,360
I’ll go home now.

352
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:04,000
Okay,

353
00:24:04,840 --> 00:24:07,720
a burned out person like you should just rest.

354
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:10,720
Alright! A girl on fire.

355
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,240
Let me tell you one thing.

356
00:24:23,240 --> 00:24:24,160
If you’re just sitting here,

357
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:26,000
she won’t care for you.

358
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,080
I’m going home now.

359
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,040
Care for me?

360
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:32,800
P’Prim, goodbye.

361
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:37,200
Just sitting..

362
00:24:38,440 --> 00:24:39,320
Care for me?

363
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:45,480
Yo does have a brain after all.

364
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,440
P’Prim, would you like a cup of coffee?

365
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,280
I’m really sorry!

366
00:25:17,480 --> 00:25:18,600
I didn’t mean to.

367
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,240
I’ll get something to clean this up for you.

368
00:25:20,320 --> 00:25:21,120
Again, I’m really sorry.

369
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,880
Can you stop hovering with me?

370
00:25:28,920 --> 00:25:31,360
P’Prim.. Did you get to save it?

371
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:33,280
Did it look like I got a chance to do anything?

372
00:25:35,080 --> 00:25:36,240
I’m really sorry from the bottom of my heart.

373
00:25:36,520 --> 00:25:37,880
I didn’t really want this to happen.

374
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,480
Really sorry.

375
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,360
It’s all ruined now.

376
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:50,520
I will do it all for you again.

377
00:25:52,160 --> 00:25:53,520
The design?

378
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:55,200
Or will you ruin everything again?

379
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,760
Can you just go away?

380
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:11,120
Can you please give me a chance?

381
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:28,720
If you really think you can then try.

382
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,000
It’s time to go home now.

383
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,640
I’m sorry, you can go now.

384
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,360
Why won’t he answer my text?

385
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,840
He might be busy?

386
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:11,080
Yes?

387
00:27:12,080 --> 00:27:13,560
You’re talking to me?

388
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:14,160
No.

389
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,080
Wait, Chan.

390
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:21,600
Yes?

391
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,200
Have you ever had a boyfriend?

392
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:32,520
Have I?

393
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:35,680
Well,

394
00:27:38,920 --> 00:27:40,200
I have .

395
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,960
If you have to cheer your boyfriend up.

396
00:27:45,240 --> 00:27:46,040
How do you do that?

397
00:27:47,640 --> 00:27:48,440
Do you mean

398
00:27:50,280 --> 00:27:51,560
to do that to Salin?

399
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:53,720
Yeah!

400
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:59,640
I know that he’s been working very hard lately.

401
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:02,960
Ah!

402
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:07,080
Actually, I don’t really do much.

403
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:09,360
It’s him who mostly does all that.

404
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:14,640
I normally would do chores around the house like clean the floor, wash the dishes,

405
00:28:15,280 --> 00:28:19,920
or wash his clothes. Just to be able to help him out a little makes me happy.

406
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:36,120
The room is quite messy now.

407
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,120
I haven’t been cleaning in up properly for a while.

408
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,720
I’ve been quite busy lately so

409
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:45,840
I don’t have the time to do all that.

410
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:50,720
There’s no need for that.

411
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,480
You can just get to work.

412
00:28:53,800 --> 00:28:54,600
But…

413
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:56,920
You don’t have to worry about me.

414
00:28:56,920 --> 00:28:57,800
I’m totally fine here.

415
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,640
Didn’t I told you

416
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,400
that I will be the one taking care of you?

417
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,560
I’ll be your butler today.

418
00:29:08,120 --> 00:29:09,520
No, you don’t have to.

419
00:29:09,800 --> 00:29:11,160
It’s not something you need to do.

420
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,440
That’s alright.

421
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,840
If you really feel bad about this,

422
00:29:13,840 --> 00:29:15,560
you just have to finish the work for me.

423
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:17,640
Alright.

424
00:29:30,560 --> 00:29:31,720
I’ll put it right here okay?

425
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:32,680
Okay.

426
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,360
Thank you.

427
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:43,320
Over there, walk over there.

428
00:29:45,720 --> 00:29:47,440
You wore a lot of clothes.

429
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:08,080
P’Sun?

430
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:11,680
Why don’t you use a vacuum cleaner?

431
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:14,120
It’s in that spot over there.

432
00:30:17,280 --> 00:30:18,200
Actually, this one..

433
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:26,800
This one is not really making any noises.

434
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,600
I don’t want to disturb you.

435
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,720
That one will create loud noises.

436
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:02,680
Lin!

437
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:04,240
Yes?

438
00:31:04,720 --> 00:31:06,720
Did you draw this painting yourself?

439
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,840
Yes, I did.

440
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:15,240
That was when

441
00:31:15,880 --> 00:31:18,200
my dad took me to watch the sunset at our farmhouse.

442
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,320
It’s a shame that

443
00:31:21,240 --> 00:31:24,000
I didn’t take any photos so I drew it instead.

444
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:26,680
It may not look exactly the same.

445
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:31,000
Is this mean…

446
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:33,800
you like to watch the sunset.

447
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:40,080
Do you also like it too?

448
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:47,000
I feel at peace when I watch it.

449
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:52,440
It’s like all the problems that I faced throughout out day

450
00:31:53,920 --> 00:31:54,840
are just gone.

451
00:31:56,040 --> 00:31:56,960
Same for me.

452
00:31:59,880 --> 00:32:02,640
Everytime I see the sun slowly setting

453
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,840
I feel like I lost in a moment.

454
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:10,440
It makes me more presence.

455
00:32:11,280 --> 00:32:14,760
It’s like I’m getting to know myself more

456
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:20,320
but excited at the same time.

457
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:23,680
Excited to see the moon.

458
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,400
Then..

459
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:34,640
If we have the time.

460
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:38,600
Can we go together?

461
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,720
That’d be good.

462
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:51,680
So how is it?

463
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:53,240
Did you get your work done?

464
00:32:55,040 --> 00:32:56,560
Is the work get done easier

465
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:58,920
since I took you to see all the jewelry.

466
00:32:59,600 --> 00:33:01,840
That really helps me a lot.

467
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:05,240
I even finished my first draft.

468
00:33:05,960 --> 00:33:09,480
Thanks to you for taking me to see all the pieces.

469
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,600
It’s inspired me so much.

470
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:14,880
That is nice to hear.

471
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:19,520
The reason why I took you there was because I want you to work better.

472
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:22,360
If you have anything problems,

473
00:33:24,200 --> 00:33:25,560
you can just tell me anything.

474
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:33,400
But personally I believe that you can get through it all.

475
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,320
I’ll do my best.

476
00:34:36,239 --> 00:34:38,480
This place is…

477
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,320
This is my mountain house.

478
00:34:41,280 --> 00:34:43,639
Why did you bring me here?

479
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,199
You’ll find out once you’re inside.

480
00:34:49,719 --> 00:34:51,199
Come on, let’s go.

481
00:34:52,120 --> 00:34:53,159
You’ll be late.

482
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
Thanks.

483
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,360
So beautiful!

484
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:11,760
We’re ready.

485
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:56,720
Wow!

486
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:07,480
This place is so mesmerizing.

487
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:10,960
Don’t say that the reason that you took me to Khao Yai

488
00:36:10,960 --> 00:36:12,240
is just to watch..

489
00:36:12,480 --> 00:36:13,480
You’re right.

490
00:36:15,320 --> 00:36:17,040
We get to watch the sunset together.

491
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:21,440
This is so amazing.

492
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:26,560
The weather is also very nice.

493
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:34,240
Nu-Lin.

494
00:36:34,840 --> 00:36:35,640
Yes?

495
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:41,160
I think you are the one for me.

496
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,200
I can’t wait any longer.

497
00:36:53,800 --> 00:36:55,000
Will you be my boyfriend?

498
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:12,560
About that…

499
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:20,000
I think we should discuss this after I’m done with my internship.

500
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:25,080
I’m really worried about your image in the company

501
00:37:26,440 --> 00:37:28,440
and you just appointed the position too.

502
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,640
How about you don’t care about the consequences?

503
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,400
How about you only think about your feelings?

504
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,600
Do you want to be my boyfriend?

505
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:56,840
Yes, I want to.

506
00:38:02,600 --> 00:38:03,400
Then…

507
00:38:06,520 --> 00:38:08,760
Can I ask you to follow your feelings only?

508
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,560
Yes, I will.

509
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:17,520
About our relationship,

510
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:22,560
we will talk later about when we will make it public.

511
00:39:11,320 --> 00:39:12,120
At this moment from now on,

512
00:39:16,760 --> 00:39:19,240
you’re officially my boyfriend.

513
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:06,160
Hmm…

514
00:41:06,760 --> 00:41:07,640
This is really good.

515
00:41:10,640 --> 00:41:11,920
I eat food everyday

516
00:41:12,880 --> 00:41:14,320
but why does it taste better all of the sudden today.

517
00:41:17,200 --> 00:41:18,000
P’Sun,

518
00:41:18,880 --> 00:41:23,200
There’s a thing that I want to do

519
00:41:24,240 --> 00:41:25,480
once I had a boyfriend.

520
00:41:28,280 --> 00:41:29,280
Want to do?

521
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,360
Yay!

522
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,120
Is it really okay with you?

523
00:41:37,480 --> 00:41:38,320
It’s not that.

524
00:41:38,720 --> 00:41:40,520
It’s not what you think it is.

525
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:47,680
I want us to have a couple cute names.

526
00:41:48,080 --> 00:41:51,760
Just like other couples like names that only us used to call each other.

527
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:53,120
Hmm…

528
00:41:54,200 --> 00:41:55,320
What should that be?

529
00:41:56,440 --> 00:41:59,160
What do you  want to call me when you look at me?

530
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:05,960
To call you without actually calling your name.

531
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:10,200
How about I call you Khun Dad?

532
00:42:10,720 --> 00:42:13,400
What? What is it again?

533
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,240
Khun Dad.

534
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:18,800
I like it.

535
00:42:20,560 --> 00:42:23,920
Then how about Khun Dad and Nu-Lin.

536
00:42:24,960 --> 00:42:25,760
I like that as well.

537
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:27,200
Okay.

538
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,720
How about you? Don’t you have anything that you want to do with your boyfriend?

539
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:36,400
Of course, I do.

540
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:38,200
What is it then?

541
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:03,600
This is like a reminder that you’re mine.

542
00:43:10,360 --> 00:43:13,080
I’ll let you put it on my right hand since it is for reminding.

543
00:43:24,480 --> 00:43:25,280
Wow!

544
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:27,840
This is so beautiful.

545
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:45,960
There’s another thing that I want to do.

546
00:43:48,640 --> 00:43:50,560
Can I ask you to dance with me?

547
00:43:59,480 --> 00:44:01,800
Always yes for Khun Dad.

548
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:13,840
Although, I’m not really good at it

549
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:17,000
but I’ll try my best.

550
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:19,440
I’m not really good at it either

551
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,760
but I just want to dance with you.

552
00:50:33,560 --> 00:50:35,560
Whatever you want to do

553
00:50:37,080 --> 00:50:38,200
you have to do it with me.

554
00:50:39,240 --> 00:50:40,840
Don’t do it with someone else.

555
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:32,000
I think it’s time that you tell me what’s wrong.

556
00:51:32,600 --> 00:51:33,400
Lin!

557
00:51:33,840 --> 00:51:35,480
I have a nightmare.

558
00:51:35,480 --> 00:51:37,840
Who’s that? And I’ve been having the same nightmare for quite some time now.

559
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,800
I’m right here by your side.

560
00:51:40,720 --> 00:51:41,800
You don’t have to be scared of anything.

561
00:51:42,080 --> 00:51:43,120
President!

562
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,680
Something’s happened to Salin.

563
00:51:44,680 --> 00:51:46,280
Did you copy the design from someone else?

564
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:47,720
I did not.

565
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:49,440
If you really did yourself,

566
00:51:49,440 --> 00:51:50,960
how could it get copyrighted from another work.

567
00:51:51,200 --> 00:51:52,880
I didn’t really do that, P’Sun.
