00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:36,520
was cut out.

168
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:38,600
What kind of vision does Yu Fei have?

169
00:11:38,600 --> 00:11:40,640
Why would she like a guy like that?

170
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,200
It's been so long since she broke up,

171
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,400
but she hasn't cried.

172
00:11:43,400 --> 00:11:44,000
Dao.

173
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:47,040
Are you listening, Dao?

174
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
Why don't you say anything?

175
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,680
Yeah, you're exposed, too.

176
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,800
No.

177
00:11:57,360 --> 00:11:58,760
All this gossip

178
00:11:58,760 --> 00:11:59,920
is made up.

179
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:02,080
I saw that video of them.

180
00:12:02,080 --> 00:12:02,840
They

181
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
are just fake couples.

182
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:06,840
Look, their eyes and their movement

183
00:12:06,840 --> 00:12:08,400
are clearly staged.

184
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:19,520
Yu Fei.

185
00:12:21,560 --> 00:12:22,720
You don't really have to force yourself

186
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,640
to cheer for everything.

187
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:28,760
You don't have to be so strong.

188
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:33,680
If you want to cry... 
 I don't want to cry.

189
00:12:44,360 --> 00:12:46,000
I don't want to cry.

190
00:12:47,080 --> 00:12:48,360
Why does each and every one of you

191
00:12:48,360 --> 00:12:50,000
have to come and warn me?

192
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:54,840
I particularly want to know

193
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:56,600
how long do you think is appropriate for

194
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:58,280
a relationship to be mourned.

195
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:13,000
I will go first.

196
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:20,120
Are you OK?

197
00:13:20,120 --> 00:13:21,360
Don't come here.

198
00:13:25,240 --> 00:13:26,880
I am embarrassed now.

199
00:13:30,400 --> 00:13:32,000
Don't hold me

200
00:13:33,560 --> 00:13:35,280
or comfort me.

201
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,760
I can do it myself.

202
00:14:02,760 --> 00:14:04,760
[Dream of the South]

203
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,160
How can there be such a person?

204
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,320
It was Lingjiu who threw herself on you,

205
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,020
[Lingjiu meets Guanshanqianchong in the middle of the night]

206
00:14:19,880 --> 00:14:21,320
but you threw her away.

207
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:23,560
Why is it called flirting?

208
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:25,200
How could they think of that?

209
00:14:28,920 --> 00:14:30,520
I'll prepare the clarification now.

210
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,680
Should I send a lawyer's letter

211
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,400
to today's press?

212
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,520
No need.

213
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:39,600
No clarification or no lawyer's letter?

214
00:14:39,880 --> 00:14:40,840
Neither of them.

215
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,480
Is it true?

216
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,280
This show is important.

217
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:55,880
I can accept that

218
00:14:55,880 --> 00:14:57,120
you use Lingjiu instead of Liu Xichan.

219
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,280
But even if you needed publicity badly,

220
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:01,240
you didn't have to do it this way.

221
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,360
Didn't you always say

222
00:15:16,640 --> 00:15:18,480
we should use our work to speak for us?

223
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:25,560
The premise of speaking with the work itself

224
00:15:26,440 --> 00:15:28,480
is that the audience are willing to enter the theater

225
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:31,240
and give the work a chance to speak.

226
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:34,800
This time,

227
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:36,800
we should not only

228
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:38,120
let the original audience of the work walk into the theater,

229
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:39,440
but also let those

230
00:15:40,640 --> 00:15:42,200
who do not know,

231
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:43,920
do not like

232
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:45,880
or even have prejudice against ancient stage plays

233
00:15:45,880 --> 00:15:46,800
walk into the theater.

234
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,080
Even if they're here to make fun of us

235
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:51,480
or to pick on us,

236
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:54,880
when they sit down,

237
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:58,720
the lights go down

238
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,640
and the curtain goes up,

239
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,680
we will have a chance

240
00:16:06,640 --> 00:16:08,320
to show them

241
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:09,920
the magic of

242
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,640
an ancient stage play.

243
00:16:25,960 --> 00:16:27,920
Is it worth to

244
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:31,200
use all your perseverance

245
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:32,680
to exchange for the success this time?

246
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,200
Yes.

247
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:39,080
This time we will also be

248
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:40,320
on the Internet New Year's Eve party.

249
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:42,800
We will be more successful than we thought.

250
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:59,000
'Dream of the South'

251
00:16:59,700 --> 00:17:02,000
'Dream of the South' script

252
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,240
OMG.

253
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,200
The suggestions are thicker than the script.

254
00:17:09,069 --> 00:17:10,520
The company doesn't agree to use Lingjiu

255
00:17:10,520 --> 00:17:12,000
in this show.

256
00:17:12,280 --> 00:17:13,720
But she insisted on coming.

257
00:17:14,520 --> 00:17:15,760
You are clear as well.

258
00:17:15,960 --> 00:17:17,069
The main reason people go to the theater

259
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:18,640
is to see Lingjiu.

260
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:19,920
We certainly have to make some changes

261
00:17:19,920 --> 00:17:21,040
to the story

262
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,920
to ensure the interests of our celebrity.

263
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:24,000
But there is

264
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,680
no Liu Xichan on this page.

265
00:17:25,880 --> 00:17:26,829
Should we change it too?

266
00:17:27,109 --> 00:17:27,960
Yes.

267
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,440
Although Liu Xichan

268
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,040
does not appear,

269
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:34,160
all the characters' lines

270
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,040
and performances

271
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:37,480
on this page are closely related to Liu Xichan's character design.

272
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:40,240
I understand things about personality.

273
00:17:40,520 --> 00:17:42,520
What's wrong with the music?

274
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,040
This is my field of expertise.

275
00:17:44,560 --> 00:17:46,520
I've already written down

276
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:47,880
the amendments.

277
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:49,040
A new Lingjiu single

278
00:17:49,040 --> 00:17:50,320
needs to be inserted.

279
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:51,000
We sent you the demo

280
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,520
an hour ago.

281
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:53,880
I have heard it.

282
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:57,000
It's like a retro disco thing.

283
00:17:57,640 --> 00:17:59,760
But it doesn't go with the stage play.

284
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,400
You're also from the classical stage.

285
00:18:03,400 --> 00:18:05,120
Do you think this is appropriate?

286
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:08,520
Lingjiu is free to save you.

287
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,880
Our requirement is like this.

288
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,360
It is your job

289
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
to arrange the music.

290
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:18,120
Since we are all friends who come to help,

291
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:19,640
don't give them a hard time.

292
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:24,280
I want to try the costume of Liu Xichan.

293
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:27,640
Am I air?

294
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,240
You are not air.

295
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:30,320
You are carbon monoxide,

296
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,440
the main component of automobile exhaust.

297
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
I want to try the costume now.

298
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,440
Tailor it based on my size.

299
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:39,440
Are you so fond of

300
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,200
wearing other people's leftover clothes?

301
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,120
I will make you a set of new clothes.

302
00:18:49,520 --> 00:18:51,520
Ask your agent to give me your size.

303
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,600
We avoid unnecessary communication.

304
00:18:54,440 --> 00:18:55,160
And

305
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,560
Boss is just ignoring

306
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:57,960
your message

307
00:18:57,960 --> 00:18:58,920
for now.

308
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:00,760
But please stop it.

309
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:01,840
Don't cross the line again.

310
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,680
Jiubai is not only his,

311
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,680
but also ours.

312
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,720
It's okay. Don't give it a second thought.

313
00:19:15,680 --> 00:19:17,080
Let it be like this first.

314
00:19:18,600 --> 00:19:19,520
Houlang.

315
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:20,680
Well done.

316
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:32,760
If it hurts, say it.

317
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,440
In that way,

318
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:37,080
I will know the place you hurt.

319
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:39,680
Thank you.

320
00:19:40,840 --> 00:19:43,360
There's really no orthopedic clinic around here.

321
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,240
I came here because I had to.

322
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:52,800
It does hurt.

323
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:54,720
But you have to endure it.

324
00:19:57,320 --> 00:19:58,960
When I do this,

325
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:00,840
you can relieve the pain.

326
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:02,640
It also helps the swelling go down.

327
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,800
I heard from Mr. Shang that

328
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,160
you are rehearsing

329
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,720
Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period.

330
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,320
So you stop the work there?

331
00:20:24,120 --> 00:20:24,960
OK.

332
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:26,680
I will do it myself.

333
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:31,640
Come on.

334
00:20:38,040 --> 00:20:39,760
You'd better take a rest for this.

335
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,400
When can I rehearse?

336
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:47,240
I know it's improper to say so,

337
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:50,400

00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:16,840
and don't shout onstage.

512
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:18,960
What you need to do

513
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:19,840
is to show that

514
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,680
you can't swim in the water

515
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,880
and struggle to breathe with that kind of wet sad.

516
00:31:24,520 --> 00:31:26,760
Then your emotion goes up with the rhythm.

517
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:29,600
What?

518
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:33,600
I am free this time.

519
00:31:34,720 --> 00:31:36,920
I can look at him more, right?

520
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:44,880
It was one o 'clock in the morning.

521
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:46,040
Go home early and get some rest.

522
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:51,560
I don't know what

523
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,240
is wet sadness.

524
00:31:54,320 --> 00:31:56,440
I'll tell you straight up in next rehearsal.

525
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:06,520
Boring.

526
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,560
My car won't come tonight.

527
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:20,200
Put me up for one night.

528
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:21,880
No.

529
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:27,120
Are you sure you're not thinking about

530
00:32:27,120 --> 00:32:28,320
making it real?

531
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,040
No.

532
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,320
Don't do this later.

533
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:46,600
I am serious.

534
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,400
This is my wet sadness.

535
00:32:59,320 --> 00:33:00,160
You have made me feel that

536
00:33:00,160 --> 00:33:02,160
in person for countless times.

537
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,120
The director of the Talking Stage will contact you.

538
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:17,960
This is the most popular online variety show right now.

539
00:33:17,960 --> 00:33:19,200
You can go there.

540
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,880
Although we are fake lovers,

541
00:33:23,320 --> 00:33:25,320
I help you with my true feelings.

542
00:33:27,400 --> 00:33:28,200
Good night.

543
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:10,560
Hello.

544
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,710
How is Mr. Bai?

545
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:15,960
OK.

546
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,880
I am collecting evidence.

547
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,880
I will send you

548
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,800
when I finish.

549
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:26,960
OK.

550
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,560
Yes.

551
00:34:29,960 --> 00:34:31,440
The investigation group

552
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,360
will begin within the week.

553
00:34:33,710 --> 00:34:35,040
I'll finish

554
00:34:35,800 --> 00:34:38,280
the rest of the contract before then.

555
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,920
OK.

556
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:07,040
Again?

557
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,480
No problem.

558
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,000
I am used to it.

559
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:19,040
I am used to passing by.

560
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,040
Everything in life

561
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,120
is unrelated to me.

562
00:35:27,320 --> 00:35:29,080
Because no matter how hard I struggle,

563
00:35:30,800 --> 00:35:31,800
at last,

564
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,000
I can only sink.

565
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,280
Until you said that

566
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:04,960
I was your lion,

567
00:36:08,080 --> 00:36:10,560
I finally got the sunshine

[I wish Bai feili successful in her investment]

569
00:36:11,440 --> 00:36:12,640
and the direction of life.

570
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,280
I am not good enough,

571
00:36:17,040 --> 00:36:19,520
but I am willing to love you

572
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,880
with all I have.

573
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:44,950
[A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice]
[Stand tall and straight Walk in light steps]

574
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:46,640
Come in.

575
00:36:48,640 --> 00:36:50,840
Mr. Nan, you called me?

576
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:54,920
Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period

577
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,880
is about to choose A and B roles.

578
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:59,800
Do you know what it means?

579
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:02,960
It means

580
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:04,640
I need to hurry with my training.

581
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,280
It means that

582
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,400
we're going to

583
00:37:09,840 --> 00:37:11,440
have to pre-advertise the ticket.

584
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:14,080
The investors

585
00:37:14,080 --> 00:37:15,280
have got an online variety show

586
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:18,520
called Talking Stage.

587
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,880
They're doing a cultural hedge,

588
00:37:20,880 --> 00:37:23,040
and they want us

589
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,280
to send there a representative.

590
00:37:26,160 --> 00:37:27,120
Do you want to go there?

591
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:29,880
Doesn't Li Shaoyan go there?

592
00:37:30,120 --> 00:37:31,320
He rejected.

593
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:33,200
After all,

594
00:37:33,880 --> 00:37:35,400
he is from an opera family.

595
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,960
The house is full of celebrities.

596
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,280
In the end,

597
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:44,560
this kind of show is not a decent thing.

598
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:46,080
He doesn't want to be

599
00:37:46,080 --> 00:37:47,160
a performing monkey.

600
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:50,600
You think

601
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,480
I am more proper?

602
00:37:53,040 --> 00:37:54,920
I am not the one who chose.

603
00:37:55,320 --> 00:37:56,760
Your friend

604
00:37:57,160 --> 00:37:59,120
Lou Shitang

605
00:37:59,120 --> 00:38:00,320
asked for you.

606
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:05,480
Yu Fei, I admit I have a bias against you.

607
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:08,480
Because we both know

608
00:38:08,480 --> 00:38:10,120
what that first meeting was.

609
00:38:11,520 --> 00:38:13,360
But I picked you

610
00:38:13,360 --> 00:38:14,880
when choosing roles.

611
00:38:14,880 --> 00:38:16,040
First,

612
00:38:17,120 --> 00:38:18,240
You have a good foundation.

613
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:19,680
You are a malleable talent.

614
00:38:20,560 --> 00:38:21,160
Second,

615
00:38:21,160 --> 00:38:24,560
Li Shaoyan has been pampered since childhood

616
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,440
and never suffered setbacks.

617
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,760
You are stubborn.

618
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,000
Putting you next to him, it's going to spark him.

619
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:33,240
I don't like to beat around the bush,

620
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,840
so I come to the point.

621
00:38:34,840 --> 00:38:35,960
From the beginning,

622
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:39,440
all I wanted was to let you be his practicing partner.

623
00:38:42,360 --> 00:38:43,720
However,

624
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:47,440
after this period of time,

625
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:48,960
I found out that

626
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:50,560
you do seem to be

627
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:54,000
a formidable character.

628
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,680
And now you're

629
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:59,840
the favorite for the A-role of Wu Zixu.

630
00:39:00,080 --> 00:39:01,520
You can

631
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,480
give the show a boost,

632
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,680
but I don't need

633
00:39:06,160 --> 00:39:07,480
the tickets from those people

634
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:09,080
to the show.

635
00:39:09,640 --> 00:39:11,160
Personally,

636
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,800
you are sure to be judged by your peers.

637
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:16,640
They'll think you're eager for fame.

638
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,600
After all, our traditional opera circle

639
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:20,720
is a well-regulated business

640
00:39:20,920 --> 00:39:22,160
that has been inherited from

641
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,160
generation to generation

642
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:26,080
by following old traditions.

643
00:39:26,480 --> 00:39:27,960
We don't like

644
00:39:27,960 --> 00:39:30,880
the behavior of showing off and degrading ourselves.

645
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,040
I will go there.

646
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,480
It doesn't matter

647
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,000
if you think I'm trying to gain credit or fame.

648
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,960
Opera has

649
00:39:41,160 --> 00:39:42,760
to be passed on.

650
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:44,960
If we want to pass it on,

651
00:39:44,960 --> 00:39:46,200
we have to change.

652
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:48,920
If Anhui troupes had had

653
00:39:49,120 --> 00:39:50,680
no ambition and fighting spirit,

654
00:39:51,360 --> 00:39:53,360
there wouldn't have been four Anhui troupes in Beijing,

655
00:39:54,680 --> 00:39:57,840
and they would not have laid the foundation for 
 Peking Opera to become the quintessence of Chinese culture.

656
00:39:58,680 --> 00:39:59,760
If our ancestors

657
00:39:59,760 --> 00:40:01,160
had not had the courage

658
00:40:01,400 --> 00:40:03,840
to reform and innovate,

659
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:06,080
there would not have been like

660
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:07,840
numerous flowers blossoming together,

661
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:10,640
and Peking Opera would not have flourished.

662
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,440
Can you be compared to the ancestors?

663
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,440
Not now.

664
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,880
But not in the future.

665
00:40:21,160 --> 00:40:23,160
The Shandengting Troupe,

666
00:40:23,160 --> 00:40:24,880
which I am from, is a hundred-year-old troupe.

667
00:40:25,120 --> 00:40:26,560
It was once so popular

668
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:28,160
that people flocked to it

669
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,480
and couldn't get a ticket.

670
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,840
But what about now?

671
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:33,640
The only audience are older viewers.

672
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,240
Even when

673
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,520
it was invited to a school play,

674
00:40:38,720 --> 00:40:39,880
the students

675
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:42,000
found every excuse to avoid it.

676
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:44,360
Are we going to hold it high above our heads

677
00:40:44,720 --> 00:40:45,520
in

678
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,400
such circumstances?

679
00:40:46,400 --> 00:40:48,040
It seems that

680
00:40:48,920 --> 00:40:50,360
people can crush Peking Opera

681
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,040
just by looking at it.

682
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,200
If people touch it,

683
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:54,960
it'll be dirty.

684
00:40:55,080 --> 00:40:57,080
So how is this art going to be passed down?

685
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,640
Beijing Opera is a traditional art,

686
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:01,760
but

687
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:04,720
I think more people need to know it,

688
00:41:04,720 --> 00:41:06,680
accept it and like it.

689
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:09,600
In this way,

690
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,520
the art is likely to be passed on.

691
00:41:12,960 --> 00:41:14,400
I go to Talking Stage.

692
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,080
If with such an opportunity,

693
00:41:16,080 --> 00:41:17,880
more young people can like it,

694
00:41:18,360 --> 00:41:19,640
know it and accept it, I think I will not lose anything.

695
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:30,920
Mr. Nan.

696
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:37,200
I have a quick temper.

697
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:40,840
Child,

698
00:41:41,480 --> 00:41:42,720
Use that

699
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:44,160
little rebellion

700
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,360
on the stage.

701
00:41:49,040 --> 00:41:50,440
I usually found you

702
00:41:50,440 --> 00:41:52,360
talking least in training,

703
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,360
I did not expect

704
00:41:53,360 --> 00:41:54,800
your small mouth

705
00:41:54,800 --> 00:41:56,200
to be quite able to talk.

706
00:41:57,560 --> 00:41:58,720
Since you are going there,

707
00:41:58,720 --> 00:42:00,080
show yourself there.

708
00:42:00,720 --> 00:42:01,720
You can't say anything worse there

709
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:04,040
than what you just said to me.

710
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:06,680
You're going to give our industry

711
00:42:06,680 --> 00:42:09,240
a good show.

712
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:14,840
You have a foot injury.

713
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,840
Don't be too brave.

714
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:19,680
If you get hurt again, you'll miss the training.
