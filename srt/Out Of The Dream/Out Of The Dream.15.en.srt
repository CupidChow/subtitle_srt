[Episode 15]

4
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:58,160
How could this happen?

5
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,640
I'm sorry, Mr. Fang.

6
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,360
I'll compensate you at the original price.

7
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:04,400
Mr. Bai.

8
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:05,720
Sorry.

9
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:19,079
I'll pay for this doll,

10
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:21,240
as a present to Miss Yu at our first meeting.

11
00:02:22,079 --> 00:02:24,800
Mr. Bai, this doll is one of the set.

12
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:27,440
And it's our boss's collection,

13
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:28,520
not for sale.

14
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,040
Not for sale?

15
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:33,560
Then where did Liu buy it?

16
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,160
Well…

17
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:36,920
How many dolls are there in this set?

18
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:38,840
Give me a price. I'll buy them all.

19
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,640
Please let Liu send them to Miss Yu's home.

20
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:42,000
No… Mr. Bai.

21
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,600
I've already caused you such trouble.

22
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:45,880
I can't accept them.

23
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:51,480
Miss Yu, I believe you appreciate arts better than me,

24
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:53,480
so you deserve it.

25
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:58,000
It was me who broke it…

26
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:02,800
Mr. Bai,

27
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:04,720
we've contacted with our boss.

28
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:06,560
He said,

29
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,320
sorry

30
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,360
for snubbing your friend.

31
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:13,040
There's another doll like this in our shop.

32
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:16,040
We can send it to this lady as a gift.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,320
Mr. Bai,

34
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:21,079
I know this doll must be expensive.

35
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:24,040
Certainly, I'm unable to pay such a huge amount of money.

36
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,120
But I'll surely pay you back one day.

37
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:28,400
Bring it to us now.

38
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:30,320
Fetch it.

39
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:36,480
Did you get hurt?

40
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,000
Mr. Bai,

41
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:44,280
it's me who caused this trouble.

42
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:46,000
I won't shirk the responsibility.

43
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:48,000
As for what you're going to give me,

44
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,560
I really can't accept it.

45
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,240
Mr. Bai, please have a look at it.

46
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,600
It doesn't seem like something so precious to me.

47
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,640
Artists just like to be pretentious.

48
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:11,120
I think the creator's only half as talented as he or she shows.

49
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,280
And plus the pride coming from nowhere.

50
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:15,880
It suddenly gives he or she confidence.

51
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,120
What limited or collected edition.

52
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:21,360
I've heard a lot about this kind of promotion terms.

53
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,480
It's just for better price.

54
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,720
But, suitable buyers and sellers

55
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:30,360
right have the chance to utilize each other.

56
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,440
Even in business,

57
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:34,080
it's also a rare occasion.

58
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:38,200
Miss Yu, it's no more than a ceramic doll.

59
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,200
Just accept it.

60
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,000
No need to feel stressed.

61
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,720
I don't want it.

62
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:45,520
Miss Yu,

63
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:48,360
you're quite like an artist.

64
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:49,840
However,

65
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:51,920
you only have half of

66
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,600
that surplus pride.

67
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:08,360
Here's my contact information.

68
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,040
Thank you for your kindness.

69
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:12,560
But no matter whether they're artworks or not,

70
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:14,560
and no matter how much their collection value is,

71
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,000
they all deserve to be cherished.

72
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
And no one could price them.

73
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:27,960
Mr. Fang,

74
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:30,400
come to tidy this up, please.

75
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:32,000
Okay, got it.

76
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:38,240
Feili, see?

77
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:41,440
It's the same for the contract this afternoon.

78
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640
I hope you can understand it.

79
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:45,400
Don't waste the situation we achieved between us.

80
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,640
What's more,

81
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:48,600
about the accident today,

82
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,640
this is my present for Miss Yu.

83
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,120
Please send it to her for me.

84
00:06:02,320 --> 00:06:03,920
In your heart,

85
00:06:04,640 --> 00:06:06,360
how much am I worth?

86
00:06:08,520 --> 00:06:09,840
And what about my mom?

87
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:14,040
Did she start to lose value

88
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:16,480
from 27 years ago to today?

89
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:23,200
I almost forgot.

90
00:06:23,200 --> 00:06:24,760
Today is your birthday.

91
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:26,000
Happy birthday.

92
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,440
Seems like you're not good at

93
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,480
being either a buyer

94
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,440
or a collector.

95
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:39,760
Auntie Feng,

96
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:42,159
Yu Fei is polite and well educated,

97
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,320
so she could tolerate you for so long at the table today.

98
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,560
But as your son,

99
00:06:49,200 --> 00:06:51,040
I'm neither polite

100
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
nor well-educated.

101
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:55,960
About the investment,

102
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,400
who's the benefactor and who's the beneficiary,

103
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:00,840
we both know it clearly.

104
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,640
This doll…

105
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,640
Let me buy it for you.

106
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:09,920
After all, a present

107
00:07:09,920 --> 00:07:11,640
should match its receiver.

108
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,640
You prefer

109
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,600
broken things, right?

110
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,640
I'll ask Mr. Fang to pack these pieces

111
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,080
and send them to Bai's mansion.

112
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:40,560
Juyuan,

113
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,320
today's kids are all impertinent like him.

114
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:47,480
What the hell.

115
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:48,800
So embarrassing!

116
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,360
It's a dead end!

117
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:02,560
I'll meet them again if I go back.

118
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,200
Forget about it…

119
00:08:10,480 --> 00:08:12,200
No one is looking at me now.

120
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:30,160
Ouch…

121
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:34,840
Who's there?

122
00:08:36,440 --> 00:08:37,520
Girl, whose child are you?

123
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,520
Stop it!

124
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:40,880
She's my girl.

125
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,400
Then take care of your kid!

126
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:44,200
Why do you let her out so late at night?

127
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:47,000
What the hell…

128
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,600
Today's people

129
00:08:48,600 --> 00:08:50,120
are really ill-behaved.

130
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:52,520
Come to help me!

131
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,200
Didn't you promise me

132
00:08:59,200 --> 00:09:01,280
that you wouldn't leave without saying anything again?

133
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:07,120
Okay. Bye-bye!

134
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,520
Is it enough? Bye!

135
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:15,200
You said you would celebrate my birthday today, didn't you?

136
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,720
We even haven't eaten the birthday cake! Are you running away now?

137
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:21,120
Let's give it a rain check.

138
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:25,960
Then can you help me ask Yu Fei

139
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,800
why she is so angry?

140
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:32,440
Because

141
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:35,040
she screwed everything up.

142
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:42,680
Then could you please tell her

143
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:45,480
that I'm so proud

144
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,200
to have such a girlfriend like her?

145
00:09:51,520 --> 00:09:53,840
She has nothing that you could be proud of.

146
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,360
I am proud.

147
00:09:59,960 --> 00:10:02,000
I heard that she made amazing progress

148
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:04,320
in English learning.

149
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,080
Is it because she went to study in the western restaurant with someone?

150
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,240
Come on.

151
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:17,560
His cost performance is super low.

152
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:21,240
Luckily she was arduous and diligent,

153
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:23,440
and made her cost worthwhile.

154
00:10:29,080 --> 00:10:31,000
I went to have a meal with the girl I love.

155
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:32,880
I didn't expect her

156
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:34,520
to memorize

157
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:35,920
the entire menu in English.

158
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,000
It was quite an unforgettable experience.

159
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,400
I did it for I wanted to have a look at your world.

160
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:48,800
Let's eat the cake now.

161
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,000
What the hell is it?

162
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,120
-I want to try it. -No…

163
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:08,240
Come on.

164
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:15,840
Delicious!

165
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:16,520
Give it a try?

166
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:18,280
It can't be delicious! All right…

167
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:19,280
It's finished.

168
00:11:19,280 --> 00:11:20,440
That's it.

169
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,280
Why is it totally different from my imagination?

170
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:30,760
Then let me

171
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,760
sing a song for you?

172
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:35,280
Good!

173
00:11:46,640 --> 00:12:00,760
Happy birthday to you! Happy birthday to you!

174
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:26,210
♫ Canoe adrift on the sea ♫

175
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,240
Let's go to hide!

176
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:26,160
Come down!

177
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:26,960
Quickly!

178
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,610
♫ Or wind across the forest ♫

179
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,600
Come to play!

180
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,480
What are you going to do?

181
00:12:31,690 --> 00:12:34,770
♫ Fury against kindness ♫

182
00:12:35,910 --> 00:12:39,900
♫ Crowds are silent but also turbulent ♫

183
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,230
♫ Time flies and life is transient ♫

184
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:49,150
♫ We don't have much time to hesitate ♫

185
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:53,640
♫ I won't let you go ♫

186
00:12:54,300 --> 00:12:58,330
♫ Like a beast breaking out of the cage ♫

187
00:12:58,360 --> 00:13:02,840
♫ Rushing through the winding river and against the roaring wind ♫

188
00:13:03,030 --> 00:13:07,740
♫ Even if I shout in despair ♫

189
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,950
♫ The hidden pain of the past ♫

190
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:16,560
Right,

191
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:18,480
Shang&Shan Group Fund

192
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,160
has officially decided to invest in our project.

193
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:23,000
So from now on, whether it's an epic script

194
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:24,600
or an orchestra,

195
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,280
we can do whatever we want.

196
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:28,760
Then did they put forward any excessive demand?

197
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:32,480
No script rewriting, no ad placement.

198
00:13:36,120 --> 00:13:38,320
So are we making it successful?

199
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,240
Not yet.

200
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,680
I feel we still need

201
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,240
to expand our influence.

202
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,400
At least,

203
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:46,240
we should enter the top 20 clubs

204
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:48,200
of the primary election for network New Year's Eve gala.

205
00:13:52,960 --> 00:13:55,240
Then, what about after the battle?

206
00:13:55,240 --> 00:13:58,200
Jiubai's Weibo super topic has kept being hot.

207
00:13:58,200 --> 00:14:00,440
I'll also follow the promotion later.

208
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:01,640
Our members

209
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:02,840
haven't stopped preparing

210
00:14:02,840 --> 00:14:04,440
these days.

211
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:06,560
But there's only one problem.

212
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:10,200
When could we decide the leading actor?

213
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,680
Gui Deng…

214
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:19,240
I mean,

215
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,320
without the leading actor,

216
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,440
we can't

217
00:14:22,440 --> 00:14:24,480
carry out the work afterwards.

218
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:29,120
For the leading actor, I have a candidate list.

219
00:14:29,640 --> 00:14:30,800
I'll tell you

220
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:32,240
if here's any news.

221
00:14:32,720 --> 00:14:35,720
That you go play the role is much faster than what a list can do.

222
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:42,840
Well, I mean…

223
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:47,120
Yu Fei has been taking classes at home, right?

224
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:49,640
So she can't come to the studio frequently.

225
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,440
If you play the leading role,

226
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:54,520
you can teach her at home

227
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,960
while dating and exercising by the way.

228
00:14:58,960 --> 00:14:59,960
It's perfect.

229
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:03,160
You're more in need of a date!

230
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:05,760
Go participate in some activities after work.

231
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:07,200
My free ride service

232
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:08,760
is over from today on.

233
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,600
Stingy.

234
00:15:15,000 --> 00:15:16,600
I'm not stingy.

235
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:19,400
I'm going to pick up Yu Fei,

236
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:20,800
so we can't go the same road,

237
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,360
and it's less convenient.

238
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:26,280
Yu Fei, I may have a meeting this evening.

239
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:27,600
I'll be a little late.

240
00:15:32,160 --> 00:15:33,160
Let's go on.

241
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:38,520
Okay.

242
00:15:38,840 --> 00:15:40,920
This is the battle PPT

243
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:42,160
that I just finished.

244
00:15:42,360 --> 00:15:43,880
Look if it's okay.

245
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,720
I think this part has a little problem.

246
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:51,120
Would it be better

247
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:53,640
if we add some Chinoiserie elements on it?

248
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
Chocolate!

249
00:16:10,960 --> 00:16:11,720
I've seen you so many times

250
00:16:11,720 --> 00:16:13,400
on this bus!

251
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,560
I usually go to school and go back home by this bus.

252
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,200
Isn't your school on the other side?

253
00:16:21,960 --> 00:16:24,720
-I… -And don't lie to me that you're going

254
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:26,200
to your classmate's home, or to the clothing market

255
00:16:26,200 --> 00:16:27,960
for wholesale, okay?

256
00:16:31,520 --> 00:16:32,840
No lying,

257
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:34,960
and I just want to escort you home.

258
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,080
I want to escort Miss Guanjiu home,

259
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:41,880
every day.

260
00:17:19,599 --> 00:17:21,319
Where's my exam admission ticket?

261
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:32,560
Luckily I didn't lose you!

262
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:41,320
How did you come in?

263
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,000
Just by opening the door. Why are you here?

264
00:17:47,000 --> 00:17:48,080
This is my home!

265
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:51,080
So you remember it!

266
00:17:51,080 --> 00:17:52,360
Good timing.

267
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:53,480
Remember to charge the cleaning fee

268
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,480
once every week.

269
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,360
If I hadn't come frequently,

270
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:59,480
the dust in your room will almost be like haze.

271
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:06,240
Honestly, I thought this time you went to Suzhou,

272
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:07,960
you would stay there for about half a month.

273
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,120
Look at yourself!

274
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:11,800
As a girl, you always try to go beyond your capacity.

275
00:18:11,800 --> 00:18:13,360
Never did you say anything to me.

276
00:18:13,360 --> 00:18:14,480
Were it not for Hao Shi who informed me,

277
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:16,240
I even wouldn't know that such a big issue happened in your home.

278
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,840
I planned to go there to help.

279
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,600
Don't bother. Everything at home has been settled.

280
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,800
You don't need to worry about it.

281
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,040
That Bai helped you address it?

282
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,600
He has a name,

283
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:32,320
Bai Feili!

284
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,360
What were you two doing?

285
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:37,760
You went home to see your parents?

286
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,200
Well,

287
00:18:39,400 --> 00:18:41,480
he made my little aunt love him so much!

288
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:43,520
She's as unsophisticated as Hao Shi.

289
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,080
Yu Fei.

290
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:21,160
Yu Fei!

291
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:34,240
What?

292
00:19:34,600 --> 00:19:36,120
You'll never remember this, right?

293
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:39,320
I'm sorry…

294
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,520
I'm really busy with my exam these days.

295
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:43,000
I'll go buy a new one

296
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,160
from the market some days later.

297
00:19:45,160 --> 00:19:46,560
A much prettier one.

298
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:48,840
Just in case,

299
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,200
please keep it at your home these days.

300
00:19:50,200 --> 00:19:51,160
Can you?

301
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,800
Are you busy with the exam or dating your boyfriend?

302
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,040
Why do you come back so late?

303
00:20:00,680 --> 00:20:02,680
You didn't answer my phone, nor did you reply to my message.

304
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:06,480
I thought you ran into trouble!

305
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,920
Sorry,

306
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:13,320
I was too busy to check my phone.

307
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:14,680
Nothing happened.

308
00:20:14,680 --> 00:20:16,360
Then why didn't you come back since nothing happened?

309
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,400
I have some private affairs.

310
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,440
It's not just band-aids you've forgotten.

311
00:20:21,920 --> 00:20:24,440
What do you mean? What else did I forget?

312
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:27,960
It's the 18th anniversary of our acquaintance.

313
00:20:31,160 --> 00:20:32,680
You really love him?

314
00:20:43,560 --> 00:20:44,880
Wang Zhongqiang.

315
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,480
Do you…

316
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,480
Do you love me?

317
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:06,200
Why is the screen of your computer black?

318
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,240
Is it how your lock screen looks like?

319
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:08,800
Is its power off?

320
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,280
Don't try to change the topic!

321
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,280
Hey, I didn't!

322
00:21:14,840 --> 00:21:18,000
To… To avoid the truth of the exam result,

323
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,320
you're talking nonsense

324
00:21:19,480 --> 00:21:20,440
like that I love you,

325
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:22,640
which will possibly end our friendship.

326
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,400
Good, I was scared.

327
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:31,120
What's going on with this computer?

328
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:34,280
Is my host going wrong?

329
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:37,120
Is it burned?

330
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,960
It's on. It's working now.

331
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,880
It's definitely due to poor contact.

332
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,880
All right, check your exam result now.

333
00:21:49,600 --> 00:21:51,360
No, I'm a bit nervous.

334
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:52,480
I dare not to check it.

335
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,440
Come on, hurry up!

336
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:56,400
Then what if I fail?

337
00:21:56,680 --> 00:21:58,000
I am here with you.

338
00:21:58,240 --> 00:21:59,280
Come on!

339
00:22:01,360 --> 00:22:02,760
Input the number of my admission ticket first.

340
00:22:02,760 --> 00:22:03,760

344
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:18,840
I passed the exam! Marvelous!

345

Don't worry,

[Bai Who Will Definitely Come Back]

350
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:35,840
Hello, Bai Feili! I'll give you…

351
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,320
Well, I wanna ask you

352
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:42,760
if you're hungry or not.

353
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,000
If you are,

354
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:48,360
I'll make you mare dishes tonight.

355
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:50,600
What do you want to eat?

356
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,920
Is there any dish you want to eat?

357
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:56,880
Okay.

358
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
Then I'll go buy ingredients later,

359
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,000
and then return home.

360
00:23:04,880 --> 00:23:05,840
Bye-bye.

He's gone?

364
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,480
Remember to water the flowers.

What the hell is it?

369
00:23:50,640 --> 00:23:53,840
There are many things hard to say in your life,

370
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,560
while "I love you" is not one of them.

371
00:23:58,600 --> 00:24:00,480
But, well…

372
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,240
Only company of friends

373
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:03,560
can last forever.

Isn't it good enough?

00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,400
Right.

376
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:12,320
As an old saying goes, for everything in this world,

377
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:13,920
once you're eager to own it,

378
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,120
it'll just bloom like a flower.

379
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:17,920
But once you have it,

380
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:19,720
it'll start to wither.

Different people have their own ways of living.

"As the old saying goes"…

I don't understand these literary words at all.

384

Those who can understand my words

00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:33,040
are all masters.

Cook the dinner now!

392
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,600
Africa is really interesting.

393
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,520
The only problem is our eating habit.

394
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:40,400
I just missed Chinese dishes so much when we were abroad,

395
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,120
n-no matter what.

396
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:44,800
Then boil more rice tonight.

397
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:50,680
Okay, I'm going to cook.

398
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,800
After all, except cooking,

399
00:25:52,800 --> 00:25:54,280
I can't do anything well.

400
00:25:55,640 --> 00:25:57,240
I want fried rice with eggs!

401
00:25:57,920 --> 00:26:00,080
Scrambled eggs with tomatoes, and tomato soup with eggs.

402
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,160
I want them all!

403
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

404
00:26:03,800 --> 00:26:05,360
Since it's the feast of eggs,

405
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:06,800
I want the steamed egg custard.

406
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:10,640
Steamed egg custard…

407
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,200

No way!

See he's drunk.

411
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:02,160
If he sees what he looks like after he wakes up…

412
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,720
What on earth is that?

413
00:27:08,040 --> 00:27:09,640
So much luggage?

414
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:10,920
Let me tidy this up for you.

415
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:13,000
Oh, thank you.

416
00:27:18,680 --> 00:27:19,960
There's something

417
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:21,720
that they don't need to play.

418
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:25,560
Social news is to show the social phenomena.

419
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,640
Yu Fei, what happened?

420
00:27:37,640 --> 00:27:39,200
Allergic to air?

421
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:40,320
Have caught a cold?

422
00:27:41,920 --> 00:27:44,760
Yu Fei, is it the 25th today?

423
00:27:45,640 --> 00:27:46,680
Yes!

424
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,720
The 25th, right?

425
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:50,440
Oh, I'm jet-lagged!

426
00:27:50,440 --> 00:27:50,920
The 25th.

427
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:53,520
We have a seminar the day after tomorrow, right?

428
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,520
Did you forget it?

429
00:27:54,520 --> 00:27:55,800
Come on! Check it!

430
00:27:55,800 --> 00:27:57,240
Hurry up, the notepad in your phone!

431
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:58,520
Have a look at your notepad.

432
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,840
The Seminar… How can I forget it?

433
00:28:00,840 --> 00:28:01,960
I've kept it in mind!

434
00:28:01,960 --> 00:28:04,680
Look at this. It doesn't work, right?

435
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,200
We're not used to what today's youngsters are using.

436
00:28:11,320 --> 00:28:13,920
Yu Fei, are you not feeling well with your throat?

437
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Right, are you not feeling well?

438
00:28:16,400 --> 00:28:17,520
Nope…

439
00:28:18,280 --> 00:28:19,400
You…

440
00:28:19,720 --> 00:28:21,600
Why are you acting sort of weirdly today?

441
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:24,000
Right, q-quite weird.

442
00:28:27,080 --> 00:28:29,080
Are you…

443
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:39,240
Are you

444
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:41,400
making rice burned?

445
00:28:43,400 --> 00:28:45,080
Impossible! No.

446
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,320
She hasn't cooked yet! No way.

447
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:47,440
N-no.

448
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,040
I made you burned!

449
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:05,680
Come on…

450
00:29:06,440 --> 00:29:07,360
-Well… -See?

451
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,680
T-this was shot that day.

452
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:10,240
That day, right?

453
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:11,880
Do you know what plain it is, huh?

454
00:29:11,880 --> 00:29:13,280
Nope, I can't remember it.

455
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:13,920
Maybe, Er… Er…

00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,640

00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:23,760
And you!

460
00:29:24,600 --> 00:29:27,080
My exam result has come out today.

461
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:29,840
Do you remember it?

462
00:29:30,840 --> 00:29:32,800
Yes, we remember it!

463
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:34,680
I…

464
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,200
Then,

465
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,440
don't be too sad.

466
00:29:40,160 --> 00:29:42,680
Come on, take some braised Dongpo pork.

467
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:46,360
Victory and defeat are both common in battle!

468
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:47,480
If you're really sad,

469
00:29:47,480 --> 00:29:48,720
just go cry for a while!

470
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,120
We'll eat, and you can feel free to cry.

471
00:29:50,120 --> 00:29:51,560
-Right, you can cry. -We'll just pretend that we didn't see it.

472
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,600
No, I…

473
00:29:52,600 --> 00:29:55,400
Right, you still have the chance next year.

474
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,280
Besides, as your instructor,

475
00:29:57,280 --> 00:29:59,040
I'll hold responsible for you.

476

Right… He'll be responsible for you.

477
00:30:00,760 --> 00:30:03,520
-Yes. -What next year? I…

478
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:06,240
Yeah, your foundation is not that good.

479
00:30:06,720 --> 00:30:08,360
Maybe two years, or three years later,

480
00:30:08,360 --> 00:30:09,680
your study will still not bring you any result.

481
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:11,600
Learning is an endless road.

482
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:12,680
So is the exam.

483
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:15,280
It doesn't matter even if you could never make it.

484
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,080
You can stay in the Zhan Garden,

485
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:19,280
helping your husband, bringing up children and working on domestic chores.

486
00:30:19,280 --> 00:30:20,560
Right?

487
00:30:20,760 --> 00:30:22,240
I've already prepared

488
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:24,000
the study materials for you.

489
00:30:24,600 --> 00:30:27,200
Bai Feili! Am I that stupid

490
00:30:27,200 --> 00:30:28,560
in your heart?

491
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:32,320
Yes. Why don't you open your gift now?

492
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,600
Open it to have a look!

We knew that you made it!

498
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,040
Let's start the party!

499
00:31:08,040 --> 00:31:11,520
the coolest discotheque in the world!

500
00:31:12,440 --> 00:31:13,160
Come on!

501
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,240
I don't know how to dance.

502
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,520
You can! Just follow me.

503
00:31:33,240 --> 00:31:34,440
In front of me,

504
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:37,440
are scenes that I once hated.

505
00:31:38,800 --> 00:31:41,520
Because I was afraid that behind all the surprises,

506
00:31:41,520 --> 00:31:43,880
there was transient happiness.

507
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:46,240
What accompanied me forever

508
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:49,000
was the floor of the rehearsal room.

509
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:50,640
Uncle's high requirement,

510

511
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:57,720
Are you happy?

512
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:00,160
Thank you.

513
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:02,560
I want another sentence.

514
00:32:05,240 --> 00:32:06,640
Keep dreaming!

515
00:32:10,680 --> 00:32:12,440
I didn't expect that I could meet you.

516
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,920
I could stop waiting for that sentence,

517
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:16,280
"You're so great."

518
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:18,320
Finally I could be

519
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,480
the first one to raise the wine glass and cheer.

520
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:26,160
Finally I have a family to toast with.

521
00:32:29,720 --> 00:32:31,560
Mom!

522
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,760
I made it!

523
00:32:34,560 --> 00:32:36,800
I will return to the stage!

524
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,600
And I'll be a famous opera actress!

525
00:32:39,040 --> 00:32:42,000
You can make it even louder.

526
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,520
And then we'll receive complaints from our neighbors.

527
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:47,960
Come on, open it.

528
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:49,440
Let's celebrate it.

529
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,440
Okay!

530
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:55,480
This time, you and Mr. Shang have helped me a lot.

531
00:32:58,840 --> 00:33:00,160
If you asked me,

532
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:02,680
I think Mr. Bai is the one you should thank most.

533
00:33:03,040 --> 00:33:04,400
I've never seen him

534
00:33:04,400 --> 00:33:06,840
so caring about any girl.

535
00:33:07,280 --> 00:33:08,760
Well,

536
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:10,200
Mr. Shang and I

537
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:11,680
are both teachers.

538
00:33:12,520 --> 00:33:14,240
But our daughter

539
00:33:14,240 --> 00:33:17,120
didn't live as we expected.

540
00:33:17,560 --> 00:33:18,880
In the end,

541
00:33:19,120 --> 00:33:22,200
she turned out to a kind of failure

542
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:23,880
in the worldly view.

543
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:26,520
After she passed away,

544
00:33:26,720 --> 00:33:28,480
Feili started to stay with us.

545
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:31,520
We look quite free and easy in normal times,

546
00:33:32,040 --> 00:33:34,480
but I'm worried indeed.

547
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:36,520
I don't know

548
00:33:36,520 --> 00:33:37,840
whether I could cultivate Feili

549
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:40,760
to be a healthy adult.

550
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,320
But since your appearance,

551
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:46,600
we've been rest assured.

552
00:33:46,920 --> 00:33:48,080
Only if a person truly

553
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,680
falls in love with another one,

554
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,600
can he be attached to this world.

555
00:33:52,600 --> 00:33:53,600
Right?

556
00:33:57,800 --> 00:33:59,160
But,

557
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,720
sometimes I'm also scared.

558
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:03,320
I think…

559
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,320
I know.

560
00:34:05,080 --> 00:34:06,560
Why me?

561
00:34:06,560 --> 00:34:08,000
And why him?

562
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,000
You're still young.

563
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Only you youngsters

564
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:15,960
will have this kind of

565
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:18,239
panic because of happiness.

566
00:34:19,239 --> 00:34:21,480
So you should cherish it more.

567
00:34:22,199 --> 00:34:24,040
When you're at my age,

568
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,360
even if the sky falls down,

569
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,520
we just won't panic.

570
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,639
It's because you've found

571
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,840
the one who makes you feel at ease, isn't it?

572
00:34:34,639 --> 00:34:37,440
Shan! I got my back hurt again!

573
00:34:37,440 --> 00:34:39,000
-Come to help me! -See?

574
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:40,600

575
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,600
I just hope he can make less trouble.

576

578

Family is who you have to love,

579
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,440
right?

580
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:53,280

Bai Feili,

584
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:53,360
I'm super happy today!

585
00:35:53,360 --> 00:35:56,840
Because today I'm really lucky.

586
00:35:57,240 --> 00:35:58,160
I planned

587
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:00,520
to take only one sip.

588
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:04,240
But, it asked me

589
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:06,400
to have one more bottle.

590
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:09,040
So I just drank another one.

591
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,720
And it was "one more bottle" again!

592
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:16,160
After I continued to take one bottle again,

593
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:17,640
it was

594
00:36:17,920 --> 00:36:20,680
still "one more bottle"!

595
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:22,920
So I finished

596
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:24,760
all these.

597
00:36:25,400 --> 00:36:27,920
And there's still "one more bottle" left!

598
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,800
What should I do?

599
00:36:30,040 --> 00:36:32,200
I can't hold anymore.

600
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:36,240
Be careful.

601
00:36:50,400 --> 00:36:54,360
I once had a dream,

602
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,080
where there was a

603
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:59,640
magnificent lion.

604
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,200
It ran to me,

605
00:37:05,080 --> 00:37:07,960
and when I was just going to avoid it,

606
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:12,400
it lifted me up in one swoop.

607
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:15,280
Really?

608
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:21,400
Are you that lion?

609
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,720
Actually,

610
00:37:28,000 --> 00:37:29,400
I

611
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,440
am also afraid of many things.

612

I don't know whether I could protect you well.

613

I'm not a baby,

614
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,360
and you're also not a diaper.

615
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:47,920
Why must you protect me?

616
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:54,520
Besides, I can also be your protector.

617

00:43:19,000 --> 00:43:20,720
Lingjiu just sent a video,

682
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:22,800
declaring the cease of cooperation with Feiwo.

683
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:24,400
What's more,

684
00:43:25,160 --> 00:43:26,880
Zhuang Sheng, that traitor,

685
00:43:26,880 --> 00:43:28,600
he's gone to help Li Hentian!
