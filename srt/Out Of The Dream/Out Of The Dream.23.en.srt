Yu Fei, Miss Yu,

00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:40,480
is still a student,

46
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:41,240
but

47
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:43,920
she's been representing the new generation of Beijing Opera,

48
00:04:43,920 --> 00:04:45,480
particularly recommended by

49
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,200
the cast of "Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period".

50
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,080
In the younger generation,

51
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:53,320
she's the best female singer of senior male roles,

52
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:54,560
which is rare.

53
00:04:55,480 --> 00:04:58,280
She grew up in an opera troupe,

54
00:04:58,440 --> 00:04:59,640
working on Beijing Opera,

55
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:00,880

I also want to ask Miss Yu,

489
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,800
do you think

art

491
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:10,640

It's not the topic that

but the topic that

495
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,560
I would like to discuss more with Miss Yu.

496
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:27,040
In my opinion,

pure art

498
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,160

Is pure art independent?

500
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:34,040
Sure.

501
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:38,320
How does pure art with providers become independent?

502
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:47,720
As long as the will of the creator

503
00:24:48,120 --> 00:24:49,600
is not controlled by the provider,

504
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:51,040
then it's independent.

505
00:24:51,680 --> 00:24:53,880
Providers will only make offerings if they want something.

506
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,760
Since they want something,

507
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:57,960

you'll regret it.

683
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,080
Allow us to be broken.

♫ I won't let you go ♫

685
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:38,880

♫ Like a beast breaking out of the cage ♫

Don't be afraid of being broken.

702
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:12,880
There's more than one path,

703
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,640
and more than one destination.

704
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:19,120
Don't compare yourself to others.

705
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:20,960
You won't be Queen Dong.

706
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:22,480
You won't be anyone else.

707
00:32:24,680 --> 00:32:25,600
You are yourself.

708
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:48,720
Hello, whose order?

709
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,440
Mine.

710
00:32:49,640 --> 00:32:50,560
Please enjoy your meal.

711
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:54,000
[Super Assorted Dish]

712
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:52,280
You ordered it?

713
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:54,400
Who has allowed you to drink, you little tyke!

714
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:56,360
Who's a tyke?

715
00:32:58,280 --> 00:32:59,320
You see it?

716
00:32:59,640 --> 00:33:00,800
I'm Hao Shi.

717
00:33:00,800 --> 00:33:01,760
Male.

718
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:02,880
From Jiangsu province.

719
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:04,400
I'm an adult.

720
00:33:06,600 --> 00:33:08,040
Fine. Let's drink it.

721
00:33:21,680 --> 00:33:23,800
I don't know what's going on with boss lately.

722
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,080
Everyone is so serious these days.

723
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:27,920
He's still so fierce every day.

724
00:33:28,560 --> 00:33:30,160
And you saw what happened just now.

725
00:33:30,360 --> 00:33:32,000
He dared to do that to my sister.

726
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:34,680
He was the one who broke up with my sister.

727
00:33:36,240 --> 00:33:38,280
Because he's an adult.

728
00:33:40,080 --> 00:33:41,280
So what?

729
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:42,400
Are adults

730
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:44,280
supposed to become the people

731
00:33:44,520 --> 00:33:46,680
they used to hate the most?

732
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,280
When Chocolate joined Jiubai,

733
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:53,040
he said he loved making clothes.

734
00:33:53,280 --> 00:33:55,040
and took to comics.

735
00:33:55,480 --> 00:33:56,520
Dress his favorite characters

736
00:33:56,520 --> 00:33:58,160
in the clothes he designed.

737
00:33:58,560 --> 00:33:59,680
This is your dream,

738
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:00,680
right?

739
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:05,240
Now my dream becomes bigger.

740
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:08,000
I wish

741
00:34:08,199 --> 00:34:10,360
I would make every beautiful dress

742
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:11,600
Guanjiu wears.

743
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:14,520
But what if I don't like you?

744
00:34:15,239 --> 00:34:16,440
Whatever you do,

745
00:34:16,440 --> 00:34:17,960
I won't like you.

746
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,840
Will you give up on your own dream?

747
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:23,400
I don't know.

748
00:34:25,760 --> 00:34:27,639
But I'm sure it would hurt.

749
00:34:29,719 --> 00:34:31,120
If I just give up my dream

750
00:34:31,120 --> 00:34:33,360
because you don't like me.

751
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:35,679
I don't think it matters.

752
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,239
After all, if this blow

753
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:40,880
is counted a level 10,

754
00:34:42,159 --> 00:34:44,159
giving up my dream is just a level 9.

755
00:34:46,199 --> 00:34:47,840
This is the dream.

756
00:34:47,960 --> 00:34:49,520
A word sounds nice

757
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:51,600
but not light.

758
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,000
A person's dream is very heavy.

759
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:55,840
Guanshan carrying the dream

760
00:34:55,840 --> 00:34:57,280
of Jiubai and running forward

761
00:34:57,480 --> 00:34:58,680
must be saddled with heaviness

762
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,840
that you and I can't feel.

763
00:35:03,640 --> 00:35:05,280
But he's an adult

764
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:07,760
who's been on this path for a while.

765
00:35:08,360 --> 00:35:09,840
He met people like Gui Deng

766
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:11,840
who could only unload their dreams

767
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:13,960
because the reality blocked their ways.

768
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,320
He also met people like Li Hentian

769
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:18,080
who had to change themselves

770
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:20,800
in order to keep their dreams alive.

771
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:36,240
The more people he met along the way,

772
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:38,560
no matter they chose to or were forced to lose dreams,

773
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:40,400
the more he would

774
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,000
understand others' difficulties

775
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,280
and try to be worthy of others' persistence.

776
00:35:44,400 --> 00:35:45,680
To make people behind him

777
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:47,200
carry their own dreams

778
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:48,520
and go on,

779
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:50,360
To support Jiubai,

780
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,160
giving more people

781
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:53,640
a place to dream.

782
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:55,680
That's what adults are.

783
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:00,400
But why does he understand so many people,

784
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,600
but not understand you?

785
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:16,800
It's not that he doesn't understand me.

786
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,440
He just doesn't love me.

787
00:36:21,480 --> 00:36:23,080
It's not his fault.

788
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:30,160
What about me?

789
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,240
I must have drunk too much.

790
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:49,280
I mean little boy,

791
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:50,400
come on.

792
00:36:51,000 --> 00:36:51,840
Today,

793
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,960
let me

794
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:54,800
give you a blow

795
00:36:54,920 --> 00:36:56,360
of alcohol.

796
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,280
Come on.

797
00:37:08,040 --> 00:37:09,360
So today,

798
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,080
can I

799
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:15,120
make a little progress on my dream?

800
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:20,640
Where do you want to progress?

801
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,320
First, stop calling me little boy.

802
00:37:24,440 --> 00:37:25,760
OK, little boy.

803
00:37:26,960 --> 00:37:28,760
I said don't call me little boy.

804
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:30,800
Get it, little boy.

805
00:37:31,680 --> 00:37:33,480
You did it on purpose, right?

806
00:37:34,400 --> 00:37:35,000
Fine.

807
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,840
Today,

808
00:37:38,360 --> 00:37:41,000
just allow you to stride a little bit longer.

809
00:37:41,520 --> 00:37:42,560
From now on,

810
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:45,240
don't call me Guanjiu.

811
00:37:46,240 --> 00:37:47,240
Good.

812
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,840
Call me

813
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:51,360
an embodiment of beauty and intelligence,

814
00:37:51,360 --> 00:37:53,000
the prettiest programmer from Tsinghua University,

815
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:53,760
the guardian of Chinoiserie,

816
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,560
Queen Guanjiu.

817
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:57,600
Guanjiu, speak slowly.

818
00:37:57,600 --> 00:37:58,400
I almost forgot all.

819
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,520
Forget it, little boy.

820
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:01,760
Don't go any further. Let's drink.

821
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,200
Cheers.

822
00:38:07,640 --> 00:38:09,080
You played cool.

823
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:11,360
You put on airs.

824
00:38:12,440 --> 00:38:13,680
You didn't attend

825
00:38:13,800 --> 00:38:14,760
the victory banquet.

826
00:38:20,280 --> 00:38:21,960
What's the...

827
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:23,840
What's the big deal?

828
00:38:24,360 --> 00:38:26,240
I'm simply an ex-girlfriend.

829
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:28,560
You coward!

830
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,560
Break old rules to create new?

831
00:38:31,840 --> 00:38:32,520
What's the...

832
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:34,080
What's the stupid things?

833
00:38:38,440 --> 00:38:39,960
You still...

834
00:38:40,880 --> 00:38:43,480
You still care about me.

835
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:47,440
Why can't we just be together?

836
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,480
Oh my God!

837
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,720
Bai Feili, the kept man,

838
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,440
can really pull low tricks,

839
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:55,360
even on the female guest in the program.

840
00:38:55,360 --> 00:38:57,400
He dared to ride the wave of Lingjiu

841
00:38:57,600 --> 00:38:59,040
Tonight we're gonna snipe at this guy.

842
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,400
Done, I'll call right now.

843
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,240
Today, I'll be the snowflake in an avalanche,

844
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:05,440
involving everyone of his family.

845
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,200
What the hell!

846
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:12,280
Happy birthday.

847
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:14,480
You are

848
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
the female guest in Talking Stage.

849
00:39:16,920 --> 00:39:18,400
- That's me. 
- It's really her.

850
00:39:18,520 --> 00:39:19,280
What are you waiting for?

851
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:20,560
Take pictures. Hurry up.

852
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,800
Let me teach you.

853
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,120
It's fine

854
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:25,520
to play a double game in the screen.

855
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:26,720
Now you actually

856
00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:28,440
stand up for him offstage.

857
00:39:32,120 --> 00:39:33,280
Get away!

858
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,680
More food, and less curse.

859
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,120
Do you want to pick a fight?

860
00:39:43,400 --> 00:39:46,160
I've always wanted to teach you, you keyboard guys.

861
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:49,400
It happened that you're all together today.

862
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:51,960
Come on.

863
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:53,880
Guys,

864
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:55,040
give her what for!

865
00:40:01,480 --> 00:40:02,760
All you do

866
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,760
is stab others in the back,

867
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:09,360
casually typing some words online.

868
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:10,760
How much

869
00:40:11,080 --> 00:40:12,680
your casual words can hurt others,

870
00:40:12,680 --> 00:40:13,880
do you know?

871
00:40:14,360 --> 00:40:15,720
Without the shield of keyboard,

872
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:17,600
you're nothing.

873
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,560
Let me tell you.

874
00:40:20,120 --> 00:40:21,840
Bai Feili is not who you say

875
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:23,000
he is.

876
00:40:26,920 --> 00:40:28,280
He's the bravest

877
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,360
and the most responsible one

878
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:34,480
I've ever met.

879
00:40:36,920 --> 00:40:38,160
He carries

880
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:39,560
everyone's dream.

881
00:40:41,400 --> 00:40:42,480
No matter how tired

882
00:40:42,680 --> 00:40:43,920
or stressed he is,

883
00:40:44,960 --> 00:40:46,360
he will run on.

884
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:50,360
He is

885
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,080
really

886
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:53,480
a very very good...

887
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:57,600
That's it.

888
00:40:58,240 --> 00:40:59,600
Stop now.
