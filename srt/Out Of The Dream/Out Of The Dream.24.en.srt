[Out Of The Dream]

[Episode 24]

4
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:43,360
You guys!

5
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,520
How dare you bad mouth him!

6
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:48,000
I tell you

7
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,600
Bai Feili is not

8
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:51,800
that kind of person.

9
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,080
He's

10
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:00,800
the bravest

11
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:03,120
and the most responsible man I know.

12
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,520
He shoulders the burden

13
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:08,280
of everyone's dream.

14
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:11,000
No matter how tired he is,

15
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,480
and how heavy the burden is,

16
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,120
he will stick through.

17
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:18,840
He

18
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,400
is really really nice...

19
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,120
Okay.

20
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,800
Enough.

21
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,120
I'll make up for

22
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,920
all the losses today.

23
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,880
You can reach me by calling

24
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,160
or finding me in person.

25
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:49,040
I won't get away with it.

26
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:57,760
Let's go.

27
00:02:57,760 --> 00:02:58,640
Let's go home.

28
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,840
Be careful!

29
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,040
Is it you?

30
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,440
Are you here

31
00:03:34,760 --> 00:03:37,120
to pick me up?

32
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,920
Why are you in my dream again?

33
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:46,320
Don't come again.

34
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:03,120
Don't...

35
00:04:03,520 --> 00:04:04,520
Stop.

36
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:07,080
I come to drive you home.

37
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:11,240
Which home?

38
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:15,880
Our home.

39
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,120
You are better

40
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,360
in my dreams.

41
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,640
Why?

42
00:06:12,760 --> 00:06:14,040
Why?

43
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:18,040
Just a dream.

44
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:32,640
Did I still

45
00:06:35,640 --> 00:06:37,320
let you down in your dreams?

46
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:43,640
I'll apologize to you.

47
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,600
If you're still mad,

48
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,520
you can let me down in my dream.

49
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:58,480
During this period,

50
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,080
I wished upon your star everyday,

51
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:06,440
hoping that you'd show up in my dream.

52
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:09,800
But you never did.

53
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:14,600
Before knowing you,

54
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:19,120
I never thought about missing someone.

55
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:31,200
Until you walked into my life,

56
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,400
I had someone to hang on to.

57
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
There seemed to be an instinct

58
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,280
telling me

59
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:44,480
if that girl runs away,

60
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:46,880
you have to go after her.

61
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:49,640
You always need to

62
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:52,920
stand somewhere visible when she turns around.

63
00:07:54,880 --> 00:07:56,320
I really hope that

64
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,960
time would froze when I hugged you.

65
00:08:07,920 --> 00:08:10,080
No matter how far she runs away,

66
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:12,440
I'll find her back.

67
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,160
From now on,

68
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,120
I will take care of

69
00:08:17,480 --> 00:08:18,800
Yu Fei forever.

70
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:21,920
I didn't keep my promise.

71
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:25,920
The stars and you

72
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:28,160
won't forgive me.

73
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,640
What are you doing here?

74
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,520
Last night,

75
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,280
Miss Guanjiu...

76
00:09:02,280 --> 00:09:04,520
Last night, you invited me to stay for breakfast.

77
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,880
The noodle isn't cooked well.

78
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:39,520
It's a bit hard,

79
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,520
Then

80
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,520
have an egg. Have an egg.

81
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,120
Miss Guanjiu, I finished.

82
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:18,280
Are you full?

83
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,080
Yes.

84
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,360
Then,

85
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:23,480
I need to get to class this morning.

86
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:25,600
I won't be able to leave with you.

87
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:33,120
Your t-shirt is inside out.

88
00:11:01,790 --> 00:11:06,430
♫ The smiling stars hop into the night, ♫

89
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,680
♫ meeting sweetly in the dream. ♫

90
00:11:11,450 --> 00:11:13,620
♫ The moonlight carries my miss. ♫

91
00:11:13,870 --> 00:11:17,590
♫ The lingering breeze and petals flush on the cheeks. ♫

92
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:20,820
♫ In peaceful sleep, ♫

93
00:11:21,170 --> 00:11:25,110
♫ I've fallen for you before I knew it. ♫

94
00:11:26,520 --> 00:11:30,150
♫ Do you have the same feeling? ♫

95
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,380
♫ Our distance is shrinking. ♫

96
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,840
♫ Our hearts are getting closer each day. ♫

97
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,960
Guan Zhijiu, Guan Zhijiu.

98
00:11:38,960 --> 00:11:40,880
What are you worrying about?

99
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,720
Nothing happened last night.

100
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,350
[Meeting today! Don't stay in bed!]

101
00:11:56,680 --> 00:11:57,320
Right.

102
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,360
I need to get to work today.

103
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:00,520
I can't die yet.

104
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:02,480
Guan Zhijiu.

105
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:03,800
Fighting!

106
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:53,280
She's still sleeping.

107
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:54,760
When are you done

108
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:55,880
fooling Yu Fei?

109
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:57,960
Since you don't love her,

110
00:12:58,160 --> 00:12:59,080
you should man up

111
00:12:59,080 --> 00:13:00,600
and let her go.

112
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,480
Rather than messing with me,

113
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,880
you should take good care of her.

114
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:50,440
Okay.

115
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:51,960
There's still time.

116
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:48,040
She got up.

117
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,160
Perfect timing.

118
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:56,760
Five

119
00:14:57,920 --> 00:14:58,640
Four

120
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,480
Three

121
00:15:01,280 --> 00:15:02,200
Two

122
00:15:03,080 --> 00:15:03,640
One

123
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:05,120
- Bai Feili. 
-I like you.

124
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,640
I like you Yu Fei.

125
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:30,840
Hear me out.

126
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:33,280
It's not a joke nor a game.

127
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,720
I really like you.

128
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:39,880
I like how cheerful you are

129
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:41,600
when you beat me.

130
00:15:42,760 --> 00:15:43,680
I like how you take it seriously

131
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:44,840
on stage.

132
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,960
I like how you never give up.

133
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:51,480
But what I like the most

134
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:54,600
is when you are happy.

135
00:15:58,440 --> 00:15:59,800
When you were in a relationship,

136
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:02,040
I was so upset.

137
00:16:02,520 --> 00:16:03,960
Even if I thought you weren't meant for each other,

138
00:16:03,960 --> 00:16:06,120
I was just staying by your side.

139
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:13,680
I worried that you might quarrel.

140
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:15,080
I was afraid that you could get hurt

141
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,520
and that I couldn't protect you anymore.

142
00:16:21,840 --> 00:16:22,640
Yu Fei

143
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:25,520
Somebody told me that

144
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:27,440
I must tell you how I feel today.

145
00:16:28,520 --> 00:16:29,360
It's

146
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:32,000
my biggest chance.

147
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:40,640
Although the time has passed,

148
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:43,720
I still want to tell you

149
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:45,640
I like you.

150
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:47,320
I want to be with you.

151
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,360
Not as a friend nor a brother,

152
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:55,360
but as a boyfriend

153
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:56,560
standing beside you.

154
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:06,450
♫ You're my whole world ♫

155
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:06,640
Dao Ge,

156
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:08,040
You...

157
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:12,660
♫ It's okay ♫

158
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:13,599
I've been keeping it to myself for so long.

159
00:17:13,030 --> 00:17:15,030
♫ My stranded heart ♫

160
00:17:13,599 --> 00:17:14,680
I finally said it.

161
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,869
♫ Love has been cooled down by the time ♫

162
00:17:19,720 --> 00:17:21,440
Take your time.

163

♫ After a few more worlds ♫

164
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:24,720
When you have thought about it,

165
00:17:23,740 --> 00:17:26,910
♫ I'm still here ♫

166
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,920
tell me your answer.

167
00:17:27,589 --> 00:17:30,200
♫ Hope the men you meet ♫

♫ All love you like I do ♫

169

♫ I once had you ♫

170
00:17:36,680 --> 00:17:40,910
♫ That's the reason why I miss you ♫

171
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:38,600
And

172
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,560
I want to know

173
00:17:41,270 --> 00:17:46,690
♫ Every effort is therefore worthwhile ♫

with me on the phone?

519
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:22,240
I need to talk face to face.

520
00:37:23,160 --> 00:37:24,800
We weren't even together.

521
00:37:25,360 --> 00:37:26,920
There is no breakup.

522
00:37:28,080 --> 00:37:29,400
I just thought

523
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,720
we should clarify the gossip.

524
00:37:32,600 --> 00:37:34,520
Why are you the one to decide?

525
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,040
You know about the public opinion online.

526
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:39,960
Your supporters don't like

527
00:37:39,960 --> 00:37:41,840
the idea that there's gossip between us.

528
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,000
If it goes on like this,

529
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:46,920
many people will unfollow you.

530
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:48,720
And

531
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:50,240
it will affect your film

532
00:37:50,240 --> 00:37:52,000
and commercials collaboration.

533
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:53,920
Right.

534
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:56,320
I care about my supporters

535
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:03,680
but I care more about you.

[The Shandengting troupe] [Peking opera]

537
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,280
Did you find those people?

538
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:16,320
No.

539
00:38:16,600 --> 00:38:17,680
I'm not that dumb.

540
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:20,640
Lower your head.

541
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,920
Let's run first and then talk.

542
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:36,400
Luckily, they didn't follow.

543
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:40,040
Thank you

544
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:41,720
Guanshan.

545
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:46,040
No need to thank me.

546
00:38:47,720 --> 00:38:49,360
Things have turned out this way.

547
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:51,760
I should be responsible for it.

548
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:53,920
You were protecting me just now.

549
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:55,800
Why are you

550
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,680
turning me down right now?

551
00:39:07,360 --> 00:39:08,640
Let's get married.
