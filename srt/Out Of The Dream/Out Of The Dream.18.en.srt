Originating from southern branch of opera in the Song and Yuan Dynasties,

the poetic dramas of Ming and Qing Dynasties

matured in the late Qing Dynasty,

and reached its peak in the early Anti-Japanese War.

89

for more than 800 years

91
00:07:58,040 --> 00:07:59,720
and is an important part of

92
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:01,000
traditional Chinese art.

93
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:04,560
From the Zaju of the Jin and Yuan Dynasties to the poetic dramas of the Ming and Qing Dynasties,

94
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,120
from the prosperity of Music And Opera Of Kunshan and Yiyang to Hui Combo's entering Peking,

95
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
Peking Opera eventually became the quintessence of Chinese culture

96
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:12,120
and entered its golden age.

97
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:14,080
And all we have to do today

98
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:17,440
is to take the torch passed down by our predecessors,

99
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,480
so that the poetic dramas on the red woolen carpet

100
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,760
will continue to be sung from generation to generation.

101

But is it a compliment

102
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:24,640
or a tragedy

103
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,120
for an art to become the quintessence

104
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:27,520

it is not really living.

An art form needs to become a part of people's daily life,

But many can understand popular art.

and refuses to be understood and appreciated,

125
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,680
but is afraid of criticism and misunderstanding,

126

132
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:26,920
spreading is more important than inheriting.

133
00:09:26,920 --> 00:09:29,280
But without innovation, how can we spread and inherit it?

134

So what kind of spreading and inheriting are you thinking of?

137
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:51,120
It was not about opera at all.

138

If you are born a fish,

139

you grow wings

140
00:09:58,080 --> 00:09:59,720
because other people like birds.

141
00:10:00,760 --> 00:10:02,040
And you even extract your bones

142
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:02,840
because other people hate fish bones.

Innovation in opera

145
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:10,920
doesn't mean denying itself,

146

nor putting it in another form

147
00:10:15,400 --> 00:10:16,520
just because you like it.

148
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:19,480
It doesn't mean abandoning the origin to pander.

00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,920
I've already been contacted.

175
00:11:57,120 --> 00:11:59,840
It's nothing. We should thank you.

176
00:12:00,920 --> 00:12:01,560
But

177
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,920
Stage play actor is a different profession.

178
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,840
Please let me know

179
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,960
if it keeps you from practicing operas.

180
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,040
Not at all.

181
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:14,560
But, sis,

182
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:16,320
I think

183
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:19,040
maybe it's time for me

184
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,400
to give up operas.

185
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Why?

186
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:25,720
Is it because

187
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:26,920
I said you didn't work hard at an early age

188
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:27,920
and didn't practice well?

189
00:12:28,680 --> 00:12:29,760
Don't take it seriously.

190
00:12:30,600 --> 00:12:31,400
That's not the reason.

191
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:32,760
You know,

192
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,000
just like this cloudy day.

193
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:37,200
It is only natural

194
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,680
that it rains.

195
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,440
But

196
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:43,360
I also need to earn my living.

197
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:49,120
But you made it through the hard times.

198
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,280
You've finished your apprenticeship now.

199
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,600
It's such a pity if you give it up.

200
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:56,840
We used to

201
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:59,200
play a bit role on TV shows,

202
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:00,480
But now we don't.

203
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:03,320
After that, we were asked to make commercial performance tours.

204
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:05,280
After they were kicked out several times by uncle,

205
00:13:05,280 --> 00:13:06,880
no one asks us to perform any more.

206
00:13:10,840 --> 00:13:12,240
Yeah. What's more,

207
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:14,400
fewer and fewer people like to watch operas now.

208
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:16,160
I'm afraid,

209
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:17,120
you know,

210
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:18,280
what can I do

211
00:13:18,280 --> 00:13:20,080
if no one

212
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:21,720
likes to watch operas?

213
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,840
I can't do anything for a living

214
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,200
except sing a few plays, sis.

215
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,680
Don't say that.

216
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:36,360
I really love opera.

217
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:37,320
Otherwise, I wouldn't have been practicing it

218
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:38,640
since I was seven.

219
00:13:38,920 --> 00:13:40,720
But does it help?

220
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:42,120
Can I earn a living just by loving it?

221
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,000
Sis, maybe my life

222
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,280
will be ruined by opera.

223
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,200
That's not going to happen.

224

Let's not talking about that. Cheers.

225

Shandengting trained you for 12 years.

230

But you associated yourself

231

Uncle,

237
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:41,120
I'm not going to act in the play.

Please don't blame her.

239
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,040
I instigated him to do this.

240
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,000

514
00:32:57,000 --> 00:33:01,000
[I've just met you, but it's like welcoming an old friend home. 
The moon is new on the horizon.]

515
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,680
Odd.

516
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:05,840
To go or not to go?

517
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:23,640
Why is it still 38.5°C?

518
00:33:53,240 --> 00:33:55,440
Coming. Coming.

519
00:33:56,760 --> 00:33:58,280
Who is it?

520
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:01,000
Who is it?

521
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,640
Coming. Coming.

522
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,560
You've got a fever

523
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,400
and you're running around with so few clothes on.

524
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:21,520
I don't have an A.I. robot

525
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,520
in my house.

526
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:25,360
If I don't run around,

527
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:26,719
who opens the door for you?

528
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,560
Legs.

529
00:34:57,040 --> 00:34:58,520
Now that rehearsal is so intense,

530
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,640
it's not appropriate for you to have a fever.

531
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:05,480
Don't worry, boss.

532
00:35:06,120 --> 00:35:08,160
As long as I can last,

533
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,080
I will attend rehearsals on time.

534
00:35:10,480 --> 00:35:13,160
I will live up to the part-time salary you paid.

535
00:36:09,760 --> 00:36:12,280
How long do you expect to be sick with pay

536
00:36:16,440 --> 00:36:18,640
if you keep drinking cold water?

537
00:36:24,600 --> 00:36:25,840
Drink it up.

538
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:53,680
Which page?

539
00:36:54,600 --> 00:36:58,600
Mr. Bai, I can still turn the pages.

540
00:37:03,560 --> 00:37:06,120
You're working so hard with a fever.

541
00:37:08,120 --> 00:37:10,440
How badly do you want to take the classes of the professor?

542
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,960
He can't see how hard you're working.

543
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:14,440
I was laughed at every day,

544
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:15,680
and I had to endure the humiliation

545
00:37:15,680 --> 00:37:17,480
and worked hard to get into college.

546
00:37:17,480 --> 00:37:18,160
Of course I have to

547
00:37:18,160 --> 00:37:19,520
attend lectures every day.

548
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:20,720
Give it to me.

549
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:23,720
I have an exam on Monday.

550
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:38,800
Where are you going?

551
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:41,040
Do you want to follow me

552
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:42,760
when I go to the bathroom?

553
00:37:45,680 --> 00:37:46,640
Make way.

554
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,800
Why did he come here all of a sudden?
