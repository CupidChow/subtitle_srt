You don't need to give the money back.

00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:19,680
Nice to meet you,
 I'm the head teacher of Hao Shi's class.

106
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:21,600
You can call me Miss Guan.

107
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,120
Great! Great! Great!

108
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:30,080
Mom, I shall go to hail a cab first,

109
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,800
and wait for you.

110
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:33,000
How did you come here, Xiao Bai?

111
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:34,120
I drove here!

112
00:06:34,480 --> 00:06:35,840
Since then,

113
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,360
Xiao Bai can drive us home!

114
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,800
Maybe what he drives is a sharing bike,

115
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:43,800
which has no place for you to sit.

116
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:45,040
What?

117
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:46,800
How can it be possible?

118
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:49,800
Fine,

119
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:52,240
you can let him drive you home,

120
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:53,880

Look at her!

122
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,480
My daughter is stubborn!

123
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:00,840
It doesn't matter, madam.

124
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:03,480
Talented people like her are always special.

125
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:05,000
Let me talk to her.

126
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
Yan Peishan,

127
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,440
let me drive you home!

128
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,760
You don't have to do so.

129
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:20,920
According to our routine,next,

130
00:07:20,920 --> 00:07:23,680
it's our audiences' show time.

131
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,240
If you'd like to perform,

132
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,400
please hold up the flower on your table.

133
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,240
This lady please!

134
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:33,880
What opera do you want to perform for us.

135
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:34,960
Not me.

136
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:37,080
It's my daughter.

137
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:43,840
She can perform 
"Dream In Peony Pavilion: An Enchanting Dream".

138
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:54,640
Here you are, newly-cut fruits.

139
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,840
-Okay, you can leave us now. -Thank you.

140
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:58,280
-Yes, I have work to do. -Thank you.

141
00:07:58,280 --> 00:07:59,080
Thank you.

142
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:01,000
Miss Guan, you can just talk to me

143
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:02,160
about Hao Shi's studies.

144
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:02,760
Okay!

145
00:08:02,760 --> 00:08:05,560
Since Miss Liu was the head teacher before...

146
00:08:05,880 --> 00:08:07,520
She's got sick.

147
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,360
So I'll take over her work during this period.

148
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,920
Did Hao Shi cause trouble

149
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:14,800
at school?

150
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:17,160
Or has he got worse grades?

151
00:08:17,880 --> 00:08:18,960
No, no, no.

152
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:20,560
He's been good recently.

153
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:22,800
And his grades have improved.

154
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:23,560
That's great!

155
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,240
Today I come

156
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:26,480
to talk with you

157
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,960
about which college he should choose.

158
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,440
We have already made the decision.

159
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,320
According to his grades,

160
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:35,000
Fudan and Tsinghua are out of reach.

161
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:37,600
But I have researched into the admission scores

162
00:08:37,600 --> 00:08:39,600
of the business major for the past few years.

163
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:40,720
If his math can be improved

164
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,039
a little bit,

165
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:42,919
I suppose

166
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:44,159
this major can be a good choice.

167
00:08:45,800 --> 00:08:47,040
For the business major,

168
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:48,960
it's really hot,

169
00:08:48,960 --> 00:08:51,040
so the competition can be intense.

170
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,000
Besides, in prestigious universities abroad,

171
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:55,360
even MBA is seen as ordinary.

172
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:59,360
Since it costs so much to study abroad,

173
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,000
and you're not that rich,

174
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,600
I really don't think it's a good choice.

175
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:06,840
So...

176
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:09,440
what major do you think

177
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,440
can be proper for Hao Shi?

178
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:13,880
Hao Shi told me

179
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,920
you're managing a garment factory, right?

180
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:18,320
Yes, that's true.

181
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,080
Actually, I think

182
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,000
costume designing

183
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,480
can be a good choice.

184
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,560
On a micro level,

185
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:26,400
today's young people

186
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:28,000
care more and more about their dressing.

187
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:29,640
On a macro level,

188
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:30,480
costume designing is an important section

189
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:32,880
of cultural creativity industry,

190
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:33,720
right?

191
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:36,000
But what Hao Shi likes is to design

192
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:37,400
gaudy clothes

193
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:38,600
for operas.

194
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,760
It's different from what you think.

195
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,320
Hao Shi,

196
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,160
where did you put the ninth book?

197
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,040
I'm watching

198
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,760
The Arrogant Pig's Fight Against the Calabash Man.

199
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:48,800
Your mom has already discovered

200
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:50,040
your comic book.

201
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:51,840
She can even find my secret hoard.

202
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,040
Where is it?

203
00:09:53,960 --> 00:09:55,360
It's under the refrigerator drawer.

204
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:56,720
Reaching into it for two-finger breaths,

205
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,320
you can get a little cardboard, and that's it.

206
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,600
So talented you are.

207
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,200
More talented than me!

208
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:03,760
Are you done?

209
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,640
I'm talking something serious with Miss Guan.

210
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:06,680
Sorry for interrupting you.

211
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:07,440
I'll go to look for the book.

212
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,280
Sorry, teacher.

213
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:13,280
I mean,

214
00:10:13,280 --> 00:10:14,360
what he likes

215
00:10:14,360 --> 00:10:16,200
doesn't seem to be promising.

216
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:19,160
I can't find it. It doesn't matter.

217
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:20,360
I'll just jump to the tenth one.

218

If you do so,

219

you'll miss the the Damage Scheme

220
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:24,360
of the Ninjatown.

221
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,440
Teacher, so you also like it.

222
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:28,640
Miss Guan asks you to look for it.

223
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:29,960
Just go to find it！

224
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,720
Sorry, I shall go to look for it.

225
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:34,560
So, I shall continue.

226
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:35,080
Yes, of course.

227
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,120
Actually, costume designing

228
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,680
is an emerging industry,

229
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:39,120
which can be very promising.

230
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:42,120
Moreover, I think it's very good

231
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,400
for everyone to do

the boner likes?

237
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,520
I can tell you that

238
00:10:52,840 --> 00:10:54,600
after you see the War at the Final Valley,

239
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,480
you'll find out

240

If I don't wear the make-up,

244

then it can't be seen as a formal performance.

can I drive you home.

Fine, after we go onto the stage,

I'll make three quarter-note beats per measure.

00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:26,880
Maybe you'll change your mind

344
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:28,280
when you arrives at your home.

345
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:38,880
So you live here?

346
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:42,600
You've never been to this kind of place?

347
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:43,760
Curious about it?

348
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:47,080
It's a bustling place.

349
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,240
And I can smell the Osmanthus fragrance.

350
00:17:50,840 --> 00:17:52,240
Can't you smell it

351
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:53,320
around the Five-Star Hotels?

352
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,200
Do you think this kind of flower is too cheap?

353
00:17:55,560 --> 00:17:57,600
Why are you always being hostile to me?

354
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,160
I just want you

355
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,760
to perform my stage play.

356
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,160
I'm home!

357
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:05,080
Wait!

358
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,560
This is my business card

359
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,600
with my contact number on it.

360
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:15,300
[Founder of Jiubai]

361
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:17,480
The salary's gonna be considerable.

362
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:19,880
I'll wait you till six tomorrow afternoon.

363
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,400
I really want to know

364
00:18:23,920 --> 00:18:25,360
why do you pick me among so many people

365
00:18:25,640 --> 00:18:27,080
who can act in operas.

366
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:29,000
I have been to many opera troupes and theaters

367
00:18:29,240 --> 00:18:31,320
before I come to you.

368
00:18:32,760 --> 00:18:34,560
Many of them are excellent,

369
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,480
but they're not the Liu Xichan I want.

370
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:39,720
Till the other night

371
00:18:39,960 --> 00:18:41,320
when I saw you perform 
"The Dragon Meets the Phoenix"

372
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,000
in the Shandengting troupe.

373
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:47,760
I didn't do very well for that,

374
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:48,720
because I forgot the words when performing.

375
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,320
Really?

376
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,800
Maybe you didn't really forget the words.

377
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,880
At that night,

378
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,280
I became so sure that

379
00:18:58,720 --> 00:18:59,360
you are the one I want

380
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,440
for the role of Liu Xichan.

381
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,200
Why?

382
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:07,400
Both Liu Xichan and you know
 what you love and pursue.

383
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,520
What she pursues

384
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,360
is love.

385
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,120
Her distinctive personality and character

386
00:19:15,120 --> 00:19:16,920
can be seen

387
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:18,480
through the play.

388
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:22,080
So the one to perform this role

389
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:23,720
should be able to perform operas,

390
00:19:24,200 --> 00:19:26,800
and be firm in what she loves.

391
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:28,960
Just like you.

392
00:19:30,560 --> 00:19:31,800
But I'm not like that,

393
00:19:31,800 --> 00:19:32,880
because I gave up.

394
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:34,120
What do you mean?

395
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:37,600
Nothing.

396
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:40,880
So the "South Song" is about

397
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:43,520
Liu Xichan's pursuing love.

398
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:44,960
Yes,

399
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,560
and no!

400
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:52,360
Liu Xichan is a girl

401
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:54,120
in the dream of a scholar
 who was to take the imperial exam in capital.

402
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:56,280
He met Liu Xichan

403
00:19:56,280 --> 00:19:58,320
for three times in his dream.

404
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:01,520
Although they met in different dynasties
 with different identities,

405
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,400
the scholar fell in love with Liu Xichan

406
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:06,560
in all his three dreams.

407
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:09,840
And then?

408
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,680
You'll know it when you perform the role.

409
00:20:58,160 --> 00:20:59,160
I should go home now.

410
00:20:59,640 --> 00:21:00,400
See you.

411
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:37,160
Have you got

412
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:37,960
the multimedia program modified?

413
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,000
Yes.

414
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,360
What about the music in the last?

415
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:42,800
It's the last time to modify "Sir Wuchang".

416
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:45,560
Let's see the effect tomorrow morning.

417
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,360
What about the costume for Liu Xichan?

418
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:49,520
It's in that box.

419
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,720
I have already checked it.

420
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:52,840
So,

421
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,480
I have got the costume,

422
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:55,920
but have you got the actor?

423
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,560
Almost!

424
00:21:58,520 --> 00:21:59,400
Fine！

425
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:07,280
So the Osmanthus fragrance I just smelt

426
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,040
came from you.

427
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,160
How did you persuade her?

428
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,320
Or maybe you have been persuaded?

429
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,400
Do you know what the Osmanthus fragrance implies?

430
00:22:20,120 --> 00:22:21,480
It's related to Glutinous Rice Balls in Fermented Rice Wine.

431
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:24,920
It implies being together with your beloved one.

432
00:22:52,600 --> 00:22:55,160
Jiuye, how long do we have to wait?

433
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,120
Why don't you persuade the boss

434
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:58,400
to let Lingjiu come back?

435
00:22:59,520 --> 00:23:01,840
All right. I'll talk with him.

436
00:23:06,280 --> 00:23:08,000
It's already 10.

437
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:10,080
Give Lingjiu a call, okay?

438
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:11,960
Beg her to come back and play Liu Xichan.

439
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:14,520
Let's wait.

440
00:23:14,520 --> 00:23:15,800
What are you waiting for?

441
00:23:16,160 --> 00:23:17,240
Do we have to give up South Song

442
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,680
without Yan Peishan?

443
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:30,960
Hello?

444
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:32,400
Yan Peishan.

445
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:33,960
Yan Peishan.

446
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:38,080
How much can you pay for the performance

447
00:23:38,360 --> 00:23:39,440
you mentioned yesterday?

448
00:23:39,650 --> 00:23:42,260
# [收费票据]

449
00:23:41,160 --> 00:23:42,160
I want fifty thousand.

450
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:44,200
Pay me on the same day.

451
00:23:46,040 --> 00:23:46,920
Okay.

452
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:48,720
I'm coming to you right now.

453
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:12,800
Aunt.

454
00:24:16,160 --> 00:24:18,400
Feifei, how is your mom?

455
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:22,880
The doctor says it's stable.

456
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,280
But I have some urgent things to do.

457
00:24:28,920 --> 00:24:31,640
Aunt, please

458
00:24:32,040 --> 00:24:33,240
take care of my mom.

459
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:34,960
We are family.

460
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,480
Why are you always being polite?

461
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:38,520
Go about your business.

462
00:24:40,560 --> 00:24:42,640
Don't get too tired after donating blood.

463
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,400
Don't worry. I'm here.

464
00:24:49,600 --> 00:24:50,400
Go.

465
00:24:51,320 --> 00:24:52,240
Go.

466
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:53,240
I'm leaving.

467
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:09,200
Mom.

468
00:25:10,080 --> 00:25:12,600
I have heated the food. Eat now.

469
00:25:13,040 --> 00:25:15,040
Go back, now.

470
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,880
Go home and do your homework.

471
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,240
Don't stay in the hospital.

472
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:19,720
Here is my homework.

473
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,280
I'll study here today.

474
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,240
Is my sister inside?

475
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:30,440
She's off to work.

476
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,080
When mom was a child,

477
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:39,320
we were really poor.

478
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:42,120
Everything

479
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:43,840
relied on your Aunt Shan alone.

480
00:25:45,920 --> 00:25:47,680
At that time,

481
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:49,840
it was just like this.

482
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:51,840
She was working,

483
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:54,960
and I was doing my homework by her side.

484
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:57,200
She asked me to study hard,

485
00:25:58,400 --> 00:26:00,000
make something,

486
00:26:00,600 --> 00:26:02,000
and don't be like her.

487
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,080
Aunt brought up sister by herself,

488
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,920
and you set up a factory by yourself.

489
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,120
I think both of you made something.

490
00:26:12,200 --> 00:26:13,320
My boy.

491
00:26:15,960 --> 00:26:17,360
Tell mom.

492
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,480
you say you're going to costume school,

493
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,040
are you serious?

494
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:23,520
Yes.

495
00:26:24,920 --> 00:26:27,320
I don't mean you have to listen to me.

496
00:26:27,320 --> 00:26:29,400
At your age,

497
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:31,000
it's normal

498
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,040
to like comic

499
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,720
and design clothes

500
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:34,720
for comic book characters.

501
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,920
But what about three or five years from now?

502
00:26:36,920 --> 00:26:37,560
Will you feel that

503
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:40,120
your favorite things are too childish?

504
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,800
But comics are not all childish.

505
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:46,840
Indeed, many comics now tell stories

506
00:26:46,840 --> 00:26:48,840
of beauty and ugliness, good and evil,

507
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,880
ardency and youth.

508
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,360
But I think,

509
00:26:52,360 --> 00:26:54,520
good will triumph over evil,

510
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:56,440
is this childish?

511
00:26:56,440 --> 00:26:58,920
I know I'm too young,

512
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:01,400
and you are worried about my decisions.

513
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:04,640
But does a man have to do evil

514
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:05,800
when he grows up?

515
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,280
If a person has faith

516
00:27:08,280 --> 00:27:09,560
and dream,

517
00:27:09,560 --> 00:27:11,720
does that make him childish?

518
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:13,440
I don't think so.

519
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:16,720
Well, well.

520
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:19,160
I won't stop you.

521
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:21,560
Go head and be childish if you want.

522
00:27:22,560 --> 00:27:24,120
Really?

523
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:27,400
If you really like it, then make something.

524
00:27:28,440 --> 00:27:29,520
Thank you, mom!

525
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:42,280
In fact, I can just rehearse.

526
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,160
Eat first.

527
00:27:53,080 --> 00:27:53,960
By the way,

528
00:27:55,720 --> 00:27:58,360
take the fish soup home for your mother.

529
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:06,040
Thanks.

530
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:21,800
Give me a hand.

531
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:44,560
All right.

532
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:49,760
Collar, shoulder line, sleeve length, waistline,

533
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:51,080
and dress length

534
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:52,120
are all perfect.

535
00:28:54,360 --> 00:28:56,000
Do you feel uncomfortable?

536
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,960
It's all right. Thank you.

537
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:04,520
Then I'll take it off before the rehearsal.

538
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:05,840
so it won't be dirty.

539
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:07,040
Okay.

540
00:29:07,480 --> 00:29:08,880
Let's change into our leotards.

541
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:10,040
I'll come with you.

542
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,400
Come on.

543
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,440
It's your part.

544
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:39,640
There may be some acrobatic fighting.

545
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:41,920
I want it

546
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:43,880
to be more of a Peking Opera.

547
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:45,840
Well, Peking Opera.

548
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:48,280
Then we could add some martial arts movements

549
00:29:48,280 --> 00:29:49,880
of Acrobatic Male in Peking Opera.

550
00:29:58,560 --> 00:30:00,480
But I actually think

551
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:02,680
it would be nice to have some props

552
00:30:02,680 --> 00:30:03,920
to use.

553
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:05,760
Our movements would be

554
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:08,240
much more agile if we had props.

555
00:30:09,680 --> 00:30:12,360
I'm thinking about Liu Xichan's assassination.

556
00:30:12,680 --> 00:30:13,960
How about holding a fan?

557
00:30:16,120 --> 00:30:17,400
Go.

558
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,440
This way.

559
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,680
Since she wanted to help JinYiwei guard escape,

560
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,360
why did she stab him?

561
00:30:27,320 --> 00:30:28,960
Only when she stabbed

562
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:30,440
did she know if she could bring herself to do it.

563
00:30:31,640 --> 00:30:33,280
Well, if that's the case,

564
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,640
it's better to take him by surprise.

565
00:30:38,960 --> 00:30:41,680
There is a movement in Beijing Opera called Cibeng.

566
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,000
It's like this.

567
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:47,440
Sorry.

568
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:49,120
It's all right.

569
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,880
But it looks like it's bleeding.

570
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:00,040
I'm sorry.

571
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:02,240
I just didn't get the distance right.

572
00:31:03,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Excuse me,

573
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,960
Can you help me to bandage it up?

574
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,600
All right, is there a medical kit?

575
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:10,400
Backstage.

576
00:31:18,720 --> 00:31:19,440
All right.

577
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:21,320
Thanks.

578
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:23,640
I made it.

579
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:25,600
Why are you thanking me?

580
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,400
I'm glad I got cut

581
00:31:29,920 --> 00:31:31,400
by Liu Xichan.

582
00:31:32,520 --> 00:31:33,520
Because I thought

583
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:34,960
we couldn't find

584
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:36,480
Liu Xichan before the play.

585
00:31:40,160 --> 00:31:41,600
Do you make a lot of money

586
00:31:41,600 --> 00:31:42,800
on this play?

587
00:31:45,480 --> 00:31:46,680
Actually not.

588
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:49,680
We lose money almost every time.

589
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,360
Take the copyright of South Song for example.

590
00:31:54,120 --> 00:31:57,080
When we bought it, everyone didn't like it.

591
00:31:57,720 --> 00:31:59,240
They thought it was too artistic.

592
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,800
I don't know much about art,

593
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:05,560
but I like the story of South Song,

594
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:08,840
although it's a sad story.

595
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:10,680
A sad story?

596
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:14,440
Liu Xichan is scholar's dreamlover.

597
00:32:15,200 --> 00:32:17,160
But they had no good results

598
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,960
in the first two lives.

599
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:22,280
When he meets her in the dream for the third time,

600
00:32:22,280 --> 00:32:25,240
will he stay and try again?

601
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:28,000
It's true.

602
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:31,120
The author stops the story on this choice,

603
00:32:31,600 --> 00:32:32,800
telling us that

604
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,600
some are choices,

605
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:36,320
and some

606
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:37,960
are fate.

607
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:42,720
What if it is fate?

608
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:46,280
If it is a dream, there will be a moment to wake up.

609
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:49,320
But in the dream,

610
00:32:50,160 --> 00:32:52,040
even if it is only for a moment,

611
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:56,440
even if ending has already been there,

612
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:59,440
with one look,

613
00:33:00,040 --> 00:33:01,960
perhaps with just one look,

614
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:05,640
Liu Xichan and the scholar will understand

615
00:33:06,440 --> 00:33:08,640
that they have accompanied each other

616
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:10,840
for thousands of years.

617
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:13,320
No matter how it ends,

618
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:16,040
from that look,

619
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,320
they have been the lover of each other.

620
00:33:20,080 --> 00:33:22,400
It takes just one look in your eyes to know I have loved you for ten thousand years. I like this ending.

621
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,040
I believe that

622
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,600
family affection is the same.

623
00:33:29,080 --> 00:33:30,840
No matter where the person is,

624
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,640
he is in our hearts.

625
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,680
I'll take you to a place.

626
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:50,920
Why?

627
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,920
Nothing. Just go.

628
00:33:57,040 --> 00:33:57,920
Come here.

629
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:05,160
Press the yellow button on the far left,

630
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:11,159
and then push the third button from the right

631
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:12,239
to 60%,

632
00:34:12,800 --> 00:34:14,600
the fifth button to 80%,

633
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:17,520
and the twelfth to full.

634
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,440
Let's switch places.

635
00:34:29,920 --> 00:34:31,040
This is the flowing light.

636
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,120
It emphasizes the character's design

637
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:34,960
when the character comes on stage.

638
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:38,520
This is the follow spot.

639
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,400
It is used to emphasize the movement and stick to the rhythm.

640
00:34:43,040 --> 00:34:44,639
Peking Opera has one table and two chairs.

641
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:47,880
Movies can push close-ups for montage.

642
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,280
Stage plays also have their own forms of expression.

643
00:34:51,520 --> 00:34:53,040
Sound, light and electricity are used

644
00:34:53,040 --> 00:34:55,159
to outline the characters' movements

645
00:34:55,159 --> 00:34:58,240
and explain the logic of the story clearly.

646
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,080
After all, the stage is not just for the actors' interest.

647
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,920
The audience should have empathy

648
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,960
and have the same feelings.

649
00:35:13,920 --> 00:35:15,680
If you still want to come with me

650
00:35:16,320 --> 00:35:17,760
after the show,

651
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:19,600
we can go to see the ending

652
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,400
of that ten thousand years together.

653

This patient was just brought in today.

656
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:49,560
Stage three cervical cancer.

657

It has spread by 80%.

She was brought in on time,

659
00:35:53,240 --> 00:35:54,800
so she's in relatively stable condition.

660
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,360
How much time does she have?

661
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:58,200
We will try our best.

It's golden, with three osmanthus flowers.

I

676
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:58,440
I distinctly remember

677
00:37:58,440 --> 00:38:00,200

Yes.

00:38:19,480 --> 00:38:21,440
Wait a minute. I need you to look at

686
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:23,440
Liu Xichan's clothes.

687
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,160
Wuchang, I told you to put your stuff away.

688
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:26,480
How did this happen?

689
00:38:27,160 --> 00:38:28,520
Who do you think

690
00:38:28,520 --> 00:38:29,680
did this?

691
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,520
It doesn't matter who did it,

692
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:32,920
All that matters is that

693
00:38:33,640 --> 00:38:35,120
we will win.

694
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:37,160
You go first.

695
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,080
I'll check the cameras in central control.

696
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:42,300
# [门诊]

697
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,280
What's the matter?

698
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
Thirsty.

699
00:39:01,880 --> 00:39:03,240
I can't believe

700
00:39:03,440 --> 00:39:07,160
God doesn't accept me

701
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,680
because he wants me to suffer more.

702
00:39:18,280 --> 00:39:19,400
Mom.

703
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:21,720
Is this fish soup delicious?

704
00:39:24,120 --> 00:39:25,560
Bai Feili bought it.

705
00:39:26,760 --> 00:39:28,440
Xiao Bai is good.

706
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:31,240
He's better than Xiao Dao.

707
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,680
What are you comparing them?

708
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:37,200
You don't know how to choose until you compare.

709
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,960
There is good and bad of bird's nest, let alone people.

710
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:43,880
Did you

711
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:45,960
make a long comparison

712
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,720
when you sent me to the Shandengting troupe?

713
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:52,120
I'm not around you,

714
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:54,640
and you feel nothing, right?

715
00:39:56,000 --> 00:39:58,120
I don't know how happy I am

716
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:01,880
without you.

717
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:07,640
That's what I think.

718
00:40:09,360 --> 00:40:11,000
When I was young,

719
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:12,840
I always wanted to come back,

720
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:15,920
but I was afraid to make you angry.

721
00:40:17,360 --> 00:40:19,160
When I slept in the dormitory at night,

722
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:21,920
I felt it was so dark

723
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:25,960
that I had to touch the bracelet you bought me

724
00:40:25,960 --> 00:40:27,320
to fall asleep.

725
00:40:31,320 --> 00:40:32,440
Sister.

726
00:40:33,000 --> 00:40:34,680
Here's the medicine.

727
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:37,960
Take medicine after dinner.

728
00:40:42,900 --> 00:40:43,300
# [白翡丽]

729
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,120
Feifei,

730
00:40:45,600 --> 00:40:47,360
if you have something to do, you should go.

731
00:40:47,360 --> 00:40:48,720
I'm here.

732
00:40:51,480 --> 00:40:52,760
I'm here.

733
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:56,200
Thank you, aunt.

734
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:58,360
We're family. I should do that.

735
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,320
Just go.

736
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:08,760
Then I'll go.

737
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:16,600
Yu Fei.

738
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,560
Come back.

739
00:41:25,360 --> 00:41:27,280
Remember to get the bird's nest back.

740
00:41:31,520 --> 00:41:33,120
You will be well soon.

741
00:41:33,320 --> 00:41:34,960
There's plenty of bird's nest.
