[Episode 11]

4
00:01:58,759 --> 00:02:00,440
It's all my fault.

5
00:02:00,440 --> 00:02:01,320
I remember now.

6
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:02,640
I accidentally poured the milk tea with wine

7
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,680
into the gourd that day.

8
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:05,320
No…

9
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,199
Actually I'm the one to blame.

10
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,800
I couldn't hold my liquor well,

11
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,320
and easily got drunk.

12
00:02:18,079 --> 00:02:18,800
Come on.

00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:19,680
Gui Deng…

14
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:29,720
Gui Deng, you haven't caught toys

15
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:32,079
from claw machines for me yet.

16
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:37,440
Gui Deng…

17
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:39,200
Give it to me.

18
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,400
You could just treat us to a meal.

19
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,360
I think

20
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,560
no one's blaming you.

21
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,760
-Yes. -Right.

22
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:46,840
Yeah.

Le

24
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:05,080
has a dream,

25
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:08,440
which is

26
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:09,760
going to America

27
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:11,720
to take part in the robot competition one day.

28
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
This is his work.

29
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:19,880
Just take it

30
00:03:21,880 --> 00:03:23,320
as a souvenir.

31
00:03:25,320 --> 00:03:26,240
Gui,

32
00:03:26,960 --> 00:03:28,760
we are a team.

33
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,680
We should keep going together.

34
00:03:35,800 --> 00:03:37,400
I like the clothes you designed.

35
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:41,880
Hope you can make some clothes for these robots.

36
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,800
Have you prepared well?

37
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,480
It's not a big deal.

38
00:04:22,480 --> 00:04:24,080
Anyway, there are few candidates for the traditional opera.

39
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,840
I'll get admitted just by some leg kicks.

40
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:28,840
Besides, we're just trying to achieve the goal by another way,

41
00:04:28,840 --> 00:04:29,240
right?

42
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:31,800
Certainly. I've heard

43
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:33,240
that many scouts now

44
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,920
are beginning to pay attention to opera students.

45
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:37,320
Do you think there are this kind of scouts

46
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:38,880
outside our examination place?

47
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:41,360
And then we can be elected!

48
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:47,520
Are they crazy?

49
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:48,480
Come on.

50
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:53,280
Beijing Opera major,

51
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,760
No. 32 to No. 37.

52
00:05:01,480 --> 00:05:04,160
Hello, sirs. I'm the candidate, Chen Yuanhao.

53
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:06,520
I apply for Beijing Opera major because

54
00:05:06,520 --> 00:05:09,720
I've been fond of this national art,

55
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,440
which integrates literature with performance and music.

56
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:12,240
I hope…

57
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,800
Then you, please tell us

58
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,840
why do you apply for Beijing Opera major?

59
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,080
Because I'm only good at singing Beijing Opera.

60
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:27,680
Only good at singing Beijing Opera? Why?

61
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,159
I joined the opera troupe at the age of 12.

62
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:36,960
Only if I sang the opera well

63
00:05:37,159 --> 00:05:39,600
could I be able to eat and sleep.

64
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:42,920
In the past ten years, I've learned nothing

65
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,280
but singing the opera.

66
00:05:47,800 --> 00:05:48,760
How many lancer poses can you do?

67
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,360
All.

68
00:05:51,159 --> 00:05:51,760
Show us.

69
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:30,040
I'm sorry.

70
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,600
Seeing Le grow up day by day,

71
00:06:35,480 --> 00:06:36,720
I realize

72
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:39,200
how important his dream is.

73
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,000
I don't want him

74
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
to live a hard life in the real world

75
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:48,080
because of his father, who indulges in his dream.

76
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:53,040
Right…

77
00:06:56,159 --> 00:06:57,600
After all, there aren't

78
00:06:58,600 --> 00:07:00,080
any dimension door in the real world.

79
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:04,880
We've known each other for a long time.

80
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,080
I still want to say this to you in person.

81
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:13,920
Bye-bye.

Le,

Dad!

85
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,840
Why did you pick up so many malfunctioned parts again?

86
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:18,480
Our school's robotics team

87
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:21,200
just eliminated a batch of parts,

88
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,280
many of which were still quite new.

89
00:08:24,880 --> 00:08:25,840
Le,

90
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:28,720
let's stop picking up this kind of parts, all right?

91
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,000
I'll take you to the shop next time.

92
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,000
Let's buy new parts.

93
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,120
Really?

94
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:32,919
Yeah.

95
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,600

00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,159
isn't it a waste of money?

00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:41,760
better job.

00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,280
you're really fragile.

We thought we should at least

114
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,600
let you show up at the premiere.

115
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:37,680
But we didn't expect

116
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:40,440
that two minutes of appearance would cause you a fracture for two months.

117
00:09:41,640 --> 00:09:43,280
Please stop nagging him.

118

he still hanged in there until the curtain call.

Where's your family?

139
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,600
I just overheard

140
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,040
that doctor would cut off my right hand.

141
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:17,080
You can still hold cola with your left hand.

142
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,680
It's not because of cola.

143
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:23,960
Though cola is also important,

144
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:27,160
with my arm cut off,

145
00:11:28,200 --> 00:11:29,880
I just can't play

Who says you can't play the lead role

148
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,520
with your arm cut off?

149

Look.

00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:44,960
The main character of this comic book

151
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,200
also lost his right hand.

152
00:11:50,600 --> 00:11:51,920
He's called Edward,

153
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,920
who's even poorer than you, for he also lost his foot.

154
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,960
But just because of this,

155
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,320
he owned the robotic armor,

156
00:11:59,320 --> 00:12:01,000
as the main character of this comic book.

157
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:03,280
This is no more than a comic.

158
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,200
He couldn't lend his robotic armor to me.

159
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:07,840
It's feasible.

160
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,680
I can make you

161
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,600
a cooler robotic arm than this.

162
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:19,120
So cool!

163
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,600
Let me write a script for you, which is more fascinating

164
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:23,040
than the one in school repertoire, okay?

165
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:25,440

and give you my son to play.

00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:44,760
are doctors and nurses from another dimension.

174
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,480
Is it cool?

175
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:48,400
Another dimension? Where is it?

176
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,920
A place where you can reach

177
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:53,640
without navigation, transportation, to any ticket.

178
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:56,840
That's an inclusive world,

179
00:12:56,840 --> 00:12:58,000
where

180
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,000
even the common people

181
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,080
can be sparkling,

182
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,120
and the normal men

183
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:03,960
can also be superheroes.

184
00:13:04,600 --> 00:13:06,760
Anyway, in that world,

185
00:13:07,080 --> 00:13:08,840
nothing is impossible.

186
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:11,240
Then can I join you

187
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:12,840
to go to that world?

188
00:13:12,840 --> 00:13:14,160
Of course you can!

189
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:16,880
We can also hold a show in the hospital for you

190
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:19,040
where you're the leading actor, okay?

191
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,520
That will be much more interesting

192
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,280
than your school repertoire.

193
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:21,800
Right.

194
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,280
You're so nice! Then it's a deal!

195
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:25,080
Okay…

196
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,480
We just happened to bring the camera.

197
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:27,720
Shall we take some photos together?

198
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:28,440
Right…

199
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:29,600
-Let's go! -Go!

200
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:30,600
Let's go…

201
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,080
Then let's go back to shoot.

202
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:32,520
Come on.

203
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,440
Take photos together.

204
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,040
Right.

205
00:13:35,800 --> 00:13:37,240
-Look at that! -There!

206
00:13:39,520 --> 00:13:41,080
Come on! Look at this…

207
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:42,040
Quickly!

208
00:13:42,040 --> 00:13:45,680
Three, two, one, Jiubai!

209
00:14:06,400 --> 00:14:07,400
Mengru,

210
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,720
why are you looking at us?

211
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,400
You two are wearing sister-and-brother clothes today!

212
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:19,320
Go! Get your sauce!

213
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:24,280
I don't want to play the younger brother.

214
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:26,640
Then what else do you want to play?

215
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:30,840
It was you

216
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:32,880
who escorted me home yesterday, right?

217
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:34,960
It was the driver.

218
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:37,760
I just sent you to the car.

219
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,840
All right. The driver sent me home,

220
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,080
and prepared hot soup for me.

221
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:46,520
He even changed all the stuff in my fridge.

222
00:14:47,520 --> 00:14:48,880
Remember to give him five-star feedback.

223
00:14:52,080 --> 00:14:54,320
Right, before I lost my memory yesterday,

224
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,600
you said you want this.

225
00:14:57,200 --> 00:14:57,960
Now I give it to you.

226
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:00,880
This is the most precious thing I have.

227
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:04,440
Miss Guanjiu, is this the stuff

228
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,960
that you can easily send to others?

229
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,120
If you don't want it, I can give it to someone else.

230
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:11,120
No way!

231
00:15:13,080 --> 00:15:14,600
Today's boys

232
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:17,480
are not interested in basketball stars anymore?

233
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:20,000
This is No. 2325!

234
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,040
Really expensive.

235
00:15:21,720 --> 00:15:23,800
If you don't want it, I'll send it to others.

236
00:15:23,800 --> 00:15:26,800
I like it… It's mine now.

237
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,240
What? What do you like?

238
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:30,920
Hotpot.

239
00:15:31,520 --> 00:15:32,480
You like hotpot?

240
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,200
Then let's eat!

241
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:36,760
Take after it's cooked.

242
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:38,320
Uncooked. Let me give it to you.

243
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,680
Just kidding, it's cooked.

244
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,920
Hey! Don't just focus on the hotpot.

245
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,360
Help me figure out how to explain it to Boss

246
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,320
so as to let him believe the thing about this letter.

247
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,280
M-my idea is this.

248
00:15:51,280 --> 00:15:52,800
See if it's feasible.

249
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:55,480
Guideng sent Le to Los Angeles,

250
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:56,600
and they had already boarded the plane.

251
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:58,320
No one accepted your letter.

252
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:58,680
How's that?

253
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:02,000
This just sounds like a lie.

254
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:03,440
I think it's not good.

255
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,960
I agree.

256
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:07,120
Then how about being straightforward?

257
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,960
Guideng went to Los Angeles with Le,

258
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:12,040
and no one wanted your money.

259
00:16:14,280 --> 00:16:15,640
Sounds good.

260
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,120
Boss.

261
00:16:19,640 --> 00:16:21,240
You don't want this money, huh?

262
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,640
Then don't complain about poverty or tiredness in the following days.

263
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:27,520
-Okay. -Yes.

264
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:29,200
Guanshan, why are you so late?

265
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:29,920
Sit down please.

266
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:31,480
Come on, let's start eating.

267
00:16:32,080 --> 00:16:32,960
Take more.

268
00:16:33,600 --> 00:16:34,240
Right,

269
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,680
Guideng and his son

270
00:16:36,680 --> 00:16:38,480
is really on their way to Los Angeles.

271
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,600
So, you can rest assured.

272
00:16:42,320 --> 00:16:43,720
Brilliant, Boss.

273
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,400
So efficient.

274
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,440
I propose a toast to Boss!

275
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:47,880
-Right. -To Boss.

276
00:16:49,280 --> 00:16:50,360
Thank you for your work.

277
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,880
Guanshan, good job.

278
00:16:53,160 --> 00:16:55,040
You settled everything secretly.

279
00:16:56,800 --> 00:16:58,520
And I'm going to declare another thing.

280
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:01,960
Next we're going to restart Dream of the South Song Ⅱ.

281
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,200
It's more than a restart.

282
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,319
We'll also make it the finale at midnight

283
00:17:05,319 --> 00:17:06,240
of the network New Year's Gala.

284
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:11,359
Brilliant, Boss!

285
00:17:11,359 --> 00:17:12,599
Come on, let's propose another toast!

286
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,119
Love you ten thousand years, Jiubai.

287
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:16,839
-Cheers! -Thank you, Boss.

288
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:17,960
Viva Jiubai!

289
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:21,359
Wuchang, you're kind of exaggerated sometimes.

290
00:17:22,440 --> 00:17:23,440
Mind it…

291
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:26,200
Now that we're going to start a new project,

292
00:17:27,359 --> 00:17:29,800
we don't need the lantern wall in Dragon Scale

293
00:17:29,800 --> 00:17:30,360
anymore.

294
00:17:30,360 --> 00:17:32,120
But we shouldn't make it without anything in return.

295
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:33,920
Maybe I can sell it on the second-hand platform

296
00:17:33,920 --> 00:17:35,880
to earn some money for our new props.

297
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:39,320
Well…

298
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:42,720
I heard that if you make a wish to the lantern wall,

299
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:43,920
that wish will come true.

300
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:45,160
Seriously?

301
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,200
Yeah!

302
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:47,880
-I've also heard that. -Yes.

303
00:17:47,880 --> 00:17:48,760
-Right? -Yes.

304
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:49,880
Then what are you waiting for?

305
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:51,720
Let's go to do it now!

306
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,080
-Go! -Let's go.

307
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,440
-Go, let's go together. -Let's go.

308
00:17:57,360 --> 00:17:59,120
Right! Turn it on!

309
00:17:59,120 --> 00:17:59,800
Quickly!

310
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,440
Go there…

311
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,160
So beautiful.

312
00:18:05,160 --> 00:18:06,040
Here we go.

313
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,240
You really did a good job!

314
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,760
I want to learn how to make props from you!

315
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:13,920
You'd better focus on writing scripts.

316
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,480
So talented you are in writing. Everyone needs you!

317
00:18:17,040 --> 00:18:19,000
Guanshan, come to make a wish.

318
00:18:19,720 --> 00:18:21,560
Don't bother, I'm not going to occupy the place

319
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:23,200
to make a wish to the prop board.

320
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:24,600
You go make your wishes.

321
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,640
Miss Guanjiu, what are you wishing for?

322
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:34,960
Why should I tell you?

323
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:36,960
I just want to hear more or less.

324
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:39,360
No.

325
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:50,280
I don't believe in making wishes.

326
00:18:51,560 --> 00:18:53,520
If I have to say something about my wish,

327
00:18:55,560 --> 00:18:57,400
I love adventurous flying.

328
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:00,200
And I also know

329
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:02,040
no one

330
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,240
could always keep flying.

331
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,760
My wish is

332
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,200
that if I fall one day,

333
00:19:10,760 --> 00:19:11,920
I can

334
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:14,560
fall on your planet.

335
00:19:16,920 --> 00:19:20,330
♫ Canoe adrift on the sea ♫

336
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,290
♫ Or wind across the forest ♫

337
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:29,620
♫ Fury against kindness ♫

338
00:19:30,380 --> 00:19:34,620
♫ Crowds are silent but also turbulent ♫

339
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,970
♫ Time flies and life is transient ♫

340
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:44,020
♫ We don't have much time to hesitate ♫

341
00:19:44,390 --> 00:19:48,530
♫ I won't let you go ♫

342
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:52,830
♫ Like a beast breaking out of the cage ♫

343
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:57,410
♫ Rushing through the winding river and against the roaring wind ♫

344
00:19:57,960 --> 00:20:02,270
♫ Even if I shout in despair ♫

345
00:20:02,790 --> 00:20:04,350
♫ The hidden pain of the past ♫

346

♫ The whisper of passing time ♫

351
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:32,880
This comic book says

352
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,400
there's a way to divine with cat paws.

353
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:37,560
Do you think it's real?

354
00:20:37,560 --> 00:20:40,000
I heard people say that it's quite accurate.

355
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:41,960
Then I'll give it a try, too.

356
00:20:42,520 --> 00:20:44,040
Just divine whether you could

357
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:45,600
get investment successfully this time.

358
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:50,520
Our Cang also has paws,

359
00:20:50,520 --> 00:20:51,640
right?

360
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:58,760
Cang, tell me…

361
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:00,680
Are you all right?

362
00:21:00,680 --> 00:21:03,240
It's okay. It nearly bit me once again.

363
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,520
You the short-sighted rat!

364
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:08,040
I've fed you for so long!

365
00:21:08,040 --> 00:21:10,080
You still haven't built deep friendship with me?

366
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm going to open the door.

367
00:21:21,640 --> 00:21:22,440
Guanjiu…

368
00:21:25,400 --> 00:21:26,800
I'm going to fetch you flippers.

369
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,440
It's okay, I'll take them myself.

370
00:21:37,160 --> 00:21:38,160
You came here before?

371
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:39,920
I used to…

372
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,000
I've been here a few times, for work affairs.

373
00:21:49,920 --> 00:21:51,840
Shall we enter first?

374
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:00,800
Hello.

375
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:03,920
Find a place to sit, and let's start directly.

376
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,200
I was held up on the way for a while.

377
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:08,400
You've caught a cold?

378
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:09,520
It doesn't matter.

379
00:22:12,280 --> 00:22:14,560
I've checked these VC firms.

380
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,960
They have different preferences.

381
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,760
And I also adjusted the business plans respectively.

382
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,520
The biggest problem now

383
00:22:20,520 --> 00:22:21,960
lies in the marketing.

384
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:24,560
There isn't much capital we can invest in it.

385
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:26,800
So why did you tell them we were going to make

386
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:28,520
Dream of the South Ⅱ before capital is ready?

387
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:32,080
Public praise matters more than any KOL.

388
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,000
It's enough for us to promote

389
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:34,880
through Jiubai's public account.

390
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:36,280
Here you are. Water.

391
00:22:36,640 --> 00:22:37,320
Thank you.

392
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,480
Take your time then.

393
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,240
Speaking of promotion by official account,

394
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,640
Jiubai's data is not that good.

395
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:50,680
Our page views are okay.

396
00:22:50,680 --> 00:22:53,200
But today's investment companies are all astute.

397
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,440
They'll check both page views

398
00:22:54,440 --> 00:22:55,920
and unique visitors.

399
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:58,280
How about this?

400
00:22:58,800 --> 00:23:00,080
Let's leave alone those PV

401
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,200
and UV.

402
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,040
Let's just talk based on the promotion

403
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,560
by Jiubai Studio's official account.

404
00:23:06,040 --> 00:23:07,920
Just see how to address this issue.

405
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:09,640
In view of the investment,

406
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,560
our Jiubai's statistics are not that good.

407
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:13,440
Just think about it.

408
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,590
[Dream of the South]

409
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,360
I think there are actually other solutions

410
00:23:16,360 --> 00:23:17,960
to promotion.

411
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:20,400
Come on,

412
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:22,720
have a look at this page.

413
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:23,840
Those on this page.

414
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,720
And then…

415
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,560
Let me search for it.

416
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:35,520
There are some name lists. Have a look at them.

417
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:36,240
Okay.

418
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:44,720
This name list…

419
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:47,080
One, two, three.

420
00:23:50,920 --> 00:23:52,840
What's this White Flame Pterosaur?

421
00:23:56,040 --> 00:23:56,680
This.

422
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:59,240
Have you heard of White Flame Pterosaur?

423
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:08,040
Look at this investment agreement.

424
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:18,720
You can go to rest first.

425
00:24:19,760 --> 00:24:20,560
I'm not sleepy!

426
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,800
I'm afraid we still need to work for a long time.

427
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:24,280
It's okay.

428
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:26,680
Is there anything I can help you with?

429
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:28,080
Then please help me…

430
00:24:28,080 --> 00:24:29,800
Do your things by yourself.

431
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,960
Don't trouble my girl.

432
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,800
Sorry.

433
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:41,000
Are you hungry?

434
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,320
Let me cook something for you.

435
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:45,120
It's okay… Don't bother.

436
00:24:45,120 --> 00:24:46,240
Come on.

437
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,160
No… You really don't need to bother.

438
00:24:47,160 --> 00:24:48,440
We're specialists in different fields.

439
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:50,120
The world of kitchen is my oyster.

440
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,520
Do you want to rest for a while?

441
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:58,040
Okay, and I can go see Cang.

442
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:08,600
Cang…

443
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:17,880
Be careful that it'll bite you

444
00:25:17,880 --> 00:25:19,200
since you hold it in your hand like this.

445
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:21,000
It won't.

446
00:25:21,000 --> 00:25:22,320
I'm so close to it.

447
00:25:22,320 --> 00:25:23,680
Right, Cang?

448
00:25:23,680 --> 00:25:25,240
Do you miss me?

449
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:30,480
Good boy.

450
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,400
Why won't it bite her?

451
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:50,840
Noodles are ready?

452
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,720
What's wrong?

453
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,440
What happened?

454
00:26:17,400 --> 00:26:20,360
I don't like it when you cover other girls with blankets.

455
00:26:21,040 --> 00:26:22,480
I'm stingy.

456
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,280
Then you've covered her with it again.

457
00:26:26,640 --> 00:26:27,560
Are you feeling better now?

458
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:31,960
A little.

459
00:26:38,080 --> 00:26:42,720
Are you eating vinegar (means jealous in Chinese)?

460
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:53,640
I don't want to eat it.

461
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,280
Or, do you want some vinegar?

462
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:04,600
You really took it…

463
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:06,720
I've recorded it.

464
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:09,720
What?

465
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:11,800
I've recorded this lesson.

466
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:13,200
And I won't do it again.

467
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:17,040
Good boy.

468
00:27:19,320 --> 00:27:20,680
Good girl.

469
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,240
Guanjiu's sleeping!

470
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,920
Okay, then let's eat the noodles you make.

471
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,120
Seriously?

472
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:33,880
No…

473
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:38,160
Stop it! It's falling out!

474
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:40,640
Stop making fun of me.

475
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,520
Come on, no…

476
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:51,560
Shuji,

477
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:54,000
you have myriad book here.

478
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:56,800
Are there any one talking about investment?

479
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:58,000
As the old saying goes,

480
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
God helps those who help themselves.

481
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,320
You don't have that kind of gift.

482
00:28:01,320 --> 00:28:02,920
Just stop bothering.

483
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,040
I know!

484
00:28:05,320 --> 00:28:07,840
But Guanjiu and Bai Feili

485
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:09,120
work so late every day.

486
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,560
But I don't understand it at all.

487
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,280
There's nothing I could help them with.

488
00:28:12,280 --> 00:28:13,600
I feel bad about it.

489
00:28:14,040 --> 00:28:15,960
It's quite good to just loaf around.

490
00:28:22,080 --> 00:28:23,320
Bai Feili's stage play

491
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,920
is adapted from this comic book?

492
00:28:25,200 --> 00:28:26,480
Yes.

493
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:27,840
You've read it, too?

494
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:28,880
Sure!

495
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,120
But it's a pity that it stops updating.

496
00:28:31,480 --> 00:28:34,000
Hope in my life, I could see the end

497
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:36,040
of the story of the scholar and Liu Xichan.

498
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:38,760
Then come to see Dream of the South Ⅱ.

499
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:41,960
Any free ticket?

500
00:28:41,960 --> 00:28:42,480
No.

501
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,840
You even don't give up this little advantage?

502
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,800
Where are you now?

503
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,520
Here.

504
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,280
The third life, Liu Xichan went to release sky lanterns to make a wish.

505
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:56,000
This is my favorite chapter.

506
00:28:56,600 --> 00:28:59,040
That snow scene, those sky lanterns.

507
00:29:01,400 --> 00:29:03,640
Shuji, do you think there's a scientific basis

508
00:29:03,920 --> 00:29:05,160
for these sky lanterns?

509
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:06,480
Of course!

510
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:07,680
Every seemingly mysterious things

511
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:09,080
has a scientific basis.

512
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,720
Astrology is based on astronomy.

513
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,720
And alchemy is actually the rudiment of chemistry.

514
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,480
But once these sky lanterns are released,

515
00:29:16,480 --> 00:29:18,120
we just don't know where they will go.

516
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,960
How could we get them back

517
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:21,320
as the comic says?

518
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:24,120
You alone can't get them back.

519
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,040
But,

520
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,200
the old saying I mentioned just now

521
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:28,480
continues,

522
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,800
"People will help those who always help others."

523
00:29:30,800 --> 00:29:32,040
Since we're both the fan of this book,

524
00:29:32,040 --> 00:29:33,080
let me help you.

525
00:29:35,120 --> 00:29:37,240
Not this, and also not this.

526
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:41,960
This… This one is good.

527
00:29:42,400 --> 00:29:43,880
The mass of the sky lantern is 60 kg.

528
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,040
The lifter height and pressure

529
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,080
are related to that night's temperature.

530
00:29:47,080 --> 00:29:48,600
If so, then…

531
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:49,640
What follows is a batch of physical terms

532
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:51,160
that you can't understand at all.

533
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,520
M equals PGA.

534
00:29:53,520 --> 00:29:54,600
The maximum M.

535
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,440
The weather tonight is…

536
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,560
Northeast wind level three, and full moon.

537
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,680
Congratulations, it's completely the same as the setting of the book.

538
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:04,920
Right, it's probably in this area.

539
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,840
You can find the remains of sky lanterns there.

540
00:30:09,160 --> 00:30:10,080
Really?

541
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:12,520
Liu Xichan also didn't believe in the legend at the start.

542
00:30:12,520 --> 00:30:14,480
But she finally fulfilled her wish, didn't she?

543
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:16,720
That makes sense.

544
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:18,760
It's worth a try.

545
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,160
Then I'm going.

546
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:27,880
So smart I am!

547
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,720
I took tomorrow's weather!

548
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,400
Yu Fei! I got it wrong!

549
00:30:38,040 --> 00:30:39,480
Come on, make it clean!

550
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,120
Boss, see, everything's ready.

551
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:54,000
Nice.

552
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,400
Right, those complaints about noises

553
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:00,360
seem to have stopped.

554
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,960
It's said they were settled by the newcomer, Xiao Dao.

555
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:04,200
He's on good terms with those people,

556
00:31:04,200 --> 00:31:05,360
and always dance in the square

557
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:06,880
with neighbors there.

558
00:31:07,680 --> 00:31:10,160
Now, they all become our guests.

559
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:13,080
Well, see what kind of clients

560
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,520
that Xiao Dao has brought us.

561
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:15,920
Ridiculous!

562
00:31:16,720 --> 00:31:17,920
Call him to meet me later.

563
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:18,960
Yes, sir.

564
00:31:32,440 --> 00:31:34,120
Mr. Lou, they said you were looking for me.

565
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:35,080
Yes.

566
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,240
You promised me

567
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,360
the profit over one million yuan this month.

568
00:31:42,800 --> 00:31:44,160
How's it going now?

569
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:47,320
Almost there.

570
00:31:47,320 --> 00:31:49,040
I'll keep working hard in the remaining days.

571
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:50,920
Don't make a promise easily

572
00:31:50,920 --> 00:31:53,000
if you can't achieve it.

573
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:54,600
Otherwise you'll disgrace yourself.

574
00:31:55,280 --> 00:31:57,000
But for the problem that you failed to handle in the past two year,

575
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:58,800
he addressed it in one month.

576
00:31:59,080 --> 00:32:01,200
Our nightclub is next to a residential area.

577
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,160
We had received loads of complaints.

578
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:04,520
As the manager,

579
00:32:04,520 --> 00:32:05,800
you know the economic damage

580
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:07,400
better than anyone else.

581
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:09,440
Do you still remember how you promised me two years ago?

582
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:15,880
Xiao Dao.

583
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:19,400
You can quit working as salesperson now.

584
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,360
Our company now

585
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,600
needs a manager.

586
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,160
You're good at communicating with others.

587
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:32,000
Hope you can do it well in this position.

588
00:32:46,120 --> 00:32:47,120
Thank you, Mr. Lou.

589
00:32:47,800 --> 00:32:48,640
Go do your best.

590
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,360
Otherwise your face will be like his

591
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:52,320
next time you walk out.

592
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,480
I will surely not let you down.

593
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,960
I'll join a wine party on the 27th.

594
00:32:57,960 --> 00:32:59,240
You go with me then.

595
00:32:59,520 --> 00:32:59,920
Okay.

596
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,680
If there's nothing else,

597
00:33:03,880 --> 00:33:04,760
I'm going back to work.

598
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:05,440
Okay.

599
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:07,440
Wait!

600
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:11,400
Send the surveillance video of yesterday to me.

601
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,200
I'm going to check if the guests in the Room 8

602
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,360
were having fun.

603
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:16,040
Yes, sir.

604
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:17,440
You may go now.

605
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:17,920
Okay.

606
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:27,800
Then I'll go there now, madam.

607
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:31,320
Madam, want some wolfberries?

608
00:33:31,320 --> 00:33:32,400
-Yes… -Come on.

609
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,200
You're such a nice boy.

610
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:34,200
I'm flattered,

611
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:35,200
really.

612
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:39,440
Tonight's wolfberries are all on me!

613
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:40,600
I got a promotion!

614
00:33:40,600 --> 00:33:41,600
Congratulations!

615
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:44,800
Dao, do you have a girlfriend?

616
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:48,240
It's a pity that I'm still single.

617
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,040
But if you know any good girl,

618
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,560
please remember to introduce her to me!

619
00:33:53,560 --> 00:33:55,080
Then what kind of girl do you like?

620
00:33:58,480 --> 00:34:00,880
I like the girl who's straightforward and ill-tempered,

621
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:02,800
without fearing anything.

622
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:04,640
As for the character,

623
00:34:05,040 --> 00:34:06,440
she puts the one she loves before her friends.

624
00:34:06,640 --> 00:34:08,440
After she got a boyfriend, she just discarded you.

625
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,280
She didn't come back home or water the flowers.

626
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:12,400
Now she's even not answered my WeChat messages for many days.

627
00:34:12,400 --> 00:34:15,080
Dao, I think you're a nice guy.

628
00:34:15,080 --> 00:34:18,040
Quick-witted, brave and careful.

629
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:19,840
You often send us some small gifts.

630
00:34:19,840 --> 00:34:20,320
Right…

631
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:22,520
Then why do you like this kind of girl?

632
00:34:23,080 --> 00:34:24,199
You're right!

633
00:34:24,199 --> 00:34:26,040
It's really not worthwhile.

634
00:34:26,040 --> 00:34:27,120
-Then stop liking her! -Stop being friends with her.

635
00:34:27,120 --> 00:34:28,040
-Break with her right away. -Right!

636
00:34:28,040 --> 00:34:28,600
Yes!

637
00:34:29,480 --> 00:34:31,880
Right! Break with her! I'm going to do it now!

638
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:34,000
[Yu Fei]

639
00:34:31,880 --> 00:34:32,800
Block her.

640
00:34:34,480 --> 00:34:35,679
I've been friends

641
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,719
with her for nearly 20 years.

642
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:39,560
Anyway, I should inform her.

643
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:40,280
Inform.

644
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:41,840
He still doesn't want to break with her.

645
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,159
What are you doing?

646
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:49,120
I'm going to release sky lanterns. What's up?

647
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,010
[Wait for me. I'm Going to Break with You.]

648
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,640
I think I should say it to her face to face.

649
00:34:59,640 --> 00:35:00,480
Face to face.

650
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,320
Yes.

651
00:35:01,880 --> 00:35:03,480
Then I'm leaving, madams.

652
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:05,040
-Okay. -See you.

653
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,360
See you around!

654
00:35:06,360 --> 00:35:07,920
Bye-bye! Take care!

655
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,120
-Okay… -Thank you! You're welcome at any time!

656
00:35:11,120 --> 00:35:12,240
Take care!

657
00:35:28,560 --> 00:35:30,720
I don't know where the reference you mentioned is.

658
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,440
So I just fetch you all those books

659
00:35:32,440 --> 00:35:33,840
on the second and third shelves.

660
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:35,080
There are too many of them!

661
00:35:35,080 --> 00:35:36,320
Come to check!

662
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,080
I'm sorry…

663
00:35:40,080 --> 00:35:40,920
It's okay.

664
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,920
-I didn't see you. -It's okay.

665
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,160
Where are you going in such a hurry?

666
00:35:45,720 --> 00:35:47,840
Well, t-the house I rent has a water leak.

667
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:48,840
I'm going to check it.

668
00:35:48,840 --> 00:35:49,840
I'll go with you.

669
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:53,040
You have to hand in the business plan

670
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:54,560
tomorrow, right?

671
00:35:54,840 --> 00:35:56,280
Now Dream of the South Ⅱ is the top priority.

672
00:35:57,920 --> 00:35:59,400
Then after I finish it tomorrow,

673
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,000
let's go have a date.

674
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,640
Remember to rest early.

675
00:36:06,960 --> 00:36:07,880
I'm going.

676
00:36:08,240 --> 00:36:09,240
Sorry, Guanjiu!

677
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:09,720
It's okay.

678
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:10,400
-I'm going, bye-bye!

679
00:36:10,400 --> 00:36:11,040
Bye-bye.

680
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,280
You can go back to rest, too.

681
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:17,800
I'll handle

682
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,360
the rest of them later.

683
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,080
Didn't you tell that thing

684
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:30,120
to her?

685
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:38,160
There are so many pages of it hidden here.

686
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:42,360
Collect them well.

687
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:44,480
Bye.

688
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,440
Yu Fei,

689
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:43,000
I'm going to break with you.

690
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,640
Yu Fei,

691
00:37:46,960 --> 00:37:48,080
we're finished.

692
00:37:50,760 --> 00:37:51,680
Yu Fei,

693
00:37:52,040 --> 00:37:54,120
I plan to break with you.

694
00:37:55,200 --> 00:37:56,040
Not like that…

695
00:37:56,960 --> 00:37:57,920
Yu Fei!

696
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:59,120
Wang Zhongqiang!

697
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:02,240
Why are you so mad?

698
00:38:02,240 --> 00:38:04,520
What are you mumbling about?

699
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:08,000
I've bought you the drink you love.

700
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,560
Do you think I'll let it go

701
00:38:11,560 --> 00:38:13,160
just because of this bribery of drink?

702
00:38:14,080 --> 00:38:16,160
Let go of what?

703
00:38:16,680 --> 00:38:18,560
Our friendship is going to end.

704
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,280
I not only bought one for myself.

705
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,360
I also prepared it for you.

706
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:25,000
You can pick the one you like first.

707
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,040
Were it not for me,

708
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:29,880
you would have come here alone!

709
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,320
Where's your boyfriend…

710
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:36,080
Where's that Bai?

711
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,080
Did you break up with him so soon?

712
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:40,440
What are you talking about?

713
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:44,560
He has a really crucial affair tomorrow, and now he's still busy with it.

714
00:38:45,080 --> 00:38:47,120
Girlfriend should be the first priority now matter how busy he is!

715
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,480
See?

716
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:50,000
Usually I'm also so busy, okay?

717
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:51,080
But as I heard that you'd release sky lanterns,

718
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:52,200
I just came here immediately.

719
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:54,680
So you're my real pal.

720
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
But if you really have some work to do,

721
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:58,280
just go ahead.

722
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,800
I can release them by myself.

723
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:02,360
Come on, I'm already here.

724
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:06,400
After all, I also have a wish to make.

725
00:39:06,760 --> 00:39:07,800
Then what are you waiting for?

726
00:39:07,800 --> 00:39:08,640
Let's go now!

727
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,160
Don't miss the auspicious time! Let's go!

728
00:39:11,160 --> 00:39:13,040
Why do you have to choose this place so late at night?

729
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,520
I've found Shuji to calculate it.

730
00:39:14,520 --> 00:39:16,200
It should be this place! Come on!

731
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:21,440
Here you are! Write down your wish on it.

732
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:23,400
And then tie it to the sky lantern.

733
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:33,080
No peeking!

734
00:39:34,200 --> 00:39:35,840
I just want to see if your handwriting

735
00:39:35,840 --> 00:39:37,680
is still that ugly as usual.

736
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:40,280
I've already known your wish.

737
00:39:43,320 --> 00:39:44,760
What do you know?

738
00:39:46,560 --> 00:39:49,320
Make a fortune, and find a beautiful girlfriend.

739
00:39:49,320 --> 00:39:52,080
It's been your wish since you were eight, right?

740
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:57,400
I have to say that society didn't give me a chance to experience difficulties.

741
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,400
I've realized half of my goal

742
00:39:59,400 --> 00:40:00,720
before 30 years old.

743
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:04,240
Which girl is that unfortunately?

744
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:08,400
What a pity, it's the other half of my wish.

745
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,920
I got a promotion, and I'm now the manager.

746
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:15,800
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

747
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:19,400
I didn't bring anything today.

748
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,400
After we finish this, let's go to your shop and open a bottle of wine.

749
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:25,240
I'm now

750
00:40:25,240 --> 00:40:27,360
the man who only opens the wine of God Dragon set.

751
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,920
Can you afford it?

752
00:40:29,400 --> 00:40:30,600
I'm also the people

753
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:33,120
who has tens of thousands of yuan in savings.

754
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:34,960
Let me spend everything I have

755
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:37,040
to open a bottle of wine to celebrate for you.

756
00:40:38,920 --> 00:40:40,880
But, seeing you succeed,

757
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:42,400
I'm really proud of you.

758
00:40:45,120 --> 00:40:47,080
All right… Release them and let's go.

759
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:48,240
It must be uneasy to call a taxi here.

760
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,800
No… Well, time is not right.

761
00:40:52,800 --> 00:40:54,720
They must be released from 11 p.m. to 1 a.m.

762
00:40:54,720 --> 00:40:55,880
There's still a while left.

763
00:40:55,880 --> 00:40:56,840
Must be that careful and accurate?

764
00:40:56,840 --> 00:40:58,040
Of course!

765
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:00,200
And the comic book also says,

766
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:02,040
it's not the end when we release these lanterns.

767
00:41:02,040 --> 00:41:04,080
We'd get the remains of sky lanterns

768
00:41:04,080 --> 00:41:05,440
and take this card off

769
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:06,520
to make it into a talisman.

770
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:07,920
Carry it with us all the time,

771
00:41:07,920 --> 00:41:09,680
until this wish comes true.

772
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:11,120
Then that's the end.

773
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:12,480
So complicated!

774
00:41:12,760 --> 00:41:13,960
Sure!

775
00:41:14,520 --> 00:41:16,880
It's not that easy to fulfill your wish.

776
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:18,760
Write it now.

777
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,280
Don't miss the time.

778
00:41:36,290 --> 00:41:38,260
[Please Make Bai Feili's Dream Come True,
And Let Him Get Investment Successfully]

779
00:41:47,880 --> 00:41:49,480
It's almost time! Get ready!

780
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:53,600
Why didn't you ignite?

781
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:56,600
If they fly in different directions,

782
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:57,800
which one should we chase for?

783
00:41:58,880 --> 00:42:00,800
Are you making sacrifice?

784
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:02,640
Then… What about your wish?

785
00:42:03,600 --> 00:42:04,600
My…

786
00:42:05,600 --> 00:42:06,040
Give it to me.

787
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:16,360
Nice.

788
00:42:16,960 --> 00:42:17,960
It's still going smoothly.

789
00:42:18,240 --> 00:42:19,160
It looks quite beautiful.

790
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:28,640
Chase for it!

791
00:42:28,840 --> 00:42:29,680
What are you waiting for?

792
00:42:29,680 --> 00:42:30,480
Let's go now!

793
00:42:38,440 --> 00:42:39,520
Slow down! Mind your step!

794
00:42:39,520 --> 00:42:41,360
It's flying that way! Run!

795
00:42:44,000 --> 00:42:45,360
Why is it going in that direction?

796
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:46,880
Do you want to die?

797
00:42:47,640 --> 00:42:50,160
Why is it suddenly flying that way?

798
00:42:50,440 --> 00:42:51,320
You really have no confidence

799
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:52,880
in your exam result?

800
00:42:53,040 --> 00:42:54,200
You already performed on the open stage!

801
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,800
How could those brats possibly surpass you?

802
00:42:55,960 --> 00:42:57,880
It's not because of my exam!

803
00:42:57,880 --> 00:42:58,560
It's…

804
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:04,680
You can't catch up with it.

805
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,160
It's not the end.

806
00:43:12,440 --> 00:43:14,080
Why is it slowly falling down?

807
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:15,800
Is the candle burning out?

808
00:43:17,480 --> 00:43:18,720
Even if it's burning out,

809
00:43:19,200 --> 00:43:20,400
it'll fall into the river.

810
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:28,600
Forget about it!

811
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:41,160
Come on, I'll take you to chase for it.
