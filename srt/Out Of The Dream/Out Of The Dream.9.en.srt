[Episode 9]

4
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:48,360
What is there to be happy with?

5
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,039
Tomorrow I'll make a surprise attack.

6
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:56,880
I don't think I can't

7
00:01:56,880 --> 00:01:58,600
unmask the love-rat.

8
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,040
Xiao Zhu, I need you tomorrow.

9
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:09,440
Manager,

10
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,560
it's all done.

11
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,520
What is it with you guys?

12
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:12,360
It's noisy every day.

13
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,280
How can we sleep?

14
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,200
What's going on out there?

15
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:15,920
You make noise all day long.

16
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:17,040
It really disturbs us.

17
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,200
Old people nearby come again.

18
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,720
They complain about the noise we make.

19
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:22,760
Their complaint is not a day or two.

20
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:23,840
Leave them alone.

21
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:26,160
Can you do some changes?

22
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,160
Can you think for us?

23
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,440
That's it. Mind your work.

24
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,120
Just forget it.

25
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:30,840
Come on. Go! Please go.

26
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:50,040
We are lurking

27
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,000
not posing.

28
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:53,760
Follow me.

29
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:14,120
Dao Ge.

30
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:16,160
Someone over there.

31
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:29,120
Don't butt me.

32
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:29,840
To the left.

33
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,079
I mean left, not right.

34
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:36,720
You really have a poor sense of direction.

35
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:37,480
Go.

36
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:40,720
One, two, one. OK. Great.

37
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:42,000
Stop butting me.

38
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:45,520
What's wrong?

39
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,280
I can't do it.

40
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,600
I can't. I'm too exhausted.

41
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:50,760
A little impatience spoils a great plan.

42
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,120
Hold on.

43
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:00,640
Lower down. Lower down.

44
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,640
One, two, one, two.

45
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,960
Move back now.

46
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,760
Don't, don't shake it.

47
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:10,440
My, my, my feet.

48
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:11,680
Zhuang Sheng.

49
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:14,560
Put down your work.

50
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:16,079
Can I check your blueprint

51
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,880
you showed me before?

52
00:04:18,079 --> 00:04:19,640
What will the final scene be like?

53
00:04:20,839 --> 00:04:22,760
The most passionate scene

54
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:24,600
with all light bulbs up

55
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:25,240
reaches the climax.

56
00:04:25,240 --> 00:04:26,320
It's him.

57
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:29,520
Dao Ge. Your rival shows up.

58
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:30,360
Change it.

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:31,520
Make all lights off.

60
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,880
I must get something on him today.

61
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:34,440
and add a line of cold fireworks.

62
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,159
Will it be better?

63
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:37,840
Copy that. Boss.

64
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:45,520
Zhu, I'm tired.

65
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:46,600
You rise to have a look.

66
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,360
Alright.

67
00:04:50,680 --> 00:04:51,480
Guanshan.

68
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:55,560
Where's your girlfriend?

69
00:04:56,520 --> 00:04:57,280
She's studying at home.

70
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,400
There's a woman.

71
00:04:58,680 --> 00:04:59,120
What?

72
00:04:59,120 --> 00:04:59,800
Thanks.

73
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:00,520
Let me see.

74
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:02,760
It is said that

75
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:05,240
people newly in love are not very used to

76
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,200
being called boyfriend or girlfriend.

77
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:09,760
You get used to it so quickly.

78
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,400
Are you living alone

79
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,360
or sharing a house with roommates?

80
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:17,200
Why do you ask?

81
00:05:17,480 --> 00:05:18,600
Is the rehearsal studio

82
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,560
not big enough for props?

83
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:22,160
Dao Ge, you'll be found out.

84
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:23,400
I meant to care for safety

85
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:25,520
for a girl living alone.

86
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,480
I almost forgot the business.

87
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,480
Dragon Scale needs a wig.

88
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:31,760
I have

89
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:33,840
designed a few. Take a look.

90
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:35,560
Let me see.

91
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:37,360
The first one is darker.

92
00:05:53,320 --> 00:05:54,240
Keep your hands away!

93
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:56,760
Do you treat Yu Fei fairly!

94
00:05:58,159 --> 00:05:59,120
Who's that?

95
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,800
Wang Zhongqiang.

96
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:03,760
Why are you here?

97
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,560
Who's that? Do you know him?

98

[Super Spicy Dandan Noodles]

99
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:09,000
An old friend.

100
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:10,640
I come for instant noodles.

101
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,760
Dao Ge, they seem to get flustered.

102
00:06:23,240 --> 00:06:24,520
Here you are.

103
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,120
Coming.

104
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:30,240
Let me introduce.

105
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:33,000
This is Dao Ge, my childhood friend.

106
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,960
This is Bai Feili, my...

107
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:35,920
Boyfriend.

108
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,920
Get me some lamb.

109
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:45,080
Don't you have legs?

110
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:57,440
We met in Suzhou.

111
00:06:58,400 --> 00:06:59,280
I remember you.

112
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:01,680
I remember you too.

113
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:20,360
After that, we met once again.

114
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,560
You were in the car.

115
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:24,480
Yu Fei and I stood outside.

116
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,800
That time...

117
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:30,200
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:34,920
Today, she didn't see what you do.

119
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:35,920
I won't tell her.

120
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,000
But I'll continue to

121
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,360
keep my eyes on you.

122
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:41,159
If you dare to hurt her,

123
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:41,880
I won't give you

124
00:07:41,880 --> 00:07:43,280
another chance to apologize.

125
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,640
If you don't feel badly,

126
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:47,920
then keep going on.

127
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,120
I'll not give up.

128
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:53,000
Only a loser will say that.

129
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,400
What are you talking about?

130
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:58,080
We're talking about you.

131
00:07:58,080 --> 00:07:59,760
About me? What's that?

132
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:01,240
Something stupid you did as a kid.

133
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,800
Let's have a drink first.

134
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:44,720
Here.

135
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:45,680
Slowly, slowly.

136
00:08:54,760 --> 00:08:56,480
How could he drink so much?

137
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:57,880
What's his background?

138
00:08:57,880 --> 00:08:59,280
He lives alone in such a big house.

139
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,600
It's his grandparents' house.

140
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:03,640
You've already met his family.

141
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:05,280
Oh, well.

142
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:06,720
I met your family

143
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:07,880
twenty years ago.

144
00:09:10,840 --> 00:09:11,560
Lend me a hand.

145
00:09:12,280 --> 00:09:13,080
Behave yourself.

146
00:09:13,080 --> 00:09:14,400
How can you help a man take off clothes?

147
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:15,720
Leave it to me.

148
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:23,120
Why did you go to Jiubai today?

149
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:28,840
Why didn't you tell me

150
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:30,680
you have a boyfriend?

151
00:09:31,520 --> 00:09:32,320
Your mother won't rest easy

152
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:33,720
without me by your side.

153
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,080
Besides

154
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:36,560
You're not a shrewd girl.

155
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:37,920
What if you are cheated?

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:39,840
But

157
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:41,920
I don't have money.

158
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:43,120
What does he want from me?

159
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:45,800
He can cheat you for other things.

160
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:48,880
Be quiet.

161
00:09:49,280 --> 00:09:51,080
You're still inexperienced in society.

162
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:56,560
What are you doing?

163
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,120
Pillow. Don't move.

164
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:01,240
I'll get you some water.

165
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:02,480
You are the pillow.

166
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,120
Your family are all pillows.

167
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:05,560
Get away.

168
00:10:05,560 --> 00:10:06,600
Yu Fei. Help me.

169
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,200
Bai Feili.

170
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,080
Get away. You get excited, don't you?

171
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:37,000
OK. Done.

172
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,000
Why does this guy have no closet?

173
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,440
Why did you roll him up like this?

174
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:03,640
Xiao Bai.

175
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:05,640
Call him Xiao Bai

176
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:07,280

00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:11,000
The movement can be delegated to the stunt.

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,960
What's your idea?

352
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:15,280
It's fine.

353
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:17,760
Let her do, if she wants.

354
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,680
We have to give a chance to people who want popularity.

355
00:20:20,680 --> 00:20:21,640
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

356
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:24,520
But I think it should be a little harder

357
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:27,640
to match my character as a chivalrous swordswoman.

358
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:29,840
It should be like

359
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:31,680
swinging through the air

360
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:32,800
and then falling off

361
00:20:32,800 --> 00:20:33,960
more severely.

362
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:35,520
In this case, the audience

363
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:37,000
will feel sympathy.

364
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:37,680
Ah...

365
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:40,560
Can you do this?

366
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,080
OK.

367
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:42,920
Good.

368
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:44,400
Miss Lingjiu.

369
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:46,160
Have a break now.

370
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:47,960
Please take a seat.

371
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,440
Follow me.

372
00:20:49,920 --> 00:20:51,360
Hurry up.

373
00:20:53,680 --> 00:20:55,360
Shall we have a rest nearby?

374
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:56,120
No.

375
00:21:12,920 --> 00:21:14,720
I'll take it that you agree.

376
00:21:23,750 --> 00:21:26,020
[Shanghai Huahai Studios]

377
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:29,960
What is she doing there?

378
00:21:31,040 --> 00:21:32,520
Wire rope gets ready.

379
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:33,400
Check it.

380
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:34,320
Okay.

381
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,800
Extras stand by.

382
00:21:35,800 --> 00:21:36,640
Is that okay?

383
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:37,280
Yes.

384
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:41,440
Is the wire rope ready?

385
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:42,600
Done.

386
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,320
Good. Actress stands by.

387
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:45,280
Done. Director.

388
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:47,760
Cameras ready? Camera!

389
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:49,400
Cameras ready. We can start.

390
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:51,640
OK. Everybody ready.

391
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,080
OK.

392
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,120
Put it away.

393
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:54,760
I see.

394
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:55,360
Let's go.

395
00:21:58,160 --> 00:21:58,920
Is that okay?

396
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,520
Thank you. It's okay.

397
00:22:00,520 --> 00:22:01,640
Good.

398
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,680
Done.

399
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:07,000
It's ready. Director.

400
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Shoot.

401
00:22:15,440 --> 00:22:17,200
One, two, three. Go!

402
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:47,080
Go. Go. Hurry!

403
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:47,840
Hurry up!

404
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:51,520
Are you alright?

405
00:22:51,880 --> 00:22:52,680
Yu Fei, are you OK?

406
00:22:53,840 --> 00:22:54,440
Yu Fei.

407
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,520
Untie her wire rope.

408
00:22:57,880 --> 00:22:59,160
It must have been quite a fall.

409
00:22:59,160 --> 00:23:00,160
Quite a fall.

410
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:02,400
Is she insured?

411
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:04,280
Staff, bring a stretcher!

412
00:23:04,280 --> 00:23:05,640
Where are the people! Hurry up!

413
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:32,200
Yu Fei.

414
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:34,560
Yu Fei.

415
00:23:35,800 --> 00:23:36,840
Yu Fei.

416
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:39,280
Yu Fei.

417
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:43,200
Can you move?

418
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,200
Why are you here?

419
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,960
Let me get you out of here.

420
00:23:50,760 --> 00:23:51,560
Be careful.

421
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,360
Put me down.

422
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,120
So many people around.

423
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:06,600
Stop that.

424
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:08,520
Wait. Wait.

425
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:12,360
I seem to have a fracture somewhere.

426
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:14,240
Put me down. Let me try to walk.

427
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:27,360
I'm fine.

428
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,440
We've been practicing since a young age.

429
00:24:32,440 --> 00:24:34,400
We frequently suffer from falling or hitting.

430
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,440
It's not a big deal at all.

431
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,480
Here is what you called the sea of books.

432
00:24:40,640 --> 00:24:42,440
It's really crisis-ridden.

433
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,440
Look, I'm not hurt at all.

434
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,800
Besides, I only have one last shot left.

435
00:24:50,800 --> 00:24:51,760
After the shot,

436
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:53,200
I can get my pay.

437
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:53,960
Otherwise,

438
00:24:53,960 --> 00:24:56,120
I've worked all day for nothing.

439
00:24:57,000 --> 00:24:58,880
How much do you need? I can give you.

440
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:03,800
Nothing wrong with my body.

441
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,720
Why should I take your money?

442
00:25:06,280 --> 00:25:08,200
Do you realize your exam is next week?

443
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:09,960
Now you waste your time

444
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:11,240
to work for peanuts.

445
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,560
Are you going to get a zero

446
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,840
in the professional exams?

447
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:17,480
If I can't afford the fee,

448
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:19,400
what is full marks good for?

449
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,000
Yu Fei.

450
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,120
Yu Fei.

451
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,680
Director.

452
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:36,920
How are you now?

453
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:39,080
I'm all right.

454
00:25:40,520 --> 00:25:41,440
Can we move on?

455
00:25:42,120 --> 00:25:42,840
Yes.

456
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:44,680
Come over.

457
00:25:44,680 --> 00:25:45,720
It won't break this time.

458
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:48,320
Be ready. The stunt is coming.

459
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:54,760
Yu Fei.

460
00:25:56,160 --> 00:25:57,160
-Be quick. -Coming.

461
00:26:10,040 --> 00:26:11,640
Okay. The makeup is almost removed.

462
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:12,600
Thanks.

463
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:13,280
You're welcome.

464
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:21,320
Thank you so much.

465
00:26:22,160 --> 00:26:23,320
I need to apologize

466
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,800
for the accident.

467
00:26:24,800 --> 00:26:25,760
It almost made you hurt.

468
00:26:27,040 --> 00:26:28,000
Never mind.

469
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:30,520
Doing the stunt is more or less risky.

470
00:26:31,080 --> 00:26:32,440
I was prepared for this.

471
00:26:32,440 --> 00:26:33,720
Anyway,

472
00:26:34,560 --> 00:26:35,680
Anyway, you've worked hard.

473
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,240
You did a great job.

474
00:26:37,240 --> 00:26:39,240
Very professional. Next time...

475
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:40,240
There's no next time.

476
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:41,720
I'll do all my own stunts.

477
00:26:42,360 --> 00:26:43,160
And this person,

478
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:44,560
I don't want to see her anymore.

479
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:45,720
Miss Lingjiu.

480
00:26:51,080 --> 00:26:52,760
I don't know where you got this person.

481
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:55,040
Please find someone more professional,

482
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,120
at least acceptable next time.

483
00:27:12,040 --> 00:27:12,600
What do you want?

484
00:27:12,840 --> 00:27:13,640
I don't understand it.

485
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:16,280
What are you doing! Yu Fei, you're crazy!

486
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,440
That's what you use to do evil,

487
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:20,720
huh?

488
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:22,840
Let go of me!

489
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:26,040
What do you two want to play on me?

490
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:28,000
We two?

491
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,480
Bai Feili came to me just now,

492
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:32,760
don't you know?

493
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,080
How...how can you come in?

494
00:27:41,360 --> 00:27:42,760
Can you leave us alone?

495
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:53,080
I know you've been together.

496
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,080
You don't have to display affection here.

497
00:27:58,680 --> 00:27:59,640
Ah, lawyer's letter.

498
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:01,280
So what?

499
00:28:01,720 --> 00:28:03,200
Is it a crime to like you?

500
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:05,480
You've been on spot here for a month.

501
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,640
Don't you know the property belongs to Shang&Shan Group?

502
00:28:09,400 --> 00:28:11,240
I can check surveillance videos whenever I want.

503
00:28:11,760 --> 00:28:13,160
I just played a trick on her.

504
00:28:14,680 --> 00:28:16,040
Don't you see

505
00:28:16,040 --> 00:28:17,440
in the videos that

506
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:18,960
I laid more mattresses for her?

507
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:22,600
What you did has constituted

508
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,400
attempted murder.

509
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:25,520
According to the law,

510
00:28:26,240 --> 00:28:27,560
at least a sentence of 3 years.

511
00:28:27,920 --> 00:28:29,760
You were not like this before.

512
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,000
You didn't know me before.

513
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,360
And you don't need to know me anymore.

514
00:28:34,560 --> 00:28:35,640
However, remember.

515
00:28:36,240 --> 00:28:37,840
If you dare to hurt Yu Fei again,

516
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:40,240
say goodbye to your shooting.

517
00:28:41,320 --> 00:28:43,480
Are you really gonna do this to me for this woman?

518
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:44,520
Yes.

519
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:47,480
And if

520
00:28:47,960 --> 00:28:50,160
such kind of things happen again,

521
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:53,480
you'll receive a summons

522
00:28:54,560 --> 00:28:55,880
not a warning.

523
00:28:59,640 --> 00:29:01,240
I've told you everything. Let go of me.

524
00:29:04,680 --> 00:29:06,520
Thank you for taking care of me.

525
00:29:07,880 --> 00:29:09,120
Especially for this.

526
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,360
You don't need to come to me anymore.

527
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:14,720
And I won't do the job again.

528
00:29:19,080 --> 00:29:21,000
Guanshan is just seized by a whim to be with you.

529
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:22,800
You're completely from two different worlds.

530
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,160
Nothing to see here!

531
00:29:38,880 --> 00:29:40,400
Come on.

532
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:46,200
Yu Fei.

533
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:52,880
You haven't left yet.

534
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,600
Well.

535
00:29:57,040 --> 00:29:58,440
Can't I take her home

536
00:29:58,440 --> 00:29:59,920
if I quarreled with my girlfriend?

537
00:30:01,120 --> 00:30:01,720
Let's go.

538
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,240
Are you happy today, honey?

539
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,440
What made you think of buying me flowers?

540
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,920
I'll give you flowers every day.

541
00:30:44,920 --> 00:30:45,800
You said it. Don't forget.

542
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:46,840
Of course. That's for sure.

543
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:48,080
Keep your promise.

544
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:48,760
I promise.

545
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:58,480
Your feet.

546
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,920
What are you going to do?

547
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:04,960
What do you think I'm gonna do?

548
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:12,680
These are the best shoes

549
00:31:12,680 --> 00:31:13,960
I could find around here.

550
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,560
At least change what you are wearing.

551
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:18,440
You can wear the new ones when practising.

552
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:22,960
It's all right.

553
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:32,360
Let me do it myself.

554
00:31:32,360 --> 00:31:33,240
Relax.

555
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:35,280
Just sit there.

556
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,440
It is said that giving shoes means...

557
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,000
No matter where you go,

558
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,640
I'll get you back.

559
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:46,920
I wanted to say that

560
00:31:49,080 --> 00:31:51,160
it means going with you forever.

561
00:32:01,360 --> 00:32:02,200
I just hope

562
00:32:03,280 --> 00:32:04,800
you can reach everywhere you want

563
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,640
with less hard work

564
00:32:08,200 --> 00:32:09,160
and with me.

565
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,280
Besides,

566
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,880
I don't want the quarrel between us

567
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:14,800
will last till tomorrow.

568
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,160
For you.

569
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:32,760
Since my childhood,

570
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:34,280
I have to work harder than others

571
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,440
to get anything I want.

572
00:32:38,920 --> 00:32:41,120
It seems the whole world is telling me

573
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,960
everything is entirely conditional.

574
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,440
It's hard though,

575
00:32:49,600 --> 00:32:51,920
with some curiosity

576
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:53,360
and tenacity,

577
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,920
I never stop my footstep.

578
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,240
Well.

579
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,280
From now on,

580
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,120
let me go with you.

581
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:06,680
Whether to send you shoes

582
00:33:06,680 --> 00:33:08,240
when you need them,

583
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:09,440
or have ice creams together

584
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,280
when you get tired.

585
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,240
Let's go together.

586
00:33:21,520 --> 00:33:23,200
Neither you pull me along,

587
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:24,800
nor you carry me on your back.

588
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:27,400
We'll go ahead

589
00:33:27,880 --> 00:33:29,640
shoulder to shoulder.

590
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,080
And...

591
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:35,760
you're still Bai Feili.

592
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,360
I'm still Yu Fei.

593
00:33:38,440 --> 00:33:39,720
Even if one day,

594
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,600
I feel tired, get hurt or fall over

595
00:33:43,320 --> 00:33:44,920
I'm gonna stand up on my own,

596
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:47,000
instead of

597
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,480
waiting for your help every time.

598
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:53,160
To accept help

599
00:33:53,520 --> 00:33:55,360
is also a kind of ability.

600
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:58,320
And I won't stand on ceremony either.

601
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,880
I'll often come to trouble you.

602
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:02,840
For example,

603
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,200
please move to Zhan Garden.

604
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:10,480
Clearly

605
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:12,920
you're saving my money on rent.

606
00:34:13,560 --> 00:34:15,480
Well, I'm troubling you.

607
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,080
No.

608
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,600
I need you.

609
00:34:21,440 --> 00:34:23,199
Either tuition fee

610
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,280
or part-time jobs,

611
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:25,960
show weakness like me

612
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:27,560
whenever you need help.

613
00:34:28,560 --> 00:34:29,800
Who's not afraid to show weakness

614
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,560
is truly strong.

615
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,080
Accustomed to being alone.

616
00:34:33,760 --> 00:34:35,560
Accustomed not to owing other.

617
00:34:36,080 --> 00:34:37,800
I never thought I'd meet you.

618
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,840
It's hard to figure out who owes more.

619
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,239
And there's no need for us to figure it out.

620
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,920
Deal! Cheers with ice cream.

621
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,600
Your English is improving.

622
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,280
The exam is the day after tomorrow.

623
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:57,680
Teacher Xiao Bai,

624
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:00,240
do you have any plans for the sprint?

625
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:04,200
Before major surgery,

626
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:05,640
anesthesia is usually required.

627
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,000
Therefore,

628
00:35:08,400 --> 00:35:09,600
take it easy for a day

629
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,600
and think of nothing.

630
00:35:11,960 --> 00:35:13,480
Take the exam at ease in that day.

631
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:17,160
I'm called the Green Channel to famous universities.

632
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:18,600
Don't worry.

633
00:36:21,800 --> 00:36:24,360
He was so tall even at the age of 17.

634
00:36:42,520 --> 00:36:45,990
[Bai Feili Yu Fei]

635
00:36:49,840 --> 00:36:51,720
What a mess!

636
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,360
M.

637
00:37:05,160 --> 00:37:06,240
Shan Lao.

638
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:07,800
Can you manage it?

639
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,400
Can I manage it?

640
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,640
I was teaching Introduction to Electric Power

641
00:37:11,640 --> 00:37:13,200
before your mother was born.

642
00:37:13,880 --> 00:37:16,400
But practice is not the same thing as theory.

643
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:17,520
It's too messy.

644
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:18,480
Kid.

645
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:21,000
Don't question your grandma,

646
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
my wife's capability.

647
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:25,440
Wife, cocktail.

648
00:37:25,640 --> 00:37:26,120
Thank you.

649
00:37:26,120 --> 00:37:27,760
Please don't bother yourself

650
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,160
to argue with a liberal arts boy.

651
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:29,920
I see.

652
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:34,280
Shang Lao, aren't you a professor of Chinese Language?

653
00:37:36,440 --> 00:37:37,040
You...

654
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:37,960
Bai Feili.

655
00:37:39,120 --> 00:37:40,200
Bai Feili.

656
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:41,760
Warning. Warning.

657
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:43,080
Q...quilt, quilt, quilt.

658
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,720
Pull up the quilt.

659
00:37:43,720 --> 00:37:45,240
Bai Feili.

660
00:37:45,640 --> 00:37:46,760
Bai Feili.

661
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,120
What are you doing now?

662
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:52,960
Massage.

663
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,080
Yeah, massage.

664
00:37:57,080 --> 00:37:58,080
It's such a nice day.

665
00:37:58,080 --> 00:37:58,880
So comfortable.

666
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:00,640
We should enjoy the sunshine and beach.

667
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,920
Massage?

668
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:03,920
Let me join you.

669
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:07,920
It's okay.

670
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,200
The only task for you today

671
00:38:10,520 --> 00:38:11,720
is to have a good relax.

672
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:14,600
Go out to relax.

673
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:18,360
Have a good relax.

674
00:38:19,360 --> 00:38:20,320
Byebye.

675
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,040
Ouch! That hurt!

676
00:38:22,040 --> 00:38:23,600
Get up. Get up.

677
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,560
Does it hurt?

678
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:25,480
Hurt?

679
00:38:25,480 --> 00:38:26,960
You also know it hurts.

680
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:28,880
I'm lying on the "rocks".

681
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:34,280
Cocktail. Cocktail. Cocktail.

682
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:40,320
Why do you suddenly call me to go shopping?

683
00:38:40,680 --> 00:38:42,080
Guanjiu said you are nervous before the exam.

684
00:38:42,080 --> 00:38:43,280
So we take you out to relax.

685
00:38:44,200 --> 00:38:45,320
Are you sure?

686
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,600
I haven't seen much of cartoons.

687
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:50,840
I never thought there would be a street for cartoon-lovers.

688
00:38:52,040 --> 00:38:54,400
Ah, did you even watch Black Cat Sheriff

689
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:55,520
or Calabash Brothers?

690
00:38:55,840 --> 00:38:57,120
No.

691
00:38:57,120 --> 00:38:59,440
When I was a kid, my mom didn't allow me to watch TV.

692
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,840
At home, I could only

693
00:39:01,840 --> 00:39:03,840
listen to Chinese operas with her.

694
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,240
Later on I started to act in a opera in the troupe.

695
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,320
The few character I knew around that time

696
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,080
were ones of sheng, dan, jing, mo and chou.

697
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:11,800
Did Guanshan recommend something to you?

698
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,280
He won't strongly recommend anything.

699
00:39:15,600 --> 00:39:16,800
But we will talk about

700
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:17,840
what I'm interested in.

701
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,240
Recently, I've been reading

702
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:22,200
Full Metal?

703
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:25,160
Do you refer to Fullmetal Alchemist?

704
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:29,880
He never lends this book to others.

705
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,120
You read this book at his house.

706
00:39:34,360 --> 00:39:37,120
I said you're sure to live with Boss.

707
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,680
What a house of romance!

708
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:41,320
Do you have any sweet details?

709
00:39:43,240 --> 00:39:47,480
The detail is memorizing words and memorizing words.

710
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:50,000
It's like living with my headteacher.

711
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:52,720
Boss treats his girlfriend

712
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:53,800
the same as friends.

713
00:39:53,800 --> 00:39:57,040
As cool and ruthless as the winter.

714
00:40:00,240 --> 00:40:01,800
It's so handsome!

715
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,360
Yukito!

716
00:40:06,080 --> 00:40:08,280
Come on. Every time you see it,

717
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,080
you'll be fangirling for 10 minutes.

718
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:12,240
But every time I see it,

719
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:13,840
I'll think it's so handsome.

720
00:40:14,320 --> 00:40:17,760
No, it becomes more handsome each time.

721
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,560
As soon as I finish the Dragon Scale,

722
00:40:19,560 --> 00:40:20,880
I'll take you home.

723
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:23,600
Who's that?

724
00:40:24,520 --> 00:40:27,000
My only Prince Charming in Japanese anime.

725
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:29,120
You're really a muggle in the world of anime.

726
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:32,520
Go.

727
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,920
There's a M4.

728
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,240
What are you gaping at?

729
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,040
Yukito.

730
00:40:45,400 --> 00:40:47,160
Ah, quite alike.

731
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,360
Would you like to

732
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,600
get to know him?

733
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:53,880
He doesn't know me.

734
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:58,280
Han-style dress and Yukito are from two different systems.

735
00:40:58,280 --> 00:40:59,880
We shouldn't appear at the same time.

736
00:40:59,880 --> 00:41:01,360
It doesn't matter at all.

737
00:41:01,360 --> 00:41:02,680
The romance in your mind,

738
00:41:02,680 --> 00:41:04,240
even if it happens 100 times,

739
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,800
is impossible to come true.

740
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,240
Chance for happiness in reality is always fleeting.

741
00:41:10,040 --> 00:41:11,360
However,

742
00:41:11,360 --> 00:41:12,680
if you take one more step,

743
00:41:12,680 --> 00:41:15,480
you're likely to have a happy relationship.

744
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:18,120
You're right.

745
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:21,120
Yukito.
