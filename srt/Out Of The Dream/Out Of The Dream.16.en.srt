it's more than a project,

Maybe I'm a little selfish,

111
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:13,360
but I really don't want them

112

to be sealed in boxes,

113

and piled in the corner.

114
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:19,400

whoever is in charge of Dragon Scale,

119
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:28,360

317
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:44,280
it's improper to

threaten others with their privacy?

319
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,560
Wait.

320
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:52,880
Please get the surveillance video
of the day before yesterday for me.

321

323

OK.

Yes.

can you earn in a year?

333
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:34,400
About 420,000 or 430,000 yuan.

334
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:38,080
Tell you what. This place was his home.

335
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:40,400
His family of five all lived here.

336
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:42,360
His bed

337
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:43,920
was around here.

338
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:48,440
Then I bought the place.

339
00:17:48,800 --> 00:17:51,000
But I couldn't pull it down

340
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,880
just because of him.

341
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:55,440
He was the toughest habitant here.

342
00:17:55,880 --> 00:17:57,880
But later I used some methods

343
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,760
to pull down his house.

344
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,920
Then

345

I even helped him open the noodle shop.

00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:40,840
is to commit I'm wrong

517
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,640
and to accept that you don't forgive me.

518
00:26:43,520 --> 00:26:44,680
Rather than,

519
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,520
"What else do you want

520
00:26:46,520 --> 00:26:48,400
since I've apologized?"

521
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:50,880
So it's better for you

522
00:26:51,200 --> 00:26:53,560
to say sorry to her in person.

523
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:02,400
This time, thank you so much.

524
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,080
And I'm sorry.

525
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:08,240
Don't thank me.

526
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:09,960
Thank yourself.

527
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:16,720
I begin to dislike you within ten minutes.

528
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,480
Why are you always

529
00:27:17,480 --> 00:27:19,800
so self-righteous?

530
00:27:19,800 --> 00:27:22,000
It's you who take advantages,

531
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:23,440
but you always act like

532
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:25,840
you're considering others' pride.

533
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:29,240
Like now.

534
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:38,200
Unlike me.

535
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:41,440
I've been a loser since the college time.

536
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,960
I wasn't good at talking.

537
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:45,480
Do you know why

538
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,240
I didn't go with you after school

539
00:27:47,240 --> 00:27:49,800
but waiting for you in Internet cafes?

540
00:27:49,800 --> 00:27:51,920
Because as long as we left together,

541
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,400
they would say

542
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:54,800
only Bai Feili

543
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,600
liked to play with him

544
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,080
and showed mercy on him.

545
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,400
I also know

546
00:28:02,040 --> 00:28:03,520
they would say

547
00:28:04,240 --> 00:28:05,360
Bai Feili liked to

548
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:07,920
play with these weirdos.

549
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:10,480
Don't consider yourself

550
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:12,080
as a know-it-all.

551
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,360
You've no idea what people like us

552
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:16,360
have gone through.

553
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:18,720
I didn't dare to look in a mirror.

554
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:20,400
I didn't dare to buy clothes.

555
00:28:21,320 --> 00:28:22,480
When I got on a bus,

556
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:24,000
I had to choose the last row.

557
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,800
Even in the toilet,

558
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:26,480
I would wait to be the last one to enter.

559
00:28:29,160 --> 00:28:31,280
You're already so popular.

560
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,720
You should stay away from us.

561
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,280
Then I found there was a field

562
00:28:37,280 --> 00:28:38,560
where I could fulfill my potential,

563
00:28:38,560 --> 00:28:40,160
and make everyone

564
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,800
respect me.

565
00:28:43,880 --> 00:28:45,320
I remembered

566
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:48,800
when your first product came out.

567
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:52,400
No one expected

568
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:54,480
the most popular role was not the hero,

569
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:56,480
or the No, 2 role,

570
00:28:57,680 --> 00:28:58,680
but you,

571
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:01,000
No. 13.

572
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,840
The whole forum got excited.

573
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,920
Everyone said

574
00:29:06,320 --> 00:29:08,480
you were the role.

575
00:29:08,920 --> 00:29:10,880
They pressed you to produce sequels.

576
00:29:11,320 --> 00:29:12,640
The number of the replies

577
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,680
even broke the record.

578
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:18,680
That's why I

579
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:21,600
founded Feiwo.

580
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,440
The reason you founded Feiwo

581
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:26,800
is to play

582
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,400
the roles you like,

583
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,320
and to

584
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,200
help different people

585
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:35,440
find the suitable roles for them to cosplay.

586
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,560
I remembered you once told me

587
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,400
on the COS stage,

588
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:43,240
there's no distinction

589
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,560
between leading and supporting roles.

590
00:29:46,000 --> 00:29:48,440
No matter how unimportant the role is,

591
00:29:48,600 --> 00:29:50,360
as long as people like it,

592
00:29:51,040 --> 00:29:53,120
even there's only one audience,

593
00:29:55,600 --> 00:29:57,600
we have to buck up

594
00:29:57,840 --> 00:30:00,160
and can't fail his or her expectation.

595
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,760
Because of this,

596
00:30:04,440 --> 00:30:06,120
you've developed Feiwo

597
00:30:06,120 --> 00:30:07,640
to be a famous studio.

598
00:30:08,520 --> 00:30:09,920
But I didn't expect

599
00:30:09,920 --> 00:30:11,640
the road to be harder and harder.

600
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:13,920
It's not enough

601
00:30:13,920 --> 00:30:15,160
to have a dream only.

602
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,480
Sometimes I need something I dislike

603
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,920
to support me

604
00:30:20,920 --> 00:30:22,360
and Feiwo

605
00:30:22,800 --> 00:30:24,280
to go so far.

606
00:30:25,320 --> 00:30:27,520
Thanks to those things

607
00:30:28,480 --> 00:30:30,240
I'm relieved

608
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,840
that it's you who got Dragon Scale from us.

609
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:36,120
No one has a clearer goal than you do.

610
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:38,480
No one

611
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:40,840
likes Dragon Scale more than you.

612
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:42,600
I thought,

613
00:30:43,440 --> 00:30:44,960
Li Hentian

614
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:48,040
would keep doing it until it's successful

615
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,120
no matter what difficulties he would meet,

616
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:50,800
what ways he would use.

617
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:53,160
There's nothing wrong with the aspiration

618
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,560
to reach the destination and to win.

619
00:30:57,880 --> 00:30:59,880
But never forget

620
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:02,560
why

621
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,400
we start our journey.

622
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:21,000
Bai Feili,

623
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,680
you have to move forward

624
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:24,720
in the industry.

625
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:27,400
You have to become strong and firm.

626
00:31:28,360 --> 00:31:30,680
Then I'll find ways to defeat you.

627
00:31:32,320 --> 00:31:33,880
You can defeat me

628
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,720
in terms of strength.

629
00:31:56,800 --> 00:31:58,360
Cang,

630
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,800
tell me

631
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:06,640
should I help Feiwo?

632
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,960
How about this?

633
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:12,640
If you stretch your right hand,

634
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:13,880
I'll help.

635
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,040
If you stretch the left hand,

636
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:16,360
I won't.

637
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:17,280
Deal?

638
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,600
You're eating all the time.

639
00:32:33,880 --> 00:32:35,480
Are you waiting for me?

640
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:38,680
Why not go to sleep? It's late.

641
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,040
Are you hungry?

642
00:32:52,240 --> 00:32:55,560
You've specially prepared food for me?

643
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,200
They're for Cang.

644
00:32:57,360 --> 00:32:58,480
It didn't eat.

645
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:03,600
So enjoy it. Don't waste food.

646
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:10,760
So,

647
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:14,360
how is it going with your help to Feiwo?

648
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,440
Is everything going well?

649
00:33:16,080 --> 00:33:19,280
I've discussed with Li Hentian.

650
00:33:19,840 --> 00:33:20,160
Perhaps...

651
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,360
Stop.

652
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:26,800
I won't interfere with your decision,

653
00:33:27,840 --> 00:33:29,760
but don't tell me

654
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,320
these details.

655
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,360
You drank?

656
00:33:45,120 --> 00:33:46,520
It seems

657
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:48,360
you're enjoying

658
00:33:48,800 --> 00:33:50,480
to work with them.

659
00:33:57,400 --> 00:33:58,920
Porridge's in the pot.

660
00:33:59,080 --> 00:34:00,760
I'm going to bed.

661
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,440
Why can't you understand me?

662
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:14,199
Do you enjoy

663
00:34:14,199 --> 00:34:16,440
saving others?

664
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:19,920
What about me?

665
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:24,360
Is it also because

666
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:26,080
you enjoy the feeling of

667
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:28,080
saving me?

668
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:32,520
I never thought

669
00:34:32,520 --> 00:34:34,080
to save you.

670
00:34:35,080 --> 00:34:37,239
It's you who's been saving me.

671
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:39,760
You help me know

672
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:41,239
who I am.

673
00:34:41,239 --> 00:34:43,000
Then I've kept praying

674
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:46,120
you will like the real me.

675
00:34:47,679 --> 00:34:49,560
I also want to accept,

676
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:53,440
but I can't make it now.

677
00:34:55,520 --> 00:34:57,840
This is also the real me.

678
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:34,840
No matter how intimate you are,

679
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:36,360
you're two different people.

680
00:35:36,360 --> 00:35:38,560
You can't totally agree with each other on everything.

681
00:35:38,560 --> 00:35:39,720
So just stand in the middle

682
00:35:39,720 --> 00:35:40,920
when you have disputes,

683
00:35:40,920 --> 00:35:43,360
and try to accept and understand.

684
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:26,940
[Dragon Scale]

685
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,120
Excuse me,

686
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,640
do you wanna buy it?

687
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:50,760
Yu Fei?

688
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:54,880
Well,

689
00:36:54,880 --> 00:36:57,120
Hao Shi's mum called him,

690
00:36:57,120 --> 00:37:00,280
but he didn't answer the phone. So I came to find him.

691
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:01,760
Will you come inside to tell him?

692
00:37:01,760 --> 00:37:03,160
Or do you want me to pass your message on to him?

693
00:37:06,520 --> 00:37:09,120
Hao Shi didn't come to help Li Hentian voluntarily,

694
00:37:09,120 --> 00:37:10,560
so he didn't betray you.

695
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:15,200
I didn't mean Bai Feili betrayed you.

696
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:18,760
The reason he helped Feiwo is, is...

697
00:37:21,920 --> 00:37:22,880
Yu Fei,

698
00:37:23,080 --> 00:37:24,800
can we talk now?

699
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:26,920
Thank you.

700
00:37:31,440 --> 00:37:32,520
Yu Fei,

701
00:37:32,520 --> 00:37:33,680
I'm sorry.

702
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:38,920
The day when we were in the studio,

703
00:37:38,920 --> 00:37:39,760
he seemed to see

704
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,720
something terrible,

705
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:44,200
so I loosened his buttons

706
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:45,760
to ask him to breathe free.

707
00:37:46,680 --> 00:37:47,520
I'm sorry

708
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:49,160
for making you misunderstand.

709
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,200
I should have explained it earlier.

710
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:52,360
That's fine.

711
00:38:03,280 --> 00:38:05,960
Do you like Bai Feili?

712
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:12,800
I…

713
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,960
I'm sorry.

714
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,160
It's OK.

715
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:19,920
I wasn't the person

716
00:38:19,920 --> 00:38:21,880
you're seeing now.

717
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,160
Thanks to him,

718
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,920
I became the person I am now.

719
00:38:29,960 --> 00:38:31,720
It's me who violated the school rules.

720
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,200
Anyway, I don't need the interview qualification.

721
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,560
But you helped me,

722
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:45,160
they will isolate you.

723
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:46,480
It doesn't matter.

724
00:38:46,480 --> 00:38:48,600
Since we are two people, so it can't be called isolation.

725
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:52,000
Sister, are you interested in joining our club?

726
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,080
For those

727
00:38:55,080 --> 00:38:56,960
who are waiting to see your jokes,

728
00:38:57,320 --> 00:38:59,080
the best counterattack

729
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,560
is to laugh loudly

730
00:39:00,940 --> 00:39:03,060
[Please, be brave and have a try.]

731
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,120
in the spotlight.

732
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,240
It's them

733
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:06,640
who should hide in the corner and cry.

734
00:39:09,320 --> 00:39:11,400
Guan Zhijiu, stand by

735
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,280
And later,

736
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:17,080
we founded Jiubai.

737
00:39:17,080 --> 00:39:18,360
We're dreaming of

738
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:20,840
founding our own theater.

739
00:39:21,840 --> 00:39:23,560
The person

740
00:39:23,560 --> 00:39:25,360
shows up in the most critical moment

741
00:39:26,080 --> 00:39:28,960
will be special, right?

742
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:33,320
But,

743
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:36,320
I still want to know

744
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:39,320
what Bai Feili met

745
00:39:39,320 --> 00:39:40,840
on the day of his battle.

746
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:44,720
Perhaps Bai Feili

747
00:39:44,720 --> 00:39:46,920
has his own secret.

748
00:39:59,520 --> 00:40:00,280
By the way,

749
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:03,080
I figured out how to deal with

750
00:40:03,080 --> 00:40:03,960
the Peking Opera monologue in the beginning.

751
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:05,240
Did you?

752
00:40:05,240 --> 00:40:07,200
Although it's not the best,

753
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,960
-but... -Wuchang,

754
00:40:08,960 --> 00:40:10,440
help me change the rhythm of guiding pattern.

755
00:40:10,440 --> 00:40:11,800
I sent it to you just now.

756
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,440
OK.

757
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:15,760
Why is she here?

758
00:40:33,480 --> 00:40:34,560
It's fine.

759
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:35,800
Don't push yourself.

760
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:38,480
We've known each other for a long time,

761
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:40,080
so you should know my personality.

762
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,600
If I feel pushed,

763
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,960
I won't come.

764
00:40:47,640 --> 00:40:49,400
Don't say "thank you".

765
00:40:50,200 --> 00:40:52,320
It turns out someone's bad habits

766
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,920
are infectious.

767
00:41:02,520 --> 00:41:04,080
Yu Fei…

768
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:07,720
I'm sorry, I...

769
00:41:07,720 --> 00:41:09,240
I didn't come to help you.

770
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,400
After all,

771
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,640
Scalebound is many people's dream in their youth,

772
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:18,160
including this man.

773
00:41:26,790 --> 00:41:39,660
♫ Intrude the mysterious realm, and explore the secret abyss. ♫

774
00:41:44,510 --> 00:42:07,050
♫ The origin of Dragon Scale. ♫
