Does the adhesive tape really work?

5
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:49,240
When I was a kid, my mom and I used to pitch a tent at the house

6
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:52,320
in the stormy days.

7
00:01:53,080 --> 00:01:54,960
I also looked it up on the Internet.

8
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:56,200
After all,

9
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,840
I didn't know the house can leak

10
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,360
until I met you.

11
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,720
I didn't know

12
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,360
what the prototype of the Princess and the Pea looked like

13
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:05,640
before I met you.

14
00:02:06,280 --> 00:02:07,560
Why is the Princess and the Pea?

15
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:16,920
What are you laughing at?

16
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:21,040
Sometimes I really think

17
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,320
you're such a reckless girl,

18
00:02:23,960 --> 00:02:26,560
a single-celled creature living by instinct,

19
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:28,280
like a paramecium.

20
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:30,160
You are the p...

21
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:31,600
What?

22
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:34,079
Did't you say you wanted to know everything about me?

23
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:36,600
You can't stand it just knowing that?

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:39,120
Do you

25
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,200
any spark of humanity?

26
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:47,120
Does it count?

27
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,400
Falling in love with a paramecium is not a spark of humanity.

28
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:57,600
It's my turn now.

29
00:02:58,360 --> 00:02:59,560
What?

30
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:01,680
It's my turn to get to know you.

31
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:03,040
OK.

32
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,720

The person who walks in front asks the question.

36
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:10,840
OK?

She was my senior in high school.

40
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:26,320
Because we have the same interests and hobbies,

42

If Dao Ge knows I am so lucky,

It seems that you came here with Dao Ge a lot.

Yes.

No one has a time machine.

Fair enough, isn't it?

84
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:24,480
There's a ten-year gap between high school and elementary school, OK?

85

That's why I got to know you before he did.

Happy birthday to the 6-year-old Yu Fei.

But I never had a birthday.

After all,

95
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,400
my birth

96
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:53,640
was not worth celebrating.

97
00:05:57,600 --> 00:05:59,120
But for me,

98
00:05:59,240 --> 00:06:01,200
it's the most celebratory thing.

99
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:03,440
Just think of it as spending time with me.

100
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,680
Make a wish.

101
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:07,880
There's no cake and no candles.

102
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:09,040
How do I make a wish?

103
00:06:14,200 --> 00:06:15,560
I'm much more reliable

104
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:18,120
than a candle.

105
00:06:33,080 --> 00:06:34,360
The first wish.

106
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,560
I wish my mom could actually

107
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,400
come and pick up

108
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,120
six-year-old Yu Fei before she finished her mung bean soup.

109
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:43,400
Because she was sitting here alone

110
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,080
and she couldn't afford a second bowl.

111
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:47,840
And she had to make up the word

112
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:50,640
to brag about Uncle De for eating and drinking.

113
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,159
It was really hard.

114
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:56,560
The second wish.

115
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,200
I hope 12-year-old Yu Fei remembered that

116
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:02,360
mom was not gonna pick her up

117
00:07:02,600 --> 00:07:04,400
at the gate of the Shandengting Troupe.

118
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:06,840
But don't be afraid.

119
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:08,640
Because singing

120
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:09,880
would be

121
00:07:09,880 --> 00:07:13,040
very, very important to her.

122
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,080
The third wish.

123
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,320
Don't be afraid.

124
00:07:21,480 --> 00:07:22,840
Don't run away.

To the age of twenty-two,

126
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:27,840
you'll meet Bai...

127
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:34,400
Keep the third wish a secret.

128
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,200
It'll come true when you grow up.

129

He'll be waiting for you.

130
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,120
He'll take you home.

131
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:09,680
There're thousands of netizens,

132
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:11,480
but few are reliable.

133
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,320
I told you the waterproof tape wasn't working.

134
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:17,040
The weather is really bad.

135
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:19,880
Maybe we should just find a hotel.

136
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:21,880
No.

137
00:08:22,600 --> 00:08:24,200
I get a whole room full of stuff here.

138
00:08:24,520 --> 00:08:26,320
If it suddenly rains heavily in the evening,

139
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:27,880
it'll soak it all.

140
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:29,960
Then what are we supposed to do?

141
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:32,720
Or

142
00:08:33,080 --> 00:08:34,520
let's do it in an old-fashioned way.

143

Pitch a tent.

144
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,320
Are we really gonna set up a tent?

145
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,600
You help me take out the sheets.

146
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,200
I'll do the rest.

147
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:52,760
Where are the sheets?

148
00:08:52,880 --> 00:08:54,120
It's in the closet.

149
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:26,320
Did you find it?

150
00:09:29,560 --> 00:09:30,720

151
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:34,720
I didn't find the sheet.

152
00:09:39,080 --> 00:09:40,560
It's my fault.

153
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:43,880
How can you find my sheet?

154
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:48,160
Are you OK?

155
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:50,720
I'm fine.

156
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,280
Do you want to go out?

[Please be brave and have a try]

158
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:35,360
I didn't get it.

159
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:37,760
And the old lady in our school canteen,

160
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:39,080
her hands are shaky when she serves the food.

161

When it's your turn,

there's almost nothing left.

Is she...?

164
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,080
Right?

165
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:51,560
Wait a moment.

166

Get out of the way!

What are you so proud of?

168
00:10:57,000 --> 00:10:59,200
Isn't it just an independent recruitment?

169
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:01,000
What's wrong with copying a paper?

170
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:03,680
I can't believe you tattle on Weiwei,

171

172

How can you compare to her?

00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,760
Go ahead.

175
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:15,000
If you step on the lawn, you're against the school rules.

176
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,600
We'll film you

177
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:17,880
and tell the teacher.

178
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:20,000
Let's see whether the teacher is treating everyone fairly

179
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,520
and cancel your qualification.

180
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,600
Do something.

181
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:28,360
Bai Feili.

182
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,920
Why does he help Guan Zhijiu?

183
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:30,920
Who knows.

184
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:32,080
He's in the student union.

185
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,240
Let's just leave them alone.

186
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:34,840
I'm the one who broke the rules.

187
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:37,000
I don't need an interview qualification anyway.

188
00:11:38,520 --> 00:11:39,320
Go, go, go. Let's go.

189
00:11:45,640 --> 00:11:46,520
You helped me.

190
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:48,280
They will isolate you, too.

191
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:49,440
It doesn't matter.

192
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:51,320
Two people together will not be isolated.

193
00:11:51,520 --> 00:11:52,280
Senior,

194
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:54,560
are you interested in joining our club?

195
00:11:58,320 --> 00:11:59,760
I will take that as a yes.

196
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:00,920
After school,

197
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,680
see you in the music room on the third floor.

198
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:03,800
We'll wait for you.

199
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Time for class.

200
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,360
Aren't you going?

201
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,720
Go to the bathroom quickly.

202
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,000
You're going on stage in five minutes.

203
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:39,840
But,

204
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,080
the bathroom is over there.

205
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
This is the escape route.

206
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:52,320
I used to be a thorn in everyone's side.

207
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:54,680
If I stand on the stage like this,

208
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,640
they're just gonna hate me more.

209
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:59,560
They'll think of more ways to humiliate me.

210
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,200
Sorry

211
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:06,240
to let you down.

212
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:13,400
Freak.

213
00:13:14,680 --> 00:13:16,320
In order to get yourself a good college,

214
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:18,800
you went to snitch. You're two-faced.

215
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,280
All right. Stop talking!

216
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:27,400
S...sorry.

217
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,080
Your character needs that.

218
00:13:31,640 --> 00:13:32,520
Hold it.

219
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:34,600
Bring it to the stage later.

220
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:36,520
The best response

221
00:13:36,520 --> 00:13:38,600
to those who are ready to see your jokes

222
00:13:38,760 --> 00:13:40,120
is

223
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:41,200
to laugh louder

224
00:13:41,760 --> 00:13:43,000
in the spotlight

225
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:44,280
later.

226
00:13:44,920 --> 00:13:46,440
They're the ones

227
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:47,440
who should be crying in the dark.

228
00:13:56,550 --> 00:13:59,060
[Please be brave and have a try]

229
00:14:19,200 --> 00:14:20,800
You're with me so many years,

230
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:22,040
thank you.

231
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,040
There's no room for you

232
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,720
in the fridge anymore.

233
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:33,960
[Please be brave and have a try]

234
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,280
Don't do that kind of work

235
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,720
in the future.

236
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,360
You look tired.

237
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,080
You caught me in the act.

238
00:14:53,800 --> 00:14:54,880
Actually,

239
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,160
I have something to tell you.

240
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,080
What?

241
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,160
I'm Ruoshui.

242
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,640
I know.

243
00:15:10,040 --> 00:15:12,160
I heard it during the battle.

244
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,080
There's one more thing.

245
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,280
In fact,

246
00:15:24,280 --> 00:15:25,560
I have a disease.

247
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:29,280
It makes me very scared of

248
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,840
something.

249
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:40,840
I...

250
00:15:50,400 --> 00:15:51,680
Is it a disease?

251
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:55,400
Even if superheroes must have something they're afraid of.

252
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,880
I have my fears, too.

253
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,640
I'm afraid of chilies.

254
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:02,800
I want to cry when I eat them.

255
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,160
I'm also afraid that

256
00:16:05,640 --> 00:16:07,440
my mom isn't gonna pick me up.

257
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:11,920
I'm also afraid I'd fall down again when practicing.

258
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:15,040
Now when I touch these scars,

259
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,240
I even dream about falling down

260
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,080
when I sleep at night.

261
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,240
Does it still hurt?

262
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,400
It stopped hurting a long time ago.

263
00:16:40,640 --> 00:16:43,640
All scars will heal.

264
00:16:50,080 --> 00:16:51,760
You do have a

265
00:16:52,080 --> 00:16:54,240
superpower

266
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:56,400
that makes everything a little easier.

267
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,320
You also have the superpower.

268
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:02,880
My superpower

269
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:06,359
helped me find you.

270
00:17:38,360 --> 00:17:39,680
Bai Feili.

271
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:41,480
Hello?

272
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,360
Bai Feili.

273
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:49,400
Where is he?

274
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,360
The breakfast is ready for you.

275
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:06,920
And the movers will arrive at 11 o'clock.

276
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,640
If you need anything today,

277
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,720
please call the emergency contact number.

278
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:12,880
Sign: your butler.

279
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:13,960
Xiao Bai.

280
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,320
Obviously you're a life idiot,

281
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:18,280
and you pretend to be a butler Xiao Bai.

282
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:38,320
Let me see your ID photo.

283
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:42,160
So handsome!

284
00:18:46,840 --> 00:18:48,720
August 22.

285
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,440
Is this today?

286
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,320
I didn't want to be so hasty.

287
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,520
Knowing you happened to be in Suzhou,

288
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:08,400
I pick you up to a dinner party.

289
00:19:08,800 --> 00:19:10,160
You help me look over the contract.

290
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,600
By the way,

291
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,520
let's celebrate.

292
00:19:19,040 --> 00:19:20,480
There's no need to celebrate.

293
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:22,680
I didn't expect

294
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,040
you would remember.

295
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:26,960
You did a good job this time.

296
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:30,600
I was gonna force you to back down

297
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:32,200
by doubling the valuation in a month.

298
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:35,200
I didn't expect an online live broadcast

299
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:37,040
to attract so many business discussions.

300
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,000
And you finished the bet a week ahead of the time.

301
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,600
It's worthy of celebration.

302
00:19:44,240 --> 00:19:44,880
Xiao Yang,

303
00:19:45,560 --> 00:19:49,400
this is the vodka Chris mentioned.

304
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:51,080
The Russians love it.

305
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:52,840
I want you to prepare some caviar

306
00:19:52,840 --> 00:19:53,880
for their drinks.

307
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:55,480
OK. I've told them.

308
00:19:55,480 --> 00:19:56,560
Don't worry, Mr. Bai.

309
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:00,600
Mr. Bai really cares about your partners.

310
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:03,280
Everything is arranged so thoughtfully.

311
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,160
There's no room for error in business.

312
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,720
It's the same to you.

313
00:20:09,600 --> 00:20:10,800
We made a deal

314
00:20:10,800 --> 00:20:11,960
and I won't break my word.

315
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:13,520
Not just that.

316
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,520
I want to increase my investment to 30 million,

317
00:20:15,800 --> 00:20:18,000
but I want 60% of the shares.

318
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:25,880
I know

319
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:27,200
there're others

320
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:28,600
who think highly of your potential

321
00:20:28,800 --> 00:20:30,360
and approach you about investment.

322
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:31,880
But not everyone

323
00:20:32,120 --> 00:20:34,680
has the capacity to share risk.

324
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:37,360
They just want to

325
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,800
make an easy buck of your project.

326
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,320
But I'm different.

327
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,800
I'm investing in your future.

328
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:47,040
Are you investing in my future

329
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,440
or buying out my future?

330
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:54,680
It's so nice to be young.

331
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,640
There're always so many principles.

332
00:20:57,960 --> 00:20:59,120
Don't worry.

333
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,160
I'll stay out of the operation.

334
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:05,240
I've written the details in the contract.

335
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:11,160
My terms are simple.

336
00:21:11,800 --> 00:21:13,720
You only own the dividend stocks,

337
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,400
not the decision stocks.

338
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:17,520
The company

339
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:19,200
is still my company.

340
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,160
Xiao Bai,

341
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,360
in business,

342
00:21:30,360 --> 00:21:31,760
you can't be so rampant.

343
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,840
If you want to get a great benefit,

344
00:21:34,840 --> 00:21:37,080
you'd better give up something.

345
00:21:39,280 --> 00:21:41,040
You taught me

346
00:21:41,040 --> 00:21:42,640
there's no one

347
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:44,320
to trust in business.

348
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,880
Some things

349
00:21:47,560 --> 00:21:49,760
are better in your own hands.

350
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:54,360
Mr. Bai,

351
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,280
after the battle,

352
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,680
Mr. Zhang took the lead

353
00:21:57,680 --> 00:22:01,160
and united several companies to make inquiries with Jiubai.

354
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,520
I did some research.

355
00:22:02,920 --> 00:22:04,520
Although the offer wasn't as high as ours,

356
00:22:04,520 --> 00:22:06,600
they completely gave up the decision-making power.

357
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:09,360
It's not Xiao Bai begging us anymore.

358
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:10,960
It's that we want to take advantage of him

359
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:12,320
to take the dividend.

360
00:22:12,680 --> 00:22:14,000
Have a look.

361
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:18,290
[Quotation and Investment Questionnaire]

362
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:43,000
Sorry.

363
00:22:43,000 --> 00:22:44,520
Sorry. Be careful.

364
00:22:45,640 --> 00:22:46,520
Never mind.

365
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,560
If you bought me a cake from this store,

366
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,120
I'll hold it like this on the bus.

367
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,440
Your mind of rivalry is really everywhere.

368
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:54,800
I‘ll buy it for you. I'll buy it for you.

369
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:55,760
Look,

370
00:22:55,760 --> 00:22:57,920
the peas on her cake are quite funny.

371
00:22:58,240 --> 00:22:59,080
R...right?

372
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:23,240
Bai Feili.

373
00:23:24,680 --> 00:23:26,320
I still have your wallet.

374
00:23:27,800 --> 00:23:28,920
Bai Feili!

375
00:23:49,320 --> 00:23:51,120
Is he here?

376
00:23:52,160 --> 00:23:54,320
Isn't his car parked at the door?

377
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,440
Hello.

378
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,640
May I help you?

379
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:01,680
I'm looking for Bai Feili.

380
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,040
You're Bai Feili's...

381
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,280
I'm Bai Feili's

382
00:24:04,920 --> 00:24:06,400
friend, Yu Fei.

383
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:08,280
Hello, Miss. Yu.

384
00:24:08,640 --> 00:24:09,440
This way, please.

385
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:10,320
Thanks.

386
00:24:25,480 --> 00:24:26,880
In...in China,

387
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:29,320
I think there are several kinds of spicy food.

388
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:30,440
One from Jiangxi

389
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:31,920
eats the spiciest.

390
00:24:31,920 --> 00:24:33,760
It's definitely hotter than Hunan.

391
00:24:36,280 --> 00:24:37,080
Miss. Yu.

392
00:24:37,280 --> 00:24:38,760
Xiao Bai is in there.

393
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,440
Thanks.

394
00:24:40,840 --> 00:24:42,280
Let me help you with the cake.

395
00:24:42,280 --> 00:24:43,440
Thank you.

396
00:24:43,680 --> 00:24:45,440
You can print anything in 3D now.

397
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:46,720
Uncle Fang,

398
00:24:47,040 --> 00:24:48,840
please get me some Perrier Jouet.

399
00:24:48,840 --> 00:24:49,600
OK.

400
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:53,760
Yu Fei.

401
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,320
Mr. Fang,

402
00:25:00,840 --> 00:25:01,680
we're eating here

403
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:03,240
just to get some peace and quiet.

404
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:05,960
We don't need performance items to add to the fun.

405
00:25:06,840 --> 00:25:08,480
Remember to lock the door,

406
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:10,320
otherwise anybody can come in.

407
00:25:10,680 --> 00:25:11,800
I see, Miss. Feng.

408
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,040
Unfortunately, we meet again.

409
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:18,160
Auntie Feng,

410
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:20,120
this is my girlfriend, Yu Fei.

411
00:25:21,240 --> 00:25:22,360
Do you know each other?

412
00:25:25,960 --> 00:25:27,560
I know her mother.

413
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
You go ahead. I'm leaving.

414
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,000
Since you know each other,

415
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,640
Yu Fei, feel free

416
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:35,720
to eat.

417
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:38,240
Anutie Feng is the host today.

418
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,040
I think,

419
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:41,960
Yu Fei might be better suited for Dao Pai Dong.

420
00:25:41,960 --> 00:25:43,440
If you leave too,

421
00:25:43,800 --> 00:25:45,320
I can totally understand.

422
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:46,160
Auntie Feng,

423
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:47,880
you're so...You're right.

424
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:50,920
You prepared such a wonderful dinner.

425
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,520
If I miss it,

426
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,680
I'll probably be pissed until next year.

427
00:25:55,880 --> 00:25:58,520
If you insist.

428
00:26:00,280 --> 00:26:01,080
Auntie Feng,

429
00:26:01,080 --> 00:26:02,240
if you'll excuse me.

430
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,200
Hey, what's up, Bro?

431
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:05,960
Hey, Leo.

432
00:26:05,960 --> 00:26:06,960
Good to see you. Good to see you.

433
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:07,840
How have you been?

434
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,160
This is my girlfriend, Yu Fei.

435
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:11,840
She's a Peking Opera actress.

436
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,200
It's nice to meet you.

437
00:26:13,800 --> 00:26:16,640
I'm Yu Fei. Nice to meet you, too.

438
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,240
Hello.

439
00:26:18,800 --> 00:26:19,680
Peter.

440
00:26:19,840 --> 00:26:20,480
Alex.

441
00:26:20,480 --> 00:26:21,400
Good to see you.

442
00:26:21,400 --> 00:26:21,840
Lucas.

443
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:22,720
Good to see you.

444
00:26:24,080 --> 00:26:25,200
Hello.

445
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,480
I'm Xiao Bai's father, Bai Juyuan.

446
00:26:29,280 --> 00:26:30,600
Hello, uncle.

447
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:32,440
I've heard of you for a long time.

448
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,000
Today I finally meet you.

449
00:26:34,800 --> 00:26:36,080
You heard of me?

450
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,200
I don't think he brought me up.

451
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,280
That's what we usually do,

452
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,640
regardless of ages.

453
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:46,400
Sorry, Peter.

454
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:47,240
I think we need to reconfirm the  details of the plan...

455
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:48,560
Why did you come?

456
00:26:48,560 --> 00:26:50,240
I came here to bring you something.

457
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,240
Since you're here,

458
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:52,480
let's have dinner

459
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:54,440
and talk about cooperation together. Then we'll leave together.

460
00:26:54,440 --> 00:26:55,560
OK.

461
00:26:56,160 --> 00:26:57,000
Xiao Bai,

462
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,680
I'm taking you

463
00:26:58,680 --> 00:26:59,800
to a very important client.

464
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,760
Wait here for me.

465
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:03,680
You guys talk.

466
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,160
Look after my girlfriend.

467
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,200
Sure.

468
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:09,840
So,

469
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:11,040
we didn't expect Leo

470
00:27:11,040 --> 00:27:13,040
to have such a lovely girlfriend.

471
00:27:13,600 --> 00:27:15,240
Yes. Yeah.

472
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,000
Leo mentioned you're a Peking Opera actress,

473
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:20,240
just like Mei Lanfang?

474
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:21,800
No, no, no.

475
00:27:21,800 --> 00:27:24,120
She's different with Mei Lanfang,

476
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,040
just a street performer.

477
00:27:27,480 --> 00:27:30,240
We'll get something to eat.

478
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,920
Nice meeting you.

479
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,600
Order something fancy to eat.

480
00:27:38,880 --> 00:27:40,080
I'm not hungry.

481
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,320
It's not about whether you're hungry or not.

482
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,120
You don't understand what we're talking about,

483
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:45,840
and you can't get a word in.

484
00:27:46,520 --> 00:27:47,920
So you‘ll have to

485
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,520
eat something to keep your mouth shut.

486
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:51,480
I'm afraid he'll be embarrassed.

487
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:55,000
By the way,

488
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:56,560
we've got a new batch of

489
00:27:56,560 --> 00:27:59,320
good Cheval Blanc.

490
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:00,920
Introduce it to you?

491
00:28:02,360 --> 00:28:03,640
No, Auntie Feng,

492
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:05,000
drink it yourself.

[Your Own Confession Night]

494
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,560
There's an old saying,

495
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,600
food will be turned into mush after you swallow it.

496
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:18,800
You are so greedy.

497
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:20,360
Can you eat inside?

498
00:28:21,200 --> 00:28:22,480
It's so dark.

499
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:23,600
I'm not going in.

500
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:26,120
You worked so hard

501
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:27,280
to save electricity by organizing this event.

502
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:30,120
But I haven't seen a person for a long time.

503
00:28:32,560 --> 00:28:35,000
You are unteachable.

504
00:28:35,280 --> 00:28:36,480
This activity

505
00:28:36,480 --> 00:28:38,000
is all about purity.

506
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:39,520
Saving a day on electricity is nothing.

507
00:28:39,680 --> 00:28:40,680
But only

508
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,440
in this absolute darkness

509
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,120
can one open his heart

510
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:46,080
and speak their true mind.

511
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:47,360
Do you know?

512
00:28:51,040 --> 00:28:52,200
Good point.

Dao Ge.

514
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,160
Look. Xiao Zhu. Sit down.

515
00:28:56,160 --> 00:28:58,200
The guests are coming, aren't they?

516
00:28:58,200 --> 00:28:59,400
My bro, Xiao Zhu.

517
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,240
Hello.

00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:03,560
Look.

519
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:04,200
Right?

520
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:05,280
The guests are here.

521
00:29:08,240 --> 00:29:09,080
Dao Ge.

522
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:11,360
Do I have to attend the Confession Night, too?

523
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:14,560
It's about communicating and learning.

524
00:29:14,560 --> 00:29:15,640
Look at them,

525
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:17,720
they're so economical.

526
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:19,480
If it works well,

527
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:21,200
we'll do it in our store.

528
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:23,840
Well, Dao Ge,

529
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:26,440
You are two people...

530
00:29:26,680 --> 00:29:28,160
Don't worry.

531
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,360
We pay both of us.

532
00:29:31,160 --> 00:29:32,080
Uh...

533
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,760
Can the manager

534
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:35,240
agree to the blackout in the club?

535
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,440
How many times have I told you?

536
00:29:39,440 --> 00:29:41,000
I'm the manager now.

537
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:43,040
Remember.

538
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:46,080
Your brother, I, am not just a salesman.

539
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:48,000
Manager, do you know that?

540
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:48,960
M level.

541
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:50,280
Manager.

542
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,280
Dao Ge, is that manager?

543
00:29:53,680 --> 00:29:55,600
How could you not show respect to my guest?

544
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:58,240
My noddles is for one person.

545
00:29:58,680 --> 00:29:59,560
I'm telling you,

546
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,360
your Dao Ge is not good at English,

547
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:03,920
but I'll be successful.

548
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:05,800
Tell your sister about it, too.

549
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,960
Beef noodles with so much garlic are not very good.

550
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:17,560
You don't know how to cook like your sister.

551
00:30:17,880 --> 00:30:19,040
The problem between you and my sister

552
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,520
has nothing to do with me.

553
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:26,000
Why are Xiao Zhu's eyes

554
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,360
so strange?

555
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:28,760
Zhu, remember.

556
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:30,360
We should also pay attention to

557
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:32,000
the side dishes.

558
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:35,760
Dao Ge, you are

559
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,800
as foreign as Zhang Yituo.

560
00:30:38,360 --> 00:30:39,760
Well, Dao Ge,

561
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:40,600
it's getting late.

562
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,200
Our activity is about to begin.

563
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:44,880
Why don't you two go in and get ready?

564
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,200
OK. Let's go.

565
00:30:52,640 --> 00:30:53,600
Dao Ge is

566
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:55,360
still so careless.

567
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,320
No wonder my sister doesn't like him.

568
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:00,640
He just imitates.

569
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,320
No wonder he's always one step behind.

570
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:08,520
The entry fee is 50 yuan per person,

571
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:10,360
plus 20 yuan for milk tea.

572
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:13,200
I can make 70 yuan per person.

573
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:15,240
Two more people, I'll get 140 yuan.

574
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,720
Three people is 210 yuan.

575
00:31:17,720 --> 00:31:20,240
Then I'll save on my electricity bill this month.

576
00:31:21,160 --> 00:31:22,240
I'm Guanjiu.

577
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,360
I made a reservation.

578
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:26,240
Miss Guan.

579
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:28,400
I'm here waiting for you.

580
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,040
Welcome to A Night For A Lonely Love Confession.

581
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,280
Next, our guide

582
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,760
his boss

583
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,640
will take you in.

584
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:39,400
This way, please.

585
00:31:59,680 --> 00:32:03,080
We're really concerned that,

586
00:32:03,080 --> 00:32:04,360
this 10%

587
00:32:04,360 --> 00:32:06,560
is less than we expected.

588
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,680
I totally understand your concerns.

589
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,680
But

590
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,080
actually I don't think

591
00:32:11,080 --> 00:32:12,960
it's a good idea to cross it off.

592
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:16,200
Because it's not our best benefits.

593
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,200
If you cooperate with us,

594
00:32:19,000 --> 00:32:20,280
Wait a minute.

595
00:32:21,080 --> 00:32:21,800
Sorry.

596
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:24,040
I have an important call to answer.

597
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:25,400
Xiao Bai.

598
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,840
You get this contract done today.

599
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,640
Go ahead.

600
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:33,280
Shall we continue?

601
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:37,040
I'm sorry, where do we up?

602
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,120
Welcome to the Daydream Space.

603
00:32:43,120 --> 00:32:44,600
While the music starts,

604
00:32:44,600 --> 00:32:46,480
our activity begins.

605
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
This way.

606
00:32:49,160 --> 00:32:50,800
Hold your lantern.

607
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:52,880
Thank you.

608
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:17,160
Where have you been?

609
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:19,040
I have something to do.

610
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:20,120
I tell you,

611
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:21,480
today is your last day.

612
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:23,000
You can't neglect your duty.

613
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,400
Be quick. Play the music.

614
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:29,920
Alright.

615
00:33:29,920 --> 00:33:31,080
Be quick.

616
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,120
Sometimes,

617
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,760
habit is a strange thing.

618
00:33:41,240 --> 00:33:43,680
You think you get used to it, and other people get used to it, too.

619
00:33:44,680 --> 00:33:46,120
However, some habits

620
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,520
are just because you don't meet someone more suitable.

621
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:53,000
There's no order of arrival in the relationship.

622
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:53,960
Some people

623
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,520
even cut in.

624
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,600
Brother, don't be upset.

625
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:01,480
Yes.

626
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:03,440
Love has no order.

627
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:09,880
Love always makes people cry,

628
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:13,199
and make people feel not satisfied.

629
00:34:13,719 --> 00:34:15,960
Isn't this my own confession night?

630
00:34:19,679 --> 00:34:20,960
There's an old saying,

631
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,719
a person's loneliness,

632
00:34:22,719 --> 00:34:24,480
a group's carnival.

633
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,239
Sometimes,

634
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:26,960
we can hear

635
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:28,639
all the voices of the world.

636
00:34:28,639 --> 00:34:29,639
But,

637
00:34:29,639 --> 00:34:31,679
we can't be seen.

638
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:32,920
It's like

639
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:36,080
confession needs to be heard.

640
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:40,679
Brother, nonsense.

641
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:49,880
Why can't I have a name

642
00:34:49,880 --> 00:34:51,679
when it's a movie of three people?

643
00:34:52,360 --> 00:34:54,600
Experience must be bought.

644
00:34:54,600 --> 00:34:57,800
There're something you can't give in.

645
00:34:58,640 --> 00:34:59,960
But if you don't give in, it's useless.

646
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:02,720
The main character is not you.

647
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,080
You might as well pretend to be generous

648
00:35:04,080 --> 00:35:05,600
to make it look good.

649
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:08,720
Some things,

650
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,560
as you as you're willing to work hard,

651
00:35:10,920 --> 00:35:13,560
most are still able to succeed.

652
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:16,120
Who is it now?

653
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,240
But love is like winning the lottery,

654
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:21,680
not the most of the time.

655
00:35:24,040 --> 00:35:25,880
If love is a lottery ticket,

656
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,440
why do I insist on buying it for ten years,

657
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:29,200
but he just passed by the door

658
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:31,400
and easily win away my most wanted prize?

659
00:35:34,080 --> 00:35:35,880
Because you're the friend.

660
00:35:37,240 --> 00:35:39,360
I'm not gonna be friends anymore.

661
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,480
I

662
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:42,560
am

663
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:43,480
gonna

664
00:35:43,640 --> 00:35:44,360
confess.

665
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:45,720
It's of no use.

666
00:35:47,200 --> 00:35:49,600
A secret crush is like expired snacks.

667
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:52,240
If you miss the best time to taste it,

668
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:53,680
whenever you open it,

669
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,000
it'll be inappropriate.

670
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:57,880
If you don't open it,

671
00:35:57,880 --> 00:35:59,680
you'll never know whether you two fit together.

672
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,080
The you should try it.

673
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:02,920
Let's see when you speak it,

674
00:36:03,160 --> 00:36:04,640
you can't be friends

675
00:36:04,960 --> 00:36:07,400
or she becomes your girlfriend.

676
00:36:13,800 --> 00:36:16,160
They're not contradictory.

677
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:19,040
After I confess to her,

678
00:36:19,600 --> 00:36:20,760
she becomes my girlfriend

679
00:36:21,440 --> 00:36:23,200
instead of a friend.

680
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,960
Isn't that good?

681
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:28,880
Where is my applause?

682
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:34,800
There's another possibility,

683
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,160
called,

684
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,640
not only you didn't get it,

685
00:36:37,640 --> 00:36:39,160
but you lost it.

686
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:44,240
In fact, we all know that, don't we?

687
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:47,120
If we could be successful,

688
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:48,760
we have done it.

689
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,640
What does

690
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,880
this mean?

691
00:37:07,080 --> 00:37:09,960
This is the portal to the parallel universe.

692
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:11,680
There,

693
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:15,080
you're already the only one for someone.

694
00:37:21,320 --> 00:37:24,400
You don't have to buy a ticket with this.

695
00:37:26,040 --> 00:37:27,160
What a pity.

696
00:37:27,520 --> 00:37:28,920
There‘s no dimension door

697
00:37:28,920 --> 00:37:30,640
in the real world.

698
00:37:31,200 --> 00:37:33,080
At the end of the night,

699
00:37:33,480 --> 00:37:36,000
I'm still going to face him everyday.

700
00:37:36,520 --> 00:37:37,880
Continue...

701
00:37:38,160 --> 00:37:40,040
I can't dislike him

702
00:37:40,440 --> 00:37:42,600
and pretend that nothing happened.

703
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,120
Then who

704
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,000
is he?

705
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:47,560
He...

706
00:37:49,520 --> 00:37:51,480
is my true guide.

707
00:37:52,360 --> 00:37:54,040
He took me to another dimension

708
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:56,120
so that I can meet everything I like,

709
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:03,560
including him.

710
00:38:07,720 --> 00:38:08,840
But thank you.

711
00:38:10,080 --> 00:38:12,280
A lot of words have been kept in my heart for too long.

712
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,320
It feels so much better to speak them out.

713
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:24,800
Miss Yu,

714
00:38:25,240 --> 00:38:27,480
the chicken soup is ready.

715
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,120
Xiao Bai is busy.

716
00:38:30,120 --> 00:38:31,400
You may have some soup first.

717
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:32,640
OK. Thank you.

718
00:38:32,920 --> 00:38:33,800
Please.

719
00:38:36,080 --> 00:38:37,440
Cheers. Cheers.

720
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:45,480
Mr. Fang,

721
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,560
could you get a Chinese menu

722
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:49,640
for Miss Yu?

723
00:38:50,040 --> 00:38:51,280
OK. Wait a moment.

724
00:38:58,240 --> 00:38:59,880
Alex, cheers.

725
00:39:01,320 --> 00:39:02,280
Cheers.

726
00:39:09,400 --> 00:39:11,200
Do you want more vodka?

727
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:12,560
Sure.

728
00:39:12,680 --> 00:39:13,800
Would you like some?

729
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:16,560
No, I like vodka,

730
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:20,880
but I have to help my boyfriend drive tonight.

731
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:22,800
Leo is a lucky guy.

732
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,320
You're an amazing girlfriend.

733
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,520
Thank you.

734
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:27,920
So you like butter?

735
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:28,760
I do.

736
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,880
I can't live without butter.

737
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,720
Then you must try Suzhou butter.

738
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:36,320
It's called

739
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,520
Tu Huangyou.

740
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:38,680
Tu Huangyou?

741
00:39:38,680 --> 00:39:42,400
Yeah. Made from crab roe.

742
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,880
That sounds delicious.

743
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:45,880
Yes. I really want to try it.

744
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:48,080
Miss Feng, here's your recipe.

745
00:39:52,920 --> 00:39:54,160
Today,

746
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,480
Mr. Bai has prepared hairy crabs for everyone.

747
00:40:07,840 --> 00:40:09,520
These are the crabs in season.

748
00:40:10,080 --> 00:40:12,080
If you don't know how to open a crab,

749
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:14,040
we can offer help.

750
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,720
Speaking of opening a crab,

751
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:18,720
Miss Yu said,

752
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:23,040
she would like to perform it for everyone.

753
00:40:23,040 --> 00:40:28,200
She has the experience to take apart the crabs very well.

754
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,080
Miss Yu,

755
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,760
start your show.

756
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,520
Mr. Fang.

757
00:40:45,720 --> 00:40:46,840
get me a set of tools.

758
00:40:58,040 --> 00:40:59,080
Throughout history,

759
00:40:59,280 --> 00:41:00,600
in Suzhou,

760
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:01,880
there're silk,

761
00:41:02,480 --> 00:41:03,600
fresh fruit

762
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,040
and beautiful women.

763
00:41:05,320 --> 00:41:07,400
In ancient times, we have Chen Yuanyuan and Liu Rushi.

764
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,600
Her mother is one, too.

765
00:41:11,960 --> 00:41:13,240
Auntie Feng,

766
00:41:13,880 --> 00:41:15,920
even if you are an elder,

767
00:41:16,200 --> 00:41:18,200
my patience towards you is limited.

768
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:20,400
Xiao Bai.

769
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,680
Your father and I knew each other for years.

770
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:25,240
I watched you grow up.

771
00:41:25,640 --> 00:41:26,960
I did it for your own good.

772
00:41:26,960 --> 00:41:28,360
Some girls

773
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,120
were raised up by

774
00:41:29,120 --> 00:41:31,360
their mother's shady business.

775
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,640
When they grew up,

776
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:34,080
they become a tool

777
00:41:34,080 --> 00:41:35,720
to beg for pity.

778
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:40,960
Today

779
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:42,960
I help Auntie unpack the crab,

780
00:41:43,600 --> 00:41:45,480
which suddenly reminded me of my childhood.

781
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,480
When I was a kid, at this time of the year,

782
00:41:48,680 --> 00:41:49,920
when I came home from school,

783
00:41:50,520 --> 00:41:52,120
I help my mom dismantle the crabs.

784
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:54,600
There are fifty days in autumn.

785
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:57,120
I have to tear apart 200 crabs a day

786
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,600
to pay for the fees of half a semester.

787
00:42:00,560 --> 00:42:01,960
But my mom said,

788
00:42:02,600 --> 00:42:05,680
those who sit in restaurants eating hairy crabs

789
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,280
are no more noble than others.

790
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,520
Because everyone

791
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:11,320
at the top of the food chain

792
00:42:12,080 --> 00:42:13,280
has the same smug face

793
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:15,120
when they

794
00:42:15,120 --> 00:42:16,320
face delicious food.

795
00:42:17,360 --> 00:42:19,520
My mom worked very hard to raise me up.

796
00:42:20,440 --> 00:42:21,880
She let me sing

797
00:42:22,160 --> 00:42:24,840
because it's the only way

798
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:25,520
she could think of

799
00:42:25,520 --> 00:42:27,640
to get me out of the mire.

800
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:30,680
So I don't have to envy people

801
00:42:31,280 --> 00:42:33,920
who sit in the restaurants eating hairy crabs.

802
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:36,240
I really don't know

803
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:37,720
much about English.

804
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:39,320
I have already said

805
00:42:39,720 --> 00:42:41,120
everything I wanted to say.

806
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:43,800
Auntie Feng,

807
00:42:45,080 --> 00:42:46,960
since you mentioned my mom,

808
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:50,280
I also want to tell you.

809
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:53,600
From now on,

810
00:42:53,600 --> 00:42:55,280
I don't want to hear

811
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,400
anything about my mom from you,

812
00:42:58,080 --> 00:42:59,640
or I won't be respectful.

813
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,560
Sorry, guys.

814
00:43:06,720 --> 00:43:07,640
Excuse me for

815
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,000
bothering you today.

816
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:17,080
Xiao Bai,

817
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,840
do you know who's her mother?

818
00:43:22,280 --> 00:43:23,840
What if I know who she is?

819
00:43:24,640 --> 00:43:26,840
Have you forgotten how your mother died?

820
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,400
If Yu Fei's mother hadn't stepped in,

821
00:43:30,200 --> 00:43:31,080
your uncle Yu Qing and I

822
00:43:31,080 --> 00:43:32,880
wouldn't be what we are.

823
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:34,760
Your parents' marriage

824
00:43:34,760 --> 00:43:36,520
was ruined the same way.

825
00:43:36,840 --> 00:43:38,400
I think you have

826
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,040
as much of an aversion to people like that as I do.

827
00:43:41,240 --> 00:43:43,040
Like mother, like daughter.

828
00:43:43,040 --> 00:43:44,920
Some people pretend to be innocent.

829
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:47,480
Do you know

830
00:43:47,480 --> 00:43:49,680
how she got out of the Shandengting Troupe?

831
00:43:50,400 --> 00:43:52,200
Because she had an illicit affair

832
00:43:52,200 --> 00:43:53,520
with her uncle, Ni Lin.
