You can stew these things together to replenish energy

171
00:11:08,400 --> 00:11:10,360
in case you pass out from rehearsing.

172
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:12,120
By the way,

173
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,400
hot milk

174
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,560
is the best

175
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:16,320
at this season.

176
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:19,880
In fact, you can also drink hot chocolate.

177
00:11:23,520 --> 00:11:25,760
I still have more than one month to start school.

178
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:27,440
I have got the visa ready.

179
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,400
Don't worry.

180
00:11:28,400 --> 00:11:29,920
I also bought the ticket.

181
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,560
I will live up to your expectations.

182
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:33,880
I will come back early

183
00:11:33,880 --> 00:11:35,160
to catch up with your progress.

184
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:36,800
After all,

185
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:38,440
I want us...

186
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:43,320
What?

187
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:50,800
A common victory for the future.

188
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:02,960
No matter it's ten years,

189
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:04,400
twelve months,

190
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:06,280
or ten kilometers,

191
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,080
I can reach you

192
00:12:09,080 --> 00:12:10,840
with my long legs.

193
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:12,880
I will convince you that

194
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,040
I can persevere

195
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,280
at the age of twenty.

196
00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:22,960
Why did you hit me?

197
00:12:22,960 --> 00:12:24,080
Why did you

198
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:25,600
talk wildly in front of me?

199
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:29,000
Guanjiu.

200
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:30,360
Do I have to call you Guanjiu

201
00:12:30,360 --> 00:12:32,280
after we fall in love?

202
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,040
Who wants to fall in love with you?

203
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,280
You.

204
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:37,880
Tell me,

205
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:39,640
when can we be together?

206
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:42,040
Alright, stop asking.

207
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:43,600
When can we be together?

208
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,480
Tell me. Tell me.

209
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:01,000
Boss, something's wrong.

210
00:13:01,000 --> 00:13:02,800
Dream of the South has suffered a massive refund.

211
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:05,200
Netizens also dug up Yu Fei.

212
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:11,400
The subscriber you dialed is not be answered for the moment.

213
00:13:13,270 --> 00:13:14,460
[Drama Department]

214
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:27,160
[A minute on the stage takes ten-year practice.]

215
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:34,080
What are you doing here?

216
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:35,960
I'm worried about you.

217
00:13:42,840 --> 00:13:44,680
Why are you dressed like that?

218
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,840
I don't want to implicate you.

219
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,320
I finally have such a handsome boyfriend

220
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:57,080
but I can't brag about it.

221
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,920
Why didn't you answer the phone?

222
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:02,120
Didn't someone say

223
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:05,160
I had to focus when practicing?

224
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,840
Then that guy must have never been in a relationship.

225
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:13,520
Your boyfriend's phone call is not a distraction.

226
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:16,040
Not necessarily.

227
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:16,960
Maybe

228
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:19,560
some girls like guys like that.

229
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:21,680
Who would like a guy like that?

230
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:24,240
Who knows.

231
00:14:24,680 --> 00:14:26,360
But that kind of guy

232
00:14:26,640 --> 00:14:28,560
is cute, too.

233
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,440
For example,

234
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,960
he sneaked in

235
00:14:32,960 --> 00:14:35,360
to pick up his girlfriend from school at midnight.

236
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:40,640
Since you‘re here today,

237
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,200
why not

238
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,960
do something that I've always wanted to do?

239
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:45,120
What?

240
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:48,680
Walk home together after school.

241
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:57,800
Oh gosh! I can't go any further.

242
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,640
Didn't you say

243
00:14:59,640 --> 00:15:00,680
you were gonna walk home

244
00:15:00,680 --> 00:15:02,160
with the guy you like?

245
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:04,600
I was wrong.

246
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,320
Now I know that

247
00:15:06,320 --> 00:15:08,360
movies are all lies.

248
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:11,000
How about...

249
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:18,640
You're so unkind.

250
00:15:19,640 --> 00:15:22,200
We already have an understanding. Who needs to be polite?

251
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:29,440
You still care about

252
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,920
what the netizens said, right?

253
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Sorry.

254
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:39,640
I didn't realize

255
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:42,160
it was so hard on you.

256
00:15:44,200 --> 00:15:46,680
Once a man falls into his weakness,

257
00:15:46,680 --> 00:15:48,640
he will go on and on.

258
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:51,320
They just want to see you hit the ground,

259
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,680
below ground level.

260
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:56,200
But my boyfriend is Bai Feili.

261
00:15:56,360 --> 00:15:58,520
He is not easily knocked down.

262
00:16:04,880 --> 00:16:06,480
Have you ever seen snow fall?

263
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:10,400
You handed me the win?

264
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,320
I'm serious.

265
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,520
Before in Suzhou,

266
00:16:16,520 --> 00:16:18,640
you haunted me.

267
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:22,240
The wind blew sweet-scented osmanthus off the trees that day.

268
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:24,160
For a moment,

269
00:16:24,560 --> 00:16:26,400
I thought it was snowing.

270
00:16:29,520 --> 00:16:31,080
After the show,

271
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:32,360
I will take you to see the snow.

272
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:37,200
There're so many things

273
00:16:37,520 --> 00:16:39,200
I want to do with you.

274
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,400
I'm afraid there is not enough time.

275
00:16:45,520 --> 00:16:46,760
Don't worry.

276
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:49,560
We have a long, long life ahead of us.

277
00:16:50,520 --> 00:16:52,360
It is still not enough.

278
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,080
Then live each day to the fullest.

279
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,760
If we do one thing a day,

280
00:16:59,320 --> 00:17:01,760
we can do seven things a week.

281
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,240
In a year,

282
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:04,359
we can do

283
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,000
365 things.

284
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:07,440
OK?

285
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:10,760
You're right.

286
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:14,160
By the way,

287
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,240
put hands over your ears.

288
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:24,040
It's not my ears. It's your ears.

289
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:29,800
Press left and right.

290
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:31,600
This is

291
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:34,120
the sound of walking in the snow.

292
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:53,400
Forget it.

293
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,440
Stop looking for it

294
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:56,400
Let's try again.

295
00:17:58,440 --> 00:17:59,880
Do you know that?

296
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:01,640
The key to my house

297
00:18:01,880 --> 00:18:03,360
was found

298
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:04,360
in the trunk of the scooter you sold.

299
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:06,480
What else can't we find?

300
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:08,960
What Yu Fei and I caught

301
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:10,240
was your key?

302
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,080
The school will start classes soon.

303
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:16,720
I have to go back.

304
00:18:18,920 --> 00:18:20,080
What kind of school

305
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,800
starts at such a strange time?

306
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,000
It's far away,

307
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,520
with vast prairies as far as the eye can see.

308
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:32,800
No wonder you like this place so much.

309
00:18:35,040 --> 00:18:36,040
If I hadn't come here,

310
00:18:36,040 --> 00:18:37,440
I wouldn't have seen you, Dao Ge.

311
00:18:39,240 --> 00:18:41,200
Our transportation is so inconvenient

312
00:18:41,680 --> 00:18:42,600
that

313
00:18:42,800 --> 00:18:44,360
we may never see each other again.

314
00:18:46,080 --> 00:18:47,080
The private rocket is almost

315
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,280
ready to carry people into space.

316
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:50,080
How inconvenient it can be to go to your place?

317
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,480
I'll meet you

318
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:52,920
if you can't make it.

319
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:54,720
Forget it.

320
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:56,720
Don't betray the earth.

321
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,960
It's just a goodbye,

322
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:02,960
but you make it look like forever farewell.

323
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,000
You call me brother,

324
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,320
but I didn't teach you something good.

325
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:12,080
I only asked you to do things for me.

326
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,320
I didn't know what I was supposed to do,

327
00:19:15,640 --> 00:19:17,480
so I'm hanging out for so long.

328
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:19,320
Thanks to you.

329
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,720
I know how to run a nightclub now.

330
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,480
I'm gonna go back

331
00:19:24,920 --> 00:19:27,200
and open a shiny, fancy nightclub.

332
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:29,000
Well,

333
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:31,160
don't force your guests to drink God Dragon set.

334
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:32,720
If anything happens,

335
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
I can't help you.

336
00:19:35,680 --> 00:19:37,280
But, if I get the chance,

337
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,680
I really want to go to your club.

338
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:42,360
At that time,

339
00:19:43,320 --> 00:19:44,640
you can look up at the sky.

340
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:46,800
The stars

341
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:48,480
are the lights of my club.

342
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,920
I have something big to do.

343
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,160
When I'm done,

344
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:00,080
I'm going somewhere.

345
00:20:01,720 --> 00:20:02,720
The only thing

346
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:04,360
I can see right there

347
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,360
is the sky.

348
00:20:07,480 --> 00:20:08,880
Brother, what are you going to do?

349
00:20:12,640 --> 00:20:13,240
Don't you usually

350
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,720
have superpowers?

351
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:17,160
Why does it take you so long to find something today?

352
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:18,560
Well,

353
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:27,440
isn't that just right?

354
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:29,960
I'm leaving tomorrow,

355
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,120
so I can spend more time with you.

356
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,240
Tomorrow?

357
00:20:34,520 --> 00:20:35,560
What's the rush?

358
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:39,400
Well,

359
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,200
stop looking. Come and sit here.

360
00:20:41,720 --> 00:20:42,360
A lot of things

361
00:20:42,360 --> 00:20:44,000
will show up when you're not looking for them.

362
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:00,280
Sit.

363
00:21:07,480 --> 00:21:09,520
Are you comfortable sitting there? Sit here.

364
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:13,800
You‘re

365
00:21:13,800 --> 00:21:15,200
a real pain in the ass.

366
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:17,080
How can you open a nightclub?

367
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,040
Actually,

368
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,080
I‘ve always wanted to ask you a question.

369
00:21:39,880 --> 00:21:40,960
What question?

370
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:43,840
I don't think your eyes are quite like ours.

371
00:21:46,440 --> 00:21:47,640
Our family

372
00:21:47,640 --> 00:21:48,920
a...all have eyes like that.

373
00:21:55,040 --> 00:21:55,680
Zhu,

374
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,440
I'm gonna miss you.

375
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:00,120
I will miss you, too. Brother.

376
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:19,320
Live broadcast?

377
00:22:20,960 --> 00:22:22,800
The clout of Jiubai has continued unabated.

378
00:22:23,240 --> 00:22:24,880
Since those netizens love us so much,

379
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,880
instead of fighting in their field,

380
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,320
we should

381
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,480
bring them to our field.

382
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,920
But 70% of the audience

383
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,440
refunded their tickets.

384
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:36,400
Wouldn't it

385
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,840
be the team building of

386
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:38,960
Jiubai's trolls

387
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:41,040
if we met them on air?

388
00:22:41,680 --> 00:22:42,880
Then turn them into the audience of Jiubai

389
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:45,000
with the Dream of South.

390
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
But if we do the live stream on the first day,

391
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:47,880
are the audience still willing

392
00:22:47,880 --> 00:22:50,000
to buy tickets in the future?

393
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,640
They could have watched it for free.

394
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,520
For those audience who have bought tickets

395
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:56,160
but haven't refunded them,

396
00:22:56,360 --> 00:22:58,400
it's a bit unfair.

397
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,200
They can watch free vlogs about traveling.

398
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,920
Why do so many people

399
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,200
want to see it for themselves?

400
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:11,320
It's not so much that we're broadcasting a stage play

401
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,280
as that

402
00:23:12,680 --> 00:23:14,560
we're taking the audience

403
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:15,840
to a world

404
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,120
they have never been to before.

405
00:23:19,200 --> 00:23:20,640
People who have watched livestream

406
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,120
will want to see it live.

407
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:23,640
People who have been on the scene

408
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,840
will feel it's worth it.

409
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,040
Yes, yes. I think so, too.

410
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:29,760
The difference between livestream and scene...

411
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:31,520
I think this...

412
00:23:31,520 --> 00:23:33,160
It's okay. I trust him.

413
00:23:36,120 --> 00:23:37,760
It's been so long.

414
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:38,680
Don't you

415
00:23:38,680 --> 00:23:40,960
miss being on stage?

416
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:44,240
Yeah.

417
00:23:44,600 --> 00:23:45,760
Our goal

418
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:47,240
is to get on the New Year's Eve party anyway.

419
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:47,140
♫ I have not forgotten. ♫

420
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:49,040

425

OK. I'll contact the video team.

429
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,640
on the same scale as the Olympic opening ceremony,

430
00:23:58,640 --> 00:23:59,360
OK?

431
00:24:00,120 --> 00:24:00,680
By the way,

432
00:24:00,680 --> 00:24:02,360
in a sense,

433
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:03,600
the studio and theater

434
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,120
are also a kind of cross-dimensional wall.

435
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:06,240
Yeah.

436
00:24:06,360 --> 00:24:07,680
Well, in that case,

437
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:08,760
what are we waiting for?

438
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:09,960

♫ The look on our faces as we parted ♫

♫ tells the same fate. ♫

443
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:24,240

00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,640
is on the same day.

doesn't mean we can't fight together.

Li Shaoyan

487
00:26:50,520 --> 00:26:53,280
is indeed the best

488
00:26:53,280 --> 00:26:54,800
in our class.

489
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,560
If I only sing

490
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,160
the same as him,

491
00:26:58,600 --> 00:27:01,320
I must be the loser.

492
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:07,040
Do you know?

493
00:27:08,120 --> 00:27:09,680
When I was a kid,

494
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:11,520
my mom

495
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:13,600
probably thought I had a gift for art,

496
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:16,040
and made me learn a lot of things,

497
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,880
singing, dancing

498
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:20,080
and so on.

499
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:22,400
And I'm still holding on to it.

500
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,360
Then

501
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:27,320
I got into the stage business.

502
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:29,880
I also regards stage play as an art form.

503
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:33,040
I always think

504
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:35,240
art

505
00:27:35,720 --> 00:27:37,200
is God's world.

506
00:27:39,040 --> 00:27:41,320
Its biggest difference from the human world is that

507
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:43,640
it has no boundaries.

508
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:46,920
There's a term called zero-sum game.

509
00:27:47,560 --> 00:27:48,560
It refers to

510
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:51,160
the competition between people.

511
00:27:52,200 --> 00:27:53,480
If one party gains,

512
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:56,520
then the other party must lose.

513
00:27:57,840 --> 00:27:58,520
This is also because

514
00:27:58,520 --> 00:28:00,600
the human world is limited.

515
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,040
But art is different.

516
00:28:04,200 --> 00:28:05,560
Art is creation.

517
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,120
It has no boundaries.

518
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,680
Performers

519
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:19,600
should enjoy the performance itself.

520
00:28:20,840 --> 00:28:22,680
As long as there're wins and loses,

521
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,960
there will be pain.

522
00:28:28,680 --> 00:28:29,920
Do you think

523
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:32,640
you're gonna lose to Li Shaoyan?

524
00:28:36,160 --> 00:28:38,800
He sings like Master Yu.

525
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,960
Even Nan Lao said that

526
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,120
he would be Wu Zixu.

527
00:28:45,640 --> 00:28:47,240
Your greatest advantage

528
00:28:47,520 --> 00:28:49,320
is not being more like Wu Zixu,

529
00:28:50,560 --> 00:28:51,600
but

530
00:28:52,760 --> 00:28:54,240
rolling with the punches

531
00:28:54,240 --> 00:28:55,760
when things change,

532
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:58,200
and you don't give in

533
00:28:58,560 --> 00:28:59,760
no matter what the odds are.

534
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,120
What do you mean?

535
00:29:03,880 --> 00:29:05,320
I mean,

536
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,720
you're a lion yourself.

537
00:29:10,800 --> 00:29:12,400
Not making any changes

538
00:29:13,280 --> 00:29:15,000
is your greatest advantage.

539
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:23,320
Well, I'm gonna go rest.

So I play your idol,

00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:45,600
to cheer you on.

00:32:46,080 --> 00:32:47,640
Are you crazy?

577
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:49,440
You smiled.

578
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:50,520
It seems that my costume

579
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:52,800
has a very good effect on relieving tension.

580
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:55,680
Who told you I'm nervous?

581
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,080
I'm just a little excited.

582
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,200
As the saying goes,

583
00:33:02,200 --> 00:33:03,400
there're only two kinds of people in this world,

584
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:05,520
those who like Peking Opera

585
00:33:05,520 --> 00:33:06,160
and those

586
00:33:06,160 --> 00:33:09,480
who don't know they like Peking Opera.

587
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:13,480
Anyway, you're the funniest kind of guy.

588
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,400
But

589
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:18,040
you're also the one I want to say thanks to.

590
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,960
You don't have to.

591
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:25,600
We've been friends for so many years.

592
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,640
At least I'm your brother.

593

the beauty of our Perking Opera.

596

Just relax

597
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,920
and enjoy the stage today.

598
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:54,040
You too.

599
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:55,680
Forget about the gains and losses.

600
00:33:58,160 --> 00:33:59,880
When I was kid,

601
00:33:59,880 --> 00:34:01,680
I always thought I was in the Shandengting troupe for my mom.

602
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,120
And I sang well for my uncle.

603
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:07,400
But now I understand

604
00:34:07,400 --> 00:34:10,199
why I took to Perking Opera in the first place.

605
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:12,199
Today,

606
00:34:12,199 --> 00:34:14,000
I'm going to shoot the works,

607
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,320
not to win you.

608
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,320
but for my passion

609
00:34:17,639 --> 00:34:19,719
of Perking Opera.

610
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:23,000
It's not easy to carry the banner

611
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:24,239
of inheriting Peking Opera.

612
00:34:24,600 --> 00:34:25,719
This time

613
00:34:27,040 --> 00:34:28,760
I sing for myself.

614
00:34:37,000 --> 00:34:38,000
Yu Fei.

615
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,159
Wu Zixu is ready to play.

616
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:41,360
We are almost done with the backup roles.

617
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:42,800
Why aren't you wearing your makeup?

618
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,760
I‘ve sworn

619
00:34:46,360 --> 00:34:48,159
not to dress up on the stage for three years.

620
00:34:48,639 --> 00:34:49,760
The time hasn't come yet.

621
00:34:50,120 --> 00:34:51,360
This will be what I wear.

622
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,159
Take your time.

623
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,560
You've been through enough.

624
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:08,360
Today,

625
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,520
you can dress up.

626
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,800
After I finish this,

627
00:35:26,960 --> 00:35:28,240
the oath will be broken.

628
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:30,320
I

629
00:35:31,160 --> 00:35:32,520
made you swear,

630
00:35:34,280 --> 00:35:35,720
and I made you break it.

631
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,360
No one can force me

632
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:42,200
if I don't want to.

633
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,760
If I had a choice,

634
00:35:51,080 --> 00:35:53,360
I probably wouldn't have taken this path.

635
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:56,000
But fortunately,

636
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,160
I made the choice,

637
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:01,720
so...
