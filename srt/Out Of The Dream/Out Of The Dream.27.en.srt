[Episode 27]

4
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:04,110
♫ In the dim light, I stroke your profile against the candle light. ♫

5
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:04,360
I dreamed

6
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,560
that I was lost with everyone

7
00:02:05,190 --> 00:02:11,430
♫ In tipsy state, let my missing send me to sleep. ♫

8
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:07,800
I knew,

9
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:11,160
even forgetting who I was.

10
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:13,400
I had to keep running

11
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,520
♫ Under the silent night sky, loneliness scatters around, ♫

12
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,800
and ran through a sea of bamboo.

13
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,200
The shadow of bamboo branches

14
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:24,120
♫ resting on the sleepless lights. ♫

15
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:22,240
was mingled with unknown dangers lurking everywhere.

16
00:02:23,600 --> 00:02:24,880
All the way,

17
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:26,920
my only company

18
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:31,120
♫ Light and shade staggered, the moon shines over you and me. ♫

19
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,200
was a lion.

20
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:32,800
I was afraid of it at first,

21
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:39,000
♫ Embrace each other's weaknesses, and don't miss anymore. ♫

22
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:35,200
fearing its beastlike part

23
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:37,680
which I could't know about.

24
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,520
But along the way,

25
00:02:41,079 --> 00:02:42,760
we got hurt;

26
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,280
we got lost;

27
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:48,940
♫ Time passes quickly, don't let go of my hand. ♫

28
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:47,240
we went on by encouraging each other.

29
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,960
As we approached the end,

30
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:52,079
♫ Can we hold each other all the time? ♫

31
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,760
it suddenly disappeared.

32
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:58,530
♫ Write the eternal that we all want. ♫

33
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,760
♫ Love will know, when memories fade. ♫

34
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:09,840
♫ you'll still be in my heart. ♫

35
00:03:06,680 --> 00:03:08,760
I wanted to find the lion

36
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:10,200
and told it that

37
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:12,360
I was so brave

38
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,360
to make a choice,

39
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:16,160
to run towards

40
00:03:16,160 --> 00:03:18,040
the vast jungle,

41
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,480
and to embrace it without fear.

42
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,640
When I finally found it,

43
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:31,440
♫ With the passion, you fight against the silent world. ♫

44
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:28,840
I wouldn't let it go.

45
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:32,680
I gradually discover,

46
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,810
♫ It moves me to expose my deepest tenderness. ♫

47
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,240
in my heart,

48
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:37,240
there is also a beast.

49
00:03:38,810 --> 00:03:45,060
♫ We confess weaknesses and remember past wounds. ♫

50
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:43,520
We are not just protecting each other,

51
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,960
but standing side by side.

52
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:51,860
♫ We look at each other with an urge to embrace. ♫

53
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,720
No matter in a hubbub,

54
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,520
or in loneliness,

55
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:55,320
we face the giant world together.

56
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:57,440
I can be brave enough to say that

57
00:03:55,860 --> 00:04:01,090
♫ Time passes quickly, don't let go of my hand. ♫

58
00:03:58,040 --> 00:03:59,560
I will always be myself,

59
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:02,520
who is irreplaceable

60
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:04,590
♫ Can we hold each other all the time? ♫

61
00:04:02,520 --> 00:04:04,280
by any perfect scenery,

62
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:05,840
who will become weak,

63
00:04:05,090 --> 00:04:10,840
♫ Write the protection that we all persist in. ♫

64
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:07,680
expose ugliness,

65
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:10,360
and worry about gains and losses.

66
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:16,339
♫ Love will know, when memories fade. ♫

67
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:22,590
♫ I'll still wander in that dream. ♫

68
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,320
The electricity is off at home.

69
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,120
Where's your grandparents?

70
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:36,600
They were invited to give lectures.

71
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,320
Come in first.

72
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:06,160
I'm sorry.

73
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,840
Did I get you in trouble?

74
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:17,200
Before Lou Shitang came to you,

75
00:05:17,640 --> 00:05:19,320
the die was cast.

76
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,360
I came to him,

77
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,520
just afraid he might hurt you.

78
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:29,160
But I'm glad

79
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:31,200
you're okay.

80
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:39,840
If anything,

81
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:43,280
I'm the one

82
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,320
who's got you in trouble.

83
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:08,800
Yu Fei,

84
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,800
I don't want to be in love with you now.

85
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,440
You know that.

86
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:23,400
I'm somewhat abnormal

87
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:24,760
in my mind.

88
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:33,600
Then what is normal?

89
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:35,680
Van Gogh didn't see

90
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,960
the same stars as we do.

91
00:06:37,760 --> 00:06:40,000
Beethoven could even hear moonlight.

92
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:41,760
You just...

93
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,400
You just can see

94
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,280
something that we can't.

95
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:50,080
Just because

96
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,400
you see a different world,

97
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:53,520
are you abnormal or are you sick?

98
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:55,600
Is it sickness to be different from others?

99
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,400
Is it sickness to

100
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:00,880
have sadness, depression

101
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,360
or unhealed wounds?

102
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,240
Even if it's sickness,

103
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,640
so what?

104
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:08,920
Or do you think,

105
00:07:09,200 --> 00:07:10,440
you're sick,

106
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:11,240
you're different,

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,600
so you're extraordinary?

108
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:14,000
OK, let me tell you.

109
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:16,200
I'm sick too.

110
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,320
I'll get pimples on face when I stay up late.

111
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,040
When it rains outside,

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,760
my body will be sore and aching.

113
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,680
If I don't eat properly,

114
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:27,720
I'll get stomach problems.

115
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:30,480
- Is that I am also sick? 
- Little fool.

116
00:07:36,280 --> 00:07:37,960
You told the star

117
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,960
you would never leave me again.

118
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,880
And I will

119
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:48,840
never let you run away anymore.

120
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:52,620
♫ Canoe adrift on the sea ♫

121
00:07:53,250 --> 00:07:57,580
♫ Or wind across the forest ♫

122
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:54,680
Let's get married.

123
00:07:58,330 --> 00:08:01,910
♫ Fury against kindness ♫

124
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:03,280
Will you

125
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:06,910
♫ Crowds are silent but also turbulent ♫

126
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,480
marry me?

127
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,260

♫ I won't let you go ♫

130
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:25,120
♫ Like a beast breaking out of the cage ♫

131
00:08:21,560 --> 00:08:22,560
Thank you for

132
00:08:24,280 --> 00:08:26,240
keeping this bracelet with me.

133
00:08:25,330 --> 00:08:29,700
♫ Rushing through the winding river and against the roaring wind ♫

134
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:30,600
From now on,

135
00:08:30,250 --> 00:08:34,559
♫ Even if I shout in despair ♫

136
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,440
I'll never be afraid that,

137
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,400
if I give it back to you,

138
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:36,640
♫ The hidden pain of the past ♫

139
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:38,559
you'll leave me.

140
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:39,580
♫ The whisper of passing time ♫

♫ Memories like bubbles, and pains like chains ♫

143
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:47,440
Fragrans bracelet.

144
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:52,840
♫ You hug me and run away from all this ♫

145
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:51,640
Do you know that?

146
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:54,160
It seems that

147
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:55,160
♫ We've struggled to shout ♫

148

My love for you

152
00:09:02,680 --> 00:09:05,280
was just initiated that day under the osmanthus tree.

153
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,950
♫ Me under the spotlights ♫

♫ Time flies and life is transient ♫

164

00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:15,960
Well,

343
00:21:16,680 --> 00:21:18,800
I think I left it in the Jiubai studio.

344
00:21:19,160 --> 00:21:20,320
What?

345
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,720
I think I plugged it into the computer.

346
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,360
This door is not even locked.

347
00:21:42,560 --> 00:21:44,080
What if there's someone in there?

348
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:45,440
Even if there's someone,

349
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,000
we must get the USB today.

350
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:48,240
Watch out.

351
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,840
It feels so exciting.

352
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,600
I've never done anything like this.

353
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:54,400
Like the hero of Mission Impossible.

354
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,080
If you've been the hero,

355
00:21:57,440 --> 00:21:58,920
I must become cool as well.

356
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:16,760
It's so dark here.

357
00:22:16,760 --> 00:22:18,680
How do we find it?

358
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,280
Come on.

359
00:22:20,920 --> 00:22:21,680
Look at me.

360
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,000
Let's put it inside.

361
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,160
Guanjiu, you're really good.

362
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,520
How resourceful you are!

363
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:36,560
Go.

364
00:22:45,480 --> 00:22:46,960
Be careful.

365
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,160
Where is it?

366
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:02,320
It's plugged there.

367
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,000
Are you silly?

368
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:06,920
Where else can it be?

369
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:15,280
Bro,

370
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:17,600
I'm still at work right now.

371
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:21,560
Of course I want to change a job

372
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:24,720
but the point is that jobs are scarce these days.

373
00:23:25,720 --> 00:23:27,560
Keep an eye for me if you have any good jobs.

374
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:30,280
Okay, okay.

375
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:34,520
Chocolate,

376
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:37,560
Are you going to

377
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,680
holding the pose today?

378
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:50,000
Do you like me?

379
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,400
Want to go out with me?

380
00:23:58,160 --> 00:23:59,160
Then what?

381
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,120
Then we'll get married,

382
00:24:02,760 --> 00:24:04,000
have a child,

383
00:24:04,760 --> 00:24:06,440
and shoulder a 30-year mortgage.

384
00:24:07,640 --> 00:24:09,240
We'll get up 5 times a night

385
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,000
to feed and change the baby.

386
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,280
We'll quarrel about

387
00:24:13,280 --> 00:24:15,280
whether the child should go to public or private school.

388
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,440
We'll quarrel over whose home to go to for the Spring Festival.

389
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:22,040
I'll be out of shape

390
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:23,240
and develop wrinkles.

391
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:26,080
You'll be bald and have a beer belly.

392
00:24:27,280 --> 00:24:28,520
One day,

393
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:30,760
we'll poop in front of each other

394
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,320
with the bathroom door open.

395
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:38,120
Even if I'm always around you,

396
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:40,760
you'll never have feelings for me again.

397
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:44,080
When you get home from work,

398
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,280
you'd rather sit in the nearby children’s playground

399
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:48,560
than go upstairs

400
00:24:48,560 --> 00:24:50,600
to face the messy life.

401
00:24:53,320 --> 00:24:54,440
At that time,

402
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,760
you'll think of today,

403
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:01,480
October 29,

404
00:25:01,720 --> 00:25:03,160
7: 49 in the evening.

405
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,760
And you'll realize

406
00:25:06,520 --> 00:25:08,200
the so-called "like"

407
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
is just a moment of life

408
00:25:09,920 --> 00:25:12,640
so illusory and fleeting.

409
00:25:15,480 --> 00:25:17,600
It will be as brief as if it never existed.

410
00:25:20,760 --> 00:25:21,840
I won't.

411
00:25:22,800 --> 00:25:24,160
I will always like you.

412
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Even you can give up your dream?

413
00:25:29,880 --> 00:25:31,360
Even then,

414
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,360
I won't like a man

415
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:35,760
who easily gives up his dream.

416
00:25:43,720 --> 00:25:46,160
To exchange to Parsons is a great opportunity.

417
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:49,400
Don't miss it.

418
00:25:56,320 --> 00:25:57,840
I've got the USB.

419
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:01,080
Let's get out of here.

420
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:05,480
You go to the door and see

421
00:26:05,680 --> 00:26:06,840
if the security guard's gone.

422
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:37,320
They say

423
00:26:37,440 --> 00:26:39,440
if you get the second button of him,

424
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:40,520
you'll

425
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:42,680
get to the nearest place to his heart.

426
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,280
The sudden storm tonight

427
00:27:06,280 --> 00:27:08,160
caused congestion on many roads of the city.

428
00:27:08,160 --> 00:27:10,120
Attention should be paid

429
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:12,320
to plan your travel route and time

430
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:13,800
as well as travel safety.

431
00:27:13,800 --> 00:27:15,320
Let's look at today's Weibo.

432
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,300
[Waste sorting is just a lift of the finger.][Serving chopsticks and spoons help to dine in a civilized way. ]

433
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:16,960
The home page of many listeners

434
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:18,760
must have been full of this breaking news.

435
00:27:18,760 --> 00:27:20,440
Recently, there's a man

436
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,160
who went viral,

437
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:23,320
Chinoiserie stage play producer Bai Feili.

438
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:24,320
Just now,

439
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:26,000
a 3 min video of him

440
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:28,320
performing in women's clothes was released,

441
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,800
which is jaw-dropping.

442
00:27:29,800 --> 00:27:31,560
It has got reposted million of times,

443
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:34,280
and even caused a 4 min blackout on Weibo.

444
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:35,640
Many netizens commented

445
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,960
it was absolutely shocking.

446
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:52,220
[Zhan Garden]

447
00:28:00,560 --> 00:28:02,240
His name is Bai Feili,

448
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:04,320
the son of Shang&Shan Group,

449
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:06,840
who's been trapped in negative news lately.

450
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:07,880
I compared

451
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,680
Bai Feili's audio on Talking Stage

452
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,040
with Ruoshui's singing in the battle.

453
00:28:11,040 --> 00:28:12,720
I'm not watching it. Pause.

454
00:28:15,080 --> 00:28:16,200
In fact,

455
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:17,920
these netizens are quite talented.

456
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:20,480
That's right.

457
00:28:20,600 --> 00:28:22,520
They fulfilled one of my wishes.

458
00:28:22,520 --> 00:28:23,560
Which wish?

459
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:25,600
They showed me you

460
00:28:25,880 --> 00:28:27,680
with 8-pack abs.

461
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:36,280
I've already had 8-pack abs.

462
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:38,800
No, you haven't.

463
00:28:39,920 --> 00:28:40,680
I have.

464
00:28:41,080 --> 00:28:42,720
Where is it? Let me see.

465
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,520
Wait. Wait. Wait. Stop. Stop.

466
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,240
There's one more thing I want to ask you.

467
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:55,080
What's wrong with

468
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:56,440
your little lion?

469
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:04,480
If you dare,

470
00:29:04,480 --> 00:29:05,600
show me

471
00:29:05,600 --> 00:29:07,040
your little lion.

472
00:29:07,920 --> 00:29:08,960
Do you dare?

473
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,440
It is so naughty

474
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,080
that it got dirty.

475
00:29:20,560 --> 00:29:21,920
That's too miserable.

476
00:29:23,320 --> 00:29:24,600
Isn't yours miserable?

477
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:30,160
Mine is pretty naughty, too.

478
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:32,240
It went out and had a battle.

479
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:37,600
Why did you send it to battle?

480
00:29:37,880 --> 00:29:39,680
How cruel of you!

481
00:29:40,240 --> 00:29:41,040
I'm not...

482
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:42,200
Not?

483
00:29:43,040 --> 00:29:44,280
It's just for

484
00:29:45,000 --> 00:29:47,000
the peace of world.

485
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:48,440
For the peace of world,

486
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:51,640
you sent your lion to battle?

487
00:29:52,360 --> 00:29:53,120
Right.

488
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,480
You'll pay a price for it.

489
00:29:54,840 --> 00:29:55,760
I was wrong.

490
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:58,800
Spare me, Mr. Lion. I won't do that again.

491
00:30:01,880 --> 00:30:02,480
By the way,

492
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:03,640
The new shop near the school

493
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:05,560
is amazingly delicious.

494
00:30:05,680 --> 00:30:07,040

The video of Mung Bean Ice Cream Boy

497

was posted on the campus BBS.

Though you didn't show your face,

499
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:26,360
we could tell

500
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,920
it was you singing Xiang Yu.

501
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,800
But you needn't care about them.

502
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:31,760
They just envy that,

503
00:30:31,760 --> 00:30:32,720
in the first year,

504
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,520

Let's go out.

Just take her as invisible.

00:30:52,320 --> 00:30:53,280
What are you doing?

512
00:30:56,000 --> 00:30:57,280
Just take me as invisible.

513
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,280
Go on.

514
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:02,160
Let me help you eat some

515
00:31:02,480 --> 00:31:04,120
so that you won't gossip

516
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:05,200
and be stuffed to death.

517
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:07,560
Yu Fei.

518
00:31:07,800 --> 00:31:09,280
Why are you so arrogant in front of us?

519
00:31:09,640 --> 00:31:10,560
I heard that

520
00:31:10,560 --> 00:31:13,080
the school leaders have discussed it with Nan Lao,

521
00:31:13,080 --> 00:31:14,080
suggesting he

522
00:31:14,080 --> 00:31:16,600
cancel your role in Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period.

523
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:19,240
Go and ask your rich boyfriend

524
00:31:19,240 --> 00:31:21,600
to buy you a small part.

525
00:31:21,960 --> 00:31:23,440
Come on, rich boyfriend?

526
00:31:23,440 --> 00:31:24,720
Haven't you watched the news?

527
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:26,520
His father was led away.

528
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:29,400
Why else would he be with Yu Fei

529
00:31:29,400 --> 00:31:31,080
and play for the boss

530
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:32,680
they newly sponged on?

531
00:31:32,680 --> 00:31:34,120
You said

532
00:31:34,120 --> 00:31:36,320
the school leaders have discussed it with me.

533
00:31:36,230 --> 00:31:39,750
[Art creates your dream. Dream builds your future.]

534
00:31:36,920 --> 00:31:39,480
You're pretty close to the school leaders.

535
00:31:39,920 --> 00:31:41,280
Did you hear about it

536
00:31:41,280 --> 00:31:42,480
before I did?

537
00:31:43,280 --> 00:31:44,800
Nan Lao.

538
00:31:47,080 --> 00:31:47,880
Yu Fei.

539
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,240
Come over here.

540
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,280
How's the video going?

541
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:05,840
Very good.

542
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:09,120
It has drawn a lot of attention as we wish.

543
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,920
It's just hard

544
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:13,000
to avoid some unwanted voices.

545
00:32:14,280 --> 00:32:15,400
Didn't you

546
00:32:15,880 --> 00:32:17,400
do bad things with good intentions?

547
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:20,120
Wasn't it your idea

548
00:32:20,120 --> 00:32:21,640
to make a video and put it online?

549
00:32:22,040 --> 00:32:24,040
Since I did it with good intentions,

550
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:26,240
then they can't blame me.

551
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,640
What if Miss. Yu Fei asks?

552
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:31,280
Isn't she your friend?

553
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,760
Whoever is useful to Mr. Lou

554
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:36,840
will be my friend.

555
00:32:39,280 --> 00:32:40,960
But didn't you

556
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:42,560
blot out Yu Fei's face

557
00:32:42,840 --> 00:32:44,160
in the video?

558
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,520
I've helped her enough with her career.

559
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:52,520
I should give her a favor emotionally.

560
00:32:53,480 --> 00:32:55,600
But there's no fun in attacking too fast.

561
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:57,320
The cards

562
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,880
have to be played one by one.

563
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,680
Well,

564
00:33:01,840 --> 00:33:03,840
haven't you been protecting her?

565
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,000
It all depends on whether you want me to protect her.

566
00:33:12,960 --> 00:33:15,000
You can even sacrifice

567
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,960
and betray your favorite person.

568
00:33:19,080 --> 00:33:20,400
Maybe one day

569
00:33:21,440 --> 00:33:22,920
you'll betray me too.

570
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,000
All we boors know

571
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:29,120
is to get revenge against hostility.

572
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:32,280
Since Mr. Lou has been kind to me,

573
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:34,280
I'll certainly not bite the hand that feeds me.

574
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,640
You did a good job on this matter

575
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,080
and progressed very well.

576
00:33:42,840 --> 00:33:44,360
I'll do better

577
00:33:46,480 --> 00:33:48,160
on another matter.

578
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:00,560
Nan Lao.

579
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:02,920
If I'd been a little late,

580
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:04,640
you'd splashed the soup.

581
00:34:05,600 --> 00:34:06,840
I've never seen

582
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:10,000
a student who loses her cool so easily.

583
00:34:11,199 --> 00:34:12,920
I did lose my cool.

584
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,120
If you're really removed this time,

585
00:34:16,120 --> 00:34:17,480
what are you going to do?

586
00:34:20,920 --> 00:34:22,199
Then I'll go for a battle.

587
00:34:23,120 --> 00:34:24,560
Li Shaoyan sings in the theater

588
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:26,000
and I'll sing right outside the theater.

589
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,320
I'm not trying to outdo him.

590
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:30,360
I just feel like

591
00:34:30,560 --> 00:34:31,360
I can't live up to

592
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,679
a character I love.

593
00:34:34,239 --> 00:34:35,560
You know, kid.

594
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,080
Walking like a breeze.

595
00:34:38,360 --> 00:34:39,440
Sitting like a bell.

596
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:42,679
This remark is not merely for posture,

597
00:34:43,679 --> 00:34:45,800
but also for an attitude towards life.

598
00:34:46,679 --> 00:34:48,159
In addition to charging forward,

599
00:34:48,360 --> 00:34:49,440
you have to learn

600
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:50,840
to be tough

601
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,040
after the setback

602
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,159
and be indifferent

603
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:55,120
to whatever others say.

604
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:56,360
Understand?

605
00:34:57,680 --> 00:34:58,880
I see.

606
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,360
Everything as usual.

607
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,040
Continue to practice Wu Zixu.

608
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,000
But

609
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,280
you have to get rid of

610
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,760
your hot temper.

611
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:12,520
Thank you, Nan Lao.

612
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,560
I'm not the one you should be thanking.

613
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:16,400
It was Ni Lin.

614
00:35:19,600 --> 00:35:21,440
During the school meeting,

615
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,240
in front of all school leaders,

616
00:35:23,240 --> 00:35:25,800
he personally guaranteed that

617
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:27,240
you are not wrong.

618
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:28,840
After all,

619
00:35:28,840 --> 00:35:30,600
you're still in school.

620
00:35:30,600 --> 00:35:32,160
If he didn't say that,

621
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,280
I wasn't able to protect you.

622
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:42,110
[the Shandengting troupe]

623
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,400
In your opinion,

624
00:35:40,760 --> 00:35:42,480
why do people love gossip?

625
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:45,480
Stability is less lively that turmoil.

626
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,560
Satisfaction

627
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:49,000
is not as exciting as twists and turns.

628
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:50,720
It's just like our playbooks

629
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:52,920
which are all about love and hatred.

630
00:35:52,920 --> 00:35:55,080
Nobody wants to watch everyday life.

631
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,960
That's no excuse for starting a rumor.

632
00:35:56,960 --> 00:35:58,040
Even worse,

633
00:35:58,040 --> 00:36:00,320
they found out what he did or said

634
00:36:00,320 --> 00:36:02,200
five or ten years ago.

635
00:36:02,200 --> 00:36:03,480
How could they do that?

636
00:36:03,480 --> 00:36:04,600
If they count it that way,

637
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:06,280
I once cursed the uncle.

638
00:36:06,280 --> 00:36:08,400
When uncle forced me to practice,

639
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,520
I once cursed him.

640
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,320
When Master and uncle

641
00:36:11,320 --> 00:36:12,840
kicked the sister out,

642
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:13,760
I once...

643
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,400
Uncle, you're here.

644
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,560
Un...uncle.

645
00:36:23,000 --> 00:36:24,160
I...I...

646
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:25,840
I cursed you

647
00:36:25,840 --> 00:36:27,840
totally out of ignorance.

648
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,280
You

649
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:31,440
were just for our good.

650
00:36:31,440 --> 00:36:32,520
Right?

651
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:42,800
A...a little stain.

652
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,440
The audience won't see it, uncle.

653
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:45,720
The audience won't see it,

654
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,360
so you pretend it's not there?

655
00:36:51,040 --> 00:36:51,880
Huizi.

656
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:54,080
Clean it up.

657
00:36:54,080 --> 00:36:55,200
Okay, uncle.

658
00:36:57,600 --> 00:36:59,560
Where's Yu Fei's artificial whisker?

659
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:10,880
Sister only used it once.

660
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,920
And I've been holding it for her ever since.

661
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,960
Bring me the artificial whisker in Wu Zixu.
