I just click my sister's Friend circle.

What happened?

You're dumb.

Nobody will open that website.

What a trash.

25
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,120
But it's surely beneficial

26
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:52,520
for my sister's dumb brain.

Why is Guanjiu still not here?

28
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:04,600
This could not be her.

29
00:03:04,600 --> 00:03:05,920
They look completely different.

30
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,160
No, she's not her.

31
00:03:07,160 --> 00:03:08,680
Ugly.

32
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:10,520
Can't believe Guanjiu is Guan Zhijiu.

33
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:14,040
How does it feel

34
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:14,800
to be your wife's colleague?

35
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,560
Tell me, tell me.

36
00:03:15,560 --> 00:03:16,640
Stop.

37
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:17,800
She destroyed everything.

38
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,880
Everyone has seen her.

39
00:03:19,880 --> 00:03:21,800
I was blinded

40
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,360
How can I fall for her million-worth

41
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,680
photoshop skill.

42
00:03:25,160 --> 00:03:26,240
Unlike You Jia,

43
00:03:26,240 --> 00:03:27,560
youthful and adorable.

44
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:28,720
Oh please.

45
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,600
I have been staying up and working recently,

46
00:03:32,600 --> 00:03:34,800
can't you see my eyes are black.

47

That's how Internet company works.

Six days a week from 9 A.M to 9 P.M.

49
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,600
Aren't we all working over time?

50
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:42,000
Unlike someone.

51
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,320
Guan Zhijiu.

52
00:03:59,320 --> 00:04:01,280
Deputy director wants you to come.

53
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:09,760
Here comes the karma.

54
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:13,480
Come in.

55
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,120
You know why you're here?

56
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,120
Look.

57
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:29,880
It's you, right?

58
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:31,840
What I do after work

59
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,240
is none of anyone's business.

60
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:36,640
There're several blogs trending in the company's intranet.

61
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:38,040
I just can't understand

62
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:40,000
what's the meaning behind

63
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,280
these nonsenses.

64
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:42,960
You got what you want.

65
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:44,640
But that's not what our department wants.

66
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:45,640
I don't care

67
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:46,840
how they perceive us.

68
00:04:48,920 --> 00:04:50,320
The result of the 3/6/1 annual evaluation

69
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:51,800
is out.

70
00:04:52,280 --> 00:04:53,280
You did great.

71
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,000
You're not in the top 30%,

72
00:04:56,600 --> 00:04:58,080
neither in the

73
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,960
average 60%.

74
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,040
You're well aware that the last 10%

75
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,360
will get kicked out.

76
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,600
Sure.

77
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:08,040
I know,

78
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:10,560
you're not bad at the job.

79
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:12,840
But all your score

80
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:14,040
got from your colleagues

81
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,280
are F.

82
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,160
Think.

83
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,400
Who do you get along well with?

84
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,200
Who have invited you

85
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:22,440
to a group event?

86
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,400
If it wasn't because of me,

87
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,520
you won't be here talking.

88
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:28,360
I do not come here

89
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:30,760
to make superficial friends

90
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,080
I'm here

91
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,800
because I need a job and money.

92
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,520
Money,

93
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,480
and that nonsense hobby.

94
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,880
That's how you keep a job?

95
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,800
What else do I need then?

96
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:51,200
Nancy.

97
00:05:51,640 --> 00:05:53,000
Fire Guan Zhijiu.

98
00:05:54,159 --> 00:05:55,560
According to the company's policy,

99
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,080
you need to make compensation of N+1 Months' salary,

100
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,160
along with the bonus from last month.

101
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,320
Don't miss a dime.

102
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:16,320
Having a Teleportation Door

103
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,600
is what I want the most

104
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,560
when I was watching Doraemon as a child.

105
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:22,760
Even in my lowest

106
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:24,560
and worst time,

107
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:27,000
as long as

108
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,000
I can leave the mess behind me with that door,

109
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,040
I can go to a place where I truly belong.

110
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,240
Now I have my door

111
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,320
right here.

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:44,200
Wait.

113
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,320
Here.

114
00:06:48,320 --> 00:06:49,840
Add one more move.

115
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:50,920
But I think…

116
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,280
Jiuye is here.

117
00:06:52,920 --> 00:06:54,440
What's that?

118
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:55,520
Crayfish.

119
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:56,440
Crayfish?

120
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:57,200
Hurry up, hurry up!

121
00:06:57,200 --> 00:06:58,360
Jiuye brought us crayfish!

122
00:06:58,360 --> 00:06:59,120
Hurry, hurry.

123
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:01,560
Hurry up, come on!

124
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:03,640
Lobster. Wait for me!

125
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,640
Jiuye, you won lotto or what?

126
00:07:05,640 --> 00:07:07,280
Oh god, these smell so good.

127
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:09,440
Those are not from Boston.

128
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,240
Stop exaggerating.

129
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,440
Still it costs two to three hundred yuan.

130
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,320
Hurry.

131
00:07:15,640 --> 00:07:16,560
Thank you guys

132
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,320
for working really hard on Dragon Scale.

133
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,000
I'll buy you big lobsters

134
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,320
after it's done.

135
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,840
For real?

136
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:25,320
Did anyone film his speech?

137
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,120
Yeah.

138
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:28,400
Do I look like those who never keep his promises?

139
00:07:28,600 --> 00:07:30,640
No, of course not.

140
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,200
But we'll save the evidence, okay?

141
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:32,880
I've filmed it.

142
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:33,680
Boston lobster, no problem.

143
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,360
It's in mind now.

144
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:37,880
Where's Guan Shan?

145
00:07:40,040 --> 00:07:41,920
Boss left right after the clock ticked.

146
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,400
Buy food, he said.

147
00:07:43,400 --> 00:07:45,120
Can you be dumber?

148
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:45,560
Right.

149
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:48,320
He's obviously dating.

150
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:50,400
Picking his favorite girl.

151
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,720
I knew it.

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
He's surrounded

153
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,760
by pink bubbles recently.

154
00:07:55,240 --> 00:07:56,000
That's what it is.

155
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:57,120
Nosy.

156
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:58,120
What a dummie.

157
00:07:58,120 --> 00:08:00,080
Boss is a tough guy, but…

158
00:08:00,080 --> 00:08:01,280
Some people

159
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,680
will leave from this door as well.

160
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,080
that's probably because

161
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,440
the one he loves more

162
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:11,200
lives in the outside world.

163
00:08:25,040 --> 00:08:26,240
What are you doing?

164
00:08:28,520 --> 00:08:29,520
Hey.

165
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:31,080
Come here.

166
00:08:37,679 --> 00:08:39,000
What is the flower for

167
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,159
tonight's dinner?

168
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:47,840
They gave me for free when I was buying the food.

169
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,560
What market would gave you flower instead of chive?

170
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:51,880
They ran out of chives.

171
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:06,480
What, how?

172
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,960
Bai Feili went to the market today.

173
00:09:09,960 --> 00:09:10,920
He got a bunch of roses

174
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:12,560
from the food seller.

175
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:13,920
That's why I made you guys

176
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:15,880
Rose tofu eggs.

177
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:17,680
Okay.

178
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:20,120
Decorating it with rose

179
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,320
looks really pretty.

180
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:22,360
Good.

181
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,120
Xiao Bai, tomorrow you go there again,

182
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:28,000
Don't accept her roses.

183
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,600
Take lilies instead.

184
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,840
It's a good ingridient to make poridge.

185
00:09:31,440 --> 00:09:32,240
That's Lily bulbs

186
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,760
Not flowers.

187
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,280
Both works anyway.

188
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:41,520
Xiao Yu.

189
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:43,440
My grandson

190
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,760
is a lovely child.

191
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,240
Yeah, he is.

192
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:49,280
He's just heartbroke recently.

193
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,600
He's not in the mood.

194
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,160
It doesn't matter.

195
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:56,600
I'm here to cook.

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,560
You don't have to tell me

197
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,840
about your private matters.

198
00:09:59,040 --> 00:09:59,600
Okay, sure.

199
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,520
Have a drumstick.

200
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,680
Thank you.

201
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,400
What's so special about today?

202
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:05,400
It's our anniversary.

203
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,840
No, our first-date anniversary

204
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:09,440
is in fifteen days,

205
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,200
right?

206
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:12,880
Eat, no talk.

207
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:14,000
Well, you didn't ask me.

208
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:15,520
Xiao Bai,

209
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,240
what's the day today?

210
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:18,920
Tuesday.

211
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:21,480
I remember someone promised me last week

212
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:23,280
to do something this week.

213
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,000
Bring the girlfriend home.

214
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,320
So,

215
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
where's she?

216
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:32,240
Where's the girl?

217
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,360
Which one?

218
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,280
How many did you have?

219
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,800
What are you saying?

220
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:44,560
You have only dated one girl,

221
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:46,720
and somehow you just let her run away.

222
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:47,720
Right.

223
00:10:47,720 --> 00:10:49,240
We never see her.

224
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:54,000
What's the point?

225
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,920
She's not beautiful.

226
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,560
Have nothing to be proud of.

227
00:10:57,120 --> 00:10:59,360
Clumsy.

228
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,000
And bad limbs coordination.

229
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:05,360
I'll get you the soup.

230
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:07,920
I made the Spicy sour soup today

231
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,000
specially for you guys.

232
00:11:10,040 --> 00:11:10,880
However,

233
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:12,920
I just tasted it,

234
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:14,760
Not enough spice.

235
00:11:14,760 --> 00:11:16,720
I'll add some more for you.

236
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,840
Petty and a bad temper;

237
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,680
vindictive and revengeful;

238
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:25,840
and loves snoring.

239
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:27,400
Who snores?

240
00:11:27,800 --> 00:11:29,600
How do you know she doesn't snore?

241
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,280
I guessed it.

242
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:36,320
Anyways,

243
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,360
he's like Zhang Fei.

244
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:39,640
Zhang Fei?

245
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:40,760
No, no, no.

246
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,400
Xiao Bai,

247
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:44,080
You're

248
00:11:44,280 --> 00:11:46,680
the grandson of a Chinese professor.

249
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:49,200
That's not a thorough review of Zhang Fei.

250
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,200
Zhang Fei actually made

251
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:55,040
a very solid and successful figure.

252
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,960
He looks tough on the surface,

253
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,600
but deep inside

254
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,440
lies a tender self.

255
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:02,360
He's smart about that.

256
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:06,560
Wrong bowl.

257
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,720
Want water?

258
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,800
Read after me.

259
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:18,960
Deep breath, deep breath.

260
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,600
It's already 10:15.

261
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,200
The bus is leaving soon.

262
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:38,720
Shang Lao.

263
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,480
I'm having this feeling.

264
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,080
So do I.

265
00:12:58,800 --> 00:12:59,640
All done.

266
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,560
I'm leaving.

267
00:13:01,400 --> 00:13:02,720
All done.

268
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:04,920
Have you cleaned it up?

269
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:10,680
Messy.

270
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:15,480
There's oil everywhere.

271
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,240
And dust.

272
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:21,880
I just wiped it out.

273
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:23,640
It's impossible.

274
00:13:25,280 --> 00:13:26,080
Do it again.

275
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:30,680
You're being jealous.

276
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:43,920
Move.

277
00:13:58,280 --> 00:13:58,920
Hey.

278
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:01,000
A reminder.

279
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:03,880
Don't fall in love with me.

280
00:14:03,880 --> 00:14:05,320
Just say it.

281
00:14:05,560 --> 00:14:07,640
See the screenshot I sent you?

282
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:15,760
Five hundred likes.

283
00:14:16,080 --> 00:14:17,320
How?

284
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,760
I've got my way.

285
00:14:20,280 --> 00:14:22,640
How are you going to thank me?

286
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:23,520
Give yourself to me?

287
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:25,640
I'll pass.

288
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,320
I'm just going to be your servant in the next life.

289
00:14:27,320 --> 00:14:29,040
Just forget the next life.

290
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:30,200
How about tonight?

291
00:14:35,400 --> 00:14:37,480
Talk later, see you.

292
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,280
Done. Can I go now?

293
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,560
See you.

294
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,840
See? Screenshot also works

295
00:14:53,840 --> 00:14:56,320
I'm such a genius.

296
00:14:57,880 --> 00:14:59,320
Your Yu Fei,

297
00:14:59,320 --> 00:15:01,200
didn't say goodbye to you,

298
00:15:01,640 --> 00:15:02,640
neither did she willing to

299
00:15:02,640 --> 00:15:04,120
go on a date with you tonight.

300
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:06,440
Doesn't matter.

301
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,120
I know her well.

302
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:08,920
She must be mesmerized

303
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:10,840
by my charisma

304
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,040
right now.

305
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:15,680
Our hard work didn't go in vain.

306
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:17,120
We got the five hundred likes.

307
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:32,640
I can't take it anymore.

308
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,060
# [Don't forget to bring the notebook home]

309
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,280
I forgot to bring my notebook again.

310
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:46,600
Why are you here?

311
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:50,560
What a coincidence.

312
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:53,600
I'm here to buy some.

313
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,280
Want to roam around?

314
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:07,280
No.

315
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:14,240
You forgot your notebook.

316
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,400
Study comes first.

317
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,480
Thanks.

318
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,160
I'm going.

319
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,440
Aren't we

320
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:37,640
going for a ride?

321
00:16:57,120 --> 00:16:59,640
I've lost it twice.

322
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:02,160
I can't afford to lose you again.

323
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:06,760
When's the last time?

324
00:17:08,560 --> 00:17:10,040
I won't tell.

325
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:18,560
Why this page got ripped off?

326
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:20,760
Is it you?

327
00:17:22,800 --> 00:17:24,839
Why would I do that?

328
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:27,480
Right.

329
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,640
We've been waiting forever.

330
00:17:34,640 --> 00:17:36,160
Which bus you're taking?

331
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,280
Eleven.

332
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:41,040
Does No. 11 bus pass this stop?

333
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:44,240
This eleven.

334
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:48,640
I walked past this station

335
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,840
every time I go home.

336
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:54,320
If I'm tired,

337
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,400
I'd sit here

338
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,240
and listen to music

339
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,720
while appreciating the view across the street.

340
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,040
In fact, none of the bus

341
00:18:00,040 --> 00:18:01,920
can take me to my home.

342
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:04,960
You see,

343
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,400
going to the Oriental Pearl Tower costs two hundred yuan;

344
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,480
eating in the revolve restaurant

345
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:12,120
costs at least four hundred yuan.

346
00:18:12,600 --> 00:18:14,800
But sitting here,

347
00:18:14,800 --> 00:18:15,880
I can have the most beautiful night view

348
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,800
of Shanghai for free.

349
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,840
Great deal.

350
00:18:21,520 --> 00:18:23,120

464
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,280
Yeah, sure.

465
00:25:22,720 --> 00:25:23,760
Then,

466

we all need to be in the low once.

474

00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:13,800
Okay, I got it.

526
00:29:13,800 --> 00:29:15,480
You've had all well-planned.

527
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:16,240
Can we just..

528
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:17,440
Can you just let go of me?

529
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,960
Let me go.

530
00:29:23,240 --> 00:29:24,240
What are you looking at?

531
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:26,640
Sorry.

532
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,000
Continue.

533
00:29:29,720 --> 00:29:31,120
What's happening?

534
00:29:35,040 --> 00:29:36,200
Dear customer,

535
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:38,560
How do you act so cool

536
00:29:38,560 --> 00:29:40,880
when exiting the awkward scenario.

537
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:44,360
They were kissing like it's the last day,

538
00:29:45,400 --> 00:29:47,200
like there's no tomorrow.

539
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,160
Nobody cares about me.

540
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:54,520
Then why don't you rush to them?

541
00:29:55,160 --> 00:29:56,800
Yu Fei already told me

542
00:29:56,800 --> 00:29:58,160
when we were in Suzhou.

543
00:29:58,160 --> 00:30:00,080
This guy is a liar.

544
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:02,680
There are only two possibilities when kissing a liar:

545
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,080
one,

546
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,960
she's doing undercover;

547
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:08,280
two,

548
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:10,640
she's scammed.

549
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:12,000
Apparently the first possibility

550
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:13,280
is impossible.

551
00:30:14,000 --> 00:30:15,640
Confrontation

552
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:17,440
is no good for our end.

553
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,880
I have to bear it myself.

554
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:29,000
Collecting evidence of his lies.

555
00:30:30,040 --> 00:30:31,320
Then when the time comes,

556
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:33,840
I'll hand it over to the girl I love the most.

557
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,680
You're always waiting.

558
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:40,400
But opportunity waits no one.

559
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:41,520
You have already

560
00:30:41,520 --> 00:30:43,040
missed the chance

561
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:44,480
to be with your girl.

562
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:46,040
Why not seize the opportunity?

563
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:50,800
Liar.

564
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:53,600
Liar!

565
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,600
We've been circling here.

566
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:07,160
Well.

567
00:31:07,160 --> 00:31:08,920
What do you suggest?

568
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:15,760
If I say I want to go home,

569
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:18,360
will he accompany me?

570
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,600
What if he says he wants to go upstairs to have water?

571
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:26,200
Should I say yes or no?

572
00:31:26,200 --> 00:31:27,720
How to reject people nicely

573
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:30,200
without being awkward?

574
00:31:31,280 --> 00:31:32,800
It's too late.

575
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,280
No water supply in my house today.

576
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,320
What happened to you?

577
00:31:39,160 --> 00:31:40,800
Okay, go.

578
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:42,560
Go where?

579
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
Why did I spill it?

580
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:47,920
I'm so dumb.

581
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:52,760
Good night.

582
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,440
Go to bed early.

583
00:31:57,880 --> 00:32:00,560
I'll take you to a place tomorrow.

584
00:32:03,200 --> 00:32:04,520
If we're going…

585
00:32:05,880 --> 00:32:07,240
We could skip.

586
00:32:08,800 --> 00:32:09,960
Leave tomorrow's business

587
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:11,760
to tomorrow.

588
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,800
I was really nervous.

589
00:32:28,320 --> 00:32:30,240
I looked like an amateur.

590
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:31,840
This is not working.

591
00:32:33,520 --> 00:32:34,520
Shuji.

592
00:32:35,400 --> 00:32:36,560
Do you have

593
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,560
speed-up dating education class?

594
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,280
I see.

595
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,080
Girls' talk.

596
00:32:51,080 --> 00:32:55,080
The secrets only for the girls.

597
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:57,760
Girls' talk.

598
00:32:58,240 --> 00:32:59,440
How do you know about that?

599
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,320
What do you know?

600
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,520
Wealth and beauty can be gained through diligent study.

601
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:11,600
You can have the digital version for only fifteen yuan.

602
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:18,640
As the old saying goes:

603
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,040
Receive red envelopes before sleep,

604
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,640
fortune

605
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:25,320
comes naturally.

606
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,800
First rule to a successful relationship:

607
00:33:31,880 --> 00:33:34,320
Act cute and be vulnerable.

608
00:33:35,720 --> 00:33:37,560
These are the musts.

609
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:48,960
Hey, Guige.

610
00:33:49,160 --> 00:33:50,120
I made a prototype

611
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:52,240
for this new project.

612
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:53,360
You should check

613
00:33:53,360 --> 00:33:54,480
the props.

614
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:55,320
How about this?

615
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,200
After Dragon Scale's finished,

616
00:33:56,200 --> 00:33:57,320
we will have our pocket filled.

617
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,920
After Dragon Scale's finished,

618
00:33:58,920 --> 00:34:01,000
I don't have to work at the sushi restaurant anymore.

619
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:02,680
We could go travel then.

620
00:34:02,680 --> 00:34:03,840
Sounds good.

621
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,320
Not me.

622
00:34:05,320 --> 00:34:06,760
I have to use the money for my son

623
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:08,639
on a robot competition in America.

624
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:09,280
Guige.

625
00:34:09,280 --> 00:34:10,280
I made Xiaole something.

626
00:34:10,280 --> 00:34:10,880
I'll bring it to you later.

627
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:11,840
You want to go there?

628
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:19,480
Who ordered hamburger?

629
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:21,120
Hamburger? Where?

630
00:34:21,120 --> 00:34:22,000
Guanjiu.

631
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,480
What are you doing here?

632
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:24,840
Ms. Guanjiu.

633
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:26,320
Aren't you working today?

634
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:28,520
Me?

635
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,199
Yes.

636
00:34:45,440 --> 00:34:46,679
I resigned.

637
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,040
And I want to come here

638
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:51,280
to finish Dragon Scale with you guys.

639
00:34:55,800 --> 00:34:56,880
Everybody's here.

640
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,080
Liu Xichan.

641
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:03,800
Why are you here?

642
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,720
Today is finally the day.

643
00:35:05,920 --> 00:35:07,880
Sorry squad, assemble!

644
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:11,000
What happened?

645
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,160
They've been preparing this for a long time.

646
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:15,040
Three, two, one!

647
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:24,160
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

648
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:32,640
We misunderstood you

649
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:34,000
at Suzhou Comic Con.

650
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,680
I shouldn't have called you the snitch.

651
00:35:35,680 --> 00:35:37,280
I'm sorry.

652
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:44,720
Yu Fei.

653
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:46,520
Come join Jiubai.

654
00:35:50,280 --> 00:35:52,560
You said you are just wandering.

655
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,640
You've become addicted to flee away.

656
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,600
I can't watch over you on my own.

657
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:58,960
It should be everybody's job.

658
00:35:59,520 --> 00:36:00,760
Stay.

659
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:10,360
Stay, stay, stay.

660
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:12,320
Got one seat for view left.

661
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:13,680
You take this seat.

662
00:36:14,080 --> 00:36:15,200
And do in Rome as Rome does,

663
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:17,000
give yourself a coser name.

664
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,400
Officially?

665
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,400
Then,

666
00:36:21,640 --> 00:36:22,960
Feng He.

667
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:24,680
Feng He, the one that means beautiful weather?

668
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:28,040
No.

669
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,160
Feng means wind and He means lotus.

670
00:36:31,080 --> 00:36:31,920
Well-educated.

671
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,560
Impressive.

672
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,320
Great name.

673
00:36:35,320 --> 00:36:36,280
Okay.

674
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:38,080
Start working, guys.

675
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,280
Work.

676
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:40,920
Start.

677
00:36:47,120 --> 00:36:47,920
Welcome.

678
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:51,560
Come, I'll show you around.

679
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,160
Boss has stopped creating

680
00:36:56,160 --> 00:36:58,560
after Yu Fei's comeback.

681
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:00,400
Thank you for the present.

682
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:01,840
Hope Xiaole likes it.

683
00:37:01,840 --> 00:37:02,600
Of course.

684
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:03,080
And you?

685
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,000
Slow down.

686
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:04,600
See you tomorrow.

687
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:05,520
See you tomorrow, Guige.

688
00:37:05,520 --> 00:37:06,920
See you.

689
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,000
Let's go buy boba tea.

690
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:10,240
You're not leaving?

691
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,120
Later.

692
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,440
Remember to close the door.

693
00:37:14,720 --> 00:37:15,320
Okay.

694
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:16,160
See you.

695
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:16,960
See you.

696
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:22,600
What?

697
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,240
Forgot to bring something.

698
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:28,360
I'm going now.

699
00:37:28,760 --> 00:37:29,520
Well.

700
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,120
I've prepared a dance

701
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,880
for your resignation as well.

702
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,920
Wait a minute.

703
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:49,240
Say bye bye to all your trouble.

704
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:53,400
Say hi hi to all your happiness.

705
00:37:53,400 --> 00:37:56,880
Ms. Guanjiu, be happy.

706
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,960
Everyday.

707
00:38:13,120 --> 00:38:14,320
Hungry?

708
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,040
Yes.

709
00:38:18,360 --> 00:38:19,040
Go.

710
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:22,440
Wait a minute.

711
00:38:29,920 --> 00:38:30,760
Wait for me.

712
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:50,920
This can't be done.

713
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,040
I gave up.

714
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:57,520
How come the breakdown van is not here yet?

715
00:38:58,080 --> 00:38:59,560
Then wait.

716
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:04,480
You can go home and do your homework.

717
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:05,960
Don't have to come all the way here

718
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:07,240
to accompany me.

719
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:10,440
Don't overthink.

720
00:39:10,880 --> 00:39:12,360
I just

721
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:14,360
want to ask you about English quizzes.

722
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,560
How about move in to Zhan Yuan.

723
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,600
This is nonsense.

724
00:39:27,040 --> 00:39:28,640
What I mean is,

725
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:30,680
you can move into the attic.

726
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:32,840
You have to come here every day anyway.

727
00:39:32,840 --> 00:39:34,960
And I have to coach you every day.

728
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:36,920
Instead of wasting time on road,

729
00:39:36,920 --> 00:39:38,280
you can just move in here.

730
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:41,680
Right.

731
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:44,200
What did you think I was going to do?

732
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:48,840
Take advantage of me.

733
00:39:48,840 --> 00:39:50,960
Make me your maid

734
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:52,200
and pay low wage.

735
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:54,080
You're really smart.

736
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,680
Will you do that?

737
00:39:55,680 --> 00:39:56,720
Of course

738
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,560
no.

739
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:02,320
Okay.

740
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,160
See when will the breakdown van come.

741
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,680
Act cute and be vulnerable.

742
00:40:23,600 --> 00:40:24,920
It's cold.

743
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,960
Cold?

744
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:31,880
Okay.

745
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:33,360
I'll call you a car.

746
00:40:33,360 --> 00:40:34,640
You go home and do your study first.

747
00:40:38,080 --> 00:40:40,320
I want to be with you.

748
00:40:41,320 --> 00:40:42,800
You just said it's cold here.

749
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,120
Then what are you waiting for?

750
00:40:48,080 --> 00:40:49,120
Right.

751
00:40:51,080 --> 00:40:51,920
You see,

752
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:54,200
flat tire doesn't happen often.

753
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,200
This is

754
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,120
a memorable event for both of us.

755
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:58,640
Am I right?

756
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:03,360
Nice clothes.

757
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:09,120
I get it.

758
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:11,000
I'll go to the mall

759
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:11,920
and see if they still have the same.

760
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
If they do, I'll buy you one.

761
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:17,080
Since it's a memorable event,

762
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,160
you can enjoy it on your own.

763
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:21,400
You know what to do

764
00:41:21,400 --> 00:41:22,520
when the breakdown van comes?

765
00:41:23,880 --> 00:41:24,840
It's cold for real.

766
00:41:27,080 --> 00:41:28,480
You did it on purpose.

767
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,480
Act like you didn't get me.

768
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:36,120
I'll call a car.

769
00:41:36,320 --> 00:41:38,320
Nobody wants to wait here.

770
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,240
You can wait hundreds of years

771
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:42,320
on this rubbish.

772
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,680
Not mine anyway.

773
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,280
I'm so dumb.

774
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:51,000
Wait for two hours!

775
00:41:52,080 --> 00:41:53,720
I'm a silly fool.

776
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:56,000
Nothing happens as the book showed.

777
00:41:59,080 --> 00:42:00,840
Am I not deserve to be the leading role?

778
00:42:08,280 --> 00:42:09,360
My girl,

779
00:42:09,800 --> 00:42:10,920
are you satisfied

780
00:42:11,960 --> 00:42:13,280
with this story?

781
00:42:16,080 --> 00:42:17,000
Fine.

782
00:42:19,200 --> 00:42:20,320
It's a pity that

783
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,280
the one showed up isn't Zeawo.

784
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:31,120
What's so good about him?

785
00:42:33,080 --> 00:42:35,040
The breakdown van needs more time to come.

786
00:42:35,800 --> 00:42:37,160
Can you just stay with me for a little longer？

787
00:42:57,360 --> 00:43:00,770
[Swaying boat]

788
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:05,730
[Gusting wind]

789
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,060
[Rage versus gentle]

790
00:43:10,820 --> 00:43:15,060
[Crowds are unsettling]

791
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,410
[Time flies by in a blink]

792
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,460
[No time left for innocence]

793
00:43:24,830 --> 00:43:28,970
[No letting go, no giving up]

794
00:43:29,460 --> 00:43:33,270
[Like beasts break through cages]

795
00:43:33,480 --> 00:43:37,850
[Survived the gulf-stream and storm]

796
00:43:38,170 --> 00:43:42,380
[Even shouting in the mess]

797
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:44,320
[The trauma of the past]

00:43:45,250 --> 00:43:46,950
[The time we had]

00:43:48,140 --> 00:43:51,610
[You put the makeup on me]

800
00:43:52,290 --> 00:43:56,600
[And I stand under the spotlight]
