[Episode 2]

4
00:01:43,400 --> 00:01:45,240
I dreamed of a lion,

5
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:48,039
lifting me up with one hand,

6
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:51,880
as if it were coming to punish me for my arrogance.

7
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:53,800
No,

8
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,000
this dream foretells that you will meet someone,

9
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,800
a very attractive,

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,720
strong and powerful man.

11
00:02:01,720 --> 00:02:05,200
He will become your lover.

12
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:02,360
You filthy bastard!

13
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:07,760
You promise not to throw up and I'll let go of my hand.

14
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,680
Take me home.

15
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:35,720
I still have to take some responsibility.

16
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:47,360
Is it a bit less?

17
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,520
Forget it, he can have them all.

18
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:10,500
[missed call Mom]

19
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:54,200
She's left so many things behind.

20
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,760
I heard that you found the Liu Xichan you wanted last night?

21
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:11,720
Yes.

22
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,480
Is it the woman who just left?

23
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,280
Yes.

24
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:22,960
And you brought her back here?

25
00:05:24,760 --> 00:05:26,520
What a responsible hotel!

26
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:28,360
They just allowed you to bring anyone in.

27
00:05:31,880 --> 00:05:33,840
This hotel is quite responsible,

28
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:35,600
even you can get the access card.

29
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,159
Can I be the same as her?

30
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:40,320
I'm your girlfriend.

31
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,640
Since when?

32
00:05:45,200 --> 00:05:46,320
Anyway,

33
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:47,960
I will be sooner or later.

34
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:53,920
Where is my dress?

35
00:05:55,040 --> 00:05:56,760
Where is Liu Xichan's dress?

36
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
It's not your dress anymore.

37
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,400
Guanshan.

38
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:12,240
I said I didn't want to act only on that day.

39
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:13,760
For a small role on your stage,

40
00:06:13,760 --> 00:06:15,600
I practiced Peking Opera for three months with zero foundation,

41
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,160
and even put off a film invitation.

42
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,160
How could you choose that kind of girl instead of me?

43
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:22,120
I'll give you one more chance.

44
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:23,960
Do you want her to play that role or me?

45
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,960
Whether she plays or not,

46
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:30,560
the role will not be yours.

47
00:06:33,480 --> 00:06:34,520
Okay.

48
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:36,560
Remember what you just said.

49
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,120
Li Hentian said recently he needed a female lead.

50
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,960
He went through a lot of trouble to get in touch with me.

51
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:44,480
Since you don't need me,

52
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,760
I'll go where I'm needed.

53
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,120
Wait.

54
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,240
Give me your access card.

55
00:06:57,040 --> 00:06:59,680
If you come in here without permission one more time,

56
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,000
I will call security.

57
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,480
Auntie?

58
00:07:19,480 --> 00:07:21,120
What took you so long to come back?

59
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:23,120
Come here.

60
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:24,480
What happened, auntie?

61
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:26,160
Where were you last night?

62
00:07:28,120 --> 00:07:30,680
I didn't leave the bar I'm working for until three o'clock

63
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:33,240
and at that time I was afraid of disturbing my mother,

64
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,640
so I found a place to stay for the night.

65
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,280
Give this to Hao Shi for me.

66
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:41,280
He's in his last year of high school and I'm afraid he's not getting enough nutrition.

67
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:42,640
I'm not even in the house yet

68
00:07:42,640 --> 00:07:43,680
and you're asking me to deliver something.

69
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:45,120
What an auntie you are to me!

70
00:07:46,640 --> 00:07:48,440
I'm doing you a favour.

71
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,040
Your mother is now like a pressure cooker,

72
00:07:51,040 --> 00:07:51,840
full of anger

73
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,159
and she is waiting for someone to take it out on.

74
00:07:53,159 --> 00:07:54,520
If she sees you,

75
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:56,080
she'll explode.

76
00:07:59,320 --> 00:08:00,280
Wait a minute.

77
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:01,760
Whose shirt is this?

78
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,200
It's definitely not yours.

79
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,400
Where did you get it?

80
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,840
Auntie, your meal should be cold,

81
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:07,200
I'll send it over to Hao Shi now.

82
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:09,640
And my mother...

83
00:08:09,640 --> 00:08:10,520
Leave her to me.

84
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:11,320
Go ahead.

85
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,400
Thank you, auntie.

87
00:08:35,280 --> 00:08:37,760
Where are you?

88
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:39,360
I'm right here at the door.

89
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,480
How come you can't find the place when you come for an interview?

90
00:08:43,320 --> 00:08:45,120
It's too loud to hear you.

91
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:46,320
I'm here at the door now, too.

92
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,680
but I don't see you.

93
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:49,280
Where are you?

94
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:51,120
I said I was...

95
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:51,640
I...

96
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:53,440
Sorry.

97
00:08:55,520 --> 00:08:56,920
You're Hao Shi, right?

98
00:08:56,920 --> 00:08:58,000
Sir Wuchang.

00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,440
This is in the "South Song",

the leading male and female roles' love token sky lantern?

101
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,800
Right. You do know something about it.

102
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,000
Mafang.

103
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:09,920
Are you Mafang Nanshan, the first dancer in Jiubai?

104
00:09:11,280 --> 00:09:12,400
So cool!

105
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,440
You're way cooler in person than in the videos.

106
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:15,280
Thank you.

Ma Fang, Master Guanjiu's in the booth?

108
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
Yes.

109
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:24,640
Master Guanjiu?

110
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,360
Let's go.

111
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,680
Help me carry the sky lantern.

Why are you not coming? Hurry up!

113
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:33,800
The one who will interview me is Master Guanjiu?

114
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,320
Yes.

115
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,800
Is it the

Jiubai chief cosplayer,

comic circle's No.1 domineering lady,

118
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:43,680
Tsinghua University's top student, the singer who passed all A,B,C,D stations,

119
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:45,080
Master Guanjiu?

120
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,520
So are you here for the interview

121
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,840
or are you here for a blind date with Boss Guanjiu?

122
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:51,440
No. No. I...

123
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:52,720
I am a huge fan of Master Guanjiu.

124
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:54,360
I'm not even ready today,

125
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:56,240
so I think I'll come back another day.

126
00:09:58,280 --> 00:09:59,440
Hold on!

127
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:00,320
You're here already.

128
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:01,600
Just give it a try.

129
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,280
She has read your resume

130
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:05,040
and is quite interested in you.

131
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:06,800
She's interested in me?

132
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:08,200
Yeah, she said you're pretty good.

133
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:09,840
That's even worse.

134
00:10:09,840 --> 00:10:11,080
My resume photo is photoshopped,

135
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:13,120
so if she thinks I'm... If she thinks I...

136
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:14,480
Come on, what are you worrying about?

137
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,520
She is already waiting inside.

138
00:10:15,520 --> 00:10:16,760
Hurry up！

139
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,440
Hurry up!

140
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:24,800
About the script of yours,

141
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:26,200
you just write according to the plot.

142
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,000
You don't have to think for the lighting switch.

143
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,200
I will have it programmed

144
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:31,480
and the computer will get it under control.

145
00:10:36,080 --> 00:10:38,680
Lift your head if you want to see.

146
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:40,920
Don't peek with your head down.

147
00:10:41,520 --> 00:10:42,840
You didn't make any mistakes,

148
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,160
and I'm no monster,

149
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,120
right?

150
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:46,680
I...I don't mean that.

151
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,680
A doglike fanboy with a catlike domineering lady.

152
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:57,040
It's the play you both are born to be in.

153
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:07,920
Guanshan is asking for you to go through the script.

154
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,080
Aren't you going?

155
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:15,280
Well, Hao Shi,

156
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:17,600
I thought you were a girl

157
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:19,360
when I saw how delicate the design you made was.

158
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,880
I...Did I forget to shave?

159
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,240
Did you draw all of these?

160
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:29,600
The skirt is really beautiful.

161
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,040
But what are you going to do

162
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,440
with the firefly effect?

163
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,680
LED lights will be sewn directly on the skirt.

164
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,720
So it can have a sense of light flow,

165
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:39,840
but also allows Master Guanjiu

166
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:41,160
to move on the stage.

167
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:42,680
Where do you hide the switch?

168
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:45,320
Switch...

169
00:11:45,320 --> 00:11:46,960
I can put a zipper control switch directly on the dress.

170
00:11:46,960 --> 00:11:48,680
With such a complex design,

That's...That's something I have never thought about.

After all, you have not done on-stage clothes before.

One of the rules in our studio

191
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,000
is to never hire students in high school.

192

322

It was also a sincere rejection.

323
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:47,440
This is for...

I'm not that cheap.

325
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,280
Get this shirt clean and then give it back to me.

I'm not done with you yet.

333
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,000
Why are you always coming to such weird places?

334
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,240

509
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,680
I'll go find them and avenge you.

510
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:25,480
Stop running!

511
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,000
Get out, you two!

512
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:28,680
Come here.

513
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:30,440
Stop running!

514
00:29:30,440 --> 00:29:31,960
I'm coming.

515
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,840
Well, it's nothing serious.

516
00:29:41,840 --> 00:29:43,560
I just watched the performance
 without buying a ticket.

517
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:44,360
Thank you.

518
00:29:45,800 --> 00:29:47,000
You're Yan Peishan, right?

519
00:29:49,800 --> 00:29:51,200
I'm Bai Feili.

520
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,040
Fei is from Feicui [jade]
and Li is from Fengherili [sunny]

521
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:56,480
CN Guanshan Qianchong.

522
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,560
What's the meaning of CN?

523
00:29:58,560 --> 00:29:59,680
The name of the cosplayer.

524
00:29:59,840 --> 00:30:01,600
I'm living with my grandparents.

525
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,040
They're retired teachers.

526
00:30:03,040 --> 00:30:04,320
I'm not investigating you.

527
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:06,720
You don't need to tell me so many details.

528
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:11,920
I want to invite you to

529
00:30:12,280 --> 00:30:14,240
act in our stage play South Song.

530
00:30:17,240 --> 00:30:18,880
I told you I wouldn't do it.

531
00:30:19,400 --> 00:30:20,560
Nor could I.

532
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,640
But you can perform.

533
00:30:25,080 --> 00:30:26,520
You're the person we need.

534
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:32,760
It was you that turned off the switch?

535
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,720
Your name is Bai Feili?

536
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:38,120
I remember it.

537
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,720
It's helpful when I call the police.

538
00:30:42,720 --> 00:30:44,440
But you slept in my bed.

539
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,880
So we are even 
 in terms of breaking laws and violating discipline.

540
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:49,440
Who slept in your bed?

541
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:51,000
So will you join us or not?

542
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:53,040
I'm not suitable for the role.

543
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,680
It will only take you one or two days,

544
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,560
and it's on weekend.

545
00:30:56,560 --> 00:30:57,920
It won't bother your work.

546
00:30:58,640 --> 00:30:59,480
As for the payment,

547
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:00,800
we'll pay you 
 in accordance with the industry standard.

548
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:01,960
You can also ask more.

549
00:31:01,960 --> 00:31:03,920
So money is the only way 
 for you to hire people?

550
00:31:06,320 --> 00:31:08,280
If you have any other requirements,

551
00:31:08,520 --> 00:31:09,800
just tell me.

552
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,760
I'll try my best to satisfy you.

553
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,360
I don't want money,

554
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,920
nor do I have any other requirements.

555
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,600
I just don't want to play.

556
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:22,280
Why are you here?

557
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:23,640
Didn't we agree to meet in Ronghua Hotel?

558
00:31:26,440 --> 00:31:27,440
Who is he?

559
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:31,760
Hello, I am

560
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:32,800
A liar.

561
00:31:33,040 --> 00:31:34,080
A liar?

562
00:31:34,840 --> 00:31:36,520
How dare you lie to us?

563
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:37,840
That's enough. Let's go.

564
00:31:37,840 --> 00:31:39,160
Let me help you punch him.

565
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:41,040
Punch what? It's so narrow here.

566
00:31:41,040 --> 00:31:42,800
You'll get me punched
 before punching him

567
00:31:44,200 --> 00:31:46,200
It's kind of difficult.

568
00:31:54,280 --> 00:31:56,040
What's the name of that man?

569
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,280
How did he dare to act wildly here?

570
00:31:57,280 --> 00:31:59,160
Didn't he know who control this place?

571
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:01,960
Never mind. He did nothing,

572
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:04,400
but invite me to act in a

573
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:06,160
stage play.

574
00:32:06,880 --> 00:32:10,040
My mom is seriously sick,

575
00:32:10,040 --> 00:32:11,480
so I want to spend more time with her.

576
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,080
What's wrong with your mom?

577
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,080
Stop it.

578
00:32:20,520 --> 00:32:22,120
You already knew it.

579
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,800
How did I know?

580
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:29,560
How

581
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:31,720
did you know it?

582
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:37,440
Well, why did you ask me to go fishing here?

583
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:42,480
As for your mom's disease,

584
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:46,200
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

585
00:32:47,040 --> 00:32:49,960
Well, I have to face it.

586
00:32:56,520 --> 00:32:57,880
If you want to cry,

587
00:32:58,160 --> 00:32:59,760
you can lean on 
 your elder brother's shoulder.

588
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,680
You're half a month younger than me.

589
00:33:02,680 --> 00:33:03,920
Don't take advantage of me

590
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:04,960
and be my elder brother,

591
00:33:12,680 --> 00:33:14,240
Actually I know

592
00:33:16,120 --> 00:33:18,000
we all will die,

593
00:33:21,880 --> 00:33:23,800
but I don't want to resign myself to it.

594
00:33:24,440 --> 00:33:27,720
I practised so hard when I was a kid

595
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:31,480
that my shoes couldn't fit my swollen feet,

596
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:34,840
but I thought I couldn't give up,

597
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,600
because someday

598
00:33:36,840 --> 00:33:38,160
my mom would say

599
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,760
my daughter is brilliant.

600
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:46,800
I heard

601
00:33:46,800 --> 00:33:48,880
there are lots of shows in Ronghua Hotel.

602
00:33:49,280 --> 00:33:50,760
Here are two tickets for you.

603
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:52,680
Thank you.

604
00:33:55,320 --> 00:33:56,960
My fish is biting! My fish is biting!

605
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:58,720
It's a large one.

606
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,000
A key!

607
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:07,720
What about fishing a treasure box?

608
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:10,120
Perhaps,

609
00:34:10,120 --> 00:34:11,639
it's a key to love.

610
00:34:21,400 --> 00:34:23,480
Are there too many sky lanterns

611
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:24,880
in the third and the fifth rows?

612
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:28,239
Are you still here talking about sky lanterns?

613
00:34:28,239 --> 00:34:30,320
So you screwed it up again?

614
00:34:30,320 --> 00:34:32,239
Bai Feili, what are you thinking about?

615
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:35,199
We've told the public that

616
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,159
South Song will be

617
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,120
the best-made

618
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:39,320
and the most splendid stage play

619
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:41,440
since the foundation of Jiubai Studio.

620
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:43,920
But there's still no one to act as Liu Xichan.

621
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:45,880
What should we do?

622
00:34:49,120 --> 00:34:50,480
Well,

623
00:34:52,159 --> 00:34:53,280
I depend on you.

624
00:34:53,760 --> 00:34:54,560
What?

625
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:58,480
You ask me to fix this? 
 It was you that made the heroine get mad.

626
00:34:59,080 --> 00:35:00,640
Help me arrange a meeting with Yan Peishan.

627
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:04,600
Fine.

628
00:35:04,600 --> 00:35:06,040
I'll see what I can do for you.

629
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,960
Why not reply? What happened to you?

630
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:19,240
Sir, turn on a computer for me.

631
00:35:20,680 --> 00:35:21,960
Adolescents under 18 are forbidden to come in.

632
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:23,160
I'm over 18.

633
00:35:23,160 --> 00:35:25,560
I've been a programmer for years.

634
00:35:25,560 --> 00:35:26,680
Which year were you born?

635
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:28,200
1990.

636
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,360
What's your zodiac?

637
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,320
I belong to you.

638
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:44,280
Uncle, please let me surf the Internet
 for only 10 minutes.

639
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,360
I won't play games,

640
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:46,680
nor will I scan any illegal websites.

641
00:35:46,680 --> 00:35:48,200
You can watch me by my side.

642
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:50,400
I just want to download an application form. 
 It won't be long.

643
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,160
Do you see that?

644
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:54,000
It's a monitor.

645
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,840
It's recording all the time.

646
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,400
It's also connected to the police station.

647
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Which school are you from？

648
00:35:59,360 --> 00:36:00,640
You don't learn from the good,

649
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,560
but learn to bribe.

650
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:03,560
Show me your student card.

651
00:36:03,560 --> 00:36:04,400
I'll call your teacher.

652
00:36:04,400 --> 00:36:05,200
Elder brother, please forgive me.

653
00:36:05,200 --> 00:36:06,720
I'm going. I'll never come again.

654
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:07,960
Come on ,show me your card. -Hao Shi

655
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,120
Why not stay at school?

656
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:11,400
What are you doing here?

657
00:36:16,520 --> 00:36:17,720
Mom.

658
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,720
Are you his mother?

659
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,360
Have you ever seen a programmer

660
00:36:29,360 --> 00:36:30,480
as young as you?

661
00:36:30,480 --> 00:36:31,960
Look at your thick hair.

662
00:36:33,400 --> 00:36:35,560
You have dressed improperly either.

663
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,880
A standard male programmer always wears

664
00:36:37,880 --> 00:36:38,880
black-rimmed glasses,

665
00:36:38,880 --> 00:36:40,960
a checked shirt and a backpack.

666
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,560
Whether or not you look like a programmer

667
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,800
doesn't depend on one or two words,

668
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,880
it's up to the details.

669
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,880
Details?

670
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,960
So your parents still don't agree you 
 to apply for College of Fashion?

671
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,120
Why?

672
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,080
By rights,

673
00:37:00,080 --> 00:37:02,200
I have the very advantages.

674
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:04,600
My father loves comic books.

675
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,000
My mother is carefree

676
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,840
who works in the clothing industry.

677
00:37:07,840 --> 00:37:09,480
With their influence,

678
00:37:10,280 --> 00:37:11,600
I want to study garment manufacturing,

679
00:37:11,600 --> 00:37:13,000
and I want to make clothes for stage plays.

680
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,480
But when she heard stage plays,

681
00:37:14,480 --> 00:37:15,640
she refused.

682
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:17,840
But I've made my mind.

683
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,920
I'll go to an internet cafe

684
00:37:18,920 --> 00:37:20,400
to print an application form.

685
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:22,840
My mother can do nothing when I pass the exam.

686
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,360
Are you sure about it?

687
00:37:25,720 --> 00:37:27,720
If I don't follow my heart,

688
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,640
I'll regret for the whole life.

689
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:33,120
Since then

690
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:35,280
I'll help you.

691
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,840
How?

692
00:37:36,840 --> 00:37:37,680
But,

693
00:37:38,120 --> 00:37:39,480
I have one condition.

694
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:41,240
What condition?

695
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:43,880
You need to tell me your cousin's schedule tonight.

696
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,240
Everything.

697
00:37:45,720 --> 00:37:46,840
My cousin?

698
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,560
Fine.

699
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:24,160
I bought some dishes from Songhe Restaurant

700
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:25,480
which are your favorite.

701
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,920
There is instant edible birds' nest.

702
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:40,400
I asked Xiao Dao to

703
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:41,480
get two tickets

704
00:38:41,480 --> 00:38:45,280
of Shen Chuanzhi's fan meeting tonight.

705
00:38:47,040 --> 00:38:48,720
You go to make up

706
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:50,200
and then we'll go.

707
00:38:52,680 --> 00:38:54,920
It's you that ask me to go.

708
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,120
Help me comb my hair

709
00:38:57,360 --> 00:38:58,840
and make me look elegant.

710
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:06,840
Use it.

711
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:13,400
Later,

712
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:16,000
you go to iron the peacock blue cheongsam for me.

713
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:18,880
But you like the dark green one best.

714
00:39:19,640 --> 00:39:21,200
Well,

715
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
I want to wear it when you become famous.

716
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,480
It's for celebration.

717
00:39:30,880 --> 00:39:33,520
There is a rosy red cheongsam 
 in the bottom of the box,

718
00:39:33,720 --> 00:39:35,520
which also is my favorite.

719
00:39:35,760 --> 00:39:38,160
I've planned to wear it at your wedding.

720
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:42,560
At my wedding, you wear a red cheongsam,

721
00:39:42,560 --> 00:39:45,080
so you want others to think 
 you're the bride？

722
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:51,800
Witnessing your success

723
00:39:52,160 --> 00:39:53,880
and seeing you get married，

724
00:39:57,200 --> 00:39:59,240
are my two wishes.

725
00:39:59,840 --> 00:40:02,120
I'm afraid that I can't wait.

726
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,680
So you must live longer.

727
00:40:11,720 --> 00:40:14,400
Look at you. Terrible hair style!

728
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:17,560
You're really not good at it. 
 Let me do it by myself.

729
00:40:22,280 --> 00:40:25,040
Go to iron the dark green cheongsam for me!
