Since you're praying for him,

why don't you ask him to come with you?

11
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,560
That's what the comic says.

12

If he comes, it won't work.

if you find it, it will come true.

for money now, right?

I'm not trying to say anything.

173
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,360
I just want to make sure

174
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,400
and warn you.

175
00:13:58,120 --> 00:13:59,520
I warn you, too.

176
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,840
Don't reinvent the wheel.

177
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,800
I told you,

178
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:08,080
I'll be watching you every step of the way.

179
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,360
If she gets hurt a little,

180
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:11,880
I'll show up

181
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,960
and take her away.

182
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,880
I won't let her get hurt.

183
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:17,840
I'm there for her.

184
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:19,360
You stand no chance.

185
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:23,560
Why was I the one with her to fly the lantern,

186
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,240
but not you?

187
00:14:32,840 --> 00:14:34,200
This is what Yu Fei risked her life

188
00:14:34,200 --> 00:14:35,320
trying to give you.

189
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:37,680
Some bosses out there are looking for you.

190
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:40,360
You'd better get their money.

191
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,240
Don't waste her kindness.

192
00:14:53,960 --> 00:14:55,800
Don't tell her I gave it to you.

193
00:15:07,720 --> 00:15:09,680
Dao Ge. Dao Ge.

194
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:11,040
Since you did it,

195
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:12,320
why don't you let her know?

196
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:13,600
You don't understand.

197
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,800
The main characters in the comics

198
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:17,720
always pay secretly.

199
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:23,520
Your brother, I,

200
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:26,120
also want to be a main character.

201
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,440
By the way, this is my business card.

202
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:44,240
It has my contact information.

203
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,240
If you have any questions,

204
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,320
please feel free to contact me.

205
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:47,720
OK… Keep in touch.

206
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,680
Xiao Bai.

207
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:04,800
Come here.

208
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Let me introduce.

209
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:11,560
This is Uncle Lou, my business partner.

210
00:16:12,440 --> 00:16:13,760
-Hello. -Hello.

211
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,600
I've heard so much about you from your father,

212
00:16:15,760 --> 00:16:17,200
Shang Lao and Shan Lao.

213
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:18,680
But this is the first time we've met.

214
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,920
I hope they all say nice things about me.

215
00:16:23,320 --> 00:16:24,440
I heard from your dad that

216
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:26,320
you are running a culture company.

217
00:16:26,600 --> 00:16:28,920
Aren't you gonna take over your father's business?

218
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,080
Mr. Bai is not ready to give it up yet.

219
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:34,440
No way. No.

220
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:37,320
The company is not a throne.

221
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:37,800
Yes.

222
00:16:37,800 --> 00:16:39,280
There's no inheritance.

223
00:16:39,680 --> 00:16:40,800
It's up to him.

224
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:43,240
By the way, Lao Lou.

225
00:16:43,720 --> 00:16:45,160
Come over for dinner in a few days.

226
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:48,280
Let's talk about the new company.

227
00:16:49,640 --> 00:16:51,240
Just send someone over.

228
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,000
It's my wedding anniversary.

229
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,320
Many important people are coming.

230
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,480
You have to come.

231
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:59,920
All right. As a courtesy to Xiao Bai.

232
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,359
OK. You guys talk. I have things to do.

233
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:05,680
It's nice to meet you.

234
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,480
Now everyone knows you're my son.

235
00:17:13,480 --> 00:17:14,640
He's gone.

236
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,400
Why don't you call me dad?

237
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:27,760
Xiao Bai.

238
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:29,720
If you need money,

239
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:31,480
why not come to me?

240
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:33,960
Someone else is going to invest in me anyway.

241
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:35,400
I don't need your money.

242
00:17:35,560 --> 00:17:36,680
You don't need my money?

243
00:17:37,600 --> 00:17:40,200
Is that a son talking to his father

244
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:41,760
or a boss

245
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:43,720
talking to another boss?

246
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,160
There's no father-son conversation

247
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,280
between you and me.

248
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:51,360
And I don't want to do business with people I can't trust.

249
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,440
You can trust no one in business.

250
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,720
I told the others to quit.

251
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,120
I'm the only choice you have right now.

252
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:06,360
Except money,

253
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:08,920
I can give you more resources.

254
00:18:09,640 --> 00:18:10,520
You have my word.

255
00:18:14,560 --> 00:18:16,000
I have your word?

256
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:21,440
I'm afraid it's just business.

257
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:25,840
I was going to have a drink with you.

258
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:27,320
But I still have something to do.

259
00:18:28,800 --> 00:18:29,560
Next time.

260
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,200
Next time, daddy takes you out for ice cream.

261
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,960
Next time, daddy will go to your opening ceremony.

262
00:18:45,160 --> 00:18:46,240
Daddy, I...

263
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:48,080
Next time.

264
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:49,920
Go.

265
00:18:57,440 --> 00:18:57,880
Dad!

266
00:18:57,880 --> 00:18:59,920
Daddy says, congratulations on your award.

267
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:02,520
He works so hard for us.

268
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:04,160
Daddy loves you very much.

269
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:06,520
Look, he got a present for you.

270
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:09,840
Next time. Dad will congratulate you next time.

271
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,800
I could go anywhere as long as you're with me.

272
00:19:24,080 --> 00:19:25,040
Next time.

273
00:19:32,920 --> 00:19:34,680
Cang, come here.

274
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:36,280
I got you extra food.

275
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,040
You have to remember me.

276
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,560
You can't bite me again. Huh?

277
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:52,120
You're playing with Cang again.

278
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,440
I'm giving it extra food.

279
00:19:58,440 --> 00:19:59,240
Sorry.

280
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:03,000
What happened? Why did you say sorry?

281
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:07,720
I got the money.

282
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:10,240
Really?

283
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,760
Today's not over yet.

284
00:20:12,960 --> 00:20:14,160
Let's go on a date.

285
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,280
Then close your eyes.

286
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:19,200
What are you doing?

287
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,560
Just do it. Be quick.

288
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:23,040
Be quick. Close your eyes.

289
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,960
Come with me. You can't open your eyes.

290
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:30,240
Where are we going?

291
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:31,720
Just follow me.

292
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:33,760
Are we there yet?

293
00:20:34,320 --> 00:20:35,800
We'll be right there. Don't ask.

294
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:42,840
OK.

295
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:44,520
Stand still.

296
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,120
Sit down.

297
00:20:50,680 --> 00:20:52,040
Can I open my eyes?

298
00:20:52,040 --> 00:20:52,760
Yes.

299
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:58,320
Welcome to Zhan Garden Camping Club.

300
00:21:01,080 --> 00:21:02,080
I know

301
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,960
you may have no time to go out.

302
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:04,960
So I

303
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,280
move camping to the house.

304
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,720
Next, let Xiao Yu introduce

305
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,280
this camping project.

306
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:15,360
We have a really good barbecue.

307
00:21:15,960 --> 00:21:16,760
Very delicious.

308
00:21:17,920 --> 00:21:19,400
And the bonfire over there.

309
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:23,160
And most importantly,

310
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:26,240
the little tent that I hand-painted myself.

311
00:21:26,680 --> 00:21:28,160
Three major elements are all here.

312
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:30,920
It's a low-profile version of camping.

313
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:33,720
Of course, you can also pay me

314
00:21:33,720 --> 00:21:37,440
280 yuan to unlock more themes.

315
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:43,440
I'm a friend of your boss.

316
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:44,960
Can I get a discount?

317
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,280
But my boss said,

318
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,000
people like you are rich.

319
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,520
I'm going to blackmail you.

320
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:55,960
Thank you.

321
00:21:57,160 --> 00:21:59,680
You're welcome. If you're satisfied,

322
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:01,240
please scan the code and pay the money.

323
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:05,000
Yes.

324
00:22:05,640 --> 00:22:08,640
Today, thanks to your amulet,

325
00:22:08,920 --> 00:22:10,040
I got the money.

326
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:12,000
This amulet...

327
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,280
Grey and blue said,

328
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:18,320
I should pay the money now.

329
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,160
You're going to get killed.

330
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,520
What did he buy?

331
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:49,520
It's so big.

332
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,520
It's not broken, is it?

333
00:22:56,920 --> 00:22:57,960
What a mess.

334
00:23:16,000 --> 00:23:17,720
Is this Bai Feili?

335
00:23:18,440 --> 00:23:20,280
He was so handsome when he was a kid.

336
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,480
Is this his mother?

337
00:23:56,320 --> 00:23:57,720
What are you peeping at?

338
00:23:58,960 --> 00:23:59,960
Nothing.

339
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,680
I got you a delivery.

340
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:06,400
So you spy on me

341
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,480
every day when I'm not around.

342
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:10,240
Fine…

343
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,200
Then I will never deliver your package

344
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:14,600
and clean your room again.

345
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,680
Let's go on a date tonight.

346
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,840
Didn't we just date

347
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:22,960
in the backyard yesterday?

348
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,920
Last night it was you who asked me out.

349
00:24:26,440 --> 00:24:28,560
Today I ask you out.

350
00:24:32,280 --> 00:24:34,400
I just spoke to your secretary.

351
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,640
He said,

352
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,560
you're free after 9 o'clock tonight.

353
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:39,520
My secretary?

354
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,920
Since when do I have a secretary?

355
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:42,840
It's me.

356
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:47,280
This delivery is for you.

357
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,280
I'll text you the address later.

358
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:51,760
I have things to do. I gotta go.

359
00:24:53,280 --> 00:24:54,480
You...

360
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:56,560
take your time peeping.

361
00:24:57,760 --> 00:24:59,120
I didn't.

362
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:02,000
Fine.

363
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:03,960
By the way,

364
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:06,760
today

365
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,360
is the 100th day.

366
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,000
What 100th day?

367
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:12,480
Of our love.

368
00:25:13,880 --> 00:25:14,520
I gotta go.

369
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:24,640
I can't believe he remembers days like this.

370
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:29,920
It's for me?

371
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:31,640
What's this?

372
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,000
Take that flower to the backyard.

373
00:26:49,480 --> 00:26:51,120
May I help you?

374
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,160
Xiao Bai.

375
00:26:58,040 --> 00:26:59,840
Our Xiao Bai is back.

376
00:27:02,080 --> 00:27:04,040
Ms. Zhuang, this is Xiao Bai.

377
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:04,960
Xiao Bai,

378
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:07,000
I haven't seen you for over a decade. I couldn't recognize you.

379
00:27:07,000 --> 00:27:08,120
Just get in there.

380
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,760
Don't bother.

381
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:12,160
I forgot today is your wedding anniversary.

382
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,440
I didn't bring a gift. I'd better come next time.

383
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:16,760
We are family. You didn't have to do that.

384
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:18,800
Come here. Come with mom, hurry up.

385
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:21,200
I think you're here to sign the contract with your dad.

386
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:22,920
Your father already told me.

387
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:24,600
Mom supports you.

388
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:25,480
Come here.

389
00:27:25,960 --> 00:27:27,720
This. I'll get your dad...

390
00:27:29,320 --> 00:27:30,880
You still have things to do.

391
00:27:30,880 --> 00:27:32,080
Don't bother.

392
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,360
I'll give it to him myself.

393
00:27:36,720 --> 00:27:38,400
I'm thinking

394
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:40,800
it's been a long journey for you.

395
00:27:41,080 --> 00:27:44,040
I want you to drink some water and get some rest.

396
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:46,960
Just a dozen kilometers.

397
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:48,400
And I was driving.

398
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:50,240
I'm not tired.

399
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:52,040
It's just a dozen kilometers,

400
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,720
but you have been driving for fourteen years.

401
00:27:58,280 --> 00:28:00,120
I can't believe you miss me so much.

402
00:28:00,800 --> 00:28:02,360
Maybe I should move back to live.

403
00:28:05,440 --> 00:28:06,560
You can do your own things.

404
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:13,040
Your father's study isn't there anymore.

405
00:28:13,520 --> 00:28:16,440
It's on the second floor, the second room on the right.

406
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:20,160
I thought you wouldn't come back to live here.

407
00:28:20,440 --> 00:28:22,200
The room is also empty anyway.

408
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:25,040
I hope you don't mind.

409
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,440
I remembered it was when you were in elementary school.

410
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,520
And you got a whipping.

411
00:28:56,360 --> 00:28:58,280
I took the football to my room to play.

412
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,480
You found out, but I lied to you.

413
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:02,920
I wish I had let you play football.

414
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:04,240
You wouldn't have been doing

415
00:29:04,240 --> 00:29:06,760
these things right now.

416
00:29:21,840 --> 00:29:23,680
I thought you didn't want to talk business with me.

417
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:25,960
You talked the others out of it.

418
00:29:26,360 --> 00:29:28,560
Don't you want to make money on your own?

419
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:32,920
Is that how you used to ask for favors?

420
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:34,640
No wonder after all these years,

421
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:36,440
it's still like a student group.

422
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:39,720
You must be thirsty.

423
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:42,240
Here. Have a glass of water.

424
00:29:45,040 --> 00:29:47,600
What about Xiao Bai's project?

425
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,600
If there's nothing wrong, just invest.

426
00:29:54,600 --> 00:29:56,440
It's good for kids if they want to do something.

427
00:29:56,440 --> 00:29:59,080
In that case, no one is gonna

428
00:29:59,080 --> 00:30:00,520
compete with you and your two nephews

429
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,160
for the company's position, right?

430
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:02,600
Lao Bai.

431
00:30:02,600 --> 00:30:03,800
Aren't you busy?

432
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:05,680
The guests should be here soon.

433
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,000
Fine, I'll leave you guys alone.

434
00:30:09,320 --> 00:30:10,520
Let me know if you need anything.

435
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,800
These high heels look nice.

436
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,600
Why are they so hard to wear?

437
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:36,640
Sister, take a smaller step.

438
00:30:37,400 --> 00:30:39,160
You just learn it. Don't fall over.

439
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,000
Smaller step, right?

440
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
Why am I swinging?

441
00:30:52,680 --> 00:30:53,560
No, no.

442
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:54,960
I have to take a break.

443
00:30:56,160 --> 00:30:57,040
Did you just say

444
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:59,160
I should wear some jewelries?

445
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,240
You're dressed like that,

446
00:31:00,240 --> 00:31:01,360
how can others see jewelries?

447
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,000
I even can't help you match it.

448
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:05,600
I think so.

449
00:31:10,800 --> 00:31:12,520
It's truly chosen by Boss，

450
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:15,560
making a poor girl into a beauty.

451
00:31:17,080 --> 00:31:18,600
A poor girl? Who are you talking about?

452
00:31:20,320 --> 00:31:21,400
I'll help you select.

453
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:29,840
This one.

454
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,440
Bring it to me.

455
00:31:41,320 --> 00:31:42,120
How's it?

456
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:44,200
These earrings are nice.

457
00:31:45,080 --> 00:31:48,160
Can I not wear these high heels?

458
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,520
Sister, I think you should

459
00:31:50,520 --> 00:31:51,680
see the boss's world.

460
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:53,760
About what you did,

461
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:54,640
what you ate and what you played,

462
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,080
he accommodated himself to you before.

463
00:31:56,840 --> 00:31:58,880
That's right. He liked you first.

464
00:31:58,880 --> 00:31:59,600
He pursued you.

465
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,200
But,

466
00:32:01,200 --> 00:32:03,160
now that you have decided to be together,

467
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:03,760
shouldn't you

468
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,280
go to his world to have a look?

469
00:32:06,080 --> 00:32:07,960
Only by doing this,

470
00:32:08,480 --> 00:32:09,400
can you know

471
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,760
whether you like him or not,

472
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,960
and whether you two fit each other.

473
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:14,560
In fact, falling in love

474
00:32:14,560 --> 00:32:16,400
is a process of getting to know yourself.

475
00:32:18,320 --> 00:32:19,600
Bad boy,

476
00:32:19,920 --> 00:32:21,560
where did you get so much love experience?

477
00:32:21,880 --> 00:32:22,880
You're in love?

478
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,560
I'm telling you,

479
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,080
don't call me boy or anything like that,

480
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:27,560
which makes me look small,

481
00:32:28,200 --> 00:32:29,760
especially in front of Guanjiu.

482
00:32:31,920 --> 00:32:33,760
It turns out to be a secret crush.

483
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,520
I told you I didn't.

484
00:32:35,920 --> 00:32:38,000
Learn that for yourself first.

485
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:38,840
You can't even walk

486
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:40,400
out the door like this.

487
00:32:51,400 --> 00:32:53,560
We have done a complete evaluation of this project.

488
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,040
The performance of the first season of Dream of the South...

489
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,560
Aren't you going back to the company?

490
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,680
You're not gonna get anything

491
00:33:00,680 --> 00:33:02,320
out of this little project.

492
00:33:06,120 --> 00:33:07,120
No matter how small it is,

493
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:08,920
it's my own business.

494
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:10,480
I see what you mean.

495
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,720
I never invest

496
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:14,840
because the subject is too small.

497
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:18,840
But I'm thinking about investing in your studio.

498
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:23,320
How do you invest?

499
00:33:23,640 --> 00:33:25,960
I asked Zhang to investigate your studio.

500
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,360
There's no problem with the structure.

501
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,640
The staffing and past performance

502
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:31,640
are also OK.

503
00:33:36,360 --> 00:33:37,240
But,

504
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:39,960
your current valuation is only 7 million yuan.

505
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:41,240
To be honest,

506
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:44,200
this small sum of money

507
00:33:44,200 --> 00:33:45,160
won't satisfy me.

508
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,000
As long as you can

509
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,480
double the valuation in a month,

510
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:50,960
I'll give you 20 million

511
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,080
and I own 40% of the shares.

512
00:33:53,760 --> 00:33:54,800
If you can't make it,

513
00:33:55,520 --> 00:33:57,400
I have the right to buy your studio.

514
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:01,920
You wouldn't be interested in my studio.

515
00:34:02,280 --> 00:34:04,120
So I'll fire everyone

516
00:34:04,120 --> 00:34:05,160
and disband the company.

517
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,640
And you have to get your ass back.

518
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,280
Do what you need to do.

519
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:13,639
The studio doesn't belong to me alone.

520
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:20,120
No one else would value your little studio

521
00:34:20,440 --> 00:34:21,639
that high.

522
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:27,840
I need to talk to my partners.

523
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:30,280
As you saw when you got here,

524
00:34:31,440 --> 00:34:33,639
it's my anniversary party.

525
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,960
Do you want my blessing?

526
00:34:39,920 --> 00:34:41,040
I set a place for you.

527
00:34:42,239 --> 00:34:44,920
Sorry, I have plans today.

I assume that's

530
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:06,120
why you called me here today.

531
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,600
I think it's time for us to show up as a family.

532
00:35:13,120 --> 00:35:14,240
Otherwise, no one will remember

533

I have a son.

Fifteen years have passed,

536
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:41,840
life also has many hardships and difficulties, of course.

537
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,960
Fortunately, I have Lao Bai.

538
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,600
There's a good saying,

539
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:51,880
the company is the longest love confession.

540
00:35:53,480 --> 00:35:55,800
Lao Bai, thank you.

It's rare for us to get together.

Yes.

You're really a winner.

Yes. You see.

557
00:36:58,520 --> 00:37:00,600
I've been thinking about playing with Mr. Bai for a long time.

558
00:37:00,600 --> 00:37:01,800
But he stands too high.

559

I've been working for so many years.

It's not easy to have this chance now.

Right?

562
00:37:05,960 --> 00:37:07,040
Thanks. Thank you.

563
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:10,360
It's nothing. I also count on Mr. Lou's connections.

564
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:12,760
Otherwise, it wouldn't be so easy

I'm flattered.

No. That's not the case.

568
00:37:16,720 --> 00:37:18,640
Anyway, Mr. Bai.

569
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:21,400
You hide your son so well.

If I had such a good son,

571
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:23,760
I would do nothing

Mr. Wang, you don't understand.

Our Lao Bai just wants our son

578
00:37:40,040 --> 00:37:41,120
But Mr. Lou,

579
00:37:41,560 --> 00:37:44,040
we should keep in touch more often in the future.

580

If there's any project, we can work on together.

Right?

582

No problem.

Excuse me.

Sorry. Sorry.

I'm really sorry.

605

What's wrong with you?

606

for having a better half.

608

She also takes care of the house perfectly.

So lucky!

613
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,240

You might as well take care of Ms. Zeng.

OK.

627

628
00:39:51,640 --> 00:39:52,720
I'll go see you tomorrow afternoon.

629
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:54,800
OK.

630
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:56,200
Then we'll

631
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:57,320
talk more about the specifics.

632
00:39:57,320 --> 00:39:58,280
OK?

633
00:39:59,040 --> 00:40:00,840
The operation scheme...

634
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:33,440
It's not easy to

635
00:40:34,040 --> 00:40:35,600
play a sophisticated lady with good taste.

636
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:40,800
What time is it?

637
00:40:42,760 --> 00:40:44,520
I'm so hungry.

638
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,160
Maybe I have some cookies?

639
00:40:56,320 --> 00:40:57,240
No. No.

640
00:40:57,960 --> 00:40:59,920
I'm gonna go get some food later.

641

But it's been so long.

642
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:06,520

00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:09,320
Is he standing me up?
