109
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,160

117
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:47,600
In my opinion,

118
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,040
if Master promotes Beijing Opera

119
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,480
through my status of Internet influencer,

120
00:06:50,480 --> 00:06:51,560
that will be great.

121
00:06:51,560 --> 00:06:52,640
Why always act in an old-fashioned way?

122
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,920
Just look at the Shan.

123
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,960
What's wrong with the Shandengting troupe?

124
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:00,880
Nothing.

125
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:01,960
It's fine.

126
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:04,280
I'm just afraid

127
00:07:04,600 --> 00:07:05,880
you'll feel sad

128
00:07:05,880 --> 00:07:06,920
for those three words

129
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,040
the Shandengting troupe.

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:10,760
By the way,

131
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:12,840
you really get the power now.

132
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,720
You just said something in front of the screen

133
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:16,960
and attracted so many people.

134
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:18,080
That's for sure.

135
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,840
Thank god I didn't listen to you.

136
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,280
It was so tiring to steal my phone back

137
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,120
after you confiscated it every night.

138
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:24,880
Come on,

139
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,640
if I really wanted to confiscate it,

140
00:07:26,640 --> 00:07:27,920
you wouldn't succeed in stealing.

141
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:30,160
Fine, you are right.

142
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:33,360
Anyway,

143
00:07:33,560 --> 00:07:34,480
thank you.

144
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:36,760
Of course,

145
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,400
I didn't work for free.

146
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:39,880
Ten spicy chicken wings.

147
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,400
As usual, not one less.

148
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:45,080
Three.

149
00:07:45,720 --> 00:07:47,800
Eight and I won't take less.

150
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,960
No, at most five.

151
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:51,720
If you eat in this way every day,

152
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,400
within two years,

153
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,600
you can't even turn a somersault.

154
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:55,040
I can.

155
00:07:55,040 --> 00:07:56,360
Of course I can.

156
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:58,680
My god, after the live show,

157
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:00,080
my business is so good.

158
00:08:00,760 --> 00:08:02,800
And how old

159
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,480
are you two?

160
00:08:04,480 --> 00:08:05,920
You are still like what you were in school,

161
00:08:05,920 --> 00:08:07,440
using chicken wing as currency unit.

162
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,920
As the old saying goes, let there be daily renovation.

163
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,560
We should keep pace with the times.

164
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:14,320
Why not use milk tea as currency unit?

165
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:16,680
You are old friends of the Shandengting troupe,

166
00:08:16,680 --> 00:08:18,400

Wait.

172
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:25,480
Bye, sister.

173
00:08:25,480 --> 00:08:26,120
Byebye, byebye.

175

00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,560
I won't kick you out.

178
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,559
-20% discount. 
 -Byebye.

179
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:36,400
I forgot my milk tea.

180
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:38,840
Where's our friendship?

181
00:08:39,240 --> 00:08:40,760
The ship of our long-time friendship

182
00:08:40,760 --> 00:08:41,679
really sinks easily.

183
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:43,919
You left something again

184
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,080
and are always so forgetful.

185
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:46,120
Get your stuff back by yourself.

186
00:08:56,560 --> 00:08:58,600
Hello, welcome to Daydream Space.

187
00:08:58,600 --> 00:09:00,120
For books or for milk tea?

188
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:00,800
For someone.

189
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:01,960
For someone?

190
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,160
Are you the man at that day?

191
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,280
Yes.

192
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,200
The man who was trapped here the whole night

193
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,240
and rescued by you.

194
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,920
So you are looking for?

195
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:12,760
A woman.

196
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,800
A woman?

197
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:16,000
A young woman,

198
00:09:16,760 --> 00:09:18,920
neither tall nor short, neither fat nor thin,

199
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,040
nothing special about the eyes and the nose,

200
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:22,400
but with a bad temper.

201
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,240
You've made it very clear.

202
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:28,320
Why don't you draw her?

203
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:30,400
And I can keep an eye for you.

204
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,280
Have one milk tea and take your time.

205
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,160
I officially announce that

206
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,840
you are invited to play the role of Liu Xichan in South Song.

207
00:09:58,240 --> 00:09:59,480
Who wouldn't announce that?

208
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:00,840
I announce that

209
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,640
I refuse your announcement.

210
00:10:04,280 --> 00:10:06,520
Do you know what osmanthus means?

211
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:08,040
It means

212
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:10,040
being accompanied by your beloved.

213
00:10:11,760 --> 00:10:13,800
Perhaps it only needs a look.

214
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:16,200
It only needs a look,

215
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:18,760
and since then

216
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:22,080
the love for each other has started.

217
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:47,000
The long night

218
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:48,720
is so boring.

219
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,600
How about

220
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:53,120
going for a drink with Sun?

221
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:55,240
Since he sprained his neck

222
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,240
when skiing with us last time,

223
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:58,320
his daughter doesn't allow him to play with us.

224
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,760
Isn't it normal

225
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:01,320
to sprain the neck when skiing?

226
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:03,120
Of course it's normal,

227
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:05,600
but they think we are abnormal.

228
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:07,280
Some people

229
00:11:07,280 --> 00:11:07,920
once told me that

230
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:09,200
elderly women

231
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,480
have few friends to play with.

232
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:11,480
I didn't believe it.

233
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:13,240
It now seems

234
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:14,480
to be a truth.

235
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:16,920
Shan, look.

236
00:11:16,920 --> 00:11:18,320
What is going on there? It's so busy.

237
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:19,600
Let's go and see.

238
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:06,680
What is all this about?

239
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:09,920
Where did you find these people?

240
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:11,880
How much can we get

241
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,960
from these old men and women?

242
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:15,800
What can we sell them?

243
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,240
Sell them wolfberry tea

244
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:19,120
of 1982?

245
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,440
It's Beijing Opera Night.

246
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:22,440
Look at it.

247
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,520
Look at your stupid idea.

248
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,600
You can really drive me mad.

249
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,200
You have to

250
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:30,400
be more clever next time.

251
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:36,880
At least we have more guests now.

252
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:38,640
It's much better than no one here.

253
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,040
Excuse me,

254
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:41,920
would you please tidy the table

255
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:45,040
and bring me some beers?

256
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:46,280
They should get out

257
00:12:46,280 --> 00:12:48,160
to visit more and experience more.

258
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:50,440
Welcome to our X Club's

259
00:12:50,440 --> 00:12:51,920
Beijing Opera Night.

260
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:54,760
Tonight, we have a special guest.

261
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,440
Let's welcome her.

262
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:06,440
It's a girl, a girl.

263
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:16,900
[You and I have a deep bond.]

264
00:13:17,490 --> 00:13:19,950
[Why you're afraid to say wrong?]

265
00:13:20,150 --> 00:13:22,310
[If one day I can relieve my stress.]

266
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:22,040
Confession.

267
00:13:23,030 --> 00:13:25,390
[I swear not to forget your favor, my princess.]

268
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:24,320
Confession, Confession.

269
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,920
She sings better than your favorite

270
00:13:25,940 --> 00:13:28,310
[Don't say favor between you and me.]

271
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:27,480
Emperor Zhengde.

272
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:29,960
It's rare to sing so well for a young girl.

273
00:13:28,860 --> 00:13:31,150
[We're far apart but love is the key.]

274
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,400
[For what reason you looks so gloomy.]

275
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:38,700
[Whatever happens, you can confide in me.]

276
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:38,480
Hooray!

277
00:13:39,080 --> 00:13:41,630
[I didn't meant to put on a gloomy face.]

278
00:13:42,410 --> 00:13:44,130
[There's one thing I hesitate to say.]

279
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:47,010
[Generals get into position. Two states fight.]

280
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,670
[Mother carries provisions to the north side.]

281
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:52,820
[I intend to see her in Song camp.]

282
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:56,100
[How eager to pass the barrier but I can't.]

283
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,040
Guys, are you ready?

284
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:01,200
Does anyone want to sing with me?

285
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:01,760
Yes.

286
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:03,160
I want.

287
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,080
This way, this way.

288
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,120
Here!

289
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:08,880
Here!

290
00:14:09,030 --> 00:14:10,310
[Though you don't stand in my way.]

291
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:12,800
[Without a token how can I pass the gate?]

292
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:14,950
[I can't give you the golden arrow.]

293
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,560
[For fear you never come back anymore.]

294
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,800
[If you give me the golden arrow.]

295
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:22,420
[I'll meet her and turn back in any case.]

296
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,570
[But Song camp is far away.]

297
00:14:24,990 --> 00:14:27,180
[How can you be back in one night?]

298
00:14:27,670 --> 00:14:29,070
[Though Song camp is far away.]

299
00:14:29,670 --> 00:14:31,830
[I'll return at full speed in one night.]

300
00:14:32,470 --> 00:14:33,880
[You swore not to forget me.]

301
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,480
[Now swear your loyalty by the sky.]

302
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:46,400
Wonderful!

303
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,120
Half a dozen Remy Martin.

304
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,280
If we can't finish it today, then continue on tomorrow.

305
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:51,800
No, no, no.

306
00:14:51,960 --> 00:14:54,800
It's just kidding. She's kidding.

307
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,280
Manager, did you hear that?

308
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:57,680
They ordered a drink.

309
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:00,200
What the hell?

310
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,400
They ordered and hurry to serve them.

311
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,840
Wang, what are you waiting for?

312
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:10,160
Wang Zhongqiang?

313
00:15:12,400 --> 00:15:14,760
Fine, I'll go.

314
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:16,280
Let me take your money.

315
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:25,480
Where is Yanhui, my Yanhui?

316
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:26,680
Oh, I need to find Yanhui.

317
00:15:26,680 --> 00:15:27,960
I'm gonna have a drink with her.

318
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:30,400
Your bag.

319
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,480
What's wrong?

320
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:33,640
What's wrong with you?

321
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:36,280
Just go for your Yanhui.

322
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:39,360
Shan.

323
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,320
Can you see that bag?

324
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:42,480
Which bag?

325
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,120
It belonged to the person

326
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,600
who took a leap out of our house that morning.

327
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:49,240
The most attractive Beijing Opera Night...

328
00:15:49,240 --> 00:15:49,960
Now,

329
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:52,080
let's review our slogan,

330
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,000
shall we?

331
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,240
Shan,

332
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:55,240
go and run after it.

333
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:56,680
Oh, come on.

334
00:15:57,560 --> 00:15:58,480
Taking care your waist.

335
00:15:58,480 --> 00:15:59,200
How can you run after it?

336
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,080
And there are so many people.

337
00:16:00,080 --> 00:16:02,240
Beijing Opera is forever young.

338
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:04,840
With passion forever going on.

339
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:17,800
Wang Zhongqiang.

340
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:20,400
Yu Fei.

341
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,080
You were so cool on the stage.

342
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:25,440
You didn't truly know me until we've known each other for 18 years.

343
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,640
Pardon.

344
00:16:27,640 --> 00:16:28,600
I said,

345
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:32,120
it's because we are lifelong friends.

346
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:44,880
Thank you.

347
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:46,040
Thanks.

348
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:50,440
Does it still taste good?

349
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:52,280
Eat slowly. It's so hot.

350
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:53,560
Yes, very good.

351
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,760
Are you going to the bank?

352
00:16:56,760 --> 00:16:57,520
I will go with you.

353
00:16:58,120 --> 00:16:58,880
No, I can manage it.

354
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:00,880
I don't put money in cookie boxes anymore.

355
00:17:01,960 --> 00:17:03,080
You go back for the praise.

356
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:05,400
I mean really.

357
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:07,920
The theme of Beijing Opera Night is excellent.

358
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:08,920
How did you ever think of that?

359
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,400
I have no other strong point.

360
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:15,200
After all,

361
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,240
someone told me that

362
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:17,640
you should stick to your dream,

363
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:20,200
and do it insanely well.

364
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:26,640
You seem

365
00:17:27,319 --> 00:17:28,359
to have changed.

366
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:30,200
Certainly,

367
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,280
you owe me a favor now.

368
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,000
By the way,

369
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,400
with the sales last night,

370
00:17:36,560 --> 00:17:38,640
you can deal with the assessment,

371
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:39,640
can't you?

372
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:40,400
Are you caring about me?

373
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,040
For Shandengting troupe,

374
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,600
there's nothing that can't be fixed.

375
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:54,320
Do you pass it?

376
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:02,600
Yes.

377
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:04,640
You lie to me.

378
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,200
You did it!

379
00:18:08,360 --> 00:18:09,840
You must treat me to a meal.

380
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:10,880
No problem.

381
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,880
Keep your voice down, you little fool.

382
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:14,120
Let's go.

383
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:18,320
You,

384
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:20,040
you are really getting older.

385
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,720
How could you sprain your waist by dancing?

386
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,280
So what?

387
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:26,240
It's not the first time.

388
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:27,280
Don't be stubborn.

389
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,040
You need to see the Doctor Yu.

390
00:18:29,040 --> 00:18:30,680
No, I don't need him.

391
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:32,400
Just go.

392
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:35,600
You've already got up.

393
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:37,000
So early today.

394
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,120
We dance tonight,

395
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:40,600
and will come back later.

396
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:42,160
We don't have the key with us,

397
00:18:42,680 --> 00:18:44,760
so don't sleep early,

398
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:46,440
and remember to open the door.

399
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:47,840
Were you

400
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:49,400
waiting for us

401
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,960
all night?

402
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:54,480
It's 7 o'clock now. What do you think?

403
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,880
Right.

404
00:18:55,880 --> 00:18:57,320
Too late, we stayed out too late.

405
00:18:57,320 --> 00:18:59,000
He sprained his twist.

406
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,960
You gain vigor with age and live in a punk life.

407
00:19:01,960 --> 00:19:03,400
Fine by me.

408
00:19:03,680 --> 00:19:05,720
But please don't torture me.

409
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:07,560
He tortured me.

410
00:19:07,880 --> 00:19:09,120
He can't hold his drink.

411
00:19:09,120 --> 00:19:11,080
A tumbler of XO and he was under the table.

412
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,200
It made me lose my interest.

413
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:14,000
Shan,

414
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,680
it was not just a tumbler of XO.

415
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:19,240
Dao also sent us three bottles of shooter.

416
00:19:19,240 --> 00:19:20,240
Is shooter a kind of alcohol?

417
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:20,960
Of, of course.

418
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,520
When you were young, you claimed you could

419
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:23,440
drink as much as Li Bai.

420
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:23,920
That's true.

421
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:24,920
You lied to me.

422
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,520
Lie, lie.

423
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,760
Yeah, I lied.

424
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,760
I lied to you and you

425
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,840
were willing to be with me.

426
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:33,080
I thought I should have taken you last night.

427
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,480
A girl sang with me in the Club.

428
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,080
She must be your cup of tea, I think.

429
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:38,960
You must

430
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:39,960
be regretful not going with us.

431
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:41,560
I don't need it.

432
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:48,000
Fried dough sticks, sesame rice balls,

433
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:50,160
egg pancakes, rice rolls, steamed...

434
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:50,800
buns.

435
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:57,880
Come over here.

436
00:19:58,640 --> 00:19:59,360
It was him

437
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:00,560
who came up with the idea.

438
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:02,280
Indeed,

439
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:03,600
as his leader,

440
00:20:03,800 --> 00:20:04,840
I should also make a self-criticism.

441
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:08,240
It did hit a record high last night,

442
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:10,640
but the old guys

443
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:12,800
are not our target customers at all.

444
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,800
Besides,

445
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:15,280
the opera

446
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:17,000
does not conform with

447
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,800
our consistently cool and fashion style.

448
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:20,960
I watched the event yesterday

449
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:22,920
which was indeed hasty.

450
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,240
Please be at ease.

451
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:25,200
I know the rules.

452
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,600
I'm firing him right now.

453
00:20:26,600 --> 00:20:28,400
You, pick up your stuffs and leave.

454
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:31,040
If we follow the rules,

455
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:33,920
you let my employee get bullied

456
00:20:33,920 --> 00:20:34,960
and then how to deal with you?

457
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:39,800
Boss,

458
00:20:39,920 --> 00:20:40,840
but...

459
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:42,920
Wei sir is, is...

460
00:20:43,040 --> 00:20:44,280
Tian's son.

461
00:20:44,520 --> 00:20:45,920
Liu's son-in-law.

462
00:20:46,280 --> 00:20:47,200
So what?

463
00:20:47,840 --> 00:20:49,760
Whoever comes into X Club

464
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:51,680
must follow our rules.

465
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,200
Though we work in the service industry,

466
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:56,840
we have employees working here

467
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,080
to create values for the company,

468
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:01,480
not to get bullied,

469
00:21:01,480 --> 00:21:03,040
or suffer from bad tempers.

470
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,280
As for Tian's son made mistakes,

471
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:07,280
I certainly should educate him

472
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:08,440
on behalf of Tian.

473
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:10,600
As for our business is affected,

474
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,360
Tian will see what he can do.

475
00:21:14,320 --> 00:21:15,880
Can you tell me your name?

476
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:17,480
Dao.

477
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:19,240
How did you

478
00:21:19,240 --> 00:21:20,440
think of the theme?

479
00:21:21,400 --> 00:21:22,400
One of my friends

480
00:21:22,400 --> 00:21:23,840
has been practicing Beijing Opera since a young age.

481
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,400
You have a lot of friends.

482
00:21:27,080 --> 00:21:28,000
In this industry,

483
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,040
friends can help a lot.

484
00:21:29,800 --> 00:21:31,800
I watched the video of yesterday's event.

485
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,320
You are full of ideas,

486
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,400
but the whole project

487
00:21:35,400 --> 00:21:36,760
was not mature enough.

488
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:37,960
See,

489
00:21:38,120 --> 00:21:39,960
guests over 60

490
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,840
entered a closed space,

491
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:43,960
but did we prepare in advance

492
00:21:43,960 --> 00:21:44,880
any AEDs?

493
00:21:45,480 --> 00:21:46,560
In the front of stage,

494
00:21:46,920 --> 00:21:48,160
we had Acrobatic Male turn a somersault,

495
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:48,960
but did we

496
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:50,680
lay safety mat on the stage

497
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:53,240
and safety net under the stage?

498
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,320
We need take these into consideration.

499
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,840
Do you want to get promotion to the next level?

500
00:22:03,160 --> 00:22:04,040
In a month,

501
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:05,280
millions in profits.

502
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,040
Do you have any confidence?

503
00:22:10,160 --> 00:22:11,240
Yes.

504
00:22:45,240 --> 00:22:49,130
# [Yu' TCM Clinic]

505
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:49,480
Yu Qing.

506
00:22:50,760 --> 00:22:52,280
Open the door.

507
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,560
Yu Qing.

508
00:22:55,920 --> 00:22:58,200
Yu Qing, open the door.

509
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,000
Yu Qing.

510
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,480
Let him out.

511
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,960
Take the money and get out of here.

512
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
Let him out, Yu Qing.

513
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:10,240
-What are you doing? 
 -Quick.

514
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:11,720
What are you doing?

515
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:13,000
You!

516
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,200
-Yu Qing. 
 -He doesn't want to see you.

517
00:23:16,720 --> 00:23:18,240
This is your daughter.

518
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:20,280
She is 12 this year.

519
00:23:21,000 --> 00:23:22,200
Her name is Yu Fei.

520
00:23:23,240 --> 00:23:25,080
I never wanted her to see you,

521
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:27,280
never wanted you to know her.

522
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:31,140
[Bring the dying back to life]

523
00:23:28,520 --> 00:23:30,680
But she is sick and dying.

524
00:23:32,000 --> 00:23:33,640
You know all those people at the hospital.

525
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:35,120
You must have a way.

526
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:38,880
I, Yan Peishan, have never begged anyone in my life.

527
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:41,040
If we were not desperate,

528
00:23:41,040 --> 00:23:42,920
I certainly wouldn't be asking you.

529
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:46,080
You are a doctor too.

530
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,440
Even if she's not your daughter,

531
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:49,720
she's also a life.

532
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:53,040
How can you bear to watch her die?

533
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:54,840
Mom.

534
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,680
Come on, beg your father.

535
00:24:11,280 --> 00:24:12,520
Do you figure it out?

536
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:15,480
Whatever it takes,

537
00:24:17,480 --> 00:24:18,720
I should take care of her.

538
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:28,760
What about us?

539
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:31,200
I am...

540
00:24:32,480 --> 00:24:34,120
I am sorry for you.

541
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,200
I will go.

542
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:46,600
All the stuff here

543
00:24:51,160 --> 00:24:53,040
are yours.

544
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,040
Then I fell down.

545
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,200
All right.

546
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,320
Have some water.

547
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:28,160
Time for dinner.

548
00:25:34,520 --> 00:25:35,640
What are you doing here?

549
00:25:42,720 --> 00:25:44,200
I come to pay this month's money.

550
00:25:44,920 --> 00:25:46,520
I told you.

551
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,440
I don't need your money.

552
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,520
I'm leaving.

553
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:53,920
Don't you see me, do you?

554
00:25:58,000 --> 00:25:59,600
Ms. Qin, haven't seen you for a long time.

555
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:00,960
Long time?

556
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:03,200
We just met the other day

557
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,920
when your mother died.

558
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,640
Maybe I didn't make it clear last time.

559
00:26:09,640 --> 00:26:11,560
I must say it again.

560
00:26:12,120 --> 00:26:13,400
You can talk about me,

561
00:26:14,360 --> 00:26:15,400
but don't mention my mom.

562
00:26:16,160 --> 00:26:16,920
All right, all right.

563
00:26:17,240 --> 00:26:18,320
No arguing, okay.

564
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:19,640
No arguing.

565
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:21,760
Why not sit down,

566
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,800
and have dinner together?

567
00:26:32,040 --> 00:26:33,920
If I knew you have a filial daughter,

568
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:36,080
why should I bring you dishes?

569
00:26:49,400 --> 00:26:50,520
I'll do it.

570
00:26:59,280 --> 00:27:01,480
Can you move a little faster?

571
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:02,640
We are almost there.

572
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:04,120
You said before

573
00:27:04,120 --> 00:27:05,440
your neck doesn't feel well,

574
00:27:05,440 --> 00:27:06,720
so why not ask Doctor Yu to have a check?

575
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:08,680
Shan Lao, I'm really busy.

576
00:27:08,840 --> 00:27:10,120
You are such a young man.

577
00:27:10,120 --> 00:27:11,440
Are you still afraid of the doctor?

578
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:14,520
When he fractured his bones at a young age,

579
00:27:14,520 --> 00:27:16,040
Doctor Yu helped set the fracture.

580
00:27:16,440 --> 00:27:18,200
Doctor Yu is quite a busy person.

581
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:19,080
My waist has just

582
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:20,320
a minor problem.

583
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:22,040
I can recover after lying down for several days.

584
00:27:22,160 --> 00:27:23,760
Don't bother him.

585
00:27:23,840 --> 00:27:25,000
Let's go back.

586
00:27:25,000 --> 00:27:25,760
Stop.

587
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,120
You can't go back before you see the doctor.

588
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:29,760
It's all your fault.

589
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:30,960
When he started being naughty

590
00:27:31,080 --> 00:27:32,360
as a kid, you always threatened him.

591
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:34,440
I'll send you to Doctor Yu.

592
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,400
Look,

593
00:27:35,400 --> 00:27:36,840
what psychological damage you caused.

594
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:39,000
Now you should lead by example.

595
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,320
Lead by example.

596
00:27:43,240 --> 00:27:44,760
And later

597
00:27:44,760 --> 00:27:46,760
when Doctor Yu conducts the bonesetting,

598
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:49,240
I need to hold your little hands.

599
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:51,440
You can hold my little hands right now.

600
00:27:51,910 --> 00:27:53,410
[Timer 40 minutes left.]

601
00:27:53,800 --> 00:27:54,960
Let's get in.

602
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:57,520
I've got to go now.

603
00:27:57,520 --> 00:27:58,400
I'm not going.

604
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:01,200
If you're going to show affection, then get in.

605
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:02,400
I must leave now.

606
00:28:03,080 --> 00:28:04,560
Call me after you finish it.

607
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:05,640
I'll pick you up.

608
00:28:06,640 --> 00:28:08,600
Well, if you do date with your girlfriend,

609
00:28:08,600 --> 00:28:10,160
we don't mind at all.

610
00:28:10,760 --> 00:28:12,480
Shall we follow him and take a look?

611
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:14,000
Look? Look here.

612
00:28:16,160 --> 00:28:17,320
Something smells great.

613
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:28,240
Nothing else in your house.

614
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,320
Just make it.

615
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:33,840
It looks good.

616
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,400
I want it too.

617
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,560
Two, please.

618
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:47,520
Two bowls.

619
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:54,680
Last night,

620
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,320
I did not expect

621
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,600
Yu is your father.

622
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,800
I also did not expect

623
00:29:00,800 --> 00:29:03,360
your noodles are so good.

624
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:05,320
Thank you.

625
00:29:06,040 --> 00:29:07,160
Hello,

626
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,280
did you finish it?

627
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,480
We did, we did.

628
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
What do you want me to do?

629
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:18,080
My waist, broken, after dancing.

630
00:29:18,360 --> 00:29:19,960
So I need your help?

631
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:21,440
Sorry.

632
00:29:21,880 --> 00:29:22,800
I'm afraid that I can not help.

633
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,760
That's all right, all right.

634
00:29:25,040 --> 00:29:27,160
He has broken his waist.

635
00:29:27,160 --> 00:29:28,560
I have to take care of him,

636
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:31,400
so I have no time to shop and cook.

637
00:29:32,320 --> 00:29:33,760
Therefore, we hope

638
00:29:33,960 --> 00:29:35,280
you can help us.

639
00:29:35,520 --> 00:29:36,520
I mean,

640
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:38,360
can you...

641
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,600
You've eaten everything

642
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,240
in my house.

643
00:29:41,720 --> 00:29:42,800
There is nothing left.

644
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:44,520
I didn't mean that.

645
00:29:44,520 --> 00:29:46,000
It doesn't matter.

646
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,440
Today,

647
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,880
my grandson took us here

648
00:29:49,880 --> 00:29:52,240
and he left after answering the phone at the door.

649
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:53,720
We fail to

650
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:55,040
receive the treatment

651
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,400
and are still starving.

652
00:29:57,240 --> 00:29:59,440
Since we're here, we're your guests.

653
00:29:59,720 --> 00:30:01,520
Do you think you should ask someone

654
00:30:01,680 --> 00:30:02,920
to send your guests

655
00:30:03,280 --> 00:30:04,760
back home?

656
00:30:07,880 --> 00:30:09,360
You can ask another one.

657
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,520
I think she is a suitable person.

658
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:14,080
I agree with her.

659
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,160
Me.

660
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:16,720
Yes.

661
00:30:20,520 --> 00:30:23,000
You sang so well last night.

662
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:24,680
Did you start learning since a young age?

663
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,120
No wonder.

664
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:28,560
What a great strength!

665
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:31,280
Watch the steps.

666
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,280
Here we are.

667
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:40,960
Since you're home,

668
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,040
you two just go in.

669
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:45,400
I have something to do.

670
00:30:45,640 --> 00:30:47,040
Well, I'm just gonna go.

671
00:30:47,880 --> 00:30:49,360
Look, look.

672
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:51,400
You have to help him get into the house.

673
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,560
Hold his arm.

674
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:55,040
Tell you the truth.

675
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,520
Shang has sprained his waist

676
00:30:56,520 --> 00:30:58,040
and I will be busy in housework.

677
00:30:58,040 --> 00:31:00,800
If you're not busy,

678
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:02,080
can you come here

679
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:03,520
and make some meals for him.

680
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:06,480
No, I can only make some home-cooked meals.

681
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,840
It's embarrassing to take it out.

682
00:31:08,120 --> 00:31:11,440
Home cooking, I love home cooking.

683
00:31:11,640 --> 00:31:13,040
Besides,

684
00:31:13,160 --> 00:31:15,520
your father and I have been friends for years.

685
00:31:15,520 --> 00:31:17,400
You must help me this time.

686
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:18,640
You need to help.

687
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,480
Come in, come in, open the door.

688
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,320
Come in and take a seat.

689
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:24,880
Have some tea.

690
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:26,280
Xiao Bai.

691
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:49,560
Are you okay?

692
00:32:00,480 --> 00:32:01,840
Are you okay? Do you hurt?

693
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,320
Get up, get up.

694
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,320
Are you alright?

695
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:08,000
Waist, my waist.

696
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:08,680
Are you all right?

697
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,440
You...

698
00:32:09,640 --> 00:32:10,840
Do you hurt?

699
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,200
No password?

700
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:18,440
What are you doing with my phone?

701
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,200
What are you doing with my phone?

702
00:32:22,080 --> 00:32:23,040
Xiao Bai.

703
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:25,200
She comes to help us make meals.

704
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:29,600
Be gentleman.

705
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:33,040
-In that case. 
 -Give me!

706
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:34,600
Find my phone.

707
00:32:34,880 --> 00:32:35,960
Turn on it.

708
00:32:36,800 --> 00:32:38,160
Then it's more convenient

709
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,000
to look for food

710
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,720
and look for you.

711
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,000
Are you

712
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:46,600
insane!

713
00:32:47,320 --> 00:32:48,560
Give me back.

714
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:55,840
Vegetables and fruits are delivered twice a week.

715
00:32:56,880 --> 00:32:58,960
I didn't promise to cook for you.

716
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:00,320
Give my phone back to me.

717
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,760
I can give it back to you,

718
00:33:02,480 --> 00:33:04,360
but you can't block me on Wechat.

719
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:07,040
OK.

720
00:33:08,520 --> 00:33:10,880
A word spoken cannot be recalled.

721
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,320
Let me introduce for you.

722
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:16,760
I didn't know

723
00:33:16,760 --> 00:33:18,400
you are a family.

724
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,400
These are the spices.

725
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:22,720
We have light meals,

726
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:24,000
less oil and less salt.

727
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:25,920
Salt tofu pudding, scrambled egg with tomato and Zongzi with meat

728
00:33:25,920 --> 00:33:27,160
should be sugar free.

729
00:33:27,160 --> 00:33:30,560
We don't have garlic, ginger, shallots

730
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:31,960
and egg yolks.

731
00:33:32,160 --> 00:33:33,200
Microwave oven,

732
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:34,720
food processer, waste processor

733
00:33:34,720 --> 00:33:37,240
and cooker hood have no instructions.

734
00:33:37,680 --> 00:33:38,720
By the way,

735
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,360
if you know where my room is,

736
00:33:43,800 --> 00:33:45,360
you can come and ask me.

737
00:33:46,080 --> 00:33:47,360
I won't.

738
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,360
It seems you have known

739
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:53,880
how to use the cooker hood.

740
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,280
It's good.

741
00:33:55,680 --> 00:33:56,840
I'll send the menu to you.

742
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
You've known each other.

743
00:33:58,600 --> 00:34:00,000
You seem to be familiar with each other.

744
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:00,920
No.

745
00:34:02,360 --> 00:34:03,280
No.

746
00:34:04,200 --> 00:34:06,360
Never mind, never mind.

747
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:08,520
We don't mind it at all.

748
00:34:17,960 --> 00:34:19,320
Grooming.

749
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,560
Half an hour.

750
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,520
Cooking.

751
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:26,960
An hour and a half.

752
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Round trip.

753
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,120
Two hours.

754
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:36,520
That's 25 hours and 15 minutes.

755
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:40,840
Sleeping

756
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,400
6 hours and 45 minutes, okay.

757
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,520
In this way,

758
00:34:45,639 --> 00:34:47,360
I'll have time to learn English.

759
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,840
Where's my English notebook?

760
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:57,600
7 o'clock tomorrow...

761
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,520
Forget it.

762
00:35:02,680 --> 00:35:05,160
This week's menu...

763
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:20,840
Is this your notebook?

764
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,280
Good night.

765
00:35:29,560 --> 00:35:30,760
Task completed.

766
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:32,080
Praise you.

767
00:35:33,560 --> 00:35:35,000
One, two, three.

768
00:35:35,640 --> 00:35:38,030
[Manage to get them to meet]
[Ask her to cook meals and make them meet]
[Make them befriend on Wechat]

769
00:35:35,840 --> 00:35:37,080
Let me see.

770
00:35:37,080 --> 00:35:38,320
Our plan

771
00:35:38,030 --> 00:35:41,500
[Sound out Xiao Bai's mind ]
[Give Xiao Bai her notebook left at home.]

772
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,680
seems almost finished.

773
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:42,280
Are you sure

774
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:43,200
she is the girl

775
00:35:43,200 --> 00:35:44,960
we saw that morning?

776
00:35:45,960 --> 00:35:48,120
Did you notice their expression

777
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,160
when they were talking?

778
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:51,360
They were playing hard to get.

779
00:35:53,120 --> 00:35:54,360
I can't talk to you,

780
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,480
a liberal arts student

781
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,760
without observational ability.

782
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:58,880
Unlike me,

783
00:35:59,160 --> 00:36:00,560
I can see the bacteria clearly

784
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:01,960
in the lab.

785
00:36:01,960 --> 00:36:03,440
I can't be wrong about that.

786
00:36:03,440 --> 00:36:05,040
And I was never wrong before.

787
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:07,200
For example, I found the right person,

788
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:08,000
right?

789
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,120
Anyway, we have to help Xiao Bai

790
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:10,680
to find his true love.

791
00:36:10,680 --> 00:36:11,760
It's a good idea.

792
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,640
This isn't my notebook.

793
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:27,280
I got it back from Shuji.

794
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:29,600
Why does it disappear again?

795
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:33,040
Why do I lose it so many times?

796
00:36:33,280 --> 00:36:35,440
Come on, Yu.

797
00:36:35,640 --> 00:36:37,360
With 200 more words,

798
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,760
you can have dinner.

799
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:42,960
I choose to starve.

800
00:36:44,440 --> 00:36:46,760
I'm not human if I fail to finish today.

801
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:49,120
What kind of devil is English!

802
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,840
I'd rather do 100 somersaults.

803
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:04,160
There is a page ripped out.

804
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:08,320
This notebook

805
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,480
may be...

806
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,280
Why don't we draw her?

807
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:15,880
And I can keep an eye for you.

808
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:25,000
What a coincidence!

809
00:37:29,160 --> 00:37:31,360
I was so smart to have the foresight.

810
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:39,120
It seems you are the only one left.

811
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:41,640
Shuji,

812
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:43,560
did you see my notebook?

813
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:44,760
Over there.

814
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,160
And someone has left you a message.

815
00:37:47,320 --> 00:37:48,200
-Have a look. 
 -Message?

816
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,400
In the middle.

817
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:05,560
This page...

818
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,480
Do you have my notebook?

819
00:38:18,320 --> 00:38:20,000
I have your notebook.

820
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,760
Be here on time tomorrow night,

821
00:38:21,960 --> 00:38:23,000
or I'll tear it up.

822
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:27,760
I never take threats.

823
00:38:31,960 --> 00:38:32,960
Neither do I.

824
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:43,480
Are you sure?

825
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,520
Did you lose

826
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:56,120
your notebook

827
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:57,720
before?

828
00:39:00,520 --> 00:39:01,360
No.

829
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:03,280
It will give me away.

830
00:39:07,640 --> 00:39:09,200
I won't move before the enemy does.

831
00:39:09,920 --> 00:39:11,080
Maybe

832
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,760
she didn't rip that page out.

833
00:39:14,880 --> 00:39:17,160
Don't fret and stumble.

834
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,120
That's it.

835
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:24,800
First, how to pay your ransom?

836
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,520
You can pay it through labor.

837
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:28,440
Cook dinner every day

838
00:39:28,440 --> 00:39:30,480
plus occasional lunches.

839
00:39:31,120 --> 00:39:33,600
It's hard to remember English words in that way, isn't it?

840
00:39:34,840 --> 00:39:36,400
Why should I pay the ransom?

841
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,400
I warn you

842
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,880
not to peek at my diary.

843
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,360
What if

844
00:39:43,360 --> 00:39:45,160
you see something you shouldn't?

845
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,160
Did she see it or not?

846
00:39:56,680 --> 00:39:57,560
No.

847
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,760
I must finish 30 pages today.

848
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:06,560
I can't understand it at all.

849
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,000
English is too difficult.

850
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:13,960
Why can't people on earth

851
00:40:13,960 --> 00:40:16,040
speak a single language?

852
00:40:23,280 --> 00:40:24,640
Learn English.

853
00:40:25,040 --> 00:40:26,000
All in sunshine.

854
00:40:26,360 --> 00:40:27,520
Pass the exams in 30 days.

855
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:28,920
Take a direct train to elite universities.

856
00:40:31,480 --> 00:40:33,560
Let's fight the losing battle.

857
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:37,520
Only 500 likes.

858
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,440
Learning methods of black technology for free.

859
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,480
Accelerated English is never a dream.

860
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:44,160
I believe you can fly.

861
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,400
500 likes,

862
00:40:52,320 --> 00:40:53,680
you're my last resort.

863
00:41:09,120 --> 00:41:10,680
Only 500 likes.

864
00:41:10,680 --> 00:41:12,200
