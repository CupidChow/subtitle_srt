Take it. Hurry up.

00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,400
Sorry, I'm late.

6
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:07,200
What happened?

7
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:09,479
You don't know what happened?

8
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,160
What do you mean?

9
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:13,080
I mean what you think I mean.

10
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,760
You think I did all this?

11
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:18,640
Or?

12
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:19,920
The poster.

13
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:20,920
It took us a week

14
00:02:20,920 --> 00:02:22,760
to design and finish the first draft.

15
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:23,800
These props

16
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:25,000
were made by Zhuang Sheng bit by bit.

17
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,400
It took him two months.

18
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:27,640
And that costume.

19
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:29,280
We put out ten drafts of the design.

20
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,680
It took us almost half a year.

21
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,720
It was all our work.

22
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,240
If it wasn't you ,then it was us?

23
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:36,680
Last night, it was just her and the boss here.

24
00:02:36,960 --> 00:02:38,440
If that's not her, then that's our boss?

25
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:39,640
Exactly.

26
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:41,440
It must be her.

27
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,320
Could it be us?

28
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:43,040
Yes.

29
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:46,120
We're about to take the stage.

30
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,200
Rather than spending time reasoning here,

31
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,480
you might as well fix it.

32
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:56,920
Hello, Hao Shi.

33
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:58,840

Cut the crap.

36
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,720
Just wait there. I'll come to you.

37
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,000
What are we going to do? We're next.

38
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:07,960
How's it going?

39
00:03:07,960 --> 00:03:09,840
Is everything done?

40
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,280
That sample dress of Liu Xichan.

41
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,920
I brought it, too.

42
00:03:17,240 --> 00:03:18,880

Jiuye, you look very much alike.

47
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:30,680
Agree. I think it's gonna be great.

48
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:33,120
Yu Fei, this dress is worn out.

49
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,040
How can I fix it?

50
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:36,480
I give you thirty minutes to fix it.

Or else.

52
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,360

I'll have a try.

56

That's not good. I really can't do it.

57
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,960
It's lucky we were prepared.

58
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,640
Jiuye, this time you play Liu Xichan.

59
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,840
But I didn't prepare in advance.

I don't think she should be on the stage.

Yes. We can't let her appear on the stage.

00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,800
Thanks.

176
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,320
Everybody's backstage.

177
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,120
What are you doing here?

178
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:14,080
Thanks.

179
00:12:16,640 --> 00:12:18,040
After this show,

180
00:12:18,040 --> 00:12:18,880
I'm gonna

181
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:20,400
rearrange the South Song.

182
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:23,080
Where did you get the idea this time?

183
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:27,080
But,

184
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:28,640
for Liu Xichan,

185
00:12:28,640 --> 00:12:30,160
we got the right person.

186
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,440
She can play Kunqu and Qinqiang.

187
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,680
And her singing and dancing are excellent.

188
00:12:33,320 --> 00:12:34,560
I have to say

189
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:37,440
I have such good taste in girls.

190
00:12:38,920 --> 00:12:39,840
Fine.

191
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:41,240
That's your merit.

192
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:55,720
Excuse me.

193
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:00,800
Why isn't she answering the phone?

194
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:05,200
Yu Fei, where are you? Just hurry.

195
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:08,400
Doctor, her daughter will be here in a minute.

196
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,520
Hurry up. The patient won't last much longer.

197
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,320
Isn't this Liu Xichan?

198
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:19,120
What a coincidence.

199
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,600
What are you guys doing?

200
00:13:24,280 --> 00:13:26,160
Show some respect to the star of the Comic Con.

201
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,400
We are here to negotiate things.

202
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:30,400
I have nothing to say to you.

203
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,120
Today, you did a very good job.

204
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:35,320
How about this.

205
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,760
We two cooperate.

206
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:38,480
How much does he give you.

207
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:40,640
I'll give you double.

208
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:41,480
Get out of my way.

209
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:42,520
Three times.

210
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:44,920
Even if you give me a mountain of gold,

211
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:46,880
I won't work with you.

212
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,920
Except money,

213
00:13:56,920 --> 00:13:58,920
what else did Bai Feili give you?

214
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:02,320
Oh, I almost forgot your main business.

215
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:04,000
Let's get it straight.

216
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:05,920
Look at these cute boys.

217
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,360
Which one do you like?

218
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:10,040
I'll be direct too.

219
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,920
I will never work with

220
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:14,760
someone as filthy as you.

221
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:17,400
Let me see how noble you are.

222
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,040
If you stop me again,

223
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:25,520
I won't be polite.

224
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:28,240
Are you in such a hurry to be reincarnated

225
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,160
or to the funeral?

226
00:14:33,840 --> 00:14:34,920
Why did you...

227
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:37,840
I'd like to see

228
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:39,840
which of you I mourn today.

229
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:42,080
You had to escalate the conflict.

230
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,320
Everybody!

231
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:10,440
Out of my way!

232
00:15:13,120 --> 00:15:14,920
You force us to do it!

233
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:18,720
You treat a peaceful tiger as a sick cat?

234
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:34,160
Dao Ge.

235
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:35,480
I can't believe you guys

236
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:36,880
bully a little girl.

237
00:15:37,160 --> 00:15:38,320
What do you got?

238
00:15:38,760 --> 00:15:39,560
Kill him!

239
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:52,000
Yu Fei.

240
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:52,880
You go first.

241
00:16:01,320 --> 00:16:02,960
Who asked you to be the hero to rescue the beauty?

242
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,600
There you have it.

243
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,520
There. Chase.

244
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:28,960
Let's go.

245
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:29,720
Are you OK?

246
00:16:31,720 --> 00:16:32,600
Bai Feili.

247
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:33,400
Let's go.

248
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:37,000
Bai Feili.

249
00:16:37,280 --> 00:16:38,280
Bai Feili, open the door.

250
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:40,120
Open the door.

251
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:45,240
Bai Feili.

252
00:16:50,640 --> 00:16:51,360
Let's go.

253
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,680
Stop. Stop.

254
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:02,120
Hurry.

255
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,000
Don't go!

256
00:17:27,920 --> 00:17:28,720
Please sign your name here.

257
00:17:28,720 --> 00:17:29,560
Doctor.

258
00:17:31,160 --> 00:17:32,560
Critical Illness Notice.

259
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,760
You'd better inform other family members to come as soon as possible.

260
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,520
She's almost here.

261
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:51,960
Why are you still bleeding so much?

262
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,280
Look at you. Naive.

263
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:55,520
It's not a big deal.

264
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:56,280
Besides.

265
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:57,440
Get up.

266
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,280
Doctor.

267
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:00,000
I'm OK.

268
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:00,680
Are you OK?

269
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:02,680
Your mom needs you. You should go.

270
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:03,680
No.

271
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:05,720
I'm OK.

272
00:18:07,040 --> 00:18:08,680
Just go. I'm OK.

273
00:18:09,160 --> 00:18:09,880
Go.

274
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:14,240
Be careful.

275
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:22,720
Two hundred and twenty one. Two hundred and twenty two.

276
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,800
Two hundred and twenty three. Two hundred and twenty four.

277
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:25,200
Nurse, prepare one milligram

278
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:26,600
epinephrine. Get ready for static push.

279
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:31,800
Three hundred and six. Three hundred and seven. Three hundred and eight.

280
00:18:31,800 --> 00:18:32,480
Three hundred and nine.

281
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,200
Is her family here?

282
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:45,040
Family, her family will be here soon.

283
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:56,160
Girl.

284
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,120
Girl.

285
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,360
What kind of fish is that?

286
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,040
Girl is the freest fish in the river.

287
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:14,160
It can go to the small pond.

288
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:16,440
It can also go to the stinky river.

289
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,040
No one can catch it.

290
00:19:18,920 --> 00:19:20,200
Is it delicious

291
00:19:20,200 --> 00:19:21,800
or the yellow croaker delicious?

292
00:19:22,560 --> 00:19:24,880
Greedy. You girl!

293
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:49,760
Notify the family of her death.

294
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,240
The time of death,

295
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:52,680
Six thirty in the afternoon.

296
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:04,440
I'm sorry, we did our best.

297
00:20:16,120 --> 00:20:18,600
Come with me to go through the documents.

298
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,480
OK. OK. OK.

299
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:09,440
I've already paid her hospital expenses.

300
00:23:11,880 --> 00:23:13,120
How much is it?

301
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:15,280
I'll pay you back.

302
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:17,520
If I were you,

303
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:21,360
I wouldn't ask for the money

304
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:23,880
when I know I can't pay it back.

305
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:27,000
Do you know why I helped you?

306
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,320
Although she and your father

307
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:33,520
were together before I got married,

308
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,320
she chose to hide it,

309
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:39,160
why would she show up at my happiest time?

310
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:41,560
Now you can't afford the expenses.

311
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:44,080
It's just a disgrace.

312
00:23:44,560 --> 00:23:47,000
No matter how unbearable the way of making money is,

313
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:49,760
it will be forgotten

314
00:23:50,200 --> 00:23:52,160
after a period of time.

315
00:23:53,680 --> 00:23:55,360
But I helped you,

316
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:59,040
you'll be upset for the rest of your life.

317
00:24:04,360 --> 00:24:06,240
She ruined my life.

318
00:24:07,080 --> 00:24:08,200
Now.

319
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,600
Now she's gone.

320
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:16,720
How could I just let it go?

321
00:24:20,680 --> 00:24:22,560
I want you to be like her,

322
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:25,600
so you can't hold your head up for a lifetime.

323
00:24:27,800 --> 00:24:29,280
Do you think

324
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,440
I chose this kind of life?

325
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,800
I grew up without a father.

326
00:24:48,680 --> 00:24:50,560
Now I have no mother.

327
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:53,320
What do you want?

328
00:24:58,040 --> 00:24:59,600
A man without his mom

329
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:02,720
is not afraid of anything.

330
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:45,640
The belonginhs of Yan Peishan in Bed 32.

331
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,800
Take it all out.

332
00:25:47,040 --> 00:25:49,440
Hurry up. We have other things to do.

333
00:25:56,080 --> 00:25:57,400
What happened to Yan Peishan?

334
00:25:58,640 --> 00:26:00,120
She‘s passed away.

335
00:26:01,480 --> 00:26:03,520
You. Are you one of her family?

336
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:10,200
Sir. Help. Someone help!

337
00:26:12,360 --> 00:26:14,240
Sir, please wake up.

338
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,520
Sir.

339
00:26:16,040 --> 00:26:17,160
Are you OK?

340
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:20,320
Have some water.

341
00:26:21,560 --> 00:26:22,600
You go ahead and do your work.

342
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:23,120
OK.

343
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:26,240
If you're OK, then I'll...

344
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,800
Yan Peishan is fifty years old？

345
00:26:30,800 --> 00:26:31,640
Yes.

346
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:34,480
Does she have a daughter

347
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:35,520
named...

348
00:26:35,520 --> 00:26:36,680
I think.

349
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:38,480
Called Yu Fei?

350
00:26:40,280 --> 00:26:41,720
I need to get busy.

351
00:26:41,720 --> 00:26:42,800
Sorry.

352
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:11,000
My dream Jiubai Studio,

353
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,640
I‘m finally coming.

354
00:27:18,080 --> 00:27:18,880
Hello.

355
00:27:25,800 --> 00:27:26,920
Is anybody there?

356
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:29,000
I'm here for an interview today.

357
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:34,040
It's so big!

358
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:37,520
There's such a big bird here.

359
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,560
This must be dove.

360
00:27:39,960 --> 00:27:41,360
Jiubai.

361
00:27:44,240 --> 00:27:45,400
Comic wall.

362
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:56,520
Hello?

363
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:01,160
This must be the props room.

364
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,560
So big.

365
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,080
Why is

366
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,360
nobody here?

367
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,000
Didn't we make an appointment?

368
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:15,920
Bai Feili Mysterious Fainting Incident.

369
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:17,680
A few months ago,

370
00:28:17,680 --> 00:28:20,040
on the night of Suzhou Comic Con,

371
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:21,280
Bai Feili

372
00:28:21,480 --> 00:28:24,120
showed up in the hospital emergency room.

373
00:28:26,120 --> 00:28:28,080
A nurse passing by

374
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:29,520
found the unconscious Bai Feili

375
00:28:29,520 --> 00:28:31,400
in the hospital emergency room

376
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,880
and woke him up.

377
00:28:35,600 --> 00:28:38,080
Bai Feili woke up in a daze.

378
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,320
But

379
00:28:39,320 --> 00:28:41,200
it's like two different people.

380
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,760
From then on,

381
00:28:46,280 --> 00:28:48,800
the blockbuster South Song in the Comic Con

382
00:28:48,880 --> 00:28:50,320
was shelved

383
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:53,400
and never played again.

384
00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,600
Rumors have it that

385
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,520
there's only one person in Bai Feili's heart that can play the role of Liu Xichan.

386
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,440
Only one.

387
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:02,000
So,

388
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,680
he started to find her.

389
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,360
But he searched all the theaters

390
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,440
in Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Shanghai,

391
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,800
he couldn't find the person called Yan Peishan.

392
00:29:15,120 --> 00:29:16,640
I'm afraid

393
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,480
only you

394
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,720
can tell us the truth.

395
00:29:26,040 --> 00:29:27,400
Yes. Chocolate.

396
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,440
It is of great importance.

397
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,760
Please tell us.

398
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:31,720
Was she angry

399
00:29:31,720 --> 00:29:33,160
because we misunderstood her?

400
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:34,160
We just wanted a chance

401
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:35,640
to apologize to her face to face.

402
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:39,280
I...

403
00:29:39,480 --> 00:29:40,920
I really don't know anything.

404
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,040
I'm here for an interview today.

405
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,120
Help me out!

406
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:44,160
If you don't tell us today

407
00:29:44,160 --> 00:29:45,720
where Yan Peisha is.

408
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,520
Well,

409
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:48,880
no interviews.

410
00:29:54,200 --> 00:29:56,400
Did you go to the Shandengting troupe?

411
00:29:57,440 --> 00:29:58,400
Boss.

412
00:30:21,080 --> 00:30:22,600
Tonight,

413
00:30:23,040 --> 00:30:24,760
Dragon Scale wants to meet us.

414
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,840
Didn't I tell you to turn them down?

415
00:30:30,160 --> 00:30:32,080
Everyone wants to perform Dragon Scale.

416
00:30:32,080 --> 00:30:33,760
You're the only one who keeps saying no.

417
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:39,480
In its project,

418
00:30:39,800 --> 00:30:40,760
the management has arranged everything

419
00:30:40,760 --> 00:30:42,520
very clearly.

420
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,400
All they need is an executor.

421
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:47,080
A construction crew that can

422
00:30:47,080 --> 00:30:49,120
stack up those famous scenes.

423
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,440
But Jiubai is different.

424
00:30:53,080 --> 00:30:56,040
Jiubai is a creator that stands on the shoulders of the original.

425
00:30:56,360 --> 00:30:58,840
But the creator also needs money.

426
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:01,840
Jiubai is a studio that makes money from projects,

427
00:31:02,040 --> 00:31:04,560
not a small club in the college.

428
00:31:06,440 --> 00:31:07,880
It has been three months

429
00:31:07,880 --> 00:31:09,320
since Suzhou Comic Con.

430
00:31:09,320 --> 00:31:11,120
We haven't worked for three months.

431
00:31:11,360 --> 00:31:12,600
You keep pressing the pause button.

432
00:31:12,600 --> 00:31:14,160
Jiubai won't be able to operate.

433
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,040
Do you know?

434
00:31:21,000 --> 00:31:22,400
You're so persistent.

435
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:25,240
Are you looking for the character of Liu Xichan,

436
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,480
or the person Yan Peishan?

437
00:31:35,400 --> 00:31:36,320
Her name is Yu Fei.

438
00:31:37,360 --> 00:31:39,080
She's the only one who understands Liu Xichan.

439
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:41,600
Until we find her,

440
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,960
we can restart the series of South Song.

441
00:31:50,400 --> 00:31:52,040
Hao Shi gave me a clue.

442
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:54,640
I can tell you.

443
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:57,160
But today you have to promise me

444
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,160
tonight

445
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,160
you'll meet the management of Dragon Scale.

446
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:05,800
Where is she?

447
00:32:05,920 --> 00:32:07,040
Shandengting troupe.

448
00:32:08,920 --> 00:32:11,480
But I've been there many times.

449
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,000
Believe it or not,

450
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,160
I've already told you the information.

451
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,640
Don't forget

452
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:18,480
tonight's dinner.

453
00:32:43,160 --> 00:32:44,960
Even if it's just a moment.

454
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,400
Even if

455
00:32:46,840 --> 00:32:49,000
we've seen the ending.

456
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:51,880
But maybe it's just an eye contact.

457
00:32:52,760 --> 00:32:54,640
Maybe just an eye contact.

458
00:32:55,400 --> 00:32:57,040
Liu Xichan and the scholar

459
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,320
will understand

460
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:00,960
they've been together

461
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,160
for thousands of years.

462
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,880
No matter how it ends,

463
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,600
that eye contact

464
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,960
realizes their love.

465
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:15,280
Yu Fei,

466
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,160
I'm gonna find you.

467
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:33,440
Is it safe to keep the key on the doorstep?

468
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:35,160
I read online that

469
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,720
many small hotels and rented houses

470
00:33:36,720 --> 00:33:38,040
have hidden cameras.

471
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:39,040
Accidentally,

472
00:33:40,840 --> 00:33:41,880
your privacy

473
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:43,320
will be exposed.

474
00:33:43,640 --> 00:33:45,040
Hopefully you won't fail to find a camera,

475
00:33:45,040 --> 00:33:46,480
and instead find an extra screw

476
00:33:46,640 --> 00:33:47,840
when you restore the front panel.

477
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,280
Can you have some confidence in me?

478
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,840
Wang Zhongqiang.

479
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,160
Don't call my full name!

480
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,960
People in this building would be frightened by the sound of my name.

481
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:03,240
Be careful.

482
00:34:04,560 --> 00:34:05,280
Well.

483
00:34:05,280 --> 00:34:06,440
There's something.

484
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:07,840
When you open it,

485
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:09,600
you realize it was bad from the start.

486
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,239
But you don't have to worry about that either.

487
00:34:11,239 --> 00:34:12,920
I'll just buy you a new one.

488
00:34:12,920 --> 00:34:14,880
When are you going to change

489
00:34:14,880 --> 00:34:16,239
this bad habit of extravagance?

490
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:21,080
Making money is for living.

491
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:25,679
Look, I bring you new life.

492
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:27,239
So girly.

493
00:34:27,239 --> 00:34:28,920
You just need this kind of stuff

494
00:34:28,920 --> 00:34:30,480
to adjust yourself.

495
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,480
You're wasting money.

496
00:34:34,360 --> 00:34:35,360
Did you find a job?

497
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,199
I don't have to find a job.

498
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:41,320
Jobs come to me.

499
00:34:45,159 --> 00:34:46,719
You even have a business card.

500
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,760
X Club.

501
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:50,360
Big salesman.

502
00:34:51,120 --> 00:34:53,080
X Club, have you heard of it?

503
00:34:53,880 --> 00:34:56,120
Friends dinner, family activities,

504
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:58,760
press conferences and ceremonies are all covered.

505
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:01,880
It's the largest and most comprehensive entertainment complex in Shanghai.

506
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:05,400
The boss cried and begged me to come.

507
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:06,480
He also said to me,

508
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,760
I couldn't just benefit the people of Suzhou.

509
00:35:08,840 --> 00:35:10,800
Shanghai people's cultural and recreational life

510
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:11,920
also needs me.

511
00:35:12,200 --> 00:35:13,440
Fine.

512
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,960
You benefit the people of Shanghai.

513
00:35:18,240 --> 00:35:20,000
Where are you going later?

514
00:35:20,240 --> 00:35:22,480
You take me to the Laoqi Restaurant.

515
00:35:22,480 --> 00:35:23,600
I'm on duty today.

516
00:35:24,120 --> 00:35:26,120
Do you have to work?

517
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:28,200
I can watch plays.

518
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,480
I can also make money.

519
00:35:29,960 --> 00:35:31,360
So nice.

520
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:33,760
I'd like to support you.

521
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,080
Forget it.

522
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:36,440
Feed yourself first.

523
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:39,600
Yu Fei.

524
00:35:41,240 --> 00:35:42,240
Actually,

525
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:45,480
in my heart,

526
00:35:46,560 --> 00:35:47,640
you're...

527
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,360
Cockroach!

528
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:51,600
Wang Zhongqiang, come down!

529
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,960
Come down! Hurry up!

530
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,320
What house did you rent!

531
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:55,400
I read online that,

532
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:56,160
seeing one

533
00:35:56,160 --> 00:35:57,520
means there're a hundred hidden there.

534
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:58,920
Don't worry. I have the insect repellant.

535
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:01,720
Don't spray.

536
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:02,600
Wang Zhongqiang.

537
00:36:03,640 --> 00:36:05,440
How can I sleep later?

538
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:08,120
Can you be more unreliable?

539
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:09,560
That's true.

540
00:36:09,880 --> 00:36:11,120
There're only things you can't think of.

541
00:36:11,120 --> 00:36:12,320
There's nothing I can't do.

542
00:36:12,680 --> 00:36:13,160
Here.

543
00:36:22,280 --> 00:36:23,400
I read online that

544
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:24,840
a lot of girls

545
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,680
keep potted plants in their houses.

546
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:30,680
Spend less time on the internet, Spiderman!

547
00:36:30,880 --> 00:36:32,280
Other girls raise flowers.

548
00:36:32,280 --> 00:36:33,200
What's this?

549
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:34,520
Tree.

550
00:36:34,720 --> 00:36:36,840
Flowers will be dead after a few days.

551
00:36:37,080 --> 00:36:38,120
But this potted plant is different.

552
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:39,840
It has roots

553
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:41,240
and it can live for a long time.

554
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:45,280
I remember when you went to the Shandengting troupe at the age of twelve,

555
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:46,560
you just brought a suitcase.

556
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:49,200
Yu Fei.

557
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:50,360
Yu Fei.

558
00:36:50,600 --> 00:36:51,240
Byebye.

559
00:36:52,760 --> 00:36:53,560
Byebye.

560
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,720
And you came back to Suzhou with a suitcase too.

561
00:36:58,720 --> 00:36:59,520
Here. Kebab!

562
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:02,440
Come on, let's go home.

563
00:37:03,520 --> 00:37:06,200
Dao Ge, you really should go to Shanghai to have a look with me.

564
00:37:06,200 --> 00:37:08,240
The big city is different.

565
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:10,240
Big city.

566
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:13,080
I prefer our little place.

567
00:37:13,240 --> 00:37:14,600
You know what.

568
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,960
The kebabs here are the best!

569
00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:18,640
I think about it every time I go to school.

570
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:20,240
This time back to Shanghai,

571
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:22,360
you took nothing but a suitcase.

572
00:37:26,240 --> 00:37:28,000
Don't you bring some Aunt Pei's stuff?

573
00:37:28,640 --> 00:37:29,520
At least,

574
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:30,880
you have something to remember.

575
00:37:32,160 --> 00:37:33,360
I took her will.

576
00:37:35,400 --> 00:37:36,680
She wanted to see me become a famous actor.

577
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:38,960
So this time I go to Shanghai,

578
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:40,240
I'll take the exam of drama school.

579
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:42,960
Break the cloud.

580
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:44,160
Become famous.

581
00:37:44,960 --> 00:37:45,920
What if

582
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:47,880
you leave for good?

583
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:50,800
Then I'm leaving for good.

584
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,480
So...

585
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,280
Since you are prepared

586
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:14,500
[Hexing Building]

587
00:38:10,280 --> 00:38:11,480
to leave for good,

588
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,040
I'll give you something with roots.

589
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,120
Hope you can take root here

590
00:38:15,120 --> 00:38:16,480
as you wish.

591
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:17,080
Of course.

592
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:19,040
It's OK when you regret it.

593
00:38:19,600 --> 00:38:21,360
It's handy to carry it around anyway.

594
00:38:21,840 --> 00:38:22,840
Nice.

595
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,360
The car has been replaced with a scooter.

596
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,440
Shanghai is so congested.

597
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,520
Of course it's convenient to ride a scooter.

598
00:38:34,560 --> 00:38:36,120
For those successful people like me,

599
00:38:36,120 --> 00:38:38,800
time is more expensive than ostentation.

600
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,880
You're right.

601
00:38:49,600 --> 00:38:50,760
You‘re more suitable

602
00:38:50,760 --> 00:38:52,200
for this scooter.

603
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:52,960
Take it.

604
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:55,320
In Shanghai, you don't have little brothers

605
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:56,960
to help you pick up things.

606
00:38:56,960 --> 00:38:58,040
Be careful.

607
00:38:58,280 --> 00:38:59,000
OK.

608
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:00,120
Get on.

609
00:39:01,040 --> 00:39:03,040
Can you really ride it?

610
00:39:08,120 --> 00:39:08,800
Hey.

611
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,880
Hey. Where are you?

612
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,160
I'm coming.

613
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:20,960
Well, I'm a little hungry.

614
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:22,080
I'm gonna go grab a bite.

615
00:39:22,280 --> 00:39:23,960
What are you doing? I'll take you.

616
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:25,000
You don't have to.

617
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:26,120
I don't want to hold up your time

618
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,600
to make money.

619
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:30,640
Club. Fashionable!

620
00:39:30,640 --> 00:39:32,120
Club.

621
00:39:32,680 --> 00:39:33,520
When you get off work,

622
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,760
don't forget your admission ticket.

623
00:39:35,120 --> 00:39:36,280
My brain is better than yours.

624
00:39:36,280 --> 00:39:37,440
I need you to remind me?

625
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,080
I'm leaving.

626
00:39:57,560 --> 00:39:59,120
We are X Club.

627
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:01,520
The largest integrated entertainment complex in Shanghai.

628
00:40:01,760 --> 00:40:02,600
The curtain is up every night.

629
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,840
There're performances every night.

630
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:05,360
What's a performance?

631
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,840
Only when there's an audience.

632
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:08,040
Didn't you say

633
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:09,440
you are the No.1 salesman in Suzhou

634
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,520
and you're awesome?

635
00:40:11,840 --> 00:40:13,120
I'm new in Shanghai.

636
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:15,640
It takes time to develop regular customers.

637
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:17,400
Do you think this is a job

638
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,440
or a relationship?

639
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:20,600
How about the whole club starving to

640
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:22,560
wait for you to get acquainted with the people of Shanghai?

641
00:40:23,240 --> 00:40:24,360
If there're no sales tonight,

642
00:40:24,360 --> 00:40:25,360
pack your bags and leave.

643
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,160
Why are you still following me?

644
00:40:29,560 --> 00:40:31,280
Get on with your sales.

645
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:32,960
OK.

646
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,000
What are you doing?

647
00:40:46,960 --> 00:40:48,040
I'm new here.

648
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,240
Let me help you.
