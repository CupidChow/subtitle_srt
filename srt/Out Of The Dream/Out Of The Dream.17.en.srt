What's the matter?

344
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:03,480
Just tell me.

345
00:21:06,680 --> 00:21:07,560
We...

346
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:08,400
Nothing.

347
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:09,760
We just want to

348
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:10,920
keep you informed of our progress.

349
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:13,920
Boss.

350
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:14,960
Right now

351
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:17,160
everything is going very well.

352
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:19,440
As for the male lead...

353
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:21,840
I have other plans.

354
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:23,560
Anything else?

355
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:25,520
Actually...

356
00:21:26,560 --> 00:21:27,120
Actually, Boss,

357
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:29,920
we're on the roll now.

358
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:31,720
The official Weibo account

359
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:33,160
has more than a million followers.

360
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:35,720
Li Hentian has still got a little conscience.

361
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:37,040
He thanked Jiubai for many times.

362
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:39,120
In that case,

363
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,680
although they broke box office records every time,

364
00:21:40,680 --> 00:21:42,120
it won't be that annoying.

365
00:21:42,920 --> 00:21:43,920
So?

366
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:45,040
So,

367
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,040
I studied the statistics lately.

368
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:53,160
I found some information on the Internet.

369
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:54,520
Let me show you.

370
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,520
Very convincing.

371
00:21:58,360 --> 00:22:00,000
I scoured the Internet for every search term

372
00:22:00,000 --> 00:22:02,480
that included Jiubai this month.

373
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:04,040
The top 5

374
00:22:04,160 --> 00:22:05,320
are

375
00:22:05,800 --> 00:22:06,640
Guanshan,

376
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,520
Jiubai Guanshan,

377
00:22:08,880 --> 00:22:10,080
Guanshan the male lead,

378
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,840
Guanshan's true identity,

379
00:22:12,160 --> 00:22:13,560
Guanshan and Lihen are a CP.

380
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:18,840
In other words,

381
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:20,240
70% of them

382
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:21,440
are your supporters.

383
00:22:21,960 --> 00:22:23,680
And 30%

384
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:26,080
just love watching you two together.

385
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:29,160
Don’t give it another thought.

386
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,520
There is no way I would agree to

387
00:22:30,520 --> 00:22:32,240
Guanshan playing the leading role.

388
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,280
Those who agree please clap your hands.

389
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:46,520
So don't say no anymore.

390
00:22:47,600 --> 00:22:49,400
Just say yes if you're a man.

391
00:22:50,720 --> 00:22:51,440
I don't accept it.

392
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
You what?

393
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,360
You are now the pillar of Jiubai.

394
00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,160
Who will do it if you don't?

395
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,360
Even if I do,

396
00:23:04,160 --> 00:23:05,360
it's only temporary.

397
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:05,960
Ok.

398
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:07,120
He said yes.

399
00:23:07,120 --> 00:23:08,080
Applaud for him.

400
00:23:11,040 --> 00:23:11,680
Okay.

401
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:13,640
Let's get down to business.

402
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:14,920
Guanjiu and I are going on a business trip

403
00:23:14,920 --> 00:23:16,640
for a brand cooperation this weekend.

404
00:23:16,640 --> 00:23:18,360
Catch up on your work tonight

405
00:23:18,360 --> 00:23:20,320
and go over it.

406
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:25,370
[Dream of the South][South Song]

407
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:26,280
Okay.

408
00:23:26,280 --> 00:23:27,880
Don't be upset, you guys.

409
00:23:27,880 --> 00:23:28,880
Stand up to work.

410
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:30,760
Go on with your work.

411
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:36,520
Guanjiu,

412
00:23:36,520 --> 00:23:38,560
your suitcase is still in the studio.

413
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:39,880
Yes.

414
00:23:39,880 --> 00:23:41,880
Because I often have to travel provisionally,

415
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:43,560
so I prepared my luggage in the company.

416
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:46,480
You go on business trips with him a lot?

417
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:48,840
What's wrong?

418
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:50,480
You want to go, too?

419
00:23:51,080 --> 00:23:52,600
Yes. Is that alright?

420
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:54,920
You Pumpkins

421
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,560
always think of business trips

422
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,160
as junkets.

423
00:23:58,720 --> 00:23:59,760
Last business trip

424
00:23:59,760 --> 00:24:01,400
took me to five cities in three days.

425
00:24:01,960 --> 00:24:03,280
Don't know

426
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:04,840
how tiring it would be this time.

News!

439
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,680
The class we chose is taught by a different teacher now.

440
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:31,960
He's so handsome.

441
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:33,440
But I heard he's strict.

442
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,560
Stay tuned for follow-up reports.

443
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:37,200
Sad news!

444
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:38,920
The teacher is really strict.

445
00:25:38,920 --> 00:25:39,640
He doesn't use Powerpoint,

446
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:41,440
nor computer, nor loud-speaker.

447
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:42,640
If students use mobile phones in class,

448
00:25:42,640 --> 00:25:44,000
he'll confiscate them.

449
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:46,880
He has confiscated 3 phones in another class.

450
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
Where are you? Where are you?

451
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:51,880
We have a lesson today, have you forgotten?

452
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,160
Come, come, come.

453
00:25:54,160 --> 00:25:55,680
Training room, training room, training room.

454
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:58,280
It's very urgent.

455
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,000
Where are we?

456
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,720
Don't worry, no roll call.

457
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:06,360
But the teacher is very strict.

458
00:27:06,360 --> 00:27:07,480
Be careful.

459
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,720
Anyone who wants to talk please go outside.

460
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:27,840
Zaju and poetic dramas

461
00:27:28,200 --> 00:27:29,760
conform to the etiquette between monarch and his subjects,

462
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,840
deepen the kinship between father and son,

463
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,160
help with the harmony between older and younger,

464
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,840
arouse the joy between husband and wife.

465
00:27:41,800 --> 00:27:43,000
The one who is late,

466
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,440
please go on.

467
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,400
Promote the courtesy of guests and friends...

468
00:27:53,400 --> 00:27:55,160
Come here and write it on the blackboard.

469
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:36,800
It's not in the book.

470
00:28:44,920 --> 00:28:46,480
Do you understand

471
00:28:46,480 --> 00:28:48,240
what this paragraph means?

472
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,320
The essence of Peking Opera

473
00:28:55,880 --> 00:28:58,720
lies in promoting education and morality,

474
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,480
and improving people's relations and customs.

475
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:04,240
Through aesthetic appreciation,

476
00:29:04,560 --> 00:29:05,400
it can rectify

477
00:29:05,680 --> 00:29:07,080
unhealthy tendencies of the society.

478
00:29:07,080 --> 00:29:09,320
What if the actors of opera don't even conform?

479
00:29:13,040 --> 00:29:14,400
Choose the easy ways,

480
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,120
and you want to perform in opera?

481
00:29:19,040 --> 00:29:20,160
I will accept punishment.

482
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:39,760
Don't move.

483
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:43,520
Yu Fei.

484
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
A hunchback wants to act in opera?

485
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,800
Don't slack off when you practice.

486
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:53,160
This is not a place for you to be lazy.

487
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,960
Yu Fei, hang in there.

488
00:30:11,960 --> 00:30:12,960
You can do this.

489
00:30:21,640 --> 00:30:31,760
One, two. One, two. One, two.

493

You are a Senior Male.

494
00:31:53,280 --> 00:31:54,640
Lin Chong's Fleeing by Night needs an Acrobatic Male.

495
00:31:55,160 --> 00:31:56,200
You begged me to come here,

496
00:31:56,760 --> 00:31:57,560
so I can see

497
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,080
you're not doing your job?

498
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,840
Actresses are afraid of Young Nun’s Worldly Desires and actors Lin Chong's Fleeing by Night.

499
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,960
Can I get a pass

500
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,920
for Lin Chong's Fleeing by Night I just performed?

501
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:22,400
You can take notes.

502
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:24,720
Next time

503
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:26,840
we'll have a presentation before class.

504
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:28,760
The score

505
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,120
will be a part of the overall rating.

506
00:32:30,520 --> 00:32:31,720
You are free to team up.

507
00:32:33,160 --> 00:32:34,520
Any volunteers?

508
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:41,200
The one who took picture,

509
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:43,200
you first.

510
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,760
Computer, video and Powerpoint

511
00:32:45,760 --> 00:32:46,720
are not allowed.

512
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:49,960
But what if I have to give an example?

513
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:52,520
All the singing and postures involved in the speech

514
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,240
will be done by you.

515
00:32:55,240 --> 00:32:56,560
But I only study the lines.

516
00:32:56,560 --> 00:32:58,120
I don't know how to sing.

517
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,280
So,

518
00:33:02,600 --> 00:33:04,160
if you don't sing yourself,

519
00:33:04,160 --> 00:33:06,240
how do you know the lines you write

520
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:07,800
can actually be sung?

521
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:12,160
Does anyone want to team up with her?

522
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,880
The one doing handstand.

523
00:33:23,400 --> 00:33:24,400
Put your legs down.

524
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:30,640
You team up with her.

525
00:33:31,280 --> 00:33:32,400
No problem.

526
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:40,440
-So that's the topic for the next presentation. 
-Thank you.

527
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:42,960
Please get ready.

528
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:44,160
This score

529
00:33:44,440 --> 00:33:46,240
will be worth 30% of the total score.

530
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:47,880
The class is dismissed.

531
00:33:56,840 --> 00:33:58,480
I'm the one who got you into this.

532
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,360
It's alright.

533
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,040
It's going to happen anyway.

534
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,680
How can it be alright?

535
00:34:04,080 --> 00:34:05,560
I didn't expect that Mr. Ni

536
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:07,920
looks handsome,

537
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:10,040
but is cold and heartless.

538
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:11,600
But don't you worry.

539
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,600
Receiving drips of water when in need, and I shall return the kindness with a spring.

540
00:34:14,600 --> 00:34:16,199
I, Da Die, for all these years,

541
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,120
the last thing I like

542
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:18,600
is owing someone a favor.

543
00:34:18,920 --> 00:34:20,120
Don't bother.

544
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,280
I take it

545
00:34:22,280 --> 00:34:24,000
you're a generous girl.

546
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:25,320
You know what.

547
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:26,679
I'll pass on my precious

548
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,440
secrets of love to you.

549
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:30,840
No need for that.

550
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,520
It's no trouble at all.

551
00:34:33,520 --> 00:34:35,480
Girls should help girls.

552
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:36,920
Our university

553
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,239
is just like a famous nunnery

554
00:34:38,239 --> 00:34:40,000
due to a severe gender imbalance.

555
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:43,280
Secrets of love, the first trick,

556
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:46,159
making sweet encounters.

557
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:47,760
The second trick,

558
00:34:48,120 --> 00:34:50,080
showing your tenderness.

559
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,760
The third trick,

560
00:34:52,199 --> 00:34:53,960
don't be afraid to ask for what you want.

561
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:56,440
Your demands, all of them.

562
00:34:59,800 --> 00:35:02,280
You don't seem to believe me.

563
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:03,040
You don't believe me?

564
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,760
I believe you.

565
00:35:06,320 --> 00:35:06,880
Look.

566
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:08,160
The handsome boy over there.

567
00:35:08,520 --> 00:35:10,720
I'll make him fall for me immediately.

568
00:35:12,640 --> 00:35:13,480
Here. Come on.

569
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:14,680
Okay.

570
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:25,800
Excuse me,

571
00:35:26,400 --> 00:35:28,440
can you help me up?

572
00:35:37,960 --> 00:35:38,680
Da Die,

573
00:35:40,040 --> 00:35:41,000
get up.

574
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:44,040
Your class is over?

575
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,160
Why are you here?

576
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,160
I came to pick you up

577
00:35:48,160 --> 00:35:49,400
in case you don't know your way.

578
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:52,760
This is my friend, Da Die.

579
00:35:53,640 --> 00:35:54,600
Da Die. Nice to meet you.

580
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,360
I brought you mung bean ice-cream stick.

581
00:36:00,600 --> 00:36:01,800
Are you kidding me?

582
00:36:09,080 --> 00:36:11,160
Da Die doesn't reply to my Wechat message.

583
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,280
The routine of college life

584
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:16,960
is really hard to deal with.

585
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,760
I suspect

586
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,200
you're about to ruin

587
00:36:22,200 --> 00:36:23,560
my first friendship in college.

588
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:27,800
Such a fragile friendship,

589
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:28,920
you don't need it.

590
00:36:30,840 --> 00:36:32,960
Such an unreliable boyfriend,

591
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:34,440
I don't need it.

592
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,520
Right, Cang?

593
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:38,880
Well?

594
00:36:40,120 --> 00:36:40,840
So you don't want

595
00:36:40,840 --> 00:36:43,360
these two VIP tickets

596
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,480
to the carnival as well?

597
00:36:52,600 --> 00:36:53,760
But aren't you

598
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,240
going on a business trip this weekend?

599
00:36:56,480 --> 00:36:57,200
It's an opportunity for you

600
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:59,360
to fix your relationship with your friend.

601
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:04,360
I have appointments

602
00:37:04,360 --> 00:37:05,480
for the next three days.

603
00:37:07,040 --> 00:37:07,960
What do you mean?

604
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:11,600
I have a 15-minute speech to give.

605
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,880
Thirty percent of my usual grade.

606
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,880
What's more,

607
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:19,440
there are 20 reference books to read.

608
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:21,240
I haven't read any of them yet.

609
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:25,640
What kind of teacher is that?

610
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,360
A new teacher.

611
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:31,720
He's a little strict.

612
00:37:34,920 --> 00:37:36,080
Too bad

613
00:37:36,080 --> 00:37:38,840
the carnival only lasts three days a year.

614
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:40,320
Looks like

615
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:42,160
I'm gonna miss it again.

616
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:45,680
What's

617
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:47,960
your favorite part of the carnival?

618
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,360
"Welcome".

619
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:54,960
What's that?

620
00:37:56,120 --> 00:37:57,600
How can I buy a ticket

621
00:37:57,840 --> 00:37:59,360
that costs so much?

622
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:01,080
So

623
00:38:01,080 --> 00:38:02,680
I invented

624
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,200
an exclusive program for myself.

625
00:38:04,600 --> 00:38:05,800
It's called "Welcome".

626
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:07,680
Every time I would say "welcome"

627
00:38:07,680 --> 00:38:09,680
at the door to those kids

628
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:12,320
in white gauze skirts

629
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:13,680
riding on their dads' shoulders.

630
00:38:14,480 --> 00:38:15,360
It was as if

631
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,600
I owned the whole amusement park

632
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,120
and all the fun of the carnival

633
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,640
was related to me.

634
00:38:22,280 --> 00:38:23,240
What about you?

635
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:25,320
What's your favorite part of the carnival?

636
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:30,240
Another one.

637
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,160
Another one?

638
00:38:33,080 --> 00:38:34,280
What? Dance?

639
00:38:35,240 --> 00:38:37,200
Another ice-cream stick.

640
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:39,760
As soon as

641
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:42,040
you finish the mung bean popsicles in the fridge,

642
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:43,400
I'll come back

643
00:38:43,880 --> 00:38:45,160
and take you to the amusement park.

644
00:38:45,160 --> 00:38:45,840
How's that?

645
00:38:47,360 --> 00:38:49,880
I'll eat it all in one go.

646
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:52,680
Really? I hope you won't have diarrhea.

647
00:38:54,520 --> 00:38:56,280
All right, have a good review.

648
00:38:56,280 --> 00:38:57,560
The exam is in two days.

649
00:38:59,040 --> 00:38:59,640
Come on.

650
00:40:03,470 --> 00:40:05,120
♫I have not forgotten.♫

651
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:06,700
♫I'll never forget.♫

652
00:40:06,730 --> 00:40:10,550
♫I fell into the abyss and the nightmare and I cannot reach the light.♫

653
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,040
Are you still doing your homework?

654
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:20,000
[Breakdown]

655
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,000
Of course not.

656
00:40:17,400 --> 00:40:18,080
I...

657
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:20,160
How could my weekend be so miserable?

658
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,880
I just got back from a movie.

659
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:31,800
How's your task going?

660
00:40:32,240 --> 00:40:33,800
I read the reference books,

661
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,200
and wrote an outline.

662
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:36,840
I also said I miss you.

663
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:38,640
When did you say that?

664
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:39,760
I didn't hear you.

665
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:41,600
I said, I said it just now.

666
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,000
You just didn't hear me.

667
00:40:44,080 --> 00:40:44,760
The meeting is going to begin.

668
00:40:45,440 --> 00:40:46,240
Right away!

669
00:40:46,240 --> 00:40:47,160
Go.

670
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,000
Hurry.

671
00:40:53,440 --> 00:40:55,000
I've got a few things to deal with.

672
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:56,520
Go ahead.

673
00:40:57,040 --> 00:40:58,000
Get it over with.

674
00:40:58,200 --> 00:40:59,000
Come back early.

675
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,680
Goodbye.

676
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:00,480
Goodbye.

677
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,400
Everyone in Jiubai,

678
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:08,560
we are in desperate need of

679
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:10,280
an actor with martial arts background.

680
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,880
We need to think of something.
