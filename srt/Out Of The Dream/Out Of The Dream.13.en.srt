4
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:52,759
Where are we going?

5
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:54,600
You asked me to be formally dressed.

6
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,680
Yes, because I'll take you to eat delicious food.

7
00:01:59,240 --> 00:01:59,960
Here we are.

8
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,800
Closed.

9
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:08,720
It has been shut.

10
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,240
What should we do?

11
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,680
Why not check its opening hours before going out?

12
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,880
What are you laughing at?

13
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,840
I'm still dressed like this. Where should we go?

14
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,440
Come in. Mr Bai.

15
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:21,320
Come with me.

16
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,720
The owner is a friend of mine.

17
00:02:29,720 --> 00:02:31,240
It should have been closed at this time.

18
00:02:31,240 --> 00:02:32,320
I specially asked him

19
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:33,880
for a 2-hour extension.

20
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,520
This way, please.

21
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,520
Thank you.

22
00:02:46,079 --> 00:02:46,800
Shall we go?

23
00:02:57,640 --> 00:02:58,480
Have a seat.

24
00:03:16,079 --> 00:03:17,440
To celebrate our 100th day,

25
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:18,440
it's my treat today.

26
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:20,160
It'll be your turn to treat on the 1000th day.

27
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:25,480
Would you like to order now?

28
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:26,640
Yes.

29
00:03:27,400 --> 00:03:29,280
Let me introduce the menu.

30
00:03:29,600 --> 00:03:32,880
Salad mushroom, potato, carrot,

31
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:34,480
and broccoli.

32
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,680
Soup is made from broccoli,

33
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:38,040
potato onions,

34
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:40,320
and chicken beef salad.

35
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,400
Miss,

36
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:52,840
For starters, I recommend a roadside seafood barbecue.

37
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:54,480
If you want something else,

38
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:57,040
I recommend Italian mushroom noodles for the main course.

39
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:59,640
If you want a more exotic flavor,

40
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:02,320
Japanese-style half-cooked beef

41
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:03,440
is also a good choice.

42
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,640
Miss,

43
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:09,560
if you have a problem with my service,

44
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:10,760
you can make a complaint,

45
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:13,440
but please don't laugh at me, okay?

46
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,760
Then I'll have

47
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:17,920
Italian mushroom noodles.

48
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:28,320
We'd like to order two pieces of Italian spaghetti with beacon.

49
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,120
OK.

50
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,000
Thank you.

51
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:36,240
Let's have a deal.

52
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:38,080
You must stand treat on the 1000th day.

53
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:40,720
People like you who value promises

54
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:42,200
are not supposed to pull back, right?

55
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:43,920
Okay.

56
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,080
Even if we break up later,

57
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:48,960
I'll treat you to dinner.

58
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,000
No way.

59
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:54,680
In college, I majored in law.

60
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:56,840
Don't play games with me.

61
00:04:57,480 --> 00:04:58,560
Fine...

62
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,080
We'll see.

63
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:11,040
I'm gonna put this little napkin

64
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,960
on you first.

65
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:16,080
What's this?

66
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,080
It reads that

67
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:20,480
You'll never get old

68
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:22,080
if you eat with your loved one.

69
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:46,960
Is this my funnel?

70
00:05:48,760 --> 00:05:49,480
No.

71
00:05:49,920 --> 00:05:51,840
It's a satellite launcher.

72
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:57,360
You're quite drunk on only a glass of wine.

73
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,800
Today,

74
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:03,880
you have treated me to a delicious meal,

75
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:05,320
therefore,

76
00:06:05,320 --> 00:06:07,560
I'm going to send you a gift.

77
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,520
There is no need for reciprocity

78
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:14,160
in our relationship.

79
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:17,520
Look.

80
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:18,720
That star

81
00:06:19,720 --> 00:06:20,960
is my friend.

82
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:23,640
I've known it since I was 12,

83
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,440
and talk to it every day.

84
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:30,000
It really had a tough time

85
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:31,560
during the past years.

86
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:38,400
At the age of 12

87
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:40,520
I joined the Shandengting troupe

88
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,640
where I trained very hard every day.

89
00:06:43,920 --> 00:06:46,000
One day, I thought I couldn't bear it anymore.

90
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,200
I ran away from there

91
00:06:47,800 --> 00:06:49,560
but I got lost.

92
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,600
Fortunately, the night was

93
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:53,000
as clear as today.

94
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:55,080
I looked up and saw it.

95
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:57,720
I kept talking to it

96
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,880
while going on walking.

97
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:01,280
Going around like this,

98
00:07:01,480 --> 00:07:03,320
I found myself returning to the troupe.

99
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:05,920
From that day on,

100
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:07,960
I made friends with it.

101
00:07:08,480 --> 00:07:10,920
I talk to it frequently,

102
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:13,240
and tell it everything

103
00:07:13,480 --> 00:07:14,720
that made me sad and bitter.

104
00:07:16,920 --> 00:07:18,000
So...

105
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:20,960
how can you find it every time?

106
00:07:21,800 --> 00:07:24,880
It seems to look for me as well.

107
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:27,960
Every time I look up

108
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,720
it's the first thing I see.

109
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:37,520
It wasn't a cheap meal, right?

110
00:07:38,480 --> 00:07:40,000
But I really enjoyed it,

111
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:42,159
because I know

112
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:45,880
you always share the best things

113
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,280
with me.

114
00:07:48,159 --> 00:07:49,320
In return for this,

115
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:51,800
I share with you

116
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,159
one of my best friends.

117
00:07:53,920 --> 00:07:55,640
You can tell it

118
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:59,000
anything sad or exhausting

119
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:00,960
that you don't want to talk with humans.

120
00:08:03,080 --> 00:08:04,640
It's rarely so generous of you.

121
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,600
You can talk to it when we're together.

122
00:08:07,880 --> 00:08:09,160
You can't if we break up.

123
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:12,080
Hey,

124
00:08:12,680 --> 00:08:15,400
why you always think of something so far away?

125
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,520
So you should do well.

126
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:27,120
Please pass on my words to Yu Fei.

127
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:29,760
I won't let her get away with that.

128
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:31,360
Definitely,

129
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:33,080
I won't let her run away.

130
00:08:33,799 --> 00:08:35,799
No matter how far away she goes,

131
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:38,720
I will by all means to get her back.

132
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,159
Don't say that to the star.

133
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:42,320
It will get angry.

134
00:08:45,320 --> 00:08:46,640
After all these years

135
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:47,960
of hard work,

136
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:50,280
from now on,

137
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:53,000
you can

138
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:54,760
leave her to me.

139
00:08:55,920 --> 00:08:57,320
It's not a loudspeaker.

140
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:58,960
It's launcher.

141
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:00,440
It's used to see.

142
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,080
That depends on me.

143
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:03,760
Did you get it?

144
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:05,200
It didn't.

145
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:08,280
- It did. 
- It didn't.

146
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:09,600
You got it, right?

147
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:11,600
No. Don't say that to it.

148
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:12,960
Did you get it?

149
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:14,240
- Did you get it? 
- No.

150
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,360
No. Give it back to me.

151
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:16,840
Did you get it? Did you?

152

[Jiubai]

153
00:09:27,800 --> 00:09:30,680
Have you abandoned your image off duty?

154
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:35,840
I'm just playing the role of otaku

155
00:09:36,040 --> 00:09:39,200
indulged in comics and online games,

156
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,160
okay?

157
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,680
I think you're just being yourself.

158
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,520
I've got the investment.

159
00:09:52,840 --> 00:09:53,800
20 million.

160
00:09:54,280 --> 00:09:55,560
20 million?

161
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:56,720
Who's that?

162
00:09:57,840 --> 00:09:58,400
My father.

163
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:02,880
But he wants 40% of the shares.

164
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:05,400
We have to dilute our shares by 10% apiece.

165
00:10:06,280 --> 00:10:06,960
No problem.

166
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,720
I didn't expect that

167
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:10,440
your father would have his eye on us,

168
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:12,040
on our plain little studio.

169
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:16,160
He laid down another condition.

170
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:17,200
Not curious?

171
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,600
Besides the share,

172
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:20,040
he has another condition?

173
00:10:20,440 --> 00:10:22,320
He wants us to double our valuation

174
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,640

175
00:10:23,640 --> 00:10:25,800
Otherwise he may take over our studio.

176
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:27,120
That's fine anyway.

177
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,520
At least we can cover the down payment on the show.

178
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,600
Don't try to be funny.

Tell me. What do you think?

181
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,160
To invite him to come back.

182
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:43,560
At least it can cause a sensation.

183
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:45,240
With the increasing concern,

184
00:10:45,520 --> 00:10:47,680
we can turn the traffic into commercial profits.

185
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:49,200
To increase our valuation,

186
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,320
this is the fastest way I can think of.

187
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:52,120
No way.

188
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:54,640
Then we'll decline your father's money,

189
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,480
and put aside the second season of Dream of the South.

190
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,280
We can continue with cosplay photo

191
00:10:58,280 --> 00:10:59,920
and MV shooting to support our studio.

192

everyone has to leave like Gui Deng?

196

I want to believe in myself one more time.

197
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:15,680
After all, people who don't believe in themselves

198
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:18,200
have no value to be given a chance to try.

What a pity that she retired from it after her debut.

Since then, she never appeared on the stage.

00:28:54,280 --> 00:28:55,840
Such a rascally rogue

512
00:28:55,840 --> 00:28:57,760
is sophisticated and crafty.

513
00:28:58,080 --> 00:28:59,280
He has different faces

514
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:00,680
towards different people.

515
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,720
It's worse than tricking old people into buying health products.

516
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:06,040
He's like a wolf in sheep's clothing.

517
00:29:06,560 --> 00:29:07,480
Feifei.

518
00:29:08,560 --> 00:29:10,120
I just like you,

519
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,160
who pretend to be mean

520
00:29:12,160 --> 00:29:14,520
but actually innocent.

521
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,240
Very lovely.

522
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:19,320
Yes, she's innocent.

523
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:20,160
Aunt,

524
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:23,040
though he keeps speaking

525
00:29:23,040 --> 00:29:24,000
sweet words here,

526
00:29:24,120 --> 00:29:25,520
he's intended to delude you.

527
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,120
Let me tell you.

528
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,000
When we're at home,

529
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,840
I do all the things like

530
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:29,480
sweeping and unblocking the drain.

531
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,600
He doesn't do anything.

532
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:35,080
It's not what you think.

533
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:36,880
That's her job now.

534
00:29:36,880 --> 00:29:37,960
I'd better not be involved.

535
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:39,720
But after the marriage,

536
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:41,160
I will do all the things.

537
00:29:41,320 --> 00:29:42,560
Don't worry, aunt.

538
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:46,480
You, you are...

539
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:51,880
So you are...

540
00:29:52,760 --> 00:29:53,840
I forgot to mention that.

541
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:54,680
I'm her boyfriend.

542
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,280
No.

543
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:56,600
Aunt, I'm not familiar with him.

544
00:30:00,000 --> 00:30:02,000
Feifei, you win.

545
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,120
I asked you to keep a close eye on Hao Shi.

546
00:30:03,120 --> 00:30:04,640
You have eyes on another man.

547
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:06,200
Why are you laughing?

548
00:30:06,920 --> 00:30:08,240
Although you're handsome,

549
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:08,960
honey-lipped,

550
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:09,960
and generous,

551
00:30:09,960 --> 00:30:12,160
you can't call me aunt just yet.

552
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:15,960
But Yu Fei and I are indeed in a relationship right now.

553
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:17,720
It's improper to call you sister.

554
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,080
Hey!

555
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:24,240
Your occupation. Hometown.

556
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,000
Family background.

557
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,560
make it clear to me.

558
00:30:28,160 --> 00:30:29,800
Our family,

559
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:31,840
is neither wealthy nor influential,

560
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:32,560
but

561
00:30:32,560 --> 00:30:34,640
Feifei is the only girl in our family.

562
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:35,800
We cherish her very much.

563
00:30:35,800 --> 00:30:38,120
Aunt, we're not going to get married.

564
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:39,680
My name is Bai Feili,

565
00:30:39,920 --> 00:30:41,200
the boss of Jiubai Studio

566
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:42,760
which Hao Shi is working for.

567
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:45,400
Doing Chinoiserie stage plays is a proper job.

568
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,760
And we're running a serious company

569
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,880
with the business licence.

570
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:49,720
Hao Shi is now an intern

571
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,600
receiving the internship salary.

572
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:54,080
If he becomes a regular employee later, he will be insured.

573
00:30:54,520 --> 00:30:55,480
Yu Fei

574
00:30:55,480 --> 00:30:57,120
is now living in my grandparents' house,

575
00:30:57,280 --> 00:30:58,280
and helping with cooking.

576
00:30:58,760 --> 00:31:00,440
Everybody likes her

577
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:02,400
who works seriously and with responsibility.

578
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:03,600
If one day,

579
00:31:03,600 --> 00:31:05,320
we're ready for marriage,

580
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:06,720
all my assets will be handled

581
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
with her opinion into consideration.

582
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,680
Come on,

583
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,320
please stop acting now.

584
00:31:13,520 --> 00:31:16,360
What do you mean by "if we're ready for marriage"?

585
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:17,960
If you're willing,

586
00:31:18,280 --> 00:31:19,960
I'm glad to delete "if".

587
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:24,640
Eh, wait.

588
00:31:24,840 --> 00:31:26,600
You're called Bai Feili.

589
00:31:28,840 --> 00:31:30,520
It can't happen like that.

590
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:32,920
Are you father called Bai as well?

591
00:31:33,440 --> 00:31:34,400
Of course.

592
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:36,760
What a coincidence.

593
00:31:36,760 --> 00:31:37,960
My father and I

594
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:38,880
are both Bai.

595
00:31:39,880 --> 00:31:41,400
It can't happen that

596
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:44,040
he's the Chairman Bai

597
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:47,520
of Shang&Shan Group in central Shanghai, right?

598
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:50,120
What Shang&Shan Group...

599
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:52,520
Bai Juyuan. He's my father.

600
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,240
Wait, let me confirm it.

601
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,320
Are you the young boy of

602
00:31:58,320 --> 00:32:00,320
Shang&Shan Group

603
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,520
which is often in the news?

604
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:04,680
The boy Bai Feili?

605
00:32:06,640 --> 00:32:09,240
Or you're playing the role of Bai Feili?

606
00:32:09,240 --> 00:32:11,360
Are you preparing the show

607
00:32:11,360 --> 00:32:12,680
of Flower Boys?

608
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,880
You guys go ahead and play.

609
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:15,920
I'm gonna do the dishes

610
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:17,720
I haven't had it.

611
00:32:18,280 --> 00:32:19,400
Don't have it then.

612
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:23,680
Is this a plot

613
00:32:23,680 --> 00:32:26,520
that she should play hard to get

614
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:28,360
or is she really angry?

615
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,520
I'd have to check.

616
00:32:38,200 --> 00:32:38,960
Cunning.

617
00:32:40,400 --> 00:32:41,080
Affected.

618
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:43,600
Full of crap.

619
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,600
A cook who uses such harsh words

620
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:48,240
definitely can't cook good mung bean soup.

621
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,120
Why did you leave without saying a word again?

622
00:33:01,800 --> 00:33:03,120
You ignore my call

623
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,200
and hide from me.

624
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,960
But you're making progress, too.

625
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,440
At least I don't get blacklisted this time.

626
00:33:11,080 --> 00:33:12,400
The heavy rain flooded my house.

627
00:33:12,840 --> 00:33:13,960
I came back to fix it.

628
00:33:13,960 --> 00:33:15,240
I had no time to answer your call.

629
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:17,680
We can work things out together.

630
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:19,720
Why didn't you tell me?

631
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,160
Or do I

632
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:23,160
have to know your schedule through Hao Shi?

633
00:33:23,960 --> 00:33:24,800
Does it mean

634
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,080
I have to know you through Guanjiu?

635
00:33:28,760 --> 00:33:29,880
Why do you mention her?

636
00:33:35,080 --> 00:33:36,280
It's just the two of us here.

637
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:37,640
And you don't have to act.

638
00:33:37,920 --> 00:33:39,480
I saw it that night,

639
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:40,560
in the studio.

640
00:33:41,120 --> 00:33:42,360
You were lying on bed.

641
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:43,440
She unbuttoned your clothes

642
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:44,240
and wiped sweat for you.

643
00:33:44,320 --> 00:33:45,040
She also...

644
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:49,120
I got sick that night.

645
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:50,840
I was extremely sleepy

646
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:51,960
after taking medicine.

647
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:54,720
I don't remember any of that.

648
00:33:59,240 --> 00:34:00,480
There's something

649
00:34:01,560 --> 00:34:04,120
that I can't easily speak out right now.

650
00:34:06,440 --> 00:34:08,199
But please don't doubt my love for you

651
00:34:08,960 --> 00:34:10,719
just because of that.

652
00:34:13,960 --> 00:34:16,400
You used to pretend to be lovable before my mom.

653
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,440
Now you pretend to be considerate before my aunt.

654
00:34:20,199 --> 00:34:22,199
You stand in front of me right now, but said

655
00:34:23,040 --> 00:34:25,120
something that you can't easily speak out.

656
00:34:26,560 --> 00:34:29,000
Do you want me to pretend it never happened?

657
00:34:32,120 --> 00:34:33,520
Sometimes I feel

658
00:34:34,800 --> 00:34:36,320
you are walking towards me,

659
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:40,040
but sometimes I feel you're moving back.

660
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,080
Which one is the real you?

661
00:34:45,520 --> 00:34:46,719
Or do you mean

662
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:50,560
I don't deserve to know all about you?

663
00:34:54,480 --> 00:34:55,480
Walking towards you

664
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,040
is because I like you.

665
00:34:59,840 --> 00:35:01,720
Because I want to show you all good things,

666
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:05,400
and hide all the bad ones from you.

667
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:08,840
Moving back is to keep you from running away.

668
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:10,840
I'm not going to run away.

669
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,280
I'm just jealous.

670
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,600
I'm jealous that

671
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:23,240
she met you before I did.

672
00:35:24,800 --> 00:35:27,120
I'm jealous that she knows more about you.

673
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:29,400
I'm jealous that she spent more time

674
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,560
with you than I did.

675
00:35:33,720 --> 00:35:35,800
I'm jealous she can protect your vulnerability inside,

676
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,000
but I can't.

677
00:35:48,600 --> 00:35:49,440
Here

678
00:35:51,960 --> 00:35:53,320
will be in your care in the future.

679
00:36:06,520 --> 00:36:07,440
Promise you.

680
00:36:09,040 --> 00:36:10,160
Don't be angry.

681
