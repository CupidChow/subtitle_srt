[the Shandengting troupe]

5
00:01:44,170 --> 00:01:45,530
These desks and chairs

6
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,240
have to be

7
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:48,560
extremely clean.

8
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:50,120
Every spot has to be clean.

9
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:52,190
Yes. Put it there.

10
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:53,130
Yes.

11
00:01:53,789 --> 00:01:54,750
Master.

12
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:56,360
I have bought the fruits you asked for.

13
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:56,840
Good.

14
00:01:56,840 --> 00:01:57,810
You could check if they are enough.

15
00:01:58,030 --> 00:01:58,870
Oh gosh!

16
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:00,380
Couldn't you be more careful?

17
00:02:01,150 --> 00:02:02,880
You're so clumsy.

18
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:06,200
OK. After the cleaning,

19
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:06,740
do not forget

20
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:08,710
to put them on every table.

21
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:10,120
OK.

22
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,310
Huizi!

23
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:13,540
Where is it?

24
00:02:14,010 --> 00:02:15,080
Huizi! Where is she?

25
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:17,240
Hello, Master.

26
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,860
Did you see her?

27
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:18,380
Nope.

28
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:19,150
Hi, Master.

29
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:22,040
Master.

30
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:25,440
Have you checked all the costumes, cosmetics and props for tonight?

31
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:28,010
Yes. Everything is ready except for Li Feng's apron.

32
00:02:28,329 --> 00:02:30,290
All the clothes cannot be missing. Go find it more carefully.

33
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:31,510
Where did it go after the laundry?

34
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:33,579
You look great in your outfit today!

35
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,570
There you are!

36
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:35,040
Nice!

37
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:37,450
Remember to keep it that way.

38
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:39,980
Uncle! Uncle!

39
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:41,120
I've found the apron!

40
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:42,480
I'll have it ironed now.

41
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:43,570
You can go do your make up now.

42
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:44,530
OK.

43
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,550
If you want to practice, don't spare yourself.

44
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:53,610
If you want to spare yourself, don't even think about going on stage.

45
00:02:55,380 --> 00:02:56,260
If you don't go on stage,

46
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,100
you will never be famous.

47
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:07,420
Go! Go! Come on!

48
00:03:08,030 --> 00:03:09,290
What are you all waiting for?

49
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,420
Why are you

50
00:03:25,570 --> 00:03:26,900
not hiding in the box this time?

51
00:03:29,490 --> 00:03:30,090
Sister.

52
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:33,730
Please stop chasing me! I...

53
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:35,130
- After... After I...
- Stop right there!

54
00:03:35,480 --> 00:03:36,250
Stop right there!

55
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:37,370
It's just

56
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:39,020
the perfect chance for me

57
00:03:39,180 --> 00:03:40,210
to get your mind out of the gutter.

58
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:41,910
Doesn't Master always tell us

59
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:44,020
to persevere in everything we do?

60
00:03:46,740 --> 00:03:47,420
Where do you think you're going?

61
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,700
Why would a Senior Male like you practice the skills of an Acrobatic Male like us?

62
00:03:50,610 --> 00:03:52,040
Because you have been sparing yourself since little

63
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,230
and I have to be the supporting role for you.

64
00:03:53,250 --> 00:03:53,890
Sister. Sister.

65
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:54,760
Sister. Wait a minute.

66
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:56,170
You should keep up with the changes in the would.

67
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,200
Yu Fei! Dude!

68
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,850
I'm in the middle of a game.

69
00:03:58,880 --> 00:03:59,630
Stop playing!

70
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:03,360
Sister. Please hold on a minute.

71
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:05,240
It's going to end very soon!

72
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:07,050
Really. Wait a minute. Very soon.

73
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:09,310
Give it to me!

74
00:04:10,780 --> 00:04:11,880
Why would do that?

75
00:04:12,150 --> 00:04:12,670
I'm not playing with you.

76
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:28,580
How did you even win the game?

77
00:04:29,690 --> 00:04:31,050
Xiao Wu told me that

78
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,880
you have been obsessed with this game.

79
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:36,080
I'll give it back to you after you practicing

80
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:37,050
the Iron Bar skill and show it to us.

81
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:39,090
Don't break your words.

82
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:42,570
But I wonder

83
00:04:42,860 --> 00:04:43,870
how you won the game.

84
00:04:44,460 --> 00:04:45,350
Have you played this game before?

85
00:04:45,830 --> 00:04:47,480
The last time I took away your phone,

86
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:48,620
I did a little research on it.

87
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:50,520
And I adopted the movements and blockings from it

88
00:04:50,659 --> 00:04:52,420
during the rehearsal.

89
00:04:53,270 --> 00:04:54,900
Uncle said I was not bad.

90
00:04:56,830 --> 00:04:57,510
Look at you.

91
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:58,610
In my mind,

92
00:04:58,930 --> 00:05:00,090
only uncle

93
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:01,550
can get you under control.

94
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,510
Nonsense.

95
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:11,750
You little bastard.

96
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:14,020
Stop right there!

97
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:16,150

98
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,440
Yu Fei.

99
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:19,780
Master.

100
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:21,130
I have been looking everywhere for you.

101
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:22,110
Where did you go?

102
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:24,250
You are about to go on stage.

103
00:05:25,410 --> 00:05:26,580
Tonight's show

104
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:27,830
is very important.

105
00:05:28,670 --> 00:05:30,190
Don't screw it up.

106
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:31,940
Trust me.

107
00:05:32,210 --> 00:05:33,130
When have I ever gone wrong

108
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:34,409
performing The Dragon Meets the Phoenix on the stage?

109
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:38,070
Just show them how confident you are.

110
00:05:38,409 --> 00:05:39,580
As long as it goes well today,

111
00:05:39,800 --> 00:05:41,320
the provincial league leaders will be recommending you

112
00:05:41,350 --> 00:05:42,570
to take part in the National Competition for Young Peking Opera Actors this year.

113
00:05:43,960 --> 00:05:44,760
Me?

[the Shandengting troupe]

115
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:48,720
I've prepared a new whisker for you.

116
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,000
Use it tonight.

117
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:51,370
Give them your best show.

118
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,250
Thank you, Master.

119
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:54,790
Do not

120
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,409
embarrass the Shandengting troupe.

121

[the Shandengting troupe]

122
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:23,480
Come in.

123
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:43,120
Uncle.

124
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:45,080
Look.

125
00:06:45,770 --> 00:06:47,990
This is the new whisker Master bought for me.

126
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:55,580
When I started to play the Senior Male role,

127
00:06:56,490 --> 00:06:57,820
I always complained how stinky the whisker was.

128
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,410
Didn't you tell me that when I become famous,

129
00:07:01,770 --> 00:07:03,180
I would have my own whisker?

130
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,330
It's not about you being famous or not.

131
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:09,730
It's that artificial whiskers are not so valuable now.

132
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:17,960
Master even said

133
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,380
that provincial leaders are here today to watch me sing.

134
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:25,160
If I sing well,

135
00:07:25,670 --> 00:07:28,040
they will send me to the National Competition for Young Peking Opera Actors this year.

136
00:07:30,670 --> 00:07:32,110
So you're one of those fame and gain seekers?

137
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:36,630
No, I'm not.

138
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:38,650
It's that I wanted...

139
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:40,400
Uncle, you...

140
00:07:40,570 --> 00:07:41,940
Lanting, just get in there.

141
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,030
Congratulations, uncle.

142
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:47,670
Why didn't you bring us wedding candies?

143
00:07:47,950 --> 00:07:48,800
Even if you have never been married,

144
00:07:48,820 --> 00:07:50,140
have you not attended a wedding before?

145
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:52,170
Wedding candies are always given out after the wedding.

146
00:07:55,690 --> 00:07:56,640
Uncle.

147
00:07:58,290 --> 00:07:59,490
You are getting married?

148
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,390
Sister.

149
00:08:00,790 --> 00:08:02,320
You must be shocked, too.

150
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:04,590
Uncle's fiancee

151
00:08:04,610 --> 00:08:07,330
is Shi Meiqing, the Qing Yi actress from a Peking Opera family.

152
00:08:07,790 --> 00:08:08,620
It's said

153
00:08:09,040 --> 00:08:11,220
to be a love story of Romeo and Juliet.

154
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:12,900
It is such big news

155
00:08:12,980 --> 00:08:14,440
in the Peking Opera circle.

156
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,270
Is it true?

157
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:19,520
Can people fake this kind of thing?

158
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:21,040
Uncle has already asked for a leave.

159
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,180
He's going to get the marriage certificate tomorrow.

160
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:23,700
Give your best show today.

161
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,870
I won't be your partner after today.

162
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:29,060
Are you going to stop singing

163
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:31,320
after getting married?

164
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:34,530
Sister. There is a new Senior Male in our troupe.

165
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,919
Uncle's going to be the newcomer's mentor.

166
00:08:36,860 --> 00:08:37,340
Right.

167
00:08:37,909 --> 00:08:39,640
Master has decided to start a new play for you.

168
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,659
You may be the main role in the future.

169
00:08:41,789 --> 00:08:42,710
Boss Yu!

170
00:08:43,169 --> 00:08:44,210
Yeah, sister.

171
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:45,610
Your time has finally come.

172
00:08:45,700 --> 00:08:46,730
I don't wanna be the main role.

173
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,110
I only wanna go on stage with uncle.

174
00:08:50,690 --> 00:08:51,470
Oh, right, sister.

175
00:08:52,090 --> 00:08:54,410
It's not gonna be the last time you two get on the same stage today.

176
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:56,620
We are planning

177
00:08:57,010 --> 00:08:59,530
that you will be uncle's best man at the wedding.

178
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:00,860
Best man?

179
00:09:01,170 --> 00:09:02,140
# - Sister.
- Isn't it funny?

180
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:03,760
It suits you just right, sister.

181
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:04,530
Are you done?

182
00:09:05,310 --> 00:09:06,210
We have a show later.

183
00:09:11,900 --> 00:09:13,750
I appreciate you two for showing up.

184
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:15,320
Enjoy the food.

185
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:15,800
OK.

186
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,540
We didn't prepare much.

187
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,370
But these foods are made by the apprentices themselves.

188
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:20,440
They made these themselves?

189
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:22,450
Lou.

190
00:09:22,900 --> 00:09:23,980
This is quite exquisite.

191
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:25,120
Then have some more.

192
00:09:26,370 --> 00:09:27,920
Here. I'll pour you some tea.

193
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:32,450
A female is playing the Senior Male role today?

194
00:09:32,650 --> 00:09:33,260
I heard so.

195
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,590
A female playing a Senior Male role? Does that work?

196
00:09:37,250 --> 00:09:38,320
I heard she's quite young.

197
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:41,170
Can she act out the essence of The Dragon Meets the Phoenix?

198
00:09:42,010 --> 00:09:42,670
Let's wait and see.

199
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,080
I heard she's not bad.

200
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:45,530
Just watch.

201
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:23,740
[Leaving the capital and hiding jewels.]

202
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:43,370
[Traveling the country to investigate people's conditions.]

203
00:10:59,450 --> 00:11:01,550
There aren't many female apprentices in the Shandengting.

204
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:04,140
There aren't many female Senior Males in the country as well.

205
00:11:05,570 --> 00:11:06,490
Yu Fei has been sent here

206
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:08,070
to learn Peking Opera since 12.

207
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:09,180
Lou.

208
00:11:10,340 --> 00:11:12,190
This is really rare in our Liyuan Opera circle

209
00:11:12,310 --> 00:11:13,080
in Shanghai.

210
00:11:13,310 --> 00:11:13,750
It's true.

211
00:11:14,270 --> 00:11:15,250
You're flattering me.

212
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:17,710
Li does not have a lot of hobbies

213
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:19,030
except for watching Peking Opera.

214
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,840
And he's got a sharp eye.

215
00:11:21,740 --> 00:11:23,200
So you can put a stop to your modesty.

216
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,570
This girl is good.

217
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:26,710
She's really gifted.

218
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,670
Here comes the antiphon.

219
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,890
[Succession]

220
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:38,550
[Whether you are a good girl or a bad girl,]

221
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:41,340
[you shouldn't wear this flower on you.]

222
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,860
[It does look good on you.]

223
00:11:43,970 --> 00:11:47,480
[But it's also the begonia that makes you look bad.]

224
00:11:47,550 --> 00:11:50,480
[Begonia sure is pretty,]

225
00:11:50,510 --> 00:11:52,550
[but it is also the reason why you are laughing at me.]

226
00:11:52,790 --> 00:11:55,320
[So I'm gonna toss it on the ground]

227
00:11:55,340 --> 00:11:58,820
[and never wear it again.]

228
00:12:03,530 --> 00:12:05,760
[Succession]

229
00:12:10,350 --> 00:12:10,890
Yu Fei.

230
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,190
Don't regard what goes on the stage as a trifling matter.

231
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:20,360
[It's not a reasonable thing for you to do so.]

232
00:12:19,190 --> 00:12:19,900
Less in ten days,

233
00:12:20,390 --> 00:12:23,090
[You shouldn't have tossed this flower.]

234
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:21,990
I am going to find a new Liu Xichan.

235
00:12:23,190 --> 00:12:24,560
Emperor Zhengde

236
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:26,050
[I am going to pick it up]

237
00:12:24,630 --> 00:12:26,820
does not seem to be teasing Li Feng.

238
00:12:26,070 --> 00:12:28,150
[and put it back on you.]

239
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:30,090
He doesn't seem so excited.

240
00:12:30,590 --> 00:12:33,000
[If...]

241
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:35,200
When a female plays a Senior Male role,

242
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,730
she tends to be more attentive.

243
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:43,100
[If you have it back on...]

244
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,400
It must be a little different

245
00:12:38,520 --> 00:12:39,320
from what we saw before.

246
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:41,880
You're right.

247
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:43,710
They have made some slight adjustments in rhythm

248
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,490
according to emotions.

249
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:24,700
I didn't come all the way here

250
00:13:24,870 --> 00:13:26,510
to see her forget her lines.

251
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:28,120
What kind of a play is this?

252
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:29,350
Calm down. Calm down.

253
00:13:30,220 --> 00:13:30,900
Refund!

254
00:13:31,490 --> 00:13:35,190
[Trying every means,]

255
00:13:36,310 --> 00:13:49,160
[I will chase you to the end of the world.]

256
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,550
What happened? Is the electricity off?

257
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:01,890
Who is it?

258
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:04,460
The person who helps you get off the stage

259
00:14:05,430 --> 00:14:06,730
and saves you.

260
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,320
Help me?

261
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:16,050
It's time to take a look at the bigger stages.

262
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,000
Did you watch too many shows?

263
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:20,440
Do you also wanna play the role

264
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,250
of an immoral villain

265
00:14:22,610 --> 00:14:23,960
who always gets away without being blamed?

266
00:14:24,890 --> 00:14:26,270
Actually I need an actor.

267
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,860
I just saw an accident happen to you on stage.

268
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:31,550
So I had to

269
00:14:32,040 --> 00:14:33,370
meet you in this way,

270
00:14:35,370 --> 00:14:36,210
Let me take you out of here.

271
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:38,510
I'm not going. Neither will you.

272
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,160
Master, I have found the person who turned off the switch.

273
00:14:41,990 --> 00:14:42,730
Ungrateful!

274
00:14:43,430 --> 00:14:45,240
Don't run! Stop!

275
00:14:57,590 --> 00:15:00,730
[Succession]

276
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:02,970
Have you known your mistake?

277
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:07,800
The provincial league leaders seemed disappointed.

278
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,670
They didn't even told me before leaving.

279
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,720
You have completely humiliated the Shandengting troupe.

280
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:14,870
Do you know that

281
00:15:14,900 --> 00:15:15,970
you're ruining your own future?

282
00:15:16,930 --> 00:15:18,490
It's not only your future you're ruining,

283
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:21,090
but also the Shandengting troupe's future.

284
00:15:22,330 --> 00:15:22,890
Master.

285
00:15:23,430 --> 00:15:25,970
Sis... Sister has always been the most hard-working during practice.

286
00:15:26,350 --> 00:15:28,480
It was only a small mistake today.

287
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,270
What mistake?

288
00:15:30,580 --> 00:15:32,570
I saw what happened on the stage with my own eyes.

289
00:15:33,520 --> 00:15:35,300
Others might think that you forgot your lines.

290
00:15:35,820 --> 00:15:37,340
But I know what you're capable of.

291
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:39,730
You have done thousands of shows.

292
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,340
You have never made this kind of basic mistake.

293
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:45,280
Why on earth did you do that on purpose?

294
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,380
Were you trying to change the lines on spot again?

295
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:49,890
Master.

296
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,770
Usually sister only does this to spice things up a little.

297
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,580
She knows the boundaries.

298
00:15:55,770 --> 00:15:57,550
This is against the rules. It's inappropriate.

299
00:15:58,490 --> 00:15:59,030
Yu Fei.

300
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:01,680
You really think those fans of yours

301
00:16:02,120 --> 00:16:04,170
have made you look so famous, don't you?

302
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:07,320
Have you forgotten about the four skills and five means

303
00:16:07,730 --> 00:16:09,050
that our predecessors passed on to us?

304
00:16:11,350 --> 00:16:13,370
Master, you can't hit her!

305
00:16:14,330 --> 00:16:17,750
If you do, it'll be against the the Labor Law.

306
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,440
Lanting.

307
00:16:19,370 --> 00:16:20,050
Stay out of this.

308
00:16:21,140 --> 00:16:22,270
Master is right.

309
00:16:23,880 --> 00:16:26,120
If I made a mistake, I should be punished.

310
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:29,770
But I have something

311
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,330
I want to ask.

312
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,590
Uncle.

313
00:16:42,580 --> 00:16:43,800
Did I sing well?

314
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,470
How dare you even ask uncle if you sang well?

315
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:53,170
Yang Xiaolou has a beautiful figure.

316
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:54,980
Cheng Yanqiu knows how to make use of the sleeves.

317
00:16:56,280 --> 00:16:57,690
Zhou Xinfang can put on a show just with eyes.

318
00:16:58,110 --> 00:16:59,550
They fly their own colors.

319
00:16:59,960 --> 00:17:01,700
It's because they are gifted

320
00:17:02,310 --> 00:17:03,990
and they have all worked so hard for years

321
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,660
before finally figuring it out.

322
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:07,760
What do you call it

323
00:17:08,109 --> 00:17:09,270
when you messed things up on the stage?

324
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:11,589
Sis... Sister.

325
00:17:12,170 --> 00:17:13,730
You should just admit your mistake to Master.

326
00:17:14,140 --> 00:17:14,980
How will you be able to perform

327
00:17:15,329 --> 00:17:16,710
if you keep getting punished like this?

328
00:17:16,730 --> 00:17:18,510
Sister, don't be so stubborn.

329
00:17:18,650 --> 00:17:20,030
Master is punishing you for your mistake now.

330
00:17:20,170 --> 00:17:21,480
But what he really wants is for you to learn from this.

331
00:17:23,690 --> 00:17:25,869
Master, if you're going to hit me,

332
00:17:26,380 --> 00:17:27,359
go ahead.

333
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:29,690
Yu Fei. You...

334
00:17:30,940 --> 00:17:32,740
You wanna go against me on purpose, don't you?

335
00:17:33,490 --> 00:17:34,910
Do you know how long I have not

336
00:17:35,970 --> 00:17:37,460
put the flogging our predecessors passed on

337
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:38,470
to use?

338
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,720
Do you know

339
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:42,170
what it means

340
00:17:42,700 --> 00:17:43,770

which means you're waiting for god to give you a Liu Xichan,

509
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,890
it's going to be only 1 percent success rate.

510
00:29:36,730 --> 00:29:37,660
I choose the 1 percent.

511
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,450
And,

512
00:29:40,250 --> 00:29:41,020
I will success.

513
00:29:49,340 --> 00:29:50,270
Thank you.

514
00:29:50,820 --> 00:29:52,280
This is the fine white cubilose from southeast Asia.

515
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:53,620
Tell your mom to have a try.

516
00:29:53,740 --> 00:29:55,590
The quality this time is definitely better than last time.

517
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:58,670
OK. Thank you so much.

518
00:29:59,530 --> 00:30:00,600
I don't know if it is enough.

519
00:30:02,980 --> 00:30:04,450
How old are you exactly?

520
00:30:05,280 --> 00:30:06,380
Middle-aged women are now all

521
00:30:06,410 --> 00:30:07,630
using e-payment to pay at the food market.

522
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,410
You are still binding the paper money with a rubber band.

523
00:30:10,260 --> 00:30:11,900
Is it not money when you bind it

524
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:12,830
with a rubber band?

525
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,600
A rubber band is not gonna make it less worthy.

526
00:30:15,180 --> 00:30:16,170
Fine.

527
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,190
You and I are not that distant.

528
00:30:18,690 --> 00:30:20,090
You still don't know how to use a bank card, do you?

529
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:21,520
Luckily I am not so busy later.

530
00:30:21,570 --> 00:30:22,670
I can take you to the bank.

531
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:25,100
It is the most annoying thing to come to this kind of place.

532
00:30:25,130 --> 00:30:26,890
There is no place to park my car at all.

533
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:31,010
Are those two about to leave?

534
00:30:37,150 --> 00:30:39,430
We should go.

535
00:30:39,540 --> 00:30:41,490
There are many drivers on this street waiting for a parking spot.

536
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:47,780
What's wrong?

537
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:50,450
Nothing. I'm just looking for the key.

538
00:30:52,460 --> 00:30:54,230
You always can't find anything. Hurry!

539
00:30:56,680 --> 00:30:57,410
Where is it?

540
00:30:57,850 --> 00:30:59,120
Could it be in the back again?

541
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:00,440
Last time it fell into a crack.

542
00:31:01,660 --> 00:31:03,590
How is it possible for me to make the same mistake twice?

543
00:31:04,300 --> 00:31:05,310
Maybe it is possible.

544
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,740
Hurry up. What are they doing?

545
00:31:13,570 --> 00:31:14,520
The fish is out of the bag.

546
00:31:14,550 --> 00:31:16,020
The fish's out? Let me see.

547
00:31:16,390 --> 00:31:17,160
Let me. Let me.

548
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:18,770
Be careful.

549
00:31:19,470 --> 00:31:20,660
So much water!

550
00:31:20,970 --> 00:31:22,260
- What happened?
- Be careful!

551
00:31:22,420 --> 00:31:24,020
I told you you didn't tie the bag fast.

552
00:31:24,850 --> 00:31:25,890
# - Stop moving.
- Wait. Wait.

553
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:29,410
Stop coming... Don't lay yourself on me!

554
00:31:30,180 --> 00:31:30,790
I know!

555
00:31:39,490 --> 00:31:40,440
What

556
00:31:41,830 --> 00:31:42,310
are they doing?

557
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:46,450
When are they going to stop?

558
00:31:47,130 --> 00:31:47,950
I'll go take a look.

559
00:31:49,710 --> 00:31:50,480
Be careful.

560
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:52,770
So exausted.

561
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:55,230
Why am I so unlucky

562
00:31:55,810 --> 00:31:56,510
these days?

563
00:32:05,080 --> 00:32:06,040
Are you guys in a big rush?

564
00:32:06,370 --> 00:32:07,630
Why can't you go home and do it?

565
00:32:09,320 --> 00:32:11,570
Sorry. We're in a huge rush.

566
00:32:12,810 --> 00:32:13,860
Aren't you the expensive one?

567
00:32:14,290 --> 00:32:15,390
OK. OK. OK.

568
00:32:15,850 --> 00:32:16,470
We're leaving now.

569
00:32:16,990 --> 00:32:18,530
I can see you're in a rush, too.

570
00:32:18,780 --> 00:32:19,690
You can have the spot.

571
00:32:20,550 --> 00:32:21,830
We're in the rush for different things. Hurry up.

572
00:32:21,850 --> 00:32:22,540
Don't hurt your crotch.

573
00:32:24,170 --> 00:32:25,970
Why are people so impetuous nowadays?

574
00:32:29,380 --> 00:32:30,290
Hurry up and go.

575
00:32:32,210 --> 00:32:33,120
You have it all this time?

576
00:32:34,810 --> 00:32:36,220
You lost it out there somewhere again?

577
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,720
You have been missing this and that since little.

578
00:32:39,490 --> 00:32:41,820
You're still so forgetful even now you've grown up.

579
00:32:43,060 --> 00:32:44,340
Thats why we make

580
00:32:44,370 --> 00:32:45,150
such a great team.

581
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:48,360
Nonsense.

582
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:04,150
Can you two

583
00:33:04,800 --> 00:33:05,810
finish all these foods?

584
00:33:06,390 --> 00:33:07,530
You want a free meal again?

585
00:33:10,250 --> 00:33:13,600
Recently my mom is going through her menopause.

586
00:33:14,630 --> 00:33:17,110
You don't have to stay and go through it with her.

587
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,100
Actually,

588
00:33:22,680 --> 00:33:23,770
it's not so bad to stop singing.

589
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:24,880
Why would you say so?

590
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,430
You just can't stop gloating, can you?

591
00:33:27,920 --> 00:33:28,660
No.

592
00:33:29,390 --> 00:33:30,940
You have to think from a different perspective.

593
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:32,700
There's still a long way for you to go.

594
00:33:32,730 --> 00:33:34,350
You can't just keep going in one direction.

595
00:33:35,010 --> 00:33:36,810
It's a big big world. You should go out and see things.

596
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,160
Are you trying to persuade me

597
00:33:39,190 --> 00:33:40,130
with such colorful words?

598
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:42,490
Let me tell you one more time.

599
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,670
This is called Sales.

600
00:33:45,510 --> 00:33:48,070
I am one of the best salesmen at night time

601
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,820
in the whole Suzhou, okay?

602
00:33:50,350 --> 00:33:52,480
Fine. Big salesman.

603
00:33:54,110 --> 00:33:55,770
Wait. Why didn't you sound

604
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:57,820
respectful and impressed?

605
00:33:58,400 --> 00:33:59,140
Give me.

606
00:34:05,260 --> 00:34:06,780
Right. I have arranged some work for you.

607
00:34:07,290 --> 00:34:07,910
They pay daily wages.

608
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:09,400
I'm occupied tonight.

609
00:34:09,429 --> 00:34:10,159
So I can't go with you.

610
00:34:14,739 --> 00:34:15,679
You don't need to.

611
00:34:16,070 --> 00:34:17,530
You're not going anywhere at the moment.

612
00:34:18,310 --> 00:34:19,400
Shouldn't the fine white cubilose be served

613
00:34:19,460 --> 00:34:20,330
every day to the Empress Dowager?

614
00:34:21,449 --> 00:34:22,580
There's nearly nothing

615
00:34:22,670 --> 00:34:23,710
in your cracker box, is there?

616
00:34:29,159 --> 00:34:31,010
Stop being ridiculous.

617
00:34:32,550 --> 00:34:33,989
Why would you give it back?

618
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:34,960
What are you saying?

619
00:34:37,510 --> 00:34:39,920
The money is taken as the money I borrowed from you.

620
00:34:40,900 --> 00:34:42,810
OK. Let's go with the old way.

621
00:34:42,969 --> 00:34:43,679
You can pay me back with hard work

622
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:46,690
No problem, Your Highness.

623
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:48,530
Nobody knows me better.

624
00:34:49,010 --> 00:34:50,310
Go home already. I'm going home to cook food.

625
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:16,960
Take off your shoes.

626
00:35:23,700 --> 00:35:25,500
You can be as casual as you want in the troupe.

627
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:27,180
But you're at home now.

628
00:35:29,400 --> 00:35:30,860
We're having fish tonight. I bought a fish.

629
00:35:31,930 --> 00:35:33,600
It's been more than ten days since you came back.

630
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,940
Is there no one in the troupe asking you to go back?

631
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:37,840
I asked for a leave.

632
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,810
I came back because you're in poor health.

633
00:35:41,620 --> 00:35:43,980
Also, there are so many actors in the Shandengting troupe.

634
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:44,780
They can be fine without me.

635
00:35:45,340 --> 00:35:46,610
You're good for nothing.

636
00:35:47,680 --> 00:35:49,390
You have been singing since 12.

637
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,050
Why are you still not the main pillar in the troupe?

638
00:35:52,020 --> 00:35:53,380
There's only one main pillar.

639
00:35:54,580 --> 00:35:55,780
Not everyone can be the main pillar.

640
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,180
Have you seen a stage

641
00:35:58,210 --> 00:35:59,560
that can be supported by only one pillar?

642
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:02,770
Even if there is only one pillar,

643
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,160
I sent you there so that

644
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:05,260
you could be that one pillar.

645
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:09,950
Here's the cubilose you want.

646
00:36:25,110 --> 00:36:26,820
How many times do I have to tell you

647
00:36:27,270 --> 00:36:29,460
that what I want is the Red cubilose we bought last time.

648
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:35,400
Clean the floor already.

649
00:36:35,420 --> 00:36:36,820
Don't get my treasure chest all dirty.

650
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:42,910
Right.

651
00:36:43,670 --> 00:36:45,070
What a treasure this chest is.

652
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:48,020
Don't let the ordinary cubilose

653
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:49,590
make your chest dirty.

654
00:36:51,480 --> 00:36:54,020
It still contains the treasure from the first half of your life.

655
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:58,750
Yan Peishan.

656
00:36:59,740 --> 00:37:00,810
What's happened to you?

657
00:37:02,300 --> 00:37:04,350
You wanted cubilose, so I asked someone to buy it for you.

658
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,660
Now you tell me you want a specific brand.

659
00:37:07,890 --> 00:37:10,530
You wanted to wear cheongsam, but you only wanted Taoruixiang's cheongsam.

660
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:13,100
The cheongsams from Taoruixiang are all customized.

661
00:37:13,500 --> 00:37:14,500
But you only wanted the ones off-the-rack.

662
00:37:14,530 --> 00:37:15,930
Then you shouldn't have wanted the ones from Taoruixiang.

663
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:17,950
What do you know?

664
00:37:18,020 --> 00:37:20,200
The clothes' style and material Taoruixiang has are both very fine.

665
00:37:20,630 --> 00:37:23,250
Of course I should be the one to accommodate some fine clothes.

666
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:25,720
OK.

667
00:37:26,280 --> 00:37:28,600
I have nothing to say about what you like doing.

668
00:37:29,320 --> 00:37:31,070
But if you're sick, go see a doctor, OK?

669
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:33,570
There is no one in such a small place

670
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,570
who can cure your illness of affluence.

671
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:40,250
Are you saying that I don't deserve it?

672
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:42,700
Yu Fei.

673
00:37:44,600 --> 00:37:45,560
Except the certificate of merit,

674
00:37:45,590 --> 00:37:47,250
what else have you brought home?

675
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:48,820
Since you were six,

676
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:50,220
I not only had to send you to school,

677
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,640
but also had to send you to learn opera.

678
00:37:52,150 --> 00:37:53,140
After so many years,

679
00:37:54,680 --> 00:37:56,900
I don't think I can still count on you to make me

680
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:01,460
live in ease and comfort.

681
00:38:02,930 --> 00:38:04,700
Whatever. Have it or leave it.

682
00:38:43,680 --> 00:38:44,660
If I don't go to work,

683
00:38:46,340 --> 00:38:47,730
I really won't have money to buy food.

684
00:38:57,500 --> 00:38:58,540
Hold on. Hold on.

685
00:39:00,220 --> 00:39:01,500
This is the cubilose Brother Dao bought for you.

686
00:39:01,930 --> 00:39:02,580
Thanks.

687
00:39:05,080 --> 00:39:05,920
Are you coming tomorrow?

688
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:06,850
[Yan Peishan]

689
00:39:09,730 --> 00:39:10,510
I'll come if I need money.

690
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,250
I should go. Goodbye.

691
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:18,500
[Stars are smiling in the night.]

692
00:39:16,190 --> 00:39:17,330
Guanshan has really

693
00:39:18,240 --> 00:39:19,540
never met with difficulties before.

694
00:39:20,170 --> 00:39:23,610
[Waiting for the encounter in dreams]

695
00:39:20,390 --> 00:39:21,630
I hope the world

696
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,400
can show him a lesson for once.

697
00:39:24,170 --> 00:39:24,700
For God's sake!

698
00:39:24,810 --> 00:39:26,320
[My thoughts are going away with the moonlight.]

699
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:31,080
[I blushed when the wind and the petals are in love with each other.]

700
00:39:32,250 --> 00:39:33,320
[I slept sweet and sound.]

701
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:33,980
Can I have some beer?

702
00:39:34,500 --> 00:39:37,860
[I have no idea when I fell in love with you.]

703
00:39:38,960 --> 00:39:42,680
[Do you feel the same way as me?]

704
00:39:40,980 --> 00:39:41,590
Thanks.

705
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,680
[We're getting closer and closer.]

706
00:39:46,580 --> 00:39:50,090
[Two hearts are getting closer and closer.]

707
00:39:50,970 --> 00:39:52,760
[As long as you're near,]

708
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:56,750
[until]

709
00:39:58,360 --> 00:40:01,900
[time stops at this very second.]

710
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:04,590
[I may even forget my breath and my heartbeat.]

711
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:08,220
[Trying every means,]

712
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:24,880
[I will chase you to the end of the world.]

713
00:40:28,210 --> 00:40:29,790
You know how to perform in opera, don't you?

714
00:40:37,540 --> 00:40:39,550
[Yan Peishan]

715
00:40:37,840 --> 00:40:38,840
Yan Peishan.

716
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:48,290
Can you sing what you just did there

717
00:40:48,320 --> 00:40:49,010
for one more time?

718
00:40:53,260 --> 00:40:53,910
I'll buy you drinks!

719
00:40:56,800 --> 00:40:57,290
You don't have to.

720
00:40:58,280 --> 00:41:00,470
If you wanna hear it, I'll sing for you.

721
00:41:05,940 --> 00:41:09,650
[Trying every means,]

722
00:41:10,630 --> 00:41:14,470
[I will chase you to the end of the world.]

723
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:25,120
This voice must belong to

724
00:41:25,760 --> 00:41:28,120
someone from the Shandengting that day.

725
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:37,280
Bai Feili. Where are you?

726
00:41:37,280 --> 00:41:39,360
That girl is about to get wasted.

727
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,560
Don't mess it up this time.

728
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:44,040
Also,

729
00:41:44,040 --> 00:41:46,440
today's bills all go to the company.

730
00:41:51,600 --> 00:41:53,120
Where is she?

731
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:35,680
Uncle.

732
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:45,320
Eventually

733
00:42:46,280 --> 00:42:48,400
you're here to take me back.

734
00:42:54,200 --> 00:42:55,880
Uncle.

735
00:42:56,800 --> 00:42:58,480
Was my singing

736
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,000
so bad?

737
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:05,440
What?

738
00:43:08,040 --> 00:43:09,600
What are you talking about?

739
00:43:16,440 --> 00:43:18,120
Wrong person.

740
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:22,960
Tell me.

741
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:26,840
Why is

742
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,840
the trash can so tall?

743
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,160
As long as you shake your head

744
00:43:39,160 --> 00:43:41,360
to make sure you won't vomit, I will let go of my hand.

745
00:43:54,960 --> 00:43:56,920
Take me home.
