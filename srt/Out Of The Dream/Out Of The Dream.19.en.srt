are you going to send it to me?

I've take the temperature.

Then take it once more.

The, the amusement park...

Besides the amusement park,

What's it?

108
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,920
Soybean soup.

109
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,960
I've been looking for the soybean soup 
 for a whole afternoon

110
00:06:53,960 --> 00:06:55,120
and bought it.

111
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,680
It's definitely not this.

112
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:57,320
Yes, it is.

113
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,120
Tell me now. 
 Where are you going to have it?

114
00:06:58,120 --> 00:06:58,680
Tell me.

115
00:06:58,680 --> 00:06:59,680
Are you going to have it here? 
 Tell me or not?

116
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:01,160
I will tickle you if you don't tell me.

117
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,240
Tell me now! Will you?

118
00:07:06,280 --> 00:07:07,560
And

119
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:11,280
welcome to my world.

But you're still running a fever.

123

You have to...

124
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,240
I'm sorry

125
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,920
I told you that

126
00:07:40,200 --> 00:07:41,600
I wanted to know

127

your fragility and secrets.

128
00:07:45,600 --> 00:07:47,880
I said I would accept them

129
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:51,159
but I didn't behave well.

130
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:56,960
Uncle is very important to me.

131
00:07:58,840 --> 00:08:00,680
Because just like the Shangdengting Troupe,

132
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,760
he is a guide

133
00:08:03,760 --> 00:08:05,960
in my life.

134
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,880
They've lit up my life

135
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:12,320
and helped me find my way.

136
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,720
So I appreciate their help forever.

137
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:19,840
But I also know

138
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:22,040
there's a long way to go

139
00:08:22,480 --> 00:08:24,800
in one's life,

140
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:29,200
and I will meet different lighthouses.

141
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,960
Actually,

142
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
whether you're the lion or not,

143
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:37,919
it doesn't matter.

144
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,039
Because it's you, that's enough.

145
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,480
My only wish is that

146
00:08:48,120 --> 00:08:49,800
we can move forward

147
00:08:50,280 --> 00:08:52,760
together step by step.

00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,560
My only wish is that

149
00:08:56,600 --> 00:08:58,880
I can protect you

150
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:02,920
whenever you need me.

151
00:09:13,560 --> 00:09:14,760
That's ok,

152
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:17,800
and,

153
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,320
thank you.

154
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:26,000
As the lion,

155
00:09:26,360 --> 00:09:27,680
or anything else,

156
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:30,920
you've protected me for a long time.

157
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:33,880
It makes me

158
00:09:34,920 --> 00:09:36,920
feel less scared.

159
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:40,840
All right.

160
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:42,040
You're still stick,

00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:43,480
so go to bed early.

162

I have one more question that

163
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,080
I've wanted to ask you for a while.

165
00:09:51,240 --> 00:09:53,800

348
00:23:15,440 --> 00:23:17,800
Yes, the business is

349
00:23:18,080 --> 00:23:20,040
getting more and more difficult.

350
00:23:20,880 --> 00:23:23,640
Like humans,

351
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,360
art has its own destiny.

352
00:23:26,360 --> 00:23:27,720
Young people

353
00:23:28,120 --> 00:23:30,200
like fast fashion.

354
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:32,160
They like to cheer up.

355
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,560
Get party, you know.

356
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:37,040
Is your business

357
00:23:37,040 --> 00:23:38,400
following the fashion?

358
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,000
Just for fun. It can't begin in earnest.

359
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,200
But people like it, right?

360

the era of traditional arts

363

What do you think?

368
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:05,440
Well, it seems

369
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:07,400
you have another plan.

370
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:11,400
Traditional arts

371
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,000
need to be inherited

372
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:14,360
and developed.

there is a young senior male actress

I'm sorry, elder sister.

420

It doesn't matter. I know you were not on purpose.

421
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,480
Come this way, clean your hands.

422
00:26:48,040 --> 00:26:49,400
Go.

423
00:26:51,400 --> 00:26:52,720
I'm sorry.

00:26:57,320 --> 00:26:58,360
You are?

426
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:00,840
Xiao Dao is waiting for us.

427
00:27:00,840 --> 00:27:02,040
Let's go and eat something together.

428
00:27:03,680 --> 00:27:05,080
This way, please.

429
00:27:10,760 --> 00:27:12,760
This is my boss, Mr Lou.

430
00:27:11,720 --> 00:27:12,580
[Lou's capital Lou Shitang]

431
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,240
I'm also Xiao Dao's friend.

432
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,960
I'm sorry for what happened.

433
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,320
Never mind.

434
00:27:21,160 --> 00:27:22,400
These kids

435
00:27:22,840 --> 00:27:24,960
have special families.

436
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,760
Like Xiao Xian,

437
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,920
his parents abandoned him

438
00:27:27,920 --> 00:27:29,200
since he was born.

439
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,440
He grew up with his uncle.

440
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,160
It's hard for him

441
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,160
to fill himself with food everyday.

442
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:37,240
Other kids often bully him.

443
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,160
So compared with the kids at his age,

444
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,040
he may be more vigilant.

445
00:27:42,280 --> 00:27:44,040
Enjoy yourselves, kids.

446
00:27:45,880 --> 00:27:46,680
Come here,

447
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,200
Lao Xia.

448
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,160
Lao Xia is an old friend.

449
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,600
He is the owner of the restaurant. I told him

450
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:54,880
these kids would come here every Monday.

451
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,240
So we hold a charity activity every Monday

452
00:27:56,920 --> 00:27:58,600
to help these kids

453
00:27:58,600 --> 00:27:59,840
get full.

454
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:00,960
Yes, every Monday.

455
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,000
It seems good.

456
00:28:03,400 --> 00:28:03,840
Enjoy yourselves.

457
00:28:03,840 --> 00:28:05,160
Ok, keep your business.

458
00:28:07,800 --> 00:28:09,360
But I don't think it's enough

459
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:10,840
for the kids just to get full.

460
00:28:10,840 --> 00:28:12,000
I think

461
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:12,720
we should help them

462
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,840
behave well

463
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:14,720
and then

464
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:17,680
learn something useful.

465
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,200
I think Peking Opera

466
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,720
is suitable for them.

467
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:23,520
So I asked Xiao Dao

468
00:28:23,520 --> 00:28:24,960
to invite you here.

469
00:28:25,640 --> 00:28:26,400
I'm afraid if Miss Yu

470
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:27,760
is available on holidays

471
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:30,200
to teach them Peking Opera?

472
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:32,400
I didn't expect it.

473
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,840
Well, I...

474
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,360
I've heard Yu Fei

475
00:28:38,360 --> 00:28:39,960
from Shandengting Troupe for a long time.

476
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:43,560
Mr Lou, actually

477
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:46,080
I've been expelled from Shandengting Troupe.

478
00:28:47,480 --> 00:28:50,240
Yu Fei just passed the entrance exam 
 of Academy of Traditional Opera,

479
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:51,640
so she is pressured with a lot of homework.

480
00:28:51,640 --> 00:28:53,720
Besides, her teachers are strict.

481
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:55,600
But relax, Mr Lou.

482
00:28:56,480 --> 00:28:59,280
Yu Fei is a caring girl

483
00:28:59,280 --> 00:29:01,680
and she is willing to help others.

484
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,840
When she finishes her homework,

485
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:05,520
I'll take her to you.

486
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,560
Congrats. Sorry to disturb you.

487
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:11,120
By the way,

488
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,960
you're studying in Academy of Traditional Opera,

489
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:15,760
so are you acting in the

490
00:29:15,760 --> 00:29:17,320
Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period?

491
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:19,000
I know it.

492
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:21,040
Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period is

493
00:29:21,040 --> 00:29:22,680
another masterpiece of Nan Huaiming ten years later.

494
00:29:22,920 --> 00:29:24,000
It is a great event

495
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,160
in the opera community.

496
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,560
But I'm a freshman,

497
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,560
I don't think I'm qualified to apply for it.

498
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,240
Well, Bao Nan.

499
00:29:35,000 --> 00:29:36,720
Miss Yu is so gifted,

500
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:39,360
I think it's a pity if you don't participate.

501
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:40,400
How about this?

502
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:41,760
If you don't mind,

503
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:43,160
I'll communicate with Mr Nan.

504
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,920
No, thank you,

505
00:29:44,920 --> 00:29:45,560
Mr Lou.

506
00:29:45,880 --> 00:29:47,600
Thank you all the same, but please don't.

507
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:51,600
I see.

508
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:52,840
Artists like you

509
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,960
don't like to be connected with business.

510
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,280
I understand.

511
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,440
She'd like to, very much.

512
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:02,200
Yu Fei

513
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,240
likes making friends too.

514
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:06,200
Then on behalf of Yu Fei, thank you, Mr Lou.

515
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:08,440
You're welcome. 
 Thank you.

516
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:12,320
Come on, Miss Yu.

517
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,480
Let's get started.

518
00:30:13,760 --> 00:30:16,560

Don't you think it's a little hollow?

560

Being born with a dream, and dying for hunting the dream,

561
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:08,880
and reviving for realizing the dream.

562
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:10,760
The Peony Pavilion is

00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:11,960
only one story

564
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:13,320
of Linchuan four dreams.

565
00:32:13,800 --> 00:32:15,360
For us, we spend the whole life

our new Dream of the South.

574
00:32:32,560 --> 00:32:34,600
In our story,

575
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:36,040
the scholar comes into the dream for three times,

576
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:38,440
which draws together his love 
 with Liu Xichan for three generations.

577
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:40,640
In the last generation,

578
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,160
the scholar meets a choice.

579
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:46,520
Should he leave the palace

580
00:32:46,800 --> 00:32:49,120
and run away with Liu Xichan at night?

581
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,680
Or should he take everything

582
00:32:51,680 --> 00:32:53,160
as a dream?

583
00:32:53,960 --> 00:32:55,480
The comic ends here.

we have to make a breakthrough.

587
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:06,120
So it's a story combining dream and reality,

588
00:33:06,720 --> 00:33:09,080
and it's about a dream chaser.

691
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,560
actually I have my reasons

692
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:20,800
to do this.

693
00:37:21,480 --> 00:37:22,680
Your father

694

695
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,200

696

he's worth sympathy.

Mrs Shan,

702
00:37:39,280 --> 00:37:41,680
I don't think he wants to see me.

703
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,480

704
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,200
on his birthday.

705

For some people,

706
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:51,440
the connection between parents and their kids

707
00:37:51,640 --> 00:37:53,720
is tight,

708
00:37:53,720 --> 00:37:56,040
while for others, it's not.

709

We know your father.

710

He is firm in speech

711

but soft in heart.

it's the time.

716
00:38:13,960 --> 00:38:14,920

720

He really cares about you.

721
00:38:23,360 --> 00:38:24,560
He tries to be nice,

722
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:26,800
but he doesn't know how to do it.

723
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:29,000
He doesn't know whether you can accept it or not.

724
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:30,480
So every month,

725
