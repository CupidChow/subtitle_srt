1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:10,000
[English subtitles are available]

2
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,440
At the patient's own request,

3
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:44,520
he wants to confide in you himself.

4
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:46,160
As for the rest,

5
00:01:46,160 --> 00:01:47,800
it's all in the letter.

6
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,520
But as a psychiatrist,

7
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:57,039
I want to make it clear to you that

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,080
mental illnesses

9
00:01:59,080 --> 00:02:01,920
are the same as physical illnesses like colds and fevers.

10
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:05,280
Don't think of it as something odd.

11
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:07,920
Our patient

12
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:10,320
keeps it a secret

13
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:12,400
because he's afraid of

14
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
prejudiced eyes.

15
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:17,680
But

16
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:19,600
Xiao Bai trusted you so much.

17
00:02:20,320 --> 00:02:22,800
You must have done well enough

18
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,200
to enter his world.

19
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:27,600
As his attending,

20
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,640
I want to thank you.

21
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:33,440
Thank you, doc.

22
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,600
Who're you?

23
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:15,160
I know it's not a funny way to start.

24
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:16,960
But at least

25
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:18,440
it can make this letter

26
00:03:19,480 --> 00:03:21,640
less like a suicide note looking back on my life.

27
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:24,280
My mother

28
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:26,680
was a rising star in the Beijing Opera circle.

29
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,640
She was once famous for her role as Yu Ji,

30
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:31,920
attracting countless audiences.

31
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,040
My father Bai Juyuan

32
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:36,280
was one of them.

33
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:39,320
Unfortunately, their love

34
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,240
was eventually worn away by the trifles of life.

35
00:03:42,760 --> 00:03:44,720
My father got busier and busier,

36
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:46,880
and spent less and less time

37
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:48,440
at home.

38
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,120
One table.

39
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:53,240
Three meals.

40
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:57,240
But dad's meal

41
00:03:57,920 --> 00:03:59,600
was never eaten.

42
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,440
My mother had been depressed

43
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,640
since I was born.

44
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:08,960
It became more and more difficult

45
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:10,960
for her to heal,

46
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,080
like a broken glass.

47
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:16,240
For a long, long time,

48
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,040
I hadn't seen

49
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:18,800
her smile.

50
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:21,959
I could no longer feel

51
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:25,040
the whole happy planet she gave me

52
00:04:25,320 --> 00:04:28,400
as she held me in her arms.

53
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,159
When I was in primary school,

54
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,640
my classmates often laughed at me for looking like a girl.

55
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:38,800
In the graduation performance, they deliberately asked me to play the role of a girl.

56
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:41,640
I wept it out to my mother,

57
00:04:42,760 --> 00:04:44,440
and I remember

58
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:46,120
everything

59
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,640
she said then.

60
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,640
In the operas I sung,

61
00:04:49,640 --> 00:04:51,360
boys can play Dan,

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,400
and senior roles can be played by girls.

63
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:55,920
In the world of art,

64
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,920
beauty has nothing to do with gender.

65
00:04:58,360 --> 00:04:59,640
Those who laugh at you

66
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:00,880
are cowards

67
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,360
and do not understand beauty.

68
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:05,080
My boy, Xiao Bai,

69
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,400
should be brave.

70
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,640
You deserve to be

71
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:10,680
the most beautiful Ophelia in the graduation yearbook.

72
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,600
Even if you are a princess,

73
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,680
you will always be the best

74
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:18,360
in my eyes.

75
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:23,920
The graduation performance was a success,

76
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:25,440
and I was happy.

77
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:28,040
I didn't expect that

78
00:05:28,640 --> 00:05:29,920
it was the last straw

79
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,720
breaking my family.

80
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,920
Dad flew into a rage

81
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:36,440
because I was wearing a dress.

82
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:38,440
That was the first time

83
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:39,560
mom knew

84
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,120
dad was seeing someone else.

85
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,360
The jigsaw puzzle of the family

86
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,840
was completely loose

87
00:05:47,040 --> 00:05:48,040
and falling.

88
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:22,480
After that,

89
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,680
dad brought a strange aunt to our home.

90
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,120
At the same time, I began to hear voices in the closet

91
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,159
and see my mother in her costume

92
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,720
walking around the house.

93
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,560
I told dad about this.

94
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,640
But he sent me to the hospital.

95
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,800
After taking those colored pills in the hospital,

96
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:45,440
I could not see my mother.

97
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,320
I was the same as my mother at that time,

98
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:50,720
felt no joys or sorrows.

99
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:54,840
Then I went to Zhan Garden.

100
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:56,920
I also got regular psychological counseling

101
00:06:56,920 --> 00:06:58,880
in addition to medication.

102
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,200
I told myself,

103
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,480
for the sake of mother,

104
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,040
I will try to be

105
00:07:05,040 --> 00:07:05,520
a braver

106
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:06,960
and stronger person.

107
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,440
I just didn't have the confidence.

108
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:13,520
Can the runway for myself alone

109
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:17,800
have a different end with my mother's?

110
00:07:35,159 --> 00:07:36,480
You're different.

111
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,080
You've always been brave

112
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:40,840
and relaxed,

113
00:07:41,760 --> 00:07:43,760
with an uncompromising instinct.

114
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,560
I believe

115
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:47,880
the same is true for family love.

116
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:51,480
Wherever she is,

117
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:55,240
she's in our hearts.

118
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,120
You're never surprised

119
00:07:58,120 --> 00:07:59,520
by my vulnerability.

120
00:08:00,840 --> 00:08:02,160
Don't go.

121
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,680
I'm here.

122
00:08:10,680 --> 00:08:12,760
You didn't try to break my shell,

123
00:08:14,480 --> 00:08:16,160
you just kept telling me

124
00:08:17,160 --> 00:08:18,480
it's okay.

125
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,080
I have a disease

126
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,240
that makes me very afraid of

127
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:27,840
some certain things.

128
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,640
Is that a disease?

129
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,200
Even a superhero

130
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,440
must be afraid of some things.

131
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,440
Because of you,

132
00:08:36,280 --> 00:08:38,840
the fears that had overwhelmed me

133
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,679
didn't seem so terrible anymore.

134
00:08:43,559 --> 00:08:45,280
I hope to

135
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,560
go step by step

136
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,400
with you.

137
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,160
I hope that

138
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,360
I can protect you

139
00:08:59,720 --> 00:09:01,320
when you need me.

140
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:04,120
I was gratified

141
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:05,760
but

142
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:07,720
new fears rose.

143
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,320
Can I protect you?

144
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:13,840
Will you accept

145
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,200
all of me?

146
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:19,560
Can I

147
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,160
take you

148
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:25,400
to the world beyond the runway?

149
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,120
What are you doing?

150
00:09:28,960 --> 00:09:30,040
I...

151
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:32,360
I'm writing about

152
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:35,760
how my assets will be divided

153
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,320
if something

154
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,240
happens to me.

155
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,200
The props in Jiubai

156
00:09:44,520 --> 00:09:46,120
and comic books?

157
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:50,120
Well... As for the South Song,

158
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:52,080
I wonder if you could leave it to me.

159
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:53,760
I

160
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:56,160
will leave them to Cang.

161
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:00,720
Agreed.

162
00:10:02,600 --> 00:10:03,400
Well...

163
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,320
I wonder if

164
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,800
you could leave yourself to me.

165
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:11,960
How's that?

166
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,920
If I ask you to stay with me

167
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,240
and never leave,

168
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:32,360
would it be too much pressure for you?

169
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,600
You're the biggest surprise of my life.

170
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:39,720
Because of you,

171
00:10:40,360 --> 00:10:42,480
I am no longer strong.

172
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:45,120
I'm scared

173
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,080
even at the happiest times.

174
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,080
This second

175
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:51,120
is running out.

176
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:12,520
It's very brave of you

177
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:17,120
to make it this far.

178
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:22,120
But don't be selfish

179
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:26,600
in the future.

180
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,760
No matter who you are,

181
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:35,120
if you feel tired,

182
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:39,480
let me share your woe,

183
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,960
okay?

184
00:11:58,280 --> 00:11:59,760
You used to be in the training room

185
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:01,600
at this hour.

186
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,120
What's wrong with you today?

187
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:05,000
After you was invited to Talking Stage,

188
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:07,240
you think you have mastered your skills

189
00:12:07,240 --> 00:12:09,080
and need no practice, don't you?

190
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,560
Mr. Nan,

191
00:12:10,960 --> 00:12:12,920
I have something to tell you.

192
00:12:13,080 --> 00:12:14,040
Go ahead.

193
00:12:15,560 --> 00:12:16,600
I was able to get

194
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,640
the opportunity of acting in Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period

195
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:20,160
because of Lou Shi...

196
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:23,440
because of Mr. Lou.

197
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:26,840
You were right.

198
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:28,520
I pulled some strings.

199
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
If I act on stage due to the shortcut,

200
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:33,640
I won't even deserve to be a training partner.

201
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,080
So

202
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:39,680
I want to quit the rehearsal.

203
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,080
I appreciate your kindness.

204
00:12:43,080 --> 00:12:45,640
There will be ample time.

205
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:48,440
I hope we can work together again.

206
00:12:48,880 --> 00:12:50,960
I wish you all the best.

207
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:55,480
There's nothing I can do with you.

208
00:12:55,480 --> 00:12:58,760
You've been rebelling too long.

209
00:12:58,760 --> 00:13:02,000
I didn't want to hire senior female roles.

210
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:03,520
I kept you around so long,

211
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:04,320
because

212
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,280
you kept proving to me

213
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,440
what you could do. Do you understand?

214
00:13:08,680 --> 00:13:11,160
Even so, I don't want it to be because of Mr. Lou.

215
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,080
Wait, stop, stop, stop.

216
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:14,720
Who told you

217
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:17,000
it was Lou Shitang that recommended you?

218
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,800
I think it's good.

219
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:31,320
It still needs some changes.

220
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:33,800
What changes?

221
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,640
Guanjiu.

222
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:00,960
Your mouth...

223
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:02,160
Mouth?

224
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:03,480
What's wrong with my mouth?

225
00:14:13,280 --> 00:14:15,920
Are you two...

226
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,760
Nothing happened between us.

227
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:27,520
Nothing happened between us.

228
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,200
Zhuang Sheng.

229
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:35,480
It's your turn.

230
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:45,320
Hao Shi, you neglect neither work nor love.

231
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,920
Nice.

232
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,880
Guanjiu.

233
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:53,400
Are we going public with our relationship?

234
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,040
Of course not.

235
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:56,120
Just do your work.

236
00:14:56,640 --> 00:14:57,360
Okay.

237
00:14:58,800 --> 00:15:01,600
Daydream Space, a shrine for rehearsal.

238
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,760
Here comes milk tea for all of you.

239
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,960
I wonder if someone could move this box.

240
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,640
I... Let me, let me. Have some rest.

241
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:11,040
Or I'm afraid there won't be enough room when guests arrive.

242
00:15:18,280 --> 00:15:20,000
If it weren't for this bright-eyes makeup,

243
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,520
I would have fallen asleep.

244
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:23,040
Do my makeup next time.

245
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:23,680
Okay.

246
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,880
I'll wait for you next time.

247
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:43,680
This pumpkin

248
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:45,800
is pretty good.

249
00:15:46,360 --> 00:15:48,320
I can't believe he's going to Tom Ford's alma mater.

250
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,720
Thank you.

251
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,160
This little gift is a token of my regard.

252
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,760
Thank you

253
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:03,760
for recommending me for Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period.

254
00:16:07,240 --> 00:16:08,640
You're welcome.

255
00:16:09,520 --> 00:16:11,400
It's nothing.

256
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:14,760
We just think Nan Huaiming

257
00:16:14,760 --> 00:16:16,440
is getting old.

258
00:16:16,440 --> 00:16:18,720
We were afraid he wouldn't be able to find you in the crowd,

259
00:16:18,920 --> 00:16:21,720
so we just pushed it.

260
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:23,480
Thank you.

261
00:16:26,680 --> 00:16:28,600
Is Bai Feili okay,

262
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,320
after he's discharged from hospital?

263
00:16:30,720 --> 00:16:31,520
He's good.

264
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,160
In fact, we are very experienced

265
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,800
in dealing with his situation.

266
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:38,240
Only this time...

267
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:44,040
Yu, thank you.

268
00:16:44,200 --> 00:16:47,440
Maybe it was because you helped him

269
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,360
that he started

270
00:16:49,360 --> 00:16:51,640
receiving help and treatment,

271
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:53,640
instead of

272
00:16:53,640 --> 00:16:55,240
forcing himself to bite the bullet.

273
00:16:56,640 --> 00:16:57,560
Thank you.

274
00:16:59,520 --> 00:17:01,160
If it wasn't for you,

275
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,480
I probably

276
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:05,119
wouldn't have met him,

277
00:17:05,920 --> 00:17:07,359
and he wouldn't have

278
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,920
walked up to me.

279
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,520
You must be the world's

280
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:13,520
most powerful grandparents,

281
00:17:14,480 --> 00:17:15,960
so that Bai Feili

282
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,119
can grow up smoothly.

283
00:17:19,200 --> 00:17:20,200
Yu,

284
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:21,640
anyway,

285
00:17:21,800 --> 00:17:23,520
you're the key to Bai Feili's

286
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:25,839
recovery right now.

287
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,119
Yes.

288
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:51,760
It's me.

289
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:56,680
You don't have to open the door.

290
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,200
I just want to

291
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,400
sit here for a while.

292
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,240
Today

293
00:18:43,640 --> 00:18:45,240
I came with

294
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
the star launcher.

295
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:55,840
I want to

296
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:57,320
talk to it here.

297
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:01,760
Knock on the door

298
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,280
if you agree,

299
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,520
and we'll be on the same page.

300
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:18,560
Sorry.

301
00:19:21,600 --> 00:19:22,400
I

302
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:25,840
speak

303
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:28,440
slowly now.

304
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:30,800
Don't worry.

305
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,480
It's because of the medicine.

306
00:19:36,440 --> 00:19:37,240
I

307
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:38,360
want

308
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,080
to

309
00:19:41,720 --> 00:19:42,920
hug you.

310
00:19:50,760 --> 00:19:52,240
Does your hand

311
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:56,240
still hurt?

312
00:20:23,040 --> 00:20:24,640
It's okay now.

313
00:20:29,720 --> 00:20:31,360
You don't have to do anything.

314
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:34,640
I'm gonna focus on

315
00:20:35,040 --> 00:20:36,640
talking to the star.

316
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:41,520
Star,

317
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:45,160
don't be angry with me.

318
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:50,520
Some time ago,

319
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:54,200
I had a quarrel with Bai Feili,

320
00:20:55,760 --> 00:20:58,080
and took back his right of using star

321
00:20:58,840 --> 00:21:01,280
without his knowledge.

322
00:21:03,160 --> 00:21:04,320
Because of this,

323
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:09,880
I missed so many of his secrets.

324
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,720
But somehow,

325
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,520
with his gifts,

326
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,720
he became the one

327
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,400
who understood me the best.

328
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,200
But now I know

329
00:21:27,480 --> 00:21:29,400
what he's afraid of.

330
00:21:33,000 --> 00:21:33,960
Maybe

331
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:37,680
it was a kind of schadenfreude.

332
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,960
But now I finally have

333
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,760
a whole Bai Feili.

334
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:52,040
When I hug him,

335
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,960
I no longer have to be cautious,

336
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:58,880
afraid of touching his wound.

337
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:03,960
The face of it

338
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,120
is the beginning of healing.

339
00:22:13,680 --> 00:22:16,120
That's what Bai Feili taught me.

340
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:22,200
I can protect you.

341
00:23:22,880 --> 00:23:23,880
This time,

342
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:26,120
let me protect you.

343
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,720
I will protect you

344
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,040
and accompany you.

345
00:23:32,920 --> 00:23:33,880
Yes.

346
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:16,760
Sis,

347
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:18,520
I made the boots.

348
00:25:19,280 --> 00:25:20,360
There you are.

349
00:25:21,280 --> 00:25:22,080
Come and try them on.

350
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,080
So soon?

351
00:25:26,920 --> 00:25:28,600
Good for you.

352
00:25:29,040 --> 00:25:31,240
Hao Shi, you've grown up.

353
00:25:31,480 --> 00:25:34,160
Only my Guanjiu can pet me.

354
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:40,000
Little kid, are you fledged?

355
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,600
After you go to Parsons,

356
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:47,120
call home more often.

357
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:48,840
I'm not going.

358
00:25:49,000 --> 00:25:50,800
Now it is a difficult time for Jiubai.

359
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:51,720
I want to stay here

360
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:53,400
and face the difficulties together with Guanjiu.

361
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:01,680
Guanjiu is top 2.

362
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:04,000
If you don't study in the famous school

363
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:05,280
and make a name for yourself,

364
00:26:05,280 --> 00:26:07,160
no one will want to face difficulties with you.

365
00:26:08,560 --> 00:26:10,600
Anyway, I'll figure it out for myself.

366
00:26:11,280 --> 00:26:12,720
I'm not a kid anymore.

367
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,760
What pictures are you taking? What's the point?

368
00:26:34,320 --> 00:26:35,720
You don't understand.

369
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:58,280
This is the sky today.

370
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,320
The little sun is my gift to you.

371
00:27:00,800 --> 00:27:01,680
You're welcome.

372
00:27:23,560 --> 00:27:26,320
Some loves are wrong,

373
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:27,720
but the lovers are destined to be

374
00:27:27,960 --> 00:27:28,880
a couple.

375
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:52,360
Next one, Li Shaoyan.

376
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:17,840
It's good to have competition.

377
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,240
Even you have the sense of crisis now.

378
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:21,040
Good.

379
00:28:23,200 --> 00:28:24,880
Okay. Let's call it a day.

380
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,880
We'll have the final election by the end of next month.

381
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:29,400
Please be there on time.

382
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:30,680
Let's call it a day.

383
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:32,240
Okay. Thank you.

384
00:28:32,240 --> 00:28:32,880
Let's go.

385
00:29:24,720 --> 00:29:26,520
Well... Thank you.

386
00:29:26,520 --> 00:29:28,440
Next time character A will be decided.

387
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,720
We'll see what happens on the stage.

388
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:32,400
Seriously,

389
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:33,800
you're the best match

390
00:29:33,800 --> 00:29:34,840
I've ever had.

391
00:29:48,560 --> 00:29:50,280
How are you doing, Miss Yu?

392
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:52,000
Are you free for a chat tonight?

393
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:23,600
The fourth fusion of Rock.

394
00:30:23,600 --> 00:30:25,480
Miss Yu, have a try.

395
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:26,960
No need.

396
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:32,400
This is yours.

397
00:30:32,600 --> 00:30:33,440
I gotta go.

398
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:37,880
Miss Yu, you seem to

399
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:39,680
have grown up a lot lately.

400
00:30:40,360 --> 00:30:42,000
It's only been a while.

401
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,360
I thought you were a high-minded person,

402
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:48,440
but I didn't expect you to attach yourself to

403
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:50,120
the son of Shang&Shan Group.

404
00:30:52,160 --> 00:30:54,960
Man struggles upwards; water flows downwards.

405
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,200
It's human nature.

406
00:30:58,200 --> 00:30:59,320
I just think

407
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:00,720
it's a shame.

408
00:31:01,120 --> 00:31:02,600
You don't seem to

409
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,240
have a very good taste.

410
00:31:04,840 --> 00:31:07,040
In terms of opera actors, you loved Ni Lin,

411
00:31:08,320 --> 00:31:10,680
who has a handsome appearance

412
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:13,040
but is pedantic and boring.

413
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:15,680
Shandengting is about to close down.

414
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,120
The money needed was sent to him.

415
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,760
But he sent it back intact.

416
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:23,280
Out of opera,

417
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:25,240
you love Bai Feili,

418
00:31:26,400 --> 00:31:28,560
a boy having no bright future.

419
00:31:29,720 --> 00:31:31,120
Well, before,

420
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:33,160
he could rely on his family.

421
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:35,320
But now Bai Juyuan

422
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:36,760
will be put in prison.

423
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:38,600
Without his father

424
00:31:39,600 --> 00:31:41,480
and Shang&Shan Group,

425
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,400
you tell me,

426
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:45,960
what else can he do?

427
00:31:55,000 --> 00:31:56,200
What are you trying to say?

428
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,200
I've always looked up to you, Miss Yu.

429
00:32:05,360 --> 00:32:07,200
But that also depends on

430
00:32:07,720 --> 00:32:09,200
whether you take this quill.

431
00:32:16,040 --> 00:32:17,440
I'm a good judge of character.

432
00:32:18,760 --> 00:32:20,160
I don't usually let go of

433
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,000
things I like.

434
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,120
Just like

435
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:25,920
when we first met,

436
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,760
I believe we're the same kind of person,

437
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:31,520
a person who needs to succeed,

438
00:32:31,800 --> 00:32:33,240
a person who wants to succeed,

439
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:35,240
a person who's willing to do

440
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,840
whatever it takes to succeed.

441
00:32:37,840 --> 00:32:38,640
And you

442
00:32:39,640 --> 00:32:40,720
are the one

443
00:32:40,920 --> 00:32:42,280
who can succeed.

444
00:32:43,600 --> 00:32:45,240
So like I said,

445
00:32:46,040 --> 00:32:47,520
I'll give you a leg up

446
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:49,600
to help you succeed.

447
00:32:53,720 --> 00:32:56,040
You'll give me a leg up

448
00:32:57,000 --> 00:32:59,240
to help me succeed.

449
00:33:06,800 --> 00:33:07,840
What then?

450
00:33:09,320 --> 00:33:11,400
Like charity and Peking Opera,

451
00:33:11,560 --> 00:33:14,280
I'll become another tool of your snobbery.

452
00:33:17,080 --> 00:33:17,920
Sorry,

453
00:33:18,560 --> 00:33:20,040
you may have the wrong person.

454
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:23,160
I don't need anyone to give me a leg up.

455
00:33:23,720 --> 00:33:25,080
Because I am who I am.

456
00:33:25,600 --> 00:33:27,200
I'm Yu Fei.

457
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:31,120
I don't need any help from anyone else.

458
00:33:31,640 --> 00:33:33,000
Because my voice

459
00:33:33,000 --> 00:33:34,360
is loud enough.

460
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:38,000
Do you just want to watch

461
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:40,000
Shandengting close down and do nothing?

462
00:33:42,520 --> 00:33:44,360
Shandengting won't close down.

463
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:46,720
What about Shang&Shan Group?

464
00:33:49,560 --> 00:33:51,160
Let me tell you

465
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,440
why Bai Feili came to me the other day,

466
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,920
and why he was willing to

467
00:33:57,080 --> 00:33:58,400
sing for my party at home.

468
00:33:59,600 --> 00:34:01,640
Because the fate of Shang&Shan Group

469
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,640
and the future of his father

470
00:34:05,640 --> 00:34:07,720
are under my control.

471
00:34:09,960 --> 00:34:11,280
So

472
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:15,480
you used Bai Feili's father as bait

473
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:16,600
to lure him there,

474
00:34:17,000 --> 00:34:18,360
and humiliated him in public.

475
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:24,400
You treat art like a toy for fun.

476
00:34:25,199 --> 00:34:27,159
Is that your so-called "leg up"?

477
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,480
I think you know nothing about art,

478
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:33,159
much less love.

479
00:34:33,719 --> 00:34:34,400
Love?

480
00:34:36,880 --> 00:34:38,159
Love is

481
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:39,480
when there is mutual benefit.

482
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,920
You mean one-sided use and destruction.

483
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:46,040
That's a loser's excuse

484
00:34:46,239 --> 00:34:47,840
for himself.

485
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,040
Only those who succeed

486
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,880
can see the beautiful world.

487
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,320
So

488
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,640
you already knew what happened to Bai Feili.

489
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,480
He's got that disease,

490
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:05,160
but still forced himself to do that.

491
00:35:07,120 --> 00:35:07,960
I didn't expect that

492
00:35:07,960 --> 00:35:08,600
he really plunged

493
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:09,960
his sword.

494
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:19,160
You don't deserve to mention Bai Feili's name.

495
00:35:24,200 --> 00:35:25,760
Do you think you can leave here?

496
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:26,960
She can.

497
00:36:20,640 --> 00:36:22,400
She is the daughter of professor Shang in our department.

498
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:23,880
Freshman girl.

499
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,000
Pretty, huh?

500
00:36:27,600 --> 00:36:28,840
Don't you often write poetry?

501
00:36:28,840 --> 00:36:29,920
Let me borrow it.

502
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:33,720
Your lunch is on me all semester.

503
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:42,440
All semester.

504
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:08,280
Hello there.

505
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:09,040
Hello.

506
00:38:01,920 --> 00:38:03,120
I regret it.

507
00:38:04,680 --> 00:38:05,960
I thought

508
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:07,680
I could see you from a distance.

509
00:38:09,840 --> 00:38:11,480
It's my fault.

510
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,280
I shouldn't have let him have you.

511
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:18,880
I

512
00:38:18,880 --> 00:38:22,680
am gonna make Bai pay.

513
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:42,360
Boss.

514
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:50,720
Mr. Lou.

515
00:38:50,920 --> 00:38:52,240
Why did you let them go?

516
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:54,520
You're still here?

517
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:57,640
I'll

518
00:38:57,840 --> 00:38:58,840
take care of it.

519
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,480
It's really a good thing.

520
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:06,720
A thing everyone likes.

521
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,440
Isn't it reasonable
