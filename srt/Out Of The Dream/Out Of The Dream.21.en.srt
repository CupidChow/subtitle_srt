511
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:06,880
when I was in school,

512
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:09,120
I wanted to be Madame Curie of China,

513
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:12,000
so I never thought about getting married.

514
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,080
or having children,

515
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:14,440
or my children having children

516
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,040
or something like that.

517
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,560
Never.

518
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,440
But ever since

519
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,040
I've seen you grow from a little boy

520
00:37:23,200 --> 00:37:24,760
to a big boy,

521
00:37:26,080 --> 00:37:27,440
I think

522
00:37:27,560 --> 00:37:28,600
it was worth it

523
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,760
to give up

524
00:37:30,760 --> 00:37:32,160
my pursuit of the Nobel Prize.

525
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:36,600
Although

526
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,920
it may delay human progress.

527
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:41,280
But what you said

528
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:42,640
really touched me

529
00:37:43,080 --> 00:37:43,840
Really?

530
00:37:47,120 --> 00:37:48,480
You're moving out, aren't you?

531
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:49,760
Just do it.

532
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,760
It's not a big deal.

533
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,320
As long as your Grandpa and I are alive,

534
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:57,440
There will always be

535
00:37:57,440 --> 00:37:58,560
a couch in this house

536
00:37:58,560 --> 00:38:00,760
where you can sleep.

537
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,680
In fact, this is also

538
00:38:02,920 --> 00:38:03,800
the significance of

539
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,080
my giving up

540
00:38:06,080 --> 00:38:07,480
the pursuit of the Nobel Prize.

541
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:09,480
I think

542
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,200
a family is meant to

543
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:14,200
live together.

544
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:25,080
It must be tiring

545
00:38:26,360 --> 00:38:27,800
taking care of a kid like me.

546
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:29,080
Of course.

547
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:32,200
But it's much, much easier

548
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:34,400
than winning a Nobel Prize.

549
00:38:38,760 --> 00:38:41,040
Take good care of yourself after you move out.

550
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:43,640
Eat less takeaway food.

551
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,120
Aren't you afraid of

552
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:15,600
being photographed by paparazzi here?

553
00:39:23,200 --> 00:39:24,720
I would love to be photographed

554
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,080
with you.

555
00:39:34,160 --> 00:39:35,080
Get up.

556
00:39:59,600 --> 00:40:02,500
[The development of Peking Opera]

557
00:40:05,710 --> 00:40:07,640
[Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period Rehearsal Room]

558
00:40:16,500 --> 00:40:19,500
[The art helps accomplish our dreams. Our dreams create our future.]

559
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,800
Excuse me, is the rehearsal at 9:00 today?

560
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:31,120
Are you also

561
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:33,080
running for Wu Zixu?

562
00:40:34,120 --> 00:40:36,320
Are you new to the college and never been on stage before?

563
00:40:36,760 --> 00:40:37,840
No.

564
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,160
That's it.

565
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:41,280
Mr. Li is sure to play the role of Wu Zixu.

566
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:44,280
But there are character A and B in operas.

567
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:46,240
We, including you,

568
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:48,280
are here so that Mr. Nan can decide that

569
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,000
which one of us will be the character B.

570
00:40:55,760 --> 00:40:57,480
You're here so early, bro.

571
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:00,480
Bro. Bro. Bro.

572
00:41:00,480 --> 00:41:02,440
Come here. Brother has brought us breakfast.

574
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,320
Thank you, bro.

575
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:10,960
Take it.

576
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,640
Good morning, Mr. Nan.

577
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:19,480
Good morning, Mr. Nan. Mr. Nan.

578
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:24,480
The weather is fine today.

579
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:27,160
Eat it out on the lawn.

580
00:41:28,680 --> 00:41:30,200
I'll take it out to eat.

581
00:41:32,320 --> 00:41:33,400
Take mine with you.
