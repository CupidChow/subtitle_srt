00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:47,240
Drawing the first eyebrow,

5
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,680
I'll break the oath.

6
00:01:53,440 --> 00:01:54,320
It was me

7
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:56,520
who forced you to make an oath.

8
00:01:58,280 --> 00:01:59,720
It was me who forced you to break the oath.

9
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,280
I was not afraid of practicing and being beaten,

10
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,840
but my greatest fear was

11
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:10,600
to tighten my head.

12
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:16,079
Tightening the head is to erect eyebrows,

13
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:17,760
so actors are good-looking.

14
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:20,520
It's also a warn for them

15
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:23,120
to follow rules.

16
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:29,920

18
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,640
Some fates is doomed

19
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:39,040
in the beginning.

20
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:43,960

00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,120
fasten the robes.

22
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:48,280
Some missions can't be given up

23
00:02:48,920 --> 00:02:50,680
since you begin to accept them.

24
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:53,120
Wear the bracelet,

25
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:54,240
and don't lose it.

26
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,240
I won't lose the bracelet

27
00:02:56,240 --> 00:02:57,960
from mummy.

28
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:03,520
Your mother abandons you.

00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,480
Yes.

You're talking rot.

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,320
Look,

32
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,520
your mother is talking with our master.

33
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,640
My mummy won't abandon me.

34
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,840
-Uncle. 
 -Uncle. 
 -Uncle.

35
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,079
Why not practice?

36
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:18,240
Come on, let's go practice.

37
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:30,600
A crooked man

38
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:32,480
shouldn't learn to act in an opera.

00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,400
I'm Yu Fei.

43
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,320
Play the third drum.

45
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:05,840

46
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,080
some new future.

Yes, I can.

It tells a hero's story.

50
00:04:17,160 --> 00:04:18,279

51
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,880
what role to act for us to be a hero?

52
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:22,960
Lao Sheng.

53
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,160
But you're a girl?

54
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,440
What's wrong with being a girl?

55
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:28,960
Who said girls can't be heroes

56
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,360
and act Lao Sheng?

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,760
You are right.

58

[Succession]

59
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:34,120
We don't care about the gender in Peking Opera.

60
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:37,159
Why do you want to be a hero?

61
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,120
Because Master said

62
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,200
there's no future for a girl to act Lao Sheng.

63
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:42,159
Therefore

64
00:04:42,159 --> 00:04:44,560
I have to stand in the middle of the stage

65
00:04:44,920 --> 00:04:47,560
under the spotlight,

66
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:48,840

00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:54,080

What's wrong with her costume?

What happened?

00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,440
What Yu Fei is wearing

76
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,280
is not the costume of Wu Zixu.

77
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:35,760
She is wearing wrong costume.

78
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:37,280
It's a great taboo for performers.

before you posted these on it?

Now, A Bei needs encouragement with love,

99

so you can't scold it.

100
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,600
I think you need education of love.

A Bei is my family's lucky car.

we have many audience today,

126
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:51,360
so why  not

127
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,680
throw away some props and costumes,

128
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:55,280
and then we take the subway?

129

Don't throw my props.

130

I found it when we lost the investment,

when our studio was investigated,

138

modify the demo for 23 times,

140
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:15,760
when Zhuang Sheng made mistakes

141
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:17,920
in making props for 37 times,

142
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:20,840
and when Gui Deng left.

Have you even a play without a hero?

00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:25,400
It indeed is.

The whole world opposes us.

146
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,040
The new hero is hard to deal with.

I've written 17 drafts of the flyleaf

and almost couldn't get myself out of bed.

151
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:39,680
You couldn't get yourself out of bed?

I think it's because you're lazy.

I think

296

it's because

297
00:15:05,960 --> 00:15:08,200
Wu Zixu's world

298
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:10,920

Wu Zixu and Chanyu Temple

Although no matter which way he chose,

305
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,440

and pick up stubs in front of the theater,

346
00:17:15,079 --> 00:17:16,200
I'll take a bottle of salt soda

00:17:16,200 --> 00:17:17,720
and talk about the old days with you.

348
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,359
The contest is over,

349
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,359
so there's no need to be generous.

350
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:22,800
I really mean it.

351
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:25,119
But I have something more important,

352
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:26,280
so I have to go.

353
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,560
If you win tonight,

354
00:17:32,560 --> 00:17:34,480
you'll have my congrats.

356
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,280
you're really awesome.

357
00:17:37,280 --> 00:17:38,440
I don't think it's a shame

358
00:17:38,440 --> 00:17:39,560
to lose to you.

359
00:17:39,920 --> 00:17:41,320
Neither do I.

360
00:17:41,320 --> 00:17:43,200
Yu Fei, see you.

361
00:17:52,800 --> 00:17:54,120

362
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,200
In such a hurry,

363
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,160
are you going to another performance?

364
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,680
Do your best no matter where you perform.

365
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:16,600
Keep it in mind.

366
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,400
As long as you're on the stage,

367
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,240
you're representing Shandengting troupe.

368
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:22,960
Understand?

369
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,360
Uncle,

370
00:18:31,160 --> 00:18:32,600
do you want to

371
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:34,520
see the performance?

372
00:18:39,800 --> 00:18:41,760

00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,800
It doesn't work again.

376
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:23,840
What happened? What to hit?

377
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:24,840
Get off and have a check.

00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,120
A Bei, well...

379
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,480
Can it work in this situation?

380
00:19:33,920 --> 00:19:35,320
It can't work,

381
00:19:35,640 --> 00:19:36,960
so run.

382
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,040
Go get our props.

00:19:38,040 --> 00:19:38,920

Look at these officers. It's scaring.

418
00:23:32,280 --> 00:23:33,960
Stop seeing. Mind your own business.

419
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,080
Stay away from troubles.

420

Liu Hairuo, from Linchuan,

421
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,720
is self-conceited and didn't obey His Majesty's order,

422
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:41,440
so he is sentenced to prison.

Dear Lord, please wait.

424
00:23:45,440 --> 00:23:47,480
Liu Hairuo is bewitched by a woman,

425
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:48,440
so he is delirious

426
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:50,480

427
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:52,400

00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:42,760

431
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:43,800
this

432
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,320

436

Liu Xichan, get out.

437
00:24:55,800 --> 00:24:57,760
You've ruined bro Liu's life,

438
00:24:57,760 --> 00:25:00,480
so I will kill you.

439

Don't be happy for survival,

440
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:06,720
and don't be sad for death.

441
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:08,080
What's this?

442
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,440
Is it holographic projection?

443
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:11,480
It's vivid. Awesome.

444
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:15,320
You can't kill me.

445
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,360
Why?

446
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,200
Do not realize I'm a guest in the dream.

447

if you love him,

453
00:25:33,680 --> 00:25:36,200
how can you stand to see him staying in the dream?

454
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:43,000
Bodhi has no trees, 
 while a bright mirror can't reflect.

455
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:45,680
There is nothing in the universe,

456
00:25:45,680 --> 00:25:47,960
where does dust come from?

457
00:25:48,960 --> 00:25:49,960
How do you know

458
00:25:49,960 --> 00:25:51,880
it's me who keeps him stay?

459
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:53,040
Talk nonsense.

460
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:54,000
I'll kill you.

461
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,160
It's useless

462
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:02,200
to push a boat on land.

463
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:16,960
It is better for the doer to undo what he has done.

464
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,160
If you want to know our story,

465

00:26:23,320 --> 00:26:25,640
I never want to frame bro Liu.

468
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:28,880

It seems real.

491
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,800
I don't know why she is in my dream.

492
00:28:04,800 --> 00:28:06,240

it was different.

liked the loneliness in her eyes.

503
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:31,720
I couldn't help thinking about her.

504
