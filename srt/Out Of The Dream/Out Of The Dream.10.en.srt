Yukito.

00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:42,080
♫ Never forgot. ♫

00:01:42,080 --> 00:01:44,080
♫ Will not forget. ♫

♫ Fall into the abyss, the dream can't come true. ♫

♫ Your voice ♫

9
00:01:50,690 --> 00:01:54,630
♫ keeps echoing in my heart. ♫

10
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,810
♫ The looks when we depart ♫

11
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,340
♫ tell the same fates. ♫

12
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,520
Why is it not what I expected?

13
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:24,560
Are you all right?

14
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:27,320
Don't wear strange clothes like these,

15
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,120
or you will fall over again.

16
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:33,360
What happened?

17
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,000
Nothing serious. The little girl fell.

18
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:35,800
Mengru, are you ok?

19
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,320
Girls like her who live in the 2-D world,

20
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,840
are not outstanding in real life,

21
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,840
so they're looking for their presence in another world.

22
00:02:40,840 --> 00:02:42,720
Never mind. They said that

23
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,920
because they don't understand it at all.

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,200
What's wrong with the 2-D world?

25
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:48,560
Shut your mouth since you know nothing.

26
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:50,079
As you said,

27
00:02:50,079 --> 00:02:51,840
guys like you who play games every day

28
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,440
are looking for you presence in games

29
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:54,440
because you are not recognized

30
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:56,280
in real life, right?

31
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,920
Who are you? What are you talking about?

32
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,680
So you're upset now?

33
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:01,160
Don't talk a lot of nonsense

34
00:03:01,160 --> 00:03:02,960
when you know nothing.

35
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,440
To show your respect and understanding to others,

36
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:07,200
is to respect yourself.

37
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:08,800
Let's go.

38
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:27,160
It's his loss

39
00:03:27,160 --> 00:03:28,480
for not knowing you.

40
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,800
Possibly he isn't your Yukito.

41
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,680
Why are you looking for your Yukito in others' stories?

42
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:36,440
You will have your own story.

43
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:37,880
In the story,

44
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:40,520
there will be a boy who loves Mengru only.

45
00:03:44,600 --> 00:03:45,640
Yu Fei,

46
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,560
is it the first time for you to dress like this?

47
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:49,800
Yes, it's amazing.

48
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:56,640
Why did you change your clothes?

49
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:58,240
Is it normal

50
00:03:58,240 --> 00:03:59,480
to wear like this?

51
00:03:59,480 --> 00:04:01,280
Who told you?

52
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:04,040
It's boring to wear your present clothes.

53
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,840
Go go go, change it back.

54
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,120
That's right. How can you bear it

55
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:08,400
to dress like this?

56
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:08,880
Right.

57
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,120
You look better in the former dress.

58
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,400
Come on, change it back.

59
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,080
Go and change.

60
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:29,080
Wow, you're pretty.

61
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:30,880
Cool. You look better.

62
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:32,480
Thank you.

63
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,080
In the Comic Con,

64
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,000
there are still a lot I haven't seen.

65
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,159
What you know but I don't.

66
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:40,920
So show me around.

67
00:04:40,920 --> 00:04:41,920
Let's go.

68
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:45,360
You haven't got your stuff yet. Hello?

69
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,800
Thank you.

70
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,040
Bro,

71
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,360
a person only has two hands.

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,240
She can't use them all 
 though you bought a lot.

73
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,040
The girl I like is special.

74
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:21,240
When we took exams in the primary school,

75
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:23,120
everyone went to borrow pens from her.

76
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,520
One for you, one for him, and one for another...

77
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:25,560
When the exam began,

78
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,080
she had no pen to use.

79
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:29,360
Well, it sounds a little silly.

80
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:30,600
Yes.

81
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,360
Besides, she is forgetful.

82
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:36,560
She'll take an exam tomorrow,

83
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:37,880
so I have to prepare more for her.

84
00:05:37,880 --> 00:05:39,320
Even though she lost 90% of tools,

85
00:05:39,320 --> 00:05:40,760
she still has 5 pieces left.

86
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,280
Well, as for the lost 90%,

87
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:44,640
I thinks she is on purpose.

88
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,280
So many tools,

89
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,159
I bet she can't handle them.

90
00:05:49,760 --> 00:05:51,360
That's why I'm with her.

91
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:55,920
I've prepared well.

92
00:05:56,360 --> 00:05:58,280
But bro, the girl you like

93
00:05:58,280 --> 00:05:58,920
is dating with Bai...

94
00:05:58,920 --> 00:06:00,880
No, no, no.

95
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,120
Opportunities are for prepared people.

96
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:05,680
If they break up,

97
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,280
I can be her boyfriend anytime.

98
00:06:07,760 --> 00:06:08,960
I've already decided that

99
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,960
as long as I insist on liking her,

100
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:11,960
even though she never turns back

101
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:13,680
and walks around the earth,

102
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,240
she will finally find my passion.

103
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,160
If insistence will end with happiness,

104
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:23,600
bro, I will insist too.

105
00:06:28,070 --> 00:06:34,000
[Jiubai]

106
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:32,000
I've sent you the mixed-edited demo.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,520
Nanshan Theater has been booked.

108
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,080
Let's go through a full dress rehearsal

109
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,760
to make sure everything goes well.

110
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:38,880
Who will check?

111
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:40,920
Your fellow schoolmate and Mr. Chen.

112
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,320
All staff in his department will come.

113
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:45,040
Are you sure you don't tell them that

114
00:06:45,040 --> 00:06:46,320
only when we pass the full rehearsal

115
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,680
can we get the front money?

116
00:06:50,320 --> 00:06:52,560
I'd like to sign the contract 
 and get your front money

117
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:54,000
when the first check is accepted.

118
00:06:55,040 --> 00:06:57,000
Well, you can't get any guarantee

119
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:58,720
for your initial investment.

120
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,880
If we want to sweep the board,

121
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,320
we have to take a risk.

122
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,160
It only makes everyone nervous if they know,

123
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,040
which will hamper their performance.

124
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:11,960
You should be confident in your people.

125
00:07:12,640 --> 00:07:15,000
Never mind. As long as they trust me.

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:18,400
Come out, everybody.

127
00:07:21,760 --> 00:07:23,800
Tell him, do you trust him?

128
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:28,960
Boss,

129
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:31,600
we have confidence in you, of course.

I've prepared a demo video.

137
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,080
As for the dance,

138
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,680
Mafang will help me review.

139
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:46,000
Costumes are ready.

140
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:47,560
They can be ironed and packed soon.

141
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:49,120
I'm sure you can't find any fold.

We're much more awesome than you think.

00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:14,440
In terms of dance and costumes,

172
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,120
we've emphasized these classic elements.

173
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:16,500
♫ Your voice ♫

174
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:21,250
♫ shows me direction in the fog. ♫

175
00:09:21,270 --> 00:09:23,720
♫ If standing in the sun, ♫

176
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,360
Speaking of implantation,

177
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:24,480
we've reinforced the presence of the 2-D world.

178
00:09:23,730 --> 00:09:26,500
♫ I am tolerated by the world. ♫

179
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,640
So the whole implantation will be much funnier.

180
00:09:27,340 --> 00:09:29,370
♫ Even though happiness is hard to reach. ♫

181
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:31,370
♫ Set off again. ♫

182
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:33,640
Sounds good.

183
00:09:33,640 --> 00:09:35,920
The implantation is out of my expectation.

184
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:38,160
It's funny

185
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,160
and refreshing.

186
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:44,160
Come to my office tomorrow afternoon

187
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:45,760
to sign the formal contract.

188
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:47,680
I'll ask the financial department to

189
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,560
transfer you the down payment soon.

190
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:52,360
Moreover, there are some details

191
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:53,360
to be modified.

192
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:55,640
When we're prepared,

193
00:09:56,040 --> 00:09:57,200
we'll discuss with you.

194
00:09:57,360 --> 00:09:58,120
No problem.

195
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,600
Thank you, Mr Chen, thank you very much.

196
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:00,240
One more thing,

197
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:02,160
please send us the theme song tomorrow,

198
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:03,440
so we can publicize in advance.

199
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:04,360
I'll send it to you before tomorrow morning.

200
00:10:04,360 --> 00:10:06,040
They're talking about your theme song.

201
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,120
Piece of cake.

202
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:07,880
Besides,

203
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:10,040
we can add two items in the contract.

204
00:10:10,040 --> 00:10:11,520
One is to extend

205
00:10:11,520 --> 00:10:12,960
the duration of the contract.

206
00:10:12,960 --> 00:10:14,600
The other item is to diversify

207
00:10:14,600 --> 00:10:16,240
its forms.

208
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:22,040
Don't open eyes.

209
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:25,640
Dear Mr Bai, I'm going to take an exam tomorrow.

210
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,880
I don't want to play games here.

211
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:29,400
Sit down.

212
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:33,920
What are you going to show me?

213
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:36,520
Wait for a minute.

214
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:41,560
Open your eyes.

215
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:44,800
Pass.

216
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:47,440
Congrats.

217
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,480
Sprint review before the exam from Mr Bai.

218
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:52,920
The first word you saw

219
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:55,480
is your fortune tomorrow.

220
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:58,160
Serious?

221
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:01,040
Have you prepared the only word "pass" here?

222
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,480
I'm not a boring man.

223
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:05,640
See, it's "love" there.

224
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:07,760
What a pity!

225
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:10,160
You won't think of me tomorrow.

226
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:11,960
"Money" on the other side.

227
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:15,480
It seems you can't get rich tomorrow either.

228
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,800
Anyway, it won't make a mistake.

229
00:11:18,920 --> 00:11:19,920
You'll pass the exam

230
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:22,480
as long as you see the word "pass".

231
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:26,400
You stage actors really have so many tricks.

232
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:30,520
Thank you.

233
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:32,920
Trust yourself.

234
00:11:34,280 --> 00:11:36,720
Then I will find other words.

235
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:38,880
Have you found one?

236
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:39,800
No need to find others.

237
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,360
I just take a glance.

238
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:47,200
Fine, no jokes any more.

239
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:49,800
Now I will give you the truly

240
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:50,960
magic weapon in exams.

241
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:56,840
A game coin?

242
00:11:58,840 --> 00:12:00,000
It was.

243
00:12:00,440 --> 00:12:01,880
But don't look down on it.

244
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,320
Because of it,

245
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,320
I have been the winner in the whole arcade.

246
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:09,560
Then I changed it into this

247
00:12:09,560 --> 00:12:10,840
chance coin.

248
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:13,440
Look,

249
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:19,280
if both are front sides,

250
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,280
choose A.

251
00:12:21,160 --> 00:12:23,280
If one is front side, the other is reverse side, 
 choose B.

252
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:26,800
If both are reverse sides, choose C.

253
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:30,480
Is it efficacious?

254
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,080
I'll have a try.

255
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:36,200
If Bai Feili loves me,

256
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,480
front sides.

257
00:12:37,480 --> 00:12:39,200
If he doesn't, reverse sides.

258
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,200
Let me check.

259
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:45,800
You don't need to use the coin to get the answer.

260
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,000
I can tell you right now.

261
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,480
Fine, Mr Bai,

262
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:57,560
I'm going to take an exam tomorrow,

263
00:12:57,760 --> 00:12:59,480
so please allow me to sleep.

264
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:01,720
Ok.

265
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:03,920
Then,

266
00:13:04,840 --> 00:13:06,440
let's go to sleep.

267
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,400
Yu Fei,

268
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:51,120
are you home tonight?

269
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:52,360
I have bought

270
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,800
the stuff you need for tomorrow's exam.

271
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:54,880
They are in...

272
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:05,720
Other girls' rooms are decorated with flower arrangements.

273
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:07,000
What's this?

274
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:09,000
A tree?

275
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:10,840
Flower arrangements will wither in few days,

276
00:14:10,840 --> 00:14:12,200
but potting is different.

277
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,400
It has roots,

278
00:14:13,400 --> 00:14:14,520
so it can keep alive for a long time.

279
00:15:04,520 --> 00:15:05,280
Do your best.

280
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:30,360
Don't get nervous and do it carefully.

281
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:32,000
Relax.

282
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:33,760
I will remember what you've taught

283
00:15:33,760 --> 00:15:34,800
and make you proud of me.

284
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:36,640
Trust yourself.

285
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:47,880
What's the matter?

286
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,560
I don't need to buy houses.

287
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:52,720
Stop calling me.

288
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,480
Do you know you've illegally accessed others' privacy?

289
00:15:58,920 --> 00:15:59,560
Nothing.

290
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,840
So, take the exam carefully.

291
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:05,920
I'm leaving.

292
00:16:11,400 --> 00:16:12,360
See you.

293
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:21,960
The theme song was divulged.

294
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,720
What do you mean?

295
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:26,720
Feiwo posted an original song at 7:30 a.m.,

296
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:28,440
and the melody is the same as ours.

297
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:29,640
Where is Wuchang?

298
00:16:29,840 --> 00:16:30,840
He is missing.

299
00:16:33,320 --> 00:16:34,120
In our material library,

300
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,680
there are 3 songs that haven't been used,

301
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,160
Plus the melodies with fragments,

302
00:16:38,200 --> 00:16:40,000
we still have time to create a new song.

303
00:16:40,000 --> 00:16:40,400
But I...

304
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:41,440
Don't say "but".

305
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:44,040
Ask Mengru to continue calling Wuchang.

306
00:16:44,520 --> 00:16:46,040
Ask Zhuang Sheng to go to Wuchang's house

307
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:47,200
and check whether he is awake or not.

308
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:50,240
Ask Gui Deng and Hao Shi to visit the places 
 where Wuchang visits a lot

309
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:51,440
and see if he goes there or not.

310
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:52,840
You go right now,

311
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,400
and we'll meet in the recording studio in half an hour.

312
00:18:22,280 --> 00:18:23,760
What's wrong with the man?

313
00:18:24,360 --> 00:18:25,840
Why is he sleeping here?

314
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:41,200
Oh my god! My purity!

315
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:44,600
Stop shooting!

316
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,720
What are you doing? Stop taking pictures of me!

317
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,720
Boss, I'm sorry.

318
00:18:55,680 --> 00:18:56,680
It's my fault.

319
00:18:57,920 --> 00:18:58,960
I've incriminated you all.

320
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,800
Who did you drink with?

321
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
I didn't drink with anyone.

322
00:19:03,640 --> 00:19:06,240
The wine in the gourd on stage yesterday

323
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:07,360
is real.

324
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:09,080
I didn't know until I drank it.

325
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:11,400
But clients sat offstage,

326
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:13,000
I didn't want to destroy the cooperation,

327
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,800
so I stuck to the performance.

328
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,640
When I went backstage, I couldn't hold on.

329
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:19,720
Later,

330
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,160
I had no idea what has happened.

331
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:25,240
You said the wine in the gourd

332
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,640
is real wine.

333
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,720
Yes, the gourd made by Zhuang Sheng.

334
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,120
We prepared well,

335
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:45,480
but why did Wuchang drop the ball at the last minute?

336
00:19:50,360 --> 00:19:51,200
You bastard Zhuang Sheng,

337
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,480
I know you did it.

338
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:53,400
Wuchang, calm down.

339
00:19:53,400 --> 00:19:54,040
What do you mean?

340
00:19:54,040 --> 00:19:55,120
Wuchang.

341
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:57,240
Why did you put real wine in the gourd?

342
00:19:57,240 --> 00:19:58,480
Are you kidding?

343
00:19:58,680 --> 00:19:59,240
For so many rehearsals,

344
00:19:59,240 --> 00:20:00,920
I've never used real wine.

345
00:20:01,080 --> 00:20:02,320
Yesterday in the gourd,

346
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:03,760
somebody put real wine and I had to drink it.

347
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:06,200
This morning I woke up in the foot bridge.

348
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:08,800
No one knows I get drunk easily but you.

349
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:10,240
If you're not the mole,

350
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:11,000
then who?

351
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:11,840
So you can't stop, right?

352
00:20:11,840 --> 00:20:12,680
It's you.

353
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:13,720
Will you stop?

354
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,880
Stop!

355
00:20:18,280 --> 00:20:18,920
If there is something,

356
00:20:18,920 --> 00:20:21,040
let's sit and talk.

357
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,480
Where is Guanjiu?

358
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,640
Who knows where Guanjiu is?

359
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,320
I don't know.

360
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:33,560
Mengru?

361
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:40,880
X Club. She has a meeting with Zhou Jiajun.

362
00:20:41,080 --> 00:20:42,640
She said she wanted to have a try.

363
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:45,320
No way.

364
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:51,520
Gui Deng, watch them.

365
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:03,480
Nothing serious.

366
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:05,040
You can return to be a programmer anyway.

367
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:10,200
I've already quit.

368
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,360
Now

369
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:14,320
I just want to engage in stage show.

370
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:17,800
I didn't expect this.

371
00:21:19,320 --> 00:21:20,800
It's your problem,

372
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:22,840
so the best I can do

373
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:25,080
is to persuade our company not to sue you.

374
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,120
You got many

375
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:29,040
offers when you graduated,

376
00:21:29,040 --> 00:21:30,200
but you didn't accept any of them.

377
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,320
You said you were at 20s,

378
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:34,040
so you would fight for your dream.

379
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:36,160
Now you are 29,

380
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,520
so what, are you afraid of failure?

381
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,000
I'm not afraid,

382
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:50,000
but I don't want those who chose me

383
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,120
to lose.

384
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:06,720
This is what

385
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:09,200
you wanted 10 years ago,

386
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,720
but I didn't give you.

387
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,480
Today I'd like to give it to you

388
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,320
to show my good faith.

389
00:22:15,320 --> 00:22:17,000
Can you help Jiubai win?

390
00:22:33,160 --> 00:22:34,320
Zhou Jiajun,

391
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,480
would you please help us?

392
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:39,280
Don't hold me.

393
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,120
Zhou Jiajun, let go off me.

394
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:44,400
Are you all right?

395
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,160
What did you do to her?

396
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:47,840
Who are you?

397
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:48,640
Are you a man?

398
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,880
What's wrong with you?

399
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:52,520
Hao Shi,

400
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,280
send Guanjiu home.

401
00:22:54,280 --> 00:22:55,600
I'll handle this.

402
00:23:02,160 --> 00:23:03,520
Are you ok,

403
00:23:12,920 --> 00:23:13,920
Master Guanjiu?

404
00:23:14,800 --> 00:23:16,400
Master Guanjiu, you vomit...

405
00:23:19,920 --> 00:23:21,400
The wine is expensive.

406
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:23,560
Be careful.

407
00:23:28,600 --> 00:23:29,480
Screw you.

408
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:31,000
Don't take off.

409
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,240
Master Guanjiu.

410
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:33,720
Screw you.

411
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,440
What nonsense? Afraid of failure?

412
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:44,200
I've given you my most valuable thing.

413
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,560
What most valuable thing?

414
00:23:47,240 --> 00:23:48,720
Why did you give it to him?

415
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:52,720
You want it too?

416
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:55,480
You should have told me earlier.

417
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,560
Where's my phone?

418
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,520
Where is my phone?

419
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:09,400
Here. I'll get it for you.

420
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,480
My phone.

421
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,280
Hello?

422
00:24:15,760 --> 00:24:17,400
Answer the phone.

423
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:19,640
Hurry up! Answer the phone.

424
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:23,560
Answer it.

425
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,200
Hello.

426
00:24:27,480 --> 00:24:28,360
Dad,

427
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:32,840
are you still awake?

428
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:35,320
I,

429
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:36,280
I am awake.

430
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:38,760
I saw Zhou Jiajun today.

431
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:43,560
How is he doing?

432
00:24:44,680 --> 00:24:47,120
He is fine.

433
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,400
He is doing good.

434
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,880
He leads a life

435
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:54,360
that you want me to have.

436
00:24:54,960 --> 00:24:56,920
He seems to be a manager anytime

437
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,200
and reach a great height in life.

438
00:25:00,800 --> 00:25:02,440
Are you going to be with him?

439
00:25:03,040 --> 00:25:04,680
It's you who like him,

440
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,480
not me.

441
00:25:08,360 --> 00:25:09,360
That's cool.

442
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,920
The year of graduation,

443
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,080
I said I wanted to engage in stage shows.

444
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:21,640
You said

445
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:25,440
if I chose it,

446
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,040
I should never call you and tell you I regretted.

447
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,520
Ten years.

448
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:35,680
It's been ten years.

449
00:25:37,560 --> 00:25:40,600
It seems I have got nothing.

450
00:25:46,920 --> 00:25:48,680
For these years,

451
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:51,840
I've participated in many classmate reunions.

452
00:25:52,120 --> 00:25:55,800
They all have got different achievements.

453
00:25:56,680 --> 00:25:59,160
Congrats on your new application start-up.

454
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:01,400
Congrats on the completion of New York Edison

455
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,560
whose interior design is from you.

456
00:26:05,320 --> 00:26:06,920
If possible, they would like to say

457
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,600
my kid is going to spend this summer

458
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:10,520
in Starship Titanic Camp.

459
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:11,200
Or when do I have the honor to

460
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:13,680
refuel in the space station you just bought.

461
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:15,920
It's not true.

462
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,920
You have your progresses that are worth congratulations.

463
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:24,600
Yes, I do.

464
00:26:30,400 --> 00:26:33,800
I've got the same congrats every year.

465
00:26:35,320 --> 00:26:36,960
Guan Zhijiu,

466
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:39,600
you're so amazing

467
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,240
that you're sticking to your original dream.

468
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:50,760
But,

469
00:26:51,160 --> 00:26:52,800
but their eyes were full of

470
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:55,520
sympathy.

471
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,400
Only me.

472
00:27:01,040 --> 00:27:02,360
Only me,

473
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:05,640
are still cherishing the dream,

474
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,240
so I won't miss anything

475
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:10,880
before I lose.

476
00:27:11,480 --> 00:27:13,280
If you want to give it up, do it.

477
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:15,400
What's the matter at your 30s?

478
00:27:18,040 --> 00:27:19,040
Being 30 without any achievement

479
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:22,680
means what I've done these years are nothing,

480
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:24,480
which is ridiculous.

481
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,720
Don't say this.

482
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,680
You told me

483
00:27:28,840 --> 00:27:30,320
the regret at 18

484
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:31,800
is different from that at 30.

485
00:27:32,240 --> 00:27:34,240
If I were 30

486
00:27:34,800 --> 00:27:36,760
and I didn't like the former choice,

487
00:27:36,760 --> 00:27:37,840
I wouldn't blame myself.

488
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,120
Because thanks to that choice,

489
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,800
I could see a broader world

490
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:43,960
and I would be proud of

491
00:27:45,040 --> 00:27:47,040
each choice I made.

492
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,960
I didn't waste my passion

493
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:51,360
and I did everything I could.

494
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:54,160
Master Guanjiu is a person like this,

495
00:27:54,360 --> 00:27:56,280
so you're a charming person.

496
00:27:58,840 --> 00:28:00,440
You're not 30,

497
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:02,120
how do you know?

498
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:03,840
You don't know.

499
00:28:11,630 --> 00:28:16,870
♫ In glimmer, touch your face as the candle flickers. ♫

500
00:28:15,240 --> 00:28:16,840
Come on, stand up.

501
00:28:17,950 --> 00:28:22,760
♫ Slightly drunk, invite the yearning to fall asleep with me. ♫

502
00:28:24,920 --> 00:28:30,280
♫ In the silent night, loneliness scatters. ♫

503
00:28:25,080 --> 00:28:26,960
It's hurt.

504
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,640
Pop on my back.

505
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:36,880
♫ The awake lights are still on. ♫

506
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,520
It's hurt.

507
00:28:37,000 --> 00:28:38,600
Follow me

508
00:28:38,600 --> 00:28:40,320
and see what it looks like at my 30s.

509
00:28:38,710 --> 00:28:43,880
♫ Good and bad in the past interlock, 
 the moonlight is touching you and  me. ♫

510
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:42,360
Then you'll know.

511
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:46,640
Thanks for your consolation, Mr driver.

513

Now send me home as the navigation.

Fasten your seatbelt.

515

♫ How time flies. Don't let go of me. ♫

Go! Go!

524
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:20,160
First of all,

525
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:22,920
you're satisfied with our rehearsal.

526
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:25,440
If you choose another studio,

527
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,880
it's hard to say whether the play can be performed as scheduled.

528
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,200
Secondly,

529
00:29:29,680 --> 00:29:31,440
I'm not sure whether other studios would like to

530
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:33,000
propose the same conditions

531
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,080
and take risks with you, just like us.

532
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,880
Thirdly,

533
00:29:37,440 --> 00:29:38,960
as for the negative news of Sir Wuchang,

534
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:40,400
I can fix it and

535
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,160
I just need a little more time.

536
00:29:45,280 --> 00:29:46,080
First of all,

537
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:47,560
we're satisfied with both

538
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,200
Feiwo and you.

539
00:29:49,440 --> 00:29:51,440
They've made a complete plan too.

540
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:52,760
Secondly,

541
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:54,680
Li Hentian came to the company today,

542
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,760
and he proposed the same conditions as you.

543
00:29:57,320 --> 00:29:58,080
Thirdly,

544
00:29:58,320 --> 00:30:00,120
the best way to fix negative news is

545
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,000
to fire Sir Wuchang

546
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:03,040
and stay unaffected.

547
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:06,520
Impossible.

548
00:30:07,280 --> 00:30:09,800
Sir Wuchang is one member of Jiubai.

549
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:12,280
There is something I might not say,

550
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:13,960
nor am I supposed to say.

551
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:19,000
The purpose she came to me

552
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:19,680
is not to beg me to support you

553
00:30:19,680 --> 00:30:21,360
in continuing performing Dragon Scale,

554
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:22,400
but to ask me to pay your

555
00:30:22,400 --> 00:30:23,680
early advances.

556
00:30:27,240 --> 00:30:28,920
Give it to her.

557
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,160
I wanted it ten years ago,

558
00:30:31,680 --> 00:30:33,040
but I've changed my mind ten years later,

559
00:30:33,240 --> 00:30:34,960
so I don't like it.

[Sober-up Soup Materials]

561
00:31:36,200 --> 00:31:37,800
A shelf life of two years.

562
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:40,200
It's expired for four years.

563
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:55,280
Master Guanjiu isn't good at taking care of herself.

564

566
00:32:09,880 --> 00:32:11,320
What a nuisance!

567
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,760
I'll fight back hard.

568
00:32:15,640 --> 00:32:16,480
Never mind.

569
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:19,320
As the old saying goes,

570
00:32:19,640 --> 00:32:21,560
if you are patient in one moment of anger,

571
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:24,000
you will escape a hundred days of sorrow.

572
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:26,880
When I'm done with my exams,

573
00:32:26,880 --> 00:32:29,080
you'll find yourselves in serious trouble.

00:32:48,120 --> 00:32:50,720
Ashley Scot, are you still awake?

575
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:52,360
Why are you so late?

576
00:32:58,880 --> 00:33:00,240
You...

577
00:33:00,240 --> 00:33:01,760
Is everything going on well with your exam?

578
00:33:04,760 --> 00:33:07,720
Use one question to answer another.

579
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:09,360
Mr Bai,

580
00:33:09,680 --> 00:33:11,240
there is something wrong with you.

581
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:16,680
Fine, I won't escape.

582
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:18,840
Don't pretend

583
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:20,960
you didn't search the news of Sir Wuchang.

584
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:27,440
I like the way you behave directly.

585
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:29,600
Here is the thing.

586
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,520
I know you

587
00:33:32,520 --> 00:33:34,000
are upset today.

588
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:37,440
So I've prepared a unique technique

589
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:39,360
to make you happy.

590
00:33:39,360 --> 00:33:41,960
Well, it's also a warm-up

591
00:33:41,960 --> 00:33:43,320
for my professional exam tomorrow.

592
00:33:45,880 --> 00:33:47,120
You

593
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:49,720
have a unique technique?

594
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:53,360
Of course, actually I have many unique techniques.

595
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:55,520
Close your eyes.

596
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,000
Come on, close your eyes.

597
00:34:02,240 --> 00:34:04,720
I don't think it's appropriated 
 to see it in the living room.

598
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,080
How about

599
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:08,400
moving to the bedroom?

600
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,639
Here I go.

601
00:34:25,080 --> 00:34:27,480
What do you think? Am I awesome?

602
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:33,159
What's wrong?

603
00:34:35,120 --> 00:34:37,600
You've no idea how ridiculous

604
00:34:37,880 --> 00:34:39,280
for a person who is normally serious

605
00:34:39,719 --> 00:34:40,960
to do things like this.

606
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:43,440
It's not funny, okay?

607
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,360
Tell you the truth.

608
00:34:44,360 --> 00:34:46,400
It's difficult to walk like a dwarf.

609
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:48,600
Is it the unique technique 
 for a harlequin to walk like a dwarf?

610
00:34:49,080 --> 00:34:50,600
How can you do it since 
 you play the role of a senior male?

611
00:34:50,960 --> 00:34:52,800
When I was in the Shandengting troupe,

612
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:56,280
I learned it from my brothers and sisters in secret.

613
00:34:56,280 --> 00:34:58,080
Beside walking like a dwarf,

614
00:34:58,080 --> 00:35:00,600
I'm also good at shaking sleeves,

615
00:35:00,600 --> 00:35:01,720
doing a somersault and spinning.

616
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:04,520
When you were busy with learning English words at school,

617
00:35:04,520 --> 00:35:05,920
I was busy too.

618
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,880
But you still didn't escape

619
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,160
from reciting English words.

620
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:13,760
So

621
00:35:14,440 --> 00:35:16,520
you've made a decision since your childhood

622
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:18,120
to act in operas for your whole life?

623
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:24,080
In fact, walking like a dwarf I just did

624
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,640
is from one of my brothers.

625
00:35:27,040 --> 00:35:29,960
He's bent on acting a senior male,

626
00:35:30,560 --> 00:35:32,560
but he was chosen to act a harlequin.

627
00:35:32,800 --> 00:35:34,880
So he practiced hard for the role of a harlequin.

628
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:38,280
But at his 3rd grade in middle high school, 
 he was 1.9 meters high.

629
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:41,200
His voice began to change,

630
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:44,640
so there was no chance for him to act in operas.

631
00:35:45,400 --> 00:35:46,600
That makes me feel

632
00:35:47,080 --> 00:35:48,600
the reason I can continue acting in operas,

633
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,480
is because the opera has chosen me.

634
00:35:51,240 --> 00:35:52,160
Just like you,

635
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:55,040
Chinoiserie stage play chose you.

636
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:56,680
We're both lucky.

637
00:36:00,080 --> 00:36:01,480
What if the person

638
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,640
who promised to stay with you

639
00:36:05,800 --> 00:36:07,480
and work with you

640
00:36:08,280 --> 00:36:09,760
choose to abandon you?

641
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:18,840
I don't think they choose to give up,

642
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,800
but when they arrive in a station,

643
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,120
they have to get off.

644
00:36:26,120 --> 00:36:29,880
Although we started together,

645
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:32,720
it doesn't mean

646
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:37,480
we have to stay together until the destination.

647
00:36:38,600 --> 00:36:39,800
Everyone

648
00:36:40,240 --> 00:36:42,880
has the right to choose their destination.

649
00:36:50,440 --> 00:36:51,680
What about you?

650
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,360
Which destination do you choose?

651
00:36:58,080 --> 00:36:59,960
Me?

652
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:03,240
I think I

653
00:37:04,600 --> 00:37:06,240
won't reach 1.9 meters tall,

654
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:10,520
so I have to act in operas.

655
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:14,720
Right.

656
00:37:15,120 --> 00:37:17,480
But if you go to bed so late every night,

657
00:37:18,240 --> 00:37:20,080
of course you can't reach 1.9 meters tall.

658
00:37:22,520 --> 00:37:23,680
So

659
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,440
let's go to bed.

660
00:38:05,520 --> 00:38:07,160
Edward,

661
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,000
happy 16th birthday.

662
00:38:13,480 --> 00:38:14,560
This is

663
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,800
my favorite comic book.

664
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,120
I'll put it in

665
00:38:19,120 --> 00:38:20,480
the former bookshelf.

666
00:38:21,240 --> 00:38:22,920
You can read it when you're free.

667
00:38:24,200 --> 00:38:26,520
If you want other gifts on your next birthday,

668
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:28,480
tell me in my dream.

669
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,200
The brother

670
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,880
has come to see you.

671
00:38:46,920 --> 00:38:48,800
It's been years.

672
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:51,040
He still treats you like a child

673
00:38:51,720 --> 00:38:53,320
and sends you these toys.

674
00:39:13,240 --> 00:39:14,480
Who's calling?

675
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:16,160
Do you have to answer it outside? 
 Answer it here.

676
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,320
Hello? Yes, we've booked a table for nine people.

677
00:39:21,800 --> 00:39:23,800
But there is

678
00:39:23,800 --> 00:39:25,720
an insane person here,

679
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,280
so we have to cancel it.

680
00:39:27,360 --> 00:39:29,960
Sorry to bother you.

681
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:31,200
Who are you talking about? Who is insane?

682
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:32,600
You know it.

683
00:39:32,600 --> 00:39:33,520
Why are staring at me?

684
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:34,480
So what if I'm staring at you?

685
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,480
Who are you going to report to?

686
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:36,920
What do you mean?

687
00:39:37,760 --> 00:39:39,240
Would you please stop quarreling?

688
00:39:39,400 --> 00:39:41,160
It's work time.

689
00:39:42,120 --> 00:39:43,840
Look at your glasses.

690
00:39:43,840 --> 00:39:44,760
Why are you wearing glasses?

691
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:46,080
You dare not to look at me directly, right?

692
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,280
I'm looking at you, so what?

693
00:39:56,080 --> 00:39:58,920
I just bought a surveillance camera.

694
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,760
Wait.

695
00:40:02,600 --> 00:40:03,920
From now on, everything brought in the office

696
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:06,000
must be checked by me.

697
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:06,920
In case some strange props

698
00:40:06,920 --> 00:40:07,800
will be brought in,

699
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:08,880
and I will be framed.

700
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,080
Would you please stop?

701
00:40:18,080 --> 00:40:19,800
It's not good to satirize each other.

702
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,520
Let's be frank and speak out what we think.

703
00:40:21,680 --> 00:40:24,200
Fine, be frank.

704
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:26,120
Chocolate,

705
00:40:26,120 --> 00:40:27,880
you're also a suspect.

706
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:29,440
Before you came to Jiubai,

707
00:40:29,600 --> 00:40:30,520
you knew everything about us.

708
00:40:30,520 --> 00:40:31,680
I don't think it was normal.

709
00:40:31,880 --> 00:40:33,320
Shut up.

710
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:35,480
Who knows whether you tell the truth or not?

711
00:40:35,480 --> 00:40:36,520
You're the No. 1 suspect.

712
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:38,000
How dare you judge me?

713
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:39,080
I'm the No. 1 suspect?

714
00:40:39,280 --> 00:40:40,640
Stop it.

715
00:40:48,680 --> 00:40:50,240
This is the payment

716
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:53,120
for people who want to leave.

717
00:41:00,600 --> 00:41:03,640
[Jiubai]

718
00:41:08,920 --> 00:41:10,560
Why are you standing here?

719
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:12,240
The CEO wants to be a security guard?

720
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:14,480
Let's go inside.

721
00:41:15,960 --> 00:41:17,200
Guanjiu,

722
00:41:18,720 --> 00:41:20,080
don't come in now.

723
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
Let's give some time for the person

724
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:23,400
and ask him to leave by himself.

725
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,560
What's wrong with you?

726
00:41:24,760 --> 00:41:26,600
To err is human.

727
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,400
Well, we failed this time ,that it.

728
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:34,280
We still have a long way to go.

729
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,720
Being friends for years,

730
00:41:37,000 --> 00:41:39,240
we can fix it by eating a hot pot.

731
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,680
What if it were you?

732
00:41:43,800 --> 00:41:45,440
If you made the mistake,

733
00:41:46,920 --> 00:41:49,400
even though we can forgive you 
 and forget about it,

734
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:53,160
can you forget about it?

735
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:58,480
Not everyone who start together

736
00:42:00,360 --> 00:42:02,560
can reach to the destination together.

737
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:06,800
Because we're friends for years,

738
00:42:08,120 --> 00:42:09,320
and because

739
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,200
Jiubai can bear fragility and imperfection,

740
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:16,280
we

741
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:18,720
can't force him to stay.

742
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,720
Leave him a chance to choose.

743
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:30,920
I've bought seasoning according to everyone's likes.

744
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:32,840
Check it.

745
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:36,000
Wuchang likes sesame paste.

746
00:42:36,480 --> 00:42:39,480
Mengru likes barque sauce.

747
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:42,240
Zhuang Sheng needs two cans of sesame oil.

748
00:42:42,920 --> 00:42:44,920
Ma Fang likes cayenne pepper circles.

749
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:48,920
Gui Deng will brush teeth several times

750
00:42:48,920 --> 00:42:50,920
after having mashed garlic.

751
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:52,520
Because he's afraid of being criticized by his wife.

752
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:55,080
Only you weirdo,

753
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,560
never has seasoning for hot pot.

754
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,960
I can't bear even anyone leaves.

755
00:43:11,920 --> 00:43:13,600
I know.

756
00:43:14,920 --> 00:43:16,680
So I do it.

757
00:43:18,720 --> 00:43:20,080
You go out for a walk.

758
00:43:21,600 --> 00:43:23,320
In one hour,

759
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:24,920
you can come back to have hot pot happily,

760
00:43:26,040 --> 00:43:28,200
pretending nothing happened.

761
00:43:28,200 --> 00:43:30,000
I know you're right.

762
00:43:32,960 --> 00:43:34,920
Leave me alone.

763
00:43:37,360 --> 00:43:39,400
I believe we'll be better.

764
00:43:50,600 --> 00:43:51,920
We're partners,

765
00:43:55,200 --> 00:43:57,400
so you don't have to do everything alone.
