you're a genius.

It's not proper to ask her to perform first.

Yes.

00:15:59,960 --> 00:16:00,680

and you've watched my performance.

256

when we're drinking.

257
00:16:45,720 --> 00:16:46,800
If you propose a toast,

258
00:16:46,960 --> 00:16:47,960
you have to drink a toast to everyone in the room.

259

-Yes. 
 -Right.

funded for Shandengting troupe,

263

 -Well done.

Then...

276
00:18:49,000 --> 00:18:50,000
Miss Yu, a question.

277
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:51,800
When you perform on the stage,

278
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:53,640
will the audience return tickets

279
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:54,800
if you stop

280
00:18:54,920 --> 00:18:55,840
in the middle of the play?

281
00:18:58,920 --> 00:18:59,920
Yes, you're right.

282
00:19:00,920 --> 00:19:02,320
So do you think it's appropriate

283
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:04,360
to sit down halfway

284
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:06,240
when the other of us are waiting for your toasts?

285
00:19:10,920 --> 00:19:12,440
If I keep drinking,

286
00:19:12,800 --> 00:19:14,920
I'm afraid I can't perform well then.

287
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:16,160
Never mind.

288
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:18,080
Today,

289
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:20,360
we have to get satisfied in drinking,

290
00:19:20,880 --> 00:19:22,040
then we're going to see your performance.

291
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,520
We

292
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:24,840
won't embarrass you.

293
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:26,920
The money for Shandengting troupe

294
00:19:27,120 --> 00:19:28,120
will be doubled.

295
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:32,280
-What do you think? 
 -You have to drink this time.

296

301
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:46,600
I'll drink for you.

302
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:09,480
I'm sorry.

303

I'm late.

304
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,360
It's fine, Bai.

305
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:14,960
It's not cool.

306
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:17,720
Miss Yu should drink it.

307
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,800
We are

308
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,880
friends for years.

309
00:20:22,840 --> 00:20:25,040
We funded Shandengting troupe together,

310
00:20:25,040 --> 00:20:26,520
so she has to drink a toast to everyone.

311
00:20:26,520 --> 00:20:27,160
Am I right?

312
00:20:27,160 --> 00:20:29,240
-Yes. 
 Right.

313
00:20:29,240 --> 00:20:31,480
Whoever asks her to drink more tonight,

314
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:34,720
he has a problem with me.

315
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,520
Bai,

316
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:40,360
everyone present here is my friend,

317
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,400
so relax.

318
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:42,840
Relax.

319
00:20:44,800 --> 00:20:46,000
Mr Bai,

320
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:47,840
we haven't seen you for a long time.

321
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,280
You're still graceful.

322
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:53,400
But look at yourself,

323
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,440
you're endangering yourself,

324
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,480
I'm wondering how you can protect others?

325
00:21:00,120 --> 00:21:01,120
By the way,

326
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:03,200
I need to remind  you.

327
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,000
Don't act like your father

328
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:06,960
to pursue the victory

329
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:08,800
regardless of steadiness

330
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:10,840
whatever he does.

331
00:21:21,560 --> 00:21:22,760
The reason I'm here

332
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,080
is to ask Mr Lou

333
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:28,360
how to run a steady business.

334
00:21:29,560 --> 00:21:32,080
Can we reach a win-win agreement?

335
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:34,400
Bai, in this regard,

336
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:35,720
you're inferior to your father.

337
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,080
It's a private dining,

338
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:39,840
so we don't talk about business.

339
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:41,600
Well,

340
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,760
the best Senior Male of Shandengting troupe

341
00:21:43,920 --> 00:21:46,360
as well as Mr Nan Huaiming's best student,

342
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:47,680
Miss Yu is here.

343
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:50,200
I hope to

344
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,680
contribute to our traditional art

345
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:53,040
and do something for Shandengting troupe.

346
00:21:53,960 --> 00:21:54,840
Check this.

347
00:21:54,840 --> 00:21:57,280
I've prepared the stage and band.

348
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:59,520
It's also a congrats on

349
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,680
Mr Li's promotion.

350
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:03,400
Congratulations.

351
00:22:03,800 --> 00:22:04,640
Mr Lou,

352
00:22:04,840 --> 00:22:07,200
we're here for dinner,

353
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:09,800
but you ask her to perform,

354
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,360
which seems we bully the young people.

355
00:22:13,240 --> 00:22:15,000
No, no, don't get me wrong.

356
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:17,000
Miss Yu wants to perform for us.

357
00:22:17,320 --> 00:22:18,240
Isn't it, Miss Yu?

358
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:20,320
Yes.

359
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:22,080
Acting Opera is better

360
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,640
than drinking.

361
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:26,560
I just need to know

362
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,120
which part do you like?

363
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:28,680
What do you think?

364
00:22:29,240 --> 00:22:31,400
Well, you know a lot.

365
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,120
Hold on.

366
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:34,720
Tonight,

367
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:35,920
there's another expert in the room

368
00:22:35,920 --> 00:22:37,560
besides Miss Yu.

369
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:38,960
We

370
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:39,880
have

371
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,080
a secret celebrity here.

372
00:22:44,200 --> 00:22:44,720
Who is it?

373
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,120
Well,

374
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:46,920
Bai,

375
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:48,520
your mother

376
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:49,680
was a celebrity

377
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:51,120
in Shanghai.

378
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,840
Her lyrics

379
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,440
'I beg you to drink wine

380
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:55,720
while listening to my song',

381
00:22:56,080 --> 00:22:56,800
I believe,

382
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:59,240
have been remembered by us.

383
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:01,880
You mother is Shang Dong?

384
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:07,440
It is said

385
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:10,440
Shang Dong, the Qing Yi actress of her generation,

386
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:12,120
passes on her knowledge to nobody

387
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,160
but her son.

388
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:16,480
But partially.

389
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:19,080
It's our honor

390
00:23:19,080 --> 00:23:21,480
to see Farewell My Concubine of the Shang school.

391
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:22,080
Yes.

392
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:24,600
Mr Lou, I owe you a favor.

393
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,080
Never mind. As long as  you are happy.

394
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:29,680
But,

395
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,280
Miss Yu acts Senior Male,

396
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:34,360
so can you act Hua Lian

397
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,880
just for one night?

398
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:39,000
Bai,

399
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:40,800
what do you say?

400
00:23:43,920 --> 00:23:44,880
Ok.

401
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:49,280
Since Mr Lou is willing to offer a chance,

402
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:51,400
tonight,

403
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:54,800
on the name of my mother,

404
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:56,440
I'll show myself up.

405
00:23:56,800 --> 00:23:59,280
Good. Perfect.

406
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,000
Mr Lou,

407
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,200
let me play Yuji.

408
00:24:23,160 --> 00:24:25,080
He is far from a professional amateur performer.

409
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:27,400
Everyone will be disappointed

410
00:24:27,400 --> 00:24:28,800
if he makes mistakes.

411
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,720
You're too young.

412
00:24:32,120 --> 00:24:33,480
Guys like Mr Chen,

413
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,480
they don't mean to watch his performance,

414
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,680
they're recalling the one of their generation.

415
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:39,200
Mr Lou,

416
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,200
it's actors

417
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:43,480
who decide their roles on the stage.

418
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:45,480
But stuff off-stage

419
00:24:45,680 --> 00:24:47,560
will be decided by the audience.

420
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:48,640
That's it.

421
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:50,720
If you want to see,

422
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:51,960
I'll play.

423
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,680
I hope you can give me a chance

424
00:24:55,040 --> 00:24:56,640
to talk about my father's business

425
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,480
after the performance.

426
00:25:01,000 --> 00:25:02,120
Just like your father,

427
00:25:02,680 --> 00:25:04,000
you're always

428
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:05,960
proud.

429
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:08,640
But today you came to beg me,

430
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,520
as a senior,

431
00:25:10,520 --> 00:25:11,760
I will help you.

432
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:14,880
You mother

433
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:16,400
was well-known then,

434
00:25:17,320 --> 00:25:18,880
don't destroy her reputation.

435
00:25:19,160 --> 00:25:20,240
Here,

436
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,240
change the costume.

437
00:25:25,040 --> 00:25:26,360
Mr Lou,

438
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:28,080
you should know

439
00:25:28,080 --> 00:25:30,520
I can't perform on the stage with makeup.

440
00:25:30,920 --> 00:25:32,160
So

441
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:34,120
if you can excuse our make up.

442
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,200
It's ok without makeup,

443
00:25:36,640 --> 00:25:38,720
but you have to wear costumes.

444
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:41,480
Then we'll know you're actors.

445
00:25:48,160 --> 00:25:49,560
I have to remind you

446
00:25:50,040 --> 00:25:52,760
the props are real.

447
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,800
Control yourself.

448
00:25:55,280 --> 00:25:57,720
Don't follow your mother

449
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:00,000
who couldn't tell what was true

450
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:02,480
from what was false

451
00:26:03,040 --> 00:26:04,320
when she indulged in performing.

452
00:26:08,120 --> 00:26:09,480
So will you let off my father

453
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:12,160
if I play?

454
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:16,400
Go get changed.

455
00:26:27,750 --> 00:26:32,460
♫ Concubine, follow me to fight our way out. ♫

456
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:43,330
♫ Your Majesty, ♫

♫ if we can fight our way out, ♫

459

♫ let's retreat to Jiangdong, ♫

461

00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,640
I think

470
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:02,920
we can see his mother's influence on him

Not bad.

487
00:29:07,960 --> 00:29:09,120
Bai Feili.

488
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,040
Bai Feili.

489
00:29:42,440 --> 00:29:44,440
It's me, Bai Feili. Let me in.

490
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:53,720
Bai Feili, if there's something,

491
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:55,800
we can talk.

492
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:58,040
Let me in.

493
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:16,440
Bai,

494
00:30:17,120 --> 00:30:18,640
you found me again.

495
00:30:22,160 --> 00:30:24,880
You can find me every time 
 when we play hide and seek.

496
00:30:26,080 --> 00:30:28,200
Did your performance go well today?

497
00:30:32,000 --> 00:30:35,360
How can it be? You've played well all the time.

498
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,960
Why are you bleeding?

499
00:30:40,120 --> 00:30:42,080
Costumes shouldn't stained by blood.

500
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:43,320
Come here.

501
00:30:44,680 --> 00:30:46,880
Mummy helps you cut off the part with blood.

502
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:50,000
You're always like this.

503
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:52,760
You think you can solve anything

504
00:30:53,120 --> 00:30:54,960
so you never ask for help.

505
00:30:55,360 --> 00:30:57,040
Being bullied by classmates,

506
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:59,080
you lied to me that

507
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:00,920
it was red ink.

508
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:04,280
I don't want to

509
00:31:05,480 --> 00:31:07,400
make you unhappy.

510
00:31:10,360 --> 00:31:12,920
I'm not happy because I'm sick,

511
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,360
it's not your fault.

512
00:31:17,640 --> 00:31:18,640
Why?

513
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:20,760
Why didn't you tell me you're sick?

514
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,840
What can you do if I told you?

515
00:31:25,520 --> 00:31:27,240

I dare not to see you,

520
00:31:44,080 --> 00:31:45,040

would sing and talk to him.

whether the two birds

He can lead a normal life

616
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,040

617

00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:31,920
I don't care whether he is normal or not,

620
00:39:32,920 --> 00:39:34,280
I just want to know

621
00:39:35,960 --> 00:39:37,040
how painful he is

622
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:39,960
to hide himself

624

I can understand

625
00:39:49,680 --> 00:39:52,120
why Bai chose you

626
00:39:52,120 --> 00:39:53,640
as his emergency contact.

627
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:58,720
At the patient's own request,

628
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:01,560
e wants to confide in you himself.

629
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:03,920
So I have to stop here.

it's all in the letter.

But, as a psychiatrist,

633
00:40:13,800 --> 00:40:16,080
I want to make it clear to you that

634
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,920
mental illness is just like

635

Don't think of it as something odd.

The patient

638
00:40:27,040 --> 00:40:29,400
keeps it a secret

639
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:31,440
because he's afraid of

640
00:40:31,440 --> 00:40:33,720
