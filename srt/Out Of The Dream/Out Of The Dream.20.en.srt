Such as, we go on a date.

85

but he leaves me on the street.

86
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,640

87

But this guy...

94
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,560
doesn't watch the weather forecast.

95
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:32,560

the family trouble,

110

and the birth of the demon child.

111
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,240
I think

112
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:15,920
he's the kind of person

113
00:08:15,920 --> 00:08:18,160
who forgets his wedding anniversary.

114
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:19,480
Or,

115
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
he takes his child to school

116
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,720
and leaves the schoolbag in the car.

117

00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:39,200
God forbid!

350
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,040
Yes,

351
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:43,360
what a pity!

352
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,040
The road is mine.

353
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:16,720
The tree is mine.

354
00:21:17,160 --> 00:21:18,960
If you want to go this way,

355
00:21:20,600 --> 00:21:21,720
come to dinner with me!

356
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,080
I need to practice.

357
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:27,560
I have no time to eat.

358
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:32,080
People are iron. Rice is steel.

359
00:21:32,080 --> 00:21:33,800
You will be hungry if you skip the meal.

360
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:36,080
Practice can't keep you from eating.

361
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:38,720
I'm busy now.

362
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:40,080
I'll treat you to dinner

363
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:40,800
when I'm done.

364
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:48,600
Do you want to go to the Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period?

365
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:50,640
If you want, come with me.

366
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,680
Just do me a favor.

367
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:58,920
Be quick.

368
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:00,360
No problem.

369
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,280
Get on.

370
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:03,640
Let's go.

371
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:04,440
Hang on!

372
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:12,120
Mr. Zhang,

373
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:13,720
tell me the truth.

374
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:14,640
What's going on

375
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:16,160
with my dad now?

376
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:33,720
You father,

377
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,560
he always wanted to get into the heavy asset projects.

378
00:22:36,920 --> 00:22:39,240
So he invested in Lou Shitang's mining projects

379
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:41,320
in Russia,

380
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:42,920
He set up a new company

381
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,920
and Zeng Qiu was the legal person.

382
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,440
Lou Shitang and Zeng Qiu

383
00:22:50,440 --> 00:22:52,040
have been in cahoots for a long time.

384
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:53,640
The worse part is,

385
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:56,120
in order to take the project as soon as possible,

386
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,680
your father pledged most of the Shang&Shan's assets,

387
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:00,960
and transferred them into the new company along with the cash.

388
00:23:01,040 --> 00:23:03,120
He made a special fund freeze.

389
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,880
But your father didn't expect Lou Shitang

390
00:23:06,120 --> 00:23:07,360
would take advantage of Shang&Shan's

391
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:09,600
cash flow break

392
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:12,040
to change the partner.

393
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:14,480
Your father,

394
00:23:14,720 --> 00:23:17,240
he wanted to ease the cash flow crisis,

395
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,960
so he took the risk

396
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,960
of illegal fund raising.

397
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,680
But don't worry.

398
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:30,440
I'll do my best to help your father.

399
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,040
Morning.

400
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:40,520
There you are. Come in, please.

401
00:23:41,320 --> 00:23:42,040
This way.

402
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:51,800
Be quick.

403
00:24:01,280 --> 00:24:02,640
There's a stage out there.

404
00:24:03,400 --> 00:24:04,720
Sometimes there are shows here.

405
00:24:10,360 --> 00:24:12,240
Nan Lao, do you remember?

406
00:24:12,600 --> 00:24:14,880
This tea...

407
00:24:15,000 --> 00:24:17,160
was picked from the mountain at the beginning of the year.

408
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,840
It's not a fancy tea.

409
00:24:20,080 --> 00:24:20,920
But,

410
00:24:21,160 --> 00:24:22,040
thirty-six peaks

411
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,360
and ninety-nine rocks

412
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:24,320
are hard to produce a fir.

413
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:25,800
One scent for one fir.

414
00:24:25,880 --> 00:24:26,920
Every fir is different.

415
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:29,720
It's even harder to meet what you like.

416
00:24:30,680 --> 00:24:32,760
Nan Lao, thank you for giving it to me.

417
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,280
Oh, it's nothing.

418
00:24:34,480 --> 00:24:36,360
The tea is meant for you.

419
00:24:36,360 --> 00:24:38,400
How can I take it from you.

420
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,920
Don't say that. Don't say that.

421
00:24:42,440 --> 00:24:43,440
Come here. Come in, please.

422
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,640
Miss Yu, come here. Please come in.

423
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:51,680
Come here. Sit down, please.

424
00:24:54,400 --> 00:24:55,320
Tea, please.

425
00:25:00,760 --> 00:25:01,360
Thank you.

426
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:04,560
Miss Yu,

427
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,840
this is Mr. Nan Huaiming.

428
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,000
He's been my best friend for more than a decade.

429
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:11,240
Of course I know Mr. Nan.

430
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,400
Nan Lao,

431
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:13,960
this is Miss Yu,

432
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,000
my new friend.

433
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:17,680
She specializes in senior male roles.

434
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:19,480
She's one single flower

435
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,640
that I hardly ever see.

436
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:23,240
I wonder if Nan Lao has heard of her.

437
00:25:24,280 --> 00:25:25,440
Yes.

438
00:25:27,480 --> 00:25:28,480
Miss Yu,

439
00:25:28,840 --> 00:25:30,000
would you like to

440
00:25:30,120 --> 00:25:31,040
sing a song

441
00:25:31,040 --> 00:25:32,320
to cheer everyone up?

442
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,600
-I...-She'd love to. She'd love to.

443
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,840
You sing that, A Moon.

444
00:25:38,560 --> 00:25:40,320
OK. OK.

445
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:42,600
Thank you very much.

446
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:44,440
This way, please.

447
00:25:52,750 --> 00:26:02,790
♫ Father and mother! ♫

448
00:26:04,790 --> 00:26:46,100
♫ A bright moon shines outside the window. ♫

449
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,280
Good!

450
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:49,640
Good!

451
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,000
Awesome!

452
00:26:52,760 --> 00:26:53,720
I'm really sorry.

453
00:26:53,720 --> 00:26:54,640
Lately,

454
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:56,280
there's been a lot going on.

455
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:57,800
I'm interrupting your free time.

456
00:26:57,800 --> 00:26:58,880
Sorry.

457
00:26:58,960 --> 00:26:59,920
No, no.

458
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:02,600
I'm really sorry.

459
00:27:02,600 --> 00:27:03,960
I have something to do.

460
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,920
That's all

461
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:08,040
-for today. -I have rehearsals.

462
00:27:08,640 --> 00:27:10,520
Xiao Dao, get things ready.

463
00:27:10,880 --> 00:27:11,320
OK.

464
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:12,800
Nan Lao, I've got some big dishes

465
00:27:12,800 --> 00:27:13,640
-No, no, no. -for you.

466
00:27:13,640 --> 00:27:14,680
I hope you don't mind.

467
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:15,560
OK.

468
00:27:15,680 --> 00:27:16,280
I must be going now.

469
00:27:16,280 --> 00:27:17,680
Nan Lao, where are you going? I'll have Xiao Dao see you off.

470
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,280
Xiao Dao. See him off.

471
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,480
Mr. Lou, I have rehearsals later,

472
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,840
so I gotta go.

473
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:28,800
Please wait a moment.

474
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:29,640
Wait a moment.

475
00:27:36,600 --> 00:27:39,160
I have a gift for you.

476
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:41,600
I bought this in an auction last week.

477
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,600
Although it's not worth much,

478
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:46,680
it means something.

479
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:48,960
This is the quill

480
00:27:48,960 --> 00:27:51,320
on the cap Meng Xiaodong used in Peking Opera.

481
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:53,040
I hope you like it.

482
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:54,720
No, Mr. Lou.

483
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,000
It's too expensive.

484
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:57,080
I can't accept it.

485
00:27:57,600 --> 00:27:58,840
Take it. It's not expensive.

486
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,080
Miss Yu,

487
00:28:03,520 --> 00:28:05,080
I got a word for you.

488
00:28:06,400 --> 00:28:08,360
May good wind arrive,

489
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:10,600
to help me succeed.

490
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:32,600
Thank you, Mr. Lou, for introducing me to Mr. Nan.

491
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:33,640
By the way,

492
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:34,880
Miss Yu,

493
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:36,400
don't forget your gift.

494
00:28:36,520 --> 00:28:38,760
Mr. Lou, I really can't take this gift.

495
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:39,760
Take it.

496
00:28:39,960 --> 00:28:42,400
If you don't like it, you can give it back to me next time.

497
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:43,920
-I, I... -I'm sure we'll meet again.

498
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:45,000
I have to leave now.

499
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:46,080
Let's go.

500
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:46,840
OK.

501
00:28:50,800 --> 00:28:52,360
How is it going? I picked you up with a scooter.

502
00:28:52,360 --> 00:28:53,920
And drive you back in a limo. Isn't that amazing?

503
00:28:54,080 --> 00:28:55,160
Cocky.

504
00:29:11,400 --> 00:29:12,440
Sorry.

505
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:14,680
I was just held up,

506
00:29:14,680 --> 00:29:15,040
so I am here late.

507
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:17,040
So you went to Lou Shitang...

508
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,640
Do you know Mr. Lou too?

509
00:29:20,160 --> 00:29:21,240
He talked to me

510
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:22,880
about the Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period.

511
00:29:23,080 --> 00:29:24,680
Looks like you got pretty close.

512
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,560
Actually I don't want to.

513
00:29:33,640 --> 00:29:34,720
Bai Feili,

514
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,240
I got the interview of the Golden Age of Spring and Autumn Period.

515
00:29:38,840 --> 00:29:39,960
Congratulations.

516
00:30:32,240 --> 00:30:33,720
Are you not gonna

517
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,200
take me the way ahead?

518
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,600
There're different views

519
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:54,320

Many people think opera

Nothing.

He may be in a bad mood.

Maybe I

00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:14,480
If both of them are selfish,

691
00:40:14,840 --> 00:40:16,880
it's a kind of balance.

692
00:40:17,200 --> 00:40:18,000
The most terrible thing

693
00:40:18,120 --> 00:40:20,440
is the infinite selfishness of one party.

694
00:40:20,880 --> 00:40:21,800
At the beginning,

695
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,760
he says something

696
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:23,760
to express gratitude.

697
00:40:24,200 --> 00:40:25,360
After a long time,

698
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,480
it will be normal.

699
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,080
He would think you should do that,

700
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:31,280
and you owe him that.

701
00:40:32,320 --> 00:40:33,920
Bai Feili is not such a man.

702
00:40:35,560 --> 00:40:36,640
I think

703
00:40:37,080 --> 00:40:38,920
maybe it was rehearsal,

704
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,280
or

705
00:40:40,520 --> 00:40:42,360
he was having a hard time.

706
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,560
That means,

707
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:46,680
he had a problem and he didn't tell you.

708
00:40:46,840 --> 00:40:48,400
Because he didn't want you to share it with him.

709
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:49,960
It's no different than a fight.

710
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:51,960
Cold violence. Selfish, too!

711
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:53,080
Wang Zhongqiang!

712
00:40:53,480 --> 00:40:55,160
You just want us to break up, don't you?

713
00:40:57,560 --> 00:40:59,360
That's not what I mean.

714
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:02,360
Don't argue with me.

715
00:41:03,360 --> 00:41:04,520
You two are acting like

716
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:06,080
a pair of living loaches right now.

717
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:10,000
Why loaches?

718
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:11,640
Look at me,

719
00:41:11,800 --> 00:41:13,280
how can I

720
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:13,840
imitate two creatures

721
00:41:13,840 --> 00:41:15,720
that get tangled with one hand?

722
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,080
Don't demand too much.

723
00:41:20,920 --> 00:41:22,200
I have a skeleton in the closet,

724
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:23,840
but I don't want to say.

725
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,480
I want to ask him why he was angry,

726
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:28,760
but I don't dare to ask.

727
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,320
I don't want to say.

728
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:33,440
I don't dare to ask.

729
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:40,440
This gesture.

730
00:41:40,720 --> 00:41:42,880
I heard our foreign host said it

731
00:41:43,320 --> 00:41:44,760
means good luck.

732
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:46,000
Good luck.

733
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,040
Good luck.

734
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:51,400
You mean good luck!

735
00:41:51,800 --> 00:41:52,640
The same. The same. The same.

736
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:53,720
That's what it means anyway.

737
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,280
Your English is so bad. Don't say it again.

738
00:41:59,760 --> 00:42:00,720
Anyway,

739
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,720
if you like someone,

740
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,560
you should accept his good and bad.

741
00:42:04,920 --> 00:42:06,360
But it doesn't mean there's gonna be no problems

742
00:42:06,520 --> 00:42:07,880
and you can't talk to him.

743
00:42:10,600 --> 00:42:11,480
Here comes my fish!

744
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,080
Come on!

745
00:42:16,760 --> 00:42:18,920
You're not a good fisherman.
