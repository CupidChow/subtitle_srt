I'm fine.

No, you must put on a band-aid.

Well, Mr. Chen,

49
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,400
in our industry,

50

we don't use our real names.

51
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:11,760
You can think of it as a stage name

or a pseudonym.

53
00:06:13,320 --> 00:06:16,160
But Mr. Chen, you really have a great eye for it.

Sir,

89

I heard what happened just now.

90
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,800
In order to express our apologies,

91
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:33,760
our restaurant

92
00:07:33,760 --> 00:07:35,200
has prepared this specialty specially for you.

93
00:07:41,159 --> 00:07:42,800
What kind of specialty is this?

94
00:07:45,880 --> 00:07:47,600
Legend has it that in ancient times,

95
00:07:47,600 --> 00:07:48,880
the Yellow River flooded.

96
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,680
Dayu constructed Yukou to dredge water,

97
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,280
But it caused the carp

98
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:54,960
to be washed out of the river,

99
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,840
and could no longer go upstream.

100
00:07:56,840 --> 00:07:59,159
So the carp turned to the Jade Emperor to protest,

101
00:07:59,760 --> 00:08:00,920
and the Jade Emperor decreed,

102
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:03,080
anyone who could jump through the gap

103
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,200
would turn into a flying dragon

104
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:07,040
and rise to the sky.

105
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,760
This is...

106
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:12,720
This is the specialty of our restaurant.

107
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:13,880
The carp leaping over the dragon gate.

108
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:16,720
This is the guardian beast of our "Dragon Scale".

109
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,400
You are not from this restaurant.

110
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:21,200
Nice to meet you,

111
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:22,880
I am the founder of Jiubai,

Guanshan Qianchong.

113
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:29,360
So it's you

114
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,960
who

115
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:33,240
I waited for the whole night last time.

116
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,799
It was my fault last time,

117
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,400
I apologize to you.

118
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:44,080
It's a very good idea,

119
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:46,160
but it's a bit small.

120
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,920
This is just a model.

121
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:49,560
My plan

122
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:51,200
is to put the whole stage

123
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,640
in a box like this.

124
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:55,120
You are just a start-up company

125
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:56,760
Can you make it?

126
00:08:56,760 --> 00:08:58,440
Technically

127
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,080
there is no problem at all.

128
00:09:00,520 --> 00:09:03,080
It just needs to spare a lot of effort

129
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:04,520
on the pre-design.

130
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,600
But this is exactly

131
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:07,720
what our Jiubai Studio

132
00:09:07,720 --> 00:09:09,040
is good at.

133
00:09:11,080 --> 00:09:12,680
The same amount of money

134
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:15,120
can be spent on this,

135
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:18,520
or on that.

136
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:22,440
Maybe you can't make a decision for the time being,

137
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,280
so

138
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:27,240
I am willing to sign the contract and receive the deposit

139
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:29,760
after the initial inspection is passed.

140
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:32,480
There is no guarantee

141
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:33,840
for your early investment.

142
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,840
If you want to have them all,

143
00:09:36,840 --> 00:09:39,040
you must first go all-in.

144
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:41,360
Courageous!

145
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:42,920
Great.

146
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:48,400
May a happy cooperation.

147

154
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:08,600

Liu Xichan.

157
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:44,440
How does your clerk work in your restaurant?

158
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:45,520
Why doesn't she watch where she's going!

159
00:10:46,520 --> 00:10:48,760
What can I do for you, lady?

160
00:10:49,160 --> 00:10:50,040
Manager,

161
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:51,960
why do you ask her for taking the dishes?

162
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:54,240
She is an opera singer,

163
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:55,440
I want to listen to her singing.

164
00:10:56,840 --> 00:10:58,440
You're kidding me.

165
00:10:58,440 --> 00:11:00,640
She is the one who cleans up and washes the dishes.

166
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:02,560
How can she sing opera?

167
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:07,920
It's okay if she doesn't want to sing,

168
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:09,680
but I want to see that.

169
00:11:12,080 --> 00:11:13,920
OK, I'll call someone over.

170
00:11:14,280 --> 00:11:15,080
No,

171
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:17,640
I want to see her play.

172
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:21,200
You're kidding me again.

173
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:22,400
The playing of that pot

174
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:24,200
can't be learnt in a day or two.

175
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,680
And the water in the pot is very hot and dangerous.

176
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:31,680
I know she is versatile.

177
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:32,840
She can do everything,

178
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:34,680
can't she?

179
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,320
Today

180
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:43,920
I'm going to drink the tea she pours.

181
00:11:46,080 --> 00:11:48,040
It's simply a matter of pouring tea.

182
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,280
It's so easy.

183
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,600
Can you?

184
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:54,400
I've watched it so many days...

185
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,120
It's nothing difficult.

186
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,640
This is not a joke.

187
00:11:57,960 --> 00:11:59,000
Manager,

188
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,920
you should stand aside

189
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,240
lest it hurts you.

190
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:04,240
Guanshan!

191
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:06,440
Are you alright?

192
00:13:07,320 --> 00:13:09,120
Let's go to see the doctor.

193
00:13:11,280 --> 00:13:12,360
Let's go.

194
00:13:13,000 --> 00:13:14,080
Go.

195
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,160
Guanshan,

196
00:13:17,280 --> 00:13:18,480
don't go.

197
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,320
How's the preparation going?

198
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:30,280
You rest assured.

199
00:13:30,640 --> 00:13:31,560
Today we've prepared

200
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,320
all the foreign DJ's favorites.

201
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:34,440
I'm sure he can feel our enthusiasm

202
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:35,880
as soon as he comes in.

203
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:38,840
All the tables have been ordered today,

204
00:13:38,840 --> 00:13:40,920
They are all coming for this foreign DJ.

205
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:42,640
If you serve them well,

206
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:44,120
30% of all the wine ordered tonight

207
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:45,760
will count as your salary.

208
00:13:46,320 --> 00:13:47,320
Thanks, manager.

209
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,560
Manager, bad news.

210
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:51,240
The foreign DJ can't arrive today.

211
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:52,840
What's the matter?

212
00:13:53,280 --> 00:13:54,320
I don't know.

213
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:56,800
Hello?

214
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:01,000
The foreign DJ must want a fee increase.

215
00:14:01,640 --> 00:14:03,320
Xiao Chuan, don't worry.

216
00:14:03,720 --> 00:14:04,840
Even if I tie him up today,

217
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,440
I will tie him over on time.

218
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,800
No need.

219
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:13,040
He is already on the plane.

220
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,600
I warned you,

221
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,920
we could't afford to offend Tian Wei.

222
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,720
He gave the foreign DJ five times the money,

223
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,320
asking him to go back home tonight.

224
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:24,120
And he said that

225
00:14:24,120 --> 00:14:25,560
there will be him without you.

226
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,400
He will drive you out of late-night jobs.

227
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:46,760
Hang in there.

228
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:50,360
It charges

229
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:51,800
if you see a human specimen.

230
00:14:51,800 --> 00:14:52,800
Okay.

231
00:14:53,520 --> 00:14:55,280
I'll buy you for an hour first.

232
00:14:59,800 --> 00:15:00,800
Here you are.

233
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:04,480
Is my price cheaper than pork!

234
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:06,560
If you don't want it then give it back to me.

235
00:15:11,680 --> 00:15:12,920
You can scan my QR code to pay.

236
00:15:14,520 --> 00:15:16,160
You treat me stupid!

237
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:17,440
I can tell the difference

238
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,240
between the ID code and payment code of WeChat.

239
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:21,320
Childish.

240
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:24,240
It's not too much

241
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,920
of our relationship to leave contact information.

242
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:29,520
What kind of our relationship is?

243
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:31,720
You and I...

244
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,600
have...

245
00:15:34,960 --> 00:15:36,760
have met many times.

246
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,920
I need to visit Shuji too.

247
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:43,760
What kind of bad luck is going on these days!

248
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:45,480
Since I met you,

249
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,840
I'm so miserable,

250
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,040
and lost my job today.

251
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,640
Remember I'm the injured person.

252
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,600
Who asked you to flaunt your superiority?

253
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,320
So you wanted to be splashed with boiling water?

254
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:00,480
You...

255
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:02,320
Rapscallion.

256
00:16:03,840 --> 00:16:05,320
Do you have any more

257
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:06,720
old-fashioned curse words?

258
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:09,200
What did you say?

259
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:11,080
Sorry.

260
00:16:11,080 --> 00:16:12,360
Let me take a look.

261
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,640
It's alright, It's alright.

262
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:15,800
It's just a little injury.

263
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:30,720
In Suzhou,

264
00:16:31,640 --> 00:16:33,200
why didn't you open the door?

265
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:41,280
Sorry.

266
00:16:42,080 --> 00:16:43,560
I'm asking you why.

267
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:45,800
I don't want you to say sorry.

268
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:48,480
Actually I... 
 Forget it.

269
00:16:49,520 --> 00:16:50,800
Let's skip it.

270
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:53,880
No matter what kind of reason you give,

271
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:54,920
I can't forgive you

272
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,480
for this matter.

273
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,040
I've already changed meds for you.

274
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:03,800
I'm leaving.

275
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,920
The doctor said you should change the meds every two hours.

276
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:08,119
You can change it yourself then.

277
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:10,240
Hang on a minute.

278
00:17:11,079 --> 00:17:12,040
What's the matter?

279
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,440
Xiao cang

280
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:18,359
crawled into your bag just now.

281
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,359
Xiao Cang?

282
00:17:21,359 --> 00:17:22,800
Who is Xiao Cang?

283
00:17:27,880 --> 00:17:29,280
Your little hamster

284
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:30,520
does the same thing as you,

285
00:17:30,840 --> 00:17:32,840
and even eats small tomatoes.

286
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,400
I

287
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,200
am hurt

288
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:39,160
so I can't cut it now.

289
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:42,960
After you finish cutting it, I will send you home.

290
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:45,960
You're like this now, saying send me home?

291
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,640
Neither of us will be safe.

292
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,240
How dare you raise the animal

293
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:52,880
without knowing how to raise yourself.

294
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:55,440
When we established Jiubai,

295
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,840
we decided to raise a hamster

296
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,120
in the studio.

297
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,680
The life span of a hamster is about two to three years.

298
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:02,680
It's almost

299
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:04,480
the life of an antique stage play group.

300
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,280
It's like many people

301
00:18:06,280 --> 00:18:08,400
formed their bands in college

302
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:11,280
and disbanded when they graduated.

303
00:18:11,920 --> 00:18:13,720
What we are doing

304
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:15,480
is

305
00:18:15,800 --> 00:18:17,040
probably something

306
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:18,880
that most people

307
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,400
will never do after adolescence.

308
00:18:23,040 --> 00:18:24,640
Xiao Cang reminds us

309
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:27,680
that everything has a cycle.

310
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:29,960
We should do our best,

311
00:18:29,960 --> 00:18:31,560
for what we love in the heart.

312
00:18:32,160 --> 00:18:35,240
As long as Xiao Cang is still running in this running wheel,

313
00:18:35,680 --> 00:18:37,000
we

314
00:18:37,000 --> 00:18:38,760
will not slack off for a moment.

315
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,440
If we have been doing what we love,

316
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,080
our adolescence may never pass.

317
00:18:53,160 --> 00:18:54,240
Yu Fei.

318
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,120
Join Jiubai.

319
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:59,640
You are destined to stand on stage.

320
00:19:03,560 --> 00:19:04,640
No wonder you

321
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:07,000
made an exception for love

322
00:19:07,000 --> 00:19:08,320
and find resonance.

323
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:12,880
You still have to call me to play Liu Xichan.

324
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:15,400
I don't think so.

325
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:16,840
Didn't you go to the Chinese Opera Academy

326
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:18,760
for a stage?

327
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:21,080
Join Jiubai.

328
00:19:21,320 --> 00:19:22,080
For this period,

329
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:24,120
we can not only give you a stage,

330
00:19:24,560 --> 00:19:26,840
but also give you a job to feed yourself.

331
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:28,760
Let's forget it.

332
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:31,000
I'm going to take the exam soon.

333
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:32,880
My English is still far behind.

334
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,960
I can teach you.

335
00:19:34,520 --> 00:19:36,640
Your lessons are too expensive. I can't afford it.

336
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,280
Deduct from your salary.

337
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,160
You took out the money just now

338
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:43,600
and soon get it back in your pocket.

339
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,600
You really know how to settle the bill.

340
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:47,480
I don't think like that.

341
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:49,840
Whatever.

342
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,680
I'm leaving after cutting these tomatoes.

343
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:56,120
Is my bracelet with you?

344
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:00,680
Would it be hard to see you again

345
00:20:01,960 --> 00:20:03,640
if I return the bracelet to you?

346
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:09,040
That bracelet is very important

347
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:10,560
to me.

348
00:20:14,040 --> 00:20:15,240
I'll go get it.

349
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:28,880
Miss donor, I watched the stars in the sky,

350
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:31,400
and found you have good luck in adventure with a man.

351
00:20:31,400 --> 00:20:33,080
To unlock more information,

352
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:35,040
only takes two yuan.

353
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:40,240
To shut you up.

354
00:20:42,560 --> 00:20:43,600
Miss donor,

355
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,880
have you ever thought about

356
00:20:44,880 --> 00:20:48,360
your lion is strong and powerful, not in appearance

357
00:20:48,360 --> 00:20:49,960
but in heart.

358
00:20:53,320 --> 00:20:55,160
What's the guff!

359
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,840
It's really unlucky to meet him.

360
00:21:10,760 --> 00:21:12,040
Bai Feili.

361
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:16,160
What's wrong?

362
00:21:16,560 --> 00:21:18,520
I have cut all the tomatoes.

363
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:20,880
Give me the bracelet.

364
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:21,640
I'm leaving.

365
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:24,160
By the way, do you have band-aids?

366
00:21:24,160 --> 00:21:25,600
I accidentally cut my finger

367
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,920
when I just cut the tomatoes.

368
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,600
I want a band-aid from you.

369
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:36,000
If you don't have one, I'll rinse it with water.

370
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,880
Wait a moment.

371
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,320
What's wrong?

372
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,320
What's the matter?

373
00:21:47,320 --> 00:21:48,280
Are you alright?

374
00:21:57,800 --> 00:21:59,240
Is it bleeding?

375
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:02,440
Open the door!

376
00:22:06,240 --> 00:22:07,480
Bai Feili.

377
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:18,320
He won't be fainted, right?

378
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:21,240
Bai Feili, what's wrong with you, how are you?

379
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:22,960
Open the door!

380
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:37,320
Save him is the most important thing.

381
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:42,200
One, two, three.

382
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:46,800
Are you alright?

383
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,040
Are you okay?

384
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:48,880
What happened?

385
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:50,960
Bai Feili, Bai Feili!

386
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:09,000
Yu Fei, why haven't you come back?

387
00:23:09,000 --> 00:23:10,640
Where have you been?

388
00:23:16,120 --> 00:23:18,320
Why didn't you tell me you'll faint at the sight of blood?

389
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,680
Are you alright?

390
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,800
I'll get some water for you.

391
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,280
Don't go.

392
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:36,480
I am here.

393
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:46,560
Just in case,

394
00:23:46,560 --> 00:23:47,960
before you sleep,

395
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,200
what else do I need to prepare for you?

396
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:52,440
Nothing.

397
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:56,360
I'm just a little cold now.

398
00:23:57,040 --> 00:23:58,080
Cold...

399
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,040
Do you have a fever?

400
00:24:01,400 --> 00:24:02,680
Cover the quilt.

401
00:24:05,200 --> 00:24:07,360
Do you have a thermometer at home?

402
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,400
I'm so cold.

403
00:25:01,400 --> 00:25:02,560
To sum it up,

404
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,280
it's fun indeed,

405
00:25:05,280 --> 00:25:06,720
but not the best.

406
00:25:06,720 --> 00:25:09,080
I'll take you to the most interesting place next time.

407
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:10,200
This weekend,

408
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,720
I will bring you a surprise.

409
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:12,640
Guess what?

410
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,960
I'll take you to see our favorite

411
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:16,360
Emperor Zhengde.

412
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:19,320
How is it, am I sweet?

413
00:25:19,320 --> 00:25:21,960
So sweet, I haven't listened to it for a long time.

414
00:25:21,960 --> 00:25:23,800
My ears are almost drooling.

415
00:25:23,800 --> 00:25:26,840
What medicine do I have to buy you for drooling ears?

416
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:29,160
To reward you for being so sweet to me,

417
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,520
I'll make delicious food for you.

418
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,120
You don't need to do this.

419
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:33,880
No need, no need.

420
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:37,120
What do you mean?

421
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,120
You don't want to eat the delicious food I make for you.

422
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:40,040
No, no, no.

423
00:25:40,040 --> 00:25:42,480
My baby, you misunderstood me again.

424
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:43,760
I mean...

425
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,800
This guy,

426
00:25:44,800 --> 00:25:45,800
why didn't he tell me earlier of someone is at home?

427
00:25:45,800 --> 00:25:47,320
Nothing hard about this.

428
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,520
Cooking is my hobby and my strength.

429
00:25:51,160 --> 00:25:53,960
Right, right, right, you are right.

430
00:25:55,120 --> 00:25:56,520
No, no.

431
00:26:00,520 --> 00:26:01,880
What's wrong? Why can't it open?

432
00:26:02,080 --> 00:26:04,120
Can't open? How can it be possible?

433
00:26:04,120 --> 00:26:06,120
Let me try.

434
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:11,640
What's going on?

435
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:13,040
Is there a ghost?

436
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:14,240
What the hell is that?

437
00:26:14,680 --> 00:26:15,840
Superstitious.

438
00:26:16,800 --> 00:26:18,080
Then there's a thief.

439
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,400
It is possible.

440
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,040
Watch me.

441
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:22,760
Wait for me.

442
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,160
Let's do it together.

443
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:26,240
I'll call one, two, three.

444
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,440
One, two.

445
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:30,520
Wait.

446
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,760
Why haven't there been any tacit understanding for so many years?

447
00:26:40,600 --> 00:26:43,760
Hurry, hurry, hurry, look, a woman,

448
00:26:43,760 --> 00:26:45,440
carrying a big cloth bag.

449
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:46,600
It's a woman.

450
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:49,440
Woman, woman?

451
00:26:52,400 --> 00:26:54,000
It's not the right time

452
00:26:54,000 --> 00:26:55,520
for us to come back, right?

453
00:26:56,720 --> 00:26:57,920
A woman!

454
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,640
So far so good.

455
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,440
I, this...

456
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,000
Understand, adult business.

457
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,200
I totally understand.

458
00:27:20,560 --> 00:27:25,240
I take a step forward and take an unusual path.

459
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:26,920
Do I misunderstand?

460
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:47,000
Mr. Shang, Mrs. Shan, your grandson is still fine.

461
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,080
No need to pay your homage to the remains.

462
00:27:50,040 --> 00:27:51,240
How's it going?

463
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:52,560
Seeing us,

464
00:27:52,560 --> 00:27:54,960
do you feel very disappointed?

465
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:01,880
Don't bother looking for her.

466
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,640
She is gone.

467
00:28:04,880 --> 00:28:07,880
We bumped into her.

468
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:09,440
Her style is very wild.

469
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,720
She didn't leave from the front door, she jumped through the window

470
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:13,440
under which I planted many roses.

471
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:14,600
All barbed.

472
00:28:14,600 --> 00:28:15,800
Very dangerous.

473
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:17,960
When I called you yesterday,

474
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:19,400
you still said you don't have a girlfriend.

475
00:28:20,160 --> 00:28:21,080
Confess to us.

476
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:22,160
I indeed don't have one.

477
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:24,640
So, who is that girl?

478
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,040
You misunderstood me.

479
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:28,200
Misunderstood?

480
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:29,680
How could we misunderstand you?

481
00:28:29,680 --> 00:28:31,720
I clearly watched her running out from here.

482
00:28:31,720 --> 00:28:33,080
She flicked her long hair

483
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:34,360
and looks beautiful.

484
00:28:34,360 --> 00:28:36,200
Like that band you love.

485
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,320
The Guns and Roses.

486
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:39,600
Guns and Roses.

487
00:28:39,600 --> 00:28:40,480
Yes, yes, yes.

488
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,800
Like the hair of those lads.

489
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,000
No, no way.

490
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:48,520
No way.

491
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:50,960
Actually, we are still very enlightened.

492
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,240
If you have other options,

493
00:28:53,240 --> 00:28:54,120
we...

494
00:28:56,040 --> 00:28:57,240
You do misunderstand.

495
00:28:57,640 --> 00:28:58,560
It's a girl.

496
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:00,640
A girl.

497
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:02,400
Who's that?

498
00:29:04,520 --> 00:29:06,520
Didn't you say that you will come back tomorrow?

499
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:08,960
We temporarily endorsed the tickets.

500
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,760
We just wanted to give you a surprise.

501
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:13,120
We went back at once after we finished the speech.

502
00:29:13,120 --> 00:29:14,120
Speech?

503
00:29:14,120 --> 00:29:15,520
-Yes. 
 -You went to Antarctica and gave a speech.

504
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:16,360
Of course.

505
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:17,640
The penguin was basking in the sun,

506
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:18,640
woken up by you two

507
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:20,320
and had to listen to your speech.

508
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:21,680
You don't know.

509
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,400
You haven't seen real penguins

510
00:29:23,400 --> 00:29:25,080
walking in a line.

511
00:29:26,120 --> 00:29:27,560
Very beautiful.

512
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:30,560
Here, grandpa brings you an Antarctic gift.

513
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,240
Snow turned to water.

514
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:35,880
You didn't figure it out.

515
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:38,200
He changed your topic on purpose.

516
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:39,080
Did he?

517
00:29:39,080 --> 00:29:40,800
It's wrong for you to do this.

518
00:29:40,800 --> 00:29:43,160
You don't have any gentlemanliness.

519
00:29:43,160 --> 00:29:45,240
Why don't you invite the girl to have breakfast after a night.

520
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,240
Whoever do this are all scumbags.

521
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,760
Yes, this is improper.

522
00:29:48,160 --> 00:29:49,360
Call her back.

523
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:51,120
We'll make it up for you.

524
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:51,920
Yes, yes, yes.

525
00:29:51,920 --> 00:29:53,640
Call her back, call her back.

526
00:29:53,960 --> 00:29:55,440
Here are all gifts inside the bag.

527
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:56,680
Take your time and have a look.

528
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,480
Call her back!

529
00:30:37,040 --> 00:30:39,480
Did you owe rent and get kicking out again?

530
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,480
Why didn't you come back?

531
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,440
You didn't answer the phone and the WeChat messages all night.

532
00:30:47,040 --> 00:30:48,840
I thought something happened to you.

533
00:30:50,010 --> 00:30:51,760
[Missed calls: Mighty Dao Brother 15]

534
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:53,440
I'm sorry.

535
00:30:53,800 --> 00:30:55,800
I was a little busy and didn't check my phone.

536
00:30:56,280 --> 00:30:57,320
Nothing important.

537
00:30:57,320 --> 00:30:58,960
Why didn't you come back if there is nothing important?

538
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,040
Ummm...

539
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:03,440
Something private.

540
00:31:06,880 --> 00:31:08,720
Why are your clothes torn like this?

541
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,960
Wei Sir, again.

542
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:13,200
I went to apologize to him.

543
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,680
But as I didn't finish my words, he...

544
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:16,480
Why did you fight again?

545
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,120
Didn't you promise not to fight again?

546
00:31:18,680 --> 00:31:19,880
You are an adult.

547
00:31:19,880 --> 00:31:21,600
You should learn from others to be stable.

548
00:31:22,920 --> 00:31:23,920
Learn from whom?

549
00:31:24,400 --> 00:31:26,080
You don't like me anymore, right?

550
00:31:27,280 --> 00:31:28,760
In your heart, I'm just a bastard

551
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:30,920
who fights all day long.

552
00:31:31,440 --> 00:31:33,080
I'm not.

553
00:31:33,080 --> 00:31:35,320
Your favorite saying when you were young

554
00:31:35,320 --> 00:31:37,280
was don't fight if you can deal with it by talking.

555
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:40,640
This time you lost the fight and came back for help.

556
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:43,320
Tell me, who hit you?

557
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:44,720
I'll take you to revenge, let's go!

558
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:45,680
Yes.

559
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:48,000
I'm a gangster, bastard.

560
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,080
I have no work or business all day long.

561
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:52,120
Apart from fighting, the only thing I do is caring about you.

562
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:53,560
I wouldn't forget to come to you with supper even I lost the fight.

563
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
I would wait at your door if I couldn't find you.

564
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,040
I have been waiting for you the whole night.

565
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:00,600
What's wrong with you today?

566
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:01,880
Did you take dynamite?

567
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,160
No, I don't.

568
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:04,080
I'm the dynamite.

569
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:04,760
D-Y-N-A-M-I-T-E.

570
00:32:04,760 --> 00:32:05,640
Stay away from me.

571
00:32:05,640 --> 00:32:06,640
Be careful not to blow you up.

572
00:32:12,920 --> 00:32:14,000
I'm leaving.

573
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:16,120
Eat something before you leave.

574
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:20,920
He must 'on his period'.

575
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:10,440
Here, have some food.

576
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,280
I wanted to eat it last week but now I don't.

577
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:19,320
I took the project of "Dragon Scale".

578
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:20,760
I knew.

579
00:33:20,760 --> 00:33:21,920
The contract was sent

580
00:33:21,920 --> 00:33:23,240
last night.

581
00:33:24,760 --> 00:33:25,920
I told you

582
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,080
that the project I lost

583
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,400
will definitely be back.

584
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,560
Those who I lost

585
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:33,160
will be found as well.

586
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:36,720
Alright, I forgive you.

587
00:33:41,720 --> 00:33:43,080
After all,

588
00:33:43,520 --> 00:33:45,320
I should say sorry to you.

589
00:33:46,560 --> 00:33:48,440
Our studio is called Jiubai,

590
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:51,080
belonging to Guan Zhijiu and Bai Feili.

591
00:33:52,160 --> 00:33:54,720
and also belonging to Wuchang, Mengru, Guideng,

592
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:57,520
Mafang, Zhuangsheng, Haoshi and all of us.

593
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,280
I shouldn't be so stubborn

594
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,320
and shouldn't

595
00:34:01,320 --> 00:34:02,680
be so self-righteous.

596
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:06,960
You are a good boy to correct the mistake immediately.

597
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:11,120
Let's go, find a place to eat.

598
00:34:23,440 --> 00:34:24,639
Everyone,

599
00:34:24,760 --> 00:34:26,120
rehearsal at ten o'clock.

600
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:27,880
One minute late,

601
00:34:27,880 --> 00:34:29,040
one hundred yuan will be deducted in salary.

602
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:30,440
No way, my boss.

603
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,239
You play too hard in the morning.

604
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:34,120
Do you have any opinions?

605
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,960
No, no, no, I dare not.

606
00:34:35,960 --> 00:34:38,639
It's just been a long time since I saw such a boss.

607
00:34:38,639 --> 00:34:40,159
Speaking of it, the last time you were like this

608
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,639
was because of Liu Xichan.

609
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,159
Forget it, I'll shut up.

610
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:48,239
Radish or cabbage, each to his own delight.

611
00:34:48,239 --> 00:34:51,480
I like Radish and cabbage.

612
00:34:52,040 --> 00:34:54,560
More sugar?

613
00:34:54,560 --> 00:34:56,679
Salt is not enough.

614
00:34:57,200 --> 00:34:58,520
Have a taste, have a taste.

615
00:34:58,520 --> 00:35:01,000
-It must be delicious. 
 -It's over.

616
00:35:01,120 --> 00:35:02,440
Nutritious breakfast.

617
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,880
-It's over. 
 -Healthy and hearty.

618
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,720
Stop!

619
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:09,600
Where do you want to go?

620
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,560
Die together or go together.

621
00:35:14,360 --> 00:35:15,760
I'm still young.

622
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:18,760
I'm old but I can also elope.

623
00:35:21,080 --> 00:35:23,160
You have to eat breakfast before leaving.

624
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,320
Yes, yes.

625
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,600
Two gentlemen, let's start.

626
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,920
Black rice and purple sweet potato with red beans

627
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:39,640
can build your bodies.

628
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:43,560
Black rice, purple sweet potato, red, red beans.

629
00:35:43,560 --> 00:35:44,960
The red beans grow in southern land.

630
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:50,880
The red beans grow in southern land. The greatest love they do convey.

631
00:35:51,560 --> 00:35:55,320
The girl last time, she was...

632
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:57,560
Mrs. Shan,

633
00:35:57,960 --> 00:35:59,400
I am allergic to red beans.

634
00:36:01,640 --> 00:36:03,400
Black rice is also good,

635
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:05,560
which is rich in protein.

636
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:07,560
Both dietary fiber

637
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,120
and mineral content

638
00:36:09,120 --> 00:36:11,160
are very rich, right?

639
00:36:11,160 --> 00:36:12,040
I guess, I guess

640

The girl last time,

642
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,200
she likes black rice also.

643
00:36:16,200 --> 00:36:18,200
Really? Is black rice so good?

644
00:36:18,200 --> 00:36:18,800
Yes.

645
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:20,320
I'll feed the magpies with it later.

646
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,120
And purple sweet potato.

647
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:23,480
Purple sweet potato is better.

648
00:36:23,480 --> 00:36:26,040
Purple sweet potato...only belongs to...

649
00:36:26,600 --> 00:36:28,200
Only belongs to you.

650
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:29,040
Right?

651
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:30,720
This is your girls' favorite expression right now,

652
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:32,960
right?

653
00:36:32,960 --> 00:36:35,280
The girl last time

654
00:36:35,280 --> 00:36:37,120
-may be like it... 
 -Mr. Shang.

655
00:36:38,200 --> 00:36:40,040
It is not funny.

656
00:36:40,040 --> 00:36:41,160
Not funny?

657
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:43,040
Yes.

658
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,280
Do you eat or not?

659
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,320
Do you eat or not?

660
00:36:47,320 --> 00:36:47,960
She is asking you.

661
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:48,760
When

662
00:36:48,760 --> 00:36:49,920
will you take the girl back home?

663
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:50,840
And we can eat together.

664
00:36:51,320 --> 00:36:53,120
Where do I have a girl...

665
00:37:00,720 --> 00:37:01,600
Right,

666
00:37:03,160 --> 00:37:04,640
she

667
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,640
is not an ordinary girl.

668
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:09,560
She is your

669
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:12,320
granddaughter-in-law.

670
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:13,680
You do have!

671
00:37:16,800 --> 00:37:18,800
You have already...

672
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:21,080
That's all the matter in the future.

673
00:37:21,760 --> 00:37:23,000
I am going to find her now.

674
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:24,880
Take your time.

675
00:37:24,880 --> 00:37:25,520
I'm leaving.

676
00:37:27,080 --> 00:37:28,280
So wonderful.

677
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,800
You can leave now

678
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:32,080
but you have to bring her back in three days.

679
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:32,720
Three days.

680
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,200
Let us see, three days to bring her back.

681
00:37:35,520 --> 00:37:37,280
You must bring her back within three days.

682
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:42,920
Within three days.

[Jiubai]

684

Three minutes and two seconds.

00:38:01,280 --> 00:38:02,480
What is there to applaud for?

686
00:38:02,760 --> 00:38:06,160
Boss, I think it's okay for two more seconds, right?

687
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:08,840
Besides, within three minutes is really too...

688
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:11,560
Too achievable!

689
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,080
Too achievable!

690
00:38:13,880 --> 00:38:16,080
Accompaniment refers to game publishing BGM.

691
00:38:17,160 --> 00:38:18,720
The biggest selling point of "Dragon Scale" is Deja vu

692
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:20,640
and feelings, which must not be let go.

693
00:38:21,600 --> 00:38:23,560
Samples must be released within today.

694
00:38:25,400 --> 00:38:26,160
Guideng.

695
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,560
Why did you add this action?

696
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:35,000
Who of you explain it to me?

697
00:38:35,000 --> 00:38:37,000
I just want to add some small movements

698
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:39,800
to represent some delicate changes.

699
00:38:40,080 --> 00:38:42,240
It looks very delicate now.

700
00:38:42,760 --> 00:38:44,320
But our rehearsal room

701
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,800
is an area of 20 square meters.

702
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:48,360
The stage at that time is 200 square meters.

703
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,560
The closest distance between you and the audience is 20 meters.

704
00:38:51,080 --> 00:38:53,000
So is this kind of action to be shown to the audience

705
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,600
or to the pillars next to you?

706
00:38:56,480 --> 00:38:59,040
Mengru, bring my script.

707
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,360
I suggest you discuss with Mengru

708
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,440
and modify the script.

709
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:07,440
"Dragon Scale" is our first

710
00:39:07,440 --> 00:39:08,480
commercial project,

711
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,000
but we can't lower our standards.

712
00:39:13,600 --> 00:39:14,760
How about clothing?

713
00:39:15,280 --> 00:39:16,960
Why didn't you put on the clothes?

714
00:39:18,760 --> 00:39:20,200
Coming, coming, coming.

715
00:39:21,600 --> 00:39:22,640
Here.

716
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:29,960
Boss, this is the newly made fabric.

717
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:31,840
Did you see?

718
00:39:32,360 --> 00:39:33,480
His actions just now

719
00:39:33,480 --> 00:39:35,400
can be seen clearly by the audience.

720
00:39:35,800 --> 00:39:37,320
From now on,

721
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:38,760
after three hours,

722
00:39:39,000 --> 00:39:40,360
we'll rehearsal as dressed up.

723
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:42,440
Got it.

724
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,920
OK.

725
00:39:46,920 --> 00:39:48,240
Do you think the boss

726
00:39:48,680 --> 00:39:51,240
is extraordinarily perverted,

727
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:54,360
moody, and emotional today?

728
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:55,760
So

729
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:57,600
there is only one truth.

730
00:39:57,600 --> 00:39:58,880
Could it be...

731
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:00,760
As expected...

732
00:40:00,760 --> 00:40:03,960
Love gone wrong with relationship crisis.

733
00:40:12,020 --> 00:40:13,120

[Friends Request]

735
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,440
Is it so difficult

736
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,880
to accept my friend request?
