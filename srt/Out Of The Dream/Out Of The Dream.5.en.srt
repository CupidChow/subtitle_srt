00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,240
Hello!

5
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:43,680
Welcome to X Club. A trendy place

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,680
to enjoy life. Hi.

7
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,080
The carriage was slow in the past.

8
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:52,479
The letter was far away.

9
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:53,840
It was only enough to love one person in a lifetime.

10
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,800
You actually came to Shanghai for a friend

11
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:57,200
who isn't even your girlfriend. Hello.

12
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:59,080
Human's emotional world

13
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,600
is rich and modish.

14
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:02,080
You're a college student

15
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:03,520
who isn't staying at home.

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,200
Why are you having a hard time here?

17
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:06,800
I have a friend named Zhang Yituo

18
00:02:06,800 --> 00:02:07,800
who came here

19
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,639
and found love.

20
00:02:09,639 --> 00:02:10,639
He's even willing to betray the Earth

21
00:02:10,639 --> 00:02:11,760
to be together.

22
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:13,160
He said

23
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:14,520
it's vibrant here and

24
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,360
there're great food.

25
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,120
Thinking that I don't need to eat dirt anymore,

26
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:19,280
I came in secret.

27
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:21,440
But now I lost my keys.

28
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,480
Hello. Club X.

29
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,720
I don't know how to get back.

30
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,760
So you came to work in the club.

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:26,680
Hello.

32
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:27,880
To experience life？

33
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,400
I've been making a living for a long time

34
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,800
and I'm good at judging people.

35
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:35,720
You

36
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:37,600
are very suspicious.

37
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,840
Only the shuttle bus of Club X

38
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,880
can reach my home.

39
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:45,520
You...

40
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,520
because of the shuttle bus?

41
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:48,040
Yes.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:49,200
Dao Ge,

43
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,560
don't look down on yourself.

44
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,280
Every job matters.

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:53,960
Previously, I

46
00:02:54,079 --> 00:02:55,840
was a helper at the back kitchen.

47
00:02:56,360 --> 00:02:57,079
I by myself

48
00:02:57,079 --> 00:02:58,560
did the work for ten of them.

49
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,960
Then they sent me out to

50
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:01,960
hand out leaflets.

51
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,680
I really

52
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,080
couldn't do anything well.

53
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:09,920
It's probably

54
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,800
because you're too good.

55
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,600
And they were jealous.

56
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,120
You're probably the same.

57
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,840
You sure know how to talk.

58
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:22,400
Anyway,

59
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,960
I don't have any friends in Shanghai.

60
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,280
If you don't mind,

61
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:26,720
I'll be your first friend.

62
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:28,600
I'll stick to you from now on.

In my opinion,

67

you're not outdated.

177
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,520
tie your shoes.

178
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,560
You take this.

179
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:43,080
I help you tie.

180
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,840
If I hadn't worn the wrong shoes,

181
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,040
I could've been five hundred meters faster than you.

182
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:00,440
Since you're so good, you should be in the sports institute.

Why did you learn the opera?

184
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:05,080
To be honest,

185
00:10:05,080 --> 00:10:06,800
I did apply for the sports institute.

186
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:10,640
But I also worn the wrong shoes.

187
00:10:12,440 --> 00:10:13,440
What did you wear?

188
00:10:14,280 --> 00:10:15,240
Shoes with shoelace.

Don't tell him I'm here.

196

I know you're here. Stop hiding.

200
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:23,680
You dropped your admission form.

201
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:26,520
I came to give it to you.

202
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:37,240
Put it on the table.

203
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:38,680
I don't want to see you.

I'll kill you!

Shuji, Shuji, where did you go?

210
00:12:13,840 --> 00:12:16,160
He's weird

Do you have Wifi here?

We've been using our neighbour's.

214
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:38,240
What's the password?

215
00:12:38,640 --> 00:12:39,800
How do I know?

216
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:40,640
Go ask yourself.

217
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,560
I have a very important thing tonight.

just give me

00:12:56,640 --> 00:12:58,120
a Bai Feili revenge hotline?

225
00:12:58,640 --> 00:13:00,080
I'll book an appointment in advance.

226
00:13:03,280 --> 00:13:04,280
That's separate things.

227
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:06,360
It was me

228
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:07,720
who found your admission form.

229
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,800
It was also me who gave it back to you.

230
00:13:10,200 --> 00:13:11,240
Let me out

231
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:12,600
as a favor.

232
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:15,600
Do you think I want to

233
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:16,640
be locked with

I'll throw up in any minute staying here.

236
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,240
Throw up?

237
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,120
Well,

238
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:37,000
can you make a drink for me?

239
00:13:42,280 --> 00:13:43,840
A rich kid like you

240
00:13:43,960 --> 00:13:45,520
don't know how to do it on your own.

241
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,200
You're good at ordering people to do it for you.

242
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:53,320
I'll pay.

243
00:14:00,960 --> 00:14:01,720
Right.

244
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,720
You'll feel assured when you pay.

245
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:06,280
When you pay,

246
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:08,080
you can easily

247
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:09,880
abandon others after using them.

248
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:12,320
Leaving yourself well alone,

249
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:13,200
right?

250
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,000
Who's abandoning who?

251
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:17,840
Who didn't open the car door?

252
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:29,040
Aren't there any transoms?

253
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:30,400
How did they pass the fire check?

254
00:14:35,080 --> 00:14:36,640
Are we stuck here tonight?

255
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,040
You can get out from there.

256
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:53,440
How?

257
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,400
You say

258
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:55,560
and I'll do it.

259
00:14:57,520 --> 00:14:59,000
I'm not in a hurry to get out.

260
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,280
Didn't you just say

261
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,320
you'll throw up staying here for just one second?

262
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,000
Are you having Stockholm syndrome?

263
00:15:19,600 --> 00:15:21,000
Move away the books.

264
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:22,200
There's a door.

265
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:38,520
When a toothpick

266
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:39,520
got burnt by the fire

267
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,240
and sent to the hospital,

268
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,600
do you know what it becomes?

269
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:42,880
Guess.

270
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:44,880
Don't know?

271
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,120
Guess.

272
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:46,840
What does it become?

273
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:48,600
A cotton stick!

274
00:15:49,080 --> 00:15:49,960
So hilarious!

275
00:15:49,960 --> 00:15:51,080
Mr. Chen, is it funny?

276
00:15:51,760 --> 00:15:53,360
Is it hilarious?

277
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:54,280
Funny?

278
00:15:56,880 --> 00:15:57,960
It's about time now.

279
00:15:58,960 --> 00:15:59,520
Then.

280
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:02,120
Don't hurry.

281
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:03,800
Let's wait for some time.

282
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
Would you like to listen to

283
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,120
the demo of Jiubai?

284
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:08,920
Maybe there's a genre that you like.

285
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:10,200
No need.

286
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,320
You can send it to Xiao Zhou.

287
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:12,720
No need to hurry.

288
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:14,360
I've already made it.

289
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:15,360
Shall I

290
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:16,640
play it for you?

291
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:18,720
The song is a bit long.

292
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:20,360
I'll get you some desserts.

293
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,000
We can chat while listening.

294
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:23,040
How about

295
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:25,280
listening to it first?

296
00:16:27,400 --> 00:16:29,200
Take your time.

297
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:40,160
I'm sorry. The number you have dialed

298
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:43,080
is not available. Please...

299
00:16:42,820 --> 00:16:45,920
[Guanshan]

300
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,880
I'm sorry. The number you have dialed

is not available. Please...

302

I'm sorry, Jiajun.

303
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,839
He might ran into an emergency

304
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:09,760
so he couldn't make it today.

305
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:11,359
I'm really sorry.

306
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:12,079
You don't need to

307
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:14,599
be too formal between you and me.

308
00:17:14,960 --> 00:17:16,480
It's not being formal.

309
00:17:16,599 --> 00:17:18,839
My partner promised me earlier.

310
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:19,640
I don't know

311
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,240
why I suddenly couldn't contact him.

312
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:22,480
So

313
00:17:22,599 --> 00:17:23,480
I'm really sorry

314
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:25,440
to embarrass you in front of the boss.

315
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,680
If you have time,

316
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:30,000
I treat you a drink.

317
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,160
I still got things to do.

318
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,800
The car's here.

319
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:36,560
Junior,

320
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,680
back in university,

321
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:40,280
you won't do revision

322
00:17:40,280 --> 00:17:41,800
until one hour before the exam.

323
00:17:42,200 --> 00:17:43,400
That's because a straight-A student helped me.

324
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:44,240
How can I be worried?

325
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,360
That's true.

326
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:46,400
Back then

327
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:47,840
I valued you,

328
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:50,360
so I invested in you.

329
00:17:50,560 --> 00:17:51,680
Now

330
00:17:51,680 --> 00:17:53,160
I rely on Director Zhou

331
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:54,600
to watch our back.

332
00:17:54,800 --> 00:17:56,000
Stop it.

333
00:17:56,120 --> 00:17:57,360
You can rely on yourself.

334
00:17:57,760 --> 00:17:59,040
A straight-A student in Tsinghua University.

335
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,240
An outstanding graduate.

336
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,560
If you weren't working for the studio

337
00:18:01,560 --> 00:18:03,280
where the boss doesn't even show up,

338
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:04,680
you would have become a director sooner or later.

339
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:07,920
Mind your tone.

340
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:09,680
I'm your senior at school

341
00:18:09,840 --> 00:18:11,960
so I'm your senior for life.

342
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,760
Yes.

343
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:15,920
But we're at this age.

344
00:18:15,920 --> 00:18:17,560
Those who talk about the past

345
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,040
are often not doing well at present.

346
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:21,320
I think

347
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,200
people

348
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,400
should have a dream.

349
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,400
Compared with dreaming about

350
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,040
winning a lottery,

351
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:27,680
I would rather seize the moment now.

352
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:28,560
After all,

353
00:18:28,560 --> 00:18:30,000
dreams can't support you financially.

354
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,200
Senior,

355
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,480
you're almost thirty.

356
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:34,920
Take a look at your bank account.

357
00:18:36,240 --> 00:18:37,280
Don't remind me of my age.

358
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:38,400
Goodbye.

359
00:18:55,920 --> 00:18:57,760
Postpartum care of Hamster.

360
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:03,360
A hundred ways to beg for forgiveness.

361
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:05,880
What is actually forgiving?

362
00:19:06,320 --> 00:19:07,920
What are they selling here?

363
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:11,320
Not your bus...

364
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,520
business

365
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:15,960
I know.

366
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,120
I pronounce like that

367
00:19:18,560 --> 00:19:19,760
so I can memorize

368
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:20,960
the spelling better.

369
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,320
Which month is the exam?

370
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:24,040
You're just on B now.

371
00:19:26,240 --> 00:19:28,040
Not your business.

372
00:19:28,560 --> 00:19:29,320
How to spell it?

373
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,200
Why should I tell you?

374
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:38,160
Move.

375
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:47,400
Are you coming?

376
00:19:56,800 --> 00:19:58,400
There's a storage room.

377
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:00,280
Not a storage room.

378
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:02,720
The owner of the house was afraid of dying

379
00:20:02,720 --> 00:20:04,680
so he built an emergency room.

380
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:07,040
There's food, drinks and a bed.

381
00:20:07,040 --> 00:20:08,840
The supply is sufficient.

382
00:20:09,880 --> 00:20:12,360
Master, I caught the person who pulled off the switch.

383
00:20:12,760 --> 00:20:13,920
So stupid.

384
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:15,440
Don't run.

385
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:23,920
The suit.

386
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,880
I didn't expect you still kept the suit.

387
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:32,320
I didn't want to keep it.

388
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:33,400
Take it.

389
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:38,160
Why didn't you

390
00:20:38,160 --> 00:20:40,160
tell me your real name before?

391
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,080
Does it matter?

392
00:20:44,040 --> 00:20:44,920
Anyway,

393
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:46,960
it's enough for you

394
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,840
to know me as Liu Xichan.

395
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:51,840
Yu Fei,

396
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,640
I'm sorry.

397
00:20:56,960 --> 00:20:58,240
I can understand

398
00:20:58,800 --> 00:20:59,880
how you feel.

399
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:04,880
What feeling?

400
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:07,320
Being betrayed,

401
00:21:07,960 --> 00:21:09,080
leaving the other in danger

402
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,880
or not seeing your mother for the last time?

403
00:21:14,920 --> 00:21:15,920
I can understand all.

404
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:19,280
Whatever.

405
00:21:20,280 --> 00:21:21,160
It's like

406
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:23,400
what's told in the South Song.

407
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,360
I accept your apology.

408
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:27,280
Can you stop

409
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:29,160
following me from today?

410
00:21:29,440 --> 00:21:31,600
We owe nothing to each other anymore.

411
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:36,360
But

412
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:38,320
I still have your bracelet.

413
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:41,440
The bracelet

414
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,240
must matter a lot to you.

415
00:21:44,040 --> 00:21:46,240
The language of sweet olive is companionship.

416
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:48,800
It must be from someone who loves you very much.

417
00:21:56,280 --> 00:21:57,600
Are you getting out or not?

418
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,080
We can get out from the window.

419
00:22:01,680 --> 00:22:02,560
I'll go if you don't.

420
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:03,520
Wait.

421
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:04,400
What?

422
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,680
If I let you go first,

423
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:09,240
I won't get out.

424
00:22:09,800 --> 00:22:11,800
All right, you first.

425
00:22:15,080 --> 00:22:16,120
Be careful.

426
00:22:20,840 --> 00:22:21,880
Where's the lock?

427
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:24,360
Can I open it?

428
00:22:24,920 --> 00:22:28,520
Yes, I got out last time.

429
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:34,560
Did you find it?

430
00:22:35,480 --> 00:22:37,080
The window can't be open.

431
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:38,480
Goodbye!

432
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:40,560
Yu Fei.

433
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:42,960
Yu Fei.

434
00:22:44,640 --> 00:22:46,200
Yu Fei, it's not funny.

435
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:47,440
Get me out of here.

436
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:49,120
Bye.

437
00:22:49,520 --> 00:22:50,640
Only through this way

438
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:53,080
can you understand how I felt.

439
00:22:53,080 --> 00:22:54,040
Yu Fei.

440
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,880
She ran away again!

441
00:23:11,210 --> 00:23:13,180
[Jiubai]

442
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,760
Thank you taking Cang to the hospital.

443
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:20,360
What did the doctor say?

444
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,800
I know you're mad.

445
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:29,800
Don't you think you owe me an explanation?

446
00:23:30,280 --> 00:23:32,200
Were you kidnapped by an alien?

447
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:35,800
I wasn't kidnapped by an alien

448
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,160
but it's pretty much the same.

449
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,920
The alien let you go so quickly.

450
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:43,000
It's my fault.

451
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:44,920
About the Dragon Scale,

452
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,480
I'll figure out a way.

453
00:23:51,340 --> 00:23:54,010
[Dream of the South script]

454
00:23:51,640 --> 00:23:53,360
Is this your way?

455
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:57,840
I've already came up a name for the sequence of the South Song.

456
00:23:58,560 --> 00:23:59,680
Dream of the South Song.

457
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,040
As long as we

458
00:24:03,040 --> 00:24:04,240
stick through the beginning period,

459
00:24:04,720 --> 00:24:06,320
our achievements

460
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:07,560
and profits

461
00:24:08,160 --> 00:24:10,200
will be much more than the Dragon Scale.

462
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:11,800
Then everyone

463
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,040
won't need to

464
00:24:14,040 --> 00:24:16,080
add those stupid commercials.

465
00:24:16,280 --> 00:24:18,400
You can create something more meaningful.

466
00:24:18,560 --> 00:24:21,080
If you don't even want to act in the South Song,

467
00:24:21,080 --> 00:24:23,080
how can you start the sequence?

468
00:24:23,480 --> 00:24:26,040
What's the point of announcing it randomly?

469
00:24:28,160 --> 00:24:30,040
I took Cang to the hospital today.

470
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:31,880
The doctor said

471
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,600
it's not good.

472
00:24:34,440 --> 00:24:36,440
It may not live till next year.

473
00:24:38,800 --> 00:24:39,560
I understand.

474
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:41,880
I'll take it home to take care.

475
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:43,400
It's not the point.

476
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:45,440
Do you remember you said

477
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,560
the lifespan of a hamster is just a few years?

478
00:24:48,760 --> 00:24:51,480
It's similar to the lifespan of most Chinoiserie play.

479
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,920
This is our third hamster.

480
00:24:55,080 --> 00:24:56,680
How much time

481
00:24:56,680 --> 00:24:57,880
we left?

482
00:24:58,000 --> 00:24:59,400
Is everyone able to see the success of

483
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,720
Dream of the South Song?

484
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:01,920
I said that

485
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:05,160
I'll let Jiubai make it through.

486
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:11,440
We don't have any projects at the moment.

487
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,000
Don't you know how's everyone going through?

488
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:15,160
The Dragon Scale

489
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,880
is our last straw now.

490
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,040
If you don't accept it,

491
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:20,720
the Suzhou Comic Con

492
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,720
will be the last place to see Jiubai.

493
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:26,880
I understand what you said,

494
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:29,240
but I have my consideration.

495
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:33,120
You'd better think about it.

496
00:25:44,760 --> 00:25:46,000
Why isn't Shuji back yet?

497
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:49,640
I have to do all these exhausting work.

498
00:25:50,560 --> 00:25:52,560
I'm like a free labour.

499
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,640
What are you doing?

500
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,120
It's rare to see you working so hard.

501
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:06,120
Send it to aunt

502
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:07,040
to record it.

503
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:08,080
I'm doomed.

504
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:10,440
A group project is due tomorrow.

505
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:12,320
I still have a few pages left in the Powerpoint.

506
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:14,240
Isn't it a group project?

507
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:15,920
Where are the others?

508
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,680
When I go to Jiubai,

509
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,360
they always help me to sign in.

510
00:26:20,960 --> 00:26:23,400
That's what friends are for.

511
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:26,840
What is Bai Feili

512
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:29,240
up to with you all day?

513
00:26:29,840 --> 00:26:30,760
Yesterday

514
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,400
I let him go too easy.

515
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,480
You were with our boss yesterday?

516
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:36,040
I locked him up at the back.

517
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,400
If it weren't Shuji who came back yesterday,

518
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,360
he would have been still locked up there.

519
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,040
It was you!

520
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:45,160
What happened?

521
00:26:46,040 --> 00:26:48,560
I think you are wrong this time.

522
00:26:48,880 --> 00:26:51,040
Guanjiu finally persuaded him

523
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,040
and arranged an important meeting last night

524
00:26:53,040 --> 00:26:54,440
to discuss about the project.

525
00:26:55,320 --> 00:26:56,920
How could you lock him up?

526
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,480
But now,

527
00:26:58,920 --> 00:27:00,720
the project is doomed.

528
00:27:01,080 --> 00:27:02,560
I think the studio

529
00:27:02,560 --> 00:27:04,640
hardly can make ends meet.

530
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:08,400
Hao Shi,

531
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:09,960
you're talking about the boss

532
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,240
and Guanjiu.

533
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:12,560
Which side are you on?

534
00:27:13,360 --> 00:27:14,200
Traitor.

535
00:27:14,920 --> 00:27:16,440
Who's the traitor?

536
00:27:16,800 --> 00:27:18,920
They kept asking me about you.

537
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,960
I said you were at the Shandengting troupe

538
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:22,120
to cover you.

539
00:27:22,400 --> 00:27:23,760
If I had known you went this far,

540
00:27:23,960 --> 00:27:25,080
I wouldn't have helped you.

541
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:27,760
Welcome!

542
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:32,080
Isn't it Hao Shi?

543
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,880
You have time to hit on girls.

544
00:27:35,200 --> 00:27:36,800
Have you finished the group project?

545
00:27:36,960 --> 00:27:39,160
You always turn it in last.

546
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:41,440
I turn it in last

547
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,640
because I've been

548
00:27:42,800 --> 00:27:45,000
doing the homework for three people.

549
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:46,440
All right. Enough.

550
00:27:46,440 --> 00:27:47,600
Hurry and finish it.

551
00:27:48,560 --> 00:27:51,040
Excuse me.

552
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:54,040
Can I have boba milk tea? Less sugar and no ice.

553
00:27:54,880 --> 00:27:56,200
Two cups, please.

554
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:57,400
He'll pay.

555
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:00,000
Hurry up

556
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,960
or else we'll

557
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:05,360
get rid of all your strange clothes.

558
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:06,960
Let's go.

559
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:08,320
Go.

560
00:28:11,520 --> 00:28:12,760
Well,

561
00:28:12,760 --> 00:28:14,240
the cost can be taken

562
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:16,680
from what my mom gave me.

563
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:24,440
Get back.

564
00:28:24,440 --> 00:28:25,280
Get back. Get back.

565
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,480
Third position.

566
00:28:26,800 --> 00:28:28,400
Third position. Third position.

567
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:40,040
You're willing to make friends with Hao Shi.

568
00:28:40,240 --> 00:28:41,800
As her sister,

569
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:43,160
I'm very glad.

570
00:28:45,080 --> 00:28:46,760
Hao Shi

571
00:28:46,760 --> 00:28:49,000
used to be bullied a lot.

572
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,160
When he was ten,

573
00:28:50,160 --> 00:28:51,920
a classmate took away his snacks.

574
00:28:51,920 --> 00:28:53,200
How's that acceptable?

575
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,600
His snacks belong to me.

576
00:28:55,600 --> 00:28:56,840
I went after him.

577
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,040
When he was seventeen,

578
00:29:00,040 --> 00:29:02,480
because he's good at studying,

579
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:04,360
a classmate asked him to do his homework.

580
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:05,840
How can he have the time?

581
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:07,480
He needs to do mine.

582
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:10,840
Yes.

583
00:29:11,280 --> 00:29:13,680
We run our business with sincerity.

584
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:14,960
Have a taste.

585
00:29:21,640 --> 00:29:23,160
Thank you.

586
00:29:24,320 --> 00:29:25,320
How is it?

587
00:29:26,440 --> 00:29:27,200
Spicy.

588
00:29:27,400 --> 00:29:28,000
What?

589
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,800
Spicy? It's not good. I'll remake one.

590
00:29:29,800 --> 00:29:31,880
It's good. Really good.

591
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:33,320
Okay.

592
00:29:33,480 --> 00:29:36,400
You better take care of Hao Shi.

593
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,120
Let's go.

594
00:29:40,280 --> 00:29:42,240
Thank you. Thank you.

595
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:43,520
Goodbye.

596
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,920
Brats.

597
00:29:57,760 --> 00:30:00,240
Zhuang Sheng, come here.

598
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:04,320
You see.

599
00:30:05,040 --> 00:30:06,320
I think we can add

600
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,520
Wang Super Spicy Dandan Noodles.

601
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:11,440
Please give me power.

602
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:14,680
All right. Stop. Stop.

603
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:16,400
Your weak call

604
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:19,720
can be spread to Africa.

605
00:30:20,040 --> 00:30:21,520
You're not weak?

606
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:23,360
You try.

607
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:25,480
Yes. You try.

608
00:30:31,320 --> 00:30:32,280
Everyone,

609
00:30:33,080 --> 00:30:34,880
we can put the commercial aside.

610
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:36,480
We can start preparing the sequence of South Song,

611
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,600
Dream of the South Song.

612
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:39,360
As for the Dragon Scale,

613
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:40,520
we can pause it.

614
00:30:42,680 --> 00:30:44,600
Guanshan thinks that

615
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,800
the Dragon Scale is too commercialized,

616
00:30:45,800 --> 00:30:47,080
so we'll suspend it.

617
00:30:53,760 --> 00:30:55,280
Right?

618
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:08,680
Everyone has been busy overtime lately.

619
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:09,960
Gui Deng,

620
00:31:10,280 --> 00:31:11,880
ask what everyone wants to eat.

621
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,920
My goodness.

622
00:31:18,920 --> 00:31:20,120
It seems

623
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:22,440
my nachos trio

624
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,000
is for nothing.

625
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:26,240
I must not stop

626
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:27,640
losing weight this month.

627
00:31:28,040 --> 00:31:29,600
I knew it.

628
00:31:30,360 --> 00:31:32,040
Our boss has never been fond of

629
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,720
doing the commercial type.

630
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,920
I thought after the Dragon Scale,

631
00:31:37,280 --> 00:31:38,120
I would have money

632
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,560
to pay for my rent for the year.

633
00:31:41,680 --> 00:31:42,840
Zhuang Sheng,

634
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:45,280
help me move this home.

635
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,560
When the landlord comes for me tomorrow,

636
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:50,160
my family

637
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:52,000
will hide inside.

638
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:54,480
It's big enough.

639
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:56,120
But,

640
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:58,160
if we end the Dragon Scale,

641
00:31:58,160 --> 00:32:00,360
what's the point of Jiuye's hard work?

642
00:32:01,600 --> 00:32:02,880
It's ended.

643
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:09,320
I forgot my phone.

644
00:32:19,240 --> 00:32:20,800
If you want to treat everyone,

645
00:32:20,800 --> 00:32:22,440
you can order sushi

646
00:32:22,440 --> 00:32:24,760
from the opposite building.

647
00:32:55,880 --> 00:32:57,240
This is the third call

648
00:32:57,240 --> 00:32:59,080
from your busy schedule.

649
00:33:00,120 --> 00:33:02,200
It's special today.

650
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:04,720
I've called three times.

651
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:06,240
And you still couldn't think of it?

652
00:33:07,240 --> 00:33:08,280
Um,

653
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:10,120
the one washing dishes, hurry!

654
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,440
Clean up table eight after washing.

655
00:33:12,440 --> 00:33:14,280
The guests are almost coming in.

656
00:33:14,280 --> 00:33:15,880
Got it. Hurry.

657
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:17,200
Got it.

658
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:20,320
I'm busy. What are you doing?

659
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:21,920
Why are you washing the dishes again?

660
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:22,960
Aren't your fingers

661
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,480
able to sing opera too?

662
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:25,560
Quit your job.

663
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:26,760
I can support you.

664
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:27,720
Don't injure your hands.

665
00:33:27,720 --> 00:33:29,000
It's a piece of art.

666
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:32,440
I need to pay for my rent and exams.

667
00:33:32,440 --> 00:33:33,880
I need to pay off debt.

668
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,880
I'm content to have a job.

669
00:33:38,680 --> 00:33:40,360
I learned a new skill.

670
00:33:40,520 --> 00:33:42,520
I'll show you when you come.

671
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:45,040
Okay.

672
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:48,120
I'll go to your place after work.

673
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,400
Why are you on the phone during work？

674
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:58,640
You can only call our guests.

675
00:34:00,360 --> 00:34:02,120
How many guest did you serve tonight?

676
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:03,880
Do you have one?

677
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,800
How many bottles of wine did you sell?

678
00:34:06,480 --> 00:34:08,320
Don't forget about your KPI.

679
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:10,639
Those who are at the bottom will be eliminated.

680
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,320
Keep working.

681
00:34:16,199 --> 00:34:17,280
What are you waiting for?

682
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,560
Get on the phone.

683
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:21,199
Yes sir.

684
00:34:33,840 --> 00:34:36,120
Wei Sir, I'm so sorry.

685
00:34:36,120 --> 00:34:37,199
Your room

686
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,159
was booked by other guests.

687
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,159
Could you change to another one?

688
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:43,199
If not,

689
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,600
I'll send you a fruit platter.

690
00:34:45,600 --> 00:34:47,199
Or two platters.

691
00:34:49,000 --> 00:34:51,360
Mr. Wei will give them ten bottles of brandy

692
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:52,719
and ask them to leave immediately.

693
00:34:57,000 --> 00:34:58,200
Manager,

694
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:01,040
I can arrange it right now.

695
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,400
Wei Sir,

696
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:03,400
please give me a chance.

697
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,120
I'll make it happen.

698
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,640
Cheers! Cheers!

699
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:26,120
It's eye-opening.

700
00:35:36,080 --> 00:35:37,440
It's really

701
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,320
a new experience.

702
00:35:40,960 --> 00:35:41,840
Mr. Wei, Mr. Wei.

703
00:35:42,360 --> 00:35:43,960
It's Mr. Tian's

704
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:45,320
videocall.

705
00:35:47,720 --> 00:35:50,360
What to do? What to do?

706
00:35:50,360 --> 00:35:51,600
He thought I was abroad.

707
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:53,000
If he knew I was out here

708
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,000
drinking,

709
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:55,480
he would cut off my living expenses.

710
00:35:55,480 --> 00:35:56,000
What should I do?

711
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,040
Don't worry. Don't worry.

712
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,040
Wei Sir,

713
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,520
I've been making a living

714
00:36:00,880 --> 00:36:02,400
based on three things.

715
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:14,760
Formal meeting.

716
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,760
Gymroom.

717
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:21,480
Library.

718
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:25,560
Which one should I choose?

719
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:28,320
Hi daddy. I visited

720
00:36:28,320 --> 00:36:29,520
the financial street today

721
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,640
and then went to the library

722
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,080
to work on my thesis paper.

723
00:36:32,080 --> 00:36:34,320
I'm now running.

724
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:35,920
Right,

725
00:36:35,920 --> 00:36:37,320
I won't go back this holiday.

726
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:38,840
I need to do an internship at the financial street

727
00:36:38,840 --> 00:36:40,600
so I can help you out when I come back.

728
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:42,720
If you are staying abroad

729
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:44,320
just to drink and have fun,

730
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:46,120
I will go after you.

731
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:47,440
Well, daddy. I'll get back to running.

732
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,960
Talk to you later daddy.

733
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:50,600
Goodbye daddy.

734
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:54,160
Wei Sir. Wei Sir.

735
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,520
No need to bow down.

736
00:36:56,720 --> 00:36:58,240
I'm not bowing.

737
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:00,400
I haven't ran for a while. My legs are sore.

738
00:37:04,120 --> 00:37:05,000
Brother,

739
00:37:06,600 --> 00:37:08,560
among all the friends I know,

740
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:10,920
you're the best sales.

741
00:37:11,560 --> 00:37:13,520
I managed to keep my living expense

742
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,000
mostly because of you.

743
00:37:16,560 --> 00:37:17,760
Open a box of booze.

744
00:37:27,800 --> 00:37:29,240
Come on. Come on.

745
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,720
Come on. What's the matter?

746
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:32,520
Cheers. Cheers.

747
00:37:32,920 --> 00:37:33,720
Cheers, Wei Sir.

748
00:37:33,720 --> 00:37:35,800
Pour. Pour.

749
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:39,320
Wei Sir.

750
00:37:39,320 --> 00:37:41,120
Are you okay? Wei Sir.

751
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:42,520
Who

752
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,120
pushed Wei Sir?

753
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:51,000
Let's go.

754
00:37:51,600 --> 00:37:53,000
Who turned off the lights?

755
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:54,640
Who did that?

756
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,000
I'd like to pay.

757
00:38:12,960 --> 00:38:15,240
Would you like a set of seafood sushi?

758
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:16,600
Twenty percent off for two.

759
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,880
Isn't it twenty percent at eight?

760
00:38:19,880 --> 00:38:21,680
Our discount

761
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,320
only applies to two items.

762
00:38:23,320 --> 00:38:24,960
Would you like to have another one?

763
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,800
It's thirty-eight after the discount.

764
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:27,960
No need.

765
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:31,240
I can't have

766
00:38:31,240 --> 00:38:33,160
two boxes of sushi.

767
00:38:33,520 --> 00:38:36,000
Can you just sell me this box alone?

768
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:38,480
It can't be counted into the system.

769
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:40,760
I'm not the store manager.

770
00:38:40,760 --> 00:38:42,640
I don't have the rights.

771
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:45,640
I can't finish two boxes.

772
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,920
Or

773
00:38:48,080 --> 00:38:49,640
you can combine this with her.

774
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:51,280
No need.

775
00:38:51,280 --> 00:38:52,640
I don't know him.

776
00:38:52,760 --> 00:38:55,040
I'll pay full price.

777
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:57,840
I paid. Thank you.

778
00:39:08,080 --> 00:39:09,560
Forty. Keep the change.

779
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:12,080
Would you like the receipt? Sir.

780
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:13,640
No need. Thank you.

781
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:22,280
You forgot the sushi.

782
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:24,480
On my treat.

783
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,000
To make up the time yesterday.

784
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:31,880
The time lost

785
00:39:34,320 --> 00:39:35,520
needs to be paid back by time.

786
00:39:38,440 --> 00:39:40,320
Stay here with me to eat.

787
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:58,920
Thank you.

788
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,080
I'm allergic to eel.

789
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:08,920
I'll use a piece of eel to change for your cucumber.

790
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,040
It's my first time having eel.

791
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:22,480
I better taste it carefully.

792
00:40:27,800 --> 00:40:29,280
It's delicious.

793
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,040
For people like you who can't even separate chopsticks,

794
00:40:38,240 --> 00:40:40,240
you should usually eat at restaurants

795
00:40:40,760 --> 00:40:42,080
where they play symphony

796
00:40:42,080 --> 00:40:44,000
and use fork and knives.

797
00:40:46,200 --> 00:40:48,000
I'm just an office worker.

798
00:40:48,480 --> 00:40:49,680
Can you alter

799
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,720
your biases?

800
00:40:50,920 --> 00:40:52,400
I'm sorry. I can't.

801
00:40:56,160 --> 00:40:57,520
If you're really sorry,

802
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,600
have more eel sushi.

803
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:03,240
I'm not that sorry.

804
00:41:05,800 --> 00:41:07,520
You're honest.

805
00:41:10,440 --> 00:41:11,640
I wanted to ask you.

806
00:41:12,200 --> 00:41:13,600
Am I the only one in the world

807
00:41:13,600 --> 00:41:15,560
who can play Liu Xichan?

808
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:18,240
You came to find me

809
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:19,200
again and again,

810
00:41:19,600 --> 00:41:21,200
sitting here

811
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:22,360
and dining with me.

812
00:41:23,000 --> 00:41:24,480
Not exactly.

813
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:26,520
But

814
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:29,800
I feel I need to

815
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:32,360
explain some things clearly.

816
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,040
So...

817
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:36,520
I'm sorry.

818
00:41:36,520 --> 00:41:37,960
It's okay. It's okay.

819
00:41:39,880 --> 00:41:40,800
Don't pick it up.

820
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,520
I'll buy a pack of tissue.

821
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,240
Wait for me.

822
00:41:50,720 --> 00:41:51,720
Don't go.

823
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:56,600
Da Ge, come here.

824
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:59,320
Do you think it'll work by caring for me?

825
00:42:07,040 --> 00:42:08,120
Coming.

826
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,360
I can't move it.

827
00:42:16,600 --> 00:42:17,840
Look at you.

828
00:42:18,360 --> 00:42:20,480
You've been staying up late

829
00:42:20,480 --> 00:42:21,880
for that lousy interest group.

830
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:23,440
Now you don't have any energy left.

831
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:25,280
What do you mean interest group?

832
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,000
It's a career I'm pursuing.

833
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:30,040
Coming to the store to eat expired bread.

834
00:42:30,200 --> 00:42:31,920
You'll throw them away anyway.

835
00:42:31,920 --> 00:42:34,240
I'm saving resource for the society.

836
00:42:35,040 --> 00:42:38,240
You're still young, not taking your health seriously.

837
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:41,000
But you need to think about future career.

838
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:42,840
Look at your company.

839
00:42:42,840 --> 00:42:44,200
It's closed for several months.

840
00:42:45,000 --> 00:42:46,600
That's true.

841
00:42:47,120 --> 00:42:49,120
We almost signed a big project.

842
00:42:49,480 --> 00:42:51,120
But our boss

843
00:42:51,120 --> 00:42:52,680
missed an important meeting.

844
00:42:52,680 --> 00:42:55,280
Now we don't know if it can work out.

845
00:42:57,520 --> 00:42:59,280
But I believe our boss,

846
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:01,200
and we can realize the goal.

847
00:43:01,800 --> 00:43:04,400
Boss. Boss. Start moving.

848
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:25,600
Yesterday

849
00:43:27,720 --> 00:43:29,480
Hao Shi told me everything.

850
00:43:30,720 --> 00:43:31,840
I'm sorry

851
00:43:32,240 --> 00:43:33,560
to interfere with your work.

852
00:43:34,920 --> 00:43:36,440
It's not your fault.

853
00:43:37,320 --> 00:43:38,760
It's my problem.

854
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:41,840
I always thought

855
00:43:43,680 --> 00:43:45,840
persisting one hundred percent

856
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:49,400
meant respecting their dream.

857
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:51,280
I never thought that

858
00:43:53,360 --> 00:43:54,960
they had difficulties

859
00:43:56,920 --> 00:43:58,520
in places I neglected.

860
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,240
Don't blame yourself.

861
00:44:05,160 --> 00:44:06,680
It's time

862
00:44:07,360 --> 00:44:08,720
for transformation.

863
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,680
It can't be a bad thing.
