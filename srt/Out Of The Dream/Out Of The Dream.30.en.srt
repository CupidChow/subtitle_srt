00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:53,050
♫ Canoe adrift on the sea ♫

680
00:36:53,680 --> 00:36:58,010
♫ Or wind across the forest ♫

681
00:36:58,760 --> 00:37:02,340
♫ Fury against kindness ♫

682
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:07,340
♫ Crowds are silent but also turbulent ♫

683
00:37:08,340 --> 00:37:11,690
♫ Time flies and life is transient ♫

684
00:37:12,520 --> 00:37:16,740
♫ We don't have much time to hesitate ♫

685
00:37:17,110 --> 00:37:21,250
♫ I won't let you go ♫

686
00:37:21,740 --> 00:37:25,550
♫ Like a beast breaking out of the cage ♫

Do you know what's your fault?
