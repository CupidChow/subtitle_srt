This is my house. Why would I escape?

00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,058
I think someone

28
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:28,220
wants to go back on their words
after taking advantage of me last night.

29
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,060
Mr. Si, we're all adults.

30
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:37,180
We won't get hung up
on this small mistake, right?

31
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:40,019
Is this a small mistake?

32
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,299
How about

33
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,220
I buy you a meal

34
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:49,340

35
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,139
No thanks.

36
00:02:53,180 --> 00:02:54,060
Mr. Si.

37
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:56,460
It's just a one night stand.

38
00:02:56,700 --> 00:02:59,299
You won't mind, will you?

39
00:03:01,059 --> 00:03:01,940
I don't mind.

40
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:04,139
Your skills last night were mediocre.

41
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:08,819
Okay.

42
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,620
I didn't have enough sleep.
Let me take a nap.

43
00:03:11,860 --> 00:03:12,419
Get out.

44
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,818
Xingxing and Baobei will be back soon.

45
00:03:13,819 --> 00:03:14,579
Leave.

46
00:03:15,619 --> 00:03:16,220
Leave.

47
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,979
My skills are bad?

48
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:50,460
We'll proceed
according to our plan later.

49
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,618
Stop, Ms. Mu Yunge.

50
00:03:53,619 --> 00:03:54,660
You are under arrest.

51
00:03:54,939 --> 00:03:55,778
From now on,

52
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:57,299
you have the right to remain silent,

53
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:58,658
but everything you say

54
00:03:58,659 --> 00:04:00,579
will be used as evidence in court.

55
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,460
What dramas
have you been watching recently?

56
00:04:02,619 --> 00:04:04,100
What lines are you reading?

57
00:04:08,140 --> 00:04:09,220
Have you had breakfast?

58
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,380
Mommy, hurry. Explain.

59
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:20,059
Officer, I'll confess.

60
00:04:20,659 --> 00:04:25,298
I accidentally
drank too much last night.

61
00:04:25,299 --> 00:04:26,739
You're still not honest.

62
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,140
I support you bringing Mr. Si home,

63
00:04:30,260 --> 00:04:33,178
but you must marry Mr. Si.

64
00:04:33,179 --> 00:04:34,778
I... No.

65
00:04:34,779 --> 00:04:36,579
Xingxing has found out

66
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,939
that it only costs nine yuan
to get a marriage certificate.

67
00:04:38,979 --> 00:04:40,179
I'll pay for it.

68
00:04:40,299 --> 00:04:42,218
Xingxing, give me money.

69
00:04:42,219 --> 00:04:43,739
Aren't you paying?

70
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:46,338
No, give me.

71
00:04:46,339 --> 00:04:47,499
Okay.

72
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:48,580
Here.

73
00:04:50,060 --> 00:04:51,340
Do you

74
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:55,379
really want Mr. Si to marry me?

75
00:05:00,020 --> 00:05:03,859
I'll think about it.
Let's see how he behaves.

76
00:05:27,179 --> 00:05:28,179
Have you settled everything?

77
00:05:28,580 --> 00:05:29,379
Yes.

78
00:05:29,380 --> 00:05:31,499
We've terminated
all cooperation with Mr. Liu.

79
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:36,739
Wait.

80
00:05:40,859 --> 00:05:42,260
Has Mu Yunge come to work?

81
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,140
Yes.

82
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:44,379
Why didn't I see her then?

83
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:45,699
I'll call her over.

84
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:46,340
No need.

85
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,100
You don't need to follow me.

86
00:06:44,979 --> 00:06:45,700
Stop.

87
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:49,340
What's the matter, Ms. Mu?

88
00:06:50,219 --> 00:06:51,800
Something's wrong
with the drinks last night.

89
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,059
Why did you set me up?

90
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:56,580
How did you find out
something's wrong with the drinks?

91
00:06:56,820 --> 00:06:58,780
You know whether you did it.

92
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,979
There's a price to pay
for slandering me.

93
00:07:03,260 --> 00:07:05,220
Please be more direct
if you want to target me.

94
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:08,580
Don't insult me ​
with such poor acting skills.

95
00:07:09,539 --> 00:07:11,020
Report to the police then.

96
00:07:11,219 --> 00:07:13,260
The police can prove my innocence.

97
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:14,619
Also,

98
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:18,179
this is my territory.

99
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:30,179
So what if it's your territory?

100
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:32,059
You can't just do bad things casually.

101
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,220
Stop!

102
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,260
Apologize.

103
00:07:40,859 --> 00:07:42,100
Me?

104
00:07:43,659 --> 00:07:44,419
Gu Xiao.

105
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:45,979
Apologize to Mu Yunge.

106
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:48,700
What do you mean?

107
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:52,340
I was just working last night.

108
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:53,539
I'm innocent.

109
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:55,640
You won't even distinguish
between right and wrong for her.

110
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,298
You even want me to apologize to her.

111
00:07:57,299 --> 00:07:58,299
Have you lost your mind?

112
00:07:58,500 --> 00:07:59,259
Gu Xiao.

113
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:01,100
Do I need to tell you
what you did last night?

114
00:08:02,500 --> 00:08:03,218
Mr. Si.

115
00:08:03,219 --> 00:08:06,299
Please take care
of your personal affairs.

116
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,460
I've got work to do.

117
00:08:10,260 --> 00:08:11,939
Control your fiancee.

118
00:08:19,380 --> 00:08:20,100
Gu Xiao.

119
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:22,379
I'll let this one go,

120
00:08:22,859 --> 00:08:25,299
but our friendship
of more than ten years is over.

121
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:27,379
If you hurt Mu Yunge again,

122
00:08:28,099 --> 00:08:29,619
I won't go easy on you.

123
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:31,499
Besides, I think you're well aware

124
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,859
of our relationship.

125
00:08:32,939 --> 00:08:34,139
I don't want to hear

126
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:35,820
any rumors about us.

127
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:38,540
