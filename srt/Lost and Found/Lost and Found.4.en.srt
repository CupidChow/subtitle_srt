Thank you.

has to perform a trick.

15
00:00:35,159 --> 00:00:37,419
A trick?

16
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:39,260
I'll give you an example.

17
00:00:39,679 --> 00:00:41,739
Here. Clear a path for me.

18
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,220

Okay. Good job.

Good job.

Come on.

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,379
Good job.

25
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,878
How pretty.

26
00:01:06,879 --> 00:01:08,019
Okay.

27
00:02:12,919 --> 00:02:13,779

31
00:02:52,479 --> 00:02:53,619
Let me introduce you.

32
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:56,140
This is Gu Xiao,
my friend for many years.

33
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:57,059
Hello.

34
00:02:57,319 --> 00:02:59,779
Gu Xiao, this is my wife, Ning Wuhui.

35
00:03:02,759 --> 00:03:04,339
Nice to meet you.

36
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,820
Ye.

37
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,140
I wish you happiness.

38
00:03:12,520 --> 00:03:15,359
Si Qingye
can't have any women around him.

39
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:16,799
Ning Wuhui must disappear.

40
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:17,959
Be stealthy.

41
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:19,219
Kill her.

42
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:25,580
(She's still alive.)

43
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,380
Hello, Ms. Gu.

44
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:35,899
Help me tell Mr. Lu

45
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,638
that we have news about Ning Wuhui.

46
00:03:37,639 --> 00:03:39,239
Where is she? Jiang City?

47
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:40,059
Yes.

48
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,459
She's in Jiang City.

49
00:03:48,479 --> 00:03:50,279
Didn't you think I'm Ning Wuhui

50
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:51,660
and want to kill me?

51
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,700
Why do you keep protecting me?

52
00:03:54,759 --> 00:03:56,779
You should distance yourself from me.

53
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,179
Once I find out your true identity,

54
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,339
I'll handle you myself.

55
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:03,540
But before this,

56
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:04,899
nothing can happen to you.

57
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:06,380
Not even get sick.

58
00:04:07,639 --> 00:04:09,260
How unreasonable.

59
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:13,679
Why don't you remember anything

60
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:14,820
from seven years ago?

61
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,819
Don't you want to find out the reason?

62
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:20,579
Maybe what happened before
was too painful.

63
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:22,239
I think life is pretty good now.

64
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,699
I have Xingxing and Baobei.

65
00:04:23,879 --> 00:04:25,540
I can start all over.

66
00:04:25,959 --> 00:04:27,900

and worked hard.

103
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,460

Mr. Si, my mommy is a workaholic.

121
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:59,318
She loves to work

122
00:07:59,319 --> 00:08:01,259
and never takes leave casually.

Mr. Si, you're early.

00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:28,259

nor did you reply on WeChat.

138
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,179
You look awful.

139
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:44,780
Did you not sleep well last night?

140
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:48,020
What do you want to see me about?

It's just that Mu Yunge,
the new designer at the company,

143
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,260
looks just like her.

144
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,300
