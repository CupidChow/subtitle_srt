=Episode 11=

3
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:17,950
Boss.

4
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,258
Why are we going to Thailand again?

5
00:00:19,259 --> 00:00:20,669
We haven't been there in years.

6
00:00:21,180 --> 00:00:21,859
I'm telling you.

7
00:00:21,860 --> 00:00:23,819
I don't want to go to Thailand.

8
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:25,059
I don't know what's going on.

9
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:27,029
I won't go there if it weren't for you.

10
00:00:30,220 --> 00:00:31,270
You don't want to go?

11
00:00:31,739 --> 00:00:32,949
Why are you dressed like that?

12
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:37,350
But Boss,

13
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:39,549
Weren't you

14
00:00:39,699 --> 00:00:41,739
reluctant to mention Thailand before?

15
00:00:41,740 --> 00:00:43,670
Why did you suddenly...

16
00:00:50,019 --> 00:00:51,390
The story should end

17
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:53,110
where it began.

18
00:00:54,100 --> 00:00:56,030
Maybe I'll find the answer

19
00:00:57,019 --> 00:00:58,670
after this trip.

20
00:01:03,699 --> 00:01:04,509
Let's go.

21
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,229
Ms. Gu, you wanted to see me?

22
00:01:38,779 --> 00:01:39,949
Did you make this?

23
00:01:41,699 --> 00:01:42,389
Yes.

24
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,309
Redo everything.

25
00:01:48,540 --> 00:01:50,430
This is the proposal
decided at the previous meeting.

26
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:51,618
What's wrong with it?

27
00:01:51,619 --> 00:01:54,509
Can't you redo it if there's no problem?

28
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,040
Are you making things difficult for me?

29
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:04,430
Gu Xiao.

30
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:06,058
Don't think I don't know

31
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:08,670
that you've stayed
by Si Qingye's side as a friend.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:11,218
You tried so hard,
yet you didn't get any attention.

33
00:02:11,219 --> 00:02:13,550
Now, you even
brought your emotions to work.

34
00:02:13,580 --> 00:02:15,058
Don't you think you're ridiculous?

35
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:15,990
Shut up.

36
00:02:18,179 --> 00:02:20,670
I advise you to put away
ideas you shouldn't have.

37
00:02:21,140 --> 00:02:23,830
Don't think I don't know
why you stay in this company.

38
00:02:24,619 --> 00:02:26,430
He stayed by your side

39
00:02:27,140 --> 00:02:30,589
only because you're a lookalike.

40
00:02:37,539 --> 00:02:38,749
Then what are you?

41
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,869
Ridiculous.

42
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:44,670
I'm getting off work

43
00:02:55,219 --> 00:02:56,869
It's raining.

44
00:03:16,020 --> 00:03:16,830
We meet again.

45
00:03:17,980 --> 00:03:18,589
You...

46
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:19,950
You...

47
00:03:20,339 --> 00:03:22,950
You're the Lotso from that day.

48
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,270
My name is Lu Siao.

49
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:25,749
Sorry for offending you last time.

50
00:03:26,460 --> 00:03:28,789
My gaming company was doing an event.

51
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,430
Were you experiencing life last time?

52
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,029
Did you come to MK to...

53
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,990
I'm doing business with them.

54
00:03:38,819 --> 00:03:39,909
Let me give you a ride.

55
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:41,430
No thanks.

56
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:46,510
Take it.

57
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,110
Thank you.

58
00:03:52,219 --> 00:03:52,909
Bye.

59
00:04:11,260 --> 00:04:12,430
(Wuhui.)

60
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:15,550
(I'll make sure
you get your memory back.)

61
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:23,589
The weather
alternates between rainy and sunny.

62
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,390
(Si Qingye.)

63
00:04:46,620 --> 00:04:48,390
(We haven't met in days.)

64
00:04:49,140 --> 00:04:51,390
(Did you really leave
without saying goodbye?)

65
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:54,349
(Are you trying to avoid me)

66
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,950
(or end this relationship?)

67
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,530
(Thailand)

68
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,310
Boss.

69
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,390
It's been seven years.

70
00:05:10,900 --> 00:05:12,710
You should figure out your feelings.

71
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:15,349
Do you love Ning Wuhui or Mu Yunge?

72
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:16,950
Cherish the present.

73
00:05:17,659 --> 00:05:19,029
You don't need to remind me.

74
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,789
I've figured it out
over the past few days.

75
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,139
That's good.

76
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:24,939
I think you're happy now.

77
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,619
Look.

78
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:28,349
You gained two cute kids for nothing.

79
00:05:28,859 --> 00:05:30,989
If I have those two kids,

80
00:05:31,060 --> 00:05:33,789
I would be very happy.

81
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:36,349
What do you mean?

82
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,510
Nothing. I'm feeling happy for you.

83
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:49,589
Seriously,

84
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:51,909
I miss her.

85
00:05:52,219 --> 00:05:53,270
Ms. Mu?

86
00:05:56,659 --> 00:05:58,710
Where are we
on the whereabouts of Sura's leader?

87
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,549
I'll check again.

88
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,510
Xingxing, Baobei

89
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:11,870
What are you doing?

90
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:14,178
I miss you.

91
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:16,098
Xingxing, it's Mr. Si.

92
00:06:16,099 --> 00:06:18,139
Mr. Si, we miss you too.

93
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,830
Hurry back.

94
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:26,459
Mr. Si, hurry back.

95
00:06:26,460 --> 00:06:27,658
Mommy misses you.

96
00:06:27,659 --> 00:06:29,310
We miss you too.

97
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,019
If you don't come back,

98
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:33,270
someone will steal Mommy.
