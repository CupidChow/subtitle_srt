00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,980
=Episode 2=

3
00:00:27,299 --> 00:00:28,320
Babies.

4
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:30,120
School's over. Are you almost home?

5
00:00:30,139 --> 00:00:30,699
Mommy.

6
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:32,879
We're on our way home.

7
00:00:59,259 --> 00:01:01,160
Baobei, did you forget the password...

8
00:01:03,579 --> 00:01:04,840
It's you.

9
00:01:08,979 --> 00:01:09,659
No.

10
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:11,058
This... This is my home.

11
00:01:11,059 --> 00:01:11,939
Why are you...

12
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,618
Would you cut it out?

13
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:15,719
I told you you had the wrong person.

14
00:01:21,059 --> 00:01:22,760
This... This is my water.

15
00:01:31,499 --> 00:01:32,480
Mr. Si.

16
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:35,200
Breaking and entering is illegal.

17
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,320
Do you want me
to call the police for you?

18
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:37,999
You...

19
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:44,659
My babies will be back soon.

20
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,920
I'm afraid they'll get the wrong idea.

21
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:46,840
Get out.

22
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,680
Are the kids mine?

23
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,919
Who has kids with you?

24
00:01:58,100 --> 00:01:59,320
I missed you everyday

25
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:02,680
for seven years.

26
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,960
Lunatic.

27
00:02:11,939 --> 00:02:12,919
Ning Wuhui.

28
00:02:13,420 --> 00:02:15,160
Seven years ago,

29
00:02:15,539 --> 00:02:17,239
you disappeared without a trace.

30
00:02:17,339 --> 00:02:19,160
I looked for you for seven years.

31
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,179
Have you forgotten

32
00:02:20,180 --> 00:02:21,218
our love

33
00:02:21,219 --> 00:02:22,320
and memories?

34
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:25,000
Now that I've finally found you,

35
00:02:25,059 --> 00:02:27,160
Shouldn't you explain to me?

36
00:02:27,939 --> 00:02:30,320
I don't know what you're talking about.

37
00:02:30,339 --> 00:02:31,419
And I'm not the Ning Wuhui

38
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,938
you're looking for.

39
00:02:32,939 --> 00:02:34,679
I'll soon find out

40
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:38,119
if you're Ning Wuhui.

41
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:39,560
I...

42
00:02:48,580 --> 00:02:49,639
Pervert.

43
00:02:52,219 --> 00:02:53,040
Where's your tattoo?

44
00:02:53,099 --> 00:02:54,019
Where's the tattoo?

45
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,019
What tattoo?

46
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,400
I'll call the police
if you do this again.

47
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,359
Who...

48
00:02:57,379 --> 00:02:58,058
Let me go.

49
00:02:58,059 --> 00:02:59,040
Call the police.

50
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:01,119
Baobei, don't look.

51
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,160
I want to look.

52
00:03:03,779 --> 00:03:06,440
Looks like
'm going to have a daddy soon.

53
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,098
Baobei, there's nothing going on.

54
00:03:10,099 --> 00:03:11,399
Sir.

55
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:14,639
Are you here to woo my mommy?

56
00:03:17,140 --> 00:03:17,919
Xingxing.

57
00:03:18,059 --> 00:03:19,119
Take Baobei upstairs.

58
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:21,778
Sir, how old are you?

59
00:03:21,779 --> 00:03:23,239
Do you need a girlfriend?

60
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,720
Mu Xingxing.

61
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:26,618
What do you think of my mommy?

62
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:29,440
She studied her master's overseas,
has a house but no car,

63
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:30,739
and is currently single.

64
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:32,459
Besides obsessing with short dramas,

65
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:34,280
she has no bad habits.

66
00:03:40,939 --> 00:03:41,839
Here. Come here.

67
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,239
Xingxing.

68
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:44,720
Gosh.

69
00:03:45,580 --> 00:03:47,079
You're so cute.

70
00:03:50,499 --> 00:03:51,480
Si Qingye.

71
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,699
Here's my passport.

72
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,899
Here's my ID card.

73
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,218
Take a good look.

74
00:03:56,219 --> 00:03:58,560
I'm not
the Ning Wuhui you're looking for.

75
00:03:59,059 --> 00:04:00,359
You're Ning Wuhui.

76
00:04:00,700 --> 00:04:01,880
I won't mistake you.

77
00:04:02,300 --> 00:04:03,419
I'm not.

78
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,139
You are.

79
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:04,739
I'm not.

80
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,459
You are.

81
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:06,658
I'm not.

82
00:04:06,659 --> 00:04:07,299
You are.

83
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,459
Mommy, calm down.

84
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:11,959
Arguing won't solve problems.

85
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,000
I think

86
00:04:14,059 --> 00:04:17,738
he's making a scene here because
he got scammed out of money and love

87
00:04:17,739 --> 00:04:19,360
and couldn't find the perpetrator.

88
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,000
May I ask

89
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:26,019
if you can go out now?

90
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:27,000
Sure.

91
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:29,920
We'll be seeing
a lot of each other anyway.

92
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,399
I live right next door.

93
00:04:31,460 --> 00:04:32,218
Mr. Si.

94
00:04:32,219 --> 00:04:34,360
Are you living here from now on?

95
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:35,519
Yeah.

96
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,978
That's great.

97
00:04:36,979 --> 00:04:39,178
Mr. Si is our neighbor now.

98
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:41,680
We can see each other every day.

99
00:04:42,979 --> 00:04:43,839
Don't worry.

100
00:04:44,179 --> 00:04:45,719
I'll come and see you more often.

101
00:04:55,659 --> 00:04:56,839
Farewell.

102
00:05:09,419 --> 00:05:10,719
How did it go? Did you get it?

103
00:05:12,179 --> 00:05:13,218
I'll put it in a bag for you.

104
00:05:13,219 --> 00:05:14,560
Send it for a paternity test.

105
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:18,519
Are you really going to live here?

106
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:21,200
And get me something that kids like.

107
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:27,260
(Mu Residence)

108
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,599
Mr. Si.

109
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:32,519
Why do you have time
to visit my humble abode today?

110
00:05:33,859 --> 00:05:34,939
I heard

111
00:05:34,940 --> 00:05:37,000
you're holding a banquet
for your granddaughter's return.

112
00:05:37,219 --> 00:05:38,699
I came to congratulate you

113
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,360
and find out

114
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,560
about
your granddaughter's experience abroad.

115
00:05:42,820 --> 00:05:45,320
Yunge had an accident

116
00:05:45,419 --> 00:05:47,579
(Mr. Mu, Head of The Mu Family)
and lost all her memory.

117
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,019
The past is in the past.

118
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,418
Stop asking about it.

119
00:05:50,419 --> 00:05:51,920
Cherish the present.

120
00:05:55,500 --> 00:05:56,360
Mr. Si.

121
00:05:56,700 --> 00:05:57,760
Later,

122
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,819
I'll introduce my granddaughter, Yunge,

123
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:01,279
to you.

124
00:06:01,339 --> 00:06:04,159
You young people
should communicate more.

125
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,880
Mr. Mu.

126
00:06:09,380 --> 00:06:10,959
I've known your granddaughter

127
00:06:11,299 --> 00:06:12,760
for a long time.

128
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:18,599
Okay.

129
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:19,338
Okay.

130
00:06:19,339 --> 00:06:21,639
It's good for young people
to keep up with the times.

131
00:06:21,859 --> 00:06:23,200
Okay. Keep up with the times.

132
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,240
I drank a little too much tea.

133
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,599
I need to go to the toilet.

134
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:29,839
Restroom?

135
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:31,639
There's one here.

136
00:06:31,659 --> 00:06:32,920
Here.

137
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:35,159
There's also one there.

138
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:36,379
Go.

139
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:38,240
Take Mr. Si to the toilet.

140
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:40,538
No thanks, Mr. Mu.

141
00:06:40,539 --> 00:06:41,538
I can find it myself.

142
00:06:41,539 --> 00:06:42,399
This way.

143
00:06:50,299 --> 00:06:52,519
Sir, it's almost time
for the banquet to start.

144
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,599
Okay.

145
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:55,560
Let's go.

146
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,159
Hello.

147
00:07:03,740 --> 00:07:04,379
Congratulations.

148
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:06,639
- Congratulations for Ms. Mu's returning.
- Congratulations, Mr. Mu.

149
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:07,538
Hello.

150
00:07:07,539 --> 00:07:08,459
You're healthy.

151
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,240
Yeah.

152
00:07:09,339 --> 00:07:10,178
Mr. Mu.

153
00:07:10,179 --> 00:07:11,159
Mr. Mu.

154
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:12,639
Hello.

155
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:14,279
I've invited you

156
00:07:14,779 --> 00:07:16,719
to my banquet today

157
00:07:16,779 --> 00:07:19,639
to announce two things.

158
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:22,639
What are they?

159
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:26,240
First,

160
00:07:27,419 --> 00:07:28,959
to celebrate my granddaughter,

161
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,959
Mu Yunge,

162
00:07:32,419 --> 00:07:35,440
for finally returning to the Mu family.

163
00:07:35,620 --> 00:07:36,399
Here.

164
00:07:36,460 --> 00:07:37,218
Congratulations.

165
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,459
Congratulations, Mr. Mu.

166
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,839
I see.

167
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:47,418
Yunge's parents died young.

168
00:07:47,419 --> 00:07:49,619
And she raised two children alone.

169
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,440
The past few years haven't been easy,

170
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:54,899
But Yunge is independent,
strong and responsible.

171
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:57,800
She carries the Mu family's good genes.

172
00:07:57,820 --> 00:07:59,440
Therefore, the second thing is

173
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:02,639
that I've decided to change my will.

174
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:09,719
Yunge will be
the heir to my entire fortune.

175
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,560
Really?

176
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:20,320
Grandpa.

177
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,719
Yunge, don't be shy.

178
00:08:23,820 --> 00:08:25,800
I've also decided

179
00:08:26,060 --> 00:08:27,619
to give Yunge

180
00:08:27,620 --> 00:08:31,599
this residence as a gift for her return.

181
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:38,938
(Madam Mu, The Mu Family's Daughter)
Dad, this is a big deal.

182
00:08:38,939 --> 00:08:40,979
Why didn't you discuss it with us?

183
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:42,320
Why should I discuss

184
00:08:43,020 --> 00:08:44,680
the inheritance of my fortune with you?

185
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,560
I...

186
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,800
(Mu Yaner, Granddaughter)
Grandad.

187
00:08:47,819 --> 00:08:49,239
I know you love Yunge,

188
00:08:49,380 --> 00:08:50,698
but this is too soon.

189
00:08:50,699 --> 00:08:51,800
Say no more.

190
00:08:51,939 --> 00:08:53,359
I've made my decision.

191
00:08:53,939 --> 00:08:57,139
I didn't ask for your opinion today.

192
00:08:57,140 --> 00:09:00,160
I'm just informing you.

193
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:01,818
Dad, you can't do this.

194
00:09:01,819 --> 00:09:02,800
All right.

195
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,538
Of course, Yunge

196
00:09:03,539 --> 00:09:06,040
won't get all this for free.

197
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:09,219
The condition is to join MK Company

198
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,879
and see your work performance.

199
00:09:10,939 --> 00:09:12,280
Yunge, good luck.

200
00:09:12,459 --> 00:09:13,438
- Here, Baobei
- Great Grandpa.

201
00:09:13,438 --> 00:09:14,538
- Great Grandpa.
- Greet Great Grandpa.

202
00:09:14,539 --> 00:09:15,099
Xingxing.

203
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:17,458
Yunge, entertain the guests. All right.

204
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:17,859
Okay.

205
00:09:17,860 --> 00:09:18,719
Let's go.

206
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,920
Go.

207
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,999
Dad.

208
00:09:30,740 --> 00:09:31,680
Mom.

209
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,320
Say something.

210
00:09:35,220 --> 00:09:36,280
Yunge.

211
00:09:37,059 --> 00:09:38,499
You didn't greet me

212
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,359
when you saw me.

213
00:09:41,699 --> 00:09:42,440
Auntie.

214
00:09:43,939 --> 00:09:44,658
Look.

215
00:09:44,659 --> 00:09:46,520
Since you consider me your aunt,

216
00:09:46,900 --> 00:09:48,680
you shouldn't take over
such a big family business

217
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:50,920
yourself.

218
00:09:52,419 --> 00:09:53,418
Yeah.

219
00:09:53,419 --> 00:09:54,959
How could you?

220
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:57,019
How dare you stab us in the back

221
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,719
and convince Grandad to change his will.

222
00:10:00,579 --> 00:10:02,599
I just found out about this too.

223
00:10:04,059 --> 00:10:06,359
I don't care
if you have a messy personal life,

224
00:10:06,740 --> 00:10:08,418
but you have two children

225
00:10:08,419 --> 00:10:09,698
out of wedlock.

226
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:11,578
You don't even know who their father is.

227
00:10:11,579 --> 00:10:14,280
Yet you brought them here
and showed them off today.

228
00:10:14,579 --> 00:10:16,479
Have you no shame?

229
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:18,359
You can criticize me.

230
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:20,599
Don't insult my children.

231
00:10:20,659 --> 00:10:22,239
So what if I criticize them?

232
00:10:22,340 --> 00:10:24,479
Are you going to hit me
in front of so many people?

233
00:10:25,980 --> 00:10:26,938
It's the first time

234
00:10:26,939 --> 00:10:28,479
I've ever heard such a request.

235
00:10:30,340 --> 00:10:31,458
How dare you slap me?

236
00:10:31,459 --> 00:10:32,739
If you say bad things again,

237
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:34,400
I'll slap you
for every bad thing you say.

238
00:10:34,699 --> 00:10:35,479
