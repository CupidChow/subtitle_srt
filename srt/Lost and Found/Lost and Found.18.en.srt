3
00:00:18,020 --> 00:00:19,029
Wuhui.

4
00:00:20,020 --> 00:00:21,590
I taught you

5
00:00:22,180 --> 00:00:23,389
every move you know.

6
00:00:23,459 --> 00:00:24,950
How are you going to defeat me?

7
00:00:32,379 --> 00:00:33,589
Don't kill him, okay?

8
00:00:36,979 --> 00:00:39,269
(I told you not to fall for him.)

9
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,869
(Remember.)

10
00:00:43,579 --> 00:00:45,829
(Your name is Ning Wuhui.)

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:48,869
(I'll help you)

12
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:51,549
(regain the memories you lost)

13
00:00:51,979 --> 00:00:53,790
(one by one.)

14
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,498
Mr. Si, I'm here!

15
00:01:56,499 --> 00:01:58,579
Mr. Si, I'm here!

16
00:01:58,580 --> 00:02:00,070
Mr. Si!

17
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,218
Mom, Xingxing's back!

18
00:02:03,219 --> 00:02:04,029
Mom.

19
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:06,109
Xingxing, are you okay? Xingxing.

20
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:06,990
Xingxing.

21
00:02:07,219 --> 00:02:09,230
Mom, Xingxing's back.

22
00:02:09,819 --> 00:02:10,589
Xingxing.

23
00:02:45,099 --> 00:02:46,029
You woke up.

24
00:02:48,659 --> 00:02:49,749
Lu Xiao.

25
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:52,670
Have you remembered everything?

26
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,110
Where am I?

27
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,069
Where did you hide Xingxing?

28
00:03:03,499 --> 00:03:04,430
Don't worry.

29
00:03:05,499 --> 00:03:06,550
Xingxing's

30
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,069
safe.

31
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:11,629
He has gone home.

32
00:03:13,460 --> 00:03:14,469
Besides,

33
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:19,349
I'm not interested in him.

34
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,189
It was my fault seven years ago.

35
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:31,589
I shouldn't have let you
approach Si Qingye.

36
00:03:37,659 --> 00:03:40,029
You've regained your memory.

37
00:03:48,539 --> 00:03:50,309
I missed you.

38
00:03:54,819 --> 00:03:56,469
Let me take you home.

39
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:01,469
Whatever you want to do,

40
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:02,909
stop.

41
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:07,390
No matter who I was before,

42
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:09,550
it's over.

43
00:04:10,460 --> 00:04:12,349
I'm only Mu Yunge now.

44
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,510
It doesn't matter.

45
00:04:16,299 --> 00:04:17,989
You just recovered your memory.

46
00:04:19,539 --> 00:04:21,589
Once I settled Si Qingye,

47
00:04:22,659 --> 00:04:24,070
I'll bring you home.

48
00:04:28,460 --> 00:04:29,789
I'll bring you

49
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,429
to somewhere sunny.

50
00:04:34,659 --> 00:04:36,669
Why don't I take you to Tuscany?

51
00:04:37,659 --> 00:04:40,510
It's the sunniest place in the world.

52
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,270
No.

53
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:46,150
I don't want to leave.

54
00:04:46,659 --> 00:04:48,469
I won't let you hurt Si Qingye.

55
00:04:48,739 --> 00:04:50,750
Si Qingye.

56
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:52,950
Why do you like him so much?

57
00:04:54,659 --> 00:04:56,710
He's just a part of your mission.

58
00:04:57,700 --> 00:04:59,738
Do you really want me to approach
Si Qingye to get the secret key?

59
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:00,619
Yes.

60
00:05:00,620 --> 00:05:01,579
Whatever it takes?

61
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:02,390
Yes.

62
00:05:02,739 --> 00:05:04,150
Okay, I'll go.

63
00:05:05,099 --> 00:05:06,029
Wuhui.

64
00:05:07,299 --> 00:05:08,989
Don't let me down.

65
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,190
(Si Qingye.)

66
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:12,510
(What if one day)

67
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,390
(I lied to you?)

68
00:05:15,539 --> 00:05:16,950
(Why would you lie to me?)

69
00:05:17,140 --> 00:05:18,710
(I can't bear to lie to you either.)

70
00:05:18,900 --> 00:05:19,619
(What did you say?)

71
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:22,029
(I said I like you.)

72
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:24,510
(Si Qingye.)

73
00:05:25,099 --> 00:05:26,789
(I never betrayed you)

74
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:29,019
(because I've fallen for you.)

75
00:05:29,020 --> 00:05:31,738
How dare you use
a fake secret key to deceive me

76
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:33,338
and disappear for seven years?

77
00:05:33,339 --> 00:05:35,218
You're bold.

78
00:05:35,219 --> 00:05:37,109
I've got what you want.

79
00:05:37,859 --> 00:05:39,270
Don't look for me again.

80
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:43,070
Do you like Si Qingye that much?

81
00:05:43,539 --> 00:05:44,899
But from the day

82
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:46,630
I rescued you from K,

83
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,459
I never thought
about letting you leave me.

84
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:50,310
Let go.

85
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:53,630
You said you'd let me go

86
00:05:53,859 --> 00:05:55,190
once I got Si Group's secret key.

87
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:57,298
What if I tell you I love you?

88
00:05:57,299 --> 00:05:59,270
Lu Xiao, don't be silly.

89
00:05:59,700 --> 00:06:01,669
You know nothing about love.

90
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:04,429
I remember.

91
00:06:07,460 --> 00:06:09,190
I remember everything now.

92
00:06:10,779 --> 00:06:12,070
Everything?

93
00:06:13,739 --> 00:06:16,229
I love Si Qingye all along.

94
00:06:31,020 --> 00:06:31,830
Sorry.

95
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,830
Sorry.

96
00:06:34,299 --> 00:06:35,909
I didn't mean it.

97
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,870
I didn't mean to hurt you either.

98
00:06:38,419 --> 00:06:39,750
I love you.

99
00:06:41,020 --> 00:06:42,390
Believe me.

100
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,750
Believe me.

101
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:51,549
Lu Xiao.

102
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,429
Let me go.

103
00:07:09,380 --> 00:07:10,789
Let you go?

104
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:12,830
Sure.

105
00:07:15,299 --> 00:07:16,549
Do you dare to go?

106
00:07:19,060 --> 00:07:20,109
You forgot.

107
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:23,270
You could only obey me

108
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:26,229
all this while.

109
00:07:33,179 --> 00:07:34,070
Lu Xiao

110
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,789
You know nothing about love.

111
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:47,310
Nothing started between us

112
00:07:47,779 --> 00:07:49,589
seven years ago.

113
00:07:52,099 --> 00:07:53,390
I'm now

114
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,270
