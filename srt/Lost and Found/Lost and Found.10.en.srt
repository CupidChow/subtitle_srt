All right. Stop drinking.

4
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,750
Leave me alone.

5
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:34,909
I'm going to control you.

Mommy.

11
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,949
What are you doing?

12
00:01:01,780 --> 00:01:02,499
Mommy.

13
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,469
- I'm fine.
- Mommy.

14
00:01:05,219 --> 00:01:06,029
Are you okay?

15
00:01:06,419 --> 00:01:07,990
Mommy.

16
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:12,739
Mommy, are you doing something bad?

17
00:01:12,740 --> 00:01:14,218
We're not doing anything bad.

18
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:15,150
No.

19
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,539
No.

20
00:01:16,540 --> 00:01:17,990
Yes, you did.

21
00:01:18,499 --> 00:01:19,790
No.

22
00:01:20,699 --> 00:01:22,109
I saw everything.

23
00:01:23,699 --> 00:01:25,389
No.

24
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:27,229
Really.

25
00:01:28,580 --> 00:01:30,790
I already said no.

26
00:01:55,380 --> 00:01:56,190
Wuhui.

27
00:01:57,779 --> 00:01:58,830
This time,

28
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:01,710
I'm not going to lose you again.

29
00:02:34,140 --> 00:02:35,658
You're noisy.

30
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,189
Are you letting me sleep?

31
00:02:37,379 --> 00:02:38,789
Are you trying to kill me?

32
00:02:39,099 --> 00:02:41,349
I've got something to do tomorrow.

33
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:43,699
I can't believe you, Si Qingye!

34
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,830
You're so noisy!

35
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,789
Si Qingye.

36
00:02:53,900 --> 00:02:55,670
You're so noisy!

37
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:58,218
I've got family business
to attend to at the docks tonight.

38
00:02:58,219 --> 00:02:59,338
Stop making noise.

39
00:02:59,339 --> 00:03:00,629
I'm warning you.

40
00:03:29,180 --> 00:03:30,670
Is the view here

41
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:32,230
nice?

42
00:03:32,779 --> 00:03:35,110
Mu Yaner, what do you want from me?

43
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,990
The Mu family has a big business.

44
00:03:38,020 --> 00:03:39,749
It's inappropriate

45
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,150
if you take it all by yourself.

46
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:44,840
Just get straight to the point.

47
00:03:45,659 --> 00:03:47,710
All of the Mu family's fortune
is originally mine.

48
00:03:47,779 --> 00:03:49,349
Why did you come back?

49
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:52,550
I'm throwing you in the sea tonight
to feed the fish.

50
00:04:13,539 --> 00:04:14,670
(It's past 10PM.)

51
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,589
(She hasn't come back from the dock.)

52
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:18,750
(Wuhui is most afraid of water.)

53
00:04:18,859 --> 00:04:19,989
(Is she in danger?)

54
00:04:20,419 --> 00:04:22,150
(No, I must check on her.)

55
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,150
I beg you.

56
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:27,390
Will you let me go?

57
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:31,270
Let you go?

58
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:33,909
No way.

59
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,349
Boys.

60
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:38,750
I think

61
00:04:39,539 --> 00:04:41,510
you're quite good-looking.

62
00:04:42,299 --> 00:04:43,750
Help me hold my bag.

63
00:05:11,859 --> 00:05:13,190
My bangs.

64
00:05:14,179 --> 00:05:15,229
Give me.

65
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,349
Give me.

66
00:05:17,700 --> 00:05:18,819
Give me!

67
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:20,190
Mu Yaner.

68
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:23,429
Don't let me see you wearing fake bangs

69
00:05:23,539 --> 00:05:26,270
again.

70
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,190
You...

71
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,349
My bangs.

72
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:38,710
You...

73
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:40,510
My bag, Handsome.

74
00:05:48,339 --> 00:05:50,390
My bangs.

75
00:05:51,659 --> 00:05:53,150
This woman

76
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,029
is so scary.

77
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:00,950
My bangs

78
00:06:04,299 --> 00:06:06,750
has become a memory.

79
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,549
You...

80
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:20,899
Why are you here?

81
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,270
Aren't you most afraid of water?

82
00:06:22,739 --> 00:06:23,870
Why did you come here?

83
00:06:24,700 --> 00:06:26,669
What do you mean?

84
00:06:26,979 --> 00:06:28,349
Ning Wuhui is most afraid of water.

85
00:06:30,020 --> 00:06:31,870
Are you doubting me again?

86
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:33,270
That's right.

87
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:36,310
You still think I'm Ning Wuhui.

88
00:06:36,419 --> 00:06:39,510
Even now you still doubt me,
don't you?

89
00:06:41,260 --> 00:06:41,989
Yes.

90
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:45,310
Yes, I'm afraid of water.

91
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,338
I'm afraid of a lot of things.

92
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:48,510
I'm afraid of you too.

93
00:06:48,979 --> 00:06:50,510
Can you get out of my sight?

94
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:53,669
You're Ning Wuhui.

95
00:06:53,979 --> 00:06:55,190
You might have lost your memory.

96
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,619
Think it over.

97
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:58,190
Maybe you'll remember something.

98
00:06:58,219 --> 00:06:59,218
Are you her?

99
00:06:59,219 --> 00:07:00,390
Think about it.

100
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,139
Ning Wuhui.

101
00:07:02,140 --> 00:07:03,379
Can you shut up?

102
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:04,338
I've heard this name

103
00:07:04,339 --> 00:07:05,830
many times.

104
00:07:06,179 --> 00:07:09,029
I'm Mu Yunge, the eldest granddaughter
of the Mu family.

105
00:07:10,659 --> 00:07:12,429
Why are you here for no apparent reason?

106
00:07:12,979 --> 00:07:13,418
Wuhui.

107
00:07:13,419 --> 00:07:14,669
Can you get lost?

108
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:20,139
Ms. Mu, do you want me to take you home?

109
00:07:20,140 --> 00:07:21,150
Shut up.

110
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,390
You can get lost too.

111
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:44,989
Boss.

112
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:47,989
Is it possible

113
00:07:48,260 --> 00:07:49,870
that she isn't Ning Wuhui?

114
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:08,870
(Si Qingye.)

115
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,429
(You're such a romantic.)

116
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,989
(She already said she isn't Ning Wuhui.)

117
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:14,418
(Yet you still can't forget about her)

118
00:08:14,419 --> 00:08:15,669
(and are obsessed with her.)

119
00:08:16,659 --> 00:08:17,658
(Ning Wuhui.)

120
00:08:17,659 --> 00:08:19,989
(I caused a car accident to kill you
and didn't tell Lu Xiao.)

121
00:08:20,060 --> 00:08:21,579
(Why are you still alive?)

122
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:23,229
