Mr. Lu.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,809
I've done what you told me to do.

5
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,809
Banking Regulatory Commission
has targeted him.

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:23,038
Soon,

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,809
their accounts will be frozen.

8
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:26,769
Good job.

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,289
But it's still not enough.

10
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:34,570
(Si Qingye.)

11
00:00:35,240 --> 00:00:36,810
(Wait and see.)

12
00:00:42,759 --> 00:00:43,570
Boss.

13
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:45,199
Sura has been spreading

14
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:46,639
false information about our company

15
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,890
to build momentum for us.

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:49,078
I'm confused

17
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:50,770
as to what his purpose is in doing so.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,049
I can't figure it out.

19
00:00:56,840 --> 00:00:57,649
Look at this.

20
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:04,958
In other words,

21
00:01:04,959 --> 00:01:07,849
someone used
many foreign virtual accounts

22
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,238
to illegally buy and sell
our company's stocks.

23
00:01:10,239 --> 00:01:12,039
He wants
Banking Regulatory Commission to step in

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,010
and freeze our stocks.

25
00:01:15,519 --> 00:01:17,010
He wants to freeze our cashflow.

26
00:01:18,319 --> 00:01:19,650
I suspect there's a mole in the company.

27
00:01:19,719 --> 00:01:20,839
Investigate Gu Xiao.

28
00:01:20,840 --> 00:01:21,769
Boss.

29
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,598
Why did you suddenly suspect Gu Xiao?

30
00:01:23,599 --> 00:01:24,839
Gu Xiao is a strong suspect.

31
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:25,730
I suspect

32
00:01:26,319 --> 00:01:27,679
what happened seven years ago
has something to do with her.

33
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,209
Okay, I'll look into it right away.

34
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:34,730
(Mu Yunge.)

35
00:01:35,319 --> 00:01:37,769
(I want to find the truth about
your car accident seven years ago.)

36
00:01:52,280 --> 00:01:53,049
Mom?

37
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,049
When did you come?

38
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,890
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

39
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,518
Yes.

40
00:02:02,519 --> 00:02:03,238
What do we do?

41
00:02:03,239 --> 00:02:04,849
I can't cook.

42
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:06,209
Jeez.

43
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:07,650
You lost your girlfriend

44
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:08,930
and couldn't even eat.

45
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:10,770
Aren't you pitiful?

46
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:14,129
Three days, okay?

47
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,598
Get her back.

48
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,129
Can you stay out of this?

49
00:02:18,039 --> 00:02:18,918
You young people

50
00:02:18,919 --> 00:02:20,718
should make up after an argument.

51
00:02:20,719 --> 00:02:22,250
It's not that big of a deal.

52
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:23,490
Why are you so stubborn?

53
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,169
You...

54
00:02:26,919 --> 00:02:27,569
Oh no.

55
00:02:28,039 --> 00:02:29,050
I remembered

56
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:31,119
that Yunge is sick this morning.

57
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,289
She fainted.

58
00:02:33,319 --> 00:02:34,090
No.

59
00:02:34,240 --> 00:02:34,849
She...

60
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:36,129
Where is she now?

61
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,169
Speak.

62
00:02:38,719 --> 00:02:39,650
I lied to you.

63
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:41,009
Dong Moli.

64
00:02:42,919 --> 00:02:45,169
Look, you're quite worried.

65
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:53,490
Actually, I

66
00:02:54,719 --> 00:02:55,559
really hope

67
00:02:55,560 --> 00:02:57,169
you two can make up.

68

Are you going?

70
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,050
Enough.

71
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,289
Could you stay out of it?

72
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:15,999
How did I give birth
to such a foolish son?

73
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,918
I'm telling you.

74
00:03:16,919 --> 00:03:17,999

75
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:19,198

76
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,569
I can't afford the humiliation, okay?

77
00:03:55,919 --> 00:03:56,718
Mommy.

78
00:03:56,719 --> 00:03:58,530
Is Daddy coming?

79
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,169
Probably not.

our birthday with us.
