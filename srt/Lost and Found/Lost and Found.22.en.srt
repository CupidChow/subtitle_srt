00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,980
=Episode 22=

3
00:00:48,299 --> 00:00:49,949
Are you still not going to let me go?

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,790
You told me before Buddha

5
00:00:56,100 --> 00:00:57,670
that I know nothing about love.

6
00:01:00,059 --> 00:01:01,909
I've been learning slowly.

7
00:01:07,499 --> 00:01:09,869
Later, they all said
I wasn't Lu Xiao anymore.

8
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:13,749
Speaking of which,
I changed my name for you.

9
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,389
My name is Lu Siao now.

10
00:01:22,859 --> 00:01:24,630
What a nice name.

11
00:01:28,699 --> 00:01:30,029
Look at this pair of hands.

12
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:31,990
They're pretty.

13
00:01:46,219 --> 00:01:47,070
Lu Xiao.

14
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:49,739
I

15
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:51,949
may have never felt love.

16
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:01,029
That mission

17
00:02:02,139 --> 00:02:03,669
and that betrayal

18
00:02:04,419 --> 00:02:06,070
numbed me.

19
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:08,309
I'm glad

20
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:10,909
that I got into
a car accident seven years ago.

21
00:02:11,980 --> 00:02:14,230
It helped me forget this painful memory.

22
00:02:18,779 --> 00:02:19,869
Why?

23
00:02:21,980 --> 00:02:23,189
Why?

24
00:02:23,659 --> 00:02:24,830
Why?

25
00:02:25,819 --> 00:02:28,430
Why am I the one
who's forgotten in your memory?

26
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:31,789
No.

27
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,749
No!

28
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:39,589
Because you can't give me

29
00:02:40,740 --> 00:02:42,069
what Si Qingye gives.

30
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:44,110
Lu Xiao.

31
00:02:45,059 --> 00:02:46,869
You disgust me.

32
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:53,270
You told me

33
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:56,029
that love is the most boring

34
00:02:56,619 --> 00:02:58,430
and most useless.

35
00:02:58,659 --> 00:03:00,710
Why do you get to love someone?

36
00:03:09,619 --> 00:03:10,589
It doesn't matter.

37
00:03:11,099 --> 00:03:12,789
We can take time with love.

38
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:16,230
I'm sure you'll come around.

39
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,950
This isn't love.

40
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:27,589
It's just your sick possessiveness.

41
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,749
No!

42
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:34,869
Here, look.

43
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,830
This is the same church.

44
00:03:37,740 --> 00:03:38,629
You said

45
00:03:38,900 --> 00:03:40,550
you like the holy light

46
00:03:41,260 --> 00:03:42,909
and white wedding dress the most.

47
00:03:50,619 --> 00:03:53,230
We can finally be together.

48
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,069
You're my bride.

49
00:04:01,219 --> 00:04:03,309
We're getting married.

50
00:04:06,499 --> 00:04:08,589
You're my bride.

51
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:13,909
You're my bride.

52
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,510
You're my bride.

53
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:44,549
Mr. Lu.

54
00:04:45,219 --> 00:04:47,510
Do you take Ms. Ning to be your wife?

55
00:04:47,659 --> 00:04:48,750
I do.

56
00:04:50,859 --> 00:04:51,789
Ms. Ning.

57
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:54,190
Do you take Mr. Lu as your husband?

58
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:23,870
Do you?

59
00:05:25,299 --> 00:05:26,469
Do you?

60
00:05:26,620 --> 00:05:27,669
Speak!

61
00:05:28,299 --> 00:05:29,390
Do you?

62
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:31,630
Speak.

63
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:34,150
Say you do!

64
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:36,778
Say you do!

65
00:05:36,779 --> 00:05:37,909
Say it.

66
00:05:38,779 --> 00:05:39,710
Say it!

67
00:05:40,099 --> 00:05:40,989
No.

68
00:05:45,299 --> 00:05:46,630
I refuse.

69
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,070
Say it.

70
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,858
I refuse.

71
00:05:49,859 --> 00:05:51,469
Say you do.

72
00:05:52,020 --> 00:05:53,349
Say it!

73
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,669
I refuse!

74
00:05:58,580 --> 00:05:59,830
No.

75
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,950
I refuse.

76
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:24,870
I refuse.

77
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:38,150
Over there.

78
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:49,589
Darling, I'm here to take you home.

79
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:31,989
Mr. Lu.

80
00:07:32,219 --> 00:07:33,429
Si Qingye's here.

81
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,109

82
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:42,710
