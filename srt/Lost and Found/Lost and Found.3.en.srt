I don't mind telling you

10
00:00:42,939 --> 00:00:45,359
that Mu Yunge is mine.

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:46,578
How exciting.

00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:48,480
Mr. Si likes Ms. Mu.

13
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:51,319
Did they know each other before this?

14
00:00:51,820 --> 00:00:52,859
- Hurry and apologize.
- I...

15
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:54,840
I didn't mean it, Mr. Si.

16
00:00:59,659 --> 00:01:00,760
Sorry.

Wait for me.

Aren't you the Mu family's heiress?

21
00:01:18,740 --> 00:01:20,280
Are you just going to
let others bully you?

22
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:21,960
Thank you.

23
00:01:22,499 --> 00:01:23,439

- I...

24
00:01:27,219 --> 00:01:28,439
I... I'll leave first.

Don't you think
you came at a bad time?

27
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:38,800
No, Boss. This garden is so big that I've
looked for you for a long time.

28
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:39,778
I have something important.

This is my company.

107
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:26,819
But I think

108
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,039
I don't quite fit in
with your company's style.

109
00:06:29,140 --> 00:06:29,959
Stop.

110
00:06:31,380 --> 00:06:32,760

111
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,178
What... What am I scared of?

112
00:06:35,179 --> 00:06:37,360
You're scared
that I'll know you're Ning Wuhui.

113
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,159
Am I that attractive to you?

114

115
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:48,178
not to waste your time on me.

116
00:06:48,179 --> 00:06:50,200

119
00:06:52,539 --> 00:06:55,259

120
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,200
What am I afraid of?

121
00:06:57,900 --> 00:07:00,699
