00:00:13,300 --> 00:00:15,980
=Episode 14=

3
00:00:30,299 --> 00:00:31,070
Ye.

4
00:00:32,220 --> 00:00:33,470
You have the nerve to see me.

5
00:00:40,540 --> 00:00:41,829
I asked you to come here today

6
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:43,390
because I have something to tell you.

7
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:46,350
One,

8
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:48,430
leave MK Company.

9
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:50,629
Two,

10
00:00:51,540 --> 00:00:53,390
work in the branch overseas.

11
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:55,750
Are you kicking me out?

12
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:57,710
Why?

13
00:00:58,019 --> 00:00:59,549
How dare you ask why?

14
00:01:01,019 --> 00:01:03,229
You're responsible for
Mu Yunge's brake failure, aren't you?

15
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:05,749
If I hadn't been in her car today,

16
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:07,589
you would have killed her.

17
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,218
Sorry, Ye.

18
00:01:10,219 --> 00:01:12,550
I... I didn't know
you would drive her car.

19
00:01:13,499 --> 00:01:14,790
I'm glad you're okay.

20
00:01:15,219 --> 00:01:16,459
I just wanted to teach her a lesson

21
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:17,749
and make her leave you.

22
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,710
Have you lost your mind?

23
00:01:23,499 --> 00:01:24,270
Get lost!

24
00:01:29,180 --> 00:01:30,270
I'm sorry.

25
00:01:43,820 --> 00:01:44,858
The five gold accessories

26
00:01:44,859 --> 00:01:46,498
are gold necklace, gold earrings,

27
00:01:46,499 --> 00:01:47,749
gold ring, gold bracelet,

28
00:01:47,779 --> 00:01:49,379
and gold bangle.

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:51,058
My daughter-in-law is beautiful.

30
00:01:51,059 --> 00:01:53,150
I must get all of them for her.

31
00:01:54,580 --> 00:01:55,509
Madam.

32
00:01:55,859 --> 00:01:59,618
Isn't that a little too fast?

33
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,899
No.

34
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:03,099
When I got married,

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,229
I said yes once I received
the five gold accessories.

36
00:02:11,740 --> 00:02:15,029
Isn't this too exaggerated?

37
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,739
Yunge is so good-looking.

38
00:02:18,740 --> 00:02:19,909
Let me buy you some more.

39
00:02:19,939 --> 00:02:20,699
More?

40
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:22,618
Of course.

41
00:02:22,619 --> 00:02:24,349
I want to buy a lot.

42
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:25,950
Madam, this way.

43
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:30,538
This ruyi looks good.

44
00:02:30,539 --> 00:02:31,338
Ruyi.

45
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,459
- Just like what I wanted.
- Okay.

46
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,139
I want it!

47
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:33,990
Okay.

48
00:02:35,939 --> 00:02:37,098
This horse looks good too.

49
00:02:37,099 --> 00:02:39,749
Immediate success. Immediate marriage.

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:41,710
Wrap them all up!

51
00:02:41,740 --> 00:02:42,550
Okay.

52
00:02:42,779 --> 00:02:43,670
This feels so good.

53
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,979
Let me tell you.

54
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:48,349
What is real?

55
00:02:48,379 --> 00:02:50,019
What's real is what you can hold.

56
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:50,938
What you can hold

57
00:02:50,939 --> 00:02:51,899
and what's by your side

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:52,938
are real.

59
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,749
We women must hold real things.

60
00:02:55,980 --> 00:02:57,658
Being in a relationship with my son,

61
00:02:57,659 --> 00:02:59,699
you'll get to hold real gold and silver.

62
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,990
I'm the boss.

63
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:29,150
I've given you MK's data for this month.

64
00:03:30,379 --> 00:03:31,818
The company's assets

65
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,390
are transferred overseas in batches.

66
00:03:33,539 --> 00:03:34,789
I've done everything

67
00:03:34,900 --> 00:03:36,069
you asked me to do.

68
00:04:22,339 --> 00:04:23,630
I warn you.

69
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,669
Mu Yunge's mine.

70
00:04:26,179 --> 00:04:27,989
If you touch her again,

71
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:30,669
you'll be the next one

72
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,429
to die.

73
00:04:37,779 --> 00:04:38,630
Get lost.

74
00:05:13,979 --> 00:05:14,870
Yunge.

75
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,750
Where are you?

76
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:18,429
What's the matter?

77
00:05:19,900 --> 00:05:21,229
I'm not feeling well.

78
00:05:21,580 --> 00:05:23,109
Can you come and see me?

79
00:05:24,299 --> 00:05:26,109
I just passed by your door.

80
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,349
I'll come see you.

81
00:05:27,979 --> 00:05:28,870
That's great.

82
00:05:29,179 --> 00:05:30,750
I'll wait for you at home.

83
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,310
What's the matter?

84
00:05:57,099 --> 00:05:57,909
Yunge.

85
00:05:58,739 --> 00:06:01,150
I feel weak.

86
00:06:01,859 --> 00:06:03,349
My heart hurts.

87
00:06:04,419 --> 00:06:05,710
I can't keep my eyes open.

88
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:07,989
What do I do?

89
00:06:11,020 --> 00:06:11,909
Let me see.

90
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:13,469
Is it here?

91
00:06:14,419 --> 00:06:15,098
Where is it?

92
00:06:15,099 --> 00:06:16,549
-Up here.
-Is this this leg?

93
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:18,029
Up here.

94
00:06:18,739 --> 00:06:19,589
Here.

95
00:06:26,140 --> 00:06:27,549
What do you want then?

96
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,750
I want that thing?

97
00:06:30,859 --> 00:06:31,830
What thing?

98
00:06:32,900 --> 00:06:33,819
That thing the other day.

99
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,270
Which one?

100
00:06:45,060 --> 00:06:46,070
Okay.

101
00:06:46,260 --> 00:06:47,229
I'll give it to you.

102
00:06:49,099 --> 00:06:50,070
Close your eyes.

103
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,950
Stop acting.

104
00:07:04,419 --> 00:07:05,950
My wounds haven't even healed.

105
00:07:06,339 --> 00:07:07,619
The doctor said

106
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:08,870
we're fine.

107
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:11,549
Mu Yunge.

108
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,229
I'm serious.

109
00:07:14,659 --> 00:07:16,429
We've even met the parents.

110
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,390
Madam is nice.

111
00:07:22,940 --> 00:07:24,310
I'm nice to you too.

112
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:26,098
Besides,

113
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:27,349
We even have children.

114
00:07:27,779 --> 00:07:29,469
I have to take care of you and the kids.

115
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:32,070
When are we getting married?

116
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:35,909
Slow down.

117
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,870
Haste makes waste.

118
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:39,630
You'll have to try harder.

119
00:08:20,739 --> 00:08:21,589
Looks like

120
00:08:22,260 --> 00:08:23,710
