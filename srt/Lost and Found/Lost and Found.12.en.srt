=Episode 12=

3
00:00:28,139 --> 00:00:29,258
How are you?

4
00:00:29,259 --> 00:00:30,430
Hey.

5
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:33,378
I'm fine.

6
00:00:33,379 --> 00:00:34,589
Thank you. And you?

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,470
Are you single?

8
00:00:38,019 --> 00:00:39,338
This is my wife.

9
00:00:39,339 --> 00:00:40,829
Okay.

10
00:00:41,939 --> 00:00:43,350
What happened?

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:44,829
So crazy.

12
00:00:50,740 --> 00:00:52,110
Hi, Pretty.

13
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:54,790
Hi, Handsome.

14
00:01:05,259 --> 00:01:05,990
Boss.

15
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:14,469
Hello.

16
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,070
Boss.

17
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:18,949
What's going on with Sura?

18
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:21,258
Sura has too many helpers in China.

19
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:24,550
It's hard to find his whereabouts
anytime soon.

20
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,019
(Baobei)

21
00:01:30,020 --> 00:01:31,029
Mr. Si.

22
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:32,579
Mommy lost weight.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:34,299
Why are you not back yet?

24
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,350
Where on earth are you?

25
00:01:39,499 --> 00:01:40,509
What are you looking at?

26
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,790
Book me the soonest flight home.

27
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,659
But Boss,

28
00:01:44,660 --> 00:01:45,939
Tomorrow, we...

29
00:01:45,940 --> 00:01:47,589
Thailand's supplier. I...

30
00:01:47,859 --> 00:01:49,270
Reschedule it later.

31
00:01:49,660 --> 00:01:50,469
No.

32
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:16,179
Boss.

33
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:18,058
Did you come back
all the way from Thailand

34
00:02:18,059 --> 00:02:19,629
just to get shut down?

35
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:22,990
No, what are you talking about?

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,739
I was ready to be a male babysitter

37
00:02:24,740 --> 00:02:26,550
so that you can date.

38
00:02:26,619 --> 00:02:27,990
Ms. Mu...

39
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,069
Right?

40
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:33,789
Mr. Si.

41
00:02:34,020 --> 00:02:36,069
Mommy won't let us
open the door for you.

42
00:02:36,779 --> 00:02:37,938
Mr. Si.

43
00:02:37,939 --> 00:02:40,218
Mommy said
you left without saying goodbye.

44
00:02:40,219 --> 00:02:41,618
She's mad

45
00:02:41,619 --> 00:02:43,589
and wants to sever ties with you.

46
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:45,789
I... Let me...

47
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:58,110
Boss.

48
00:02:58,619 --> 00:03:00,589
Sura is in Jiang City.

49
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,950
Starting tomorrow, work with the police
on their investigation on Sura.

50
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:09,309
We must find them.

51
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:10,309
Okay.

52
00:03:34,659 --> 00:03:35,349
You...

53
00:03:37,219 --> 00:03:38,270
How did you get in?

54
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,629
I sneaked in.

55
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:42,469
Xingxing, Baobei.

56
00:03:42,819 --> 00:03:44,658
They're asleep.
It's just the two of us now.

57
00:03:44,659 --> 00:03:47,150
Keep your distance from me.

58
00:03:47,419 --> 00:03:49,370
- I'm just gonna say a few words.
- I don't want to listen.

59
00:03:51,499 --> 00:03:52,670
Okay.

60
00:03:55,499 --> 00:03:56,430
What's that...

61
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:00,830
This

62
00:04:01,939 --> 00:04:04,349
was given to me by a handsome guy.

63
00:04:10,580 --> 00:04:12,869
Is it Mr. X?

64
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:15,430
Yes.

65
00:04:16,099 --> 00:04:17,589
It's X.

66
00:04:20,580 --> 00:04:22,098
How can you

67
00:04:22,099 --> 00:04:23,538
just take other people's stuff?

68
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,549
He's better looking than you.

69
00:04:25,179 --> 00:04:26,109
He's taller than you.

70
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:28,109
How tall is he?

71
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,150
This tall.

72
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,630
Do you like superficial things?

73
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:37,669
At least he's taller than you.

74
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:40,229
Tall.

75
00:04:44,859 --> 00:04:45,549
You.

76
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,390
Get out.

77
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:11,510
(Is he really mad?)

78
00:05:12,099 --> 00:05:14,070
(Who told you to leave
without saying goodbye?)

79
00:05:14,380 --> 00:05:15,699
(I'm still mad at you.)

80
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:16,579
Xingxing.

81
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,379
How do we stop Mommy

82
00:05:18,380 --> 00:05:20,459
from staying mad at Mr. Si?

83
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:21,510
I don't know.

84
00:05:22,419 --> 00:05:25,178
In TV shows, they make up after kissing.

85
00:05:25,179 --> 00:05:27,310
Mr. Si is so incompetent.

86
00:05:27,620 --> 00:05:28,418
Mu Baobei.

87
00:05:28,419 --> 00:05:29,778
What TV shows do you secretly watch

88
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,390
on your iPad?

89
00:05:35,020 --> 00:05:35,858
Who is it?

90
00:05:35,859 --> 00:05:37,429
If you don't come out,
I'll call the police.

91
00:05:37,659 --> 00:05:38,510
Don't.

92
00:05:42,739 --> 00:05:44,029
It's me.

93
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,950
Pretty Grandma?

94
00:05:46,820 --> 00:05:48,418
May I come in?

95
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:50,190
Yes, come in.

96
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,459
Where do I sit?

97
00:05:53,460 --> 00:05:55,259
You can sit on this pig.

98
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:55,989
Yes.

99
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:57,750
Sit.

100
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,710
Grandma, this is for you.

101
00:06:04,339 --> 00:06:05,950
Thank you.

102
00:06:06,219 --> 00:06:08,190
Darling, thank you.

103
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,390
Actually,

104
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:15,270
I came to see you two today.

105
00:06:15,299 --> 00:06:16,019
Pretty Grandma.

106
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:17,538
Even if you pay me five million yuan,

107
00:06:17,539 --> 00:06:19,789
I won't Mommy leave Mr. Si.

108
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,098
Ten million yuan
can be considered though.

109
00:06:23,099 --> 00:06:24,019
Baobei.

110
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,349
A father is worth more
than 10 million yuan.

111
00:06:27,460 --> 00:06:28,950
I came here

112
00:06:28,979 --> 00:06:32,059
just to ask you two

113
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:33,270
if you're willing

114
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:36,109
to have my son as your father.

115
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:41,390
Aren't you here
to separate my mommy and Mr. Si?

116
00:06:41,979 --> 00:06:43,830
I'm not that old-fashioned.

117
00:06:43,979 --> 00:06:45,858
I've been observing

118
00:06:45,859 --> 00:06:47,229
your mom and the two of you

119
00:06:47,299 --> 00:06:48,459
for a long time.

120
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,029
Have you been stalking us?

121
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,669
That's not a good way to say it.

122
00:06:54,299 --> 00:06:55,310
Actually,

123
00:06:55,419 --> 00:06:56,469
I think

124
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:57,939
your mom

125
00:06:57,940 --> 00:07:00,589
doesn't seem to like my son very much,

126
00:07:01,779 --> 00:07:04,190
so I'm thinking

127
00:07:05,339 --> 00:07:07,750
if you're willing,

128
00:07:07,940 --> 00:07:09,830
how about we...

129
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:11,909
Assist them?

130
00:07:12,140 --> 00:07:13,070
Assist them.

131
00:07:13,779 --> 00:07:14,939
Okay, here.

132
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,109
One, two...

133
00:07:16,179 --> 00:07:16,909
Three.

134
00:07:21,099 --> 00:07:22,510
Has Mu Yunge come to work?

135
00:07:23,659 --> 00:07:25,579
Boss, it's the weekend today.

136
00:07:25,580 --> 00:07:27,139
She isn't obliged to come to work.

137
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:27,978
Has Ms. Mu forgiven you

138
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:29,469
for what happened last time?

139
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:34,658
I don't know.

140
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,989
Let me change the question then.

141
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:38,630
Boss, do you like Ms. Mu?

142
00:07:38,700 --> 00:07:40,029
Or

143
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:43,349
it's because Ms. Mu
looks a bit like that person.

144
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:44,619
I guess this is why Ms. Mu...

145
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:45,870
It's because she's Mu Yunge.

146
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:47,909
Then you have to tell her!

147
00:07:48,060 --> 00:07:50,270
Ye Ye.

148
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:53,190
Punk, you're finally back.

149
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:55,019
Mom.

150
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:55,789
Sit.

151
00:07:56,979 --> 00:07:57,870
Look.

152
00:07:58,179 --> 00:07:59,070
Mom.

153
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,579
Could you knock on the door

154
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,150
before you enter my office?

155
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:06,538
Why knock on the door
to enter my son's room?

156
00:08:06,539 --> 00:08:07,858
Look.

157
00:08:07,859 --> 00:08:08,750
Don't they look alike?

158
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,669
Don't they look alike?

159
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:12,699
Isn't this me?

160
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:14,190
Let me see, Madam.

161
00:08:15,419 --> 00:08:17,150
Darn, they look exactly the same.

162
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:18,499
But the paternity...

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,589
What paternity?

164
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,229
Chen Ge's right.

165
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:26,830
You were born
to be Xingxing's stepfather.

166
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,310
Mom.

167
00:08:29,859 --> 00:08:31,429
That's not a nice way to put it.

168
00:08:31,580 --> 00:08:33,230
I don't know if I should be happy.

169
00:08:33,579 --> 00:08:35,029
I'm quite happy anyway.

170
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,818
Chen Ge already told me

171
00:08:36,819 --> 00:08:39,829
that Mu Yunge
is the person you dated seven years ago.

172
00:08:39,860 --> 00:08:40,339
Look.

173
00:08:40,340 --> 00:08:43,309
Xingxing and Baobei
look so much like you.

174
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,859
I think
they're my grandson and granddaughter.

175
00:08:45,860 --> 00:08:48,709
I support you to pursue Mu Yunge.

176
00:08:50,179 --> 00:08:52,309
Have you done nothing?

177
00:08:53,079 --> 00:08:54,818
How long has it been?
Why haven't you done anything?

178
00:08:54,819 --> 00:08:55,698
You have to do something.

179
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:57,499
If you do nothing, how can I give away

180
00:08:57,500 --> 00:08:58,778
my courtyard house in Beijing

181
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,309
and those buildings in Shanghai?

182
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:02,870
You're killing me.

183
00:09:03,299 --> 00:09:05,458
I won't be able to give them away
even when I'm 80.

184
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:07,350
I won't be able to give them away.

185
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,029
Madam,
I think you're worrying too much.

186
00:09:10,779 --> 00:09:11,669
Did he do something?

187
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,619
No, not really.

188
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,379
I just think

189
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:15,069
you'll succeed before you're 70.

190
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:15,870
Darn you.

191
00:09:18,659 --> 00:09:19,350
