3
00:00:21,299 --> 00:00:22,659
I've got work to do.

4
00:00:22,660 --> 00:00:24,098
Why did you bring me here?

5
00:00:24,099 --> 00:00:25,270
Take you around

6
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:28,829
and have a look.

7
00:00:30,939 --> 00:00:32,269
It's a shark.

8
00:00:36,379 --> 00:00:37,269
Mu Yunge.

9
00:00:40,579 --> 00:00:41,779
My phone and bank card passwords

10
00:00:41,780 --> 00:00:42,698
are the same.

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:45,509
Besides Si Group,

13
00:00:45,579 --> 00:00:47,189
I own a dozen venture capital firms.

14
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:49,258
We already have two adorable kids,

15
00:00:49,259 --> 00:00:50,618
so it's up to you to decide

16
00:00:50,619 --> 00:00:51,859
whether you want kids
after we get married.

17
00:00:51,860 --> 00:00:52,978
You like strawberries and cheese.

18
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:54,298
You dislike cilantro and onions.

19
00:00:54,299 --> 00:00:55,139
I dislike onions either,

20
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,338
but I love cilantro.

21
00:00:56,339 --> 00:00:58,070
But I can give up cilantro for you.

22
00:00:58,780 --> 00:01:00,509
Can I marry you?

23
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:22,109

finally proposed.

00:03:25,939 --> 00:03:26,338
Yes.

58
00:03:26,339 --> 00:03:26,899
Think about it.

59
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,299
Our courtyard houses in Beijing,

60
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,909
office towers in Shanghai,

61
00:03:29,939 --> 00:03:31,098
and the villas in France.

62
00:03:31,099 --> 00:03:32,270
Hurry and make the arrangements.

63
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:32,618
Okay.

64
00:03:32,619 --> 00:03:33,259
The key

65
00:03:33,260 --> 00:03:35,299
is that I finally
have someone to pass on

66
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,749
the jewelry I collected over the years.

67
00:03:39,020 --> 00:03:40,629
Madam, why don't you sit here?

68
00:03:40,779 --> 00:03:41,510
No.

69
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,909
I like my yellow pig.

70
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:50,069
A few days ago, someone told me

71
00:03:50,219 --> 00:03:52,069
that her daughter-in-law is pregnant.

72
00:03:53,180 --> 00:03:54,459
What's so great about that?

73
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:54,979
Yeah.

74
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:57,349
Look, I gained two grandkids right away.

75
00:03:57,580 --> 00:04:00,150
And I have a grandson
and a granddaughter.

76
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:02,270
They're adorable.

77
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:07,510
Spring feels so good.

78
00:04:11,180 --> 00:04:12,510
Are you married?

79
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:14,378
Madam, I...

80
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,310
Hurry up.

81
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:28,669
Mr. Lu.

82
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:30,579
Si Qingye and Mu Yunge
are going to have their wedding

83
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,710
in a few days.

84
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:49,190
Si Qingye.

85
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:54,310
You always seem to be
one step ahead of me.

86
00:05:20,979 --> 00:05:21,710
This way.

87
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:23,710
This church is quite majestic.

88
00:05:23,979 --> 00:05:24,870
Is it here?

89
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:25,870
It's here.

90
00:05:27,820 --> 00:05:28,259
We're here.

91
00:05:28,260 --> 00:05:28,699
Thank you.

92
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:29,819
Congratulations.

93
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:30,630
Congratulations.

94
00:05:31,219 --> 00:05:32,029
Congratulations.

95
00:05:32,299 --> 00:05:33,150
Okay.

96
00:05:33,260 --> 00:05:34,699
Mr. Mu, take a photo with me.

97
00:05:34,700 --> 00:05:35,789
I'll help you take the photo.

98
00:05:37,099 --> 00:05:37,939
Thank you.

99
00:05:37,940 --> 00:05:38,218
Thank you, Mr. Mu.

100
00:05:38,219 --> 00:05:39,019
Congratulations.

101
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:39,669
Thank you.

102
00:05:40,659 --> 00:05:41,538
Hello.

103
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,019
Congratulations.

104
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,499
Congratulations.

105
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,909
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

106
00:05:51,219 --> 00:05:51,899
Mr. Mu.

107
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:52,909
Go and play first.

108
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,710
Hello, Mr. Mu.

109
00:06:01,419 --> 00:06:03,710
I hit it off very well
with Xingxing and Baobei

110
00:06:03,820 --> 00:06:06,390
when I first met them.

111
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,538
Yunge

112
00:06:07,539 --> 00:06:10,190
is my daughter-in-law.

113
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:12,109
Moli.

114
00:06:12,299 --> 00:06:13,909
You're still a step behind.

115
00:06:14,179 --> 00:06:15,778
When Yunge first got back,

116
00:06:15,779 --> 00:06:17,658
Qingye came to my house.

117
00:06:17,659 --> 00:06:19,510
At that time, I knew

118
00:06:19,620 --> 00:06:24,259
Qingye will become
the Mu family's son-in-law.

119
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:26,059
All my houses in the city center

120
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:28,109
will be used as betrothal gifts.

121
00:06:29,099 --> 00:06:30,738
The Mu family plans to give
all our newly bought lands

122
00:06:30,739 --> 00:06:32,229
to Yunge as dowries.

123
00:06:33,299 --> 00:06:33,978
Xingxing and Baobei

124
00:06:33,979 --> 00:06:36,390
loves me.

125
00:06:37,940 --> 00:06:39,750
We're related by blood.

126
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:40,870
The two of them

127
00:06:40,940 --> 00:06:43,390
call me Great Grandpa non-stop.

128
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:47,589
They call me Pretty Grandma.

129
00:06:55,299 --> 00:06:56,989
I'm more senior than you.

130
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,669
You're older.

131
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:06,870
Actually,

132
00:07:07,659 --> 00:07:09,310
as long as they're happy,

133
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:12,390
it doesn't matter

134
00:07:12,419 --> 00:07:13,950
who married who, right?

135
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:18,870
Mr. Mu.

136
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,298
That's also what I mean.

137
00:07:20,299 --> 00:07:20,978
Yes.

138
00:07:20,979 --> 00:07:22,819
So it's called a win-win situation

139
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,619
for both our families.

140
00:07:24,620 --> 00:07:25,750
Yes.

141
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,899
Keep up with the times.

142
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,549
Keep up with the times.

143
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:30,379
I like it.

144
00:07:30,380 --> 00:07:31,429
Yes.

145
00:07:32,460 --> 00:07:33,070
Okay.

146
00:07:33,219 --> 00:07:34,109
Yes.

147
00:07:37,859 --> 00:07:38,538
Okay.

148
00:07:38,539 --> 00:07:39,750
I'll be there soon.

149
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:48,390
How come no one's here to see me?

150
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,098
Hello, Mr. Si.

151
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:53,738
Congratulations, Mr. Si.

152
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,429

153
00:08:02,739 --> 00:08:03,390

154
00:08:03,620 --> 00:08:05,349
