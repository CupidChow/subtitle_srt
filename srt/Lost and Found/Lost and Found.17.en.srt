3
00:00:21,220 --> 00:00:21,919
Who is it?

4
00:00:22,099 --> 00:00:23,879
It's me, your husband.

5
00:00:23,979 --> 00:00:24,879
Open the door.

6
00:00:25,220 --> 00:00:27,439
Who... Who are you calling your wife?

7
00:00:27,979 --> 00:00:28,938
It's not like you've never met me.

8
00:00:28,939 --> 00:00:30,039
Hurry and open the door.

9
00:00:30,099 --> 00:00:31,320
No.

10
00:00:32,740 --> 00:00:33,739
I'll just take a glance.

11
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,919
I'll leave after taking a glance.

12
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:38,219
They all said that the groom

13
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:40,599
can't meet the bride before the wedding.

14
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:42,400
Those are all lies.

15
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:44,499
Darling, I beg you.

16
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:45,338
Open the door.

17
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:46,219
Why are you here?

18
00:00:46,220 --> 00:00:47,559
The pastor is looking for you
to go through the speech.

19
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:49,800
What speech?

20
00:00:50,979 --> 00:00:52,559
I want true feelings for my wedding.

21
00:00:56,820 --> 00:00:58,559
Is it the "I do" part?

22
00:01:09,979 --> 00:01:11,400

such an important occasion?

Lu Siao?

00:02:29,499 --> 00:02:31,280
You should call me

40
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:32,839
Lu Xiao.

41
00:02:33,619 --> 00:02:34,919
Lu Xiao?

42
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:37,919
It's you again.

43
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:39,359
Sir.

44
00:02:39,539 --> 00:02:40,459
It's my wedding today.

45
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,338
Lu Xiao?

46
00:02:41,339 --> 00:02:42,859
Please take a seat

47
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,959
if you want to attend.

48
00:02:44,339 --> 00:02:46,000
If you have other purposes...

49
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:47,720
Chen Ge.

50
00:02:50,619 --> 00:02:51,480
Well...

51
00:02:56,740 --> 00:02:58,839
Looks like I came at a bad time.

52
00:03:31,779 --> 00:03:33,280
Do you remember anything?

53
00:03:37,379 --> 00:03:39,079
I have your son.

54
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:45,440
Come to see me alone.

55
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:19,399
(Lu Xiao?)

56
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:32,639
Yunge.

57
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,839
What did he say to you?

58
00:04:37,339 --> 00:04:38,159
Wait for me.

59
00:04:42,779 --> 00:04:44,120
Why did she leave?

60
00:04:44,779 --> 00:04:45,978
The bride's gone.

61
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:47,159
Why did she leave?

62
00:04:48,620 --> 00:04:50,159
What about the wedding?

63
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:52,240
(Don't leave me.)

64
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,240
(Why?)

65
00:04:54,820 --> 00:04:56,719
(Why did you leave me seven years ago)

66
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:58,719
(and now you're leaving me again?)

67
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:04,778
Why did she run away?

68
00:05:04,779 --> 00:05:06,200
Go after her.

69
00:05:06,219 --> 00:05:07,440
Get her.

70
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:08,338
Yunge.

71
00:05:08,339 --> 00:05:09,059
Boss.

72
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,858
Boss.

73
00:05:09,859 --> 00:05:10,579
Boss, we have a problem.

74
00:05:10,580 --> 00:05:11,680
Xingxing's gone.

75
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:14,880
Xingxing.

76
00:05:15,179 --> 00:05:15,920
Xingxing.

77
00:05:16,179 --> 00:05:17,000
Xingxing!

78
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:18,800
Xingxing!

79
00:05:19,380 --> 00:05:20,599
- Xingxing.
- Xingxing!

80
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,760
Xingxing.

81
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,279
- Xingxing.
- Xingxing.

82
00:05:26,900 --> 00:05:27,920
Baobei, slow down.

83
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,440
Yunge.

84
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:02,360
Why aren't you
answering your phone, Yunge?

85
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,159
Where's my son?

86
00:06:27,779 --> 00:06:29,039
Who are you?

87
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,159
Why did you kidnap my son?

88
00:06:31,539 --> 00:06:33,479
Do we have a feud?

89
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,360
Speak!

90
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,360
I have your son.

91
00:06:51,179 --> 00:06:52,399
Defeat them

92
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:54,360
and I'll return your son to you.

93
00:07:26,859 --> 00:07:27,880
Good.

94
00:07:28,659 --> 00:07:29,839
Excellent.

95
00:07:37,219 --> 00:07:38,639
Give me back my son.

96
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,399
You're good.

97
00:07:50,539 --> 00:07:51,599
Wuhui.

98
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,159
