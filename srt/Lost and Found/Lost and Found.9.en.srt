We haven't found his exact location.

78
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:54,110
That night,

79
00:03:55,300 --> 00:03:57,510
thanks for getting there
in time and saving me.

80
00:04:02,539 --> 00:04:04,430
Do you think you can get rid of me
just by thanking me?

81
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:05,749
How tacky.

82
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,869
Thank you.

83
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:14,378
You even brought them gifts.

84
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:15,950
I'm someone with a sense of ceremony.

85
00:04:17,140 --> 00:04:18,190
I treat you the same way.

86
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:21,669
Besides, they're cute.

87
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:23,619
That's because

88
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:26,029
you've never seen them making a fuss.

89
00:04:26,299 --> 00:04:27,469
But

90
00:04:27,779 --> 00:04:29,229
I don't know

91
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,950
why they like pestering you.

92
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,390
You can reject them.

93
00:04:32,859 --> 00:04:33,870
Why would I reject them?

94
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,630
I like them very much.

95
00:04:35,659 --> 00:04:36,750
Let's see who runs faster.

96
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,510
If

97
00:04:42,739 --> 00:04:44,750
you're a dad,

98
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,630
you should be a good one.

99
00:04:53,820 --> 00:04:55,150
Actually,

100
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:57,870
I thought
you were quite annoying at first.

101
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,830
Now it seems like

102
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:02,589
you're a good...

103
00:05:04,219 --> 00:05:05,349
Good neighbor.

104
00:05:06,979 --> 00:05:08,019
Finish this.

105
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,939
And we'll wipe the slate clean.

106
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,989
Wipe the slate clean?

107
00:05:12,979 --> 00:05:13,909
It's not that easy.

108
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:18,870
Forget it then.

109
00:05:39,859 --> 00:05:40,909
You're drinking so much.

110
00:05:42,779 --> 00:05:43,710
Cheers.

111
00:06:00,979 --> 00:06:01,789
You're back.

112
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:06,349
Long time no see.

114
00:06:10,179 --> 00:06:11,789
How are you at Si Group?

115
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:14,150
Everything is just as usual.

116
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:16,789
It's been seven years
and you still haven't gotten Si Qingye.

117
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,150
How useless.

118
00:06:21,979 --> 00:06:24,190
If I hadn't helped you
get the secret key

119
00:06:24,419 --> 00:06:26,190
and stole
Si Group's tens of millions of dollars,

120
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:28,710
Sura wouldn't have been able to grow.

121
00:06:29,060 --> 00:06:31,549
And you wouldn't have enjoyed
all those years abroad.

122
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:35,330

123
00:06:38,179 --> 00:06:39,978

125
00:06:43,859 --> 00:06:45,150
I've given you the secret key.

126
00:06:46,219 --> 00:06:47,989
I don't care what happens to Si Group.

127
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,830
All I want is Si Qingye.

128
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,029
Don't worry.

00:06:57,099 --> 00:06:59,270
I'm more afraid of them falling in love
than you are.

00:07:02,079 --> 00:07:03,320
It's my pleasure to work with you.

132
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:11,549
I didn't get Si Qingye

133
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:13,178
because she's back.

134
00:07:13,179 --> 00:07:15,270
Since you've had a crush on her
for so many years,

135
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:16,658
take her back.

136
00:07:16,659 --> 00:07:19,429
