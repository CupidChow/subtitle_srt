=Episode 15=

3
00:00:17,779 --> 00:00:18,709
Xingxing.

4
00:00:18,820 --> 00:00:20,578
I'm going to Jing City
for a business trip tonight.

5
00:00:20,579 --> 00:00:21,910
I won't be coming home tonight.

6
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:23,470
Okay, Mommy.

7
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,389
Do your homework.

8
00:00:25,579 --> 00:00:27,070
Don't watch
too many short dramas.

9
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:32,589
We meet again.

10
00:00:33,619 --> 00:00:34,790
It's you.

11
00:00:37,379 --> 00:00:40,269
You're not the organizer, are you?

12
00:00:41,699 --> 00:00:44,269
Would you do me the honor
of having dinner with me?

13
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:46,539
Mr. Lu Siao.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:49,110
I think I've already rejected you.

15
00:00:49,979 --> 00:00:50,698
Of course.

16
00:00:50,699 --> 00:00:52,378
If it's a job requirement,

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:53,869
just consider that I think too much.

18
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:57,189
You're not rejecting me
the courtesy of a meal, are you?

19
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:01,869
This way.

20
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:22,350
Mr. Si, you're so stupid.

21
00:01:23,139 --> 00:01:24,218
Why did you say so?

22
00:01:24,219 --> 00:01:25,830
It's been so long.

23
00:01:25,859 --> 00:01:28,910
My mommy
hasn't fallen in love with you yet.

24
00:01:29,499 --> 00:01:31,539
(It's because your mommy is difficult.)

25
00:01:31,540 --> 00:01:33,949
It's a pity that you have a face
as handsome as mine.

26
00:01:34,859 --> 00:01:36,790
(What's the use of being handsome?)

27
00:01:36,859 --> 00:01:38,459
Mr. Si, be honest.

28
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:40,910
Are you incapable of dating?

29
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:43,550
Do you want me to teach you?

30
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:45,710
(I had to be taught by children.)

31
00:01:45,820 --> 00:01:46,589
Okay.

32
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:52,509
I finally got to buy you a meal,

33
00:01:53,660 --> 00:01:54,830
yet you wanted to eat at a food stall.

34
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:58,058
What's wrong with food stalls?

35
00:01:58,059 --> 00:01:59,190
You don't know.

36
00:01:59,259 --> 00:02:01,229
If you want life to be interesting,

37
00:02:01,380 --> 00:02:03,749
you need food stalls
to build your appetite.

38
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,389
This way.

39
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:07,550
Thank you.

40
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:09,869
Here.

41
00:02:11,420 --> 00:02:12,830
Do you like Thai food?

42
00:02:14,140 --> 00:02:15,058
No.

43
00:02:15,059 --> 00:02:16,469
I think it smells weird.

44
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:19,309
Don't you think

45
00:02:19,339 --> 00:02:22,029
it has a special yet familiar smell?

46
00:02:26,860 --> 00:02:28,789
When you say so,

47
00:02:29,300 --> 00:02:33,510
it does seem a little familiar.

48
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,658
Have you remembered

49
00:02:41,659 --> 00:02:43,469
everything Mommy likes and dislikes?

50
00:02:45,539 --> 00:02:46,270
Yes.

51
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:49,218
You can ask
anything else you want to ask..

52
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:51,349
Baobei and I
will do our best to support you.

53
00:02:51,779 --> 00:02:52,179
Yes.

54
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:52,990
I have a question.

55
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:55,550
It's about Mr. X.

56
00:02:55,659 --> 00:02:56,830
Who is he?

57
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,150
Is he close with your mommy?

58
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:02,218
Yes, they're very close.

59
00:03:02,219 --> 00:03:03,550
They see each other everyday.

60
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:04,950
They see each other everyday?

61
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:07,990
Yeah, Mommy likes him.

62
00:03:11,619 --> 00:03:12,510
What about you?

63
00:03:12,819 --> 00:03:14,550
Do you have his contact information?

64
00:03:15,140 --> 00:03:16,739
Does he usually play with you like this?

65
00:03:16,740 --> 00:03:18,270
Yes.

66
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:23,179
Do you want to know how to find him?

67
00:03:23,180 --> 00:03:24,629
Your ear. Come closer.

68
00:03:25,659 --> 00:03:28,218
Pursuer X

69
00:03:28,219 --> 00:03:29,309
is Mu Xingxing.

70
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:30,550
What?

71
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:33,110
Yes, it's me.

72
00:03:37,779 --> 00:03:39,390
Do you really know how to write codes?

73
00:03:39,539 --> 00:03:40,990
Are you doubting me?

74
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:44,299
These are simple for Xingxing.

75
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,179
Mommy said

76
00:03:45,180 --> 00:03:46,579
Xingxing might have inherited

77
00:03:46,580 --> 00:03:48,218
our biological father's genes.

78
00:03:48,219 --> 00:03:49,469
He's a genius.

79
00:03:49,779 --> 00:03:51,299
If Mommy hadn't lost her memory,

80
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:53,430
we would have found
our biological father long ago.

81
00:03:54,460 --> 00:03:57,589
I guess our dad
must be handsome and smart.

82
00:03:58,499 --> 00:04:00,538
But don't worry, Mr. Si.

83
00:04:00,539 --> 00:04:02,459
Even if our biological father
comes back,

84
00:04:02,460 --> 00:04:04,139
we'll take your side.

85
00:04:04,140 --> 00:04:05,150
That's right.

86
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,338
Why?

87
00:04:07,339 --> 00:04:09,670
Because he's a jerk.

88
00:04:09,700 --> 00:04:11,938
He never found us and Mommy.

89
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:14,459
Mommy had such a hard time
giving birth to us.

90
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,499
He also let Mommy raise us alone.

91
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,858
He never bothered with my mommy,

92
00:04:17,859 --> 00:04:19,229
nor helped Mommy.

93
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:20,669
We don't miss him.

94
00:04:20,779 --> 00:04:21,379
Mr. Si.

95
00:04:21,380 --> 00:04:24,669
Can you hurry up and marry Mommy?

96
00:04:26,859 --> 00:04:29,619
Haven't I been trying?

97
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,229
Then why are you still here?

98
00:04:36,339 --> 00:04:38,059
Where should I go?

99
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,830
Find Mommy.

100
00:04:39,859 --> 00:04:41,510
She's on a business trip alone.

101
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:43,858
She must want someone to accompany her.

102
00:04:43,859 --> 00:04:45,870
You unromantic man.

103
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,390
You two

104
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:52,190
are smarter than me.

105
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:55,259
That's right.

106
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,630
Daddy and Mommy are going dating again.

107
00:05:09,620 --> 00:05:10,589
Hello? Baobei.

108
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,338
Mr. Chen.

109
00:05:11,339 --> 00:05:13,298
Mommy and Mr. Si are going on a date.

110
00:05:13,299 --> 00:05:14,619
Come and babysit us.

111
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:15,789
Now?

112
00:05:20,219 --> 00:05:21,070
Okay.

113
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,429
I'm a pitiful single man.

114
00:05:44,219 --> 00:05:45,070
Ms. Mu.

115
00:05:45,219 --> 00:05:46,469
I still want to tell you

116
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:49,070
that I want to pursue you.

117
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:53,059
Why are you so direct?

118
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:54,298
Didn't I tell you

119
00:05:54,299 --> 00:05:55,630
that we're not right for each other?

120
00:05:58,620 --> 00:05:59,750
Who's right for you then?

121
00:06:00,739 --> 00:06:01,870
Si Qingye?

122
00:06:08,779 --> 00:06:09,390
Yes.

123
00:06:11,179 --> 00:06:12,190
I like him.

124
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:17,429
When I first met him,

125
00:06:17,979 --> 00:06:19,989
I just thought he was a lunatic.

126
00:06:21,460 --> 00:06:22,510
Later,

127
00:06:23,219 --> 00:06:25,390
he said I was his ex-girlfriend.

128
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:28,469
I think his way of pursuing a girl
is too old-fashioned.

129
00:06:29,299 --> 00:06:30,830
After I slowly got to know him,

130
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:34,070
I think he's sincere,

131
00:06:34,739 --> 00:06:35,589
kind,

132
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:37,190
and responsible.

133
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:41,039
Besides that, he's a little silly.
