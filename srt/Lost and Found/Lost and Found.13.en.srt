=Episode 13=

3
00:00:18,220 --> 00:00:19,310
Ms. Mu, I'll leave first.

4
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:25,709
Mr...

5
00:00:45,220 --> 00:00:46,030
Stop.

6
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,099
You didn't answer my phone calls,
didn't reply to my Wechat messages,

7
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,110
nor open the door when I knock on it.

8
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,539
If not because you haven't resigned,

9
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,790
where can I find you?

10
00:00:54,820 --> 00:00:55,499
What do you want?

11
00:00:55,500 --> 00:00:56,309
Nothing.

12
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:57,298
I'll leave then.

13
00:00:57,299 --> 00:00:58,150
I want to talk to you.

14
00:01:01,460 --> 00:01:02,309
Sorry.

15
00:01:03,220 --> 00:01:05,309
I shouldn't have tested you repeatedly.

16
00:01:09,699 --> 00:01:11,229
What do you want?

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:15,058
I'm here to pick you up from work.

18
00:01:15,059 --> 00:01:16,299
No thanks.

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,469
It's not safe to be with you.

20
00:01:18,699 --> 00:01:20,469
You're safe with me.

21
00:01:32,660 --> 00:01:33,589
I thought it through.

22
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,270
I know you're not Ning Wuhui.

23
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:38,990
I hope you're not her too.

24
00:01:46,779 --> 00:01:48,589
Did X give you this car?

25
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,338
No, he gave you a car

26
00:01:50,339 --> 00:01:50,858
and an umbrella.

27
00:01:50,859 --> 00:01:52,229
What does he want?

28
00:01:53,020 --> 00:01:56,389
Maybe he wants to pursue me.

29
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:01,058
I can give you a car too.

30
00:02:01,059 --> 00:02:02,710
I'll drive over to buy one for you now.

31
00:02:06,699 --> 00:02:09,538
Are you jealous?

32
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:11,589
Yes, I'm jealous.

33
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,589
There's a car.

34
00:02:16,659 --> 00:02:17,378
Slow down.

35
00:02:17,379 --> 00:02:18,390
The brake failed.

36
00:02:19,219 --> 00:02:20,218
Mu Yunge, watch out!

37
00:02:20,219 --> 00:02:22,349
Si Qingye, watch out!

38
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:28,699
Hello? Boss.

39
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,589
Chen Ge,
Yunge and I were in a car accident.

40
00:02:31,339 --> 00:02:32,778
Boss, you had a car accident?

41
00:02:32,779 --> 00:02:33,579
How are you?

42
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,459
I'm fine. We just had minor injuries.

43
00:02:34,460 --> 00:02:36,069
Where are you
I'll take care of it right away.

44
00:02:36,580 --> 00:02:37,670
On Jiangbin Avenue.

45
00:02:37,779 --> 00:02:38,469
No.

46
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:42,270
My boss

47
00:02:42,539 --> 00:02:44,550
always have a hard time
getting a girlfriend.

48
00:02:49,059 --> 00:02:50,550
The brake won't fail suddenly.

49
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:52,430
Someone must have tampered with it.

50
00:02:52,939 --> 00:02:54,230
I'll investigate it.

51
00:02:57,460 --> 00:02:58,338
I won't

52
00:02:58,339 --> 00:03:00,230
let this happen again.

53
00:03:01,939 --> 00:03:03,338
I want to keep you safe.

54
00:03:03,339 --> 00:03:05,270
Don't leave my sight.

55
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,778
You...You can't risk your life

56
00:03:07,779 --> 00:03:09,110
to protect me.

57
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:11,390
I only have one idea.

58
00:03:11,539 --> 00:03:12,950
and that is to prevent you
from getting hurt.

59
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,950
Mu Yunge, I like you.

60
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,990
Be my girlfriend.

61
00:03:22,219 --> 00:03:24,749
Si Qingye, are you serious?

62
00:03:24,980 --> 00:03:26,469
I'm not Ning Wuhui.

63
00:03:26,619 --> 00:03:28,550
Of... Of course I'm serious.

64
00:03:29,059 --> 00:03:30,309
I like Mu Yunge.

65
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,378
I'll take care of Xingxing and Baobei

66
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,749
as if they're mine.

67
00:03:34,219 --> 00:03:35,309
Our kids.

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,430

What happened? My darling.

90
00:04:57,779 --> 00:04:59,218
Did you get into an accident again?

91
00:04:59,219 --> 00:05:00,699
- How many times have I told you?
- Mom.

92
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:02,499
Don't be so reckless.

93
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:04,098
Look at your face.

94
00:05:04,099 --> 00:05:05,298
My darling. Your face.

95
00:05:05,299 --> 00:05:06,939
Where? Where was it hit?

96
00:05:06,940 --> 00:05:07,499
How about this side?

97
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:07,858
- How about your neck?
- Mom.

98
00:05:07,859 --> 00:05:08,950
Let go.

99
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:09,939
I'm really okay.

100
00:05:09,940 --> 00:05:10,778
If you continue shaking me,

101
00:05:10,779 --> 00:05:11,950
I will really be uncomfortable.

102
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,178
Look.

103
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:14,579
You had such a big wound.

104
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,669
I'm fine.

105
00:05:16,099 --> 00:05:16,870
Ouch.

106
00:05:22,580 --> 00:05:23,059
Mom.

107
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:23,778
Are...

108
00:05:23,779 --> 00:05:24,830
Are you okay?

109
00:05:26,419 --> 00:05:28,229
I'm fine.

110
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:30,379
Mom, it's all right.

111
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:30,738
Come here.

112
00:05:30,739 --> 00:05:31,298
Sit. Sit here.

113
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:32,858
Did you two check out your wounds?

114
00:05:32,859 --> 00:05:33,978
Look at how serious your wounds are.

115
00:05:33,979 --> 00:05:36,029
Of course we did.

116
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:39,510
Yunge, right?

117
00:05:40,299 --> 00:05:41,109
Sit.

118
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:42,349
Okay.

119
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:43,390
I'll sit.

120
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,778
Actually,

121
00:05:49,779 --> 00:05:51,669
it's okay for a man

122
00:05:51,779 --> 00:05:54,098
to get hurt

123
00:05:54,099 --> 00:05:55,510
protecting his girlfriend, right?

124
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:58,218
But the point is

125
00:05:58,219 --> 00:06:01,029
what's going on with you two?

126
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,870
Thank you for your concern.

127
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,270
We're...

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:09,750
We're still working it out.

129
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,658
You haven't settled her?

130
00:06:13,659 --> 00:06:14,669
What are you doing?

131
00:06:15,580 --> 00:06:16,499
Soon.

132
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:17,870
- She's my girlfriend now.
- Grandma.

133
00:06:18,020 --> 00:06:19,939
- My little darlings.
- Grandma.

134
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:21,939
I missed you so much.

135
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:22,989
Great.

136
00:06:23,140 --> 00:06:24,469
Do you miss me?

137
00:06:24,580 --> 00:06:25,298
No.

138
00:06:25,299 --> 00:06:26,630
No, Xingxing, Baobei.

139
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:28,870
Do you know each other?

140
00:06:29,260 --> 00:06:30,338
Not only do we know each other,

141
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:32,738
we're good friends.

142
00:06:32,739 --> 00:06:33,819
Grandma.

143
00:06:33,820 --> 00:06:35,070
Okay, Xingxing.

144
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,858
You keep secrets from me now.

145
00:06:36,859 --> 00:06:37,589
don't you?

146
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:38,858
Yunge.

147
00:06:38,859 --> 00:06:39,858
Do you know what this is?

148
00:06:39,859 --> 00:06:41,418
It's called fate.

149
00:06:41,419 --> 00:06:42,459
Right?

150
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:43,349
Yes.

151
00:06:43,500 --> 00:06:44,218
Ye Ye.

152
00:06:44,219 --> 00:06:45,098
Today,

153
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:46,139
tell me

154
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:47,349
in front of me

155
00:06:47,460 --> 00:06:48,459
and Yunge

156
00:06:48,460 --> 00:06:50,190
if you're serious.

157
00:06:52,419 --> 00:06:53,549
Of course I'm serious.

158
00:06:53,659 --> 00:06:54,819
Since you're serious,

159
00:06:54,820 --> 00:06:56,538
you'll have to be responsible
until the end.

160
00:06:56,539 --> 00:06:57,459
Get married soon.

161
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,510
Otherwise, I'll punish you.

162
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:01,310
Yunge, sit.

163
00:07:03,460 --> 00:07:05,190
Take them shopping.

164
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:06,899
Get some rest.

165
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,469
When you recover from your injury,

166
00:07:08,779 --> 00:07:10,538
I'll take you shopping, okay?

167
00:07:10,539 --> 00:07:11,379
Okay?

168
00:07:11,380 --> 00:07:12,658
Okay.

169
00:07:12,659 --> 00:07:13,789
Thank you, Madam.

170
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:16,019
My little darlings. Let's go.

171
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:17,619
Let your mom talk to Mr. Si.

172
00:07:17,620 --> 00:07:19,070
I'll take you out.

173
00:07:20,859 --> 00:07:21,819
Slow down.

174
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:23,029
I can't keep up.

175
00:07:23,099 --> 00:07:23,909
Slow down.

176
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,349
Slow down.

177
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,029
My mom.

178
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,270
I can tell.

179
00:07:33,339 --> 00:07:36,029
My mom is kind to you.

180
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:48,139
Boss.

181
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:49,978
Someone tampered with the brake failure.

182
00:07:49,979 --> 00:07:51,178
I checked
the parking lot surveillance footage

183
00:07:51,179 --> 00:07:52,589
Someone already deleted them.

184
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:54,950
Chen Ge.

185
00:07:55,299 --> 00:07:56,510
You can tell me in my dreams

186
00:07:56,900 --> 00:07:58,310
if anything happens.

187
00:07:59,779 --> 00:08:00,178
No, Boss.

188
00:08:00,179 --> 00:08:00,950
Get out.

189
00:08:01,539 --> 00:08:02,218
This matter...

190
00:08:02,219 --> 00:08:03,270
Get out.

191
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:07,070
Okay.

192
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,150
