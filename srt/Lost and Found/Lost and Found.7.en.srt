3
00:00:16,220 --> 00:00:18,709
Let's be friends then.

4
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:19,590
Add me on Wechat.

5
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:21,160
Whose QR code shall we scan?
Let me scan yours.

6
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:25,950
Sorry, she's my wife.

7
00:00:26,380 --> 00:00:28,699
How dare you add him on Wechat and QQ?

8
00:00:28,700 --> 00:00:29,019
Let's go.

9
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:29,829
You...

10
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:32,710
Mommy.

11
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:37,499
My son's amazing.

12
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:38,859
He must have succeeded today.

13
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,618
What is this called?

14
00:00:39,619 --> 00:00:40,978
Like father, like son.

15
00:00:40,979 --> 00:00:42,378
Like mother, like daughter.

16
00:00:42,379 --> 00:00:44,179
With a mother like me,

17
00:00:44,180 --> 00:00:47,670
my son will find the best girl.

18
00:00:48,379 --> 00:00:49,110
Where did he go?

19
00:00:50,379 --> 00:00:51,110
Where did he go?

20
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:56,790
Hello?

21
00:00:57,140 --> 00:00:58,150
My dear son.

22
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:00,189
Where are you?

23
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:02,909
I don't see you.

24
00:01:03,619 --> 00:01:05,589
Are you done? Are you dating?

25
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,350
Where are you?

26
00:01:07,740 --> 00:01:09,029
Hello?

27
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,270
Hello? Mom.

28
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:12,830
Stop talking. I'm on my way home.

29
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:17,029
Here.

30
00:01:17,740 --> 00:01:18,469
Come in.

31
00:01:24,940 --> 00:01:25,749
Sit anywhere you want.

32
00:01:27,460 --> 00:01:28,710
Make yourself at home.

33
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:30,070
Sit.

34
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:34,509
Apologize to Mr. Si.

35
00:01:35,499 --> 00:01:38,070
Mr. Si, sorry.

36
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:41,229
It's all right.

37
00:01:42,059 --> 00:01:46,190
I really want you to be my dad.

38
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,350
Mu Baobei, what are you talking about?

39
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,990
I have a video game console downstairs.

40
00:01:52,059 --> 00:01:53,109
Go downstairs and play it.

41
00:01:55,499 --> 00:01:56,179
Great.

42
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,058
Great.

43
00:01:57,059 --> 00:01:57,739
Slow down.

44
00:01:57,740 --> 00:01:58,869
Got it.

45
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:03,109
Sit.

46
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:12,640
Your house is slightly bigger than mine.

47
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,550
It's all right.

48
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:18,150
Sorry.

49
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:20,430
We ruined your blind date.

50
00:02:22,460 --> 00:02:23,390
It doesn't matter.

51
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:26,990
How dare you accept my apology?

52
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,789
What's wrong?

53
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:32,218
Mr. Si, you have a fiancee and you're
still thinking about your ex-girlfriend.

54
00:02:32,219 --> 00:02:33,658
Yet you went on a blind date.

55
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:35,658
Mr. Si, don't you think

56
00:02:35,659 --> 00:02:37,110
you're quite immoral?

57
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:38,390
Fiancee?

58
00:02:38,619 --> 00:02:39,990
Since when do I have a fiancee?

59
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:41,299
Stop pretending.

60
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:43,139
Gu Xiao told me herself

61
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:46,029
that she's your fiancee.

62
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:46,830
No.

63
00:02:46,939 --> 00:02:48,589
That's nonsense.

64
00:02:48,700 --> 00:02:50,309
She's at most my subordinate.

65
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:52,019
Enough.

66
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:52,498
It's true.

67
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:53,459
Enough.

68
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:55,909
I don't want to hear your nonsense.

69
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,230
I... I have something to do tonight.

70
00:02:59,140 --> 00:03:00,270
Help me look after

71
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,749
Xingxing and Baobei.

72
00:03:04,099 --> 00:03:04,869
Well...

73
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:07,110
What is it?

74
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:09,589
Work.

75
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:11,259
I'm going to 21 Degree Bar tonight

76
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,670
to talk about Jingxiu Garden's project.

77
00:03:12,860 --> 00:03:15,270
You're a director for nothing.

78
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:16,589
But

79
00:03:16,619 --> 00:03:18,218
remove your wig.

80
00:03:18,219 --> 00:03:19,589
Don't affect my company's image.

81
00:03:32,020 --> 00:03:34,069
How do I open your stupid door?

82
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,309
It's new.

83
00:03:55,779 --> 00:03:56,629
Mr. Liu.

84
00:03:57,980 --> 00:03:58,789
You're here.

85
00:03:58,819 --> 00:04:00,309
Here. Hurry. Sit.

86
00:04:02,779 --> 00:04:05,349
This is our company's designer,
Mu Yunge.

87
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:07,979
Yunge.

88
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:10,430
This is Mr. Liu, the person in charge
of the Jingxiu Garden project.

89
00:04:10,740 --> 00:04:12,510
He admires you very much.

90
00:04:13,819 --> 00:04:15,058
It's a happy day today.

91
00:04:15,059 --> 00:04:16,870
Yunge, accompany Mr. Liu.

92
00:04:18,099 --> 00:04:18,909
Mr. Liu.

93
00:04:19,179 --> 00:04:20,978
You can talk first.
I'll go to the restroom.

94
00:04:20,979 --> 00:04:21,950
Go.

95
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:29,109
I can't cook.

96
00:04:29,419 --> 00:04:30,429
Make do with it.

97
00:04:33,620 --> 00:04:35,390
I can't believe Mr. Si.

98
00:04:35,820 --> 00:04:37,229
He doesn't know anything.

99
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:42,029
It's not easy taking care of kids.

100
00:04:45,179 --> 00:04:46,270
Where's Yunge?

101
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:54,349
Yunge.

102
00:04:54,779 --> 00:04:56,229
When are you coming back?

103
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:03,150
No, do you not respond to messages?

104
00:05:08,460 --> 00:05:09,310
Darlings.

105
00:05:09,659 --> 00:05:11,549
What time does your mommy
usually come back?

106
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,589
Hello.

107
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,538
The number you dialed
is currently unavailable.

108
00:05:25,539 --> 00:05:26,510
I can't get through to her.

109
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:34,510
Hello? Boss.

110
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:36,150
Chen Ge,
come over to babysit the kids.

111
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:38,789
Why am I babysitting again?

112
00:05:38,859 --> 00:05:39,669
No, you...

113
00:05:42,859 --> 00:05:43,778
Madam Zhang, Madam Chen.

114
00:05:43,779 --> 00:05:44,950
Have you ironed my clothes?

115
00:05:48,219 --> 00:05:49,190
Boss.

116
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:51,310
Don't you think you're out of line?

117
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:55,469
Mr. Chen Ge,
it's your turn to babysit us.

118
00:05:58,099 --> 00:05:59,150
Ms. Mu.

119
00:05:59,299 --> 00:06:00,658
Finish these three drinks,

120
00:06:00,659 --> 00:06:03,390
and we'll talk
about Jingxiu Garden's project.

121
00:06:06,859 --> 00:06:09,549
Ms. Mu, you're a good drinker.

122
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:13,190
Continue drinking.

123
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:15,349
Drink up.

124
00:06:22,859 --> 00:06:23,830
You're good at drinking.

125
00:06:26,419 --> 00:06:29,190
(Something's wrong with this liquor.)

126
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,469
Mr. Liu.

127
00:06:30,659 --> 00:06:32,789
I'm going to the restroom.

128
00:06:32,859 --> 00:06:35,229
What restroom?

129
00:06:36,580 --> 00:06:37,658
Continue drinking.

130
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,349
Well...

131
00:06:43,659 --> 00:06:44,950
Continue drinking.

132
00:06:55,820 --> 00:06:56,630
Waiter.

133
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:05,830
Where is she?

134
00:07:07,500 --> 00:07:09,349
Isn't she here?

135
00:07:10,299 --> 00:07:11,190
Idiot.

136
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,029
(Oh well.)

137
00:07:16,219 --> 00:07:17,710
(Let's see)

138
00:07:17,739 --> 00:07:19,909
(who you're sleeping with tonight
after being drugged.)

139
00:07:31,179 --> 00:07:31,989
Mu Yunge.

140
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,870
What are you doing?

141
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:34,310
Sorry.

142
00:07:47,339 --> 00:07:49,830
Do you realize it's dangerous
for a girl like you to be out here alone?

143
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:56,150
I feel awful.
