3
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,220
(Thailand)

4
00:00:23,020 --> 00:00:24,079
(Si Qingye.)

5
00:00:24,660 --> 00:00:28,200
(I'm used to betrayal.)

6
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,279
Ms. Ning Wuhui.

7
00:00:33,299 --> 00:00:34,559
Will you marry me?

8
00:00:43,019 --> 00:00:44,120
Once we get back,

9
00:00:44,699 --> 00:00:46,160
I'll propose to you officially.

10
00:00:47,259 --> 00:00:48,840
We're going to have two children.

11
00:00:49,780 --> 00:00:50,639
Then,

12
00:00:51,220 --> 00:00:52,599
I'll travel around the world with you.

13
00:00:55,299 --> 00:00:56,319
I do.

14
00:00:59,059 --> 00:00:59,959
(Wuhui)

15
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:01,359
(Promise me.)

16
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:03,800
(You will never lie to me, right?)

17
00:01:10,499 --> 00:01:11,799
(I only approached you)

18
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,559
(to complete my mission
of stealing the key.)

19
00:01:20,740 --> 00:01:21,680
(I love you)

20
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:26,760
Welcome back.

21
00:01:30,499 --> 00:01:31,600
I told you

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:33,919
not to fall for him.

23
00:01:34,139 --> 00:01:35,400
Don't kill him, okay?

24
00:01:35,740 --> 00:01:36,639
Get lost.

25
00:01:56,779 --> 00:01:57,799
(Sorry.)

26
00:01:58,859 --> 00:02:02,680
(Maybe we'll meet again.)

27
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:09,180
(Seven Years Later)

28
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:27,818
Hello, Mr. Xingxing.

29
00:02:27,819 --> 00:02:28,818
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

30
00:02:28,819 --> 00:02:29,618
Hello, Ms. Baobei.

31
00:02:29,619 --> 00:02:31,160
Hello, Mr. Zhang.

32
00:02:33,020 --> 00:02:33,919
Xingxing.

33
00:02:33,980 --> 00:02:35,179
When will Mommy

34
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:38,399
(Mu Baobei, Great-Granddaughter)
find our daddy?

35
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:41,639
(Mu Xingxing, Great-Grandson)
Mommy is almost 30 and still single.

36
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:45,658
We couldn't even
hold our heads up in kindergarten.

37
00:02:45,659 --> 00:02:47,899
Stop talking, my darlings.

38
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,079
Miss is here.

39
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,180
(Mu Yunge,
The Mu Family's Granddaughter)

40
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:02,320
Xingxing, Baobei.

41
00:03:02,379 --> 00:03:03,459
Xingxing, Baobei.

42
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:05,098
I'm meeting a friend later.

43
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:06,299
Do whatever Mr. Zhang says.

44
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,419
Good luck with your date.

45
00:03:08,420 --> 00:03:09,320
Good luck.

46
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:10,778
Mr. Zhang.

47
00:03:10,779 --> 00:03:12,320
Take the kids out to play first.

48
00:03:12,499 --> 00:03:13,320
Sure.

49
00:03:15,059 --> 00:03:15,699
Bye.

50
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,440
- Goodbye, Mommy.
- Bye

51
00:03:19,379 --> 00:03:20,959
Mommy, goodbye.

52
00:03:21,020 --> 00:03:22,119
Goodbye.

53
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,359
Remember to be good.

54
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,979
(Chen Ge
Si Group's President's Assistant)

55
00:03:36,980 --> 00:03:38,079
Ms. Mu, right?

56
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:40,440
Who are you?

57
00:03:40,539 --> 00:03:42,218
I made an appointment with you
on the phone earlier.

58
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:43,320
Please come with me.

59
00:03:44,539 --> 00:03:45,200
Let's go.

60
00:04:08,499 --> 00:04:09,498
This way, Ms. Mu.

61
00:04:09,499 --> 00:04:10,959
Mr. Si is already
waiting for you inside.

62
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:25,079
Is she the one
Mr. Si has searched for seven years?

63
00:04:28,299 --> 00:04:30,178
We've played for so long.

64
00:04:30,179 --> 00:04:32,639
Why is Mommy not back yet?

65
00:04:34,539 --> 00:04:37,000
Why don't we go find Mommy?

66
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:40,039
I have Mommy's coordinates on my watch.

67
00:04:40,260 --> 00:04:41,000
Let's go.

68
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:47,959
There are so many liquor here.

69
00:04:48,060 --> 00:04:49,619
Who asked to meet me?

70
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:51,200
What's with the mystery?

71
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:02,780
(Si Qingye
Si Group's President)

72
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,920
It's been seven years.

73
00:05:07,539 --> 00:05:09,120
We finally meet again.

74
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:25,200
Do we know each other?

75
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,959
We're more than just acquaintances.

76
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:29,839
You're quite bold.

77
00:05:31,099 --> 00:05:32,680
Since you chose to escape,

78
00:05:34,539 --> 00:05:35,839
why come back?

79
00:05:38,299 --> 00:05:42,560
But I don't know
what you're talking about.

80
00:05:59,140 --> 00:06:00,000
Have a drink.

81
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:04,599
Sir.

82
00:06:04,779 --> 00:06:05,880
I'm sorry.

83
00:06:05,900 --> 00:06:07,440
You may have mistaken me
for someone else.

84
00:06:10,700 --> 00:06:12,320
You're quite good at pretending.

85
00:06:14,539 --> 00:06:16,240
How strange.

86
00:06:23,260 --> 00:06:25,159
Thank you for the drink.
I'll leave first.

87
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:31,519
Ning Wuhui.

88
00:06:31,739 --> 00:06:32,800
It's been seven years.

89
00:06:33,620 --> 00:06:35,039
Do you not miss me at all?

90
00:06:38,539 --> 00:06:40,120
I'm going to call the police
if you continue.

91
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,719
Grab her.

92
00:06:53,779 --> 00:06:55,459
You're a lunatic.

93
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:56,579
Mommy.

94
00:06:56,580 --> 00:06:57,800
Mommy.

95
00:06:57,859 --> 00:06:58,778
Mommy.

96
00:06:58,779 --> 00:06:59,699
Mommy.

97
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:00,178
Mommy.

98
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:01,399
Why are you here?

99
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,959
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

100
00:07:04,140 --> 00:07:05,259
- Daddy.
- Daddy.

101
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,440
Daddy.

102
00:07:06,739 --> 00:07:07,719
He...

103
00:07:09,779 --> 00:07:10,920
You have kids?

104
00:07:11,539 --> 00:07:12,579
Are you married?

105
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,579
Sir.

106
00:07:13,580 --> 00:07:14,899
This is my personal business.

107
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,440
I don't think it's any of your business.

108
00:07:18,299 --> 00:07:18,939
How old are you?

109
00:07:18,940 --> 00:07:20,200
We're six years old.

110
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:22,279
Six years old?

111
00:07:25,859 --> 00:07:27,479
Xingxing, Baobei, come here.

112
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:29,939
He's not your daddy.

113
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:30,880
Hurry over.

114
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,440
Are you really not our daddy?

115
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:40,959
Am I?

116
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:44,479
He's not.

117
00:07:46,940 --> 00:07:47,899
Sir.

118
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:50,218
My name is Mu Yunge.

119
00:07:50,219 --> 00:07:52,360
I'm not the Ning Wuhui
you're looking for.

120
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:53,619
Besides,

121
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:56,279
you invited me here today.

122
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,279
Can you let us go now?

123
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:07,320
Babies, let's go home.

124
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:12,699
Let her go.

125
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,800
Yes.

126
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,560
Boss.

127
00:08:41,539 --> 00:08:43,200
Have you checked
what I asked you to check?

128
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,818
She just got back last month.

129
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:47,099
Her current identity

130
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,920
is Mr. Mu's granddaughter.

131
00:08:49,020 --> 00:08:50,280
She's currently single

132
00:08:50,299 --> 00:08:51,560
and raising her children alone.

133
00:08:51,860 --> 00:08:53,339
Mr. Mu has blocked off
all the information

134
00:08:53,340 --> 00:08:54,999
before she came back.

135
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:56,440
Continue investigating.

136
00:08:57,539 --> 00:08:58,759
And those two children

137
00:09:00,179 --> 00:09:01,479
might be mine.

138
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:03,839
Okay.

139
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,200
I'll make the arrangements now.

these seven years?)

143
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:34,359
