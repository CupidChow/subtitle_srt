=Episode 5=

3
00:00:16,459 --> 00:00:18,279
Baobei, Xingxing.

4
00:00:18,619 --> 00:00:21,520
What do you two think of Mr. Si?

5
00:00:21,739 --> 00:00:24,179
Great Grandpa, I like Mr. Si.

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:26,200
I want him to be Daddy.

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,978
But they always argue
when they see each other.

8
00:00:28,979 --> 00:00:30,019
We can't have that.

9
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:31,578
What's wrong with arguing?

10
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:33,800
In a relationship,
the more you argue, the better.

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,319
You really do keep up with the times.

12
00:00:39,659 --> 00:00:41,539
What are we having for dinner tonight?

13
00:00:41,540 --> 00:00:43,840
Snow clams cooked in bird's nest
and bluefin tuna.

14
00:00:45,379 --> 00:00:46,120
Okay.

15
00:00:46,659 --> 00:00:47,800
Get ready.

16
00:00:47,860 --> 00:00:50,319
We'll be having some good food later.

17
00:00:58,420 --> 00:00:59,779
Are you Mu Yunge?

18
00:00:59,780 --> 00:01:00,978
What does it have to do with you

19
00:01:00,979 --> 00:01:02,279
whether I'm Mu Yunge?

20
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:04,080
Get her.

21
00:01:17,699 --> 00:01:19,179
I'll ask you one last time.

22
00:01:19,180 --> 00:01:20,600
Are you Mu Yunge?

23
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,200
I'm Mu Yunge.

24
00:01:26,059 --> 00:01:27,258
You, get her.

25
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:28,680
Watch me kill you.

26
00:01:33,339 --> 00:01:35,439
Tell me who sent you.

27
00:01:37,660 --> 00:01:38,480
Who was it?

28
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:41,138
Mu Yaner sent us here.

29
00:01:41,139 --> 00:01:42,680
Mu Yaner?

30
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:55,680
How dare you hit my buddy?
Watch me kill you.

31
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,040
Why is she grappling them?

32
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:02,418
Let's go.

33
00:02:02,419 --> 00:02:03,999
You guys. I...

34
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:17,639
You're a dangerous woman.

35
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:20,280
Why are you grabbing me?

36
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:22,919
You...

37
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,359
Si...

38
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,200
You...

39
00:02:26,939 --> 00:02:28,440
Do you remember something?

40
00:02:28,779 --> 00:02:30,480
Ning Wuhui is best at martial arts.

41
00:02:31,099 --> 00:02:33,658
I learned it in self-defense class.
I only know a few moves.

42
00:02:33,659 --> 00:02:34,639
Keep making it up.

43
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,839
Tell the truth.

44
00:02:36,219 --> 00:02:37,419
Let go.

45
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,259
Let go.

46
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,160
You...

47
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:41,218
You're grabbing... Let go.

48
00:02:41,219 --> 00:02:43,079
- Are you going to tell me?
- Enough.

49
00:02:44,059 --> 00:02:48,200
Mr. Si, you and Mommy make a good match.

50
00:02:48,539 --> 00:02:49,579
A good match?

51
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:51,459
Why do I feel like they're both angry

52
00:02:51,460 --> 00:02:52,699
and want to kill each other?

53
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:54,139
You don't understand.

54
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:56,218
It's always like that on TV.

55
00:02:56,219 --> 00:02:58,139
The men and women will fight

56
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,859
and argue and then become a couple.

57
00:03:00,860 --> 00:03:02,139
I'm officially announcing

58
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:05,160
that I'm going to work hard
to make Mr. Si our dad.

59
00:03:05,619 --> 00:03:07,280
Baobei, don't talk nonsense.

60
00:03:09,939 --> 00:03:12,359
Boss,
we found the mastermind behind this.

61
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:13,600
Mu Yaner sent them.

62
00:03:14,740 --> 00:03:15,600
Got it.

63
00:03:17,619 --> 00:03:18,399
No.

64
00:03:19,180 --> 00:03:20,639
No, you found out too.

65
00:03:21,339 --> 00:03:22,280
Of course.

66
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:23,799
Ms. Mu.

67
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,179
Could you be a little less impulsive

68
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,119
next time you're in danger?

69
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:29,579
Please keep me safe

70
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:30,899
while you send me

71
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,179
to and from work.

72
00:03:32,180 --> 00:03:33,760
Don't let me get frightened again.

73
00:03:34,300 --> 00:03:35,040
I...

74
00:03:42,219 --> 00:03:42,959
Come here.

75
00:03:43,819 --> 00:03:44,799
Mommy.

76
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,799
Boss, we...

77
00:03:53,539 --> 00:03:54,399
Okay.

78
00:03:54,860 --> 00:03:55,600
I'll leave.

79
00:04:21,580 --> 00:04:22,298
Hello?

80
00:04:22,299 --> 00:04:23,440
Hello? Ms. Mu.

81
00:04:23,539 --> 00:04:24,819
We failed.

82
00:04:24,820 --> 00:04:25,899
Idiots.

83
00:04:25,900 --> 00:04:27,479
You can't even handle such a small task.

84
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:30,279
Sooner or later, I'm going to throw her
into the sea to feed the fish.

85
00:04:34,299 --> 00:04:35,839
Mu Yunge.

86
00:04:39,219 --> 00:04:41,298
I'm lucky to have you, Baobei.

87
00:04:41,299 --> 00:04:43,959
I'll take care of your beauty.

88
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,880
By the way, Baobei,

89
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:49,298
Don't get too close to Si Qingye.

90
00:04:49,299 --> 00:04:50,399
Why?

91
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:54,579
Because he's moody,

92
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,738
unpredictable,

93
00:04:55,739 --> 00:04:56,858
and has a tendency to violence.

94
00:04:56,859 --> 00:04:58,000
He's scary.

95
00:04:58,260 --> 00:04:59,338
Is he scary?

96
00:04:59,339 --> 00:05:00,920
Super scary.

97
00:05:18,979 --> 00:05:19,839
Hello.

98
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:27,639
Hello, Ms. Mu.

99
00:05:27,659 --> 00:05:28,719
I'm Gu Xiao.

100
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:29,778
Gu Xiao?

101
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:31,560
I think I've seen you at work.

102
00:05:31,739 --> 00:05:32,459
Please enjoy.

103
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:33,279
Thank you.

104
00:05:36,219 --> 00:05:37,778
I invited you here today

105
00:05:37,779 --> 00:05:39,320
to ask you a favor.

106
00:05:40,179 --> 00:05:41,079
Go ahead.

107
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:44,200
Please stay away from Si Qingye.

108
00:05:47,219 --> 00:05:49,839
Is that why you invited me here?

109
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,320
I've known Ye for over ten years.

110
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:55,279
I know him

111
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,760
best.

112
00:05:56,900 --> 00:05:58,479
I don't think
you're right for each other.

113
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,200
Have some self-respect.

114
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:02,959
Ms. Gu.

115
00:06:03,099 --> 00:06:05,639
Who are you talking to me as?

116
00:06:10,219 --> 00:06:12,178
I'm talking to you

117
00:06:12,179 --> 00:06:13,320
as Mr. Si's fiancee.

118
00:06:17,140 --> 00:06:18,880
If that's the case,

119
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:20,279
Ms. Gu,

120
00:06:21,179 --> 00:06:23,479
this is between the two of you.

121
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:25,839
You should talk to Mr. Si.

122
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:38,579
(Mu Yunge.)

123
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:40,218
(You're really charming.)

124
00:06:40,219 --> 00:06:41,298
(It's been seven years.)

125
00:06:41,299 --> 00:06:44,200
(Si Qingye is still in love with you.)

126
00:06:45,179 --> 00:06:45,899
Miss.

127
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:48,000
Please have a look at this new model.

128
00:06:48,099 --> 00:06:49,338
It's made in the United Kingdom.

129
00:06:49,339 --> 00:06:51,418
It starts from as low as 1.2 million,

130
00:06:51,419 --> 00:06:52,839
but your fondness is priceless.

131
00:06:53,339 --> 00:06:55,159
Babies, take a look.

132
00:06:55,580 --> 00:06:57,479
What a beautiful car.
This one suits you.

133
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,159
This yellow one is nice.

134
00:07:00,219 --> 00:07:02,399
I still think
the one earlier was better.

135
00:07:02,779 --> 00:07:03,699
Right, Baby?

136
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,719
Mommy.

137
00:07:07,140 --> 00:07:08,399
Madam Mu, Ms. Mu.

138
00:07:08,900 --> 00:07:09,920
Welcome.

139
00:07:09,979 --> 00:07:12,360
Take a look. Our new model is over here.

140
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,479
Yunge.

141
00:07:17,179 --> 00:07:18,098
I didn't expect...

142
00:07:18,099 --> 00:07:18,778
Auntie.

143
00:07:18,779 --> 00:07:20,639
...to run into you here.

144
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:22,599
Mom.

145
00:07:22,820 --> 00:07:24,880
This shop isn't very classy.

146
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,039
Let's go to another shop
to look at the cars.

147
00:07:28,979 --> 00:07:31,959
I didn't check the Imperial Calendar
before going out. How unlucky.

148
00:07:32,179 --> 00:07:34,218
And you said
you didn't want Grandpa's fortune.

149
00:07:34,219 --> 00:07:36,000
You've only been home a few days

150
00:07:36,179 --> 00:07:37,839
and you're already buying a car
with his money.

151
00:07:38,099 --> 00:07:40,538
Did the manure tanker pass by your house

152
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:42,000
and you want to have a taste?

153
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,719
Mom, look at her.

154
00:07:47,539 --> 00:07:48,599
Yunge.

155
00:07:48,739 --> 00:07:50,800
We can't let Mom
get bullied by bad people.

156
00:07:51,219 --> 00:07:52,079
Yes.

157
00:07:53,779 --> 00:07:54,599
I'm all right.

158
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,000
Thank you for your concern.

159
00:07:57,779 --> 00:08:00,538
I heard you had a hard time abroad.

160
00:08:00,539 --> 00:08:02,098
If you ever need money,

161
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:03,259
let me know.

162
00:08:03,260 --> 00:08:05,839
It's not good
to always worry Grandpa, right?

163
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:07,560
Okay.

164
00:08:07,979 --> 00:08:10,760
Could you buy this car for me?

165
00:08:13,299 --> 00:08:14,800
Kids, come here.

166
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:16,059
Thank Grand-aunt.

167
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:17,680
Thank you, Grand-aunt.

168
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:18,800
Don't mention it.

169
00:08:19,179 --> 00:08:21,139
Mu Yunge, do you have any shame?

170
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,159
I gave you a chance,
and you really took advantage of it.

171
00:08:23,859 --> 00:08:24,899
If you don't want your mouth,

172
00:08:24,900 --> 00:08:26,639
I can sew it up for you.

173
00:08:26,779 --> 00:08:27,699
Guess

174
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:29,019
what will happen if I told Grandpa

175
00:08:29,020 --> 00:08:30,639
that you sent someone to attack me?

176
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,520
What?

177
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:34,839
Do you have proof?

178
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:41,178
Let him go.

179
00:08:41,179 --> 00:08:42,578
Mu Yaner sent us here.

180
00:08:42,579 --> 00:08:43,680
Yes.

181
00:08:45,459 --> 00:08:46,719
Don't send it.

182
00:08:47,659 --> 00:08:48,640
Don't worry.

183
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:50,239
I won't tell Grandpa.

184
00:08:50,939 --> 00:08:52,680
What happens next

185
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:54,040
depends on your behavior.

186
00:08:55,419 --> 00:08:56,458
Calm down.

187
00:08:56,459 --> 00:08:57,058
Be good.

188
00:08:57,059 --> 00:08:57,658
Be good.

189
00:08:57,659 --> 00:08:58,099
Stop!

190
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,959
Don't.

191
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,920
Mr. Si, you really came.

192
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,599
Ms. Mu, you have such a bad temper.

193
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,979
Looks like you didn't remember
my warning to you

194
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:09,079
last time.

195
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:11,920
Mr. Si, what a coincidence.

196
00:09:11,939 --> 00:09:13,560
Are you here to check out some cars too?

197
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:15,079
It's not a coincidence.

198
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:19,280
I came here on purpose.

199
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:20,538
Mommy.

200
00:09:20,539 --> 00:09:22,698
I called Mr. Si

201
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,339
to capture the bad woman.

202
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,680
Who are you calling a bad woman?

203
00:09:25,699 --> 00:09:26,538
Mr. Si.

204
00:09:26,539 --> 00:09:28,099
Why do you keep defending

205
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,379
Mu Yunge?

206
00:09:29,380 --> 00:09:30,920
There aren't that many reasons.

207
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,640
Madam Mu.

208
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:34,759
Have you forgotten my rules?

209
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,320
Mr. Si.

210
00:09:36,340 --> 00:09:38,658
Yaner is young and doesn't understand.

211
00:09:38,659 --> 00:09:40,680
Be the bigger person.

212
00:09:45,059 --> 00:09:45,920
Wait for me.

213
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,680
Wait for me.

214
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:51,479
Mr. Si, you're amazing.

215
00:09:51,659 --> 00:09:53,359
Mr. Si, you're mighty.

216
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:54,560
How obedient.

217
00:09:58,620 --> 00:09:59,320
Let's go.

218
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:03,599
Baobei.

219
00:10:03,900 --> 00:10:06,239
Will you stop bothering Mr. Si?

220
00:10:08,819 --> 00:10:09,759
It doesn't matter.

221
00:10:12,059 --> 00:10:12,578
I don't mind.

222
00:10:12,579 --> 00:10:13,979
Mr. Si is so handsome.

223
00:10:13,980 --> 00:10:14,879
Yeah.

224
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,458
Ms. Mu.

225
00:10:19,459 --> 00:10:20,938
A mysterious customer

226
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:22,778
has ordered
a limited edition model for you.

227
00:10:22,779 --> 00:10:24,119
Please sign it.

228
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:25,879
What?

229
00:10:26,260 --> 00:10:28,759
It's a gentleman
who called himself Pursuer X.
