=Episode 6=

3
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:19,019
Ms. Mu.

4
00:00:19,020 --> 00:00:20,499
A mysterious customer

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:22,339
has ordered
a limited edition model for you.

6
00:00:22,340 --> 00:00:23,680
Please sign it.

7
00:00:24,459 --> 00:00:25,439
What?

8
00:00:25,820 --> 00:00:28,320
It's a gentleman
who called himself Pursuer X.

9
00:00:34,420 --> 00:00:35,720
What Mr. X?

10
00:00:36,339 --> 00:00:37,120
Who is that?

11
00:00:38,780 --> 00:00:39,419
Mommy.

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:40,739
Didn't you have many men pursuing you

13
00:00:40,740 --> 00:00:42,779
when you were abroad?

14
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,800
Maybe it's one of them.

15
00:00:47,180 --> 00:00:49,618
Mr. Si, you better hurry up.

16
00:00:49,619 --> 00:00:52,080
My mommy is popular.

17
00:00:52,979 --> 00:00:53,840
You can't take it.

18
00:00:56,019 --> 00:00:58,239
Please tell him I don't need it.

19
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:02,499
Mommy, take it.

20
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:03,919
I bought it.

21
00:01:04,380 --> 00:01:05,299
Nonsense.

22
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:07,618
Did you know
that I make money writing code?

23
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,120
I'm good.

24
00:01:09,499 --> 00:01:11,120
Really?

25
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:15,760
Take it.

26
00:01:17,219 --> 00:01:18,760
I'll take it

27
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:19,819
then.

28
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:20,799
Okay.

29
00:01:26,979 --> 00:01:27,999
No, Mu Yunge.

30
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,418
This...

31
00:01:29,419 --> 00:01:31,058
You don't even know
which man gave it to you.

32
00:01:31,059 --> 00:01:32,439
Are you just going to take it?

33
00:01:33,779 --> 00:01:34,559
What's the matter?

34
00:01:35,139 --> 00:01:36,559
Are you envious of me, Mr. Si?

35
00:01:39,460 --> 00:01:41,559
I know

36
00:01:41,740 --> 00:01:42,880
Pursuer X.

37
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:45,320
I like him very much.

38
00:01:51,419 --> 00:01:52,840
Baobei, Xingxing.

39
00:01:53,460 --> 00:01:54,480
Contact me

40
00:01:54,940 --> 00:01:55,999
if you need anything.

41
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:56,978
Okay.

42
00:01:56,979 --> 00:01:58,159
Okay.

43
00:02:02,499 --> 00:02:05,559
What the heck? He's so rude.

44
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:06,719
Does he have any manners?

45
00:02:07,580 --> 00:02:09,778
Mommy, looks like Mr. Si...

46
00:02:09,779 --> 00:02:12,538
Mr. Si is jealous.

47
00:02:12,539 --> 00:02:13,880
Jealous?

48
00:02:14,300 --> 00:02:15,959
So what if he's jealous?

49
00:02:16,140 --> 00:02:19,000
He has no son.

50
00:02:20,420 --> 00:02:21,658
My darling son.

51
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,919
I now have financial freedom
because of you.

52
00:02:25,539 --> 00:02:26,519
Let's go, kids.

53
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:28,859
Let's collect our new car and go home.

54
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:29,799
This way, please.

55
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:31,200
Let's go.

56
00:02:34,180 --> 00:02:35,280
Let's go.

57
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:40,699
Investigate

58
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,040
who bought Mu Yunge the car.

59
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:42,959
Okay.

60
00:02:46,779 --> 00:02:47,639
Mom.

61
00:02:49,819 --> 00:02:51,200
Do you not knock before coming in?

62
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:55,778
(Dong Moli
Si Group's President's Mother)

63
00:02:55,779 --> 00:02:56,839
I disagree.

64
00:02:58,339 --> 00:02:59,179
I disagree.

65
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:00,618
I disagree you and that...

66
00:03:00,619 --> 00:03:01,880
What's her name?

67
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:02,859
Mu Yunge.

68
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:03,579
Mu Yunge.

69
00:03:03,580 --> 00:03:05,058
I'm telling you I disagree, okay?

70
00:03:05,059 --> 00:03:06,538
Did a donkey kick you in the head?

71
00:03:06,539 --> 00:03:07,699
Or did it get caught in the door?

72
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,299
Should I check your eyes or brain?

73
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:11,000
Or something's wrong with you?

74
00:03:11,379 --> 00:03:12,480
No.

75
00:03:12,619 --> 00:03:13,699
Anyway, I don't care.

76
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:14,498
I'm telling you.

77
00:03:14,499 --> 00:03:15,098
I

78
00:03:15,099 --> 00:03:17,179
heard you took a girl to buy a car

79
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:18,459
and was so elated.

80
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,498
Darn it, I asked and found out

81
00:03:20,499 --> 00:03:22,538
she's a mother of two.

82
00:03:22,539 --> 00:03:23,720
So what?

83
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,280
You worry too much.

84
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:26,959
I worry too much?

85
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,419
If I don't worry about you,

86
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:32,440
you'll become someone else's male nanny!

87
00:03:36,659 --> 00:03:37,519
You're exaggerating.

88
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,579
After your dad died, I thought

89
00:03:42,580 --> 00:03:44,019
you could find a nice girl,

90
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,139
get married,

91
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:47,098
and live a happy life.

92
00:03:47,099 --> 00:03:48,338
but it's been years.

93
00:03:48,339 --> 00:03:49,699
My dear son.

94
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:49,979
Mom.

95
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:52,979
You don't even have a girl by your side.

96
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,839
Mom.

97
00:03:55,219 --> 00:03:56,160
Stop pretending.

98
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:01,399
I can stop crying,

99
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:02,839
but

100
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,720
you have to promise me one condition.

101
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:06,600
Go on.

102
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:08,699
Go on blind dates.

103
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:09,440
No.

104
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:10,299
Go.

105
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,160
No.

106
00:04:11,219 --> 00:04:12,979
Why not?

107
00:04:12,980 --> 00:04:13,739
Darling.

108
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:14,618
I heard this girl

109
00:04:14,619 --> 00:04:16,699
looks a lot
like the one from seven years ago.

110
00:04:16,700 --> 00:04:19,778
Mr. Si, my mommy
has a blind date this afternoon.

111
00:04:19,779 --> 00:04:21,259
Great Grandpa asked her to go.

112
00:04:21,260 --> 00:04:24,000
Mr. Si, you'll have to hurry.

113
00:04:24,140 --> 00:04:27,120
Or other bad men will steal Mommy.

114
00:04:27,299 --> 00:04:27,658
Goodbye.

115
00:04:27,659 --> 00:04:28,939
If she doesn't look like her,
I'll find you another...

116
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:29,778
I'll go.

117
00:04:29,779 --> 00:04:30,959
You'll go.

118
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,760
You'll go?

119
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:33,778
I'll go.

120
00:04:33,779 --> 00:04:34,719
Go then.

121
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,639
Go.

122
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:40,159
Let's go.

123
00:04:50,179 --> 00:04:51,360
I'll go too.

124
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,259
What does his marriage
have to do with me?

125
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:56,499
Surely nothing.
So why should I worry about him?

126
00:04:56,500 --> 00:04:58,400
I'm his mom. Who's going to
worry about him if not me?

127
00:04:58,419 --> 00:04:59,738
I'm old now.

128
00:04:59,739 --> 00:05:01,579
How is it my business
whether he gets married?

129
00:05:01,580 --> 00:05:03,719
What does it have to do with me
if I leave him alone?

130
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:06,899
Kids.

131
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,399
What did you call me? Lady?

132
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,880
What did you call me? Lady?

133
00:05:13,020 --> 00:05:13,538
I'm

134
00:05:13,539 --> 00:05:16,379
old enough to be your grandma.

135
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:18,079
Hello, Pretty Grandma.

136
00:05:19,140 --> 00:05:21,599
Why do I like being called Grandma?

137
00:05:22,099 --> 00:05:22,778
Again.

138
00:05:22,779 --> 00:05:24,459
Hello, Pretty Grandma.

139
00:05:24,460 --> 00:05:25,778
Pretty Grandma.

140
00:05:25,779 --> 00:05:28,538
Great.

141
00:05:28,539 --> 00:05:30,379
Kids, shall I treat you to...

142
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:32,019
Grandma, this is your seat.

143
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:33,959
It's appropriate for you
to call me grandma.

144
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:37,320
Wait for me.

145
00:05:37,460 --> 00:05:38,098
Two glasses.

146
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,120
Okay, please enjoy.

147
00:06:04,700 --> 00:06:06,760
(What is Si Qingye doing here?)

148
00:06:10,659 --> 00:06:11,880
Hello.

149
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,819
Hi.

150
00:06:12,820 --> 00:06:13,959
Hi.

151
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,719
Today is the first time
I go on a blind date.

152
00:06:18,859 --> 00:06:21,200
This is my 800th blind date.

153
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,379
Really?

154
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:22,819
Yes.

155
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,200
Your skin looks good.

156
00:06:25,200 --> 00:06:27,379
- How do you usually take care of it?
- Keep on pretending.

157
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:28,139
Really?

158
00:06:28,140 --> 00:06:31,440
I did lifting,
hyaluronic acid injections,

159
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:33,360
and laser treatments.

160
00:06:33,940 --> 00:06:35,440
Have you ever tried Thermage?

161
00:06:35,859 --> 00:06:36,819
I want to try it.

162
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,338
I don't know if it works well.

163
00:06:38,339 --> 00:06:39,379
It works pretty well.

164
00:06:39,380 --> 00:06:40,778
What do you think of my skin?

165
00:06:40,779 --> 00:06:42,978
You can't tell I have two kids, right?

166
00:06:42,979 --> 00:06:44,819
Really? I can't tell at all.

167
00:06:44,820 --> 00:06:45,658
Right?

168
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,019
Yes.

169
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:48,218
Does this look today suit me?

170
00:06:48,219 --> 00:06:50,200
I dressed up like this
for this blind date.

171
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,298
It's fashionable.

172
00:06:53,299 --> 00:06:54,560
You're good-looking.

173
00:06:55,079 --> 00:06:56,120
Thank you for your compliment.

174
00:06:56,779 --> 00:06:59,560
Your lips are plump.

175
00:06:59,620 --> 00:07:02,200
What lip gloss are you using?

176
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:06,599
This is the one i use.

177
00:07:06,679 --> 00:07:08,139
I just bought this.
It has a new packaging.

178
00:07:08,140 --> 00:07:09,178
Let me use it.

179
00:07:09,179 --> 00:07:09,499
Sure.

180
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:11,200
Apply it for me.

181
00:07:12,500 --> 00:07:13,159
Here.

182
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:22,978
Do you have any lipstick?

183
00:07:22,979 --> 00:07:23,978
Yes. What's the matter?

184
00:07:23,979 --> 00:07:26,519
Your lips don't look good today.
Let me help you put on some lipstick.

185
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:28,519
Sure.

186
00:07:31,859 --> 00:07:33,120
I'm the best at this.

187
00:07:54,859 --> 00:07:57,019
Go on.

188
00:07:57,020 --> 00:07:58,000
Go on.

189
00:07:59,260 --> 00:08:00,039
All done.

190
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,079
What do you think? Am I pretty?

191
00:08:07,179 --> 00:08:08,200
How pretty.

192
00:08:12,299 --> 00:08:13,338
