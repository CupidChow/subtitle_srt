=Episode 21=

3
00:00:31,060 --> 00:00:31,910
Mr. Lu.

4
00:00:32,100 --> 00:00:33,710
Our distribution channels
are being checked.

5
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:35,949
Si Qingye didn't act
according to our plan.

6
00:00:36,259 --> 00:00:38,309
He also found out about our deal with K.

7
00:00:38,659 --> 00:00:40,150
The police seems to be have targeted us.

8
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,710
Si Qingye should have
teamed up with the police long ago.

9
00:00:43,299 --> 00:00:44,390
We don't have much time.

10
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:45,909
We have to leave the country quickly.

11
00:00:54,900 --> 00:00:56,470
Before we leave,

12
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:01,949
I want to marry my bride.

13
00:01:45,419 --> 00:01:46,469
Hello, Grandpa?

14
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:48,379
Have Xingxing and Baobei

15
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:49,790
been obedient at your place these days?

16
00:01:50,300 --> 00:01:53,309
Don't worry.
They're well-behaved and obedient.

17
00:01:53,619 --> 00:01:56,058
Ask Xingxing and Baobei
to go to bed early.

18
00:01:56,059 --> 00:01:57,509
I'll pick them up on the weekend.

19
00:01:57,699 --> 00:01:59,338
You and Si

20
00:01:59,339 --> 00:02:00,710
haven't made up yet?

21
00:02:01,540 --> 00:02:03,229
Grandpa.

22
00:02:04,139 --> 00:02:05,910
Okay, I'll stop asking.

23
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,710
I'll stop bothering you. Bye.

24
00:02:08,099 --> 00:02:08,830
Okay.

25
00:02:26,659 --> 00:02:27,830
Long time no see.

26
00:02:47,900 --> 00:02:49,830
Boss, we've found out everything.

27
00:02:49,939 --> 00:02:52,139
Ms. Mu's car accident and the theft
of the secret key seven years ago

28
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,390
were all related to Gu Xiao.

29
00:02:57,980 --> 00:02:58,990
Inform the police.

30
00:02:59,140 --> 00:02:59,830
Okay.

31
00:03:06,619 --> 00:03:07,459
Ms. Gu.

32
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:08,459
Mr. Si has investigated thoroughly

33
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:10,110
everything you did.

34
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:12,670
The police
are waiting for you outside.

35
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:15,430
Where's Ye? I want to see Ye.

36
00:03:15,779 --> 00:03:17,629
Ms. Gu,
Mr. Si doesn't want to see you.

37
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:18,830
You're on your own.

38
00:03:19,339 --> 00:03:21,830
He won't even see me one last time?

39
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,650
(My Queen)

40
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:36,109
(Mu Yunge.)

41
00:04:36,580 --> 00:04:38,070
(Are you never finding me)

42
00:04:38,260 --> 00:04:39,989
(if I don't find you?)

43
00:04:40,419 --> 00:04:41,390
(Am I)

44
00:04:41,859 --> 00:04:43,029
(the only one)

45
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:45,029
(who can't let go?)

46
00:04:47,419 --> 00:04:48,190
Boss.

47
00:04:49,979 --> 00:04:52,229
Boss, call her if you want to.

48
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,218
Nothing's going to happen
if you sit here.

49
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:56,178
If I were you,
I would have been by her side by now.

50
00:04:56,179 --> 00:04:57,789
I wouldn't be sitting here.

51
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,379
I...

52
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,029
When did you become so talkative?

53
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,549
I'm just worried about you.

54
00:05:09,739 --> 00:05:10,669
I'll make a call then.

55
00:05:11,219 --> 00:05:12,029
Okay.

56
00:05:18,539 --> 00:05:19,229
You can make the call.

57
00:05:19,979 --> 00:05:21,109
Okay, I'll do it.

58
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,789
Why can't I get through?

59
00:05:56,219 --> 00:05:56,950
Mom.

60
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:01,109
Xingxing and Baobei
are next to you, right?

61
00:06:01,460 --> 00:06:02,229
Yes.

62
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:05,579
Where's Yunge? Is she there too?

63
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:06,750
What do you think?

64
00:06:07,219 --> 00:06:08,658
How many days has it been?

65
00:06:08,659 --> 00:06:09,789
I'm telling you.

66
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:11,379
If you lose my daughter-in-law,

67
00:06:11,380 --> 00:06:12,619
I won't spare you.

68
00:06:12,620 --> 00:06:13,259
No.

69
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:14,469
Stop contacting me.

70
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:15,469
Hurry and find her.

71
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,909
Baobei, Xingxing.

72
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,630
