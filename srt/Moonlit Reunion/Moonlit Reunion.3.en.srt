00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
Episode 3

2
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:36,680
Eh!

3
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,320
Why don't I give you a tip?

4
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,640
I heard that Yuzhen Pavilion

5
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,280
also sells aphrodisiac incense.

6
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,760
Why don't you buy some?

7
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,480
He's so pretentious.

8
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:49,240
These lowlifes

9
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,960
love to bully the weak.

10
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,000
Wu Zhen?

11
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:02,160
What are you doing?

12
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,960
It has been a few days. I've missed you.

13
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,360
Come test new fragrances with me.

14
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,120
Is this how you invite someone?

15
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:11,120
You doused me in it!

16
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:13,280
This is Ling Xiao's new fragrance dew.

17
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,080
It's said that mixing it with water
can calm one's mind.

18
00:02:17,640 --> 00:02:19,880
All the better, since I won't come down.

19
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:25,280
Lady Wu, you have humiliated me.

20
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,040
You must still be in love with him!

21
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:29,800
No.

22
00:02:29,880 --> 00:02:31,040
I just…

23
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,920
wanted to humiliate you.

24
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,040
- You--
- Mr. Xie, you call yourself a scholar.

25
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:39,800
But first, you do not teach others.

26
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,520
Second,
you don't help the people.

27
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,520
Third, you are not chivalrous.

28
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,160
Fourth, you don't help the poor.

29
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:47,560
You always use your family's name.

30
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:50,680
You only care to indulge in women.

31
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:54,000
I am known for my mischief.

32
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:55,640
I accept my ill repute.

33
00:02:56,040 --> 00:02:58,080
But if you admire me for my good looks,

34
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,600
I'll look down on you.

35
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,240
- You--
- Me? What about me?

36
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,000
- Mr. Ling Xiao.
- Eh!

37
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:08,840
Put Mr. Xie's fragrance on my tab.

38
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:10,080
Sure.

39
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,080
I don't want word to get out

40
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:14,480
that Mr. Xie's family
cut off his allowance

41
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:16,560
and can't afford to pay you.

42
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:19,680
Wh-- Who needs you to pay?

43
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,640
Is there no need?

44
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,680
Pay for it yourself then.

45
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:28,320
Pay for it yourself.

46
00:03:29,080 --> 00:03:30,080
Pay for it.

47
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,000
Don't take it to heart.

48
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:50,880
Wu Zhen has always liked
to play music with male prostitutes.

49
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:52,400
This isn't the first time.

50
00:03:52,800 --> 00:03:55,440
Little Zhuyu, do you know why Wu Zhen

51
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,800
always breaks the rules
and is always out of line?

52
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:02,760
This has to do
with the incident 18 years ago.

53
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:07,320
Have you heard
of the Heavenly Fire Disaster?

54
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,280
Yes.

55
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,480
That night,
the Wu sisters were out traveling.

56
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:14,440
But Wu Zhen got lost.

57
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:17,400
She was found unconscious,

58
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:19,200
remaining so for three months.

59
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,520
The Wu family had already made
the funeral arrangements.

60
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,720
But then…

61
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,120
She just woke up?

62
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:17,880
- That's right.
- Then what happened?

63
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:19,960
She changed drastically.

64
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:24,000
The Wu family,
seeing that their daughter had recovered,

65
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,200
doted on her.

66
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,440
In all of Chang'an,

67
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,840
only her sister dares to lecture her.

68
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,280
No one dares to offend her.

69
00:05:34,840 --> 00:05:36,080
That's why

70
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,640
I've been thinking about it.

71
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:38,960
Let me warn you.

72
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,240
Don't offend Wu Zhen.

73
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:41,560
You can't afford to.

74
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:46,880
There's one more thing.

75
00:05:47,640 --> 00:05:49,400
My wife's father,

76
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,720
the newly-appointed Minister Liu,
has a celebration in a few days.

77
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:54,920
All guests will be prestigious
and influential.

78
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,480
My father wants you
to represent the Mei family.

79
00:05:57,560 --> 00:05:59,040
Go and broaden your horizons.

80
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,040
Forget it. I have something
more important to do.

81
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:05,280
What is it?

82
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:10,200
I heard that the Bat Demon
caused a ruckus a few days ago

83
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:12,120
because of the Bone Relic.

84
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,240
Shu is searching for it now.

85
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:17,760
I'm sure he'll find it soon.

86
00:06:24,480 --> 00:06:25,480
Here it is.

87
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,760
Strange phenomena occurred
at the jewelry shop at night.

88
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,360
It could be the Bone Relic.
It should be investigated.

89
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:35,480
Who are you?

90
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:37,640
Mei Zhuyu of the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations.

91
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,840
I overheard you speaking
with Commander Xu.

92
00:06:42,120 --> 00:06:44,080
Can you tell me the details?

93
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,960
This is what happened.

94
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:47,360
I was sleeping at night.

95
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,320
Suddenly, I heard a voice.

96
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,920
The monster always appears after sunset.

97
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,480
Why don't you come at night?

98
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,160
All right.

99
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:06,960
- It's getting late. I should go.
- Huh?

100
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:22,360
The sun is setting. I should go.

101
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,400
You've been a good host.

102
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,600
<i>Where did the Bone Relic go?</i>

103
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:14,240
Sir, why don't you enter?

104
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:15,440
I don't dare to.

105
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:17,800
Hmm.

106
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,040
<i>Bureau of Mystic Investigations sent him?</i>

107
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:37,400
Who is it?

108
00:10:03,840 --> 00:10:04,840
Are you all right?

109
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,960
I was attacked by a demon!

110
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:08,480
I'm injured!

111
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:17,240
Was it a cat just now?

112
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,280
A cat?

113
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:22,680
Did the demon escape?

114
00:10:23,560 --> 00:10:25,600
That's a relief.

115
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:28,400
Sir, my treasures!

116
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,280
My room is full of treasures.
Did you touch any?

117
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:33,440
I mean no offense.

118
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,400
These are all precious.
I fear you can't afford to pay.

119
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,280
See if anything valuable is damaged.

120
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:44,640
This lantern is a gift
for Minister Liu's celebration.

121
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:46,600
It could break with a touch.

122
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:49,560
<i>Celebration?</i>

123
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:02,920
Boss, did you get into a fight?

124
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:04,720
Don't mention it.

125
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,440
Not only did I not find the Bone Relic,

126
00:11:08,080 --> 00:11:10,560
I almost got discovered as well.

127
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:14,040
Here.

128
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
There's no hurry.

129
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,960
The Bone Relic is lifeless,

130
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:19,200
but it's full of tricks.

131
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:21,160
It'll eventually cause trouble.

132
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:22,520
We will find traces of it.

133
00:11:22,920 --> 00:11:23,960
Mm.

134
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,080
Keep an eye on it.

135
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:26,520
- Mm.
- Don't worry.

136
00:11:32,360 --> 00:11:33,400
What is this?

137
00:11:33,480 --> 00:11:34,480
It's a new medicine.

138
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:36,240
It's a lost ancient remedy.

139
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:39,040
It can help you cleanse your bones
and become a full demon.

140
00:11:42,080 --> 00:11:44,920
How is it? How do you feel right now?

141
00:11:47,800 --> 00:11:49,000
I kind of want to…

142
00:11:57,720 --> 00:11:58,720
Hmm?

143
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:18,680
What should I do?

144
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,320
I'll get caught!

145
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:21,880
I think

146
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:23,160
it looks quite nice.

147
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:24,640
Do you have a tail?

148
00:12:28,280 --> 00:12:29,440
It's with her.

149
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:31,960
Boss!

150
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:36,400
Luckily, the ears are gone.

151
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:38,440
How dare you, demon?
Prepare to die!

152
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:54,800
You're old, and you just got back.

153
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:56,080
Aren't you tired?

154
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:57,840
Why are you playing around?

155
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:00,800
I'm a disciple of Changxi Palace.

156
00:13:00,880 --> 00:13:02,120
I told you.

157
00:13:02,200 --> 00:13:03,640
Changxi Palace is long gone.

158
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,760
It closed and left.

159
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:09,680
Uh… Don't mind me.

160
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:13,040
Let's talk about you and your sister.

161
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:15,240
Did you offend her again?

162
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:17,440
As you know,

163
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,200
I'm old and unmarried.

164
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:20,600
As long as I'm at home,

165
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:22,160
I'm offending her.

166
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,320
You're right.

167
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:26,800
Your sister is a bit strict with you.

168
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:28,680
But I believe

169
00:13:29,280 --> 00:13:31,840
that deep down, she still loves you.

170
00:13:32,120 --> 00:13:34,160
Although I can't help you deal with her,

171
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,520
my heart will always be with you.

172
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,160
Thank you so much.

173
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,640
Tell me. What's the matter?

174
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,920
Ah…

175
00:13:44,520 --> 00:13:46,120
Liu Gongshen

176
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:47,240
has been promoted.

177
00:13:47,320 --> 00:13:50,560
He's now the Minister of Personnel.

178
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:52,280
For his celebration,

179
00:13:53,960 --> 00:13:55,200
go on my behalf.

180
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,240
Why don't you go yourself?

181
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,600
I've already been dismissed.

182
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,960
Also, this is a mosquito repellent cup

183
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:07,880
that I got for you on my trip.

184
00:14:08,360 --> 00:14:09,720
Father, I'm begging you.

185
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,360
Can you stop bringing junk home?

186
00:14:12,440 --> 00:14:14,160
- Our house is a garbage dump.
- Eh!

187
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:16,960
These are rare treasures.

188
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:21,480
Zhen'er,

189
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,280
go on my behalf.

190
00:14:23,560 --> 00:14:24,680
Go to the banquet.

191
00:14:24,760 --> 00:14:25,760
Please.

192
00:14:25,840 --> 00:14:26,840
I'm begging you.

193
00:14:26,920 --> 00:14:28,000
All right.

194
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,080
I'll go.

195
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,680
My good daughter!

196
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,880
If you like these,

197
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:35,960
you can try them on.

198
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,040
All right.

199
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:38,320
It's such good material.

200
00:14:40,080 --> 00:14:42,240
Sir, look at these.

201
00:14:44,480 --> 00:14:46,480
Young Master Xie!

202
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Young Master.

203
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:53,480
Has the item that I brought
two days ago been repaired?

204
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:54,640
Yes.

205
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:55,920
Of course it has been.

206
00:14:57,680 --> 00:14:58,680
Look.

207
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:16,080
- How is it repaired?
- Huh?

208
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:17,600
Take a look.

209
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,880
A piece is missing.

210
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,720
I was careless.

211
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:25,880
How about this?
Sir, pick any item in my shop.

212
00:15:26,280 --> 00:15:28,360
I'll have it embedded. What do you say?

213
00:15:28,640 --> 00:15:31,000
You know how to do business.

214
00:15:31,080 --> 00:15:32,080
Very well.

215
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,440
I'll just pick one.

216
00:15:34,120 --> 00:15:35,320
You can make more money.

217
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,480
Thank you. This way, please.

218
00:15:37,880 --> 00:15:40,160
The quality of these is mediocre.

219
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:45,960
Hmm?

220
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll take this.

221
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:00,120
Since you've taken a liking to it,

222
00:16:00,440 --> 00:16:02,400
I'll have it embedded for you.

223
00:16:02,480 --> 00:16:03,480
What do you think?

224
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:05,360
Sure.

225
00:16:26,280 --> 00:16:28,680
This lantern is really rare.

226
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,080
Yes.

227
00:16:30,160 --> 00:16:31,240
Light it up.

228
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,520
I wonder what kind of paint was used
to paint this silhouette of a lady.

229
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:48,280
It's so vivid.

230
00:16:48,360 --> 00:16:49,400
Yes.

231
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:54,200
Look, it's as if
it will walk out of the wall.

232
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:56,920
You're right.

233
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,520
It would be even better
if she could dance and hum a tune.

234
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,840
Dance and hum a tune?

235
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,240
That's right.

236
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,400
It would be best if she could cook

237
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,040
and tidy up the house for me.

238
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,120
That's right.

239
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,480
She turned around!

240
00:17:12,920 --> 00:17:13,920
She…

241
00:17:14,680 --> 00:17:17,080
- She turned around.
- What do you mean?

242
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:19,480
I just saw her! She turned around!

243
00:17:19,560 --> 00:17:20,960
She turned around. She…

244
00:17:21,040 --> 00:17:22,040
- She…
- Huh?

245
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:26,640
Stop this nonsense.

246
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,240
Wrap up this lantern.

247
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:29,320
- No, I…
- Eh…

248
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:32,680
It's a gift for an important person.
It can't be delayed.

249
00:17:33,160 --> 00:17:34,200
No.

250
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,240
Liu Manor

251
00:18:01,960 --> 00:18:02,960
Little Zhuyu,

252
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:06,520
when my father heard
that you agreed to come, he was overjoyed.

253
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:09,800
- He praised me for persuading you.
- Yes, you did.

254
00:18:12,120 --> 00:18:13,120
I…

255
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,760
My last visit to the Liu manor

256
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:17,280
was five years ago.

257
00:18:17,960 --> 00:18:18,960
That time,

258
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:21,520
I waited outside for half a day.

259
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:24,480
When Lady Liu finally came out,

260
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,240
I proposed to her.

261
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:28,600
I haven't been able to forget

262
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:30,160
how Lady Liu looked at me.

263
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:34,560
She smiled as if we were to be engaged.

264
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
And then,

265
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:37,320
she said this.

266
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:39,040
"All right."

267
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:40,760
"Leave."

268
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:42,400
Since then,

269
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,560
she has returned all the gifts
I've given her.

270
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:49,000
She even said I wasn't allowed
within three feet of the Liu manor

271
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:50,560
or she'll send dogs after me.

272
00:18:51,400 --> 00:18:53,640
If Minister Liu wasn't holding
a celebration,

273
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:56,120
I wouldn't get to enter
the Liu manor again.

274
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:58,480
Sir, it's getting late.

275
00:18:58,560 --> 00:19:00,080
- It's time to go.
- Yes, let's go.

276
00:19:00,600 --> 00:19:01,640
Let's go.

277
00:19:01,720 --> 00:19:02,920
- I'll be here.
- Wait.

278
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:08,640
Whose young master is this?

279
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,400
Huh?

280
00:19:10,600 --> 00:19:12,200
What a shabby donkey carriage!

281
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:14,520
Yet, he still rode in it.

282
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:19,080
It's Young Master Mei
of the Bureau of Mystic Investigations.

283
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:22,560
Not long ago,
he offended County Princess Qinghe.

284
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:24,360
Oh!

285
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:25,760
So it's him.

286
00:19:49,560 --> 00:19:50,800
I'm really sorry.

287
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:52,760
Are you all right?

288
00:19:57,280 --> 00:19:59,080
Thank you for asking, Your Highness.

289
00:20:00,120 --> 00:20:01,800
We're fine.

290
00:20:02,040 --> 00:20:03,720
- We're fine.
- We're fine.

291
00:20:04,560 --> 00:20:06,640
The carriage His Majesty bestowed
is a pain.

292
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:08,800
It requires two horses.

293
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,400
I prefer that small
donkey carriage.

294
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:12,480
Huh?

295
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:16,160
It's exquisite and cute.

296
00:20:21,680 --> 00:20:23,440
Is your back all right?

297
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,640
It's all right. I'm lucky.

298
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:29,440
Let's go. After you.

299
00:20:30,280 --> 00:20:31,360
Slow down.

300
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:33,720
Looks like you're in a good mood today.

301
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:36,880
I'm really disappointed.

302
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:39,240
Don't worry.

303
00:20:39,320 --> 00:20:40,440
I'm here.

304
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,720
I won't let
other people's dogs bite you.

305
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,880
Liu Gongshen, Minister of Personnel

306
00:20:58,320 --> 00:20:59,960
My father couldn't come to Chang'an.

307
00:21:00,560 --> 00:21:03,600
He prepared gifts for you, Mr. Liu.

308
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,640
These are my father's treasures.

309
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:17,400
Huh?

310
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:25,400
Is this also the duke's treasure?

311
00:21:25,480 --> 00:21:26,480
Yes.

312
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,120
Huh?

313
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,200
Eh?

314
00:21:52,280 --> 00:21:53,520
Could it be that

315
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:55,680
a gentleman has feelings for Lady Liu

316
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:57,760
but accidentally mixed up the gifts?

317
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:01,160
But it doesn't look that good.

318
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:02,520
Indeed.

319
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:05,200
<i>It seems like I'll need</i>
<i>to find a chance to fix it.</i>

320
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,400
- Could it be Mei--
- Lady Wu gave it to me.

321
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,280
I heard that you two often fight.

322
00:22:18,800 --> 00:22:21,400
It seems to be a show of goodwill
from Lady Wu.

323
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:23,680
Congratulations.

324
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,680
You talk too much.

325
00:22:27,800 --> 00:22:28,800
This is mine.

326
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,320
I'll give it away or throw it away
as I please.

327
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:32,840
It's none of your business.

328
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:38,720
Roll it up.

329
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:53,200
Who is this from?

330
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:56,720
Mei Zhuyu of the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations.

331
00:22:56,800 --> 00:22:58,240
Greetings, Minister Liu.

332
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:02,080
So you're the Mei family's young son
who returned to Chang'an.

333
00:23:02,760 --> 00:23:04,160
I don't own much.

334
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:06,480
I hope you don't mind.

335
00:23:08,160 --> 00:23:09,960
Thank you, Young Master Mei.

336
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,560
This inkstone is smooth to the touch.

337
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:16,680
Although it looks plain,

338
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:19,320
it's a good material that's durable,

339
00:23:19,680 --> 00:23:21,600
just like Young Master Mei.

340
00:23:21,680 --> 00:23:22,760
You're still young.

341
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:24,320
With some training,

342
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:26,240
you will have a bright future.

343
00:23:26,560 --> 00:23:28,680
Thank you for the compliment,
Minister Liu.

344
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,080
Minister Liu is magnanimous and kind.

345
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,160
You're right.

346
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:38,240
May Young Master Mei
get over his frustration soon

347
00:23:38,320 --> 00:23:39,600
and have a bright future.

348
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:46,360
Young Master Xie,
are you looking down on Lady Wu?

349
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:48,240
What are you saying?

350
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,080
Didn't you hear what Lady Wu said?

351
00:23:51,320 --> 00:23:53,960
Even if it is something
that Lady Wu doesn't want,

352
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:56,200
others have no say in it.

353
00:23:58,040 --> 00:24:00,000
So if you see me again in the future,

354
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:02,560
don't try to give me advice.

355
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:15,280
Young Master Xie, enough nonsense.

356
00:24:15,360 --> 00:24:17,080
Bring out your gift.

357
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:19,720
Let us see how presentable it is.

358
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,400
I do have a gift for you.

359
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:29,080
It's also for Lady Liu.

360
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:33,040
I know Minister Liu cares not for riches.

361
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,400
So I thought I would give you a gift

362
00:24:35,680 --> 00:24:36,920
that Lady Liu can enjoy too.

363
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:38,880
This is…

364
00:24:40,680 --> 00:24:42,840
I made this
especially for Lady Liu.

365
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,120
It's a glass lantern.

366
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:47,440
Light it up.

367
00:25:01,280 --> 00:25:03,680
This glass lantern is exquisite.

368
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:06,280
The holder even has embedded gems.

369
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,320
It must've been very expensive.

370
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:11,280
Not at all.

371
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,560
The woman on the lantern…

372
00:25:14,360 --> 00:25:15,680
It's Lady Liu.

373
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,840
Please take a look.

374
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:20,960
There is a poem on there that I wrote.

375
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:24,480
"A languid life in the mountains
and valleys is but a dream.

376
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:28,800
Wealth and nobility are not daunting.

377
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:31,480
From Shutai drifts a farewell
over 3,000 miles.

378
00:25:32,760 --> 00:25:35,960
Only for the title of the poem
will all yearning fade."

379
00:25:36,040 --> 00:25:38,680
- It's a good poem.
- Excellent poem.

380
00:25:38,760 --> 00:25:40,880
No wonder you're the scholar of Chang'an.

381
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Your poem is romantic
and touching.

382
00:26:19,320 --> 00:26:21,600
Young Master Mei, you saw it too.

383
00:26:21,920 --> 00:26:23,480
Are you looking for it?

384
00:26:26,440 --> 00:26:27,440
Why?

385
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,200
Are you curious about me now?

386
00:26:32,720 --> 00:26:34,360
Evil spirits are rare in Chang'an.

387
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,600
But judging from your expression,

388
00:26:37,320 --> 00:26:39,640
you seem very calm about it.

389
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,880
I wouldn't say so.

390
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:50,440
After all, it's rare,
but that doesn't mean it won't occur.

391
00:26:51,280 --> 00:26:53,840
Now, you work in the record library.

392
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,760
Have you ever seen any scrolls
about me there?

393
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:08,920
<i>"Wu Zhen,</i>
<i>the second daughter of Duke Wu,</i>

394
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:10,120
<i>is 24 years old</i>

395
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:11,640
<i>and still unmarried.</i>

396
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:14,640
<i>She has met over 80 bachelors</i>

397
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:17,240
<i>and rejected them all."</i>

398
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:18,920
Wu Zhen

399
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,280
<i>Duke Wu aims to become</i>
<i>a Celestial Master.</i>

400
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:24,800
He has been searching for masters
for 20 years.

401
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:27,040
He has found many treasures

402
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:29,600
and been swindled of much money.

403
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:31,920
Having such a father,

404
00:27:32,600 --> 00:27:34,080
I've learned it from him.

405
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:37,280
I see.

406
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:43,240
I heard that many demons take human forms.

407
00:27:44,120 --> 00:27:46,560
Their temperament
is no different from humans.

408
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,520
Maybe there's a demon

409
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,160
among us.

410
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:53,680
As for tonight…

411
00:27:53,760 --> 00:27:55,240
If I'm not mistaken,

412
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:56,920
there should be a Shadow Demon.

413
00:27:57,960 --> 00:28:00,080
Maybe it's the shadow
of the glass lantern.

414
00:28:00,880 --> 00:28:01,880
Shadow Demon?

415
00:28:05,720 --> 00:28:07,200
You sure know a lot.

416
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:09,760
What a strange name.

417
00:28:09,840 --> 00:28:10,960
How do you know it?

418
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:15,080
I grew up in the countryside.

419
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,320
I'm used to talk of demons.

420
00:28:17,800 --> 00:28:20,720
Besides, you come from
a prestigious family in Chang'an.

421
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,720
You must know why the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations exists.

422
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:25,120
It's evident.

423
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,080
What's so strange?

424
00:28:28,720 --> 00:28:29,720
I see.

425
00:28:31,280 --> 00:28:34,280
So what can the head of the bureau do?

426
00:28:34,840 --> 00:28:36,880
After all, when a demon is around,

427
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:39,240
people are bound to be anxious.

428
00:28:40,560 --> 00:28:42,120
I've read about it in a book.

429
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:45,680
This kind of Shadow Demon hides
in people's shadows.

430
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,440
It often appears as a shadow.

431
00:28:50,280 --> 00:28:52,000
There are many guests tonight.

432
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:54,760
It's also time for lanterns to be lit.

433
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,640
The shadows flicker and blur.

434
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:02,600
Won't there be
more hiding places for demons?

435
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:56,240
Here.

436
00:29:57,360 --> 00:29:58,440
What's this?

437
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,120
My father bought it back from his trip.

438
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:03,600
A demon-exorcising treasure.

439
00:30:04,680 --> 00:30:05,880
It cost a lot of money.

440
00:30:06,640 --> 00:30:08,480
<i>Duke Wu was deceived again.</i>

441
00:30:10,520 --> 00:30:12,160
Isn't it amazing?

442
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:16,240
What about you? Do you have any ideas?

443
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:21,320
Have you ever played the game
of stepping on shadows?

444
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,520
What is that?

445
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:25,600
Light a candle in the room.

446
00:30:25,920 --> 00:30:27,400
One person chases everyone.

447
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:30,000
The chaser wins
by stepping on another's shadow.

448
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:32,400
The one who gets stepped on
becomes the chaser.

449
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:34,320
At that time, Master…

450
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:38,720
It was my favorite game.

451
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,560
Later, I came up with a sure way to win.

452
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,960
Put out the candle first

453
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:46,360
so all shadows disappear.

454
00:30:46,920 --> 00:30:48,240
Then move in the dark

455
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,800
and light the candle again.

456
00:30:49,880 --> 00:30:51,840
Then you can easily
step on someone's shadow.

457
00:30:53,520 --> 00:30:57,320
Are you saying we can put out the candles,

458
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:00,960
lure the demon out of the main hall,

459
00:31:01,040 --> 00:31:02,520
then find a deserted place

460
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,640
and make it appear right away?

461
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,720
What happens then?

462
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:10,080
After that…

463
00:31:12,800 --> 00:31:14,440
don't we have your treasure?

464
00:31:43,800 --> 00:31:44,920
I'll only help a bit.

465
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,240
- Why did the lights go out?
- Eh?

466
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,400
What is this?

467
00:33:27,040 --> 00:33:28,960
Guards! Light the candles!

468
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:31,320
Calm down.

469
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:33,200
We can't see. How can we drink?

470
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:25,160
Young Master.

471
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:15,560
You're so fast.

472
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:32,320
- A ghost!
- A ghost!

473
00:35:38,680 --> 00:35:39,960
Your man.

474
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:41,320
He's so heavy.

475
00:35:41,720 --> 00:35:43,040
What's going on?

476
00:35:43,960 --> 00:35:46,000
That Shadow Demon was near the study.

477
00:35:46,080 --> 00:35:47,320
It was quite vicious.

478
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:48,880
What?

479
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:25,200
Young Master.

480
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:29,880
Young Master.

481
00:36:30,640 --> 00:36:32,120
Which young master

482
00:36:32,520 --> 00:36:34,040
are you looking for, demon?

483
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,800
<i>The Bone Relic.</i>

484
00:37:59,720 --> 00:38:01,640
<i>The Bone Relic turned it into a demon.</i>

485
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:13,920
This is bad!

486
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:16,400
Minister, this is bad!

487
00:38:16,480 --> 00:38:18,760
There's a ghost!

488
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:24,520
There's a ghost!

489
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:27,480
There's a ghost!

490
00:38:27,880 --> 00:38:29,160
- Where?
- Nonsense!

491
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,320
What is he saying?

492
00:38:35,360 --> 00:38:36,600
Where is the ghost?

493
00:38:36,680 --> 00:38:38,560
- Over there.
- The ghost is there.

494
00:38:38,640 --> 00:38:40,480
I saw it myself!

495
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,360
Are you all right?

496
00:38:48,440 --> 00:38:49,440
Why are you here?

497
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:52,360
Did you find anything?

498
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,360
No.

499
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:56,680
I only saw the lantern from Xie Loubai.

500
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,600
Why did you give Lady Liu a portrait?

501
00:39:17,560 --> 00:39:18,640
It wasn't from me.

502
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:21,480
Someone put the portrait among my gifts.

503
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:22,960
That person is…

504
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:24,400
- Xiaosi.
- Xiaosi.

505
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,560
It's true that every person
has an admirer.

506
00:39:31,480 --> 00:39:32,480
What a pity.

507
00:39:33,000 --> 00:39:34,680
Xiaosi's sincerity is misplaced.

508
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:46,000
You're so meticulous.

509
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:48,040
And you're so handsome.

510
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:50,200
Why did you compare yourself

511
00:39:50,520 --> 00:39:52,440
to an item I don't want?

512
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:57,480
I was just borrowing your words.

513
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:01,600
You're too humble.

514
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,840
You're nothing special.

515
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:05,480
Lady Wu.

516
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,640
- Are you angry?
- Don't belittle me.

517
00:40:12,080 --> 00:40:13,080
How boring.

518
00:40:21,360 --> 00:40:23,200
"Poems by Xie Loubai."

519
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:28,280
"From Shutai drifts a farewell
over 3,000 miles.

520
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:31,280
Only for the title of the poem
will all yearning fade."

521
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:38,720
- That's not right.
- What's wrong?

522
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:45,080
What's engraved on the lantern

523
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,640
differs from the poem in the book.

524
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:50,160
Whether it's as written in the book

525
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,320
or as recited by Xie Loubai in public,

526
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,320
it's "from Shutai."

527
00:40:55,120 --> 00:40:57,800
On this lantern, it's "from Zhangtai."

528
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,960
But why was this word changed?

529
00:41:05,640 --> 00:41:08,720
Perhaps Xie Loubai is not the poet.

530
00:41:10,600 --> 00:41:12,160
A woman seems more likely.
