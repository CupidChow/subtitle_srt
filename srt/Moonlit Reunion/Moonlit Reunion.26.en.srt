00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,080
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,161 --> 00:01:33,960
(Episode 26)

3
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:55,439
Mei Zhu Yu...

4
00:02:56,605 --> 00:02:57,960
Whose name were you calling?

5
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,815
What's happening to me?

6
00:03:10,719 --> 00:03:13,056
There are two opposing forces in your body.

7
00:03:13,527 --> 00:03:16,423
It's likely that you've used too much of your power as Cat Lord.

8
00:03:16,864 --> 00:03:19,760
It's difficult for your mortal body to withstand it.

9
00:03:21,479 --> 00:03:22,542
I knew it.

10
00:03:23,199 --> 00:03:25,375
Being a demi-demon does make things difficult for me.

11
00:03:26,439 --> 00:03:29,095
That issue isn't that hard to resolve.

12
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,655
This won't happen again if you turn into a full demon.

13
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:38,576
Who said it isn't hard to resolve?

14
00:03:40,569 --> 00:03:42,225
You've been finding a solution for more than a decade.

15
00:03:43,719 --> 00:03:45,616
Even so, you haven't found it yet.

16
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,136
What if I say I know how to turn you into a full demon?

17
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,239
Really?

18
00:03:56,403 --> 00:03:57,540
I'm serious.

19
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:00,416
Although it's a radical method,

20
00:04:00,680 --> 00:04:04,495
we have no choice but to give it a try now.

21
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:11,856
Zhen, just follow my instructions.

22
00:04:12,479 --> 00:04:15,896
I won't harm you no matter what.

23
00:04:54,399 --> 00:04:55,776
What are you doing here?

24
00:04:56,264 --> 00:04:57,327
Where have you been?

25
00:04:58,800 --> 00:04:59,863
Ruyi Pavilion.

26
00:05:17,768 --> 00:05:19,663
Next time, don't go out with your hair still wet.

27
00:06:14,839 --> 00:06:15,902
What are you looking at?

28
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:18,416
Do you need anything?

29
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:22,160
A fierce beast, Yun Qi, was sent to the Demon Prison, right?

30
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,135
Lately, it has been causing a ruckus inside.

31
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,255
The Four Sects hired me to subdue it.

32
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:31,255
Since you're a book, do you know any methods of subduing it?

33
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:36,575
Those old fools. They couldn't even solve their own issues,

34
00:06:36,980 --> 00:06:39,236
yet they're the best at putting other people on the spot, huh?

35
00:06:39,439 --> 00:06:40,502
It doesn't matter.

36
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:43,416
I'll overcome every obstacle as they come.

37
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,495
One day, I will become a worthy Cat Lord.

38
00:06:54,540 --> 00:06:56,939
Yun Qi is afraid of loud noises. You can bring a cymbal with you.

39
00:06:57,079 --> 00:07:00,176
You can subdue it by hitting the cymbal.

40
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:03,015
You're amazing. How is it that you know everything?

41
00:07:04,328 --> 00:07:06,064
I don't remember my background.

42
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:09,815
But I think I might discover something as long as I read.

43
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,262
That'll definitely happen!

44
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:20,455
After giving it some thought,

45
00:07:21,191 --> 00:07:24,127
I'm new to the Demon City. I don't have any trusted subordinates.

46
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:26,015
Since Serpent Lord has two of them,

47
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,679
I need to have two as well.

48
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,416
Why don't you follow me and become my first right-hand man?

49
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:32,695
Forget about this bookstore.

50
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:35,600
If you serve me, you can open any number of bookstores in the Mortal Realm.

51
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:36,743
Will you join me?

52
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:38,423
Okay.

53
00:07:39,168 --> 00:07:41,830
If so, Shu, from now on, you belong to me.

54
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,462
Zhen.

55
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:52,776
Shu, come up here.

56
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:56,416
Look. Isn't it nice?

57
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:57,702
It's nice.

58
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,015
I remember that you hated medicine when you were young.

59
00:08:01,148 --> 00:08:03,165
I found out accidentally that you liked the candy they sell here.

60
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:04,736
You liked them so much

61
00:08:04,992 --> 00:08:06,511
that you wouldn't take any medicine without their candy.

62
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,679
And so, you went and persuaded the owner of that shop

63
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:12,960
to move it right beside the bookstore.

64
00:08:13,040 --> 00:08:14,103
Of course.

65
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:17,255
I'll help you achieve any goals you have.

66
00:08:18,417 --> 00:08:19,479
Don't worry.

67
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:21,921
I'll attend the meeting on your behalf later.

68
00:08:22,001 --> 00:08:23,319
Those old fools won't be able to bully you.

69
00:08:23,399 --> 00:08:24,462
Thank you.

70
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:26,736
My lady, I'm willing to clean up the aftermath for you.

71
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:32,896
We keep each other company all the time.

72
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,615
Naturally, it's touching.

73
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:38,296
Not that many things are destined to be so from birth, you know?

74
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,056
Our existence in this world

75
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,176
is not determined by others, or even the heavens.

76
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:49,016
You fell for Mei Zhu Yu?

77
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:50,776
Zhen, did you forget?

78
00:08:52,039 --> 00:08:53,102
You're a demon.

79
00:08:53,679 --> 00:08:56,016
I may be a demon, but I'm also a human.

80
00:08:56,480 --> 00:08:58,256
I have friends and family.

81
00:08:58,440 --> 00:09:00,360
Naturally, I will have a spouse as well.

82
00:09:00,440 --> 00:09:02,975
Time flies by in the blink of an eye.

83
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,935
I also wish to experience what it feels like to live as a mortal.

84
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:10,896
But he's just an ordinary mortal.

85
00:09:12,427 --> 00:09:15,723
Zhen, are you sure you can trust him?

86
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,143
Yeah.

87
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:18,663
He's a great person.

88
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,776
When I'm with him, I feel safe and secure.

89
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:25,896
So, are you saying

90
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,095
that I've never made you feel safe and secure?

91
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:32,240
Shu, we devote ourselves to each other

92
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:34,496
because we're companions. We're best friends.

93
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:36,376
But he's different.

94
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:39,760
He truly acknowledges me and fancies me.

95
00:09:39,840 --> 00:09:41,136
But I fancy you too.

96
00:09:41,919 --> 00:09:42,982
What did you say?

97
00:09:43,159 --> 00:09:45,455
Zhen, we've been together for 18 years.

98
00:09:45,759 --> 00:09:47,296
You've only been with him for several months.

99
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,095
Are you sure you want to choose him?

100
00:09:50,559 --> 00:09:52,935
I thought we were best friends.

101
00:09:54,039 --> 00:09:55,102
(Just friends, huh?)

102
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,063
Wait.

103
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:31,462
Where are you going?

104
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:35,416
I'm going to wake Young Master for breakfast.

105
00:10:36,039 --> 00:10:38,215
He has already gone on duty at court.

106
00:10:39,223 --> 00:10:42,399
Why is he so early today? He even skipped breakfast.

107
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,735
If so, has Young Master given me any instructions?

108
00:10:48,039 --> 00:10:49,102
No.

109
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,095
Why don't I wake Her Highness up, then?

110
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:54,903
No need for that.

111
00:10:55,321 --> 00:10:56,400
Huh?

112
00:10:56,481 --> 00:10:58,735
Her Highness never wakes up early.

113
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:07,711
I'm only able to locate this place after casting a tracking spell

114
00:11:07,791 --> 00:11:09,376
on the shadow demon.

115
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,296
But there are no traces of demons here.

116
00:11:12,256 --> 00:11:14,211
Although I know where the Demon City of Chang'an is,

117
00:11:14,291 --> 00:11:16,751
I don't know how to enter it.

118
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,896
So, even you have no solutions, huh?

119
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:22,536
Seems like we cannot underestimate the Demon City after all.

120
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:26,935
No one can comprehend the thoughts of demons easily.

121
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,776
There are records of it in the Arcane Appraisal Bureau's case files.

122
00:11:31,039 --> 00:11:32,416
But it's only a few brief words.

123
00:11:33,819 --> 00:11:34,949
What did it state?

124
00:11:35,039 --> 00:11:37,520
This place was originally known as Goddess Wa Temple.

125
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:38,663
Goddess Wa Temple?

126
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:41,735
Goddess Wa is a goddess with a human head and a snake body.

127
00:11:42,077 --> 00:11:43,363
She created the beings of the three realms

128
00:11:43,443 --> 00:11:45,133
and was revered as the Mother of the Earth.

129
00:11:45,747 --> 00:11:50,683
Coincidentally, this temple was brought to ruin 18 years ago.

130
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:52,859
From that, we basically know

131
00:11:53,129 --> 00:11:55,366
that the Divine Fire Chaos 18 years ago was caused by the Demon City.

132
00:11:56,466 --> 00:11:59,683
If this Goddess Wa Temple is the place where the two realms are connected,

133
00:12:00,559 --> 00:12:02,815
I suppose it makes sense for it to be implicated.

134
00:12:03,759 --> 00:12:05,855
But, they're actually bold enough to burn down this temple.

135
00:12:06,919 --> 00:12:10,016
The Demon City is ambitious indeed.

136
00:12:10,559 --> 00:12:14,735
Even after the chaos back then, the Demon City didn't abandon this place.

137
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,215
It seems that they're very confident in the barrier they've set up.

138
00:12:18,879 --> 00:12:23,056
According to Master, there's a way to dispel every barrier.

139
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,423
Hurry and leave.

140
00:12:37,735 --> 00:12:38,775
Lady Liu.

141
00:12:38,919 --> 00:12:40,680
I heard that Fourth Master Si is bedridden with illness.

142
00:12:40,798 --> 00:12:42,254
I came here to visit him.

143
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,063
Bedridden with illness?

144
00:12:44,919 --> 00:12:45,982
Isn't he?

145
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,663
So nosy.

146
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:53,880
It's fine.

147
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,656
Look. There's a bird's nest over here.

148
00:12:57,320 --> 00:12:58,855
- When did that happen?   - Lady Liu.

149
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,455
- Please.   - Isn't this adorable?

150
00:13:02,679 --> 00:13:04,640
- Look.   - There are two more.

151
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:05,783
That's right.

152
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:08,503
Mei Si.

153
00:13:09,799 --> 00:13:10,862
Lady Liu?

154
00:13:13,679 --> 00:13:15,815
Lady Liu, what are you doing here?

155
00:13:16,360 --> 00:13:19,656
I thought you were bedridden with illness due to the demonic powers.

156
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:23,000
That's not true. I swear. I'm totally fine.

157
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:26,536
Look. I'm not influenced by it at all. What you said wasn't true.

158
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,815
Are you itching for another beating?

159
00:13:37,526 --> 00:13:39,485
Since you're already here, you two should have a chat.

160
00:13:39,639 --> 00:13:41,735
I'll go and take a stroll.

161
00:13:41,919 --> 00:13:42,982
I'll take a walk.

162
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:45,975
Master Snake, you're the best.

163
00:13:50,039 --> 00:13:51,040
Please don't blame him for this.

164
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:54,799
A few days ago, I told him that it'd been some time since I saw you.

165
00:13:54,879 --> 00:13:56,095
I told him that I missed you.

166
00:13:56,559 --> 00:13:57,815
I was just saying.

167
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:00,855
I never expected Master Snake to be such a great friend.

168
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,815
Xuan Hui is one of the greater demons of the Rain Dragon Clan.

169
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:06,815
How did you manage to bribe him

170
00:14:07,264 --> 00:14:10,519
and make him devote himself to you?

171
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:15,615
Perhaps I just happen to be favored by snakes.

172
00:14:20,879 --> 00:14:24,095
Since I'm already here, there's something I have to remind you.

173
00:14:24,679 --> 00:14:27,536
During Kitty's wedding, you were influenced by demonic powers.

174
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:31,575
You publicly declared that I was your wife and that we were together.

175
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:34,935
This matter has been spreading like wildfire. The rumors were unpleasant.

176
00:14:35,480 --> 00:14:36,615
Have you heard about them?

177
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,136
I did hear a little about them.

178
00:14:41,759 --> 00:14:44,416
Old Liu is getting restless as well.

179
00:14:44,840 --> 00:14:48,855
He kept bringing up our marriage time and time again.

180
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,994
Fourth Master Si, please don't misunderstand me

181
00:14:53,074 --> 00:14:55,215
if you heard any rumors about us.

182
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:58,063
Understood.

183
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:07,455
Lady Liu, watch out!

184
00:15:13,214 --> 00:15:14,280
Fourth Master Si!

185
00:15:14,360 --> 00:15:15,423
Fourth Master Si!

186
00:15:16,120 --> 00:15:17,800
- Fourth Master Si!   - Fourth Master Si!

187
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:20,120
- Fourth Master Si!   - Don't touch me!

188
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:21,360
Fourth Master Si, are you okay?

189
00:15:48,559 --> 00:15:49,622
Is that

190
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:52,822
realgar powder?

191
00:15:53,399 --> 00:15:54,462
This is bad.

192
00:16:02,879 --> 00:16:05,176
Lady Liu, are you okay?

193
00:16:13,431 --> 00:16:16,120
I was over the moon when I saw you. That's why I forgot to tell you.

194
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,208
The servants have been scattering realgar powder

195
00:16:18,288 --> 00:16:19,935
around the residence to get rid of snakes and mice.

196
00:16:22,559 --> 00:16:23,855
You actually forgot about that?

197
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,656
I'll remember next time.

198
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:33,383
Does it hurt?

199
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:35,815
It's getting more and more painful.

200
00:16:36,747 --> 00:16:37,923
Let me take a look.

201
00:16:49,799 --> 00:16:51,215
You're bitten by a snake.

202
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:55,503
Fourth Master Si!

203
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:02,335
Fourth Master Si, are you okay?

204
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:04,936
Quickly, go find a physician who can treat snake venom.

205
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:06,422
Yes, Lady Liu.

206
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:20,415
I don't think we have an appointment today.

207
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:23,736
Sorry for the abrupt visit. I'm here to seek your help.

208
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,256
I gave it some thought after heading back.

209
00:17:26,359 --> 00:17:29,216
Although we can't tell what's wrong with Goddess Wa Temple,

210
00:17:29,759 --> 00:17:31,415
we may change our approach.

211
00:17:32,079 --> 00:17:33,142
Do you intend to set up a barrier?

212
00:17:33,279 --> 00:17:35,655
That's right. It's indeed easy to speak with my peer.

213
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:38,016
I've already discussed this with Sect Leader.

214
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,380
I intend to set up array eyes throughout Chang'an

215
00:17:40,460 --> 00:17:43,056
and use the power of the terrain to pry open the barrier.

216
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,895
Have you guys already made up your mind?

217
00:17:46,119 --> 00:17:48,696
That's right. Sect Leader has already agreed to it.

218
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:52,943
Do you have any objections?

219
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:58,503
Yes, I do.

220
00:17:59,599 --> 00:18:00,662
This is too hasty.

221
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:03,679
Not at all! Sect Leader and I stayed up all night just to discuss it.

222
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:05,719
Trust me. I can definitely dispel that barrier.

223
00:18:05,799 --> 00:18:07,199
Why don't I explain my method to you?

224
00:18:07,279 --> 00:18:08,342
That's unnecessary.

225
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:10,039
Within Changxi Palace,

226
00:18:10,119 --> 00:18:12,895
there's no one better than you when it comes to arrays and formations.

227
00:18:14,359 --> 00:18:15,422
Indeed.

228
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:17,600
But one cannot fight a war without any forces.

229
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:21,256
I came here to borrow the map of Chang'an from you.

230
00:18:23,160 --> 00:18:24,223
All right.

231
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:26,519
Zhu Yu, if I remember correctly,

232
00:18:26,599 --> 00:18:31,320
Arcane Appraisal Bureau was built with the assistance of Changxi Palace.

233
00:18:31,400 --> 00:18:32,463
Is that right?

234
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:34,047
Indeed.

235
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,415
No wonder there are anti-demon arrays in front of the halls.

236
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:40,056
I was wondering why the structure around this courtyard well

237
00:18:40,240 --> 00:18:42,976
closely resembles the ancient drawings of Changxi Palace.

238
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:47,296
I think this array can reveal a demon's true form.

239
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:51,142
Sadly, time has worn it down. No one was maintaining it.

240
00:18:51,359 --> 00:18:53,056
It has become a useless relic.

241
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:07,696
- Enough. Stop moving.   - Go easy on me!

242
00:19:07,898 --> 00:19:08,961
That hurts!

243
00:19:12,440 --> 00:19:13,759
That hurts!

244
00:19:13,839 --> 00:19:15,175
Enough. Stop screaming.

245
00:19:15,400 --> 00:19:17,016
Can you be more gentle?

246
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:21,401
- Stop moving.   - That's not it.

247
00:19:21,481 --> 00:19:22,855
You're wriggling like a worm.

248
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,263
That startled me.

249
00:19:29,160 --> 00:19:30,223
Why are you screaming?

250
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:38,263
How is he?

251
00:19:39,319 --> 00:19:42,615
Head Mei, please don't worry. Fourth Master Si is fine.

252
00:19:42,759 --> 00:19:44,519
I've neutralized the snake venom as well.

253
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:45,662
I'm glad to hear that.

254
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,456
My son was mischievous. Sorry for the trouble.

255
00:19:50,680 --> 00:19:51,743
Farewell.

256
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,463
Thank you.

257
00:20:07,519 --> 00:20:09,736
Lady Liu, great timing.

258
00:20:10,119 --> 00:20:12,736
These past few days, Minister Liu and I have been discussing something.

259
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:15,575
You two have been engaged since childhood.

260
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:18,936
And now, you guys are already all grown up.

261
00:20:19,799 --> 00:20:22,456
I suppose we should discuss the marriage between you two.

262
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,263
Uncle.

263
00:20:27,599 --> 00:20:28,662
I know.

264
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,296
My son, Si, has rendered no merit.

265
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,536
He doesn't know how to do business.

266
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:36,895
Not only is he weak,

267
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:40,976
but he's also unskilled in his studies.

268
00:20:43,079 --> 00:20:44,142
What's wrong?

269
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,976
Did I say anything wrong?

270
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:50,415
- But luckily, he's an honest boy.   - Your father's right.

271
00:20:50,599 --> 00:20:52,575
He has admired you for many years as well.

272
00:20:52,839 --> 00:20:54,175
If you marry into our family,

273
00:20:54,319 --> 00:20:57,815
with our influence in the state, we can definitely treat you well.

274
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,296
I think we should discuss this when my father is around.

275
00:21:03,839 --> 00:21:05,456
Lady Liu, please don't worry.

276
00:21:05,799 --> 00:21:06,999
Since you two have feelings for each other,

277
00:21:07,079 --> 00:21:10,175
naturally, as your parents, we can take delight.

278
00:21:14,839 --> 00:21:16,175
We have feelings for each other?

279
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,840
During Princess Qing He's wedding,

280
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,575
my son expressed his heartfelt feelings after getting drunk.

281
00:21:21,799 --> 00:21:24,175
Everyone there heard what he said.

282
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:27,216
And, you two are seeing each other today.

283
00:21:27,599 --> 00:21:30,815
Lady Liu, you're very concerned about my boy.

284
00:21:31,359 --> 00:21:32,976
How could it possibly be wrong?

285
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,063
- Actually.   - I don't want it.

286
00:21:44,599 --> 00:21:45,662
What did you say?

287
00:21:46,200 --> 00:21:48,296
I said, I don't want to get married.

288
00:21:50,880 --> 00:21:52,736
Did all the food you eat get to your brain?

289
00:21:53,480 --> 00:21:55,216
Did the buns affect your mind from thinking?

290
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,496
Everyone knows about your intentions all these years.

291
00:21:59,720 --> 00:22:02,536
Look at all the portraits you've hung in your room.

292
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:05,216
Who do you think is the subject of those portraits?

293
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,600
We were going to discuss your marriage, you know?

294
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,135
Why are you trying to jeopardize it?

295
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,976
Lady Liu, please don't mind him.

296
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:19,400
He was bitten by a snake. I think the venom has damaged his brain.

297
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:21,135
He'll return to normal in a few more days.

298
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:26,016
Once he settles down, his unruly nature will surely change.

299
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:29,855
Don't worry. I'll pay a visit to your residence with him tomorrow.

300
00:22:30,079 --> 00:22:32,335
We'll discuss the marriage with Minister Liu officially.

301
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:34,296
We won't let you down.

302
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:36,679
Father, I'm serious.

303
00:22:36,759 --> 00:22:39,640
I don't want to get married. Now, I don't feel like marrying Lady Liu.

304
00:22:39,720 --> 00:22:41,256
What are you saying?

305
00:22:41,480 --> 00:22:44,216
I thought you desired the marriage.

306
00:22:44,519 --> 00:22:47,095
What? You think you can cancel it just like that?

307
00:22:47,279 --> 00:22:49,239
That's right! I regret it now.

308
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:51,256
I'm unhappy with it. I'm not marrying Lady Liu.

309
00:22:51,359 --> 00:22:52,696
Such nonsense!

310
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,776
Why did the Mei family raise a useless son like you?

311
00:22:56,079 --> 00:22:58,936
You were the one who always said that I was the disgrace of the family.

312
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,095
Say that again if you dare!

313
00:23:03,425 --> 00:23:06,144
Just like what you said, I'm the disgrace of the Mei family.

314
00:23:06,279 --> 00:23:07,895
I don't want to ruin Lady Liu's future!

315
00:23:49,599 --> 00:23:51,976
Your father was pretty ruthless, huh?

316
00:23:54,359 --> 00:23:57,776
Master Snake, you never miss out on any shows, don't you?

317
00:23:58,247 --> 00:24:01,303
Of course. I'm free the entire day.

318
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,736
Watching shows is my only agenda for the day.

319
00:24:07,739 --> 00:24:11,476
So, Lady Liu, whom you wanted to call off the engagement with,

320
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:13,895
she sent me here to ask you something.

321
00:24:15,039 --> 00:24:16,256
What did she say?

322
00:24:17,559 --> 00:24:19,855
She wanted to know why you declined the marriage.

323
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:27,575
It's better for me to be known as an irresponsible man

324
00:24:28,279 --> 00:24:30,615
than putting Lady Liu on the spot.

325
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:39,406
So, you're just afraid that her reputation might be ruined

326
00:24:39,486 --> 00:24:40,822
if she calls off the marriage?

327
00:24:42,599 --> 00:24:44,135
She's a demon, you know?

328
00:24:44,359 --> 00:24:47,655
Her reputation as Lady Liu is nothing more than a fleeting illusion.

329
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:48,862
So what if it's affected?

330
00:24:50,440 --> 00:24:52,095
If so, the more I have to call off the marriage.

331
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:54,415
I didn't know about her identity in the past.

332
00:24:55,287 --> 00:24:57,704
I viewed her actions from a mortal's perspective.

333
00:24:58,119 --> 00:24:59,655
But now, I know that she's a powerful demon.

334
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:03,296
It's already tough enough for her to yield and bow to mortal customs.

335
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:07,256
How could I let her be bound by mortal rules when it comes to her marriage?

336
00:25:16,119 --> 00:25:17,335
Come here. Let me take a look.

337
00:25:18,839 --> 00:25:19,902
It's here.

338
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:21,303
Here, huh?

339
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:22,983
That hurts.

340
00:25:23,279 --> 00:25:24,841
- You...   - How much does it hurt?

341
00:25:24,921 --> 00:25:26,039
Let me see.

342
00:25:26,119 --> 00:25:27,439
I won't touch it again.

343
00:25:27,519 --> 00:25:28,582
Go away.

344
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:33,895
Did he actually say that?

345
00:25:40,874 --> 00:25:42,513
So, in his heart,

346
00:25:42,593 --> 00:25:47,520
we demons were never meant to be hunted and reviled by all.

347
00:25:48,319 --> 00:25:52,056
We should lead a carefree and unrestrained life instead, huh?

348
00:26:46,119 --> 00:26:47,496
You should sleep tonight.

349
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:24,216
Seems like I have to give her a push.

350
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:27,703
Here you go.

351
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,783
- Thank you.   - Don't mention it.

352
00:27:36,039 --> 00:27:37,120
Hey, make way.

353
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:38,263
Make way.

354
00:27:38,759 --> 00:27:39,822
Make way.

355
00:27:41,440 --> 00:27:42,503
Lord Shu.

356
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:44,582
What is it?

357
00:27:45,599 --> 00:27:47,296
Many lesser demons have gone missing lately.

358
00:27:47,376 --> 00:27:49,080
There weren't any follow-ups either.

359
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:51,296
Should we report this to Cat Lord and Serpent Lord?

360
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,855
It's common for lesser demons to perish during their cultivation.

361
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,016
There's no need to report such trivial affairs.

362
00:27:57,160 --> 00:27:58,936
But if we don't report it...

363
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,056
Yes, Lord Shu.

364
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:48,296
Stop screaming.

365
00:28:48,799 --> 00:28:52,048
You guys should count your blessings for being able to

366
00:28:52,232 --> 00:28:54,237
contribute to her transformation with your death.

367
00:29:42,799 --> 00:29:46,776
Brother Chi Hua, have you made any discoveries?

368
00:29:49,400 --> 00:29:50,463
No.

369
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:53,815
However, I've already found a way to enter the Demon City.

370
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,456
What? You found a solution already?

371
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:01,135
Shuang Jiang, although you didn't contribute to our first discovery,

372
00:30:01,519 --> 00:30:04,135
you don't need to be too upset about it.

373
00:30:04,279 --> 00:30:05,680
You'll have plenty of chances in the future.

374
00:30:07,559 --> 00:30:08,655
I'll go inside and take another look.

375
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:19,239
If so, I'll head back first.

376
00:30:19,319 --> 00:30:22,303
Shuang Jiang, are you hungry or not?

377
00:30:22,960 --> 00:30:24,023
I am.

378
00:30:24,160 --> 00:30:25,415
Do you want some good food?

379
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:27,102
Sure.

380
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:28,463
Let's go.

381
00:30:32,759 --> 00:30:35,239
Two bowls of mutton in broth and two Hu flatbreads.

382
00:30:35,319 --> 00:30:36,382
All right.

383
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:39,655
Guys, please enjoy your meal.

384
00:30:52,039 --> 00:30:54,815
Although the broth is clear, it has a strong taste.

385
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:57,575
Does it suit your taste?

386
00:30:58,480 --> 00:30:59,543
It's excellent.

387
00:31:02,039 --> 00:31:04,609
Zhu Yu, be it in cultivation and the Way,

388
00:31:04,689 --> 00:31:06,696
in scholarship and literacy, or in the arts of healing and of arms,

389
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,135
I am inferior to you in every respect.

390
00:31:08,410 --> 00:31:12,186
But when it comes to good food, I'm the expert here.

391
00:31:13,000 --> 00:31:15,496
Let's take this mutton in broth as an example. The broth is its essence.

392
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:18,016
If you eat a Hu flatbread without any broth or soup,

393
00:31:19,039 --> 00:31:21,016
it'll be wasted.

394
00:31:22,200 --> 00:31:23,335
You do quite a lot, huh?

395
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:25,175
What else do you know?

396
00:31:25,400 --> 00:31:26,463
I also know

397
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,056
that there are various styles for this dish alone.

398
00:31:31,039 --> 00:31:32,696
The Pucheng style favors Sichuan peppercorn

399
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:34,895
while the Chengcheng style favors fennel.

400
00:31:37,880 --> 00:31:41,456
Why don't you guess what style this is?

401
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:42,976
Of course it's the Pucheng style.

402
00:31:44,759 --> 00:31:47,415
A few days ago, I discovered that he used a lot of Sichuan peppercorns.

403
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:50,256
He could put up to 20 of them in one bowl of broth.

404
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,496
That's why I was craving it.

405
00:31:54,680 --> 00:31:55,936
You do have sharp eyes.

406
00:31:56,279 --> 00:31:57,342
Of course.

407
00:31:58,359 --> 00:32:00,039
You could tell even if you were far away, huh?

408
00:32:00,119 --> 00:32:01,216
As long as I want to.

409
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,080
What did you see behind Ruyi Pavilion when the shadow demon attacked?

410
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:05,223
I saw Lady Hu...

411
00:32:05,400 --> 00:32:06,463
Hu...

412
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,175
I'm choking on the Hu flatbread.

413
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:27,536
Zhu Yu, how did you find out?

414
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:31,112
You were abnormally anxious back then.

415
00:32:31,192 --> 00:32:33,335
You were acting strange when Chi Hua was there.

416
00:32:34,119 --> 00:32:36,116
All these years, you might have slacked off when it came to training,

417
00:32:36,197 --> 00:32:39,374
but you always took your demon-subduing missions seriously.

418
00:32:40,039 --> 00:32:43,335
I'm sure you saw something important that night.

419
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,776
That's why you chose to hide it from us.

420
00:32:46,440 --> 00:32:48,335
I'm going to be a hero, you know?

421
00:32:49,079 --> 00:32:51,135
Who will benefit from me hiding such a secret?

422
00:32:51,240 --> 00:32:52,736
Yeah. I wonder who.

423
00:32:53,359 --> 00:32:57,256
Who in Chang'an could make you hide such a secret?

424
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,320
And, that individual is related to Ruyi Pavilion as well.

425
00:33:00,039 --> 00:33:03,095
It's Lady Hu Zhu, whom you're indebted to.

426
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:08,976
So, you saw her that night, huh?

427
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:29,135
Back then, I was eating in the backyard of Ruyi Pavilion.

428
00:33:30,519 --> 00:33:32,496
I saw Lady Hu Zhu holding a cat in her arms.

429
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,815
After that, she vanished into thin air.

430
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,776
It was just my speculation.

431
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:45,175
So, I suppose she went to pick up the cat demon.

432
00:33:47,839 --> 00:33:49,575
You wanted to be a hero, right?

433
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:52,936
Why would you spare a demon because of your own desire?

434
00:33:53,359 --> 00:33:57,335
Zhu Yu, even if Lady Hu Zhu is a demon, she's not an evil one.

435
00:33:57,440 --> 00:34:01,335
If not, someone would've died in Ruyi Pavilion long ago.

436
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:06,375
Moreover, she spends time with you and your spouse every day.

437
00:34:08,440 --> 00:34:10,456
She and your wife spend every day together.

438
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:16,936
Zhu Yu, people say that fox demons excel at bewitching men.

439
00:34:17,480 --> 00:34:20,095
Your wife, whom you've been smitten with,

440
00:34:21,159 --> 00:34:23,215
she can't be a fox demon, can she?

441
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:42,456
You look happy. Has anything happened lately?

442
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,119
I've been a demi-demon for a long time.

443
00:34:45,199 --> 00:34:47,936
Now, Shu has finally found a way to turn me into a full demon.

444
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:49,856
Of course I'm happy.

445
00:34:50,966 --> 00:34:52,902
Let me rain on your parade, then.

446
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:56,735
Your mortal husband might discover your identity, you know?

447
00:34:59,039 --> 00:35:02,336
Husbands and wives shouldn't keep things from each other.

448
00:35:02,719 --> 00:35:04,496
However, I need to manage the Demon City.

449
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:08,615
Naturally, I feel guilty toward him.

450
00:35:09,208 --> 00:35:10,583
Stop being so naive.

451
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,175
If he finds out, he'll definitely leave you.

452
00:35:15,616 --> 00:35:18,592
He might even try to take your life.

453
00:35:18,920 --> 00:35:20,936
That won't happen. I trust him.

454
00:35:21,239 --> 00:35:22,816
Not everyone is Mr. Duan.

455
00:35:23,159 --> 00:35:24,336
Let's take Mei Si as an example.

456
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:27,775
He's still loyal to you even after he found out about your identity.

457
00:35:28,599 --> 00:35:32,215
Mei Si? He's a fool.

458
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:35,856
Mr. Mei isn't a fool.

459
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:37,255
I know.

460
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:43,856
But I believe that there are vile mortals out there.

461
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,575
There are kind demons as well.

462
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:50,536
Mei Zhu Yu can differentiate between right and wrong.

463
00:35:50,719 --> 00:35:53,496
He and I are already prepared to face everything.

464
00:36:00,559 --> 00:36:01,622
My lords.

465
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:06,896
All right. That's all from me.

466
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:09,063
I'll be leaving now.

467
00:36:12,360 --> 00:36:14,175
Shu, what's the matter?

468
00:36:15,679 --> 00:36:18,360
Several Celestial Masters have infiltrated Chang'an.

469
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:19,503
What?

470
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,063
Sorry for the trouble.

471
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:33,416
Are you sure you want me to restore this array?

472
00:36:33,719 --> 00:36:35,016
Look how badly it has fallen apart.

473
00:36:35,821 --> 00:36:39,420
(Since there's such a chance, we shouldn't let it go to waste.)

474
00:36:39,559 --> 00:36:42,855
(If we restore it, we might be able to use it again.)

475
00:36:42,936 --> 00:36:44,079
That's right.

476
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:46,260
All right. I'll give it a try.

477
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,295
You may instruct someone to stand here.

478
00:37:48,719 --> 00:37:50,695
Nothing will happen if the individual is a mortal.

479
00:37:51,039 --> 00:37:52,135
However, if it's a demon,

480
00:37:52,559 --> 00:37:55,575
this array will reveal their true form.

481
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:04,639
Boss, I've finished my investigation.

482
00:38:04,719 --> 00:38:07,056
The Celestial Masters are definitely up to something.

483
00:38:07,639 --> 00:38:10,695
But they were very sneaky. I couldn't get any details.

484
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,336
We mustn't allow them to get their way.

485
00:38:28,920 --> 00:38:32,536
They have to get through me before laying a finger on the Demon City.

486
00:38:35,944 --> 00:38:37,433
Xiang.

487
00:38:37,514 --> 00:38:38,776
(Xiang)

488
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:41,343
Cat Lord.

489
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,503
Please do me a favor.

490
00:38:45,760 --> 00:38:47,295
Please give me your instructions.
