00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,600
Episode 4

2
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,120
Perhaps Xie Loubai is not the poet.

3
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:42,000
A woman seems more likely.

4
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:54,800
This…

5
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,280
Your Highness.

6
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:03,400
What happened here?

7
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,480
Nothing.

8
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,480
The servants reported
that they saw something ominous.

9
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:10,200
- That's right.
- Yes.

10
00:02:10,280 --> 00:02:11,720
- There was nothing.
- Ominous?

11
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:14,800
Why didn't I see it?

12
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:22,760
The servants must have been mistaken.

13
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:24,120
Everything's fine then.

14
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:27,640
Everything is fine.
Carry on with the banquet.

15
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:29,160
- All right.
- Okay.

16
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:30,360
- Let's go.
- Let's go back.

17
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,720
- Let's go back and have another drink.
- That's right.

18
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,880
Chang'an is the imperial capital.

19
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:36,640
There can't be so many strange things.

20
00:02:39,320 --> 00:02:40,560
Where's that lamp?

21
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:42,200
Where did it go?

22
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:44,760
I'll go out and look.

23
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,080
Did you see the Shadow Demon again?

24
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,080
The Bone Relic is gone again.

25
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:16,080
Yes, it was still here before the banquet.

26
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,000
Did it grow legs?
We can't seem to catch it.

27
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:22,920
We can only take
the Shadow Demon away first.

28
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:24,640
Wait.

29
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,840
There's something you have to do.

30
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:37,000
Young Master.

31
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,800
Why are you here?

32
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,920
Just now,

33
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,440
I saw something.

34
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,600
A man and a woman alone
in a dark room. That's…

35
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:54,120
You're right.

36
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:56,560
Lady Wu is really like what they say.

37
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,280
She is indeed flirtatious.

38
00:03:58,760 --> 00:04:01,000
She's looking for a man
to marry into her family.

39
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:02,800
Young Master Mei is a lucky man.

40
00:04:02,880 --> 00:04:04,640
- That's right.
- He's very lucky.

41
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:06,480
He's indeed lucky.

42
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:08,440
Regardless of her intentions…

43
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:11,800
…women are different from men.

44
00:04:11,880 --> 00:04:14,880
She should pay attention
to her reputation.

45
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:16,640
- Yes.
- You're right.

46
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:17,720
You're right.

47
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,760
Show yourself.

48
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:48,960
Little Kitty entrusted you to me.

49
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,560
So, I'll help you this time.

50
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,600
Young Master.

51
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,160
Don't worry.

52
00:04:57,840 --> 00:04:59,480
I'll bring him to you now.

53
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:22,800
Thank you, Young Master.

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,320
Thank you, Lady Liu.

55
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:27,480
I'm truly honored to meet you here.

56
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,880
It's an honor for me, too.

57
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:33,520
I really liked the poetry collection
you gave me.

58
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:37,160
Every word truly shows your feelings.

59
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:38,440
Your story is impressive.

60
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:41,400
Lady Liu, you flatter me.

61
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,640
However,

62
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:47,040
I heard that it wasn't written by you.

63
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:50,960
My lady, that's a funny joke.

64
00:05:52,040 --> 00:05:54,760
Who started such a rumor?

65
00:05:56,720 --> 00:05:58,120
It was me.

66
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:05,240
Just now…

67
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,760
Ghost.

68
00:06:20,360 --> 00:06:22,760
- It's a ghost.
- Take a good look at her.

69
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,840
- Do you not recognize her?
- Young Master.

70
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:30,160
You…

71
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,800
What do you want?

72
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:36,600
What trick are you playing?

73
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:38,640
Thank you, Young Master.

74
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,840
You're the one who brought Yunyi here.

75
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,240
Who's Yunyi? I don't know her.

76
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,840
About three to four years ago,

77
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:55,560
Yunyi was famous for her talent
in Chang'an Brothel.

78
00:06:57,160 --> 00:06:58,640
You were her patron.

79
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,400
This glass lantern was Yunyi's favorite.

80
00:07:05,320 --> 00:07:08,840
The figure on the lantern is Yunyi.

81
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:12,160
But you took the lantern.

82
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,400
You mended it,
and then, you gave it to me.

83
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,600
Lady Liu, what do you mean?

84
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:21,720
I don't understand.

85
00:07:24,480 --> 00:07:25,680
Young Master.

86
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:31,800
Young Master.

87
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,000
You…

88
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:35,040
Don't come near me.

89
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:56,160
Young Master.

90
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:58,320
Let me help you remember

91
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,680
how you deceived this world
to become a scholar?

92
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:03,040
Let go of me!

93
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:04,160
I don't know you.

94
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,080
Back then, I was stuck in a brothel.

95
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:10,160
You passed by the building on a horse.

96
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,240
<i>Riding on a horse,</i>
<i>so dashing and charming.</i>

97
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,320
<i>All the women were mesmerized.</i>

98
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,640
<i>I thought I had finally met a great man.</i>

99
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:37,640
<i>Your gaze…</i>

100
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,480
told me to give you my heart.

101
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,000
"Living in the mountains
and the valley is like a dream."

102
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,200
"A luxurious life is not necessarily
so remarkable."

103
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:01,960
That's a good poem.

104
00:09:07,520 --> 00:09:10,960
<i>I used to love writing poems.</i>

105
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:13,640
<i>But because I lived in a brothel,</i>

106
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,560
<i>I never went out.</i>

107
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:18,440
<i>Few people knew me.</i>

108
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,680
<i>I also didn't want to use poems</i>
<i>as a way to increase my value</i>

109
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,680
<i>and attract customers.</i>

110
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,200
<i>After I met you,</i>

111
00:09:29,080 --> 00:09:31,560
<i>I entrusted you with my silver</i>
<i>and my poems</i>

112
00:09:32,960 --> 00:09:34,960
<i>so that you could help me publish them.</i>

113
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:41,200
<i>After I gave you my poems,</i>

114
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,360
<i>I never heard about them again.</i>

115
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:46,840
Every time I asked,

116
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,080
you said that they were naive and ordinary

117
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:53,520
and claimed that no one liked them.

118
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,760
Until one day,

119
00:09:57,600 --> 00:09:59,480
I saw a poetry collection.

120
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:14,960
Someone!

121
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:17,280
Help!

122
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,080
Flipping through the pages…

123
00:10:19,160 --> 00:10:21,080
…I realized they were all my work.

124
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:23,280
But they were published under your name.

125
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:25,280
When you took my poems as your own

126
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:27,720
and earned the reputation
of a talented scholar,

127
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:29,480
did you ever feel guilty?

128
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:32,320
Help! Help!

129
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:34,520
Every one of Yunyi's
carefully crafted words

130
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,960
ended up becoming your glory.

131
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:39,320
You were so shameless back then.

132
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,200
Now, you're afraid?

133
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:45,920
Young Master, you have to give me
an explanation.

134
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,080
What explanation?

135
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:50,720
Who do you think you are?

136
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:54,720
You're just a nameless courtesan.

137
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:57,120
What's wrong?

138
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,800
Do you think it's that easy
to publish a poetry book?

139
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:01,080
If it were under your name,

140
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:03,680
your poetry would never be published.

141
00:11:05,960 --> 00:11:09,480
But that poetry collection
was written by me.

142
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,120
Written by you?

143
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,240
But it's not the poetry that they like.

144
00:11:21,640 --> 00:11:24,040
Poems by Xie Loubai

145
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,840
They like my name.

146
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,960
It doesn't matter
whether your poems are good or not.

147
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:31,320
In fact, you should thank me.

148
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:33,680
Otherwise, this poetry collection

149
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:36,240
would never have been published.

150
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:41,760
Young Master!

151
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:09,920
When you heard
about what happened to Yunyi,

152
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,560
not only did you feel no guilt,

153
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:15,280
but you even claimed
that she forced you to marry her.

154
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:18,600
However, because you refused,
she killed herself out of spite.

155
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:23,800
I didn't. You're lying!

156
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:28,600
Xie Loubai.

157
00:12:29,880 --> 00:12:31,720
You still won't admit it.

158
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:33,720
I can't believe it.

159
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,920
You gave Yunyi's item to me.

160
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:40,840
But there's something you don't know.

161
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,760
Yunyi is not an ordinary person.

162
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:47,720
Her spirit came from a century-old lamp.

163
00:12:57,840 --> 00:12:59,480
But her demonic power is weak.

164
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:02,280
She never dared to do evil.

165
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:05,600
You mean…

166
00:13:07,840 --> 00:13:09,400
she was a demon from the start?

167
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:11,480
Once the glass lamp went out,

168
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:14,280
I became my true form

169
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:17,400
and turned into this lantern.

170
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,200
Then, I waited until you lit up
this lantern again.

171
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,280
Young Master.

172
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:28,560
I kept this one last breath

173
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:30,760
so that I can see…

174
00:13:31,960 --> 00:13:34,160
what your fate will be…

175
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:40,720
…for deceiving the world.

176
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:51,840
Help!

177
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:54,640
I won't plagiarize anymore.
I won't do it anymore!

178
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:56,440
Help!

179
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
I won't plagiarize anymore!
I won't do it anymore!

180
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,880
Help!

181
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:05,680
All right, Yunyi.

182
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,640
Let's end it here.

183
00:14:12,280 --> 00:14:13,880
I know you have unfinished business.

184
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:16,680
That's why you appeared again.

185
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:19,920
But taking his life
isn't the best revenge.

186
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:21,840
Yunyi.

187
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:23,880
Someone asked me to tell you something.

188
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:28,560
What is it?

189
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:31,000
Instead of killing him,

190
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:33,720
we should expose his evil deeds
to the world.

191
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:37,520
Let him be disgraced
and despised by the world.

192
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:39,480
Let him watch

193
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,360
the reputation he stole
crumble down with his own eyes.

194
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,360
It's much more appropriate…

195
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,120
than letting him die.

196
00:14:50,960 --> 00:14:51,960
All right.

197
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:54,760
That's a good idea.

198
00:14:56,200 --> 00:14:58,320
You got this chance
because of the Bone Relic.

199
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,840
I'm afraid you're going to die soon.

200
00:15:06,360 --> 00:15:09,520
<i>I once longed to capture</i>
<i>the true love of the human world.</i>

201
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:12,120
<i>But didn't expect</i>
<i>the human heart to be like ice</i>

202
00:15:12,200 --> 00:15:13,880
<i>that attacks you with a piercing cold.</i>

203
00:15:14,960 --> 00:15:16,880
<i>The vows we made</i>

204
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:19,240
<i>were also gone with the wind.</i>

205
00:15:20,040 --> 00:15:21,440
Poetry is hard to find.

206
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:25,320
Without poetic meaning,
life is indeed boring.

207
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:30,600
Coming to this world…

208
00:15:31,720 --> 00:15:33,480
and having this experience…

209
00:15:34,600 --> 00:15:35,720
is more than enough.

210
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:57,800
Yun…

211
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:03,360
It seems that she's dead.

212
00:16:05,080 --> 00:16:06,440
She only wanted…

213
00:16:07,320 --> 00:16:09,600
Xie Loubai to get what he deserves.

214
00:16:10,400 --> 00:16:11,720
Since she has left now,

215
00:16:13,480 --> 00:16:15,440
I don't think she has any regrets left.

216
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:36,160
- Hypocrite!
- You darn hypocrite!

217
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:39,160
Apparently, Xie Loubai
and Lady Yunyi

218
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:41,360
were in a physically
intimate relationship.

219
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,960
He even took advantage of her trust,

220
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:45,920
took her manuscript as his own,

221
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,040
- and stole her poems.
- What a monster.

222
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:50,600
Lady Yunyi couldn't seek justice

223
00:16:50,680 --> 00:16:52,320
and died in resentment.

224
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:54,680
Last night,
at the Liu Manor banquet,

225
00:16:54,760 --> 00:16:56,920
his guilt crept up on him
and felt haunted by a demon.

226
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,720
In the end, he got so scared
that he went crazy.

227
00:16:59,800 --> 00:17:01,400
What a satisfying ending.

228
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,400
The more famous Lady Yunyi's poetry is,

229
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:06,680
the worse
Xie Loubai's reputation shall be.

230
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,320
That's how it should be.

231
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,120
Xie Loubai deserves to live
in Yunyi's shadow.

232
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,840
Sir, you're right.

233
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:20,080
That's why they say,
"What goes around comes around."

234
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:21,160
Yes, well said.

235
00:17:21,240 --> 00:17:25,720
Tai Chi Gate

236
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:29,120
Lady Wu Zhen.

237
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:30,760
Lady Wu Zhen.

238
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:36,000
Are we already here?

239
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:38,120
Lady Wu Zhen, mind your etiquette.

240
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,880
My lady, you should
come back home more often.

241
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:48,680
Stay away from Lady Hu Zhu.

242
00:17:48,760 --> 00:17:50,920
Otherwise,
she'll be a bad influence on you.

243
00:17:52,240 --> 00:17:54,200
Why is my sister looking for me?

244
00:17:54,280 --> 00:17:56,440
It's about your marriage, of course.

245
00:17:57,720 --> 00:17:59,280
I knew it.

246
00:17:59,880 --> 00:18:01,200
These past few days,

247
00:18:01,280 --> 00:18:04,520
I've read Young Master Mei's paper
several times.

248
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,480
Mei Zhuyu
is indeed a talented man.

249
00:18:09,560 --> 00:18:11,440
His mindset and stature

250
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:14,560
are different from the young masters
from rich families.

251
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:18,840
Those young men only care
about the prosperity of Chang'an.

252
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:22,000
They shut their eyes and ears
to the suffering of the world.

253
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:25,000
They also avoid bizarre incidents.

254
00:18:25,080 --> 00:18:26,680
None of them expected

255
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:30,200
the hidden danger behind all the splendor.

256
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:36,440
So…

257
00:18:36,920 --> 00:18:38,560
What do you mean by all this?

258
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:45,200
What I mean is,
Young Master Mei is quite capable.

259
00:18:45,560 --> 00:18:47,200
You're interested in him,

260
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,120
and fate seems to be
bringing you together.

261
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,080
You should try to get to know him.

262
00:18:51,160 --> 00:18:52,880
Why are you giving up so quickly?

263
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,680
Didn't you ask Mingzhuang to tell me

264
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:56,960
that we aren't suitable?

265
00:18:57,040 --> 00:18:58,760
Why are you changing your mind now?

266
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:01,200
I…

267
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:02,680
Did I say that?

268
00:19:02,760 --> 00:19:03,760
Yes.

269
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:06,440
Or maybe not.

270
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:15,080
Zhen'er and I have been fighting
for 20 years.

271
00:19:15,160 --> 00:19:17,000
We've always gone against each other.

272
00:19:17,080 --> 00:19:18,600
We've never been on the same side.

273
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,440
Why are you so obedient this time?

274
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,800
So am I wrong for being obedient?

275
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:26,480
Your Majesty is so hard to please.

276
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,440
Hard to please?

277
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:30,720
Who's hard to please?

278
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:32,880
Your Majesty!

279
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,840
- Yes.
- Your Majesty, look.

280
00:19:34,920 --> 00:19:36,360
You've spoiled her too much.

281
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,600
What does that have to do with me?

282
00:19:38,680 --> 00:19:39,680
It's you!

283
00:19:40,120 --> 00:19:41,960
Every now and then, you give her new toys.

284
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,280
Look at how spoiled she is.

285
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,400
She's fickle, ungrateful,

286
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:49,880
and plays with people's hearts.

287
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:53,480
Your Majesty, don't be angry.

288
00:19:53,560 --> 00:19:55,440
If Lady Wu Zhen doesn't like him,

289
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:57,480
it must be my distant cousin's fault.

290
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:00,480
If she's this picky,
no one will be good enough for her.

291
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:02,400
She might as well go
and marry an immortal!

292
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:05,200
Where are you going, my dear Empress?

293
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:09,760
Consort Mei.

294
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:17,040
Here.

295
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,840
Are you all numb from kneeling?

296
00:20:21,240 --> 00:20:22,240
Mm.

297
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:26,640
Zhen'er.

298
00:20:27,320 --> 00:20:28,400
You've suffered a lot.

299
00:20:28,920 --> 00:20:30,680
- Your Majesty.
- Hmm.

300
00:20:31,080 --> 00:20:32,280
You've suffered a lot, too.

301
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,480
To be honest,

302
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,680
I'm on your side.

303
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,640
Mm.

304
00:20:45,160 --> 00:20:48,760
After all, getting married is no fun.

305
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:51,760
I'm a living example.

306
00:20:52,600 --> 00:20:53,600
Is that so?

307
00:20:54,680 --> 00:20:55,880
Look at them.

308
00:20:56,200 --> 00:20:57,360
Look at them.

309
00:20:57,440 --> 00:20:58,760
They get along quite well.

310
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:05,560
They're inseparable.

311
00:21:06,840 --> 00:21:09,880
But what about me?
I have no one to eat with.

312
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:12,680
I might as well be free
and live on my own.

313
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,120
Sometimes, I wonder

314
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,880
why I even married them.

315
00:21:21,760 --> 00:21:22,800
Marrying them is great!

316
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:46,560
The lantern has dispersed now.

317
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:49,360
Where will the Bone Relic go?

318
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:51,160
When I went to the study that day,

319
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:53,800
the Bone Relic
was no longer in the lantern.

320
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:58,520
Now that it's gone, what should we do?

321
00:22:00,120 --> 00:22:02,160
Xiaozhen, think about it carefully.

322
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:04,240
Who could have taken the Bone Relic?

323
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:08,720
Could it be Mei Zhuyu?

324
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:11,760
Why would he take it?

325
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:16,040
Did the Bureau of Mystic Investigations
take it as evidence to solve the case?

326
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:18,840
We can't let the Four Factions
know about this.

327
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:22,320
Otherwise, those old demons
will stir up trouble again.

328
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:24,800
It's too late.

329
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:30,040
The elders already know about it.

330
00:22:30,120 --> 00:22:31,560
How did they find out?

331
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:36,120
Elder Hui

332
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:37,880
Elder Jin

333
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,840
Elder Zi

334
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:43,360
When I went to the hot spring to bathe,

335
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:46,120
I ran into the Rat Demon
from the Hui Faction, Qishi.

336
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:49,000
We chatted while we were
in the hot spring together.

337
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,400
I accidentally let it slip.

338
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:53,240
You can talk nonsense all you want,

339
00:22:53,920 --> 00:22:55,480
but how dare you speak about this?

340
00:22:55,560 --> 00:22:59,320
They were just chatting.

341
00:22:59,880 --> 00:23:03,680
Why are you so angry, Snake Lord?

342
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:07,640
The Shadow Demon matter is over.

343
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,840
But Cat Lord…

344
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:13,680
never mentioned the problem
with the Bone Relic to us.

345
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:18,320
What? Are you disrespecting
the Four Factions' supervision now?

346
00:23:19,520 --> 00:23:20,640
Elder Hui.

347
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:23,800
I'm sure Cat Lord wouldn't do that.

348
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:26,840
Maybe she has just been busy with work.

349
00:23:26,920 --> 00:23:28,440
That's right, Elder Hui.

350
00:23:30,040 --> 00:23:31,560
You're overthinking it.

351
00:23:32,120 --> 00:23:34,360
I didn't tell the Four Factions about this

352
00:23:34,440 --> 00:23:37,560
because I originally wanted
to find the Bone Relic first

353
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:38,880
before informing everyone.

354
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,600
The Bone Relic is nothing unusual.

355
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,440
There are many grudgeful creatures
in the world.

356
00:23:44,520 --> 00:23:46,440
The occasional appearance
of an Bone Relic

357
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,280
is not something to be surprised about.

358
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,800
Since both of you

359
00:23:51,880 --> 00:23:54,760
think so lightly of an Bone Relic,

360
00:23:54,840 --> 00:23:57,320
then I suppose bringing it back
to Demon Underworld

361
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,120
will be a piece of cake.

362
00:24:00,200 --> 00:24:02,440
I've already started looking for it.

363
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,160
Actions speak louder than words.

364
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:08,320
Why don't we set a time limit?

365
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:12,640
If Cat Lord doesn't bring back
the Bone Relic,

366
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,600
we'll have to settle all old scores…

367
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,400
with you.

368
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:19,040
Elder Hui.

369
00:24:21,480 --> 00:24:22,480
All right.

370
00:24:23,600 --> 00:24:24,600
I promise you.

371
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,320
Within five days,

372
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:32,280
I'll surely bring
the Bone Relic to you.

373
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:40,280
It's a deal.

374
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:52,760
Lord Shu.

375
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:58,200
Lord Shu.

376
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,440
What's wrong?

377
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,320
Huh?

378
00:25:04,520 --> 00:25:05,920
Are you angry?

379
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:09,680
I had no other choice but to do this.

380
00:25:09,760 --> 00:25:11,920
It's my duty.

381
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:13,680
- Otherwise--
- I've said it before.

382
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:16,760
I hate those who oppose her the most.

383
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,400
You're funny, Lord Shu.

384
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:21,920
I don't like jokes.

385
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:25,120
You know that.

386
00:25:27,920 --> 00:25:29,120
Qishi.

387
00:25:29,200 --> 00:25:31,440
So how's that matter going?

388
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,200
It's my fault.

389
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:44,120
There's so much work in the city,

390
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:46,040
yet, she has to find
the Bone Relic now.

391
00:25:46,120 --> 00:25:47,840
I wonder if Cat Lord can handle it.

392
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:50,560
- Why don't I help her?
- There's no need.

393
00:25:51,880 --> 00:25:52,880
She has me.

394
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:12,680
I've asked someone to investigate.

395
00:26:12,760 --> 00:26:15,760
There's no trace of the Bone Relic
in the Bureau of Mystic Investigations,

396
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,880
Mei Si's residence, or the Liu manor.

397
00:26:17,960 --> 00:26:20,080
There's only Mei Zhuyu left then.

398
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:45,080
Lady Wu, why are you here?

399
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,280
To see you, of course.

400
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:50,160
Do you think

401
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,160
I came all the way here to admire flowers?

402
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,680
Why are you here to see me?

403
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:01,240
I'm mesmerized by your beauty.
I couldn't control myself.

404
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:08,240
I know it's your day off,
so I came to play with you.

405
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:12,200
I didn't expect the road
in front of your house to be so lousy.

406
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:14,480
On my way here,

407
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:16,600
I sprained my ankle
and my shoes got dirty.

408
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:18,200
What should I do now?

409
00:27:18,960 --> 00:27:20,040
Which ankle did you sprain?

410
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,120
Hmm?

411
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:36,520
The bones are fine.

412
00:27:37,440 --> 00:27:38,520
Do you know medicine?

413
00:27:38,600 --> 00:27:39,880
A little.

414
00:27:41,680 --> 00:27:43,640
You're not just handsome,

415
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:44,720
you're talented too.

416
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:48,760
Since Lady Wu is fine now,

417
00:27:48,840 --> 00:27:50,520
- then--
- I'll go in and rest for a bit.

418
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:51,680
Wait!

419
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:54,680
Do you know how to cook?

420
00:27:54,760 --> 00:27:55,840
Hmm…

421
00:28:00,520 --> 00:28:02,040
Your Highness, what would you like to eat?

422
00:28:02,960 --> 00:28:04,360
- Anything.
- Please come in.

423
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,640
Focus on one thing

424
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,680
<i>The house doesn't look big.</i>

425
00:28:14,280 --> 00:28:15,400
<i>Where exactly is it?</i>

426
00:28:23,800 --> 00:28:25,520
Focus on one thing

427
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:40,080
Young Master.

428
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:43,480
I think Her Highness is serious about you.

429
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:44,800
Don't talk nonsense.

430
00:28:45,800 --> 00:28:47,600
Lady Wu is just having some fun.

431
00:28:48,520 --> 00:28:49,920
She won't come here every day.

432
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:08,280
Why is it you again?

433
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,960
I was just passing by, so I came to eat.

434
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:13,240
You, no…

435
00:29:13,320 --> 00:29:14,440
Lady Wu.

436
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,440
You keep coming to my house.

437
00:29:17,520 --> 00:29:18,640
It's inappropriate.

438
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:21,400
If others see you,
it will ruin your reputation.

439
00:29:22,000 --> 00:29:23,120
Don't worry.

440
00:29:23,960 --> 00:29:25,080
You're not that popular.

441
00:29:25,160 --> 00:29:26,160
No one saw me.

442
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:28,240
I already have a bad reputation.

443
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:30,000
It can't get any worse.

444
00:29:42,680 --> 00:29:44,120
Eat up.

445
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:52,440
Young Master.

446
00:29:52,520 --> 00:29:55,360
I heard that you're very knowledgeable,
so I came to learn from you.

447
00:29:58,800 --> 00:30:00,960
Wenhua, prepare the utensils.

448
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:05,040
Gifts are here!

449
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,120
This is Ruyi House's new wine.

450
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:08,200
What took you so long?

451
00:30:08,280 --> 00:30:10,360
We've been waiting for you. Give it to me.

452
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:43,280
Lady Wu, how did you get in?

453
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,680
I climbed over the wall.

454
00:30:46,200 --> 00:30:49,400
<i>I've been searching for days,</i>
<i>but I still can't find the Bone Relic.</i>

455
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:51,840
<i>Could it be on him?</i>

456
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,680
Young Master.

457
00:31:15,080 --> 00:31:18,120
You may look like a weak scholar,

458
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:21,920
but you're actually quite strong.

459
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,240
What are you doing?

460
00:31:40,600 --> 00:31:43,080
Young Master, you have such a slim waist.

461
00:31:48,360 --> 00:31:49,720
Wu Zhen.

462
00:31:49,800 --> 00:31:51,840
Have you really been going
Little Zhuyu's house

463
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,040
to eat every day?

464
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:55,080
I'm sure you have other intentions.

465
00:31:55,800 --> 00:31:57,440
I've been going there to see him.

466
00:31:57,520 --> 00:31:59,040
I just stay for a meal out of convenience.

467
00:32:01,680 --> 00:32:03,480
I don't know where your Little Zhuyu

468
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,520
found his servant,
but he's quite a good cook.

469
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:09,760
Outside Chang'an.

470
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,880
On my way back to Chang'an,

471
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:14,160
I ran into a group of brokers
leaving the city.

472
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:15,240
Wenhua was among them.

473
00:32:16,320 --> 00:32:19,600
He lost his family, but he didn't want
to leave as he grew up in Chang'an.

474
00:32:19,960 --> 00:32:21,600
So I bought him and brought him back.

475
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,720
That way, we could
take care of each other.

476
00:32:24,560 --> 00:32:26,360
He has taken good care of you.

477
00:32:27,360 --> 00:32:30,280
You have a joyful glow on your face.

478
00:32:35,680 --> 00:32:38,320
A joyful glow?

479
00:32:38,400 --> 00:32:40,680
I don't think that has anything
to do with Wenhua.

480
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:46,200
Wenhua went to tie up the carriage.

481
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:48,320
I'll go ask the waiter for some tea.

482
00:32:54,400 --> 00:32:56,840
Why are you treating us to a meal today?

483
00:32:57,880 --> 00:32:58,920
Wu Zhen.

484
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:00,960
We haven't seen you for days.

485
00:33:01,040 --> 00:33:03,280
Besides, what's with you two?

486
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,760
Not only are you eating free meals
at his house,

487
00:33:05,840 --> 00:33:07,920
but you even asked Father
to look after him.

488
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:11,280
You haven't really fallen
for Little Zhuyu, have you?

489
00:33:11,840 --> 00:33:13,960
Young Master is good-looking.

490
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:16,000
Why can't I like him?

491
00:33:16,840 --> 00:33:18,760
You two are not a good match.

492
00:33:19,920 --> 00:33:21,680
Why do you say that?

493
00:33:21,760 --> 00:33:24,440
Look. Given the status
of the Empress and Duke Wu,

494
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:27,040
they must want you to find a man
who's from a noble family

495
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:28,160
or a prestigious family.

496
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,440
My younger cousin has no money, no power,

497
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:31,840
and no ambition.

498
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:33,000
Of course, he's not suitable.

499
00:33:34,040 --> 00:33:36,120
I don't care
if he's from the imperial family

500
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:37,480
or a prestigious family.

501
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,560
The world is so big.

502
00:33:39,640 --> 00:33:42,480
Not everyone is obsessed
with fame and fortune.

503
00:33:42,560 --> 00:33:44,840
The people and all living things

504
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:47,040
have their own way of surviving.

505
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:48,640
Look at Young Master Mei.

506
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:52,520
Everyone thinks he is powerless
and out of tune with the world.

507
00:33:53,640 --> 00:33:55,160
But I admire him.

508
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:58,000
<i>He never succumbs to power.</i>

509
00:33:58,320 --> 00:34:00,920
<i>He doesn't fawn over his superiors.</i>

510
00:34:01,920 --> 00:34:04,280
He never tries to please me
because of my status.

511
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,840
<i>He also doesn't turn his back</i>
<i>on me when I'm being difficult.</i>

512
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:11,560
<i>He's not interested in love,</i>

513
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,400
and he doesn't care about money or power.

514
00:34:16,000 --> 00:34:18,440
Come to think of it,
you're right.

515
00:34:19,080 --> 00:34:20,440
When I look at him…

516
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:24,600
…it feels like he's a lonely beast.

517
00:34:26,680 --> 00:34:28,680
In a world that doesn't belong to him,

518
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,000
he insists on sticking to his beliefs.

519
00:34:32,080 --> 00:34:33,400
His beliefs?

520
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,120
Xiaosi.

521
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,400
Due to our backgrounds,

522
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:40,840
we're used to seeing
the greediness in this world.

523
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,120
Hmm.

524
00:34:42,200 --> 00:34:44,240
But he's so pure and honest
that it's ridiculous.

525
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:47,560
Do you know what he said?

526
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:49,200
Huh?

527
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:51,240
"Eliminate the tyrants
and protect the people.

528
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,160
- <i>Rid evil by supporting justice."</i>
- Rid evil by supporting justice.

529
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:55,080
It's the same no matter where we do it.

530
00:34:55,160 --> 00:34:57,080
We just have to do our jobs.

531
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:00,520
<i>He just wants to do his duty.</i>

532
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,640
It's only natural to like

533
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,640
a charming young man like him.

534
00:35:09,480 --> 00:35:11,200
But his life is so lonely.

535
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:13,640
I told you to take care of him

536
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,440
to bring some warmth into his life.

537
00:35:18,840 --> 00:35:20,280
I had no idea…

538
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:22,960
that you're just like me.

539
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:24,960
You're a romantic.

540
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:38,400
Liu Manor

541
00:36:03,880 --> 00:36:05,200
Isn't he handsome?

542
00:36:08,520 --> 00:36:09,520
I'm sorry, everyone.

543
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:10,880
I'm late.

544
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:13,880
I didn't expect the demons
in the Liu manor to be so powerful.

545
00:36:13,960 --> 00:36:15,360
Please tell Lady Liu…

546
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:17,080
…not to worry.

547
00:36:17,160 --> 00:36:18,960
I'm here to save her today.

548
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:20,520
What demons?

549
00:36:20,600 --> 00:36:21,880
Our manor is very peaceful.

550
00:36:22,600 --> 00:36:25,400
You're the one who keeps coming
to pester our lady.

551
00:36:25,480 --> 00:36:27,800
- It's inappropriate.
- Don't try to hide it from me.

552
00:36:27,880 --> 00:36:30,120
I saw everything.

553
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:34,840
Mei Si.

554
00:36:34,920 --> 00:36:36,680
What's all this nonsense?

555
00:36:37,400 --> 00:36:39,080
My manor is very peaceful.

556
00:36:39,160 --> 00:36:40,440
I'm healthy too.

557
00:36:41,040 --> 00:36:42,960
Now that you've seen it for yourself,

558
00:36:43,040 --> 00:36:45,880
- please leave.
- No, I don't believe you.

559
00:36:46,440 --> 00:36:49,800
If there's nothing wrong,
why are you talking to me from afar?

560
00:36:52,040 --> 00:36:53,680
There must be something going on.

561
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,320
I won't leave so easily.

562
00:36:55,880 --> 00:36:57,280
I got these from the temple.

563
00:36:57,360 --> 00:36:59,680
I'll ward off evil for you!

564
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:03,440
I'm here.

565
00:37:15,040 --> 00:37:16,040
Release the dogs.

566
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:28,760
Boss, the time limit set
by the Four Factions is almost up.

567
00:37:28,840 --> 00:37:30,080
Did you find the Bone Relic?

568
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:32,080
Have some water.

569
00:37:35,160 --> 00:37:36,520
Found it.

570
00:37:36,600 --> 00:37:38,680
It's indeed easy to miss things
under our noses.

571
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,960
The Bone Relic we've been looking for
is actually on him.

572
00:37:43,240 --> 00:37:44,720
He carries it with him?

573
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:46,920
Young Master Mei is just a mortal.

574
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:49,480
Yet, he wasn't tempted
by the Bone Relic?

575
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,600
I'm not sure either.

576
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:54,080
No matter what, we have to
get it back as soon as possible.

577
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:55,640
We might as well go all out.

578
00:37:55,720 --> 00:37:57,840
- I'll just knock him out.
- You can't do that.

579
00:37:58,400 --> 00:37:59,760
He's from the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations.

580
00:37:59,840 --> 00:38:01,040
He's very cautious.

581
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:02,640
We have to be careful.

582
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:04,920
Don't worry about
the Four Factions.

583
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,360
So what if we can't get it back?

584
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,200
Even if they cause a commotion,
I'll hold up the sky for you.

585
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:15,280
What are you doing?

586
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,520
Ling Xiao mentioned
the hot spring last time.

587
00:38:17,600 --> 00:38:19,640
I'm thinking that
if the ingredients are right,

588
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:22,240
could it be that the method
of taking the medicine was wrong?

589
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,080
You don't want me
to take a medicinal bath, do you?

590
00:38:25,160 --> 00:38:27,040
You know me so well, Xiaozhen.

591
00:38:28,680 --> 00:38:31,640
I'm planning to explore the method
of medicinal baths.

592
00:38:36,760 --> 00:38:39,080
- I think I have an idea.
- Knock him out.

593
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:41,080
It seems…

594
00:38:42,040 --> 00:38:44,560
you can only get one's personal item
at a critical moment.

595
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:30,840
Who is it?

596
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:07,720
