00:01:27,154 --> 00:01:31,000
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 8)

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:38,661
(Demon Hunting Service)

4
00:01:50,712 --> 00:01:52,320
You are...

5
00:01:52,896 --> 00:01:54,145
Hu Zhu.

6
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,432
Yes. Lady Hu Zhu. What are you doing here?

7
00:01:58,761 --> 00:01:59,892
Did you just happen to pass by?

8
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:02,193
No. I came here looking for you.

9
00:02:02,440 --> 00:02:03,747
You are looking for me?

10
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:35,233
Wretched demon, reveal yourself and face your doom!

11
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:48,306
What are you doing?

12
00:02:52,176 --> 00:02:53,306
I'm just testing it.

13
00:03:01,849 --> 00:03:03,124
Lady Hu Zhu.

14
00:03:03,272 --> 00:03:05,829
Are you sure that demon is hiding here?

15
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,020
Yes.

16
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,313
Many wild cats have been gathering at this ancestral hall lately.

17
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:13,472
Even house cats are coming here.

18
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:16,872
They keep meowing every day. It's very creepy.

19
00:03:18,719 --> 00:03:20,152
No one lives here.

20
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:21,592
And this place is so run-down.

21
00:03:21,800 --> 00:03:23,455
What's so strange about having a few cats here?

22
00:03:24,095 --> 00:03:25,241
You call these

23
00:03:26,336 --> 00:03:27,609
a few cats?

24
00:03:32,241 --> 00:03:33,312
You are right.

25
00:03:36,455 --> 00:03:37,969
(The abnormality is right in front of him.)

26
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:39,952
(But he hasn't noticed at all.)

27
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:48,752
Lady Hu Zhu. If you are scared, you can go back first.

28
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:50,601
I can wait for the demon to show up by myself.

29
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,432
Why should I be afraid when you are here?

30
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,961
I can tell that you are a powerful and experienced master.

31
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:00,754
No demon can escape your grasp.

32
00:04:01,719 --> 00:04:03,752
Don't say that. I can't sense a demon if it's far away.

33
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:06,792
But if it's within one mile, I'm sure I can sense it.

34
00:04:07,711 --> 00:04:08,828
Really?

35
00:04:08,919 --> 00:04:10,953
And I can kill it

36
00:04:11,199 --> 00:04:12,712
within ten steps.

37
00:04:13,224 --> 00:04:14,696
What if the demon

38
00:04:15,520 --> 00:04:17,152
is right in front of you?

39
00:04:19,240 --> 00:04:20,593
No demon

40
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,832
can reach me.

41
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,153
What if some demons are so powerful

42
00:04:30,721 --> 00:04:32,274
that they can conceal themselves very well?

43
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:38,312
It doesn't matter.

44
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,192
Let me show you some tools.

45
00:04:45,791 --> 00:04:46,868
All these years,

46
00:04:46,959 --> 00:04:49,625
people have been saying that the Arcane Appraisal Bureau

47
00:04:49,715 --> 00:04:50,830
doesn't do anything.

48
00:04:50,920 --> 00:04:52,609
Now, Brother Mei

49
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:55,993
has made us proud.

50
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:10,458
Brother Nie Li.

51
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:12,473
I thought you went to relay Brother Mei's message

52
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,593
to Her Highness.

53
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,673
What is it? Do you have some fresh gossip again?

54
00:05:20,032 --> 00:05:22,913
Something interesting has actually happened on the street.

55
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:26,113
An idiot from nowhere came running out

56
00:05:26,199 --> 00:05:27,593
and started playing with his sword.

57
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,312
And he called himself a demon hunter.

58
00:05:39,679 --> 00:05:42,596
I'm the disciple in my sect with the most artifacts.

59
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:44,873
So, I can definitely catch that demon.

60
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:46,145
Toys...

61
00:05:46,959 --> 00:05:48,072
So many artifacts.

62
00:05:49,088 --> 00:05:50,840
But after all, a demon

63
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,553
is vicious, cunning, and has a repulsive appearance.

64
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,797
If I get into a fight with the demon later,

65
00:05:55,952 --> 00:05:58,473
I'm afraid that you'll get hurt. So, it's better for you to leave first.

66
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,512
Master Shuang Jiang.

67
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:04,832
Are you saying

68
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:07,432
that other than being evil,

69
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:08,957
demons are ugly too?

70
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,192
- Of course.   - Why am I told that some demons are beautiful?

71
00:06:12,399 --> 00:06:14,402
For example, the fox demon that is mentioned in books.

72
00:06:14,527 --> 00:06:16,004
Aren't they charming and beautiful?

73
00:06:16,159 --> 00:06:18,193
You are very wrong, Lady Hu Zhu.

74
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,994
That's just nonsense told by bored storytellers.

75
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,874
Even if it's the fox demon,

76
00:06:22,965 --> 00:06:24,758
look at the foxes in the wild.

77
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,192
They have the face of a rat, and they reek of body odor.

78
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,713
How can a demon transformed from a fox be beautiful?

79
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,233
Think about it. Am I not right?

80
00:07:11,519 --> 00:07:13,832
This place is too broken, Lady Hu Zhu.

81
00:07:17,439 --> 00:07:18,553
Lady Hu Zhu, be careful!

82
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,253
Thank you.

83
00:07:36,920 --> 00:07:38,872
Who is it? Who ambushed me?

84
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:44,153
You scared my friends away.

85
00:07:44,399 --> 00:07:45,713
This...

86
00:07:53,057 --> 00:07:54,279
That's the Futon Demon.

87
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,708
Master Shuang Jiang.

88
00:08:34,799 --> 00:08:36,332
Why aren't you using your Daoist Mystic Arts?

89
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:37,856
That's right.

90
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:41,392
Do you dare answer me when I call out to you?

91
00:08:41,483 --> 00:08:42,498
Sure.

92
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:45,299
What's your name again?

93
00:08:49,879 --> 00:08:50,953
Yes. Futon Demon.

94
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:52,412
Futon Demon!

95
00:08:56,559 --> 00:08:58,993
Master Shuang Jiang, you are amazing.

96
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,460
You managed to subdue the demon once you called out its name.

97
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:04,564
I subdued it?

98
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:07,627
I subdued it.

99
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:19,931
Don't be scared.

100
00:09:24,759 --> 00:09:25,883
Thank you, Lady Wu.

101
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:27,640
I'm...

102
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:28,956
There, now. Don't be scared.

103
00:09:29,039 --> 00:09:30,713
This man won't hurt you.

104
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:33,473
Why are you here, Lady Wu?

105
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:36,193
I should be asking you instead.

106
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:38,113
I sent someone to invite you for a drink.

107
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,353
Didn't you say that you were busy?

108
00:09:41,757 --> 00:09:43,713
I heard that someone hired my cousin to hunt down a demon.

109
00:09:43,799 --> 00:09:45,672
I was worried. So, I came to check on him.

110
00:09:48,024 --> 00:09:50,377
Your cousin is quite concerning.

111
00:09:54,935 --> 00:09:57,313
I was just playing with you. Don't worry.

112
00:09:58,519 --> 00:09:59,672
Hu Zhu told me

113
00:09:59,975 --> 00:10:01,573
that you were having a financial problem

114
00:10:01,664 --> 00:10:04,392
until Shuang Jiang had to start working on the street.

115
00:10:06,519 --> 00:10:08,552
And I found out from the bookkeeper of Ruyi Pavilion

116
00:10:08,815 --> 00:10:10,249
that this ancestral hall feels strange.

117
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:14,473
So, Hu Zhu went to hire Master Shuang Jiang to come here and take a look.

118
00:10:16,631 --> 00:10:17,799
I see.

119
00:10:19,159 --> 00:10:21,953
Then why are you here, Lady Wu?

120
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,073
You didn't accept my invite. I was bored.

121
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:30,752
So, I came here to join the fun.

122
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:38,048
Wait.

123
00:10:40,342 --> 00:10:41,815
This is for your own good.

124
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:44,353
There are many cats inside.

125
00:10:46,049 --> 00:10:47,872
It's okay. I'd better go in and check it out myself.

126
00:10:48,231 --> 00:10:49,545
Are you trying to evade me?

127
00:10:54,864 --> 00:10:56,142
I am.

128
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:07,288
The journey to the western suburbs was your official duty.

129
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:09,953
But I insisted on coming along.

130
00:11:10,377 --> 00:11:11,849
Not only did I not help you,

131
00:11:12,159 --> 00:11:13,672
but I also created trouble for you.

132
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,673
It was rude of me to do so.

133
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,633
If you feel uncomfortable around me,

134
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:25,579
I can

135
00:11:26,328 --> 00:11:27,841
stay away from you after this.

136
00:11:29,840 --> 00:11:31,073
It has nothing to do with you.

137
00:11:32,874 --> 00:11:34,187
It's my own issue.

138
00:11:39,048 --> 00:11:40,394
Your issue?

139
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:42,553
You weren't being rude.

140
00:11:43,862 --> 00:11:44,975
It was I who was not innocent.

141
00:11:48,799 --> 00:11:50,073
What do you mean?

142
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:55,601
In the past,

143
00:11:56,559 --> 00:11:58,272
I thought that I had a strong will

144
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,903
and would not be disturbed by external distractions.

145
00:12:01,112 --> 00:12:02,332
But now, I realized

146
00:12:03,071 --> 00:12:04,304
that I had overestimated myself.

147
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,167
In the end,

148
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:09,353
I'm just an ordinary man.

149
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:12,914
(They said that he requested this promotion.)

150
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,793
(Looks like he's a new official and is full of lofty ambitions.)

151
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:17,872
(But he can't help but be apprehensive.)

152
00:12:18,608 --> 00:12:20,793
In my opinion, there's no need for you

153
00:12:21,319 --> 00:12:22,753
to be so strict on yourself.

154
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,482
Don't have to be strict on myself?

155
00:12:28,473 --> 00:12:30,106
I once read this phrase when I was young.

156
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,720
The best way to nurture your mind is to curb your desires.

157
00:12:32,808 --> 00:12:34,041
But I don't believe in that.

158
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:35,510
What I believe in is,

159
00:12:38,679 --> 00:12:40,073
one can only live vividly

160
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,193
when he has desires.

161
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:49,486
Young Master.

162
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:53,353
You should chase after your desires.

163
00:13:03,399 --> 00:13:05,392
Brother Mei, I did it.

164
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:08,355
I subdued that demon.

165
00:13:08,751 --> 00:13:10,600
- You subdued that demon?   - Yes.

166
00:13:11,552 --> 00:13:12,945
I'm a great hunter now.

167
00:13:13,036 --> 00:13:15,313
Lady Hu Zhu saw everything. Ask her if you don't believe me.

168
00:13:17,929 --> 00:13:19,922
Yes. He was amazing.

169
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:23,600
I'm sorry. My cousin is quite reckless.

170
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:25,920
I'm glad that he didn't scare you.

171
00:13:29,679 --> 00:13:30,867
If that's the case,

172
00:13:31,240 --> 00:13:32,433
we'll take our leave now.

173
00:13:34,136 --> 00:13:35,190
Let's go.

174
00:13:38,623 --> 00:13:39,976
It was so dangerous just now.

175
00:13:40,103 --> 00:13:42,158
That demon was tiny but so strong.

176
00:13:42,249 --> 00:13:43,680
He could carry a huge beam.

177
00:13:44,088 --> 00:13:45,360
If I weren't agile enough,

178
00:13:45,656 --> 00:13:47,009
I would have gotten hurt.

179
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:49,143
But as you know, I'm a great hunter.

180
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:52,152
Why does Mr. Mei look so awkward?

181
00:13:53,919 --> 00:13:55,713
He's a young man who just became an official.

182
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:57,513
He just hasn't gotten used to it yet.

183
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,113
Everyone in Chang'an is praising him today.

184
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,512
But he can't get used to it yet?

185
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:08,593
Perhaps he's like a woman

186
00:14:09,008 --> 00:14:11,440
who broods for a few days once in a while.

187
00:14:15,559 --> 00:14:17,632
Let's not talk about him anymore. Tell me about Shuang Jiang.

188
00:14:18,863 --> 00:14:21,473
Let's not talk about him. He's just a waste of time.

189
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,233
Changxi Palace, they say?

190
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:25,632
He's just slightly better than the duke in catching a mosquito.

191
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:30,353
I think he met the same scammer as the duke.

192
00:14:30,864 --> 00:14:33,463
Since he's an amateur, we don't have to worry about him.

193
00:14:34,080 --> 00:14:35,349
Give him some money.

194
00:14:36,039 --> 00:14:37,313
We can rest assured

195
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:38,872
after completing this act with him.

196
00:14:39,919 --> 00:14:41,392
As for that little Futon Demon,

197
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:46,993
we can't just let him be.

198
00:14:49,335 --> 00:14:52,193
Don't be scared. I already chased that big man away.

199
00:14:53,487 --> 00:14:55,473
- So cute.   - Do you like cats so much?

200
00:14:58,159 --> 00:14:59,210
Shu.

201
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,912
Who are you? Let go of me!

202
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,552
It doesn't matter what kind of demon we are.

203
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:09,060
Who are you?

204
00:15:09,631 --> 00:15:11,989
Why did you lure so many cats into this ancestral hall?

205
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:13,433
Why should I tell you?

206
00:15:14,172 --> 00:15:15,392
Let me down at once!

207
00:15:16,440 --> 00:15:17,713
It's okay if you refuse to tell me.

208
00:15:18,680 --> 00:15:22,433
I love eating disobedient children.

209
00:15:24,679 --> 00:15:26,968
Okay. If he doesn't behave,

210
00:15:27,070 --> 00:15:28,512
we can split him between us.

211
00:15:28,603 --> 00:15:30,596
You can eat his flesh while I eat his bones.

212
00:15:31,145 --> 00:15:33,879
No. I'll tell you.

213
00:15:34,039 --> 00:15:35,433
I'll tell you the truth, okay?

214
00:15:41,640 --> 00:15:43,874
I used to be a futon spirit in this ancestral hall.

215
00:15:44,199 --> 00:15:46,192
In the past, this place was lively.

216
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:49,073
Many would come here every day to pray and make offerings.

217
00:15:49,319 --> 00:15:50,521
It was so fun.

218
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,212
But as time passes by, for reasons unknown,

219
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,473
people stopped coming here.

220
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:57,713
And this place became abandoned.

221
00:15:58,080 --> 00:15:59,637
I feel lonely.

222
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:01,872
So, I attracted the cats nearby to accompany me here.

223
00:16:02,919 --> 00:16:04,833
This place used to be popular.

224
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,073
Then, a Bodhisattva Pavilion was built outside the city.

225
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,552
Naturally, this place became deserted.

226
00:16:10,879 --> 00:16:11,917
From then on,

227
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:14,272
there's no longer any new stories for me,

228
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,993
and I have no one to talk to.

229
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:20,912
But they weren't talking to you either.

230
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:22,752
They were just praying.

231
00:16:23,311 --> 00:16:26,152
A small futon like you is just an object to be used.

232
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:28,752
What's there to miss about those days?

233
00:16:30,640 --> 00:16:31,954
I can't explain.

234
00:16:32,232 --> 00:16:35,064
Although it was quite painful every time

235
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:36,552
they knelt on me,

236
00:16:36,840 --> 00:16:38,353
I feel

237
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:40,876
that those days were much more interesting than now.

238
00:16:48,519 --> 00:16:50,993
You won't feel lonely when you are needed.

239
00:16:54,720 --> 00:16:55,764
Little kid.

240
00:16:56,320 --> 00:16:57,792
If you feel lonely,

241
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,237
how about you come with us?

242
00:16:59,328 --> 00:17:00,373
Where are we going?

243
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,619
The Demon Market.

244
00:17:02,799 --> 00:17:05,352
A place where you are needed.

245
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:40,891
I'm done eating.

246
00:17:41,839 --> 00:17:44,072
Brother Mei, what do you want to talk to me about?

247
00:17:50,617 --> 00:17:52,610
We only practice this when we are feeling restless.

248
00:17:53,121 --> 00:17:54,514
Why did you read it?

249
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:56,758
You never needed it in the past.

250
00:17:56,880 --> 00:17:57,967
I was just simply taking a look.

251
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:01,647
I'm looking for you

252
00:18:02,319 --> 00:18:03,752
because I have something to tell you.

253
00:18:04,896 --> 00:18:06,067
What is it?

254
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:08,193
As the Celestial Master,

255
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:11,272
I shouldn't stop you from hunting demons and eliminating evil.

256
00:18:12,599 --> 00:18:14,153
But Chang'an is not Quzhou.

257
00:18:14,416 --> 00:18:16,946
You'll cause trouble if you advertise it loudly in a bustling market.

258
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,712
Did I advertise it loudly?

259
00:18:20,983 --> 00:18:22,656
I think I was keeping quite a low profile.

260
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:28,713
Then I'll tone it down a little bit more.

261
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:31,500
But Brother Mei,

262
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:35,153
why does everyone in Chang'an say that the Changxi Palace is fake?

263
00:18:35,240 --> 00:18:37,673
And Changxi is always related to scammers.

264
00:18:38,104 --> 00:18:40,137
Changxi Palace was left empty after a century of seclusion.

265
00:18:40,432 --> 00:18:42,185
It's inevitable that some with ill intentions

266
00:18:42,561 --> 00:18:44,033
would exploit the name of the Changxi Palace

267
00:18:44,461 --> 00:18:45,541
to scam others.

268
00:18:45,632 --> 00:18:46,825
Why did we go into seclusion?

269
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:49,352
Although the living cost in Chang'an is high,

270
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,633
there are many people, demons, and jobs here.

271
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:54,112
We gave those bad people an opportunity to do evil.

272
00:18:54,983 --> 00:18:56,256
Our master once said

273
00:18:57,344 --> 00:19:00,456
that it wasn't Changxi Palace's intention to leave this place.

274
00:19:01,223 --> 00:19:02,656
We were chased out by demons.

275
00:19:03,439 --> 00:19:04,873
The demons in Chang'an

276
00:19:05,519 --> 00:19:06,913
bullied us and chased us away?

277
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:12,381
No. I have to take them down.

278
00:19:12,472 --> 00:19:13,675
Don't be reckless.

279
00:19:16,056 --> 00:19:17,151
Fine.

280
00:19:18,319 --> 00:19:20,673
We left the mountain to hunt demons and eliminate evil.

281
00:19:21,079 --> 00:19:23,552
I can't make a claim under my name after eliminating a demon.

282
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:24,741
It feels so unpleasant.

283
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,163
Did you hunt down demons to make a name for yourself?

284
00:19:29,281 --> 00:19:31,592
Yes. I'm different from you.

285
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:34,512
You have a few desires and don't care about fame.

286
00:19:34,599 --> 00:19:35,668
But I'm not.

287
00:19:35,759 --> 00:19:37,352
I took the path of cultivation

288
00:19:37,443 --> 00:19:38,876
to become a great hero.

289
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:40,672
I feel so stifled that no one knows

290
00:19:41,328 --> 00:19:42,401
the good deeds I've done.

291
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:44,318
Anyway,

292
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:46,104
I'm just a commoner like that.

293
00:19:48,695 --> 00:19:49,729
What I believe in is,

294
00:19:50,359 --> 00:19:51,552
one can only live vividly

295
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:54,272
when he has desires.

296
00:19:55,121 --> 00:19:56,239
Young Master.

297
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,713
You should chase after your desires.

298
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:16,545
Shu.

299
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,033
I feel like you are steaming some meat.

300
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,633
I smell like ginseng now.

301
00:20:27,720 --> 00:20:29,272
Does it have to be so hot?

302
00:20:30,519 --> 00:20:32,756
This medicinal bath will not yield the result you want at once.

303
00:20:32,839 --> 00:20:34,193
You have to take it step by step.

304
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:35,993
But don't worry.

305
00:20:36,200 --> 00:20:38,673
After going through this and transforming into a full demon,

306
00:20:39,559 --> 00:20:40,592
everything will get better.

307
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:44,379
Lord Shu.

308
00:20:55,576 --> 00:20:58,233
I told you not to disturb me.

309
00:20:59,039 --> 00:21:02,637
Lord Shu, a customer wishes to use the bath.

310
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,993
That's why I came to ask you about it.

311
00:21:05,359 --> 00:21:06,913
He can come back again.

312
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:10,356
That's improper.

313
00:21:10,478 --> 00:21:11,511
Improper?

314
00:21:13,320 --> 00:21:15,040
There is an error in the bathhouse accounts.

315
00:21:15,119 --> 00:21:16,873
You've broken the Demon Law.

316
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:19,713
The bathhouse will be closed down starting today.

317
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,434
Do you still want to take a bath?

318
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,910
No. What are you talking about? I never take a bath.

319
00:21:26,001 --> 00:21:27,474
You...

320
00:21:30,319 --> 00:21:32,393
Keeper Mei.

321
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:33,624
Stand back!

322
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:36,267
Stop pushing!

323
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:38,012
Stand back!

324
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,798
Stop pushing!

325
00:21:42,152 --> 00:21:44,825
Keeper Mei.

326
00:22:06,039 --> 00:22:07,552
The province appreciates and rewards

327
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:09,752
outstanding talents.

328
00:22:13,480 --> 00:22:17,433
The keeper of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau, Mei Zhu Yu,

329
00:22:17,960 --> 00:22:19,393
is commended

330
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:21,393
for cracking a case.

331
00:22:22,200 --> 00:22:25,873
He'll be promoted as the Commissioner of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

332
00:22:26,503 --> 00:22:28,741
May you lead the bureau

333
00:22:28,832 --> 00:22:30,185
and serve the people by solving crimes

334
00:22:30,599 --> 00:22:32,512
and protect the city.

335
00:22:32,671 --> 00:22:34,305
The previous commissioner, Xu Luan,

336
00:22:35,160 --> 00:22:37,072
is advanced in age.

337
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:39,153
The duty as the commissioner is a burden too heavy for him.

338
00:22:39,873 --> 00:22:43,109
He has been granted permission to return to his homeland, Yongzhou,

339
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:45,753
to work as the governor of Yongzhou.

340
00:22:46,760 --> 00:22:48,833
May you lead the scholars of Yongzhou

341
00:22:49,160 --> 00:22:50,592
and nurture their talents

342
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,832
so that they can be of use to the imperial court one day.

343
00:22:53,640 --> 00:22:55,232
Keeper Mei has been promoted.

344
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:57,153
It hasn't been easy for him.

345
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:00,032
Congratulations, Keeper Mei.

346
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,552
- Congratulations.   - Yes.

347
00:23:05,279 --> 00:23:06,633
Keeper Mei has been promoted.

348
00:23:10,648 --> 00:23:14,032
Commissioner Mei, you are indeed young and capable.

349
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:22,440
- Let's go.   - What's wrong?

350
00:24:25,759 --> 00:24:26,970
Commissioner Mei.

351
00:24:27,080 --> 00:24:29,360
Commissioner Xu has kept so many items at the Arcane Appraisal Bureau

352
00:24:29,456 --> 00:24:30,469
over the years.

353
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:31,752
He's busy packing now.

354
00:24:31,880 --> 00:24:34,276
If he sees us, he'll probably ask us to help him.

355
00:24:34,359 --> 00:24:35,473
You are right.

356
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:37,393
We don't have time to do that.

357
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,633
Now that you've been promoted,

358
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,352
you've become more tactful.

359
00:25:10,319 --> 00:25:12,480
In terms of duty, there's nothing to say. But in private,

360
00:25:13,400 --> 00:25:14,752
I owe you an apology.

361
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:16,372
Forget it.

362
00:25:17,039 --> 00:25:19,393
You also referred me to Minister Liu

363
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:23,512
so that I can be the governor of YongZhou, right?

364
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,904
Speaking of it,

365
00:25:25,559 --> 00:25:27,352
you don't owe me anything.

366
00:25:31,760 --> 00:25:33,038
To be honest,

367
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,073
I had prepared so many words to reprimand you that day.

368
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:40,993
But after calming down and thinking about it,

369
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,797
you weren't wrong.

370
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:45,988
I was in charge of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau for years.

371
00:25:46,079 --> 00:25:48,993
But I had never done anything proper.

372
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:50,553
I knew how others

373
00:25:50,889 --> 00:25:53,720
cursed me and complained about me behind my back.

374
00:25:53,811 --> 00:25:54,909
And I didn't care.

375
00:25:55,928 --> 00:25:56,988
Put it there.

376
00:25:58,200 --> 00:25:59,246
Meanwhile,

377
00:25:59,823 --> 00:26:00,889
you are young.

378
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:02,913
Not only are you talented,

379
00:26:03,400 --> 00:26:05,913
but you also have the passion to serve the country.

380
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,552
It was too much of a waste for you

381
00:26:08,359 --> 00:26:09,792
to work at the Records Vault.

382
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,392
I merely fulfilled my duty.

383
00:26:17,519 --> 00:26:18,524
Your duty.

384
00:26:22,640 --> 00:26:24,153
It's easier said

385
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:26,112
than done.

386
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:31,356
When I was young,

387
00:26:31,447 --> 00:26:33,000
I excelled in the imperial examination too.

388
00:26:33,191 --> 00:26:34,541
I managed to make my way into Chang'an.

389
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:36,473
I was brimming with ambition and pride.

390
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,112
I wanted to serve the country, the people

391
00:26:38,696 --> 00:26:40,209
and fulfilled my duty.

392
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:42,032
But in the end,

393
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:46,514
I'm just left with a tarnished reputation.

394
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:55,816
Eighteen years ago,

395
00:26:56,920 --> 00:26:58,393
Chang'an fell into the Divine Fire Chaos.

396
00:26:59,240 --> 00:27:00,393
You were still young back then.

397
00:27:01,039 --> 00:27:02,752
I'm sure you've never seen something like that.

398
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,914
Everything was wiped out.

399
00:27:07,784 --> 00:27:11,496
I investigated that case with my best friend.

400
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:14,385
We came from the same homeland.

401
00:27:15,194 --> 00:27:16,352
And he was my classmate.

402
00:27:17,119 --> 00:27:19,032
Plus, we were both posted to Chang'an.

403
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:22,352
He told me gravely

404
00:27:22,680 --> 00:27:23,873
that the case was grotesque

405
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:26,552
and that I shouldn't investigate it too deeply.

406
00:27:27,319 --> 00:27:29,713
Otherwise, my life would be in danger.

407
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,792
I only found out later

408
00:27:39,359 --> 00:27:40,416
that Chang'an

409
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:43,113
is haunted.

410
00:27:44,599 --> 00:27:45,638
Haunted?

411
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:06,268
Back then,

412
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,993
I marked the locations of all the bizarre cases

413
00:28:10,240 --> 00:28:12,154
on this map.

414
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:18,651
I thought to myself

415
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:23,032
that I would one day solve these cases one by one.

416
00:28:30,480 --> 00:28:32,473
But eventually, I found out

417
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:35,953
that Chang'an is a dangerous place.

418
00:28:37,599 --> 00:28:38,913
It's treacherous.

419
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,913
It's hard to explain it to others.

420
00:28:42,905 --> 00:28:46,752
Even the famous Changxi Palace was gone a century ago.

421
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:49,436
How can a mortal like me solve a bizarre case?

422
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:51,352
How can I fight against a demon?

423
00:28:52,839 --> 00:28:54,913
I'm not trying to make an excuse.

424
00:29:03,648 --> 00:29:05,081
This thing is too heavy.

425
00:29:06,783 --> 00:29:08,056
I can't take it with me.

426
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,512
It'll give it to you

427
00:29:13,119 --> 00:29:14,153
to remember me by.

428
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,159
This is yours now.

429
00:29:25,176 --> 00:29:26,428
Today is the beginning of the month.

430
00:29:26,519 --> 00:29:28,633
You've always wanted to enter the palace, right?

431
00:29:35,495 --> 00:29:38,409
May everything be smooth-sailing

432
00:29:39,541 --> 00:29:40,673
for you.

433
00:29:42,359 --> 00:29:43,433
Stay true to your heart.

434
00:30:45,759 --> 00:30:47,072
What are you looking for?

435
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:52,436
I am Mei Zhu Yu from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

436
00:30:52,519 --> 00:30:53,713
May I know who you are?

437
00:30:58,680 --> 00:31:00,713
The Archives Pavilion is located in the palace.

438
00:31:01,199 --> 00:31:02,793
In order to manage it better,

439
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:05,407
female officials have been sent here to take care of it.

440
00:31:06,303 --> 00:31:08,003
So, you are the official of the Archives Pavilion.

441
00:31:10,848 --> 00:31:12,440
So, you are

442
00:31:13,119 --> 00:31:16,473
the new commissioner of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau, Mei Zhu Yu.

443
00:31:17,559 --> 00:31:20,352
May I know what you are looking for?

444
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,305
I was sorting through the case files in the bureau.

445
00:31:23,687 --> 00:31:25,081
I noticed that one file is missing.

446
00:31:25,920 --> 00:31:27,873
According to the previous commissioner, Xu Luan,

447
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:31,032
that file was transferred into the palace and kept here.

448
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:32,673
So, I came here to look for it.

449
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,272
Looking for a file in the Archives Pavilion

450
00:31:36,759 --> 00:31:38,433
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

451
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,633
If you wanted to look for the file,

452
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:44,390
why didn't you ask the officials in the pavilion to help you out?

453
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,673
Wouldn't it be easier?

454
00:31:47,480 --> 00:31:49,393
There are still some unsolved cases at the bureau.

455
00:31:49,720 --> 00:31:51,032
Other than this file,

456
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,832
I want to check out some records too.

457
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:55,352
Instead of troubling them with it,

458
00:31:55,680 --> 00:31:56,992
it's better for me to do it myself.

459
00:31:57,400 --> 00:31:58,832
I don't understand.

460
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,953
If they are cases in the past,

461
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,623
why do you want to investigate them?

462
00:32:02,920 --> 00:32:04,473
It's just a missing case file.

463
00:32:04,839 --> 00:32:06,393
As the new commissioner,

464
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,153
do you have to come here personally to look for it?

465
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,433
Doesn't the Arcane Appraisal Bureau have something better to do?

466
00:32:26,120 --> 00:32:27,300
Consort Mei.

467
00:32:27,648 --> 00:32:29,921
Lady Wu Zhen, have you heard about it too?

468
00:32:30,552 --> 00:32:31,705
What is it?

469
00:32:32,049 --> 00:32:33,522
Aren't you going to the Archives Pavilion?

470
00:32:35,376 --> 00:32:37,369
I just had a game of chess with His Majesty.

471
00:32:38,160 --> 00:32:39,673
What happened, Consort Mei?

472
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:42,193
My cousin, Mei Zhu Yu, entered the palace today.

473
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:45,276
I heard that Her Majesty was rushing to the Archives Pavilion

474
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,433
to meet her.

475
00:32:47,359 --> 00:32:48,832
What is she trying to do again?

476
00:32:49,480 --> 00:32:50,873
She's so fierce.

477
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:53,153
I'm afraid that she'll scare him away.

478
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:58,880
To help the people, we should respect the spirits but keep our distance.

479
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,870
Our court established the Arcane Appraisal Bureau

480
00:33:01,007 --> 00:33:02,601
to solve mystery cases

481
00:33:02,692 --> 00:33:04,913
to protect the people and keep peace.

482
00:33:05,137 --> 00:33:06,922
As the commissioner of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau,

483
00:33:07,023 --> 00:33:08,980
it's my duty to find clues, solve mystery cases,

484
00:33:09,119 --> 00:33:11,557
uphold justice, and eliminate evil.

485
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:13,349
Moreover,

486
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:15,953
past cases can be useful to current cases too.

487
00:33:16,319 --> 00:33:17,462
Although the mystery cases

488
00:33:17,920 --> 00:33:19,473
often seem illogical,

489
00:33:20,039 --> 00:33:21,473
they always come with a goal.

490
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,600
If there's an unanswered question today,

491
00:33:23,683 --> 00:33:26,275
perhaps we can find the answer in the past.

492
00:33:26,759 --> 00:33:28,713
Take history as a mirror

493
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,520
to understand the rise and fall of the past.

494
00:33:31,001 --> 00:33:32,034
Take history as a mirror.

495
00:33:32,560 --> 00:33:33,754
Well said.

496
00:33:35,359 --> 00:33:36,953
I never thought that there would be

497
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,792
such a talented young man in Chang'an.

498
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,233
Based on your capability and mindset,

499
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:44,913
it's a waste for you to be just a minor commissioner

500
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:46,633
of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

501
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:51,473
I hold some power in the palace.

502
00:33:52,279 --> 00:33:53,792
I'm willing to help you

503
00:33:54,049 --> 00:33:55,726
get a better title.

504
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:57,083
Since we are all official,

505
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:59,967
no matter where I am, I should always do my best.

506
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:01,752
We are all officials.

507
00:34:01,839 --> 00:34:03,245
There's no such thing as overqualified.

508
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,473
You are right.

509
00:34:10,199 --> 00:34:11,712
I'm too narrow-minded.

510
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:15,273
This is my first time seeing you admit that you are wrong.

511
00:34:21,784 --> 00:34:23,737
Where's your sense of propriety?

512
00:34:25,239 --> 00:34:28,032
Sister, it's my fault for not raising him well.

513
00:34:28,240 --> 00:34:30,432
He must have offended you.

514
00:34:31,015 --> 00:34:32,127
It's fine.

515
00:34:32,559 --> 00:34:33,753
The ignorant are not guilty.

516
00:34:34,159 --> 00:34:36,273
Greetings, Your Majesty.

517
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:38,152
Greetings, Consort Mei.

518
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,072
Greetings, Princess Qing He.

519
00:34:41,167 --> 00:34:43,801
You are not nervous talking to me.

520
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:47,232
Maybe because I talked quite a bit with you just now.

521
00:34:47,559 --> 00:34:48,753
So, I'm not nervous.

522
00:34:50,679 --> 00:34:53,072
I didn't know that you would be such a smooth talker.

523
00:34:56,240 --> 00:34:57,992
You've been in Chang'an for a while now.

524
00:34:58,440 --> 00:35:00,273
But I haven't summoned you into the palace yet.

525
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:01,912
I've overlooked this matter.

526
00:35:02,087 --> 00:35:03,404
When you are free,

527
00:35:03,495 --> 00:35:06,088
you can enter the palace to talk to me.

528
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:09,632
Look at you.

529
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:11,313
Why did you enter the palace today?

530
00:35:11,753 --> 00:35:13,065
I miss you.

531
00:35:13,177 --> 00:35:14,569
You miss me?

532
00:35:15,519 --> 00:35:17,473
Did His Majesty ask you to play a game of cards

533
00:35:18,000 --> 00:35:19,152
or pitch-pot with him?

534
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:21,556
It was chess.

535
00:35:24,719 --> 00:35:26,192
I just played with him for a while.

536
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:27,672
Okay now.

537
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:29,433
Pay a visit to Yuan Zhen.

538
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:32,192
She has been feeling weak lately.

539
00:35:32,519 --> 00:35:34,753
She's bored staying inside the palace all day.

540
00:35:35,559 --> 00:35:37,672
She keeps asking for you.

541
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:41,433
Sure. Yuan Zhen will be happy to see me.

542
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:46,072
I'll take this man with me.

543
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:02,873
Your cousin is very interesting.

544
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:07,873
His every word hit home.

545
00:36:08,719 --> 00:36:11,112
He understood the founding purpose of

546
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:13,433
the Arcane Appraisal Bureau very thoroughly.

547
00:36:13,719 --> 00:36:16,473
He's neither servile nor overbearing.

548
00:36:17,639 --> 00:36:20,112
He is a good kid.

549
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:23,313
Thank you for your compliments.

550
00:36:23,639 --> 00:36:27,393
Zhen has chosen a great man this time.

551
00:36:31,480 --> 00:36:33,317
Aren't you here to visit Princess Yuan Zhen?

552
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,687
There's no need to send me off.

553
00:36:35,400 --> 00:36:38,032
I'm not sending you off. You are sending me off.

554
00:36:41,719 --> 00:36:42,838
I've arrived.

555
00:36:45,239 --> 00:36:47,353
Tong, the flower is like this again.

556
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,353
What's going on?

557
00:36:53,559 --> 00:36:54,639
Don't touch it.

558
00:36:57,480 --> 00:36:58,596
What's wrong?

559
00:36:59,880 --> 00:37:01,148
Your Highness.

560
00:37:01,239 --> 00:37:02,273
Look at this flower.

561
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:26,992
Your Highness, is it blood?

562
00:37:29,800 --> 00:37:31,031
It's just the nectar of the flower.

563
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:33,232
It just looks different.

564
00:37:34,519 --> 00:37:36,232
Who has been taking care of this plant lately?

565
00:37:46,975 --> 00:37:48,209
I'm here to accompany you.

566
00:37:48,329 --> 00:37:49,559
Are you still in pain today?

567
00:37:49,671 --> 00:37:52,225
No. Look. What is that?

568
00:37:52,384 --> 00:37:53,551
What is it?

569
00:37:55,671 --> 00:37:56,960
It's a woman.
