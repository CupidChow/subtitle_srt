1
00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:30,882
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,112 --> 00:01:34,018
(Episode 10)

3
00:01:39,124 --> 00:01:41,126
Boss, the protection array is ready.

4
00:02:00,454 --> 00:02:01,538
The portal is open.

5
00:02:01,638 --> 00:02:02,757
Get ready.

6
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,280
It's time.

7
00:03:05,039 --> 00:03:06,872
Are you Xuan Hui?

8
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,472
That's me.

9
00:03:32,759 --> 00:03:33,801
Kitty!

10
00:04:13,520 --> 00:04:15,953
(In the seventh year of Ren'an's reign, on New Year's Eve,)

11
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:19,872
(a great fire fell from the heavens, consuming half of Chang'an.)

12
00:04:21,839 --> 00:04:24,713
(The flames raged for three days and three nights.)

13
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,072
(Countless citizens of Chang'an were injured.)

14
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,872
(There were 1,069 casualties.)

15
00:04:37,959 --> 00:04:39,752
(There are many dubious points about this case.)

16
00:04:41,439 --> 00:04:44,913
(Firstly, a great fire suddenly fell onto Chang'an from the sky.)

17
00:04:45,244 --> 00:04:47,398
(It couldn't be extinguished with water, and no one knew why.)

18
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,632
(Secondly, the fire lasted three days.)

19
00:04:51,959 --> 00:04:53,473
(Although there were many casualties,)

20
00:04:53,839 --> 00:04:56,192
(less than half of them died from the fire.)

21
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,192
(When the coroners inspected their bodies, there were no wounds at all.)

22
00:05:02,391 --> 00:05:05,312
(Thirdly, after the yamen's inquiry,)

23
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:09,632
(they found out that a few villagers saw shadows of demons darting around.)

24
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:12,632
(When they asked them about the details, they dared not reply.)

25
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:16,233
(They later denied their testimony.)

26
00:05:17,032 --> 00:05:19,864
(All these events are highly irregular.)

27
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:21,392
(It might be the work of demons.)

28
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:26,272
(It's said that Chang'an has had a Demon Market since ancient times.)

29
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:29,632
(I suppose it's their doing.)

30
00:05:39,521 --> 00:05:40,639
Shu!

31
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:42,120
- Wu Zi Shu.   - Wu Zi Shu.

32
00:05:44,888 --> 00:05:46,027
What's wrong?

33
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:52,701
Shu!

34
00:05:55,399 --> 00:05:57,432
Lady Liu actually likes demons?

35
00:05:57,691 --> 00:06:01,320
That preference of hers is peculiar indeed.

36
00:06:02,759 --> 00:06:04,713
But do demons actually exist in this world?

37
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,432
I guess so. After all, I saw one at the Liu Residence before.

38
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:11,033
White Serpent loves to make things up. He should show me the real deal.

39
00:06:12,839 --> 00:06:13,839
Speak of the devil.

40
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:16,872
Is that another snake?

41
00:06:19,112 --> 00:06:20,143
This...

42
00:06:52,120 --> 00:06:53,760
- How is he?   - He's fine now.

43
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:56,832
He was just too agitated. A few days of rest will do.

44
00:06:57,928 --> 00:07:01,320
I suppose the scene was quite shocking. But Shu has always been composed.

45
00:07:02,399 --> 00:07:03,952
Why would he be shocked by such an event?

46
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,353
Lord Shu's original form is a book after all.

47
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,432
Perhaps he was afraid that the lightning might set him on fire.

48
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:14,993
After all, it was the remains of a Sinister Fiend. It has a sinister aura.

49
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,553
Ling Xiao, is there anything unusual about him?

50
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:23,335
I've already given him a diagnosis. There's no sign of sinister corrosion.

51
00:07:25,257 --> 00:07:26,570
Cat Lord summoned lightning today.

52
00:07:27,337 --> 00:07:28,530
She has expended a lot of energy.

53
00:07:29,287 --> 00:07:30,841
Luckily, this matter is over.

54
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,152
We can rest for a few days.

55
00:07:34,359 --> 00:07:35,752
I'm afraid not.

56
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,088
Why not?

57
00:07:37,399 --> 00:07:40,832
Boss, did you forget what day it is tomorrow?

58
00:07:43,800 --> 00:07:44,831
You mean the Lantern Festival?

59
00:07:47,208 --> 00:07:48,300
I'm not going.

60
00:07:53,480 --> 00:07:56,473
Are you saying that there's a Demon Market in Chang'an?

61
00:07:57,603 --> 00:07:58,843
I read that from the palace's secret records.

62
00:07:58,952 --> 00:08:00,664
I'm sure it's not a baseless speculation.

63
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,873
From now on, we have to be extra cautious.

64
00:08:03,184 --> 00:08:05,776
We'll have to find evidence to prove our speculation.

65
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:07,674
All right.

66
00:08:09,364 --> 00:08:11,677
But Brother Mei, where are you going?

67
00:08:12,759 --> 00:08:13,872
Today's the Lantern Festival.

68
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,712
Every clan member, together with the officials of the Six Departments,

69
00:08:15,833 --> 00:08:17,520
will head to the Imperial City to release sky lanterns.

70
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,153
Are you leaving me alone?

71
00:08:48,376 --> 00:08:50,215
I'm exhausted from all the work, yet you're just chilling.

72
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:52,280
It's pouring, you know? Why aren't you helping me out?

73
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,272
How dare you eat when you're not making a single cent?

74
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:56,872
Is it my fault that it's pouring out there?

75
00:08:57,412 --> 00:08:59,692
Besides, it's not like I don't want to make money.

76
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:01,640
But I have no other way to make a living.

77
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:02,752
You!

78
00:09:03,039 --> 00:09:04,152
Go and pour the bucket of water!

79
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:07,639
How dare you still eat? Put it down!

80
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:11,520
You...

81
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:14,073
Isn't this Little Fish's residence?

82
00:09:15,297 --> 00:09:16,391
Fourth Master Mei.

83
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,433
Wen Hua, I heard that there's a master from Changxi Palace here.

84
00:09:21,903 --> 00:09:22,981
That's not true.

85
00:09:24,689 --> 00:09:25,732
Why are you here?

86
00:09:25,799 --> 00:09:27,760
I heard that there's a master who can exorcise demons here.

87
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:29,313
Are you the master from Changxi Palace?

88
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:39,353
Indeed.

89
00:09:42,291 --> 00:09:44,545
(Duke Wu's Residence)

90
00:09:57,304 --> 00:09:58,557
Lady Wu Zhen.

91
00:09:59,601 --> 00:10:00,845
Lady Wu Zhen?

92
00:10:01,759 --> 00:10:03,912
Today's the Lantern Festival. You can't afford to sleep in.

93
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:05,473
It's time to wash up.

94
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:09,589
Lady Wu Zhen?

95
00:10:12,571 --> 00:10:13,812
It's almost the hour of Shen.

96
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:16,760
No matter what, you should wake up and have some food.

97
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,512
Her Majesty has arrived.

98
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,516
Lady Wu Zhen?

99
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,387
Your Highness.

100
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,552
Zhen, where are you going in such a hurry?

101
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:04,392
As the second daughter of Duke Wu and my only sister,

102
00:11:04,559 --> 00:11:07,912
you should set an example and act as a dignified lady.

103
00:11:08,159 --> 00:11:09,713
But look at you right now.

104
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:13,672
You're too "dignified" for your own good.

105
00:11:14,159 --> 00:11:16,953
Sister, don't be angry. It's good that Lady Wu Zhen is here.

106
00:11:17,975 --> 00:11:21,032
The Lantern Festival is only held annually.

107
00:11:21,240 --> 00:11:23,120
Naturally, you should come and make a wish.

108
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,872
Make a wish? That's just like scooping the moon's reflection in the water.

109
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:28,713
Such wishful thinking.

110
00:11:28,799 --> 00:11:29,912
Wishful thinking?

111
00:11:33,759 --> 00:11:36,632
You were in a coma for three months when you were young.

112
00:11:36,919 --> 00:11:38,473
I made a wish to the heavens

113
00:11:38,679 --> 00:11:41,672
for your recovery during the Lantern Festival.

114
00:11:42,039 --> 00:11:44,993
That's how you're able to survive until now.

115
00:11:45,759 --> 00:11:47,713
Sister, you're right.

116
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:50,552
Lady Wu Zhen, what's your wish?

117
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:53,672
I wish for world peace.

118
00:11:55,879 --> 00:11:57,392
World peace?

119
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:00,912
I just hope that you can leave the world in peace.

120
00:12:17,446 --> 00:12:18,446
Your Majesty.

121
00:12:19,072 --> 00:12:20,156
Consort Mei.

122
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,640
Greetings, Your Majesty.

123
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,080
Greetings, Consort Mei, Your Highness.

124
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,953
I heard that you managed to crack two long-standing cases recently.

125
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:33,672
You've brought honor to the Mei family indeed.

126
00:12:34,159 --> 00:12:35,353
I was just fulfilling my duty.

127
00:12:36,080 --> 00:12:40,640
Commissioner Mei, do you know about the Lantern Festival?

128
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:43,833
It is an auspicious day when people make wishes and pray for blessings.

129
00:12:44,389 --> 00:12:47,428
Please don't worry. Little Fish and I did our research before coming.

130
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:51,712
So, Mei Yu, what wish do you have?

131
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,233
I hope for a prosperous state and world peace.

132
00:13:00,440 --> 00:13:02,032
- World peace?   - World peace?

133
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:05,985
Commissioner Mei, you're concerned about the world.

134
00:13:06,440 --> 00:13:08,593
You're indeed a true gentleman.

135
00:13:08,879 --> 00:13:09,914
Sister,

136
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,548
don't make your favoritism so obvious.

137
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:18,799
Even if you don’t worship the deities day to day,

138
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,512
you still ought to respect them when it matters.

139
00:13:21,679 --> 00:13:25,912
Especially at your age, when it's great to find a partner.

140
00:13:26,480 --> 00:13:28,272
You guys should pray to them sincerely.

141
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,233
Send your wishes to the sky with the sky lanterns.

142
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,632
If the heavens see them, they'll surely arrange

143
00:13:35,159 --> 00:13:38,392
a good partner for you two.

144
00:13:40,159 --> 00:13:42,272
Let's just hope that it'll work at the very last minute.

145
00:13:43,699 --> 00:13:44,756
This...

146
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:49,833
I mean, I'll pray to them sincerely.

147
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:06,713
That's huge.

148
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,073
This looks amazing too.

149
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:11,113
This is made from cloth while this is made from paper.

150
00:14:11,268 --> 00:14:12,820
It's just a lantern.

151
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,906
Aren't they devoting too much effort to it?

152
00:14:15,159 --> 00:14:16,833
They want to pick the best-looking lanterns,

153
00:14:17,559 --> 00:14:21,313
hoping that the heavens will notice them due to their appearance.

154
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:24,233
It's merely the playful nature of youngsters like them.

155
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:27,752
But Cat Lord, you're only in your twenties.

156
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,552
You should question yourself as to why you're not behaving like them.

157
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,713
Just like what you said, it's the playful nature of youngsters.

158
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:40,433
You're a snake demon who's over 100 years old. Stop butting in.

159
00:14:40,559 --> 00:14:42,073
Do you think I'm doing this of my own accord?

160
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:46,792
Now, I'm the daughter of a minister, you know?

161
00:14:47,679 --> 00:14:48,912
I have to play the part.

162
00:14:59,732 --> 00:15:00,776
Lady Hu Zhu?

163
00:15:00,879 --> 00:15:03,392
Master Shuang Jiang, aren't you celebrating the Lantern Festival?

164
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,357
I'm searching for demons.

165
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:17,353
Did you say that you were searching for demons?

166
00:15:19,480 --> 00:15:22,392
Fourth Master Mei said he saw the silhouettes of demons today.

167
00:15:23,080 --> 00:15:25,713
I'm making rounds just in case anything happens.

168
00:15:25,960 --> 00:15:29,152
But I didn't notice anything unusual during my rounds.

169
00:15:30,081 --> 00:15:32,160
- Did it prick your hand?   - Lady Hu Zhu, be careful! There's a demon!

170
00:15:38,980 --> 00:15:41,859
I'm sorry. Are you okay?

171
00:15:42,840 --> 00:15:43,894
I'm fine.

172
00:15:44,919 --> 00:15:47,953
I'll continue with my search, then.

173
00:15:49,399 --> 00:15:51,792
Master Shuang Jiang, this is a rare occasion.

174
00:15:52,080 --> 00:15:53,792
You should join us in making sky lanterns.

175
00:15:54,039 --> 00:15:55,760
Master Shuang Jiang, come and join us.

176
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,672
Yeah. We've made plenty of them.

177
00:15:57,856 --> 00:15:58,901
Let's go.

178
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:03,304
Come.

179
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:12,073
Commissioner Mei, may we speak in private?

180
00:16:21,519 --> 00:16:22,593
Lady Xie, do you need anything?

181
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:25,433
I've been hearing your name quite often lately.

182
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:28,872
People say that you're one of the outstanding young talents.

183
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,272
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau has returned to the right track,

184
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,953
and it's all thanks to you.

185
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,953
They flatter me.

186
00:16:35,240 --> 00:16:37,152
Commissioner Mei, you're upright and just.

187
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:39,912
I have something to tell you.

188
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:42,353
Do you have a case to report?

189
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:44,840
That's not it.

190
00:16:45,559 --> 00:16:48,640
After hearing so much about you,

191
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,672
it's only natural for me to admire you, Commissioner Mei.

192
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:55,193
You may not know, but Father was strict with me.

193
00:16:55,720 --> 00:16:59,912
It's difficult for me to encounter a stranger without any banquets.

194
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:04,713
Although he's your father, he shouldn't restrict your freedom.

195
00:17:05,519 --> 00:17:08,993
However, this case isn't under the jurisdiction of my bureau.

196
00:17:09,799 --> 00:17:10,922
That's not it.

197
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,433
Actually, Father is pretty nice.

198
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,633
He treats my family and younger members very well.

199
00:17:14,839 --> 00:17:17,193
Father serves in the Ministry of Personnel, and he has many students.

200
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:19,552
His position also benefits their careers tremendously.

201
00:17:20,519 --> 00:17:24,792
Commissioner Mei, are you willing to take Father as your mentor

202
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:27,352
and have a close relationship with him?

203
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:32,233
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau is independent of the Six Ministries.

204
00:17:32,599 --> 00:17:34,003
If I get myself involved with them,

205
00:17:34,084 --> 00:17:35,552
people will suspect me of forming a faction.

206
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:41,032
Moreover, the cases we take on are vastly different from what they handle.

207
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,552
Let's forget about the rest. What about me?

208
00:17:46,279 --> 00:17:47,713
What should I say about that?

209
00:17:48,559 --> 00:17:50,512
Commissioner Mei, you exude extraordinary elegance.

210
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:54,032
I took a liking to you since our first encounter.

211
00:17:54,440 --> 00:17:58,512
I want to know if you have any feelings for me.

212
00:18:05,640 --> 00:18:08,993
Thank you for the flattery. However, I have no such intentions.

213
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:11,752
Do you hate me?

214
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:13,953
Lady Liao, we only met a few times.

215
00:18:14,200 --> 00:18:15,312
Why would I hate you?

216
00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:20,633
My background is extraordinary. Why do you not intend to pursue me, then?

217
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,790
Sorry about this.

218
00:18:27,119 --> 00:18:28,913
Commissioner Mei, are you not willing to explain yourself?

219
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:31,099
In my opinion, there's no need for external reasons

220
00:18:31,179 --> 00:18:32,873
if one truly fancies another.

221
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,993
Lady Xie, I have no feelings for you.

222
00:18:36,319 --> 00:18:37,713
Commissioner Mei, don't misunderstand me.

223
00:18:37,993 --> 00:18:39,487
I grew up studying the rules of being a virtuous woman,

224
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:40,829
and my family was very strict.

225
00:18:40,910 --> 00:18:42,224
I won't pester you.

226
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,233
I'm not as rude and unreasonable as Princess Qing He.

227
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:49,193
Even if one doesn't obey the rules and is defiant,

228
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,953
everyone has their own way of living.

229
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:52,953
Lady Wu has her own merits as well.

230
00:18:53,960 --> 00:18:57,433
You have no feelings for me. Is it because you want to marry the princess?

231
00:19:00,319 --> 00:19:02,752
Lady Xie, I merely disagreed with what you said.

232
00:19:04,319 --> 00:19:05,953
Seems like the rumors were false.

233
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:08,873
You and Princess Qing He are close indeed.

234
00:19:09,680 --> 00:19:11,753
Are you being arrogant just because

235
00:19:11,833 --> 00:19:13,633
you got promoted to the rank of commissioner?

236
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:16,393
If I tell my father to criticize you, you'll...

237
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:25,393
Lady Xie, please mind your conduct.

238
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,433
Do not throw a tantrum here.

239
00:19:28,599 --> 00:19:29,752
What are you doing here?

240
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:34,279
Are you guys here to mock me together?

241
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,473
Lady Xie, what's wrong?

242
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,873
Xie is very timid.

243
00:19:38,039 --> 00:19:41,473
Your Highness, please spare her and stop scaring her.

244
00:19:41,799 --> 00:19:42,993
I didn't do so.

245
00:19:43,400 --> 00:19:44,552
She just...

246
00:19:49,279 --> 00:19:50,673
Relay my message to your father.

247
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:55,153
He praised Commissioner Mei for having a bright future ahead.

248
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,673
I can tell why he's the Minister of Personnel.

249
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,832
At least he's more discerning than those mediocre folks.

250
00:20:02,359 --> 00:20:05,792
Mr. Xie, care to join us for the Lantern Festival?

251
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,130
Sure.

252
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,953
Master Shuang Jiang, do you have a wish?

253
00:20:32,920 --> 00:20:34,312
To slay demons and purge evil!

254
00:20:38,519 --> 00:20:43,032
How do you write the character "slay?"

255
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:45,032
"Slay", as in to slay demons and purge evil.

256
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:46,907
Don't you know how to write it?

257
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,873
Don't you have any decent wishes?

258
00:20:51,759 --> 00:20:52,759
Decent wishes?

259
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:09,089
(To make a fortune)

260
00:21:18,359 --> 00:21:19,394
Coming.

261
00:21:20,948 --> 00:21:21,969
How is it?

262
00:21:22,119 --> 00:21:23,119
What did you wish for?

263
00:21:25,160 --> 00:21:28,112
Of course it's to become a couple with Lady Liu.

264
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,360
Mei Si, what's with all the sky lanterns?

265
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,193
The journey is long and arduous.

266
00:21:36,359 --> 00:21:38,233
I don't want any accidents to happen.

267
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,312
With all these sky lanterns, I'm sure the heavens will see them somehow.

268
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,713
I don't know if the heavens can see them or not.

269
00:21:46,319 --> 00:21:49,792
But I know Lady Liu can see them for sure.

270
00:21:57,519 --> 00:22:00,433
I wonder what wish Lady Liu has made.

271
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,519
- Si.   - Miss Zhen.

272
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:08,953
That's Lady Liu's sky lantern.

273
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,752
You'll get used to it eventually.

274
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:18,713
Miss Zhen, at least she's thinking of me when she releases them.

275
00:22:20,640 --> 00:22:21,713
Aren't you going to release one?

276
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:26,112
I'm not a kid. Why would I believe something like this?

277
00:22:26,440 --> 00:22:28,153
It's not like you'll die from this.

278
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,112
Even a blockhead like Huang Yi has released two of them, you know?

279
00:22:31,559 --> 00:22:33,193
He said he wanted to form a family.

280
00:22:34,079 --> 00:22:35,560
A true gentleman doesn't resort to violence.

281
00:22:37,519 --> 00:22:42,272
Huang, instead of making a wish to the heavens,

282
00:22:42,839 --> 00:22:44,633
I think finding a matchmaker will be more effective.

283
00:22:50,648 --> 00:22:52,016
The people of Chang'an said sky lanterns are most effective

284
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,711
when released on the Lantern Festival.

285
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:55,552
Lady Wu Zhen, do you want to make a wish?

286
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,414
Sure.

287
00:23:00,079 --> 00:23:03,153
Miss Zhen, you actually agreed to it upon hearing his proposal?

288
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:05,393
I tried to persuade you to do the same every year,

289
00:23:05,519 --> 00:23:06,792
yet you ignored me.

290
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:14,473
Hurry and make a wish.

291
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:18,752
Mr. Xie, since you brought the sky lantern here for me,

292
00:23:20,079 --> 00:23:22,233
I wish you longevity.

293
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:23,913
Lady Wu Zhen, I wish you health.

294
00:23:24,160 --> 00:23:25,352
May all your wishes come true.

295
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:26,713
May no disasters fall upon you.

296
00:23:27,000 --> 00:23:28,199
May you have a bright future ahead.

297
00:23:28,279 --> 00:23:29,552
May you go through an unobstructed journey.

298
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:30,960
- May...   - Wait a minute.

299
00:23:31,720 --> 00:23:32,936
Is this a poetry contest?

300
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:34,792
Can you guys make a decent wish for once?

301
00:23:41,240 --> 00:23:42,314
You'd better write it properly.

302
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:56,180
(The world)

303
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:01,537
(Safe)

304
00:24:04,736 --> 00:24:06,677
(Peaceful)

305
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:10,953
(May the Demon Market be safe and peaceful.)

306
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:13,953
(May the world be peaceful and prosperous.)

307
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:20,120
(Ruyi Pavilion)

308
00:26:15,951 --> 00:26:16,968
Look!

309
00:26:17,119 --> 00:26:18,153
Look! It's so high in the sky!

310
00:26:19,240 --> 00:26:20,240
It's gorgeous!

311
00:26:24,519 --> 00:26:26,673
- Look!   - (Something's off about the lantern.)

312
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:29,279
(Wait, this is...)

313
00:26:29,960 --> 00:26:31,052
(This must be sorcery.)

314
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,953
(A demon is controlling the lantern.)

315
00:26:36,319 --> 00:26:37,913
Something feels off.

316
00:26:40,519 --> 00:26:42,880
Lady Hu Zhu, what did you say?

317
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:44,393
I said, you were born to make sky lanterns.

318
00:26:46,359 --> 00:26:48,953
Of course. People call me a master, you know?

319
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,913
Make another one, then.

320
00:26:54,039 --> 00:26:55,050
Okay.

321
00:26:58,119 --> 00:27:01,393
I never expected anyone here to release such a grand sky lantern.

322
00:27:02,359 --> 00:27:03,680
Even I've never achieved such a feat.

323
00:27:04,119 --> 00:27:07,473
Yeah. I've never seen such a gigantic sky lantern before.

324
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:09,832
I wonder who released it.

325
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:18,290
What's going on?

326
00:27:19,240 --> 00:27:20,306
It's raining fire!

327
00:27:22,839 --> 00:27:23,941
Run!

328
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:28,466
Run!

329
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:37,713
Lady Liu...

330
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:51,473
(Is that actually Xuan Hui?)

331
00:27:52,759 --> 00:27:54,512
(How did he manage to escape from Demon Prison?)

332
00:28:01,400 --> 00:28:02,473
Is he targeting me?

333
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,993
Wait. It's crowded here.

334
00:28:09,119 --> 00:28:10,440
It'll be terrible if we hurt someone by accident.

335
00:28:10,527 --> 00:28:11,560
I'll deal with the lantern.

336
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:13,064
All right.

337
00:28:13,599 --> 00:28:15,032
The lantern is imbued with demonic power.

338
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,393
I assume Xuan Hui is nearby.

339
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:19,132
I'll look for him.

340
00:28:19,324 --> 00:28:20,401
Be careful.

341
00:28:20,655 --> 00:28:21,702
Okay.

342
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:26,753
- Huang Yi.   - Lady Wu Zhen.

343
00:28:26,834 --> 00:28:28,880
- Why are you...   - Tell the Jinwu Guards to evacuate the people.

344
00:28:29,084 --> 00:28:30,198
Tell them not to hide in the buildings.

345
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:32,959
Notify the Fire Supervision Bureau as well. Go now.

346
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:34,319
Yes, my lady. Let's go.

347
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:38,240
Do not panic. Head in that direction.

348
00:28:43,359 --> 00:28:44,512
Hurry, over here.

349
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:45,947
Get down from here.

350
00:28:46,328 --> 00:28:47,357
Hurry!

351
00:28:47,680 --> 00:28:48,873
Help!

352
00:29:40,599 --> 00:29:41,999
What's with the huge fire?

353
00:29:42,079 --> 00:29:44,112
Yeah. Did you see the giant lantern as well?

354
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,393
Who released it?

355
00:29:45,519 --> 00:29:47,433
It's too huge. It'll cause a fire easily.

356
00:29:47,519 --> 00:29:48,600
It's so dangerous.

357
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,072
It ruined the Lantern Festival for us.

358
00:29:56,380 --> 00:29:57,434
Your Majesty.

359
00:29:58,006 --> 00:30:00,086
We've notified the Fire Supervision Bureau. They'll arrive soon.

360
00:30:00,759 --> 00:30:02,112
There are many participants this year.

361
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,072
Relay my order. Have each family count their family members.

362
00:30:05,480 --> 00:30:07,112
Nothing else must go wrong.

363
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:09,792
Besides that, make an announcement.

364
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,768
To prevent another fire,

365
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:15,112
no one else is allowed to release a sky lantern.

366
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:16,871
Yes, Your Majesty.

367
00:30:33,319 --> 00:30:34,752
Over here!

368
00:30:35,440 --> 00:30:36,503
Lady Liu?

369
00:30:36,799 --> 00:30:37,828
Lady Liu!

370
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:42,913
Everyone, over here! Hurry!

371
00:30:49,349 --> 00:30:50,435
Excuse me.

372
00:30:50,516 --> 00:30:51,908
Have you seen Princess Qing He?

373
00:30:53,279 --> 00:30:54,560
Have you seen Princess Qing He?

374
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:55,999
Her Highness is strong and decisive.

375
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:57,359
- I think she left long ago.   - Let's hurry.

376
00:31:02,440 --> 00:31:05,233
Lady Xie, have you seen Princess Qing He?

377
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,535
I have.

378
00:31:06,680 --> 00:31:09,080
On the west side of the city gate tower. She pushed me down.

379
00:31:09,160 --> 00:31:10,673
Where did she go after that?

380
00:31:10,996 --> 00:31:12,041
I don't know.

381
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:14,233
The fire got worse when I turned around and looked.

382
00:31:17,160 --> 00:31:18,278
Commissioner Mei!

383
00:31:44,321 --> 00:31:45,364
Where are you going?

384
00:31:45,680 --> 00:31:46,919
Lady Wu Zhen might still be up there.

385
00:31:46,990 --> 00:31:48,223
I've known Lady Wu Zhen for many years.

386
00:31:48,304 --> 00:31:49,464
She's not an ordinary lady.

387
00:31:49,599 --> 00:31:51,800
With her skills, it's unlikely that she's trapped.

388
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:54,153
And, the firefighters will arrive soon. What's the use of heading up there?

389
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,873
Even so, I can't afford to let anything happen to her.

390
00:32:14,000 --> 00:32:15,064
Come back!

391
00:32:19,519 --> 00:32:21,752
Xuan Hui, where do you think you can escape to?

392
00:32:32,494 --> 00:32:33,848
It's been six years since we met.

393
00:32:34,079 --> 00:32:35,672
The Demon Prison is pitch black.

394
00:32:36,079 --> 00:32:37,832
I can't even remember how long I've been there.

395
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:42,552
How did you manage to escape?

396
00:32:43,680 --> 00:32:45,072
Why did you target Cat Lord?

397
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:47,800
You're pretty concerned about her, huh?

398
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:49,473
Stop beating around the bush.

399
00:32:50,095 --> 00:32:53,088
You're still the same even after all these years, huh?

400
00:32:53,559 --> 00:32:55,072
You didn't even bother to say hello.

401
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:57,153
Say hello, huh?

402
00:32:59,904 --> 00:33:00,948
I'll grant you your wish.

403
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,673
That's not what I meant!

404
00:33:10,359 --> 00:33:12,199
Listen! I'm more than a match for you!

405
00:33:12,279 --> 00:33:13,356
Don't force me to do this!

406
00:33:18,960 --> 00:33:20,873
You're the Serpent Lord! You can't torture me for no reason!

407
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,592
That's not it.

408
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:29,352
At most, I'm just lecturing my junior here.

409
00:33:29,440 --> 00:33:30,441
Nonsense!

410
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:33,800
Why would a senior lecture a junior by sending him to Demon Prison?

411
00:33:33,880 --> 00:33:35,873
That's already a light punishment for you.

412
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,552
You've harmed Cat Lord.

413
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,112
If you insist on resisting arrest, I may choose to end you here.

414
00:33:45,920 --> 00:33:47,393
Are you truly trying to kill me?

415
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:52,352
You're actually trying to kill me for an outsider's sake?

416
00:35:11,400 --> 00:35:13,152
Father!

417
00:35:13,440 --> 00:35:15,152
Sister!

418
00:35:16,719 --> 00:35:17,840
Sister!

419
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:20,793
Sister! Don't abandon me!

420
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:31,793
Wu Zhen!

421
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,152
Wu Zhen!

422
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:19,795
It's them!

423
00:36:20,055 --> 00:36:21,065
Wu Zhen!

424
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:35,592
I've already administered the medicine.

425
00:36:36,039 --> 00:36:38,032
It can soothe his nerves and relieve his pain temporarily.

426
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:41,320
However, he still needs to rest and recuperate for some time.

427
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,097
The city wall was already tall, and he jumped off the wall

428
00:36:43,177 --> 00:36:44,920
while carrying Your Highness.

429
00:36:45,000 --> 00:36:46,712
That's why his legs are seriously wounded.

430
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:49,313
It might cause a chronic problem later on.

431
00:36:49,592 --> 00:36:50,686
Ming Zhuang.

432
00:36:50,961 --> 00:36:53,434
I remember that Father has a collection of rare herbs.

433
00:36:54,079 --> 00:36:55,473
Take the imperial physician there.

434
00:36:55,679 --> 00:36:57,353
See if there's anything useful.

435
00:37:14,959 --> 00:37:16,512
Was the culprit Xuan Hui?

436
00:37:17,154 --> 00:37:19,983
It's him. He was supposed to be in Demon Prison.

437
00:37:20,135 --> 00:37:21,552
How did he manage to escape?

438
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,913
Serpent Lord is dealing with the case. We'll know when she captures him.

439
00:37:38,669 --> 00:37:40,505
Boss, you mustn't!
