(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,073 --> 00:01:34,040
(Episode 21)

3
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:41,320
(Ruyi Pavilion)

4
00:01:41,496 --> 00:01:44,279
I didn't expect spies to be planted in Ruyi Pavilion.

5
00:01:44,359 --> 00:01:45,359
Boss.

6
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:46,567
I was wrong. I won't do it again.

7
00:01:46,648 --> 00:01:47,814
I won't do it again.

8
00:01:48,255 --> 00:01:50,221
Mr. Pei left Chang'an.

9
00:01:50,519 --> 00:01:52,246
Since you have been found out,

10
00:01:52,559 --> 00:01:54,406
I don't think he will look for you again.

11
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:56,920
Ruyi Pavilion

12
00:01:57,263 --> 00:01:58,909
will not hire you anymore.

13
00:02:00,712 --> 00:02:02,352
Boss!

14
00:02:02,432 --> 00:02:04,237
Please give me another chance.

15
00:02:05,191 --> 00:02:07,072
You get paid to work here

16
00:02:07,152 --> 00:02:09,078
so you shouldn't have any ill intentions.

17
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:11,678
Those who try to please both sides

18
00:02:12,232 --> 00:02:13,678
will end up with nothing.

19
00:02:17,089 --> 00:02:18,883
Go and get your last salary from the accounts room.

20
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:37,080
(Arcane Appraisal Bureau)

21
00:02:54,671 --> 00:02:55,671
What do you think

22
00:02:55,792 --> 00:02:57,877
is going on with Commissioner Mei?

23
00:02:58,431 --> 00:02:59,838
Within half a day,

24
00:03:00,192 --> 00:03:01,877
he has spaced out a dozen times.

25
00:03:02,312 --> 00:03:04,157
He also looks happy.

26
00:03:04,632 --> 00:03:06,917
Is he getting another promotion?

27
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,838
You have been doing nothing the whole morning

28
00:03:11,111 --> 00:03:14,518
except counting how many times Commissioner Mei spaced out

29
00:03:15,072 --> 00:03:16,072
and smiled?

30
00:03:17,512 --> 00:03:19,477
This is rare.

31
00:03:19,792 --> 00:03:21,157
I've never seen him behave like this.

32
00:03:23,591 --> 00:03:25,637
It is rare indeed.

33
00:03:27,312 --> 00:03:30,037
However, it's not possible.

34
00:03:30,391 --> 00:03:32,197
Rumors have spread around Chang'an

35
00:03:32,352 --> 00:03:35,518
that Commissioner Mei and Mr. Pei

36
00:03:35,912 --> 00:03:38,317
are fighting each other out of jealousy at the Duke's Residence

37
00:03:38,512 --> 00:03:40,437
and made Princess Qinghe upset.

38
00:03:40,991 --> 00:03:43,317
She chased both of them out of her residence.

39
00:03:44,431 --> 00:03:46,877
I thought he would look sad

40
00:03:47,072 --> 00:03:49,118
when he came to work today.

41
00:03:49,991 --> 00:03:51,678
Who's looking sad?

42
00:03:52,192 --> 00:03:53,917
Of course, it's Commissioner...

43
00:03:55,232 --> 00:03:56,597
Commissioner.

44
00:03:57,032 --> 00:03:59,037
Commissioner Mei, we are not talking about you.

45
00:03:59,192 --> 00:04:00,245
Absolutely not.

46
00:04:01,072 --> 00:04:02,125
Who are you talking about then?

47
00:04:03,632 --> 00:04:04,838
We are talking about

48
00:04:05,032 --> 00:04:06,917
Deputy Commander Huang of the Jinwu Guards.

49
00:04:07,671 --> 00:04:09,118
Why would he be sad?

50
00:04:11,792 --> 00:04:13,432
The Jinwu Guards

51
00:04:13,512 --> 00:04:14,798
gave us another case

52
00:04:15,312 --> 00:04:18,992
because Deputy Commander Huang is busy introducing young men

53
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,478
to Princess Qinghe

54
00:04:20,791 --> 00:04:21,805
and has no time to handle it.

55
00:04:22,089 --> 00:04:24,775
So, the case has been given to us.

56
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:36,077
Did the empress summon you because of Pei Ji Ya's incident?

57
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:38,592
Ji Ya left suddenly.

58
00:04:38,672 --> 00:04:40,158
There has to be an explanation.

59
00:04:41,231 --> 00:04:42,877
Thankfully, you rejected many men before.

60
00:04:43,471 --> 00:04:45,837
It's normal for them to leave sadly.

61
00:04:46,552 --> 00:04:47,552
Lady Wu Zhen,

62
00:04:49,151 --> 00:04:50,998
which man did you reject again?

63
00:04:52,471 --> 00:04:53,718
Is it your day off today?

64
00:04:54,752 --> 00:04:55,752
I'm not busy today.

65
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:58,957
Look who I brought you.

66
00:04:59,752 --> 00:05:01,038
This is my buddy, Song Yao.

67
00:05:01,231 --> 00:05:02,672
He just returned from the Yizhou border.

68
00:05:02,752 --> 00:05:03,877
He is good at horseback archery

69
00:05:04,151 --> 00:05:05,517
so he won't lose to you.

70
00:05:05,632 --> 00:05:07,877
Greetings, Princess Qinghe. I am Song Yao.

71
00:05:11,271 --> 00:05:12,478
What's going on?

72
00:05:12,791 --> 00:05:14,877
Didn't you just chase two men out?

73
00:05:15,512 --> 00:05:18,197
Deputy Commander Huang wants to find new men for you.

74
00:05:18,752 --> 00:05:20,238
I figured you should probably meet him.

75
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:21,952
Besides,

76
00:05:22,831 --> 00:05:24,358
this young man is not bad.

77
00:05:24,911 --> 00:05:26,232
It might be a good relationship.

78
00:05:26,312 --> 00:05:27,437
Lady Wu Zhen, come.

79
00:05:28,151 --> 00:05:29,151
Sit down.

80
00:05:34,552 --> 00:05:36,558
In the past, I introduced you to eight men every year

81
00:05:36,831 --> 00:05:38,277
but none of them suited you.

82
00:05:38,431 --> 00:05:39,911
This time, I've finally found a man

83
00:05:39,992 --> 00:05:41,238
that matches you.

84
00:05:41,952 --> 00:05:43,277
I won't disappoint you.

85
00:05:48,231 --> 00:05:50,391
I know you like a man

86
00:05:50,471 --> 00:05:51,918
who is courageous and strong.

87
00:05:53,632 --> 00:05:56,637
I've observed him for a long time.

88
00:06:02,432 --> 00:06:03,558
That's too much praise, Huang.

89
00:06:03,831 --> 00:06:04,831
Actually,

90
00:06:05,952 --> 00:06:07,478
I've heard a lot about Her Highness

91
00:06:07,861 --> 00:06:09,113
and have admired you for a long time.

92
00:06:09,988 --> 00:06:11,282
What is it that you admire about me?

93
00:06:25,471 --> 00:06:26,558
Don't be nervous.

94
00:06:27,391 --> 00:06:28,391
I was just joking.

95
00:06:28,471 --> 00:06:29,485
No need to answer.

96
00:06:35,752 --> 00:06:37,637
Commissioner Mei, why are you here?

97
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:39,368
The Jinwu Guards

98
00:06:39,477 --> 00:06:41,396
transferred a case to the Arcane Appraisal Bureau today.

99
00:06:41,471 --> 00:06:42,718
I studied it

100
00:06:43,312 --> 00:06:44,397
and figured

101
00:06:44,791 --> 00:06:46,957
it belongs to the Jinwu Guards' jurisdiction.

102
00:06:48,632 --> 00:06:49,644
A friend of mine

103
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:50,992
came to visit today.

104
00:06:51,154 --> 00:06:52,990
So, I thought about asking the Arcane Appraisal Bureau

105
00:06:53,072 --> 00:06:56,038
and Commissioner Mei to help me with the documents.

106
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:59,038
I heard Deputy Commander Huang has a friend from Yizhou.

107
00:06:59,312 --> 00:07:01,678
I'm sure it's this young man.

108
00:07:04,552 --> 00:07:05,592
I am Song Yao.

109
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:07,197
Mei Zhu Yu from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

110
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:11,591
Commissioner Mei.

111
00:07:12,112 --> 00:07:14,472
Song might be in the Yizhou Army

112
00:07:14,552 --> 00:07:17,032
but he has been appreciated by the Yizhou governor over the years.

113
00:07:17,097 --> 00:07:18,323
He has a bright future ahead of him.

114
00:07:18,404 --> 00:07:21,358
I think he is a good match with Lady Wu Zhen.

115
00:07:24,512 --> 00:07:25,598
I see.

116
00:07:27,632 --> 00:07:28,718
A good match indeed.

117
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,118
Thank you, Commissioner Mei.

118
00:07:34,312 --> 00:07:36,437
Since Mr. Song has been in Yizhou for many years

119
00:07:36,752 --> 00:07:38,032
and is being appreciated,

120
00:07:38,112 --> 00:07:40,837
I'm sure you know a lot about Yizhou.

121
00:07:41,432 --> 00:07:42,432
Naturally.

122
00:07:42,711 --> 00:07:44,232
I know Yizhou like the back of my hand.

123
00:07:44,312 --> 00:07:46,592
Mr. Mei, if you want to take a trip to Yizhou,

124
00:07:46,672 --> 00:07:47,918
I'm happy to answer your questions.

125
00:07:48,029 --> 00:07:49,252
I don't want to go there on a trip

126
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:52,598
but I have something to ask you, Mr. Song.

127
00:07:53,676 --> 00:07:56,161
I heard the northern parts of Yizhou have suffered a drought for days.

128
00:07:56,432 --> 00:07:58,238
Has it been resolved now?

129
00:08:00,791 --> 00:08:02,038
I think

130
00:08:02,591 --> 00:08:03,591
it has.

131
00:08:05,192 --> 00:08:08,118
Yizhou's Ta Mountain has been plagued by bandits for years.

132
00:08:08,231 --> 00:08:10,358
I'm sure the problem has been rectified.

133
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:15,005
I think

134
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,998
it's almost rectified.

135
00:08:17,591 --> 00:08:19,798
Yizhou's Ke County has a plague outbreak.

136
00:08:20,271 --> 00:08:21,478
Have you found the source?

137
00:08:25,192 --> 00:08:26,192
I think it has been found.

138
00:08:28,112 --> 00:08:29,952
- Tuo River's flood...   - Actually...

139
00:08:31,391 --> 00:08:33,238
Actually, I'm not in charge of those

140
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,438
so I'm not clear about it.

141
00:08:38,432 --> 00:08:39,598
Excuse me for being abrupt.

142
00:08:57,032 --> 00:08:59,438
These are the cases the Jinwu Guards have transferred

143
00:08:59,552 --> 00:09:01,838
to the Arcane Appraisal Bureau since my appointment.

144
00:09:02,152 --> 00:09:03,478
I had a look at them again.

145
00:09:03,672 --> 00:09:05,277
These cases might be closed

146
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:08,238
but I still hope Deputy Commander Huang can check them again.

147
00:09:08,432 --> 00:09:10,277
Doing your duty in your position.

148
00:09:10,672 --> 00:09:12,797
I'm sure you won't refuse, Deputy Commander Huang.

149
00:09:14,032 --> 00:09:15,032
Of course.

150
00:09:15,591 --> 00:09:16,591
Of course.

151
00:09:18,449 --> 00:09:19,979
If you spent your effort in the wrong place,

152
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:21,889
it's as if you're shooting at the wrong target.

153
00:09:22,672 --> 00:09:26,078
I heard that you excel in horseback archery.

154
00:09:26,231 --> 00:09:27,231
I'm sure

155
00:09:27,912 --> 00:09:29,438
you won't make a mistake like this,

156
00:09:31,552 --> 00:09:32,552
right?

157
00:09:56,471 --> 00:09:57,718
You heard everything?

158
00:09:59,912 --> 00:10:00,912
I heard a little.

159
00:10:02,952 --> 00:10:04,078
Eight men in a year.

160
00:10:04,631 --> 00:10:05,684
Courageous and strong.

161
00:10:07,711 --> 00:10:09,511
Huang Yi did that. It was none of my business.

162
00:10:11,192 --> 00:10:12,192
I know.

163
00:10:12,631 --> 00:10:15,157
He won't introduce any man to you from now on.

164
00:10:16,792 --> 00:10:17,845
After tomorrow,

165
00:10:17,991 --> 00:10:18,991
the Jinwu Guards

166
00:10:19,871 --> 00:10:20,871
will be very busy.

167
00:10:29,912 --> 00:10:30,912
Didn't they say

168
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,358
both of them have parted ways?

169
00:10:34,871 --> 00:10:36,677
The rumors cannot be trusted.

170
00:10:37,912 --> 00:10:38,912
So,

171
00:10:39,383 --> 00:10:41,429
that Commissioner Mei is...

172
00:10:41,631 --> 00:10:43,557
You're asking about Commissioner Mei

173
00:10:43,637 --> 00:10:45,347
when you don't even know about the Tuo River flood?

174
00:10:55,272 --> 00:10:56,352
Mr. Mei

175
00:10:56,432 --> 00:10:59,358
was cold and had a sharp gaze.

176
00:10:59,751 --> 00:11:00,992
It was as sharp as a blade.

177
00:11:01,072 --> 00:11:02,637
I felt so uneasy.

178
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:06,637
Also, his glare was so fierce

179
00:11:07,792 --> 00:11:10,157
as if I stole his woman.

180
00:11:11,591 --> 00:11:13,952
Mr. Mei must be against me

181
00:11:14,032 --> 00:11:15,511
in the future.

182
00:11:15,591 --> 00:11:17,438
So, you must be careful in the future.

183
00:11:18,792 --> 00:11:20,877
If Mr. Mei hits you,

184
00:11:21,552 --> 00:11:23,677
I'm sure Lady Wu Zhen won't help you.

185
00:11:28,111 --> 00:11:30,998
They say buddies are more important

186
00:11:31,152 --> 00:11:32,478
than women.

187
00:11:33,591 --> 00:11:35,318
Is that how Lady Wu Zhen treats her buddy

188
00:11:36,231 --> 00:11:37,517
after she finds a man?

189
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,718
Let me give you some advice.

190
00:11:40,432 --> 00:11:42,877
When you claim to find a man for Lady Wu Zhen next time,

191
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:44,277
remember to see

192
00:11:44,511 --> 00:11:46,238
if the fierce Mr. Mei

193
00:11:46,392 --> 00:11:47,478
is around you.

194
00:12:09,392 --> 00:12:10,872
Are you sure they are together?

195
00:12:10,952 --> 00:12:12,397
You've been talking about it for so long.

196
00:12:12,952 --> 00:12:14,157
Can you be quiet for a while?

197
00:12:18,312 --> 00:12:19,598
But I can't

198
00:12:20,152 --> 00:12:21,598
accept it all of a sudden.

199
00:12:22,694 --> 00:12:24,488
If you can't accept it, just keep it to yourself.

200
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:27,312
They are here.

201
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:34,152
Brother-in-law.

202
00:12:35,751 --> 00:12:37,751
Fourth Brother, I remember

203
00:12:37,831 --> 00:12:39,118
I am your cousin.

204
00:12:39,751 --> 00:12:40,751
Yes.

205
00:12:41,192 --> 00:12:42,438
I remember that too.

206
00:12:45,312 --> 00:12:46,365
Come here, Little Fish.

207
00:12:51,511 --> 00:12:52,838
Mortals are so dull.

208
00:12:53,111 --> 00:12:54,797
It's just a night market

209
00:12:55,111 --> 00:12:56,838
that sells some trinkets

210
00:12:57,152 --> 00:13:00,358
and they call it a dating place for couples.

211
00:13:01,711 --> 00:13:04,631
When I heard you and Pei Ji Ya were chased out of the Duke's Residence,

212
00:13:04,711 --> 00:13:06,238
I wanted to comfort you.

213
00:13:06,591 --> 00:13:07,797
What a surprise,

214
00:13:08,111 --> 00:13:09,198
I was wrong.

215
00:13:09,312 --> 00:13:11,757
Little Fish, you are the pride of the Mei family.

216
00:13:11,912 --> 00:13:12,998
Stop teasing me, Fourth Brother.

217
00:13:13,192 --> 00:13:14,557
I really like her.

218
00:13:15,272 --> 00:13:16,272
I can see that.

219
00:13:17,871 --> 00:13:18,924
I thought

220
00:13:19,831 --> 00:13:20,958
you would be against this.

221
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:24,637
I experienced it before

222
00:13:25,312 --> 00:13:27,112
so I know how joyful it is

223
00:13:27,192 --> 00:13:28,718
to experience love.

224
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:30,958
However, I need to remind you

225
00:13:32,072 --> 00:13:34,557
that many people fall in love

226
00:13:35,272 --> 00:13:38,118
yet there are only a few who can be with each other forever.

227
00:13:39,552 --> 00:13:40,552
Kitty.

228
00:13:41,392 --> 00:13:43,078
I hope you don't share the same fate as me

229
00:13:43,831 --> 00:13:45,557
and end up feeling happy for nothing.

230
00:13:48,152 --> 00:13:50,198
I thought you were not a good match for Miss Zhen.

231
00:13:51,192 --> 00:13:54,118
Now, I hope both of you can be together.

232
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:56,231
Why?

233
00:13:56,591 --> 00:13:57,591
Because...

234
00:13:58,672 --> 00:14:01,718
Because we face the same situation.

235
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,598
Naturally, I know how to step into your shoes.

236
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:07,998
However, I am older than you after all.

237
00:14:09,192 --> 00:14:10,358
I've achieved more progress sooner

238
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:11,884
compared to you.

239
00:14:14,552 --> 00:14:16,037
I like him now

240
00:14:16,751 --> 00:14:19,637
so I won't worry about the future.

241
00:14:20,351 --> 00:14:23,598
Even if we end up hating each other one day,

242
00:14:23,792 --> 00:14:24,998
I can still accept it.

243
00:14:26,068 --> 00:14:27,481
There's still a long way to go in life.

244
00:14:28,351 --> 00:14:31,198
We don't live our lives for one man.

245
00:14:31,631 --> 00:14:33,438
Since you are clear about everything,

246
00:14:33,952 --> 00:14:35,438
there's no need for me to stop you anymore.

247
00:14:36,272 --> 00:14:37,637
As you say,

248
00:14:38,392 --> 00:14:40,078
a demon's life is long

249
00:14:40,792 --> 00:14:42,838
but you only live once as a mortal.

250
00:14:43,751 --> 00:14:45,757
Since you're in the mortal realm,

251
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:49,157
just do what you want.

252
00:14:55,471 --> 00:14:56,471
Thank you.

253
00:14:58,111 --> 00:15:01,517
However, if you get hurt in the future because of love,

254
00:15:01,871 --> 00:15:03,118
you should not come to me and cry.

255
00:15:05,111 --> 00:15:06,198
I know.

256
00:15:09,312 --> 00:15:14,037
Great!

257
00:15:14,272 --> 00:15:15,757
How much is this?

258
00:15:19,111 --> 00:15:20,111
Look.

259
00:15:22,792 --> 00:15:23,792
Amazing!

260
00:15:25,312 --> 00:15:26,917
He has rosin in his mouth.

261
00:15:27,152 --> 00:15:29,517
When he spits, the rosin in his mouth comes in contact with the torch

262
00:15:29,631 --> 00:15:30,992
and makes a huge flame.

263
00:15:31,072 --> 00:15:32,198
It's not a special skill.

264
00:15:33,672 --> 00:15:34,672
Mr. Mei,

265
00:15:35,111 --> 00:15:37,631
being serious and knowledgeable is good

266
00:15:37,711 --> 00:15:38,711
but there's no need

267
00:15:39,351 --> 00:15:40,718
to be too knowledgeable sometimes.

268
00:15:41,751 --> 00:15:42,751
I misspoke.

269
00:15:44,991 --> 00:15:46,711
- Wonderful!   - Again!

270
00:15:52,552 --> 00:15:53,564
It's snowing.

271
00:15:55,032 --> 00:15:56,718
Why is it snowing today?

272
00:16:06,392 --> 00:16:07,677
Don't you like snow?

273
00:16:09,272 --> 00:16:10,677
Quzhou never snows.

274
00:16:13,551 --> 00:16:14,923
There's an early winter cold this year

275
00:16:15,711 --> 00:16:17,118
so it snows early.

276
00:16:27,231 --> 00:16:28,231
What's wrong?

277
00:16:30,831 --> 00:16:32,037
When I was young,

278
00:16:33,672 --> 00:16:35,157
every time it snowed early,

279
00:16:36,432 --> 00:16:38,358
my mother would cook three eggs.

280
00:16:38,991 --> 00:16:40,044
One for each of us.

281
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:42,445
She said

282
00:16:43,111 --> 00:16:45,838
it will bring us fortune and peace.

283
00:16:47,952 --> 00:16:48,952
In the blink of an eye,

284
00:16:50,351 --> 00:16:51,598
so many years have passed.

285
00:16:53,432 --> 00:16:54,757
Check, please.

286
00:16:58,231 --> 00:16:59,231
Here you go.

287
00:16:59,392 --> 00:17:00,392
Let's go.

288
00:17:01,631 --> 00:17:02,631
Zhu Yu.

289
00:17:03,192 --> 00:17:05,597
Can you guess what's in my hand?

290
00:17:09,632 --> 00:17:10,632
Eggs.

291
00:17:11,832 --> 00:17:13,277
Why are you so smart?

292
00:17:13,471 --> 00:17:15,631
You said you'd make an egg for me

293
00:17:15,742 --> 00:17:17,440
when it snows for the first time every year.

294
00:17:17,711 --> 00:17:19,804
Which one do you want? Pick one.

295
00:17:26,112 --> 00:17:27,112
This.

296
00:17:28,872 --> 00:17:30,198
I'll save the big one for Father.

297
00:17:30,991 --> 00:17:32,791
Go on. You're such a good boy.

298
00:17:35,632 --> 00:17:36,632
Father.

299
00:17:36,991 --> 00:17:37,991
Egg.

300
00:18:23,511 --> 00:18:24,564
I'm going to buy something.

301
00:18:27,632 --> 00:18:29,672
- I'm going to look for Kitty.   - Sure.

302
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:33,597
I'm waiting for you, Lady Liu!

303
00:18:41,832 --> 00:18:42,832
Little Fish.

304
00:18:43,352 --> 00:18:45,438
Did Miss Zhen say when she will be back?

305
00:18:50,271 --> 00:18:51,324
Great!

306
00:19:10,031 --> 00:19:11,638
Shu, why are you here?

307
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:14,071
- Did something happen in Demon City?   - Yes.

308
00:19:49,991 --> 00:19:51,557
It's the demonic flame again.

309
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:20,392
You're awake?

310
00:20:25,352 --> 00:20:26,678
Is something wrong with you?

311
00:20:26,791 --> 00:20:28,117
Why did you kidnap me?

312
00:20:28,432 --> 00:20:30,198
You fell for Mei Zhu Yu.

313
00:20:30,711 --> 00:20:31,918
That's not true, right?

314
00:20:33,031 --> 00:20:34,044
It's true.

315
00:20:34,551 --> 00:20:35,638
I like him.

316
00:20:36,392 --> 00:20:37,757
Zhen, have you forgotten

317
00:20:38,952 --> 00:20:39,952
that you are a demon?

318
00:20:40,231 --> 00:20:41,317
So what?

319
00:20:42,271 --> 00:20:43,284
I am a demon

320
00:20:43,392 --> 00:20:44,718
but I am also human.

321
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:47,517
I have friends and a family.

322
00:20:47,953 --> 00:20:49,638
Naturally, I need to have a lover.

323
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:53,478
Do you need so many people?

324
00:20:53,791 --> 00:20:54,791
You have me.

325
00:20:55,031 --> 00:20:56,117
Aren't we enough?

326
00:20:56,551 --> 00:20:57,551
Shu,

327
00:20:58,551 --> 00:21:00,478
we will be together forever.

328
00:21:01,112 --> 00:21:02,352
However, my fate with them

329
00:21:02,432 --> 00:21:03,638
only lasts for a few decades.

330
00:21:04,031 --> 00:21:06,757
It's just for a moment.

331
00:21:07,392 --> 00:21:09,678
I also want to experience life as a mortal.

332
00:21:10,071 --> 00:21:11,557
You have changed.

333
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:14,718
No wonder one of the sect elders lost to you.

334
00:21:16,031 --> 00:21:17,357
You've become better

335
00:21:17,751 --> 00:21:18,998
and have your own ideas now.

336
00:21:19,311 --> 00:21:20,557
You are no longer

337
00:21:20,991 --> 00:21:24,638
the cautious Cat Lord.

338
00:21:25,791 --> 00:21:26,791
Yes.

339
00:21:26,912 --> 00:21:27,965
I've grown up.

340
00:21:28,311 --> 00:21:29,718
So, you don't have to worry.

341
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,878
When did you like him?

342
00:21:34,952 --> 00:21:36,357
Did you fall for him

343
00:21:36,832 --> 00:21:39,077
when he was willing to risk his life in the Double Rebirth Array?

344
00:21:40,352 --> 00:21:41,364
This is different.

345
00:21:43,952 --> 00:21:45,438
I probably started liking him

346
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:48,837
earlier than that.

347
00:21:49,912 --> 00:21:52,872
Perhaps it was when he said a woman's life

348
00:21:52,952 --> 00:21:54,357
should not be based on marriage.

349
00:21:56,192 --> 00:21:57,357
Perhaps,

350
00:21:59,112 --> 00:22:00,757
it was also when I was being mischievous

351
00:22:02,352 --> 00:22:04,832
yet he still understood, tolerated,

352
00:22:04,912 --> 00:22:06,277
and put up with me.

353
00:22:10,791 --> 00:22:11,791
But he

354
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:15,277
is just an ordinary mortal.

355
00:22:18,912 --> 00:22:19,912
Run!

356
00:22:20,231 --> 00:22:21,231
Run!

357
00:22:48,912 --> 00:22:49,912
It's fine now.

358
00:22:50,112 --> 00:22:52,238
It was such a huge fire. How was it put out?

359
00:22:52,952 --> 00:22:54,512
There was no one to put it out as well.

360
00:22:54,592 --> 00:22:56,478
Little Fish, what happened?

361
00:22:57,511 --> 00:22:58,511
Are you all right?

362
00:23:00,751 --> 00:23:02,037
Where are Miss Zhen and Lady Liu?

363
00:23:07,471 --> 00:23:08,471
Let's go.

364
00:23:10,632 --> 00:23:12,718
He is not just an ordinary mortal.

365
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,317
In my opinion,

366
00:23:14,791 --> 00:23:16,557
he is different from other people.

367
00:23:22,751 --> 00:23:23,751
He is very good.

368
00:23:25,392 --> 00:23:26,392
Good?

369
00:23:28,672 --> 00:23:29,672
Shu.

370
00:23:31,432 --> 00:23:32,597
In Demon City,

371
00:23:33,311 --> 00:23:35,077
I am a monster who's only half demon.

372
00:23:36,071 --> 00:23:37,124
In the mortal realm,

373
00:23:37,672 --> 00:23:39,718
I am a dandy that's unbefitting of a lady.

374
00:23:40,912 --> 00:23:42,238
In the last 18 years,

375
00:23:42,952 --> 00:23:44,718
I seem to be taking care of both realms

376
00:23:45,672 --> 00:23:47,718
but I'm subject to criticism on both sides.

377
00:23:49,632 --> 00:23:50,797
Only when I'm with him,

378
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:53,764
I can be Wu Zhen

379
00:23:55,192 --> 00:23:56,438
without needing to explain

380
00:23:57,271 --> 00:23:58,557
or change myself.

381
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:01,077
When I was with him,

382
00:24:01,872 --> 00:24:03,398
I feel calm.

383
00:24:05,832 --> 00:24:08,438
So, are you saying

384
00:24:09,672 --> 00:24:11,638
that I've never made you feel calm?

385
00:24:12,271 --> 00:24:13,878
We make sacrifices for each other

386
00:24:14,031 --> 00:24:16,037
because we are best friends and comrades.

387
00:24:17,751 --> 00:24:18,918
However, he is different.

388
00:24:19,872 --> 00:24:22,878
He acknowledges and likes me.

389
00:24:23,031 --> 00:24:24,398
I like you too.

390
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:27,878
What did you say?

391
00:24:27,991 --> 00:24:29,557
I said I like you more than he does.

392
00:24:29,952 --> 00:24:31,718
18 years ago, I lost my memory.

393
00:24:31,882 --> 00:24:33,842
I didn't know where I came from and I had nowhere to go.

394
00:24:33,952 --> 00:24:35,077
I've been living for your sake

395
00:24:35,271 --> 00:24:36,597
for 18 years.

396
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,632
Zhen.

397
00:24:39,231 --> 00:24:40,231
You said

398
00:24:40,511 --> 00:24:41,638
I belonged to you.

399
00:24:43,632 --> 00:24:44,685
Can you

400
00:24:46,192 --> 00:24:47,557
not have someone else too?

401
00:24:49,511 --> 00:24:53,117
I... I don't know.

402
00:24:55,031 --> 00:24:56,277
You know now.

403
00:24:56,487 --> 00:24:58,932
You know why I'm doing all I can to make you into a complete demon.

404
00:24:59,152 --> 00:25:01,117
You know why I'm risking everything for your own good.

405
00:25:01,311 --> 00:25:02,471
You know why you are the only one

406
00:25:02,551 --> 00:25:03,958
who can come here as you wish

407
00:25:04,231 --> 00:25:06,317
and why your wish is my belief.

408
00:25:07,672 --> 00:25:08,998
Now that you know everything,

409
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:11,438
are you still going to choose him?

410
00:25:16,991 --> 00:25:19,837
Zhen, we have been with each other for 18 years

411
00:25:20,231 --> 00:25:21,797
but you only spent a few months with him.

412
00:25:21,991 --> 00:25:23,357
Are you still going to choose him?

413
00:25:26,672 --> 00:25:28,837
I've always seen you as my best friend.

414
00:25:30,711 --> 00:25:31,764
Friend?

415
00:25:43,832 --> 00:25:44,832
You should go.

416
00:25:47,832 --> 00:25:48,832
Shu.

417
00:25:49,071 --> 00:25:50,071
Go!

418
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:35,471
Are you all right?

419
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:39,878
Gray Sect

420
00:26:41,511 --> 00:26:43,638
hasn't elected a new elder yet.

421
00:26:44,271 --> 00:26:46,198
The sect's matters are a mess.

422
00:26:48,511 --> 00:26:50,597
Appoint Wu Zi Shu as the interim elder

423
00:26:54,271 --> 00:26:55,718
and let him calm down.

424
00:26:57,791 --> 00:26:58,791
Yes.

425
00:27:09,231 --> 00:27:11,117
Little Fish, calm down.

426
00:27:11,667 --> 00:27:13,673
Miss Zhen will be fine.

427
00:27:13,791 --> 00:27:14,804
Nothing can happen to her.

428
00:27:15,751 --> 00:27:17,912
- Little Fish, you don't need to worry.   - Mei Zhu Yu.

429
00:27:19,231 --> 00:27:20,231
What are you looking for?

430
00:27:22,231 --> 00:27:24,198
Lady Liu, where did both of you go?

431
00:27:28,632 --> 00:27:29,632
Where did you go?

432
00:27:32,392 --> 00:27:33,392
What's wrong?

433
00:27:37,672 --> 00:27:39,077
18 years ago,

434
00:27:40,991 --> 00:27:42,117
it was also snowing that night.

435
00:27:46,471 --> 00:27:47,471
I thought...

436
00:27:51,672 --> 00:27:53,357
I thought you were gone as well.

437
00:27:55,352 --> 00:27:56,478
It's my fault.

438
00:27:57,872 --> 00:27:59,238
I shouldn't have left.

439
00:28:15,592 --> 00:28:16,718
Nothing is wrong with you.

440
00:28:18,271 --> 00:28:19,271
You are very good.

441
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,517
For fortune

442
00:28:36,031 --> 00:28:37,084
and peace.

443
00:29:23,471 --> 00:29:24,471
Have you heard?

444
00:29:24,592 --> 00:29:26,792
Brother Mei has reconciled with Princess Qinghe.

445
00:29:26,872 --> 00:29:28,711
Two days ago, I heard they argued.

446
00:29:28,791 --> 00:29:30,014
The situation changed so quickly.

447
00:29:30,095 --> 00:29:32,850
- Right.   - Things change so quickly.

448
00:29:32,912 --> 00:29:34,198
It's really strange.

449
00:29:34,432 --> 00:29:37,072
In my opinion, rumors cannot be trusted.

450
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,878
It makes people anxious.

451
00:29:42,912 --> 00:29:44,597
Are both of you all right?

452
00:29:55,751 --> 00:29:57,711
Both of you are really careless.

453
00:29:57,791 --> 00:29:59,557
Are you here to investigate a case?

454
00:30:00,071 --> 00:30:01,998
No. I'm looking for someone.

455
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:03,592
- Me?   - Me?

456
00:30:05,152 --> 00:30:06,471
I'm looking for Commissioner Mei.

457
00:30:06,551 --> 00:30:07,757
He has been summoned to the palace.

458
00:30:22,912 --> 00:30:25,238
Greetings, Your Majesty. Empress.

459
00:30:27,031 --> 00:30:29,597
Mr. Mei, you don't need to kneel.

460
00:30:30,192 --> 00:30:31,192
Sister, you...

461
00:30:34,872 --> 00:30:36,317
You are being biased.

462
00:30:42,392 --> 00:30:44,517
Enough. Stand up.

463
00:30:45,031 --> 00:30:46,031
Stand up quickly.

464
00:30:46,991 --> 00:30:49,231
You shouldn't blame your sister.

465
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:51,398
I'm sure she feels happy for you.

466
00:30:52,152 --> 00:30:54,797
I heard both of you will get married soon.

467
00:30:57,392 --> 00:31:00,037
I heard both of you get along well with each other.

468
00:31:00,751 --> 00:31:01,918
Is that true?

469
00:31:03,372 --> 00:31:05,117
Did Ming Zhuang inform you again?

470
00:31:07,063 --> 00:31:09,104
Rumors have spread all over the city.

471
00:31:09,192 --> 00:31:11,512
Do you think I still need

472
00:31:11,592 --> 00:31:13,077
Ming Zhuang to tell me about it?

473
00:31:15,954 --> 00:31:17,120
Your Majesty,

474
00:31:17,352 --> 00:31:18,720
This is not a rumor.

475
00:31:20,471 --> 00:31:23,718
Mr. Mei, you seem different.

476
00:31:24,426 --> 00:31:25,551
It's probably

477
00:31:25,632 --> 00:31:27,117
because I understood something

478
00:31:27,791 --> 00:31:28,958
after meeting Lady Wu Zhen.

479
00:31:32,711 --> 00:31:33,711
Look.

480
00:31:34,152 --> 00:31:36,398
They are inseparable now.

481
00:31:37,271 --> 00:31:38,284
Why don't

482
00:31:38,751 --> 00:31:39,958
I and the empress

483
00:31:40,071 --> 00:31:42,671
grant a marriage between you two immediately?

484
00:31:42,751 --> 00:31:43,751
What do you think?

485
00:31:43,991 --> 00:31:44,991
Grant a marriage?

486
00:31:46,872 --> 00:31:49,077
Mr. Mei told his father

487
00:31:49,311 --> 00:31:50,958
that he didn't want to get married previously.

488
00:31:51,471 --> 00:31:52,471
Is that

489
00:31:52,664 --> 00:31:54,344
what you still think right now?

490
00:31:54,432 --> 00:31:56,037
Marriage is not something

491
00:31:56,231 --> 00:31:58,191
that can be forced.

492
00:31:58,271 --> 00:31:59,998
Your Majesty. Empress.

493
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:02,872
Right now,

494
00:32:03,471 --> 00:32:04,524
I want to marry her.

495
00:32:08,071 --> 00:32:10,438
Whenever Lady Wu Zhen is willing to marry me,

496
00:32:12,071 --> 00:32:13,597
I will marry her.

497
00:32:17,432 --> 00:32:18,837
Have you thought about it thoroughly?

498
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:21,037
I have.

499
00:32:39,392 --> 00:32:40,557
That's wonderful.

500
00:32:45,991 --> 00:32:47,357
Wonderful.

501
00:32:57,991 --> 00:32:58,991
Lady Wu Zhen.

502
00:33:00,551 --> 00:33:01,551
What is it?

503
00:33:02,952 --> 00:33:04,678
I grew up in Quzhou

504
00:33:04,912 --> 00:33:06,438
and was raised by my master.

505
00:33:07,192 --> 00:33:08,918
Now that he has passed away,

506
00:33:09,471 --> 00:33:12,317
I still wish to return to inform him.

507
00:33:12,751 --> 00:33:13,958
You want to return to Quzhou?

508
00:33:15,031 --> 00:33:16,044
Quzhou is far.

509
00:33:16,152 --> 00:33:17,678
I want to depart today.

510
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:18,952
Today?

511
00:33:19,231 --> 00:33:20,284
Are you in a rush?

512
00:33:20,551 --> 00:33:22,678
If I leave soon, I can return early.

513
00:33:23,352 --> 00:33:24,364
Give me ten days.

514
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:26,597
I will return after ten days.

515
00:33:31,271 --> 00:33:32,271
Lady Wu Zhen.

516
00:33:32,952 --> 00:33:35,398
I will surely keep my promise.

517
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:37,245
- I...   - I understand.

518
00:33:54,071 --> 00:33:55,071
Ten days.

519
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,564
Ten days.

520
00:34:14,991 --> 00:34:16,117
I will surely return.

521
00:34:16,217 --> 00:34:17,866
(Chang'an)

522
00:36:55,151 --> 00:36:56,151
Brother Lu Yang.

523
00:36:58,832 --> 00:37:02,318
Brother Zhu Yu, I thought

524
00:37:02,591 --> 00:37:06,278
you wouldn't return

525
00:37:07,352 --> 00:37:10,717
because of your lavish life in Chang'an.

526
00:37:12,232 --> 00:37:13,232
Brother Lu Yang,

527
00:37:14,591 --> 00:37:15,591
you must be joking.

528
00:37:16,591 --> 00:37:17,717
Brother Lu Yang,

529
00:37:18,392 --> 00:37:19,878
are you

530
00:37:20,471 --> 00:37:21,672
waiting for me here?

531
00:37:21,752 --> 00:37:22,918
No.

532
00:37:23,952 --> 00:37:25,398
The fish

533
00:37:25,991 --> 00:37:27,637
has grown.

534
00:38:10,551 --> 00:38:11,958
I just completed the Pool Array.

535
00:38:16,631 --> 00:38:17,631
Brother Lu Yang!

536
00:38:17,752 --> 00:38:18,998
Why didn't you stop him?

537
00:38:19,511 --> 00:38:21,918
I couldn't stop him in time.

538
00:38:22,272 --> 00:38:23,918
Sorry, Brother Chi Hua.

539
00:38:24,591 --> 00:38:25,591
I thought

540
00:38:25,832 --> 00:38:27,551
the peach and bamboo forests

541
00:38:27,631 --> 00:38:29,028
had been switched to various pools.

542
00:38:29,092 --> 00:38:30,751
I didn't expect the core of the array to be here.

543
00:38:30,832 --> 00:38:32,551
It's all because Shuang Jiang

544
00:38:32,631 --> 00:38:33,991
was always stealing the fruits

545
00:38:34,071 --> 00:38:35,557
be it pears or peaches.

546
00:38:36,352 --> 00:38:38,312
Those fruits were all weapons

547
00:38:38,392 --> 00:38:39,798
yet he ate them all.

548
00:38:40,031 --> 00:38:41,316
It was a powerful array

549
00:38:41,752 --> 00:38:43,278
but he ate most of the formation.

550
00:38:44,392 --> 00:38:45,637
So, I figured

551
00:38:46,872 --> 00:38:48,557
I should dig a pool instead.

552
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:49,911
But once he came back,

553
00:38:49,991 --> 00:38:51,511
he came to catch fish in my pool.

554
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:53,398
He even grilled the fish before me.

555
00:38:55,031 --> 00:38:56,832
My arrays aren't used to defend against outsiders.

556
00:38:56,912 --> 00:38:58,278
It's all used to defend against him.

557
00:39:00,071 --> 00:39:01,071
Chi Hua!

558
00:39:05,151 --> 00:39:06,480
Enough talk.

559
00:39:06,671 --> 00:39:07,758
You should go inside.

560
00:39:10,685 --> 00:39:11,685
Brother Xiao Mu.

561
00:39:17,218 --> 00:39:20,280
(Changxi Palace)

562
00:40:30,952 --> 00:40:32,117
Greetings, Martial Brothers.
