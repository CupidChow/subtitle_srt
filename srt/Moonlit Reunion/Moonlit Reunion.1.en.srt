1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:04,480
Chang'an

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,680
<i> Rumor has it</i>

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,320
<i>that there's a hidden place in Chang'an.</i>

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:10,760
<i>It's called Demon Underworld,</i>

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,320
<i>ruled by Cat Lord and Snake Lord.</i>

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:17,440
<i>Their whereabouts are mysterious.</i>

7
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,360
<i>Apart from the two lords</i>
<i>and their four assistants,</i>

8
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:23,280
<i>other demons aren't allowed</i>
<i>to wreak havoc in the Mortal Realm.</i>

9
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:25,480
<i>It's also a way</i>
<i>to avoid their sworn enemies.</i>

10
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:27,720
<i>That's right.</i>

11
00:00:28,040 --> 00:00:31,000
<i>Their sworn enemies</i>
<i>are the Changxi Palace Celestial Masters.</i>

12
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:34,800
<i>They helped the court in establishing</i>
<i>Bureau of Mystic Investigations</i>

13
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,440
<i>to investigate strange cases</i>

14
00:00:36,520 --> 00:00:38,760
<i>in the hope of eradicating</i>
<i>all evil spirits.</i>

15
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,040
<i>The two sides fought openly</i>
<i>and schemed in secret.</i>

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,160
<i>In the end, Changxi Palace</i>
<i>fell into decline and chose seclusion.</i>

17
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:46,600
<i>Since then, Demon Underworld</i>
<i>held sway over both realms</i>

18
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,000
<i>and maintained peace</i>
<i>between humans and demons.</i>

19
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,000
<i>Bureau of Mystic Investigations</i>
<i>has become nothing but an empty title,</i>

20
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:53,440
<i>despised by all.</i>

21
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,360
<i>Wandering spirits</i>
<i>cast eerie shadows as they pass.</i>

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,120
<i>Trouble is bound to return.</i>
<i>Take my advice.</i>

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,680
<i>Here in Chang'an,</i>

24
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:05,960
<i>it's safest to step out after dawn</i>

25
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,120
<i>and return home before midnight.</i>

26
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:17,360
Episode 1

27
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,840
There's a demon.

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,760
Where do you think you're going?

29
00:02:52,040 --> 00:02:53,280
Who's there?

30
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
- Let's split up.
- Yes!

31
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,760
Stop!

32
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,520
Get him!

33
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:21,440
- Hyah!
- Hyah!

34
00:03:33,520 --> 00:03:35,600
Ruyi Pavilion

35
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:46,480
Waiter.

36
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:50,360
Bring two more plates of beef.

37
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,560
All right.

38
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:53,360
What?

39
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,280
Where did the cat come from?

40
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:37,680
Wu Zhen, County Princess Qinghe
Cat Lord of Demon Underworld

41
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,480
- Your Highness.
- Your Highness.

42
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Search the place.

43
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:23,400
Huang Yi, Chief of Imperial Patrol Guards

44
00:05:28,360 --> 00:05:29,440
Chief Huang.

45
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:30,720
Lady Hu Zhu.

46
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,520
Hu Zhu, Ruyi Pavilion's Shopkeeper,
Cat Lord's Assistant

47
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:35,760
Chief Huang, are you here to drink again?

48
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,000
I'm here on business.

49
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:39,400
I'm afraid some villains
have broken into your place.

50
00:05:39,480 --> 00:05:40,600
Villains?

51
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:42,640
I only have beauties here.

52
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:43,840
Where are the villains?

53
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,480
I clearly saw someone just now.

54
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,640
I won't fuss over your bar tabs.

55
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,680
Today, I have an important guest.

56
00:05:50,760 --> 00:05:52,520
Don't you dare ruin my business.

57
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:54,360
More important than me?

58
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,200
The young marquis of Yu'an Residence

59
00:05:57,280 --> 00:05:59,360
has splurged to book out the place today.

60
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,480
He wants to propose
to Lady Wu on her birthday.

61
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,520
- I managed to avoid him.
- Avoid who?

62
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,440
Gu Changhuai,
Yu'an Residence's Young Marquis

63
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:15,400
Young Marquis?

64
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:28,120
You can avoid anyone, but not me.

65
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:31,960
I've been waiting for you here
for a long time.

66
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,720
Why are you looking for me?

67
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:41,120
I heard that tomorrow is your birthday,
so I've prepared a gift for you.

68
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,240
Where's the gift?

69
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,040
Here.

70
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:48,040
- What is this?
- The marriage proposal.

71
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:55,840
What kind of gift is this?

72
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:58,880
I'm offering myself
as a birthday gift to you.

73
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,160
Ah…

74
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:04,200
How many caravans of jewelry is this?

75
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,240
This fine horse belongs
to the young marquis of Yu'an Residence.

76
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:10,600
Who is this betrothal gift for?

77
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:16,080
Zhuyu, we're already off duty.

78
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:17,360
Stop working the case.

79
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:18,480
Look.

80
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,840
We're just in time
for Lady Wu's betrothal festivities.

81
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,680
Ruyi Pavilion

82
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:27,600
Waiter, how much is it?

83
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,600
Three coins.

84
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:34,840
Thank you, sir.

85
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:36,880
Sir, aren't you going
to watch the fun?

86
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:38,880
What's there to watch?

87
00:07:39,480 --> 00:07:42,000
- Is this your first time here?
- I've been here for over a month.

88
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:43,400
You've been here for a month,

89
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:46,480
yet you still haven't heard
of this celebrated figure?

90
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:48,600
Lady Wu's name is Wu Zhen,
the daughter of the Duke

91
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,080
and the sister of the Empress.

92
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:52,040
The Emperor himself appointed her
County Princess Qinghe.

93
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:54,480
She's also infamous
for her rakish ways.

94
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,800
I'm long past the prime age for marriage

95
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,520
and my reputation is in tatters.

96
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,160
We've only known each other for a month.

97
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:07,160
Now you're here to propose marriage?

98
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,960
My ancestors must truly
be smiling down on us.

99
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:13,120
You sure like to joke around.

100
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:15,880
In the end, all a woman truly seeks

101
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:18,880
is to be a wife and a mother.

102
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:21,320
From now on,

103
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:24,280
you won't be an outcast
who can't get married in Chang'an.

104
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:27,960
This is my real birthday gift to you.

105
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:31,280
Wouldn't it be improper
if you gave me nothing in return?

106
00:08:33,280 --> 00:08:34,720
I don't think that's appropriate.

107
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:39,000
Everyone knows we're both wild at heart

108
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:40,920
and not bound by rules.

109
00:08:41,280 --> 00:08:45,360
On this joyous day of our betrothal,
passion may overtake us.

110
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:48,640
One night of giving in to passion

111
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:50,400
isn't really such a big deal.

112
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:54,760
You have a point.

113
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:02,360
Young Marquis.

114
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:04,320
Come here.

115
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:20,360
Ruyi Pavilion

116
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:23,960
You…

117
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:51,280
Ruyi Pavilion

118
00:10:05,840 --> 00:10:08,240
Here, have a peach
to replenish your strength.

119
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:13,680
You're unbelievable.
How could you kick him down the building?

120
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:15,600
You struck without any sense of restraint.

121
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:16,920
You broke my window.

122
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:19,240
You greedy and petty fox.

123
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,960
How much did I help you earn
from the young marquis?

124
00:10:22,360 --> 00:10:25,200
You can never have
too much money.

125
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:30,000
Huang Yi and those guards
didn't get suspicious, did they?

126
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:33,120
They can't do anything without any clues.

127
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:35,880
I've arranged for them to have a drink.

128
00:10:43,240 --> 00:10:46,800
The smell of blood.
You fought with the demon just now.

129
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:50,760
It's the demon that keeps harming people.

130
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:51,920
Where's the demon?

131
00:10:53,080 --> 00:10:54,560
It ran away.

132
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,000
But after fighting with it,

133
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:57,920
I've found some clues.

134
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:01,360
<i>That demon might be just like you.</i>

135
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,280
It's driven by greed.

136
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:04,800
What do you mean?

137
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,920
Do you still remember
the last few assault cases?

138
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:13,080
The first victim was Madam Cui,
Official Ding's wife.

139
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:15,120
She went home
to visit her family that day.

140
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:17,400
She dressed up nicely and wore jewelry.

141
00:11:17,960 --> 00:11:20,720
The second victim was Miss Tian,
Official Tian's daughter.

142
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,360
She's a regular customer
at the jewelry shop in the city.

143
00:11:23,440 --> 00:11:24,920
She likes to dress up.

144
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,040
The third was a Hu merchant
from the western market.

145
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:31,520
That Hu merchant is from a gold-rich land
in the Western Regions,

146
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,400
flashing gold all over himself.

147
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:37,200
And this latest female victim
was wearing a pair of gold earrings.

148
00:11:37,280 --> 00:11:41,120
It seems like
we need to set up a trap to lure it out.

149
00:11:41,800 --> 00:11:43,280
Lady Wu Zhen.

150
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,240
Mingzhuang, Servant of the Wu Manor

151
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,400
It's you, Mingzhuang.

152
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:51,320
It's Lady Wu Zhen's birthday tomorrow.

153
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:53,560
Her Majesty asked me to bring you a gift.

154
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:56,160
It turns out
that my gift has arrived early.

155
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:57,360
That's right.

156
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,400
Her Majesty also said
that in previous years,

157
00:11:59,480 --> 00:12:03,160
she had carefully selected name cards
of 20 eligible young gentlemen in Chang'an

158
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,200
but could never find one to your liking.

159
00:12:05,280 --> 00:12:07,640
This year,
she has spared herself the trouble.

160
00:12:07,720 --> 00:12:09,280
She ordered all the noble families

161
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:12,320
to submit the birth details
of every suitable man they've got.

162
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:14,960
She's certain you'll land yourself
a great husband.

163
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,480
My sister is doing it all for my own good.
I'll meet them right away.

164
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:24,520
Mingzhuang, pass it on.

165
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,920
I, Lady Wu,

166
00:12:27,000 --> 00:12:29,240
will hold a birthday banquet
at Ruyi Pavilion tomorrow.

167
00:12:29,320 --> 00:12:31,680
All distinguished ladies
and talented gentlemen are invited.

168
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:32,760
Yes.

169
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:36,680
Are you really going to meet them?

170
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:41,000
Tell them I won't accept
any birthday gifts tomorrow.

171
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,120
However, the attendees must dress up

172
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,360
and wear gold.

173
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,920
Zhuyu, please help me.

174
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,120
Every time I see Commander Xu,
he scolds me.

175
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:00,560
I'm a coroner,
but I'm sent to transcribe case files.

176
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:04,840
At this rate,
I'll be sent to clean toilets.

177
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,280
I'm so pitiful.

178
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,720
I don't know much about your affair.

179
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,920
I'm afraid I can't be of much help.

180
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:12,200
Of course you can.

181
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:13,680
I've heard about it.

182
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:16,160
You're quite talented.

183
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:19,960
If you hadn't missed those three questions
and ended up ranked seventh,

184
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:23,080
you wouldn't have had the bad luck
to be assigned to our bureau.

185
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,880
I can't bend the rules to help you.

186
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:28,920
But it's really different today.

187
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,760
I heard Commander Xu
went to a banquet yesterday

188
00:13:33,840 --> 00:13:36,600
and got teased about us being freeloaders.

189
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:38,040
If I go to him now,

190
00:13:38,200 --> 00:13:40,960
he might just send me
straight to the Record Library.

191
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:45,640
What?

192
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:47,760
Record Library?

193
00:13:47,840 --> 00:13:48,960
Yes.

194
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:52,600
That place is so creepy.

195
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:55,120
All the old clerks
who used to run the Record Library

196
00:13:55,320 --> 00:13:58,520
suddenly quit for no good reason
and went home.

197
00:13:58,600 --> 00:14:00,120
Commander Xu is worried
about being short-staffed.

198
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:03,920
Are you sure that

199
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:06,880
angering him will get you sent
to the Record Library?

200
00:14:06,960 --> 00:14:07,960
Yes.

201
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,320
Since we're colleagues,
I'll help you this time.

202
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,200
Let's go.

203
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:25,800
Xu Luan, Commander
of Bureau of Mystic Investigations

204
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:29,240
Those nerds at the magistrate's office

205
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,000
all think the case is weird and ominous.

206
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,080
They're avoiding it.

207
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:35,760
Imperial Patrol Guards
have searched the whole city for days

208
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,400
but didn't find anything.

209
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:40,520
When the city is in turmoil,
they pass the case to us.

210
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:43,040
What's the use of having you?

211
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:44,440
Commander Xu.

212
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:46,440
You, come here.

213
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,920
You seem quite talented.

214
00:14:55,640 --> 00:14:58,000
Speak boldly and bravely.

215
00:14:58,080 --> 00:14:59,360
What do you think?

216
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,760
You're dedicated to serving
the people with integrity.

217
00:15:01,840 --> 00:15:04,440
Now that thefts and strange cases
plague Chang'an,

218
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:07,600
you surely won't just stand by
and do nothing.

219
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:11,120
Tackling what ordinary folks can't
and cracking cases others can't.

220
00:15:11,480 --> 00:15:14,640
That's what you strive for
and what the bureau demands.

221
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,600
Well said.

222
00:15:17,160 --> 00:15:18,280
I think

223
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:22,320
we can't rely solely on questioning
and recording statements to file away.

224
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,360
We must truly seek out the thieves.

225
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:26,280
I'm sure you'll lead by example

226
00:15:26,360 --> 00:15:28,080
and personally visit the scenes.

227
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,160
When that time comes,
neither cunning criminals nor demons

228
00:15:31,240 --> 00:15:32,880
will escape your grasp.

229
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:34,240
- You--
- This way,

230
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:37,680
you won't have to be labeled a freeloader
every time you step outside,

231
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,160
forced to stew in silence
all alone at home.

232
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:41,800
You…

233
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:47,800
You…

234
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:51,400
scram to Record Library!

235
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:55,120
Will do, Commander Xu.

236
00:15:57,280 --> 00:15:58,280
I'll go too.

237
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,840
Huh?

238
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:03,280
- We'll go too.
- We'll go too.

239
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:05,600
Record Library

240
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:07,800
You're from the Mei family after all.

241
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:09,840
How can you settle
for such a minor post here?

242
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,760
So what if I'm from the Mei family?

243
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:14,800
Everyone has their own path
and their own fate to face.

244
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:20,640
How interesting.

245
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,960
As soon as I came in,

246
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,480
I heard such a statement.

247
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,760
It's so righteous and admirable.

248
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:28,840
Mei Si.

249
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,600
Mei Si, The Mei Family's Fourth Son

250
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:32,800
I suppose your duties
are nearly done by now.

251
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
What brings you here?

252
00:16:34,440 --> 00:16:36,120
Here's the thing, Little Zhuyu.

253
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:37,800
Accompany me to a banquet.

254
00:16:37,880 --> 00:16:38,960
Hmm?

255
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,720
I'm not interested.

256
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:42,960
Little Zhuyu.

257
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,800
Please help me.

258
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:47,040
Otherwise, Father will break my legs.

259
00:16:47,520 --> 00:16:48,600
I don't mind helping you.

260
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,280
But tell me first.

261
00:16:50,560 --> 00:16:52,120
What's going on?

262
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:55,200
Have you ever seen
County Princess Qinghe of the Wu family,

263
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:57,120
Wu Zhen?

264
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:03,040
I've heard of her.

265
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,960
The Empress ordered all families
to submit names of unmarried eligible men

266
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,360
for Lady Wu to check out.

267
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,160
You know how much
the Empress dotes on her sister.

268
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:11,480
- Two years ago--
- Cut to the chase.

269
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:12,600
Oh.

270
00:17:12,680 --> 00:17:15,040
All families had to submit
their name cards, right?

271
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:16,400
That arrogant Xie family

272
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,680
submitted as many as 19 bachelors.

273
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:20,760
We certainly weren't going to back down.

274
00:17:20,840 --> 00:17:24,000
So I kept searching

275
00:17:24,080 --> 00:17:25,440
back and forth

276
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,080
- until I--
- Please, get to the point.

277
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,960
Including you, I've gathered 20 people.

278
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:32,560
Little Zhuyu.

279
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,720
So you're just there to fill the seats

280
00:17:35,800 --> 00:17:36,800
and pig out.

281
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,200
Wu Zhen would never lower herself to you.

282
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:41,440
Uh… She'd never set her sights on you.

283
00:17:43,720 --> 00:17:46,600
I swear this is definitely

284
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,240
a spotless,

285
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,680
respectable feast.

286
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:07,480
Ruyi Pavilion

287
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:13,240
By the way, Little Zhuyu,
Wu Zhen is having a bad year.

288
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:14,600
Her Five Elements lack metal.

289
00:18:14,680 --> 00:18:17,560
Those who attend the banquet
should wear more gold accessories.

290
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,000
Here.

291
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:21,120
Wear this.

292
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:23,080
Wear it.

293
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:39,080
Come on. Let's drink.

294
00:18:39,640 --> 00:18:41,600
- It's so lively today.
- Yes.

295
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:43,480
Come on.

296
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:48,200
Duke Wu's family really knows
how to show off their wealth.

297
00:18:48,920 --> 00:18:52,440
Lady Wu has always been someone
who enjoys life to the fullest.

298
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:57,160
Those from Xiangsi House dance quite well.

299
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:00,240
Little Zhuyu.

300
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:02,240
Stop reading. Work is done for the day.

301
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:04,120
Put down your files.

302
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,880
- Young Master Xie.
- Young Master Xie

303
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:12,480
Xie Loubai, the Xie family's fifth son

304
00:19:13,160 --> 00:19:14,600
Young Master Xie.

305
00:19:14,680 --> 00:19:15,840
It's Genius Xie.

306
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:18,120
His poems are amazing.

307
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,520
Some people
pay a lot of money for his poems.

308
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:21,600
Little Zhuyu.

309
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,600
That's the worst of the Xie family.

310
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:26,480
He's the fifth son, Xie Loubai.

311
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,640
Four years ago,
he pursued Wu Zhen.

312
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:33,600
Xiaosi.

313
00:19:33,720 --> 00:19:35,120
I'll take a look over there.

314
00:19:35,520 --> 00:19:36,520
All right.

315
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:52,720
The Mei family?

316
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,960
Which branch is this young gentleman from?

317
00:19:55,040 --> 00:19:56,560
Why haven't I seen him before?

318
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,000
Do the Mei family men have
to report to the Xie family now?

319
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:02,600
Judging from his appearance,
he's quite handsome.

320
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:04,640
Could it be that
you just brought him along

321
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,400
to fill the numbers?

322
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:08,240
He's probably some household servant.

323
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,720
That's right.

324
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:11,800
Did you eat crap for lunch?

325
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:13,200
Your mouth smells awful.

326
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:17,160
I'm from a side branch of the Mei family,

327
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:19,360
sharing a great-grandfather with Mei Si.

328
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,080
A side branch of the Mei family?

329
00:20:21,160 --> 00:20:23,920
I heard a young guy did come
to Chang'an not long ago.

330
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:27,320
Are you the one who passed
the Bureau of Mystic Investigations exam?

331
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,240
That's me.

332
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:31,840
I never thought their family
had even more unlucky folks.

333
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,000
What nonsense is that?

334
00:20:35,720 --> 00:20:37,960
The bureau has been
practically defunct for decades.

335
00:20:38,520 --> 00:20:40,080
Joining the bureau

336
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:41,960
might mess up his future.

337
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,800
Well, one must have
a future to be messed up.

338
00:20:45,640 --> 00:20:47,480
Choose your people wisely.

339
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,120
Don't make Lady Wu unhappy.

340
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:50,880
She might think

341
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:53,560
your family's friendship
with the Wu family is only for show

342
00:20:53,640 --> 00:20:57,000
if you bring such riffraff to fool her.

343
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:58,640
What do you mean by that?

344
00:20:58,720 --> 00:21:01,400
You'd better watch your mouth.

345
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:03,920
Either the Mei family
is trying to fool Lady Wu

346
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,760
or this guy has his own plans,

347
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:08,720
thinking he can use his looks
to get Lady Wu

348
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:11,400
to spend a couple of nights with him

349
00:21:11,480 --> 00:21:12,600
and score some favors.

350
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,160
Speaking of favors,

351
00:21:15,400 --> 00:21:16,960
Lady Wu is holding a banquet today.

352
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,640
As you eat and drink,
mind your manners.

353
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:25,960
A distant branch of the Mei family

354
00:21:26,040 --> 00:21:28,120
dares to speak to us like this?

355
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:30,680
Looks like the Mei family
is lax in raising their kids.

356
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:32,040
It's fine.

357
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:33,600
Our family is happy to step in.

358
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,160
No, what are you trying to do?

359
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:39,240
Let go of me!

360
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,760
You.

361
00:21:41,720 --> 00:21:43,480
Go teach him a lesson.

362
00:21:44,920 --> 00:21:46,200
Me?

363
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Mm-hmm.

364
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:29,160
What are you doing, Young Master Xie?

365
00:22:29,960 --> 00:22:32,680
Are you bullying someone
at my birthday banquet?

366
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:41,960
Lady Wu, please don't say that.

367
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:43,920
We were only having a conversation.

368
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,040
Too bad,

369
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:48,280
this young man
seems inexperienced in the world.

370
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:51,560
He's full of suspicion
and quick to speak harshly.

371
00:22:51,640 --> 00:22:53,560
He shows no respect at all.

372
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:00,320
Why should he respect you?

373
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,880
The person I like
doesn't have to respect you.

374
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:07,880
Lady Wu, are you joking?

375
00:23:07,960 --> 00:23:09,280
I'm not joking.

376
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:11,120
Didn't you just say it yourself

377
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:14,360
that my husband
is better-looking than you?

378
00:23:14,440 --> 00:23:16,760
I didn't say he's better-looking.

379
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,920
So you know you can't compare to him.

380
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:20,880
Apologize to Young Master Mei then.

381
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:24,000
Apologize? Why should I?

382
00:23:24,560 --> 00:23:25,560
What?

383
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:28,560
Do you want to get kicked out

384
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,160
just like the young marquis?

385
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:38,120
This servant took matters
into his own hands.

386
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:39,240
It has nothing to do with me.

387
00:23:39,840 --> 00:23:41,760
I'll leave him to you, Lady Wu.

388
00:23:52,040 --> 00:23:53,080
Come here.

389
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:02,920
- Mei Xiaosi.
- Hmm?

390
00:24:03,000 --> 00:24:05,600
That pretty and delicate young man

391
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:06,960
has caught Wu Zhen's eye.

392
00:24:07,440 --> 00:24:08,880
Little Zhuyu

393
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:12,160
is about to turn into a phoenix.

394
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:26,680
Young Master Mei.

395
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,400
Your Highness.

396
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,640
You can call me Lady Wu.

397
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:34,600
I just helped you out.

398
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:36,440
Aren't you going to thank me?

399
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,720
Thank you, Lady Wu.

400
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:43,440
But this servant was forced to do it.

401
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:45,360
Please don't give him
a hard time.

402
00:24:45,440 --> 00:24:46,720
You're so kind.

403
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:51,120
Forget it.
Let's just say you did me a favor.

404
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:52,400
What?

405
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:55,640
They like to talk nonsense,

406
00:24:56,200 --> 00:24:57,560
but one thing they said

407
00:24:58,680 --> 00:24:59,760
was spot on.

408
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,920
You've got the kind of looks

409
00:25:04,360 --> 00:25:06,000
that could fool people.

410
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,800
Unfortunately, I have a date tonight.

411
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,200
Let's have tea another day.

412
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:13,480
- No need.
- Goodbye.

413
00:25:18,600 --> 00:25:20,640
By the way, what's your name again?

414
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:24,280
I'm Mei Zhuyu.

415
00:25:25,520 --> 00:25:27,120
<i>Mei Zhuyu.</i>

416
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:35,360
Did I let you go?

417
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:42,440
That young man said I was forced to do it,

418
00:25:42,520 --> 00:25:44,080
so he won't blame me.

419
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,600
He doesn't blame you, but I do.

420
00:25:51,080 --> 00:25:54,080
Today's banquet was for you.

421
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:58,080
I don't know
what you're talking about.

422
00:25:58,320 --> 00:25:59,800
I have to go now.

423
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,440
Stop pretending.

424
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,560
I've been observing.

425
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:05,440
<i>Among all the guests,</i>

426
00:26:06,080 --> 00:26:08,120
<i>you looked the most suspicious.</i>

427
00:26:10,120 --> 00:26:12,200
I suddenly aimed my arrow at you.

428
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:13,600
An ordinary person

429
00:26:14,160 --> 00:26:15,920
would've instinctively dodged,

430
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:20,120
but you stayed perfectly calm.

431
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:29,960
I was stunned for a moment due to fear.

432
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,160
That's because you knew

433
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:38,600
the arrow couldn't hurt you.

434
00:26:39,760 --> 00:26:42,240
Aren't you curious why I noticed that?

435
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,560
Well, I might as well tell you.

436
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:49,600
I'm not just Lady Wu.

437
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:00,040
You ran away when we fought yesterday.

438
00:27:00,680 --> 00:27:02,120
So at today's banquet,

439
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,080
I told the guests to wear gold and silver
to lure you into showing yourself.

440
00:27:06,160 --> 00:27:08,080
The one you met yesterday wasn't me.

441
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:11,200
You're still playing dumb.

442
00:27:11,880 --> 00:27:13,200
Don't think about running away today.

443
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:16,840
Little Zhuyu.

444
00:27:16,920 --> 00:27:18,760
Today's wine is good, right?

445
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:21,120
Will you still go to banquets
with me next time?

446
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,160
- Slow down.
- Hmm?

447
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:27,040
What's that sound?

448
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:28,840
Huh?

449
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,760
Hey.

450
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:55,560
Are you that impatient?

451
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,120
Can't you wait for another day?

452
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
No. I thought I heard…

453
00:27:59,960 --> 00:28:01,360
Lady Wu, are you all right?

454
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,360
Yes, I couldn't be better.

455
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:06,720
I'm sorry to disturb you.

456
00:28:14,920 --> 00:28:16,200
Young Master Mei.

457
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:19,920
Why are you here?

458
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,040
What?
Are you into this sort of thing?

459
00:28:27,680 --> 00:28:29,160
Do you want to join in?

460
00:28:40,160 --> 00:28:41,960
- Young Master Mei Si.
- Young Master Mei Si.

461
00:28:42,040 --> 00:28:43,840
Why are you drinking so much today?

462
00:28:43,920 --> 00:28:45,800
I'm not drunk.

463
00:29:02,920 --> 00:29:05,600
Record Library

464
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,560
<i>No wonder</i>
<i>they say this place is eerie.</i>

465
00:30:51,400 --> 00:30:52,960
<i>It's infested with mildew and rot.</i>

466
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:56,120
<i>Chang'an is truly bustling</i>

467
00:30:57,040 --> 00:30:58,320
<i>with spirits and demons.</i>

468
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,320
With spiritual power unleashed,

469
00:31:27,960 --> 00:31:29,120
all evil shall submit.

470
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:03,040
- This is not bad.
- Take a look.

471
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,760
Fu Zhao

472
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:20,160
Welcome to Chang'an's Demon Underworld.

473
00:33:23,360 --> 00:33:25,960
Chang'an isn't a place for you
to wreak havoc.

474
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,440
Don't even think about it.

475
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:31,600
Although I'm here,
I've never hurt innocent people.

476
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:33,440
How could you say that?

477
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:35,920
I saw you hurting someone two days ago.

478
00:33:36,320 --> 00:33:37,320
That wasn't me.

479
00:33:37,400 --> 00:33:38,520
That wasn't you?

480
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,320
It must have been my imagination then.

481
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:43,000
I know someone has been
tracking her down in Chang'an.

482
00:33:43,080 --> 00:33:44,400
I've been looking for her too.

483
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,560
Her?

484
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,600
Speak clearly.

485
00:33:48,200 --> 00:33:50,320
Do you know what my true form is?

486
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:21,800
Come out.

487
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:33,280
Wu Zi Shu, Cat Lord's Assistant

488
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,680
Every time you're upset,
you hide up there.

489
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:36,840
That's nothing new.

490
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,000
Now you're unexpected.

491
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,120
You catch demons in the Mortal Realm
without telling me.

492
00:34:42,840 --> 00:34:44,000
Tell me.

493
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,000
Why didn't you hand over the bat demon?

494
00:34:47,440 --> 00:34:49,960
Because the murderer is someone else.

495
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,040
Look.

496
00:34:54,400 --> 00:34:55,520
Earrings?

497
00:34:56,720 --> 00:34:58,440
They always come in pairs.

498
00:34:59,320 --> 00:35:01,840
Even these bat-patterned ones
have a male and a female.

499
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:04,880
The male attended the banquet,
while the female caused trouble.

500
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,480
The reason she attacked
those wearing gold ornaments

501
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,440
was to search for her lost partner.

502
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,400
Even a tiny earring

503
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:20,320
can transform into a spirit,
gaining a soul of its own.

504
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,440
Based on what he said,

505
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,640
they were forged into earrings
in the previous dynasty

506
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:27,760
and worn by people.

507
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,040
Nourished by human spiritual energy,

508
00:35:30,120 --> 00:35:31,160
they became spirits.

509
00:35:31,240 --> 00:35:32,240
That's right.

510
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:34,280
For a century, we have lived side by side

511
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:35,720
as companions.

512
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:36,800
Half a month ago,

513
00:35:36,880 --> 00:35:39,600
we first arrived in Chang'an
and saw how lively it was.

514
00:35:41,360 --> 00:35:43,480
I thought I'd take the chance to explore.

515
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:46,440
When strange incidents
began happening in Chang'an,

516
00:35:46,520 --> 00:35:48,400
I finally realized Fu Xi

517
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,520
was going out of her way to find me.

518
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:52,280
I used to think

519
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,840
she simply had an obsession with gold.

520
00:35:56,080 --> 00:35:57,520
So she was looking for you.

521
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:01,520
But last night,
why did you show up at Ruyi Pavilion?

522
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:04,200
Bats have good hearing.

523
00:36:04,640 --> 00:36:07,160
I heard her voice near Ruyi Pavilion,

524
00:36:07,240 --> 00:36:10,520
so I wanted to tell her in person
to leave me be and stop causing harm.

525
00:36:10,600 --> 00:36:12,960
So I posed as a servant
and slipped into the banquet.

526
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:16,080
I'll check the guests
who attended the banquet again.

527
00:36:16,680 --> 00:36:17,680
There's no need.

528
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:20,800
That female bat has likely
already possessed someone else.

529
00:36:21,280 --> 00:36:22,640
Thinking back to the day we fought,

530
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:25,080
she had probably already lost control.

531
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:26,960
If we don't find her soon,

532
00:36:27,440 --> 00:36:29,840
more trouble is bound to follow.

533
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:33,400
When a demon falls into madness,
one must be extremely cautious.

534
00:36:33,480 --> 00:36:34,600
Xiaozhen.

535
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,240
You're a half-demon.

536
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:37,960
You have no power during the day.

537
00:36:38,520 --> 00:36:39,680
I know.

538
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,160
Luckily, bats sleep during the day
and come out at night.

539
00:36:43,720 --> 00:36:45,080
I'll wait until night.

540
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,240
It's all my fault.

541
00:36:47,720 --> 00:36:48,880
My demon power is weak.

542
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:50,440
I can't help you much.

543
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,000
Of course, you can help me.

544
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:54,160
Shu.

545
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,200
Can you go to
Bureau of Mystic Investigations with me?

546
00:36:57,920 --> 00:36:58,960
Certainly.

547
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:02,400
Bureau Of Mystic Investigations

548
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:07,440
This is top-grade tea.
Please try it, Your Highness.

549
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:18,240
It's not bad.

550
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:19,840
Nieli.

551
00:37:20,240 --> 00:37:21,800
Do you think County Princess Qinghe

552
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:24,200
really came here
over missing gold and silver?

553
00:37:24,760 --> 00:37:26,800
Well, it's hard to say.

554
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:31,400
I get the feeling
her real interest lies in Zhuyu.

555
00:37:31,480 --> 00:37:34,200
What exactly does she fancy about him?

556
00:37:35,680 --> 00:37:36,840
His looks?

557
00:37:41,840 --> 00:37:43,800
Is Young Master Mei avoiding me?

558
00:37:45,000 --> 00:37:46,000
Uh…

559
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:47,640
You think too much.

560
00:37:47,720 --> 00:37:50,240
How could he possibly dare avoid you?

561
00:37:51,080 --> 00:37:52,080
Come here.

562
00:37:54,840 --> 00:37:55,960
Come here.

563
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,960
We first met last night,
and I felt quite a connection with you.

564
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,640
But you're so heartless.

565
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:06,920
You know I've lost my gold and silver,

566
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:08,400
but you didn't even comfort me.

567
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,160
Please tell us what happened.

568
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:12,720
We'll do our best.

569
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,400
What?

570
00:38:15,840 --> 00:38:19,320
Is that brief, offhand remark of yours
meant to be a comfort?

571
00:38:19,400 --> 00:38:20,400
Mm.

572
00:38:24,640 --> 00:38:26,520
Move aside.

573
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:29,440
With Your Highness gracing us today,

574
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:32,400
our bureau is basking in honor.

575
00:38:32,480 --> 00:38:35,160
Whatever concerns you,
concerns Mr. Mei as well.

576
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:37,280
He'll surely spare no effort

577
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:38,520
to see you satisfied.

578
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,760
Bi Tao, Xiangsi House

579
00:38:50,320 --> 00:38:51,640
<i>Xiangsi House?</i>

580
00:38:58,200 --> 00:38:59,400
Lady Wu, what brings you out?

581
00:38:59,480 --> 00:39:00,680
I came to see you.

582
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:02,760
Perfect timing.

583
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,160
What? Did you happen to miss me?

584
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:08,800
Since you reported
losing gold and silver last night,

585
00:39:09,360 --> 00:39:11,880
the rules require a written complaint.

586
00:39:12,440 --> 00:39:13,960
Can't you write it for me?

587
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,280
By the rules, it has to be
in your own handwriting.

588
00:39:44,920 --> 00:39:46,240
<i>I have to think of a way</i>

589
00:39:46,320 --> 00:39:48,480
<i>to make him leave.</i>

590
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,480
I'm a bit hungry.

591
00:39:51,560 --> 00:39:53,080
Please cook something for me.

592
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,360
What do you want to eat?

593
00:39:54,440 --> 00:39:55,480
Anything is fine.

594
00:39:55,560 --> 00:39:56,560
Something complicated.

595
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:12,120
<i>The recent mysterious cases</i>

596
00:40:12,200 --> 00:40:14,680
<i>are piled up</i>
<i>in the Bureau of Mystic Investigations.</i>

597
00:40:14,760 --> 00:40:19,040
<i>Perhaps I can find some clues</i>
<i>in the case files.</i>

598
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:42,560
Shu, go.

599
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:55,000
Lady Wu, what are you doing?

600
00:40:56,760 --> 00:40:58,800
I'm checking out your workplace.

601
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:03,000
Lady Wu, this is an official site.

602
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,840
I'm afraid it's a bit inconvenient.

603
00:41:05,440 --> 00:41:07,680
Why don't you eat in Commander Xu's room?

604
00:41:20,600 --> 00:41:21,680
I'm sorry.

605
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:22,880
I got your clothes dirty.

606
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:27,640
I'm hungry and dizzy.

607
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:32,160
It's fine. Let's eat.

608
00:41:33,480 --> 00:41:34,480
Hmm.

609
00:41:48,560 --> 00:41:50,120
Have you changed your clothes?

610
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,000
Since you're in the room,

611
00:42:06,080 --> 00:42:07,480
why didn't you open the door?

612
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,840
I'm too lazy to get out of bed.

613
00:42:16,440 --> 00:42:18,240
I've written the complaint for you.

614
00:42:18,320 --> 00:42:20,680
Just have Commander Xu stamp it later.

615
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:31,160
Didn't you say that

616
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:33,000
it must be in my own handwriting?

617
00:42:33,560 --> 00:42:37,280
I think you're too lazy to write it,
so I've made an exception this time.

618
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:39,600
My sister once reminded me

619
00:42:39,680 --> 00:42:43,040
that in life,
one must never take a wrong step.

620
00:42:44,640 --> 00:42:45,720
Do you know why?

621
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,360
Why?

622
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,400
Because once you make a mistake
and make an exception,

623
00:42:51,480 --> 00:42:53,040
you'll do it again.

624
00:42:53,120 --> 00:42:56,200
Just like how once you've broken
the rules for the first time,

625
00:42:56,280 --> 00:42:57,640
there will always be a second.

626
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:02,000
There won't be a next time.

627
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:07,400
I heard on my way here that

628
00:43:08,440 --> 00:43:10,320
the road outside your place
is in terrible shape.

629
00:43:10,400 --> 00:43:12,800
It's long, narrow, and muddy.

630
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:14,640
No carriage can get through.

631
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:16,320
Your donkey cart

632
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:18,360
was left at a neighbor's
by the crossroads.

633
00:43:19,360 --> 00:43:20,600
I'm very curious.

634
00:43:21,120 --> 00:43:24,280
Bureau of Mystic Investigations
has neither money nor prospects,

635
00:43:24,880 --> 00:43:26,480
so why do you still choose to stay?

636
00:43:27,480 --> 00:43:29,520
To root out evil and uphold justice.

637
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:31,840
No matter where I work, it's the same.

638
00:43:33,000 --> 00:43:35,120
All that matters is doing my job right.

639
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,160
To root out evil…

640
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:42,920
and uphold justice?

641
00:43:44,240 --> 00:43:46,600
Looks like you really want
to be a true gentleman.

642
00:43:51,640 --> 00:43:52,760
Unlike me.

643
00:43:52,840 --> 00:43:56,320
I only care about eating, drinking,
and having fun day and night.

644
00:43:56,400 --> 00:43:57,960
Everyone in Chang'an fears me,

645
00:43:58,520 --> 00:43:59,640
curses me,

646
00:43:59,720 --> 00:44:01,920
and whispers about me behind my back,

647
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:03,640
but I pay them no heed.

648
00:44:04,640 --> 00:44:06,120
Without knowing one's hardships,

649
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:10,360
how can they follow the crowd
and judge so easily?
