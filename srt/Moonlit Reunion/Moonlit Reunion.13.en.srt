00:01:27,272 --> 00:01:31,030
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,114 --> 00:01:34,000
(Episode 13)

3
00:02:22,159 --> 00:02:23,440
You're leaving the door open.

4
00:02:23,671 --> 00:02:25,151
Aren't you afraid I'll catch a chill?

5
00:02:29,768 --> 00:02:31,101
It's summer.

6
00:02:31,248 --> 00:02:33,488
The temperature is just right after the rain last night.

7
00:02:33,719 --> 00:02:36,079
I suppose if you hadn't been caught in the rain last night,

8
00:02:36,206 --> 00:02:37,520
you wouldn't have a fever.

9
00:02:37,814 --> 00:02:39,647
Did you stay up all night taking care of me?

10
00:02:41,391 --> 00:02:42,840
I just read a few books.

11
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:45,120
What kind of books?

12
00:02:46,262 --> 00:02:47,400
Were they good?

13
00:02:48,038 --> 00:02:49,078
They were okay.

14
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,536
Why just okay?

15
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,320
I don't understand.

16
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:57,061
Why do all these stories always end with

17
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:00,312
a beautiful couple, a perfect marriage,

18
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,432
and a lifetime of love until old age?

19
00:03:03,176 --> 00:03:07,808
But aren't these kinds of stories supposed to have a happy ending?

20
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:11,553
Is marriage the only happy ending?

21
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:15,160
If the whole point of the story is just to get married,

22
00:03:15,319 --> 00:03:17,192
with the women having nothing else to do,

23
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,200
and their lives after marriage brushed over in a few lines,

24
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:23,472
it makes their whole life seem a bit rushed and insignificant.

25
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:29,993
If someone heard you say that,

26
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,553
they'd probably call you

27
00:03:32,919 --> 00:03:35,553
arrogant, acting like you're wiser than everyone else.

28
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:38,032
I'm only sharing it with you.

29
00:04:00,346 --> 00:04:01,459
Do you feel better?

30
00:04:16,360 --> 00:04:17,400
Is it still hot?

31
00:04:23,966 --> 00:04:24,966
The fever is gone.

32
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:44,520
Hurry up.

33
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:00,000
That's enough.

34
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:07,240
Why are you smiling?

35
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:08,800
Nothing.

36
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:13,559
I just suddenly feel like everything is good.

37
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,593
Then eat more.

38
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:22,154
Looks like Lady Wu Zhen has her hands full.

39
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:23,993
Sit down and eat with us.

40
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:25,952
I don't think we're in the mood.

41
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:35,113
I just remembered, I need to go to Ruyi Pavilion.

42
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:38,153
Ming Zhuang, make sure Mr. Mei takes his medicine.

43
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,392
Don't worry, Lady Wu Zhen.

44
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:50,192
By the way, Mr. Mei, when you leave later,

45
00:05:50,439 --> 00:05:52,312
do watch the second step outside the door.

46
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:54,793
I broke it once while practicing archery with Zhen.

47
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:58,233
We fixed it, but it's still not very steady

48
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:00,072
and people trip on it a lot.

49
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:11,074
I'll be heading out as well.

50
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,240
What's going on?

51
00:06:25,321 --> 00:06:26,874
There's a big hole in the barrier.

52
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,873
Since last night, several mortals have accidentally wandered in,

53
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:32,760
and some little demons have slipped out.

54
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:35,553
Serpent Lord can't handle it alone and needs our help.

55
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:41,356
Mr. Mei, here's the medicine the Princess prepared for you,

56
00:06:41,439 --> 00:06:42,632
and a sweet to take after.

57
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:01,872
I'll take the sweets then.

58
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,352
Alright, but don't eat too many of them.

59
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,312
Zhu Yu, Chang'an is always bustling.

60
00:07:25,839 --> 00:07:29,512
Do you think this Demon Market really exists?

61
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:32,039
The legend of the Demon Market might seem far-fetched,

62
00:07:32,279 --> 00:07:33,639
but there's no smoke without fire.

63
00:07:33,959 --> 00:07:35,353
If the Demon Market really exists,

64
00:07:35,640 --> 00:07:38,274
it makes sense that it would be hard to find.

65
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:42,392
If it's that hard to find, where do we even begin looking?

66
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:48,799
Haven't you noticed something is off about Chang'an tonight?

67
00:07:54,279 --> 00:07:55,432
Seems pretty normal to me.

68
00:07:55,640 --> 00:07:57,514
Everyone's gone home to sleep since it's late.

69
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,632
I mean, the celestial phenomena were strange last night.

70
00:08:03,959 --> 00:08:05,119
It might be caused by demons.

71
00:08:05,906 --> 00:08:06,906
Demons?

72
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:08,360
That's impossible.

73
00:08:08,726 --> 00:08:10,040
I've been all over Chang'an

74
00:08:11,439 --> 00:08:13,312
and haven't sensed anything unusual.

75
00:08:15,880 --> 00:08:18,773
Fourth Brother said he saw something, didn't he?

76
00:08:24,271 --> 00:08:26,600
(Liu District)

77
00:08:32,840 --> 00:08:34,113
Is it really here?

78
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:36,620
Commissioner Mei.

79
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:37,800
Deputy Commander Huang.

80
00:08:38,466 --> 00:08:40,579
Commissioner Mei, where are you headed?

81
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:44,833
My cousin just arrived in Chang'an. I'm showing him around.

82
00:08:47,638 --> 00:08:48,918
Showing him around Liu District?

83
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,800
It's still part of Chang'an's charm.

84
00:08:51,559 --> 00:08:52,792
Understand.

85
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:59,193
Still, I'd advise you both to go elsewhere else.

86
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,960
Why?

87
00:09:03,240 --> 00:09:05,640
Recently, Liu District has been awash with a forbidden drug.

88
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:08,872
It's harmful to people, but we can't seem to stop it.

89
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:11,872
We wanted to seal off the place and investigate,

90
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,316
but there are too many aristocrats and officials frequenting the place.

91
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:17,559
We can't really block it off.

92
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:21,512
In that case, we won't intrude.

93
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:22,600
Goodbye.

94
00:09:22,919 --> 00:09:24,593
Have a good night, Commissioner Mei.

95
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,277
Didn't Deputy Commander Huang say he wasn't blocking Liu District?

96
00:09:46,360 --> 00:09:47,632
We could've just walked in.

97
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,593
Why did we have to pretend to leave and then secretly come back?

98
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:54,194
It's not that they don't want to stop us, but they can't.

99
00:09:54,759 --> 00:09:56,512
Deputy Commander Huang is Lady Wu's friend.

100
00:09:56,879 --> 00:09:58,313
I don't want to cause him trouble.

101
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:00,432
That fox spirit again.

102
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:04,480
Do you have the things I asked you to bring?

103
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,486
Why the disguise?

104
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:16,897
I'm the Commissioner of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

105
00:10:16,921 --> 00:10:20,075
It's hard to explain why an imperial official would show up here.

106
00:10:22,073 --> 00:10:23,073
I got it.

107
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:28,000
What's this?

108
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:29,240
Jiuyin Pill.

109
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:31,840
After you take it, it changes your voice for four hours

110
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:34,833
so no one can recognize your voice.

111
00:10:34,960 --> 00:10:36,553
It's one of my prized treasures.

112
00:10:37,280 --> 00:10:38,280
I...

113
00:10:41,357 --> 00:10:42,397
What's happening?

114
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:47,255
Isn't it supposed to change your voice?

115
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:48,593
Why can't you talk now?

116
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:49,912
Forget it.

117
00:10:51,160 --> 00:10:54,193
Your treasures are always full of surprises.

118
00:10:54,400 --> 00:10:55,472
What else have you got?

119
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,712
Don't worry, Brother Mei. There's no way this will go wrong.

120
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:03,792
Take a look. Simple, effective, and works instantly.

121
00:11:03,879 --> 00:11:05,752
I guarantee it's foolproof.

122
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:16,673
That's the 18th already.

123
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:19,433
What kind of demon magic is this old rat using?

124
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,353
He's causing so much trouble.

125
00:11:21,799 --> 00:11:23,912
What rules did Serpent Lord lay down?

126
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:27,953
As usual, erase the mortals' memories first.

127
00:11:28,239 --> 00:11:29,396
Ling Xiao and Zhu Ying

128
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,713
are busy recapturing the demons who have slipped out.

129
00:11:32,799 --> 00:11:33,839
Good.

130
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:39,353
Once the barrier is sealed and no mortals can get through,

131
00:11:39,953 --> 00:11:41,873
we'll move on to fix things in the mortal world.

132
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,552
That will be good enough.

133
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:44,880
Yes.

134
00:11:48,960 --> 00:11:50,593
Greetings, Cat Lord, Lady Hu Zhu.

135
00:11:50,879 --> 00:11:53,272
We've found another suspicious place.

136
00:12:05,679 --> 00:12:06,953
The Skin Shop?

137
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:10,473
It's a place that sells skins.

138
00:12:36,840 --> 00:12:39,037
Alright, go search somewhere else.

139
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,120
Yes, Lady Hu Zhu.

140
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,392
Where did that old calligrapher run off to for a nap?

141
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,834
It feels so real.

142
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,000
Indeed.

143
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:33,793
Each one is hand-drawn and imbued with demon magic,

144
00:13:33,880 --> 00:13:35,160
so they look completely genuine.

145
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,872
I heard that young demons whose bodies haven't fully formed yet,

146
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,833
especially those who yearn for beauty,

147
00:13:45,399 --> 00:13:49,833
will rent or buy a handmade skin here.

148
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:54,073
If you're willing to pay a lot, you can even have one custom-made.

149
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:55,200
That's right.

150
00:13:55,281 --> 00:13:57,678
You can choose everything from hair color to skin tone,

151
00:13:57,760 --> 00:13:59,135
and all your facial features and limbs.

152
00:13:59,159 --> 00:14:02,159
You can even try them on in the mortal world and pay once you're satisfied.

153
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,152
Boss, since you're a demon already in human form,

154
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:07,560
you probably aren't too familiar with the Skin Shop.

155
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,879
It's really hard for us demons to turn into human form.

156
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:14,473
Some of us who do manage to transform end up looking ugly and unnatural.

157
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:17,514
After all, not every demon is as good-looking as me.

158
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:34,272
Okay, I'll handle things here.

159
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:36,672
Go and check if there are any other breaches.

160
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,100
By the way, Boss, you have to be careful.

161
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,880
That across the street is Liu District.

162
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,912
With your reputation, you don't want to be seen going in there.

163
00:14:49,098 --> 00:14:50,532
Which pleasure house is that?

164
00:14:51,046 --> 00:14:52,126
Yunong House.

165
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,272
Their business has never been very reputable.

166
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,593
It's all shady and messy.

167
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:21,720
Are you sure you don't want to wear a mask?

168
00:15:21,906 --> 00:15:23,618
No. It would be too stuffy.

169
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:28,033
Besides, I love showing my face when I'm out and about.

170
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:33,440
That demon shadow that Fourth Brother mentioned

171
00:15:33,799 --> 00:15:35,752
appeared near Liu District, right?

172
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:37,160
Exactly.

173
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:39,074
Where is everyone?

174
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:41,993
Where did all the people go?

175
00:15:43,600 --> 00:15:45,676
Where is everyone? How strange.

176
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,272
Where are all the women?

177
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:17,697
- What a fine-looking young man. - No, I'm not here for fun.

178
00:16:17,721 --> 00:16:18,914
I'm not here to have fun.

179
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:21,954
Beautiful one, I've come for you.

180
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:23,440
Beautiful...

181
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:25,680
Where is the beauty?

182
00:16:36,519 --> 00:16:37,593
Beauty?

183
00:16:37,919 --> 00:16:38,919
Right here...

184
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:44,519
This is...

185
00:16:46,799 --> 00:16:47,839
Wushi Powder?

186
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:56,433
Sir, it seems you've wandered in by mistake.

187
00:16:58,600 --> 00:16:59,680
What is this place?

188
00:17:00,360 --> 00:17:03,274
Here? Just an empty room of Yunong House.

189
00:17:12,719 --> 00:17:13,759
What's that sound?

190
00:17:14,686 --> 00:17:15,726
Nothing.

191
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:19,279
- I'll go check inside. - You mustn't.

192
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:22,072
Why not?

193
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,353
A demon.

194
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,112
Did you see the fan he gave me?

195
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,236
Why is Young Master Sun lying here?

196
00:17:55,319 --> 00:17:56,393
Someone, quick!

197
00:17:56,839 --> 00:17:59,112
Young Master! Young Master, wake up! Young Master!

198
00:17:59,932 --> 00:18:01,645
Wake up. Are you alright?

199
00:18:01,726 --> 00:18:03,039
What beauty?

200
00:18:03,279 --> 00:18:05,473
He's probably overdosed on Wushi Powder again.

201
00:18:06,039 --> 00:18:07,312
Help him up first.

202
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:09,840
Come.

203
00:18:10,672 --> 00:18:11,672
Slow down.

204
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,080
What happened?

205
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,552
A mortal wandered in and got suspicious.

206
00:18:44,359 --> 00:18:45,832
Zhen, what are you playing at?

207
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:47,119
I'm not playing!

208
00:18:55,233 --> 00:18:56,233
Are you okay?

209
00:18:56,799 --> 00:18:58,535
What happened to the mortal who wandered in?

210
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,913
Nothing. I erased his memories and tossed him out.

211
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,716
Who kicked me just now?

212
00:19:07,799 --> 00:19:09,032
I'll kill him!

213
00:19:17,759 --> 00:19:19,832
Chang'an is so scary.

214
00:19:20,039 --> 00:19:21,272
Good thing I ran fast.

215
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:28,840
Zhu Yu, let's go back to the mountain.

216
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,754
This is no place for humans.

217
00:19:31,558 --> 00:19:32,558
Indeed.

218
00:19:33,360 --> 00:19:35,393
This is no place for humans.

219
00:19:44,165 --> 00:19:46,496
The barrier has finally been mended after working all night.

220
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:49,152
With the new weaving spell, it's much stronger than before.

221
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:54,000
Wu Zhen.

222
00:19:58,019 --> 00:19:59,373
Mr. Shu.

223
00:19:59,920 --> 00:20:01,713
Huang Yi, what are you doing here?

224
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:04,896
Recently, that forbidden drug Wushi Powder has resurfaced in Chang'an.

225
00:20:04,920 --> 00:20:08,072
I've been leading a search for days.

226
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,592
Wushi Powder?

227
00:20:10,606 --> 00:20:11,766
I've got to get back to work.

228
00:20:12,279 --> 00:20:13,433
You two be careful.

229
00:20:15,372 --> 00:20:16,412
Oh, by the way,

230
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:19,400
Wu Zhen,

231
00:20:19,858 --> 00:20:21,136
I have some news for you.

232
00:20:21,280 --> 00:20:22,360
Go ahead.

233
00:20:23,119 --> 00:20:25,153
That Young Master Mei from your place,

234
00:20:26,879 --> 00:20:29,915
is he still staying at your residence lately?

235
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
Yes.

236
00:20:31,081 --> 00:20:33,514
Do you know where he was yesterday?

237
00:20:34,120 --> 00:20:35,593
At the Duke's Manor, of course.

238
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:38,994
See how naive you are?

239
00:20:40,127 --> 00:20:43,673
Young Master Mei tried to go to Liu District last night.

240
00:20:43,759 --> 00:20:46,792
Luckily, I stopped him.

241
00:20:47,119 --> 00:20:48,832
I prevented him from going astray.

242
00:20:49,519 --> 00:20:50,752
That's brotherhood.

243
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:52,673
Do you mean

244
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:54,913
he was going to a brothel?

245
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,920
I don't believe it.

246
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:58,752
Zhen, you seem to trust him a lot.

247
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,756
He's not that kind of person.

248
00:21:01,839 --> 00:21:03,352
He wouldn't do something like that.

249
00:21:06,319 --> 00:21:07,319
Wu Zhen.

250
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:10,752
You've met plenty of men over the years.

251
00:21:10,839 --> 00:21:12,832
When have you ever trusted someone so much?

252
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,872
Why do you believe everything he says?

253
00:21:16,519 --> 00:21:19,352
Men by nature grow tired of the old and crave the new.

254
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,119
Old?

255
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:24,713
Are you two already tired of me?

256
00:21:25,519 --> 00:21:30,112
- I... - Human nature isn't defined by gender.

257
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:32,680
That's true.

258
00:21:32,761 --> 00:21:33,761
Never mind.

259
00:21:34,005 --> 00:21:35,416
As long as you know where you stand.

260
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,993
I'll be off.

261
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:39,880
Zhen.

262
00:21:40,880 --> 00:21:42,240
Do you really trust him that much?

263
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,472
Yes, just as I trust you.

264
00:22:22,079 --> 00:22:23,200
- Shu. - Wu Zhi Shu.

265
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:24,320
Wu Zhi Shu.

266
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,840
What's wrong?

267
00:22:35,800 --> 00:22:36,800
What do you want?

268
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:44,040
If you and I work together, we can do whatever we want.

269
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:45,797
Lord Qiang Yi.

270
00:22:45,880 --> 00:22:49,592
I'm not, I have nothing to do with you.

271
00:22:49,680 --> 00:22:52,153
Nothing to do?

272
00:22:53,119 --> 00:22:56,673
Have you forgotten the past?

273
00:22:57,952 --> 00:22:59,680
Back then,

274
00:23:00,016 --> 00:23:03,009
when my bones were buried in the dirt,

275
00:23:03,599 --> 00:23:06,272
scattered and gone,

276
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:09,437
I spent all my strength,

277
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:13,512
moving inch by inch,

278
00:23:13,759 --> 00:23:19,679
to get them to break through the ground again and return to this world.

279
00:23:27,799 --> 00:23:30,160
- It's raining outside. Let's go in. - Okay.

280
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,520
Here.

281
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,873
Boss, I want a duck, chop it fine.

282
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:59,920
All of this was fated.

283
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,993
I'm destined to return to the mortal world.

284
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,512
And you, as an ancient military book,

285
00:25:07,799 --> 00:25:12,119
your destiny cannot be forsaken.

286
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,600
A letter from Eldest Senior Brother.

287
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:37,040
(Arcane Appraisal Bureau)

288
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:41,015
(I heard of the demon chaos in Chang'an, and that you're gravely wounded.)

289
00:25:41,039 --> 00:25:43,159
(I hope you two can return quickly to discuss a plan)

290
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,160
(to eliminate the demons in Chang'an.)

291
00:25:46,224 --> 00:25:48,600
What do you think, Brother Mei? Let's set off as soon as possible.

292
00:25:48,624 --> 00:25:50,660
Then we'll come back with our brothers,

293
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,479
kill those demons, and avenge you as well.

294
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,575
Changxi Palace has lived in seclusion for 100 years.

295
00:25:54,599 --> 00:25:57,439
It won't be that easy to return to Chang'an now.

296
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,376
Since Senior Brother brought it up, he must have thought it through.

297
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,236
Besides, it's our mission as disciples of

298
00:26:03,319 --> 00:26:04,832
Changxi Palace to vanquish demons.

299
00:26:04,913 --> 00:26:06,496
It doesn't matter if we've been in seclusion

300
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,815
for 100 years, or even 1000 years.

301
00:26:07,839 --> 00:26:09,199
We can't shirk our responsibility.

302
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,153
I went into the Demon Market last night, but it was too rushed.

303
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:16,832
I don't actually know what lies within the Demon Market.

304
00:26:20,359 --> 00:26:21,673
What should we do then?

305
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:25,000
I'll stay in Chang'an for the time being

306
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:26,953
to continue investigating the Demon Market,

307
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,393
and then we'll decide.

308
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:33,112
Is Chang'an really this chaotic?

309
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:52,193
Did you encounter anything strange last night?

310
00:26:53,426 --> 00:26:54,426
I did!

311
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:55,520
- What? - What?

312
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,240
Last night,

313
00:26:57,599 --> 00:27:01,233
I don't know if I was drunk or hallucinating,

314
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:04,913
but I clearly saw a crack in my bed.

315
00:27:05,400 --> 00:27:06,720
There was a flash of white light,

316
00:27:07,359 --> 00:27:09,072
and when I opened my eyes again,

317
00:27:10,279 --> 00:27:12,233
my nose was filled with a sweet smell.

318
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,592
It was like I had fallen into a candy shop.

319
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:16,960
You have no idea.

320
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:20,473
Bowls and spoons were clattering around on their own.

321
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,032
Then I turned around and saw a bee that was bigger than a person.

322
00:27:25,160 --> 00:27:26,400
I saw something too last night.

323
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,953
I felt like I'd stumbled into some bizarre place.

324
00:27:29,119 --> 00:27:33,413
There was a tavern, but the shopkeeper wasn't human.

325
00:27:33,720 --> 00:27:34,760
What is it then?

326
00:27:34,839 --> 00:27:37,873
The shopkeeper was a skinny little monkey!

327
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,077
What I saw was even scarier!

328
00:27:40,160 --> 00:27:41,840
There were monsters all over the streets!

329
00:27:59,480 --> 00:28:03,072
What Zhu Ying said is true about the mortal realm.

330
00:28:03,960 --> 00:28:05,673
The barrier cracked last night,

331
00:28:06,119 --> 00:28:09,352
and many mortals claim they dreamt themselves into strange realms,

332
00:28:09,599 --> 00:28:11,032
meeting all kinds of demons.

333
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:13,120
Although the barrier has been repaired now,

334
00:28:13,160 --> 00:28:15,575
and the Demon Market's location won't be exposed for the time being,

335
00:28:15,599 --> 00:28:17,352
rumors are spreading.

336
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,879
Sooner or later, people will start to suspect.

337
00:28:20,359 --> 00:28:22,272
These mortals are forgetful by nature.

338
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:25,512
In the past, even with incidents like this,

339
00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,913
we would just confuse their minds,

340
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,713
and they would forget in a few days.

341
00:28:32,319 --> 00:28:36,072
But this time, why has it blown up so big?

342
00:28:36,599 --> 00:28:39,713
Truth is, the barrier always had flaws,

343
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:41,433
with just one or two small ones.

344
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,592
If we found and fixed them in time, of course they wouldn't notice.

345
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:47,553
But Elder Gray...

346
00:28:50,599 --> 00:28:53,072
If not for that old rat's meddling,

347
00:28:53,359 --> 00:28:55,399
the barrier wouldn't have broken in so many places.

348
00:28:55,480 --> 00:28:58,673
Now everyone is seeing strange things and spreading rumors.

349
00:28:59,119 --> 00:29:00,752
Am I right, Elder White?

350
00:29:04,359 --> 00:29:06,792
Carry on. I'm listening.

351
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:11,239
So after all this, none of you have a solution?

352
00:29:12,640 --> 00:29:15,032
You're usually so quick to criticize Cat Lord.

353
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:18,832
Now that your four sects have caused a huge mess,

354
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,673
why are you all shrinking back?

355
00:29:22,839 --> 00:29:24,312
Lord Shu, please don't be angry.

356
00:29:24,559 --> 00:29:27,877
What Elder Gray did was his own folly.

357
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,837
The three of us have nothing to do with it.

358
00:29:29,920 --> 00:29:31,837
We're not shirking our responsibility,

359
00:29:31,920 --> 00:29:35,797
it's just that this matter is incredibly tricky.

360
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:37,000
That's right.

361
00:29:37,160 --> 00:29:39,673
Cat Lord has always been sharp and insightful,

362
00:29:40,080 --> 00:29:42,633
and Lord Shu is full of wisdom.

363
00:29:42,939 --> 00:29:45,132
You two will surely come up with a solution.

364
00:29:45,480 --> 00:29:49,760
As for us, we'll just listen and do whatever you tell us to.

365
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,960
I, for one, have no head for schemes.

366
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,436
My lord, in my opinion,

367
00:30:00,520 --> 00:30:02,769
if we want to prevent mortals from slipping through the cracks

368
00:30:02,793 --> 00:30:03,832
and causing disaster,

369
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,193
we better be thorough.

370
00:30:06,466 --> 00:30:07,739
What do you mean by thorough?

371
00:30:07,892 --> 00:30:09,252
Too many people, too many tongues.

372
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:13,376
We should deal with the people who appeared near Liu District that night.

373
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:14,893
Silence them?

374
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:16,553
Get rid of them all.

375
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:18,520
What are you talking about?

376
00:30:20,373 --> 00:30:21,645
This is the fastest way.

377
00:30:21,966 --> 00:30:24,352
I have a colorless and odorless demon poison.

378
00:30:24,799 --> 00:30:27,752
We can slip it into the wells, and the mortals will drink it themselves.

379
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:29,176
The authorities would never trace it.

380
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,200
Absurd!

381
00:30:30,400 --> 00:30:33,196
Do you know how many people entered Liu District yesterday?

382
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:34,319
57 people.

383
00:30:34,400 --> 00:30:37,095
And how many businesses and households are there around Liu District?

384
00:30:37,119 --> 00:30:38,159
112.

385
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:39,397
You'd kill them all?

386
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:41,096
The Demon Market has stood for nearly 1,000 years.

387
00:30:41,120 --> 00:30:44,320
If it's exposed, tens of thousands of demons will never know peace again.

388
00:30:45,319 --> 00:30:46,832
I'm thinking of the greater good.

389
00:30:47,000 --> 00:30:48,473
You yourself said

390
00:30:49,920 --> 00:30:51,592
this was Elder Gray's fault.

391
00:30:52,440 --> 00:30:54,400
How can you pass the blame onto innocent mortals?

392
00:30:54,559 --> 00:30:55,896
It's only a couple of hundred people.

393
00:30:55,920 --> 00:30:57,617
That's fewer than the people who died in a coup

394
00:30:57,641 --> 00:30:58,993
staged by their own royalty.

395
00:30:59,480 --> 00:31:01,512
Mortals see their lives as insignificant.

396
00:31:02,400 --> 00:31:04,072
Why should we be bound by rules?

397
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,832
You're a deputy to the Demon Lord.

398
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:09,033
How can you call our demon laws bound by the rules?

399
00:31:09,120 --> 00:31:11,017
The demon law forbids us to slaughter indiscriminately.

400
00:31:11,041 --> 00:31:12,068
I know that.

401
00:31:12,149 --> 00:31:14,199
But can you call killing a couple of hundred people

402
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:15,320
indiscriminate slaughter?

403
00:31:15,401 --> 00:31:17,072
A couple of hundred people?

404
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:19,840
Even killing a single innocent person is indiscriminate slaughter!

405
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:25,879
Zhen.

406
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:28,752
In the Demon Market, address me as Lord.

407
00:31:33,360 --> 00:31:34,360
My Lord,

408
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:37,112
If mortals discover the Demon Market's existence,

409
00:31:37,353 --> 00:31:39,025
it will be beyond control.

410
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:41,846
I'm doing this for the good of the Demon Market.

411
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,157
Lord Shu makes a good point.

412
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:45,240
I also think...

413
00:31:45,320 --> 00:31:47,073
I believe I am still the Cat Lord here.

414
00:31:49,359 --> 00:31:53,276
No matter what, I will never agree to killing thousands of people

415
00:31:53,359 --> 00:31:54,832
because of a "what if".

416
00:31:55,599 --> 00:31:58,473
As the Cat Lord of the Demon Market, I warn everyone here,

417
00:31:59,640 --> 00:32:00,720
no one

418
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:03,597
is to act and kill recklessly.

419
00:32:03,680 --> 00:32:04,713
That is the rule.

420
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,359
Lord Shu.

421
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:11,913
Please remember it well.

422
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:21,760
Yes.

423
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,272
As you command, My Lord.

424
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:27,233
I'll go and recite the demon laws.

425
00:32:36,359 --> 00:32:40,272
Wu Zi Shu's method, though meant to protect the Demon Market,

426
00:32:41,119 --> 00:32:44,393
is too extreme.

427
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:47,352
It could have caused unnecessary trouble.

428
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:50,993
I'll take full responsibility for this matter and see it resolved.

429
00:32:51,440 --> 00:32:52,520
You are all dismissed.

430
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:14,193
Are you really mad at Wu Zi Shu?

431
00:33:17,640 --> 00:33:19,352
That's just his temper.

432
00:33:21,160 --> 00:33:25,032
He's always a bit sharp with everyone but you.

433
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,993
I always thought I knew him well,

434
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:30,913
but I never realized

435
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,439
how lightly he regards human life.

436
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,233
And in human eyes,

437
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,359
aren't our demon lives just as cheap?

438
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,234
200 years ago,

439
00:33:51,055 --> 00:33:53,847
(I walked the mortal world as the White Serpent.)

440
00:33:54,791 --> 00:33:56,064
(That's when I met Duan.)

441
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,753
(We knew each other through writing.)

442
00:34:12,360 --> 00:34:15,953
(He wrote case judgments, while I wrote strange tales about monsters.)

443
00:34:16,773 --> 00:34:18,527
(We were a perfect match.)

444
00:34:34,960 --> 00:34:38,353
(He said he loved me, and I believed him.)

445
00:34:39,559 --> 00:34:41,993
(He said he could accept all my strengths and flaws, )

446
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,313
(and I believed that too.)

447
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:48,873
(He said he'd stay with me for life, never abandon me, )

448
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,592
(and I still believed it.)

449
00:34:57,239 --> 00:34:58,359
And then?

450
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,079
Then...

451
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:23,672
(He accidentally discovered my demon body.)

452
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:25,793
(He fled in terror.)

453
00:35:26,559 --> 00:35:28,473
- It's a demon! - Duan!

454
00:35:30,199 --> 00:35:31,273
A demon!

455
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:45,072
(I thought I would never see him again.)

456
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:48,393
(But to my surprise, he came back)

457
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,753
(and said he wanted to get back together.)

458
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,714
Bai, let's get married.

459
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,120
Duan,

460
00:36:21,814 --> 00:36:23,320
what did you put in the wine?

461
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:29,632
You drugged the wine.

462
00:36:33,519 --> 00:36:34,559
Marriage?

463
00:36:35,159 --> 00:36:36,799
Do you really think of yourself as human?

464
00:36:37,519 --> 00:36:38,519
Go to hell!

465
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,993
(I'll never forget the look on his face.)

466
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:51,913
His teeth were bared, and his face was twisted with hatred.

467
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:55,712
That gentleman

468
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:00,353
was so shameless.

469
00:37:03,880 --> 00:37:05,592
You never talk about your past.

470
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:07,472
Why are you telling me this today?

471
00:37:09,000 --> 00:37:12,633
I'm not telling you this because I'm sad.

472
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:15,112
I want you to know,

473
00:37:18,719 --> 00:37:19,799
Kitty,

474
00:37:21,160 --> 00:37:24,553
don't imagine you can see through everyone around you.

475
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:29,232
There are two sides to everything.

476
00:37:30,575 --> 00:37:35,200
The closer you get, the sharper the hidden edge becomes.
