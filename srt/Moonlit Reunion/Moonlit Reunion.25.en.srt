00:01:27,247 --> 00:01:31,040
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,137 --> 00:01:34,080
(Episode 25)

3
00:01:39,184 --> 00:01:41,942
- Why are you dragging me?   - Where are you even going?

4
00:01:42,037 --> 00:01:44,840
- I have to go home.   - Why would you go home?

5
00:01:45,109 --> 00:01:46,920
This is a brothel?

6
00:01:47,310 --> 00:01:49,320
A place of indulgence and desire.

7
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:52,600
For that Dream Demon, it's practically irresistible.

8
00:01:59,519 --> 00:02:02,604
(Ruyi Pavilion)

9
00:02:03,860 --> 00:02:04,923
He's here.

10
00:02:12,975 --> 00:02:16,880
My Lord. I don't understand, why does it have to be me helping with this?

11
00:02:18,901 --> 00:02:21,076
That Dream Demon is mischievous by nature.

12
00:02:21,220 --> 00:02:24,035
Peeking and toying with others is like a hobby to him.

13
00:02:25,396 --> 00:02:29,691
The weirder and wilder the dream, the more he enjoys it.

14
00:02:30,230 --> 00:02:33,302
Now that he's been feeding off the essence in people's dreams,

15
00:02:33,463 --> 00:02:35,069
he's getting stronger and pickier.

16
00:02:35,150 --> 00:02:36,520
I figured

17
00:02:37,109 --> 00:02:38,926
only your dreams would satisfy him.

18
00:02:39,812 --> 00:02:41,280
My dream?

19
00:02:42,413 --> 00:02:43,960
Why?

20
00:02:44,262 --> 00:02:46,000
Mei Si is a human.

21
00:02:47,062 --> 00:02:48,920
I'm a half-human.

22
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,680
But you're different.

23
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,960
You're Chang'an's most charming,

24
00:02:56,813 --> 00:02:58,790
most mysterious,

25
00:02:59,256 --> 00:03:01,393
most admired,

26
00:03:01,626 --> 00:03:04,063
and most adored great demon.

27
00:03:05,551 --> 00:03:07,000
Me?

28
00:03:07,734 --> 00:03:08,797
Of course.

29
00:03:09,053 --> 00:03:11,267
You've crossed more bridges than I've walked roads.

30
00:03:11,348 --> 00:03:13,840
You've loved more people than I've shed fur.

31
00:03:13,974 --> 00:03:16,951
Your life's worth more than eight of our lives put together.

32
00:03:17,135 --> 00:03:20,846
Your desires, your secrets, your dreams...

33
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:23,840
I can't even begin to imagine how dazzling they are.

34
00:03:24,731 --> 00:03:28,411
No demon with a normal mind would miss out on you.

35
00:03:28,534 --> 00:03:29,920
Let's do it.

36
00:03:32,446 --> 00:03:35,080
My Lord, if you're planning to use me as bait, just say so.

37
00:03:35,614 --> 00:03:37,400
- After all, I am...   - Let's get started.

38
00:03:45,430 --> 00:03:46,920
To be honest,

39
00:03:47,134 --> 00:03:49,920
with you two staring at me like this, I'm feeling a lot of pressure.

40
00:03:50,447 --> 00:03:52,160
I can't even fall asleep.

41
00:03:52,790 --> 00:03:54,160
Can't fall asleep?

42
00:03:54,956 --> 00:03:56,400
But you're sleeping anyway.

43
00:04:15,184 --> 00:04:16,400
Here it comes.

44
00:04:17,117 --> 00:04:18,400
It's true.

45
00:04:22,750 --> 00:04:24,080
Isn't that

46
00:04:24,830 --> 00:04:25,893
Ruyi Pavilion?

47
00:04:28,079 --> 00:04:29,960
Is Lady Hu Zhu in danger?

48
00:04:47,238 --> 00:04:49,360
Who's tugging on me? So rude!

49
00:04:57,846 --> 00:04:59,301
So this is what you look like.

50
00:05:01,741 --> 00:05:02,804
Cute.

51
00:05:03,014 --> 00:05:05,160
What do you want?

52
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,806
You've been inside my dream.

53
00:05:06,949 --> 00:05:08,764
You should know that I'm a cat demon.

54
00:05:09,070 --> 00:05:11,365
And cats love fish.

55
00:05:12,214 --> 00:05:17,860
Especially a fattened-up little demon like you.

56
00:05:18,038 --> 00:05:21,880
Wait, I'm just a minor character.

57
00:05:21,982 --> 00:05:23,261
I'm full of curiosity, that's all.

58
00:05:23,381 --> 00:05:27,421
Besides, even if you eat me, I won't boost your power much.

59
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:28,910
Then I'll just eat half of it.

60
00:05:29,056 --> 00:05:30,480
See how you taste.

61
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,920
I'll then leave you half-dead,

62
00:05:33,204 --> 00:05:35,101
flopping around,

63
00:05:35,789 --> 00:05:37,760
unable to swim ever again.

64
00:05:37,886 --> 00:05:39,382
Please don't scare me like that.

65
00:05:39,463 --> 00:05:42,560
I can live without many things, but not without freedom.

66
00:05:43,190 --> 00:05:47,726
I became a demon to wander the mortal world

67
00:05:48,110 --> 00:05:50,200
and taste all the mortals' desires.

68
00:05:50,869 --> 00:05:52,240
In mortals' dreams,

69
00:05:52,790 --> 00:05:55,800
I free mortals from repression and constrain,

70
00:05:56,310 --> 00:05:58,560
and give them a moment of relief.

71
00:05:59,150 --> 00:06:00,951
Isn't that mutual benefit?

72
00:06:01,087 --> 00:06:02,237
Isn't that pretty good?

73
00:06:02,484 --> 00:06:04,031
Why are you targeting me?

74
00:06:04,349 --> 00:06:06,840
Freedom in dreams isn't real freedom.

75
00:06:07,141 --> 00:06:10,240
Once they wake up, they still have to deal with the mess.

76
00:06:10,404 --> 00:06:11,619
That's easy.

77
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:13,230
Just don't let them wake up.

78
00:06:13,345 --> 00:06:15,451
Keep them dreaming forever.

79
00:06:17,230 --> 00:06:19,926
You're dreaming the impossible.

80
00:06:22,013 --> 00:06:24,670
You've disturbed mortal minds,

81
00:06:24,806 --> 00:06:26,542
stirred up chaos in the mortal realm.

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,240
As the Cat Lord,

83
00:06:28,463 --> 00:06:30,462
I'm taking you back to Demon City for punishment.

84
00:06:30,613 --> 00:06:33,070
I won't play nice. What can you do?

85
00:06:36,413 --> 00:06:37,840
Haven't you noticed?

86
00:06:38,253 --> 00:06:39,670
You're already in a dream.

87
00:06:49,430 --> 00:06:51,080
This isn't Ling Xiao's dream.

88
00:06:51,335 --> 00:06:52,655
I just saw his dream.

89
00:06:52,781 --> 00:06:54,837
It was boring to death. Not worth watching.

90
00:06:55,070 --> 00:06:57,927
You're in my dream now.

91
00:06:58,355 --> 00:06:59,475
Your dream?

92
00:06:59,580 --> 00:07:01,581
The dream of a Dream Demon. A dream within a dream.

93
00:07:01,750 --> 00:07:03,909
A dream that contains all, absorbs all.

94
00:07:03,989 --> 00:07:06,035
A dream ruled by me, a dream where I alone decide.

95
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:15,760
(Ruyi Pavilion)

96
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:18,080
You stay outside and cover me.

97
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:24,164
No way.

98
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,440
Since it's a dream,

99
00:07:26,413 --> 00:07:28,800
maybe I can use Ling Xiao's flower branch to fight back.

100
00:07:44,942 --> 00:07:46,040
That's impossible!

101
00:07:46,142 --> 00:07:48,320
How can this flower branch break through my dream?

102
00:07:52,389 --> 00:07:53,760
Cat Demon.

103
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:07,806
What's going on?

104
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,606
Where is Lady Hu Zhu?

105
00:08:12,510 --> 00:08:14,246
What's the matter? Why are you so tense?

106
00:08:15,669 --> 00:08:17,086
Nothing.

107
00:08:17,150 --> 00:08:19,966
You were taking too long, so I just rested here.

108
00:08:20,956 --> 00:08:22,572
Zhu Yu, where's the demon?

109
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,213
It escaped.

110
00:08:25,389 --> 00:08:26,468
Escaped?

111
00:08:26,549 --> 00:08:28,405
But that's good.

112
00:08:29,030 --> 00:08:30,093
What do you mean?

113
00:08:30,390 --> 00:08:31,606
I was never planning to catch him.

114
00:08:32,390 --> 00:08:33,725
I just want to follow his trail.

115
00:08:34,590 --> 00:08:36,287
Let's go, while the magic's still strong.

116
00:08:37,388 --> 00:08:38,549
Where are we going?

117
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:39,693
To Demon City.

118
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:41,853
Demon City?

119
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:45,167
Boss, it's time to wake up.

120
00:08:57,550 --> 00:08:59,165
I've brought you back to Demon City.

121
00:08:59,590 --> 00:09:02,605
Without my permission, you're not allowed to leave.

122
00:09:03,918 --> 00:09:05,039
I didn't do anything wrong.

123
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:06,685
Why are you arresting me?

124
00:09:07,270 --> 00:09:09,046
You invaded people's dreams.

125
00:09:09,150 --> 00:09:10,326
Isn't that wrong enough?

126
00:09:11,550 --> 00:09:14,927
I enter their dreams to help them break free,

127
00:09:15,182 --> 00:09:18,606
act on their true desires, make up for regrets, and fulfill their wishes.

128
00:09:19,449 --> 00:09:20,786
Shouldn't they be happy?

129
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:23,926
Whether they're happy or not is their choice.

130
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:27,086
Who are you to decide for them?

131
00:09:27,829 --> 00:09:28,829
Why are you doing this?

132
00:09:28,922 --> 00:09:31,099
I... Why?

133
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:32,645
Because it's fun.

134
00:09:33,350 --> 00:09:36,166
You probably don't know that dreams have flavors.

135
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:38,366
Some dreams are sweet,

136
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,173
like honey,

137
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:44,290
acing the imperial exams, getting married, and having a happy family.

138
00:09:46,789 --> 00:09:49,605
Some dreams are sour,

139
00:09:49,870 --> 00:09:52,166
like jealousy, scheming and greed.

140
00:09:53,478 --> 00:09:54,935
And some...

141
00:09:56,359 --> 00:09:59,296
Some are bitter and harsh,

142
00:10:00,709 --> 00:10:06,349
like those hiding secrets they cannot ever speak aloud.

143
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,526
You throw mortal lives into chaos just for your own amusement.

144
00:10:14,629 --> 00:10:15,669
Ridiculous.

145
00:10:15,750 --> 00:10:16,966
That's not true.

146
00:10:17,047 --> 00:10:18,863
I'm helping them.

147
00:10:20,190 --> 00:10:22,366
Humans are the most hypocritical creatures.

148
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:26,446
They want things but they don't dare to admit it.

149
00:10:26,590 --> 00:10:31,526
I enter their dreams to let them enjoy their true desires

150
00:10:31,963 --> 00:10:34,819
and do what they really want but are too scared to do.

151
00:10:36,390 --> 00:10:37,645
True desires?

152
00:10:42,950 --> 00:10:45,486
Just now, I slipped into your dream.

153
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,553
I saw that

154
00:10:49,230 --> 00:10:50,725
you want to become a full demon

155
00:10:51,397 --> 00:10:53,532
and be with that handsome man...

156
00:10:57,990 --> 00:10:59,390
Fine! I won't say it out then!

157
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:01,030
Why did you suddenly attack me?

158
00:11:01,110 --> 00:11:02,645
Put me down!

159
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,510
Seriously, have you been pretending to be human for too long?

160
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:12,349
All this hiding and pretending are so boring.

161
00:11:12,429 --> 00:11:14,686
Why not admit what you really want?

162
00:11:15,949 --> 00:11:17,670
What? Do you still want to enter dreams?

163
00:11:17,750 --> 00:11:19,150
No, I wouldn't dare.

164
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:20,485
Don't be afraid.

165
00:11:21,036 --> 00:11:24,531
I'd like to hear what kind of dream my boss has.

166
00:11:24,789 --> 00:11:25,949
You want to know?

167
00:11:26,030 --> 00:11:27,093
I'll tell you

168
00:11:27,910 --> 00:11:28,973
next time.

169
00:11:32,336 --> 00:11:37,166
You enjoy prying into others' lives and telling them what to do.

170
00:11:37,670 --> 00:11:39,486
It's because you're uneducated.

171
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:42,805
Starting tomorrow, you'll be attending Demon Academy.

172
00:11:44,349 --> 00:11:45,412
Demon Academy?

173
00:11:46,230 --> 00:11:50,247
Don't tell me demons here actually go to an academy?

174
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:52,605
Studying is not just for humans.

175
00:11:52,870 --> 00:11:53,933
I don't want it!

176
00:11:54,470 --> 00:11:56,366
I'd rather be thrown into Demon Prison.

177
00:11:57,470 --> 00:11:58,846
That's not up to you.

178
00:11:59,995 --> 00:12:01,058
Get back here!

179
00:12:02,136 --> 00:12:03,175
I don't want it!

180
00:12:03,589 --> 00:12:05,125
I don't want to study.

181
00:12:05,190 --> 00:12:07,046
I really don't want to study.

182
00:12:12,221 --> 00:12:13,284
So

183
00:12:13,510 --> 00:12:16,047
you let that Dream Demon escape on purpose?

184
00:12:16,462 --> 00:12:17,638
He's just a little demon.

185
00:12:17,949 --> 00:12:19,526
Even if we caught him, it wouldn't change much.

186
00:12:20,309 --> 00:12:22,645
Better to let him go and follow the trail to something bigger.

187
00:12:23,230 --> 00:12:25,485
And? Did you catch anything?

188
00:12:29,862 --> 00:12:32,926
The spell energy is definitely concentrated here.

189
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,046
No wonder we couldn't find Demon City.

190
00:13:02,390 --> 00:13:04,927
Because Demon City is not hidden in any one corner of Chang'an.

191
00:13:10,622 --> 00:13:11,959
The entire city of Chang'an

192
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:15,646
is Demon City.

193
00:13:18,750 --> 00:13:20,125
Demon City is simply

194
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,685
another Chang'an.

195
00:13:46,310 --> 00:13:49,350
Sect Leader Chang Ming, after all the help I've given you,

196
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:53,270
don't let it go to waste.

197
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:14,813
Who bit me?

198
00:14:18,502 --> 00:14:19,565
Where is this place?

199
00:14:20,110 --> 00:14:21,173
How did I end up here?

200
00:14:48,721 --> 00:14:51,612
With demons running wild,

201
00:14:51,710 --> 00:14:54,106
this is the perfect time for Changxi Palace to descend the mountain.

202
00:14:59,950 --> 00:15:01,013
What's wrong?

203
00:15:01,310 --> 00:15:02,589
Nothing.

204
00:15:02,670 --> 00:15:03,750
What is it really?

205
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:08,685
Zhu Yu, you're kind of scaring me right now.

206
00:15:10,516 --> 00:15:12,877
It's nothing serious.

207
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:16,206
I just wanted to ask what our next move is.

208
00:15:17,870 --> 00:15:19,526
We may have found where Demon City lies,

209
00:15:19,957 --> 00:15:21,557
but we still don't know how to get in.

210
00:15:22,775 --> 00:15:26,032
But since those two demons vanished near that ruined temple,

211
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:28,366
I bet something is hidden there.

212
00:15:29,390 --> 00:15:33,711
You mean we should tear the temple down and take a closer look?

213
00:15:36,110 --> 00:15:37,910
The situation inside Demon City is unpredictable.

214
00:15:37,991 --> 00:15:39,110
It's just the two of us.

215
00:15:39,191 --> 00:15:40,647
We need a solid plan first.

216
00:15:41,056 --> 00:15:42,616
You're right.

217
00:15:43,323 --> 00:15:44,683
You have a point.

218
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:48,766
One day, I'll cleanse this chaotic place completely.

219
00:15:49,990 --> 00:15:51,053
Chang'an

220
00:15:52,829 --> 00:15:54,686
will be a brighter and safer city.

221
00:15:55,990 --> 00:15:57,053
And what happened today

222
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,806
will never happen to her again.

223
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:11,360
(Ruyi Pavilion)

224
00:16:21,151 --> 00:16:22,191
How did it go?

225
00:16:22,519 --> 00:16:25,029
I felt like your boss vanished right after I fell asleep.

226
00:16:25,110 --> 00:16:26,173
Lower your voice.

227
00:16:28,870 --> 00:16:29,910
We got him.

228
00:16:30,230 --> 00:16:31,293
Got him?

229
00:16:32,230 --> 00:16:34,605
My boss trapped the Dream Demon inside a dream.

230
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:38,046
That must have been thrilling.

231
00:16:38,709 --> 00:16:39,925
But it's all handled now.

232
00:16:40,030 --> 00:16:41,093
You can head back.

233
00:16:49,229 --> 00:16:52,621
Master Shuang Jiang, when did you return to Chang'an?

234
00:16:52,750 --> 00:16:54,967
I just arrived.

235
00:16:55,350 --> 00:16:56,526
Are you alone?

236
00:16:57,816 --> 00:17:01,032
Do you want me to find you a couple of girls to sing for you?

237
00:17:01,110 --> 00:17:02,487
No need.

238
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:06,325
I came to speak with you, Lady Hu Zhu.

239
00:17:08,950 --> 00:17:11,749
You once helped me, and I owe you a great debt.

240
00:17:11,910 --> 00:17:13,446
I should repay you for your kindness.

241
00:17:14,230 --> 00:17:16,326
But I am a cultivator.

242
00:17:16,510 --> 00:17:21,190
Although I'm not a great cultivator, I am devoted to the Path.

243
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:22,725
There are some things I shouldn't do.

244
00:17:23,110 --> 00:17:27,406
But now, because of you, I have made some serious mistakes.

245
00:17:27,790 --> 00:17:28,853
Wait!

246
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:33,806
Your expression...

247
00:17:34,270 --> 00:17:36,166
Are you going to give yourself to me to repay the favor?

248
00:17:36,950 --> 00:17:39,086
- I...   - If that's the case, you don't need to repay me.

249
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:43,086
You're dedicated to cultivation, and I am dedicated to making money.

250
00:17:43,710 --> 00:17:45,806
We can stay out of each other's way.

251
00:17:46,830 --> 00:17:48,190
That's not what I meant.

252
00:17:48,670 --> 00:17:49,733
What do you mean then?

253
00:17:53,050 --> 00:17:54,306
Actually,

254
00:17:56,888 --> 00:17:58,918
I know your identity, Lady Hu Zhu.

255
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:02,046
So I want to persuade you to turn over a new leaf.

256
00:18:02,190 --> 00:18:03,630
I can help you ascend to a better path.

257
00:18:05,775 --> 00:18:06,838
Ascend?

258
00:18:08,869 --> 00:18:10,749
I'm running a proper business.

259
00:18:10,829 --> 00:18:12,086
You want to buy me back?

260
00:18:13,910 --> 00:18:15,246
What do you take me for?

261
00:18:15,389 --> 00:18:16,885
This is a waste of my money-making time!

262
00:18:28,149 --> 00:18:29,685
Was I mistaken?

263
00:18:31,149 --> 00:18:32,326
That can't be right.

264
00:18:43,190 --> 00:18:44,566
Young Master, you're finally back!

265
00:18:45,070 --> 00:18:46,110
What's wrong?

266
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:47,254
You're asking me?

267
00:18:47,556 --> 00:18:49,636
On your wedding day, you disappeared for half the day,

268
00:18:50,076 --> 00:18:51,956
leaving me here alone in this mess.

269
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,990
How could I not get scolded by the Princess's attendants?

270
00:18:55,430 --> 00:18:56,493
Did Madam scold you?

271
00:18:58,070 --> 00:18:59,133
She didn't.

272
00:18:59,829 --> 00:19:02,086
It was Lady Ming Zhuang, the Princess's attendant.

273
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:03,766
She scolded me terribly.

274
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,842
I'll go check on my wife.

275
00:19:07,270 --> 00:19:08,333
Young Master!

276
00:19:08,750 --> 00:19:09,790
Young Master!

277
00:19:09,871 --> 00:19:12,046
I haven't even told you half the grievances I suffered!

278
00:19:12,910 --> 00:19:13,973
Young Master!

279
00:19:27,230 --> 00:19:28,845
Madam, are you asleep?

280
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:47,293
Lady Ming Zhuang.

281
00:19:47,510 --> 00:19:48,573
Mr. Mei.

282
00:19:48,750 --> 00:19:51,671
On your wedding day, you abandoned your bride and vanished for half a day.

283
00:19:51,752 --> 00:19:52,886
How do you explain yourself?

284
00:19:52,967 --> 00:19:54,967
What could possibly be more important than your wedding?

285
00:19:55,142 --> 00:19:56,359
I was wrong.

286
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,246
But first, can you tell me where my wife is?

287
00:20:01,030 --> 00:20:02,927
Isn't Lady Wu in her room?

288
00:20:03,790 --> 00:20:05,710
Lady Wu Zhen said she was tired and wanted to take a nap.

289
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,645
She told us not to wait on her outside the door.

290
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:09,870
I thought she hadn't woken up yet

291
00:20:09,950 --> 00:20:11,950
and was just about to wake her to freshen herself up.

292
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:26,160
(My head hurts so much because of that ugly monster.)

293
00:20:44,390 --> 00:20:45,453
Oh no.

294
00:21:02,990 --> 00:21:05,445
Mr. Mei, Lady Wu Zhen is really gone.

295
00:21:05,590 --> 00:21:06,807
Where do you think she went?

296
00:21:07,950 --> 00:21:09,726
Lady Ming Zhuang, wait here.

297
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:11,333
I'll check the Ruyi Pavilion.

298
00:21:14,270 --> 00:21:15,333
Zhu Yu?

299
00:21:21,263 --> 00:21:22,326
Wu Zhen?

300
00:21:23,390 --> 00:21:24,807
You've been here all along?

301
00:21:25,630 --> 00:21:26,805
Of course.

302
00:21:32,870 --> 00:21:33,933
Sorry.

303
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:41,167
Zhu Yu, are you shy?

304
00:22:37,870 --> 00:22:39,245
Why is your face red?

305
00:22:41,150 --> 00:22:42,213
You're doing this on purpose.

306
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:45,326
Yes. On purpose.

307
00:22:50,356 --> 00:22:51,419
Forgive me.

308
00:22:51,950 --> 00:22:55,285
I almost let something bad happen to you on our wedding day.

309
00:22:57,430 --> 00:22:59,726
I was sleepwalking. How could that be your fault?

310
00:23:01,829 --> 00:23:03,365
But I can't lose you again.

311
00:23:08,190 --> 00:23:09,766
You won't lose me.

312
00:23:11,590 --> 00:23:13,085
I'll never leave you.

313
00:23:14,430 --> 00:23:15,493
Really?

314
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:22,405
And I will never allow anyone or anything

315
00:23:23,790 --> 00:23:24,950
to harm you again.

316
00:25:34,870 --> 00:25:36,045
Was I really mistaken?

317
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:38,726
Should I tell Brother Mei?

318
00:25:40,249 --> 00:25:42,025
I'm so torn.

319
00:25:42,230 --> 00:25:43,606
It's making me lose my appetite.

320
00:25:47,990 --> 00:25:49,390
Don't you see someone is sitting here?

321
00:25:51,390 --> 00:25:54,325
Second Brother?

322
00:25:54,870 --> 00:25:55,933
What filling is it?

323
00:26:07,069 --> 00:26:09,229
This is outrageous.

324
00:26:09,910 --> 00:26:12,166
Normally it's the bride visiting her family after the wedding.

325
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:15,167
But here I am, the father-in-law is forced to come instead.

326
00:26:15,950 --> 00:26:18,110
I have to come to see them, fine.

327
00:26:18,216 --> 00:26:19,257
But what time is it now?

328
00:26:19,350 --> 00:26:20,469
It's already noon.

329
00:26:20,550 --> 00:26:22,750
I still haven't seen either of them!

330
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,790
Isn't that a good sign?

331
00:26:24,910 --> 00:26:27,070
Your Grace will be a grandfather soon.

332
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,606
You should be happy.

333
00:26:28,790 --> 00:26:30,085
I can't be happy.

334
00:26:39,082 --> 00:26:41,179
You two are finally out of your room.

335
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:47,966
I know you're newlywed and young, but

336
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,298
you have to have some restraint.

337
00:26:52,470 --> 00:26:56,125
Some things should be done in moderation.

338
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:00,925
You don't need to worry about the business of us young people.

339
00:27:02,102 --> 00:27:03,165
I...

340
00:27:03,670 --> 00:27:06,726
I'm just worried about your body.

341
00:27:11,349 --> 00:27:13,286
See? What did I tell you?

342
00:27:13,722 --> 00:27:16,362
Moderation!

343
00:27:16,430 --> 00:27:17,493
Are you okay?

344
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:22,006
I'm just a little dizzy from hunger.

345
00:27:22,622 --> 00:27:23,685
Fine.

346
00:27:31,750 --> 00:27:33,925
Young Master, here's a letter for you.

347
00:27:41,710 --> 00:27:43,630
If it's something urgent, you should go take care of it.

348
00:27:43,750 --> 00:27:46,086
It's okay. It's nothing urgent.

349
00:28:06,150 --> 00:28:07,213
It's good.

350
00:28:08,575 --> 00:28:09,638
It's good.

351
00:28:27,310 --> 00:28:29,872
Chang Ming, we're staying here?

352
00:28:30,790 --> 00:28:32,566
Isn't it a bit too humble?

353
00:28:35,510 --> 00:28:38,310
When Heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on man,

354
00:28:38,389 --> 00:28:40,789
it must first test his will and exhaust his body.

355
00:28:40,869 --> 00:28:42,486
You must endure.

356
00:28:42,630 --> 00:28:45,149
After all, Chang'an is under the watchful eye of Demon City.

357
00:28:45,230 --> 00:28:47,510
Don't be too conspicuous or you'll attract unwanted attention.

358
00:28:49,889 --> 00:28:52,232
We are demon slayers and they are demons.

359
00:28:52,390 --> 00:28:54,845
Since when does a cat run from a mouse?

360
00:29:01,430 --> 00:29:03,670
Demon City is powerful and difficult to deal with right now.

361
00:29:03,789 --> 00:29:06,405
It's best to be cautious in all matters.

362
00:29:07,283 --> 00:29:09,058
Don't worry, Chang Ming.

363
00:29:09,389 --> 00:29:10,830
They don't know what we look like.

364
00:29:10,910 --> 00:29:12,605
They won't suspect a thing.

365
00:29:16,230 --> 00:29:20,046
Your eyes are blind now, and your evil magic has dissipated.

366
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,806
Get out of here.

367
00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:24,086
Don't ever come back.

368
00:29:24,769 --> 00:29:25,832
No!

369
00:29:27,149 --> 00:29:28,246
Sect Leader Chang Ming.

370
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:33,806
If it weren't for that traitor speaking in defense of Demon City

371
00:29:34,943 --> 00:29:37,470
and swaying the others, we'd have descended the mountain long ago.

372
00:29:37,549 --> 00:29:39,309
Why did we have to waste all this time for nothing

373
00:29:39,389 --> 00:29:40,605
and only have a few of us come?

374
00:29:40,990 --> 00:29:44,285
If you ask me, the punishment on him was far too light.

375
00:29:49,910 --> 00:29:52,445
Be that as it may, we're in Chang'an now.

376
00:29:52,615 --> 00:29:53,712
We have achieved our goal.

377
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:58,150
Fortunately, news of the Dream Demon

378
00:29:58,230 --> 00:30:00,150
has spread through Chang'an like wildfire.

379
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:03,086
Clearly Heaven stands with you, Chang Ming.

380
00:30:04,392 --> 00:30:06,240
(I hope it works.)

381
00:30:06,430 --> 00:30:09,286
(I wouldn't want my efforts to bring you here to be in vain.)

382
00:30:10,149 --> 00:30:14,086
But I don't understand why you sent Chi Hua to find Mei Zhu Yu.

383
00:30:15,869 --> 00:30:18,205
If it weren't for Shuang Jiang letting it slip,

384
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,526
I wouldn't have known that Mei Zhu Yu found the location of Demon City.

385
00:30:23,349 --> 00:30:27,445
It seems that attacking Chang'an will be difficult without him.

386
00:30:30,596 --> 00:30:32,331
Besides, my Changxi Truncheon...

387
00:30:32,589 --> 00:30:35,165
Didn't you already reclaim the Changxi Truncheon?

388
00:30:37,310 --> 00:30:41,605
I have the Changxi Truncheon again, but I haven't been able to summon it.

389
00:30:41,750 --> 00:30:44,045
What? What is going on?

390
00:30:48,389 --> 00:30:49,452
I don't know either.

391
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,445
Maybe he did something to it.

392
00:30:56,442 --> 00:30:57,505
But, Lian Fu,

393
00:30:58,470 --> 00:31:00,325
you must not let anyone else know about this.

394
00:31:02,510 --> 00:31:03,789
The most important thing right now

395
00:31:03,869 --> 00:31:05,949
is for our Changxi Palace to establish a foothold in Chang'an.

396
00:31:06,109 --> 00:31:08,046
We can't let anything shake morale.

397
00:31:08,910 --> 00:31:09,973
We will

398
00:31:12,549 --> 00:31:13,726
talk about this later.

399
00:31:15,829 --> 00:31:16,892
Sure.

400
00:31:20,544 --> 00:31:21,681
(Mei Zhu Yu?)

401
00:31:22,226 --> 00:31:23,680
(How could it be him?)

402
00:31:46,270 --> 00:31:49,773
I never thought we would meet again in Chang'an.

403
00:31:50,202 --> 00:31:51,763
We already heard about the Dream Demon.

404
00:31:52,030 --> 00:31:54,326
And with Shuang Jiang keeping in contact with us on the mountain,

405
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,309
we learned you'd found Demon City.

406
00:31:56,389 --> 00:31:58,205
So the Sect Leader pressed us to descend quickly.

407
00:31:58,309 --> 00:32:00,925
Had it not been for the urgency, there would've been far more of us.

408
00:32:01,750 --> 00:32:03,447
So your mission is...

409
00:32:03,528 --> 00:32:04,665
The Sect Leader believes that

410
00:32:04,750 --> 00:32:06,205
since we know where Demon City is now,

411
00:32:06,270 --> 00:32:08,111
if we can find a way to open Demon City,

412
00:32:08,390 --> 00:32:10,070
we can attack it in one fell swoop,

413
00:32:10,150 --> 00:32:12,045
exterminate the demons, and protect the people.

414
00:32:15,443 --> 00:32:16,506
What's the matter?

415
00:32:16,836 --> 00:32:17,932
Do you have a different opinion?

416
00:32:19,750 --> 00:32:24,365
It's my wish to eradicate Demon City and bring peace to Chang'an,

417
00:32:24,470 --> 00:32:26,246
not to mention the revenge for my parents.

418
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:29,966
But we know nothing of the demons inside Demon City.

419
00:32:30,047 --> 00:32:33,863
I fear if we break the barrier recklessly, it will only backfire.

420
00:32:35,190 --> 00:32:37,868
The Sect Leader wants to settle this quickly

421
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:39,516
and get rid of Demon City as soon as possible.

422
00:32:39,549 --> 00:32:41,885
I'm afraid this decision will not change.

423
00:32:42,950 --> 00:32:44,407
Since the Sect Leader has already decided,

424
00:32:44,942 --> 00:32:46,198
why are you here looking for me?

425
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:48,830
Although you are no longer a member of the Changxi Palace,

426
00:32:48,910 --> 00:32:50,205
our goals are the same.

427
00:32:50,430 --> 00:32:54,405
If we work together, Demon City will definitely not be able to escape.

428
00:32:56,150 --> 00:32:57,565
So you want me to cooperate with you.

429
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,766
After all, we are new to Chang'an and will need your help.

430
00:33:02,310 --> 00:33:03,926
And as for where those demons vanished,

431
00:33:03,990 --> 00:33:05,686
you surely know the area better than we do.

432
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:13,870
I know we were a little cold to you when you were being punished.

433
00:33:13,950 --> 00:33:15,013
I don't blame you.

434
00:33:15,790 --> 00:33:16,853
I don't care.

435
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:20,686
I can help with this,

436
00:33:21,590 --> 00:33:24,125
but I've carried this grudge against Demon City for 18 years.

437
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:27,725
I can wait, but I cannot fail.

438
00:33:28,830 --> 00:33:29,893
I only wish that

439
00:33:31,670 --> 00:33:34,967
when we strike, we completely eliminate Demon City.

440
00:33:38,888 --> 00:33:39,951
Boss.

441
00:33:41,310 --> 00:33:42,487
Take your medicine.

442
00:33:45,830 --> 00:33:47,525
Drink the medicine first.

443
00:33:47,910 --> 00:33:49,725
Mother Sow brew this medicine

444
00:33:49,950 --> 00:33:52,110
with a century-old lingzhi mushroom based on your symptoms.

445
00:33:52,350 --> 00:33:53,725
It stinks.

446
00:33:54,149 --> 00:33:56,925
It smells bad, but it's very nourishing.

447
00:33:57,510 --> 00:33:59,125
A lot of things have happened recently.

448
00:33:59,629 --> 00:34:01,365
You have to take good care of your body.

449
00:34:02,550 --> 00:34:05,287
This is really hard to swallow.

450
00:34:06,150 --> 00:34:09,246
In Demon City, Mother Sow is the second-best at medicine.

451
00:34:09,990 --> 00:34:13,086
If you don't like it, shall we go to Wu Zi Shu?

452
00:34:25,510 --> 00:34:26,573
Alright.

453
00:34:26,763 --> 00:34:27,922
I've finished the medicine.

454
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,086
I should go back.

455
00:34:29,430 --> 00:34:32,989
I came here by lying that I was out shopping with Lady Liu.

456
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:34,150
I can't stay here too long.

457
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:36,205
Why are you in such a hurry to leave?

458
00:34:36,790 --> 00:34:38,749
Your husband is broad-minded.

459
00:34:39,069 --> 00:34:41,325
He wouldn't mind you coming to Ruyi Pavilion for some fun, right?

460
00:34:42,430 --> 00:34:44,325
My husband is so handsome.

461
00:34:44,709 --> 00:34:46,366
Why would I go out and look at other men?

462
00:34:50,180 --> 00:34:53,480
(Ruyi Pavilion)

463
00:34:57,750 --> 00:34:58,813
Serpent Lord.

464
00:34:59,789 --> 00:35:00,852
Where is she?

465
00:35:01,470 --> 00:35:02,533
She already left.

466
00:35:14,048 --> 00:35:15,305
(This is Zhen's medicine.)

467
00:35:23,910 --> 00:35:26,605
Did you buy anything while you were out with Lady Liu today?

468
00:35:27,176 --> 00:35:28,272
Didn't buy anything.

469
00:35:29,870 --> 00:35:31,127
You don't have to save money for me.

470
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:34,125
I'm not saving money.

471
00:35:39,069 --> 00:35:41,846
I believe my husband has the ability to earn money.

472
00:35:56,149 --> 00:35:57,805
That's not right, Young Master Sun.

473
00:35:57,983 --> 00:36:00,390
Commissioner Mei, are you here for shooting?

474
00:36:00,470 --> 00:36:02,605
You may win a silk flower for Princess.

475
00:36:02,686 --> 00:36:03,749
Sure.

476
00:36:03,990 --> 00:36:05,053
I'll do it myself.

477
00:36:06,069 --> 00:36:07,926
I'll earn everything, good or bad, with my own hands.

478
00:36:09,470 --> 00:36:12,151
Your Highness, if you can hit the bell with all three arrows,

479
00:36:12,230 --> 00:36:13,869
you'll win that silk flower.

480
00:36:13,950 --> 00:36:16,151
The bell is hung too high.

481
00:36:16,230 --> 00:36:17,870
It's hard to hit it even once.

482
00:36:20,042 --> 00:36:21,105
Mr. Shu?

483
00:36:22,710 --> 00:36:25,006
Are you looking for my wife?

484
00:36:29,709 --> 00:36:32,846
- That's impressive.   - I was, but I don't need to now.

485
00:36:33,802 --> 00:36:35,179
Shall I pass on a message?

486
00:36:35,550 --> 00:36:38,990
Mr. Mei, how do you know Zhen won't sneak out

487
00:36:39,189 --> 00:36:40,989
to find me once you're asleep?

488
00:36:42,028 --> 00:36:43,124
Between you and me,

489
00:36:43,190 --> 00:36:46,687
who is closer to her? Who shares her struggles?

490
00:36:47,590 --> 00:36:49,206
That's not for you to say.

491
00:36:52,629 --> 00:36:54,566
There's no way she'll hit the third one.

492
00:36:57,983 --> 00:36:59,278
Zhen is stubborn.

493
00:36:59,470 --> 00:37:01,607
She has to try everything herself.

494
00:37:02,510 --> 00:37:06,367
Best to let her run into the wall and learn.

495
00:37:09,150 --> 00:37:10,270
So you...

496
00:37:10,350 --> 00:37:11,726
Mr. Mei, you're late.

497
00:37:12,737 --> 00:37:15,112
You don't know what happened between Zhen and me.

498
00:37:15,377 --> 00:37:16,562
You don't need to ask.

499
00:37:17,169 --> 00:37:19,001
After all, it's been more than 10 years.

500
00:37:19,589 --> 00:37:22,366
It can't be explained to a mere acquaintance.

501
00:37:22,790 --> 00:37:26,646
I'm not interested in any of the stories you're telling.

502
00:37:27,662 --> 00:37:30,678
In the end, whether the bond is deep or shallow,

503
00:37:30,750 --> 00:37:32,749
it's for my wife to decide.

504
00:37:32,830 --> 00:37:33,893
Mei Zhu Yu.

505
00:37:34,910 --> 00:37:38,086
It's not your place to comment on what Zhen and I share.

506
00:37:38,870 --> 00:37:39,966
Just remember this,

507
00:37:40,749 --> 00:37:42,805
if you dare to hurt Zhen,

508
00:37:43,830 --> 00:37:45,406
I will never spare you.

509
00:37:46,422 --> 00:37:48,279
I will protect my wife.

510
00:37:48,630 --> 00:37:49,693
But Mr. Shu,

511
00:37:50,289 --> 00:37:51,949
if you have this much free time,

512
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:54,030
perhaps you should find better things to do.

513
00:37:58,062 --> 00:37:59,125
The autumn nights are cold.

514
00:38:00,110 --> 00:38:02,230
If she comes out to find me in the middle of the night,

515
00:38:02,590 --> 00:38:04,766
do remind her to dress warmly.

516
00:38:17,805 --> 00:38:18,868
Zhu Yu.

517
00:38:20,597 --> 00:38:21,660
What are you looking at?

518
00:38:22,117 --> 00:38:24,733
I just met your friend, Shu.

519
00:38:24,962 --> 00:38:26,440
We exchanged a few words.
