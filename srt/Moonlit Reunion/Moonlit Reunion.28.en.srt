00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,048
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 28)

3
00:01:34,494 --> 00:01:38,791
They realized Chang'an wasn't safe for them.

4
00:01:39,031 --> 00:01:42,327
So they found an abandoned house on the outskirts,

5
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,015
where they're now recovering their strength.

6
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:47,500
What about Chang Ming?

7
00:01:47,585 --> 00:01:48,880
Has he made any moves?

8
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:52,400
Actually, we found their trail

9
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,696
thanks to Sect Leader Chang Ming himself.

10
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,440
How so?

11
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,656
I suspect Sect Leader Chang Ming grew impatient.

12
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
When he sneaked out to practice the Life Transforming art,

13
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:10,336
the foul aura around him was impossible to hide.

14
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,255
That's how I tracked them to that abandoned house.

15
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,023
Well done.

16
00:02:17,216 --> 00:02:21,136
You remain as sharp and capable as ever.

17
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,483
Humans often speak of rats

18
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:26,320
with contempt,

19
00:02:26,719 --> 00:02:28,930
but only we rats

20
00:02:29,199 --> 00:02:30,430
can penetrate any barrier,

21
00:02:30,933 --> 00:02:32,160
reach any place.

22
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,463
Since ancient times,

23
00:02:33,772 --> 00:02:36,296
how many have really achieved greatness?

24
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,166
Yet in the end, only we rats prove impossible to eradicate.

25
00:02:43,759 --> 00:02:45,560
Spoken like a true visionary.

26
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,296
Your words never fail to be persuasive.

27
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,880
You never sided with me before.

28
00:02:54,759 --> 00:02:57,579
Seems even my silver tongue

29
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,633
falls short of Cat Lord's.

30
00:03:01,039 --> 00:03:02,660
How dare you compare yourself to her?

31
00:03:03,919 --> 00:03:04,982
Enough.

32
00:03:06,280 --> 00:03:07,535
You may leave.

33
00:03:09,199 --> 00:03:10,796
Don't let anyone see you.

34
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:21,695
What are you doing here?

35
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:24,280
I've been thinking,

36
00:03:24,759 --> 00:03:28,576
Demon City has been on high alert against those exorcists,

37
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,640
but no matter how tight the net, some fish always slip through.

38
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:33,655
What do you mean?

39
00:03:34,240 --> 00:03:37,640
There's still one person in the city claiming to be an exorcist.

40
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,700
His behavior is highly suspicious.

41
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,920
And this person happens to be someone you know well.

42
00:03:43,759 --> 00:03:44,975
Shuang Jiang?

43
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,262
I'm starving.

44
00:03:58,639 --> 00:04:00,039
I'm about to keel over from hunger.

45
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:07,320
I'm so hungry the world's spinning.

46
00:04:08,639 --> 00:04:09,702
Seniors!

47
00:04:10,719 --> 00:04:12,095
I brought you food.

48
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,143
Where is Sect Leader?

49
00:04:38,399 --> 00:04:39,462
I haven't seen him.

50
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:41,416
He's probably somewhere around.

51
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,360
I-I'll go look for Sect Leader.

52
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:00,822
Go on.

53
00:05:12,199 --> 00:05:15,015
Lady Hu Zhu, it's too dangerous for you here.

54
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,815
You'll be in danger if my senior brothers discover you.

55
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,120
Especially my eldest senior brother, he shows no mercy to demons.

56
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:24,056
You know I'm a demon?

57
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:26,935
Sort of.

58
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,295
Since when?

59
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:29,743
Well...

60
00:05:29,879 --> 00:05:32,935
Since that time we caught the dream demon.

61
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:34,575
You were there that night?

62
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,736
That's not important.

63
00:05:36,879 --> 00:05:38,480
You have to get out of here now.

64
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,040
I'm a hundred years demon,

65
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,136
yet I was actually fooled by a half-baked exorcist!

66
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:43,178
I never fooled you.

67
00:05:43,259 --> 00:05:44,322
Tell me then,

68
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,440
what are you and your people doing in Chang'an?

69
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:54,303
Sect Leader...

70
00:06:04,879 --> 00:06:08,575
Exterminating demons has always been Changxi Palace's sacred duty.

71
00:06:11,240 --> 00:06:12,335
Sect Leader...

72
00:06:14,120 --> 00:06:15,183
Shuang Jiang.

73
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,416
How long have you been mingling with demons?

74
00:06:21,959 --> 00:06:23,022
I...

75
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:24,895
Changxi Palace...

76
00:06:32,879 --> 00:06:34,776
You really are one of them.

77
00:06:35,519 --> 00:06:36,582
I...

78
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,096
A weak fox demon.

79
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:47,733
Sect Leader! She's my closest friend.

80
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:49,656
Please spare her life.

81
00:06:50,040 --> 00:06:52,200
Nonsense! Demon hunting is not child's play!

82
00:06:52,399 --> 00:06:53,462
Move!

83
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,080
I'll rid Demon City of its greatest threat today

84
00:07:03,920 --> 00:07:05,976
even if it will cost my life!

85
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:26,655
Oh Shuang Jiang...

86
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,976
You were such a nuisance.

87
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,640
But even fools have their uses,

88
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,375
as long as they serve my purpose

89
00:07:38,519 --> 00:07:40,056
and help me achieve my goals.

90
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,844
Mei, what are you looking at?

91
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,903
The weather's not good today.

92
00:08:15,839 --> 00:08:17,976
I heard it might rain for several days.

93
00:08:18,759 --> 00:08:20,416
You don't like thunderstorms?

94
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:22,640
It's not about like or dislike.

95
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:25,520
Even thunder serves its purpose.

96
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:32,623
I mean,

97
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:34,735
the sky looked ominous last night.

98
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,063
There might be demons.

99
00:08:36,919 --> 00:08:37,982
Demons?

100
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,656
On two occasions when lightning struck,

101
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,855
once it led me into the Demon City,

102
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:50,213
and once it let Si witness a demon.

103
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:54,136
The barrier must be connected to the lightning.

104
00:08:54,399 --> 00:08:55,462
Purpose?

105
00:08:55,879 --> 00:08:58,640
I've heard of people enjoying the rain, but never the thunder.

106
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:02,080
Your preferences are unique.

107
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:04,217
If your duties are done,

108
00:09:05,799 --> 00:09:06,896
you should go home early.

109
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,200
How come it's just a wisp of a remnant soul?

110
00:11:01,559 --> 00:11:05,776
Such a familiar scent...

111
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,240
So familiar...

112
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,240
Just as I suspected, you've been hiding in Chang'an all along.

113
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:26,200
Lady Hu Zhu? Lady Hu Zhu?

114
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,702
Lady Hu Zhu, are you alright?

115
00:12:38,000 --> 00:12:39,136
I...

116
00:12:41,640 --> 00:12:42,737
No, I'm not.

117
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:45,520
Hang in there, Lady Hu Zhu.

118
00:12:45,826 --> 00:12:47,162
I'm coming to get you.

119
00:13:09,000 --> 00:13:10,296
Shuang Jiang fell off a cliff?

120
00:13:10,759 --> 00:13:13,760
Yes. He went out to find Sect Leader after dropping his bags.

121
00:13:14,759 --> 00:13:17,319
He must have exposed himself and drew the fox demon's attention.

122
00:13:17,679 --> 00:13:18,742
A fox demon?

123
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:21,375
I heard the fox demon is immensely powerful,

124
00:13:21,399 --> 00:13:22,496
and extremely cunning.

125
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:25,079
Luckily, Sect Leader arrived in time and severely wounded it.

126
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:26,800
He meant to capture the creature,

127
00:13:27,000 --> 00:13:29,097
but then Shuang Jiang actually begged him

128
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:30,960
to spare the demon.

129
00:13:31,559 --> 00:13:33,720
He claimed the demon was his closest friend.

130
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,799
But the demon showed no gratitude.

131
00:13:35,879 --> 00:13:37,256
Knowing it couldn't escape,

132
00:13:37,446 --> 00:13:39,326
it dragged Shuang Jiang down the cliff with it.

133
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:42,342
At the end of the day,

134
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:45,600
this is all my negligence as your eldest senior brother.

135
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:48,126
I've been too indulgent with all of you,

136
00:13:48,559 --> 00:13:50,640
letting you experience the mortal world,

137
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:51,975
succumb to its temptations,

138
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:55,320
and stray onto the wrong path.

139
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,840
It is indeed your negligence.

140
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,000
You shouldn't have left the formation

141
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,975
before the foul aura was cleared.

142
00:14:07,679 --> 00:14:09,776
Are you saying it was my mistake that revealed us,

143
00:14:10,332 --> 00:14:11,589
that brought the demon to us?

144
00:14:13,480 --> 00:14:15,760
I'm going to look for Shuang Jiang.

145
00:14:16,519 --> 00:14:19,080
The rest of you, please don't act recklessly.

146
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,183
Lady Hu Zhu? Lady Hu Zhu?

147
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,143
Lady Hu Zhu?

148
00:15:04,879 --> 00:15:06,095
How dare you hit me!

149
00:15:06,572 --> 00:15:07,772
Even badly injured,

150
00:15:07,919 --> 00:15:09,136
you're so fierce.

151
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:11,383
Tell me this.

152
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:15,095
Why did you save me?

153
00:15:15,920 --> 00:15:17,576
Why did you fall off the cliff with me?

154
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,735
I couldn't think of anything else at the time.

155
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:23,200
I just didn't want you to die.

156
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:25,575
Didn't want me to die?

157
00:15:26,879 --> 00:15:28,016
I'm a demon.

158
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,095
You're an exorcist.

159
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:32,176
Wouldn't you kill me?

160
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,423
I...

161
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:35,416
At most, I'd seal you.

162
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:37,735
Did I hurt you?

163
00:15:38,759 --> 00:15:40,119
You make my liver ache with anger!

164
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,623
Fox demons have livers?

165
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:42,783
You...

166
00:16:03,480 --> 00:16:05,856
I left the city in a rush.

167
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:07,735
This flatbread is all I have on me.

168
00:16:09,986 --> 00:16:11,049
You can have it.

169
00:16:17,919 --> 00:16:19,376
Don't worry, it's not poisoned.

170
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,376
I'm a righteous exorcist.

171
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,520
I won't torture an injured demon.

172
00:16:33,080 --> 00:16:35,120
I'm hungry too.

173
00:17:55,559 --> 00:17:57,480
I have to follow Changxi Palace's rules.

174
00:17:58,079 --> 00:18:00,039
Even though we have known each other a long time,

175
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:01,976
when we return to Chang'an,

176
00:18:02,159 --> 00:18:03,655
I have to follow protocol.

177
00:18:04,132 --> 00:18:05,400
I can't defy the rules.

178
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,400
Enough talk.

179
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:09,855
Just hurry up and take me back already.

180
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,726
Fair enough.

181
00:18:11,839 --> 00:18:14,655
I suppose Zhu Yu and Lady Wu must be worried sick now.

182
00:18:18,733 --> 00:18:20,188
Lady Hu Zhu, you're a fox demon.

183
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:22,095
Does that mean my sister-in-law...

184
00:18:22,119 --> 00:18:24,160
Does that mean Lady Wu is one too?

185
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,303
No!

186
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,895
She's not a fox demon.

187
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:30,320
Really? Swear it.

188
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,216
I swear on my cultivation,

189
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,840
she is definitely not a fox demon.

190
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,800
Thank goodness. I was so worried.

191
00:18:41,079 --> 00:18:42,920
Since you're from Changxi Palace,

192
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,056
does that mean Mr. Mei is an exorcist of Changxi Palace too?

193
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,560
He's not.

194
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,335
Cultivators do not lie.

195
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,375
Are you telling the truth?

196
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,959
Yes, I swear!

197
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:55,696
Changxi Palace has ten registered exorcists,

198
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:57,040
and Mei Zhu Yu isn't one of them.

199
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:17,943
Come on.

200
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:23,520
How are you going to taunt me today?

201
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:41,400
Where is it?

202
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:00,720
Up ahead is Chang'an.

203
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:05,760
Shuang Jiang, I'm injured and weak now.

204
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:08,040
If you really want to capture me,

205
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,375
now is your best chance.

206
00:20:18,119 --> 00:20:20,239
Steamed flatbreads! Delicious steamed flatbreads!

207
00:20:20,319 --> 00:20:22,135
The one and only steamed flatbreads!

208
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,240
- It's steamed flatbreads. - Come on!

209
00:20:29,279 --> 00:20:30,655
Care for some steamed flatbreads?

210
00:20:31,519 --> 00:20:33,536
- Two, please. - Alright!

211
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:37,582
Here.

212
00:20:42,400 --> 00:20:43,536
Two flatbreads.

213
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:45,655
That'll be two coins.

214
00:20:48,039 --> 00:20:51,280
Maybe you could let us have these for free?

215
00:20:51,519 --> 00:20:53,736
We didn't bring any money.

216
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,223
No money?

217
00:20:57,519 --> 00:20:59,360
No money, no flatbread!

218
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:01,303
- Wait. - What?

219
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,200
Thank you, beautiful young lady.

220
00:21:20,240 --> 00:21:21,303
Here you go.

221
00:21:26,119 --> 00:21:27,182
Please enjoy.

222
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,095
Lady Hu Zhu, you helped me.

223
00:21:32,319 --> 00:21:33,415
I won't forget that.

224
00:21:33,680 --> 00:21:36,023
But you're a demon, and I'm an exorcist.

225
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:37,863
So...

226
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:39,895
I've come up with an idea.

227
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,463
I will count to ten, and you may flee.

228
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:44,920
But when I finish, if I see you again,

229
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:46,799
I'll have no choice but to do my duty.

230
00:21:48,759 --> 00:21:49,822
You mean it?

231
00:21:51,000 --> 00:21:52,440
You'd really let me go?

232
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:53,943
Yes.

233
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,000
Alright.

234
00:21:58,600 --> 00:21:59,760
Keep your word.

235
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,655
One... Two...

236
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:05,543
Three...

237
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,382
Four...

238
00:22:08,519 --> 00:22:09,582
Five...

239
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:11,543
Six...

240
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:13,063
Seven...

241
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:15,223
Eight...

242
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:18,480
Nine...

243
00:22:54,279 --> 00:22:55,342
This is bad.

244
00:22:56,359 --> 00:22:58,296
I'm turning back to my true form.

245
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:21,743
My lady,

246
00:23:22,680 --> 00:23:24,375
it's noon now.

247
00:23:25,319 --> 00:23:27,496
Surely you haven't forgotten what day it is today?

248
00:23:28,000 --> 00:23:29,063
How could I forget?

249
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:33,120
First day of the tenth month, the Ghost Festival.

250
00:23:35,560 --> 00:23:37,720
Quite the birthday my husband chose.

251
00:23:38,720 --> 00:23:40,440
Are the preparations complete?

252
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:41,840
Rest assured, my lady.

253
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,239
It's such an important day.

254
00:23:43,319 --> 00:23:45,095
I shall ensure everything is flawless.

255
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:03,519
Young Master, His Grace delivered your birthday gift.

256
00:24:03,599 --> 00:24:05,056
I've placed it in the study.

257
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:06,823
Alright.

258
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,855
Mei! Mei!

259
00:24:09,279 --> 00:24:11,342
- We have a problem! - He's here!

260
00:24:11,960 --> 00:24:13,023
What happened?

261
00:24:13,359 --> 00:24:15,256
I know we shouldn't disturb you today, but...

262
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:16,783
Go on.

263
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,775
A vicious wolf has broken loose in the city

264
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:20,256
and nearly attacked passersby.

265
00:24:20,440 --> 00:24:21,680
It's vanished for now.

266
00:24:21,920 --> 00:24:23,295
The yamen fears it may strike again,

267
00:24:23,319 --> 00:24:25,840
so they've ordered every bureau to join the hunt.

268
00:24:25,920 --> 00:24:27,400
- A wolf? - Yes.

269
00:24:27,920 --> 00:24:30,313
I heard the beast is small in build but unusually fierce.

270
00:24:30,519 --> 00:24:32,135
And it has an unusually large tail...

271
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:35,575
An unusually large tail...

272
00:24:37,519 --> 00:24:38,615
That sounds more like...

273
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,703
A fox.

274
00:24:41,160 --> 00:24:42,760
Come on, let's go help them.

275
00:24:43,119 --> 00:24:44,182
Alright.

276
00:25:02,160 --> 00:25:03,335
Commissioner Mei, you came.

277
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,216
I heard the city is hunting a wolf. I've come to assist.

278
00:25:06,319 --> 00:25:07,320
Excellent.

279
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,999
We've scoured eight streets,

280
00:25:09,079 --> 00:25:10,335
but there's been no sign of it.

281
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,680
Who knows where it's hiding.

282
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,815
Where do you plan to look?

283
00:25:14,920 --> 00:25:15,983
The Liu District.

284
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:20,783
Come on.

285
00:25:59,079 --> 00:26:00,415
What happened to her?

286
00:26:00,920 --> 00:26:03,256
Hu Zhu must have stumbled onto the exorcists' trail

287
00:26:03,640 --> 00:26:04,976
and was wounded by them.

288
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:07,616
No time to bring her back to the Demon City.

289
00:26:07,640 --> 00:26:08,880
I have to treat her right here.

290
00:26:20,160 --> 00:26:21,223
Search!

291
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:30,102
Wu Zhen?

292
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:31,536
What are you doing here?

293
00:27:32,319 --> 00:27:33,855
Just taking care of some business.

294
00:27:34,599 --> 00:27:35,736
You, on the other hand,

295
00:27:36,519 --> 00:27:37,783
you brought quite a squad.

296
00:27:38,092 --> 00:27:39,772
What is this, a raid on the Ruyi Pavilion?

297
00:27:40,759 --> 00:27:42,920
Official duty. A wolf is loose in the city.

298
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:46,440
It may harm people, so we're searching door to door.

299
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:48,582
It's a fox.

300
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:50,335
According to witnesses,

301
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:52,879
Witnesses described thick fur and a great long tail.

302
00:27:53,240 --> 00:27:55,135
Sounds far more like a fox.

303
00:27:59,640 --> 00:28:00,776
I haven't seen

304
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:04,095
any wolves or foxes in my room.

305
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:06,263
I see.

306
00:28:06,559 --> 00:28:08,056
I'll take your word for it.

307
00:28:08,359 --> 00:28:12,175
Let's search elsewhere.

308
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:18,246
Just to be safe...

309
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:20,655
We should check.

310
00:28:22,119 --> 00:28:23,479
You don't trust me?

311
00:28:23,559 --> 00:28:24,622
Wu Zhen.

312
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,160
Are you really alright?

313
00:28:29,640 --> 00:28:30,703
Yes.

314
00:28:31,279 --> 00:28:32,776
It's your birthday today.

315
00:28:33,720 --> 00:28:34,895
I'll see you at home later.

316
00:28:47,839 --> 00:28:50,776
Princess Qing He is meeting a man at Ruyi Pavilion!

317
00:28:52,920 --> 00:28:53,983
My dear.

318
00:28:57,039 --> 00:28:58,479
You should go attend to your duties.

319
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,023
Come on.

320
00:29:09,920 --> 00:29:12,376
Aren't you ashamed to resort to such childish tricks?

321
00:29:12,520 --> 00:29:14,800
I've never been ashamed of my feelings for you.

322
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,880
Is Mei Zhu Yu really worth your hesitation?

323
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,600
Why do you think he insisted on coming in just now?

324
00:29:19,680 --> 00:29:21,720
There was a wolf loose in the city. He was worried.

325
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:22,822
Worried?

326
00:29:23,720 --> 00:29:25,895
You've really never once suspected otherwise?

327
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,943
Foxy...

328
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,342
Boss...

329
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:52,503
Shuang Jiang...

330
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:57,280
Shuang Jiang is one of them.

331
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:02,520
I followed them to the outskirts of the city.

332
00:30:03,559 --> 00:30:05,335
There are five in total.

333
00:30:06,039 --> 00:30:08,159
They must've used a formation to mask their presence.

334
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,880
That's why they vanished for days.

335
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:14,080
These aren't ordinary exorcists.

336
00:30:16,039 --> 00:30:17,496
They're from Changxi Palace.

337
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:21,200
If they're really from Changxi Palace,

338
00:30:21,720 --> 00:30:23,375
then his "Tenth Brother" must be...

339
00:30:24,720 --> 00:30:26,335
Shuang Jiang swore

340
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,615
that Mr. Mei isn't

341
00:30:30,319 --> 00:30:32,016
among their ten disciples.

342
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:35,095
He's my husband.

343
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,216
If he's involved,

344
00:30:38,400 --> 00:30:39,736
I cannot overlook it.

345
00:30:45,160 --> 00:30:46,655
I'm afraid our happiness...

346
00:30:48,319 --> 00:30:49,976
Will come to an end soon.

347
00:31:19,079 --> 00:31:20,142
Commissioner Mei.

348
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,736
What's going on with Commissioner Mei?

349
00:31:30,827 --> 00:31:31,890
No idea.

350
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,343
Zhu Yu...

351
00:31:51,480 --> 00:31:53,422
- Zhu Yu... - Shuang Jiang!

352
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:57,640
I thought I'd never see you again.

353
00:31:58,240 --> 00:31:59,303
What happened to you?

354
00:31:59,720 --> 00:32:01,360
I'm fine. I'm just...

355
00:32:02,386 --> 00:32:03,396
Hungry.

356
00:32:04,680 --> 00:32:05,776
Get up.

357
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,280
Easy.

358
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:16,496
What really happened?

359
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,286
Did you escape from that fox demon?

360
00:32:18,759 --> 00:32:21,120
No. Actually, she escaped from me.

361
00:32:25,680 --> 00:32:27,375
So Hu Zhu really is a fox demon?

362
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,216
She has been running a business in Chang'an all this time

363
00:32:39,079 --> 00:32:40,736
without anyone finding out.

364
00:32:42,039 --> 00:32:45,095
Looks like the Demon City harbors many powerful demons.

365
00:32:45,319 --> 00:32:48,095
Perhaps they've been hiding among us all along.

366
00:32:49,559 --> 00:32:50,976
Hiding among us...

367
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:53,503
I'm not a demon, though!

368
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,216
Don't worry.

369
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:59,653
The ones around you are mortals.

370
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,159
I confirmed with her today.

371
00:33:01,446 --> 00:33:03,022
Lady Hu Zhu swore on her cultivation

372
00:33:03,559 --> 00:33:05,546
that your wife is definitely not a fox demon.

373
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:10,736
She knows you're from Changxi Palace,

374
00:33:11,160 --> 00:33:12,655
yet she still spared your life.

375
00:33:14,440 --> 00:33:16,853
Why would she want to kill me?

376
00:33:17,359 --> 00:33:18,880
Sect Leader was the ruthless one.

377
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:21,960
When I parted with Lady Hu Zhu today,

378
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:26,855
I could feel his power lingering inside her.

379
00:33:29,279 --> 00:33:31,480
I wonder how her injuries are now.

380
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:35,000
How could his power stay in her so long?

381
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:41,280
It's a Demon Tracking technique.

382
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:47,560
(Ruyi Pavilion)

383
00:34:07,480 --> 00:34:08,543
Boss?

384
00:34:09,320 --> 00:34:10,456
Wu Zi Shu?

385
00:34:11,720 --> 00:34:12,936
Are you here?

386
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:30,175
Look at the hour.

387
00:34:30,440 --> 00:34:32,520
Ruyi Pavilion's doors are still shut tight.

388
00:34:33,239 --> 00:34:34,615
This is a first.

389
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:37,575
Haven't you heard?

390
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:39,800
Lady Hu Zhu, the owner of Ruyi Pavilion,

391
00:34:39,880 --> 00:34:41,416
seems to have offended someone.

392
00:34:41,559 --> 00:34:44,496
There were Jinwu Guards swarming all over the place earlier today.

393
00:34:44,599 --> 00:34:46,095
Where'd you hear that?

394
00:34:47,199 --> 00:34:48,680
The place is full of pretty women,

395
00:34:48,793 --> 00:34:50,529
singing and dancing all day.

396
00:34:50,720 --> 00:34:51,796
Who could they possibly offend?

397
00:34:51,820 --> 00:34:52,883
You don't believe me?

398
00:34:54,119 --> 00:34:55,775
If that's really the case,

399
00:34:56,079 --> 00:34:57,840
I'll take her under my wings.

400
00:34:57,920 --> 00:34:59,376
I won't let anyone bully her.

401
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:02,376
You? Come on.

402
00:35:02,679 --> 00:35:04,360
Yes, me.

403
00:35:04,440 --> 00:35:05,720
Just drink your tea.

404
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,135
Take a good look in the mirror.

405
00:35:09,496 --> 00:35:12,483
(Ruyi Pavilion)

406
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:53,543
Lady Hu Zhu...

407
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:56,983
Lady Hu Zhu...

408
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:00,343
This is my fault.

409
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:02,135
If I had captured you myself,

410
00:36:02,519 --> 00:36:04,135
you wouldn't be suffering like this.

411
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,063
This power...

412
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,816
What's wrong with my power?

413
00:36:19,386 --> 00:36:20,426
Nothing.

414
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,775
I'm just worried if she dies,

415
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,255
it might ruin your plan.

416
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:24,423
What?

417
00:36:24,760 --> 00:36:26,360
Do you really think we couldn't enter

418
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:28,039
the Demon City without you?

419
00:36:28,165 --> 00:36:29,381
So, did she talk?

420
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,102
No.

421
00:36:32,639 --> 00:36:33,896
It doesn't matter.

422
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:36,255
The tighter her lips,

423
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:38,280
the more useful she is to us.

424
00:36:38,639 --> 00:36:39,702
What do you mean?

425
00:36:40,039 --> 00:36:41,102
The more silent she is,

426
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:44,976
the more it proves her high status in the Demon City.

427
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:47,536
With such perfect bait,

428
00:36:48,039 --> 00:36:49,936
the big fish will come biting.

429
00:37:35,039 --> 00:37:36,102
They're here.

430
00:37:48,159 --> 00:37:49,222
Get ready.

431
00:38:04,039 --> 00:38:06,255
Didn't Lady Hu Zhu tell you?

432
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,496
It's so dark in here.

433
00:38:10,519 --> 00:38:13,816
You'll need more lights if you want to see anyone clearly.

434
00:38:26,119 --> 00:38:27,575
Who are you?

435
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,023
Really?

436
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,416
Surely you're here because you've known who I am.

437
00:38:36,559 --> 00:38:38,695
So the Ruyi Pavilion employs male courtesans now.

438
00:38:40,559 --> 00:38:42,016
Though not very attractive ones.

439
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:46,463
You're courting death.

440
00:38:47,447 --> 00:38:48,582
Tell him to get out here.

441
00:38:49,639 --> 00:38:51,536
You expect to get her with that tone?

442
00:38:53,239 --> 00:38:56,599
Well, what tone should I use to demand my husband?

443
00:38:56,679 --> 00:38:57,742
Your husband?

444
00:38:59,199 --> 00:39:00,959
It's my husband's birthday today.

445
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:02,479
Instead of coming home to celebrate,

446
00:39:02,840 --> 00:39:05,135
he'd rather be here fooling around.

447
00:39:05,800 --> 00:39:07,320
I'm here to catch him in the act.

448
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:08,463
Wait.

449
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:11,416
Who is your husband?

450
00:39:11,679 --> 00:39:12,742
Mei Zhu Yu.

451
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,316
So this is your wife?

452
00:39:29,519 --> 00:39:30,582
Yes.

453
00:39:33,679 --> 00:39:35,496
You're Princess Qing He?

454
00:39:36,679 --> 00:39:37,742
Yes.

455
00:39:39,519 --> 00:39:41,056
I've heard of you

456
00:39:44,400 --> 00:39:45,463
My dear,

457
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,056
who are these people?

458
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,695
My old friends from Quzhou.

459
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,720
We just arrived in Chang'an.

460
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:02,120
We don't know our way around yet,

461
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,601
so we rented the Ruyi Pavilion for a few days' diversion.

462
00:40:07,960 --> 00:40:10,135
You rented the place for a few days' diversion?

463
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:13,215
Yet you stand here in the dark,

464
00:40:13,599 --> 00:40:15,255
neither eating nor drinking.

465
00:40:16,673 --> 00:40:18,295
Quite a novel way to enjoy yourselves.

466
00:40:22,679 --> 00:40:23,816
If you're finished,

467
00:40:24,239 --> 00:40:25,775
may I take my husband home?

468
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:28,343
Of course.

469
00:40:33,199 --> 00:40:36,856
By the way, I was unaware you were coming.

470
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:38,255
Had I known,

471
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:40,255
on this of all days,

472
00:40:40,599 --> 00:40:42,413
I would have invited you to our home.

473
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:43,880
You are too kind.

474
00:40:44,159 --> 00:40:45,222
It's only proper.

475
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:47,215
Important guests like yourselves

476
00:40:47,840 --> 00:40:51,073
deserve nothing less than a grand welcome.
