00:01:27,208 --> 00:01:30,995
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,076 --> 00:01:34,030
(Episode 29)

3
00:01:34,618 --> 00:01:36,925
You rented the place for a few days' diversion?

4
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,765
Yet you stand here in the dark,

5
00:01:40,142 --> 00:01:41,867
neither eating nor drinking.

6
00:01:43,103 --> 00:01:45,240
Quite a novel way to enjoy yourselves.

7
00:01:46,303 --> 00:01:49,388
If you're finished, may I take my husband home?

8
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:50,903
Of course.

9
00:01:55,735 --> 00:01:59,820
By the way, I was unaware you were coming.

10
00:02:00,031 --> 00:02:01,391
Had I known,

11
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:03,280
on this of all days,

12
00:02:03,427 --> 00:02:05,360
I would have invited you to our home.

13
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:06,680
You are too kind.

14
00:02:06,878 --> 00:02:07,941
It's only proper.

15
00:02:08,550 --> 00:02:09,957
Important guests like yourselves

16
00:02:10,463 --> 00:02:14,160
deserve nothing less than a grand welcome.

17
00:02:18,954 --> 00:02:20,017
Let's go.

18
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,880
When Zhu Yu entered White Night Array,

19
00:02:29,159 --> 00:02:30,479
he claimed he had other thoughts.

20
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,726
It turns out it was all for this woman.

21
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:35,365
He's blinded by lust.

22
00:02:36,680 --> 00:02:37,743
Who knows.

23
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,600
Why don't you follow them and take a look?

24
00:02:44,920 --> 00:02:46,081
You're saying...

25
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,240
Nothing.

26
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:49,206
It's just a precaution.

27
00:03:34,233 --> 00:03:36,358
I thought a demon would come to save you,

28
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:41,240
but it seems the Demon City doesn't care about you at all.

29
00:03:42,160 --> 00:03:45,920
What's the point of suffering here for them?

30
00:03:48,585 --> 00:03:51,232
If you tell me how to get into the Demon City now,

31
00:03:51,546 --> 00:03:52,951
you won't have to suffer anymore.

32
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:57,040
Otherwise, I can end your life whenever I wish.

33
00:04:17,920 --> 00:04:19,166
I didn't expect you to come.

34
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,560
And I didn't expect to actually find you there.

35
00:04:31,399 --> 00:04:34,759
Knowing you, you wouldn't go to Ruyi Pavilion to catch me in the act,

36
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:36,605
nor would you believe their words.

37
00:04:37,952 --> 00:04:39,318
Of course you know that.

38
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:43,045
Because you wouldn't be messing around at Ruyi Pavilion in the first place,

39
00:04:43,319 --> 00:04:45,526
and you wouldn't think you could deceive me.

40
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:51,360
Wu Zhen, don't help the evil.

41
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:58,703
Don't move.

42
00:04:59,160 --> 00:05:00,223
Be good.

43
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:09,526
A so-called 'once-in-a-century genius'

44
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:12,120
is nothing more than a common man consumed by desire.

45
00:05:28,120 --> 00:05:31,606
I wanted to give you a surprise today.

46
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:37,806
I never imagined your surprise

47
00:05:38,951 --> 00:05:41,318
would leave me reeling instead.

48
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,623
This is the place.

49
00:06:37,399 --> 00:06:40,885
What you're saying aligns with what we know.

50
00:06:41,080 --> 00:06:43,527
But no matter what we do,

51
00:06:45,827 --> 00:06:47,267
we still can't get in.

52
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,927
The Demon City's entrance lies here.

53
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:57,646
It's warded by a barrier.

54
00:06:58,440 --> 00:07:02,886
Mortals and unregistered demons cannot pass the barrier.

55
00:07:05,106 --> 00:07:07,688
Wu Zhen, let's talk.

56
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:35,647
We'll talk later.

57
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:41,743
Mei Zhu Yu.

58
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,245
When I get back, I'll explain everything.

59
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,485
Lady Hu Zhu.

60
00:08:05,132 --> 00:08:06,195
Please lead the way.

61
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,943
Okay.

62
00:08:58,472 --> 00:08:59,880
(Shadow demon?)

63
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,725
How do you know such an obscure name?

64
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:07,646
I grew up in the countryside

65
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,086
and am used to tales of spirits and demons.

66
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,325
Besides, Lady Wu comes from a prominent family in Chang'an.

67
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,560
You should know why the Arcane Appraisal Bureau was established.

68
00:09:16,879 --> 00:09:19,822
Everything is recorded, so what's so strange about that?

69
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,120
It seems...

70
00:09:21,201 --> 00:09:24,056
It seems that this is what Arcane Appraisal Bureau has been looking for.

71
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,166
When I was in Quzhou, I heard that to get rid of this miasma,

72
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:31,006
you need to find the source and clear it out.

73
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:34,646
You've learned a lot in Quzhou.

74
00:09:36,799 --> 00:09:39,406
But you never said you knew martial arts.

75
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:42,367
Only because Lady Wu never asked.

76
00:09:42,879 --> 00:09:45,526
So where did you learn martial arts, Young Master?

77
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:50,125
I learned some basic skills from a senior when I was a child.

78
00:09:50,759 --> 00:09:52,286
He really does wield Celestial Arts.

79
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:57,685
Boss, if this man has ties to Changxi Palace, we might have a problem.

80
00:09:59,840 --> 00:10:01,045
Where is Mr. Mei?

81
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,046
I haven't seen him since earlier.

82
00:10:05,240 --> 00:10:06,366
I finally found you.

83
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:07,920
- Brother... - Eleventh Brother.

84
00:10:08,933 --> 00:10:10,379
(Eleventh brother?)

85
00:10:10,775 --> 00:10:12,295
(You have so many siblings.)

86
00:10:12,893 --> 00:10:15,171
Yes. It's very lively in Quzhou.

87
00:10:15,353 --> 00:10:17,560
We're a family of 11 distant cousins.

88
00:10:17,840 --> 00:10:19,926
The first 10 are ranked by age.

89
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:23,646
Shuang Jiang and I met last.

90
00:10:31,023 --> 00:10:32,960
(I had someone invite you for a drink.)

91
00:10:33,118 --> 00:10:35,480
Didn't you say you were very busy?

92
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:38,296
I heard my cousin was called here to hunt demons.

93
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,883
I was worried about him, so I came to check on him.

94
00:10:39,907 --> 00:10:42,587
Commissioner Mei, how do you know about this suppression technique?

95
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:45,320
From the Arcane Appraisal Bureau's Records Vault.

96
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:49,006
There's a case file from 60 years ago recording such sorcery.

97
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:51,520
You remember even that?

98
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:52,685
Remarkable memory.

99
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,085
I grew up in Quzhou and was raised by my master.

100
00:10:57,960 --> 00:10:59,646
Even though he has passed away,

101
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,046
I still want to go back and tell him everything.

102
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,406
You want to go back to Quzhou?

103
00:11:05,280 --> 00:11:07,886
Quzhou is far away. I want to set out today.

104
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:11,726
So this is the woman you married?

105
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:12,863
Yes.

106
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:15,127
You are Princess Qing He?

107
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:17,063
Yes.

108
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:22,406
Zhu Yu, who are these people?

109
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,126
A few old friends from Quzhou.

110
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:47,423
Wu Zhen?

111
00:13:04,960 --> 00:13:06,166
You once told me that

112
00:13:07,240 --> 00:13:11,205
the seasons change, and flowers bloom in their own time.

113
00:13:12,200 --> 00:13:15,805
Even with spells, one mustn't defy the natural order.

114
00:13:16,799 --> 00:13:20,965
And now, just to get into the Demon City, you're summoning lightning.

115
00:13:28,692 --> 00:13:30,098
You're determined

116
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,527
to enter the Demon City tonight.

117
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,663
Yes.

118
00:13:43,520 --> 00:13:45,367
Have you ever thought about

119
00:13:46,360 --> 00:13:47,567
what happens to us

120
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,285
after tonight?

121
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:57,205
I didn't mean to hide anything from you.

122
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:01,606
I'm giving you one last choice.

123
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:04,606
If you stop here,

124
00:14:05,240 --> 00:14:07,485
there's still a chance for us.

125
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:10,799
If you insist on entering the Demon City...

126
00:14:10,879 --> 00:14:12,445
If I do enter the Demon City,

127
00:14:14,640 --> 00:14:15,703
what then?

128
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,246
Then this is

129
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:23,886
the end for us.

130
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:40,565
Do you choose them?

131
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:43,685
Or will you choose me?

132
00:16:22,826 --> 00:16:23,889
Kitty.

133
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,343
Cat Lord.

134
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:29,023
Brother Mei's wife is the Cat Lord?

135
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:34,160
Your friends are full of secrets.

136
00:16:35,840 --> 00:16:38,687
You have quite a few relatives too.

137
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,486
Brother Mei, are you okay?

138
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:04,445
Mr. Mei.

139
00:17:04,800 --> 00:17:06,566
Why are you being so aggressive?

140
00:17:06,680 --> 00:17:08,446
What exactly do you want?

141
00:17:09,120 --> 00:17:10,447
What else could we be doing?

142
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,846
Since we practice Celestial Arts,

143
00:17:13,840 --> 00:17:17,640
it is our duty to eliminate demons and evil.

144
00:17:18,520 --> 00:17:20,616
I've seen plenty of Celestial Masters who preach about

145
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,845
righteousness and morality.

146
00:17:22,039 --> 00:17:24,125
They all talk a better game than they play.

147
00:17:24,920 --> 00:17:27,446
I thought Young Master Mei was smart,

148
00:17:28,039 --> 00:17:32,526
but it turns out he's no different from those fools hanging from the ropes.

149
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:34,480
Who are you calling a fool?

150
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,966
You're like a turtle in a jar.

151
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:37,766
And you still deny your stupidity.

152
00:17:40,279 --> 00:17:43,085
I didn't know you two were coming.

153
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:46,565
Had I known, on such a fine day,

154
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:48,599
I would certainly have invited you both home.

155
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:49,920
You're too kind.

156
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,063
It's only right.

157
00:17:51,720 --> 00:17:53,080
For distinguished guests like you,

158
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:57,046
it's my duty to welcome you and make you comfortable.

159
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,600
Sure enough, demons are evil and so treacherous.

160
00:18:04,120 --> 00:18:06,360
You secretly slipped the message through.

161
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,486
Must a demon be wicked by nature?

162
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:11,960
How can good or evil be judged based on someone's origin,

163
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,346
not their actions?

164
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:17,127
This shows the character of Sect Leader Chang Ming.

165
00:18:18,200 --> 00:18:21,887
I'm afraid the Changxi Palace under your rule is in disorder.

166
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:25,366
No wonder it vanished from the world.

167
00:18:27,346 --> 00:18:29,952
The Changxi Palace was driven out by the Demon City back then.

168
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:34,486
Besides, humans and demons can never be the same.

169
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:35,887
What about humans?

170
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:37,846
What about demons?

171
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,205
The demons in the Demon City live and work peacefully,

172
00:18:42,759 --> 00:18:45,206
eating, sleeping, and doing business just like you.

173
00:18:45,640 --> 00:18:47,085
You were born human.

174
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:50,240
What makes you think you're superior?

175
00:18:51,680 --> 00:18:53,640
The classics say that all demons are evil.

176
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:55,206
The classics say?

177
00:18:55,799 --> 00:18:57,805
If the classics were always right,

178
00:18:58,440 --> 00:19:01,927
that idiot Shuang Jiang would've been skinned alive by Hu Zhu long ago.

179
00:19:02,359 --> 00:19:05,246
And you idiots shouldn't even still be alive.

180
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,245
That's the Demon City over there.

181
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,845
Open your stupid eyes and see for yourselves

182
00:19:14,040 --> 00:19:18,920
if it's the corrupt and dirty place you imagine it to be.

183
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,286
Eat well, drink well.

184
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,565
Here's your noodles.

185
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,983
Thanks.

186
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:45,862
Good.

187
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:50,405
That candy store looks like it has some good stuff.

188
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:53,405
These little ones

189
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,405
haven't left the Demon City for hundreds of years.

190
00:20:01,839 --> 00:20:03,605
What did they do wrong?

191
00:20:07,839 --> 00:20:08,966
And you,

192
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,525
with your righteous words, are invading this place.

193
00:20:12,480 --> 00:20:14,486
What do you want to do to them?

194
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,024
Demons are demons.

195
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:21,920
If not eradicated, they will bring disaster.

196
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,583
Mei Zhu Yu.

197
00:20:32,040 --> 00:20:34,485
Even if you've forgotten your duty to the Changxi Palace,

198
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,406
have you forgotten your parents' deaths?

199
00:20:40,799 --> 00:20:42,880
You came to Chang'an to find the Demon City

200
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,926
precisely to avenge them, didn't you?

201
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:48,925
The Divine Fire rained down 18 years ago,

202
00:20:49,839 --> 00:20:52,486
and countless innocents died because of the Demon City.

203
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:54,765
Have you forgotten all that?

204
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:00,886
If you're here about what happened 18 years ago,

205
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:03,405
I'm afraid you've come to the wrong place.

206
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:05,600
You claim it had nothing to do with the Demon City,

207
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:09,365
but words alone prove nothing.

208
00:21:10,559 --> 00:21:11,766
I have proof.

209
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:20,246
I'll take you there.

210
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:55,622
What is this place?

211
00:21:55,839 --> 00:21:56,902
Demon Prison.

212
00:21:57,160 --> 00:22:00,165
Just as the mortal world has laws, so too does the Demon City.

213
00:22:00,260 --> 00:22:02,026
The evidence is here?

214
00:22:02,960 --> 00:22:04,239
What kind of evidence?

215
00:22:04,319 --> 00:22:05,759
You probably planned this all along,

216
00:22:05,799 --> 00:22:08,023
luring us here so you could wipe us all out.

217
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:10,246
Don't be delusional.

218
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:14,125
I'd be disgusted just letting you into the Demon Prison.

219
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,920
It's here.

220
00:22:16,160 --> 00:22:17,246
This is its cell.

221
00:22:18,152 --> 00:22:19,215
Who?

222
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:22,486
Sinister Fiend who unleashed the Divine Fire 18 years ago.

223
00:23:12,599 --> 00:23:15,279
You transformed heaven and earth, created the three realms,

224
00:23:15,359 --> 00:23:16,966
and were worshipped by humans.

225
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:19,007
But now,

226
00:23:20,359 --> 00:23:24,766
it is time for the ruler of this world to change.

227
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,862
Gui Ying, stop.

228
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:40,479
You want the Demon City to be in balance with the human world?

229
00:23:40,560 --> 00:23:42,120
That's extremely stupid.

230
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:48,080
Why should these weak and incompetent mortals be allowed to step on demons?

231
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,526
How unjust!

232
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:53,885
They usually look down on demons, hunt us, kill us,

233
00:23:54,119 --> 00:23:56,805
yet now they can do nothing but beg.

234
00:23:57,440 --> 00:23:58,503
Cat Lord.

235
00:23:58,599 --> 00:24:01,966
This is what Chang'an ought to look like.

236
00:24:02,359 --> 00:24:07,405
We should rule this world.

237
00:24:07,519 --> 00:24:08,966
You are hopeless.

238
00:24:09,072 --> 00:24:12,032
Today, I'll scatter you into ashes.

239
00:24:12,119 --> 00:24:16,605
Do you really think you can kill me?

240
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:21,766
Back then, Sinister Fiend suddenly appeared in Chang'an

241
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,646
and went on a killing spree.

242
00:24:24,680 --> 00:24:27,766
The Demon City paid a heavy price to get rid of it.

243
00:24:28,240 --> 00:24:31,560
The previous Cat Lord even died because of it.

244
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:39,446
But you mortals

245
00:24:40,720 --> 00:24:42,565
are always blinded by obsession,

246
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:45,167
thinking all demons are evil.

247
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:48,926
You refuse to believe that the Demon City once saved you.

248
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,246
That's just one side of the story from your Demon City.

249
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:55,160
Who knows what kind of demonic tricks you used

250
00:24:55,240 --> 00:24:57,325
to create a false illusion to deceive the world.

251
00:24:57,880 --> 00:25:00,255
Cat Lord brought back the Mirror of Clarity at the cost of his life.

252
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:01,526
How can it be fake?

253
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:09,565
Sect Leader, this mirror is indeed made of a unique jade from Mount Rong.

254
00:25:09,640 --> 00:25:11,400
It can see into one's heart and true nature.

255
00:25:11,519 --> 00:25:13,080
It also has many restrictions on it.

256
00:25:13,160 --> 00:25:15,120
The images in the mirror cannot be tampered with.

257
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:16,640
It is indeed the Mirror of Clarity.

258
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:23,565
So, all the images in the mirror are true?

259
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:27,566
Yes, since the Mirror of Clarity has a record, it cannot be wrong.

260
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,825
Mei Zhu Yu, what do you think?

261
00:25:37,240 --> 00:25:38,680
Are you just going to believe them?

262
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,680
I believe in the Mirror of Clarity.

263
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:48,446
We went through all this trouble, only to find the culprit is already dead?

264
00:25:48,599 --> 00:25:49,662
No.

265
00:25:50,000 --> 00:25:52,537
Although the Divine Fire Chaos had nothing to do with the Demon City,

266
00:25:52,561 --> 00:25:54,767
the true culprit is still alive.

267
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:56,903
That's impossible.

268
00:26:11,519 --> 00:26:12,919
The remnant soul of Sinister Fiend.

269
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,463
That's impossible.

270
00:26:15,039 --> 00:26:16,519
Since the remnant soul is still here,

271
00:26:16,759 --> 00:26:19,325
it proves that Sinister Fiend's core has not been destroyed yet.

272
00:26:19,759 --> 00:26:22,405
The soul exists because of the core.

273
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,960
The previous Cat Lord must have brought back

274
00:26:25,039 --> 00:26:27,446
this Mirror of Clarity with only fragments of information

275
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:31,006
to prove to the Demon City that Gui Ying was dead,

276
00:26:31,599 --> 00:26:34,365
when in truth it was only to mislead the world.

277
00:26:42,759 --> 00:26:45,605
Whatever the case, if Sinister Fiend still lingers,

278
00:26:46,079 --> 00:26:48,926
the Demon City will hunt it down to the very end.

279
00:26:50,359 --> 00:26:51,422
If you ask me,

280
00:26:52,079 --> 00:26:54,999
since we've already descended the mountain, why not investigate together?

281
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:19,565
Sect Leader Chang Ming, what are you doing?

282
00:27:20,840 --> 00:27:23,725
I come to the Demon City to slay demons.

283
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:43,006
How could this be? What did the Sect Leader do?

284
00:27:43,400 --> 00:27:46,645
The spell he used to trap Lady Hu Zhu also carried the same evil energy.

285
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:26,125
With so much demonic power for me to use,

286
00:28:26,680 --> 00:28:28,605
how could I just let it go?

287
00:28:35,559 --> 00:28:36,622
This move...

288
00:28:37,160 --> 00:28:38,223
It's him.

289
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:41,405
Another prey has delivered itself.

290
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:50,246
The Demonic Spell from Mount Luwei who devoured demonic energy.

291
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:52,503
Life Transforming Art?

292
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:55,263
How dare he...

293
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,063
Sect Leader

294
00:28:57,920 --> 00:28:59,125
is practicing evil arts.

295
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,526
Brother Chang Ming, stop now!

296
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,199
Don't make things worse!

297
00:29:04,279 --> 00:29:05,342
Worse?

298
00:29:05,960 --> 00:29:07,365
What have I done wrong?

299
00:29:08,599 --> 00:29:13,125
I'm practicing the Life Transforming Art so I can fight against demons.

300
00:29:28,799 --> 00:29:30,365
So it's with you.

301
00:29:33,160 --> 00:29:35,486
Once I've absorbed Gui Ying's core,

302
00:29:36,279 --> 00:29:38,560
it'll be a service to the world by eliminating a scourge.

303
00:29:42,759 --> 00:29:43,822
- Kitty! - Boss!

304
00:29:51,960 --> 00:29:53,885
Evil shares a common root.

305
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,976
The moment the Life Transforming Art is used,

306
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,365
it will attract the core.

307
00:30:00,119 --> 00:30:04,405
Cat Lord must indeed have hidden Lord Gui Ying all along

308
00:30:05,319 --> 00:30:07,405
to mislead everyone.

309
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:17,565
Sinister Fiend's core?

310
00:30:20,433 --> 00:30:21,473
No wonder

311
00:30:21,786 --> 00:30:24,233
he gave all of his power as the Cat Lord to Wu Zhen.

312
00:30:25,000 --> 00:30:26,063
How could this be?

313
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:28,526
Brother Mei.

314
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:30,885
Watch closely.

315
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:33,766
Once I devour Gui Ying's core,

316
00:30:34,913 --> 00:30:36,913
it will be vengeance for your parents.

317
00:30:38,320 --> 00:30:40,120
I'm helping you.

318
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:54,486
I never imagined Lord Gui Ying was sealed within this mongrel.

319
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:58,486
I wonder if this twist is a good thing or a bad thing?

320
00:30:59,018 --> 00:31:00,544
Is it good or bad?

321
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:05,845
How can it be inside her body?

322
00:31:20,412 --> 00:31:21,812
That's not going to work.

323
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,320
Changxi Truncheon has long been mine.

324
00:31:28,280 --> 00:31:30,502
Changxi Truncheon, return!

325
00:31:44,599 --> 00:31:45,805
- Zhen! - Boss!

326
00:31:51,559 --> 00:31:52,622
Mei Zhu Yu!

327
00:31:55,400 --> 00:31:56,999
I am the Sect Leader of Changxi Palace.

328
00:31:57,079 --> 00:31:59,079
How dare you use the Changxi Truncheon to kill me!

329
00:31:59,472 --> 00:32:01,740
Brother Chang Ming, you practice evil arts

330
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:03,840
and are so determined to attack the Demon City.

331
00:32:03,921 --> 00:32:05,967
You're not doing it to eliminate demons and evil,

332
00:32:06,079 --> 00:32:07,966
but to use them for your own gain.

333
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,165
Cultivation is easy for someone with your innate talent.

334
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,805
How could you understand my suffering?

335
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,805
I only chose the path I desired.

336
00:32:20,360 --> 00:32:21,846
What have I done wrong?

337
00:32:32,166 --> 00:32:34,051
How can this be?

338
00:32:34,400 --> 00:32:36,526
Could it be Master?

339
00:32:47,680 --> 00:32:48,743
Chang Ming!

340
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:02,046
Where did you learn this evil art of Life Transforming Art?

341
00:33:02,400 --> 00:33:06,246
I found it by chance while I was looking through some books.

342
00:33:07,080 --> 00:33:08,600
The rules of Changxi Palace are clear.

343
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:11,160
Practitioners who practice evil arts are condemned.

344
00:33:11,240 --> 00:33:12,320
You know this.

345
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:13,463
Master.

346
00:33:15,039 --> 00:33:17,526
It was just a momentary lapse of judgment.

347
00:33:17,720 --> 00:33:18,885
Please forgive me this time.

348
00:33:21,000 --> 00:33:22,063
Master.

349
00:33:23,305 --> 00:33:24,368
Master.

350
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:25,783
I swear,

351
00:33:26,920 --> 00:33:28,765
if I ever practice this evil art again,

352
00:33:30,040 --> 00:33:34,007
my body and soul shall perish, and I shall vanish into thin air.

353
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:40,823
That's enough.

354
00:33:41,792 --> 00:33:45,199
It's not too late to turn back.

355
00:33:46,759 --> 00:33:48,605
Chang Ming, you have to remember,

356
00:33:48,960 --> 00:33:51,040
the path of cultivation is like climbing a mountain.

357
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:53,479
There may be shortcuts on the rugged side.

358
00:33:53,559 --> 00:33:54,805
It may seem tempting,

359
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,405
but once you step on it,

360
00:33:56,839 --> 00:34:00,839
you can fall off a cliff at any time and be completely shattered.

361
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:08,926
Before you came to the Changxi Palace,

362
00:34:10,600 --> 00:34:13,247
I was always the candidate to succeed as Sect Leader.

363
00:34:17,040 --> 00:34:18,927
But since you arrived,

364
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:22,965
Master had been having second thoughts.

365
00:34:29,120 --> 00:34:30,183
I lost again.

366
00:34:30,880 --> 00:34:33,479
I know your moves, but you don't know mine.

367
00:34:33,559 --> 00:34:34,622
I just got lucky.

368
00:34:35,018 --> 00:34:36,138
You don't have to be humble.

369
00:34:36,458 --> 00:34:37,521
I'm older than you.

370
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:39,366
I shouldn't have lost.

371
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,605
Master, it's my turn to clean the schoolroom today.

372
00:34:44,920 --> 00:34:46,039
I'll be going now.

373
00:34:46,119 --> 00:34:47,182
Go on.

374
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:56,526
Don't be disheartened.

375
00:34:57,239 --> 00:35:00,526
Though Zhu Yu is younger than you and joined late,

376
00:35:00,920 --> 00:35:05,200
he is the most talented disciple the Changxi Palace has had in 100 years,

377
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:06,605
and he has a firm character.

378
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:09,765
What a pity.

379
00:35:10,599 --> 00:35:12,966
If it weren't for his mortal affairs,

380
00:35:13,360 --> 00:35:15,320
I would have kept him here to be the Sect Leader.

381
00:35:15,366 --> 00:35:16,429
Master.

382
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:19,086
The position has always been passed down to the eldest disciple.

383
00:35:19,247 --> 00:35:21,972
I know, I was just saying.

384
00:35:24,199 --> 00:35:26,886
Chang Ming, compared to Zhu Yu,

385
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:30,085
is far less talented.

386
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,015
Talent is something you're born with.

387
00:35:43,039 --> 00:35:44,245
I'm not as good as you.

388
00:35:49,599 --> 00:35:51,046
I have no choice.

389
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,887
He was just one step away.

390
00:36:35,960 --> 00:36:39,685
Lord Gui Ying was about to reappear.

391
00:36:40,639 --> 00:36:43,366
That little mongrel is so lucky.

392
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,560
Zhu Ying is still guarding the barrier entrance.

393
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,367
Ling Xiao, go and help her.

394
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:07,926
See if it can be repaired.

395
00:37:08,440 --> 00:37:09,503
Yes.

396
00:37:14,519 --> 00:37:15,926
This was our fault.

397
00:37:16,239 --> 00:37:17,759
Even with the Sect Leader's deception,

398
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,807
we believed him so easily because of our past prejudices,

399
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,520
thinking that all demons are evil.

400
00:37:25,239 --> 00:37:26,359
And I am even more at fault.

401
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:29,017
I was the first to come down the mountain before my senior brothers.

402
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:32,366
The moment I arrived in Chang'an, I met Lady Hu Zhu and Lady Wu.

403
00:37:33,400 --> 00:37:36,605
They never harmed me and even took care of me often.

404
00:37:37,240 --> 00:37:40,445
But even so, I didn't trust my own eyes and feelings

405
00:37:41,480 --> 00:37:44,685
and still followed the Sect Leader's orders to turn my sword against them.

406
00:37:45,186 --> 00:37:46,249
I'm really sorry.

407
00:37:47,239 --> 00:37:49,639
We only heard stories about the treachery of the Demon City,

408
00:37:49,840 --> 00:37:55,360
but just now we saw food stalls and shops, demons living their daily lives.

409
00:37:56,480 --> 00:37:58,767
If we had not barged in,

410
00:38:00,512 --> 00:38:03,552
they would still be living in peace.

411
00:38:06,280 --> 00:38:08,760
If you all think that Chang Ming's death

412
00:38:08,841 --> 00:38:11,241
is not enough to atone for what the Changxi Palace has done,

413
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:15,726
I am willing to stay and be at your disposal.

414
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:22,285
But can the others be allowed to leave first?

415
00:38:24,519 --> 00:38:29,046
Since you've said that, our Demon City isn't unreasonable.

416
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:34,280
We don't want it to be said that we bully mortals.

417
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:36,406
You may leave.

418
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:39,326
But from this day onward,

419
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,685
Changxi Palace must never trouble the Demon City.

420
00:38:46,079 --> 00:38:47,725
Two powers

421
00:38:49,240 --> 00:38:50,645
cannot coexist.

422
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:57,023
From now on,

423
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:00,806
Changxi Palace is barred from Chang'an.

424
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:11,262
Hu Zhu.

425
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:13,463
See them out.

426
00:39:16,039 --> 00:39:17,102
Gentlemen,

427
00:39:18,360 --> 00:39:19,645
please come with me.

428
00:39:40,120 --> 00:39:42,405
How are you feeling?

429
00:39:42,760 --> 00:39:43,926
You should leave too.

430
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:52,263
Mei Zhu Yu.

431
00:39:53,960 --> 00:39:55,406
Stay away from Zhen.

432
00:39:58,160 --> 00:39:59,223
Mei Zhu Yu.

433
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,846
You saw with your own eyes that

434
00:40:06,639 --> 00:40:08,366
the murderer who killed your father

435
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:13,245
lives inside me.

436
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,702
Kitty.

437
00:40:29,087 --> 00:40:30,896
It must be the influence of Life Transforming Art.

438
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:33,440
Mr. Mei, don't worry. I'll take good care of her.
