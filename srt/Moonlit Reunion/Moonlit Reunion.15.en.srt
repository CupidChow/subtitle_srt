00:01:27,176 --> 00:01:31,003
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,091 --> 00:01:33,960
(Episode 15)

3
00:01:58,408 --> 00:01:59,768
When I took you away,

4
00:02:00,095 --> 00:02:01,640
I left a hidden talisman on the door.

5
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:14,593
The Verification Talisman

6
00:02:15,375 --> 00:02:17,280
can verify the spells used by visitors.

7
00:02:17,902 --> 00:02:19,935
If the visitor used an evil spell,

8
00:02:20,421 --> 00:02:21,600
it will turn black.

9
00:02:21,861 --> 00:02:23,055
If it uses a Taoism spell,

10
00:02:23,182 --> 00:02:24,480
it will have a white glow.

11
00:02:25,661 --> 00:02:26,814
If a normal person enters,

12
00:02:27,062 --> 00:02:28,062
it won't glow.

13
00:02:29,182 --> 00:02:31,534
Then, red means...

14
00:02:33,502 --> 00:02:34,502
Demonic Spells.

15
00:02:34,942 --> 00:02:35,942
Demonic Spells?

16
00:02:37,381 --> 00:02:38,495
Master said it before.

17
00:02:40,101 --> 00:02:41,215
Why don't I remember?

18
00:02:48,861 --> 00:02:49,861
Demonic Spells

19
00:02:50,622 --> 00:02:52,094
are spells from the Western Regions.

20
00:02:52,463 --> 00:02:53,943
It uses flesh and blood as a catalyst

21
00:02:54,022 --> 00:02:55,254
to activate the spell.

22
00:02:56,022 --> 00:02:57,335
Its power might be limited

23
00:02:58,581 --> 00:03:01,215
but the way it is cultivated is extremely cruel.

24
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:04,414
I think you got poisoned

25
00:03:04,902 --> 00:03:06,814
because someone did it on purpose.

26
00:03:08,742 --> 00:03:09,742
But...

27
00:03:10,782 --> 00:03:12,295
When did I get poisoned?

28
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:14,960
I ate the same food and slept in the same place as you.

29
00:03:15,302 --> 00:03:16,822
Why was I the only one being poisoned?

30
00:03:23,661 --> 00:03:25,015
I didn't drink the wine

31
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:26,182
during the banquet.

32
00:03:26,782 --> 00:03:28,175
I didn't eat any food either.

33
00:03:29,653 --> 00:03:31,007
Are you talking about

34
00:03:31,701 --> 00:03:32,701
Pei Ji Ya?

35
00:03:32,942 --> 00:03:34,974
Why would he repay kindness with hatred?

36
00:03:37,342 --> 00:03:38,694
If he did it on purpose,

37
00:03:39,421 --> 00:03:40,694
our act of kindness

38
00:03:41,222 --> 00:03:43,015
might also be a part of his plan.

39
00:03:44,062 --> 00:03:47,414
Moreover, he mentioned the realms of Chang'an as well.

40
00:03:48,381 --> 00:03:49,974
Now that Demonic Spells are involved,

41
00:03:51,421 --> 00:03:52,421
we must be more cautious.

42
00:03:53,302 --> 00:03:54,302
Well,

43
00:03:54,541 --> 00:03:55,661
how do we prepare ourselves?

44
00:03:56,902 --> 00:03:57,959
You should depart immediately

45
00:03:57,983 --> 00:03:59,878
and rush to Changxi Palace to explain the situation.

46
00:03:59,902 --> 00:04:00,902
I'll return to Chang'an

47
00:04:01,022 --> 00:04:02,055
and investigate him.

48
00:04:02,502 --> 00:04:03,502
All right.

49
00:05:27,062 --> 00:05:28,062
Wu Zhen!

50
00:05:30,062 --> 00:05:31,062
Wu Zhen!

51
00:08:02,821 --> 00:08:03,821
Are you all right?

52
00:08:10,581 --> 00:08:11,581
Ji Ya.

53
00:08:12,381 --> 00:08:14,374
It has been so long, Wu Zhen.

54
00:08:23,742 --> 00:08:25,935
Do you know what happened at Ruyi Pavilion last night?

55
00:08:26,021 --> 00:08:28,134
I heard Princess Qinghe had a new man she fancies.

56
00:08:28,261 --> 00:08:30,894
Lady Wu Zhen is still the same.

57
00:08:34,157 --> 00:08:36,534
(Mei Residence)

58
00:08:36,621 --> 00:08:37,734
Me?

59
00:08:38,718 --> 00:08:40,192
You need my help?

60
00:08:40,542 --> 00:08:43,535
Yes. You've been attending many banquets all the time.

61
00:08:43,782 --> 00:08:45,454
Do you know any city gate guards?

62
00:08:49,182 --> 00:08:50,334
I do know them.

63
00:08:51,062 --> 00:08:52,062
What is it?

64
00:08:52,501 --> 00:08:53,935
When I returned to the city,

65
00:08:54,142 --> 00:08:56,214
I noticed someone suspicious.

66
00:08:56,621 --> 00:08:58,141
I want to know something

67
00:08:58,221 --> 00:08:59,454
to clear my doubts.

68
00:09:00,422 --> 00:09:01,535
If you are not in a rush,

69
00:09:01,662 --> 00:09:02,741
give me two days

70
00:09:02,821 --> 00:09:03,974
to be close to them.

71
00:09:04,221 --> 00:09:06,021
Then, I'll be able to ask anything from them.

72
00:09:06,302 --> 00:09:08,015
Sure. Thank you, Fourth Brother.

73
00:09:08,902 --> 00:09:09,902
It's nothing much.

74
00:09:11,981 --> 00:09:12,981
That's right.

75
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,614
When I came back,

76
00:09:14,736 --> 00:09:16,719
I heard many people talking about Lady Wu Zhen.

77
00:09:17,182 --> 00:09:18,655
Has she been doing well?

78
00:09:21,902 --> 00:09:22,902
She is very well.

79
00:09:23,741 --> 00:09:25,255
Without you in Chang'an,

80
00:09:25,581 --> 00:09:27,055
Miss Zhen moved on.

81
00:09:27,581 --> 00:09:30,494
Right now, the new person is better.

82
00:09:30,821 --> 00:09:32,214
You are old news now.

83
00:09:32,902 --> 00:09:34,574
Chang'an is talking about

84
00:09:35,182 --> 00:09:37,021
Princess Qinghe with another young man

85
00:09:37,101 --> 00:09:38,574
in Ruyi Pavilion.

86
00:09:38,942 --> 00:09:41,535
They were acting intimate while everyone was looking at them.

87
00:09:42,902 --> 00:09:44,135
A young man?

88
00:09:46,422 --> 00:09:47,462
I won't tease you anymore.

89
00:09:47,782 --> 00:09:48,782
This legend

90
00:09:48,981 --> 00:09:51,094
is only half true.

91
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:53,614
Which half is true?

92
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,614
They were acting intimate, but the person wasn't someone new.

93
00:09:59,262 --> 00:10:00,262
What do you mean?

94
00:10:01,542 --> 00:10:02,935
Well...

95
00:10:03,101 --> 00:10:04,694
The man isn't a stranger.

96
00:10:04,861 --> 00:10:07,094
He is Miss Zhen's childhood friend.

97
00:10:07,902 --> 00:10:09,614
Her uncle's adopted son.

98
00:10:13,902 --> 00:10:15,614
The eldest son of Kunzhou's Pei family,

99
00:10:16,221 --> 00:10:17,574
Pei Ji Ya.

100
00:10:21,142 --> 00:10:23,375
I am Pei Ji Ya from Kunzhou.

101
00:10:25,501 --> 00:10:26,501
The Verification Talisman

102
00:10:27,062 --> 00:10:28,775
can verify the spells used by visitors.

103
00:10:29,501 --> 00:10:31,655
Then, red means...

104
00:10:33,182 --> 00:10:34,182
Demonic Spells.

105
00:10:37,745 --> 00:10:40,720
(Duke Wu's Residence)

106
00:10:50,142 --> 00:10:51,781
Mr. Mei, you're back?

107
00:10:51,861 --> 00:10:53,597
- Where's Lady Wu Zhen? - In the back yard.

108
00:10:53,621 --> 00:10:54,941
There's a guest in the residence.

109
00:11:14,741 --> 00:11:15,854
It really is you.

110
00:11:17,542 --> 00:11:18,734
Why are you here?

111
00:11:21,902 --> 00:11:24,062
I see. The person Mr. Pei is searching for in Chang'an

112
00:11:24,461 --> 00:11:25,694
is Lady Wu Zhen.

113
00:11:26,022 --> 00:11:28,375
Are you surprised?

114
00:11:29,782 --> 00:11:33,214
Mr. Mei, you're here for Ji Ya.

115
00:11:35,382 --> 00:11:37,621
I heard what happened between you two from Ji Ya.

116
00:11:37,701 --> 00:11:38,701
What did he tell you?

117
00:11:39,382 --> 00:11:42,261
I told Wu Zhen about our meeting

118
00:11:42,341 --> 00:11:43,581
as a form of interesting story.

119
00:11:44,262 --> 00:11:47,694
I didn't expect Wu Zhen to know you, Mr. Mei.

120
00:11:48,062 --> 00:11:49,334
It was really surprising.

121
00:11:49,484 --> 00:11:50,724
What kind of interesting story?

122
00:11:51,821 --> 00:11:53,182
Don't you know

123
00:11:53,262 --> 00:11:54,655
what you did, Mr. Mei?

124
00:11:54,907 --> 00:11:57,499
Don't worry, I only told the truth.

125
00:11:57,701 --> 00:11:59,862
Mr. Mei met me by chance

126
00:11:59,942 --> 00:12:01,734
and encountered bandits.

127
00:12:02,101 --> 00:12:05,775
They scared my servants, Wu and Zhen.

128
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,334
It was Mr. Mei who saved them.

129
00:12:08,981 --> 00:12:10,421
Later, you ate and chatted

130
00:12:10,501 --> 00:12:11,734
with us.

131
00:12:12,182 --> 00:12:16,015
Both of them are still admiring you until now.

132
00:12:16,262 --> 00:12:17,262
That's right, Wu Zhen.

133
00:12:17,902 --> 00:12:21,175
Mr. Mei also wishes the best for us.

134
00:12:23,022 --> 00:12:24,022
Look.

135
00:12:24,302 --> 00:12:25,375
He is really generous.

136
00:12:27,422 --> 00:12:28,542
He has always been generous.

137
00:12:32,782 --> 00:12:35,734
Mr. Mei, why are you here?

138
00:12:35,981 --> 00:12:38,614
Why is Mr. Pei here?

139
00:12:41,142 --> 00:12:43,935
It's rare for you to be interested in someone else, Mr. Mei.

140
00:12:45,902 --> 00:12:47,055
The Pei family is

141
00:12:47,621 --> 00:12:49,015
in the spice business.

142
00:12:49,302 --> 00:12:50,734
Ji Ya has come all the way here

143
00:12:51,101 --> 00:12:52,535
for the Grand Aromatics Competition

144
00:12:52,965 --> 00:12:55,246
and he'll be staying at the Duke's Residence temporarily.

145
00:12:58,942 --> 00:13:00,015
Forgive me, Mr. Mei.

146
00:13:00,621 --> 00:13:03,015
My hobby is making fragrances

147
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:05,055
so I'm sensitive to smell.

148
00:13:10,382 --> 00:13:11,382
Lady Wu Zhen,

149
00:13:11,942 --> 00:13:13,494
you took my horse carriage yesterday.

150
00:13:14,022 --> 00:13:15,454
I had to walk back.

151
00:13:15,942 --> 00:13:18,055
I'm sure my leg got injured again.

152
00:13:18,581 --> 00:13:19,581
I had no choice

153
00:13:19,981 --> 00:13:21,574
but to disturb you for a few more days.

154
00:13:24,902 --> 00:13:26,415
I'm afraid that's not right.

155
00:13:26,757 --> 00:13:28,477
The inner courtyard of the Duke's Residence

156
00:13:28,581 --> 00:13:30,621
isn't for outsiders.

157
00:13:30,701 --> 00:13:31,734
If you can stay here,

158
00:13:32,182 --> 00:13:33,375
so can I.

159
00:13:33,942 --> 00:13:35,094
We are different.

160
00:13:35,782 --> 00:13:38,175
Wu Zhen and I are childhood friends.

161
00:13:38,701 --> 00:13:40,814
I stayed here when I was young.

162
00:13:40,902 --> 00:13:43,574
Lady Wu Zhen and I went through life and death together.

163
00:13:43,981 --> 00:13:46,135
I also stayed here a while ago.

164
00:13:48,022 --> 00:13:49,022
Enough.

165
00:13:49,302 --> 00:13:50,494
Both of you may stay here.

166
00:13:51,821 --> 00:13:53,535
The Duke's Residence

167
00:13:54,302 --> 00:13:55,574
can accommodate ten of you.

168
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:23,415
Lady Wu Zhen, Mr. Mei said he wanted to leave.

169
00:14:23,501 --> 00:14:24,854
Why has he moved back suddenly?

170
00:14:27,221 --> 00:14:29,454
Did you know that he would be back?

171
00:14:30,142 --> 00:14:31,142
I don't know.

172
00:14:31,981 --> 00:14:33,462
However, after I heard Ji Ya

173
00:14:33,542 --> 00:14:35,454
mentioned their meeting in the Western Region,

174
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:36,806
I was guessing

175
00:14:37,461 --> 00:14:38,982
that he might come back.

176
00:14:39,062 --> 00:14:40,574
Because of Mr. Pei?

177
00:14:40,981 --> 00:14:42,935
Mr. Mei is so weird.

178
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:45,655
He isn't weird.

179
00:14:45,861 --> 00:14:47,135
I do think

180
00:14:48,302 --> 00:14:49,775
Zi Ya is acting weird instead.

181
00:14:53,422 --> 00:14:54,862
I wonder what concerns you have

182
00:14:54,942 --> 00:14:56,334
about these two men.

183
00:14:59,062 --> 00:15:00,614
Are you going to inform Sister again?

184
00:15:01,182 --> 00:15:02,974
Please give me an answer, Lady Wu Zhen.

185
00:15:06,262 --> 00:15:07,775
I will be impartial

186
00:15:08,662 --> 00:15:09,935
and observe them.

187
00:15:17,981 --> 00:15:20,655
Mr. Mei, what do you think about this?

188
00:15:22,542 --> 00:15:23,734
Mr. Pei,

189
00:15:24,182 --> 00:15:26,535
was it a coincidence when we met at the Western Region?

190
00:15:28,182 --> 00:15:29,694
Coincidences don't happen so often.

191
00:15:30,022 --> 00:15:31,094
It's all fate.

192
00:15:31,542 --> 00:15:32,542
Did you

193
00:15:32,662 --> 00:15:35,574
go to my room last night, Mr. Pei?

194
00:15:40,101 --> 00:15:42,734
Did you lose anything, Mr. Mei?

195
00:15:44,902 --> 00:15:45,902
I didn't.

196
00:15:46,341 --> 00:15:47,341
That's great.

197
00:15:47,662 --> 00:15:50,214
There's actually no need for you to guess my purpose

198
00:15:50,341 --> 00:15:51,655
of coming to Chang'an, Mr. Mei.

199
00:15:52,262 --> 00:15:54,214
I came here for the Grand Aromatics Competition

200
00:15:55,022 --> 00:15:56,375
but I don't care about that.

201
00:15:56,782 --> 00:15:57,782
What I care about

202
00:15:58,022 --> 00:15:59,022
is Wu Zhen.

203
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,461
I can see that.

204
00:16:04,142 --> 00:16:05,142
A few days ago,

205
00:16:05,501 --> 00:16:07,415
you told me about the lady you fancy.

206
00:16:08,182 --> 00:16:09,214
Was it Wu Zhen?

207
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:10,782
Yes.

208
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:12,895
If you care about Wu Zhen so much,

209
00:16:13,142 --> 00:16:16,055
why would you say both of you weren't fated together?

210
00:16:17,701 --> 00:16:19,135
I have my reasons.

211
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:21,734
It seems like

212
00:16:21,942 --> 00:16:24,135
Wu Zhen isn't that important in your heart.

213
00:16:28,302 --> 00:16:30,182
Mr. Mei, your room is ready.

214
00:16:30,262 --> 00:16:31,614
You may rest in your room.

215
00:16:47,182 --> 00:16:48,454
I told you

216
00:16:48,581 --> 00:16:50,375
that you should use a heavier dose.

217
00:16:50,902 --> 00:16:51,902
I have been

218
00:16:52,542 --> 00:16:54,334
too kind.

219
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,400
(Duke Wu's Residence)

220
00:17:23,061 --> 00:17:25,534
I remember we used to play this often when we were young.

221
00:17:25,781 --> 00:17:27,694
However, it was way simpler back then.

222
00:17:27,902 --> 00:17:29,815
The arrows were not as fancy as this.

223
00:17:30,501 --> 00:17:32,454
Our lives are supposed to get better and better.

224
00:17:33,741 --> 00:17:35,318
I think it was better when we were young.

225
00:17:35,342 --> 00:17:37,615
There were only you and me.

226
00:17:44,061 --> 00:17:45,974
Your skills in this game, on the other hand,

227
00:17:46,822 --> 00:17:48,415
had become worse.

228
00:17:49,741 --> 00:17:51,741
Indeed. I haven't played this game for many years.

229
00:17:56,902 --> 00:17:59,415
I heard you like stories about talented men and pretty women.

230
00:18:00,021 --> 00:18:02,415
These are popular right now.

231
00:18:03,182 --> 00:18:04,462
I helped you gather all of them.

232
00:18:05,102 --> 00:18:06,142
I don't like them anymore.

233
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:08,061
All of them are stories

234
00:18:08,142 --> 00:18:10,141
about young women's choices of spouse,

235
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:12,398
woven with deep emotions and lingering, poignant romance.

236
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:13,422
How boring.

237
00:18:15,501 --> 00:18:17,494
The story might be old-fashioned

238
00:18:17,622 --> 00:18:19,095
but they have good endings.

239
00:18:21,061 --> 00:18:22,061
Good endings?

240
00:18:23,061 --> 00:18:24,095
How so?

241
00:18:25,942 --> 00:18:27,014
Do they end up married?

242
00:18:27,102 --> 00:18:29,375
The most important thing in a woman's life

243
00:18:29,701 --> 00:18:31,141
is to find a man suitable for her.

244
00:18:31,221 --> 00:18:33,182
- Why? - What?

245
00:18:34,701 --> 00:18:37,014
I'm asking you

246
00:18:37,342 --> 00:18:39,375
why the most important thing in a woman's life

247
00:18:39,501 --> 00:18:40,941
is to find a man suitable for her?

248
00:18:41,021 --> 00:18:42,534
A woman is weak and gentle.

249
00:18:42,822 --> 00:18:45,655
She needs to find a person to rely on

250
00:18:45,862 --> 00:18:47,582
who can protect her like a treasure

251
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:50,095
for her whole life.

252
00:18:52,942 --> 00:18:54,054
You are right.

253
00:18:55,021 --> 00:18:57,534
The most important thing in a woman's life

254
00:18:58,582 --> 00:19:00,615
is to find a reliable person.

255
00:19:28,061 --> 00:19:29,638
There are demons causing him trouble again?

256
00:19:29,662 --> 00:19:31,141
This book demon is useless.

257
00:19:31,221 --> 00:19:32,221
Indeed.

258
00:19:44,862 --> 00:19:46,694
Do you have all kinds of books here?

259
00:19:53,422 --> 00:19:55,254
Which book are you looking for?

260
00:19:56,021 --> 00:19:58,981
The old men of the Four Sects want me to fortify the Demon City's barrier.

261
00:19:59,582 --> 00:20:01,095
I'm here to find a method.

262
00:20:01,382 --> 00:20:02,855
Demon City's barrier?

263
00:20:03,781 --> 00:20:04,781
You are...

264
00:20:06,142 --> 00:20:07,454
I am the Cat Lord.

265
00:20:33,182 --> 00:20:34,302
I have something to ask you.

266
00:20:34,461 --> 00:20:37,541
Do you still remember how to make the sugar pastry from before?

267
00:20:38,261 --> 00:20:39,261
I do.

268
00:20:46,862 --> 00:20:48,182
Is the Serpent Lord not here yet?

269
00:20:48,461 --> 00:20:49,862
It might take a while.

270
00:20:49,942 --> 00:20:51,935
I'm here to bring some snacks for you.

271
00:20:52,461 --> 00:20:53,694
I didn't order any food.

272
00:20:55,301 --> 00:20:57,774
Someone told me to bring this to you, Cat Lord.

273
00:21:12,142 --> 00:21:13,421
I told you

274
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:14,734
not to eat so much sugar.

275
00:21:15,221 --> 00:21:17,214
See? You're having a toothache now.

276
00:21:19,501 --> 00:21:21,054
Enough.

277
00:21:23,422 --> 00:21:24,774
It's for your own good.

278
00:21:26,644 --> 00:21:27,688
Don't worry.

279
00:21:27,781 --> 00:21:28,895
I'll go to the gathering

280
00:21:28,981 --> 00:21:29,981
in your place later.

281
00:21:30,942 --> 00:21:32,957
You only scolded Elder Gray because you were in a bad mood

282
00:21:32,981 --> 00:21:34,375
due to the toothache.

283
00:21:34,862 --> 00:21:36,655
Those old men dare not do anything to you.

284
00:21:37,981 --> 00:21:38,981
Thank you.

285
00:21:39,981 --> 00:21:41,661
I'm willing to clean up your mess for you.

286
00:22:04,461 --> 00:22:06,494
Didn't Wu Zi Shu ban this sweet

287
00:22:06,741 --> 00:22:07,981
for being too sweet

288
00:22:08,062 --> 00:22:10,118
to prevent it from hurting the little demons' teeth?

289
00:22:10,142 --> 00:22:11,575
Why has it been sold again?

290
00:22:12,061 --> 00:22:13,061
I don't know.

291
00:22:14,342 --> 00:22:16,935
I heard you've had two men by your side in recent days.

292
00:22:17,261 --> 00:22:18,375
What a happy life.

293
00:22:19,741 --> 00:22:21,878
It's rare for you to be so well-informed, Serpent Lord.

294
00:22:21,902 --> 00:22:23,095
It's not what I want.

295
00:22:23,582 --> 00:22:24,855
However,

296
00:22:24,942 --> 00:22:27,254
news of this has spread all over Chang'an.

297
00:22:27,781 --> 00:22:29,301
It's hard for me not to hear about it.

298
00:22:29,422 --> 00:22:31,694
Did you ask me here to nag me?

299
00:22:37,182 --> 00:22:38,182
Actually,

300
00:22:38,781 --> 00:22:39,815
there's one thing.

301
00:22:42,541 --> 00:22:43,541
Are you going to beg me?

302
00:22:45,862 --> 00:22:47,615
The Grand Aromatics Competition is coming.

303
00:22:47,781 --> 00:22:49,774
I've been a judge for all these years.

304
00:22:50,582 --> 00:22:51,895
However, I haven't been

305
00:22:52,822 --> 00:22:54,494
feeling too well recently.

306
00:22:55,342 --> 00:22:56,575
Are you shedding?

307
00:23:00,422 --> 00:23:02,782
I can't stand reptile demons.

308
00:23:02,862 --> 00:23:04,415
You shed so frequently.

309
00:23:05,942 --> 00:23:08,175
Just say it. Will you help me or not?

310
00:23:10,422 --> 00:23:11,422
Beg me.

311
00:23:14,822 --> 00:23:15,822
Please.

312
00:23:19,261 --> 00:23:20,694
Fine. I'll help you.

313
00:23:21,741 --> 00:23:22,741
However...

314
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:24,301
What is it?

315
00:23:25,781 --> 00:23:27,855
Speaking of the judge of fragrances,

316
00:23:28,221 --> 00:23:30,054
I know nothing about fragrances.

317
00:23:30,541 --> 00:23:32,054
How can I become a judge?

318
00:23:32,301 --> 00:23:35,135
Many experienced judges will be present.

319
00:23:35,582 --> 00:23:37,142
You just need to follow their judgment.

320
00:23:37,221 --> 00:23:39,502
Moreover, Ling Xiao will also be there. He will help you.

321
00:23:49,822 --> 00:23:50,935
I'm done.

322
00:23:51,301 --> 00:23:52,375
I'll leave you two alone.

323
00:23:57,021 --> 00:23:58,021
Kit...

324
00:23:59,301 --> 00:24:00,301
My Lord.

325
00:24:00,902 --> 00:24:01,902
It's time to take a bath.

326
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:06,422
I was being too extreme

327
00:24:07,221 --> 00:24:08,221
previously.

328
00:24:09,533 --> 00:24:10,541
Don't be angry.

329
00:24:14,582 --> 00:24:16,095
I've read the Demon Law many times.

330
00:24:16,942 --> 00:24:18,342
I can even recite it from the back.

331
00:24:24,541 --> 00:24:26,974
I purposely begged Xuan Feng

332
00:24:27,325 --> 00:24:28,765
to make this sugar pastry in secret.

333
00:24:29,461 --> 00:24:31,254
Does it still taste the same?

334
00:24:43,701 --> 00:24:45,935
The power you lost a few days ago

335
00:24:46,102 --> 00:24:47,494
has almost been fully restored.

336
00:24:48,461 --> 00:24:49,621
It's time to take a bath now.

337
00:25:26,382 --> 00:25:27,382
Be careful.

338
00:25:29,902 --> 00:25:30,902
What's going on?

339
00:25:31,271 --> 00:25:32,880
Perhaps I'm a people person.

340
00:25:34,582 --> 00:25:35,791
I will pick you up

341
00:25:36,212 --> 00:25:38,292
to the Grand Aromatics Competition tomorrow morning.

342
00:25:49,142 --> 00:25:50,694
Wu Zhen, you are...

343
00:25:52,942 --> 00:25:55,615
I might not be able to join the fun tomorrow.

344
00:25:56,061 --> 00:25:58,301
I've been asked to become a judge.

345
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:02,454
Please don't be so harsh on me tomorrow, Wu Zhen.

346
00:26:14,142 --> 00:26:15,400
(Grand Aromatics Competition?)

347
00:26:44,622 --> 00:26:45,734
Today's judges

348
00:26:45,942 --> 00:26:47,575
are all aromatics experts.

349
00:26:47,902 --> 00:26:49,462
For example, Master Xie and Master Gao.

350
00:26:50,382 --> 00:26:51,422
However, you must remember

351
00:26:51,622 --> 00:26:52,974
to stay away from them.

352
00:26:54,061 --> 00:26:55,061
Why?

353
00:26:55,422 --> 00:26:56,981
You beat up Master Xie's second nephew

354
00:26:57,061 --> 00:26:58,935
and also Master Gao's youngest nephew.

355
00:27:01,822 --> 00:27:02,822
However,

356
00:27:03,342 --> 00:27:04,575
the greatest person

357
00:27:04,902 --> 00:27:07,095
is today's main judge,

358
00:27:07,301 --> 00:27:08,375
An Bi Luo.

359
00:27:13,942 --> 00:27:15,582
- Master An is here. - Everyone.

360
00:27:15,902 --> 00:27:17,454
Master An.

361
00:27:18,382 --> 00:27:19,415
That's An Bi Luo.

362
00:27:19,662 --> 00:27:21,342
- It has been so long. - Currently, no.

363
00:27:21,422 --> 00:27:23,703
He has been the greatest Fragrance Master of the century.

364
00:27:25,142 --> 00:27:26,381
Master.

365
00:27:26,468 --> 00:27:27,468
Vice Minister Wang.

366
00:27:27,662 --> 00:27:30,734
His judgment will mostly decide today's result.

367
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:32,615
I can almost see you drooling.

368
00:27:33,862 --> 00:27:34,862
He's here.

369
00:27:37,461 --> 00:27:39,974
This lady is...

370
00:27:41,221 --> 00:27:42,221
Master An.

371
00:27:42,342 --> 00:27:43,694
Lady Liu is sick.

372
00:27:43,862 --> 00:27:45,415
Regretfully, she is absent today.

373
00:27:45,774 --> 00:27:47,767
This is the Empress's sister.

374
00:27:47,858 --> 00:27:49,578
The second daughter of Duke Wu's Residence,

375
00:27:49,781 --> 00:27:50,781
Princess Qinghe.

376
00:27:52,422 --> 00:27:53,774
I see.

377
00:27:54,741 --> 00:27:56,335
Spare the formalities, Master An.

378
00:27:56,582 --> 00:27:58,615
Are you well-versed in fragrances too?

379
00:27:59,622 --> 00:28:00,622
I know a little.

380
00:28:02,798 --> 00:28:04,639
Talking about fragrances to you

381
00:28:04,708 --> 00:28:06,748
is similar to acting like a fool before the expert.

382
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:08,974
Anyone will be humble before you.

383
00:28:10,299 --> 00:28:12,299
Right, Your Highness?

384
00:28:13,021 --> 00:28:14,415
Your Highness, you are too humble.

385
00:28:17,182 --> 00:28:18,375
Is this

386
00:28:19,061 --> 00:28:21,494
Manager Ling Xiao from Yuzhen Parlour?

387
00:28:23,461 --> 00:28:24,494
You know me?

388
00:28:26,730 --> 00:28:28,798
The fragrances of Yuzhen Parlour are famous in Chang'an.

389
00:28:28,822 --> 00:28:30,734
I've heard about you.

390
00:28:31,422 --> 00:28:32,798
Princess Qinghe. Manager Ling Xiao.

391
00:28:32,822 --> 00:28:35,655
I'll be in your care

392
00:28:36,301 --> 00:28:37,861
in today's Grand Aromatics Competition.

393
00:28:38,021 --> 00:28:39,774
Not at all. You...

394
00:28:40,781 --> 00:28:41,781
You...

395
00:28:43,662 --> 00:28:45,734
Master An recognizes me.

396
00:28:46,061 --> 00:28:47,061
Master An...

397
00:28:47,541 --> 00:28:48,701
Ling Xiao,

398
00:28:48,781 --> 00:28:51,095
do you smell something weird?

399
00:28:52,822 --> 00:28:53,822
What is it?

400
00:28:55,182 --> 00:28:56,655
Smells like a brown-noser.

401
00:28:57,422 --> 00:28:58,422
What?

402
00:28:58,701 --> 00:28:59,701
Who has a brown nose?

403
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,135
It smells intense.

404
00:29:02,461 --> 00:29:03,655
Where's the brown-noser?

405
00:29:04,902 --> 00:29:06,534
Are you calling me a brown-noser?

406
00:29:07,422 --> 00:29:09,014
I admit it because he is Master An!

407
00:29:11,541 --> 00:29:13,534
The Grand Aromatics Competition

408
00:29:13,981 --> 00:29:16,815
four grades, namely Normal Grade, Competent Grade,

409
00:29:17,781 --> 00:29:20,335
Marvelous Grade, and Supreme Grade.

410
00:29:21,102 --> 00:29:22,494
According to the grades,

411
00:29:23,461 --> 00:29:26,974
the fragrances with the highest grade

412
00:29:27,061 --> 00:29:28,694
will enter the final round.

413
00:29:29,021 --> 00:29:32,855
Finally, the final winner will be chosen

414
00:29:33,182 --> 00:29:36,095
by the judges and everyone here.

415
00:29:36,902 --> 00:29:38,575
The reward for this year

416
00:29:38,804 --> 00:29:42,158
is the rare Kirin Horn Gum.

417
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:46,622
Miss Zhen?

418
00:29:47,422 --> 00:29:48,422
It's you?

419
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:50,534
Where's Lady Liu?

420
00:29:55,182 --> 00:29:58,014
Mr. Mei, do you even like these events?

421
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:01,974
I'm worried for you to be here

422
00:30:02,342 --> 00:30:04,062
so I asked Fourth Brother to bring me here.

423
00:30:13,142 --> 00:30:16,815
Master An Bi Luo will be the judge.

424
00:30:17,902 --> 00:30:19,534
Welcome, Master An.

425
00:30:58,541 --> 00:31:00,615
The Chang'an Grand Aromatics Competition

426
00:31:00,902 --> 00:31:01,935
begins now!

427
00:31:11,942 --> 00:31:15,381
I am the Fragrance Master of Qizhou's Jiuhe Parlour.

428
00:31:15,461 --> 00:31:17,502
I traveled abroad in recent years

429
00:31:17,582 --> 00:31:19,901
and found Moluo Kingdom's Agarwood.

430
00:31:19,981 --> 00:31:22,815
It is sealed with Suhe Oil for one hundred days

431
00:31:22,981 --> 00:31:24,815
to create Leyou Fragrance.

432
00:31:25,021 --> 00:31:26,855
Let me offer it to everyone.

433
00:31:27,182 --> 00:31:28,974
The recipe is simple

434
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:31,901
but what is so special about Agarwood?

435
00:31:31,999 --> 00:31:33,335
You are right, Master Gao.

436
00:31:33,541 --> 00:31:36,454
The fragrance is quite interesting in my opinion.

437
00:31:36,741 --> 00:31:39,534
I can smell jaggery from the Agarwood fragrance.

438
00:31:41,261 --> 00:31:43,254
You are...

439
00:31:46,102 --> 00:31:47,935
Pei Ji Ya from Kunzhou.

440
00:31:50,822 --> 00:31:52,054
It's him?

441
00:31:52,301 --> 00:31:53,301
I see.

442
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:55,941
The spices of the Pei family are famous.

443
00:31:56,021 --> 00:31:57,655
I've heard that Mr. Pei

444
00:31:57,822 --> 00:32:00,774
is also well-versed in fragrances.

445
00:32:01,781 --> 00:32:04,262
I believe no one dares object

446
00:32:04,342 --> 00:32:06,294
even if you are one of the judges.

447
00:32:12,582 --> 00:32:14,054
Try burning the fragrance first.

448
00:32:27,902 --> 00:32:31,175
There's a strange smell among the rich fragrance.

449
00:32:31,382 --> 00:32:32,382
It's the smell of blood.

450
00:32:44,402 --> 00:32:47,774
(Marvelous Grade)

451
00:32:57,793 --> 00:33:00,442
I don't smell any fragrance.

452
00:33:00,523 --> 00:33:02,085
(Normal Grade)

453
00:33:10,582 --> 00:33:12,815
An probably caught a cold

454
00:33:13,370 --> 00:33:14,607
and has a blocked nose.

455
00:33:14,741 --> 00:33:15,741
Nonsense.

456
00:33:16,342 --> 00:33:17,935
Master An has great taste.

457
00:33:18,221 --> 00:33:19,534
He is special.

458
00:33:27,662 --> 00:33:29,979
(Normal Grade)

459
00:33:34,902 --> 00:33:35,974
Princess Qinghe.

460
00:33:37,741 --> 00:33:41,454
Why are you only giving it a Normal Grade?

461
00:33:42,461 --> 00:33:44,621
I think the fragrance

462
00:33:44,701 --> 00:33:46,415
smells of blood.

463
00:33:47,662 --> 00:33:49,294
Blood?

464
00:33:50,701 --> 00:33:53,054
Your Highness, please explain yourself.

465
00:34:05,221 --> 00:34:06,461
This fragrance might be special

466
00:34:06,741 --> 00:34:08,335
but it is difficult to harvest.

467
00:34:08,702 --> 00:34:10,822
I heard the workers of the Moluo Kingdom

468
00:34:10,902 --> 00:34:12,262
risk their lives

469
00:34:12,342 --> 00:34:13,662
to climb the cliffs

470
00:34:13,742 --> 00:34:15,815
just to harvest the honey of Agarwood.

471
00:34:15,956 --> 00:34:18,710
It is harvested through blood and sweat.

472
00:34:19,249 --> 00:34:21,086
I'm sure Princess Qinghe thinks the same

473
00:34:21,181 --> 00:34:22,534
and sees it as unfitting

474
00:34:22,822 --> 00:34:24,054
of the Leyou Fragrance name.

475
00:34:25,302 --> 00:34:26,335
Young Master,

476
00:34:26,822 --> 00:34:28,255
you are knowledgeable.

477
00:35:06,004 --> 00:35:07,023
(Competent Grade)

478
00:35:08,129 --> 00:35:09,239
(Normal Grade)

479
00:35:11,655 --> 00:35:13,040
(Normal Grade)

480
00:35:28,878 --> 00:35:30,179
(Normal Grade)

481
00:35:49,942 --> 00:35:51,415
It's a battle of fragrances.

482
00:35:51,621 --> 00:35:53,654
Why is he trying to appeal to Miss Zhen?

483
00:35:58,141 --> 00:36:00,534
This is called Reminiscent Fragrance.

484
00:36:02,101 --> 00:36:03,335
Reminiscent Fragrance?

485
00:36:04,822 --> 00:36:05,822
This name

486
00:36:07,541 --> 00:36:09,295
must be simply created.

487
00:36:10,501 --> 00:36:12,494
I created this fragrance myself.

488
00:36:16,302 --> 00:36:17,302
Whatever.

489
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:21,000
Mr. Pei, go ahead.

490
00:38:15,661 --> 00:38:17,094
The Reminiscent Fragrance.
