00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,917
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:30,998 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 32)

3
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,246
Mr. Mei, I'm afraid you've read too many storybooks.

4
00:01:41,407 --> 00:01:43,280
People rarely part ways with one another

5
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:46,480
with reluctance.

6
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:49,260
If that's the case,

7
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:51,205
why were you avoiding me?

8
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,726
What exactly were you hiding from me?

9
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:04,966
What's wrong with you?

10
00:02:07,319 --> 00:02:08,846
I don't mean to hide from you.

11
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,760
It's because these matters

12
00:02:12,216 --> 00:02:13,783
are none of your business.

13
00:02:15,719 --> 00:02:17,119
You still won't tell me.

14
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:18,349
I won't.

15
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,085
You heard her.

16
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:27,245
She is not willing to say.

17
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:29,886
I'm not the one who causes your death.

18
00:02:30,159 --> 00:02:31,222
It's the Cat Lord.

19
00:02:34,872 --> 00:02:36,880
Mei Zhu Yu! This is too much!

20
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,560
If you tell me the truth,

21
00:02:42,646 --> 00:02:44,333
I will put him down immediately.

22
00:02:49,543 --> 00:02:51,880
I'm going to be burned!

23
00:02:56,840 --> 00:02:57,903
Fine!

24
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,805
I will tell you everything honestly.

25
00:03:17,719 --> 00:03:18,846
I told you before

26
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:20,805
that we were on different paths.

27
00:03:21,759 --> 00:03:23,046
I might be the lord of demons

28
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:25,846
but I became a demon as a human

29
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,846
so I can only be a half-demon.

30
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:32,423
Half-demon?

31
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,046
That's right. I am a half-demon.

32
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:38,765
I am a human by day

33
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:40,846
and a demon by night.

34
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:44,880
Mr. Mei. Are you done with work?

35
00:03:44,960 --> 00:03:46,286
I'm here to pick you up.

36
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:48,942
Stay away!

37
00:03:58,395 --> 00:03:59,463
No wonder.

38
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:01,085
For 18 years,

39
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,326
I've been despised by Demon City because of that.

40
00:04:06,919 --> 00:04:07,982
Right now,

41
00:04:10,039 --> 00:04:12,485
I want to abandon this half-demon skin

42
00:04:13,639 --> 00:04:15,245
and become a complete demon.

43
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,086
It takes a century to achieve that.

44
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,406
I need to cultivate in seclusion for 100 years.

45
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,046
When you come out of seclusion,

46
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:57,942
I believe

47
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,925
I will be dead.

48
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:09,303
Yes.

49
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:15,046
Is this how you are punishing me

50
00:05:17,279 --> 00:05:19,286
for disappointing you?

51
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:32,766
I had a meal with you

52
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:35,805
and I gave you an answer.

53
00:05:38,879 --> 00:05:41,086
Can you not disturb me anymore?

54
00:06:58,319 --> 00:06:59,766
Bring me back to Demon City immediately.

55
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,365
Why are there so many demonic ulcers?

56
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:10,805
The three of you should go out.

57
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,206
She's so heavily injured.

58
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:38,766
I have to take a gamble.

59
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,726
Where do you find a demon core? What are you doing?

60
00:08:02,920 --> 00:08:03,983
Zhen,

61
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:06,565
Your body has been hurt by the Life Transforming Art

62
00:08:06,839 --> 00:08:08,086
and it can't hold on for much longer.

63
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:09,966
You can only survive

64
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:11,726
by a complete demon's spell.

65
00:08:12,519 --> 00:08:13,582
Zhen,

66
00:08:13,839 --> 00:08:14,902
don't blame me.

67
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:16,606
No matter what happens after this

68
00:08:16,959 --> 00:08:18,805
and what happens around the world,

69
00:08:19,399 --> 00:08:21,766
I will always protect you by your side.

70
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:26,223
Shu.

71
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:29,286
Stop.

72
00:08:33,960 --> 00:08:35,023
Shu!

73
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:03,565
The Sinister Fiend Core?

74
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,605
(No. She still can't become a complete demon in her condition.)

75
00:09:20,120 --> 00:09:21,183
Seriously.

76
00:09:21,879 --> 00:09:23,845
Why am I involved in an argument between a married couple?

77
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:26,085
Both of you have a bad relationship

78
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:28,046
but I was the one who got scared.

79
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:29,543
Seriously.

80
00:09:30,919 --> 00:09:31,982
Help me.

81
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:34,366
Again?

82
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:45,783
That's not right.

83
00:09:55,679 --> 00:09:56,742
What's going on?

84
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:00,006
Why is there a sinister aura?

85
00:10:09,679 --> 00:10:11,702
Stop! Shu!

86
00:10:18,799 --> 00:10:19,862
Shu!

87
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:21,565
Shu, stop.

88
00:10:23,039 --> 00:10:25,920
Let me out.

89
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:27,063
Shu!

90
00:10:28,559 --> 00:10:29,845
Shu, stop!

91
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:34,925
Let me out!

92
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:40,046
Let me out!

93
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:43,423
Gosh.

94
00:10:43,840 --> 00:10:44,903
What's going on?

95
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:47,679
Mr. Mei, why are you here?

96
00:10:47,759 --> 00:10:48,822
My Lord!

97
00:10:50,559 --> 00:10:51,799
He threatened me.

98
00:10:51,879 --> 00:10:53,679
He threatened me twice in a day.

99
00:10:53,759 --> 00:10:54,822
What is happening?

100
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,766
Wu Zi Shu is treating Boss.

101
00:10:57,080 --> 00:10:58,286
Right now, it seems like

102
00:10:58,720 --> 00:10:59,965
something has gone wrong.

103
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:20,543
- Kitty!   - Boss!

104
00:11:20,879 --> 00:11:23,805
Wu Zi Shu, stop! You will kill her!

105
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:27,543
Wu Zhen!

106
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:29,479
- Kitty!   - Wu Zhen!

107
00:11:29,559 --> 00:11:30,766
- No!   - Wu Zhen!

108
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:32,241
- No!   - Wu Zhen, wake up!

109
00:11:32,321 --> 00:11:33,439
Don't control me! Stop!

110
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:34,582
Wu Zhen!

111
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,839
Zhen!

112
00:11:38,919 --> 00:11:40,503
- Wu Zhen!   - Stop!

113
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:42,462
Wu Zhen.

114
00:11:57,120 --> 00:12:00,006
She almost died because of you just now!

115
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,366
I was trying to save her!

116
00:12:01,511 --> 00:12:03,480
You transferred demonic energy to the Sinister Fiend Core.

117
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:06,406
Were you trying to save her or harm her?

118
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:08,383
Not only will you

119
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,366
not let her recover in any way by doing that,

120
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:12,568
but you are also increasing the Sinister Fiend's power.

121
00:12:13,559 --> 00:12:14,622
This is impossible!

122
00:12:14,840 --> 00:12:15,903
No wonder.

123
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:18,685
We couldn't break the Undecaying Bone.

124
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:20,526
The more we attacked it with demonic energy,

125
00:12:20,879 --> 00:12:22,286
the more we were helping it grow.

126
00:12:23,600 --> 00:12:25,199
So, what Mr. Mei said

127
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:26,886
must be right somehow.

128
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:31,679
For 18 years,

129
00:12:31,759 --> 00:12:33,280
I've done everything I can for Zhen.

130
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:34,725
What have all of you done?

131
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:36,965
Even if I made a mistake,

132
00:12:37,159 --> 00:12:38,965
who are you to criticize me?

133
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:40,685
If you release the Sinister Fiend,

134
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:42,845
not only will you put her life in danger,

135
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:44,366
but the whole Demon City

136
00:12:44,759 --> 00:12:46,526
and the mortal realm will be destroyed.

137
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:47,903
Mei Zhu Yu.

138
00:12:48,159 --> 00:12:50,160
You are indeed someone from Changxi Palace.

139
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:52,565
You are still acting righteous when life and death are concerned.

140
00:12:52,960 --> 00:12:54,126
However, you don't know

141
00:12:54,639 --> 00:12:56,526
that Zhen will die

142
00:12:57,120 --> 00:12:58,725
if she doesn't try using this method.

143
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,445
That's right. Kitty's body is near its end.

144
00:13:07,432 --> 00:13:09,597
She is forced to cultivate in seclusion

145
00:13:10,173 --> 00:13:11,939
and become a complete demon.

146
00:13:12,039 --> 00:13:13,486
She wasn't trying to anger on purpose.

147
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:19,462
Mei Zhu Yu.

148
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,565
This is what it means to be on different paths.

149
00:13:22,159 --> 00:13:23,725
You and Zhen

150
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,526
are not on the same path after all.

151
00:13:38,759 --> 00:13:40,622
- Boss!   - Kitty!

152
00:13:46,399 --> 00:13:48,925
Is she returning to the Mortal Realm?

153
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,805
The Sinister Fiend almost escaped just now.

154
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:52,599
I think she probably suffered a shock.

155
00:13:52,679 --> 00:13:53,742
I'll go and look for her.

156
00:14:05,799 --> 00:14:06,862
Mr. Mei.

157
00:14:07,600 --> 00:14:09,085
You are wise.

158
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:11,685
I'm sure you know what this means.

159
00:14:16,559 --> 00:14:18,205
You know clearly

160
00:14:18,679 --> 00:14:20,246
that although the core in Kitty

161
00:14:20,799 --> 00:14:22,845
is sealed by the Cat Lord's power,

162
00:14:23,679 --> 00:14:25,486
if there's an accident,

163
00:14:26,080 --> 00:14:27,646
what happened tonight will happen again.

164
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:30,445
Either Kitty's body will be possessed

165
00:14:31,159 --> 00:14:33,006
or the Sinister Fiend will escape.

166
00:14:34,679 --> 00:14:35,742
So,

167
00:14:36,679 --> 00:14:37,959
if you want

168
00:14:38,039 --> 00:14:39,646
to get rid of your enemy forever,

169
00:14:40,519 --> 00:14:42,006
there's only one way right now.

170
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:45,364
Kill her.

171
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,023
That's right.

172
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,366
When the Sinister Fiend Core is still in her body,

173
00:14:52,799 --> 00:14:55,685
her body will be the Sinister Fiend's cage.

174
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,286
If you want revenge,

175
00:14:59,240 --> 00:15:00,805
now is the best time.

176
00:15:02,200 --> 00:15:03,263
The sun is coming out.

177
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:05,126
I'm going to look for my wife.

178
00:15:09,336 --> 00:15:10,423
Serpent Lord,

179
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:12,565
why did you tell Mr. Mei that?

180
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,845
Are you not afraid that he might hurt Boss?

181
00:15:16,559 --> 00:15:17,622
No.

182
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:19,965
He won't hurt Kitty.

183
00:15:33,919 --> 00:15:34,982
There's a thief.

184
00:15:58,960 --> 00:16:00,023
Commissioner Mei?

185
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:01,903
What are you doing?

186
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,423
I'm looking for a cat.

187
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,702
It's the wrong cat.

188
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:13,143
Let's go.

189
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:22,360
Which cat is Commissioner Mei looking for?

190
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:23,503
He is mobilizing everyone.

191
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,263
I don't know.

192
00:16:25,840 --> 00:16:27,166
Commissioner Mei

193
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:28,965
always has a reason for doing things.

194
00:16:55,879 --> 00:16:56,942
Dear.

195
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:08,862
Dear.

196
00:17:12,079 --> 00:17:13,142
Wu Zhen.

197
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:17,446
Don't be angry.

198
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:21,256
Previously, I thought you wanted to become a complete demon

199
00:17:21,332 --> 00:17:23,210
because you were angry at me and didn't want to see me.

200
00:17:26,119 --> 00:17:27,565
I was too narrow-minded.

201
00:17:28,130 --> 00:17:29,842
I didn't realize how difficult it was for you.

202
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:57,400
It's you again?

203
00:17:57,480 --> 00:17:58,679
I won't let you do it three times.

204
00:17:58,759 --> 00:18:00,405
If you capture me again, I'll get angry.

205
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:09,165
I'm not here to capture you.

206
00:18:10,039 --> 00:18:11,102
I'm here to look for it.

207
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,223
Is this the Cat Lord?

208
00:18:19,279 --> 00:18:20,342
No.

209
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,405
It looks like her.

210
00:18:28,839 --> 00:18:29,902
It's a male.

211
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,463
A male?

212
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:02,405
Please take it away immediately.

213
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:04,125
My young master hates cats a lot.

214
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:08,966
It seems like the cat will be sad then.

215
00:19:25,640 --> 00:19:26,845
Can you not get down?

216
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,125
It has always been you?

217
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,726
Come home with me,

218
00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:11,743
Dear.

219
00:20:13,920 --> 00:20:15,286
No matter what happens,

220
00:20:17,640 --> 00:20:19,286
I will overcome it with you.

221
00:20:21,799 --> 00:20:22,862
Trust me.

222
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,862
Dear,

223
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:39,966
can you not be angry with me?

224
00:20:58,519 --> 00:21:00,565
Dear, drink some.

225
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:02,805
This water absorbs sinister aura.

226
00:21:03,720 --> 00:21:04,783
Here.

227
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:14,102
Drink slowly.

228
00:22:13,759 --> 00:22:14,822
You're awake?

229
00:22:16,319 --> 00:22:18,246
Why don't you get changed when you turn back?

230
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,342
I'll go and get it for you.

231
00:22:24,359 --> 00:22:25,446
Come home with me,

232
00:22:26,519 --> 00:22:27,582
Dear.

233
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:30,286
Where is this?

234
00:22:32,480 --> 00:22:34,006
Is this our home?

235
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:04,263
She lost her memory?

236
00:23:06,839 --> 00:23:08,640
The core in her body and demonic ulcers

237
00:23:08,720 --> 00:23:09,885
have been suppressed

238
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:11,805
but her foundation has been damaged.

239
00:23:12,319 --> 00:23:15,526
I think losing her memory is one of the symptoms.

240
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:21,125
What do you plan to do now, Mr. Mei?

241
00:23:21,193 --> 00:23:22,955
There are many kinds of elixirs, medicines,

242
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:25,845
and spells in this world.

243
00:23:26,319 --> 00:23:27,845
I won't let something happen to her again.

244
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:31,926
It seems like you've made your decision.

245
00:23:38,119 --> 00:23:40,182
- Miss Zhen.   - Kitty?

246
00:23:41,920 --> 00:23:43,165
Who are they?

247
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:46,783
Friends.

248
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,125
The peach is delicious. Try it.

249
00:23:55,047 --> 00:23:56,653
Didn't Miss Zhen lose her memory?

250
00:23:56,759 --> 00:23:58,165
You're still running on rooftops?

251
00:23:58,359 --> 00:24:00,286
Who stole my peaches?

252
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:01,726
You even stole the peaches?

253
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:03,246
I'm sure it was Miss Zhen.

254
00:24:08,322 --> 00:24:09,449
Since both of you are my friends,

255
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,223
have some peaches.

256
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:13,845
Sorry!

257
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:17,605
Your Highness, can you stop going into other people's houses?

258
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,279
Also, you shouldn't

259
00:24:19,359 --> 00:24:21,246
catch birds and chickens everywhere.

260
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:24,885
You caused trouble for all our neighbors this morning.

261
00:24:25,359 --> 00:24:27,645
I almost used up all my money to pay for the damage you caused.

262
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:29,605
Your Highness?

263
00:24:30,200 --> 00:24:31,365
Call me Dear.

264
00:24:36,160 --> 00:24:37,565
Little Fish.

265
00:24:38,759 --> 00:24:40,039
How amazing.

266
00:24:40,119 --> 00:24:41,519
Miss Zhen doesn't remember anything

267
00:24:41,599 --> 00:24:42,845
except for you.

268
00:24:43,640 --> 00:24:44,885
Didn't you divorce...

269
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:52,125
Your dress is dirty. You should wash it.

270
00:24:55,880 --> 00:24:57,199
Look at our peach tree!

271
00:24:57,279 --> 00:24:58,439
Look what it has become!

272
00:24:58,519 --> 00:24:59,845
Why isn't anyone here yet?

273
00:24:59,960 --> 00:25:01,565
Madam Li, sorry!

274
00:25:05,519 --> 00:25:07,325
In Miss Zhen's condition,

275
00:25:07,480 --> 00:25:09,286
will everyone think that both of you have reconciled?

276
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:11,503
Yes.

277
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:14,046
When Father-in-law found out she was coming back,

278
00:25:15,160 --> 00:25:16,486
he was so happy.

279
00:25:19,880 --> 00:25:21,199
When will

280
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:22,486
Miss Zhen recover though?

281
00:26:21,599 --> 00:26:24,605
Mr. Mei, your heart is beating quickly.

282
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:32,885
Look. My heart is also beating quickly.

283
00:26:37,119 --> 00:26:39,206
I will sleep in my study tonight.

284
00:26:39,519 --> 00:26:40,582
Why?

285
00:26:41,119 --> 00:26:43,645
Shouldn't you sleep with your wife?

286
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,845
Why aren't you sleeping with me?

287
00:26:47,119 --> 00:26:48,565
I still have things to do.

288
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,805
Rest well.

289
00:27:38,400 --> 00:27:39,463
Zhen,

290
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:42,023
let's go home.

291
00:28:41,119 --> 00:28:42,182
Mei Zhu Yu.

292
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:44,686
She left you.

293
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:46,360
How can you hide her here

294
00:28:46,440 --> 00:28:47,805
when she has lost her memory?

295
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:50,125
Don't you think it's shameless?

296
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:51,926
It's shameless, so what?

297
00:28:53,759 --> 00:28:55,286
If you can't help her,

298
00:28:55,559 --> 00:28:57,365
I can't let you take her away.

299
00:28:57,519 --> 00:28:58,582
After all,

300
00:28:58,839 --> 00:29:00,439
you almost killed her.

301
00:29:00,519 --> 00:29:01,645
Me?

302
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:04,885
That was just an accident.

303
00:29:05,319 --> 00:29:06,645
You are a Celestial Master

304
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:10,325
who is obsessed with killing the Sinister Fiend Infant.

305
00:29:10,920 --> 00:29:12,046
Which of us

306
00:29:12,960 --> 00:29:14,565
is actually more dangerous?

307
00:29:15,279 --> 00:29:16,605
If her memory returns,

308
00:29:17,640 --> 00:29:19,325
how do you think she will treat you?

309
00:29:20,119 --> 00:29:22,686
Who do you think she will choose?

310
00:29:23,599 --> 00:29:25,006
When her memory returns,

311
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:26,885
she might blame me

312
00:29:27,960 --> 00:29:29,565
but she will never choose you.

313
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:31,303
You know this

314
00:29:31,519 --> 00:29:32,766
very well.

315
00:29:34,359 --> 00:29:35,565
Nonsense.

316
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:43,766
What are you two doing?

317
00:29:48,279 --> 00:29:49,342
Did we wake you up?

318
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:52,645
Who is he, Mr. Mei?

319
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,165
Mei Zhu Yu, you lied to her?

320
00:29:57,559 --> 00:29:59,206
It is written clearly in the marriage agreement.

321
00:29:59,559 --> 00:30:00,686
How am I lying to her?

322
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:04,543
Zhen,

323
00:30:05,440 --> 00:30:06,565
do you still remember me?

324
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:09,645
I don't know you.

325
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:14,182
Zhen,

326
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:16,645
I've been by your side for 18 years.

327
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:20,519
Do you not remember at all?

328
00:30:20,599 --> 00:30:22,085
I don't know you.

329
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:27,783
Zhen,

330
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:29,845
look closely.

331
00:30:31,599 --> 00:30:34,766
I'm the person who won't hurt you in this world.

332
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,605
You must be mistaken.

333
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:44,640
I am trying to rest. You should leave.

334
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:45,783
Zhen.

335
00:30:51,640 --> 00:30:52,703
Zhen.

336
00:31:07,075 --> 00:31:08,138
You trust me so much.

337
00:31:09,117 --> 00:31:10,829
Are you not afraid that I might be lying to you?

338
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:12,862
No.

339
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:15,223
Why?

340
00:31:15,319 --> 00:31:16,726
You are handsome.

341
00:31:19,920 --> 00:31:21,526
I'll leave Chang'an with you tomorrow.

342
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,286
We'll go on a trip. What do you think?

343
00:31:24,519 --> 00:31:25,582
Sure.

344
00:31:33,475 --> 00:31:38,106
(Chang'an)

345
00:31:43,319 --> 00:31:46,439
I won't object to going to Quzhou to look for medicine

346
00:31:46,519 --> 00:31:49,046
but I have to tell you a few things.

347
00:31:49,960 --> 00:31:52,526
Mr. Mei, I think you know there's no turning back after this.

348
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:53,885
When she recovers,

349
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:57,206
I hope you stop delaying her

350
00:31:58,319 --> 00:32:00,885
and make Kitty miss the Mortal Realm more.

351
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,365
After all, her life is more at risk

352
00:32:04,079 --> 00:32:06,885
with every day wasted.

353
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,645
I hope she can live well.

354
00:32:16,039 --> 00:32:17,206
As long as she's alive,

355
00:32:18,559 --> 00:32:20,286
I can endure it

356
00:32:21,125 --> 00:32:22,526
even if we don't meet each other again.

357
00:32:25,759 --> 00:32:27,286
Having you treat her sincerely

358
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,766
in her experience as a mortal is worth it.

359
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:34,046
I hope everything goes well for both of you.

360
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,006
They left without worries

361
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:18,560
but I had to spend so much time

362
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:20,206
talking with Mr. Wu at Duke Wu's Residence.

363
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:22,325
It's because you are capable.

364
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:24,845
After all, no one is better than you

365
00:33:26,279 --> 00:33:28,006
when it comes to deceiving someone.

366
00:33:32,640 --> 00:33:33,885
Are you done?

367
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:35,565
Don't move, Lady Liu.

368
00:33:37,279 --> 00:33:38,885
This is it.

369
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:42,165
It's lacking a bit of essence.

370
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:46,645
If she looks fiercer in your drawing, you'll capture her essence.

371
00:33:50,599 --> 00:33:51,662
Not bad.

372
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:54,885
Must you appear so suddenly?

373
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,845
Your door is locked. I can't come in through the window after all.

374
00:34:00,160 --> 00:34:01,223
What is it?

375
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:05,862
My Lord,

376
00:34:06,319 --> 00:34:07,805
you should return to Demon City.

377
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:09,132
That person is causing trouble again.

378
00:34:11,519 --> 00:34:12,559
Let's go.

379
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,702
Lady Liu.

380
00:34:14,079 --> 00:34:15,142
Where are you going?

381
00:34:15,639 --> 00:34:16,702
Back to Demon City.

382
00:34:17,199 --> 00:34:18,320
When are you coming back?

383
00:34:18,400 --> 00:34:19,605
Next time.

384
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:31,326
What do you think happened in Demon City?

385
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:36,806
It's none of my business.

386
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:39,119
Lord Xuan Hui,

387
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,479
why don't you help them out?

388
00:34:40,559 --> 00:34:41,622
No.

389
00:34:42,199 --> 00:34:43,645
I have a grudge against Demon City.

390
00:34:44,000 --> 00:34:45,165
You want me to help them?

391
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:46,423
Dream on.

392
00:34:46,840 --> 00:34:48,446
You are not helping Demon City.

393
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:51,966
You are helping your savior's future wife.

394
00:34:52,800 --> 00:34:55,006
You are being overconfident.

395
00:34:55,480 --> 00:34:57,280
You just picked me up at most.

396
00:34:57,360 --> 00:34:59,285
I won't die even if you had left me alone.

397
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:01,446
Mr. Xuan Hui.

398
00:35:02,599 --> 00:35:04,165
I might live better than I do now.

399
00:35:05,199 --> 00:35:06,200
I'm not going.

400
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:07,725
There's no use flattering me anymore.

401
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,125
Must she look fiercer in my drawing?

402
00:35:30,565 --> 00:35:31,639
Wu Zi Shu.

403
00:35:31,719 --> 00:35:32,782
Wu Zi Shu!

404
00:35:34,760 --> 00:35:36,245
What are you doing?

405
00:35:36,559 --> 00:35:37,622
Isn't it obvious?

406
00:35:37,840 --> 00:35:38,959
We are stopping you.

407
00:35:39,039 --> 00:35:40,102
Yes.

408
00:35:41,320 --> 00:35:42,383
Wu Zi Shu!

409
00:35:50,039 --> 00:35:51,102
Wu Zi Shu!

410
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,165
How dare you!

411
00:35:57,679 --> 00:35:58,742
Serpent Lord.

412
00:36:06,519 --> 00:36:08,125
You still recognize me?

413
00:36:09,111 --> 00:36:11,038
I thought you were muddled

414
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:14,645
to the point that you are disregarding me, the Serpent Lord.

415
00:36:16,920 --> 00:36:18,205
You must be joking, Serpent Lord.

416
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:21,605
However, I don't understand

417
00:36:21,880 --> 00:36:23,366
why have trapped me in Demon City

418
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,846
in recent days.

419
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:27,886
Why don't you understand?

420
00:36:29,039 --> 00:36:30,645
You have an obsession

421
00:36:31,079 --> 00:36:33,125
and this is an important moment for Kitty.

422
00:36:33,760 --> 00:36:35,519
If I trust that Mei Zhu Yu can save her,

423
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:37,006
I'll trust him until the end.

424
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:39,406
So, I have to stop you from meeting them.

425
00:36:40,159 --> 00:36:41,222
You trust him?

426
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:43,760
How can Mei Zhu Yu save her?

427
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:45,886
How can you save her?

428
00:36:51,519 --> 00:36:52,582
Enough.

429
00:36:53,119 --> 00:36:54,205
In that case,

430
00:36:54,719 --> 00:36:57,320
you should stay in Demon City,

431
00:36:57,400 --> 00:36:58,725
Lord Shu.

432
00:37:21,840 --> 00:37:24,085
No wonder that book is so restless.

433
00:37:24,360 --> 00:37:26,085
He seemed like he intended to break me.

434
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,439
How are all of you fine

435
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:29,840
with letting Mr. Mei bring Cat Lord

436
00:37:29,920 --> 00:37:31,966
to find a divine herb that might not even exist?

437
00:37:32,211 --> 00:37:34,418
There are real records of Zhuyu Divine Herb.

438
00:37:34,639 --> 00:37:36,366
It can treat various poisons and illnesses.

439
00:37:36,559 --> 00:37:37,840
It exists.

440
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:39,599
You believe in legends?

441
00:37:39,679 --> 00:37:40,880
We are the same, after all

442
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:42,605
but I've never even heard of it.

443
00:37:43,079 --> 00:37:44,280
Perhaps you are ignorant.

444
00:37:44,360 --> 00:37:45,423
You...

445
00:37:48,400 --> 00:37:51,165
Besides, Changxi Palace has many scriptures and manuals

446
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:52,886
in Quzhou.

447
00:37:53,599 --> 00:37:55,046
There might be a way.

448
00:37:57,039 --> 00:38:00,326
Whatever. Whether it's true or not,

449
00:38:00,639 --> 00:38:01,966
having hope is good enough.

450
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,023
No matter what,

451
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,406
we need something to look forward to.

452
00:38:21,639 --> 00:38:22,702
Dear.

453
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:28,182
Come.

454
00:38:33,880 --> 00:38:35,360
There isn't an inn

455
00:38:35,451 --> 00:38:36,503
or residents around here.

456
00:38:36,639 --> 00:38:38,526
Why don't we make do with this place for tonight?

457
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:41,486
It's all right. I'll be with you wherever you are.

458
00:39:12,239 --> 00:39:13,360
This place is too wet.

459
00:39:13,440 --> 00:39:15,526
I'm putting a layer of dry grass so you don't catch a cold.

460
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:33,486
That's weird. Why is the broom on the table?

461
00:39:39,152 --> 00:39:40,215
Here you go.

462
00:40:05,920 --> 00:40:07,280
Watch out!
