00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:31,000
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,059
(Episode 19)

3
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:41,786
Mr. Mei, I thought you didn't drink.

4
00:01:42,615 --> 00:01:44,360
You seem like you can hold your liquor pretty well.

5
00:01:45,808 --> 00:01:48,520
But you're wasting the liquor if you're drinking it as such.

6
00:01:49,677 --> 00:01:51,640
You have to savor Apricot Gold slowly

7
00:01:51,903 --> 00:01:54,010
to enjoy its taste.

8
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:56,840
And, it has a strong kick.

9
00:01:57,023 --> 00:02:00,609
I'm afraid you're drinking too much.

10
00:02:00,792 --> 00:02:02,880
I thought you already sent your cousin to his room.

11
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:04,584
What are you doing here again?

12
00:02:20,632 --> 00:02:22,098
Are you really drunk?

13
00:03:36,232 --> 00:03:37,232
What's wrong?

14
00:03:44,151 --> 00:03:45,978
Do you not recognize me?

15
00:03:48,111 --> 00:03:49,111
You...

16
00:03:54,752 --> 00:03:56,018
You are a fruit.

17
00:03:57,391 --> 00:03:58,497
What fruit?

18
00:04:01,752 --> 00:04:03,298
You are a fruit

19
00:04:04,312 --> 00:04:07,138
that fell from the tree of my residence.

20
00:04:20,391 --> 00:04:22,217
This is the tree of my residence.

21
00:04:23,351 --> 00:04:25,297
Let's go. Let the fruit send you back to your room.

22
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:30,578
You must stay away from Mr. Pei.

23
00:04:31,471 --> 00:04:32,471
He is

24
00:04:33,351 --> 00:04:34,351
bad.

25
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:35,911
Fine.

26
00:04:36,591 --> 00:04:39,097
Mr. Mei is the best. Let's go.

27
00:05:19,271 --> 00:05:21,457
You keep coming at me in such ways.

28
00:05:27,791 --> 00:05:28,864
Are you framing me

29
00:05:28,952 --> 00:05:31,018
because you are drunk?

30
00:05:44,192 --> 00:05:45,818
I can't carry you at all.

31
00:05:46,591 --> 00:05:47,591
Let me lie on you.

32
00:05:54,992 --> 00:05:58,258
(I wonder what you are thinking about.)

33
00:06:29,872 --> 00:06:30,872
Anyone there?

34
00:06:36,672 --> 00:06:37,672
Anyone there?

35
00:06:38,552 --> 00:06:39,585
Anyone there?

36
00:06:51,872 --> 00:06:53,720
(Why is he here at this time?)

37
00:07:00,872 --> 00:07:01,872
Lady Liu.

38
00:07:02,952 --> 00:07:03,952
Lady Liu.

39
00:07:06,072 --> 00:07:07,072
Lady Liu,

40
00:07:07,672 --> 00:07:08,777
I finally found you.

41
00:07:33,992 --> 00:07:34,992
Lady Liu.

42
00:07:35,552 --> 00:07:37,297
If you are in trouble,

43
00:07:37,911 --> 00:07:38,911
tell me.

44
00:07:41,391 --> 00:07:42,391
Go away.

45
00:07:46,031 --> 00:07:48,938
Monster! Stop disturbing Lady Liu!

46
00:08:57,511 --> 00:09:00,417
She seduced me. She's going to harm me! She's a scary demon!

47
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:05,218
She's a demon!

48
00:09:10,231 --> 00:09:11,231
Lady Liu!

49
00:09:13,511 --> 00:09:14,511
Lady Liu!

50
00:09:31,392 --> 00:09:33,618
Lady Liu, are you all right?

51
00:09:35,272 --> 00:09:36,498
Why did you come back?

52
00:09:36,952 --> 00:09:38,258
The "Compendium of Demons" says

53
00:09:38,552 --> 00:09:39,858
when a Serpent Demon is shedding,

54
00:09:39,952 --> 00:09:42,338
it needs to drink water and not eat.

55
00:09:42,912 --> 00:09:44,177
I also remember

56
00:09:44,272 --> 00:09:46,218
that when a Serpent Demon is weak,

57
00:09:46,511 --> 00:09:49,378
it needs Aloe Vera, Chinese Box, and mulberry trees

58
00:09:49,751 --> 00:09:51,697
so I plucked some fresh mulberry leaves.

59
00:09:52,471 --> 00:09:54,937
I don't know which kind is the most effective

60
00:09:55,111 --> 00:09:56,417
so I prepared every kind.

61
00:10:56,272 --> 00:10:57,858
How did I come back?

62
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:09,687
Ji Ya, I'll let you try the flatbread in the Western parts of the city.

63
00:11:25,751 --> 00:11:26,791
Princess Qinghe and Mr. Pei

64
00:11:26,871 --> 00:11:30,817
have been together for the last two days.

65
00:11:32,063 --> 00:11:33,648
They are walking on the streets

66
00:11:33,912 --> 00:11:36,697
and going around places when everyone is watching.

67
00:11:37,552 --> 00:11:38,897
Everyone in Chang'an is saying

68
00:11:39,272 --> 00:11:41,417
that both of them are engaged.

69
00:11:41,991 --> 00:11:42,991
Is this true?

70
00:11:44,631 --> 00:11:47,192
I don't know.

71
00:11:48,633 --> 00:11:49,880
Brother Mei,

72
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:53,186
is it really over between you and Princess Qinghe?

73
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,458
Where is the thing I want?

74
00:12:04,432 --> 00:12:05,432
I got it.

75
00:12:05,631 --> 00:12:06,897
This is what you asked for.

76
00:12:08,072 --> 00:12:09,072
Minister Liu said

77
00:12:09,552 --> 00:12:10,952
these were all the records of evil spells

78
00:12:11,032 --> 00:12:12,498
found in the Archives Pavilion.

79
00:12:14,831 --> 00:12:17,858
Brother Nie Li, please help me thank Minister Liu.

80
00:12:20,831 --> 00:12:21,831
Brother Mei,

81
00:12:22,272 --> 00:12:23,712
you can't be

82
00:12:23,792 --> 00:12:25,297
protecting the princess every day.

83
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:27,858
If you care about her,

84
00:12:28,312 --> 00:12:29,385
you should take the initiative.

85
00:12:29,451 --> 00:12:31,245
I'm not afraid that she has fallen for someone else.

86
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:33,552
I'm just afraid

87
00:12:35,272 --> 00:12:36,937
that she has fallen for a bad person.

88
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,138
Is something wrong, Wu Zhen?

89
00:13:08,871 --> 00:13:10,098
People are always talking about us

90
00:13:10,231 --> 00:13:12,098
when we come out.

91
00:13:12,392 --> 00:13:13,392
It spoils my mood.

92
00:13:15,111 --> 00:13:17,218
You are famous in Chang'an.

93
00:13:17,552 --> 00:13:18,625
It's unavoidable.

94
00:13:18,991 --> 00:13:19,991
Don't be angry.

95
00:13:20,272 --> 00:13:21,817
You mean I'm infamous.

96
00:13:23,432 --> 00:13:24,777
Why should I buy rouge?

97
00:13:24,991 --> 00:13:25,991
I'm not going.

98
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,137
All right. Let's not go then.

99
00:13:31,631 --> 00:13:34,817
Should we go to the outskirts a few days later?

100
00:13:35,192 --> 00:13:37,697
It won't be as troublesome as the city.

101
00:13:41,111 --> 00:13:44,057
Ji Ya, why don't we go to Lin'an River?

102
00:13:45,272 --> 00:13:46,272
Lin'an River?

103
00:13:48,591 --> 00:13:51,177
The largest river outside of Chang'an.

104
00:13:51,912 --> 00:13:54,177
Opposite the river, there's also an island.

105
00:13:55,231 --> 00:13:57,577
I heard the scenery there was pretty in early autumn.

106
00:13:57,991 --> 00:14:00,297
We'll both take a boat when the time comes.

107
00:14:00,631 --> 00:14:02,057
We'll travel with the flow

108
00:14:02,511 --> 00:14:03,697
and float freely.

109
00:14:04,591 --> 00:14:05,591
What do you think?

110
00:14:05,711 --> 00:14:06,711
Sure.

111
00:14:07,032 --> 00:14:09,218
I agree with everything you say.

112
00:14:11,831 --> 00:14:13,992
- Again!   - Great!

113
00:14:14,072 --> 00:14:15,072
Again!

114
00:14:19,392 --> 00:14:20,392
Make way.

115
00:14:23,392 --> 00:14:26,138
Will the boss return to Demon City tonight?

116
00:14:26,631 --> 00:14:27,738
Why not?

117
00:14:27,831 --> 00:14:29,258
The boss has been busy recently.

118
00:14:30,111 --> 00:14:31,738
She's with Mr. Pei.

119
00:14:32,032 --> 00:14:34,057
They have been going out together every day.

120
00:14:34,471 --> 00:14:35,791
Everyone in Chang'an says

121
00:14:35,871 --> 00:14:38,313
she and Mr. Pei are childhood friends and a match made in heaven.

122
00:14:38,393 --> 00:14:40,697
Mr. Pei is very happy to hear those rumors.

123
00:14:42,231 --> 00:14:43,618
Childhood friends?

124
00:14:44,622 --> 00:14:46,729
The person who has been with Zhen for 18 years

125
00:14:47,312 --> 00:14:48,817
isn't Pei Ji Ya.

126
00:14:58,672 --> 00:15:00,458
Come back.

127
00:15:01,032 --> 00:15:03,577
Come back to my side.

128
00:15:05,032 --> 00:15:09,817
We will achieve our ambitions together.

129
00:15:11,751 --> 00:15:12,751
Get lost!

130
00:15:13,032 --> 00:15:14,032
Shu?

131
00:15:15,032 --> 00:15:16,032
Zhen.

132
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:24,618
Were you talking to me?

133
00:15:25,432 --> 00:15:28,018
No. I wouldn't get angry at you.

134
00:15:28,711 --> 00:15:30,297
I just had a nightmare.

135
00:15:32,552 --> 00:15:34,472
Shu, if you are in trouble,

136
00:15:34,552 --> 00:15:35,952
you must tell us.

137
00:15:36,032 --> 00:15:37,537
We will think of a solution together.

138
00:15:38,519 --> 00:15:41,231
Don't worry. I'm only second to you in Demon City.

139
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,720
Nothing will happen to me.

140
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:45,866
Besides, if something does happen, I will tell you.

141
00:15:46,751 --> 00:15:47,751
The others

142
00:15:48,192 --> 00:15:49,338
are not important.

143
00:15:58,672 --> 00:15:59,672
Here you go.

144
00:16:00,152 --> 00:16:02,937
Everything about Xuan Hui is here.

145
00:16:11,672 --> 00:16:12,672
What is it?

146
00:16:14,552 --> 00:16:18,978
There's one thing that I need you to help me with, Lord Shu.

147
00:16:53,111 --> 00:16:54,697
Lady Liu.

148
00:16:55,072 --> 00:16:57,177
Do you need me to find something else for you

149
00:16:57,432 --> 00:16:58,738
to help you shed

150
00:16:59,231 --> 00:17:00,378
and suffer less?

151
00:17:10,071 --> 00:17:12,658
All right. I'll go and find more for you.

152
00:17:12,912 --> 00:17:13,912
Wait for me.

153
00:17:18,192 --> 00:17:19,777
(What a fool.)

154
00:17:21,304 --> 00:17:22,416
You see that?

155
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:24,258
- No.   - It's a Serpent Demon!

156
00:17:26,311 --> 00:17:28,632
Look closely. Lift your head.

157
00:17:30,471 --> 00:17:31,471
Serpent Demon?

158
00:17:31,586 --> 00:17:33,380
- See?   - What did they catch?

159
00:17:33,471 --> 00:17:36,218
A Serpent Demon has appeared. How rare.

160
00:17:37,551 --> 00:17:40,137
We caught this Serpent Demon in the mountains.

161
00:17:40,337 --> 00:17:42,057
She is profoundly accomplished in her cultivation

162
00:17:42,751 --> 00:17:44,498
and has gained a human form.

163
00:17:48,231 --> 00:17:49,817
Look. There are scales on her face.

164
00:17:50,031 --> 00:17:51,658
When she saw us both,

165
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:54,952
she did everything to charm us. She must be a demon.

166
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,377
She wanted to charm us with her beauty.

167
00:17:57,751 --> 00:17:59,471
Serpents are all perverts!

168
00:17:59,551 --> 00:18:01,312
Thankfully, both of us were unmoved

169
00:18:01,392 --> 00:18:02,752
and captured her together.

170
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,905
Stay still.

171
00:18:07,031 --> 00:18:10,512
This serpent demon is powerful and cunning.

172
00:18:10,592 --> 00:18:11,671
She tried to escape many times.

173
00:18:11,751 --> 00:18:13,817
We had to remove her tendons

174
00:18:14,112 --> 00:18:15,711
and lock her up in chains

175
00:18:15,791 --> 00:18:17,698
to prevent her from escaping and hurting others.

176
00:18:21,352 --> 00:18:24,231
Let's see if you dare to run and hurt others. Stay still!

177
00:18:24,311 --> 00:18:25,458
Stop.

178
00:18:26,511 --> 00:18:27,698
What are you doing?

179
00:18:28,551 --> 00:18:29,938
Do you think all demons harm people?

180
00:18:30,392 --> 00:18:31,498
Even if she's a demon,

181
00:18:31,672 --> 00:18:33,097
all of you shouldn't treat her like this.

182
00:18:36,791 --> 00:18:38,552
All demons harm people.

183
00:18:38,632 --> 00:18:40,377
There are no demons that don't harm people.

184
00:18:41,031 --> 00:18:42,864
Everyone, listen to me.

185
00:18:43,367 --> 00:18:44,367
Everyone, listen to me!

186
00:18:46,271 --> 00:18:48,857
Demons are the same as humans. There are also kind and evil ones.

187
00:18:49,231 --> 00:18:50,792
All of you are acting violently

188
00:18:50,872 --> 00:18:52,352
without knowing what's right or wrong.

189
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:53,777
This is against humanity.

190
00:18:54,152 --> 00:18:55,777
Why are you being kind for no reason?

191
00:18:55,837 --> 00:18:57,579
How do you know that this demon doesn't hurt people?

192
00:18:57,660 --> 00:19:00,231
When I captured her, she was eating a kid's organs.

193
00:19:00,311 --> 00:19:01,738
Stop messing with us! Go away!

194
00:19:03,465 --> 00:19:05,544
You won't be making noise here when she eats you!

195
00:19:05,638 --> 00:19:07,099
Something must be wrong with his brain.

196
00:19:07,192 --> 00:19:08,833
- Right?   - Where does he come from?

197
00:19:08,913 --> 00:19:10,018
Seriously.

198
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,752
Do you know how difficult it was for us to capture her?

199
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:14,832
Exactly.

200
00:19:20,112 --> 00:19:21,144
(The fool)

201
00:19:21,791 --> 00:19:22,898
(has been out for so long.)

202
00:19:23,672 --> 00:19:25,137
(Did something happen to him?)

203
00:19:41,486 --> 00:19:45,256
(Rare sight, Serpent Demon appears)

204
00:19:52,672 --> 00:19:53,672
Are you all right?

205
00:19:58,392 --> 00:19:59,392
Don't be afraid.

206
00:19:59,952 --> 00:20:02,658
I am from just now...

207
00:20:07,112 --> 00:20:08,898
I remember you.

208
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:11,857
You can speak?

209
00:20:17,991 --> 00:20:18,991
Did you...

210
00:20:19,872 --> 00:20:21,738
Did you eat a child's organs?

211
00:20:22,271 --> 00:20:24,658
No. They were lying.

212
00:20:27,271 --> 00:20:30,297
I knew it. Demons weren't born evil.

213
00:20:30,551 --> 00:20:33,137
Moreover, they were just normal hunters.

214
00:20:33,791 --> 00:20:36,218
If you ate a child's organs,

215
00:20:36,511 --> 00:20:38,537
you wouldn't let them catch you easily.

216
00:20:40,432 --> 00:20:43,018
You must be a small demon who just gained your form, right?

217
00:20:47,352 --> 00:20:50,377
Are you sure you don't mind that I'm a demon?

218
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:51,784
So what?

219
00:20:52,161 --> 00:20:53,497
If you don't do anything wrong,

220
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:56,057
there's no reason for you to be trapped here to be humiliated.

221
00:20:56,711 --> 00:20:58,218
Even if you are wrong,

222
00:20:58,311 --> 00:21:00,738
the people you hurt are supposed to be the ones getting revenge.

223
00:21:01,046 --> 00:21:02,513
Why must you be locked up here

224
00:21:02,592 --> 00:21:04,377
and help them make money as a show?

225
00:21:06,392 --> 00:21:07,777
I'll think of something to get you out.

226
00:21:09,271 --> 00:21:10,344
You're going to help me get out?

227
00:21:11,389 --> 00:21:12,600
Don't be afraid.

228
00:21:12,673 --> 00:21:13,938
I'm going to save you

229
00:21:14,071 --> 00:21:15,112
so you can be free.

230
00:21:15,192 --> 00:21:16,577
I'm not going to use you.

231
00:21:18,791 --> 00:21:19,791
You...

232
00:21:20,912 --> 00:21:22,018
Don't eat this.

233
00:21:24,071 --> 00:21:26,471
- Eat this. This is good for you.   - This...

234
00:21:27,112 --> 00:21:28,112
What

235
00:21:29,872 --> 00:21:30,872
is this?

236
00:21:30,952 --> 00:21:32,057
Mulberry leaves.

237
00:21:32,632 --> 00:21:34,817
This is the time when serpents shed.

238
00:21:35,071 --> 00:21:36,537
You are weak as well.

239
00:21:36,872 --> 00:21:37,905
Eating this is good for you.

240
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:55,057
You are not a serpent.

241
00:21:57,711 --> 00:21:58,857
I...

242
00:22:00,632 --> 00:22:03,297
This rich kid is smart.

243
00:22:03,751 --> 00:22:05,537
He actually realized it.

244
00:22:06,711 --> 00:22:08,377
It makes no difference.

245
00:22:09,071 --> 00:22:11,738
Those fools

246
00:22:12,031 --> 00:22:14,258
were duped

247
00:22:14,352 --> 00:22:15,458
because of her beauty.

248
00:22:16,311 --> 00:22:17,311
No matter what,

249
00:22:17,392 --> 00:22:20,617
we can make a killing again this time.

250
00:22:23,112 --> 00:22:25,698
Thankfully, we chose this serpent woman

251
00:22:25,952 --> 00:22:27,097
who's so pretty.

252
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:30,297
That is how we could land so many big targets.

253
00:22:31,192 --> 00:22:32,898
If we succeed this time,

254
00:22:33,511 --> 00:22:36,938
we can enjoy our lives for a little longer.

255
00:22:53,632 --> 00:22:55,817
Actually, there wasn't any serpent demon.

256
00:22:56,952 --> 00:22:58,577
I was captured by accident

257
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:00,938
and they kept beating me up.

258
00:23:01,592 --> 00:23:02,698
They also forced me

259
00:23:03,791 --> 00:23:05,458
to dress up like this

260
00:23:06,592 --> 00:23:08,458
to act as the show's gimmick.

261
00:23:10,258 --> 00:23:12,636
Why are there such despicable people?

262
00:23:13,152 --> 00:23:14,225
This is infuriating!

263
00:23:14,592 --> 00:23:15,592
I'll save you.

264
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:16,864
Please wait.

265
00:23:17,471 --> 00:23:18,512
He unlocked the cage.

266
00:23:18,592 --> 00:23:19,592
Hurry!

267
00:23:23,912 --> 00:23:24,912
Quick!

268
00:23:25,751 --> 00:23:27,777
You've come back indeed.

269
00:23:27,952 --> 00:23:28,952
What?

270
00:23:29,192 --> 00:23:31,112
Are you trying to release this demon

271
00:23:31,192 --> 00:23:32,377
when we are not around?

272
00:23:33,031 --> 00:23:34,945
Miss, run! I'll hold him back!

273
00:23:36,991 --> 00:23:37,991
Don't move!

274
00:23:39,392 --> 00:23:41,031
- Let go!   - Don't move!

275
00:23:41,392 --> 00:23:42,392
Let go of me!

276
00:23:43,711 --> 00:23:45,297
Run? Where to?

277
00:23:45,912 --> 00:23:47,097
We are working together.

278
00:23:48,432 --> 00:23:50,391
Since she has been with us,

279
00:23:50,471 --> 00:23:54,178
she has duped many perverted fools like you.

280
00:23:54,311 --> 00:23:56,978
She pretends to be a serpent demon and lures young men

281
00:23:57,152 --> 00:23:59,777
before showing her true identity and acting pitiful.

282
00:23:59,952 --> 00:24:02,458
It's just an old-fashioned trick.

283
00:24:04,471 --> 00:24:06,617
However, you are a little different.

284
00:24:06,991 --> 00:24:10,297
Other people usually get scared

285
00:24:10,832 --> 00:24:13,297
yet you are trying to stop us just to let her escape.

286
00:24:14,791 --> 00:24:17,857
You are the most foolish person we've seen.

287
00:24:20,551 --> 00:24:21,911
What a huge fool.

288
00:24:21,991 --> 00:24:25,218
That's enough. Let's tie him up and ask for a ransom from his residence.

289
00:24:26,711 --> 00:24:27,711
Don't move!

290
00:24:29,872 --> 00:24:32,458
- Don't move!   - Let go! Let go of me!

291
00:24:35,511 --> 00:24:36,511
Let's go.

292
00:24:55,112 --> 00:24:56,112
All right.

293
00:25:00,231 --> 00:25:01,938
I think they won't catch up.

294
00:25:12,471 --> 00:25:13,471
Young Master.

295
00:25:15,352 --> 00:25:16,352
I...

296
00:25:18,991 --> 00:25:20,832
I did lie to you today

297
00:25:20,912 --> 00:25:22,418
but I didn't do it on purpose.

298
00:25:23,031 --> 00:25:24,352
I was captured by them.

299
00:25:24,432 --> 00:25:25,978
If I don't help them,

300
00:25:27,192 --> 00:25:29,218
they will hit and scold me.

301
00:25:29,672 --> 00:25:31,698
I'm only doing it to survive.

302
00:25:33,872 --> 00:25:34,945
I see.

303
00:25:35,791 --> 00:25:38,978
Since you are safe, don't scam other people in the future.

304
00:25:39,991 --> 00:25:41,097
Farewell.

305
00:25:43,231 --> 00:25:44,231
Young Master.

306
00:25:47,432 --> 00:25:48,432
What is it?

307
00:25:51,392 --> 00:25:54,097
I'm grateful to you for saving me.

308
00:25:54,711 --> 00:25:56,458
I'm not good at anything

309
00:25:57,311 --> 00:25:58,384
and can't repay you.

310
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:01,698
If you don't mind,

311
00:26:02,672 --> 00:26:05,377
I'm willing to serve you forever.

312
00:26:05,872 --> 00:26:09,151
Miss, I didn't expect anything in return for saving you.

313
00:26:09,231 --> 00:26:10,978
I'm doing it willingly.

314
00:26:11,711 --> 00:26:13,978
Miss, I can't accept this.

315
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:15,631
Do you not believe me

316
00:26:15,711 --> 00:26:16,857
because of what happened just now?

317
00:26:17,632 --> 00:26:18,632
Stand up.

318
00:26:22,071 --> 00:26:24,738
I know you are pitiful.

319
00:26:24,991 --> 00:26:26,258
It's all thanks to you

320
00:26:26,392 --> 00:26:28,097
for helping me back there.

321
00:26:28,636 --> 00:26:29,889
However, I heard

322
00:26:30,271 --> 00:26:32,738
many people were scammed to save you.

323
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:36,097
Whether you feel guilty or not,

324
00:26:36,231 --> 00:26:37,738
you are the only one who knows.

325
00:26:39,672 --> 00:26:43,377
I only know that a human who does evil things is scarier than a demon.

326
00:26:44,967 --> 00:26:47,738
Miss, my fiancee is still waiting for me.

327
00:26:47,872 --> 00:26:48,872
Farewell.

328
00:27:08,991 --> 00:27:09,991
Lady Liu.

329
00:27:11,511 --> 00:27:12,511
You've recovered?

330
00:27:12,952 --> 00:27:13,952
You're all right now.

331
00:27:14,192 --> 00:27:15,698
You are quite brave.

332
00:27:16,352 --> 00:27:18,178
I thought you would escape

333
00:27:18,672 --> 00:27:20,337
after you saw my demon form.

334
00:27:20,912 --> 00:27:21,912
Escape?

335
00:27:23,071 --> 00:27:24,104
Why would I?

336
00:27:24,432 --> 00:27:25,898
However, it's just too sudden.

337
00:27:26,352 --> 00:27:27,671
You should've told me sooner.

338
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,631
Why should I have told you sooner?

339
00:27:29,711 --> 00:27:31,178
We are engaged.

340
00:27:31,791 --> 00:27:33,978
We should be honest with each other.

341
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:35,817
I am a demon.

342
00:27:36,352 --> 00:27:38,498
Yes. I can see that.

343
00:27:39,551 --> 00:27:41,658
Why do you still say that we are engaged?

344
00:27:42,751 --> 00:27:43,751
The fact that you are a demon

345
00:27:44,432 --> 00:27:46,498
and how our engagement was decided by our families

346
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,698
are two separate matters.

347
00:27:52,711 --> 00:27:54,097
Do you want to marry a demon?

348
00:27:55,192 --> 00:27:56,225
No.

349
00:27:56,791 --> 00:27:57,938
I've never thought about it.

350
00:27:59,231 --> 00:28:00,304
I wanted to marry you.

351
00:28:01,031 --> 00:28:02,658
However, you are a demon.

352
00:28:03,912 --> 00:28:07,658
Now that I think about it, other men's wives cannot be compared to you.

353
00:28:08,071 --> 00:28:10,258
They don't have a pretty serpent body like yours.

354
00:28:16,751 --> 00:28:17,751
Pretty?

355
00:28:20,276 --> 00:28:22,530
It's even prettier than the ones in the "Compendium of Demons".

356
00:28:23,031 --> 00:28:24,698
It's the prettiest I've seen.

357
00:28:26,711 --> 00:28:27,978
You are speaking like

358
00:28:28,471 --> 00:28:30,738
you've seen other serpent demons.

359
00:28:32,112 --> 00:28:33,857
I wanted to give you a surprise

360
00:28:34,031 --> 00:28:35,458
but the loach was too ugly.

361
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:37,337
I'm sure you won't be interested.

362
00:28:37,751 --> 00:28:38,751
What?

363
00:28:40,152 --> 00:28:41,617
I mean the "Compendium of Demons"

364
00:28:41,832 --> 00:28:45,258
didn't mention a pretty demon like you.

365
00:28:55,751 --> 00:28:57,258
Do you still think I am pretty?

366
00:29:00,592 --> 00:29:03,498
No one can know that I'm a Serpent Demon.

367
00:29:03,912 --> 00:29:05,817
If you dare tell anyone,

368
00:29:06,073 --> 00:29:08,980
I will eat you up.

369
00:29:09,711 --> 00:29:10,711
So,

370
00:29:11,271 --> 00:29:12,577
you'd better watch your mouth.

371
00:29:17,152 --> 00:29:18,817
Lady Liu, where are you going?

372
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:19,912
Back to Chang'an.

373
00:29:20,511 --> 00:29:22,018
All right. I'll go with you.

374
00:29:27,871 --> 00:29:30,775
(Duke Wu's Residence)

375
00:29:40,872 --> 00:29:41,872
Lady Ming Zhuang.

376
00:29:48,352 --> 00:29:50,097
What are you doing?

377
00:29:50,392 --> 00:29:52,658
These are the betrothal gifts from our young master.

378
00:29:53,791 --> 00:29:54,791
Betrothal gift?

379
00:29:55,392 --> 00:29:56,658
Has Lady Wu Zhen agreed?

380
00:29:57,071 --> 00:29:58,898
That's a given.

381
00:29:59,311 --> 00:30:01,938
Young Master is traveling with Her Highness today.

382
00:30:02,352 --> 00:30:05,978
He will propose when both of them are alone.

383
00:30:09,192 --> 00:30:10,297
Alone?

384
00:30:11,392 --> 00:30:12,392
Where are they?

385
00:30:12,912 --> 00:30:14,258
Outside Chang'an.

386
00:30:14,471 --> 00:30:15,817
Lin'an River.

387
00:30:27,711 --> 00:30:28,711
Wu. Zhen.

388
00:30:29,432 --> 00:30:31,698
Why do you tell Mr. Mei that?

389
00:30:32,112 --> 00:30:34,218
What are you talking about, Lady Ming Zhuang?

390
00:30:34,352 --> 00:30:37,537
Mr. Mei asked so we answered.

391
00:30:49,912 --> 00:30:50,912
Lady Wu Zhen.

392
00:30:52,311 --> 00:30:53,311
Lady Wu Zhen.

393
00:30:58,467 --> 00:31:00,520
(This is bad. Something's wrong with the fragrance.)

394
00:31:11,529 --> 00:31:12,529
Commissioner Mei,

395
00:31:12,610 --> 00:31:14,046
Young Master and Princess Qinghe

396
00:31:14,116 --> 00:31:15,601
are enjoying themselves on the Lin'an River.

397
00:31:15,682 --> 00:31:17,191
Those who are unrelated mustn't disturb them.

398
00:31:17,271 --> 00:31:19,458
Sorry. I must disturb them.

399
00:31:21,432 --> 00:31:22,432
Commissioner Mei!

400
00:31:54,791 --> 00:31:56,137
Wu Zhen, what are you looking at?

401
00:31:57,231 --> 00:31:58,857
There are rumors in Chang'an

402
00:31:59,192 --> 00:32:01,178
saying that there are demons in Chang'an.

403
00:32:01,872 --> 00:32:03,537
Have you heard about such rumors?

404
00:32:05,832 --> 00:32:08,057
The rumors are nonsense mentioned by ignorant people.

405
00:32:08,511 --> 00:32:11,617
There are no evil spirits in this world.

406
00:32:12,551 --> 00:32:14,577
Don't overthink, Wu Zhen.

407
00:32:15,912 --> 00:32:18,018
However, all of them sounded sincere.

408
00:32:18,152 --> 00:32:19,898
It's hard for me not to believe in them.

409
00:32:21,953 --> 00:32:23,792
There are many stories

410
00:32:23,854 --> 00:32:25,804
about evil spirits and strange incidents in this old book.

411
00:32:26,632 --> 00:32:28,297
One of the stories

412
00:32:29,192 --> 00:32:33,018
is about a person who makes a deal with a demon

413
00:32:33,471 --> 00:32:36,418
by using his flesh and blood in exchange for what he wants.

414
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,738
Ji Ya, do you think it's interesting?

415
00:32:43,511 --> 00:32:44,872
It's interesting.

416
00:32:44,952 --> 00:32:47,018
I've never heard about it before.

417
00:32:47,592 --> 00:32:48,592
What next?

418
00:32:48,791 --> 00:32:49,938
Later,

419
00:32:50,192 --> 00:32:52,337
this man became a demon himself.

420
00:33:27,192 --> 00:33:30,337
If I had known that you were interested in these books,

421
00:33:30,592 --> 00:33:32,537
I would've gathered them for you.

422
00:33:37,392 --> 00:33:39,617
What is this incense pattern?

423
00:33:40,751 --> 00:33:41,751
An auspicious cloud.

424
00:33:49,031 --> 00:33:51,258
Do you have any questions, Wu Zhen?

425
00:33:51,639 --> 00:33:53,039
The pattern on the incense burner

426
00:33:53,110 --> 00:33:54,776
looks like an auspicious cloud from the front

427
00:33:55,791 --> 00:33:57,577
but from my side,

428
00:33:58,672 --> 00:34:00,777
it looks like an eye is hidden inside.

429
00:34:30,031 --> 00:34:31,031
Who are you?

430
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:50,537
(Oh no. It's the suppression technique.)

431
00:35:43,111 --> 00:35:45,591
There's a story about eyes

432
00:35:45,671 --> 00:35:47,378
in this book.

433
00:35:51,392 --> 00:35:52,712
Take a look, Ji Ya.

434
00:35:52,792 --> 00:35:53,792
Sure.

435
00:36:06,352 --> 00:36:07,352
Wu Zhen,

436
00:36:08,191 --> 00:36:09,418
are you joking with me?

437
00:36:09,631 --> 00:36:11,858
There's nothing in this book.

438
00:36:15,031 --> 00:36:17,498
That's impossible. Look closely.

439
00:36:51,792 --> 00:36:54,577
This book has an unknown origin and brings bad luck.

440
00:36:55,111 --> 00:36:57,458
You shouldn't read it.

441
00:38:13,071 --> 00:38:15,071
Wu Zhen, no!

442
00:38:22,752 --> 00:38:25,858
No. I must stop the formation.

443
00:38:32,872 --> 00:38:33,872
Wu Zhen,

444
00:38:34,312 --> 00:38:35,938
you mustn't die.

445
00:38:42,551 --> 00:38:43,551
Who are you?

446
00:38:44,191 --> 00:38:45,632
You are wrong.

447
00:38:45,712 --> 00:38:47,018
I am not a person.

448
00:39:18,511 --> 00:39:19,511
You are fine?

449
00:39:20,111 --> 00:39:21,778
You, on the other hand, are in deep trouble.

450
00:39:35,392 --> 00:39:36,392
Let's go!

451
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:24,671
Run!

452
00:40:39,191 --> 00:40:41,338
It's the suppression technique indeed.

453
00:40:41,631 --> 00:40:42,631
Yes!

454
00:40:43,312 --> 00:40:45,097
Mei had ill intentions.

455
00:40:45,631 --> 00:40:47,257
He has harassed Wu Zhen all day long.

456
00:40:47,712 --> 00:40:49,312
I only wanted to teach him a lesson.

457
00:40:49,392 --> 00:40:50,392
What's wrong with that?

458
00:40:53,232 --> 00:40:54,232
Stay away!

459
00:40:54,792 --> 00:40:56,792
My benefactor is an expert.

460
00:40:56,872 --> 00:40:57,872
If you hurt me,

461
00:40:57,952 --> 00:40:59,097
he won't forgive you!

462
00:41:09,952 --> 00:41:10,952
Unlock the formation!

463
00:41:19,432 --> 00:41:21,057
I'll give you one last chance.

464
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:22,737
Unlock the formation immediately!

465
00:41:23,432 --> 00:41:24,432
This formation

466
00:41:24,591 --> 00:41:25,591
cannot be unlocked.
