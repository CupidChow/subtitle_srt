00:01:27,264 --> 00:01:31,000
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,040
(Episode 38)

3
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,586
A New Moon's night.

4
00:02:13,879 --> 00:02:15,665
Its plan is beginning.

5
00:02:29,960 --> 00:02:31,265
I didn't expect you

6
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,306
to leave Demon Prison on your own.

7
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,985
I underestimated you.

8
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,866
Even if you escaped, so what?

9
00:02:43,039 --> 00:02:45,586
What can you change?

10
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:51,225
The Sinister Fiend will surely revive today.

11
00:02:52,923 --> 00:02:56,310
You have the Sinister Fiend's core

12
00:02:56,479 --> 00:02:58,505
so I will spare you.

13
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,545
However, I might not do the same

14
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,825
for that young man beside you.

15
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,705
You can't blame me

16
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:09,985
if he has a death wish.

17
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:40,873
Get in formation!

18
00:04:56,759 --> 00:04:57,832
That's not right.

19
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:00,705
It'll be night soon.

20
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:04,265
Why hasn't the core inside you reacted?

21
00:05:23,073 --> 00:05:24,879
If we allow the sinister energy to enter Chang'an,

22
00:05:24,903 --> 00:05:26,409
everything will be too late.

23
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:28,066
Quick, think of something!

24
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:37,352
Say it!

25
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:40,265
What did you do to the Sinister Fiend Infant?

26
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:43,746
Tell me immediately!

27
00:06:00,399 --> 00:06:01,666
I only know

28
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:04,186
that it's right

29
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:07,145
for a cat to eat a mouse.

30
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:11,832
Do you think

31
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:14,119
you've stopped everything

32
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:17,306
by doing this?

33
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:25,392
Demonic ulcers?

34
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:34,746
No wonder. The core isn't in my body.

35
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:39,265
This is supposed to be my trial.

36
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:41,905
Why are you changing my fate?

37
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,345
I'm not changing your fate.

38
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,746
I'm just getting back mine.

39
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,505
Be careful. It's slippery.

40
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:09,145
- Thank you. - Lady Wu Zhen!

41
00:08:09,600 --> 00:08:11,536
- Lady Wu Zhen! - My family is searching for me.

42
00:08:11,560 --> 00:08:12,633
I'm leaving.

43
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,106
You must be careful too.

44
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:18,073
Wait.

45
00:08:19,040 --> 00:08:20,040
Your lantern is broken.

46
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:21,426
Let me give you my lantern.

47
00:08:26,399 --> 00:08:27,472
Thank you.

48
00:08:32,879 --> 00:08:33,952
That lantern

49
00:08:34,679 --> 00:08:36,066
was given to me by my father.

50
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,825
It contains the Cat Lord's power.

51
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:42,066
18 years ago,

52
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:45,839
the Sinister Fiend didn't choose you because you passed by coincidentally

53
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:49,666
but because it mistook you for me

54
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:53,026
because of that lantern.

55
00:08:59,399 --> 00:09:00,472
Sorry.

56
00:09:01,919 --> 00:09:04,105
Your fate was changed 18 years ago because of me.

57
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:09,273
Thankfully,

58
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:13,945
everything is still not too late.

59
00:09:33,159 --> 00:09:34,585
If you want to stop this,

60
00:09:39,879 --> 00:09:40,985
just kill me.

61
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,073
No.

62
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:34,592
Later...

63
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:36,313
No.

64
00:10:37,039 --> 00:10:39,105
- No. - Don't hesitate.

65
00:10:47,039 --> 00:10:48,745
I don't want to do it!

66
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:20,105
The Sinister Fiend Infant

67
00:11:21,559 --> 00:11:22,632
has been revived.

68
00:11:33,840 --> 00:11:34,913
Brother Mei!

69
00:11:40,039 --> 00:11:41,112
There's no use.

70
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,393
I don't believe it.

71
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,186
Hurry! I can't trap it inside anymore!

72
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,632
Wu Zhen.

73
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:02,193
Besides me,

74
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:04,721
you are the only one who can wield the Changxi Truncheon.

75
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,273
Hurry!

76
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,506
You know what you should do.

77
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,352
Hurry!

78
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:26,146
It has been 18 years!

79
00:12:26,919 --> 00:12:30,625
I've finally returned!

80
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:34,745
The Sinister Fiend Infant?

81
00:12:37,639 --> 00:12:38,712
I can't do it.

82
00:12:40,840 --> 00:12:43,825
As long as evil thoughts still exist in this world,

83
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:46,345
I will not die!

84
00:12:46,919 --> 00:12:49,280
This time, I can finally

85
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:51,865
rebuilt a demon city that belongs to me!

86
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,906
I will show the demons in the future

87
00:12:55,159 --> 00:12:57,079
a brand new world

88
00:12:57,159 --> 00:12:58,865
of demons

89
00:12:59,008 --> 00:13:01,113
that I create!

90
00:13:01,440 --> 00:13:02,775
It's a new path for humans and demons

91
00:13:02,799 --> 00:13:05,386
that I provide!

92
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:27,712
Dear.

93
00:13:32,559 --> 00:13:34,266
Are you really going to kill me?

94
00:13:45,159 --> 00:13:46,906
I'm sure you are reluctant to do it.

95
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,345
Put it down.

96
00:13:51,039 --> 00:13:52,112
In the future,

97
00:13:53,679 --> 00:13:55,666
we will be together forever.

98
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,465
The Taoist and Demonic ways

99
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:18,666
repel each other in their core

100
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:19,945
and cannot be fused.

101
00:14:20,600 --> 00:14:21,839
If you learn it,

102
00:14:21,919 --> 00:14:23,640
you will be the first person to do it

103
00:14:23,720 --> 00:14:24,793
in all the realms.

104
00:14:28,209 --> 00:14:30,168
Lady Wu Zhen, you just recovered

105
00:14:30,249 --> 00:14:31,945
and need to regulate your body internally.

106
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:35,345
The Changxi Truncheon Manual can be used to calm one's heart.

107
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:38,225
This might be able to help you.

108
00:14:48,930 --> 00:14:50,766
When you are facing the toughest situation

109
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,225
and a choice that you have to make,

110
00:14:55,720 --> 00:14:56,793
you will

111
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,666
understand it at that moment.

112
00:16:52,759 --> 00:16:56,345
Do you feel something wrong just now?

113
00:17:49,359 --> 00:17:51,226
When we got married,

114
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:54,145
I thought

115
00:17:56,759 --> 00:17:59,706
it was just an experience in life as a human.

116
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:03,585
I didn't expect so many things to happen.

117
00:18:05,559 --> 00:18:06,946
Young Man,

118
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,706
you are handsome.

119
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:10,506
What is your name?

120
00:18:12,119 --> 00:18:13,345
I am Mei Zhu Yu.

121
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,226
You are all alone without family.

122
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:30,273
I am someone

123
00:18:30,839 --> 00:18:33,946
who always fools around.

124
00:18:34,759 --> 00:18:36,385
We are both outstanding.

125
00:18:37,359 --> 00:18:39,066
Aren't we a match made in heaven?

126
00:18:45,599 --> 00:18:47,306
You made me greedy

127
00:18:48,599 --> 00:18:49,746
and fall in love.

128
00:18:51,079 --> 00:18:52,080
Even if you

129
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:53,585
lose interest

130
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:56,912
get annoyed,

131
00:18:57,640 --> 00:18:59,713
hatred, or bored one day,

132
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:05,185
you can't abandon me.

133
00:19:12,039 --> 00:19:13,585
You won't lose me.

134
00:19:15,319 --> 00:19:16,946
I will never leave you.

135
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:19,073
It's true.

136
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,385
I won't let you go.

137
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:39,713
Wu Zhen.

138
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,473
From now on,

139
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:51,746
I will never let myself

140
00:19:52,200 --> 00:19:54,026
or other people hurt you.

141
00:19:56,799 --> 00:19:59,625
Mei Zhu Yu!

142
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,306
We are different from them.

143
00:20:08,759 --> 00:20:10,546
I can't put you in danger.

144
00:20:21,599 --> 00:20:23,266
I feel so guilty.

145
00:20:27,680 --> 00:20:30,825
You used your whole life as a mortal to be with me

146
00:20:33,799 --> 00:20:34,872
but I...

147
00:20:36,519 --> 00:20:39,506
I only took a moment in my life as a human

148
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:41,345
to be with you.

149
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:46,585
Sorry.

150
00:20:52,359 --> 00:20:53,905
I'm so sorry.

151
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:57,105
You are the Cat Lord.

152
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,905
I just feel sad

153
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:11,793
that

154
00:21:16,839 --> 00:21:18,585
life is too short.

155
00:22:04,279 --> 00:22:05,352
Mr. Mei.

156
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:13,713
Mr. Mei.

157
00:22:15,480 --> 00:22:17,066
Mr. Mei, look at me.

158
00:22:18,079 --> 00:22:19,865
Open your eyes and look at me.

159
00:22:21,119 --> 00:22:23,306
Open your eyes and look at me!

160
00:22:25,599 --> 00:22:27,066
Look at me.

161
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:30,266
Open your eyes and look at me!

162
00:22:31,400 --> 00:22:33,226
Look at me.

163
00:22:40,279 --> 00:22:42,946
Talk to me.

164
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:46,786
Look at me!

165
00:22:49,359 --> 00:22:51,746
Look at me!

166
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:58,145
Look at me!

167
00:23:11,200 --> 00:23:13,905
Look at me!

168
00:23:36,924 --> 00:23:41,400
(Three Months Later)

169
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,145
Look. I bought this when I passed by the town.

170
00:24:44,759 --> 00:24:46,519
Shuang Jiang, the shopkeeper said

171
00:24:46,599 --> 00:24:48,039
this was Ruyi Pavilion's signature.

172
00:24:48,119 --> 00:24:49,345
The best in Chang'an.

173
00:24:50,119 --> 00:24:51,192
Try it.

174
00:25:03,119 --> 00:25:04,192
It's not bad indeed.

175
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,160
Lady Hu Zhu

176
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:10,625
is good at doing business.

177
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:12,033
Unlike us.

178
00:25:12,192 --> 00:25:13,392
We can't even

179
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:15,306
manage Changxi Palace.

180
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:19,840
Everyone has...

181
00:25:19,920 --> 00:25:21,240
Everyone has their own ambitions.

182
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:22,840
Don't belittle yourself.

183
00:25:22,920 --> 00:25:25,665
Besides, aren't we taking jobs after leaving the mountain?

184
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:28,266
We captured a few demons.

185
00:25:29,599 --> 00:25:30,672
It seems like

186
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,226
Changxi Palace will be able to last longer.

187
00:25:33,920 --> 00:25:34,993
Otherwise...

188
00:25:36,319 --> 00:25:37,392
Shuang Jiang.

189
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,273
Shuang Jiang.

190
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:42,825
Bring Brother Lian Fu back.

191
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,585
We will deal with the next demon.

192
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:47,585
You've been working hard in recent days.

193
00:25:49,559 --> 00:25:50,632
No need.

194
00:25:50,759 --> 00:25:52,226
They are just some small demons.

195
00:25:53,319 --> 00:25:54,392
I can handle it.

196
00:26:11,079 --> 00:26:12,585
You can handle it

197
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:14,226
but your legs can't.

198
00:26:17,778 --> 00:26:21,880
(Ruyi Pavilion)

199
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:26,506
Steamed Cakes!

200
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:28,306
Steamed Cakes!

201
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:30,226
Steamed Cakes!

202
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:32,185
Steamed Cakes!

203
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,560
Delicious Steamed Cakes!

204
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:35,199
Unique Steamed Cakes!

205
00:26:35,279 --> 00:26:36,320
Have some Steamed Cakes.

206
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,313
- Give me two. - Sure.

207
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,560
You are here at the right time.

208
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,479
These Steamed Cakes are freshly made.

209
00:26:42,559 --> 00:26:43,953
- Is that so? - Try it.

210
00:26:54,319 --> 00:26:56,279
One cent for each. Two cents.

211
00:26:56,359 --> 00:26:58,306
- Two cents? Sure. - Thank you.

212
00:26:59,291 --> 00:27:00,392
Let's go.

213
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:21,592
Take care.

214
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:23,953
Take care.

215
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:11,226
- That was good yesterday. - Yes.

216
00:28:11,400 --> 00:28:12,600
Isn't that Fourth Master Mei?

217
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,840
Let's go and take a look.

218
00:28:13,920 --> 00:28:14,993
Let's go.

219
00:28:16,200 --> 00:28:18,080
- Brother Mei. - Fourth Master Mei, Not bad.

220
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:20,920
I heard your "New Compendium of Demons" was selling well.

221
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,946
It is more popular than Fifth Master Xie's poem compilation.

222
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:27,145
Those are not Fifth Master Xie's.

223
00:28:27,319 --> 00:28:28,360
Speaking of which,

224
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:31,160
I've seen the "New Compendium of Demons".

225
00:28:31,240 --> 00:28:32,825
There might be many

226
00:28:33,079 --> 00:28:34,759
drawings of demons inside

227
00:28:34,839 --> 00:28:37,345
but they aren't scary.

228
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,280
The demons are even... How do I put it?

229
00:28:41,360 --> 00:28:43,746
Vivid, heartwarming, and touching.

230
00:28:43,960 --> 00:28:45,033
That's right.

231
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,706
That's too much praise.

232
00:28:48,864 --> 00:28:51,857
All of you read it and I'm the only one who failed to buy it?

233
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:56,033
Mister,

234
00:28:56,119 --> 00:28:57,120
I have a new one here.

235
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:59,273
If you don't mind, I want to give it to you.

236
00:28:59,720 --> 00:29:00,793
Are you sure?

237
00:29:01,039 --> 00:29:02,112
Thank you.

238
00:29:03,759 --> 00:29:04,840
We'll be leaving then.

239
00:29:04,920 --> 00:29:05,993
Farewell.

240
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,266
Here's your snack.

241
00:29:10,759 --> 00:29:11,832
Here you go.

242
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:15,793
Enjoy.

243
00:29:19,160 --> 00:29:20,160
Fourth Master Mei.

244
00:29:20,240 --> 00:29:21,665
Sorry.

245
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,466
I was in a rush.

246
00:29:24,000 --> 00:29:25,266
Are they broken?

247
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:27,479
Thankfully, they are fine.

248
00:29:27,559 --> 00:29:29,840
This belongs to someone else. I want to return it to him.

249
00:30:00,247 --> 00:30:04,680
(The dolls are passionate and not foolish)

250
00:30:33,759 --> 00:30:35,585
Where did you get this from?

251
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:37,625
What do you think? Isn't it interesting?

252
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:40,121
- Not bad. - Does everyone in the Mei family

253
00:30:40,201 --> 00:30:41,640
like to threaten me?

254
00:30:41,720 --> 00:30:43,520
Is this a skill you inherit from your family?

255
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,026
Fine. I won't say anything else.

256
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,625
What do you want to buy in Demon City?

257
00:30:49,039 --> 00:30:50,959
When I came to Demon City previously,

258
00:30:51,039 --> 00:30:52,719
there were some miraculous herbs.

259
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:53,946
My father is ill.

260
00:30:54,303 --> 00:30:55,703
I'm here to find medicine for him.

261
00:30:55,799 --> 00:30:56,872
Wait.

262
00:30:57,359 --> 00:30:58,559
What's wrong with your father?

263
00:30:59,559 --> 00:31:01,759
His heart is blazing

264
00:31:01,839 --> 00:31:03,279
and he is getting more hot-tempered.

265
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:06,385
I don't think taking medicine helps.

266
00:31:08,920 --> 00:31:10,840
Are you sure you are just here to seek medicine?

267
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:17,953
Where are you going?

268
00:31:18,759 --> 00:31:19,832
Here you go.

269
00:31:20,039 --> 00:31:21,279
I want candy!

270
00:31:21,359 --> 00:31:23,439
I don't have any more. Do you want more?

271
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:25,239
- Wait. - I'm all out.

272
00:31:25,319 --> 00:31:27,360
If you want more, come with me.

273
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:28,959
Don't go. Don't run.

274
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,112
Come with me.

275
00:31:31,359 --> 00:31:32,719
I've told you many times

276
00:31:32,799 --> 00:31:34,066
not to run.

277
00:31:34,440 --> 00:31:36,377
Have you forgotten how you tripped like a dog last time?

278
00:31:36,401 --> 00:31:38,519
Mr. Ling Xiao, I told you many times.

279
00:31:38,599 --> 00:31:39,746
I'm not a dog.

280
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:42,145
I'm a Black Snake. A Black Snake.

281
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:45,625
Can you not grab my collar all the time?

282
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:47,800
Yes.

283
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,300
You are Demon City's only Black Snake.

284
00:31:49,324 --> 00:31:51,455
You'll become a dragon and ascend to Heaven when you grow up.

285
00:31:51,479 --> 00:31:53,425
You've been telling me this all the time.

286
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,999
The Rain Dragon clan is magnanimous.

287
00:31:56,079 --> 00:31:57,506
I will forgive you.

288
00:31:57,960 --> 00:31:59,185
Thank you.

289
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:03,055
- Let me introduce you to a friend. - I don't want to know who he is.

290
00:32:03,079 --> 00:32:04,152
No.

291
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:05,553
Let's go.

292
00:32:08,079 --> 00:32:09,152
Stand here.

293
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,313
Little Black Snake.

294
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,986
No one is bullying you here, right?

295
00:32:14,767 --> 00:32:17,914
A pig demon threw stones at me last time.

296
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:20,471
However, Miss Serpent Lord

297
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,746
told his father.

298
00:32:23,079 --> 00:32:25,625
His father already beat him up.

299
00:32:26,039 --> 00:32:29,345
No other demon has dared bully me ever since.

300
00:32:30,119 --> 00:32:31,192
That's great.

301
00:32:32,359 --> 00:32:33,466
Who are you?

302
00:32:33,759 --> 00:32:36,266
Are you from the Rain Dragon Clan like me?

303
00:32:37,513 --> 00:32:38,719
I'm not.

304
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:39,800
However,

305
00:32:39,880 --> 00:32:41,934
I have a friend like you.

306
00:32:42,015 --> 00:32:44,336
He is a mighty Rain Dragon.

307
00:32:44,417 --> 00:32:46,559
You do look a little old.

308
00:32:46,640 --> 00:32:47,786
Your friend

309
00:32:48,119 --> 00:32:50,306
might be my grandfather.

310
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:53,352
Slow down.

311
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:54,753
Slow down!

312
00:33:11,319 --> 00:33:13,105
Serpent Lord.

313
00:34:01,640 --> 00:34:03,585
You must

314
00:34:03,839 --> 00:34:05,105
fold the diagonal.

315
00:34:05,759 --> 00:34:06,865
This is crucial.

316
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:09,826
This is wrong.

317
00:34:10,760 --> 00:34:12,745
You must line them up before folding.

318
00:34:13,549 --> 00:34:15,869
- Yes. Line it up and fold it. - Line it up and fold it.

319
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:19,880
Your Highness, be careful.

320
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,159
Don't cut your hand.

321
00:34:21,239 --> 00:34:22,785
Why don't I help you do it?

322
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,466
You know nothing. She doesn't need you.

323
00:34:26,360 --> 00:34:27,665
Do it yourself.

324
00:34:31,519 --> 00:34:32,592
Here.

325
00:34:32,719 --> 00:34:34,305
Let me demonstrate to you again.

326
00:34:34,519 --> 00:34:35,592
Look.

327
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:38,946
You must cut along the edge.

328
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:40,466
Cut along the edge.

329
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,066
Steady.

330
00:34:56,320 --> 00:34:57,393
What do you think?

331
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,433
Is it pretty?

332
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,986
Yes.

333
00:35:04,119 --> 00:35:05,959
- Is it pretty? - Yes.

334
00:35:06,039 --> 00:35:07,665
Your Majesty, you're amazing.

335
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:10,705
You have good taste.

336
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,479
It's troublesome to rebuild Demon City.

337
00:35:53,559 --> 00:35:54,866
It has been three months

338
00:35:54,960 --> 00:35:57,386
and the mess during New Year's Eve has yet to be dealt with.

339
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,185
Chang'an, on the other hand, is peaceful.

340
00:36:04,199 --> 00:36:05,386
However, you don't know

341
00:36:06,039 --> 00:36:08,839
how many demons and demonic cultivators are causing trouble out there.

342
00:36:09,239 --> 00:36:10,826
I might have to leave Chang'an

343
00:36:11,360 --> 00:36:12,986
after a while.

344
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:16,026
Your Highness, are you awake?

345
00:36:16,719 --> 00:36:17,946
I am!

346
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:26,546
Mei Zhu Yu,

347
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,145
you've been sleeping for three months.

348
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:31,015
No matter how long a powerful demon lives,

349
00:36:31,039 --> 00:36:32,986
you still can't waste your life like this.

350
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:35,225
If you don't wake up,

351
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:37,265
I'm going to be angry for real.

352
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:40,665
Your Highness, it's time for breakfast.

353
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:43,386
Coming.

354
00:36:45,360 --> 00:36:46,400
Wen Hua,

355
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:47,665
what are we having today?

356
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:23,756
(The End)

357
00:39:55,812 --> 00:39:57,507
This has a cherry filling. It's sweet and sour.

358
00:39:57,531 --> 00:39:58,760
Fruits and nuts. It's savory.

359
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,986
There's also milk pastry.

360
00:40:00,067 --> 00:40:01,936
Those on the plates were fried with clarified butter.

361
00:40:01,960 --> 00:40:03,946
They have sesame on top and are delicious.

362
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:18,785
Dear Guest, which are you buying?

363
00:40:21,119 --> 00:40:22,192
Mr. Mei.

364
00:40:22,920 --> 00:40:23,993
Mr. Mei.

365
00:40:24,679 --> 00:40:26,359
You've been standing here for a long time.

366
00:40:26,639 --> 00:40:27,906
Which one are you buying?

367
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:31,913
Why don't we...

368
00:40:35,400 --> 00:40:36,440
We are getting everything.

369
00:40:36,519 --> 00:40:37,592
Sure.

370
00:40:39,760 --> 00:40:43,386
I heard there's a pear seller on the streets.

371
00:40:43,986 --> 00:40:47,412
Keeper Cui's wife liked it when she was pregnant.

372
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,625
Are you Commissioner Mei from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau?

373
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:04,513
- Have we met? - Well, no.

374
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:11,426
Mr. Mei, I told you to be more restrained.

375
00:41:12,199 --> 00:41:13,745
There are rumors in Chang'an

376
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:16,305
saying that Commissioner Mei

377
00:41:16,639 --> 00:41:19,439
from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau will appear suddenly

378
00:41:19,519 --> 00:41:22,039
when the favorite food of someone's pregnant wife is mentioned.

379
00:41:23,719 --> 00:41:24,866
That's an exaggeration.

380
00:41:26,431 --> 00:41:28,176
Mr. Mei, seriously.

381
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,625
It is true that women's tastes usually change

382
00:41:30,760 --> 00:41:32,826
when they are pregnant

383
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:34,906
but there's no need to buy so many

384
00:41:35,280 --> 00:41:36,906
with the salary you are making.

385
00:41:37,760 --> 00:41:39,986
I am just buying some

386
00:41:40,159 --> 00:41:41,232
just in case.

387
00:41:42,079 --> 00:41:43,152
Are you sure

388
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:44,752
you are just buying some?

389
00:42:00,320 --> 00:42:01,393
Dear.

390
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:04,360
You are finally back.

391
00:42:04,440 --> 00:42:06,346
I feel so bored here alone.

392
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,353
Wait!

393
00:42:22,639 --> 00:42:23,712
That doll...

394
00:42:27,679 --> 00:42:29,665
I told you to wait.

395
00:42:31,079 --> 00:42:33,105
Wait. Let's not switch for now.

396
00:42:33,840 --> 00:42:34,913
Why?

397
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:43,386
It has been seven months.

398
00:42:44,639 --> 00:42:46,265
I've endured for seven months.

399
00:42:47,519 --> 00:42:48,592
I am going

400
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:51,745
to Ruyi Pavilion

401
00:42:52,639 --> 00:42:53,785
to drink right away.
