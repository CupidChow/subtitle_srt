00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,024
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,129 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 23)

3
00:01:34,887 --> 00:01:35,887
I know.

4
00:01:36,183 --> 00:01:38,358
Changxi Truncheon is a keepsake of Master's.

5
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:39,679
You can't bear to part with it.

6
00:01:39,808 --> 00:01:41,704
But it belongs to Changxi Palace after all.

7
00:01:43,959 --> 00:01:45,519
You have to look at the bigger picture.

8
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:47,295
Brother Chang Ming, you...

9
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:50,135
You're just pouring salt on his wound.

10
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,176
I wish to leave the sect, and I'll accept any punishment for that.

11
00:01:56,575 --> 00:02:00,746
That doesn't mean I'm going to cast away my duties as a Celestial Master.

12
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:03,896
Slaying demons

13
00:02:04,760 --> 00:02:07,295
and getting rid of evil are still my goals in life.

14
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:12,695
It's just that there's someone I need to protect now.

15
00:02:19,439 --> 00:02:20,439
Zhu Yu...

16
00:02:22,599 --> 00:02:24,480
Zhu Yu, don't worry.

17
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,416
Master said that Brother Chang Ming is hardworking and upright.

18
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:32,016
I'm sure he's the most suitable wielder of Changxi Truncheon.

19
00:02:40,869 --> 00:02:45,005
If so, I'll entrust it to you, Sect Leader.

20
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:02,970
There's one more thing. Although you're leaving the sect,

21
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:05,136
you grew up here after all.

22
00:03:06,039 --> 00:03:07,975
You need to make a vow before leaving.

23
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,691
Once you leave this gate,

24
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,416
you're not to mention a single word about Changxi Palace.

25
00:03:17,199 --> 00:03:18,199
All right.

26
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:19,960
I hereby swear

27
00:03:22,039 --> 00:03:24,056
that I won't tell anyone about Changxi Palace.

28
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:28,105
If not, you'll lose your loved ones and come to a bad end.

29
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,000
If not,

30
00:03:35,479 --> 00:03:38,942
I'll lose my loved ones and come to a bad end.

31
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:41,360
Congratulations on getting what you want.

32
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:43,102
The matter is over.

33
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:45,284
You may go now.

34
00:03:45,423 --> 00:03:46,423
I'll see him off.

35
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:47,560
No need for that.

36
00:03:48,312 --> 00:03:50,783
Shuang Jiang, you should head back.

37
00:03:50,939 --> 00:03:51,939
I'll see him off.

38
00:03:52,512 --> 00:03:53,592
But you...

39
00:03:53,901 --> 00:03:55,902
Right now, he's no match for you.

40
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,655
Don't worry. I'm just chasing him away.

41
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:00,856
I won't take his life.

42
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:21,296
You can have this horse.

43
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,656
Hurry and return to Chang'an.

44
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,015
Brother Xiao Mu, apart from cultivation, your only interests are horses.

45
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:31,200
Why would you grant me your favorite steed?

46
00:04:34,149 --> 00:04:38,296
I just want you to leave quickly and never come back.

47
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,528
You and I were distant since young.

48
00:04:40,936 --> 00:04:43,352
Why did you help me out when I was in the White Night Array?

49
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:47,721
I don't know why you joined Changxi Palace.

50
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,976
I joined it to cultivate my skills.

51
00:04:52,167 --> 00:04:56,942
Since it's a place of cultivation, no blood must be shed there.

52
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Thank you.

53
00:05:20,199 --> 00:05:23,056
Zhu Yu, why are you standing there?

54
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,776
Master, I have something to ask you.

55
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:28,160
Ask away.

56
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:31,616
Master, you gave all nine of my seniors a Daoist name.

57
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:34,776
I'm the only one using my real name.

58
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:38,320
I heard from Brother Lu Yang that I was different from them.

59
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:41,255
I'm not considered one of your official disciples.

60
00:05:41,920 --> 00:05:45,096
Therefore, I'm not an official member of Changxi Palace.

61
00:05:45,639 --> 00:05:48,176
Master, is that true?

62
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:52,199
About that...

63
00:05:56,800 --> 00:05:57,976
Seems like it's true.

64
00:05:59,109 --> 00:06:00,909
Master, why didn't you give me a Daoist name?

65
00:06:01,175 --> 00:06:02,959
Zhu Yu, don't misunderstand me.

66
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:07,063
I didn't give you a Daoist name because I made a divination.

67
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:13,416
I know that you'll leave our sect eventually.

68
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:17,349
Master, don't you intend to make me stay?

69
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,455
Changxi Palace cannot keep you here.

70
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,216
You have an obsession that you haven't gotten over.

71
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,400
That means you have unfinished business.

72
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,856
What I can do is to lend you a hand in overcoming your obstacles.

73
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:33,695
You have to return to the origin to finish your unfinished business.

74
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:41,695
In this world, everyone has desires.

75
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:44,455
What your seniors desire is here.

76
00:06:44,600 --> 00:06:47,416
But your desire isn't.

77
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,096
It seems that certain matters and certain people

78
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,656
are finally about to surface.

79
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,342
Benefactor! It's actually you!

80
00:08:31,959 --> 00:08:33,519
You're finally willing to see me again.

81
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:35,160
Benefactor, please help me.

82
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,296
How can I help you?

83
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:00,399
Please teach me your spells.

84
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:05,416
I still have my left eye and all of my limbs.

85
00:09:05,919 --> 00:09:08,279
Benefactor, I can still practice the suppression technique.

86
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:10,176
I can help you accomplish many things.

87
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,536
You couldn't even complete the menial task I assigned.

88
00:09:14,930 --> 00:09:16,386
Now, you want me to teach you?

89
00:09:16,639 --> 00:09:18,496
That's a total waste of my time.

90
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:23,176
I've already released the ink demons into Chang'an and completed your task.

91
00:09:23,679 --> 00:09:25,256
But there were unexpected occurrences.

92
00:09:25,495 --> 00:09:28,935
I've already tried my best. Benefactor, please try to understand me.

93
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,416
But what I want is to stir up rumors in Chang'an about a demon uprising.

94
00:09:35,325 --> 00:09:39,060
I need a proper excuse to bring my men to Chang'an.

95
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,136
But I've already accomplished the task as per your instructions.

96
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:46,920
It's all because you provoked that fellow outside Chang'an.

97
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,176
That's why he disobeyed my order and kept an eye on you in Chang'an.

98
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:56,935
Pei Ji Ya, you ruined my plan. How dare you still come to me?

99
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,455
- I... - What a fool.

100
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,056
You're truly useless.

101
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:02,840
Benefactor!

102
00:10:04,159 --> 00:10:06,656
You can't just burn your bridges!

103
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,056
Mr. Pei, you can't blame me for this.

104
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:12,296
You can only blame yourself for this.

105
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:17,056
You couldn't even complete such a menial task.

106
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,735
I'm already generous enough to allow you to live.

107
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:24,416
Now, you're half-blind, and you no longer have dark magic.

108
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,296
Scram. Never come to me again.

109
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:33,360
This won't do!

110
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:39,095
Sect Leader Chang Ming, you promised that you would help me to be stronger.

111
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,935
If you don't help me out,

112
00:10:42,440 --> 00:10:45,040
I'll head to Changxi Palace and find the other Celestial Masters.

113
00:10:45,080 --> 00:10:48,735
By then, if I blurt out something I wasn't supposed to,

114
00:10:48,919 --> 00:10:50,519
your position as the sect leader will...

115
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,615
Fine. Since you want to die,

116
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:03,376
I can only take it as if I've never saved you before.

117
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,416
Hey! You're a Celestial Master!

118
00:11:16,840 --> 00:11:18,855
I've given you plenty of benefits as well!

119
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:21,855
So what?

120
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:33,143
Useless fool.

121
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:24,720
It's you?

122
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,615
Mr. Pei, long time no see.

123
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:29,840
You were the one who killed Wu and Zhen!

124
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:37,735
That kind of trash is not even worthy of calling her name.

125
00:12:39,080 --> 00:12:42,575
I knew that you would find the person who taught you dark magic.

126
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,455
I never expected you

127
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,496
to wait here for days

128
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,695
without even being able to see him.

129
00:12:50,679 --> 00:12:53,815
Forget about you. Even if I was anxious for you.

130
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:55,760
You planned everything in advance, huh?

131
00:12:55,960 --> 00:12:57,256
What exactly do you want?

132
00:12:57,639 --> 00:12:58,815
I don't want anything.

133
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:03,496
Since I've found the mastermind, it's pointless to keep you alive.

134
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,578
Naturally, I'll get rid of you.

135
00:13:06,960 --> 00:13:08,896
Are you going to kill me?

136
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Just look at you.

137
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:17,335
I think your current expression fits you better.

138
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:20,376
No matter how pretentious you were,

139
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:25,296
did you think your cousin had spared you one more glance?

140
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,855
No wonder you were anxious when we were by Lin'an River.

141
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:35,199
If you're interested in Zhen, you should target Mei Zhu Yu.

142
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:36,760
I'm not your rival.

143
00:13:36,840 --> 00:13:39,376
Even if you kill me, you won't be able to obtain her.

144
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:43,256
I'm not trying to kill you because I fancy her.

145
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,176
It's because you were bold enough to drug her at Ruyi Pavilion.

146
00:13:48,200 --> 00:13:53,056
I won't allow such despicable men to appear in front of her again.

147
00:13:57,840 --> 00:13:58,935
What are you laughing at?

148
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,095
Initially, I thought that it was already hilarious enough

149
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,136
to see a weak mortal like me lose everything

150
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:08,777
after devoting all of my efforts.

151
00:14:08,960 --> 00:14:11,975
I never expected to see someone more laughable than me.

152
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:13,742
What do you mean?

153
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:18,896
Although you're powerful, you still couldn't win Zhen's heart.

154
00:14:19,519 --> 00:14:22,855
Your only choice is to vent out your anger on weaklings like us.

155
00:14:23,080 --> 00:14:24,760
You're no better than me.

156
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:27,376
I may be laughable, but you're ridiculous yourself.

157
00:14:27,840 --> 00:14:29,880
I was laughing at myself and you.

158
00:14:29,960 --> 00:14:32,136
How dare you put yourself at the same level as me?

159
00:14:32,414 --> 00:14:35,590
I was born a cripple. I didn't have an expertise either.

160
00:14:35,919 --> 00:14:40,455
Even if I live, I'll only be a laughingstock. That's pointless.

161
00:14:42,159 --> 00:14:43,159
Forget it.

162
00:14:44,159 --> 00:14:47,056
It is said that a dying person's words should be kind.

163
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:49,855
I have a piece of advice for you.

164
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,503
A piece of advice?

165
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:53,639
What is it?

166
00:14:53,879 --> 00:14:56,296
Naturally, it's for you not to imitate me.

167
00:14:57,105 --> 00:15:00,681
There's nothing wrong with struggling to make a living.

168
00:15:00,859 --> 00:15:03,300
But if you're too cunning and greedy,

169
00:15:03,440 --> 00:15:05,000
you'll bite off more than you can chew.

170
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:08,633
You'll lose your body, conscience, your beloved,

171
00:15:08,919 --> 00:15:10,296
and yourself.

172
00:15:10,888 --> 00:15:15,230
You think you've won. But in reality, you're worse than I.

173
00:15:15,311 --> 00:15:16,352
Such nonsense!

174
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:19,379
In your current state, Zhen will never fall for you.

175
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:21,599
She'll hate you instead.

176
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:22,679
Shut up!

177
00:15:47,879 --> 00:15:49,296
If the afterlife does exist,

178
00:15:50,639 --> 00:15:53,695
I hope I won't be born a cripple.

179
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,815
I hope I won't be afflicted with ailments

180
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,056
or need to suffer.

181
00:16:13,039 --> 00:16:17,439
Ji Ya, you've been aiming for some time. You didn't make a single attempt.

182
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,719
Just do it.

183
00:16:18,799 --> 00:16:20,039
Let me aim for a little longer.

184
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:23,760
Ji Ya, it's just a game. You don't need to worry so much.

185
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:25,935
Why don't we consider this as my loss?

186
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,479
No way. Pitch-pot is what I'm best at.

187
00:16:29,559 --> 00:16:31,056
You just picked this up not long ago.

188
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:33,136
I have to defeat you.

189
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:34,360
Fine, then.

190
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:41,656
Ji Ya, you're too competitive and prideful.

191
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:44,815
That'll wear you out, you know?

192
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:47,335
Why must we win all the time?

193
00:17:02,759 --> 00:17:04,456
Now that I think about it,

194
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:08,256
Zhen is right.

195
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:14,135
It's pretty nice to lead a simple life.

196
00:17:14,759 --> 00:17:18,855
I'm different from you. So what if I obtain her body?

197
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:24,124
What I desire is her entire being.

198
00:17:25,160 --> 00:17:26,855
We shall be together forever.

199
00:17:58,240 --> 00:17:59,579
(Ruyi Pavilion)

200
00:17:59,872 --> 00:18:02,727
Before this, Cat Lord wanted the best products from Yuzhen Parlour.

201
00:18:03,055 --> 00:18:04,769
Now, she doesn't even want to pick one when I've delivered them here.

202
00:18:04,793 --> 00:18:07,609
These are the trendiest and best products I have currently.

203
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:13,895
Mr. Mei did delay his return too long.

204
00:18:14,039 --> 00:18:17,615
Seems like Kitty has to head to Quzhou now.

205
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,216
That was an excellent drinking session.

206
00:18:26,759 --> 00:18:27,822
Beauty...

207
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:29,895
Lady Wu Zhen?

208
00:18:31,920 --> 00:18:32,983
What a coincidence.

209
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:36,615
I've heard about it. Commissioner Mei has run away, huh?

210
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,776
If I must say, you should've said yes to me back then.

211
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,216
I do appreciate delicate beauties like you, you know?

212
00:18:44,519 --> 00:18:47,056
I heard that Mr. Mei has run away from his marriage.

213
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:49,679
He didn't show up for half a month.

214
00:18:49,759 --> 00:18:52,496
I wonder if he's afraid of Princess Qing He.

215
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,976
If we compare them, I suppose Young Marquis is better.

216
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:57,720
I like that.

217
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:03,976
Lady Wu, why don't we rekindle our old flame?

218
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:07,776
Sure. Young Marquis, do you want me to kick you again?

219
00:19:09,669 --> 00:19:11,976
Who's that? Let me go!

220
00:19:22,767 --> 00:19:23,839
Young Marquis.

221
00:19:23,920 --> 00:19:25,759
Isn't that Mr. Mei?

222
00:19:25,839 --> 00:19:29,536
That's right. That's Commissioner Mei of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

223
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,456
Everyone, it's my fault for returning late to Chang'an.

224
00:19:35,119 --> 00:19:36,895
I don't mind what you guys say about me.

225
00:19:37,344 --> 00:19:40,344
But I won't allow it if anyone tries to bully Lady Wu Zhen.

226
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:43,039
How dare you offend me? Aren't you afraid...

227
00:19:43,119 --> 00:19:44,119
Not at all.

228
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:46,095
If you're unsatisfied,

229
00:19:46,478 --> 00:19:49,695
you may present a petition to His Majesty and let the world decide.

230
00:19:50,315 --> 00:19:51,380
I only know

231
00:19:51,859 --> 00:19:55,515
that all husbands in the world will protect their wives.

232
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:57,135
Wife, huh?

233
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,736
They're indeed getting married.

234
00:20:00,079 --> 00:20:01,759
Seems like they have a great relationship.

235
00:20:05,000 --> 00:20:06,000
Lady Wu.

236
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:08,600
Something occurred on my way back.

237
00:20:08,709 --> 00:20:10,722
That's why I was late. I...

238
00:20:13,799 --> 00:20:14,799
Lady Wu?

239
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:17,799
Young Marquis, this is...

240
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:25,726
Have you lost your mind?

241
00:20:26,018 --> 00:20:27,178
I need to tell you something.

242
00:20:44,680 --> 00:20:45,855
Young Master, you're back.

243
00:20:53,319 --> 00:20:55,120
Wen Hua, go out and buy some stuff.

244
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,400
I already bought everything we needed. We lack nothing.

245
00:21:00,839 --> 00:21:02,895
Understood. I'll buy extra.

246
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,159
I won't interrupt you two.

247
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:15,895
I was in a hurry just now. Are you hurt?

248
00:21:19,738 --> 00:21:22,395
Sorry. I'm late.

249
00:21:23,534 --> 00:21:25,910
Do you have a partner in Quzhou?

250
00:21:28,160 --> 00:21:29,160
What?

251
00:21:32,039 --> 00:21:34,415
It doesn't take that long to return to Quzhou.

252
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:39,335
Perhaps you have a partner in Quzhou

253
00:21:39,559 --> 00:21:41,439
and you went back to give her an account.

254
00:21:41,519 --> 00:21:43,999
But she refused to accept it and wouldn't allow you to return.

255
00:21:46,039 --> 00:21:48,256
Are you writing a story here?

256
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:50,895
It sounds logical. Everything makes sense, you know?

257
00:21:53,079 --> 00:21:57,335
I swear, you're the only woman I love.

258
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:01,559
Really?

259
00:22:02,759 --> 00:22:04,256
If so, why are you only back now?

260
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:10,296
I miscalculated the journey. That's why I was delayed.

261
00:22:11,839 --> 00:22:12,839
I'm sorry.

262
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,279
Come with me.

263
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,880
Is this your parents' spirit tablet?

264
00:22:35,079 --> 00:22:37,599
When my mother was 16, she fell into the water while traveling.

265
00:22:38,079 --> 00:22:39,615
Luckily, my father rescued her.

266
00:22:40,920 --> 00:22:44,615
They fell in love, but their family didn't acknowledge their relationship.

267
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:51,456
They thought Father was just a normal merchant.

268
00:22:54,119 --> 00:22:59,135
I heard that from Si more or less.

269
00:23:00,519 --> 00:23:02,279
After that, my mother eloped with my father.

270
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,760
Thus, the Mei Residence was born.

271
00:23:05,759 --> 00:23:06,759
They had me as well.

272
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:12,256
The three of us led an ordinary life.

273
00:23:13,599 --> 00:23:14,936
Until 18 years ago.

274
00:23:18,680 --> 00:23:21,855
My parents died during the Divine Fire Chaos.

275
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:25,016
The Mei family sent me to Quzhou.

276
00:23:28,839 --> 00:23:31,496
I never expected to go hungry in summer

277
00:23:33,319 --> 00:23:35,239
and suffer the cold under thin quilts in winter.

278
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:40,680
After that, even if I was fortunate enough to be taken in by Master,

279
00:23:44,119 --> 00:23:46,335
even if I'd witnessed the bustling Chang'an,

280
00:23:48,968 --> 00:23:51,280
I still had no desires

281
00:23:54,094 --> 00:23:55,640
in this world.

282
00:24:06,319 --> 00:24:07,319
Mei Zhu Yu.

283
00:24:10,720 --> 00:24:16,655
I once thought that I would stay distant from the worldly realm forever.

284
00:24:21,000 --> 00:24:22,296
Until I encountered you.

285
00:24:23,119 --> 00:24:24,719
You were the one who dragged me into it.

286
00:24:27,079 --> 00:24:28,335
You're an excellent lady.

287
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,615
How am I excellent?

288
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,175
You're the bravest,

289
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
most determined,

290
00:24:41,240 --> 00:24:42,855
and most outstanding lady I've met.

291
00:24:45,039 --> 00:24:47,719
You're even more outstanding than most of the men I've encountered.

292
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:55,895
I think I'm not good enough for you.

293
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:00,415
I have a cold personality. People hate me as well.

294
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:05,536
But now that I'm lucky to make your acquaintance,

295
00:25:08,319 --> 00:25:09,959
Father and Mother shall be our witnesses.

296
00:25:11,119 --> 00:25:12,799
I'm truly sincere in asking for your hand.

297
00:25:13,759 --> 00:25:16,855
I'm willing to pledge a lifetime with you as we grow old together.

298
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:23,182
Wu Zhen, will you marry me?

299
00:25:34,319 --> 00:25:37,456
Didn't Sister and Brother-in-law already grant us a marriage?

300
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:39,000
Why are you still asking me this?

301
00:25:39,720 --> 00:25:44,095
It's because your will is much more important than the imperial decree.

302
00:25:51,839 --> 00:25:55,135
You are all alone with no family to rely on

303
00:25:55,880 --> 00:26:00,855
while I'm reckless and unruly.

304
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:03,639
Both of us are "outstanding" in our own ways.

305
00:26:04,160 --> 00:26:05,920
Doesn't that make us a match made in heaven?

306
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:17,680
From now on, with me by your side,

307
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:20,736
you may continue to live with ease,

308
00:26:21,373 --> 00:26:22,508
unrestrained,

309
00:26:23,592 --> 00:26:24,729
heedless of convention,

310
00:26:25,559 --> 00:26:26,696
while following your heart.

311
00:26:29,400 --> 00:26:30,696
You're still as free as ever.

312
00:26:32,599 --> 00:26:36,615
But there's one thing. Perhaps you're taking this one day at a time.

313
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:39,862
But I can't.

314
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,895
You were the one who provoked me first.

315
00:26:43,519 --> 00:26:47,536
You caused me to have desires and long for love.

316
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:51,895
Even if, one day,

317
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:54,696
you lost your interest in me,

318
00:26:56,319 --> 00:26:57,319
even if you are annoyed

319
00:26:58,680 --> 00:27:00,160
and are bored by my presence,

320
00:27:05,359 --> 00:27:07,056
you cannot abandon me.

321
00:27:12,480 --> 00:27:13,480
If not...

322
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:17,815
If not, what?

323
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,456
Life is short.

324
00:27:24,400 --> 00:27:25,655
I will never let you go.

325
00:28:22,408 --> 00:28:26,103
My cousin and Lady Wu Zhen are getting closer and closer.

326
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:29,976
Indeed. He's an excellent groom.

327
00:28:30,960 --> 00:28:33,016
She'd better not scare him away.

328
00:28:35,599 --> 00:28:39,026
Sister, seems like you're going to be an aunt in the near future.

329
00:28:39,160 --> 00:28:40,776
Me too.

330
00:28:41,839 --> 00:28:44,439
When it comes to children, one must start with at least a pair.

331
00:28:44,519 --> 00:28:48,615
If it's a boy, he must inherit your family's graceful air.

332
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:52,976
If it's a girl, she must inherit our family's valiant air.

333
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:56,815
But they say that daughters take after their fathers

334
00:28:57,200 --> 00:28:58,976
while sons resemble their mothers.

335
00:28:59,247 --> 00:29:00,680
If

336
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:06,731
They give birth to sons who take after Zhen...

337
00:29:15,359 --> 00:29:19,095
Did you two summon me just to talk about this?

338
00:29:19,359 --> 00:29:22,056
Giving birth to and raising children are very important, you know?

339
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:24,375
Zhen, you're getting married soon.

340
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:26,199
You can't afford to act willfully anymore.

341
00:29:26,759 --> 00:29:29,600
In my opinion, it's too early to talk about kids.

342
00:29:30,079 --> 00:29:33,655
Why don't we decide if we should grant them a huge manor?

343
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:36,359
Your Majesty.

344
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:46,895
Your Majesty, you have to look at the bigger picture.

345
00:29:47,240 --> 00:29:49,776
My father and sister lack nothing.

346
00:29:50,119 --> 00:29:52,959
Why should we grant them a manor when they haven't rendered any merits?

347
00:29:54,920 --> 00:29:56,135
Fine.

348
00:29:56,920 --> 00:29:59,016
She's getting harder and harder to serve.

349
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,575
However, Mr. Mei's residence could be better...

350
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:12,815
Mr. Mei, would you mind if you were to live at Duke Wu's Residence?

351
00:30:13,119 --> 00:30:17,575
People will gossip about him and say that he's a live-in husband.

352
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:21,536
I don't mind. It's fine as long as she's happy.

353
00:30:22,119 --> 00:30:24,615
I don't care about what other people say about me.

354
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,142
But I do.

355
00:30:28,119 --> 00:30:31,736
There are only the two of us. Why should we live in a huge manor?

356
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,320
And, people might badmouth us because of it too.

357
00:30:35,359 --> 00:30:37,815
I think the Mei Residence is good enough.

358
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:42,016
She's the hardest one to serve among us.

359
00:30:43,880 --> 00:30:47,239
Lady Wu Zhen is a princess after all. Of course she's delicate.

360
00:30:47,319 --> 00:30:50,016
Zhu Yu, you'll have to be more understanding.

361
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:51,200
There's no need for that.

362
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,200
She's a great woman.

363
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,016
In my opinion, we should pick an auspicious date early

364
00:31:02,319 --> 00:31:03,736
and hold their wedding.

365
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:08,575
We shouldn't let them wait any longer.

366
00:31:11,799 --> 00:31:12,799
Mr. Mei.

367
00:31:13,640 --> 00:31:17,655
Why don't we admire the view at the Imperial Garden together?

368
00:31:23,839 --> 00:31:24,839
Go now.

369
00:31:30,974 --> 00:31:32,270
Aren't you going to join them?

370
00:31:33,559 --> 00:31:34,959
I don't think I'll be joining them.

371
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,815
I'm sure nothing bad will happen.

372
00:31:41,720 --> 00:31:44,895
Do you know why I brought you out here?

373
00:31:46,240 --> 00:31:49,135
Your Majesty, it's because you're worried about Lady Wu Zhen.

374
00:31:50,519 --> 00:31:51,615
Mr. Mei,

375
00:31:52,160 --> 00:31:57,135
Zhen had a narrow escape from death before.

376
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,375
Your Majesty, are you referring to the incident 18 years ago?

377
00:32:05,559 --> 00:32:06,776
Look at the tiny butterflies.

378
00:32:09,596 --> 00:32:12,652
- Look! They sell candy figures! - There?

379
00:32:13,439 --> 00:32:14,559
I want a candy figure.

380
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,815
- Okay. - Take a look.

381
00:32:16,680 --> 00:32:18,080
Mister, one candy figure, please.

382
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,335
All right. Please pick one.

383
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:30,400
Run!

384
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:33,160
Divine fire?

385
00:32:33,559 --> 00:32:35,536
Why is it happening during winter?

386
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,119
Lady Wu Zhen?

387
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:39,640
Lady Wu Zhen?

388
00:32:39,759 --> 00:32:40,759
Lady Wu Zhen!

389
00:32:42,680 --> 00:32:43,680
Lady Wu Zhen!

390
00:32:44,119 --> 00:32:45,655
Father!

391
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,855
Sister!

392
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:01,135
That's right. She was born with a weak constitution.

393
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,815
She had a close shave

394
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:06,696
on New Year's Eve 18 years ago.

395
00:33:07,400 --> 00:33:09,400
She was lucky enough to be blessed by the heavens.

396
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:11,456
That's how she was able to recover.

397
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:16,056
Although her health improved gradually,

398
00:33:17,160 --> 00:33:19,696
she had a complete change of personality.

399
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,696
People say that she's willful and unruly.

400
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:29,976
But in my eyes, she's always hiding something beneath the surface.

401
00:33:31,845 --> 00:33:34,941
Even Father and I couldn't figure it out.

402
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:39,655
Do you think there are unresolved issues in her heart?

403
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:43,640
I don't know.

404
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:48,976
All these years, she has always returned late.

405
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:50,999
She always had a worried look on her face.

406
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:54,056
Sometimes, she even came back injured.

407
00:33:55,920 --> 00:33:59,936
But she told us nothing at all.

408
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,376
I know I'm strict with her.

409
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:17,056
In reality, I just want her to lead a better life.

410
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:22,936
Your Majesty, Wu Zhen and I are deeply in love.

411
00:34:24,559 --> 00:34:26,736
I believe that she's not unruly and willful,

412
00:34:26,816 --> 00:34:28,336
unlike what other people think of her.

413
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:31,896
She's kind, intelligent, and decisive.

414
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:36,175
She's the most radiant person I've ever seen.

415
00:34:37,079 --> 00:34:39,416
I'm truly fortunate to be able to stay by her side.

416
00:34:41,639 --> 00:34:42,816
Excellent.

417
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,615
Since this is the marriage she wants,

418
00:34:46,280 --> 00:34:48,896
Father and I can finally rest at ease.

419
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,695
Our mother passed away at an early age.

420
00:34:56,679 --> 00:34:59,816
Our father has a childish personality.

421
00:35:00,639 --> 00:35:02,199
It's inconvenient for me to do anything

422
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:07,135
within the deep confines of the palace.

423
00:35:15,559 --> 00:35:18,896
Mr. Mei, she's my only sister.

424
00:35:19,840 --> 00:35:23,655
From now on, I'll entrust her to you.

425
00:35:24,840 --> 00:35:28,735
I hope you can resolve her worries for her.

426
00:35:30,599 --> 00:35:35,856
I hope you'll lead a safe and peaceful life with her.

427
00:35:39,360 --> 00:35:42,255
I will never let her down, even in death.

428
00:35:47,039 --> 00:35:49,976
It's getting late. You should look for Zhen.

429
00:35:50,559 --> 00:35:51,559
Yes, Your Majesty.

430
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:19,496
Father, you can rest at ease now, right?

431
00:36:29,523 --> 00:36:33,458
(Duke Wu's Residence)

432
00:36:52,800 --> 00:36:53,800
What is this?

433
00:36:54,639 --> 00:36:55,639
Is it food?

434
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,120
It's your betrothal gift, a goose.

435
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:19,135
Excellent!

436
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,735
Sinister Lord Infant, thank you for remembering me.

437
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:48,175
I've served you once after all.

438
00:37:48,679 --> 00:37:53,615
Now that I think about it, I shouldn't have refused your goodwill.

439
00:38:20,719 --> 00:38:25,695
I promised that I would locate your core, restore your body,

440
00:38:25,960 --> 00:38:28,496
and rebuild our great empire.

441
00:39:04,920 --> 00:39:07,079
How is it?

442
00:39:07,222 --> 00:39:10,145
In two more hours, we can rebuild Chang'an

443
00:39:10,225 --> 00:39:12,358
after the demonic fire has been extinguished.

444
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:15,040
The Mortal Realm and the Demon Realm will be merged.

445
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:17,175
The Mortal Realm will be rebuilt.

446
00:39:18,119 --> 00:39:20,095
Naturally, you shall be our ruler.

447
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:36,255
I'll surely eradicate Chang'an.

448
00:39:36,519 --> 00:39:38,615
By then, you can take over the world all you want.

449
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:40,936
She's the only one I desire.

450
00:40:47,320 --> 00:40:50,095
Zhen, you're the only one I desire.

451
00:40:51,000 --> 00:40:55,295
All those around you, they are unnecessary.

452
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,302
So filthy.

453
00:41:36,719 --> 00:41:39,536
Elder Gray, how have you been?

454
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:43,440
Don't be scared.

455
00:41:44,199 --> 00:41:45,856
I'm here to negotiate a deal with you.

456
00:41:54,599 --> 00:41:56,816
The Bai Sect has never been good at handling affairs.

457
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:00,135
I merely need to lift a finger to obtain your demonic core.

458
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,320
What do you think?

459
00:42:03,087 --> 00:42:07,824
Will you break free from the plight of ordinary rats and work for me?

460
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:23,200
Lord Shu.
