1
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,000
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 27)

3
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:27,942
Sleep early.

4
00:02:55,871 --> 00:02:57,528
(There are many guests tonight)

5
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,136
(and it's a night when lanterns are lit.)

6
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:01,695
(It's full of people)

7
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,095
(and confusing.)

8
00:03:03,199 --> 00:03:05,896
(This will be a good time and place for demons to hide.)

9
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:12,736
Demonic matters seldom happen in Chang'an.

10
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,896
However, you are

11
00:03:15,639 --> 00:03:18,095
very calm about this, Lady Wu Zhen.

12
00:03:23,245 --> 00:03:24,885
- Why are you here? - Why are you here?

13
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:29,440
I wanted to return to the Arcane Appraisal Bureau

14
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:31,456
but I heard the victim wasn't doing so well.

15
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,695
I just found out about this

16
00:03:34,199 --> 00:03:36,896
and came here on His Majesty's orders to check on the victim.

17
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:39,063
I see.

18
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,416
What are you doing here then, Lady Wu Zhen?

19
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,815
You didn't come to meet me.

20
00:03:49,039 --> 00:03:50,176
I was too free

21
00:03:50,639 --> 00:03:51,975
so I came to join in the fun.

22
00:03:57,240 --> 00:04:00,535
People call her willful.

23
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:02,942
But in my opinion,

24
00:04:03,919 --> 00:04:06,456
she has always had something on her mind.

25
00:04:08,039 --> 00:04:09,416
Even Father and I

26
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,183
couldn't understand her.

27
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:13,463
All these years,

28
00:04:14,039 --> 00:04:15,935
I've seen her return at night

29
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,656
laden with worries.

30
00:04:18,319 --> 00:04:20,736
Sometimes, she was even wounded.

31
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:23,702
However,

32
00:04:24,439 --> 00:04:26,575
she said nothing about this.

33
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:35,133
Can you

34
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,736
pick me up after work tomorrow?

35
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:42,863
Sure.

36
00:04:56,040 --> 00:05:00,217
(Arcane Appraisal Bureau)

37
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,262
Commissioner Mei.

38
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:20,382
What is it?

39
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:22,455
It's time to leave work.

40
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:24,183
All of you may go back.

41
00:05:24,399 --> 00:05:26,495
I still need to go through some documents.

42
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,695
Everyone is here.

43
00:05:40,399 --> 00:05:41,462
Let's begin.

44
00:05:43,079 --> 00:05:45,199
Sect Leader. Shuang Jiang and Zhu Yu aren't here yet.

45
00:05:45,279 --> 00:05:46,359
Why don't we wait for them?

46
00:05:46,759 --> 00:05:50,176
What? Can't we do this without Mei Zhu Yu?

47
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,776
Must we wait for him?

48
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:53,559
I did not mean that.

49
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:56,119
He has to deal with matters at the Arcane Appraisal Bureau

50
00:05:56,199 --> 00:05:57,400
and he is married now.

51
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,736
It is normal for him to be busy.

52
00:05:59,959 --> 00:06:01,656
We won't trouble him anymore.

53
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:04,616
As for Shuang Jiang...

54
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:07,303
With him around,

55
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:09,736
not only is he unable to help us,

56
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:12,480
but we also need to clean up his mess.

57
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:14,935
Enough. Chi Hua, go ahead.

58
00:06:15,079 --> 00:06:16,255
What should we do later?

59
00:06:21,480 --> 00:06:22,879
I've investigated the area.

60
00:06:22,959 --> 00:06:24,536
No one walks past this place when it's dark.

61
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:26,000
It's suitable for us to take action.

62
00:06:26,052 --> 00:06:28,456
We can set up four eyes of arrays at North, South, East and West

63
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:30,575
to tear the center barrier of the ruined temple.

64
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:34,935
I came up with a majestic name for this array.

65
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,736
I call it the Four-Winds Grand Array.

66
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,815
Four eyes of the arrays.

67
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:46,559
The four of us

68
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:47,976
can work together.

69
00:06:48,680 --> 00:06:49,743
Good.

70
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,600
Get ready.

71
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:53,056
We'll act at night.

72
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,223
Yes.

73
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:19,623
Mr. Mei.

74
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:22,815
Are you done with work? I'm here to pick you up.

75
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:34,983
Stay away!

76
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:42,983
What's wrong?

77
00:07:51,959 --> 00:07:53,976
You can ask the person to stand in this formation.

78
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:56,216
Nothing will happen to an ordinary person.

79
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,695
However, a demon

80
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,056
will show its true self in this courtyard.

81
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,623
It's nothing.

82
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:09,335
Let's go home.

83
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:29,582
Sorry.

84
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:35,702
It's all right.

85
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,176
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau isn't very sturdy.

86
00:08:39,720 --> 00:08:41,760
I'll get someone to repair it again when I go back.

87
00:08:45,879 --> 00:08:46,942
Let's go home.

88
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:49,303
All right.

89
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:11,360
Lady Hu Zhu, is this enough?

90
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,503
There's more.

91
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,063
It's enough.

92
00:10:14,279 --> 00:10:16,296
I'll give you a day off tomorrow.

93
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,136
Next, it all depends on Zhu Ying and Ling Xiao.

94
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:35,503
How strange.

95
00:10:36,440 --> 00:10:38,855
I smelled it here.

96
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:42,095
Why isn't there anyone here?

97
00:10:58,384 --> 00:10:59,439
What's wrong?

98
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:01,536
Our plan has been exposed

99
00:11:01,879 --> 00:11:02,975
and we got ambushed.

100
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:07,896
If Shuang Jiang hadn't rushed here with the horse carriage,

101
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:11,016
the smell on us

102
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:13,975
would attract too much attention.

103
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:19,935
Shuang Jiang, you've contributed a lot.

104
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:21,543
It wasn't me.

105
00:11:22,159 --> 00:11:23,160
What do you mean?

106
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:25,120
It was Brother Mei who told me to wait for you.

107
00:11:25,679 --> 00:11:26,742
That's right.

108
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:33,296
Brother Mei has created this Evil-warding Talisman recently.

109
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,839
He wanted to thank Brother Chi Hua

110
00:11:34,919 --> 00:11:36,416
for repairing the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

111
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:38,975
He is afraid that Demon City might trace all of you.

112
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,256
Bring it with you

113
00:11:40,519 --> 00:11:41,975
to avoid surveillance from demons.

114
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:43,536
It can also

115
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:45,496
hide the scent.

116
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:50,263
I must say.

117
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:53,256
It's unfortunate for Zhu Yu to leave Changxi Palace.

118
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:54,742
Unfortunate?

119
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:56,799
Not at all.

120
00:11:56,879 --> 00:11:58,239
Giving us a talisman means nothing

121
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:00,120
since he is hiding

122
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,455
and letting us suffer here.

123
00:12:02,472 --> 00:12:04,168
He left Changxi Palace.

124
00:12:04,759 --> 00:12:06,503
- Why would he save... - Enough.

125
00:12:06,879 --> 00:12:08,975
Forget about the fact that he left Changxi Palace.

126
00:12:09,919 --> 00:12:11,815
Even Master said

127
00:12:13,159 --> 00:12:15,735
that Mei Zhu Yu was a worldly

128
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,215
and ordinary person.

129
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,536
We shouldn't ask too much of him.

130
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:33,783
What is this?

131
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:35,575
An address given by Brother Mei.

132
00:12:35,672 --> 00:12:38,272
A residence in the Southeast that's three li outside of the city.

133
00:12:53,679 --> 00:12:55,959
When I think about the Celestial Masters being hated,

134
00:12:56,039 --> 00:12:57,615
I feel incredibly happy.

135
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,416
They even infiltrated Demon City.

136
00:12:59,497 --> 00:13:00,815
They deserve to sleep on the streets.

137
00:13:00,839 --> 00:13:02,156
Let's see how they are going to hide.

138
00:13:02,180 --> 00:13:03,696
It's too early to be happy.

139
00:13:04,200 --> 00:13:06,256
I asked Zhu Ying and Ling Xiao

140
00:13:06,337 --> 00:13:07,873
to search all over Chang'an.

141
00:13:07,954 --> 00:13:10,728
- They didn't find any traces of Celestial Masters. - They didn't?

142
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:12,167
How so?

143
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:16,335
We thought the barrier was covered by Xiang's bad luck.

144
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,056
Once they caught it, they'd be easy to trace.

145
00:13:19,759 --> 00:13:23,016
I didn't expect the Celestial Masters to be so troublesome.

146
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,896
We need to think of another way.

147
00:13:25,159 --> 00:13:26,199
Leave this matter alone.

148
00:13:26,279 --> 00:13:27,896
I'll deal with the rest.

149
00:13:28,279 --> 00:13:29,342
Why?

150
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:30,695
If you have time,

151
00:13:30,799 --> 00:13:33,256
you should think about becoming a complete demon.

152
00:13:33,919 --> 00:13:36,855
I heard the Skin Shop has found you a new skin.

153
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:39,655
You can use it after you come out of cultivation a century later.

154
00:13:39,679 --> 00:13:41,416
You'll be busy in the next few days.

155
00:13:42,080 --> 00:13:43,143
What?

156
00:13:43,240 --> 00:13:44,656
Don't you know about this?

157
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,296
I heard this skin of yours

158
00:13:47,399 --> 00:13:49,536
cannot handle the power of a complete demon.

159
00:13:50,278 --> 00:13:51,735
If you want to become a complete demon,

160
00:13:51,759 --> 00:13:53,056
I'm afraid you must abandon it.

161
00:14:12,799 --> 00:14:13,896
Cat Lord.

162
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:15,503
Leave.

163
00:14:16,279 --> 00:14:17,342
Yes.

164
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:25,215
How do you know that I'll be here?

165
00:14:27,039 --> 00:14:28,102
My spring

166
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,855
is ready for you all day long.

167
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:36,656
How meticulous.

168
00:14:38,519 --> 00:14:40,575
Did you go to the Skin Shop

169
00:14:41,799 --> 00:14:43,656
to prepare a new skin for me?

170
00:14:44,039 --> 00:14:46,400
Of course, I'll prepare everything for you.

171
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:47,880
Why didn't you tell me

172
00:14:47,960 --> 00:14:49,217
that I must cultivate in seclusion

173
00:14:49,241 --> 00:14:50,881
for a century to become a complete demon?

174
00:14:54,080 --> 00:14:55,735
If you want to become a complete demon,

175
00:14:55,960 --> 00:14:57,455
of course you must reshape your body.

176
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,455
Don't you know that, Zhen?

177
00:15:05,879 --> 00:15:08,335
You didn't tell me about it at all.

178
00:15:15,279 --> 00:15:16,776
There's nothing to miss

179
00:15:16,879 --> 00:15:18,776
about things in the mortal world.

180
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:23,735
Our common goal for the last 18 years has been to become a demon.

181
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,136
Now that your body is in this state,

182
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:27,776
telling you or not

183
00:15:28,159 --> 00:15:29,335
makes no difference.

184
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:31,663
Are you going to

185
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:34,000
sacrifice your life

186
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,335
for something so trivial?

187
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:40,536
Know this.

188
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,215
You are a demon.

189
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,183
Humans

190
00:15:46,720 --> 00:15:49,536
will grow old, die, and suffer.

191
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,360
They can't bear

192
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:53,855
any of the sufferings and they can't stop it from happening.

193
00:15:56,440 --> 00:15:58,056
Who can you even protect?

194
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:01,663
Your father?

195
00:16:02,960 --> 00:16:04,023
Your sister?

196
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:07,656
Or Mei Zhu Yu?

197
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,376
18 years ago,

198
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:17,159
both of you were already on different paths.

199
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:19,656
This is a fixed ending.

200
00:16:20,360 --> 00:16:22,455
Whether it happens early or late

201
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:24,855
makes no difference.

202
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:29,656
As the lord of the demons,

203
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:31,880
you shouldn't keep

204
00:16:31,960 --> 00:16:33,575
so many useless people in your heart.

205
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:12,415
It is just a broken soul.

206
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:14,575
No matter how respectful you are to it,

207
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:16,696
it still won't understand.

208
00:17:22,920 --> 00:17:26,575
The Sinister Lord Infant is ambitious

209
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:28,135
has remarkable aspirations.

210
00:17:28,920 --> 00:17:32,056
No other being can surpass it.

211
00:17:33,359 --> 00:17:36,335
I'm showing respect to the intention.

212
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:38,622
Enough.

213
00:17:38,880 --> 00:17:40,240
You've already paid your respects.

214
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,422
If you have nothing else,

215
00:17:42,039 --> 00:17:43,135
you may leave.

216
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,016
I don't like other people here.

217
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:52,256
Now that Elder Chang Ming has left the mountain,

218
00:17:52,839 --> 00:17:53,902
what do you plan to do

219
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:56,696
after this, Lord Shu?

220
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,135
If he wants to enter Demon City,

221
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:02,496
I will help him.

222
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:07,216
Lord Shu, it's not that difficult

223
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,976
to let someone into Demon City.

224
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:15,536
No. I don't like an answer that is within expectations.

225
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:20,056
What I want is two sides on the verge

226
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:21,895
of a war

227
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:23,783
and have a battle

228
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,895
until one side falls.

229
00:18:29,279 --> 00:18:32,560
Lord Shu, I wonder if you are doing this

230
00:18:32,640 --> 00:18:34,936
for your own purpose or our ambition?

231
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,960
Doing it for my own purpose

232
00:18:39,559 --> 00:18:40,815
is doing it for you

233
00:18:42,000 --> 00:18:43,175
and your ambition.

234
00:19:21,799 --> 00:19:22,862
What are you two doing?

235
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:24,976
Great timing. Come and sit.

236
00:19:25,599 --> 00:19:26,976
The meat will be ready soon.

237
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,615
Don't worry. It's not a mammal.

238
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,600
Why do you feel like eating meat all of a sudden?

239
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,920
I remember

240
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,776
how my family would grill meat in the winter when I was young.

241
00:19:57,519 --> 00:19:58,815
Grilling meat as a family.

242
00:20:00,519 --> 00:20:01,582
How nice.

243
00:20:04,279 --> 00:20:05,736
We will grill meat

244
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:07,736
every winter from now on.

245
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:09,456
You can ask your father

246
00:20:09,599 --> 00:20:11,736
to try my cooking. How's that?

247
00:20:21,839 --> 00:20:22,902
Mr. Mei.

248
00:20:23,519 --> 00:20:24,582
What's wrong?

249
00:20:33,279 --> 00:20:34,575
Just wait. It'll be done soon.

250
00:20:37,559 --> 00:20:38,736
The skewers smell nice.

251
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,296
Of course.

252
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:30,783
Don't worry.

253
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:32,655
This residence is remote.

254
00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:34,999
I also put on Brother Mei's talisman all over the place.

255
00:21:35,240 --> 00:21:36,360
The demons

256
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:37,479
will not find this place.

257
00:21:37,559 --> 00:21:38,696
Staying anywhere is the same.

258
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:40,976
Cultivators don't care about these things.

259
00:21:41,759 --> 00:21:43,016
It's the smell.

260
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,415
What a pity that my Four-Winds Grand Array

261
00:21:50,920 --> 00:21:52,855
failed before it activated.

262
00:21:53,160 --> 00:21:55,840
We were attacked by the bad luck

263
00:21:55,920 --> 00:21:57,039
and got the smell on us.

264
00:21:57,119 --> 00:21:59,400
It'll take two or three days for the smell to leave.

265
00:21:59,480 --> 00:22:02,439
What else? I'm sure the demons were taking revenge.

266
00:22:02,519 --> 00:22:04,256
That means our method is correct.

267
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,575
This move can open the Demon City barrier.

268
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:07,880
We should use this momentum

269
00:22:07,960 --> 00:22:09,160
to attack Demon City.

270
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:10,400
Brother Mei said

271
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:12,696
that if Brother Chi Hua could enter Demon City,

272
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:15,160
he wouldn't be able to meet us anymore now.

273
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:16,536
He left the sect voluntarily

274
00:22:16,799 --> 00:22:18,296
and kept defending Demon City.

275
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:20,496
I'm sure he has already colluded with the demons.

276
00:22:21,599 --> 00:22:22,662
That's impossible.

277
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:25,296
Anyone can collude with the demons but not Brother Mei.

278
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,719
He has to avenge his parents.

279
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:31,440
He has a wife now and has probably become a coward.

280
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:32,696
Aren't you a coward yourself?

281
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:36,399
- Why don't you sacrifice yourself and go to the Demon City alone? - You!

282
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:37,983
- Shuang Jiang! - Enough.

283
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:43,655
I'm sure he is dying to get rid of the demons.

284
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:48,696
Don't let these things ruin our relationship.

285
00:22:50,039 --> 00:22:51,335
I only know

286
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,655
that we might not be here

287
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,279
if it weren't for Brother Mei.

288
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:57,135
So, he knew

289
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:59,456
that we would fail.

290
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:05,696
Brother Mei said he guessed we would fail.

291
00:23:05,920 --> 00:23:07,239
He asked me to tell all of you

292
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:09,736
to use his method if we want to succeed.

293
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,662
All of you should consider it.

294
00:23:16,319 --> 00:23:17,496
Where are you going?

295
00:23:20,039 --> 00:23:21,175
Aren't you going to stay?

296
00:23:21,440 --> 00:23:23,375
Brother Mei prepared a place for me.

297
00:23:23,599 --> 00:23:24,662
Moreover,

298
00:23:25,519 --> 00:23:26,736
I can't stand the smell.

299
00:23:31,816 --> 00:23:33,712
(He wanted us to fail)

300
00:23:34,359 --> 00:23:36,056
(so we would obey him.)

301
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,855
(How clever.)

302
00:23:46,969 --> 00:23:49,144
I can't catch Fu Gui but I can catch you!

303
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:50,303
Stop!

304
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,456
Stop!

305
00:23:54,319 --> 00:23:55,382
Stop!

306
00:23:55,559 --> 00:23:56,655
Stop!

307
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,095
Stop!

308
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:03,920
I dare you to run again!

309
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,121
If you run again, I'll make you

310
00:24:06,201 --> 00:24:07,655
into a variety of goose dishes!

311
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:11,296
You are a man but you always bully the weak.

312
00:24:11,759 --> 00:24:13,463
Are you saying that I bullied it?

313
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,895
Lady Wu Zhen treats it like her son.

314
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,429
Him?

315
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:22,662
Lady Wu Zhen's son?

316
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:24,976
Lady Wu Zhen's son is difficult!

317
00:24:29,519 --> 00:24:30,582
Where are you going?

318
00:24:31,839 --> 00:24:34,696
I'm going to wake Lady Wu Zhen and Mr. Mei up.

319
00:24:34,920 --> 00:24:37,256
Don't they know what time it is?

320
00:24:37,400 --> 00:24:38,463
That's...

321
00:24:39,839 --> 00:24:40,902
Wait.

322
00:24:41,920 --> 00:24:44,175
Both of them have been going out all day

323
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:46,256
and they slept at midnight yesterday.

324
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:48,360
If you disturb their sleep,

325
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,800
you'll be in trouble.

326
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:51,095
Isn't that annoying?

327
00:24:52,440 --> 00:24:53,736
You are right.

328
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:56,543
Then,

329
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:57,983
you can wake them up.

330
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,063
Why?

331
00:25:00,185 --> 00:25:02,160
- I'm not going. - Go.

332
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:04,216
No. I'm not going.

333
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:07,680
- Go. - I'm not going.

334
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,840
No. I'm not going.

335
00:25:08,920 --> 00:25:10,640
- Wake them up. - Help!

336
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,239
- Wake them up. - No!

337
00:25:12,319 --> 00:25:14,095
Stop it. Quiet.

338
00:26:03,240 --> 00:26:05,000
Your aunt's family has returned to Chang'an.

339
00:26:05,359 --> 00:26:07,095
There's a banquet at Duke Wu's Residence.

340
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:09,102
I know.

341
00:26:09,759 --> 00:26:10,936
There's no rush.

342
00:27:48,920 --> 00:27:49,983
Mei Si!

343
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:52,063
Mei Si!

344
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:56,575
You are here.

345
00:27:58,319 --> 00:27:59,415
Why are you here?

346
00:27:59,519 --> 00:28:00,696
What are you talking about?

347
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:03,039
I rushed here to see you

348
00:28:03,119 --> 00:28:05,095
once I get off work.

349
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:08,095
Recently, I heard

350
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:12,496
you did something very satisfying.

351
00:28:13,519 --> 00:28:15,135
What a surprise.

352
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,360
You actually rejected Lady Liu's marriage.

353
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:19,776
You are my buddy indeed.

354
00:28:19,880 --> 00:28:21,575
Well done for rejecting the marriage.

355
00:28:22,160 --> 00:28:23,223
Good job.

356
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:26,696
Si, there's nothing to worry.

357
00:28:27,200 --> 00:28:28,776
She's just a woman.

358
00:28:29,334 --> 00:28:32,031
Lady Wu Zhen is married now.

359
00:28:32,640 --> 00:28:35,080
I don't need to introduce her eight men every year.

360
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:37,640
I've decided to do my best for you.

361
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,360
I'll introduce you to 18 women every year.

362
00:28:40,440 --> 00:28:41,536
I'll surely help you

363
00:28:42,645 --> 00:28:44,334
find someone you're satisfied with.

364
00:28:45,772 --> 00:28:47,216
- No... - Don't need to thank me.

365
00:28:49,039 --> 00:28:52,815
I picked these women in the last two days.

366
00:28:53,720 --> 00:28:56,239
They look different and have various styles.

367
00:28:56,319 --> 00:28:57,639
You can find everything you want.

368
00:29:00,079 --> 00:29:01,615
The Protector General's sister.

369
00:29:02,359 --> 00:29:04,560
She's vigorous, bold,

370
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,976
and passionate.

371
00:29:06,400 --> 00:29:07,463
Are you satisfied?

372
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,142
Passionate indeed.

373
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,800
I met her once.

374
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:14,895
She kept talking and I couldn't even interrupt.

375
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:17,463
I think

376
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,976
I still prefer someone who is reserved and cool.

377
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:24,023
I do.

378
00:29:24,160 --> 00:29:26,135
The Crown Prince's teacher's niece.

379
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,840
She's famous for being reserved.

380
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,840
She fell ill and became mute when she was young.

381
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:32,655
Is that cool enough?

382
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:35,175
This is too cool.

383
00:29:36,079 --> 00:29:37,335
I...

384
00:29:37,839 --> 00:29:39,256
You have so many requests.

385
00:29:39,519 --> 00:29:40,800
A slim body

386
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:42,375
and cool temperament.

387
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:45,216
Speaks slowly and gently

388
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,536
but a mighty figure in truth.

389
00:29:52,519 --> 00:29:55,615
Why do I feel like I know someone like that?

390
00:29:58,400 --> 00:29:59,655
Where is she?

391
00:30:09,559 --> 00:30:12,415
Aren't you still talking about her?

392
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,358
(Duke Wu's Residence)

393
00:30:21,759 --> 00:30:24,175
Last time we had so many people around

394
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:29,736
was the day Zhen got married.

395
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:32,503
Yes.

396
00:30:33,839 --> 00:30:37,456
Unfortunately, I wasn't healthy back then

397
00:30:37,559 --> 00:30:39,415
and I departed late.

398
00:30:39,640 --> 00:30:41,615
I couldn't make it to Zhen's wedding.

399
00:30:42,359 --> 00:30:43,479
It's all right.

400
00:30:43,559 --> 00:30:45,736
Your health is more important.

401
00:30:46,079 --> 00:30:47,216
Yes.

402
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:49,479
All of you came back at the right time.

403
00:30:49,559 --> 00:30:52,296
This season is good in Chang'an.

404
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:54,582
- Yes. - Come!

405
00:30:56,079 --> 00:30:59,056
Let's have a drink together.

406
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,976
Cheers.

407
00:31:07,400 --> 00:31:08,463
Son-in-law.

408
00:31:09,359 --> 00:31:10,456
You should

409
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,936
make a toast to your aunt.

410
00:31:22,160 --> 00:31:23,223
Aunt,

411
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:24,760
let me make a toast to you.

412
00:31:38,519 --> 00:31:41,135
Don't worry. I understand.

413
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,216
It's a fruit drink.

414
00:31:46,160 --> 00:31:47,776
A toast to you, Aunt.

415
00:31:55,880 --> 00:31:58,936
Not bad. This kid is a sensible one.

416
00:32:00,599 --> 00:32:01,662
He's sensible.

417
00:32:03,839 --> 00:32:07,415
Ling Xiao and the rest are still searching for the Celestial Masters.

418
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,639
If they vanish after this, we'll forget about it.

419
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:13,146
However, if they cause trouble again,

420
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,536
we'll fight them to the death.

421
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:19,536
Don't worry. They won't get a chance.

422
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,719
I heard

423
00:32:23,799 --> 00:32:27,016
you've been acting intimate with your man recently.

424
00:32:28,240 --> 00:32:30,256
You don't even try to avoid doing it in public.

425
00:32:31,359 --> 00:32:32,422
What?

426
00:32:32,680 --> 00:32:35,135
Are you feeling reluctant because you are leaving?

427
00:32:39,149 --> 00:32:41,045
I heard

428
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:44,080
Minister Liu wanted to help you find a new man after Si rejected you.

429
00:32:45,640 --> 00:32:46,703
Enough.

430
00:32:48,160 --> 00:32:50,016
Both of us were single

431
00:32:50,119 --> 00:32:51,976
in Chang'an in the beginning.

432
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,496
I had a buddy at least.

433
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:55,456
Now that you are married

434
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,976
and everyone knows you are living a good life,

435
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:00,895
That old man couldn't help but ask me.

436
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:02,622
What did he ask you?

437
00:33:02,799 --> 00:33:06,175
He said I didn't like Mei Si

438
00:33:07,559 --> 00:33:10,175
and asked me if I liked someone like Mr. Mei.

439
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,439
I'm afraid there's not another Mei Zhu Yu

440
00:33:14,519 --> 00:33:16,615
in Chang'an.

441
00:33:17,480 --> 00:33:18,976
Minister Liu has good taste.

442
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:21,736
How did you answer him?

443
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:23,543
I don't like him.

444
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,759
Didn't he ask you what your type was?

445
00:33:26,839 --> 00:33:27,902
He did.

446
00:33:28,599 --> 00:33:31,335
I said if Wu Zhen were a man,

447
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:33,095
I would like that.

448
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:38,095
You think really highly of me.

449
00:33:40,599 --> 00:33:43,456
Your eldest cousin is also capable.

450
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:45,015
There are many incidents at the border.

451
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:49,615
You might not see him in three to five years usually.

452
00:33:50,279 --> 00:33:51,999
Cousin, a toast to you.

453
00:33:52,079 --> 00:33:53,895
Cheers.

454
00:33:59,480 --> 00:34:00,543
Miss Zhen.

455
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,543
Is your back hurting?

456
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:08,023
What's wrong?

457
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:09,856
Even the fruit drink is bad?

458
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:11,662
No, Miss Zhen.

459
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:14,255
I'm just being considerate.

460
00:34:14,559 --> 00:34:16,496
Should I get a physician?

461
00:34:43,280 --> 00:34:45,056
Be careful you don't fall.

462
00:34:49,119 --> 00:34:50,615
Mr. Mei

463
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:52,496
seems considerate in the day

464
00:34:53,639 --> 00:34:54,816
but he's also a brute

465
00:34:55,039 --> 00:34:56,936
at night.

466
00:35:00,159 --> 00:35:02,095
Who told you it was only at night?

467
00:35:10,159 --> 00:35:12,456
Why are you still spending time with me then?

468
00:35:12,639 --> 00:35:14,295
Where's your man?

469
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,135
You should go and find him.

470
00:35:16,428 --> 00:35:19,444
He's saying that the women and children are too noisy

471
00:35:20,079 --> 00:35:21,496
and went to the quieter backyard.

472
00:35:21,577 --> 00:35:23,097
I don't want to play with you anymore!

473
00:35:23,400 --> 00:35:24,775
Me too!

474
00:35:28,719 --> 00:35:29,856
It's very noisy indeed.

475
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:36,016
There are many people today. Don't cry.

476
00:35:36,440 --> 00:35:40,056
No!

477
00:35:41,159 --> 00:35:43,856
Stop crying. Don't cry.

478
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:47,681
Stop crying! Come back!

479
00:35:47,773 --> 00:35:49,107
- No! - Stop crying!

480
00:35:49,199 --> 00:35:50,456
Don't cry!

481
00:35:52,199 --> 00:35:53,262
You...

482
00:35:55,800 --> 00:35:56,863
Seriously.

483
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,896
Sorry.

484
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:01,400
Our child likes to bully others.

485
00:36:01,480 --> 00:36:02,880
He's a born bully.

486
00:36:02,960 --> 00:36:04,615
I've caused both of you trouble.

487
00:36:04,719 --> 00:36:05,976
I'll go look for him.

488
00:36:17,519 --> 00:36:19,079
I want to go home!

489
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:21,135
I want to go home!

490
00:36:23,039 --> 00:36:25,896
I want to go home!

491
00:36:26,719 --> 00:36:28,336
I want to go home!

492
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,416
Are you Cousin's son?

493
00:36:32,239 --> 00:36:35,056
I want to go home!

494
00:36:37,559 --> 00:36:40,215
I want to go home!

495
00:37:11,280 --> 00:37:12,536
Is that my son?

496
00:37:13,239 --> 00:37:14,615
He's your son.

497
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,463
Really?

498
00:37:17,199 --> 00:37:19,936
Mr. Mei is good at educating children?

499
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:21,255
How rare.

500
00:37:22,039 --> 00:37:23,280
How did he do it?

501
00:37:23,360 --> 00:37:24,400
I don't know.

502
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:26,056
This is amazing.

503
00:37:26,400 --> 00:37:27,463
Exactly.

504
00:37:34,239 --> 00:37:35,536
What a surprise.

505
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,655
A young man like him is actually good at educating children.

506
00:37:40,159 --> 00:37:43,575
It seems like Mr. Mei will become a good father.

507
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,662
What's wrong?

508
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,863
I thought

509
00:38:18,079 --> 00:38:20,416
I'll be satisfied by experiencing this once.

510
00:38:22,840 --> 00:38:23,936
However,

511
00:38:26,639 --> 00:38:28,376
the human heart is greedy.

512
00:38:35,480 --> 00:38:36,543
Serpent,

513
00:38:41,119 --> 00:38:42,376
I regret it.

514
00:39:05,039 --> 00:39:06,376
Delay and reconsider it?

515
00:39:07,000 --> 00:39:08,496
Did she say that?

516
00:39:10,199 --> 00:39:12,255
After considering it for days,

517
00:39:12,639 --> 00:39:14,536
she has decided to postpone it.

518
00:39:15,800 --> 00:39:17,560
I've been working hard with her for 18 years

519
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:19,735
to become a complete demon

520
00:39:19,960 --> 00:39:22,536
but she actually wants to delay it.

521
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,215
It's reasonable for her to do it.

522
00:39:29,559 --> 00:39:31,360
Before knowing

523
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:32,998
what's wrong with her body,

524
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,816
she can't be gambling with her life.

525
00:39:37,000 --> 00:39:38,135
Ridiculous.

526
00:39:38,981 --> 00:39:40,501
- I'll go and find her. - Wu Zi Shu.

527
00:39:42,434 --> 00:39:45,529
Wu Zi Shu, I don't care what you think.

528
00:39:45,920 --> 00:39:47,559
However, she still has

529
00:39:47,639 --> 00:39:49,295
a few decades to live as Wu Zhen.

530
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:51,496
She still has her life.

531
00:39:52,119 --> 00:39:54,735
This is very precious to her.

532
00:39:55,679 --> 00:39:56,742
I hope

533
00:39:57,239 --> 00:39:58,615
you can respect her.

534
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:39,496
Now that the spark has been nurtured,

535
00:40:40,559 --> 00:40:41,622
things will

536
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:44,735
come to light in the end.

537
00:41:20,159 --> 00:41:23,215
Have you found the people of Changxi Palace?

538
00:41:24,440 --> 00:41:26,159
After Serpent Lord's order,

539
00:41:26,239 --> 00:41:28,255
Demon City has increased its defenses.

540
00:41:28,440 --> 00:41:30,536
Chang'an is heavily guarded.

541
00:41:32,360 --> 00:41:34,159
They have also realized

542
00:41:34,239 --> 00:41:36,320
that it is dangerous to stay in Chang'an

543
00:41:36,400 --> 00:41:39,856
so they found an abandoned residence outside the city.

544
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,536
They are currently recuperating.

545
00:41:43,679 --> 00:41:44,856
What about Chang Ming?

546
00:41:45,159 --> 00:41:46,295
Is he acting weirdly?

547
00:41:46,840 --> 00:41:50,016
It's all thanks to Elder Chang Ming

548
00:41:50,239 --> 00:41:53,295
that we are able to find them.

549
00:41:55,575 --> 00:41:57,280
What do you mean?
