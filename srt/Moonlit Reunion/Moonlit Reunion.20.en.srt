1
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,000
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,081 --> 00:01:34,080
(Episode 20)

3
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:02,560
You...

4
00:02:03,959 --> 00:02:05,600
What did you do?

5
00:02:06,639 --> 00:02:08,600
To kill Mei Zhu Yu,

6
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:10,800
I held nothing back.

7
00:02:11,383 --> 00:02:12,760
This formation

8
00:02:13,328 --> 00:02:14,960
is intricate and ruthless.

9
00:02:15,143 --> 00:02:17,320
The only way to break it is to find the eye of the formation.

10
00:02:17,678 --> 00:02:19,375
But even if they do,

11
00:02:20,199 --> 00:02:22,200
one of them has to die.

12
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,040
Why must someone die?

13
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:26,280
It's a formation of flesh and blood.

14
00:02:26,384 --> 00:02:28,440
A life must be offered to break it.

15
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:43,600
I'm hurting.

16
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,800
I'm sorry.

17
00:02:58,592 --> 00:02:59,960
How did you get poisoned?

18
00:03:00,352 --> 00:03:01,800
The incense in your carriage.

19
00:03:02,401 --> 00:03:03,720
It didn't affect you?

20
00:03:05,759 --> 00:03:07,800
The censer Ji Ya left in the carriage

21
00:03:08,224 --> 00:03:10,000
must have been meant for you.

22
00:03:18,176 --> 00:03:20,200
Did you come to Lin'an River

23
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:22,320
for me?

24
00:03:31,694 --> 00:03:33,600
I wonder what the situation is outside.

25
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:42,840
What's going on?

26
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,095
The archives of Arcane Appraisal Bureau have records on this.

27
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:55,440
Dark ritual formations use flesh and blood as a conduit.

28
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:56,616
The key to breaking it...

29
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,296
Where is it?

30
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,456
Do you remember

31
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:08,616
the tale of the man who stole the goddess's robes?

32
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:12,896
I told you that we were different from them.

33
00:04:14,040 --> 00:04:15,536
It wasn't because of our genders,

34
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,480
but because...

35
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,656
I would never put you in a difficult position.

36
00:04:22,080 --> 00:04:23,576
So I never dared to speak my heart.

37
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:29,815
I regret it so much.

38
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:32,475
Back in the sea of flowers in western suburbs,

39
00:04:34,079 --> 00:04:35,575
I realized I had fallen for you.

40
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:38,895
But I let fear hold myself back.

41
00:04:42,879 --> 00:04:43,879
You...

42
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:16,480
Mei Zhu Yu?

43
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,382
Mei Zhu Yu!

44
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:30,736
This must be the eye of the formation.

45
00:06:31,399 --> 00:06:32,695
Mei Zhu Yu!

46
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:40,176
Mei Zhu Yu!

47
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,296
The only way to keep her safe

48
00:06:42,519 --> 00:06:44,176
is to pierce the eye of the formation.

49
00:06:57,879 --> 00:07:00,416
Mei Zhu Yu!

50
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,639
The formation is broken.

51
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:28,815
Mei Zhu Yu!

52
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:31,895
Mei Zhu Yu!

53
00:07:38,839 --> 00:07:41,375
Mei Zhu Yu!

54
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:50,736
Mei Zhu Yu!

55
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,840
Mei Zhu Yu!

56
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,039
Thank you.

57
00:10:23,200 --> 00:10:24,417
What happened to you, Ji Ya?

58
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,383
We broke the formation.

59
00:10:27,559 --> 00:10:29,256
The dark magic backfired on him.

60
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:33,720
Zhen,

61
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,496
I'm relieved

62
00:10:36,519 --> 00:10:37,735
to see you're safe.

63
00:10:42,159 --> 00:10:44,319
Just now, that book on the boat...

64
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,176
You must be mistaken.

65
00:10:46,413 --> 00:10:48,229
We never brought any book aboard.

66
00:10:48,360 --> 00:10:51,213
- But I saw...   - You shouldn't have practiced the suppression technique.

67
00:10:52,080 --> 00:10:53,080
Now see.

68
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:56,496
You're seeing things even in broad daylight.

69
00:10:59,679 --> 00:11:03,815
So the formation really was your work.

70
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:07,120
Zhen.

71
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:10,016
Might we speak alone?

72
00:11:23,080 --> 00:11:24,080
You may start.

73
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:27,200
I learned

74
00:11:27,919 --> 00:11:29,815
the formation by chance.

75
00:11:30,080 --> 00:11:31,455
It was just for fun.

76
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:34,416
For fun?

77
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,095
We almost died in that formation.

78
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:39,935
You call that fun?

79
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:42,279
Zhen...

80
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,960
You misunderstood me. I didn't know you'd stumble into it.

81
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,776
I would never harm you.

82
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:49,776
You wouldn't harm me?

83
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,496
But you wanted to harm someone else.

84
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,016
How calculating.

85
00:11:58,200 --> 00:12:00,455
Knowing he suspected you,

86
00:12:01,039 --> 00:12:03,256
you lured him here to Lin'an River,

87
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,695
and even slipped knockout incense into my carriage.

88
00:12:08,400 --> 00:12:09,400
Knockout incense.

89
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,399
Anyway,

90
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:17,776
I invited you here today to confess my feelings.

91
00:12:17,879 --> 00:12:19,695
I never meant to hurt anyone.

92
00:12:20,200 --> 00:12:21,815
If he hadn't meddled at every turn,

93
00:12:22,120 --> 00:12:23,479
kept trying to take you away,

94
00:12:23,559 --> 00:12:24,656
none of this would've happened.

95
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:27,200
Right.

96
00:12:27,639 --> 00:12:29,256
You're a talented man.

97
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,615
Even your fun nearly got people killed.

98
00:12:34,919 --> 00:12:37,615
Your return to Chang'an this time wasn't so simple either, was it?

99
00:12:39,159 --> 00:12:40,719
That ink demon chaos of late,

100
00:12:40,799 --> 00:12:42,880
how much of that was your doing, I wonder?

101
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:46,376
- Zhen, I...   - Ink made from Kirin Horn Gum is priceless.

102
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,735
How did Si manage to get his hands on it?

103
00:12:51,879 --> 00:12:53,880
He has you to thank for that, doesn't he?

104
00:12:56,400 --> 00:12:59,200
(Purchased by Young Master Pei of the capital)

105
00:13:01,919 --> 00:13:04,400
When did you start suspecting me?

106
00:13:05,879 --> 00:13:07,095
When you returned to Chang'an,

107
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:09,200
from our first meeting at Ruyi Pavilion.

108
00:13:37,840 --> 00:13:39,176
I rarely light scented incense.

109
00:13:40,179 --> 00:13:41,834
All these years at the pavilion,

110
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,735
everyone knows my habits.

111
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,136
But on the day you arrived,

112
00:13:48,745 --> 00:13:50,281
the staff lit incense.

113
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:52,575
It was unusual.

114
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:54,455
As soon as that scented incense was lit,

115
00:13:54,919 --> 00:13:56,960
I began to see you as...

116
00:14:15,080 --> 00:14:16,496
As someone else.

117
00:14:18,093 --> 00:14:19,749
You are an expert with incense.

118
00:14:20,120 --> 00:14:21,695
Can you ease my doubts?

119
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:23,455
So all this time...

120
00:14:25,639 --> 00:14:27,296
You were just pretending with me?

121
00:14:31,879 --> 00:14:33,440
I thought you understood...

122
00:14:34,919 --> 00:14:36,296
My love for you.

123
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:39,800
If it were just the incense trick, I might have let it go.

124
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:42,280
But why did you have to practice dark arts?

125
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:44,399
For you.

126
00:14:45,026 --> 00:14:46,881
To win your affection.

127
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:48,695
What do you mean?

128
00:14:49,039 --> 00:14:50,039
I know...

129
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:52,776
You don't reciprocate my feelings.

130
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,656
You're strong and healthy, skilled in martial arts,

131
00:14:57,279 --> 00:14:58,279
while I'm...

132
00:14:59,159 --> 00:15:01,575
Useless, sickly, weak.

133
00:15:01,799 --> 00:15:04,496
When I was younger, I swore to myself

134
00:15:05,919 --> 00:15:07,680
that someday I'd become strong.

135
00:15:08,445 --> 00:15:09,445
Later,

136
00:15:09,666 --> 00:15:11,281
I learned there was such a thing

137
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:13,215
as suppressive technique.

138
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:14,679
So,

139
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:16,695
I offered up my right eye.

140
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:20,215
I thought that if I could just obtain the power,

141
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:22,975
I would be no different from anyone else.

142
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:24,815
Maybe even stronger.

143
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:27,536
Then I would be worthy of you.

144
00:15:29,559 --> 00:15:31,176
Now I've finally succeeded.

145
00:15:31,640 --> 00:15:32,640
I should be able

146
00:15:33,640 --> 00:15:35,176
to make you rely on me,

147
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,023
admire me.

148
00:15:39,919 --> 00:15:42,095
We're better suited for each other, aren't we?

149
00:15:43,679 --> 00:15:44,742
Admire you?

150
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:46,240
Rely on you?

151
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,160
Is that really love?

152
00:15:49,320 --> 00:15:51,800
Of course I love you, Zhen.

153
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,776
You are my one and only treasure.

154
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:58,095
When I was caught in that formation,

155
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:01,776
did you even consider risking your life to save me?

156
00:16:14,360 --> 00:16:15,640
Sweet words.

157
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:17,297
Your actions, however, were...

158
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,640
Brutally honest.

159
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:22,160
Yes.

160
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,256
I hesitated.

161
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,457
But that's only human!

162
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:29,016
Mei Zhu Yu would have done the same!

163
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:32,455
If he were in my position, he would have hesitated too!

164
00:16:32,919 --> 00:16:34,920
He would have thought of himself first!

165
00:16:36,759 --> 00:16:37,759
Zhen...

166
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:40,455
You really think he loves you? Cares for you?

167
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,240
That he'd risk his own life to save you?

168
00:16:43,559 --> 00:16:44,559
He wouldn't!

169
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:04,376
I don't need your help.

170
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:05,840
Pei Ji Ya,

171
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:07,680
If you want the pain to stop,

172
00:17:08,359 --> 00:17:09,422
cooperate with me.

173
00:17:16,279 --> 00:17:17,375
What are you doing?

174
00:17:17,759 --> 00:17:18,759
Helping him.

175
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,056
Though the burning pain is gone,

176
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,135
but that eye you offered up for dark arts will never fully heal.

177
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:41,600
Now you must rest and recover.

178
00:17:42,119 --> 00:17:43,696
If you continue down this path,

179
00:17:44,200 --> 00:17:45,456
no one can save you.

180
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:51,175
Good thing Kunzhou is serene and uplifting,

181
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:53,216
the ideal place for recuperation.

182
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:54,720
Kunzhou?

183
00:17:55,279 --> 00:17:57,640
Ji Ya is returning to Kunzhou immediately.

184
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:00,135
- Zhen...   - You used your right eye to practice dark arts.

185
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:03,496
Now you're just suffering the consequences.

186
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,135
Or do you want His Majesty to hear of this as well?

187
00:18:13,599 --> 00:18:14,599
Zhen...

188
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:17,496
You are so cruel.

189
00:18:18,759 --> 00:18:20,335
I've always been cruel.

190
00:18:20,680 --> 00:18:21,976
You should know that by now.

191
00:18:23,079 --> 00:18:24,079
Let's go.

192
00:19:33,480 --> 00:19:38,160
(Chang'an)

193
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:44,830
Thank you for taking care of me the past few days.

194
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,760
I... I didn't do much.

195
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:50,056
I just stayed by your side.

196
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:52,399
You're going to be my wife someday.

197
00:19:52,565 --> 00:19:54,621
Taking care of you is only right.

198
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:07,480
Mei Si.

199
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,497
Take my advice, stop wasting your feelings on me.

200
00:20:13,079 --> 00:20:15,016
I will never marry you.

201
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:21,480
Also...

202
00:20:22,200 --> 00:20:23,776
Don't forget your promise.

203
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:27,296
I swear, I'll never tell a soul.

204
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,000
I'm going now.

205
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:43,815
Maybe you're refusing me

206
00:20:44,319 --> 00:20:45,575
because of your identity as a demon.

207
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:48,560
But I believe

208
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,663
that one day,

209
00:20:51,606 --> 00:20:53,261
you will marry me.

210
00:21:23,799 --> 00:21:25,920
Young Master, you should let it go.

211
00:21:26,240 --> 00:21:28,495
Is it worth holding on to Lady Wu like this?

212
00:21:29,759 --> 00:21:30,759
When we were children,

213
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,000
I stole a kiss from her.

214
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:35,936
And she actually hit me until I cried.

215
00:21:36,680 --> 00:21:37,976
I knew it then.

216
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:40,016
She was the one I wanted.

217
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:45,128
Because she's the strongest, fiercest woman I've ever met.

218
00:21:46,160 --> 00:21:47,456
That may be true, Young Master.

219
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,615
But isn't Her Highness a little too fierce?

220
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:53,175
She hardly carries herself like a gentle, virtuous wife.

221
00:21:55,199 --> 00:21:56,199
You don't understand.

222
00:21:56,759 --> 00:21:58,095
Every flower blooms in its own way.

223
00:21:58,920 --> 00:22:01,822
If every woman was meek and followed all the rules,

224
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:03,548
how boring would that be?

225
00:22:06,200 --> 00:22:08,640
A woman like her, so fierce,

226
00:22:09,000 --> 00:22:10,280
is far more captivating.

227
00:22:12,039 --> 00:22:13,039
However...

228
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:15,623
Yes?

229
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,376
It's fine for a woman to be strong,

230
00:22:22,920 --> 00:22:25,640
but she should never be stronger than her husband.

231
00:22:27,365 --> 00:22:28,365
You're right, Young Master.

232
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,653
I thought my suppressive technique could hold her down

233
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:36,806
and get me everything else I desired,

234
00:22:38,200 --> 00:22:40,976
but it turned out to be worthless.

235
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:44,353
After all these years, all the money you've poured into that person,

236
00:22:44,680 --> 00:22:46,496
in the end, it all came to nothing.

237
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:48,182
If you ask me,

238
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,575
it's him you ought to settle accounts with.

239
00:22:51,019 --> 00:22:52,019
You're right.

240
00:22:52,920 --> 00:22:54,255
It's time to talk to him.

241
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:19,480
(Mei Zhu Yu is indeed a disciple of our sect.)

242
00:23:24,326 --> 00:23:25,781
What's so funny, Young Master?

243
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:29,399
My lifesaver has confirmed my suspicion.

244
00:23:29,559 --> 00:23:32,520
Mei Zhu Yu really is a Celestial Master of Changxi Palace.

245
00:23:33,106 --> 00:23:34,281
What does it matter?

246
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:38,375
The fact that he hides his identity

247
00:23:38,519 --> 00:23:40,015
means he has secrets.

248
00:23:40,653 --> 00:23:43,869
I doubt his relationship with Zhen will end well.

249
00:23:45,079 --> 00:23:46,736
When their relationship fails,

250
00:23:46,839 --> 00:23:48,415
he'll be the loser all the same.

251
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:50,000
I'll just

252
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:51,816
sit back and watch.

253
00:24:00,319 --> 00:24:01,456
Come on, Master Snake,

254
00:24:01,599 --> 00:24:03,253
the moment I got back you said you needed a bath.

255
00:24:03,446 --> 00:24:05,479
I've been squatting here so long my legs are numb.

256
00:24:05,559 --> 00:24:06,976
Why aren't you getting in the water yet?

257
00:24:09,653 --> 00:24:10,828
What would you know?

258
00:24:11,599 --> 00:24:13,303
Bathing is important.

259
00:24:14,633 --> 00:24:16,009
But before I enter the water,

260
00:24:16,440 --> 00:24:19,006
I must draw on the power of the full moon

261
00:24:19,480 --> 00:24:21,873
to restore my energy.

262
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:23,496
You should've said so earlier.

263
00:24:23,720 --> 00:24:25,480
I could've just gotten you a tub at my residence.

264
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:27,015
I'd pull up a chair

265
00:24:27,193 --> 00:24:28,929
and sit with you all night while you drew power.

266
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:30,855
This Qiu Pond in the east city

267
00:24:31,079 --> 00:24:32,976
is the birthplace of our kind.

268
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
How could a tub compare?

269
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:36,095
But now,

270
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,815
you're still a little loach.

271
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:39,960
You know nothing.

272
00:24:40,986 --> 00:24:41,986
I'm ready.

273
00:24:43,839 --> 00:24:44,839
Alright, alright.

274
00:25:00,698 --> 00:25:01,698
Master Xuan Hui?

275
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:04,096
Can you really swim?

276
00:25:04,347 --> 00:25:05,883
Have you been washed away by the current?

277
00:25:08,240 --> 00:25:09,240
Master Snake?

278
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Master Snake?

279
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:17,799
Master Snake?

280
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:31,720
Little mortal,

281
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:33,655
don't you recognize me?

282
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:35,680
Master Snake...

283
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:40,000
You... You're huge.

284
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:41,480
Well?

285
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:43,601
Don't I look magnificent?

286
00:25:46,200 --> 00:25:48,496
Magnificent, sure,

287
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:52,135
but you... You scared me.

288
00:26:00,200 --> 00:26:01,200
Little Lo...

289
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:02,863
Master Xuan Hui...

290
00:26:03,807 --> 00:26:05,183
So this is what you really look like!

291
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Back off.

292
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:07,902
Brat.

293
00:26:08,319 --> 00:26:10,360
Touch me again and I'll bite your head off!

294
00:26:13,400 --> 00:26:14,463
You're so adorable...

295
00:26:15,000 --> 00:26:16,776
Ouch! Let go, Master Snake!

296
00:26:16,920 --> 00:26:18,120
I thought we were friends!

297
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:19,240
Friends...

298
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:20,800
Friends?

299
00:26:27,160 --> 00:26:28,160
Lady Liu!

300
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:34,575
Lady Liu, this is the surprise I was telling you about.

301
00:26:34,840 --> 00:26:37,016
I figured he could keep you company.

302
00:26:38,359 --> 00:26:40,166
So this is the surprise you spoke of.

303
00:26:42,160 --> 00:26:44,280
So this is the Lady Liu you told me about?

304
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:48,000
Serpent Lord, since when do you lower yourself to befriend mortals?

305
00:26:49,559 --> 00:26:50,559
Wait, hold on.

306
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:53,216
What did you just call her? What lord?

307
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:55,160
If you could hang out with a mortal,

308
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:56,897
why couldn't I?

309
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:58,560
Couldn't what?

310
00:26:58,960 --> 00:27:00,456
After I injured you that day,

311
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,015
I didn't expect

312
00:27:02,839 --> 00:27:05,160
this guy here would find you and take you home.

313
00:27:07,079 --> 00:27:09,375
That's right! I'm the one who rescued him!

314
00:27:09,846 --> 00:27:11,021
Rescued?

315
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:13,776
It was a tactical retreat.

316
00:27:14,839 --> 00:27:15,880
Tactical retreat?

317
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,560
What are you talking about? I can't understand a thing!

318
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:20,640
- Will someone please explain?   - Shut up!

319
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,175
Fine. You guys talk then.

320
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:26,816
Wicked demon Xuan Hui,

321
00:27:27,359 --> 00:27:28,696
you have slaughtered innocent demons.

322
00:27:29,120 --> 00:27:30,376
Your sins are immense.

323
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:31,855
Do you admit your guilt?

324
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:07,360
Why?

325
00:30:18,599 --> 00:30:19,599
Admit it?

326
00:30:20,400 --> 00:30:21,656
I've done nothing wrong.

327
00:30:21,920 --> 00:30:22,999
They deserved to die.

328
00:30:23,119 --> 00:30:24,256
Why did they deserve it?

329
00:30:25,400 --> 00:30:27,976
Who gave you the right to decide who lives or dies?

330
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:32,095
I'm taking you back to the Demon Prison.

331
00:30:32,326 --> 00:30:33,422
Enough talk.

332
00:30:34,160 --> 00:30:35,855
I'm not going back to the Demon City.

333
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:45,056
Watch out, Lady Liu!

334
00:31:15,105 --> 00:31:16,841
You've only just shed your skin.

335
00:31:17,000 --> 00:31:18,536
You're at your weakest right now.

336
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:21,375
It won't be that easy for you to seize me.

337
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:26,135
Don't hurt my Lady Liu!

338
00:31:42,119 --> 00:31:43,456
Why did you jump in front her?

339
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,135
You can hurt me if you want,

340
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:48,496
but just leave her alone.

341
00:31:55,039 --> 00:31:56,256
Lady Liu, huh?

342
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:58,815
Protected by a mortal.

343
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,936
You really haven't changed at all, Serpent Lord.

344
00:32:02,539 --> 00:32:05,555
Still as shameless as ever.

345
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:09,056
Bringing you to justice

346
00:32:09,799 --> 00:32:11,655
is my duty.

347
00:32:12,440 --> 00:32:14,335
You really are inflexibly rigid, aren't you?

348
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:15,936
You'd even turn against your own kin.

349
00:32:37,119 --> 00:32:38,119
Zhen?

350
00:32:39,720 --> 00:32:40,783
Kitty...

351
00:32:48,480 --> 00:32:52,016
How...

352
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:56,776
You idiot!

353
00:32:57,759 --> 00:32:59,175
She's the Cat Lord of the Demon City!

354
00:32:59,573 --> 00:33:00,573
Cat Lord?

355
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:02,815
There's a Cat Lord too?

356
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:12,016
What are you doing, Kitty?

357
00:33:12,119 --> 00:33:16,696
Si, we weren't supposed to reveal demon magic in front of mortals.

358
00:33:16,839 --> 00:33:19,415
But you've been around Xuan Hui for so long,

359
00:33:19,880 --> 00:33:21,616
and you've witnessed Tai Zhen shedding her skin.

360
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:25,615
I suppose there's no point in hiding it from you anymore.

361
00:33:27,000 --> 00:33:28,000
Cat Lord...

362
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,415
So you knew all along.

363
00:33:37,827 --> 00:33:39,426
I'm going too, Si.

364
00:33:39,599 --> 00:33:40,776
Alright, Zhen.

365
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,640
This is for colluding

366
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,295
with Gray Set and set that fire

367
00:33:55,626 --> 00:33:57,242
to harm me during the Lantern Festival.

368
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:02,733
This is for meddling in the chaos

369
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,256
caused by the Ink Demons

370
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:06,536
and making it worse for me.

371
00:34:07,079 --> 00:34:08,816
If you insist on dragging me back to the Demon City,

372
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,615
then you might as well kill me now.

373
00:34:10,719 --> 00:34:12,599
- That's not your decision to make.   - Wait.

374
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:14,359
Do you know

375
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:16,215
why he committed those crimes?

376
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:18,777
He's a vicious criminal.

377
00:34:19,119 --> 00:34:20,615
Why should I care about his reasons?

378
00:34:22,600 --> 00:34:24,350
I've obtained his Mirror of Clarity.

379
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:26,336
I've seen his past.

380
00:34:26,599 --> 00:34:27,775
You should take a look too.

381
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:29,719
Give that back.

382
00:34:31,039 --> 00:34:32,039
Give that back!

383
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:33,199
Don't move.

384
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:34,695
Come on.

385
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,816
- Little Rain Dragon...   - We met again.

386
00:35:04,639 --> 00:35:05,639
Stay still!

387
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,119
How could it be?

388
00:35:29,065 --> 00:35:30,065
Lady Liu,

389
00:35:30,480 --> 00:35:33,416
those demons tortured him and humiliated him.

390
00:35:33,920 --> 00:35:37,175
Did the Demon City ever punish them for it?

391
00:35:38,472 --> 00:35:40,329
The Rain Dragons started from humble beginnings,

392
00:35:41,400 --> 00:35:42,735
especially the black serpents.

393
00:35:43,393 --> 00:35:45,248
It's inevitable they'd be looked down on when young.

394
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:47,936
When I saw the scars on him,

395
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:51,216
I thought it was just roughhousing among young demons.

396
00:35:52,880 --> 00:35:54,095
I never realized...

397
00:35:54,760 --> 00:35:57,456
You call these wounds "roughhousing"?

398
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:01,215
"Fight for your own respect."

399
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,776
Those were your exact words to me!

400
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:07,319
I did exactly what you said.

401
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,936
So why are you punishing me for it?

402
00:36:11,159 --> 00:36:12,182
I did nothing wrong.

403
00:36:13,333 --> 00:36:14,333
Nothing.

404
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:15,655
Nothing!

405
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,600
Serpent Lord.

406
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:22,023
This was your case

407
00:36:22,532 --> 00:36:24,108
to begin with.

408
00:36:25,000 --> 00:36:27,175
And now you know the full story.

409
00:36:28,239 --> 00:36:29,302
His punishment

410
00:36:30,360 --> 00:36:31,456
is yours to decide.

411
00:36:36,920 --> 00:36:37,920
Xuan Hui.

412
00:36:39,480 --> 00:36:40,936
You slaughtered your fellow demons.

413
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:43,896
For that, you deserve punishment.

414
00:36:47,719 --> 00:36:49,215
But your circumstances are pitiable.

415
00:36:50,733 --> 00:36:52,068
The sentence you were given before

416
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:54,816
was too harsh.

417
00:37:00,199 --> 00:37:02,135
I hereby remit

418
00:37:03,360 --> 00:37:04,976
the remaining 20 years of your prison term,

419
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,423
in my name as Serpent Lord.

420
00:37:22,599 --> 00:37:23,816
Even so,

421
00:37:24,519 --> 00:37:25,896
I'm not returning to the Demon City.

422
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:28,215
I'm going to become a Rain Dragon.

423
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,255
You may stay.

424
00:37:31,559 --> 00:37:32,695
Though he committed crimes,

425
00:37:33,159 --> 00:37:34,416
his reasons were understandable.

426
00:37:34,599 --> 00:37:35,599
I believe

427
00:37:36,679 --> 00:37:37,976
we can give him a chance.

428
00:37:44,599 --> 00:37:46,056
Since your ascension is near,

429
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,456
you may remain here

430
00:37:49,353 --> 00:37:50,769
until then.

431
00:37:54,200 --> 00:37:55,200
Si.

432
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,897
Zhen, I swear,

433
00:37:58,480 --> 00:38:00,695
I'll never breathe a word of this to anyone.

434
00:38:01,480 --> 00:38:04,423
Keep him in check when you're back in Chang'an.

435
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,853
Zhen, I'm just a mortal. You want me to keep a demon in line?

436
00:38:08,192 --> 00:38:09,192
Are you sure?

437
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:11,136
Aren't you two friends?

438
00:38:12,639 --> 00:38:14,816
I'm just worried I can't keep Master Snake in check.

439
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,215
You're calling him Master Snake?

440
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:22,295
He told me to call him that.

441
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:25,896
In the demon world's hierarchy,

442
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,576
Xuan Hui calls

443
00:38:28,519 --> 00:38:30,160
Lady Liu 'Elder Sister.'

444
00:38:31,119 --> 00:38:33,175
Which means you, in turn, should be calling her...

445
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:43,175
Master Snake's Elder Sister...

446
00:38:44,199 --> 00:38:45,856
Then I guess I should call her...

447
00:38:46,440 --> 00:38:47,503
Grand Mistress.

448
00:38:51,039 --> 00:38:52,536
Come on, give me a hand.

449
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:56,000
Master Snake,

450
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:59,575
is Lady Liu's standing in the demon world really that high?

451
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,255
Just shut up.

452
00:39:07,480 --> 00:39:08,775
What are you doing here?

453
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,423
I was waiting for you. I wanted to talk to you.

454
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:22,240
I've been staying at your residence for quite some time.

455
00:39:22,320 --> 00:39:23,856
People will start to talk.

456
00:39:24,239 --> 00:39:26,056
Now that Young Master Pei's matter is resolved,

457
00:39:26,159 --> 00:39:27,496
I'm going back to my residence.

458
00:39:28,040 --> 00:39:29,721
I don't care what people think about me.

459
00:39:29,840 --> 00:39:31,680
But I care what they think about you.

460
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:14,679
Does it hurt?

461
00:40:20,199 --> 00:40:21,199
I'm sorry.

462
00:40:21,640 --> 00:40:22,663
It's my fault.

463
00:40:25,679 --> 00:40:26,742
From now on,

464
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:29,135
I won't allow myself

465
00:40:29,800 --> 00:40:31,615
or anyone else to ever hurt you again.

466
00:40:34,159 --> 00:40:35,856
What if I'm the one who hurts you?

467
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:39,295
Why would you want to hurt me?

468
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,215
Who knows?

469
00:40:42,720 --> 00:40:45,496
I've got a bad temper and worse character.

470
00:40:48,219 --> 00:40:49,219
As long as it's what you want,

471
00:40:49,680 --> 00:40:50,896
anything is fine.
