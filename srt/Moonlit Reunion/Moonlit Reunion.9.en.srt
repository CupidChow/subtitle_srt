00:01:27,185 --> 00:01:31,000
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,124 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 9)

3
00:01:41,311 --> 00:01:42,505
I'm here to accompany you.

4
00:01:42,680 --> 00:01:43,840
Are you still in pain today?

5
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,274
No. Look. What is that?

6
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:48,040
What is that?

7
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,320
It's a woman.

8
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,192
How can I make you better?

9
00:01:57,626 --> 00:01:59,280
I just want to talk with you.

10
00:02:00,225 --> 00:02:01,520
It's really a woman.

11
00:02:03,160 --> 00:02:04,200
Let's go...

12
00:02:06,852 --> 00:02:10,566
When did the abnormality of this white camellia tree begin?

13
00:02:11,960 --> 00:02:12,960
Half a month ago.

14
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:16,633
The oddities began here in the camellia garden.

15
00:02:17,065 --> 00:02:18,778
That woman lingers under the tree,

16
00:02:19,319 --> 00:02:20,393
glowing white all over,

17
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,073
murmuring against the trunk like some wandering spirit.

18
00:02:25,639 --> 00:02:28,199
When I first saw her, I thought my eyes were playing tricks.

19
00:02:28,453 --> 00:02:31,166
But soon after, I saw her again.

20
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:33,952
That's when the strange things began.

21
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:37,480
Strange things?

22
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,600
Your Highness,

23
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,360
this camellia tree has been kept in the palace for many years.

24
00:02:42,632 --> 00:02:44,426
It's Princess Yuan Zhen's favorite tree.

25
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:47,553
Although it normally grows lush and green,

26
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,033
this year was the very first time it bloomed.

27
00:02:51,520 --> 00:02:52,953
We were delighted.

28
00:02:53,225 --> 00:02:54,745
The Princess even rewarded us.

29
00:02:54,826 --> 00:02:56,020
But not long after,

30
00:02:56,265 --> 00:03:00,666
the tree suddenly began shedding its leaves, dripping blood, and even...

31
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:06,393
Even at night, the garden would echo with mournful cries,

32
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:07,960
like the wailing of a ghost.

33
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,192
Wandering spirits? Wailing of ghosts?

34
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,673
Nonsense.

35
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:18,753
We were baffled too.

36
00:03:18,987 --> 00:03:21,460
But after we checked it several times,

37
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,273
we couldn't find anything wrong.

38
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:27,472
We don't know what sickness has struck this white camellia tree,

39
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,560
but it's clearly withering.

40
00:03:31,372 --> 00:03:32,692
If there was something so unusual,

41
00:03:32,973 --> 00:03:34,733
why didn't you report it to the Empress?

42
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,320
The Princess cherishes this camellia tree.

43
00:03:37,401 --> 00:03:42,242
Her Highness worried that the Empress would order it cut down if she knew,

44
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,592
so she warned us strictly not to speak of it.

45
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,834
Enough. You may go.

46
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,633
This matter is not to be spoken of.

47
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:24,284
Mr. Mei, haven't you been busy these days?

48
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:26,280
Are you not going back to the Arcane Appraisal Bureau?

49
00:04:26,519 --> 00:04:27,959
If it's something unnatural,

50
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:29,833
it's the Arcane Appraisal Bureau's responsibility.

51
00:04:29,986 --> 00:04:31,140
I must investigate it thoroughly.

52
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:35,413
Lady Wu, are you really not afraid of ghosts?

53
00:04:35,633 --> 00:04:38,305
I am. I'm afraid of ghosts, of course.

54
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:42,713
But if it's a good-looking ghost,

55
00:04:43,252 --> 00:04:44,606
that's a different story.

56
00:04:46,760 --> 00:04:49,032
I think I know who she is now.

57
00:04:50,786 --> 00:04:51,826
Who is she?

58
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,800
Are you hungry?

59
00:04:59,358 --> 00:05:01,238
I brought you the payment for the demon you hunted down

60
00:05:01,319 --> 00:05:02,473
a couple of days ago.

61
00:05:03,525 --> 00:05:05,198
I almost forgot.

62
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:07,120
Fortunately, you are a woman of your word, Lady Hu Zhu.

63
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:10,520
Thank you for referring this business to me, Lady Hu Zhu.

64
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,360
I must repay you for this favor.

65
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,193
No need for a favor.

66
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:19,794
Just give me that fox tail charm.

67
00:05:20,686 --> 00:05:22,319
Seven-colored fox tail.

68
00:05:23,325 --> 00:05:24,958
I've never seen one.

69
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,241
This one? This one...

70
00:05:27,320 --> 00:05:29,080
Why? You don't want to give it up?

71
00:05:30,113 --> 00:05:31,153
No, that's not it.

72
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:33,672
I mean, it isn't real.

73
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:34,920
It's worthless.

74
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,242
Not real?

75
00:05:37,597 --> 00:05:38,919
What does that mean?

76
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:42,360
It's just a tassel made of rabbit fur, dyed in colors.

77
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,233
Because after I made it, it looked so much like a fox's tail.

78
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,440
So...

79
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:51,519
Seven-colored fox tail is its name, not the material.

80
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,233
So all that pride you had was really over catching a rabbit.

81
00:06:03,873 --> 00:06:05,185
I caught a rabbit.

82
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:09,320
Isn't that impressive?

83
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,033
Very impressive.

84
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,520
I didn't expect that after only meeting me twice,

85
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:21,840
you had already treated me this well.

86
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:23,800
I've decided.

87
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:27,640
From now on, Lady Hu Zhu, you're my best friend.

88
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:29,879
From now on, if there's anything I can do for you,

89
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:32,072
just say the word. I won't hesitate.

90
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:33,712
No need to be so formal.

91
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,353
I'll look out for you out of respect for Lady Wu and Mr. Mei.

92
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,320
Just because they know each other?

93
00:06:39,460 --> 00:06:40,460
You don't know?

94
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,133
The two of them...

95
00:06:44,480 --> 00:06:46,033
They're more than just acquaintances.

96
00:06:48,492 --> 00:06:49,492
What?

97
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:51,632
Are you saying they're

98
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,632
that kind of a relationship?

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:56,113
At the very least, not ordinary friends.

100
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:02,272
I can't believe Lady Wu, who seemed so nice,

101
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,800
is actually a fox spirit.

102
00:07:05,393 --> 00:07:06,393
What did you say?

103
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:10,000
A fox?

104
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,240
A fox spirit!

105
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:26,432
Anyway, Brother Mei would never be interested in Lady Wu Zhen.

106
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:31,873
You probably don't know my tenth brother well.

107
00:07:37,342 --> 00:07:39,022
(When I first started training in martial arts,)

108
00:07:39,455 --> 00:07:42,183
(I had strength but no technique.)

109
00:07:42,504 --> 00:07:44,617
(I practiced tirelessly every day.)

110
00:07:45,279 --> 00:07:48,473
(Not only during the day, but also at night.)

111
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:52,752
My other nine cousins

112
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,673
thought I would never succeed,

113
00:07:57,320 --> 00:07:58,914
(but only Brother Mei stayed silent.)

114
00:07:59,439 --> 00:08:00,872
(He just spent all his time in the study.)

115
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:04,553
(He wasn't very warm to me, but he was gentle.)

116
00:08:06,079 --> 00:08:09,113
(One night, while I was still training in the courtyard,)

117
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:12,072
(Brother Mei came to me for the first time.)

118
00:08:12,480 --> 00:08:15,312
(He seriously corrected my mistakes and helped me improve my martial arts.)

119
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,233
(After that, he came every night at the same hour,)

120
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,033
(for the time it takes to drink two cups of tea.)

121
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,793
(Because of his guidance, I finally mastered the basics.)

122
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:30,272
(I was very grateful to him.)

123
00:08:31,279 --> 00:08:34,512
(I thought he had a good impression of me)

124
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:37,872
(or couldn't bear to watch me struggle,)

125
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:39,392
(that's why he helped me.)

126
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,713
(But later, he told me not to thank him.)

127
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,800
It was only later that I found out that

128
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:47,113
it was because my practice was too loud every night

129
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,272
and was disturbing his studies.

130
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:50,680
He wanted to help me master the basics quickly

131
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:53,632
so he could get a peaceful night's sleep.

132
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:57,272
He told you that directly?

133
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:01,000
That's the kind of man Brother Mei is.

134
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:05,233
He seems like he has no temper, detached, without desires.

135
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:08,152
(But in truth, he's utterly resolute.)

136
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,073
(Once he decides something, no one can sway him.)

137
00:09:12,679 --> 00:09:15,239
(And if he doesn't want to reveal something, no one can make him.)

138
00:09:15,879 --> 00:09:17,792
(It's actually very difficult to please him.)

139
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:19,792
(Sometimes,)

140
00:09:20,879 --> 00:09:23,152
(I even feel like I'm not that close to him.)

141
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,233
(He always seems so calm)

142
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:27,320
and indifferent.

143
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:29,713
He's never angry or joyful.

144
00:09:30,599 --> 00:09:31,719
Isn't there a saying?

145
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,000
With no desires, one is unshakable.

146
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:37,953
The less you desire from the world, the fewer weaknesses you have.

147
00:09:38,799 --> 00:09:41,632
So, even if Lady Wu has many good qualities,

148
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:46,880
my tenth brother will never be interested in her.

149
00:09:59,560 --> 00:10:00,600
Where did you get this?

150
00:10:02,666 --> 00:10:03,746
From the Imperial Kitchen.

151
00:10:04,453 --> 00:10:05,453
I stole it.

152
00:10:22,013 --> 00:10:23,053
Lady Wu.

153
00:10:23,480 --> 00:10:26,713
Can you tell me who that woman in white is now?

154
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,032
Palace folk are superstitious and love to exaggerate.

155
00:10:32,159 --> 00:10:34,313
The truth is often that a person is behind it.

156
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:40,912
There are very few who can wander here at night without scruples.

157
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,713
The reason is probably

158
00:10:48,440 --> 00:10:50,272
a young girl troubled in the dead of night.

159
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:07,159
I'm here.

160
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:09,994
I heard Mother is coming to my quarters to see me tonight,

161
00:11:10,679 --> 00:11:12,959
so I slipped out first to talk with you.

162
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,039
This is the medicine the imperial physician gave me.

163
00:11:38,639 --> 00:11:41,912
But I know you're the one who's truly sick.

164
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:44,954
How can I save you?

165
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:57,953
(So it's a white camellia spirit.)

166
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,913
Why do you always try to drive me away?

167
00:12:04,879 --> 00:12:06,473
I'm all alone.

168
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:08,193
It's no fun by myself.

169
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,634
No fun?

170
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,632
I'll play with you.

171
00:12:13,226 --> 00:12:15,746
Aunt Wu Zhen, who is he?

172
00:12:17,853 --> 00:12:18,853
Greetings, Your Highness.

173
00:12:21,559 --> 00:12:24,320
He is Consort Mei's cousin and also my attendant.

174
00:12:35,613 --> 00:12:37,966
Yuan Zhen, dear child, what are you doing here?

175
00:12:38,438 --> 00:12:41,912
I was in a bad mood, so I came out to walk around to clear my head.

176
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:45,752
Bad mood?

177
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:48,600
Ah, I see.

178
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,552
You must have been frightened by this bloody white camellia.

179
00:12:55,919 --> 00:12:57,280
I'll have it chopped down at once.

180
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,073
No, he is my friend!

181
00:13:03,960 --> 00:13:05,000
You mustn't cut him.

182
00:13:05,799 --> 00:13:07,552
This tree has been with me for many years.

183
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,433
I tell him everything.

184
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,272
Many years?

185
00:13:18,240 --> 00:13:19,720
Then of course, it's hard to part with it.

186
00:13:25,960 --> 00:13:27,040
Yuan Zhen?

187
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:28,920
What's the matter?

188
00:13:29,673 --> 00:13:32,193
She's caught a cold lately. Her body seems weak.

189
00:13:32,274 --> 00:13:33,907
Please take her back first.

190
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,840
I'll send someone to look for the imperial physician.

191
00:13:36,778 --> 00:13:37,818
Alright.

192
00:13:51,223 --> 00:13:52,640
Come out.

193
00:13:55,263 --> 00:13:57,760
(White Camellia Spirit)

194
00:14:02,919 --> 00:14:03,959
You...

195
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:06,120
Who are you?

196
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,112
Cat Lord of the Demon Market.

197
00:14:17,333 --> 00:14:18,605
Cat Lord of the Demon Market?

198
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:21,400
What is that?

199
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,280
Doesn't matter.

200
00:14:23,759 --> 00:14:26,073
But where did you come from, White Camellia Spirit?

201
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,394
I've never seen you before.

202
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,433
If you care about Yuan Zhen, then you have to trust me.

203
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,193
I'm her aunt. I would never harm her.

204
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,353
Many years ago, I awakened my spirit through cultivation.

205
00:14:43,759 --> 00:14:48,593
Later, by chance, the Princess saved me.

206
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:50,792
Palace life was lonely,

207
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:55,632
so she would come here every day and share her thoughts with me.

208
00:14:57,245 --> 00:14:58,439
Only half a year ago

209
00:14:59,639 --> 00:15:01,272
did I finally gain human form.

210
00:15:02,320 --> 00:15:05,113
No wonder the gardeners said you bloomed for the first time this year.

211
00:15:07,200 --> 00:15:09,392
It wasn't because of their care after all.

212
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:10,713
I only wished

213
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:13,834
to bloom for her to see.

214
00:15:15,106 --> 00:15:16,578
But such days were too brief.

215
00:15:17,147 --> 00:15:18,147
For half a month,

216
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:22,473
I've been plagued by these parasitic, poisonous moths.

217
00:15:23,480 --> 00:15:24,792
I know my time is running out.

218
00:15:26,799 --> 00:15:28,353
I'm at my last breath.

219
00:15:29,360 --> 00:15:31,593
Do you know that there is another name for the white camellia?

220
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:33,400
White camellia

221
00:15:36,679 --> 00:15:38,152
is also known as the 'beheading flower'.

222
00:15:38,600 --> 00:15:40,113
Why is it called that?

223
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:42,272
Because most flowers in this world

224
00:15:42,679 --> 00:15:43,993
shed their petals one by one

225
00:15:44,960 --> 00:15:47,032
as they wither.

226
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:49,833
Only the white camellia

227
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:55,752
falls as a whole at its most magnificent,

228
00:15:57,519 --> 00:15:58,752
looking like a severed head.

229
00:16:05,960 --> 00:16:09,672
I cannot bear for Yuan Zhen to see me in that state.

230
00:16:09,760 --> 00:16:10,880
But...

231
00:16:13,219 --> 00:16:14,491
But I cannot stop her.

232
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:21,280
Your Highness, you're awake.

233
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:23,714
Do you feel unwell?

234
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,712
How did I get back here?

235
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,792
Brother, I have to go back and help him.

236
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:38,079
Him? Who are you referring to?

237
00:16:39,340 --> 00:16:40,973
(Yuan Zhen cherishes you so much.)

238
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:44,833
If you just die like that, she will be devastated.

239
00:16:47,279 --> 00:16:48,872
I won't let her be heartbroken.

240
00:16:55,279 --> 00:16:58,473
It takes 20 years for Ruyi Pavilion to ferment a pot of Qianhua Mead.

241
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:02,193
I finally managed to steal it,

242
00:17:04,119 --> 00:17:05,913
only to waste it on these bugs.

243
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:10,800
It smells so good.

244
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,512
That white camellia tree is just sick.

245
00:18:00,759 --> 00:18:01,953
You have to help him.

246
00:18:03,759 --> 00:18:06,393
Your Highness, do you care about that tree?

247
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:10,512
To me, he's different from all the rest.

248
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:12,112
How so?

249
00:18:14,279 --> 00:18:17,592
The palace is vast, but Father and Mother are always busy.

250
00:18:17,680 --> 00:18:19,640
The palace servants and nannies are always so respectful.

251
00:18:20,519 --> 00:18:23,873
Only he is there to keep me company and listen to me.

252
00:18:25,759 --> 00:18:26,799
Brother.

253
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:29,832
Don't you have someone you wish you could hold on to?

254
00:18:43,599 --> 00:18:45,913
Commissioner Mei, you're always quick on your feet.

255
00:18:47,920 --> 00:18:49,193
How is Yuan Zhen?

256
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:50,999
The imperial physician said she's fine.

257
00:18:54,480 --> 00:18:55,480
This is...

258
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:00,393
Strange sight, isn't it?

259
00:19:01,400 --> 00:19:04,233
How did these poisonous moths fall into the water?

260
00:19:06,686 --> 00:19:07,726
Perhaps

261
00:19:09,599 --> 00:19:10,752
moths are drawn to water?

262
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:15,993
Moths are drawn to flame, never to water.

263
00:19:18,279 --> 00:19:19,352
It smells so sweet.

264
00:19:20,920 --> 00:19:22,913
Actually,

265
00:19:23,880 --> 00:19:25,920
I accidentally spilled this wine into the water.

266
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,000
Wine?

267
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,873
I happened to pass by the Wine Bureau on my way to the Imperial Kitchen.

268
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,193
So, I picked it up.

269
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:36,272
It's all my fault.

270
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:38,512
I didn't even get to drink a sip.

271
00:19:40,680 --> 00:19:42,032
Poisonous moths love sweet things.

272
00:19:43,319 --> 00:19:45,272
That's why they often damage flowers and trees.

273
00:19:45,880 --> 00:19:49,193
The sweet fragrance in the water lured them down.

274
00:19:49,519 --> 00:19:51,752
Once their wings got wet, they couldn't fly.

275
00:19:51,946 --> 00:19:53,578
So they drowned in the pond.

276
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:56,799
It seems the abnormality of the white camellia the palace folk spoke of

277
00:19:56,880 --> 00:19:58,440
was caused by these poisonous moths.

278
00:19:59,559 --> 00:20:01,512
Lady Wu, you've done a good deed.

279
00:20:03,960 --> 00:20:06,233
Young Master, you're so knowledgeable.

280
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:13,960
Alright.

281
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:17,512
Since there is nothing unusual about white camellia,

282
00:20:18,440 --> 00:20:19,913
we have no reason to linger in the palace.

283
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:27,133
(To others, he's just a tree.)

284
00:20:27,559 --> 00:20:31,153
But to me, he's my only friend.

285
00:20:33,519 --> 00:20:34,713
He cannot speak,

286
00:20:35,279 --> 00:20:36,913
yet I've felt his presence.

287
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,233
All these years,

288
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,832
he has been accompanying me and protecting me.

289
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:46,433
He's always there when I need him.

290
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:51,312
Brother, he's different from everyone else.

291
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:53,440
I want to keep him.

292
00:20:57,799 --> 00:20:58,953
You have borne no evil thoughts,

293
00:21:00,148 --> 00:21:01,552
and committed no sins.

294
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,394
Your heart remains as innocent and pure.

295
00:21:10,280 --> 00:21:12,912
But I allow only this once.

296
00:21:54,920 --> 00:21:56,272
Your Highness, we've arrived.

297
00:21:58,079 --> 00:21:59,079
Thank you for the ride.

298
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:07,720
Young Master.

299
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,232
This road wasn't like this before, was it?

300
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:21,233
The old road was muddy and rough, so I had people fix it up.

301
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:25,512
That must have been a lot of work and cost a lot of money.

302
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:30,713
You've just been promoted to Commissioner, but you're already determined.

303
00:22:31,280 --> 00:22:32,680
It has nothing to do with being promoted.

304
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,040
It was because...

305
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:42,160
It was a broken road to begin with and should have been fixed long ago.

306
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,673
How accommodating.

307
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:53,832
Brother Mei, why are you just staring at it?

308
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:54,960
Why aren't you reciting?

309
00:23:57,400 --> 00:23:58,920
The more I recite, the more irritated I get.

310
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,560
So it's useless after all.

311
00:24:24,446 --> 00:24:25,552
(Wuzi Pavilion)

312
00:24:25,656 --> 00:24:28,896
Zhen, I must scold you this time.

313
00:24:29,047 --> 00:24:30,720
I promise it won't happen again.

314
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,072
If I had dragged that white camellia spirit to the Demon Market,

315
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:36,673
he wouldn't have come willingly.

316
00:24:36,833 --> 00:24:38,546
And Yuan Zhen would've been heartbroken.

317
00:24:38,680 --> 00:24:39,680
True.

318
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:44,352
The bond they have shared since childhood cannot be replaced.

319
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:46,880
Cut it out.

320
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,673
Stop putting on a show for me.

321
00:24:50,519 --> 00:24:51,919
The matter of the white camellia spirit

322
00:24:52,839 --> 00:24:53,839
ends here.

323
00:24:54,452 --> 00:24:55,492
No next time.

324
00:24:56,319 --> 00:24:58,512
Wu Zi Shu, why did you summon me here?

325
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:00,520
I have something to report to you, Serpent Lord.

326
00:25:00,839 --> 00:25:02,272
Some time ago, word came that

327
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:06,272
a mortal has been searching for a book on demons and ghosts.

328
00:25:06,360 --> 00:25:08,720
I suspect it's the 'Compendium of Demons' written by the White Serpent

329
00:25:08,799 --> 00:25:10,032
from the previous dynasty.

330
00:25:11,240 --> 00:25:12,752
White Serpent?

331
00:25:14,359 --> 00:25:16,433
Sounds familiar.

332
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,274
Isn't that Serpent Lord's mortal alias 200 years ago?

333
00:25:24,160 --> 00:25:26,160
That book hasn't surfaced for almost 200 years,

334
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:27,752
and someone still remembers it.

335
00:25:28,599 --> 00:25:29,713
They have good taste.

336
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:34,633
But with someone suddenly asking about the book,

337
00:25:35,119 --> 00:25:36,759
I'm worried there might be something more to it.

338
00:25:37,599 --> 00:25:38,993
What's there to be afraid of?

339
00:25:39,799 --> 00:25:41,953
The two sides will have to meet to make the transaction.

340
00:25:42,440 --> 00:25:45,153
When we meet downstairs, we'll know who they are.

341
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,673
If it's the Celestial Master or anyone looking for trouble,

342
00:25:55,079 --> 00:25:56,352
we can just end him.

343
00:25:56,839 --> 00:25:59,032
And if it's just a mortal seeking the book?

344
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:00,673
Then I'll sign him a copy.

345
00:26:08,759 --> 00:26:09,993
What if it's Mei Si himself?

346
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:19,079
She's fast.

347
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,552
Fourth Master Mei.

348
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,392
Mr. Shu, you're the owner of this bookstore.

349
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:33,040
Sister Zhen.

350
00:26:38,839 --> 00:26:40,552
Lady Liu.

351
00:26:41,192 --> 00:26:42,192
Lady Liu.

352
00:26:47,000 --> 00:26:48,233
Why are you raising your voice?

353
00:26:48,599 --> 00:26:50,433
I thought you didn't hear me.

354
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:53,920
What do you want?

355
00:26:54,706 --> 00:26:55,779
I've been thinking…

356
00:26:55,972 --> 00:26:57,725
The reason you don't believe me

357
00:26:58,000 --> 00:27:00,112
must be because you don't know much about demons.

358
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:02,999
So I went around Chang'an and found this old book.

359
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:04,512
I'd like to share it with you.

360
00:27:04,593 --> 00:27:05,713
I don't need it.

361
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:08,752
Need it or not, just hear me out.

362
00:27:09,440 --> 00:27:12,832
They say White Serpent was a famous writer of strange tales 200 years ago.

363
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:14,953
Lady Liu, don't you want to take a look?

364
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:16,959
White Serpent?

365
00:27:17,440 --> 00:27:18,760
- Who is it?   - Haven't heard of him.

366
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,112
Doesn't sound famous.

367
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:21,473
White Serpent?

368
00:27:21,880 --> 00:27:23,552
How could anyone be named White Serpent?

369
00:27:23,799 --> 00:27:25,032
He's not famous.

370
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:27,813
He's very famous.

371
00:27:29,519 --> 00:27:32,552
These three are the best-selling fragrances in our shop.

372
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,873
Lady Liu, Compendium of Demons might seem to be about demons,

373
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:38,000
but if you read it closely,

374
00:27:38,160 --> 00:27:40,193
it includes all kinds of landscapes, customs, human affairs,

375
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,280
and also methods for dealing with all kinds of demons.

376
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:44,792
It's divided into seven chapters.

377
00:27:45,319 --> 00:27:47,713
The first half talks about demons, devils, spirits, and monsters.

378
00:27:47,800 --> 00:27:50,960
The second half covers heaven, earth, mountains, seas, and chaos.

379
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:52,439
And then there's the Wandering Chapter.

380
00:27:52,839 --> 00:27:56,193
The best part is the mountain spirits White Serpent described

381
00:27:56,599 --> 00:28:00,312
are so vivid and lifelike, it's astonishing.

382
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:04,120
Lady Liu.

383
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:08,233
The Wandering Chapter is my favorite.

384
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:11,592
It tells the story of a great demon traveling around the world.

385
00:28:12,079 --> 00:28:13,239
Demons aren't all evil.

386
00:28:13,319 --> 00:28:16,913
Like humans, they can feel joy and affection.

387
00:28:17,119 --> 00:28:19,552
Not every demon harms humans.

388
00:28:21,119 --> 00:28:23,439
But of course, one must never be without caution against demons.

389
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:24,599
Fourth Master Mei.

390
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,832
Tell me about the scariest story in that book.

391
00:28:33,559 --> 00:28:35,473
Lady Liu, you're brave indeed.

392
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:42,393
The scariest would be the tale of the Enchantress Spirit.

393
00:28:44,799 --> 00:28:47,832
Tell me, what's frightening about it?

394
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:52,272
Enchantress Spirit is a kind of spirit.

395
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:55,032
It always appears in the form of a woman,

396
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:59,072
with long, unsettling hair hiding her face.

397
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:02,032
They say the Enchantress Spirit

398
00:29:02,560 --> 00:29:06,073
loves to creep silently behind her victims and,

399
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,592
when they're not looking, wrap herself around them.

400
00:29:12,200 --> 00:29:16,953
Her fingers are like withered branches,

401
00:29:18,920 --> 00:29:20,112
just like this one.

402
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,273
She reaches straight for the throat.

403
00:29:30,185 --> 00:29:31,225
Is this like this?

404
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:38,153
Get up.

405
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,232
Demon! Lady Liu, run!

406
00:29:41,792 --> 00:29:42,946
- It's me.   - Help me!

407
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,640
Ling Xiao.

408
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,800
Mr. Ling Xiao?

409
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,274
Lady Liu is just teasing you.

410
00:29:53,839 --> 00:29:55,352
You're so annoying!

411
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:57,193
So easily frightened.

412
00:29:57,279 --> 00:29:58,631
Don't I have any dignity?

413
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,080
Fourth Master Mei.

414
00:30:02,880 --> 00:30:04,512
After all this pestering today,

415
00:30:05,240 --> 00:30:07,433
I think I understand what you're getting at.

416
00:30:07,720 --> 00:30:09,153
But I have to tell you,

417
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,753
I'm not afraid of any demonic stories,

418
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:14,873
and I won't go exorcising anything.

419
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:20,880
The world of demons and spirits is strange

420
00:30:20,960 --> 00:30:22,193
and fascinating.

421
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:24,753
Why should I avoid it?

422
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:27,240
In other words,

423
00:30:28,200 --> 00:30:30,352
Lady Liu, you're interested in demons?

424
00:30:30,839 --> 00:30:32,352
Although you don't like reading,

425
00:30:33,279 --> 00:30:36,272
your painting skills are second to none in Chang'an.

426
00:30:38,319 --> 00:30:43,552
My little hobby is nothing compared to you.

427
00:30:45,480 --> 00:30:47,592
We are worlds apart.

428
00:30:48,360 --> 00:30:50,232
Our paths don't cross, and we have no common ground.

429
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:53,913
From now on, don't trouble yourself with me.

430
00:30:55,080 --> 00:30:56,080
Ling Xiao.

431
00:30:57,205 --> 00:30:58,205
See him out.

432
00:30:59,126 --> 00:31:00,126
Alright.

433
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:01,960
Wait, you're interested in The Compendium of Demons.

434
00:31:02,119 --> 00:31:04,400
- Lady Liu, I still have so many stories to share.   - Come on.

435
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:05,800
- No.   - Closing time.

436
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,640
White Serpent's stories are fascinating!

437
00:31:07,720 --> 00:31:09,160
Let me go! Lady Liu!

438
00:31:09,240 --> 00:31:11,312
- Go.   - Lady Liu.

439
00:31:13,240 --> 00:31:16,193
Little snake.

440
00:31:17,400 --> 00:31:20,800
I'm going to tie you in a dead knot.

441
00:31:20,994 --> 00:31:21,994
You...

442
00:31:22,440 --> 00:31:23,480
Did that scare you?

443
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:27,153
Don't you think you're going too far in bullying Si?

444
00:31:28,319 --> 00:31:29,393
I know what I'm doing.

445
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:35,879
And I know exactly who pushed Fourth Master Mei into pestering me.

446
00:31:40,039 --> 00:31:42,080
It was me. I admit it.

447
00:31:42,160 --> 00:31:43,272
Step aside!

448
00:31:43,520 --> 00:31:44,520
- Get out!   - Serpent Lord.

449
00:31:44,920 --> 00:31:47,313
- Kitten, come out!   - I'm already out. I'm not hiding.

450
00:31:47,400 --> 00:31:48,713
You're not hiding?

451
00:31:49,039 --> 00:31:50,881
- You'll face karma.   - What karma?

452
00:31:50,961 --> 00:31:52,281
Serpent Lord, let it go. Serpent Lord.

453
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:55,640
Your karma is here.

454
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:01,194
Looks like we'll be able

455
00:32:02,519 --> 00:32:03,752
to see heavenly thunder tonight.

456
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:21,473
How can this trap hold me?

457
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:25,400
You're a half-human, half-demon monster.

458
00:32:25,480 --> 00:32:27,193
How dare you call yourself Cat Lord?

459
00:32:27,480 --> 00:32:29,913
What gives you the right to rule the Demon Market?

460
00:32:32,279 --> 00:32:33,279
Indeed.

461
00:32:34,198 --> 00:32:35,592
What gives her the right?

462
00:32:36,319 --> 00:32:38,640
Who is it? Who are you?

463
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,200
Me?

464
00:32:41,680 --> 00:32:43,433
A demon who can help you.

465
00:32:44,400 --> 00:32:45,400
Come here.

466
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:10,272
Let me out!

467
00:33:10,640 --> 00:33:12,752
Let me out!

468
00:33:13,200 --> 00:33:14,993
Shut your mouth! Stop making noise!

469
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:16,407
Stop making noise!

470
00:33:20,119 --> 00:33:22,393
I don't want to be locked up here.

471
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,272
I don't want to be trapped here.

472
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,233
Detained for hundreds of years.

473
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,752
Escaped from the Demon Prison and dragged back time and again.

474
00:33:54,640 --> 00:33:56,393
You must be Xuan Hui.

475
00:33:57,640 --> 00:33:59,633
You got here fast.

476
00:34:01,960 --> 00:34:05,752
This Demon Prison was built by the first two Lords with my help.

477
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,793
I'm very familiar with its mechanisms.

478
00:34:10,679 --> 00:34:12,632
I know you hate the Cat Lord.

479
00:34:13,519 --> 00:34:14,993
If you can help me get out,

480
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,592
I can help you with this matter.

481
00:34:22,231 --> 00:34:24,032
You help me?

482
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:27,112
Isn't it that little half-human, half-demon girl?

483
00:34:27,679 --> 00:34:30,753
She was the one who captured me the last time I escaped.

484
00:34:31,599 --> 00:34:34,592
I have a score to settle with her too.

485
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,753
I see.

486
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:40,833
I do remember that incident.

487
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
I heard that

488
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:45,873
although you were ordered to reflect in the Demon Prison,

489
00:34:46,440 --> 00:34:48,273
you're still an elder of the Gray Sect.

490
00:34:50,199 --> 00:34:51,913
Your hearing is quite good.

491
00:34:52,599 --> 00:34:55,353
Being an elder means you have to be cautious

492
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:57,112
and weigh your actions carefully.

493
00:34:57,400 --> 00:34:58,512
But I'm different.

494
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,433
I have no reservations about going after her.

495
00:35:02,639 --> 00:35:04,799
So, do we have a deal?

496
00:35:06,198 --> 00:35:08,792
This Demon Prison is heavily guarded.

497
00:35:09,039 --> 00:35:12,473
I'm afraid there's no way to get out.

498
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,680
I haven't finished.

499
00:35:17,559 --> 00:35:18,800
Fortunately tonight,

500
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:21,280
the two Lords of the Demon Market will use the power of heavenly thunder

501
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,552
to destroy an evil thing.

502
00:35:22,639 --> 00:35:26,559
To do so, they must tear open a small crack in the barrier

503
00:35:26,639 --> 00:35:28,152
to let the heavenly thunder in.

504
00:35:28,320 --> 00:35:31,953
I can use the power of the heavens to greatly increase my demonic power,

505
00:35:32,039 --> 00:35:34,280
and then I can break this prison door

506
00:35:34,360 --> 00:35:36,592
and you'll have your chance to escape.

507
00:35:46,199 --> 00:35:47,753
Hundreds of years of imprisonment

508
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:52,152
and countless failed escapes,

509
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:54,320
all repaid at last…

510
00:35:56,480 --> 00:35:57,712
It's a deal.

511
00:36:12,760 --> 00:36:16,200
This was indeed a decision I made on my own.

512
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:17,960
I assume the case file

513
00:36:18,818 --> 00:36:20,618
has been sent to the Arcane Appraisal Bureau by now.

514
00:36:20,992 --> 00:36:22,032
Your Majesty,

515
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,592
the former Commissioner of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau, Xu Luan,

516
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,032
was not a capable man.

517
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:33,760
I was worried and so I advised you to reclaim the file.

518
00:36:35,480 --> 00:36:38,833
By contrast, Mei Zhu Yu has proven his ability,

519
00:36:39,079 --> 00:36:41,393
whether it's from the western outskirts case

520
00:36:41,679 --> 00:36:46,239
or his work since entering the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

521
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:52,712
Your Majesty, this file rightfully belongs to the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

522
00:36:53,039 --> 00:36:57,192
Since that's the case, why not return it to its proper place?

523
00:36:57,760 --> 00:37:00,192
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau has only changed its head.

524
00:37:01,159 --> 00:37:02,192
Do you truly believe

525
00:37:03,199 --> 00:37:06,993
that he can shoulder this responsibility?

526
00:37:07,920 --> 00:37:10,712
I believe he is a man of integrity and discipline

527
00:37:11,320 --> 00:37:12,560
who doesn't seek fame or fortune.

528
00:37:13,199 --> 00:37:14,592
He is someone we can entrust this to.

529
00:37:26,360 --> 00:37:30,993
It has been a long time since I've seen you praise anyone so highly.

530
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:34,552
It seems this brother-in-law is truly something else.

531
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,712
Your Majesty still jokes at such a time?

532
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:43,314
I'm just speaking my mind.

533
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:47,993
What Lord Mei said is true.

534
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:53,712
Past unsolved cases may be related to today's case.

535
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:58,034
If that heavenly fire from 18 years ago truly was not a natural occurrence,

536
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:01,034
then we should face it.

537
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,833
If we just evade it, like Xu Luan did,

538
00:38:04,920 --> 00:38:09,232
how can we ever solve the problem and keep the world at peace?

539
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,634
So Your Majesty had this thought as well.

540
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:19,473
I just haven't been able to make up my mind.

541
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:21,993
I was hesitant,

542
00:38:22,400 --> 00:38:25,592
but thanks to you, Empress, for being so decisive.

543
00:38:26,239 --> 00:38:27,833
To be honest, I also want to know

544
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:32,440
if there are really demons hiding in Chang'an

545
00:38:32,615 --> 00:38:36,929
and if there's truly another world

546
00:38:38,479 --> 00:38:40,200
we don't know about.

547
00:39:03,206 --> 00:39:05,400
Boss, the protection array is ready.
