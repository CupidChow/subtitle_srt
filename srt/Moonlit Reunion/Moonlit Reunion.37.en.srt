00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,954
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,107 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 37)

3
00:01:35,345 --> 00:01:36,680
I want

4
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:40,360
to make a deal with you, Serpent Lord.

5
00:01:48,078 --> 00:01:49,680
Go straight to the point.

6
00:01:56,966 --> 00:01:59,783
I want your scale

7
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:02,240
in exchange for all three of your lives.

8
00:02:02,749 --> 00:02:03,805
What do you think?

9
00:02:03,902 --> 00:02:08,400
So, you were the one who tried to steal my scale.

10
00:02:10,302 --> 00:02:13,863
It's a shame that the snake catcher was useless.

11
00:02:13,943 --> 00:02:17,159
In the end, I still have to make an appearance.

12
00:02:18,702 --> 00:02:21,879
And now, you're affected by sulfur.

13
00:02:22,223 --> 00:02:24,107
If I take it from you forcefully,

14
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,559
people will think that I'm taking advantage of you.

15
00:02:28,262 --> 00:02:31,358
Why don't you agree to the deal?

16
00:02:32,742 --> 00:02:35,279
This way, the three of you won't need to suffer as much.

17
00:02:39,862 --> 00:02:40,999
Fine.

18
00:02:43,943 --> 00:02:44,999
Don't do it.

19
00:02:45,262 --> 00:02:46,318
Don't do it!

20
00:02:49,462 --> 00:02:50,518
No!

21
00:03:02,343 --> 00:03:03,399
Lady Liu!

22
00:03:11,903 --> 00:03:12,959
Master Snake!

23
00:03:14,142 --> 00:03:15,318
- Xuan Hui! - Master Snake!

24
00:03:16,063 --> 00:03:17,119
Xuan Hui!

25
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:19,038
Please stay with us!

26
00:03:21,343 --> 00:03:23,198
Master Snake!

27
00:03:24,022 --> 00:03:25,918
You're a grown-up, you know?

28
00:03:28,343 --> 00:03:29,399
Why are you crying?

29
00:03:30,943 --> 00:03:32,198
Stop crying.

30
00:03:33,503 --> 00:03:34,598
Master Snake!

31
00:03:46,383 --> 00:03:47,559
Big Sister.

32
00:03:48,783 --> 00:03:50,038
What did you call me?

33
00:03:55,542 --> 00:03:57,399
I just wanted to prove myself.

34
00:04:00,142 --> 00:04:02,239
I'm not a useless fool.

35
00:04:02,663 --> 00:04:03,703
I know that.

36
00:04:03,783 --> 00:04:06,159
I'm not a useless fool.

37
00:04:19,462 --> 00:04:21,518
Master Snake!

38
00:04:21,823 --> 00:04:23,142
Master Snake!

39
00:04:23,222 --> 00:04:24,838
Please wake up!

40
00:04:52,702 --> 00:04:54,679
Boss, we've arrived.

41
00:05:38,142 --> 00:05:40,799
Lady Wu, why didn't you open the door when you were inside?

42
00:05:45,782 --> 00:05:47,062
I'm too lazy to get off the bed.

43
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,599
I've finished the complaint letter for you.

44
00:05:51,462 --> 00:05:53,518
I assume you're too lazy to finish them.

45
00:05:54,133 --> 00:05:56,213
I have no choice but to make an exception this time.

46
00:05:57,462 --> 00:06:01,599
Mr. Mei, since you've already done it, I'm sure you'll do it again.

47
00:06:25,303 --> 00:06:26,359
Your Highness.

48
00:06:26,762 --> 00:06:28,682
Commissioner Mei wrote to you.

49
00:06:28,823 --> 00:06:30,398
He said he would take some days off.

50
00:06:30,662 --> 00:06:33,262
He instructed me to be the interim commissioner until his return.

51
00:06:33,743 --> 00:06:38,439
However, I only realized how tough his job was after assuming his position.

52
00:06:38,943 --> 00:06:41,638
I have no idea how he can deal with all these messy matters

53
00:06:41,863 --> 00:06:45,198
in an orderly and timely manner.

54
00:06:45,614 --> 00:06:46,654
Indeed.

55
00:06:46,743 --> 00:06:48,863
Mei instructed me to assist the interim commissioner.

56
00:06:49,222 --> 00:06:50,999
Even so, it felt like everything was a mess.

57
00:06:51,462 --> 00:06:52,518
I agree.

58
00:06:53,102 --> 00:06:57,119
He has a knack for making difficult tasks look easy.

59
00:06:58,623 --> 00:06:59,679
But I...

60
00:07:01,743 --> 00:07:03,479
You guys don't need to worry too much.

61
00:07:05,101 --> 00:07:07,101
You see, no matter how difficult the situation is,

62
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,525
he'll never show it to anyone else.

63
00:07:11,543 --> 00:07:13,718
He always looked calm and indifferent.

64
00:07:16,662 --> 00:07:19,542
However, since he has entrusted the Arcane Appraisal Bureau to you guys,

65
00:07:20,983 --> 00:07:22,638
that means he believes in your abilities.

66
00:10:03,862 --> 00:10:05,239
Your Highness?

67
00:10:05,663 --> 00:10:06,839
Your Highness, you're back.

68
00:10:09,568 --> 00:10:12,568
You guys didn't write any letters to me after returning to Quzhou.

69
00:10:12,702 --> 00:10:14,158
I was worried, you know?

70
00:10:15,342 --> 00:10:17,022
I even lost weight from worrying too much.

71
00:10:17,868 --> 00:10:20,788
But since the New Year is two days away,

72
00:10:20,943 --> 00:10:23,224
I thought you guys would come back during New Year's Eve.

73
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:25,982
Your Highness, what do you guys wish to have on New Year's Eve?

74
00:10:27,423 --> 00:10:28,479
Wait a minute.

75
00:10:28,943 --> 00:10:30,918
Your Highness, why did you return alone?

76
00:10:31,342 --> 00:10:32,518
Where's Young Master?

77
00:10:34,102 --> 00:10:35,158
Yeah.

78
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:37,863
Where's my husband?

79
00:10:37,943 --> 00:10:38,999
Boss!

80
00:10:40,263 --> 00:10:41,319
Boss!

81
00:10:41,543 --> 00:10:42,599
What's the matter?

82
00:11:48,102 --> 00:11:51,599
Kitty, let's head back.

83
00:11:52,143 --> 00:11:54,263
I'm afraid Chang'an will experience an upheaval soon.

84
00:12:06,222 --> 00:12:07,278
Fourth Master Si.

85
00:12:09,222 --> 00:12:11,758
You're Xuan Hui's best friend in this realm.

86
00:12:13,183 --> 00:12:16,999
I'm sure he's willing to stay with you.

87
00:12:19,198 --> 00:12:23,094
Please find a good spot for him

88
00:12:24,303 --> 00:12:25,959
and bury him there.

89
00:12:38,543 --> 00:12:39,599
Miss Zhen.

90
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:44,999
Please

91
00:12:48,222 --> 00:12:49,558
be careful.

92
00:12:52,823 --> 00:12:53,879
We will.

93
00:13:38,102 --> 00:13:40,158
My Lady, you've finally returned.

94
00:13:41,102 --> 00:13:42,158
Are you okay?

95
00:13:42,462 --> 00:13:43,982
I think you should head back and rest.

96
00:13:44,183 --> 00:13:45,239
I'm fine.

97
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,398
I'll be fine after some rest.

98
00:13:48,183 --> 00:13:50,343
Ling Xiao, Hu Zhu, relay my orders.

99
00:13:50,423 --> 00:13:53,039
Tighten the security at the Demon City's entrance from this moment onward.

100
00:13:53,063 --> 00:13:54,919
Do not allow that old rat to gain access again.

101
00:13:54,943 --> 00:13:55,999
Yes, My Lady.

102
00:13:56,582 --> 00:13:58,528
Our enemies are lurking in the dark while we're out in the open.

103
00:13:58,552 --> 00:14:00,199
We cannot afford to be reckless.

104
00:14:00,423 --> 00:14:01,678
Rest and recuperate.

105
00:14:02,102 --> 00:14:05,038
We'll decide what to do after we've got a clear grasp of their actions.

106
00:14:05,943 --> 00:14:06,999
All right.

107
00:14:08,303 --> 00:14:10,229
- Look after your mistress. - Understood.

108
00:14:10,502 --> 00:14:12,999
My Lady, please be careful.

109
00:14:31,663 --> 00:14:33,678
Boss, don't worry.

110
00:14:34,102 --> 00:14:37,038
We have kept up our patrols throughout this time.

111
00:14:37,382 --> 00:14:40,079
It didn't seem like the lesser demons were behaving strangely.

112
00:14:41,742 --> 00:14:42,798
Zhen.

113
00:14:45,702 --> 00:14:46,758
Shu.

114
00:14:48,222 --> 00:14:50,518
Do you finally remember me?

115
00:14:50,891 --> 00:14:52,067
Indeed. I...

116
00:14:54,263 --> 00:14:55,438
I remembered everything.

117
00:14:56,183 --> 00:14:57,239
So,

118
00:14:57,502 --> 00:15:00,758
what has Changxi Palace done to help you recover your memory?

119
00:15:01,702 --> 00:15:02,959
I'm not sure either.

120
00:15:03,622 --> 00:15:05,638
The sect is mystical and mysterious.

121
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:08,758
It's normal for them to have arts and artifacts that are unbeknownst to us.

122
00:15:11,862 --> 00:15:12,918
Wait for me.

123
00:15:20,303 --> 00:15:21,359
Here.

124
00:15:23,543 --> 00:15:24,599
Here you go.

125
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:33,726
Shu.

126
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:34,839
Within the Demon City,

127
00:15:34,943 --> 00:15:36,737
there are certain forbidden grounds that one can only access

128
00:15:36,761 --> 00:15:39,359
with the Cat Lord's blood or the Serpent Lord's scale.

129
00:15:39,582 --> 00:15:40,638
What are the venues?

130
00:15:42,103 --> 00:15:45,438
Demon Lord Shrine, Demon Refuge Island, Court of Spirit,

131
00:15:45,622 --> 00:15:48,158
Treasury, and the lowest level of Demon Prison.

132
00:15:48,862 --> 00:15:50,278
That's about it.

133
00:15:50,823 --> 00:15:53,078
But you've instructed me to investigate all these venues.

134
00:15:53,102 --> 00:15:54,438
There was nothing off about them.

135
00:15:55,063 --> 00:15:57,719
You investigated them, and there was nothing off about them, huh?

136
00:15:59,263 --> 00:16:00,319
Something's not right.

137
00:16:00,823 --> 00:16:01,879
What's the matter?

138
00:16:02,702 --> 00:16:05,599
I remember there's an abandoned warehouse by the old marketplace.

139
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:08,158
Was it established by the pioneering lords?

140
00:16:08,263 --> 00:16:09,319
Indeed.

141
00:16:09,582 --> 00:16:11,758
It's been abandoned for many years.

142
00:16:12,222 --> 00:16:13,678
No one has been there for ages.

143
00:16:14,303 --> 00:16:18,678
If that's the case, that means no one knows what is hidden there.

144
00:17:53,023 --> 00:17:54,478
There's nothing over here.

145
00:17:54,942 --> 00:17:58,759
Boss, did we come to the wrong place?

146
00:18:00,703 --> 00:18:01,759
That can't be.

147
00:18:02,783 --> 00:18:05,478
I have a hunch that this is the place.

148
00:18:06,303 --> 00:18:07,423
Let's explore it thoroughly.

149
00:18:58,182 --> 00:18:59,238
Is this...

150
00:19:02,263 --> 00:19:03,398
Sinister Fiend Infant?

151
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:30,599
What's going on?

152
00:19:35,263 --> 00:19:37,503
Did the Demon City originate from Sinister Fiend Infant?

153
00:19:41,622 --> 00:19:45,759
I assume this is the very first council hall.

154
00:19:53,902 --> 00:19:56,359
(Strange. Where's the item?)

155
00:19:58,156 --> 00:20:01,772
(Darned rat. I even helped to revive you.)

156
00:20:02,063 --> 00:20:03,799
(How dare you deceive me?)

157
00:20:33,063 --> 00:20:35,438
(Where exactly is that old rat hiding?)

158
00:21:06,102 --> 00:21:07,998
Elder Gray, are you here to buy books as well?

159
00:21:09,783 --> 00:21:13,398
Lord Shu, you did catch me off guard.

160
00:21:18,503 --> 00:21:20,478
Did you visit the old warehouse yesterday?

161
00:21:20,823 --> 00:21:22,958
Lord Shu, you're being so serious here.

162
00:21:23,142 --> 00:21:25,478
You didn't even ask me how I was doing.

163
00:21:26,303 --> 00:21:27,359
Ridiculous.

164
00:21:28,102 --> 00:21:31,638
You wounded Serpent Lord and caused a huge commotion.

165
00:21:32,263 --> 00:21:34,223
Do you still need me to ask you how you're doing?

166
00:21:35,182 --> 00:21:37,079
Lord Shu, you're resourceful indeed.

167
00:21:37,942 --> 00:21:41,998
I assume you had your own plans yesterday.

168
00:21:44,382 --> 00:21:45,958
We were supposed to join hands.

169
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:48,958
However, you took that item away beforehand.

170
00:21:49,223 --> 00:21:50,638
And, you even put the blame on me.

171
00:21:51,983 --> 00:21:54,383
Lord Shu, you were always unpredictable.

172
00:21:54,463 --> 00:21:59,158
I took that item in order to protect myself.

173
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:00,599
I told you before.

174
00:22:01,063 --> 00:22:04,559
I don't care what you'll do to the Mortal Realm or the Demon City.

175
00:22:04,902 --> 00:22:07,678
I just need to borrow its power to take Zhen with me.

176
00:22:11,182 --> 00:22:12,238
Lord Shu.

177
00:22:12,703 --> 00:22:14,559
You haven't even seen that item before.

178
00:22:15,102 --> 00:22:19,342
Are you sure that it's vital to our plan?

179
00:22:19,422 --> 00:22:20,678
It's an easy prediction.

180
00:22:21,543 --> 00:22:25,279
The Sinister Fiend Infant wanted to get its hands on it 18 years ago.

181
00:22:26,382 --> 00:22:28,622
I'm sure it's related to the survival of the Demon City.

182
00:22:32,823 --> 00:22:33,879
Who are you?

183
00:22:42,223 --> 00:22:43,279
Zhen?

184
00:22:44,942 --> 00:22:45,998
It's me.

185
00:22:47,182 --> 00:22:48,599
Lord Qiang Yi.

186
00:22:58,023 --> 00:23:01,943
An ancient military text that helps to strike down opponents

187
00:23:02,023 --> 00:23:04,119
and crush enemy states.

188
00:23:04,303 --> 00:23:07,319
You can name it Qiang Yí.

189
00:23:07,743 --> 00:23:09,519
I recalled that scene time and time again

190
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:12,559
after waking up in Changxi Palace.

191
00:23:13,862 --> 00:23:18,519
I thought that I was hallucinating due to my illness.

192
00:23:20,382 --> 00:23:22,918
But when I strung the past pieces of my memories one by one,

193
00:23:25,622 --> 00:23:27,799
I realized that it was true.

194
00:23:29,783 --> 00:23:30,839
So,

195
00:23:32,263 --> 00:23:33,958
you pretended to be ignorant yesterday

196
00:23:34,223 --> 00:23:37,599
so that you could dupe me and expose me at the right time.

197
00:23:37,902 --> 00:23:39,743
I merely wanted to know the truth.

198
00:23:39,823 --> 00:23:40,879
The truth, huh?

199
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:43,478
This is the truth.

200
00:23:43,743 --> 00:23:45,144
We've known each other since childhood.

201
00:23:45,168 --> 00:23:47,598
Back then, I was weak. I could only engage in empty theorizing.

202
00:23:47,622 --> 00:23:48,798
You may have looked like an important figure,

203
00:23:48,822 --> 00:23:50,238
but you didn't have the power yet.

204
00:23:50,382 --> 00:23:52,270
I devoted my entire being to help you complete your demon transformation.

205
00:23:52,294 --> 00:23:55,310
I wanted you to establish a foothold here and become the perfect Cat Lord!

206
00:23:56,102 --> 00:23:57,998
That's the truth you've been seeking.

207
00:23:59,543 --> 00:24:01,238
Why did you betray me, then?

208
00:24:04,182 --> 00:24:05,238
That's not it.

209
00:24:06,063 --> 00:24:07,383
You were the one who betrayed me.

210
00:24:08,182 --> 00:24:09,879
I fancied you so much.

211
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,799
I did everything for your sake.

212
00:24:13,102 --> 00:24:15,079
Isn't this everything you needed?

213
00:24:15,503 --> 00:24:16,718
Everything I needed?

214
00:24:19,263 --> 00:24:21,583
You knew that you weren't supposed to do all these things.

215
00:24:22,023 --> 00:24:23,918
Now, you're saying that I needed them?

216
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:27,718
Was it necessary for me to revive Elder Gray?

217
00:24:29,063 --> 00:24:31,638
Was it necessary for me to set up a trap for Serpent Lord?

218
00:24:33,102 --> 00:24:34,680
Was it necessary for me to acquire her snake scale?

219
00:24:34,704 --> 00:24:35,960
Was it necessary for me to murder the innocent?

220
00:24:35,984 --> 00:24:37,360
I didn't need any of that!

221
00:24:40,382 --> 00:24:44,438
Your love disgusts me.

222
00:24:54,382 --> 00:24:57,398
What other ulterior motives do you and Elder Gray have?

223
00:25:02,182 --> 00:25:05,782
I think the Gray Sect has already taken control of the Demon City.

224
00:25:05,862 --> 00:25:08,319
The Sinister Fiend Infant will be revived tonight.

225
00:25:08,902 --> 00:25:10,502
There's no way you can stop its revival.

226
00:25:10,543 --> 00:25:13,063
It doesn't matter even if Chang'an is destroyed in the process.

227
00:25:13,582 --> 00:25:14,918
I'll go to your rescue.

228
00:25:19,023 --> 00:25:22,519
If you stay with me like the good girl you are for the past 18 years,

229
00:25:22,662 --> 00:25:24,678
I'll keep guarding you and protecting you.

230
00:25:25,182 --> 00:25:27,918
You're the safest when you're with me.

231
00:25:28,263 --> 00:25:29,478
I don't need that.

232
00:25:30,063 --> 00:25:31,582
I don't need such protection.

233
00:25:31,662 --> 00:25:33,079
I will never need it!

234
00:25:51,983 --> 00:25:53,039
How could this be?

235
00:25:53,622 --> 00:25:55,302
Have you already turned into a full demon?

236
00:26:01,743 --> 00:26:05,599
My dear Zhen, you're finally a complete demon.

237
00:26:15,983 --> 00:26:17,958
It seems you no longer need me.

238
00:26:21,342 --> 00:26:22,519
Save your breath.

239
00:26:22,703 --> 00:26:24,567
An ancient military text tainted with delusional intent

240
00:26:24,591 --> 00:26:26,279
should be kept hidden forever

241
00:26:27,223 --> 00:26:28,879
instead of appearing in the world.

242
00:26:30,862 --> 00:26:32,039
If that's the case...

243
00:27:03,983 --> 00:27:05,039
Shu!

244
00:27:05,942 --> 00:27:06,998
Shu!

245
00:27:09,063 --> 00:27:10,119
Shu!

246
00:27:12,342 --> 00:27:14,678
Why didn't you avoid my attack?

247
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:16,559
Why did you do that?

248
00:27:17,342 --> 00:27:18,398
Zhen.

249
00:27:20,422 --> 00:27:22,039
If you no longer need me,

250
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:24,119
it's pointless no matter if

251
00:27:24,983 --> 00:27:26,478
I assume the identity of Qiang Yi

252
00:27:28,023 --> 00:27:29,678
or Wu Zi Shu.

253
00:27:35,342 --> 00:27:36,398
No!

254
00:27:37,342 --> 00:27:38,398
No!

255
00:27:40,942 --> 00:27:42,198
This isn't the ending I want!

256
00:28:14,023 --> 00:28:16,238
Shu, do you like this place?

257
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:17,718
I do.

258
00:29:23,263 --> 00:29:24,319
I...

259
00:29:24,823 --> 00:29:25,879
I sense a sinister aura.

260
00:29:51,063 --> 00:29:53,119
You've finally returned.

261
00:29:59,474 --> 00:30:00,542
Show yourself!

262
00:30:00,622 --> 00:30:02,079
Cat Lord,

263
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,143
I've been waiting for you.

264
00:30:04,223 --> 00:30:05,599
Where are the rest of the people?

265
00:30:06,342 --> 00:30:08,279
Why don't you take a guess?

266
00:30:08,743 --> 00:30:12,039
Gray Rat, stop playing tricks here.

267
00:30:12,303 --> 00:30:16,638
Come out and fight me if you dare.

268
00:30:17,582 --> 00:30:19,879
Killing the lesser demons here doesn't prove anything!

269
00:30:20,503 --> 00:30:21,559
Fine.

270
00:30:21,942 --> 00:30:24,879
Come to the lowest level of the Demon Prison if you wish to save them.

271
00:30:25,543 --> 00:30:27,198
I'm waiting for you.

272
00:31:04,382 --> 00:31:05,718
Don't waste your energy.

273
00:31:06,783 --> 00:31:10,839
This cell restrains the demon powers of its captives.

274
00:31:11,463 --> 00:31:14,438
You can't do anything while you're inside.

275
00:31:22,942 --> 00:31:26,638
Elder Gray, long time no see.

276
00:31:27,463 --> 00:31:31,918
It seems you're as sneaky as always.

277
00:31:33,942 --> 00:31:35,838
There's a saying in the Mortal Realm that goes like this,

278
00:31:35,862 --> 00:31:38,358
"A man of great action does not trouble himself with minor prudence."

279
00:31:38,382 --> 00:31:40,278
I'm serving Sinister Lord Infant here.

280
00:31:41,142 --> 00:31:43,119
So what if I'm being sneaky?

281
00:31:43,983 --> 00:31:46,623
Committing despicable deeds is nothing out of the ordinary either.

282
00:31:47,983 --> 00:31:49,039
So what if I do so?

283
00:31:50,223 --> 00:31:54,759
I never knew that you were somehow related to Sinister Fiend Infant.

284
00:31:56,142 --> 00:32:00,839
It seems like you've found out about Wu Zi Shu's true identity.

285
00:32:02,182 --> 00:32:06,718
It's a shame that he's a fool who was entangled by the web of love.

286
00:32:07,582 --> 00:32:08,799
But I'm different.

287
00:32:10,223 --> 00:32:11,559
How are you different from him?

288
00:32:14,543 --> 00:32:15,799
1,000 years ago,

289
00:32:16,942 --> 00:32:18,958
I was a weak rat demon.

290
00:32:21,142 --> 00:32:25,519
The mortals bullied me all they liked.

291
00:32:27,543 --> 00:32:29,599
I had nowhere to go.

292
00:32:55,503 --> 00:32:58,198
That was until I met Sinister Lord Infant.

293
00:32:59,023 --> 00:33:00,398
It took me in.

294
00:33:01,942 --> 00:33:06,519
I was there to witness it when it established the Demon City.

295
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:11,158
It told me that this was my shelter.

296
00:33:11,582 --> 00:33:15,559
It also once told us that mortals were nothing but ants.

297
00:33:17,303 --> 00:33:19,998
They have a short lifespan, and they're feeble.

298
00:33:20,743 --> 00:33:25,158
Although I'm just a rat demon, you guys are narrow-minded beyond belief.

299
00:33:27,463 --> 00:33:28,638
Initially, I thought

300
00:33:29,635 --> 00:33:32,434
you were only unsatisfied that I was the Cat Lord.

301
00:33:32,582 --> 00:33:36,559
I never expected you to be unsatisfied with the entire Demon City.

302
00:33:36,783 --> 00:33:38,519
You wanted to bring peace to both realms, right?

303
00:33:38,543 --> 00:33:39,703
That's wrong!

304
00:33:39,783 --> 00:33:42,423
Demons like us should do whatever we want

305
00:33:42,527 --> 00:33:44,919
instead of being confined to our own corners!

306
00:33:45,000 --> 00:33:46,679
You don't have the Demon City's interest at heart at all.

307
00:33:46,703 --> 00:33:48,663
You're not the Cat Lord.

308
00:33:48,743 --> 00:33:50,223
You don't deserve to be the Cat Lord!

309
00:33:56,142 --> 00:33:57,918
Do you know what this is?

310
00:34:01,223 --> 00:34:02,719
Did you take that from the old warehouse?

311
00:34:02,743 --> 00:34:03,799
Indeed.

312
00:34:04,378 --> 00:34:05,921
This is the origin power

313
00:34:06,001 --> 00:34:09,875
Sinister Lord Infant had hidden when he first came here.

314
00:34:10,303 --> 00:34:13,862
It has absorbed the sinister thoughts of all mortals and demons.

315
00:34:13,942 --> 00:34:15,398
It has an immense power.

316
00:34:16,942 --> 00:34:19,719
Cat Lord, do you know this?

317
00:34:20,743 --> 00:34:24,038
The Demon City is in shambles all because of you!

318
00:34:25,263 --> 00:34:26,398
Listen up.

319
00:34:26,542 --> 00:34:27,934
During the night of the New Moon,

320
00:34:28,014 --> 00:34:30,598
the sinister core within you will resurface.

321
00:34:30,862 --> 00:34:34,398
I will borrow this power and destroy Chang'an!

322
00:34:35,982 --> 00:34:38,679
I will greet and receive Sinister Lord Infant.

323
00:34:40,422 --> 00:34:44,998
I will be the biggest contributor of the new world!

324
00:34:47,982 --> 00:34:49,038
Elder Gray!

325
00:34:54,173 --> 00:34:56,196
I wonder how much of your lofty aspiration

326
00:34:56,597 --> 00:34:59,109
can be allocated to the interest of Demon City.

327
00:34:59,942 --> 00:35:02,359
Aren't you doing it for your own selfish desires?

328
00:35:03,942 --> 00:35:07,159
You're doing this just to prove that you aren't a rat demon

329
00:35:08,183 --> 00:35:10,438
that everyone can bully at will.

330
00:35:33,862 --> 00:35:36,239
Serpent Lord, aren't you worried at all?

331
00:35:39,103 --> 00:35:41,879
What's the point of worrying?

332
00:36:16,062 --> 00:36:17,118
Young girl,

333
00:36:18,062 --> 00:36:21,598
I shall entrust the position of Cat Lord to you.

334
00:36:22,022 --> 00:36:24,478
Cat Lord, what's that?

335
00:36:27,062 --> 00:36:29,759
It's a vital position

336
00:36:30,342 --> 00:36:33,879
that has a mission that one can't afford to fail.

337
00:36:42,583 --> 00:36:44,639
I'm afraid I have to let you down.

338
00:36:45,342 --> 00:36:46,598
Why are you saying so?

339
00:36:50,062 --> 00:36:52,598
I failed to become a worthy Cat Lord.

340
00:36:52,862 --> 00:36:56,478
How do you define what's worthy?

341
00:36:58,583 --> 00:37:02,679
When you're at your lowest point,

342
00:37:03,703 --> 00:37:05,478
and you have a dilemma to solve,

343
00:37:06,583 --> 00:37:10,319
by then, you'll find out whether or not you're worthy.

344
00:38:03,703 --> 00:38:04,839
Mei Zhu Yu?

345
00:38:11,143 --> 00:38:12,199
It's useless.

346
00:38:12,542 --> 00:38:15,063
This gate can only be unlocked with demon powers.

347
00:38:15,143 --> 00:38:16,223
Go and find Serpent Lord...

348
00:38:37,862 --> 00:38:39,038
How could this be?

349
00:38:54,623 --> 00:38:56,598
I... I saw you.

350
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,359
What?

351
00:39:08,623 --> 00:39:10,558
That fateful night 18 years ago,

352
00:39:13,183 --> 00:39:14,598
you were there too.

353
00:39:16,902 --> 00:39:18,558
What exactly did you do?

354
00:39:19,776 --> 00:39:22,632
Is there no way for us to get rid of Sinister Fiend Infant?

355
00:39:23,902 --> 00:39:25,918
Sinister Fiend Infant is immortal.

356
00:39:26,422 --> 00:39:29,038
Although we can go against it with demonic or Daoist arts,

357
00:39:29,743 --> 00:39:32,118
there's no way to eradicate its core completely.

358
00:39:33,862 --> 00:39:38,038
My life is coming to an end. I can only impart my powers to her.

359
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:41,998
I will seal its core within her body.

360
00:39:43,103 --> 00:39:46,038
Due to that, she will turn into a demi-demon.

361
00:39:47,183 --> 00:39:49,319
Perhaps one day,

362
00:39:49,848 --> 00:39:51,482
someone will unravel the mystery

363
00:39:51,562 --> 00:39:53,705
and discover a way to kill Sinister Fiend Infant.

364
00:39:54,703 --> 00:39:57,918
But right now, there's no alternative solution.

365
00:39:59,422 --> 00:40:00,478
That's not true.

366
00:40:01,022 --> 00:40:02,639
Perhaps there's an alternative solution.

367
00:40:03,695 --> 00:40:06,030
Seal the Sinister Fiend Infant's core within my body.

368
00:40:07,223 --> 00:40:08,759
That's the best choice.

369
00:41:16,183 --> 00:41:20,078
I'm sure that old rat has caused a lot of trouble while we were imprisoned.

370
00:41:21,315 --> 00:41:24,908
Elders, you all may return and deal with your sect affairs for now.

371
00:41:24,989 --> 00:41:26,829
We shall rendezvous at the council hall later.

372
00:41:28,062 --> 00:41:29,118
Yes, My Lady.

373
00:41:41,942 --> 00:41:42,998
Boss!

374
00:41:44,422 --> 00:41:45,478
Are you okay?

375
00:41:45,862 --> 00:41:46,918
I'm fine.

376
00:41:54,982 --> 00:41:56,222
It's the night of the New Moon.

377
00:41:57,342 --> 00:41:58,998
Its plan is about to begin.
