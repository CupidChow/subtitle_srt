00:01:27,216 --> 00:01:30,928
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,009 --> 00:01:34,000
(Episode 34)

3
00:01:53,238 --> 00:01:54,640
It looks like Mei Si's horse carriage.

4
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,125
It really is.

5
00:01:58,760 --> 00:01:59,823
Si!

6
00:02:00,672 --> 00:02:01,920
Is it you, Si?

7
00:02:05,352 --> 00:02:06,717
Is Mei Si inside?

8
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,166
I think it's your friend?

9
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:13,606
Lady Liu, I...

10
00:02:14,955 --> 00:02:16,240
Coming.

11
00:02:22,120 --> 00:02:23,183
Huang Da Zhuang?

12
00:02:23,639 --> 00:02:24,726
What are you doing?

13
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,406
Mei Si.

14
00:02:29,039 --> 00:02:30,520
Something is wrong with you.

15
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,343
Nothing.

16
00:02:32,479 --> 00:02:34,046
What is wrong with me?

17
00:02:35,039 --> 00:02:38,566
It's early in the morning and you are dressed sloppily.

18
00:02:41,039 --> 00:02:42,166
Is there someone inside?

19
00:02:43,639 --> 00:02:44,702
No.

20
00:02:45,479 --> 00:02:46,542
No one is inside.

21
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,870
We grew up together.

22
00:02:49,951 --> 00:02:51,039
I know you well.

23
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:53,760
You must be hiding something since you look like this.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:55,166
Come on. Tell me.

25
00:02:55,247 --> 00:02:56,289
Who is inside?

26
00:02:56,391 --> 00:02:58,717
No one. I told you there's no one inside.

27
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:02,559
You rejected Lady Liu's marriage.

28
00:03:02,639 --> 00:03:05,085
Who else can you go out with?

29
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,463
Is it

30
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,326
a girl from the brothel?

31
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,645
Stop saying nonsense. Can you not embarrass me in public?

32
00:03:14,759 --> 00:03:16,805
Fine. I'm saying nonsense.

33
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:19,119
Now that Miss Zhen and Commissioner Mei

34
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,645
is traveling south,

35
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:24,525
I'll be in charge of you.

36
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,046
After all, Zhen isn't here.

37
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:28,286
I can't let you go on the wrong path.

38
00:03:29,039 --> 00:03:30,480
Let me see who it is.

39
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:32,600
Huang Da Zhuang. Mr. Huang.

40
00:03:32,680 --> 00:03:33,925
There's no one inside.

41
00:03:34,639 --> 00:03:35,702
There's no one inside?

42
00:03:38,039 --> 00:03:40,519
- What are we doing in Chang'an?   - Catching thieves!

43
00:03:40,599 --> 00:03:43,160
- What should we do if we see a suspicious vehicle?   - Investigate!

44
00:03:43,240 --> 00:03:44,679
See?

45
00:03:44,759 --> 00:03:46,126
I can't help you.

46
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:47,303
Show me.

47
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:49,519
Stop. I said there's no one inside.

48
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:51,040
- Show me.   - There's no one inside.

49
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:52,799
- Are you sure? Let me see.   - No!

50
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:54,359
Why are you arguing over something trivial?

51
00:03:57,571 --> 00:03:58,634
There's really no one?

52
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:01,126
I told you there's no one inside.

53
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,726
Open the curtains and show him.

54
00:04:04,439 --> 00:04:05,502
No one wants to see it.

55
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:08,623
Let's go!

56
00:04:16,480 --> 00:04:17,543
Where is she?

57
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:19,646
My hand is tired. Is that enough?

58
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,325
You left too quickly.

59
00:04:36,279 --> 00:04:38,846
What? Should I stay in the carriage

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:41,086
and let them badmouth me?

61
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,125
Cat Lord is married.

62
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,759
Since you like Mei Si,

63
00:04:48,839 --> 00:04:50,245
why are you pushing him away

64
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:52,046
and not telling him your feelings?

65
00:04:52,480 --> 00:04:53,543
Nonsense!

66
00:04:55,839 --> 00:04:58,046
Who told you that I like him?

67
00:05:00,079 --> 00:05:01,920
Tell me. Who told you that?

68
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,063
Ling Xiao.

69
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:07,766
I'll deal with him in a couple of days.

70
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:12,325
Are you addicted to becoming Mei Si's lobbyist?

71
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,846
Have you become a matchmaker?

72
00:05:16,519 --> 00:05:18,960
I've been treated with respect

73
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,406
by that fool.

74
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:22,319
It's only normal for me to be considerate

75
00:05:22,405 --> 00:05:23,574
before I leave.

76
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:25,623
Leave?

77
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:29,543
Where are you going?

78
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,206
I didn't want to tell you so soon.

79
00:05:38,439 --> 00:05:39,502
I will soon

80
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:41,606
transform into a dragon and ascend to Heaven.

81
00:05:50,199 --> 00:05:51,262
Congratulations.

82
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,846
I don't miss much here

83
00:06:04,519 --> 00:06:06,166
except that fool, Mei Si.

84
00:06:11,014 --> 00:06:12,286
I hope he can fulfill his wish.

85
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:15,526
You want him to fulfill his wish.

86
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:17,885
What does it have to do with me?

87
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,423
Come with me.

88
00:06:25,720 --> 00:06:26,783
Let me show you something.

89
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:47,183
Mei Si is not around.

90
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:56,743
Come.

91
00:06:58,399 --> 00:06:59,462
Come in.

92
00:07:08,439 --> 00:07:10,125
Right. We can use the door.

93
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,286
You've spent too much time with Mei Si.

94
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,766
What is he doing?

95
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:31,766
That fool has been doing this recently.

96
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,005
I don't know where he found this method.

97
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:36,245
He said eating raw chicken hearts

98
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:39,206
for 49 days would turn him into a demon.

99
00:07:39,839 --> 00:07:41,319
In a few days,

100
00:07:41,399 --> 00:07:42,640
he ate all of them

101
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,046
but I almost threw up watching him.

102
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,125
What is this in the cup?

103
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:55,063
Take a guess.

104
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:59,606
He said smelling it often

105
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:01,840
and getting used to the smell of chicken blood,

106
00:08:01,920 --> 00:08:03,966
would make it easier to eat the chicken hearts.

107
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:06,262
Also,

108
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:08,702
two days ago,

109
00:08:08,959 --> 00:08:10,166
it was a full moon night.

110
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:13,286
He insisted I bite his neck.

111
00:08:13,600 --> 00:08:15,640
He said he would turn into a demon after that.

112
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:18,005
Is that written in your "Compendium of Demons"?

113
00:08:21,247 --> 00:08:23,565
Don't let him buy random books from peddlers.

114
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:28,559
- Did you bite him?   - Of course, not.

115
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:29,766
It was so unhygienic.

116
00:08:30,519 --> 00:08:32,845
Later, he wanted to bite me instead.

117
00:08:33,159 --> 00:08:34,805
He wanted a drop of my blood.

118
00:08:34,960 --> 00:08:37,166
I ended up being chased by him the whole night.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,303
- Did you let him bite you?   - I beat him up.

120
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:47,126
In my opinion,

121
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,006
you should deal with him.

122
00:08:49,159 --> 00:08:51,040
He might not look intelligent

123
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:52,766
but I don't think he should behave like a fool.

124
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:05,423
I will

125
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:08,325
soon become a dragon.

126
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:11,805
I have something to request of you.

127
00:09:13,039 --> 00:09:14,646
Clear your name in Demon City?

128
00:09:15,080 --> 00:09:16,205
That's not important.

129
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:18,503
I want to beg you

130
00:09:19,759 --> 00:09:20,925
to come back and meet him often

131
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,766
if you are not too busy in Demon City.

132
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,303
Meeting him once

133
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:26,445
makes him happier.

134
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,965
Mortals have a short lifespan.

135
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,303
I think

136
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:33,886
it's not that easy

137
00:09:34,840 --> 00:09:35,903
to be happy in life.

138
00:09:45,039 --> 00:09:46,605
Everything you say is for his sake

139
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:49,766
yet you say you are not his lobbyist.

140
00:09:52,919 --> 00:09:54,166
I just have

141
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,023
one friend.

142
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:58,406
I can only leave him in your care.

143
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,222
Enough. I'll be leaving.

144
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:08,303
Well,

145
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,503
I'll use the door.

146
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:21,080
(Mei Residence)

147
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:29,423
Who touched my paintings?

148
00:11:35,919 --> 00:11:37,526
Who touched my chicken hearts and chicken blood?

149
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,006
I know you are worried about Boss

150
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:47,925
but the Serpent Lord is right.

151
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,160
Mr. Mei has been treating Boss well.

152
00:11:51,241 --> 00:11:52,767
Nothing will go wrong.

153
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,605
I didn't know how you felt about the Boss previously.

154
00:11:59,080 --> 00:12:00,599
We've been working together for so long.

155
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:01,719
If you had told me sooner,

156
00:12:01,799 --> 00:12:03,565
I could help you put in a good word.

157
00:12:08,759 --> 00:12:10,486
I wasn't teasing you.

158
00:12:10,679 --> 00:12:11,742
Go back.

159
00:12:17,639 --> 00:12:20,766
He is just as pretentious as always.

160
00:12:21,366 --> 00:12:22,618
You don't know what's good for you!

161
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,400
Elder Gray, it has become a habit for you

162
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:50,046
to come here.

163
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:53,126
However, I remember no one can enter this place

164
00:12:53,759 --> 00:12:55,486
without an invitation.

165
00:12:56,639 --> 00:12:59,046
It's too troublesome for me.

166
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,040
Every demon in Demon City thinks I'm dead.

167
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:05,526
If I walk around outside all day,

168
00:13:05,679 --> 00:13:07,406
it's bad for you

169
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:10,085
if someone finds out, Lord Shu.

170
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,303
Why don't you

171
00:13:14,039 --> 00:13:17,920
send me away from Demon City

172
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:21,605
so I can help you from the outside?

173
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:26,046
I am trapped in Demon City

174
00:13:26,360 --> 00:13:29,486
and you want me to release a cunning geezer like you.

175
00:13:31,080 --> 00:13:33,085
If you are going to hurt Zhen,

176
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,725
I'm afraid no one can stop you.

177
00:13:37,080 --> 00:13:39,205
Lord Shu, how can you say that?

178
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:41,046
You revived me.

179
00:13:41,679 --> 00:13:44,565
I will never move on my own

180
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:46,406
and make plans myself.

181
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,303
Is that so?

182
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,445
Why do you need this demon core then?

183
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:09,445
Who are you trying to hurt?

184
00:14:10,679 --> 00:14:12,006
Wu Zi Shu.

185
00:14:13,559 --> 00:14:16,246
You are the Sinister Fiend Infant's confidant.

186
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,760
It's fine even if you are not as ambitious

187
00:14:18,840 --> 00:14:21,126
as your master

188
00:14:21,559 --> 00:14:23,565
but you are always hesitating

189
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:26,565
for a half-demon.

190
00:14:26,799 --> 00:14:28,120
If the Sinister Fiend Infant

191
00:14:28,200 --> 00:14:30,406
finds out how incompetent you are,

192
00:14:31,559 --> 00:14:34,605
he will regret it so much.

193
00:14:35,240 --> 00:14:38,006
Elder Gray, you described me as an awful one

194
00:14:38,679 --> 00:14:40,925
but where were you 18 years ago?

195
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,719
When you were around

196
00:14:43,799 --> 00:14:45,006
during the Demon City attack,

197
00:14:45,759 --> 00:14:47,046
it would be a success.

198
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,965
It seems like you still don't know the Sinister Fiend Infant

199
00:14:53,200 --> 00:14:56,406
as much as I know him despite the years you've served him.

200
00:14:57,559 --> 00:15:00,280
He wasn't trying to attack Demon City

201
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,605
but to reclaim it.

202
00:15:03,480 --> 00:15:06,046
The creator of Chang'an Demon City

203
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:09,486
is the Sinister Fiend Infant.

204
00:15:11,559 --> 00:15:12,622
What?

205
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:17,126
You really don't know this?

206
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:21,046
I've been alive for a millennium.

207
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,085
Back then, this place wasn't called Chang'an.

208
00:15:27,159 --> 00:15:29,766
I was a rat spirit in the mountains.

209
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:33,880
Demons like us were living a good life in the mountains.

210
00:15:33,960 --> 00:15:35,360
Life was good.

211
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:37,360
However, those darned mortals

212
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:39,040
started a war

213
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,319
for their selfish desire

214
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,805
and turned this place into a raging battlefield.

215
00:15:45,519 --> 00:15:46,582
My mountain

216
00:15:47,679 --> 00:15:49,725
was completely ruined.

217
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:53,205
Without these darned mortals,

218
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:55,040
we wouldn't need to hide,

219
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,161
live cautiously and gather in nests

220
00:15:57,241 --> 00:15:58,805
just to protect ourselves.

221
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,685
The Sinister Fiend Infant

222
00:16:03,879 --> 00:16:06,845
created the barrier

223
00:16:06,960 --> 00:16:09,126
and established the Demon City.

224
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,805
He wanted to strengthen the demons and overturn the mortals.

225
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,342
Unfortunately,

226
00:16:16,685 --> 00:16:20,485
The first two lords were despicable.

227
00:16:20,559 --> 00:16:21,679
They controlled Demon City

228
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,959
and took it for themselves.

229
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,599
They drove the Sinister Fiend out

230
00:16:24,679 --> 00:16:26,280
and contributed nothing

231
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:28,000
just like emperors of the mortal realm.

232
00:16:28,080 --> 00:16:31,325
They only wanted to pass down Demon City's authority to their descendants.

233
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,766
No wonder you treat Cat Lord and Serpent Lord without respect.

234
00:16:38,919 --> 00:16:40,246
This is the reason why.

235
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:41,543
That's right.

236
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:43,526
They are nothing

237
00:16:43,879 --> 00:16:45,605
in my opinion.

238
00:16:46,679 --> 00:16:48,085
I've waited a millennium.

239
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,886
I've always waited,

240
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:52,325
hoped,

241
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,965
and remembered.

242
00:16:56,840 --> 00:16:58,286
Until 18 years ago,

243
00:16:59,360 --> 00:17:01,166
the Sinister Fiend finally returned.

244
00:17:04,279 --> 00:17:05,526
You are right.

245
00:17:06,039 --> 00:17:08,120
If I left Demon City that day,

246
00:17:08,200 --> 00:17:11,120
he would never lose to the former Cat Lord.

247
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,125
You are really useless

248
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:15,686
as his confidant.

249
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:17,286
Let me tell you.

250
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:21,405
I'm fine with serving someone

251
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,125
but my master must be worth serving.

252
00:17:29,279 --> 00:17:31,325
For the sake of humans,

253
00:17:31,799 --> 00:17:34,439
the demons have to seal ourselves off

254
00:17:34,519 --> 00:17:35,800
and be trapped here

255
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,845
without knowing anything about the mortal realm.

256
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:40,600
Someone as foolish as they

257
00:17:40,680 --> 00:17:42,320
have no right to rule Demon City!

258
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:44,360
This place is supposed to be ours!

259
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:46,600
I don't give a care about Cat Lords or Serpent Lords.

260
00:17:46,680 --> 00:17:49,959
I must revive the Sinister Fiend Infant

261
00:17:50,039 --> 00:17:52,960
and help him create a new Chang'an that prioritizes demons.

262
00:17:53,040 --> 00:17:57,845
A Chang'an where demons will not be equals to mere mortals!

263
00:18:38,359 --> 00:18:39,422
Brother Lu Yang.

264
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:48,085
This is my wife, Wu Zhen.

265
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,039
This is my fifth martial brother in Changxi Palace, Lu Yang.

266
00:18:52,119 --> 00:18:54,206
He is the best in Changxi Palace when it comes to medicine.

267
00:18:54,680 --> 00:18:55,743
Greetings, Brother Lu Yang.

268
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:03,902
Soon.

269
00:19:07,160 --> 00:19:09,565
Greetings, Sister-in-law.

270
00:19:13,144 --> 00:19:15,230
You are not guarding the waterfall.

271
00:19:15,311 --> 00:19:17,613
It seems like Shuang Jiang hasn't been stealing your fish recently.

272
00:19:22,119 --> 00:19:23,486
Yes.

273
00:19:24,440 --> 00:19:26,046
That's unlike him.

274
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,165
What has he been doing recently?

275
00:19:32,799 --> 00:19:33,862
Got it.

276
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:38,703
Let's go.

277
00:19:40,839 --> 00:19:42,286
He is busy.

278
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:53,085
Don't you have any serious wishes?

279
00:19:54,440 --> 00:19:55,845
Serious?

280
00:19:58,031 --> 00:19:59,377
(Get rich)

281
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,543
Get rich.

282
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,719
You're checking the ledger. Why are you spacing out?

283
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:11,405
Brother Chi Hua, why are you here?

284
00:20:11,559 --> 00:20:12,645
Zhu Yu is back.

285
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:13,862
Brother Mei is back?

286
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:15,486
You're scaring me.

287
00:20:15,640 --> 00:20:16,703
Brother Mei!

288
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:33,645
Is this Zhu Yu's wife?

289
00:20:34,039 --> 00:20:36,645
Not only that. She's also Demon City's Cat Lord.

290
00:20:36,799 --> 00:20:37,862
To be exact,

291
00:20:38,079 --> 00:20:39,926
She's Demon City's Cat Lord who has lost her memory.

292
00:20:40,359 --> 00:20:42,800
Having a demon inside Changxi Palace.

293
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,246
Doesn't it feel strange?

294
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,063
Enough.

295
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,279
Something serious happened to our former sect leader.

296
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,006
Let's not find fault with others.

297
00:20:54,559 --> 00:20:55,686
She's a guest, after all.

298
00:21:08,279 --> 00:21:09,342
Lian Fu.

299
00:21:09,880 --> 00:21:11,365
Why are you hiding so far away?

300
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:12,743
I...

301
00:21:13,759 --> 00:21:15,600
I'm not hiding.

302
00:21:15,680 --> 00:21:16,743
You're not hiding?

303
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,405
Why are you standing over there then?

304
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,102
Come here!

305
00:21:22,519 --> 00:21:23,582
Come here!

306
00:21:27,519 --> 00:21:28,582
You...

307
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:33,686
Brother Lian Fu, what are you doing?

308
00:21:33,871 --> 00:21:36,239
No. What are you afraid of?

309
00:21:36,319 --> 00:21:37,885
Are you afraid of her?

310
00:21:38,160 --> 00:21:40,726
She is pretty. What's so scary about her?

311
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:43,966
I think none of you know her well.

312
00:21:44,160 --> 00:21:47,085
It's all right. She also doesn't know herself well right now.

313
00:21:47,799 --> 00:21:48,862
In that case,

314
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:51,165
she can stay here for a few days.

315
00:21:52,119 --> 00:21:53,885
Changxi Palace has many books.

316
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:55,645
Perhaps there is a cure.

317
00:21:56,319 --> 00:21:57,382
Thank you.

318
00:21:58,480 --> 00:22:01,560
- Well...   - Zhu Yu used to be a member of Changxi Palace.

319
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:03,600
We won't stand by and do nothing.

320
00:22:03,680 --> 00:22:06,046
- No...   - Lady Wu Zhen might be a demon

321
00:22:06,319 --> 00:22:07,766
but there are kind demons too.

322
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:10,246
Don't you know that?

323
00:22:10,519 --> 00:22:11,560
I know, but...

324
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,006
Lady Wu Zhen is a good person.

325
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:15,479
Even if her memory returns, she won't harm us.

326
00:22:15,559 --> 00:22:17,926
I just have one thing to ask!

327
00:22:26,759 --> 00:22:28,405
Are they going to

328
00:22:29,519 --> 00:22:32,446
stay in one or two rooms?

329
00:22:47,640 --> 00:22:49,766
Since she is staying in your old room,

330
00:22:49,920 --> 00:22:51,600
you can stay with Shuang Jiang for now.

331
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,400
It's only separated by a wall.

332
00:22:53,480 --> 00:22:55,085
It's convenient if something happens.

333
00:22:55,759 --> 00:22:56,822
Thank you.

334
00:22:57,119 --> 00:22:59,142
Don't be so polite. We are a family after all.

335
00:23:00,119 --> 00:23:02,239
However, it is a crude room.

336
00:23:02,319 --> 00:23:03,605
Bring more daily necessities

337
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,565
so Wu Zhen can stay comfortably.

338
00:23:06,599 --> 00:23:07,662
Which of you is going?

339
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:09,966
Me! I'll go.

340
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:18,605
Has Lian Fu changed a lot?

341
00:23:18,911 --> 00:23:19,997
Yes.

342
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:21,560
He has been like this since he came back.

343
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,006
He has become so hardworking.

344
00:23:23,920 --> 00:23:26,600
He is probably worried that we might take revenge on him

345
00:23:26,680 --> 00:23:27,966
because he was close to Chang Ming.

346
00:23:29,160 --> 00:23:30,223
You won't.

347
00:23:30,519 --> 00:23:32,999
Yes. If he isn't guilty,

348
00:23:33,079 --> 00:23:34,766
we wouldn't think of that.

349
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,600
Whatever.

350
00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:38,160
The position of sect leader is vacant now.

351
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:40,605
Many duties have been separated among us.

352
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:43,446
It's easier with him helping us.

353
00:23:45,240 --> 00:23:47,645
Shuang Jiang has started managing the accounts after he came back.

354
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:54,263
So,

355
00:23:55,079 --> 00:23:57,165
you are Changxi Palace's Celestial Master

356
00:23:57,319 --> 00:23:59,286
and I am Chang'an Demon City's Cat Lord?

357
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,006
That's really interesting.

358
00:24:04,160 --> 00:24:05,926
Unfortunately, I don't remember anything.

359
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,565
Do I know any demonic spells?

360
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:11,703
Try it.

361
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,125
It's so fun.

362
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:30,102
This is bad.

363
00:25:45,519 --> 00:25:46,966
What is this?

364
00:25:48,632 --> 00:25:50,538
It's probably an array left behind by Brother Chi Hua

365
00:25:50,680 --> 00:25:52,446
when he was practicing.

366
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,463
Here you go.

367
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:09,565
(How did she...)

368
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:01,102
What are you doing?

369
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:02,822
I'm calling you.

370
00:27:02,960 --> 00:27:06,805
I didn't expect it to work.

371
00:27:10,839 --> 00:27:13,125
It's late. Why are you still awake?

372
00:27:15,359 --> 00:27:17,085
The bed is too hard.

373
00:27:19,680 --> 00:27:21,206
I'll get something to pad the bed for you.

374
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:29,526
I just want to have a chat with you.

375
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:42,726
Did you sleep here back then?

376
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:49,565
Is that ugly thing yours?

377
00:27:49,680 --> 00:27:51,365
The ugly doll that's staring at me.

378
00:27:54,366 --> 00:27:56,132
I won against Brother Xiao Mu once.

379
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:59,645
Master made this clay doll for me

380
00:28:00,319 --> 00:28:01,382
as a reward.

381
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,605
Now that I look at it closely, it's quite cute.

382
00:28:12,359 --> 00:28:13,966
I was thinking about

383
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:16,605
what you looked like when you were a child

384
00:28:17,160 --> 00:28:19,046
and what you would do.

385
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:21,622
When I was young?

386
00:28:23,519 --> 00:28:26,885
I practiced martial arts, studied, and slept.

387
00:28:29,240 --> 00:28:30,686
That's really pitiful.

388
00:28:30,839 --> 00:28:32,565
It must be boring.

389
00:28:33,160 --> 00:28:34,223
Is it?

390
00:28:37,839 --> 00:28:40,645
Actually, a boring life isn't pitiful.

391
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,263
I think

392
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:46,405
having a wish

393
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,503
that cannot be fulfilled

394
00:28:52,599 --> 00:28:53,966
is the most pitiful.

395
00:30:15,400 --> 00:30:17,920
You created Heaven, Earth and the Three Realms.

396
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:19,640
People worship you.

397
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:25,720
Now, the ruler of the universe should change hands.

398
00:31:04,439 --> 00:31:05,757
(What did)

399
00:31:05,920 --> 00:31:08,360
(the Satanic Fiend wrote on my body back then?)

400
00:31:20,833 --> 00:31:22,839
I'm sure everyone is awake at this time.

401
00:31:22,940 --> 00:31:24,718
Zhu Yu had a habit of waking up early since young.

402
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:26,246
Shuang Jiang has also been studying early

403
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,920
since he returned from Chang'an.

404
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:29,165
I think he should also be awake.

405
00:31:36,799 --> 00:31:37,862
Good morning.

406
00:31:41,960 --> 00:31:44,686
Did I arrange for you

407
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:47,526
to stay in this room yesterday?

408
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:50,743
No.

409
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,263
Good morning.

410
00:32:05,680 --> 00:32:06,743
Good morning.

411
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,279
This morning, Lu Yang found many fruits

412
00:32:09,359 --> 00:32:10,800
from the mountains.

413
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:12,046
They are in the front yard.

414
00:32:12,359 --> 00:32:13,726
Sister-in-law, you may try them.

415
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:15,686
I think they suit you.

416
00:32:20,110 --> 00:32:21,950
Sure. I couldn't

417
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,726
take a good look at Changxi Palace yesterday anyway.

418
00:32:24,945 --> 00:32:26,504
Changxi Palace is boring.

419
00:32:26,599 --> 00:32:27,686
There's no fun to be had.

420
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:29,439
However, it is quiet

421
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:31,165
and might be different perhaps.

422
00:32:31,519 --> 00:32:33,246
You may walk around the place, Lady Wu Zhen.

423
00:32:43,480 --> 00:32:44,999
Zhu Yu and Sister-in-law

424
00:32:45,079 --> 00:32:46,959
can't separate from each other for even one night.

425
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:48,405
Enough of the nonsense.

426
00:32:50,400 --> 00:32:51,845
I discussed it with Chi Hua.

427
00:32:51,926 --> 00:32:53,212
Lu Yang excels in medicine.

428
00:32:53,293 --> 00:32:54,486
He will try to think of something.

429
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,286
Many books are stored in the archive.

430
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,519
You can have a look

431
00:32:57,599 --> 00:32:58,845
and see if you can find anything.

432
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:09,845
Brother Mei, you wake up so early.

433
00:33:09,960 --> 00:33:11,246
I didn't notice.

434
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:52,926
They were right.

435
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:55,279
Life in Changxi Palace

436
00:33:55,359 --> 00:33:56,885
is indeed boring

437
00:33:57,359 --> 00:33:58,726
and doesn't have much fun.

438
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:10,259
The sword guides the Three Celestial Lights,

439
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:11,886
the will guards Heaven and Earth!

440
00:34:32,816 --> 00:34:34,320
(However, it's special.)

441
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:39,510
I didn't expect

442
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:42,125
Demon City's Cat Lord to behave like this after losing her memory.

443
00:34:43,039 --> 00:34:44,366
Even if she has lost her memory,

444
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:45,966
she is still the same.

445
00:34:47,162 --> 00:34:48,407
If she hadn't lost her memory,

446
00:34:48,488 --> 00:34:50,097
she probably wouldn't have stayed by your side

447
00:34:50,178 --> 00:34:51,848
after what happened in Chang'an.

448
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:54,983
Right now,

449
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,685
I just want her to live well.

450
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:03,526
Zhu Yu, it's a pity.

451
00:35:03,655 --> 00:35:04,879
The sect leader hasn't been elected

452
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:07,680
and you are the most suitable candidate.

453
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:08,823
No.

454
00:35:09,360 --> 00:35:10,423
I'm not.

455
00:35:11,162 --> 00:35:12,486
Once something happens in this world,

456
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,685
traces will be left.

457
00:35:15,400 --> 00:35:16,765
How can the slate be wiped

458
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,085
for me to start all over again?

459
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:21,446
Since the day I chose to leave this place,

460
00:35:22,800 --> 00:35:24,605
I could no longer return to Changxi Palace.

461
00:35:45,719 --> 00:35:47,125
I'm in charge of the archives now.

462
00:35:47,439 --> 00:35:48,684
I'll leave the key in your care.

463
00:35:49,079 --> 00:35:51,205
You may enter this place as you wish.

464
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,725
Even the secret chamber's key is there.

465
00:35:53,679 --> 00:35:54,742
If nothing works,

466
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,199
you may open the secret chamber and we'll turn a blind eye to it.

467
00:35:58,920 --> 00:35:59,983
Thank you.

468
00:36:03,519 --> 00:36:04,645
I still don't get it.

469
00:36:04,760 --> 00:36:05,880
With your talent,

470
00:36:05,960 --> 00:36:08,765
is it really worth it to sacrifice everything for a woman?

471
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:18,662
It is.

472
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:54,823
Well,

473
00:36:55,119 --> 00:36:56,446
do you want to reconsider?

474
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:57,806
Is it really worth it?

475
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:10,943
Mr. Mei.

476
00:37:12,400 --> 00:37:13,463
Having fun?

477
00:37:13,679 --> 00:37:14,742
Yes.

478
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:18,926
Not really.

479
00:37:19,519 --> 00:37:21,645
You won't lose against them.

480
00:37:26,639 --> 00:37:28,085
I don't remember.

481
00:37:28,678 --> 00:37:30,204
I think you won't lose against them, right?

482
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:36,926
No need. You won't lose against them. There's no need to prove it.

483
00:37:55,840 --> 00:37:56,903
Come back.

484
00:37:59,639 --> 00:38:00,702
What a coincidence.

485
00:38:01,159 --> 00:38:02,222
I was just passing by.

486
00:38:02,719 --> 00:38:03,782
Do you believe it?

487
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:06,765
What did you do?

488
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:10,806
I... I'm not doing anything.

489
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:13,142
Does Lady Liu

490
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:16,446
think my way of becoming a demon is too foolish

491
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:18,119
so she wouldn't see me?

492
00:38:18,199 --> 00:38:20,565
I don't think so. You did many foolish things.

493
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:23,605
She wouldn't wait until now to treat you so coldly.

494
00:38:27,559 --> 00:38:28,966
If you don't know why,

495
00:38:29,199 --> 00:38:30,605
just ask her.

496
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:32,559
Of course, I want to find her.

497
00:38:32,639 --> 00:38:34,926
But she's in Demon City and I can't enter.

498
00:38:35,239 --> 00:38:38,165
That's exactly why I'm here to give you some information.

499
00:38:38,719 --> 00:38:40,245
Lady Liu

500
00:38:40,360 --> 00:38:42,720
left Demon City an hour ago

501
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:44,245
and went to Yuzhen Parlour.

502
00:38:45,320 --> 00:38:46,720
You don't have to thank me

503
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:47,886
for what I just told you.

504
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,720
However, the most important thing today

505
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,046
is to tell you...

506
00:38:54,639 --> 00:38:55,966
I'm here to tell you

507
00:38:57,087 --> 00:38:58,348
that I'm going to turn into a dragon

508
00:38:59,239 --> 00:39:00,526
tonight.

509
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:08,205
This batch has just been acquired from Annan.

510
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,434
They are a little different from previous batches.

511
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,063
What do you think

512
00:39:13,559 --> 00:39:14,622
of the smell for this batch?

513
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:16,983
It's decent.

514
00:39:17,360 --> 00:39:18,423
All right.

515
00:39:18,519 --> 00:39:20,400
I'll return to Demon City if there's nothing else.

516
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:21,543
I'll send you off.

517
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,880
Manager,

518
00:39:23,947 --> 00:39:26,313
I heard Fourth Master Mei's horse carriage is rushing here.

519
00:39:28,920 --> 00:39:31,806
He is quite well-informed.

520
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:33,343
I'll use the back door.

521
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:46,182
Wait.

522
00:39:46,719 --> 00:39:49,526
Fourth Master Mei, aren't you at the front door?

523
00:39:50,138 --> 00:39:51,600
My horse carriage is in the front door.

524
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,423
After so many years,

525
00:39:53,599 --> 00:39:55,765
I've known Lady Liu quite well.

526
00:39:56,840 --> 00:39:58,006
Why are you looking for me?

527
00:39:59,239 --> 00:40:00,302
Lady Liu,

528
00:40:00,880 --> 00:40:02,159
I'm here to ask you

529
00:40:02,239 --> 00:40:03,765
what happened.

530
00:40:04,719 --> 00:40:05,800
We had fun

531
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,446
in Qiuchi that day.

532
00:40:10,559 --> 00:40:11,622
It's nothing.

533
00:40:13,239 --> 00:40:14,302
Lady Liu.

534
00:40:15,039 --> 00:40:16,519
I like to fool around usually.

535
00:40:16,599 --> 00:40:18,205
I am ignorant and incompetent

536
00:40:18,559 --> 00:40:19,765
but I'm not a fool.

537
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,926
You are also not someone who changes normally.

538
00:40:23,079 --> 00:40:24,765
Something must have happened.

539
00:40:25,800 --> 00:40:26,966
But no matter what,

540
00:40:27,519 --> 00:40:29,245
you should tell me the reason.

541
00:40:38,599 --> 00:40:39,800
Let's speak inside.
