00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,080
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,169 --> 00:01:33,800
(Episode 35)

3
00:01:34,307 --> 00:01:37,108
(Yuzhen Parlour)

4
00:01:49,319 --> 00:01:50,382
Fourth Master Si.

5
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:53,973
Why do you fancy me?

6
00:01:54,232 --> 00:01:55,295
Why?

7
00:01:56,535 --> 00:01:57,975
What reason could there be for this?

8
00:01:58,879 --> 00:01:59,959
Of course there's a reason.

9
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:03,046
Why do you fancy me?

10
00:02:03,707 --> 00:02:05,712
Since when did you fall for me?

11
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,523
Lady Liu.

12
00:02:08,576 --> 00:02:09,902
We were childhood sweethearts.

13
00:02:10,047 --> 00:02:12,934
I knew that you would be my future bride since childhood.

14
00:02:13,634 --> 00:02:14,919
What other reason is there?

15
00:02:19,561 --> 00:02:20,846
Childhood sweethearts, huh?

16
00:02:24,479 --> 00:02:28,473
I suppose this portrait is a portrait of your childhood sweetheart.

17
00:02:28,815 --> 00:02:29,878
No wonder.

18
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:32,045
I felt like something was missing in my room.

19
00:02:32,236 --> 00:02:34,819
So, you had the portrait with you.

20
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,645
The Liu Tai Zhen whom you first knew,

21
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:45,205
the Liu Tai Zhen you fancied and were engaged to,

22
00:02:46,376 --> 00:02:47,941
I'm not her.

23
00:02:53,759 --> 00:02:56,085
The Liu Tai Zhen, who was your childhood sweetheart,

24
00:02:57,052 --> 00:02:59,058
the Liu Tai Zhen who fancied you,

25
00:02:59,763 --> 00:03:04,525
she died ten years ago.

26
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:15,521
Everyone knew about this.

27
00:03:17,322 --> 00:03:20,208
Lady Liu fell off a cliff by accident when she was still a child.

28
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:22,006
And, she had a close shave.

29
00:03:23,479 --> 00:03:25,566
But has this never occurred to you guys?

30
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:27,616
She's just an ordinary mortal.

31
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:31,126
And, she fell off a cliff.

32
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:35,245
How could she come back to life?

33
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,684
As the Serpent Lord,

34
00:03:40,008 --> 00:03:41,973
I frequently tread the Mortal Realm.

35
00:03:42,199 --> 00:03:44,839
It was inconvenient for me to proceed while using my old identity.

36
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:48,085
Therefore, I borrowed her body.

37
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:54,960
Liu Gong Shen only knew that his daughter had returned in one piece.

38
00:03:56,311 --> 00:03:59,318
He had no idea that we were actually different individuals

39
00:04:00,216 --> 00:04:02,141
even though we may look the same.

40
00:04:06,479 --> 00:04:07,542
But...

41
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:10,326
But Miss Zhen is a demon as well.

42
00:04:11,719 --> 00:04:13,326
But she's still Miss Zhen.

43
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,573
She's an outlier.

44
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:20,445
She became a demon while she was still a human.

45
00:04:22,679 --> 00:04:24,485
Therefore, she's a demi-demon.

46
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:29,622
But my case is different.

47
00:05:13,279 --> 00:05:14,342
It's you, huh?

48
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,046
I thought it was Xiao Mu or Brother Chi Hua.

49
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:30,663
What are you reading?

50
00:05:31,079 --> 00:05:33,537
I stole some martial arts manuals from here.

51
00:05:33,625 --> 00:05:35,072
I'm studying them right now.

52
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:41,626
Not long after this,

53
00:05:42,426 --> 00:05:45,912
I'll become both a cultivator and a demon with immense power.

54
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,046
I'll roam between the two realms as the most powerful demon in the world.

55
00:05:53,854 --> 00:05:54,908
What's the matter?

56
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:58,026
I'm going to steal the arts of Changxi Palace.

57
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,565
Why aren't you panicking?

58
00:06:02,571 --> 00:06:03,756
You can learn them all you like.

59
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,131
Ask me if you have any questions. I'll teach you.

60
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:08,526
Are you belittling me here?

61
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:13,300
These Daoist arts and demonic arts are fundamentally opposed.

62
00:06:13,455 --> 00:06:14,518
They cannot be merged.

63
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,325
If you do learn them both, you'll be a pioneer.

64
00:06:20,543 --> 00:06:22,870
I'm the Cat Lord of Chang'an, right?

65
00:06:23,232 --> 00:06:29,160
Who knows? Maybe I'm a rare genius.

66
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,720
So, you...

67
00:06:49,959 --> 00:06:51,086
You aren't her, huh?

68
00:06:52,496 --> 00:06:53,559
You're not her.

69
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:00,663
I'm sorry.

70
00:07:03,439 --> 00:07:05,279
I shouldn't have hidden the truth for so long.

71
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:10,009
I thought

72
00:07:11,306 --> 00:07:14,873
the bonds between mortals were fleeting.

73
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:17,640
I thought you would fall for someone else easily

74
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:20,066
as long as I ignored you.

75
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
- You thought, huh? - I thought...

76
00:07:24,839 --> 00:07:28,805
How could a demon like you know the feelings of a mortal?

77
00:07:31,480 --> 00:07:33,245
What gives you the right to judge us?

78
00:07:38,439 --> 00:07:43,406
No wonder Lady Liu became an entirely different person ten years ago.

79
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:46,456
She ignored me all of a sudden.

80
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,526
I thought that I'd done something to irk her.

81
00:07:51,221 --> 00:07:52,866
I would've never expected

82
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,885
that you weren't Lady Liu at all.

83
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:12,304
Return Lady Liu to me.

84
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,646
Take your time to observe and learn.

85
00:09:28,527 --> 00:09:30,773
How is it? Have you gotten a reply from her?

86
00:09:32,072 --> 00:09:33,792
Or did she send you home with her scolding?

87
00:09:35,879 --> 00:09:38,046
You should've gotten used to it by now.

88
00:09:50,966 --> 00:09:53,063
Forget it. Let's drop the topic.

89
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:56,406
I came here today because I have good news for you.

90
00:09:56,600 --> 00:09:57,800
- I... - I want to be alone.

91
00:12:02,559 --> 00:12:03,886
Rain Dragon of Chang'an.

92
00:12:06,080 --> 00:12:08,720
Are you here to overcome your trial and ascend to greater heights?

93
00:12:08,904 --> 00:12:09,967
That's right!

94
00:12:10,159 --> 00:12:14,605
Before one's ascension, all Rain Dragons must go through this trial.

95
00:12:15,235 --> 00:12:18,882
We will start if you are ready.

96
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:20,519
I'm ready.

97
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:21,766
I'm ready!

98
00:14:06,722 --> 00:14:07,785
What's wrong?

99
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:09,560
Why haven't I turned into a Rain Dragon?

100
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:12,805
Naturally, you didn't pass the trial.

101
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,480
I suppose you do have dragon scales now.

102
00:14:15,856 --> 00:14:18,502
However, you are bound by worldly desires and affairs.

103
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:22,125
There are certain things you need to give up on

104
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:24,774
in order to turn into a Rain Dragon.

105
00:14:28,702 --> 00:14:29,765
Take a bite.

106
00:14:30,787 --> 00:14:34,008
Darned mortal. Do I look like a vegetarian to you?

107
00:14:35,255 --> 00:14:36,318
You must be afraid of me.

108
00:14:36,668 --> 00:14:39,886
Puny mortal, how dare you not kneel in front of my presence?

109
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,729
I can forgive you for being obsessed with drawing in the past.

110
00:14:44,879 --> 00:14:46,085
But now?

111
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:49,725
You picked up cockfighting, dog handling, and playing with mud loaches!

112
00:14:50,768 --> 00:14:53,646
Father, it's not a mud loach.

113
00:14:59,999 --> 00:15:01,359
Little Loach, I'll protect you!

114
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,565
Hide under my arms!

115
00:15:06,039 --> 00:15:08,406
I thought you desired the marriage.

116
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:11,246
What? You think you can cancel it just like that?

117
00:15:11,359 --> 00:15:13,359
That's right! I regret it now.

118
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:15,526
I'm unhappy with it. I'm not marrying Lady Liu.

119
00:15:18,043 --> 00:15:19,535
She wanted to know why you declined the marriage.

120
00:15:19,559 --> 00:15:22,303
It's better for me to be known as an irresponsible man

121
00:15:22,840 --> 00:15:24,806
than putting Lady Liu on the spot.

122
00:15:25,551 --> 00:15:28,709
It's already tough enough for her to yield and bow to mortal customs.

123
00:15:28,804 --> 00:15:32,490
How could I let her be bound by mortal rules when it comes to her marriage?

124
00:15:33,433 --> 00:15:34,880
So, in his heart,

125
00:15:35,310 --> 00:15:39,077
we demons were never meant to be hunted and reviled by all.

126
00:15:40,336 --> 00:15:44,126
We should lead a carefree and unrestrained life instead, huh?

127
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:04,006
It's all because of them! They foiled my great plan!

128
00:16:13,015 --> 00:16:14,941
Don't leave!

129
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,965
I haven't transformed yet!

130
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:20,166
Don't leave! I haven't transformed yet!

131
00:16:23,483 --> 00:16:24,546
Don't leave!

132
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:10,605
Lady Wu Zhen.

133
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:12,446
What are you doing here?

134
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:20,206
Senior, I need your help with something.

135
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:24,405
Please tell me.

136
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:35,645
Help!

137
00:17:36,723 --> 00:17:38,284
Help!

138
00:17:38,391 --> 00:17:40,015
- Lu Yang! - Brother Lu Yang, what's wrong?

139
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:41,405
Brother Lu Yang!

140
00:17:43,359 --> 00:17:45,405
You, don't come near me.

141
00:17:45,720 --> 00:17:47,480
Brother Lu Yang, do you need to go that far?

142
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,845
You mustn't do this.

143
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,726
I'm just showing you my arm.

144
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:55,580
The members of Changxi Palace train half-naked every morning.

145
00:17:55,680 --> 00:17:57,526
I've already seen everything, you know?

146
00:18:02,031 --> 00:18:03,100
How could this be the same?

147
00:18:03,124 --> 00:18:04,393
Men and women should keep their distance.

148
00:18:04,417 --> 00:18:06,285
I'll surely come into contact with you if I treat you.

149
00:18:06,309 --> 00:18:07,395
That's inappropriate.

150
00:18:07,545 --> 00:18:09,607
Moreover, you're already married. Your husband is here.

151
00:18:09,631 --> 00:18:11,758
If I do something like that, that means I lack proper etiquette.

152
00:18:11,782 --> 00:18:13,735
It's understandable to be half-naked during training sessions.

153
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,040
But you're a lady. How could you behave in such a manner?

154
00:18:16,430 --> 00:18:17,493
This is inappropriate.

155
00:18:17,759 --> 00:18:18,879
This is truly inappropriate.

156
00:18:19,160 --> 00:18:21,565
I'm a martial artist. There's no way I'm doing this.

157
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:25,023
You...

158
00:18:26,773 --> 00:18:29,246
Lu Yang, were you actually this eloquent?

159
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:32,495
Brother Lu Yang, are you sure you're the same person?

160
00:18:32,519 --> 00:18:34,759
Brother Lu Yang, are you sure you're in your right mind?

161
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:35,964
Brother Lu Yang.

162
00:18:36,056 --> 00:18:37,384
Don't tell me you were possessed by a demon.

163
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:39,249
Brother Lu Yang, what's wrong? Are you okay?

164
00:18:39,359 --> 00:18:41,966
- Brother Lu Yang. - Brother Lu Yang, are you okay?

165
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:43,417
Brother Lu Yang, are you okay?

166
00:18:43,441 --> 00:18:44,881
Brother Lu Yang, do you feel unwell?

167
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:47,085
What's wrong? Just tell us what's wrong.

168
00:18:47,839 --> 00:18:50,805
Save me.

169
00:18:51,519 --> 00:18:52,582
What's wrong?

170
00:18:56,751 --> 00:18:58,517
What's wrong? Do you feel unwell?

171
00:19:01,839 --> 00:19:05,206
Something strange was growing on my arm.

172
00:19:06,480 --> 00:19:08,645
Therefore, I wanted to get it treated.

173
00:19:09,559 --> 00:19:10,622
Show it to me.

174
00:19:33,608 --> 00:19:35,568
It's my first time seeing you behaving like this.

175
00:19:41,072 --> 00:19:42,992
I suppose you lived all those centuries in vain.

176
00:19:43,392 --> 00:19:45,438
Was age the only thing that piled up?

177
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:48,565
It's fine even if you keep that secret to yourself, you know?

178
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,480
There's no way I can keep it a secret.

179
00:19:55,946 --> 00:19:58,176
There are certain things that will make you lose everything

180
00:19:58,200 --> 00:19:59,671
once you reveal them.

181
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:02,848
If so, wouldn't it be better to enjoy the happiness while it lasted?

182
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:06,600
I understood something after the incident with Kitty.

183
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:10,405
There are certain things we should bring to light as soon as possible.

184
00:20:11,759 --> 00:20:13,446
This way, both parties won't be hurt.

185
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:19,686
If I must say, Mei Si is a fool.

186
00:20:20,137 --> 00:20:22,177
Since he can accept the fact that you're a demon,

187
00:20:22,359 --> 00:20:26,125
I don't know why he cannot accept the fact that you aren't Liu Tai Zhen.

188
00:20:26,680 --> 00:20:28,726
It's because he's not in love with me.

189
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:31,365
He's in love with his past memories.

190
00:20:43,243 --> 00:20:45,529
There's no need for you to bring us together anymore.

191
00:20:46,359 --> 00:20:48,519
Focus on your training and prepare for your ascension.

192
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:53,125
Do you think I'm butting in because I want to?

193
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:56,885
You two were the ones who foiled my transformation, you know?

194
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:02,799
Why don't I capture him again? You two can have another chat.

195
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:04,263
That won't be necessary.

196
00:21:14,608 --> 00:21:16,688
I was just going to capture you. Speak of the devil.

197
00:21:17,079 --> 00:21:18,645
Hurry and converse with Lady Liu.

198
00:21:23,039 --> 00:21:24,102
Come on.

199
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:50,486
Where is Lady Liu?

200
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:56,063
What?

201
00:21:59,119 --> 00:22:00,446
Lady Liu.

202
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:03,246
Where is my Liu Tai Zhen?

203
00:22:14,200 --> 00:22:15,263
I'll take you there.

204
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,085
I took her identity.

205
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,399
Therefore, I couldn't use her name here.

206
00:22:45,559 --> 00:22:47,125
That's why no one tended to her grave.

207
00:22:49,519 --> 00:22:51,239
In the end, I was the one who let her down.

208
00:22:55,519 --> 00:22:57,159
It's been ten years since we parted ways.

209
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,046
You loved a lively atmosphere.

210
00:23:00,920 --> 00:23:04,633
I'm sure it's lonely being alone in the wilderness like this.

211
00:24:01,200 --> 00:24:04,102
I cannot save your spouse.

212
00:24:04,839 --> 00:24:06,479
What she's experiencing isn't an illness.

213
00:24:06,989 --> 00:24:08,396
It's her ordeal.

214
00:24:19,519 --> 00:24:20,582
This won't do!

215
00:24:21,105 --> 00:24:22,791
Brother Xiao Mu, can you lower your voice?

216
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,085
That was pretty terrifying.

217
00:24:25,068 --> 00:24:26,895
We're already making an exception by taking you to the secret archives.

218
00:24:26,919 --> 00:24:29,319
You can't expect us to make exceptions for you all the time.

219
00:24:29,440 --> 00:24:31,966
And, this is too risky.

220
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:33,496
There's no way I'll allow it.

221
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,200
Brother Xiao Mu, I know you mean well.

222
00:24:36,079 --> 00:24:37,839
But now, her demonic ulcers have resurfaced.

223
00:24:38,009 --> 00:24:39,375
She doesn't have much time left.

224
00:24:40,189 --> 00:24:41,696
I have to find out the truth

225
00:24:41,776 --> 00:24:43,696
no matter what tribulation I need to go through.

226
00:24:45,880 --> 00:24:49,446
So, the artifact we found in the secret archives

227
00:24:49,759 --> 00:24:53,565
can take us back 18 years ago and show us what happened, huh?

228
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,848
Indeed.

229
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:56,486
This is too good to be true.

230
00:24:57,799 --> 00:25:00,486
Reversing time in a mortal body

231
00:25:00,759 --> 00:25:03,559
is already a forbidden spell that goes against the way of the heavens.

232
00:25:04,213 --> 00:25:05,380
If something goes wrong,

233
00:25:05,464 --> 00:25:06,815
not only will you not be able to save Wu Zhen,

234
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:10,025
but you'll also die within the space-time turbulence.

235
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:11,239
I know that.

236
00:25:12,128 --> 00:25:13,333
But as a Celestial Master,

237
00:25:14,431 --> 00:25:17,878
I cannot ignore the Sinister Infant Fiend.

238
00:25:19,239 --> 00:25:20,325
As a son,

239
00:25:22,119 --> 00:25:25,766
I cannot allow the murderer of my parents to get away scot-free.

240
00:25:28,200 --> 00:25:29,263
As a...

241
00:25:34,487 --> 00:25:36,533
I can't just stand idly by

242
00:25:37,376 --> 00:25:39,301
as my enemy sucks away the life of my beloved

243
00:25:40,279 --> 00:25:41,565
from within her body.

244
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:47,078
I've made up my mind.

245
00:25:48,119 --> 00:25:49,439
I'll do this by hook or by crook.

246
00:25:50,751 --> 00:25:52,077
Please consent to it.

247
00:26:00,839 --> 00:26:03,422
Tell everyone to get ready.

248
00:26:07,559 --> 00:26:08,622
Yes, Brother Xiao Mu.

249
00:26:20,247 --> 00:26:21,310
Well, this is ugly.

250
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:24,095
Are you sure it was Changxi Palace that sent this to us?

251
00:26:24,119 --> 00:26:26,766
Of course. Just look at how ugly it is.

252
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,526
What did they say, then?

253
00:26:29,559 --> 00:26:31,605
They want me to head to Changxi Palace immediately.

254
00:26:32,775 --> 00:26:35,775
Could it be that they've made some progress regarding Cat Lord's condition?

255
00:26:36,079 --> 00:26:37,365
I hope so.

256
00:26:45,063 --> 00:26:46,429
I have something to ask you.

257
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:49,286
Wu Zi Shu has been wandering on the streets lately.

258
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:51,102
What exactly is he up to?

259
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,605
I have no idea either.

260
00:27:34,279 --> 00:27:35,366
I knew it.

261
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:40,046
This is the place you truly wanted to be 18 years ago.

262
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:45,543
Take a look.

263
00:27:47,042 --> 00:27:48,808
Thank you so much, Shopkeeper Ling Xiao.

264
00:27:48,877 --> 00:27:51,202
You've provided me with timely assistance.

265
00:27:51,359 --> 00:27:52,422
Don't mention it.

266
00:27:56,119 --> 00:27:57,325
Understood.

267
00:27:57,880 --> 00:27:59,165
Here you go.

268
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:03,845
Since the deal is over, I shall be leaving now.

269
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:06,526
Where's my liquor?

270
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:12,766
There's still a customer

271
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:15,142
even at this hour, huh?

272
00:28:15,487 --> 00:28:18,246
He's not an ordinary customer. It's obvious that he's rich.

273
00:28:18,359 --> 00:28:20,359
He has been drinking here for three days straight.

274
00:28:20,400 --> 00:28:23,120
I would've chased him away if it weren't for his wealthy background.

275
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:24,503
Rich, huh?

276
00:28:25,759 --> 00:28:27,006
Which family is he from?

277
00:28:36,008 --> 00:28:38,928
I heard that a rich noble has been drinking here for three days straight.

278
00:28:39,128 --> 00:28:40,853
So, it's Fourth Master Si.

279
00:28:50,279 --> 00:28:51,526
Shopkeeper Ling Xiao.

280
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:54,565
You're being so distant now.

281
00:28:56,039 --> 00:28:57,639
Aren't you going to treat me to a drink?

282
00:29:04,039 --> 00:29:05,486
I don't have a cup.

283
00:29:10,839 --> 00:29:11,902
Forget it.

284
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,046
It seems I'm unwelcome.

285
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:18,845
To think that I covered you up all these years at Yuzhen Parlour.

286
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:21,726
This is truly heartbreaking.

287
00:29:22,759 --> 00:29:24,046
I'm so upset.

288
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:27,686
Shopkeeper Ling Xiao, what are you doing here?

289
00:29:30,812 --> 00:29:31,875
Me?

290
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:33,783
I was merely passing by.

291
00:29:34,279 --> 00:29:35,359
I heard that you were here.

292
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:37,446
I came here to mock you.

293
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:42,240
Don't look at me with that sort of expression.

294
00:29:43,000 --> 00:29:44,165
I'm just concerned about you.

295
00:29:47,599 --> 00:29:48,719
Why aren't you heading home?

296
00:29:51,039 --> 00:29:52,102
Xuan Hui is around.

297
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:56,319
So, Master Snake was waiting for you at home.

298
00:29:57,200 --> 00:29:59,365
To avoid him, you chose to drink here, huh?

299
00:30:02,119 --> 00:30:03,565
What do you mean by avoid him?

300
00:30:04,200 --> 00:30:07,405
I came here merely because of their tasty osmanthus wine.

301
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:09,446
I wasn't avoiding him.

302
00:30:10,400 --> 00:30:11,463
Indeed.

303
00:30:12,039 --> 00:30:15,046
The osmanthus wine they serve here is pretty good.

304
00:30:15,480 --> 00:30:17,280
It's been popular in Chang'an for many years.

305
00:30:17,599 --> 00:30:20,439
Many of the people here love the liquor here with a timeless affection.

306
00:30:21,880 --> 00:30:26,085
Just like your love for Lady Liu.

307
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,885
Shopkeeper Ling Xiao, you may leave now.

308
00:30:36,559 --> 00:30:37,622
Fine.

309
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:39,960
I don't want to ruin your mood either.

310
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:43,966
Fourth Master Si, I only want to ask you this.

311
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:48,325
Everyone knows that you've fancied Lady Liu for over a decade.

312
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,605
It's just that Lady Liu became another person ten years ago.

313
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:56,159
But in these ten years,

314
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:59,255
has your understanding of her truly made no progress at all?

315
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:00,439
Your intentions,

316
00:31:01,799 --> 00:31:02,862
your feelings for her,

317
00:31:03,584 --> 00:31:05,150
have they all stayed where they were

318
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,966
and were stuck at the beginning?

319
00:31:15,751 --> 00:31:18,717
By the way, the liquor here is excellent indeed.

320
00:31:19,255 --> 00:31:22,000
It's because they brew it with the Chongyang osmanthus from the southwest.

321
00:31:22,024 --> 00:31:26,886
It's a shame that a mishap happened while they were transporting them.

322
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:30,006
All of the goods were scattered on the floor.

323
00:31:32,100 --> 00:31:35,105
Therefore, they had no way of providing any osmanthus wine today.

324
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:37,246
And, you were in a hurry to enjoy them.

325
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:39,023
And so,

326
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,645
the wine you're enjoying right now,

327
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,605
it's not osmanthus wine at all.

328
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:54,543
Farewell.

329
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:06,656
If a person cannot figure out the circumstances they're in,

330
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,486
outsiders cannot do anything about it.

331
00:32:09,599 --> 00:32:10,662
Don't you guys agree?

332
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:12,023
Yes, sir.

333
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:14,822
Lord Shu.

334
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,743
What is it?

335
00:32:17,187 --> 00:32:18,354
This is a notification.

336
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:20,605
I'll withdraw these two night guards for now.

337
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:21,889
According to Serpent Lord,

338
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:24,926
since Cat Lord will return soon, we'll stop constraining you.

339
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:26,845
I had no choice but to do this before.

340
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:29,983
Don't blame me for this, okay?

341
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:31,325
Has Serpent Lord returned?

342
00:32:31,577 --> 00:32:33,885
What's wrong? Do you need anything from Her Ladyship?

343
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:35,342
Nope.

344
00:32:37,480 --> 00:32:38,543
Let's go.

345
00:32:57,119 --> 00:32:58,896
Lord Shu, you're finally released from your constraint.

346
00:32:58,920 --> 00:33:00,726
I'm sure you're in a good mood.

347
00:33:01,279 --> 00:33:02,342
Let's talk inside.

348
00:33:19,279 --> 00:33:21,845
Lord Shu, what's your plan?

349
00:33:25,480 --> 00:33:29,845
Lord Shu, you haven't obtained the key to the door yet.

350
00:33:31,480 --> 00:33:33,246
Don't be so smug.

351
00:33:36,039 --> 00:33:37,845
How did you find out?

352
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:09,245
Did you tail me?

353
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:14,645
Lord Shu, you shouldn't put it that way.

354
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:18,871
A few days ago, I saw you searching for something in the Demon City.

355
00:34:19,000 --> 00:34:20,645
You were so absorbed in your search.

356
00:34:20,760 --> 00:34:23,685
I wasn't the only demon who noticed what you were doing.

357
00:34:24,280 --> 00:34:26,806
Speaking of which, you should thank me for it.

358
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:30,725
You wouldn't be able to locate that place smoothly

359
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,966
had I not lured the others away one by one.

360
00:34:36,519 --> 00:34:40,765
Elder Gray, seems like I have to thank you.

361
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,725
What do you want?

362
00:34:50,119 --> 00:34:53,886
Lord Shu, I merely want to join hands

363
00:34:54,159 --> 00:34:55,926
and examine the place with you.

364
00:34:57,014 --> 00:35:00,725
You do live up to your name as an elder in Chang'an.

365
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:04,205
You're able to keep your pride in check when it matters the most.

366
00:35:04,479 --> 00:35:06,125
What can I do about it?

367
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:09,605
I have no choice. You're Sinister Lord Infant's trusted aide.

368
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:11,773
If I wish to examine the place,

369
00:35:11,920 --> 00:35:16,199
I have to depend on your strength.

370
00:35:16,283 --> 00:35:17,346
Isn't that so?

371
00:35:19,369 --> 00:35:21,369
That used to be the grounds of the Demon City.

372
00:35:21,440 --> 00:35:25,886
Only Cat Lord and Serpent Lord can enter and exit the place at will.

373
00:35:26,159 --> 00:35:29,725
Right now, only Serpent Lord is around.

374
00:35:30,264 --> 00:35:32,463
If we wish to check that place out,

375
00:35:32,559 --> 00:35:35,326
we have no choice but to start with Serpent Lord.

376
00:35:36,678 --> 00:35:39,100
Lord Shu, it seems

377
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:42,245
you lack a helper.

378
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:47,526
Elder Gray, you're truly slick with your words.

379
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:51,806
I assume you've come up with a way for me to retrieve the key as well.

380
00:35:52,402 --> 00:35:53,465
Lord Shu.

381
00:35:54,696 --> 00:35:57,935
You want to discover the secret of Sinister Lord Infant

382
00:35:58,023 --> 00:36:00,790
just so you can save Cat Lord, right?

383
00:36:01,567 --> 00:36:03,814
We can join hands for that.

384
00:36:04,423 --> 00:36:08,269
Once we discover his secret,

385
00:36:10,639 --> 00:36:12,006
we shall stay out of

386
00:36:13,519 --> 00:36:14,806
each other's way.

387
00:36:20,440 --> 00:36:21,503
Deal.

388
00:36:58,440 --> 00:36:59,645
(18 years.)

389
00:37:00,639 --> 00:37:02,926
(The core has been inside her for 18 years.)

390
00:37:03,765 --> 00:37:05,325
(Now, strange symptoms are showing up.)

391
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:07,125
(I'm afraid the seal won't last long.)

392
00:37:26,622 --> 00:37:27,944
(I must find out what happened)

393
00:37:28,024 --> 00:37:30,064
(when the previous Cat Lord first sealed him away.)

394
00:37:30,312 --> 00:37:33,725
(That's my only way to ensure her safety.)

395
00:38:39,236 --> 00:38:40,362
Thank you, everyone.

396
00:38:45,047 --> 00:38:46,814
Zhu Yu, remember this.

397
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:48,552
You're defying the way of the heavens by doing this.

398
00:38:48,576 --> 00:38:51,470
Once you return to the past, do not try to change any of the past events

399
00:38:51,639 --> 00:38:52,959
or determine one's life or death.

400
00:38:57,440 --> 00:38:58,503
I understand.

401
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:00,703
Let's begin.

402
00:39:31,288 --> 00:39:33,613
The past events were destined to happen.

403
00:39:33,912 --> 00:39:35,078
If you try anything foolish,

404
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:38,121
not only will you be trapped within the past and the present forever,

405
00:39:38,378 --> 00:39:41,503
but unknown changes will also happen to the present.
