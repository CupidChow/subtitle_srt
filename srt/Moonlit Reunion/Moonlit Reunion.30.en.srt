00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:30,960
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,044 --> 00:01:33,992
(Episode 30)

3
00:01:45,766 --> 00:01:47,207
We're finally out.

4
00:01:47,357 --> 00:01:50,642
Yeah. The night felt like a dream.

5
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:53,326
Luckily, we woke up,

6
00:01:53,879 --> 00:01:56,446
and Chang'an remains the same.

7
00:01:58,535 --> 00:01:59,598
Let's go.

8
00:02:46,614 --> 00:02:47,677
Shu.

9
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:49,927
Zhen, you're awake.

10
00:02:55,509 --> 00:03:00,795
Did you know that Mei Zhu Yu was related to Changxi Palace long ago?

11
00:03:06,353 --> 00:03:07,434
Yes, I did.

12
00:03:07,521 --> 00:03:09,486
If so, why didn't you tell me before?

13
00:03:09,879 --> 00:03:11,079
It's because of what you said.

14
00:03:11,815 --> 00:03:15,886
I'll do it myself. I'll go through both fortune and hardship myself.

15
00:03:17,919 --> 00:03:20,359
You said you'd go through both fortune and hardship yourself.

16
00:03:25,479 --> 00:03:26,542
I know this all too well.

17
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,676
You would never give up on Mei Zhu Yu

18
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:32,365
if you didn't witness the scene yourself.

19
00:03:33,130 --> 00:03:36,216
But Zhen, I truly never expected it

20
00:03:36,951 --> 00:03:38,518
to end up like this.

21
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:44,408
I never expected the core to be contained within your body.

22
00:03:47,639 --> 00:03:48,702
Shu.

23
00:03:52,199 --> 00:03:54,166
Why do I feel like you're a different person now?

24
00:04:26,016 --> 00:04:27,079
You didn't sleep, huh?

25
00:04:56,421 --> 00:04:59,044
Did you maintain that posture the entire night?

26
00:05:07,519 --> 00:05:09,286
How is Lady Liu doing now?

27
00:05:10,686 --> 00:05:12,646
I inquired about her from Ling Xiao this morning.

28
00:05:12,959 --> 00:05:15,375
This time, the Demon City was on the brink of a great calamity.

29
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:17,485
Both Cat Lord and Serpent Lord were wounded.

30
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,671
Fortunately, it was nothing too serious. They'll survive.

31
00:05:19,695 --> 00:05:20,758
Don't worry about it.

32
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:27,846
A great calamity? They were wounded as well? How could I not worry?

33
00:05:29,679 --> 00:05:32,239
I also told you that it was nothing too serious.

34
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:33,412
It was nothing too serious!

35
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,606
Can you listen to the whole statement?

36
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,554
But you mentioned a great calamity. I'm sure it's not that simple.

37
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:42,726
If I find out who caused them such trouble,

38
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:44,245
I'll surely beat him up.

39
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:48,110
Not only do you know him, but he's also one of your acquaintances.

40
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:49,745
Who is it?

41
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,846
It's your handsome cousin.

42
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:00,005
Do you mean Little Fish?

43
00:06:08,279 --> 00:06:11,206
They didn't return the entire night.

44
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:17,245
Maybe Lady Wu Zhen took your young master out on a sudden trip.

45
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:22,743
In the past, Young Master would definitely notify me

46
00:06:22,823 --> 00:06:24,866
when he was going to spend the night out.

47
00:06:26,079 --> 00:06:29,846
Now, he no longer cares about me.

48
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:33,325
Even if he does intend to care about someone,

49
00:06:33,519 --> 00:06:35,478
right now, it's no longer you.

50
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:36,702
I...

51
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,005
It's a given that Young Master should care about Lady Wu Zhen.

52
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:44,740
But I am still the second most important figure in the family after all.

53
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,342
Wait.

54
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:48,840
Am I the third most important figure?

55
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:52,663
Or the fourth?

56
00:06:57,759 --> 00:06:59,245
Don't tell me I'm the fifth.

57
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:04,479
If they intended to celebrate his birthday outside,

58
00:07:04,508 --> 00:07:06,988
Lady Wu Zhen wouldn't need to prepare all of these here.

59
00:07:07,159 --> 00:07:08,222
What has she prepared?

60
00:07:09,959 --> 00:07:11,079
- Young Master? - Mr. Mei.

61
00:07:11,689 --> 00:07:15,005
Mr. Mei, didn't Lady Wu Zhen return with you?

62
00:07:38,292 --> 00:07:39,972
Young Master, the dishes are already cold.

63
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:48,599
I'm sure Her Highness has returned.

64
00:08:07,519 --> 00:08:08,582
Little Fish.

65
00:08:23,378 --> 00:08:25,579
Little Fish, that was a huge deal.

66
00:08:25,672 --> 00:08:27,358
How could you hide it from me?

67
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:32,486
So, in the end, all of you have secrets, except for me.

68
00:08:33,013 --> 00:08:35,023
Fourth Brother, you knew about the Demon City,

69
00:08:35,103 --> 00:08:36,699
yet you didn't tell me about it either.

70
00:08:36,864 --> 00:08:39,509
I... I'm your elder cousin after all.

71
00:08:39,768 --> 00:08:41,653
It's normal for me to be a step ahead of you.

72
00:08:42,879 --> 00:08:46,845
And, this matter is between you and Miss Zhen.

73
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:48,840
How was I supposed to break the news?

74
00:08:51,919 --> 00:08:53,965
Did you really enter the Demon City?

75
00:08:56,759 --> 00:08:58,046
Why did you go there?

76
00:08:59,559 --> 00:09:02,359
I thought you had an informant. Why are you still asking me questions?

77
00:09:04,837 --> 00:09:07,517
My informant isn't good at his job. He only told me the gist of it.

78
00:09:07,551 --> 00:09:08,614
What does that mean?

79
00:09:11,039 --> 00:09:13,135
He's Shopkeeper Ling Xiao, who's working under Lady Liu.

80
00:09:13,159 --> 00:09:14,799
He said you intruded upon the Demon City.

81
00:09:14,972 --> 00:09:17,035
He even said that you were an ingrate.

82
00:09:18,759 --> 00:09:20,166
Why exactly are you here?

83
00:09:22,229 --> 00:09:25,389
Little Fish, you entered the Demon City once, right?

84
00:09:25,559 --> 00:09:26,924
Can you enter it again?

85
00:09:31,159 --> 00:09:32,222
But why?

86
00:09:32,519 --> 00:09:35,965
I'm worried about Lady Liu.

87
00:10:10,368 --> 00:10:12,048
I've transferred some of my powers to you.

88
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,438
I assume it'll relieve your suffering temporarily.

89
00:10:18,039 --> 00:10:19,102
Thank you.

90
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,445
I should thank you instead.

91
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,746
You have a mortal body. It's already difficult enough being a demi-demon.

92
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,560
To think that you used your body to seal the core away for 18 years.

93
00:10:32,559 --> 00:10:33,886
Without this encounter,

94
00:10:35,302 --> 00:10:40,828
I would never know about the secret within my body.

95
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:43,605
The previous Cat Lord said

96
00:10:44,879 --> 00:10:46,805
that there was no free lunch in the world.

97
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:49,845
Everything has a price.

98
00:10:50,904 --> 00:10:53,824
I thought that the price I had to pay was to exact the Cat Lord's duties.

99
00:10:54,599 --> 00:10:55,896
I never expected this

100
00:10:58,271 --> 00:10:59,602
to be the price instead.

101
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,306
Little Fish, when do you plan to enter the Demon City with me?

102
00:11:32,985 --> 00:11:34,840
Fourth Brother, I thought you were very resourceful.

103
00:11:34,864 --> 00:11:36,296
Why didn't you look for someone else?

104
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:39,046
For example, you can find Ling Xiao or Hu Zhu.

105
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:41,319
Did you think I never approached them?

106
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:44,625
Did you think I would need to be here had they agreed to my proposal?

107
00:11:45,706 --> 00:11:48,570
However, after making some inquiries,

108
00:11:48,759 --> 00:11:50,246
I finally understood something.

109
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:51,925
None of them understood me.

110
00:11:53,799 --> 00:11:58,886
Little Fish, we're the only ones in the same boat here.

111
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:04,046
Fourth Brother, I have no way to take you to the Demon City.

112
00:12:05,767 --> 00:12:08,492
That's fine. I have plenty of patience.

113
00:12:09,021 --> 00:12:10,868
Let's see who gives up first.

114
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,621
Why are you still here?

115
00:12:32,586 --> 00:12:34,393
I'm here to escort Zhen home.

116
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:36,480
Cat Lord will be staying with me tonight.

117
00:12:38,559 --> 00:12:39,622
Why is that?

118
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,800
You knew well enough to avert your gaze when my robes were in disarray.

119
00:12:42,888 --> 00:12:45,934
I'm sure you know why Cat Lord is staying with me tonight.

120
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:50,445
I'll keep her company for the next few days.

121
00:12:50,759 --> 00:12:52,166
Go and tend to your duties.

122
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,503
Oh no.

123
00:13:44,799 --> 00:13:46,406
What kind of liquor did I take?

124
00:13:46,869 --> 00:13:48,356
Isn't the kick too strong?

125
00:14:13,536 --> 00:14:14,576
Zhu Yu?

126
00:14:14,695 --> 00:14:16,249
Luckily, I came just in time to see you guys off.

127
00:14:16,273 --> 00:14:17,599
You reek of alcohol.

128
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,831
You didn't need to see us off if you were busy with something.

129
00:14:20,855 --> 00:14:22,327
It's not like we're not seeing each other again.

130
00:14:22,351 --> 00:14:23,998
Come back and visit us when you're free.

131
00:14:24,246 --> 00:14:25,309
Of course.

132
00:14:29,080 --> 00:14:31,440
I used the Changxi Truncheon before as it was an emergency.

133
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:34,401
But ultimately, I'm no longer a member of Changxi Palace.

134
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:36,925
It's illogical for me to keep it with me.

135
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,120
And now, the position of Sect Leader is vacant.

136
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:42,263
I think it's most appropriate to leave it to Brother Xiao Mu.

137
00:14:43,884 --> 00:14:46,907
Since Master has left it to you, it's yours.

138
00:14:48,096 --> 00:14:50,216
Previously, Chang Ming practiced the dark arts.

139
00:14:50,296 --> 00:14:52,576
That's why the Changxi Truncheon refused to submit to him.

140
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:54,416
Brother Xiao Mu has clear intentions and a pure mind.

141
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,400
The Changxi Truncheon will acknowledge its owner.

142
00:14:56,919 --> 00:14:59,200
Moreover, Brother Xiao Mu, I haven't managed to thank you

143
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,886
for what you did during the White Night Array.

144
00:15:03,445 --> 00:15:06,412
What has Brother Xiao Mu got to do with the White Night Array?

145
00:15:14,831 --> 00:15:16,576
The punishment mustn't occur for the third time!

146
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,080
Zhu Yu won't be able to withstand it!

147
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,240
Yeah! Twice is already as harsh as it should be!

148
00:15:20,296 --> 00:15:21,856
How could it happen for the third time?

149
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:30,001
Back then, although I saw that everyone had headed there,

150
00:15:30,222 --> 00:15:32,268
I didn't know about his identity.

151
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:35,085
I don't know how much he has tampered with it.

152
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:37,800
That's why I wasn't able to stop him in time.

153
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:41,471
A great calamity would've occurred were it not

154
00:15:41,551 --> 00:15:44,006
for your affinity with the Changxi Truncheon.

155
00:15:45,559 --> 00:15:47,549
After that, Brother Xiao Mu chased me out of the sect.

156
00:15:47,573 --> 00:15:50,458
He may have looked strict, but in reality, he was escorting me.

157
00:15:50,953 --> 00:15:52,399
He even gave me his fine steed.

158
00:15:53,143 --> 00:15:54,223
Thank you, Brother Xiao Mu.

159
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:57,904
It's not just me. You should thank it too.

160
00:15:58,744 --> 00:16:00,550
Master left the Changxi Truncheon for you.

161
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,320
Naturally, it'll protect you as well.

162
00:16:02,799 --> 00:16:06,046
We can rest at ease if you take it with you.

163
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:09,015
- But Changxi Palace must... - Didn't Master say this before?

164
00:16:09,039 --> 00:16:12,685
The duty of a Celestial Master shouldn't be bound by a single truncheon.

165
00:16:13,128 --> 00:16:15,848
Although the Demon City of Chang'an isn't what Chang Ming described,

166
00:16:16,101 --> 00:16:17,620
it's still a realm different from ours.

167
00:16:17,644 --> 00:16:18,808
You're living in Chang'an,

168
00:16:18,888 --> 00:16:21,088
and you hold a position in the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

169
00:16:21,159 --> 00:16:23,605
You might encounter demons again.

170
00:16:24,583 --> 00:16:27,710
May you exact your duty as a Celestial Master with the Changxi Truncheon.

171
00:16:29,279 --> 00:16:30,342
Yes, Brother Xiao Mu.

172
00:16:32,993 --> 00:16:35,958
But now that we're leaving, I'm reluctant to part with him.

173
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:40,183
Forget it.

174
00:16:40,919 --> 00:16:43,205
Master once said that everything has its own just causes.

175
00:16:43,504 --> 00:16:46,951
We might meet again if our destinies may.

176
00:16:47,341 --> 00:16:49,866
Yeah. Everything has its own just causes.

177
00:17:04,200 --> 00:17:05,286
Zhu Yu, what's the matter?

178
00:17:06,151 --> 00:17:07,203
It's...

179
00:17:07,359 --> 00:17:08,422
It's nothing.

180
00:17:48,416 --> 00:17:50,182
Lady Hu Zhu? What are you doing here?

181
00:17:51,079 --> 00:17:53,046
I've been waiting for you all since this morning.

182
00:17:53,559 --> 00:17:55,279
You guys did take your own sweet time, huh?

183
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:58,046
Lady Hu Zhu, what are you doing here?

184
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:00,080
My mistress instructed me to see you guys off.

185
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:01,880
There's no need to be this courteous.

186
00:18:02,583 --> 00:18:05,126
She said the Demon City could only rest at ease

187
00:18:05,328 --> 00:18:06,968
only after you guys left Chang'an safely.

188
00:18:10,814 --> 00:18:12,490
Since my mistress instructed me to relay this message,

189
00:18:12,514 --> 00:18:14,057
you guys don't need to worry.

190
00:18:14,567 --> 00:18:16,568
Since she has the core in her body,

191
00:18:16,671 --> 00:18:19,316
she won't let it resurface and wreak havoc in the world again

192
00:18:19,681 --> 00:18:21,567
at all costs.

193
00:18:22,279 --> 00:18:25,342
With mountains high and roads long, please take care.

194
00:18:27,079 --> 00:18:28,142
Farewell.

195
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:34,463
Thanks for the farewell.

196
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:49,125
Seniors, please wait a while.

197
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:05,246
Why are you back?

198
00:19:14,279 --> 00:19:17,684
Isn't this your favorite Hu flatbread from the east city side?

199
00:19:18,700 --> 00:19:19,903
Their stall is always full of customers.

200
00:19:19,927 --> 00:19:22,332
I queued for a long time this early. That's why we're late.

201
00:19:23,816 --> 00:19:24,941
What are you doing?

202
00:19:25,141 --> 00:19:26,549
Isn't this your ration?

203
00:19:27,368 --> 00:19:29,813
I wanted to use them as my ration initially.

204
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,885
But you came here early in the morning. I'm sure you haven't had breakfast.

205
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,845
You should at least have something on your way back.

206
00:19:51,079 --> 00:19:52,165
It's getting late.

207
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,023
Yeah.

208
00:19:57,720 --> 00:20:01,102
So, I suppose this is farewell.

209
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,206
Shuang Jiang, don't tell me you have other intentions in mind.

210
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,943
What intention?

211
00:20:27,839 --> 00:20:29,319
Do you no longer desire to be a hero?

212
00:20:31,319 --> 00:20:32,645
My only desire is to be a hero.

213
00:20:33,400 --> 00:20:34,463
Let's go.

214
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:57,526
Darned demon, time to die!

215
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:01,703
What are you doing?

216
00:21:03,119 --> 00:21:04,182
I'm just doing a test.

217
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,966
Lady Hu Zhu, this place is so decrepit.

218
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:16,783
Lady Hu Zhu, watch out!

219
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:30,023
Thank you.

220
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:35,845
Lady Hu Zhu, are you okay?

221
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:40,686
You helped me before. I have to repay the favor.

222
00:21:41,079 --> 00:21:43,165
However, I'm a cultivator.

223
00:21:43,359 --> 00:21:44,966
Although I'm not good by any means,

224
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:47,885
my only intention is to attain the Way.

225
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,469
But now, for your sake,

226
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:51,731
- I... - Wait!

227
00:21:51,812 --> 00:21:53,195
Judging from your expression,

228
00:21:53,275 --> 00:21:55,195
don't tell me you intend to give yourself to me.

229
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:57,966
If so, you don't need to repay the favor.

230
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:01,125
You can focus on cultivating while I'll focus on earning money.

231
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,206
We shall do our own things.

232
00:22:05,079 --> 00:22:08,526
I never expected you to treat me this well merely after two encounters.

233
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:13,405
I've made up my mind. From now on, you're my bosom friend.

234
00:22:13,750 --> 00:22:15,430
In the future, if you need anything,

235
00:22:15,599 --> 00:22:17,526
just tell me.

236
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:19,120
There's no need to be this courteous.

237
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:25,668
(Strike it big)

238
00:22:25,880 --> 00:22:28,565
Master Shuang Jiang, do you have any wishes?

239
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:30,960
My wish is to get rid of all demons and evil!

240
00:22:40,839 --> 00:22:43,165
I left the city in a hurry. I didn't prepare much.

241
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:44,960
I only have this Hu flatbread with me.

242
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:48,023
Here you go.

243
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:18,360
Fourth Brother, what are you doing?

244
00:23:21,319 --> 00:23:23,365
Naturally, I'm praying for Lady Liu's safety.

245
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:31,046
Why are you praying to me for that?

246
00:23:33,413 --> 00:23:36,459
You're a demon slayer. I hope that you won't capture her.

247
00:23:38,043 --> 00:23:41,129
Little Fish, if you drive me to death,

248
00:23:41,255 --> 00:23:43,942
I'll complain about you to your parents in the afterlife.

249
00:23:53,480 --> 00:23:54,543
No need for that.

250
00:23:58,480 --> 00:23:59,680
You can complain to them here.

251
00:24:00,039 --> 00:24:01,102
It's the same.

252
00:24:10,160 --> 00:24:11,840
For the past few days, I've been thinking.

253
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:14,686
Was I wrong from the start?

254
00:24:16,039 --> 00:24:17,645
I should've heeded your advice.

255
00:24:19,599 --> 00:24:23,605
There are some experiences in life that we don't need to experience.

256
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:27,246
But I've said this as well.

257
00:24:28,093 --> 00:24:31,299
I know how pleasing it is to have a romantic relationship.

258
00:24:32,472 --> 00:24:35,686
Follow what the heart longs for.

259
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:39,486
And if the paths divide, let each set forth on their own.

260
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,526
There's no wrong in that.

261
00:24:47,759 --> 00:24:48,822
Kitty.

262
00:24:52,359 --> 00:24:55,046
I just hope that you won't regret

263
00:24:56,559 --> 00:24:57,845
the choices you've made.

264
00:25:01,880 --> 00:25:03,920
Why don't we enter the Demon City together?

265
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:06,320
You can see Miss Zhen while I can see Lady Liu.

266
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:07,463
What do we call that?

267
00:25:07,716 --> 00:25:08,956
We call it a win-win situation.

268
00:25:09,184 --> 00:25:12,766
Fourth Brother, you didn't go after Lady Liu for the past few days.

269
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:14,966
I thought you'd already gotten over her.

270
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,645
How could I be the same as you?

271
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:19,125
I was just afraid that I might bother her.

272
00:25:19,839 --> 00:25:23,405
It's good enough for me to observe her and wait on her in secret.

273
00:25:24,274 --> 00:25:25,337
In the end?

274
00:25:25,695 --> 00:25:27,096
Thanks to what you've done,

275
00:25:27,240 --> 00:25:30,446
I can't see or wait on her anymore.

276
00:25:34,920 --> 00:25:36,486
What does this gift box contain?

277
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,520
It's a birthday from my father-in-law.

278
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:43,885
It's from Uncle Wu, huh?

279
00:25:50,079 --> 00:25:51,565
It looks pretty nice.

280
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:04,885
These are figures of you and Miss Zhen, huh?

281
00:26:08,039 --> 00:26:10,046
They don't resemble you two, though.

282
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:13,805
You aren't that adorable.

283
00:26:15,319 --> 00:26:17,046
Miss Zhen isn't that gentle either.

284
00:26:17,920 --> 00:26:19,686
They do resemble me and Lady Liu.

285
00:26:22,039 --> 00:26:24,325
I do miss Lady Liu now.

286
00:27:05,559 --> 00:27:06,622
What are you doing here,

287
00:27:07,720 --> 00:27:08,783
Mr. Mei?

288
00:27:20,079 --> 00:27:21,165
Miss Zhen?

289
00:27:21,683 --> 00:27:23,546
- Little Serpent? - Miss Zhen!

290
00:27:37,880 --> 00:27:38,943
Are you Si?

291
00:27:43,720 --> 00:27:45,966
So, you are Lady Liu.

292
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:52,783
So,

293
00:27:53,640 --> 00:27:58,966
Mei Si swapped my body with his all because he touched this, huh?

294
00:28:01,599 --> 00:28:04,006
Duke Wu gave us this gift.

295
00:28:05,079 --> 00:28:07,605
I didn't know that this would happen.

296
00:28:16,079 --> 00:28:19,645
Miss Zhen, this is truly unexpected.

297
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,605
I merely made a wish to the moon. I didn't expect it to come true.

298
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:26,605
Now, I'm in the Demon City.

299
00:28:27,519 --> 00:28:29,565
And, I'm able to see Lady Liu as well.

300
00:28:30,079 --> 00:28:32,845
But this isn't what I intended at all.

301
00:28:36,720 --> 00:28:37,926
Stop crying.

302
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:40,526
Stop crying.

303
00:28:43,098 --> 00:28:45,743
I don't think this happened because of your wish.

304
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:48,165
What have you done before this?

305
00:28:48,359 --> 00:28:49,605
I haven't done anything.

306
00:28:51,519 --> 00:28:52,799
There were two wooden figurines.

307
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:54,759
I just played with them.

308
00:28:54,839 --> 00:28:56,439
- After that, I... - Wooden figurines?

309
00:28:57,440 --> 00:28:59,080
Is there more to them than meets the eye?

310
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,766
Can we swap back our bodies, then?

311
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:07,376
I'm not sure. We have to examine the figurines first.

312
00:29:08,782 --> 00:29:10,108
Let's go, then. Let's head to your residence.

313
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:12,035
- My residence? - Yeah.

314
00:29:12,116 --> 00:29:14,045
The wooden figurines were gifts from your unreliable father.

315
00:29:14,069 --> 00:29:16,029
They're in the Mei Residence right now. Let's go.

316
00:29:35,599 --> 00:29:36,662
Greetings, my lords.

317
00:29:43,240 --> 00:29:45,565
Act well. Don't let anyone find out.

318
00:29:46,039 --> 00:29:47,102
Okay.

319
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:50,966
Hey. How should I act?

320
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:52,479
Just keep your wits about you.

321
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:53,622
Cat Lord.

322
00:29:54,119 --> 00:29:55,182
Serpent Lord.

323
00:29:57,799 --> 00:29:59,080
What's wrong with Serpent Lord?

324
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:00,223
She's sick.

325
00:30:00,640 --> 00:30:01,703
She's sick.

326
00:30:03,160 --> 00:30:04,223
Is she sick?

327
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:09,645
Lady Liu, how is she doing?

328
00:30:11,319 --> 00:30:12,382
She's fine for now.

329
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:14,926
Mr. Mei, you don't need to worry.

330
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,263
Lady Liu!

331
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:23,263
Lady Liu!

332
00:30:25,119 --> 00:30:26,182
Lady Liu!

333
00:30:27,640 --> 00:30:28,703
Lady Liu!

334
00:30:29,319 --> 00:30:32,885
Mei Si, can you stop doing that expression with my face?

335
00:30:41,480 --> 00:30:42,543
Come with me.

336
00:30:44,039 --> 00:30:45,102
What are you up to?

337
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:47,365
We'll swap our bodies back.

338
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:49,983
All right!

339
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:58,125
Lady Liu, these are the wooden figurines.

340
00:31:05,359 --> 00:31:08,400
Can we swap our bodies back now?

341
00:31:08,480 --> 00:31:09,605
How should we do it?

342
00:31:11,240 --> 00:31:12,303
You're so noisy.

343
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:04,102
Mei Zhu Yu.

344
00:32:08,559 --> 00:32:09,622
You're back.

345
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:11,966
Are you hungry? Let's have some food.

346
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:15,080
- We... - There's Apricot Gold as well.

347
00:32:16,119 --> 00:32:18,286
You prepared it for my birthday dinner.

348
00:32:18,960 --> 00:32:20,246
There's some of it left.

349
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,805
You don't need to do this.

350
00:32:24,759 --> 00:32:26,279
Dear, you came to me in your true form

351
00:32:27,119 --> 00:32:28,726
without fear of being discovered.

352
00:32:29,559 --> 00:32:31,286
I know what you're going to say.

353
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,593
Dear, I'm sorry.

354
00:32:39,042 --> 00:32:42,647
I've let you down that night.

355
00:32:48,359 --> 00:32:49,439
The moonlight is exquisite.

356
00:32:50,554 --> 00:32:52,634
I'm sure you like to drink under the fine moonlight.

357
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:57,246
You loved to drink here when you first came to find me.

358
00:32:59,229 --> 00:33:02,836
At that time, I was troubled by your persistent entanglement.

359
00:33:03,160 --> 00:33:06,403
But now, times have changed. I'm the one pestering you now.

360
00:33:06,570 --> 00:33:07,633
Come.

361
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:11,405
Let's get a divorce.

362
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,662
I said,

363
00:33:21,043 --> 00:33:22,370
let's get a divorce.

364
00:33:38,064 --> 00:33:39,316
Perhaps you don't mind letting other people find out

365
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:42,030
about your identity as a member of Changxi Palace.

366
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,779
But I'm different.

367
00:33:45,533 --> 00:33:49,405
Mr. Mei, please keep my identity a secret

368
00:33:49,718 --> 00:33:51,158
on account of our past relationship.

369
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,006
Chaos will surely ensue if the people of Chang'an

370
00:33:56,039 --> 00:33:57,645
find out about the Demon City.

371
00:34:05,880 --> 00:34:10,165
I'm no longer a member of Changxi Palace ever since my return from Quzhou.

372
00:34:11,760 --> 00:34:13,846
You and I weren't bound by the palace rules

373
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,006
or by our positions.

374
00:34:23,719 --> 00:34:25,285
No matter if you are or not,

375
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:30,846
from now on, it's none of my concern.

376
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:36,135
The misunderstanding we had 18 years ago has been resolved.

377
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:38,446
The Demon City and Changxi Palace are no longer at war.

378
00:34:38,745 --> 00:34:40,455
Why can we not return to the way things once were?

379
00:34:40,479 --> 00:34:42,239
It's because I cannot forget about the past.

380
00:34:48,800 --> 00:34:51,046
You've already made up your mind

381
00:34:51,960 --> 00:34:53,760
ever since you decided to dispel the barrier.

382
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,681
The time when we once crossed swords

383
00:34:57,761 --> 00:35:00,165
is something I cannot erase from memory.

384
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:04,806
Even if we were to make peace,

385
00:35:06,719 --> 00:35:10,285
we belong to two different worlds.

386
00:35:14,719 --> 00:35:16,565
Are you sure you know what choice I've made?

387
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:19,559
- I've always been... - Mei Zhu Yu.

388
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:26,085
You should know that we're done.

389
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:35,765
You may blame me for it.

390
00:35:43,159 --> 00:35:44,366
But please don't leave me.

391
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,526
I said this before. I will never let go of you.

392
00:35:55,920 --> 00:35:59,846
Now, whenever I see you, I'm only reminded of that night.

393
00:36:01,245 --> 00:36:05,690
You'll only be reminded of the fact that you survived

394
00:36:06,639 --> 00:36:08,759
only because of me, the person who slew your parents.

395
00:36:11,039 --> 00:36:12,645
If you don't kill me,

396
00:36:14,716 --> 00:36:19,682
you'll spend your days with your parents' killer.

397
00:36:21,599 --> 00:36:23,639
You have to live with me for the rest of your life.

398
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:28,125
If, one day, you no longer love me, and wish to seek revenge,

399
00:36:29,960 --> 00:36:34,326
I'll pay for it with my life.

400
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:38,926
Mr. Mei.

401
00:36:41,800 --> 00:36:43,685
Our relationship is unpredictable.

402
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:47,279
Why not spare each other sooner, and be done with it?

403
00:36:50,559 --> 00:36:52,205
You're an open-minded person usually.

404
00:36:53,199 --> 00:36:55,406
Why haven't you woken up from your obsession?

405
00:36:59,519 --> 00:37:01,046
Are you sure I'm obsessed?

406
00:37:03,039 --> 00:37:04,759
Or is it you who speaks against your heart?

407
00:37:11,400 --> 00:37:13,640
Commissioner Mei, you have a bright future ahead of you.

408
00:37:14,639 --> 00:37:18,125
There is no shortage of noble ladies who fancy you.

409
00:37:19,880 --> 00:37:23,056
In the days to come, you may choose a lady who shares your heart

410
00:37:23,136 --> 00:37:25,285
and raise children together with her.

411
00:37:26,719 --> 00:37:28,406
That's a good thing.

412
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:31,142
What about you?

413
00:37:33,360 --> 00:37:34,765
As a demon,

414
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:38,926
naturally, I can't spend my time with a Celestial Master like you.

415
00:37:39,840 --> 00:37:45,806
I'll surely lead a carefree life and travel across the Mortal Realm.

416
00:37:49,760 --> 00:37:50,966
Say that again.

417
00:37:57,280 --> 00:38:00,463
I'll surely lead a carefree life and travel across...

418
00:38:13,001 --> 00:38:14,848
Demons have a long lifespan.

419
00:38:15,039 --> 00:38:17,215
What's the point even if you insist on being together with me now?

420
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,245
No one will remember that after 100 years.

421
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:22,046
You and I were a mistake from the start.

422
00:38:22,360 --> 00:38:27,158
Mortals and demons can never be together.

423
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:34,125
Dear, on account of our ties,

424
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:39,725
please let me go.

425
00:39:27,600 --> 00:39:32,659
(Wife, Wu Zhen)

426
00:39:35,453 --> 00:39:41,440
(Wife, Wu Zhen)
