00:01:27,296 --> 00:01:30,895
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,054 --> 00:01:33,960
(Episode 11)

3
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:53,160
He saved me.

4
00:02:54,726 --> 00:02:56,119
I can't let him become a cripple.

5
00:02:56,273 --> 00:02:58,266
You just got rid of the Undecaying bone yesterday

6
00:02:58,439 --> 00:03:00,600
and you still spent energy to treat him today.

7
00:03:00,792 --> 00:03:02,871
- You should care about your health.   - It's fine.

8
00:03:04,472 --> 00:03:05,680
I'm great.

9
00:04:00,366 --> 00:04:01,856
Summon the imperial physician immediately.

10
00:04:39,664 --> 00:04:41,743
Commissioner Mei, you are blessed.

11
00:04:41,879 --> 00:04:44,512
You actually recovered quickly from your injury.

12
00:04:44,824 --> 00:04:47,057
However, you fell from a high place after all.

13
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,673
If time allows, you should recuperate for some time

14
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:51,872
just to be safe.

15
00:04:52,703 --> 00:04:54,320
I'll go and write a prescription

16
00:04:54,495 --> 00:04:55,720
that suits your recovery.

17
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,832
I'm sure you will recover very soon.

18
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:00,975
Thank you.

19
00:05:02,959 --> 00:05:04,272
Report this to the palace.

20
00:05:49,839 --> 00:05:51,720
Lady Wu Zhen was unhurt

21
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:54,072
thanks to your protection, Mr. Mei.

22
00:05:55,487 --> 00:05:56,533
No need to thank me.

23
00:05:56,839 --> 00:05:58,512
When you were hurt last night,

24
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:00,072
not only the Empress and Consort Mei,

25
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,353
but Lady Wu Zhen was worried about you as well.

26
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:11,720
I was worried that it would be inauspicious for you to die in my residence.

27
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,312
Don't worry. I am blessed.

28
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:24,272
Are you trying to escape?

29
00:06:25,560 --> 00:06:26,632
Since I'm fine,

30
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:28,233
I should go back.

31
00:06:29,703 --> 00:06:30,791
Mr. Mei,

32
00:06:31,240 --> 00:06:33,593
are you saying that the Duke's Residence doesn't take good care of you

33
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:35,993
or do you simply not want to stay here?

34
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,353
I don't want to stay here.

35
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:44,153
If I stay here,

36
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,560
people will gossip.

37
00:06:47,439 --> 00:06:49,752
It's bad for your reputation, Lady Wu Zhen.

38
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:55,512
Don't need to worry about this.

39
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:11,312
Lady Wu Zhen

40
00:07:11,439 --> 00:07:13,993
is a woman with no maidenly reputation.

41
00:07:14,959 --> 00:07:16,080
What she did last night

42
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,480
has spread all over Chang'an before dawn.

43
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:21,153
- What do you mean?   - Last night, at the Lantern Festival,

44
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,679
Princess Qinghe pulled Mr. Mei

45
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,473
to a private meeting on top of the city tower.

46
00:07:25,920 --> 00:07:28,199
Mr. Mei refused. What do you think happened?

47
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,752
- What?   - Princess Qinghe broke his leg.

48
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:37,192
God couldn't bear to see it.

49
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:39,752
The lanterns fell and caught fire.

50
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:42,339
- Is this true?   - Absolutely.

51
00:07:42,439 --> 00:07:45,119
My sixth uncle's brother-in-law's nephew

52
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:46,512
is an imperial guard.

53
00:07:46,920 --> 00:07:48,752
Both of them fell from the tower.

54
00:07:48,839 --> 00:07:51,033
He protected the empress when she checked on them.

55
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:53,759
- I heard it myself.   - That's wrong.

56
00:07:53,839 --> 00:07:55,720
My fourth uncle's cousin's daughter

57
00:07:55,800 --> 00:07:57,473
who serves Consort Mei

58
00:07:57,600 --> 00:07:58,759
said something different.

59
00:07:58,839 --> 00:07:59,840
What did she say?

60
00:07:59,927 --> 00:08:01,399
- Yes.   - She said

61
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:05,432
it was Mr. Mei who clung to Princess Qinghe.

62
00:08:05,551 --> 00:08:06,904
He threatened Princess Qinghe

63
00:08:07,079 --> 00:08:09,872
to bring him to the Duke's Residence with his life.

64
00:08:10,279 --> 00:08:12,113
Both of you are saying...

65
00:08:12,438 --> 00:08:14,118
Yes. Everyone is telling a different story.

66
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,113
- Mine is...   - Are the members of royalty

67
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:18,879
so daring right now?

68
00:08:18,959 --> 00:08:20,432
I don't know about that.

69
00:08:20,839 --> 00:08:23,312
But I know those who work in the palace

70
00:08:23,480 --> 00:08:24,593
have bad hearing.

71
00:08:32,519 --> 00:08:34,552
Mr. Mei loves to eat Braised Eggplant.

72
00:08:38,768 --> 00:08:39,978
Mr. Mei, you're back...

73
00:08:43,607 --> 00:08:45,601
- Hasn't Brother Mei returned?   - Any news about Mr. Mei?

74
00:08:45,775 --> 00:08:47,080
I heard

75
00:08:47,215 --> 00:08:48,880
Brother Mei and Princess Qinghe

76
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,241
fell from the tower last night.

77
00:08:50,327 --> 00:08:51,520
He even got hurt

78
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,759
but he went missing.

79
00:08:52,958 --> 00:08:54,320
Mr. Mei is injured?

80
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,679
- Princess Qinghe is such a jinx.   - What did you say?

81
00:08:59,608 --> 00:09:01,009
You are a poor relative

82
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:02,751
who does nothing and wanders the streets all day.

83
00:09:02,834 --> 00:09:04,253
You bring bad luck as soon as you arrive.

84
00:09:04,342 --> 00:09:05,416
You are the jinx!

85
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:07,672
Who are you calling a jinx?

86
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:10,113
You! You are a huge jinx!

87
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:12,552
Mr. Mei was busy working every day to make more money

88
00:09:12,799 --> 00:09:14,919
because you eat a lot at home every day.

89
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,353
If he hadn't worked so hard,

90
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:18,839
he wouldn't have been so weak

91
00:09:18,919 --> 00:09:20,953
and fallen from the tower for no reason.

92
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:23,839
In the end, it's your fault for being a glutton!

93
00:09:23,919 --> 00:09:25,272
You insubordinate servant!

94
00:09:25,353 --> 00:09:26,366
- Mr. Mei.   - Brother Mei.

95
00:09:27,919 --> 00:09:29,233
I'm here to deliver a letter.

96
00:09:29,879 --> 00:09:31,193
Mr. Mei hurt his leg.

97
00:09:31,320 --> 00:09:34,032
He has to stay in the Duke's Residence recently.

98
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,552
The Duke's Residence?

99
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,392
Was it true that they fell from the tower?

100
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,319
How did he hurt his leg?

101
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:42,433
Is it serious? Can he still work in the future?

102
00:09:42,559 --> 00:09:45,713
Don't worry. It's not serious right now.

103
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,113
Lady Wu Zhen is taking good care of him.

104
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:51,152
He'll be healthy when he returns.

105
00:09:55,039 --> 00:09:58,512
Lady Wu Zhen, it's not right for me to stay here.

106
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,360
Moreover, the Arcane Appraisal Bureau...

107
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:02,872
I've informed the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

108
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:04,792
There haven't been any cases recently.

109
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,360
There's no reason for them

110
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:09,752
to order an injured person to work while crippling.

111
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:11,632
- But...   - Enough.

112
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:15,039
You saved me so I will take care of you. Listen to me.

113
00:10:16,799 --> 00:10:18,113
Don't worry about work.

114
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:20,792
I am a princess after all.

115
00:10:21,039 --> 00:10:22,593
It's no problem for me

116
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:23,953
to feed ten of you.

117
00:10:24,919 --> 00:10:26,233
You're trying to feed ten of me?

118
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:30,392
Is your leg connected to your brain?

119
00:10:31,639 --> 00:10:32,993
One of your legs is crippled

120
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:34,801
and you're only hearing half of what I said.

121
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:37,679
In my opinion,

122
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,599
Lady Wu Zhen was very worried

123
00:10:39,679 --> 00:10:41,353
and took care of Commissioner Mei for one night.

124
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:43,993
There's no need to be so harsh on him.

125
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:46,713
I was foolish.

126
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,632
Thank you for taking care of me, Lady Wu Zhen.

127
00:10:49,919 --> 00:10:51,193
Don't worry, Commissioner Mei.

128
00:10:51,599 --> 00:10:53,312
I sent a letter to your residence.

129
00:10:53,403 --> 00:10:54,516
Just stay here without worries.

130
00:10:54,612 --> 00:10:55,639
Thank you.

131
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:56,833
I didn't return for one night.

132
00:10:57,039 --> 00:10:58,313
They will surely be worried.

133
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:00,073
They are worried

134
00:11:00,559 --> 00:11:01,593
but

135
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:03,752
they are still very energetic.

136
00:11:19,919 --> 00:11:21,353
I wanted to ask last night.

137
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:23,713
Lady Wu Zhen,

138
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,672
have you fallen for Mr. Mei?

139
00:11:27,840 --> 00:11:29,433
Otherwise, why would you be so anxious?

140
00:11:30,799 --> 00:11:32,152
It was an emergency last night.

141
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,313
After the Undecaying Bone incident,

142
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,113
my powers hadn't recovered.

143
00:11:36,879 --> 00:11:38,672
Without his help,

144
00:11:39,919 --> 00:11:42,993
I would be the one laying there perhaps.

145
00:11:43,159 --> 00:11:45,392
The Cat Lord wouldn't be defeated so easily.

146
00:11:45,559 --> 00:11:47,152
Moreover, he's just a mortal.

147
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:48,953
Whether he helps you or not is not important.

148
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:51,233
Cat Lord isn't invincible.

149
00:11:53,159 --> 00:11:54,752
I'm afraid of pain and death as well.

150
00:11:56,383 --> 00:11:58,984
- Let's go.   - Where to?

151
00:12:00,387 --> 00:12:03,027
Didn't you say Shu was awake? Let's visit him.

152
00:12:48,393 --> 00:12:50,724
I remember how you hated medicine when you were young.

153
00:12:50,919 --> 00:12:52,872
Later, I found this candy accidentally.

154
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:54,392
You liked it a lot.

155
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:56,313
You would only take your medicine with this candy.

156
00:12:57,440 --> 00:12:58,593
Later, I found out

157
00:12:58,759 --> 00:13:00,272
you only ate the candy

158
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,073
without taking the medicine.

159
00:13:03,679 --> 00:13:06,593
Eat less. Otherwise, you will be called Fat Zhen instead.

160
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,593
Back then,

161
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,993
I was so fat because I ate too much candy.

162
00:13:16,200 --> 00:13:17,313
I couldn't hide it at all.

163
00:13:18,879 --> 00:13:21,632
However, the candy was nice indeed.

164
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:24,752
I remember the candy shop was far.

165
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,160
You would find it troublesome to go there every time.

166
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:30,120
In the end, you worked with

167
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:32,120
the shop's owner

168
00:13:32,200 --> 00:13:34,439
to move his shop beside the bookstore.

169
00:13:34,519 --> 00:13:38,713
Of course. I will help you get what you want.

170
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:45,672
I'll be taking this candy then.

171
00:13:46,039 --> 00:13:47,600
Sure. But

172
00:13:48,159 --> 00:13:49,433
don't eat too much.

173
00:14:03,005 --> 00:14:05,318
What? Are you purposely waiting for me?

174
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:08,073
Yes. I heard you've always been here.

175
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,233
I came here to talk business with you.

176
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,552
How is Xuan Hui?

177
00:14:13,639 --> 00:14:15,073
I lured him to the East side of the city

178
00:14:15,240 --> 00:14:16,593
and wanted to capture him

179
00:14:16,879 --> 00:14:18,193
but I let him escape.

180
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:20,113
You must keep an eye on him.

181
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,872
Don't let him hurt the people of Chang'an.

182
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:23,993
He is hurt now.

183
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:26,272
I don't think he will cause any trouble.

184
00:14:26,559 --> 00:14:27,792
Xuan Hui might be mischievous

185
00:14:27,919 --> 00:14:29,713
and tried to escape the Demon Prison multiple times

186
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:32,152
but he has never hurt a mortal before.

187
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,672
He escaped the Demon Prison

188
00:14:34,957 --> 00:14:36,668
and appeared at the Lantern Festival this time.

189
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:39,593
- I'm afraid...   - There's someone helping him in the shadows.

190
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,353
Someone helped him escape using the power of Divine Thunder.

191
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:45,240
The only person who can do that

192
00:14:45,320 --> 00:14:46,433
is Elder Gray.

193
00:14:48,039 --> 00:14:49,039
I think so.

194
00:14:49,240 --> 00:14:50,713
They probably had a deal with each other.

195
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:52,953
How is Elder Gray doing now?

196
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,520
He has been confined in the Demon Prison.

197
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,227
I've ordered more men to keep an eye on him.

198
00:14:57,799 --> 00:14:59,353
He caused trouble time after time

199
00:15:00,080 --> 00:15:01,713
because of me.

200
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,524
I need to settle things with him once and for all.

201
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,032
What do you plan to do?

202
00:15:08,116 --> 00:15:10,118
I'll decide when I'm done with my work in the next few days.

203
00:15:11,577 --> 00:15:12,579
What work?

204
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:15,679
Taking care of a patient.

205
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,113
Mr. Mei.

206
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,752
Where are you going?

207
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,593
The boss is

208
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,752
really doing her best

209
00:16:47,080 --> 00:16:48,833
day and night.

210
00:17:06,920 --> 00:17:07,993
What are you carrying?

211
00:17:10,557 --> 00:17:11,640
Your Ladyship,

212
00:17:13,759 --> 00:17:15,320
Mr. Mei said he had rested for days

213
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
and was feeling uncomfortable.

214
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:17,480
He wants to take a bath.

215
00:17:17,680 --> 00:17:19,792
We are sending him some new clothes.

216
00:17:26,759 --> 00:17:27,832
It's not right

217
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:30,633
for all of you to be there when he's taking a bath.

218
00:18:12,800 --> 00:18:13,844
Who is it?

219
00:18:16,887 --> 00:18:18,390
I'm here to deliver you clean clothes.

220
00:18:22,000 --> 00:18:23,233
Why do you come here in person?

221
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,713
Who do you want?

222
00:18:27,920 --> 00:18:29,072
That's not what I mean.

223
00:18:30,599 --> 00:18:32,352
Mr. Mei, have you heard about the story

224
00:18:32,839 --> 00:18:34,312
of stolen clothes?

225
00:18:35,156 --> 00:18:36,241
What story is that?

226
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,512
Once upon a time, there was a mortal man

227
00:18:39,759 --> 00:18:41,032
who makes his living through farming.

228
00:18:41,279 --> 00:18:42,673
He lived a poor life.

229
00:18:43,438 --> 00:18:44,480
One day,

230
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,320
a miraculous sign

231
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:48,633
appeared on his farm.

232
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:51,272
The sign told him

233
00:18:51,759 --> 00:18:52,953
that a divine lady

234
00:18:53,599 --> 00:18:56,193
would take a bath in the stream three days later.

235
00:18:57,279 --> 00:18:59,233
The man had his doubts but he still went there.

236
00:18:59,513 --> 00:19:01,475
He met a lady indeed.

237
00:19:02,519 --> 00:19:05,832
The lady was pretty and the man fell for her immediately.

238
00:19:06,039 --> 00:19:08,473
So, he followed the sign

239
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:11,072
and took the lady's clothes by the stream.

240
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:12,873
When the lady finished bathing,

241
00:19:13,000 --> 00:19:14,433
she realized her clothes were gone

242
00:19:14,759 --> 00:19:16,312
so she could only stay in the water.

243
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:18,752
The man appeared

244
00:19:19,160 --> 00:19:20,633
and they fell for each other.

245
00:19:20,785 --> 00:19:21,839
Later,

246
00:19:22,599 --> 00:19:24,153
the divine lady stayed in the mortal realm

247
00:19:24,839 --> 00:19:26,592
and became the man's wife.

248
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:30,752
Both of them worked hard and lived happily ever after.

249
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,752
What do you think? Is it touching?

250
00:19:36,092 --> 00:19:37,261
Did you

251
00:19:38,119 --> 00:19:40,112
make up this story, Lady Wu Zhen?

252
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,552
Of course, not.

253
00:19:42,098 --> 00:19:43,934
It was written in the storybook of the previous era.

254
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,953
There's such an absurd story in the storybook?

255
00:19:48,839 --> 00:19:49,839
How is it absurd?

256
00:19:51,640 --> 00:19:55,120
The Divine Lady fell for someone

257
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,312
who stole her clothes?

258
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:00,792
Perhaps...

259
00:20:02,279 --> 00:20:04,032
Perhaps the man was handsome.

260
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,832
A person's heart shows their true character.

261
00:20:08,417 --> 00:20:10,250
This man has a bad character.

262
00:20:12,359 --> 00:20:14,112
Just because the man took her clothes?

263
00:20:15,720 --> 00:20:17,153
The man lived a poor life

264
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,552
but he didn't want to work hard to change his life

265
00:20:19,920 --> 00:20:22,633
and wanted to get married to change his fate instead.

266
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:25,592
What will you do

267
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:27,832
if it were you?

268
00:20:28,200 --> 00:20:29,279
I only know

269
00:20:29,789 --> 00:20:31,433
that if he was sincere towards the Divine Lady,

270
00:20:31,920 --> 00:20:33,080
he should be well-prepared

271
00:20:33,160 --> 00:20:34,233
before proposing

272
00:20:34,985 --> 00:20:37,634
instead of pulling the lady he fancies in the same situation

273
00:20:38,319 --> 00:20:41,153
before he has a stable life.

274
00:20:43,279 --> 00:20:46,592
There does seem to be a flaw in the story.

275
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:48,552
Perhaps I remember it wrongly.

276
00:20:53,279 --> 00:20:54,433
Are you mocking me?

277
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:56,673
I'm not.

278
00:20:57,240 --> 00:20:59,720
We are different.

279
00:21:03,934 --> 00:21:05,079
How so?

280
00:21:08,799 --> 00:21:11,592
Are you sure you want us to chat like this?

281
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:37,556
(Mei Residence)

282
00:21:40,611 --> 00:21:42,071
The "Compendium of Demons"

283
00:21:43,640 --> 00:21:45,032
is really interesting.

284
00:21:55,119 --> 00:21:56,752
Stop wasting your energy.

285
00:22:08,370 --> 00:22:09,408
Take a bite.

286
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:11,752
You mortal.

287
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:13,713
Do you think I'm a vegetarian?

288
00:22:20,950 --> 00:22:22,277
Are you afraid?

289
00:22:22,680 --> 00:22:25,713
You're not going to bow after meeting me?

290
00:22:26,326 --> 00:22:27,397
You...

291
00:22:28,319 --> 00:22:29,552
You can speak?

292
00:22:32,191 --> 00:22:33,374
Are you...

293
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:35,433
Are you a loach spirit?

294
00:22:37,079 --> 00:22:38,233
Loach spirit?

295
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:41,079
- I am the Black Snake.   - Black Snake?

296
00:22:42,599 --> 00:22:44,552
Black Snake.

297
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:52,312
It only talks about the loach spirit here.

298
00:22:55,160 --> 00:22:57,359
What is this place? Why am I here?

299
00:22:59,129 --> 00:23:00,205
Lady Liu!

300
00:23:01,599 --> 00:23:02,599
Lady Liu!

301
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:04,603
Lady Liu...

302
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
Who's splashing water?

303
00:23:11,433 --> 00:23:12,525
Who's splashing water?

304
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,193
A small loach.

305
00:23:27,279 --> 00:23:29,193
Did I crush him with my weight?

306
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:32,006
Little Loach.

307
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,233
I swear

308
00:23:35,599 --> 00:23:36,759
I met you by chance.

309
00:23:36,839 --> 00:23:38,112
I knew nothing else.

310
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:39,913
You only met me by chance.

311
00:23:40,279 --> 00:23:41,873
There was no need to save me.

312
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,193
I couldn't

313
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,473
ignore you.

314
00:23:53,079 --> 00:23:54,673
You lose in a fight?

315
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:01,752
Why did you save me?

316
00:24:02,109 --> 00:24:03,342
Why do I save you?

317
00:24:04,279 --> 00:24:05,873
Do you think I can ignore you?

318
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:19,660
You mortal.

319
00:24:19,741 --> 00:24:20,952
Why are you looking at me like that?

320
00:24:21,839 --> 00:24:24,112
The White Serpent didn't lie to me.

321
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:27,352
Demons and spirits don't just appear in the legends.

322
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:29,393
I picked up a small demon today.

323
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,072
I'm not a small demon!

324
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:40,352
Is this your power?

325
00:24:40,839 --> 00:24:42,393
It's really cute.

326
00:24:42,759 --> 00:24:43,913
Show me another one.

327
00:24:44,096 --> 00:24:46,941
No. Let me bring you to see someone. Show him.

328
00:24:47,038 --> 00:24:48,398
I have a noble identity

329
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:50,520
and you want me to perform?

330
00:24:52,741 --> 00:24:53,952
Can't you?

331
00:24:54,599 --> 00:24:55,792
When I recover,

332
00:24:56,079 --> 00:24:58,193
I will bite you to death.

333
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,359
Does it mean

334
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:02,455
you were an amazing little demon before you got hurt?

335
00:25:02,545 --> 00:25:03,599
Of course.

336
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:06,752
A despicable person used some kind of heavy object

337
00:25:07,000 --> 00:25:08,039
to crush my head

338
00:25:08,119 --> 00:25:09,239
when I was taking form.

339
00:25:09,319 --> 00:25:10,473
Otherwise, I wouldn't end up here.

340
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:12,993
I wonder what it was.

341
00:25:13,359 --> 00:25:15,953
If I find out, I'll chop it into pieces!

342
00:25:19,960 --> 00:25:21,952
Mortal, do you know something?

343
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:23,190
I know nothing.

344
00:25:23,982 --> 00:25:26,336
Are you hungry? Let me bring you some cabbage.

345
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:27,468
I'm not eating.

346
00:25:28,480 --> 00:25:30,600
I think you're dirty. Let's take a bath.

347
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:33,233
- Don't touch me.   - I won't touch you. Take a bath on your own.

348
00:25:33,314 --> 00:25:34,495
I won't wash on my own.

349
00:25:41,000 --> 00:25:42,153
I wonder if Mr. Mei

350
00:25:42,759 --> 00:25:44,953
is used to the Duke's Residence's meals.

351
00:25:45,559 --> 00:25:47,792
I don't know whether Brother Mei is used to staying there

352
00:25:47,960 --> 00:25:49,552
but I'm sure of one thing.

353
00:25:49,631 --> 00:25:50,676
What is it?

354
00:25:51,240 --> 00:25:52,552
The food at the Duke's Residence

355
00:25:52,839 --> 00:25:55,393
is so much better than your bland food.

356
00:25:56,974 --> 00:25:58,110
Nonsense!

357
00:25:58,440 --> 00:25:59,993
Mr. Mei cares about the food source.

358
00:26:00,279 --> 00:26:02,393
Bland food helps with nurturing a person's body and mind.

359
00:26:02,600 --> 00:26:04,479
A boar like you doesn't deserve food like this.

360
00:26:04,560 --> 00:26:05,639
Who are you calling a boar?

361
00:26:05,720 --> 00:26:07,820
- Who makes bland food?   - Are you trying to start a fight?

362
00:26:07,901 --> 00:26:10,028
I respect Mr. Mei. Otherwise, I would've hit you eight times.

363
00:26:10,119 --> 00:26:11,640
- Someone like you...   - Trying to hit me?

364
00:26:11,720 --> 00:26:13,680
- I can fight ten of you!   - Are you guys fighting?

365
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,200
- Please continue.   - He's unworthy.

366
00:26:18,535 --> 00:26:19,872
You are the one who's unworthy.

367
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:23,673
I'm here to deliver Brother Mei's salary this month.

368
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:39,032
Is Brother Mei so stingy in private?

369
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,233
Is this all he's giving you every month?

370
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,713
This is for Mr. Mei.

371
00:26:46,519 --> 00:26:47,713
These are mine.

372
00:26:50,079 --> 00:26:51,279
You take so much money every month

373
00:26:51,359 --> 00:26:52,673
and only give Brother Mei so little?

374
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:55,000
- No wonder he eats bland food every day.   - I...

375
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,433
I told you many times. Mr. Mei likes the food.

376
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,673
Why are you eating as well?

377
00:27:01,759 --> 00:27:03,560
Isn't it too presumptuous of you?

378
00:27:03,640 --> 00:27:04,920
It's fine.

379
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:06,473
What do you mean?

380
00:27:07,599 --> 00:27:09,560
You! If you are not used to the food I make,

381
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,072
Go out, turn left, and make your own food.

382
00:27:12,079 --> 00:27:14,873
I'm sure you are Brother Mei's cousin.

383
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:16,759
- Shuang Jiang, right?   - Yes.

384
00:27:19,306 --> 00:27:20,402
Both of you, come here.

385
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:23,193
I'm sure both of you know

386
00:27:23,400 --> 00:27:25,519
that Brother Mei is at the Duke's Residence, right?

387
00:27:25,599 --> 00:27:26,760
Of course.

388
00:27:27,019 --> 00:27:29,119
When Brother Mei is used to the Duke Residence's food,

389
00:27:29,305 --> 00:27:31,120
he'll probably change his chef when he returns.

390
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,600
He'll get rid of you first.

391
00:27:32,838 --> 00:27:34,363
How can he change his cousin? You'll be sacked.

392
00:27:34,441 --> 00:27:35,832
You! It's you!

393
00:27:36,007 --> 00:27:37,599
That's not important.

394
00:27:37,799 --> 00:27:39,032
The important thing is

395
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:41,393
whether Brother Mei can still come back.

396
00:27:42,279 --> 00:27:44,352
I'm sure he can come back.

397
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:46,239
The Duke's Residence doesn't eat people.

398
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,792
But the Princess does.

399
00:27:48,720 --> 00:27:52,193
Look. Brother Mei is young and capable

400
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:55,272
but the Duke's Residence is powerful.

401
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:59,233
Moreover, Princess Qinghe is a domineering lady.

402
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,473
So,

403
00:28:02,839 --> 00:28:04,433
even before they got married,

404
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,920
Brother Mei was dragged to the Duke's Residence.

405
00:28:07,119 --> 00:28:08,792
People are already placing bets

406
00:28:09,079 --> 00:28:10,233
about whether

407
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:13,999
Princess Qinghe is marrying into the Mei family

408
00:28:14,079 --> 00:28:17,193
or Commissioner Mei is marrying into the Duke's Residence.

409
00:28:19,195 --> 00:28:20,323
Then,

410
00:28:21,160 --> 00:28:22,473
are you saying

411
00:28:23,720 --> 00:28:25,032
that Mr. Mei

412
00:28:25,539 --> 00:28:26,934
is going to become a matrilocal husband?

413
00:28:58,359 --> 00:28:59,473
Brother Mei

414
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:01,200
is getting married?

415
00:29:27,017 --> 00:29:29,057
- No!   - I can't wait any longer!

416
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:33,319
Where are you two going? Aren't you eating?

417
00:29:33,417 --> 00:29:35,504
(Duke Wu's Residence)

418
00:29:46,079 --> 00:29:47,559
- Brother Mei!   - Mr. Mei!

419
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,792
Are both of you looking for Commissioner Mei?

420
00:29:52,708 --> 00:29:54,336
- Hand over Mr. Mei!   - Hand over Brother Mei!

421
00:29:54,720 --> 00:29:57,153
Just go in that direction and walk forward.

422
00:29:57,559 --> 00:30:00,233
He's in the second courtyard.

423
00:30:07,412 --> 00:30:08,556
- Brother Mei!   - Mr. Mei!

424
00:30:08,685 --> 00:30:09,760
Brother Mei!

425
00:30:09,917 --> 00:30:11,230
- Brother Mei!   - Mr. Mei!

426
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:12,680
Why are you here?

427
00:30:13,686 --> 00:30:14,920
- Brother Mei!   - Mr. Mei!

428
00:30:19,512 --> 00:30:20,840
Brother Mei.

429
00:30:21,527 --> 00:30:22,572
Are you hurt?

430
00:30:22,781 --> 00:30:24,880
Were you taken advantage of? Did you lose your chastity?

431
00:30:25,018 --> 00:30:26,020
Stop talking nonsense.

432
00:30:26,838 --> 00:30:29,391
Mr. Mei, do you still remember me?

433
00:30:29,960 --> 00:30:31,439
Do you feel weird?

434
00:30:31,519 --> 00:30:34,480
Don't worry. I'm fine and I still remember you.

435
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:37,640
It's good that you remember me.

436
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:39,920
I'm afraid you fell and hurt your brain.

437
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:42,360
You are the one who hurt your brain. He hurt his leg.

438
00:30:42,440 --> 00:30:44,032
Don't you think I know that?

439
00:30:44,640 --> 00:30:45,792
Mr. Mei, let me massage your leg.

440
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:48,792
- It hurts.   - You'll be fine after my massage.

441
00:30:48,891 --> 00:30:49,921
Wen Hua.

442
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:54,312
Did you not return home for so long

443
00:30:55,079 --> 00:30:57,393
because you will miss the food and luxury here?

444
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,319
- Or do you not like my food?   - No.

445
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:04,552
I can't go out.

446
00:31:04,920 --> 00:31:06,913
Right, Brother Mei. You should recuperate here.

447
00:31:07,039 --> 00:31:08,759
His food is bad anyway.

448
00:31:08,839 --> 00:31:10,272
Why do you still eat so much, then?

449
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,360
Mr. Mei, do you want to bask in the sun in the courtyard?

450
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:15,873
I heard it helps with recovery.

451
00:31:27,000 --> 00:31:28,193
Zhu Yu,

452
00:31:28,440 --> 00:31:29,440
what's going on actually?

453
00:31:31,683 --> 00:31:34,635
The chaos during the Lantern Festival might not be caused by humans.

454
00:31:34,716 --> 00:31:35,720
What...

455
00:31:37,354 --> 00:31:38,482
What did you say?

456
00:31:40,632 --> 00:31:43,385
Didn't you feel anything that night?

457
00:31:44,175 --> 00:31:45,340
That night...

458
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:47,713
I was busy

459
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:49,112
and didn't pay attention.

460
00:31:50,680 --> 00:31:53,233
If there's more to this than meets the eye,

461
00:31:53,640 --> 00:31:55,880
it might be related to the Demon City.

462
00:31:55,960 --> 00:31:57,473
This time, I might have a chance

463
00:31:58,200 --> 00:31:59,592
to find out where Demon City is located.

464
00:32:01,480 --> 00:32:03,713
- You are right.   - My leg is hurt now.

465
00:32:04,039 --> 00:32:05,752
I need you to ask around

466
00:32:05,841 --> 00:32:07,636
and find clues about the strange incident.

467
00:32:07,799 --> 00:32:10,873
No problem. I'm good at these tasks.

468
00:32:12,160 --> 00:32:13,839
- However...   - What's wrong?

469
00:32:14,880 --> 00:32:16,999
News has spread around Chang'an.

470
00:32:17,079 --> 00:32:18,975
They say your leg is broken

471
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:21,024
and that you are going to marry into the Duke's Residence.

472
00:32:21,119 --> 00:32:22,473
What nonsense is that?

473
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:25,193
I knew it was nonsense.

474
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:26,913
There's nothing between you and the princess.

475
00:32:31,910 --> 00:32:33,045
Zhu Yu.

476
00:32:35,240 --> 00:32:36,272
There's indeed something

477
00:32:37,599 --> 00:32:38,993
between me and the princess.

478
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,473
What do you mean?

479
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:44,072
Have you been taken advantage of?

480
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:47,752
It's my fault.

481
00:32:49,342 --> 00:32:50,400
I think

482
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:54,112
I've fallen for her.

483
00:33:00,147 --> 00:33:01,246
Fallen for her?

484
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:03,713
What do you mean?

485
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:07,072
When people are young, they like their parents.

486
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:11,112
When people grow up, they like young girls.

487
00:33:11,920 --> 00:33:14,072
I like her

488
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:15,993
the way men and women like each other.

489
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:18,832
Zhu Yu,

490
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:20,993
how could you be charmed by a vixen?

491
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:22,713
She isn't a vixen.

492
00:33:23,511 --> 00:33:24,625
She didn't charm me.

493
00:33:24,706 --> 00:33:25,756
Zhu Yu,

494
00:33:26,519 --> 00:33:28,233
have you forgotten the fact

495
00:33:28,400 --> 00:33:30,512
that disciples of Changxi Palace can't fall for anyone?

496
00:33:30,593 --> 00:33:31,741
I haven't.

497
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:34,673
Neither of you will end up well.

498
00:33:35,640 --> 00:33:37,512
I didn't plan to marry her.

499
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,512
You like her

500
00:33:40,119 --> 00:33:41,512
but you don't plan to marry her?

501
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:43,713
Why don't I get it?

502
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,592
You asked me about my opinion

503
00:33:47,240 --> 00:33:48,873
so I told you the truth.

504
00:33:49,480 --> 00:33:50,512
That's all.

505
00:33:51,920 --> 00:33:53,072
I've been reading poems lately.

506
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:54,473
One of the poems said

507
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:57,153
One needs to be free

508
00:33:58,160 --> 00:34:00,393
and not be bound by worldly relationships.

509
00:34:01,632 --> 00:34:02,751
I might like her

510
00:34:02,839 --> 00:34:04,193
but there's something holding me back.

511
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:08,032
I don't ask for an end result.

512
00:34:09,150 --> 00:34:11,313
Zhu Yu, since young,

513
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:13,592
you've been like the moon to me, you're hard to reach.

514
00:34:13,840 --> 00:34:15,032
It might be difficult,

515
00:34:15,360 --> 00:34:17,152
but all cultivators hope to become deities.

516
00:34:17,503 --> 00:34:19,257
If a person can do that, it's definitely you.

517
00:34:19,338 --> 00:34:20,719
You have been indifferent since young.

518
00:34:20,800 --> 00:34:22,632
You don't have an interest in many things.

519
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:24,712
After meeting you in Chang'an,

520
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:27,680
I realized you were different.

521
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,039
Look. You've started reading poems.

522
00:34:30,119 --> 00:34:31,974
You didn't read all these useless things in the past!

523
00:34:32,199 --> 00:34:34,313
Zhu Yu, I don't get it.

524
00:34:36,599 --> 00:34:37,833
Perhaps it's because

525
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,592
the night is too cold

526
00:34:43,559 --> 00:34:45,273
so I wanted a glimmer of hope.

527
00:35:07,733 --> 00:35:08,897
Slowly.

528
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:23,273
Mr. Mei, we'll be going home first.

529
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:27,353
Don't fight after you go back home.

530
00:35:29,239 --> 00:35:31,119
- Don't worry.   - Don't worry. Let's go.

531
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:45,552
He is afraid of cats.

532
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:48,192
Should I leave?

533
00:35:49,639 --> 00:35:51,313
But I am a cat now.

534
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:54,313
I can't be understanding.

535
00:36:00,285 --> 00:36:02,597
However, leaving after meeting a human

536
00:36:03,360 --> 00:36:04,712
is reasonable.

537
00:36:06,706 --> 00:36:07,830
Little Cat.

538
00:36:07,960 --> 00:36:10,273
Impossible. He will never know it's me.

539
00:36:10,760 --> 00:36:11,953
Can you not come down?

540
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,512
(Zhu Yu came to the mortal world)

541
00:36:41,079 --> 00:36:42,552
(and actually fell for someone.)

542
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:45,993
(Should I tell the seniors?)

543
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,840
I'll tell them. I won't tell them.

544
00:36:56,039 --> 00:36:57,800
I'll tell them. I won't tell them.

545
00:36:57,880 --> 00:36:59,639
I'll tell them. I won't tell them.

546
00:36:59,719 --> 00:37:00,913
I'll tell them.

547
00:37:04,239 --> 00:37:05,433
I'll give you another chance.

548
00:37:06,159 --> 00:37:07,720
I'll tell them. I won't tell them.

549
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,240
I'll tell them. I won't tell them.

550
00:37:09,320 --> 00:37:11,760
I'll tell them. I won't tell them. I'll tell...

551
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:16,552
There's no choice, then.

552
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:18,232
It's destined.

553
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,993
I can't let Zhu Yu stay in Chang'an anymore.

554
00:37:22,079 --> 00:37:23,353
What should I do?

555
00:37:24,039 --> 00:37:25,353
If I tell them honestly,

556
00:37:25,559 --> 00:37:27,512
Zhu Yu will be punished by the sect.

557
00:37:27,920 --> 00:37:29,112
If I don't tell them the truth...

558
00:37:31,710 --> 00:37:32,886
Got it.

559
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,433
Since Chang'an has demons

560
00:37:36,639 --> 00:37:38,232
and caused Zhu Yu to be injured,

561
00:37:38,631 --> 00:37:40,511
I'll ask Senior to summon him to recuperate.

562
00:37:40,599 --> 00:37:41,753
It's completely reasonable.

563
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,072
Now, I can split both of them

564
00:37:44,519 --> 00:37:45,519
without lying.

565
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:01,672
Perfect.

566
00:38:03,360 --> 00:38:04,512
I'm really smart.

567
00:38:37,070 --> 00:38:38,464
He's getting back to work

568
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:41,273
as soon as he's feeling better.

569
00:40:33,038 --> 00:40:35,639
(Demon Banishment Scroll)

570
00:40:39,648 --> 00:40:40,671
Make way.

571
00:40:58,750 --> 00:40:59,804
Cat Lord.

572
00:41:16,880 --> 00:41:18,552
Greetings, Elder Gray.

573
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:29,473
Cat Lord, it's you?

574
00:41:33,208 --> 00:41:34,253
What?

575
00:41:34,679 --> 00:41:35,920
Are you here

576
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:38,152
to welcome me back

577
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,993
because I'll soon be released after my repentance period?

578
00:41:49,320 --> 00:41:50,353
I get it now.

579
00:41:50,427 --> 00:41:52,608
Something weird was going on in the Demon Prison a few days ago.

580
00:41:53,559 --> 00:41:55,953
I heard it was Xuan Hui who escaped.

581
00:41:56,119 --> 00:41:58,313
Are you here because of him?

582
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,032
Do you need my help?

583
00:42:03,079 --> 00:42:04,079
Elder Gray,

584
00:42:04,159 --> 00:42:05,592
stop pretending.

585
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:09,393
You are reluctant to accept my position as the Cat Lord

586
00:42:10,159 --> 00:42:12,712
but you dare not face me in a battle as well.

587
00:42:13,800 --> 00:42:15,152
You only dare

588
00:42:15,480 --> 00:42:18,192
to do those petty and despicable affairs like a rat.

589
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:20,239
I forgot.

590
00:42:21,599 --> 00:42:23,393
You are a rat indeed.

591
00:42:29,159 --> 00:42:30,433
We've had our grudges for a long time.

592
00:42:31,239 --> 00:42:33,473
I've been thinking about a way to settle it once and for all.

593
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,353
Finally, I know what I should do.

594
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:41,273
I'll do it according to your wish, Elder Gray.

595
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,793
Winner takes all.

596
00:42:48,679 --> 00:42:50,400
What do you think?
