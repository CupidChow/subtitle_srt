00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,918
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:33,920
(Episode 5)

3
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:15,589
Who's there?

4
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:18,152
Young Master, what's wrong?

5
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:23,760
What do you need?

6
00:02:29,274 --> 00:02:31,547
Nothing. I think I heard wrongly.

7
00:02:31,693 --> 00:02:33,846
All right. I shall wait for you outside.

8
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:38,513
(In Chang'an, strange omens drift in and out of view like phantoms.)

9
00:03:39,199 --> 00:03:40,872
(But whenever I get close to it,)

10
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,353
(all of their traces will vanish.)

11
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,953
(They're forever beyond my reach.)

12
00:03:48,680 --> 00:03:52,192
(What's the secret behind them?)

13
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:23,432
Say, why isn't Boss back yet?

14
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:25,272
Has she found it?

15
00:04:30,040 --> 00:04:31,512
Boss, how did it go?

16
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:34,809
Fur girl, can you stop causing a ruckus?

17
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,153
- You should sit down first.   - How could I?

18
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,713
That old rat sent a younger rat here to inquire about our progress.

19
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:45,473
These demons are impatient indeed.

20
00:04:45,920 --> 00:04:47,553
They're waiting for you to commit a mistake.

21
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,793
Tongue will surely wag against us if we fail to find the Undecaying Bone.

22
00:05:12,359 --> 00:05:13,379
Who's there?

23
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:15,072
Young Master, what's wrong?

24
00:05:30,927 --> 00:05:31,986
Shu.

25
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:35,760
What's the matter?

26
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,680
According to the law of Demon Market,

27
00:05:39,040 --> 00:05:40,832
one has to destroy an Undecaying Bone when they see one.

28
00:05:41,466 --> 00:05:44,619
We have to destroy it so that we can give the Four Sects an account.

29
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,872
My lords, if you don't stop now, the entire city will be gone!

30
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,033
Elders, don't you guys intend to help us out?

31
00:07:04,383 --> 00:07:05,385
This is...

32
00:07:07,495 --> 00:07:08,889
This isn't mere resentment.

33
00:07:09,839 --> 00:07:11,113
It's sinister aura.

34
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:13,342
Indeed. It's not an ordinary Undecaying Bone.

35
00:07:13,439 --> 00:07:14,832
It is its remains.

36
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:17,936
Whose remains?

37
00:07:21,472 --> 00:07:22,491
It.

38
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:27,872
It's the Sinister Fiend Infant

39
00:07:29,324 --> 00:07:30,796
from 18 years ago.

40
00:08:30,399 --> 00:08:33,073
Old lady, I'm glad to see you here.

41
00:08:33,805 --> 00:08:36,318
The fog is too thick. I'm lost.

42
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,073
Do you know which path I should take to descend the hill?

43
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,113
Don't you know who I am?

44
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,755
Do I know you?

45
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,152
Have we met before?

46
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:52,681
Mother!

47
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,392
Mother, what are you doing here?

48
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:02,152
It's been three years since we met.

49
00:09:02,679 --> 00:09:05,593
I missed you every day.

50
00:09:05,840 --> 00:09:10,713
My dear son, I missed you too.

51
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:12,079
Mother.

52
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:18,087
I was hoping that I could see you again one day.

53
00:09:19,081 --> 00:09:21,074
Mother, I missed you.

54
00:09:26,960 --> 00:09:29,113
Mother, I missed you.

55
00:09:33,759 --> 00:09:35,552
Mother.

56
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:55,549
Mortals are easy to deceive indeed.

57
00:09:56,763 --> 00:09:59,955
It's a shame that not many people pass by this hill.

58
00:10:00,329 --> 00:10:02,602
If I can enter Chang'an,

59
00:10:03,256 --> 00:10:07,105
cultivate my powers, seek out pleasures, and do whatever I want,

60
00:10:08,442 --> 00:10:09,955
that'll surely be the best!

61
00:10:38,536 --> 00:10:40,328
Is this place really the Records Vault?

62
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:42,353
It's so neat and tidy now.

63
00:10:42,760 --> 00:10:45,896
The old case files are actually arranged by category as well.

64
00:10:46,086 --> 00:10:47,680
You didn't have to tidy up this place to this extent.

65
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:50,788
It's only natural to fulfill the duties of one's station.

66
00:10:50,999 --> 00:10:53,169
I'm here to deliver the newest case file to you.

67
00:10:53,546 --> 00:10:54,716
You need to sort this as well.

68
00:10:54,799 --> 00:10:55,873
What case is it?

69
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:59,956
They say a villager from the western outskirts went to the mountain

70
00:11:00,243 --> 00:11:01,328
for firewood and lost his way.

71
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:04,233
Although his family managed to find him,

72
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:06,713
the man seemed far from normal.

73
00:11:07,084 --> 00:11:08,148
Far from normal?

74
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,708
In any case,

75
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,473
his eyes are open, yet he shows no consciousness.

76
00:11:12,923 --> 00:11:15,556
Although that's the case, he smiles all the time.

77
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:19,593
He kept calling for his mother.

78
00:11:19,799 --> 00:11:21,752
But his mother died from an illness long ago.

79
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:24,752
Where did the villagers lose their way?

80
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:27,552
The western outskirts. What's wrong?

81
00:11:28,039 --> 00:11:29,213
The western outskirts, huh?

82
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:33,953
It's been less than one month,

83
00:11:34,360 --> 00:11:38,272
yet the Arcane Appraisal Bureau has already received six of such cases.

84
00:11:39,658 --> 00:11:41,333
And, all of them lost their way in the western outskirts.

85
00:11:41,577 --> 00:11:43,931
I have to launch an investigation as soon as possible.

86
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,593
No need for that.

87
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:48,593
Commissioner Xu has already sent Vice Commissioner and the rest there.

88
00:11:48,879 --> 00:11:50,152
They'll obtain results soon.

89
00:12:01,639 --> 00:12:04,792
This mountain path is harder to traverse than most.

90
00:12:05,475 --> 00:12:09,349
It's only been a while, yet my sole is starting to hurt.

91
00:12:09,857 --> 00:12:11,649
It's even more exhausting than the usual guard duty.

92
00:12:12,208 --> 00:12:14,040
Why don't we head back?

93
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:17,833
Yeah. Commissioner Xu didn't take this case seriously at all.

94
00:12:18,759 --> 00:12:22,757
He sent us here just to make an appearance.

95
00:12:22,840 --> 00:12:24,353
There's no need for us to be serious.

96
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:29,912
Enough. Since we're already here, we should try to figure it out.

97
00:12:30,080 --> 00:12:32,918
If everything is normal, we can head back and report the case to them.

98
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:37,397
If I must say, I think the villagers were merely lost in the woods.

99
00:12:37,508 --> 00:12:41,580
At worst, they might have consumed some poisonous mushrooms

100
00:12:42,039 --> 00:12:43,073
that caused them to hallucinate.

101
00:12:43,784 --> 00:12:44,983
I feel the same.

102
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,593
And if they can't find their way,

103
00:12:47,735 --> 00:12:49,449
how much easier would it be for us to get lost?

104
00:13:14,840 --> 00:13:16,872
Here comes another bunch of fools.

105
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:27,032
I thought the weather was supposed to be clear.

106
00:13:27,960 --> 00:13:30,032
What's with the thick fog here?

107
00:13:30,227 --> 00:13:32,713
There's no way we can proceed. The path isn't even visible now.

108
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:36,353
Which direction were we supposed to head in again?

109
00:13:39,296 --> 00:13:40,446
Shao Heng!

110
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:56,730
Sorry for the interruption.

111
00:13:57,080 --> 00:13:59,752
We are from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

112
00:14:00,039 --> 00:14:02,593
We came here to investigate a case, but we got lost.

113
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:03,900
May I know...

114
00:14:05,320 --> 00:14:07,593
Wait. Something's off.

115
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:11,512
These are...

116
00:14:14,279 --> 00:14:18,357
Could they be the missing villagers?

117
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:21,597
They're acting strange. Are they even humans?

118
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:23,912
What nonsense are you spouting? Do you think they're ghosts, then?

119
00:14:24,559 --> 00:14:25,956
Who can know for sure?

120
00:14:26,039 --> 00:14:27,057
It's still daytime, you know?

121
00:14:28,039 --> 00:14:29,104
How could there be any ghosts?

122
00:14:37,039 --> 00:14:39,552
Why don't we go and take a look?

123
00:14:40,799 --> 00:14:42,032
Let's go and take a look.

124
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:55,953
Are you guys lost in the woods as well?

125
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,872
Can you hear me?

126
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,752
Run!

127
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:23,454
Don't come near me!

128
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:25,193
Don't come near me

129
00:15:50,447 --> 00:15:52,080
Who foiled my plan?

130
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:54,313
I've done you a huge favor.

131
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,233
Why aren't you thanking me?

132
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:04,632
You're just a rat demon.

133
00:16:06,264 --> 00:16:07,377
You think you've done me a favor?

134
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:10,993
I consume the vitality of humans to further my cultivation.

135
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:14,048
Those were ready prey for me.

136
00:16:14,208 --> 00:16:15,880
But you released them on purpose.

137
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:17,783
How dare you say that you've done me a favor?

138
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:20,552
You're acting so brazenly out in the open.

139
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,912
Do you want the Demon Market of Chang'an to notice you?

140
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:24,932
They'll capture you by then.

141
00:16:25,012 --> 00:16:27,552
I'll see if you can be this arrogant after that.

142
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,672
Are you from the Demon Market?

143
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,117
Chang'an has already heard about what you did in the western outskirts.

144
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:36,512
I assume the Demon Market will find out soon as well.

145
00:16:36,919 --> 00:16:40,792
By then, when the Two Lords are after you, you won't get to escape.

146
00:16:42,503 --> 00:16:45,417
I came here to tip you off so that I could help you out.

147
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,601
Help me out?

148
00:16:48,463 --> 00:16:50,176
Why are you trying to help me out?

149
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:57,152
It's because you can do the same for me.

150
00:16:58,954 --> 00:17:01,920
(Arcane Appraisal Bureau)

151
00:17:24,440 --> 00:17:28,552
(Where's the case file of the Divine Fire Chaos 18 years ago?)

152
00:17:42,824 --> 00:17:43,852
Commissioner.

153
00:17:44,523 --> 00:17:45,525
What do you need?

154
00:17:45,759 --> 00:17:49,597
I've arranged the case files of the Records Vault in chronological order.

155
00:17:49,680 --> 00:17:51,032
Please take a look.

156
00:17:51,759 --> 00:17:53,393
No need for that.

157
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:56,276
I believe in your abilities fully.

158
00:17:56,359 --> 00:17:57,713
But there's one thing I don't understand.

159
00:17:58,120 --> 00:17:59,205
Ask away.

160
00:17:59,359 --> 00:18:01,352
One of the case files is missing.

161
00:18:01,799 --> 00:18:03,473
It's related to an incident that happened 18 years ago.

162
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:04,869
Is that so?

163
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:08,032
So what?

164
00:18:09,240 --> 00:18:11,233
There are still many old cases left unsolved.

165
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:14,312
Perhaps we can find some clues in the past records.

166
00:18:16,704 --> 00:18:18,759
Even so, you don't need to refer to cases that happened 18 years ago.

167
00:18:18,927 --> 00:18:20,115
You were just a boy back then.

168
00:18:21,119 --> 00:18:24,079
Some cases are too dated for us to refer to.

169
00:18:24,487 --> 00:18:25,605
As an official of the court,

170
00:18:26,119 --> 00:18:28,953
it's my duty to relieve the people's sorrows and bring them justice.

171
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:33,832
The palace has an Archives Pavilion.

172
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,837
They often send their men here to retrieve case files.

173
00:18:35,920 --> 00:18:38,592
Maybe the case file you mentioned was borrowed by them.

174
00:18:38,759 --> 00:18:40,433
- If so, how can I...   - No way.

175
00:18:47,479 --> 00:18:49,873
You think that you can retrieve it from the palace?

176
00:18:50,119 --> 00:18:52,072
With your status, it's literally impossible.

177
00:18:52,279 --> 00:18:55,752
Even I, the commissioner of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau,

178
00:18:55,839 --> 00:18:59,592
could only report to the palace at the start of the month.

179
00:18:59,920 --> 00:19:01,136
What are you thinking?

180
00:19:01,217 --> 00:19:02,840
- (The commissioner, huh?)   - Commissioner Xu.

181
00:19:02,921 --> 00:19:04,040
What's wrong again?

182
00:19:04,824 --> 00:19:05,840
Commissioner Xu.

183
00:19:07,960 --> 00:19:09,153
We're in huge trouble.

184
00:19:19,247 --> 00:19:20,480
What exactly happened?

185
00:19:21,954 --> 00:19:23,308
It's the case related to the western outskirts.

186
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:25,452
Didn't Commissioner Xu send his men to investigate the case?

187
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:28,993
He did. But he said he would stay out of it upon hearing the situation.

188
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:30,919
But today, for some reason,

189
00:19:31,079 --> 00:19:34,433
villagers from the western outskirts entered Chang'an and made a plea.

190
00:19:35,160 --> 00:19:39,193
It still hasn't been decided which office will handle this case.

191
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,993
But now, Minister Liu has been alerted.

192
00:19:44,599 --> 00:19:48,233
Anyway, just instruct Zhu Ying as per Shu's instructions.

193
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,157
Cat Lord, my aide has proven rather easy to work with, huh?

194
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:55,873
Open the door! We need to see Minister Liu!

195
00:19:57,839 --> 00:19:59,014
Open the door!

196
00:20:03,287 --> 00:20:04,397
- What are you guys doing?   - Stand back!

197
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:05,877
- Back off!   - Stand back!

198
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:07,010
What are you guys doing?

199
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:09,676
- Silence!   - Be quiet.

200
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:11,437
- Minister Liu!   - Look at them.

201
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,157
Stand back! Stop gathering around!

202
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:15,236
Greetings, Minister Liu. I'm Xu Luan.

203
00:20:15,319 --> 00:20:19,473
Commissioner Xu, I assume you know

204
00:20:19,720 --> 00:20:21,312
why I summoned you today.

205
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:26,032
I know not why.

206
00:20:27,102 --> 00:20:29,535
Of course it's because of the case in the western outskirts.

207
00:20:29,920 --> 00:20:33,112
That case? I thought the yamen was supposed to handle that case.

208
00:20:33,319 --> 00:20:36,756
Six villagers went missing in the mountains in less than half a month.

209
00:20:36,839 --> 00:20:40,272
Although they were found, they were in a haze.

210
00:20:41,079 --> 00:20:42,837
It defies common sense.

211
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,756
Don't you think the Arcane Appraisal Bureau should be in charge instead?

212
00:20:45,839 --> 00:20:48,677
How are they doing, then? Are their lives in danger?

213
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:50,873
All of them have regained consciousness.

214
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:54,129
Minister Liu, the Arcane Appraisal Bureau only investigates

215
00:20:54,209 --> 00:20:56,036
cases with no leads or clues.

216
00:20:56,119 --> 00:20:59,032
Since they've regained consciousness, that means you have six witnesses.

217
00:20:59,160 --> 00:21:00,996
You should hurry and capture the culprit.

218
00:21:01,079 --> 00:21:02,433
What are you saying?

219
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,797
Are you telling me to arrest the fog?

220
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,357
It rains a lot in the mountains, so a bit of fog is nothing unusual.

221
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:11,953
As officials, you guys should create road signs for the people.

222
00:21:12,160 --> 00:21:14,557
The victims' ancestors hail from the western outskirts.

223
00:21:14,640 --> 00:21:16,276
To them, hiking the mountains is like walking in one's backyard.

224
00:21:16,359 --> 00:21:18,797
Commissioner Xu, will you get lost in your own backyard?

225
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:19,996
That's still a possibility.

226
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:21,673
- Nonsense!   - Magistrate.

227
00:21:22,616 --> 00:21:23,682
According to you,

228
00:21:24,776 --> 00:21:26,769
you think the yamen shouldn't be in charge, huh?

229
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:29,832
The yamen isn't taking charge of the case.

230
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,397
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau is doing the same.

231
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,993
You lot keep shirking your responsibilities and pushing them on each other.

232
00:21:36,440 --> 00:21:39,633
Do you expect me to investigate the case myself?

233
00:21:39,954 --> 00:21:41,036
Minister Liu, please be appeased.

234
00:21:41,119 --> 00:21:43,633
So, what do you guys plan to do now?

235
00:21:49,393 --> 00:21:50,533
You...

236
00:21:51,160 --> 00:21:52,286
Minister Liu.

237
00:21:58,200 --> 00:21:59,752
It's that mister of yours.

238
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:05,792
Isn't that Mr. Mei?

239
00:22:08,569 --> 00:22:09,608
Minister Liu.

240
00:22:10,128 --> 00:22:11,290
Drop the formalities.

241
00:22:11,559 --> 00:22:14,792
Mr. Mei, state your business.

242
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:17,433
The western outskirts span a vast territory.

243
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:19,272
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau lacks manpower.

244
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,740
Therefore, it's difficult for us to investigate the case.

245
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,913
If we have other cases to handle, I'm afraid we can't handle them all.

246
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:29,752
But this matter truly cannot be measured by common reason.

247
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:33,112
If we hand the case to the yamen, they'll have no idea what to do either.

248
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,880
- If so...   - Thus,

249
00:22:37,160 --> 00:22:40,512
I have a plan that may resolve this dilemma.

250
00:22:41,528 --> 00:22:42,594
What plan?

251
00:22:42,760 --> 00:22:45,753
I'm the keeper of the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

252
00:22:46,283 --> 00:22:48,715
Now that the case files have been organized, I have free time to spare.

253
00:22:49,119 --> 00:22:52,557
Why don't you allow me to investigate the case?

254
00:22:52,640 --> 00:22:53,663
Shut up!

255
00:22:54,680 --> 00:22:56,153
Minister Liu, give me some time.

256
00:22:57,626 --> 00:22:59,956
This is a dangerous case. Don't act tough.

257
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:01,317
Just listen to me and leave.

258
00:23:01,400 --> 00:23:04,153
Commissioner Xu, thanks for the concern. But I've already made up my mind.

259
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,713
Do not try to persuade me again.

260
00:23:05,952 --> 00:23:07,385
Minister Liu, what do you think?

261
00:23:08,865 --> 00:23:09,911
Minister Liu.

262
00:23:10,392 --> 00:23:11,466
Keeper Mei.

263
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:15,473
the Arcane Appraisal Bureau is already busy enough.

264
00:23:15,559 --> 00:23:17,233
We can't spare any manpower for you.

265
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:18,559
Let's just drop the matter.

266
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:20,312
I can investigate the case myself.

267
00:23:24,321 --> 00:23:28,032
Mr. Mei, are you sure about this?

268
00:23:28,319 --> 00:23:29,473
Are you sure you won't regret it?

269
00:23:30,032 --> 00:23:31,219
I won't.

270
00:23:31,655 --> 00:23:33,488
That mister of yours doesn't shy away from anything, huh?

271
00:23:34,376 --> 00:23:35,889
He's different from other people.

272
00:23:36,400 --> 00:23:37,953
He's bolder than most people.

273
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,993
Zhen, you should stop fretting.

274
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:58,792
How could I?

275
00:23:59,680 --> 00:24:01,503
Who would've thought that the remains of

276
00:24:01,583 --> 00:24:03,633
the Sinister Fiend Infant was still out there?

277
00:24:04,119 --> 00:24:06,512
Although I don't remember what happened 18 years ago,

278
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,032
I heard that the Sinister Fiend Infant was a powerful being.

279
00:24:10,839 --> 00:24:13,552
It went to Chang'an alone, causing great upheaval there.

280
00:24:13,759 --> 00:24:15,673
It almost destroyed the Demon Market as well.

281
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,713
If the previous Cat Lord didn't sacrifice his life to stop it, I think...

282
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:27,773
She's back.

283
00:24:32,124 --> 00:24:34,856
(Zhu Ying, Cat Lord's Assistant)

284
00:24:34,943 --> 00:24:36,118
Cat Lord.

285
00:24:36,392 --> 00:24:37,587
Serpent Lord.

286
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:39,640
Zhu Ying, long time no see.

287
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:41,592
Is there any news of the Lightning Wood?

288
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:46,039
- He was right.   - Where is it?

289
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:47,993
- The western outskirts.   - Be more detailed.

290
00:24:48,793 --> 00:24:50,004
It's in a cave.

291
00:24:50,480 --> 00:24:53,272
Shu, tell us about the Lightning Wood in detail.

292
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:57,574
Lightning Wood is a spirit-born growth,

293
00:24:57,799 --> 00:24:59,597
nurtured by the essence of Heaven's lightning.

294
00:24:59,680 --> 00:25:01,560
It's said to ward off the sinister aura of the Undecaying Bone.

295
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:06,512
However, ordinary demons can't even get close to it.

296
00:25:06,759 --> 00:25:11,832
If so, I suppose this task was designed for me in mind.

297
00:25:12,160 --> 00:25:14,193
As long as I approach it in my human form during the day,

298
00:25:14,497 --> 00:25:16,174
I can acquire the Lightning Wood.

299
00:25:16,255 --> 00:25:17,768
But you have no powers during the day.

300
00:25:18,279 --> 00:25:20,032
It's too risky for you to head to the western outskirts alone.

301
00:25:20,799 --> 00:25:21,814
Why don't we...

302
00:25:22,599 --> 00:25:24,913
It's just a trip to the mountains. It's not that dangerous.

303
00:25:25,000 --> 00:25:27,913
Zhen, I'll head there and retrieve the Lightning Wood tomorrow.

304
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:34,873
Young Master, are you sure you want to go there?

305
00:25:35,359 --> 00:25:37,393
But people say that the western outskirts are haunted.

306
00:25:37,579 --> 00:25:38,931
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

307
00:25:39,880 --> 00:25:42,072
The Arcane Appraisal Bureau is a bunch of cowards.

308
00:25:42,400 --> 00:25:43,673
All of them were terrified.

309
00:25:43,877 --> 00:25:45,350
None of them wanted to join you.

310
00:25:45,504 --> 00:25:47,618
I was the one who wanted to head there alone. You shouldn't blame them.

311
00:25:52,599 --> 00:25:53,953
How much money do we have left?

312
00:25:56,759 --> 00:25:58,552
Roughly 30 strings of cash.

313
00:26:00,727 --> 00:26:01,845
All right.

314
00:26:04,759 --> 00:26:06,879
Young Master, do you intend to prepare a betrothal gift

315
00:26:06,959 --> 00:26:08,752
and ask for Princess Qing He's hands?

316
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,382
You look so happy.

317
00:26:12,920 --> 00:26:14,592
I thought you disliked Lady Wu Zhen in the past.

318
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,993
I suppose I understood her nature after all this time.

319
00:26:18,078 --> 00:26:21,636
Although she's known as a frivolous noble, she doesn't have a short temper.

320
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:24,480
She even appreciated my cooking. She's quite easy to serve.

321
00:26:25,119 --> 00:26:28,193
Most importantly, you're poor while she's wealthy.

322
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:30,968
You two are a match made in Heaven.

323
00:26:33,303 --> 00:26:35,153
On my way here, I heard

324
00:26:36,013 --> 00:26:37,771
that the road in front of your home is a rough one.

325
00:26:37,960 --> 00:26:40,072
It's long, narrow, and muddy.

326
00:26:40,309 --> 00:26:41,687
Even carriages cannot get through.

327
00:26:41,880 --> 00:26:44,112
The carriage granted by His Majesty is quite troublesome.

328
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:45,993
It takes two horses to pull it.

329
00:26:46,759 --> 00:26:49,433
I knew that today was your day off. That's why I came here to see you.

330
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:53,913
I never expected the road outside your place to be in such poor condition.

331
00:26:54,519 --> 00:26:57,433
On my way here, I sprained my ankle. My shoes are dirty as well.

332
00:26:57,983 --> 00:26:59,309
What should we do about it?

333
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,272
The road in front of our residence is muddy and uneven. It's inconvenient.

334
00:27:07,511 --> 00:27:10,105
I advanced some of my monthly salary from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

335
00:27:10,864 --> 00:27:13,056
Find someone to have it repaired in the next couple of days.

336
00:27:14,440 --> 00:27:17,797
You've been saving up all this just so you could repair the road, huh?

337
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:20,393
Also, dismantle this shed.

338
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,688
The shed?

339
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,248
What's wrong with the donkey's shed?

340
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,904
Where will Fu Gui stay if we dismantle it?

341
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,233
Relocate it to somewhere else.

342
00:27:29,880 --> 00:27:32,352
The path is too narrow. Carriages cannot get through.

343
00:27:32,759 --> 00:27:35,512
Even so, you don't need to dismantle the shed, do you?

344
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:39,112
We have a small carriage. It can make it through with a bit of squeezing.

345
00:27:39,326 --> 00:27:40,434
Just dismantle it.

346
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,352
After all, not all carriages

347
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:45,792
are as tiny and exquisite as ours.

348
00:27:48,984 --> 00:27:50,051
But...

349
00:28:00,305 --> 00:28:01,899
Stop eating. Let's go.

350
00:28:07,839 --> 00:28:09,792
Let's go.

351
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:16,592
- Let's go.   - Let's go.

352
00:28:24,160 --> 00:28:25,752
Sister sent you two here, didn't she?

353
00:28:39,720 --> 00:28:41,599
- Huai'an, Lin Yuan.   - Yes, Your Highness.

354
00:28:42,104 --> 00:28:43,168
Greetings, Your Highness.

355
00:28:46,359 --> 00:28:48,552
I'm sure Ming Zhuang reported my movements to the palace again.

356
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,312
This isn't my first time going on a trip outside of the palace.

357
00:28:53,519 --> 00:28:55,153
Why did Sister send you two here?

358
00:28:55,652 --> 00:28:57,686
Your Highness, it hasn't been very peaceful outside the city these days

359
00:28:57,936 --> 00:29:01,673
Her Majesty knew that you were stubborn and you wouldn't change your mind.

360
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,913
That's why she sent us here to protect you.

361
00:29:04,079 --> 00:29:06,608
Your Highness, please pardon us. Please don't make things difficult for us.

362
00:29:06,767 --> 00:29:08,604
You guys are making things difficult for me.

363
00:29:08,759 --> 00:29:09,913
Your Highness, what did you say?

364
00:29:10,200 --> 00:29:13,153
I said, you guys are obstructing my steed.

365
00:29:17,119 --> 00:29:19,716
Dear! Please wake up!

366
00:29:19,799 --> 00:29:24,393
Dear, please wake up!

367
00:29:24,920 --> 00:29:27,673
Sir, please save us!

368
00:29:28,227 --> 00:29:29,938
He San hasn't recovered from his condition yet,

369
00:29:30,018 --> 00:29:31,384
but two more people fell unconscious today.

370
00:29:31,559 --> 00:29:33,233
And, they're the strongest men in the village as well.

371
00:29:34,000 --> 00:29:35,103
That's right.

372
00:29:36,039 --> 00:29:39,112
Sir, may I know how your superiors intend to deal with this?

373
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,953
We make a living by gathering firewood and hunting.

374
00:29:43,079 --> 00:29:45,473
Now, no one dares to enter the mountains.

375
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,873
How can we survive in the future?

376
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,393
- Yeah.   - There's no way we can survive.

377
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:54,112
I'll surely give you guys an answer after my investigation.

378
00:29:54,440 --> 00:29:55,713
You should stop joking around.

379
00:29:56,505 --> 00:29:57,791
You look feeble to me.

380
00:29:58,079 --> 00:30:00,633
- Are you heading inside yourself?   - Someone must've instigated him.

381
00:30:00,839 --> 00:30:03,393
I suppose he has no idea how dangerous it is.

382
00:30:04,319 --> 00:30:05,873
I don't think you can make it out alive.

383
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:12,433
Yeah! Are the local authorities leaving us in the lurch here?

384
00:30:19,839 --> 00:30:22,112
Who said the local authorities only sent him here?

385
00:30:25,351 --> 00:30:26,493
Who are you?

386
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:29,759
I'm Wu Zhen, Princess Qing He of Duke Wu's Residence.

387
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:33,473
I'm here to assist Keeper Mei in his investigation.

388
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,673
Princess Qing He? I think she's Her Majesty's younger sister.

389
00:30:37,309 --> 00:30:39,996
- She's from the imperial family, then.   - That's right.

390
00:30:40,079 --> 00:30:43,312
What's the point of sending a county princess here?

391
00:30:43,519 --> 00:30:47,112
Her status is the only thing noble about her. She's still a weak girl.

392
00:30:48,599 --> 00:30:50,153
So what if I'm a weak girl?

393
00:30:50,279 --> 00:30:53,077
By rank, the county princess is of Second Grade,

394
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,393
which is above many young lords in power and status.

395
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,917
As for fighting ability, Xu San Lang from the Chang'an Garrison,

396
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:01,112
General Zhang, Commandant of the Upper Prefecture,

397
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,153
Lord Gu, Central Colonel of the Imperial Guards,

398
00:31:03,599 --> 00:31:04,956
and Captain Huang of the City Patrol...

399
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:06,393
Who are they?

400
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:08,752
All of them lost to me.

401
00:31:10,519 --> 00:31:12,752
Yeah. Who are they? I've never heard of them.

402
00:31:13,039 --> 00:31:16,512
They do sound like important figures.

403
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,317
I suppose they're powerful.

404
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,997
- I think she's lying.   - They should be quite powerful.

405
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:24,352
By the way, there are two Jinwu Guards here.

406
00:31:25,279 --> 00:31:27,597
His Majesty and Her Majesty sent them here to protect me.

407
00:31:27,680 --> 00:31:30,552
Later, they'll summon renowned physicians for you all.

408
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:33,752
If you don't believe me, you may inspect their waist pass.

409
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,072
- Why don't we take a look?   - Let's go.

410
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:38,839
- Take a look.   - Are they real?

411
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:41,752
- It's real!   - The waist pass is real!

412
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:43,473
They're genuine Jinwu Guards!

413
00:31:43,839 --> 00:31:45,792
- Really?   - They're Jinwu Guards!

414
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:49,473
Thank you, Your Majesty.

415
00:31:50,759 --> 00:31:53,153
We're merely here to provide aid.

416
00:31:53,480 --> 00:31:56,913
We're inferior compared to Keeper Mei.

417
00:31:57,240 --> 00:31:58,302
But...

418
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:01,272
This official looks feeble and weak.

419
00:32:01,599 --> 00:32:02,713
So what?

420
00:32:04,842 --> 00:32:07,994
We may be good at martial arts, but we cannot solve cases.

421
00:32:08,220 --> 00:32:09,852
Keeper Mei is different.

422
00:32:10,065 --> 00:32:11,822
Keeper Mei was originally a civil official.

423
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:13,837
He's a man of vast reading and broad vision.

424
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,072
He's very knowledgeable.

425
00:32:16,920 --> 00:32:20,516
I'm sure he can solve the case in the western outskirts.

426
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:23,877
If that's the case, I'm glad to hear that.

427
00:32:23,960 --> 00:32:27,433
Keeper Shi, when you heard about the bizarre cases here,

428
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:31,592
you hastened your steps despite your frail frame

429
00:32:31,799 --> 00:32:33,673
just so you could visit the victims.

430
00:32:34,920 --> 00:32:36,873
We're very impressed.

431
00:32:42,799 --> 00:32:46,117
Sir, you must be careful when you enter the mountains.

432
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,917
- That's right.   - Please be careful.

433
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,098
Thank you so much.

434
00:32:53,640 --> 00:32:56,713
If Sister asks you guys about it, just tell her

435
00:32:57,311 --> 00:32:59,584
that Mr. Mei has a weak constitution.

436
00:32:59,839 --> 00:33:02,352
Tell her that I can't bear to let him enter the mountains alone.

437
00:33:07,039 --> 00:33:10,873
Keeper Mei, I hope you won't burn your bridges.

438
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:32,873
Thank you for serving as the vanguard.

439
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:36,557
Lady Wu, I should thank you for coming to my aid just now.

440
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,953
If so, you should remember that you owe me a favor.

441
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:42,792
So, Lady Wu, why did you come to the western outskirts?

442
00:33:44,839 --> 00:33:48,032
I said it already. I was concerned about your safety.

443
00:33:48,599 --> 00:33:50,233
You have a weak constitution.

444
00:33:50,960 --> 00:33:53,913
I'm afraid you'll fall unconscious in less than two hours.

445
00:33:54,519 --> 00:33:58,873
By then, I'll have to rescue you with my bubbly nature.

446
00:34:00,759 --> 00:34:02,473
I thought you would chase me away.

447
00:34:05,039 --> 00:34:06,312
I was intending to do so.

448
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,433
But you did me a favor. I can't think of an excuse to send you away.

449
00:34:11,440 --> 00:34:14,793
I suppose I was lucky to shut you up with my aid.

450
00:34:15,848 --> 00:34:19,766
Just now, you said all those figures lost to you. Is that true?

451
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,112
Naturally.

452
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:24,632
I fought all of them. None of them could defeat me.

453
00:34:25,274 --> 00:34:27,506
But why? Have they offended you in any way?

454
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:30,273
That's not it. It was a blind date.

455
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:33,273
None of them was skillful enough for me.

456
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:35,480
I see.

457
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:38,632
But Lady Wu, why didn't you care about my skills, then?

458
00:34:38,840 --> 00:34:41,632
Mr. Mei, you won with your good looks.

459
00:34:42,360 --> 00:34:43,873
There's no need to compete with them.

460
00:34:44,960 --> 00:34:46,016
Thank you.

461
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:49,833
Don't worry.

462
00:34:50,519 --> 00:34:53,873
Now that I'm here, the journey will surely be smooth.

463
00:34:58,679 --> 00:35:02,273
Lord Shu, it's been days since I saw Qi Shi.

464
00:35:03,336 --> 00:35:05,052
I sent my men out to look for him.

465
00:35:05,147 --> 00:35:07,980
Even so, they found no traces of the rat demon you mentioned.

466
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:11,273
Elder Gray, why don't you ask the ward leaders under you again?

467
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:14,152
Or you should search your sect again

468
00:35:14,599 --> 00:35:16,152
to see if there are any other leads.

469
00:35:16,559 --> 00:35:20,953
Lord Shu, are you sure you've searched everywhere?

470
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:22,389
Elder Gray.

471
00:35:23,463 --> 00:35:25,541
The Demon Market consists of the Four Sects and the Eight Wards.

472
00:35:25,657 --> 00:35:27,730
The affairs of each ward should be handled by the ward leader.

473
00:35:27,836 --> 00:35:30,952
If a decision cannot be made, the elders of the Four Sects will take over.

474
00:35:31,111 --> 00:35:33,584
If a decision cannot be made after that, the Two Lords will take over.

475
00:35:34,259 --> 00:35:37,172
I'm helping you out on account of our ties.

476
00:35:37,623 --> 00:35:39,536
I haven't held you accountable for your negligence.

477
00:35:40,039 --> 00:35:41,993
But you're being so aggressive here.

478
00:35:42,719 --> 00:35:44,313
I don't think that's appropriate.

479
00:35:44,719 --> 00:35:48,072
Lord Shu, I dare not offend you.

480
00:35:48,559 --> 00:35:51,156
However, there are missing demons in the Demon Market.

481
00:35:51,239 --> 00:35:53,632
I truly cannot shoulder this responsibility.

482
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,393
It seems that we have to seek the help of Cat Lord

483
00:35:56,639 --> 00:35:57,917
and allow her to make the call here.

484
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:01,353
Elder Gray, are you saying that I'm not good enough to do so?

485
00:36:01,800 --> 00:36:04,433
Lord Shu, why do you say so?

486
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:07,793
You and I cannot do anything about it.

487
00:36:08,119 --> 00:36:11,313
Shouldn't we report this case to the Two Lords as per the rules?

488
00:36:13,382 --> 00:36:17,696
Cat Lord is busy with official affairs. There's no need to trouble her.

489
00:36:19,638 --> 00:36:24,511
I shall look for Qi Shi on your behalf personally.

490
00:36:25,519 --> 00:36:27,393
Thank you, Lord Shu.

491
00:36:29,773 --> 00:36:32,683
You and Cat Lord have been friends for many years.

492
00:36:32,763 --> 00:36:34,289
You two grew up together.

493
00:36:34,447 --> 00:36:36,413
You guided her in the ways of the demon arts

494
00:36:36,493 --> 00:36:37,869
and aided her in governing the Demon Market.

495
00:36:37,990 --> 00:36:39,944
Naturally, your bond with her is different.

496
00:36:40,440 --> 00:36:44,273
However, Lord Shu, here's a piece of advice.

497
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:47,913
The Demon Market belongs to the demons

498
00:36:48,159 --> 00:36:50,677
while Cat Lord is a half-demon.

499
00:36:50,836 --> 00:36:52,549
You've always been wise.

500
00:36:53,239 --> 00:36:55,672
You shouldn't let your loyalty jeopardize your future.

501
00:36:58,719 --> 00:37:00,313
Thank you for the reminder.

502
00:37:01,039 --> 00:37:02,215
Farewell.

503
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:39,632
Initially, I thought of ending your life after a little longer.

504
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:42,353
This way, you can enjoy your life in the furnace.

505
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:45,913
But Elder Gray was being so aggressive.

506
00:37:47,159 --> 00:37:48,793
You shouldn't blame me for this.

507
00:37:50,280 --> 00:37:55,112
You really shouldn’t have tried to fish out information from Ling Xiao

508
00:37:55,599 --> 00:37:57,393
and cause trouble for Zhen.

509
00:37:57,486 --> 00:37:59,920
However, I'll grant you a happy ending.

510
00:38:00,405 --> 00:38:01,600
I'll turn you into a demon core

511
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:03,560
so that you can help with Cat Lord's demonic transformation.

512
00:38:03,983 --> 00:38:06,777
I suppose it's a worthy ending for you.

513
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,192
Don't kill me!

514
00:38:11,880 --> 00:38:13,032
Don't kill me!

515
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:18,313
I don't want to die!

516
00:38:45,534 --> 00:38:48,096
Who would have thought

517
00:38:48,221 --> 00:38:49,760
that the flowers would be blooming on this wild mountain trail?

518
00:38:49,888 --> 00:38:52,600
We came at the right time.

519
00:38:55,072 --> 00:38:56,126
Mr. Mei.

520
00:39:23,031 --> 00:39:24,115
Isn't it beautiful?

521
00:39:25,209 --> 00:39:26,237
It is.

522
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:30,400
Let's go.

523
00:39:41,798 --> 00:39:43,791
Do you know what that is?

524
00:39:47,719 --> 00:39:50,753
Back in Quzhou, I once encountered a similar miasma.

525
00:39:51,880 --> 00:39:53,592
(He's an ignorant mortal indeed.)

526
00:39:54,186 --> 00:39:57,700
(This miasma manifests in the form of a mist. It's already sentient.)

527
00:39:58,320 --> 00:39:59,512
(It must be the work of Mountain Specter.)

528
00:39:59,942 --> 00:40:03,095
Most people pay no mind to such miasma.

529
00:40:03,360 --> 00:40:05,833
But once they inhale it, they'll fall sick.

530
00:40:06,880 --> 00:40:09,753
- Seems like...   - Seems like this is what your bureau is looking for.

531
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,480
When I was in Quzhou, I heard

532
00:40:13,956 --> 00:40:17,028
that one has to find the source to get rid of the miasma.

533
00:40:17,199 --> 00:40:18,640
Destroy the source, and the miasma will disperse.

534
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:22,053
Mr. Mei, you did learn a lot when you were in Quzhou.

535
00:40:22,589 --> 00:40:24,501
Lady Wu, I'm afraid it'll be dangerous up ahead.

536
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:26,552
- You...   - I still have you with me.

537
00:40:32,516 --> 00:40:35,429
Since the miasma is bad for us, we just need to cover our noses.

538
00:41:00,599 --> 00:41:01,602
Let's head in that direction.

539
00:41:28,199 --> 00:41:31,357
Although the fog is thick here, we're lucky that it isn't the miasma.

540
00:41:31,440 --> 00:41:35,393
But Mr. Mei, why didn't you ask me why I chose this path?

541
00:41:35,840 --> 00:41:38,156
Lady Wu, you were too quick. I had no time to ask you.

542
00:41:38,239 --> 00:41:40,112
Why aren't you asking me about it now?

543
00:41:40,599 --> 00:41:42,433
Since we're already here, it's pointless to ask.

544
00:41:43,159 --> 00:41:44,672
I can't just leave you alone.

545
00:41:44,920 --> 00:41:48,753
Moreover, this path might lead us to the source of the miasma.

546
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:52,552
I just thought that the view here was gorgeous.

547
00:41:52,879 --> 00:41:54,796
I didn't expect you to be this subservient.

548
00:41:54,932 --> 00:41:56,445
This path is difficult to traverse. Be careful.

549
00:41:59,186 --> 00:42:00,381
You didn't sprain your ankle, did you?

550
00:42:03,168 --> 00:42:04,480
What a jinx.

551
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:08,922
Get on my back.
