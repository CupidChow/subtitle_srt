00:01:27,228 --> 00:01:30,976
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,089 --> 00:01:33,960
(Episode 24)

3
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:36,980
About that offer you made to walk the same path,

4
00:01:37,881 --> 00:01:39,376
we can try it now.

5
00:01:40,416 --> 00:01:43,080
No wonder the Undecaying Bone came after you.

6
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,840
You've regained your memories and your true form.

7
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:48,240
Just what is your connection to Sinister Lord Infant?

8
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,200
That's none of your concern.

9
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,179
Lord Shu, what is it you really want from me?

10
00:01:56,359 --> 00:01:57,960
You are a millennia-old demon.

11
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,960
You have knowledge of many past events.

12
00:02:00,599 --> 00:02:02,680
I trust you can be of use to me.

13
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:06,000
Aren't you afraid I'll lie to you?

14
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:08,296
If you're foolish enough to try,

15
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,760
I can always turn you back into a rat.

16
00:02:11,719 --> 00:02:12,719
Haven't you had

17
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:14,896
your fill of gutter scraps?

18
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,377
I wouldn't dare.

19
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:21,960
I'll obey your every command, Lord Shu.

20
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:24,215
The Sinister Infant's core.

21
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:27,455
Find it and bring it back to me.

22
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:37,136
The Sinister Infant's core...

23
00:02:38,320 --> 00:02:40,175
Such is the virtue of the consort.

24
00:02:40,520 --> 00:02:42,095
It is the origin of the state airs.

25
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,960
It guides the world and corrects marital bonds.

26
00:03:36,199 --> 00:03:37,736
I'm a butterfly!

27
00:03:40,039 --> 00:03:41,975
- Has he lost his mind? - I'm a butterfly!

28
00:03:55,199 --> 00:03:56,199
Isn't he cold?

29
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:01,535
What's wrong with him?

30
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:43,800
My dear!

31
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:47,640
What's wrong with you?

32
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:48,783
Stop moving!

33
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Stop moving!

34
00:04:50,439 --> 00:04:51,815
Please stop this, my dear!

35
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:26,216
What did I catch?

36
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:35,120
Oh heavens!

37
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:38,623
Heavens!

38
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:48,935
I caught a giant goldfish!

39
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,656
A goldfish!

40
00:05:53,678 --> 00:05:55,678
(Arcane Appraisal Bureau)

41
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,216
This is so bizarre.

42
00:05:57,399 --> 00:06:00,536
Seriously, what's gotten into people lately?

43
00:06:01,279 --> 00:06:04,096
Turn your back for a moment and they're all acting crazy.

44
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,533
Like they say,

45
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:09,553
what you dwell on by day, you dream at night.

46
00:06:10,199 --> 00:06:12,879
When life's not going your way,

47
00:06:12,959 --> 00:06:15,895
dreams become your outlet.

48
00:06:16,079 --> 00:06:19,253
Some people clearly get a little carried away in their sleep.

49
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,160
Be serious.

50
00:06:23,999 --> 00:06:26,680
Even so, this is far too strange.

51
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:28,736
Dreaming is one thing,

52
00:06:29,346 --> 00:06:30,880
but sleepwalking and causing trouble?

53
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:33,960
It's like some kind of contagious madness.

54
00:06:34,546 --> 00:06:35,546
Sleepwalking?

55
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:40,119
Don't overthink it, Commissioner Mei.

56
00:06:40,760 --> 00:06:42,560
Your wedding tomorrow is what really matters.

57
00:06:43,519 --> 00:06:44,920
That's right.

58
00:06:46,480 --> 00:06:48,280
Finally, another demon.

59
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:06,015
It's your wedding tomorrow, my lord.

60
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,480
What brings you here tonight?

61
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:15,560
There's been another demon causing trouble in the city.

62
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:17,176
I'm here to investigate its origins.

63
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:23,240
Then you have come in vain.

64
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:25,840
- How so? - The demon you're looking for

65
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,416
isn't recorded in the Demon City archives.

66
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:30,586
Judging by its actions,

67
00:07:31,326 --> 00:07:33,022
it must have only recently taken shape.

68
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:38,499
Zhen.

69
00:07:39,600 --> 00:07:40,760
If you needed to find a book,

70
00:07:41,879 --> 00:07:43,375
why didn't you just come ask me?

71
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,057
I just assumed you must be busy with the affairs of the Gray Sect.

72
00:07:48,485 --> 00:07:49,645
I didn't want to disturb you.

73
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:06,520
Didn't you say these were rare, irreplaceable volumes

74
00:08:06,600 --> 00:08:07,600
that must be protected?

75
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:10,240
- Why did you... - So what if they are rare and irreplaceable?

76
00:08:10,320 --> 00:08:13,000
If they're useless to you, they're nothing but junk.

77
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:22,639
Shu.

78
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:25,616
I'm about to be married.

79
00:08:27,519 --> 00:08:29,335
You need to have your own life too.

80
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:30,783
I only have you.

81
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:34,575
You don't have to like me.

82
00:08:36,960 --> 00:08:38,335
But don't stop needing me.

83
00:08:39,759 --> 00:08:41,599
The Demon City will always need you, Lord Shu.

84
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:43,903
That's not the same.

85
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:52,496
The Demon City's Lord Shu...

86
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:56,080
Will separate his duties from his personal feelings.

87
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,040
I will continue to fulfill my responsibilities.

88
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,256
You need not worry, my lord.

89
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:04,176
As for everything else...

90
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:08,776
I will manage it on my own.

91
00:09:09,679 --> 00:09:10,776
Good.

92
00:09:12,559 --> 00:09:14,095
After all, for 18 years,

93
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:18,000
no one has understood me like you have.

94
00:09:31,559 --> 00:09:34,400
She's a woman you can never have.

95
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,576
She will never be yours.

96
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:40,960
She doesn't belong to you!

97
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,855
In your state,

98
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:52,735
you're in no position to lecture me.

99
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:01,536
Oh no, I'm not going to make it!

100
00:10:32,680 --> 00:10:37,000
(Duke Wu's Manor)

101
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:44,536
It's quite a party.

102
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,280
She's still in bed? Wake her up now.

103
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,250
Young Lady?

104
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:00,143
Young Lady.

105
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,120
Young Lady.

106
00:11:05,919 --> 00:11:08,120
Zhen, wake up!

107
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,096
It's your wedding day!

108
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,416
It's my wedding, not yours.

109
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:14,920
Why are you getting so worked up?

110
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,920
Listen to yourself!

111
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:20,040
Always spouting nonsense with no sense of propriety.

112
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:21,696
It's your wedding!

113
00:11:21,919 --> 00:11:25,040
Young Lady, what bride acts like you?

114
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:27,400
Dragging your feet on your own wedding day.

115
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:29,056
That's right.

116
00:11:30,200 --> 00:11:32,056
Get her out of bed to get ready immediately.

117
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,536
I-I'll go take care of things outside!

118
00:11:34,679 --> 00:11:36,056
Yes, Your Grace.

119
00:11:37,679 --> 00:11:39,879
- Young Lady... - Hey! That's not the right way!

120
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,000
Come here.

121
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,863
The moment the groom enters, we strike!

122
00:12:02,106 --> 00:12:04,840
We have to give Little Fish a good hazing!

123
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:06,160
Haze him!

124
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,680
But isn't Zhu Yu your cousin?

125
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,879
Oh, right.

126
00:12:14,640 --> 00:12:15,920
So what?

127
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:17,806
Even though Little Fish is my cousin,

128
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,319
I grew up with Zhen.

129
00:12:20,399 --> 00:12:21,575
We're much closer.

130
00:12:22,360 --> 00:12:23,615
So Zhen takes priority.

131
00:12:25,240 --> 00:12:26,240
Still...

132
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:27,760
Shouldn't we technically

133
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,575
be on Commissioner Mei's side?

134
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:33,360
Let's go.

135
00:12:33,640 --> 00:12:34,640
Wait!

136
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:38,241
You may be Commissioner Mei's men,

137
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,200
but he belongs to Zhen.

138
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,120
Which means you're all hers anyway.

139
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:50,136
So listen up, we must give it our all and stand united!

140
00:12:50,360 --> 00:12:52,160
We cannot let Little Fish push Zhen around.

141
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:23,046
The groom has arrived!

142
00:14:48,978 --> 00:14:50,995
Little Fish, why aren't you dodging?

143
00:14:54,559 --> 00:14:55,800
What is the meaning of this?

144
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,056
It's tradition. You're supposed to just take the beating.

145
00:15:03,173 --> 00:15:05,428
Do me a favor, just play along.

146
00:15:06,480 --> 00:15:07,615
I see.

147
00:15:08,639 --> 00:15:09,639
Go ahead then.

148
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,280
Why do I feel insulted?

149
00:15:13,639 --> 00:15:14,639
Hit him!

150
00:15:15,080 --> 00:15:16,143
Don't you dare.

151
00:16:14,679 --> 00:16:15,679
Look.

152
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:00,935
She looks so pretty.

153
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:22,680
What are they doing?

154
00:17:24,520 --> 00:17:26,137
They're waiting for the flower-pinning.

155
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,416
How do you not know this?

156
00:17:27,799 --> 00:17:29,095
I've never been married.

157
00:17:30,520 --> 00:17:31,587
On the wedding day,

158
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:33,599
the bride's closest friend

159
00:17:33,680 --> 00:17:36,000
must help with the final step of the ceremony

160
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,136
by pinning flower on the bride's robe

161
00:17:38,319 --> 00:17:39,593
to symbolize their blessings.

162
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:40,783
Hold on.

163
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:43,897
Does Wu Zhen even have any close friends besides us?

164
00:17:44,079 --> 00:17:45,079
And a female one at that?

165
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,266
None of the noble young ladies

166
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,120
want to be associated with Princess Qing He.

167
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,416
Are you really going to jeopardize your own reputation

168
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:06,655
just to help her?

169
00:18:19,119 --> 00:18:20,119
But...

170
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:22,503
She saved my life.

171
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:36,895
Lady Liu...

172
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:02,840
We have been at odds since we were children.

173
00:19:03,480 --> 00:19:04,936
After all these years of fighting,

174
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:07,216
let the past be the past.

175
00:19:08,520 --> 00:19:11,177
Since someone was brave enough to actually marry you,

176
00:19:11,805 --> 00:19:13,525
I had to come and offer my congratulations.

177
00:19:18,720 --> 00:19:19,743
I knew it.

178
00:19:28,480 --> 00:19:29,696
This is a joyous occasion.

179
00:19:30,039 --> 00:19:33,175
We from the Ruyi Pavilion had to come to share in your happiness.

180
00:19:34,359 --> 00:19:36,615
Let us continue, Your Highness.

181
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:40,483
Lay the mats!

182
00:19:42,440 --> 00:19:44,135
Pass the mats, lay the bags!

183
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:47,575
May your lineage carry on for generations!

184
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:51,496
May this union last forever!

185
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,120
May your household prosper for eternity!

186
00:19:55,240 --> 00:19:58,400
Scatter the grains! Ward off misfortune!

187
00:19:58,799 --> 00:19:59,895
First scattering!

188
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:04,255
May your union be harmonious and your love everlasting.

189
00:20:04,599 --> 00:20:05,696
Second scattering!

190
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:08,056
May your bond be strong and inseparable!

191
00:20:08,520 --> 00:20:09,937
Step over the saddle!

192
00:20:15,359 --> 00:20:18,855
May peace be sent with the seasons, for all the years to come!

193
00:20:19,040 --> 00:20:22,457
The auspicious hour has come. Let the bride and groom enter!

194
00:20:57,106 --> 00:20:58,561
First bow.

195
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:07,976
Second bow.

196
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:15,656
Third bow.

197
00:21:21,079 --> 00:21:22,840
Bind their hair.

198
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:54,479
Bound by hair, now husband and wife,

199
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:56,216
in love and trust, for all of life.

200
00:22:01,839 --> 00:22:03,175
Rise.

201
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,740
First bow.

202
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:33,840
Second bow.

203
00:22:41,599 --> 00:22:43,375
When did you start falling for him?

204
00:22:43,839 --> 00:22:46,519
Maybe it was when he said a woman's worth

205
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:48,016
isn't defined by marriage.

206
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:49,976
Or maybe

207
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,177
it was when he understood me,

208
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:55,040
accepted me, no matter how I defied convention,

209
00:22:55,319 --> 00:22:56,655
and even indulge my mischief.

210
00:23:02,920 --> 00:23:04,016
What's so funny?

211
00:23:04,440 --> 00:23:05,440
Nothing.

212
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,360
It's just...

213
00:23:08,240 --> 00:23:09,536
Everything feels good.

214
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:12,697
In the Demon City,

215
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:15,016
I'm a half-demon freak.

216
00:23:15,732 --> 00:23:17,028
In the mortal realm,

217
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,440
I'm a scandalous troublemaker.

218
00:23:20,272 --> 00:23:21,649
Only with him...

219
00:23:23,272 --> 00:23:24,295
I'm just Wu Zhen.

220
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:26,256
I don't need to explain myself

221
00:23:26,853 --> 00:23:28,149
or change myself.

222
00:23:29,066 --> 00:23:30,066
Kitty,

223
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:32,415
I only hope you won't end up like me,

224
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,976
all for nothing in the end.

225
00:23:35,480 --> 00:23:37,016
I love him now.

226
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,246
I don't want to waste time worrying about the future.

227
00:23:41,079 --> 00:23:43,953
Even if one day we do grow sick of each other,

228
00:23:44,259 --> 00:23:45,555
I'll accept that.

229
00:23:52,799 --> 00:23:54,200
Third bow.

230
00:23:55,359 --> 00:23:57,655
He's such a bright, untainted young man.

231
00:23:58,079 --> 00:23:59,696
It's only natural I'm drawn to him.

232
00:24:00,599 --> 00:24:02,655
But his life has been so lonely.

233
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,655
I asked you to look after him

234
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,016
just to bring him some warmth.

235
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,375
Seeing you again in Chang'an,

236
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:13,257
I noticed you've changed.

237
00:24:14,839 --> 00:24:16,016
Perhaps it's because...

238
00:24:18,160 --> 00:24:19,456
The nights were too cold.

239
00:24:21,359 --> 00:24:23,359
And I found myself longing for a ray of light now.

240
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:29,814
I beg for your approval, seniors.

241
00:24:30,087 --> 00:24:32,240
Grant me permission to marry her

242
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:34,120
and be with her for a lifetime.

243
00:24:34,600 --> 00:24:36,095
According to the rules of Changxi Palace,

244
00:24:36,119 --> 00:24:38,256
any disciple who wishes to leave

245
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:40,095
must pass through the White Night Array

246
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:42,895
and endure the White Night Bird's piercing.

247
00:24:44,005 --> 00:24:45,621
What's so special about that vixen?

248
00:24:46,079 --> 00:24:47,895
Is she really worth all this sacrifice?

249
00:24:48,039 --> 00:24:49,063
She is.

250
00:24:51,519 --> 00:24:52,519
I once believed

251
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,655
my only purpose in life was to uncover the truth of the past,

252
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:57,520
to slay demons and banish evil.

253
00:24:58,520 --> 00:24:59,816
But then I met her.

254
00:25:01,786 --> 00:25:02,786
And for the first time,

255
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,897
I began to crave the future.

256
00:25:05,140 --> 00:25:06,203
I found desire.

257
00:25:06,599 --> 00:25:07,855
It's our desires

258
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:10,415
that make life rich and full.

259
00:25:10,725 --> 00:25:11,788
Young Master,

260
00:25:12,799 --> 00:25:13,999
whatever it is you want to do,

261
00:25:14,673 --> 00:25:15,673
go ahead and do it.

262
00:25:16,599 --> 00:25:17,599
So I believe

263
00:25:18,520 --> 00:25:19,816
she's worth everything.

264
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,135
Share the nuptial wine!

265
00:25:50,039 --> 00:25:52,135
Drinking as one beneath the spring moon,

266
00:25:52,359 --> 00:25:54,815
may your home be blessed with joy and harmony ever after!

267
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:01,376
Bow to your guests!

268
00:26:08,799 --> 00:26:09,976
Rest assured,

269
00:26:10,640 --> 00:26:13,080
matters of the Demon City must never be revealed to mortals.

270
00:26:13,200 --> 00:26:14,279
That is the rule.

271
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:15,422
As it has always been.

272
00:26:15,680 --> 00:26:17,136
Whatever experiences mortals go through,

273
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:18,679
I too wish to live through once,

274
00:26:18,759 --> 00:26:19,822
to feel it for myself.

275
00:26:20,759 --> 00:26:24,615
Slaying demons and banishing evil will always be my purpose.

276
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:26,725
But now,

277
00:26:27,799 --> 00:26:29,855
I have someone precious to protect.

278
00:26:30,079 --> 00:26:33,095
The ceremony is complete!

279
00:26:38,119 --> 00:26:39,176
May you be blessed with children!

280
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:41,640
- May you grow old together! - May your union last forever!

281
00:27:24,759 --> 00:27:25,759
What do you want?

282
00:27:26,359 --> 00:27:27,359
Lady Liu,

283
00:27:27,799 --> 00:27:28,799
what do you think

284
00:27:29,666 --> 00:27:31,106
will become of Zhen and Little Fish,

285
00:27:31,759 --> 00:27:34,375
with one human and one demon together?

286
00:27:35,480 --> 00:27:36,480
Actually...

287
00:27:38,519 --> 00:27:40,223
I almost married too once.

288
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:41,960
Once?

289
00:27:45,052 --> 00:27:46,052
Get married?

290
00:27:46,359 --> 00:27:47,719
Do you really think you're mortal?

291
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:49,063
Go to hell!

292
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,160
After that,

293
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:54,456
the former Serpent Lord found me.

294
00:27:56,039 --> 00:27:57,999
He brought me back to the Demon City to treat me.

295
00:27:58,200 --> 00:27:59,736
I swore to myself

296
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:02,680
that when I recovered,

297
00:28:03,759 --> 00:28:05,340
I'd return and kill him,

298
00:28:06,279 --> 00:28:07,615
to make him pay.

299
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:14,256
But I forgot something.

300
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:23,297
I thought he would be afraid,

301
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,382
terrified,

302
00:28:27,559 --> 00:28:28,582
full of regret.

303
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,920
But I forgot...

304
00:28:32,446 --> 00:28:34,080
The time it took me to heal,

305
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,775
for him,

306
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,176
was a lifetime.

307
00:28:40,839 --> 00:28:43,006
Demons can live for centuries.

308
00:28:44,600 --> 00:28:47,193
We've seen the cruelty and fickleness of this world.

309
00:28:48,519 --> 00:28:50,456
They say snakes are cold-blooded,

310
00:28:52,520 --> 00:28:54,520
but we're nothing compared to you mortals.

311
00:28:57,040 --> 00:28:58,040
You speak

312
00:28:58,680 --> 00:29:01,016
so sweetly of love,

313
00:29:01,785 --> 00:29:03,160
yet when you turn cold,

314
00:29:04,600 --> 00:29:06,480
you sever ties more ruthlessly than anyone.

315
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:10,657
I'm nothing like that man.

316
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,416
You can trust me.

317
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:16,400
The lifespans of mortals and demons are too different.

318
00:29:17,720 --> 00:29:19,016
It will never end well.

319
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:29,720
Come, come.

320
00:29:30,319 --> 00:29:31,319
Let's drink!

321
00:29:32,519 --> 00:29:33,696
If we were to fall in love,

322
00:29:34,926 --> 00:29:36,622
it would only end in tragedy.

323
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:41,800
I don't know what the future holds for Wu Zhen and Mei Zhu Yu.

324
00:29:43,520 --> 00:29:44,616
All I do know is

325
00:29:45,799 --> 00:29:47,826
she's young and reckless,

326
00:29:49,119 --> 00:29:51,536
determined to walk this difficult path no matter the cost.

327
00:29:53,720 --> 00:29:54,743
But you,

328
00:29:56,286 --> 00:29:58,567
you've only got a few decades of good years ahead of you.

329
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,840
Don't waste them on me.

330
00:30:10,680 --> 00:30:12,095
You don't need to worry about that.

331
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:15,703
I will love you

332
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,776
for as long as I live.

333
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:20,235
As long as I love you,

334
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:22,936
I will wish for your happiness.

335
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:27,855
When I die one day,

336
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:31,256
someone else will come along to care for you.

337
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:35,880
You have nothing to trouble yourself over.

338
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:44,920
Is it worth it?

339
00:30:49,672 --> 00:30:52,616
Whether it's worth it or not is for me to decide.

340
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,936
Why are you looking at me like that?

341
00:31:03,559 --> 00:31:05,496
Because you're beautiful, of course.

342
00:31:10,119 --> 00:31:11,575
It's Wu Zhen's wedding.

343
00:31:12,720 --> 00:31:14,736
The bride should be the most beautiful one.

344
00:31:16,759 --> 00:31:19,095
But if the day ever comes when you put on a wedding dress,

345
00:31:19,653 --> 00:31:21,389
I'd wager you'd outshine her.

346
00:31:33,079 --> 00:31:36,135
Lady Liu, I should go and help Little Fish out.

347
00:31:36,519 --> 00:31:37,519
At this rate,

348
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:40,440
he'll be too drunk for his wedding night.

349
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,656
I'm coming! I'll drink for him!

350
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:47,496
Come on!

351
00:31:48,640 --> 00:31:50,496
Drink with us, Commissioner Mei!

352
00:31:50,952 --> 00:31:51,952
Let me through!

353
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,239
- He's got important business later tonight! - Alright.

354
00:31:55,319 --> 00:31:57,199
- I'll drink for him! - Let me fill your cup!

355
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:00,920
Come on.

356
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,640
Drink!

357
00:32:19,840 --> 00:32:21,976
You don't have to keep staring at me like that, you know.

358
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:25,120
Young Lady, you must observe proper decorum on your wedding day.

359
00:32:25,640 --> 00:32:27,872
If you act out of turn, forget about what others will think,

360
00:32:27,896 --> 00:32:30,071
even your groom might think less of you.

361
00:32:30,319 --> 00:32:32,296
He wouldn't. Don't worry.

362
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,375
I might just become the first bride in Chang'an

363
00:32:38,559 --> 00:32:40,696
to pass out from sleep deprivation.

364
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:42,149
Well, that's because

365
00:32:42,279 --> 00:32:43,815
unlike every other bride in Chang'an,

366
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:45,960
you were not asleep in your bed on your wedding eve.

367
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:53,400
Cheers!

368
00:32:53,680 --> 00:32:55,496
Drink more!

369
00:32:57,079 --> 00:32:58,496
Where is Mei Si?

370
00:32:58,720 --> 00:33:00,120
He was puking his guts out earlier.

371
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:01,456
He's resting in the side room now.

372
00:33:01,480 --> 00:33:04,976
He kept snatching all the groom's wine for himself.

373
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,361
- Lady Liu? - Cheers!

374
00:34:36,441 --> 00:34:38,453
Lady Liu!

375
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,880
- You... - My dear!

376
00:34:39,961 --> 00:34:42,135
Mei Si, get up now!

377
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:44,440
Lady Liu,

378
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:46,250
I've loved you since I was young,

379
00:34:46,331 --> 00:34:47,907
more than ten years now.

380
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,255
You must have known it.

381
00:34:50,360 --> 00:34:52,135
So why did you keep avoiding me before?

382
00:34:53,079 --> 00:34:57,295
No matter. We're finally married now.

383
00:34:57,599 --> 00:35:00,073
Mei Si, have you had too much to drink?

384
00:35:00,346 --> 00:35:01,346
You're totally wasted.

385
00:35:03,400 --> 00:35:05,336
My dear, after all the trials we've been through,

386
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:06,640
at last we've made it.

387
00:35:07,165 --> 00:35:08,165
Come.

388
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:09,680
Time for important business.

389
00:35:09,840 --> 00:35:11,782
Mei Si, where are you taking her?

390
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:18,376
Enjoy yourselves, our dear guests.

391
00:35:19,025 --> 00:35:21,761
Your blessings are well received.

392
00:35:22,360 --> 00:35:24,080
Something's wrong. It's a demon.

393
00:35:24,559 --> 00:35:26,255
We have important business to do.

394
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,599
Lady Liu...

395
00:35:29,199 --> 00:35:30,199
Lady Liu!

396
00:35:31,178 --> 00:35:32,515
He's been possessed by a demon.

397
00:35:35,320 --> 00:35:37,655
I have to get him out of him.

398
00:35:45,926 --> 00:35:47,101
My dear...

399
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:12,843
Lady Liu really didn't hold back.

400
00:36:13,239 --> 00:36:14,880
Get someone to check on Mei Si.

401
00:36:14,986 --> 00:36:16,281
What if she's hurt him badly?

402
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:18,680
Young Lady!

403
00:36:20,639 --> 00:36:21,639
My dear?

404
00:36:22,679 --> 00:36:24,775
What is the bride doing on the roof?

405
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:28,175
Isn't that the bride?

406
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,880
What's wrong with her?

407
00:36:45,280 --> 00:36:47,600
Yes! I have power even during the day now.

408
00:36:48,360 --> 00:36:49,936
I've finally become a full demon.

409
00:37:22,012 --> 00:37:24,452
- Is Wu Zhen alright? - I won't let anything happen to her.

410
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:38,120
She's awake!

411
00:37:40,920 --> 00:37:41,920
Come.

412
00:37:47,600 --> 00:37:48,600
Do you feel unwell?

413
00:37:50,958 --> 00:37:52,200
You were right, Little Fish.

414
00:37:52,366 --> 00:37:54,800
You said Zhen would wake in an hour, and she really did.

415
00:37:58,920 --> 00:38:00,936
Why do you look upset?

416
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:04,256
You almost died just now! Of course he's upset! He...

417
00:38:04,880 --> 00:38:07,416
What on earth is going on with all of you?

418
00:38:09,000 --> 00:38:10,581
I had too much to drink, sir.

419
00:38:10,920 --> 00:38:13,840
When I woke up, I was already outside.

420
00:38:15,720 --> 00:38:17,240
I just had a dream.

421
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:21,503
Get some rest.

422
00:38:22,199 --> 00:38:24,215
The guests were quite startled earlier.

423
00:38:24,485 --> 00:38:25,485
I should go pacify them.

424
00:38:35,760 --> 00:38:39,039
His wife just woke up. How could he just leave her here?

425
00:38:39,119 --> 00:38:40,536
Father...

426
00:38:41,559 --> 00:38:42,559
Zhen,

427
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:44,896
are you still feeling unwell anywhere?

428
00:38:46,320 --> 00:38:49,976
I found a secret remedy at the local earth god's temple before.

429
00:38:50,199 --> 00:38:52,199
It is said to cure all manner of strange ailments.

430
00:38:52,333 --> 00:38:53,628
Do you want to try it?

431
00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,896
Please prepare a dose for Si too.

432
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:01,756
No problem!

433
00:39:02,400 --> 00:39:04,639
Wait here, both of you. I'll take care of it.

434
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:09,536
Zhen,

435
00:39:10,040 --> 00:39:11,857
did you really have to come up

436
00:39:11,938 --> 00:39:14,016
with such a ridiculous excuse to send Mister Wu away?

437
00:39:14,040 --> 00:39:15,176
I don't get it.

438
00:39:15,827 --> 00:39:18,096
It's understandable for a mortal like to me to get possessed,

439
00:39:18,120 --> 00:39:20,096
but you're the Cat Lord.

440
00:39:20,680 --> 00:39:21,977
The nerve of that demon

441
00:39:22,440 --> 00:39:24,856
to strike on my wedding.

442
00:39:26,032 --> 00:39:29,095
I have to make it pay for this.

443
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,735
A dream demon that should only appear quietly at night,

444
00:39:40,559 --> 00:39:42,359
somehow infiltrated dreams in broad daylight,

445
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:45,695
and in the middle of a crowded gathering, no less.

446
00:39:50,719 --> 00:39:52,496
This can't be a coincidence.

447
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:58,640
- What are you doing here? - Zhu Yu!

448
00:40:01,173 --> 00:40:02,296
When did you get to Chang'an?

449
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:03,320
I just got here.

450
00:40:03,440 --> 00:40:04,735
Did the sect leader send you?

451
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,655
Of course not. I sneaked out.

452
00:40:08,280 --> 00:40:10,680
You know me, I can't stand being cooped up in the mountains.

453
00:40:10,827 --> 00:40:13,242
Didn't expect I'd arrive right during your wedding though.

454
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:16,226
I was going to some buns to congratulate you,

455
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:20,493
but then I saw you rushing out of your residence.

456
00:40:21,300 --> 00:40:23,160
Zhu Yu, did you

457
00:40:23,773 --> 00:40:24,773
jilt your bride?

458
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:28,780
A demon disrupted the banquet today

459
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,056
and nearly killed my wife.

460
00:40:32,632 --> 00:40:34,000
Have you got any leads?

461
00:40:35,760 --> 00:40:38,566
This demon is cunning and elusive.

462
00:40:38,859 --> 00:40:40,475
It creeps into people's dreams,

463
00:40:40,800 --> 00:40:43,000
and compels them to manifest their dreams into reality,

464
00:40:43,052 --> 00:40:45,200
to act out whatever desire or obsession they have.

465
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:50,295
Sounds tricky to deal with.

466
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:51,840
Still manageable.

467
00:40:52,280 --> 00:40:53,575
Where are you going?

468
00:40:54,639 --> 00:40:56,702
- Find that demon. - I'm coming with you.

469
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:58,575
No talking too much.

470
00:40:58,960 --> 00:40:59,960
You got it.

471
00:41:00,320 --> 00:41:04,176
What kind of demon are we looking for?

472
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:09,976
A dream demon.

473
00:41:10,679 --> 00:41:13,400
This demon originally just enjoyed peeking into people's dreams,

474
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:17,720
but then discovered that true desires often reveal themselves in dreams.

475
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:20,735
So it began infiltrating dreams first,

476
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:22,615
then taking control through them.

477
00:41:24,719 --> 00:41:26,520
It feeds on the essence of dreams,

478
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:28,080
growing stronger each time.

479
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:30,135
For now it hasn't taken any lives,

480
00:41:30,800 --> 00:41:32,336
but that's only a matter of time.

481
00:41:32,480 --> 00:41:34,497
What's your plan?

482
00:41:35,679 --> 00:41:37,095
Bait him out.

483
00:41:37,679 --> 00:41:38,896
Follow the trail.

484
00:41:39,320 --> 00:41:40,736
This demon has succeeded repeatedly,

485
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:42,456
and now grows greedy and overconfident.

486
00:41:42,840 --> 00:41:44,816
It will surely show itself tonight.

487
00:41:45,960 --> 00:41:48,255
Since the dream demon loves dreams so much,

488
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:50,280
we'll make one for it.

489
00:41:50,840 --> 00:41:51,903
But where exactly

490
00:41:52,800 --> 00:41:54,016
do we build such a dream?

491
00:41:54,360 --> 00:41:55,695
All those attacked in their dreams

492
00:41:55,719 --> 00:41:57,679
were scattered across seven quarters of Chang'an.

493
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,775
The only sector with no incident so far is the southeast.

494
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:02,615
The southeast.

495
00:42:03,680 --> 00:42:05,696
There's an ideal place there.

496
00:42:06,480 --> 00:42:07,480
Tonight,

497
00:42:08,480 --> 00:42:11,056
I'll seize that demon and bring it back to Demon City.

498
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:17,000
One day,

499
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,856
I'll make sure Chang'an is free of demons

500
00:42:20,736 --> 00:42:22,231
for good.
