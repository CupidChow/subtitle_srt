00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:31,032
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,113 --> 00:01:34,000
(Episode 7)

3
00:02:11,567 --> 00:02:14,120
The Mountain Specter was killed by such a powerful magic.

4
00:02:15,039 --> 00:02:16,160
Who could have done this?

5
00:02:43,159 --> 00:02:45,553
To even dream of something like that,

6
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,513
it must be because I've neglected my cultivation lately.

7
00:02:49,272 --> 00:02:53,833
I feel ashamed for disgracing Master's teachings.

8
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:56,513
How could I face Lady Wu after this?

9
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,592
No rise of six desires, the spirit rests undisturbed.

10
00:03:09,320 --> 00:03:12,033
Spirit undisturbed, the mind finds stillness.

11
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:16,632
Heaven and earth as one, form without form.

12
00:03:17,960 --> 00:03:21,513
Untroubled by creation, serenity attained.

13
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:25,040
(Mind and matter are not two.)

14
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:44,032
Elder Gray, you seem composed and relax.

15
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,632
Cat Lord, to what do I owe this summons?

16
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:52,877
Did you enjoy your little game in the western suburbs?

17
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,833
I don't know what you're talking about.

18
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,993
Old rat, such a coward you are.

19
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:03,032
Bold enough to do it, but not to admit it.

20
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:05,993
Who do you think you are?

21
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,312
A half-demon freak.

22
00:04:10,960 --> 00:04:12,592
What right do you have to question me?

23
00:04:13,719 --> 00:04:16,876
If I had been the one to claim that power 18 years ago,

24
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:20,153
the one sitting in that seat today would be me!

25
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:23,993
How dare you. Such insolence before the Cat Lord.

26
00:04:24,519 --> 00:04:26,553
What are you talking about, Lord Shu?

27
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,480
You can't just throw wild accusations at me.

28
00:04:37,399 --> 00:04:38,399
Wild accusations?

29
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
Everyone...

30
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:44,553
Am I really framing him?

31
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:50,233
Cat Lord.

32
00:04:52,519 --> 00:04:53,913
You set me up!

33
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:58,040
You gathered them here and kept me in the dark.

34
00:04:58,399 --> 00:05:01,372
Well, you never asked.

35
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:05,512
Elder Gray, have you learned nothing in your centuries of living?

36
00:05:05,879 --> 00:05:07,312
How utterly tactless.

37
00:05:08,519 --> 00:05:11,960
I've lived for a thousand years, after all.

38
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:14,006
I think I've earned the right to throw my weight around.

39
00:05:14,093 --> 00:05:17,000
So what if I disrespect Cat Lord?

40
00:05:17,839 --> 00:05:20,353
I'm still an elder here.

41
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:22,517
What can any of you really do to me?

42
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:24,952
You really have grown senile.

43
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:28,913
Today's trial isn't for your impudence,

44
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,192
but for using the forbidden Astral Wandering Spell

45
00:05:33,519 --> 00:05:35,392
to flee Demon Market.

46
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:37,316
Do you have proof for that?

47
00:05:37,399 --> 00:05:38,399
Ling Xiao.

48
00:05:42,199 --> 00:05:43,199
My lord.

49
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:44,680
Tell them.

50
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:47,920
I witnessed Elder Gray invoke the Astral Wandering Spirit spell

51
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,632
at the barrier yesterday.

52
00:05:50,399 --> 00:05:55,872
But that technique wounds the caster himself.

53
00:05:56,079 --> 00:05:58,640
At Elder Gray's advanced age,

54
00:05:58,879 --> 00:06:02,153
would he really risk such a thing?

55
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,236
That's right. Could it be a misunderstanding, my lord?

56
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:08,033
Maybe we should let this go.

57
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,759
- Let's just drop it.   - Yes, let's drop it.

58
00:06:10,839 --> 00:06:14,632
Actually, there's a simple way to confirm his guilt.

59
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:17,693
I can test him.

60
00:06:17,879 --> 00:06:19,620
What? That's possible?

61
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:22,316
Does Cat Lord have some secret method?

62
00:06:22,399 --> 00:06:26,832
Regardless, Elder Gray isn't walking away easily today.

63
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:36,993
My lord...

64
00:06:55,959 --> 00:06:57,717
Why has Cat Lord drawn the Radiant Whip?

65
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:00,713
Is she going to test Elder Gray's spirit with it?

66
00:07:00,879 --> 00:07:02,560
- This is too extreme!   - Elder Gray.

67
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:05,153
Let's make a wager.

68
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,993
If the whip proves your spirit has left your body,

69
00:07:09,480 --> 00:07:10,553
you'll take the punishment.

70
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:12,952
But if it shows your spirit never left,

71
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:15,673
I'll take ten lashes myself

72
00:07:16,432 --> 00:07:17,906
for every one I give you.

73
00:07:18,600 --> 00:07:21,405
My lord, are you really going to strike me

74
00:07:21,485 --> 00:07:24,072
just because of what a flower demon said?

75
00:07:27,439 --> 00:07:28,673
This is obviously a setup!

76
00:07:39,279 --> 00:07:41,512
His spirit is fractured. He did use the technique!

77
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:42,680
The first lash

78
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,192
was for using forbidden arts.

79
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,840
The second lash

80
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,312
was for leaving Demon Market without permission.

81
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:00,713
The third lash

82
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:04,392
was for framing officials and harming innocents.

83
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,832
From this day forth,

84
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,952
Elder Gray is to be cast into the Demon Prison.

85
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,392
Let him reflect in darkness.

86
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:21,720
He...

87
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:01,313
Elder Gray, you seem to be enjoying your stay here.

88
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:07,073
As if troubling her before wasn't enough,

89
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:08,912
now you dare hurt her?

90
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,632
You've got some nerve.

91
00:09:13,559 --> 00:09:15,872
I'm still the master of Gray Sect.

92
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,913
You wouldn't kill me.

93
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:19,953
Oh, I won't kill you.

94
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,593
That would be too merciful.

95
00:09:22,766 --> 00:09:24,680
I'll come every day to torment you,

96
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,193
until you learn to regret

97
00:09:27,759 --> 00:09:29,032
every mistake you make.

98
00:09:29,720 --> 00:09:32,193
But as age weakens you,

99
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,194
your power might wither,

100
00:09:36,679 --> 00:09:38,073
and your wounds will stop healing.

101
00:09:38,559 --> 00:09:39,559
In the end,

102
00:09:40,559 --> 00:09:42,032
you'll wither away and die here.

103
00:09:42,639 --> 00:09:45,872
You think I don't know what you did to Qi Shi?

104
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:47,552
You killed my demon

105
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:49,954
and shattered my spirit in the western suburbs.

106
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:53,273
Well played, Lord Shu.

107
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,515
Compared to your schemes, mine are nothing.

108
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,313
Let me tell you this,

109
00:10:00,919 --> 00:10:04,032
killing Cat Lord in the western suburbs

110
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:06,193
had never been the goal.

111
00:10:06,840 --> 00:10:10,713
I wanted to stop her from obtaining the Lightning Wood.

112
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:12,157
What does that mean?

113
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:15,240
As long as she never claims it,

114
00:10:15,879 --> 00:10:19,596
I can keep the Undecaying Bone safe.

115
00:10:19,679 --> 00:10:22,713
Why would you want to keep that wicked thing safe?

116
00:10:26,919 --> 00:10:27,919
Wu Zi Shu,

117
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,397
you might have come into this world like a blank page,

118
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:35,353
but don't tell me you really have no desires, no ambition?

119
00:10:36,240 --> 00:10:37,473
Perhaps someday,

120
00:10:38,159 --> 00:10:42,152
we'll walk the same path.

121
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:49,113
I have chosen my companion for my path.

122
00:10:51,240 --> 00:10:53,920
(Liu Residence)

123
00:11:01,919 --> 00:11:03,872
So this is where you usually fish?

124
00:11:04,679 --> 00:11:05,679
More or less.

125
00:11:05,799 --> 00:11:06,993
More or less?

126
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,874
Fishing calms my mind.

127
00:11:09,559 --> 00:11:10,872
Whenever I feel unsettled,

128
00:11:11,523 --> 00:11:13,512
I come here, cast a line,

129
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:15,476
angling for peace.

130
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:18,833
And what peace were you finding messing with a young man?

131
00:11:21,679 --> 00:11:23,713
Zhen, don't blame Lady Liu.

132
00:11:24,559 --> 00:11:26,032
So what if I messed with him?

133
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:28,152
He's been making such a racket I can't get any rest.

134
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,116
Lady Liu, you know you shouldn't pick on my people.

135
00:11:34,279 --> 00:11:36,917
Si turns into an idiot whenever he sees you.

136
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:41,030
He even believed that nonsense about magic herbs in the west.

137
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,073
- It could be true.   - True, my foot!

138
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,712
It's fine that you don't like him, but you didn't have to toy with him.

139
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,713
Exercise is good for his health.

140
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,238
I wasn't really toying with him.

141
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:55,120
So Lady Liu, all that about a great exorcist and magic herbs

142
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,278
were lies?

143
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:57,400
Yes.

144
00:11:58,559 --> 00:11:59,559
Lady Liu,

145
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,093
I don't mind your usual pranks,

146
00:12:03,252 --> 00:12:05,326
but how could you trick me about something like that?

147
00:12:05,533 --> 00:12:06,600
I had to travel west...

148
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:08,113
I didn't know you'd really go.

149
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:15,713
What if I'd gone too far and couldn't come back...

150
00:12:17,840 --> 00:12:18,954
To protect you?

151
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:22,552
Did you cast a love spell on him?

152
00:12:23,759 --> 00:12:26,833
Mei Si, there are no demons in my residence.

153
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:29,836
You didn't see it, but I did!

154
00:12:29,919 --> 00:12:33,433
That serpent demon could be hiding in the trees, in the pond...

155
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:36,880
Maybe even on you.

156
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:38,120
Is that so?

157
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:43,277
If you're so worried, why don't you get in the pond

158
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,193
and check if the demon is in there?

159
00:12:47,559 --> 00:12:49,819
For you, I will.

160
00:12:50,039 --> 00:12:51,593
Liu Tai Zhen, that's going too far.

161
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:54,960
He offered to drive away the demons. I didn't make him.

162
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:56,556
You know he'll do whatever you say.

163
00:12:56,680 --> 00:12:57,793
That's his choice.

164
00:12:58,360 --> 00:12:59,679
- Stop fighting!   - Stay out of this!

165
00:13:18,679 --> 00:13:20,193
Oh... This is...

166
00:13:22,600 --> 00:13:23,600
I didn't see anything.

167
00:13:25,080 --> 00:13:26,080
I didn't see anything.

168
00:13:27,559 --> 00:13:28,559
Stay calm.

169
00:13:29,759 --> 00:13:31,272
Shouldn't you be taking my side here?

170
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:33,792
You're much older than him. Just be a bigger person.

171
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,152
Let it go.

172
00:13:36,360 --> 00:13:38,157
I swear, I didn't see anything.

173
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:39,676
I didn't see anything.

174
00:13:39,759 --> 00:13:40,759
Get lost.

175
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:43,993
Right away.

176
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:56,519
What's going on here?

177
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:00,519
Nothing.

178
00:14:00,879 --> 00:14:01,879
What do you want?

179
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:04,519
Boss,

180
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:05,840
we have a problem.

181
00:14:08,840 --> 00:14:09,993
What is going on?

182
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:12,692
We brought in the best physician from the western district

183
00:14:12,773 --> 00:14:13,806
as you ordered.

184
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:16,272
But the situation is more complicated than we thought.

185
00:14:21,080 --> 00:14:22,277
It's been days.

186
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:24,433
Why is my husband still asleep?

187
00:14:25,039 --> 00:14:27,512
Why? When will he wake up?

188
00:14:32,273 --> 00:14:33,306
What are you doing here?

189
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,272
I was going to report back to the Bureau,

190
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,553
but then I heard the victims' condition had worsened.

191
00:14:41,039 --> 00:14:42,833
I only just received word myself.

192
00:14:43,559 --> 00:14:45,993
His Majesty sent me to check on them.

193
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:49,360
Her Highness is here!

194
00:14:49,679 --> 00:14:51,272
Make way, people! Her Highness is here!

195
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,080
Your Highness, Keeper Mei.

196
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:57,120
- Your Highness.   - Spare the formalities.

197
00:14:57,840 --> 00:14:58,917
How are they?

198
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:01,433
Judging by their pulses,

199
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:02,953
they are not in immediate danger,

200
00:15:03,360 --> 00:15:04,872
but their pulses are weak.

201
00:15:05,080 --> 00:15:06,632
I'm afraid my skills are lacking.

202
00:15:06,799 --> 00:15:08,833
Even with herbs and acupuncture,

203
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:11,392
I still can't bring them back to consciousness.

204
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,473
Physician, what do we do?

205
00:15:14,679 --> 00:15:16,596
Please help my husband!

206
00:15:16,679 --> 00:15:19,713
Boss, the miasma is circulating in their bodies.

207
00:15:19,879 --> 00:15:22,320
If it isn't cleared, even if they wake,

208
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:23,793
they'll suffer a grave illness.

209
00:15:25,240 --> 00:15:27,113
- Physician...   - Even the physicians of Chang'an

210
00:15:27,320 --> 00:15:29,836
have no counter for miasma.

211
00:15:30,039 --> 00:15:34,436
Help! Pervert! Pervert!

212
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:36,920
Where? Where is the pervert?

213
00:15:37,019 --> 00:15:38,019
Come on.

214
00:15:40,879 --> 00:15:41,993
What happened?

215
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:45,000
A half-dressed pervert

216
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,877
climbed in through the window

217
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:49,032
and tried to force himself on us!

218
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:53,672
He saw my body! No man will marry me now!

219
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:57,032
In broad daylight! The audacity!

220
00:15:57,399 --> 00:15:58,993
He has no respect for law or decency!

221
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,832
Pervert! The audacity of you to commit such act!

222
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:06,000
(Shuang Jiang, Exorcist of Changxi Palace)

223
00:16:12,840 --> 00:16:14,796
Get him! Get him!

224
00:16:14,879 --> 00:16:19,552
Get him! Get him!

225
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:24,519
Wait!

226
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,039
You've got it wrong. I'm not a pervert.

227
00:16:27,399 --> 00:16:29,400
I am Shuang Jiang, an exorcist of Changxi Palace.

228
00:16:29,560 --> 00:16:30,560
What did you say?

229
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,000
Changxi Palace?

230
00:16:32,840 --> 00:16:33,840
Changxi Palace?

231
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:35,353
I've never heard of it.

232
00:16:36,890 --> 00:16:40,353
They say Changxi Palace vanished from Chang'an a hundred years ago.

233
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:43,760
Since then, countless impostors have claimed its name,

234
00:16:44,039 --> 00:16:45,840
charlatans, every one of them.

235
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:48,280
We have heard a lot of lies like that.

236
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:51,233
You think dropping its name

237
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:53,912
excuses your breaking and entering

238
00:16:54,039 --> 00:16:55,593
with wicked intent?

239
00:16:56,399 --> 00:16:58,353
It was an accident.

240
00:17:18,240 --> 00:17:19,953
Pervert!

241
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:25,953
So let me get this straight,

242
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,072
you came to Chang'an looking for someone,

243
00:17:28,279 --> 00:17:29,473
but you got lost.

244
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:30,877
Your bag fell down the mountain,

245
00:17:30,960 --> 00:17:32,200
you accidentally broke into a house,

246
00:17:32,273 --> 00:17:33,666
then decided to help yourself to food,

247
00:17:34,079 --> 00:17:35,393
and just happened to choke

248
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:37,473
when you were caught?

249
00:17:38,119 --> 00:17:39,119
That's pretty much

250
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:40,832
what happened.

251
00:17:41,559 --> 00:17:42,637
You tell it better than me.

252
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:45,393
That's too many coincidences for one story.

253
00:17:45,640 --> 00:17:47,713
- I...   - She's right.

254
00:17:48,039 --> 00:17:50,520
Liar! Liar!

255
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:51,873
That big oaf is dumber than a rock.

256
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:54,233
If he's really from Changxi Palace,

257
00:17:54,359 --> 00:17:56,352
then that place must've fallen hard.

258
00:17:57,039 --> 00:17:59,752
We'll know once we test his skills.

259
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Mister,

260
00:18:07,319 --> 00:18:08,953
if you really are a disciple of Changxi Palace,

261
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:11,112
why don't you prove it?

262
00:18:11,599 --> 00:18:12,599
How?

263
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:15,153
They say Daoist Mystic Arts can achieve anything.

264
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:18,960
Changxi Palace's disciples are skilled at dispelling illness and evil.

265
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:22,673
And we happen to have a problem.

266
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:24,640
Yes, yes.

267
00:18:25,079 --> 00:18:28,792
The physician said He San and the others were cursed.

268
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,597
If you can wake them up,

269
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:33,157
we'll believe you're no fraud.

270
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:36,600
- Otherwise, you're just a lecherous intruder.   - Yes!

271
00:18:36,680 --> 00:18:39,436
This I can absolutely do!

272
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:40,752
Yes!

273
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,112
Let's see what he can do.

274
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:54,559
What is that?

275
00:18:56,400 --> 00:18:57,400
What is that for?

276
00:18:57,599 --> 00:18:59,473
He's using the Seven Rites Exorcism Array?

277
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:01,032
Such overkill.

278
00:19:01,279 --> 00:19:03,233
This is the Seven Rites Exorcism Array.

279
00:19:03,759 --> 00:19:07,312
I'll extract the demonic aura from them.

280
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:10,792
Please step back a little, or you might get hurt!

281
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:30,433
All this fuss over some miasma? Isn't that overkill?

282
00:19:30,839 --> 00:19:32,330
Mortals like to complicate things.

283
00:19:33,799 --> 00:19:34,993
Understandable, I suppose.

284
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:38,233
He misplaced the beans and the incense burner.

285
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:41,200
The ritual won't work.

286
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:47,519
Heaven gathers purity, earth holds true essence.

287
00:19:47,599 --> 00:19:50,640
Laws shift in myriad forms, banish evil and guard the flesh. Rise!

288
00:19:56,559 --> 00:19:57,559
It's flying!

289
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:05,512
Could my cultivation be lacking?

290
00:20:05,759 --> 00:20:07,112
Wait, it's not like that!

291
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Let me try again!

292
00:20:09,680 --> 00:20:10,713
I knew you were a liar!

293
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:16,797
Heaven gathers purity, earth holds true essence.

294
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:20,119
Laws shift in myriad forms, banish evil and guard the flesh. Rise!

295
00:20:59,359 --> 00:21:00,633
They're awake!

296
00:21:01,319 --> 00:21:02,996
Thank you, Master! Thank you!

297
00:21:03,079 --> 00:21:04,079
I did it?

298
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,272
I'm so good at this! I can't believe it!

299
00:21:07,839 --> 00:21:09,112
Forgive us earlier.

300
00:21:11,799 --> 00:21:13,276
Thank you, Celestial Master!

301
00:21:13,359 --> 00:21:14,752
Thank you!

302
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,032
Don't mention it. I was just doing what I should.

303
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:20,713
Remember, spread my name far and wide.

304
00:21:21,759 --> 00:21:23,433
So he really does know exorcism.

305
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,752
Boss, if he really is from Changxi Palace,

306
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,112
he'll be a problem.

307
00:21:28,599 --> 00:21:29,713
It was nothing.

308
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:32,792
Where is Mr. Mei?

309
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:36,759
I don't know.

310
00:21:37,079 --> 00:21:38,592
He's been gone for a while.

311
00:21:40,119 --> 00:21:41,673
Now that Shuang Jiang is here,

312
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,153
my identity will be exposed if I show myself.

313
00:21:44,880 --> 00:21:46,633
I'd better hide somewhere before he sees him.

314
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:52,433
Thank you for helping us, Celestial Master Shuang Jiang.

315
00:21:52,640 --> 00:21:54,953
You've given us a true display of Daoist Mystic Arts.

316
00:21:55,640 --> 00:21:56,913
It was eye-opening.

317
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,633
You opened my eyes too.

318
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,877
Only one person's ever beaten me before.

319
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:03,272
You managed to fight me to a draw.

320
00:22:04,359 --> 00:22:06,352
It was embarrassing for me.

321
00:22:06,880 --> 00:22:09,561
We've got to fight again and settle this once and for all.

322
00:22:09,641 --> 00:22:11,072
You're much bigger than her.

323
00:22:11,279 --> 00:22:12,832
And you're challenging a woman.

324
00:22:12,920 --> 00:22:13,920
Have you no shame?

325
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,000
What of it?

326
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,552
What's gender got to do with it? Martial arts don't discriminate.

327
00:22:17,759 --> 00:22:21,433
Agreed. Our spar was fate.

328
00:22:22,319 --> 00:22:24,913
Since you're going to Chang'an as well,

329
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:26,752
would you like to travel with us?

330
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:29,393
Perhaps we can compare techniques on the road.

331
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:31,346
Alright! We'll travel together then.

332
00:22:37,599 --> 00:22:39,512
Please get in, Celestial Master.

333
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:45,913
Well this is interesting.

334
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:49,072
I was wondering where you had been.

335
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:50,913
What's this then?

336
00:22:52,079 --> 00:22:54,272
Waiting in the carriage to surprise me?

337
00:22:55,359 --> 00:22:56,359
No.

338
00:22:56,519 --> 00:22:57,552
He was waiting for me.

339
00:22:58,920 --> 00:23:01,319
- I've finally found you, Seni...   - Eleventh Brother.

340
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,000
Lady Wu,

341
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:21,306
you didn't have to give us a ride.

342
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:25,033
It's not your first time in my carriage.

343
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:29,153
You weren't nearly this distant that night in the mountains.

344
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:34,518
Tenth Brother, what's between you two?

345
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:35,640
Nothing.

346
00:23:43,640 --> 00:23:45,839
Have some, Celestial Master, Keeper Mei.

347
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,832
Thank you, Lady Wu, but I'll pass.

348
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:03,713
You've certainly grown distant after we left the mountains.

349
00:24:14,359 --> 00:24:17,393
So the friend you came all the way to Chang'an to find

350
00:24:17,839 --> 00:24:19,312
was Mr. Mei all along?

351
00:24:20,839 --> 00:24:23,512
How long have you known each other?

352
00:24:23,599 --> 00:24:25,673
Shuang Jiang and I are from Quzhou.

353
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:28,272
He was drawn to Daoist Mystic Arts since he was little,

354
00:24:28,519 --> 00:24:29,806
so he devoted himself to cultivation.

355
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,032
After I came to Chang'an,

356
00:24:31,599 --> 00:24:32,993
I sent him letters occasionally.

357
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,312
I suppose he came seeking me out.

358
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,153
Meeting again here today was pure coincidence.

359
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:43,393
You never mentioned

360
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,252
having such an impressive hometown friend, Mr. Mei.

361
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:48,913
The world really is full of hidden talents.

362
00:24:49,319 --> 00:24:50,319
Indeed.

363
00:24:50,720 --> 00:24:51,953
Until I came to the Archives,

364
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:53,473
even I didn't know your father

365
00:24:53,680 --> 00:24:56,752
shared Shuang Jiang's passion for Daoist Mystic Arts.

366
00:25:00,279 --> 00:25:02,953
What do you call each other again?

367
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:04,720
Tenth Brother?

368
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:06,272
Eleventh Brother?

369
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:09,026
Looks like you have quite a large family back home.

370
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,393
Yes, we do have a large family back in Quzhou.

371
00:25:12,519 --> 00:25:16,832
You look older than him though.

372
00:25:17,599 --> 00:25:18,873
I'm the same age as Tenth Brother,

373
00:25:19,599 --> 00:25:21,993
just a little older, that's all.

374
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:24,433
But other people's ranking is by age,

375
00:25:24,514 --> 00:25:25,707
ours is by seniority.

376
00:25:25,880 --> 00:25:27,880
- What does that mean?   - We're distant cousins.

377
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,512
There are eleven of us brothers.

378
00:25:31,000 --> 00:25:33,032
The first ten were ranked by age,

379
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:34,840
but Shuang Jiang and I

380
00:25:35,720 --> 00:25:36,993
met last.

381
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:38,873
I wanted a higher place at first,

382
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,072
but after a spar with Tenth Brother and losing,

383
00:25:41,359 --> 00:25:43,312
I had to take the last spot.

384
00:25:44,519 --> 00:25:47,072
So you really are strong in martial arts.

385
00:25:50,279 --> 00:25:51,913
Well, I'm not exactly weak either.

386
00:25:53,480 --> 00:25:54,480
What is that?

387
00:25:55,440 --> 00:25:56,440
Oh, this?

388
00:25:57,119 --> 00:25:58,153
It's a hunting trophy.

389
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,832
I made it especially for my blade.

390
00:26:00,039 --> 00:26:01,117
A seven-colored fox tail.

391
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:02,233
Looks good on it, doesn't it?

392
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:05,279
Why is she...

393
00:26:06,839 --> 00:26:10,433
Your glorious exploits spooked her a little.

394
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:12,713
So you don't like hearing something like that.

395
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:29,520
(Chang'an)

396
00:26:38,920 --> 00:26:41,572
Thank you for the ride, Lady Wu. We will take our leave now.

397
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:00,993
Boss, you're acting strange today.

398
00:27:02,279 --> 00:27:03,913
It's Mr. Mei who's strange.

399
00:27:04,359 --> 00:27:05,359
Strange, how?

400
00:27:07,446 --> 00:27:10,112
Normally he's so calm and collected,

401
00:27:10,799 --> 00:27:12,153
but he looked like...

402
00:27:14,079 --> 00:27:15,752
He was hiding something.

403
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:17,913
Now that you say it,

404
00:27:18,319 --> 00:27:19,752
it did seem like that.

405
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,693
They knew each other.

406
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:25,913
If Shuang Jiang is really connected to Changxi Palace,

407
00:27:26,839 --> 00:27:29,112
Mr. Mei must be too.

408
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:31,072
So you're suspecting Mr. Mei now.

409
00:27:32,039 --> 00:27:33,792
Better to doubt than trust the wrong person.

410
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,533
Keep a close watch on Mei Residence

411
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:38,153
and Celestial Master Shuang Jiang.

412
00:27:38,680 --> 00:27:39,680
Yes, Boss.

413
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,312
Just one more question,

414
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,032
if Mr. Mei really is involved with Changxi Palace,

415
00:27:46,712 --> 00:27:47,712
what will you do?

416
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:53,393
With Elder Hui in prison,

417
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,913
the other sects and clans are on edge.

418
00:27:57,000 --> 00:27:59,512
I've been hearing whispers among the demons

419
00:28:00,160 --> 00:28:02,953
that your methods are reckless.

420
00:28:04,080 --> 00:28:05,720
I know what I'm doing.

421
00:28:13,112 --> 00:28:15,265
Se...

422
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:17,880
Senior.

423
00:28:18,160 --> 00:28:19,233
This is where you live?

424
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:31,953
Why did you suddenly come looking for me?

425
00:28:32,799 --> 00:28:34,752
The mountain was boring anyway.

426
00:28:35,119 --> 00:28:36,516
Ever since you left Changxi Palace,

427
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:38,034
my days have been unbearably dull.

428
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:39,953
You know how our eldest senior brother is,

429
00:28:40,045 --> 00:28:41,239
strict to the point of suffocation.

430
00:28:41,400 --> 00:28:42,873
Now that he's head of the sect,

431
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:44,873
he tests us every single day.

432
00:28:45,039 --> 00:28:47,193
I've been punished nine times in three days.

433
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:51,752
Don't tell me you ran off just to escape punishment.

434
00:28:52,119 --> 00:28:53,119
Of course not.

435
00:28:53,559 --> 00:28:56,193
Our eldest senior brother said since I'm no good with books,

436
00:28:56,599 --> 00:28:59,393
memorizing texts with nine other seniors is a waste of time,

437
00:28:59,559 --> 00:29:00,713
I might as well come see you.

438
00:29:00,839 --> 00:29:01,913
Practical experience

439
00:29:02,160 --> 00:29:04,433
might help me grasp the real essence of the arts.

440
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:06,279
Besides...

441
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:09,640
Besides?

442
00:29:10,359 --> 00:29:13,072
They claimed my daily sword practice

443
00:29:13,326 --> 00:29:14,838
was killing all the flowers in the mountains.

444
00:29:19,240 --> 00:29:21,839
You can stay in Chang'an,

445
00:29:23,799 --> 00:29:25,792
but we need some ground rules.

446
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,552
Ground rules?

447
00:29:29,480 --> 00:29:30,794
Alright, let's hear them.

448
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,153
First, we are cousins here.

449
00:29:35,359 --> 00:29:38,433
Second, you must never mention my ties to Changxi Palace.

450
00:29:40,360 --> 00:29:41,400
- Third...   - Hold on.

451
00:29:41,920 --> 00:29:42,920
Why?

452
00:29:45,960 --> 00:29:47,393
Do you know why I left the mountain?

453
00:29:49,360 --> 00:29:50,360
No.

454
00:29:52,560 --> 00:29:55,234
I returned to Chang'an to investigate the truth

455
00:29:56,091 --> 00:29:57,525
behind my parents' death.

456
00:29:58,400 --> 00:30:00,512
I've always suspected more to the story,

457
00:30:01,599 --> 00:30:02,832
possibly involving demons.

458
00:30:03,079 --> 00:30:04,079
Demons!

459
00:30:04,359 --> 00:30:06,713
You think demons caused the Heavenly Fire?

460
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,512
I don't know yet.

461
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,512
Until I know for sure,

462
00:30:12,880 --> 00:30:14,112
I must keep my identity hidden

463
00:30:14,359 --> 00:30:15,359
to avoid unwanted attention.

464
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:17,673
I see.

465
00:30:21,079 --> 00:30:23,993
- Third...   - Do the other seniors know?

466
00:30:25,640 --> 00:30:26,993
I don't think so.

467
00:30:27,920 --> 00:30:29,559
- Third...   - Does Master know?

468
00:30:29,640 --> 00:30:31,480
- He does. Third...   - Then...

469
00:30:34,800 --> 00:30:35,954
Please carry on.

470
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:38,552
Keep a low profile.

471
00:30:38,947 --> 00:30:41,179
Speak less. Ask less.

472
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:44,272
Then, senior brother,

473
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:45,972
can I ask one more question?

474
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:49,353
Just one more.

475
00:30:51,720 --> 00:30:52,752
Got any food?

476
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:55,193
Haven't you been eating the whole trip back?

477
00:31:00,599 --> 00:31:01,599
In the kitchen.

478
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:49,072
I returned late last night,

479
00:31:49,319 --> 00:31:50,460
so I forgot to make introductions.

480
00:31:51,079 --> 00:31:52,079
This is Shuang Jiang.

481
00:31:53,119 --> 00:31:54,119
This is Wen Hua.

482
00:31:57,359 --> 00:31:59,153
Pleasure. I'm from Quzhou,

483
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:00,480
a cousin of Tenth Brother.

484
00:32:00,680 --> 00:32:02,032
I'm here to see Chang'an's wonders.

485
00:32:02,599 --> 00:32:03,599
And you are?

486
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:08,276
I'm Young Master's personal attendant,

487
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:09,476
guard, steward,

488
00:32:09,572 --> 00:32:12,045
and second-in-command of the entire Mei Residence.

489
00:32:15,359 --> 00:32:17,552
But there's only two of you here, isn't there?

490
00:32:18,160 --> 00:32:19,160
We have Fu Gui too!

491
00:32:38,519 --> 00:32:41,032
Changxi Palace may be a place of cultivation,

492
00:32:41,319 --> 00:32:43,072
but we don't shun wine or meat.

493
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:45,352
Why would you come all the way to Chang'an

494
00:32:45,680 --> 00:32:47,720
just to live such hard life?

495
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:49,313
Here comes your favourite, Young Master!

496
00:32:50,245 --> 00:32:51,559
Blanched greens!

497
00:32:56,039 --> 00:32:59,552
What's wrong? Is my cooking not to your taste?

498
00:32:59,680 --> 00:33:00,713
It's not that.

499
00:33:01,039 --> 00:33:04,512
Just this food is too plain.

500
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:05,799
It's ruining

501
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:07,752
my appetite.

502
00:33:08,960 --> 00:33:11,040
The audacity of you to whine when you're freeloading off us.

503
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:12,120
Say that again!

504
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,480
- I...   - Don't quarrel.

505
00:33:14,599 --> 00:33:16,393
I wasn't. I was just teasing him.

506
00:33:16,519 --> 00:33:19,112
Yes, Young Master. We were just joking around.

507
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:22,754
There's no meat here.

508
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,080
Because we have no money.

509
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:29,481
Zhu Yu, where are you going?

510
00:33:29,680 --> 00:33:31,272
Make more money to buy some meat.

511
00:33:34,527 --> 00:33:38,527
(Arcane Appraisal Bureau)

512
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:04,920
Why did you stop...

513
00:34:09,880 --> 00:34:11,473
Greetings...

514
00:34:13,880 --> 00:34:14,996
Greetings, Minister.

515
00:34:15,079 --> 00:34:16,313
So, about the western suburbs case,

516
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:19,800
I'm assuming Arcane Appraisal Bureau hasn't found anything, huh?

517
00:34:20,519 --> 00:34:22,476
That case is particularly challenging.

518
00:34:22,559 --> 00:34:26,112
Why haven't you assigned more men to it then, Commissioner Xu?

519
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:27,639
More men?

520
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:33,112
Instead, you're here soaking your feet, basking in the sun.

521
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:38,072
One of your men is missing,

522
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:40,139
you couldn't be bothered to send a search party?

523
00:34:40,400 --> 00:34:41,400
Commissioner Xu...

524
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:44,632
Remarkably relaxed attitude

525
00:34:45,466 --> 00:34:47,979
for someone whose subordinate might be dead.

526
00:34:48,199 --> 00:34:49,199
D-dead?

527
00:34:51,440 --> 00:34:52,632
Are you saying...

528
00:34:58,360 --> 00:34:59,753
Keeper Mei has really

529
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:01,440
met with misfortune?

530
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,312
Oh, Mei Zhu Yu,

531
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:06,192
you should've listened to me.

532
00:35:07,480 --> 00:35:08,480
Commissioner Xu.

533
00:35:29,559 --> 00:35:31,192
Mei, you're back!

534
00:35:31,639 --> 00:35:32,639
Are you hurt?

535
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:33,840
Minister Liu.

536
00:35:35,240 --> 00:35:37,273
The western suburbs case was indeed complex.

537
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:40,433
We spent three days probing before we could resolve it.

538
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,353
I beg your pardon for the delay.

539
00:35:44,079 --> 00:35:45,079
Keeper Mei,

540
00:35:45,679 --> 00:35:48,793
word of the case has reached His Majesty and the Empress.

541
00:35:49,039 --> 00:35:51,080
You saved Princess Qing He.

542
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,152
Her Majesty is most grateful.

543
00:35:54,519 --> 00:35:55,519
What?

544
00:35:56,400 --> 00:35:57,753
The case was really solved?

545
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,112
I dare not speak carelessly,

546
00:35:59,639 --> 00:36:02,280
but yes, the case is solved.

547
00:36:06,159 --> 00:36:08,873
The western suburbs incident was caused by mountain miasma.

548
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,192
I've cleared it for the time being.

549
00:36:11,679 --> 00:36:14,112
The villagers who fell unconscious have been revived by physicians.

550
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:17,152
Minister Liu, you may dispatch men to verify it yourself.

551
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,313
The woods there are dense and prone to foul vapors.

552
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:24,112
More wardens should be stationed

553
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:27,032
to regularly cleanse the terrain

554
00:36:27,119 --> 00:36:28,353
and manage wildlife,

555
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:30,753
lest this misfortune occur again.

556
00:36:31,400 --> 00:36:32,400
Good.

557
00:36:33,199 --> 00:36:35,626
You really live up to your promise, so young and already accomplished.

558
00:36:35,707 --> 00:36:37,013
A subordinate surpasses his superior.

559
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:40,360
Commissioner Xu.

560
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:44,800
Commissioner Xu,

561
00:36:45,800 --> 00:36:47,592
if only you showed half this diligence,

562
00:36:47,960 --> 00:36:50,277
perhaps the people wouldn't accuse the Bureau

563
00:36:50,360 --> 00:36:53,032
of sitting idle while getting paid.

564
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:56,760
Keeper Mei,

565
00:36:57,079 --> 00:37:00,793
such merit demands reward.

566
00:37:02,199 --> 00:37:05,180
Do not refuse, you deserve it.

567
00:37:06,559 --> 00:37:09,072
And it will remind all within the Bureau

568
00:37:09,519 --> 00:37:12,953
that this is no place for idlers to sit about soaking their feet.

569
00:37:17,559 --> 00:37:20,036
So long as one serves the people with true intent,

570
00:37:20,119 --> 00:37:22,192
the court will never withhold its due.

571
00:37:22,960 --> 00:37:23,960
Minister Liu,

572
00:37:24,239 --> 00:37:26,753
I wasn't going to refuse.

573
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:32,152
Go on then, what reward do you seek?

574
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,156
I ask for a promotion.

575
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:36,672
But of course!

576
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,672
Then I shall promote you to...

577
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,592
I wish to remain in Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

578
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:42,953
Arcane Appraisal Bureau?

579
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:47,993
But the only vacant seat there is Supervisor.

580
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:52,077
Far beneath your talents.

581
00:37:52,199 --> 00:37:53,199
That's right.

582
00:37:55,960 --> 00:37:56,960
Minister Liu,

583
00:37:57,159 --> 00:37:58,592
I, Mei Zhu Yu, formally petition

584
00:37:58,719 --> 00:38:00,152
for the post of Commissioner

585
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:02,112
of Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

586
00:38:15,159 --> 00:38:17,393
Who would've thought

587
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:21,112
Keeper Mei had such nerve!

588
00:38:22,960 --> 00:38:25,192
It's not just nerve,

589
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:26,700
ambition.

590
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,520
That's right.

591
00:38:28,760 --> 00:38:31,873
To say right in front of Commissioner Xu that he wants his seat?

592
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:33,793
The audacity!

593
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:41,632
Minister Liu has left.

594
00:38:42,579 --> 00:38:44,480
And Commissioner Xu didn't curse me.

595
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:47,033
Unbelievable!

596
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:49,313
You practically mounted his office throne!

597
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:50,793
And he didn't yell at you?

598
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:54,833
What on earth did you two say afterward?

599
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:56,599
Out of the way.

600
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:00,393
So, Mei,

601
00:39:00,960 --> 00:39:03,192
I'm just the messenger.

602
00:39:03,639 --> 00:39:07,353
Princess Qing He has invited you

603
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,553
to meet her at Ruyi Pavilion at noon.

604
00:39:10,960 --> 00:39:12,913
She has prepared a modest banquet

605
00:39:13,880 --> 00:39:14,880
and awaits your arrival.

606
00:39:20,600 --> 00:39:22,840
(Ruyi Pavilion)

607
00:39:36,240 --> 00:39:38,240
Didn't you say you invited that Mr. Mei to dine with you?

608
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:40,192
He claimed he was buried in official duties

609
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:41,558
and he wasn't much of a drinker.

610
00:39:41,639 --> 00:39:42,639
He declined.

611
00:39:43,199 --> 00:39:47,192
He must be the very first in all of Chang'an to dare turn you down.

612
00:39:47,840 --> 00:39:49,286
This deserves historical recording!

613
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:55,632
Don't you think this fox here has gotten progressively more annoying?

614
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:01,993
As long as she never claims it,

615
00:40:02,639 --> 00:40:06,592
I can keep the Undecaying Bone safe.

616
00:40:07,239 --> 00:40:10,232
Why would you want to keep that wicked thing safe?

617
00:40:10,726 --> 00:40:11,726
Wu Zi Shu,

618
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:16,039
you might have come into this world like a blank page,

619
00:40:16,119 --> 00:40:18,433
but don't tell me you really have no desires,

620
00:40:19,239 --> 00:40:20,313
no ambition?

621
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:24,440
Shu?

622
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:28,072
- Yes?   - What's going on with you?

623
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:29,793
You've been looking distracted lately.

624
00:40:31,199 --> 00:40:32,199
I'm fine.

625
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:38,318
The affairs of the Demon Market have been piling up lately.

626
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:39,552
I'm just a little tired.

627
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:44,913
By the way, speaking of Mr. Mei,

628
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:47,313
his cousin set up a stall on the streets today,

629
00:40:47,506 --> 00:40:49,179
claiming he's offering exorcism service.

630
00:40:49,920 --> 00:40:53,440
That big guy really is odd, very suspicious.

631
00:40:54,280 --> 00:40:58,433
But would Changxi Palace really send someone that obvious?

632
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:02,512
For a hundred years, Demon Market and Changxi Palace

633
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,636
have been like water and fire.

634
00:41:04,719 --> 00:41:06,672
If they're returning,

635
00:41:07,239 --> 00:41:09,353
our troubles have just begun.

636
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:11,632
Perhaps we can test him

637
00:41:12,239 --> 00:41:14,933
to see what he's capable of.

638
00:41:15,045 --> 00:41:16,045
Test him?

639
00:41:17,199 --> 00:41:19,313
How are you going to test him, Boss?

640
00:41:21,335 --> 00:41:23,560
Let's see what chaos blooms in Chang'an

641
00:41:24,208 --> 00:41:26,120
that we can use to test him.
