00:01:27,214 --> 00:01:31,005
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,086 --> 00:01:34,000
(Episode 12)

3
00:01:37,087 --> 00:01:38,680
We have unfinished business.

4
00:01:39,056 --> 00:01:41,336
I've been wondering how to settle it.

5
00:01:43,255 --> 00:01:45,049
I finally figured it out recently.

6
00:01:46,959 --> 00:01:49,112
So let's do it your way, Elder Gray.

7
00:01:50,776 --> 00:01:54,329
Winner takes all. Loser loses everything.

8
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:57,712
What do you say?

9
00:02:00,086 --> 00:02:01,880
Excellent.

10
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:04,633
Then dare you open the Arena of Death?

11
00:02:04,808 --> 00:02:06,720
And accept a Deathmatch?

12
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:13,712
If I win,

13
00:02:14,327 --> 00:02:15,999
you'll no longer be

14
00:02:17,184 --> 00:02:19,000
master of the Gray Sect.

15
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,040
That's the Deathmatch.

16
00:02:35,121 --> 00:02:37,000
The Cat Lord and an Elder are having a Deathmatch?

17
00:02:37,151 --> 00:02:38,600
This is unprecedented!

18
00:02:40,432 --> 00:02:43,443
A deathmatch on the night of the new moon. No rules, no mercy.

19
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:46,513
The challenge is issued. The entire Demon City knows of it now.

20
00:02:46,736 --> 00:02:48,720
What's wrong? You're afraid to accept it?

21
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,679
Looks like he's dead set on this.

22
00:02:58,759 --> 00:02:59,953
If you ask me,

23
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,760
no one will walk away from this unscathed.

24
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,200
Will Cat Lord accept it?

25
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,600
No matter who dies, it'll shake everything.

26
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,680
Don't even say that!

27
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,420
Challenge accepted.

28
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:25,319
Accepted, my foot!

29
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:29,872
Serpent Lord...

30
00:03:31,199 --> 00:03:33,312
What is a Deathmatch?

31
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:35,912
Zhu Ying, you're still young,

32
00:03:36,160 --> 00:03:37,600
and you don't spend much time in the city.

33
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:39,073
It's normal you wouldn't know.

34
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,353
The Deathmatch was established by the Two Lords.

35
00:03:43,039 --> 00:03:44,600
It was meant as a final safeguard,

36
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,160
to prevent the city's power from falling into the hands of vicious demons.

37
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:49,553
The Cat Lord and Elders stand above all others,

38
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:51,472
but if the masses refuse to bow to them,

39
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:53,553
they can challenge them for a Deathmatch.

40
00:03:55,639 --> 00:03:58,912
The two opponents shed all status and background.

41
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:01,032
In the arena, only skill matters.

42
00:04:01,656 --> 00:04:02,872
But once the challenge is accepted,

43
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:05,073
there's no turning back.

44
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:08,032
No one has invoked a Deathmatch in a century.

45
00:04:08,199 --> 00:04:10,239
For a Demon Lord and an Elder to fight to the death,

46
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:11,673
it's unprecedented.

47
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:14,520
This really is...

48
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:17,553
Too reckless.

49
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,872
That's why I came to ask for your help, Serpent Lord,

50
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:23,872
surely there must be a way to defuse this.

51
00:04:28,519 --> 00:04:29,519
There is no way.

52
00:04:29,959 --> 00:04:31,233
My lord...

53
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:34,920
But...

54
00:04:36,920 --> 00:04:38,593
If Kitty dies,

55
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,553
I'll take her place in the arena

56
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:43,993
and gut that old rat myself.

57
00:05:11,240 --> 00:05:13,312
Lady Wu, what are you doing?

58
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:18,199
Fishing.

59
00:05:20,079 --> 00:05:21,079
Quite the appetite.

60
00:05:22,399 --> 00:05:23,632
Hu Zhu sent it over.

61
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,153
How thoughtful of her.

62
00:05:27,959 --> 00:05:29,233
A farewell meal

63
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,913
ought to be a good one.

64
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:34,680
Pardon me?

65
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:38,320
Nothing.

66
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:42,673
Is something bothering you?

67
00:05:53,040 --> 00:05:54,713
I was thinking, if I had the chance,

68
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,072
I'd build a golden chamber for you in my residence.

69
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:02,913
And have me recite Rhapsody of the Abandoned Wife in there?

70
00:06:03,519 --> 00:06:05,553
You know that old scandalous tale?

71
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:07,558
Just finished reading it.

72
00:06:07,639 --> 00:06:10,512
Duke Wu's Manor has quite the library.

73
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:15,993
That's true, though you've been reading the wrong books.

74
00:06:17,920 --> 00:06:19,353
And now,

75
00:06:19,839 --> 00:06:21,353
you are comparing me to a faithless lover.

76
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:24,872
You're the one who's always teasing me with nonsense.

77
00:06:28,839 --> 00:06:30,913
That doesn't sound like something you'd usually say.

78
00:06:34,280 --> 00:06:35,400
What I mean is,

79
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,352
don't say things you haven't fully thought through.

80
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,480
Don't make promises you might not be able to keep.

81
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,034
So you never speak without weighing your words?

82
00:06:49,279 --> 00:06:50,279
Senior brother,

83
00:06:50,639 --> 00:06:52,080
have you forgotten the rule?

84
00:06:52,439 --> 00:06:54,632
Disciples of Changxi Palace are forbidden to love.

85
00:06:54,959 --> 00:06:55,959
I haven't forgotten.

86
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:57,160
You and her

87
00:06:57,639 --> 00:06:58,913
will never work out.

88
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,553
I never intended marriage with her.

89
00:07:02,920 --> 00:07:04,192
My heart may harbor affection,

90
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:05,713
but it is bound by duty.

91
00:07:06,859 --> 00:07:09,612
I can only cherish the cause, not hope for the result.

92
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:21,759
Time to get going.

93
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:31,993
Aren't you going to ask me?

94
00:07:33,639 --> 00:07:34,639
Ask what?

95
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:36,312
Where I'm off to.

96
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:40,113
May I ask where you are going?

97
00:07:42,079 --> 00:07:43,632
I have an appointment with another man.

98
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:50,840
Well then...

99
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:52,720
Come home early.

100
00:07:56,480 --> 00:07:57,632
I'll come home.

101
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:25,968
(Mei Residence)

102
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:27,679
On the night of the new moon,

103
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,119
demons roam,

104
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:30,559
spirits and monsters stir,

105
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:31,993
and strange tides of chaos rise.

106
00:08:34,759 --> 00:08:36,713
Why does it have to be the new moon?

107
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:40,833
Why are you even studying that book?

108
00:08:42,759 --> 00:08:44,353
What, I'm not allowed to enjoy books?

109
00:08:44,879 --> 00:08:47,113
I thought you mortals were terrified of all that.

110
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:49,392
True.

111
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:51,200
But not entirely.

112
00:08:51,639 --> 00:08:55,073
Lady Liu is fascinated by tales of spirits and the strange.

113
00:08:55,399 --> 00:08:58,180
So just because she likes it, you have to like it too?

114
00:08:58,459 --> 00:08:59,652
What logic is that?

115
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:01,872
You don't get it.

116
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:03,353
When you like someone,

117
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:06,233
you naturally want to understand everything about them,

118
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:07,512
to share her thoughts,

119
00:09:08,039 --> 00:09:09,313
to delight in what delights her.

120
00:09:13,840 --> 00:09:14,840
Little Loach,

121
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:16,512
why don't you explain it to me?

122
00:09:19,919 --> 00:09:21,392
How about I call you "Big Brother"?

123
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:23,559
Just tell me.

124
00:09:23,639 --> 00:09:25,473
I just want to know if what this book says is true.

125
00:09:27,880 --> 00:09:30,546
I get it. You're just a young snake demon.

126
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:32,713
You haven't been around long enough to know these things.

127
00:09:32,799 --> 00:09:34,953
White Serpent here surely knows more than you.

128
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:37,719
The new moon night is nothing new to me.

129
00:09:37,799 --> 00:09:39,193
When the moon doesn't show,

130
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,473
the yin energy is at its peak,

131
00:09:40,799 --> 00:09:43,353
and energy of evil spirits and malignant forces is at its strongest.

132
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,000
That's why demons often choose to duel

133
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:47,599
on the new moon night.

134
00:09:47,679 --> 00:09:48,959
The winds would howl with power,

135
00:09:49,039 --> 00:09:50,433
and strange visions would follow.

136
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:55,233
I see.

137
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,313
But you're all demons.

138
00:09:58,799 --> 00:10:01,433
Why would you fight and kill your own kind?

139
00:10:01,653 --> 00:10:03,106
Demons are no different from humans.

140
00:10:03,233 --> 00:10:05,792
We have desires, and dark thoughts grow from them.

141
00:10:07,526 --> 00:10:10,806
Do you know we black serpents have another name?

142
00:10:14,960 --> 00:10:16,152
Worm?

143
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:18,360
Watch it now!

144
00:10:18,639 --> 00:10:19,672
It's Rain Dragon!

145
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:22,643
A black serpent who cultivates for a century can ascend to become one.

146
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,880
We command rains and summon thunder, gather the winds and clouds.

147
00:10:24,960 --> 00:10:26,719
We reign invincible beneath the heavens.

148
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:29,433
And I've cultivated for over 100 years.

149
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:33,874
You're over a hundred years old?

150
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,559
For a snake that old, you're awfully small.

151
00:10:36,639 --> 00:10:38,032
Have you not been eating well?

152
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:44,672
I... I mean,

153
00:10:45,240 --> 00:10:47,152
why haven't you turned into a dragon yet?

154
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:50,313
Because before the black serpent ascends into dragonhood,

155
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:52,713
it's at its weakest.

156
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,390
On the night of the new moon, demons roam,

157
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:00,073
spirits and monsters stir, and strange tides of chaos rise.

158
00:11:00,399 --> 00:11:01,632
But strip away the spectacle,

159
00:11:01,759 --> 00:11:04,032
it's just the same ancient law that's ruled our world for eons.

160
00:11:04,960 --> 00:11:07,513
The strong devour the weak, the victor becomes king.

161
00:11:08,799 --> 00:11:10,193
Another new moon is here.

162
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:13,392
I wonder who will prove strong enough

163
00:11:13,599 --> 00:11:15,600
and rule above all.

164
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:47,473
Elder Grey has cultivated for a millennium.

165
00:11:47,759 --> 00:11:50,233
Cat Lord has barely cultivated for over a decade.

166
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,872
The outcome is obvious to all.

167
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,473
Not necessarily.

168
00:11:55,840 --> 00:11:57,473
Cat Lord may still be young,

169
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,433
but she carries the true power of the Cat Lord.

170
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:01,512
If she can fully master it,

171
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:03,872
the fight might not be so one-sided.

172
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,200
In your opinion, my lord,

173
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:07,233
does our Cat Lord stand a chance?

174
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:06,792
A mere 18 years.

175
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:08,993
You are hopelessly outmatched.

176
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:19,832
That old rat has lost his mind!

177
00:17:19,983 --> 00:17:21,742
He actually tore open the barrier to channel the heavens' power!

178
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,592
Even if he wins, he'll be punished for this!

179
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:24,720
Are you stupid?

180
00:17:24,799 --> 00:17:27,366
If he really beats the Demon Lord, who else can enforce any rules on him?

181
00:17:35,480 --> 00:17:36,993
How dare you tear open the barrier.

182
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,674
You violated our most sacred law.

183
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,560
So what if I did?

184
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:46,633
Just to defeat me,

185
00:17:47,652 --> 00:17:49,680
you'd throw the Demon City and the mortal realm into chaos,

186
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:54,354
A temporary chaos is nothing.

187
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:58,193
As long as I can get rid of you, it's worth it.

188
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,433
The strong rule.

189
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:03,359
There's no place in the world

190
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,680
for a half-human, half-demon abomination like you!

191
00:18:21,599 --> 00:18:22,792
That was really scary.

192
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:24,512
It's over, it's over! Cat Lord must be...

193
00:19:24,599 --> 00:19:25,640
Is Cat Lord alright?

194
00:19:25,720 --> 00:19:26,993
It's ending so soon.

195
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:28,673
I can't watch!

196
00:19:31,119 --> 00:19:32,119
It's no use.

197
00:19:32,359 --> 00:19:33,359
Until a victor is decided,

198
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,032
no one can break the Deathmatch.

199
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:53,720
Zhen!

200
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:01,200
Are you alright?

201
00:22:38,759 --> 00:22:41,032
Yes! Yes!

202
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,993
Cat Lord won!

203
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:48,200
How is this possible?

204
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:52,272
You've cultivated only 18 years.

205
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:54,960
Elder Gray.

206
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,512
You worship strength

207
00:22:59,079 --> 00:23:01,393
only because you believe yourself strong.

208
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,512
But has it ever occurred to you,

209
00:23:04,319 --> 00:23:07,953
one day you too will fall to someone stronger?

210
00:23:09,680 --> 00:23:11,233
As you are now,

211
00:23:12,559 --> 00:23:14,272
when your life is in my hands.

212
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:17,032
Tell me, would you still cheer

213
00:23:17,240 --> 00:23:19,272
for the rule of the strong?

214
00:23:28,079 --> 00:23:29,079
Zhen!

215
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:36,873
You were right about one thing.

216
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:39,713
The demon world belongs to the strong.

217
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:41,673
But to be a ruler

218
00:23:42,079 --> 00:23:45,193
is not to revel in slaughter or clutch power for yourself.

219
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:48,354
It is to safeguard both the mortals and demon realms,

220
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:51,233
to shield the smallest and weakest lives

221
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:54,193
from being crushed by those who would prey on them.

222
00:23:58,400 --> 00:23:59,400
Cat Lord.

223
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,253
Elder Jin, what more do you have to say now?

224
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:09,592
Elder Grey breached the barrier between the mortal and demon realms.

225
00:24:09,839 --> 00:24:11,512
That is a crime deserving death.

226
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:14,233
Still, he's old now.

227
00:24:14,519 --> 00:24:15,519
That's right.

228
00:24:16,000 --> 00:24:17,792
Since the founding of the Demon City,

229
00:24:17,880 --> 00:24:19,673
he has faithfully served under the first Two Lords.

230
00:24:20,160 --> 00:24:21,752
He has shown nothing but loyalty.

231
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:23,873
Loyal service is its own merit.

232
00:24:25,039 --> 00:24:26,039
My lord,

233
00:24:26,279 --> 00:24:29,393
in light of his centuries of service,

234
00:24:30,119 --> 00:24:31,800
please spare his life for this one moment's lapse

235
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:33,953
in judgment.

236
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:46,640
Me?

237
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,479
I have no strong opinion.

238
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:50,272
Please spare him then.

239
00:24:51,759 --> 00:24:54,600
Letting him live is simple enough.

240
00:24:56,480 --> 00:24:58,312
I shall strip away his thousand years of cultivation.

241
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:00,953
Leave only his shell, and exile him to the mortal world.

242
00:25:03,400 --> 00:25:05,993
Since you're so obsessed with strength and weakness,

243
00:25:06,839 --> 00:25:09,272
your sentence is to live as a lowly rat.

244
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,960
Learn well the suffering of the weak.

245
00:25:28,279 --> 00:25:29,673
Come on, Elder Gray.

246
00:25:36,193 --> 00:25:39,360
Elders, any objections to this judgment?

247
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:44,433
We obey your command, my lord.

248
00:25:56,640 --> 00:25:57,640
Are you alright?

249
00:25:58,319 --> 00:25:59,480
How are you holding up?

250
00:26:01,839 --> 00:26:02,839
I'm fine.

251
00:26:08,119 --> 00:26:09,433
Good thing you didn't die.

252
00:26:10,519 --> 00:26:11,633
Oh? You couldn't bear to lose me?

253
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:13,752
No.

254
00:26:15,079 --> 00:26:16,199
I just regret what I said before.

255
00:26:16,833 --> 00:26:18,106
I was being reckless

256
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,313
for vowing to avenge you if you died.

257
00:26:22,826 --> 00:26:24,813
Elder Gray is an ancient demon from my grandfather's era.

258
00:26:25,160 --> 00:26:26,592
He fought with real skill.

259
00:26:31,480 --> 00:26:33,193
You certainly made a name for yourself.

260
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:35,752
Problem is, the demon realm came out the worse for it.

261
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:37,960
After this fight,

262
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,794
we'll have even more messes to clean up.

263
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:43,792
Elder Gray broke the barrier.

264
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:45,953
That will keep us busy for a while.

265
00:26:46,800 --> 00:26:48,313
I've sent Zhu Ying to inspect it.

266
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:51,473
We'll find out just how badly the barrier has been damaged.

267
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:56,473
Zhen, your half-demon body was unstable to begin with.

268
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,112
After such a battle,

269
00:26:58,519 --> 00:27:00,153
you should come to my place and rest first.

270
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:02,393
I need to get home.

271
00:27:02,920 --> 00:27:04,552
Look at yourself. Surely that can wait.

272
00:27:05,599 --> 00:27:06,993
I have to keep my word.

273
00:27:35,119 --> 00:27:36,953
You're still up, Mr. Mei.

274
00:27:39,599 --> 00:27:40,792
I'm waiting for Lady Wu.

275
00:27:41,279 --> 00:27:42,993
It's nearly midnight.

276
00:27:43,456 --> 00:27:44,480
She hasn't returned.

277
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:45,720
I'm a little worried.

278
00:27:53,519 --> 00:27:55,080
There's no need for concern, Mr. Mei.

279
00:27:55,160 --> 00:27:57,920
Young Lady has always been a free spirit. She often stays out late.

280
00:27:58,000 --> 00:27:59,840
Sometimes she even stays overnight at Ruyi Pavilion

281
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,126
and doesn't return until morning.

282
00:28:01,359 --> 00:28:02,832
But before she left,

283
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:04,433
she said she would be back tonight.

284
00:28:10,200 --> 00:28:11,200
I...

285
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:12,920
I'll wait a while longer.

286
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:14,352
I don't know why,

287
00:28:15,119 --> 00:28:16,713
but I have a bad feeling about this.

288
00:28:16,839 --> 00:28:17,959
You're overthinking it, sir.

289
00:28:18,039 --> 00:28:19,716
There isn't a soul in all of Chang'an

290
00:28:19,796 --> 00:28:21,473
who could get the better of Young Lady.

291
00:28:33,759 --> 00:28:34,792
Ming Zhuang,

292
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:37,479
isn't Commissioner Mei just worrying over nothing?

293
00:28:37,559 --> 00:28:38,993
Nothing?

294
00:28:39,079 --> 00:28:40,400
Just look at him,

295
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:42,766
doesn't he look just like the "wife-waiting husband" from the tales?

296
00:28:43,319 --> 00:28:44,552
Mind your manners.

297
00:28:44,759 --> 00:28:46,832
Don't forget he's our guest.

298
00:28:47,119 --> 00:28:48,119
If you ask me,

299
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:51,112
this guest is about to become the master of the house.

300
00:29:07,319 --> 00:29:08,752
Dropping in on someone at this hour...

301
00:29:09,119 --> 00:29:10,312
I hope he doesn't find me rude.

302
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:27,180
What are you doing here at this hour?

303
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:38,519
Waiting for you to come home.

304
00:29:48,680 --> 00:29:50,112
Good thing I came back, then.

305
00:29:57,839 --> 00:29:58,839
What happened to you?

306
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:03,953
I got into a fight.

307
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:07,519
I'm exhausted.

308
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:10,473
Why were you fighting again?

309
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:20,272
I don't like getting entangled with people.

310
00:30:23,039 --> 00:30:24,039
The things you say

311
00:30:24,599 --> 00:30:26,153
always sound so hard to believe.

312
00:30:27,119 --> 00:30:28,352
It's true.

313
00:30:30,119 --> 00:30:31,873
He was too old for my taste.

314
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,673
I prefer...

315
00:30:36,240 --> 00:30:37,913
A younger man.

316
00:30:45,920 --> 00:30:47,272
Is your leg better?

317
00:30:48,519 --> 00:30:49,552
It's much better.

318
00:30:52,359 --> 00:30:55,032
You should have no trouble taking me back then.

319
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,240
Lady Wu...

320
00:31:28,160 --> 00:31:29,832
Perhaps you should get up first.

321
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:35,993
It wouldn't look proper if someone saw us.

322
00:33:06,559 --> 00:33:08,120
Se... Tenth Brother!

323
00:33:08,200 --> 00:33:09,272
What are you doing?

324
00:33:09,359 --> 00:33:10,473
What are you doing here?

325
00:33:10,599 --> 00:33:11,599
I...

326
00:33:37,880 --> 00:33:39,366
What are you doing here at this hour?

327
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:40,953
I had to see you.

328
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:42,200
Don't worry, Tenth Brother.

329
00:33:42,480 --> 00:33:43,519
I know it's late.

330
00:33:43,599 --> 00:33:45,640
That's why I climbed over the wall instead of knocking

331
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:47,112
So no one could accuse me of being rude.

332
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,240
Why were you looking for me?

333
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:51,433
Nothing urgent, really.

334
00:33:51,720 --> 00:33:53,312
I just remembered something.

335
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,120
Go on.

336
00:33:55,519 --> 00:33:56,792
The morning of the Lantern Festival,

337
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:58,120
I ran into Mei Si.

338
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:00,966
He said he saw a shadowy figure that looked like a demon.

339
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:03,873
I thought it sounded ridiculous at the time.

340
00:34:04,519 --> 00:34:05,832
And now, thinking back,

341
00:34:06,160 --> 00:34:07,413
do you think there's something to it?

342
00:34:08,360 --> 00:34:10,592
Well, better safe than sorry.

343
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,232
Honestly though, I didn't sense any demonic aura back then.

344
00:34:16,559 --> 00:34:17,712
Then, did you notice

345
00:34:18,280 --> 00:34:20,112
anything strange about the sky tonight?

346
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,320
Strange?

347
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:24,679
Was there?

348
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:26,079
I didn't see it.

349
00:34:27,867 --> 00:34:29,886
Never mind. Go home.

350
00:34:30,040 --> 00:34:31,112
We'll look into it tomorrow.

351
00:34:31,480 --> 00:34:33,913
Alright! Finally, some real work to do!

352
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:38,753
The door is that way.

353
00:34:39,079 --> 00:34:40,873
Don't go climbing over people's walls again.

354
00:34:41,400 --> 00:34:42,400
Understood!

355
00:35:19,400 --> 00:35:20,400
Lady Liu.

356
00:35:22,000 --> 00:35:23,000
It's so late.

357
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,672
Are you just coming back, or about to go out?

358
00:35:26,599 --> 00:35:27,833
What are you doing here?

359
00:35:37,039 --> 00:35:38,519
It's the night of the new moon.

360
00:35:38,599 --> 00:35:40,793
The energy of evil spirits and malignant forces is at its peak.

361
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:43,753
I was worried for your safety, so I came to keep watch.

362
00:35:44,199 --> 00:35:45,873
You've been keeping watch half the night?

363
00:35:47,840 --> 00:35:50,552
Not exactly. I dozed off just now.

364
00:35:51,039 --> 00:35:53,353
I'm fine. You can go home now.

365
00:35:54,400 --> 00:35:55,632
If someone sees you here,

366
00:35:56,559 --> 00:35:57,853
they'll start spreading rumors again.

367
00:35:58,239 --> 00:36:00,833
Since you're safe, I'll leave then.

368
00:36:20,159 --> 00:36:21,159
By the way...

369
00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:29,200
Yes, Lady Liu?

370
00:36:29,400 --> 00:36:32,913
About the energy of evil spirits is at its peak on new moon night,

371
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:34,320
how did you know that?

372
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:38,913
White Serpent wrote about it in the Compendium of Demons.

373
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,913
If you're interested, I can lend it to you.

374
00:36:42,159 --> 00:36:44,873
No need. I was only asking.

375
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:57,112
I'm really going now.

376
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,200
Did I really write it like that?

377
00:39:02,599 --> 00:39:03,753
Such potent resentment.

378
00:39:07,880 --> 00:39:08,880
The Undecaying Bone.

379
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:11,453
So the demonic chaos was caused by the Undecaying Bone.

380
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:13,079
Mei Zhu Yu!

381
00:39:14,159 --> 00:39:15,159
Mei Zhu Yu?

382
00:39:15,559 --> 00:39:16,559
Mr. Mei?

383
00:39:19,559 --> 00:39:20,559
What's going on?

384
00:39:20,840 --> 00:39:23,232
Why does she look like me?

385
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:26,953
Celestial Master,

386
00:39:27,519 --> 00:39:29,072
if you spare me,

387
00:39:29,880 --> 00:39:32,559
I will tell you the secret of the woman who travels with you.

388
00:39:32,639 --> 00:39:33,672
Since it's a secret,

389
00:39:34,760 --> 00:39:35,999
you should keep it

390
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:38,112
and let it be buried along with your life.

391
00:39:51,320 --> 00:39:53,873
Heavenly fire had suddenly fallen upon Chang'an.

392
00:39:54,400 --> 00:39:56,473
It could not be doused with water, and its source was unknown.

393
00:39:58,119 --> 00:39:59,273
When yamen investigated,

394
00:39:59,559 --> 00:40:02,833
several citizens claimed they had seen demonic shadows fleeing the scene.

395
00:40:04,519 --> 00:40:08,512
Legends of a Demon City have persisted in Chang'an since ancient times.

396
00:40:14,519 --> 00:40:15,793
Demons, evil spirits,

397
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:17,473
monsters and fiends

398
00:40:18,760 --> 00:40:20,480
must all be hunted down

399
00:40:21,288 --> 00:40:23,080
and eradicated.
