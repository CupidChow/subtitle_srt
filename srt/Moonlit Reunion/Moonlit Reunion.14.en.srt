00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,016
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,097 --> 00:01:33,800
(Episode 14)

3
00:01:56,244 --> 00:01:58,518
The taste of Wushi Powder is inexplicable.

4
00:01:59,228 --> 00:02:01,661
Most of the people yesterday were spouting nonsense.

5
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,864
Some said they encountered demons

6
00:02:02,888 --> 00:02:04,343
while some said they were in a deity's realm.

7
00:02:04,367 --> 00:02:06,040
There were all kinds of ridiculous explanations.

8
00:02:06,064 --> 00:02:07,424
In my opinion, achieving deityhood

9
00:02:07,462 --> 00:02:10,102
is not as fun as enjoying ourselves in the Liu District for three days.

10
00:02:10,126 --> 00:02:11,559
I agree.

11
00:02:11,647 --> 00:02:14,604
Chang'an is where the emperor lives. It has plenty of Yang energy.

12
00:02:14,687 --> 00:02:16,823
- How could there be any spirits or demons? - Indeed.

13
00:02:16,847 --> 00:02:18,380
Deputy Commander Huang, I'm not lying.

14
00:02:18,460 --> 00:02:19,758
I did see someone using Wushi Powder yesterday.

15
00:02:19,782 --> 00:02:21,974
So, you still went to Yunong House, huh?

16
00:02:22,406 --> 00:02:23,879
I...

17
00:02:24,927 --> 00:02:26,040
It's not what you think.

18
00:02:26,687 --> 00:02:29,487
To behold the elegance of Chang'an, one has to visit the Liu District.

19
00:02:29,527 --> 00:02:34,119
You only had eyes for Wushi Powder when temptations were everywhere.

20
00:02:36,207 --> 00:02:39,839
Commissioner Mei's cousin is extraordinary indeed.

21
00:02:40,367 --> 00:02:43,999
But it isn't that easy to find Wushi Powder lying around...

22
00:02:54,406 --> 00:02:55,719
This is Wushi Powder.

23
00:02:56,207 --> 00:02:57,213
Search the area!

24
00:02:57,606 --> 00:02:58,721
Don't fall behind!

25
00:03:01,606 --> 00:03:04,080
My lord, Cat Lord's plan was quite brilliant.

26
00:03:04,207 --> 00:03:05,640
Now, everyone is saying

27
00:03:05,846 --> 00:03:08,363
that the owner of Yunong House abused the use of Wushi Powder.

28
00:03:08,446 --> 00:03:11,343
They said that he accidentally poured the powder into their water source.

29
00:03:11,367 --> 00:03:14,760
That's why many people started hallucinating upon drinking the water.

30
00:03:14,927 --> 00:03:17,999
Kitty's feint attack is quite effective.

31
00:03:18,846 --> 00:03:20,319
Now, not only is the venue seized,

32
00:03:21,006 --> 00:03:24,200
but the rumors related to demons are also dispelled through it.

33
00:03:24,446 --> 00:03:27,520
It seems this turmoil has already passed.

34
00:03:29,006 --> 00:03:30,279
Lady Liu, what a coincidence.

35
00:03:33,087 --> 00:03:34,767
Fourth Master Si, what are you doing here?

36
00:03:35,886 --> 00:03:39,480
I heard about the demonic hallucinations that occurred at the Liu District.

37
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:41,119
I came here to verify it.

38
00:03:41,406 --> 00:03:43,406
But no one expected the source to be Wushi Powder.

39
00:03:44,606 --> 00:03:47,839
Fourth Master Mei, why would you come all the way to verify it?

40
00:03:48,527 --> 00:03:51,724
I am reading the Compendium of Demons written by White Serpent.

41
00:03:51,957 --> 00:03:53,289
In the postscript,

42
00:03:53,726 --> 00:03:57,080
it stated that White Serpent wrote the book for his beloved.

43
00:04:00,087 --> 00:04:04,252
I thought that he was meticulous and interesting.

44
00:04:04,446 --> 00:04:07,200
I wanted to learn from him.

45
00:04:09,247 --> 00:04:11,367
Fourth Master Mei, how do you plan to learn from him?

46
00:04:12,207 --> 00:04:14,279
You see, my hobby is drawing.

47
00:04:14,566 --> 00:04:17,724
I wish to collect the tales of the supernatural

48
00:04:17,807 --> 00:04:19,447
and turn them into an illustrated volume.

49
00:04:19,526 --> 00:04:21,519
This way, it'll become a unique gift.

50
00:04:21,687 --> 00:04:26,480
If I give it to Lady Liu, I'm sure she'll like it.

51
00:04:27,006 --> 00:04:28,048
Let's go.

52
00:04:28,559 --> 00:04:29,620
Lady Liu?

53
00:04:35,167 --> 00:04:38,920
But my lord, White Serpent is interesting indeed.

54
00:04:45,847 --> 00:04:47,439
Lady Liu wasn't glaring at me just now.

55
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:51,040
I'm sure she likes my idea.

56
00:05:24,607 --> 00:05:28,680
Young man, they said my peaches weren't good this year.

57
00:05:29,047 --> 00:05:30,644
You should buy them elsewhere.

58
00:05:30,727 --> 00:05:32,600
You should buy them from him.

59
00:05:32,966 --> 00:05:34,019
It doesn't matter.

60
00:05:34,487 --> 00:05:36,280
Old mister, I would like to buy some.

61
00:05:42,847 --> 00:05:43,999
Are these peaches delicious?

62
00:06:11,526 --> 00:06:15,119
Young man, young lady, I'm sorry about this.

63
00:06:15,206 --> 00:06:16,683
I'm old now.

64
00:06:16,766 --> 00:06:19,119
My sense of taste has deteriorated.

65
00:06:19,727 --> 00:06:21,959
Is it sour?

66
00:06:22,886 --> 00:06:23,956
It is.

67
00:06:32,727 --> 00:06:33,805
It doesn't matter.

68
00:06:33,886 --> 00:06:35,119
I like them sour.

69
00:06:36,086 --> 00:06:37,639
Why do you like them sour?

70
00:06:38,247 --> 00:06:40,959
At my childhood home, there was a peach tree that bloomed early.

71
00:06:41,287 --> 00:06:43,519
Its fruits were small and had a harsh taste.

72
00:06:44,326 --> 00:06:45,726
They were much more sour than this.

73
00:06:46,326 --> 00:06:48,400
But I looked forward to its bloom every year.

74
00:06:48,646 --> 00:06:52,800
It's because no one else liked its fruit. They were all mine.

75
00:06:56,247 --> 00:06:58,062
Young man, it's rare for someone to like my peaches.

76
00:06:58,086 --> 00:07:00,644
Here you go. Have a few more.

77
00:07:00,727 --> 00:07:02,199
- Okay. - Have a few more.

78
00:07:02,727 --> 00:07:06,164
Listen, it's hard to grow a peach tree.

79
00:07:06,247 --> 00:07:08,604
When overripe, it's bitter and harsh.

80
00:07:08,687 --> 00:07:10,280
When unripe, it's sour.

81
00:07:12,367 --> 00:07:15,840
Its period of excellence is far too brief.

82
00:07:20,407 --> 00:07:21,423
Thank you, old mister.

83
00:07:34,247 --> 00:07:37,247
I hear that the summer blossoms of the Western Hills will soon be in bloom.

84
00:07:37,646 --> 00:07:39,119
Let's check it out in two days.

85
00:07:40,687 --> 00:07:41,726
Sure.

86
00:07:47,966 --> 00:07:50,439
Zhu Yu instructed me to leave the city and buy a horse, huh?

87
00:07:51,766 --> 00:07:53,406
Seems like he has finally figured it out.

88
00:07:53,446 --> 00:07:56,160
I wonder if he has found a way to deal with the Demon Market.

89
00:07:58,247 --> 00:07:59,959
It's fine even if he hasn't.

90
00:08:00,105 --> 00:08:01,840
He'll still be a good disciple of Changyi Palace

91
00:08:01,864 --> 00:08:03,702
as long as he stays away from that vixen.

92
00:08:03,847 --> 00:08:04,920
Master Shuang Jiang.

93
00:08:05,569 --> 00:08:06,695
Lady Hu Zhu?

94
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:09,759
Master Shuang Jiang, what are you doing at Ruyi Pavilion?

95
00:08:10,086 --> 00:08:11,720
I came here for a meal.

96
00:08:35,767 --> 00:08:38,239
Sir, are you here to drink or spectate the performance?

97
00:08:40,527 --> 00:08:42,239
I'm booking an entire table.

98
00:08:46,276 --> 00:08:48,870
Lady Hu Zhu, you told me before.

99
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:52,207
You said this is enough money for me to hold a banquet at your place.

100
00:08:56,167 --> 00:08:57,719
Wait, you...

101
00:09:00,127 --> 00:09:01,199
Sir, over here, please.

102
00:09:02,446 --> 00:09:03,483
Let's go.

103
00:09:14,807 --> 00:09:16,520
Lady Hu Zhu, you weren't lying.

104
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:23,697
Eat up.

105
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:33,884
What's the matter?

106
00:09:34,566 --> 00:09:37,000
Is the food here not delicious?

107
00:09:38,127 --> 00:09:39,319
That's not it.

108
00:09:40,726 --> 00:09:44,120
Actually, I have something else to do besides having a meal here.

109
00:09:44,407 --> 00:09:46,400
I have to make a trip to South Street later.

110
00:09:46,712 --> 00:09:48,989
This late? Why are you heading to South Street?

111
00:09:49,127 --> 00:09:50,719
Brother Mei told me to buy a horse.

112
00:09:51,366 --> 00:09:52,434
Buy a horse?

113
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:56,561
Has Mr. Mei made it big? Does he no longer need to ride a donkey?

114
00:09:56,727 --> 00:09:57,880
We need it for the trip.

115
00:09:58,206 --> 00:09:59,300
For the trip?

116
00:10:00,086 --> 00:10:02,680
We can return to Quzhou faster if we have an excellent horse.

117
00:10:04,566 --> 00:10:06,000
Are you returning to Quzhou?

118
00:10:08,558 --> 00:10:09,599
That's right.

119
00:10:10,086 --> 00:10:13,319
I came here to bid you farewell as well.

120
00:10:15,767 --> 00:10:16,927
Fate has brought us together.

121
00:10:17,007 --> 00:10:19,687
But we may not know when we'll meet again after we part ways today.

122
00:10:19,807 --> 00:10:22,007
Lady Hu Zhu, take care.

123
00:10:24,246 --> 00:10:25,840
- Master Shuang Jiang. - Lady Hu Zhu.

124
00:10:26,606 --> 00:10:27,719
You and I are best friends.

125
00:10:27,846 --> 00:10:30,127
I know you're reluctant to part with me. I feel the same.

126
00:10:30,527 --> 00:10:33,599
But I have my own missions to accomplish.

127
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:37,000
I just wanted to tell you that no one sells horses at South Street.

128
00:10:37,326 --> 00:10:39,839
You have to head to North Street to buy one.

129
00:10:43,527 --> 00:10:44,719
Thank you, Lady Hu Zhu.

130
00:10:51,127 --> 00:10:52,719
With that tiny piece of silver,

131
00:10:52,966 --> 00:10:55,160
he can't even afford the liquor.

132
00:10:55,807 --> 00:10:56,811
Indeed.

133
00:11:01,206 --> 00:11:02,959
Lady Hu Zhu, since you're this wealthy,

134
00:11:04,007 --> 00:11:06,327
why don't you settle the payment for the fragrances first?

135
00:11:10,167 --> 00:11:11,175
Is this enough?

136
00:11:13,647 --> 00:11:14,869
I suppose it is.

137
00:11:15,012 --> 00:11:19,000
But obviously, you were more generous toward Shuang Jiang.

138
00:11:19,167 --> 00:11:20,319
You're so nosy.

139
00:11:21,527 --> 00:11:25,319
Mr. Mei's cousin had to perform on the street just to get by.

140
00:11:25,647 --> 00:11:28,079
You're a 100-year-old demon. Don't compare yourself to him.

141
00:11:33,606 --> 00:11:35,880
Shopkeeper, we've distributed all the fragrances.

142
00:11:40,846 --> 00:11:44,599
Shopkeeper, that's top-quality Suhe Fragrance.

143
00:11:45,446 --> 00:11:47,040
Since when did we lower the price?

144
00:11:49,527 --> 00:11:50,559
You're so nosy.

145
00:11:52,527 --> 00:11:53,839
But it's not enough.

146
00:12:01,726 --> 00:12:03,573
It seems that you've resolved the "huge deal" in a short period.

147
00:12:03,597 --> 00:12:06,750
What's the matter, Master Shuang Jiang? Does your life belong to me now?

148
00:12:07,647 --> 00:12:10,599
So, Brother Mei bought a horse just for the carriage?

149
00:12:10,702 --> 00:12:11,724
That's right.

150
00:12:11,805 --> 00:12:14,163
Lady Wu Zhen's carriage attracts too much attention.

151
00:12:14,246 --> 00:12:16,406
Therefore, Mr. Mei brought a carriage here personally.

152
00:12:16,726 --> 00:12:18,000
Isn't he thoughtful?

153
00:12:21,767 --> 00:12:24,559
What is Brother Mei thinking? I thought he wanted to leave.

154
00:12:25,407 --> 00:12:27,127
Why did he come here to admire the flowers?

155
00:12:54,726 --> 00:12:56,281
According to the storybooks,

156
00:12:56,488 --> 00:12:58,800
men will pick flowers and present them to their spouses.

157
00:12:59,780 --> 00:13:01,693
Those storybooks are nothing special.

158
00:13:02,272 --> 00:13:04,592
Some women do present their husbands with flowers as well.

159
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:05,997
I was too narrow-minded.

160
00:13:07,206 --> 00:13:09,760
It'd be the same as last time if you brought your donkey here.

161
00:13:10,887 --> 00:13:11,946
Last time?

162
00:13:13,007 --> 00:13:15,559
You mean the trip to the western suburbs?

163
00:13:16,326 --> 00:13:18,040
Actually, I once dreamed about you.

164
00:13:19,326 --> 00:13:20,446
What did I do in your dream?

165
00:13:22,047 --> 00:13:23,359
You behaved indecently.

166
00:13:38,127 --> 00:13:42,479
I was wondering why you acted strangely ever since that incident.

167
00:13:45,047 --> 00:13:47,400
It's fine as long as we return to reality.

168
00:13:53,326 --> 00:13:54,370
That vixen.

169
00:13:56,486 --> 00:13:57,512
What did you say?

170
00:13:58,007 --> 00:13:59,880
Lady Wu Zhen is truly a vixen.

171
00:14:01,486 --> 00:14:04,640
Master Shuang Jiang, you can insult her if you like.

172
00:14:04,966 --> 00:14:07,479
But can you please insult her using another term next time?

173
00:14:07,767 --> 00:14:09,359
Stop calling her a vixen!

174
00:14:09,446 --> 00:14:11,559
Is there a term more accurate than "vixen," then?

175
00:14:15,846 --> 00:14:18,023
- What are you doing? - I'm angry at the sight of you!

176
00:14:18,047 --> 00:14:19,071
Scram!

177
00:14:27,887 --> 00:14:29,863
It's a shame that the blooming period will end soon.

178
00:14:29,887 --> 00:14:31,439
If only there were a way

179
00:14:32,767 --> 00:14:35,120
for the flowers to bloom all year long.

180
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:38,142
The seasons change with time.

181
00:14:38,222 --> 00:14:40,222
Different flowers have different blooming periods.

182
00:14:40,591 --> 00:14:42,231
Even if we can cast spells to alter them,

183
00:14:42,299 --> 00:14:44,150
we shouldn't go against the law of nature.

184
00:15:02,486 --> 00:15:03,520
What are you smiling at?

185
00:15:04,086 --> 00:15:05,966
I was reminded of a cat at Duke Wu's Residence.

186
00:15:06,455 --> 00:15:07,566
Which one?

187
00:15:08,606 --> 00:15:10,839
A striped cat.

188
00:15:11,606 --> 00:15:12,621
Aren't you afraid of it?

189
00:15:14,127 --> 00:15:18,160
It's very friendly. It has an affinity with me.

190
00:15:23,647 --> 00:15:25,079
I don't think it was just kind.

191
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:28,046
It just cherishes good-looking individuals.

192
00:15:29,206 --> 00:15:31,199
I'm sure it likes you because of your good looks.

193
00:15:32,007 --> 00:15:33,239
Just like me.

194
00:15:58,927 --> 00:16:02,839
(Did you forget? Disciples of Changyi Palace cannot fall in love!)

195
00:16:11,407 --> 00:16:12,479
This is inappropriate.

196
00:16:15,366 --> 00:16:18,880
Mr. Mei, sometimes, you don't need to stick to the rules.

197
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:26,844
I think I've almost fully recovered.

198
00:16:26,927 --> 00:16:28,800
It's time for me to leave Duke Wu's Residence.

199
00:16:29,687 --> 00:16:30,818
Are you leaving?

200
00:16:31,486 --> 00:16:32,513
That's right.

201
00:16:32,966 --> 00:16:34,025
What about me?

202
00:16:35,913 --> 00:16:36,932
What did you say?

203
00:16:43,566 --> 00:16:46,000
Don't you have anything else to tell me?

204
00:16:56,446 --> 00:16:57,488
You may leave if you like.

205
00:16:57,966 --> 00:16:59,439
I can't just force you to stay.

206
00:17:00,127 --> 00:17:03,439
Mr. Mei, you're noble and untainted. You wish to keep a distance from me.

207
00:17:04,087 --> 00:17:05,687
If so, I should know what's good for me.

208
00:17:17,927 --> 00:17:18,954
Let's go.

209
00:17:28,966 --> 00:17:33,439
Brother Mei, the carriage they took was yours, right?

210
00:17:35,327 --> 00:17:38,080
It's getting late. We should hurry back to the city.

211
00:17:39,167 --> 00:17:41,560
We don't have a carriage or a horse.

212
00:17:41,887 --> 00:17:42,920
But we have legs.

213
00:17:44,167 --> 00:17:45,199
Carry our belongings.

214
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:08,006
(Mei Residence)

215
00:18:15,847 --> 00:18:16,921
Fourth Master Si?

216
00:18:19,567 --> 00:18:21,127
Why haven't you delivered his meal yet?

217
00:18:22,394 --> 00:18:24,907
Master, for some reason,

218
00:18:25,087 --> 00:18:26,880
Fourth Master Si locked his door.

219
00:18:27,127 --> 00:18:28,195
He locked his door?

220
00:18:46,887 --> 00:18:49,279
I knew it. You're a disgrace.

221
00:18:50,464 --> 00:18:51,744
- Master! - Get out of my way!

222
00:18:53,607 --> 00:18:54,643
Get up!

223
00:18:55,367 --> 00:18:56,413
Get up!

224
00:19:10,966 --> 00:19:13,439
If you were up to something good,

225
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:17,279
why did you...

226
00:19:17,407 --> 00:19:18,452
Thank you.

227
00:19:18,607 --> 00:19:20,199
Why did you lock the door?

228
00:19:22,246 --> 00:19:23,293
Father.

229
00:19:23,726 --> 00:19:26,120
I was influenced by you all these years.

230
00:19:26,327 --> 00:19:28,186
That's why I've decided to turn over a new leaf

231
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:30,203
and devote all my time to my studies.

232
00:19:30,766 --> 00:19:33,519
But I was worried that you might worry about my health.

233
00:19:36,927 --> 00:19:39,999
Who are you trying to deceive with your fancy words?

234
00:19:40,847 --> 00:19:43,564
I can forgive you for being obsessed with drawing in the past.

235
00:19:43,684 --> 00:19:44,921
But now?

236
00:19:45,001 --> 00:19:48,936
You picked up cockfighting, dog handling, and playing with mud loaches!

237
00:19:50,327 --> 00:19:53,039
Father, it's not a mud loach.

238
00:19:54,246 --> 00:19:56,006
You're telling me that it isn't a mud loach?

239
00:19:56,887 --> 00:19:59,847
It can't be the reincarnation of Wen Chang, the God of Literature, can it?

240
00:20:01,158 --> 00:20:02,252
Indeed.

241
00:20:02,847 --> 00:20:04,519
It's the reincarnation of Wen Chang.

242
00:20:07,887 --> 00:20:08,901
Father.

243
00:20:09,327 --> 00:20:14,360
I've gone to great lengths to procure it.

244
00:20:14,687 --> 00:20:17,320
With it, I'll surely pass the imperial exam this year.

245
00:20:17,847 --> 00:20:20,047
It can even write. Take a look if you don't believe me.

246
00:20:25,446 --> 00:20:28,163
Since it's the reincarnation of Wen Chang, of course it can write.

247
00:20:28,246 --> 00:20:29,723
It can surely write.

248
00:20:29,806 --> 00:20:31,044
It can write.

249
00:20:31,127 --> 00:20:32,195
It...

250
00:20:40,806 --> 00:20:41,813
It's...

251
00:20:43,766 --> 00:20:46,160
It's the reincarnation of Wen Chang indeed!

252
00:20:46,486 --> 00:20:47,515
Look!

253
00:20:49,006 --> 00:20:51,199
It's the character, "Wen."

254
00:20:52,206 --> 00:20:54,199
Father, how could you tell?

255
00:20:56,806 --> 00:20:57,869
Look.

256
00:21:00,766 --> 00:21:01,920
Deities above,

257
00:21:02,087 --> 00:21:05,080
I would gladly present gold along with the full sacrificial offerings

258
00:21:05,486 --> 00:21:07,640
to build your divine statue.

259
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,161
- Please bless my son! - Father.

260
00:21:09,185 --> 00:21:10,265
Return the mud loach to me.

261
00:21:10,333 --> 00:21:12,053
- Make sure he passes the exam! - Father.

262
00:21:12,246 --> 00:21:15,160
Please make sure my son passes the imperial exam!

263
00:21:20,327 --> 00:21:24,560
If you truly had feelings for him, you didn't need to rush things.

264
00:21:24,806 --> 00:21:26,623
You could've made him stay for a few more days.

265
00:21:26,647 --> 00:21:28,407
You should at least enjoy it while it lasts.

266
00:21:28,887 --> 00:21:30,120
Our relationship is ambiguous.

267
00:21:30,327 --> 00:21:31,439
That's no fun at all.

268
00:21:31,927 --> 00:21:33,799
He never thought of taking it up a notch.

269
00:21:34,766 --> 00:21:35,799
That means

270
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:39,640
I'm not that important to him.

271
00:21:40,407 --> 00:21:41,680
This is a rare sight.

272
00:21:42,687 --> 00:21:45,719
Lady Wu Zhen is actually fretting about her relationship for once.

273
00:21:48,367 --> 00:21:50,727
You should at least let me wallow in sorrow for a few days.

274
00:21:50,847 --> 00:21:51,860
Deal.

275
00:21:52,927 --> 00:21:55,688
I'll arrange for some courtesans and entertainers to perform for you.

276
00:21:55,887 --> 00:21:57,123
You'll surely enjoy it.

277
00:21:57,206 --> 00:21:59,126
By then, you'll forget about that heartless man.

278
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:01,934
Okay?

279
00:22:32,436 --> 00:22:34,669
We should spend the night here.

280
00:22:39,407 --> 00:22:40,437
Let's have a meal first.

281
00:22:44,740 --> 00:22:45,933
Please enjoy your meal.

282
00:22:57,006 --> 00:22:59,006
Guys, over here, please.

283
00:23:05,806 --> 00:23:08,443
Are you two stopping for a meal or looking to stay the night?

284
00:23:08,526 --> 00:23:10,640
Two rooms and two bowls of Yangchun noodles.

285
00:23:10,927 --> 00:23:13,920
We also want chicken with scallions in vinegar, stir-fried okra with pork,

286
00:23:14,327 --> 00:23:16,206
winter amaranth greens, celery in vinegar dressing,

287
00:23:16,230 --> 00:23:17,512
mutton with broth,

288
00:23:19,023 --> 00:23:20,085
and Hu-style flatbread.

289
00:23:20,206 --> 00:23:21,880
Can you finish all of them?

290
00:23:22,087 --> 00:23:24,439
You don't need to know. I can afford them.

291
00:23:25,486 --> 00:23:26,526
Please prepare them.

292
00:23:36,647 --> 00:23:40,560
Brother Mei, don't you think there's something wrong with him?

293
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:42,806
He's wearing such thick clothing during the summer.

294
00:23:42,966 --> 00:23:44,486
I'm sweating just from looking at him.

295
00:23:46,167 --> 00:23:47,719
Do not gossip about other people.

296
00:23:49,607 --> 00:23:50,840
This is your room card.

297
00:23:51,127 --> 00:23:52,135
Please keep it.

298
00:23:59,286 --> 00:24:01,719
Since you ordered that much food, you have to exercise.

299
00:24:01,927 --> 00:24:04,160
Place our belongings in the room.

300
00:24:05,327 --> 00:24:06,420
Okay.

301
00:24:51,407 --> 00:24:54,244
Guys, are you stopping for a meal or looking to stay the night?

302
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,565
Can't you tell?

303
00:24:56,087 --> 00:24:57,141
Just look at us!

304
00:24:58,806 --> 00:25:01,120
This is a robbery!

305
00:25:01,327 --> 00:25:02,439
A robbery!

306
00:25:44,327 --> 00:25:46,080
Mister, you're generous, aren't you?

307
00:25:49,127 --> 00:25:50,309
Don't come near me.

308
00:25:58,127 --> 00:26:00,160
Who said you could tell me what to do?

309
00:26:00,687 --> 00:26:02,239
Do you think you're a deity?

310
00:26:04,887 --> 00:26:05,920
How dare you still laugh?

311
00:26:06,087 --> 00:26:07,880
- Pay up. - Pay up!

312
00:26:08,887 --> 00:26:09,950
No.

313
00:26:10,726 --> 00:26:12,847
What's wrong? Do you refuse to pay up?

314
00:26:14,607 --> 00:26:17,439
I do not have any money with me.

315
00:26:21,046 --> 00:26:22,880
Look at what you're wearing.

316
00:26:23,526 --> 00:26:26,326
You're saying that you didn't bring any money with you on a trip, huh?

317
00:26:30,206 --> 00:26:31,519
That's impossible.

318
00:26:33,887 --> 00:26:36,479
I did bring some money with me, but it's in the room.

319
00:26:36,607 --> 00:26:39,044
Why don't I take you to my room?

320
00:26:39,127 --> 00:26:40,183
No need for that.

321
00:26:41,046 --> 00:26:43,239
Do you think this is my first day being a robber?

322
00:26:43,766 --> 00:26:47,199
I've seen plenty of fair-skinned smart alecs like you.

323
00:26:47,407 --> 00:26:48,687
Do you think you can deceive me?

324
00:26:48,806 --> 00:26:49,814
Er!

325
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:18,927
Have you found his luggage sack?

326
00:27:29,647 --> 00:27:32,087
San, Si, head to the 2nd floor.

327
00:27:32,407 --> 00:27:33,443
Yes, Boss!

328
00:27:55,327 --> 00:27:57,160
Where are you two? Reply to me!

329
00:27:58,526 --> 00:28:00,325
As the saying goes, the pit of greed can never be filled.

330
00:28:00,349 --> 00:28:02,743
It seems our predecessors were speaking the truth.

331
00:28:08,006 --> 00:28:10,279
Is your room a man-eating entity?

332
00:28:11,206 --> 00:28:13,206
Why aren't there any movements from my underlings?

333
00:28:13,806 --> 00:28:15,246
Why don't you check it out yourself?

334
00:28:15,496 --> 00:28:16,505
I...

335
00:28:16,613 --> 00:28:19,245
If not, you'll fall behind, you know?

336
00:28:28,206 --> 00:28:29,880
Where's the last guy?

337
00:28:30,127 --> 00:28:32,127
He's still here. He's the smartest among them all.

338
00:28:38,607 --> 00:28:39,700
Waiter.

339
00:28:43,486 --> 00:28:44,726
Report this to the authorities.

340
00:28:56,847 --> 00:28:57,876
Hurry!

341
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:00,837
Move!

342
00:29:02,327 --> 00:29:04,120
- Move! - How dare you stare at me?

343
00:29:12,486 --> 00:29:13,505
Mister.

344
00:29:18,351 --> 00:29:19,570
(Pei Ji Ya)

345
00:29:19,653 --> 00:29:21,766
I'm Pei Ji Ya from Kunzhou.

346
00:29:21,894 --> 00:29:23,526
Thank you for the assistance.

347
00:29:24,052 --> 00:29:25,766
May I know your names?

348
00:29:25,847 --> 00:29:26,999
I'm Mei Zhu Yu.

349
00:29:27,327 --> 00:29:29,039
This is my little brother, Shuang Jiang.

350
00:29:29,407 --> 00:29:30,623
Please don't stand on ceremony.

351
00:29:30,647 --> 00:29:32,999
I did it to save myself as well.

352
00:29:34,127 --> 00:29:35,999
One's kindness should be repaid somehow.

353
00:29:36,246 --> 00:29:38,199
Have you two had dinner yet?

354
00:29:38,367 --> 00:29:40,400
Why don't I treat you two to a meal as thanks?

355
00:29:43,806 --> 00:29:45,760
Brother Mei, why don't we...

356
00:29:49,847 --> 00:29:50,878
Thank you.

357
00:29:51,246 --> 00:29:52,266
Please.

358
00:30:23,806 --> 00:30:27,131
Mr. Shuang Jiang, you may ask me any questions if you still have any.

359
00:30:29,567 --> 00:30:32,400
What's with the thick clothing?

360
00:30:35,687 --> 00:30:36,767
I...

361
00:30:37,726 --> 00:30:38,731
I'm ill.

362
00:30:40,446 --> 00:30:41,526
I was born with an ailment.

363
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:46,199
I had a weak constitution since young. I couldn't even withstand sunlight.

364
00:30:46,806 --> 00:30:49,719
I have to put on extra layers even during the height of summer.

365
00:30:51,647 --> 00:30:52,880
Poor guy.

366
00:30:53,766 --> 00:30:55,840
Mr. Shuang Jiang, what's your next question?

367
00:30:57,486 --> 00:30:58,494
That's all.

368
00:31:04,446 --> 00:31:06,840
Mei, I was honored to witness your valiant actions.

369
00:31:07,087 --> 00:31:08,920
You were both brave and witty.

370
00:31:09,046 --> 00:31:11,039
Words cannot express my gratitude to you.

371
00:31:11,966 --> 00:31:13,279
I cannot take alcohol.

372
00:31:15,246 --> 00:31:16,606
Brother Mei doesn't like to drink.

373
00:31:16,847 --> 00:31:18,080
Mr. Mei, I'll drink with you.

374
00:31:19,726 --> 00:31:21,326
I'll offer you a toast with tea instead.

375
00:31:29,327 --> 00:31:30,847
Mr. Mei, you seem weary from the road.

376
00:31:30,966 --> 00:31:32,360
Did you just return from Chang'an?

377
00:31:32,486 --> 00:31:34,086
Indeed. I just left Chang'an for a trip.

378
00:31:34,446 --> 00:31:35,532
I'm so envious.

379
00:31:36,327 --> 00:31:38,199
I grew up in Chang'an.

380
00:31:38,607 --> 00:31:40,519
I had to leave the place due to family affairs.

381
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:42,647
Now, I'm living in Kunzhou.

382
00:31:43,647 --> 00:31:45,527
It's been many years since I've returned there.

383
00:31:45,806 --> 00:31:49,320
I heard that Chang'an is much more peaceful now.

384
00:31:49,726 --> 00:31:51,719
Every realm has its own rules now.

385
00:31:53,887 --> 00:31:56,039
Mr. Mei, what do you mean by "realm?"

386
00:31:59,647 --> 00:32:04,080
I mean, every realm of the officialdom.

387
00:32:29,087 --> 00:32:30,199
Mr. Mei, please pardon me.

388
00:32:30,446 --> 00:32:32,920
My hobby is to cultivate fragrances.

389
00:32:33,167 --> 00:32:34,880
I'm quite sensitive to smell.

390
00:32:35,327 --> 00:32:38,360
Speaking of which, the scent you're giving out

391
00:32:38,726 --> 00:32:40,246
is quite interesting to say the least.

392
00:32:40,927 --> 00:32:42,106
It's interesting.

393
00:32:42,968 --> 00:32:44,075
What do you smell?

394
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:48,039
I smell newly cured leather.

395
00:32:49,607 --> 00:32:51,080
Did you get a new saddle?

396
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:52,719
How did you know?

397
00:32:53,167 --> 00:32:55,425
I also smell a faint scent of medicinal herbs

398
00:32:55,505 --> 00:32:57,439
like mugwort and cinnamon twigs.

399
00:33:00,246 --> 00:33:02,479
Were you injured not long ago?

400
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:03,880
You could tell from that?

401
00:33:05,966 --> 00:33:07,119
There's also

402
00:33:10,167 --> 00:33:11,479
a hint of womanly presence.

403
00:33:13,167 --> 00:33:14,170
This...

404
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:15,840
That's a joke.

405
00:33:17,526 --> 00:33:19,439
Mr. Mei, you're handsome and talented.

406
00:33:19,607 --> 00:33:21,479
I assume you've won the hearts of many ladies.

407
00:33:21,887 --> 00:33:23,047
That's why I was teasing you.

408
00:33:46,567 --> 00:33:47,681
Speaking of ladies,

409
00:33:48,806 --> 00:33:50,680
I'm reminded of my childhood sweetheart.

410
00:33:51,726 --> 00:33:54,519
When I was young, I had a weak constitution.

411
00:33:54,887 --> 00:33:58,120
Outsiders would avoid me if they could.

412
00:33:59,206 --> 00:34:01,880
She was the only one who treated me differently.

413
00:34:03,607 --> 00:34:06,479
We were kindred spirits who had feelings for each other.

414
00:34:07,127 --> 00:34:11,319
Sadly, things rarely turn out the way one hopes.

415
00:34:11,766 --> 00:34:14,120
My family migrated to Kunzhou.

416
00:34:14,886 --> 00:34:18,120
We were forced to part with each other.

417
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:24,080
I've suffered a lot

418
00:34:26,406 --> 00:34:27,686
due to this old ailment of mine.

419
00:34:28,687 --> 00:34:29,724
But I could endure it

420
00:34:31,647 --> 00:34:32,879
no matter how tough it was.

421
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:36,799
I remember that the only time I cried

422
00:34:38,047 --> 00:34:39,199
was because of her.

423
00:34:40,447 --> 00:34:43,319
In the past, my health wasn't the best.

424
00:34:44,047 --> 00:34:47,680
Even if I fancied her, I didn't dare to propose to her.

425
00:34:48,367 --> 00:34:49,428
Now,

426
00:34:50,527 --> 00:34:51,847
my health is gradually improving.

427
00:34:52,047 --> 00:34:53,927
That's why I'm rushing to Chang'an immediately.

428
00:34:54,167 --> 00:34:56,480
This time, I won't let her down.

429
00:34:57,726 --> 00:35:00,063
Pei, you're heading all the way to Chang'an just to find your beloved.

430
00:35:00,087 --> 00:35:01,967
Your devotion to her

431
00:35:03,926 --> 00:35:05,199
is truly touching.

432
00:35:06,087 --> 00:35:08,799
Mr. Mei, what about you? Do you have someone you fancy?

433
00:35:11,806 --> 00:35:12,856
I do.

434
00:35:13,206 --> 00:35:15,600
Can you tell us your story?

435
00:35:16,326 --> 00:35:18,526
In life, it's natural for one to be foolish about love.

436
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:22,640
It's just that she and I aren't meant for each other.

437
00:35:29,926 --> 00:35:31,000
I see.

438
00:35:31,366 --> 00:35:33,839
Mr. Mei, it seems you have a transcendent view.

439
00:35:34,087 --> 00:35:36,520
But I'm just a commoner.

440
00:35:37,886 --> 00:35:42,640
I merely wish to marry her and grow old together with her.

441
00:35:48,326 --> 00:35:50,719
Mr. Mei, aren't you going to give me your blessing?

442
00:35:57,607 --> 00:36:00,080
Far in body, yet ever close in spirit.

443
00:36:00,406 --> 00:36:02,242
If you two are sincere toward each other,

444
00:36:02,322 --> 00:36:04,120
a happy ending can surely be achieved.

445
00:36:04,846 --> 00:36:06,000
Thank you, Mr. Mei.

446
00:36:21,886 --> 00:36:24,440
This is the fullest meal I've had in recent days.

447
00:36:25,406 --> 00:36:26,960
Mr. Pei is quite nice, huh?

448
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:28,767
Brother Mei, what do you think?

449
00:36:30,007 --> 00:36:31,075
He's strange.

450
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:32,520
Strange?

451
00:36:33,174 --> 00:36:34,354
What's so strange?

452
00:36:35,246 --> 00:36:37,761
I feel that he's being too familiar with us

453
00:36:37,841 --> 00:36:39,759
despite our shallow acquaintance.

454
00:36:42,567 --> 00:36:45,160
Although Mr. Pei looks weak and sickly,

455
00:36:45,487 --> 00:36:46,843
he's quite passionate.

456
00:36:46,926 --> 00:36:48,480
I think he's just talkative.

457
00:36:48,846 --> 00:36:49,846
Perhaps so.

458
00:36:52,806 --> 00:36:54,406
- What's wrong? - Nothing.

459
00:36:54,886 --> 00:36:56,319
I think I ate too much just now.

460
00:36:56,766 --> 00:36:58,120
I'll be fine after some rest.

461
00:37:05,447 --> 00:37:06,528
Show me your hand.

462
00:37:13,886 --> 00:37:16,199
How is it? It's nothing serious, isn't it?

463
00:37:17,567 --> 00:37:20,319
Judging from your pulse, it's a stomachache.

464
00:37:22,246 --> 00:37:23,280
Okay.

465
00:37:24,766 --> 00:37:27,126
(But why do I feel like there's a hint of poison in there?)

466
00:37:28,087 --> 00:37:29,680
Come, let's seek out a physician.

467
00:37:31,167 --> 00:37:32,282
What's the matter?

468
00:37:34,527 --> 00:37:35,666
Sir, please take care.

469
00:37:49,687 --> 00:37:51,206
Young Master, it's locked.

470
00:37:52,487 --> 00:37:55,399
That Mei fellow is quite cautious, isn't he?

471
00:38:40,246 --> 00:38:42,319
Have you dealt with the authorities?

472
00:38:42,567 --> 00:38:43,719
We've bribed them.

473
00:38:44,087 --> 00:38:47,199
The robbers will be released in a few days.

474
00:38:47,366 --> 00:38:50,600
This plan is perfect. Young Master, there's no need to worry.

475
00:38:51,726 --> 00:38:54,600
Young Master, I only found the luggage sack of the big guy in the room.

476
00:38:55,007 --> 00:38:56,120
Should we inspect it?

477
00:38:56,406 --> 00:38:59,440
No need for that. I'm uninterested in him.

478
00:38:59,687 --> 00:39:01,600
Young Master, I don't understand.

479
00:39:01,886 --> 00:39:03,879
Your goal was to poison Mei Zhu Yu.

480
00:39:04,206 --> 00:39:06,246
Why was Shuang Jiang the only one who was poisoned?

481
00:39:06,926 --> 00:39:08,643
I laced the fragrance with poison.

482
00:39:08,726 --> 00:39:10,806
The poison requires alcohol and food to take effect.

483
00:39:11,206 --> 00:39:15,640
But Mei Zhu Yu didn't drink or eat just now. Therefore, it didn't work.

484
00:39:15,967 --> 00:39:17,160
I see.

485
00:39:17,527 --> 00:39:19,382
That Mei fellow was obstructing your progress again.

486
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:22,719
In my opinion, we should've made the dose lethal and taken his life.

487
00:39:24,926 --> 00:39:28,640
According to my informant in Chang'an, he's no longer related to my cousin.

488
00:39:29,246 --> 00:39:31,759
He's just a loser. Why should I take his life?

489
00:39:32,246 --> 00:39:34,759
Besides, I'm a kind person.

490
00:39:35,007 --> 00:39:36,279
Young Master, you're right.

491
00:39:37,246 --> 00:39:39,399
Forget it. At least I've seen him for myself.

492
00:39:39,806 --> 00:39:42,960
I've found out about my cousin's preference for men.

493
00:40:23,966 --> 00:40:24,968
Let's go.

494
00:40:25,366 --> 00:40:26,760
Time to head to Chang'an.
