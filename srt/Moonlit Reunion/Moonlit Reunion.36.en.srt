00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,096
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,248 --> 00:01:33,960
(Episode 36)

3
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:04,480
(The Mei's Tea House)

4
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,063
Zhu Yu.

5
00:04:42,199 --> 00:04:43,262
Mother.

6
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:46,262
Zhu Yu.

7
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,663
Mother.

8
00:04:52,399 --> 00:04:53,485
Zhu Yu.

9
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:39,543
Mother.

10
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,063
Mother.

11
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:02,005
What happened to my mother?

12
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:11,183
It's fine.

13
00:06:11,399 --> 00:06:12,462
Zhu Yu.

14
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:17,846
Everything will pass.

15
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,887
(Former Cat Lord)

16
00:08:38,480 --> 00:08:39,543
Who are you?

17
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:54,486
Father!

18
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:09,694
(I didn't expect)

19
00:09:10,159 --> 00:09:11,406
(Father to be the Cat Lord.)

20
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,023
(It's even more surprising)

21
00:09:13,240 --> 00:09:15,565
(that this is the truth of what happened 18 years ago.)

22
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:49,702
Boss!

23
00:11:01,368 --> 00:11:02,431
Lady Wu Zhen.

24
00:11:03,159 --> 00:11:04,160
You are awake.

25
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:05,303
Where is he?

26
00:11:17,039 --> 00:11:20,006
It seems like Lady Wu Zhen has recovered.

27
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:23,366
Are all of you gathering here

28
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,286
to wait for me?

29
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:27,605
I...

30
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:32,006
Lady Wu Zhen, please let him examine you.

31
00:11:49,480 --> 00:11:51,046
Lady Wu Zhen has finally recovered.

32
00:11:51,399 --> 00:11:54,166
Changxi Palace is capable indeed.

33
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:56,286
You could even treat the demonic ulcers.

34
00:11:57,440 --> 00:11:59,079
I should thank you...

35
00:11:59,159 --> 00:12:00,925
It's not really Changxi Palace's contribution.

36
00:12:01,399 --> 00:12:03,565
It's because you are blessed, Lady Wu Zhen.

37
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:09,486
We invited Lady Hu Zhu

38
00:12:09,840 --> 00:12:10,965
but we didn't expect you

39
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,006
to be asleep for three whole days, Lady Wu Zhen.

40
00:12:14,480 --> 00:12:16,126
He has helped me a lot.

41
00:12:17,159 --> 00:12:18,646
I should thank him in person.

42
00:12:23,879 --> 00:12:25,006
Brother Mei knew

43
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:27,845
your memory would return.

44
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,126
He was afraid that you might hate him when you woke up.

45
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:34,725
He said he knew what was best for him

46
00:12:35,159 --> 00:12:36,445
so he left.

47
00:12:41,600 --> 00:12:42,663
Lady Wu Zhen.

48
00:12:50,799 --> 00:12:53,246
Lady Wu Zhen, please wait.

49
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:36,445
I heard you came to this archive

50
00:13:36,720 --> 00:13:38,046
when you lost your memory.

51
00:13:38,109 --> 00:13:40,631
You joked and said you wanted to learn both the ways of Taoists and Demons.

52
00:13:41,947 --> 00:13:44,832
This Changxi Heart Calming Manual can be used to calm one's heart.

53
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:47,325
It won't conflict with demonic powers.

54
00:13:47,864 --> 00:13:49,824
Lady Wu Zhen, you just recovered

55
00:13:49,921 --> 00:13:51,421
and need to regulate your body internally.

56
00:13:51,679 --> 00:13:54,006
This might be able to help you.

57
00:14:01,159 --> 00:14:02,222
Thank you.

58
00:14:12,039 --> 00:14:13,766
Read and learn slowly.

59
00:15:30,799 --> 00:15:32,805
Is that ugly thing yours?

60
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:35,286
I won against Brother Xiao Mu once.

61
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:38,766
Master made this clay doll for me

62
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:40,582
as a reward.

63
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:44,406
Now that I look at it closely, it's quite cute.

64
00:15:55,159 --> 00:15:56,845
Since Lady Hu Zhu came here,

65
00:15:56,926 --> 00:15:58,950
you haven't had time to take a good look around this place.

66
00:15:59,159 --> 00:16:00,479
Now that Boss is awake,

67
00:16:00,559 --> 00:16:01,925
I'm very happy.

68
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:05,366
I think Changxi Palace is on par with Demon City.

69
00:16:05,799 --> 00:16:08,046
Have you been doing well recently?

70
00:16:11,159 --> 00:16:12,565
When Boss wasn't around,

71
00:16:12,769 --> 00:16:14,246
I was busy at Demon City.

72
00:16:14,799 --> 00:16:16,965
I neglected matters at Ruyi Pavilion.

73
00:16:17,240 --> 00:16:19,725
Revenue has dropped a lot in the last two weeks.

74
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:21,845
Business at Ruyi Pavilion is good.

75
00:16:22,064 --> 00:16:23,442
A small loss isn't anything important.

76
00:16:23,559 --> 00:16:24,622
What do you mean?

77
00:16:24,759 --> 00:16:27,006
I'm going to be the richest person in Chang'an.

78
00:16:27,200 --> 00:16:29,685
It hurts me to lose even a coin.

79
00:16:29,907 --> 00:16:32,234
Yes. You are right, Lady Hu Zhu.

80
00:16:32,879 --> 00:16:33,965
When it comes to making money,

81
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:35,845
Lady Wu Zhu is the best.

82
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,542
You are ambitious.

83
00:16:38,623 --> 00:16:40,375
I'm sure your wish can be fulfilled, Lady Hu Zhu.

84
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:43,646
I wonder if you will become a great hero

85
00:16:43,711 --> 00:16:46,089
when I become the richest person in Chang'an, Master Shuang Jiang.

86
00:16:47,399 --> 00:16:48,486
I...

87
00:16:48,919 --> 00:16:49,982
I'll do my best.

88
00:16:51,480 --> 00:16:52,805
You're lacking in confidence.

89
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:56,640
Actually, I know.

90
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,526
I joined Changxi Palace the latest among the members

91
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:01,085
and my cultivation is only average.

92
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:04,565
Becoming a great hero

93
00:17:05,079 --> 00:17:07,805
is just a pipe dream.

94
00:17:08,920 --> 00:17:10,526
However, I will always imagine

95
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:12,726
that it will happen one day.

96
00:17:13,912 --> 00:17:16,397
I want to be a great hero who's free and unrestrained,

97
00:17:16,619 --> 00:17:18,747
brave enough to love and hate, and help everyone in the world.

98
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,885
A cultivator must first cultivate his heart.

99
00:17:41,759 --> 00:17:43,766
Since you have the intention,

100
00:17:44,160 --> 00:17:46,640
just do it according to your wish.

101
00:17:46,720 --> 00:17:48,325
Ignore what others think.

102
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,605
There's nothing to worry about.

103
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,303
Thank you for your guidance.

104
00:17:54,759 --> 00:17:56,966
In that case, why don't I give you a gift?

105
00:18:03,559 --> 00:18:04,622
What is it?

106
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:09,463
Is this

107
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,023
gold?

108
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,360
Looking at the color, it looks like gold from the previous dynasty.

109
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:17,503
You are sharp.

110
00:18:17,599 --> 00:18:20,286
However, you should take a closer look, Lady Hu Zhu.

111
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:28,303
A gold spirit?

112
00:18:29,039 --> 00:18:30,102
During the war,

113
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:31,600
rich families from the previous dynasty

114
00:18:31,680 --> 00:18:33,246
buried their treasures in the mountains.

115
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,679
Sometimes, they forget where they buried them

116
00:18:35,759 --> 00:18:37,926
and they turn into spirits after a long time.

117
00:18:38,319 --> 00:18:40,783
Two days ago, I found it when I was checking the accounts.

118
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,486
It is good at hiding.

119
00:18:46,079 --> 00:18:48,102
Stand up. Stand up.

120
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,463
Stand up!

121
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:52,085
Don't bully it.

122
00:18:54,160 --> 00:18:55,246
My gold!

123
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,805
- Over here.   - Come back, my gold!

124
00:19:33,599 --> 00:19:34,766
(How did I...)

125
00:19:36,920 --> 00:19:38,645
Lady Wu Zhen, you picked it up.

126
00:19:39,552 --> 00:19:41,318
This guy is playing dead again.

127
00:19:41,410 --> 00:19:44,353
Boss, this isn't a gold ingot. It is a gold spirit.

128
00:19:44,434 --> 00:19:46,530
Shuang Jiang is giving it to us to bring back to Demon City.

129
00:19:49,839 --> 00:19:51,880
Lady Hu Zhu, remember to teach him a lesson

130
00:19:51,960 --> 00:19:53,605
when you return to Demon City.

131
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:56,023
I understand.

132
00:20:02,079 --> 00:20:03,142
Boss.

133
00:20:03,519 --> 00:20:05,046
Have you packed your bags?

134
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,006
We should leave now.

135
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,605
I've disturbed all of you for so long.

136
00:20:24,839 --> 00:20:26,486
There's no need to be polite, Lady Wu Zhen.

137
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,263
Let's go.

138
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:52,703
Boss.

139
00:20:53,079 --> 00:20:54,805
Why aren't we waiting for Mr. Mei?

140
00:20:55,799 --> 00:20:58,966
I think we have something more important to do.

141
00:22:02,640 --> 00:22:06,046
Snakes in the city! Be careful when you're in your residences!

142
00:22:06,839 --> 00:22:08,446
Young Lady, take a look at this basket.

143
00:22:08,599 --> 00:22:12,605
Snakes in the city! Be careful when you're in your residences!

144
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:17,365
Snakes in the city! Be careful when you're in your residences!

145
00:22:18,319 --> 00:22:22,526
Snakes in the city! Be careful when you're in your residences!

146
00:22:25,559 --> 00:22:29,165
Snakes in the city! Be careful when you're in your residences!

147
00:22:31,359 --> 00:22:32,600
It's winter.

148
00:22:32,680 --> 00:22:34,565
Why are there snakes in Chang'an?

149
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:36,320
You know nothing.

150
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:40,246
I've been chasing after a large snake to this place.

151
00:22:40,519 --> 00:22:42,239
Last night,

152
00:22:42,319 --> 00:22:43,382
it was foggy

153
00:22:43,799 --> 00:22:45,325
and I lost it.

154
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:47,279
Are you serious?

155
00:22:47,359 --> 00:22:48,526
Of course.

156
00:22:49,319 --> 00:22:50,999
If it goes into my house,

157
00:22:51,079 --> 00:22:52,239
what should I do?

158
00:22:52,319 --> 00:22:55,120
Yes. We have women and old people in our residences.

159
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,325
Everyone, calm down.

160
00:22:57,519 --> 00:23:00,239
I brought a lot of sulfur.

161
00:23:00,319 --> 00:23:03,560
All of you can burn it in your houses

162
00:23:03,640 --> 00:23:05,519
to repel snakes.

163
00:23:05,599 --> 00:23:08,400
- Do we need to pay for your sulfur?   - No.

164
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:11,246
They are for you to repel the snakes.

165
00:23:11,519 --> 00:23:13,120
- I want it.   - Give me a bag.

166
00:23:13,200 --> 00:23:14,920
- Give me a bag.   - Me too.

167
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,440
- Come and get it.   - My residence is big.

168
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:17,885
You have a big residence, take two bags.

169
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:19,325
Come here. Don't rush.

170
00:23:20,759 --> 00:23:22,405
Don't rush.

171
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:25,206
You must burn it around your residence.

172
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:41,862
Waiter!

173
00:23:43,720 --> 00:23:46,046
Fourth Master Mei, you're awake. Do you want some food?

174
00:23:46,319 --> 00:23:47,382
Sure.

175
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:50,206
Manager!

176
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,519
Why is it so noisy outside?

177
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:54,662
Is there a ghost?

178
00:23:54,960 --> 00:23:56,800
No. There's a snake.

179
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:57,943
What?

180
00:23:58,039 --> 00:23:59,102
A snake.

181
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,726
They say there are snakes in Chang'an.

182
00:24:01,880 --> 00:24:03,686
All of them are buying sulfur from the snake catcher.

183
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:07,165
It is noisy in the whole city from east to west.

184
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,479
Reasonably speaking,

185
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:09,845
it's winter now.

186
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,239
Snakes should be hibernating.

187
00:24:12,319 --> 00:24:15,160
However, burning some sulfur isn't bad.

188
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:16,920
The new year is coming soon.

189
00:24:16,997 --> 00:24:18,584
It can be used to get rid of bad luck, right?

190
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:20,046
Here you go.

191
00:24:20,359 --> 00:24:21,422
Come.

192
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:24,565
All snakes should be hibernating in winter.

193
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,463
Sulfur?

194
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,286
It's hard to breathe out here. Are you all right, Lady Liu?

195
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,405
Lady Liu! Lady Liu?

196
00:24:57,240 --> 00:24:58,279
Lady Liu!

197
00:24:58,359 --> 00:24:59,360
Stop!

198
00:24:59,440 --> 00:25:01,845
Don't stop! Return to the residence immediately!

199
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:03,766
Yes. Keep going.

200
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:25,120
Lady Liu!

201
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:26,263
The carriage is broken.

202
00:25:27,359 --> 00:25:28,526
Snake!

203
00:25:29,000 --> 00:25:30,759
- Where?   - There's a snake!

204
00:25:30,839 --> 00:25:32,006
Where's the snake?

205
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,439
Where's the snake?

206
00:25:33,519 --> 00:25:34,600
It's inside the carriage!

207
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,405
Don't just watch. Save her!

208
00:25:37,119 --> 00:25:38,766
Will Lady Liu be bitten by the snake?

209
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:40,080
Go and take a look!

210
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,239
Go and check on her!

211
00:25:41,319 --> 00:25:42,805
I'm afraid of snakes!

212
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:44,959
- Don't you know what time it is?   - Lady Liu!

213
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:46,360
Are you all right, Lady Liu?

214
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,885
Lady Liu!

215
00:25:49,119 --> 00:25:51,199
- Are you all right?   - Are you all right?

216
00:25:51,279 --> 00:25:52,342
Lady Liu!

217
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,463
Lady Liu!

218
00:25:56,519 --> 00:25:58,085
Is Lady Liu all right?

219
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:01,862
Mei Si?

220
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:47,959
Fourth Master Mei and Lady Liu.

221
00:26:48,039 --> 00:26:49,102
That's...

222
00:26:51,599 --> 00:26:53,926
Fourth Master Mei saved her.

223
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,325
Fourth Master.

224
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:31,703
Stop!

225
00:27:31,799 --> 00:27:33,365
Don't burn sulfur in the future.

226
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:34,679
But there are snakes.

227
00:27:34,759 --> 00:27:36,325
So what? I'm fine.

228
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:39,286
Keep it.

229
00:27:46,319 --> 00:27:47,766
Master Snake, move!

230
00:27:48,359 --> 00:27:49,422
What's wrong?

231
00:28:20,039 --> 00:28:22,040
Master Snake, take good care of her.

232
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,286
I'll go and get a bucket of water.

233
00:28:23,759 --> 00:28:24,822
Go.

234
00:28:38,720 --> 00:28:40,320
What do you think is going on

235
00:28:40,400 --> 00:28:41,766
between Fourth Master and Lady Liu?

236
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:45,085
They've been engaged for more than a decade after all.

237
00:28:45,240 --> 00:28:47,805
Perhaps they will finally get married.

238
00:30:03,240 --> 00:30:04,303
Are you feeling better?

239
00:30:06,079 --> 00:30:07,142
Thank you.

240
00:30:16,519 --> 00:30:17,686
I didn't expect

241
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,885
the Serpent Lord

242
00:30:20,079 --> 00:30:21,805
to be tortured by sulfur.

243
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,405
You are fine.

244
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:26,046
I got lucky and didn't leave the house.

245
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:28,862
However,

246
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:34,046
the sulfur incident

247
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,600
is a blessing in disguise for both of you.

248
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,206
Why don't you two reconcile?

249
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:55,543
You haven't recovered. You should rest here.

250
00:30:57,440 --> 00:30:59,805
I'm afraid there's something more important to do.

251
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:01,943
What is it?

252
00:31:02,680 --> 00:31:04,526
Finding out who is trying to harm me.

253
00:31:05,599 --> 00:31:06,686
Someone is trying to harm you?

254
00:31:08,384 --> 00:31:09,447
Are you saying

255
00:31:10,035 --> 00:31:11,455
that the burning of sulfur in the city

256
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,526
is planned by someone?

257
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:24,206
Even if it was a set-up by someone,

258
00:31:24,839 --> 00:31:26,526
why does he need your scales?

259
00:31:28,359 --> 00:31:29,422
I don't know.

260
00:31:30,319 --> 00:31:33,206
However, the Serpent Lord's scales cannot be left outside.

261
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:37,885
I think we can find clues very soon

262
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,805
if we investigate the snake catcher.

263
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:44,006
Only two hours have passed.

264
00:31:44,680 --> 00:31:46,085
I think it won't be difficult

265
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:47,783
to find the snake catcher.

266
00:31:53,680 --> 00:31:54,743
Talk.

267
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,645
I saw the snake catcher at the Eastern market 30 minutes ago.

268
00:31:59,559 --> 00:32:00,622
Pay him.

269
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,645
I saw him leave Liu District 10 minutes ago.

270
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:10,225
I know too! I saw him in a temple!

271
00:32:10,359 --> 00:32:13,006
Calm down!

272
00:32:13,720 --> 00:32:15,845
Enough. Take your turns.

273
00:32:26,920 --> 00:32:27,983
Snake!

274
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:29,543
Snake!

275
00:32:31,400 --> 00:32:33,766
Deity, spare me!

276
00:32:34,279 --> 00:32:38,845
- Deity!   - I heard you came to the city by following a huge snake.

277
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,046
What's going on?

278
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,342
Where's the snake?

279
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:44,605
The snake...

280
00:32:45,400 --> 00:32:46,805
I am weak

281
00:32:47,440 --> 00:32:49,246
and didn't catch any snake.

282
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,845
You are timid

283
00:32:56,319 --> 00:32:58,446
and you don't have many tools on you.

284
00:32:59,880 --> 00:33:03,365
I think you won't meet any huge snakes usually.

285
00:33:03,839 --> 00:33:07,486
You seem to be an eel or loach catcher instead.

286
00:33:08,359 --> 00:33:09,920
However, you said

287
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,805
you saw a huge snake yesterday

288
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:13,845
and followed it here.

289
00:33:15,119 --> 00:33:17,246
You also brought many sulfur with you.

290
00:33:18,599 --> 00:33:19,662
Did someone

291
00:33:20,680 --> 00:33:22,206
instruct you to do that?

292
00:33:23,079 --> 00:33:24,805
Deity, you are wise.

293
00:33:25,359 --> 00:33:26,422
Yes.

294
00:33:26,673 --> 00:33:28,032
I made up the story

295
00:33:28,119 --> 00:33:29,560
of the huge snake.

296
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:31,920
Why did you make up stories for no reason?

297
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,565
Deity, it's like this.

298
00:33:34,200 --> 00:33:35,405
You saw it.

299
00:33:35,632 --> 00:33:38,511
How could I catch a huge snake with my ability?

300
00:33:38,599 --> 00:33:39,880
I can't do it.

301
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:41,160
I'm so afraid.

302
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:45,644
So, I could only scare the people and create panic.

303
00:33:45,759 --> 00:33:49,479
After that, I would give and sell sulfur

304
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:51,165
to make some money.

305
00:33:51,319 --> 00:33:52,526
Tell me the truth!

306
00:33:53,839 --> 00:33:56,800
Deity! I'm speaking the truth.

307
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,686
I didn't lie.

308
00:34:00,880 --> 00:34:02,320
(Is he just a mortal?)

309
00:34:02,440 --> 00:34:04,125
(Is there a conspiracy behind this?)

310
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:18,846
It's you.

311
00:34:19,880 --> 00:34:20,943
You scared me.

312
00:34:21,079 --> 00:34:24,559
You asked me to distribute sulfur

313
00:34:24,639 --> 00:34:25,765
and I did it.

314
00:34:26,039 --> 00:34:27,360
Do you have any more orders?

315
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:28,503
No.

316
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,023
You may leave.

317
00:34:31,079 --> 00:34:34,085
All right. I'll be leaving.

318
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:52,765
I'm not drunk!

319
00:34:53,218 --> 00:34:54,819
- You're not drunk.   - Don't pull me.

320
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:57,039
- Slow down.   - I can hold my liquor...

321
00:34:57,119 --> 00:34:58,182
Manager.

322
00:34:58,280 --> 00:34:59,725
Where are my friends?

323
00:35:00,360 --> 00:35:01,526
I think they left.

324
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:02,903
They left?

325
00:35:03,199 --> 00:35:04,262
Where to?

326
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:07,285
I didn't see when Fourth Master Mei left.

327
00:35:07,639 --> 00:35:10,559
However, the young man looked like he was in a rush

328
00:35:10,639 --> 00:35:11,725
when he left.

329
00:35:13,760 --> 00:35:15,639
That's right, Lady Liu.

330
00:35:15,719 --> 00:35:17,526
Someone asked me to give this to you.

331
00:35:24,075 --> 00:35:26,120
(I'll wait for you in the forest)

332
00:35:28,679 --> 00:35:29,886
A demonic spell?

333
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:44,463
What is this place?

334
00:35:45,039 --> 00:35:46,102
Who tied me up?

335
00:35:47,159 --> 00:35:48,222
Who are you?

336
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,685
Did you tie me up?

337
00:35:51,480 --> 00:35:54,406
Speak! You're not a righteous man!

338
00:36:08,199 --> 00:36:09,262
Master Snake.

339
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:14,423
Master Snake!

340
00:36:17,440 --> 00:36:18,503
Xuan Hui?

341
00:36:18,719 --> 00:36:19,966
Why?

342
00:36:20,599 --> 00:36:21,725
Elder Gray?

343
00:36:22,519 --> 00:36:23,725
I should be the one asking

344
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,926
why you are still alive.

345
00:36:32,079 --> 00:36:33,142
Master Snake!

346
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,645
Evil Demon, Xuan Hui.

347
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:40,285
When did you become friends with a mortal?

348
00:36:42,679 --> 00:36:44,285
I can play with anyone I want.

349
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:46,605
Who are you to decide?

350
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:48,582
You, on the other hand,

351
00:36:49,000 --> 00:36:50,446
are acting mysterious.

352
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:52,526
What are you trying to do?

353
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:55,079
I just want to create chaos

354
00:36:55,159 --> 00:36:57,006
in Demon City.

355
00:36:59,480 --> 00:37:00,543
Xuan Hui.

356
00:37:00,679 --> 00:37:02,039
Have you forgotten

357
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:05,326
how confident you were in Demon Prison

358
00:37:05,519 --> 00:37:08,926
and how I helped you escape the place?

359
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:10,526
Right now,

360
00:37:10,760 --> 00:37:13,165
you are being friendly

361
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:14,725
and submit

362
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,645
to a useless mortal instead.

363
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,503
Elder Gray.

364
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:22,205
Whether I have a grudge or not

365
00:37:22,480 --> 00:37:23,846
is my business.

366
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:26,966
You cannot decide whether I take revenge or not.

367
00:37:27,638 --> 00:37:28,918
Back when we were in Demon Prison,

368
00:37:29,599 --> 00:37:32,165
I promised you to attack the Cat Lord

369
00:37:32,599 --> 00:37:33,639
and I did it.

370
00:37:33,719 --> 00:37:35,039
However, I didn't promise you

371
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,446
that I'd succeed.

372
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,863
As for him,

373
00:37:40,519 --> 00:37:42,326
he isn't a useless mortal.

374
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:44,685
He is my friend.

375
00:38:17,639 --> 00:38:18,702
Master Snake!

376
00:38:26,480 --> 00:38:27,605
Master Snake!

377
00:38:29,119 --> 00:38:30,182
Stop!

378
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:31,782
Stop!

379
00:38:43,199 --> 00:38:45,085
Run!

380
00:38:49,159 --> 00:38:50,886
Master Snake!

381
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:57,125
Master Snake.

382
00:40:03,800 --> 00:40:05,565
You are finally here, Serpent Lord.

383
00:40:07,079 --> 00:40:08,165
Elder Gray?

384
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:10,565
I'm sure you've put in a lot of effort

385
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,926
to be revived.

386
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,125
I'm sure you didn't do it to bully a mortal

387
00:40:16,639 --> 00:40:19,326
and a small demon that's younger than 100 years.

388
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:20,565
Me?

389
00:40:21,159 --> 00:40:23,205
I did it for you.

390
00:40:31,920 --> 00:40:32,983
Lady Liu!

391
00:40:44,719 --> 00:40:45,782
Lady Liu!

392
00:40:48,840 --> 00:40:50,326
What are you doing?

393
00:40:50,639 --> 00:40:51,926
I want

394
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:55,645
to make a deal with you, Serpent Lord.

395
00:41:03,880 --> 00:41:05,285
Go straight to the point.

396
00:41:12,039 --> 00:41:14,926
I want your scale

397
00:41:15,360 --> 00:41:17,285
in exchange for all three of your lives.

398
00:41:17,880 --> 00:41:19,120
What do you think?
