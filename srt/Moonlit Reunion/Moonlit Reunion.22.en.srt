1
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,931
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,022 --> 00:01:33,678
(Episode 22)

3
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,480
(Chang Ming)

4
00:01:47,568 --> 00:01:48,800
Sect Leader.

5
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:53,159
Zhu Yu.

6
00:01:54,959 --> 00:01:57,480
Shuang Jiang had told us all about your experience

7
00:01:57,852 --> 00:01:59,897
in the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

8
00:02:00,343 --> 00:02:01,439
After your trip to Chang'an,

9
00:02:02,243 --> 00:02:03,983
not only did you help your bureau solve mysterious cases

10
00:02:04,064 --> 00:02:05,439
and capture demons,

11
00:02:05,704 --> 00:02:07,520
but you also found the Demon City.

12
00:02:07,775 --> 00:02:09,142
You didn't let us down.

13
00:02:09,888 --> 00:02:11,080
I appreciate your effort.

14
00:02:11,375 --> 00:02:13,500
So, the Demon City does exist within Chang'an, huh?

15
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:17,880
Indeed. But I was only able to remain there briefly.

16
00:02:18,575 --> 00:02:21,822
I still have no way to enter the Demon City yet.

17
00:02:22,896 --> 00:02:25,502
You've already done a lot by yourself.

18
00:02:26,449 --> 00:02:30,416
At least we can prove that the info we've received was true.

19
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,720
But I hear that Chang'an is rife with rumors

20
00:02:33,911 --> 00:02:36,160
related to bat demons and ink tigers.

21
00:02:37,533 --> 00:02:39,979
The Demon City is filled with heinous demons indeed.

22
00:02:40,807 --> 00:02:42,374
It seems that our journey down the mountain

23
00:02:42,815 --> 00:02:44,621
is imminent.

24
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:46,886
Sect Leader, you're right.

25
00:02:47,042 --> 00:02:48,423
We need to leave our sect and vanquish the demons.

26
00:02:48,520 --> 00:02:50,200
I've prepared many anti-demon arrays.

27
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:52,239
That's right. We can't allow them to run amok again.

28
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:53,726
Let's descend the mountain and vanquish them now.

29
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:55,400
That's right.

30
00:02:55,968 --> 00:02:56,968
Everyone.

31
00:02:57,594 --> 00:03:00,200
The incident with the ink tigers has nothing to do with the Demon City.

32
00:03:00,384 --> 00:03:01,384
It was caused by men.

33
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:02,560
Men?

34
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:04,846
Zhu Yu, what are you saying?

35
00:03:05,269 --> 00:03:06,869
How could such man-made incidents summon demons?

36
00:03:07,039 --> 00:03:08,285
It was caused by men.

37
00:03:08,639 --> 00:03:10,205
Zhu Yu, what do you mean?

38
00:03:10,607 --> 00:03:11,774
Someone cultivated demonic arts.

39
00:03:12,651 --> 00:03:16,417
He commanded ink demons to summon lesser demons to gain a profit.

40
00:03:16,776 --> 00:03:18,382
I encountered him.

41
00:03:19,074 --> 00:03:20,625
Seniors, the sect decides

42
00:03:20,705 --> 00:03:22,400
whether you guys will descend the mountain or not.

43
00:03:22,775 --> 00:03:23,981
I shouldn't interfere.

44
00:03:24,538 --> 00:03:27,824
However, the Demon City isn't behind the incident with the ink tigers.

45
00:03:28,584 --> 00:03:29,720
Demonic arts?

46
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,205
Since there are no demons running amok in Chang'an,

47
00:03:35,966 --> 00:03:39,091
should we still descend the mountain?

48
00:03:42,753 --> 00:03:44,118
It seems like there's no rush.

49
00:03:44,725 --> 00:03:47,410
I can use this time to prepare more arrays just in case anything happens.

50
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:50,326
Sect Leader, what do you think?

51
00:03:51,315 --> 00:03:52,315
You're right.

52
00:03:53,103 --> 00:03:55,230
It's impossible for us to annihilate the Demon City in one day.

53
00:03:55,936 --> 00:03:57,542
Naturally, we have to plan this through.

54
00:03:57,905 --> 00:04:00,710
All right. We shall set this aside for now.

55
00:04:02,242 --> 00:04:03,487
Since Zhu Yu has returned,

56
00:04:03,872 --> 00:04:06,638
I have one more thing to discuss with you all.

57
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,125
Zhu Yu is Master's favorite disciple.

58
00:04:09,527 --> 00:04:11,614
He's naturally gifted and skilled in arcane arts.

59
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:15,006
And now, he knows the Demon City better than any of us.

60
00:04:15,344 --> 00:04:18,790
I wish to promote him to Head Administrator

61
00:04:19,296 --> 00:04:21,484
so that he can assist me in managing Changxi Palace.

62
00:04:23,972 --> 00:04:24,972
Him?

63
00:04:25,319 --> 00:04:26,319
Is he even worthy?

64
00:04:28,018 --> 00:04:29,032
Do not speak such nonsense.

65
00:04:30,229 --> 00:04:33,275
Sect Leader, I'm still inexperienced.

66
00:04:33,649 --> 00:04:36,330
Please rescind your order and appoint another candidate.

67
00:04:36,528 --> 00:04:39,488
Zhu Yu, you have concerns. I understand that.

68
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:41,173
- But I...   - Sect Leader.

69
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,995
Actually, I came back for two reasons.

70
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,652
Firstly, it's to explain the incident with the ink tigers.

71
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:48,160
Secondly, I came back

72
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,180
to receive my punishment.

73
00:04:53,921 --> 00:04:54,921
Receive punishment?

74
00:04:55,632 --> 00:04:56,632
What punishment?

75
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:59,086
Master taught me and raised me up.

76
00:04:59,633 --> 00:05:03,398
In the future, if Changxi Palace needs any help, I'll do my best to help.

77
00:05:04,656 --> 00:05:07,022
I won't forget about my mission all these years as well.

78
00:05:07,583 --> 00:05:08,583
However,

79
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:12,206
when I was living in Chang'an,

80
00:05:12,822 --> 00:05:13,909
I fell for someone.

81
00:05:15,399 --> 00:05:16,399
I had feelings for another person.

82
00:05:18,519 --> 00:05:20,206
Seniors, please grant me my wish.

83
00:05:20,759 --> 00:05:24,846
Please allow me to kick myself out of the sect and marry her.

84
00:05:25,519 --> 00:05:26,685
I wish to be with her forever.

85
00:05:50,684 --> 00:05:53,256
(Master, if you were still around,)

86
00:05:53,608 --> 00:05:57,286
(I wonder if you would be disappointed to see the current me.)

87
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:18,747
Young boy, did you desire it?

88
00:06:20,214 --> 00:06:22,439
- What do you want to do with it?   - I'll eat it.

89
00:06:22,585 --> 00:06:24,431
What did you say? Did you say you want to eat it?

90
00:06:24,624 --> 00:06:26,470
It's been so long since I had meat.

91
00:06:27,439 --> 00:06:30,405
But you captured it first.

92
00:06:30,944 --> 00:06:32,110
I suppose it's yours.

93
00:06:33,775 --> 00:06:34,775
Young boy.

94
00:06:35,979 --> 00:06:38,265
Although you're young, you do behave like a gentleman.

95
00:06:38,524 --> 00:06:42,651
Since we've met each other, I suppose fate has led us here.

96
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,726
I'll give you some guidance today.

97
00:06:49,839 --> 00:06:51,885
Brilliant spirit, revealed! All evils shall be vanquished!

98
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,040
Look. This isn't a wild chicken.

99
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,046
This is a pheasant spirit that has committed countless evils.

100
00:07:18,355 --> 00:07:19,841
You're quite bold, aren't you?

101
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:24,207
It seems you have great potential.

102
00:07:28,327 --> 00:07:29,327
Are you hungry?

103
00:07:30,409 --> 00:07:31,462
Why didn't you have your fill?

104
00:07:32,057 --> 00:07:33,702
My parents died.

105
00:07:34,239 --> 00:07:36,206
I'm living in the manor alone.

106
00:07:39,201 --> 00:07:41,168
Another orphan, huh?

107
00:07:42,337 --> 00:07:43,982
Is there no one else in the manor?

108
00:07:45,144 --> 00:07:46,243
There is.

109
00:07:47,342 --> 00:07:48,767
But...

110
00:07:48,847 --> 00:07:50,989
But no one cared about you.

111
00:07:53,724 --> 00:07:56,970
If that's the case, wouldn't it be better for you to follow me?

112
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:02,079
Consider my proposal.

113
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,086
Be my disciple, and I'll prepare roasted pheasant for you.

114
00:08:14,077 --> 00:08:17,123
Be your disciple? What's your occupation?

115
00:08:17,539 --> 00:08:19,744
You're quite the cautious kid, huh?

116
00:08:19,976 --> 00:08:22,442
I'm Si Qing, a Celestial Master of Changxi Palace.

117
00:08:23,253 --> 00:08:25,613
What does Changxi Palace do?

118
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:27,550
It's a great place.

119
00:08:27,633 --> 00:08:29,673
We exorcise demons, capture spirits, and dispel misfortunes.

120
00:08:29,791 --> 00:08:31,438
It's a place for doing good deeds.

121
00:08:36,567 --> 00:08:37,567
Master.

122
00:08:42,606 --> 00:08:43,620
(I've failed you, Master.)

123
00:08:43,982 --> 00:08:46,989
(Although I intend to practice the way of our sect,)

124
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:50,486
(I went against the sect rules as I'd fallen for someone.)

125
00:08:59,665 --> 00:09:02,072
Master, what are you eating?

126
00:09:02,648 --> 00:09:05,487
Zhu Yu, I was thinking that you would come back at this time

127
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:07,205
after your sword practice at Shuiqin.

128
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,805
This is Beggar's Chicken. It's piping hot.

129
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:13,000
Here.

130
00:09:16,984 --> 00:09:17,985
Here.

131
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:19,700
Zhu Yu, eat up.

132
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,360
What's wrong?

133
00:09:23,719 --> 00:09:25,280
I came across this the other day while reading.

134
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,886
It states that cultivators must restrain their desires for food and drink.

135
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:34,280
Strange. You were a cute boy before this.

136
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,286
But why are you getting more and more dull?

137
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:39,205
I know you're pure and have few desires.

138
00:09:39,919 --> 00:09:41,526
And, you're a talented cultivator.

139
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:44,486
But you're too obsessed with sticking to the book and rules.

140
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:45,888
What about this?

141
00:09:46,044 --> 00:09:48,723
I'll give you a lesson.

142
00:09:48,879 --> 00:09:51,480
Let me ask you this. What is the Way?

143
00:09:55,986 --> 00:09:57,720
According to the books, there's the Way of Heaven,

144
00:09:57,870 --> 00:10:00,275
the Way of Earth, and the Way of Man.

145
00:10:00,944 --> 00:10:02,549
Those are the three natural Ways.

146
00:10:03,552 --> 00:10:05,677
One attains the Way only by not contending, not seizing,

147
00:10:06,014 --> 00:10:08,700
remaining tranquil, and having a mind free of attachments.

148
00:10:09,759 --> 00:10:11,205
If so, why do you cultivate the Way yourself?

149
00:10:22,080 --> 00:10:24,006
You don't even know why you're cultivating the Way, huh?

150
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:28,171
The methods of your cultivation are, in truth, nothing but nonsense.

151
00:10:31,757 --> 00:10:33,563
Everyone has their own Way to attain.

152
00:10:34,051 --> 00:10:35,201
Take me as an example.

153
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,582
I crave roasted chicken every day.

154
00:10:38,032 --> 00:10:41,438
But will that affect me from managing Changxi Palace? It won't.

155
00:10:41,623 --> 00:10:44,070
It won't impede me from slaying demons as well.

156
00:10:47,366 --> 00:10:48,960
So,

157
00:10:49,288 --> 00:10:53,760
Master, what do you think I should do to attain the Way?

158
00:10:55,759 --> 00:10:57,246
That'll depend on yourself.

159
00:10:57,950 --> 00:10:58,950
There's no need to rush.

160
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:00,928
To attain the Way, you must first cultivate the mind.

161
00:11:01,111 --> 00:11:03,958
The Way follows nature, as one acts in accordance with one's heart.

162
00:11:04,706 --> 00:11:08,032
As for your Way, you can take your time looking for it

163
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:12,685
after finishing this roasted chicken.

164
00:11:13,679 --> 00:11:14,679
Eat up.

165
00:11:21,159 --> 00:11:22,159
It's delicious, isn't it?

166
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:24,639
Thank you, Master.

167
00:11:28,543 --> 00:11:29,653
You should eat.

168
00:11:30,039 --> 00:11:31,205
I still have some left.

169
00:11:42,679 --> 00:11:43,679
Zhu Yu.

170
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:47,725
You've never left Changxi Palace ever since you came here as a child.

171
00:11:48,667 --> 00:11:52,366
It's only human for you to be bewitched by the splendor of Chang'an.

172
00:11:53,130 --> 00:11:55,255
If you're willing to turn over a new leaf,

173
00:11:56,248 --> 00:11:58,013
I'll treat it as if nothing had happened.

174
00:12:00,225 --> 00:12:03,286
One's feelings emanate from the heart.

175
00:12:03,840 --> 00:12:05,085
How can I change it?

176
00:12:06,048 --> 00:12:07,613
Since I've already fallen for her,

177
00:12:08,303 --> 00:12:12,006
if I admit fault against my conscience today,

178
00:12:13,150 --> 00:12:15,116
when I have to face a life-or-death situation,

179
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:17,549
you would never believe

180
00:12:18,049 --> 00:12:19,774
that I would seek not to protect myself

181
00:12:20,624 --> 00:12:24,270
and abandon righteousness for survival.

182
00:12:24,734 --> 00:12:27,181
You still haven't repented even though you've knelt here for days.

183
00:12:30,167 --> 00:12:33,746
If that's the case, as the Sect Leader,

184
00:12:34,217 --> 00:12:36,543
there's no way I can defend you again.

185
00:12:38,743 --> 00:12:39,949
According to the rules of Changxi Palace,

186
00:12:40,864 --> 00:12:42,869
if one wishes to leave the sect,

187
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,005
one has to enter the White Night Array

188
00:12:45,487 --> 00:12:47,694
and be punished by the White Night Birds.

189
00:12:48,080 --> 00:12:52,285
After that, they shall be unrelated to the sect.

190
00:12:56,424 --> 00:12:57,509
Thank you, Sect Leader.

191
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:26,526
He's a traitor. We should've annulled his cultivation.

192
00:13:27,001 --> 00:13:29,366
Sect Leader, why are you still trying to defend him?

193
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,126
He's Master's favorite disciple. I've nurtured him as well.

194
00:13:34,559 --> 00:13:37,366
Who would've expected him to do such a thing?

195
00:13:37,679 --> 00:13:40,725
Since I'm the Sect Leader, I cannot practice favoritism.

196
00:13:42,919 --> 00:13:44,685
Sect Leader, you've already given him a chance.

197
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,982
Now, he's bewitched by an outsider. That's ridiculous.

198
00:13:48,120 --> 00:13:50,492
It'll be impossible to uphold proper conduct if you practice favoritism.

199
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:12,805
Are you sure Zhu Yu can do it?

200
00:14:14,080 --> 00:14:15,640
Changxi Palace has always been fair and just.

201
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:18,480
Now, Zhu Yu had confessed to his crime and insisted on leaving.

202
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,086
No one can side with him.

203
00:14:20,831 --> 00:14:23,272
But Brother Ming is...

204
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,479
Indeed. If other people were to have the same thought,

205
00:14:25,559 --> 00:14:27,400
they would've been cast into the White Night Array immediately.

206
00:14:27,618 --> 00:14:29,200
Brother Ming actually gave him a few days

207
00:14:29,301 --> 00:14:30,720
so that he could reflect upon his actions.

208
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,821
But the sect rules must be obeyed.

209
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,286
Is Zhu Yu going to...

210
00:14:38,559 --> 00:14:41,120
Don't worry. The White Night Array won't kill him.

211
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:43,325
But he'll definitely suffer.

212
00:14:45,159 --> 00:14:49,805
I’ve heard that being pierced by the White Night Birds is excruciating.

213
00:14:51,879 --> 00:14:54,486
A century ago, another disciple also wanted to leave the sect.

214
00:14:55,000 --> 00:14:57,605
After going through the punishment, his injuries never healed.

215
00:14:57,919 --> 00:15:00,725
In the end, he took his own life because of the pain.

216
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,493
This...

217
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:09,400
Tomorrow, once Zhu Yu steps into the array,

218
00:15:09,480 --> 00:15:12,092
the White Night Birds will come. They're sentient.

219
00:15:15,759 --> 00:15:18,366
Brother Lu Yang, do you have any other questions?

220
00:15:18,759 --> 00:15:19,759
No, I don't.

221
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:22,085
You've explained everything there is to it.

222
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:27,812
If so, let's head back.

223
00:15:29,399 --> 00:15:30,399
Okay.

224
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,760
Cat Lord is going to get married!

225
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,325
Cat Lord is going to get married!

226
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:22,959
Do you guys know this? Cat Lord is going to get married!

227
00:16:23,039 --> 00:16:24,840
- She's going to get married?   - To whom?

228
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:26,839
I heard that she's going to be married to a mortal.

229
00:16:26,919 --> 00:16:27,919
A mortal?

230
00:16:28,559 --> 00:16:30,486
Even Cat Lord is going to get married.

231
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,280
Even Cat Lord is going to get married.

232
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,085
When will you marry me?

233
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:48,805
Cat Lord, I heard that you were granted a marriage in the Mortal Realm.

234
00:16:49,320 --> 00:16:51,366
Is that true?

235
00:16:51,960 --> 00:16:53,406
Strange.

236
00:16:53,840 --> 00:16:55,725
You guys spend your days in the Demon City.

237
00:16:56,039 --> 00:16:58,886
Where did you receive such news from the Mortal Realm?

238
00:16:59,159 --> 00:17:01,240
The walls have ears, you know?

239
00:17:01,320 --> 00:17:06,046
I've already heard about it. You just need to answer my question.

240
00:17:07,528 --> 00:17:10,854
So what if it's true? So what if it isn't?

241
00:17:11,560 --> 00:17:13,126
I'm the one getting married here.

242
00:17:14,119 --> 00:17:15,605
What has this got to do with you all?

243
00:17:16,036 --> 00:17:19,282
Naturally, your marriage is related to the Demon Market.

244
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:24,165
No Cat Lord has gotten married to a mortal since ancient times.

245
00:17:25,136 --> 00:17:26,167
Indeed.

246
00:17:26,465 --> 00:17:28,950
Your marriage to a mortal is inappropriate.

247
00:17:29,264 --> 00:17:30,381
You mustn't do it.

248
00:17:33,144 --> 00:17:36,726
Tell me, then. What's inappropriate about it?

249
00:17:46,079 --> 00:17:48,405
Which line in this demon law states

250
00:17:48,839 --> 00:17:50,286
that the Cat Lord cannot marry?

251
00:17:52,319 --> 00:17:57,006
This has never been done since the founding of the Demon City.

252
00:17:58,245 --> 00:18:00,971
Does that mean I cannot do it?

253
00:18:04,668 --> 00:18:08,394
My lord, ever since you assumed the position of Cat Lord,

254
00:18:08,759 --> 00:18:11,206
you've always gone against everyone else.

255
00:18:11,799 --> 00:18:13,926
You always wish to blaze a new trail.

256
00:18:14,119 --> 00:18:17,565
But there's no way every attempt can yield a good result.

257
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,006
Elder Jin Men, look at what you're saying.

258
00:18:21,560 --> 00:18:24,485
It's as if you've been holding a grudge against Cat Lord for a long time.

259
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:27,799
Indeed.

260
00:18:28,440 --> 00:18:30,766
I was rude just now.

261
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:34,926
Since none of you have any objections,

262
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:37,039
- I shall...   - My lord.

263
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:39,200
I object.

264
00:18:40,579 --> 00:18:42,465
Do you not care about my opinions?

265
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:48,693
Lord Shu.

266
00:18:50,881 --> 00:18:52,566
I'll bear the responsibility for my own decisions.

267
00:18:53,680 --> 00:18:55,405
Even if it's the wrong decision, I'll take charge of it.

268
00:18:57,319 --> 00:19:00,125
No one can decide my fate for me.

269
00:19:10,567 --> 00:19:13,613
Lord Shu, perhaps you should clarify where you stand.

270
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:31,642
If so, after your marriage, will the Demon City...

271
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:34,365
Everyone, don't worry.

272
00:19:35,039 --> 00:19:38,880
The Demon City must not be spoken of to mortals. That is the rule.

273
00:19:38,960 --> 00:19:40,085
It'll be the same.

274
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:43,544
I am willing to experience what others go through

275
00:19:43,624 --> 00:19:45,206
to truly feel it for myself.

276
00:19:53,944 --> 00:19:57,564
(Duke Wu's Residence)

277
00:20:03,880 --> 00:20:04,880
Zhen.

278
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,125
Zhen, is that you?

279
00:20:15,279 --> 00:20:16,405
Zhen!

280
00:20:16,519 --> 00:20:18,246
I heard you.

281
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:21,920
What? You think you're seeing a ghost this early in the day?

282
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:24,246
So, you know that it's early morning as well, huh?

283
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:28,519
You're actually reading instead of sleeping?

284
00:20:28,599 --> 00:20:29,805
And, it's an indecent...

285
00:20:30,839 --> 00:20:31,892
Wait. It's actually a decent one.

286
00:20:33,079 --> 00:20:34,286
This is my personal experience.

287
00:20:34,759 --> 00:20:37,686
One has to read in order to lead a good life.

288
00:20:45,599 --> 00:20:47,365
Why are you sighing?

289
00:20:49,119 --> 00:20:51,966
What's Mei Zhu Yu's true intention?

290
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,246
He said he had to return to Quzhou. But why hasn't he returned yet?

291
00:20:58,133 --> 00:20:59,926
Could it be that he’s deceiving you and pretending

292
00:21:00,006 --> 00:21:01,892
to be courteous while hiding his true intentions?

293
00:21:02,054 --> 00:21:05,580
In reality, he ran away and he's never coming back.

294
00:21:08,101 --> 00:21:09,640
Pretending to be courteous and hiding one's true intention?

295
00:21:09,742 --> 00:21:12,520
That's your usual trick.

296
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:15,166
- Me?   - Did you forget

297
00:21:15,346 --> 00:21:18,400
how you used to deal with those who asked for your hand?

298
00:21:21,279 --> 00:21:22,720
Zhen.

299
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,679
It's not that I'm not confident in you.

300
00:21:25,759 --> 00:21:26,773
But you see...

301
00:21:29,960 --> 00:21:31,605
Even the master said

302
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:34,239
those who commit too many misdeeds will face retribution.

303
00:21:34,319 --> 00:21:36,206
They'll be struck by lightning!

304
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:44,325
Father, can't you be optimistic about me for once?

305
00:21:45,000 --> 00:21:46,165
He'll return.

306
00:21:48,279 --> 00:21:50,926
He said he would return in ten days.

307
00:21:51,359 --> 00:21:53,526
But today's already the 12th day.

308
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:03,440
He's right.

309
00:22:04,839 --> 00:22:06,405
It's already the 12th day.

310
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:42,526
Zhu Yu?

311
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:52,440
Zhu Yu.

312
00:22:53,165 --> 00:22:55,611
It’s all my fault. I was confined for so long.

313
00:22:55,818 --> 00:22:56,885
Only now am I being released.

314
00:22:57,419 --> 00:23:00,099
After I was released, I heard about you.

315
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:01,605
I was so flustered.

316
00:23:01,839 --> 00:23:04,486
I heard that you haven't eaten anything since you started kneeling.

317
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,693
Therefore, I brought you some buns. You should have some.

318
00:23:09,389 --> 00:23:10,389
No need for that.

319
00:23:14,079 --> 00:23:17,605
Zhu Yu, are you sure you want to leave the sect?

320
00:23:19,119 --> 00:23:22,645
Since I've broken my vow, I must make a choice.

321
00:23:23,480 --> 00:23:26,605
Moreover, she's still waiting for me.

322
00:23:28,312 --> 00:23:30,032
What's so good about that vixen?

323
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:31,885
Is she truly worth all the sacrifices you've made?

324
00:23:31,966 --> 00:23:32,966
She is.

325
00:23:36,319 --> 00:23:37,319
She's worth it.

326
00:23:38,440 --> 00:23:39,440
I don't understand at all.

327
00:23:41,960 --> 00:23:43,486
I was just like you once.

328
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:49,565
I once thought that the purpose of my life was to uncover past events

329
00:23:50,079 --> 00:23:51,325
and to slay demons.

330
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:53,533
For the past 18 years,

331
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:59,966
this thought presses upon my heart every single moment.

332
00:24:02,839 --> 00:24:04,206
Apart from this obsession,

333
00:24:04,759 --> 00:24:08,766
I find no joy in this world,

334
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:10,652
nor any expectations.

335
00:24:13,839 --> 00:24:18,085
I once thought that I would lead a life like this until death.

336
00:24:21,640 --> 00:24:23,085
Until I met her.

337
00:24:25,319 --> 00:24:29,805
Do you know the scene when I first saw her?

338
00:24:31,519 --> 00:24:32,519
That day,

339
00:24:34,880 --> 00:24:36,085
I returned to Chang'an.

340
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:38,645
The way she looked on horseback,

341
00:24:40,200 --> 00:24:42,046
I could never forget about it.

342
00:25:41,160 --> 00:25:44,246
After that, she started pestering me.

343
00:25:46,319 --> 00:25:47,565
When I was alone,

344
00:25:48,720 --> 00:25:49,845
I once thought to myself

345
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:56,085
that it might be fate.

346
00:25:57,799 --> 00:26:01,446
Zhu Yu, all these years, I felt like

347
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:04,046
we weren't truly close even though we looked close.

348
00:26:04,519 --> 00:26:07,085
I feel that you were aloof and indifferent.

349
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:09,200
I...

350
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,246
I never expected you to fret over such an affair.

351
00:26:13,519 --> 00:26:16,365
How dare I speak of being aloof when I haven't experienced the world yet?

352
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,286
With her existence,

353
00:26:20,599 --> 00:26:23,966
it made me think that the worldly realm wasn't as bad as I thought.

354
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,085
Besides reminiscing about the past,

355
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:31,805
I finally longed for the future.

356
00:26:32,920 --> 00:26:34,046
I started to have desires.

357
00:26:35,319 --> 00:26:38,165
Therefore, I think she's worth all of my sacrifices.

358
00:26:40,160 --> 00:26:41,885
I can't allow my beloved

359
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,206
to stay in Chang'an as it's dangerous.

360
00:26:46,039 --> 00:26:47,286
I have to head back and protect her.

361
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,766
I mustn't let what happened 18 years ago repeat itself.

362
00:28:03,319 --> 00:28:04,486
According to the sect rules,

363
00:28:05,119 --> 00:28:09,246
if one wishes to leave the sect, one has to enter the White Night Array

364
00:28:09,519 --> 00:28:11,286
and be punished by the White Night Birds.

365
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:13,686
After that, they may leave.

366
00:28:19,359 --> 00:28:21,773
Zhu Yu, no weapons are allowed

367
00:28:22,559 --> 00:28:24,085
in the White Night Array.

368
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,726
What the heck is this array?

369
00:29:07,359 --> 00:29:10,766
Zhu Yu, are you sure you can withstand this?

370
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:13,246
Physical pain

371
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,286
means nothing to me.

372
00:29:30,119 --> 00:29:32,325
Brother Ming, there are too many birds.

373
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:35,766
All these birds will pierce through his body? How can he endure that?

374
00:29:36,047 --> 00:29:37,600
The White Night Array has been activated.

375
00:29:38,215 --> 00:29:39,560
No one can stop it.

376
00:30:28,039 --> 00:30:29,039
Zhu Yu!

377
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:05,246
It's finally over.

378
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:40,039
Zhu Yu!

379
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,559
Zhu Yu!

380
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,680
Zhu Yu!

381
00:31:48,075 --> 00:31:49,119
What's going on?

382
00:31:49,241 --> 00:31:52,040
I've never seen a second punishment before? Did something go wrong?

383
00:31:52,120 --> 00:31:54,120
Mind your words. It's an array filled with divine birds.

384
00:31:54,200 --> 00:31:55,605
They do not commit mistakes.

385
00:31:57,876 --> 00:32:01,202
This is strange. I suppose it's the wrath of Heaven.

386
00:32:01,755 --> 00:32:03,316
Zhu Yu has fainted!

387
00:32:03,440 --> 00:32:06,006
Zhu Yu, wake up!

388
00:32:09,680 --> 00:32:11,165
They can't punish him for the third time.

389
00:32:11,319 --> 00:32:12,526
Zhu Yu will die from this!

390
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:14,719
Yeah. Twice is already harsh enough.

391
00:32:14,799 --> 00:32:16,085
How could they punish him again?

392
00:32:43,599 --> 00:32:44,726
You have ten days.

393
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:47,885
(With a righteous heart and pure intent, all obstacles can be overcome!)

394
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,533
Is that the Changxi Truncheon?

395
00:33:24,046 --> 00:33:27,332
Boss, why are you doing the rounds together with me today?

396
00:33:27,640 --> 00:33:30,766
Shu has taken leave. Now, you have to manage the Ruyi Pavilion

397
00:33:31,096 --> 00:33:32,662
and his bookstore as well.

398
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:33,966
It's tough on you.

399
00:33:34,279 --> 00:33:36,405
As your boss, I feel sorry for you.

400
00:33:41,188 --> 00:33:43,268
My home is too chaotic. I don't want to stay home.

401
00:33:43,982 --> 00:33:46,629
Is the duke still worried about Mr. Mei's promise of return?

402
00:33:47,239 --> 00:33:49,246
Say, why hasn't he returned yet?

403
00:33:50,168 --> 00:33:51,613
Could he be in trouble?

404
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:55,766
With his capabilities, I don't think he'll be in trouble.

405
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,679
But what if he doesn't want to return of his own accord?

406
00:33:59,759 --> 00:34:02,246
Boss, are you sure you can remain composed?

407
00:34:03,377 --> 00:34:05,143
What else do you think I should do?

408
00:34:05,271 --> 00:34:06,438
Cause a ruckus?

409
00:34:07,381 --> 00:34:11,228
It seems Cat Lord has truly fallen for him.

410
00:34:12,928 --> 00:34:14,808
Come and place your bets.

411
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:16,685
Place your bets!

412
00:34:20,102 --> 00:34:21,183
It's been so many days.

413
00:34:21,264 --> 00:34:23,184
Commissioner Mei hasn't returned yet.

414
00:34:23,313 --> 00:34:26,118
In my opinion, it's obvious enough.

415
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,806
I'm sure he ran away from the marriage.

416
00:34:29,528 --> 00:34:31,169
We're veterans, you know?

417
00:34:31,280 --> 00:34:33,280
We know that the best.

418
00:34:33,360 --> 00:34:35,046
- Indeed.   - Don't you agree?

419
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:36,599
My bet is that he ran away from marriage.

420
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:37,679
I'll bet on this.

421
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,565
That gambling house has started a new round of betting.

422
00:34:40,840 --> 00:34:42,886
They're betting on whether Mr. Mei will return for the marriage or not.

423
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:44,366
Let's go and place our bets too.

424
00:34:45,280 --> 00:34:47,165
If he doesn't return, at least we'll make a fortune.

425
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:48,605
We won't incur any losses.

426
00:34:50,239 --> 00:34:51,239
Boss?

427
00:34:57,543 --> 00:34:58,560
He has definitely run away from marriage.

428
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:00,734
Here comes a young lady. Come.

429
00:35:02,394 --> 00:35:03,654
(Run Away From Marriage)

430
00:35:04,271 --> 00:35:05,337
(Will Return)

431
00:35:05,591 --> 00:35:07,477
Lady, don't hesitate.

432
00:35:07,679 --> 00:35:09,755
It's been over ten days since Mr. Mei's departure.

433
00:35:09,836 --> 00:35:11,315
I'm sure he doesn't want to marry her.

434
00:35:11,519 --> 00:35:13,846
Of course that's the case.

435
00:35:15,199 --> 00:35:16,526
Bet on this.

436
00:35:17,993 --> 00:35:19,847
Bet on this. You'll surely win.

437
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:24,320
What's wrong?

438
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:27,125
Lady, do you think Mr. Mei will return?

439
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:29,006
I just hope that he'll return as soon as possible.

440
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:31,373
I want him to return early.

441
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,765
He won't.

442
00:35:33,000 --> 00:35:34,726
She'll definitely lose.

443
00:35:34,799 --> 00:35:35,886
She'll lose all of her money.

444
00:35:35,960 --> 00:35:37,159
Come.

445
00:35:37,239 --> 00:35:38,239
This is my bet!

446
00:35:38,347 --> 00:35:40,066
Zhu Yu!

447
00:35:40,239 --> 00:35:41,239
Zhu Yu!

448
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,526
Zhu Yu, wake up.

449
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:50,006
This is...

450
00:35:50,239 --> 00:35:51,599
It's harrowing indeed.

451
00:35:51,679 --> 00:35:54,806
I've only heard of them before. Today's my first time seeing these birds.

452
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,075
Zhu Yu.

453
00:35:58,159 --> 00:35:59,326
Be gentle.

454
00:36:00,800 --> 00:36:02,006
He's still alive?

455
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:04,085
How is that possible?

456
00:36:21,974 --> 00:36:26,301
From now on, you're no longer a member of Changxi Palace.

457
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:33,205
Seniors, thank you for taking care of me all these years.

458
00:36:34,440 --> 00:36:37,326
May all of you be safe and joyful.

459
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,165
May you all lead a life with no worries.

460
00:36:43,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Zhu Yu.

461
00:36:45,289 --> 00:36:46,442
It's a harsh punishment.

462
00:36:46,522 --> 00:36:48,735
Why don't you rest here for a few days before leaving?

463
00:36:49,473 --> 00:36:50,501
That won't do.

464
00:36:50,599 --> 00:36:53,806
Since he's no longer a member, he cannot rest and recuperate here.

465
00:36:56,760 --> 00:36:57,760
No need for that.

466
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:00,645
I made a promise with someone from Chang'an.

467
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:01,933
I'm in a hurry to head back.

468
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:03,926
I won't rest and recuperate here.

469
00:37:07,199 --> 00:37:08,199
Fine.

470
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:10,846
But before you leave,

471
00:37:12,320 --> 00:37:13,685
there's one last thing you must do.

472
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,406
You have to leave the Changxi Truncheon behind.

473
00:37:22,920 --> 00:37:25,765
Indeed. Master has left that behind for you.

474
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,685
But he left it behind

475
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:30,725
for his disciple at Changxi Palace.

476
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:33,184
It's not for someone who has abandoned his sect

477
00:37:33,264 --> 00:37:35,229
because of a woman, Mei Zhu Yu.

478
00:37:37,039 --> 00:37:40,085
Indeed. Changxi Truncheon belongs to Changxi Palace.

479
00:37:40,320 --> 00:37:41,406
You have to leave it behind.

480
00:37:44,719 --> 00:37:46,565
Is the chicken ready?

481
00:37:46,840 --> 00:37:50,205
Master, I haven't finished my homework yet.

482
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:52,846
Do you think I'm asking you to do it for free?

483
00:37:53,148 --> 00:37:54,794
Of course there's something in it for you.

484
00:37:55,039 --> 00:37:56,039
Roast the chicken.

485
00:37:56,679 --> 00:37:57,679
What's in it for me?

486
00:37:58,199 --> 00:38:00,765
I'll trade my artifact for a roasted chicken.

487
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:06,061
Master, this truncheon belongs to you.

488
00:38:06,256 --> 00:38:08,262
You should take it. How could you give it to me?

489
00:38:08,679 --> 00:38:11,605
I'm old now. I have to make arrangements for the future.

490
00:38:12,599 --> 00:38:13,599
But Master...

491
00:38:15,400 --> 00:38:16,413
It's just a joke.

492
00:38:17,480 --> 00:38:19,406
My internal injury hasn't fully recovered

493
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:21,806
ever since my battle with that demon three months ago.

494
00:38:22,159 --> 00:38:23,806
I assume it's because of my age.

495
00:38:23,920 --> 00:38:27,285
I'm giving the Changxi Truncheon to you as a form of entrustment.

496
00:38:28,280 --> 00:38:30,846
From now on, I'll entrust the demon-slaying duties to you.

497
00:38:31,144 --> 00:38:33,713
Master, even if you wish to entrust this artifact to someone,

498
00:38:33,887 --> 00:38:35,212
it shouldn't be me.

499
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:37,366
Brother Ming is the official successor.

500
00:38:38,199 --> 00:38:40,406
That has nothing to do with the Changxi Truncheon.

501
00:38:40,800 --> 00:38:42,526
It's just an artifact.

502
00:38:42,865 --> 00:38:44,351
We merely use them to slay demons.

503
00:38:44,519 --> 00:38:48,159
Moreover, your senior is diligent and upright.

504
00:38:48,239 --> 00:38:49,446
He won't mind it.

505
00:38:49,913 --> 00:38:53,439
The duties of a Celestial Master should never be dictated by a truncheon.

506
00:38:53,679 --> 00:38:56,599
I hope even more that you take it to explore the world

507
00:38:56,679 --> 00:39:00,565
and experience the bonds and affairs of the Mortal Realm.

508
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,406
Here, take it.

509
00:39:06,559 --> 00:39:07,559
Give it a try.

510
00:39:19,880 --> 00:39:21,446
It hasn't acknowledged you as its new owner yet.

511
00:39:21,880 --> 00:39:25,085
You must communicate with it wholeheartedly.

512
00:39:47,880 --> 00:39:48,880
Not bad.

513
00:39:58,400 --> 00:39:59,400
Not bad at all.

514
00:40:00,599 --> 00:40:02,685
Now, it's truly yours.

515
00:40:11,239 --> 00:40:12,239
I know.

516
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,120
Changxi Truncheon is a keepsake of Master's.

517
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,453
You can't bear to part with it.

518
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,926
But it belongs to Changxi Palace after all.

519
00:40:20,928 --> 00:40:22,880
You have to look at the bigger picture.
