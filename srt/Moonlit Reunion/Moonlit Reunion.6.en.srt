00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:30,917
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,021 --> 00:01:33,880
(Episode 6)

3
00:01:45,638 --> 00:01:46,824
Anyone here?

4
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:52,320
The meeting place is so dirty.

5
00:01:52,477 --> 00:01:54,550
There's no one cleaning. Where's everyone?

6
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,312
Are you sure the Rat Demon escaped from this place?

7
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,644
I'm sure.

8
00:02:36,520 --> 00:02:39,513
The entrance of this barrier was created by the first Demon City lord.

9
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:41,073
It is very mysterious.

10
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,592
The walls of the barrier have the ability to verify demons.

11
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,197
Those who are allowed by the Demon Lord can enter and leave freely.

12
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,472
Otherwise, demons outside the barrier cannot enter

13
00:02:48,759 --> 00:02:50,752
and the demons inside the barrier cannot escape.

14
00:02:51,759 --> 00:02:54,432
This entrance has been working as intended for centuries.

15
00:02:55,217 --> 00:02:57,935
Elder Gray does not have permission to allow a demon to enter or leave.

16
00:02:58,000 --> 00:02:59,752
He will never release the Rat Demon.

17
00:03:00,639 --> 00:03:01,793
I'm sure you made a mistake.

18
00:03:03,479 --> 00:03:06,833
Is that so? Did he not release the Rat Demon?

19
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,472
What spell did he cast on the forehead?

20
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:13,872
A spell on the forehead?

21
00:03:14,417 --> 00:03:15,511
Rat Demon.

22
00:03:16,866 --> 00:03:17,924
Don't tell me

23
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:21,113
- it's the Astral Wandering spell?   - Astral...

24
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,472
Isn't that a forbidden spell?

25
00:03:24,199 --> 00:03:26,592
No wonder the old man was rushing me to find the Rat Demon.

26
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:29,273
He was trying to distract me and hurt Yu Zhen.

27
00:03:30,252 --> 00:03:31,395
Cat Lord is in danger.

28
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:57,632
The Cat Lord has entered the mountains

29
00:03:57,863 --> 00:03:59,674
and will soon obtain the Lightning Wood.

30
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,592
Have you prepared everything?

31
00:04:02,240 --> 00:04:03,516
Nothing must go wrong.

32
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:05,152
We mustn't let her get what she wants.

33
00:04:05,240 --> 00:04:06,912
Don't worry, Elder Gray.

34
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,673
I've set up a demonic array around the Lightning Wood.

35
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:14,152
The Cat Lord has the form of a human during the day.

36
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:17,233
She will surely die when she touches it.

37
00:04:18,502 --> 00:04:19,615
However,

38
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:22,233
why is there a mortal by her side?

39
00:04:23,839 --> 00:04:25,080
Who is that?

40
00:04:25,522 --> 00:04:26,654
I heard

41
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:30,632
he's an official from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

42
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:32,033
His name is Mei...

43
00:04:33,623 --> 00:04:34,655
Mei...

44
00:04:36,879 --> 00:04:38,072
Whatever.

45
00:04:38,319 --> 00:04:40,872
A mortal or two is nothing to worry about.

46
00:04:43,519 --> 00:04:46,593
However, you must not go back on your words,

47
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,512
Elder Gray.

48
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:49,963
Naturally.

49
00:04:50,079 --> 00:04:51,113
Once it is done,

50
00:04:51,439 --> 00:04:53,993
I will take over the Cat Lord's authority.

51
00:04:54,079 --> 00:04:56,272
I can protect you from harm

52
00:04:56,519 --> 00:04:59,153
even if you have fun and create chaos in Chang'an,

53
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,971
let alone charming others in the Western outskirts.

54
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,832
That's good to hear.

55
00:05:22,447 --> 00:05:23,532
I'm hungry.

56
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,432
I'll go and find some food.

57
00:05:49,889 --> 00:05:51,000
Lady Wu Zhen.

58
00:06:01,240 --> 00:06:02,632
Mr. Mei, you're amazing.

59
00:06:02,839 --> 00:06:04,632
You found food so quickly.

60
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:06,700
That's too much praise.

61
00:06:12,480 --> 00:06:13,913
Are you telling me

62
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,752
that we'll be having rabbit later?

63
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,153
What else?

64
00:06:26,040 --> 00:06:27,632
Is there something wrong with you?

65
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,913
You don't like cats and you want to eat rabbits.

66
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,850
Do you have a grudge against mammals?

67
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,072
They are so cute.

68
00:06:34,920 --> 00:06:36,593
Why don't you touch it?

69
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:40,312
You can only feel this in mammals.

70
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:44,993
It escaped.

71
00:06:45,854 --> 00:06:47,005
Lady Wu Zhen,

72
00:06:48,134 --> 00:06:49,768
you released our lunch.

73
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,632
I'll have to trouble you to find us more food then.

74
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:55,072
Don't find something too cute.

75
00:06:55,160 --> 00:06:56,192
I can't bear to eat them.

76
00:06:58,460 --> 00:06:59,586
Don't run around.

77
00:07:29,480 --> 00:07:31,632
I, Wu Zi Shu, have been in Chang'an for many years

78
00:07:32,203 --> 00:07:34,432
yet I don't know there are still demons in the Western Outskirts.

79
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:36,993
How disrespectful of me.

80
00:07:37,560 --> 00:07:40,113
I, the Mountain Specter, have been in the Western Outskirts for many years

81
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:42,952
yet I don't know there's such a handsome demon

82
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:45,512
in Chang'an.

83
00:07:52,959 --> 00:07:53,993
Where's the old rat?

84
00:07:56,959 --> 00:07:58,113
Am I

85
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:01,113
not as attractive as him?

86
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:03,392
In that case,

87
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:05,752
he is indeed here.

88
00:08:08,439 --> 00:08:09,793
Be patient.

89
00:08:11,519 --> 00:08:13,033
It makes me sad

90
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:15,793
to see you treat me so coldly.

91
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:23,872
Do you have someone you like?

92
00:08:24,519 --> 00:08:27,993
That has nothing to do with you.

93
00:08:31,079 --> 00:08:34,912
It seems like there's indeed someone in your heart.

94
00:08:35,480 --> 00:08:39,392
Let me take a guess. Is she far away

95
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,193
or is she beside you?

96
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,366
Shu!

97
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:58,392
I see.

98
00:09:00,960 --> 00:09:04,196
That's the person you are thinking of?

99
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,593
Nonsense.

100
00:09:10,605 --> 00:09:11,606
Shu!

101
00:09:15,848 --> 00:09:16,883
Shu!

102
00:09:18,308 --> 00:09:19,362
Shu!

103
00:09:20,978 --> 00:09:22,157
Shu!

104
00:09:25,065 --> 00:09:26,123
Shu!

105
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:27,454
Shu!

106
00:09:28,159 --> 00:09:29,519
- Shu!   - Shu!

107
00:12:37,559 --> 00:12:40,032
I was careless.

108
00:12:40,519 --> 00:12:43,713
The mortal man seemed weak

109
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:45,473
but he could actually fight.

110
00:12:46,080 --> 00:12:47,433
If we keep dragging on,

111
00:12:47,679 --> 00:12:49,993
Wu Zi Shu might escape as well.

112
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,904
That probably won't happen.

113
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:54,233
Rest assured, Elder Gray.

114
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,110
Wu Zi Shu has been trapped by this illusion.

115
00:13:01,003 --> 00:13:02,017
Zhen.

116
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,436
Wu Zi Shu is busy with his work all day

117
00:13:04,519 --> 00:13:06,113
and likes to run his mouth.

118
00:13:06,194 --> 00:13:07,198
Zhen.

119
00:13:07,759 --> 00:13:08,833
I didn't expect him

120
00:13:09,639 --> 00:13:11,672
to be a lovesick soul.

121
00:13:13,080 --> 00:13:15,436
The person beside her

122
00:13:15,519 --> 00:13:16,993
is also a nuisance.

123
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,552
Don't let her get away this time.

124
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:24,912
Don't worry, Elder Gray.

125
00:13:48,879 --> 00:13:51,313
What happened at the cave just now?

126
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,313
I went inside unintentionally.

127
00:13:53,759 --> 00:13:56,313
I didn't expect to see a mad tree inside.

128
00:13:57,759 --> 00:13:59,233
I heard there were spirits and demons

129
00:13:59,399 --> 00:14:00,752
in the forests.

130
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,593
When I couldn't find you previously, I was worried about your safety.

131
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:06,833
Thankfully, you were calm, Lady Wu Zhen.

132
00:14:07,159 --> 00:14:08,193
I wasn't calm.

133
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:10,833
I thought I would die in...

134
00:14:15,840 --> 00:14:17,233
The arms of a handsome man.

135
00:14:24,080 --> 00:14:26,433
Since you can make jokes, that means you're fine.

136
00:14:28,618 --> 00:14:31,121
You've never told me that you knew martial arts though.

137
00:14:32,559 --> 00:14:34,233
Lady Wu Zhen, you've never asked.

138
00:14:36,480 --> 00:14:38,392
You didn't deny it

139
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,872
when I said you were weak.

140
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:45,111
Here.

141
00:14:46,385 --> 00:14:47,471
It's done.

142
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:51,353
Wild chicken. It's poultry.

143
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:00,912
Where did you learn martial arts from?

144
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:05,792
When I was young, I learned some basics from my seniors.

145
00:15:08,535 --> 00:15:09,720
I see.

146
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:17,993
Lady Wu Zhen, let me get you some water.

147
00:15:18,200 --> 00:15:20,872
Don't move around this time.

148
00:15:43,720 --> 00:15:46,433
The Mountain Specter is very annoying.

149
00:15:46,960 --> 00:15:48,912
I'm the Cat Lord so I can hold my breath.

150
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,552
I won't fall for her tricks.

151
00:15:52,200 --> 00:15:54,073
Why must she do something so useless?

152
00:15:57,440 --> 00:16:00,113
Oh no, it's probably effective against Mr. Mei.

153
00:16:29,320 --> 00:16:30,872
There are so many rotten things.

154
00:16:31,879 --> 00:16:33,752
No wonder there's a thick miasma here

155
00:16:34,080 --> 00:16:35,512
creating the Mountain Specter.

156
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:52,037
Mei Zhu Yu!

157
00:16:55,177 --> 00:16:56,272
Mei Zhu Yu!

158
00:16:58,462 --> 00:16:59,552
Mei Zhu Yu!

159
00:17:03,370 --> 00:17:04,600
Where is he?

160
00:17:08,237 --> 00:17:09,360
Mr. Mei.

161
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:21,312
Lady Wu Zhen? Why are you here?

162
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:25,233
It is too foggy in the mountains.

163
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:27,071
I was afraid that you might get lost

164
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:29,993
so I came to take a look.

165
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,312
Just now, I saw a beautiful flower

166
00:17:41,079 --> 00:17:42,752
on the cliff.

167
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:44,673
Unfortunately, I can't get up there.

168
00:17:45,399 --> 00:17:46,478
Mr. Mei,

169
00:17:47,759 --> 00:17:49,352
can you help me pluck it?

170
00:17:59,122 --> 00:18:00,200
For you.

171
00:18:12,720 --> 00:18:14,112
It's so pretty.

172
00:18:18,279 --> 00:18:20,393
Can you put it on for me?

173
00:19:25,707 --> 00:19:26,802
Demon.

174
00:19:31,519 --> 00:19:32,913
Mei Zhu Yu!

175
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:36,663
Mei Zhu Yu!

176
00:19:44,319 --> 00:19:45,873
Mei Zhu Yu!

177
00:20:02,839 --> 00:20:04,112
Mei Zhu Yu!

178
00:20:06,079 --> 00:20:07,352
Where is he?

179
00:20:19,079 --> 00:20:20,193
Where is he?

180
00:20:22,839 --> 00:20:24,112
Mei Zhu Yu!

181
00:20:32,712 --> 00:20:33,713
Mei Zhu Yu?

182
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,552
Mr. Mei?

183
00:20:44,920 --> 00:20:46,473
You are here.

184
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:48,752
I've finally found you.

185
00:20:58,960 --> 00:20:59,993
What's wrong?

186
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:02,233
Why does she look identical to me?

187
00:21:02,820 --> 00:21:04,065
There's something wrong with her.

188
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:07,512
Demon, how dare you accuse me instead?

189
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:17,112
Look. She's a demon.

190
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,233
- I'm not.   - Mr. Mei, kill her.

191
00:21:23,575 --> 00:21:24,642
Come with me.

192
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:27,233
Mr. Mei, kill her. I'm the real one.

193
00:21:35,375 --> 00:21:36,416
Kill her.

194
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:39,200
Mr. Mei. Hurry.

195
00:21:45,848 --> 00:21:46,930
Why...

196
00:21:52,359 --> 00:21:53,592
Why?

197
00:21:53,920 --> 00:21:55,312
Because you are the demon.

198
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:02,233
How dare you ruin my cultivation?

199
00:22:05,599 --> 00:22:08,393
Have a taste of this poison miasma.

200
00:22:19,640 --> 00:22:21,473
Mei Zhu Yu!

201
00:22:22,050 --> 00:22:23,238
Mei Zhu Yu!

202
00:22:30,200 --> 00:22:31,272
You failed.

203
00:22:31,759 --> 00:22:34,673
I'm afraid the agreement between us is void.

204
00:22:34,758 --> 00:22:35,758
Elder Gray.

205
00:22:36,315 --> 00:22:38,629
It's not right for you to betray me.

206
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:41,953
I'm in trouble myself. How can I protect you?

207
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:44,837
I'm warning you now. You've attracted a lot of heat recently.

208
00:22:44,920 --> 00:22:47,112
You should be captured according to the rules of Demon City.

209
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:50,552
Now that you've offended Cat Lord and her helper,

210
00:22:50,759 --> 00:22:52,117
you should leave immediately

211
00:22:52,200 --> 00:22:53,592
if you still value your life.

212
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,832
- Where are you going?   - Back to Demon City of course.

213
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:59,792
What a coincidence, Elder Gray.

214
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:05,592
Why are you acting like a stranger, Elder Gray?

215
00:23:05,839 --> 00:23:08,233
You're just going to leave without even greeting me?

216
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:10,685
What?

217
00:23:10,920 --> 00:23:12,993
Do you think I can't find evidence

218
00:23:13,079 --> 00:23:14,592
of you using a forbidden spell

219
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:18,193
to escape Demon City because you don't do anything, Elder Gray?

220
00:23:21,279 --> 00:23:22,637
You're not showing me respect

221
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:24,112
and that's humiliating for me.

222
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:28,312
Whatever. I don't have to be lenient

223
00:23:28,920 --> 00:23:30,993
since this is just an ordinary rat.

224
00:23:40,839 --> 00:23:42,792
She's good at escaping.

225
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:44,550
How dare he

226
00:23:46,119 --> 00:23:47,592
hurt my conscience

227
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:51,153
and ruin my hundred-year cultivation?

228
00:23:56,921 --> 00:23:58,133
Mei Zhu Yu.

229
00:23:59,551 --> 00:24:00,663
Mei Zhu Yu.

230
00:24:02,943 --> 00:24:04,078
Mei Zhu Yu.

231
00:24:44,608 --> 00:24:45,652
Mei Zhu Yu.

232
00:24:47,000 --> 00:24:50,072
He has inhaled too much miasma as a mortal.

233
00:24:51,079 --> 00:24:52,312
It seems like I can only...

234
00:26:17,000 --> 00:26:18,592
You are quite intelligent

235
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:21,633
for a mortal man.

236
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:47,953
I don't believe it.

237
00:26:48,319 --> 00:26:49,436
I must go inside tonight

238
00:26:49,519 --> 00:26:50,832
and see what's going on.

239
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:56,913
- If I knew, I would've eaten less.   - Fourth Master Mei.

240
00:26:58,400 --> 00:26:59,535
Lady Liu... I...

241
00:26:59,616 --> 00:27:01,170
I told you

242
00:27:01,360 --> 00:27:02,833
that everything was fine.

243
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,823
Why must you still spread rumors

244
00:27:06,044 --> 00:27:07,601
and say that there are demons in Liu Residence?

245
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:09,320
That is not a rumor.

246
00:27:09,599 --> 00:27:11,112
I saw it with my own eyes.

247
00:27:11,240 --> 00:27:13,913
There was a white snake slithering around the Liu Residence that day.

248
00:27:15,480 --> 00:27:16,713
It was slithering...

249
00:27:17,359 --> 00:27:18,837
It was this tall

250
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:20,032
that was rare.

251
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:22,873
I'm sure it has turned into a spiritual being of some sort.

252
00:27:26,319 --> 00:27:27,552
I actually entered successfully.

253
00:27:27,640 --> 00:27:32,832
So? Does a spiritual being deserve to be chased away and killed?

254
00:27:35,880 --> 00:27:37,673
I don't mean that.

255
00:27:40,867 --> 00:27:41,920
Whatever.

256
00:27:42,599 --> 00:27:44,673
Since you are trying to help me,

257
00:27:44,920 --> 00:27:48,352
I might have a task for you.

258
00:27:49,839 --> 00:27:50,953
Lady Liu, please tell me.

259
00:27:51,240 --> 00:27:52,473
I won't let you down.

260
00:27:53,359 --> 00:27:54,913
Fourth Master Mei,

261
00:27:55,319 --> 00:27:57,112
please help me get an item.

262
00:27:57,193 --> 00:27:58,246
No problem.

263
00:28:00,050 --> 00:28:01,240
Where should I go?

264
00:28:37,007 --> 00:28:38,093
You're awake.

265
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:43,352
What happened to me?

266
00:28:45,599 --> 00:28:46,633
You passed out.

267
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:56,433
I remember there were two of you.

268
00:28:58,655 --> 00:29:00,408
There are demons in this mountain.

269
00:29:01,319 --> 00:29:02,476
The miasma turned into someone

270
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:04,112
who looked exactly like me.

271
00:29:04,640 --> 00:29:05,993
Thankfully, you were amazing

272
00:29:06,079 --> 00:29:08,233
and found out who the real one is and dispersed the miasma.

273
00:29:09,079 --> 00:29:10,433
What happened

274
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:12,433
after I dispersed the miasma?

275
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,072
After that, you passed out.

276
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:16,956
I protected you

277
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:18,112
until you woke up.

278
00:29:19,132 --> 00:29:20,177
That's all?

279
00:29:24,839 --> 00:29:26,592
Why are you acting so strangely?

280
00:29:27,480 --> 00:29:28,953
It's nothing.

281
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,032
Mr. Mei, the sun has come up.

282
00:30:24,279 --> 00:30:25,920
- Your Highness.   - Your Highness.

283
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,312
You have finally returned.

284
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:30,953
I've prepared a comfortable carriage and servants.

285
00:30:31,119 --> 00:30:32,953
Please return to the city immediately, Your Highness.

286
00:31:12,599 --> 00:31:14,953
Your Highness, the person in front is...

287
00:31:17,839 --> 00:31:19,473
It's me, Fourth Master Mei.

288
00:31:20,319 --> 00:31:21,592
Si?

289
00:31:25,559 --> 00:31:26,792
Why are you here?

290
00:31:26,880 --> 00:31:28,072
What a coincidence, Miss Zhen.

291
00:31:28,470 --> 00:31:29,515
I'm so tired.

292
00:31:31,599 --> 00:31:33,993
Little Fish? Why are you here too?

293
00:31:38,319 --> 00:31:41,393
Miss Zhen, can you give me a sip of water?

294
00:31:49,839 --> 00:31:50,960
Slow down.

295
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,953
You seem like you're going to a faraway place.

296
00:31:58,034 --> 00:31:59,360
Where are you going?

297
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:01,557
Miss Zhen, I was requested by Lady Liu

298
00:32:01,640 --> 00:32:02,792
to do an important task.

299
00:32:03,032 --> 00:32:04,126
Liu Tai Zhen?

300
00:32:04,923 --> 00:32:06,009
What is it?

301
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:08,516
Lady Liu told me

302
00:32:08,599 --> 00:32:11,953
there were demons in her residence.

303
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:16,272
The master said

304
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:17,913
I need to keep going west

305
00:32:18,079 --> 00:32:19,433
and find a blade of divine grass

306
00:32:19,599 --> 00:32:21,153
to resolve the Liu Residence's trouble.

307
00:32:21,432 --> 00:32:22,436
West?

308
00:32:22,818 --> 00:32:23,872
What is it?

309
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:25,953
The master said

310
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:28,592
it's a secret.

311
00:32:30,799 --> 00:32:32,792
I just need to keep going west

312
00:32:33,079 --> 00:32:34,473
and not turn back

313
00:32:34,663 --> 00:32:36,719
until I find a divine grass with green flowers and red leaves

314
00:32:36,957 --> 00:32:38,633
that is as tall as two people.

315
00:32:38,832 --> 00:32:41,003
Si, should I help you?

316
00:32:41,279 --> 00:32:42,512
Sure, Miss Zhen.

317
00:32:44,078 --> 00:32:45,248
Lin Yuan! Huai An!

318
00:32:49,119 --> 00:32:50,233
Miss Zhen, you are so nice.

319
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,599
- Take him back.   - Yes.

320
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:56,000
- No.   - Move.

321
00:32:56,400 --> 00:32:57,597
I'm heading west!

322
00:32:57,680 --> 00:32:59,637
This is the wrong direction!

323
00:32:59,720 --> 00:33:01,953
I think Liu Tai Zhen chased him out.

324
00:33:02,941 --> 00:33:04,043
Let's go!

325
00:33:09,764 --> 00:33:15,605
(Chang'an)

326
00:33:41,603 --> 00:33:43,148
Lady Wu Zhen, thank you for sending me back.

327
00:33:43,524 --> 00:33:45,158
Are you sure you don't want me to send you home?

328
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:46,312
No need.

329
00:33:46,610 --> 00:33:48,803
My residence is in the opposite direction.

330
00:33:48,902 --> 00:33:50,072
All of you should go back earlier.

331
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,032
Little Fish, help me out.

332
00:33:57,556 --> 00:33:58,633
Mr. Mei.

333
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:04,312
What is it, Lady Wu Zhen?

334
00:34:05,000 --> 00:34:07,832
Thank you for helping me yesterday in the mountains.

335
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,178
Little Fish.

336
00:34:15,331 --> 00:34:16,393
See you again.

337
00:34:17,317 --> 00:34:18,360
See you again.

338
00:34:29,199 --> 00:34:32,039
- Your Highness, should we enter the palace directly?   - No.

339
00:34:33,679 --> 00:34:34,953
I still have things to do.

340
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,672
Send me to Ruyi Pavilion.

341
00:34:36,741 --> 00:34:38,599
You just need to return to the palace and inform them.

342
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,672
Tell His Majesty and Her Majesty

343
00:34:42,119 --> 00:34:43,552
that Mr. Mei is with me

344
00:34:43,639 --> 00:34:44,677
and I'm fine.

345
00:34:44,760 --> 00:34:45,873
Tell them not to worry.

346
00:34:46,795 --> 00:34:47,929
Also,

347
00:34:48,599 --> 00:34:52,353
the Arcane Appraisal Bureau only sent one person to investigate the case.

348
00:34:53,400 --> 00:34:54,873
He didn't return for the whole day

349
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:56,873
but no one was worried about him.

350
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,357
Ask His Majesty and Her Majesty

351
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:01,313
to learn from the Arcane Appraisal Bureau.

352
00:35:01,810 --> 00:35:02,997
Seriously.

353
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,833
So easy-going and carefree.

354
00:35:08,775 --> 00:35:09,840
Yes.

355
00:35:42,600 --> 00:35:46,569
(Chang'an)

356
00:35:57,840 --> 00:35:59,152
Is this the Lightning Wood?

357
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,152
You got it so easily?

358
00:36:02,239 --> 00:36:03,753
Why do you think I'm the boss?

359
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,873
You did get it easily

360
00:36:07,360 --> 00:36:08,672
apart from the fact that you got hurt.

361
00:36:11,559 --> 00:36:13,873
That Hui Men actually attacked using that opportunity.

362
00:36:14,159 --> 00:36:15,953
That old rat really had a death wish.

363
00:36:17,239 --> 00:36:19,512
The old man had been traveling back and forth for too long.

364
00:36:19,719 --> 00:36:21,032
It's time to get rid of him.

365
00:36:22,239 --> 00:36:24,473
Shu, we've obtained the Lightning Wood.

366
00:36:24,920 --> 00:36:26,393
When can we break the Undecaying Bone?

367
00:36:27,559 --> 00:36:29,753
The Lightning Wood might be able to disperse evil

368
00:36:30,239 --> 00:36:32,032
but the Undecaying Bone shouldn't be underestimated.

369
00:36:32,519 --> 00:36:34,313
We need to wait for the lightning

370
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:36,672
to strike the Lightning Wood

371
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:38,793
before crushing the Undecaying Bone completely.

372
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:42,393
However, you are still hurt.

373
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,592
You need to recuperate before the lightning strikes.

374
00:36:47,997 --> 00:36:49,376
I'll concoct some medicine for you.

375
00:36:57,320 --> 00:36:59,512
Boss, where are you going?

376
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:03,156
Last night, I didn't dare leave

377
00:37:03,239 --> 00:37:04,473
because of Mr. Mei's safety.

378
00:37:04,639 --> 00:37:07,552
I'm worried about the Mountain Specter that I failed to get rid of.

379
00:37:08,719 --> 00:37:11,112
Hide this from Shu and don't tell him.

380
00:37:11,519 --> 00:37:12,913
Otherwise, he'll nag me again.

381
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:16,552
Be careful, then.

382
00:37:17,235 --> 00:37:18,363
Don't worry.

383
00:37:25,880 --> 00:37:27,080
Be careful.

384
00:37:59,320 --> 00:38:01,753
Let pure will arise and the astral constellations revolve together.

385
00:38:39,440 --> 00:38:41,473
Mortal,

386
00:38:42,119 --> 00:38:43,953
why have you returned?

387
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:46,512
Do you miss me?

388
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:32,873
Celestial Master?

389
00:39:33,832 --> 00:39:35,120
This is impossible.

390
00:39:37,360 --> 00:39:39,152
I've gained my form for decades

391
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:41,152
and have always succeeded.

392
00:39:41,679 --> 00:39:44,273
How can I be defeated by the likes of you?

393
00:39:44,639 --> 00:39:45,833
You overestimated yourself.

394
00:39:49,199 --> 00:39:51,712
When did you realize that I was a fake?

395
00:39:52,159 --> 00:39:53,913
You might have changed into her appearance

396
00:39:54,920 --> 00:39:56,152
but it was actually very different.

397
00:39:57,800 --> 00:39:59,632
You can change your shape and aura

398
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,032
but you can't imitate one's spirit.

399
00:40:03,159 --> 00:40:04,353
I don't get it.

400
00:40:05,320 --> 00:40:07,592
A demon like you will never understand.

401
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:10,953
Do you know what kind of person she is?

402
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:16,816
She might be someone who likes to fool around

403
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:17,960
and play pranks normally

404
00:40:19,071 --> 00:40:20,560
but if she wants a flower,

405
00:40:21,055 --> 00:40:22,360
she will pluck it herself.

406
00:40:30,400 --> 00:40:31,433
If she's in danger,

407
00:40:32,039 --> 00:40:33,632
she will not rely on others

408
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:35,793
let alone hide behind someone's back.

409
00:40:53,679 --> 00:40:55,632
She is unique.

410
00:40:57,559 --> 00:40:58,753
What you changed into

411
00:40:59,239 --> 00:41:00,592
was just your thought of her

412
00:41:01,519 --> 00:41:02,793
and not the exact person.

413
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:05,793
That is the reason why I've lost.

414
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:11,712
Celestial Master.

415
00:41:12,679 --> 00:41:14,232
If you can spare me,

416
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,192
I will tell you

417
00:41:16,280 --> 00:41:18,032
the secret of the girl who's with you.

418
00:41:27,159 --> 00:41:28,360
If it's a secret,

419
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:30,480
you should keep it to yourself.

420
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:35,152
It'll be sealed together with your life.
