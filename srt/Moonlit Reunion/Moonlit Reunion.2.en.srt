00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,560
Episode 2

2
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,000
Father!

3
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,440
Sister!

4
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:41,520
Where are you?

5
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,760
Little girl.

6
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,440
Who are you?

7
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:28,800
I'm Wu Zhen.

8
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:32,440
What are you doing here?

9
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:37,760
There was a fire on the street.

10
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:41,280
It was burning everywhere.

11
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:44,960
I got lost.

12
00:02:45,800 --> 00:02:47,920
You came here at this time.

13
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:50,520
This might be our fate.

14
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,240
Who are you?

15
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,160
You're going to die soon.

16
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:57,160
And I'm the one who's going
to change your destiny.

17
00:02:57,520 --> 00:02:59,320
It's a shame that changing fate

18
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,560
doesn't come free.

19
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,600
There's a price to pay.

20
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:06,360
What's the price?

21
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,600
The price is…

22
00:03:31,240 --> 00:03:34,480
<i>This young man</i>
<i>is quite considerate.</i>

23
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:03,840
You're here.

24
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:05,240
Did I wake you?

25
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:07,680
No, I happened to be up.

26
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:12,440
Did you find any clues?

27
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:15,560
You fought with the female bat
two days ago.

28
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,840
The girl she possessed was sent
to the Bureau of Mystic Investigations.

29
00:04:19,480 --> 00:04:22,720
Upon investigation, the girl is Bi Tao,

30
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:24,920
a dancer at Xiangsi House.

31
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:26,120
Xiangsi House?

32
00:04:26,680 --> 00:04:28,720
And the good friend she lives with is

33
00:04:29,320 --> 00:04:30,840
a dancer at Xiangsi House, too.

34
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:33,080
She's been dancing at Ruyi House lately.

35
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:34,440
Her name is Zhe Liu.

36
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:45,040
I knew it.

37
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,200
She's here.

38
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,240
We can't let her get away.

39
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,040
Let's go to Xiangsi House.

40
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,800
Xiangsi House?

41
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,160
Who are you talking to?

42
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:06,120
You.

43
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:07,600
Me?

44
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,880
I suddenly recalled

45
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:12,560
that many Xiangsi House dancers
came last night.

46
00:05:12,640 --> 00:05:14,160
Maybe someone saw something.

47
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:16,600
I'm free, so I want to go and ask.

48
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,480
If anyone knows where my stuff is,

49
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,600
I won't bother you.

50
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,480
In that case, I'll go to Xiangsi House.

51
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:34,560
Your Highness is going
to Xiangsi House too?

52
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:36,040
Why don't you bring more people?

53
00:05:36,120 --> 00:05:38,480
There's no need.
Isn't Young Master Mei going?

54
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,120
Investigating is an official duty.

55
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:42,120
It's inconvenient for you to come along.

56
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:44,160
That won't do.

57
00:05:44,480 --> 00:05:46,080
It's a red-light district.

58
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:48,520
What if you use your authority
for private gain?

59
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:50,840
After all, you're the man I chose.

60
00:05:50,920 --> 00:05:52,520
I have to keep an eye on you.

61
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:55,200
Go with Her Highness-- Eh?

62
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:57,280
Where are you going?

63
00:05:57,840 --> 00:05:59,280
To the carriage.

64
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:03,200
The carriage?

65
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:06,280
You call it a carriage?

66
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:10,200
Wenhua, Mei family servant

67
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,880
It looks like my horse carriage's baby.

68
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:19,440
Why don't you ride with me?

69
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,120
There's no need.
My carriage is fine.

70
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:33,960
Slow down, Young Master.

71
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:36,320
Young Master! No, Fugui!

72
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,560
Fugui!

73
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,400
Fugui.

74
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:43,600
Fugui!

75
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:47,920
The carriage is gone.

76
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:51,960
Lady Wu, what you did was inappropriate.

77
00:07:10,920 --> 00:07:14,440
Longing Pavillion

78
00:07:15,240 --> 00:07:18,600
Zhe Liu, Xiangsi House dancer

79
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:34,440
Where exactly did you go?

80
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
Don't leave me.

81
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,280
No.

82
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,640
No.

83
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:24,560
Zhe Liu.

84
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:28,360
Come in.

85
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:35,040
Why didn't you practice dancing today?

86
00:08:35,520 --> 00:08:37,080
We've been looking for you.

87
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:39,200
I'm not feeling well.

88
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,440
Today's guests are waiting.

89
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,200
Come with me.

90
00:08:48,760 --> 00:08:50,480
Come and take a look!

91
00:08:51,960 --> 00:08:54,760
Look, isn't that
County Princess's carriage?

92
00:08:56,840 --> 00:08:59,400
As the saying goes,
throw fruit until the carriage is full,

93
00:08:59,480 --> 00:09:00,680
look until Wei Jie is dead.

94
00:09:00,760 --> 00:09:03,400
You're prominent now.

95
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,640
There's no harm in enjoying that.

96
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:10,280
This carriage is Lady Wu Zhen's.

97
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:11,360
Who is this young man?

98
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
Could he be Lady Wu Zhen's new lover?

99
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:14,520
New lover?

100
00:09:14,840 --> 00:09:16,400
Let me see what he looks like.

101
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,640
His appearance is really…

102
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,280
Look at his head shape.

103
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,920
He's so handsome!

104
00:09:23,280 --> 00:09:25,160
Not as handsome as you.

105
00:09:26,040 --> 00:09:27,200
Bai Xuanchen…

106
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:33,040
<i>Free-Spirited Princess</i>
<i>and Handsome Scholar.</i>

107
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:36,320
Do you like this?

108
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,160
There's also <i>Female General</i>
<i>and Little Guard</i>,

109
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,440
<i>Female Official and Young Master</i>,

110
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:44,960
<i>Lady Boss and Waiter</i>.

111
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,560
I know. Don't be anxious.

112
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:13,880
What's the matter?

113
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,240
Nothing.

114
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,120
Sir, are you here for fun?

115
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:23,200
Longing Pavillion

116
00:10:23,280 --> 00:10:25,160
Lady Wu Zhen.

117
00:10:25,240 --> 00:10:26,560
You haven't been here for a while.

118
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:27,640
Yes.

119
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:30,280
This is Mr. Mei
from the Bureau of Mystic Investigations.

120
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,560
He's here today to ask you something.

121
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,320
Young Master.

122
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,360
What a handsome young man.

123
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,520
What do you want to ask?

124
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:41,040
Yes.

125
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,440
Do you want to ask me or her?

126
00:10:43,520 --> 00:10:44,520
Longing Pavillion

127
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:51,280
Sleeves Dancing in the Wind

128
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,280
- My lord.
- Wait.

129
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:08,680
What are you doing?

130
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:10,320
How dare you!

131
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,440
Get out of the way.

132
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:16,120
My lord?

133
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:18,400
Lady Wu.

134
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:20,480
What are you doing here?

135
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:24,080
I'm here to…

136
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,440
Pick a fight?

137
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,960
Are you looking for trouble?

138
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,840
I'm telling you, don't come near me.

139
00:11:33,520 --> 00:11:34,760
Let me tell you.

140
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:37,040
I'm not interested in you at all now.

141
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,400
We don't mind each other's business.

142
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,640
Well… Look.

143
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:45,160
I have someone new now.

144
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:46,440
It's too late to regret it.

145
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:47,840
I might not agree to it.

146
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:02,160
- Are you all right?
- Wu Zhen, this isn't over!

147
00:12:06,440 --> 00:12:07,440
Shu.

148
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,920
My lord, keep it down.

149
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,560
Don't bring Lady Wu back.

150
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,240
What are you afraid of?

151
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:22,600
My lord.

152
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:32,520
Fu Xi.

153
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:35,680
You came here with Wu Zhen, didn't you?

154
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,840
Why did she kick me and leave?

155
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:39,040
You--

156
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:41,280
What's that sound?

157
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:42,400
You…

158
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,080
So you're here.

159
00:12:45,840 --> 00:12:46,880
Be careful!

160
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:49,160
It's me. Don't you remember me?

161
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,440
She's really possessed.

162
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:56,800
This is bad.

163
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,240
This isn't right.

164
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:03,720
These aren't real bats.

165
00:13:04,520 --> 00:13:05,560
It's demonic magic.

166
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:20,360
Let's go.

167
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,480
We meet again, Bat Demon.

168
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,480
Don't waste your effort.

169
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,600
Fu Xi

170
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:53,840
Cat Lord!

171
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,480
She made many mistakes,

172
00:13:56,040 --> 00:13:58,320
but please, at least spare her life.

173
00:13:58,400 --> 00:13:59,720
I won't kill her.

174
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:05,320
Cat Lord.

175
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
What's wrong with her?

176
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,120
After you left,

177
00:14:08,200 --> 00:14:11,840
she probably contracted something unclean
that corrupted her, causing evil thoughts.

178
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:13,240
That's why she hurt someone.

179
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,440
Someone cast a spell on her.

180
00:14:31,840 --> 00:14:33,520
Demon-Slaying Spell?

181
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:40,280
Young Master, are you all right?

182
00:14:40,360 --> 00:14:42,360
Are you hurt?

183
00:14:42,440 --> 00:14:43,480
Did someone bully you?

184
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,080
Tell me, I'll avenge you.

185
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,160
I'm fine.

186
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:48,840
Who is it?

187
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:52,200
Young Master, don't worry.

188
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:53,280
I'll just chase her away.

189
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,000
Don't hit her.

190
00:15:02,520 --> 00:15:04,720
Don't worry, I'm also fine now.

191
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:13,360
So you don't like cats.

192
00:15:13,880 --> 00:15:15,720
Please take her away.

193
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:17,160
My young master hates cats.

194
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,960
I guess

195
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,720
the cat will be sad.

196
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:29,800
Sir, you're here too.

197
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:32,800
I heard a bunch of bats flew here
for no reason.

198
00:15:34,040 --> 00:15:35,040
Is everyone all right?

199
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:37,720
- Lady Wu…
- Lady Wu was shocked.

200
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:39,200
She left a long time ago.

201
00:15:42,000 --> 00:15:43,120
It's getting late.

202
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:44,960
I'll go back and rest then.

203
00:15:49,120 --> 00:15:50,280
Who is he?

204
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,560
Lady Wu's good friend Mr. Shu,
who runs a bookstore in Chang'an.

205
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:58,160
But Wu Zhen gets shocked too.

206
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:08,640
Xiaozhen.

207
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,160
Here, have some candy.

208
00:16:13,120 --> 00:16:14,120
Shu.

209
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:15,440
When will she recover?

210
00:16:15,520 --> 00:16:17,880
You're still so impatient.

211
00:16:18,840 --> 00:16:20,160
I'm not impatient.

212
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:23,840
He is.

213
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:38,360
Fu Xi.

214
00:16:41,480 --> 00:16:43,840
Fu Xi, don't be angry.

215
00:16:50,200 --> 00:16:52,480
I didn't really want to abandon you.

216
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:54,080
We've been together for 100 years.

217
00:16:54,920 --> 00:16:56,920
It's just a bit boring.

218
00:17:03,480 --> 00:17:05,640
I just wanted to go out for a while.

219
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,040
Fu Xi.

220
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:27,200
It's only been two days since he left,
and you're already upset.

221
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,640
Why are you so impatient?

222
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:38,600
Earrings come in pairs.

223
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,000
One can't be missing from the pair.

224
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,120
Since we are a pair of earrings,
we should be together all the time.

225
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:49,520
Being together and inseparable

226
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:51,080
is touching.

227
00:17:52,360 --> 00:17:56,200
In this world,
not many things are matter-in-fact.

228
00:17:56,280 --> 00:17:59,080
Having souls and developing wisdom

229
00:17:59,160 --> 00:18:00,640
are already very rare.

230
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:03,360
How can it be meaningless

231
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:05,920
just because your partner's gone?

232
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:07,720
Bat Demon.

233
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:09,280
Our existence in this world

234
00:18:09,360 --> 00:18:12,000
aren't controlled by others or by destiny.

235
00:18:13,600 --> 00:18:16,240
Even if you're just a little earring,

236
00:18:16,320 --> 00:18:17,880
you should have significance.

237
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,000
Being alone in the world

238
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:25,240
and having company

239
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:27,920
are beautiful in their own way.

240
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:30,960
Fu Xi still has
her divine senses.

241
00:18:31,040 --> 00:18:35,280
After she recovers and Demon Underworld
punishes her for hurting others,

242
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,160
you two can stay in Demon Underworld

243
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,640
and live the life you want.

244
00:18:47,680 --> 00:18:49,120
Thank you, Cat Lord.

245
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:53,720
Wait.

246
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:55,360
Cat Lord.

247
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,840
I wasn't possessed

248
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:59,480
just because I lost my partner.

249
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,440
Maybe there's another reason.

250
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:05,560
- What is it?
- When I first came to Chang'an,

251
00:19:05,640 --> 00:19:07,720
I looked for him in the form of a bat.

252
00:19:07,800 --> 00:19:10,400
Unexpectedly, I returned to my form
one day and fell to the ground.

253
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:12,880
A Xiangsi House dancer found me.

254
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:14,960
As I was a bit damaged,

255
00:19:15,040 --> 00:19:17,480
she brought me
to a jewelry workshop in the city.

256
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:18,680
A jewelry workshop?

257
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,040
Yes.

258
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:21,720
At the jewelry workshop,

259
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:24,760
I felt an evil energy.

260
00:19:26,040 --> 00:19:27,320
It made me become unlike myself.

261
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,720
Why would there be
an evil energy in Chang'an?

262
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,840
I remember that evil energy's source was

263
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,440
a stone, a red stone.

264
00:19:37,160 --> 00:19:38,160
A stone?

265
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,320
Could it be the Bone Relic?

266
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:43,880
Bone Relic?

267
00:19:44,280 --> 00:19:45,400
What's that?

268
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,480
Bone Relic is the remnant
of someone with a grudge.

269
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:51,320
Wherever it is,
it often causes demonic changes.

270
00:19:51,680 --> 00:19:54,920
No matter whether you're human or demon,
you're easily bewitched by it.

271
00:19:55,200 --> 00:19:56,200
That means

272
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:59,960
we have to find the Bone Relic.

273
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
Mei Residence

274
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:23,480
Memorial tablet
of Yi Xuanqing and Mei Yuheng

275
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:35,680
Father.

276
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:37,640
Mother.

277
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:40,160
It's been 18 years.

278
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,080
Memorial tablet
of Yi Xuanqing and Mei Yuheng

279
00:20:42,160 --> 00:20:44,920
Why isn't Father back yet?

280
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,080
Your father?

281
00:20:46,160 --> 00:20:47,680
Mother of Mei

282
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,240
Maybe he has other matters to attend to.

283
00:20:49,320 --> 00:20:52,320
I'll only sleep after he reads to me.

284
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:53,960
Be good and go to sleep now.

285
00:20:54,040 --> 00:20:56,520
You'll see him when you wake up.

286
00:21:01,720 --> 00:21:02,720
Zhuyu.

287
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,200
I've told your father.

288
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:07,600
He's not allowed
to go anywhere this New Year's Eve.

289
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,040
Both of us

290
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:12,000
will play with you in the snow
in the mountains.

291
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,080
All right?

292
00:21:13,160 --> 00:21:14,160
All right.

293
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,440
I'll sleep now.

294
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:23,280
<i>It's been 18 years.</i>

295
00:21:25,680 --> 00:21:29,120
I've now entered the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations' record library.

296
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:31,240
I wonder if I can find any clues…

297
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:35,120
to uncover the truth

298
00:21:35,840 --> 00:21:38,160
behind the Heavenly Fire Disaster
back then.

299
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:48,840
Mother.

300
00:21:49,320 --> 00:21:50,320
<i>Think about it.</i>

301
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,360
If I hadn't gone to Quzhou,

302
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:55,720
Master wouldn't have taken me
as Changxi Palace's disciple.

303
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,800
I should've stayed away
from worldly affairs.

304
00:22:00,680 --> 00:22:02,640
But before Master died, he said

305
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:06,600
that your deaths probably
weren't from natural causes,

306
00:22:08,600 --> 00:22:10,280
but caused by demons.

307
00:22:11,600 --> 00:22:12,800
I came back to Chang'an

308
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:15,080
to find the truth for you.

309
00:22:16,280 --> 00:22:18,080
No matter how hard and dangerous it is…

310
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,680
I'll surely avenge you.

311
00:22:31,160 --> 00:22:32,160
What?

312
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:33,400
Zhen'er chose someone?

313
00:22:36,600 --> 00:22:38,160
Hey.

314
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:41,600
This is great news.

315
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:44,320
It's that easy?

316
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:47,040
Why do I feel like there's
something fishy about it?

317
00:22:47,120 --> 00:22:50,960
At the birthday banquet two days ago,
Lady Wu chose him in front of everyone.

318
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:52,600
I heard

319
00:22:52,680 --> 00:22:54,400
she even dragged him in private

320
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:55,920
and spent a long time with him.

321
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,760
In private?

322
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:01,760
He's so capable?

323
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:03,320
What's his background?

324
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,880
He just came to Chang'an.

325
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,520
His name is Mei Zhuyu.

326
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,560
His surname is Mei?

327
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:12,080
Ah! He's from
the Mei family's side branch.

328
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:14,040
He should be

329
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:16,760
Noble Consort Mei's distant cousin.

330
00:23:18,200 --> 00:23:21,480
Zhen'er has been free-spirited
for so long.

331
00:23:21,560 --> 00:23:23,680
How can a young man

332
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,920
who just came to Chang'an manipulate her?

333
00:23:26,440 --> 00:23:28,560
- Well…
- I don't believe it.

334
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:30,120
What's his strength?

335
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,880
That's right. What's his strength?

336
00:23:33,480 --> 00:23:36,000
His strength? Ah!

337
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:37,240
Come on.

338
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:53,480
You have such a handsome man
in your family?

339
00:23:53,560 --> 00:23:56,040
We have such a good-looking man
in our family?

340
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,600
I knew it.

341
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:08,680
I know my sister quite well.

342
00:24:09,280 --> 00:24:11,840
Why did she focus
on one person so quickly?

343
00:24:11,920 --> 00:24:13,520
She's just

344
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:15,760
being playful and lecherous.

345
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:17,600
That's what she would do.

346
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:22,120
Lady Wu might just be
playing around for a couple of days,

347
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:25,120
but there's one thing I dare not report.

348
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:26,960
What is it? Tell me.

349
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:31,280
He works in the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations.

350
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,120
Bureau of Mystic Investigations?

351
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:36,920
He's just a mediocre official.

352
00:24:37,000 --> 00:24:40,720
He relies on his looks,
and he's also a freeloader.

353
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,720
Noble Consort Mei.

354
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,000
Discipline your family member.

355
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,120
Boss.

356
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Don't worry, Boss.

357
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:58,480
Zhe Liu is all right now.

358
00:24:58,560 --> 00:25:00,840
She'll be fine after taking
some calming medicine.

359
00:25:02,280 --> 00:25:03,920
Did the Bureau of Mystic Investigations
suspect anything?

360
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,440
No. They said bats hidden
on Xiangsi House's roof

361
00:25:08,520 --> 00:25:10,440
stole the earrings.

362
00:25:11,000 --> 00:25:14,520
Bureau of Mystic Investigations' Xu Luan
is frightened by the bat rumors.

363
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,000
He said since no one was killed,
he doesn't want to investigate further.

364
00:25:18,920 --> 00:25:22,120
By the way, Boss,
I just got some news.

365
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,840
I'm afraid you won't like it.

366
00:25:25,920 --> 00:25:28,440
- What is it?
- Eunuch Feng left the palace

367
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:30,280
to head to the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations.

368
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,440
Her Majesty is summoning Young Master Mei.

369
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:34,160
- What?
- Mm.

370
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:37,320
Young Master.

371
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Young Master!

372
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:42,600
Young Master.

373
00:25:42,680 --> 00:25:45,000
The Hu cake shop next door
is popular indeed.

374
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:47,200
I woke up early to line up
and only got this much.

375
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:48,520
It's enough.

376
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:50,800
Young Master.

377
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:52,840
Since this is
for the Bureau of Mystic Investigations,

378
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:55,120
that Xu guy

379
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:58,080
will reimburse it, right?

380
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,920
Don't worry.

381
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:02,080
That's good.

382
00:26:02,160 --> 00:26:03,440
We're already poor.

383
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:05,920
I give you two-thirds

384
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,400
of my monthly salary.

385
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:08,880
How can you say we're poor?

386
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:11,640
What do you mean, Young Master?

387
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:15,240
I work so hard every day
without complaints

388
00:26:15,320 --> 00:26:17,440
to serve you well.

389
00:26:18,600 --> 00:26:20,360
Aren't you touched at all?

390
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:23,080
It's not that.

391
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:24,440
Then are you going to deduct my salary?

392
00:26:24,520 --> 00:26:25,520
No.

393
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,440
Mr. Mei, bad news!

394
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,840
Hurry, go to the Bureau
of Mystic Investigations!

395
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,120
- What's wrong?
- Something big happened.

396
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,840
The Bureau of Mystic Investigations
is trashed!

397
00:26:37,600 --> 00:26:39,440
Bureau Of Mystic Investigations

398
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:42,520
Go.

399
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:24,720
Lady Wu, what are you doing?

400
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,080
Don't you understand, Mr. Mei?

401
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:29,960
I'm angry.

402
00:27:30,440 --> 00:27:31,600
Why are you angry?

403
00:27:31,680 --> 00:27:34,840
I'm angry at you, of course.

404
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:37,520
Because of you,

405
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,120
I came to this lousy
Bureau of Mystic Investigations

406
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:42,040
and almost got hurt by a bat.

407
00:27:44,080 --> 00:27:45,880
But you're ungrateful.

408
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:48,280
You've ignored my advances.

409
00:27:53,200 --> 00:27:55,280
Forget it
if you don't want to be with me.

410
00:27:56,280 --> 00:27:57,440
I won't force you.

411
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,640
From now on,
I have nothing to do with you.

412
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:05,560
Don't let me see you again.

413
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:16,720
That's enough.

414
00:28:16,800 --> 00:28:18,440
Stop looking. Go.

415
00:28:18,520 --> 00:28:20,600
Stop watching. Go home.

416
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:22,280
It's all your fault!

417
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:24,800
You're short-sighted!

418
00:28:25,400 --> 00:28:26,760
You're a troublemaker!

419
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:27,960
You…

420
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,920
My treasures.

421
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:35,040
Don't force relationship matters.

422
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,600
No wonder they say
County Princess Qinghe

423
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:42,840
is vain and overbearing.

424
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:45,480
She caused so much trouble
just to get close to you.

425
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:47,120
It's fine.

426
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:51,160
Maybe Lady Wu just likes to tease people.

427
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,160
We'll just stay out of each other's way.

428
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,680
If you ask me,

429
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,200
why rush to put on this show?

430
00:29:04,280 --> 00:29:05,920
Just let the Empress summon him.

431
00:29:06,360 --> 00:29:10,000
I didn't want to get deeply involved
with that mortal anyway.

432
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:12,720
And my sister is impatient.

433
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,320
If I wait any longer,

434
00:29:14,400 --> 00:29:16,280
I don't know
how much trouble it will cause.

435
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,320
Better to end it as soon as possible.

436
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:20,840
Young Master Mei might be weak,

437
00:29:20,920 --> 00:29:22,320
but he's so good-looking.

438
00:29:22,400 --> 00:29:23,720
Can you really bear to part with him?

439
00:29:23,800 --> 00:29:25,320
Flowers don't bloom forever.

440
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:29,000
Just admire and play
with the pretty flowers,

441
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:31,560
no need to trouble yourself to pick them.

442
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:33,680
Hmm…

443
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:37,640
What's going on?

444
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:40,080
My lady, the road is blocked.

445
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:43,560
Who dares to block Lady Wu's way?

446
00:29:46,560 --> 00:29:47,640
She's back.

447
00:29:53,440 --> 00:29:57,360
Liu Taizhen, Daughter of Liu Manor,
Demon Underworld Snake Lord

448
00:29:59,120 --> 00:30:00,640
Long time no see, Lady Liu.

449
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:03,520
It has indeed been a while.

450
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:06,120
I missed your show.

451
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,600
What should we do then?

452
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:10,760
I'll perform again for you.

453
00:30:11,520 --> 00:30:12,520
Sure.

454
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,520
Young Master,
Young Master Mei Si is here.

455
00:30:38,240 --> 00:30:40,200
<i>Mei Si? Why are you here?</i>

456
00:30:40,520 --> 00:30:43,000
<i>Everyone in Chang'an</i>
<i>is crazily talking about you.</i>

457
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:45,440
What are they saying?

458
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:47,360
They said

459
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:51,240
it was love at first sight for Wu Zhen
at the birthday banquet.

460
00:30:51,320 --> 00:30:54,560
To get involved with you,
she pretended to report a case

461
00:30:54,640 --> 00:30:58,360
to come to the Bureau of Mystic
Investigations to give herself to you.

462
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:01,800
But you didn't know how to cherish her.

463
00:31:01,880 --> 00:31:03,680
You'd rather die than submit.

464
00:31:03,760 --> 00:31:05,440
You disregarded County Princess Qinghe

465
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:07,040
and laid an ambush in Xiangsi House

466
00:31:07,120 --> 00:31:09,000
to investigate the bat disaster.

467
00:31:09,080 --> 00:31:11,240
And Lady Wu's advances never worked,

468
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:14,120
so she was furious and made trouble
at the Bureau of Mystic Investigations,

469
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:15,840
saying she wants to cut ties with you.

470
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:20,680
How can they speak such nonsense
about a woman's chastity?

471
00:31:21,640 --> 00:31:24,720
It doesn't matter. Chastity?

472
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,200
Wu Zhen doesn't care about that.

473
00:31:26,280 --> 00:31:27,320
Yes.

474
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:28,880
I just heard

475
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,640
that County Princess Qinghe and her rival,

476
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:33,640
Lady Liu,

477
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:36,600
got into a fight on the street
over something trivial.

478
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:38,080
People are gossiping about them.

479
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:39,920
Lady Liu?

480
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,720
- She's back in Chang'an?
- Yes.

481
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:43,960
Who is Lady Liu?

482
00:31:44,640 --> 00:31:48,000
The daughter of Minister Liu Gongshen.

483
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:50,280
My…

484
00:31:51,280 --> 00:31:52,280
fiancée.

485
00:31:56,560 --> 00:31:58,400
Ruyi House

486
00:32:14,520 --> 00:32:15,760
Don't scare me.

487
00:32:23,160 --> 00:32:24,520
I haven't seen you for a few days,

488
00:32:25,120 --> 00:32:27,240
and this is how you welcome me?

489
00:32:28,360 --> 00:32:29,440
What's the matter?

490
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:31,800
You went to pray with the Liu family,

491
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:33,880
but were so bored at the temple,

492
00:32:33,960 --> 00:32:36,280
so you've become lively
since you came back?

493
00:32:37,440 --> 00:32:41,680
Is there really nothing going on
between you and Young Master Mei?

494
00:32:41,760 --> 00:32:43,200
What could be going on?

495
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:46,200
If you really don't like Young Master Mei,

496
00:32:46,280 --> 00:32:49,520
why would you trade
your good reputation for his?

497
00:32:50,080 --> 00:32:51,280
I have a good reputation?

498
00:32:59,200 --> 00:33:01,160
I used him once, after all.

499
00:33:01,240 --> 00:33:04,120
As demons, we should have some conscience.

500
00:33:05,480 --> 00:33:07,040
Besides, I don't care about this.

501
00:33:07,720 --> 00:33:08,880
I heard that yesterday,

502
00:33:09,600 --> 00:33:11,360
someone secretly used a talisman

503
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:14,080
to disperse the bat colony
and hurt the mother bat.

504
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:18,320
You heard about it too?

505
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:20,480
It's such a big deal.

506
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:24,840
The demon slayers that have been gone
for years are lured out.

507
00:33:25,280 --> 00:33:26,560
It's really interesting.

508
00:33:27,280 --> 00:33:29,600
We need to be careful then.

509
00:33:30,120 --> 00:33:31,440
It's a big world.

510
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,720
It's normal
that there are still cultivators.

511
00:33:34,600 --> 00:33:36,800
As long as
they're not Changxi Palace's scoundrels.

512
00:33:37,280 --> 00:33:40,200
Changxi Palace has been gone
for a century.

513
00:33:40,320 --> 00:33:42,160
You're always thinking about them.

514
00:33:42,400 --> 00:33:46,600
The Changxi weapon
can slay all demons in the world.

515
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:50,080
This wound

516
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:53,280
constantly reminds me to be alert.

517
00:33:58,840 --> 00:34:00,320
If they are still around,

518
00:34:00,520 --> 00:34:02,320
the Changxi Palace and Demon Market

519
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,720
will surely have a life-or-death battle.

520
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:37,120
Who is it?

521
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:45,280
Who is it?

522
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:51,600
Who is it?

523
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,720
Stop hiding.

524
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:55,800
Stop!

525
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,360
Ghosts!

526
00:35:45,640 --> 00:35:48,720
County Princess is so generous.

527
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:52,920
She only broke a corner of my front hall,

528
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:56,280
but is repairing the entire
Bureau of Mystic Investigations.

529
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:58,600
Good job trashing the place.

530
00:35:58,680 --> 00:36:00,120
Do it again next time.

531
00:36:00,480 --> 00:36:02,280
Good job trashing the place.

532
00:36:02,360 --> 00:36:04,280
Do it again next time.

533
00:36:08,200 --> 00:36:09,520
Commander Xu.

534
00:36:09,600 --> 00:36:11,440
If I weren't so lucky,

535
00:36:11,520 --> 00:36:14,040
I would have been killed
by that demon last night.

536
00:36:14,120 --> 00:36:15,200
Commander,

537
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,920
Bureau of Mystic Investigations,
please save me.

538
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:20,240
What are you talking about?

539
00:36:20,360 --> 00:36:22,760
You're alive and kicking, aren't you?

540
00:36:22,840 --> 00:36:24,080
- I--
- Who wants to harm you?

541
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:27,320
- I get it now.
- Huh?

542
00:36:27,400 --> 00:36:28,640
You must have heard that

543
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:31,280
The Bureau of Mystic Investigations
recently solved a bizarre case.

544
00:36:31,840 --> 00:36:32,840
That's why

545
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:36,240
you came up with this weird rhetoric

546
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:38,320
to make a big deal out of it

547
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,200
and cause trouble
at the Bureau of Mystic Investigations.

548
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:45,120
Your goal is to attract customers
for your little workshop. Am I right?

549
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:47,080
What are you talking about?

550
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:48,640
- I--
- That's enough.

551
00:36:49,480 --> 00:36:53,600
Ever since I solved the bat case, right?

552
00:36:54,520 --> 00:36:57,200
I've met a lot of strange people
like you every day.

553
00:36:57,280 --> 00:36:59,160
- No.
- How can I not see through

554
00:36:59,240 --> 00:37:01,360
- this minor trick?
- I…

555
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:04,720
People like you are despicable!

556
00:37:05,400 --> 00:37:06,400
I can't stand it!

557
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:08,080
- But I--
- But what?

558
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:12,000
If you don't stop nagging,
I'll arrest you!

559
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,240
I…

560
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:28,520
Yuzhen Pavilion

561
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:30,640
Living in the Wild

562
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:33,240
Little Kitty.

563
00:37:34,120 --> 00:37:35,240
Smell this.

564
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:38,480
Its incense is made
from a 100-year-old agarwood bone.

565
00:37:38,560 --> 00:37:39,800
It refreshes the mind.

566
00:37:39,880 --> 00:37:41,280
It's also made into a balm.

567
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,880
Apply it on your forehead
to relieve fatigue, very energizing.

568
00:37:49,360 --> 00:37:50,360
Boss.

569
00:37:51,720 --> 00:37:53,280
It is refreshing.

570
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,560
But this smell is too strong.

571
00:37:55,920 --> 00:37:57,960
It is quite hard to sell.

572
00:37:58,520 --> 00:38:00,280
Since it's energizing and refreshing,

573
00:38:01,120 --> 00:38:04,920
say it's a good product for candidates
preparing for the exam.

574
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:08,320
For candidates preparing for the exam?

575
00:38:08,720 --> 00:38:09,720
Good idea.

576
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,000
Since it's my boss's idea,

577
00:38:12,360 --> 00:38:14,920
shouldn't you give us 20% of Ruyi House?

578
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,760
Dream on.

579
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:19,480
"Dream on."

580
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:21,120
Beauty Ling Xiao.

581
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:22,920
Your Snake Master is so petty.

582
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:24,480
There's no future with her.

583
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:27,400
Why don't you work for me?

584
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,240
Cat Lord favors me so much.

585
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:33,000
I am…

586
00:38:33,560 --> 00:38:34,720
so unmoved.

587
00:38:36,040 --> 00:38:37,960
Because only my lady is in my heart.

588
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:41,200
Young Master Mei Si has arrived.

589
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:46,000
If Ruyi House is
for food and fun,

590
00:38:46,080 --> 00:38:48,480
Yuzhen Pavilion is for elegance.

591
00:38:48,560 --> 00:38:50,920
The literati and scholars come here
to enjoy incense and meet friends.

592
00:38:51,480 --> 00:38:53,280
I buy all my incense here.

593
00:38:53,360 --> 00:38:54,520
Young Master Mei Si.

594
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,600
The usual seat.

595
00:38:56,760 --> 00:38:57,960
I'm sorry, Mei Si.

596
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,360
The second floor's
private rooms are full.

597
00:39:00,120 --> 00:39:01,720
Wait, someone even reserved

598
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,120
my private room in advance?

599
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:06,720
Please wait
at an open table first.

600
00:39:11,560 --> 00:39:12,720
Little Zhuyu.

601
00:39:14,840 --> 00:39:16,080
Wu Zhen.

602
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,840
Lady Liu?

603
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,920
Is that my Lady Liu?

604
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:31,640
Wu Zhen, I think I just saw Lady Liu.

605
00:39:31,720 --> 00:39:33,800
Lady Liu's not here.

606
00:39:36,320 --> 00:39:37,680
Lady Liu.

607
00:39:38,360 --> 00:39:39,440
Lady Liu.

608
00:39:40,520 --> 00:39:42,320
I'm hallucinating again.

609
00:39:42,400 --> 00:39:43,760
Stop searching.

610
00:39:44,600 --> 00:39:46,600
Can she hide underground?

611
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:48,120
Wu Zhen.

612
00:39:48,760 --> 00:39:51,320
By the way, Wu Zhen,
what brings you to Yuzhen Pavilion?

613
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:53,320
Don't you dislike rouge and powder?

614
00:39:53,840 --> 00:39:55,400
Besides, this is Lady Liu's shop.

615
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:58,720
You know it's my rival's shop,

616
00:39:59,360 --> 00:40:00,960
yet you keep spending money here.

617
00:40:01,520 --> 00:40:03,000
It seems like Lady Liu

618
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:05,640
is more important to you than me.

619
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,480
Wu Zhen, I was wrong.

620
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,640
After all, Lady Liu is my…

621
00:40:15,720 --> 00:40:17,800
Wu Zhen, I swear.

622
00:40:17,880 --> 00:40:19,840
I'm completely loyal to you.

623
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:25,040
All right. Wrap it up for me.

624
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:35,400
Isn't this the Mei family's young master
from the Bureau of Mystic Investigations?

625
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:39,200
What's your name?

626
00:40:40,000 --> 00:40:41,080
Mei Zhuyu.

627
00:40:41,600 --> 00:40:43,960
It's hard to remember your name.

628
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:46,680
If you can't remember it,
it means you're not smart.

629
00:40:46,760 --> 00:40:48,040
Just forget about it.

630
00:40:50,520 --> 00:40:52,760
Young Master Mei,

631
00:40:53,320 --> 00:40:55,920
I heard County Princess Qinghe
used and abandoned you.

632
00:40:56,000 --> 00:40:58,000
How pitiful.

633
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:00,840
But it makes sense.

634
00:41:00,920 --> 00:41:02,480
She has seen a lot of men.

635
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:04,600
And you're inexperienced.

636
00:41:04,680 --> 00:41:05,960
How could she not dump you?

637
00:41:07,240 --> 00:41:08,240
What's the matter?

638
00:41:08,800 --> 00:41:11,560
Did you come to Yuzhen Pavilion today
to buy some incense

639
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:13,720
to win Lady Wu's favor again?

640
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:19,840
Why don't I give you a tip?

641
00:41:20,720 --> 00:41:22,200
I heard that Yuzhen Pavilion

642
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:25,000
also has an aphrodisiac incense.

643
00:41:25,080 --> 00:41:26,920
Why don't you buy some?

644
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
You…

645
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:33,360
Living in the Wild

646
00:44:14,360 --> 00:44:16,320
