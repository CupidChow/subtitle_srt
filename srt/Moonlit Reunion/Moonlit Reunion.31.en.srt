00:01:27,127 --> 00:01:30,968
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,880
(Episode 31)

3
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:39,689
(Duke Wu's Residence)

4
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:52,965
I sense a demonic aura.

5
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,846
Zhen, you're back!

6
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:05,085
My daughter is still the best!

7
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,446
You always warm my heart...

8
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,326
Did she buy this for me?

9
00:03:18,680 --> 00:03:19,743
All this...

10
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:34,406
Wait. What's going on here?

11
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:48,406
But why?

12
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:01,446
Isn't that Lady Liu?

13
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:03,886
It is.

14
00:04:05,759 --> 00:04:08,959
I heard that Princess Qing He had an argument with Commissioner Mei.

15
00:04:09,039 --> 00:04:12,765
Lady Liu came to visit him right after Her Highness moved out of his house.

16
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:17,125
Say, Commissioner Mei is a lucky man indeed.

17
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:19,746
If so, he's truly...

18
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,125
Just keep it to yourself. Do not tell anyone about it.

19
00:04:23,519 --> 00:04:24,582
Let's enjoy our tea.

20
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,423
Lady Liu?

21
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,063
Fourth Brother, you're here.

22
00:04:46,839 --> 00:04:50,286
Little Fish, please save me!

23
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,080
I can't take it anymore!

24
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:55,086
It's killing me!

25
00:05:12,839 --> 00:05:13,902
This is useless!

26
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:22,526
It's pointless to hold it up high.

27
00:05:23,365 --> 00:05:25,772
Right now, there's no way to change our bodies back.

28
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,114
You've known me for many years. I assume you know me well.

29
00:05:44,199 --> 00:05:46,925
This is a huge deal.

30
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:51,406
Before we find a way to get our bodies back,

31
00:05:52,399 --> 00:05:56,565
no one else must know about our predicament except for Wu Zhen,

32
00:05:57,680 --> 00:05:59,406
Mei Zhu Yu, and my trusted aides in the Demon City.

33
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,685
Therefore, you need to pretend to be Lady Liu and Serpent Lord.

34
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:12,526
Does that mean I have to enter the Demon City?

35
00:06:14,879 --> 00:06:16,766
You always wanted to enter the Demon City, right?

36
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:19,423
Now, your wish is granted.

37
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:24,223
Lady Liu!

38
00:06:25,677 --> 00:06:30,116
Little Fish, now, not only do I have to pretend to be a noble lady,

39
00:06:30,263 --> 00:06:32,269
but I also have to pretend to be the leader of the demons!

40
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:36,080
I cannot withstand this pressure!

41
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,942
- Fourth Brother, please get up. This is inappropriate.   - No way!

42
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,805
No one else is here anyway!

43
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:43,766
Hurry and come up with a solution for me!

44
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:47,743
Wen Hua?

45
00:06:49,319 --> 00:06:50,766
No wonder Lady Wu Zhen left the residence!

46
00:06:56,199 --> 00:06:57,726
What has this got to do with me?

47
00:07:01,519 --> 00:07:02,766
Isn't that Duke Wu?

48
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,439
- Why did he take a rod with him?   - Is something going to happen?

49
00:07:05,519 --> 00:07:06,582
Liu Gong Shen!

50
00:07:08,079 --> 00:07:09,142
Come down!

51
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:12,726
Liu Gong Shen, are the rumors true?

52
00:07:12,959 --> 00:07:15,685
Did your daughter steal my son-in-law from my daughter?

53
00:07:15,839 --> 00:07:19,720
I only just heard about this myself. But my daughter isn't such a person.

54
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,166
You dare to say that?

55
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:23,360
At the entrance of the alley.

56
00:07:23,439 --> 00:07:25,640
Your daughter's carriage is parked there.

57
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:27,606
How dare you still deny the truth?

58
00:07:28,399 --> 00:07:29,766
Your Grace, please calm down.

59
00:07:29,867 --> 00:07:32,913
I won't forgive her if she sabotages your daughter's marriage.

60
00:07:33,036 --> 00:07:35,922
But it's pointless for us to argue here.

61
00:07:36,424 --> 00:07:38,670
Why don't we go to his residence and check it out?

62
00:07:39,918 --> 00:07:41,740
- Let's go!   - Please.

63
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,623
Stop right there!

64
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,239
We mustn't give them time to prepare themselves.

65
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:50,805
We must catch them red-handed by surprise.

66
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:55,262
Open.

67
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:03,966
Open!

68
00:08:04,079 --> 00:08:05,142
The door is open.

69
00:08:10,199 --> 00:08:15,086
Little Fish, you're a Celestial Master. Can't you come up with a solution?

70
00:08:17,040 --> 00:08:18,103
I'll give it a try.

71
00:08:23,462 --> 00:08:26,404
(Pure Heart)

72
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:36,725
Stop right there!

73
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,720
Why is this happening to my daughter?

74
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:43,439
This must be karma!

75
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:44,582
You!

76
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,685
How dare you cheat on my daughter?

77
00:08:48,799 --> 00:08:51,520
That's not it. This is a misunderstanding.

78
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,663
A misunderstanding?

79
00:08:52,759 --> 00:08:55,605
The two of you were in a confined chamber alone.

80
00:08:55,840 --> 00:08:59,205
And he was doing this.

81
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:01,766
How dare you say that it's a misunderstanding?

82
00:09:05,559 --> 00:09:08,205
You! Tai Zhen!

83
00:09:09,759 --> 00:09:10,822
You...

84
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:12,503
You're ridiculous...

85
00:09:16,519 --> 00:09:17,582
Minister Liu!

86
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:19,783
This is...

87
00:09:28,777 --> 00:09:31,703
So, Lady Liu didn't stand between

88
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,965
your relationship with Zhen, huh?

89
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,006
If so, why are you two getting a divorce?

90
00:09:38,495 --> 00:09:41,061
It was my fault. I made her upset.

91
00:09:46,003 --> 00:09:49,809
I understand Zhen's temper well. It's not your fault.

92
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:52,497
It's my fault this time.

93
00:09:58,600 --> 00:10:02,373
Are you sure you're here to seek a diagnosis from Commissioner Mei

94
00:10:02,841 --> 00:10:04,566
and try to persuade them to get back together?

95
00:10:04,813 --> 00:10:06,011
I swear!

96
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:13,138
Little Fish and I...

97
00:10:15,032 --> 00:10:16,157
I mean, Commissioner Mei.

98
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:19,766
There's nothing between us.

99
00:10:21,079 --> 00:10:22,885
I'm glad to hear that.

100
00:10:23,481 --> 00:10:24,927
I can rest at ease now.

101
00:10:25,542 --> 00:10:29,308
I know that Fourth Master Si is unreliable.

102
00:10:30,512 --> 00:10:33,078
He's inferior to Commissioner Mei.

103
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,120
I understand why you're unsatisfied with him.

104
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:39,965
Wait a minute. How is that understandable?

105
00:10:40,159 --> 00:10:41,222
This has nothing to do with me...

106
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,406
This has nothing to do with Fourth Master Si.

107
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:51,046
Are you sure you're my daughter?

108
00:10:54,080 --> 00:10:57,406
Why are you speaking up for Fourth Master Si now?

109
00:11:07,376 --> 00:11:10,502
(Ruyi Pavilion)

110
00:11:15,759 --> 00:11:17,126
Great job.

111
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:18,805
In just one day,

112
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:20,305
from a noble lady, I turned into a vixen

113
00:11:20,385 --> 00:11:22,565
who sabotaged other people's relationships.

114
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,526
I've established and maintained a good reputation for ten years.

115
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:30,574
Fourth Master Si, you ruined it in just one day.

116
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,445
You're truly capable.

117
00:11:35,559 --> 00:11:39,046
What about Duke Wu? Have you asked him how to get our bodies back?

118
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,605
That unreliable father of mine was thinking the entire night. He...

119
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,079
That unreliable father of mine was thinking the entire night.

120
00:11:55,159 --> 00:11:58,565
He finally remembered what the doll seller told him.

121
00:11:59,261 --> 00:12:00,324
What did he say?

122
00:12:00,679 --> 00:12:05,046
He said one could exchange one's body with one's beloved with the figurine.

123
00:12:05,639 --> 00:12:09,085
One can get their body back when the other party falls in love with them.

124
00:12:11,879 --> 00:12:12,942
Do you want to give it a try?

125
00:12:14,151 --> 00:12:15,476
Are you kidding me?

126
00:12:15,694 --> 00:12:16,757
I'll give it a try!

127
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,406
What did Duke Wu say?

128
00:12:19,948 --> 00:12:21,114
I don't want my body back.

129
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:27,535
It's fine for me to keep assuming the identity of Fourth Master Si.

130
00:12:36,173 --> 00:12:37,738
I'll come up with another solution.

131
00:12:38,508 --> 00:12:39,536
Fourth Master Si,

132
00:12:39,617 --> 00:12:42,238
return to the Demon City and assume your role as Serpent Lord.

133
00:12:43,764 --> 00:12:45,404
Can I choose not to?

134
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,646
The Demon City is terrifying.

135
00:12:47,960 --> 00:12:49,965
I'll kick you and send you back with force if I have to.

136
00:12:51,355 --> 00:12:52,537
You should forget it.

137
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
When you kick him, it'll be like kicking yourself.

138
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,685
Cat Lord, do you require any help?

139
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:59,085
No need for that. I can walk by myself.

140
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:16,356
Miss Zhen, what solution were you referring to?

141
00:13:16,713 --> 00:13:20,079
The key to that solution lies with Lady Liu.

142
00:13:20,159 --> 00:13:21,486
I can't say for sure.

143
00:13:25,559 --> 00:13:26,685
Cat Lord.

144
00:13:27,039 --> 00:13:28,166
Serpent Lord.

145
00:13:33,679 --> 00:13:35,085
You're the Serpent Lord now.

146
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:36,646
You have to mind your conduct.

147
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:41,166
Enough already. Your hot spring is so stuffy.

148
00:13:41,280 --> 00:13:43,320
- No one will go there.   - How dare you steal my business?

149
00:13:43,448 --> 00:13:44,728
Who said I stole your business?

150
00:13:44,840 --> 00:13:47,401
What? Are you saying that you didn't do it on purpose?

151
00:13:47,481 --> 00:13:49,000
Do you think I'm trying to argue with you on purpose?

152
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:51,085
How dare you guys steal my business?

153
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:53,520
Do you dare to open the door and show everyone

154
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:55,400
that your hot spring is better than mine?

155
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:57,366
Why are they fighting for business?

156
00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:58,783
That's normal.

157
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:01,845
Humans fight for business. Demons do the same.

158
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:06,646
It's my first time seeing demons fighting for business.

159
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:08,000
I'll develop two more new dishes!

160
00:14:08,080 --> 00:14:10,126
Potato with stewed toad!

161
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:14,685
Why don't you take a look, then? I'm afraid this is your only chance.

162
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,679
You do have a point. I'll go and take a look.

163
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:19,445
I'm telling you, the business war has begun!

164
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,246
Fine by me!

165
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,565
Serpent Lord.

166
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,845
Serpent Lord.

167
00:14:30,679 --> 00:14:33,479
Serpent Lord, it's common for conflicts to occur when doing business.

168
00:14:33,559 --> 00:14:35,760
Serpent Lord, you don't need to trouble yourself.

169
00:14:35,840 --> 00:14:37,725
Miss Zhen!

170
00:14:49,879 --> 00:14:50,942
Cat Lord!

171
00:14:53,039 --> 00:14:54,079
What happened?

172
00:14:54,159 --> 00:14:55,222
Is she okay?

173
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:07,952
What's wrong?

174
00:15:08,759 --> 00:15:10,766
How long do you intend to hide this from me

175
00:15:11,919 --> 00:15:13,605
had I not stumbled upon it by accident today?

176
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:18,303
I didn't intend to hide this from you.

177
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:21,725
I get hurt occasionally when I apprehend demons.

178
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,166
I can't just complain about it to you all the time, right?

179
00:15:25,039 --> 00:15:26,246
Since when did this happen?

180
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:32,085
After the incident with Changxi Palace.

181
00:15:32,919 --> 00:15:34,766
You won't recover from this just by resting and recuperating.

182
00:15:35,720 --> 00:15:37,205
He's going overboard!

183
00:15:42,519 --> 00:15:46,000
Serpent Lord, are you here to look for Cat Lord?

184
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,143
Why aren't you heading inside?

185
00:15:52,879 --> 00:15:54,445
Hey, I did nothing.

186
00:15:57,000 --> 00:15:58,605
They're growing.

187
00:16:02,840 --> 00:16:04,046
What's wrong with me?

188
00:16:05,048 --> 00:16:06,186
Your Cat Lord power has already surpassed

189
00:16:06,266 --> 00:16:07,895
what your mortal body can withstand.

190
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:10,805
This isn't just a normal bruise.

191
00:16:12,159 --> 00:16:13,222
It's a demonic sore.

192
00:16:14,159 --> 00:16:15,805
It's due to the Life Transforming Art.

193
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:17,383
Zhen.

194
00:16:19,039 --> 00:16:23,822
You can no longer keep your mortal body.

195
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:30,822
But don't you worry.

196
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:35,445
I won't let anything happen to you no matter what.

197
00:17:02,064 --> 00:17:03,990
Little Fish!

198
00:17:06,960 --> 00:17:08,526
It's locked.

199
00:17:28,359 --> 00:17:30,360
(Father, Mother.)

200
00:17:32,481 --> 00:17:34,327
(I've been waiting for the truth for over a decade.)

201
00:17:36,223 --> 00:17:38,309
(But I never expected the truth)

202
00:17:40,352 --> 00:17:41,757
(to be something like this.)

203
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,192
(The enemy I wish to seek revenge upon)

204
00:17:46,272 --> 00:17:48,335
(is actually within my beloved's body.)

205
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,645
(Tell me.)

206
00:17:55,200 --> 00:17:57,125
(What exactly should I do?)

207
00:18:04,359 --> 00:18:06,199
Help! Young Master!

208
00:18:06,279 --> 00:18:07,342
What's wrong with you again?

209
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,263
Get up!

210
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:16,325
You told me not to open the door for Lady Liu.

211
00:18:16,440 --> 00:18:18,766
But she climbed the tree,

212
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:21,400
jumped, and landed on me.

213
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:23,920
Who knew that the branch would break?

214
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,885
It looked sturdy, you know?

215
00:18:26,079 --> 00:18:27,142
You...

216
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:35,686
At this point, no one can stop it from breaking.

217
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,239
Right now, you have an awkward identity. Why have you returned again?

218
00:18:43,319 --> 00:18:46,006
I swear. This time, I came here for proper business.

219
00:18:46,440 --> 00:18:47,726
I'm here to deliver news to you.

220
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:49,463
What news?

221
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,526
Miss Zhen has fallen ill.

222
00:18:57,638 --> 00:18:58,681
Really?

223
00:18:58,839 --> 00:18:59,902
Really.

224
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,645
That's what I heard.

225
00:19:01,920 --> 00:19:04,526
But I don't know the exact situation.

226
00:19:05,279 --> 00:19:06,342
You!

227
00:20:02,880 --> 00:20:04,800
(Ruyi Pavilion)

228
00:20:05,256 --> 00:20:09,615
So, Fourth Master Si persuaded demons to stop arguing in the Demon City.

229
00:20:09,759 --> 00:20:10,926
He even made friends there, huh?

230
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:14,959
At first, he was kind of terrified. He was doing much better this morning.

231
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,686
Maybe he has grown more courageous after spending a night there.

232
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,085
I suddenly feel like Little Serpent would be pretty adorable

233
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,680
with a personality like Fourth Master Si.

234
00:20:33,559 --> 00:20:35,805
It seems you find joy in watching my plight, huh?

235
00:20:36,279 --> 00:20:37,805
Why don't you worry about yourself?

236
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:47,085
Boss, what's wrong?

237
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,726
Nothing. I just feel tired.

238
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,405
After all, I've just performed the Life Transforming Art.

239
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,006
Is that truly the case?

240
00:20:57,279 --> 00:20:58,526
But your expression is...

241
00:20:59,119 --> 00:21:00,365
Don't worry for nothing.

242
00:21:01,119 --> 00:21:02,365
I was just choking on the grapes.

243
00:21:21,359 --> 00:21:22,926
I'm heading to Yuzhen Parlour later.

244
00:21:23,367 --> 00:21:24,653
Boss, let me send you there, then.

245
00:21:28,717 --> 00:21:29,718
What's the matter?

246
00:21:29,799 --> 00:21:30,862
What's the matter?

247
00:21:31,920 --> 00:21:34,622
I suddenly remember that I have something else to do.

248
00:21:35,440 --> 00:21:36,605
You guys should leave first.

249
00:22:12,559 --> 00:22:13,622
I knew it was you.

250
00:22:21,279 --> 00:22:22,342
How did you know?

251
00:22:25,160 --> 00:22:28,845
Only a few people in Chang'an can eavesdrop on my conversation.

252
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:35,526
What are you doing here?

253
00:22:39,119 --> 00:22:40,943
Are you trying to dig into my business

254
00:22:41,023 --> 00:22:43,085
because there's nothing to do at the Arcane Appraisal Bureau?

255
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,805
Are you here to add my daily routine to the records?

256
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:53,845
How's your health?

257
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:02,486
It's already over between us.

258
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,645
You no longer need to worry about me.

259
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:11,206
Does it really have to end?

260
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:19,206
Mr. Mei, have you made up your mind?

261
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:22,605
Are you sure you want to spend the rest of your life with your enemy?

262
00:23:27,519 --> 00:23:28,582
Mei Zhu Yu.

263
00:23:32,319 --> 00:23:34,206
You witnessed it yourself just now.

264
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,565
Your father's murderer

265
00:23:40,407 --> 00:23:42,374
is living inside my body.

266
00:24:12,828 --> 00:24:14,147
- Wu Zhen.   - Boss.

267
00:24:14,279 --> 00:24:15,342
Let's go.

268
00:24:16,519 --> 00:24:17,582
Wu Zhen.

269
00:24:18,119 --> 00:24:20,645
Commissioner Mei, are you trying to tease a girl in public?

270
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:22,023
That's right.

271
00:24:27,599 --> 00:24:28,662
Have you lost your mind?

272
00:24:30,000 --> 00:24:31,063
Show me your arm.

273
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,496
(Yuzhen Parlour)

274
00:25:01,824 --> 00:25:03,269
There are plenty of tasks to complete in the Demon City.

275
00:25:03,462 --> 00:25:04,701
Look at the state I'm in.

276
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:06,365
You still have time to worry about this?

277
00:25:06,680 --> 00:25:09,246
My lady, I'm not doing it for my own sake.

278
00:25:09,680 --> 00:25:11,085
I'm doing it for the sake of Yuzhen Parlour.

279
00:25:11,220 --> 00:25:13,821
It wasn't easy for us to get the chance to host this literary gathering.

280
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:15,446
How could we let someone else take the opportunity?

281
00:25:17,224 --> 00:25:20,187
You should stop spending time with Hu Zhu.

282
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:22,085
She has led you astray.

283
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:28,805
My lady, right now, you are Fourth Master Si.

284
00:25:29,359 --> 00:25:32,125
I'm afraid it's inappropriate for you to be here.

285
00:25:42,559 --> 00:25:43,622
You.

286
00:25:45,240 --> 00:25:46,303
Come here.

287
00:25:58,359 --> 00:25:59,486
Official Hu, great job.

288
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:01,463
Waiter, come.

289
00:26:03,771 --> 00:26:04,799
Go and get this framed.

290
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:05,943
All right.

291
00:26:06,359 --> 00:26:08,125
Here's a fine calligraphic work from Official Hu!

292
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:11,519
Official Hu, why don't you draw another one?

293
00:26:11,599 --> 00:26:12,662
We look forward to your work.

294
00:26:14,359 --> 00:26:16,726
Fourth Master Si, you actually wandered in brazenly, huh?

295
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:19,579
What about the sign that states that you are forbidden from entering?

296
00:26:19,661 --> 00:26:20,706
Has it been removed?

297
00:26:20,799 --> 00:26:22,405
The sign is over there.

298
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:24,560
- Yeah, that's right.   - It's over there.

299
00:26:24,640 --> 00:26:26,320
- Am I right?   - You see.

300
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,805
I remember that our last gathering was held at this venue as well.

301
00:26:29,319 --> 00:26:32,246
Fourth Master Si scaled the wall just to come inside.

302
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:34,766
He was treated much worse back then.

303
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,597
How is it?

304
00:26:36,680 --> 00:26:40,405
Since you're already here, you might as well show us your skills.

305
00:26:40,640 --> 00:26:42,239
- Yeah.   - Draw something for us.

306
00:26:42,319 --> 00:26:43,560
Draw something for us.

307
00:26:43,640 --> 00:26:44,805
Yeah, draw something for us.

308
00:26:45,079 --> 00:26:46,142
No need for that.

309
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,743
Don't go.

310
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:54,605
Everyone here knows that Mei Si is an expert artist.

311
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,766
He excels at drawing portraits of beautiful women.

312
00:26:57,240 --> 00:27:00,565
It's a shame that he only draws the portrait of one lady.

313
00:27:04,319 --> 00:27:07,006
You mean Lady Liu? Is she the one he can draw?

314
00:27:07,759 --> 00:27:08,822
Please go on stage.

315
00:27:09,254 --> 00:27:11,540
Sorry about that. I'll buy you some tea later.

316
00:27:11,759 --> 00:27:13,206
I'll buy all of you tea later.

317
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,085
- Sure.   - Sure.

318
00:27:17,000 --> 00:27:18,279
- Don't go.   - Why are you leaving?

319
00:27:18,359 --> 00:27:19,422
Don't go.

320
00:27:25,839 --> 00:27:27,125
What's wrong with all those people?

321
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,526
My lady, Yuzhen Parlour is related to you.

322
00:27:30,279 --> 00:27:32,046
And, Fourth Master Si has pestered you for many years.

323
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,645
Those literati hate such behaviors the most.

324
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,565
They said he was the disgrace of all nobility.

325
00:27:38,033 --> 00:27:41,639
Therefore, they would insult him whenever they saw him.

326
00:27:43,848 --> 00:27:45,328
Does Fourth Master Si know about this?

327
00:27:45,480 --> 00:27:47,486
He does. It's a common occurrence.

328
00:27:48,400 --> 00:27:49,885
Whenever people insult him,

329
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,885
Fourth Master Si would let it pass with a smile.

330
00:27:53,131 --> 00:27:54,165
Except for that time.

331
00:27:54,359 --> 00:27:57,640
Mr. Wu said that you were stringing him along on purpose.

332
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:58,783
It was a terrible comment.

333
00:27:59,680 --> 00:28:01,686
After that, Fourth Master Si stormed the Wu Residence.

334
00:28:01,974 --> 00:28:04,701
Rumor has it that they even fought each other.

335
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:09,046
I see.

336
00:28:16,559 --> 00:28:18,405
I had no idea about such occurrences at all.

337
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:22,565
Perhaps Fourth Master Si has always taken things lightly.

338
00:28:39,039 --> 00:28:42,400
I assume a gentleman is in love with Lady Liu

339
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:45,405
and is trying to express his feelings with this portrait.

340
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:46,902
Lady Liu.

341
00:28:48,279 --> 00:28:50,085
Lady Liu!

342
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,165
Lady Liu, what a coincidence.

343
00:28:53,480 --> 00:28:54,543
It's late now.

344
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:57,206
Have you just returned? Or were you just about to head out?

345
00:28:58,039 --> 00:28:59,766
You've been waiting here for the entire night.

346
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,605
Tonight is the night of the new moon.

347
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:03,966
It's the night when evil aura gathers the most.

348
00:29:04,559 --> 00:29:06,766
I waited here to keep guard over you as I was worried about your safety.

349
00:29:07,119 --> 00:29:08,206
Lady Liu, watch out!

350
00:29:13,880 --> 00:29:15,446
Don't harm Lady Liu!

351
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:27,382
Lady Liu.

352
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,486
You're quite bold, aren't you?

353
00:29:29,960 --> 00:29:31,845
I thought you would run away

354
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:33,766
after seeing my demon form.

355
00:29:34,079 --> 00:29:35,365
We are betrothed after all.

356
00:29:35,960 --> 00:29:38,325
Husbands and wives should be honest with each other.

357
00:29:40,072 --> 00:29:43,677
I only know that humans who do evil are more terrifying than demons.

358
00:29:44,409 --> 00:29:47,136
Miss, my fiancee is still waiting for me.

359
00:29:47,368 --> 00:29:48,431
Farewell.

360
00:29:48,983 --> 00:29:50,549
Do you wish to marry a demon?

361
00:29:51,599 --> 00:29:52,662
I wish to marry you.

362
00:29:53,043 --> 00:29:54,751
Lady Liu, you're a demon.

363
00:29:56,079 --> 00:29:59,766
If that's the case, no other woman can compare to you.

364
00:30:00,359 --> 00:30:02,405
They don't have a serpent body as beautiful as yours.

365
00:30:04,119 --> 00:30:05,182
Beautiful?

366
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:08,885
It's more beautiful than the one in the Compendium of Demons.

367
00:30:09,119 --> 00:30:10,845
It's the most beautiful serpent body I've ever seen.

368
00:30:14,839 --> 00:30:18,165
Xuan Hui is a greater demon of the Ying Dragon Clan.

369
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,365
How did you manage to bribe him?

370
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:24,605
I suppose I'm favored by snakes and serpents.

371
00:30:25,480 --> 00:30:27,125
Humans and demons have different lifespans.

372
00:30:27,559 --> 00:30:28,845
They're destined to be apart.

373
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:31,926
You'll only live for a few decades.

374
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:34,805
Why are you wasting your time on me?

375
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:38,405
I'll fancy you as long as I'm alive.

376
00:30:39,339 --> 00:30:43,544
I'll pray for your wellbeing as long as I fancy you.

377
00:30:44,184 --> 00:30:46,990
I may be dead after 100 years.

378
00:30:47,680 --> 00:30:50,246
But naturally, other people will pray for your wellbeing after that.

379
00:30:51,319 --> 00:30:52,605
Dear, you don't need to worry.

380
00:30:53,720 --> 00:30:54,783
Is it worth it?

381
00:30:55,319 --> 00:30:58,405
I decide whether or not it's worth it.

382
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,037
Lady Liu, what's wrong?

383
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,263
What happened?

384
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,046
Did you fight with Mr. Wu before?

385
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:20,463
I did.

386
00:31:21,720 --> 00:31:23,845
What's wrong? Did he cause trouble for you?

387
00:31:25,799 --> 00:31:28,885
Did you hit him just because he insulted me?

388
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:31,565
That's not it.

389
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:33,845
I wanted to beat him up a long time ago.

390
00:31:34,319 --> 00:31:36,726
But he practiced martial arts since young.

391
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:40,766
Therefore, I didn't manage to win against him.

392
00:31:41,400 --> 00:31:42,463
But why?

393
00:31:43,960 --> 00:31:45,446
I just couldn't defeat him.

394
00:31:46,480 --> 00:31:47,845
That's all there is to it.

395
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,747
You wanted to fight him even though you knew you didn't stand a chance.

396
00:31:51,828 --> 00:31:52,891
Are you an idiot?

397
00:31:53,160 --> 00:31:55,165
I can't just let him insult you like that!

398
00:31:56,960 --> 00:31:58,023
Fourth Master Si.

399
00:32:03,480 --> 00:32:04,543
I'm sorry.

400
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:09,943
What did you say?

401
00:32:17,599 --> 00:32:18,805
I want to say sorry

402
00:32:20,640 --> 00:32:21,703
for everything that had happened.

403
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:50,342
I got my body back.

404
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:53,605
Lady Liu, we got our bodies back!

405
00:32:54,039 --> 00:32:55,102
Let me see.

406
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:01,382
He said

407
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:04,766
one could exchange one's body with one's beloved with the figurine.

408
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,645
One can get their body back when the other party falls in love with them.

409
00:33:10,680 --> 00:33:12,365
Lady Liu, we got our bodies back!

410
00:33:15,240 --> 00:33:16,303
I'll make a move first.

411
00:33:24,160 --> 00:33:25,246
Six, seven...

412
00:33:35,400 --> 00:33:36,966
Today's indeed a good day.

413
00:33:37,519 --> 00:33:39,583
Not only has Her Ladyship's issue been resolved,

414
00:33:39,663 --> 00:33:41,526
but we also make a huge profit.

415
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:45,645
This is excellent indeed.

416
00:34:18,880 --> 00:34:19,943
Who's there?

417
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:22,262
Are you a thief?

418
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:24,463
I know martial arts, you know?

419
00:34:59,766 --> 00:35:00,779
This is truly unexpected.

420
00:35:00,859 --> 00:35:03,011
I thought you two would never get your bodies back.

421
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:07,360
Serpent Lord, how did you end up falling for someone after 200 years?

422
00:35:07,440 --> 00:35:08,806
Can you stop bringing that up?

423
00:35:09,774 --> 00:35:10,819
Serpent Lord?

424
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,085
You're back.

425
00:35:14,639 --> 00:35:18,205
Look at how popular you've become in just two days.

426
00:35:18,599 --> 00:35:20,526
What has Mei Si done using my body?

427
00:35:22,280 --> 00:35:24,645
Serpent Lord, these are the new spices that have just arrived.

428
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:26,102
Please have one.

429
00:35:30,280 --> 00:35:31,320
Thank you.

430
00:35:31,400 --> 00:35:33,326
You're too courteous.

431
00:35:33,519 --> 00:35:34,582
Just get used to it.

432
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:37,846
My ladies, we're in trouble.

433
00:35:38,039 --> 00:35:39,846
Someone delivered this to the Demon City's entrance.

434
00:35:47,105 --> 00:35:50,661
(Demon Lord, I will be waiting at Yuzhen Parlour tonight)

435
00:35:51,610 --> 00:35:53,136
Changxi Palace just left our city.

436
00:35:53,904 --> 00:35:55,629
And now, someone else is trying to cause trouble.

437
00:35:56,615 --> 00:35:59,942
I'll find out the mastermind behind this.

438
00:36:10,793 --> 00:36:11,839
My ladies!

439
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:14,007
Zhu Ying! Hurry and save me!

440
00:36:14,360 --> 00:36:15,423
Save me!

441
00:36:16,559 --> 00:36:17,622
Hurry and save me!

442
00:36:20,280 --> 00:36:21,343
There's fire underneath me!

443
00:36:23,183 --> 00:36:26,069
Who exactly are you? Why are you hiding yourself?

444
00:36:36,239 --> 00:36:37,302
It's you?

445
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:40,926
What's wrong with the members of Changxi Palace?

446
00:36:41,326 --> 00:36:42,652
Is this the only tactic you have?

447
00:36:43,203 --> 00:36:44,640
It doesn't matter as long as it's effective.

448
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:47,846
Tell me. What are you up to?

449
00:36:48,679 --> 00:36:49,742
I'm not up to anything.

450
00:36:50,127 --> 00:36:51,374
I can release him.

451
00:36:52,864 --> 00:36:53,883
As long as...

452
00:36:53,964 --> 00:36:55,089
What do you want?

453
00:37:02,679 --> 00:37:03,926
Have a meal with me,

454
00:37:04,440 --> 00:37:05,503
Dear.

455
00:37:08,320 --> 00:37:11,165
What can you do if I say no?

456
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:20,343
Fine!

457
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:23,943
Fine.

458
00:37:30,920 --> 00:37:34,886
Commissioner Mei, your behavior is getting more and more questionable.

459
00:37:35,639 --> 00:37:38,565
Dear, aren't you going to come up here?

460
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:47,503
My lady!

461
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:48,903
Zhu Ying!

462
00:37:49,320 --> 00:37:50,725
Don't just leave me alone!

463
00:37:51,239 --> 00:37:53,125
My lady! Zhu Ying!

464
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,846
Don't leave me alone!

465
00:38:00,015 --> 00:38:03,744
(Yuzhen Parlour)

466
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,446
My lady, is Ling Xiao truly fine?

467
00:38:07,579 --> 00:38:08,746
He's not the one in trouble here.

468
00:38:09,679 --> 00:38:13,725
Why is it that we're always ensnared by love?

469
00:38:31,127 --> 00:38:33,533
All of these are your favorite dishes. Try them.

470
00:38:34,881 --> 00:38:35,944
What's the point of this?

471
00:38:37,936 --> 00:38:40,141
Mr. Mei, if you truly wanted to have a meal with me,

472
00:38:41,238 --> 00:38:44,443
you should've returned home on your birthday.

473
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:48,503
My birthday, huh?

474
00:38:52,239 --> 00:38:54,725
It's the same if we celebrate it now.

475
00:38:56,159 --> 00:38:58,085
Mr. Mei, you went through a lot of trouble for this.

476
00:39:00,079 --> 00:39:01,245
What's your motive?

477
00:39:03,519 --> 00:39:04,582
There's no motive.

478
00:39:06,039 --> 00:39:08,112
I just think that you're still hiding something from me.

479
00:39:08,192 --> 00:39:10,486
I merely wish to seek the truth.

480
00:39:13,639 --> 00:39:15,565
Is this how you make a request?

481
00:39:19,199 --> 00:39:20,366
That's not important.

482
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,983
Dear, please take a bite. We can enjoy our chat leisurely.

483
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:37,486
Cat Lord, please take a bite!

484
00:39:47,000 --> 00:39:49,366
Ever since I knew that there was something off about my parents' death,

485
00:39:51,199 --> 00:39:53,085
I'd been searching for the truth all this while.

486
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:55,823
I have no other burdens

487
00:39:58,840 --> 00:39:59,926
other than that.

488
00:40:03,519 --> 00:40:04,582
Wu Zhen.

489
00:40:06,960 --> 00:40:11,262
You were the one who got me involved with this worldly realm.

490
00:40:14,639 --> 00:40:16,565
You can't just abandon me like this.

491
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,725
Mr. Mei, I'm afraid you've read too many storybooks.

492
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:35,446
People rarely part ways with one another

493
00:40:36,800 --> 00:40:39,125
with reluctance.

494
00:40:40,199 --> 00:40:43,526
If that's the case, why were you avoiding me?

495
00:40:48,159 --> 00:40:49,966
What exactly were you hiding from me?
