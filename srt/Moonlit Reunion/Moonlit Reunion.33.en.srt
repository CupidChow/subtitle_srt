00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,952
(Moonlit Reunion)

2
00:01:31,034 --> 00:01:33,960
(Episode 33)

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:45,193
Watch out!

4
00:02:06,031 --> 00:02:08,040
Luckily, my fair face wasn't damaged.

5
00:02:13,639 --> 00:02:15,160
Sorry about this.

6
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,626
Just now, you two placed me too close to the fire.

7
00:02:18,931 --> 00:02:20,295
The sparks were jumping onto my body.

8
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:22,665
I couldn't hold it in.

9
00:02:24,599 --> 00:02:28,665
I was wondering why something was off about it.

10
00:02:28,982 --> 00:02:31,528
- It turns out to be... - A broom spirit.

11
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:33,546
That's rather inauspicious.

12
00:02:34,479 --> 00:02:36,593
Celestial Master, please spare me!

13
00:02:36,719 --> 00:02:38,825
I didn't mean to alarm you two!

14
00:02:39,243 --> 00:02:41,644
I'm just a lowly broom spirit!

15
00:02:41,729 --> 00:02:43,474
Please don't subdue me!

16
00:02:44,206 --> 00:02:46,832
I won't, since you haven't committed any evil deeds.

17
00:02:47,033 --> 00:02:48,106
You should get up.

18
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:49,505
Yeah.

19
00:02:52,464 --> 00:02:55,290
Do you reside here permanently?

20
00:02:56,472 --> 00:02:57,779
Indeed.

21
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:00,186
I wish to inquire about something from you.

22
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:02,963
Please tell me.

23
00:03:03,044 --> 00:03:06,189
Have you ever heard of the Zhuyu Divine Herb?

24
00:03:06,976 --> 00:03:08,049
Zhu!

25
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:09,946
Zhu...

26
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,466
Zhu...

27
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:14,265
Enough. I understand.

28
00:03:20,201 --> 00:03:23,027
I'll leave right now. I'll give you guys some space.

29
00:03:23,232 --> 00:03:24,305
I'll leave right now.

30
00:03:31,295 --> 00:03:33,720
What was that herb you mentioned? What's its function?

31
00:03:35,063 --> 00:03:38,626
It's a type of herb. It's used for treating illness.

32
00:03:39,208 --> 00:03:40,674
Treating illness, huh?

33
00:03:41,257 --> 00:03:42,330
Are you ill?

34
00:04:07,719 --> 00:04:08,792
Come.

35
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:18,433
Come.

36
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:25,633
Come.

37
00:04:26,058 --> 00:04:27,131
Slowly.

38
00:04:29,645 --> 00:04:31,245
Old madam, are you okay?

39
00:04:31,392 --> 00:04:34,072
I'm fine. I slipped just now.

40
00:04:34,168 --> 00:04:35,714
I just feel a little giddy.

41
00:04:36,193 --> 00:04:37,859
Miss, thank you for your concern.

42
00:04:38,119 --> 00:04:40,826
Old madam, do you intend to gather herbs in the mountain?

43
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:45,025
That's right. My family has lived in this mountain for generations.

44
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,706
We gather herbs for a living.

45
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:49,514
If so, have you ever heard about the Zhuyu Divine Herb?

46
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:51,569
Zhuyu Divine Herb?

47
00:04:52,793 --> 00:04:55,339
I think I've heard of it somewhere.

48
00:04:55,617 --> 00:04:57,563
Do you know where it's located?

49
00:04:57,944 --> 00:04:59,017
Indeed.

50
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:02,222
There's a famous physician named Gu on this mountain.

51
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:06,222
Her herb garden contains all kinds of divine herbs.

52
00:05:06,336 --> 00:05:09,522
You guys might find what you seek there.

53
00:05:10,401 --> 00:05:12,081
Dear, let's go and take a look.

54
00:05:12,187 --> 00:05:13,746
- All right. - Thank you, old madam.

55
00:05:13,813 --> 00:05:14,815
Thank you.

56
00:05:14,879 --> 00:05:15,952
Let's go.

57
00:05:20,737 --> 00:05:23,495
Wait. Why don't we take the old madam with us?

58
00:05:36,628 --> 00:05:39,472
You two must be here to seek the herb. Please follow me.

59
00:06:24,551 --> 00:06:28,382
Looks like plenty of folk have come here due to her reputation.

60
00:06:29,025 --> 00:06:31,531
Physician Gu is an amazing physician.

61
00:06:31,945 --> 00:06:35,211
I heard that she's even a demi-deity now.

62
00:06:35,729 --> 00:06:40,591
I assume our mortal troubles pose no trouble for her.

63
00:06:41,276 --> 00:06:43,063
I don't know if she's a demi-deity or not.

64
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:46,018
But I heard that she's in possession of a divine item.

65
00:06:46,359 --> 00:06:48,265
It's called the Zhuyu Divine Herb.

66
00:06:49,993 --> 00:06:52,418
Are you all here for the Zhuyu Divine Herb as well?

67
00:06:53,413 --> 00:06:56,760
Everyone only came here to seek the same herb.

68
00:07:01,473 --> 00:07:04,539
Everyone, it must've been a long trip.

69
00:07:06,775 --> 00:07:08,641
My mistress is inside the room.

70
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,338
My wife and I came without an invitation.

71
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,162
Please pardon us for the intrusion.

72
00:07:12,243 --> 00:07:13,316
It doesn't matter.

73
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,843
Those who are sincere will get their wish granted.

74
00:07:18,063 --> 00:07:19,769
She sounds just like the old madam.

75
00:07:20,359 --> 00:07:21,519
We must practice caution.

76
00:07:21,703 --> 00:07:23,303
Since you all are here to seek the herb,

77
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:26,546
I'm sure you know that there's a price for everything.

78
00:07:26,655 --> 00:07:29,095
Every illness comes with its own degree of severity and urgency.

79
00:07:29,119 --> 00:07:31,305
I shall converse with you all in turn.

80
00:07:31,416 --> 00:07:35,986
Please rest outside before your turn.

81
00:07:47,311 --> 00:07:49,577
Mister, you have a magnificent air.

82
00:07:49,704 --> 00:07:51,650
I assume you don't lack anything.

83
00:07:51,722 --> 00:07:53,282
May I know why you're seeking the herb?

84
00:07:53,432 --> 00:07:54,505
Me?

85
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:56,987
My family runs a fabric store.

86
00:07:57,087 --> 00:07:59,074
I've led a luxurious life since young.

87
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:01,018
I lack nothing indeed.

88
00:08:01,423 --> 00:08:03,970
But now, I'm a middle-aged man.

89
00:08:04,311 --> 00:08:05,857
Although I have several spouses,

90
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:09,560
I only have daughters. I don't have a son.

91
00:08:09,873 --> 00:08:12,378
There's no one to inherit the family business.

92
00:08:13,799 --> 00:08:14,872
So,

93
00:08:15,177 --> 00:08:18,602
are you seeking the herb so that you can have a son?

94
00:08:18,696 --> 00:08:23,186
I will obtain the herb no matter how much I have to pay for it.

95
00:08:33,559 --> 00:08:36,146
Mister, my mistress is calling for you.

96
00:08:38,852 --> 00:08:41,119
Why can he meet her first?

97
00:08:41,480 --> 00:08:42,524
Precisely.

98
00:08:42,605 --> 00:08:45,359
We've been waiting for some time as well, you know?

99
00:08:45,734 --> 00:08:47,693
Dear guests, please calm down.

100
00:08:47,778 --> 00:08:50,405
My mistress practices fair treatment.

101
00:08:50,864 --> 00:08:53,729
As for your situation and your treatment plan,

102
00:08:54,329 --> 00:08:56,954
it has nothing to do with the order of meeting.

103
00:08:57,352 --> 00:08:58,777
Mister, please.

104
00:09:10,016 --> 00:09:12,362
This world is unfair!

105
00:09:13,480 --> 00:09:18,546
Some people are born with a silver spoon.

106
00:09:18,642 --> 00:09:20,129
And, they're even doing all they can

107
00:09:20,209 --> 00:09:22,669
to share the prosperity with their descendants.

108
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:30,144
But some? They have to go through poverty and suffering.

109
00:09:30,264 --> 00:09:31,450
Poverty and suffering, huh?

110
00:09:32,823 --> 00:09:37,290
Old mister, you have a rosy complexion. You look healthy as well.

111
00:09:38,912 --> 00:09:40,913
It doesn't look like you're ill.

112
00:09:41,144 --> 00:09:44,970
All of my predecessors were officials.

113
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:52,480
But me? I failed the imperial exam time and time again.

114
00:09:53,177 --> 00:09:56,962
I only managed to become a jinshi scholar in middle age.

115
00:09:57,233 --> 00:09:59,659
I had barely enjoyed my privilege,

116
00:10:00,191 --> 00:10:03,298
yet I've already become an old man.

117
00:10:05,022 --> 00:10:07,288
How could I be satisfied?

118
00:10:08,312 --> 00:10:13,138
I must live longer

119
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,825
and enjoy my fame and fortune, which was hard to come by.

120
00:10:22,896 --> 00:10:24,682
But there's a limit to our lifespan.

121
00:10:25,042 --> 00:10:28,228
Even if you're greedy about it, your life will still end eventually.

122
00:10:29,004 --> 00:10:32,029
Unless you wish to seek immortality.

123
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:35,343
Of course. I have all the right to seek immortality.

124
00:10:36,472 --> 00:10:39,538
That's my only wish.

125
00:10:39,791 --> 00:10:42,538
I have to fulfill my wish

126
00:10:44,015 --> 00:10:46,002
no matter the price I have to pay.

127
00:10:48,232 --> 00:10:51,739
That's right. This world is indeed unfair.

128
00:10:52,896 --> 00:10:54,681
I was born beautiful.

129
00:10:55,201 --> 00:10:58,507
My reputation as a beauty traveled far and wide after I became an adult.

130
00:10:59,409 --> 00:11:03,196
But this year, a new bride of unknown origin showed up in the next village.

131
00:11:04,128 --> 00:11:07,074
They actually said that she was more beautiful than me.

132
00:11:09,776 --> 00:11:14,622
She overtook my position as the village's top beauty just like that.

133
00:11:15,840 --> 00:11:17,585
How could I be satisfied?

134
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:22,046
I'm willing to sacrifice my life if it means I can reclaim my position.

135
00:11:44,621 --> 00:11:45,967
I'm going to have a son.

136
00:11:46,159 --> 00:11:47,625
I'm going to have a son!

137
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:51,186
Thank you, Divine Healer Gu!

138
00:11:52,559 --> 00:11:54,625
I... I'm going to have a son!

139
00:12:00,759 --> 00:12:03,026
Old mister, you're up next.

140
00:12:11,023 --> 00:12:13,263
I suppose giving birth to a son isn't that far-fetched.

141
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,465
But regarding that old mister's wish,

142
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,386
how could someone attain immortality?

143
00:12:20,324 --> 00:12:22,550
We'll know once he leaves the room.

144
00:12:30,985 --> 00:12:32,058
Thank you.

145
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:35,465
Though it may not last for all eternity,

146
00:12:35,865 --> 00:12:37,520
my position

147
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:42,080
can at least endure for a century or two.

148
00:12:46,615 --> 00:12:48,035
That's more than enough.

149
00:12:50,911 --> 00:12:53,138
A century or two!

150
00:12:54,784 --> 00:12:56,010
That's more than enough.

151
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:57,625
That's more than enough.

152
00:12:59,905 --> 00:13:03,172
Dear, what do you think about their conversation?

153
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,946
Why does it feel like something's off?

154
00:13:08,208 --> 00:13:11,567
What about me? The sun will set soon. Am I next?

155
00:13:11,719 --> 00:13:13,929
Miss, don't be impatient. You're up next.

156
00:13:14,063 --> 00:13:15,136
Let's go.

157
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,058
It seems you two aren't in a hurry.

158
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:30,053
All things follow their own law. There's a sequence to all things.

159
00:13:31,015 --> 00:13:32,088
There's no point rushing.

160
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,273
Watch your steps.

161
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,105
- I'm the most beautiful girl now. - Be careful.

162
00:13:50,256 --> 00:13:52,096
That's right. I'm the most beautiful girl now.

163
00:13:52,165 --> 00:13:53,238
Be careful.

164
00:13:53,667 --> 00:13:54,827
- Are you okay? - I'm fine.

165
00:13:55,039 --> 00:13:56,439
I'm the most beautiful of them all.

166
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:59,240
- I'm the most beautiful of them all now. - Watch your steps.

167
00:14:01,550 --> 00:14:02,623
Take care.

168
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,102
Although you two came here together,

169
00:14:09,126 --> 00:14:10,798
my mistress will only receive the patient.

170
00:14:10,822 --> 00:14:12,768
Which of you is seeking her treatment?

171
00:14:16,144 --> 00:14:17,217
It's her.

172
00:14:19,583 --> 00:14:20,656
Me?

173
00:14:24,448 --> 00:14:26,475
Go now. I'll wait for your return.

174
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,793
Please follow me.

175
00:14:43,857 --> 00:14:45,803
Mister, are you not afraid?

176
00:14:50,032 --> 00:14:51,105
Afraid of what?

177
00:14:52,351 --> 00:14:55,457
I heard that Physician Gu always demands a price for her treatment.

178
00:14:55,775 --> 00:14:59,266
Aren't you afraid that your spouse might make a deal behind your back?

179
00:14:59,471 --> 00:15:00,544
Not at all.

180
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:01,913
Why is that?

181
00:15:03,195 --> 00:15:05,661
It's because you're the threat in this clinic.

182
00:15:26,615 --> 00:15:27,688
Physician Gu.

183
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,947
Young lady, what do you seek?

184
00:15:32,307 --> 00:15:33,532
I have no idea either.

185
00:15:33,889 --> 00:15:36,435
I only found out that I was ill not long ago.

186
00:15:36,937 --> 00:15:38,963
That's why I came here to seek you out.

187
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:42,225
You don't even know the kind of illness you have.

188
00:15:42,484 --> 00:15:45,991
And, you desire nothing. Why would you come to a place like this?

189
00:15:48,695 --> 00:15:49,768
Forget it.

190
00:15:50,441 --> 00:15:52,107
Let me give you a diagnosis.

191
00:16:08,039 --> 00:16:11,906
Young lady, there's something peculiar about your illness.

192
00:16:12,048 --> 00:16:13,234
Peculiar?

193
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:15,426
Don't tell me you cannot identify it.

194
00:16:17,312 --> 00:16:19,939
Perhaps it's because we don't have an affinity with each other.

195
00:16:22,691 --> 00:16:24,157
If that was truly the case,

196
00:16:24,359 --> 00:16:27,984
you didn't need to transform yourself into an old lady

197
00:16:28,160 --> 00:16:29,586
and lure us all the way here.

198
00:16:30,532 --> 00:16:36,319
Young lady, probing into other people's affairs is a bad habit.

199
00:16:36,935 --> 00:16:39,001
I suppose I have a detestable personality.

200
00:16:39,304 --> 00:16:41,610
Today, I must get to the bottom of this.

201
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:51,272
What's going on?

202
00:16:59,039 --> 00:17:01,266
What do you mean by that?

203
00:17:02,773 --> 00:17:06,278
The figure inside is just a puppet. It doesn't pose any threat.

204
00:17:07,081 --> 00:17:09,826
You're the mastermind behind everything.

205
00:17:12,574 --> 00:17:14,120
Since when did you find out?

206
00:17:15,471 --> 00:17:17,017
Right after I arrived.

207
00:17:28,743 --> 00:17:31,089
Old mister, my mistress is calling for you.

208
00:17:35,015 --> 00:17:37,601
You deceive the masses using the notion of a divine herb.

209
00:17:37,880 --> 00:17:39,585
What's in it for you?

210
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:43,145
You're wrong. I never intended to deceive you all on purpose.

211
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,530
You guys were the ones with selfish requests.

212
00:17:45,607 --> 00:17:48,248
You guys wouldn't be led here that easily

213
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:50,680
had you not intended to seek out the Zhuyu Divine Herb.

214
00:17:52,990 --> 00:17:55,937
Are you saying that the Zhuyu Divine Herb does exist?

215
00:17:57,687 --> 00:17:58,760
Indeed.

216
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:46,569
The Zhuyu Divine Herb isn't a hoax.

217
00:18:47,211 --> 00:18:49,958
However, just like what I've said, everything has a price.

218
00:18:50,376 --> 00:18:52,416
If people want their greedy desires to be fulfilled,

219
00:18:52,440 --> 00:18:54,946
they have to pay with something even more precious to them.

220
00:18:55,719 --> 00:18:57,199
Something even more precious to them?

221
00:18:58,039 --> 00:19:00,266
Do you remember the middle-aged man who desired a son?

222
00:19:01,225 --> 00:19:02,491
I'm going to have a son.

223
00:19:02,751 --> 00:19:04,111
I'm going to have a son!

224
00:19:04,279 --> 00:19:06,946
Indeed. He'll have a son soon.

225
00:19:07,240 --> 00:19:10,905
However, his family will fall on the day the child is born.

226
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:13,305
And that old man.

227
00:19:13,529 --> 00:19:15,636
So what if he has a long life now?

228
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:18,026
That's more than enough.

229
00:19:21,537 --> 00:19:24,083
He'll be riddled with illness. It'd be better for him to die.

230
00:19:25,165 --> 00:19:27,485
As for the young lady who wanted to change her appearance,

231
00:19:27,792 --> 00:19:29,458
I took her eyes from her.

232
00:19:29,872 --> 00:19:31,912
Even if she's the most beautiful girl in the world,

233
00:19:32,079 --> 00:19:33,865
she cannot see it for herself.

234
00:19:35,544 --> 00:19:36,617
You lunatic.

235
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:37,953
Lunatic?

236
00:19:38,519 --> 00:19:40,639
I'm a lunatic, huh? What about the rest of the world?

237
00:19:40,848 --> 00:19:43,993
They go to extreme lengths unknowingly just to achieve their goal.

238
00:19:44,569 --> 00:19:50,306
Everyone here will fulfill their wishes at all costs.

239
00:19:51,055 --> 00:19:52,128
What about you two?

240
00:19:54,079 --> 00:19:57,026
What kind of price are you two willing to pay

241
00:19:57,920 --> 00:20:00,145
if I agree to provide treatment to your wife?

242
00:20:02,244 --> 00:20:03,911
Touch her if you dare.

243
00:20:04,160 --> 00:20:08,625
Don't worry. I'm uninterested in wounding or killing people.

244
00:20:09,519 --> 00:20:12,266
But it's rare to encounter an intelligent individual like you.

245
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,865
Why don't we play a game?

246
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:17,553
Sure.

247
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:18,872
What kind of game?

248
00:20:21,471 --> 00:20:24,337
I look after all the plants in the courtyard.

249
00:20:24,495 --> 00:20:26,041
You have but a tea's time.

250
00:20:26,759 --> 00:20:29,145
I'll provide you two with a free treatment

251
00:20:29,359 --> 00:20:32,120
if you can find the most valuable plant out there. What do you think?

252
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:33,953
Deal.

253
00:21:48,058 --> 00:21:50,403
Mister, you must be a fool.

254
00:21:50,649 --> 00:21:53,555
This is nothing more than the most common pine moss.

255
00:21:54,127 --> 00:21:55,200
No.

256
00:21:55,752 --> 00:21:59,257
This is the most valuable plant here.

257
00:22:00,801 --> 00:22:02,147
What do you mean by that?

258
00:22:02,656 --> 00:22:06,482
Because everything is fake except for it.

259
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:45,746
Are you a Celestial Master?

260
00:22:45,983 --> 00:22:47,410
That's right, demon.

261
00:22:52,392 --> 00:22:54,858
How many people have you deceived all these years?

262
00:22:55,387 --> 00:22:57,400
(Divine Herb Demon)

263
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,200
Subdue me if you can.

264
00:22:59,505 --> 00:23:02,025
But there's nothing in it for you.

265
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:03,313
It's because...

266
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:05,746
It's because he's no ordinary demon.

267
00:23:16,783 --> 00:23:17,856
Are you okay?

268
00:23:18,536 --> 00:23:19,842
I found this.

269
00:23:20,088 --> 00:23:21,161
What is that?

270
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:23,625
These are the medical case reports he wrote.

271
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,786
Am I right, Zhuyu Divine Herb?

272
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:29,907
They were no longer of use to me.

273
00:23:30,217 --> 00:23:31,642
Why did you take them with you?

274
00:23:33,368 --> 00:23:35,154
Judging from them,

275
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:36,848
you too once practiced medicine for the good of all

276
00:23:36,872 --> 00:23:38,312
and treated patients wholeheartedly.

277
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:41,615
But why have you ended up like this?

278
00:23:41,759 --> 00:23:43,279
Practice medicine for the good of all?

279
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:47,516
That's just plain wishful thinking.

280
00:23:48,463 --> 00:23:50,063
As for treating patients wholeheartedly,

281
00:23:50,238 --> 00:23:52,905
these people don't care about my wholeheartedness at all.

282
00:23:56,979 --> 00:24:00,245
Many years ago, when I was still a plant,

283
00:24:00,663 --> 00:24:02,143
someone nurtured and looked after me.

284
00:24:02,705 --> 00:24:04,730
My master looked after me every day.

285
00:24:05,576 --> 00:24:09,866
He hoped that I could gain sentience and treat patients one day.

286
00:24:12,671 --> 00:24:14,831
He said that all living beings are bound to suffering.

287
00:24:14,997 --> 00:24:16,299
As I am blessed with the chance to seek the root of all things

288
00:24:16,323 --> 00:24:17,703
and heal every illness,

289
00:24:18,369 --> 00:24:19,635
I shouldn't let it go to waste.

290
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:23,946
It's a shame that my level of cultivation wasn't enough.

291
00:24:24,241 --> 00:24:25,866
I couldn't obtain a human form.

292
00:24:26,839 --> 00:24:29,145
He said it was fine. He said he would wait for me.

293
00:24:31,152 --> 00:24:32,538
I trusted him.

294
00:24:34,766 --> 00:24:36,872
But when I obtained my human form,

295
00:24:37,617 --> 00:24:38,762
I realized

296
00:24:40,344 --> 00:24:42,049
that I was abandoned.

297
00:24:43,057 --> 00:24:44,682
The residence was empty.

298
00:24:46,119 --> 00:24:48,546
My master never came back for me.

299
00:24:56,160 --> 00:24:58,185
In my sorrow, I left Chang'an

300
00:24:58,792 --> 00:24:59,865
and traveled to Quzhou.

301
00:25:01,376 --> 00:25:03,976
Initially, I wanted to practice medicine and treat patients here.

302
00:25:05,005 --> 00:25:08,071
But gradually, I realized that they weren't worth saving.

303
00:25:08,329 --> 00:25:09,994
All living beings are bound to suffering?

304
00:25:10,336 --> 00:25:12,602
They merely deserve it!

305
00:25:13,543 --> 00:25:14,616
Indeed.

306
00:25:15,656 --> 00:25:16,922
Just like what you've seen,

307
00:25:17,851 --> 00:25:21,637
at first, I treated all of my patients wholeheartedly.

308
00:25:21,928 --> 00:25:23,113
But in the end?

309
00:25:28,533 --> 00:25:31,783
(Free Consultation)

310
00:25:31,864 --> 00:25:33,729
Free consultation?

311
00:25:34,089 --> 00:25:35,449
Is this even real?

312
00:25:35,577 --> 00:25:37,002
He's not a scammer, isn't he?

313
00:25:37,784 --> 00:25:39,304
As for his medical skills,

314
00:25:39,385 --> 00:25:40,848
I thought you received his treatment before.

315
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:42,185
I was just here because everyone was here.

316
00:25:42,209 --> 00:25:44,436
Since the consultation is free, we should go for it.

317
00:25:45,754 --> 00:25:48,540
He was the one who cured the sores on your tongue.

318
00:25:49,713 --> 00:25:50,783
Not necessarily.

319
00:25:50,921 --> 00:25:53,443
They'd heal by themselves even if I didn't take his medicine.

320
00:25:53,635 --> 00:25:54,718
Come, let's go and drink.

321
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:55,872
Let's drink.

322
00:25:56,139 --> 00:25:57,212
Let's go.

323
00:25:57,891 --> 00:26:01,078
I sought to save, not to make a profit.

324
00:26:01,479 --> 00:26:03,186
But they didn't trust me at all.

325
00:26:03,488 --> 00:26:05,834
I traveled far and wide, diagnosing one case after another.

326
00:26:05,858 --> 00:26:08,404
I thought I would gain their trust after their recovery.

327
00:26:08,647 --> 00:26:10,880
By then, people will spread word of me from mouth to mouth.

328
00:26:10,904 --> 00:26:13,130
This way, I could become a famous physician.

329
00:26:18,223 --> 00:26:20,063
But even if I had treated them wholeheartedly,

330
00:26:20,472 --> 00:26:22,139
they weren't content at all.

331
00:26:33,177 --> 00:26:34,866
My child was vomiting and had diarrhea last night

332
00:26:34,890 --> 00:26:36,199
after taking your medicine!

333
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:37,800
Did you give us bogus medicine?

334
00:26:37,880 --> 00:26:39,611
- Did you? - That's impossible.

335
00:26:39,735 --> 00:26:41,855
Did your child take something cold after that?

336
00:26:41,967 --> 00:26:43,088
And my father!

337
00:26:43,240 --> 00:26:45,425
You said he would recover at the start of the year!

338
00:26:45,506 --> 00:26:46,579
But yesterday...

339
00:26:47,192 --> 00:26:48,376
He passed away yesterday!

340
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,526
You're just a quack doctor!

341
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:51,786
- Compensate us! - Compensate us!

342
00:26:51,880 --> 00:26:54,719
That's not true. The old mister was already in his nineties.

343
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:56,306
There's a limit to one's lifespan.

344
00:26:57,481 --> 00:26:58,560
Return my father to me!

345
00:26:58,641 --> 00:27:00,015
- How dare you trick us? - You quack doctor!

346
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:02,706
- Quack doctor! - Quack doctor!

347
00:27:04,160 --> 00:27:05,233
Let's go!

348
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:11,209
All lives will come to an end one day.

349
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,145
Even healers cannot do anything about it.

350
00:27:15,969 --> 00:27:18,889
I did my best in treating patients without asking for anything in return.

351
00:27:19,079 --> 00:27:21,585
But in the end? They let me down.

352
00:27:22,359 --> 00:27:23,546
After that, I understood why.

353
00:27:23,977 --> 00:27:26,964
What they crave was nothing but the freedom to do as they please.

354
00:27:27,314 --> 00:27:31,219
Thus, I set up a trap and made them pay a high price for their desires.

355
00:27:32,236 --> 00:27:34,863
They knew about the consequences. However, they still went for it

356
00:27:35,239 --> 00:27:36,919
for the sake of their desires.

357
00:27:37,095 --> 00:27:38,601
They felt indebted to me instead.

358
00:27:39,576 --> 00:27:42,162
It was their fault for treating you like that.

359
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,426
But you shouldn't let them blind your vision.

360
00:27:44,959 --> 00:27:46,389
Do you dare to say that no one else

361
00:27:46,469 --> 00:27:48,706
sought your treatment earnestly after that?

362
00:27:48,961 --> 00:27:53,707
And, why must these innocent people suffer because of their predecessors?

363
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:55,145
Innocent people?

364
00:27:56,304 --> 00:27:58,650
They just haven't shown their true colors.

365
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:00,936
How is it wrong for me to launch a preemptive strike?

366
00:28:00,960 --> 00:28:02,585
Everyone possesses obsessions.

367
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:06,625
Some people can spend an entire lifetime going after their obsessions.

368
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:09,706
But that's not an excuse for you to harm humans.

369
00:28:11,519 --> 00:28:13,865
Young lady, you have a sharp tongue indeed.

370
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:17,306
It's a shame that you've exposed me.

371
00:28:17,960 --> 00:28:20,679
If not, I'll surely take your tongue as the price.

372
00:28:20,759 --> 00:28:21,832
Time to die!

373
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:39,672
Wu Zhen.

374
00:28:39,759 --> 00:28:40,832
Wu Zhen?

375
00:28:47,759 --> 00:28:49,306
That was the Cat Lord's power.

376
00:28:49,839 --> 00:28:50,912
Who is she?

377
00:28:51,359 --> 00:28:52,639
How did you know about Cat Lord?

378
00:28:54,863 --> 00:28:56,729
Cat Lord was the person who nurtured me.

379
00:29:00,616 --> 00:29:03,321
You were referring to the previous Cat Lord.

380
00:29:03,911 --> 00:29:04,984
Previous Cat Lord?

381
00:29:05,329 --> 00:29:06,675
Where is he right now?

382
00:29:07,281 --> 00:29:09,786
He passed away 18 years ago.

383
00:29:15,047 --> 00:29:16,194
He passed away?

384
00:29:22,711 --> 00:29:23,898
Is he dead?

385
00:29:27,391 --> 00:29:29,478
18 years ago, countless people were injured and killed

386
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:30,951
during the Divine Fire Chaos in Chang'an.

387
00:29:30,975 --> 00:29:33,601
The previous Cat Lord sacrificed himself to save the city.

388
00:29:38,445 --> 00:29:41,551
No wonder the residence was empty.

389
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:45,458
No wonder he didn't come and find me again.

390
00:29:47,257 --> 00:29:49,242
So, it wasn't that he abandoned me.

391
00:29:49,648 --> 00:29:51,394
He had already passed away back then.

392
00:29:52,648 --> 00:29:53,875
It's all my fault.

393
00:29:54,096 --> 00:29:55,202
Why is that your fault?

394
00:29:56,704 --> 00:29:58,250
It's because I wasn't powerful enough.

395
00:29:59,057 --> 00:30:00,857
It's because I couldn't do anything about it.

396
00:30:00,926 --> 00:30:03,992
I might've been able to save him had I acquired my human form sooner.

397
00:30:08,519 --> 00:30:09,592
It's all my fault.

398
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:13,455
The affairs of the world cannot be changed.

399
00:30:13,479 --> 00:30:14,985
Everything is decided by the heavens.

400
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:18,343
Even if you were around, his destiny would be the same.

401
00:30:19,704 --> 00:30:21,250
You have a long life after this.

402
00:30:22,016 --> 00:30:23,363
Some things can never be changed.

403
00:30:23,949 --> 00:30:26,896
However, it isn't too late to change certain things.

404
00:31:07,568 --> 00:31:08,641
Where's the demon?

405
00:31:11,969 --> 00:31:14,825
He has already realized his mistakes. He reverted to his true form.

406
00:31:26,561 --> 00:31:28,481
Dear, you don't need to worry about me that much

407
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:31,666
once I recover from this illness.

408
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:08,743
Celestial Master, there's one thing I need to tell you.

409
00:32:09,447 --> 00:32:10,520
What is it?

410
00:32:10,760 --> 00:32:13,546
I cannot save your spouse.

411
00:32:14,216 --> 00:32:15,856
What she's experiencing isn't an illness.

412
00:32:16,464 --> 00:32:17,730
It's her ordeal.

413
00:32:19,888 --> 00:32:21,635
I'll grant you my true form.

414
00:32:22,328 --> 00:32:26,266
Perhaps it might be of use to you when it's necessary.

415
00:33:19,888 --> 00:33:23,865
I heard that it took you quite some effort to resolve the affair

416
00:33:24,072 --> 00:33:26,104
between the massage hall and the hot spring last time.

417
00:33:26,128 --> 00:33:27,834
And you've started learning arithmetic.

418
00:33:28,127 --> 00:33:30,074
Lady Liu, you do know me the best.

419
00:33:31,160 --> 00:33:32,480
I'm just making some preparations

420
00:33:32,599 --> 00:33:35,357
so that I won't cause trouble if this happens again.

421
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:36,938
It won't happen again.

422
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:44,955
Were you waiting for me?

423
00:33:46,881 --> 00:33:48,150
Would you like to come with me?

424
00:33:50,352 --> 00:33:51,359
No.

425
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,513
Come on.

426
00:33:53,720 --> 00:33:54,946
Come on.

427
00:34:00,541 --> 00:34:02,493
Lady Liu, this is the place.

428
00:34:05,879 --> 00:34:07,546
Why exactly did you bring me here?

429
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:10,578
Of course it's to show you something nice.

430
00:34:10,983 --> 00:34:12,056
Have a seat.

431
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:22,261
Lady Liu, I've learned a new spell these past few days.

432
00:34:22,671 --> 00:34:23,744
Take a look.

433
00:34:38,873 --> 00:34:39,946
I...

434
00:34:41,264 --> 00:34:44,330
I did pick up a new spell.

435
00:34:47,127 --> 00:34:48,200
Let me try it again.

436
00:35:18,809 --> 00:35:19,882
Isn't it beautiful?

437
00:35:27,719 --> 00:35:28,792
Show yourself.

438
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:32,225
Huh? What does that mean?

439
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,672
Xuan Hui.

440
00:35:34,960 --> 00:35:36,185
Xuan Hui?

441
00:35:36,599 --> 00:35:37,672
Who said he was here?

442
00:35:38,360 --> 00:35:39,466
Where's Xuan Hui?

443
00:35:40,015 --> 00:35:41,481
It's almost winter.

444
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,439
There shouldn't be any fireflies around here.

445
00:35:44,249 --> 00:35:45,994
These should be Undying Fireflies.

446
00:35:46,249 --> 00:35:48,369
These are spirit bugs with a sliver of demonic power.

447
00:35:49,136 --> 00:35:52,785
You wouldn't be able to command them without Xuan Hui's help.

448
00:35:55,527 --> 00:35:57,327
I told you already. There's no deceiving her.

449
00:36:04,729 --> 00:36:06,328
Moreover, the Serpent Lord

450
00:36:06,424 --> 00:36:08,487
has always been aloof and nonchalant for the past century.

451
00:36:08,511 --> 00:36:10,177
Why would she like something like this?

452
00:36:11,392 --> 00:36:13,298
It seems to me that she liked it.

453
00:36:15,592 --> 00:36:18,819
It's dark and windy tonight. It's easy for one to see things, you know?

454
00:36:20,088 --> 00:36:21,434
I do like it a lot.

455
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:44,066
Are you two actually...

456
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:49,353
Xuan Hui.

457
00:36:50,639 --> 00:36:51,712
Come here.

458
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:53,953
What's the matter?

459
00:36:54,800 --> 00:36:55,873
Master Snake.

460
00:36:56,320 --> 00:36:57,546
Master Snake.

461
00:36:58,051 --> 00:36:59,611
It's inappropriate for you to sit here.

462
00:36:59,832 --> 00:37:01,097
You should stand.

463
00:37:03,681 --> 00:37:05,387
How could you let me stand?

464
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,953
You...

465
00:37:10,920 --> 00:37:11,993
Xuan Hui.

466
00:37:12,602 --> 00:37:14,728
It's been several months since you arrived at Chang'an.

467
00:37:14,752 --> 00:37:17,298
You can't just muddle through life like this.

468
00:37:18,224 --> 00:37:21,144
You just loaf around between Mei Residence and Liu Residence alternately.

469
00:37:21,617 --> 00:37:23,243
You should find something proper to do.

470
00:37:25,113 --> 00:37:26,859
Who said I was muddling through life?

471
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:29,665
I've never slacked off a single day as a cultivator.

472
00:37:30,456 --> 00:37:33,403
After all, I've cultivated my powers for 100 years.

473
00:37:33,777 --> 00:37:35,682
I would've transformed into a Rain Dragon

474
00:37:35,879 --> 00:37:37,768
and rose through the clouds like the carefree dragon I am

475
00:37:37,792 --> 00:37:41,418
had you not sent me to the Demon Prison.

476
00:37:42,179 --> 00:37:43,645
So, are you blaming me

477
00:37:44,047 --> 00:37:45,927
that you couldn't transform into a Rain Dragon?

478
00:37:46,559 --> 00:37:47,866
That is the case.

479
00:37:49,745 --> 00:37:53,090
Although Serpent Lord has let me down,

480
00:37:53,752 --> 00:37:55,392
and she isn't willing to apologize to me,

481
00:37:55,760 --> 00:37:57,706
I'm going to be a Rain Dragon eventually.

482
00:37:58,031 --> 00:38:01,458
By then, I'll soar through the clouds and leave Chang'an.

483
00:38:02,199 --> 00:38:05,433
Why would I hold it against a tiny serpent like her? Don't you agree?

484
00:38:05,599 --> 00:38:06,672
Fine.

485
00:38:07,000 --> 00:38:11,426
I'll wait and see as you bide your time to soar through the clouds, then.

486
00:38:11,917 --> 00:38:12,973
Master Snake, I believe

487
00:38:13,108 --> 00:38:15,360
that you can definitely transform into a Rain Dragon.

488
00:38:19,503 --> 00:38:20,576
Xuan Hui.

489
00:38:21,127 --> 00:38:22,834
You called me a tiny serpent just now.

490
00:38:23,480 --> 00:38:24,553
That's right.

491
00:38:49,360 --> 00:38:50,585
This is gorgeous.

492
00:39:26,239 --> 00:39:28,705
Take a nap if you're sleepy.

493
00:39:29,623 --> 00:39:31,970
A mortal like you had stayed up the entire night.

494
00:39:32,177 --> 00:39:33,642
It's normal for you to be sleepy.

495
00:39:33,840 --> 00:39:34,913
I'm fine.

496
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:36,858
I can withstand this.

497
00:39:45,010 --> 00:39:46,877
Lady Liu, you must be thirsty.

498
00:39:48,071 --> 00:39:49,144
Have some water.

499
00:39:55,519 --> 00:39:56,592
Here.
