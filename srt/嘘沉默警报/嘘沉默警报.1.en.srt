He is like a wet log, stuck to the ground

376
00:26:31,189 --> 00:26:34,519
You haven't met Kyeong Woo Say hi

377
00:26:34,609 --> 00:26:36,369
Nice to meet you Exclusive!

378
00:26:36,459 --> 00:26:39,359
I'm the best Kyeong Woo in Korea!

379
00:26:39,449 --> 00:26:41,949
Junior reporter in Society Desk,
Choi Kyeong Woo

380
00:26:42,029 --> 00:26:43,229
At your service

381
00:26:44,579 --> 00:26:46,979
What a spirit Nice to meet you

382
00:26:47,069 --> 00:26:49,689
I'm Han Jun Hyuk from Digital News Desk

383
00:26:49,779 --> 00:26:50,409
Work's not easy, right?

384
00:26:50,489 --> 00:26:54,589
I'm doing fine Editor Yang

385
00:26:54,669 --> 00:26:57,909
No, Captain Yang guides me

386
00:26:57,989 --> 00:27:00,829
so I've been thriving
like the sky's the limit

387
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:04,079
No one guided you

388
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:06,569
Society Desk Deputy Editor,
Yang Yoon Kyeong

389
00:27:06,719 --> 00:27:08,086
[Yang Yoon Kyeong
- Society Desk Deputy Editor]

390
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:12,289
She's my mentor from my junior years

391
00:27:12,729 --> 00:27:14,199
Useless

392
00:27:14,289 --> 00:27:16,669
Follow them!

393
00:27:16,759 --> 00:27:21,019
She is Daily Korea's first
female reporter for Seoul Police

394
00:27:21,109 --> 00:27:25,949
So still prefers to be called "Captain"

395
00:27:26,029 --> 00:27:27,629
I'm from Daily Korea!

396
00:27:33,539 --> 00:27:34,889
What do I do with him?

397
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:40,299
Sorry, Captain

398
00:27:40,389 --> 00:27:42,529
I got a splinter in my butt

399
00:27:42,939 --> 00:27:45,889
Unlike Manager Kim,
she is a rebel to her boss

400
00:27:45,979 --> 00:27:48,009
I'm going to quit!

401
00:27:48,269 --> 00:27:50,289
And devil to her subordinates

402
00:27:50,379 --> 00:27:53,279
You can't like her or hate her completely

403
00:27:54,409 --> 00:27:58,229
She never failed to meet a deadline

404
00:27:58,319 --> 00:28:00,649
while raising 2 kids alone

405
00:28:01,629 --> 00:28:05,709
She is one of the few real
reporters left in Daily Korea

406
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:07,589
But

407
00:28:08,069 --> 00:28:13,469
That filthy mouth never changes

408
00:28:15,009 --> 00:28:18,489
Shut up, I'm eating

409
00:28:19,209 --> 00:28:21,019
You, go home

410
00:28:21,109 --> 00:28:22,959
Send me the draft by 2:00

411
00:28:23,039 --> 00:28:24,209
Okay

412
00:28:26,289 --> 00:28:30,739
I will see you tomorrow
all improved and refreshed

413
00:28:31,689 --> 00:28:32,929
Exclusive!

414
00:28:35,249 --> 00:28:36,949
Good night!

415
00:28:37,369 --> 00:28:42,059
Exclusive! Exclusive! Exclusive!

416
00:28:43,699 --> 00:28:44,899
Man

417
00:28:45,249 --> 00:28:47,099
This is not the Marine Corps

418
00:28:47,189 --> 00:28:49,539
Stop hazing him Don't you feel bad?

419
00:28:49,629 --> 00:28:51,469
I feel so bad

420
00:28:51,819 --> 00:28:55,459
I'm helping him realize
his situation and quit

421
00:28:55,549 --> 00:29:01,639
He'll either give up on his own,
or compromise and stay

422
00:29:01,729 --> 00:29:04,909
They are so different than us

423
00:29:04,999 --> 00:29:07,659
"BAP" is mightier than "PEN"

424
00:29:07,749 --> 00:29:09,939
That was one of the intern's motto

425
00:29:10,019 --> 00:29:11,069
Whoa!

426
00:29:11,559 --> 00:29:13,069
Smart

427
00:29:13,159 --> 00:29:18,509
Despite my hazing, no one bats an eye

428
00:29:18,589 --> 00:29:21,309
They stick to their job for their life

429
00:29:21,759 --> 00:29:25,089
You saw Kyeong Woo saluting "Exclusive"

430
00:29:25,179 --> 00:29:27,709
He actually got one

431
00:29:27,799 --> 00:29:28,899
Exclusive?

432
00:29:33,069 --> 00:29:34,495
[MP Go Soo Do's illegal solicitation list
for the recruitment of Geumon Company]

433
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:39,729
Geumon Company where all of
the new recruits are illegally solicited?

434
00:29:39,819 --> 00:29:45,039
They had a priority hire for the locals
after building an industrial complex

435
00:29:45,609 --> 00:29:49,489
MP Go was born and bred in Geumon

436
00:29:49,579 --> 00:29:51,019
And it's his third term

437
00:29:54,099 --> 00:29:56,519
Wow, this guy

438
00:29:57,219 --> 00:30:01,319
There really was a
solicitation list for MP Go

439
00:30:02,349 --> 00:30:08,199
I can't imagine how the disqualified
would feel when they see this

440
00:30:08,669 --> 00:30:16,669
So his junior label will soon
be off with such a big exclusive

441
00:30:16,809 --> 00:30:18,019
Of course

442
00:30:18,669 --> 00:30:24,129
So unlike that old junior I once had

443
00:30:25,319 --> 00:30:26,559
Who?

444
00:30:28,909 --> 00:30:31,739
Right, that guy

445
00:30:32,649 --> 00:30:36,789
You, stupid Junior!

446
00:30:36,879 --> 00:30:40,159
All you have done is poop and get old?

447
00:30:44,649 --> 00:30:46,099
Did I really say that?

448
00:30:46,179 --> 00:30:50,969
That poor guy got called
stupid 300 times a day

449
00:30:51,059 --> 00:30:54,459
You got a promising junior Teach him well

450
00:30:55,609 --> 00:30:57,819
Who said promising?

451
00:30:59,629 --> 00:31:02,509
I can't even guarantee he would stay

452
00:31:03,129 --> 00:31:05,149
Do you admit your illegal solicitation

453
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:07,439
for the recruitment of Geumon Company?

454
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:08,619
MP Go!

455
00:31:09,539 --> 00:31:12,199
Do you realize there is a
personal solicit list for you?

456
00:31:12,289 --> 00:31:13,859
You're from Daily Korea, right?

457
00:31:14,699 --> 00:31:17,299
Great job you're doing

458
00:31:17,689 --> 00:31:20,659
Don't skip your meal even if you're busy

459
00:31:20,959 --> 00:31:22,609
You'll hurt yourself

460
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:24,179
What?

461
00:31:27,529 --> 00:31:28,799
Okay

462
00:31:31,329 --> 00:31:33,989
That innocent kid just smiled

463
00:31:34,079 --> 00:31:38,149
How could he know that's
a warning for him to stop

464
00:31:38,469 --> 00:31:41,229
if he wants to keep his job?

465
00:31:41,309 --> 00:31:44,489
I don't know what to say to him

466
00:31:44,579 --> 00:31:48,379
Push ahead or tactfully lay down

467
00:31:51,649 --> 00:31:53,689
Guess my days are over too

468
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,529
Goodness

469
00:31:55,609 --> 00:31:59,319
What got you down today?

470
00:31:59,409 --> 00:32:01,639
You've seen that spectacle before

471
00:32:01,729 --> 00:32:02,919
I know

472
00:32:03,589 --> 00:32:08,079
But I don't want to see them anymore

473
00:32:08,819 --> 00:32:10,449
Might just quit

474
00:32:11,899 --> 00:32:14,899
What? You've made it this far

475
00:32:15,299 --> 00:32:17,699
No way My superiors endured me

476
00:32:17,789 --> 00:32:20,349
If I was a dude,
I would have been long gone

477
00:32:20,969 --> 00:32:25,639
I was on TV for being the
first female Daily Korea reporter

478
00:32:25,729 --> 00:32:28,919
for the Seoul Police and future's
first female City Desk Editor

479
00:32:29,149 --> 00:32:30,479
They couldn't just fire me

480
00:32:31,619 --> 00:32:36,609
If you know that, hold on with your life

481
00:32:36,699 --> 00:32:42,039
Work, Trust, and Forgive! WTF!

482
00:32:42,819 --> 00:32:48,599
Sae Jun is actually the most
obedient one in the whole press

483
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:50,129
That stupid Chief

484
00:32:50,219 --> 00:32:52,009
Chief, my butt

485
00:32:52,169 --> 00:32:58,639
He will survive for 3 years
only eating off his jerkiness

486
00:32:58,729 --> 00:33:04,479
I will really do my best starting tomorrow

487
00:33:04,569 --> 00:33:10,649
Bro, you really love the Chief

488
00:33:12,049 --> 00:33:14,069
Get up, let's go home

489
00:33:14,289 --> 00:33:15,439
Am I home?

490
00:33:15,529 --> 00:33:17,259
No

491
00:33:18,229 --> 00:33:19,589
I'll call a cab and come back

492
00:33:19,669 --> 00:33:21,519
Don't, I'm going home too

493
00:33:21,609 --> 00:33:23,009
The newspaper

494
00:33:23,089 --> 00:33:26,689
Your priority is the newspaper?

495
00:33:26,879 --> 00:33:29,739
Hi sweetie, finished your lessons?

496
00:33:31,779 --> 00:33:34,569
Yeah Mom's going home now

497
00:33:45,359 --> 00:33:48,919
So Digital News Desk is
their final training place?

498
00:33:49,009 --> 00:33:50,159
Yes

499
00:33:50,879 --> 00:33:55,219
Did you have good experience at
City Desk and International Desk?

500
00:33:55,839 --> 00:33:56,979
Yes

501
00:34:07,259 --> 00:34:10,709
Oh Soo Yeon,
you have a lot of internship experience

502
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:15,389
Yes, I wanted to have as
many experiences as possible

503
00:34:15,829 --> 00:34:19,139
Right Experience is the best qualification

504
00:34:19,549 --> 00:34:23,209
You all dream of being a reporter?

505
00:34:23,298 --> 00:34:24,679
Yes

506
00:34:24,769 --> 00:34:32,649
My dream is all of you being hired
as regular reporters of Daily Korea

507
00:34:33,169 --> 00:34:36,889
Could you make my dream come true?

508
00:34:36,979 --> 00:34:38,489
Yes

509
00:34:39,949 --> 00:34:40,989
Yes

510
00:34:45,229 --> 00:34:46,669
He didn't mean it

511
00:34:46,758 --> 00:34:47,758
Why?

512
00:34:48,028 --> 00:34:50,289
There must be a fixed number

513
00:34:50,379 --> 00:34:54,249
They can't hire all 4 of us

514
00:34:55,329 --> 00:34:57,179
I guess that's true

515
00:34:57,469 --> 00:34:58,469
Really?

516
00:34:58,758 --> 00:35:01,798
Do you really think the Chief exaggerated?

517
00:35:01,879 --> 00:35:04,258
That's what Editors do

518
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:07,909
It's not decided, so don't worry for now

519
00:35:08,379 --> 00:35:10,609
Of course

520
00:35:11,299 --> 00:35:16,779
Did you hear about our
trainer in Digital News Desk?

521
00:35:16,859 --> 00:35:17,949
No Who is it?

522
00:35:18,039 --> 00:35:20,629
I don't know the first
name It's reporter Han

523
00:35:20,869 --> 00:35:22,529
Reporter Han Jun Hyuk

524
00:35:22,999 --> 00:35:25,269
A living legend since his junior years

525
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:28,299
Han Jun Hyuk?

526
00:35:30,209 --> 00:35:32,629
What's so special about him?

527
00:35:46,569 --> 00:35:50,439
Morning, guys

528
00:35:50,519 --> 00:35:51,849
This platform is

529
00:35:52,979 --> 00:35:56,359
It's the most important one

530
00:35:56,979 --> 00:35:59,519
There are fewer readers

531
00:36:07,359 --> 00:36:09,329
Are there any issues?

532
00:36:09,419 --> 00:36:11,339
Nothing much

533
00:36:16,239 --> 00:36:18,939
Is it going to rain?

534
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:23,889
I have to bring in the laundry

535
00:36:24,819 --> 00:36:29,079
You just got here It's not going to rain

536
00:36:30,019 --> 00:36:31,519
What on earth are you doing?

537
00:36:32,689 --> 00:36:34,539
What do you think a fisher's job is?

538
00:36:34,629 --> 00:36:36,979
Sit tight and wait for
the fish to be hooked

539
00:36:37,059 --> 00:36:40,139
You also need to put fresh bait

540
00:36:40,229 --> 00:36:42,869
Sitting and doing nothing
won't bring any fish

541
00:36:42,959 --> 00:36:45,299
I'm going to put some new bait

542
00:36:45,389 --> 00:36:47,129
And bring in some laundry

543
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:48,809
Sit down

544
00:36:48,899 --> 00:36:51,539
Why? What's going on?

545
00:36:52,839 --> 00:36:54,499
Intern training assessment

546
00:36:54,889 --> 00:36:56,279
Chief's orders

547
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:01,475
[Intern Profiles]

548
00:37:01,499 --> 00:37:02,499
Intern training?

549
00:37:03,839 --> 00:37:05,039
Me?

550
00:37:08,479 --> 00:37:10,409
Let's see

551
00:37:12,629 --> 00:37:15,709
Hot Americano for me

552
00:37:15,789 --> 00:37:19,909
Choose whatever you want

553
00:37:23,499 --> 00:37:24,419
I'll go

554
00:37:24,509 --> 00:37:25,659
It's okay

555
00:37:25,749 --> 00:37:29,739
Company's paying for it,
so don't mind the price

556
00:37:29,829 --> 00:37:30,829
Okay

557
00:37:31,019 --> 00:37:32,959
We'll come here often

558
00:37:33,049 --> 00:37:35,669
Easy to eat when you're busy

559

The problem is that the

Yeah Age doesn't matter

600
00:40:01,529 --> 00:40:05,239
The problem is her academic background

601
00:40:06,109 --> 00:40:08,249
Age is only a number,

602
00:40:08,329 --> 00:40:11,849
but academic background is not

603
00:40:12,859 --> 00:40:17,769
Unfortunately,
she will never open that last door

604

That's enough for him to forget
and return to his original self

613

Jun Hyuk is disobedient but he writes well

614
00:41:26,149 --> 00:41:28,009
He was a good reporter back then

615
00:41:28,089 --> 00:41:29,199

Nowadays I hear he
doesn't write useless stories

620

Instead,
he sits tight and fishes his time away

621

Yes, usually

Sometimes he gets sassy, though

623
00:41:54,689 --> 00:41:58,929
That's the beauty of company life

624
00:41:59,009 --> 00:42:02,449

Responsibility?

638

When you get to be a regular reporter,

639

What?

There will only be criticism from your boss
