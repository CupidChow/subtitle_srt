00:13:13,638 --> 00:13:14,638
Unlike someone

191
00:13:18,358 --> 00:13:19,958
Who is he talking about?

192
00:13:21,858 --> 00:13:23,448
Looks delicious

193
00:13:26,578 --> 00:13:28,628
Desk said okay

194
00:13:29,158 --> 00:13:30,204
Really?

195
00:13:30,228 --> 00:13:32,238
They did

196
00:13:32,538 --> 00:13:34,218
What do you think?

197
00:13:36,688 --> 00:13:37,688
3 years ago,

198
00:13:37,758 --> 00:13:41,298
an influential prosecutor got investigated

199
00:13:41,448 --> 00:13:46,384
MP Go interrupted it
by shutting up other MPs

200
00:13:46,408 --> 00:13:48,128
And it led to criticism about

201
00:13:48,208 --> 00:13:50,788
how Go Soo Do, prosecutor-turned-MP,

202
00:13:50,868 --> 00:13:52,324
defends his own kind

203
00:13:52,348 --> 00:13:55,688
You were the first to run the story, right?

204
00:13:55,948 --> 00:14:01,074
Because of that, MP Go almost sued me

205
00:14:01,098 --> 00:14:03,994
He almost killed our CEO for that

206
00:14:04,018 --> 00:14:07,824
Torturing him with a tax investigation

207
00:14:07,848 --> 00:14:10,368
CEO is getting revenge

208
00:14:10,438 --> 00:14:12,634
in the disguise of an exclusive?

209
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:18,114
He might be getting
the most of this situation

210
00:14:18,138 --> 00:14:19,888
I don't know

211
00:14:19,968 --> 00:14:25,398
He might just want traffic
for the awaited exclusive

212
00:14:25,478 --> 00:14:28,718
to bring in more advertisers

213
00:14:30,088 --> 00:14:32,884
He's striking the iron while it's hot

214
00:14:32,908 --> 00:14:35,868
What's important is the outcome

215
00:14:35,948 --> 00:14:40,008
Whatever the reason, it's our exclusive

216
00:14:40,358 --> 00:14:43,708
Yeah, exclusives are a good thing

217
00:14:45,578 --> 00:14:48,538
But I can't stop doubting

218
00:14:49,678 --> 00:14:51,664
Darn it!

219
00:14:51,688 --> 00:14:55,588
I must have PTSD with the name "Go"

220
00:14:56,108 --> 00:14:59,068
Let's recheck the list

221
00:15:12,118 --> 00:15:13,368
What's this?

222
00:15:15,308 --> 00:15:18,028
It's the original of the list we have

223
00:15:18,098 --> 00:15:21,648
Written by a former HR employee

224
00:15:22,028 --> 00:15:24,514
What? The original?

225
00:15:24,538 --> 00:15:27,268
Our source copied it in a spreadsheet

226
00:15:27,338 --> 00:15:28,914
It's the same as the original

227
00:15:28,938 --> 00:15:31,274
It's not a classified document,

228
00:15:31,298 --> 00:15:32,868
so no illegal acquisition

229
00:15:33,308 --> 00:15:35,428
It's really the same

230
00:15:42,848 --> 00:15:46,874
Were you busy getting this?

231
00:15:46,898 --> 00:15:48,734
You want to be my favorite?

232
00:15:48,758 --> 00:15:49,924
No, it's actually

233
00:15:49,948 --> 00:15:52,204
What do you mean no? She's right

234
00:15:52,228 --> 00:15:55,978
He had a hard time getting that

235
00:15:57,028 --> 00:15:58,704
Really

236
00:15:58,728 --> 00:16:02,104
Captain Yang always
gets the best underlings

237
00:16:02,128 --> 00:16:05,104
You have me, don't you?

238
00:16:05,128 --> 00:16:08,124
I'm your senior in Drudge News Desk

239
00:16:08,148 --> 00:16:10,094
Right, you are

240
00:16:10,118 --> 00:16:13,594
You are a reliable senior

241
00:16:13,618 --> 00:16:14,674
Welcome

242
00:16:14,698 --> 00:16:18,598
Kyeong Woo has a good friend

243
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,798
Your first exclusive thanks to that angel

244
00:16:23,538 --> 00:16:28,778
Put "Reporter Choi
Kyeong Woo" in the by-line

245
00:16:29,708 --> 00:16:31,604
Really?

246
00:16:31,628 --> 00:16:33,108
Lose the "junior"

247
00:16:34,558 --> 00:16:35,878
Awesome!

248
00:16:36,028 --> 00:16:37,014
Fight on!

249
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:37,888
Thank you

250
00:16:37,968 --> 00:16:40,034
I'll do my best, exclusive!

251
00:16:40,058 --> 00:16:44,578
Desk will punish with the exclusive!

252
00:16:47,218 --> 00:16:48,528
Thank you!

253
00:17:25,407 --> 00:17:27,068
Come in

254
00:17:40,088 --> 00:17:42,468
Take the gift from Namwoo Group

255
00:17:43,048 --> 00:17:44,308
It's an orchid

256
00:17:44,648 --> 00:17:46,868
I will care for it

257
00:17:49,598 --> 00:17:50,754
MP Go's story?

258
00:17:50,778 --> 00:17:53,658
It's running on tomorrow's morning paper

259
00:17:54,748 --> 00:17:57,044
Is the trial the day after tomorrow?

260
00:17:57,068 --> 00:17:57,845
Yes

261
00:17:57,869 --> 00:18:00,588
You were complaining about the low traffic

262
00:18:00,948 --> 00:18:02,238
It's just in time

263
00:18:03,328 --> 00:18:07,014
Acknowledge Editor Yoon for me

264
00:18:07,038 --> 00:18:08,084
I will

265
00:18:08,108 --> 00:18:09,158
But

266
00:18:10,238 --> 00:18:11,524
Would it be okay?

267
00:18:11,548 --> 00:18:15,118
You weren't sure about
it from the beginning

268
00:18:16,018 --> 00:18:17,978
It might not be okay

269
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,374
But the arrow already left the bow

270
00:18:20,398 --> 00:18:25,014
We want to raise suspicion,
not reveal the facts

271
00:18:25,038 --> 00:18:26,728
You shouldn't worry too much

272
00:18:27,098 --> 00:18:28,238
Okay

273
00:18:29,088 --> 00:18:32,398
Editor Yoon is contacting the Prosecution

274
00:18:32,928 --> 00:18:36,964
We will hear from him tomorrow

275
00:18:36,988 --> 00:18:37,825
Okay

276
00:18:37,849 --> 00:18:41,218
I hope other issues come
up and cast a shadow

277
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:42,738
If it doesn't,

278
00:18:43,388 --> 00:18:45,224
clean up the mess yourself

279
00:18:45,248 --> 00:18:49,398
I will, according to the situation

Do you have something to say?

Hey!

I'm not talking about "BAP" anymore

292
00:19:44,238 --> 00:19:46,018
I like chicken too

"Spicy Chicken"?

What?

318
00:21:36,088 --> 00:21:38,598
I saw you were here with Soo Yeon

319
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:40,308
What do you want to learn?

320
00:21:40,688 --> 00:21:42,198
I don't know yet

321
00:21:42,548 --> 00:21:45,344
So it was you

322
00:21:45,368 --> 00:21:47,738
I knew it

323
00:21:48,038 --> 00:21:50,398
It's because of that?

324
00:21:50,788 --> 00:21:51,858
No

325
00:21:52,888 --> 00:21:57,138
But because of what you said to her

00:21:59,048 --> 00:22:00,138
What I said?

Hey, that's exactly how it sounds

333
00:22:23,868 --> 00:22:27,354
It's not decided, so she might get it

334
00:22:27,378 --> 00:22:28,718
Might?

about an undecided fact

336
00:22:35,188 --> 00:22:36,518
Wait

337
00:22:36,668 --> 00:22:39,418
Are you

338
00:22:41,028 --> 00:22:42,364
Stalking me?

339
00:22:42,388 --> 00:22:43,388
What?

340
00:22:49,358 --> 00:22:51,928
Just what I expected

341
00:22:52,458 --> 00:22:55,298
You think you matter that much?

342
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:13,904
Have this, and beat your brain

343
00:23:13,928 --> 00:23:16,248
Think about who you are

344
00:23:16,908 --> 00:23:17,908
What?

345
00:23:20,808 --> 00:23:23,558
Hey, Lee Ji Soo!

346
00:23:47,098 --> 00:23:50,834
Didn't you bring any soju?

347
00:23:50,858 --> 00:23:53,304
Excuse me, Mr Han

348
00:23:53,328 --> 00:23:56,604
Dad, you have liver disease

349
00:23:56,628 --> 00:23:58,688
And you bring me this crap?

350
00:23:59,208 --> 00:24:01,884
Darn, it's all over my hand now

351
00:24:01,908 --> 00:24:03,974
Crap? Then don't eat it

352
00:24:03,998 --> 00:24:05,828
I'm eating!

354
00:24:09,298 --> 00:24:11,408
You seem to drink too much

355
00:24:11,728 --> 00:24:13,584
Are you doing well?

356
00:24:13,608 --> 00:24:15,618
Don't worry about me

357
00:24:15,698 --> 00:24:17,464
Take care of yourself

358
00:24:17,488 --> 00:24:18,948
I'm just

359
00:24:29,478 --> 00:24:30,718
Dad

360
00:24:31,308 --> 00:24:32,358
What?

361
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,258
I'm curious

362
00:24:36,128 --> 00:24:37,968
What kind of person were you?

363
00:24:38,838 --> 00:24:42,108
What an odd question

364
00:24:43,188 --> 00:24:44,668
It's because

365
00:24:45,508 --> 00:24:49,478
Someone told me to think about who I am

366
00:24:49,958 --> 00:24:53,278
Come to think of it,

367
00:24:53,908 --> 00:24:56,984
I was a very passionate guy

368
00:24:57,008 --> 00:25:01,598
When the school fired me for no reason,

369
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:04,048
I didn't lose my dignity

370
00:25:05,928 --> 00:25:07,108
Really?

371
00:25:07,768 --> 00:25:10,514
Were you not angry about it?

372
00:25:10,538 --> 00:25:14,388
Why not? I was crazy angry

373
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:22,718
I wanted to fling sewage
at the principal's office

374
00:25:25,938 --> 00:25:27,338
But

375
00:25:28,628 --> 00:25:32,288
After a while, I was just afraid

376
00:25:32,508 --> 00:25:33,558
Why the heck?

377
00:25:33,728 --> 00:25:37,068
What do you think? It
was all because of you

378
00:25:38,138 --> 00:25:41,918
You just got into middle school then

379
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:45,878

Darn that Lee Jae Eun

579
00:41:48,667 --> 00:41:50,813
What? Night duty on an intern?

580
00:41:50,837 --> 00:41:52,423
Insane witch!

581
00:41:52,447 --> 00:41:56,577
She said her kid suddenly
has been sick for a few days

582
00:41:57,027 --> 00:41:59,753
Is that even grammatically correct?

583
00:41:59,777 --> 00:42:01,587

585
00:42:03,827 --> 00:42:05,763
I saw her kid this morning

586
00:42:05,787 --> 00:42:07,857
I know her whole family

587
00:42:07,947 --> 00:42:09,687
They are built so strong

589
00:42:13,067 --> 00:42:16,343
She's worse than I thought

590
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:19,927

Don't, please

00:42:29,337 --> 00:42:32,193
You'll only be making Soo Yeon a snitch

596

She wants to do it for her last day

597
00:42:40,567 --> 00:42:45,487
I will tear Jae Eun to bits tomorrow

598
00:42:45,727 --> 00:42:47,557
Go to our usual place

599
00:42:47,637 --> 00:42:49,043
I'll meet you there

It's nothing

Why do you insist on this place?

This Gomtang

Is there something wrong?

622

There's this smart intern in my office

And the company wants me to sack her

not prestigious enough
