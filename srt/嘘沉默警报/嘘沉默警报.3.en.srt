We only have this from her intern application.

188
00:16:47,499 --> 00:16:49,559
It’s the prettiest one.

189
00:16:52,199 --> 00:16:54,639
Because she tried to look her best when she took this.

[Daily Korea]

191
00:17:20,138 --> 00:17:24,368
I called everywhere I could.

192
00:17:27,779 --> 00:17:31,649
Yes. I called everywhere I could, too, but...

193
00:17:31,649 --> 00:17:33,779
We can’t really do anything online.

194
00:17:35,659 --> 00:17:37,689
The problem is trending topics.

195
00:17:37,689 --> 00:17:39,088
Is it still ranked at the top?

196
00:17:39,088 --> 00:17:39,979
Yes.

197
00:17:40,539 --> 00:17:44,509
We are filtering any briefs every time they come up.

198
00:17:44,509 --> 00:17:47,279
It’s not a major trend in social media,

199
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:48,639
so it will go down soon.

200
00:17:55,579 --> 00:17:57,779
Something else needs to blow up.

201
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:06,089
How long until MP Go’s trial result?

202
00:18:06,089 --> 00:18:08,189
Today was the last hearing,

203
00:18:08,269 --> 00:18:10,149
so you will see it on the evening news.

204
00:18:12,629 --> 00:18:16,629
It’s ironic to hope his news would cover up ours.

205
00:18:16,629 --> 00:18:18,089
Don’t worry too much.

206
00:18:18,089 --> 00:18:22,879
Dozens of people kill themselves every day.

207
00:18:23,399 --> 00:18:28,129
It’s the problem of the society, not our company.

208
00:18:31,309 --> 00:18:34,619
Take care of any disturbance at the funeral.

209
00:18:34,629 --> 00:18:35,519
Yes, sir.

210
00:18:35,979 --> 00:18:39,179
Send in Secretary Min on your way out.

211
00:18:53,319 --> 00:18:54,479
What do you think?

212
00:18:54,479 --> 00:18:56,289
I agree with the Chief.

213
00:18:56,289 --> 00:19:00,199
We might get over this smoothly if we don’t make a fuss.

214
00:19:00,599 --> 00:19:04,209
Should I call back Editor Yoon?

215
00:19:04,209 --> 00:19:05,009
Yeah.

216
00:19:05,489 --> 00:19:07,099
I told him not to come.

217
00:19:07,099 --> 00:19:08,579
His work is more important.

218
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:10,979
He should finish that first.

219
00:19:11,819 --> 00:19:13,499
I talked to him just a while ago.

220
00:19:13,809 --> 00:19:14,509
I understand.

221
00:19:14,509 --> 00:19:17,599
I will schedule your visit to the funeral at 9.

222
00:19:17,949 --> 00:19:18,849
Yeah.

223
00:19:27,759 --> 00:19:33,139
We will not be releasing any official statement for a while.

224
00:19:33,139 --> 00:19:33,989
What?

225
00:19:34,249 --> 00:19:35,249
Chief.

226
00:19:36,309 --> 00:19:40,239
Wouldn’t it be better to include an article for formality?

227
00:19:40,369 --> 00:19:44,429
A sloppy reaction might show as a guilty conscience.

228
00:19:44,429 --> 00:19:45,739
Guilty?

229
00:19:45,959 --> 00:19:47,249
Who’s guilty?

230
00:19:47,249 --> 00:19:48,939
We aren’t.

231
00:19:49,339 --> 00:19:52,869
I mean we don’t need to make things worse.

232

Do your usual work.

233
00:19:56,379 --> 00:20:00,289
No unnecessary buzz should leak.

234
00:20:01,549 --> 00:20:02,929

240

241
00:20:30,579 --> 00:20:31,489

00:20:37,349 --> 00:20:40,019
I’m going with the CEO later.

244

And the interns...

245
00:20:49,999 --> 00:20:54,079
Don’t worry. I’ll supervise them.

246
00:20:58,309 --> 00:21:02,889
I know it’s so very sad.

247
00:21:03,209 --> 00:21:06,179
But...

248
00:21:07,199 --> 00:21:10,469
Reporters work this way.

249
00:21:11,179 --> 00:21:19,039
Our job doesn’t change in sadness, anger, and delight.

250
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:23,609

00:21:35,459 --> 00:21:38,789
It’s of course a tragedy for us,

256
00:21:38,869 --> 00:21:41,599
but just a newsworthy incident for other press.

257
00:21:41,599 --> 00:21:44,369
No need for unnecessary attention.

258
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,109
But Editor, we have to...

259
00:21:47,109 --> 00:21:49,279
If you are spotted at the funeral,

260
00:21:49,369 --> 00:21:51,639
consider yourself fired.

00:22:00,859 --> 00:22:02,509

262
00:22:05,729 --> 00:22:07,109

263
00:22:07,109 --> 00:22:09,229
But we have to go.

264
00:22:09,309 --> 00:22:10,149
We spent 3 months...

265
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:12,899
That’s why he doesn’t want us to go.

266
00:22:13,519 --> 00:22:17,949
Reporters from other press will eat us alive for interviews.

267

The court admitted the illegal recruitment of Geumon company,

but acquitted MP Go based on the uncertainty of the list

that Daily Korea exclusively reported.

352
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:01,910
There are claims of possible fabrication,

353
00:28:01,910 --> 00:28:04,330

Why the heck?

743
01:00:45,034 --> 01:00:46,584
Stop talking like that!

744
01:00:47,484 --> 01:00:48,744
What did you say?

745
01:00:53,514 --> 01:00:55,534
Why the heck do you think?

746
01:00:55,824 --> 01:01:00,244
Everyone will forget this after a month.

747
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:01,804
No, after the funeral.

748
01:01:02,604 --> 01:01:04,384
So who’s going to confess?

749
01:01:05,354 --> 01:01:09,284
No one’s going to willingly confess to her murder!

750
01:01:15,364 --> 01:01:17,274
Don’t you agree?

751
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:25,814
At least one reporter has to dig deeper, right?

752
01:01:28,894 --> 01:01:31,684
Your mistake can’t be repeated.

753
01:01:33,994 --> 01:01:35,154
Mistake?

754
01:01:36,114 --> 01:01:38,664
The mistake you made 6 years ago.

755
01:01:40,824 --> 01:01:41,914
What?

756
01:01:44,034 --> 01:01:45,544
I know.

757
01:01:46,474 --> 01:01:49,574
I know what happened to you 6 years ago.

758
01:01:55,334 --> 01:01:56,774
Hey, Lee Ji Soo.

759
01:01:58,994 --> 01:02:00,804
How do you know?

760
01:02:27,079 --> 01:02:29,109
[Hush]

761
01:02:29,194 --> 01:02:33,184
[Are you still going to run as
if you don't know anything?]

762
01:02:33,284 --> 01:02:35,824
The impact to the company
is bigger than I've thought.

763
01:02:35,914 --> 01:02:37,144
How will the company react?

764
01:02:37,244 --> 01:02:39,294
Well, you can't escape
from writing a detailed report.

765
01:02:39,384 --> 01:02:41,904
Korea Daily's not
responsible for this, right?

766
01:02:42,234 --> 01:02:44,954
[Isn't this too much?
It's not long after the funeral ended...]

767
01:02:45,034 --> 01:02:46,374
[Do you think I want this?]

768
01:02:46,474 --> 01:02:47,684
[What else can we do
about the higher-ups' order?]

769
01:02:47,754 --> 01:02:48,834
News is a business too.

770
01:02:48,934 --> 01:02:53,284
Korea Daily is a newspaper company!
