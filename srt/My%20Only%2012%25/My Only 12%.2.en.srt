1
00:00:07,820 --> 00:00:10,140
What homework do we have today?

2
00:00:10,730 --> 00:00:13,420
I took a note about that,
I'll let you see.

3
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:15,900
But I won't let you copy.

4
00:00:15,900 --> 00:00:17,970
- Why!?
- Nope.

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:19,700
Please.

6
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:21,700
You're always like this.

7
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:24,450
Now I'm mad.

8
00:00:24,450 --> 00:00:27,050
Don't do this now.
Look at the cloud.

9
00:00:27,050 --> 00:00:29,980
So dark.
Looks like it might rain.

10
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:33,680
Please do not rain yet.
Let us be home first.

11
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,680
Did you bring an umbrella?

12
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:37,020
No. That's the thing.

13
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:39,020
I didn't know
it's gonna rain.

14
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:42,220
Cloud like this...

15
00:00:42,220 --> 00:00:44,500
It's not gonna rain.
Trust me.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:46,240
Um.

17
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,320
Ugh. We're almost home already.

18
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,320
Why is it raining?

19
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,480
Yeah.
How come?

20
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:01,020
Someone will probably
get sick for sure.

21
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:03,780
I'll be fine.

22
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:05,780
Just a little wet.

23
00:01:06,620 --> 00:01:08,440
You can be sick
by getting a little wet.

24
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:11,370
We can just run.

25
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,570
Run?

26
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:15,570
With these short legs?

27
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,460
Stop bugging me.

28
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:20,460
Here!

29
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,920
Take my bag.

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,370
Why?

31
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,000
Use it as a shield from the rain.

32
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
Then what about yourself?

33
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,690
I don't need it.
You get sick easily, you need it more.

34
00:01:29,690 --> 00:01:30,570
Hey!

35
00:01:30,570 --> 00:01:33,009
Don't hey to me.

36
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:37,020
Use it well.
Don't let the rain pour on you.

37
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,020
Um.

38
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:42,420
Take a shower once you get home,
so you won't get sick.

39
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:44,560
You talk like aunty Proud.

40
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:46,560
Stop it.

41
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:49,020
Let's go.
We've arrived.

42
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:52,020
- Follow me.
- Sure.

43
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
Be careful.
It's slippery, Cake!

44
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:06,640
It's raining.

45
00:02:10,169 --> 00:02:11,900
Damn!

46
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,850
You're not careful.
There's dirty water all over.

47
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:14,850
Huh?

48
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,440
- There.
- Oh...

49
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:17,980
I was hurried, Cake.

50
00:02:17,980 --> 00:02:19,980
Use your tissues to clean.

51
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:22,290
- You've got any?
- Yes.

52
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:24,980
- What?
- I'll clean it for you.

53
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:25,890
Hey Cake!
It's fine

54
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:28,380
- I can clean it myself.
- It's okay. I'll clean it for you.

55
00:02:35,300 --> 00:02:37,930
See. You're not careful
when you got off the bus.

56
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,570
You shoes are also untied.

57
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:41,570
Luckily, you didn't trip over.

58
00:02:51,140 --> 00:02:52,420
Cake! The wound.

59
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,420
Hmm?

60
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,960
Cake. You've got a wound.
You knee is scratched.

61
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:58,970
Look.

62
00:02:58,970 --> 00:03:00,970
Oh.

63
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,180
I tripped during a football game.

64
00:03:04,180 --> 00:03:05,010
Huh?

65
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:07,010
How come I didn't see it?

66
00:03:07,340 --> 00:03:09,010
How come did you notice it?

67
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,010
I was watching.

68
00:03:11,330 --> 00:03:13,400
- Watching?
- Um.

69
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:15,800
- Watching me?
- Um.

70
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:17,780
Well...

71
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:19,780
I was reading a book
on the building during lunch...

72
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:22,290
Oh!

73
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:25,290
You probably missed
the moment I fell.

74
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:28,400
Did you clean the wound properly?

75
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,060
Um.

76
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:31,720
- I rinsed it with water.
- What?

77
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:33,720
I guarantee you,
I'll be just fine.

78
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,600
It's nothing near death.

79
00:03:35,600 --> 00:03:36,530
Cake!

80
00:03:36,530 --> 00:03:40,500
Pao said rinsing with water is not enough.

81
00:03:40,500 --> 00:03:42,480
Why didn't you go see the nurse
at the infirmary?

82
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:44,000
Stop mocking me!

83
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,650
I was too lazy to go.

84
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:47,020
I will just go use
Betadine at home.

85
00:03:47,020 --> 00:03:48,320
You're always like this.

86
00:03:48,320 --> 00:03:50,760
Hundreds of bacteria probably
got inside already.

87
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:52,760
Don't worry about me.

88
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:54,760
You should worry about yourself.

89
00:03:56,140 --> 00:03:57,450
Are you cold?

90
00:03:59,450 --> 00:04:00,490
A bit.

91
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:02,220
Let's go home.

92
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:04,220
Hold my hand?

93
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,220
- Go!
- Hey! don't run Cake.

94
00:05:23,380 --> 00:05:26,130
Oh jeez!
You guys are all wet.

95
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,130
- Good afternoon aunty Proud.
- Hi.

96
00:05:28,490 --> 00:05:32,340
I was thinking that you guys
didn't bring the umbrellas.

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:37,920
Eiw.
Go take a shower first.

98
00:05:37,920 --> 00:05:40,420
Both of you,
go take a shower now.

99
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,600
Come down and have dinner
when you're done.

100
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:44,290
I will prepare hot curry
for you guys.

101
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:46,010
So you will be warmer.

102
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:47,010
Go.

103
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,130
Go now.

104
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,020
Use my bathroom, so Eiw can use yours.
No need to rush.

105
00:06:01,970 --> 00:06:04,460
Hey Eiw!
You're sleeping over today?

106
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:05,380
Yup.

107
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:08,240
I'll be here for 2 days this time.

108
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:09,540
Yeah! That's good.

109
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:11,880
I have some Math homework
I can't figure it out.

110
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:13,880
Cake cannot teach me at all.

111
00:06:14,500 --> 00:06:15,880
Ok. Ok.
Let's have a look.

112
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,880
- I'll teach you myself
- Ok.

113
00:06:17,880 --> 00:06:19,880
By the way,
Cake hasn't come down?

114
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:22,040
I haven't seen him
since I've been here.

115
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:24,320
Were you in
the room with him?

116
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,690
We went to take a shower separately.

117
00:06:27,690 --> 00:06:28,850
Oh.

118
00:06:28,850 --> 00:06:30,850
And how come you finished first?

119
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:32,850
Normally Cake showers so quick.

120
00:06:32,850 --> 00:06:35,040
He usually just walks
through the water.

121
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,020
Where are your folks anyway?

122
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:45,520
My dad went upstairs to change.

123
00:06:47,850 --> 00:06:49,860
Come on.
Let me help.

124
00:06:49,860 --> 00:06:51,300
Yeah. It's this one.

125
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:53,370
Aunty Proud,
is there anything I can help?

126
00:06:53,370 --> 00:06:55,010
That's fine.
It's almost done.

127
00:06:55,010 --> 00:06:57,010
You wait here ok Eiw?

128
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:58,620
Sure.

129
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,960
Let's do it Cream
...for about 10 questions.

130
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:07,460
What about Pao?
He's not home?

131
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:08,690
No.

132
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:10,050
He's driving my mom.

133
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:11,980
Ask about other people's brother...

134
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:13,980
...you probably forgot your own?

135
00:07:13,980 --> 00:07:15,980
You can start by
having half of his kindness.

136
00:07:15,980 --> 00:07:18,540
Why do I have to be kind
to a naughty kid?

137
00:07:18,540 --> 00:07:19,320
Who's naughty?

138
00:07:19,320 --> 00:07:21,320
Haha short arm.
Can't reach.

139
00:07:21,320 --> 00:07:23,320
Stop fighting.

140
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:26,400
Cream.
Go up and tell your dad to come down.

141
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,340
Sure.

142
00:07:27,340 --> 00:07:29,860
Cake come help me
bring all the plates.

143
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:31,690
Go help mom.

144
00:07:31,690 --> 00:07:32,650
Cake!

145
00:07:32,650 --> 00:07:34,140
Yess.

146
00:07:34,380 --> 00:07:36,140
Haha. You got scolded at.

147
00:07:36,140 --> 00:07:38,140
I'll help you.

148
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,140
Huh?
That's fine.

149
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:41,920
It's probably a few only.

150
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,570
It's okay.

151
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:45,690
You're easily jealous.

152
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:47,690
What am I gonna do
when you're jealous later?

153
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:49,690
Jealous about what?

154
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:51,850
Cream and Pao?

155
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:53,850
I don't know.

156
00:07:56,050 --> 00:07:59,580
The person
who'd be jealous is not me.

157
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:03,210
I remember when Cream used to be
super close with Pao...

158
00:08:03,210 --> 00:08:06,770
There's someone crying because he's afraid that
his brother would love someone else's more.

159
00:08:06,770 --> 00:08:09,090
Ughh. It was a long time ago.

160
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:11,090
I better go help aunty Proud in the kitchen.

161
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:13,490
Is there anything you would like me to help?

162
00:08:13,490 --> 00:08:15,010
Whiner.

163
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,010
Whiner.

164
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:32,280
I'm full.

165
00:08:32,280 --> 00:08:34,090
Excuse me.
I'm going upstairs.

166
00:08:34,090 --> 00:08:36,090
- Follow me when you're done?
- Um.

167
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:39,120
What's the matter with him?

168
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:41,570
He was so hurried,
afraid he was gonna choke.

169
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,049
Yeah.
He didn't even put the plate away.

170
00:08:44,960 --> 00:08:46,970
Probably went up and play games.

171
00:08:59,130 --> 00:08:59,700
*MSN sound*

172
00:08:59,700 --> 00:09:01,700
Cake. Cake.

173
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:06,010
What are you doin Cake?
Playing games?

174
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,010
Hmm?

175
00:09:08,010 --> 00:09:10,010
No. I'm on M.

176
00:09:10,380 --> 00:09:12,090
M...?

177
00:09:12,090 --> 00:09:13,680
You mean MSN?

178
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:15,680
I never see you're on this before.

179
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:20,420
I just registered.
It's fun.

180
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:22,420
Are you also on MSN?

181
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,410
No.

182
00:09:26,410 --> 00:09:28,160
Why would I wanna use it?

183
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,700
We use it to talk to people
at the school.

184
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:33,090
The whole school is using it.

185
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:37,090
I've got you here.

186
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:38,580
I don't see the need to use MSN.

187
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,580
I don't mean in that way.

188
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,580
Oh! It could be like...

189
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:44,580
when you're in your room,

190
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,980
you can talk to me at night.

191
00:09:50,540 --> 00:09:53,330
And who are you talking to?

192
00:09:53,330 --> 00:09:55,330
I'm talking to Rin.

193
00:09:55,960 --> 00:09:58,360
Rin? Which Rin?

194
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,140
She's a junior.

195
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,140
She's so pretty.

196
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:09,160
Why are you talking to her?

197
00:10:10,520 --> 00:10:14,000
We're kinda seeing each other.

198
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:16,980
Don't tell Cream.
She'll go tell my mom.

199
00:10:32,600 --> 00:10:34,610
Hom!

200
00:10:34,610 --> 00:10:36,610
What?
Why are you in a hurry?

201
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:39,400
Hom...are you gonna take Cake away from me?

202
00:10:39,400 --> 00:10:41,140
Huh what?

203
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,040
Will you take Cake away from me?

204
00:10:44,880 --> 00:10:46,380
Um...so...

205
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,880
Which Cake?
The human Cake or dessert Cake?

206
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:52,880
The human Cake.

207
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:56,680
Why would I take
Cake away from you?

208
00:10:56,680 --> 00:10:58,680
You don't like Cake?

209
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:02,160
No. It's not like I don't like him.

210
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:04,480
So you mean...you like him?

211
00:11:05,660 --> 00:11:06,820
Yup.

212
00:11:06,820 --> 00:11:09,960
But can you please
don't take him away from me?

213
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:12,770
Why would I do that?

214
00:11:12,770 --> 00:11:14,770
Cake is Eiw's friend.

215
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:16,440
Promise me?

216
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:18,440
Um I promise.

217
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,050
You're relieved right?

218
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:26,730
What a silly thought.

219
00:11:44,020 --> 00:11:46,820
See-Eiw. Cake.

220
00:11:46,820 --> 00:11:50,360
Wake up now.
It's 6.20am already.

221
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:56,530
We're up mom.

222
00:11:57,360 --> 00:12:00,220
Get up now.
You're late.

223
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:01,220
Sure.

224
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:17,330
See. You're sick.

225
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,040
Then you should rest today.
No need to go to school.

226
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,720
No. I can go.

227
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:36,290
You can't.

228
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,540
Go to sleep.
I'll be back.

229
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,640
- Cake
- Hmm?

230
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,530
I don't wanna be alone.

231
00:12:49,170 --> 00:12:51,340
I'll be back.
Just a moment.

232
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,340
I'll be quick.

233
00:13:09,420 --> 00:13:10,740
Hey!

234
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,490
Why're you crying?

235
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,570
Hmm?

236
00:13:23,940 --> 00:13:26,100
You're burning.

237
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:29,140
Easy.

238
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:35,200
You're always clingy
when you're sick.

239
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:37,200
That's why I told you
not to get sick.

240
00:13:38,580 --> 00:13:40,520
How can you stop from being sick?

241
00:13:41,780 --> 00:13:44,970
You were in the rain yesterday.
Told you to take some meds, but you didn't.

242
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:46,970
I don't know.

243
00:13:47,610 --> 00:13:49,600
I don't wanna miss school.

244
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,480
No. You have to.
You'll get worse if you don't rest.

245
00:13:54,360 --> 00:13:56,500
Staying at home is so chill too.

246
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,000
No.

247
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:02,000
I don't wanna be home alone.

248
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,050
Who said you're gonna be home alone?

249
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,010
Then who will be home with me?

250
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,980
I'll be here with you.

251
00:14:12,980 --> 00:14:15,440
- Would aunty Proud allow?
- Um.

252
00:14:16,160 --> 00:14:18,290
I already told her
you're having a fever.

253
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:20,450
I also have a headache.

254
00:14:20,450 --> 00:14:22,450
So mom is okay for us to miss school.

255
00:14:22,450 --> 00:14:24,450
She doesn't want us to
spread to others at school.

256
00:14:24,780 --> 00:14:26,450
Liar.

257
00:14:26,450 --> 00:14:28,450
You want me to leave you here alone?

258
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:31,730
No.

259
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:37,410
Comfy?

260
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:41,010
You're burning.

261
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,980
Ouch!

262
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:53,980
You're hungry?

263
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,980
Mom will bring us the porridge.

264
00:14:56,460 --> 00:14:59,520
Why don't you go help
your mom bringing it up?

265
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:04,680
How can I help her?

266
00:15:04,680 --> 00:15:05,680
You're on top of me like this.

267
00:15:09,020 --> 00:15:10,680
Get well soon.

268
00:15:10,680 --> 00:15:13,200
The day after tomorrow,
we'll have a fitness test too.

269
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:15,750
Ughh.

270
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:19,000
Telling me that
makes me more sick.

271
00:15:19,370 --> 00:15:22,100
I hate fitness test.

272
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:24,640
Why not?
It's fun.

273
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:27,380
I love it.

274
00:15:27,380 --> 00:15:30,000
You like it,
because you can do it.

275
00:15:30,000 --> 00:15:31,400
No.

276
00:15:31,400 --> 00:15:34,010
You'll need to exercise more then.

277
00:15:34,010 --> 00:15:36,010
Running a little bit,
and you're gonna faint already.

278
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:43,360
I'm not gonna argue with you anymore.
My throat hurts.

279
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:48,260
Go brush your teeth then.

280
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:50,020
So we can have some food and medicine.

281
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:52,020
Then rest.

282
00:16:37,740 --> 00:16:38,800
Oh.

283
00:16:48,530 --> 00:16:51,360
I thought you're gonna wake him
and wash up.

284
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:53,360
How come you're asleep?

285
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:55,360
Eiw is being clingy.

286
00:16:55,780 --> 00:16:58,400
He's sick.
That's why.

287
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,970
When he's sick,
it's always extreme.

288
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,440
Oh.

289
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:05,440
See.

290
00:17:05,440 --> 00:17:07,440
He's burning.

291
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:10,579
He makes me burning up too.

292
00:17:11,500 --> 00:17:13,540
Then wake him up.

293
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:15,010
Go wash up.

294
00:17:15,010 --> 00:17:17,010
and have some food.
Take the medicines.

295
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:19,500
If you keep sleeping like this.
You won't get better.

296
00:17:19,980 --> 00:17:21,500
Sure.

297
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:31,360
Did you bring the pork floss?

298
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:32,700
Yeah. I did.

299
00:17:32,700 --> 00:17:36,360
I also bring Chinese sausage,
your favorite.

300
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:39,980
Don't let him have it ok?
He's still coughing right?

301
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:44,780
But when Eiw sees,
he'll definitely want some.

302
00:17:44,780 --> 00:17:46,780
Then don't let hime have it.

303
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:49,480
Then...

304
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,240
you can just bring it down.

305
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:53,240
I will have pork floss with him.

306
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:55,570
It's your favorite!?

307
00:17:57,170 --> 00:17:59,170
I can have it when he's better.

308
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:02,650
You sure?

309
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:11,860
Then I'll bring it down, ok?

310
00:18:11,860 --> 00:18:13,220
Yes.

311
00:18:13,220 --> 00:18:15,940
Don't let me catch you playing games.

312
00:18:15,940 --> 00:18:17,440
or reading comic books ok?

313
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,440
If so, I'll have you two go to school.

314
00:18:20,690 --> 00:18:21,940
Mom!

315
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:23,100
We won't.

316
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
I will rest with Eiw now.

317
00:18:25,780 --> 00:18:28,130
Come on.
The porridge is getting cold.

318
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:30,130
Sure.

319
00:18:43,060 --> 00:18:43,980
Eiw.

320
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:45,980
Um.

321
00:18:46,520 --> 00:18:47,980
Don't keep the food in your mouth.

322
00:18:49,980 --> 00:18:51,560
Um.

323
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,890
I don't wanna have it anymore.

324
00:18:53,890 --> 00:18:57,040
Just chew it.
Don't keep it in there.

325
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,530
I don't wanna eat.

326
00:19:02,530 --> 00:19:04,000
Don't wanna eat what?

327
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:06,000
You only ate a little.

328
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,760
Eat some more.

329
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:09,760
No. I'm full.

330
00:19:13,690 --> 00:19:15,180
This morning...

331
00:19:15,180 --> 00:19:17,610
when you went down,
I saw your mom making pancake too.

332
00:19:17,610 --> 00:19:18,820
Really?

333
00:19:18,820 --> 00:19:20,170
Can I have one?

334
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:21,920
With lots of whipped cream.

335
00:19:21,920 --> 00:19:23,600
Sure.

336
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,600
I will ask mom to put lots of
chocolate sauce on too.

337
00:19:26,640 --> 00:19:28,010
But first...

338
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,480
You'll need to finish this.

339
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:35,920
I can't.

340
00:19:36,330 --> 00:19:38,240
Just take one bite.
One bite.

341
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:40,240
- Take it....here.
- No.

342
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:40,890
Please.

343
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:42,890
Can I just have a small bite?

344
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,560
Last bite.

345
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:48,010
Eat it. Here.

346
00:19:52,170 --> 00:19:54,620
- One more bite.
- No more.

347
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:57,490
I don't want it anymore.

348
00:20:00,180 --> 00:20:01,560
You're this full.

349
00:20:02,210 --> 00:20:04,050
Probably cannot have pancake already.

350
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:05,050
Cake!

351
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,050
Don't yell.

352
00:20:07,050 --> 00:20:07,930
You'll have a sore throat.

353
00:20:07,930 --> 00:20:09,930
You always tease me.

354
00:20:10,570 --> 00:20:13,040
Ah ok. Ok.

355
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:15,040
I will go down
and get you the dessert.

356
00:20:16,160 --> 00:20:17,650
Are you mad at me?

357
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:19,650
No I'm not.

358
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:32,680
I'll be back.

359
00:20:53,250 --> 00:20:54,700
Don't smile like that.

360
00:20:54,700 --> 00:20:56,700
Take this and go to sleep.

361
00:20:57,720 --> 00:20:59,100
,,,,,,,,,

362
00:21:07,650 --> 00:21:08,650
Um.

363
00:21:09,770 --> 00:21:11,220
Give me your hand.

364
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:14,460
Do not pout.

365
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:32,340
Told you to throw the meds
in your mouth first and water later.

366
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,780
It'll be bitter that way.

367
00:21:34,780 --> 00:21:37,410
It's not gonna be bitter,
the water will already run down your throat.

368
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:39,410
You don't get me.

369
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:41,410
Ok. I don't get it.

370
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,300
Hey! Where are you going?

371
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:48,100
You're not gonna take any meds?

372
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:50,100
I'm not sick.

373
00:21:50,340 --> 00:21:51,530
Why do I have to take meds?

374
00:21:51,530 --> 00:21:54,040
See.
You're such a Shepard boy. (liar)

375
00:21:54,040 --> 00:21:56,040
You said you're having a headache.

376
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,000
I'm here just to babysit you.

377
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:02,610
No. I'm a not a sheep
for you to take care.

378
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,330
Sheep.

379
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:13,980
I don't wanna argue
with you anymore.

380
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:15,980
I wanna go to sleep.

381
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:17,980
Wanna hug?

382
00:22:26,660 --> 00:22:28,660
- Oh.
- What are you laughing at?

383
00:22:31,360 --> 00:22:34,420
Go to sleep,
so you'll get better.

384
00:22:34,930 --> 00:22:36,420
Um.

385
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:42,540
Ow.

386
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:44,540
So hurt.

387
00:22:49,580 --> 00:22:52,360
Damn Cake. He didn't tell us
he's not coming to school.

388
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:55,080
The teacher punished me today.

389
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:58,180
Just a 4-5 hits,
why're you complaining?

390
00:22:58,180 --> 00:22:59,440
You're so weak.

391
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:01,440
You let Cake copied your homework.

392
00:23:01,660 --> 00:23:02,780
I can't help.

393
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:04,780
Who's gonna know
that he's not coming to school?

394
00:23:04,780 --> 00:23:07,080
He also has my homework.

395
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:10,100
And not coming.
I got in trouble because of him.

396
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Yeah. Eiw is also not here.

397
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Or both of them
skipped school to hang out?

398
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:16,100
Yeah. That's possible.

399
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:18,100
I don't know.

400
00:23:18,890 --> 00:23:21,220
Oh.You'll be fine.

401
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,920
Just a little hit.
Let me see.

402
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:24,440
A little hit?

403
00:23:24,440 --> 00:23:25,980
Not just 5-6 hits.

404
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:27,300
I also got spanked
during Math.

405
00:23:27,300 --> 00:23:29,300
- Why are you yelling?
- You said just a little hit?

406
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,300
- You said 5-6 hits.
- No.

407
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:33,300
You got 7.

408
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:35,300
- 5..6...8
- 7 hits.

409
00:23:35,300 --> 00:23:36,420
- 8, isn't it?
- 7

410
00:23:36,420 --> 00:23:37,780
- 8!
- 7

411
00:23:37,780 --> 00:23:39,780
- 8...
- You remember it incorrectly.

412
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,940
- There's...
- Stop making a fuss. Let me see.

413
00:23:41,940 --> 00:23:42,800
Come. Come. Come.

414
00:23:42,800 --> 00:23:45,010
Go get some first aid.
Take care of your child.

415
00:23:45,010 --> 00:23:48,010
I just got hit
-  Yeah. Let me see. I'll put some pain relief
on for you.

416
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,770
You want some more?

417
00:23:54,160 --> 00:23:55,180
Are you giving up yet?

418
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:57,400
In total 10 already?

419
00:23:58,140 --> 00:23:59,660
12.

420
00:23:59,660 --> 00:24:01,660
I'm giving you extra spank.

421
00:24:02,420 --> 00:24:05,040
I give up.
I give up.

422
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:07,040
Just one more.

423
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:58,130
Oh wow.

424
00:26:58,850 --> 00:27:01,210
Looks like a storm's gonna hit.

425
00:27:01,210 --> 00:27:03,900
- Cake coming down at this time.-
- You're overreacting.

426
00:27:04,210 --> 00:27:06,860
You got any sleep?
Or you were just playing games?

427
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:08,020
I didn't play.

428
00:27:08,020 --> 00:27:09,540
Last night Eiw had a fever.

429
00:27:09,540 --> 00:27:11,290
I tried to cool him down
with wet cloth all night.

430
00:27:11,290 --> 00:27:14,410
Ohh, how is he now?

431
00:27:14,410 --> 00:27:15,890
Still sleeping.

432
00:27:15,900 --> 00:27:18,410
I checked just now.
He's cool down a bit already.

433
00:27:18,860 --> 00:27:20,410
I see.

434
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,410
Is he gonna be able to go to school?

435
00:27:24,250 --> 00:27:27,300
There.
Bring that up and eat with him.

436
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,000
I prepared for you already.

437
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:29,940
Ok.

438
00:27:29,940 --> 00:27:32,560
If he's not fine then...

439
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:34,560
let him rest for another day.

440
00:27:35,530 --> 00:27:36,560
Sure.

441
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,580
- Don't smile.
- Hey.

442
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,580
- You need to go to school.
- What?

443
00:27:41,580 --> 00:27:44,180
- Go. Go.
- Cake is also sick, mom.

444
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:46,180
Oh right. The sick.
You're so sick.

445
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,520
Bring it up now.

446
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,580
- You are having a sickie.
- I can't even lift this see.

447
00:27:53,020 --> 00:27:54,900
Make him take the meds

448
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,240
Sure.

449
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,540
Be careful.
Don't spill it.

450
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,540
Oh Oh.

451
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:03,810
My son.

452
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:09,370
Come at me because you won't
win over me for sure.

453
00:28:13,970 --> 00:28:16,020
What the hell.
You scared me.

454
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:17,060
Any homework yesterday?

455
00:28:17,060 --> 00:28:19,060
Yes. We kept it for you.

456
00:28:19,060 --> 00:28:21,060
Trouble me.

457
00:28:21,060 --> 00:28:23,060
Just a little trouble,
won't hurt right?

458
00:28:23,060 --> 00:28:26,540
- Yes sir. Yes.
- Thank you Palm.

459
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:28,540
- Sure.
- Yess.

460
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,080
Yesterday, the teacher called your
during Math period.

461
00:28:33,460 --> 00:28:36,160
What's wrong with Mr.Piphop?
He always calls out my name.

462
00:28:36,560 --> 00:28:38,520
You always fall asleep, Sweetie.

463
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,520
- Wow.
- And also skipping school.

464
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:45,090
I didn't mean to skip.

465
00:28:45,090 --> 00:28:47,090
Eiw is sick.

466
00:28:47,090 --> 00:28:49,440
We were in the rain the other day...

467
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,100
...when we went home.

468
00:28:50,100 --> 00:28:52,290
Wait. Let me ask...

469
00:28:52,290 --> 00:28:55,260
You who I sneeze to your face,
and you don't feel a thing...

470
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:57,260
could get sick because of the rain?

471
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:00,640
Who said I'm sick?

472
00:29:00,640 --> 00:29:03,210
One more thing,
a weak germ like you...

473
00:29:03,210 --> 00:29:05,480
cannot do anything to me.

474
00:29:08,800 --> 00:29:12,600
So you admit it that
you're dirtier than me.

475
00:29:12,600 --> 00:29:16,180
Ah.. So you're not stopping.
You're not gonna stop right?

476
00:29:16,180 --> 00:29:18,920
Sure then come get a blessing from me.

477
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:20,920
Cake!

478
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:23,970
And is Eiw better?

479
00:29:23,970 --> 00:29:25,970
Um. He's better.

480
00:29:25,970 --> 00:29:28,410
Hey. Has he stopped
being uncomfortable around us?

481
00:29:30,170 --> 00:29:31,520
He's not uncomfortable.

482
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:33,140
He's scared of you guys.

483
00:29:33,140 --> 00:29:35,140
You guys are so loud.

484
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:39,170
Huh? Us? Loud?

485
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:45,640
Easy. Easy.

486
00:29:46,810 --> 00:29:49,650
Because of this, that's why
he doesn't know what to talk to you guys.

487
00:29:49,650 --> 00:29:51,650
Yeah. Even Cake who lives next door to him,

488
00:29:51,650 --> 00:29:53,650
he still doesn't talk to at school.

489
00:29:53,650 --> 00:29:55,650
And who are you Peak?

490
00:29:57,650 --> 00:30:00,020
But I wanna talk to Eiw actually.

491
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:02,020
Yeah.
He looks like I could tease him.

492
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:04,020
Hm Tease him?

493
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:06,020
- Teasing.
- Then you got this.

494
00:30:06,020 --> 00:30:08,020
Just do your damn homework.

495
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:11,130
Teased my friend.

496
00:30:12,050 --> 00:30:14,600
I will go use the bathroom
behind the agriculture building.

497
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:16,600
- See you at the line up.
- I'm goin' with you Peak.

498
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:17,600
Go.

499
00:30:17,970 --> 00:30:19,770
This early morning?

500
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:21,770
Yeah a bit.
Are you going?

501
00:30:22,250 --> 00:30:23,770
No.

502
00:30:24,330 --> 00:30:26,800
Why do they have to smoke that much?
It's stink.

503
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:29,440
True.
Their smell got me in trouble before.

504
00:30:30,810 --> 00:30:33,220
Yeah. We'll just use perfume
and have some candy.

505
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:35,000
Fuck it.
Let's go.

506
00:30:35,000 --> 00:30:36,130
Let's go. See you.

507
00:30:36,130 --> 00:30:37,100
Er.

508
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:40,010
Just be careful.
Don't let anyone see.

509
00:30:40,490 --> 00:30:42,010
Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:30:44,420 --> 00:30:46,970
Cake why do you have to
care about that?

511
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:48,970
Did you got in trouble
because of the smell before?

512
00:31:11,010 --> 00:31:13,010
What took him so long?

513
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,650
Sigh...Ugh.

514
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:33,540
Hmm?

515
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:35,170
Cake?

516
00:31:35,170 --> 00:31:37,170
Do you smoke?

517
00:31:37,850 --> 00:31:39,170
Huh?

518
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:41,170
- I don't
- Here.

519
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,620
And where does the smell come from?

520
00:31:45,250 --> 00:31:48,020
Oh. It's from Peak.

521
00:31:52,170 --> 00:31:53,970
Eiw.

522
00:31:54,930 --> 00:31:57,640
What? I don't smoke.

523
00:31:57,640 --> 00:31:59,100
I know.

524
00:31:59,100 --> 00:32:01,100
Know what?

525
00:32:01,610 --> 00:32:02,800
What are you doing?

526
00:32:02,800 --> 00:32:04,560
I want Cake to understand.

527
00:32:04,560 --> 00:32:06,680
Understand what?

528
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:08,680
I don't smoke.
Really.

529
00:32:08,680 --> 00:32:10,680
Smell my breath.

530
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,900
I know.

531
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,620
Cake come sit here.

532
00:32:15,620 --> 00:32:17,320
Sit.

533
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:20,620
And read every single webs here.

534
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:21,700
All of these.

535
00:32:21,700 --> 00:32:22,640
Yeah all of that.

536
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:23,600
Eiw.

537
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:26,060
Read it.
Stop whining.

538
00:32:28,810 --> 00:32:30,810
Read it. Focus.

539
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:33,170
Hey! UFO.

540
00:32:33,170 --> 00:32:35,170
No.
Where're you going?

541
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:40,720
Don't believe me?
Please stay focus.

542
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:42,720
Read all of the webs
I pulled up.

543
00:32:43,700 --> 00:32:44,720
Read it.

544
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,740
Yes. I'm reading.

545
00:32:56,690 --> 00:32:58,690
Worse than a teacher.

546
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:01,300
Speak of it, gives me a goosebump.

547
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:03,300
Let's continue my homework.

548
00:33:14,650 --> 00:33:16,940
Hey where're you going?

549
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:18,940
I'm going to the canteen.

550
00:33:22,250 --> 00:33:23,600
Did you take your medicine?

551
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:25,040
Um, I already did.

552
00:33:25,040 --> 00:33:26,760
Where're you going?

553
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,440
I'm going to the bathroom,
I'm goin to play football.

554
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,120
Oh.

555
00:33:32,120 --> 00:33:34,120
Then go.

556
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:36,880
Ok.

557
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:38,420
See you after school.

558
00:33:38,420 --> 00:33:39,980
See you.

559
00:33:39,980 --> 00:33:43,330
- Go. Then go.
- Cake, you'll rip my bag pack.

560
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:51,500
Aunty, can I have a glass of water?

561
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:01,240
- Aunty, can I have a red syrup drink?
- Can I also have one?

562
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:01,890
Wait a moment.

563
00:34:01,890 --> 00:34:03,890
We just finished a football match.

564
00:34:13,010 --> 00:34:14,340
Thank you aunty.

565
00:34:21,920 --> 00:34:23,969
Aunty, can I have one more
of the red syrup?

566
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:47,020
Why did he has
to kick so damn hard?

567
00:35:04,690 --> 00:35:06,060
Eiw.

568
00:35:07,130 --> 00:35:09,530
What's wrong?
Why the weird face?

569
00:35:11,570 --> 00:35:12,970
I bought red syrup drinks.

570
00:35:13,600 --> 00:35:14,970
So?

571
00:35:16,600 --> 00:35:18,600
Cake's been running a lot.
He might be exhausted.

572
00:35:19,680 --> 00:35:21,370
So I brought him this.

573
00:35:21,370 --> 00:35:23,620
But I don't wanna give him myself.

574
00:35:24,500 --> 00:35:26,890
Why?
Just giving it to him.

575
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:28,890
There're lots of people.

576
00:35:30,290 --> 00:35:33,960
Hey! Go give it to him yourself.
It will melt. Go.

577
00:35:33,960 --> 00:35:35,960
Just there. Go.

578
00:35:52,730 --> 00:35:54,730
- Thank you.
- Yes.

579
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:22,000
No need anymore.

580
00:36:50,850 --> 00:36:52,730
Oh my god.

581
00:36:52,730 --> 00:36:54,730
Cake.

582
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:56,730
Cake.

583
00:36:57,530 --> 00:36:59,180
Wake up kid.

584
00:37:00,170 --> 00:37:01,180
Ugh.

585
00:37:05,740 --> 00:37:08,570
Wake up.
It's already late.

586
00:37:11,460 --> 00:37:14,520
No. You're late.

587
00:37:14,520 --> 00:37:16,520
Wake up.

588
00:37:18,480 --> 00:37:19,700
What time is it?

589
00:37:19,700 --> 00:37:21,700
It's 6ish already.

590
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:25,120
Where's Eiw?

591
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,520
I ran out of the staples.
He went out to buy for me.

592
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:31,210
Why didn't he wake me up?

593
00:37:31,210 --> 00:37:32,760
How am I supposed to know?

594
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:35,280
He already did but
you probably didn't wake up.

595
00:37:35,850 --> 00:37:39,360
The alarm's so loud
you can still sleep.

596
00:37:40,360 --> 00:37:41,610
Go Go.

597
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,480
Get up.

598
00:37:43,480 --> 00:37:44,400
Get up now.

599
00:37:44,400 --> 00:37:46,400
I will go down
and pack some stuff.

600
00:37:46,400 --> 00:37:48,400
Sure.

601
00:38:23,290 --> 00:38:25,140
What's wrong?
Why didn't you wake me up this morning?

602
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:29,000
No I did,
but you didn't wake up yourself.

603
00:38:29,970 --> 00:38:32,640
Normally you wake me until I'm actually up.
What's the matter?

604
00:38:32,640 --> 00:38:34,640
Are you mad at me?
Hmm let me see your face.

605
00:38:35,930 --> 00:38:37,960
- Tell me.
- Hey the bus is here.

606
00:38:39,960 --> 00:38:43,000
- What are you mad at me about?
- I'm not. Mad about what?

607
00:38:44,620 --> 00:38:45,920
Cake I'm hurt.

608
00:38:45,920 --> 00:38:47,920
See. You're mad.

609
00:38:48,290 --> 00:38:49,920
Why are you mad?
Tell me.

610
00:38:50,080 --> 00:38:51,920
"School's Agricultural Farm"

611
00:39:00,440 --> 00:39:02,340
I knew you're here.

612
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,340
Hey!
How long have you been here, Fee?

613
00:39:04,930 --> 00:39:07,920
I just got here.

614
00:39:15,090 --> 00:39:16,850
- What's wrong Eiw?
- Hmm?

615
00:39:21,140 --> 00:39:23,840
Fee.
Have you ever felt you're so important.

616
00:39:23,840 --> 00:39:25,840
but one day you're not anymore?

617
00:39:29,980 --> 00:39:32,600
You mean you're less important?

618
00:39:32,730 --> 00:39:34,600
Yeah. Something like that.

619
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,250
Umm. Maybe.

620
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:41,210
I have a sibling.

621
00:39:41,210 --> 00:39:43,210
There're a certain period where I feel...

622
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:45,210
My mom only focused
on my younger sibling more.

623
00:39:45,740 --> 00:39:48,170
It's like I used to be someone
she only cares about.

624
00:39:48,170 --> 00:39:50,170
But one day, you have to share
with someone.

625
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:53,080
But to be honest, I think...

626
00:39:53,080 --> 00:39:55,080
You're not less important.

627
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,440
It's just that mom has more responsibility.

628
00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:01,000
We're grown ups.
We can't be unreasonable.

629
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:08,120
- See-Eiw!!
- Ha?

630
00:40:08,120 --> 00:40:10,120
I'm kidding.

631
00:40:10,120 --> 00:40:12,120
Why do you ask?

632
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,120
What's wrong?

633
00:40:15,060 --> 00:40:16,940
No. Just asking.

634
00:40:16,940 --> 00:40:18,940
You're sure?

635
00:40:19,420 --> 00:40:20,940
Um.

636
00:40:22,140 --> 00:40:23,380
I'm sure.

637
00:40:23,770 --> 00:40:25,380
Lets' go.
Go back to the table.

638
00:40:25,380 --> 00:40:27,380
- The bell is about to ring.
- Ok.

639
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:29,380
Let's just put the watering pot away.

640
00:40:29,380 --> 00:40:31,380
- Come on.
- Um.

641
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:35,540
Get up. Eiw.
Let's go.

642
00:40:39,210 --> 00:40:41,980
- See-Eiw. Come on.
- Ok.

643
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,960
Ready. Set.

644
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:57,960
Go!

645
00:41:04,440 --> 00:41:06,860
Next.
See-Eiw. Toffee.

646
00:41:06,860 --> 00:41:08,860
And Peak.

647
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,180
Ready Eiw?

648
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,500
Ready.

649
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,500
Set.

650
00:41:18,690 --> 00:41:19,690
Go!

651
00:41:23,240 --> 00:41:24,530
Hey.

652
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:29,560
Hey. Don't gather around.
Get someone from the infirmary.

653
00:41:30,420 --> 00:41:31,940
Hey you guys got any inhaler?

654
00:41:32,260 --> 00:41:33,940
I didn't bring any.

655
00:41:33,940 --> 00:41:35,940
- I also don't have it.
- Are they here yet?

656
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,210
Don't gather around.
Go get some one from the infirmary now.

657
00:41:40,480 --> 00:41:42,210
Are you ok Eiw?

658
00:41:48,930 --> 00:41:50,290
Are you gonna play game?

659
00:41:50,290 --> 00:41:52,290
No. I'm on MSN.
I'm gonna talk with Rin.

660
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,220
If you don't care about me,
I will go home.

661
00:41:56,220 --> 00:41:58,220
I already asked Rin
to be online.

662
00:41:58,220 --> 00:42:00,220
Why are you fighting with him?

663
00:42:01,300 --> 00:42:03,440
Me and Eiw never have
personal space.

664
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:05,440
