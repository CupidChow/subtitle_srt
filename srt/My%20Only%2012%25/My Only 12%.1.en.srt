1
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:18,040
"Mama's Dim Sum"

2
00:00:34,810 --> 00:00:38,000
A long time ago, I accidentally read an article...

3
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,750
from Hom's magazine.
(Hom = his sister)

4
00:00:42,270 --> 00:00:44,670
The article was about...

5
00:00:44,670 --> 00:00:47,800
The possibility that you could
be successful with your first love.

6
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,380
Details about it?
I already forgot all of it.

7
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:57,750
But the one thing that
I can remember exactly is...

8
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,530
...the number '12%'.

9
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,200
Mom!

10
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:13,800
I told you not to run down the stairs.

11
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,660
Good morning.

12
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,400
I made Banana with Sticky Rice.
Bring some for Cake too, ok?

13
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:24,440
Sure!
Thank you.

14
00:01:25,550 --> 00:01:26,980
Looks so good!

15
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,320
- I'm gonna get goin' then
- Yes.

16
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:30,720
Bye, Mom!

17
00:01:31,220 --> 00:01:32,759
- Ride safe.
- Yess!

18
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:40,000
Morning aunty Proud.

19
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,289
Oh! Hey! Eiw.
You're here.

20
00:01:41,289 --> 00:01:44,500
I tried to wake Cake up for so many times.
He doesn't move a bit.

21
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,550
Please go wake him.

22
00:01:45,550 --> 00:01:47,000
Sure.
Leave it to me. No worries.

23
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,640
Then May I go up and wake him then?

24
00:01:49,640 --> 00:01:52,640
Um. Bring these sandwiches up too.
I made for you guys.

25
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:53,200
Thank you.

26
00:01:53,250 --> 00:01:53,900
For me...

27
00:01:53,900 --> 00:01:59,400
12% is such a small and kinda halfway number.
It's frustrating.

28
00:01:59,580 --> 00:02:00,920
Cake!

29
00:02:01,420 --> 00:02:05,540
Cake!

30
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,479
Cake! Cake! Cake! Cake!

31
00:02:22,940 --> 00:02:23,520
Cake.

32
00:02:24,850 --> 00:02:28,880
Cake. Cake. Cake. Wake up!
It's 6 something already.

33
00:02:28,880 --> 00:02:32,300
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:36,900
Wake up already!. Wake up!
Ow! That hurts.

35
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:39,900
Why did you have to
poke my forehead?

36
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:43,950
Just wake up.
Get up now!

37
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:46,300
Cake. Wake up.

38
00:02:48,079 --> 00:02:51,220
If you don't wake up now,

39
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,560
I will go to school by myself!

40
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:59,900
Yess. Taking the bus alone,
you'll end up got squeezed anyway.

41
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,800
Let me shower real quick.

42
00:03:02,650 --> 00:03:04,340
Good!
Get up, Cake.

43
00:03:04,370 --> 00:03:06,140
- Can I...
- No more!

44
00:03:06,520 --> 00:03:09,290
- A bit more sleep.
- No more sleeping, Cake!

45
00:03:09,300 --> 00:03:10,640
Just a bit more.

46
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,220
So heavy.
You are so difficult to wake up. Just wake up.

47
00:03:15,490 --> 00:03:17,240
Have you eaten anything?

48
00:03:17,250 --> 00:03:19,260
My mom made Banana
with Sticky Rice for you.

49
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:21,640
And aunty Proud made us sandwiches.

50
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,300
I would love to have Nana with Sticky Rice.

51
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:26,000
I brought 2 for you.
Is it enough?

52
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:27,820
What about you, Eiw?

53
00:03:27,820 --> 00:03:29,410
1 is enough for me.

54
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:32,000
Just 1 again?

55
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,200
- Have some sandwiches too.
- I know.

56
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,200
Just go shower.
Hurry up. We're late.

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:38,240
Skinny like this...

58
00:03:38,240 --> 00:03:42,000
I know. I don't wanna be squeezed
with other people on the bus.

59
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:43,400
Hurry back.

60
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,000
But there's a high chance...

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,350
because I've heard a lot that...

62
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:03,500
first love...

63
00:04:04,600 --> 00:04:07,100
usually ends up to be unrequited love.

64
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:09,700
Are you full?

65
00:05:09,970 --> 00:05:12,260
Um. I am full.

66
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:14,690
Hey Cake.
This bag is all for you.

67
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:15,050
Um.

68
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:16,700
And these sandwiches too.

69
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,250
I will have sandwiches first then.

70
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:21,770
Held the Sticky Rice for me for sec.

71
00:05:23,480 --> 00:05:25,720
You'll choke.

72
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:28,760
Let's go.
We'll be late.

73
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,380
Wait Cake!

74
00:05:30,380 --> 00:05:33,820
You shirt is hanging out.
Why don't you tuck it in nicely?

75
00:05:33,820 --> 00:05:35,820
You look like a gangster,
you know that?

76
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:37,420
I will tuck it in at the school.

77
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:40,930
You always break the school rules.
Aunty Proud will scold at you again.

78
00:05:40,930 --> 00:05:44,100
Then you should not scold at me too.
Just my mom is enough.

79
00:05:44,100 --> 00:05:46,100
What about your homework?

80
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:48,100
There's Math due this morning.

81
00:05:49,170 --> 00:05:50,740
A face like that...

82
00:05:50,740 --> 00:05:53,180
No!. I'm not letting you copying
my homework anymore.

83
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:56,180
- Please. Please.
- No. No more.

84
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,659
Nope. Nope.

85
00:05:58,659 --> 00:05:59,790
You're always like this, Cake.

86
00:05:59,790 --> 00:06:02,340
I reminded you yesterday's evening
to do it.

87
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:04,340
You read all the comics and didn't do it.
I can't help you.

88
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,870
- Stop complaining.
- Ow!

89
00:06:05,870 --> 00:06:07,870
Why did you have to push my head?

90
00:06:07,870 --> 00:06:11,020
- Be careful! You'll fall from the stairs.
- Cake! Don't bully him.

91
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:12,380
You deserve that!

92
00:06:13,020 --> 00:06:16,400
Little Eiw. His name is little Eiw.
Ow!

93
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:17,400
Not little Eiw.

94
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:19,100
- Hurt!
- I'm not your little brother, Cake!

95
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,650
- Go to school already.
- Mom look!

96
00:06:21,650 --> 00:06:23,650
Look. He hit me.

97
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,650
He started first.

98
00:06:25,650 --> 00:06:27,650
Hurry to school please.
You guy'll be late.

99
00:06:27,650 --> 00:06:29,650
Ok. I'll get going then.
Bye.

100
00:06:29,650 --> 00:06:30,650
Good bye, aunty.

101
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,380
Little Eiw!

102
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,460
I'm not!

103
00:06:38,460 --> 00:06:40,460
These two never change.

104
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:47,600
Wow Cake.

105
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,600
That bite was already half of it.

106
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:50,970
Why didn't you just eat the whole thing?

107
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:53,260
- Look at you. All messy.
- Bla Bla Bla.

108
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,100
Something on my mouth? Clean it for me.

109
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,410
The bus is here. Go.

110
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,840
Cake!

111
00:07:19,700 --> 00:07:22,000
Cake. You're sweating.

112
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,300
It's so hot.
There're so many people on the bus.

113
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:30,320
There're some tissues in the small pocket.
Take it.

114
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,200
Sure.

115
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:35,380
Found it?

116
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:36,540
Wait.

117
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:38,080
Got it.

118
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,580
Wipe the sweat.

119
00:07:41,570 --> 00:07:43,400
Look at your face.
Lots of sweat.

120
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,450
Wait, Cake.

121
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,130
Huh?

122
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:51,680
What did you clean your hands
with after eating?

123
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,020
Oh! With your backpack.

124
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:55,500
Hey!

125
00:07:55,550 --> 00:07:57,400
How could you do that?

126
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:59,050
It's fine.
Just very little.

127
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:01,400
- Does it stain?
- My hands are clean. It's fine.

128
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,660
No. Don't come too close.
Don't touch me.

129
00:08:08,810 --> 00:08:12,420
Balance yourself.
If you can't, just lean on me.

130
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,170
I'm okay.

131
00:08:14,970 --> 00:08:16,530
Suuure.

132
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:18,610
If you fall,
don't blame me.

133
00:08:18,610 --> 00:08:21,320
It's you who might fall
because of talking too much.

134
00:08:21,330 --> 00:08:24,500
If you fell down,
that would serve you right!

135
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:30,660
- Are you mad?
- No, I'm not.

136
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:32,900
- You're so dirty.
- You're mad.

137
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:46,980
You are acting like a child, Cake!

138
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:51,440
You are so grown up much?

139
00:08:52,650 --> 00:08:54,290
- Old.
- Babbling.

140
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,440
So old. Aunty Eiw.

141
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:06,280
Why are you not tucking your shirt in?

142
00:09:06,830 --> 00:09:07,850
See you...

143
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,230
See you at the line up.
I will go in from the other side.

144
00:09:11,240 --> 00:09:13,130
Get away from Ms.Sunee again?

145
00:09:13,130 --> 00:09:14,230
I'm not.

146
00:09:16,230 --> 00:09:18,230
I just don't wanna see her.
That's all.

147
00:09:18,230 --> 00:09:19,810
Of course.
You don't wanna see her.

148
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,300
You break all the rules.

149
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:23,230
How can you wanna see her?

150
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:25,230
There're a lot of rules.

151
00:09:25,240 --> 00:09:27,030
If I obey the rules,
I will be bored to death.

152
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:28,090
What are you gonna do
if I die?

153
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,080
There's me!.
I can obey.

154
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,340
And I'm not bored to death.

155
00:09:32,350 --> 00:09:33,910
Long pants are not cool.

156
00:09:33,910 --> 00:09:35,300
So does the socks.

157
00:09:35,980 --> 00:09:37,290
I don't like it.

158
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,480
I don't like it.

159
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:39,630
Um.

160
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,730
- Don't forget to swipe the card as well
- Yess.

161
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,930
I told you yesterday and you still forgot.
- Yess.

162
00:09:44,940 --> 00:09:46,510
Stop mocking me.

163
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:48,630
See you at the line up. Go!

164
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,810
- See you.
- Sure.

165
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:50,980
Don't forget ok?

166
00:09:50,990 --> 00:09:51,430
Yes!

167
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:14,230
- Hey!
- What the hell?

168
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:17,130
You've arrived...Sweetieee?

169
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:19,230
Sweetie my ass!

170
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:21,040
So aggressive.

171
00:10:22,730 --> 00:10:24,500
Hey! Is that the new girl?

172
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,730
You know that Peak can't date anyone
more than a week.

173
00:10:30,930 --> 00:10:32,680
Hey! Did you finish Math homework?

174
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:34,130
I have not.

175
00:10:34,230 --> 00:10:35,730
Could we finish
it's due first period?

176
00:10:35,740 --> 00:10:39,550
We could!
You know that teachers talk a lot anyway.

177
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,230
We'd probably finished copying,
sleeping, and

178
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,230
we might still be down here
listening to them.

179
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,680
- They do talk very long.
- Right.

180
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,960
Who're you gonna copy
the homework from?

181
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:51,930
I already have a target.
The nerd.

182
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:54,230
But I will ask him
when they call for the line up.

183
00:10:54,230 --> 00:10:55,820
Wanna join me?

184
00:10:55,830 --> 00:10:58,230
I can't.
The teacher on my line is very strict.

185
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,230
If she caught me copying,
I'll be dead.

186
00:11:01,760 --> 00:11:04,300
So...would you be able to find someone
before the class?

187
00:11:06,920 --> 00:11:08,060
No!

188
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,980
I said what I said.
I don't take my words back.

189
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,630
Eiwwww!

190
00:11:13,030 --> 00:11:14,950
Please let me copy.

191
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:17,190
Line up will start soon.

192
00:11:17,690 --> 00:11:20,650
If you don't let me copy now,
I won't finish before the class.

193
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,630
You wanna see me
got punished?

194
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:27,130
Cake! If you'd done it since last night,
you wouldn't be punished today.

195
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:29,830
It's already in the past.

196
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:32,260
You want me to ride
the time-machine back?

197
00:11:32,500 --> 00:11:34,200
You've got the Doraemon's drawer?

198
00:11:34,210 --> 00:11:34,980
Not funny.

199
00:11:34,990 --> 00:11:36,390
I didn't want it to be funny.

200
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,230
I just want your Math homework.
That's all.

201
00:11:39,430 --> 00:11:42,880
When I finish, I will hand it in to
the head for you.

202
00:11:52,930 --> 00:11:54,400
Please.

203
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,230
Please. Please.

204
00:11:57,230 --> 00:11:58,830
- Cake.
- Please!

205
00:11:59,030 --> 00:12:01,430
- Don't use that voice.
- Please. Please. Please.

206
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,950
If I let you copy my homework,

207
00:12:02,950 --> 00:12:06,000
you'll get used to it
and never do it by yourself.

208
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,430
Next time,
I will do it myself okay?

209
00:12:10,650 --> 00:12:13,410
Today, when we go home,
I will go do it with you.

210
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:26,080
Um.

211
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:29,760
Hand it in for me too.
Don't for get!

212
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,610
Yess.

213
00:12:42,690 --> 00:12:43,640
Cake.

214
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:45,030
Hmm?

215
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:46,230
You can go.

216
00:12:47,770 --> 00:12:49,250
You're telling me to go away?

217
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,130
Don't you feel lonely,
sitting here alone?

218
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:53,790
Nope.
Fee and Kung will be here shortly.

219
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:55,420
You can go please.

220
00:12:55,420 --> 00:12:57,000
They're not here yet.

221
00:12:57,890 --> 00:12:59,360
I wanna sit here with you.

222
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:08,330
I was comfortable sitting here alone.

223
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:11,080
I make you uncomfortable?

224
00:13:11,080 --> 00:13:14,610
Being with you,
attracts others' attention.

225
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:16,260
I don't like it.

226
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,220
You should go.

227
00:13:22,200 --> 00:13:24,400
Fine. I will go then.

228
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:25,230
Um.

229
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:26,680
Ok.

230
00:13:26,730 --> 00:13:27,730
Don't forget to hand it in.

231
00:13:27,730 --> 00:13:29,450
Sure!
I'm borrowing your pen ok?

232
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:31,130
Please don't lose it.

233
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:33,820
I won't.

234
00:13:33,830 --> 00:13:35,410
Don't lose it.

235
00:13:43,170 --> 00:13:51,980
(National anthem)

236
00:13:59,860 --> 00:14:02,530
Ugh. So hot out.

237
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:04,130
You want some tissues, Kung?

238
00:14:04,960 --> 00:14:05,530
Huh?

239
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:07,850
Probably too late.

240
00:14:08,040 --> 00:14:08,880
It's ok.

241
00:14:10,460 --> 00:14:12,980
Eiw/Kung.
Did you finish your Math homework?

242
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:16,560
The guys behind told me we have to hand it in
before going up to the classroom.

243
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:18,440
I finished since the teacher assigned.

244
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:19,230
Wow.

245
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:22,040
What about you, Eiw?

246
00:14:22,930 --> 00:14:26,200
Um. I already finished mine but...

247
00:14:26,200 --> 00:14:27,430
it's with Cake.

248
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:35,680
That dude is very good at copying.

249
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,170
Hey!
I think it's a little weird.

250
00:14:39,740 --> 00:14:41,740
You guys grew up together...

251
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,560
...but when you come to school.

252
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:45,640
you act like complete strangers.

253
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,640
Yeah.

254
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:49,130
Really?

255
00:14:49,130 --> 00:14:51,500
- It's actually not that strange.
- Hmm?

256
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:55,770
We can be close, but doesn't have
to be together all the time.

257
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:57,370
You're not used to this, Kung?

258
00:14:57,370 --> 00:15:00,290
Eiw has never been a people person.

259
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:05,420
So hot.

260
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:18,060
Cake's world is pretty chaotic.

261
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:20,590
I can't be around him that much.

262
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:25,320
My house is next to his.

263
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,800
Our family is pretty close to each other.

264
00:15:27,800 --> 00:15:31,210
When I was born,
Cake is already there waiting for me.

265
00:15:33,090 --> 00:15:34,730
We grew up together.

266
00:15:34,730 --> 00:15:38,140
We learned how to walk together.
Bath together.

267
00:15:38,360 --> 00:15:40,140
Having meals together.

268
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,460
And also taking care for one another.

269
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,510
Cake! Cake!

270
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:51,720
I'm goin' in, Cake!

271
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:54,510
Cake. Cake. Cake.
Wake up. Wake up. Wake up.

272
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,510
You'll be late again.

273
00:15:56,510 --> 00:15:58,510
See. You're sleeping still.

274
00:15:59,290 --> 00:16:00,390
Cake. Cake. Cake.

275
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:02,390
We go to school together.

276
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,650
We're together so much.
It feels like he is my world and mine becomes his.

277
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:18,270
But when I grew up a little more,

278
00:16:18,270 --> 00:16:21,960
I just realized that the world is way bigger than that.

279
00:16:22,290 --> 00:16:23,930
- Where would you like to sit?
- Up to you, Cake.

280
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:25,190
- You wanna sit over there?
- Hey! Cake!

281
00:16:25,190 --> 00:16:27,290
- Haven't seen you for so long.
- True.

282
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:29,530
- What are you having?
- Mama (Instant noodle brand)

283
00:16:29,530 --> 00:16:31,750
When we're at home just the two of us,

284
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:33,750
is way different from...

285
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:37,080
when we're outside of the house.

286
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:40,940
We grew up together,
so whenever we talk or do something...

287
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:43,060
it seems normal just like
when we're at home.

288
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:44,300
Here let me open for you.

289
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:45,670
But I just realized that...

290
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:48,150
Hey!
My hands are wet.

291
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:49,240
Dry for me too.

292
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:52,220
I can't open the lid,
can you do it for me too?

293
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:54,220
Other people don't see it
the same way we do.

294
00:16:54,700 --> 00:16:56,550
- Wimpy my ass!
- Cake!

295
00:16:56,550 --> 00:16:57,550
It's fine.

296
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:59,550
He's so upset.

297
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:07,530
What the fuck is wrong with you?

298
00:17:07,530 --> 00:17:10,119
It's better off...if we're not together...

299
00:17:10,119 --> 00:17:12,119
...outside of our world.

300
00:17:26,770 --> 00:17:29,170
"Buddhism"

301
00:18:06,200 --> 00:18:08,160
Ugh. So hungry.

302
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,890
Oh...

303
00:18:11,690 --> 00:18:14,570
So many people.
Would there be any seats left for us?

304
00:18:14,570 --> 00:18:16,050
Yeah.

305
00:18:16,060 --> 00:18:17,490
What should we do?

306
00:18:17,500 --> 00:18:20,020
Or should we go have some breads
from the school mart?

307
00:18:20,040 --> 00:18:21,760
School mart then.

308
00:18:21,770 --> 00:18:24,420
Looks like we're not
gonna get the seats anytime soon.

309
00:18:25,050 --> 00:18:27,590
I will go buy some drinks.
I want cantaloup smoothie.

310
00:18:27,590 --> 00:18:30,550
Ew. You're having that cheesy color drink again?

311
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,550
You're not bored of them?

312
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:35,380
Fee. You always drink Chamomile also.
Not sick of it yet?

313
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:39,610
Eiw! Do not compare Chamomile
with cheesy color drinks of yours, could you?

314
00:18:39,610 --> 00:18:41,160
Please!

315
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:42,520
It's not that bad.

316
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:44,520
Both of you just stop.

317
00:18:45,670 --> 00:18:48,220
Eiw! Where's your table?

318
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:50,630
Err...

319
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:53,300
I'm going to buy some breads
from the school mart.

320
00:18:53,850 --> 00:18:55,160
Why don't you have a proper meal?

321
00:18:55,160 --> 00:18:57,050
There's no seats left for us.

322
00:18:57,050 --> 00:18:59,530
All the tables are reserved.

323
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:06,170
Sit here.

324
00:19:07,830 --> 00:19:10,310
Good!

325
00:19:10,310 --> 00:19:12,310
I can see how useful you are today.

326
00:19:12,310 --> 00:19:14,170
I've been waiting for you to invite us.

327
00:19:14,170 --> 00:19:15,480
Come. Eiw. Kung.

328
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:17,480
I want to have some suki.

329
00:19:17,690 --> 00:19:20,230
Come on.
You don't have to sit next to each other.

330
00:19:22,230 --> 00:19:23,380
Then let me sit at the end.

331
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:25,380
Um. Go.

332
00:19:25,850 --> 00:19:27,880
Come on. Eiw. Kung.

333
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:28,880
Um.

334
00:19:31,320 --> 00:19:32,680
Let's go buy some lunch.

335
00:19:32,680 --> 00:19:34,680
Let's go.

336
00:19:34,680 --> 00:19:36,710
Reserve the table for me yeah? Let's go.

337
00:19:36,710 --> 00:19:38,650
Stand by here ok?

338
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,100
Ok I will.

339
00:19:49,420 --> 00:19:50,980
Hi sir.

340
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:53,190
- A glass of Ovaltine please.
- Ovaltine yes?

341
00:20:00,970 --> 00:20:02,150
Thank you.

342
00:20:03,210 --> 00:20:04,460
What would you like kid?

343
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:06,460
Can I have a cantaloupe smoothie please?

344
00:20:06,460 --> 00:20:08,460
You order the same thing everyday.

345
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:11,580
Drink the same thing.

346
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,580
You scared me Cake!

347
00:20:14,410 --> 00:20:15,670
Did you buy your lunch?

348
00:20:15,670 --> 00:20:17,100
Um. I did.

349
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
I have Kung put it on the table
for me already.

350
00:20:20,250 --> 00:20:22,440
Uncle, can I have coco
with lots of boba please?

351
00:20:22,440 --> 00:20:24,680
Sure.
Please wait a moment.

352
00:20:28,940 --> 00:20:30,520
You're looking me like
you're about to scold at me.

353
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,980
Nothing. Just looking.

354
00:20:33,800 --> 00:20:37,580
I'm not gonna scold you myself.
I will have aunty Proud do it.

355
00:20:37,580 --> 00:20:39,580
Hey!
What is it about?

356
00:20:39,580 --> 00:20:42,600
You haven't studied at all.
Been sleeping all day.

357
00:20:43,160 --> 00:20:44,500
Look at the schedule.

358
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,210
Why?

359
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,860
Social Science and Buddhism?
Who can stay awake?

360
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,860
- Cake. We're here to study. Not fooling around.
- Cake.

361
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,860
- Yes?
- Would you like to have this?

362
00:20:52,490 --> 00:20:53,860
Sure. Why not?

363
00:20:54,320 --> 00:20:56,330
But I already bought mine.

364
00:20:56,330 --> 00:20:57,590
- Oh really?
- You want it?

365
00:20:57,590 --> 00:20:59,110
- Yes.
- You want it?

366
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,110
Where's your table?

367
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:06,050
- Hey! You've got many friends there.
- Yeah.

368
00:21:07,060 --> 00:21:08,430
What's your next period?

369
00:21:24,890 --> 00:21:26,380
I never understand like at all.

370
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:29,330
Why do you have to take the bus
at this stop?

371
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,300
Previous stop, there'd be some seats left,
but this one there'd be none.

372
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:37,860
That stop has too many people, Fee.

373
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,930
You can't really fix
this introvert thingy huh?

374
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:46,770
Do I have to fix it?
I think it's fine.

375
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:50,580
Don't you think it'll be better,
if you can change yourself a bit?

376
00:21:50,580 --> 00:21:52,490
How can you walk here everyday?

377
00:21:52,490 --> 00:21:54,310
Oh! Cake.

378
00:21:54,760 --> 00:21:56,310
How come you're here today?

379
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,540
My mom wants me to go home early.

380
00:21:58,540 --> 00:22:01,180
So I walked out with Eiw
and been waiting for you with him.

381
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,020
Is it good?

382
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,880
And why does it has
to be that messy?

383
00:22:05,890 --> 00:22:07,210
Cake!

384
00:22:13,230 --> 00:22:14,740
Let's go!
The bus is here.

385
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,230
- See ya
- See you, Fee.

386
00:22:16,230 --> 00:22:18,310
- Bye bye, Eiw.
- Bye.

387
00:22:25,630 --> 00:22:28,730
Hey Fee!
What are you doing here?

388
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:31,010
Um. I just split from
Cake and Eiw just now.

389
00:22:31,010 --> 00:22:33,540
I'm about to go home.
Are you going too?

390
00:22:33,540 --> 00:22:35,600
Yeah. Wanna tag along?

391
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,920
- Sure.
- Let's go.

392
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,560
- Come on, Fee.
- Go. Let's go.

393
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,940
Fee.
What the hell are you doing?

394
00:22:45,940 --> 00:22:47,330
You have the sauce
all over your mouth.

395
00:22:47,330 --> 00:22:48,450
Why?

396
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:50,450
You're such a pig.

397
00:22:50,800 --> 00:22:52,450
Clean it for me please.

398
00:22:53,010 --> 00:22:55,060
Ew. No.

399
00:22:55,620 --> 00:22:56,610
Just go!

400
00:22:56,610 --> 00:22:58,150
You're so dirty.

401
00:22:58,150 --> 00:22:59,060
Go.

402
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:01,250
Do you wanna clean it first?
So embarrassing.

403
00:23:01,250 --> 00:23:03,840
Ugh. Is my shirt stained?

404
00:23:06,690 --> 00:23:07,630
- Eiw!
- Hmm?

405
00:23:07,630 --> 00:23:09,630
Do you wanna go to Uncle O's?
Let's go get some toys?

406
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,350
Really? Go go.

407
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:12,670
I wanna have some wood candy.

408
00:23:12,670 --> 00:23:14,670
You have it too often,
your mom will complain.

409
00:23:14,670 --> 00:23:16,670
Even you can have ice cream!

410
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,670
Why?
Grape flavor. So good.

411
00:23:18,670 --> 00:23:20,270
Wood candy is better.

412
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,270
A bit chewy and crunchy.

413
00:23:23,380 --> 00:23:24,930
I'm not gonna argue with you any longer.
Let's go.

414
00:23:24,930 --> 00:23:26,930
Where are we going?
Cake You'll trip.

415
00:23:32,640 --> 00:23:33,880
Come on.

416
00:23:35,410 --> 00:23:37,300
Here. Put the coin here.

417
00:23:38,830 --> 00:23:40,030
What would you like?

418
00:23:42,050 --> 00:23:43,340
An eraser?

419
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:45,340
No.

420
00:23:48,650 --> 00:23:50,250
Blowing balloons.

421
00:23:50,250 --> 00:23:52,250
I would love to play that really.

422
00:23:52,750 --> 00:23:54,250
Are we gonna get it?

423
00:23:54,250 --> 00:23:56,250
Go go.

424
00:23:57,790 --> 00:23:58,920
Cake!

425
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:01,630
Stop teasing!

426
00:24:01,630 --> 00:24:02,810
Uncle O, I'm thirsty.

427
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,810
Ugh!
Stop teasing me, Cake.

428
00:24:04,810 --> 00:24:05,810
Ok. Ok.

429
00:24:08,840 --> 00:24:10,920
Please get the blowing balloons.

430
00:24:13,690 --> 00:24:15,130
Here it comes.

431
00:24:17,370 --> 00:24:18,380
Come on.

432
00:24:20,430 --> 00:24:21,790
What did you get?

433
00:24:23,130 --> 00:24:26,200
Come on Cake!
Why're you hiding it?

434
00:24:26,230 --> 00:24:28,040
What did you get?
An eraser?

435
00:24:28,720 --> 00:24:30,040
Tissue?

436
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:32,770
What is it?

437
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:33,780
It's no.2.

438
00:24:34,680 --> 00:24:36,880
We've got blowing balloons!

439
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:38,880
Uncle!

440
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:39,880
Ugh.

441
00:24:42,340 --> 00:24:43,920
I wanted to tease him.

442
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:45,920
Cake.
You're so mean.

443
00:24:46,550 --> 00:24:48,320
I'm gonna go buy some snacks.

444
00:24:49,080 --> 00:24:51,240
This is not fun anymore, Uncle.

445
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:55,920
- You owe me some snacks uncle
- Sure. Sure.

446
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,220
Haha.

447
00:25:01,920 --> 00:25:03,120
Thank you.

448
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:09,280
I'm home, mom.

449
00:25:09,280 --> 00:25:10,580
Hi.

450
00:25:12,340 --> 00:25:14,020
Hey mom.

451
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:16,100
Pao and Hom are not home yet? (Pao = his brother)

452
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,680
Not yet.

453
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:20,020
You should go up
and get changed.

454
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:23,160
I made some noodle.
It's in the kitchen.

455
00:25:23,160 --> 00:25:24,800
When you're done,
come down and eat.

456
00:25:26,250 --> 00:25:28,130
I will eat it later mom.

457
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:32,680
Oh. Actually I'm going to
Nakhonpathom tomorrow.

458
00:25:32,680 --> 00:25:35,240
I'm gonna pay grandma a visit.
She's not well.

459
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:37,640
Not well?
What's wrong with her?

460
00:25:38,120 --> 00:25:42,160
She doesn't stop coughing and
refused to go see the doctor.

461
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:44,480
I have to go force her to see doc.

462
00:25:45,410 --> 00:25:48,120
I wanna see grandma too.

463
00:25:48,920 --> 00:25:52,080
You have school.
Let's just go see her over the weekends

464
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:54,530
Let me take her to the doctor first.

465
00:25:56,220 --> 00:25:57,560
Fine.

466
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,880
When will you be back?

467
00:26:00,160 --> 00:26:02,440
I might stay there for 2-3 days.

468
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,440
Be with her a bit.

469
00:26:06,040 --> 00:26:08,360
I already talked to Proud.

470
00:26:08,840 --> 00:26:11,280
You can sleep over with Cake.

471
00:26:12,560 --> 00:26:15,120
What about Pao and Hom?

472
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:17,760
Pao will drive for me.

473
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:21,640
Hom is at her friend's dorm.
She said there're lots of projects lately.

474
00:26:21,640 --> 00:26:23,640
Probably won't be home a lot.

475
00:26:23,640 --> 00:26:27,520
Oh mom.
I'll be lonely for sure.

476
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:29,720
Don't say it.

477
00:26:29,720 --> 00:26:34,280
You used to sleepover at Cake's all the time.
Never come home and complain that you're lonely.

478
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:36,400
Mom!

479
00:26:38,400 --> 00:26:40,800
What time are you going to leave tomorrow?

480
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:43,560
Probably after you leave for school.

481
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,960
Mom!

482
00:26:45,960 --> 00:26:48,680
So I won't see anybody
when I come back home then?

483
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:50,680
Go stay with Cake.

484
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:55,000
All your clothes and stuff,
I will leave it with Proud.

485
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:58,170
If you want anything else,
just let me know in the morning.

486
00:26:58,180 --> 00:27:00,230
I will prepare for you.

487
00:27:00,230 --> 00:27:02,230
Ok? Go.

488
00:27:02,230 --> 00:27:04,230
- Sure.
- Go get change.

489
00:27:04,230 --> 00:27:05,230
Sure mom.

490
00:27:05,460 --> 00:27:07,830
Get the crumbs
off your face too son.

491
00:27:09,730 --> 00:27:12,740
I know that you ate something.
Brush your teeth really well too.

492
00:27:14,620 --> 00:27:18,700
I better go put my stuff away
and change then.

493
00:27:19,780 --> 00:27:20,440
Oh!

494
00:27:44,850 --> 00:27:46,290
I'm sleepy already.

495
00:27:47,370 --> 00:27:48,520
What?

496
00:27:49,650 --> 00:27:50,960
Cake!

497
00:27:52,260 --> 00:27:55,650
This is the last question already.
Just do it.

498
00:27:56,290 --> 00:27:58,010
I'm sleepy.

499
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:00,210
No you can't.
Come on.

500
00:28:00,210 --> 00:28:02,930
If you concentrate,
you can finish within a min.

501
00:28:03,890 --> 00:28:05,650
Please.
You can do it.

502
00:28:06,770 --> 00:28:09,890
- No. I'm sleepy.
- Cake!

503
00:28:10,210 --> 00:28:12,450
Come do this one.

504
00:28:12,450 --> 00:28:14,450
- Just a bit more and we're done.
- Let me copy please.

505
00:28:14,450 --> 00:28:17,480
See!
If it's only a bit more, then let me copy.

506
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:19,120
You're such a negotiator.

507
00:28:19,140 --> 00:28:20,440
Just do it.

508
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:22,300
Don't use my mom's words.

509
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,660
It's true.

510
00:28:25,610 --> 00:28:27,280
Just do it.

511
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:41,460
- You put the coin in the piggy bank everyday.
- Um.

512
00:28:41,460 --> 00:28:43,180
It's a saving, Cake.

513
00:28:43,180 --> 00:28:48,020
Pao said that if I have money
left from the pocket money, I should save it.

514
00:28:48,020 --> 00:28:50,020
You should do it too.

515
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:53,780
I don't have any left.
That's the thing.

516
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:57,380
If you eat less,
you will have more to save.

517
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:00,780
Do your homework.

518
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,780
No. I'm sleepy already.

519
00:29:02,780 --> 00:29:04,780
Cake. Get up.

520
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:07,340
- Please. Let me copy.
- Get up!

521
00:29:09,740 --> 00:29:12,340
Mark my word,
If I let you copy...

522
00:29:12,340 --> 00:29:15,420
you'll be wide awake
and read comics again.

523
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:18,140
Try me.

524
00:29:18,140 --> 00:29:20,300
I guarantee you...

525
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:23,100
After I finish copying,
I will be asleep the moment my head touches the pillow.

526
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,100
No I don't believe you.

527
00:29:26,540 --> 00:29:28,620
Please.

528
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:32,700
Do not beg me.

529
00:29:32,700 --> 00:29:35,540
Please. Please.

530
00:29:36,780 --> 00:29:38,080
- Please. Please.
- Stop.

531
00:29:38,960 --> 00:29:39,940
Please. Please.

532
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:42,660
You're acting like a fool.

533
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:44,780
Here. Ok. Ok.

534
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:48,820
Yes. Woo hoo!

535
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:52,220
So cute.

536
00:29:52,220 --> 00:29:54,220
Just do your homework.

537
00:30:05,940 --> 00:30:07,940
Why are you laughing?

538
00:30:07,940 --> 00:30:09,940
I'm not.

539
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:12,540
Leave me alone sweetie.
Just do it!

540
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:14,660
Don't call me like my friends do.

541
00:30:14,660 --> 00:30:16,140
That hurts.

542
00:30:16,140 --> 00:30:17,660
Here!

543
00:30:17,660 --> 00:30:19,660
Sweetie. Sweetie.

544
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:22,700
Sweetie. It's cute,
don't you think?

545
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:23,900
Sweetie.

546
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:25,620
Seasoning.
(Eiw came from See-Eiw means soy sauce in Thai)

547
00:30:25,620 --> 00:30:26,740
- Cake!
- Seasoning.

548
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:28,060
- Holding a grudge much?
- Seasoning.

549
00:30:28,060 --> 00:30:30,580
- You're so mean.
- Do you like it seasoning?

550
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:34,500
Sweetie just do it.
Come on.

551
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:38,420
- Leave me alone, seasoning.
- Just do it.

552
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:41,180
- Leave me alone, seasoning.
- Come on.

553
00:30:41,210 --> 00:30:42,460
"Proud's Bakery" "Mama's Dim Sum"

554
00:30:43,090 --> 00:30:44,330
Done.

555
00:30:44,340 --> 00:30:46,290
Copying so fast.

556
00:30:46,300 --> 00:30:48,920
I don't care.
It's done.

557
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:53,400
See. If you let me copy in the first place,
we would be done long ago.

558
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:56,200
If you do it yourself,
just a bit longer and it could done too.

559
00:30:57,490 --> 00:31:01,880
- I'll keep it for you, ok? Cause you might forget it.
- Ok. Go go.

560
00:31:03,160 --> 00:31:06,130
Don't sleep like that.
Get up.

561
00:31:06,130 --> 00:31:09,880
You'll snore.
I can't sleep, Cake.

562
00:31:15,920 --> 00:31:17,800
See.

563
00:31:21,400 --> 00:31:24,360
What's wrong with you? Epilepsy?

564
00:31:25,880 --> 00:31:28,000
Just go to sleep.

565
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,000
Good night.

566
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:35,040
I wanna bite you. Here.

567
00:31:35,040 --> 00:31:37,040
Stop.

568
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:47,160
Ok. I give up. Give up.

569
00:32:10,440 --> 00:32:12,140
"Mama's Dim Sum"

570
00:33:12,400 --> 00:33:14,040
Cake.

571
00:33:15,800 --> 00:33:19,760
Cake. Ow! Stop.

572
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:21,760
Let me go. We'll be late.

573
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:25,080
Your voice.

574
00:33:30,000 --> 00:33:31,840
You voice is so loud.

575
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:34,640
Sleepy head.

576
00:33:34,640 --> 00:33:37,320
You went to bed early last night,
why are you sleepy now?

577
00:33:37,320 --> 00:33:39,840
Early? We were doing homework.

578
00:33:39,840 --> 00:33:41,400
Stop it.

579
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,040
You can read 10 comic books at a time.

580
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,040
A bit of homework shouldn't hurt you.

581
00:33:46,040 --> 00:33:48,040
Ugh. Stop complaining.

582
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,040
Cake!

583
00:33:50,040 --> 00:33:52,640
Cake get up.
Go home and shower.

584
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:54,640
I'll shower too.

585
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:57,920
You go shower first.
I will sleep for 10 more mins.

586
00:33:57,920 --> 00:33:59,920
Wake me up when you're done.

587
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,920
Get up. Get up!

588
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:06,120
Nope. Get up now.
You'll be late.

589
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:07,490
No we won't.

590
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,080
I will brush my teeth and just go.

591
00:34:10,610 --> 00:34:11,900
Ew.

592
00:34:11,900 --> 00:34:13,969
Oww.

593
00:34:13,969 --> 00:34:17,960
Dirty. Don't touch me today.

594
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:21,880
How can I be dirty?
Just no shower for a day only.

595
00:34:21,880 --> 00:34:25,960
Did you know that dirtiness
does not come from sweat only, Cake?

596
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:30,960
Then your bed is dirty then?

597
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:34,000
Do not talk bad about my bed.
Mom just changed my bed sheet.

598
00:34:34,719 --> 00:34:35,840
Ok.

599
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,199
Clean. Continue sleeping.

600
00:34:37,199 --> 00:34:39,520
No. Get up, Cake!

601
00:34:39,520 --> 00:34:42,560
Wake me up when you're done.
I will go change at my place.

602
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:45,000
The hardest to wake up.

603
00:34:45,580 --> 00:34:47,540
Lazy as a pig.

604
00:34:47,580 --> 00:34:48,520
What?

605
00:34:48,620 --> 00:34:50,560
Lazy person.

606
00:34:50,560 --> 00:34:52,639
I can be more lazy than this.

607
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,600
I will bring all my school uniforms here.

608
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:57,720
You're already occupied
half of my closet.

609
00:34:57,740 --> 00:34:59,420
Bla bla bla.

610
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:02,800
I'm gonna go shower.

611
00:35:02,820 --> 00:35:04,920
- Go!
- After I shower, you'll need to be wide awake.

612
00:35:05,360 --> 00:35:07,200
So difficult to wake.

613
00:35:20,690 --> 00:35:23,560
I actually think you need to do some activities.

614
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:25,160
What kind of activities?

615
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:27,960
Oh. There're so many school activities.

616
00:35:28,570 --> 00:35:30,690
No. I don't wanna do it.

617
00:35:31,010 --> 00:35:33,020
Why not?
So you can have new friends.

618
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:36,320
No. I don't think that's necessary.

619
00:35:37,320 --> 00:35:39,040
It's good that you can
have new friends.

620
00:35:39,040 --> 00:35:41,800
I've got Fee, Kung, and you already.

621
00:35:41,800 --> 00:35:43,800
You're gonna have only those
3 your whole life?

622
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:47,920
I've got my mom, Pao and Hom too.

623
00:35:47,920 --> 00:35:49,920
No. I didn't mean that way.

624
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:53,040
Those are your family.
Not friends.

625
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:55,040
- Really?
- You know that right?

626
00:35:55,040 --> 00:35:57,040
Never mind.
I'm gonna get on the bus.

627
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:59,040
Hey! Cake wait up!

628
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:01,040
- No.
- Wait for me.

629
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:09,200
Oh! You can meet lots of new friends
from clubs actually.

630
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,720
Both senior and junior class.
Have you chosen your club?

631
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:14,560
I have.

632
00:36:14,560 --> 00:36:16,080
I'm thinking of Library club.

633
00:36:16,080 --> 00:36:18,080
Huh? Library club?

634
00:36:18,080 --> 00:36:19,080
Um.

635
00:36:19,680 --> 00:36:22,040
Hey! There're many more
fun clubs than that.

636
00:36:22,040 --> 00:36:24,040
Why Library club?

637
00:36:24,040 --> 00:36:26,040
Acting Club.

638
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,640
Cooking club is also interesting.

639
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:30,640
Don't you like it?
Why Library?

640
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:35,440
No. I like quietness.
I don't like chaos.

641
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,440
Library club is perfect.

642
00:36:38,640 --> 00:36:41,240
What about Kung and Fee?
Which club are they joining?

643
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,240
Kung joins Computer club.

644
00:36:43,240 --> 00:36:45,240
I think Fee is joining Drama club.

645
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:47,600
Drama sounds fun.

646
00:36:47,600 --> 00:36:49,600
You wanna try joining Fee's?

647
00:36:49,600 --> 00:36:51,600
Or you wanna join basketball with me?

648
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,600
No.

649
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:56,240
I don't even talk to you that much at school.

650
00:36:56,240 --> 00:36:57,680
No.

651
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:00,040
- Why're you saying like this again?
- Ugh.

652
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:02,040
That hurts.

653
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,960
You need to talk to other people too,
you know that right?

654
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:08,400
You cannot just only talk to Cake,
Fee, and Kung.

655
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:11,360
It's okay.

656
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,520
I've got you.
I don't need any other people anymore.

657
00:37:13,520 --> 00:37:15,760
You're saying all this
but at school you never talk to me.

658
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,640
But I have you
when I go home...That's enough.

659
00:37:19,040 --> 00:37:21,520
Are you going to stay home
your whole life?

660
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:23,520
Hmm.

661
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,680
I know Cake.

662
00:37:26,320 --> 00:37:28,560
You don't know.

663
00:37:28,560 --> 00:37:30,560
I know.

664
00:37:32,440 --> 00:37:33,560
Peak.

665
00:37:58,320 --> 00:37:59,680
Good.

666
00:38:09,040 --> 00:38:10,680
Peak.

667
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,200
Hey guys.
I'm gonna go.

668
00:38:14,580 --> 00:38:18,680
Where are you going?
Where is he going?

669
00:38:28,080 --> 00:38:30,120
New girl again?

670
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:32,440
He's so wild.

671
00:38:32,880 --> 00:38:34,440
Can't help it.
Your friend is so hot.

672
00:38:35,320 --> 00:38:37,240
Hold it in dude.

673
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:39,800
Why did you stop talking
to the previous girl?

674
00:38:39,800 --> 00:38:41,800
- Was kinda good, wasn't it?
- Yeah.

675
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:43,800
I talked to her for awhile
and it doesn't feel right.

676
00:38:44,040 --> 00:38:45,120
Waste of time.

677
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:47,120
Doesn't feel right?

678
00:38:47,120 --> 00:38:50,400
- Waste of time?
More like you wasted our time to comfort you?
- Nauseous.

679
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:53,720
Are you saying that you're hot enough
to have options?

680
00:38:53,720 --> 00:38:55,040
Hmm?

681
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:57,040
I'm so proud of my friend.

682
00:38:57,040 --> 00:38:59,040
Oh my friend/So hot.

683
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:02,040
Fuck you.
Stop minding other people's business.

684
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:04,040
I haven't done anything.

685
00:39:04,640 --> 00:39:06,720
Oh hey!
You're leaving?

686
00:39:08,320 --> 00:39:10,400
He slapped my head.
Should we just get back with him?

687
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,760
1 2 3.

688
00:39:12,760 --> 00:39:17,720
Take care of my friend, Cherry.

689
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:25,640
Cherry. Cherry. Cherry. Cherry. Cherry. Cherry.

690
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,640
Ended up got sick.

691
00:39:31,650 --> 00:39:33,740
I don't wanna be at home alone.

692
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:35,580
I'll be here with you.

693
00:39:35,600 --> 00:39:37,540
Eat this first.

694
00:39:39,290 --> 00:39:42,130
Told you to take the meds first,
then follows with water.

695
00:39:42,250 --> 00:39:43,680
Wanna hug?

696
00:39:48,080 --> 00:39:49,500
Who're you talking to, Cake?

697
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:51,330
I'm talking to Rin.

698
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:56,960
Fee. Have you ever felt so important to someone,
but one day you're not anymore?

699
00:39:56,980 --> 00:39:58,370
Has Eiw stopped
being uncomfortable around us?

700
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:03,080
Even Cake who lives next door,
he still never talks to at school.
