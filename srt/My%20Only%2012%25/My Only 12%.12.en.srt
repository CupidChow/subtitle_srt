1
00:00:00,460 --> 00:00:02,520
I’m not important anymore, right?

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,530
When you said ‘Only Cake is enough'
is no longer true either yeah?

3
00:00:11,630 --> 00:00:13,760
You disappoint me by saying that.

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:18,800
If you think that way,

5
00:00:20,830 --> 00:00:22,750
then you’re not Cake
that I used to know either.

6
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,030
I don’t wanna talk to you anymore.

7
00:00:32,360 --> 00:00:34,410
Can you stop saying that?

8
00:00:41,240 --> 00:00:42,910
It’s you who needs to stop.

9
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:46,410
You always say things
I don’t wanna hear.

10
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:50,890
Today is the first time that I play, Cake!

11
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:55,610
It was gonna be the first time
you'd get to see me play.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:59,580
It’s the first time!

13
00:00:59,580 --> 00:01:01,760
Do you know how long
I have waited?

14
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:04,239
Do you have any idea?

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,740
Have you ever been the one who waits?

16
00:01:10,490 --> 00:01:13,500
You don’t understand how I feel.

17
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:18,640
Look at what you've been doing to me.

18
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:23,120
What do you want?

19
00:01:24,220 --> 00:01:27,020
Look at what you've been doing
since the play is over.

20
00:01:27,870 --> 00:01:30,650
You haven’t even congratulated me.

21
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:34,620
Not a single compliment.

22
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:36,810
Not even a smile.

23
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,170
How do you expect me to feel?

24
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:43,450
I’m sorry.

25
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:54,440
You don’t respect my feeling at all.

26
00:01:55,630 --> 00:01:58,110
It’s you who is not enough
with only me.

27
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:02,570
You always have people around you.

28
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,260
Lots of people to be around.

29
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,680
You also liked someone else.

30
00:02:08,680 --> 00:02:10,860
Hung out with other people for so long.

31
00:02:11,770 --> 00:02:13,960
But I’ve never liked anyone.

32
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,970
I’ve been waiting for you only.

33
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:21,770
Have you ever realized that?

34
00:02:26,650 --> 00:02:29,280
I’ve been waiting for you for so long.

35
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,300
Back then…

36
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:36,570
I didn’t wanna share you with Rin either,

37
00:02:36,570 --> 00:02:38,829
but I never said anything.

38
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,829
And you’re still like this.

39
00:02:46,970 --> 00:02:49,400
What kind of right do you have
to do this to me?

40
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:51,440
Are you blind?

41
00:02:56,780 --> 00:03:00,120
Why do you have to make me say all these?

42
00:03:02,360 --> 00:03:06,350
If what I've been feeling is true,
then please stop seeing me.

43
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:09,160
You hate me, right?

44
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,090
Cause I’m like this.
I’m gay like this.

45
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:19,920
You should stop being friend with me, Cake.

46
00:03:24,220 --> 00:03:25,230
I’m sorry.

47
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,640
I’m so sorry.

48
00:03:38,030 --> 00:03:40,670
I never knew that you feel that way with me.

49
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:46,240
But I don’t wanna be your friend anymore.

50
00:04:16,250 --> 00:04:17,579
Will you be my boyfriend?

51
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,820
Eiw…

52
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,220
Don’t stay quiet like this.

53
00:04:39,980 --> 00:04:41,800
I don’t like this vibes.

54
00:04:42,510 --> 00:04:43,290
Well…

55
00:04:44,650 --> 00:04:45,440
Well...

56
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:49,020
I didn’t think I could be your boyfriend.

57
00:05:52,640 --> 00:05:54,010
Well...

58
00:05:55,710 --> 00:05:58,140
I didn’t think I could be your boyfriend.

59
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:01,160
I just...

60
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:05,710
love you like I've always been loving.

61
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:15,100
I love you too.

62
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,770
I care about you.

63
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,480
Don’t want other people to be with you.

64
00:06:24,460 --> 00:06:25,960
I don’t know, Cake.

65
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,950
You knowing that I love you
is more than enough.

66
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:45,070
Do you love me?

67
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,080
I do.

68
00:06:55,870 --> 00:06:57,980
Why do you ask?

69
00:06:57,980 --> 00:06:59,950
If you love me,
then don’t think too much.

70
00:07:03,560 --> 00:07:05,180
Just say yes to me.

71
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:10,840
You like women.

72
00:07:12,090 --> 00:07:13,290
So?

73
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:16,670
Well...

74
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:22,400
I am gay, but you are not.

75
00:07:26,190 --> 00:07:28,440
Why do you think you’re gay?

76
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,940
I like boys,
then that would make me gay.

77
00:07:36,890 --> 00:07:38,490
I like you.

78
00:07:47,260 --> 00:07:48,840
Then I will be gay with you.

79
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:53,870
Because I love you so much.

80
00:08:01,790 --> 00:08:04,030
A love like this
is not gonna have a happy ending.

81
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:08,990
Why do you think that way?

82
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:11,550
People are not gonna be happy for us.

83
00:08:11,820 --> 00:08:14,110
My mom is not gonna like this.

84
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,520
Also aunty Proud.

85
00:08:16,520 --> 00:08:18,700
Uncle Thanet must be mad for sure.

86
00:08:19,450 --> 00:08:22,240
-What about Cream…
-We just love each other, Eiw.

87
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,680
Nobody's hurt just
because we love each other.

88
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,000
I love you.

89
00:08:31,770 --> 00:08:33,360
Wanna take care of you,

90
00:08:34,780 --> 00:08:37,720
and spend time together forever.

91
00:08:48,330 --> 00:08:50,810
I actually don’t have to say those things

92
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:54,080
because we've been like that already.

93
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,480
But it's better to make it clear.

94
00:09:11,290 --> 00:09:12,960
If you love me then...

95
00:09:13,770 --> 00:09:16,030
you have to let me love you
like this forever, ok?

96
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:31,150
Huh? I cannot hear you.

97
00:09:31,150 --> 00:09:32,540
What did you say?

98
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,450
You are my everything.

99
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,620
You're not answering my question.

100
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,240
I will be everything for you too.

101
00:10:01,690 --> 00:10:03,450
Then I am your boyfriend then?

102
00:10:41,940 --> 00:10:43,680
I love you.

103
00:10:45,540 --> 00:10:47,320
I love so you the most.

104
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:51,260
I love you the most too.

105
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:58,460
Go take a shower please.
It’s getting late.

106
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,840
Fine.

107
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:04,500
I’m going.

108
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,080
Cake!

109
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:11,340
Why?

110
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:14,040
Even we're a couple,
you have to ask first anyway.

111
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:17,900
You’re not nice at all.
You’re taking advantage of me.

112
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:19,900
Go take a shower.

113
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:22,000
Well...

114
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:24,840
One more please.

115
00:11:25,720 --> 00:11:27,620
Can I kiss you one more time?

116
00:11:27,940 --> 00:11:29,860
Please.

117
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:33,020
Don’t negotiate. Just go take a shower.

118
00:11:33,020 --> 00:11:37,580
Tomorrow you have to wake up and read me the cons of alcoholic drinks, until I am satisfied, ok?

119
00:11:37,580 --> 00:11:39,580
-Understood?
-Ughhhhh.

120
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:41,520
I just drank a little.

121
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:44,640
It was not just a little.

122
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,900
Go.

123
00:11:52,080 --> 00:11:54,780
You haven’t showered too.

124
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,780
You go take a a shower first.

125
00:11:59,360 --> 00:12:01,640
Go so we can go to bed.

126
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,540
I just showered before picking you up.

127
00:12:04,540 --> 00:12:06,980
No you have to shower again.

128
00:12:06,980 --> 00:12:08,760
Fine. Fine.

129
00:12:08,760 --> 00:12:11,700
If not, hundreds of bacteria
will get into your wounds.

130
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,640
Don’t copy my sentence.

131
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,420
Go sit and wait.

132
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:16,880
Ok ok.

133
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,660
Did I wake you up?

134
00:13:12,580 --> 00:13:15,480
Why did you wash your hair this late?

135
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,780
Go blow dry your hair.

136
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,800
You cannot sleep like this.
You might get ringworm on the scalp.

137
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:24,640
I will go dry and come to bed.

138
00:13:25,980 --> 00:13:27,500
You can go back to sleep.

139
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,760
I will come hug you in a bit.

140
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,760
Go blow dry real quick.

141
00:13:42,540 --> 00:13:44,540
Let go of my shirt,
if you want me to go.

142
00:13:50,480 --> 00:13:53,740
I guess I'll sleep with wet hair then.
I'm cool with that.

143
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:58,500
Wanna come hug me?

144
00:13:59,960 --> 00:14:00,880
Here.

145
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:21,540
Eiw, look at those guys.

146
00:14:21,540 --> 00:14:23,120
Leave them alone.

147
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:28,380
What are you guys doing?

148
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,860
Just sit.

149
00:14:31,860 --> 00:14:33,280
Why?

150
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:38,360
Read Cake. Read all of this.

151
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:40,900
Read every single letter please.

152
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:44,880
Eiw...

153
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,680
Focus Cake!

154
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:51,860
Stop goofing.

155
00:14:51,860 --> 00:14:55,220
Read might not be enough probably?
He should memorize it.

156
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:57,080
You guys stop talking.

157
00:14:57,080 --> 00:14:59,080
Just stay quiet.

158
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:01,200
Why?

159
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,940
Just read, Cake.

160
00:15:03,780 --> 00:15:05,320
Fine.

161
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:10,780
Alcohol is a substance that can be addictive,
has both pros and cons

162
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:14,840
When you drink, it’s going to affect
central nervous system.

163
00:15:14,840 --> 00:15:18,520
Side effect of drinking can range from
mild to severe level.

164
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:22,020
such as dizziness and imbalance.

165
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:23,620
slurred speech.

166
00:15:23,620 --> 00:15:25,400
And the more serious one is...

167
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:30,780
Do I really have to read it?

168
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:37,560
You wanna read it like this now
or you want to memorize like Fee said?

169
00:15:39,320 --> 00:15:40,540
Fine, I'll read.

170
00:15:43,060 --> 00:15:47,200
The side effect of drinking alcohol
to organs in your body.

171
00:15:47,200 --> 00:15:51,000
For health, it is the main cause of death.

172
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,000
There are both
short and long term effects.

173
00:15:54,380 --> 00:15:57,420
If you drink continuously for a long time,

174
00:15:57,420 --> 00:16:00,220
it would affect the memory system.

175
00:16:00,220 --> 00:16:03,940
nervous, blood, and blood pressure system.

176
00:16:03,940 --> 00:16:07,460
It could also directly affect the liver.

177
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,720
Eiw...your eyes are so red.

178
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,040
I'm fine.
Just read every single page that I give you.

179
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:23,660
No. You almost cry.

180
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:26,040
Don't pay attention to me.
Just read, Cake.

181
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:27,180
No.

182
00:16:27,180 --> 00:16:29,420
You will drink more if you don't read.

183
00:16:35,280 --> 00:16:36,920
No I won't.

184
00:16:38,360 --> 00:16:40,380
Even I don't read this, I won't drink anymore.

185
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:45,160
I promise.

186
00:16:48,760 --> 00:16:51,240
If you cannot do it,
then don't promise.

187
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:57,160
When did I ever lie to you?

188
00:17:06,220 --> 00:17:08,520
I care about you.
You know that right?

189
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:11,520
I want you to be healthy and strong.

190
00:17:12,060 --> 00:17:13,619
I know.

191
00:17:15,099 --> 00:17:16,980
So we can be together for a long time.

192
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,599
Where can I possibly go?

193
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:23,819
I'm not gonna drink anymore.

194
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,420
Okay?

195
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:36,300
Fee and Kung are still here!

196
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:39,480
So?
There's nothing wrong about that.

197
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:50,540
If they don't wanna see,

198
00:17:50,540 --> 00:17:52,180
just close their eyes.

199
00:17:55,360 --> 00:17:57,840
We'll just go home.

200
00:17:57,840 --> 00:17:59,660
Right, Fee?

201
00:17:59,660 --> 00:18:02,460
See you tomorrow. Good luck.

202
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,940
Where were you?

203
00:18:08,140 --> 00:18:09,440
I'm not gonna read anymore.

204
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:16,600
I'm gonna let you two go
for now.

205
00:18:16,600 --> 00:18:19,540
But tomorrow you have to
tell me everything, okay?

206
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:21,240
Get home safely.

207
00:18:23,380 --> 00:18:24,920
Bye bye.

208
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:29,300
Stop smiling!

209
00:18:29,300 --> 00:18:29,660
Huh?

210
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,300
Fee and Kung were there,
why did you have to kiss me?

211
00:18:32,300 --> 00:18:33,760
Why not?

212
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,860
I could kiss you at the dorm, why not here?

213
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:37,620
Still not used to it?

214
00:18:37,620 --> 00:18:40,840
That's the dorm,
but this is a public place.

215
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:46,560
You did kiss me on the cheek
in the middle of the road before.

216
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,020
When?

217
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:50,240
When was it?

218
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:54,120
Umm when was that?

219
00:18:55,360 --> 00:18:56,420
When?

220
00:18:56,420 --> 00:18:58,600
Before I left to America.

221
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,300
Ughh don't count that one.

222
00:19:00,300 --> 00:19:02,180
How?
You're such a cheater.

223
00:19:02,180 --> 00:19:04,700
That's a good bye kiss.
I don't count.

224
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:09,420
But now it's a boyfriend kiss.
Why can't I do it?

225
00:19:13,580 --> 00:19:15,700
Enough reading. Just go read at the dorm.

226
00:19:15,700 --> 00:19:17,700
Back to the dorm.

227
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,700
No!

228
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:25,140
Hey...

229
00:19:25,140 --> 00:19:28,720
Why are we at your dorm?
I wanted to go home.

230
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,020
You don't like kissing in public right?

231
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:34,280
Hm? And how is that
relevant to my question?

232
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:36,340
I brought you here to continue the kiss.

233
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:43,000
Cake.

234
00:19:46,520 --> 00:19:48,060
Cake.

235
00:19:53,040 --> 00:19:55,340
Hey Cake.

236
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,480
What are you gonna do
If I really trip over?

237
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,100
-You're not gonna trip.
- You're not careful.

238
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:01,760
Cause I'm here with you.

239
00:20:13,100 --> 00:20:14,920
I'm going crazy.

240
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,240
Huh?

241
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:17,880
I'm going crazy.

242
00:20:19,900 --> 00:20:22,220
I wanna have the whole body of yours.

243
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:25,160
Wanna bite.

244
00:20:26,280 --> 00:20:27,480
Bite here.

245
00:20:30,680 --> 00:20:31,620
Cake.

246
00:20:33,580 --> 00:20:34,520
Cake.

247
00:20:37,260 --> 00:20:39,180
Don't know what to speak?
Are you blushing?

248
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:40,560
No, I'm not.

249
00:20:40,560 --> 00:20:42,560
You're blushing?

250
00:20:42,840 --> 00:20:45,240
You're avoiding my eye contact.

251
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,800
You are.

252
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:50,500
Hey Cake!

253
00:20:50,500 --> 00:20:52,500
I was not aware.

254
00:20:57,020 --> 00:20:58,820
Cake enough!

255
00:20:58,820 --> 00:21:01,000
Cake it's tickling.

256
00:21:01,000 --> 00:21:02,940
Your stubs are poking me.

257
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,440
Is it that itchy?

258
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:06,080
-That much?
- Yeah.

259
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:10,560
-You're such...
-Itchy. Itchy?

260
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:01,520
Fee : I'm waiting for the tea.

261
00:22:01,960 --> 00:22:03,860
Long Pao : ...

262
00:22:10,680 --> 00:22:13,600
Sis Hom : Here comes the day.

263
00:22:22,980 --> 00:22:25,480
Cake.

264
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,280
Cake.

265
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:29,900
Hmm?

266
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:31,900
What have you done on Facebook?

267
00:22:33,680 --> 00:22:36,320
Oh I set the relationship status.

268
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:39,580
And when did you take my phone?
How come I didn't know?

269
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,940
If you knew,
how is it supposed to call sneaking?

270
00:22:44,060 --> 00:22:46,740
Why did you do this?
You're such a jerk.

271
00:22:53,280 --> 00:22:54,720
Are you okay?

272
00:22:58,140 --> 00:23:00,340
Don't you think people
will talk bad about this?

273
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,940
Your friends also.

274
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:06,640
Don't think too much.

275
00:23:07,160 --> 00:23:09,200
If they're gonna talk,
they'd probably talk long ago.

276
00:23:21,140 --> 00:23:23,020
Don't overthink.

277
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:26,640
There're so many gays in the US.

278
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:28,960
It's totally normal over there.

279
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:31,500
Even my parents never said it's bad.

280
00:23:32,580 --> 00:23:34,240
Love is love.

281
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,060
One more thing,

282
00:23:39,060 --> 00:23:41,360
I want people to know
that you're dating me.

283
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,940
So there's nobody
trying to involve with you.

284
00:23:44,860 --> 00:23:46,960
There's no one trying to do that.

285
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:49,860
There are a lot.

286
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:52,460
Tal is one of them.

287
00:23:52,460 --> 00:23:54,280
He's just a senior from the club.

288
00:23:54,280 --> 00:23:56,000
He's been flirting with you.

289
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:58,760
I can tell. Can't you tell?

290
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,080
I...can.

291
00:24:02,820 --> 00:24:06,940
See! You knew but you still forbade me
from accompanying you.

292
00:24:06,940 --> 00:24:09,040
- You also went home with him.
- That hurts.

293
00:24:09,040 --> 00:24:11,040
Stop smiling.

294
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:16,040
You had lots of assignments.
I didn't want to trouble you.

295
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:26,460
If I didn't go with you,
I would be in trouble more.

296
00:24:27,160 --> 00:24:29,320
How can I let you hang out
with other guys alone?

297
00:24:29,320 --> 00:24:31,500
Especially when
he tries to flirt with you.

298
00:24:32,980 --> 00:24:35,440
I already told him that he can't date me.

299
00:24:36,200 --> 00:24:38,680
Did you tell him that you love me?

300
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:43,660
How could I tell him?

301
00:24:45,020 --> 00:24:47,220
Then you're not secured yet.

302
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:50,960
Wait for him to like the status first,
then I'll feel more secured.

303
00:24:53,720 --> 00:24:56,320
Don't smile.
Makes me wanna squeeze you.

304
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:00,520
Wanna squeeze me?

305
00:25:06,420 --> 00:25:08,400
I'm gonna go shower.

306
00:25:08,400 --> 00:25:09,040
Blushing?

307
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,340
- No, I'm not.
- Are you?

308
00:25:10,340 --> 00:25:13,100
Who's blushing? No, I'm not.
I better go.

309
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,000
You're so cute.

310
00:25:15,000 --> 00:25:16,240
- You're so cute.
- Wait!

311
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,120
- You're so cute.
- Not like this. It's tickling.

312
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:32,420
Wanna squeeze me huh?

313
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:35,940
Is he gonna come or what?

314
00:25:35,940 --> 00:25:37,960
When is he gonna show up?

315
00:25:38,900 --> 00:25:40,600
Where is he?

316
00:25:43,280 --> 00:25:45,140
Oh there he is!

317
00:25:46,000 --> 00:25:48,360
Hey what are you guys doing?

318
00:25:48,360 --> 00:25:49,700
Why that face?

319
00:25:49,700 --> 00:25:51,520
Finally showed up, sassy boy.

320
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:52,840
Huh?

321
00:25:52,840 --> 00:25:55,040
- Sassy what?
- Spill the tea please.

322
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:56,920
Fee, calm down.

323
00:25:57,720 --> 00:25:59,080
Help me, Kung.

324
00:25:59,080 --> 00:25:59,580
Eiw.

325
00:25:59,580 --> 00:26:00,760
Hmm?

326
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:02,760
How come
you and Cake are dating?

327
00:26:02,760 --> 00:26:03,720
Hey Kung!

328
00:26:03,720 --> 00:26:05,480
- Answer me!
- Ugh you guys!

329
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,800
Did you know about this, Noey?

330
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:09,900
No I don't know anything.
Tell us now, Eiw.

331
00:26:09,900 --> 00:26:11,940
Everything!

332
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:14,540
- There's nothing.
- Don't pretend to read now.

333
00:26:14,540 --> 00:26:16,120
- Come on.
- I wanna finish marketing work.

334
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,080
Could you please start?

335
00:26:18,080 --> 00:26:20,360
- There's nothing.
- Don't let us find out what did you guys do.

336
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:21,840
Huh?

337
00:26:21,840 --> 00:26:24,780
Oh Cake that's cold!

338
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:26,200
It is.

339
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,340
You startled me.

340
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,760
Why are you guys
looking at me like that?

341
00:26:32,360 --> 00:26:35,020
Why? I'm just bringing a drink
for my boyfriend.

342
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:38,640
I'll leave soon.

343
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,080
Do you wanna go?

344
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:41,400
Um.

345
00:26:41,400 --> 00:26:43,960
Yeah what we're seeing
already said it all.

346
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:49,140
Where have you been?
Hot right?. Sweat all over the face.

347
00:27:00,460 --> 00:27:02,020
Shall we go?

348
00:27:02,720 --> 00:27:03,740
I'm also thirsty.

349
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,660
Yeah.

350
00:27:18,340 --> 00:27:19,980
Why do you look grumpy?

351
00:27:25,040 --> 00:27:26,540
Why are you looking at me like that?

352
00:27:27,400 --> 00:27:29,280
Not this one.
Go change please.

353
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:31,020
Why not?

354
00:27:31,020 --> 00:27:33,740
I told you.
My friends are coming over tonight.

355
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,960
We are gonna work on the project together.

356
00:27:35,960 --> 00:27:37,680
And how is that relevant
to my pants?

357
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,840
This pair of pants is too short.

358
00:27:42,300 --> 00:27:44,260
But I'll go to sleep soon.

359
00:27:44,260 --> 00:27:46,640
My friends are coming.
Change it just in case.

360
00:27:46,640 --> 00:27:48,860
I'm not gonna go out of the room.

361
00:27:49,440 --> 00:27:50,720
I don't care.

362
00:27:51,080 --> 00:27:52,280
Hey.

363
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:53,680
Change now.

364
00:27:55,120 --> 00:27:55,980
Hey.

365
00:27:58,360 --> 00:27:59,380
This one.

366
00:28:00,780 --> 00:28:01,660
Fine.

367
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:04,780
This one really?

368
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,440
Yes good boy.
Go change.

369
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:10,980
Go go go.

370
00:28:29,940 --> 00:28:31,540
I'm done.
Is it okay now?

371
00:28:39,820 --> 00:28:42,480
I already changed.
Why are you grumpy still?

372
00:28:44,540 --> 00:28:46,500
Pu is also coming.

373
00:28:47,300 --> 00:28:49,340
Pu?
Which Pu?

374
00:28:50,060 --> 00:28:51,460
The one from my faculty.

375
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:53,660
Oh.

376
00:28:53,660 --> 00:28:55,300
You're not close with him?

377
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:57,480
Not like that.

378
00:28:58,800 --> 00:29:00,420
- It's just he likes you.
- Hmm?

379
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,560
Like me?

380
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:04,080
Yeah.

381
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:07,800
How?
We don't even know each other.

382
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,240
He can,
even you guys've never met.

383
00:29:14,500 --> 00:29:15,840
It should be fine right?

384
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:16,920
No, it shouldn't.

385
00:29:18,560 --> 00:29:20,340
Why?

386
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:22,980
He might just
like my physical appearance maybe?

387
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:24,980
It's not the same way
as us loving each other.

388
00:29:24,980 --> 00:29:26,980
Right?

389
00:29:29,620 --> 00:29:32,140
Right?

390
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:46,980
Yeah it's not the same as us.

391
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:53,580
I love you.

392
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:56,120
Like a lot.

393
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:02,940
Cake!

394
00:30:04,620 --> 00:30:06,220
Your friends are probably here.

395
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,640
I don't wanna work now.

396
00:30:13,480 --> 00:30:15,360
Don't be clingy.

397
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:18,020
Go! Your friends are waiting.

398
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:19,420
Fine, I'll go.

399
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,900
But first,

400
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,340
Hug me for one more minute.

401
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:34,700
Enjoy working with friends.

402
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,580
I'm so lazy to work.

403
00:30:37,420 --> 00:30:39,680
Wanna hug you longer.

404
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:41,940
When you finish,
you can hug as much as you want.

405
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:44,220
Okay?

406
00:30:44,220 --> 00:30:46,440
Fine. I'm gonna go.

407
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:48,980
You can sleep on your own?

408
00:30:48,980 --> 00:30:50,800
I can.

409
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:52,240
Okay.

410
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:52,780
I'll be back.

411
00:30:52,780 --> 00:30:54,380
Um.

412
00:30:54,380 --> 00:30:55,840
I'll be back.

413
00:30:56,840 --> 00:30:58,480
Enjoy working.

414
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:10,600
Hey why did you have to knock so loud?

415
00:31:10,600 --> 00:31:12,660
Ugh.

416
00:31:12,660 --> 00:31:13,820
I thought it was Eiw.

417
00:31:14,920 --> 00:31:16,200
Where is he?

418
00:31:17,320 --> 00:31:18,740
Read my mouth.

419
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,980
Nosy!

420
00:31:21,100 --> 00:31:23,340
What? I just wanna meet him.

421
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,420
- Yeah.
- Right dude?

422
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,660
Yeah I also wanna meet him.

423
00:31:28,260 --> 00:31:30,260
He's my boyfriend.

424
00:31:30,260 --> 00:31:31,860
Leave him alone.

425
00:31:35,340 --> 00:31:36,880
'My boyfriend'?

426
00:31:37,480 --> 00:31:39,640
He's so damn confident.

427
00:31:40,300 --> 00:31:41,440
Let's go in.

428
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:42,860
Leave us alone. Go!

429
00:31:42,860 --> 00:31:45,000
- Eiw?
- Are you here?

430
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:49,620
Are you here?
Where are you hiding, Eiw?

431
00:31:51,300 --> 00:31:52,800
I'm doomed.

432
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,860
Where is he?

433
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,000
Where's See-Eiw?

434
00:32:06,020 --> 00:32:08,320
In that room sleeping probably.

435
00:32:09,960 --> 00:32:12,400
He's asleep? Really?

436
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:14,940
Yeah so early.

437
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,500
Yeah.

438
00:32:16,500 --> 00:32:19,740
Even if he's not asleep yet,
I wouldn't let you guys meet him.

439
00:32:21,420 --> 00:32:22,680
What?

440
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:25,180
We don't get to meet him,
even we're sleeping over.

441
00:32:27,600 --> 00:32:30,700
Who are you? What kind of right do you have
to meet my boyfriend huh?

442
00:32:30,700 --> 00:32:34,500
Just work. You're here to work right?

443
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,600
And stay quiet.
Don't wake my boyfriend up.

444
00:32:39,240 --> 00:32:41,480
'My boyfriend'

445
00:32:41,480 --> 00:32:43,820
You're so obsessed with him.

446
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:47,540
The day you were drunk
You still called for his name sadly.

447
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,340
Another one.

448
00:32:54,920 --> 00:32:56,240
Mind your own business.
Scoot over.

449
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,460
I knew it.

450
00:32:57,460 --> 00:32:58,440
It's my business.

451
00:33:00,180 --> 00:33:02,380
Just work. Keep working.

452
00:33:04,920 --> 00:33:07,060
Let's do what he said.

453
00:33:07,060 --> 00:33:10,020
If we don't finish, he'll go crazy
when he doesn't get to hug his boyfriend.

454
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:16,520
I'm already heart broken before I even try.

455
00:33:19,540 --> 00:33:21,100
Mr. Pu.

456
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:23,100
you didn't go for it in the first place sir.

457
00:33:26,580 --> 00:33:30,240
Mr. Pu sir.
If you wanna date him,

458
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:32,620
you had to try since 20 years ago.

459
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:35,760
Work work.

460
00:33:35,760 --> 00:33:37,260
Work.

461
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,620
Yeah good. Just work.

462
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:46,240
I can't choose.

463
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,820
Naruto!

464
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:57,720
Why are you that surprised?

465
00:33:58,460 --> 00:34:01,480
We used to only read the comics
and watch it from the VCD.

466
00:34:01,480 --> 00:34:04,000
Didn't know that there's one on the app too.

467
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,000
Yeah there're everything on IQIYI.

468
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:07,840
There are lots of animations.

469
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:11,280
Also TV series.
I watched all from here when I was in America.

470
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:15,520
Oh that's so cool.

471
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:21,340
But my eyes are shutting down.

472
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:24,159
The work is not done.

473
00:34:25,770 --> 00:34:26,870
But can we go to sleep?

474
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:28,920
Um.

475
00:34:29,350 --> 00:34:31,969
Let's go to bed.
I've been waiting for you to say that.

476
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,440
Let's go guys.

477
00:34:38,469 --> 00:34:41,389
You guys are okay
sleeping here right?

478
00:34:41,780 --> 00:34:42,770
We're fine.

479
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:44,460
Yeah I guess.

480
00:34:44,460 --> 00:34:46,820
Good. I'm going to bed.

481
00:34:47,590 --> 00:34:49,210
- Good night.
- Good night friends.

482
00:34:49,210 --> 00:34:52,280
Oh and hug See-Eiw for me too please.

483
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:53,840
Me too.

484
00:34:53,840 --> 00:34:56,320
Shut up.
He's mine.

485
00:35:01,920 --> 00:35:03,440
Go!

486
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:05,110
Brush our teeth.

487
00:35:06,640 --> 00:35:08,800
Sleeping lonely in the coldness.

488
00:35:08,800 --> 00:35:10,720
- Cake, I'll borrow your toothbrush.
- Also no girlfriend.

489
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,010
He doesn't provide us blankets.

490
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,200
Why are you awake?
Am I waking you up by getting on the bed?

491
00:35:43,870 --> 00:35:46,520
No. I've just been sleeping fitfully.

492
00:35:48,120 --> 00:35:49,220
Why?

493
00:35:50,530 --> 00:35:51,380
Bad dreams?

494
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:54,840
Cause you were not here.

495
00:37:04,630 --> 00:37:06,930
I have something I want you to know.

496
00:37:10,250 --> 00:37:11,890
I love everything about you

497
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:17,040
I love your voice.

498
00:37:19,500 --> 00:37:21,100
I love your eyes.

499
00:37:29,360 --> 00:37:30,960
I love your ears.

500
00:37:39,040 --> 00:37:40,230
I love your nose.

501
00:37:46,970 --> 00:37:48,480
I love your mouth.

502
00:37:50,490 --> 00:37:51,950
I love your teeth.

503
00:37:58,650 --> 00:37:59,940
I love your body.

504
00:38:05,220 --> 00:38:06,800
I love your hands.

505
00:38:16,820 --> 00:38:18,180
I love when you talk.

506
00:38:20,570 --> 00:38:22,440
I love when you smile.

507
00:38:25,730 --> 00:38:27,440
I love when you laugh.

508
00:38:30,640 --> 00:38:32,260
I love when you're happy.

509
00:38:37,480 --> 00:38:39,870
I love the way you are.

510
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:32,200
I'm hurt.

511
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:33,760
What's the matter?

512
00:40:41,940 --> 00:40:44,540
I knew it.

513
00:40:45,780 --> 00:40:47,170
Did you prepare?

514
00:40:47,890 --> 00:40:48,500
Prepare what?

515
00:40:49,410 --> 00:40:50,700
Prepare to lick your wound.

516
00:40:52,530 --> 00:40:53,580
I'm heart broken man.

517
00:40:55,660 --> 00:40:59,000
Come on.
You'll eventually get over it.

518
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:05,290
You're talking too much.

519
00:41:05,290 --> 00:41:09,220
Ok Let's do it this way.
I'll lick your wound for you.

520
00:41:09,890 --> 00:41:11,920
For you...my friend.

521
00:41:35,940 --> 00:41:37,940
I already announce on Facbook.

522
00:41:37,940 --> 00:41:39,940
We should do it at uni too.

523
00:41:39,940 --> 00:41:41,530
When I like something,

524
00:41:41,530 --> 00:41:43,830
I can eat it for a long time and never got bored of it.

525
00:41:44,190 --> 00:41:45,530
I can even eat it ,y whole life.

526
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,530
So if you like me...

527
00:41:47,530 --> 00:41:49,530
That means you would eat me your whole life, wouldn't you?

528
00:41:52,300 --> 00:41:54,270
Can I spend a night with you tonight?

529
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,710
Mom. I'm home.

530
00:42:00,180 --> 00:42:00,980
