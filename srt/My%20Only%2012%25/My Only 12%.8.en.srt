1
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,040
Cake.

2
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,440
Why are you up so early?

3
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:18,520
I couldn't sleep.

4
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,000
Why?

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,000
You're all dressed up too.
That's unexpected.

6
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,320
You ran away from me
like that last night.

7
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:31,120
How could I sleep?

8
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:34,920
I told you I just wanna
think things through by myself.

9
00:00:35,640 --> 00:00:37,280
And...

10
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:41,520
how was it?
What did you realize?

11
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:48,760
Nothing.

12
00:00:59,200 --> 00:01:01,320
But I don't wanna think
about it anymore.

13
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,520
But...

14
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,400
Are you gonna leave right away?

15
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:07,400
After we finished 9th grade?

16
00:01:08,480 --> 00:01:11,160
Um.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:13,160
That's right.

18
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,039
Shall we go down for breakfast?

19
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:20,000
Since you got up so early.

20
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,000
Then we can go to school.

21
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:23,640
Let's go!

22
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:26,920
Are you mad at me, Eiw?

23
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,880
Why would I be?

24
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,800
You didn't do anything wrong.

25
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:44,400
If my family has to go...

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,920
I would also have to go too.

27
00:01:49,400 --> 00:01:51,320
Get up.

28
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:53,960
Let's go have breakfast.

29
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:56,720
See!
you already woke up so early,

30
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:59,240
we should go to school
early too, should we?

31
00:01:59,240 --> 00:02:01,600
Come on!

32
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:19,640
So...

33
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:22,480
I'm going in from the side entrance.

34
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:25,840
See you at the line up.

35
00:03:52,960 --> 00:03:55,320
Where're you goin'?

36
00:03:55,960 --> 00:04:00,040
I'm going with you.

37
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:03,200
With me? Why?

38
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:10,960
I just wanna spend time with you.

39
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:16,399
Well...

40
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:20,440
After we go in,
don't run away and avoid me, ok?

41
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,440
Um.

42
00:04:23,240 --> 00:04:28,040
I'm going to sit with you
in the class too.

43
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:28,880
Um.

44
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:31,600
We're gonna have lunch together
during the break.

45
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:35,240
And...

46
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:37,080
Today...

47
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:39,720
I'm going to study in the library
with you as well.

48
00:04:39,720 --> 00:04:44,040
Oh you're not going to
play football today?

49
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:46,400
I rather be with you.

50
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,840
I can wait for you by the field.

51
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,680
There'll be lots of people,
are you sure?

52
00:04:54,680 --> 00:04:58,880
Yeah I'm sure.
I can wait there.

53
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:01,840
You're gonna be comfortable?
Hm hm hm?

54
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:03,840
I'll be fine, Cake!

55
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:06,440
I would love to go.

56
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:10,120
Sure.
If you wanna go, then go.

57
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:12,640
Shall we go in?

58
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,120
Look at your hair.

59
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:16,360
It's fine.

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:19,120
Cake!

61
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,880
I think there'll be a storm today,

62
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,000
I think it'll even snow...

63
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,960
...or perhaps an earthquake?

64
00:05:32,640 --> 00:05:34,600
why is See-Eiw with Cake today?

65
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,520
I think Cake must have done something
to upset Eiw for sure.

66
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:39,720
So he has to make up for it.

67
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:43,600
Look at them.
So cute together.

68
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
Do you think it's a little odd?

69
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,720
How? They kinda grew up together,
didn't they?

70
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:50,280
They are not like you.

71
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:51,840
Pretend that you want to go to Cake's

72
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:53,520
but you actually wanna see Ton-hom!

73
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,600
How come you
turn to target me?

74
00:05:56,600 --> 00:05:58,880
Look at him.
He's full of shit.

75
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,680
Usually never bring any textbooks,

76
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:03,160
when he's with Eiw,
now he has books!

77
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:06,400
Why do you have to nag him?
It's good that he concentrates.

78
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,080
What about you guys?
When are you gonna concentrate?

79
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,520
Yeah when?

80
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,760
Nice chatting, huh you guys?

81
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:15,720
When did she come?

82
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,040
Can you figure out that question?

83
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:21,040
Yes ma'am.

84
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,840
You 're not gonna stop?

85
00:06:31,640 --> 00:06:34,000
Huh for real?

86
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:35,080
Yeah.

87
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:38,280
Why don't you tell me
when you're about to board on an airplane?

88
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:41,000
I completely forgot.
I tell you guys now is not so bad, right?

89
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,280
I'm okay.
I've been waiting for this moment for a long time.

90
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:45,280
Hahaha.

91
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:49,800
What was Rin's reaction?

92
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:52,720
Don't know.

93
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,960
What do you mean don't know?
How did you guys talk?

94
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:00,880
Don't know as in
I haven't told her.

95
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,760
Are you nuts?

96
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,880
She's your girlfriend!

97
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,240
So you haven't told her?

98
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,480
I'm kinda stressed lately.

99
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,640
If she finds out,
you're dead.

100
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:15,760
Yeah.

101
00:07:15,760 --> 00:07:18,160
When are you going to tell her?

102
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:22,880
I don't know.
I haven't seen her for awhile.

103
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:25,040
I couldn't do it
on the phone either.

104
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,800
But I think I'll tell her soon.

105
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:30,000
You mean haven't seen her like...
at all?

106
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:31,760
Yeah.

107
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:33,840
After school, I go straight home with Eiw.

108
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:35,680
You see me.

109
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:39,240
I think you should go talk to her
about this, don't you think?

110
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,320
It's not good leaving her no clue like this.

111
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:46,480
Fine I'll talk to her.

112
00:07:46,480 --> 00:07:49,159
Yeah make it clear.

113
00:07:49,159 --> 00:07:51,159
Don't put you hands all over me.

114
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,560
Isn't she gonna be
upset about this?

115
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:04,000
You disappear for so long.

116
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,960
Yeah normally you go see her
just a little late after school,

117
00:08:07,960 --> 00:08:09,960
she'd be mad already.

118
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,000
She is.

119
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,040
She sounded annoyed on the phone.

120
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:19,080
I wanna be with Eiw more.

121
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
It's so breezy
...makes me sleepy.

122
00:08:42,280 --> 00:08:46,800
What about the moving?
Are you ready mentally?

123
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:48,720
Nosy.

124
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:49,960
Shit head.

125
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:51,960
I asked you nicely.

126
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:58,040
To be honest, not really.

127
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,360
The closer to the day we fly,
the more I feel scared.

128
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:03,080
Yeah you sure are.

129
00:09:03,080 --> 00:09:06,280
You're moving to another country.
It's weird, if you're not.

130
00:09:06,280 --> 00:09:10,000
What about you?

131
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:13,000
You don't tell your friends of
what's happening anymore.

132
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,480
Don't you think I know
what's in your mind.

133
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,600
Ta doesn't know.

134
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:20,600
What do you expect from him?

135
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:22,280
He never know shit.

136
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:29,360
But really...you can tell me.

137
00:09:29,360 --> 00:09:32,680
Even though I know
what is it about anyway.

138
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:34,440
What?

139
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:37,040
You are so nosy too.

140
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:40,160
It's not obvious at all my friend.

141
00:09:41,160 --> 00:09:43,440
I don't really wanna know
to be honest.

142
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,480
Oh I'm going to you place today
by the way.

143
00:09:46,960 --> 00:09:48,680
Whatever.

144
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:50,840
If you wanna come,
just come.

145
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:53,160
- You can go wherever. You're a grown up.
-What are you babbling about?

146
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,600
If you nag me one more time,
I'm not gonna let you go.

147
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,880
Bow your head to me,
if you wanna go.

148
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:01,400
Why the hell would I do that?

149
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:04,680
I knew.

150
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:07,520
You secretly went to see Hom
on the show day.

151
00:10:07,520 --> 00:10:10,200
Right, you didn't tell your friends.

152
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:12,920
You're such a nosy person.

153
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,600
You are!

154
00:10:19,720 --> 00:10:21,760
Kick!

155
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,920
Peak concentrate!
We almost meet the boss of the game.

156
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,120
Eiw.

157
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:39,960
Are Pao and Hom home lately?

158
00:10:45,960 --> 00:10:48,080
They are.

159
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:49,840
Pao is home sometimes.

160
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:52,480
2-3 times a week.

161
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,360
But Hom is home
pretty much everyday.

162
00:10:56,360 --> 00:10:59,000
She gets home around
9pm usually.

163
00:11:05,480 --> 00:11:07,400
Is there anything
you want to know Peak?

164
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:11,520
No...just asking.

165
00:11:16,760 --> 00:11:18,200
Afraid of slipping out of your mouth?

166
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:20,280
Continue.
The boss. The boss!

167
00:11:20,280 --> 00:11:21,760
Ok.

168
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:37,960
Thank you for dropping me off.

169
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:38,920
-You're welcome.
-Drive safe.

170
00:11:38,920 --> 00:11:41,040
Ok. I'm gonna get going then.

171
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,040
Bye bye.

172
00:11:50,840 --> 00:11:53,200
Hey.

173
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,200
I have something to talk to you.

174
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,520
What's up?

175
00:11:59,520 --> 00:12:01,520
It's getting late.

176
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:07,080
I haven't seen you for a month.

177
00:12:07,080 --> 00:12:10,040
How are you doing?

178
00:12:11,280 --> 00:12:12,920
Um.

179
00:12:12,920 --> 00:12:14,920
I'm good.

180
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,440
What about you, Peak?

181
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:20,440
I'm alright.

182
00:12:24,640 --> 00:12:26,520
Are you and Jim...

183
00:12:26,520 --> 00:12:28,520
actually dating?

184
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:33,920
Are you guys a couple?

185
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,720
Um...

186
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:45,600
should be soon.

187
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:53,120
Is that all you wanna ask?

188
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,600
What!?

189
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,000
Then I'm going in now.
It's late night.

190
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:01,920
So you really don't know...

191
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:05,960
how I feel about you?

192
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:11,600
I like you!

193
00:13:12,640 --> 00:13:15,480
I like you since
the very first day we met...

194
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,800
And I've been liking you since then...

195
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,680
until now.

196
00:13:19,680 --> 00:13:22,080
I really like you.

197
00:13:22,080 --> 00:13:25,120
And why're you acting like
you have no clue?

198
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:34,200
What are you talking about?

199
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:37,920
You're still young,
how come you like me?

200
00:13:38,600 --> 00:13:41,680
Let's just go.
It's already late.

201
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,440
Can you just stop
changing the topic?

202
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:48,720
I'm young and so what?

203
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:51,360
Did you hear what I just said?

204
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,440
I'm not rehearsing
the script with you.

205
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:14,200
I think you should stop thinking
about all these.

206
00:14:14,200 --> 00:14:17,600
You're still young, Peak.

207
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:20,760
When you said you like me...

208
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:26,560
maybe it's just...

209
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,960
a temporary feeling.

210
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,480
Who are you?

211
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,600
to have the right to think for me?

212
00:14:40,600 --> 00:14:42,440
I'm sorry.

213
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,280
If you don't like me,
just tell it to my face.

214
00:14:52,280 --> 00:14:55,960
But please don't tell me that
I'm not serious about this.

215
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:40,000
You rejected him...

216
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
and here you are...regretting everything.
Is it right to do that?

217
00:15:46,120 --> 00:15:51,400
It's best for everyone this way
...for now.

218
00:15:51,400 --> 00:15:55,880
You've seen him.
He's just a 9th grade kid.

219
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,640
We were also in love
during junior high, weren't we?

220
00:16:05,320 --> 00:16:09,000
But this is a college and a junior high kid.

221
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,600
So...

222
00:16:11,600 --> 00:16:13,720
you want me to tell my mom...

223
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,960
that 'hey I'm dating my baby brother's friend'?

224
00:16:16,960 --> 00:16:20,200
Or introduce Peak as my boyfriend
to all of our friends?

225
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:25,160
I'm not ready for that.

226
00:16:25,640 --> 00:16:27,120
Another thing...

227
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:31,880
We haven't even started the relationship
and it's been like this, I'm not ready mentally.

228
00:16:31,880 --> 00:16:34,640
And you think it's gonna work out
in the future?

229
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,000
But in a relationship...

230
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:43,000
it's just you and Peak.

231
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:45,000
There's no one else involves.

232
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:48,480
But we cannot disregard
surrounding factors right?

233
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:54,080
Also, we've been through his age before.

234
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,160
You know it well...

235
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,880
that back then and now
is totally different.

236
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,520
For me and Peak,

237
00:17:04,520 --> 00:17:07,839
this is not the right time.

238
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,720
And...

239
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:16,000
when do you think
it's the right time?

240
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:21,040
I don't know.

241
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,920
When we see each other again next time...

242
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,560
And when is that?

243
00:17:37,560 --> 00:17:41,000
No matter when and where...

244
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:44,040
Peak's age and yours
are still different, isn't it?

245
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:50,000
The problem is in your heart.

246
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:54,840
It doesn't matter what I think.

247
00:17:54,840 --> 00:17:59,560
Sad or happy
...you have to face it yourself.

248
00:17:59,560 --> 00:18:02,600
I'm not in the place
where I can make any decision for you.

249
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,240
But I just don't want you
to regret everything later, Hom.

250
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:12,240
Um.

251
00:18:13,920 --> 00:18:15,280
Thanks.

252
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:18,440
You don't have to thank me.

253
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:21,320
Here eat up!

254
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:23,120
Ahhh.

255
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:25,800
Good?

256
00:18:25,800 --> 00:18:28,640
Here eat.

257
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,200
Just eat yours.
Don't worry about me.

258
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:37,280
So you're never gonna ask me first?

259
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:43,680
What do you want me to ask you for?

260
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,720
Moving abroad is a huge thing.

261
00:18:50,720 --> 00:18:53,920
So you're not gonna ask me
how do I feel about that?

262
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:57,680
I have to move anyway.

263
00:18:59,440 --> 00:19:01,800
Why do you say it like that?

264
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,800
I'm your girlfriend.

265
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:06,960
Being apart for 3 years,
how is it going to work for us?

266
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:12,040
and what do you want me to do?

267
00:19:24,680 --> 00:19:27,800
Do you wanna break up with me?

268
00:19:31,160 --> 00:19:34,840
Why do you ask?
Do you want to?

269
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:36,840
No.

270
00:19:36,840 --> 00:19:40,560
I just thought that you will do it
anyway at the end.

271
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:43,160
Because I have to move anyway.

272
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:47,200
and we haven't seen each other for awhile
like we used to either.

273
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:49,880
I wanna spend time with Eiw more.

274
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:57,600
But you're about to move abroad?

275
00:19:57,600 --> 00:20:00,280
you still wanna spend time with your friend?

276
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:01,800
What about me?

277
00:20:01,800 --> 00:20:05,080
But I only have very little time left
for him already.

278
00:20:06,840 --> 00:20:09,160
Very little time left for him?

279
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:11,280
Whenever I call you,
you're always with Eiw.

280
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:16,160
After school you're always
'I have to go home. Eiw is waiting'

281
00:20:17,920 --> 00:20:19,560
What's wrong with you?

282
00:20:19,560 --> 00:20:21,560
Huh?

283
00:20:22,560 --> 00:20:25,880
I've always been with you after school.

284
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,840
when I go home,
I'm always on MSN talking to you.

285
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:32,440
I also call you before bed for hours.

286
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:35,960
These are all the time I have
and I've been given you

287
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:40,160
So are you saying I've been taking
See-Eiw's time, right?

288
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:42,680
No.

289
00:20:44,200 --> 00:20:45,680
You're always like this.

290
00:20:45,680 --> 00:20:46,600
Full of sarcasm.

291
00:20:46,600 --> 00:20:49,280
You always say Eiw is not good.
He's annoying.

292
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:51,920
You told me you don't like him.

293
00:20:51,920 --> 00:20:54,360
Eiw never said anything about you.

294
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:57,600
He never said that he doesn't like you.

295
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,480
Who's gonna like it?

296
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:05,400
A boyfriend who sees his friend
as a priority.

297
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:09,320
I just wanna be
and spend time with him.

298
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:12,280
Just like the old days that's all.

299
00:21:15,560 --> 00:21:18,400
You are my boyfriend.

300
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:21,600
Shouldn't I come first?

301
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:24,080
And why are we still dating then?

302
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:27,640
I just wanna share my time
to both of you.

303
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,920
Being a couple means we have to be
with each other all the time...is that so?

304
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:35,640
But the rest of the time
that you have left,

305
00:21:35,640 --> 00:21:38,520
shouldn't it be mine?

306
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:40,920
If you're not going to
understand me at all,

307
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:43,880
and always think we can't stay apart
from each other like this...

308
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:45,520
when I go to America...

309
00:21:45,520 --> 00:21:47,880
you probably will break up with me anyway.

310
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:51,080
Huh?

311
00:21:51,080 --> 00:21:53,400
What did you say?

312
00:21:57,360 --> 00:22:00,240
Let's just break up now.

313
00:22:40,040 --> 00:22:41,520
Cake.

314
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,040
How was it?

315
00:22:48,040 --> 00:22:50,040
Is she upset?

316
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,560
She is.

317
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:57,040
Hey what did you do then?

318
00:22:57,040 --> 00:22:59,080
Well...

319
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:02,240
I didn't do anything.

320
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:05,000
Didn't do anything?
How?

321
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,400
Did you guys talk it through?

322
00:23:11,960 --> 00:23:13,720
We did.

323
00:23:14,640 --> 00:23:18,680
and did she understand?

324
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:24,720
She should be.

325
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,480
Ugh Cake!

326
00:23:27,480 --> 00:23:31,360
How did she understand
just tell me!?

327
00:23:31,800 --> 00:23:34,880
Forget it.

328
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:36,640
All you need to know is that...

329
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:38,640
I can spend more time
with you from now on.

330
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,680
That's all.

331
00:23:42,120 --> 00:23:44,360
What do you mean?

332
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:52,080
I mean...

333
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:56,360
I broke up with her.

334
00:23:56,360 --> 00:23:58,440
Huh!?

335
00:23:58,440 --> 00:24:00,440
Why?

336
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,720
You guys fought?

337
00:24:05,720 --> 00:24:08,000
Because you...

338
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:11,560
are not gonna be here anymore?

339
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:21,480
Nobody can wait for me that long.

340
00:24:46,480 --> 00:24:48,760
Cake.

341
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:50,760
Hm?

342
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:53,760
Why are you still awake?

343
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:57,040
I cannot sleep.

344
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:02,600
What's the matter?
Why can't you sleep lately?

345
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,040
About Rin...

346
00:25:08,040 --> 00:25:10,360
Are you okay?

347
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:15,040
Still thinking about that?

348
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:18,400
I told you to not worry about it.

349
00:25:18,400 --> 00:25:21,640
I’m okay.

350
00:25:21,640 --> 00:25:24,760
How can you be?

351
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:29,720
I already talked to Rin.

352
00:25:29,720 --> 00:25:33,320
If we didn’t break up now,

353
00:25:33,320 --> 00:25:36,840
when I leave to America,
we would do it then anyway.

354
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,400
But you regret about that, don’t you?

355
00:25:57,520 --> 00:25:59,920
Cake.

356
00:26:04,760 --> 00:26:10,360
I’m fine...really.

357
00:26:10,360 --> 00:26:14,040
If you wanna cry,

358
00:26:14,040 --> 00:26:16,640
You can.

359
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:19,840
You can always cry with me.

360
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:27,960
I don’t want to cry at all.

361
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:36,440
I mean if you have to.

362
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,880
You don’t have to cry by yourself.

363
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:55,720
Then if I wanna cry,

364
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,720
I will come cry with you.

365
00:26:57,720 --> 00:26:59,720
Okay?

366
00:27:01,520 --> 00:27:02,560
Um.

367
00:27:03,960 --> 00:27:06,040
Okay.

368
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:42,320
Eiw.

369
00:27:46,080 --> 00:27:49,200
Please wait for me
to come back, will you?

370
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,120
I don’t care
if no one else waits for me,

371
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:55,280
But could you please wait for me?

372
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,760
Cake, wake up!

373
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,920
Why are you making that face?

374
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:37,640
How come you are awake
so early?

375
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,480
I'm such an early bird, right?

376
00:28:39,480 --> 00:28:42,040
Do you wanna shower first?
Or you want me to go first?

377
00:28:46,400 --> 00:28:49,200
Why are you looking at me like that?
I will go shower first then.

378
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:50,960
It’s just odd. Wait…

379
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,920
Why did you wake up so early?
Did you get any sleep?

380
00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:56,960
Yes I did.

381
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,960
Why did you ask me that?

382
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,080
It’s just weird.

383
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:03,400
Normally, you never wake up
no matter how hard I try.

384
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:06,080
Hey I just wanna
get up early sometimes.

385
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:09,160
I can’t always have you
waking me up everyday, can I?

386
00:29:09,160 --> 00:29:11,920
I will go take a shower, ok?

387
00:29:36,280 --> 00:29:39,960
Today you’ll have to pretend
to get on the bus alone.

388
00:29:39,960 --> 00:29:41,760
Hm?

389
00:29:42,120 --> 00:29:43,800
Why?

390
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:45,680
Well…

391
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:48,680
So when I’m not around,
you can be on the bus on your own.

392
00:29:49,960 --> 00:29:53,120
So you can survive better, ok?

393
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:56,120
Um.

394
00:31:06,480 --> 00:31:07,920
Keep the balance.

395
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:10,120
If you can’t keep the balance
then just lean on me.

396
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:12,640
I can do it.

397
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:14,640
Right.

398
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:16,280
If you fell,
I'm not gonna help you.

399
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,960
Yeah you’re being such a smart mouth,

400
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:20,720
If you fell,

401
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,960
I won't help
and will even rub it in.

402
00:31:35,120 --> 00:31:37,680
Haha you passed the ball to him.

403
00:31:55,920 --> 00:31:58,840
Hey you guys can go ahead
and continue the game.

404
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:04,040
Here drink.

405
00:32:04,040 --> 00:32:05,160
Thank you.

406
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:06,560
Aren't you tired?

407
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,640
Is it too hot here?

408
00:32:10,640 --> 00:32:12,720
I'm fine.
I should ask you.

409
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:15,360
Are you too hot?
Your back is soaked with sweat.

410
00:32:16,080 --> 00:32:18,720
It's so sunny out today.

411
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:22,840
Cake.

412
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:24,320
-Yes?
- So...

413
00:32:24,320 --> 00:32:27,240
Student council actually has
a trash collecting campaign.

414
00:32:27,240 --> 00:32:28,720
And we came to a conclusion that...

415
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:32,520
we would like to have you as an ambassador
on the poster to promote.

416
00:32:33,400 --> 00:32:34,480
Me?

417
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:37,560
Yeah you.
Can't be anyone else.

418
00:32:37,560 --> 00:32:39,800
And are you free this evening?

419
00:32:39,800 --> 00:32:43,520
Can we have an hour with you?

420
00:32:43,520 --> 00:32:45,960
Oh...

421
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,360
I will go wait with you.

422
00:32:50,360 --> 00:32:52,080
You sure?

423
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,320
Please, Cake!

424
00:32:55,720 --> 00:32:58,680
Ok. I will meet you
at the council room after school.

425
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:02,320
Thank you so much.
See you, Cake.

426
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,320
Sure.

427
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,120
Are you sure?

428
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:08,600
I am.

429
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:09,680
You sure?

430
00:33:10,240 --> 00:33:12,200
-Sure or not?
-I'm sure!

431
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:14,200
Ok see you then.

432
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:16,960
Here give me.
I'll handle that.

433
00:33:16,960 --> 00:33:19,360
-Go back to your game.
-I'm gonna go back and play.

434
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:21,360
My hair is all messy.

435
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:29,240
Cake is my first love.

436
00:33:29,240 --> 00:33:32,960
I'm not sure the possibility
that I would be successful with my first love.

437
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,960
Would I even get the 12% chance?

438
00:33:34,960 --> 00:33:36,440
Or would I have a second love?

439
00:33:36,440 --> 00:33:37,440
Third?

440
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:38,320
Forth?

441
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:39,760
When would it be?

442
00:33:39,760 --> 00:33:44,400
Would it be tomorrow? The day after tomorrow?
Next month or even next year?

443
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,400
When Cake is in America...

444
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:48,400
...or when Cake is back.

445
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,400
I have no idea.

446
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,240
I can't help but laugh about it...

447
00:33:52,240 --> 00:33:54,920
when I realized that I love him...

448
00:33:54,920 --> 00:33:57,680
...but he has to be so far away now.

449
00:33:57,680 --> 00:33:59,920
I can't help but doubt...

450
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:03,920
whether 12% is more than
I can hope or not?

451
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,920
Cake.

452
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,920
If the day that you come back,

453
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:11,960
I still love you the same.

454
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:16,480
If it turned out to be a real love,
and not a silly nonsense story during our childhood.

455
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,440
If I could fall in love with the same person...

456
00:34:19,440 --> 00:34:21,000
...for the second time

457
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:22,320
...third

458
00:34:22,320 --> 00:34:23,840
forth or even fifth time,

459
00:34:23,840 --> 00:34:26,159
if that's the case,

460
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:30,480
Would the possibility of us
be more than 12%?

461
00:34:36,719 --> 00:34:38,199
Are you ok there brother?

462
00:34:38,199 --> 00:34:40,560
Here comes the veggies.

463
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:42,520
It's not even hot.

464
00:34:42,520 --> 00:34:43,920
Waiting for so long.

465
00:34:44,639 --> 00:34:45,920
Step. Step.

466
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,679
Is that all?

467
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:51,920
-Looks so good.
-Do we have everything?

468
00:34:51,920 --> 00:34:53,800
Is there anything left inside?

469
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,920
It's in front of me.

470
00:34:56,960 --> 00:34:58,800
There.
Dad's going to get it already.

471
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,800
I will distribute the glasses.

472
00:35:01,800 --> 00:35:03,040
Did you get a glass mom?

473
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:04,880
Cake here's your glass.

474
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:07,800
- This is your glass, Cake.
- You want me to pour the sauce in the soup , mom?

475
00:35:09,200 --> 00:35:09,960
Cake.

476
00:35:09,960 --> 00:35:11,360
Hand us the plate.

477
00:35:11,360 --> 00:35:13,360
Mom!

478
00:35:17,960 --> 00:35:20,320
Come one!
Give us the plate and utensil.

479
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:21,000
Ok. Ok.

480
00:35:21,200 --> 00:35:22,300
Here's the utensil.

481
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,300
What's wrong?
Oh.

482
00:35:24,300 --> 00:35:26,300
Cake!

483
00:35:26,300 --> 00:35:28,300
You are obviously messing with me.

484
00:35:28,300 --> 00:35:30,300
I'm not.
I'm trying to put it on you.

485
00:35:30,880 --> 00:35:32,160
So itchy.

486
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:34,240
That's tofu.

487
00:35:34,240 --> 00:35:36,240
Just lift and drink it.
You could spill.

488
00:35:36,240 --> 00:35:37,960
That's okay.

489
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,560
Oh the egg tofu comes in a big chunk?

490
00:35:50,560 --> 00:35:52,080
Cake these are some veggies. Here...

491
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,080
You put this in, Pao?

492
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,040
You did?

493
00:35:57,400 --> 00:35:59,360
Yeah put it in.

494
00:35:59,720 --> 00:36:01,720
Cake you wiped it on me, didn't you?

495
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:03,080
Stop it's dirty.

496
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:04,720
Here. Here. Here.

497
00:36:04,720 --> 00:36:06,360
Where are you taking that?

498
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:07,640
Let me guess.

499
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:15,640
Cake the pork will splash the oil!

500
00:36:15,640 --> 00:36:17,400
Fry it for me dad.

501
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:19,480
Dad what do you say?

502
00:36:31,240 --> 00:36:33,160
Are you bringing this?

503
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:35,080
Hey!

504
00:36:35,360 --> 00:36:36,760
That's so old.

505
00:36:36,760 --> 00:36:37,840
Why?

506
00:36:37,840 --> 00:36:39,000
I miss it so much.

507
00:36:40,920 --> 00:36:42,480
It's my treasure.

508
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,600
Hey Cake.

509
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:48,240
I remember this yo-yo, it was a free gift
that came with the school uniform.

510
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,080
Here. Here. Here.

511
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,120
Haven't seen this for so long.

512
00:36:57,120 --> 00:36:58,200
Put it by your ear.

513
00:36:58,200 --> 00:36:59,920
Eiw!

514
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,280
What's up?

515
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:02,160
Can you hear me?

516
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,920
I can but the signal
is not so good, Cake.

517
00:37:08,240 --> 00:37:09,680
Eiw?

518
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,040
What?

519
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:11,440
Eiw?

520
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,920
Ow.

521
00:37:12,920 --> 00:37:14,160
Sweetie!

522
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,160
Seasoning!

523
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:21,600
Seasoning!

524
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,600
Sweetie!

525
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:30,840
Cake.

526
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:33,600
Hm?

527
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:40,040
Still awake?

528
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:44,240
Don't ask me. It's you.
Why are you awake?

529
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:46,400
It's late night already.

530
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:52,080
I don't want tomorrow to comes.

531
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:00,200
You might not be able to wake up
and drop me off tomorrow.

532
00:38:02,840 --> 00:38:04,600
I can.

533
00:38:07,880 --> 00:38:10,960
If I cannot wake up
then who will wake you up?

534
00:38:14,440 --> 00:38:15,640
Yeah right.

535
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:25,280
Are you nervous?

536
00:38:29,480 --> 00:38:30,520
Um.

537
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:33,920
A bit.

538
00:38:40,280 --> 00:38:42,200
From now on...

539
00:38:42,200 --> 00:38:44,840
you have to wake up by yourself.

540
00:38:45,400 --> 00:38:47,360
You can't be a sleepyhead anymore.

541
00:38:50,280 --> 00:38:51,360
Um.

542
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:08,640
When you're there,

543
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:11,920
my brother said the food there is pretty fatty./the food there might make you gain weight.

544
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:16,160
don't forget to eat vegetables too.

545
00:39:16,360 --> 00:39:19,240
If not you might be unhealthy,
you know that right?

546
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:23,640
You too.

547
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:25,640
Eat more food too, ok?

548
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,280
You're so skinny.

549
00:39:30,280 --> 00:39:32,760
I'm serious.

550
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,280
When I'm not around,

551
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,640
you need to make lots of new friends.

552
00:39:49,200 --> 00:39:51,080
Promise?

553
00:39:51,800 --> 00:39:54,760
Get to know lots of people.

554
00:39:55,920 --> 00:39:58,200
so when anything happens,
they can help you.

555
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:00,440
Understand?

556
00:40:02,080 --> 00:40:04,160
Understood.

557
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,360
That's good.

558
00:40:14,120 --> 00:40:16,320
When I'm not here...

559
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,320
you need to take good care
of yourself ok?

560
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:19,680
Do you understand?

561
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:24,000
Take care of yourself as good
as I take care of you.

562
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,640
You too.

563
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:33,280
Take care of yourself too.

564
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:39,720
I'm not gonna be around
doing things for you anymore.

565
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:48,520
It's you
who should take good care of yourself.

566
00:40:49,960 --> 00:40:52,840
You have to ride the bus alone.

567
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:58,600
I'm not gonna be here bugging you
in the morning anymore.

568
00:40:59,600 --> 00:41:01,000
Do you realize that?

569
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:05,760
Um.

570
00:41:08,040 --> 00:41:10,160
When you're at school,

571
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:12,960
I will no longer be a problem
in your eyes.

572
00:41:22,360 --> 00:41:24,000
Hug me.

573
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,000
I won't be there for you
to hug me anymore.

574
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:42,840
Don't forget me please.

575
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,480
How can I forget?

576
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:56,080
You have to wait for me please.

577
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:04,160
I will be back.

578
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:06,960
I will be the one who wakes you up instead.
You'll see.

579
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:11,400
I will wait for you.

580
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,890
Good luck.

581
00:42:30,900 --> 00:42:33,090
How are you doing?

582
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:34,930
since Cake is not around.

583
00:42:34,930 --> 00:42:36,930
I feel like…

584
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:38,930
I’m all alone in this world.

585
00:42:39,530 --> 00:42:41,450
You need to live your life too, Eiw.

586
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:44,580
Live even better than when Cake is here.

587
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:46,350
Let’s change ourselves, shall we?

588
00:42:46,350 --> 00:42:48,350
Make Cake super amazed when he’s back,

589
00:42:48,350 --> 00:42:50,350
okay?
