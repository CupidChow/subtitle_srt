1
00:00:11,300 --> 00:00:12,600
Are you okay?

2
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:21,600
If I'm not.

3
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:23,950
Is Cake not gonna go?

4
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:27,320
He will be back soon.

5
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:29,050
Time flies so fast.

6
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:32,950
It's 3 years.

7
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:34,600
By that time...

8
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:36,600
we might not be close anymore.

9
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,800
You and Cake...

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,900
knowing each other
since you were born.

11
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:46,120
It's been 15 years.

12
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:48,770
Being apart for only 3 years...

13
00:00:50,170 --> 00:00:52,450
is not even a quarter of time
you guys know each other.

14
00:00:55,750 --> 00:00:57,620
Trust me, Eiw.

15
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:00,250
Nothing's gonna change...

16
00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,870
between you and Cake.

17
00:01:06,470 --> 00:01:07,350
Um.

18
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,570
I'm not gonna cry today.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,950
I already promised Cake.

20
00:01:15,550 --> 00:01:17,370
You promised the difficult stuff.

21
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:19,420
you sure you can do it, son?

22
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:21,420
Mom!

23
00:01:21,870 --> 00:01:23,050
You can go!

24
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:30,170
We're leaving now.

25
00:01:30,820 --> 00:01:32,170
Take care of yourself.

26
00:01:32,570 --> 00:01:35,650
Safe flight uncle Thenet,
aunty Proud.

27
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,300
Sure.

28
00:01:38,470 --> 00:01:39,950
Have a safe trip.

29
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,950
Please write us sometimes.

30
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:46,370
Please don't forget me.

31
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:48,070
Promise me?

32
00:01:48,070 --> 00:01:49,570
I won't.

33
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:51,800
I will wait for Cream to come back.

34
00:01:51,800 --> 00:01:53,700
Take care of yourself over there.

35
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:54,020
Yes.

36
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,570
Don't get sick, okay?

37
00:01:56,570 --> 00:01:58,300
Well...we're gonna get going.

38
00:01:58,300 --> 00:02:00,200
Will come back to visit.

39
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:01,350
Sure.

40
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,970
Let's go. Get in the car.

41
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:03,600
Come on.

42
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:04,770
-Goodbye Thanet.
-Good bye.

43
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:05,770
Bye.

44
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:07,000
-You can go wait in the car.
-Good bye.

45
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:08,669
I will talk to Eiw first.

46
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,169
Bye bye, Cream.

47
00:02:10,699 --> 00:02:12,050
See you.

48
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:17,720
Have a good talk, ok?

49
00:02:21,070 --> 00:02:21,820
Bye bye.

50
00:02:21,820 --> 00:02:22,950
Bye.

51
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,450
Good bye, aunty.

52
00:02:25,250 --> 00:02:26,820
I will be inside.

53
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:29,650
Good luck Cake.

54
00:02:29,650 --> 00:02:30,500
So long brother.

55
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:31,750
-Good bye.
-See you.

56
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:53,820
I will have to go now, Eiw.

57
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:57,650
Please don't cry.

58
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,020
Um.

59
00:03:02,250 --> 00:03:04,050
I won't.

60
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,220
We promised each other already.

61
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,200
I will...

62
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,770
be back soon.

63
00:03:18,070 --> 00:03:20,270
Can 'soon'
be less than 3 years?

64
00:03:23,470 --> 00:03:25,700
Can't be.

65
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:28,100
But I will try to be back
as soon as possible, okay?

66
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,480
Don't cry.

67
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,900
Take care of yourself Eiw.

68
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,800
You too. Take care.

69
00:04:34,420 --> 00:04:36,750
Please don't get sick.

70
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:40,070
I know.

71
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:44,670
Take care of yourself
as good as I take care of you, okay?

72
00:04:44,670 --> 00:04:45,970
I know.

73
00:04:48,820 --> 00:04:50,570
I'm so lame.

74
00:04:50,750 --> 00:04:53,720
I promised you not to cry.

75
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:22,050
Poor thing.

76
00:05:22,250 --> 00:05:23,800
Don't cry.

77
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,000
Good luck.

78
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:38,750
Good luck to you too, Cake.

79
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:42,870
Take care of yourself.

80
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:43,850
Um.

81
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,850
You too.

82
00:07:26,900 --> 00:07:28,470
Bye bye, Cake.

83
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:32,120
Best of luck.

84
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:15,050
Cake.

85
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:19,770
What are you doing here?

86
00:08:20,470 --> 00:08:23,150
Nothing. Just chilling.

87
00:08:23,150 --> 00:08:24,720
What are you doing out here?

88
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,520
I came out here
looking for you.

89
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,520
You've been gone too long.

90
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:34,620
And...

91
00:08:34,620 --> 00:08:37,220
have you talked to Rin lately?

92
00:08:37,220 --> 00:08:39,620
Did you tell her that
you're going to America soon?

93
00:08:42,169 --> 00:08:43,720
I have not.

94
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,850
But I guess I will have to tell her soon.

95
00:08:48,950 --> 00:08:50,120
Let's go inside.

96
00:08:51,770 --> 00:08:52,770
Eiw.

97
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:55,270
I have something for you.

98
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,200
What is it?

99
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,120
That big of a deal?

100
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:09,470
Thank you.

101
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,470
This will be there for you.

102
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,670
To help dry your tears
when I'm not around.

103
00:09:19,970 --> 00:09:21,420
I won't get to use it.

104
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:23,320
I'm not gonna have a single tear.

105
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:24,950
that day I say good bye to you.

106
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:29,170
You mean no snot dripping?

107
00:09:30,170 --> 00:09:31,550
Let's go inside.

108
00:09:31,550 --> 00:09:34,200
Who gets inside first win!

109
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:35,420
Hey.

110
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:37,120
Cheater.

111
00:10:44,420 --> 00:10:46,420
Cake.

112
00:11:51,870 --> 00:11:54,320
Wow banana in sticky rice?

113
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:56,320
Can I have 2, Eiw?

114
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,900
So good.

115
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,950
Eat it.

116
00:12:03,950 --> 00:12:06,350
Eat more,
so you can gain weight.

117
00:12:10,570 --> 00:12:12,820
Eat.
Why are you holding it still?

118
00:12:43,280 --> 00:12:45,560
Mom.

119
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,360
I'm gonna go to schook now.

120
00:12:51,950 --> 00:12:53,320
Have you eaten son?

121
00:12:58,050 --> 00:12:59,820
I did mom.

122
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:01,820
I had 1 banana with sticky rice.

123
00:13:03,820 --> 00:13:06,120
You want your brother
to take you?

124
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,120
Are you sure you can go
by yourself?

125
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:10,120
I'm sure.

126
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,500
Ride the bus safely.

127
00:13:14,170 --> 00:13:15,800
I'm gonna leave to school then.

128
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,500
Ah...students.

129
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:13,120
please bring out the sheet
I gave to you guys last week.

130
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:21,100
Anyone didn't do it?

131
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:24,870
Can I copy yours?

132
00:14:26,070 --> 00:14:27,070
I don't know how to do it.

133
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:31,320
Hey.

134
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,720
Why do you look so absent minded?

135
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:39,950
Next, no.22.

136
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:43,070
No.22

137
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:46,120
Mr.Montakarn.

138
00:14:48,900 --> 00:14:49,700
Yes?

139
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:52,700
Answer question 3 please.

140
00:14:55,970 --> 00:14:59,670
I don't know how.
I'm sorry.

141
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:02,650
Concentrate in the class please.
What's the matter?

142
00:15:02,650 --> 00:15:04,400
You look so distracted all day.

143
00:15:04,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Sit down.

144
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:10,270
Anyone else can answer this question?

145
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:13,950
What's the matter with him, any idea Kung?

146
00:15:13,950 --> 00:15:15,050
Hm?

147
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:32,220
Eiw.

148
00:16:34,650 --> 00:16:36,070
-Eiw.
-Huh!?

149
00:16:36,950 --> 00:16:38,400
What's up, Fee?

150
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:40,670
You've been playing with the rice
and it's almost out of the plate.

151
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:45,020
Are you alright, Eiw?

152
00:16:45,850 --> 00:16:47,800
Um. I'm okay.

153
00:16:48,470 --> 00:16:50,920
Why are you
so distracted lately?

154
00:16:50,920 --> 00:16:52,520
Are you really okay?

155
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:55,370
You can always tell
me and Kung everything, you know?

156
00:16:58,550 --> 00:16:59,950
I'm okay.

157
00:17:02,020 --> 00:17:03,720
If you're okay,
then eat up please.

158
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:06,270
You eat very little.

159
00:17:08,450 --> 00:17:10,020
I'm not that hungry lately.

160
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:31,820
I'll go sleep over
at your place this Friday.

161
00:17:34,470 --> 00:17:35,570
Sleep over at my place?

162
00:17:35,570 --> 00:17:37,220
Um.

163
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:39,220
I haven't slept over
for so long.

164
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:41,450
Are you free this weekend?

165
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,500
Um sure.

166
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:46,850
I don't have any plans.

167
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:49,070
Then I will pack my bag
to school on Friday.

168
00:17:49,070 --> 00:17:50,920
and go straight to
your home with you.

169
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:52,620
Do you wanna join us, Kung?

170
00:17:52,620 --> 00:17:54,620
Erm...I'm not free this weekend.

171
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,970
I'm going on a trip with my family.

172
00:17:56,970 --> 00:17:59,620
That's fine.
Next time then.

173
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:00,720
Um.

174
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,720
Eat up, Eiw.

175
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,750
It's all your favorite.

176
00:18:05,750 --> 00:18:07,250
Eat.

177
00:18:49,400 --> 00:18:50,620
Eiw.

178
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:51,920
Yes mom?

179
00:18:51,920 --> 00:18:54,370
Oh you closed already?

180
00:18:54,370 --> 00:18:55,770
I did.

181
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:57,850
I haven't seen you eaten anything.

182
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:03,000
I'm not that hungry mom.

183
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,400
It's almost 6 already.

184
00:19:04,400 --> 00:19:06,400
Go have dinner,
so you can shower.

185
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,950
You also went to bed late last night.

186
00:19:07,950 --> 00:19:10,770
I saw the lights outside my room
were on until late.

187
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:15,000
I'm actually waiting for
Cake to be on MSN.

188
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:16,550
But you need to eat too.

189
00:19:16,550 --> 00:19:18,550
The food is getting cold.

190
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,220
Sure I will go down
and eat first then.

191
00:19:39,400 --> 00:19:40,900
Stop teasing me.

192
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:43,350
Cake.

193
00:21:09,450 --> 00:21:10,600
Oh Pao.

194
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,050
It's not even 7am over there Eiw.

195
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:19,800
He's not gonna be online yet.

196
00:21:21,070 --> 00:21:23,820
Um I know.

197
00:21:27,300 --> 00:21:29,400
Do you wanna go find
something to eat?

198
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,400
Let's go buy some fun toys.

199
00:21:32,150 --> 00:21:33,450
No.

200
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:36,420
I don't wanna go.

201
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:45,300
You've been sitting in front of the computer all week.

202
00:21:47,850 --> 00:21:50,150
Just in case he might be on MSN.

203
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:53,120
You know that...

204
00:21:53,970 --> 00:21:56,370
there's a timezone
between here and there right?

205
00:21:57,650 --> 00:21:59,250
Um I am well aware.

206
00:22:00,170 --> 00:22:01,650
So you should know...

207
00:22:02,770 --> 00:22:05,020
that he's probably
going to school right now.

208
00:22:06,570 --> 00:22:09,100
Why're you waiting for him
like this everyday still?

209
00:22:12,470 --> 00:22:16,620
I just hope that Cake might have the time
to be on MSN for 5 mins.

210
00:22:25,370 --> 00:22:27,250
You really think that way?

211
00:22:29,250 --> 00:22:30,650
Eiw.

212
00:22:32,870 --> 00:22:35,320
You need to live your life.

213
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,650
Make it better than
when Cake was here.

214
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:42,570
Take care of yourself better
than what Cake did for you.

215
00:22:42,570 --> 00:22:44,770
You need to be more grown up.

216
00:22:45,250 --> 00:22:46,970
and also improved.

217
00:22:48,020 --> 00:22:50,220
You cannot stay
the same or be worse...

218
00:22:50,370 --> 00:22:52,550
for Cake to see
when he's back, can you?

219
00:22:57,970 --> 00:22:58,920
Um.

220
00:23:01,300 --> 00:23:03,520
I need to be a better person.

221
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:06,200
Good boy!

222
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,650
If the timezone is your issue,

223
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:18,650
I have a suggestion for you.

224
00:23:23,250 --> 00:23:24,200
Evening mom!

225
00:23:24,200 --> 00:23:25,300
Oh you're home.

226
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:27,950
Go change and come down to eat.
The food is in the kitchen.

227
00:23:27,950 --> 00:23:29,670
Sure.
I'll just turn on the computer real quick.

228
00:23:29,670 --> 00:23:32,100
Hm...computer first thing huh?

229
00:23:32,100 --> 00:23:34,650
Yeah a bit...I'm gone mom.

230
00:24:02,370 --> 00:24:03,900
I'm doing well.

231
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:05,800
It's super cold here.

232
00:24:05,800 --> 00:24:09,270
Compared to our country, it's like 10 times colder
than the A/C.

233
00:24:09,270 --> 00:24:11,020
Cream shivers all the time.

234
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:13,320
She always throws a fit
when she has to shower.

235
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:15,150
And I think...

236
00:24:15,150 --> 00:24:19,600
you probably frown, if you find out that I never take a shower
in the morning since I moved here.

237
00:24:20,500 --> 00:24:22,350
Please don't be mad at me,
it's really cold.

238
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,350
You ask me everyday how am I.

239
00:24:25,350 --> 00:24:27,650
And how are you Eiw?

240
00:24:27,650 --> 00:24:29,650
You never talked about yourself.

241
00:24:29,650 --> 00:24:31,770
You've got any new friends?

242
00:24:31,770 --> 00:24:33,550
And did you join any clubs...

243
00:24:33,550 --> 00:24:35,370
that I told you to do so?

244
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:38,170
There're so many interesting clubs
in high school.

245
00:24:38,170 --> 00:24:40,750
Peak told me he'll join movie club.

246
00:24:40,750 --> 00:24:43,370
There's a huge screen in the club.

247
00:24:43,370 --> 00:24:47,070
I've been busy lately.
Just started playing American football.

248
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,420
Super exhausted,
but it's so much fun.

249
00:24:50,420 --> 00:24:52,420
My English is still terrible.

250
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:55,320
but at least better than
the first day I got here.

251
00:24:55,400 --> 00:24:58,670
Cream stops crying now when
she hears people speak English.

252
00:24:58,670 --> 00:25:00,300
She was crying so hard,

253
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,200
when next door kids
tried to play with her.

254
00:25:02,200 --> 00:25:04,670
I laugh every time
just thinking about it.

255
00:25:04,670 --> 00:25:07,170
She say she misses Pao everyday.

256
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,800
Take care of yourself.

257
00:25:10,250 --> 00:25:12,120
Don't get sick.

258
00:25:12,120 --> 00:25:13,970
Next email, please tell me
about your life more!

259
00:25:14,650 --> 00:25:16,620
I miss you Eiw.

260
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,620
Miss you a lot.

261
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,170
Cake.

262
00:25:50,870 --> 00:25:52,250
You're still awake, Fee?

263
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,570
I'm not that sleepy.

264
00:25:59,570 --> 00:26:01,150
And...

265
00:26:01,150 --> 00:26:03,300
How are you holding up?

266
00:26:03,300 --> 00:26:05,300
Feeling better?

267
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,650
What do you mean
how am I holding up?

268
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,770
I mean...

269
00:26:11,770 --> 00:26:13,620
since Cake is not around...

270
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:15,170
are you alright with that situation?

271
00:26:19,850 --> 00:26:21,470
Well...

272
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:24,870
I miss him.

273
00:26:27,850 --> 00:26:31,270
I think he misses you too.

274
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,100
I know that for you is really bad.

275
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:40,550
But you can't stay sad
and depressed like this forever.

276
00:26:40,550 --> 00:26:43,570
I do care about you,
you know that right?

277
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:46,550
Kung also.
He's worried too

278
00:26:52,850 --> 00:26:54,300
Fee.

279
00:27:02,150 --> 00:27:04,070
You wanna know what's funny?

280
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:07,400
I feel like...

281
00:27:07,400 --> 00:27:09,570
I'm such a looser.

282
00:27:10,300 --> 00:27:11,950
Back then...

283
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,320
I was fine with
not having many friends.

284
00:27:15,050 --> 00:27:17,750
I was quite at school.
Didn't care about anything.

285
00:27:18,770 --> 00:27:20,550
When I came home,

286
00:27:20,550 --> 00:27:22,900
I always had Cake with me.

287
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:27,570
But when he's not here....

288
00:27:30,150 --> 00:27:33,220
I have no one
when I come back home.

289
00:27:34,270 --> 00:27:36,450
I feel like...

290
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:39,050
I'm all alone in this world.

291
00:27:42,570 --> 00:27:47,520
It's more of
you attaching yourself with Cake.

292
00:27:50,850 --> 00:27:53,600
I don't know what to do, Fee

293
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,250
I feel super uncomfortable,

294
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:00,120
being with other people
apart from you and Kung.

295
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:02,570
I hate myself.

296
00:28:02,570 --> 00:28:06,350
I feel like I'm invisible.

297
00:28:12,420 --> 00:28:14,920
Can I tell you a story?

298
00:28:16,970 --> 00:28:18,920
Last year,

299
00:28:18,920 --> 00:28:21,950
When I joined Drama club,

300
00:28:21,950 --> 00:28:25,370
I met many talented seniors...

301
00:28:25,370 --> 00:28:30,000
who were the main roles
in many plays.

302
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,050
The very beginning when I first joined,

303
00:28:32,050 --> 00:28:35,900
I didn't have any friends
or anyone to talk to.

304
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:37,720
I stayed in the corner,

305
00:28:37,720 --> 00:28:40,470
watching those senior rehearsed.

306
00:28:40,470 --> 00:28:44,170
Helped with the set and some props.

307
00:28:44,170 --> 00:28:46,170
It took me almost a month...

308
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,220
before I got to be an extra role.

309
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:51,700
I think it's completely normal,

310
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:55,550
that we can't be visible everywhere.

311
00:28:56,270 --> 00:28:58,450
But if you wanna be somewhere,

312
00:28:58,450 --> 00:29:01,950
you need to put yourself out there,
find your own place.

313
00:29:01,950 --> 00:29:06,370
Even sometimes it's uncomfortable,
but you have to deal with it.

314
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:08,100
Not everyone's,

315
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:10,450
gonna be happy since the first try.

316
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,320
But...

317
00:29:13,570 --> 00:29:15,320
I don't know where to start, Fee.

318
00:29:17,070 --> 00:29:18,950
Let do this...

319
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:21,520
you wanna try Drama club
with me?

320
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:24,220
Ugh Fee!

321
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:26,950
I can't do it.

322
00:29:26,950 --> 00:29:31,700
See! You need to stop saying
that you can't do it!

323
00:29:31,700 --> 00:29:35,750
You can be afraid, uncomfortable,
or feel bad all you want,

324
00:29:35,750 --> 00:29:37,250
but you can't run away.

325
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,450
You have to face it.

326
00:29:40,450 --> 00:29:44,120
Bring yourself to where
you're not comfortable sometimes.

327
00:29:44,120 --> 00:29:46,220
Adjust yourself a little.

328
00:29:46,220 --> 00:29:49,970
Try learning things that
other people are interested.

329
00:29:49,970 --> 00:29:54,550
Observing what our friends
normally talk about.

330
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:58,850
If you pick up something from that,
you'll have lots to talk about.

331
00:29:59,870 --> 00:30:01,720
I think...

332
00:30:01,720 --> 00:30:03,900
Doing things
that you're not comfortable,

333
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:06,450
is not always that bad.

334
00:30:07,470 --> 00:30:10,950
Um I will try.

335
00:30:13,020 --> 00:30:16,620
Wanna know what's the best tips
I can give you?

336
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:20,270
Here.

337
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,270
Hm?

338
00:30:21,270 --> 00:30:23,120
Smile more.

339
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:27,250
Just smiling, you'll be cuter
and people would want to talk to you more.

340
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:30,000
Not true.

341
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:35,870
Let’s change ourselves, shall we?

342
00:30:35,870 --> 00:30:39,220
Make Cake super amazed
when he’s back, okay?

343
00:30:40,850 --> 00:30:42,350
Um.

344
00:30:42,350 --> 00:30:43,450
Fighting!

345
00:30:45,970 --> 00:30:47,120
Fighting!

346
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:51,200
Ugh
Eiw make more it more confident!

347
00:30:51,200 --> 00:30:54,370
Fighting!

348
00:30:54,470 --> 00:30:55,500
On my count.

349
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,620
1 2 3.

350
00:30:57,620 --> 00:30:58,770
Fighting!!

351
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,500
Evening mom.

352
00:31:07,500 --> 00:31:10,220
Hm. Hurry much?
and you're not gonna eat first?

353
00:31:10,220 --> 00:31:12,520
I will in a bit.
Turn on computer first.

354
00:31:13,070 --> 00:31:15,900
You will fall down the stairs
running like that.

355
00:31:24,570 --> 00:31:27,370
I join Drama club with Fee now.

356
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:30,150
The first day I joined,
I helped them painting the set.

357
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,250
A bit lonely
because Fee had to rehearse.

358
00:31:34,550 --> 00:31:38,400
I mixed the paint with the other girl
from English program.

359
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,800
I tried to smile to her.

360
00:31:39,800 --> 00:31:41,950
She smiled back at me too Cake.

361
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,370
I later learned
that her name is Nink.

362
00:31:43,370 --> 00:31:46,320
I will try to talk to her tomorrow.

363
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:48,220
I heard that she loves eating snacks.

364
00:31:48,220 --> 00:31:51,700
So I might buy her some cupcakes that we used to have.
The one you really like.

365
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:53,570
Still remember?

366
00:32:00,570 --> 00:32:02,700
Cake! I just got a role in the club!

367
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:05,750
Tal just gave me a role to play.
I'm super excited.

368
00:32:05,750 --> 00:32:07,520
We'll perform in November.

369
00:32:07,520 --> 00:32:10,820
We have 3 months
to create the set, props, and rehearse.

370
00:32:10,820 --> 00:32:13,420
Fee was even more
excited than me.

371
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,420
I don't know whether I can do it.

372
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:18,200
I was indecisive at first.

373
00:32:18,200 --> 00:32:20,870
I was gonna reject the role,
and continue with backstage.

374
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:23,220
But then I saw the way
Fee looked at me.

375
00:32:23,220 --> 00:32:25,220
I couldn't turn it down.

376
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:31,650
Oh and there's an internet cafe
opening nearby Uncle O too, Cake.

377
00:32:31,650 --> 00:32:35,100
I walked past the other day,
and I totally thought of you.

378
00:32:35,100 --> 00:32:38,300
Many kids from our school
are there playing everyday.

379
00:32:38,300 --> 00:32:42,600
If you were here, you would probably be there all day
with Ta and friends for sure.

380
00:32:42,600 --> 00:32:45,720
Just thinking about it,
makes me feel lonely.

381
00:32:45,720 --> 00:32:48,370
But if I compare it
to our current situation...

382
00:32:48,370 --> 00:32:50,720
maybe I rather see you
in that internet cafe.

383
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,100
It would have been better that way,
don't you think?

384
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,950
I might be home late these days.

385
00:32:54,950 --> 00:32:56,950
Because I have to rehearse everyday.

386
00:32:56,950 --> 00:33:00,920
But don't worry, I have Tal
because he has to walk pass my place anyway.

387
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:02,900
He walked me home everyday.

388
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,900
This is my house.

389
00:33:04,900 --> 00:33:07,200
Thank you so much.

390
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:09,200
See you at school.

391
00:33:13,500 --> 00:33:16,400
Let's talk about you.
Are you used to the weather now?

392
00:33:16,400 --> 00:33:19,970
I'm happy for you.
When you're back to Thailand,

393
00:33:19,970 --> 00:33:23,070
you will get easily hot
many more times for sure.

394
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:25,420
Take care of yourself.

395
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:27,000
I care about you.

396
00:33:29,050 --> 00:33:30,900
I miss you the same.

397
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:32,320
See-Eiw.

398
00:33:47,500 --> 00:33:48,350
Oh hey brother.

399
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:49,920
I brought you soy milk.

400
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,200
Thanks.

401
00:33:53,150 --> 00:33:54,420
Replying Cake's email?

402
00:33:54,420 --> 00:33:56,420
Yes.

403
00:33:57,450 --> 00:34:00,620
Oh wow he turns into
a foreign kid already.

404
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:06,570
Did you know that people over there
dye their hair regularly?

405
00:34:06,570 --> 00:34:08,250
I'm so worried that...

406
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:10,969
all of his hair might fall off.

407
00:34:10,969 --> 00:34:12,969
But I think it suits him.

408
00:34:16,820 --> 00:34:17,969
Looks cool.

409
00:34:19,969 --> 00:34:22,650
Don't stay up too late Eiw.

410
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,370
You don't get enough sleep lately.

411
00:34:24,370 --> 00:34:26,719
You've got both exams and the play.

412
00:34:26,719 --> 00:34:28,250
You could get sick.

413
00:34:28,250 --> 00:34:29,650
Sure.

414
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,920
I will go straight to bed...

415
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,920
after I finish studying.
Don't worry.

416
00:34:34,920 --> 00:34:36,920
Good.

417
00:34:36,920 --> 00:34:39,320
I'm going to bed now.

418
00:34:39,320 --> 00:34:40,280
Good night, Brother.

419
00:34:40,280 --> 00:34:41,510
Good night.

420
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:58,140
Bro!

421
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,140
What's up?

422
00:35:01,820 --> 00:35:04,940
I dropped my phone in the toilet.

423
00:35:04,940 --> 00:35:06,940
Why did you bring it in
in the first place?

424
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:12,480
It was just on my hands.

425
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:15,480
So when I grabbed the towel,

426
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:18,820
I kinda swiped it
down the toilet.

427
00:35:20,540 --> 00:35:21,600
Stop overreacting!

428
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:22,650
Is it stink?

429
00:35:22,650 --> 00:35:25,540
It's not that bad.
I'm afraid it's gonna be broken.

430
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:28,820
Can you help me?

431
00:35:30,220 --> 00:35:32,280
Looks like it's not gonna work.

432
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:33,970
Really?

433
00:35:33,970 --> 00:35:36,080
But you've been using this one
for so many years.

434
00:35:36,310 --> 00:35:37,770
maybe it's time for a new phone?

435
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,480
No. No.

436
00:35:39,480 --> 00:35:43,080
This one mom bought it for me
to use with Cake.

437
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:45,710
Yeah but you can't fix this one.

438
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,850
Keep it as a souvenir then.

439
00:35:52,680 --> 00:35:54,480
That's okay.

440
00:35:56,370 --> 00:35:59,200
And...have you talked to Cake lately?

441
00:36:01,340 --> 00:36:03,570
Not as much.

442
00:36:03,570 --> 00:36:05,820
By the time I get home,
it's already late.

443
00:36:06,140 --> 00:36:08,200
I'm too tired
to turn on the computer.

444
00:36:09,540 --> 00:36:11,970
So you've been super busy.

445
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:14,420
You should rest too.

446
00:36:15,910 --> 00:36:17,820
Your under eyes
are like panda already.

447
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:20,600
You're exaggerating.
It's not that dark.

448
00:36:22,420 --> 00:36:23,770
What can I do?

449
00:36:24,310 --> 00:36:26,250
It's my first play.

450
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:28,310
I want it
to turn out the best I can.

451
00:36:28,310 --> 00:36:31,280
Everyone is super determined
about this.

452
00:36:32,110 --> 00:36:33,770
Then you need to be one of them too!

453
00:36:33,770 --> 00:36:34,800
-Um.
-Understand?

454
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:39,000
If there's anything that I could help,
please tell me anytime.

455
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:46,170
Can you help fixing my phone
and make it work like before?

456
00:36:46,450 --> 00:36:48,400
-Except this!
- Hey!

457
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,620
It can't be fixed, Eiw.

458
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,940
Can you ask the shop first?

459
00:36:50,940 --> 00:36:53,250
- It might work.
- You've been using for so long already.

460
00:36:53,540 --> 00:36:55,080
I will ask mom for a new one.

461
00:36:55,080 --> 00:36:56,000
Okay?

462
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,620
Always!

463
00:36:59,080 --> 00:37:01,280
Come here.

464
00:37:01,280 --> 00:37:03,050
- I can eat by myself. I'm not a kid.
- Open your mouth.

465
00:37:03,050 --> 00:37:05,050
I'm a grown man, brother.

466
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,370
Let me feed you.
That's ok.

467
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,200
It's good.

468
00:37:23,940 --> 00:37:25,820
That one is silly.

469
00:37:29,450 --> 00:37:31,250
Yeah.

470
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,200
Thank you. Thank you.

471
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:44,050
Hey.

472
00:37:44,050 --> 00:37:46,050
Palm. Ta. Peak.

473
00:37:46,050 --> 00:37:47,910
Thank you for today.

474
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,020
We have to be here right?

475
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:49,650
Yeah.

476
00:37:49,650 --> 00:37:50,910
It's fine.

477
00:37:50,910 --> 00:37:52,250
We are here to see you for Cake.

478
00:37:52,250 --> 00:37:55,220
And also taking pictures for him too.
I got quite a lot.

479
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:57,110
Congratulations Eiw.

480
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:58,600
- Thank you so much.
- You were so great.

481
00:37:58,600 --> 00:38:00,310
Thank you. Thank you.

482
00:38:00,910 --> 00:38:05,400
I'm great,
but maybe not as great as my sister?

483
00:38:07,770 --> 00:38:10,170
But really, the last scene
you were so good.

484
00:38:10,170 --> 00:38:12,250
I was in tears.

485
00:38:12,250 --> 00:38:13,140
Really?

486
00:38:13,140 --> 00:38:14,220
Yeah.

487
00:38:14,220 --> 00:38:15,740
Thank you so much.

488
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:18,050
I'm so glad you guys are here today.

489
00:38:18,050 --> 00:38:21,510
How can we miss it?
Trust me Cake is dying to see you.

490
00:38:21,510 --> 00:38:22,680
- Right?
- Yeah.

491
00:38:24,800 --> 00:38:27,020
Me too...

492
00:38:30,510 --> 00:38:31,770
Shall we take some pics?

493
00:38:31,770 --> 00:38:32,510
Sure.

494
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:33,110
Here.

495
00:38:33,110 --> 00:38:34,050
Let's do it.

496
00:38:34,050 --> 00:38:35,910
Toffee, Kung.

497
00:38:35,910 --> 00:38:36,600
Come here.

498
00:38:36,800 --> 00:38:38,110
Let's take pictures.

499
00:38:38,940 --> 00:38:40,140
Congrats!

500
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:44,140
Ok 1 2 3!

501
00:38:45,020 --> 00:38:46,140
One more.

502
00:38:46,140 --> 00:38:47,910
No need for other to take.
I'll just do it

503
00:38:48,200 --> 00:38:52,000

505
00:38:55,370 --> 00:38:57,140
Finally it's over.

506
00:38:57,140 --> 00:38:59,140
So it's close to the time then.

507
00:38:59,140 --> 00:39:01,680
Aunty Nate made too many food, Eiw.

508
00:39:01,680 --> 00:39:03,000

509
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:04,940
Mom made this for us.

00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:15,000
No, that's crumbs.

514
00:39:15,000 --> 00:39:16,820
Should we turn on the TV?
It's already midnight.

515
00:39:16,820 --> 00:39:19,800
Yes. I'll turn it on for you.

516
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:27,820
-Hey! It's here.
-You scared me.

517
00:39:27,820 --> 00:39:29,200
Come on. Come on.

518
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:29,940
I'm excited.

519
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,110
So excited!

520
00:39:32,740 --> 00:39:33,510

521
00:39:33,510 --> 00:39:34,050
Shhh. Quiet.

522
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:36,340
Ready to count?

523
00:39:36,340 --> 00:39:37,820

00:39:41,570 --> 00:39:42,680

528
00:39:42,680 --> 00:39:43,880

529
00:39:43,880 --> 00:39:44,910

00:39:44,910 --> 00:39:45,880

531
00:39:45,880 --> 00:39:46,970

00:39:48,570 --> 00:39:51,200
Happy new year!

535
00:39:55,170 --> 00:39:57,220
Happy new year Cake!

536
00:39:57,220 --> 00:39:59,370
Let's counting down like this
again next year.

537
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,800
I love counting down with you!

538
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,770
If you love it then
keep it like this forever okay?

539
00:40:04,770 --> 00:40:05,600
Ok.

540
00:40:05,600 --> 00:40:07,970
Where're you gonna go?
Our houses are next to each other.

541
00:40:08,770 --> 00:40:09,970
Let's do this every year!

542
00:40:09,970 --> 00:40:12,400
Sure.
Let's do this every year.

543
00:40:12,400 --> 00:40:14,310

544
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:15,770
Yeah!

545
00:40:15,770 --> 00:40:17,770
Happy new year!

546
00:40:17,770 --> 00:40:19,770
Let's do this again next year!

547
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:31,620
Fee. Kung.
I'm gonna go now. See you.

548
00:40:34,760 --> 00:40:37,000
Can you please help me study me math, Kung?

549
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,620
Hey you guys.

550
00:40:38,620 --> 00:40:41,850
Which country is Pisa tower located question,

551
00:40:41,850 --> 00:40:42,400
Shit.

552
00:40:42,400 --> 00:40:43,480
I was not sure.

553
00:40:43,480 --> 00:40:44,800
But I put England.

554
00:40:44,800 --> 00:40:47,850
You'r so dumb!
It's France.

555
00:40:47,850 --> 00:40:49,020
Shit!

556
00:40:49,020 --> 00:40:51,970
Peak. You're so good.

557
00:40:52,400 --> 00:40:54,450
Yeah. You're real good.

558
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,450
Let's go the internet cafe is on me.

559
00:40:56,450 --> 00:40:57,680
That's my friend!

560
00:40:57,680 --> 00:40:59,110
-Let's go.
-Go!

561
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:01,110
Go go.

562
00:41:04,850 --> 00:41:07,620
Just a blink of an eye,
we've finished high school already.

563
00:41:08,850 --> 00:41:12,250
Yeah time just flies so fast.

564
00:41:13,910 --> 00:41:16,400
I feel like we just started school yesterday.

565
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,600
The bus is here.

566
00:41:23,600 --> 00:41:24,910
I'm going then.

567
00:41:24,910 --> 00:41:26,280
Um.

568
00:41:29,570 --> 00:41:30,650
Get home safely Eiw.

569
00:41:30,650 --> 00:41:32,650
You too Fee.

570
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,910
Can I have a hug before I go?

571
00:41:36,510 --> 00:41:39,450
See you.

572
00:41:39,450 --> 00:41:40,050
Bye bye.

573
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:40,800
- Get home safely
- Before it's gonna rain.

574
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:42,000
Bye bye.

575
00:41:42,820 --> 00:41:44,170
Bye bye.

576
00:41:46,880 --> 00:41:49,510
Just a blink of an eye,
we already finished high school.

577
00:41:49,510 --> 00:41:53,080
It just makes me think of the first day
we started 7th grade together.

578
00:41:53,080 --> 00:41:55,220
I remember...

579
00:41:55,220 --> 00:41:57,340
that I didn't wanna go to school at all.

580
00:41:57,340 --> 00:42:00,620
I was hugging you so tight
and didn't wanna leave the house.

581
00:42:00,620 --> 00:42:03,250
Changing school is something
I'm always nervous about.

582
00:42:03,250 --> 00:42:06,020
New place. New teachers.

583
00:42:06,020 --> 00:42:09,340
New friends. Everything is new.

584
00:42:09,340 --> 00:42:12,250
But luckily I had you.

585
00:42:12,250 --> 00:42:14,510
I have always had you with me.

586
00:42:14,510 --> 00:42:18,600
I actually wish we could spend
all 6 years in high school together.

587
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:21,480
I wanted us to have some fun together.

588
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,310
and I also wanted us to graduate together.

589
00:42:24,310 --> 00:42:27,140
I don't know why
I was a coward back then.

590
00:42:27,140 --> 00:42:30,250
So that made me miss
so many good opportunities.

591
00:42:30,250 --> 00:42:34,770
I should have walked in
the school with you,

592
00:42:34,770 --> 00:42:36,600
been in the line up with you,

593
00:42:36,600 --> 00:42:38,850
sat with you in the class,

594
00:42:38,850 --> 00:42:41,080
eaten with you,

595
00:42:41,080 --> 00:42:43,910
done more activities with you,

596
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,540
watched you play football,

597
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:50,080
instead of running away
and avoiding you like I've always done.

598
00:42:50,080 --> 00:42:52,940
If I could turn back time...

599
00:42:52,940 --> 00:42:56,020
I would've done things differently.

600
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:59,000
But I cannot.

601
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:03,600
that's why I'm trying to do things
I should've done long ago.

602
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,940
From now on,

603
00:43:07,370 --> 00:43:11,020
I really want you to be proud of me.

604
00:43:11,020 --> 00:43:14,450
If you read this email
and you could smile,

605
00:43:14,450 --> 00:43:17,280
that would already make me so happy.

606
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:19,680
I would love to see you
as soon as possible.

607
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:23,400
Even 1 hour earlier
is more than enough.

608
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:28,820
I miss you up to the point
where the word 'miss' is not enough
to describe how much I miss you.

609
00:43:28,820 --> 00:43:31,200
The new See-Eiw.

610
00:43:47,840 --> 00:43:49,950
Cake come on! We'll be late.

611
00:43:49,950 --> 00:43:52,620
Cake we're late. Come on!!

612
00:43:53,310 --> 00:43:55,860
Let me grab my stuff real quick.

613
00:44:11,800 --> 00:44:13,280
Hi Eiw.

614
00:44:14,930 --> 00:44:17,600
Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake.

615
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:22,460
Answer me.

616
00:44:22,460 --> 00:44:24,460
Keep answering me.

617
00:44:26,570 --> 00:44:28,330
Please answer me every time I call you.

618
00:44:29,480 --> 00:44:30,970
Who is this?

619
00:44:30,970 --> 00:44:33,240
Oh Cake, tomorrow after school...

620
00:44:33,240 --> 00:44:35,460
I'll be a model for Tal to take some pictures.
