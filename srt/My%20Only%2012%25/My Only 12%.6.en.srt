1
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,100
You're home late.

2
00:00:21,100 --> 00:00:23,100
That's nonsense.

3
00:00:23,710 --> 00:00:25,850
It's not even 7pm.

4
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,470
Since when you turn into
a trouble kid?

5
00:00:29,830 --> 00:00:31,690
I'm not.

6
00:00:31,690 --> 00:00:33,460
This is my first time.

7
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:36,620
Normally it's you who always stay out,
so we get home late.

8
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,600
But I never let you
go home alone.

9
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,720
I'm kidding.

10
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:06,720
Go take a shower.

11
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:08,210
Um.

12
00:01:09,150 --> 00:01:10,570
I will.

13
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,930
Are you staying here tonight?

14
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:16,820
Go take a shower.
Put you bag here.

15
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:19,220
- Go shower.
- Ok. I know.

16
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:23,360
Hurry. Hurry up.

17
00:01:28,430 --> 00:01:30,380
Hello?

18
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:34,630
What are you doing Rin?

19
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:49,300
Hello?

20
00:01:57,170 --> 00:01:59,289
I don't have any homework today.

21
00:02:03,590 --> 00:02:05,770
What?
You're going to sleep already?

22
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:08,740
What about you?
Any homework today?

23
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:14,010
Yes.

24
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:18,270
Are you going to sleep Eiw?

25
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:20,270
Yeah I am.

26
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:23,180
Why so early today?

27
00:02:24,260 --> 00:02:27,010
I'm exhausted.
Been playing all day.

28
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,010
So...

29
00:02:29,460 --> 00:02:31,870
I haven't seen you put money
in the piggy bank lately.

30
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:34,170
Um.

31
00:02:34,170 --> 00:02:36,579
Sand took me to try
so many food.

32
00:02:36,579 --> 00:02:38,880
So I bought some snacks
for his brothers too.

33
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:41,950
His siblings are so tiny.
Very adorable.

34
00:02:41,950 --> 00:02:43,950
They're so full of energy.

35
00:02:44,990 --> 00:02:47,090
What did you do with them?

36
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,600
Umm...I did climb the trees.

37
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,200
- Climbing trees??
-Yeah.

38
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:53,500
What?

39
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,960
His brother took me to
the mango trees.

40
00:02:59,060 --> 00:03:01,440
How come you're adventurous?

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:04,660
I always asked you to go out,
but you never come with me.

42
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,660
But you went with someone else.

43
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:11,460
Why are you
so cruel to me?

44
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:15,150
Hey because you wouldn't play
the same way they did.

45
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:18,700
Sand also took me to
a Pad Thai place.

46
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,470
The omelette wrapping kind.
It's so good.

47
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,820
And...

48
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,820
Is there any for me?

49
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:30,450
I ran out of the money.

50
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:34,829
I will take you there
next time instead.

51
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:45,920
Are you mad at me?

52
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:46,920
Hm?

53
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,840
I'm not.

54
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:52,840
How can I be?

55
00:03:53,610 --> 00:03:56,230
Cause I haven't been
with you lately.

56
00:03:56,230 --> 00:03:58,230
Also get home late.

57
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:00,230
Let you be by yourself a lot.

58
00:04:00,230 --> 00:04:02,230
I'm not mad.

59
00:04:02,230 --> 00:04:04,230
What are you talking about?

60
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:07,190
I don't hang with you as much.

61
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:12,160
I'm not mad.
If you don't believe me
why would you ask me?

62
00:04:12,740 --> 00:04:14,140
See.

63
00:04:14,140 --> 00:04:16,350
You're avoiding my eye-contact.

64
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:18,350
100% mad for sure.

65
00:04:31,670 --> 00:04:33,970
I'm looking at you right now.

66
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,010
Do you feel lonely?

67
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:45,390
No, I don't

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:48,730
I've got Sand
as my friend now.

69
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:51,640
I thought you only need me
and that's enough?

70
00:04:52,690 --> 00:04:54,110
It's not enough now, isn't it?

71
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:55,400
No.

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:01,910
Yeah...

73
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:05,020
- I'm not important anymore.
- You are.

74
00:05:09,550 --> 00:05:11,660
I wanna go to sleep.

75
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,660
Wanna sleep?

76
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:26,400
Sweet dream, Eiw.

77
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:28,890
You too, Cake.

78
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:33,690
- I've gotta go.
- Ok, see you.

79
00:07:33,690 --> 00:07:34,990
Bye bye.

80
00:07:38,909 --> 00:07:41,430
Hey I'm gonna go reserve
the football field.

81
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:43,350
Are you joining us, Cake?

82
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:45,350
Probably not.

83
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,400
Let me know
when you're about to go home.

84
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,390
Sure.

85
00:07:49,390 --> 00:07:51,390
Why do you have to
go to my place so often?

86
00:07:51,390 --> 00:07:54,550
I used to invite you over,
but you were always too lazy to come.

87
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,850
I love my friend.
Can't I just wanna hang with my friend?

88
00:07:56,850 --> 00:07:58,850
Stop it.
I know what you're up to.

89
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:00,850
- I know.
- Shut up.

90
00:08:04,170 --> 00:08:06,030
Are you gonna come or not?

91
00:08:06,150 --> 00:08:08,360
- See you.
- Bye.

92
00:08:10,150 --> 00:08:11,150
Let's go.

93
00:08:14,150 --> 00:08:16,100
Are you going to see Rin?

94
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:18,100
Yeah why?

95
00:08:18,430 --> 00:08:21,040
Peak has been complaining...

96
00:08:21,040 --> 00:08:23,040
cause you don't hang
with us lately.

97
00:08:23,380 --> 00:08:25,040
You're always with your girlfriend.

98
00:08:25,810 --> 00:08:27,940
You disappear
during lunch and after school.

99
00:08:27,940 --> 00:08:29,940
Probably don't
play football with us anymore?

100
00:08:30,530 --> 00:08:32,650
I probably won't be playing
with you guys.

101
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:34,250
Rin's been complaining too...

102
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:36,250
that I'm too sweaty because of that.

103
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:38,250
Why is she complaining?

104
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:40,250
She probably doesn't like
the sweat.

105
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:42,530
I get too hot easily too.

106
00:08:42,530 --> 00:08:43,570
You have to be sweaty...

107
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:45,570
when you play football,
isn't that normal?

108
00:08:49,910 --> 00:08:51,400
What about...

109
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
See-Eiw...is he mad at you?

110
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,790
I don't know.

111
00:08:57,160 --> 00:08:59,080
I think he is.

112
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,080
We never really stay apart.

113
00:09:01,290 --> 00:09:03,320
He doesn't hang with me anymore
after he gets home.

114
00:09:04,430 --> 00:09:05,730
So what happened?

115
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:09,650
He probably enjoys his new friend.

116
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,480
And forget
the old one already.

117
00:09:11,480 --> 00:09:13,040
Wait...

118
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:14,600
I think...

119
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:17,680
that one who is upset
...is you!

120
00:09:18,280 --> 00:09:21,170
Stop it.
Are you on my side or not?

121
00:09:21,170 --> 00:09:24,010
You're always like this
when you can't argue with me.

122
00:09:24,010 --> 00:09:26,010
I think you're the one
who's mad at him.

123
00:09:29,010 --> 00:09:31,240
Well...have you met his new friend?

124
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,760
I haven't actualy.

125
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:36,760
I feel like he doesn't want me
to get to know the guy.

126
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:40,470
I guess...

127
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:42,740
he doesn't want you to bother
their relationship?

128
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,740
He seems like
a super private person.

129
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:47,380
Does he have to be
private with me?

130
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:49,380
You're being private too.

131
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:51,380
- Me?
- Yeah.

132
00:09:51,380 --> 00:09:54,990
It's about Rin,
your girlfriend it is.

133
00:09:55,850 --> 00:09:57,530
Let's just go.

134
00:09:57,530 --> 00:09:59,530
Don't you have to go see Rin?

135
00:10:12,260 --> 00:10:14,300
I will go play football then.

136
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:15,650
Ok. See you.

137
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:17,350
Bye. I'm gone.

138
00:10:17,350 --> 00:10:19,060
Cake!

139
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:21,060
- Hey!
- You're going home?

140
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:23,060
- You're gonna go see your girlfriend?
- Yeah.

141
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,060
What about Eiw?

142
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:28,460
Probably went with Sand,
just like any other days.

143
00:10:29,800 --> 00:10:31,490
I gotta go.

144
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:32,490
See ya.

145
00:10:33,080 --> 00:10:35,510
Hey can I ask you a question?

146
00:10:36,170 --> 00:10:38,290
Have you met this guy?

147
00:10:39,870 --> 00:10:41,510
Sand?

148
00:10:41,510 --> 00:10:43,510
Once. Why?

149
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:46,520
How was it?
Is he okay?

150
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:50,460
I've never met him.
Eiw doesn't let me see him.

151
00:10:52,460 --> 00:10:55,120
You don't have the time
yourself, probably?

152
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:56,700
Hey are you blaming me?

153
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,700
No I'm not.
Why would I do that?

154
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:00,700
I just said
what I've noticed.

155
00:11:02,700 --> 00:11:05,460
I only see her
after school for a couple of hrs.

156
00:11:05,460 --> 00:11:07,460
And this is not even enough for her.

157
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:09,460
What do you want me to do?

158
00:11:11,560 --> 00:11:14,170
You seem to love Rin so much.

159
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:16,170
At the end,
she's my girlfriend, right?

160
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,480
Why are you looking at me
like that?

161
00:11:22,650 --> 00:11:24,480
Nothing.

162
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:26,480
Love each other well.

163
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:30,880
Hey! Why're you
giving me a blessing?

164
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:32,880
That's weird.
I'm having goosebump.

165
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:35,540
I'm gonna get going now.

166
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:38,310
Hurry back home,

167
00:11:38,310 --> 00:11:39,780
after spending time with your girl.

168
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,160
Ok.

169
00:11:41,160 --> 00:11:44,250
- See ya.
- See you. Get home safely.

170
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,850
Sand.

171
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,440
Sand?

172
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:14,660
Sand?

173
00:12:15,050 --> 00:12:16,660
Huh what's up?

174
00:12:16,660 --> 00:12:18,660
Are you alright?

175
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:20,370
Are you stressed?

176
00:12:20,370 --> 00:12:22,370
I saw you were absent-minded.

177
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:25,560
It's nothing.

178
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:30,380
If you have something's goin' on,
you can always tell me.

179
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,750
If I can help, I totally would.

180
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,350
Actually...

181
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:48,350
I've got a little problem at home.

182
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,840
I don't know what's wrong
with my dad's boss.

183
00:12:52,840 --> 00:12:54,840
He said that his boss
will pay his salary late.

184
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:59,120
And it's time to pay
for the rent already.

185
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:01,120
We've been postponing
for so many months.

186
00:13:01,650 --> 00:13:04,910
The landlord'll kick us out
because of that.

187
00:13:06,910 --> 00:13:10,120
We don't have much saving too.

188
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:12,120
Even if we combine all we have,
still not enough.

189
00:13:13,950 --> 00:13:16,550
My dad is so stressed right now.

190
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:20,290
Because it's another 3 more days
until he'll get paid.

191
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,060
Then...

192
00:13:25,060 --> 00:13:26,600
do you wanna borrow me?

193
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,900
Hey!

194
00:13:28,840 --> 00:13:30,570
That's fine.

195
00:13:30,570 --> 00:13:31,480
I don't wanna inconvenience you.

196
00:13:31,480 --> 00:13:34,020
It's okay.
I wanna help.

197
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:36,550
It might not be a lot,
but from I've counted last time...

198
00:13:36,550 --> 00:13:38,550
it should be around 5,000 Baht.

199
00:13:38,550 --> 00:13:40,550
Don't know whether it's enough
for the rent?

200
00:13:40,730 --> 00:13:42,550
That's enough.

201
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:47,920
My rent is 10,000.

202
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,870
If I combine all the saving,
I might have a few thousands.

203
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:53,910
Plus yours, another 5,000,
that should be enough.

204
00:13:53,910 --> 00:13:56,570
I'll bring it to you tomorrow then.

205
00:13:56,570 --> 00:13:58,570
Thank you so much.

206
00:13:58,570 --> 00:14:00,570
As soon my dad gets paid,

207
00:14:01,240 --> 00:14:03,260
I will pay you back immediately.

208
00:14:03,780 --> 00:14:06,610
That's fine.
Just pay me when he gets paid.

209
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:07,530
I don't need to use it
anytime soon.

210
00:14:07,530 --> 00:14:09,530
Thank you so much.
Really.

211
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:11,200
Um.

212
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,020
It's fine.
We're friends.

213
00:14:15,470 --> 00:14:16,960
You want some?

214
00:14:16,960 --> 00:14:18,960
No. You go ahead.

215
00:14:19,310 --> 00:14:21,350
The swing is empty now.
Let's go play.

216
00:14:33,940 --> 00:14:35,430
You guys are now messing around.

217
00:14:35,430 --> 00:14:37,430
Do you job!

218
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:42,090
This one?

219
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:44,090
This should be a rehearsal.

220
00:14:44,090 --> 00:14:46,440
- Could be.
- We will rehearse main characters first.

221
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:48,720
- Oh sure.
- We'll do the scene where they confess their love.

222
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:50,720
Oh. ok.

223
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:52,870
Err...the main actor hasn't arrived yet.

224
00:14:52,870 --> 00:14:54,490
What?

225
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:56,490
That's okay.
We'll rehearse her first then.

226
00:14:57,370 --> 00:14:59,410
Who's free to help rehearse with her?

227
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,920
- That guy. Come!
- Yes.

228
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:04,060
Get up.

229
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,390
You're almost the main actor,
my friend.

230
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:16,390
Here.

231
00:15:16,730 --> 00:15:18,390
Pick up a little pieces of your face.
(Broken face means embarrassment)

232
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:20,900
Let me fix it for you.

233
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:22,900
Hey! Leave me alone.

234
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,620
- Take him down.
- Do it.

235
00:15:33,730 --> 00:15:35,310
Did that hurt?

236
00:15:36,900 --> 00:15:37,970
Who are those 3 guys?

237
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:39,970
That's been helping with the scene?

238
00:15:40,370 --> 00:15:43,190
Probably someone from our faculty
asked them for help.

239
00:15:43,190 --> 00:15:44,390
They're so cute.

240
00:15:44,390 --> 00:15:46,060
One of them is exactly my type.

241
00:15:46,060 --> 00:15:46,860
You're too much.

242
00:15:46,860 --> 00:15:48,860
University and junior high student?

243
00:15:48,860 --> 00:15:50,860
That's nasty.
Wake up girl.

244
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:52,860
Do you wanna be in jail?

245
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,660
Cops come arrest her!

246
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,300
Let's go rehearse.

247
00:16:26,780 --> 00:16:28,930
- How long have you been here?
- Awhile.

248
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:30,930
- You're early!
- Hi.

249
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,570
I left you waiting.

250
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:37,170
What shall we eat?

251
00:16:37,170 --> 00:16:39,170
- Who's paying?
- Not me.

252
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:41,170
I worked on the whole thing.
You pay.

253
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,730
Who's that?

254
00:16:47,500 --> 00:16:49,560
I don't know.
Never seen him before.

255
00:16:51,490 --> 00:16:53,930
I think he's trying
to go out with her.

256
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:55,930
True.

257
00:16:55,930 --> 00:16:58,630
Damn!
Look at his eye-contact.

258
00:16:58,970 --> 00:17:00,630
So sweet.

259
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:03,960
You're pissed.

260
00:17:03,960 --> 00:17:05,960
Thought you don't like her.

261
00:17:06,609 --> 00:17:08,480
None of your business.

262
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:09,780
So aggressive.

263
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:16,339
- Smile please.
- F*ck you.

264
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:18,040
Smile please.

265
00:17:18,040 --> 00:17:19,450
Are you guys in a rush?

266
00:17:19,450 --> 00:17:22,410
Hom and I wanna invite you guys for dinner,
you wanna join?

267
00:17:22,410 --> 00:17:25,980
Not at all.
We're always available for free meal.

268
00:17:26,599 --> 00:17:27,980
Great!

269
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:29,980
We've got someone to pay.

270
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,670
Anyways...

271
00:17:35,930 --> 00:17:37,670
who's that?

272
00:17:37,670 --> 00:17:39,670
Oh. That's Jim.

273
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:41,260
A senior from my faculty.

274
00:17:41,260 --> 00:17:44,250
He'll be the one
driving us to eat.

275
00:17:47,410 --> 00:17:49,620
Is he dating--

276
00:17:50,730 --> 00:17:52,240
You're talking too much.

277
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,210
Don't let me be the one who say it.

278
00:17:55,210 --> 00:17:57,210
Let's go eat.

279
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:58,680
Thank you.

280
00:17:58,680 --> 00:18:00,140
Stop trying to take my hands off.

281
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:00,730
Let's go.

282
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:03,250
- Shut your mouth.
- Cake! Bullying your friend again.

283
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:05,250
Come on.
Stop messing around.

284
00:18:11,910 --> 00:18:14,330
"PP Suki Buffet"

285
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,630
Cake.

286
00:18:55,020 --> 00:18:56,440
Cake.

287
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,920
- Cake.
- Ahh.

288
00:19:11,030 --> 00:19:13,210
My ears are ringing.

289
00:19:13,210 --> 00:19:15,050
What are you trying to do?

290
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:17,050
When will you wake up easily?

291
00:19:18,360 --> 00:19:19,260
Huh?

292
00:19:19,630 --> 00:19:20,500
Still being foolish?

293
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,380
When will you wake up easily
like other people?

294
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,700
What I can't hear you?

295
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:25,680
Stop being silly!

296
00:19:25,680 --> 00:19:27,200
I can't hear you.
I'm going back to sleep.

297
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,710
Cake wake up!
Get up now.

298
00:19:30,900 --> 00:19:32,370
I slept late last night.

299
00:19:32,370 --> 00:19:34,090
How is that relevant?

300
00:19:34,090 --> 00:19:37,250
If you went to bed early,
you could definitely get up early.

301
00:19:37,250 --> 00:19:41,020
- Come on get up.
- Even I go to bed early,
I wouldn't be able to wake up anyway.

302
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:44,380
See. Still closing your eyes
and talk.

303
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:46,380
Get up!

304
00:19:49,210 --> 00:19:52,270
Waking you up is
the hardest thing in the world.

305
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:53,570
So you stop...

306
00:19:53,570 --> 00:19:55,570
jumping on me
to wake me up?

307
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,090
Yeah. You told me yourself
you don't want me to do it.

308
00:19:59,090 --> 00:20:01,330
I was just kidding.

309
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:03,860
You're so tiny,
you couldn't hurt me.

310
00:20:03,860 --> 00:20:05,860
Stop teasing me.

311
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,960
Watch me. Next year...

312
00:20:07,960 --> 00:20:09,960
I will gain weight
catching up with you.

313
00:20:09,960 --> 00:20:11,230
Yess.

314
00:20:11,230 --> 00:20:13,230
You said this since last year.

315
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:15,470
You're still tiny.

316
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,470
Go take a shower go.

317
00:20:19,260 --> 00:20:20,480
Sure.

318
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:29,440
Grab your towel.

319
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:31,760
"Proud's Bakery"

320
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:32,720
Ow.

321
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
When will you get up easily
like other people?

322
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:36,720
- Stop teasing me.
- Bla bla bla. Complaining.

323
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,720
You're always difficult to wake up.

324
00:20:40,360 --> 00:20:41,120
Yeah well...

325
00:20:42,460 --> 00:20:43,860
Next time I will just go by myself.

326
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,860
Bla bla bla.

327
00:20:46,330 --> 00:20:48,530
You're the most difficult person
in the world to wake up.

328
00:20:49,450 --> 00:20:52,150
Why did you guys
come down so late today?

329
00:20:52,150 --> 00:20:53,150
Hm?

330
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:54,720
It's Cake, aunty Proud.

331
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,560
He didn't get up.
So difficult to wake up.

332
00:20:59,110 --> 00:21:01,410
You stay up all night...

333
00:21:01,410 --> 00:21:03,050
And in the morning,
you wouldn't wake up.

334
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:05,050
Next time you need
to leave him behind.

335
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:08,710
The person who will regret this
is not me, mom.

336
00:21:08,710 --> 00:21:12,080
It should be baby Eiw.

337
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:14,440
- Who's the baby?
- If you take the bus alone, you'll be squeezed.

338
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:16,440
Yeah you 're saying all these...

339
00:21:17,050 --> 00:21:18,950
One day, if he doesn't
wake you up anymore...

340
00:21:18,950 --> 00:21:20,950
you'll be the one who regrets this.

341
00:21:20,950 --> 00:21:23,890
I was just joking mom!

342
00:21:23,890 --> 00:21:25,890
I'm off to school now.
Don't wanna be late.

343
00:21:25,890 --> 00:21:27,890
We're leaving then aunty Proud.

344
00:21:27,890 --> 00:21:29,030
Bye.

345
00:21:29,030 --> 00:21:32,500
Cake, can I talk to you for a min?

346
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:35,850
See-Eiw, go wait for him out front.
I'll be quick.

347
00:21:35,850 --> 00:21:37,850
Sure.

348
00:22:00,430 --> 00:22:02,940
Come on, Cake.

349
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,940
I wanna catch this bus.
Hurry!

350
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:10,470
The bus is almost here.

351
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:18,210
- What's wrong?
- Hm?

352
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:20,210
Nothing.

353
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:27,650
The bus is here.
Come!

354
00:22:27,650 --> 00:22:29,650
Come on.
Why're you standing still?

355
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,450
- Cake.
- Hm?

356
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,100
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

357
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:20,990
Y = X+1.

358
00:23:20,990 --> 00:23:28,040
and Y = X+2X-2

359
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,960
So X = -1.

360
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,740
You'll get an intersection on
X-axis which is -1 = 0.

361
00:23:37,740 --> 00:23:39,740
Considering...

362
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,860
Students, class is over.

363
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:51,670
Thank you teacher.

364
00:23:56,210 --> 00:23:59,940
Fee, Kung I'll follow you guys in a bit.
Go ahead and eat first.

365
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:02,070
What shall we have?

366
00:24:03,790 --> 00:24:06,760
Help me think what should we eat?

367
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,470
Cake.

368
00:24:17,330 --> 00:24:18,470
Hm?

369
00:24:19,010 --> 00:24:21,300
Why are you walking to me?
That's a little weird.

370
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:26,390
It's you!

371
00:24:26,390 --> 00:24:28,390
You were absent-minded the whole day.

372
00:24:29,860 --> 00:24:31,600
Are you nagging me?

373
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:33,600
No.

374
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,600
I'm just worried about you.

375
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:37,600
Are you alright, Cake?

376
00:24:40,240 --> 00:24:42,030
Let's just talk about this at home.

377
00:24:43,590 --> 00:24:46,240
I will sleep over at yours tonight.

378
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:48,240
Um. Ok.

379
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,350
Look at you.

380
00:24:52,350 --> 00:24:54,350
I'm just worried.

381
00:24:57,990 --> 00:25:00,540
I heard you.
Why don't you go have lunch?

382
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:02,540
Why don't you go to have lunch too?

383
00:25:02,540 --> 00:25:05,450
Normally you'd run out of the room
before the bell even rings.

384
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:09,840
I will go soon.

385
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,620
You go ahead.
Kung is waiting for you.

386
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:18,620
I'm going for lunch then.

387
00:25:18,620 --> 00:25:20,620
Eat a lot ok?

388
00:25:21,080 --> 00:25:23,030
You too.

389
00:25:23,030 --> 00:25:25,430
I know. I'm off.

390
00:25:25,430 --> 00:25:27,430
Bye bye.

391
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:34,160
Did he even see us here?

392
00:25:34,160 --> 00:25:36,160
We're like just an air to him.

393
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:38,900
F*ck off.

394
00:25:39,870 --> 00:25:41,810
What the hell is wrong with you though?

395
00:25:41,810 --> 00:25:44,180
You act like your soul is somewhere else
since this morning.

396
00:25:52,550 --> 00:25:54,030
You're different.

397
00:25:54,030 --> 00:25:56,030
You try and eat new menus.

398
00:25:56,030 --> 00:25:57,650
Normally you just eat the same thing.

399
00:25:57,650 --> 00:25:59,650
Sand took me
to try new things a lot.

400
00:25:59,650 --> 00:26:01,500
That's why I get to try
many new stuff.

401
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:04,870
Do you still
hanging out with him?

402
00:26:04,870 --> 00:26:06,870
You haven't talked about him
for awhile.

403
00:26:08,440 --> 00:26:10,460
I don't know where's he been.

404
00:26:10,460 --> 00:26:12,590
I haven't seen him
for many days too.

405
00:26:12,590 --> 00:26:16,120
I've been waiting for him at
the 2nd bus stop as always after school.

406
00:26:16,120 --> 00:26:18,120
But he never showed up.

407
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,120
- Maybe he didn't come to school?
- Yeah.

408
00:26:20,820 --> 00:26:24,810
I don't know.
I never really see him at school either.

409
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:28,130
You guys are in different building?

410
00:26:28,130 --> 00:26:30,130
Could be.

411
00:26:30,130 --> 00:26:32,810
Hey which class is Sand in?

412
00:26:32,810 --> 00:26:34,100
Class 7.

413
00:26:34,100 --> 00:26:36,100
Class 7...

414
00:26:36,530 --> 00:26:38,100
Same class with Pum?

415
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:39,480
I will ask Pum for you.

416
00:26:39,480 --> 00:26:41,480
Really!?
Thank you!

417
00:26:46,200 --> 00:26:47,520
Hey.

418
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:49,350
Why are you so stressed?

419
00:26:49,350 --> 00:26:51,630
- Your eyebrows almost combine into one.
- Um.

420
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:55,410
Ugh.

421
00:26:55,410 --> 00:26:57,410
I'm just worried a little.

422
00:26:58,010 --> 00:27:00,700
Sand told me
he has a problem at home too.

423
00:27:00,700 --> 00:27:02,700
Normally we see each other everyday.

424
00:27:02,700 --> 00:27:04,700
He disappeared like this...

425
00:27:05,370 --> 00:27:08,400
don't know whether I did something
to upset him.

426
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,670
You've gone too far.

427
00:27:12,670 --> 00:27:14,320
Listen.

428
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:17,780
Stop thinking that
you're always the messed up one.

429
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:19,780
Understand?

430
00:27:22,530 --> 00:27:26,660
I can't help thinking that
I might be too boing for him.

431
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:30,090
Ugh how can anyone
think that way, Eiw?

432
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:32,470
True! Even I think
but I haven't said it out loud.

433
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:34,690
- Huh Kung?
- Just kidding.

434
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:37,100
Why so stressed?
Just eat the dog's penis.

435
00:27:37,100 --> 00:27:38,080
Huh?

436
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:39,400
What do you mean Kung,
by dog's penis?

437
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:41,100
They call it sausages.

438
00:27:41,100 --> 00:27:42,650
The dog's penis kinda sausage.
(The shape and the color looks like dog's penis, so Thai people call it that.)

439
00:27:42,650 --> 00:27:45,440
Not very often that you'd tried new things,
eat up my friend.

440
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,880
You guys always force me to eat so...

441
00:27:47,880 --> 00:27:50,750
- Here Fee...
- No. I'm full.

442
00:27:50,750 --> 00:27:53,070
- I believe you can do it.
- Eat. You're not that full.

443
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:58,190
Ugh. I'm super full.

444
00:27:58,190 --> 00:27:59,810
Where are you goin' next, Eiw?

445
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,810
Library or under the building?

446
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:04,690
I'm gonna buy some snacks
and then I'll go to the under building.

447
00:28:04,690 --> 00:28:06,250
Ok I'm going with you.

448
00:28:06,250 --> 00:28:08,080
But let me go to the bathroom
real quick.

449
00:28:08,080 --> 00:28:08,990
Sure.

450
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:10,990
What about you Kung?

451
00:28:10,990 --> 00:28:13,490
- I'm going to see a senior at the computer room.
- I see.

452
00:28:13,490 --> 00:28:16,980
- See you in the class then.
- Ok. See you Kung.

453
00:28:16,980 --> 00:28:20,620
- See you.
- Come on Eiw! I have to poop.

454
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:27,140
Hey!
The bathroom is out of service.

455
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:30,080
Ugh. I don't wanna use
the other building's.

456
00:28:31,290 --> 00:28:34,490
Then we can go use the one
next to the canteen.

457
00:28:34,490 --> 00:28:36,490
Ew no.

458
00:28:36,490 --> 00:28:37,780
I don't wanna smell cigarette.

459
00:28:37,780 --> 00:28:40,560
People always sneakily smoke
behind there.

460
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,980
Or do you prefer to walk
to the other building?

461
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:48,040
Fine. I'll bear the smell.

462
00:28:48,040 --> 00:28:51,270
We walk around like this,
the break will probably almost over.

463
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:05,380
Sand.
How many have you smoked?

464
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:07,380
Just one, shit head.

465
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,920
Is that Sand's voice, your friend?

466
00:29:19,650 --> 00:29:22,200
I just bought some from uncle.

467
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,860
Got a free money for 5,000.

468
00:29:25,860 --> 00:29:27,860
Hey where did you get it?

469
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,900
I got it from the guy I met
at the bus stop.

470
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,740
The one you told me?

471
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:36,740
Yeah that one.

472
00:29:36,740 --> 00:29:39,500
Shit and you tricked him
to get the money?

473
00:29:40,890 --> 00:29:43,150
I didn't mean to trick him
for the money actually.

474
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:46,520
I just wanted him to pay a little.

475
00:29:46,520 --> 00:29:48,520
Eat free shit and stuff.

476
00:29:48,770 --> 00:29:51,440
He always tell stories about his mom.

477
00:29:51,440 --> 00:29:54,480
Always praise his own family
that they're perfect.

478
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:55,880
If he really has a lot of money,

479
00:29:55,880 --> 00:29:59,610
- then he should share some for me, right?
- Yeah.

480
00:29:59,610 --> 00:30:01,610
Let's go Eiw.

481
00:30:05,420 --> 00:30:07,140
Eiw.

482
00:30:09,140 --> 00:30:11,770
Eiw wait!

483
00:30:11,770 --> 00:30:13,530
What's wrong?

484
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,030
I'm fine.

485
00:30:15,030 --> 00:30:17,030
- Who made you cry?
- Nothing.

486
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,320
- Eiw!
- Hey stop!

487
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,320
What's happening?

488
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:26,550
What's the matter?
Tell me!

489
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:28,550
Who made Eiw cry?
Tell me.

490
00:30:30,550 --> 00:30:32,860
Why are you stuttering?
Tell me.

491
00:30:32,860 --> 00:30:34,860
It's Sand.

492
00:30:46,410 --> 00:30:48,760
Eiw I've been looking for you!

493
00:30:48,760 --> 00:30:51,110
Calm down.
I'm okay.

494
00:30:51,110 --> 00:30:52,620
No.

495
00:30:52,620 --> 00:30:56,460
I just wanna tell you that
Cake got called into principal's office.

496
00:30:56,460 --> 00:30:58,460
What why?
You told him?

497
00:30:58,460 --> 00:31:00,910
If I didn't tell him,

498
00:31:00,910 --> 00:31:03,390
it would be me and Cake
who'll be in the office.

499
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:05,170
Because he was gonna punch me
if I didn't tell him.

500
00:31:05,170 --> 00:31:06,630
How could I not tell him?

501
00:31:06,630 --> 00:31:08,630
Let's go.

502
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:14,740
- How's everything?
- They're still talking.

503
00:31:19,780 --> 00:31:21,660
Hey where're you going Eiw?

504
00:31:21,660 --> 00:31:23,330
I'm going to explain to them, Fee.

505
00:31:23,330 --> 00:31:25,330
No you can't.
They might get you involved.

506
00:31:25,630 --> 00:31:27,880
Why not?
Cake got in trouble because of me!

507
00:31:27,880 --> 00:31:30,780
I know, but if you go in now
it would cause more problem.

508
00:31:30,780 --> 00:31:32,000
Now it's just fighting issue,

509
00:31:32,000 --> 00:31:34,000
but if you jump in,
you might even have to go to the police.

510
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,440
At least, Cake will be punished less.

511
00:31:36,440 --> 00:31:38,440
Cake started first,
wasn't it Fee?

512
00:31:38,440 --> 00:31:40,640
If I have a reason,
then the teacher would understand us.

513
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:42,640
Let' just wait Eiw.

514
00:31:42,790 --> 00:31:45,750
Cake wouldn't got into a fight,
if he wanted you to be involved.

515
00:31:45,750 --> 00:31:49,190
But everything happened
because of me, wasn't it?

516
00:31:49,190 --> 00:31:50,250
I understand.

517
00:31:50,250 --> 00:31:53,410
But if you go in now,
it'll be more problematic.

518
00:31:53,410 --> 00:31:55,410
Eiw. Please listen to Fee.

519
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:57,520
Let's just wait and
see how things go.

520
00:31:57,520 --> 00:32:00,350
I heard that they're gonna call
each of their parents in.

521
00:32:00,350 --> 00:32:02,350
Call their parents?

522
00:32:02,950 --> 00:32:04,350
Calm down Eiw.

523
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:07,680
Just wait.

524
00:32:19,180 --> 00:32:21,220
Why are you guys gathering here?

525
00:32:21,980 --> 00:32:23,910
Go. Go back to your class.

526
00:32:23,910 --> 00:32:25,140
Come.

527
00:32:25,140 --> 00:32:27,140
Go to class.

528
00:32:29,710 --> 00:32:31,140
He'll be fine.

529
00:33:41,150 --> 00:33:42,300
Cake.

530
00:33:42,300 --> 00:33:44,190
We'll talk later.

531
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:45,720
My mom is waiting downstairs.

532
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:48,420
We were talking too long,
so she's waiting to take me home.

533
00:33:49,720 --> 00:33:52,010
- How are you my friend?
- Hey shit head.

534
00:33:52,010 --> 00:33:54,010
- You're bullying him.
- That hurts.

535
00:33:54,010 --> 00:33:56,150
- You deserved that.
- I will tell you guys later.

536
00:33:56,150 --> 00:33:58,710
- I'm waiting for you to spill the tea.
- Yeah.

537
00:33:59,550 --> 00:34:01,910
Just talk on MSN tonight.

538
00:34:02,390 --> 00:34:05,820
If my mom doesn't nag or
prevent me to be on the computer.

539
00:34:05,820 --> 00:34:08,100
Your ass is gonna be on fire
from the punishment.

540
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:10,920
Hey so I can't go to
your place today?

541
00:34:10,920 --> 00:34:12,920
This is not the time.

542
00:34:14,060 --> 00:34:16,560
Don't be so serious!

543
00:34:16,810 --> 00:34:20,070
- Good luck. Talk to you later.
- Ok.

544
00:34:20,889 --> 00:34:22,820
- Talk to you on MSN.
- See ya.

545
00:34:25,590 --> 00:34:27,130
Let's go.

546
00:34:36,929 --> 00:34:38,940
Hi aunty Proud.

547
00:34:41,210 --> 00:34:43,120
Get in the car.

548
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:46,710
Aunty Proud.

549
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:48,010
Eiw.

550
00:34:49,030 --> 00:34:51,620
Please don't punish Cake.

551
00:34:52,110 --> 00:34:53,620
It's...

552
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:56,010
Cake misbehaved.

553
00:34:56,010 --> 00:34:58,010
How can I not punish him?

554
00:34:59,490 --> 00:35:00,760
But...

555
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:02,760
Cake got into a fight
was because of me.

556
00:35:08,820 --> 00:35:10,970
What do you mean?

557
00:35:14,540 --> 00:35:16,920
Do you have anything else
you need to tell me?

558
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:21,180
Did you tell everything
in the principal's office?

559
00:35:31,890 --> 00:35:33,610
I don't have anything else to say.

560
00:35:36,670 --> 00:35:39,820
Why did you punch him then
if you have no reasons?

561
00:35:45,820 --> 00:35:47,830
Anything you wanna tell me,
See-Eiw?

562
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:54,530
Yes.

563
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,980
"Mama's Dim Sum"

564
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:18,050
Stop crying.

565
00:36:18,050 --> 00:36:20,050
You've been crying all day, haven't you?

566
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:28,110
Everyone scolded me
when I told the whole story.

567
00:36:30,110 --> 00:36:33,090
You kinda deserved that, wasn't it?

568
00:36:33,090 --> 00:36:36,750
You lent your friend 5,000 Baht
at this age.

569
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:42,880
Think about how long you need to save
to have that amount of money.

570
00:36:42,880 --> 00:36:44,880
Why did you give it to others easily?

571
00:36:46,880 --> 00:36:50,490
Sand was in trouble at that time.

572
00:36:50,490 --> 00:36:52,180
He looked like he was in trouble.

573
00:36:52,180 --> 00:36:54,180
He was my friend bro.

574
00:36:54,540 --> 00:36:56,180
How could I not help?

575
00:36:58,180 --> 00:37:01,100
I understand.

576
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:03,850
But you can't trust anyone that easy.

577
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:07,140
And you told me yourself...

578
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:09,140
that you just met him
not so long ago.

579
00:37:09,370 --> 00:37:11,140
Sand was a good guy.

580
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,710
He was so kind to me.

581
00:37:31,510 --> 00:37:33,710
Listen to me.

582
00:37:36,030 --> 00:37:39,470
When you see someone's bad side,

583
00:37:39,470 --> 00:37:41,320
don't judge them right away...

584
00:37:41,320 --> 00:37:43,320
that he/she is exactly a bad person.

585
00:37:44,240 --> 00:37:46,940
Or even you see
a good side of someone,

586
00:37:46,940 --> 00:37:49,130
that doesn't mean that
he/she is a good person.

587
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,890
Um.

588
00:37:51,890 --> 00:37:53,520
Nobody is all bad,

589
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:55,980
and nobody is good
and perfect all the time.

590
00:37:56,900 --> 00:37:59,780
That means...

591
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:01,780
when someone acts nice to you,

592
00:38:03,700 --> 00:38:06,520
that doesn't mean that
he would never do bad things to you.

593
00:38:10,950 --> 00:38:13,600
You're not wrong for being positive.

594
00:38:13,600 --> 00:38:15,600
You're also not wrong for being kind.

595
00:38:17,310 --> 00:38:18,710
But...

596
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,880
you need to learn
to be careful, understand?

597
00:38:22,710 --> 00:38:25,010
I don't know how though.

598
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,920
Trusting someone easily is not good.

599
00:38:33,920 --> 00:38:36,350
Don't trust people easily is also not good.

600
00:38:37,210 --> 00:38:39,920
You just need to find the balance.

601
00:38:42,580 --> 00:38:46,380
I know that just saying it is easy,
to actually do it is difficult.

602
00:38:46,870 --> 00:38:48,780
If it's easy,
there'd be no one got tricked.

603
00:38:48,780 --> 00:38:50,780
Right?

604
00:38:51,640 --> 00:38:53,110
But I don't want...

605
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:55,110
you to overthinking about this...

606
00:38:56,550 --> 00:38:58,570
until you don't trust anyone anymore.

607
00:38:58,570 --> 00:39:00,570
Understand?

608
00:39:00,570 --> 00:39:02,570
I do.

609
00:39:04,040 --> 00:39:06,310
Take this as a lesson.

610
00:39:07,090 --> 00:39:08,990
To think about it,

611
00:39:08,990 --> 00:39:10,990
and be more careful in the future.

612
00:39:12,530 --> 00:39:14,970
Before trusting anyone,

613
00:39:15,980 --> 00:39:18,290
get to know them first.

614
00:39:18,830 --> 00:39:20,290
But don't...

615
00:39:20,290 --> 00:39:22,290
build a wall and shut them out completely.

616
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,220
It's like...

617
00:39:25,220 --> 00:39:26,820
you just peak through the door...

618
00:39:26,820 --> 00:39:28,820
bit by bit.

619
00:39:29,590 --> 00:39:31,430
Let them in a little.

620
00:39:35,270 --> 00:39:37,440
Sometimes my door...

621
00:39:37,680 --> 00:39:41,230
might be too narrow to let anyone in.

622
00:39:43,230 --> 00:39:46,040
If that person really wants to get in,

623
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:48,570
he/she will try
to make themselves small...

624
00:39:50,360 --> 00:39:52,570
and fit into that narrow door instead.

625
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,770
Would that kind of person
really exist?

626
00:39:56,990 --> 00:39:58,830
Definitely.

627
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:01,190
You've got at least one.

628
00:40:07,740 --> 00:40:10,240
Do not stress, ok?

629
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,050
Feeling better?

630
00:40:17,050 --> 00:40:19,050
Brother.

631
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:21,950
How about I take you for some snacks?

632
00:40:21,950 --> 00:40:23,950
Do you wanna have Sago?

633
00:40:23,950 --> 00:40:25,950
On me.

634
00:40:27,140 --> 00:40:27,950
Good!

635
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:29,950
Go wash your face.

636
00:40:30,270 --> 00:40:34,080
Why're you still crying?
Stop it.

637
00:40:35,930 --> 00:40:38,740
Go go wash up.

638
00:40:38,740 --> 00:40:40,740
I will wait downstairs, ok?

639
00:40:42,770 --> 00:40:44,130
Thank you.

640
00:40:44,130 --> 00:40:45,430
Hm?

641
00:40:45,980 --> 00:40:47,430
See you downstairs.

642
00:40:55,290 --> 00:40:56,290
Cake.

643
00:40:56,290 --> 00:40:58,290
Turn around.

644
00:40:58,290 --> 00:41:01,140
Mom. Are you still punishing me?
My whole body is so sore already.

645
00:41:01,140 --> 00:41:03,140
Why are you laughing?

646
00:41:05,550 --> 00:41:07,400
Why did you hit me?

647
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:09,030
So you will learn.

648
00:41:09,030 --> 00:41:11,030
And remember that
you shouldn't be hot-headed

649
00:41:11,030 --> 00:41:12,590
and get in a fight again.

650
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:15,060
You know why I did that.
Ow.

651
00:41:16,400 --> 00:41:19,820
- Keep going mom.
- You shush.

652
00:41:19,820 --> 00:41:22,770
- Mom he's gonna hit me.
- How dare?

653
00:41:22,770 --> 00:41:24,990
- How dare you hit your sister?
- Yeah. How dare.

654
00:41:27,390 --> 00:41:29,400
Dad.
Help me.

655
00:41:29,400 --> 00:41:31,400
Hey, don't get me involved.

656
00:41:32,670 --> 00:41:35,550
- Don't step in.
- See!

657
00:41:35,550 --> 00:41:37,930
Well...how's your enemy?

658
00:41:37,930 --> 00:41:39,930
That guy?

659
00:41:40,550 --> 00:41:42,930
He is hurt like
twice of me for sure, dad.

660
00:41:44,930 --> 00:41:47,710
Twice?

661
00:41:48,860 --> 00:41:51,160
- Ow.
- Are you gonna remember?

662
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,540
- Fine. I won't do it anymore.
- Get over here.

663
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:55,540
Come here.

664
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:05,940
Do you like hanging out with him?

665
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:07,940
I like it.

666
00:42:08,150 --> 00:42:09,940
You like it more than when you’re with me?

667
00:42:10,900 --> 00:42:12,570
Am I still important to you?

668
00:42:12,570 --> 00:42:14,570
So if something happened, I I don’t have to tell you, right?

669
00:42:16,260 --> 00:42:18,520
I’m sorry I didn’t tell you earlier

670
00:42:18,520 --> 00:42:20,520
But I really do feel that way.

671
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:23,570
Until I can’t leave it like this anymore.

672
00:42:23,570 --> 00:42:25,490
You had all those time,

673
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,490
why didn’t you tell me?

674
00:42:30,520 --> 00:42:33,510
My dad has to go work in America.

675
00:42:33,510 --> 00:42:35,510
Are you going to America?
