1
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:03,220
Class dismissed.

2
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:06,040
Thank you.

3
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:10,140
Kung. Wake up.
It's lunch break.

4
00:00:29,280 --> 00:00:31,280
Where shall
we have lunch today?

5
00:00:34,700 --> 00:00:36,540
The teacher let us go early
... canteen?

6
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,840
Probably not a lot of people yet.

7
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,240
I actually wanna have Suki.
What do you think Eiw?

8
00:00:40,580 --> 00:00:42,520
Um. We can go to the canteen.

9
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:43,770
Um Ok.
Let's go.

10
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:45,770
Come on Eiw!
Before there'll be lots of people.

11
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:47,770
Go.

12
00:01:08,420 --> 00:01:10,820
Err...I changed my mind.

13
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,100
I better go buy
some bread from the school mart.

14
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:15,780
Why?

15
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,780
We've arrived here.

16
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,780
I'm not that hungry.

17
00:01:19,780 --> 00:01:21,780
You guys go ahead and eat.

18
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,980
I gotta go.

19
00:01:27,050 --> 00:01:28,490
Hey Eiw!

20
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:34,860
He only eats bread
from the mart.

21
00:01:36,860 --> 00:01:38,120
Let's go.

22
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,120
Let's have some Suki.

23
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,690
- Eiw?
- Hm?

24
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:09,780
How are you?
Are you alright...?

25
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,780
- From the sickness?
- Um.

26
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:15,600
I'm better,
but still taking some medicines.

27
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:17,600
Where's Fee?

28
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:19,600
He went to the his club room.

29
00:02:32,240 --> 00:02:34,250
Why do you look
so tired today Kung?

30
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,540
I saw you napping
this morning too.

31
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,540
What did you do?

32
00:02:39,740 --> 00:02:41,290
I stayed up late
watching a movie.

33
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:45,180
What movie?

34
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:47,520
The movie from Theme Movie channel.

35
00:02:47,520 --> 00:02:49,520
They put on some good shows.

36
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,520
I might stay up late again tonight.

37
00:02:58,850 --> 00:02:59,970
Hey.

38
00:03:00,490 --> 00:03:01,580
Hm?

39
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,130
What are you guys
fighting about?

40
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,360
Who do you mean?

41
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:11,330
With Cake.

42
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:15,020
No.
We're not fighting.

43
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,380
- Really?
- Um.

44
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,290
And why did you walk away then?

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:24,600
No. I just wanna have some bread.
That's all.

46
00:03:27,020 --> 00:03:28,660
Wait.

47
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,160
I haven't told you
when exactly did you walk away.

48
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,160
Are you having
a guilty conscience?

49
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:34,160
Hmm?

50
00:03:44,900 --> 00:03:47,980
Would you be able to do the fitness test,
eating only this?

51
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:50,370
Ugh!

52
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,010
I don't wanna do the test, Kung.

53
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:57,320
No. Just eat up.
You need to eat a lot. Come on.

54
00:03:57,320 --> 00:03:58,730
You won't have the strength.

55
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:00,490
Thinking about it is already
making me feel weak.

56
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:01,840
Eat up.

57
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:03,840
After finishing this one,
go buy another one.

58
00:04:04,420 --> 00:04:06,010
Eat.

59
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,980
Ready. Set.

60
00:05:20,760 --> 00:05:21,980
Go!

61
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,610
Next.
See-Eiw. Toffee.

62
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,610
And Peak.

63
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:36,830
Ready, Eiw?

64
00:05:38,540 --> 00:05:40,540
Ready.

65
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:42,540
Set.

66
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,540
Go!

67
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:48,600
Hey!

68
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,080
Hey.
Don't gather around.
Get someone from the infirmary now.

69
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:55,730
You got any inhalers?

70
00:05:56,060 --> 00:05:57,570
I didn't bring any.

71
00:05:57,570 --> 00:05:59,570
- I don't have it.
- Is the teacher here?

72
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:04,020
Don't gather around him.
Please get someone from the infirmary.

73
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,020
Are you ok, Eiw?

74
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:20,250
Are you awake?

75
00:06:21,320 --> 00:06:22,850
How are you?

76
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:24,850
Did you know that you fainted?

77
00:06:28,010 --> 00:06:29,600
Headache.

78
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:31,600
Of course you are.

79
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,280
Kung told me
you didn't have a proper lunch.

80
00:06:37,770 --> 00:06:39,480
But I did eat.

81
00:06:39,480 --> 00:06:41,050
The bread.

82
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:42,900
Was it enough?

83
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:44,900
If it was enough,
you wouldn't be here.

84
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:49,730
Are you guys done with the test?

85
00:06:49,730 --> 00:06:51,020
Um.

86
00:06:51,020 --> 00:06:52,520
All done.

87
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:54,520
I'm about to go home.

88
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:55,930
Hey.

89
00:06:56,440 --> 00:06:58,200
Why don't you
go back to the class?

90
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,890
I'm worried about you.

91
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,900
Then I'll go back
to the class then.

92
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:10,250
No. No.
Lay down.

93
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,360
- Lay down.
- I'm feeling better.

94
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,020
No. Class is almost over.

95
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:18,700
I'm fine.
I'm better.

96
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:21,640
Better?

97
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,980
You look pale like
some boiled chicken.

98
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:29,370
What time is it now?

99
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,770
2-ish.

100
00:07:32,090 --> 00:07:33,770
What?

101
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,210
And how come you're here?

102
00:07:37,370 --> 00:07:39,210
The teacher didn't
tell you to go to class?

103
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:41,210
I did go to the class,

104
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,560
but I just asked
to go to the bathroom.

105
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:44,240
So I decided to stop by.

106
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:46,240
I'm here for a bit
and you're awake.

107
00:07:47,920 --> 00:07:50,970
You wait here.
I have to go back to the class now.

108
00:07:51,600 --> 00:07:53,409
I'll come pick you up
when the class is over.

109
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,409
We can just meet
at the bus stop.

110
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:57,930
No. I'll come get you, ok?

111
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,900
Go to the class.

112
00:08:06,760 --> 00:08:08,420
Are you scared being here alone?

113
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,420
I'm fine.
You can go.

114
00:08:11,340 --> 00:08:12,690
I can stay here by myself.

115
00:08:17,890 --> 00:08:19,960
- I'll be back.
- Um. I know.

116
00:08:20,760 --> 00:08:22,450
You should go
to the class already.

117
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:24,450
Why are you crying?

118
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:10,360
Your mom is home.

119
00:09:11,930 --> 00:09:14,380
Um. She's here.
I'll go to my place first.

120
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,380
I'll just go get my stuff
at yours later.

121
00:09:16,970 --> 00:09:19,880
That's fine. I'll bring your stuff over.
I'll spend a night with you today.

122
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:21,730
Why?

123
00:09:21,730 --> 00:09:23,730
I've got something
to talk to you.

124
00:09:24,140 --> 00:09:25,730
See you after dinner.

125
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,730
Wait Cake!

126
00:09:28,210 --> 00:09:30,300
I think I'm gonna watch
something from Theme Movie.

127
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:32,890
I don't think
I can talk tonight.

128
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,900
You watch this channel too?

129
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,620
There's only movie.
No cartoon.

130
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:39,540
Um. I will watch it.

131
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:41,540
You don't have to come over.

132
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,560
I...

133
00:09:45,560 --> 00:09:47,160
will watch with you.

134
00:09:47,160 --> 00:09:49,160
I like that channel anyway.

135
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,620
See you then.

136
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,040
Mom!

137
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:00,840
Oh. You're home.

138
00:10:00,840 --> 00:10:02,840
I miss you.

139
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:05,460
How's grandma?

140
00:10:05,460 --> 00:10:08,400
She's better now.
She's been taking medicine and has to rest a lot.

141
00:10:08,900 --> 00:10:11,100
Go change and come down for dinner.

142
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:13,820
I stopped by at Siang's Duck on the way back.

143
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,480
For real!?
I better share some with Cake!

144
00:10:18,770 --> 00:10:20,040
Actually. No.

145
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:23,290
Hey why not?
I bought a whole lot.

146
00:10:23,290 --> 00:10:25,810
No.
I'm gonna go change now.

147
00:10:27,940 --> 00:10:29,600
Are you guys fighting again?

148
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,010
Pround's Bakery

149
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:40,930
It's a Thai movie today.

150
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:44,320
Horror type too.

151
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,930
Let's just not watch it?

152
00:10:54,730 --> 00:10:56,760
No, I wanna watch it.

153
00:10:57,820 --> 00:10:59,530
You might not
be able to sleep.

154
00:10:59,840 --> 00:11:01,080
Cake!

155
00:11:01,080 --> 00:11:03,840
If you're sleepy then go ahead,
take a shower and go to bed.

156
00:11:05,730 --> 00:11:07,000
Telling me to go away huh.

157
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:32,490
- Boo!!
- Ugh!

158
00:11:32,490 --> 00:11:33,490
Cake!

159
00:11:36,990 --> 00:11:39,230
Just stop watching it.
Go to bed.

160
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:41,230
No.

161
00:11:41,510 --> 00:11:43,230
I want to finish this.

162
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,130
How?

163
00:11:45,130 --> 00:11:47,650
You cover your
whole face like that, huh?

164
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,560
Leave me alone.

165
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:53,590
Do you wanna sit with me?

166
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:34,280
I don't understand why you watch it,
if you're so scared.

167
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:40,310
What's wrong?
What did I do that make you mad hm?

168
00:12:40,310 --> 00:12:41,740
I'm not.

169
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:44,520
If you're not mad,
then what's the matter?

170
00:12:47,230 --> 00:12:48,530
What's wrong?

171
00:12:49,510 --> 00:12:50,530
I don't know.

172
00:12:53,140 --> 00:12:54,830
Stop avoiding me first.

173
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:00,400
If I know what's wrong
then you can be mad ok?

174
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:03,520
We never actually fight.

175
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:05,770
There's nothing
we have to fight, right?

176
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:07,820
It's true, isn't it?

177
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,790
You're ok then?

178
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,790
Should we stop watching it?

179
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:25,900
Should we?

180
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:36,850
Talk to me in the first place,
then we wouldn't have to watch this for so long.

181
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:42,150
Go take a shower.

182
00:13:48,080 --> 00:13:50,020
- Cake.
- Um?

183
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:52,020
Take me to
the bathroom, will you?

184
00:13:56,660 --> 00:13:59,310
- What?
- Should I take you or not?

185
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:02,660
- Go with me please.
- Should I go?

186
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:05,310
It's dark.

187
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,120
The bathroom
is super creepy too.

188
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,560
Cake!

189
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:13,270
Ok. I'll go with you.

190
00:14:13,270 --> 00:14:15,760
Go get your towel.
I'll wait in front of the bathroom.

191
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:18,460
You come with me.

192
00:14:25,750 --> 00:14:27,780
- Hey!
- Ugh!

193
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:43,640
- Cake!
- Um?

194
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,640
I will leave the door open a little bit.

195
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,640
Don't go anywhere.

196
00:14:47,640 --> 00:14:49,640
Yeah. I won't go anywhere.

197
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:52,120
- Do not prank me either.
- Ok. I won't.

198
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:54,120
Go take a shower.

199
00:14:57,590 --> 00:14:59,830
- Wait here.
- Um.

200
00:15:01,780 --> 00:15:03,100
- Boo!
- Hey!

201
00:15:03,100 --> 00:15:05,100
See. I haven't gone in
and you already prank me.

202
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:07,100
Just go shower.

203
00:15:16,270 --> 00:15:18,360
- Cake
- Hmm?

204
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,240
Cake?

205
00:15:23,240 --> 00:15:25,240
I'm here.

206
00:15:44,520 --> 00:15:46,220
- You're done?
- Um.

207
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:49,280
- You can shower next.
- Ok.

208
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:51,840
You want me to wait for you?

209
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,840
That's okay.
You can wait for me up there.

210
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:55,840
Ok.

211
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:04,940
Cake.

212
00:16:08,270 --> 00:16:09,380
Eiw?

213
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,350
Shit. That was not him.

214
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,240
Cake.

215
00:16:16,620 --> 00:16:18,990
Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake.

216
00:16:19,310 --> 00:16:21,750
- Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake.
- Eiw!

217
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,310
This is for me?/  This is for me?

218
00:16:30,310 --> 00:16:32,310
Yes.
I think it's time for you guys.

219
00:16:32,310 --> 00:16:35,500
Me and Proud bought you two cellphones.

220
00:16:36,190 --> 00:16:38,510
Just in case of anything,
you can call each other.

221
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,710
Hey. Hey.

222
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:45,630
Don't use it during class.

223
00:16:45,630 --> 00:16:46,540
Sure!

224
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:48,540
Manage the time to use wisely.

225
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:51,320
For the phone bill,

226
00:16:51,320 --> 00:16:53,320
you need to top-up yourself,
so you won't over spend.

227
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,800
Sure.

228
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
Thank you mom.

229
00:16:57,550 --> 00:16:58,960
Thank you mom.

230
00:17:43,000 --> 00:17:44,070
Cake.

231
00:17:45,040 --> 00:17:45,700
Hmm?

232
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,870
Are you that happy?

233
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:50,500
I am.
This is my first phone.

234
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:53,800
You're not happy?

235
00:17:53,800 --> 00:17:55,470
Umm...

236
00:17:55,470 --> 00:17:57,350
I am.

237
00:17:57,350 --> 00:17:59,350
But I don't know
who I'll use to call.

238
00:18:00,470 --> 00:18:02,380
To call your friends.

239
00:18:02,380 --> 00:18:04,380
You can send messages too.

240
00:18:05,940 --> 00:18:09,190
I don't have any friends
I would like to call or text to.

241
00:18:19,140 --> 00:18:21,070
Are you gonna play games?

242
00:18:21,070 --> 00:18:23,480
No.
I'm on MSN, talking with Rin.

243
00:18:26,310 --> 00:18:27,660
I told her to be
on MSN at 6.

244
00:18:33,950 --> 00:18:35,780
I wanna play checkers.

245
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,750
Now?

246
00:18:39,750 --> 00:18:41,750
Um. I wanna play.

247
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,790
I already told Rin to be on MSN.

248
00:18:48,790 --> 00:18:50,790
If I'm not online,
she might wonder where am I.

249
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:56,560
That's fine then.

250
00:19:00,840 --> 00:19:03,150
I will go play with you
in an hour or two.

251
00:19:03,510 --> 00:19:05,480
- Is that ok?
- Um ok.

252
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,900
He's so addicted to his phone.
He doesn't even eat.

253
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,030
Wow.
Don't blame it on him, Peak.

254
00:20:39,030 --> 00:20:41,340
I don't think it's the phone.

255
00:20:41,620 --> 00:20:43,340
If not the phone...

256
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:45,340
then what is it?

257
00:20:45,910 --> 00:20:47,340
I guess...

258
00:20:47,340 --> 00:20:49,700
it's probably
the person he's texting to.

259
00:20:53,230 --> 00:20:54,750
You guys are so good.

260
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:57,230
Good at knowing
what you're up to?

261
00:20:57,780 --> 00:20:59,550
Good at being nosy.

262
00:21:00,620 --> 00:21:02,540
Really good at being nosy,
my friends.

263
00:21:03,470 --> 00:21:05,600
What about you Ta?

264
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,600
You wanna sleep over
at my place tonight?

265
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,940
Sure.
We have to be here super early.
I could be late.

266
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:14,430
So what?
Are you going home with me after school?

267
00:21:14,430 --> 00:21:16,820
I will go later.
My family will drop me off in the evening.

268
00:21:17,540 --> 00:21:18,350
Ok.

269
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,680
Shit.

270
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:26,120
What?

271
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:28,120
Dude. I'm going to see Rin.

272
00:21:28,990 --> 00:21:30,120
What about your lunch?

273
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:32,310
I'm not gonna eat anymore.

274
00:21:32,310 --> 00:21:34,310
Put the plate away for me.
See you at the football field.

275
00:21:34,310 --> 00:21:36,310
See ya.

276
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,590
- It's so nice my friend being in love. - Why?

277
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,990
Why?

278
00:21:40,990 --> 00:21:44,300
Extra egg for me.
Pay the same amount.

279
00:21:44,300 --> 00:21:46,300
I will punch you.
I want that.

280
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,750
- No.
- Let me have it.

281
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:50,750
- I wanna have the egg, please let me have it.
- No.

282
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:52,750
You've got boiled egg.
I wanna have the sunny side up.

283
00:21:52,980 --> 00:21:55,120
The yolk is dripping!

284
00:21:55,390 --> 00:21:57,710
I have very little food on my plate.
You've got the boiled egg.

285
00:22:03,140 --> 00:22:05,620
Didn't you just
top-up the other day?

286
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,460
I used it all.

287
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,720
Why so quick?

288
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,040
Umm..I call and text a lot.

289
00:22:15,750 --> 00:22:18,400
But I already signed up
for free call after 10pm plan.

290
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,040
What time is
Ta going to be here?

291
00:22:23,040 --> 00:22:25,340
Umm...He said...

292
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:27,820
He's going back home first.

293
00:22:27,820 --> 00:22:29,820
He will be here shortly.

294
00:22:31,820 --> 00:22:33,710
My text box is full again.

295
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:35,710
Delete it.

296
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,340
No.

297
00:22:39,340 --> 00:22:41,120
I don't wanna lose it.

298
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,120
Rin texted me with lots of
cute messages.

299
00:22:48,680 --> 00:22:50,680
Which one should I delete?

300
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:54,270
You have to pack your bag today.

301
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:56,270
We're going to
the camp tomorrow.

302
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,710
Sure.

303
00:23:02,140 --> 00:23:04,430
You've been procrastinated
for so many days, Cake.

304
00:23:04,670 --> 00:23:07,360
Aunty Proud asked me
to force you do it.

305
00:23:08,550 --> 00:23:09,360
Um.

306
00:23:12,420 --> 00:23:13,340
Cake.

307
00:23:17,220 --> 00:23:18,150
Cake.

308
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:20,830
Huh?

309
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,080
Why are you so loud?

310
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:25,310
Because you're
constantly on your phone.

311
00:23:25,590 --> 00:23:28,580
I asked you questions
and you mumbled as an answer.

312
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:31,060
If you do not care,
I will go home now.

313
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,060
Ok. Ok.

314
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,060
I'm not on my phone now.

315
00:23:36,840 --> 00:23:38,560
Where?
Let's pack our bags.

316
00:23:48,860 --> 00:23:50,580
Are you mad?

317
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:52,580
I'm not.

318
00:23:54,230 --> 00:23:56,950
I will go take a shower.

319
00:23:58,260 --> 00:24:00,590
Wait.

320
00:24:00,590 --> 00:24:02,200
You're mad.

321
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,200
I'm not.

322
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:06,510
Yes you are.
See you are.

323
00:24:06,510 --> 00:24:08,510
Stop playing with my hair.

324
00:24:10,990 --> 00:24:12,760
I'm just gonna go shower.

325
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:14,380
Stop being mad at me first?

326
00:24:14,380 --> 00:24:16,380
I told you
I'm not mad.

327
00:24:16,560 --> 00:24:18,380
I'm goin' to shower
for a min.

328
00:24:19,820 --> 00:24:21,060
Ok.

329
00:24:21,950 --> 00:24:23,990
Come back
when you're done.

330
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:25,990
Hurry back.

331
00:24:33,070 --> 00:24:34,420
I'm goin' to shower then.

332
00:25:02,910 --> 00:25:04,940
Do I have everything?

333
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:09,580
4 shirts and pants
(4 outfits, towel, soap, shampoo, toothbrush)

334
00:25:10,920 --> 00:25:12,190
Seems like missing something.

335
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,550
I'm letting you win
I'm closing one eye.

336
00:25:15,920 --> 00:25:18,380
Look at your HP.

337
00:25:18,380 --> 00:25:22,110
Oh the flashlight.

338
00:25:22,380 --> 00:25:24,310
Cake. Cake.

339
00:25:25,420 --> 00:25:26,680
Cake.

340
00:25:26,680 --> 00:25:28,670
- I like to move it, move it. How's that?
- Cake.

341
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:29,400
Hmm?

342
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,200
You've got any flashlights?

343
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,200
Flashlight?
It should be in that cabinet.

344
00:25:33,550 --> 00:25:35,200
This shithead.

345
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:37,200
You took advantage huh?

346
00:25:37,840 --> 00:25:39,200
This cabinet?

347
00:25:40,910 --> 00:25:42,580
Pay attention to Eiw.

348
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:44,580
Go help him find it.

349
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:46,580
Where is it? Top or bottom shelf?

350
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,060
- Go play SuperMario.
- It's not here Cake.

351
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:48,940
- Pay attention to him!
- Huh?

352
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,180
There's nothing.

353
00:25:50,180 --> 00:25:51,990
Is there something pile on top of it?

354
00:25:51,990 --> 00:25:53,780
Hey Cake I can't see!

355
00:25:53,780 --> 00:25:55,460
Cake I cannot find it.

356
00:25:55,460 --> 00:25:57,460
I will go find it myself.

357
00:25:57,980 --> 00:26:01,910
Then you go find it ok?
I will fold all the clothes.

358
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:03,910
Yes sir.

359
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:08,780
Hey don't cheat.

360
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:11,160
I can't press the button.
Is your joystick broken?

361
00:26:11,420 --> 00:26:15,900
- You're not good at all. You cheated
- My Friend. My little friend.

362
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,900
You never teach me
and cheated on me.

363
00:26:17,900 --> 00:26:19,900
I closed both of my eyes for you already.

364
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:21,540
How did I cheat?

365
00:26:21,540 --> 00:26:22,910
You did cheat.

366
00:26:22,910 --> 00:26:24,910
Stupid!

367
00:26:26,750 --> 00:26:28,750
Ok. I'll give you one more game.

368
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:30,750
Cheater.

369
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,400
If you won another round,
I'll let you slap me.

370
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:34,700
- For real?
- Yeah.

371
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:37,280
- Cake I prepared everything for you already.
- But if you lost, you're done.

372
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,980
- You are. Not me!
- And I only get to slap?

373
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:40,980
Cake.

374
00:26:41,750 --> 00:26:43,950
- Huh?
- Don't forget to check your stuff.

375
00:26:43,950 --> 00:26:45,950
Ok sure thing.

376
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:51,640
- Mosquito!
- Cake.

377
00:26:51,640 --> 00:26:53,640
Mosquito?
I'll kill it for you.

378
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,640
Cake. It's all packed.

379
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,640
- Hmm??
- It's all packed. Only the flashlight left.

380
00:26:58,700 --> 00:27:00,150
Ok.
I will look for it myself.

381
00:27:03,390 --> 00:27:05,080
I will go to bed then.

382
00:27:06,340 --> 00:27:07,340
Hmm?

383
00:27:07,340 --> 00:27:09,340
- I said I'm goin' to bed.
- Sure.

384
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:11,870
You can turn off the main light.

385
00:27:12,630 --> 00:27:14,080
I will play quietly.

386
00:27:25,300 --> 00:27:28,820
- You cheated. Cheated on me.
- You are.

387
00:27:41,240 --> 00:27:43,520
- Can I have
- Sure.

388
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:47,660
You guys should go to bed too.

389
00:27:48,060 --> 00:27:49,660
Sweet dream.

390
00:28:03,030 --> 00:28:05,600
Should we stop
and go to bed?

391
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:07,600
Ok.

392
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:09,120
I'm also sleepy.

393
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:11,360
If we don't go to bed,
Eiw will scream at me in the morning.

394
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:31,380
You guys are super close.

395
00:28:31,920 --> 00:28:33,760
Um. We are.

396
00:28:34,140 --> 00:28:35,760
We've been together
since we were born.

397
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,100
He takes care of you so well.

398
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:41,140
Yeah. That's Eiw.

399
00:28:42,740 --> 00:28:43,950
That's awesome...

400
00:28:44,440 --> 00:28:46,360
having a friend
as your neighbor next door.

401
00:28:46,560 --> 00:28:48,360
I'm so damn lonely.

402
00:28:49,720 --> 00:28:52,620
All my neighbors are not our age.

403
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:56,200
I think me and Eiw
is not only next door neighbor.

404
00:28:58,420 --> 00:29:00,150
He's both my friend...

405
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,560
...and my brother.

406
00:29:04,910 --> 00:29:06,860
It's like he is
another half of me actually.

407
00:29:07,150 --> 00:29:09,390
Um. I believe you.

408
00:29:09,960 --> 00:29:11,500
Um Let's go to sleep.

409
00:29:12,040 --> 00:29:13,500
- I'll turn off the light for you.
- Hey. Hey.

410
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:16,940
Can we leave it on?

411
00:29:20,120 --> 00:29:21,460
I'm scared of the ghost.

412
00:29:24,540 --> 00:29:26,720
Why do you have to beg me?
I can leave it on for you.

413
00:29:32,180 --> 00:29:33,550
See you in the morning.

414
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:34,550
Um.

415
00:31:17,040 --> 00:31:19,460
Err..Cake hasn't come down?

416
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:22,060
Um. He hasn't finished showering.

417
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:24,060
I finished first,
that's why I came down first.

418
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:32,670
This is good.

419
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:47,760
You're full, Eiw?

420
00:31:48,160 --> 00:31:49,760
Oh yes.

421
00:31:49,920 --> 00:31:52,700
I am.
I already ate a few.

422
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:09,580
What about...

423
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,580
Eiw's bag?

424
00:32:12,260 --> 00:32:13,840
Here.

425
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,780
The bag...

426
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,920
Hey what group are you in?

427
00:32:29,920 --> 00:32:31,920
Is it the same group with Cake?

428
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:34,220
Um.

429
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:36,220
Yes.

430
00:32:36,220 --> 00:32:38,220
I'm in the same group with Cake.

431
00:32:52,310 --> 00:32:53,790
Let's go.
I'm done.

432
00:32:58,790 --> 00:33:01,300
Eating like that you might
freaking choke to death.

433
00:33:03,000 --> 00:33:04,280
Want some water?

434
00:33:04,630 --> 00:33:05,630
Cake!

435
00:33:08,630 --> 00:33:10,070
I'm choking.

436
00:33:12,300 --> 00:33:13,300
Let's go.

437
00:33:30,270 --> 00:33:32,260
What are you playing?
Can I play too?

438
00:33:32,260 --> 00:33:33,440
Hey guys.

439
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:34,440
Hey.

440
00:33:35,620 --> 00:33:36,860
So damn sleepy.

441
00:33:36,860 --> 00:33:38,460
Don't know why do we have
to be here super early.

442
00:33:38,460 --> 00:33:40,460
Yeah. I didn't...

443
00:33:40,460 --> 00:33:42,460
wanna wake
the hell up this morning.

444
00:33:42,580 --> 00:33:44,460
But you're the latest one here.

445
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:46,460
This idiot woke up late
for sure.

446
00:33:46,460 --> 00:33:48,760
I had no sleep.
You asked me to play game all night.

447
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,480
Actually...

448
00:33:51,480 --> 00:33:53,700
You lost so many times
and kept asking to play again.

449
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:57,240
He sucks at playing games.

450
00:33:59,980 --> 00:34:01,460
Dude.

451
00:34:01,460 --> 00:34:02,840
Did you bring any toothpaste?

452
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:04,840
No.
I'm actually gonna borrow someone.

453
00:34:05,830 --> 00:34:07,280
You family is quite well-off.

454
00:34:07,280 --> 00:34:09,280
Buy it sometimes.

455
00:34:09,920 --> 00:34:13,350
Shit. I only have the toothbrush,
but not the toothpaste.

456
00:34:13,710 --> 00:34:15,350
What about you Ta?
You have it?

457
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,719
- Me?
- Yeah.

458
00:34:16,719 --> 00:34:18,719
I don't even have a toothbrush.

459
00:34:18,719 --> 00:34:20,719
Wow.

460
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,310
- Cake.
- Did you brush your teeth,
spending a night at my place?

461
00:34:25,659 --> 00:34:27,310
Cake I was just kidding.

462
00:34:27,310 --> 00:34:29,830
- Don't talk to us.
- I was kidding.

463
00:34:30,260 --> 00:34:33,620
Cake has it.
I saw See-Eiw packed and put it in his bag.

464
00:34:33,620 --> 00:34:35,620
- Couldn't ask for more.
- Fuck you.

465
00:34:35,620 --> 00:34:37,310
Why didn't you pack it yourself?

466
00:34:37,310 --> 00:34:40,750
You guys are talking a lot,
you don't get to use my toothpaste.

467
00:34:40,750 --> 00:34:43,360
I will look for you first thing
in the morning Sweetie.

468
00:34:44,440 --> 00:34:46,510
Yeah. You go sleep next to him.

469
00:34:46,510 --> 00:34:48,510
Sleep next to my feet first.

470
00:34:48,510 --> 00:34:50,510
- Call me sweetie? Come check out my feet.
- Sweetie.

471
00:34:50,510 --> 00:34:52,510
Come on.

472
00:34:52,510 --> 00:34:54,510
Shit. Hey. Why am I involving?

473
00:34:54,510 --> 00:34:56,510
Or should I stand on the table?

474
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:02,810
Where's Fee?

475
00:35:03,600 --> 00:35:04,810
I'm here!

476
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:07,790
What happened?
Woke up late?

477
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,790
Yeah. My mom woke me
but I fell back asleep.

478
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:12,420
I thought
I was not gonna make it.

479
00:35:12,420 --> 00:35:13,980
The traffic is so bad.

480
00:35:13,980 --> 00:35:16,760
It's okay. If you're late you can
have someone drives you like last year.

481
00:35:16,760 --> 00:35:19,620
My dad would kill me.
It's so hot.

482
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:21,980
Go. Go.

483
00:35:42,040 --> 00:35:43,990
Are you texting a report to your parents?

484
00:35:44,890 --> 00:35:46,510
Yeah.

485
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:49,800
Are you guys like together?

486
00:35:50,150 --> 00:35:51,470
Not yet.

487
00:35:51,470 --> 00:35:53,470
But close.

488
00:35:53,470 --> 00:35:55,470
Are you waiting for someone
to make it official for you?

489
00:35:55,470 --> 00:35:57,470
Official your ass.

490
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,600
I better eat some Fisho.

491
00:36:04,110 --> 00:36:05,710
- Dude.
- Hmm?

492
00:36:06,600 --> 00:36:07,960
Do you think...

493
00:36:09,130 --> 00:36:10,640
Eiw doesn't like me or something?

494
00:36:13,150 --> 00:36:14,560
Why do you ask?

495
00:36:15,080 --> 00:36:17,140
This morning I talked to him...

496
00:36:18,590 --> 00:36:20,070
He only answered me a few words.

497
00:36:20,070 --> 00:36:22,070
He didn't even look at my face.

498
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:25,050
Yeah.
You don't have to worry.

499
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,050
He's like that.
Not good at talking to people.

500
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:30,910
But I actually do worry about him.

501
00:36:31,860 --> 00:36:33,300
About not good at talking?

502
00:36:33,300 --> 00:36:35,300
Um. That too.

503
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:36,810
He's afraid of people.

504
00:36:36,810 --> 00:36:39,000
He doesn't like making new friends.
I'm worried.

505
00:36:40,330 --> 00:36:42,470
But he has Fee and Kung right?

506
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:44,470
True.

507
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:46,940
But is it enough just that?

508
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:50,160
Lots of people
only have a few friends.

509
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,330
But if he runs away
when there're a lot of people,

510
00:36:54,330 --> 00:36:56,330
don't like new changes...or....

511
00:36:56,330 --> 00:36:58,330
doesn't like going to unfamiliar places...

512
00:36:58,970 --> 00:37:00,330
isn't that a bad thing?

513
00:37:03,470 --> 00:37:05,070
It kinda is.

514
00:37:05,070 --> 00:37:07,070
And what does his family say?

515
00:37:08,910 --> 00:37:10,740
Youngest son kinda thing.

516
00:37:10,740 --> 00:37:13,610
Pao, his brother,
spoils him like rotten.

517
00:37:15,610 --> 00:37:17,620
You're dare to say this?

518
00:37:17,620 --> 00:37:20,170
It's you who spoil Eiw.

519
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:22,170
Don't you dare say that.

520
00:37:22,360 --> 00:37:23,820
But I think...

521
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:25,820
when he grows up,

522
00:37:25,820 --> 00:37:28,070
He'll have more friends.
You don't have to worry.

523
00:37:31,720 --> 00:37:34,940
It's not like
you can be with him forever?

524
00:37:34,940 --> 00:37:36,940
You need to have
your personal space too.

525
00:37:36,940 --> 00:37:39,370
But we never had personal space
to each other.

526
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:42,680
We'll see whether you'll say that
when we're grown ups.

527
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:46,940
Yeah. You're so grown up much?

528
00:37:47,910 --> 00:37:49,830
No I'm not.

529
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,830
But you have Rin now.

530
00:37:52,420 --> 00:37:53,830
What about her?

531
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,360
If you guys end up as a couple,

532
00:37:56,360 --> 00:37:57,900
you'll want to be together.

533
00:37:57,900 --> 00:37:59,900
Want to spend time together.

534
00:37:59,900 --> 00:38:01,240
Are you going to tag Eiw along...

535
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:03,240
as a third wheel,
isn't that weird?

536
00:38:17,850 --> 00:38:19,100
"Vajiravudh Scout Camp 1962"

537
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:32,160
Yay!

538
00:38:39,880 --> 00:38:41,450
Come on down.

539
00:38:54,230 --> 00:38:55,300
Hi!

540
00:38:55,940 --> 00:38:56,950
So slow.

541
00:38:56,950 --> 00:38:58,680
Button up please.

542
00:39:00,090 --> 00:39:01,880
Wear your beret properly.

543
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:03,880
Come on.

544
00:39:03,880 --> 00:39:05,880
- Let's go.
- Hey you. Wear your beret.

545
00:39:05,880 --> 00:39:07,880
Here wear it.

546
00:39:09,790 --> 00:39:12,540
- Go.
- I can't see shit.

547
00:39:12,540 --> 00:39:14,540
Peak come here.
Let me hold that.

548
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,600
Yeah let's go!

549
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:24,940
What do we do?

550
00:39:32,310 --> 00:39:34,310
Do we have all the veggies?

551
00:39:37,950 --> 00:39:39,590
Need anything else,
let me know.

552
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,620
- No. No. I'll carry that
- Hey.

553
00:39:45,220 --> 00:39:46,620
You can't carry this by yourself.

554
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:51,240
And why you're here?
Why don't you help them making omelette?

555
00:39:54,650 --> 00:39:56,590
There're a lot of people
over there already.

556
00:40:01,790 --> 00:40:05,280
Your hands are all dirty, let's go wash.
You face too.

557
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:07,280
How can you make such a mess?

558
00:40:07,910 --> 00:40:09,280
Look at your face first.

559
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:11,280
It's all over down to your cheek.

560
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:12,990
- I've got something on my face?
- Yeah.

561
00:40:12,990 --> 00:40:14,990
- Where?
- This side and that side.

562
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:16,990
No. No.
This side.

563
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,990
Up a bit.

564
00:40:18,990 --> 00:40:20,990
Here. Down here. No.

565
00:40:20,990 --> 00:40:22,990
This side.
Go to this a bit.

566
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:24,990
This side?

567
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:26,990
Here.

568
00:40:27,110 --> 00:40:29,200
Is it gone?
Off my face?

569
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:32,030
It's gone?
Then why are you laughing?

570
00:40:32,580 --> 00:40:34,030
Here.

571
00:40:34,510 --> 00:40:36,340
My hands are all dirty.

572
00:40:36,340 --> 00:40:38,340
So when I tried to clean it for you,

573
00:40:38,820 --> 00:40:40,340
I made it worse.

574
00:40:41,430 --> 00:40:43,360
You pranked me?

575
00:40:43,360 --> 00:40:44,270
No I did not.

576
00:40:44,270 --> 00:40:46,270
- You did.
- I did not. Really.

577
00:40:47,290 --> 00:40:49,310
- I didn't.
- Stop smiling...

578
00:40:49,510 --> 00:40:51,310
...then I'll believe you.

579
00:40:51,310 --> 00:40:52,240
See!

580
00:40:52,240 --> 00:40:55,000
You look like
you're from some tribe.

581
00:40:55,370 --> 00:40:57,580
You wanna be
on the same tribe with me?

582
00:40:57,580 --> 00:40:59,580
No. I don't.

583
00:40:59,580 --> 00:41:01,580
Cake!

584
00:41:06,480 --> 00:41:08,760
What's on your face?
You'll be itchy.

585
00:41:09,130 --> 00:41:09,920
No.

586
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:10,920
Really.

587
00:41:18,760 --> 00:41:20,080
Are you jealous?

588
00:41:20,650 --> 00:41:22,080
No.

589
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:26,760
Do they think they're here
just the two of them?

590
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,890
Where have you been Cake?
Why didn't you tell me. I'm worried.

591
00:41:52,890 --> 00:41:54,890
I went to talk with Rin.

592
00:41:56,400 --> 00:41:58,490
What's the matter?

593
00:41:58,490 --> 00:42:00,600
Am I still important for you?

594
00:42:01,790 --> 00:42:03,920
You're always important to me Eiw.

595
00:42:04,110 --> 00:42:05,920
Always...

596
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,420
There's no such time
where you're not important to me.

597
00:42:08,880 --> 00:42:11,600
Aren't you tired,
sitting here waiting for him everyday?

598
00:42:12,030 --> 00:42:14,260
That's fine. I can wait.

599
00:42:14,260 --> 00:42:15,850
I want to wait.

600
00:42:15,850 --> 00:42:17,850
I'm comfortable being like this.

601
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:21,370
Hi. I'm Sand.
