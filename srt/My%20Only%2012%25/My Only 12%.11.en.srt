1
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:05,430
What are you doin, Eiw?

2
00:00:05,430 --> 00:00:08,570
Oh Cake told me there’s a new show in IQIYI.

3
00:00:08,570 --> 00:00:10,690
I’m gonna watch the trailer.

4
00:00:10,690 --> 00:00:11,990
That's the popular app, right?

5
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:12,830
Yes. Yes. Yes.

6
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:14,110
People are talking about it a lot.

7
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:17,930
Yeah my mom loves
watching Chinese shows from there.

8
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:19,910
She always bawls her eyes out
watching it.

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:22,570
But lately,

10
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,850
you always talk about Cake.

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:24,880
Yeah.

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,310
That’s nonsense, Kung.

13
00:00:27,310 --> 00:00:29,090
We’re just close
since we were younger.

14
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:30,550
You know it!

15
00:00:30,550 --> 00:00:32,509
See...speaking of the devil!

16
00:00:32,509 --> 00:00:34,640
Oh hi Cake!

17
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,910
Hey.

18
00:00:36,910 --> 00:00:37,960
Gossiping about me?

19
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:40,080
There!

20
00:00:40,080 --> 00:00:42,150
I thought I was not gonna catch you guys in time.

21
00:00:42,150 --> 00:00:43,450
Thought you might be in the class already.

22
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:45,890
You are.
We just finished having lunch.

23
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:49,640
I bought you some donuts.

24
00:00:49,640 --> 00:00:51,600
My friend said this shop is really good.

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,160
Really? Let me see.

26
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,890
You eyes are sparkling more than me, Noey.

27
00:00:57,610 --> 00:00:59,130
Are you a foodie?

28
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,620
Looks so good!

29
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,710
Here.

30
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,940
You just ate the whole ice cream.

31
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:04,709
Still can eat more?

32
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:06,680
Easy peasy.

33
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:07,370
Oh.

34
00:01:07,370 --> 00:01:09,780
I will help myself then.

35
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,870
Go ahead.

36
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,810
Hey did you check out
the trailer of the show I told you?

37
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:17,850
I'm about to.

38
00:01:17,850 --> 00:01:19,850
Let's watch it together again.

39
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:23,690
Is it too loose?

40
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,520
Hey!

41
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,520
What are you doing?

42
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:19,280
I'm waiting for Eiw.

43
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:20,980
He's at the theater.

44
00:03:20,980 --> 00:03:23,579
You wait for him everyday?

45
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:26,880
Pretty much everyday,
whenever I'm free.

46
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,680
What about you?
You're heading home?

47
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,280
Yeah I am.

48
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,579
See you.

49
00:03:32,579 --> 00:03:36,120
Oh hey! Are you in a hurry?

50
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,950
-Why?
-  Can you take a look for me?

51
00:03:38,950 --> 00:03:40,579
What is it?

52
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,550
I cannot find any files in my handy drive.

53
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:49,380
I don't know why.
I already tried plugging it in and out.

54
00:03:49,380 --> 00:03:52,180
Oh it cannot read the files.

55
00:03:52,180 --> 00:03:55,180
The virus is hiding the files.
I'll fix it for you.

56
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,680
You probably download a lot of porns.

57
00:03:57,680 --> 00:03:59,079
Shut up.

58
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:02,050
Where is it?

59
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:04,550
Here they are!

60
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:07,950
Be careful next time,

61
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,550
especially uni's computers.

62
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:14,780
Hey thank you so much.

63
00:04:14,780 --> 00:04:16,279
What a relieved.
Luckily I've got you.

64
00:04:16,279 --> 00:04:17,750
Of course.

65
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,980
I'm gonna get going.

66
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:28,120
Oh actually,

67
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:35,080
were you always with Eiw, when I'm not around?

68
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:40,620
From time to time. Not always.

69
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:42,180
Why?

70
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,280
Well...

71
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:50,050
Is he always like this
when he's at university?

72
00:04:50,550 --> 00:04:53,250
What do you mean 'be like this'?

73
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,820
Like...

74
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,520
wherever he goes,
people know and say hi to him.

75
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:02,980
Not really.
He's always like this since high school.

76
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,420
Since he joined drama club.

77
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,620
And when he's now doing theater in uni.

78
00:05:08,620 --> 00:05:12,150
He also went to do a promote event or something.

79
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:14,150
That's why people know him more.

80
00:05:14,150 --> 00:05:16,320
Just like you. Activity kid.

81
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:18,620
People know you.

82
00:05:23,420 --> 00:05:24,980
That's true.

83
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:27,620
And...

84
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:30,250
What about Tal?

85
00:05:31,410 --> 00:05:33,180
How well do you know him?

86
00:05:34,750 --> 00:05:36,220
Tal?

87
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:41,820
Not much. I rarely talk to him.
I don't know what to talk to him.

88
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:44,380
But like you know,
he's the senior from his club.

89
00:05:44,380 --> 00:05:47,750
And when they got in uni,
still attend the same one.

90
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,750
That's why Eiw helped him a lot.

91
00:05:49,750 --> 00:05:52,250
People probably think that
Eiw is a Com. Arts student.

92
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:01,350
Hey.

93
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:04,880
Whatever you wanna know,
you can just ask me.

94
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:10,750
So...

95
00:06:13,220 --> 00:06:15,250
Is he trying to date Eiw?

96
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,150
I guess.

97
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,350
What do you mean?

98
00:06:23,750 --> 00:06:25,150
I don't know.

99
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,150
If you wanna know,
you can ask him.

100
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:29,150
Or you can just ask Eiw too.

101
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:31,120
Fuc...

102
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:33,320
Don't you dare smile.

103
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,220
I gotta go.

104
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:37,120
Ok ok.

105
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,120
I will go too.

106
00:06:40,280 --> 00:06:42,080
Keep it up my friend.

107
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,250
What the hell.
Get home safely.

108
00:06:44,250 --> 00:06:46,050
Yeah.

109
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,430
Can you open the door please?

110
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,030
Ugh stop stop.

111
00:06:56,030 --> 00:06:59,100
There's a bell at the door why don't you ring it?

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,830
Looks like you are from the country.

113
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:05,200
You smell like dirt road.

114
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:10,230
Err...My name is Meen.
I'm from Korat.

115
00:07:10,230 --> 00:07:12,830
I'm here to see Mrs.Penn.

116
00:07:12,830 --> 00:07:15,530
Can you open the door for me please?

117
00:07:15,530 --> 00:07:18,170
How come my mother knows someone like you?

118
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:20,600
Don't trick me.
Just go away.

119
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:23,500
What's happening?
Why are you guys so loud?

120
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,670
Nothing. Just a peasant came to the wrong house.

121
00:07:26,670 --> 00:07:28,130
I'm trying to get her out.

122
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:29,770
Err...I come to the right house.

123
00:07:29,770 --> 00:07:33,800
That's written as Mrs.Penn's house.
It's correct.

124
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:38,330
Err...That's right.
May I ask why do you need to see my mother?

125
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:40,230
But this peasant is...

126
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:42,600
It's okay brother.

127
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,370
Please come in.

128
00:07:44,370 --> 00:07:46,470
Fine come in.

129
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:52,900
Ok cut!

130
00:07:53,270 --> 00:07:54,530
How was it?

131
00:07:56,970 --> 00:08:00,370
The first time is probably a bit tensed.

132
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:02,030
Yeah for the first time,

133
00:08:02,030 --> 00:08:03,870
I think you guys did pretty good.

134
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:06,030
Let's talk about your characters.

135
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:07,600
All: Sure

136
00:08:07,930 --> 00:08:10,930
I think for you, always done a good job.

137
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:12,930
But you can go a bit further.

138
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:14,730
Just push more.

139
00:08:14,770 --> 00:08:16,300
Err excuse me Tal.
I'll be back.

140
00:08:16,310 --> 00:08:17,970
I will go see Cake for a min.

141
00:08:17,970 --> 00:08:19,340
I'll be back.

142
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,870
Cake!

143
00:08:30,270 --> 00:08:31,940
Are you bored?

144
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:34,169
Not at all.

145
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,140
I always finish kinda late.

146
00:08:37,140 --> 00:08:40,010
You have to work here everyday
because of me.

147
00:08:40,870 --> 00:08:43,140
You must be tired.

148
00:08:44,670 --> 00:08:47,970
You even came back
to pick me up again the other day.

149
00:08:47,970 --> 00:08:50,270
Instead of getting some rest.

150
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:54,570
Cause you always finish late,
that's why I'm here to pick you up.

151
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:57,310
I'm fine.

152
00:08:58,210 --> 00:08:59,840
Cake.

153
00:09:00,510 --> 00:09:04,770
You don't have to wait for me like this
from tomorrow onwards.

154
00:09:05,610 --> 00:09:07,510
You have lots of work to do.

155
00:09:10,040 --> 00:09:11,940
No.

156
00:09:12,610 --> 00:09:15,010
Cake listen to me.

157
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:15,970
Please do as I asked.

158
00:09:15,970 --> 00:09:18,040
It's you who needs to listen to me.

159
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:21,810
Going home alone at night is dangerous.

160
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:23,070
No it's not.

161
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:25,540
Here! There're so many people.

162
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,540
One more thing, if I really finished late

163
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:30,940
I could go home with Tal.
His place and mine are not so far apart.

164
00:09:30,940 --> 00:09:33,170
We always go home together,

165
00:09:33,170 --> 00:09:35,470
when we were in high school drama club.

166
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:38,040
You don't have to worry, okay?

167
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:39,740
You can be home and rest.

168
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:44,440
Okay?

169
00:09:48,290 --> 00:09:50,260
Is that what you want?

170
00:09:50,260 --> 00:09:51,260
Yes.

171
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:56,550
You want me to go home right?

172
00:09:56,550 --> 00:09:57,950
Yes.

173
00:10:03,950 --> 00:10:05,830
I'll just go now then.

174
00:10:05,830 --> 00:10:08,860
Huh are you going now?

175
00:10:09,490 --> 00:10:12,980
Um. I've got an assignment due.

176
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,980
I better go.

177
00:10:17,030 --> 00:10:18,180
I'm sorry.

178
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:21,350
Want me to walk you off?

179
00:10:22,290 --> 00:10:23,750
No, I'm okay.

180
00:10:24,950 --> 00:10:26,780
I'll call you.

181
00:10:43,950 --> 00:10:45,150
Eiw.

182
00:10:45,150 --> 00:10:45,780
Hmm?

183
00:10:45,780 --> 00:10:47,290
Where's Cake?

184
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:48,520
He already went home.

185
00:10:48,810 --> 00:10:51,040
But we almost finish.

186
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:52,750
isn't he gonna wait?

187
00:10:54,040 --> 00:10:56,720
Yeah I don't know.

188
00:10:58,090 --> 00:10:59,580
Are you guys fighting?

189
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:03,460
No, we are not.

190
00:11:04,180 --> 00:11:06,320
I'm just worried about him.

191
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,640
I don't want him to wait for me this long,

192
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,240
so I told him that...

193
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,640
he doesn't have to wait
from tomorrow onwards.

194
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:18,090
But I didn't think
he would not wait since today.

195
00:11:20,410 --> 00:11:22,660
So he's mad at you?

196
00:11:23,890 --> 00:11:25,750
And how are you going back?

197
00:11:27,060 --> 00:11:29,010
Probably with Tal.

198
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,210
Yeah probably because of this.

199
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:35,260
Hm what did you say Noey?

200
00:11:35,260 --> 00:11:37,750
Nothing.

201
00:11:40,290 --> 00:11:42,690
Let's rehearse.

202
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,380
Why are you going home with me today?

203
00:11:48,380 --> 00:11:50,380
Cake's not here?

204
00:11:50,950 --> 00:11:53,720
Yeah he already went home.

205
00:11:53,720 --> 00:11:56,550
He said he has some work to do,
so he left.

206
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,440
Oh.

207
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:01,900
Thought you guys are fighting or something.

208
00:12:03,380 --> 00:12:04,610
Do you mind I asked that?

209
00:12:04,610 --> 00:12:06,920
Not at all. You can ask.

210
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,300
We're not fighting.

211
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,180
Because since I've known him,

212
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,810
we never really fight.

213
00:12:12,810 --> 00:12:15,520
Hmm really? Not even once?

214
00:12:15,520 --> 00:12:17,870
Yeah not even once.

215
00:12:17,870 --> 00:12:21,040
Wow that's surprising.

216
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,380
I also have a younger brother.

217
00:12:23,380 --> 00:12:26,610
We grew up together,
but still fighting everyday.

218
00:12:26,610 --> 00:12:28,750
Fight a lot til we got bored.

219
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:32,070
I just think...

220
00:12:32,070 --> 00:12:35,410
Cake is so kind to me.
That's why we rarely fight.

221
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:43,410
You guys seem so close.

222
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:50,010
Yeah.
For me, Cake is super close to me.

223
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:55,270
That's nice. I actually have lots of friends.

224
00:12:55,270 --> 00:12:57,920
But probably not as closed as Cake and Eiw.

225
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,870
It's getting late. Are you hungry?
Wanna eat something?

226
00:13:03,870 --> 00:13:05,980
That's okay Tal.

227
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:09,010
I think we better not.
It's kinda late.

228
00:13:09,010 --> 00:13:11,920
You would be home late if we go eat.
I don't wanna take all your time.

229
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:15,810
You're always too considerate.

230
00:13:17,410 --> 00:13:18,580
Yeah.

231
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:21,470
You make me wonder.

232
00:13:21,470 --> 00:13:24,100
how would you act when you're being a brat?

233
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,100
Are you a head strong kid at home?

234
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,300
At home? Never.

235
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:32,840
It's Cake who is more head strong,
so I'm good compared to him.

236
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,870
Looks like Cake is a troublesome kid.

237
00:13:38,870 --> 00:13:39,980
He is like a lot.

238
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:43,700
He's always been like that
since he was a little kid.

239
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,810
But actually...

240
00:13:45,810 --> 00:13:47,980
I can be a brat sometimes with Cake.

241
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:53,900
To be honest,

242
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,870
you can also be a brat with me too.
I can handle it.

243
00:13:57,870 --> 00:13:59,470
I'm willing to.

244
00:13:59,470 --> 00:14:02,100
That's okay. Thank you.

245
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,610
I can't be stubborn with you.

246
00:14:04,610 --> 00:14:05,950
Don't worry.

247
00:14:05,950 --> 00:14:08,670
Let's go before it's getting late.

248
00:14:09,980 --> 00:14:11,610
And how was the play?
Was it ok?

249
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:13,900
It was okay.
I told you that you were doing fine.

250
00:14:13,900 --> 00:14:15,950
I was super nervous.

251
00:14:17,980 --> 00:14:19,890
So he never showed up again after that?

252
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:23,010
Yeah he's gone.

253
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,730
You pushed him away yourself.
Can't do anything.

254
00:14:26,730 --> 00:14:29,100
I didn't push him away.

255
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,980
I was just worried that he might be tired.

256
00:14:30,980 --> 00:14:32,810
From what you told me
it sounds like you did.

257
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:33,930
Um.

258
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:39,470
I already told him that I has to rehearse
till late night.

259
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:43,450
I saw him bringing work there
and I didn't want him to be tired.

260
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:45,030
Did he ever complain?

261
00:14:45,030 --> 00:14:46,920
Not really.

262
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:54,170
Don't chew me out.
I'm already stressed enough.

263
00:14:54,170 --> 00:14:57,320
I said all those
because I care about him.

264
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:00,290
I just don't want him to be exhausted.

265
00:15:00,290 --> 00:15:02,180
One more thing,

266
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,610
I don't want him to wait for me as well.

267
00:15:04,730 --> 00:15:06,730
Why?

268
00:15:06,730 --> 00:15:11,450
Don't you notice that all the girls in the club
can't concentrate on their work.

269
00:15:11,450 --> 00:15:15,880
They were all blushing
cause Cake was always staring at them.

270
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,390
Especially with Earn,
she kept saying how hot Cake is.

271
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:21,310
I don't wanna hear it.

272
00:15:21,310 --> 00:15:23,880
Doesn't everybody compliment him?

273
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:28,620
We even see his face on the university's page.
Aren't you used to it already?

274
00:15:30,650 --> 00:15:33,020
I don't know.
I'll never be used to it.

275
00:15:34,510 --> 00:15:38,560
So you're jealous. That's all.

276
00:15:39,560 --> 00:15:42,190
Just tell him,
so all these can be over.

277
00:15:45,480 --> 00:15:47,880
What about Tal?

278
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:50,510
Hm?

279
00:15:50,510 --> 00:15:52,190
What do you mean?

280
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:53,880
You know what I mean.

281
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:57,790
Yeah people can tell even from the Mars distance.

282
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:03,130
I already told him that he can't date me.

283
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:04,820
Did you really make it serious?

284
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:07,500
I was super serious. I said...

285
00:16:07,500 --> 00:16:09,620
YOU CAN'T DATE ME!

286
00:16:09,620 --> 00:16:10,820
And what did he say?

287
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:12,820
He didn't say anything. He was just laughing.

288
00:16:13,750 --> 00:16:15,130
Laughing?

289
00:16:15,540 --> 00:16:16,470
That's it?

290
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:18,270
That's funny.

291
00:16:19,720 --> 00:16:21,550
He should understand, right?

292
00:16:21,550 --> 00:16:23,010
Understand what!?

293
00:16:23,010 --> 00:16:26,720
Ugh don't start yet.
I'm still stressed.

294
00:16:28,490 --> 00:16:30,870
Do you think
Cake's gonna go date,

295
00:16:30,870 --> 00:16:33,870
flirt with or like someone else?

296
00:16:34,690 --> 00:16:39,290
This is Cake we're talking here.
How could he like someone else?

297
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:43,950
Or if he finds someone he likes like Rin
or even like more, what am I gonna do?

298
00:16:44,810 --> 00:16:47,180
And what are you gonna do
if he really does?

299
00:16:47,640 --> 00:16:50,120
What can I do besides let it go?

300
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,950
Nothing you can do.

301
00:16:51,950 --> 00:16:55,580
Why don't you just let him know
that you like him?

302
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,010
It's easy as we speak,
but it's difficult to do.

303
00:16:58,010 --> 00:17:02,950
I was so stressed
before telling just the two of you.

304
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,760
I was afraid that Kung might stop
being my friend.

305
00:17:05,730 --> 00:17:08,040
How is that gonna happen?

306
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:09,359
Cause I'm gay.

307
00:17:09,730 --> 00:17:13,300
Do I look like I'm a homophobic?

308
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:17,040
Most people are like that, aren't it?

309
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:19,069
People often think I'm abnormal.

310
00:17:19,069 --> 00:17:20,760
Not always.

311
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:23,640
And you cannot put yourself to be with
that kind of people.

312
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:25,359
If there're people like that,

313
00:17:25,359 --> 00:17:26,760
just don't be with them.

314
00:17:31,900 --> 00:17:33,810
Thank you so much.

315
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,960
So if everyone is homophobic,

316
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:38,610
I would have no one.

317
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:42,610
You still have me and Kung.

318
00:17:42,610 --> 00:17:44,070
The two of us.

319
00:17:45,810 --> 00:17:48,980
I appreciate both of you so much.
I'm gonna cry.

320
00:17:48,980 --> 00:17:50,640
-Really?
- Where're the tears?

321
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:54,640
My posture looks like a power ranger now.

322
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,100
No kidding.

323
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,840
I'm so overreacting.
Thank you you guys.

324
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:01,580
Can we please take a picture with you, Eiw?

325
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,760
Oh sure sure.

326
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:08,040
Where should we take?
Outside maybe?

327
00:18:08,040 --> 00:18:10,210
The lighting should be good.
I'll be back in a sec.

328
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:11,870
- You're so famous.
- Wait for me!

329
00:18:11,870 --> 00:18:13,870
- So famous
- Stop it.

330
00:18:22,210 --> 00:18:24,470
Whatever Cake is doing
is not obvious enough for him?

331
00:18:24,470 --> 00:18:27,160
I thought it's just me who thinks that way.

332
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:29,640
Everybody knows.

333
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:32,470
Only Eiw that doesn't have a clue.

334
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:35,580
Yeah how could he not know?

335
00:18:38,500 --> 00:18:39,580
Too innocent.

336
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:48,210
Oh mom.

337
00:18:51,330 --> 00:18:53,210
Are you alright?

338
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,210
I brought you some food.

339
00:18:55,210 --> 00:18:56,780
I'm alright.

340
00:18:56,780 --> 00:19:01,240
Rest more. I've seen you getting home
so late lately.

341
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:04,500
You don't get enough sleep.
That's why you're sick.

342
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:07,580
Sure thank you.

343
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:11,640
I haven't seen you
sleepover at Cake's lately.

344
00:19:11,640 --> 00:19:16,240
Oh I've been going home with Tal.

345
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,070
Cake has a lot of assignments.
I don't want him to wait for me.

346
00:19:20,070 --> 00:19:22,410
You guys are not fighting right?

347
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:25,560
Normally, the two of you never stay apart.

348
00:19:25,560 --> 00:19:28,240
We never fight and you know that.

349
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:30,300
Really?

350
00:19:30,300 --> 00:19:31,670
That's good.

351
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:35,900
Mom drink the water first.

352
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:37,010
That's okay.

353
00:19:42,470 --> 00:19:45,500
Did you loose some weight?

354
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:48,300
Have you been eating too little?

355
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:52,040
I've just been busy.

356
00:19:52,040 --> 00:19:54,270
Sometimes I just forget to eat.

357
00:19:54,270 --> 00:19:57,840
I also go do aerobic dance at the park.

358
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,130
I'm trying to be in a better shape,
isn't that good?

359
00:20:01,130 --> 00:20:05,180
Why though? You already look good.

360
00:20:05,180 --> 00:20:08,210
You like me being a little fat?

361
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:10,580
No.

362
00:20:10,580 --> 00:20:15,100
It doesn't matter.
I love you anyway.

363
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:19,410
But I think you've been coughing a lot lately.

364
00:20:19,410 --> 00:20:22,270
Let's go see the doctor with me sometimes?

365
00:20:22,270 --> 00:20:25,730
I'm fine. It's just the weather is changing.

366
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:28,070
Taking some medicine and I will be better.

367
00:20:29,870 --> 00:20:31,380
Buying medicines?

368
00:20:32,380 --> 00:20:35,330
Even you told grandma to go see the doctor.

369
00:20:36,270 --> 00:20:38,300
You're arguing with me now?

370
00:20:42,410 --> 00:20:46,360
Mom really. If it doesn't get better,
please go see a doctor.

371
00:20:46,360 --> 00:20:47,610
Sure.

372
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:51,070
Eat the food,
so you can take your medicines.

373
00:20:51,070 --> 00:20:53,530
Ok thank you.

374
00:20:54,530 --> 00:20:56,240
I'm gonna leave you to it.

375
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,180
You too.
Don't forget to eat.

376
00:20:58,180 --> 00:20:59,300
Sure. Eat up.

377
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:21,010
What's the matter Cake?

378
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:24,980
I've seen your mouth talking non-stop
since you got back.

379
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:32,400
Does the rehearsal usually last
the whole damn day?

380
00:21:33,220 --> 00:21:34,340
The play?

381
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:37,140
I think it's pretty tough.

382
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:40,770
The other day when I went drinking, I saw Fee...

383
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:42,770
got back pretty late.

384
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:50,470
Don't tell me that you're in my room every day...

385
00:21:50,470 --> 00:21:54,780
because you're mad at See-Eiw?
Cause he's been to the rehearsal?

386
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:57,670
You are such a baby, the more you grow.

387
00:21:57,670 --> 00:21:59,750
And you tell me that I'm a baby.

388
00:22:02,440 --> 00:22:04,530
When you're quiet like this,
you're mad for sure.

389
00:22:06,410 --> 00:22:08,040
It's just annoying.

390
00:22:09,470 --> 00:22:12,070
The play is not gonna be ruined,
if he rehearses less.

391
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,040
And you guys didn't talk?

392
00:22:16,040 --> 00:22:18,270
I do talk to him.

393
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,750
But just phone call is not enough.

394
00:22:20,750 --> 00:22:23,130
We used to see each other everyday.

395
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:27,410
Sleep next to each other every night
can't I just think that it's unusual for us?

396
00:22:27,410 --> 00:22:29,640
That was before uni right?

397
00:22:29,640 --> 00:22:33,440
You guys are all grown up.
How can you stick together at all time like you used to?

398
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:36,670
You were also gone for 3-4 years.

399
00:22:36,670 --> 00:22:38,870
It's normal that he has new groups of friends.

400
00:22:38,870 --> 00:22:42,470
You expect him to be your neighbor friend
and has only you all his life?

401
00:22:43,150 --> 00:22:45,330
So you're saying...

402
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:49,270
that he doesn't need me only anymore?

403
00:22:50,470 --> 00:22:52,750
I'm not as important as I used to be right?

404
00:22:52,750 --> 00:22:55,840
No. I meant...

405
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:59,550
He has his own things going on too.
Not that he doesn't care, but...

406
00:22:59,550 --> 00:23:02,410
he has to deal with his own stuff more, doesn't he?

407
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:07,180
Do you get what I'm saying?

408
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:11,410
You're making me sound like a fool.

409
00:23:12,500 --> 00:23:14,440
Why're you a fool?

410
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:19,840
Back then I told you that
I wanted him to have more friends.

411
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:21,840
Doing more activities,

412
00:23:23,150 --> 00:23:25,210
and not afraid of people like that.

413
00:23:26,380 --> 00:23:28,350
But when he actually made it happen,

414
00:23:30,010 --> 00:23:32,380
I ended up feeling unhappy about it.

415
00:23:32,980 --> 00:23:35,100
I have a bad thought came to my mind,

416
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:38,730
I actually want him to be the old See-Eiw.

417
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,780
Back to when he doesn't talk to other people,

418
00:23:44,040 --> 00:23:46,810
to when he doesn't attend or do any activities.

419
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:50,870
I just want him to be by my side only.

420
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:55,130
Need me only.

421
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,610
That's normal if you think that way.

422
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:04,900
But it's been a long time ago.

423
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:06,870
Eiw has changed a lot.

424
00:24:06,870 --> 00:24:10,240
You probably are not used to it.

425
00:24:10,900 --> 00:24:13,900
Take some time to adjust,
you'll be okay eventually.

426
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,180
Ok class dismissed.

427
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:33,250
See you next week.

428
00:24:37,530 --> 00:24:38,930
Are you going to see the play?

429
00:24:38,930 --> 00:24:40,870
Yeah it's about to start.

430
00:24:40,870 --> 00:24:42,240
You're not going?

431
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:43,840
I didn't buy the ticket in time.

432
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:46,350
This year it sold out really fast.
Too bad.

433
00:24:49,040 --> 00:24:50,100
Huh?

434
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:54,840
But today they will go out for drinks, wanna join?

435
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:56,840
Where? The same place?

436
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:00,070
Yeah, you didn't read the group chat for sure?

437
00:25:00,070 --> 00:25:01,580
I didn't.

438
00:25:01,580 --> 00:25:04,070
Let's discuss about this later.

439
00:25:04,070 --> 00:25:05,500
I gotta go.

440
00:25:05,500 --> 00:25:08,870
I already had a dinner plan with a friend too.

441
00:25:08,870 --> 00:25:11,640
Which friend? See-Eiw?

442
00:25:11,640 --> 00:25:13,500
Yeah why?

443
00:25:14,130 --> 00:25:16,410
Pu is like obsessed with him.

444
00:25:16,410 --> 00:25:20,040
Tell me that he's cute all day long.

445
00:25:20,040 --> 00:25:22,040
Is he single?

446
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:26,180
You should leave him alone. I gotta go.

447
00:25:26,180 --> 00:25:28,100
What? Are you jealous?

448
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:30,240
Yea I am. Why?

449
00:25:31,070 --> 00:25:35,150
- I'm leaving!
- I will tell Pu to buy things and bribe you.

450
00:25:35,150 --> 00:25:38,900
Hey just let me know your plan.
Call me!

451
00:25:39,580 --> 00:25:41,440
So rush.

452
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:47,780
Where's my pen?

453
00:25:49,950 --> 00:25:51,610
Did he take it with him?

454
00:25:55,210 --> 00:25:56,330
Here it is.

455
00:26:05,550 --> 00:26:08,240
- Shit...
-Cake you're so late.

456
00:26:08,270 --> 00:26:09,730
The professor let me go late.

457
00:26:09,730 --> 00:26:11,470
Did you bring the ticket?

458
00:26:11,960 --> 00:26:13,040
I did.

459
00:26:13,040 --> 00:26:13,810
Hurry.

460
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:16,190
Is it in my bag?

461
00:26:18,040 --> 00:26:20,020
Give me a min to find.

462
00:26:21,990 --> 00:26:23,330
Did you find it?

463
00:26:25,500 --> 00:26:27,590
Shit.

464
00:26:28,620 --> 00:26:30,040
What?

465
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:32,790
- Don't tell me that you forgot to bring it.
- Shit!

466
00:26:34,270 --> 00:26:35,930
I'm screwed.

467
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:38,160
Shit what should I do?

468
00:26:38,160 --> 00:26:40,190
Go check at your dorm.

469
00:26:40,620 --> 00:26:43,100
I'm not gonna make it.

470
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:46,130
What am I gonna do,
if Eiw doesn't see me in there?

471
00:26:46,130 --> 00:26:49,560
Calm down.
You don't have the ticket, you can't go in anyway.

472
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,420
The more you talk,
the more time you're wasting.

473
00:26:55,470 --> 00:26:56,760
Wait for me here.

474
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,360
I'll go get it from the dorm real quick.

475
00:26:58,360 --> 00:27:01,470
- You want me to go with you?
- No. Stay here. I'll be back.

476
00:27:01,960 --> 00:27:04,440
He's always like this.

477
00:27:18,300 --> 00:27:21,790
Tonight is more lonely than any other nights.

478
00:27:25,930 --> 00:27:27,620
It's cold...

479
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:29,620
...and deserted.

480
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:35,130
Only my own dreams...

481
00:27:35,130 --> 00:27:37,130
that always accompany me.

482
00:27:38,420 --> 00:27:41,590
No matter when I'm happy or sad...

483
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,930
when I close my eyes and dream about you...

484
00:27:47,730 --> 00:27:50,240
I won't feel lonely no more.

485
00:27:51,220 --> 00:27:55,870
I want to dream about you like this...forever.

486
00:28:02,530 --> 00:28:05,220
Hey! Have you seen my watch?

487
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:07,240
I put it here and here!

488
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:10,130
You brought it out from here and here.

489
00:28:10,130 --> 00:28:11,640
And where is it now?

490
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:14,640
I remember that I put it here and here.

491
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:15,790
and where could it be?

492
00:28:15,790 --> 00:28:17,130
You're the one who lost it.

493
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:20,100
and how can you ask me where is it?

494
00:28:22,760 --> 00:28:25,870
Enough the two of you!

495
00:28:25,870 --> 00:28:27,620
What!?

496
00:28:27,620 --> 00:28:30,840
It's right here on your arms.
Here and here.

497
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,670
Cake!

498
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:24,240
Cake.

499
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:25,020
Um.

500
00:29:26,160 --> 00:29:27,760
You're waiting for Eiw?

501
00:29:29,240 --> 00:29:32,700
Yeah. I'm waiting for him.
You can go.

502
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:36,560
That's fine.

503
00:29:36,560 --> 00:29:37,190
I can wait.

504
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,270
Overall today was okay, right?

505
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,530
But can I use the bathroom first?

506
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:45,870
You don't have to answer.

507
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:52,100
Oh thank you.

508
00:29:52,100 --> 00:29:54,240
Just coming to see me play
is more than enough.

509
00:29:54,240 --> 00:29:56,470
Oh ok thank you.
Thank you.

510
00:29:58,330 --> 00:29:59,900
Hello.

511
00:30:21,530 --> 00:30:22,360
Let's go.

512
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,590
Cake.

513
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:25,990
Err...but I haven't finished taking pictures.

514
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:28,470
You took a lot already.
Let's go.

515
00:30:31,290 --> 00:30:32,910
Um, I'll go now.

516
00:30:32,990 --> 00:30:35,670
I have an errand to do, would you excuse me?
I've gotta go.

517
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:39,220
I'm so late.
My friend is grumpy already. Bye bye!

518
00:30:41,390 --> 00:30:44,700
Cake. It hurts. I'm hurt.

519
00:30:47,270 --> 00:30:49,500
What's the matter?

520
00:30:49,500 --> 00:30:51,500
Why are you so upset?

521
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:53,760
Nothing.

522
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:58,130
And where have you been?

523
00:30:58,130 --> 00:31:00,420
Why did you show up
in the middle of the play instead?

524
00:31:00,420 --> 00:31:02,590
I was looking for you.
I couldn't find.

525
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:06,840
Were you looking for me?

526
00:31:07,990 --> 00:31:09,640
I did!

527
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:15,240
Don't tell me that you forgot?

528
00:31:16,840 --> 00:31:19,100
I told you so many times.

529
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:24,240
Am I still important to you?

530
00:31:25,960 --> 00:31:28,990
You're doing fine without me.

531
00:31:33,520 --> 00:31:35,780
Why are you saying that?

532
00:31:37,390 --> 00:31:39,290
I'm speaking the truth.

533
00:31:40,770 --> 00:31:42,490
I'm not so important to you anymore.

534
00:31:43,970 --> 00:31:46,520
What you said that 'only Cake is enough'...

535
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:49,370
is no longer true, isn't it?

536
00:31:52,990 --> 00:31:54,940
You really think that?

537
00:31:55,420 --> 00:31:57,020
And is it true?

538
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:02,070
Since I got back from America,

539
00:32:02,070 --> 00:32:04,070
you never care about me.

540
00:32:06,120 --> 00:32:08,120
You have so many friends now.

541
00:32:09,120 --> 00:32:11,040
People give you so much attention.

542
00:32:13,490 --> 00:32:16,190
I'm not as important as I used to be.

543
00:32:20,390 --> 00:32:22,570
You can live without me.

544
00:32:24,920 --> 00:32:26,890
You don't need me to take care of you.

545
00:32:26,890 --> 00:32:29,140
There're many people,
ready to do that for you.

546
00:32:33,470 --> 00:32:35,220
Yeah right.

547
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:41,890
When I'm not around,
you can go wherever you want alone.

548
00:32:43,170 --> 00:32:45,870
I don't have to be on the bus with you either.

549
00:32:47,640 --> 00:32:50,590
You don't need me to comfort you when you're sad.

550
00:32:54,540 --> 00:32:57,120
Now, having only Cake
is not enough for you, isn't it?

551
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:03,990
You've changed, right?

552
00:33:09,290 --> 00:33:10,840
It's you...who've changed.

553
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:12,740
How?

554
00:33:12,740 --> 00:33:15,690
I feel like I'm such a burden to your life.

555
00:33:15,690 --> 00:33:18,720
Were you saying all these mean things
to me back then?

556
00:33:21,670 --> 00:33:24,920
Did you ever do that to me in the past?

557
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:28,020
And what is this?

558
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,690
I did all of these,
isn't it because of you?

559
00:33:36,770 --> 00:33:38,120
I'm sorry.

560
00:33:38,120 --> 00:33:39,840
You don't have to...

561
00:33:40,120 --> 00:33:43,340
Let me go. I don't wanna talk to you right now.
I want to go home.

562
00:33:44,370 --> 00:33:45,970
Let me take you home.

563
00:33:46,790 --> 00:33:47,320
Please.

564
00:33:47,320 --> 00:33:50,070
I don't wanna see your face anymore.

565
00:34:23,620 --> 00:34:25,440
What the hell are you doing here?

566
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:28,020
Luckily, I saw Eiw walked out.

567
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:30,020
That's why I knew you're here.

568
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:32,020
His eyes were so red.

569
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,620
Fighting about something?

570
00:34:35,989 --> 00:34:37,620
Hey!

571
00:34:37,620 --> 00:34:39,620
Did you hear me?

572
00:34:45,590 --> 00:34:47,639
I made him cry.

573
00:34:48,340 --> 00:34:50,739
Cry? Wait...

574
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:53,440
What are you guys fighting about?
That you showed up late?

575
00:34:59,890 --> 00:35:01,270
I was mean to him.

576
00:35:01,270 --> 00:35:02,340
Huh?

577
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:07,020
And he also said that...

578
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:09,620
he doesn't wanna see my face anymore.

579
00:35:10,790 --> 00:35:12,270
You said it yourself...

580
00:35:12,270 --> 00:35:14,270
that you were mean to him first?

581
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,320
Eiw was probably emotional as well, wasn't he?

582
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:21,440
Hey!

583
00:35:22,740 --> 00:35:25,020
Why are you so worried?

584
00:35:27,540 --> 00:35:30,070
He never said to me that harsh before.

585
00:35:32,520 --> 00:35:36,140
He was disappointed,
not surprising that he said that.

586
00:35:37,090 --> 00:35:41,420
Wait until you calm down, and go talk to him again.

587
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,470
It used to be…

588
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,240
easier than this.

589
00:35:48,690 --> 00:35:51,790
You have fo stop bringing old stuff to compare.

590
00:35:51,790 --> 00:35:54,340
I understand that you guys were so close back then.

591
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:56,540
But you guys are all grown up.

592
00:35:58,420 --> 00:36:00,440
I don’t know.

593
00:36:00,440 --> 00:36:03,420
You know but you just don’t admit it.

594
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:07,570
The two of you are not high school kids anymore.

595
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:11,370
Is it weird…

596
00:36:11,370 --> 00:36:13,670
that I want to be like that with him
til we grow old.

597
00:36:16,420 --> 00:36:19,840
I don’t want the relationship
between me and him changes at all.

598
00:36:21,590 --> 00:36:23,620
No matter how grown up are we,

599
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:29,140
how grey my hair is, or even it turns grey the whole head,

600
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:31,140
I still want everything to be the same.

601
00:36:34,090 --> 00:36:35,540
You don’t get me.

602
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,040
I’m not okay.

603
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:54,940
I know. I understand.

604
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:05,040
Let’s just go back to your dorm first.

605
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:07,820
And you can call Eiw again later tonight.

606
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:13,170
No. I don’t wanna go back to my dorm.

607
00:37:14,740 --> 00:37:17,320
I think I will go see my friends from my faculty.

608
00:37:17,320 --> 00:37:19,020
You can go.

609
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:21,140
But I can go with you.

610
00:37:21,140 --> 00:37:22,470
That’s fine.

611
00:37:24,470 --> 00:37:25,390
I’m fine.

612
00:37:27,490 --> 00:37:28,640
You sure?

613
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:30,420
Yeah.

614
00:37:32,370 --> 00:37:36,040
If you need anything, just call me.

615
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,440
Okay.

616
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:41,670
You need to chill and calm down more.

617
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:50,290
Hello where are you, Eiw?

618
00:37:51,570 --> 00:37:53,870
I’ve arrived. I’m on my way.

619
00:37:53,870 --> 00:37:56,620
Oh ok. I’m waiting out front.

620
00:37:56,620 --> 00:37:58,990
Okay. See you.

621
00:37:58,990 --> 00:37:59,720
Okay.

622
00:38:09,510 --> 00:38:10,910
Are you Cake’s friend?

623
00:38:10,910 --> 00:38:13,610
Yeah. I’m Aut.

624
00:38:13,610 --> 00:38:15,010
Where’s Cake?

625
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,590
Here.

626
00:38:30,590 --> 00:38:32,590
Drunk as hell.

627
00:38:34,410 --> 00:38:36,690
Cake! Go home!

628
00:38:37,840 --> 00:38:40,240
I won’t.

629
00:38:41,140 --> 00:38:42,010
Cake!

630
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,990
See.

631
00:38:48,990 --> 00:38:50,990
He doesn’t wanna go home.

632
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:56,890
He’s so drunk. Just now…

633
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:59,760
he kept saying a name,
See-Eiw. See-Eiw. See-Eiw.

634
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:02,710
Thought he was hungry for some dim sum.

635
00:39:02,710 --> 00:39:04,510
So I gave him his phone.

636
00:39:04,510 --> 00:39:06,240
And he called you.

637
00:39:07,210 --> 00:39:08,890
Thank you, Aut.

638
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:10,890
That’s okay. I will handle him from here.

639
00:39:14,680 --> 00:39:15,600
Cake.

640
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:18,310
Cake.

641
00:39:18,310 --> 00:39:20,910
I said I’m not going home.

642
00:39:21,990 --> 00:39:24,740
Cake. It’s me.

643
00:39:24,740 --> 00:39:26,740
You called me, didn’t you?

644
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:29,990
Look at me.

645
00:39:32,590 --> 00:39:34,590
Why are you looking at me like that?

646
00:39:34,590 --> 00:39:36,160
Let’s go home.

647
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:38,990
I’m here to pick you up.

648
00:39:40,090 --> 00:39:41,410
I’m not going.

649
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:48,310
If you’re not going, you’re gonna sleep here?

650
00:39:49,690 --> 00:39:52,510
So I'll leave you here
and you go back home yourself then.

651
00:39:52,510 --> 00:39:53,740
Just leave me!

652
00:39:54,610 --> 00:39:56,860
You normally leave me anyway.

653
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,990
Here it comes!

654
00:40:02,510 --> 00:40:05,460
What are you talking about? Let’s go.

655
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,760
Go back home first and we will talk later.

656
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:09,760
Please.

657
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:19,440
Did you realize that…

658
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:22,990
I showered and was already in bed.

659
00:40:22,990 --> 00:40:26,560
I had to get dressed and come pick you up.
This is so ridiculous.

660
00:40:33,710 --> 00:40:35,840
Cake.

661
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,840
If you don’t get up, I’ll be upset for real.

662
00:40:40,440 --> 00:40:42,090
I don’t wanna go back.

663
00:40:43,590 --> 00:40:45,240
I will be alone when I go back.

664
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,410
So drama.

665
00:40:51,020 --> 00:40:53,470
Let’s talk at your room.
I'll stay with you tonight.

666
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:00,120
Really?

667
00:41:00,620 --> 00:41:02,220
Yeah. Come on.

668
00:41:04,470 --> 00:41:06,120
- Easy. You might faint.
-Let’s go.

669
00:41:06,120 --> 00:41:07,020
Go home.

670
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:09,350
You’re so heavy.

671
00:41:09,350 --> 00:41:11,650
I’ll help.

672
00:41:11,650 --> 00:41:13,420
You’re so heavy, Cake.

673
00:41:14,550 --> 00:41:15,450
This is Cake’s right?

674
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:16,800
Oh yes yes.

675
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:19,300
No don’t touch me, Aut.

676
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:21,770
I wanna hug Eiw.

677
00:41:22,220 --> 00:41:23,970
Let’s go.

678
00:41:23,970 --> 00:41:25,970
I’ll just help supporting you then.

679
00:41:25,970 --> 00:41:27,320
- Is the table all clear?
- Bro!

680
00:41:27,320 --> 00:41:29,000
I will come back and pay.

681
00:41:29,770 --> 00:41:31,300
Cake! Walk properly.

682
00:41:37,150 --> 00:41:38,600
Ok ok.

683
00:41:38,600 --> 00:41:39,550
You alright?

684
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:40,700
- Yeah. Yeah.
-Okay.

685
00:41:40,700 --> 00:41:42,700
Walk slowly.

686
00:41:42,770 --> 00:41:45,170
Hey don’t be touchy with me, Aut.

687
00:41:45,170 --> 00:41:47,370
Thank you so much for today, Aut.

688
00:41:47,370 --> 00:41:48,800
You’re welcome.

689
00:41:50,000 --> 00:41:51,400
Cake is also my friend.

690
00:41:51,400 --> 00:41:54,820
Hey! Who’s your friend?

691
00:41:55,250 --> 00:41:56,950
Cake come on. Let’s go home.

692
00:41:56,950 --> 00:41:58,950
Excuse us.

693
00:41:58,950 --> 00:41:59,850
Thank you so much.

694
00:41:59,850 --> 00:42:00,550
Ok ok.

695
00:42:00,550 --> 00:42:02,050
Cake hold on to me.

696
00:42:02,050 --> 00:42:03,370
Sure sure.

697
00:42:03,400 --> 00:42:04,850
I'm gonna go.

698
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,900
Looks like you’re gonna be heartbroken, Pu.

699
00:42:15,370 --> 00:42:17,400
One more floor and we will arrive.

700
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,470
Be careful.

701
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,950
Are you gonna make it?
Take the step.

702
00:42:22,950 --> 00:42:24,070
Two.

703
00:42:25,490 --> 00:42:27,690
Can I have the key? Your room’s key.

704
00:42:27,690 --> 00:42:28,490
Huh?

705
00:42:28,490 --> 00:42:30,840
Your room’s key. Can I have it?

706
00:42:31,010 --> 00:42:31,860
The key?

707
00:42:31,860 --> 00:42:32,610
Yeah.

708
00:42:35,960 --> 00:42:38,090
Hang on to the rail.
Cake hang on to it.

709
00:42:41,240 --> 00:42:42,290
Cake. Cake.

710
00:42:42,290 --> 00:42:43,590
We’re almost there.

711
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:47,710
Cake.

712
00:42:49,210 --> 00:42:50,910
Easy. Easy.

713
00:42:53,460 --> 00:42:54,810
Cake.

714
00:42:56,360 --> 00:42:58,160
Slowly. Don’t lay down just yet.

715
00:43:03,890 --> 00:43:05,540
Cake, move your arm here.

716
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:26,560
How much did you drink to be this drunk?

717
00:43:29,810 --> 00:43:32,190
You ever really care about me?

718
00:43:34,990 --> 00:43:36,390
What do you mean?

719
00:43:51,140 --> 00:43:53,060
I mean you...

720
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,210
ever actually care about me?

721
00:43:58,390 --> 00:43:59,440
Huh?

722
00:44:00,010 --> 00:44:02,740
Seems like I'm not so important to you anymore.

723
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,090
Who is it that actually not important?

724
00:44:09,160 --> 00:44:11,040
You were gone the whole week.

725
00:44:11,760 --> 00:44:14,610
You showed up late today
and were so mean to me afterwards.

726
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:17,440
Late night, you also went drinking.

727
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,210
And now you're talking like it's my fault,

728
00:44:20,860 --> 00:44:22,540
telling me that I don't care about you.

729
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:25,990
In fact,

730
00:44:25,990 --> 00:44:28,110
I should be the one who say all those,
shouldn't I?

731
00:44:37,110 --> 00:44:39,360
You pushed me away yourself.

732
00:44:42,460 --> 00:44:43,810
Huh?

733
00:44:46,290 --> 00:44:49,110
You've got so many people around you.

734
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:55,090
You are no longer the person
that I used to know.

735
00:44:57,890 --> 00:44:59,940
I'm not important to you, am I?

736
00:45:02,290 --> 00:45:05,210
What you said that 'only Cake is enough'
is not true anymore, right?

737
00:45:08,440 --> 00:45:10,360
You're saying this makes me really sad.

738
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:15,910
If you think that  way...

739
00:45:17,560 --> 00:45:19,860
you're also not the Cake
that I used to know either.

740
00:45:24,990 --> 00:45:26,760
I don't wanna talk to you anymore.

741
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,930
Will you be my boyfriend?

742
00:45:40,860 --> 00:45:42,650
Tell me everything!

743
00:45:42,650 --> 00:45:44,220
How did you end up being Cake’s boyfriend?

744
00:45:44,220 --> 00:45:46,080
Aren’t you afraid that other people will gossip?

745
00:45:46,080 --> 00:45:48,190
Just let them know that we’re dating.

746
00:45:48,190 --> 00:45:50,170
So nobody’s gonna try to be involved with you.

747
00:45:50,680 --> 00:45:52,030
I’ll see you tomorrow.

748
00:45:52,030 --> 00:45:53,600
Stop smiling.

749
00:45:54,620 --> 00:45:55,770
You are my everything, Cake.

750
00:45:56,720 --> 00:45:58,650
And I’ll be everything for you too.

751
00:45:58,940 --> 00:46:00,570
I love you, Eiw.

752
00:46:00,570 --> 00:46:01,930
…like a lot.
