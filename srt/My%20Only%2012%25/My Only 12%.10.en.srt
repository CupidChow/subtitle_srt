1
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:04,550
See-Eiw: Are you excited, Cake?

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:07,170
Cake: I am.

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,480
See-Eiw: Me too!
I wanna see you so bad.

4
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:12,600
Cake: I'll be there soon.

5
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:15,540
See-Eiw: Have a safe flight, Mr.Sweetie.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:18,850
Cake:  Roger that, Mr.Seasoning.

7
00:00:18,850 --> 00:00:20,600
See-Eiw: I'll be waiting.

8
00:00:36,010 --> 00:00:37,780
You can just put you luggages here.

9
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:42,180
Cake and Cream,
you can head to bed.

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,120
Let's go. The maid already changed
bed sheets for you.

11
00:00:46,010 --> 00:00:47,950
Just leave your stuff there.

12
00:00:47,950 --> 00:00:49,550
We can just deal with it later.

13
00:00:49,550 --> 00:00:51,900
Ok mom.
I'll go up and check out the room then.

14
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,550
Um go.

15
00:00:53,550 --> 00:00:55,320
Go get some rest, Cake.

16
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,210
Mom.

17
00:00:56,210 --> 00:00:57,100
Hm?

18
00:00:57,100 --> 00:00:59,100
Can I go see Eiw for a bit?

19
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:00,900
No. Go to bed!

20
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:03,200
You'll have to wake up again
in a few hours.

21
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,200
You have school stuff to get done first.

22
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,240
Please, I haven't seen him for 4 years.
I miss him.

23
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:13,460
Get some rest.
You need to go to the university in the morning.

24
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:15,740
You have to wake up in a few hours.

25
00:01:17,780 --> 00:01:19,120
Please.

26
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:20,480
Just a few hours.

27
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:21,460
Please. Please. Please.

28
00:01:21,460 --> 00:01:22,860
Go get some rest.

29
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:24,380
1 hour max.

30
00:01:24,380 --> 00:01:25,780
Please.

31
00:01:25,780 --> 00:01:26,620
Just 1 hour.

32
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:27,890
Go shower and get some rest.

33
00:01:27,890 --> 00:01:30,039
If you wanna go sleep at Eiw's,
that's another story.

34
00:01:30,039 --> 00:01:32,340
Go to bed.

35
00:01:34,789 --> 00:01:36,660
Get some rest.

36
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,820
-Go.
-Ugh mom.

37
00:01:37,820 --> 00:01:39,740
We can discuss later,
if you want to sleepover.

38
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,140
Go get some rest.

39
00:01:41,140 --> 00:01:42,740
Fine.

40
00:02:57,030 --> 00:02:57,880
Hello?

41
00:02:57,880 --> 00:02:59,510
Eiw!

42
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,620
Cake?

43
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:02,520
Um.

44
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:04,360
Where are you?

45
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:06,620
I'm at home,
been waiting for you to call me.

46
00:03:06,620 --> 00:03:08,620
You've been gone all day.

47
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,870
Sorry.

48
00:03:09,870 --> 00:03:11,870
I had to run a few errands.

49
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,840
I had to prepare some documents
and contacted university.

50
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:17,230
Also just got a new sim card
and I'm calling you first thing.

51
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,440
And is everything done?

52
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:22,380
Yep. All done.

53
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,380
And I'm going to see you now.

54
00:03:24,380 --> 00:03:26,940
Really!?
Hurry up and be here.

55
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:31,070
If I could go faster,
I'd be flying already.

56
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:34,190
That's why you should be back here
since last year.

57
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,280
Okayy. I'll go see you now.

58
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:40,750
Ok get here safely.

59
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:42,750
Um. See you.

60
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:44,750
See you.

61
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:22,940
Have you been eating, hm?

62
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:24,940
You're still skinny everywhere I touch.

63
00:05:25,690 --> 00:05:27,120
I do eat!

64
00:05:27,450 --> 00:05:29,630
Cake you've been growing a lot.

65
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,130
You are like a bear now.

66
00:05:37,650 --> 00:05:39,020
Did you get taller?

67
00:05:40,430 --> 00:05:42,000
A bit.

68
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:45,120
But I'm still shorter than you.

69
00:05:48,350 --> 00:05:50,080
This is already tall enough.

70
00:06:00,350 --> 00:06:01,580
I miss you.

71
00:06:09,850 --> 00:06:11,330
I miss you too.

72
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:21,520
Are you going to my place first?

73
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,860
Do you need to be somewhere today?

74
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,610
No, I don't have any plans.

75
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:27,790
I'm gonna sleep over tonight.

76
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:29,500
Here I brought my clothes with me

77
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:30,560
Really!?

78
00:06:32,650 --> 00:06:35,210
Shall we go find something to eat?

79
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:37,630
Have you eaten?

80
00:06:38,450 --> 00:06:39,490
Not yet.

81
00:06:39,490 --> 00:06:40,909
I'm super hungry.

82
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:42,909
Let's go eat.

83
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:46,570
Do you feel that it's too hot here
when you're back?

84
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:52,700
Thank you.

85
00:06:53,090 --> 00:06:54,050
Let me help.

86
00:06:54,050 --> 00:06:56,220
Hmm looks so yummy mom.

87
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,730
Eat up, Cake.

88
00:06:57,730 --> 00:06:59,390
Thank you.

89
00:06:59,390 --> 00:07:01,280
I was so surprised.

90
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:03,280
Woke up early to prepare stuff.

91
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,360
I still saw Eiw sitting in the living room.

92
00:07:06,480 --> 00:07:08,220
He did not just waking up early.

93
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:11,650
Last night when I got back,
the lights in Eiw's room were still on.

94
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,900
It was already midnight
and he was still up.

95
00:07:15,500 --> 00:07:17,950
He's too excited,
been waiting for years.

96
00:07:19,010 --> 00:07:21,500
You two!

97
00:07:21,500 --> 00:07:23,090
I wanted to come
since the morning.

98
00:07:23,090 --> 00:07:24,770
but I had to get uni stuff
done first.

99
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:26,460
By the time I finished,
it's already evening.

100
00:07:26,460 --> 00:07:28,060
How're your parents?

101
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:29,180
They're great.

102
00:07:29,180 --> 00:07:30,850
Mom and Cream flew back with me.

103
00:07:30,850 --> 00:07:33,390
Dad will probably be back next month.

104
00:07:33,390 --> 00:07:35,840
Are you planning to stay here long term?

105
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:36,650
Yes I am.

106
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,830
Dad got promoted again,
so we'll move back here.

107
00:07:38,830 --> 00:07:41,390
Cream will attend junior year
at her old school.

108
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:44,909
And are you going to attend
the same university as Eiw?

109
00:07:44,909 --> 00:07:45,740
Yes sis.

110
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:48,240
I'm applying for Coms Arts,
international program.

111
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:52,030
I thought you're gonna be back
and start at the same time as Eiw.

112
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:54,270
So you'll be graduating a year later then?

113
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:55,630
I thought so too at first,

114
00:07:55,630 --> 00:07:57,040
but we were caught up
with many things.

115
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:58,610
Too bad.

116
00:07:58,610 --> 00:08:01,420
Don't just keep talking guys.

117
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:03,580
Pass baby Cake some curry.

118
00:08:04,030 --> 00:08:06,590
- Ah eat eat.
- Got your turn and now you're mocking me.

119
00:08:06,590 --> 00:08:08,480
Here. For baby Cake.

120
00:08:08,480 --> 00:08:09,340
Thank you.

121
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,670
See even my sister still agrees.

122
00:08:10,670 --> 00:08:11,810
He can't stop smiling.

123
00:08:11,810 --> 00:08:13,090
- What mom?
- What?

124
00:08:15,390 --> 00:08:16,570
Nothing.

125
00:08:16,570 --> 00:08:18,720
Well baby Cake...

126
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,820
Here.

127
00:08:19,820 --> 00:08:21,070
Cake!

128
00:08:26,650 --> 00:08:27,980
Do you wanna shower first?

129
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:30,480
You go ahead first.

130
00:08:30,480 --> 00:08:31,260
I will go after you.

131
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,830
Ok.

132
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:42,799
Here.

133
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:45,330
I'll just put your towel here.

134
00:08:45,330 --> 00:08:46,170
Yes.

135
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,610
I'll be back.

136
00:09:13,450 --> 00:09:14,430
I'm done Cake.

137
00:09:14,430 --> 00:09:15,440
You can go shower.

138
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,870
Who is this?

139
00:09:22,490 --> 00:09:23,550
Which one?

140
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:24,080
This.

141
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:25,820
Oh!

142
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:26,890
That's Tal.

143
00:09:26,890 --> 00:09:28,890
I told you about him in the emails.

144
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:32,250
Tal?

145
00:09:32,250 --> 00:09:34,620
The senior from drama club
in high school?

146
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:36,490
Yeah.

147
00:09:36,490 --> 00:09:37,950
He studies Performing Arts.

148
00:09:37,950 --> 00:09:39,260
Same university with ours.

149
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:43,680
You've never told me about him.

150
00:09:44,890 --> 00:09:46,540
Really?

151
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:48,990
I think I told you about him before.

152
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:54,050
Do you see each other a lot?

153
00:09:55,100 --> 00:09:56,770
Quite often.

154
00:09:56,770 --> 00:09:58,770
I like to help with their projects.

155
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:05,040
And...

156
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:06,570
This guy?

157
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:08,570
-Which one?
- This one.

158
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:11,260
That's Noey.

159
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:14,190
Noey?

160
00:10:15,820 --> 00:10:18,570
I just met her
when I first got in uni.

161
00:10:19,950 --> 00:10:20,750
Oh.

162
00:10:21,410 --> 00:10:24,560
I think I sent you pictures of her before.

163
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,580
I don't remember.

164
00:10:27,580 --> 00:10:30,270
Introduce them to me sometimes,
would you?

165
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:33,490
Sure.

166
00:10:33,490 --> 00:10:35,490
Have you talked to Ta?

167
00:10:35,490 --> 00:10:37,290
that you guys are attending
the same faculty?

168
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:39,980
I talked to him
since before I got back.

169
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,690
But he said he'd skip and study
in normal program instead.

170
00:10:42,690 --> 00:10:44,690
So we're no longer studying together.

171
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:46,770
Go.

172
00:10:46,770 --> 00:10:48,290
But right now...

173
00:10:48,290 --> 00:10:50,220

174
00:10:50,220 --> 00:10:51,790
Come on.

175
00:10:51,790 --> 00:10:53,410
Hm. You're stink.

176
00:10:53,410 --> 00:10:55,650
Go come on!
Go. Go.

177
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,620
Take this with you.
Go.

178
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,810
Are you going to sleep right away?

179
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:47,580
Turn off the lights for me please.

180
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:12,940
Cake?

181
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:15,230
Hm?

182
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,250
Cake.

183
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,520
Um.

184
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,300
What's up?

185
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:26,300
Why did you call me
and didn't say anything?

186
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,410
Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake. Cake.

187
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,380
What?

188
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,300
Answer me.

189
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:44,300
Keep answering me.

190
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,230
Answer me every time I call you, please.

191
00:12:49,670 --> 00:12:51,010
Um.

192
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:53,500
I will answer you every time you call out my name.

193
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:11,520
Could you please
stay and answer me like this forever?

194
00:13:14,030 --> 00:13:16,160
Don't go anywhere ever again.

195
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:25,720
Sure.

196
00:13:25,720 --> 00:13:26,900
I'm not going anywhere.

197
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:34,810
Promise?

198
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:38,070
Promise?

199
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,070
I promise.

200
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,100
Wanna cuddle?

201
00:14:13,320 --> 00:14:14,500
It hurts.

202
00:14:16,980 --> 00:14:19,320
You're still teasing me as usual.

203
00:14:24,470 --> 00:14:25,610
Yes.

204
00:14:27,940 --> 00:14:30,430
Yeah sure.

205
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,650
I will ask them for you again, Tal.

206
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,670
Sure sure.

207
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,980
Oh really?

208
00:14:47,580 --> 00:14:50,140
Ok I'll talk to them for you.

209
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:52,810
I'll talk to Fee and Kung for you.

210
00:14:55,520 --> 00:14:57,380
Sure.

211
00:14:58,470 --> 00:15:01,010
Ok. You don't have to worry about this side.

212
00:15:01,010 --> 00:15:03,430
I'll arrange for you.

213
00:15:04,430 --> 00:15:07,900
Oh sure.

214
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:09,650
It will be on...

215
00:15:12,010 --> 00:15:14,830
Ok ok. I'l check for you.

216
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:15,980
Sure.

217
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,740
Eiw, I cannot find the socks.

218
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,500
If Friday...

219
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:24,700
Friday, I'm not sure.

220
00:15:24,700 --> 00:15:25,760
Eiw.

221
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,940
Okay sure.

222
00:15:28,580 --> 00:15:32,070
I'm not sure about Friday.

223
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:34,720
- But I'm free on Saturday.
- Eiw!

224
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:35,900
Hang on a sec, Tal.

225
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:38,610
What's up Cake?

226
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:40,610
I said I cannot find the socks.

227
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,010
Can you hang up the phone first!?

228
00:15:43,010 --> 00:15:44,780
Um sure sure.

229
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:47,450
I gotta go Tal.

230
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:50,360
I will send you the detail on LINE. (texting app).

231
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,980
Yes bye.

232
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,960
What Cake?

233
00:15:57,940 --> 00:15:59,160
What are you looking for?

234
00:16:00,270 --> 00:16:01,980
Socks?

235
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:08,720
What's the matter?
Why are you so grumpy?

236
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:10,430
Stop it.

237
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,740
You're always on your phone.

238
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:15,790
Since I got back,
I only see you talking on the phone.

239
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:19,700
I'm talking about work, Cake.

240
00:16:21,830 --> 00:16:23,630
I cannot find the grey socks.

241
00:16:24,820 --> 00:16:26,950
If your socks, here Cake.

242
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:29,160
It's on the top drawers here.

243
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,040
Here...did you really look?

244
00:16:33,200 --> 00:16:35,080
I don't know. I couldn't find it.

245
00:16:37,640 --> 00:16:39,220
Come on.

246
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:41,220
Just wear it.

247
00:16:41,520 --> 00:16:44,500
It's almost noon
and you haven't eaten anything.

248
00:16:45,740 --> 00:16:47,590
I'm jet-lagged.

249
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,200
Still adjusting.

250
00:17:00,800 --> 00:17:02,840
You've been adjusting for so long, sweetie.

251
00:17:02,840 --> 00:17:03,780
Blehh.

252
00:17:05,040 --> 00:17:05,950
Stop!

253
00:17:05,950 --> 00:17:06,310
Huh?

254
00:17:06,310 --> 00:17:08,310
- You're ruining my hair.
- Come on. Hurry up.

255
00:17:08,310 --> 00:17:10,420
You're so slow.

256
00:17:11,670 --> 00:17:13,400
You're mocking me?

257
00:17:18,069 --> 00:17:19,420
Here I am.

258
00:17:21,069 --> 00:17:22,750
You wanna try, Cake?

259
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:24,040
I'm still full.

260
00:17:24,660 --> 00:17:26,040
Try it. It's good.

261
00:17:42,940 --> 00:17:43,950
Don't you wanna try?

262
00:17:45,880 --> 00:17:47,350
It's almost gone.

263
00:17:47,630 --> 00:17:49,140
Here.

264
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,640
Help me. Come on.

265
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:52,830
I'm full already please.

266
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:55,100
Beg me nicely.

267
00:17:56,070 --> 00:17:57,180
Cake come on!

268
00:17:57,180 --> 00:17:57,910
Beg me now.

269
00:17:57,910 --> 00:18:00,030
-Help me eat.
- If you want me to eat then beg me.

270
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:01,180
Help me eat please.

271
00:18:01,180 --> 00:18:02,270
Beg me again.

272
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,880
Sure help me please.

273
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:07,150
Here that's good.

274
00:18:07,150 --> 00:18:08,300
One more bite.

275
00:18:08,300 --> 00:18:10,460
Come on, there're still some left.

276
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:11,980
Here.

277
00:18:13,300 --> 00:18:14,230
Good?

278
00:18:17,190 --> 00:18:19,900
- Clean this up.
- That's so cute. You look like a reindeer.

279
00:18:19,900 --> 00:18:21,270
It's cute.

280
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:22,920
So cute.

281
00:18:22,920 --> 00:18:24,220
Cute.

282
00:18:24,790 --> 00:18:26,220
Ok. ok. Here.

283
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,500
Clean it.

284
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,580
-Ok now it's clean.
-Is it gone?

285
00:18:28,580 --> 00:18:29,880
It is.

286
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:32,080
It's not. Still feeling the wetness here.

287
00:18:32,190 --> 00:18:35,100
- Really? I'm looking and there's nothing on your mouth.
- Clean it for me.

288
00:18:35,350 --> 00:18:36,470
I'll be mad,
if you don't clean it.

289
00:18:36,470 --> 00:18:37,480
Give it to me.

290
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,520
Look!
Here.

291
00:18:42,910 --> 00:18:44,220
Move up a bit.

292
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:45,980
Further.

293
00:18:45,980 --> 00:18:47,710
It's not there yet, Cake.
Higher.

294
00:18:50,270 --> 00:18:51,780
What do you wanna buy?

295
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,990
I want 3 T-shirts.

296
00:18:54,990 --> 00:18:56,990
A jacket and a hat too.

297
00:18:56,990 --> 00:18:58,380
Oh sure.

298
00:18:58,380 --> 00:19:00,190
Are you done setting up your dorm?

299
00:19:00,190 --> 00:19:02,340
Do you need anything else
from the super market?

300
00:19:02,340 --> 00:19:04,340
Mom prepared everything for me already.

301
00:19:04,340 --> 00:19:06,340
Once uni starts, I can just move in.

302
00:19:06,340 --> 00:19:09,630
You had you mom prepared things
for you like a kid, sweetie.

303
00:19:09,630 --> 00:19:11,230
Stop it.

304
00:19:11,230 --> 00:19:12,550
Just choose the shirt.

305
00:19:16,980 --> 00:19:17,880
This one.

306
00:19:18,790 --> 00:19:19,880
Too bland.

307
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:21,980
But looks good. It's cute.

308
00:19:21,980 --> 00:19:23,980
- Too bland? I think it's cool.
- This one!

309
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:27,470
No.

310
00:19:27,470 --> 00:19:28,280
This is the one.

311
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:29,740
I feel like a pumpkin
wearing this one.

312
00:19:31,740 --> 00:19:33,340
- Put it back.
- It looks so lively.

313
00:19:33,340 --> 00:19:33,860
What about red?

314
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:35,860
No no. I don't want it.

315
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:37,860
I want black ones.

316
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,110
Black.

317
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:43,660
You wanna look so cool, sweetie?

318
00:19:43,660 --> 00:19:45,790
Here this one.

319
00:19:45,790 --> 00:19:46,180
Sure.

320
00:19:46,180 --> 00:19:48,120
I think this one is good.

321
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:48,680
Sure.

322
00:19:48,680 --> 00:19:50,390
Here try one more.

323
00:19:50,390 --> 00:19:52,260
You've got a few dark ones already.

324
00:19:52,910 --> 00:19:53,990
Here.

325
00:19:54,750 --> 00:19:57,430
It would be perfect with a pair of jeans.

326
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,700
Fine.

327
00:19:58,700 --> 00:19:59,190
Okay.

328
00:19:59,190 --> 00:20:00,920
Ok I'll go try these 3 on.

329
00:20:00,920 --> 00:20:02,910
What about some pants?

330
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,860
Don't go try it on yet...

331
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:06,200
The pants...

332
00:20:09,340 --> 00:20:10,340
This one?

333
00:20:10,340 --> 00:20:11,360
-Good.
- Isn't it?

334
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:12,200
Good good.

335
00:20:12,200 --> 00:20:13,910
You will look cool on this one.

336
00:20:13,910 --> 00:20:16,350
I wanna look cool wearing it like you.

337
00:20:16,920 --> 00:20:18,550
You're already perfect
just the way it is.

338
00:20:19,160 --> 00:20:20,550
I will go try these on.

339
00:20:20,840 --> 00:20:21,470
Go.

340
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:23,240
Hurry up.

341
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,340
I'll wait here.

342
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:25,900
Sure.

343
00:20:36,160 --> 00:20:39,240
Ugh the weather is so hot.

344
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:40,260
Yeah.

345
00:20:43,220 --> 00:20:45,280
You're playing like a kid.

346
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,830
You're a grown up now.

347
00:20:53,960 --> 00:20:55,340
Did you just blow water
with the straw?

348
00:20:57,190 --> 00:20:58,320
Damn!

349
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:00,380
What?

350
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:01,190
I'm going home.

351
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:04,280
Yeah. You got back 2 weeks ago,

352
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:06,830
but you haven't come see your friends.

353
00:21:06,830 --> 00:21:09,950
Even I'm in the same uni with him.

354
00:21:09,950 --> 00:21:11,700
He doesn't even get excited.

355
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,990
Yeah he doesn't miss his friends as much.

356
00:21:13,990 --> 00:21:17,780
Friends doesn't 'last long'.

357
00:21:17,780 --> 00:21:22,100
But the word friend for See-Eiw
can last super 'Longggg'

358
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:24,100
Is your name See-Eiw?

359
00:21:24,670 --> 00:21:26,040
End of convo.

360
00:21:27,340 --> 00:21:29,580
Smart mouth.

361
00:21:29,580 --> 00:21:31,680
- Come here.
- How am I relevant in this?

362
00:21:31,680 --> 00:21:33,670
You're so sarcastic.

363
00:21:34,580 --> 00:21:35,990
You too.

364
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:41,390
Let me ask you one thing,
do you even remember our names?

365
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,160
What's my name?

366
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:46,060
I do. You're...

367
00:21:47,220 --> 00:21:48,160
Peak!

368
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,580
I'm Peak!

369
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:52,030
You're so done.

370
00:21:52,030 --> 00:21:53,680
And how are you guys?

371
00:21:53,680 --> 00:21:55,190
Haven't seen each other for so long.

372
00:21:55,190 --> 00:21:57,190
Got any girlfriends?

373
00:21:57,190 --> 00:21:58,980
Not even close.

374
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:01,150
For me...

375
00:22:01,150 --> 00:22:02,510
I called everyday,

376
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:03,670
bought so many meals,

377
00:22:03,670 --> 00:22:06,100
took to places, all she said was I'm just a brother to her.

378
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,600
It drove me crazy.

379
00:22:08,870 --> 00:22:12,660
All my friends acting so inexperienced
like this huh?

380
00:22:12,660 --> 00:22:17,160
That's fine. I've still got this Casanova.

381
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,950
- This one? Let me say something.
- Yeah this one.

382
00:22:19,950 --> 00:22:20,870
What is it?

383
00:22:20,870 --> 00:22:23,070
His old habits are all gone.

384
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,820
He's too conservative now.

385
00:22:25,820 --> 00:22:28,060
Really!?

386
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:31,870
Did you know that
he also doesn't look at girls anymore.

387
00:22:31,870 --> 00:22:33,230
Focus on the study.

388
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:34,950
Be a good guy.

389
00:22:34,950 --> 00:22:36,430
I thought he was gonna ordain.

390
00:22:37,220 --> 00:22:38,350
Reverend?

391
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:40,150
- Amen.
- Stop it you guys.

392
00:22:40,150 --> 00:22:42,040
You guys should focus on the study too.

393
00:22:42,040 --> 00:22:44,100
So all the paid tuition fee will be worthwhile.

394
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:45,280
I'm not listening.

395
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:46,970
Me neither.

396
00:22:47,160 --> 00:22:50,200
- That's not my friend.
- Yeah not the guy I know. I don't wanna listen.

397
00:22:50,200 --> 00:22:51,260
I can't take this.

398
00:22:51,260 --> 00:22:52,160
My friend has changed.

399
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:53,940
Take me to America with you.

400
00:22:55,940 --> 00:22:57,990
I was just bored.
How is that weird?

401
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,600
It is.

402
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:03,240
I think you were not really bored,

403
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,540
but you changed because of someone.

404
00:23:07,030 --> 00:23:07,830
Who!?

405
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:08,600
Yeah.

406
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:09,920
Who?

407
00:23:09,920 --> 00:23:11,300
Who? Helps me think.

408
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:13,000
Who could it be?

409
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:15,630
- Why aren't you smart with some other topics?
- Blah. Blah.

410
00:23:17,350 --> 00:23:18,800
You are such a moron.

411
00:23:20,380 --> 00:23:21,900
Yeah like that.

412
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,900
Friends doesn't last long.

413
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Yeah. Yeah.

414
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:26,910
Right.

415
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:32,470
Cake wake up. It's 7ish already.

416
00:23:32,470 --> 00:23:35,220
I have an 8am class.
Hurry up.

417
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:36,860
Get up.

418
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:40,430
We've started uni for a week already,
still waking up so late.

419
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:43,350
You said you only need a few days
to adjust the jet lag.

420
00:23:43,350 --> 00:23:46,420
If I didn't spend a night here,
how could you wake up huh?

421
00:23:46,420 --> 00:23:48,310
Then always be here.

422
00:23:48,310 --> 00:23:49,840
Get up now.

423
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,230
Calm down.

424
00:23:56,660 --> 00:23:59,320
I can finish getting dress in only 10 mins.

425
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,380
The dorm is so close to the uni.

426
00:24:01,380 --> 00:24:03,110
We will be there in just 2 blinks.

427
00:24:03,470 --> 00:24:04,390
Stop talking.

428
00:24:04,390 --> 00:24:07,380
You could finish the shower
instead of sitting here talking nonsense.

429
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,110
Get up.

430
00:24:09,110 --> 00:24:09,480
Get up!

431
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,480
Fine. Fine.

432
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:16,840
You're still a sleepyhead.
Never changed.

433
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:18,900
I'm going.

434
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,760
Hurry up Cake!

435
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:56,980
I thought I was gonna be more late.

436
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:00,870
Is he still jet-lagged?

437
00:25:02,860 --> 00:25:06,540
If waking up late is the jet-lag,
then he'd probably be adjusting his whole life.

438
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:12,200
So you have to wake him
since high school until now?

439
00:25:13,640 --> 00:25:16,080
Probably til he graduates.

440
00:25:18,900 --> 00:25:20,070
Where are we?

441
00:25:20,070 --> 00:25:21,320
Page 2.

442
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:23,720
Oh page 2 already.
Did the professor already name check?

443
00:25:23,720 --> 00:25:24,820
Yes.

444
00:25:37,180 --> 00:25:39,000
Cake is not gonna have lunch with us?

445
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:42,120
Yeah he texted me that he will be
outside the uni today.

446
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:45,030
And what did you tell him...

447
00:25:45,030 --> 00:25:47,030
about faculty play?

448
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:50,120
Oh I said no problems.

449
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:52,580
but this week I will confirm with Tal again.

450
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,780
I'm still waiting
for your answer as well Noey.

451
00:25:55,600 --> 00:25:58,020
I already asked my mom.

452
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:59,800
She's fine with it.

453
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:00,660
Really?

454
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:04,310
She just said that
don't let it affect the study that's all.

455
00:26:04,660 --> 00:26:06,750
Good, so I won't be alone.

456
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,260
Hm?

457
00:26:08,260 --> 00:26:10,800
Have you actually
ever been alone?

458
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,900
I never see you're alone...

459
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:14,420
whenever we go to that faculty.

460
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:16,420
They are seniors from my high school.

461
00:26:16,420 --> 00:26:18,230
I happens to know a lot of them.

462
00:26:18,230 --> 00:26:20,470
Seniors huh?

463
00:26:20,990 --> 00:26:23,360
- What?
- Just a senior right?

464
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:24,380
What...stop...

465
00:26:24,380 --> 00:26:25,550
Ughh so hungry.

466
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:26,840
Hey Kung!

467
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,940
You're so late.
Thought you're not gonna have lunch with us.

468
00:26:29,940 --> 00:26:32,310
Even I'm late,
you guys are not even half way of the plate.

469
00:26:32,880 --> 00:26:34,660
We're absorbing the taste.

470
00:26:35,040 --> 00:26:36,640
- More like ruminating.
- What?

471
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:38,680
- Ruminating?
- Just ruminating.

472
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,660
Ugh you guys are arguing like a child.

473
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,990
Enough.
Stop arguing.

474
00:26:41,990 --> 00:26:44,540
Go buy your lunch.
and why're you late, Kung?

475
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:46,320
The professor let us go late.

476
00:26:46,320 --> 00:26:48,140
I'm starving.

477
00:26:48,140 --> 00:26:48,990
I will go order food.

478
00:26:48,990 --> 00:26:50,320
-Okay.
- Go go go.

479
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:51,270
- What?
- Go go go.

480
00:26:51,270 --> 00:26:53,020
Ow! Just go!

481
00:26:57,940 --> 00:26:59,630
- Go go.
- So sweet.

482
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:01,900
What sweet?

483
00:27:01,900 --> 00:27:03,440
You two.

484
00:27:03,440 --> 00:27:06,100
- What!?
- Oh I meant the drink.

485
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:08,180
I'm still not done with the senior topic.

486
00:27:08,180 --> 00:27:10,240
Don't change the subject.

487
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:10,980
What?

488
00:27:12,820 --> 00:27:15,630
Financial Statement that shows financial status

489
00:27:15,630 --> 00:27:18,500
and how the company performs.

490
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,740
That’s all for today.

491
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:23,420
See you again next week.

492
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:24,740
Thank you.

493
00:27:28,910 --> 00:27:30,520
Are you going straight to the dorm?

494
00:27:30,520 --> 00:27:31,880
Um I think I’ll just go back.

495
00:27:31,880 --> 00:27:33,310
Cake is waiting for me downstairs.

496
00:27:34,990 --> 00:27:37,600
You guys are like attached to each other.

497
00:27:38,480 --> 00:27:39,680
You’re talking too much Noey.

498
00:27:39,680 --> 00:27:41,680
I’m not attached to him.

499
00:27:42,150 --> 00:27:44,320
Since Cake got back,

500
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:46,530
you always smile all the time.

501
00:27:46,530 --> 00:27:48,210
Been in such a good mood.

502
00:27:48,210 --> 00:27:50,120
Last year you were depressed still.

503
00:27:50,120 --> 00:27:52,520
You were complaining
missing him non-stop.

504
00:27:52,920 --> 00:27:54,720
It’s not like that, Noey.

505
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,810
I waited for 4 years.

506
00:27:57,810 --> 00:28:00,570
He’s finally back.
Do you expect me make a grumpy face?

507
00:28:00,570 --> 00:28:02,140
I have to be glad, right?

508
00:28:03,700 --> 00:28:05,920
Why’re you smiling?
You’re blushing!

509
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:07,110
I’m not.

510
00:28:07,110 --> 00:28:09,110
You are!

511
00:28:09,110 --> 00:28:11,250
Let's go.

512
00:28:35,500 --> 00:28:37,790
Are you Cake from Com Arts,
international program?

513
00:28:39,030 --> 00:28:40,400
Oh yes.

514
00:28:41,180 --> 00:28:43,170
What are you doing here then?

515
00:28:43,950 --> 00:28:45,470
I’m waiting for a friend.

516
00:28:47,670 --> 00:28:48,900
I’m Aoey.

517
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,580
I'm from this faculty.

518
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,590
You’re in international program,

519
00:28:56,590 --> 00:28:59,150
that means your English must be really good?

520
00:28:59,150 --> 00:29:01,020
I'm kinda okay.

521
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:04,060
I went to high school in America.

522
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,820
Oh really?

523
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:08,140
Whenever there's an exam,

524
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:10,140
I'm always doomed with English.

525
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,260
Could you...

526
00:29:15,260 --> 00:29:17,480
Oh! my friend is here.
I gotta go.

527
00:29:18,280 --> 00:29:19,300
Bye bye.

528
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:27,390
I thought I would have to wait.

529
00:29:29,290 --> 00:29:30,530
You're done with classes?

530
00:29:31,450 --> 00:29:33,140
If not, I wouldn't be here.

531
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:36,440
You argue back so much these days.

532
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:38,730
You always smack me.
It hurts.

533
00:29:39,530 --> 00:29:42,020
Just kidding,
how long have you waited for me?

534
00:29:44,800 --> 00:29:47,140
To be honest, almost fall asleep
if I had to wait a bit longer.

535
00:29:47,380 --> 00:29:48,900
You're exaggerating.

536
00:29:49,080 --> 00:29:50,900
Only waiting for a bit.

537
00:29:51,380 --> 00:29:53,060
Did you finish early today?

538
00:29:53,270 --> 00:29:54,540
Class got cancelled.

539
00:29:56,050 --> 00:29:58,450
And why didn't you go eat with friends today?

540
00:29:58,450 --> 00:30:01,260
Normally you're always
occupied, Mr.freshie.

541
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:04,130
Don't mock me.

542
00:30:04,130 --> 00:30:05,230
Why?

543
00:30:05,230 --> 00:30:07,490
I just wanna pick up a sophomore, can I?

544
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:09,780
Sure.

545
00:30:10,270 --> 00:30:11,780
Let's go. Shall we go back?

546
00:30:11,780 --> 00:30:13,230
Freshman Cake.

547
00:30:14,710 --> 00:30:16,320
Who's freshman?

548
00:30:17,490 --> 00:30:18,980
Are you hungry?

549
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:21,130
Yeah a bit.

550
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,180
We can find something to eat
near your dorm.

551
00:30:24,770 --> 00:30:27,070
No. Let's go eat something
near your home.

552
00:30:27,070 --> 00:30:27,740
I'll take ya.

553
00:30:27,740 --> 00:30:29,690
Huh? Why do you have to take me?

554
00:30:29,690 --> 00:30:31,690
You have to go back and forth,
wasting time.

555
00:30:32,420 --> 00:30:34,090
You'll be tired.

556
00:30:34,840 --> 00:30:36,570
Then...

557
00:30:36,570 --> 00:30:38,140
You'll sleep over at my dorm.

558
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:41,020
Hm?
No I cannot.

559
00:30:41,020 --> 00:30:43,750
I've been at your dorm so many nights already.

560
00:30:43,750 --> 00:30:44,980
I was also there last night.

561
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:47,400
My mom's gonna forget my face already.

562
00:30:47,780 --> 00:30:49,850
It's okay.

563
00:30:49,850 --> 00:30:51,310
You can sleep at my dorm every night.

564
00:30:51,310 --> 00:30:52,490
You mom said so.

565
00:30:53,620 --> 00:30:55,100
We can also sleep in a little.

566
00:30:57,160 --> 00:30:58,520
You don't have to worry about that.

567
00:30:58,520 --> 00:31:00,520
I never wake up late.

568
00:31:03,350 --> 00:31:05,100
Just sleep at my dorm.

569
00:31:05,100 --> 00:31:06,790
Who's gonna wake me up,
if you don't?

570
00:31:06,790 --> 00:31:09,040
Didn't you wake up by yourself
when you were in America?

571
00:31:10,890 --> 00:31:12,430
I've got you now.

572
00:31:13,910 --> 00:31:15,620
I will wake up late for sure.

573
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:20,660
Fine fine fine.

574
00:31:20,660 --> 00:31:23,640
I'll call mom and let her know
I'll be at your dorm tonight.

575
00:31:23,640 --> 00:31:24,570
Okay?

576
00:31:25,240 --> 00:31:26,760
You're the best!

577
00:31:27,720 --> 00:31:28,020
Let's go.

578
00:31:28,020 --> 00:31:29,030
You're acting like a child.

579
00:31:33,400 --> 00:31:34,520
That's all we want.

580
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:35,590
Sure.
Please wait a moment.

581
00:31:35,590 --> 00:31:36,290
Yes.

582
00:31:37,110 --> 00:31:38,860
How's your day?
Did you have fun?

583
00:31:38,860 --> 00:31:40,950
Hey Eiw!

584
00:31:40,950 --> 00:31:41,950
Hi.

585
00:31:41,950 --> 00:31:43,750
- Hi Ohm and Tae.
- Hey.

586
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:46,000
Haven't seen you for so long.

587
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:47,310
Rarely see you at the faculty.

588
00:31:47,310 --> 00:31:48,870
Tal's been missing you.

589
00:31:48,870 --> 00:31:51,060
I've been busy myself.

590
00:31:51,060 --> 00:31:53,060
But after this, I'll go in everyday.

591
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:55,780
Oh for the university play right?

592
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,710
So you agreed to be in the play?

593
00:31:57,710 --> 00:31:58,800
Yes I did.

594
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:01,690
Good. Everyone wants to see you.

595
00:32:02,450 --> 00:32:03,010
Really?

596
00:32:03,010 --> 00:32:03,930
Yeah.

597
00:32:03,930 --> 00:32:06,170
This is Cake.
He's a friend of mine.

598
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:07,690
He's from international program.

599
00:32:07,690 --> 00:32:10,130
Not sure you guys've seen him before.

600
00:32:10,130 --> 00:32:11,230
Hello.

601
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,820
Oh Cake.

602
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:18,460
Nobody doesn't know him.

603
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,930
The girls are talking about him a lot.

604
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:23,600
I don't know how to react to that.

605
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:25,170
You could be used to it already.

606
00:32:25,170 --> 00:32:26,580
Used to it already.

607
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:28,580
I'll go eat now.

608
00:32:28,580 --> 00:32:29,480
See you around.

609
00:32:29,480 --> 00:32:30,130
See you.

610
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:31,870
-See you.
- Bye bye.

611
00:32:31,870 --> 00:32:32,310
Let's go.

612
00:32:34,890 --> 00:32:37,640
You're known by lots of people nowadays.

613
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:41,040
But I'm not as popular as
the king's faculty for sure.

614
00:32:41,490 --> 00:32:42,700
Don't you dare mock me back.

615
00:32:42,700 --> 00:32:43,690
It's true!

616
00:32:43,690 --> 00:32:46,490
Wherever you go,
everyone knows you.

617
00:32:46,490 --> 00:32:48,810
What should I call you then?

618
00:32:49,220 --> 00:32:50,560
Cake, the king...

619
00:32:50,560 --> 00:32:52,010
Stop it Cake!
You can't do that.

620
00:32:52,010 --> 00:32:53,350
You are so nasty.

621
00:32:54,070 --> 00:32:55,800
Playing like a kid.

622
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:56,650
Or you want the sauce?

623
00:32:57,110 --> 00:32:57,770
Cake.

624
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:02,340
The food is here.

625
00:33:03,820 --> 00:33:05,320
This place is really good.

626
00:33:05,320 --> 00:33:06,680
You try it.

627
00:33:07,410 --> 00:33:09,650
Oh! Tomorrow after school,

628
00:33:09,650 --> 00:33:11,650
I'll be the model for Tal to take pictures.

629
00:33:14,460 --> 00:33:15,920
For what?

630
00:33:15,920 --> 00:33:17,450
It's a freestyle project.

631
00:33:18,180 --> 00:33:19,450
He asked me long time ago.

632
00:33:23,950 --> 00:33:26,260
Why do you have to always help this guy?

633
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:30,090
He's the senior from drama club
in high school remember?

634
00:33:30,090 --> 00:33:32,500
He helped me with so many things.

635
00:33:32,500 --> 00:33:35,410
He gave me suggestions
and taught me many things.

636
00:33:35,410 --> 00:33:37,730
I know a lot of people, also because of him.

637
00:33:38,290 --> 00:33:40,440
He's a good guy Cake.

638
00:33:44,290 --> 00:33:46,710
Where is this going to take place?

639
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:47,910
Is it gonna be long?

640
00:33:49,390 --> 00:33:51,170
I think it's the coffee shop of his friend.

641
00:33:51,170 --> 00:33:53,170
Not so far from the campus.

642
00:33:53,170 --> 00:33:55,570
It should take around 2-3 hours.

643
00:33:56,730 --> 00:33:58,860
I will go with you then.

644
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,700
You wanna come with me?

645
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:04,050
Are you gonna be bored?

646
00:34:04,050 --> 00:34:06,040
No I won't.
I will wait.

647
00:34:08,540 --> 00:34:10,320
Ok then.

648
00:34:11,139 --> 00:34:12,230
Let's eat.

649
00:34:12,989 --> 00:34:14,420
You should eat too,

650
00:34:14,810 --> 00:34:15,760
before telling others.

651
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:17,520
I wanna know
whether you think it's good.

652
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:19,170
- I'm waiting.
- Just eat up.

653
00:34:19,170 --> 00:34:20,570
I really wanna know.

654
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,159
Hi Tal.

655
00:34:31,159 --> 00:34:32,600
Hey Eiw.

656
00:34:32,870 --> 00:34:34,880
Why're you here so early today?

657
00:34:34,880 --> 00:34:36,880
I don't wanna be late,
so I hurried here.

658
00:34:37,949 --> 00:34:40,199
This is the owner of this shop.

659
00:34:40,690 --> 00:34:41,960
Hello Ben.

660
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:42,909
I'm See-Eiw.

661
00:34:43,540 --> 00:34:45,219
I've heard a lot about you from Tal.

662
00:34:45,219 --> 00:34:46,520
Finally get to meet in person.

663
00:34:46,520 --> 00:34:47,420
Really?

664
00:34:48,500 --> 00:34:50,400
I wonder what have you heard about me?

665
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:52,620
- Oh.
- Hello.

666
00:34:52,620 --> 00:34:54,210
This is Cake.

667
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:55,330
He's accompanying me today.

668
00:34:55,460 --> 00:34:57,330
Are you ok with him staying?

669
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:59,330
Sure no problem.

670
00:34:59,730 --> 00:35:02,270
What do you guys wanna drink?

671
00:35:02,270 --> 00:35:03,230
There're snacks also.

672
00:35:03,880 --> 00:35:05,630
I'll go check out the snacks.

673
00:35:05,630 --> 00:35:07,490
Um I'll go prepare the camera then.

674
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:09,100
Order whatever you'd like.
On me.

675
00:35:09,370 --> 00:35:11,170
That's okay.
You're too kind.

676
00:35:13,270 --> 00:35:15,910
Don't be like this with me.

677
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:18,170
Ok. I'll buy my own next time.

678
00:35:18,170 --> 00:35:19,890
I really want to help you out.

679
00:35:20,820 --> 00:35:23,500
You help me out and don't get paid.

680
00:35:24,780 --> 00:35:27,390
Just let me buy you the drinks.

681
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:29,930
Fine.

682
00:35:29,930 --> 00:35:31,140
Cake too.

683
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:34,590
It's okay. I'm not helping with anything.

684
00:35:35,050 --> 00:35:37,060
Just order. Don't be shy.

685
00:35:38,390 --> 00:35:39,340
It's fine. Really.

686
00:35:43,520 --> 00:35:45,290
Ok. I'll go set up the camera then.

687
00:35:45,290 --> 00:35:48,120
Sure. I'll order and follow you in a bit.

688
00:35:49,670 --> 00:35:50,350
Let's order.

689
00:35:50,350 --> 00:35:52,350
Any recommendations?

690
00:35:52,350 --> 00:35:54,650
I'd suggest you to try the cake...

691
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:57,930
devil food cake.

692
00:35:57,930 --> 00:35:59,930
Our signature.

693
00:36:00,930 --> 00:36:02,690
Ok.

694
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,010
Ready?

695
00:36:05,490 --> 00:36:07,000
Ok.

696
00:36:07,430 --> 00:36:08,360
That's great Eiw.

697
00:36:08,360 --> 00:36:09,440
Smile a little.

698
00:36:09,440 --> 00:36:10,980
Can I try...

699
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:13,160
maybe turn your face to the right a little.

700
00:36:13,160 --> 00:36:15,380
Right Eiw. This side.

701
00:36:16,010 --> 00:36:17,250
Ok.

702
00:36:17,250 --> 00:36:19,200
The table's gonna be fine right?

703
00:36:20,520 --> 00:36:21,200
Ready?

704
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:21,650
Yes!

705
00:36:23,120 --> 00:36:24,200
That's cute.

706
00:36:25,810 --> 00:36:27,820
That's great. Good. Like that.

707
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,390
That's good.

708
00:36:32,790 --> 00:36:34,510
You're going good.

709
00:36:41,590 --> 00:36:43,060
The hair is in the way...

710
00:36:43,060 --> 00:36:43,910
Oh really?

711
00:36:43,910 --> 00:36:44,860
Can I adjust it a bit?

712
00:36:45,660 --> 00:36:46,930
That's fine.

713
00:36:46,930 --> 00:36:47,850
I'll help you with that.

714
00:36:47,850 --> 00:36:49,240
You can have the camera ready.

715
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:54,100
It's messy?

716
00:36:57,510 --> 00:36:58,640
I'll adjust it for ya.

717
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:02,250
How're you doing?
Tired yet?

718
00:37:02,250 --> 00:37:04,420
Not at all. It's fun.

719
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:20,440
I didn't know how to act
my face back then.

720
00:37:21,370 --> 00:37:23,640
Yeah. You're so good with it now.

721
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:28,660
Ow. That hurts.

722
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,170
Since when do you like being a model?

723
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:34,840
You used to run away from the camera.

724
00:37:35,460 --> 00:37:37,240
Cake.

725
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:41,950
Let's go home.

726
00:37:45,390 --> 00:37:47,770
Thank you so much for today, Eiw.

727
00:37:47,770 --> 00:37:50,100
That's totally fine.
It's not a big deal.

728
00:37:50,100 --> 00:37:52,260
Just let me know anytime,
if you need help.

729
00:37:54,530 --> 00:37:56,530
You said it yourself.

730
00:37:57,390 --> 00:37:59,570
Sure.

731
00:37:59,570 --> 00:38:01,860
I'm gonna go now.

732
00:38:01,860 --> 00:38:03,860
Get home safely.

733
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:05,440
Let's go home Cake.

734
00:38:05,440 --> 00:38:06,950
See you, Cake.

735
00:38:11,260 --> 00:38:12,280
Let's go.

736
00:38:12,280 --> 00:38:14,060
Ugh I'm starving.

737
00:38:19,860 --> 00:38:22,680
I'm super hungry.
What do you wanna have?

738
00:38:22,680 --> 00:38:25,660
- I asked you first.
- My stomach is crying.

739
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:30,920
Do you this it's what I think?

740
00:38:30,920 --> 00:38:33,240
Don't ask me.

741
00:38:34,720 --> 00:38:38,780
Should I prepare you a shoulder to cry on.

742
00:38:56,920 --> 00:38:58,810
Let's go.

743
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:29,500
Why are you smiling, Cake?

744
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:32,350
Huh?

745
00:39:32,350 --> 00:39:34,130
Why are you smiling!?

746
00:39:34,130 --> 00:39:35,880
Nothing.

747
00:39:35,880 --> 00:39:38,570
It's just that you've improved
with the bus.

748
00:39:40,130 --> 00:39:41,860
Are you mocking me?

749
00:39:43,130 --> 00:39:45,570
No...I just...

750
00:39:45,570 --> 00:39:48,150
miss the old days
where you couldn't balance

751
00:39:48,150 --> 00:39:50,150
and needed to lean on me.

752
00:39:51,790 --> 00:39:53,770
I've grown.

753
00:39:53,770 --> 00:39:55,770
I can just stand
without holding the hand rail.

754
00:39:56,240 --> 00:39:57,860
Show me.

755
00:40:02,060 --> 00:40:04,010
You could fall!

756
00:40:04,010 --> 00:40:06,930
Haven't been on for so long.

757
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:10,100
I can let go of the hand rail.
So chill.

758
00:40:25,410 --> 00:40:26,860
Evening mom.

759
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:28,860
Oh hi.

760
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,640
Good evening aunty Proud.

761
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:34,240
Hi. How're you doing?

762
00:40:34,240 --> 00:40:35,010
I'm good.

763
00:40:35,880 --> 00:40:38,060
Are you sleeping over tonight?

764
00:40:38,060 --> 00:40:40,330
Yes and I already told my family.

765
00:40:40,330 --> 00:40:41,750
That's good.

766
00:40:44,100 --> 00:40:47,240
Go wash your hands first.
It's full of germs.

767
00:40:47,240 --> 00:40:49,700
Fine. I'll go wash.

768
00:40:49,700 --> 00:40:52,970
I'll take Eiw to shower too.

769
00:40:52,970 --> 00:40:54,240
Ok...then...

770
00:40:59,500 --> 00:41:01,370
That's good stuff.

771
00:41:04,190 --> 00:41:06,660
So is this the one who did it, Eiw?

772
00:41:06,660 --> 00:41:08,530
I don't know.
Haven't found out yet.

773
00:41:08,530 --> 00:41:10,210
This is the climax.

774
00:41:10,210 --> 00:41:12,970
The main character is about to tell.

775
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,350
Is the friend really genuine?

776
00:41:16,350 --> 00:41:18,880
He looks sketchy.

777
00:41:20,460 --> 00:41:22,550
Ask too many questions
probably don't have to watch anymore.

778
00:41:23,860 --> 00:41:26,930
Back off.
You've already seen it.

779
00:41:26,930 --> 00:41:28,390
I have.

780
00:41:28,390 --> 00:41:30,680
But I wanna watch it again quietly.

781
00:41:30,680 --> 00:41:31,660
Quietly!

782
00:41:31,660 --> 00:41:33,170
Then go watch it alone.

783
00:41:33,350 --> 00:41:36,790
- Go go go go go.
- Shhhh.

784
00:41:36,790 --> 00:41:38,790
Shhhhh.

785
00:41:38,790 --> 00:41:42,190
Look at that, Eiw!

786
00:41:43,130 --> 00:41:44,480
I think this is the bad guy.

787
00:41:44,480 --> 00:41:47,080
- Look at his face.
- I'll kick you out back to your room,

788
00:41:47,080 --> 00:41:48,460
if you don't stop asking

789
00:41:48,460 --> 00:41:49,480
Why why why?

790
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,480
- I can't concentrate.
- That's enough.

791
00:41:51,480 --> 00:41:53,480
You guys are the same.
Fighting til today.

792
00:41:53,480 --> 00:41:55,660
I think that's it.
I can tell from his face.

793
00:41:55,660 --> 00:41:57,010
- I can't concentrate!

794
00:41:57,010 --> 00:42:01,440
- You should go back to your room.
-Why? No I'm not going to my room. I'll watch here.

795
00:42:01,440 --> 00:42:04,860
- No. I'll watch here.!
- You're asking too much.
- Ugh that's enough.

796
00:42:06,590 --> 00:42:08,150
Stop it.

797
00:42:17,790 --> 00:42:19,500
Who are you talking to?

798
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:22,300
Don't mind other people's business.

799
00:42:23,300 --> 00:42:25,130
Who's the guy?

800
00:42:25,130 --> 00:42:25,990
What?

801
00:42:25,990 --> 00:42:27,990
I'll tell mom.

802
00:42:27,990 --> 00:42:29,500
I'm a grown up now.

803
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:33,150
- Even you dated since you were in junior high.
- See! Still arguing?

804
00:42:34,410 --> 00:42:36,120
I don't wanna tell, but

805
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,950
-Cream!
- When you were in America,

806
00:42:37,950 --> 00:42:39,240
He was a player.

807
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,040
He changed the girl he talked to every week.

808
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:42,640
With Ella...

809
00:42:42,640 --> 00:42:45,240
-Cream!
-I saw it that she...

810
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:47,720
-Stop it!
-Kissed Cake on the cheek.

811
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:48,950
She's just a friend

812
00:42:48,950 --> 00:42:51,640
What friend?

813
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,920
Let me see your phone.

814
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,460
Who's the guy?

815
00:42:57,460 --> 00:42:59,240
Let me see.

816
00:43:00,520 --> 00:43:02,440
No!

817
00:43:02,440 --> 00:43:04,610
Woooooo there's a guy.

818
00:43:04,610 --> 00:43:07,240
-Mom! Mom!
-Give me back Cake!

819
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,290
Cream is talking to a guy.

820
00:43:09,290 --> 00:43:10,210
Give it back!

821
00:43:10,210 --> 00:43:12,350
She's talking to a guy.

822
00:43:39,960 --> 00:43:41,470
Eiw.

823
00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:46,200
What's up Cake?

824
00:44:00,290 --> 00:44:02,980
Well...

825
00:44:02,980 --> 00:44:06,090
I didn't have any girlfriends

826
00:44:06,090 --> 00:44:08,290
when I was in America.

827
00:44:09,290 --> 00:44:11,940
Cream was full of crap.

828
00:44:13,050 --> 00:44:15,340
About Ella's kissing my cheek,

829
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:18,140
it's...

830
00:44:18,140 --> 00:44:21,600
that way people saying hi
and good bye that way.

831
00:44:25,690 --> 00:44:27,470
It's okay, Cake.

832
00:44:28,600 --> 00:44:32,180
You don't have to explain to me.

833
00:44:34,340 --> 00:44:36,490
I want to tell you...

834
00:44:37,960 --> 00:44:40,450
...want to tell you everything.

835
00:44:43,340 --> 00:44:45,710
So...

836
00:44:47,140 --> 00:44:50,430
If anything happens,
can you tell me everything too?

837
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:54,430
Sure.

838
00:44:54,430 --> 00:44:57,450
But right not, we need to sleep.

839
00:44:58,160 --> 00:44:59,940
If you don't wanna wake up late.

840
00:45:01,940 --> 00:45:03,400
Good night.

841
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,400
Good night, Cake.

842
00:46:19,550 --> 00:46:22,690
Has Tal been flirting with you?

843
00:46:22,690 --> 00:46:24,950
When we were in the club,

844
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:27,350
I always go back home with Tal.

845
00:46:27,350 --> 00:46:29,210
You guys are all grown up.

846
00:46:29,210 --> 00:46:31,210
You can't stick together all the time anymore.

847
00:46:31,210 --> 00:46:33,520
Am I still important to you?

848
00:46:33,520 --> 00:46:35,750
You seem to be doing fine without me.

849
00:46:35,750 --> 00:46:38,490
I do all these, isn't it because of you?

850
00:46:38,490 --> 00:46:40,490
You're the one who's changed.

851
00:46:40,490 --> 00:46:42,660
With Tal, I'm not stubborn anymore.
