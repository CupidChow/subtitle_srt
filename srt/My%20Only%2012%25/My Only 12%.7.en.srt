1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
"Mama's Dim Sum"

2
00:00:39,380 --> 00:00:41,380
So you're not gonna
say anything to me?

3
00:00:43,750 --> 00:00:45,660
I don't know
what to talk about.

4
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:47,220
I'm angry.

5
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:48,660
I'm also angry.

6
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:50,380
Why? Is there anything
you're angry about?

7
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:53,420
- Why did you have to get in a fight?
- You're really asking me this?

8
00:00:53,420 --> 00:00:55,420
Why did you have to
fight and punch Sand?

9
00:00:55,420 --> 00:00:57,420
and why did I have to do it?

10
00:00:59,810 --> 00:01:01,720
I didn't want you
to fight with Sand.

11
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:04,080
So you're upset because I punched him?

12
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:05,560
No.

13
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:06,520
No what?

14
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:09,600
Because you never know anything!

15
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:12,970
Is that right?

16
00:01:12,970 --> 00:01:14,630
Then what do you
want me to do?

17
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:17,450
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry, okay!?

18
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,010
Am I still important to you?

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,430
You are.
How dare you ask me that?

20
00:01:22,430 --> 00:01:24,430
Then why didn't you tell me
when things happen.

21
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:29,180
I'm always here.

22
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:31,600
You didn't even
try to talk to me.

23
00:01:32,780 --> 00:01:35,539
- Is it true?
- And were you there for me to talk?

24
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,700
Don't you dare ask me back.

25
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:43,580
Huh?

26
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,420
Huh?

27
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:49,520
So if I've got something goin' on,
I don't have to tell you right?

28
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:51,520
Yeah. I'm sorry.

29
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:02,150
I'm sorry.
I didn't meant to yell.

30
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:03,760
You never listened to me.

31
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,760
You kept yelling
to me non-stop.

32
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,050
- You kept nagging me.
- I didn't me to.

33
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:15,050
I'm sorry.

34
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:17,050
I'm sorry.

35
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:40,720
I'm sorry I yelled at you.

36
00:02:43,579 --> 00:02:45,070
I'm sorry too.

37
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,070
That you're hurt
because of me.

38
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:51,500
It's okay.

39
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:53,500
He's more hurt than me.

40
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:57,780
Look it's only a little.

41
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,990
Did aunty Proud punish you?

42
00:03:06,730 --> 00:03:07,570
Forget it.

43
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:09,570
No I can't.

44
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:13,160
Did you get punished?

45
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:16,829
I don't know.
I don't remember.

46
00:03:16,829 --> 00:03:18,829
How many?

47
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:21,590
Tell me how many times?

48
00:03:23,890 --> 00:03:25,720
Well...more than a few.

49
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:28,660
Why did she still punish you?

50
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:31,520
I told her to punish me instead.
All on me.

51
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,010
Why did she punish you?

52
00:03:33,010 --> 00:03:35,010
How can you
be punished for me?

53
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:37,820
It's not your fault.

54
00:03:37,820 --> 00:03:40,510
I'm hot headed myself.
I deserve to be punished.

55
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:43,350
That's not okay, Cake.
How can you deserve it?

56
00:03:43,350 --> 00:03:46,010
How is it not my fault?
It's all my fault.

57
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:48,970
All of it happened
because of me, wasn't it?

58
00:03:48,970 --> 00:03:51,360
Why did you get punished still?

59
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:52,840
She could've punished me
half of what you got.

60
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:54,630
or even all of it.

61
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:56,630
I will punish you myself,

62
00:03:56,630 --> 00:03:58,630
if you do not behave, hm?

63
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,400
How could you lend people
money easily?

64
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:03,400
I'm mad about that, you know?

65
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:06,500
He told me he was in trouble.

66
00:04:07,090 --> 00:04:10,000
You can't
even if he was in trouble.

67
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:13,560
You can't give out money easily.
It took forever to save that.

68
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,209
Even I asked you for money,
you can't give it to me.

69
00:04:18,890 --> 00:04:22,019
If you asked,
I can always give you.

70
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,940
I would never ask you for the money.

71
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:27,560
I mean everything.

72
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:29,560
I can give you everything.

73
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:35,909
Me too.

74
00:04:35,909 --> 00:04:37,909
I can give you anything.

75
00:04:38,950 --> 00:04:41,720
But please don't
make me worry again, okay?

76
00:04:42,790 --> 00:04:45,150
Let's talk when something happens
like we used to.

77
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:48,409
Promise?

78
00:04:48,750 --> 00:04:50,810
Ok I promise.

79
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:02,200
I need to apologize to you too,

80
00:05:02,200 --> 00:05:03,840
that I'm the reason you're hurt.

81
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,900
Are you hurt?

82
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:12,150
Then we are even okay?

83
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:15,530
Even? It's not worth it Cake.

84
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:17,530
It's okay.
I'm not hurt anymore.

85
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:23,510
You're sad like a dog.
Here come hug me.

86
00:05:23,510 --> 00:05:25,510
Let's hug.

87
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:34,040
Don't hold me.

88
00:05:34,580 --> 00:05:37,409
- Smell my armpit.
- You were comforting me just now.
Why're you teasing me?

89
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,780
- Is it hurt here?
- Um.

90
00:06:39,780 --> 00:06:41,140
How about here?

91
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,140
It's not red.
How can you're hurt?

92
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:46,690
- Ow.
- You're overreacting.
I haven't touched you.

93
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:49,909
- Bla bla bla.
- Don't mock me.

94
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:52,760
Cake and what is it that
you wanted to talk this morning?

95
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:57,270
- Even after everything, you still remember?
-Of course I remember.

96
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:59,270
So what did you mom say?

97
00:06:59,460 --> 00:07:01,270
Is something wrong?

98
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,620
We talked a lot already for today.

99
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:06,410
- Let's discuss tomorrow.
- Hey!

100
00:07:06,410 --> 00:07:08,410
You said we're gonna tell each other things.

101
00:07:10,210 --> 00:07:11,980
I'm tired.

102
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:13,980
We can still talk tomorrow.

103
00:07:14,270 --> 00:07:17,030
- But you always disappear.
- No 'but'.

104
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:19,030
Go take a shower.

105
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,780
Go.

106
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:22,780
Go take a shower first.
Go.

107
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,780
Fine.
- Come on. Go.

108
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,110
You have to tell me
once I'm back.

109
00:07:29,330 --> 00:07:31,560
Tomorrow is tomorrow.

110
00:07:32,690 --> 00:07:34,450
Today!

111
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,840
Oh I will stop by to get
some cotton pads for a min.

112
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,180
I ran out at home.

113
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:49,360
Um I'll wait outside then.

114
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:51,200
Want anything?

115
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,790
- Just a small bottle of water.
- Sure. I'll be back in a bit.

116
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:57,970
Have you heard about Samai's daughter?

117
00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,920
Yeah. I heard.
The whole market knows about this.

118
00:09:00,920 --> 00:09:02,920
She works in such a big role.

119
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:04,420
Why is she dating a college kid?

120
00:09:04,420 --> 00:09:07,450
I saw them dropping each other off
the other day.

121
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,870
Kinda inappropriate,
don't you think?

122
00:09:08,870 --> 00:09:10,870
She's a grown woman,
but still dates a kid.

123
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:13,830
The kid is almost 10 years
younger than her.

124
00:09:13,830 --> 00:09:16,780
Yeah.
He hasn't even finished his bachelor.

125
00:09:17,730 --> 00:09:20,390
He hasn't even finished his bachelor.

126
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:23,310
I really wonder whether his mother
talks to him about this?

127
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,310
Yeah right?

128
00:09:25,310 --> 00:09:28,310
Actually, I also wanna know
when they walk side-by-side,

129
00:09:28,310 --> 00:09:31,170
is she ashamed?
People might think the kid is her son.

130
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:34,810
I don't think she is. She wouldn't walk around
for people to see, if she is.

131
00:09:34,810 --> 00:09:37,220
Let's buy these pens,
my kids need it for their class.

132
00:09:37,590 --> 00:09:40,620
- Their shoes are worn out. I'll just take this one.
- Sure.

133
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:55,980
So what's gonna happen
with Sand?

134
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:57,980
Nothing much.

135
00:09:57,980 --> 00:10:00,390
He said he's gonna pay back.
That's all.

136
00:10:04,100 --> 00:10:06,260
What about you?

137
00:10:06,260 --> 00:10:08,140
You haven't come
to my home for a week.

138
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,140
How come
you wanna come today?

139
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:12,140
It's nothing.

140
00:10:12,140 --> 00:10:14,140
Nothing huh?

141
00:10:15,180 --> 00:10:16,300
- Eiw.
- Hm?

142
00:10:16,300 --> 00:10:18,800
Peak and I'll go hang
and eat at your place today.

143
00:10:19,310 --> 00:10:20,380
Why?

144
00:10:20,380 --> 00:10:22,380
Please.

145
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,070
Um.

146
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,150
A little too big of a yawn?

147
00:10:54,410 --> 00:10:56,220
Do you wanna go shower?

148
00:10:56,810 --> 00:10:59,240
What about you guys?

149
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,820
He will go home soon.

150
00:11:02,820 --> 00:11:04,820
You can go ahead...shower first.

151
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:10,560
What are you looking at?

152
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:20,240
- Cake.
- Hm?

153
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,010
I'm not sure whether my sister
will be back home today.

154
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,780
Just let him wait for a bit.

155
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:40,710
I'm gonna go shower.

156
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:43,150
- I will let you know when I'm done.
- I'm out.

157
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:46,820
You want another wound?

158
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,600
I just arrived.
I'll check for you now.

159
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,930
Ok you.
Ok.

160
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,290
Hey!

161
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,620
You scared me.

162
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,980
You're hanging out here today?

163
00:12:12,220 --> 00:12:14,220
And...

164
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,110
Where are Cake and Eiw?

165
00:12:16,110 --> 00:12:18,110
They went to shower.

166
00:12:18,460 --> 00:12:21,150
- Oh.
- Are you still reading your script?

167
00:12:21,150 --> 00:12:21,830
Um.

168
00:12:21,830 --> 00:12:24,050
- You want me to help you rehearse?
- Hey that's okay.

169
00:12:24,050 --> 00:12:26,050
Let me help.

170
00:12:39,930 --> 00:12:43,360
Is this the same script
you rehearse on the stage that day?

171
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:45,240
Oh yes.

172
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:47,060
Important scene.

173
00:12:47,060 --> 00:12:49,060
I'm kinda adjusting to it.

174
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:54,150
Shall we start?

175
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:08,130
Yon don't really know...

176
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,130
how I feel?

177
00:13:13,100 --> 00:13:15,980
You've never said anything.

178
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,980
How am I supposed to know?

179
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:26,650
From my action.

180
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:29,210
my eye-contact.

181
00:13:29,700 --> 00:13:31,610
You don't now...really?

182
00:13:33,420 --> 00:13:36,040
And If I knew, what am I supposed to do?

183
00:13:37,170 --> 00:13:40,430
How do I know what I guess is correct?

184
00:13:43,710 --> 00:13:45,700
- What if today I want...
- Enough.

185
00:13:49,210 --> 00:13:53,130
- Listen to me.-
- You had all those time, why didn't you say something.

186
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:56,740
What were you doing?

187
00:14:00,080 --> 00:14:03,170
Why do you have to tell me
when it's too late?

188
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:07,760
Why do you tell me now
when I'm not waiting to hear anymore.

189
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:18,220
I'm sorry.

190
00:14:40,900 --> 00:14:43,210
That's enough.
I made my mind.

191
00:14:45,460 --> 00:14:47,820
I'm sorry I didn't say anything earlier.

192
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,570
But I really do feel...

193
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:53,500
until I can't leave it like this anymore.

194
00:15:21,210 --> 00:15:24,010
Hey wrong lines.

195
00:15:25,260 --> 00:15:27,330
No it's not.

196
00:15:37,170 --> 00:15:39,620
I'm tired.
That should be enough for today.

197
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:13,270
That's all I have for now.

198
00:16:13,810 --> 00:16:15,270
You take this first.

199
00:16:22,780 --> 00:16:25,740
I know this doesn't help,

200
00:16:25,740 --> 00:16:27,740
but I'm sorry.

201
00:16:31,390 --> 00:16:33,330
I'm really sorry.

202
00:16:34,640 --> 00:16:36,830
I didn't know that you were upset...

203
00:16:36,830 --> 00:16:38,830
about me telling stories about my mother.

204
00:16:40,940 --> 00:16:42,820
Forget it.

205
00:16:48,660 --> 00:16:50,470
I'm sorry...really.

206
00:16:52,330 --> 00:16:55,180
I didn't think through
how would you feel.

207
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,480
To be honest,

208
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:02,350
I don't live with my father either.

209
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:07,130
It felt really good...

210
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:11,260
every time you tell me stories
about your father.

211
00:17:14,470 --> 00:17:16,450
That's why I thought...

212
00:17:16,450 --> 00:17:18,450
If I bring you home...

213
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:21,119
to meet my mom...

214
00:17:21,119 --> 00:17:23,119
...to eat food that she makes,

215
00:17:24,170 --> 00:17:26,740
might make you feel good in the same way I did.

216
00:17:30,560 --> 00:17:32,950
But I might be wrong,
I'm sorry.

217
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,780
Well...

218
00:17:45,050 --> 00:17:47,110
I'm gonna go.

219
00:17:48,890 --> 00:17:50,080
Eiw.

220
00:17:59,680 --> 00:18:01,550
I'm sorry.

221
00:18:17,290 --> 00:18:18,800
I don't really know...

222
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:23,580
what do you want from me
when you came to say hi that that day.

223
00:18:25,680 --> 00:18:27,870
You might want to trick me
to buy you things.

224
00:18:28,920 --> 00:18:30,770
or perhaps money.

225
00:18:33,460 --> 00:18:36,680
But I do have something
I want from you too.

226
00:18:42,820 --> 00:18:44,410
For me,

227
00:18:46,790 --> 00:18:48,640
It's not stuff.

228
00:18:49,670 --> 00:18:51,630
And it's not about money either.

229
00:18:55,950 --> 00:18:57,990
I just want a friend.

230
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:02,580
So...

231
00:19:03,820 --> 00:19:06,280
when I lent you the money,

232
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,880
I just hope we could really be friends.

233
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:19,870
That's all.

234
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:25,550
But you can't be that. I get it.

235
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:31,200
Anyways...thank you.

236
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:33,200
For coming to say hi to me that day,

237
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,260
for taking me to do many fun things.

238
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:44,280
I really had good times with you.

239
00:19:48,200 --> 00:19:49,790
I'm going now.

240
00:19:50,920 --> 00:19:52,840
Good luck, Sand.

241
00:19:53,970 --> 00:19:55,410
Eiw.

242
00:20:00,950 --> 00:20:02,970
I'm so sorry.

243
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,480
Good luck, Sand.

244
00:20:23,950 --> 00:20:25,540
I'm here.

245
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,460
Why so late?

246
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,780
I talked to him a little.

247
00:20:33,780 --> 00:20:35,500
What were you guys talking about?

248
00:20:36,290 --> 00:20:37,950
He apologized to you.

249
00:20:40,520 --> 00:20:42,020
I don't accept it.

250
00:20:43,830 --> 00:20:45,520
But I did.

251
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:49,880
Eiw!

252
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:51,880
Why not?

253
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:54,670
Just accepting. It’s not a big deal.

254
00:20:54,670 --> 00:20:57,770
I forgave him,
so we don’t owe each other anything.

255
00:21:02,420 --> 00:21:04,320
That’s good.

256
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:06,320
So we all come to term at last.

257
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,560
Cake.

258
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:12,980
Your face looks like a giant beast.

259
00:21:13,700 --> 00:21:15,790
Stop laughing!

260
00:21:15,790 --> 00:21:17,790
Okay. Okay.

261
00:21:20,310 --> 00:21:22,110
Where are you going next?

262
00:21:22,110 --> 00:21:23,610
Are you goin' to see Rin?

263
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:25,610
I’m going to see Kung.

264
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:29,000
Today...

265
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,040
I’m not going to see her actually.
I will go straight home with you.

266
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,600
Why?

267
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:35,600
You don’t have to comfort me.

268
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:37,730
I’m fine now.
Don’t worry.

269
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:39,730
I’m also no longer stressed.

270
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:42,980
Nothing.

271
00:21:42,980 --> 00:21:45,430
I just wanna go home.

272
00:21:48,850 --> 00:21:51,320
Actually…

273
00:21:51,320 --> 00:21:53,320
we haven’t really gone to
the canal area for awhile.

274
00:21:54,210 --> 00:21:55,810
Are you going there?

275
00:21:56,740 --> 00:21:59,180
- Do you wanna go?
- For real?

276
00:21:59,530 --> 00:22:01,180
- Yeah.
- I would love to go!

277
00:22:01,930 --> 00:22:03,590
- Then let’s go, shall we?
- Um!

278
00:22:04,430 --> 00:22:06,040
Let’a go.

279
00:22:08,800 --> 00:22:10,610
Come on, Cake!

280
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:29,260
Hey...

281
00:22:30,610 --> 00:22:32,010
Cake.

282
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:34,630
Why is mine not skipping like yours?

283
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:36,370
How can it be?

284
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:38,370
You threw it so hard like that.

285
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:40,370
Here.
You can’t throw it like that.

286
00:22:40,370 --> 00:22:42,800
- Aha.
- You have to throw it straight.

287
00:22:45,810 --> 00:22:46,940
Hey!

288
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:48,940
Isn’t that cool?

289
00:22:50,770 --> 00:22:53,640
Ugh why does it look
so difficult?

290
00:22:54,460 --> 00:22:56,700
Difficult?
No it’s not.

291
00:22:56,700 --> 00:22:58,700
Here let me teach you.

292
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,080
You just…

293
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:02,290
need to choose
a flat rock like this one, see?

294
00:23:02,290 --> 00:23:04,460
- Um.
- And then stand side way like this.

295
00:23:04,460 --> 00:23:07,270
- Aha.
-  Then just throw it straight.

296
00:23:08,950 --> 00:23:10,570
See?

297
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,900
- You try it.
- That’s cool.

298
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:14,900
I will teach you.

299
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:16,900
Like this.

300
00:23:17,800 --> 00:23:20,270
- That kind of rock wouldn’t do it.
- Oh.

301
00:23:20,270 --> 00:23:22,270
Pick a new rock.

302
00:23:24,270 --> 00:23:26,110
- Flat one.
- Aha.

303
00:23:27,830 --> 00:23:30,480
- And stand on the side way.
- Stand side way.

304
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,480
And then throw.

305
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:36,040
Hey it’s skipping now.

306
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:38,040
- Did you see that Cake?
- Yeah. I saw it.

307
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,750
- It skipped so many times also.
-Um.

308
00:23:39,750 --> 00:23:41,750
I did it.

309
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:47,710
Do you wanna try again?

310
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:52,740
Watch me!
Next time…

311
00:23:52,740 --> 00:23:55,090
I will make it skip more
just like you did.

312
00:23:58,660 --> 00:24:02,030
Sure Mr.smart pants!

313
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:14,100
- Eiw.
- Hm?

314
00:24:18,260 --> 00:24:19,840
What’s up Cake?

315
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,740
Nothing.

316
00:24:27,740 --> 00:24:29,740
I just wanna ask you…

317
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:32,340
are you hungry?

318
00:24:32,340 --> 00:24:34,340
Do you wanna go home?

319
00:24:36,560 --> 00:24:39,380
Sure, we can go home.
It’s getting dark also.

320
00:24:39,380 --> 00:24:41,380
If we got home late,
aunty will nag us again.

321
00:24:43,380 --> 00:24:45,680
Yeah right
I'm under a detention.

322
00:24:47,460 --> 00:24:49,410
Let me just put these away.

323
00:24:49,410 --> 00:24:51,410
I'll leave you here.

324
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:53,280
Will come back and play again.

325
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,750
Hold this for me please.

326
00:24:59,380 --> 00:25:00,750
Just a min.

327
00:25:03,320 --> 00:25:04,590
Hm?

328
00:25:04,590 --> 00:25:06,110
What are you doing, Cake?

329
00:25:06,110 --> 00:25:08,110
Are you tying your shoes?

330
00:25:09,080 --> 00:25:11,260
Hop on.
Piggy ride my back.

331
00:25:11,260 --> 00:25:12,560
Huh?

332
00:25:12,560 --> 00:25:14,560
Ride my back,
just like the old days.

333
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,960
Cake wait for me!

334
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:22,960
I dare you to catch me!

335
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:29,280
Are you okay, Eiw?

336
00:25:32,180 --> 00:25:34,110
Hop on my back.

337
00:25:34,110 --> 00:25:35,570
Do you remember that day?

338
00:25:35,570 --> 00:25:37,330
The day you did piggy ride
my back home.

339
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:39,900
You tripped that day.

340
00:25:39,900 --> 00:25:41,900
Your knees were all scratched
and bled.

341
00:25:42,750 --> 00:25:45,450
You were also crying
until got a hiccup.

342
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:49,120
- You are so bad.
- Bad what?

343
00:25:49,120 --> 00:25:51,120
I was the one who
carried you back home.

344
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:53,120
Cleaned your wound also.

345
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:57,380
At the end,
aunty Proud did it anyway.

346
00:25:58,480 --> 00:25:59,380
Hey!

347
00:25:59,380 --> 00:26:00,970
That was because
you were complaining.

348
00:26:00,970 --> 00:26:03,330
You were crying out loud
'Ow ow. Hurt'.

349
00:26:03,330 --> 00:26:05,330
- Hurt. Hurt.
- Ugh stop mocking me.

350
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:07,810
It's true. You cleaned like
an elephant. (Means heavy hands)

351
00:26:08,450 --> 00:26:10,430
- An elephant?
- Yeah.

352
00:26:10,430 --> 00:26:12,430
Have you ever got
your wound cleaned by one?

353
00:26:12,430 --> 00:26:14,430
Cake!
I will fall for real!

354
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,830
I can carry you trust me.

355
00:26:25,800 --> 00:26:29,250
What did you guys do
when you hung out together?

356
00:26:29,250 --> 00:26:31,250
You mean with Sand?

357
00:26:31,250 --> 00:26:32,550
Yeah.

358
00:26:35,670 --> 00:26:37,780
Why do you wanna know?

359
00:26:37,780 --> 00:26:38,980
Well...

360
00:26:38,980 --> 00:26:41,320
we didn't really talk previously.

361
00:26:41,320 --> 00:26:44,020
I have no clue of
what were you up to.

362
00:26:47,460 --> 00:26:50,100
I just like it better
when we talk to each other more.

363
00:26:51,570 --> 00:26:52,920
So...

364
00:26:52,920 --> 00:26:54,920
you have to tell me, okay?

365
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:56,920
Um.

366
00:26:57,130 --> 00:26:58,920
Then tell me.

367
00:26:59,210 --> 00:27:00,920
Come on.
Tell me.

368
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:05,570
- Hurry, tell me!
- I heard you. Stop before I fall.

369
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:09,340
- Come on.
- Fine!

370
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:11,340
I'll tell you now.

371
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,520
Whan I hung out with Sand?

372
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,820
He often took me to play at the playground
under the toll way.

373
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:21,290
There're lots of squirrel there.

374
00:27:21,290 --> 00:27:24,170
They're so tiny,
but run so fast.

375
00:27:24,170 --> 00:27:28,720
Sometimes we also go to the swing
near by the school.

376
00:27:28,720 --> 00:27:31,740
There's an uncle
selling ice cream as well.

377
00:27:31,740 --> 00:27:34,860
Coconut milk ice cream
on the bread...

378
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:37,610
with sticky rice
and lots of condensed milk.

379
00:27:37,610 --> 00:27:39,610
It's so good.

380
00:27:39,610 --> 00:27:41,610
I also thought of you.
Wanna take you there to try.

381
00:27:42,630 --> 00:27:44,360
Sand also...

382
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:46,250
has 3 siblings.

383
00:27:46,250 --> 00:27:48,760
Naughty like monkeys.
They're really good at climbing.

384
00:27:48,760 --> 00:27:50,760
Even I don't know
how to do it.

385
00:27:52,270 --> 00:27:53,920
But I think...

386
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,870
if you compete with them,
you'll win for sure.

387
00:28:03,590 --> 00:28:05,590
Do you like hanging out
with him?

388
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:10,410
I kinda do.

389
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:12,610
I feel like...

390
00:28:12,610 --> 00:28:15,360
Sand never made me feel bad.

391
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:18,810
He took me to try
lots of new things.

392
00:28:23,390 --> 00:28:25,490
You like it better than
when you're with me?

393
00:28:29,210 --> 00:28:31,490
How can I like it better?

394
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:34,780
You look like you had fun.

395
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,150
Hey! I had fun.
That's why I was happy.

396
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,310
But...

397
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:43,640
being with you...

398
00:28:43,640 --> 00:28:45,640
I feel like I've got everything.

399
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:49,920
What are those things?

400
00:28:51,880 --> 00:28:54,130
Everything.

401
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:02,350
You are smiling, right?

402
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,090
Same as you.

403
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:09,800
You're full of crap.
I'm not smiling.

404
00:29:10,220 --> 00:29:11,780
No.

405
00:29:11,780 --> 00:29:13,780
I meant...

406
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,120
I feel the same way as you.

407
00:29:16,400 --> 00:29:18,120
Feel like I have everything
when I'm with you.

408
00:29:19,530 --> 00:29:20,940
You copied me.

409
00:29:22,090 --> 00:29:23,940
You're smiling!

410
00:29:23,940 --> 00:29:25,080
No I'm not.

411
00:29:25,080 --> 00:29:27,080
- We've arrived home.
- Let's go. We're here.

412
00:29:28,720 --> 00:29:30,110
- I will let you down ok?
- Do it.

413
00:29:30,110 --> 00:29:32,110
- I'm gonna let you down now?
- Um.

414
00:29:32,620 --> 00:29:34,110
Are you tired?

415
00:29:34,770 --> 00:29:37,330
You are so light,
how can I be tired?

416
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,630
Let's go.

417
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,250
Hey!

418
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,500
Cake!

419
00:29:51,500 --> 00:29:53,500
Didn't you see?
I was trying to take the egg.

420
00:29:53,500 --> 00:29:55,500
You didn't see?
Mom look at him!

421
00:29:55,500 --> 00:29:57,660
- I was about to.
- You came after me.

422
00:29:57,660 --> 00:29:59,660
- No!
- I was about to take it first.

423
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:01,900
- Stop.
- Why do you guys have to fight about this?

424
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:03,900
Stop!
Rock paper scissor?

425
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:05,900
- Mom, Cake is lying.
- Be quite, you two!

426
00:30:13,220 --> 00:30:14,620
Hey...

427
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:16,040
you're full already,
See-Eiw?

428
00:30:16,040 --> 00:30:18,040
Yes, I am.

429
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,660
Eat up,
so your weight can catch up with him.

430
00:30:20,660 --> 00:30:23,880
I thought Cake ate all your food
since you were young.

431
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:25,880
How come
you're blaming me?

432
00:30:25,880 --> 00:30:27,060
He just eats little himself.

433
00:30:27,060 --> 00:30:28,640
Yeah.
Eiw eats very little.

434
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:30,640
My height is almost
the same as you already, Eiw.

435
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:36,220
You're such a big bragger
just like who?

436
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:38,850
I'm not gonna let you grow easily.

437
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:41,840
You should eat up,
you know?

438
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:43,840
Since these guys will be there...

439
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:45,840
I assure you.
You wouldn't be able keep up.

440
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:47,840
For sure.

441
00:31:02,920 --> 00:31:05,000
I haven't told him dad.

442
00:31:15,750 --> 00:31:17,760
You're full?

443
00:31:17,760 --> 00:31:19,760
I am.

444
00:31:21,820 --> 00:31:23,290
Well today I won't..

445
00:31:23,290 --> 00:31:25,290
be able to help you
with the dishes mom.

446
00:31:25,290 --> 00:31:27,290
I have to talk to Eiw
about something.

447
00:31:28,660 --> 00:31:31,570
Sure.
Talk it through.

448
00:31:31,570 --> 00:31:33,570
Yes.

449
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,520
Excuse me.

450
00:32:04,240 --> 00:32:06,340
What's wrong Eiw?
Why're you pouting like that?

451
00:32:10,620 --> 00:32:12,690
So what is it?

452
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:18,810
Why don't I understand anything?

453
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:22,270
Why do I have no clue
of what uncle Thanet said?

454
00:32:22,270 --> 00:32:24,270
What did he mean just now?

455
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,430
There?
Where is there?

456
00:32:27,430 --> 00:32:29,890
Why was everyone so quiet
on the table?

457
00:32:45,070 --> 00:32:46,760
Eiw...do you remember...

458
00:32:46,760 --> 00:32:48,760
the thing that
I need to talk to you about?

459
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:52,900
The day
that my mom talked to me.

460
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,510
I've been waiting
for you to tell me.

461
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:01,020
Yeah about that...

462
00:33:06,540 --> 00:33:08,630
Say something.

463
00:33:09,670 --> 00:33:11,690
I know.

464
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,110
But you have to promise to me first?

465
00:33:17,110 --> 00:33:19,270
That you're gonna listen
until the end.

466
00:33:19,270 --> 00:33:20,540
No arguing.

467
00:33:20,540 --> 00:33:21,890
No tears.

468
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:23,890
No tantrums.

469
00:33:23,890 --> 00:33:25,890
You have to listen until I finish.

470
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:27,890
and you can't run away, okay?

471
00:33:29,420 --> 00:33:31,610
What are you trying to tell me?

472
00:33:31,610 --> 00:33:33,610
Promise me first.

473
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,340
I promise.

474
00:33:38,620 --> 00:33:40,680
You can't pretend to promise hm?

475
00:33:42,680 --> 00:33:45,140
I know I'm not pretending.

476
00:33:45,140 --> 00:33:47,140
Just tell me.

477
00:33:57,610 --> 00:33:59,020
So...

478
00:34:01,020 --> 00:34:03,840
my dad has to
go work in America.

479
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:05,450
Like...

480
00:34:05,450 --> 00:34:07,450
helping out
the branch over there.

481
00:34:08,719 --> 00:34:10,020
He said...

482
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:12,020
if he went there,
he'll be promoted.

483
00:34:12,330 --> 00:34:14,020
I'm talking advance promotion.

484
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,949
And if he said yes,

485
00:34:19,150 --> 00:34:21,630
he has to be there for 3 years,

486
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,250
according to the company's contract.

487
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,190
His company...

488
00:34:28,190 --> 00:34:30,190
will provide us a house there.

489
00:34:31,350 --> 00:34:32,920
And...

490
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:35,320
they said that...

491
00:34:35,320 --> 00:34:37,320
all of us can move there.

492
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,040
- So that means--
- Cake...

493
00:34:42,920 --> 00:34:45,040
Are you going to America?

494
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:49,989
You're not gonna be
next to my door anymore?

495
00:34:51,580 --> 00:34:54,480
We're not gonna
go to school together anymore?

496
00:34:55,739 --> 00:34:58,400
We're not going
to see each other everyday, right?

497
00:35:02,310 --> 00:35:04,940
You're not
gonna be with me anymore?

498
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:17,560
Don't just stand there Cake.

499
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
Answer me!

500
00:35:22,070 --> 00:35:23,470
Um.

501
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,910
You're right.
All of it.

502
00:35:28,530 --> 00:35:30,480
But it's only 3 years.

503
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:33,480
I'll be back.

504
00:35:40,370 --> 00:35:42,240
Just 3 years.

505
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:46,940
Just 3 years?

506
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:48,580
I don't understand...

507
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:50,580
how can 3 years is
'just 3 years'?

508
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,250
And...

509
00:36:02,250 --> 00:36:04,250
what can I do?

510
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,370
I don't know.

511
00:36:16,880 --> 00:36:18,020
Then...

512
00:36:18,020 --> 00:36:20,020
can I go home?

513
00:36:20,020 --> 00:36:22,020
Don't!

514
00:36:25,570 --> 00:36:27,760
I wanna wrap
my head around this alone.

515
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:30,700
No.

516
00:36:32,380 --> 00:36:34,260
Please Cake.

517
00:36:35,240 --> 00:36:36,420
If...

518
00:36:36,420 --> 00:36:38,420
I talked to you now...

519
00:36:39,130 --> 00:36:40,960
I don't wanna act like a fool now.

520
00:36:41,390 --> 00:36:44,490
You can be.
I'm okay with it.

521
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:47,450
Cake.

522
00:36:47,450 --> 00:36:49,750
Please don't make me
become a fool.

523
00:36:50,390 --> 00:36:52,160
I don't care.
A fool or not...

524
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:54,160
you can be anything
when you're with me.

525
00:36:55,900 --> 00:36:59,780
And don't you think of
when you're not here anymore?

526
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:04,510
Let me go Cake.

527
00:37:04,510 --> 00:37:06,510
I wanna go home.

528
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:11,350
I'll see you tomorrow.

529
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,920
Let go of me.

530
00:37:23,830 --> 00:37:24,920
Are you...

531
00:37:25,860 --> 00:37:28,430
are you gonna wake me up tomorrow
like usual?

532
00:37:34,270 --> 00:37:35,930
Um.

533
00:37:35,930 --> 00:37:37,930
I will.

534
00:37:41,960 --> 00:37:44,200
Have I ever let you
waking up by yourself?

535
00:37:47,840 --> 00:37:50,700
I'm gonna go.
Let me go Cake.

536
00:37:56,810 --> 00:37:58,700
Good night Eiw.

537
00:39:38,160 --> 00:39:39,660
What's up, Eiw?

538
00:39:41,090 --> 00:39:43,060
- Mama.
- Hm?

539
00:39:43,220 --> 00:39:45,400
Can I have a hug?

540
00:39:46,510 --> 00:39:48,450
Sure son.

541
00:39:55,080 --> 00:39:57,030
What's wrong?

542
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,470
You're a grown up now.

543
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,030
Hm?

544
00:40:12,550 --> 00:40:15,040
Can I sleep in your room tonight?

545
00:40:15,180 --> 00:40:17,040
Sure.

546
00:40:23,110 --> 00:40:25,500
You're not a kid anymore.

547
00:40:27,500 --> 00:40:30,610
Stop crying son.

548
00:40:44,880 --> 00:40:47,200
I wanna spend time with Eiw more.

549
00:40:47,200 --> 00:40:48,960
But we're a couple.

550
00:40:48,960 --> 00:40:50,960
Shouldn't the priority be me?

551
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,080
Are you okay, Cake?

552
00:40:53,080 --> 00:40:55,560
If you would like to cry...

553
00:40:55,560 --> 00:40:57,720
...you can cry.

554
00:40:57,720 --> 00:40:59,560
...you can always cry with me.

555
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:06,880
When you're over there,

556
00:41:06,880 --> 00:41:08,600
please take care of yourself.
