1
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:04,650
I have a story to tell you guys.

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:07,040
It's about this place.

3
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,610
When you first enter this camp site,
there's a huge tree at the entrance.

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,370
People said...

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:16,180
when you go to
the restroom at night...

6
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:18,180
and if you look over...

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:20,920
at the tree...

8
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,920
you will...

9
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,970
You'll see a person siting on the tree
hanging their leg.

10
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:28,890
White...pale...

11
00:00:29,450 --> 00:00:31,340
...and looks creepy

12
00:00:31,740 --> 00:00:33,940
like a dead person.

13
00:00:33,940 --> 00:00:35,610
Be careful you guys.

14
00:00:35,610 --> 00:00:37,610
when you go to the restroom.

15
00:00:37,610 --> 00:00:39,820
They said you might
be able to see it at night.

16
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:41,820
Hey!
You're going back already Eiw?

17
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:43,970
Yeah. I'm tired.

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,750
I'll walk with you.

19
00:00:47,570 --> 00:00:48,750
Let's go.

20
00:00:52,360 --> 00:00:53,930
You don't have to be afraid.

21
00:00:53,930 --> 00:00:55,930
There's nothing.
Look!

22
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,930
It's so dark.

23
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,420
Good night Eiw.
See you tomorrow.

24
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:04,420
Um. See you.

25
00:01:04,420 --> 00:01:05,580
- Bye.
- You can go back by yourself?

26
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:07,360
- Yes. I'm fine.
- Ok.

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:09,360
I'm gonna go.
Just go in.

28
00:01:09,530 --> 00:01:10,980
Um.

29
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:25,580
Hey Eiw!
Where've you been?

30
00:01:26,620 --> 00:01:28,900
Fee invited me
to the other room.

31
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:33,120
And why are you
making a weird face?

32
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:35,020
Cause those guys were
talking about creepy stories.

33
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,690
Huh?
Like ghost story?

34
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:39,810
Why did you listen to them then?

35
00:01:39,810 --> 00:01:41,810
I didn't want to but...

36
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,960
I didn't wanna walk back
here alone that's why.

37
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,440
Why didn't you ask Fee
to walk you here?

38
00:01:49,440 --> 00:01:50,990
No.

39
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:52,990
I didn't wanna interrupt
other people.

40
00:01:54,530 --> 00:01:56,650
You're too considerate.

41
00:01:57,500 --> 00:01:58,920
Come sleep on my side.

42
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:00,060
I will ask this guy for you.

43
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:02,060
No. No.

44
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:04,810
I don't wanna make a big deal
to other people.

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:07,180
It's okay.
I'll talk to him for you.

46
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,750
Can you switch
your bed with Eiw?

47
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:12,350
Sure.

48
00:02:12,350 --> 00:02:14,350
Thanks dude.

49
00:02:15,480 --> 00:02:17,470
Thank you so much.

50
00:02:40,670 --> 00:02:41,970
Eiw?

51
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:45,380
Can you sleep?

52
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:50,530
Are you scared?

53
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:53,050
I am.

54
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:00,170
Come lay with me here.

55
00:03:00,520 --> 00:03:02,170
Come!

56
00:03:11,710 --> 00:03:14,210
Why did you have to listen,
if you're so scared like this?

57
00:03:14,210 --> 00:03:16,210
I didn't wanna ruin their mood.

58
00:03:16,210 --> 00:03:18,210
You would not.

59
00:03:19,520 --> 00:03:21,930
Go to sleep.
Sweet dream.

60
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:23,930
Sweet dream,Eiw.

61
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:26,840
Sweet dream, Cake.

62
00:03:27,730 --> 00:03:29,030
Aww.

63
00:03:37,880 --> 00:03:39,730
Close your eyes.

64
00:04:57,640 --> 00:04:59,260
Here. Here.

65
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:02,460
Are you alright Chai?

66
00:05:17,240 --> 00:05:18,930
Don't shake it!

67
00:05:24,930 --> 00:05:26,680
Kung don't do that!

68
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,680
Are you okay there Eiw?

69
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:33,000
Yeah. You can do it,
so you can brag.

70
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:51,060
You look so happy.

71
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:52,030
Hmm?

72
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:54,540
Why? I like it.

73
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:57,710
Especially climbing on rope,
my favorite!

74
00:05:57,710 --> 00:05:59,710
I don't like it at all.

75
00:06:00,430 --> 00:06:02,740
Do you like it, Kung?

76
00:06:02,740 --> 00:06:05,690
I'm ok. Kinda neutral.
Just play along with it.

77
00:06:07,130 --> 00:06:08,990
Ok. I'll just go first.

78
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:11,850
Cake goes after Eiw, Ok?

79
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:12,850
Sure.

80
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:14,590
Go.

81
00:06:14,590 --> 00:06:16,590
Be careful Kung.

82
00:06:30,580 --> 00:06:32,060
Eiw!

83
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:47,080
I fell off.

84
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,080
You intentionally did that.

85
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:51,080
So you won't be
the only one.

86
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:17,960
Rinse it off.

87
00:07:25,060 --> 00:07:27,060
Hey Cake!
You're bleeding.

88
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:28,210
Hm?

89
00:07:28,210 --> 00:07:30,210
Probably something
in the water scratched me.

90
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,630
Enough. Enough.

91
00:07:31,630 --> 00:07:34,210
The water is dirty.
Hurry! Go clean the wound at the first aid tent.

92
00:07:34,210 --> 00:07:35,250
I'm fine.

93
00:07:35,250 --> 00:07:37,470
Go!
Go clean your wound please.

94
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:38,570
You can't. The water is dirty.

95
00:07:38,570 --> 00:07:40,190
Let it go.
Go clean your wound.

96
00:07:40,190 --> 00:07:43,970
- No I wanna go back and play.
- No. You need to clean your wound first,

97
00:07:44,450 --> 00:07:46,520
- Don't be stubborn.
- It's no fun.

98
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:52,409
- Easy there teacher.
- All done.

99
00:07:52,409 --> 00:07:54,409
Don't get the wound
wet for a day please.

100
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:57,980
Oh so that means I cannot
play any other activities anymore?

101
00:07:59,490 --> 00:08:02,750
If that means you have
to be in the water, so yes.

102
00:08:05,480 --> 00:08:07,970
Ok Miss.
Thank you.

103
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,510
Cake.

104
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:15,230
It was because I fell off.

105
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:17,720
Hmm?...not at all.

106
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:24,190
How can it not? If I didn't fall,
then you wouldn't fall with me.

107
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:26,050
I wanted to fall.

108
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,680
The weather is hot.

109
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,150
So hot.

110
00:08:29,150 --> 00:08:31,150
That's a big excuse.

111
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:33,150
That's why you're hurt.

112
00:08:34,919 --> 00:08:37,020
Don't be overthinking.

113
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:38,020
I know.

114
00:08:38,020 --> 00:08:39,880
I was just worried about you.

115
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:41,880
I know.

116
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:43,970
Are you sure
you're not hurt?

117
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:45,250
No I'm not.

118
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:46,750
Hey.

119
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:48,620
Ahh.

120
00:08:48,620 --> 00:08:50,620
That's enough Cake!

121
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:53,840
Sit down before
your wound gets worse.

122
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:55,840
It's totally nothing.

123
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:11,050
Why aren't you asleep?

124
00:09:11,050 --> 00:09:13,050
I'm waiting for you.
Where've you been?

125
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:15,600
Why didn't you tell me?
I was worried.

126
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,600
Sorry I was on a phone.

127
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:19,310
For too long.

128
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:21,310
Talked to your family?

129
00:09:21,310 --> 00:09:23,310
Nope.
I was talking to Rin,

130
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,090
Oh...

131
00:09:25,090 --> 00:09:27,090
I didn't call her yesterday.
Kinda miss her.

132
00:09:33,180 --> 00:09:36,000
Hm? What's wrong?
Are you mad at me?

133
00:09:37,180 --> 00:09:38,440
No I'm not.

134
00:09:38,440 --> 00:09:41,470
I'm sorry.
I had to look for the reception for awhile.

135
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:43,520
Are you going to sleep now?

136
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,520
Yeah.
I'm going to sleep now.

137
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,000
Do you wanna sleep on my side?

138
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:51,680
Why?

139
00:09:52,420 --> 00:09:53,970
I'm not scared anymore.

140
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:55,970
Good night Cake.

141
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:00,410
Not scared anymore?

142
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:07,740
Good night Eiw.

143
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,140
Time flies so damn fast.
We're about to go home.

144
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,970
Not at all!

145
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,970
I want to go home so bad.

146
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:58,970
The bed is super hard.

147
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:01,850
Yeah.

148
00:11:01,850 --> 00:11:04,280
I wanna go home for
a warm shower so damn much.

149
00:11:04,280 --> 00:11:06,000
I have to prepare myself
for 30 mins

150
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:07,500
every time
I'm gonna shower here.

151
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:09,500
The water is so damn cold.

152
00:11:10,830 --> 00:11:12,990
You guys are so snobbish.

153
00:11:18,490 --> 00:11:19,960
Hey. I'm done.

154
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:23,950
Listen to me!

155
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:24,850
You too!

156
00:11:24,850 --> 00:11:27,170
- Give me back my toothpaste when you're done.
- Ok.

157
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:29,170
Hey dude!
There's something on your face.

158
00:11:29,170 --> 00:11:31,170
- What?
- I'll rinse it off for you.

159
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,420
I will get back
to you at the room.

160
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:37,420
You're such a big bully huh?

161
00:11:37,420 --> 00:11:39,420
Hey!

162
00:12:06,750 --> 00:12:08,520
Morning.

163
00:12:54,210 --> 00:12:56,200
"Proud's Bakery"
"Mama's Dim Sum"

164
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,200
Here's your food.

165
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:01,370
- Hi aunty Proud.
- Hi mom.

166
00:13:02,780 --> 00:13:04,990
Yes!
Finally home.

167
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:08,980
Are you coming over
when you're done?

168
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,200
Um. I'll go back and have dinner first.

169
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,480
Then shower and
I'll see you later tonight.

170
00:13:16,080 --> 00:13:18,090
Ok. See ya.

171
00:13:18,090 --> 00:13:20,090
- See ya.
- Please hurry.

172
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:28,030
Good evening mom.
I'm back.

173
00:13:28,970 --> 00:13:30,980
How was it?
Did you have a good time?

174
00:13:31,540 --> 00:13:34,520
Yeah. It was good mom.

175
00:13:34,520 --> 00:13:37,850
There's Fish Maw soup.
You wanna have it now?

176
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,210
Umm..

177
00:13:39,210 --> 00:13:41,680
I'll go put my bag away
and get change.

178
00:13:41,680 --> 00:13:43,680
I will come down to eat in a bit.

179
00:13:48,540 --> 00:13:50,590
Did he actually have a good  time?

180
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:22,980
Cake.

181
00:15:24,430 --> 00:15:26,020
Cake.

182
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:29,960
Cake!

183
00:15:31,340 --> 00:15:32,700
What's up?

184
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:35,990
What time are you gonna go to bed?

185
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,720
You're sleepy already?

186
00:15:41,300 --> 00:15:42,430
Um.

187
00:15:42,430 --> 00:15:44,430
It's almost 10pm.

188
00:15:45,470 --> 00:15:47,110
If you're sleepy,
then go ahead.

189
00:15:47,110 --> 00:15:49,480
I'll shut down the computer
and make a call for a bit.

190
00:15:51,820 --> 00:15:53,500
Oh. ok.

191
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:55,480
I will go to sleep soon.

192
00:15:55,480 --> 00:15:58,480
I assure you
I'm not gonna be late tomorrow.

193
00:16:13,220 --> 00:16:15,360
Hello?

194
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:29,300
Hm?

195
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,350
Why're you still awake?

196
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:36,090
I can't sleep.

197
00:16:41,530 --> 00:16:43,470
Are you ok?
Why can't you sleep?

198
00:16:45,900 --> 00:16:47,940
You're still awake too.

199
00:16:49,380 --> 00:16:51,460
Sorry.
I was caught in the moment.

200
00:16:52,230 --> 00:16:54,510
So what's up?
Why are you awake?

201
00:16:56,580 --> 00:16:58,120
I don't know.

202
00:17:13,720 --> 00:17:15,190
Come here.

203
00:17:18,819 --> 00:17:20,510
What's wrong?

204
00:17:22,510 --> 00:17:24,510
I don't know.
I don't know what I'm feeling.

205
00:17:27,480 --> 00:17:29,590
Then go to sleep.

206
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:31,590
It's past your bedtime already.

207
00:17:52,670 --> 00:17:53,700
Cake.

208
00:17:57,700 --> 00:17:59,470
Why don't you go to sleep?

209
00:18:00,720 --> 00:18:02,490
What's the matter?
Tell me.

210
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,060
I can't sleep.

211
00:18:06,550 --> 00:18:08,110
Yeah.

212
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:10,110
What makes you awake?

213
00:18:16,950 --> 00:18:19,480
Am I still important to you Cake?

214
00:18:22,950 --> 00:18:24,510
Yes you are.

215
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,460
What's wrong?

216
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:30,270
Why do you ask like this?

217
00:18:31,050 --> 00:18:32,490
You miss your dad?

218
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:34,490
No.

219
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:40,060
You're always
important to me, Eiw.

220
00:18:41,000 --> 00:18:42,510
Always.

221
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:47,460
There's no such time
where you're not important to me, ok?

222
00:18:50,990 --> 00:18:52,440
Close your eyes.

223
00:18:52,800 --> 00:18:54,440
You'll be able to sleep soon.

224
00:19:15,390 --> 00:19:16,830
Hey. There he is.

225
00:19:16,830 --> 00:19:19,370
I finished the report.
You go hand it in.

226
00:19:19,370 --> 00:19:21,000
Shit!

227
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:23,120
I totally forgot that I have to do
the report with you Cake.

228
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:24,600
It's not just forget...

229
00:19:24,600 --> 00:19:25,980
did you even know
that we have to do it?

230
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:27,790
- When is the due date?
- tomorrow.

231
00:19:27,790 --> 00:19:29,550
Screw us.

232
00:19:29,550 --> 00:19:31,550
You didn't remind me shithead!

233
00:19:31,550 --> 00:19:33,550
I also forgot about it as well.

234
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:36,920
Eiw reminded me
like 3 times already.

235
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:38,920
If he finds out abut this,
I'm gonna be deaf.

236
00:19:38,920 --> 00:19:40,600
What are you guys so afraid of?

237
00:19:40,600 --> 00:19:42,490
It's a one night miracle for you guys.

238
00:19:42,490 --> 00:19:43,530
One night miracle?

239
00:19:43,530 --> 00:19:45,530
Come sleep over
at my place then!

240
00:19:45,660 --> 00:19:47,110
You!  Come to my place.

241
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:49,110
If I go over to your place
then you work on it ok?

242
00:19:49,110 --> 00:19:51,500
What? No. I'm lazy to pack
my bag and go to yours.

243
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:55,510
You're the same size as me.
You can borrow mine.

244
00:19:56,060 --> 00:19:57,750
Please. Just come over.

245
00:19:57,750 --> 00:19:59,750
- Please. Please.
- Fine!

246
00:19:59,750 --> 00:20:01,750
- Deal?
- Sure. Sure.

247
00:20:03,500 --> 00:20:06,200
- Eiw's gonna kill me.
- Fighting y'all!

248
00:20:10,620 --> 00:20:13,480
I played games with Ta.
He was such a cheater as I told you.

249
00:20:14,010 --> 00:20:15,480
- The one with big bicep?
- Yeah.

250
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,400
Er...Cake?

251
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:18,840
Ha?

252
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:20,840
I'm not going over today.

253
00:20:21,610 --> 00:20:24,010
So you can hang with your friend.

254
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:26,010
We're not hanging out We're--

255
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,620
See you tomorrow.

256
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:30,620
- Um.
- Yes.

257
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,880
- Oh Cake!
- Hm?

258
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:35,460
My mom made lots of
Toddy Palm cake yesterday.

259
00:20:35,460 --> 00:20:37,980
If you wanna have some,
feel free to go get it.

260
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,280
I will put it on a plate for you.

261
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:40,580
Ok.

262
00:20:41,130 --> 00:20:42,010
See you tomorrow.

263
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,860
Ok.
I'm going in now.

264
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:45,160
Bye.

265
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,610
F*ck you.
You elbowed me too hard.

266
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,060
Yeah you talk too much.

267
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:53,480
Mom I'm home.
Good evening.

268
00:21:03,280 --> 00:21:04,840
I'm so hungry.

269
00:21:07,190 --> 00:21:08,500
What the hell?

270
00:21:09,480 --> 00:21:10,500
Here.

271
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,590
How can you be hungry?
You just ate with me.

272
00:21:18,320 --> 00:21:20,300
It's all digested.

273
00:21:20,300 --> 00:21:22,300
The snack in front of you.
Just eat the damn thing.

274
00:21:23,140 --> 00:21:26,000
If not then go get the
Toddy Palm Cake from Eiw's.

275
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,620
You go get it.

276
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:29,480
I'm not the one
who's hungry.

277
00:21:29,480 --> 00:21:31,480
You're hungry,
you should go get it.

278
00:21:32,520 --> 00:21:34,960
I'm the guest here.

279
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,360
What guest?
Guess you're damn right.

280
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,360
Go get it yourself.

281
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:44,600
Why're you still here?
Go get it. Go!

282
00:21:44,600 --> 00:21:46,460
Hey Hey.

283
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:48,460
If I go get it,
you don't have the right to eat.

284
00:21:52,940 --> 00:21:54,800
I'm gonna eat it anyway.

285
00:21:56,800 --> 00:21:58,900
Hey this shithead!

286
00:21:59,800 --> 00:22:01,160
See you.

287
00:22:12,090 --> 00:22:14,040
Er...excuse me.

288
00:22:29,080 --> 00:22:31,430
I'm here to get the
Toddy Palm for Cake.

289
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:33,200
Toddy Palm?

290
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:35,700
Oh the one that
Eiw put it on the plate, right?

291
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:37,700
Wait a minute.

292
00:22:45,660 --> 00:22:47,040
Um.

293
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:49,040
Here.
Share it with Cake.

294
00:23:01,680 --> 00:23:03,290
Thank you.

295
00:23:03,290 --> 00:23:04,290
Sure.

296
00:23:10,510 --> 00:23:11,940
She's so cute.

297
00:23:18,910 --> 00:23:20,870
Very good servant.

298
00:23:21,340 --> 00:23:22,870
Wow.

299
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,920
Wow.

300
00:23:27,920 --> 00:23:29,480
Motherf*ker.

301
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,480
If you're not gonna eat,
you can just tell me.

302
00:23:31,480 --> 00:23:34,560
Give me your head
before you sit down.

303
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,330
Clean that up too.

304
00:23:47,610 --> 00:23:48,500
This is good.

305
00:23:48,500 --> 00:23:49,500
Hey.

306
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,500
What's up?

307
00:23:52,110 --> 00:23:54,400
When I went over to Eiw's just now...

308
00:23:54,400 --> 00:23:56,520
I met girl.

309
00:23:56,520 --> 00:23:58,520
Who is she?

310
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:03,630
Was it Hom?

311
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:05,630
Eiw's sister.

312
00:24:07,870 --> 00:24:09,500
His sister's name is Hom?

313
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,510
Yes.

314
00:24:10,510 --> 00:24:11,810
Ton-Hom.

315
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:26,070
Why does it take forever Eiw?

316
00:24:29,680 --> 00:24:31,680
Cake went to see Rin.

317
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,940
Oh.

318
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,790
Are you hungry?

319
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:45,790
Hmm?

320
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,190
Not really.

321
00:24:49,190 --> 00:24:52,070
You ate only a little during lunch.

322
00:24:53,070 --> 00:24:55,060
My appetite is not good lately.

323
00:24:58,410 --> 00:25:00,920
Let me ask you for real Eiw.

324
00:25:00,920 --> 00:25:03,480
You're not bored of
waiting for him everyday?

325
00:25:04,830 --> 00:25:06,710
You don't have
to wait anymore.

326
00:25:06,710 --> 00:25:09,350
You house and Kung's are super close.

327
00:25:09,350 --> 00:25:11,350
You can go home with Kung too.

328
00:25:14,950 --> 00:25:16,600
That's fine.

329
00:25:16,600 --> 00:25:18,100
I can wait.

330
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:20,100
I want to wait.

331
00:25:20,810 --> 00:25:22,250
But...

332
00:25:22,250 --> 00:25:25,180
I won't be able to wait with you
like this anymore.

333
00:25:25,470 --> 00:25:27,180
I have to be at the Drama club.

334
00:25:27,660 --> 00:25:28,730
Um.

335
00:25:28,730 --> 00:25:30,730
It's totally fine Fee.

336
00:25:30,870 --> 00:25:32,030
I...

337
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,490
wait for him a bit,
and he'll show up soon.

338
00:25:35,160 --> 00:25:37,560
It's been an hour already
...is that a bit?

339
00:25:39,470 --> 00:25:40,550
Well...

340
00:25:40,550 --> 00:25:42,730
I look at this and that to kill time.

341
00:25:42,730 --> 00:25:44,730
Cake'll be here soon.

342
00:25:45,830 --> 00:25:48,300
Or if I get super bored, then I...

343
00:25:48,300 --> 00:25:50,300
I'll just take the bus home.

344
00:25:51,770 --> 00:25:54,150
Even you've never gone home alone?

345
00:26:02,680 --> 00:26:04,600
Do you wanna join
Drama club with me?

346
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:06,600
I'll talk to the senior for you.

347
00:26:06,870 --> 00:26:08,410
No. No.
Better not Fee.

348
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:10,940
I don't think I can do it.

349
00:26:11,310 --> 00:26:13,480
I'm comfortable being like this.

350
00:26:14,200 --> 00:26:17,480
If not then you should go find
some books to read while waiting.

351
00:26:17,480 --> 00:26:20,110
So you don't have
to be here alone.

352
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,630
Yeah. Sure.

353
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:25,500
I'll switch to waiting
at the library too, ok?

354
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:29,050
You should go to your club already.
You'll be late.

355
00:26:29,050 --> 00:26:30,020
Ok.

356
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,630
I'll go then.

357
00:26:31,630 --> 00:26:33,030
Yeah go.
I'll be fine.

358
00:26:33,030 --> 00:26:35,030
Get home safely, Eiw.

359
00:26:35,220 --> 00:26:37,760
- Bye. See ya.
- See you. Thank you.

360
00:27:41,310 --> 00:27:42,470
Hi there.

361
00:27:42,940 --> 00:27:44,790
I'm Sand.

362
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,520
What's your name?
May I ask?

363
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:54,030
I'm See-Eiw.

364
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:57,150
Yeah.

365
00:27:57,150 --> 00:27:58,890
I walk pass here everyday.

366
00:27:58,890 --> 00:28:00,890
I always see you siting here.

367
00:28:01,340 --> 00:28:03,530
Even I go home late
I still see you here.

368
00:28:05,060 --> 00:28:07,600
Oh.
I'm waiting for a friend actually.

369
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:08,880
Well...

370
00:28:08,880 --> 00:28:10,880
If I go home and see you here,

371
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,470
Can I sit and talk to you here?

372
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,500
But I'm not very
good at talking.

373
00:28:17,080 --> 00:28:19,800
It's okay.
I don't have a lot of friends.

374
00:28:19,800 --> 00:28:22,660
I always see you here alone.
I've wanted to talk to you for so long.

375
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:24,500
If you're ok with that.

376
00:28:24,500 --> 00:28:26,400
I'm ok with that.

377
00:28:26,400 --> 00:28:29,060
If Sand is not going
to get bored of me first.

378
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:30,470
I won't.

379
00:28:30,470 --> 00:28:32,470
I'm not good at talking either.

380
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:34,470
Or..

381
00:28:34,650 --> 00:28:36,960
I could say.
I don't have someone to talk to as much.

382
00:28:38,470 --> 00:28:40,970
Then nice to meet you.

383
00:28:41,740 --> 00:28:43,460
Nice to meed you
too See-Eiw.

384
00:28:48,830 --> 00:28:50,520
The neighbor found us...

385
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:52,700
My brother was surprised
and jumped down the tree.

386
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:53,880
- Really?
- Yeah.

387
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:56,010
His bump was so sore.

388
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,010
That's funny.
So what did you guys do?

389
00:28:58,340 --> 00:29:00,490
What can we do?
We were in pain.

390
00:29:00,490 --> 00:29:02,490
Quite awhile before
we could get up properly.

391
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:04,490
Poor thing.

392
00:29:04,490 --> 00:29:06,490
It's kinda funny.

393
00:29:06,490 --> 00:29:08,820
You've never climbed on a tree?

394
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,020
Me?
Never.

395
00:29:11,020 --> 00:29:12,500
I don't have the strength.

396
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,870
I can't do it.

397
00:29:13,870 --> 00:29:15,240
Yeah. I think so.

398
00:29:15,240 --> 00:29:17,100
You look thin.

399
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
Really?
But I feed my self full every meal.

400
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:22,110
But yeah...
my family also says I eat very little.

401
00:29:22,110 --> 00:29:24,500
Probably that's all
my stomach can fit.

402
00:29:24,500 --> 00:29:26,500
Probably.

403
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,510
*Sigh*

404
00:29:30,510 --> 00:29:33,280
You're so lucky.
Have so many younger siblings.

405
00:29:33,280 --> 00:29:36,080
A lot.
3 younger brothers.

406
00:29:36,080 --> 00:29:38,080
Naughty like baby monkeys.

407
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:47,240
Yeah...anyways...

408
00:29:48,940 --> 00:29:50,510
What's the matter?

409
00:29:52,730 --> 00:29:54,550
My family doesn't have
a lot of money.

410
00:29:54,550 --> 00:29:57,450
It's a bit difficult
feeding so many kids.

411
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:05,750
Hey, but on the bright side...

412
00:30:05,750 --> 00:30:07,750
I'm very happy.

413
00:30:07,750 --> 00:30:09,750
I'm not alone.
I have many siblings.

414
00:30:11,050 --> 00:30:14,080
Yeah. I think your house would be
joyful with that many people.

415
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:16,500
Do you wanna come hangout
at my place sometime?

416
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:19,040
If you don't mind
the small size of it.

417
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:20,810
Hey how come?
I don't mind at all.

418
00:30:20,810 --> 00:30:22,430
My house is small too.

419
00:30:22,430 --> 00:30:23,660
- Really?
- Yes.

420
00:30:23,660 --> 00:30:24,780
Then come over?

421
00:30:24,780 --> 00:30:26,280
I'll let you meet my brothers.

422
00:30:26,280 --> 00:30:28,920
I'll let them climb up and get
the neighbor's mangos for you too.

423
00:30:28,920 --> 00:30:30,260
No.

424
00:30:30,260 --> 00:30:33,100
What if they get caught
by your neighbors?

425
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:35,100
No they won't.
Please come over?

426
00:30:35,770 --> 00:30:37,100
They won't.

427
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:39,420
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

428
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
Ok.

429
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,030
"Mama's Dim Sum"

430
00:30:46,030 --> 00:30:48,180
Cake come on.
Finish your homework.

431
00:30:48,180 --> 00:30:49,800
So we can hangout on weekends.

432
00:30:49,800 --> 00:30:50,510
No.

433
00:30:50,510 --> 00:30:53,070
See Practice 2 has so many questions.

434
00:30:53,070 --> 00:30:54,800
- If you're lazy...
- You can just do it tomorrow.

435
00:30:54,800 --> 00:30:56,420
I bought you guys this.

436
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:57,800
Famous sponge cake.

437
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,800
- Thank you.
- Wow sis. Thank you.

438
00:31:00,170 --> 00:31:02,940
Yeah.
When it comes to this, you're so fast.

439
00:31:02,940 --> 00:31:04,160
Ow.

440
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:05,980
You never actually do your homework.

441
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,460
Oh!
Actually I wanna ask you two.

442
00:31:07,460 --> 00:31:09,930
Do you guys free this weekend?

443
00:31:09,930 --> 00:31:11,930
There's a play at my university.

444
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:14,860
We need some help with the scene setting.

445
00:31:14,860 --> 00:31:16,540
Are you guys interested to help?
It'll be fun.

446
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:18,540
Sure.
It sounds fun.

447
00:31:18,950 --> 00:31:20,950
What about you Eiw?
Do you wanna join Cake?

448
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:27,520
Not really sis.
I'll pass.

449
00:31:27,520 --> 00:31:29,520
It's not my thing.

450
00:31:29,670 --> 00:31:31,310
You can just come with me.

451
00:31:31,310 --> 00:31:33,310
It'll be fun.
Nothing serious. Try it.

452
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:36,070
No Cake.

453
00:31:39,130 --> 00:31:41,340
Then I'm not going.

454
00:31:41,340 --> 00:31:42,400
What?

455
00:31:42,400 --> 00:31:45,000
Cake I'm fine.
You can go.

456
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,490
Go help Hom,
so she can go home early sometimes.

457
00:31:48,630 --> 00:31:50,090
Please go.

458
00:31:50,090 --> 00:31:50,910
Are you sure?

459
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,340
Um. I'm fine.
A chance like this doesn't come often.

460
00:31:55,340 --> 00:31:56,900
Well...

461
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,190
Can I bring another
3 friends with me?

462
00:31:59,190 --> 00:32:01,190
Yeah. Sure.
Bring them along.

463
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:03,190
There're lots of things to do.

464
00:32:03,190 --> 00:32:05,470
Cake is sad.
Are you sure you're not goin?

465
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:07,770
Nope.

466
00:32:07,770 --> 00:32:09,300
Don't change the subject.

467
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,790
Do your homework, Cake.

468
00:32:10,790 --> 00:32:13,550
Don't just eat.
Finish your homework too.

469
00:32:13,550 --> 00:32:15,210
You'll be playing the whole weekend.

470
00:32:15,210 --> 00:32:17,210
And then copy my homework
on Monday.

471
00:32:17,620 --> 00:32:20,790
There're so many subjects.
If you don't it now, don't beg to copy mine.

472
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:21,790
No more.

473
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:23,790
Sis.

474
00:32:27,190 --> 00:32:30,010
Here.
Paint it like the example.

475
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:37,980
The paint in there is already mixed.
You can use it.

476
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:39,980
It's not difficult,
just a lot.

477
00:32:40,390 --> 00:32:43,180
It's fine.
We've got nothing to do.

478
00:32:45,800 --> 00:32:47,100
Hom.

479
00:32:47,740 --> 00:32:49,960
Come help with the final scene please.

480
00:32:49,960 --> 00:32:51,960
Ok. I'll be there in a min.

481
00:32:53,930 --> 00:32:55,480
Then you guys can get started.

482
00:32:55,480 --> 00:32:58,150
If you have any question,
you can ask anyone here.

483
00:32:58,150 --> 00:32:59,240
They know everything.

484
00:32:59,240 --> 00:33:01,240
Yes. Copied that.

485
00:33:01,910 --> 00:33:03,910
Leave it to us.

486
00:33:08,670 --> 00:33:10,000
Cake.

487
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,370
Where're the girls?

488
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:13,370
There's none here.

489
00:33:17,680 --> 00:33:19,100
Girls?

490
00:33:19,100 --> 00:33:21,100
Over there.

491
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:25,360
Come on.

492
00:33:25,360 --> 00:33:28,040
You're here to work,
why do you guys care about girls so much?

493
00:33:28,040 --> 00:33:30,040
Go. Go.
Prepare the stuff.

494
00:33:43,710 --> 00:33:45,480
Why're you smiling?

495
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:50,760
You've got something
and you don't tell your friends?

496
00:33:53,190 --> 00:33:54,410
What can it be?

497
00:33:54,410 --> 00:33:56,410
Just do your job.

498

00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:04,500
Fuck.

500
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:07,990
You're blushing.
Wanna put on some color?

501
00:34:07,990 --> 00:34:09,989
You guys are so nasty.

502
00:34:12,480 --> 00:34:14,920
What about Palm?
Where did he go?

503
00:34:15,670 --> 00:34:17,550
He went to the bathroom
since this morning.

504
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,550
Diarrhea.

505
00:34:19,550 --> 00:34:21,260
- Diarrhea?
- Yeah.

506
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,260
What did he eat?

507
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,870
Ugh. Shit.

508
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,199
Dude.

509
00:34:33,199 --> 00:34:36,000
- That was bad.
- Oh. Here he is.

510
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:38,320
Has the toilet exploded?

511
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:41,000
How's it goin guys?

512
00:34:42,380 --> 00:34:43,639
Hi.

513
00:34:43,830 --> 00:34:45,480
What do you think?

514
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:46,409
Looks good?

515
00:34:46,409 --> 00:34:47,880
Good.

516
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:49,070
I tell you...

517
00:34:49,070 --> 00:34:50,580
I'll give it a 10 for neatness.

518
00:34:50,580 --> 00:34:52,980
I put a lot of effort into this.

519
00:34:53,770 --> 00:34:56,489
But I'll give your confident level a 100.

520
00:34:58,010 --> 00:34:59,600
What do you want from me?

521
00:34:59,600 --> 00:35:00,650
What do you want?

522
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:03,920
When is it going to finish
playing like this?

523
00:35:03,920 --> 00:35:05,640
Here.
Let me help.

524
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,640
Yes ma'am.

525
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:09,190
Are you done on that side ?

526
00:35:09,190 --> 00:35:11,040
Yeah It's done.

527
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:12,550
That's why I come here to help.

528
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:14,550
You guys are slow.

529
00:35:14,780 --> 00:35:16,810
Cause Peak's mind
was somewhere else.

530
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:19,200
He didn't help at all.

531
00:35:19,200 --> 00:35:21,200
See. You smeared it over here.

532
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:23,690
What!?

533
00:35:26,330 --> 00:35:28,460
It's you. So messy.

534
00:35:33,150 --> 00:35:34,520
Hey.

535
00:35:36,020 --> 00:35:37,800
You've got a little paint on your face.

536
00:35:53,160 --> 00:35:55,160
Thank you.

537
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,090
I will just go wash it off.

538
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,090
You guys please continue.

539
00:36:01,210 --> 00:36:03,920
This dude is making a move already.

540
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:08,480
- You've got something on your face.
- Hey!

541
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,480
I think I will go wash it off.

542
00:36:15,280 --> 00:36:17,000
Awww.

543
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:18,000
Ugh.

544
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:25,150
You face is messy.

545
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:27,500

Eat up kids.

548
00:36:36,720 --> 00:36:38,300
I miss the old days
when we were young.

549
00:36:38,630 --> 00:36:39,670
So yummy.

550
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:40,910
I miss home-cooked food.

551
00:36:40,910 --> 00:36:42,910
Haven't had it for days.

552
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:46,430
Are  you staying at home tonight?
Both of you?

553
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:49,050
I'm probably not gonna
stay here tonight cause...

554
00:36:49,050 --> 00:36:50,750
my projects are almost due.

555
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:52,010
and I haven't finished it either.

556
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:55,460
I came to get some clothes
and I'll be back the day after tomorrow.

557
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,180
What about Ton-Hom?

558
00:36:58,180 --> 00:36:59,590
I'll stay here tonight.

559
00:36:59,590 --> 00:37:01,590
My projects are ahead of the plan.

560
00:37:01,590 --> 00:37:03,180
I'm so tired.
Just wanna rest.

561
00:37:03,180 --> 00:37:04,890
That's good.

562
00:37:04,890 --> 00:37:08,180
You can rest for a little bit,
you'll be hectic again trust me.

563
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:10,180
At least I get to rest.

564
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,850
แกอะ....

565
00:37:11,850 --> 00:37:13,850
Wow.

566
00:37:15,560 --> 00:37:16,910
Eat up children.

567
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,490
This dish is good.

568
00:37:29,990 --> 00:37:32,140
Eat some.

569
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,500
So good.

"Mama's Dim Sum"

00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,940
Eiw.

572
00:37:52,090 --> 00:37:53,510
Eiw.

573
00:37:53,510 --> 00:37:55,510
- Eiw.
- Yes?

574
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,460
What's the matter?
You seem quite today.

575
00:38:00,570 --> 00:38:02,150
No I'm not.

576
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,080
I'm fine.

577
00:38:04,080 --> 00:38:06,080
Really?

578
00:38:08,580 --> 00:38:12,360
I rented a movie today.
Wanna watch with me?

579
00:38:12,890 --> 00:38:14,500
What movie?

580
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:15,740
Thai movie.

581
00:38:15,740 --> 00:38:17,740
My friend said it's good.

582
00:38:20,590 --> 00:38:23,140
I guarantee you
it's not a horror movie.

583
00:38:23,140 --> 00:38:25,140
Are you free?

584
00:38:27,140 --> 00:38:29,110
I am.

585
00:38:29,110 --> 00:38:31,110
I'm not doing anything today anyway.

586
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:33,110
Ok than let's watch
a movie together.

587
00:38:34,080 --> 00:38:35,980
Put the plate away.

588

"Love of Siam"

00:40:14,440 --> 00:40:15,420
I...

590
00:40:15,420 --> 00:40:17,420
I think we should stop watching this.

591
00:40:20,980 --> 00:40:23,370
Are you hungry? I'll...

592
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:25,370
bring you some milk, should I?

593
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:28,280
Er...I'm full.

594
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:30,280
I'm sleepy.

595
00:40:30,670 --> 00:40:32,280
Then...

596
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,960
You go to sleep.

597
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:35,960
I'll go up soon too.

598
00:40:35,960 --> 00:40:38,180
Um.
Excuse me, I'm going to bed then.

599
00:41:59,400 --> 00:42:01,030
New friend?

00:42:01,030 --> 00:42:01,860
Cake.

601
00:42:01,860 --> 00:42:04,780
I can take care of myself,
can you just leave me alone?

602
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,650
Are you ok?

603
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,400
You seem off lately.

604
00:42:08,400 --> 00:42:10,400
I'm fine.

605
00:42:12,040 --> 00:42:13,770
But I think...

606
00:42:13,770 --> 00:42:15,770
I feel that way with Cake.

607
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:17,370
Eiw.

608
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,280
Shit the light looks super creepy.

609
00:43:32,430 --> 00:43:33,990
You lead the way.

610
00:43:33,990 --> 00:43:35,990
Ta.

611
00:43:36,220 --> 00:43:39,710
See! I told you to borrow the flashlight,
and you didn't do it. Were you just acting cool?

612
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:42,130
I didn't act cool.
It's you!

613
00:43:42,130 --> 00:43:43,230
F*ck.

614
00:43:43,230 --> 00:43:45,710
Kept asking me to play games,
I forgot about the flashlight see.

615
00:43:45,710 --> 00:43:47,710
If Eiw finds out that I didn't bring it,
he'll scold at me again.

616
00:43:47,870 --> 00:43:49,370
Just let him scold.

617
00:43:49,370 --> 00:43:50,740
It's so dark.

618
00:43:50,740 --> 00:43:52,980
- No I don't want to.
- Stop complaining.

619
00:43:52,980 --> 00:43:54,980
- Go.
- Cake.

620
00:43:55,340 --> 00:43:57,190
Just lead me. Go.

621
00:43:57,190 --> 00:43:58,740
Hurry up.
I have to pee.

622
00:43:58,740 --> 00:44:00,740
Hey Cake!.
Cake!

623
00:44:00,740 --> 00:44:02,510
Cake.

624
00:44:02,510 --> 00:44:05,250
- What!?
- Ghost. A ghost is grabbing my leg.

625
00:44:05,250 --> 00:44:07,250
Ghost.
A ghost is grabbing my leg.

626
00:44:07,250 --> 00:44:08,970
Cake!

627
00:44:09,180 --> 00:44:11,280
It's not  the damn ghost.
It's a branch.

628
00:44:11,840 --> 00:44:13,280
Go. I have to pee.

629
00:44:14,620 --> 00:44:16,410
- Cake
- Huh?

630
00:44:17,140 --> 00:44:18,780
No need anymore.

631
00:44:24,750 --> 00:44:26,460
That is gross.

632
00:44:27,830 --> 00:44:29,630
I have to pee too.

633
00:44:29,870 --> 00:44:31,410
You don't need to use it
anymore right?

634
00:44:31,410 --> 00:44:32,660
Nope.

635
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:33,820
If not then,
I'm leaving.

636
00:44:33,820 --> 00:44:35,820
Cake!
