1
00:01:23,740 --> 00:01:24,970
See-Eiw.

2
00:01:24,970 --> 00:01:26,800
Oh you're awake?

3
00:01:26,800 --> 00:01:28,570
Um, what are you doing?

4
00:01:28,570 --> 00:01:30,140
I'm about to fry some eggs.

5
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:32,140
You can go back sleep in a little more.

6
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,810
- Err...
- Pu-khao. You can just call me Pu.

7
00:01:35,810 --> 00:01:37,810
Oh okay Pu.

8
00:01:37,810 --> 00:01:39,810
You can go back to sleep.
Just an afternoon class right?

9
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,490
Yeah...but I am already awake.

10
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:45,490
Do you need some help with anything?

11
00:01:48,250 --> 00:01:50,490
Oh over there.

12
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:53,690
You can help me toast the breads.

13
00:01:53,690 --> 00:01:55,690
Sure. Okay.

14
00:01:56,220 --> 00:01:58,130
I will go ahead and toast them.

15
00:01:58,130 --> 00:02:01,890
You can just toast for yourself.
For the others, just leave it.

16
00:02:01,890 --> 00:02:04,530
They can do it by themselves
when they're awake, so it'd be warmer.

17
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:06,960
Sure.
Do you want some too?

18
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,160
Oh sure.
I can have one.

19
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:11,160
- Yes sir.
- Thank you.

20
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:22,120
You have known Cake for so long, haven't you?

21
00:02:22,960 --> 00:02:26,380
Yeah since we were born.
Pretty much.

22
00:02:27,010 --> 00:02:29,530
- What do you mean?
- Well...

23
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:34,770
We live next to each other's doors
when we were kids.

24
00:02:34,770 --> 00:02:36,280
Grew up together,

25
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,280
and went to the same school.

26
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:40,890
I always...

27
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,890
have Cake by my side.

28
00:02:44,380 --> 00:02:46,040
Wow...

29
00:02:46,040 --> 00:02:47,160
that's awesome.

30
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:49,920
That means you guys
are super close right? Like...

31
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,920
you can talk to each other
about everything?

32
00:02:52,460 --> 00:02:54,200
Yeah.

33
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:56,200
We are super close.

34
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,620
Do you have an afternoon class?

35
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,810
Yeah you too?

36
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:02,810
Yes. Me too.

37
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,490
Are you alright over there?

38
00:03:08,490 --> 00:03:10,490
If you cannot find anything,
just let me know.

39
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,490
Sure.

40
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:17,360
Ow!

41
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:22,680
- Are yo okay, Eiw?
- I'm fine.

42
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:24,680
Does it hurt?
Oil splatter?

43
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,680
I'm okay.
I'm fine. Just a little burn.

44
00:03:32,370 --> 00:03:34,810
- That's my boyfriend.
- Damn. I didn't do anything.

45
00:03:34,810 --> 00:03:36,970
I just saw him got splattered by the oil.

46
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,970
and I was a bit panic.

47
00:03:39,160 --> 00:03:41,120
Jealous much?

48
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,850
I'm pretty good and boxing too,
in case you didn't know.

49
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:47,260
I know. I know.

50
00:03:47,260 --> 00:03:50,500
Don't dare to touch him anymore.
I'm gonna go back to the toaster.

51
00:03:50,500 --> 00:03:52,500
Yeah toast one for me too.

52
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:55,290
Now asking me a favor too.

53
00:03:55,290 --> 00:03:57,290
Stop complaining.

54
00:03:58,340 --> 00:04:00,100
One toast, right?

55
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
Yeah.

56
00:04:02,330 --> 00:04:04,200
Did it hurt?

57
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:06,200
Just a little burn. I'm fine, Cake.

58
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,770
See! You're not careful.

59
00:04:10,770 --> 00:04:12,460
Luckily nothing major.

60
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,460
Go rinse with cool water
and put some cream on.

61
00:04:15,490 --> 00:04:16,970
I'll handle the eggs from here.

62
00:04:16,970 --> 00:04:19,459
You know about basic medical aid too?

63
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:22,650
Are you mocking me?

64
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,650
Go put some cream on.
I'll fry the eggs for you.

65
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:27,570
- Go!.
- I'm fine. I'll do the eggs myself.

66
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,570
- Are you sure?
- Um.

67
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,260
What?

68
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:36,500
I was kinda enjoying the moment.

69
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,170
Continue your thing.

70
00:04:38,170 --> 00:04:40,170
- One toast.
- Yeah.

71
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:42,170
Yes sir.

72
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:43,650
- Go.
- Pu: I'll give you two.

73
00:04:43,650 --> 00:04:45,450
Go help Pu with the toasts.

74
00:04:45,450 --> 00:04:47,450
- I'll fry these for you.
- Fine.

75
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:52,860
- You're sure you can fry?
- I'm sure.

76
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:54,860
Keep a distance from him too.

77
00:04:56,860 --> 00:05:01,170
He can be close to me.
I don't have Rabies.

78
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:06,850
- I just wanna be protective over my guy.
- Right. I know.

79
00:05:06,850 --> 00:05:08,700
Good.

80
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:10,700
- Very good.
- Like this?

81
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:14,930
- There’re only a few people here.
- Yeah.

82
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:16,660
That’s good.

83
00:06:16,660 --> 00:06:18,660
It’s good that you come early too sometimes.

84
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,660
Cake.

85
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:22,810
It’s fine. There’s no body here.

86
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:27,280
- That’s not the point.
- We’ve arrived.

87
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,420
Yeah we are.

88
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:30,420
I don’t know why do you have to walk me here.

89
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:33,520
Why not? I’d would love to.

90
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:35,520
I cannot walk you?

91
00:06:36,100 --> 00:06:37,640
You can.

92
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,640
But you might be late for your class.

93
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,640
You could be late and what am I gonna do?

94
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:43,640
I won’t

95
00:06:44,010 --> 00:06:45,640
I already posted about us on Facebook.

96
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,280
I should let people at uni know too.

97
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:50,810
So no one will try to flirt with you.

98
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:52,810
There’s nobody gonna do that, Cake.
You’re nuts.

99
00:06:53,170 --> 00:06:54,810
Who’d dare to do?

100
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,370
Many people would.

101
00:06:57,370 --> 00:06:59,370
Nonsense.

102
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:02,900
Go go to class Cake. I will go up to my class now.

103
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,940
Go. See you.

104
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,940
I love you.

105
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:14,980
Please go. You should go already.

106
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:18,010
Why? I just wanna let you know that I love you.

107
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:21,730
I know.

108
00:07:21,730 --> 00:07:23,730
I said I love you.

109
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,060
I know. I love you too.

110
00:07:28,060 --> 00:07:30,060
What? I can’t hear you.

111
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:33,540
Please don’t tease me.

112
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:35,970
- Cake.
- Love you.

113
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:39,240
- I know. Ok ok.
- Love love love.

114
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:41,240
I love you too.

115
00:07:41,240 --> 00:07:43,240
Ok you should really go to class now.
See you at noon.

116
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:45,240
See you at noon.
I’ll come have lunch with you.

117
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:46,520
- Okay.
- Have fun.

118
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:48,520
Don’t be late. Bye bye.

119
00:07:49,460 --> 00:07:51,040
- Bye.
- Bye.

120
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:55,770
I love you.

121
00:08:02,850 --> 00:08:04,680
I’m hurt.

122
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:06,680
Get over it.

123
00:08:09,480 --> 00:08:11,020
The meaning of accounting…

124
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:13,900
defined by the Federation of Accounting Professions.

125
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:15,900
under The Royal Pratonage of His Majesty the King.

126
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:19,610
They define accounting as…

127
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:23,090
- You can’t stop smiling huh Eiw?
- Huh?

128
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:25,090
What?

129
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,410
So irritating when someone is in love.

130
00:08:30,410 --> 00:08:32,409
What are you talking about?

131
00:08:32,409 --> 00:08:34,100
Just pay attention to the class.

132
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,100
Fine.

133
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:38,100
Eiw, can I borrow your blue hi-lighter?

134
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:40,100
But just give me the whole pencil case.

135
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:43,280
cause you might give me the wrong color.

136
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,280
How could I give you the wrong color?

137
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,660
I want the blue hi-lighter but...

138
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:53,060
right now you probably see everything in a pink color.

139
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:57,260
Just have whatever.

140
00:08:57,260 --> 00:08:58,580
You're such a teaser.

141
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,580
Back to study.

142
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:09,650
I'm leaving.
Where're you going next?

143
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:13,010
Why so hurry?
Are you meeting someone?

144
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:15,010
Hmm no.

145
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:17,010
It's totally normal.

146
00:09:18,170 --> 00:09:19,440
Stop trying to tease me.

147
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:21,440
I'm not meeting anyone.

148
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:23,440
Nothing.
I was just asking.

149
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:25,440
I will go now.

150
00:09:26,460 --> 00:09:30,690
There's probably someone
waiting for you out front for sure.

151
00:09:30,690 --> 00:09:35,280
Stop it Noey!
I'm gonna na for real

152
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:37,280
Get home safely
and where are you going?

153
00:09:37,280 --> 00:09:38,600
I'm not telling you.

154
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:40,600
Fine. Get home safely.
See you tomorrow.

155
00:09:43,940 --> 00:09:47,890
Don't trip over something
cause you're in such a hurry.

156
00:10:17,530 --> 00:10:19,370
- Cake!
- Hey!

157
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,370
What did you just do?

158
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:23,370
I didn't expect that.

159
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:27,810
You were immersed in the animation.

160
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:30,940
You almost got kissed on the cheek
in front of the whole uni.

161
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:32,360
Please behave.

162
00:10:32,360 --> 00:10:34,360
How could you squeeze me like that?

163
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:36,360
You finished early?

164
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:39,360
Are you hungry?
Wanna go eat something?

165
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,360
A bit.

166
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,560
Do you wanna stop by to eat or
just eat at my place?

167
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:47,580
No more your place.

168
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:49,580
I'm going home today.

169
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:51,580
I've been with you all week already.

170
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:53,580
We stick together too much already.

171
00:10:54,490 --> 00:10:56,140
Please stick.

172
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,090
So you can be with me everywhere.

173
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:03,740
I'm a human Mr.Dessert,
not your personal bag.

174
00:11:06,520 --> 00:11:09,860
You never talked like this before.

175
00:11:09,860 --> 00:11:11,860
You're sick of me right?

176
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:17,300
I wanna have...

177
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,300
the Korean pork place
across from your dorm.

178
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:24,040
That one again?
Aren't you bored of it?

179
00:11:24,040 --> 00:11:25,810
No not really.

180
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,810
Whenever I like something,

181
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:29,810
I can always have it.
Never get bored of it.

182
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:31,810
I can even have it all my life.

183
00:11:33,970 --> 00:11:36,490
So if you like me...

184
00:11:36,490 --> 00:11:38,490
that means you'll have me all your life right?

185
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,610
What are you talking about?

186
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,060
Is that right?

187
00:11:45,060 --> 00:11:47,060
Cake!

188
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:49,800
You're so cute.

189
00:11:50,330 --> 00:11:51,800
Stop talking...

190
00:11:51,800 --> 00:11:53,480
Let's go!

191
00:11:53,480 --> 00:11:55,480
Come on.

192
00:11:55,480 --> 00:11:57,480
Let's hurry and eat each other.

193
00:11:57,860 --> 00:12:01,240
Cake! What are you talking about?
Stop!

194
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:03,240
You don't wanna eat?

195
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:06,330
Eat what?

196
00:12:06,330 --> 00:12:08,330
The Korean rice.

197
00:12:08,330 --> 00:12:09,620
What were you thinking?

198
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:11,620
Nothing. I meant the rice.

199
00:12:11,620 --> 00:12:13,620
Okay, We'll buy it and eat at my place then.

200
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:15,620
We can watch the show that you like too.

201
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,340
Sure.

202
00:12:17,340 --> 00:12:19,340
Let's go.

203
00:12:22,850 --> 00:12:24,780
Go.

204
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:30,680
Let's go. Get up.

205
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:32,680
Okay fine. I'll stop.

206
00:12:43,050 --> 00:12:45,690
- Is it good?
- Yeah.

207
00:12:45,690 --> 00:12:47,690
Here.

208
00:12:47,860 --> 00:12:50,320
- Here.
- No need.

209
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,600
I believe you that it's good.
How do you eat and make it messy?

210
00:12:52,600 --> 00:12:54,600
Really? Again?

211
00:12:57,640 --> 00:13:00,000
I'm always clumsy.

212
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:02,820
It's gone.

213
00:13:06,940 --> 00:13:10,130
Cake! I want you to help clean, not kiss.

214
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:12,130
Then why did you make such a cute face?

215
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:18,700
You also have some food on your forehead.

216
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,700
Here it's on the root of your hair.

217
00:13:20,840 --> 00:13:22,440
No no.
Let me get it for you.

218
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:24,440
- Where?
- Here this side.

219
00:13:30,140 --> 00:13:31,560
- You're trying to get back at me?
- No I'm not.

220
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
- You're trying to get back at me?
- No.

221
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:37,740
Cake!

222
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,740
I'm not gonna let you win.

223
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:44,690
You're not that good.

224
00:13:44,690 --> 00:13:46,690
Catch me. Catch me.

225
00:13:46,690 --> 00:13:48,690
See! You couldn't catch me.

226
00:13:50,690 --> 00:13:53,980
Now I will!
You can't get away now.

227
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:59,400
Your drool is all over my face.

228
00:14:16,690 --> 00:14:19,930
Oh Cake you're awake?

229
00:14:19,930 --> 00:14:21,930
Yeah. What're you doing?

230
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:25,760
I'm packing my stuff.
I'm going home today.

231
00:14:27,140 --> 00:14:29,980
- Going home?
- Yes.

232
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,980
You're still a sleepyhead as always.

233
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,980
Are you hungry, Cake?

234
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:38,930
I went down and bought you some porridge.
It's on the table.

235
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:40,930
Go brush your teeth and have your breakfast.

236
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,930
Did you eat?

237
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:46,700
I did, awhile ago.

238
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:48,700
You're so slow like a sloth.

239
00:14:53,930 --> 00:14:56,120
Are you old?

240
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:58,120
Okay.

241
00:14:59,280 --> 00:15:02,420
I'll go shower and have the breakfast you got me.

242
00:15:02,420 --> 00:15:04,420
Um.

243
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,810
Can I please go spend a night with you today?

244
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:13,040
Don't do that begging eyes to me.

245
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,890
It's not working.

246
00:15:14,890 --> 00:15:16,890
Pretty please.

247
00:15:17,620 --> 00:15:21,920
Cake! It's the weekend.
Why don't you go home too?

248
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,640
Last Saturday,
you were also at my home.

249
00:15:29,090 --> 00:15:32,560
- Come here.
- I might trip!

250
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:34,560
I wanna hug with you.

251
00:15:35,890 --> 00:15:37,850
Don't show me your sweet eyes, Cake!

252
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,850
Last week you were also with me.

253
00:15:40,380 --> 00:15:42,600
Aunty Proud probably misses you already.

254
00:15:42,600 --> 00:15:44,420
Cream also.

255
00:15:44,420 --> 00:15:46,420
You should go back to your home too.

256
00:15:46,420 --> 00:15:48,420
I will next Saturday.

257
00:15:48,420 --> 00:15:50,420
I already called mom and let her know.

258
00:15:50,420 --> 00:15:52,420
For Cream, just forget her.
Let her be.

259
00:15:52,420 --> 00:15:54,420
That's your little sister!

260
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:56,420
- Let's go!
- She's not missing her brother.

261
00:15:56,420 --> 00:15:58,920
Stop dragging on.
Go have your breakfast. It's getting cold.

262
00:15:58,920 --> 00:16:00,920
- Go brush your teeth.
- Let me hug you for a little more.

263
00:16:00,920 --> 00:16:02,920
Hug more.
Tighter.

264
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,440
Cake. That hurts.

265
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:06,620
What if you broke my back?

266
00:16:06,620 --> 00:16:08,620
- Go!
- Okay.

267
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:11,560
Go!

268
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:15,300
You are still slow and sluggish as always.

269
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:17,300
You're a grown man.

270
00:16:20,140 --> 00:16:21,540
Go!

271
00:16:22,080 --> 00:16:24,930
How can I kiss you?
You haven't even brushed your teeth.

272
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:28,570
- Blah blah.
- So nasty.

273
00:16:50,540 --> 00:16:52,890
I will go put my stuff away, say hi to aunty Nate and...

274
00:16:52,890 --> 00:16:54,610
do you wanna go to the canal area?

275
00:16:54,610 --> 00:16:56,340
Do you wanna go!?

276
00:16:56,340 --> 00:16:58,340
Yeah kinda miss it.

277
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,800
Let's go. I miss it too.

278
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,320
Wanna compete on the rock skipping?

279
00:17:03,320 --> 00:17:05,319
Have you ever gotten better?

280
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:08,060
I don't know.
Haven't done it for so long.

281
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:10,329
But my gut is telling me
that I'm definitely improved.

282
00:17:10,329 --> 00:17:13,280
Watch me!
I will make it skip for so many times.

283
00:17:15,520 --> 00:17:17,099
You're full or crap.

284
00:17:17,099 --> 00:17:19,500
Just wait and see.
I can do it this time.

285
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
I'm definitely better than you now.

286
00:17:21,500 --> 00:17:23,500
Looking forward to it.

287
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:27,680
"Mama's Dim Sum"

288
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:30,600
Mom, I'm home.

289
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,600
Hey.

290
00:17:32,800 --> 00:17:36,460
Cake, mom is not home.

291
00:17:36,460 --> 00:17:38,460
Hm where could she have gone?

292
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:40,640
But the shop left open.

293
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,490
Really?
Normally she never left it open if she's not home.

294
00:17:45,490 --> 00:17:47,380
Is she upstairs?

295
00:17:47,490 --> 00:17:49,490
put you stuff here an go check upstairs.

296
00:17:49,660 --> 00:17:51,490
Ok I'll go check upstairs first.

297
00:17:51,890 --> 00:17:53,920
Mom!

298
00:17:57,080 --> 00:17:59,440
Mom, I'm home.

299
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:04,700
Mom! Cake! Cake!

300
00:18:04,700 --> 00:18:06,700
Eiw what's happening!?

301
00:18:09,680 --> 00:18:12,210
- Mom help get her up.
- Relax.

302
00:18:12,210 --> 00:18:13,730
- I'm fine.
- Cake calls...calls...

303
00:18:13,730 --> 00:18:15,730
- Cake listen to me.
- Calls Hom.

304
00:18:15,730 --> 00:18:17,730
- I'll call the ambulance first.
- Mom you'll be okay.

305
00:18:17,730 --> 00:18:21,610
Mom wake up.
Talk to me mom!

306
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:23,610
You have to be okay, mom.

307
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:27,160
Send the ambulance here please.

308
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:29,160
- Female.
- Mom.

309
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,160
Eiw calm down!

310
00:18:33,370 --> 00:18:34,770
Accident - Emergency Room.

311
00:18:37,920 --> 00:18:39,610
Eiw.

312
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:43,420
How is she?

313
00:18:43,420 --> 00:18:45,420
Still haven't come out.

314
00:18:47,420 --> 00:18:50,340
She's been loosing weight a lot.

315
00:18:51,370 --> 00:18:54,000
She's so skinny now.

316
00:18:56,860 --> 00:19:00,000
Relax, Eiw.
She'll be okay.

317
00:19:01,580 --> 00:19:04,240
It's because I haven't been
taking good care of her.

318
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,760
I never know that she's sick.

319
00:19:10,140 --> 00:19:13,500
It's probably I don't have the time for her, right?

320
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:16,740
It's not your fault.

321
00:19:20,170 --> 00:19:22,770
If I had gone home,

322
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:24,770
and taken good care of her more...

323
00:19:25,900 --> 00:19:29,010
or talked to her more...

324
00:19:29,010 --> 00:19:31,010
she wouldn't be like this, would she?

325
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,530
Don't think it that way Eiw.

326
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:40,760
I don't know sis.

327
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,760
I really don't know.

328
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:44,760
I never knew that she's been sick.

329
00:19:46,760 --> 00:19:49,360
- She'll be okay right?
- She'll be fine.

330
00:19:49,360 --> 00:19:51,360
She'll be okay, Eiw.

331
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,520
Trust me.
She'll be fine.

332
00:20:00,140 --> 00:20:02,640
Don't cry.

333
00:20:04,820 --> 00:20:07,660
Don't cry. She'll be okay.

334
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:09,660
It's okay Eiw.

335
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:14,330
She'll come out soon.

336
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:16,330
Don't cry.

337
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
Her diagnosis...

338
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,520
she has a tumor at her liver.

339
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:36,380
But I thought it's not a real cause of her condition...

340
00:20:36,380 --> 00:20:41,800
so I did an x-ray, ultrasound, and biopsy to diagnose some more.

341
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,800
and now we found that...

342
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:46,860
The cancer comes from the lung.

343
00:20:50,000 --> 00:20:53,330
What caused it?

344
00:20:53,330 --> 00:20:56,660
She never showed any symptoms.

345
00:20:56,660 --> 00:21:01,040
She also doesn't smoke.
What is the cause of it?

346
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:03,660
Anyone at home smoke?

347
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,040
Not really.

348
00:21:11,040 --> 00:21:13,040
Me and my brother also don't smoke.

349
00:21:15,260 --> 00:21:16,700
Any other people?

350
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,940
Like your father or any relatives who live with you.

351
00:21:19,940 --> 00:21:21,940
Anyone?

352
00:21:21,940 --> 00:21:23,720
My dad does smoke.

353
00:21:23,720 --> 00:21:27,290
But they've been divorced for so many years.

354
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,900
Is he a heavy smoker?

355
00:21:30,900 --> 00:21:33,130
He is. He smokes everyday.

356
00:21:34,650 --> 00:21:36,260
Here's the thing,

357
00:21:36,260 --> 00:21:39,410
Apart from the direct effect of smoking,

358
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:43,240
there are also second hand smoking,

359
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:45,400
and thirdhand smoking as well

360
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,930
I believe not many people know about this.

361
00:21:49,580 --> 00:21:56,200
Thirdhand smoking is when the pollutants or the residues

362
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,490
from the tobacco

363
00:21:57,490 --> 00:22:01,780
remains on fingernails, skin surface, or even clothes,

364
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:06,680
including all the furnitures in the house as well.

365
00:22:06,680 --> 00:22:11,920
All these residues can be left like that for many years too.

366
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:17,050
From the history of the patient that you just told us,

367
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:19,050
I think...

368
00:22:19,050 --> 00:22:21,050
she is sick

369
00:22:21,050 --> 00:22:23,050
because your dad is a heavy smoker.

370
00:22:23,420 --> 00:22:27,570
and that affects your mother to be contaminated
with a lot of these chemicals

371
00:22:27,570 --> 00:22:29,810
for a long period of time.

372
00:22:29,810 --> 00:22:33,780
and that's been built up in her body.

373
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:35,780
But my dad...

374
00:22:36,090 --> 00:22:38,940
left us for so many year already.

375
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:43,570
But she's been receiving these chemicals for so long.

376
00:22:43,570 --> 00:22:45,570
If she lived with him

377
00:22:45,570 --> 00:22:47,570
for 10-20 years,

378
00:22:47,570 --> 00:22:52,000
she definitely will be affected from it even more.

379
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,000
Even...

380
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,880
the they are no longer together for the last 10 years.

381
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:03,040
and now the cancer has already
spread out to other organs too.

382
00:23:03,040 --> 00:23:05,040
Right now,

383
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:07,760
the result of your mother

384
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:09,760
shows that...

385
00:23:10,800 --> 00:23:14,840
she has an aggressive stage 4 lung cancer.

386
00:23:14,840 --> 00:23:16,840
In other words,

387
00:23:16,840 --> 00:23:18,840
she has the last stage of the cancer.

388
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,980
Err...

389
00:23:30,930 --> 00:23:33,540
and what are we gonna do now?

390
00:23:35,540 --> 00:23:38,460
For the surgery option,

391
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:40,460
it might be tough

392
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:44,380
because we have no idea
whether there are any fascia on the lung or not.

393
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:47,500
It might also

394
00:23:47,500 --> 00:23:50,020
has a many side effects post-surgery

395
00:23:50,020 --> 00:23:53,420
but cause she's pretty old too.

396
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:59,970
Now the cancer has already spread out to the whole body.

397
00:24:00,700 --> 00:24:04,640
If you really want to go for the surgery,

398
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:06,640
we will have to see

399
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,200
whether the medicine will be effective with the cancer.

400
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,200
One more important note,

401
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:15,010
we have to see

402
00:24:15,010 --> 00:24:17,740
whether the patient can take all these or not.

403
00:24:20,780 --> 00:24:22,900
But if you're not going for the surgery,

404
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,540
you can choose to...

405
00:24:25,540 --> 00:24:30,240
go for the palliative care.

406
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,240
focusing

407
00:24:32,820 --> 00:24:35,290
on the patient

408
00:24:35,290 --> 00:24:39,210
trying to make her have the least pain possible.

409
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:45,820
You guys can consult each other first.

410
00:24:45,820 --> 00:24:47,820
and let me know your decision later.

411
00:24:47,820 --> 00:24:49,820
Sure.

412
00:24:49,820 --> 00:24:54,130
Now she's in a very dangerous condition.

413
00:24:54,130 --> 00:24:56,130
I really want you guys

414
00:24:56,130 --> 00:24:58,130
to take good care of her closely.

415
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,410
give her support.

416
00:25:02,410 --> 00:25:04,410
Because for this disease,

417
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:07,900
emotional support is very important.

418
00:26:15,800 --> 00:26:19,180
But she never had any symptoms at all.

419
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:21,180
Even she has a stage 4.

420
00:26:23,450 --> 00:26:25,820
With this stage,

421
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:29,730
it's impossible not to have any symptoms.

422
00:26:30,500 --> 00:26:34,780
So you're saying that she knows all these times,
but she doesn't tell us?

423
00:26:36,330 --> 00:26:41,560
It's totally normal. Old people often do this.
They don't wanna see doctors.

424
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:45,160
so they don't come for further diagnosis and get treatment.

425
00:26:45,160 --> 00:26:47,160
They usually keep it to themselves

426
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:49,160
until the condition gets worse already.

427
00:26:49,450 --> 00:26:51,440
There're many cases like this.

428
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,250
When we finally found out,

429
00:26:54,250 --> 00:26:56,250
sometimes...

430
00:26:56,530 --> 00:26:59,610
doctors cannot also cure it in time.

431
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:34,760
Mom...

432
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:37,420
See-Eiw.

433
00:27:37,420 --> 00:27:39,420
Mom.

434
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,500
Mom how are you doing?
Are you hurt?

435
00:27:49,960 --> 00:27:52,160
Not at all.

436
00:27:52,160 --> 00:27:54,160
I'm fine now.

437
00:27:58,620 --> 00:28:00,620
Do you wanna drink some water?

438
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:14,520
Drink slowly.

439
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:21,890
That's enough, See-Eiw.

440
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,340
Easy.

441
00:28:28,500 --> 00:28:29,800
You're such a crybaby.

442
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:39,340
I love you mom.

443
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:45,610
Are you hungry?
I got you some porridge.

444
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:49,690
I'm not.

445
00:28:49,690 --> 00:28:51,690
I wanna sleep.

446
00:28:55,360 --> 00:28:57,880
Then you go to sleep.

447
00:28:57,880 --> 00:28:59,880
Get a lot of rest,
so you can be better soon.

448
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:05,140
You can do it! You always rock!

449
00:29:07,570 --> 00:29:09,960
Let's go.
et her sleep.

450
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,560
Here's the tissue, mom.

451
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,050
You should drink first.

452
00:30:09,080 --> 00:30:11,080
Slowly.

453
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:15,530
That's enough son.

454
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,040
Oh I'm sorry.

455
00:30:18,040 --> 00:30:20,040
That's fine.

456
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:30,020
Let's have some food. Here.

457
00:30:30,680 --> 00:30:33,600
There'r some apples and oranges that you like too.

458
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:35,600
That's too much.

459
00:30:36,660 --> 00:30:40,700
You won't have the energy if you don't eat.
If you're better, then you can go home.

460
00:30:42,700 --> 00:30:45,600
You must be tired, Eiw.

461
00:30:45,960 --> 00:30:47,600
I'm fine mom.

462
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:49,600
Don't worry.

463
00:30:49,600 --> 00:30:51,600
I'm good.
This is very little.

464
00:30:58,700 --> 00:31:00,860
Let me help you.

465
00:31:02,690 --> 00:31:05,920
Poor thing, have to take care of me.

466
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:10,810
Don't say that.

467
00:31:10,810 --> 00:31:12,810
I'm fine.

468
00:31:13,090 --> 00:31:14,810
This is very little of what I can do.

469
00:31:16,940 --> 00:31:20,490
I just want you to get better, so you can go home.

470
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:23,320
Eat up.

471
00:31:23,320 --> 00:31:25,320
So you'll get better.

472
00:31:26,810 --> 00:31:28,220
I'm here.

473
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:46,330
Is it good?

474
00:31:46,330 --> 00:31:49,570
You need to eat a lot more.

475
00:31:57,010 --> 00:31:58,760
That's good.

476
00:31:59,250 --> 00:32:00,760
Drink some water.

477
00:32:07,490 --> 00:32:09,580
I'm here.

478
00:32:10,200 --> 00:32:13,320
You can go rest Eiw. I will take it from here.

479
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:16,060
Okay.

480
00:32:16,060 --> 00:32:18,060
Go rest.

481
00:32:20,760 --> 00:32:23,700
I will feed you, mom.

482
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:27,610
- You only ate a little.
- I already ate a lot.

483
00:32:27,610 --> 00:32:29,610
That's not enough.

484
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:36,760
Eat more please.

485
00:32:42,530 --> 00:32:45,060
- Hi.
-Hi.

486
00:32:50,460 --> 00:32:52,540
I'm good.

487
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:57,340
- Hello.
- Hello.

488
00:32:57,730 --> 00:33:00,210
- I bought this for you guys.
- Thank you.

489
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:02,210
How are you doing aunty Nate?

490
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,840
I'm better now.

491
00:33:06,250 --> 00:33:08,050
How are you Eiw?

492
00:33:08,050 --> 00:33:10,050
I'm fine.

493
00:33:12,560 --> 00:33:14,560
Where have you guys been?

494
00:33:14,560 --> 00:33:16,560
We went to buy some fruits
and come straight here.

495
00:33:27,370 --> 00:33:28,920
I'll be back.

496
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,920
Are you sleepy?

497
00:33:31,740 --> 00:33:34,100
- I'll adjust the bed for you.
- Sure.

498
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
I'm adjusting it.

499
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:41,250
It's okay Cake. I can do it.

500
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,250
You can wait there.

501
00:34:01,450 --> 00:34:04,090
I need to talk to you.

502
00:34:38,880 --> 00:34:41,170
What is it that you need talk to me?

503
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,840
I'm sorry about that.

504
00:34:49,460 --> 00:34:50,840
About what I said.

505
00:34:52,010 --> 00:34:54,739
Maybe because i was too young.

506
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:04,380
You rejected me because I was in high school still.

507
00:35:07,450 --> 00:35:11,810
But if I graduates, will I still have a chance?

508
00:35:14,490 --> 00:35:18,980
It's been so many years,
you still remember all those?

509
00:35:19,890 --> 00:35:22,240
I already forgot all of it.

510
00:35:24,620 --> 00:35:28,040
If you'd forgotten, why do you have to avoid my eye contact?

511
00:35:31,840 --> 00:35:36,000
I never had anyone after al these times.

512
00:35:39,890 --> 00:35:43,970
I'm waiting until the day I am grown up enough to be with you.

513
00:35:43,970 --> 00:35:45,970
But...

514
00:35:45,970 --> 00:35:47,970
You don't have to say anything.

515
00:35:47,970 --> 00:35:49,970
Just don't reject me this time.

516
00:35:56,720 --> 00:35:58,980
If one day,

517
00:35:58,980 --> 00:36:00,980
you trust me enough,

518
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,610
you can be with me when that time comes.

519
00:36:45,260 --> 00:36:47,940
Then i'l take that as a yes?

520
00:38:17,690 --> 00:38:20,640
Eiw, how is she?

521
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:32,650
Go go to your class.

522
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:38,460
You can come back later.

523
00:38:49,210 --> 00:38:53,570
Take care of her.
I'll be back.

524
00:38:53,570 --> 00:38:55,570
Don't worry, Eiw.

525
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:04,740
Go.

526
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:43,780
See-Eiw.

527
00:40:43,780 --> 00:40:45,780
Yes mom?

528
00:40:47,540 --> 00:40:51,970
I already talked to Ton-Hom and Lhong-Bao last night.

529
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:55,820
I wanna talk to you too.

530
00:40:58,340 --> 00:41:00,980
What is it about that you wanna talk to me?

531
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:06,300
Since you were young,

532
00:41:06,300 --> 00:41:08,300
I have worried about you the most.

533
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:13,240
I'm worried that

534
00:41:13,240 --> 00:41:15,240
you might got bullied,

535
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:20,380
or taken advantage of by other people.

536
00:41:22,380 --> 00:41:25,250
I'm worried that...

537
00:41:25,250 --> 00:41:28,130
you might not get what you'd supposed to get.

538
00:41:29,410 --> 00:41:30,970
Mom...

539
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,500
But lately...

540
00:41:35,450 --> 00:41:37,800
You've grown a lot, See-Eiw.

541
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,640
You rest assure me

542
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,980
that you can take care of yourself.

543
00:41:46,980 --> 00:41:49,660
I never expected

544
00:41:49,660 --> 00:41:51,660
you to be the best

545
00:41:53,120 --> 00:41:56,400
has lots or money or rich

546
00:41:58,840 --> 00:42:02,370
I just want you

547
00:42:02,370 --> 00:42:04,370
to have a good happy life

548
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:08,140
be a good person.

549
00:42:12,170 --> 00:42:16,050
I'm already happy just by being your son.

550
00:42:21,860 --> 00:42:24,520
Having you as my son,

551
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,130
is the best gift I could ever ask for.

552
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:36,180
I am so thankful

553
00:42:36,180 --> 00:42:39,020
since the day you were born and opened your eyes.

554
00:42:45,060 --> 00:42:46,540
Cake.

555
00:42:46,540 --> 00:42:48,540
Yes?

556
00:42:48,540 --> 00:42:50,540
Please take care of See-Eiw for me.

557
00:42:52,410 --> 00:42:54,370
I believe

558
00:42:54,370 --> 00:42:56,370
you guys can take care of each other.

559
00:42:57,820 --> 00:43:00,780
Be a home for one another to come to.

560
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:05,770
Don't leave him.

561
00:43:11,530 --> 00:43:13,580
I'll take care of him.

562
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:17,330
I promise.

563
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:28,900
When I'm no longer here,

564
00:43:31,250 --> 00:43:34,080
you need to take god care of yourself okay?

565
00:43:35,850 --> 00:43:38,600
Just the 3 of you left,

566
00:43:39,640 --> 00:43:41,900
don't fight.

567
00:43:45,640 --> 00:43:47,640
My boy.

568
00:43:56,980 --> 00:43:59,370
You should rest mom.

569
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:13,660
I'm always here.

570
00:45:21,120 --> 00:45:22,580
Eiw.

571
00:45:23,450 --> 00:45:25,770
Are you hungry?

572
00:45:25,770 --> 00:45:27,770
Want me to make you some omelette?

573
00:45:29,770 --> 00:45:32,380
I'm not hungry yet.

574
00:45:33,690 --> 00:45:36,020
You haven't eaten anything today.

575
00:45:36,920 --> 00:45:39,680
You only ate a little during lunch.

576
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:41,680
You've been losing weight.
Did you know that?

577
00:45:47,090 --> 00:45:49,610
I'm fine. I'm not hungry.

578
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,780
I'll go take a shower first.

579
00:46:31,690 --> 00:46:33,580
Eiw.

580
00:46:37,610 --> 00:46:40,200
You don't showering?

581
00:46:40,480 --> 00:46:42,200
Um I'm done.

582
00:46:51,440 --> 00:46:53,560
Are you okay?

583
00:46:58,490 --> 00:47:01,120
Can I hug you please?

584
00:47:20,880 --> 00:47:23,040
Good boy.

585
00:47:26,050 --> 00:47:27,820
It's okay.

586
00:47:29,260 --> 00:47:31,300
It'll be okay.

587
00:47:32,900 --> 00:47:35,140
Your mom will be okay.

588
00:47:40,040 --> 00:47:41,360
It's okay.

589
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:53,460
I'm scared, Cake.

590
00:47:55,980 --> 00:47:57,980
I'm also scared.

591
00:48:09,170 --> 00:48:10,940
It's okay.

592
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:17,300
I don't want her to be in pain.

593
00:48:19,120 --> 00:48:21,900
I want her to be healthy.

594
00:48:23,090 --> 00:48:25,090
Me too.

595
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:34,740
I dot' wanna lose her, Cake.

596
00:48:40,320 --> 00:48:42,200
It's fine.

597
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:47,480
She'll be okay.

598
00:49:02,340 --> 00:49:03,410
Cake.

599
00:49:03,700 --> 00:49:05,140
Hmm?

600
00:49:05,770 --> 00:49:09,020
I want her to stay with me my whole life.

601
00:49:15,180 --> 00:49:17,330
I'll be with you for your whole life instead.

602
00:50:04,940 --> 00:50:08,130
Oh you're awake?

603
00:50:08,130 --> 00:50:10,130
Sine when you're here?

604
00:50:10,130 --> 00:50:12,730
I've been here for around half an hour already.

605
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,680
Ton-Hom is gone?

606
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:17,890
Um I told her to go to work.

607
00:50:17,890 --> 00:50:19,890
She left just now.

608
00:50:19,890 --> 00:50:21,890
I told them.
They don't have to be here all these time.

609
00:50:22,240 --> 00:50:23,890
Why are you guys so stubborn?

610
00:50:24,860 --> 00:50:25,890
Well...

611
00:50:25,890 --> 00:50:28,800
the kids are just worried about their mother.

612
00:50:30,460 --> 00:50:32,740
You too.
Don't have to visit me be with me.

613
00:50:32,740 --> 00:50:36,020
I always sleep and stay awake a bit
back and forth all day.

614
00:50:36,490 --> 00:50:38,660
There's no point of being here.

615
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:41,860
Ugh I'm just free.

616
00:50:41,860 --> 00:50:44,850
Being here with you also keep me occupied.
Not lonely.

617
00:50:45,360 --> 00:50:47,800
You'll be bored instead.

618
00:50:47,800 --> 00:50:51,010
It's like there so much to do in a hospital.

619
00:50:51,380 --> 00:50:52,540
I'm not gonna be bored.

620
00:50:52,540 --> 00:50:54,540
You should get better soon then.

621
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,400
When your'e better,

622
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,400
we can cook

623
00:50:59,400 --> 00:51:02,460
and bake something together.

624
00:51:03,090 --> 00:51:07,620
I already miss your marinated pork recipe.

625
00:51:07,620 --> 00:51:09,620
Wanna have some suki too.

626
00:51:11,620 --> 00:51:15,780
The suki pot is probably turn rusty already.

627
00:51:15,780 --> 00:51:20,340
The kids never come home.

628
00:51:23,370 --> 00:51:26,360
Yeah it's always like that
when they're all grown up.

629
00:51:26,360 --> 00:51:28,360
There'll only

630
00:51:28,360 --> 00:51:30,360
be 2 grandmas left

631
00:51:30,360 --> 00:51:32,360
hanging out and having suki together.

632
00:51:33,460 --> 00:51:36,490
Please get better.

633
00:51:36,490 --> 00:51:38,490
Thanks.

634
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:42,210
Thanks Proud.

635
00:51:42,210 --> 00:51:44,210
Hang in there!

636
00:51:49,460 --> 00:51:51,330
You'll be better soon

637
00:51:54,650 --> 00:51:56,720
and we can go home

638
00:52:01,060 --> 00:52:03,770
We'll have suki together.

639
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:17,050
Why is he here?

640
00:52:17,050 --> 00:52:19,050
I know that I am the cause of all these.

641
00:52:19,640 --> 00:52:24,980
There’s only one thing I asked from you is to stay with me for a long time.

642
00:52:24,980 --> 00:52:26,980
How did you get to my company correctly?

643
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:30,120
You can let me know everything no matter what or how you feel.

644
00:52:30,120 --> 00:52:32,120
Don’t keep it to yourself.

645
00:52:32,680 --> 00:52:39,280
For me, you are the one and the only 1 out of the 100%. The only one that I love.
