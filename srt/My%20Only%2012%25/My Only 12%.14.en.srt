Long Pao, Ton-Hom, See-Eiw.

00:00:44,020 --> 00:00:46,460

00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:49,520

5
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,930
Nate.

6
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,110
You don't have to worry anymore.

7
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,490
Your kids will be fine.

Ms.Natenapa Supsakul.
Born: 13 JAN 1961
Death: 17 OCT 2012.

9
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,960
Sister.

10
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:45,960
Brother.

11
00:02:49,520 --> 00:02:51,890
Do you guys think she can hear us?

12
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,660
Is she gonna be able to see us right now?

13
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:03,240
She is.

14
00:03:05,210 --> 00:03:07,610
She isn't going anywhere.

15
00:03:08,230 --> 00:03:10,210
She's still with you, Eiw.

16
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:11,650
She still with Pao.

17
00:03:11,650 --> 00:03:13,650
She still with me.

18
00:03:13,900 --> 00:03:15,650
She's not going anywhere.

19
00:03:21,850 --> 00:03:24,510
We will always miss her, Eiw.

20
00:03:25,670 --> 00:03:27,570
Listen to me.

21
00:03:29,110 --> 00:03:31,470
She's not going anywhere.

22
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:42,790
Both of you,

23
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:47,820
please don't leave me.

24
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,370
Don't leave me behind again.

25
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:56,420
Stay with me forever.

26
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,390
I don't wanna lose anyone anymore.

27
00:04:06,630 --> 00:04:08,990
We're not going anywhere.

28
00:04:09,670 --> 00:04:11,550
We will be with you.

29
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:13,550
Taking care of you.

30
00:04:13,550 --> 00:04:15,550
We will be your home.

31
00:04:32,070 --> 00:04:34,500
Listen to me, Eiw.

32
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:41,060
Everything shall pass.

33
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:44,540
All three of us...

34
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:46,300
will be okay.

35
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:48,300
Trust me.

36
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:53,730
We'll be fine. We can live even she's gone.

37
00:06:43,850 --> 00:06:44,850
Eiw.

38
00:06:46,190 --> 00:06:49,710
Hey Kung, what are you doing here?

39
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:52,370
I'm here to help. Here.

40
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:55,210
Thank you so much.

41
00:06:57,470 --> 00:06:59,230
Give me that.

42
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:01,230
It's okay. I can carry it.

43
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:02,790
Hey!

44
00:07:03,070 --> 00:07:04,790
Have you been eating?

45
00:07:05,390 --> 00:07:07,820
Seems like you've been losing weight,
you know that right?

46
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,540
I don't really have the appetite.

47
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:14,420
I understand.

48
00:07:14,420 --> 00:07:16,420
But you should try to eat more.

49
00:07:16,700 --> 00:07:18,420
Everyone worries about you.

50
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:22,770
Thank you.

51
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:25,590
Eiw.

52
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:29,530
You still have me, Fee, and Noey.

53
00:07:30,970 --> 00:07:32,810
We are always here to listen.

54
00:07:34,030 --> 00:07:34,950
Okay?

55
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:39,390
Thank you so much.

56
00:07:42,909 --> 00:07:44,340
Let's go.

57
00:07:45,820 --> 00:07:47,250
Are you alright there?

58
00:07:47,250 --> 00:07:49,250
It's not heavy at all.

59
00:07:52,770 --> 00:07:55,390
- You can leave it here.
- Yes sir.

60
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,270
I will go help up there.

61
00:08:04,770 --> 00:08:06,300
Is this all we need?

62
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:08,900
Um there's some more sandalwood at the hall.

63
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:10,900
I will go get it myself.

64
00:08:12,590 --> 00:08:14,590
- Sis.
- Hmm?

65
00:08:14,590 --> 00:08:16,590
Are you okay, sis?

66
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:19,580
Um.

67
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:23,570
- Take care of the rest for me.
- Sure.

68
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,870
I will be back.

69
00:08:45,110 --> 00:08:48,550
- Do you need my help?
- It's fine. Not that heavy.

70
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,550
You should go.

71
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:52,930
Let me help.

72
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,930
Doesn't matter whether it's heavy or not.

73
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,930
I wanna help.

74
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,150
Thank you.

75
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:35,180
Mom.

76
00:10:36,340 --> 00:10:38,660
Rest in peace, mom.

77
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:43,990
You don't have to worry about us.

78
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,290
You don't have to worry.

79
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:00,060
I'll take care of them for you.

80
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:08,980
Yeah you don't have to worry mom.

81
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:13,570
I will take care of everyone.

82
00:12:20,930 --> 00:12:23,190
Why is he here?

83
00:12:47,550 --> 00:12:49,250
I'm going home,sis.

84
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:52,230
Do you wanna talk to dad first?

85
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:56,420
I don't.

86
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,570
There's nothing to talk.

87
00:13:00,170 --> 00:13:01,570
Eiw.

88
00:13:04,850 --> 00:13:06,910
Why?

89
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:10,850
Why do you wanna talk to him so much?

90
00:13:12,770 --> 00:13:14,750
He left mom!

91
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:20,530
Isn't she die because of him?

92
00:13:22,770 --> 00:13:25,750
If he didn't smoke, mom would still be alive.

93
00:13:36,990 --> 00:13:38,290
Eiw.

94
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,710
But he's still our dad.

95
00:13:47,230 --> 00:13:49,230
What kind of dad?

96
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:52,740
He never come back to us.

97
00:13:58,690 --> 00:14:00,990
You still call him dad?

98
00:14:06,370 --> 00:14:07,590
Eiw...

99
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,540
Cake.

100
00:14:12,570 --> 00:14:15,020
Could you take Eiw home?

101
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:17,540
I will handle some stuff here with Hom first.

102
00:14:18,550 --> 00:14:19,850
Sure bro.

103
00:14:23,450 --> 00:14:25,550
Let's go home with me.

104
00:14:28,570 --> 00:14:30,380
See you at home. Eiw.

105
00:14:30,930 --> 00:14:32,380
Yes.

106
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,910
I'll follow you in a bit.

107
00:14:55,060 --> 00:14:57,030
Eat something.

108
00:15:11,140 --> 00:15:12,310
Eat something.

109
00:15:37,310 --> 00:15:39,850
- I'll handle it. You can go help Eiw.
- Sure.

110
00:15:40,790 --> 00:15:42,940
Here, let me help.

111
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,170
thank you, Cake.

112
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,190
Eiw.

113
00:15:56,990 --> 00:16:01,580
Me and Pao will go pack some of mom's stuff in her room.

114
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,580
Do you wanna come help?

115
00:16:05,330 --> 00:16:07,010
Pack what stuff?

116
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:11,150
Kinda put it away and make the room neat.

117
00:16:11,260 --> 00:16:14,420
put all important stuff in the box,

118
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:17,530
and put all the documents in the folder.

119
00:16:19,770 --> 00:16:21,010
Sure sis.

120
00:16:22,420 --> 00:16:23,890
I'll go help you.

121
00:16:23,890 --> 00:16:25,890
I wanna help her.

122
00:16:29,220 --> 00:16:31,230
Shall we go?

123
00:16:32,260 --> 00:16:33,230
Let's go.

124
00:17:59,090 --> 00:18:00,610
Sis.

125
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,540
It's medicine.

126
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:10,030
Medicines.

127
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:14,180
There are lots of medicines.

128
00:18:22,090 --> 00:18:24,580
Why do we have no idea?

129
00:18:29,370 --> 00:18:31,770
She must have been exhausted.

130
00:18:43,110 --> 00:18:44,110
Eiw.

131
00:18:45,770 --> 00:18:47,220
Cake.

132
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:51,120
I found so many medicines from mom's room.

133
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,050
She was probably...

134
00:18:58,090 --> 00:19:00,100
So painful.

135
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:03,990
She was probably coughing a lot.

136
00:19:07,130 --> 00:19:09,930
She knew for so long

137
00:19:10,940 --> 00:19:13,420
but she never told us.

138
00:19:15,830 --> 00:19:17,710
When I was sick,

139
00:19:18,710 --> 00:19:21,510
she still took care of me.

140
00:19:22,900 --> 00:19:24,990
And why...

141
00:19:24,990 --> 00:19:28,010
did I have no idea that she was sick.

142
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:34,930
Why did I leave her to fight on her own?

143
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:36,930
It's okay.

144
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:44,700
She rests in peace now.

145
00:19:47,020 --> 00:19:48,790
She's not in pain anymore.

146
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:38,530
Why sis?

147
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:21,550
Don't cry, Eiw.

148
00:21:26,830 --> 00:21:28,890
Go. Go get some rest.

149
00:21:28,890 --> 00:21:31,540
Go. Stop crying.

150
00:21:42,770 --> 00:21:43,770
Cake.

151
00:21:45,530 --> 00:21:46,860
Yeah?

152
00:21:51,260 --> 00:21:53,470
Take care of him for me.

153
00:21:54,190 --> 00:21:55,650
Sure.

154
00:21:55,650 --> 00:21:58,380
Don't worry. He will under my care.

155
00:22:00,650 --> 00:22:03,090
About my dad,

156
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:05,090
do you feel the same way as Eiw?

157
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:11,130
I don't know.

158
00:22:17,770 --> 00:22:20,050
I'm actually angry with him too.

159
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:23,100
Because he himself...

160
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:25,430
is really the cause why my mom is gone.

161
00:22:27,780 --> 00:22:29,210
But I think...

162
00:22:29,940 --> 00:22:32,420
there's no point of of holding the grudge.

163
00:22:34,310 --> 00:22:36,450
Cause right now,

164
00:22:36,450 --> 00:22:38,450
she's no longer here.

165
00:22:50,060 --> 00:22:51,770
My dad is still my dad.

166
00:22:53,490 --> 00:22:55,050
He is still my father.

167
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:57,580
Hom's father.

168
00:23:00,220 --> 00:23:01,630
and also Eiw's.

169
00:23:04,290 --> 00:23:06,290
I do understand.

170
00:23:07,430 --> 00:23:08,990
I don't expect

171
00:23:08,990 --> 00:23:11,530
Eiw to talk to him like nothing happened.

172
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:15,270
For me,

173
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:19,020
I don't expect to consider our father as a family.

174
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:25,170
I just don't want him keep being angry

175
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:27,170
and hold onto the hatred.

176
00:23:30,220 --> 00:23:31,900
If my mother knew,

177
00:23:32,550 --> 00:23:35,130
she wouldn't be happy if he's like this.

178
00:23:37,370 --> 00:23:38,870
Well...

179
00:23:38,870 --> 00:23:40,870
I will try to talk to him for you about this.

180
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:54,130
Please take care of him, Cake.

181
00:23:55,890 --> 00:23:58,110
Me and Hom tried to convince him already.

182
00:24:00,630 --> 00:24:02,310
If it's not you,

183
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:06,790
I don't know who else I could ask to help.

184
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:12,110
I will try, bro.

185
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:16,110
Thank you for loving Eiw.

186
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:21,940
I will take care of him in the best possible I could.

187
00:24:21,940 --> 00:24:23,940
I promise.

188
00:25:04,250 --> 00:25:06,060
Where were you, Cake?

189
00:25:08,790 --> 00:25:10,630
I was talking to Pao.

190
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:16,010
Are you sleepy?

191
00:25:17,870 --> 00:25:20,090
No, I'm not.

192
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:29,930
Can we talk for a bit?

193
00:25:30,690 --> 00:25:31,930
No...

194
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,910
...if you wanna talk about that.

195
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,910
I'm not gonna talk.

196
00:25:42,610 --> 00:25:43,910
Please talk to me.

197
00:25:43,910 --> 00:25:45,170
Please.

198
00:25:45,170 --> 00:25:47,170
No I won't.

199
00:25:47,170 --> 00:25:48,790
Please.

200
00:25:48,790 --> 00:25:50,790
I won't.

201
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,410
Please.

202
00:25:52,410 --> 00:25:53,820
No.

203
00:25:53,820 --> 00:25:55,010
Please my sweet boy.

204
00:25:55,010 --> 00:25:57,010
No.

205
00:26:02,420 --> 00:26:03,420
Please.

206
00:26:04,100 --> 00:26:05,420
Please.

207
00:26:08,620 --> 00:26:09,650
Please.

208
00:26:12,730 --> 00:26:15,370
What do you wanna talk about?

209
00:26:15,370 --> 00:26:17,370
I'll just listen.

210
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:24,810
- Can you stop being angry with your father?
- No I can't.

211
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:27,630
Don't just answer right away.

212
00:26:27,630 --> 00:26:29,630
I just can't.

213
00:26:33,510 --> 00:26:35,580
You don't have to love him the same.

214
00:26:36,110 --> 00:26:38,030
But just don't be angry with him anymore.

215
00:26:48,630 --> 00:26:50,670
"Mama Dim Sum"

216
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,570
Did you know...

217
00:26:58,540 --> 00:27:00,330
since I was young

218
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,820
all I remember...

219
00:27:06,270 --> 00:27:08,930
was me asking my father to quit smoking.

220
00:27:13,470 --> 00:27:15,550
On Father's Day,

221
00:27:17,550 --> 00:27:19,710
I made a card...

222
00:27:19,710 --> 00:27:21,710
and asked him to quit smoking.

223
00:27:23,790 --> 00:27:26,030
On my birthday,

224
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:32,030
I also asked him that.

225
00:27:36,670 --> 00:27:38,540
I let him know that I love him

226
00:27:39,070 --> 00:27:40,540
worry about him

227
00:27:50,090 --> 00:27:52,700
but he has never actually done it.

228
00:27:54,030 --> 00:27:56,550
I tried every way.

229
00:27:57,540 --> 00:28:00,650
because I was afraid that he could die from smoking.

230
00:28:02,050 --> 00:28:04,020
You know it, Cake.

231
00:28:06,020 --> 00:28:08,790
That cigarette is dangerous.

232
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:15,530
But he couldn't do it for me.

233
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,050
I always tell everyone.

234
00:28:23,810 --> 00:28:27,100
to stay way whenever he smokes.

235
00:28:31,060 --> 00:28:33,190
But I never knew,

236
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:40,060
that third hand smoking is a thing.

237
00:28:42,690 --> 00:28:46,290
If I knew better, mom would still be here, right?

238
00:28:50,410 --> 00:28:51,860
It's not your fault, Eiw.

239
00:28:55,890 --> 00:28:57,690
She is resting in peace now.

240
00:28:59,810 --> 00:29:03,610
The more you blame yourself, the more hurtful I feel.

241
00:29:05,230 --> 00:29:07,580
Your siblings also feel hurtful.

242
00:29:09,970 --> 00:29:14,500
And if your mom saw this, don't you think she's gonna feel hurtful too?

243
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:27,270
I'm sorry.

244
00:29:29,270 --> 00:29:31,580
For so many times,
I also questioned myself that

245
00:29:32,820 --> 00:29:36,030
'why does mom has to go back and talk to dad?'

246
00:29:39,100 --> 00:29:41,530
Am I a bad person?

247
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:43,530
Not at all.

248
00:29:46,350 --> 00:29:48,350
It's okay.

249
00:29:50,350 --> 00:29:52,390
Parents are also humans.

250
00:29:53,140 --> 00:29:54,990
They can be wrong.

251
00:29:55,530 --> 00:29:57,550
Can make mistakes.

252
00:29:58,410 --> 00:30:00,390
When they do something wrong,

253
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:02,940
it might make us mad or feel bad,

254
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:04,940
It's totally normal.

255
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:09,420
It's probably the same with us, when we do something wrong.

256
00:30:11,420 --> 00:30:13,570
Parents might be mad at us, but they never hate us.

257
00:30:16,370 --> 00:30:18,650
Do you hate your father, See-Eiw?

258
00:30:24,420 --> 00:30:25,860
Do you hate him?

259
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:40,530
Then stop being angry with him.

260
00:30:43,330 --> 00:30:45,550
Whatever has passed, you should let it go.

261
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,810
Talk to him too.

262
00:30:52,770 --> 00:30:55,210
You don't have to talk a lot or meet him often.

263
00:30:56,340 --> 00:30:59,050
Don't part from each other
with such bad feelings like this.

264
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,880
Don't you agree, sweet boy?

265
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:07,730
Aren't you gonna feel better?

266
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,420
Even if mom's not around anymore,

267
00:31:11,710 --> 00:31:13,570
you still have your father.

268
00:31:29,550 --> 00:31:31,590
You should go talk to him tomorrow.

269
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,130
Please?

270
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,860
Thank you.

271
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:59,590
I will leave you to talk to him first.

272
00:32:04,570 --> 00:32:06,170
So...

273
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:08,660
We will leave now then.

274
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:10,660
Good bye, dad.

275
00:32:12,860 --> 00:32:15,550
We'll be waiting in the car.

276
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,530
Follow us to the car when you're done.

277
00:32:20,230 --> 00:32:21,530
Sure.

278
00:32:22,450 --> 00:32:23,530
Let's go.

279
00:32:29,970 --> 00:32:31,750
I'll go wait over there.

280
00:32:34,450 --> 00:32:36,530
Good bye sir.

281
00:33:01,330 --> 00:33:03,510
I'm sorry.

282
00:33:06,510 --> 00:33:09,510
I know all about it now.

283
00:33:11,250 --> 00:33:14,850
I know that I am the reason for all these to happened.

284
00:33:17,310 --> 00:33:19,070
I can't do anything,

285
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:21,070
if you're gonna be mad and hate me.

286
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:27,570
If I could exchange my life with hers, I would.

287
00:33:33,150 --> 00:33:35,610
I didn't think that way, dad.

288
00:33:42,550 --> 00:33:45,450
Even I was really mad at you,

289
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:52,070
but I never wanted you to die instead of her.

290
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:02,400
Do you regret?

291
00:34:02,410 --> 00:34:04,410
Having me as your father?

292
00:34:09,969 --> 00:34:11,969
Since I was young,

293
00:34:14,489 --> 00:34:17,210
I never asked anything from you,

294
00:34:19,989 --> 00:34:22,449
never asked for any toys,

295
00:34:24,989 --> 00:34:28,510
or any luxurious stuff.

296
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:31,610
Don't cry son.

297
00:34:38,250 --> 00:34:41,230
There's only one thing I've always asked you...

298
00:34:47,310 --> 00:34:49,170
just one thing.

299
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:52,929
I asked for it every festivals

300
00:34:54,389 --> 00:34:56,989
every holidays,

301
00:34:57,790 --> 00:35:00,130
ever special occasions,

302
00:35:02,710 --> 00:35:05,230
to stop smoking.

303
00:35:11,850 --> 00:35:15,430
I asked you to love yourself.

304
00:35:15,430 --> 00:35:18,270
To take care of your own health

305
00:35:21,030 --> 00:35:24,050
to stay with me forever.

306
00:35:32,450 --> 00:35:35,670
But you've never done that for me.

307
00:35:37,330 --> 00:35:39,570
Did you know...

308
00:35:39,570 --> 00:35:41,570
I asked myself

309
00:35:41,570 --> 00:35:43,870
every time...

310
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:47,230
why haven't you tried to do it for me?

311
00:35:48,590 --> 00:35:51,190
Is it because you never loved me?

312
00:35:54,390 --> 00:35:57,510
I never...dad.

313
00:35:57,510 --> 00:36:00,530
Never asked you to have things like other fathers

314
00:36:00,530 --> 00:36:02,530
or be better than anyone.

315
00:36:04,530 --> 00:36:07,750
I just want you to love yourself.

316
00:36:07,750 --> 00:36:09,750
Love mom.

317
00:36:09,750 --> 00:36:11,750
Ton-Hom.

318
00:36:11,750 --> 00:36:13,750
Long Pao.

319
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:19,070
and love me enough to quit that useless cigarette.

320
00:36:26,350 --> 00:36:29,770
But you've never actually done it.

321
00:36:33,430 --> 00:36:36,230
You did not only left me,

322
00:36:37,670 --> 00:36:41,230
but you take mom away fro me too.

323
00:36:43,830 --> 00:36:47,230
If I have to say I'm not sad,

324
00:36:47,830 --> 00:36:50,390
then that would be a lie.

325
00:36:56,810 --> 00:36:59,250
I'm sorry.

326
00:37:00,530 --> 00:37:02,670
I'm the worst father.

327
00:37:06,190 --> 00:37:08,290
I'm sorry.

328
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:11,850
For never actually do things as I said.

329
00:37:14,650 --> 00:37:17,130
But I love you a lot. Really.

330
00:37:28,890 --> 00:37:30,850
Dad.

331
00:37:31,530 --> 00:37:34,570
I'm not mad at you.

332
00:37:34,570 --> 00:37:36,570
I'm not mad at you anymore.

333
00:37:38,570 --> 00:37:41,150
I never hate you.

334
00:37:42,050 --> 00:37:44,370
Thanks son.

335
00:37:47,650 --> 00:37:50,010
From now on,

336
00:37:51,350 --> 00:37:54,050
if you struggle,

337
00:37:55,470 --> 00:37:57,790
or is there anything that we could help.

338
00:37:57,790 --> 00:37:59,790
you can always tell us.

339
00:38:02,950 --> 00:38:05,650
If I graduate and got a job,

340
00:38:08,330 --> 00:38:11,770
I will give you money every month.

341
00:38:11,770 --> 00:38:13,770
That's fine.

342
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:19,030
I never want any money from you.

343
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:21,030
Just talking to me...

344
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,030
is more than enough.

345
00:38:25,030 --> 00:38:27,850
It's okay dad.

346
00:38:27,850 --> 00:38:29,850
Just take it...

347
00:38:29,850 --> 00:38:31,850
as if I give the money to mom for me.

348
00:38:34,250 --> 00:38:39,030
Please just take it, I'm begging you.

349
00:38:39,030 --> 00:38:41,030
Thanks son.

350
00:38:42,570 --> 00:38:45,150
Thanks for coming back.

351
00:38:46,590 --> 00:38:48,210
Well...

352
00:38:49,550 --> 00:38:51,610
I gotta go now.

353
00:38:51,610 --> 00:38:53,610
Pao and Hom are waiting.

354
00:38:55,030 --> 00:38:56,970
I'm gotta go.

355
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,990
Good bye.

356
00:39:04,590 --> 00:39:06,470
See-Eiw.

357
00:39:09,090 --> 00:39:11,150
Can I hug you for once?

358
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:38,370
Wow you've been growing a lot!

359
00:39:38,370 --> 00:39:40,370
So heavy.

360
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:42,370
Catch me. Catch me.

361
00:39:44,450 --> 00:39:48,870
Gotcha! I catched you.

362
00:39:48,870 --> 00:39:52,330
Dad, you are my hero.

363
00:39:52,330 --> 00:39:53,910
Wow!

364
00:39:53,910 --> 00:39:55,910
Are you gonna say this still when you're grown up?

365
00:40:37,350 --> 00:40:39,190
See you tomorrow.

366
00:40:42,970 --> 00:40:44,750
Hey!

367
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,310
How do you know where's my company?

368
00:40:47,310 --> 00:40:49,310
Am pretty good huh?

369
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,230
What are you doing here?

370
00:40:53,950 --> 00:40:55,950
I wanna talk to you about something.

371
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,990
What is it that you wanna talk?

372
00:41:07,310 --> 00:41:08,990
Why do you have to come all the way here?

373
00:41:11,860 --> 00:41:13,180
You.

374
00:41:15,180 --> 00:41:16,710
I'm a grown up now.

375
00:41:16,710 --> 00:41:18,710
In university already.

376
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,320
Even that's the case,

377
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,320
I still can't live up to your standard.

378
00:41:24,180 --> 00:41:25,320
When I was in high school,

379
00:41:26,180 --> 00:41:27,330
you were in uni.

380
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:30,220
When I'm in uni,

381
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:32,220
you're working already.

382
00:41:35,200 --> 00:41:36,330
I have no idea...

383
00:41:36,330 --> 00:41:38,330
what it means to be a grown up to you.

384
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:42,280
Bur for me,

385
00:41:43,010 --> 00:41:44,280
I've been ready to take care of you

386
00:41:44,280 --> 00:41:46,280
and be someone you can rely on for so long.

387
00:41:51,090 --> 00:41:52,940
What do you think or how do you feel

388
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:54,940
you can just tell me.

389
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,150
Don't keep it to yourself.

390
00:42:09,770 --> 00:42:11,770
You're not gonna say something to me?

391
00:42:16,970 --> 00:42:18,270
Peak.

392
00:42:25,800 --> 00:42:27,990
you have improved so much at acting.

393
00:42:29,990 --> 00:42:31,800
You..

394
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,990
So...

395
00:42:33,990 --> 00:42:35,990
Is that a yes?

396
00:42:37,430 --> 00:42:38,590
I guess.

397
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:40,590
What do you mean 'I guess'?

398
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:43,180
Yes.

399
00:43:07,450 --> 00:43:11,280
- Hom will be off from work around 5.30-6.00 pm
- If she has not to work over time tho.

400
00:43:11,280 --> 00:43:16,030
- Ok
- We have talked.
- Thank you, Eiw.

401
00:43:16,030 --> 00:43:16,740
Peak.

402
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:18,740
Do you wanna leave?

403
00:43:18,740 --> 00:43:20,740
Sure let's go.

404
00:43:26,690 --> 00:43:28,280
What were you doing?

405
00:43:28,280 --> 00:43:29,290
Nothing.

406
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:32,640
Cake.

407
00:43:34,350 --> 00:43:35,540
Still asleep?

408
00:43:47,040 --> 00:43:50,680
Cake. Cake. Cakeee.

409
00:43:51,110 --> 00:43:53,020
Cake! Wake up!

410
00:43:53,670 --> 00:43:54,870
Mom!

411
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,870
since the day you're gone,

412
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,870
it's been a year already.

413
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:00,870
Everything is still the same.

414
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:03,570
I about to graduate this year,

415
00:44:03,570 --> 00:44:06,490
Cake is gonna be a fourth year student this year.

416
00:44:06,490 --> 00:44:08,490
Just a blink of eye,

417
00:44:08,490 --> 00:44:11,500
we're almost real adults already.

418
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:13,500
- Lots of jam.
- Lots of jam.

419
00:44:13,890 --> 00:44:15,500
- Are you gonna eat?
- I will eat anything.

420
00:44:15,850 --> 00:44:17,500
Because you made it for me.

421
00:44:18,820 --> 00:44:20,090
Actually,

422
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:23,150
I have so many things I wanna tell you.

423
00:44:23,890 --> 00:44:26,060
It's really my last year

424
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:30,410
of being a university student.

425
00:44:30,410 --> 00:44:33,490
Thinking about it make me nervous.

426
00:44:33,490 --> 00:44:36,510
I'm still uncertain with my future, mom.

427
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,420
Why are you smiling, Noey?

428
00:44:41,420 --> 00:44:43,420
What smiling?

429
00:44:43,420 --> 00:44:45,420
Just study.

430
00:44:45,880 --> 00:44:47,780
What am I gonna do?

431
00:44:47,780 --> 00:44:49,780
Where am I gonna work?

432
00:44:49,780 --> 00:44:51,910
It's another time where I wonder,

433
00:44:51,910 --> 00:44:53,910
if you're still here,

434
00:44:53,910 --> 00:44:55,910
I would probably be clingy with you,

435
00:44:55,910 --> 00:44:59,920
complaining about stuff on your lap.

436
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:01,920
- Did you wait for me for so long?
- Not at all.

437
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:04,870
That looks good.

438
00:45:06,080 --> 00:45:08,240
You always have some stuff on hands.

439
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:10,240
- One bite.
- That's fine.

440
00:45:11,480 --> 00:45:12,550
Let's just go.

441
00:45:12,550 --> 00:45:14,080
You eat it.

442
00:45:14,080 --> 00:45:16,080
I bought it for you.

443
00:45:18,510 --> 00:45:19,760
Aaaam here.

444
00:45:19,950 --> 00:45:20,930
Ok ok.

445
00:45:22,820 --> 00:45:23,920
That' good.

446
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,920
I already ate. Your turn.

447
00:45:25,920 --> 00:45:26,770
Big bite.

448
00:45:26,770 --> 00:45:28,770
you used to have the bread

449
00:45:28,770 --> 00:45:30,770
- This is of a bite.
- That big?

450
00:45:31,900 --> 00:45:32,770
How big?

451
00:45:32,770 --> 00:45:34,770
- Like this.
- Come on! Eat.

452
00:45:35,590 --> 00:45:36,770
Please.

453
00:45:39,890 --> 00:45:40,880
Cake!

454
00:45:41,710 --> 00:45:44,780
About Pao and Hom, you don't have to worry about them.

455
00:45:44,780 --> 00:45:46,780
They work so hard.

456
00:45:46,920 --> 00:45:49,040
They've got someone to take care of them as well.

457
00:45:56,460 --> 00:45:57,660
Wow.

458
00:46:04,090 --> 00:46:06,950
Even we don't see each other as often
as we used to like when we were young,

459
00:46:07,610 --> 00:46:10,940
but we still manage to have a meal together every week.

460
00:46:11,930 --> 00:46:13,910
Eat at our home like we always have.

461
00:46:14,750 --> 00:46:17,300
Oh there's one thing that's changed, mom.

462
00:46:17,660 --> 00:46:20,860
We contact dad more often.

463
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,860
- Dad's calling, sis.
- Dad?

464
00:46:22,860 --> 00:46:24,360
Dad is calling, bro.

465
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,630
So...

466
00:46:25,630 --> 00:46:28,130
there's nothing that you have to worry.

467
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:31,720
We live our best lives  like we promised you.

468
00:46:32,110 --> 00:46:34,750
Please watch over us from up there.

469
00:46:34,750 --> 00:46:36,750
I miss you the most.

470
00:46:46,620 --> 00:46:48,580
Hey!

471
00:46:48,580 --> 00:46:50,440
- Eiw!
- Hello, Eiw.
- What's up.

472
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:53,040
- You guys are here!
- Yeah we are.

473
00:46:53,040 --> 00:46:55,040
The famous writer.

474
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:57,040
Really good at mocking people huh.

475
00:46:57,040 --> 00:46:58,610
Congrats, Eiw.

476
00:46:58,610 --> 00:47:00,610
This is from the three of us.

477
00:47:00,610 --> 00:47:03,270
- We really handpicked this specifically for you.
- Thank you.

478
00:47:03,270 --> 00:47:05,270
May your book sells really well.

479
00:47:05,470 --> 00:47:07,270
It already is, isn't it?

480
00:47:07,270 --> 00:47:08,930
These two bought 4-5 books each.

481
00:47:08,930 --> 00:47:10,930
whenever they go to malls, they always buy.

482
00:47:10,930 --> 00:47:13,330
You're acting like you didn't buy.

483
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:15,330
Yeah.

484
00:47:16,540 --> 00:47:18,040
Thank you all so much.

485
00:47:18,720 --> 00:47:20,850
I didn't expect it to sells so well.

486
00:47:21,110 --> 00:47:23,880
If readers like it, that makes me happy already.

487
00:47:24,120 --> 00:47:25,880
I read half of it,

488
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,350
and i was in tears.

489
00:47:27,350 --> 00:47:29,350
I'd dare to say,

490
00:47:29,350 --> 00:47:33,400
that you must have cried while you wrote.

491
00:47:34,250 --> 00:47:36,310
Stop talking.

492
00:47:36,310 --> 00:47:37,520
How do you know?

493
00:47:37,520 --> 00:47:39,520
The content is very touching.

494
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,080
I didn't expect to turn out like that.

495
00:47:43,080 --> 00:47:45,080
I was also confused how did I wrote.

496
00:47:45,380 --> 00:47:48,040
When we finish reading it,
I'll discuss with you about it again.

497
00:47:48,040 --> 00:47:49,010
Sure.

498
00:47:49,010 --> 00:47:54,150
Yeah even we haven't finished it,
we still have so many points to discuss with you.

499
00:47:54,150 --> 00:47:56,150
You two still haven't finished it?

500
00:47:56,150 --> 00:47:57,710
You did?

501
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,000
-
Yeah, finished many books already.
- For real!?

502
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:01,860
What are the names of the book?

503
00:48:01,860 --> 00:48:04,930
The New Eiw.

504
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,730
- The New Eiw.
- That's a good one.

505
00:48:09,660 --> 00:48:10,730
Actually,

506
00:48:10,730 --> 00:48:14,990
How did you come up with the back cover part?
It's so good.

507
00:48:14,990 --> 00:48:16,350
Agree.

508
00:48:16,350 --> 00:48:19,750
- It's really good. It made me cry.
- Right?

509
00:48:19,750 --> 00:48:21,420
What does it say?

510
00:48:21,420 --> 00:48:22,900
The chooser who's never been loved

511
00:48:22,900 --> 00:48:25,120
is not equal to the the lover who got chosen.

512
00:48:27,120 --> 00:48:30,710
Do you wanna become a writer? You should write.

513
00:48:30,710 --> 00:48:32,440
Where's Cake thought?

514
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:34,440
Cake? He'll be here shortly.
He went to pick up Cream.

515
00:48:34,740 --> 00:48:36,440
- At her dorm?
- Yes.

516
00:48:36,440 --> 00:48:38,440
Since she got in uni,

517
00:48:38,440 --> 00:48:40,440
Cake is a bit more protective, isn't he?

518
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:42,440
He should be.

519
00:48:42,440 --> 00:48:44,170
The more she's grown, the more beautiful she's become.

520
00:48:44,170 --> 00:48:46,170
Normally, Pao picks her up every Friday.

521
00:48:46,170 --> 00:48:48,670
But he's been super busy lately. Always do OT.

522
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:51,850
Speaking of this still suprises me.

523
00:48:51,850 --> 00:48:54,540
Pao ended up dating Cream.

524
00:48:54,540 --> 00:48:56,540
- Yeah yeah.
- Me too.

525
00:48:56,730 --> 00:48:58,050
Isn't that a good thing?

526
00:48:58,050 --> 00:49:00,050
2 couples from the same families match each other.

527
00:49:00,380 --> 00:49:03,130
Cake and See-Eiw. Pao and Cream.

528
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:05,130
So cute!

529
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,130
Stop embarrassing me.

530
00:49:07,130 --> 00:49:08,600
There's no matching.

531
00:49:08,600 --> 00:49:10,600
Just one couple and it's not mine.

532
00:49:10,600 --> 00:49:12,600
It's Pao and Cream.

533
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:14,600
Aren't you gonna get married with him?

534
00:49:17,060 --> 00:49:18,970
Ugh...what are you talking about?

535
00:49:18,970 --> 00:49:20,970
Stop talking. That's enough.

536
00:49:20,970 --> 00:49:22,540
How can I get married?

537
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:23,860
Let's talk about something else.

538
00:49:23,860 --> 00:49:24,800
Eat.

539
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,380
Oh Eiw, can you sign the book for me?

540
00:49:27,700 --> 00:49:29,380
Me too.

541
00:49:30,450 --> 00:49:33,250
- Where's the pen?
- Really?

542
00:49:33,250 --> 00:49:35,250
Don't forget your friends when you're all famous.

543
00:49:35,540 --> 00:49:37,250
Huh? What's your name again?

544
00:49:40,330 --> 00:49:41,920
Here.

545
00:49:41,920 --> 00:49:43,920
"The Person Who Cannot Choose"

546
00:49:49,120 --> 00:49:50,220
Cake.

547
00:49:50,960 --> 00:49:51,680
Hmm?

548
00:49:51,680 --> 00:49:53,680
Have you ever heard of this column,

549
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:57,560
the possibility that you could
be successful with your first love.

550
00:49:59,560 --> 00:50:01,330
Never.

551
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,560
I read it

552
00:50:04,560 --> 00:50:06,560
when we were in high school.

553
00:50:06,560 --> 00:50:08,560
I don't remember the details

554
00:50:09,770 --> 00:50:10,920
but they said

555
00:50:10,920 --> 00:50:14,260
The chance that you could be successful

556
00:50:14,260 --> 00:50:16,260
is only 12%.

557
00:50:17,290 --> 00:50:19,180
Why is it so little?

558
00:50:20,260 --> 00:50:22,090
I thought so too.

559
00:50:22,090 --> 00:50:24,090
Too little and that makes me annoyed.

560
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,620
But it sounds believable, don't you think?

561
00:50:27,830 --> 00:50:29,570
Cause people always say

562
00:50:29,570 --> 00:50:31,570
first love usually ended up disappointed.

563
00:50:35,860 --> 00:50:37,930
I heard that a lot too.

564
00:50:41,390 --> 00:50:43,010
But you are my first love, Cake.

565
00:50:47,790 --> 00:50:49,340
Yeah.

566
00:50:51,340 --> 00:50:52,890
So...

567
00:50:52,890 --> 00:50:55,620
I'm 1 of the 12% that annoying?

568
00:50:56,940 --> 00:50:58,490
Do you wanna know why?

569
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:01,190
Why?

570
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:04,010
Because the possibility that you'd be successful with your first love

571
00:51:04,010 --> 00:51:06,010
for once and only...

572
00:51:06,010 --> 00:51:08,010
is not just 12%.

573
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:11,990
- Can I ask you something?
- Huh?

574
00:51:11,990 --> 00:51:13,990
- Can I ask you something?
- No.

575
00:51:14,290 --> 00:51:15,990
Cake!

576
00:51:19,500 --> 00:51:21,550
Cake it's tickling.

577
00:51:23,010 --> 00:51:24,110
I'll make your cheek bruised.

578
00:51:44,770 --> 00:51:46,750
I love you, Cake.

579
00:51:48,230 --> 00:51:49,900
I love you too, Eiw.

580
00:51:51,120 --> 00:51:52,690
A lot.

581
00:51:58,100 --> 00:51:59,900
But there's one thing that I don't know.

582
00:52:00,860 --> 00:52:01,900
Hmm?

583
00:52:03,340 --> 00:52:04,780
For me,

584
00:52:04,780 --> 00:52:06,780
You are the only one out of 100%

585
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:09,420
And it's the only 1% that I will love.

586
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:12,950
I'm hungry now.

587
00:52:13,830 --> 00:52:15,550
Stop it.

588
00:52:16,270 --> 00:52:17,920
You always change the subject
when you blush.

589
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:21,000
No I don't. I just wanna go in side.

590
00:52:21,730 --> 00:52:23,530
Fine. We'll go inside.

591
00:52:23,530 --> 00:52:25,530
But first of all,

592
00:52:25,910 --> 00:52:28,550
let me hug you for one more minute.

593
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:53,250
Yeah where the hell is Cake now?

594
00:52:53,250 --> 00:52:55,090
So damn late.

595
00:52:55,090 --> 00:52:57,090
He said he's almost here.

596
00:52:57,090 --> 00:52:58,820
Almost here as in...

597
00:52:58,820 --> 00:53:00,820
'Just left'

598
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,180
Ugh.

599
00:53:09,560 --> 00:53:10,380
Hey!

600
00:53:10,380 --> 00:53:12,050
You guys...

601
00:53:12,050 --> 00:53:14,050
can I have one?

602
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:16,710
Hey!

603
00:53:16,710 --> 00:53:18,490
Why did you throw it away? That's a lot left.

604
00:53:18,490 --> 00:53:20,490
The whole pack.

605
00:53:20,490 --> 00:53:22,490
I'm gonna quit.

606
00:53:22,490 --> 00:53:24,490
You just realized that?

607
00:53:26,100 --> 00:53:27,560
You showed up out of no where!

608
00:53:28,450 --> 00:53:29,560
Why? You got a problem?

609
00:53:30,560 --> 00:53:31,560
Let's go.

610
00:53:31,560 --> 00:53:32,750
I'm hungry. Let's eat.

611
00:53:32,750 --> 00:53:34,750
You came late but still dare to complain.

612
00:53:34,750 --> 00:53:36,750
I haven't eaten anything since this morning.

613
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:39,690
You're the one who complains.
Don't run away. Come here.

614
00:53:39,690 --> 00:53:41,690
Get up.

615
00:53:41,690 --> 00:53:43,690
Hey Palm! There's shit on your ears.

616
00:53:44,630 --> 00:53:46,700
- Wait for me!
- Palm! Come on!

617
00:53:50,680 --> 00:53:52,420
- What should we eat?
- I don't know.

618
00:53:54,420 --> 00:53:56,420
So hungry.

619
00:53:59,610 --> 00:54:02,240
- What are you hungry of?
- The food!

620
00:54:02,240 --> 00:54:04,240
Thank you.

621
00:54:04,240 --> 00:54:05,930
What should we eat? Soup or no soup?

622
00:54:05,930 --> 00:54:07,930
When you spend more than 1000 Baht,

623
00:54:07,930 --> 00:54:10,500
get a chance to win a prize to go see Pisa Tower...

624
00:54:11,110 --> 00:54:12,680
Hey it's in Italy?

625
00:54:13,620 --> 00:54:16,300
Isn't it in France?

626
00:54:16,300 --> 00:54:18,300
Stop being stupid.

627
00:54:19,460 --> 00:54:21,310
How can it be in France?

628
00:54:21,310 --> 00:54:23,030
Cause...

629
00:54:23,030 --> 00:54:25,030
Shit...Ta.

630
00:54:25,030 --> 00:54:27,030
I'm sorry.

631
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,030
I thought you knew.

632
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,620
I knew since after I got home on that day.

633
00:54:33,620 --> 00:54:35,620
You remember? The exam?

634
00:54:37,230 --> 00:54:39,290
Shit maybe that's why when I ask girls out on a date,

635
00:54:39,290 --> 00:54:40,990
no one's going with me.

636
00:54:40,990 --> 00:54:42,310
Do you wanna know why?

637
00:54:42,310 --> 00:54:43,350
Why?

638
00:54:43,350 --> 00:54:44,920
Because you're dumb.

639
00:54:44,920 --> 00:54:46,920
and retard.

640
00:54:49,150 --> 00:54:51,580
Hey let's go eat. It smells like someone stupid here.

641
00:54:51,580 --> 00:54:53,580
Go go.

642
00:54:53,580 --> 00:54:55,580
Ugh so smelly.

643
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,580
What about my Italy?

644
00:54:57,580 --> 00:54:59,580
Go check it out by yourself.
