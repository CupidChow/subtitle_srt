1
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,940
Last night, I saw Tong and Mew
at home.

2
00:00:37,940 --> 00:00:39,940
I understand everything now.

3
00:00:44,660 --> 00:00:46,590
Listen to me carefully, Mew.

4
00:00:48,140 --> 00:00:51,290
You know what my family
has been through, right?

5
00:00:52,690 --> 00:00:55,560
You know that I lost many things.

6
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:02,250
Tong is the only thing
that I have left.

7
00:01:03,650 --> 00:01:06,960
And I don't wanna see him
walk into a wrong path.

8
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:11,740
How?

9
00:01:14,990 --> 00:01:16,570
In the future,

10
00:01:16,570 --> 00:01:18,570
when Tong graduates,

11
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:20,570
He'll need to find a job...

12
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:22,720
Have some saving.

13
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,370
Then find a nice girl...

14
00:01:24,370 --> 00:01:26,370
getting married and have
a cute little family.

15
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,690
taking cate of each other
until they grow old.

16
00:01:30,890 --> 00:01:33,390
That's the life, Mew.

17
00:01:34,009 --> 00:01:37,400
I've raised him to grow
into that path.

18
00:01:40,660 --> 00:01:42,660
For Tong's sake,

19
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:45,440
Please stop this kind of relationship.

20
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:51,250
No matter what kind of feelings
you have for Tong.

21
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:54,300
You probably want to see
Mew be happy,

22
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:56,979
and have a good life, right?

23
00:02:59,160 --> 00:03:01,930
Eiw. It's me.
Can I come in?

24
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:03,930
Yes. Sure.

25
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:08,650
When did you arrive?

26
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,420
I got home just now.

27
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:12,420
That's why I came up
to see you first.

28
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:14,420
I'm kinda free today.

29
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:16,420
I'm gonna drive around
your school's area.

30
00:03:18,130 --> 00:03:20,810
So...are you going to
take me to school?

31
00:03:20,810 --> 00:03:21,810
Yes.

32
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:25,170
And...

33
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:27,170
...are you going to
wake Cake up first?

34
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:37,920
Well...

35
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:39,920
I'll be waiting downstairs.

36
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:42,060
- Sure.
- Let me know when you're done.

37
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,060
I'll be down in a sec.

38
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:27,380
Cake

39
00:04:28,900 --> 00:04:29,940
Cake

40
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,260
Cake

41
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:47,170
You gotta wake up.
You're late.

42
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,200
Pao will take us to school today.

43
00:04:55,820 --> 00:04:58,090
Ok. I'll get in the shower
real quick.

44
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:02,730
I'll wait downstairs ok?

45
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:18,100
Here. We've arrived.

46
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:20,500
Let's go.

47
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:24,940
Thank you for dropping us off.

48
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:27,650
Thank you!

49
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:29,650
Behave well at school.

50
00:05:29,650 --> 00:05:31,530
Sure thing bro.

51
00:05:31,530 --> 00:05:33,530
- Go.
- Drive safe, brother.

52
00:05:33,530 --> 00:05:36,220
Sure.
You too behave well, got it?

53
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,600
Yes.

54
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,600
- See you Cake.
- See ya.

55
00:05:46,330 --> 00:05:49,659
I'll go in from the other entrance.
See you at the line up.

56
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,810
- Eiw.
- Hmm?

57
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,370
What's the matter?

58
00:06:25,370 --> 00:06:27,370
You seem off lately.

59
00:06:28,480 --> 00:06:31,330
Not at all. I'm fine.

60
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:36,600
And what about the avoiding
from Cake?

61
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,290
That's totally normal, isn't it?

62
00:06:43,100 --> 00:06:44,770
Are you sure?

63
00:06:45,260 --> 00:06:47,530
Normally, you just keep distance from him.

64
00:06:47,530 --> 00:06:50,640
But now you're avoiding him.

65
00:06:51,500 --> 00:06:52,640
Hm?

66
00:06:52,640 --> 00:06:53,940
No.

67
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,680
No as in you're not tellin' me or
not avoiding him?

68
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:03,080
I'm not telling you.

69
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:10,370
Don't be so depressed.

70
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:13,440
Fee is worried about you.

71
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:21,170
Oh well...

72
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:23,170
Has he come home earlier lately?

73
00:07:23,170 --> 00:07:25,980
Um. He has.

74
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,440
Really?

75
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,850
Um.

76
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:33,220
Really?

77
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:34,220
Um.

78
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:36,220
Really?

79
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:39,409
Umm.

80
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:42,800
Why do you
keep talking to me, Kung?

81
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:45,740
You'll have a coding competition soon,
you should be studying.

82
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,659
Why do you keep talking?

83
00:07:49,320 --> 00:07:50,420
Really?

84
00:07:50,420 --> 00:07:52,920
Um. Read the book.
Read the book.

85
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:11,690
Sand!

86
00:08:13,010 --> 00:08:14,980
Hey. How long did you wait?

87
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:15,980
Not so long.

88
00:08:15,980 --> 00:08:17,980
Should we go straight
to the playground?

89
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,980
Let's go.

90
00:08:24,180 --> 00:08:25,830
Have you been to this area before?

91
00:08:25,830 --> 00:08:27,830
It's so close to the school.

92
00:08:29,140 --> 00:08:31,540
I've never been here before.

93
00:08:32,010 --> 00:08:33,539
Really?

94
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,659
So does that mean...

95
00:08:39,169 --> 00:08:41,179
you're not familiar
with activity like this?

96
00:08:42,090 --> 00:08:43,679
Yeah I guess.

97
00:08:43,679 --> 00:08:45,680
I don't like it as much.

98
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,940
Ok then.

99
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:49,940
I will show you to how to play.

100
00:08:53,280 --> 00:08:54,920
Hang on tight.

101
00:08:56,590 --> 00:08:57,840
This will be alright, won't it?

102
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:59,840
You'll be fine trust me.
I do this a lot.

103
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:05,880
But You're pretty heavy,
if the momentum is like this.

104
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:15,820
Look the pole is lifted.

105
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:15,300
Can I have 2 grilled chicken aunty?

106
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:16,600
Sure.

107
00:10:17,420 --> 00:10:18,820
This is my go-to food cart.

108
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,980
The chicken is so good,
you wanna try?

109
00:10:20,980 --> 00:10:22,980
I normally eat the wings and...

110
00:10:22,980 --> 00:10:24,380
this one.

111
00:10:24,380 --> 00:10:26,380
You should try.
This place is so good.

112
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:27,880
I highly recommend.

113
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:30,100
- This is yours.
- Thank you.

114
00:10:31,430 --> 00:10:32,620
I'll try this.

115
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,620
Try it.

116
00:10:35,750 --> 00:10:36,940
- Here.
- Thank you.

117
00:10:36,940 --> 00:10:38,240
Thank you.

118
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
- Good?
- Um.

119
00:10:41,250 --> 00:10:42,350
It's good.

120
00:10:44,300 --> 00:10:45,220
Let's go.

121
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,940
Go find some other things to eat.

122
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:48,220
Sure.

123
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:03,930
- Eiw?
- Hm?

124
00:11:05,150 --> 00:11:06,480
Go go.
Go take a shower.

125
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:08,480
Go get up.

126
00:11:10,030 --> 00:11:11,340
Get up. Come on!

127
00:11:11,340 --> 00:11:13,340
Go shower.

128
00:11:16,940 --> 00:11:18,010
Go go.

129
00:11:25,830 --> 00:11:27,270
The weather is so hot.

130
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,320
Yeah.

131
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:34,170
Uncle!

132
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:37,110
Eiw come here.

133
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,110
Come on.

134
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:43,520
Uncle I would like a cup of
coconut milk ice cream

135
00:11:43,520 --> 00:11:45,520
With sticky rice and
lots of chocolate sauce please.

136
00:11:45,610 --> 00:11:47,520
- Sure.
- Thank you.

137
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:49,660
Ice cream cart is also good.

138
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,660
Have you tried it before?

139
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:53,660
Never.

140
00:11:53,660 --> 00:11:55,180
I have tried the tube popsicle only.

141
00:11:55,180 --> 00:11:57,180
You wanna try?
What kind do you want?

142
00:11:57,180 --> 00:11:59,180
I'll order it for you.

143
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:00,740
I can have whatever you have.

144
00:12:00,740 --> 00:12:02,740
Uncle make that 2 please.

145
00:12:04,330 --> 00:12:05,750
- Sure.
- Make it 2 sir.

146
00:12:05,750 --> 00:12:07,750
How much for everything?

147
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,750
20 each.

148
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:17,620
What are you looking for?

149
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:20,680
My money.

150
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:24,690
I can't find my money.
Don't know where I dropped it.

151
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,730
At the swing maybe?

152
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,370
Probably.

153
00:12:30,370 --> 00:12:32,220
Let me go look for it.

154
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:33,520
Hey that's fine.

155
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:35,520
I'll pay for it.

156
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:37,520
then we can go look for it together.

157
00:12:37,820 --> 00:12:40,120
- You sure?
- Um. I'm sure.

158
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:41,850
Fine.

159
00:12:41,850 --> 00:12:43,480
Thanks.

160
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:45,480
That's okay.
This is very little.

161
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,210
Sand.

162
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,910
I think it's gone.

163
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,770
If my dad found out
that I lost it,

164
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:02,770
he would kill me.

165
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:08,420
It's okay.
This one on me.

166
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:10,330
Really?

167
00:13:10,330 --> 00:13:11,480
Um. Really.

168
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,480
How about you take me
to pick mangos next time?

169
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:15,480
Ok.

170
00:13:18,950 --> 00:13:20,380
Well...

171
00:13:20,380 --> 00:13:22,380
can I borrow your money?

172
00:13:23,690 --> 00:13:25,580
I don't have any money
left to get home.

173
00:13:25,580 --> 00:13:27,240
Oh sure.

174
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:29,240
Take this.

175
00:13:29,950 --> 00:13:31,240
Are you sure about this?

176
00:13:32,300 --> 00:13:33,650
Um I'm sure.

177
00:13:35,770 --> 00:13:37,900
Do you have left for yourself?

178
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:39,900
It's okay.
I can just borrow Cake.

179
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,440
Here. This is all I have.

180
00:13:43,750 --> 00:13:45,090
Thanks Eiw.

181
00:13:47,530 --> 00:13:48,810
The ice cream is melting.

182
00:13:50,070 --> 00:13:51,680
We were too busy
with the search.

183
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,730
Let's just eat.

184
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,730
It's all melted.

185
00:13:59,450 --> 00:14:00,730
"Mama's Dim Sum"

186
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,270
Good evening mom.

187
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:11,140
Lately, you get home so late.

188
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:13,140
Where've you been?

189
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:15,810
I was around the school area.

190
00:14:16,470 --> 00:14:19,080
I don't see Cake
coming over a lot like usual.

191
00:14:24,090 --> 00:14:25,920
He's been busy mom.

192
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:27,920
Having distance
sometimes is not so bad.

193
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:37,420
Mom.

194
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,180
Is Hom home?

195
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:40,620
Since afternoon.

196
00:14:40,620 --> 00:14:42,230
She's probably upstairs sleeping.

197
00:14:42,230 --> 00:14:44,230
She seems so tired.

198
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:48,070
Go.

199
00:14:48,070 --> 00:14:50,310
Go change
and come down for dinner.

200
00:15:33,010 --> 00:15:35,320
Eiw, what are you doing here?

201
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:39,680
Hom.

202
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:43,910
Can I talk to you for a bit?

203
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:46,640
What's wrong?

204
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,640
Did someone do something to you?

205
00:15:50,760 --> 00:15:52,720
It's me.

206
00:15:54,570 --> 00:15:56,570
What did you do?

207
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:58,570
Tell me.

208
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:05,160
Sis.

209
00:16:05,670 --> 00:16:07,300
Do you remember that day?

210
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:09,300
That we watched the movie together?

211
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:13,290
I went down
and continued the rest alone.

212
00:16:13,980 --> 00:16:15,290
Eiw.

213
00:16:29,660 --> 00:16:31,700
I'm not sure.

214
00:16:40,120 --> 00:16:42,010
But I think...

215
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:44,970
I feel that way with Cake...

216
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:48,070
See-Eiw.

217
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:53,370
It's okay.

218
00:16:53,370 --> 00:16:55,370
You'll be okay.

219
00:16:55,890 --> 00:16:57,480
It's okay.

220
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,470
Why are you crying?

221
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,050
I don't know.

222
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,050
Are you sad?

223
00:17:20,030 --> 00:17:21,390
I don't know.

224
00:17:23,160 --> 00:17:24,359
Well...

225
00:17:25,530 --> 00:17:27,640
how do you feel right now?

226
00:17:35,470 --> 00:17:37,290
I feel like..

227
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,240
I feel like I'm doing
something wrong.

228
00:17:43,010 --> 00:17:45,430
Like I'm abnormal.

229
00:17:53,260 --> 00:17:55,880
I feel like I'm a stain.

230
00:18:00,530 --> 00:18:02,770
I'm being my own name.

231
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:05,930
What do you mean?

232
00:18:07,930 --> 00:18:09,320
It's black.
(soy sauce has black color)

233
00:18:09,320 --> 00:18:11,320
Eiw.

234
00:18:14,260 --> 00:18:16,310
Listen to me.

235
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:19,140
You've done nothing wrong.

236
00:18:19,960 --> 00:18:22,180
You're not a stain or dirty.

237
00:18:28,090 --> 00:18:29,940
Sis.

238
00:18:30,730 --> 00:18:32,350
If it's not wrong,

239
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:38,030
then why does everyone
in that movie is not happy?

240
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,540
Why does Tong's mom cry?

241
00:18:44,540 --> 00:18:47,040
Why is she so sad?

242
00:18:48,360 --> 00:18:51,940
Why does everyone think that
both of them are strange?

243
00:18:53,180 --> 00:18:55,140
Answer me please.

244
00:18:59,340 --> 00:19:00,570
Sis.

245
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,570
If it's not wrong,

246
00:19:03,660 --> 00:19:05,990
why everything is all bad
for everyone in the movie?

247
00:19:05,990 --> 00:19:07,990
Why does everyone hurt?

248
00:19:08,950 --> 00:19:10,520
Why?

249
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,520
How come I feel...

250
00:19:12,810 --> 00:19:14,520
unhappy?

251
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:22,040
I don't really know how it feels.

252
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,530
But...

253
00:19:26,530 --> 00:19:29,210
you're still my brother
no matter what.

254
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,590
You're the same
in every aspect to me.

255
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:34,590
There's nothing different.

256
00:19:38,600 --> 00:19:40,280
But I don't know...

257
00:19:41,290 --> 00:19:44,330
You don't have to know exactly
how you feel yet.

258
00:19:44,680 --> 00:19:47,070
Even I'm way older than you,

259
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:49,070
I still can't figure it out.

260
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,360
Take you time
to look for an answer.

261
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:57,920
What if at the end...

262
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:02,940
I still can't find the answer?

263
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:07,750
You're still the same brother to me.

264
00:20:08,970 --> 00:20:10,240
Ok?

265
00:20:12,360 --> 00:20:13,720
Here.
Come hug me.

266
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,530
It's okay.

267
00:20:22,530 --> 00:20:24,530
I love you sis.

268
00:20:25,020 --> 00:20:26,530
I love you too.

269
00:20:28,700 --> 00:20:29,980
Everything will be okay.

270
00:20:34,210 --> 00:20:36,620
I don't see you hang out
with Cake lately.

271
00:20:40,450 --> 00:20:41,920
He has a girlfriend now.

272
00:20:42,790 --> 00:20:44,250
Always talking on the phone.

273
00:20:44,250 --> 00:20:46,250
Wow he's got a girlfriend?

274
00:20:46,410 --> 00:20:48,250
He's still a child.

275
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,970
Kid these days
are in relationship so early.

276
00:20:53,980 --> 00:20:55,790
What about you?

277
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:58,620
Ugh sis.

278
00:20:58,620 --> 00:21:00,620
How can I have one?

279
00:21:00,910 --> 00:21:02,890
That's good,
so you can be with me.

280
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:08,900
Why're you still up?
It's late.

281
00:21:10,580 --> 00:21:11,820
I can't sleep.

282
00:21:12,230 --> 00:21:13,490
You won't be able..

283
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:15,490
to wake up for school.

284
00:21:38,040 --> 00:21:39,620
You're feeling better?

285
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,810
Yes.

286
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,840
You eyes are all puffy.

287
00:21:47,340 --> 00:21:48,840
Stop crying.

288
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:55,770
Do you wanna sleep
in my room tonight?

289
00:21:57,260 --> 00:21:58,900
That's fine.

290
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:03,260
I will sleep in my room.

291
00:22:03,570 --> 00:22:05,260
You have to work also.

292
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,340
But whenever you're not okay,

293
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:12,340
you can always come to me.

294
00:22:12,730 --> 00:22:14,340
Ok?

295
00:22:18,920 --> 00:22:20,440
I love you.

296
00:22:21,270 --> 00:22:22,710
I love you too.

297
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:27,530
Eiw.

298
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:29,530
Hm?

299
00:22:29,530 --> 00:22:31,930
See-Eiw has black color
does't mean it's bad.

300
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:35,670
It actually makes the food taste better.

301
00:22:37,670 --> 00:22:41,050
It is a key ingredient for cooking,
you know that right?

302
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,640
You'll be fine.

303
00:23:09,420 --> 00:23:11,340
Cake.

304
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:13,590
Where have you been?

305
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,960
I've been reading
and waiting for hours.

306
00:23:19,700 --> 00:23:21,790
I went to see Hom.

307
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,490
What are you doing?

308
00:23:39,490 --> 00:23:41,490
Thought we don't have
any homework today?

309
00:23:47,780 --> 00:23:49,290
I'm preparing books
for tomorrow.

310
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:06,330
Are you gonna sleep here tonight?

311
00:24:08,330 --> 00:24:09,270
Yes.

312
00:24:13,000 --> 00:24:15,690
But I will go sleep with Hom today.

313
00:24:16,460 --> 00:24:17,690
What?

314
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:19,690
Why?

315
00:24:19,930 --> 00:24:21,690
She's not home that often.

316
00:24:21,690 --> 00:24:23,690
I miss her.

317
00:24:24,450 --> 00:24:27,300
You haven't spent time
with me lately as well.

318
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:29,300
You go home and disappear from me.

319
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:31,790
How come you don't hang out
at my place anymore?

320
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:37,530
I've been reading books.

321
00:24:38,840 --> 00:24:40,780
You can be on your computer
and your phone.

322
00:24:46,850 --> 00:24:48,340
Are you mad at me?

323
00:24:50,570 --> 00:24:52,000
No I'm not.

324
00:24:58,160 --> 00:24:59,700
Then why have
you been avoiding me?

325
00:25:01,700 --> 00:25:03,020
What?

326
00:25:03,020 --> 00:25:05,020
You're overthinking.

327
00:25:06,460 --> 00:25:07,970
You should go back to your room.

328
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:10,980
I will sleep with Hom tonight.

329
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:14,100
Come sit here.

330
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:16,100
What?

331
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:19,230
Come sit with me.

332
00:25:19,230 --> 00:25:21,230
and talk nicely.

333
00:25:21,390 --> 00:25:23,230
Talk abotut what?

334
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:25,230
See.

335
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:27,500
Normally you would
come sit already.

336
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:29,500
You wouldn't
ask why like that.

337
00:25:29,890 --> 00:25:32,170
Cause I'm fine.
Really.

338
00:25:33,850 --> 00:25:35,260
You're overthinking.

339
00:25:37,460 --> 00:25:39,540
You're mad
because I go home late?

340
00:25:39,930 --> 00:25:41,540
No.

341
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:45,080
I'll go home earlier, okay?

342
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:46,380
No.

343
00:25:47,420 --> 00:25:49,660
I will hang out with my friend
tomorrow after school.

344
00:25:49,660 --> 00:25:51,660
I'll be fine by myself.

345
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:53,270
Friend?

346
00:25:53,270 --> 00:25:55,270
Is it Fee? Or Kung?

347
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:59,050
It's Sand.

348
00:25:59,620 --> 00:26:01,540
I've known him not long ago.

349
00:26:03,320 --> 00:26:04,820
New friend?

350
00:26:05,910 --> 00:26:07,000
Um.

351
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:09,000
I met him at the bus stop.

352
00:26:11,240 --> 00:26:12,520
Which class is he in?

353
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,520
Is he legit?

354
00:26:14,730 --> 00:26:16,520
Not a problematic one?

355
00:26:16,520 --> 00:26:18,520
No, Sand is a good guy.

356
00:26:18,980 --> 00:26:21,090
How can you trust?
You just met him.

357
00:26:21,900 --> 00:26:23,900
Introduce him to me sometimes.

358
00:26:24,930 --> 00:26:27,880
I can take care of myself.
Can you just leave me alone?

359
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:45,690
So...

360
00:26:46,830 --> 00:26:48,220
I meddle with your business?

361
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,220
No...

362
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:52,220
I didn't mean in that way.

363
00:26:53,790 --> 00:26:55,400
I just meant...

364
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,400
you don't have to worry...

365
00:26:57,400 --> 00:27:00,080
or care about me.

366
00:27:12,140 --> 00:27:13,720
I care about you.

367
00:27:27,740 --> 00:27:29,130
I'm sorry.

368
00:27:33,670 --> 00:27:35,610
Don't say that again.

369
00:27:35,740 --> 00:27:37,610
I'm sad.

370
00:27:40,120 --> 00:27:41,780
No more.

371
00:27:47,550 --> 00:27:50,120
I know that you can take care
of yourself.

372
00:27:50,560 --> 00:27:52,770
but if there's something,
let me know too.

373
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,770
Please?

374
00:27:56,410 --> 00:27:58,330
I won't say that again.

375
00:28:03,060 --> 00:28:04,170
Ow.

376
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:05,910
That hurts.

377
00:28:05,910 --> 00:28:07,910
That's a punishment.

378
00:28:09,850 --> 00:28:12,560
So are you going to sleep
with Hom tonight, right?

379
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:15,010
I'll have to go back
to my room then?

380
00:28:16,360 --> 00:28:18,380
Um. I guess so.

381
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:25,820
Ok.

382
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:27,820
I will go to sleep by myself.

383
00:28:27,820 --> 00:28:29,820
See you tomorrow.

384
00:28:33,330 --> 00:28:34,730
Cake.

385
00:28:35,870 --> 00:28:37,870
You can stay here.

386
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:43,320
Aren't you going to Hom's room?

387
00:28:44,490 --> 00:28:45,580
No. Not anymore.

388
00:28:45,580 --> 00:28:47,580
I changed my mind.

389
00:28:50,390 --> 00:28:51,950
That's a relief.

390
00:28:57,530 --> 00:28:59,710
You have your own room,
but never use it.

391
00:29:02,810 --> 00:29:04,860
You can't say that.

392
00:29:04,860 --> 00:29:06,860
Cause you used to sleep
in my room everyday.

393
00:29:06,860 --> 00:29:08,860
I've never been selfish with you.

394
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,520
Go turn the lights off,
and come to bed.

395
00:29:12,620 --> 00:29:13,850
Fine.

396
00:29:43,800 --> 00:29:46,230
You're not gonna talk
on the phone tonight?

397
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:49,420
I already did.

398
00:29:49,870 --> 00:29:51,420
Rin went to sleep early tonight.

399
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:54,440
Oh.

400
00:30:12,860 --> 00:30:14,150
Soy milk.

401
00:30:14,150 --> 00:30:16,150
- Thank you sis.
- Sure.

402
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:18,150
Looks yummy.

403
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:21,170
How're you doing? Better?

404
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,630
Um I'm okay now.

405
00:30:24,500 --> 00:30:26,540
What about with Cake?

406
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:28,540
any problems?

407
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:30,540
Is there anything
you would like to tell me?

408
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,420
Nope. Nothing.

409
00:30:34,420 --> 00:30:36,420
With Cake...

410
00:30:36,420 --> 00:30:38,420
...everything is the same.

411
00:30:38,420 --> 00:30:40,300
Really?

412
00:30:40,300 --> 00:30:42,880
And why are you here alone then?

413
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:44,370
Not going to Cake's room?

414
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:45,670
Oh.

415
00:30:46,120 --> 00:30:48,710
Cake will be with his friends today
working on some report.

416
00:30:48,710 --> 00:30:50,710
I don't wanna interrupt them.

417
00:30:51,160 --> 00:30:52,710
- Oh actually.
- Hm?

418
00:30:52,810 --> 00:30:54,710
I just realized I have something
I wanna ask.

419
00:30:55,340 --> 00:30:56,710
What is it?

420
00:30:56,950 --> 00:30:59,500
Has Peak been bugging
or disturbing you?

421
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:01,500
- Peak?
- Yeah.

422
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:03,500
Bugging me how?

423
00:31:03,710 --> 00:31:05,610
Cake told me a few times...

424
00:31:05,610 --> 00:31:09,230
that Peak's been sleeping over
at his place lot lately.

425
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:11,600
He said he wants to see you.

426
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:15,000
Why would he want to see me?

427
00:31:15,720 --> 00:31:17,660
Hmm...I don't know.

428
00:31:17,890 --> 00:31:21,220
A lot of people at school
say that...

429
00:31:21,220 --> 00:31:24,010
...he's a player.

430
00:31:24,010 --> 00:31:26,550
I don't want you
to be involved with him.

431
00:31:26,850 --> 00:31:28,640
There's nothing between us.

432
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,890
You guys are still kids.

433
00:31:31,660 --> 00:31:34,280
You're protective of me?

434
00:31:34,280 --> 00:31:36,680
I am!

435
00:31:36,680 --> 00:31:39,080
You're my sister.

436
00:31:39,380 --> 00:31:41,080
I don't want anyone
to be with you.

437
00:31:41,080 --> 00:31:42,480
There's nothing.

438
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,480
You're overthinking.

439
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,430
You guys are just kids.

440
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:49,850
Still in high school.

441
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:51,520
Why?

442
00:31:51,520 --> 00:31:53,520
It's nothing.

443
00:31:53,750 --> 00:31:55,520
Go do you homework.

444
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:59,910
It's nothing.

445
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,650
Fine.

446
00:32:10,890 --> 00:32:12,700
You hurry and go get the report.

447
00:32:12,700 --> 00:32:14,700
I am hurrying.

448
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:17,940
Actually, your report is here.

449
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:19,030
Why don't we just work here?

450
00:32:19,030 --> 00:32:20,620
We can let Cake catch us later.

451
00:32:20,620 --> 00:32:22,390
Why do you wanna
go there so much?

452
00:32:22,860 --> 00:32:23,940
Yeah. Waste of time.

453
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:25,940
You guys are annoying.

454
00:32:25,940 --> 00:32:27,710
It's you!

455
00:32:27,710 --> 00:32:29,420
You wanna go to Cake's
just tell us already.

456
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,420
I know that you...

457
00:32:31,420 --> 00:32:33,420
wanna go flirt with Hom right?

458
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:35,420
- I also know that.
- Stop being nosy.

459
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:38,320
Even we are not fortune tellers,

460
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:40,320
we still know Peak!

461
00:32:41,740 --> 00:32:43,050
You guys are nonsense.

462
00:32:43,050 --> 00:32:45,050
I'll go up and get the report.

463
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,180
Why are you following me?

464
00:32:48,180 --> 00:32:49,690
Go. Go wait there.

465
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,390
I'll go get it by myself.
It'll be quick.

466
00:32:51,390 --> 00:32:52,920
What?

467
00:32:52,920 --> 00:32:54,920
Let's just go wait there.

468
00:33:31,520 --> 00:33:33,050
You're so naughty.

469
00:33:33,050 --> 00:33:34,780
I'll tell dad
once we get home.

470
00:33:34,780 --> 00:33:36,220
Go go.

471
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:38,220
Hang on tight.

472
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:40,730
Hang tight come on.

473
00:33:41,260 --> 00:33:42,730
Are you hurt?
Oh.

474
00:33:44,250 --> 00:33:46,120
Go catch them.

475
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,090
Easy.

476
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:01,240
They look like
they're having so much fun.

477
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,710
Kids have so much energy.

478
00:34:02,710 --> 00:34:04,710
They don't seem
to get tired at all.

479
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:09,400
Yeah. There's plenty for them.

480
00:34:12,889 --> 00:34:15,520
You have to take care of
3 siblings like this...

481
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:17,520
...do you get tired?

482
00:34:20,540 --> 00:34:22,080
I do.

483
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:25,389
Especially when my mom
is not here anymore.

484
00:34:29,830 --> 00:34:31,500
Sorry.

485
00:34:32,540 --> 00:34:34,900
Why do you say sorry?

486
00:34:34,900 --> 00:34:36,900
It's okay.

487
00:34:36,900 --> 00:34:38,900
It's actually okay now really.

488
00:34:39,989 --> 00:34:42,179
My dad and I help each other
to take care of them.

489
00:34:42,770 --> 00:34:45,730
How about I come help you
babysit more often?

490
00:34:46,699 --> 00:34:48,210
Sure!

491
00:34:48,210 --> 00:34:50,210
You're always welcome, Eiw.

492
00:34:50,739 --> 00:34:52,210
So my brothers won't be lonely.

493
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:54,210
Um. Sure.

494
00:35:13,340 --> 00:35:15,470
Are you going straight home?

495
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:17,470
Um. Probably.

496
00:35:17,470 --> 00:35:18,830
We don't have the usual rehearsal today.

497
00:35:18,830 --> 00:35:20,830
I wanna go home early.
You?

498
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:22,750
Me too.

499
00:35:22,750 --> 00:35:26,990
My dad always say I don't remember the way
home since I got into uni.

500
00:35:26,990 --> 00:35:28,990
Yeah we're pretty much the same.

501
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:32,110
Oh about Saturday...

502
00:35:32,110 --> 00:35:34,110
Are the boys gonna come help again?

503
00:35:34,250 --> 00:35:35,630
They probably are.

504
00:35:35,630 --> 00:35:38,500
Cake just asked me the other day
whether it's the same time.

505
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:41,080
So that means...

506
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,510
Peak, the hot one,
will come too right?

507
00:35:44,080 --> 00:35:45,690
Probably.

508
00:35:46,930 --> 00:35:48,560
He wouldn't miss it.

509
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:51,370
A chance to see Ton-Hom.

510
00:35:51,750 --> 00:35:53,370
What are you talking about?

511
00:35:53,970 --> 00:35:56,870
I can tell even I'm on Mars
that he has feelings for you.

512
00:35:56,870 --> 00:35:59,280
Ugh. Nonsense.

513
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,390
It's obvious.

514
00:36:07,880 --> 00:36:09,390
Obvious what?

515
00:36:12,920 --> 00:36:15,360
Are you still saying I'm nonsense?

516
00:36:15,360 --> 00:36:17,850
Take care of that.
I'm going home now.

517
00:36:17,850 --> 00:36:19,850
Hey wait Meen!

518
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,850
Bye bye.

519
00:36:29,470 --> 00:36:30,790
What are you doing here?

520
00:36:30,790 --> 00:36:32,790
We don't need any help today.

521
00:36:32,910 --> 00:36:34,390
I came here to see you.

522
00:36:34,390 --> 00:36:35,650
Me?

523
00:36:35,650 --> 00:36:37,650
For what?

524
00:36:38,850 --> 00:36:41,570
Have you eaten?
I'm super hungry.

525
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:48,630
I'm thinking of
going home for dinner.

526
00:36:48,630 --> 00:36:50,630
You should go.

527
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,320
Hey!

528
00:36:53,320 --> 00:36:55,320
I don't have anyone at home.

529
00:36:55,320 --> 00:36:57,320
I don't know this area that well too.

530
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:02,860
But it's okay.

531
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:04,860
You can dinner at home.

532
00:37:05,330 --> 00:37:07,280
I will go find a place
and eat alone.

533
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,280
Ah...ok.

534
00:37:15,280 --> 00:37:16,590
I'll take you.

535
00:37:16,590 --> 00:37:18,590
Really?

536
00:37:19,520 --> 00:37:21,120
I thought I'm gonna starve to death.

537
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,120
Thank you.

538
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:27,060
Let's go.

539
00:37:28,460 --> 00:37:31,020
That was a stiff acting by the way.

540
00:37:31,020 --> 00:37:32,660
So you're not tired anymore?

541
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,660
Nope. I wanna eat now.

542
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,890
I'm at Sand's.

543
00:37:38,210 --> 00:37:39,890
You didn't tell me.

544
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:46,450
I called you,
but you didn't answer.

545
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:48,450
So I texted you.

546
00:37:48,670 --> 00:37:50,450
Why didn't you wait?

547
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,550
It's not a big deal.

548
00:37:53,550 --> 00:37:55,550
Sand will take me home.

549
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:58,700
How can you go over to someone's house
who you just met?

550
00:37:59,380 --> 00:38:01,470
At least take me with you.

551
00:38:02,090 --> 00:38:04,110
This is my friend.

552
00:38:04,110 --> 00:38:05,580
You don't even know him.

553
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:07,580
Introduce him to me then.

554
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,720
You're with Rin.

555
00:38:11,720 --> 00:38:13,720
What do you expect me to do?

556
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
But this is almost 5pm already.

557
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:18,740
Um.

558
00:38:18,740 --> 00:38:21,680
I already inform my mom
that I'll be home late.

559
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:23,680
Talk to you later Cake.

560
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:25,680
I'm gonna go play now.

561
00:38:25,810 --> 00:38:27,680
I'll wait for you at home.

562
00:38:30,470 --> 00:38:32,170
Um.

563
00:38:32,170 --> 00:38:34,170
I'm gonna hang up now.

564
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:55,060
Be careful guys.
Don't fall.

565
00:38:58,960 --> 00:39:00,190
You're done on the phone?

566
00:39:00,190 --> 00:39:02,070
Yeah I am.

567
00:39:02,070 --> 00:39:04,070
But I have to go home now.

568
00:39:04,540 --> 00:39:06,810
Why?

569
00:39:06,810 --> 00:39:08,810
You just got here not long ago.

570
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,620
I'll come again.

571
00:39:10,620 --> 00:39:13,050
My mom is worried
that I'll be home late.

572
00:39:13,890 --> 00:39:15,480
Ok well...

573
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:17,760
I will take my brothers home first.

574
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:19,760
and I will take you home too.

575
00:39:20,330 --> 00:39:22,520
Are you goin home already
See-Eiw?

576
00:39:22,980 --> 00:39:24,050
Yes.

577
00:39:24,050 --> 00:39:26,430
- I'll come play with you again ok?
- Sure.

578
00:39:27,500 --> 00:39:29,370
Good boy.

579
00:39:29,370 --> 00:39:31,840
Let's go home.
Times up boys.

580
00:39:31,840 --> 00:39:33,840
Let's go home.

581
00:39:34,660 --> 00:39:36,740
Do you wanna continue playing?

582
00:39:36,740 --> 00:39:38,740
Too fun to stop right?

583
00:39:45,150 --> 00:39:46,930
I'm getting hungry.

584
00:39:46,930 --> 00:39:48,750
Me too.

585
00:39:48,750 --> 00:39:50,750
Should we stop to eat something?

586
00:39:51,000 --> 00:39:52,750
Sure.

587
00:39:53,170 --> 00:39:55,810
Oh or do you wanna
have dinner at my place?

588
00:39:55,810 --> 00:39:58,920
My mom makes the best
home-cooked food. Like this good.

589
00:39:58,920 --> 00:40:00,460
Really?

590
00:40:00,460 --> 00:40:02,380
She's also good with bakery.

591
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:04,380
Whenever she cooks,
I always eat almost all of it.

592
00:40:04,380 --> 00:40:06,380
Like my belly could explode.

593
00:40:07,070 --> 00:40:08,840
- That's good.
- Um.

594
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:12,650
I'll bring some for you to try.

595
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:14,020
Um.

596
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:16,020
But...

597
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:18,460
Around my place has the best
Pad Thai with omelette.

598
00:40:18,460 --> 00:40:20,000
Don't you wanna try?

599
00:40:20,000 --> 00:40:22,000
Around here?

600
00:40:22,000 --> 00:40:24,000
Just around the corner of the valley.

601
00:40:24,100 --> 00:40:26,630
I'll go to your place
next time then?

602
00:40:27,050 --> 00:40:29,830
Ok we'll go with your plan.

603
00:40:33,580 --> 00:40:35,300
"Mama's Dim Sum"

604
00:40:41,750 --> 00:40:43,660
Get home safely.

605
00:40:48,330 --> 00:40:50,180
Evening mom.

606
00:40:50,390 --> 00:40:51,550
Have you eaten?

607
00:40:51,550 --> 00:40:53,190
I'm all good.

608
00:40:53,190 --> 00:40:54,620
What about you?
Have you eaten?

609
00:40:54,620 --> 00:40:56,190
I did.

610
00:40:56,190 --> 00:40:58,190
Who was that just now?

611
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:01,430
Who do you mean?

612
00:41:01,810 --> 00:41:03,950
I think I'm gonna go shower.

613
00:41:03,950 --> 00:41:05,950
My whole body is so sticky.

614
00:41:05,950 --> 00:41:07,950
I will come down
and help in a bit.

615
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:19,970
I don't have any homework today.

616
00:41:24,740 --> 00:41:26,970
Are you going to sleep already?

617
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:29,590
What about you?
You got any homework?

618
00:41:38,030 --> 00:41:39,390
Are you going to sleep?

619
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:41,390
Yeah. I am.

620
00:41:42,430 --> 00:41:44,510
Why do you go to bed
early today?

621
00:41:45,370 --> 00:41:46,870
I'm exhausted.

622
00:41:46,870 --> 00:41:48,870
Been playing all day.

623
00:41:52,630 --> 00:41:54,590
Are you mad at me?

624
00:41:56,990 --> 00:41:58,330
Hm?

625
00:41:59,830 --> 00:42:01,510
I'm not.

626
00:42:01,780 --> 00:42:03,370
How can I be mad at you?

627
00:42:03,370 --> 00:42:04,770
Well...

628
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:06,770
I'm not around lately.

629
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:09,410
Get home late.

630
00:42:09,410 --> 00:42:11,410
Leave you alone a lot.

631
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:16,130
I'm not mad.

632
00:42:16,130 --> 00:42:18,130
You are.

633
00:42:18,860 --> 00:42:20,130
I'm not.

634
00:42:20,130 --> 00:42:22,540
If you don't believe me,
then why're you asking?

635
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:24,590
Look at you.

636
00:42:24,590 --> 00:42:26,760
Avoiding eye-contact like this.

637
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:28,760
100% mad.

638
00:42:48,710 --> 00:42:50,010
Cake!

639
00:42:50,010 --> 00:42:52,010
Cake, can I talk to you for a minute?

640
00:42:52,770 --> 00:42:54,630
Please wait outside See-Eiw.

641
00:42:54,630 --> 00:42:56,630
I don't know
where's Sand been.

642
00:42:56,630 --> 00:42:58,630
Haven't seen him many days already.

643
00:42:59,010 --> 00:43:00,630
Have you met Sand?

644
00:43:01,210 --> 00:43:02,930
I've never met him before.

645
00:43:02,930 --> 00:43:04,930
Eiw wouldn't introduce him to me.

646
00:43:05,330 --> 00:43:07,690
- Who made you cry?
- Nothing.

647
00:43:07,690 --> 00:43:08,880
What's the matter Eiw?

648
00:43:08,880 --> 00:43:10,880
Who made you cry.
Tell me.

649
00:43:11,320 --> 00:43:15,070
Cake got called to the Principal's office.

650
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:17,070
Ha why?

651
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:19,320
Let's discuss later Eiw.

652
00:43:19,320 --> 00:43:20,620
Mom is waiting downstairs.
