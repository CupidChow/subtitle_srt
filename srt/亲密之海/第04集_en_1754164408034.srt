1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:24,960
Famosperosis means Nowadays Beneficiaries

2
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:26,880
Deliberation is everywhere

3
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,640
It's unbearable

4
00:00:27,640 --> 00:00:29,720
When there's trouble, you'll hide behind your parents

5
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,280
I shouldn't have agreed to a interview with Hong Yifeng.

6
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,600
He'll get his revenge sooner or later.

7
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,240
Besides, his show is so popular now.

8
00:00:38,240 --> 00:00:40,240
You should be thankful too.

9
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:43,400
Come in.

10
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:46,880
Director General, the chairman's wife is here. She's on the phone.

11
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:50,680
I'll go out for a bit.

12
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:52,680
It's okay. Don't bother.

13
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,280
Chen Xiaowen.

14
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:56,480
Where is Li Xianhong?

15
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,080
Madam, we're also in touch.

16
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,480
Today, the stock price dropped by 27 yuan at the opening.

17
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:04,920
I don't care how he'll do things outside.

18
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:07,320
But as the general manager, you're dealing with a crisis.

19
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,320
We should be responsible for the investment.

20
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,600
Who agreed to an interview with Hong Yifeng?

21
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,600
It's all my call.

22
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,920
You won't think about the consequences?

23
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,720
Li Xianhong failed to come back to you.

24
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,720
You think he'll quit his job?

25
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:32,720
You don't understand this?

26
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:47,040
Xiaowen, thank you.

27
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,440
I'm sorry for causing you so much trouble.

28
00:01:50,440 --> 00:01:52,080
Who are these people?

29
00:01:52,080 --> 00:01:54,440
How could the chairman get together with them?

30
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:57,560
There was no problem when they were interviewed yesterday, right?

31
00:01:57,560 --> 00:01:59,840
I don't know these young people either.

32
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:01,840
But I'll try to figure it out.

33
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:04,480
I'll report to you later.

34
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,480
I'll go out now.

35
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:29,560
Hi, Yifeng.

36
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:31,560
What's wrong?

37
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:32,560
Why are you looking for me?

38
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:34,560
I'm just wasting a little time.

39
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,560
It won't be long.

40
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:41,560
You should know why I'm here.

41
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,560
How would I know if you don't tell me?

42
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,560
I'm here to see you.

43
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,560
I'm here to see you.

44
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,560
I'm here to see you.

45
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:52,560
I'm here to see you.

46
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:54,560
I'm here to see you.

47
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:56,560
I'm here to see you.

48
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:58,560
I see.

49
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,560
Or is this what Li Xianhong taught you?

50
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:06,560
I didn't think that I would be so easily fooled.

51
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
But I chose to believe you because of my professional respect for you.

52
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,560
But the fact proves that I'm too naive.

53
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:18,560
I know he's not perfect.

54
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:20,560
But he's not a bad person.

55
00:03:20,560 --> 00:03:23,560
He didn't take advantage of Taiwan's resources to go to the streets.

56
00:03:23,560 --> 00:03:28,560
He's not fair to the general public for using his image of a business demon.

57
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:31,560
Besides, you're causing a controversy.

58
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:33,560
It's not good for Taiwan.

59
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:35,560
Don't be so high-profile.

60
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,560
Why don't you just tell me that my news has caused a lot of damage to your image?

61
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,560
Maybe I'll respect you more.

62
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,560
Don't you think that when the media uses Facebook content,

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:47,560
they need to make a real assessment?

64
00:03:47,560 --> 00:03:50,560
Every word in the film was said by Li Xianhong himself.

65
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,560
And the fact that he argued with his husband was also a fact.

66
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:56,560
I don't think we're misleading the audience.

67
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,560
Or should we first go through the review of the Zhe'er Cultural Group?

68
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:16,560
Here, the real deal.

69
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,560
Don't blame him.

70
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:22,560
I forced him to bring me here.

71
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,560
I didn't mean to avoid the people in the office.

72
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,560
Boss Fan, to be honest,

73
00:04:33,560 --> 00:04:36,560
you don't have to reply to the messages on the Internet.

74
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,560
Do you want me to remain silent,

75
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:42,560
let them slander and attack me?

76
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,560
The communication between generations is different.

77
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,560
I sincerely suggest that we should go back to the traditional media.

78
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:50,560
That's our familiar battlefield.

79
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,560
Isn't it better to give up the Internet and communicate with the young?

80
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,560
Besides, most of our customers are young people.

81
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,560
If we only go to the traditional media, we'll be far away from them.

82
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:01,560
I understand that.

83
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:06,560
But traditional media can let everyone get the same message at the same time.

84
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,560
Although everyone has different views, it doesn't matter.

85
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:11,560
But at least we get a chance to make it clear.

86
00:05:11,560 --> 00:05:14,560
This may also cause a bigger argument.

87
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:17,560
Do you think it's good?

88
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,560
Is it really good?

89
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,560
Here, have some hot soup.

90
00:05:27,560 --> 00:05:30,560
Drink it first. Don't be so serious.

91
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:35,560
The messages on the Internet are very unreasonable.

92
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:38,560
Even if we explain them one by one, it may not be clear.

93
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:40,560
They are all behind the Facebook.

94
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,560
We don't know who they are.

95
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,560
They are using the image of profit and loss on you.

96
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:48,560
It's a wrong confrontation.

97
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,560
I'm not a person who doesn't want to fight.

98
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:53,560
I know you are not.

99
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:56,560
But boss, please give me a chance to make it clear.

100
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,560
Okay. What are you going to do?

101
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:03,560
Lin Xianhong is an individual.

102
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:06,560
And the people in the battle suit and the community are a group of people.

103
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,560
Individual statements and public opinion shouldn't be put in the same news.

104
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,560
Besides, you have never seen a bad news.

105
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:15,560
So you want to discuss the news theory with me now?

106
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,560
Then I think we don't have to waste time.

107
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:20,560
You can go up the elevator and find the senior in the TV station.

108
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,560
Thank you, boss.

109
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,560
If you tell others that you have a relationship with him,

110
00:06:29,560 --> 00:06:32,560
will everyone give you a big question mark

111
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,560
in the professionalism of this news?

112
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:38,560
I hope you will go to Hong Li Fang's live broadcast again.

113
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:40,560
You still believe him?

114
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:42,560
He came up with this.

115
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,560
He created two generations of controversy.

116
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,560
I think it's the best way to solve this on his show.

117
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,560
I'm afraid he won't handle it on his own.

118
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:52,560
And Xiao Wen is still the general manager of the group.

119
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,560
I have reminded him that if his past love history is dug out,

120
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:56,560
I believe...

121
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
Okay, stop talking.

122
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,560
It's decided.

123
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,560
You arrange it.

124
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:07,560
Thank you, boss.

125
00:07:09,560 --> 00:07:11,560
It's a long time ago.

126
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,560
Do you think it can still work?

127
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:22,560
But you're not the reporter from a long time ago, are you?

128
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,560
Hong Li Fang's live broadcast.

129
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,560
What do you want?

130
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,560
Give him a chance.

131
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:38,560
Let him go on my live broadcast.

132
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:40,560
This is a win-win situation.

133
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,560
You will earn your income.

134
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:46,560
And he got a chance to make up for his own mistakes.

135
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:51,560
But I need you to promise to keep your loyalty.

136
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,560
Can I ask you another question?

137
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:05,560
I'll go get some water.

138
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:08,560
Okay.

139
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,560
I wonder what the spirit girl has to do with you.

140
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,560
I'm sorry.

141
00:08:48,560 --> 00:08:51,560
Patrick, let's eat.

142
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:08,560
Okay.

143
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,560
I'm sorry.

144
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:08,560
I'm sorry.

145
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:39,560
I'm sorry.

146
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,560
I'm sorry.

147
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:23,560
I'm sorry.

148
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:38,560
I'm sorry.

149
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:08,560
I'm sorry.

150
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:38,560
I'm sorry.

151
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,560
What is it?

152
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:54,560
Friends.

153
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:00,560
Good morning, Ms. Sun.

154
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,560
Good morning, Mom.

155
00:13:03,560 --> 00:13:05,560
You're early.

156
00:13:05,560 --> 00:13:07,560
I just got here.

157
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:08,560
You just kicked me out.

158
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,560
Why don't you want to see me?

159
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:10,560
What are you saying?

160
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:12,560
I'm the most relieved when you're here.

161
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:17,560
I brought you your favorite jade flower.

162
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:18,560
I put it on for you.

163
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:20,560
Look, it's pretty.

164
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:24,560
Is Hong okay?

165
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:27,560
It's okay.

166
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:29,560
Shanghai's base is well-established.

167
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:31,560
Hangzhou is also very promising.

168
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:33,560
Everyone is looking forward to it.

169
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:37,560
Mom, you look good today.

170
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,560
I'm getting better.

171
00:13:41,560 --> 00:13:43,560
My brain is getting less and less important.

172
00:13:43,560 --> 00:13:44,560
It's okay.

173
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:45,560
You just have a good rest.

174
00:13:45,560 --> 00:13:48,560
Just take the medicine that Dr. Zhao gave you.

175
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:51,560
Why are you saying the same thing to him?

176
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,560
I told him.

177
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:57,560
I can't drag it like this.

178
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:00,560
Let me die.

179
00:14:01,560 --> 00:14:03,560
Mom,

180
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,560
if you're gone,

181
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:09,560
no one can be with me.

182
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,560
Mom, do you know that...

183
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,560
when Hong was doing an interview,

184
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:25,560
he couldn't stop talking about you.

185
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:27,560
He said he remembered when you were little,

186
00:14:27,560 --> 00:14:30,560
you drew and wrote homework with him.

187
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:34,560
You gave him all the achievements he could get today.

188
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,560
I read the news.

189
00:14:39,560 --> 00:14:42,560
Why did they say that about him?

190
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:47,560
It's okay.

191
00:14:47,560 --> 00:14:48,560
Don't look at those things.

192
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:49,560
It's just a temporary trend.

193
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,560
Don't look at those things that are not there.

194
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,560
Why did he fight with those kids?

195
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:57,560
He's always been a bad temper.

196
00:14:57,560 --> 00:14:59,560
He's always been a bad temper.

197
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,560
He's always been a bad temper.

198
00:15:05,560 --> 00:15:08,560
Mom, don't worry.

199
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:10,560
No matter what happens,

200
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:13,560
I'll be with him.

201
00:15:20,560 --> 00:15:23,560
Xiaowen,

202
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:27,560
I'm sorry.

203
00:15:27,560 --> 00:15:30,560
I know you love him.

204
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:32,560
But...

205
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,560
he can't give you a name.

206
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,560
I'm really sorry.

207
00:15:42,560 --> 00:15:45,560
In my heart,

208
00:15:45,560 --> 00:15:48,560
you're my daughter-in-law.

209
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:52,560
I want to thank you.

210
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:00,560
Really.

211
00:16:03,560 --> 00:16:05,560
Can you move the coffee to the front?

212
00:16:05,560 --> 00:16:06,560
This one?

213
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:07,560
Yes.

214
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,560
The chocolate one?

215
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:10,560
How about this?

216
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,560
Okay.

217
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:15,560
Hello.

218
00:16:15,560 --> 00:16:18,560
Hello.

219
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:24,560
Lily, I'm looking for you.

220
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:34,560
One coffee, please.

221
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:36,560
Thank you.

222
00:16:41,560 --> 00:16:44,560
You've already investigated me.

223
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:47,560
What else can you do on Facebook?

224
00:16:51,560 --> 00:16:54,560
What's the matter?

225
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:01,560
Do you like Li Xianhong?

226
00:17:05,560 --> 00:17:08,560
It's none of your business.

227
00:17:10,560 --> 00:17:12,560
I was thinking,

228
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:14,560
if you were there that day,

229
00:17:14,560 --> 00:17:17,560
why didn't you stop her from fighting with your classmate?

230
00:17:17,560 --> 00:17:18,560
And,

231
00:17:18,560 --> 00:17:22,560
did you know that someone was secretly taking pictures that night?

232
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,560
She's an adult now.

233
00:17:28,560 --> 00:17:32,560
Do I have to agree to anything?

234
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:37,560
If you love her, why don't you protect her?

235
00:17:42,560 --> 00:17:45,560
Do you like Xianhong?

236
00:17:46,560 --> 00:17:48,560
I knew her when I was in senior year.

237
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:51,560
I was her first job in the society.

238
00:17:51,560 --> 00:17:53,560
I've been with her for ten years.

239
00:17:53,560 --> 00:17:57,560
You haven't answered my question yet.

240
00:17:57,560 --> 00:18:00,560
I'm sorry.

241
00:18:12,560 --> 00:18:15,560
Was she with you last night?

242
00:18:22,560 --> 00:18:24,560
I'm her personal secretary.

243
00:18:24,560 --> 00:18:26,560
It's my responsibility to understand her.

244
00:18:26,560 --> 00:18:30,560
She's not the type to respect others.

245
00:18:30,560 --> 00:18:32,560
She said her mother wanted to leave,

246
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:35,560
hoping that she could respect her.

247
00:18:35,560 --> 00:18:38,560
She must have done it.

248
00:18:38,560 --> 00:18:41,560
I've told you so much.

249
00:18:42,560 --> 00:18:44,560
How long have you known each other?

250
00:18:44,560 --> 00:18:47,560
Two months? Three months?

251
00:18:47,560 --> 00:18:49,560
I'm not your rival.

252
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:53,560
I don't have a crush on her.

253
00:18:56,560 --> 00:18:59,560
I'm not her rival.

254
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:08,560
Does she know that you like her?

255
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:29,560
Thank you.

256
00:19:56,560 --> 00:20:00,560
I'm sorry.

257
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,560
Hello, official global.

258
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,560
How can I help?

259
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,560
Hi, my name is Jay.

260
00:20:32,560 --> 00:20:36,560
I'm an old friend of one of your doctors.

261
00:20:36,560 --> 00:20:39,560
Dr. Deleterious Garon Takis.

262
00:20:39,560 --> 00:20:41,560
I have his full cell phone number,

263
00:20:41,560 --> 00:20:45,560
but it seems like he doesn't use that number anymore.

264
00:20:45,560 --> 00:20:47,560
Right, let me check.

265
00:20:47,560 --> 00:20:49,560
Okay, thank you.

266
00:20:49,560 --> 00:20:51,560
Okay, thank you.

267
00:20:51,560 --> 00:20:53,560
Thank you.

268
00:20:53,560 --> 00:20:55,560
Right, let me check.

269
00:20:55,560 --> 00:20:57,560
Okay, thank you.

270
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:01,560
Hi, Jay.

271
00:21:01,560 --> 00:21:06,560
Sadly, the record states that he's no longer with us.

272
00:21:06,560 --> 00:21:10,560
He was deployed at the Kandas Trauma Center in Afghanistan

273
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,560
when an unfortunate incident occurred,

274
00:21:14,560 --> 00:21:16,560
an airstrike.

275
00:21:17,560 --> 00:21:24,560
Sorry, could you check that again for me, please?

276
00:21:25,560 --> 00:21:31,560
Jay, I'm afraid we only have one doctor by that name,

277
00:21:31,560 --> 00:21:34,560
Demetrius Garon Takis.

278
00:21:34,560 --> 00:21:42,560
Prior to Afghanistan, he served in Anchorage and Phuket, Thailand.

279
00:21:43,560 --> 00:21:46,560
I'm really sorry if he's your friend.

280
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,560
Thanks for everything.

281
00:21:54,560 --> 00:21:58,560
You know, in the Talmud it says,

282
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,560
whoever saves a life saves the whole world.

283
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,560
We'll see each other again.

284
00:22:13,560 --> 00:22:15,560
I hope so.

285
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:21,560
Take care of yourself.

286
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:36,560
I could look at that smile all day.

287
00:22:36,560 --> 00:22:39,560
Hey, man, don't you have an old lady waiting for you back home?

288
00:22:40,560 --> 00:22:42,560
Hey, Jay.

289
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,560
You okay?

290
00:22:44,560 --> 00:22:46,560
Yeah.

291
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:48,560
Just took my bed off.

292
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:50,560
You homesick?

293
00:22:50,560 --> 00:22:53,560
Nah, I'm alright.

294
00:22:54,560 --> 00:22:56,560
Cheers.

295
00:22:56,560 --> 00:22:58,560
Cheers.

296
00:22:58,560 --> 00:23:00,560
Where are you from?

297
00:23:04,560 --> 00:23:06,560
Taiwan.

298
00:23:06,560 --> 00:23:08,560
Taiwan?

299
00:23:08,560 --> 00:23:10,560
I don't know.

300
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:12,560
I don't know where that is.

301
00:23:12,560 --> 00:23:14,560
Let's go over there.

302
00:23:28,560 --> 00:23:30,560
Sorry.

303
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,560
Sorry to keep you waiting.

304
00:23:32,560 --> 00:23:34,560
I just got here.

305
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:36,560
I didn't wait long.

306
00:23:36,560 --> 00:23:39,560
The work hours during the meeting are not always good.

307
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:42,560
Especially when the hair loss is getting worse.

308
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,560
Like the recent hair loss conditions, it's really dangerous.

309
00:23:45,560 --> 00:23:47,560
You're hungry?

310
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:52,560
No, we can just eat whatever we want.

311
00:23:52,560 --> 00:23:54,560
How can we? Take it.

312
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:55,560
Where are you going?

313
00:23:55,560 --> 00:23:57,560
Just take it.

314
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,560
Hurry up.

315
00:23:59,560 --> 00:24:01,560
Yong-bae.

316
00:24:03,560 --> 00:24:05,560
You're here.

317
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,560
I haven't been here for so long.

318
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,560
Of course you have.

319
00:24:09,560 --> 00:24:11,560
Did your husband come to pick you up?

320
00:24:11,560 --> 00:24:13,560
He's been here since I was little.

321
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:15,560
What's wrong with you?

322
00:24:15,560 --> 00:24:17,560
You're so stubborn.

323
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:19,560
You're still not going to stop?

324
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:21,560
Yeah.

325
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:23,560
What do you mean? Hurry up.

326
00:24:23,560 --> 00:24:25,560
Yong-bae, have some soup.

327
00:24:25,560 --> 00:24:27,560
Okay.

328
00:24:27,560 --> 00:24:29,560
I'm going to have some too.

329
00:24:29,560 --> 00:24:31,560
Look at us.

330
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:33,560
We've been here for a few days.

331
00:24:33,560 --> 00:24:35,560
It's like this when you're in your early years.

332
00:24:35,560 --> 00:24:37,560
You're so busy.

333
00:24:37,560 --> 00:24:39,560
I don't know what you're busy with.

334
00:24:39,560 --> 00:24:41,560
What are you looking for me for?

335
00:24:41,560 --> 00:24:43,560
Nothing.

336
00:24:43,560 --> 00:24:45,560
I just want to see you.

337
00:24:45,560 --> 00:24:47,560
I can't find you, can I?

338
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,560
I can tell you're busy.

339
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,560
Hurry up.

340
00:24:51,560 --> 00:24:53,560
You're so stubborn.

341
00:24:53,560 --> 00:24:55,560
Why are you so fussy?

342
00:24:55,560 --> 00:24:57,560
Hurry up.

343
00:24:57,560 --> 00:24:59,560
This morning, the news station called me.

344
00:24:59,560 --> 00:25:01,560
They asked if I could go on their live show the day after tomorrow.

345
00:25:01,560 --> 00:25:03,560
One of the guests is Li Xian-hong.

346
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:07,560
Are you going to deal with Li Xian-hong?

347
00:25:07,560 --> 00:25:09,560
He dares to go on the show?

348
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:11,560
Maybe.

349
00:25:11,560 --> 00:25:13,560
So I want to ask you.

350
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:15,560
Do you think I should go against their generation

351
00:25:15,560 --> 00:25:17,560
or against Li Xian-hong?

352
00:25:17,560 --> 00:25:19,560
What do you want to achieve?

353
00:25:21,560 --> 00:25:23,560
I want to let everyone know

354
00:25:23,560 --> 00:25:25,560
that we young people in this generation

355
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,560
are not willing to become a loser.

356
00:25:27,560 --> 00:25:29,560
The point is, in the face of the current situation of the two sides,

357
00:25:29,560 --> 00:25:31,560
the competition we are facing is so fierce.

358
00:25:31,560 --> 00:25:33,560
The ruling party

359
00:25:33,560 --> 00:25:35,560
has lost the opportunity to have a fair competition.

360
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:41,560
I think

361
00:25:41,560 --> 00:25:43,560
you should tie Li Xian-hong

362
00:25:43,560 --> 00:25:45,560
with the ruling party.

363
00:25:45,560 --> 00:25:47,560
Isn't Zhe-Rong-Hua Group

364
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:49,560
opening a new stronghold in Shanghai?

365
00:25:49,560 --> 00:25:51,560
You can start with this as a conclusion.

366
00:25:51,560 --> 00:25:53,560
How is it?

367
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,560
Not bad.

368
00:25:55,560 --> 00:25:57,560
These financial groups have been eating up in Taiwan.

369
00:25:57,560 --> 00:25:59,560
They are shamelessly

370
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,560
planning to go to China to make money.

371
00:26:03,560 --> 00:26:05,560
Yong-bae.

372
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,560
I'll cook the pork soup.

373
00:26:07,560 --> 00:26:09,560
You young people

374
00:26:09,560 --> 00:26:11,560
are not easy to deal with.

375
00:26:11,560 --> 00:26:13,560
Hurry up and eat.

376
00:26:13,560 --> 00:26:15,560
I'll continue to cook when I'm done.

377
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:17,560
Thank you, Yong-bae.

378
00:26:17,560 --> 00:26:19,560
I'll go to the kitchen first.

379
00:26:19,560 --> 00:26:21,560
It's not hot.

380
00:26:23,560 --> 00:26:25,560
It's so sweet.

381
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:27,560
It's delicious.

382
00:26:29,560 --> 00:26:31,560
Senior Si-Jie.

383
00:26:33,560 --> 00:26:35,560
Senior Si-Jie.

384
00:26:35,560 --> 00:26:37,560
Hey, Shou-Mei.

385
00:26:37,560 --> 00:26:39,560
Have you finished reading the information I sent you?

386
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,560
Yes. But I have some questions for you.

387
00:26:41,560 --> 00:26:43,560
Please go ahead.

388
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,560
The Guai-Nai-Zhe-Gan-Shi-Zhu-Zhen-Chao

389
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,560
can compress the

390
00:26:47,560 --> 00:26:49,560
amount of nuclear waste into

391
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:51,560
more than 10,000 news.

392
00:26:51,560 --> 00:26:53,560
I checked it.

393
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:55,560
It should be fake news.

394
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:57,560
Because the nuclear waste has already been

395
00:26:57,560 --> 00:26:59,560
compressed into a little bit of news.

396
00:26:59,560 --> 00:27:01,560
At that time, it became a subjective feeling.

397
00:27:01,560 --> 00:27:03,560
The truth became clear.

398
00:27:05,560 --> 00:27:07,560
Maybe we

399
00:27:07,560 --> 00:27:09,560
always believe what we are willing to believe.

400
00:27:11,560 --> 00:27:13,560
The only way to reach the objective

401
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,560
is to

402
00:27:15,560 --> 00:27:17,560
admit your own subjective feeling.

403
00:27:19,560 --> 00:27:21,560
Listen to other voices

404
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:23,560
and cross-examine.

405
00:27:25,560 --> 00:27:27,560
However,

406
00:27:27,560 --> 00:27:29,560
an original conflict

407
00:27:31,560 --> 00:27:33,560
was started with careful arrangement.

408
00:27:35,560 --> 00:27:37,560
It proved the existence of the conflict.

409
00:27:45,560 --> 00:27:47,560
Three, two, one.

410
00:27:53,560 --> 00:27:55,560
I am Huang Li-Feng.

411
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:57,560
Welcome back to the show.

412
00:27:57,560 --> 00:27:59,560
We just talked about

413
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,560
the young generation

414
00:28:01,560 --> 00:28:03,560
who think that the five-year-old

415
00:28:03,560 --> 00:28:05,560
have taken over Taiwan's resources

416
00:28:05,560 --> 00:28:07,560
and deprived many young people of opportunities.

417
00:28:07,560 --> 00:28:09,560
What do you think about this, Mr. Lee?

418
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:11,560
How do we

419
00:28:11,560 --> 00:28:13,560
deprive them of opportunities?

420
00:28:13,560 --> 00:28:15,560
The problem is that they don't work hard.

421
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:17,560
They have to fight for it.

422
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:19,560
That's because you, the five-year-old

423
00:28:19,560 --> 00:28:21,560
are still standing in the position of decision-makers.

424
00:28:21,560 --> 00:28:23,560
How can we not?

425
00:28:23,560 --> 00:28:25,560
Mr. Lee, listen to me.

426
00:28:25,560 --> 00:28:27,560
How did you get wealth in your generation?

427
00:28:27,560 --> 00:28:29,560
By plundering.

428
00:28:29,560 --> 00:28:31,560
Yes.

429
00:28:31,560 --> 00:28:33,560
You can plunder Taiwan's natural resources

430
00:28:33,560 --> 00:28:35,560
with this cheap manpower.

431
00:28:35,560 --> 00:28:37,560
The worst thing is that the profit limit is limited.

432
00:28:37,560 --> 00:28:39,560
Okay, Mr. Lee, let me interrupt.

433
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:41,560
I think we are in a fight.

434
00:28:41,560 --> 00:28:43,560
You are right.

435
00:28:43,560 --> 00:28:45,560
The problem is that

436
00:28:45,560 --> 00:28:47,560
the young generation

437
00:28:47,560 --> 00:28:49,560
think that

438
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,560
the environment is changing.

439
00:28:51,560 --> 00:28:53,560
It's a matter of time.

440
00:28:53,560 --> 00:28:55,560
If we put our efforts

441
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,560
and talents in the society,

442
00:28:57,560 --> 00:28:59,560
there may be no competitiveness.

443
00:28:59,560 --> 00:29:01,560
But actually,

444
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,560
the young people are not worse than us

445
00:29:03,560 --> 00:29:05,560
or even better than us.

446
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:07,560
Why can't they

447
00:29:07,560 --> 00:29:09,560
like you, Mr. Lee,

448
00:29:09,560 --> 00:29:11,560
when you ask this question?

449
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:13,560
You should ask the young people in the country.

450
00:29:13,560 --> 00:29:15,560
I totally agree with what Mr. Lee said.

451
00:29:15,560 --> 00:29:17,560
In this age of intellectual explosion,

452
00:29:17,560 --> 00:29:19,560
the doctors from Liu Me and Liu Ou

453
00:29:19,560 --> 00:29:21,560
are everywhere.

454
00:29:21,560 --> 00:29:23,560
I believe that any president like Mr. Lee

455
00:29:23,560 --> 00:29:25,560
has a lot of experience

456
00:29:25,560 --> 00:29:27,560
or background.

457
00:29:27,560 --> 00:29:29,560
Even in this age,

458
00:29:29,560 --> 00:29:31,560
it may not be considered as one thing.

459
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,560
That's right. The times are really different.

460
00:29:33,560 --> 00:29:35,560
The young people in Taiwan are really hard.

461
00:29:35,560 --> 00:29:37,560
Because what you have to learn

462
00:29:37,560 --> 00:29:39,560
is the competition of the world.

463
00:29:39,560 --> 00:29:41,560
To be honest, it's really hard.

464
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:43,560
Zheng Bang, how many years ago did you come back from Jianqiao?

465
00:29:43,560 --> 00:29:45,560
What do you think?

466
00:29:45,560 --> 00:29:47,560
First of all, I want to respond to

467
00:29:47,560 --> 00:29:49,560
what Mr. Lee said earlier.

468
00:29:49,560 --> 00:29:51,560
I think the most serious problem

469
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:53,560
in this age of five-year-olds is

470
00:29:53,560 --> 00:29:55,560
that you don't want to hear

471
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
the voice of the young generation.

472
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,560
You are the ones who call them strawberries.

473
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:01,560
You are the ones who hate iron and don't make steel.

474
00:30:01,560 --> 00:30:03,560
Zheng Bang, listen to me first.

475
00:30:03,560 --> 00:30:05,560
Listen to me first.

476
00:30:05,560 --> 00:30:07,560
This is why

477
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:09,560
I'm here today.

478
00:30:09,560 --> 00:30:11,560
Isn't it?

479
00:30:11,560 --> 00:30:13,560
We are a democratic society.

480
00:30:13,560 --> 00:30:15,560
The best way to eliminate misunderstandings

481
00:30:15,560 --> 00:30:17,560
is to come up with and discuss together.

482
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:19,560
I think it's really interesting. Mr. Lee

483
00:30:19,560 --> 00:30:21,560
will now put the democratic society at the front.

484
00:30:21,560 --> 00:30:23,560
I want to ask you, when you were in China,

485
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,560
did you dare to say that?

486
00:30:25,560 --> 00:30:27,560
Do you have double standards?

487
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:29,560
How do you make the people

488
00:30:29,560 --> 00:30:31,560
happy with such standards?

489
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,560
I don't think you need to say so much.

490
00:30:33,560 --> 00:30:35,560
The point is that

491
00:30:35,560 --> 00:30:37,560
the Zhe Ren Group is occupying the national resources

492
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,560
and is going to lick the CCP.

493
00:30:39,560 --> 00:30:41,560
I'm asking you.

494
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:43,560
Do you have feelings for this land?

495
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:45,560
This land is for you.

496
00:30:45,560 --> 00:30:47,560
Do we not know

497
00:30:47,560 --> 00:30:49,560
what kind of position

498
00:30:49,560 --> 00:30:51,560
the Zhe Ren Group is behind?

499
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:53,560
What you are doing now

500
00:30:53,560 --> 00:30:55,560
is like a human being's heart.

501
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:57,560
What else is the core value?

502
00:30:57,560 --> 00:30:59,560
What is said is

503
00:30:59,560 --> 00:31:01,560
that the businessmen have no motherland.

504
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,560
Yes, I think the Zhe Ren Group

505
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:05,560
has always been

506
00:31:05,560 --> 00:31:07,560
the benchmark and model

507
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:09,560
for the cultural companies in Taiwan.

508
00:31:09,560 --> 00:31:11,560
But now

509
00:31:11,560 --> 00:31:13,560
there is such behavior and expression

510
00:31:13,560 --> 00:31:15,560
that really hurts the hearts of the Taiwanese people.

511
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:21,560
We hurt the Taiwanese people.

512
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,560
We are building

513
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,560
Chinese culture for the Taiwanese people.

514
00:31:25,560 --> 00:31:27,560
But you, as a public figure,

515
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,560
are also the cultural industry of the local companies.

516
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
But you have neglected the core

517
00:31:31,560 --> 00:31:33,560
of speech and freedom of publication.

518
00:31:33,560 --> 00:31:35,560
Because of the need and taste of the catering company,

519
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:37,560
the slogan of the cultural creation

520
00:31:37,560 --> 00:31:39,560
is actually the interests of a small number of people.

521
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,560
Mr. Li, do you want to respond?

522
00:31:43,560 --> 00:31:45,560
Okay, I won't be polite.

523
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:47,560
Yifang.

524
00:31:47,560 --> 00:31:49,560
I have some internal news here.

525
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:51,560
Look here.

526
00:31:51,560 --> 00:31:53,560
The Zhe Ren Cultural Authority

527
00:31:53,560 --> 00:31:55,560
has been operating in Taiwan for several years.

528
00:31:55,560 --> 00:31:57,560
It is no longer a secret.

529
00:31:57,560 --> 00:31:59,560
Everyone, look.

530
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:01,560
They have been

531
00:32:01,560 --> 00:32:03,560
in the Chinese market

532
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:05,560
five years ago in 2009.

533
00:32:05,560 --> 00:32:07,560
Look carefully.

534
00:32:07,560 --> 00:32:09,560
The Zhe Ren Cultural Authority

535
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:11,560
This news

536
00:32:11,560 --> 00:32:13,560
is really shocking.

537
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,560
I remember that Mr. Li

538
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,560
said in the media that

539
00:32:17,560 --> 00:32:19,560
he wanted to follow Taiwan

540
00:32:19,560 --> 00:32:21,560
to support local companies

541
00:32:21,560 --> 00:32:23,560
and create local employment opportunities.

542
00:32:23,560 --> 00:32:25,560
But I didn't expect that he said it

543
00:32:25,560 --> 00:32:27,560
and left for China.

544
00:32:27,560 --> 00:32:29,560
Li Dong, are you unable to act

545
00:32:29,560 --> 00:32:31,560
or you don't want to act anymore?

546
00:32:47,560 --> 00:32:49,560
What should we do now?

547
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:51,560
Mr. Li, you're not recording anymore, are you?

548
00:32:51,560 --> 00:32:53,560
I can't sit here.

549
00:32:53,560 --> 00:32:55,560
We can't record anymore.

550
00:32:55,560 --> 00:32:57,560
Lu Ma has left.

551
00:32:57,560 --> 00:32:59,560
He didn't want to talk to us.

552
00:32:59,560 --> 00:33:01,560
He wants to communicate with us.

553
00:33:01,560 --> 00:33:03,560
We can tell by looking at him.

554
00:33:03,560 --> 00:33:05,560
It's ridiculous.

555
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,560
But if we think about it,

556
00:33:25,560 --> 00:33:27,560
at least the chairman

557
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:29,560
is sincere in communicating

558
00:33:29,560 --> 00:33:31,560
with them face to face.

559
00:33:31,560 --> 00:33:33,560
Maybe we can find

560
00:33:33,560 --> 00:33:35,560
other companies' media...

561
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:37,560
Xiao Wei, take me to Lian Yun Street.

562
00:33:37,560 --> 00:33:39,560
Fan Haorong is at the station nearby.

563
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:41,560
Okay.

564
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:25,560
I'm sorry.

565
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:27,560
I'm sorry.

566
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:29,560
I'm sorry.

567
00:34:29,560 --> 00:34:31,560
I'm sorry.

568
00:34:31,560 --> 00:34:33,560
I'm sorry.

569
00:34:33,560 --> 00:34:35,560
I'm sorry.

570
00:34:35,560 --> 00:34:37,560
I'm sorry.

571
00:34:37,560 --> 00:34:39,560
I'm sorry.

572
00:34:39,560 --> 00:34:41,560
I'm sorry.

573
00:34:41,560 --> 00:34:43,560
I'm sorry.

574
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,560
I'm sorry.

575
00:34:45,560 --> 00:34:47,560
I'm sorry.

576
00:34:47,560 --> 00:34:49,560
I'm sorry.

577
00:34:49,560 --> 00:34:51,560
I'm sorry.

578
00:34:51,560 --> 00:34:53,560
The Jiu-er Cultural Group

579
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:55,560
has always been the symbol

580
00:34:55,560 --> 00:34:57,560
and the pioneer

581
00:34:57,560 --> 00:34:59,560
of the cultural industry in Taiwan.

582
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:01,560
But now,

583
00:35:01,560 --> 00:35:03,560
such behavior and expression

584
00:35:03,560 --> 00:35:05,560
is really like the Taiwanese.

585
00:35:05,560 --> 00:35:07,560
We hurt the Taiwanese.

586
00:35:07,560 --> 00:35:09,560
We are building

587
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:11,560
Chinese culture for the Taiwanese.

588
00:35:11,560 --> 00:35:13,560
But you, as a public figure,

589
00:35:13,560 --> 00:35:15,560
are also a cultural industry

590
00:35:15,560 --> 00:35:17,560
in the local industry.

591
00:35:17,560 --> 00:35:19,560
You neglected the core of the speech and freedom

592
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:21,560
by descending on our modifying public figure.

593
00:35:21,560 --> 00:35:29,880
You neglected our

594
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:31,880
chinese culture.

595
00:35:31,880 --> 00:35:33,880
You neglected the core of the speech and freedom.

596
00:35:33,880 --> 00:35:35,880
You neglected the core of the speech and freedom.

597
00:35:35,880 --> 00:35:37,880
But now,

598
00:35:37,880 --> 00:35:39,880
you are the god.

599
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:41,880
You are the spreak of fortune.

600
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:43,880
You promoted our culture

601
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:45,880
and ped называется our culture.

602
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:47,880
You are the proof of everyone's buildup

603
00:36:17,880 --> 00:36:19,560
does not represent the company's position.

604
00:36:19,560 --> 00:36:21,720
Please believe that our management team

605
00:36:21,720 --> 00:36:24,360
will not be affected by this public relations crisis.

606
00:36:24,360 --> 00:36:25,080
Okay.

607
00:36:25,080 --> 00:36:26,120
Okay.

608
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:29,880
Stop it.

609
00:36:29,880 --> 00:36:30,920
Stop it.

610
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:31,880
Okay.

611
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:33,800
Stop recording.

612
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:48,920
Hey.

613
00:36:50,760 --> 00:36:52,280
If you're here to care about me,

614
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,280
what will happen after I get beaten up by an egg?

615
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:56,760
Please rest assured that I'm not hurt.

616
00:36:58,360 --> 00:37:00,360
Except for the egg, it's very stinky.

617
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:19,880
Have you read this book?

618
00:37:27,480 --> 00:37:29,080
Bai Lu told me

619
00:37:30,040 --> 00:37:32,040
that this matter had nothing to do with you.

620
00:37:47,880 --> 00:37:49,880
In this show,

621
00:37:49,880 --> 00:37:52,760
we will continue to focus on the latest gossip news.

622
00:37:52,760 --> 00:37:54,520
Now, let's talk about

623
00:37:54,520 --> 00:37:56,840
the chairman of Zhe Ren Group, Li Xian Hong.

624
00:37:56,840 --> 00:37:58,040
Do you see that?

625
00:37:58,040 --> 00:38:00,040
She looks great and she's a talented person.

626
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:02,280
But the fame of Li Xian Hong

627
00:38:02,280 --> 00:38:03,880
is not a matter of one or two days.

628
00:38:03,880 --> 00:38:06,040
Let's take a look at Li Xian Hong's past.

629
00:38:06,040 --> 00:38:07,320
She's a real beauty.

630
00:38:07,320 --> 00:38:09,160
From the first female celebrity, Shen Xiao Wen,

631
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:10,600
to the anchor, Hong Li Fang,

632
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,960
and the rich second generation, Liao Ya Ru,

633
00:38:11,960 --> 00:38:13,080
to the current Lin Li Lian.

634
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:14,120
What about Wang Hong?

635
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,560
Do you feel very happy now?

636
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:16,680
I'm very happy.

637
00:38:17,320 --> 00:38:18,920
Now, look at her Facebook.

638
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:21,080
Many people have been reprimanding her.

639
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:23,720
They all say that she's a shameless woman.

640
00:38:23,720 --> 00:38:26,440
Wow, she really has been pushed by the public.

641
00:38:26,440 --> 00:38:28,600
I thought that the case was not simple.

642
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,440
Look at the revenge of women.

643
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:32,120
This time, she abandoned Li Xian Hong

644
00:38:32,120 --> 00:38:34,280
and ran back to her.

645
00:38:34,280 --> 00:38:36,280
Yes, of course.

646
00:38:36,280 --> 00:38:37,160
Do you see that?

647
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:39,240
All the audience should remember this.

648
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:40,920
At that time, Li Xian Hong

649
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:43,000
ran back to find Shen Xiao Wen.

650
00:38:43,000 --> 00:38:44,440
But Hong Li Fang

651
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:46,200
was very sad.

652
00:38:46,280 --> 00:38:47,560
She left the newsroom.

653
00:38:47,560 --> 00:38:48,760
She had two years.

654
00:38:48,760 --> 00:38:50,200
Everyone, two years.

655
00:38:50,200 --> 00:38:51,560
You can have two children.

656
00:38:51,560 --> 00:38:53,880
You can have three children.

657
00:38:53,880 --> 00:38:55,800
But no one thought that

658
00:38:55,800 --> 00:38:59,240
Li Xian Hong ran to marry Liao Ya Ru,

659
00:38:59,240 --> 00:39:01,560
the rich second generation.

660
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,240
Why did she choose to be

661
00:39:03,240 --> 00:39:04,360
a popular actress?

662
00:39:04,360 --> 00:39:05,640
Because Liao Ya Ru

663
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,160
has a great financial status

664
00:39:07,160 --> 00:39:09,080
in the South.

665
00:39:09,080 --> 00:39:11,800
But Shen Xiao Wen is not easy.

666
00:39:11,800 --> 00:39:14,280
Wang Bao Chuan was a singer for 18 years.

667
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:17,320
Shen Xiao Wen lost to Li Xian Hong for more than 20 years.

668
00:39:17,320 --> 00:39:18,920
Everyone, more than 20 years.

669
00:39:18,920 --> 00:39:20,440
She abandoned her.

670
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:22,680
How could she make such a choice?

671
00:39:22,680 --> 00:39:23,640
Although Shen Xiao Wen

672
00:39:23,640 --> 00:39:24,680
has been with Li Xian Hong

673
00:39:24,680 --> 00:39:26,200
since she started her business,

674
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:28,120
she is always a beauty.

675
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,720
Look, you can't turn a blind eye.

676
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:30,760
Who is Zheng Dong?

677
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:32,200
Zheng Dong is still Liao Ya Ru.

678
00:39:32,200 --> 00:39:35,160
So, who is the top three?

679
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,760
It's Shen Xiao Wen.

680
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:38,840
I think it's a small thing.

681
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:39,960
Maybe there will be a small five tomorrow.

682
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:40,920
Who knows?

683
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:42,040
Who is the small six?

684
00:39:42,040 --> 00:39:44,040
Guo Yi Guo.

685
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:15,880
I think it's a big deal.

686
00:40:15,880 --> 00:40:17,080
I think it's a big deal.

687
00:40:17,080 --> 00:40:18,040
I think it's a big deal.

688
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:19,080
I think it's a big deal.

689
00:40:19,080 --> 00:40:20,280
I think it's a big deal.

690
00:40:20,280 --> 00:40:21,320
I think it's a big deal.

691
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:22,440
I think it's a big deal.

692
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:23,640
I think it's a big deal.

693
00:40:23,640 --> 00:40:24,840
I think it's a big deal.

694
00:40:24,840 --> 00:40:26,040
I think it's a big deal.

695
00:40:26,040 --> 00:40:27,240
I think it's a big deal.

696
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,440
I think it's a big deal.

697
00:40:28,440 --> 00:40:29,640
I think it's a big deal.

698
00:40:29,640 --> 00:40:30,840
I think it's a big deal.

699
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,040
I think it's a big deal.

700
00:40:32,040 --> 00:40:33,240
I think it's a big deal.

701
00:40:33,240 --> 00:40:34,440
I think it's a big deal.

702
00:40:34,440 --> 00:40:35,640
I think it's a big deal.

703
00:40:35,640 --> 00:40:36,840
I think it's a big deal.

704
00:40:36,840 --> 00:40:38,040
I think it's a big deal.

705
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,240
I think it's a big deal.

706
00:40:39,240 --> 00:40:40,440
I think it's a big deal.

707
00:40:41,040 --> 00:40:44,440
Lower than shadows

708
00:40:46,040 --> 00:40:49,640
My ground is frail

709
00:40:51,640 --> 00:40:56,440
You can't stand but be very still

710
00:41:01,640 --> 00:41:04,440
All of this

711
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:07,440
All of this

712
00:41:07,440 --> 00:41:13,040
Can be yours

713
00:41:14,440 --> 00:41:17,840
If it's worth a thing

714
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,840
All of this

715
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:26,640
Can be yours

716
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:31,240
I don't have a plan

717
00:41:31,240 --> 00:41:41,040
But all that is true to my way

718
00:41:43,440 --> 00:41:47,840
This is my world

719
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:54,640
Yet I'm my world

720
00:42:01,240 --> 00:42:06,240
Yet I'm my world

721
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:11,240
Yet I'm my world

722
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:16,240
Yet I'm my world

723
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:21,240
Yet I'm my world

724
00:42:21,240 --> 00:42:26,240
Yet I'm my world

725
00:42:27,240 --> 00:42:32,240
My eyes are crystal

726
00:42:33,240 --> 00:42:38,240
The rest is just pale

727
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:44,240
My songs are riddled

728
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:49,240
It's all my own thought

729
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,240
My words

730
00:42:55,240 --> 00:42:59,240
My chest built thick walls

731
00:43:00,240 --> 00:43:04,240
To ignore that it's hollow

732
00:43:05,240 --> 00:43:10,240
My time is my own

733
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,240
And it's yours as well
