00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
Episode 2

2
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,000
All the memories in the phone are not coming back.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
It's more mysterious than the mystery of the universe.

4
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:20,000
The first love

5
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,000
The lover always believes what he wants to believe.

6
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:45,000
Most of the separation is temporary.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,000
It's just waiting for the next meeting.

8
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,000
However, the method of showing love has not been improved.

9
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
The lover is still tortured because he can't confirm his feelings.

10
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,000
The first love

11
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,000
Love or not love

12
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,000
They are all the helplessness in love.

13
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:54,000
The first love

14
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
The first love

15
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Good morning.

16
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:40,000
Morning.

17
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:42,000
Why are you up so early?

18
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:45,000
I'm going out soon, so I want to get ready early.

19
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
What did you do last night?

20
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
I went to the hospital to see my mom.

21
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,000
Are you feeling better?

22
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,000
I fell down and I couldn't control my body.

23
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,000
The condition of the uterus is getting worse.

24
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,000
I'm afraid she won't recognize me soon.

25
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Then she must be very uncomfortable.

26
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,000
So she keeps saying she doesn't want to live.

27
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:20,000
I really don't know what to do.

28
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
I believe she just doesn't want to live without dignity.

29
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
If I can't do anything like her,

30
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,000
I should make the same request.

31
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,000
So you think I should let her go?

32
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:42,000
I think if it's what she wants,

33
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,000
shouldn't you respect her?

34
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:48,000
What do you mean by that?

35
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
I'm just saying my real thoughts.

36
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
What if we're talking about your mother now?

37
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,000
Would you still say that?

38
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,000
You don't have to be so defensive.

39
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:01,000
I'm just trying to help.

40
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:04,000
And don't bring my mom into this.

41
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:10,000
Do I have to ask you?

42
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
You just said you wanted to help your mom.

43
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:14,000
I thought you were very honest.

44
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:16,000
You people are just like this.

45
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
You don't know how to be kind.

46
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:18,000
Whatever suits you.

47
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,000
She's your mother anyway.

48
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:20,000
You can do whatever you want.

49
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:22,000
Listen, you've only known me for a few months.

50
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:23,000
Do you think you know me very well?

51
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Then you've known your mother for a lifetime.

52
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,000
Do you know her very well?

53
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:27,000
What are you doing?

54
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
What do you have to do with my family?

55
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Then why didn't you come to my place?

56
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:34,000
I don't need you as much as you think.

57
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,000
I have something to do later.

58
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:38,000
Please leave if you have nothing else to do.

59
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,000
I'm sorry.

60
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,000
I have something to do later.

61
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:42,000
Please leave if you have nothing else to do.

62
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:44,000
What's the matter with you?

63
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,000
You're at home taking pictures and going online.

64
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,000
You don't want to tell me.

65
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:48,000
Say it again.

66
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,000
This is my real idea.

67
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:50,000
It's not cool to leave you like this.

68
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,000
I just don't want you to say anything that you'll regret.

69
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:00,000
Get out.

70
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,000
No.

71
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,000
I know you're here to wish me a happy birthday.

72
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,000
Happy birthday.

73
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,000
I'm sorry.

74
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:40,000
No, A'Rong has been looking for you.

75
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,000
Your phone is off.

76
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,000
The power is out.

77
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:48,000
Do you have a charger?

78
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,000
You're really something.

79
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:54,000
Why do you fight with those young people?

80
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:56,000
You don't have enough money.

81
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,000
What?

82
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
No way.

83
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:04,000
You really don't know?

84
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
What?

85
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
That guy posted your conversation online.

86
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
The internet is already out.

87
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
Is it that serious?

88
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:18,000
It's normal for an adult to have a hard time.

89
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:19,000
Come on.

90
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,000
I'm just telling you my thoughts.

91
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
Look at it yourself.

92
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,000
Have you seen them?

93
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:31,000
They'll vote for you if you come out to vote for the people's party.

94
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,000
In the past, the people's party was the only party to fight against the people's party.

95
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,000
The party was actively involved in the election.

96
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:38,000
The people's party was actively involved in the election.

97
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:40,000
Let the people's party be the main force.

98
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,000
I just heard you guys talking about the World Hall.

99
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,000
What kind of World Hall is it?

100
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We have a senior.

101
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:02,000
After he graduated from college,

102
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,000
he disappeared.

103
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:08,000
He went to third world countries to work as a volunteer.

104
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,000
Unlike us, we're still trapped in the two sides.

105
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:13,000
It's a bit out of the ordinary.

106
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:16,000
I didn't know Taiwan was already out of the third world.

107
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
President, I don't know what you mean by the third world.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,000
Let's put it this way.

109
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,000
Judging from the impact,

110
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,000
the world has superpowers like the US, Germany, Japan,

111
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,000
and the Chinese mainland and Russia.

112
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:33,000
Then there's the 17th century,

113
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:36,000
the sea power, but the UK,

114
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,000
the Netherlands, and Spain that has fallen.

115
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,000
Then there are the European countries that rose after World War II,

116
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:42,000
but they're not fast enough.

117
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,000
The rest are the third world.

118
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:47,000
But the third world is also an important market.

119
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:50,000
Look at China's investment in Africa this year.

120
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:52,000
That's right.

121
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:54,000
So the world of our market is only the market.

122
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
No, the market is an important indicator.

123
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,000
In Beijing, we're doing global business.

124
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:05,000
But in Taiwan, besides manufacturing, transportation, and construction,

125
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,000
it's not very connected to the world.

126
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,000
It's also very low-impact.

127
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:11,000
Yes, but the value of a country is not only that.

128
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:13,000
There are also the standards of people's living standards,

129
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:17,000
culture, culture, democracy, law, and sustainable indicators.

130
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,000
I think you're saying that

131
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:21,000
the young people who are working hard in Taiwan

132
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:24,000
are not working hard enough.

133
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,000
To be honest, I really don't know much about the young generation.

134
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:31,000
So, Chairman, do you think that

135
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,000
the young generation is not working hard enough

136
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,000
for the sake of 22K?

137
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,000
No, Chairman, you don't mind, right?

138
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,000
It's okay.

139
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,000
I'm not saying that you're not working hard enough.

140
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:44,000
I'm just saying that compared to our generation,

141
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:46,000
the hard work you're saying now

142
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,000
is not worth it.

143
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,000
Chairman, I'm sorry. You're drunk.

144
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,000
Don't mind.

145
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:53,000
I'm not drunk.

146
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:56,000
To be honest, you didn't create the golden age of Taiwan.

147
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:58,000
It's the last generation's economic chaos.

148
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,000
They used labor to exchange for MIT, the global supply chain.

149
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
You have the opportunity to receive education.

150
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,000
It was amazing to be a member of the foreign ministry.

151
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
You can go to foreign business if you can speak English.

152
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:12,000
You can go to college if you have a master's degree.

153
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
You can also get a promotion.

154
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:16,000
Classmate, the point is...

155
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,000
My point is that

156
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,000
now all the schools are unemployed.

157
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,000
Chinese students are starting to go to foreign business.

158
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Even if we young people

159
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:24,000
are willing to leave our hometown and go to foreign business,

160
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,000
the white-collar advantage of the past is already in vain.

161
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:27,000
I asked the chairman,

162
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,000
are we incompetent

163
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,000
or are the benefits all in vain?

164
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,000
I'm telling you,

165
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,000
this is the standard thinking of the victim.

166
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,000
You think society is unfair to you,

167
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,000
what hard work have you done?

168
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:42,000
Drinking coffee will change society.

169
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,000
Don't go into the kitchen if you're afraid of heat.

170
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,000
The keyboard at home every day

171
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,000
will not fall off successfully.

172
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:49,000
You brought the resources of Taiwan

173
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:51,000
to China and then to Taiwan.

174
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:52,000
You keep on working there.

175
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:53,000
Why did you make money?

176
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:54,000
You bought a house in the stock market.

177
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,000
We young people can't make money,

178
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
buy a house, or get married.

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:09:59,000
Don't you have anything to do with you?

180
00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:01,000
Come on, let's drink first.

181
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:03,000
I was young too.

182
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:05,000
The difficulties we are going through now

183
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:07,000
are beyond your imagination.

184
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,000
I know you have difficulties too.

185
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:10,000
But I want to say that

186
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:11,000
it's a way to solve it,

187
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:13,000
not to be a snake

188
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,000
who punishes others.

189
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,000
The successful people talk about money.

190
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:17,000
In this table,

191
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,000
the elders can talk.

192
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,000
Money is also earned by themselves.

193
00:10:21,000 --> 00:10:22,000
That's right.

194
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,000
Money and elders

195
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:24,000
don't necessarily have a relationship.

196
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,000
That's right.

197
00:10:25,000 --> 00:10:26,000
Right?

198
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,000
Let's eat first.

199
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:29,000
The president,

200
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:30,000
I want to ask you.

201
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,000
Your company has been

202
00:10:31,000 --> 00:10:33,000
transferring its focus to mainland China.

203
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:34,000
You may not know

204
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:36,000
too much about our young people in Taiwan.

205
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,000
I don't understand.

206
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,000
The small but certain,

207
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,000
the snake,

208
00:10:39,000 --> 00:10:40,000
the snake who can't eat,

209
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,000
the snake who can't eat,

210
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,000
the snake who can't eat,

211
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,000
the snake who's wh Federally vessel,

212
00:10:44,000 --> 00:11:06,900
died from your

213
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:09,800
tsching resize is

214
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,120
You should use your influence to make Taiwan rich

215
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:15,040
Open roads, democratic freedom, and a world-class partnership

216
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:17,080
You're living a peaceful life

217
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:20,520
But you're always unsatisfied and don't work hard

218
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,560
Sometimes I even feel that Taiwan is behind

219
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:27,400
You need to take some responsibility

220
00:11:39,800 --> 00:11:42,960
The world shall be yours

221
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:12,660
Shen Yi.

222
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:32,240
KID, you're here.

223
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:32,780
How is everybody?

224
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,400
Good!

225
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:34,040
Wait.

226
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:36,980
It's been so long!

227
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:38,300
Protect him.

228
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:39,160
Wow!

229
00:12:39,160 --> 00:13:00,000
The

230
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,560
Shanghai

231
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:03,720
I should be in Beijing

232
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:04,400
You're sure

233
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:04,920
Yeah

234
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:06,280
No, I'm already picking up people

235
00:13:06,280 --> 00:13:08,120
About a lot of work

236
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,880
I've been here for five years

237
00:13:09,880 --> 00:13:12,000
It's been too long

238
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:16,040
Happy birthday to you

239
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,400
Happy birthday to you

240
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:23,280
Happy birthday to you

241
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:27,400
Happy birthday to you

242
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,760
Happy birthday, Cai Yujiao

243
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:31,400
Why are you calling me by my name

244
00:13:31,400 --> 00:13:33,480
Thank you

245
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:36,760
I don't know when we'll be together again

246
00:13:36,760 --> 00:13:38,280
When is it

247
00:13:38,280 --> 00:13:40,560
I don't know if he's still in Taiwan

248
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,840
What are you talking about

249
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:43,080
You're so pessimistic

250
00:13:43,080 --> 00:13:45,160
You have to have confidence in our little brother

251
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:46,400
I have confidence in him

252
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:47,760
He's doing something

253
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:48,520
What's he doing

254
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:49,240
I like the two of them

255
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,840
It's a long story

256
00:13:50,840 --> 00:13:51,480
Very fast

257
00:13:51,480 --> 00:13:51,960
Blow the candle

258
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,720
The candle is going to wake up

259
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:53,920
I want to be noisy

260
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,400
Then I want to make a wish

261
00:13:55,400 --> 00:13:56,240
Okay, make a wish

262
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,000
The first wish is that

263
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,120
Our little brother can be elected next year

264
00:14:00,120 --> 00:14:00,800
I'm so happy

265
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,920
The first wish

266
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm so happy

267
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:07,440
The second wish is

268
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:10,280
No matter what we do next year

269
00:14:10,280 --> 00:14:12,640
We can meet like this once a year

270
00:14:12,640 --> 00:14:16,400
Good

271
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,600
Then the third wish

272
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:21,360
Good

273
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:22,120
Wait a minute

274
00:14:22,120 --> 00:14:23,240
Take a picture

275
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:25,520
Take a picture

276
00:14:25,520 --> 00:14:27,080
Take a picture

277
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:28,360
Come on

278
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:30,520
123

279
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,800
One more

280
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,000
123

281
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:34,760
Yeah

282
00:14:34,760 --> 00:14:36,240
123

283
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:38,000
Yeah

284
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:38,680
Wait a minute

285
00:14:38,680 --> 00:14:40,320
Who wants to buy a cake

286
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:41,080
A little

287
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:42,200
It's been a long time

288
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:43,160
Love you

289
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:44,760
Little

290
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:45,480
Hurry up and cut the cake

291
00:14:45,480 --> 00:14:46,200
Start

292
00:14:46,200 --> 00:14:47,400
Will you give me the key

293
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,360
Start

294
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:50,040
It looks so delicious

295
00:15:03,160 --> 00:15:03,760
Sir

296
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:06,960
Hey

297
00:15:06,960 --> 00:15:08,000
What's wrong

298
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:10,400
No, I'm here to see you

299
00:15:10,400 --> 00:15:12,680
I'm here to make up for the wine

300
00:15:12,680 --> 00:15:13,560
Come on

301
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,440
Thank you

302
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,320
Senior, are you really leaving Taiwan

303
00:15:21,320 --> 00:15:22,440
I want to go to the sea to see

304
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,160
This should be enough

305
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:30,480
Enough

306
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:32,200
it is good

307
00:15:32,200 --> 00:15:33,320
Okay

308
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:34,000
Let's go

309
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,680
Turn around and write your name on your ass

310
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:42,440
Hey

311
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,760
So cool

312
00:15:43,760 --> 00:15:45,080
That's me

313
00:15:45,080 --> 00:15:46,200
I'm so good

314
00:15:46,200 --> 00:15:47,240
I'm so good

315
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:47,880
Look

316
00:15:47,880 --> 00:15:48,760
I'm not wrong

317
00:15:48,760 --> 00:15:50,520
I'm so good

318
00:15:50,520 --> 00:15:51,600
Wait a minute

319
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:52,840
I can't see it

320
00:15:52,840 --> 00:15:53,880
I'm so good

321
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:55,240
I'm so good

322
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:56,520
I've been waiting for a long time

323
00:15:56,520 --> 00:15:57,680
No matter who I turn to

324
00:15:57,680 --> 00:15:59,400
I have to go to the sea

325
00:15:59,400 --> 00:16:01,080
I'm so good

326
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:02,680
I'm so good

327
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:04,400
I'm so good

328
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:05,920
I'm so good

329
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:07,520
Senior, it's your turn

330
00:16:07,520 --> 00:16:08,520
Why

331
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:08,840
Don't run

332
00:16:08,840 --> 00:16:09,800
I'm so good

333
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:11,040
I'm so good

334
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:12,360
Senior, you're so good

335
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:13,880
I'm so good

336
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:15,040
I'm so good

337
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:16,240
Sit down

338
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:17,840
Sit down

339
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:18,960
Come on

340
00:16:18,960 --> 00:16:20,000
Wait a minute

341
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:20,840
The one who turns the bottle

342
00:16:20,840 --> 00:16:22,000
Senior, please give him a kiss

343
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,200
Oh, my God

344
00:16:23,200 --> 00:16:24,080
Is this good

345
00:16:24,080 --> 00:16:25,760
Oh, my God

346
00:16:25,760 --> 00:16:27,120
Wait a minute

347
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:28,360
Wan Xian and Li Lian are in the middle

348
00:16:28,360 --> 00:16:28,960
No

349
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:30,040
I think it's more biased

350
00:16:30,040 --> 00:16:30,680
Li Lian is a little more

351
00:16:30,680 --> 00:16:31,240
Yes

352
00:16:31,240 --> 00:16:31,840
Come on

353
00:16:31,840 --> 00:16:33,520
Yes

354
00:16:33,520 --> 00:16:35,640
I think this situation is fair

355
00:16:35,640 --> 00:16:36,640
Both are light, okay?

356
00:16:36,640 --> 00:16:37,560
Come on

357
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:38,320
Come on

358
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,280
Come on

359
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:47,920
Senior Li Li

360
00:16:47,920 --> 00:16:48,880
You can do it

361
00:16:48,880 --> 00:16:53,280
Senior Li Li

362
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,920
Li You

363
00:16:57,920 --> 00:16:59,000
I want to kiss you

364
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:00,880
I want to kiss you

365
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:02,720
Handsome

366
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,440
Okay, then the person who turns the bottle

367
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:05,560
He will use

368
00:17:22,960 --> 00:17:24,440
Did you sleep well yesterday

369
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:26,560
The first time I lived

370
00:17:26,560 --> 00:17:28,160
So close to the sea

371
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:29,600
I'm a little reluctant to sleep

372
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,200
Sometimes I sleep alone

373
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:35,520
Staying by the sea at night

374
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,160
I naturally fall asleep when I'm in the sea

375
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:40,640
When I went to Taipei

376
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:42,720
I couldn't sleep without the company of the sea

377
00:17:45,560 --> 00:17:47,560
I've always envied the fact that I can be alone

378
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:50,200
I seem to always

379
00:17:50,200 --> 00:17:51,640
Have someone by my side

380
00:17:54,560 --> 00:17:56,400
I think

381
00:17:56,400 --> 00:17:59,080
Loneliness is an ability

382
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:01,160
Start from silence

383
00:18:02,880 --> 00:18:05,400
Otherwise, being with someone who is not close to you

384
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:08,960
You should feel more lonely

385
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,280
Now if I can go to a place

386
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:16,440
Where do you want to go most

387
00:18:18,600 --> 00:18:20,960
I can't imagine

388
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,800
Your friend is in the same place

389
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:26,000
How about you

390
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:27,160
Where do you want to go most

391
00:18:27,240 --> 00:18:29,280
Like the river

392
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:32,440
Flowing tear

393
00:18:34,040 --> 00:18:35,040
C interface

394
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:39,040
environment

395
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:42,200
Feel free

396
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:48,440
övên

397
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:57,080
the lacer

398
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:25,280
The

399
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:28,060
I can only squeeze it

400
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:32,840
Can not forget everything

401
00:19:55,280 --> 00:20:00,280
Senior, no matter where you go in the future,

402
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,280

403
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:27,980

there's a lot of good takes

406
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:53,580
i've been taking my time, yes

407
00:20:53,580 --> 00:20:56,580
But I'll have them ready by Tuesday. Is that okay?

408
00:20:58,700 --> 00:20:59,700
Okay.

409
00:20:59,700 --> 00:21:00,700
10 a.m.

410
00:21:03,780 --> 00:21:04,780
Perfect.

411
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:06,900
Alright.

412
00:21:07,260 --> 00:21:08,260
Got it.

413
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,500
Yeah.

414
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,780
Okay, I gotta go.

415
00:21:10,780 --> 00:21:11,780
Talk soon?

416
00:21:12,460 --> 00:21:13,860
Okay. Bye.

417
00:21:23,580 --> 00:21:24,580
It's been a while.

418
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:56,580
I think we haven't seen each other for four or five years.

419
00:21:57,980 --> 00:21:58,980
Really?

420
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,580
Time flies differently

421
00:22:05,580 --> 00:22:07,580
when we're at the beach.

422
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,580
It must be tough for you to be at the beach.

423
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,580
I'm fine.

424
00:22:18,580 --> 00:22:19,580
I'm fine.

425
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,580
I'm fine.

426
00:22:20,580 --> 00:22:21,580
I'm fine.

427
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,580
I'm fine.

428
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:25,580
This is my life.

429
00:22:27,580 --> 00:22:30,580
But it feels romantic to be at the beach

430
00:22:30,580 --> 00:22:32,580
and to be floating around.

431
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,580
Romantic,

432
00:22:37,580 --> 00:22:38,580
floating,

433
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,580
floating,

434
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,580
floating.

435
00:22:43,580 --> 00:22:45,580
These 48 words

436
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:47,580
are all the words of the sea.

437
00:22:53,580 --> 00:22:54,580
What about you?

438
00:22:56,580 --> 00:22:57,580
How am I?

439
00:22:57,580 --> 00:22:58,580
How are you?

440
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
I'm fine.

441
00:23:04,580 --> 00:23:05,580
Do I look bad?

442
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:21,580
Do you have a chance to go to the dove's den?

443
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,580
I don't think so.

444
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,580
Senior,

445
00:23:50,580 --> 00:23:51,580
can I take a photo of you?

446
00:23:52,580 --> 00:23:53,580
Sure.

447
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:23,580
Okay.

448
00:24:52,580 --> 00:24:54,580
I'm sorry.

449
00:25:22,580 --> 00:25:23,580
I'm sorry.

450
00:25:52,580 --> 00:25:54,580
I'm sorry.

00:26:22,580 --> 00:26:24,580
I'm sorry.

452
00:26:53,580 --> 00:26:54,580
I'm sorry.

453
00:26:54,580 --> 00:26:55,580
I'm sorry.

454
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:56,580
I'm sorry.

455
00:26:56,580 --> 00:26:57,580
I'm sorry.

456
00:26:57,580 --> 00:26:58,580
I'm sorry.

457
00:26:58,580 --> 00:26:59,580
I'm sorry.

458
00:26:59,580 --> 00:27:00,580
I'm sorry.

459
00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
I'm sorry.

460
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:02,580
I'm sorry.

461
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:03,580
I'm sorry.

462
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,580
I'm sorry.

463
00:27:04,580 --> 00:27:05,580
I'm sorry.

464
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:06,580
I'm sorry.

465
00:27:06,580 --> 00:27:07,580
I'm sorry.

466
00:27:07,580 --> 00:27:08,580
I'm sorry.

467
00:27:08,580 --> 00:27:09,580
I'm sorry.

468
00:27:09,580 --> 00:27:10,580
I'm sorry.

469
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:11,580
I'm sorry.

470
00:27:11,580 --> 00:27:12,580
I'm sorry.

471
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:13,580
I'm sorry.

472
00:27:13,580 --> 00:27:14,580
I'm sorry.

473
00:27:14,580 --> 00:27:15,580
I'm sorry.

474
00:27:15,580 --> 00:27:16,580
I'm sorry.

475
00:27:16,580 --> 00:27:17,580
I'm sorry.

476
00:27:17,580 --> 00:27:18,580
I'm sorry.

477
00:27:18,580 --> 00:27:19,580
I'm sorry.

478
00:27:19,580 --> 00:27:20,580
I'm sorry.

479
00:27:20,580 --> 00:27:21,580
I'm sorry.

480
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:22,580
I'm sorry.

481
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,580
I'm sorry.

482
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,580
I'm sorry.

483
00:27:28,580 --> 00:27:29,580
Jesus.

484
00:27:30,580 --> 00:27:31,580
I'm sorry.

485
00:27:32,580 --> 00:27:33,580
Thank you.

486
00:27:34,580 --> 00:27:35,580
Thank you.

487
00:27:36,580 --> 00:27:37,580
Thank you.

488
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,580
Thank you.

489
00:27:40,580 --> 00:27:42,580
Someone far away.

490
00:27:52,580 --> 00:27:54,580
Are you okay?

491
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:56,580
Me?

492
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:59,580
Really?

493
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:05,580
You're missing home?

494
00:28:05,580 --> 00:28:07,580
Where is home?

495
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:11,580
Come in.

496
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:07,580
Stop!

497
00:29:07,580 --> 00:29:09,580
Stop!

You're dead!

513

You're all dead!

514
00:31:49,580 --> 00:31:52,580

Don't stop.

521
00:33:50,580 --> 00:33:52,580
Any other chance?

522
00:33:52,580 --> 00:33:54,580
Let's get up.

523
00:34:19,580 --> 00:34:23,580
Hurry up.

524
00:34:29,580 --> 00:34:32,580
He's here.

525
00:34:36,580 --> 00:34:38,580
Hurry up.

526
00:34:42,580 --> 00:34:44,580
Go first, I'll try to get at her.

527
00:34:44,580 --> 00:34:47,580
Bro, don't worry, I'll be alright.

528
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:21,580
The next morning

529
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:37,580
Excuse me, the door is just opened.

530
00:35:38,580 --> 00:35:41,580
Doctor, how do you feel now?

531
00:35:41,580 --> 00:35:43,580
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

532
00:35:43,580 --> 00:35:45,580
It's okay. I'm a doctor.

533
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,580
I'm a doctor, okay?

534
00:35:49,580 --> 00:35:51,580
I'm a doctor.

535
00:35:53,580 --> 00:35:55,580
My name is Dimitris.

536
00:35:57,580 --> 00:35:59,580
Can you speak English?

537
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:05,580
You're in a medical facility in Phuket.

538
00:36:06,580 --> 00:36:07,580
Okay?

539
00:36:07,580 --> 00:36:10,580
Did you know you were in Thailand?

540
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:13,580
Okay.

541
00:36:14,580 --> 00:36:16,580
What's your name?

542
00:36:20,580 --> 00:36:21,580
What?

543
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:23,580
It's okay.

544
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,580
Take it easy.

545
00:36:27,580 --> 00:36:30,580
You've been out for a couple of days, so...

546
00:36:31,580 --> 00:36:35,580
It's normal if you feel a little confused.

547
00:36:35,580 --> 00:36:38,580
The cops have been asking questions.

548
00:36:38,580 --> 00:36:40,580
They may come by.

549
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:41,580
Just...

550
00:36:41,580 --> 00:36:44,580
They want to know what happened.

551
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:46,580
If you know who did this to you.

552
00:36:46,580 --> 00:36:47,580
Okay.

553
00:36:47,580 --> 00:36:49,580
Look at me. Look at me. Look at me.

554
00:36:49,580 --> 00:36:51,580
Look at me.

555
00:36:51,580 --> 00:36:53,580
Look at me.

556
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:58,580
I'm sorry.

557
00:36:58,580 --> 00:37:00,580
I'm sorry.

558
00:37:00,580 --> 00:37:02,580
I'm sorry.

559
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:04,580
I'm sorry.

560
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:07,580
Look at me.

561
00:37:11,580 --> 00:37:13,580
You're safe, okay?

562
00:37:14,580 --> 00:37:17,580
We're going to take care of you.

563
00:37:20,580 --> 00:37:23,580
I'll get you something for the pain, okay?

564
00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,580
Jay.

565
00:37:30,580 --> 00:37:31,580
I'm sorry.

566
00:37:32,580 --> 00:37:34,580
My name is Jay.

567
00:37:36,580 --> 00:37:38,580
Jay. Okay.

568
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:40,580
It's good.

569
00:37:42,580 --> 00:37:45,580
You can stay here as long as you need.

570
00:37:45,580 --> 00:37:47,580
It should be comfortable.

571
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:50,580
This place used to be a resort.

572
00:37:50,580 --> 00:37:54,580
The church repurposed it and turned it into a shelter.

573
00:37:54,580 --> 00:37:55,580
Here.

574
00:38:01,580 --> 00:38:02,580
Come in.

575
00:38:05,580 --> 00:38:06,580
Come in.

576
00:38:35,580 --> 00:38:37,580
Come in.

577
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:06,580
Come in.

578
00:39:35,580 --> 00:39:36,540
Okay.

579
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,540
14 sesi

580
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:43,740
362

581
00:39:43,740 --> 00:39:45,700
243

582
00:39:45,700 --> 00:39:46,940
162

583
00:39:46,940 --> 00:39:47,260
COMMUNIST

584
00:39:47,580 --> 00:39:49,580
Did you see jin dach?

585
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:51,060
Certainly.

586
00:39:51,060 --> 00:39:52,820
Just around the middle of that street.

587
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:54,660
You almost pushed me into the kojima.

588
00:39:54,660 --> 00:39:55,620
You were52跟12

589
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:59,060
I'd bring my birthday cake

590
00:39:59,060 --> 00:40:04,580
for you and bring your kerfy if you want.

591
00:40:04,580 --> 00:40:05,580
I'm about to, Mo.

592
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,980
They haven't fully recovered yet.

593
00:40:09,980 --> 00:40:11,380
They just need some fresh air.

594
00:40:15,580 --> 00:40:16,580
Anything to see?

595
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,180
Any news about Ralph?

596
00:40:21,780 --> 00:40:22,580
No.

597
00:40:23,980 --> 00:40:25,380
They're still tracking the ship.

598
00:40:26,380 --> 00:40:27,780
It should only be a bit longer.

599
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:31,780
They'd be long close to me.

600
00:40:32,780 --> 00:40:33,780
My parents,

601
00:40:34,980 --> 00:40:35,980
Ralph,

602
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,380
they'll all end up hurt.

603
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,380
Don't say that.

604
00:40:45,580 --> 00:40:46,380
Look at me.

605
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:48,380
I'm fine.

606
00:40:52,180 --> 00:40:53,180
Be careful with that.

607
00:40:53,580 --> 00:40:55,180
Yeah, well, I'll take my chances.

608
00:41:02,780 --> 00:41:03,580
Hey.

609
00:41:05,180 --> 00:41:05,780
Hello.

610
00:41:06,380 --> 00:41:06,980
Who are you?

611
00:41:06,980 --> 00:41:07,780
Good.

612
00:41:08,580 --> 00:41:09,180
Good news.

613
00:41:09,980 --> 00:41:11,780
The papers from the Thailand Supreme Court

614
00:41:11,780 --> 00:41:12,580
are out there.

615
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:14,380
They're all on the internet.

616
00:41:14,380 --> 00:41:15,780
I'll be able to get a copy of them.

617
00:41:15,780 --> 00:41:16,780
Yeah.

618
00:41:16,780 --> 00:41:17,980
I'll be able to get a copy of them.

619
00:41:17,980 --> 00:41:18,780
Oh, that's good.

620
00:41:18,780 --> 00:41:19,980
I'll be able to get a copy of them.

621
00:41:19,980 --> 00:41:20,580
Okay.

622
00:41:20,580 --> 00:41:21,180
Okay.

623
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:21,980
Okay.

624
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:22,780
Okay.

625
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,780
Okay.

626
00:41:23,780 --> 00:41:24,780
Okay.

627
00:41:24,780 --> 00:41:25,580
Okay.

628
00:41:25,580 --> 00:41:26,780
Okay.

629
00:41:26,780 --> 00:41:27,580
Okay.

630
00:41:27,580 --> 00:41:28,580
Okay.

631
00:41:28,580 --> 00:41:30,180
Okay.

632
00:41:30,180 --> 00:41:31,180
Okay.

633
00:41:31,180 --> 00:41:32,380
Thailand Supreme Court.

634
00:41:34,980 --> 00:41:36,980
You can apply for a temporary passport with that.

635
00:41:41,980 --> 00:41:42,780
Finally.

636
00:41:43,380 --> 00:41:44,380
Thank you very much.

637
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,180
How's your arm, by the way?

638
00:41:46,180 --> 00:41:48,180
Oh, much better now.

639
00:41:48,980 --> 00:41:49,980
Oh, and uh,

640
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,180
this was in your pocket when I found you.

641
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,380
I just held onto it for safekeeping.

642
00:41:58,380 --> 00:42:00,980
Now I got to hide this from Who merits facility.

643
00:42:02,380 --> 00:42:03,780
This was a huge baby.

644
00:42:04,180 --> 00:42:05,620
Lastly there's a place for me to visit.

645
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:06,780
No need.

646
00:42:11,980 --> 00:42:13,580
She looks like someone important.

647
00:42:27,380 --> 00:42:28,380
Hi.

648
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:31,780
Hi.

649
00:42:57,380 --> 00:43:02,020
My leader of Thailand's Firstу Address

650
00:43:04,220 --> 00:43:05,900
Over the past 20 years,

651
00:43:05,980 --> 00:43:08,420
we它 sacrifice up to every Taiwanese.

652
00:43:08,500 --> 00:43:10,900
We've spent thousands of dollars on publishing the files,

653
00:43:10,980 --> 00:43:12,300
and finalized with Wen created.

654
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,940
Over the years, we refurbished

655
00:43:14,020 --> 00:43:15,700
services through Die quero Idiote,

656
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:19,180
I REFER the arrangements for Japanese culture

657
00:43:19,260 --> 00:43:20,580
in Shanghai.

658
00:43:20,660 --> 00:43:21,940
Through information spread to the rest of the world,

659
00:43:22,020 --> 00:43:24,420
we hope to make window tiny

660
00:43:24,500 --> 00:43:25,540
and white like that as intellectual power

661
00:43:25,620 --> 00:43:26,060
as the biggest influence

662
00:43:26,060 --> 00:43:28,060
to expand the whole Chinese life

663
00:43:28,060 --> 00:43:30,060
and even let foreigners know

664
00:43:30,060 --> 00:43:32,060
that we are a nation that likes to read

665
00:43:32,060 --> 00:43:34,060
and we know how to live

666
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:36,060
and we have a high standard

667
00:43:36,060 --> 00:43:38,060
We can see that although Chairman Lee

668
00:43:38,060 --> 00:43:40,060
said that

669
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:42,060
the power of drive

670
00:43:42,060 --> 00:43:44,060
should come from the land

671
00:43:44,060 --> 00:43:46,060
but where does this land mean?

672
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:48,060
The awareness between generations

673
00:43:48,060 --> 00:43:50,060
is obviously quite different

674
00:43:50,060 --> 00:43:52,060
Many people think that

675
00:43:52,060 --> 00:43:54,060
Zheer Cultural Group should follow Taiwan

676
00:43:54,060 --> 00:43:56,060
but they are just

677
00:43:56,060 --> 00:43:58,060
giving up on resources

678
00:43:58,060 --> 00:44:00,060
and let Taiwanese young people get trapped

679
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,060
Let's see what the young generation on the Internet

680
00:44:02,060 --> 00:44:04,060
says

681
00:44:04,060 --> 00:44:06,060
Chairman, I heard that your company

682
00:44:06,060 --> 00:44:08,060
is focusing on the recent China Mainland project

683
00:44:08,060 --> 00:44:10,060
I feel like you don't know much about

684
00:44:10,060 --> 00:44:12,060
young people in Taiwan

685
00:44:12,060 --> 00:44:14,060
I don't understand

686
00:44:14,060 --> 00:44:16,060
Small stubbornness, can't eat

687
00:44:16,060 --> 00:44:18,060
What's the matter?

688
00:44:18,060 --> 00:44:20,060
You are hiding behind your parents

689
00:44:20,060 --> 00:44:22,060
and you are still studying

690
00:44:22,060 --> 00:44:24,060
People are going to the internet

691
00:44:24,060 --> 00:44:26,060
to protest

692
00:44:26,060 --> 00:44:28,060
I think this is a little bit of

693
00:44:28,060 --> 00:44:30,060
a construction project for Taiwan

694
00:44:30,060 --> 00:44:32,060
The speech of Lee Hsien-hong that night

695
00:44:32,060 --> 00:44:34,060
spread on the Internet

696
00:44:34,060 --> 00:44:36,060
The power of the masses

697
00:44:36,060 --> 00:44:38,060
is like the land

698
00:44:38,060 --> 00:44:40,060
that is going back to the river

699
00:44:40,060 --> 00:44:42,060
and the sea that is loyal to the people

700
00:44:44,060 --> 00:44:46,060
Between them

701
00:44:46,060 --> 00:44:48,060
is the world's new storm

702
00:44:48,060 --> 00:44:50,060
The power to decide who stays

703
00:44:50,060 --> 00:44:52,060
and who is forgotten

704
00:45:02,060 --> 00:45:04,060
The masses created it

705
00:45:04,060 --> 00:45:06,060
and can easily destroy it

706
00:45:20,060 --> 00:45:22,060
The power to decide who stays

707
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,060
and who is forgotten

708
00:45:24,060 --> 00:45:26,060
The power to decide who stays

709
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,060
and who is forgotten

710
00:45:28,060 --> 00:45:30,060
The power to decide who stays

711
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:32,060
and who is forgotten

712
00:45:32,060 --> 00:45:34,060
The power to decide who stays

713
00:45:34,060 --> 00:45:36,060
and who is forgotten

714
00:45:36,060 --> 00:45:38,060
The power to decide who stays

715
00:45:38,060 --> 00:45:40,060
and who is forgotten

716
00:45:40,060 --> 00:45:42,060
The power to decide who stays

717
00:45:42,060 --> 00:45:44,060
and who is forgotten

718
00:45:44,060 --> 00:45:46,060
The power to decide who stays

719
00:45:46,060 --> 00:45:48,060
and who is forgotten

720
00:45:48,060 --> 00:45:50,060
The power to decide who stays

721
00:45:50,060 --> 00:45:52,060
and who is forgotten

722
00:45:52,060 --> 00:45:54,060
The power to decide who stays

723
00:45:54,060 --> 00:45:56,060
and who is forgotten

724
00:45:56,060 --> 00:45:58,060
The power to decide who stays

725
00:45:58,060 --> 00:46:00,060
and who is forgotten

726
00:46:00,060 --> 00:46:02,060
The power to decide who stays

727
00:46:02,060 --> 00:46:04,060
and who is forgotten

728
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:06,060
The power to decide who stays

729
00:46:06,060 --> 00:46:08,060
and who is forgotten

730
00:46:08,060 --> 00:46:10,060
The power to decide who stays

731
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,060
and who is forgotten

732
00:46:12,060 --> 00:46:14,060
The power to decide who stays

733
00:46:14,060 --> 00:46:16,060
and who is forgotten

734
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:20,060
Time is free

735
00:46:20,060 --> 00:46:27,060
You can't stand but be very still

736
00:46:31,060 --> 00:46:36,060
All of this

737
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:44,060
can be yours

738
00:46:44,060 --> 00:46:47,060
If it's worth a thing

739
00:46:47,980 --> 00:46:55,980
All of this can be yours

740
00:46:57,540 --> 00:47:00,540
I don't have a plan

741
00:47:00,940 --> 00:47:10,340
But all I am is true to my way

742
00:47:11,340 --> 00:47:17,340
My eyes are crystal

743
00:47:17,340 --> 00:47:22,340
The rest is just pale

744
00:47:23,340 --> 00:47:28,340
My songs are riddled

745
00:47:28,340 --> 00:47:33,340
So my own thoughts

746
00:47:34,340 --> 00:47:40,340
My chest built thick walls

747
00:47:40,340 --> 00:47:45,340
To ignore that it's hollow

748
00:47:45,340 --> 00:47:51,340
My time is my own

749
00:47:51,340 --> 00:47:56,340
And it's yours as well

750
00:47:56,340 --> 00:48:13,340
All of this, all of this can be yours

751
00:48:15,340 --> 00:48:18,340
If it's worth a thing

752
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:26,340
All of this can be yours

753
00:48:28,340 --> 00:48:31,340
I don't have a plan

754
00:48:31,340 --> 00:48:41,340
But all I am is true to my way

755
00:48:42,340 --> 00:48:48,340
This is my world

756
00:48:50,340 --> 00:48:55,340
You are my world
