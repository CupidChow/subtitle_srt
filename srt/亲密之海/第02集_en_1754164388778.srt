1
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,520
I'm chocolate!

2
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:04,180
General, takes the ...

3
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,440
When I was young, love and admiration were very similar

4
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,100
You fell in love with someone

5
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:31,100
You love her,

6
00:01:31,100 --> 00:01:33,100
and you turn your moral

7
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:35,100
into your destiny.

8
00:01:37,100 --> 00:01:39,100
You love her,

9
00:01:39,100 --> 00:01:41,100
and you are willing to

10
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:43,100
live or die for your moral.

11
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,100
You love her,

12
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:49,100
and you are willing to

13
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:51,100
travel,

14
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:53,100
more than she promised.

15
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,100
But this kind of person

16
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:03,100
gave up the reason

17
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:05,100
why she was loved.

18
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,100
We can no longer

19
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:11,100
admire her.

20
00:02:11,100 --> 00:02:13,100
As if we

21
00:02:13,100 --> 00:02:15,100
were broken

22
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:17,100
from the height

23
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,100
of moral.

24
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:32,100
It's not complete.

25
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,100
Turn down a little bit.

26
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,100
Too much.

27
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:07,100
No frowning.

28
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,100
Slouching a little bit.

29
00:03:15,100 --> 00:03:17,100
Shoulder straight a little bit.

30
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:19,100
Slouch. Perfect.

31
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,100
Looking good.

32
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:28,100
No way.

33
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:34,100
What about that one?

34
00:03:34,100 --> 00:03:36,100
That one works.

35
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:38,100
That works?

36
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:40,100
That one?

37
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:42,100
Yeah, I think that's the one.

38
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:44,100
I like that one too.

39
00:03:47,100 --> 00:03:49,100
This one, perfectly serious.

40
00:03:49,100 --> 00:03:51,100
That one works, right?

41
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:53,100
I love it.

42
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,100
I love it.

43
00:03:55,100 --> 00:03:57,100
I love you.

44
00:03:57,100 --> 00:03:59,100
Baby, I'm going out.

45
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:00,100
Why?

46
00:04:00,100 --> 00:04:02,100
I'm going to ask the boss's girlfriend.

47
00:04:02,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Stephanie?

48
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,100
Oh, right. Steph. What's up?

49
00:04:06,100 --> 00:04:07,100
Steph.

50
00:04:07,100 --> 00:04:09,100
Didn't we talk about it before?

51
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,100
Don't come again.

52
00:04:10,100 --> 00:04:11,100
I know, but she even

53
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:13,100
asked you to go to work on Sunday.

54
00:04:13,100 --> 00:04:15,100
I'm jealous.

55
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:22,100
You don't need to be jealous.

56
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Those who are not

57
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,100
confident are the ones who are jealous.

58
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:29,100
Besides,

59
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,100
I'm the one who should be jealous.

60
00:04:31,100 --> 00:04:33,100
You're the senior.

61
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:48,100
No.

62
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:50,100
No.

63
00:04:50,100 --> 00:04:52,100
Geling Lan.

64
00:04:52,100 --> 00:04:53,100
What?

65
00:04:53,100 --> 00:04:55,100
Geling Lan, you're the one who's getting on my nerves.

66
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:57,100
You're so scared of the cold.

67
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:01,100
My working hours are not stable.

68
00:05:01,100 --> 00:05:03,100
Plus, I don't have that long of a leave.

69
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:05,100
I can go to such a far place.

70
00:05:05,100 --> 00:05:07,100
Go to Geling Lan.

71
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:10,100
I've never been there

72
00:05:10,100 --> 00:05:12,100
because I want to go there

73
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:14,100
with the people I love.

74
00:05:16,100 --> 00:05:18,100
Why do people I love

75
00:05:18,100 --> 00:05:21,100
not like a warmer place?

76
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:23,100
For example,

77
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:23,860
a

78
00:05:23,860 --> 00:05:25,100
or a

79
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:27,100
or a

80
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,100
You really can't stay?

81
00:05:33,100 --> 00:05:35,100
I wish I could.

82
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,100
But...

83
00:05:36,100 --> 00:05:37,100
But...

84
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:39,100
But you have to save the world.

85
00:05:41,100 --> 00:05:42,100
Isn't this the reason

86
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:44,100
why you like me?

87
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,100
One of them.

88
00:05:51,100 --> 00:05:53,100
One of them.

89
00:06:04,100 --> 00:06:06,100
Your drink.

90
00:06:10,100 --> 00:06:12,100
Why did you come today?

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:15,100
I fired that girl.

92
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:17,100
You fired her again?

93
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,100
She's too unethical.

94
00:06:19,100 --> 00:06:21,100
How is she unethical?

95
00:06:21,100 --> 00:06:24,100
Last week, she asked me to take two days off.

96
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:26,100
She said it was her grandma's funeral.

97
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:29,100
What does that have to do with being unethical?

98
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,100
This is the fourth time

99
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,100
her grandma died.

100
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,100
I'll come here

101
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,100
to help you after class.

102
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,100
No need.

103
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,100
There aren't many guests anyway.

104
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,100
What would you like to drink?

105
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:47,100
The one from last time

106
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,100
is with me.

107
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:49,100
There's also the one from last time.

108
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,100
That one is gone.

109
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:54,100
Why don't you try other flavors?

110
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,100
The taste of the non-alcoholic is more interesting.

111
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,100
I like that one.

112
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,100
Why did you change it?

113
00:06:58,100 --> 00:06:59,100
How do you know?

114
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:01,100
Maybe it's more suitable for you.

115
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:07,100
Why do I feel like you know everything?

116
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:11,100
Your girlfriend didn't come with you?

117
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:14,100
She's still busy.

118
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,100
This morning?

119
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:17,100
Yes.

120
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,100
You should go and see

121
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:22,100
what she's busy with.

122
00:07:26,100 --> 00:07:27,100
I'm going in.

123
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:32,100
Two people.

124
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:45,100
Nice.

125
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:49,100
Sorry, give me a second.

126
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:00,100
Okay, half step.

127
00:08:01,100 --> 00:08:02,100
Nice.

128
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:04,100
That's fine.

129
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:16,100
Lily, are you okay?

130
00:08:18,100 --> 00:08:20,100
Yes, perfect.

131
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:25,100
Let me see.

132
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:29,100
Just a little bit.

133
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,100
Okay.

134
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:16,100
So, want to go get dinner?

135
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:20,100
Sorry, I got to work.

136
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:28,100
It was nice working with you.

137
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:31,100
Nice working with you.

138
00:09:34,100 --> 00:09:35,100
Bye-bye.

139
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:45,100
Hi.

140
00:09:56,100 --> 00:09:57,100
Babe?

141
00:09:59,100 --> 00:10:02,100
I bought your favorite oazen.

142
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:04,100
Double egg and spicy.

143
00:10:07,100 --> 00:10:08,100
Babe?

144
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,100
Hello, babe?

145
00:10:16,100 --> 00:10:17,100
Where are you?

146
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:20,100
I'm still at the office.

147
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:22,100
You can eat dinner by yourself tonight.

148
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:24,100
Again?

149
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:25,100
It's Sunday.

150
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,100
I know. Sorry.

151
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:30,100
I'll try to get back to work as soon as possible.

152
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,100
That's it. Love you.

153
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:47,100
I think we still have some gaps in our proposal.

154
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,100
I think energy policy should be

155
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
from the construction of industrial structures,

156
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:52,100
to improve energy efficiency,

157
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,100
and to connect energy

158
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:56,100
to the multiple-task use of these methods.

159
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,100
So this is the first right-wing demand

160
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,100
or the second?

161
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,100
You think so?

162
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:02,100
I think so.

163
00:11:03,100 --> 00:11:04,100
I think so.

164
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:05,100
I think so.

165
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:06,100
I think so.

166
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,100
I think so.

167
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,100
I think so.

168
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I think so.

169
00:11:09,100 --> 00:11:10,100
I think so.

170
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,100
I think so.

171
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,100
I think so.

172
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:13,100
I think so.

173
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:16,100
Don't you think we should take a break?

174
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,100
Take a break?

175
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:22,100
Let me help you.

176
00:11:44,100 --> 00:11:45,100
I'm sorry.

177
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,100
I'm sorry.

178
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,100
I'm sorry.

179
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:48,100
I'm sorry.

180
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,100
I'm sorry.

181
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,100
I'm sorry.

182
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,100
I'm sorry.

183
00:11:51,100 --> 00:11:52,100
I'm sorry.

184
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:53,100
I'm sorry.

185
00:11:53,100 --> 00:11:54,100
I'm sorry.

186
00:11:54,100 --> 00:11:55,100
I'm sorry.

187
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,100
I'm sorry.

188
00:11:56,100 --> 00:11:57,100
I'm sorry.

189
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,100
I'm sorry.

190
00:11:58,100 --> 00:11:59,100
I'm sorry.

191
00:11:59,100 --> 00:12:00,100
I'm sorry.

192
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:01,100
I'm sorry.

193
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:02,100
I'm sorry.

194
00:12:02,100 --> 00:12:03,100
I'm sorry.

195
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,100
I'm sorry.

196
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:05,100
I'm sorry.

197
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:06,100
I'm sorry.

198
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:07,100
I'm sorry.

199
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,100
I'm sorry.

200
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,100
I'm sorry.

201
00:12:09,100 --> 00:12:10,100
I'm sorry.

202
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:11,100
I'm sorry.

203
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,100
I'm sorry.

204
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,100
What's wrong?

205
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:19,100
Men turn the wheels,

206
00:12:19,100 --> 00:12:21,100
women gaze from behind

207
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:24,100
and men dream in the dark.

208
00:12:24,100 --> 00:12:26,100
Looking straight ahead,

209
00:12:26,100 --> 00:12:29,100
the sky must be clear.

210
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:33,100
My dreams are ecstatic,

211
00:12:33,100 --> 00:12:37,100
while my heart summer.

212
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:40,100
When you're hungry, you can't sleep.

213
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:50,100
When you realize that love is a fake hate,

214
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,100
you finally realize that you are a human.

215
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:42,100
You can't live without love.

216
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:47,100
You can't live without love.

217
00:13:48,100 --> 00:13:52,100
You can't live without love.

218
00:13:53,100 --> 00:13:57,100
You can't live without love.

219
00:13:58,100 --> 00:14:02,100
You can't live without love.

220
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,100
You can't live without love.

221
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:11,100
You can't live without love.

222
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:12,100
I'm sorry.

223
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:31,100
Okay, give me the key.

224
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:34,100
I'll go visit Kei Capital.

225
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:37,100
Because of their financial planning and tax management,

226
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:39,100
they are the top of the industry.

227
00:14:40,100 --> 00:14:42,100
The market has been declining recently.

228
00:14:42,100 --> 00:14:45,100
We have to think of a countermeasure.

229
00:14:45,100 --> 00:14:48,100
It's necessary to adjust the business model.

230
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,100
I think the readers are still here.

231
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:52,100
It's just that they don't read the physical books.

232
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,100
Maybe we can consider e-books.

233
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:57,100
Or create more profits in the mall.

234
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:58,100
I've thought of some new plans.

235
00:14:58,100 --> 00:15:00,100
Maybe it can help.

236
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:03,100
I don't think these are enough.

237
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:06,100
We have to raise it in the mainland market.

238
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,100
So we can get through this.

239
00:15:09,100 --> 00:15:10,100
Okay.

240
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,100
Okay.

241
00:15:19,100 --> 00:15:21,100
I know.

242
00:15:21,100 --> 00:15:23,100
You really love books.

243
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:26,100
Changing the mentality of the book store

244
00:15:26,100 --> 00:15:28,100
must be very difficult.

245
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,100
I really miss

246
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,100
being an assistant editor.

247
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:37,100
I just have to make the books I like.

248
00:15:37,100 --> 00:15:39,100
I can contact the author I like.

249
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Unlike now,

250
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:43,100
I'm always with numbers.

251
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:45,100
I often feel

252
00:15:45,100 --> 00:15:48,100
that I'm getting further away from my original intention.

253
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:57,100
Thank you.

254
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,100
After we enter the mainland,

255
00:15:59,100 --> 00:16:02,100
I will definitely take you there.

256
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,100
Let you enjoy your food.

257
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:06,100
Okay, I know.

258
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:09,100
Goodbye.

259
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:12,100
Chairman, I...

260
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:14,100
I'll knock first.

261
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:16,100
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

262
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,100
I'm sorry.

263
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:24,100
This Qiong Qiong is really...

264
00:16:25,100 --> 00:16:27,100
Did you make an appointment with Mr. Chen's son?

265
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Aaron, right?

266
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:30,100
Yes.

267
00:16:30,100 --> 00:16:32,100
There's a Taiwanese person who is an excuse to him.

268
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:33,100
I'm more assured.

269
00:16:33,100 --> 00:16:34,100
That's right.

270
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:36,100
Mr. Chen's political and business relations are quite good.

271
00:16:36,100 --> 00:16:38,100
Do you want to go and get ready?

272
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:40,100
Don't be late.

273
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:42,100
Okay, I'm leaving first.

274
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:48,100
Chairman, Chairman.

275
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,100
Wait, wait.

276
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:51,100
I have an important thing to tell you.

277
00:16:52,100 --> 00:16:54,100
What is it?

278
00:16:58,100 --> 00:17:01,100
Do you think I can talk about business in this kind of environment?

279
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:02,100
Huh?

280
00:17:04,100 --> 00:17:06,100
I'll look for it right now.

281
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:09,100
There should be a vegetable restaurant nearby.

282
00:17:09,100 --> 00:17:11,100
It's 3.2...

283
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:13,100
Shit.

284
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,100
I've learned it.

285
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:35,100
What are you doing with the experience curator?

286
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:38,100
Okay, let's put it this way.

287
00:17:38,100 --> 00:17:40,100
Many people go to New York.

288
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:44,100
They just visit the place like Time Square and the Empire Tower.

289
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:45,100
Right?

290
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,100
But I can help you create a brand new New York experience.

291
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,100
Like if you want that mysterious feeling.

292
00:17:51,100 --> 00:17:54,100
I can take you to John Lennon's place where he was shot in the middle of the night.

293
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:57,100
I can even hire a gunner to aim at you.

294
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:59,100
Wow, that's so cool.

295
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:00,100
I know, right?

296
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:01,100
Yes.

297
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:04,100
I'll also take my clients to Europe to find some secrets.

298
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:07,100
They basically just have to pay me the planning and the hotel fees.

299
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:09,100
And I can take pictures for them.

300
00:18:10,100 --> 00:18:11,100
So...

301
00:18:11,100 --> 00:18:13,100
So it's almost the same concept as a tour guide?

302
00:18:18,100 --> 00:18:20,100
Uncle, you're right.

303
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:23,100
But the oldest skill can be replaced with the most trendy way.

304
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,100
Let's see who can think of it.

305
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:32,100
This is our college song.

306
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:02,100
It's so romantic.

307
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:04,100
So romantic.

308
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,100
It's so romantic.

309
00:19:59,100 --> 00:20:00,100
Okay.

310
00:20:00,100 --> 00:20:03,100
Let's meet again next time.

311
00:20:03,100 --> 00:20:05,100
I swear.

312
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,100
It's a wonderful night.

313
00:20:08,100 --> 00:20:10,100
That's what I call a wonderful night.

314
00:20:10,100 --> 00:20:12,100
I'm so happy.

315
00:20:12,100 --> 00:20:14,100
I'm so happy.

316
00:20:14,100 --> 00:20:16,100
I'm so happy.

317
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:18,100
I'm so happy.

318
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:20,100
I'm so happy.

319
00:20:20,100 --> 00:20:22,100
I'm so happy.

320
00:20:22,100 --> 00:20:24,100
I'm so happy.

321
00:20:24,100 --> 00:20:26,100
I'm so happy.

322
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:28,100
I'm so happy.

323
00:20:28,100 --> 00:20:30,100
I'll come back next time.

324
00:20:30,100 --> 00:20:32,100
I'll find someone to play with.

325
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,100
I'm waiting for you.

326
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Take care.

327
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Uncle, is your driver off work?

328
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:38,100
Do you want my driver to stand by?

329
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:41,100
How about I help send two girls back?

330
00:20:41,100 --> 00:20:42,100
No need.

331
00:20:42,100 --> 00:20:44,100
We can walk on our own.

332
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:45,100
Thank you, boss.

333
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,100
Thank you.

334
00:20:46,100 --> 00:20:47,100
Okay.

335
00:20:47,100 --> 00:20:48,100
Bye.

336
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:50,100
Uncle, the car is in front. Let's go.

337
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,100
Thank you.

338
00:20:51,100 --> 00:20:52,100
Thank you for your big day.

339
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:54,100
I've never seen a boss who is so handsome.

340
00:20:55,100 --> 00:20:57,100
I think uncle is cute.

341
00:20:58,100 --> 00:21:00,100
Uncle is cute.

342
00:21:01,100 --> 00:21:02,100
You can do whatever you want.

343
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:04,100
You can't make me lose my job.

344
00:21:04,100 --> 00:21:05,100
I just came back for a month.

345
00:21:05,100 --> 00:21:06,100
What can I do?

346
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,100
How many bottles do you want to drink?

347
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,100
I just want to drink today.

348
00:21:11,100 --> 00:21:12,100
Okay, enough.

349
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:13,100
I'm sorry.

350
00:21:13,100 --> 00:21:14,100
I'm sorry.

351
00:21:14,100 --> 00:21:15,100
I'm sorry.

352
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,100
I'm sorry.

353
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,100
I'm sorry.

354
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,100
I'm sorry.

355
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:19,100
I'm sorry.

356
00:21:19,100 --> 00:21:20,100
What's wrong?

357
00:21:20,100 --> 00:21:21,100
I'm sorry.

358
00:21:21,100 --> 00:21:23,100
Why did you suddenly come back?

359
00:21:23,100 --> 00:21:24,100
You disappeared suddenly like this.

360
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:26,100
We were all worried about you.

361
00:21:26,100 --> 00:21:28,100
I think you want to kill yourself.

362
00:21:28,100 --> 00:21:30,100
You think too much.

363
00:21:31,100 --> 00:21:32,100
I didn't eat, okay?

364
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:35,100
But we all thought you liked Senior Si Jie.

365
00:21:35,100 --> 00:21:38,100
But you ended up being with Ai Fei.

366
00:21:38,100 --> 00:21:42,100
I think you have a little bit of a range.

367
00:21:45,100 --> 00:21:47,100
Si Jie likes herself.

368
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:51,100
I don't want to be the one who will disturb her.

369
00:21:53,100 --> 00:21:55,100
Then can I ask you something?

370
00:21:55,100 --> 00:21:58,100
I feel that you are quite close with Ai Fei.

371
00:21:58,100 --> 00:22:00,100
Why is it that you two...

372
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:01,100
Don't keep asking me questions.

373
00:22:01,100 --> 00:22:03,100
Si Jie keeps asking me questions.

374
00:22:03,100 --> 00:22:05,100
I just want to seize the opportunity to ask.

375
00:22:06,100 --> 00:22:07,100
I wasn't here before.

376
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:09,100
I don't know who to find to eat.

377
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:12,100
Even if I'm a girl, they just come and go.

378
00:22:12,100 --> 00:22:13,100
It's annoying.

379
00:22:13,100 --> 00:22:15,100
They went to China.

380
00:22:16,100 --> 00:22:18,100
I'm really alone.

381
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:20,100
It's so boring.

382
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:22,100
You're back.

383
00:22:23,100 --> 00:22:24,100
Which side?

384
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,100
I'm so dirty.

385
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,100
It's so nice that you're back.

386
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:49,100
Hello?

387
00:22:49,100 --> 00:22:50,100
Hello?

388
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,100
Hello?

389
00:22:51,100 --> 00:22:52,100
Hello?

Hello?

396
00:22:58,100 --> 00:22:59,100
Hello?

397
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,100
Hello?

398
00:23:00,100 --> 00:23:01,100
Hello?

399
00:23:01,100 --> 00:23:02,100
Hello?

400
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:03,100
Hello?

401
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:04,100
Hello?

Hello?

408
00:23:10,100 --> 00:23:11,100
Hello?

409
00:23:11,100 --> 00:23:12,100
Hello?

410
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,100
Hello?

411
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:14,100
Hello?

412
00:23:14,100 --> 00:23:15,100
Hello?

413

Hello?

414
00:23:16,100 --> 00:23:17,100
Hello?

415
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:18,100
Hello?

416
00:23:18,100 --> 00:23:19,100
Hello?

417
00:23:19,100 --> 00:23:20,100
Hello?

418
00:23:20,100 --> 00:23:21,100
Hello?

419

Hello?

425
00:23:27,100 --> 00:23:28,100
Hello?

426
00:23:28,100 --> 00:23:29,100
Hello?

427
00:23:29,100 --> 00:23:30,100

Hello?

443
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:46,100
Hello?

444
00:23:46,100 --> 00:23:47,100
Hello?

445

Hello?

446
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:49,100
Hello?

447

Hello?

449
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:52,100
Hello?

450
00:23:52,100 --> 00:23:53,100
Hello?

451
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,100
Hello?

452
00:23:54,100 --> 00:23:55,100
Hello?

453
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,100
Hello?

454
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,100
Hello?

455
00:23:57,100 --> 00:23:58,100
Hello?

456
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,100
Hello?

457
00:23:59,100 --> 00:24:00,100
Hello?

458
00:24:00,100 --> 00:24:01,100
Hello?

459
00:24:01,100 --> 00:24:02,100
Hello?

460
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:03,100
Hello?

461
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:04,100
Hello?

462
00:24:04,100 --> 00:24:05,100
Hello?

463
00:24:05,100 --> 00:24:06,100
Hello?

464
00:24:06,100 --> 00:24:07,100
Hello?

465
00:24:07,100 --> 00:24:08,100
Hello?

466
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:09,100
Hello?

467
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:10,100
Hello?

468
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Hello?

469
00:24:11,100 --> 00:24:12,100
Hello?

470
00:24:12,100 --> 00:24:13,100
Hello?

471
00:24:13,100 --> 00:24:14,100
Hello?

472
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:15,100
Hello?

473
00:24:15,100 --> 00:24:16,100
Uncle

474
00:24:28,100 --> 00:24:29,100
Are you okay?

475
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,100
Don't be so loud

476
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
Show off your position

477
00:24:31,100 --> 00:24:32,100
It's okay

478
00:24:35,100 --> 00:24:36,100
Okay

479
00:24:40,100 --> 00:24:42,100
I saw your photos on your Facebook

480
00:24:43,100 --> 00:24:44,100
Very good

481
00:24:46,100 --> 00:24:47,100
What?

482
00:24:48,100 --> 00:24:49,100
Don't believe me?

483
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:50,100
Yes and no

484
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,100
Everyone said it was good

485
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:53,100
I want to know

486
00:24:53,100 --> 00:24:54,100
What is good

487
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:57,100
The reason I like your work is

488
00:24:58,100 --> 00:25:00,100
Whether you take portraits

489
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:02,100
Or some objects

490
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:04,100
Like a tree

491
00:25:04,100 --> 00:25:05,100
Or a chair

492
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:08,100
They all look like portrait

493
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:11,100
I feel these objects

494
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,100
In your eyes

495
00:25:12,100 --> 00:25:13,100
Not just an object

496
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:15,100
But a very deep

497
00:25:16,100 --> 00:25:17,100
Drama experience

498
00:25:19,100 --> 00:25:20,100
Very poetic

499
00:25:20,100 --> 00:25:21,100
Very romantic

500
00:25:21,100 --> 00:25:22,100
But

501
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:24,100
A little innocent

502
00:25:29,100 --> 00:25:31,100
A photographer I like

503
00:25:31,100 --> 00:25:32,100
Once said

504
00:25:33,100 --> 00:25:34,100
The photographer always takes photos

505
00:25:34,100 --> 00:25:36,100
Of what we see in others

506
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,100
Ourself

507
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:39,100
Then

508
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,100
Did I see Zhenzhen there?

509
00:25:44,100 --> 00:25:46,100
Am I so easy to be seen?

510
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:50,100
Yes and no

511
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:52,100
Cheers

512
00:25:53,100 --> 00:25:54,100
Thank you

513
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:55,100
Be careful

514
00:25:56,100 --> 00:25:57,100
Thank you

515
00:25:58,100 --> 00:25:59,100
Enjoy your coffee

516
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,100
Thank you

517
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:10,100
I've always been curious

518
00:26:10,100 --> 00:26:12,100
About the experience you mentioned last time

519
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Experience curator

520
00:26:14,100 --> 00:26:16,100
And why you want to go back to Taiwan

521
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:18,100
Actually, I can do it anywhere

522
00:26:18,100 --> 00:26:19,100
As a experience curator

523
00:26:19,100 --> 00:26:20,100
I'm currently

524
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:21,100
Wanting to develop

525
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:22,100
The secrets of Asian countries

526
00:26:23,100 --> 00:26:24,100
And many of my classmates

527
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,100
Are doing pretty well in China

528
00:26:26,100 --> 00:26:27,100
So I think

529
00:26:27,100 --> 00:26:29,100
I can go and see them later

530
00:26:30,100 --> 00:26:31,100
I'm curious about

531
00:26:31,100 --> 00:26:32,100
Those who stay in Taiwan

532
00:26:32,100 --> 00:26:34,100
Will they envy those who go to China?

533
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:37,100
Don't you think

534
00:26:37,100 --> 00:26:39,100
People always want to get what they don't have?

535
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:44,100
In which aspect?

536
00:26:45,100 --> 00:26:46,100
China's economy is so strong now

537
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:48,100
The whole world has to look at their face

538
00:26:48,100 --> 00:26:49,100
The current advantage of Taiwan

539
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,100
Should be only left

540
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,100
Democracy and freedom

541
00:26:52,100 --> 00:26:53,100
But to be honest

542
00:26:53,100 --> 00:26:54,100
Democracy and freedom for us

543
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,100
This generation

544
00:26:55,100 --> 00:26:56,100
Is as natural as air

545
00:26:56,100 --> 00:26:58,100
There is air and no money

546
00:26:58,100 --> 00:27:00,100
Life is not ideal

547
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,100
If you have experienced

548
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:03,100
Democracy and freedom

549
00:27:03,100 --> 00:27:04,100
The anti-corruption era

550
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:06,100
Maybe you will be more precious

551
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,100
In this generation

552
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:08,100
The current free space

553
00:27:08,100 --> 00:27:09,100
Then you develop in the mainland

554
00:27:09,100 --> 00:27:10,100
You don't care about

555
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:11,100
Their political system

556
00:27:12,100 --> 00:27:13,100
And you don't care about

557
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:14,100
The people over there being not free

558
00:27:14,100 --> 00:27:15,100
What can I do?

559
00:27:16,100 --> 00:27:18,100
Besides, this is a two-way street

560
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:19,100
Politics is politics

561
00:27:19,100 --> 00:27:20,100
And business is business

562
00:27:21,100 --> 00:27:22,100
And I don't think

563
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
There is anything that is not free

564
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:25,100
It sounds like

565
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,100
Fu Shide and the devil's deal

566
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:30,100
Are you scared?

567
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:39,100
Do you want me to test it for you?

568
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:41,100
Special experience

569
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:44,100
What special experience?

570
00:27:46,100 --> 00:27:47,100
How is it?

571
00:27:47,100 --> 00:27:48,100
Are you okay?

572
00:27:52,100 --> 00:27:53,100
I only have one question

573
00:27:54,100 --> 00:27:55,100
Is today the kind of occasion

574
00:27:55,100 --> 00:27:56,100
Where I can pay the bill?

575
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:14,100
Your turn

576
00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:19,100
Like this, go up

577
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,100
Yes

578
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:25,100
Don't break it

579
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:28,100
Wait a minute

580
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,100
Your back is a little bit

581
00:28:37,100 --> 00:28:39,100
You're going to kill me, aren't you?

582
00:28:40,100 --> 00:28:41,100
Too tired

583
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,100
What do you think?

584
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:45,100
I'm tired

585
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:11,100
How did the wound come from behind you?

586
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,100
I don't know

587
00:29:17,100 --> 00:29:19,100
I fell asleep in the second Christmas night

588
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:20,100
In the park in New York

589
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:26,100
Then I saw an alien appear in my dream

590
00:29:29,100 --> 00:29:30,100
What?

591
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,100
I'm serious

592
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:39,100
And he slowly walked towards me

593
00:29:42,100 --> 00:29:44,100
And asked me if I was lonely

594
00:29:45,100 --> 00:29:46,100
I didn't say anything

595
00:29:46,100 --> 00:29:47,100
But he seemed to understand

596
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:51,100
It's like a psychological exchange

597
00:29:55,100 --> 00:29:57,100
Then my whole body suddenly got hot

598
00:29:58,100 --> 00:29:59,100
Like a wound

599
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:06,100
At this time I saw an ice ship

600
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,100
I didn't even think about it

601
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:09,100
I jumped straight down

602
00:30:12,100 --> 00:30:13,100
Then I woke up

603
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:18,100
I thought it had been 20 minutes

604
00:30:18,100 --> 00:30:20,100
But it's been several hours

605
00:30:23,100 --> 00:30:25,100
Like time was stolen

606
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,100
Why don't you shoot?

607
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,100
The light is wrong

608
00:30:42,100 --> 00:30:43,100
I'm sorry

609
00:30:55,100 --> 00:30:56,100
When is the most beautiful light?

610
00:31:00,100 --> 00:31:02,100
You should ask where is the most beautiful light

611
00:31:04,100 --> 00:31:05,100
Hands

612
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,100
The tail is 83 degrees, 39 minutes

613
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:12,100
Where is that?

614
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:37,100
Where is that?

615
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,100
Where is that?

616
00:32:36,100 --> 00:32:37,100
I'm so tired

617
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:56,100
I don't know how to drive

618
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:57,100
Why do I need to sign a contract?

619
00:32:58,100 --> 00:33:00,100
I have a driver's license

620
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:01,100
Really?

621
00:33:02,100 --> 00:33:03,100
I don't know how to drive

622
00:33:03,100 --> 00:33:05,100
How do you know I won't open it?

623
00:33:05,100 --> 00:33:07,100
Li Xian Hong doesn't know.

624
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:09,100
I've been taking you for so many years.

625
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:11,100
And I still need you to sign the papers.

626
00:33:12,100 --> 00:33:14,100
There are so many things that you don't know.

627
00:33:18,100 --> 00:33:20,100
Then why are you so loyal to him?

628
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,100
You stole it from me?

629
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:29,100
I know you very well.

630
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:31,100
This is two different things.

631
00:33:32,100 --> 00:33:34,100
There are many people who know each other because they know each other.

632
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:36,100
Then I really don't know you.

633
00:33:36,100 --> 00:33:38,100
I don't know a lot of things about you.

634
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,100
I don't know where you live.

635
00:33:39,100 --> 00:33:41,100
I don't know when you were born.

636
00:33:41,100 --> 00:33:43,100
I don't know the insides of your thighs and your very sexy self.

637
00:33:52,100 --> 00:33:53,100
Are you hungry?

638
00:33:54,100 --> 00:33:55,100
A little.

639
00:33:59,100 --> 00:34:00,100
I'll give you the next one.

640
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:04,100
Go away.

641
00:34:04,100 --> 00:34:06,100
Go away.

642
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:07,100
I'm tired of you.

643
00:34:07,100 --> 00:34:09,100
Okay, I'll go make noodles.

644
00:34:11,100 --> 00:34:12,100
Patrick.

645
00:34:14,100 --> 00:34:15,100
Thank you.

646
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:33,100
The policy of non-cooperation is a must.

647
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:34,040
The legislature should speed up the approval of the

648
00:34:34,100 --> 00:34:36,100
United Nations Convention on the Rights of the People.

649
00:34:36,100 --> 00:34:37,100
Find a non-cooperation city.

650
00:34:37,100 --> 00:34:39,100
And find a place to live.

651
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:41,100
Wow, more than a thousand likes.

652
00:34:41,100 --> 00:34:43,100
It's so popular.

653
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:45,100
I'm just trying to be free.

654
00:34:45,100 --> 00:34:47,100
It's different from being popular.

655
00:34:47,100 --> 00:34:49,100
And I tell you, my followers are all very friendly.

656
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,100
The best of the best.

657
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:53,100
The best of the best is also the followers.

658
00:34:53,100 --> 00:34:55,100
They just look at you so angry.

659
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:56,100
I'm talking about the facts.

660
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,100
You're the one who's angry.

661
00:34:57,100 --> 00:34:59,100
I'm talking about the facts.

662
00:34:59,100 --> 00:35:00,100
I'm talking about the facts.

663
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:02,100
Of course you'll think what you're saying is the facts.

664
00:35:02,100 --> 00:35:04,100
You really just want to know about the nuclear power plant.

665
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:05,100
Yes.

666
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:06,100
Every time you talk about politics, you're like this.

667
00:35:06,100 --> 00:35:07,100
Every time you talk about politics, you're like this.

668
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,100
Every time you talk about politics, you're like this.

669
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,100
I think I came back just to see this.

670
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:10,100
So noisy.

671
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:12,100
Hey, let's not finish it.

672
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:13,100
Let's order first.

673
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,100
I've been watching for a long time.

674
00:35:14,100 --> 00:35:15,100
Let's watch the show.

675
00:35:15,100 --> 00:35:16,100
Let's watch the show.

676
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:20,100
I don't know why you're so persistent.

677
00:35:20,100 --> 00:35:22,100
I can take the bus, metro.

678
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:24,100
You're against my order.

679
00:35:30,100 --> 00:35:33,100
Do you think my appearance will make you embarrassed in front of your friends?

680
00:35:34,100 --> 00:35:35,100
It's not a question of whether it's embarrassing.

681
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,100
They're my friends.

682
00:35:36,100 --> 00:35:37,100
I haven't seen them for a long time.

683
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:39,100
I want to have a meal with them.

684
00:35:39,100 --> 00:35:41,100
You and them don't have any common topics.

685
00:35:42,100 --> 00:35:43,100
How come?

686
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:45,100
Don't we have a lot of topics?

687
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:51,100
Small grass, long-awaited,

688
00:35:52,100 --> 00:35:53,100
This is a dog, right?

689
00:35:55,100 --> 00:35:56,100
This is a big one.

690
00:35:56,100 --> 00:35:57,100
This is a big one.

691
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,100
Yes.

692
00:35:58,100 --> 00:35:59,100
Thank you, boss.

693
00:35:59,100 --> 00:36:00,100
Thank you.

694
00:36:23,100 --> 00:36:24,100
Did you see it wrong?

695
00:36:24,100 --> 00:36:25,100
Boss Gu sent you here.

696
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:26,100
He insisted on sending me.

697
00:36:26,100 --> 00:36:27,100
I asked him to leave.

698
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:30,100
But you've been in touch for the past two months.

699
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,100
We're just friends.

700
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,100
We're just friends.

701
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,100
Don't go back and make it like this.

702
00:36:37,100 --> 00:36:38,100
It'll be embarrassing.

703
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:39,100
What's embarrassing?

704
00:36:39,100 --> 00:36:40,100
I'm going to the bathroom later.

705
00:36:40,100 --> 00:36:41,100
Hey, Yulin.

706
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:43,100
Yulin, come here.

707
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,100
Come here.

708
00:36:44,100 --> 00:36:45,100
Why are you standing there?

709
00:36:45,100 --> 00:36:46,100
No.

710
00:36:47,100 --> 00:36:48,100
Friendship is the best.

711
00:36:49,100 --> 00:36:50,100
How many years have you been together?

712
00:36:50,100 --> 00:36:51,100
Five years? Six years?

713
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:53,100
Not that long.

714
00:36:53,100 --> 00:36:54,100
Three and a half years.

715
00:36:54,100 --> 00:36:55,100
Three and a half years.

716
00:36:55,100 --> 00:36:56,100
Three and a half years.

717
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:57,100
Are you following our group?

718
00:36:57,100 --> 00:36:58,100
Of course.

719
00:36:58,100 --> 00:36:59,100
I'm following.

720
00:36:59,100 --> 00:37:00,100
I'm following.

721
00:37:00,100 --> 00:37:01,100
I'm following.

722
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:02,100
I'm following.

723
00:37:02,100 --> 00:37:03,100
I'm following.

724
00:37:07,100 --> 00:37:08,100
Look at this.

725
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:10,100
This is disgusting.

726
00:37:10,100 --> 00:37:11,100
This is shameless.

727
00:37:11,100 --> 00:37:12,100
What kind of interview is this?

728
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,100
This is shameless.

729
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:15,100
What is this?

730
00:37:15,100 --> 00:37:16,100
You're in Taiwan,

731
00:37:16,100 --> 00:37:17,100
but you're still doing RMB in China.

732
00:37:17,100 --> 00:37:18,100
This is disgusting.

733
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
What?

734
00:37:19,100 --> 00:37:20,100
Why are you doing this?

735
00:37:20,100 --> 00:37:21,100
I'm doing this interview for this interview.

736
00:37:21,100 --> 00:37:23,100
I was just in the company.

737
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,100
And he's my boss.

738
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,100
How can I be disrespectful to him?

739
00:37:25,100 --> 00:37:26,100
This is two different things.

740
00:37:26,100 --> 00:37:27,100
Your boss is your boss.

741
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:29,100
If you do something wrong, you do something wrong.

742
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:30,100
I'm telling you,

743
00:37:30,100 --> 00:37:31,100
if you do something wrong, you'll be sued.

744
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:33,100
If I'm on the street, I'll beat him up.

745
00:37:33,100 --> 00:37:34,100
What did I do wrong?

746
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:35,100
Please ask.

747
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:37,100
It's not right to do this interview.

748
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:40,100
We have over 400 families to support.

749
00:37:40,100 --> 00:37:41,100
Please.

750
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,100
If you dare to beat him up,

751
00:37:42,100 --> 00:37:44,100
I'll beat you up.

752
00:37:44,100 --> 00:37:45,100
Don't be so polite.

753
00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:46,100
What else do you want to say?

754
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,100
Wait, I'm really proud of you.

755
00:37:47,100 --> 00:37:49,100
I think it's better to go to Beijing and earn RMB.

756
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,100
But you've been in Taiwan for ten years.

757
00:37:51,100 --> 00:37:52,100
Why don't you do it for a year?

758
00:37:52,100 --> 00:37:53,100
And you're in Taiwan.

759
00:37:53,100 --> 00:37:54,100
And you can earn RMB.

760
00:37:54,100 --> 00:37:55,100
You're now a national player.

761
00:37:55,100 --> 00:37:56,100
You can't do it.

762
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,100
And I'm telling you,

763
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,100
after the World Cup and Olympic Games,

764
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,100
Shanghai is a super international city.

765
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,100
I think the question is,

766
00:38:01,100 --> 00:38:02,100
you haven't really been there.

767
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:03,100
You haven't seen it.

768
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:05,100
I'm telling you, you've really been there once.

769
00:38:05,100 --> 00:38:07,100
You'll find that it's really different from what you think.

770
00:38:07,100 --> 00:38:08,100
I'm telling you,

771
00:38:08,100 --> 00:38:09,100
I don't have to go.

772
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:11,100
I can imagine what the situation is.

773
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:13,100
What are we reading?

774
00:38:13,100 --> 00:38:14,100
A big ship.

775
00:38:14,100 --> 00:38:15,100
What's the point?

776
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:18,100
Media value, freedom of the press.

777
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:20,100
These things are all shit in China.

778
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,100
It's really not that exaggerated.

779
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,100
It's not that exaggerated, really.

780
00:38:23,100 --> 00:38:24,100
I'm telling you,

781
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,100
you have to experience the freedom of the Chinese people

782
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,100
in person.

783
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:27,100
You'll know that.

784
00:38:27,100 --> 00:38:28,100
Don't just sit there and do nothing.

785
00:38:28,100 --> 00:38:29,100
You can't talk about it.

786
00:38:29,100 --> 00:38:30,100
You're not like Taiwan.

787
00:38:30,100 --> 00:38:33,100
Wang Daoming, they're so weak.

788
00:38:33,100 --> 00:38:35,100
You're avoiding these sensitive issues

789
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:36,100
and you're just self-criticizing.

790
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:37,100
Self-criticizing.

791
00:38:37,100 --> 00:38:39,100
That's what he's like.

792
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:41,100
Hey, I just thought about it.

793
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,100
I thought you could take a close-up shot.

794
00:38:43,100 --> 00:38:46,100
But you're as noisy as over there.

795
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,100
Who's self-criticizing?

796
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,100
My husband.

797
00:38:48,100 --> 00:38:49,100
No, no.

798
00:38:49,100 --> 00:38:50,100
Get ready.

799
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:51,100
Come on, come on.

800
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,100
The food is here.

801
00:38:52,100 --> 00:38:55,100
Let's talk about it after we finish this cup.

802
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,100
Come on, come on.

803
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:58,100
Come on.

804
00:38:58,100 --> 00:38:59,100
Cheers.

805
00:39:01,100 --> 00:39:02,100
Hey, it's a rare opportunity.

806
00:39:02,100 --> 00:39:03,100
Let's take a picture.

807
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,100
What a pity.

808
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:05,100
Senior Si Tien is not here.

809
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:06,100
He's not here.

810
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:08,100
How dare you compare yourself to Senior Si Tien?

811
00:39:08,100 --> 00:39:10,100
I'm telling you, you should just walk out.

812
00:39:10,100 --> 00:39:11,100
You're not like him.

813
00:39:11,100 --> 00:39:13,100
You're like the sun that shines on us.

814
00:39:13,100 --> 00:39:15,100
You're like the sun that shines on us.

815
00:39:16,100 --> 00:39:17,100
You're not like him.

816
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:18,100
You're not like him.

817
00:39:18,100 --> 00:39:19,100
You're not like him.

818
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:20,100
You're not like him.

819
00:39:23,100 --> 00:39:24,100
World-class.

820
00:39:24,100 --> 00:39:25,100
Let's take a picture.

821
00:39:25,100 --> 00:39:26,100
Let's take a picture.

822
00:39:26,100 --> 00:39:27,100
I think I know.

823
00:39:27,100 --> 00:39:28,100
Come on, let's take a picture.

824
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,100
World-class.

825
00:39:29,100 --> 00:39:31,100
One, two, three.

826
00:39:31,100 --> 00:39:34,100
World-class.

827
00:39:35,100 --> 00:39:36,100
What's this?

828
00:39:36,100 --> 00:39:38,100
What's the world-class?

829
00:39:38,100 --> 00:39:39,100
Just check the photos.

830
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:41,100
Okay, I'll check it.

831
00:39:41,100 --> 00:39:42,100
Okay, come on.

832
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:44,100
Boss, why are you here?

833
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,100
Let me introduce you.

834
00:39:51,100 --> 00:39:53,100
This is my boss, Mr. Li Xian Hong.

835
00:39:53,100 --> 00:39:54,100
I think everyone knows him.

836
00:39:54,100 --> 00:39:55,100
Hello, everyone.

837
00:39:55,100 --> 00:39:56,100
Hello.

838
00:39:56,100 --> 00:39:57,100
These are my college classmates.

839
00:39:57,100 --> 00:39:59,100
They usually work in the mainland.

840
00:39:59,100 --> 00:40:02,100
And Su Mei works in the legal department.

841
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,100
And Zhan Fu is studying law now.

842
00:40:05,100 --> 00:40:07,100
Li Dian, have you met before?

843
00:40:08,100 --> 00:40:09,100
Have you eaten yet?

844
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:10,100
No.

845
00:40:10,100 --> 00:40:11,100
You guys eat together.

846
00:40:11,100 --> 00:40:12,100
Yes.

847
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,100
If you want to eat together.

848
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:14,100
Of course.

849
00:40:14,100 --> 00:40:15,100
Welcome.

850
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,100
Come on, boss.

851
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,100
Come on.

852
00:40:17,100 --> 00:40:18,100
Boss, sit over there.

853
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,100
Okay.

854
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:21,100
That's it.

855
00:40:21,100 --> 00:40:22,100
I'm here to treat you today.

856
00:40:22,100 --> 00:40:23,100
You can order as much as you want.

857
00:40:23,100 --> 00:40:25,100
Thank you.

858
00:40:25,100 --> 00:40:26,100
Thank you, boss.

859
00:40:26,100 --> 00:40:28,100
What do you want to eat next door?

860
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:29,100
No problem.

861
00:40:29,100 --> 00:40:30,100
Mr. Li.

862
00:40:30,100 --> 00:40:33,100
I saw your interview notice on the news.

863
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:35,100
I didn't expect to have dinner with you now.

864
00:40:35,100 --> 00:40:37,100
It's a blessing for me.

865
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,100
Yes.

866
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,100
Thank you.

867
00:40:40,100 --> 00:40:43,100
Times are a new class concept.

868
00:40:43,100 --> 00:40:46,100
The picky is a common style.

869
00:40:46,100 --> 00:40:49,100
It's a kind of arrogance that has no power.

870
00:40:49,100 --> 00:41:03,680
Facing a

871
00:41:13,100 --> 00:41:18,100
《My Night》

872
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:31,100
My night is long

873
00:41:33,100 --> 00:41:36,100
Longer than most

874
00:41:38,100 --> 00:41:41,100
My day is short

875
00:41:43,100 --> 00:41:46,100
Shorter than ice melt

876
00:41:50,100 --> 00:41:53,100
My height is slow

877
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:58,100
Lower than shadows

878
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:04,100
My ground is frail

879
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,100
You can't stand but be very still

880
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,100
All of this

881
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:18,100
All of this

882
00:42:18,100 --> 00:42:22,100
Can be yours

883
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,100
If it's worth a thing

884
00:42:29,100 --> 00:42:31,100
All of this

885
00:42:31,100 --> 00:42:34,100
Can be yours

886
00:42:38,100 --> 00:42:41,100
I don't know how to say it

887
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:45,100
I don't have a plan

888
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:48,100
But all I am

889
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:54,100
Is true to my word

890
00:42:58,100 --> 00:43:02,100
My eyes are crystal

891
00:43:04,100 --> 00:43:07,100
The rest is just pale

892
00:43:08,100 --> 00:43:12,100
My songs are riddled

893
00:43:14,100 --> 00:43:17,100
So are my own thoughts

894
00:43:21,100 --> 00:43:25,100
My chest built thick walls

895
00:43:26,100 --> 00:43:30,100
To ignore that it's hollow

896
00:43:31,100 --> 00:43:36,100
My time is my own

897
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,100
And it's yours as well

898
00:43:47,100 --> 00:43:50,100
All of this

899
00:43:51,100 --> 00:43:53,100
All of this

900
00:43:53,100 --> 00:43:58,100
Can be yours

901
00:44:00,100 --> 00:44:03,100
If it's worth a thing

902
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,100
All of this

903
00:44:06,100 --> 00:44:09,100
Can be yours

904
00:44:13,100 --> 00:44:16,100
I don't have a plan

905
00:44:16,100 --> 00:44:19,100
But all I am

906
00:44:19,100 --> 00:44:25,100
Is true to my word

907
00:44:25,100 --> 00:44:30,100
This is my world

908
00:44:32,100 --> 00:44:35,100
You are my world
