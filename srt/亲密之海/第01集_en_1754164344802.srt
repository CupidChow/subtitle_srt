00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,000
The End

2
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,000
Where should I start?

3
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:26,000
The story can start from any point.

4
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
For example,

5
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:34,000
starting from me.

6
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,000
We are all alone on this vast, shadowless island in the sea.

7
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
This island,

8
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,000
which looks like a remote island,

9
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,000
is located on the surface of the sea.

10
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Under the deep sea,

11
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
we are together.

12
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
However,

13
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:21,000
there are still places in this world that cannot be reached by the internet.

14
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
For example,

15
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
the heart of a lover.

16
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,000
The heart of a lover.

17
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
The heart of a lover.

18
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
Hard-ative man

19
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,860
Take a cold shower

20
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:26,580
and wipe salt with the bottom of the container

21
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:36,700
totke як

22
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:41,400
brush salt

23
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,400
to increase

24
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,000
What's wrong with this thing.

25
00:03:01,720 --> 00:03:03,160
Put in the refrigerator

26
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:10,040
Put in the refrigerator

27
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:16,400
Director Luo

28
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:17,300
Director Guan

29
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,220

30
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:22,560

00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:45,200
Hi

41
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:50,040
Yes, the boss is busy

42
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,740
Aah...

43
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,880
Good morning, Xiong

44
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,080
Good morning, Jiong

45
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:01,700
How was your interview session?

46
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,740
I did the work Jobs

47
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:04,480
came straight to the workshop

48
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:07,240
Hong Li Fang

49
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:09,560
Oh, Alsace. She's putting makeup inside

50
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:12,080
She's so slow

51
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:14,360
I'm gonna have a look

52
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:17,880
Brother Rong, I started walking since last night.

53
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:20,360
Are you that serious? Do you want to give me a thumbs up?

54
00:04:20,360 --> 00:04:23,000
I'll ask you one question and you answer ten questions.

55
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,560
Hello.

56
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:27,240
Hello, everyone.

57
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,400
Thank you for coming.

58
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:31,480
Thank you.

59
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,320
Qiong, where's the chair?

60
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:35,120
The chair is here.

61
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:37,480
Brother Rong,

62
00:04:37,480 --> 00:04:40,120
TFF sent an invitation to the chairman.

63
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:43,400
They have an art exhibition next month from the 1st to the 5th.

64
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,560
The chairman wasn't here last month. He's still in the mainland.

65
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,200
But he has some paintings he's interested in. I'll contact him.

66
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:50,760
Where is he? Is he in the office?

67
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:51,920
He's not here yet.

68
00:04:51,920 --> 00:04:53,280
He's not here yet?

69
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,880
He said he would be here early today.

70
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:57,040
Oh, right.

71
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,280
What's wrong?

72
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:01,560
Nothing. I'm thinking if it's related to last night's dinner.

73
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,400
What happened last night?

74
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:05,000
Nothing. Nothing.

75
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,440
I'll call the chairman first.

76
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:08,480
I'm already calling him. I'm going to the scene.

77
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:11,520
Okay. Brother Rong, leave it to me. No problem.

78
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:15,000
Hello, Yifang.

79
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:16,960
I'm sorry to say this.

80
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,680
The chairman is a little bit busy. Please wait a little bit longer.

81
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:20,520
Long time no see, Rong.

82
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:22,920
I think I have to call you the special assistant now.

83
00:05:22,920 --> 00:05:25,000
Just keep calling me Rong.

84
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,680
It's been two years since we last met.

85
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:28,600
We met at Patrick's place last time.

86
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:29,920
And your boss.

87
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:31,000
Four years.

88
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,360
Four years... That's a long time.

89
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:36,680
I've been calling him Rong for two years.

90
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:39,680
I've been calling him Rong for two years.

91
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:41,400
I'm sorry.

92
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:42,400
It's been so long.

93
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:44,400
Hey, Manager.

94
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,400
Let me introduce you.

95
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
I'm the host of Hong Li Fang.

96
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,400
Hello, host.

97
00:05:47,400 --> 00:05:48,400
Long time no see.

98
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,400
You're younger and prettier than the TV.

99
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,400
You're too polite, Xiao Wen.

100
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,400
I'm glad to hear that.

101
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:55,400
Manager Li Fang,

102
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:56,400
in order to welcome you,

103
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,400
I came back from the mainland one day earlier.

104
00:05:58,400 --> 00:05:59,400
Am I that famous?

105
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:00,400
How can I be so shy?

106
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:01,400
So, please be kind to him

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:03,400
during the interview later.

108
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:04,400
I'm a nice person.

109
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,400
So, is he still on the way?

110
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:08,400
I don't know.

111
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:11,400
How about we go to the conference room to wait for him?

112
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:12,400
Of course.

113
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:13,400
Come on, please.

114
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:14,400
Congratulations.

115
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:15,400
He's been a great host these two years.

116
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:16,400
He's quite capable.

117
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:18,400
Yes, he's a good host.

118
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:20,400
He's planning the company's future.

119
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:22,400
I hope he'll have you in his future.

120
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,400
Are you kidding me?

121
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:25,400
I'm just a fast talker.

122
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:26,400
It's okay.

123
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
I like your hosting style.

124
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
It's very professional.

125
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:34,400
Cheng Xiao.

126
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:37,400
Tell me.

127
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:38,400
What happened last night?

128
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:40,400
Nothing.

129
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:41,400
Anyway, you don't have to worry about me.

130
00:06:41,400 --> 00:06:43,400
He didn't answer my call.

131
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:45,400
The chairman is here.

132
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,400
Chairman.

133
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:49,400
You scared me.

134
00:06:49,400 --> 00:06:50,400
Why are you here now?

135
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:51,400
I'm fine.

136
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,400
What's wrong with me?

137
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:54,400
You drank too much last night.

138
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:55,400
Nothing.

139
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:57,400
I just asked you to see my colleagues for dinner.

140
00:06:57,400 --> 00:06:58,400
I see.

141
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,400
Our host is waiting in the conference room.

142
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:03,400
Do you want to change your clothes?

143
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,400
No.

144
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:05,400
Or should I help you clean up?

145
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:06,400
No, thanks.

146
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:07,400
It's okay.

147
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:10,400
Li Fang.

148
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,400
Li Xian Hong.

149
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:14,400
I'll be waiting.

150
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,400
Sorry.

151
00:07:15,400 --> 00:07:16,400
I'll treat you to dinner.

152
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:18,400
What did you say four years ago?

153
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:20,400
It's my fault.

154
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,400
How about this?

155
00:07:21,400 --> 00:07:23,400
Let's meet at Patrick's house.

156
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,400
You like his dishes, right?

157
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,400
What?

158
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:27,400
Are you afraid I'll eat you?

159
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:29,400
You're still talking like a man.

160
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:30,400
You're so unreasonable.

161
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:32,400
Okay, let's get ready.

162
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,400
Five, four, three, two.

163
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,400
Hello, everyone.

164
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,400
Welcome to the Three-Channel.

165
00:07:39,400 --> 00:07:40,400
I'm Hong Li Fang.

166
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:41,400
Today's guest is

167
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:42,400
the chairman of Zhe'er Cultural Group,

168
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,400
which is very innovative in both sides.

169
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:45,400
Mr. Li Xian Hong.

170
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:47,400
There's a rumor recently

171
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:48,400
that China is very interested

172
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,400
in your cultural and creative industries.

173
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:53,400
Both sides are actively discussing

174
00:07:53,400 --> 00:07:54,400
the possibility of future cooperation.

175
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,400
So we want to ask Mr. Li to talk to us

176
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,400
about the future of the Chinese army's vision

177
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:01,400
and the differences in cultural and commercial affairs.

178
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:04,400
In the past 20 years,

179
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:05,400
we've been able to support

180
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,400
every Taiwanese.

181
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:08,400
We've resumed our business

182
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:09,400
and went all the way to the bookstore

183
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,400
to combine cultural and commercial industries.

184
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:12,400
Now we're planning

185
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:14,400
projects in mainland China.

186
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,400
I think

187
00:08:15,400 --> 00:08:17,400
we Taiwanese value and value

188
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,400
culture in the entire Chinese world.

189
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:20,400
Yes.

190
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,400
So we hope

191
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:22,400
that the power of culture

192
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,400
can have the greatest influence

193
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:24,400
on the entire Chinese living environment

194
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,400
and even make foreigners know

195
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:28,400
that we're a

196
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:30,400
rich and educated nation.

197
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:31,400
My first girlfriend,

198
00:08:31,400 --> 00:08:32,400
to be more precise,

199
00:08:33,400 --> 00:08:34,400
is a single-lover.

200
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:38,400
I want to share

201
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:40,400
a philosopher's words with you.

202
00:08:40,400 --> 00:08:42,400
Have you ever heard of him?

203
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:44,400
He said

204
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:45,400
that if a person knows

205
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:47,400
why he lives,

206
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:48,400
he can endure

207
00:08:48,400 --> 00:08:50,400
any kind of life.

208
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:51,400
As long as he knows

209
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:53,400
what is the most important thing in life,

210
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:55,400
no difficulty

211
00:08:55,400 --> 00:08:57,400
can stop him.

212
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,400
Not only that,

213
00:08:58,400 --> 00:08:59,400
but also the world.

214
00:08:59,400 --> 00:09:01,400
I believe that

215
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:02,400
as long as you pursue your dream

216
00:09:02,400 --> 00:09:04,400
in the air of freedom,

217
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:05,400
the world will always

218
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:07,400
open the door for you.

219
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:09,400
Now,

220
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:11,400
university is the most important thing

221
00:09:11,400 --> 00:09:12,400
for you.

222
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:14,400
But after you go to college,

223
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:15,400
you may want to

224
00:09:15,400 --> 00:09:17,400
have a good relationship.

225
00:09:17,400 --> 00:09:19,400
I was like that

226
00:09:19,400 --> 00:09:20,400
that day.

227
00:09:20,400 --> 00:09:21,400
But I've been through

228
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:22,400
the pandemic.

229
00:09:22,400 --> 00:09:23,400
I know that

230
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:25,400
there is no freedom

231
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,400
without the help of

232
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,400
the people.

233
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:28,400
What is the wisdom

234
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:29,400
of being forbidden?

235
00:09:30,400 --> 00:09:31,400
Maybe in the future,

236
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:32,400
you will experience

237
00:09:32,400 --> 00:09:33,400
what is called death.

238
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:35,400
You will understand

239
00:09:35,400 --> 00:09:37,400
what is most important to you.

240
00:09:40,400 --> 00:09:41,400
On the summer vacation

241
00:09:41,400 --> 00:09:43,400
when I graduated from high school,

242
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:44,400
I finished reading

243
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:45,400
all the books

244
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,400
that I had written.

245
00:09:49,400 --> 00:09:50,400
I also filled in

246
00:09:50,400 --> 00:09:52,400
my homework on the first month.

247
00:09:56,400 --> 00:09:57,400
Does he need

248
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,400
a research fee recently?

249
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Tell him

250
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:02,400
that he doesn't have to worry

251
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:03,400
about the research fee.

252
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,400
We will take care of it.

253
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:05,400
Thank you.

254
00:10:11,400 --> 00:10:12,400
You are really great.

255
00:10:12,400 --> 00:10:14,400
I was about to eat egg fried rice,

256
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:15,400
but you appeared.

257
00:10:16,400 --> 00:10:17,400
I know that

258
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,400
you like it.

259
00:10:18,400 --> 00:10:19,400
Although it is not as good

260
00:10:19,400 --> 00:10:20,400
as your cooking skills,

261
00:10:20,400 --> 00:10:21,400
you can still

262
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:22,400
take it into consideration.

263
00:10:22,400 --> 00:10:24,400
To be honest,

264
00:10:24,400 --> 00:10:25,400
I really miss

265
00:10:25,400 --> 00:10:26,400
your taste.

266
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:27,400
Look,

267
00:10:28,400 --> 00:10:29,400
your cooking skills are good.

268
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,400
The rice is clearly separated.

269
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:32,400
Each grain of rice has its own appearance.

270
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:33,400
You must wrap the egg.

271
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:36,400
I remember you saying that.

272
00:10:36,400 --> 00:10:37,400
So I tried many restaurants.

273
00:10:37,400 --> 00:10:38,400
This restaurant is good.

274
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:39,400
You should try it.

275
00:10:41,400 --> 00:10:42,400
You really know how to do it.

276
00:10:56,400 --> 00:10:57,400
By the way, boss,

277
00:10:58,400 --> 00:10:59,400
I mentioned to you last time

278
00:10:59,400 --> 00:11:00,400
that I will open

279
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:01,400
an account on Facebook.

280
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:02,400
I don't know if you have

281
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,400
ever thought about it.

282
00:11:03,400 --> 00:11:04,400
I have told you.

283
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:05,400
I am not interested

284
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,400
in the Internet.

285
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:10,400
But boss,

286
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,400
Facebook is really popular

287
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:12,400
these two years.

288
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:13,400
Many companies have opened

289
00:11:13,400 --> 00:11:14,400
accounts.

290
00:11:14,400 --> 00:11:15,400
And they all

291
00:11:15,400 --> 00:11:16,400
treat Facebook

292
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:17,400
as the main media.

293
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:18,400
Plus, our audience

294
00:11:18,400 --> 00:11:19,400
are young people.

295
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:20,400
It's good that I have you.

296
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:22,400
Let me tell you.

297
00:11:22,400 --> 00:11:23,400
I have a lot of friends

298
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,400
I am telling you.

299
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:27,400
You can handle the Internet.

300
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:28,400
I am very relieved.

301
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:32,400
Yes.

302
00:11:35,400 --> 00:11:36,400
But to be honest,

303
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:37,400
if I really

304
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,400
register Facebook one day,

305
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,400
it means

306
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:41,400
you have been replaced.

307
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:50,400
I am kidding.

308
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:54,400
Yes.

309
00:11:57,400 --> 00:11:58,400
Senior.

310
00:11:59,400 --> 00:12:00,400
Patrick.

311
00:12:00,400 --> 00:12:01,400
What brings you here?

312
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:02,400
I must be the one

313
00:12:02,400 --> 00:12:03,400
who brings you here.

314
00:12:04,400 --> 00:12:06,400
Wow, it's good.

315
00:12:07,400 --> 00:12:08,400
Rong.

316
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,400
Patrick.

317
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:11,400
Hello.

318
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:12,400
Don't say hello.

319
00:12:12,400 --> 00:12:13,400
I am not as old as him.

320
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:15,400
My college student

321
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:16,400
studied in England.

322
00:12:16,400 --> 00:12:17,400
He is a master's student.

323
00:12:17,400 --> 00:12:18,400
He is also a member

324
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:19,400
of the Ye Bai and Xue Yun.

325
00:12:19,400 --> 00:12:20,400
Why are you

326
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,400
telling these to the kids?

327
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:22,400
What?

328
00:12:22,400 --> 00:12:23,400
You are already eating.

329
00:12:23,400 --> 00:12:25,400
I wanted to have dinner with you.

330
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,400
Rong is very considerate.

331
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:27,400
He brought me food I like.

332
00:12:28,400 --> 00:12:29,400
Let me tell you.

333
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,400
Patrick is very good at cooking.

334
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,400
When we were in college,

335
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,400
we often cooked for him.

336
00:12:34,400 --> 00:12:35,400
What are you doing?

337
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,400
What are you eating?

338
00:12:36,400 --> 00:12:37,400
How about this?

339
00:12:37,400 --> 00:12:38,400
Next week,

340
00:12:38,400 --> 00:12:39,400
come to my house and cook.

341
00:12:39,400 --> 00:12:40,400
Rong, come with me.

342
00:12:41,400 --> 00:12:42,400
Okay.

343
00:12:42,400 --> 00:12:43,400
Come with me.

344
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:46,400
Cheers.

345
00:12:46,400 --> 00:12:47,400
Okay.

346
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,400
Thank you.

347
00:13:02,400 --> 00:13:03,400
Chairman.

348
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:04,400
Director Hong.

349
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:05,400
Here is hot tea.

350
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,400
Please enjoy.

351
00:13:06,400 --> 00:13:07,400
Can I have a cup of Pu'er tea?

352
00:13:07,400 --> 00:13:08,400
My friend sent it.

353
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:09,400
It's good.

354
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:10,400
Here is latte. Thank you.

355
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:11,400
No problem.

356
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
Please wait.

357
00:13:16,400 --> 00:13:17,400
You don't drink coffee, do you?

358
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:20,400
Sorry.

359
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:21,400
I'll go back to the room.

360
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,400
It's okay.

361
00:13:22,400 --> 00:13:23,400
Sit down.

362
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,400
Hello.

363
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:28,400
I'm in a meeting.

364
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:30,400
What about my mom?

365
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,400
I know.

366
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:36,400
I'll go back tonight.

367
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
That's it.

368
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,400
Is your aunt okay?

369
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:45,400
She's fine.

370
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:47,400
She's just a little older.

371
00:13:47,400 --> 00:13:48,400
She's older.

372
00:13:50,400 --> 00:13:51,400
So

373
00:13:52,400 --> 00:13:54,400
your wife is taking care of your aunt?

374
00:14:00,400 --> 00:14:02,400
I remember how good she is to you.

375
00:14:02,400 --> 00:14:04,400
You know what you mean.

376
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:06,400
I can't tell.

377
00:14:08,400 --> 00:14:09,400
Here is your latte.

378
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:10,400
Thank you.

379
00:14:11,400 --> 00:14:12,400
Please enjoy.

380
00:14:15,400 --> 00:14:16,400
I've never asked you

381
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:17,400
if you like Bach.

382
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't know.

383
00:14:25,400 --> 00:14:27,400
When I listen to Bach,

384
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:30,400
I feel that his thoughts are clearer.

385
00:14:31,400 --> 00:14:34,400
His music is very rational

386
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:36,400
and logical.

387
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:37,400
But

388
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:39,400
it's also very emotional.

389
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:41,400
I feel

390
00:14:43,400 --> 00:14:45,400
it's very close to God.

391
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:47,400
I know your surname is Jiao.

392
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:48,400
I don't believe it.

393
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:49,400
But my mom is very modest.

394
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:51,400
When I was a kid,

395
00:14:51,400 --> 00:14:52,400
I often went to church with her.

396
00:14:56,400 --> 00:14:58,400
Sorry to bother you.

397
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,400
It's okay.

398
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,400
What's wrong?

399
00:15:02,400 --> 00:15:03,400
I was thinking that it's time to eat.

400
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,400
Let's have lunch together.

401
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,400
Let's eat together.

402
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:09,400
No need.

403
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:10,400
I have something to do later.

404
00:15:13,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Although it's already the 21st century,

405
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,400
the illegal behavior of all countries

406
00:15:17,400 --> 00:15:20,400
in the world is very serious.

407
00:15:20,400 --> 00:15:22,400
It includes human trafficking.

408
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:24,400
Some even think that

409
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,400
the fishing industry is a wrong starting point.

410
00:15:28,400 --> 00:15:29,400
What about us?

411
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
As an island country with a maritime culture,

412
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:34,400
should we join the international law society?

413
00:15:36,400 --> 00:15:37,400
Unfortunately,

414
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:39,400
we can't participate in the discussion and development

415
00:15:39,400 --> 00:15:41,400
of the UN's maritime contract law.

416
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:43,400
Bye.

417
00:15:43,400 --> 00:15:44,400
Good luck.

418
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,400
Bye.

419
00:15:45,400 --> 00:15:46,400
Bye.

420
00:15:46,400 --> 00:15:47,400
Good luck.

421
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:49,400
Bye.

422
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:46,400
I'm sorry.

423
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:47,400
I'm sorry.

424
00:16:47,400 --> 00:16:48,400
I'm sorry.

425
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:49,400
I'm sorry.

426
00:16:49,400 --> 00:16:50,400
I'm sorry.

427
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:51,400
I'm sorry.

428
00:16:51,400 --> 00:16:52,400
I'm sorry.

429
00:16:52,400 --> 00:16:53,400
I'm sorry.

430
00:16:53,400 --> 00:16:54,400
I'm sorry.

431
00:16:54,400 --> 00:16:55,400
I'm sorry.

432
00:16:55,400 --> 00:16:56,400
I'm sorry.

433
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:57,400
I'm sorry.

434
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,400
I'm sorry.

435
00:16:58,400 --> 00:16:59,400
I'm sorry.

436
00:16:59,400 --> 00:17:00,400
I'm sorry.

437
00:17:00,400 --> 00:17:01,400
I'm sorry.

438
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:02,400
I'm sorry.

439
00:17:02,400 --> 00:17:03,400
I'm sorry.

440
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:04,400
I'm sorry.

441
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:05,400
I'm sorry.

442
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:06,400
I'm sorry.

443
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,400
I'm sorry.

444
00:17:07,400 --> 00:17:08,400
I'm sorry.

445
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm sorry.

446
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,400
I'm sorry.

447
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:11,400
I'm sorry.

448
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:12,400
I'm sorry.

449
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,400
I'm sorry.

450
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,400
I'm sorry.

451
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:15,400
I'm sorry.

452
00:17:15,400 --> 00:17:16,400
I'm sorry.

453
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:17,400
I'm sorry.

454
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:18,400
I'm sorry.

455
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:19,400
I'm sorry.

456
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:20,400
I'm sorry.

457
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:21,400
I'm sorry.

458
00:17:21,400 --> 00:17:22,400
I'm sorry.

459
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:23,400
I'm sorry.

460
00:17:23,400 --> 00:17:24,400
I'm sorry.

461
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:25,400

I'm sorry.

473
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:37,400
I'm sorry.

474
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,400

00:18:16,400 --> 00:18:17,400
I'm sorry.

512
00:18:17,400 --> 00:18:18,400
I'm sorry.

513
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:19,400
I'm sorry.

514
00:18:19,400 --> 00:18:20,400
I'm sorry.

515
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:21,400
I'm sorry.

516
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:22,400
I'm sorry.

517
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:23,400

536
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:04,400
Hello.

537
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:08,400
Why were you on your way to?

538
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:12,400
Dad, are you mad at me?

539
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:16,400
I'm just talking to your friend.

540
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
It's not a big deal.

541
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:22,400
If you hear any message, please reply to me.

542
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,400
Hello, did you receive my text message?

543
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:31,400
I just want to know if you're okay.

544
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:33,400
You didn't reply to me. I'm worried.

545
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:40,400
I'm worried about you.

546
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,400
I'm scared.

547
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,400
It hurts.

548
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:52,400
I'm so scared.

549
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,400
It hurts.

550
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:57,400
I'll call the ambulance.

551
00:19:57,400 --> 00:19:58,400
It's okay.

552
00:19:58,400 --> 00:19:59,400
I'll call the ambulance.

553
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,400
I'll call the ambulance.

554
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:03,400
I'm scared.

555
00:20:03,400 --> 00:20:05,400
I'll call the ambulance.

556
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:07,400
It hurts.

557
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,400
Hello.

558
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:10,400
Mr. Li.

559
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm sorry.

560
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:13,400
I'm late.

561
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,400
It's okay.

562
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,400
Mrs. Li is not in a good condition today.

563
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:17,400
We helped her last night.

564
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,400
We added half a sedative.

565
00:20:21,400 --> 00:20:23,400
Her condition is getting worse.

566
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:25,400
But we will continue to observe.

567
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:27,400
Don't worry.

568
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,400
I said no.

569
00:20:39,400 --> 00:20:40,400
It hurts.

570
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:41,400
It's okay.

571
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:43,400
How can you torture me?

572
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:44,400
No, no.

573
00:20:44,400 --> 00:20:45,400
Why torture me?

574
00:20:45,400 --> 00:20:46,400
The nurse is gone.

575
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,400
It's okay.

576
00:20:47,400 --> 00:20:48,400
Mom, don't worry.

577
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:50,400
The doctor said no.

578
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:53,400
It's okay, mom.

579
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,400
Do you smell it?

580
00:20:57,400 --> 00:20:59,400
Mom, I'm a fireman.

581
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:00,400
Look.

582
00:21:00,400 --> 00:21:02,400
I'm wearing a mask.

583
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,400
I'm wearing a mask.

584
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,400
I'm wearing a mask.

585
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,400
Look.

586
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:33,960
I'm wearing a pair of

587
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,400
If you're tired,

588
00:21:39,400 --> 00:21:40,400
take a good rest.

589
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:41,400
Sleep.

590
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,400
Don't think about it.

591
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:44,400
Let me go.

592
00:21:44,400 --> 00:21:46,400
Let me go.

593
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,400
Let me go.

594
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:48,400
Don't think about it.

595
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:49,400
I'm in pain.

596
00:21:49,400 --> 00:21:51,400
Don't you know?

597
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,400
Don't say that.

598
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:53,400
I know.

599
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,400
I know.

600
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:55,400
Mom.

601
00:21:55,400 --> 00:21:56,400
Mom.

602
00:21:56,400 --> 00:21:57,400
Mom, listen to me.

603
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:58,400
Mom.

604
00:21:58,400 --> 00:21:59,400
Mom.

605
00:21:59,400 --> 00:22:00,400
Mom.

606
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:01,400
Listen to me.

607
00:22:01,400 --> 00:22:02,400
Listen to me.

608
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:03,400
Listen to me.

609
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:04,400
Listen to me.

610
00:22:04,400 --> 00:22:05,400
I'm torturing you.

611
00:22:05,400 --> 00:22:06,400
I'm torturing you.

612
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,400
I'm really torturing you.

613
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,400
Relax.

614
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:11,400
I'm fine.

615
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:13,400
I'm fine.

616
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,400
I'm back.

617
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:38,400
I'm back.

618
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:39,400
You're back so quickly.

619
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,400
Aren't you stuck in traffic?

620
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:41,400
I'm back.

621
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:42,400
What happened?

622
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:43,400
It hasn't gotten better.

623
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:44,400
It hasn't gotten better.

624
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:45,400
What hasn't gotten better?

625
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:46,400
What are you doing?

626
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:47,400
I'm making rice for you.

627
00:22:47,400 --> 00:22:48,400
What is it for?

628
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:49,400
It's very hot.

629
00:22:49,400 --> 00:22:50,400
And it's so looks like it's not hot.

630
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:51,400
What?

631
00:22:51,400 --> 00:22:52,400
You were just staying at home.

632
00:22:52,400 --> 00:22:53,400
What is going on?

633
00:22:53,400 --> 00:22:54,400
Come on.

634
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:55,400
Come on.

635
00:22:55,400 --> 00:22:56,400
You're not staying.

636
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:57,400
No.

637
00:22:57,400 --> 00:22:58,400
I'm so scared.

638
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,400
Let me.

639
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:00,400
I'm really scared.

640
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,400
Let me go.

641
00:23:02,400 --> 00:23:03,400
I'm sorry.

642
00:23:03,400 --> 00:23:04,400
Come on.

643
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:07,400
Chen Han Rong can cook.

644
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:08,400
You're so annoying.

645
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:10,400
What are you cooking?

646
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:12,400
Fried rice with egg.

647
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:13,400
Go away.

648
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:14,400
I don't need your help.

649
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:15,400
I can do it.

650
00:23:18,400 --> 00:23:19,400
Come on.

651
00:23:19,400 --> 00:23:20,400
Tell me.

652
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:22,400
What happened?

653
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:23,400
You know it.

654
00:23:32,400 --> 00:23:33,400
Let me ask you.

655
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:34,400
Yes.

656
00:23:34,400 --> 00:23:37,400
I don't know who he knows recently.

657
00:23:37,400 --> 00:23:39,400
I was thinking when you would ask me.

658
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:40,400
What did you find?

659
00:23:41,400 --> 00:23:43,400
Yesterday.

660
00:23:43,400 --> 00:23:44,400
After playing with a client,

661
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:46,400
he got a call.

662
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,400
He threw me directly at the end of the line and left.

663
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,400
Isn't that too much?

664
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:00,400
Li Xian Hong from Zhe Ren Group.

665
00:24:00,400 --> 00:24:02,400
It's him, right?

666
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:06,400
He's a Facebook user.

667
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:07,400
Did he have a family friend?

668
00:24:07,400 --> 00:24:08,400
You didn't tell me.

669
00:24:09,400 --> 00:24:10,400
Why do you ask so many questions?

670
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,400
He just didn't want you to know.

671
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,400
Of course I should know.

672
00:24:14,400 --> 00:24:15,400
It was like this before.

673
00:24:15,400 --> 00:24:17,400
He arranged a private trip and didn't tell me.

674
00:24:17,400 --> 00:24:18,400
Later, we had a meeting with the director of foreign affairs.

675
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,400
I couldn't find anyone.

676
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:21,400
He asked me before.

677
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:22,400
I taught a student.

678
00:24:22,400 --> 00:24:23,400
Who?

679
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:27,400
Look at his Facebook.

680
00:24:29,400 --> 00:24:31,400
He just came back from New York.

681
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:33,400
He's pretty.

682
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:34,400
He's thoughtful and good at keeping the trend.

683
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:35,400
He's been in the media.

684
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:39,400
He seems to be reading visual messages.

685
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:42,400
Experience curate.

686
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:44,400
What kind of job is this?

687
00:24:45,400 --> 00:24:48,400
It seems to be an experience editor.

688
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,400
I don't know.

689
00:24:57,400 --> 00:24:59,400
Can we order takeout?

690
00:24:59,400 --> 00:25:00,400
I'm the owner of this restaurant.

691
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,400
I'm telling you.

692
00:25:07,400 --> 00:25:08,400
But I don't dare to eat this.

693
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:15,400
You have to hold the egg when you eat a bowl of rice.

694
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:30,400
I haven't played in Taiwan for a long time.

695
00:25:31,400 --> 00:25:32,400
Our factory is still good.

696
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:34,400
Service is close.

697
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:37,400
In the end, the service is still understood by the Taiwanese.

698
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:39,400
Shen Zong.

699
00:25:40,400 --> 00:25:42,400
If you need anything, try to tell Ma Erong.

700
00:25:43,400 --> 00:25:44,400
She has been with us for many years.

701
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:45,400
She is careful and hard to do.

702
00:25:46,400 --> 00:25:49,400
She is more strict than me in handling the details of things.

703
00:25:49,400 --> 00:25:51,400
With her, I can relax completely.

704
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:53,400
I'm telling you.

705
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:54,400
I'm telling you.

706
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:55,400
I'm telling you.

707
00:25:55,400 --> 00:25:56,400
I'm telling you.

708
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:57,400
I'm telling you.

709
00:25:57,400 --> 00:25:58,400
I'm telling you.

710
00:25:58,400 --> 00:25:59,400
I'm telling you.

711
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,400
That way, I can relax completely.

712
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:02,400
Of course.

713
00:26:02,400 --> 00:26:03,400
No problem.

714
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:06,400
Mr. Shen.

715
00:26:06,400 --> 00:26:07,400
You can continue.

716
00:26:07,400 --> 00:26:08,400
I'm going up first.

717
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:09,400
OK.

718
00:26:09,400 --> 00:26:10,400
We'll go home later.

719
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:55,760
regen

720
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:00,720
Li-Fang, don't forget to wash my hands later.

721
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:01,240
All right.

722
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:04,040
Ity, I've been trying to get it.

723
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:04,800
Feng Teng,

724
00:27:04,940 --> 00:27:05,360
take it easy.

725
00:27:05,360 --> 00:27:05,960
I got it.

726
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:06,920
Take it easy?

727
00:27:13,960 --> 00:27:14,980
Do you want one more?

728
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,120
Do I mean...

729
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:16,640
Do I mean,

730
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:17,580
this ice cream?

731
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:18,140
Yes.

732
00:27:18,420 --> 00:27:19,200
Chung-Chung,

733
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:20,160
I'll make one more green tea.

734
00:27:22,260 --> 00:27:23,540
I've tried every kind of green tea.

735
00:27:23,540 --> 00:27:24,640
attempting them ourselves...

736
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:26,860
You're 그것 à mettre des que un autre.

737
00:27:26,860 --> 00:27:27,680
You should try it.

738
00:27:27,680 --> 00:27:28,680
You're here.

739
00:27:34,680 --> 00:27:36,680
Why did you come today?

740
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:39,680
I miss you.

741
00:27:43,680 --> 00:27:45,680
Are you okay?

742
00:27:47,680 --> 00:27:49,680
Did you ask me or my mom?

743
00:27:50,680 --> 00:27:52,680
I went to see mom a few days ago.

744
00:27:52,680 --> 00:27:53,680
She was fine.

745
00:27:54,680 --> 00:27:55,680
That's how old people are.

746
00:27:55,680 --> 00:27:56,680
That's how old people are.

747
00:27:56,680 --> 00:27:57,680
After a few days,

748
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,680
you may be in a better shape.

749
00:28:12,680 --> 00:28:13,680
All right.

750
00:28:13,680 --> 00:28:15,680
Don't think too much.

751
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:16,680
Take a break.

752
00:28:25,680 --> 00:28:26,680
I'm fine.

753
00:28:37,680 --> 00:28:39,680
Do you remember Mr. Shen?

754
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,680
Yes.

755
00:28:43,680 --> 00:28:46,680
He was in a deep relationship with the client.

756
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:49,680
It's good for him to maintain a good relationship.

757
00:28:49,680 --> 00:28:52,680
But now the situation in both cases is getting worse.

758
00:28:52,680 --> 00:28:54,680
The media is changing so fast.

759
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:59,680
I think it's my best to get this thing done.

760
00:29:00,680 --> 00:29:03,680
After the relationship in Taiwan is established,

761
00:29:03,680 --> 00:29:07,680
everyone who is interested in culture will go to the island.

762
00:29:13,680 --> 00:29:15,680
Now in Taiwan,

763
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,680
you're the old man who's helping you.

764
00:29:18,680 --> 00:29:21,680
But I think the way in Taiwan is different.

765
00:29:21,680 --> 00:29:23,680
You have to be more careful.

766
00:29:25,680 --> 00:29:28,680
I have nothing to fear with you by my side.

767
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,680
When we get there,

768
00:29:34,680 --> 00:29:36,680
I'll take you there.

769
00:29:51,680 --> 00:29:52,680
Here.

770
00:29:55,680 --> 00:29:56,680
Here.

771
00:30:26,680 --> 00:30:27,680
JJ.

772
00:30:28,680 --> 00:30:30,680
Happy birthday.

773
00:30:33,680 --> 00:30:36,680
You forgot it when you came in.

774
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:38,680
I remember it every year.

775
00:30:38,680 --> 00:30:40,680
It's obvious when you cook.

776
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,680
But there's no cake.

777
00:30:43,680 --> 00:30:45,680
It's cake when you cook.

778
00:30:45,680 --> 00:30:46,680
I cooked it myself.

779
00:30:46,680 --> 00:30:49,680
It's more sincere than buying cake from outside.

780
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,680
I'll go to the hospital.

781
00:30:53,680 --> 00:30:55,680
I'll go to the hospital.

782
00:30:57,680 --> 00:30:59,680
I'll go to the hospital.

783
00:31:03,680 --> 00:31:05,680
Can I make a wish now?

784
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,680
Why did you lose so much hair?

785
00:31:22,680 --> 00:31:23,680
Second,

786
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:26,680
God, I hope my students can be smarter.

787
00:31:26,680 --> 00:31:29,680
Otherwise, my brain cells will die too fast.

788
00:31:29,680 --> 00:31:30,680
Third,

789
00:31:49,680 --> 00:31:51,680
it's time to go to the hospital.

790
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
See you later.

791
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:53,680
Bye.

792
00:31:58,680 --> 00:32:00,680
I'll go to the hospital.

793
00:32:06,680 --> 00:32:09,680
Do you feel tired from making the same wish every year?

794
00:32:13,680 --> 00:32:15,680
It's special today.

795
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:18,680
You are the only one in the world

796
00:32:18,680 --> 00:32:20,680
Although this fried rice is not very delicious,

797
00:32:20,680 --> 00:32:22,680
but it's really delicious.

798
00:32:48,680 --> 00:32:50,680
I'm sorry.

799
00:33:13,680 --> 00:33:15,680
When we love someone,

800
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:17,680
it's because we like him.

801
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,680
The person who is with that person.

802
00:33:30,680 --> 00:33:33,680
Love is a pure physical need.

803
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,680
Love is a pure physical need.

804
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:21,680
Love is a pure physical need.

805
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,680
Love is a pure physical need.

806
00:35:18,680 --> 00:35:21,680
Brother.

807
00:35:49,680 --> 00:35:51,680
After the rain,

808
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:53,680
the feeling of being honest

809
00:35:53,680 --> 00:35:55,680
and honest with each other

810
00:35:55,680 --> 00:35:57,680
is like a real couple.

811
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,680
It makes happiness and desire

812
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:01,680
indistinguishable.

813
00:36:03,680 --> 00:36:05,680
The essence of desire is not to own,

814
00:36:05,680 --> 00:36:07,680
but the moment that you can't own.

815
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:11,680
It makes people want more and more.

816
00:36:18,680 --> 00:36:20,680
Love is a pure physical need.

817
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:22,680
Love is a pure physical need.

818
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,680
Love is a pure physical need.

819
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,680
Love is a pure physical need.

820
00:36:26,680 --> 00:36:28,680
Love is a pure physical need.

821
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:30,680
Love is a pure physical need.

822
00:36:30,680 --> 00:36:32,680
Love is a pure physical need.

823
00:36:32,680 --> 00:36:34,680
Love is a pure physical need.

824
00:36:34,680 --> 00:36:36,680
Love is a pure physical need.

825
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,680
Love is a pure physical need.

826
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
Love is a pure physical need.

827
00:36:40,680 --> 00:36:42,680
Love is a pure physical need.

828
00:36:42,680 --> 00:36:44,680
Love is a pure physical need.

829
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,680
Love is a pure physical need.

830
00:36:46,680 --> 00:36:48,680
Love is a pure physical need.

831
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:50,680
Love is a pure physical need.

832
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:52,680
Love is a pure physical need.

833
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:54,680
Love is a pure physical need.

834
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:56,680
Love is a pure physical need.

835
00:36:56,680 --> 00:36:58,680
Love is a pure physical need.

836
00:36:58,680 --> 00:37:00,680
Love is a pure physical need.

837
00:37:00,680 --> 00:37:02,680
Love is a pure physical need.

838
00:37:02,680 --> 00:37:04,680
Love is a pure physical need.

839
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:06,680
Love is a pure physical need.

840
00:37:06,680 --> 00:37:08,680
Love is a pure physical need.

841
00:37:08,680 --> 00:37:10,680
Love is a pure physical need.

842
00:37:10,680 --> 00:37:12,680
Love is a pure physical need.

843
00:37:12,680 --> 00:37:14,680
Love is a pure physical need.

844
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:16,680
Love is a pure physical need.

845
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:18,680
Love is a pure physical need.

846
00:37:18,680 --> 00:37:20,680
Love is a pure physical need.

847
00:37:20,680 --> 00:37:22,680
Love is a pure physical need.

848
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:24,680
Love is a pure physical need.

849
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:26,680
Love is a pure physical need.

850
00:37:26,680 --> 00:37:28,680
Love is a pure physical need.

851
00:37:28,680 --> 00:37:30,680
Love is a pure physical need.

852
00:37:30,680 --> 00:37:32,680
Love is a pure physical need.

853
00:37:32,680 --> 00:37:34,680
Love is a pure physical need.

854
00:37:34,680 --> 00:37:36,680
Love is a pure physical need.

855
00:37:36,680 --> 00:37:38,680
Love is a pure physical need.

856
00:37:38,680 --> 00:37:40,680
Love is a pure physical need.

857
00:37:40,680 --> 00:37:42,680
Love is a pure physical need.

858
00:37:43,180 --> 00:37:45,180
I love you.

859
00:37:46,380 --> 00:37:47,780
Could you say that again?

860
00:37:47,980 --> 00:37:49,180
Gosh, there couldn't be anymore.

861
00:37:49,180 --> 00:37:50,680
There couldn't be anymore.

862
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:53,180
Hello.

863
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,180
Boss.

864
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:02,380
I called the restaurant you ordered.

865
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:04,380
But they burned their restaurant down.

866
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:05,680
Did you tell them about the business?

867
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:06,480
I did.

868
00:38:06,480 --> 00:38:08,280
They apologized.

869
00:38:12,680 --> 00:38:14,120
Thank you.

870
00:38:14,120 --> 00:38:15,360
What kind of restaurant is that?

871
00:38:15,360 --> 00:38:17,960
It's the American restaurant I helped my college classmate get a job.

872
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:19,080
Because he came back from the US.

873
00:38:19,080 --> 00:38:21,400
I thought it would be better to ask him to go to American restaurant.

874
00:38:21,400 --> 00:38:22,600
But then I just...

875
00:38:22,600 --> 00:38:25,120
You and your classmate have a restaurant together.

876
00:38:25,120 --> 00:38:27,320
Do you think it's like that?

877
00:38:38,800 --> 00:38:40,600
The boss is here.

878
00:38:42,680 --> 00:38:44,880
The best Counterstrike COMPANY

879
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:48,360
Since Wassamisu always takes you to the tailg vs.

880
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,160
Let's have sex together.

881
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,160
I'm sorry.

882
00:38:55,160 --> 00:38:58,160
Do you think I can talk about business in this kind of environment?

883
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:02,160
I'll look for it right now.

884
00:39:03,160 --> 00:39:05,160
There should be a restaurant nearby.

885
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,160
It's 3.2...

886
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:09,160
Shit.

887
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:13,160
My classmate is here.

888
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,160
Boss, I'm going to the meeting right now.

889
00:39:25,160 --> 00:39:26,160
It should be easy to get in.

890
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:28,160
I'm very familiar with the store.

891
00:39:28,160 --> 00:39:29,160
It's okay. I'll talk to my friend.

892
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:30,160
No need.

893
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:31,160
Just like this.

894
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:53,160
I heard from Qiong that you just came back from New York.

895
00:39:53,160 --> 00:39:54,160
Yes.

896
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,160
Did Mr. Li say you were in New York?

897
00:39:56,160 --> 00:39:57,160
Yes.

898
00:39:57,160 --> 00:39:59,160
I graduated from NYU.

899
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,160
Really?

900
00:40:00,160 --> 00:40:02,160
Which year?

901
00:40:02,160 --> 00:40:04,160
Many years ago.

902
00:40:04,160 --> 00:40:05,160
New York has changed a lot.

903
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:06,160
I believe so.

904
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,160
I haven't been back for a long time.

905
00:40:08,160 --> 00:40:10,160
To be honest, Mr. Li, I admire you.

906
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,160
You're a very good student.

907
00:40:12,160 --> 00:40:14,160
You're very good at studying.

908
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:16,160
I'm very happy to see you.

909
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:18,160
I'm very happy to see you.

910
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:20,160
I really admire you.

911
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:25,160
You dare to use Qiong to be your secretary.

912
00:40:25,160 --> 00:40:26,160
Yes.

913
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:28,160
He's the one who needs the most secretary in the world.

914
00:40:28,160 --> 00:40:29,160
It's okay.

915
00:40:29,160 --> 00:40:31,160
And he will arrange for me to pick you up.

916
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:33,160
It should be only Qiong.

917
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:34,160
Yes.

918
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,160
Qiong, have you seen Aaron?

919
00:40:43,160 --> 00:40:44,160
Yes.

920
00:40:49,160 --> 00:40:51,160
I'm sorry to bother you.

921
00:40:51,160 --> 00:40:52,160
It's okay.

922
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:55,160
We'll have a chat later.

923
00:40:57,160 --> 00:40:58,160
Thank you.

924
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,160
What would you like to eat?

925
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:02,160
I'm going to go to the Dutch today.

926
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,160
I'm here to pay the bill.

927
00:41:05,160 --> 00:41:06,160
Why?

928
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:08,160
It's for boys.

929
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:10,160
Why do boys have to pay for girls?

930
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:14,160
Unless it's a boyfriend or girlfriend.

931
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:16,160
Okay.

932
00:41:17,160 --> 00:41:19,160
We can talk about our feelings.

933
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,160
Aaron is here.

934
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:23,160
Long time no see.

935
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:24,160
Please have a seat.

936
00:41:24,160 --> 00:41:25,160
Okay.

937
00:41:25,160 --> 00:41:27,160
This is my friend, Lee.

938
00:41:27,160 --> 00:41:29,160
Nice to meet you.

939
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:31,160
Is your dad okay?

940
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,160
He's fine.

941
00:41:32,160 --> 00:41:33,160
He plays three times a week.

942
00:41:33,160 --> 00:41:34,160
Really?

943
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:35,160
He said that

944
00:41:35,160 --> 00:41:37,160
we're all good at playing like uncle.

945
00:41:37,160 --> 00:41:39,160
He'll play in Taiwan in October.

946
00:41:39,160 --> 00:41:40,160
Okay.

947
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,160
No problem.

948
00:41:41,160 --> 00:41:44,160
Why do you want to meet here today?

949
00:41:47,160 --> 00:41:48,160
Hi.

950
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:49,160
Hi.

951
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:51,160
I called you

952
00:41:51,160 --> 00:41:53,160
to ask about the big players.

953
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:55,160
Are there any new players

954
00:41:55,160 --> 00:41:57,160
that are going to be in the game?

955
00:41:57,160 --> 00:41:59,160
It's harder than I thought.

956
00:41:59,160 --> 00:42:00,160
But I know the guys.

957
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:01,160
He's my bro.

958
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,160
So I think

959
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:04,160
I can push uncle a little bit.

960
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:05,160
It should be fine.

961
00:42:05,160 --> 00:42:06,160
Thank you.

962
00:42:06,160 --> 00:42:08,160
Aaron sounds like a good guy.

963
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:10,160
No.

964
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:11,160
We're just good friends.

965
00:42:11,160 --> 00:42:13,160
And I'm thinking if it goes well,

966
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:15,160
we can go in the next year.

967
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,160
Great.

968
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,160
Thank you.

969
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Wait.

970
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:22,160
Let's take a picture.

971
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:30,160
Double date it is.

972
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:31,160
This is good.

973
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:33,160
What's your Facebook account?

974
00:42:33,160 --> 00:42:34,160
I'll tag you.

975
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,160
I don't have it.

976
00:42:37,160 --> 00:42:38,160
You don't?

977
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:39,160
Yes.

978
00:42:39,160 --> 00:42:40,160
He doesn't?

979
00:42:40,160 --> 00:42:41,160
Do you have it?

980
00:42:41,160 --> 00:42:42,160
I'll add you as my friend.

981
00:42:42,160 --> 00:42:43,160
Okay.

982
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:44,160
Then you can add me.

983
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:45,160
Okay.

984
00:42:45,160 --> 00:42:46,160
Everyone, add me.

985
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:48,160
I don't have a Facebook account.

986
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,160
I used to have one.

987
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:51,160
But I lost it after I came back from New York.

988
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:52,160
You can add me.

989
00:42:52,160 --> 00:42:54,160
It's convenient for you to contact me

990
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:55,160
when you come to Shanghai.

991
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,160
Okay.

992
00:42:56,160 --> 00:42:57,160
Then you can add me on WeChat.

993
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,160
Sure.

994
00:42:58,160 --> 00:42:59,160
Uncle's friend is my friend.

995
00:42:59,160 --> 00:43:00,160
Then we'll have to ask for help.

996
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:01,160
Here you go.

997
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,160
The guy in love is Ai Qing.

998
00:43:06,160 --> 00:43:07,160
So cute.

999
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:11,160
But he doesn't love her.

1000
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,160
Hi.

1001
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:17,160
Do you have it?

1002
00:43:17,160 --> 00:43:18,160
Yes.

1003
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,160
Did you see it?

1004
00:43:19,160 --> 00:43:20,160
Yes.

1005
00:43:29,160 --> 00:43:31,160
We're waiting for someone to come.

1006
00:43:32,160 --> 00:43:34,160
A signal that once promised.

1007
00:43:43,160 --> 00:43:45,160
The secret is a closed circle.

1008
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:47,160
There is no mushroom.

1009
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:44,160
We

1010
00:44:45,160 --> 00:44:46,160
really love each other.

1011
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:15,160
Yes.

1012
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,160
Because we

1013
00:45:18,160 --> 00:45:19,160
are waiting.

1014
00:45:44,160 --> 00:45:45,160
I'm sorry.

1015
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,160
I'm sorry.

1016
00:45:48,160 --> 00:45:49,160
I'm sorry.

1017
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:51,160
I'm sorry.

1018
00:46:13,160 --> 00:46:14,160
I'm sorry.

1019
00:46:43,160 --> 00:46:45,160
I'm sorry.

1020
00:47:14,160 --> 00:47:17,160
Longer than most

1021
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:22,160
My day is short

1022
00:47:24,160 --> 00:47:27,160
Shorter than ice melt

1023
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:35,160
My heart is slow

1024
00:47:37,160 --> 00:47:40,160
Lower than shadows

1025
00:47:41,160 --> 00:47:45,160
My ground is frail

1026
00:47:47,160 --> 00:47:51,160
You can't stand but be very still

1027
00:47:57,160 --> 00:48:00,160
All of this

1028
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,160
All of this

1029
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:06,160
Can be yours

1030
00:48:10,160 --> 00:48:13,160
If it's worth a thing

1031
00:48:14,160 --> 00:48:16,160
All of this

1032
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,160
Can be yours

1033
00:48:24,160 --> 00:48:27,160
I don't have a plan

1034
00:48:27,160 --> 00:48:30,160
But all I am

1035
00:48:30,160 --> 00:48:35,160
Is true to my way

1036
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:40,160
My eyes are crystal

1037
00:48:41,160 --> 00:48:45,160
The rest is just pale

1038
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:50,160
My songs are riddled

1039
00:48:51,160 --> 00:48:55,160
It's all my own thought

1040
00:48:59,160 --> 00:49:04,160
My chest is full

1041
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:08,160
My chest built thick walls

1042
00:49:09,160 --> 00:49:12,160
To ignore that it's hollow

1043
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:18,160
My time is my own

1044
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:23,160
And it's yours as well

1045
00:49:29,160 --> 00:49:32,160
All of this

1046
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,160
All of this

1047
00:49:35,160 --> 00:49:38,160
Can be yours

1048
00:49:42,160 --> 00:49:45,160
If it's worth a thing

1049
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:48,160
All of this

1050
00:49:48,160 --> 00:49:50,160
Can be yours

1051
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:58,160
I don't have a plan

1052
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,160
But all I am

1053
00:50:01,160 --> 00:50:07,160
Is true to my way

1054
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:14,160
This is my world

1055
00:50:17,160 --> 00:50:21,160
You are my world
