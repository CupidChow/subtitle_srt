No, no, no. Please tell the hospital that I want to stay for a few more days.

Jiaxin has been quite focused with the company lately.

I want to train him longer.

Okay.

30
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,960
I will handle it.

Wait! You look so well that you don't look like a patient at all.

00:02:40,570 --> 00:02:42,399
It's just the same. Still not quite well.

00:02:42,399 --> 00:02:45,539
Just rest well. Don't worry about anything else.

By the way, Mom,

47
00:02:50,060 --> 00:02:53,910
we are working on the revision of Love Note.

00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:55,980

52

Jiangyue and I.

53
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:16,129
Ever since we started dating, we have developed a new understanding of love

54
00:03:16,129 --> 00:03:18,529
and combined it into this revision.

55
00:03:18,529 --> 00:03:20,730
Let me explain it to you, Mom.

56
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:23,759
This time, we divided it into three different sections.

57
00:03:23,759 --> 00:03:26,499
In the first section, we fixed some existing bugs.

58
00:03:26,499 --> 00:03:28,520
In the second, we updated...

59
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:43,700
<i>We want to jointly develop a great platform,</i>

60
00:03:43,700 --> 00:03:46,980
<i>where every single young person can find their true love.</i>

61
00:03:46,980 --> 00:03:48,300
<i>Yes.</i>

62
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:50,289
<i>Love is our weapon against the world,</i>

63
00:03:50,289 --> 00:03:53,630
<i>and the only thing that can make us better.</i>

64
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:03,060
It suits our existing users better.

65
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:06,219
So, Mom, what you need to do now is rest.

66
00:04:06,219 --> 00:04:07,809
When you return to the company,

67
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:10,089
I promise everything will get back on track.

68
00:04:10,089 --> 00:04:12,109
It's only been two months since I left,

69
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,900
yet so many things have happened.

70
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:17,099
It really is the world of young people now.

71
00:04:17,099 --> 00:04:20,310
I should consider retirement maybe.

72
00:04:20,310 --> 00:04:23,740
Don't be ridiculous. You are bound to work until 80 given your personality.

73
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,169
You promised you'd return.

74
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:27,979
Get well soon. Don't think about retirement.

75
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:30,130
That's sweet.

76
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:35,379
I want to speak to Jiangyue for a while.

77
00:04:35,379 --> 00:04:38,290
Can you buy some drinks for us?

78
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,539
What are you going to say, Mom?

79
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:44,409
It's not like I will eat her alive. Come on.

80
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:46,290
Jiaxin, come on.

81
00:04:58,820 --> 00:05:01,150
Jiangyue, you and Jiaxin...

82
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:03,310
We are quite well.

83
00:05:03,310 --> 00:05:07,160
If... you want me to break up with him,

84
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,900
before, I might have considered it,

85
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:13,100
but today, I just want to tell you

86
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:17,000
that Jiaxin let me know what true love is...

87
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:20,460
and gave me the courage to face it.

88
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,800
So, I won't break up with him that easily,

89
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:26,370
whether you like it or not.

90
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:29,860
You are really like me when I was young.

91
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:33,170
People like us never give up

92
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,779
on things that we really want,

93
00:05:34,779 --> 00:05:36,729
both in work or relationships.

94
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:39,120
This can be both a strength and a weakness,

95
00:05:39,940 --> 00:05:42,569
unless you've found the one that is worth it.

96
00:05:42,569 --> 00:05:46,780
To me, Jiaxin is worth it.

97
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:50,489
I am not going to put my hands on your relationship anymore.

98
00:05:50,489 --> 00:05:54,139
Since I already let you and Jiaxin manage the company, just go for it.

99
00:05:54,139 --> 00:05:57,090
The company needs some fresh blood in the management anyway.

100
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:58,590
Thank you.

101
00:05:59,380 --> 00:06:03,280
Actually, I also have something to tell you today.

102
00:06:03,850 --> 00:06:05,910
It's about Jiaxin's dreams.

103
00:06:11,820 --> 00:06:13,820
- Jiaxin.
- Mr. Xu.

104
00:06:18,480 --> 00:06:22,570
Ms. Jin, the hospital required your signature.

105
00:06:22,570 --> 00:06:25,389
How about having dinner with us tonight?

106
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:27,960
You guys have been working hard for the company.

107
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,269
Okay, thanks, Mom.

108
00:06:29,270 --> 00:06:30,660
It's Ms. Jin.

109
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,290
Ms. Jin.

110
00:06:32,290 --> 00:06:34,899
- I am going to sign now.
- Okay, come on.

111
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,369
- What?
- What did my mom say to you?

112
00:06:45,369 --> 00:06:49,210
Nothing, just work.

113
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:58,070
Impossible. It can't be just that.

114
00:06:58,070 --> 00:07:00,599
I think if your mom knew that you didn't trust her,

115
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:02,870
she would be sad.

116
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:08,970
Actually,

117
00:07:09,640 --> 00:07:12,020
I didn't understand her before.

118
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:14,900
Especially after my dad's passing away.

119
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,900
She became increasingly busier and spent much less time with me.

120
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:20,760
I just didn't understand.

121
00:07:20,760 --> 00:07:22,760
What did she work that hard for?

122
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:25,740
How can she abandon me

123
00:07:25,740 --> 00:07:28,520
just for money and fame?

124
00:07:29,110 --> 00:07:32,960
You can try thinking from her perspective.

125
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,050
Yes.

126
00:07:39,070 --> 00:07:43,420
When I was sitting in her seat in the company,

127
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:48,929
I finally understood the effort and time that it took

128
00:07:48,929 --> 00:07:50,950
to be a good leader.

129
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,819
Without those, success is simply a mirage.

130
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:56,430
I am glad that you can feel this.

131
00:07:56,430 --> 00:07:58,680
It's a sign of your maturity.

132
00:07:59,790 --> 00:08:03,500
You should tell your mom about all these things.

133
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:06,670
I know I am still not mature enough.

134
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:11,120
I keep upsetting her at this age.

135
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,819
You should have a conversation to solve your misunderstanding.

136
00:08:16,110 --> 00:08:17,800
We'll see.

137
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:23,509
<i>How about our cooperation?</i>

138
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,619
<i>Before I came here, I had visited Ms. Jin at the hospital.</i>

139
00:08:26,619 --> 00:08:29,970
<i>I wanted to talk to her directly without consulting you.</i>

140
00:08:29,970 --> 00:08:31,420
<i>What did she say?</i>

141
00:08:31,420 --> 00:08:34,520
<i>She said she had changed her mind.</i>

142
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:37,319
<i>She wanted to take a bet on you,</i>

143
00:08:37,320 --> 00:08:41,319
end the buyout, and recruit collaborators to continue the project.

144
00:08:41,319 --> 00:08:44,800
<i>But your plans did surprise me.</i>

145
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:46,810
<i>My mom really said that?</i>

146
00:08:46,810 --> 00:08:50,579
<i>As someone with no kids, you won't understand how parents care about their children.</i>

147
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:06,080
In today's meeting,

148
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,200
two announcements will be made.

149
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,960
First, rumor says our company will be bought out.

150
00:09:14,960 --> 00:09:19,659
And today I am clarifying this, that won't happen.

151
00:09:19,659 --> 00:09:23,119
We have gone through the crisis and received new funds.

152
00:09:23,119 --> 00:09:25,249
Love Note will be remade soon.

153
00:09:25,249 --> 00:09:27,430
I need your full attention right now.

154
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,119
Second, an unusual situation occurred inside our company.

155
00:09:31,119 --> 00:09:33,730
Someone chose to betray our company

156
00:09:33,730 --> 00:09:36,880
for their own profits during our hard times

157
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:41,050
and that one is our general manager, Song Xue.

158
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,470
<i>- No way. That's not possible.
- How could she?</i>
- Mr. Gu...

159
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:48,699
I hope you can think twice before saying things like this.

160
00:09:48,699 --> 00:09:53,649
Everyone here knows I have been working hard for this company for many years.

161
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:57,860
I don't think it's fair for you to say that.

162
00:09:57,860 --> 00:10:01,300
Yes. Ms. Song has been working for our company for many years.

163
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,659
How can she do that?

164
00:10:03,659 --> 00:10:07,009
Do you have any proof for that, young man?

165
00:10:07,009 --> 00:10:09,000
Right here.

166
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:13,959
These are the emails and phone call records of Song Xue contacting

167
00:10:13,959 --> 00:10:19,090
privately with that company in order to push the buyout.

168
00:10:20,280 --> 00:10:21,700
<i>How could this be?</i>

169
00:10:21,700 --> 00:10:23,540
<i>That's the proof?</i>

170
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:26,609
<i>How can this be? That's unbelievable.</i>

171
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:32,890
Zhao Jiangyue, you did this, didn't you?

172
00:10:32,890 --> 00:10:35,450
I always knew you disliked me.

173
00:10:35,450 --> 00:10:37,669
No wonder you spent a long time bearing me.

174
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:39,480
This is your move against me.

175
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:42,780
As a woman, I understand how you feel.

176
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:46,240
But it's unacceptable and immoral

177
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,079
to betray the company just for your own good.

178
00:10:49,080 --> 00:10:53,010
Ms. Zhao asked me to forgive you.

179
00:10:53,910 --> 00:10:55,809
But you don't show any shame and guilt today,

180
00:10:55,809 --> 00:10:57,759
still trying to defend your faults.

181
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,300
So now, you are fired.

182
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:02,199
Is this your decision or Ms. Jin's?

183
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,179
Even if Ms. Song did betray the company,

184
00:11:05,179 --> 00:11:08,909
you can't just fire her like this.

185
00:11:08,910 --> 00:11:11,079
Right, Ms. Jin hasn't said anything yet.

186
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:13,319
Have you investigated fully?

187
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:14,279
- Right.
- Right.

188
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:16,350
I don't think firing is necessary.

189
00:11:17,150 --> 00:11:19,029
<i>How did things go with Mr. Gu?</i>

190
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:20,929
<i>He said he needed to consider a while longer.</i>

191
00:11:20,929 --> 00:11:22,339
<i>Then let's keep in touch.</i>

192
00:11:22,339 --> 00:11:26,389
<i>Don't worry, I will help you with the buyout of Love Note.</i>

193
00:11:28,370 --> 00:11:30,139
Firing is not something that should be decided that easily.

194
00:11:30,139 --> 00:11:32,220
I agree with Jiaxin's decision.

195
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,540
Ms. Jin.

196
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:39,519
I have verified the proof Jiaxin presented to me.

197
00:11:39,520 --> 00:11:41,900
Lisheng, show them.

198
00:11:44,050 --> 00:11:45,930
<i>Let me see.</i>

199
00:11:52,250 --> 00:11:56,420
- Ms. Jin...
- You have already been fired so you're not allowed to attend any meeting of Link's.

200
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,320
You are dismissed.

201
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:13,610
I am going to fire one more person today.

202
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,100
<i>Who?</i>

203
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:18,670
Our acting president, Gu Jiaxin.

204
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:22,570
- You are firing me?
- Any questions?

205
00:12:22,570 --> 00:12:25,390
No. I agree.

206
00:12:25,390 --> 00:12:29,269
Good. The meeting is over. Get back to work.

207
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:33,940
Let's talk later.

208
00:12:39,590 --> 00:12:44,600
Mom, am I actually free to go now?

209
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,280
Yes. Well, if that's not what you want, I can...

210
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,960
No, no, no.

211
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:51,810
What are your plans now?

212
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:55,300
Right now, I'm going to focus on training.

213
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:57,420
Racing then.

214
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:03,010
I know you might not understand,

215
00:13:03,010 --> 00:13:06,340
but it is really important to me.

216
00:13:06,340 --> 00:13:09,660
I won't interfere with your things anymore.

217
00:13:09,660 --> 00:13:13,080
- What?
- Jiangyue already told me.

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,290
<i>[2018 Sujiang Motorcycle Racing Championship Award Ceremony]</i>

219
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:25,860
<i>This is the recording of Jiaxin's first time winning a race.</i>

220
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,930
<i>At first, just like you, I believed that racing was</i>

221
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:34,080
<i>something neither serious nor safe.</i>

222
00:13:34,080 --> 00:13:38,130
<i>But later on, I realized it is his most valuable memory.</i>

223
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:42,670
<i>He feels the most freedom and happiness only when he is racing.</i>

224
00:13:42,670 --> 00:13:47,150
<i>As his mother, you are the one that wants him to be happy the most.</i>

225
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:53,250
<i>Therefore... I hope you can carefully think about his dreams.</i>

226
00:13:53,250 --> 00:13:55,610
<i>He needs some space.</i>

227
00:13:55,610 --> 00:13:59,840
<i>What we think is good might not be what he wants.</i>

228
00:14:05,640 --> 00:14:08,440
So this is what you two were talking about in the hospital.

229
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:19,129
Although I am your mother that gave you life,

230
00:14:19,129 --> 00:14:22,870
I can't decide what your life should be like.

231
00:14:22,870 --> 00:14:25,740
If racing is where your passion lies in, then just go for it.

232
00:14:25,740 --> 00:14:28,930
It's hard to find what you truly love.

233
00:14:28,930 --> 00:14:31,010
I will support you.

234
00:14:31,010 --> 00:14:34,270
Actually, I am quite sorry about Kang Zhe.

235
00:14:34,270 --> 00:14:38,810
I owe you an apology and owe him a thank you.

236
00:14:38,810 --> 00:14:41,470
I should compensate for this

237
00:14:42,030 --> 00:14:44,710
by letting you chase your dreams.

238
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:47,880
Mom...

239
00:14:49,670 --> 00:14:53,790
It's me who should apologize. I was being too childish.

240
00:14:53,790 --> 00:14:56,250
I misunderstood you too many times

241
00:14:56,250 --> 00:14:58,150
and made stupid decisions.

242
00:14:59,370 --> 00:15:03,430
Mom, I am sorry.

243
00:15:08,300 --> 00:15:09,879
Stop with all these emotional talks.

244
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:13,840
Save them for your girlfriend.

245
00:15:31,150 --> 00:15:33,320
I will protect you from now on.

246
00:15:40,180 --> 00:15:43,340
Get back to work. Stop wasting time.

247
00:15:43,340 --> 00:15:45,200
Work.

248
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:56,449
Congratulations, our racing king has finally won his freedom back.

249
00:15:56,450 --> 00:15:58,660
- Don't be so dramatic.
- Don't forget to inform us about your matches.

250
00:15:58,660 --> 00:16:01,000
- We'll be there to cheer you on.
- I can be your cheerleader!

251
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:02,540
- Me, too.
- Me, too.

252
00:16:02,540 --> 00:16:06,180
For most people, being fired is a sad thing. But it seems to be a good thing for Jiaxin.

253
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:07,859
Come on, he is Master Gu.

254
00:16:07,859 --> 00:16:09,779
We should celebrate it for a bit, don't you think?

255
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:11,860
- Yes, of course.
- Sure.

256
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:14,590
- Today's dinner is on me.
- Nice!

257
00:16:14,590 --> 00:16:16,180
Nice!

258
00:16:16,180 --> 00:16:19,569
Wow, I guess we should thank Ms. Zhao today.

259
00:16:19,569 --> 00:16:22,765
Of course, you should. After tonight, I only have one identity now.

260
00:16:22,765 --> 00:16:24,615
Which one?

261
00:16:26,340 --> 00:16:28,425
Ms. Zhao's boyfriend.

262
00:16:30,265 --> 00:16:32,305
Oh my.

263
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:34,765
- That's enough.
- Come on, help him pack his things.

264
00:16:34,765 --> 00:16:39,214
- Yes, help me.
- Let's do this. The sooner we finish, the earlier we can have dinner.

265
00:16:42,030 --> 00:16:45,004
Since everyone is full now, let's play a game.

266
00:16:45,004 --> 00:16:47,685
- What game?
- Truth or Dare.

267
00:16:47,685 --> 00:16:50,765
If you lose, you drink a cup of alcohol.

268
00:16:53,170 --> 00:16:54,465
- That much?
- That's too much.

269
00:16:54,465 --> 00:16:55,954
Stop, that's too much!

270
00:16:55,954 --> 00:17:00,124
Move the plates aside. Now the game starts. Let me roll the bottle.

271
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:07,705
- Come on.
- Truth.

272
00:17:07,705 --> 00:17:11,325
You and Ms. Zhao, who confessed their feelings first?

273
00:17:11,325 --> 00:17:13,885
Is that really a question?

274
00:17:17,960 --> 00:17:21,085
I think it was... the time you got drunk.

275
00:17:21,085 --> 00:17:25,584
<i>I am so bad in love. I don't know how to maintain a relationship,</i>

276
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:31,104
<i>or how to love someone. It's been a long time...</i>

277
00:17:31,104 --> 00:17:34,564
It was my first time seeing you being sad.

278
00:17:34,564 --> 00:17:37,725
And I really wanted to...

279
00:17:37,725 --> 00:17:39,485
protect you.

280
00:17:44,110 --> 00:17:48,294
Seems like there are many things that we don't know.

281
00:17:50,025 --> 00:17:53,135
What about you, Little Aunt? When did you start having feelings for Jiaxin?

282
00:17:53,135 --> 00:17:55,135
When?

283
00:17:57,460 --> 00:18:00,504
<i>You are so different from what I thought you were.</i>

284
00:18:00,504 --> 00:18:03,615
<i>Well, you need to learn more about your subordinates.</i>

285
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:11,355
- I didn't lose, why do I have to answer?
- That's right.

286
00:18:11,355 --> 00:18:13,785
Come on, cheers.

287
00:18:19,300 --> 00:18:22,965
Jiaxin, we're trusting Ms. Zhao to you.

288
00:18:22,965 --> 00:18:24,374
- Treat her nicely.
- Of course.

289
00:18:24,374 --> 00:18:25,944
Okay, we are leaving.

290
00:18:25,945 --> 00:18:29,555
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

291
00:18:30,110 --> 00:18:33,685
Little Aunt, be happy.

292
00:18:33,685 --> 00:18:37,825
Don't worry! She won't be unhappy with my care.

293
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,445
Do you need me to drive you home? It's the same way.

294
00:18:41,445 --> 00:18:44,445
Go home? I haven't fully enjoyed myself yet.

295
00:18:44,445 --> 00:18:47,604
Shall we go to Yanran's home for another party?

296
00:18:47,604 --> 00:18:49,214
- Come on.
- Have fun, I won't go.

297
00:18:49,215 --> 00:18:50,524
Same here. I need to be with her.

298
00:18:50,524 --> 00:18:54,055
Look at them, eww. Let's get out of here, come on.

299
00:18:54,055 --> 00:18:57,450
<i>- Bye.
- Bye.</i>

300
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:02,035
Let's go home.

301
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:04,215
Not just yet.

302
00:19:05,340 --> 00:19:07,415
I have another plan.

303
00:19:09,825 --> 00:19:13,335
- Why did you bring me here?
- Go and check it out.

304
00:19:13,335 --> 00:19:15,544
- Come here.
- A motorcycle?

305
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:21,725
Remove the cover.

306
00:19:28,510 --> 00:19:30,175
Alice.

307
00:19:34,170 --> 00:19:36,585
That's my baby!

308
00:19:42,530 --> 00:19:45,055
I missed her.

309
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:47,614
Where did you get it?

310
00:19:47,615 --> 00:19:49,515
From your mom, of course.

311
00:19:49,515 --> 00:19:51,754
You are amazing. You made some alterations, too?

312
00:19:51,755 --> 00:19:54,585
Yes. I asked Zheng to do it.

313
00:19:54,585 --> 00:19:59,534
Now, you can finally enjoy your racing, and do whatever you want to do.

314
00:20:04,130 --> 00:20:07,355
- Thank you.
- Are you happy?

315
00:20:07,355 --> 00:20:11,095
Are you feeling good? Then kiss me.

316
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:27,810
♫ <i>Love me, love me</i> ♫

317
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:31,700
♫ <i>The right person... Oh, my true love</i> ♫

318
00:20:32,570 --> 00:20:36,749

It's not going to be easy.

Each division needs to come up with a work plan

according to your duties I just listed, and report to me as soon as possible.

345
00:23:13,035 --> 00:23:17,635
We will start with the pre-launch promotion activities to buy enough time for the IT Department

346
00:23:17,635 --> 00:23:19,854
to adjust and optimize the app.

347
00:23:19,855 --> 00:23:24,205
About the promotion of Qian Jingjing's comeback, the PR department has sent me a few plans.

If you have any more ideas, feel free to share them with me.

349
00:23:26,155 --> 00:23:29,894
The Queen Conference has gone viral on the internet recently.

350
00:23:29,905 --> 00:23:33,994
Its target audience greatly corresponds with

351
00:23:33,994 --> 00:23:37,065
our app's users, in terms of region, age, and interest.

352
00:23:37,065 --> 00:23:41,425
Many celebrities and influencers have become popular again

353
00:23:41,425 --> 00:23:43,564
by being on that show and roasting themselves.

354
00:23:43,564 --> 00:23:47,205
So I am thinking, maybe Ms. Jingjing can also be on that show

355
00:23:47,205 --> 00:23:49,604
as the first step of her comeback?

356
00:23:49,604 --> 00:23:51,484
That show is really popular, yes.

357
00:23:51,484 --> 00:23:54,444
But it also consists of mean guests and hosts.

358
00:23:54,444 --> 00:23:58,515
They make a big deal out of a tiny stain in someone's past.

359
00:23:58,515 --> 00:24:02,505
I think it's a good plan. I will talk about it with Jingjing later.

360
00:24:02,505 --> 00:24:05,335
If I don't receive better ideas this week, I might use this one.

361
00:24:05,335 --> 00:24:08,305
Make a detailed plan for me.

362
00:24:08,305 --> 00:24:12,924
Right. Let's start working on the new life of our app. Dismiss.

366

Every time you passed these bends, you hesitated about braking and accelerating.

367

Look at your curves.

00:25:17,825 --> 00:25:22,345
You keep making the same mistakes when you are tired.

369

I have told you so many times, but you never learn.

370
00:25:24,705 --> 00:25:26,255
If Kang Zhe listened to me back then...

371
00:25:26,255 --> 00:25:27,845
No.

372
00:25:30,235 --> 00:25:32,035

373
00:25:32,035 --> 00:25:33,375

Today's theme is not the same as the one you sent me before.

390
00:27:31,924 --> 00:27:34,535
I think it's discriminative. Can you change it?

391
00:27:34,535 --> 00:27:38,815
Ms. Zhao, our show is about self-roasting

392
00:27:38,815 --> 00:27:40,205
on controversies and bad stories.

393
00:27:40,205 --> 00:27:42,604
Also, our episodes are now competing with each other.

394
00:27:42,604 --> 00:27:46,634
If an episode is less attractive than the last one, it might be delayed.

395

It's for the show.

396
00:27:48,115 --> 00:27:51,524
Yes, Ms. Zhao, I communicated with the production team before about this.

397
00:27:51,524 --> 00:27:56,764
I think an attractive theme can help us wash the image of our app better.

398
00:27:56,764 --> 00:27:59,024
But Jingjing has just gone through internet bullying.

- I know.

Then why can't you accelerate instead of braking?

Because I keep thinking about Kang Zhe whenever I am there.

445

Sometimes, racing is not about defeating others.

Yes. I do have two faces.

00:32:01,765 --> 00:32:04,305
But one of them

455
00:32:04,305 --> 00:32:09,125
was thrown away when I was 19.

456
00:32:10,505 --> 00:32:14,995
I worked so hard to not go back to that time.

457
00:32:15,685 --> 00:32:18,824
I believe those photos of me being fat and ugly

458
00:32:18,824 --> 00:32:21,585
have already been made into memes

459
00:32:21,585 --> 00:32:23,795
and spread widely.

460
00:32:23,795 --> 00:32:28,595
Even I will use those ugly photo memes.

461
00:32:30,395 --> 00:32:34,285
That's right. I was a fat girl before.

462
00:32:34,285 --> 00:32:35,935
I loved dressing myself.

463
00:32:35,935 --> 00:32:38,435
I expressed my feelings only to get turned down.

464
00:32:38,435 --> 00:32:40,885
I was laughed at and bullied.

465
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:46,960
So I tried desperately to lose weight.

466
00:32:46,960 --> 00:32:50,050
I ate nothing, only drank water.

467
00:32:50,650 --> 00:32:55,180
Later, I passed out at home.

468
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:59,470
A good friend of mine found me and sent me to the hospital.

469
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:06,270
I just wanted to be loved.

470
00:33:06,270 --> 00:33:08,840
And I believe there are techniques for love.

471
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:11,470
I really want to find them

472
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:15,450
and help those like me

473
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:17,860
find love and happiness, too.

474
00:33:19,260 --> 00:33:21,810
But gradually, I lost myself.

475
00:33:22,920 --> 00:33:26,380
I considered people's love and attention

476
00:33:26,380 --> 00:33:29,440
as the only thing that mattered in life.

477
00:33:30,380 --> 00:33:32,770
But now, I finally understand

478
00:33:32,770 --> 00:33:34,970
the first step of finding true love

479
00:33:34,970 --> 00:33:37,210
is to accept yourself.

480
00:33:37,210 --> 00:33:40,740
You can only truly enjoy a journey with others

481
00:33:40,740 --> 00:33:44,160
when you can accept your true self.

482
00:33:44,160 --> 00:33:48,470
And the second step is to be brave.

483
00:33:48,470 --> 00:33:51,180
Be brave to love the ones you love.

484
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:55,170
And finally, what I want to say is

485
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:59,250
that true love is not about techniques,

486
00:33:59,250 --> 00:34:03,850
but a sincere heart.

<i>Where?</i>

644
00:43:58,590 --> 00:44:01,970
<i>Do you think you should listen to your parents' opinion about your love?</i>

645
00:44:10,040 --> 00:44:11,830
What's on your mind?

646
00:44:11,830 --> 00:44:13,549
You look sad.

647
00:44:13,549 --> 00:44:18,760
Qi Heng, do you think parents should intervene in their children's relationships?

648
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:25,710
I think, most parents just want their children to have a good life.

649
00:44:25,710 --> 00:44:28,719
They don't want their beloved children

650
00:44:28,719 --> 00:44:30,659
to be mistreated by others.

651
00:44:30,659 --> 00:44:32,859
But what if they want to control you

652
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:35,050
when they don't know a thing about your relationship?

653
00:44:35,790 --> 00:44:40,450
How about we look it up on Love Note?

654
00:44:46,660 --> 00:44:49,169
"When communicating with parents about relationships,

655
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:51,759
try to agree to disagree."

656
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:53,889
"You can't decide parents' standards

657
00:44:53,889 --> 00:44:56,139
but you should respect their opinions

658
00:44:56,139 --> 00:44:58,989
and express your feelings and thoughts clearly.

659
00:44:58,989 --> 00:45:01,990
Make them understand you have considered thoroughly,

660
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,330
instead of being impulsive."

661
00:45:04,330 --> 00:45:06,609
"Sometimes, as outsiders,

662
00:45:06,609 --> 00:45:09,419
parents can see through the weakness of your relationship better.

663
00:45:09,419 --> 00:45:12,619
So don't simply turn down their advice.

664
00:45:12,619 --> 00:45:15,509
Try to bring their perspective into your relationship

665
00:45:15,509 --> 00:45:17,479
and choose your loved one wisely.

666
00:45:17,479 --> 00:45:20,720
Don't be fooled by impulsiveness."

667
00:45:20,720 --> 00:45:23,759
Little fool, don't worry. I've got this.

668
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:26,070
We will face them together.

669
00:45:26,070 --> 00:45:27,620
Okay.

670
00:45:27,620 --> 00:45:29,410
Cheers.
