The woman makes Ms. Zhao feel uncomfortable by doing nothing.

She looks like the chairwoman in a novel.

126

Jiangyue, don't be impulsive.

167
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,800
Stay calm.

168
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:04,600
Jiangyue.

169
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:10,400
<i>I've taken care of the travel plans.</i>

170
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,700
<i>You just need to enjoy the food.</i>

171
00:11:11,700 --> 00:11:13,100
<i>Great.</i>

172
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:20,790
Jiangyue, don't be impulsive.

173
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,129
Jiangyue, listen to me.

174
00:11:23,130 --> 00:11:26,190
Close your eyes. Deep breath.

175
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:27,759
Control your emotions.

176
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,480
Don't be impulsive.

177
00:11:29,480 --> 00:11:31,350
I can't stay calm.

178
00:11:33,800 --> 00:11:35,390
Who is it?

179
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,610
Well.

180
00:11:54,030 --> 00:11:56,910
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

181
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:07,899
♪ Happy birthday to you. Happy birthday to you ♪

182
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:09,879
♪ Happy birthday! ♪

183
00:12:09,880 --> 00:12:11,830
- Happy!
- Happy!

184
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:14,130
I arranged this.

185
00:12:14,130 --> 00:12:16,370
Welcome!

186
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,250
Why are you still standing there?

187
00:12:20,250 --> 00:12:21,970
Go somewhere else!

188
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:24,779
I got it. Let's go, buddies. We will start the next round of the party.

189
00:12:24,779 --> 00:12:26,199
I will buy you drinks.

190
00:12:26,200 --> 00:12:29,170
Okay. Let's go.

191
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,840
Are you here for his birthday?

192
00:12:38,840 --> 00:12:41,830
I just saw you with Anna downstairs at the hotel.

193
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:45,319
No way. Do you think I came for Anna?

194
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:46,439
Otherwise?

195
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,239
Why would you both be here at the same time?

196
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,250
I'm being wronged.

197
00:12:50,250 --> 00:12:52,829
Anna has been staying at this hotel temporarily after she got back to China.

198
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,800
We just happened to meet each other.

199
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:57,000
What's the relationship between you?

200
00:12:57,000 --> 00:12:58,660
I heard that she is your ex-girlfriend.

201
00:12:58,660 --> 00:13:00,239
And she is back for you.

202
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:02,910
Who told you that?

203
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:12,550
It's fake.

204
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:14,509
Anna was harassed by a scumbag back then.

205
00:13:14,510 --> 00:13:18,760
I pretended to be her boyfriend and in return,

206
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,879
she did my Economics homework for me for the whole term.

207
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,559
I was busy racing.

208
00:13:23,560 --> 00:13:25,850
So I helped her out of kindness.

209
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:27,589
- Really?
- Yes.

210
00:13:27,590 --> 00:13:29,460
Definitely true.

211
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:31,030
No.

212
00:13:31,030 --> 00:13:33,079
I believe you are hiding something from me.

213
00:13:33,080 --> 00:13:35,790
My sixth sense is always precise.

214
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:47,300
Well.

215
00:13:48,470 --> 00:13:50,540
I'm hiding something.

216
00:14:07,270 --> 00:14:10,100
But it is not what you think.

217
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,370
It's about the company.

218
00:14:11,370 --> 00:14:13,180
The company?

219
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,780
What happened?

220
00:14:17,780 --> 00:14:22,000
After the accident of "Love Note," the head office met a severe financial crisis.

221
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:25,129
My mom thought about selling "Love Note" to stop the loss in time.

222
00:14:25,129 --> 00:14:28,259
She appointed me as acting president to finish the deal.

223
00:14:28,259 --> 00:14:31,930
<i>You must keep the financial status a secret.</i>

224
00:14:31,930 --> 00:14:35,540
<i>There are other companies that want to buy it.</i>

225
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:41,680
<i>If we fail, I will sell it to save the headquarters.</i>

226
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:46,289
I didn't tell you because I didn't want you to be worried.

227
00:14:46,289 --> 00:14:49,799
K. J. Capital that Anna represents learned about it somehow.

228
00:14:49,799 --> 00:14:52,140
She wants to buy it from me.

229
00:14:52,140 --> 00:14:54,589
That's why she keeps contacting me.

230
00:14:54,590 --> 00:14:58,279
To be honest, the conditions she provides are quite tempting.

231
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:00,349
<i>As long as you help me with the deal,</i>

232
00:15:00,350 --> 00:15:02,950
<i>I will invest in your dream.</i>

233
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,290
<i>I know you want the app.</i>

234
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:07,120
<i>But I can't sell it to you.</i>

235
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:08,800
<i>Why?</i>

236
00:15:13,000 --> 00:15:14,830
<i>Because of a person.</i>

237
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:19,780
<i>"Love Note" is her dream.</i>

238
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,770
<i>I want to finish it with her.</i>

239
00:15:23,770 --> 00:15:26,639
<i>We will make a new version of "Love Note."</i>

240
00:15:26,640 --> 00:15:28,240
<i>Please give me more time.</i>

241
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:32,610
<i>I will show you more "Love Note" potential.</i>

242
00:15:32,610 --> 00:15:34,370
<i>Well.</i>

243
00:15:34,370 --> 00:15:37,140
<i>If you can show me a persuasive plan,</i>

244
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,750
<i>I will consider your suggestion after I see its potential.</i>

245
00:15:40,750 --> 00:15:42,440
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

246
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:45,360
I planned to tell you after everything was done.

247
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:47,410
"Love Note" is your dream.

248
00:15:47,410 --> 00:15:50,050
How could I sell it?

249
00:15:51,390 --> 00:15:53,200
Sorry.

250
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:55,580
I misunderstood you.

251
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,300
It's okay.

252
00:15:57,300 --> 00:16:00,949
Being jealous is what love is.

253
00:16:00,950 --> 00:16:04,270
It's my pleasure to have you get jealous because of me.

254
00:16:04,270 --> 00:16:05,389
Annoying.

255
00:16:05,390 --> 00:16:09,040
To be serious, I have known Anna for years.

256
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:10,700
She is very realistic.

257
00:16:10,700 --> 00:16:12,920
And she does very well in business.

258
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:15,239
She won't do any deal which is not profitable.

259
00:16:15,240 --> 00:16:17,140
So I have been thinking about

260
00:16:17,140 --> 00:16:20,660
how we can get her to invest and save "Love Note."

261
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:25,569
We need to make an unprecedented update on our app.

262
00:16:25,569 --> 00:16:28,979
I just met Anna and wanted to talk about this with her.

263
00:16:28,979 --> 00:16:30,580
I agree.

264
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:34,929
I have been thinking about how we can update "Love Note."

265
00:16:35,530 --> 00:16:37,259
Let's go back to the company and work on it.

266
00:16:37,260 --> 00:16:39,830
We can discuss it. I have some new ideas.

267
00:16:39,830 --> 00:16:41,360
Okay.

268
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,050
I do like your serious look about work.

269
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,920
<i>[Duoxi]</i>

270
00:16:49,260 --> 00:16:50,169
Hello.

271
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,500
Hello, Little Aunt.

272
00:16:51,500 --> 00:16:54,289
Take a look at the article I just sent to you from your public account.

273
00:16:54,290 --> 00:16:55,630
<i>[Love Note May Be Acquired. One More Crisis For Link]</i>
It says

274
00:16:55,630 --> 00:16:58,080
<i>that "Love Note" may be acquired by K. J Capital.</i>

275
00:16:58,080 --> 00:16:59,940
<i>Is it real?</i>

276
00:16:59,940 --> 00:17:03,089
<i>The news has gone viral in the company's group chat. People are on tenterhooks.</i>

277
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:04,270
It is a rumor.

278
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:06,099
I will hold a meeting and tell everyone about that.

279
00:17:06,100 --> 00:17:07,750
No worries.

280
00:17:09,500 --> 00:17:12,080
What happened?

281
00:17:12,080 --> 00:17:13,870
Look at this.

282
00:17:21,770 --> 00:17:23,750
Did Anna leak it?

283
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:25,720
I think it is possible.

284
00:17:27,620 --> 00:17:28,990
Trust me.

285
00:17:28,990 --> 00:17:31,130
We will not lose.

286
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:35,790
<i>Mom, I can't sell "Love Note".</i>

287
00:17:35,790 --> 00:17:36,979
<i>Why?</i>

288
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:40,779
<i>Because it is what Zhao Jiangyue and all of the staff have worked so hard for.</i>

289
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:45,860
<i>You protected your lover's dream.</i>

290
00:17:47,250 --> 00:17:50,380
<i>I also want to protect Zhao Jiangyue's dream.</i>

291
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:23,219
Do you believe the news?

292
00:18:23,220 --> 00:18:25,850
Is "Love Note" going to be purchased?

293
00:18:25,850 --> 00:18:28,430
Will we have a new boss?

294
00:18:28,430 --> 00:18:30,049
You don't need to worry about that.

295
00:18:30,050 --> 00:18:32,600
The company is not going to go bankrupt. Right?

296
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:36,389
Even if the boss is changed, we still need to work.

297
00:18:36,389 --> 00:18:38,219
It won't be the same.

298
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,030
If it was purchased,

299
00:18:40,030 --> 00:18:42,619
the company's structure will be reorganized.

300
00:18:42,620 --> 00:18:44,889
We have no idea what will happen.

301
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:46,169
Stopping worrying.

302
00:18:46,170 --> 00:18:48,460
Ms. Zhao said that she will tell us in the meeting later.

303
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,700
We can ask her when she is here.

304
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:53,979
- Ms. Zhao.
- Ms. Zhao.

305
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:55,289
What happened?

306
00:18:55,290 --> 00:18:57,169
- Ms. Zhao.
- Jiaxin.

307
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,279
- What happened?
- Is the company going to be acquired?

308
00:18:59,279 --> 00:19:00,499
- Right?
- Will it be acquired?

309
00:19:00,500 --> 00:19:02,380
Don't worry.

310
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:06,169
To be honest, "Love Note" is facing a crisis.

311
00:19:06,170 --> 00:19:09,000
But it is not that serious, we will not lose it.

312
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:11,859
Everyone spent great effort on the app.

313
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,100
I hope we can work together in the future.

314
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:17,259
Ms. Zhao, we are relieved with your words.

315
00:19:17,259 --> 00:19:19,819
Ms. Zhao, "Love Note" is yours as well as ours.

316
00:19:19,820 --> 00:19:21,379
We are willing to go all the way with you.

317
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,289
If you need us, just tell us.

318
00:19:23,290 --> 00:19:26,619
No matter what, we will definitely advance and retreat together with "Love Note."

319
00:19:26,619 --> 00:19:29,049
- Right! Let's work together.
- Cheer up!

320
00:19:29,050 --> 00:19:30,320
Don't worry.

321
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,979
I promise on my reputation

322
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,130
that "Love Note" will not be bought easily.

323
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:36,979
Okay.

324
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,360
Well. Let's get to work!

325
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:40,620
Okay. Let's go.

326
00:19:55,410 --> 00:19:58,219
<i>Anna, did you release the news?</i>

327
00:19:58,220 --> 00:20:00,339
The news of the acquisition?

328
00:20:00,340 --> 00:20:01,979
I thought we reached an agreement

329
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,680
that you'd give me more time.

330
00:20:03,680 --> 00:20:05,859
The acquisition is probably not the best way.

331

<i>Jiaxin, believe it or not,</i>

332
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:10,370
it was not from me.

333
00:20:10,370 --> 00:20:13,979
But I don't mind the reactions of the market.

<i>I would like to trust you as a friend.</i>

338
00:20:22,820 --> 00:20:25,370
But as a business partner,

339
00:20:25,370 --> 00:20:27,889
it is hard for me to believe

Anna, I will show you a plan that satisfies you.

342
00:20:35,950 --> 00:20:38,760
Easier said than done.

343
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:41,540
I will give you one more week.

346
00:20:47,619 --> 00:20:49,290
Anna.

347

Don't worry. I will give you the plan this week.

348

You can talk to Anna first.

349
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:08,409
In the news, I saw lots of financial information

350
00:21:08,410 --> 00:21:11,919
which hasn't even been publicized within the company.

351
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:14,460
It is not what Anna can get.

352
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:20,500
Is there a spy?

Some fans have also commented below that it is her alternate account.

363
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:09,649
It does look like Qian Jingjing's apartment.

No. Mr. Gu asked you to go to his office.

368

Okay.

369

I don't want to hype Qian Jingjing.

I want to be the one who you can rely on.

I also want to spare no effort to solve the issues of the company.

She dropped a business card.

Isn't it the media that exposed the news of Qian Jingjing's divorce?

410

If Song Xue is the backstage manipulator, she is not doing it only to ruin Jingjing.

A co-worker asked me if it was your account.
<i>[Daily Sweets]</i>

443
00:27:07,650 --> 00:27:11,020
It gives more valuable tips for living than your official account does.

445

447
00:27:19,180 --> 00:27:21,110
I want to make a comeback for you.

What does Ms. Zhao think?

449
00:27:28,500 --> 00:27:32,920
Do you still remember when I was fat in high school?

450
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:36,450
I was mocked and bullied every day.

451
00:27:36,450 --> 00:27:41,430
It was you who protected me.

452
00:27:42,250 --> 00:27:45,670
Then I met Zhang Hao and got married to him.

453
00:27:45,670 --> 00:27:49,000
He takes good care of me in all aspects.

454
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:55,250
My first response was escaping when I divorced and affected the app.

455
00:27:55,250 --> 00:27:57,989
To be honest, I have avoided facing it for a long time.

456
00:27:57,989 --> 00:28:00,920
I want to be brave this time.

457
00:28:00,920 --> 00:28:03,500

There is strength in numbers.

463
00:28:16,110 --> 00:28:19,170
It's better than you two handling it alone.

464
00:28:19,700 --> 00:28:24,320
I had a conversation with Jingjing before we came here.

465
00:28:24,320 --> 00:28:30,579
I think the real love behind the fake news of Jingjing and Hao is very moving.

466
00:28:30,579 --> 00:28:32,459
We can start from this point.

467
00:28:32,460 --> 00:28:36,040
It is good for both Jingjing and us.

468
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,660
Well. Are you okay with that, Zhang Hao?

469
00:28:39,660 --> 00:28:41,250
Of course.

470
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:46,710
I was self-righteous and made many bad decisions.

471
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:51,359
It not only created many obstacles in our relationship but also affected your program.

I will listen to Jingjing.

473
00:28:54,130 --> 00:28:58,279
No matter what she does, I will stand with her firmly.

474

<i>[One-Day Countdown]</i>

499
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,240
Anna, what do you think about the plan?

500
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:34,200
Did you make it within a week?

501
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,859
Yes.

502
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:40,029
The time is limited, so there may be many imperfections.

503
00:31:42,500 --> 00:31:44,490
It's okay, Anna.

504
00:31:44,490 --> 00:31:47,100
You can tell us your thoughts.

505
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:53,010
I want you to explain the theme of the plan first.

506
00:31:55,320 --> 00:31:57,120
I will tell you a story.

507
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:01,690
There was a girl who was so good at work

508
00:32:01,690 --> 00:32:04,440
but was bad in love.

509
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:10,400
<i>She wanted to make "Love Note" work because she knew there were girls like her</i>

510
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:14,270
<i>in the world who knew nothing about love...</i>
<i>[Task: Not Single. Time Limit: Three Months]</i>

511
00:32:14,270 --> 00:32:16,380
<i>and need guidance about love.</i>

512
00:32:16,380 --> 00:32:21,129
<i>They think a tool teaching them love tricks</i>

513
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:26,350
and skills systematically can tell them the secret of love.

514
00:32:26,350 --> 00:32:31,550
Then she met a variable in her life.

515
00:32:31,550 --> 00:32:36,850
<i>The impossible love changed into loving her only.</i>

516
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:41,440
It made her realize that all the tricks and skills

517
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,600
are nothing in front of real love.

518
00:32:46,930 --> 00:32:51,930
Sincerity is the only path towards love.

519
00:32:51,930 --> 00:32:54,910
The program is her loving process.

520
00:32:54,910 --> 00:32:58,530
You are the variable, right?

521
00:32:58,530 --> 00:33:00,070
Yes.

522
00:33:00,750 --> 00:33:02,809
We want to make a new version of the app this time.

523
00:33:02,809 --> 00:33:04,669
It is updated in all aspects.

524
00:33:04,670 --> 00:33:08,929
We will change to mental guidance from technical guidance.

525
00:33:08,929 --> 00:33:10,869
We will add a socializing section to it.

526
00:33:10,870 --> 00:33:13,269
We will also revise the algorithm of big data

527
00:33:13,270 --> 00:33:17,509
to change the match-making from outer conditions to mental appeal.

528
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:21,269
They can join the matching group when they have the same preference.

529
00:33:21,269 --> 00:33:24,799
It allows people eager for love but who find it difficult to find love

530
00:33:24,799 --> 00:33:27,390
to meet the one with the same preference and goal.

531
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:35,730
To be honest,

532
00:33:35,730 --> 00:33:41,059
the program made within a week can't meet my criteria.

533
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:49,620
<i>Welcome!</i>

534
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,220
Okay. I will place the order for you.

535
00:34:02,570 --> 00:34:05,600
Sir, here you are.

536
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,050
Sir, I have a secret.

537
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,330
What is it?

538
00:34:17,330 --> 00:34:20,940
- I think I may have found the spy in our company.
- Wow.

539
00:34:20,940 --> 00:34:23,330
I happened to see it.

540
00:34:24,920 --> 00:34:26,770
I also have the voice record.

541
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:31,939
I am about to become the hero who saves the company.

542
00:34:31,939 --> 00:34:35,499
I have fully understood it after hearing what you told me last time.

543
00:34:35,499 --> 00:34:37,480
Though my love comes to nothing,

544
00:34:37,480 --> 00:34:41,160
I decided to save Gu Jiaxin for the last time.

545
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,600
Then I will walk away, which makes him remember me forever.

546
00:34:46,950 --> 00:34:49,489
Don't laugh. I mean it.

547
00:34:49,489 --> 00:34:51,620
Fortunately, I found the spy.

548
00:34:51,620 --> 00:34:54,779
Otherwise, the company would be ruined by those two women.

549
00:34:54,779 --> 00:34:58,200
May I listen to your evidence?

550
00:34:58,200 --> 00:35:00,890
I planned to listen to it with Gu Jiaxin.

551
00:35:00,890 --> 00:35:04,290
Since you are eager to do so

552
00:35:04,290 --> 00:35:07,430
and you are one of us, okay then.

553
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:09,560
I will let you listen to it.

<i>[Play]</i>

555
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,200

556
00:35:31,570 --> 00:35:33,590
Come to my office.

557
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:41,340
What did Anna say?

558
00:35:42,680 --> 00:35:45,120
What did she say?

559
00:35:45,120 --> 00:35:48,249
Hey. Say something!

560
00:35:48,249 --> 00:35:50,410
Did she turn us down?

561
00:35:51,370 --> 00:35:53,670
Say something! Why are you being silent?

562
00:35:53,670 --> 00:35:56,300
What did she say?

563
00:35:56,300 --> 00:35:58,210
She said...

564
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:02,859
- she agreed to let us make a new version.
- Really?

565
00:36:02,859 --> 00:36:04,570
Really! She agreed.

566
00:36:04,570 --> 00:36:07,669
She decided to invest in "Love Note" and support the revision.

567
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:09,240
Great!

568
00:36:09,240 --> 00:36:11,240
Let me show you something.

569
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,590
What's this?

570
00:36:15,380 --> 00:36:19,080
It is the same as the previous investigation. Song Xue is guilty.

571
00:36:19,080 --> 00:36:22,370
She told Anna our financial problem secretly

572
00:36:22,370 --> 00:36:26,199
and encouraged Anna to buy our app as an internal deal with her.

573
00:36:26,199 --> 00:36:28,790
Did Anna tell you about it?

574
00:36:28,790 --> 00:36:33,099
Though Anna wants to get our program, she is keeping an eye on Song Xue.

575
00:36:33,099 --> 00:36:36,919
Song Xue betrayed the company easily, so she won't believe in her.

576
00:36:36,919 --> 00:36:40,589
We reached an agreement now. She told me this as a favor.

577
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:44,750
This is the record of their communication.

578
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:51,360
It is the best beginning.

579
00:36:55,290 --> 00:36:59,540
Everything is possible because of you.

580
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,870
Gu Jiaxin.

581
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,700
What is it? Wait. Why didn't you knock on the door?

582
00:37:22,700 --> 00:37:28,260
Why don't you hang a Do-Not-Enter sign when you kiss?

583
00:37:29,189 --> 00:37:31,819
Yanran, did you come to Jiaxin for something?

584
00:37:31,820 --> 00:37:35,530
I suspect Anna and Song Xue are cooperating in secret.

585
00:37:35,530 --> 00:37:38,540
There is a spy in the company and it is Song Xue.

586
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,280
Tell me.

587
00:37:46,290 --> 00:37:49,870
I met them in a coffee shop

588
00:37:53,640 --> 00:37:56,060
and I have a voice record.

589
00:37:56,060 --> 00:37:59,610
Though there is no obvious evidence in it...

590
00:37:59,610 --> 00:38:01,990
<i>Did you have painless labor?</i>

591
00:38:01,990 --> 00:38:03,129
<i>How is it?</i>

592
00:38:03,129 --> 00:38:06,000
<i>Yes. No one can deny it.</i>

593
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,070
<i>I felt like was in heaven within a second.</i>

594
00:38:08,070 --> 00:38:11,190
<i>What does it mean?</i>

595
00:38:11,190 --> 00:38:15,460
<i>I felt less pain after the injection.</i>

596
00:38:15,460 --> 00:38:19,589
Though I did not record any valid evidence, I do suspect them.

597
00:38:19,589 --> 00:38:22,560
There are signs.

598
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:25,449
<i>As soon as the crisis happened, Song Xue went back to the company</i>

599
00:38:25,449 --> 00:38:27,370
<i>and took Jiangyue's position immediately.</i>

600
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,670
As soon as the crisis happened,

601
00:38:29,670 --> 00:38:32,459
Song Xue came back to the company and took Ms. Zhao's position immediately.

602
00:38:32,459 --> 00:38:34,570
<i>It's hard not to suspect that—</i>

603
00:38:34,570 --> 00:38:39,339
It's hard not to suspect that she did that in secret.

604
00:38:39,339 --> 00:38:42,160
What's more... Wy did Anna appear...

605
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:46,880
<i>exactly when Jin Yan was in the hospital? Isn't that too much of a coincidence?</i>

606
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:50,850
If Song Xue catches the chance and makes the deal,

607
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:52,440
she is very likely to...

608
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,770
<i>She is very likely to take over.</i>

609
00:38:54,770 --> 00:38:55,960
As she pleases...

610
00:38:55,960 --> 00:38:58,189
<i>She can control "Love Note" as she pleases.</i>

611
00:38:58,190 --> 00:39:01,440
In a word, Song Xue is quite suspicious.

612
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,120
I suggest that you have a thorough investigation.

613
00:39:06,090 --> 00:39:09,980
Yanran, great speech.

614
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:12,970
We already had the evidence.

615
00:39:17,330 --> 00:39:19,370
You already had the evidence?

616
00:39:19,370 --> 00:39:22,130
Anna gave it to me

617
00:39:22,130 --> 00:39:27,839
and Jiangyue found that Song Xue is to be blamed for Qian Jingjing's divorce.

618
00:39:27,839 --> 00:39:32,159
What a black sheep! Why did she do that?

619
00:39:32,159 --> 00:39:35,610
Ms. Jin is good to her.

620
00:39:40,370 --> 00:39:41,929
<i>Excuse me, I have to go to the restroom.</i>

621
00:39:41,929 --> 00:39:43,790
<i>Okay.</i>

622
00:39:45,720 --> 00:39:46,960
<i>Hello.</i>

623
00:39:46,960 --> 00:39:49,820
<i>Why didn't you send the baby to the hospital when he was sick?</i>

624
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:53,000
<i>He is suffering from a severe cough.</i>

625
00:39:55,330 --> 00:39:59,200
<i>You're busy. Are you the only one who is busy?</i>

626
00:40:01,570 --> 00:40:03,960
<i>Can't you think more about me?</i>

627
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:06,240
<i>If you weren't in heavy debt</i>

628
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:10,230
<i>and became a defaulter, would I have to work?</i>

629
00:40:10,230 --> 00:40:12,230
<i>Okay. I get it.</i>

630
00:40:16,130 --> 00:40:18,610
<i>What did I do to deserve this?</i>

631
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:28,740
A couple of days ago, I heard from my business partners

632
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:33,139
that Song Xue's husband's company was about to go bankrupt.

633
00:40:33,139 --> 00:40:36,980
She had no choice

634
00:40:36,980 --> 00:40:39,870
but to come back to the company.

635
00:40:39,870 --> 00:40:43,009
It was she who spared no effort to marry into the purple.

636
00:40:43,009 --> 00:40:45,030
She made it with her baby.

637
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:49,699
She is now betraying the company to obtain personal profit.

638
00:40:49,699 --> 00:40:52,630
I despise her.

639
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:58,310
In any case, thank you for your help.

640
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:02,750
I helped you just because...

641
00:41:06,440 --> 00:41:08,750
I will always help when seeing injustice.

642
00:41:08,750 --> 00:41:11,840
I am also a part of the company.

643
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,440
<i>[Murphy's Law of Love]</i>

644
00:41:39,720 --> 00:41:42,440
Have you heard of Murphy's Law of Love?

645
00:41:42,440 --> 00:41:45,929
-No.
- Are you talking about the psychological effect?

646
00:41:45,929 --> 00:41:48,189
If there is a chance for something to go wrong,

647
00:41:48,190 --> 00:41:51,319
it will always happen no matter how little the chance is.

648
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:52,440
Yes, that's it.

649
00:41:52,440 --> 00:41:56,360
The app said that Murphy's Law also works in love.

650
00:41:56,360 --> 00:41:58,130
What does it mean?

651
00:41:58,130 --> 00:42:02,840
When someone wants to cheat, temptation always appears.

652
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,240
It gets harder to maintain a relationship

653
00:42:05,240 --> 00:42:07,280
when it missed something at the beginning.

654
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:09,949
- Oh my god. It is so correct.
- Right?

655
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:12,110
And this. A person who is hard to get

656
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:16,219
will not be with you for a long time even if you make it.

657
00:42:16,219 --> 00:42:17,630
Really?

658
00:42:17,630 --> 00:42:20,389
Do I need to give up on my Prince Charming?

659
00:42:20,389 --> 00:42:23,820
- Don't you change it every day?
- No.

660
00:42:23,820 --> 00:42:25,110
Look at this. It is right.

661
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:28,189
Murphy's Law tells us humans are getting smarter.

662
00:42:28,189 --> 00:42:31,340
But it is never possible for a human to know about everything in this universe.

663
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:34,039
Making mistakes easily is a weakness born with us.

664
00:42:34,039 --> 00:42:37,099
In a relationship, there are things that we can't avoid.

665
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:40,822
What we can do is to stay true to the original self and cut losses in time.

666
00:42:40,822 --> 00:42:44,580
Well said! Let me read more.
