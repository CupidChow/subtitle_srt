163
00:14:28,530 --> 00:14:30,240
Yes!

164
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:35,009
Sir! Wine, please.

165
00:14:35,009 --> 00:14:38,280
Here you are, Ms. Zhao.

166
00:14:38,280 --> 00:14:40,220
Here's the Guangliang wine you ordered.

167
00:14:48,740 --> 00:14:50,280
Isn't it nice?

168
00:14:53,350 --> 00:14:55,699
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

169
00:15:02,080 --> 00:15:03,660
Zhang Duoxi!

170
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:06,969
- What?
- We were talking about the revolving restaurant at the beginning, right?

171
00:15:06,969 --> 00:15:08,320
Why are we back here?

172
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,040
Are you saving money for me?

173
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,980
The food here is delicious!

174
00:15:16,280 --> 00:15:18,909
We are aiming at increasing income and reducing expenses, aren't we?

175
00:15:18,909 --> 00:15:21,999
And I think for me, as long as I could dine with my love,

176
00:15:21,999 --> 00:15:24,079
it's always a feast no matter where or what we are eating.

177
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,390
How sweet you are!

178
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:28,660
How about this?

179
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:32,179
I will take you to buy a blind box tomorrow.

180
00:15:32,179 --> 00:15:33,770
Really?

181
00:15:33,770 --> 00:15:35,440
You are so nice!

182
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:40,770
Dig in!

183
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,910
Your favorite beef skewer.

184
00:15:46,130 --> 00:15:47,570
That's it?

185
00:15:49,500 --> 00:15:51,180
I will clean it.

186
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:56,739
- Here.
- That's more like it.
- Try it.

187
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:59,900
I'll also reward you with this then.

188
00:15:59,900 --> 00:16:02,349
Actually, I really miss the food here.

189
00:16:02,350 --> 00:16:04,130
Me too.

190
00:16:07,210 --> 00:16:10,129
About this cooperation plan, we have to be thoughtful.

191
00:16:10,129 --> 00:16:12,880
Focus more on the details.

192
00:16:14,640 --> 00:16:16,440
I need to take this call.

193
00:16:17,980 --> 00:16:20,309
- Hello?
<i>- Sir.</i>

194

I can't breathe!

198
00:16:28,619 --> 00:16:30,519
Come to comfort me now!

199
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:33,089
Why are you crying? Where are you?

200
00:16:33,089 --> 00:16:34,589
I'm outside your company.

201
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,390
Outside of my company?

202
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:40,299
All right. Wait there.

203
00:16:42,760 --> 00:16:46,230
Everyone, that's all for today's meeting.

204
00:16:46,230 --> 00:16:47,610
Dismissed.

205
00:16:47,610 --> 00:16:50,369
Mr. Xu, about the business dinner this evening...

206
00:16:50,369 --> 00:16:52,499
Decline it. It's only for drinking anyway.

207
00:16:52,499 --> 00:16:54,529
- Get off work early, everyone.
- But...

208
00:17:18,110 --> 00:17:21,300
Sir, look! They are really together!

209
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:24,529
- Keep your voice down.
- Our alliance to pursue love failed!

210
00:17:24,529 --> 00:17:27,079
We are all losers in love now.

211
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:29,700
Aren't you always a loser in love?

212
00:17:30,950 --> 00:17:33,280
Can you talk properly?

213
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:36,310
I became a complete failure in love just now.

214
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,259
Sir, if you are upset as well, you should be just like me.

215
00:17:41,259 --> 00:17:44,310
We can cry together. You don't need to feel ashamed.

216
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:46,010
You...

217
00:17:46,010 --> 00:17:49,209
Keep it down. There are people around.

218
00:17:49,209 --> 00:17:52,419
You are crying downstairs of my company, and they would reckon I did something to you.

219
00:17:52,419 --> 00:17:54,379
But I can't help myself!

220
00:17:54,379 --> 00:17:56,030
Try harder!

221
00:17:59,640 --> 00:18:01,650
All right.

222
00:18:01,650 --> 00:18:02,920
I will treat you to some really nice food

223
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,180
and comfort your broken heart later. All right?

224
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:09,200
Stopped crying?

225
00:18:09,200 --> 00:18:10,980
Let's go.

226
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:13,529
Sir, I'm really sad.

227
00:18:13,529 --> 00:18:17,989
Shouldn't you lend me your shoulder now so that I have something to rely on?

228
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,090
This is the room for you.

229
00:18:37,090 --> 00:18:38,810
The bedroom is this way.

230
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:41,360
I've made sure all your requests are met.

231
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,200
Why is there a kid's bed?

232
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:07,280
It's... It's the request of Ms. Zhao.

233
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:08,630
Right.

234
00:19:08,630 --> 00:19:10,739
I've asked the manager to add an extra bed.

235
00:19:10,739 --> 00:19:13,900
Otherwise, I'd feel bad if you slept on the floor.

236
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,439
Enjoy your stay, I'll leave you be now.

237
00:19:16,439 --> 00:19:18,080
Thank you.

238
00:19:19,330 --> 00:19:21,099
What do you think? Try your bed out.

239
00:19:21,099 --> 00:19:23,440
- See if you like it?
- Are you really doing this?

240
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:25,050
What else am I going to do?

241
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:27,330
You've arranged it all with the manager, right?

242
00:19:27,330 --> 00:19:30,179
If you are not happy about it, you can go somewhere else.

243
00:19:30,179 --> 00:19:31,950
I'm going to take a shower.

244
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,370
Wait a second.

245
00:19:40,040 --> 00:19:41,730
Shall I join you?

246
00:19:47,470 --> 00:19:49,370
Go away.

<i>I didn't pay attention to it,</i>

250
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:20,599
<i>but I think she would also be scared</i>

<i>I see.</i>

00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:58,959
<i>You sneaky one. Trying to scare me?<</i>

253
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:17,050
You are done? Come out.

00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,780
Dear,

255
00:21:24,040 --> 00:21:26,160
are you sleepy?

256
00:21:26,160 --> 00:21:27,760
Yes.

257
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,590
Go to bed then. Call me if you need me.

258
00:21:32,590 --> 00:21:33,950
You too.

259
00:21:33,950 --> 00:21:36,289
- Good night.
- Good night.

260
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,590
Sleep now.

261
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:02,260
Snake!

262
00:22:03,110 --> 00:22:05,560
There's a snake.

263
00:22:05,560 --> 00:22:09,520
But you still have to sleep in your own bed.

264
00:22:12,180 --> 00:22:14,540
I can't sleep alone.

265
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:18,970
You are not alone. The snake is with you.

266
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:23,520
How can you be so cruel?

267
00:22:25,310 --> 00:22:28,110
Am I not your boyfriend?

268
00:22:28,110 --> 00:22:30,740

269

270
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:40,080
Is what you said earlier a lie?

271
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:46,080
How's that possible? I wouldn't lie to you.

272
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,450
Wait a second.

That's right. Take a seat.

Honey, you look gorgeous today.

352
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:56,640
You are only wearing light makeup, right?

353
00:28:57,370 --> 00:28:59,160
I told you.

354
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,559
A light makeup suits you the most.

355
00:29:01,560 --> 00:29:03,950
So you don't need to get up so early

to do heavy makeup and try to be perfect in front of me.

It's not necessary. And you can get more sleep.

<i>That's right! Song Xue is creating chaos!</i>

What's wrong?

411
00:32:29,100 --> 00:32:31,380
She doesn't like Love Note at all.

412
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:33,170
She would love to see it gone.

413

414
00:32:36,679 --> 00:32:39,780
Well, let's come up with a proper solution first.

415
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:41,069

00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:04,390
I'm so tired.

429

It's been a long day.

430
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:09,310
Working really excites you.

431
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:11,430
I'm jealous.

432
00:34:12,660 --> 00:34:14,860
Stop it.

433
00:34:21,180 --> 00:34:24,000
We should take our wedding photos here in the future.

434
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:25,670
Look.

435
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:28,420
It's romantic.

436
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,370
We can talk about it when I decide to get married.

437
00:34:33,370 --> 00:34:35,520
What do you need to think about?

438
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:38,020
We are together now.

439
00:34:38,020 --> 00:34:40,280
Of course, we will get married.

440
00:34:40,870 --> 00:34:43,120
You are not regretting, are you?

441
00:34:46,470 --> 00:34:49,390
From now on, I will ask you every day.

442
00:34:49,390 --> 00:34:50,849
You will be annoyed.

443
00:34:50,849 --> 00:34:53,010
Gu Jiaxin,

444
00:34:53,910 --> 00:34:56,230
do you think that I can't deal with you?

445
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,170
How are you going to deal with me?

446
00:34:59,170 --> 00:35:01,600
I have my way.

447
00:35:03,290 --> 00:35:05,280
And what is it?

448
00:35:35,530 --> 00:35:37,050
You are up?

449
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:50,290
My queen, this is the breakfast especially made for you.

450
00:35:52,820 --> 00:35:55,840
I want to get more sleep.

451
00:35:55,840 --> 00:35:58,320
I'm not completely awake!

452
00:35:58,320 --> 00:35:59,870
Come here.

453
00:35:59,870 --> 00:36:01,950
Have some water first.

454
00:36:12,030 --> 00:36:13,870
Mr. Xu.

455
00:36:19,330 --> 00:36:20,810
All right.

456
00:36:21,940 --> 00:36:23,220
What's the matter?

457
00:36:23,220 --> 00:36:25,370
My mother had a heart attack.

458
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:45,520
<i>[From little devil to Rilakkuma]</i>

459
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:52,790
Recently on Love Note, there are always people asking

460
00:36:52,790 --> 00:36:56,029
why after a period of time together with their partners,

461
00:36:56,029 --> 00:36:57,839
the affection in the beginning

462
00:36:57,840 --> 00:37:00,270
would seem to decrease over time?

463
00:37:00,270 --> 00:37:04,039
Is there a way to maintain the sparks of love?

464
00:37:04,040 --> 00:37:07,799
Actually, it's absolutely normal to feel a contrast

465
00:37:07,800 --> 00:37:09,189
after two people get together.

466
00:37:09,190 --> 00:37:12,359
However, there is indeed a little trick

467
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:16,709
to allow your love experience to sustain longer and better.

468
00:37:16,709 --> 00:37:18,740
In the love theory of Love Note,

469
00:37:18,740 --> 00:37:23,369
this trick is called "From Little Devil to Rilakkuma."

470
00:37:23,369 --> 00:37:25,530
It means that in the beginning,

471
00:37:25,530 --> 00:37:29,079
you have to convince him that you are someone hard to get.

472
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:32,700
Don't be afraid to be a little devil before you are together.

473
00:37:32,700 --> 00:37:35,229
But when you are getting intimate,

474
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:36,869
you should let the man understand

475
00:37:36,870 --> 00:37:39,429
you are someone who allows him to feel at ease

476
00:37:39,430 --> 00:37:42,090
in daily life.

477
00:37:42,090 --> 00:37:47,839
Being the complete opposite of a little devil, you are now the Rilakkuma.

478
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:52,390
By switching between the two modes, he will be constantly amazed by you.

479
00:37:52,390 --> 00:37:56,259
