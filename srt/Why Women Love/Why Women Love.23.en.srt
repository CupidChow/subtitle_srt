Today, Jiaxin was invited by the Maidi Racing team to participate in the global tour.

If Kang Zhe were to wake up,

Right. Jiaxin, you should talk to Kang Zhe and stimulate him.

asked me to join them in the global race next year.

168

Jiangyue, you don't know. Maidi Racing is the world's top racing team.

00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,900
<i>Okay.</i>

320
00:25:25,600 --> 00:25:27,600
It was from Jingjing?

321
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:31,200
Jiangyue.

322
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:33,000
Though it was a mistake,

323
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,200
I'm proposing to you with sincerity.

324
00:25:35,200 --> 00:25:38,700
I planned to propose to you before I went abroad.

325
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:41,000
Why didn't you say yes?

326
00:25:44,600 --> 00:25:46,400
I think...

327
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:49,900
we just got together.

328
00:25:49,900 --> 00:25:51,400
It happened so fast.

329
00:25:51,400 --> 00:25:53,400
Don't deny me.

330
00:25:53,400 --> 00:25:56,400
We can take our time. Okay?

331
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:00,200
Please give me more time.

332
00:26:01,800 --> 00:26:03,000
Okay.

333
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:28,200
<i>I was rejected by Zhao Jiangyue just like that.</i>

334
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:03,370
<i>If a girl refuses your proposal,</i>

335
00:27:03,400 --> 00:27:07,600
<i>doesn't reply to messages, doesn't answers calls,</i>

336
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:09,400
<i>what does it mean?</i>

337
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:14,000
<i>[She doesn't love you.]
[She also likes someone else.]</i>

338
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:19,200
Nonsense.

339
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:25,300
<i>[Duoxi]</i>

340
00:27:26,700 --> 00:27:29,100
- Duoxi.
- Hello? Jiaxin.

341
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:32,100
What was going on between you and Little Aunt last night?

342
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:35,000
Same as you saw.

343
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:39,900
I was rejected and went home disappointed.

344
00:27:39,900 --> 00:27:41,000
Why?

345
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:42,600
<i>I have thought about it all night,</i>

346
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,200
but I still don't know why.

347
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:47,600
<i>I think Little Aunt may have some other plans.</i>

348
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:48,500
What do you mean?

349
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,800
Xu Ningyuan just came to the company without his secretary.

350
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,000
<i>I don't think he came here for work.</i>

351
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:54,800
<i>But I don't know about the details.</i>

352
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:56,400
Xu Ningyuan?

353
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:59,200
I think Little Aunt refused your proposal

354
00:27:59,200 --> 00:28:02,200
<i>because Xu Ningyuan is still in her mind more or less.</i>

355
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,400
No way. I have to check it out.

356
00:28:04,400 --> 00:28:06,000
Bye.

357
00:28:18,800 --> 00:28:22,000
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

358
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,600
Are you going to leave?

359
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:26,300
I will leave after the handover.

360
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,400
Good luck with your journey.

361
00:28:28,400 --> 00:28:29,900
Thank you.

362
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:34,100
The company will still cooperate with "Love Note."

363
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,800
You don't have to worry about it.

364
00:28:35,800 --> 00:28:38,700
If there is anything I can help with, just tell me.

365
00:28:38,700 --> 00:28:41,100
I will spare no effort.

366
00:28:41,100 --> 00:28:42,700
Thank you.

367
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:44,800
This time,

368
00:28:44,800 --> 00:28:47,800
I will not come back.

369
00:28:47,800 --> 00:28:49,100
What's the date of your flight?

370
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,000
Let's have dinner before you leave.

371
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:53,200
You treating me to dinner?

372
00:28:53,200 --> 00:28:55,600
Aren't you afraid that Gu Jiaxin may be mad at you?

373
00:28:57,000 --> 00:28:58,000
Forget dinner.

374
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:02,000
Let's have a formal farewell hug before I leave.

375
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:03,300
Okay.

376
00:29:07,400 --> 00:29:10,600
- What are you doing?
- Why are you here?

377
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,100
It's okay. I will protect you.

378
00:29:14,200 --> 00:29:15,600
Xu Ningyuan,

379
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:18,000
why do you visit Jiangyue when I am not around?

380
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
I should surely do that when you are not around.

381
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,800
Can I do that when you are around?

382
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:26,800
Okay. I am going abroad.

383
00:29:26,800 --> 00:29:28,400
Jiangyue is my best friend.

384
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:29,600
I'm here to say goodbye to her.

385
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,000
Okay. You have had your time.

386
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:33,600
Just leave.

387
00:29:34,800 --> 00:29:36,800
Good luck with your journey.

388
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:39,600
Thank you.

389
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:47,200
I heard someone spent all night preparing a proposal.

390
00:29:47,200 --> 00:29:49,400
Then he was rejected.

391
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,100
Amusing.

392
00:29:55,200 --> 00:29:56,600
Cheer up.

393
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:57,600
I will leave.

394
00:29:57,600 --> 00:29:59,400
Safe journey.

395
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,600
Why are you here suddenly?

396
00:30:07,400 --> 00:30:09,400
I was too hasty.

397
00:30:10,900 --> 00:30:12,800
I just wanted to ask you

398
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:15,400
if you refused my proposal because of Xu Ningyuan?

399
00:30:17,000 --> 00:30:19,800
Gu Jiaxin, are you a fool?

400
00:30:19,800 --> 00:30:22,900
Since the day I promised to be your girlfriend,

401
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:24,900
Xu Ningyuan has been out of my mind.

402
00:30:24,900 --> 00:30:26,800
I know.

403
00:30:26,800 --> 00:30:30,000
I'm insecure now because of your rejection.

404
00:30:31,300 --> 00:30:33,600
Why did you refuse my proposal?

405
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,800
I have thought about it all night and I still can't figure it out.

406
00:30:36,800 --> 00:30:39,100
Don't you want to marry me?

407
00:30:39,100 --> 00:30:41,700
It's not because of you.

408
00:30:42,600 --> 00:30:44,100
I don't...

409
00:30:45,000 --> 00:30:47,000
want to get married.

410
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,700
Why?

411
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:53,000
I haven't gotten used to the way we are together.

412
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:55,800
We will live together.

413
00:30:55,800 --> 00:30:57,700
We will have kids.

414
00:30:57,700 --> 00:30:59,600
We will have conflicts.

415
00:31:00,800 --> 00:31:03,000
I haven't got used to it.

416
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:08,400
<i>Keep your voice down.</i>

417
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,000
- What are you doing?
- Disappear.

418
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:14,400
Well, you should go back.

419
00:31:14,400 --> 00:31:16,500
We can talk later when I get back home.

420
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:18,400
- Wait.
- Quickly.

421
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:19,400
I... I miss you.

422
00:31:19,400 --> 00:31:21,800
Quickly! I know. We will talk tonight.

423
00:31:21,800 --> 00:31:23,400
Bye.

424
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:30,400
He doesn't even look at us.

425
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,000
I will reduce your salaries.

426
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:37,100
<i>- Let's leave.
- Let's leave.</i>

427
00:31:38,600 --> 00:31:41,000
I will not spoil you anymore.

428
00:31:47,000 --> 00:31:51,200
Are you okay with Jiaxin's proposal?

429
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,700
Sir, are you worried about me?

430
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:57,300
No.

431
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:59,000
Just asking.

432
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,100
I'm fine. I've got over him long ago.

433
00:32:01,100 --> 00:32:04,600
I am young and beautiful.

434
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:06,600
Why does it have to be him?

435
00:32:06,600 --> 00:32:09,200
People should live for themselves.

436
00:32:09,200 --> 00:32:10,700
It's good that you can think that way.

437
00:32:10,700 --> 00:32:14,400
I was afraid that you might cry when I leave.

438
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:17,800
You...

439
00:32:17,800 --> 00:32:20,400
Have you decided when to leave?

440
00:32:20,400 --> 00:32:22,000
I haven't bought the ticket.

441
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:24,000
In a day or two.

442
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,200
Why are you leaving in such a hurry?

443
00:32:26,200 --> 00:32:28,000
I still want...

444
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:32,600
I still have many restaurants that I want to bring you to.

445
00:32:32,600 --> 00:32:34,500
Then you shouldn't go.

446
00:32:34,500 --> 00:32:36,800
When you visit me, I will treat you to meals.

447
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:40,300
Okay.

448
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:42,200
Tell me about the date of your flight later.

449
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:43,200
I will drive you there.

450
00:32:43,200 --> 00:32:44,500
Okay.

451
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:50,400
You must change that bad habit of hitting people.

452
00:32:58,600 --> 00:33:01,900
Zheng Duoxi. What should I do?

453
00:33:01,900 --> 00:33:05,700
You two seemed to have exchanged your gender because of the relationship?

454
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,600
She is just like an unromantic man.

455
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:09,300
You're like a little girl with a sense of insecurity.

456
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:12,000
Qi Heng and I are so far away.

457
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,300
But I'm not as weak and fragile as you are.

458
00:33:13,300 --> 00:33:15,000
You don't understand.

459
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:18,200
Imagine. You especially prepare a wedding for Qi Heng.

460
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:20,200
But he just refuses it as soon as he sees it.

461
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:22,800
You wouldn't be calmer than I am now.

462
00:33:22,800 --> 00:33:25,000
Okay. Don't be so irritated.

463
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:27,300
I know you are sad.

464
00:33:29,400 --> 00:33:31,800
What matters is that I have to go abroad soon.

465
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:33,800
If Zhao Jiangyue doesn't accept my proposal,

466
00:33:33,800 --> 00:33:36,000
I can't practice with ease.

467
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:36,900
No.

468
00:33:36,900 --> 00:33:38,600
A heavy task in a pressing time.

469
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:40,500
I must marry her.

470
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,100
Should we turn to Jingjing? Maybe she can think of a way.

471
00:33:44,100 --> 00:33:45,800
Good idea.

472
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:56,400
<i>Jingjing.</i>

473
00:33:56,400 --> 00:33:57,800
<i>Hello, Jingjing.</i>

474
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:00,600
<i>Jingjing, Gu Jiaxin's proposal was rejected.</i>

475
00:34:00,600 --> 00:34:03,400
<i>You have something to do with it. Can you help him?</i>

476
00:34:03,400 --> 00:34:06,500
Jingjing, please save me.

477
00:34:06,500 --> 00:34:09,200
Do you have love guidance for men?

478
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:11,800
Tell me. Why did you get rejected?

479
00:34:11,800 --> 00:34:14,800
Little Aunt said that she only wants to enjoy the happiness of being in a relationship.

480
00:34:14,800 --> 00:34:16,400
<i>Did she really say that?</i>

481
00:34:16,400 --> 00:34:19,700
It looks like she has grown up.

482
00:34:19,700 --> 00:34:21,800
<i>She said it was not because of me.</i>

483
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,600
<i>She just doesn't want to get married.</i>

484
00:34:23,600 --> 00:34:26,700

486
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,400
Turns out in your relationship,

487
00:34:30,400 --> 00:34:33,700
Jiangyue is not the one who wants to get married but you!

488
00:34:33,700 --> 00:34:36,500
<i>I think you should not rush this.</i>

489

<i>What do people who fear marriage care about?</i>

490
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:41,700
They are usually afraid of losing themselves

491
00:34:41,700 --> 00:34:45,600
in an intimate relationship because they have to merge their own life

492

<i>with their partners'.</i>

493
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:48,600
Jingjing.

494
00:34:49,100 --> 00:34:51,450
What should I do specifically?

495
00:34:51,450 --> 00:34:54,770
You can consider trial marriage and living together.

496
00:34:54,770 --> 00:34:57,250
<i>After you stay in the same place for a long time,</i>

497
00:34:57,250 --> 00:35:01,050
Jiangyue might get used to being in a marriage.

498
00:35:01,050 --> 00:35:03,070
Good idea.

499
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:04,829
No way. It's not up to me.

500
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,259
- Please help me.
- Okay, no problem

<i>All in all, take it easy.</i>

502
00:35:09,210 --> 00:35:12,509
You know it, Jiangyue's character is on slow and simmer.

503
00:35:12,509 --> 00:35:16,040
I'll count my life-long happiness on it.

504
00:35:16,040 --> 00:35:17,520
Thank you, Jingjing.

505
00:35:17,520 --> 00:35:19,619
You're welcome. Keep up the good work.

506
00:35:19,619 --> 00:35:21,590
Bye, Jingjing.

507
00:35:22,860 --> 00:35:25,999
Okay, I will get back to prepare.

508
00:35:25,999 --> 00:35:28,020
Please help me convince her.

509
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,620
Where are you going?

510
00:35:45,620 --> 00:35:47,320
I'm homeless.

511
00:35:47,320 --> 00:35:49,040
You must take me in.

512
00:35:50,010 --> 00:35:51,620
Come in.

513
00:35:51,620 --> 00:35:53,730
What happened?

514
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:58,400
Forget it.

515
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,919
My landlord said he needed to take the apartment back for his marriage.

516
00:35:59,919 --> 00:36:02,950
He won't renew my lease.

517
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,020
He told me it was not about money.

518
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:10,959
- Come in and arrange your belongings.
- Okay.

519
00:36:10,959 --> 00:36:13,369
- You unpack it.
- Okay.

520
00:36:15,590 --> 00:36:17,290
Let's go.

521
00:36:45,770 --> 00:36:48,350
You woke up.

How was your sleep?

523
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:51,530
Pretty good.

Take a seat.

Water with honey.

527
00:37:15,530 --> 00:37:19,120
Did you make these?

528
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:27,520
It is heart-shaped.

529
00:37:56,250 --> 00:37:59,240
Just focus on your work, I will handle the chores.

530
00:37:59,240 --> 00:38:01,190
Don't you need to practice racing?

531
00:38:01,190 --> 00:38:04,450
<i>I have no mood for practicing unless you accept my proposal.</i>

532

I'm on vacation.

533

I will accompany you attentively.

534
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:11,289
Okay. Wait for my return.

Ms. Zhao, are you always so romantic at home?

556
00:41:07,249 --> 00:41:08,330
You dropped the flower.

Come on. Hold it in your mouth.

558
00:41:10,150 --> 00:41:11,769
- Hold it.
- No.

559
00:41:11,769 --> 00:41:16,720
Jiaxin and Ms. Zhao are already living together?

560
00:41:16,720 --> 00:41:20,969
It is so touching. You prepared the meal knowing that we were going to visit.

561
00:41:20,969 --> 00:41:22,420
So many dishes!

562

Welcome. Come on. Take your seats. Please sit down.

569
00:41:35,870 --> 00:41:37,970
I came back early.

I didn't expect that Jiaxin could cook.

574
00:41:49,140 --> 00:41:51,339
- Neither did I.
- Just a little.

575
00:41:51,339 --> 00:41:54,260
It is a bit awkward. Right?

576
00:41:54,260 --> 00:41:57,759

- Yes.
- I will cook two more dishes.

00:42:01,339 --> 00:42:03,550
Prepare some baijiu.
("Bai" means white)

580
00:42:03,550 --> 00:42:04,770
Here you go, white.

581
00:42:04,770 --> 00:42:08,769
- White!
- It's too white.

582
00:42:08,769 --> 00:42:10,279
- Just a few minutes.
- Okay.

583
00:42:10,279 --> 00:42:12,770
Are Jiaxin's dishes edible?

584

A fan asked us a question.

587
00:42:34,850 --> 00:42:37,820
A friend of someone she used to date is getting married.

588
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:41,050
When they were having dinner together, she realized that he was

589
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:43,550
a good man who was family-oriented and made a lot of money.

590
00:42:43,550 --> 00:42:49,490
Why didn't she find out on the previous dates?

591
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,020
That's a good question.

592

On the first date, we will grade each other with their ability.

595
00:43:03,200 --> 00:43:05,940
For example, not properly dressed.

597
00:43:07,700 --> 00:43:10,400
Inappropriate restaurant. Points deduction.

Points deduction.
