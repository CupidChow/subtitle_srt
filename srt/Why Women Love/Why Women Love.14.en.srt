00:14:30,449 --> 00:14:32,890
between "peace of mind" and "heartbeat."

214
00:14:32,890 --> 00:14:35,149

[Jingjing's Love Academy]</i>

216
00:14:38,059 --> 00:14:40,439
"Heartbeat" is like riding a roller coaster,

217
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,009
giving you violent heart palpitations and a rush of excitement.

218
00:14:44,009 --> 00:14:46,740
But "peace of mind" is like being on a parachute.

219

No matter how high you fly, you can land safely.

<i>I like you.</i>

222
00:14:58,000 --> 00:14:59,839
It's easy for someone to give you a "heartbeat,"

223
00:14:59,840 --> 00:15:02,010
but it's not the case for "peace of mind."

224
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:04,789
Why are scumbags always so attractive?

225
00:15:04,790 --> 00:15:08,689
That's because they know how to let you experience a "heartbeat."

00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:14,370
"Women's beauty, steel roses."

316
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:18,159
This is expected of the women's army under Ms. Jin.

317
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,070
I couldn't tell...

318
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:23,760
that you are actually a heroine at the wine table, too.

319
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,880
Since Mr. Liu has given me reassurance, I must show my sincerity.

320
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:29,299
Speaking of sincerity, it so happens

321
00:20:29,299 --> 00:20:31,679
that these buddies in the advertising industry

322
00:20:31,680 --> 00:20:34,179
would like to get to know you better.

323
00:20:34,179 --> 00:20:36,709
Let's move to the karaoke room now,

324
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:39,330
so we can get to know one another more.

325
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,069
Sorry, I won't be going. Please go ahead.

326
00:20:41,069 --> 00:20:42,919
I... I still have some work to settle.

327
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:45,510
Don't spoil the fun.

328
00:20:47,190 --> 00:20:49,509
- Join us.
- I won't be going.

Ms. Zhao, Ms. Jin has a teleconference

330
00:21:11,940 --> 00:21:14,310

It seems that Ms. Zhao is really busy with business matters.

333
00:21:20,820 --> 00:21:23,290
- Work is more important.
- Okay.

334
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:25,330
- You guys go ahead.
- All right, we'll meet again next time.

335
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:26,970
- Ms. Zhao, see you next time.
- Go on. Go get busy.

336
00:21:26,970 --> 00:21:28,600
Goodbye.

Your hand.

How come you're here?

348
00:22:13,540 --> 00:22:15,400

Looks like you've got a number of spies in the company.

352
00:22:31,310 --> 00:22:33,970
What happened? Went drinking when you have a cold?

353
00:22:33,970 --> 00:22:35,660
Is your life not important?

I feel horrible.

359
00:23:40,430 --> 00:23:41,940
It's hot.

360
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:47,080
Still having a fever.

361
00:23:50,470 --> 00:23:52,350
Are you hungry?

362
00:23:52,350 --> 00:23:54,090
Have some porridge.

Can you stop thinking about work?

366
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:04,500
You need to rest now.

367
00:24:04,970 --> 00:24:08,350
I can help you sort things out, okay?

368
00:24:08,350 --> 00:24:12,079
Don't think about work. Rest.

You've kept such a big secret from us.

- Ms. Zhao is here.

- Ms. Zhao, hello.

- Ms. Zhao.
- Ms. Zhao, how's your cold?

399
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:29,279
Let me just say a few words.

400
00:27:29,280 --> 00:27:31,829
The theme of our offline event this time is

401
00:27:31,830 --> 00:27:34,229
"Being lovelorn does not exist in the world of adults."

402
00:27:34,230 --> 00:27:38,279
We will collect lovelorn souvenirs and stories from our members,

403
00:27:38,279 --> 00:27:43,799
plan and organize a lovelorn museum, plus a breakup counseling session to interact with members offline.

404
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:46,589
Ms. Zhao, can we employees donate something, too?

405
00:27:46,590 --> 00:27:48,679
Of course, as long as you're a member.

406
00:27:48,680 --> 00:27:49,930
That's great.

407
00:27:49,930 --> 00:27:52,169
This event has been upgraded and there's a bigger venue.

408
00:27:52,169 --> 00:27:54,959
Those from the Project Department might have to step in and help.

409
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:58,000
Ms. Zhao, we have sorted out the donated items and users' messages,

410
00:27:58,000 --> 00:28:01,119
which are now in the logistics warehouse.

411
00:28:01,119 --> 00:28:02,189
Good.

412
00:28:02,190 --> 00:28:03,799
Complete your tasks at hand.

413
00:28:03,800 --> 00:28:05,890
We'll assign the duties at the venue tomorrow.

414
00:28:05,890 --> 00:28:07,580
All right.

415
00:28:14,130 --> 00:28:16,080
Come to my office.

416
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,820
Come in.

417
00:28:32,610 --> 00:28:35,680
Thanks for helping me to organize Chengxing's information.

418
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,040
It's my duty.

419
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:44,730
Well... I didn't mean to find out your secret.

420
00:28:44,730 --> 00:28:46,010
I'm sorry.

421
00:28:46,010 --> 00:28:47,980
You're upset?

422
00:28:56,710 --> 00:28:58,790
So what are you going to do next?

423
00:28:58,790 --> 00:29:00,910
The one with the low score...

424
00:29:02,290 --> 00:29:04,730
will get eliminated by you, right?

425
00:29:06,230 --> 00:29:10,329
- This is not my intention...
- To you, I'm just an unqualified defective product.

426
00:29:11,210 --> 00:29:13,310
My feelings for you...

427
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:16,520
are just data on a chart?

428
00:29:17,430 --> 00:29:22,770
You can't feel my sincerity at all?

429
00:29:23,760 --> 00:29:28,480
Instead, you need those cold numbers

430
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,350
to tell you what love is.

431
00:29:31,400 --> 00:29:34,380
I don't know what love is.

432
00:29:36,430 --> 00:29:39,020
I don't know how to tell you.

433
00:29:40,230 --> 00:29:42,280
You deserve a lonely life...

434
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:46,100
with this level of love incompetency.

435
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:06,450
It's about Gu Jiaxin again?

436
00:30:06,450 --> 00:30:07,910
What do you think?

437
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:11,399
I've been meeting you more than Jiangyue.

438
00:30:11,400 --> 00:30:14,109
You're really taking love as a career,

439
00:30:14,110 --> 00:30:15,759
and career as a hobby.

440
00:30:15,760 --> 00:30:17,679
Love is my belief.

441
00:30:17,680 --> 00:30:23,810
So, what can I do for your belief this time?

442
00:30:24,950 --> 00:30:28,660
This time, I'm serious about working with you.

443
00:30:28,660 --> 00:30:31,190
Please sign this proposal.

444
00:30:31,190 --> 00:30:33,530
Another new project?

445
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:36,039
<i>[Love alliance plan]</i>
Love alliance plan?

446
00:30:36,040 --> 00:30:36,999
When did you do this?

447
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:40,710
Last night, I was up all night working on it.

448
00:30:40,710 --> 00:30:44,370
Party A is Li Yanran and Party B is Xu Ningyuan.

449
00:30:44,370 --> 00:30:49,159
The cooperation goal is to help each other to pursue their love.

450
00:30:49,159 --> 00:30:53,499
Li Yanran will help Party B, Xu Ningyuan, in pursuing Zhao Jiangyue.

451
00:30:53,499 --> 00:30:56,309
Let me tell you! My love radar tells me

452
00:30:56,310 --> 00:31:00,529
that there must be some kind of misunderstanding between Zhao Jiangyue and Gu Jiaxin.

453
00:31:00,600 --> 00:31:04,200
One man's loss is another man's gain. You stand a better chance.

454
00:31:04,270 --> 00:31:06,210
So?

455
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:11,000
Well, I feel that our verbal alliance was a bit informal.

456
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:15,489
I think you would choose to back out if you can't win Ms. Zhao's heart.

457
00:31:15,489 --> 00:31:20,009
After all, you're someone who's concerned about losing face and is usually not very considerate.

458
00:31:20,009 --> 00:31:23,129
Besides, you always keep a straight face and look serious.

459
00:31:23,129 --> 00:31:26,879
Take a look at yourself, you don't have a sense of humor.

460
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:29,039
I know it's hard for both of us.

461
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:30,799
But that's what it takes to be in love.

462
00:31:30,800 --> 00:31:32,829
You have to persevere.

463
00:31:32,830 --> 00:31:35,680
So, you mustn't give up.

464
00:31:37,430 --> 00:31:38,709
I didn't say I was giving up.

465
00:31:38,710 --> 00:31:40,670
But I'm not giving up either.

466
00:31:40,670 --> 00:31:44,240
I have already planned to confess to Jiaxin again.

467
00:31:44,240 --> 00:31:46,010
Another confession?

468
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:48,779
- How are you going to do it?
- It's a secret.

469
00:31:48,779 --> 00:31:51,930
When you end up with Ms. Zhao, I'll let you know.

470
00:31:55,830 --> 00:31:59,170
It's not that I can't sign it.

471
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:03,179
- Since it's cooperation, it must be mutually beneficial.
- That's right.

472
00:32:03,179 --> 00:32:07,530
So what are my benefits and gains?

473
00:32:08,710 --> 00:32:13,869

Hello, Ms. Jin. I'm Yanran.

Tell me.

498
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,400
I think since we're staying together now,

00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,600
we can actually get a love bank card.

500

Put some money in it every month,

Actually, I overheard your conversation.

You paid the rent secretly

506

Don't worry about it. I have a solution.

507

Let's dig in.

508

If I can't even support the woman I love, how can I accept that?

512
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,500
Don't worry about it. Just relax.

513

You can keep your salary for yourself.

No way, I'll work hard with you.

Jiaxin has made great progress in his work recently.

528
00:35:34,600 --> 00:35:36,700
He reported for work as soon as his leg healed.

In fact, today,

00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:49,200
I want to talk to you about him as a mother.

534
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,700
What do you think of him?

535
00:35:52,600 --> 00:35:54,200
He is smart,

536
00:35:54,200 --> 00:35:57,000
energetic, and takes his work seriously.

537
00:35:57,000 --> 00:35:58,600
His colleagues like him a lot.

538
00:35:58,600 --> 00:36:01,600
It seems that you have a certain level of understanding about him.

539
00:36:01,600 --> 00:36:05,100
You are the youngest general manager in the history of Link Technology,

540
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:07,400
and also my most capable right-hand person.

541
00:36:07,400 --> 00:36:11,200
Do you remember asking me what a woman needs

542
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,000
in order to be successful?

543
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,800
Putting work as the first priority.

544
00:36:15,800 --> 00:36:18,800
Let me be open with you.

545
00:36:18,800 --> 00:36:22,000
Jiaxin is still young and fun-loving.

546
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:25,200
His enthusiasm doesn't usually last long.

547
00:36:25,200 --> 00:36:27,000
You're different.

548
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,000
You're capable, driven,

549
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,000
and you have a future beyond measure.

550
00:36:32,000 --> 00:36:34,200
Objectively speaking,

551
00:36:34,200 --> 00:36:36,500
Jiaxin is not worthy of you.

552
00:36:37,700 --> 00:36:40,400
Ms. Jin, you're saying...

553
00:36:40,400 --> 00:36:43,800
Your scandal with him has already reached me.

554
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:46,200
We're not in a relationship.

555
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:47,400
Fine.

556
00:36:47,400 --> 00:36:51,300
I hope you can assure me that your relationship with him

557
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,500
will remain as superior and subordinate.

558
00:36:56,400 --> 00:37:01,000
I assure you that I will devote myself to my work from now on,

559
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:04,700
and Jiaxin and I will stay as colleagues.

560
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:08,600
Here, have some soup. I boiled it all afternoon.

561
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:10,000
Okay.

562
00:37:32,200 --> 00:37:36,400
<i>You deserve a lonely life with this level of love incompetency.</i>

563
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:39,600
Was I too harsh with my words?

564
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,000
<i>I don't think so.</i>

565
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:04,000
<i>Is that true?</i>

566
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,000
- Ms. Zhao.
- Hi, Ms. Zhao.

567
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:08,600
<i>Is it a May-December romance?</i>

568
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:12,200
<i>She's quite good-looking.</i>

569
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:16,000
It's about Ms. Zhao and Gu Jiaxin...

570
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:17,000
Ms. Zhao and Li Yanran

571
00:38:17,000 --> 00:38:18,600
are fighting over the inheritor of our company.

572
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:19,800
- Really?
- Is that true?

573
00:38:19,800 --> 00:38:21,100
Who do you think...

574
00:38:21,100 --> 00:38:23,400
Who do you think is going to win?

575
00:38:24,700 --> 00:38:27,400
- Morning, Ms. Zhao.
- Ms. Zhao, good morning.

576
00:38:27,400 --> 00:38:30,700
This is simply an idol drama happening around me in real life.

577
00:38:30,700 --> 00:38:34,000
"The personal male assistant turned into the inheritor of the company,"

578
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,700
and "The domineering young master fell in love with me."

579
00:38:39,100 --> 00:38:42,100
Well, Gu Jiaxin is actually the son of our boss.

580
00:38:42,100 --> 00:38:45,000
No wonder he can win Ms. Zhao over.

581
00:38:45,000 --> 00:38:46,500
If it were the two of you,

582
00:38:46,500 --> 00:38:48,600
would you choose Ms. Zhao or Yanran?

583
00:38:48,600 --> 00:38:51,400
It's hard to say. Ms. Zhao is so shrewd...

584
00:39:00,000 --> 00:39:01,600
Come in.

585
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:38,200
<i>[Compatibility or Heartbeat?]</i>

586
00:39:41,800 --> 00:39:42,900
"Compatibility," of course.

587
00:39:42,900 --> 00:39:45,600
It easily gives people a sense of security.

588
00:39:45,600 --> 00:39:47,800
But I feel that if you no longer experience a "heartbeat" for the other party,

589
00:39:47,800 --> 00:39:50,700
there's no motivation in staying together.

590
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:53,200
What are you guys doing?

591
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:55,400
We are discussing whether a couple in love

592
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,000
should choose "compatibility" or "heartbeat."

593
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,200
Both, of course. Silly.

594
00:40:02,200 --> 00:40:04,900
According to Love Note,

595
00:40:08,040 --> 00:40:10,599
if there's only "compatibility" without "heartbeat,"

596
00:40:10,600 --> 00:40:13,669
the couple will lack the passion to explore each other.

597
00:40:13,670 --> 00:40:16,079
But what if there's only "heartbeat" without "compatibility"?

598
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:18,400
In the beginning, they'll indulge in burning passion.

599
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:21,400
But in the long run, due to differences in mentality,

600
00:40:21,400 --> 00:40:24,800
the initial affection will eventually be disintegrated by the conflicts

601
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:26,400
<i>[Disintegrated]</i>
in everyday life.

602
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:29,200
In the end, both will part ways by saying,

603
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:31,800
"Let's break up, we're not compatible."

604
00:40:31,800 --> 00:40:33,600
Therefore...

605
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:38,989
Therefore, whether for "compatibility" or "heartbeat,"

606
00:40:38,989 --> 00:40:41,800
it must be based on mutual liking.

607
00:40:41,800 --> 00:40:44,400
If there is only a "heartbeat" without love,

608
00:40:44,400 --> 00:40:45,800
then it's just friendship.

609
00:40:45,800 --> 00:40:48,000
What if there's "compatibility" without love?

610
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:51,900
Then the two are at best, living together as good friends.

611
00:40:51,900 --> 00:40:56,400
You guys need to learn more from Ms. Yanran.

612
00:40:56,400 --> 00:40:59,400
I'm extremely worried for you guys.
