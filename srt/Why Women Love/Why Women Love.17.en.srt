Jingjing's divorce triggered a crisis.

Let's start the investigation from here.

47
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:46,880
Who do you think is behind this?

48

Zhao Hao?

50
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:53,549
I think so too. Although they had been divorced,

51
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:56,980
to the public, they were still husband and wife.

52
00:02:56,980 --> 00:03:00,260
Could it be that he wanted to get back at Jingjing

53
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:03,130
for being humiliated by the Vincent matter?

54
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:05,450

Why did you come to me specifically because of her?

94
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,649
<i>[36 Tips for Love]</i>
that sometimes, the subtext of rejection

95
00:05:09,649 --> 00:05:11,209
is a retreat in order to advance.

96
00:05:11,209 --> 00:05:14,570
It represents an attitude of wanting to accept but pretending to reject.

Let's continue to learn more.

99
00:05:22,299 --> 00:05:26,149
For a man, the greatest allure for him is being a mystery,

00:05:26,149 --> 00:05:28,140
such as the unknowable.

101
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:31,929
Wouldn't it be a turnoff if a woman let a man see right through her at a glance?

102
00:05:31,929 --> 00:05:36,570

00:08:17,920 --> 00:08:19,550
Handsome!

161
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:26,420
Your leg, put your leg out.

162
00:08:26,420 --> 00:08:29,439
So long. Okay, handsome.

163
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,779
- Let's have a close shot.
- Here, close shot.

164
00:08:34,790 --> 00:08:36,470
Okay, good.

165
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:38,880
It's great.

166
00:08:38,880 --> 00:08:40,919
- What are these...
- How nice!

167
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:42,670
Quickly, send them to her.

168
00:08:42,670 --> 00:08:44,580
Fine. Next.

169
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:46,079
You continue to send gifts to her.

170
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,100
I'll ask her to meet me offline.

171
00:08:50,670 --> 00:08:53,509
How do I send her gifts? I don't know how.

172
00:08:53,509 --> 00:08:55,349
Stupid girl, see?

173
00:08:55,350 --> 00:08:56,990
Here, see?

174
00:08:56,990 --> 00:08:59,829
Click here. Go easy on it, it's expensive.

175
00:08:59,829 --> 00:09:03,509
I won't. Here, I'm sending.

176
00:09:03,509 --> 00:09:08,650
Rocket. Rocket! Rocket!

177
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:10,309
- It's almost enough.
- No way!

178
00:09:10,309 --> 00:09:13,839
You have to send more to make her take the bait and get her attention.

179
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:16,779
- Don't send too much.
- Come on, I won't.

180
00:09:20,550 --> 00:09:23,220
This much?!

181
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:26,010
What's with the complaint?

182
00:09:27,840 --> 00:09:31,170
<i>[WUER SPACE]</i>

It's me. What's the matter?

186
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:55,170
Please sit down.

187
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:58,669
I'm Link Technology's general manager, Zhao Jiangyue.

188
00:09:58,670 --> 00:10:00,510
Why are you the one to talk about cooperation?

189
00:10:00,510 --> 00:10:02,319
Where's the hot guy I chatted with?

190
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:03,780
Hello.

191
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,660
The hot guy you chatted with is here.

192
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:09,519
- Coffee.
- Hello.

193
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:12,349
You look even better in person than in your photos.

194
00:10:12,350 --> 00:10:14,690
You're more beautiful in person than you are in the show.

195
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:22,900
The thing is that we would like to talk

196
00:10:22,900 --> 00:10:26,099
to Mr. Zhang Hao about cooperation but we can't reach him.

197
00:10:26,099 --> 00:10:27,859
We heard that you are close to him.

198
00:10:27,859 --> 00:10:29,540
I don't know him.

199
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,740
I'll be off if there's nothing else.

200
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,340
Excuse me.

201
00:10:33,340 --> 00:10:37,000
Are you the girl in this photo?

202
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,240
No.

203
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,290
But the birthmark on her leg is exactly the same as yours.

204
00:10:45,110 --> 00:10:46,639
So what exactly do you want?

205
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,240
Are you here to collect the debt?

206
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,209
I really have nothing to do with Zhang Hao.

207
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:54,029
He hired me to take this photo.

208
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:58,709
And the cheating story was all a hype by a gossip company he hired.

209
00:10:58,709 --> 00:11:00,170
What do you mean?

210
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:04,700
I mean, it's all fake. It was staged by Zhang Hao.

211
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,619
In order to prevent his wife from going into debt with him,

212
00:11:07,619 --> 00:11:12,079
he specially hired me to take those intimate photos

213
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:13,959
and make fake news.

214
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:16,519
So I'm really not familiar with Zhang Hao.

215
00:11:16,520 --> 00:11:19,709
If you want money, find someone else.

216
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:24,979
I'm already unlucky enough to get involved with a debtor.

217
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:34,700
We have all misunderstood Zhang Hao.

218
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:35,840
What are we waiting for?

219
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:38,020
Quickly call Qian Jingjing and tell her the truth.

220
00:11:38,020 --> 00:11:39,740
Right.

221
00:11:42,960 --> 00:11:45,879
<i>Hello, the number you have dialed is switched off.</i>

222
00:11:45,880 --> 00:11:47,520
It's switched off.

223
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:51,340
I'll call Zhang Hao. He should be able to find her.

224
00:12:04,740 --> 00:12:07,060
<i>[Zhao Jiangyue]</i>

225
00:12:09,030 --> 00:12:10,819
- Hello?
- Qian Jingjing has gone missing.

226
00:12:10,819 --> 00:12:11,879
Do you know where she is?

227
00:12:11,880 --> 00:12:13,140
When did it happen?

228
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:15,109
<i>Zhang Hao, are you out of your mind?</i>

229
00:12:15,110 --> 00:12:16,469
<i>You staged the whole thing.</i>

230
00:12:16,470 --> 00:12:18,079
<i>Who are you trying to impress?</i>

231
00:12:18,080 --> 00:12:19,660
What's the big deal about bankruptcy?

232
00:12:19,660 --> 00:12:22,589
Will Qian Jingjing leave you because you are bankrupt?

233
00:12:22,590 --> 00:12:23,879
Is she that kind of person?

234
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:26,959
No, listen to me. I have a lot of debt problems after the bankruptcy.

235
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:28,519
I can't get Jingjing into trouble.

236
00:12:28,520 --> 00:12:31,120
Drop the "I-am-being-responsible-for-her" crap in front of me.

237
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:32,760
You have no faith in her

238
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:34,540
<i>and your relationship.</i>

239
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:38,479
<i>The fake cheating and the divorce hurt her more than being bankrupt and in debt.</i>

240
00:12:38,479 --> 00:12:39,759
<i>I'll scold you later.</i>

241
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,029
Now, you must find Jingjing for me.

242
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:44,279
If anything happens to her, I will never let you go!

243
00:12:44,279 --> 00:12:46,640
<i>You have to tell me when it happened!</i>

244
00:12:49,550 --> 00:12:51,180
So assertive!

245
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:19,350
<i>I bought it and wrote your name on the property ownership certificate.</i>

246
00:13:19,350 --> 00:13:23,070
<i>I'm glad I only met you after I became successful.</i>

247
00:13:23,070 --> 00:13:29,459
<i>I want to be with you every year, every month, and every day from this moment onwards.</i>

248
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:59,519
<i>Jingjing, Zhang Hao has been lying to you.</i>

249
00:13:59,520 --> 00:14:00,759
<i>He didn't cheat.</i>

250
00:14:00,760 --> 00:14:03,449
<i>He's actually broke and doesn't want to get you involved.</i>

251
00:14:03,449 --> 00:14:05,229
<i>No one loves you more than he does.</i>

252
00:14:05,230 --> 00:14:07,199
<i>Where are you? Tell me quickly.</i>

253
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:09,330
<i>Don't make us worry.</i>

254
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:57,929
Sir, hurry up a little. Hurry up a little.

255
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,400
Okay.

256
00:15:26,110 --> 00:15:27,530
You're here?

257
00:15:27,530 --> 00:15:29,439
Great, I'll give Jiangyue a call.

258
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,900
No need.

259
00:15:30,900 --> 00:15:33,080
I've already told her.

260
00:15:34,790 --> 00:15:39,860
Have you been living here since our divorce?

261
00:15:40,610 --> 00:15:43,010
You brought those things here...

262
00:15:43,710 --> 00:15:46,250
that I threw away?

263
00:15:46,250 --> 00:15:52,040
I'm just reluctant to get rid of them because they hold a lot of memories.

264
00:15:52,040 --> 00:15:54,399
I've been cleaning up this place.

265
00:15:54,400 --> 00:15:59,360
You can move in these few days to get away from the trouble.

266
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:01,730
Don't read the comments on the internet either.

267
00:16:01,730 --> 00:16:04,550
I'll ask someone to remove the hot search in a few days.

268
00:16:05,760 --> 00:16:07,590
Get some rest first.

269
00:16:07,590 --> 00:16:09,440
Wait a minute.

270
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,880
I know it all already.

271
00:16:13,880 --> 00:16:16,050
Everything.

272
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:18,880
I know...

273
00:16:19,760 --> 00:16:23,890
you didn't divorce me because you didn't care about me,

274
00:16:24,420 --> 00:16:28,299
but because you didn't want me to get involved in the company's matters.

275
00:16:28,299 --> 00:16:30,290
I know you want to protect me.

276
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:33,000
But have you ever thought that maybe I want to be with you

277
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:36,430
through thick and thin more than anything else?

278
00:16:37,470 --> 00:16:39,500
I'm sorry, Jingjing.

279
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,670
It's okay.

280
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:46,799
Because this matter shows me that you didn't really stop loving me.

281
00:16:47,590 --> 00:16:50,180
It's already a great comfort to me.

282
00:16:57,010 --> 00:16:59,570
It's my fault for thinking that I was always right.

283
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:02,200
I thought this would protect you.

284
00:17:02,200 --> 00:17:04,260
Instead, I hurt you.

285
00:17:04,260 --> 00:17:06,710
I was too stupid myself.

286
00:17:08,520 --> 00:17:10,940
I teach others about love

287
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:16,210
but I almost lost the one who loves me the most.

288
00:17:16,950 --> 00:17:21,440
Actually, I am not the perfect goddess

289
00:17:21,440 --> 00:17:24,260
that everyone thinks I am at all.

290
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,800
Look at this.

291
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,330
This is a picture of me when I was in high school.

292
00:17:37,330 --> 00:17:38,610
How did you...?

293
00:17:38,610 --> 00:17:41,000
There was once a time that I was cleaning the bookshelf at home.

294
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,109
It fell out of your diary.

295
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:48,579
At that time, I thought this chubby girl was so cute, so I kept it.

296
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:50,970
Jingjing,

297
00:17:51,710 --> 00:17:54,150
none of us are perfect.

298
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:58,349
I used to be a poor kid who could only eat instant noodles for my three meals.

299
00:17:58,349 --> 00:18:00,770
But we have one similarity.

300
00:18:00,770 --> 00:18:04,280
We keep fighting for what we want.

301
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:06,580
So no matter which side you are,

302
00:18:06,580 --> 00:18:09,710
you are still the most beautiful and loveliest in my heart.

303
00:18:10,920 --> 00:18:15,800
So give me a chance to confess my love to you again today, okay?

304
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:22,120
Let me stand behind you again and protect you, okay?

305
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:23,920
Okay.

306
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:31,910
No matter what happens in the future, I will never leave you.

00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,060
♫ <i>Maybe I should learn to accept</i> ♫

320
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:30,720
♫ <i>That lovers don't always make it to the end</i> ♫

321
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,580
♫ <i>It's we who did wrong, not love</i> ♫

322
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:40,100
♫ <i>In the end, we found we still loved each other</i> ♫

323
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,140
It's all right at last.

324
00:19:48,140 --> 00:19:52,030
Jingjing is all right, but not the company.

325
00:19:52,030 --> 00:19:55,640
I'm afraid that Song Xue will take advantage of the situation.

326
00:19:55,640 --> 00:19:57,800
We'll do whatever we can.

327
00:20:03,610 --> 00:20:07,860
Oh, poor stomach, I'm sorry that you're in my body.

328
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:10,230
I'll treat you to a good meal.

329
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:14,460
Okay. Let's go!

330
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:26,910
Are you still alive?

331
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:30,600
Catch.

332
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:34,470
This is what you're buying me?

333
00:20:34,940 --> 00:20:37,739
- Give it back if you don't like it.
- Who says I don't like it?

334
00:20:38,310 --> 00:20:40,400
So picky.

335
00:20:47,780 --> 00:20:49,880
How long have you been hungry?

336
00:20:50,660 --> 00:20:52,530
Five days.

337
00:20:54,940 --> 00:20:57,649
A thought came to me after we met the influencer today.

338
00:20:57,649 --> 00:20:58,950
Me too.

339
00:20:58,950 --> 00:21:02,060
Did we have the same thought?

340
00:21:04,230 --> 00:21:05,650
You first.

341
00:21:05,650 --> 00:21:08,300
Zhang Hao was trying to protect his wife by pretending to cheat.

342
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,440
If we can do a good job in public relations,

343
00:21:10,440 --> 00:21:13,469
Qian Jingjing's reputation and appeal will be turned around.

344
00:21:13,469 --> 00:21:15,469
And it won't affect our app.

345
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:17,010
That makes the two of us.

346
00:21:17,010 --> 00:21:19,930
We can take advantage of the buzz to hype it up again

347
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:22,450
to take the popularity of our app to another level.

348
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:23,780
Best of both worlds.

349
00:21:23,780 --> 00:21:28,530
This way, there will be a lot of room for turning this matter around.

350
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,860
Are our hearts connected?

351
00:21:31,860 --> 00:21:33,229
What? Is one not enough?

352
00:21:33,230 --> 00:21:35,130
A handshake.

353
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:40,440
Give it back!

354
00:21:40,440 --> 00:21:43,330
I'm hungry!

355
00:22:21,880 --> 00:22:24,320
Mr. Xu, what brings you here?

356
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:25,940
I called you but you didn't answer.

357
00:22:25,940 --> 00:22:28,740
I was a bit worried so I came.

358
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:30,900
Sorry, I was too busy today.

359
00:22:30,900 --> 00:22:32,240
I didn't hear it.

360
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:34,700
Why don't you go to my home and rest for a while?

361
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,350
Okay.

362
00:22:52,810 --> 00:22:55,200
You go back first.

363
00:22:55,200 --> 00:22:57,110
Mr. Xu, please come in.

364
00:22:57,110 --> 00:22:58,230
Thanks a lot.

365
00:22:58,230 --> 00:22:59,860
I...

366
00:23:03,230 --> 00:23:05,230
Mr. Xu, have some water.

367
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:13,600
Actually, I came here today to talk to you about work.

368
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:15,730
Xu Ningyuan, the old fox,

369
00:23:15,730 --> 00:23:17,940
is always flirting with girls in the name of work.

370
00:23:17,940 --> 00:23:21,170
I heard that something happened in your company.

371
00:23:21,170 --> 00:23:23,660
You've been ostracized, right?

372
00:23:23,660 --> 00:23:25,480
Who needs your late advice?

373
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:28,080
I've already got a plan.

374
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:30,829
<i>Qian Jingjing's matter is easy to solve.</i>

375
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:33,159
Whether it's using money or public relations,

376
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,200
it can be solved quickly.

377
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,880
What matters is this Song Xue.

378
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:41,380
How long can you endure her with your personality?

379
00:23:42,210 --> 00:23:44,560
I'll find a way to solve it.

380
00:23:47,090 --> 00:23:50,260
I initially intended

381
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:53,059
to talk you out of this company's mess.

382
00:23:53,059 --> 00:23:54,919
I wanted you to come to my company.

383
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:58,070
I'll offer you a good salary and a good position.

384
00:23:58,070 --> 00:24:00,470
But I gave up on that idea...

385
00:24:01,780 --> 00:24:05,360
on the way here.

386
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,730
Why?

387
00:24:06,730 --> 00:24:09,080
Because I think...

388
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:13,230
what I can give you may not be what you want.

389
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:17,480
Otherwise, you wouldn't have rejected.

390
00:24:18,330 --> 00:24:20,580
Reject what?

391
00:24:20,580 --> 00:24:21,699
No, what...

392
00:24:21,699 --> 00:24:22,829
What does he mean?

393
00:24:22,830 --> 00:24:27,790
Maybe... that's why we can't be together.

394
00:24:27,790 --> 00:24:30,150
We always have different ideas.

395
00:24:30,150 --> 00:24:34,740
But I... still want to thank you.

396
00:24:34,740 --> 00:24:38,910
As a friend... and as a mentor.

397
00:24:42,560 --> 00:24:45,410
I'm actually curious about one thing.

398
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:52,410
Can Gu Jiaxin... really give you what you want?

399
00:25:02,060 --> 00:25:04,470
Actually, <i>he was the one who...</i>

400
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,500
<i>he was the one who—</i>

401
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:10,810
I missed the key information.

402
00:25:11,700 --> 00:25:14,260
It seems that someone is getting worried.

403
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:17,510
I'll be off then.

404
00:25:17,510 --> 00:25:19,530
Why is there no sound?

405
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:27,970
What are you doing?

406
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:29,010
Are you done talking?

407
00:25:29,010 --> 00:25:30,010
Are you all right?

408
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:31,800
I'm fine.

409
00:25:32,780 --> 00:25:34,919
I'll be off then. Call me if you need anything.

410
00:25:34,919 --> 00:25:37,680
Okay, take care.

411
00:25:37,680 --> 00:25:40,739
Mr. Xu, well... Safe trip home.

412
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:48,000
What did you talk about?

413
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:50,720
Why do you care?

414
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:53,500
Why didn't you invite me in for a hot cup of tea? I have something to talk to you about, too.

415
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:55,830
What is it?

416
00:25:55,830 --> 00:25:58,510
Work. It's about work.

417
00:25:58,510 --> 00:26:02,439
Fine. Just in time, you can draw up a follow-up plan.

418
00:26:05,180 --> 00:26:06,660
I...

419
00:26:09,700 --> 00:26:12,689
Others can have hot tea when they come, but I can only work?

420
00:26:12,689 --> 00:26:14,929
That's not how you should treat a diligent person, right?

421
00:26:14,929 --> 00:26:18,200
Come over. Get a chair.

422
00:26:30,730 --> 00:26:34,700
<i>Can Gu Jiaxin... really give you what you want?</i>

423
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:39,430
<i>Actually, he was the one who made me understand</i>

424
00:26:39,430 --> 00:26:41,630
<i>what I really wanted.</i>

425
00:26:42,610 --> 00:26:45,859
<i>Jiangyue, the girl that attended the wedding with me that day</i>

426
00:26:45,859 --> 00:26:47,700
<i>was not my girlfriend.</i>

427
00:26:47,700 --> 00:26:49,010
<i>It seems that both you and I</i>

428
00:26:49,010 --> 00:26:52,340
<i>can't find a better match than we are to each other.</i>

429
00:26:52,340 --> 00:26:54,320
<i>Let's be together.</i>

430
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:57,110
<i>Do you still like me?</i>

431
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:05,540
<i>[Stay safe]</i>

432
00:27:10,920 --> 00:27:12,590
<i>Jiangyue,</i>

433
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:15,960
<i>I wish you happiness.</i>

434
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:17,260
<i>[Stay safe]</i>

435
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:31,769
Would it be better if we leave out number one and two?

Looking forward to making a turn tomorrow.

458
00:28:44,160 --> 00:28:46,300
I'll tell Jingjing now.

459
00:28:55,760 --> 00:28:56,829
Hello? Jiangyue.

460
00:28:56,830 --> 00:28:59,650
<i>Hello, are you asleep?</i>

461
00:28:59,650 --> 00:29:01,800
I'm with Zhang Hao now.

462
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,109
Don't worry. I'm all right.

463
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:08,400
We have agreed that no matter what happens in the future,

464
00:29:08,400 --> 00:29:11,680
we will face it together and never hide anything.

465
00:29:12,470 --> 00:29:14,450
That's great!

466
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:18,760
Jiangyue, I'm sorry.

467
00:29:18,760 --> 00:29:21,159
<i>You've been supporting me in being the ambassador,</i>

468
00:29:21,160 --> 00:29:23,690
<i>but now things have become like this.</i>

469
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:25,840
<i>I've dragged you down.</i>

470
00:29:25,840 --> 00:29:27,230
I've been selling my relationship

471
00:29:27,230 --> 00:29:31,629
as a public persona to please others because of my vanity.

472
00:29:31,629 --> 00:29:34,130
And yet I've made a mess of my relationship.

473
00:29:34,130 --> 00:29:35,540
<i>Don't think that way.</i>

474
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:37,370
Now that things have already happened,

475
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:40,110
we can just think of a solution. Right?

476
00:29:49,060 --> 00:29:51,310
I've given it some thought.

477
00:29:51,310 --> 00:29:56,829
I really don't deserve to be the ambassador of Love Note anymore.

478
00:29:56,829 --> 00:29:59,460
<i>I have caused you so much trouble.</i>

479
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:03,990
<i>So I am willing to pay liquidated damages</i>

480
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:06,730
<i>and terminate the ambassador's contract in advance.</i>

481
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:12,300
I don't want to use my relationship to increase fame and build my public persona anymore.

482
00:30:14,370 --> 00:30:18,070
Okay. Since...

483
00:30:18,970 --> 00:30:23,330
you have made your decision, I will respect you.

484
00:30:23,330 --> 00:30:26,440
Thank you, Jiangyue.

485
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:28,509
Get some rest early. Bye.

486
00:30:28,509 --> 00:30:30,160
<i>Bye.</i>

487
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:37,060
What's wrong?

488
00:30:37,060 --> 00:30:40,020
We may have to scrap this proposal.

489
00:30:41,190 --> 00:30:44,550
Jingjing says she doesn't want to use her relationship to create hype anymore

490
00:30:44,550 --> 00:30:47,390
and wants to terminate the ambassador's contract.

491
00:30:47,390 --> 00:30:49,230
I agreed.

492
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:53,250
You gave up the proposal to protect Qian Jingjing.

493
00:30:53,250 --> 00:30:54,610
But have you ever thought

494
00:30:54,610 --> 00:30:58,140
that if Qian Jingjing knew how important this proposal was to you,

495
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,699
she might accept it?

496
00:30:59,699 --> 00:31:04,420
I know. If I had mentioned it, she would not have refused.

497
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:08,620
But I don't want her to swallow bitterness in order to accomplish my work.

498
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,800
What should we do then?

499
00:31:16,820 --> 00:31:19,490
I'll lend you my hug for another five minutes.

500
00:31:23,060 --> 00:31:26,899
Cut it out. I'm not that fragile.

501
00:31:26,899 --> 00:31:28,780
You should hurry back and go to bed.

502
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,229
- Okay.
- You've worked hard.

503
00:31:30,229 --> 00:31:32,120
It's nothing.

504
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:36,380
Rest early.

505
00:31:36,380 --> 00:31:38,640
- Good night.
- Good night.

506
00:31:53,850 --> 00:31:57,940
<i>[Link Technology]</i>
I've asked the PR and the Legal Department to draw up an official statement.

507
00:31:57,940 --> 00:32:00,970
It will be posted on online platforms at the same time.

508
00:32:00,970 --> 00:32:04,799
I will also contact a number of self-media to write relevant reports

509
00:32:04,799 --> 00:32:08,509
to clear up our relationship with our former ambassador Qian Jingjing.

510
00:32:08,509 --> 00:32:11,659
These are the candidates I've selected for the new ambassador.

511
00:32:11,659 --> 00:32:12,999
You can take a look.

512
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:18,059
The details will be discussed further after we've confirmed the proposal.

513
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:21,590
Jiangyue, what's your opinion?

514
00:32:21,590 --> 00:32:23,390
Is there any other proposal?

515
00:32:25,420 --> 00:32:27,710
I agree with Ms. Song.

516
00:32:31,010 --> 00:32:32,780
What's going on?

517
00:32:32,780 --> 00:32:36,009
If there is no other proposal, we will go with Ms. Song's proposal.

518
00:32:36,009 --> 00:32:38,579
Everyone shall cooperate. You're dismissed.

519
00:32:38,579 --> 00:32:41,059
He Mei, send the PR draft to the media.

520
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:42,279
Okay, Ms. Song.

521
00:32:42,280 --> 00:32:45,429
It seems that Ms. Zhao has figured out a lot in one night.

522
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:48,299
You have to think hard in the workplace.

523
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,249
Don't think that you can get things done easily just because you've found a backer.

524
00:32:52,249 --> 00:32:53,730
What do you mean?

525
00:32:53,730 --> 00:32:55,710
I don't mean anything.

526
00:32:55,710 --> 00:33:02,490
I just think that the position obtained through a relationship is not steady.

527
00:33:02,490 --> 00:33:03,799
As soon as I returned to the company,

528
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:07,979
I heard a lot of discussions about the scandal between Ms. Zhao and the Group's Crown Prince.

529
00:33:07,979 --> 00:33:10,710
I didn't believe it at first.

530
00:33:11,440 --> 00:33:14,470
I'm really impressed.

531
00:33:15,370 --> 00:33:17,110
Ms. Song.

532
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,630
I must clarify something in front of everyone today.

533
00:33:33,630 --> 00:33:37,929
Ms. Zhao became our general manager with her own ability.

534
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:42,090
If she really got the position by dating me as you said,

535
00:33:42,090 --> 00:33:44,810
then I'd be laughing out loud in my dreams.

536
00:33:45,370 --> 00:33:49,790
I admit that I do like Zhao Jiangyue.

537
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:52,949
But these are my one-sided feelings.

538
00:33:52,950 --> 00:33:55,260
She never gave me a response.

539
00:33:56,420 --> 00:34:01,189
I will never allow anyone to smear her and slander her in front of me.

540
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,099
<i>Recently, the famous relationship blogger Qian Jingjing's divorce scandal was exposed.</i>

541
00:34:40,099 --> 00:34:43,069
<i>Love Note, the dating app she endorsed, has also been affected.</i>

542
00:34:43,069 --> 00:34:45,189
<i>Love Note has issued an official statement</i>

543
00:34:45,190 --> 00:34:47,999
<i>to completely revoke Qian Jingjing's ambassador status.</i>

544
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,079
<i>Although the public opinion on the internet has eased,</i>

545
00:34:50,080 --> 00:34:52,559
<i>the app's popularity has still been greatly reduced.</i>

546
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:56,049
<i>Qian Jingjing has also quit social media and closed her personal account.</i>

547
00:34:56,049 --> 00:34:58,149
Ms. Jin, you wanted to see me?

548
00:34:58,149 --> 00:34:59,710
Come in.

549
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,800
Have a seat.

550
00:35:05,220 --> 00:35:07,509
I know there's been a lot going on in the company lately.

551
00:35:07,509 --> 00:35:11,870
You had some thoughts about me bringing back Song Xue.

552
00:35:11,870 --> 00:35:15,630
And you didn't mean for Qian Jingjing's incident to happen.

553
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,330
- But...
- But the consequences have already happened.

554
00:35:18,330 --> 00:35:20,060
I am willing to take responsibility.

555
00:35:20,060 --> 00:35:24,539
I know you will do your best to recover the company's losses.

556
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:28,650
I can see your ability and your hard work.

557
00:35:28,650 --> 00:35:31,300
There's something I'd like to discuss with you.

558
00:35:31,300 --> 00:35:36,529
Jiaxin confessed to you in front of everyone yesterday, right?

559
00:35:37,610 --> 00:35:40,200
I'm not against office romance.

560
00:35:40,200 --> 00:35:42,970
But after all, Jiaxin is my son.

561
00:35:42,970 --> 00:35:45,470
Don't make it too difficult for me.

562
00:35:46,120 --> 00:35:48,360
I understand what you mean.

563
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,050
So you don't have to tell me.

564
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,820
I'll leave.

565
00:35:53,820 --> 00:35:55,879
- You want to resign?
- Yes.

566
00:35:55,879 --> 00:35:59,290
You arranged for Jiaxin to work by my side.

567
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,880
I thought I would teach him,

568
00:36:01,880 --> 00:36:03,850
but I didn't expect...

569
00:36:03,850 --> 00:36:06,120
that I would learn so much from him.

570
00:36:06,120 --> 00:36:08,540
From the day I joined the company,

571
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:12,950
every decision I made was work-oriented.

572
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,770
I basically never considered myself.

573
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:21,820
But now, I want to stop for a moment

574
00:36:21,820 --> 00:36:23,950
and care more about myself.

575
00:36:23,950 --> 00:36:26,980
Do you really want to be with Jiaxin?

576
00:36:26,980 --> 00:36:31,109
Did it ever occur to you that he might just be impulsive?

577
00:36:31,109 --> 00:36:33,720
I don't want to deceive you.

578
00:36:33,720 --> 00:36:36,480
I admit that I like Jiaxin.

579
00:36:36,480 --> 00:36:41,360
I also know that it's a challenge for me to be with him.

580
00:36:41,360 --> 00:36:45,700
I haven't thought about what we would be like in the future.

581
00:36:45,700 --> 00:36:49,390
At least I don't want to do something I'll regret.

582
00:36:49,390 --> 00:36:52,880
So I want to give myself some time

583
00:36:52,880 --> 00:36:55,430
to think this through.

584
00:36:56,180 --> 00:36:59,540
Personally, as a mother,

585
00:36:59,540 --> 00:37:02,160
I'm not optimistic about your relationship.

586
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:05,680
At work, you are the most outstanding employee

587
00:37:05,680 --> 00:37:08,970
of Link Technology since its establishment.

588
00:37:08,970 --> 00:37:12,699
I can tell that the company has drained you out too much lately.

589
00:37:12,699 --> 00:37:13,939
How about this?

590
00:37:13,939 --> 00:37:15,989
I'll grant you an indefinite leave.

591
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:18,060
Get some good rest.

592
00:37:18,060 --> 00:37:20,320
We will talk later.

593
00:37:20,320 --> 00:37:21,419
Ms. Jin.

594
00:37:21,419 --> 00:37:23,420
Let's just do this.

595
00:37:30,770 --> 00:37:32,370
Okay.

596
00:37:58,980 --> 00:38:00,300
You're here?

597
00:38:00,300 --> 00:38:03,900
Look. I brought you back the cactus.

598
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:06,170
I even got it a new flowerpot

599
00:38:06,170 --> 00:38:09,030
to put on your new desk.

600
00:38:09,740 --> 00:38:11,000
Does it look good?

601
00:38:11,000 --> 00:38:13,200
It looks good.

602
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:15,430
But it's going to move.

603
00:38:15,430 --> 00:38:17,180
Where to?

604
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,080
I have resigned.

605
00:38:20,430 --> 00:38:22,020
What?

606
00:38:22,640 --> 00:38:24,840
You've resigned?

607
00:38:25,640 --> 00:38:27,440
From today onwards,

608
00:38:27,440 --> 00:38:29,590
you don't have to teach me about dating

609
00:38:29,590 --> 00:38:31,940
or work with me anymore.

610
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:34,360
Take care of yourself.

611
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:38,790
Zhao Jiangyue, are you angry with me

612
00:38:38,790 --> 00:38:40,400
because I confessed my love to you publicly?

613
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:43,160
Is that why you don't even want to stay in the company?

614
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:45,660
Do you just want to stay away from me?

615
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:49,950
You're not going to cry, are you?

616
00:38:51,270 --> 00:38:54,480
If you really leave, I will cry!

617
00:38:54,480 --> 00:38:55,839
Show me then.

618
00:38:55,839 --> 00:38:57,260
You...

619
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,190
Zhao Jiangyue, you've become bad.

620
00:38:59,190 --> 00:39:01,870
I'm teasing you.

621
00:39:02,520 --> 00:39:04,720
Your mother didn't approve of my resignation.

622
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:08,060
As of today, I'm on indefinite leave.

623
00:39:08,060 --> 00:39:11,829
I haven't given myself a holiday since I joined the company.

624
00:39:11,829 --> 00:39:13,259
I can use this chance to relax.

625
00:39:13,259 --> 00:39:16,269
When I'm gone, no one will be watching you.

626
00:39:16,269 --> 00:39:19,870
You have to work hard, office worker.

627
00:39:22,180 --> 00:39:23,659
Little Aunt, are you really leaving?

628
00:39:23,659 --> 00:39:26,129
Ms. Zhao, don't leave. We all support you.

629
00:39:26,130 --> 00:39:28,319
Ms. Zhao, please reconsider this.

630
00:39:28,319 --> 00:39:30,419
If you leave, we'll lose our mainstay.

631
00:39:30,419 --> 00:39:31,329
That's right.

632
00:39:31,329 --> 00:39:33,780
It's been a hard time for everyone.

633
00:39:33,780 --> 00:39:36,050
I want to thank all of you.

634
00:39:36,050 --> 00:39:39,480
We have achieved very good results through our efforts.

635
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:41,060
Don't give up!

636
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,760
I believe this project is still very promising.

637
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:45,469
You'll get a big bonus at the year's end.

638
00:39:45,469 --> 00:39:47,659
Ms. Zhao, you really can't leave.

639
00:39:47,659 --> 00:39:49,639
You can't be the only one to take the blame for this.

640
00:39:49,639 --> 00:39:50,459
That's right.

641
00:39:50,459 --> 00:39:54,119
Even if we got a big bonus, we wouldn't be happy.

642
00:39:54,119 --> 00:39:56,460
Who are we going to celebrate with?

643
00:39:58,840 --> 00:40:01,410
It just so happens that I can give myself a break,

644
00:40:01,410 --> 00:40:03,460
I'm also quite happy.

645

Jiangyue!

646
00:40:54,049 --> 00:40:56,280
Jiangyue, wait for me!

647
00:40:57,610 --> 00:40:58,610
What are you doing?

648
00:40:58,610 --> 00:41:00,270
I'm taking leave with you.

649
00:41:00,270 --> 00:41:01,730
As a qualified assistant,

650
00:41:01,730 --> 00:41:04,229
why should I stay when my boss has left the company?

651
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:06,200
Who approved of your leave?

652
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:08,300
That's not important.

653
00:41:08,300 --> 00:41:11,080
I'm on leave anyway.

654
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:14,600
It's great to not have to go to work!

655
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:18,250
Keep your voice down!

656
00:41:18,250 --> 00:41:20,130
No.

<i>[The Romeo and Juliet Effect]</i>

663
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:44,769
As you all know, my husband and I had some disagreements a while back.

664
00:41:44,769 --> 00:41:47,400
But now everything is back on track.

665
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:49,599
I can't help but express a few thoughts.

666
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:53,070
People always ask me why some couples

667
00:41:53,070 --> 00:41:55,519
are prone to quarrel on ordinary days,

668
00:41:55,520 --> 00:41:57,329
but once they encounter difficulties,

669
00:41:57,329 --> 00:42:01,419
they can form a closer relationship than before.

670
00:42:01,419 --> 00:42:05,389
Actually, this is the Romeo and Juliet effect.

671
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:07,190
I know this.

672
00:42:07,190 --> 00:42:08,980
What do you know?

673
00:42:08,980 --> 00:42:11,469
Romeo and Juliet's relationship

674
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:14,219
was greatly hindered by a family feud.

675
00:42:14,219 --> 00:42:17,039
But instead of breaking up,

676
00:42:17,040 --> 00:42:19,869
the difficulties made their love stronger until they died for love.

677
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:23,470
That's right. This is the Romeo and Juliet effect.

678
00:42:23,470 --> 00:42:24,999
When there are external forces

679
00:42:25,000 --> 00:42:27,949
that interfere with a relationship in real life,

680
00:42:27,950 --> 00:42:32,520
the relationship will become stronger instead.
