- Young Master is back.
- Ms. Wang.

24
00:01:37,773 --> 00:01:40,823
Mom, Kang Zhe's surgery went well.

25
00:01:40,823 --> 00:01:42,750
The doctor said there's hope for him to come round.

26
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:45,869
I know. The hospital has informed me.

27
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:57,190
For Kang Zhe's matter, thank you.

28
00:01:59,610 --> 00:02:02,520
When did you become so sensible?

29
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:04,260
Perhaps Ms. Zhao taught me well.

30
00:02:04,260 --> 00:02:07,979
That's quite effective. You've matured a little.

31
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:11,880
But you arranged for Yanran to come to the company, right?

32
00:02:11,880 --> 00:02:15,930
I just gave notice. She got in on her own merits.

33
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,840
Yanran is actually very nice to you.

- Mom.

Can you stop worrying about me?

37
00:02:26,469 --> 00:02:30,330
There's really no possibility between us. I have my own thoughts.

38
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:33,979
I'm only asking you to get along with her, not to marry her.

00:02:33,979 --> 00:02:35,860
Can't you take it as a brother taking care of his sister?

40
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,700
No.

41
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:43,009
All right, fine. I can take care of her but there's really no possibility between us.

I have to make this clear to you in advance.

Jiaxin, let's go to the movies.

54
00:03:27,550 --> 00:03:28,749
No, I have to work.

55
00:03:28,749 --> 00:03:30,950
Why do you have work to do again?

56
00:03:30,950 --> 00:03:34,549
Everyone has left. You are the only one working overtime.

57
00:03:35,310 --> 00:03:37,680
Look! Ms. Zhao has gotten off work, too!

58
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:40,390
Ms. Zhao.

59
00:03:43,190 --> 00:03:45,180
You can get off work.

60
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:49,750
Come on, let's go to the movies.

61
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:54,389
Why does my head feel a bit dizzy?

62
00:03:54,389 --> 00:03:56,110
It could be hypoglycemia!

63
00:03:56,110 --> 00:03:59,369
Let's go get something sweet to replenish your blood sugar. Let's go.

Stop, stop!

65
00:04:07,210 --> 00:04:09,270
See what you want to eat.

66
00:04:09,270 --> 00:04:11,130
You can order first.

67
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,740
Then I'll have a Snow with the Black Pearl, too.

68
00:04:16,740 --> 00:04:18,619
I remember you don't like it, do you?

69
00:04:18,619 --> 00:04:21,910
What you like is what I like.

70
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,220
By the way, what do you think of Ms. Zhao?

71
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,640
She's not bad.

72
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:33,400
She's cold on the outside, but

73
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,100
warm on the inside.

74
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,890
Then you and her...

75
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:41,770
Impossible. There's nothing between us.

76
00:04:41,770 --> 00:04:44,659
Take it easy. I didn't say you two had anything.

77
00:04:44,659 --> 00:04:46,540
It was during the last meeting,

78
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,440
I felt that Mr. Xu seemed to be interested in Ms. Zhao.

79
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:53,540
How can you tell?

80
00:04:53,540 --> 00:04:55,250
It's a woman's sixth sense.

81
00:04:55,250 --> 00:04:56,830
Then tell me,

82
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,170
does Zhao Jiangyue have feelings for Xu Ningyuan?

83
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:05,490
I feel it's rather vague and not very obvious.

84
00:05:07,550 --> 00:05:10,250
But I think you are quite strange.

85
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:12,790
Do you have a crush on someone?

86
00:05:13,620 --> 00:05:15,540
No.

87
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:20,309
That's good. Then I feel that I'm very, very close to becoming your girlfriend.

88
00:05:20,309 --> 00:05:22,970
- I feel that your feeling is not so accurate.
- Excuse me.

89
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:24,590
Just you wait!

90
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:27,000
Here, yours.

91
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:30,800
Eat more, you've just had low blood sugar.

92
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,369
Is it good? Eat more.

93
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:38,440
Eat.

94
00:05:40,810 --> 00:05:42,590
Eat more.

95

<i>[Episode 8]
[More than friends, less than lovers]</i>

96
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:55,690
- Ms. Zhao.
- Come in.

97
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,660
There's a problem.

98
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:59,549
The advertising firm we've worked with for three years

99
00:05:59,549 --> 00:06:02,180
doesn't seem to be willing to renew the contract.

100
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:03,400
What happened?

101
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:05,180
This project was previously signed by Ms. Song.

102
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:08,180
Now that Ms. Song is gone, they may be wavering.

103
00:06:08,180 --> 00:06:10,500
Plus, the competing companies have strong momentum.

104
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,420
They may work with others at any time.

105
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,890
Okay, I got it.

106
00:06:15,890 --> 00:06:18,970
Earlier, I contacted Ms. Song.

107
00:06:19,650 --> 00:06:21,910
She said she had left the job

108
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:25,190
and told me to report everything to you in the future.

109
00:06:26,710 --> 00:06:29,219
Don't bother Ms. Song. We'll solve it ourselves.

110
00:06:29,219 --> 00:06:30,870
Have you contacted Mr. Wang?

111
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:33,060
I tried, but I couldn't reach him in person.

112
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,710
I remember Mr. Wang likes to play golf.

113
00:06:35,710 --> 00:06:37,060
Let's go to the golf course this week.

114
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:39,110
But there's a membership system.

115
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:42,279
It costs millions. How do we get in?

116
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:45,980
There should be someone who can help us.

117
00:06:45,980 --> 00:06:48,779
- You go to work first, I'll sort it out.
- Okay.

118
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:51,890
Zihao, what happened?

119
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:54,430
The advertising firm we worked with suddenly can't be contacted

120
00:06:54,430 --> 00:06:56,270
and no solution can be found.

121
00:06:56,270 --> 00:06:58,930
Ms. Zhao is quite worried.

122
00:07:01,850 --> 00:07:04,150
Mr. Xu,

123
00:07:04,200 --> 00:07:10,800
I have to go to the Golden Golf Club this weekend to meet a client, but it has a closed membership system.

124
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:12,100
<i>I remember that you're a...</i>

125
00:07:12,110 --> 00:07:14,960
I got it. I'm going tomorrow, too.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:18,300
<i>To play golf. I've not been exercising.</i>

127
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:21,779
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

128
00:07:21,779 --> 00:07:24,160
This is the first time you've asked me for help.

129
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:26,290
<i>I'm quite happy.</i>

130
00:07:26,290 --> 00:07:28,650
Okay, that's it then.

131
00:07:28,650 --> 00:07:30,420
Bye.

132
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:44,970
Come in.

133
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:47,100
Do you need my help?

134
00:07:48,220 --> 00:07:51,359
I see that you're so worried. What's wrong?

135
00:07:51,359 --> 00:07:52,780
I can help you.

136
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:55,490
- Can you play golf?
- Golf?

137
00:07:55,490 --> 00:07:57,060
Yes.

138
00:07:57,069 --> 00:07:58,939
- Are you good at it?
- Not bad.

139
00:07:58,939 --> 00:08:01,030
I've played for over 10 years.

140
00:08:01,030 --> 00:08:04,430
Okay. Then you teach me how to play golf.

141
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,359
As quick as possible. Preferably let me know how to play by this weekend.

142
00:08:09,359 --> 00:08:11,150
No way, impossible.

143
00:08:11,150 --> 00:08:14,019
How can that be impossible? You can't do it?

144
00:08:14,019 --> 00:08:15,710
Let's give it a go, then.

145
00:08:15,710 --> 00:08:17,650
As long as the student is not stupid,

146
00:08:17,650 --> 00:08:22,520
a teacher of my level should be more than adequate.

147
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:24,490
That's enough, stop bragging about it.

148
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:26,899
- It's a deal then.
- Okay.

149
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,550
I did you a favor,

150
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:30,460
you should do me a favor, too.

151
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:32,210
Are you bargaining with me?

152
00:08:32,210 --> 00:08:34,140
I just want to borrow your car.

153
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:36,939
My girlfriend, Alice, is back from the USA. I have to pick her up.

154
00:08:36,939 --> 00:08:39,540
When did you get a girlfriend?

155
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:41,780
I'm not lending.

156
00:08:41,780 --> 00:08:43,740
You're jealous?

157
00:08:44,470 --> 00:08:46,700
Why are you so sour?

158
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,889
Just take a taxi. I have work to do tonight.

159
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,420
You have work tonight?

160
00:08:52,420 --> 00:08:54,690
Have you forgotten that I'm your assistant?

161
00:08:54,690 --> 00:08:57,090
I know if you have work tonight or not.

162
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:59,640
Besides, it's expensive to take a taxi.

163
00:08:59,640 --> 00:09:01,980
I am now a mere employee of the company.

164
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:04,910
I have to save every penny I have.

165
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:13,250
Take it, just take it.

166
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:19,600
- Why are you still here?
- I want you to come with me.

167
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:23,519
You don't have anything to do at home anyway, might as well see the beauty with me.

168
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,819
I'll teach you to play golf after picking up my girlfriend.

169
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:30,540
Let's go then, do you think I don't dare to?

170
00:09:30,540 --> 00:09:33,760
No matter what, you must teach me.

171
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,590
No problem.

172
00:09:42,150 --> 00:09:45,130
He even took my apple!

173
00:09:49,910 --> 00:09:52,889
One moment it's Alice, the next it's Li Yanran.

174
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:55,799
You have so many girlfriends. Does your mom know?

175
00:09:55,799 --> 00:09:58,370
I have nothing to do with Li Yanran.

176
00:09:58,370 --> 00:10:01,539
Don't put us together. People will misunderstand.

177
00:10:01,539 --> 00:10:02,850
You're right.

178
00:10:02,850 --> 00:10:06,040
You've got a girlfriend now.

179
00:10:06,040 --> 00:10:07,830
It doesn't matter.

180
00:10:07,830 --> 00:10:12,200
My girlfriend is never jealous as long as I'm happy.

181
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,050
<i>[Shanghai Junlian Racing Team]</i>

182
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,619
Aren't we going to the airport? Why are we here?

183
00:10:46,470 --> 00:10:49,650
How is it? Isn't it beautiful?

184
00:10:49,650 --> 00:10:53,490
Let me introduce to you, this is my girlfriend,

185
00:10:53,490 --> 00:10:55,230
Alice.

186
00:10:56,130 --> 00:10:57,810
You don't know.

187
00:10:57,810 --> 00:11:03,030
For men, every beloved vehicle is a special lover.

188
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,630
I'll count on you for this year's race.

189
00:11:23,630 --> 00:11:25,590
My Alice,

190
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,490
you must not fail me.

191
00:11:31,330 --> 00:11:34,010
Is this race so important?

192
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,500
Yes.

193
00:11:39,700 --> 00:11:41,500
I promised someone...

194
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:44,600
so I have to win the championship.

195
00:11:44,600 --> 00:11:48,800
You have to win the championship for one person?

196
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,300
- You're so childish.
- You don't get it.

197
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:53,700
This is a man's promise.

198
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,700
He is my best brother, Kang Zhe.

199
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,600
A year ago,

200
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,700
he had a very serious accident during a race...

201
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:11,600
and is still in a coma.

202
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
I promised my mom I'd come back...

203
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,600
in exchange for finding the best doctor for him.

204
00:12:26,400 --> 00:12:29,800
You came back to the company because of your friend?

205
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:31,800
Actually, many people have a misconception

206
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,500
that riding a motorbike is just to be cool.

207
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:38,600
In fact, it requires brainpower and physical strength.

208
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:41,300
I used to ride it with Kang Zhe for fun,

209
00:12:41,300 --> 00:12:43,000
thinking it was new.

210
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:44,600
But then I realized...

211
00:12:45,600 --> 00:12:47,800
it wasn't something that could be done well

212
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:49,800
through a moment of courage.

213
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:51,600
How so?

214
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,400
It's similar to your job.

215
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:56,300
You never know what the outcome will be

216
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:58,400
until you reach the finish line.

217
00:13:00,100 --> 00:13:01,200
<i>Come on.</i>

218
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:04,400
You must make adequate preparations

219
00:13:04,400 --> 00:13:07,000
and carry them out carefully.

220
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:14,200
Only by doing everything well and correctly

221
00:13:14,200 --> 00:13:16,200
can you finally win.

222
00:13:18,700 --> 00:13:20,800
- But sometimes,
<i> - Kangzhe!</i>

223
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,500
- even when you do everything right,
<i>-Kang Zhe!</i>

224
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:27,900
there are still all kinds of unpredictable situations.

225
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:38,500
But no matter what the outcome is,

226
00:13:39,900 --> 00:13:42,000
we must do our best during the process.

227
00:13:43,100 --> 00:13:44,800
I can understand.

228
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:47,200
The feeling of going all out

229
00:13:47,200 --> 00:13:49,800
every time you take on a new challenge

230
00:13:49,800 --> 00:13:52,200
is really good.

231
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,000
It's also because of you

232
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,800
that I have a new outlook on motorbikes.

233
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:05,400
It's not easy for someone to find something he's passionate about.

234
00:14:05,400 --> 00:14:10,000
But motorbike racing is too dangerous.

235
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,100
You must pay attention to safety.

236
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:17,200
Fine.

237
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:19,600
You helped me.

238
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,600
Now it's my turn to help you.

239
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:29,800
The right stance is the start of a perfect shot.

240
00:14:29,800 --> 00:14:32,900
First, we have to stand with our feet open,

241
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:34,800
a little wider than our shoulders,

242
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:36,600
and then bend our knees.

243
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,600
Lean our upper body towards the ball

244
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,300
and place our weight on our left foot.

245
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:42,400
Then, for the grip,

246
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:46,100
the "V" of the left hand points to the back of the chin.

247
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:48,400
Lift the club horizontally.

248
00:14:48,400 --> 00:14:50,000
Keep your head still.

249
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,500
Correct.

250
00:14:52,700 --> 00:14:54,800
Tilt the club, then go down.

251
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,700
Hit the ball horizontally.

252
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:57,900
Lift the club.

253
00:14:57,900 --> 00:14:59,500
Eyes to the front.

254
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,000
Backswing.

255
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:02,800
Try it.

256
00:15:02,800 --> 00:15:04,400
Okay.

257
00:15:05,500 --> 00:15:06,800
Your knees.

258
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:09,200
Straighten your left arm.

259
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:11,700
Hit. Lift the club.

260
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,400
Keep it vertical.

261
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:16,900
Here I go.

262
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:24,200
Then this way.

263
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,700

283
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:44,700
Not bad. You're good at sports.

284
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:47,000
You're doing well without practicing much.

285
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,700
You taught me well.

286
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:50,200
I know.

287
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:53,500
Thanks for your encouragement, Boss.

288
00:16:53,500 --> 00:16:56,100
I'm not your boss after work.

289
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:59,900
Indeed, you're cuter when you're not a boss.

290
00:16:59,900 --> 00:17:03,200
I don't think it's appropriate to describe me as cute.

291
00:17:03,200 --> 00:17:05,400
What's wrong with being cute?

292
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:08,800
"Cute" is a man's highest compliment to a woman.

293
00:17:08,800 --> 00:17:10,200
Really.

294
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:12,200
All right, thank you for today.

295
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:13,900
Go home and get some rest.

296
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:16,600
Thanks for picking Alice up with me.

297
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,200
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.

298
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,600
Where are you meeting your client?

299
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,400
Indoors or outdoors?

300
00:17:53,400 --> 00:17:54,700
I think it's outdoors.

301
00:17:54,700 --> 00:17:56,100
You think?

302
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:59,800
Did you fail to make an appointment?

303
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:02,000
A sudden problem came up at work.

304
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,800
Do you need help?

305
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:07,800
Let's play a few shots first.

306
00:18:07,800 --> 00:18:10,500
- You'll have to play when you talk later anyway.
- Okay.

307
00:18:10,500 --> 00:18:12,400
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

308
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:15,400
Shoulder-width apart, bend your knees.

309
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:18,300
Bring your legs a little closer.

310
00:18:18,300 --> 00:18:19,700
Continue.

311
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:25,500
The position of your hand.

312
00:18:27,300 --> 00:18:28,600
Okay.

313
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:30,300
Relax a bit.

314
00:18:30,300 --> 00:18:32,800
Come on, try a shot.

315
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,300
<i>Shoulder-width apart, okay.</i>

316
00:18:35,300 --> 00:18:36,800
<i>Knees slightly bent.</i>

317
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:40,000
<i>The "V" of the left hand points to the back of the chin.</i>

318
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:41,800
<i>Lift the club, head still.</i>

319
00:18:41,800 --> 00:18:43,800
<i>Touch the inside of the left knee.</i>

320
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:45,500
<i>Wrap your right hand.</i>

321
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:46,800
<i>Put the weight on the left foot.</i>

322
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,100
<i>Keep your eyes on the ball.</i>

323
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,000
<i>Hit the ball with the surface of the club horizontally.</i>

324
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:05,000
You've practiced before?

325
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:06,900
It's talent.

326
00:19:16,600 --> 00:19:18,400
Let's go, Jiaxin.

327
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:20,300
Yanran, I've something urgent.

328
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:23,700
But we agreed to go on a weekend date for a whole day.

329
00:19:23,700 --> 00:19:25,600
It's work. I can't hold it up.

330
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,400
Then, where are you going?

331
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:28,800
I'll go with you.

332
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,900
I promise I won't disturb you while you work.

333
00:19:31,900 --> 00:19:33,700
How about this?

334
00:19:33,700 --> 00:19:35,800
- We'll go next time.
- No way.

335
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,800
I don't care. I won't let you go if you don't take me there.

336
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:44,000
Let's go. I'm really in a hurry.

337
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:49,900
Mr. Wang, we are very sincere.

338
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,500
I've brought the contract, why don't you look at it first?

339
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,800
We used to work with Ms. Song. You've just taken up your post.

340
00:19:56,800 --> 00:20:00,700
I can accept that you and Ms. Song work in different ways.

341
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,300
But reducing our advertising space in order to get new clients,

342
00:20:05,300 --> 00:20:07,500
is a bit too...

343
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:11,800
Our cooperation is carried out according to the contract.

344
00:20:11,800 --> 00:20:14,400
The renewal of the contract is also intended to ensure

345
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:16,600
that your interests are maximized.

346
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:20,800
- We can discuss the details further.
- Ms. Zhao, it's the weekend.

347
00:20:20,800 --> 00:20:24,000
It's not a good time to talk about work.

348
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,100
Do you usually like to play golf?

349
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,800
I don't play it often.

350
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:32,100
I like it a lot. Because the biggest challenge in this sport

351
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:34,800
is not others but yourself.

352
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:38,600
You must be calm at all times

353
00:20:38,600 --> 00:20:40,500
and not be impatient.

354
00:20:53,100 --> 00:20:54,600
Please just pull over in front.

355
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,600
- Okay.
- Thank you.

356
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,000
Sir!

357
00:21:01,800 --> 00:21:04,600
I didn't expect to see you here.

358
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:06,400
You wear sportswear, too?

359
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,800
I thought you only had suits.

360
00:21:08,800 --> 00:21:10,800
You're here to play golf, too?

361
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,100
No, no.

362
00:21:12,100 --> 00:21:14,600
I'm here to wait for my boyfriend.

363
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,500
He's in there talking to a client.

364
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:20,200
So I'll just have to wait here for him.

365
00:21:20,200 --> 00:21:22,100
Gu Jiaxin.

366
00:21:22,100 --> 00:21:23,700
Did you manage to woo him?

367
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:27,900
It's only a matter of time before he's mine.

368
00:21:28,800 --> 00:21:30,000
You're laughing?

369
00:21:30,000 --> 00:21:32,000
How are you and Ms. Zhao doing?

370
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,200
Pretty good.

371
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:34,800
She's in there talking about work.

372
00:21:34,800 --> 00:21:36,800
Mr. Wang, it's like this.

373
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:38,000
We...

374
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:41,800
Ms. Zhao, I think you look charming in sportswear, too.

375
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:44,100
How about this? You play a shot, too?

376
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:45,200
No, I can't.

377
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,400
My skills are average.

378
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,300
- I'm not...
- It's all right.

379
00:21:47,300 --> 00:21:50,100
Here, come on.

380
00:21:50,100 --> 00:21:52,500
I'll give it a try then.

381
00:22:17,000 --> 00:22:18,400
Not bad, not bad.

382
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:21,600
Why don't we enjoy ourselves to the fullest and finish this game?

383
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:23,700
No. I'm not good.

384
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,500
I think you are very talented.

385
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:26,400
Try it again.

386
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:28,000
No, no.

387
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:29,200
Ms. Zhao.

388
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:32,700
I'll play this shot for you.

389
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:38,200
You are...?

390
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:39,800
Hello, Mr. Wang.

391
00:22:39,800 --> 00:22:42,400
I'm Gu Jiaxin, Ms. Zhao's assistant.

392
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,000
All right, you do it.

393
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:46,800
But do you know how to play?

394
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,000
I just returned to China

395
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:50,600
so I'm not familiar with the venue.

396
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:53,700
My friend, Liang Yue, is a small shareholder here so I came a few times before.

397
00:22:53,700 --> 00:22:57,900
You mean our company's independent director, Mr. Liang?

398
00:22:58,715 --> 00:23:00,525
We are childhood friends.

399
00:23:00,525 --> 00:23:03,764
I heard that there is cooperation between our companies,

400
00:23:03,764 --> 00:23:08,515
so I wanted to know you through Liang Yue.

401
00:23:08,515 --> 00:23:13,985
Ms. Zhao, there are hidden talents among your subordinates.

402
00:23:13,995 --> 00:23:16,255
Jiaxin just came back.

403
00:23:16,255 --> 00:23:20,404
Ms. Jin wants her son to be successful, so she put him by my side to train him.

404
00:23:20,404 --> 00:23:23,485
So you're Ms. Jin's beloved son.

405
00:23:23,485 --> 00:23:24,745
You flatter me.

406
00:23:24,745 --> 00:23:27,775
I'm not as good as Mr. Liang. He is already a president.

407
00:23:27,775 --> 00:23:29,355
I'm still an assistant.

408
00:23:29,355 --> 00:23:34,625
I can't even help with the small matter of renewing the company's contract with Mr. Wang.

409
00:23:34,625 --> 00:23:38,985
I guess my friends will be laughing at me.

410
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:43,025
Link Technology has been our strategic partner for many years.

411
00:23:43,025 --> 00:23:44,384
Contract renewal is a certainty.

412
00:23:44,384 --> 00:23:47,864
It's just that previously we'd been in contact with Ms. Song.

413
00:23:47,864 --> 00:23:50,605
We're not familiar with Ms. Zhao.

414
00:23:50,605 --> 00:23:54,054
Ms. Zhao is now the youngest general manager in our entire company.

415
00:23:54,054 --> 00:23:57,355
My mother also wants me to learn from Ms. Zhao.

416
00:23:57,355 --> 00:24:00,804
Ms. Zhao has the contract all ready. She's so sincere.

417
00:24:00,804 --> 00:24:03,405
I have to accept it.

418
00:24:03,405 --> 00:24:06,255
That's great! Mr. Wang, it's a pleasure.

419
00:24:06,255 --> 00:24:08,365
Likewise.

420
00:24:13,195 --> 00:24:16,014
Mr. Wang, I'll finish the game with you.

421
00:24:16,014 --> 00:24:17,795
All right.

422
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:29,974
I think the two of them are talking about the same thing inside.

423
00:24:32,275 --> 00:24:36,215
I'm here to play golf and take a break.

424
00:24:36,215 --> 00:24:37,674
You don't have to feel embarrassed.

425
00:24:37,674 --> 00:24:40,494
Good love is worth the wait.

426
00:24:40,494 --> 00:24:44,715
Jiangyue and I are not exactly waiting for each other.

427
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:48,235
I think you're a bit blindly confident.

428
00:24:51,795 --> 00:24:54,735
Why don't we add each other on WeChat?

429
00:24:54,735 --> 00:24:57,945
You see, you and Ms. Zhao are not in the same company.

430
00:24:57,945 --> 00:25:02,275
It's not easy for you to care for her and look after her.

431
00:25:02,275 --> 00:25:04,485
But if we both add each other's WeChat,

432
00:25:04,485 --> 00:25:08,335
I'll be your operator to tell you the real-time situation of Ms. Zhao

433
00:25:08,335 --> 00:25:10,265
and the latest information.

434
00:25:10,265 --> 00:25:12,095
How's that?

435
00:25:15,155 --> 00:25:17,385
I'm devoted to Jiaxin.

436
00:25:17,385 --> 00:25:20,545
You mustn't think I've got any designs on you.

437
00:25:22,925 --> 00:25:25,555
Come on, let's add each other.

438
00:25:25,555 --> 00:25:27,355
Add me.

439
00:25:31,685 --> 00:25:33,545
Nice working with you.

440
00:25:47,105 --> 00:25:50,335
How did you know I was here with the client?

441
00:25:50,335 --> 00:25:53,914
I'm your assistant. How can I not know where my boss is?

442
00:26:01,175 --> 00:26:02,575
Does it hurt?

443
00:26:02,575 --> 00:26:05,525
It's okay. It'll be fine tomorrow.

444
00:26:08,325 --> 00:26:10,825
Well done today.

445
00:26:15,115 --> 00:26:19,615
It takes a long time to really know how to play golf.

446
00:26:19,615 --> 00:26:22,035
Your hand is injured.

447
00:26:22,035 --> 00:26:23,825
Does it still hurt?

448
00:26:24,385 --> 00:26:26,855
In the future, if you really can't do it,

449
00:26:26,855 --> 00:26:29,075
you should learn to say no.

450
00:26:31,345 --> 00:26:33,825
The app will be available soon.

451
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:38,084
If a contract goes wrong now, everyone's effort will be wasted.

452
00:26:39,035 --> 00:26:42,275
The company is like a delicate machine.

453
00:26:42,275 --> 00:26:46,300
Everyone is in it for the betterment of the whole

454
00:26:46,300 --> 00:26:48,910
and not for their own comfort.

I'm so bored!

Sir, shall I help you test your love fortune?

471
00:28:06,345 --> 00:28:08,805
You know everything.

472

475
00:28:18,404 --> 00:28:19,725
I'll teach you.

476
00:28:19,725 --> 00:28:21,935
Close your eyes.

477
00:28:21,935 --> 00:28:23,775
Close!

478
00:28:23,775 --> 00:28:25,515
Just say it.

479
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:28,754
Then in your heart, say the name of your beloved person.

480
00:28:28,754 --> 00:28:32,464
And then choose one card with your utmost sincerity.

481
00:28:34,805 --> 00:28:36,665
This one.

482
00:28:43,235 --> 00:28:49,835
Sir, this tarot card says that you are likely to end up alone.

So?

00:28:52,525 --> 00:28:54,354
But it doesn't matter, Sir.

485
00:28:54,354 --> 00:28:59,064
It also says that if you can find your best partner and form an alliance,

486
00:28:59,064 --> 00:29:03,094
you can overcome the difficulties and find true love.

487
00:29:03,094 --> 00:29:07,585
How's that? Would you like to consider forming an alliance with me?

488
00:29:07,585 --> 00:29:09,324
I'm a very reliable person.

489
00:29:09,324 --> 00:29:13,534
I'll be your partner in pursuing love and we'll help each other out. How's that?

490
00:29:13,534 --> 00:29:17,555
You mean you want me to help you distract Zhao Jiangyue

491
00:29:17,555 --> 00:29:22,714
so that you can pursue Gu Jiaxin without any worries. Right?

492
00:29:24,935 --> 00:29:27,185
You...

493
00:29:27,185 --> 00:29:28,774
Stop thinking that way.

494
00:29:28,774 --> 00:29:30,725
This is mutually beneficial for both of us.

495
00:29:30,725 --> 00:29:34,095
You can't think that I'm using you.

496
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,465
I know clearly what Jiangyue thinks.

497
00:29:41,465 --> 00:29:43,425
I can only wish you good luck.

498
00:29:43,425 --> 00:29:48,515
And don't hit me so hard.

499
00:29:50,175 --> 00:29:52,665
I didn't use much strength.

500
00:29:57,685 --> 00:29:59,855
Let's go home together later.

501
00:30:00,825 --> 00:30:03,605
- Me and Xu Ningyuan...
- Jiaxin!

502
00:30:03,605 --> 00:30:05,425
Ms. Zhao.

503
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,154
Jiaxin, where are we going to play later?

504
00:30:13,154 --> 00:30:14,645
Yanran, stop it.

505
00:30:14,645 --> 00:30:16,655
How was it? Did it go well?

506
00:30:16,655 --> 00:30:20,015
Jiaxin came to help me, and it was all settled.

507
00:30:20,015 --> 00:30:23,285
You've worked hard. Join us for a meal.

508
00:30:24,005 --> 00:30:27,285
It's fine. I won't bother you anymore.

509
00:30:27,285 --> 00:30:29,375
Yanran is looking for me.

510
00:30:30,015 --> 00:30:32,625
Okay. Then we'll go first.

511
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:35,685
- Bye!
- Bye.

512
00:30:45,275 --> 00:30:48,845
Jiaxin, let's play Escape Room later.

513
00:30:51,535 --> 00:30:53,605
I'm tired. I'll go home.

514
00:30:54,155 --> 00:30:55,725
I'll send you home.

515
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:58,605
No need.

516
00:31:08,485 --> 00:31:10,674
What happened? You look so gloomy.

517
00:31:10,674 --> 00:31:15,374
You should report to me on your experience of spending time with Xu Ningyuan on the golf course.

518
00:31:15,374 --> 00:31:17,855
There's not much of an experience.

519
00:31:17,855 --> 00:31:21,455
All I can remember is talking to him about work.

520
00:31:21,455 --> 00:31:25,265
Are you kidding? Do you really treat love as your work?

521
00:31:25,265 --> 00:31:27,185
I don't know what happened either.

522
00:31:27,185 --> 00:31:28,974
I'm not sure what's wrong.

523
00:31:28,975 --> 00:31:30,135
What's wrong?

524
00:31:30,135 --> 00:31:31,985
You're right.

525
00:31:31,985 --> 00:31:36,004
Theoretically, he is indeed the best boyfriend candidate.

526
00:31:36,004 --> 00:31:37,995
But when we're together,

527
00:31:37,995 --> 00:31:40,994
we always have to try so hard to find something to talk about

528
00:31:40,994 --> 00:31:43,925
and it's like every word we say is from a script.

529
00:31:43,925 --> 00:31:46,395
I think he feels the same way, too.

530
00:31:46,395 --> 00:31:49,894
But as soon as we talk about work, we can talk normally,

531
00:31:49,894 --> 00:31:52,595
and we can talk a lot and be very engrossed.

532
00:31:52,595 --> 00:31:56,864
Perhaps, you guys started out with a superior-subordinate relationship.

533
00:31:56,864 --> 00:32:00,024
This is not a good start. You need to turn it around.

534
00:32:00,024 --> 00:32:01,925
I don't think that's the reason.

535
00:32:01,925 --> 00:32:04,204
Gu Jiaxin and I are also a subordinate and a superior.

536
00:32:04,204 --> 00:32:06,615
The atmosphere between us is quite relaxed.

537
00:32:06,615 --> 00:32:10,115
And we don't feel awkward even when we don't talk.

538
00:32:10,115 --> 00:32:14,254
You're not really in love with Gu Jiaxin without realizing it, are you?

539
00:32:14,254 --> 00:32:18,195
I'm just giving an example. When did I say I fell in love with him?

540
00:32:18,195 --> 00:32:21,475
Besides, I know very well that impulsiveness

541
00:32:21,475 --> 00:32:24,505
does not equal love.

542
00:32:24,505 --> 00:32:27,475
You're admitting that you had a moment of impulsiveness?

543
00:32:27,475 --> 00:32:31,174
No. I'm just casually saying.

544
00:32:31,174 --> 00:32:33,734
Actually, it's not impossible for you and Gu Jiaxin.

545
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:37,465
I'm just worried that your age difference might cause problems.

546
00:32:37,465 --> 00:32:41,675
He is now at an age of self-centeredness.

547
00:32:41,675 --> 00:32:44,305
This is how you get along now,

548
00:32:44,305 --> 00:32:47,195
but it may change a lot in the future.

549
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:51,565
If you are not worried about these outcomes, it's all right to try.

550
00:32:51,565 --> 00:32:53,185
I care about the outcome.

551
00:32:53,185 --> 00:32:56,075
I only care about the outcome now.

552
00:32:56,585 --> 00:32:58,335
Forget it. Let's change the topic.

553
00:32:58,335 --> 00:33:00,035
Tell me about your plans.

554
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:04,914
Now that Zhang Hao is a thing of the past, are you going to start over?

555
00:33:05,925 --> 00:33:09,295
I couldn't sleep in the past few nights

556
00:33:09,295 --> 00:33:13,155
and I've thought about Zhang Hao's matter carefully.

557
00:33:13,155 --> 00:33:16,544
It's true that even a wise man will make a mistake.

558
00:33:16,545 --> 00:33:20,575
I still can't figure out how I fell into his trap.

559
00:33:20,575 --> 00:33:22,825
But I came to understand one thing.

560
00:33:22,825 --> 00:33:26,375
That is, I can't be dumped by him for nothing.

561
00:33:26,375 --> 00:33:27,785
What do you want to do?

562
00:33:27,785 --> 00:33:32,484
The way to make a scumbag ex regret is to make him fall for you again,

563
00:33:32,484 --> 00:33:36,895
and then do the same thing to him

564
00:33:36,895 --> 00:33:41,175
by making him feel the pain of being dumped.

565
00:34:18,155 --> 00:34:20,735
How dare he block me?

566
00:34:20,735 --> 00:34:22,985
This scumbag.

567
00:34:27,860 --> 00:34:33,265
<i>[Meng Xixi's Weibo page]</i>

568
00:34:33,265 --> 00:34:35,305
As expected,

569
00:34:35,305 --> 00:34:39,655
the cheaters are always being cheated on.

570
00:34:39,655 --> 00:34:45,135
Good, it's time to start my plan.

571
00:34:45,945 --> 00:34:48,035
There's a sudden power outage at home.

572
00:34:48,035 --> 00:34:50,235
I called the property management office.

573
00:34:50,235 --> 00:34:52,645
They said the circuit is all right.

574
00:34:52,645 --> 00:34:55,515
You used to pay all the electricity bills at home

575
00:34:55,515 --> 00:34:57,634
and I'm not sure what the situation is.

576
00:34:57,634 --> 00:34:59,845
It's so dark inside the house now.

577
00:34:59,845 --> 00:35:02,265
I'm so scared!

578
00:35:04,825 --> 00:35:07,785
<i>Have you lit the candles? I'll go back and check.</i>

579
00:35:49,985 --> 00:35:52,815
I already paid the electricity bill when I came.

580
00:35:52,815 --> 00:35:54,364
The power will be restored soon.

581
00:35:54,364 --> 00:35:56,005
I'll leave now.

582
00:35:56,955 --> 00:35:58,814
Don't rush off yet.

583
00:35:58,814 --> 00:36:01,265
Stay and have a seat.

584
00:36:03,885 --> 00:36:05,895
I'm not sitting down.

585
00:36:05,895 --> 00:36:07,985
I'll check the switch.

586
00:36:08,785 --> 00:36:10,125
No need.

587
00:36:10,125 --> 00:36:11,605
I've already checked.

588
00:36:11,605 --> 00:36:13,685
There is no problem.

589
00:36:14,475 --> 00:36:17,144
Since it's not the case of unpaid bills or a problem with the switch,

590
00:36:17,144 --> 00:36:19,685
then someone must have fabricated things.

591
00:36:23,435 --> 00:36:27,465
What if it short-circuited itself?

592
00:36:28,775 --> 00:36:31,775
It makes sense. I'll check it out.

593
00:36:44,745 --> 00:36:48,235
Does it matter if the power is restored or not?

594
00:36:48,235 --> 00:36:51,735
Did you miss me?

595
00:37:02,815 --> 00:37:04,485
In the future, remember,

596
00:37:04,485 --> 00:37:06,844
only the main switch will trip during a power trip,

597
00:37:06,844 --> 00:37:09,085
and not a row of switches.

598
00:37:10,585 --> 00:37:13,185
The electricity I paid for you is enough to last you a year

599
00:37:13,185 --> 00:37:15,585
as long as you don't purposely short it out.

600
00:37:15,585 --> 00:37:17,465
Get some rest early.

601
00:37:41,265 --> 00:37:42,434
Is there any food?

602
00:37:42,434 --> 00:37:43,494
No.

603
00:37:43,494 --> 00:37:45,064
- Are you hungry?
- Yes.

604
00:37:45,105 --> 00:37:46,364
Let's go out to eat.

605
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,625
Okay! Coming.

606
00:37:49,625 --> 00:37:51,265
Let's go.

00:37:57,024 --> 00:37:59,085
It's good.

Take your time, no one's competing with you.

610

Have you been hungry for days?

611
00:38:11,205 --> 00:38:13,855
I'm fully revived. Our country is better.

612
00:38:13,855 --> 00:38:16,775
There are only burgers and pizzas at this hour abroad.

613
00:38:18,395 --> 00:38:20,065
Why are you laughing?

614
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:22,024
I'm really pitiful now.

615
00:38:22,024 --> 00:38:25,264
In order to take Alice home, I can only live by credit card now.

616
00:38:25,264 --> 00:38:28,465
You're a wage earner now, don't just splurge.

617
00:38:28,465 --> 00:38:32,574
I didn't splurge. Alice can guarantee my success in the race.

618
00:38:32,574 --> 00:38:36,365
Is this a race superstition?

619

I have to endure hardships.

I'm not only exploited by my leader

622
00:38:44,814 --> 00:38:48,395
but also pestered by a little girl.

623
00:38:48,395 --> 00:38:50,235
A little girl?

624
00:38:50,235 --> 00:38:52,325
Li Yanran?

625

You've heard it?

626
00:38:55,135 --> 00:38:58,454
I've heard a little. I've seen her profile.

627

You two were schoolmates?

Not only that.

629

Then, what's your relationship?

630
00:39:07,885 --> 00:39:11,675
That girl is definitely not easy to handle.

<i>You have to protect me when we grow up and get married.</i>

<i>He's not yours no matter how hot he is.</i>

00:40:05,024 --> 00:40:06,994
How humiliating that would be!

645
00:40:06,994 --> 00:40:09,335
Well, I can't say yes to her, can I?

646
00:40:09,335 --> 00:40:12,445
It would be irresponsible to say yes to her if I really don't like her.

647
00:40:12,445 --> 00:40:14,404
Then, why don't you just make it clear to her?

648
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:16,275
I made it clear.

649
00:40:16,275 --> 00:40:19,115
You don't know that Li Yanran has been very clingy since young.

650
00:40:19,115 --> 00:40:23,034
As long as she doesn't give up herself, it's useless to say anything.

651
00:40:24,635 --> 00:40:29,275
Then, what if you like her but you don't know it?

652
00:40:29,275 --> 00:40:30,955
Impossible!

653
00:40:30,955 --> 00:40:34,255
I know exactly who I like and who I don't like.

654
00:40:46,155 --> 00:40:48,265
But sometimes I'm not so clear.

655
00:40:51,635 --> 00:40:53,165
Why?

656
00:40:54,365 --> 00:40:56,195
There's no reason.

657
00:41:02,535 --> 00:41:04,365
Busy tomorrow?

658
00:41:05,155 --> 00:41:07,195
Xu Ningyuan asked me out.

659
00:41:07,195 --> 00:41:09,325
He asked you out again?

660
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,685
Why?

661
00:41:11,685 --> 00:41:14,695
Nothing, he's quite efficient.

662
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:16,715
Shall I teach you more tricks?

663
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:20,844
No need. Keep your tricks to yourself.

664
00:41:25,300 --> 00:41:27,500
Boss. Two more trotters, please.

665
00:41:27,600 --> 00:41:30,000
Okay. Right away, Handsome.

666
00:41:31,295 --> 00:41:32,585
Want to have some?

667
00:41:32,585 --> 00:41:33,815
Yes!

668
00:41:33,815 --> 00:41:35,235
Add two more.

669
00:41:35,235 --> 00:41:37,244
Handsome, you see, our pig's trotters are quite big.

670
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:39,344
You eat them first, I'll add more if it's not enough. Okay?

671
00:41:39,344 --> 00:41:41,555
We can finish them all.

672
00:41:41,555 --> 00:41:43,535
Order whatever you want.

673
00:41:43,535 --> 00:41:45,795
We can order more noodles.

674
00:42:01,580 --> 00:42:05,510
[How to make your ex constantly think of you?]

675
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,004
What are you doing?
<i>[Ways to make your ex regret]</i>

676
00:42:15,004 --> 00:42:18,165
- "Ways to make your ex regret."
- Return it to me!

677
00:42:18,925 --> 00:42:21,735
I have a friend who was dumped by a scumbag last week.

678
00:42:21,735 --> 00:42:24,505
I just feel it's unfair for her.

679
00:42:24,505 --> 00:42:26,645
Why do we have to cry for nothing

680
00:42:26,645 --> 00:42:28,755
when we are dumped by a scumbag?

681
00:42:28,755 --> 00:42:31,844
So I'm using Love Note to learn and find some solutions.

682
00:42:31,844 --> 00:42:33,505
What did it say?

683
00:42:33,505 --> 00:42:35,785
- Teach me.
- I'll learn, too.

684
00:42:35,785 --> 00:42:39,964
You see. First of all, it is important to reflect on your mentality.

685
00:42:39,964 --> 00:42:43,744
If you've been dumped, you need to stop being resentful and don't pester him.

686
00:42:43,744 --> 00:42:45,575
Make use of a man's curiosity

687
00:42:45,575 --> 00:42:48,784
to stimulate his desire to get to know you again.

688
00:42:48,784 --> 00:42:51,875
- How to stimulate?
- Use social media.

689
00:42:51,875 --> 00:42:55,094
Social media is a window into our daily lives.

690
00:42:55,094 --> 00:42:58,744
At the same time, it is also a window for our exes to observe us.

691
00:42:58,744 --> 00:43:02,734
Look. There's more. The stimulation should deepen gradually.

692
00:43:02,734 --> 00:43:05,225
Be quiet at the beginning of the breakup,

693
00:43:05,225 --> 00:43:09,054
then slowly display your advantages bit by bit.

694
00:43:09,054 --> 00:43:11,124
Just post some nice selfies,

695
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:13,055
photos of gatherings with male and female friends

696
00:43:13,055 --> 00:43:15,055
and some high-quality photos taken by someone else.

697
00:43:15,055 --> 00:43:16,735
When the person is attracted to you again

698
00:43:16,735 --> 00:43:19,955
and comes to chat with you, you have succeeded.

699
00:43:19,955 --> 00:43:22,475
Amazing!

700
00:43:22,475 --> 00:43:26,225
Are you the friend who got dumped?

701
00:43:27,915 --> 00:43:29,074
No, I'm not!

702
00:43:29,075 --> 00:43:31,610
It's you! Not me!
