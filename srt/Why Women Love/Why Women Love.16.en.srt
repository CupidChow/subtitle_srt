You're here? I didn't see you earlier.

00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:40,000
- I had something on, so I came late.
- It's all right.

Yes. Let Mr. Xu and Ms. Zhao have a look there.

Ms. Zhao, something's happening there. Let's go and have a look.

Do you know?

56
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:01,940
I think that Jiaxin has changed a lot recently.

57
00:03:01,940 --> 00:03:04,130
The application says that

58
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:07,500
a love that is good will cause a man to mature.

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:09,029
I think that after I confessed,

60
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,130
Jiaxin really matured a lot.

61
00:03:13,340 --> 00:03:16,490
I think that my dream is about to be realized.

62
00:03:16,490 --> 00:03:18,170
How about you?

63
00:03:18,170 --> 00:03:19,749
Me? Maybe.

64
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:22,599
Last night, I received an email from her.

65
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:24,059
Email? What email?

66
00:03:24,059 --> 00:03:25,700
A confession?

67
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:27,009
Don't be so loud.

68
00:03:27,009 --> 00:03:31,670
Is spring finally coming to a withered tree?

69
00:03:31,670 --> 00:03:33,650
Look at your dark eye circles.

70
00:03:33,650 --> 00:03:37,749
Last night, were you so excited that you didn't sleep well?

71
00:03:39,670 --> 00:03:41,650
Couples must wear paper bracelets to enter,

72
00:03:41,650 --> 00:03:43,010
or they may be asked to leave.

73
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:43,730
We are not a couple.

74

75
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:49,080
Hold this.

76
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,469
Come on, let's put on our love alliance bracelet.

77
00:03:52,470 --> 00:03:55,749

78
00:03:55,750 --> 00:03:56,829

What's the situation? I arrived here first.

84
00:04:05,359 --> 00:04:07,359
- What happened?
- I queued up first. Why are you cutting in line?

85
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,509
These two women were coincidentally matched with this man

86
00:04:09,509 --> 00:04:10,919
and both want to be a couple with him for a day.

87
00:04:10,919 --> 00:04:12,929
The matchmaker suggested matching them with others but they disagreed.

88
00:04:12,929 --> 00:04:15,989
The man offered to spend one hour with each woman, but that didn't work.

89
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:17,349
Hence, they got into an argument.

90
00:04:17,350 --> 00:04:18,359
Just because you're happy to?

91
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:20,870
You want to snatch him from me because you think he's handsome, right?

92
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:22,919
He doesn't like you.

93
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,329
If he did, but that didn't work.

94
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:27,599
Look at your appearance.

95
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,300
You look like that and you dare to come out to embarrass yourself?

96

<i>- Who are you calling "Ma'am"?</i>

98

99
00:04:36,239 --> 00:04:37,450

100
00:04:37,450 --> 00:04:38,549

101
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,629
Don't. Stop fighting.

102
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,939

112
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:00,010
How are you?

113
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,279
<i>- Don't.</i>
- I'm okay.

114
00:05:01,279 --> 00:05:03,220

00:05:04,489 --> 00:05:06,040

117
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,030
<i>Look at you.</i>

118
00:05:25,030 --> 00:05:27,850

- Calm down!

00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:36,850
Stop fighting!

123
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,780
No. Calm down.

124
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:57,890
Duoxi, right? These flowers are for you.

125
00:05:57,890 --> 00:05:59,720
Thank you.

126
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:01,050
Sorry, excuse me.

127
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:03,840
Well... Have a drink.

128
00:06:06,420 --> 00:06:11,099
To be honest, I was forced by my family to come for a blind date.

129
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:13,780
I know that you have a boyfriend who is poor.

130
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:15,300
But that's okay.

131
00:06:15,300 --> 00:06:18,050
My impression of you isn't bad.

132
00:06:18,050 --> 00:06:21,850
Besides, you are the type that I like.

133
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:26,840
During the last two years, I've seen a lot of women.

134
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:28,700
I want to settle down now.

135
00:06:28,700 --> 00:06:33,720
So, if you can break up with your boyfriend as soon as possible,

136
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:36,790
I think I can wait for you.

137
00:06:41,040 --> 00:06:43,349
No need. I'm a stubborn person.

138
00:06:43,349 --> 00:06:45,460
Once I've made up my mind, I won't change.

139
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:47,820
Although my boyfriend doesn't have money now,

140
00:06:47,820 --> 00:06:50,899
I am willing to be by his side and fight alongside him.

141
00:06:51,860 --> 00:06:55,459
Little girl, you're talking about your first love. Right?

142
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:59,809
I admit your first love is definitely the one you like the most.

143
00:06:59,809 --> 00:07:03,850
- But he is definitely not the best one.
- <i>(Curse you!)</i>

144
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:05,759
Don't look down on yourself.

145
00:07:05,760 --> 00:07:08,630
I think you deserve someone better.

146
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:12,199
My boyfriend is the most outstanding person in the world.

147
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,419
You don't know him, so you don't have the right to judge him.

148
00:07:17,130 --> 00:07:19,830
Hey, little girl.

149
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,550
Baby, don't worry.

150
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,070
I will definitely give you the best things in the world.

151
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:05,070
It hurts.

152
00:08:06,100 --> 00:08:07,799
- You're done?
- Thank you.

153
00:08:07,799 --> 00:08:10,070
You wrapped it so simply, will it leave a scar?

154
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,440
Don't worry, it won't.

155
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,379
Remember to redress the wound at night. Don't let it touch water.

156
00:08:14,379 --> 00:08:16,339
- Okay.
- You heard that?

157
00:08:16,339 --> 00:08:17,850
I heard that.

158
00:08:17,850 --> 00:08:19,520
You're still smiling?

159
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:24,739
Sir, if Jiaxin worried about me the way you do, that'd be nice.

160
00:08:24,739 --> 00:08:28,299
Do you think they've settled the argument over there?

161
00:08:28,299 --> 00:08:30,320
You still have the heart to worry about others?

162
00:08:30,320 --> 00:08:31,789
Worry about yourself.

163
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:35,749
Before you love someone, you must learn to love yourself first. Got it?

164
00:08:35,749 --> 00:08:37,420
I got it.

165
00:08:37,420 --> 00:08:42,059
I realized that every time I get hurt, you are there to help me.

166
00:08:42,059 --> 00:08:45,819
You are so nice, but why won't Ms. Zhao accept you?

167
00:08:45,819 --> 00:08:49,440
Because of that, the two of us are suffering here.

168
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:19,110
Why didn't you tell me before taking your clothes off?

169
00:09:19,110 --> 00:09:20,690
Give it to me.

170
00:09:22,370 --> 00:09:24,400
How do I change if you don't give it to me?

171
00:09:36,510 --> 00:09:39,740
Do you know why my mom revealed my identity?

172
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:46,250
Because it isn't a secret anymore.

173
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,300
Because I made a warrior's oath in front of my mom.

174
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:53,450
<i>Mom, I've made up my mind.</i>

175
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
<i>I'll stay in the company.</i>

176
00:09:56,200 --> 00:09:58,200
<i>This key represents my determination.</i>

177
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:01,270
<i>Turning in your keys is just a gesture.</i>

178
00:10:01,270 --> 00:10:02,880
<i>It doesn't represent determination.</i>

179
00:10:02,880 --> 00:10:06,330
<i>You always said that I haven't grown up and that I'm immature.</i>

180
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:08,610
<i>I will let you see how I've changed.</i>

181
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:11,790
<i>All right, I'll look forward to it.</i>

182
00:10:15,710 --> 00:10:21,410
So you've been working so hard to show your efforts to Ms. Jin?

183
00:10:24,670 --> 00:10:26,270
I did it for you.

184
00:10:27,280 --> 00:10:30,920
I want to let you see that I can work hard.

185
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:33,450
I can become mature.

186
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:36,400
I can be a man who gives you security.

187
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:40,000
What about your dreams of racing?

188
00:10:40,400 --> 00:10:43,230
For you, I've decided to put racing aside for now.

189
00:10:45,370 --> 00:10:48,080
I want to stay by the side of the person I love.

190
00:10:48,960 --> 00:10:53,470
I know you may still have concerns about my feelings.

191
00:10:53,470 --> 00:10:55,150
I've thought it through.

192
00:10:55,150 --> 00:10:57,959
I will not childishly pester you for answers again.

193
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:00,110
But I hope...

194
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:04,970
you can face me as frankly as when you're with Xu Ningyuan.

195
00:11:04,970 --> 00:11:08,979
Do not have ill feelings towards me. Do not be distant from me.

196
00:11:08,979 --> 00:11:14,020
If there are rumors, I will protect you.

197
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,760
Jiaxin...

198
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:22,950
I don't want you to become another person because of me.

199
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:24,200
I don't want you to be unhappy.

200
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:25,710
I'm willing.

201
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:35,490
I like you.

202
00:11:36,790 --> 00:11:40,390
For you, I can do anything.

203
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:44,569
<i>But if the result of liking me is you sacrificing yourself,</i>

204
00:11:44,569 --> 00:11:49,009
<i>I would rather you give everything up and be yourself.</i>

205
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:58,310
Gu Jiaxin, can you not force her?

206
00:11:58,310 --> 00:12:01,080
I'm sorry, we are not done talking.

207
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:03,470
Then talk later.

208
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:09,340
- Jiangyue, the email you sent me yesterday...
- Don't get ahead of yourself.

209
00:12:09,340 --> 00:12:11,400
I sent it to you.

210
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,869
With Zhao Jiangyue's personality, how is it possible for her to send an email like that?

211
00:12:14,869 --> 00:12:17,060
You don't know her at all.

212
00:12:21,670 --> 00:12:24,010
What are you talking about?

213
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:38,830
I'm sorry. I didn't know something like this happened.

214
00:12:38,830 --> 00:12:40,860
You don't have to apologize.

215
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:45,470
It's good, actually. I can use this chance to ask you.

216
00:12:45,470 --> 00:12:47,470
Do you still like me?

217
00:12:49,840 --> 00:12:52,500
You don't have to think of anyone's opinion.

218
00:12:53,280 --> 00:12:56,420
I just want your most honest thoughts.

219
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,230
No matter who sent the email, I received it.

220
00:13:01,230 --> 00:13:05,660
Do you hope that I reject it or accept it?

221
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:11,880
I'm sorry.

222
00:13:20,200 --> 00:13:22,060
It's good.

223
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,820
Jiangyue, now you are very mature.

224
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,520
Very strong.

225
00:13:28,520 --> 00:13:30,400
Although you've changed,

226
00:13:31,670 --> 00:13:33,740
in my eyes,

227
00:13:33,740 --> 00:13:37,010
you are still the you whose eyes cannot lie.

228
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:40,810
It's good we've talked about this.

229
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:43,300
We can continue to be friends.

230
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,030
I'll get going.

231
00:14:08,740 --> 00:14:11,420
<i>[Today, I finally mustered up my courage...]</i>

232
00:14:16,660 --> 00:14:20,639
<i>[Hanhai Investment]</i>

233
00:14:20,640 --> 00:14:23,760
<i>Hello, Mr. Xu.</i>

234
00:14:24,420 --> 00:14:25,700
<i>[and said, "Master, I like you."]</i>

235
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:39,270
<i>What are you doing?</i>

236
00:14:39,270 --> 00:14:41,590
<i>- So clumsy.
- I'm sorry.</i>

237
00:14:41,590 --> 00:14:43,959
<i>Take the contract to the legal department and make a new copy.</i>

238
00:14:43,960 --> 00:14:47,159
<i>- Hand it over in the afternoon.
- Okay. I'll do it right away.</i>

239
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,379
You've worked hard, thank you.

240
00:15:01,379 --> 00:15:02,439
No problem.

241
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,500
Let's collaborate more in the future.

242
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,529
- All right.
- Thank you.

243
00:15:07,670 --> 00:15:08,690
Gather!

244
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:10,270
- Why?
- What's up?

245
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:12,430
Come on, good news!

246
00:15:12,430 --> 00:15:15,109
- What's the matter?
- Why are you being so mysterious?

247
00:15:15,109 --> 00:15:20,000
To celebrate the successful conclusion of Love Market,

248
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:24,439
Ms. Jin made reservations at a seafood restaurant for a luxurious celebratory meal!

249
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:30,000
Sure enough, we get to enjoy good food if we follow Master Gu!

250
00:15:30,910 --> 00:15:31,759
Good!

251
00:15:31,760 --> 00:15:33,330
Have fun tonight, everyone!

252
00:15:33,330 --> 00:15:35,730
I won't be going.

253
00:15:35,730 --> 00:15:38,129
Enjoy yourselves and pack up quickly.

254
00:15:38,129 --> 00:15:39,669
<i>All right, let's pack up and go for our meal!</i>

255
00:15:39,670 --> 00:15:41,899
<i>- Let's go.
- Come on, keep those tables there.</i>

256
00:15:41,899 --> 00:15:43,599
<i>- Okay.
- Come here, help me move those chairs.</i>

257
00:15:43,599 --> 00:15:45,179
<i>- Help me.
- All right, quickly.</i>

258
00:15:45,179 --> 00:15:47,790
<i>Keep those flowers, too.</i>

259
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:53,499
Bottoms up! To better lives, bottoms up!

260
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:57,279
- Okay!
<i>- Cheers!</i>

261
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:12,780
Everyone!

262
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:13,940
I'm fine.

263
00:16:13,940 --> 00:16:17,129
Everyone! Today's Love Market is a great success

264
00:16:17,129 --> 00:16:18,519
and everyone worked hard.

265
00:16:18,520 --> 00:16:20,569
You are all happy and I'm happy, too.

266
00:16:20,569 --> 00:16:23,609
- I'd like to propose a toast to everyone.
- Yanran, you've reached your limit. Stop drinking.

267
00:16:23,609 --> 00:16:24,619
I'm fine.

268
00:16:24,619 --> 00:16:25,709
You've drunk enough, so stop drinking.

269
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,529
- Cheers! Come on.
- Come on.

270
00:16:27,540 --> 00:16:28,770
All right.

271
00:16:28,770 --> 00:16:30,399
<i>Cheers!</i>

272
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,110
Everyone's happy.

273
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,710
Where's Jiaxin? Why isn't he here yet?

274
00:16:38,710 --> 00:16:42,809
He said he has something to do at the office.

275
00:16:42,809 --> 00:16:47,059
Speaking of it, Jiaxin has been very hardworking recently.

276
00:16:47,059 --> 00:16:48,569
All right, let's not talk about him anymore.

277
00:16:48,569 --> 00:16:49,959
Let's drink and eat.

278
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:52,760
- Come on!
- Don't waste the food.

279
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:55,490
<i>Jiaxin, where are you going?</i>

280
00:16:55,490 --> 00:16:57,029
<i>Aren't you joining us for the gathering?</i>

281
00:16:57,030 --> 00:16:58,319
<i>I'm going to check on Ms. Zhao.</i>

282
00:16:58,320 --> 00:17:01,679
<i>I'm injured. Can't you stay?</i>

283
00:17:01,679 --> 00:17:06,480
<i>Yanran, I've already made things clear to you.</i>

284
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:09,820
<i>I thought you'd changed.</i>

285
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:13,559
<i>I thought you are willing to stay in the company and work.</i>

286
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:15,760
<i>I thought that you were changing.</i>

287
00:17:15,760 --> 00:17:18,980
<i>You're right. I'm working hard to change.</i>

288
00:17:18,980 --> 00:17:21,130
<i>But it's not because of you.</i>

289
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,429
<i>Liang, if you can drink, you should drink more.</i>

290
00:17:28,430 --> 00:17:30,469
<i>What are you doing? I can't reach it.</i>

291
00:17:30,469 --> 00:17:31,830
<i>I'll help you.</i>

292
00:17:31,830 --> 00:17:34,160
<i>Okay, thank you.</i>

293
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:35,960
<i>Let's cheers!</i>

294
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:38,230
<i>Come on!</i>

295
00:17:57,190 --> 00:17:58,950
Are you okay?

296
00:18:00,950 --> 00:18:02,860
I'm fine.

297
00:18:04,920 --> 00:18:07,969
You don't have to care about me. Go to the gathering.

298
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,830
I'm on a diet.

299
00:18:48,590 --> 00:18:50,620
We've had fun, right?

300
00:18:50,620 --> 00:18:52,020
Did you guys have fun?

301
00:18:52,020 --> 00:18:53,419
Stop shouting, it's embarrassing.

302
00:18:53,419 --> 00:18:54,840
He's too heavy.

303
00:18:54,840 --> 00:18:56,740
Don't go!

304
00:18:56,740 --> 00:18:59,129
- Enough.
- Bye!

305
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:01,379
Why don't we drink more?

306
00:19:01,379 --> 00:19:03,500
Enough!

307
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:04,500
Yanran, are you okay?

308
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,429
I'm fine, you should send them back.

309
00:19:06,430 --> 00:19:08,610
Jiaxin will definitely pick me up later.

310
00:19:08,610 --> 00:19:10,280
Get in.

311
00:19:10,280 --> 00:19:12,720
You're sure Jiaxin will come?

312
00:19:13,720 --> 00:19:16,519
Look, I'm injured. Jiaxin will definitely come.

313
00:19:16,519 --> 00:19:18,640
- Yanran, let's drink!
- Go back quickly.

314
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,759
Slowly.

315
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:21,049
Okay, I'll send him back.

316
00:19:21,049 --> 00:19:23,279
- We'll get going. Bye.
- Bye.

317
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:36,940

<i> - Hello, Ms. Jin.</i>

We are facing a crisis. The company needs more power.

Let's welcome Song Xue back to the company.

Everyone, long time no see.

00:25:42,070 --> 00:25:44,879
Ms. Song has a lot of experience dealing with crises.

She will preside over today's meeting.

Have a seat.

390
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:53,709
I didn't expect to face such a troublesome situation the moment I came back.

391
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,470
Turn off the projector.

392
00:25:58,470 --> 00:26:00,999
I don't like to talk nonsense.

393
00:26:01,000 --> 00:26:04,920
From now on, the Love Note project shall be managed by me.

394
00:26:04,920 --> 00:26:08,410
The most urgent issue we must address is public opinion.

395
00:26:08,410 --> 00:26:11,570
This project has always been managed by Ms. Zhao.

396
00:26:11,570 --> 00:26:14,860
In times of crisis, changing the leader

397
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:17,830
may be confusing for everyone.

398
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,650
Love Note has a users' crisis now

399
00:26:19,650 --> 00:26:24,280
because it is directly related to Qian Jingjing's divorce.

400
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:27,559
Although Ms. Zhao has always been impartial,

401
00:26:27,560 --> 00:26:30,109
she has personal relations with Qian Jingjing.

402
00:26:30,110 --> 00:26:33,110
Sometimes, she keeps information from the company.

403
00:26:33,110 --> 00:26:35,309
Those closely involved cannot see clearly.

404
00:26:35,310 --> 00:26:38,249
I believe that the new arrangement will prevent

405
00:26:38,249 --> 00:26:42,609
mistakes caused by personal feelings in the workplace.

406
00:26:43,900 --> 00:26:47,480
Ms. Song is right. I should be held responsible for this matter.

407
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:50,229
I knew about the divorce, but I did not reveal it

408
00:26:50,230 --> 00:26:53,520
because Qian Jingjing and Zhang Hao reached an agreement in private.

409
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:56,230
This was supposed to be a personal matter.

410
00:26:56,230 --> 00:26:58,799
There must be someone behind the sudden exposure of this issue.

411
00:26:58,800 --> 00:27:01,590
I will definitely find this person and resolve this.

412
00:27:01,590 --> 00:27:05,780
Save the case for later. Let's hear Ms. Song's suggestions.

413
00:27:09,800 --> 00:27:13,180
This crisis occurred not only because of Qian Jingjing's divorce alone,

414
00:27:13,180 --> 00:27:17,280
but also because of the series of scandals that emerged following the scandals of her divorce.

415
00:27:17,280 --> 00:27:18,999
They had already divorced,

416
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:20,679
but they still displayed affection publicly
<i>["Qian Jingjing's Divorce Scandal" Analysis]</i>

417
00:27:20,680 --> 00:27:21,999
to acquire traffic through deception.

418
00:27:22,000 --> 00:27:25,679
She went on a date with a lawyer with a bad reputation.

419
00:27:25,680 --> 00:27:28,279
An ugly woman who went through plastic surgery
<i>[Dating a controversial person]</i>

420
00:27:28,280 --> 00:27:30,459
and became the Queen of Love.

421
00:27:30,459 --> 00:27:33,880
A woman who failed at love but is teaching others how to fall in love.

422
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:36,109
This is essentially deception,

423
00:27:36,110 --> 00:27:39,189
which damaged the trust between our application and users.

424
00:27:39,230 --> 00:27:42,999
Such damage, if not remedied in time,

425
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,679
will cause an irreversible impact.

426
00:27:44,680 --> 00:27:46,999
Hence, my solution is first,

427
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:50,640
terminate the contract with Qian Jingjing as soon as possible and release a public statement.

428
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:53,279
Find another endorser quickly

429
00:27:53,280 --> 00:27:57,070
and revamp our teaching course.

430
00:27:57,070 --> 00:27:59,010
Where is Qian Jingjing now?

431
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,420
She is currently not contactable.

432
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:05,210
Jiangyue, can't you get in touch with her?

433
00:28:08,490 --> 00:28:11,200
Then we can go straight to the legal process.

434
00:28:11,200 --> 00:28:12,920
After all, she violated the contract first.

435
00:28:12,920 --> 00:28:15,920
Give me some time. I will definitely get in touch with her today.

436
00:28:15,920 --> 00:28:20,920
Let's hurry. In one day we must come up with a solution.

437
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,310
<i>He's really the best ex.</i>

438
00:28:57,310 --> 00:29:00,310
<i>He runs away faster than anyone when something's wrong.</i>

439
00:29:02,190 --> 00:29:05,109
- Lin?
- Jingjing?

440
00:29:06,210 --> 00:29:10,420
What happened? Where's everyone? Has the company moved?

441
00:29:10,420 --> 00:29:12,450
Hao's company has gone bankrupt.

442
00:29:12,450 --> 00:29:14,270
The employees were all laid off.

443
00:29:14,270 --> 00:29:16,260
I'm here to help Hao clean up the mess.

444
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,480
Bankrupt?

445
00:29:22,310 --> 00:29:24,530
<i>Hao has been keeping this from you.</i>

446
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:27,100
<i> He specifically told us not to tell you about this.</i>

447
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,160
Actually, he divorced you

448
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:33,760
because he was afraid that the debt problems after bankruptcy would affect you.

449
00:29:33,760 --> 00:29:38,040
That's impossible. He met other girls secretly. He admitted it to me himself.

450
00:29:38,040 --> 00:29:39,739
He did that on purpose.

451
00:29:39,739 --> 00:29:42,170
Jingjing, think about it. I'm his secretary.

452
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,560
To avoid suspicion, he even hired a male secretary.

453
00:29:44,560 --> 00:29:47,480
<i>Do you think he will do anything to betray you?</i>

454
00:30:01,640 --> 00:30:04,480
Little Aunt! Little Aunt, you're finally back.

455
00:30:04,490 --> 00:30:09,190
- Song Xue is such a bully. I want to report her to Ms. Jin.
- What's wrong?

456
00:30:09,190 --> 00:30:11,680
Ms. Song said that she's used to her old office,

457
00:30:11,680 --> 00:30:15,669
and told administrative personnel to clear out the office without discussing it with you.

458
00:30:16,490 --> 00:30:19,000
What is Song Xue trying to do?

459
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:23,680
It's okay. You don't have to worry about this. Go and eat. I'll handle it.

460
00:30:23,680 --> 00:30:25,280
Let's go.

461
00:30:27,490 --> 00:30:31,250
What is my mom thinking? Calling Song Xue back at this time,

462
00:30:31,250 --> 00:30:33,670
is she purposely making life hard for you?

463
00:30:35,280 --> 00:30:37,300
I'll go and see her.

464
00:30:38,440 --> 00:30:40,620
I understand Ms. Jin's decision.

465
00:30:40,620 --> 00:30:42,880
After all, the company isn't a charity.

466
00:30:42,880 --> 00:30:45,280
Everything is based on profit.

467
00:30:45,280 --> 00:30:48,590
Besides, in this issue, I have responsibility.

468
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,760
But I don't want you to feel wronged.

469
00:30:55,760 --> 00:30:59,830
It's okay. Let's go take a look at the office.

470
00:31:14,160 --> 00:31:16,730
Ms. Zhao. Sorry.

471
00:31:16,730 --> 00:31:20,040
I should have discussed with you beforehand about changing offices,

472
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,830
but I have an appointment with an important client, and I didn't see you earlier,

473
00:31:23,830 --> 00:31:26,010
so I acted first before telling you.

474
00:31:26,010 --> 00:31:29,540
Oh, yes, I told administration personnel to clean up a new office for you.

475
00:31:29,540 --> 00:31:30,910
It'll be ready in a few days.

476
00:31:30,910 --> 00:31:33,820
You'll have to put up with that for a while.

477
00:31:33,820 --> 00:31:36,249
Ms. Song, for matters like changing offices,

478
00:31:36,249 --> 00:31:39,760
you should have asked her beforehand.

479
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,120
Jiaxin, look at you.

480
00:31:45,880 --> 00:31:49,640
You joined the company late so you do not understand some things.

481
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:52,969
Before I left, Jiangyue was my subordinate.

482
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:55,610
After I got married and had my baby, she got promoted up to my position.

483
00:31:55,610 --> 00:32:00,420
I know her well. To her, work efficiency is always number one.

484
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:04,129
Everything else doesn't matter. Right?

485
00:32:05,610 --> 00:32:09,040
And for me, I'm nostalgic.

486
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,660
I've been staying in this office so long that I can't bear to leave it now.

487
00:32:15,860 --> 00:32:20,920
Jiangyue, I think you definitely understand this.

488
00:32:24,590 --> 00:32:28,180
It's fine. You can use this office.

489
00:32:28,180 --> 00:32:30,170
But I want to pack my things myself.

490
00:32:30,170 --> 00:32:32,859
There are some important documents that I don't want to lose.

491
00:32:32,859 --> 00:32:34,270
Sure.

492
00:32:36,040 --> 00:32:38,040
You can take your time.

493
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:39,480
Let's go.

494
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:58,800
Sir, are you free?

495
00:32:58,800 --> 00:33:00,610
I want to have a word with you.

496
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:09,850
She was trying to crack the whip.

497
00:33:10,400 --> 00:33:13,689
My mom let her come back but didn't ask her to take your office.

498
00:33:23,230 --> 00:33:25,000
It's quite nice to sit here.

499
00:33:25,000 --> 00:33:26,540
Have you gone mad because you're pissed off?

500
00:33:26,540 --> 00:33:29,990
When I first entered the company, I sat here.

501
00:33:30,800 --> 00:33:33,590
I'm reminded of the past.

502
00:33:34,310 --> 00:33:36,210
After working hard for so long,

503
00:33:36,210 --> 00:33:41,280
it's a not bad thing to think about how I started.

504
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,300
You... You think for the company no matter what.

505
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:47,570
Can't you think for yourself for once?

506
00:33:47,570 --> 00:33:50,629
The most important thing now is to resolve the crisis.

507
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:52,430
We can't waste time.

508
00:33:52,430 --> 00:33:54,170
We have to work hard.

509
00:33:54,170 --> 00:33:57,260
Okay, I'll help you to organize things.

510
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:09,120
My notebook is gone.

511
00:34:11,080 --> 00:34:12,229
Is it this?

512
00:34:12,230 --> 00:34:14,670
No, this is this year's notebook.

513
00:34:14,670 --> 00:34:16,909
Since I entered the company, I kept one notebook a year.

514
00:34:16,910 --> 00:34:18,629
I placed them in a cardboard box.

515
00:34:18,630 --> 00:34:21,460
Those are all my notebooks for work.

516
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,700
I can't lose them.

517
00:34:24,430 --> 00:34:26,140
Don't worry.

518
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:28,020
Let's ask the administrative personnel.

519
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,149
Wang, I have a cardboard box with all my notebooks, did you see it?

520
00:34:33,149 --> 00:34:36,869
- Are the notebooks brown in color? And dated by year?
- Yes.

521
00:34:36,869 --> 00:34:39,119
Ms. Song said those are useless rubbish,

522
00:34:39,120 --> 00:34:40,149
and told us to get rid of them.

523
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,800
They should be in the storeroom now.

524
00:35:08,600 --> 00:35:10,500
It's more convenient like this.

525
00:35:42,470 --> 00:35:43,850
Is this the one?

526
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:51,230
So many?

527
00:35:58,040 --> 00:35:59,940
You're so hardworking.

528
00:36:00,760 --> 00:36:03,940
<i>[Over here, if you pay 69,999 yuan, you can get a boyfriend with an annual salary of one million yuan.]</i>

529
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,939
<i>- Hello.
- I'm here to do a return visit investigation.</i>

530
00:36:06,939 --> 00:36:08,599
<i>All right, please follow me.</i>

531
00:36:08,600 --> 00:36:10,040
<i>Okay.</i>

532
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:11,909
<i>Miss, do you prefer men who are mature,</i>

533
00:36:11,910 --> 00:36:13,840
<i>or those who are young and lively?</i>

534
00:36:13,840 --> 00:36:15,389
<i>I prefer men who are mature.</i>

535
00:36:15,390 --> 00:36:19,039
<i>Over here, if you pay 69,999 yuan a year,</i>

536
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:22,460
<i>you will get a boyfriend with an annual salary of one million yuan.</i>

537
00:36:22,460 --> 00:36:24,319
<i>If you pay 300,000 yuan in one sitting,</i>

538
00:36:24,320 --> 00:36:26,359
<i>you can become a lifelong member.</i>

539
00:36:26,360 --> 00:36:28,040
<i>Success is guaranteed.</i>

540
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:29,279
<i>Even if you get a divorce,</i>

541
00:36:29,280 --> 00:36:31,870
<i>you can come back and find another match for free.</i>

542
00:36:31,870 --> 00:36:36,080
<i>A sum of money can buy you lifelong happiness.</i>

543
00:36:36,080 --> 00:36:39,000
<i>If love can be clearly priced at a certain cost,</i>

544
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:41,880
<i>then I will no longer look forward to falling in love.</i>

545
00:36:43,630 --> 00:36:46,670
This happened in your first year at Link?

546
00:36:46,670 --> 00:36:48,120
Yes.

547
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:52,900
No wonder you no longer believe in love.

548
00:36:58,840 --> 00:37:03,240
People say love is like a ghost.

549
00:37:03,240 --> 00:37:05,570
Everyone has heard of it,

550
00:37:05,570 --> 00:37:07,560
but no one has seen it.

551
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,050
It's not that I don't believe in love.

552
00:37:10,840 --> 00:37:14,360
It's just I don't believe that something that has such a low possibility

553
00:37:14,360 --> 00:37:16,520
of occurring will happen to me.

554
00:37:16,520 --> 00:37:18,709
Rather than hoping for fate,

555
00:37:18,710 --> 00:37:20,570
it's better to put my energy

556
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:23,460
into things that I can see and touch.

557
00:37:24,280 --> 00:37:26,460
Like my career, for example.

558
00:37:28,150 --> 00:37:30,660
But now, even my career isn't doing well.

559
00:37:33,950 --> 00:37:35,800
I'm serious.

560
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:38,700
Difficulties at work are temporary.

561
00:37:38,700 --> 00:37:41,800
As long as we can come up with a better solution than Song Xue,

562
00:37:41,800 --> 00:37:43,770
we will be able to win.

563
00:37:46,190 --> 00:37:48,060
I'm responsible for this.

564
00:37:48,710 --> 00:37:50,560
I'll solve it well.

565
00:37:51,470 --> 00:37:53,740
I don't want you to share my burden.

566
00:37:53,740 --> 00:37:57,739
Do you know why you're categorized as love-incompetent by Jingjing?

567
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,970
It's because you don't know how to rely on others.

568
00:38:00,970 --> 00:38:02,980
No matter what problems you run into,

569
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:06,150
your first thought is to shoulder everything alone.

570
00:38:06,150 --> 00:38:08,000
Aren't you tired?

571
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:12,740
I know that you're anxious and sad.

572
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:16,039
You can tell me.

573
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:19,399
I don't want you to shoulder everything by yourself.

574
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:22,760
If you're sad, you can cry.

575
00:38:22,760 --> 00:38:25,360
My shoulder is here for you to lean on.

576
00:38:59,710 --> 00:39:01,330
Let it out.

577
00:39:02,080 --> 00:39:03,940
Even for just five minutes.

578
00:39:05,840 --> 00:39:07,710
Okay.

579
00:39:07,710 --> 00:39:09,600
Just five minutes.

580
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:55,380
[Is it reliable to use big data to match people together?]

581
00:40:03,000 --> 00:40:08,070
Do you think the big data matchmaking in Love Note is reliable?

582
00:40:08,070 --> 00:40:09,279
Of course.

583
00:40:09,280 --> 00:40:12,799
Before the application was launched, enormous investigations were done on potential users.

584
00:40:12,840 --> 00:40:16,160
What's wrong? You broke up with your boyfriend?

585
00:40:16,160 --> 00:40:20,110
Yes, we weren't compatible, so I dumped him.

586
00:40:20,870 --> 00:40:22,389
The world is so big,

587
00:40:22,390 --> 00:40:25,970
yet I can't find anyone compatible.

588
00:40:25,970 --> 00:40:28,319
Qiuqiu, you should use Love Note!

589
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:30,949
Big data helps you find the right one by matching people's

590
00:40:30,950 --> 00:40:33,039
real behaviors in life and factors, such as

591
00:40:33,040 --> 00:40:35,530
horoscope, personality, and so on.

592
00:40:37,430 --> 00:40:42,479
That's right. With big data, you are not restricted by social circles and locations.

593
00:40:42,479 --> 00:40:43,909
It saves time and is efficient.

594
00:40:43,910 --> 00:40:47,559
But I think we are looking for lifelong partners,

595
00:40:47,560 --> 00:40:49,559
not shopping at a mall,

596
00:40:49,560 --> 00:40:51,740
so we can't be too reliant on data.

597
00:40:51,740 --> 00:40:54,120
Look at Duoxi and Qi Heng,

598
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,119
and Ms. Zhao and Jiaxin.

599
00:40:56,120 --> 00:40:58,000
If you want to find true love,

600
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,709
you have to communicate with each other

601
00:40:59,710 --> 00:41:02,560
and spend time together in real life.
