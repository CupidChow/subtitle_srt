00:10:56,670 --> 00:10:57,889
Everyone, relax.

162
00:10:57,890 --> 00:10:59,730
Follow me.

163
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:07,700
Left, right. Left, right.

164
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,060
Okay, stretch a bit.

165
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:14,330
Okay, pull back.

166
00:11:14,330 --> 00:11:16,350
Okay, now we will try the next movement.

167
00:11:16,350 --> 00:11:18,440
Press your waist against the yoga ball.

168
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:20,379
Okay, slowly.

169
00:11:20,380 --> 00:11:22,630
Lightly move the yoga ball.

170
00:11:22,630 --> 00:11:25,440
Careful. Careful.

171
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,460
Feel the stretch and massage of the yoga ball.

172
00:11:29,460 --> 00:11:31,740
All right. Everyone together.

173
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:34,400
Here, careful.

174
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:37,600
Last 10 seconds. Hang in there.

175
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:41,800
What's wrong with you?

176
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:33,700
Jiangyue!

177
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:37,500
Dad, why are you here?

178
00:12:38,200 --> 00:12:41,800
Jiangyue, I heard from your mom that

179
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:45,800
you had some problems at work.

180
00:12:47,400 --> 00:12:48,800
I'm on vacation.

181
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,600
Vacation?

182
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,800
<i>Dad, why didn't you tell me you were coming?</i>

183
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,400
How interesting.

184
00:13:10,400 --> 00:13:14,000
I have to tell my own daughter that I'm coming.

185
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,000
<i>That's not it.</i>

186
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,900
It's the middle of the day, why are your curtains drawn?

187
00:13:23,900 --> 00:13:25,100
The sunlight is too bright.

188
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:27,400
Dad, change your shoes.

189
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
Do it slowly.

190
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,000
It's all dark, what's going on with you?

191
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:35,400
You didn't clean up again.

192
00:13:35,400 --> 00:13:37,000
That's not it.

193
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:38,400
Look how messy it is.

194
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:40,200
I'll help you open the curtains.

195
00:13:40,200 --> 00:13:41,480
<i>No, no need! Dad. Dad.</i>

196
00:13:41,480 --> 00:13:43,200
The... the sunlight is too bright.

197
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:44,800
Dad. Dad...

198
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:46,700
My eyes haven't been that good recently.

199
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,000
I can't stand the sunlight.

200
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,600
Dad, sit. Don't bother with that. I'll get some water for you.

201
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:56,200
The small details in your life will determine your altitude.

202
00:13:57,800 --> 00:13:59,800
Dad, drink some water.

203
00:14:06,700 --> 00:14:10,200
Did something happen to your company recently?

204
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:12,200
And it happened because of you?

205
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:15,000
- <i>Who did you hear this from?</i>
- <i>I just want to know the result.</i>

206
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,000
Yes or no?

207
00:14:18,400 --> 00:14:20,100
Yes.

208
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:22,600
Call it a vacation

209
00:14:22,600 --> 00:14:26,400
but actually, you were asked to leave. Right?

210
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:27,800
No.

211
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:30,600
I have been too tired recently, so I wanted to rest for a few days.

212
00:14:30,600 --> 00:14:35,500
Jiangyue, what did I tell you when you were young?

213
00:14:35,500 --> 00:14:37,400
Maintain excellence.

214
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,200
<i>[11th Grade Semester 2 Math Monthly Test Paper]
How much would a perfect score be?</i>

215
00:14:41,200 --> 00:14:42,600
<i>150.</i>

216
00:14:42,600 --> 00:14:46,400
<i>What happened to the two marks you lost?</i>

217
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:48,600
<i>I was careless. I counted wrongly.</i>

218
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:57,200
<i>Here.</i>

219
00:14:57,200 --> 00:15:01,000
<i>In the future, bring it back with 150 marks.</i>

220
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,800
<i>I've always been proud of you, but now?</i>

221
00:15:05,800 --> 00:15:08,500
<i>You think about it. How did you do?</i>

222
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,800
Open it and see for yourself.

223
00:15:18,800 --> 00:15:20,700
I brought a small present for you.

224
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:30,500
Dad, can't you give me something with a different shape?

225
00:15:30,500 --> 00:15:36,300
Life is like climbing a huge pyramid.

226
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:39,500
And it gets harder and harder as you climb higher.

227
00:15:39,500 --> 00:15:44,100
I really hope you can quickly reach the top of it,

228
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:46,600
but the premise is that you need to

229
00:15:46,600 --> 00:15:48,400
make a commitment and work hard.

230
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,000
Understand?

231
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:52,500
Yes.

232
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:58,300
What's that?

233
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:00,400
Nothing. You heard it wrongly.

234
00:16:00,400 --> 00:16:01,900
Nothing?

235
00:16:01,900 --> 00:16:04,800
Really? I heard something.

236
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,500
No.

237
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,000
Did you get a small pet...

238
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,400
behind my back?

239
00:16:14,400 --> 00:16:16,700
Yes, yes. I have a small cat.

240
00:16:16,700 --> 00:16:19,000
It's really small.

241
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:24,500
- See.
- He's really small, he's afraid of people.

242
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:26,000
You really don't listen to me as you grow older.

243
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:27,500
- Dad. Dad.
- I heard it somewhere here.

244
00:16:27,500 --> 00:16:30,900
- Don't scare him.
- How many times have I told you having a pet is a distraction.

245
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:32,900
You'll spend your time playing.

246
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:37,400
It's still dirty here.

247
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,400
You're back?

248
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:46,200
I finished cleaning.

249
00:16:46,200 --> 00:16:50,100
It's 240 yuan for three hours.

250
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,840
240 yuan?

251
00:16:59,840 --> 00:17:02,200
Will you take it if I give you another 10 yuan?

252
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,300
Thank you.

253
00:17:05,300 --> 00:17:07,200
Stop acting.

254
00:17:11,100 --> 00:17:12,400
Hello, Sir.

255
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:13,900
Save it.

256
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:18,100
Jiangyue, hiding a man here?

257
00:17:18,100 --> 00:17:20,700
My precious daughter has gotten bolder.

258
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:23,700
I was wondering why you were having so many problems at work recently.

259
00:17:23,700 --> 00:17:27,800
Now, I've found the root of the problem.

260
00:17:27,800 --> 00:17:28,600
- Dad.
- I'm going!

261
00:17:28,600 --> 00:17:30,600
- He's just a cleaner.
- Yes.

262
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,700
- Don't be angry.
- Enough.

263
00:17:33,400 --> 00:17:35,000
Listen.

264
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:39,500
It's better to have an ugly boyfriend.

265
00:17:39,500 --> 00:17:43,700
A good-looking one will only distract you from making progress

266
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,800
and get you hooked onto those meaningless things.

267
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,400
You're not young anymore.

268
00:17:49,400 --> 00:17:51,500
Think about it.

269
00:18:09,410 --> 00:18:10,930
Hey.

270
00:18:14,100 --> 00:18:15,600
Why did you throw it away?

271
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,700
It irritates me.

272
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,600
Your father really doesn't know how to comfort people.

273
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:29,000
He's just like that.

274
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:33,000
He says he's proud of me

275
00:18:33,000 --> 00:18:35,200
but he came to pressure me today.

276
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:38,000
He's afraid I will embarrass him.

277
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,500
I thought my mom was the devil.

278
00:18:43,800 --> 00:18:46,500
It's been hard on you having a father like that.

279
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:49,600
I'm used to it.

280
00:18:50,300 --> 00:18:53,200
<i>You have to put in your best effort every single time.</i>

281
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:57,400
<i>That's how you will have the chance to stand at the top.</i>

282
00:18:59,500 --> 00:19:01,900
<i>I have always remembered what my father said.</i>

283
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:04,200
<i>I have to work hard to better myself.</i>

284
00:19:04,200 --> 00:19:06,400
<i>That way, he will praise me.</i>

285
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
<i>Until that day.</i>

286
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:22,300
<i>I think this is pretty good.</i>

287
00:19:22,300 --> 00:19:25,000
I was afraid my mom would be sad

288
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,200
so I kept it from her.

289
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:30,700
Later, I found out

290
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:33,200
that my mom already knew about it.

291
00:19:33,200 --> 00:19:36,600
Then, are they still together now?

292
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,500
They make do.

293
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:45,000
It's affected you a lot, right?

294
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,200
When I was young,

295
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:51,600
I didn't have Barbie dolls.

296
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,800
Since I was young, my father has been telling me

297
00:19:55,800 --> 00:20:00,500
that this world is in the hands of men.

298
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:02,600
If you want to succeed,

299
00:20:02,600 --> 00:20:05,700
you must surpass men.

300
00:20:06,700 --> 00:20:09,200
So since I was young,

301
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,000
I have been working hard to make myself better.

302
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,600
Actually, in order to becomethe best Zhao Jiangyue,

303
00:20:17,600 --> 00:20:20,600
you go full speed ahead, get strong and independent,

304
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,500
and somewhere along the way

305
00:20:22,500 --> 00:20:25,200
you forgot how to rely on others

306
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,300
and refuse to let anyone in.

307
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,300
You don't know how to love...

308
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:35,000
and you don't dare to. Right?

309
00:20:40,800 --> 00:20:43,500
Here! What you need now

310
00:20:43,500 --> 00:20:45,600
is a Jiaxin-style loving hug.

311
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,200
Come. Come.

312
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,800
Don't do this!

313
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:50,400
What?

314
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:56,500
Cruel woman.

315
00:20:57,600 --> 00:20:59,000
Oh, right.

316
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,800
What are you doing in my house?

317
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,900
I prepared a surprise for you.

318
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,000
What surprise?

319
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:07,800
Follow me.

320
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,200
Come.

321
00:21:11,000 --> 00:21:12,400
Wait.

322
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,800
Close your eyes.

323
00:21:14,800 --> 00:21:16,900
- What?
- Close your eyes.

324
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,900
Close them.

325
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:24,600
- Follow me.
- I've closed them.

326
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,200
Let's go. Turn left.

327
00:21:28,500 --> 00:21:30,100
We're about 10 meters away.

328
00:21:30,100 --> 00:21:31,400
No, five meters.

329
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:32,900
Okay, okay. Stop.

330
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:35,000
- Don't open your eyes.
- I haven't.

331
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:36,800
No opening your eyes.

332
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
I haven't!

333
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:42,000
Close your eyes. Here.

334
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:48,200
I know a lot of things have gone wrong for you recently.

335
00:21:48,200 --> 00:21:51,200
I also know how important work is to you.

336
00:21:52,100 --> 00:21:55,800
At this moment, you need a chance to vent.

337
00:21:55,800 --> 00:21:57,600
What is it?

338
00:21:58,500 --> 00:22:00,300
See for yourself.

339
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:09,600
Is it pretty?

340
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:10,800
What is this?

341
00:22:10,800 --> 00:22:14,200
After all that, this is it?

342
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,500
This is called a pinata.

343
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,100
When I was studying overseas, I saw this at a friend's party.

344
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:23,600
It represents happiness and good things.

345
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,600
Take it down.

346
00:22:28,600 --> 00:22:30,000
Humor me.

347
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:32,300
Use this to hit it.

348
00:22:33,300 --> 00:22:34,600
Here.

349
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:37,400
Hold tight.

350
00:22:37,400 --> 00:22:40,800
Use this to hit its stomach

351
00:22:40,800 --> 00:22:43,700
and vent out all your negative feelings.

352
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:45,200
Try it.

353
00:22:49,800 --> 00:22:51,200
Here I go.

354
00:22:53,470 --> 00:22:54,800
Wow!

355
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:56,100
Go on.

356
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,200
♫ <i>I really want to give him a hug</i> ♫

357
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:03,100
♫ <i>And reveal my heart </i> ♫

358
00:23:03,100 --> 00:23:07,000
♫ <i>But I'm afraid of scaring him away</i> ♫

359
00:23:07,830 --> 00:23:11,970
♫ <i>I like him. I really do</i> ♫

360
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:15,490
♫ <i>Imagining myself in a wedding dress</i> ♫

361
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:21,489
♫ <i>With the bouquet from him, it must be what happiness means</i> ♫

362
00:23:22,790 --> 00:23:26,290
♫ <i>His eyes seem to speak</i> ♫

363
00:23:26,290 --> 00:23:29,970
♫ <i>They blink in front of me</i> ♫

364
00:23:29,970 --> 00:23:32,210
♫ <i>And my heart begins to flutter</i> ♫

365
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:36,300
♫ <i>But I'm too scared to tell him</i> ♫

366
00:23:37,170 --> 00:23:40,830
♫ <i>Don't say I'm making this up and being funny</i> ♫

367
00:23:40,830 --> 00:23:44,410
♫ <i>Don't say I'm crazy and losing my mind</i> ♫

368
00:23:44,410 --> 00:23:50,570
♫ <i>I think I have fallen for him, and it feels amazing</i> ♫

369
00:23:57,990 --> 00:24:01,250
You must pick up the candy and eat it.

370
00:24:01,250 --> 00:24:03,970
This is called collecting good luck.

371
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:25,170
Keep them.

372
00:24:27,130 --> 00:24:30,010
One, two...

373
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:34,290
Hold them all tight.

374
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:40,000
Now all this good luck...

375
00:24:40,970 --> 00:24:42,860
is yours.

376
00:24:46,810 --> 00:24:48,530
How does it feel?

377
00:24:48,530 --> 00:24:51,370
Pretty good.

378
00:24:51,370 --> 00:24:53,930
You should have vented sooner.

379
00:24:53,930 --> 00:24:57,270
Work is only one part of life.

380
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:01,200
So you kept following me around today was because you were afraid I would take it badly?

381
00:25:01,230 --> 00:25:02,810
Of course...

382
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,810
not.

383
00:25:05,810 --> 00:25:08,430
This is an occupational disease. Occupational disease.

384
00:25:08,990 --> 00:25:14,180
I can't control myself from wanting to serve my boss.

385
00:25:16,650 --> 00:25:18,490
Zhao Jiangyue.

386
00:25:19,490 --> 00:25:22,150
You're already at the top of...

387
00:25:22,870 --> 00:25:25,540
the pyramid in my heart.

388
00:25:56,010 --> 00:25:58,700
<i>You're already at the top of...</i>

389
00:25:59,230 --> 00:26:01,910
<i>the pyramid in my heart.</i>

390
00:26:01,910 --> 00:26:05,100
<i>For you, I'll be brave for once.</i>

391
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,020
Have some meat.

392
00:26:28,810 --> 00:26:31,370
What is it? No appetite?

393
00:26:31,370 --> 00:26:34,910
Little Aunt still got squeezed out by Song Xue.

394
00:26:35,770 --> 00:26:37,450
It's so frustrating.

395
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:41,070
Your Little Aunt is so capable, she will definitely find a solution.

396
00:26:41,070 --> 00:26:44,169
Besides, isn't Jiaxin with her?

397
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,690
Jiaxin is really loyal to Little Aunt.

398
00:26:46,690 --> 00:26:48,189
He not only declared his love,

399
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,550
he even went on suspension with her, leaving me so envious.

400
00:26:53,510 --> 00:26:56,869
Now that Little Aunt isn't here, I don't want to go to the office.

401
00:26:56,869 --> 00:26:58,930
Where do you want to go, then?

402
00:26:58,930 --> 00:27:01,250
Shall I go look for a job at your office?

403
00:27:02,950 --> 00:27:05,360
Qi Heng? Qi Heng?

404
00:27:05,930 --> 00:27:08,510
What is it? Why did you space out suddenly?

405
00:27:09,610 --> 00:27:11,480
Actually,

406
00:27:12,530 --> 00:27:14,389
my boss spoke to me today.

407
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:16,010
<i>This time for the Shenzhen Branch Office,</i>

408
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:20,209
<i>they want some help from the head office. I recommended you.</i>

409
00:27:20,209 --> 00:27:23,210
<i>Although it's not big there but the position</i>

410
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:25,530
<i>is akin to jumping three grades from here.</i>

411
00:27:25,530 --> 00:27:29,000
<i>This is a promotion opportunity that many people want.</i>

412
00:27:29,000 --> 00:27:31,400
<i>Go back and think about it.</i>

413
00:27:31,400 --> 00:27:34,170
<i>Let me know your answer on Monday.</i>

414
00:27:34,170 --> 00:27:38,690
So... you're going to Shenzhen?

415
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:44,370
I'm hesitating. I'm worried about you if I leave.

416
00:27:45,610 --> 00:27:49,850
Do you want me to go?

417
00:27:49,850 --> 00:27:51,910
It's a good thing.

418
00:27:54,770 --> 00:27:56,770
Don't cry. Why are you crying? Don't cry.

419
00:27:56,770 --> 00:27:58,850
All right, all right. I won't go, I won't go.

420
00:27:58,850 --> 00:28:01,530
I won't go, okay? Don't cry.

421
00:28:01,530 --> 00:28:04,710
But, Xiaohu, I want you to succeed.

422
00:28:04,710 --> 00:28:07,050
It's okay, there will be other opportunities.

423
00:28:07,050 --> 00:28:08,850
It's such a good opportunity,

424
00:28:08,850 --> 00:28:12,110
- I don't want you to lose it because of me.
- Okay, okay.

425
00:28:13,410 --> 00:28:16,300
- It's okay.
- I've thought it through.

426
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:19,290
- Go.
- It's fine.

427
00:28:19,290 --> 00:28:20,489
I can wait for another opportunity.

428
00:28:20,489 --> 00:28:22,970
Don't say more. If you say more, I'll change my mind.

429
00:28:22,970 --> 00:28:25,230
Don't cry, don't cry.

430
00:28:27,610 --> 00:28:32,169
Tell me your Shenzhen address, I want to pin it on my map.

431
00:28:32,810 --> 00:28:35,510
My Shenzhen address...

432
00:28:39,730 --> 00:28:45,250
- Why is it so far?
- You... Don't cry. No...

433
00:28:45,250 --> 00:28:49,709
I won't be able to eat the food you cook anymore.

434
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:52,490
It's really convenient. The flight is really fast.

435
00:28:52,490 --> 00:28:53,610
<i>No.</i>

436
00:28:53,610 --> 00:28:56,620
<i>I... I'll come back as often as I can, okay?</i>

437
00:29:03,190 --> 00:29:04,920
Sir!

438
00:29:07,370 --> 00:29:12,289
What are you doing here? You're... here for Ms. Zhao, right?

439
00:29:12,289 --> 00:29:14,070
She's not here. She's on vacation.

440
00:29:14,070 --> 00:29:16,790
I know. I'm here for you.

441
00:29:16,790 --> 00:29:18,330
For me?

442
00:29:18,330 --> 00:29:20,230
What is it?

443
00:29:20,230 --> 00:29:23,690
I'm here to say goodbye. I'll be leaving soon.

444
00:29:23,690 --> 00:29:28,209
The overseas branch office is expanding its business and they want me to go back.

445
00:29:28,209 --> 00:29:29,910
Then...

446
00:29:29,910 --> 00:29:32,170
Then, what about Ms. Zhao?

447
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:35,110
Do you really plan to give up?

448
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:39,430
We've sat down and had a talk.

449
00:29:40,010 --> 00:29:43,390
It's better for us to be friends.

450
00:29:43,390 --> 00:29:45,350
I'll wish her happiness.

451
00:29:45,350 --> 00:29:49,730
No, no. What about our alliance to pursue love?

452
00:29:49,730 --> 00:29:52,530
Are we going to disband?

453
00:29:52,530 --> 00:29:54,290
Let's do that, then.

454
00:29:54,290 --> 00:29:59,290
Sometimes letting go is also a choice for love.

455
00:30:00,250 --> 00:30:02,490
All right.

456
00:30:02,490 --> 00:30:05,650
Sir, don't be so charming. You'll charm me, too.

457
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:08,410
Since you're leaving, let's hug as a goodbye.

458
00:30:08,410 --> 00:30:10,940
- Okay.
- Sir. I will miss you.

459
00:30:16,570 --> 00:30:19,410
Sir, are you okay?

460
00:30:19,410 --> 00:30:22,810
I'm okay. Can you get up first?

461
00:30:22,810 --> 00:30:25,380
Okay, I'll get up.

462
00:30:26,490 --> 00:30:28,569
- Are you hurt?
- I... I'm fine.

463
00:30:28,569 --> 00:30:31,140
Did you get hurt?

464
00:30:32,790 --> 00:30:34,650
I think I hurt my back.

465
00:30:34,650 --> 00:30:36,810
Sir, I didn't do it on purpose.

466
00:30:36,810 --> 00:30:38,949
I'll help you up. I'll take you to the hospital.

467
00:30:38,949 --> 00:30:40,590
Thank you.

468
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:44,020
Slowly, slowly.

469
00:30:45,350 --> 00:30:46,610
Can you drive?

470
00:30:46,610 --> 00:30:48,250
Yes.

471
00:30:53,470 --> 00:30:55,090
Sir.

472
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,270
Sir, don't worry. I will quickly take you to the hospital.

473
00:31:03,390 --> 00:31:06,210
Slowly! Slowly!

474
00:31:10,090 --> 00:31:11,930
Doctor.

475
00:31:11,930 --> 00:31:13,950
What happened?

476
00:31:13,950 --> 00:31:17,889
I accidentally fell on him and I think I might have hurt his lower back.

477
00:31:17,889 --> 00:31:20,690
Hurry and take a look if there's any problem.

478
00:31:20,690 --> 00:31:23,130
Don't worry, let me see.

479
00:31:23,970 --> 00:31:26,329
- Here?
- It's very painful! Be gentle.

480
00:31:26,329 --> 00:31:29,130
It could just be a slight sprain. Don't worry.

481
00:31:29,130 --> 00:31:30,809
You can go with your boyfriend to take a scan.

482
00:31:30,809 --> 00:31:35,290
Okay. Let's go. Get up slowly.

483
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:37,010
- Is this okay?
- Okay.

484
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:39,900
Let's go. Slowly.

485
00:31:40,790 --> 00:31:42,690
Careful.

486
00:31:47,670 --> 00:31:50,070
What is all this?

487
00:31:50,070 --> 00:31:55,109
