Sir, don't you think I am quite virtuous and adorable?

00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,400
But why does Jiaxin always say that I am too self-willed?

For girls, it's easy to expose their shortcomings

But being young,

158
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,700
it's natural for you to be unruly.

159
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:08,800
After all, people who like you will tolerate you.

160
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:11,500
Why can't Jiaxin think like you?

161
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:16,500
I will use what you said to educate him one day.

00:12:21,800 --> 00:12:24,700
<i>Good luck, little girl.</i>

164
00:12:24,700 --> 00:12:26,700
<i>And good luck to myself, too.</i>

165
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:30,700
What's on your mind?

166
00:12:31,400 --> 00:12:32,500
Nothing.

167
00:12:33,400 --> 00:12:35,400
I think you're pretty cute.

168
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:36,600
I wish you success.

169
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,200
I will.

170
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:46,500
Team building is so fun.

171
00:12:46,500 --> 00:12:49,000
It would be nice if we could have more of such activities in future.

172
00:12:49,000 --> 00:12:51,900
More of it? You don't need to work?

173
00:12:53,000 --> 00:12:55,000
Zihao, pass me the coffee-tea mix.

174
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:57,500
Little rose, that one in pink.

175
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:03,400
By the way, let me share some juicy gossip with you guys.

176
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,200
- Gossip?
- What gossip?

177
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:08,100
Last night, I saw Ms. Zhao

178
00:13:08,100 --> 00:13:10,800
coming out of Gu Jiaxin's room.

179
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:12,600
- Really?
- It's true.

180
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:15,200
- When? Is it after we parted?
- Yes.

181
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:17,000
She was still tidying up her clothing when she came out.

182
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:18,200
She wasn't dressed?

183
00:13:18,200 --> 00:13:19,800
It's not that... It's not...

184
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:21,800
She was not without clothing...

185
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:26,600
I'll be there when I'm done.

186
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,100
Ms. Zhao!

187
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,600
Ms. Zhao, you were not in your room last night.

188
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:35,200
Did you go to Jiaxin's...

189
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,100
Yanran, I have something to say to you.

190
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,600
You...

191
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:50,900
What's the relationship between the two of you?

192
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:52,600
I've heard from our colleagues

193
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,600
that they saw Ms. Zhao entering your room last night.

194
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:57,000
I was drunk last night.

195
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:59,500
Ms. Zhao was just sending me back to my room. Is there any problem?

196
00:13:59,500 --> 00:14:00,800
You're lying.

197
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,100
I knocked on your door last night.

198
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:04,400
Why didn't you open the door for me?

199
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:06,000
Was she there at the time?

200
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:09,600
Yanran, don't be unreasonable.

201
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:12,200
There is nothing between me and Zhao Jiangyue.

202
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:14,600
I won't allow you to slander her like this.

203
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,500
Jiaxin,

204
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:29,200
do you only have eyes for Zhao Jiangyue now?

205
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,200
You clearly know how much I like you.

206
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:36,600
Why did you say such things to hurt me?

207
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:41,600
Yanran, I had opened up to you about my true feelings long ago.

208
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:44,000
But you carried on living in your own world

209
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,600
and do what you want to do, regardless of what other people think.

210
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:50,600
But love is not a one-sided decision.

211
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:56,000
Gu Jiaxin, I hate you!

212
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:07,700
<i>Darlings, although a love confession</i>

213
00:15:07,700 --> 00:15:09,400
<i>is the most important part of a relationship,</i>

214
00:15:09,400 --> 00:15:13,200
<i>confessing blindly will not increase your success rate.</i>

215
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:15,400
<i>A confession is a banner to declare victory.</i>

216
00:15:15,400 --> 00:15:17,000
Everything's okay between you and Li Yanran?

217
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:20,500
I just saw her sneaking into the restroom alone. She seemed to be crying.

218
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:25,800
It's fine.

219
00:15:28,100 --> 00:15:30,000
Sit farther in.

220
00:15:33,000 --> 00:15:36,200
I heard that Mr. Xu went to join our team building,

221
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:39,200
probably because of Little Aunt.

222
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:40,800
They've been going round in circles for so many years,

223
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:43,800
why can't they just confess directly?

224
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:45,800
Xu Ningyuan has confessed.

225
00:15:47,400 --> 00:15:48,800
What did you say?

226
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:50,600
He confessed,

227
00:15:50,600 --> 00:15:53,000
but Zhao Jiangyue didn't accept it.

228
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,000
Didn't accept?

229
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,600
Fortunately, she didn't accept it;

230
00:15:57,600 --> 00:15:59,800
otherwise, I would have had no chance.

231
00:16:00,700 --> 00:16:02,400
N- No. W-What are you talking about?

232
00:16:02,400 --> 00:16:05,000
Are you not her love counselor?

233
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:07,800
Are you saying that you...

234
00:16:09,200 --> 00:16:10,800
That's right.

235
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:19,700
That day when I heard Xu Ningyuan confessing to her,

236
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,500
I felt terrible.

237
00:16:23,000 --> 00:16:25,200
I don't know when it started,

238
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,300
but I seem to have fallen in love with her.

239
00:16:28,300 --> 00:16:30,600
Well, you're really something.

240
00:16:30,600 --> 00:16:32,800
As of today, I'll be shipping you two.

241
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:36,500
I support your confession. I think you have a strong ability to compete.

242
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:40,400
<i>Love Note has compiled different types</i>

243
00:16:40,400 --> 00:16:42,700
<i>of confession methods for users.</i>

244
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:45,400
<i>You can use any combination</i>

245
00:16:45,400 --> 00:16:51,000
<i>and choose the best way to make a love confession.</i>

246
00:16:51,000 --> 00:16:53,000
I think, a love confession

247
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:55,800
should never be done in a sloppy manner,

248
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,600
such as standing on the terrace and making a casual confession.

249
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,300
- I have to think about it.
- No way, Gu Jiaxin.

250
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,300
Being someone who has no lack of romantic encounters,

251
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:08,900
you don't even have any innovative plans for a love confession

252
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,200
and still have to search for ideas?

253
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:11,800
I've always been pursued.

254
00:17:11,800 --> 00:17:14,800
This is the first time I'm pursuing someone.

255
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:19,600
I have to think of something unique.

256
00:17:23,000 --> 00:17:26,200
How did you feel when Qi Heng confessed to you last time?

257
00:17:26,200 --> 00:17:30,000
It was, of course, very sweet and unforgettable.

258
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,800
That's it.

259
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,000
I have to think of something unique

260
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,100
so that Zhao Jiangyue will always remember this confession.

261
00:17:39,800 --> 00:17:42,000
What does she usually like to do?

262
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:44,600
Go for work?

263
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:47,800
Apart from work?

264
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,500
Work overtime.

265
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:55,100
Well, how do you think she could still find time to develop other hobbies?

266
00:17:58,500 --> 00:17:59,800
It's not going to be easy for you.

267
00:17:59,800 --> 00:18:01,300
I fully sympathize with you.

268
00:18:01,300 --> 00:18:02,600
But there's still time.

269
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:04,600
We can still take our time to find a solution.

270
00:18:04,600 --> 00:18:07,500
Thanks for your help last time, in bringing me and Qi Heng together.

271
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:10,000
Now that my buddy is in need, as long as you speak up,

272
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:11,900
I'll definitely help you.

273
00:18:14,400 --> 00:18:16,300
I have an idea.

274
00:18:19,800 --> 00:18:22,600
I'm too busy today to watch your live broadcast.

275
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:26,400
You are a busy person, so I'll take the initiative to look for you.

276
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:29,100
How are you doing with your relationship KPIs?

277
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:31,900
I heard that Xu Ningyuan joined you guys for team building?

278
00:18:31,900 --> 00:18:34,200
Is there any new progress?

279
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:36,200
He finally confessed to me.

280
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:38,000
Really?

281
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,700
Then did both of you have a good time together and finally get to hold hands?

282
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:44,800
Is it not enough for him to make a confession?

283
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:46,800
What are you thinking?

284
00:18:46,800 --> 00:18:49,200
I don't even know what I was thinking.

285
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:52,200
I was in a daze...

286
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:55,700
and couldn't figure out how I was feeling about him.

287
00:18:55,700 --> 00:19:00,100
My dear, you can't possibly be so romantically incompetent.

288
00:19:00,100 --> 00:19:03,400
I still need some time.

289
00:19:03,400 --> 00:19:07,600
He also told me to think about it.

290
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:10,100
You're right. The relationship has been stagnant for so long.

291
00:19:10,100 --> 00:19:12,900
It may be hard to adapt to a sudden confession.

292
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:16,000
It's actually good to give it some thought.

293
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,300
Stop talking about me. How have you been?

294
00:19:18,300 --> 00:19:20,600
I heard you have a new candidate.

295
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,200
It's not exactly a new candidate.

296
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,400
It's a friend I met by chance at the last matchmaking event.

297
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:28,000
It's a divorce lawyer named Vincent.

298
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:29,600
How is it for you?

299
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,600
He's been under my thumb the whole time.

300
00:19:31,600 --> 00:19:34,400
Our Ms. Qian is ready to start afresh.

301
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,200
Same to you. Fighting.

302
00:19:36,200 --> 00:19:37,900
Fighting.

303
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,100
<i>[Outpatient]</i>

304
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:46,700
Buddy.

305
00:19:47,900 --> 00:19:49,700
You look good.

306
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:53,500
I've something important to discuss with you.

307
00:19:58,200 --> 00:20:01,200
I'm about to confess to the girl I like.

308
00:20:02,300 --> 00:20:04,200
Can you believe it?

309
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:07,900
It's my first time pursuing a girl,

310
00:20:08,800 --> 00:20:11,000
and I'm feeling nervous.

311
00:20:13,700 --> 00:20:17,100
Buddy, let me practice with you.

312
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:18,900
Listen to this.

313
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,600
Zhao Jiangyue,

314
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:30,900
I like you.

315
00:20:38,200 --> 00:20:39,600
Jiangyue,

316
00:20:41,400 --> 00:20:42,900
I...

317
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:48,700
Jiangyue, marry me.

318
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,400
I like you.

319
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:53,400
Jiangyue,

320
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:58,300
I like you.

321
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:04,600
Zhao Jiangyue...

322
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:13,000
No, why do I feel stuck all of a sudden?

323
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:16,700
This is the one.

324
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:22,800
Your dress suits you quite well today.

325
00:21:22,800 --> 00:21:24,300
Thanks.

326
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:36,200
What a coincidence?

327
00:21:36,800 --> 00:21:39,000
You have an appointment?

328
00:21:39,000 --> 00:21:40,400
Meeting a client.

329
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:43,400
Coincidentally, I'm also here for dinner with my friend.

330
00:21:43,400 --> 00:21:45,600
This is a good place.

331

Hello, this is my business card.

332
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,400
Vincent.

333
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:53,400
How do I address you?

334
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:56,200
You can address me as your senior.

335
00:21:56,200 --> 00:21:57,600
Bye.

336
00:22:07,000 --> 00:22:08,200
Let's go in.

337
00:22:08,200 --> 00:22:10,500
My stomach feels unwell all of a sudden.

338
00:22:10,500 --> 00:22:12,500
Why don't we take a rain check?

339
00:22:12,500 --> 00:22:14,800
Well, we can arrange another day.

340
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:34,200
Hello.

341
00:22:34,200 --> 00:22:36,100

<i>You can address me as your senior.</i>

344
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,300
What happened?

345
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:30,400
How are you? Are you hurt?

346
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:31,900
No.

347
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,600
What were you doing with that?

348
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:38,400
Last time it was a blackout, this time it's a fire?

349
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:39,700
No, I just want to...

350
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:41,800
Qian Jingjing, can you stop doing that?

351
00:24:41,800 --> 00:24:43,600
Don't you even care about your life?

352
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:46,100
Then, why are you still coming to my house?

353
00:24:50,000 --> 00:24:54,000
Because I realized I still have a spare key to your house.

354
00:24:54,000 --> 00:24:55,600
Take it!

355
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,600
I really hope you can be more rational in the future,

356
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:04,700
because next time you may not have such good luck to have me around!

I've made a slide presentation for this project, which I want to show you.

375

You don't need to do a report for this project.

- Can you give me some pointers?
- Sure.

Okay, let's go. To the conference room.

Where did you get all these photos from?

383
00:28:07,400 --> 00:28:09,000
I don't have most of them anymore.

These are only part of them.

This is your first year after graduation.

00:28:18,100 --> 00:28:20,500
Getting hired was your number one priority,

387
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,400
and I got you a business suit.

388
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,800
This year, you just entered the workforce

389
00:28:34,800 --> 00:28:39,500
and just like me now, you started out in a mess,

390
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:41,600
and then you got organized.

391
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:47,900
This appointment book must be what you needed most at that time.

392
00:28:54,800 --> 00:28:58,400
This year, you just got your driver's license,

393
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:00,600
so you should practice safe driving.

401
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:49,800
This is my first confession to someone.

402
00:29:50,500 --> 00:29:54,400
In fact, on the terrace that day,

403
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:57,400
I heard Xu Ningyuan's confession to you.

404
00:29:57,400 --> 00:30:00,300
At that moment, my heart was in my throat.

405
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:02,200
I was fearful that you would accept him,

406
00:30:02,200 --> 00:30:04,300
and I was really afraid of having no chance.

407

408

My heart beats for you every single moment.

I can't accept my future without you,

00:32:22,830 --> 00:32:24,189
- How is it?
- Delicious.

- Is it good?
- I'll get this for you.

Open it.

438
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,729
The new model is very expensive. I thought I told you not to buy it?

439
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:53,879
Didn't you say your phone's battery is draining too quickly?

440
00:32:53,880 --> 00:32:55,380
So I got you a new one.

441
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:57,419
Why didn't you replace yours first?

442
00:32:57,419 --> 00:33:00,030
Look at the cracks on your phone.

443
00:33:00,030 --> 00:33:02,280
I don't need a new one.

444
00:33:02,280 --> 00:33:04,830
Well, I just want to use your current one.

Can you stop being lovey-dovey?

448
00:33:18,070 --> 00:33:20,830
Can I have some humanitarian care?

449
00:33:21,830 --> 00:33:23,159
It's okay.

450
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:25,950
Didn't you say that Little Aunt has not accepted Xu Ningyuan?

451
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:27,759
So you still stand a chance.

452
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:31,499
Jingjing also said that Little Aunt is a typical romantically incompetent patient.

453
00:33:31,499 --> 00:33:34,879
Maybe she just hasn't realized that she likes you yet.

00:33:34,879 --> 00:33:36,840
Honey, you are so right.

455

Jiaxin, you can't be too impatient.

456
00:33:39,430 --> 00:33:41,919
Think about it. From the day you met each other

457
00:33:41,920 --> 00:33:44,039
till now, it has only been a short period.

458
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:46,109
Not everyone can be like us,

No... No...

461
00:33:50,280 --> 00:33:54,219
Also, the two of you have sensitive identities at work.

462
00:33:54,219 --> 00:33:56,829
As a lady, it's natural for her to have a lot of concerns.

463
00:33:56,829 --> 00:33:59,140
You might as well come down to earth,

464
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:02,559
do something more practical, and give her more time.

465
00:34:04,160 --> 00:34:05,700
That's true.

466
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:10,529
But after doing so much, she only commented about my slide presentation.

467
00:34:10,529 --> 00:34:13,070
Maybe the confession wasn't done in the right way

468
00:34:13,070 --> 00:34:15,050
and she doesn't like it?

469
00:34:16,980 --> 00:34:18,580
Let me think it over.

470
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:21,400
You can figure it out while we eat. I'm so hungry.

471
00:34:21,500 --> 00:34:22,500
Wait for the chance.

472
00:34:23,090 --> 00:34:24,670
The chance will come.

473
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:27,320
Are you eating or not?

474
00:34:30,330 --> 00:34:32,469
Qi Heng, you don't even serve me rice now?

475
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:35,500
Sure, I'll serve you rice. Look at you.

476
00:34:37,840 --> 00:34:39,240
Relax and make yourself at home.

477
00:34:39,240 --> 00:34:40,990

00:34:45,980 --> 00:34:48,720
So tasty. Have some cauliflower.

Jiaxin, are you okay?

481
00:34:53,150 --> 00:34:55,220
He wants you to feed him as well.

<i>[Question]
What are the signs that a girl is in love with a guy?</i>

489
00:35:55,710 --> 00:35:56,899
<i>Jingjing, are you asleep?</i>

490
00:35:56,899 --> 00:35:59,839
<i>I need to talk to you. It's urgent.</i>

491
00:36:08,190 --> 00:36:11,079
So, after Xu Ningyuan's confession,

492
00:36:11,080 --> 00:36:13,360
Gu Jiaxin also declared his love for you?

493
00:36:13,360 --> 00:36:16,740
And you rejected both of them?

494
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:18,640
You're really something.

495
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:20,759
As someone who had no luck in love,

496
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:23,890
Ms. Zhao now has two suitors after her.

497
00:36:23,890 --> 00:36:26,000
What should I do now?

498
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:29,759
For these two suitors, one is sunny and handsome,

499
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:32,229
and has no other shortcomings apart from being young and fun-loving.

500
00:36:32,230 --> 00:36:33,979
The other is a domineering president and apart from him

501
00:36:33,979 --> 00:36:36,989
still keeping that special someone in his heart, he's perfect.

502
00:36:36,989 --> 00:36:39,759
Tell me. Why did you reject them both?

503
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,160
Logically speaking, the 3-month deadline is approaching

504
00:36:43,160 --> 00:36:44,839
and it's time to announce the relationship.

505
00:36:44,840 --> 00:36:48,310
Xu Ningyuan and I are the best match,

506
00:36:48,310 --> 00:36:51,429
so I should choose him without hesitation.

507
00:36:51,430 --> 00:36:52,529
But?

508
00:36:52,529 --> 00:36:55,170
But as I've told you,

509
00:36:55,170 --> 00:36:57,730
something feels wrong.

510
00:36:57,730 --> 00:36:59,990
Because of Gu Jiaxin?

511
00:37:01,460 --> 00:37:04,770
For Gu Jiaxin, he's the most unlikely match.

512
00:37:04,770 --> 00:37:06,820
But when he confessed to me,

513
00:37:06,820 --> 00:37:09,440
I could hear my heartbeat.

514
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,470
I almost accepted him.

515
00:37:11,470 --> 00:37:13,039
Then, why did you reject him?

516
00:37:13,040 --> 00:37:17,630
He told me before that a heartbeat doesn't equate to a heart flutter,

517
00:37:17,630 --> 00:37:20,400
and it could be due to an adrenaline rush.

518
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:22,850
Being young,

519
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:27,110
his liking me could be a spur of the moment.

520
00:37:27,110 --> 00:37:30,200
I don't want to fall into the hands of a little kid.

521
00:37:30,740 --> 00:37:33,050
Let me give you an idea.

522
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:36,319
Since you are hesitant between the two of them,

523
00:37:36,320 --> 00:37:40,489
don't respond to either one and enjoy the feeling of being pursued.

524
00:37:40,489 --> 00:37:41,599
What do you mean?

525
00:37:41,600 --> 00:37:45,370
You can get to know more about Xu Ningyuan and Gu Jiaxin,

526
00:37:45,370 --> 00:37:48,320
in order to find the truest feelings in your heart.

527
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:51,689
People who love you will not give up on you just because you rejected them,

528
00:37:51,689 --> 00:37:53,759
instead, they will be more proactive.

529
00:37:53,760 --> 00:37:55,359
That would make me a two-timer.

530
00:37:55,360 --> 00:37:57,999
If you enter a relationship without thinking it through,

531
00:37:57,999 --> 00:37:59,429
that would really make you a two-timer.

532
00:37:59,430 --> 00:38:04,009
The idea is to make sure you know exactly which one you want the most.

533
00:38:04,009 --> 00:38:08,939
What criteria should I use to choose between the two?

534
00:38:08,939 --> 00:38:10,460
This is simple.

535
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:15,519
Isn't there a relationship score sheet in the "Love Note" app?

536
00:38:15,519 --> 00:38:21,020
Look! You can grade them based on their actual performance.

I'm going to bed.

541
00:38:34,170 --> 00:38:36,990
Lack of sleep will cause wrinkles.

542
00:38:37,630 --> 00:38:39,220
Go to sleep.

543
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:42,500

<i>[The sunk costs of love]</i>

547
00:39:18,390 --> 00:39:20,149
Every time when Qi Heng invited me to dinner,

548
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:22,810
I couldn't help rushing to pay.

549
00:39:22,810 --> 00:39:24,229
When I received gifts from him,

550
00:39:24,230 --> 00:39:26,460
I always wanted to give him more expensive ones.

551
00:39:27,080 --> 00:39:30,339
But instead, he seemed to be under a lot of pressure.

552
00:39:30,339 --> 00:39:33,590
Could it be that I have done wrong?

553
00:39:34,180 --> 00:39:38,059
Have you forgotten what I said about the sunk costs of love?

554
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:42,729
In a relationship, the money and time invested will turn into sunk costs.

555
00:39:42,729 --> 00:39:45,209
The more people invest, the more reluctant they are to let go.

556
00:39:45,209 --> 00:39:47,919
For you, if you want to keep Qi Heng inseparable from you,

557
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:49,869
don't always think of reciprocity.

558
00:39:49,870 --> 00:39:52,229
Learn to guide him in channeling

559
00:39:52,230 --> 00:39:54,740
his investment and contribution to you appropriately.

560
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:59,439
But... But I think Qi Heng has never thought about letting go.

561
00:39:59,439 --> 00:40:01,359
We are very inseparable from each other.

562
00:40:01,360 --> 00:40:03,979
I don't think you're here for me to clear your doubts.

563
00:40:03,979 --> 00:40:06,860
You're obviously here to show how blissful you are now.

564
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,559
That's right. Love is a scale, and it only makes sense to go both ways.

565
00:40:13,560 --> 00:40:15,279
Without this premise,

566
00:40:15,280 --> 00:40:17,869
all theories will be useless.

567
00:40:17,870 --> 00:40:23,269
So, if you meet the right person, remember to seize your opportunity.
