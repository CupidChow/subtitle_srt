We don't know if she's pregnant with a boy or a girl.

- Girls can play with toy cars, too.

How about this? We'll buy different presents, and let the baby choose.

Little boy, you can't find your father?

Gorgeous lady, my daddy's missing.

Boys and girls should keep a distance. She's my girlfriend.

- This is my number.

- Thank you.
- Okay.

Exactly.

It has all the different car models and their uses. Let's buy this.

102

Uncle, I think the yellow car is good too.

103

You need to learn about the cars while playing with them.

I'll smile even in my dreams.

00:08:26,870 --> 00:08:29,400
Auntie, everything depends on fate.

131
00:08:29,400 --> 00:08:31,830
We don't want to part after we have met.

Am I right, dear wife?

133
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:37,710
Yes.

134
00:08:37,710 --> 00:08:39,700
Why don't you call me husband?

135
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:43,590
You're right, my dear husband.

136

Not a problem. Send me your address.

We'll bring you to your parents.

146

- Yes.

Thank you both so much.

151
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:26,010
We took our eyes off him for a second and he went missing.

152
00:09:26,010 --> 00:09:28,909
That's okay. As long as he's safe.

153

- You're welcome.

154

Mommy, she is this uncle's wife.

155
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:38,449
In the future, I also want a beautiful wife like her.

She's blushing. She's embarrassed.

160
00:09:49,189 --> 00:09:50,620
We'll leave first.

161

00:09:54,009 --> 00:09:56,300
- Bye.
- Bye.

164
00:09:57,910 --> 00:10:00,590
Oh, this is for him.

165
00:10:00,590 --> 00:10:03,759
Thank you. Sorry for the trouble.

166
00:10:03,759 --> 00:10:05,150
We'll go first.

167
00:10:05,150 --> 00:10:06,760
Let's go.

168
00:10:10,230 --> 00:10:15,560
Do you think our future baby will be as cute as him?

169
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:18,720
No, wait. I prefer girls.

170
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,750
Because girls can be pretty like you.

171
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:25,049
We aren't even married, and you're thinking about babies?

172
00:10:25,049 --> 00:10:26,520
Are you thinking too far ahead?

173
00:10:26,520 --> 00:10:27,739
Not at all.

174
00:10:27,740 --> 00:10:30,250
We're going to get married eventually.

175
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:34,720
People who don't have marriage as a goal are players.

176
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,649
You're not a player, are you?

177
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:40,790
What are you talking about?

178
00:10:40,790 --> 00:10:42,540
Seriously.

179
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:45,520
Have you thought about our future?

180
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:48,470
I have.

181
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:52,620
But not too much.

182
00:10:53,160 --> 00:10:56,499
In my life plan, I haven't reached that stage yet.

183
00:10:56,499 --> 00:11:00,490
I'm not sure I can be a good wife

184
00:11:00,490 --> 00:11:02,230
or a good mother.

185
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:04,530
Why do you think so?

186
00:11:04,530 --> 00:11:07,460
You'll definitely be a good wife and a good mother.

187
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,230
But no one has ever told me

188
00:11:09,230 --> 00:11:12,250
what a blissful marriage is like.

189
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:15,370
Before I'm ready,

190
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,130
I don't want to bring a new life into this world.

191
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:44,140
I think my proposal is doomed to fail.

192
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:48,310
Zhao Jiangyue has one hundred reasons against marriage.

193
00:11:48,310 --> 00:11:49,859
What should I do?

194
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:51,730
Jiaxin, don't give up.

195
00:11:51,730 --> 00:11:55,429
The Jiangyue I know is serious about you.

196
00:11:55,430 --> 00:11:57,750
Otherwise, she wouldn't be with you.

197
00:11:57,750 --> 00:11:59,340
As for marriage,

198
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:02,390
maybe she's really not ready.

199
00:12:02,390 --> 00:12:06,379
I suggest that instead of stressing yourself out

200
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:09,199
for her to accept your proposal, you should think about

201
00:12:09,199 --> 00:12:11,349
how to prove your love to her.

202
00:12:11,350 --> 00:12:14,860
Show her your love isn't periodic but forever.

203
00:12:15,620 --> 00:12:17,030
Over here, Jiangyue.

204
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:18,990
Why are you here?

205
00:12:18,990 --> 00:12:20,619
I was having my prenatal checkup nearby.

206
00:12:20,620 --> 00:12:24,619
Jiaxin told me you'd bought gifts for my baby?

207
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:27,269
You bought so many things. Even enough for my next child.

208
00:12:27,269 --> 00:12:28,789
It's my first time being a godmother.

209
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:30,710
I need to do well.

210
00:12:30,710 --> 00:12:34,429
But tonight, I promised my parents to bring Jiaxin home for dinner.

211
00:12:34,430 --> 00:12:35,939
So I can't eat with you.

212
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,939
That's okay.

213
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,950
Zhang Hao will pick me up.

214
00:12:38,950 --> 00:12:41,489
Nowadays, he monitors my meals daily.

215
00:12:41,489 --> 00:12:45,079
He insists on less oil and less salt and a healthy diet.

216
00:12:45,079 --> 00:12:47,790
He doesn't let me eat out.

217
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:50,789
We're having dinner with your parents?

218
00:12:50,790 --> 00:12:52,080
That's right.

219
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:56,170
But why didn't you tell me such an important thing?

220
00:12:56,170 --> 00:12:58,160
I'm not prepared.

221
00:12:59,180 --> 00:13:01,370
My clothes are too casual.

222
00:13:01,370 --> 00:13:03,279
I didn't buy any gifts.

223
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,719
Don't worry. You look fine.

224
00:13:05,719 --> 00:13:08,600
It's just a simple meal.

225
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:10,790
No way.

226
00:13:12,430 --> 00:13:14,669
Jingjing, help me.

227
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:17,380
What do I have to take note of?

228
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:22,659
Having a direct girl like Zhao Jiangyue as your girlfriend must be difficult for you.

229
00:13:22,659 --> 00:13:26,249
Okay. Let me teach you a thing or two.

230
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,500
Listen carefully.

231
00:13:35,510 --> 00:13:37,500
You're here.

232
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:42,599
- Mom.
- You're back. Come in.

233
00:13:42,599 --> 00:13:44,099
- Dad, Little Gu is here.
-Hi, Auntie.

234
00:13:44,099 --> 00:13:46,020
Come in.

235
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,860
Father-in-law.

236
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,090
Hi, Sir.

237
00:13:55,090 --> 00:13:56,299
Hello.

238
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,689
Auntie, I brought some gifts for you and sir.

239
00:13:58,689 --> 00:14:01,929
- Little Gu, you didn't have to bring gifts.
- It's nothing.

240
00:14:01,929 --> 00:14:05,259
- The meal is ready. Go wash your hands and prepare to eat.
- Okay.

241
00:14:05,259 --> 00:14:07,900
Let's eat. We'll talk later.

242
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:09,410
Little Gu, take a seat.

243
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:11,349
Old Zhao, come and eat.

244
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,730
- Okay, let's eat.
- Come over.

245
00:14:13,730 --> 00:14:16,239
- Auntie, I'll help you.
- No need. Sit down.

246
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:18,030
Sit down.

247
00:14:29,700 --> 00:14:31,100
Take a seat.

248
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,620
Okay.

249
00:14:42,910 --> 00:14:45,230
Sir, do you like drinking?

250
00:14:45,230 --> 00:14:46,620
I'm allergic.

251
00:14:46,620 --> 00:14:50,050
That's good. Not drinking is good for your health.

252
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:51,299
Do you smoke?

253
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,860
I've quit.

254
00:14:54,150 --> 00:14:56,140
Okay.

255
00:14:56,140 --> 00:14:59,670
Don't mind him. He's scared his daughter will leave him. He's upset.

256
00:14:59,670 --> 00:15:01,700
I didn't say that.

257
00:15:01,700 --> 00:15:03,520
Sir.

258
00:15:04,960 --> 00:15:07,110
We can finally eat.

259
00:15:07,110 --> 00:15:08,939
Try my mom's fish.

260
00:15:08,940 --> 00:15:10,700
It's delicious.

261
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:13,470
Let's eat.

262
00:15:13,470 --> 00:15:15,320
- Dig in.
- Okay.

263
00:15:15,320 --> 00:15:17,110
Try this.

264
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:26,590
Sir, you first.

265
00:15:32,430 --> 00:15:33,710
Auntie, for you.

266
00:15:33,710 --> 00:15:35,200
Thank you.

267
00:15:35,200 --> 00:15:37,060
Help yourself.

268
00:15:50,840 --> 00:15:52,149
I'm full.

269
00:15:52,150 --> 00:15:54,030
I'm so full.

270
00:15:55,380 --> 00:15:57,169
Auntie, I'll help you.

271
00:15:57,169 --> 00:15:58,749
- No need.
- It's okay.

272
00:15:58,749 --> 00:16:00,840
Sit down. Chat with my dad.

273
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,030
Okay.

274
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:03,720
Okay.

275
00:16:12,250 --> 00:16:13,549
Do you play chess?

276
00:16:13,550 --> 00:16:15,080
Do you mean...?

277
00:16:15,080 --> 00:16:18,940
Anything, international chess or Go.

278
00:16:19,620 --> 00:16:21,675
Is Gomuku counted?
<i>(Called Five in a Row, is an abstract strategy board game. It is played with Go pieces (black and white stones) on a Go board.)</i>

279
00:16:25,305 --> 00:16:26,665
Sure.

280
00:16:26,665 --> 00:16:29,844
I wanted to go on a holiday, but your dad was too busy.

281
00:16:29,845 --> 00:16:31,424
Then we got married and had you.

282
00:16:31,424 --> 00:16:33,284
My focus was on the family.

283
00:16:33,285 --> 00:16:34,934
I'm already 50.

284
00:16:34,935 --> 00:16:38,075
I need to be brave before it's too late.

285
00:16:38,075 --> 00:16:40,135
I support you.

286
00:16:40,135 --> 00:16:43,905
- Do something that makes you happy.
- It's good.

287
00:16:43,954 --> 00:16:47,175
I'm reassured by what you said.

288
00:16:47,915 --> 00:16:51,155
Mom, what do you think of Jiaxin?

289
00:16:51,155 --> 00:16:55,175
From his eyes, I can tell he's sincere towards you.

290
00:16:55,175 --> 00:16:57,524
Your dad and I had a tumultuous relationship.

291
00:16:57,525 --> 00:17:00,515
Even though we don't have a perfect marriage,

292
00:17:00,515 --> 00:17:03,585
it doesn't stop us from loving you.

293
00:17:03,585 --> 00:17:08,354
Your dad was strict with you because he wanted you

294
00:17:08,354 --> 00:17:11,095
to have a better future than others.

295
00:17:13,095 --> 00:17:16,485
We truly hope...

296
00:17:17,125 --> 00:17:19,355
that you can be happy.

297
00:17:29,715 --> 00:17:33,105
By the way, how old are you?

298
00:17:33,105 --> 00:17:34,925
I'm 23.

299
00:17:34,925 --> 00:17:37,095
23.

300
00:17:37,095 --> 00:17:38,775
What do you do?

301
00:17:38,775 --> 00:17:40,545
I'm...

302
00:17:41,365 --> 00:17:43,145
I'm working in a company.

303
00:17:43,145 --> 00:17:46,335
My side career is a race car driver.

304
00:17:47,605 --> 00:17:50,285
How much do you earn each month?

305
00:17:52,895 --> 00:17:54,935
My income...

306
00:17:56,635 --> 00:17:58,385
is passable.

307
00:18:00,905 --> 00:18:03,315
You're so young.

308
00:18:03,315 --> 00:18:08,730
Tell me. How can you ensure my daughter's happiness?

309
00:18:28,365 --> 00:18:32,475
Sir, from the day I fell in love with Jiangyue,

310
00:18:32,475 --> 00:18:34,625
I have never wavered in

311
00:18:34,625 --> 00:18:37,795
my decision to spend my life with her.

312
00:18:37,795 --> 00:18:43,365
I hope you can hand her over to me.

313
00:18:44,405 --> 00:18:46,395
I will protect her,

314
00:18:46,395 --> 00:18:49,515
take care of her, and respect her.

315
00:18:50,115 --> 00:18:56,035
I'll give her a forever happy and blissful home.

316
00:19:13,355 --> 00:19:14,795
Okay.

317
00:19:16,785 --> 00:19:19,215
I'll believe you.

318
00:19:23,305 --> 00:19:24,955
By the way,

319
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:27,255
you're not bad at chess.

320
00:19:27,255 --> 00:19:28,815
Not at all.

321
00:19:42,185 --> 00:19:44,695
What did my dad say to you?

322
00:19:45,265 --> 00:19:47,485
That's between us men.

323
00:19:47,485 --> 00:19:49,285
It's a secret.

324
00:19:50,455 --> 00:19:52,935
As if I'd care to know.

325
00:19:52,935 --> 00:19:54,935
What did he say?

326
00:19:57,755 --> 00:20:00,695
I promised him to make you happy forever.

327
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:08,200
When are you leaving?

328
00:20:08,200 --> 00:20:12,000
10 days from now.

329
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:14,000
I'm leaving once I get the visa.

330
00:20:16,800 --> 00:20:19,000
I already miss you.

331
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,700
Why don't you come with me?

332
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:23,000
That depends on your mom.

333
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,800
I think I'll come back earlier.

334
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,900
Give me a kiss.

335
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:56,500
<i>[Operation Specialist]</i>

336
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,500
<i>[Little Auntie]</i>

337
00:21:03,000 --> 00:21:05,400
- Jingjing. Little Auntie.
- Hi!

338
00:21:05,400 --> 00:21:06,400
Hi, Duoxi.

339
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,700
Long time no see. I miss you both.

340
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:10,200
<i>Long time no see.</i>

341
00:21:10,200 --> 00:21:12,200
<i>How are you in Shenzhen? Are you used to it?</i>

342
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:13,200
<i>We're good.</i>

343
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:16,800
<i>Look. Qi Heng and I rented a small studio.</i>

344
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:19,400
<i>- Qi Heng.
- Hello.</i>

345
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,500
<i>The rent is not expensive.</i>

346
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:23,000
Plus, I received interview requests from a few companies.

347
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:24,600
I should be earning money soon.

348
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,000
What about you? How's Jingjing's baby?

349
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,000
<i>The baby is so obedient, like an angel.</i>

350
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,000
<i>Considerate of her mother and doesn't fuss.</i>

351
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:33,500
We hardly gather like this.

352
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:35,200
Let's have a drink.

353
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:36,400
<i>I'll drink tea as a substitute.</i>

354
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:37,800
No problem.

355
00:21:37,800 --> 00:21:39,800
- Let's drink.
- Cheers.

356
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:44,000
Oh yes. I have a piece of good news.

357
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,800
What is it?

358
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:47,200
<i>[Marriage certificate]</i>

359
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:48,600
<i>Why didn't you tell us earlier?</i>

360
00:21:48,600 --> 00:21:51,500
Let me tell you. Zhang Hao and I officially remarried.

361
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,800
<i>Congratulations.</i>

362
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:55,000
Initially, we wanted to have a small ceremony.

363
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:58,200
But he was afraid I couldn't take it, so we decided not to.

364
00:21:58,200 --> 00:22:02,000
I actually got married twice to the man I love.

365
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:04,200
How lucky.

366
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:06,000
Your Jiaxin isn't too bad either.

367
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:07,800
<i>When is Jiaxin leaving?</i>

368
00:22:07,800 --> 00:22:10,900
<i>I heard he's going aboard for training.</i>

369
00:22:10,900 --> 00:22:13,200
He's leaving two days from now.

370
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:14,300
Two days from now?

371
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:16,200
Then you still have time to be with us?

372
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:18,600
He's having a meal with his mother.

373
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:21,700
Be honest. Can you really bear to let Jiaxin go?

374
00:22:21,700 --> 00:22:24,100
You won't see him for half a year.

375
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:26,800
I don't bear to. But what can I do?

376
00:22:26,800 --> 00:22:29,700
I promised him. I can't go back on my word.

377
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:33,700
Don't you want to trap him before he leaves?

378
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,800
You mean marriage?

379
00:22:37,800 --> 00:22:39,000
What else?

380
00:22:39,000 --> 00:22:41,800
Jiaxin is so anxious to get married.

381
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:44,800
Doesn't everyone say marriage is the grave of love?

382
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:49,200
<i>I'm afraid if we get married, it'll come true.</i>

383
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:50,500
<i>Why would it?</i>

384
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:54,200
A good relationship can withstand trials and tribulations.

385
00:22:54,200 --> 00:22:56,200
You'll fall in love over and over again.

386
00:22:56,200 --> 00:22:57,700
Be brave.

387
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:00,000
Don't overthink things.

388
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:01,800
Instead, you should take this opportunity,

389
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,200
when he's most in love with you to say yes.

390
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:09,200
If you wait till you're done considering, he might lose his passion.

391
00:23:09,200 --> 00:23:11,700
<i>That's right, Little Aunt. I agree.</i>

392
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:14,900
I think a long courtship isn't good.

393
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,000
You might as well discover some of that mystery in marriage.

394
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,900
All right. Come on.

395
00:23:22,900 --> 00:23:24,400
Come on. Let's drink.

396
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,000
Let's drink.

397
00:23:38,400 --> 00:23:39,700
Here.

398
00:23:51,500 --> 00:23:54,100
Jingjing and Zhang Hao remarried.

399
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,500
It's great, isn't it?

400
00:23:57,500 --> 00:23:59,000
Yes.

401
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:05,900
If you're willing to marry me,

402
00:24:05,900 --> 00:24:07,800
we can get married, too.

403
00:24:07,800 --> 00:24:12,700
It's just that nothing's prepared.

404
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,200
I'm afraid you'll suffer.

405
00:24:14,200 --> 00:24:16,600
I don't care about those things.

406
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,400
I'm willing to marry you.

407
00:24:19,300 --> 00:24:21,400
But I'm not willing.

408
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:24,500
Look at us. We're still squeezing in this small place.

409
00:24:24,500 --> 00:24:27,200
- I think...
- Use this.

410
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:28,800
Now.

411
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,300
Duoxi.

412
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:47,400
I've liked you for over ten years.

413
00:24:47,400 --> 00:24:49,900
I don't mind liking you for another 20 years,

414
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:54,700
30 years, 50 years, or even longer.

415
00:25:00,100 --> 00:25:03,600
Miss Zheng Duoxi, will you marry me?

416
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:08,200
For richer, for poorer,

417
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:11,500
in sickness, or in health.

418
00:25:12,300 --> 00:25:14,000
I'll love you,

419
00:25:14,800 --> 00:25:18,300
protect you, and respect you.

420
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:21,600
I, Qi Heng, will not go back on my word.

421
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:24,600
Will you marry me?

422
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:42,900
- Pinky swear.
- Pinky swear.

423
00:25:42,900 --> 00:25:45,000
- Promise.
- Promise.

424
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:46,500
You can't regret.

425
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:49,000
No regrets.

426
00:26:01,400 --> 00:26:03,000
I'm back.

427
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,700
<i>- I don't know.
- I'll teach you.</i>

428
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:24,500
<i>- This one.
- Go.</i>

429
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:26,100
<i>This one.</i>

430
00:26:26,800 --> 00:26:30,100
<i>You can't win without a kiss.</i>

431
00:27:13,000 --> 00:27:14,900
My gorgeous.

432
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:18,400
You're back.

433
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:24,100
I missed you.

434
00:27:25,400 --> 00:27:26,400
What's this?

435
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:28,000
For you.

436
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:29,700
Thank you.

437
00:27:31,000 --> 00:27:33,000
Are you proposing to me again?

438
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,600
I'm not, don't misunderstand.

439
00:27:37,400 --> 00:27:38,600
Why?

440
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,400
Afraid I'll reject you again?

441
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:43,700
No.

442
00:27:44,600 --> 00:27:47,600
Anyway, I'm used to your rejections.

443
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:50,300
I've thought about it.

444
00:27:50,300 --> 00:27:52,800
Maybe I'm too eager.

445
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:54,800
You're not ready.

446
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:58,500
But I keep giving you pressure.

447
00:27:58,500 --> 00:28:00,000
I know.

448
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:03,600
Marriage is when a woman gives her all,

449
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,200
gives her all to someone unrelated to her,

450
00:28:08,200 --> 00:28:09,700
it's a big deal.

451
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:12,200
You should consider it carefully.

452
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:16,000
I'll keep waiting for you.

453
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:17,800
Until you're ready.

454
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:24,000
You can't accept my proposal now.

455
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,100
How can I propose with just a bouquet of roses?

456
00:28:27,100 --> 00:28:29,200
I need to plan.

457
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,000
And make it a big deal. Control yourself.

458
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:35,000
Don't worry.

459
00:28:35,000 --> 00:28:36,400
I can control myself.

460
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:38,200
I know.

461
00:28:38,200 --> 00:28:40,700
You're firm.

462
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,500
Wait.

463
00:28:53,100 --> 00:28:54,900
What are you doing?

464
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,000
Buddy.

465
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:17,200
Open your eyes.

466
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:19,000
This is my girlfriend.

467
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,600
The one I've been telling you about.

468
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:22,900
How is she?

469
00:29:22,900 --> 00:29:23,900
Isn't she pretty?

470
00:29:23,900 --> 00:29:25,400
Are you envious?

471
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:28,400
You're childish.

472
00:29:28,400 --> 00:29:31,200
I promised Kang Zhe I'd bring you to visit him.

473
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:37,800
Buddy.

474
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:40,200
I'm going after our dream.

475
00:29:40,200 --> 00:29:42,600
I can't visit you often.

476
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,100
I'm leaving you to Jiangyue.

477
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:50,000
I hope you can wake up.

478
00:29:50,000 --> 00:29:53,000
And see for yourself the woman that captured my heart.

479
00:29:54,800 --> 00:29:55,800
Auntie.

480
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:57,800
Jiaxin, you're here.

481
00:29:57,800 --> 00:29:59,400
This is my girlfriend, Zhao Jiangyue.

482
00:29:59,400 --> 00:30:00,600
Hello, Auntie.

483
00:30:00,600 --> 00:30:01,900
Hello.

484
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,400
Jiaxin has good taste indeed.

485
00:30:04,400 --> 00:30:06,200
You're a good match.

486
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:09,000
Auntie, how's Kang Zhe doing recently?

487
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:10,700
After you left last time,

488
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:13,600
the doctor said Kang Zhe showed signs of waking.

489
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:16,500
However, he might need more time.

490
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:19,400
We all believe he'll wake up.

491
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:25,500
Thank you for remembering him all this time.

492
00:30:27,400 --> 00:30:31,700
Auntie, there are many miracles in this world.

493
00:30:31,700 --> 00:30:34,000
I've met my miracle.

494
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:36,600
