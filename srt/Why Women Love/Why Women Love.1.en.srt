Mr. Xu, how have you been?

156
00:11:39,410 --> 00:11:41,080
We've not met in a while.

157
00:11:43,010 --> 00:11:47,320
Mr. Xu, you're back in China?

158
00:11:47,320 --> 00:11:49,059
I didn't expect to meet you here.

159
00:11:49,060 --> 00:11:51,000
What a coincidence.

160
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:00,400
Who are you?

161
00:12:01,570 --> 00:12:04,699
- I just arrived today.
- Who let you into my office?

162
00:12:04,699 --> 00:12:06,690

163
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:08,290

164
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:09,740
It's me.

<i>- Ms. Jin.

<i>The company will be handed over to him sooner or later.</i>

172
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,889
<i>Is he willing to take over?</i>

173
00:12:31,889 --> 00:12:34,049
<i>He is young and playful.</i>

174

<i>His dad passed away years back and I didn't have much time for him.</i>

<i>I promised to fulfill a very important wish of his before he's willing to come back.</i>

<i>Jiangyue, I will hand Jiaxin over to you.</i>

<i>Why is this spoiled rich kid here already?</i>

180
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:01,960
Ms. Jin informed me that as of today,

181
00:13:01,960 --> 00:13:04,100
you will fully assist me in my work.

182
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:06,569
My assistant needs to be on call 24 hours a day.

183
00:13:06,569 --> 00:13:08,599
I'll synchronize a copy of the electronic schedule for you.

184
00:13:08,599 --> 00:13:11,450
Ms. Zhao, don't be so serious.

185
00:13:11,450 --> 00:13:13,599
I'm going back for the competition after a few months.

186
00:13:13,599 --> 00:13:16,940
I have to participate in this year's competition.

187
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,919
Since we are brought together under Ms. Jin's pressure,

188
00:13:19,919 --> 00:13:21,889
why don't we give each other a break?

189
00:13:21,889 --> 00:13:25,259
As for me, I'll help secure your position as general manager.

190
00:13:25,259 --> 00:13:27,929
As for you, you turn a blind eye

191
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:29,690
and give me back my freedom.

192
00:13:36,710 --> 00:13:39,929
I promised Ms. Jin to keep you in line,

193
00:13:39,929 --> 00:13:42,629
- and you'll take over the company in the future.
- I'm really not cut out for this.

194
00:13:42,629 --> 00:13:45,930
Whether you're cut out for this, you don't have a say.

195
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:47,569
I have the final say.

196

I... I am unruly and stubborn.

197

To tame me, you'll be the one suffering.

198
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,929
You have aroused my interest.

199
00:13:54,929 --> 00:13:57,679
Go talk to the employees in the company and those who work under me.

200
00:13:57,679 --> 00:14:01,439
They are either successful workers, or they're gone.

201
00:14:01,439 --> 00:14:03,220
I am not going to fire you.

202
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:07,190
Enjoy... my training.

203
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,880
Put that down.

204
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,240
Hand it over.

205
00:14:20,240 --> 00:14:22,860
I didn't know you had such a hobby.

206
00:14:22,860 --> 00:14:25,260
Now I see.

207
00:14:25,260 --> 00:14:27,959
- Return it to me.
- You like this type, don't you?

00:14:29,180 --> 00:14:30,750
I have it, too.

Isn't it just a washboard?

210
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,930
From your reaction,

211
00:14:47,930 --> 00:14:49,789
I can tell that you are still single.

212
00:14:49,789 --> 00:14:53,919
That Mr. Xu is definitely not going to end up with you.

213
00:14:57,390 --> 00:15:00,620
You're doomed to have a lonely life.

214
00:15:00,620 --> 00:15:03,250

Today, I would like to recommend a love artifact, Love Note.

00:15:54,450 --> 00:15:56,789
With it, it is equivalent to having

a 24-hour online Teacher Jingjing,

232

00:16:04,159 --> 00:16:07,159
that will solve all your love problems.

234
00:16:07,159 --> 00:16:11,329
Sitting next to me is the person in charge of the development of the Love Note project,

235
00:16:11,329 --> 00:16:15,275
General Manager of Link Technology, Zhao Jiangyue, Ms. Zhao.

If you have any questions, please feel free to interact with us.

237
00:16:18,254 --> 00:16:19,605
Thanks, Jingjing.

238
00:16:19,605 --> 00:16:22,764
The main business of Link Technology is our Love-Friendship Network,

239
00:16:22,764 --> 00:16:26,394
which is by far, the largest online dating platform in China.

240
00:16:26,394 --> 00:16:29,514
Being on this project for so many years, I've seen many cases of people

241
00:16:29,514 --> 00:16:32,834
who missed happiness as they do not know how to enter into a relationship.

242

Hence, we would like to help you find true love through this app.

Love Note is the first dating app in China

244
00:16:40,384 --> 00:16:42,984
that breaks the social barriers of love,

245

As for our Ms. Zhao, in order to solve the love problems

You still have the nerve to start your smooth-talking?

Judging from the current estimate, it's better than originally expected.

294
00:19:56,934 --> 00:20:00,204
- Better?
- Yes. There were three peaks in total.

295
00:20:00,204 --> 00:20:02,475
The first peak was when Qian Jingjing appeared.

296
00:20:02,475 --> 00:20:05,854
The second peak was when you told the netizens that you'd be

297
00:20:05,854 --> 00:20:07,654
in a relationship within three months.

298
00:20:07,655 --> 00:20:10,665
- The netizens are going crazy over it.
- What about the third?

299
00:20:10,665 --> 00:20:13,265
The third peak was when the power outage happened.

300
00:20:13,265 --> 00:20:14,894
Our goddess Jingjing was really amazing.

301
00:20:14,895 --> 00:20:18,574
She told the netizens that the power outage will act as suspense for everyone,

302
00:20:18,574 --> 00:20:22,304
and she wants to use Love Note to help those eager for love to get rid of darkness.

303
00:20:22,304 --> 00:20:26,814
Even though the world seems dark, as long as they use Love Note, they can walk towards the light.

304
00:20:26,814 --> 00:20:30,194
She really can make things up, turning an incident into a story.

305

- Sure.

309

Don't worry about me. It's okay. I am fine.

00:37:47,105 --> 00:37:48,684
Why are they so outstanding?

474
00:37:48,684 --> 00:37:51,755
Isn't it because they are independent?

475
00:37:52,405 --> 00:37:54,005
I've always believed in love.

476
00:37:54,005 --> 00:37:57,804
But sometimes, I feel that it's nice to remain single.

477
00:37:57,804 --> 00:38:00,265
Maybe I've gotten used to it.

478
00:38:00,265 --> 00:38:02,405
It's great to be single and eat whatever you want.

479
00:38:02,405 --> 00:38:04,924
Putting on makeup when you're in good mood, and no makeup when you're not.

480
00:38:04,924 --> 00:38:07,515
Plus, you don't have to fear being cheated by men.

481
00:38:07,515 --> 00:38:09,574
It's good to be single, but it's even better to stay single.

482
00:38:09,574 --> 00:38:13,564
It's chic and comfortable being alone. So why do you have to be in love?

483
00:38:14,355 --> 00:38:17,054
<i>Now, there's a spot available for Love Note to match you with a compatible person.</i>

484
00:38:17,054 --> 00:38:18,724
<i>- Who's interested?</i>
- Me!

485
00:38:18,724 --> 00:38:22,415
<i>- I want!</i>
- Me!

486
00:38:22,415 --> 00:38:26,004
Indeed, after being single for too long, it can get addictive.

487
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:30,134
If you can enjoy the freedom of being alone, why bother to have a relationship

488
00:38:30,134 --> 00:38:32,245
where you have to worry about gains and losses?

489
00:38:32,245 --> 00:38:34,554
I used to be a proud eligible single,

490
00:38:34,554 --> 00:38:36,684
not knowing what love was really good for.

491
00:38:36,684 --> 00:38:39,345
But, babes, please believe me.

492
00:38:39,345 --> 00:38:41,485
Life may seem short, but it consists of a long journey ahead,

493
00:38:41,485 --> 00:38:44,484
and there will always be that one person who can allow you to put your guard down

494
00:38:44,484 --> 00:38:46,594
and become the antidote to your life.

495
00:38:46,594 --> 00:38:50,395
May you move forward and become a better version of yourself.

496
00:38:50,395 --> 00:38:52,964
So, please do not give up your right to love.

497
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:58,504
