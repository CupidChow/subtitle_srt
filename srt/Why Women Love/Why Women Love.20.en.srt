[Repair of Love]</i>

26
00:02:04,510 --> 00:02:06,170
Mr. Xu, how is my mom?

27
00:02:06,170 --> 00:02:08,390
The surgery was a brilliant success.

28
00:02:08,390 --> 00:02:10,469
Your mom is now in the ward.

29
00:02:10,470 --> 00:02:14,369
The doctor said she should stay in the hospital for further observation.

30
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:18,200
Jiaxin, I must tell you

31
00:02:18,200 --> 00:02:20,519
your mom is very weak now.

32
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:22,290
You cannot irritate her.

33
00:02:22,290 --> 00:02:26,140
She can't stand that. Okay?

34
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:44,980
Jiaxin has come.

35
00:02:53,980 --> 00:02:55,620
Mom.

36
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:00,780
You're here.

37
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,829
Ms. Jin, how are you feeling?

38
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:05,570
I'm okay.

39
00:03:05,570 --> 00:03:07,730
I just need to rest for a few days.

40
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:09,260
You should have had a rest long ago.

41
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:11,940
Who can handle the intensive work every day?

42
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,580
I called you here because I've got something to discuss with you.

43
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,840
I want to talk to my son alone.

44
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:22,860
Okay.

45
00:03:49,930 --> 00:03:55,620
It is the timely rescue that has saved her from a heart attack.

46
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,190
She does need to have a good rest.

47
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,960
You are the only one who can persuade Jiaxin.

48
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,140
Please ask him to ease the burden of his mother.

49
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:17,609
Has the relationship between Jiaxin and his mom always been so stiff?

50
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:21,390
I have been working for Ms. Jin for 20 years.

51
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:25,000
I watched Jiaxin grow up.

52
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:28,480
When his father passed away,

53
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,800
he turned the thoughts and sadness for his father

54
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:35,670
into the accompanying and expectations from his mom.

55
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:42,289
Ms. Jin just suffered from the loss of her husband at that time.

56
00:04:42,289 --> 00:04:45,150
And she needed to fulfill the last wish of her husband.

57
00:04:45,150 --> 00:04:48,110
She was in charge of the company

58
00:04:48,110 --> 00:04:51,540
so she failed to spare time to accompany Jiaxin.

59
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:56,449
Then the relationship between them got stiffer because of racing.

60
00:04:56,449 --> 00:04:58,510
And it ended up like this.

61
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:10,190
You used to ask me why I focused so much on the company.

62
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:16,909
I am a domineering and unscrupulous businesswoman in your mind.

63
00:05:17,790 --> 00:05:22,140
But there is a thing that I have never told you before.

64
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:27,870
Initially, it was your dad's idea to start Link Technology.

65
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,239
He poured all his energy into the company and this is a representation of his dream.

66
00:05:31,239 --> 00:05:33,520
So after his death,

67
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,579
I decided to run the company under great pressure and fulfilled his dream.

68
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:44,919
A couple of hours ago, I was laying on the operation table.

69
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:47,710
There was a second...

70
00:05:47,710 --> 00:05:50,040
that I was so afraid that I might be not able to wake up.

71
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:52,060
But I realized...

72
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:55,680
there were only two things in my mind.

73
00:05:56,850 --> 00:05:59,370
What should I do with my son?

74
00:05:59,370 --> 00:06:01,960
What about my company?

75
00:06:01,960 --> 00:06:05,040
To be honest, it is hard to run a company.

76
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,300
There was something wrong with our cash flow because of the "Love Note" app.

77
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:13,630
People may think that the company has great capital.

78
00:06:13,630 --> 00:06:16,040
It is crisis-ridden.

79
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:18,319
I have to lay down here.

80
00:06:18,320 --> 00:06:22,989
It is hard for Ms. Jin to start a business alone with a child.

81
00:06:22,989 --> 00:06:24,430
Right.

82
00:06:24,430 --> 00:06:28,370
No one is born to be strong and unbeatable.

83
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:32,020
Ms. Jin met all kinds of difficulties

84
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:35,090
and she managed to overcome them.

85
00:06:35,099 --> 00:06:39,380
She is the only one who knows her bitterness and troubles.

86
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:45,920
Ms. Jin has strong willpower.

87
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:49,220
It feels like there is nothing that can beat her.

88
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:53,310
It was reliable to follow her.

89
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:55,920
She is my strongest backing.

90
00:06:55,920 --> 00:06:59,200
Time and tide wait for no man.

91
00:06:59,200 --> 00:07:03,500
Her illness alarms her.

92
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:07,199
She should realize that she can't take that grindingly hard work anymore.

93
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:09,780
She can't bear it.

94
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,550
She asked you to train Jiaxin

95
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:18,220
and it is a preparation for such a situation.

96
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,660
Do you think Jiaxin can take over the business now?

97
00:07:29,270 --> 00:07:35,100
Jiaxin, you are my only son and the most important person to me.

98
00:07:35,720 --> 00:07:38,210
I just want to ask...

99
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:40,780
would you take the responsibility for me?

100
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:42,910
You just had surgery.

101
00:07:42,910 --> 00:07:45,420
The most important thing for you is to rest.

102
00:07:45,420 --> 00:07:47,590
Can you leave the company alone for a while?

103
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:49,740
I know you have your dream.

104
00:07:49,740 --> 00:07:53,230
Link is also the dream of me and your dad.

105
00:07:53,230 --> 00:07:55,540
I will not ask for much.

106
00:07:55,540 --> 00:07:59,809
I just want you to take the responsibility for me temporarily.

107
00:07:59,809 --> 00:08:03,069
When I recover from this sickness, I will take over again.

108
00:08:03,069 --> 00:08:05,940
Then you can pursue your dream.

109
00:08:07,820 --> 00:08:09,500
As long as you are willing to do so,

110
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,290
Mr. Xu and I, and all the staff of the company will help you.

111
00:08:14,299 --> 00:08:18,440
Jiaxin, you are my son.

112
00:08:18,440 --> 00:08:20,790
I know you can handle it.

113
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:33,850
Okay. I will try.

114
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:39,340
But I need one person to help me.

115
00:08:40,790 --> 00:08:43,280
I want Jiangyue back.

116
00:08:43,280 --> 00:08:45,220
I need her.

117
00:08:45,220 --> 00:08:47,440
And the company needs her, too.

118
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,080
What did Ms. Jin tell you?

119
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,410
I said yes.

120
00:08:54,930 --> 00:08:56,570
What?

121
00:08:57,520 --> 00:09:03,050
I agreed to be the acting president and help her to manage the company.

122
00:09:04,780 --> 00:09:07,860
Little Jiaxin has grown up.

123
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,450
Do you think I can do it?

124
00:09:18,050 --> 00:09:19,860
I trust you.

125
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:25,670
Recently, working in the company,

126
00:09:25,670 --> 00:09:28,660
I started to realize that my mom's work was not easy.

127
00:09:29,370 --> 00:09:32,810
She is cold and competitive

128
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:35,040
because she wants to be a good leader.

129
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,800
There is no choice.

130
00:09:37,610 --> 00:09:40,350
I used to focus on my dream only.

131
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:44,639
Suddenly, I need to take on such a great responsibility.

132
00:09:50,420 --> 00:09:52,100
I need you.

133
00:09:52,100 --> 00:09:54,890
I want you to go back to the company with me.

134
00:09:54,890 --> 00:09:59,320
I can only be at ease with you by my side.

135
00:10:07,810 --> 00:10:10,060
Let's work hard together.

136
00:10:31,710 --> 00:10:35,890
I believe you all received the email which declared the appointment.

137
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:38,310
From today forwards,

138
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:44,499
I will work as the acting president temporarily and deal with the business.

139
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:48,150
I hope you will cooperate with me.

140
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,100
I heard that Ms. Jin is in the hospital.

141
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:54,440
I have no idea how she made the decision.

142
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:57,130
Was it too hasty?

143
00:10:57,130 --> 00:10:59,370
There are about ten thousand employees in the company.

144
00:10:59,370 --> 00:11:03,420
It is not easy to work as a president.

145
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,930
Are you questioning the decision of Ms. Jin?

146
00:11:05,930 --> 00:11:08,590
Everyone who works in Link knows

147
00:11:08,590 --> 00:11:12,609
Ms. Jin makes all kinds of decisions in-person big and small.

148
00:11:12,609 --> 00:11:14,740
She has made no mistakes.

149
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:18,810
Though I am her son,

150
00:11:18,810 --> 00:11:21,780
she has always cared more about the company than me.

151
00:11:21,780 --> 00:11:25,240
I even had to hide my identity

152
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:27,220
and work as a grass-roots employee.

153
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,420
Xia doesn't mean that.

154
00:11:29,420 --> 00:11:32,420
Xia, are you afraid that Jiaxin is too young

155
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:35,819
and may lack experience. If he meets some difficulties...

156
00:11:35,819 --> 00:11:39,590
Right. The company is so big

157
00:11:39,590 --> 00:11:41,420
that we have to make every decision right.

158
00:11:41,420 --> 00:11:44,590
If anything goes wrong,

159
00:11:44,590 --> 00:11:46,710
who should take the responsibility?

160
00:11:46,710 --> 00:11:48,880
You don't have to worry about that.

161
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:51,650
I specially invited Ms. Zhao to come back.

162
00:11:51,650 --> 00:11:53,370
She will work as the general manager.

163
00:11:53,370 --> 00:11:58,050
With her help, I believe I can handle all of the business.

164
00:11:58,610 --> 00:12:00,910
Is that the idea of Ms. Jin?

165
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:02,600
Yes.

166
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:05,800
Any questions?

167
00:12:06,490 --> 00:12:10,310
If not, the meeting is over.

168
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:21,710
How is it?

169
00:12:21,710 --> 00:12:23,460
Great!

170
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:27,270
Well. The office is ready.

171
00:12:27,270 --> 00:12:30,000
I need to stay to take charge of the work.

172
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,350
What's the real purpose?

173
00:12:32,350 --> 00:12:34,510
To be close with you.

174
00:12:36,280 --> 00:12:39,560
Do you need me to get you back in the office?

175
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:43,309
No. I am doing fine out here working with everyone.

176
00:12:43,309 --> 00:12:45,610
Okay. Well.

177
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:49,299
They prepared a little welcoming party for you. Let's go.

178
00:12:49,299 --> 00:12:50,319
Okay.

179
00:12:50,319 --> 00:12:51,980
Let's go.

180
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:03,840
Not appropriate.

181
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:11,589
<i>They are coming.</i>

182
00:13:11,589 --> 00:13:15,069
<i>- Welcome!</i>
- Thank you.

183
00:13:15,069 --> 00:13:18,789
Ms. Zhao, you have finally come back. We all missed you so much!

184
00:13:18,789 --> 00:13:21,219
Right! When you were not here,

185
00:13:21,219 --> 00:13:23,350
Zihao didn't get used to not having to work overtime.

186
00:13:23,350 --> 00:13:24,979
- Really?
- Yes!

187
00:13:24,979 --> 00:13:27,809
When you were not here, our enthusiasm for working decayed.

188
00:13:27,809 --> 00:13:30,539
Especially when we were working hard here

189
00:13:30,539 --> 00:13:32,710
and we still needed to see Jiaxin showing your love in Moments.

190
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:34,569
That's merciless.

191
00:13:34,569 --> 00:13:36,130
We can't call him Jiaxin anymore.

192
00:13:36,130 --> 00:13:39,810
We should call him Mr. Gu.

193
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:41,370
You can still call me Jiaxin.

194
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:45,849
- In the future, we still need to work hard together. Cheer up!
- Come on!

195
00:13:45,849 --> 00:13:47,939
- Ojay, Mr. Gu.
- Little Aunt,

196
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:51,239
Welcome back. Welcome!

197
00:13:51,239 --> 00:13:52,760
Thank you all!

198
00:13:52,760 --> 00:13:57,560
I thought I was a ruthless leader in your minds.

199
00:13:57,560 --> 00:14:02,300
Wait. It was named by Jiaxin.

200
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:04,800
Oh, really?

201
00:14:05,930 --> 00:14:07,180
Great job.

202
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:10,100
Ms. Zhao is always the best leader in our minds!

203
00:14:10,100 --> 00:14:11,780
Best Leader, come on! Please blow out the candles.

204
00:14:11,780 --> 00:14:13,710
Okay.

205
00:14:16,040 --> 00:14:19,180
Let's eat the cake.

206
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:26,350
<i>Let me take a photo.</i>

207
00:14:26,350 --> 00:14:30,600
<i>All the goods are 20% off. They are all genuine.</i>

208
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:36,350
<i>Sorry, guys.</i>

209
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:41,010
<i>I need to sacrifice you for my love.</i>

210
00:14:41,010 --> 00:14:44,650
<i>Hello. I was wondering if you can sell the bag at a lower price?</i>

211
00:14:48,470 --> 00:14:50,349
<i>If you really want to buy it,</i>

212
00:14:50,349 --> 00:14:53,870
<i>I can sell it for 500 yuan less. Free shipping.</i>

213
00:14:56,690 --> 00:14:59,849
<i>The price is so low. Is it a fake bag?</i>

214
00:14:59,849 --> 00:15:02,130
How dare you say that my bag is fake?

215
00:15:02,130 --> 00:15:03,570
<i>Are you kidding me?</i>

216
00:15:03,570 --> 00:15:06,650
<i>I bought it from the store at the original price.</i>

217
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:10,180
<i>Darling, I'm back.</i>

218
00:15:14,690 --> 00:15:16,810
Darling, you're back.

219
00:15:16,810 --> 00:15:19,580
Come on. Sit down.

220
00:15:20,370 --> 00:15:22,190
Sit down!

221
00:15:22,190 --> 00:15:24,359
I... I have prepared dinner. It's ready to eat.

222
00:15:24,359 --> 00:15:27,369
I told you we'd go out for dinner after work.

223
00:15:27,369 --> 00:15:28,900
It is good to have dinner at home.

224
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:32,690
The food outside is expensive and unsanitary. Wait for me.

225
00:15:33,810 --> 00:15:35,389
- Dinner at home?
- Right.

226
00:15:35,389 --> 00:15:36,960
Here come the dishes.

227
00:15:37,930 --> 00:15:40,400
They look great.

228
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:42,540
There is more.

229
00:15:42,540 --> 00:15:45,510
Here comes the rice.

230
00:15:48,740 --> 00:15:50,689
- Wait a second.
- What?

231
00:15:50,689 --> 00:15:52,340
I need to take a photo.

232
00:15:52,340 --> 00:15:54,349
Do you want to post it on the Microblog again?

233
00:15:54,349 --> 00:15:57,200
It is different.

234
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:59,490
What's the difference?

235
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:02,249
See. I created a new account.
<i>[Daily Sweets]</i>

236
00:16:02,249 --> 00:16:05,350
I will only record our daily life on it.

237
00:16:05,350 --> 00:16:06,760
I'm afraid that I may forget it when I get old.

238
00:16:06,760 --> 00:16:10,450
So I recorded all of our sweet memories.

239
00:16:10,450 --> 00:16:14,450
- How is it?
- Okay. It really is different.

240
00:16:14,450 --> 00:16:16,990
- Let's have dinner.
- Let's eat.

241
00:16:18,540 --> 00:16:20,540
That's good.

242
00:16:24,130 --> 00:16:25,440
He Mei, how is it going?

243
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,550
I can't stand it anymore.

244
00:16:28,550 --> 00:16:30,420
Unbelievable.

245
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:34,100
I suspect that someone may cooperate with the media

246
00:16:34,100 --> 00:16:37,450
to hype Jingjing's divorce.

247
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:39,860
And that person is around us.

248
00:16:39,860 --> 00:16:44,630
I have no evidence, but I think we should have a good investigation.

249
00:16:45,359 --> 00:16:46,359
I agree.

250
00:16:46,359 --> 00:16:49,080
<i>[Information of the crisis of Love Note's spokesman]</i>

251
00:16:56,930 --> 00:17:00,280
I do respect you and my mom.

252
00:17:00,280 --> 00:17:03,370
You deal with all kinds of business in the company.

253
00:17:04,350 --> 00:17:07,440
You just came and haven't gotten used to doing so.

254
00:17:07,440 --> 00:17:10,090
Maybe later you will be the same as me,

255
00:17:10,090 --> 00:17:12,830
falling in love with work.

256
00:17:12,830 --> 00:17:14,780
No.

257
00:17:14,780 --> 00:17:18,820
I think I would always love you more no matter what.

258
00:17:26,080 --> 00:17:30,340
Love your work and stop daydreaming.

259
00:17:34,210 --> 00:17:36,130
Jiaxin,

260
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:41,290
I have something to talk with you about.

261
00:17:41,290 --> 00:17:44,960
That's just right. You two talk first. I will go out.

262
00:17:46,490 --> 00:17:49,230
Yanran, please sit down.

263
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:55,640
What is it?

264
00:17:55,640 --> 00:18:00,020
I... want to quit.

265
00:18:04,870 --> 00:18:06,700
Why?

266
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,790
I know that you and Ms. Zhao are a couple now.

267
00:18:09,790 --> 00:18:13,369
I am happy that you both came back to the company together

268
00:18:13,369 --> 00:18:16,160
to save "Love Note."

269
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:22,460
But... I came to the company for you.

270
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:26,800
It seems there is no meaning for me to stay in the company.

271
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:31,750
Do you think the meaning of your staying was because of me?

272
00:18:32,430 --> 00:18:35,330
Jiangyue has talked to me about this.

273
00:18:35,330 --> 00:18:37,130
She was afraid that you might want to leave.

274
00:18:37,130 --> 00:18:39,410
She asked me to persuade you to stay.

275
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,230
I don't need your pity.

276
00:18:42,230 --> 00:18:44,820
Though I can't be with you,

277
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:47,490
it doesn't mean that I will be decadent.

278
00:18:47,490 --> 00:18:50,810
I will try to find my happiness.

279
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:55,100
It is not pity, but her real thoughts.

280
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,970
She really wants you to stay in the company.

281
00:18:57,970 --> 00:18:59,490
<i>She's quite capable.</i>

282
00:18:59,490 --> 00:19:02,590
<i>Though she said she came to the company for you,</i>

283
00:19:02,590 --> 00:19:05,730
<i>she managed to finish all work well.</i>

284
00:19:05,730 --> 00:19:09,769
<i>I don't want to lose such a talent because of our relationship.</i>

285
00:19:09,769 --> 00:19:13,269
She said your ability is way better than hers at the age of 22.

286
00:19:13,269 --> 00:19:16,970
As long as you pay attention to work,

287
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:19,210
you will be promising.

288
00:19:22,030 --> 00:19:24,470
Did she really say that?

289
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:32,229
Okay. For your effort of pursuing me,

290
00:19:32,229 --> 00:19:35,800
I will stay a while longer.

291
00:19:35,800 --> 00:19:39,860
Yanran, thank you.

292
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:42,580
You are a good person.

293
00:19:42,580 --> 00:19:44,270
You deserve to meet someone who loves you.

294
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:47,030
Don't praise me because you don't want me.

295
00:19:47,030 --> 00:19:50,740
Jiaxin, I wish you happiness.

296
00:19:50,740 --> 00:19:54,860
You too. I hope you can find your happiness soon.

297
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,820
Most definitely.

298
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:01,180
Did you just buy this?

299
00:20:02,250 --> 00:20:04,180
Be careful.

300
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:08,740
I did not break it.

301
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,670
Xiao Hei.

302
00:20:15,990 --> 00:20:17,840
Get out.

303
00:20:20,700 --> 00:20:22,810
My Xiao Hei.

304
00:20:34,450 --> 00:20:36,050
Ms. Zhao,

305
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:39,030
the marketing program of the app was banned by Ms. Song again.

306
00:20:39,570 --> 00:20:40,700
What's the reason?

307
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:42,759
I don't know. She just said that she did not like it.

308
00:20:42,759 --> 00:20:44,700
Did she provide any modification advice?

309
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:46,840
She urged us to get the program.

310
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:49,479
But she didn't say a word after we handed it in and acted like she had forgotten it.

311
00:20:49,479 --> 00:20:51,540
She talked about it when I asked her today.

312
00:20:51,540 --> 00:20:53,879
She banned it because she did not like it. She's wasting our time.

313
00:20:53,879 --> 00:20:57,789
Obviously, she is deliberately against our program.

314
00:20:57,789 --> 00:21:00,090
Song Xue brings her emotiosn to work,

315
00:21:00,090 --> 00:21:02,010
which makes the working environment tense.

316
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:04,180
I tend to avoid her when I see her coming.

317
00:21:04,180 --> 00:21:08,520
The PR program that I showed you last time was also banned by her.

318
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:11,700
No worries. Back to work first.

319
00:21:11,700 --> 00:21:13,590
I will talk to her.

320
00:21:23,060 --> 00:21:24,770
Come in.

321
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:30,010
Ms. Song, I heard that the new program of the app

322
00:21:30,010 --> 00:21:32,060
was banned again. What's the reason?

323
00:21:32,060 --> 00:21:34,920
I don't like it. So I asked them to prepare a new one.

324
00:21:34,920 --> 00:21:38,239
There should be a reason. They spent great effort on it.

325
00:21:38,239 --> 00:21:41,540
If it is a perfect program, I will let it pass.

326
00:21:41,540 --> 00:21:45,030
I wonde what your standard is?

327
00:21:45,030 --> 00:21:47,229
I know you bear grudges with me.

328
00:21:47,230 --> 00:21:51,679
But I don't want it to influence the work and the staff.

329
00:21:51,679 --> 00:21:53,650
It is not fair.

330
00:21:57,560 --> 00:22:01,580
You got their support with the project.

331
00:22:01,580 --> 00:22:04,060
How dare you talk about fairness with me?

332
00:22:04,060 --> 00:22:05,610
Do you think you can show off in front of me

333
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:08,540
just because you are the girlfriend of the president?

334
00:22:11,490 --> 00:22:15,230
For a higher status, you play hard.

335
00:22:15,230 --> 00:22:19,339
Not all women can do whatever they can to marry into a wealthy family.

336
00:22:19,339 --> 00:22:21,780
Marrying up is not necessarily a way to be happy.

337
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:25,410
I'm telling you men change their minds easily.

338
00:22:25,410 --> 00:22:28,970
You may be in the same situation as me soon.

339
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:31,250
You don't have to worry about my relationship.

340
00:22:31,250 --> 00:22:33,320
I only have one demand.

341
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:36,370
We should only talk about work when working.

342
00:22:36,370 --> 00:22:40,959
I hope you will not make things hard for "Love Note" or the program.

343
00:22:42,280 --> 00:22:45,060
Do you take "Love Note" as a promising project?

344
00:22:45,060 --> 00:22:50,109
Ever since the exposure of Qian Jingjing's divorce, it has become worthless.

345
00:22:50,110 --> 00:22:53,069
The reputation of Link has also been ruined.

346
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:57,420
So I suggest that you get rid of the program as soon as possible.

347
00:22:57,420 --> 00:23:01,189
"Love Note" is a heart-warming and promising program.

348
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:04,230
I won't let you ruin it easily.

349
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,620
Then try me.

350
00:23:27,180 --> 00:23:31,180
- Ms. Jin, let's eat some fruit.
- Thank you, Yanran.

351
00:23:31,180 --> 00:23:33,639
Do you feel any better now?

352
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,989
I was so worried when I heard that you had been admitted to the hospital.

353
00:23:36,989 --> 00:23:39,310
Thank you so much for your caring.

354
00:23:40,190 --> 00:23:45,290
Ms. Jin, I'm here today to tell you something.

355
00:23:45,290 --> 00:23:49,470
I'm sorry. I may not be able to be your daughter-in-law.

356
00:23:49,470 --> 00:23:53,000
But no worries. I have talked to Jiaxin about that.

357
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,700
We will still be good friends.

358
00:23:55,700 --> 00:23:58,910
Silly Girl, I know your feelings for him.

359
00:23:58,910 --> 00:24:00,430
Jiaxin doesn't deserve your love.

360
00:24:00,430 --> 00:24:03,060
No, I am the one who has given up.

361
00:24:03,060 --> 00:24:08,210
Since young, I haven't seen Jiaxin love someone so much.

362
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:12,170
When I saw his look at Zhao Jiangyue,

363
00:24:12,170 --> 00:24:15,400
I knew he'd never look at me that way.

364
00:24:16,850 --> 00:24:18,700
It's all right.

365
00:24:18,700 --> 00:24:20,890
Though I can't be your daughter-in-law,

366
00:24:20,890 --> 00:24:22,900
I can be your daughter.

367
00:24:22,900 --> 00:24:25,980
Can I call you my godmother?

368
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,009
- Good girl.
- Godmother.

369
00:24:48,740 --> 00:24:51,200
<i>[Sir]</i>

370
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:55,599
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello, Sir. Are you off work now?

371
00:24:56,460 --> 00:24:59,100
Let's have dinner together.

372
00:25:02,040 --> 00:25:04,089
<i>[Starry Jaggery]</i>

373
00:25:04,089 --> 00:25:07,590
<i>I had a hard time booking this popular restaurant.</i>

374
00:25:07,590 --> 00:25:09,160
There.

375
00:25:13,730 --> 00:25:15,770
Waiter.

376
00:25:15,770 --> 00:25:18,849
Welcome. We're holding a competition for spicy food eaters.

377
00:25:18,849 --> 00:25:21,540
As long as you can finish the spiciest noodle in our restaurant, your meal for tonight is on the house.

378
00:25:21,540 --> 00:25:24,060
You can also be on our ranking list.

<i>[Challenge the Spiciest Noodle]
[No stopping before you cry]</i>

380
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,340
Do you want to take part in this?

381
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:30,010
Sir, we'll challenge.

382
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:34,680
I'll pass. I will just order a noodle with ribs.

383
00:25:34,680 --> 00:25:36,280
- Okay.
- Thank you.

384
00:25:37,330 --> 00:25:40,100
You are so boring.

385
00:25:41,070 --> 00:25:42,539
I don't eat spicy food.

386
00:25:42,539 --> 00:25:46,129
Let's see. I will make it on my own.

387
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,430
Just you wait.

388
00:25:50,490 --> 00:25:52,589
Miss, the challenge starts.

389
00:25:52,590 --> 00:25:56,789
If you finish the noodles before the sand in the hourglass runs out, you have won.

390
00:26:05,470 --> 00:26:07,650
Forget it. It looks so spicy.

391
00:26:07,650 --> 00:26:09,470
I can do it.

392
00:26:20,800 --> 00:26:22,790
You can give up any time.

393
00:26:22,790 --> 00:26:24,650
I can do it.

394
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:33,390
I can't give up halfway.

395
00:26:33,390 --> 00:26:36,919
<i>It is the knight who protects the princess, not the prince.</i>

396
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:40,619
<i>Then I don't want to be the princess. I just want you to protect me, Jiaxin.</i>

397
00:26:40,619 --> 00:26:44,700
<i>Jiaxin, I... I like you.</i>

398
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:47,880
<i>Jiaxin and I have been engaged since we were kids.</i>

399
00:26:47,880 --> 00:26:52,319
<i>Even though you don't like me, I will only like you for the rest of my life.</i>

400
00:26:52,319 --> 00:26:56,760
<i>Can I tell the staff you are the one I like?</i>

401
00:26:56,760 --> 00:27:00,540
<i>I think that I am about to be your girlfriend.</i>

402
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:04,310
<i>I will still love you even after 100 times of breakups.</i>

403

<i>Do you only care about Zhao Jiangyue now?</i>

404
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:10,810

<i>I am making a great effort to change, but not because of you.</i>

<i>Why do you hurt me with these words?</i>

407
00:27:17,259 --> 00:27:20,470
<i>You know clearly that I like you so much.</i>

408
00:27:20,470 --> 00:27:22,190
<i>You are a good person.</i>

409
00:27:22,190 --> 00:27:24,920
<i>You deserve to meet someone who loves you.</i>

Sir.

411

You can't eat spicy food, can you?

412
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,620
Congratulation on your successes! That's the gift from us.

415

Come on.

Three, two, one. Be happy.

You can put the photo on our ranking list later.

418
00:28:29,779 --> 00:28:31,470
Okay, thank you.

419
00:28:31,470 --> 00:28:33,280
Enjoy your dinner.

Are you all right?

421
00:28:36,450 --> 00:28:41,810
I didn't expect this challenge to be so easy.

422
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:44,980
It is easy for you.

423
00:28:46,040 --> 00:28:50,449
Sorry. I can't give up once I get started.

424
00:28:52,590 --> 00:28:55,450
That's my faith.

425
00:28:58,300 --> 00:29:02,690
Did you cry because of the spicy noodle

426
00:29:02,690 --> 00:29:06,930
or you because you feel bad today?

427
00:29:07,800 --> 00:29:10,690
I told Gu Jiaxin today

428
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:13,790
I was giving up on him.

429
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:16,390
Exactly 22 years.

430
00:29:16,390 --> 00:29:19,310
He is my entire youth.

431
00:29:19,910 --> 00:29:22,200
Today,

432
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:25,850
it feels like I'm saying goodbye to my youth.

433
00:29:25,850 --> 00:29:29,220
It is good to do so.

434
00:29:29,230 --> 00:29:32,090
It means you have grown up.

435
00:29:32,090 --> 00:29:34,879
There is a rule in the world of grown-ups.

436
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:39,419
Never love someone in a way that you think is right.

437
00:29:39,419 --> 00:29:42,399
If you really love him, just give him what he wants,

438
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:45,430
which includes dignity

439
00:29:45,430 --> 00:29:47,950
and letting go.

440
00:29:47,950 --> 00:29:49,920
Letting go?

441
00:29:51,590 --> 00:29:53,579
What decent words!

442
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:55,920
But look. You appear too serious.

443
00:29:55,920 --> 00:29:58,619
I am the prettier one. Right?

444
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:06,270
Let's go. I want to put it on the top of the ranking list.

445
00:30:30,240 --> 00:30:32,840
<i>[Link Technology]</i>

446
00:31:06,060 --> 00:31:08,150
Long time no see.

447
00:31:10,540 --> 00:31:13,300
- Anna. Why are you here?
- Who is she?

448
00:31:13,300 --> 00:31:17,060
- Aren't you happy to see me?
- Yes, I am.

449
00:31:17,060 --> 00:31:19,589
But why are you here suddenly?

450
00:31:19,590 --> 00:31:23,840
- To visit you. Little Jiaxin is the president now.
- <i>Little Jiaxin?</i>

451
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,270
You are an honored guest.

452
00:31:25,270 --> 00:31:30,350
I heard you are the president of K. J. Capital China.

453
00:31:30,350 --> 00:31:32,189
I wanted to contact you.

454
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:35,629
So did I. We are so in sync.

455
00:31:36,490 --> 00:31:39,280
Who is she?

456
00:31:39,280 --> 00:31:42,199
Zhao Jiangyue, his co-worker.

457
00:31:44,610 --> 00:31:48,250
Staff in internet companies are indeed good-looking.

458
00:31:48,250 --> 00:31:50,230
Ms. Zhao, could you please bring me two cups of coffee?

459
00:31:50,230 --> 00:31:52,680
No sugar, thank you.

460
00:31:52,680 --> 00:31:54,980
Let's go. Let's talk in your office.

461
00:31:56,610 --> 00:31:58,310
- Let's go.
- Where is your office?

462
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:01,609
This way, Anna. This way. Come on, Anna.

463
00:32:08,070 --> 00:32:12,000
Did you see it? Anna looked really tough

464
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:15,800
like a commanding chairwoman and everyone should follow her lead.
<i>[Think Outside the Box]</i>

465
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:19,850
I heard she is the chairwoman of a famous international investment corporation in China.

466
00:32:19,850 --> 00:32:23,110
Right. Looks like she's really close to Mr. Gu.

467
00:32:23,110 --> 00:32:25,860
I noticed that Ms. Zhao was so angry.

468
00:32:27,630 --> 00:32:30,330
- Ms. Zhao.
- Ms. Zhao.

469
00:32:37,470 --> 00:32:40,179
As the former top fan of Gu Jiaxin,

470
00:32:40,179 --> 00:32:42,640
I must warn you.

471
00:32:42,640 --> 00:32:45,500
You should stay alert against Anna.

472
00:32:49,070 --> 00:32:51,920
She is the most competitive ex-girlfriend of Gu Jiaxin.

473
00:32:51,920 --> 00:32:54,820
She is the biggest challenge,

474
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:58,980
besides you, on my way to chase after him.

475
00:33:05,200 --> 00:33:07,020
<i>[I like my little Jiaxin the most.]</i>

476
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:14,400
Her showing up is everything but good.

477
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:30,520
Ex-girlfriend. Have a taste of plenty of sugar.

478
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:41,740
Great.

479
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:45,100
Anna, you haven't changed a bit.

480
00:33:45,100 --> 00:33:47,879
You are still so elegant and you are getting prettier.

481
00:33:47,880 --> 00:33:51,050
You have changed a lot these years.

482
00:33:53,000 --> 00:33:54,999
Doing a nice job as the president now, huh?

483
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:57,639
Still a sweet talker most importantly.

484
00:33:57,640 --> 00:34:01,029
Anna, you don't just intend to talk about the old days with me, right?

485
00:34:01,029 --> 00:34:02,610
Smart boy.

486
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:05,540
What about you?

487
00:34:06,090 --> 00:34:08,149
You said that you wanted to contact me.

488
00:34:08,150 --> 00:34:09,700
Why?

489
00:34:13,120 --> 00:34:14,770
You first.

490
00:34:15,560 --> 00:34:17,720
Smart boy.

491
00:34:17,720 --> 00:34:19,270
Answer me.

492
00:34:19,270 --> 00:34:20,910
It's not easy to be a president, right?

493
00:34:20,910 --> 00:34:23,320
There are so many things to worry about,

494
00:34:23,320 --> 00:34:27,090
especially with the current financial situation of Link.

495
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:29,200
Great pressure.

496
00:34:29,800 --> 00:34:33,179
Anna, how do you know about the financial situation of my company?

497
00:34:33,179 --> 00:34:35,640
I have my information source.

498
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:39,850
What matters is whether you need my help.

499
00:34:39,850 --> 00:34:43,049
Yes. Definitely.

500
00:34:45,360 --> 00:34:48,180
I can give you everything that you want.

501
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,870
But in exchange,

502
00:34:50,870 --> 00:34:54,560
should you give me what I want?

503
00:35:03,670 --> 00:35:04,829
- Your coffee.
- Thank you.

504
00:35:04,829 --> 00:35:06,460
Wait.

505
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:16,670
Please take it to the Financial Department.

506
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,910
Anna, have some coffee, please.

507
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:51,860
What's wrong?

508
00:35:51,860 --> 00:35:53,260
Nothing.

509
00:36:02,190 --> 00:36:03,740
Ms. Zhao.

510
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:27,430
<i>So sweet.</i>

511
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:34,189
<i>Little Jiaxin,</i>

512
00:36:34,190 --> 00:36:37,560
<i>you should think about how we should cooperate.</i>

513
00:36:40,710 --> 00:36:43,319
<i>Is he really that kind of playboy</i>

514
00:36:43,320 --> 00:36:45,120
<i>like what Song Xue said?</i>

515
00:36:45,120 --> 00:36:49,170
<i>What's the relationship between them?</i>

516
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:05,220
What happened, Ms. Zhao?

517
00:37:05,220 --> 00:37:08,300
Nothing. Nothing.

518
00:37:15,950 --> 00:37:18,040
- Ms. Song.
- Hi.

519
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:20,599
Anna, let me see you off.

520
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:23,470
Mr. Gu.

521
00:37:24,120 --> 00:37:25,189
Ms. Song?

522
00:37:25,190 --> 00:37:27,430
- This is?
- She is...

523
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:29,770
- Hi, I'm Anna.
- Hi.

524
00:37:29,770 --> 00:37:31,000
This is?

525
00:37:31,000 --> 00:37:33,090
This is Song Xue, Ms. Song.

526
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:35,559
Ms. Song is so young.

527
00:37:35,560 --> 00:37:37,960
Anna, you are so sweet.

528
00:37:38,520 --> 00:37:40,429
Nice to meet you, too.

529
00:37:40,430 --> 00:37:42,189
Do you want me to see you out for Mr. Gu?

530
00:37:42,190 --> 00:37:43,210
Okay.

531
00:37:43,230 --> 00:37:45,149
You can consider it. I await your call.

532
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:46,370
Okay.

533
00:37:46,390 --> 00:37:48,530
Ms. Song will see you out.

534
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,510
This way.

535
00:38:06,230 --> 00:38:07,810
Mr. Gu.

536
00:38:32,870 --> 00:38:34,500
What's going on?

537
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:41,799
Don't you enjoy talking with Anna?

538
00:38:41,800 --> 00:38:44,120
Why would you think of me?

539
00:38:45,430 --> 00:38:47,919
- Are you jealous?
- No.

540
00:38:50,520 --> 00:38:53,170
Are you jealous? So cute.

541
00:38:53,170 --> 00:38:54,930
I'm not.

542
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,270
I'm just...

543
00:38:58,260 --> 00:39:00,660
I'm asking about your work.

544
00:39:00,660 --> 00:39:03,080
What's the relationship between you two?

545
00:39:03,080 --> 00:39:04,850
Just work.

546
00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:08,140
She represents K. J Capital and comes for cooperation.

547
00:39:08,140 --> 00:39:09,570
But...

548
00:39:10,670 --> 00:39:13,030
you look so cute when you are jealous.

549
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:22,369
I will review my behavior. I was wrong.

550
00:39:22,369 --> 00:39:24,759
It is always my fault that you are unhappy.

551
00:39:24,760 --> 00:39:26,960
To apologize to my queen,

552
00:39:26,960 --> 00:39:29,660
let's have a great meal tonight.

553
00:39:43,120 --> 00:39:44,510
Let's go.

554
00:39:54,430 --> 00:39:56,499
We haven't come to this restaurant for a long time.

555
00:39:56,499 --> 00:39:58,460
Yes.

556
00:39:58,460 --> 00:40:00,340
Come on. Have a look.

557
00:40:00,340 --> 00:40:02,150
What would you like to have?

558
00:40:14,710 --> 00:40:17,710
Do you still remember the Heartbeat Touch Law that I taught you?

559
00:40:18,950 --> 00:40:20,410
Like that?

560
00:40:21,600 --> 00:40:23,360
You are so skilled in it now.

561
00:40:23,870 --> 00:40:25,750
Perfect learning.

562
00:40:26,320 --> 00:40:29,480
To be honest, did you do that to Xu Ningyuan?

563
00:40:29,480 --> 00:40:30,930
Forget it.

564
00:40:30,930 --> 00:40:33,799
The menu dropped to the floor when I did that.

565
00:40:33,800 --> 00:40:35,389
It was super awkward.

566
00:40:35,390 --> 00:40:37,060
Little Jiaxin?

567
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,210
Ms. Zhao?

568
00:40:39,800 --> 00:40:41,329
- Anna.
- What a coincidence!

569
00:40:41,329 --> 00:40:43,149
I didn't expect to meet you here.

570
00:40:43,149 --> 00:40:45,040
- Are you here for dinner?
- Yes.

571
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,220
Do you want me to join you?

572
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:04,580
<i>[Pareto Improvement]</i>

573
00:41:07,800 --> 00:41:09,410
Sir.

574
00:41:11,260 --> 00:41:14,110
If I like someone

575
00:41:14,110 --> 00:41:17,119
who is calm and quiet,

576
00:41:17,120 --> 00:41:19,450
would he think I am annoying

577
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:22,100
since I am so active?

578
00:41:22,100 --> 00:41:25,340
Do I need to change my way of getting along with him?

579
00:41:25,340 --> 00:41:27,170
No need to do so.

580
00:41:27,800 --> 00:41:29,840
The right way of maintaining a good relationship is

581
00:41:29,840 --> 00:41:34,360
that you two will be better than staying alone.

582
00:41:35,080 --> 00:41:36,600
What do you mean?

583
00:41:36,600 --> 00:41:40,039
There is no need to focus on superficial consistency.

584
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:43,129
As long as you feel no pressure when you are together,

585
00:41:43,129 --> 00:41:46,529
you can complement each other with your differences.

586
00:41:46,529 --> 00:41:48,500
Develop separately.

587
00:41:48,500 --> 00:41:50,890
That's what a good relationship is.

588
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:53,700
I see.

589
00:41:58,280 --> 00:41:59,780
Sir.

590
00:41:59,780 --> 00:42:01,759
Have you been enlightened?

591
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:06,999
What you just said is exactly the same as the love theory on the app.

592
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,600
What theory?

593
00:42:12,050 --> 00:42:13,559
Pareto Improvement.

594
00:42:13,560 --> 00:42:17,319
Pareto Improvement is also called Pareto Efficiency.

595
00:42:17,320 --> 00:42:20,629
It indicates a change to harm no one

596
00:42:20,630 --> 00:42:23,189
and benefit one or even both parties.

597
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:26,649
It means only when two parties can complement each other

598
00:42:26,649 --> 00:42:29,229
can the room for Pareto Improvement get bigger.

599
00:42:29,230 --> 00:42:31,469
While the relationships with superficial consistency

600
00:42:31,470 --> 00:42:33,599
may go on well in the first few years,

601
00:42:33,600 --> 00:42:35,709
they are more likely to encounter troubles

602
00:42:35,710 --> 00:42:39,370
without complementary advantages.

603
00:42:39,370 --> 00:42:42,189
Sir, you are so great.

604
00:42:42,190 --> 00:42:46,479
You can explain the complex theory clearly with only a few sentences.

605
00:42:46,479 --> 00:42:48,740
I do respect you.

606
00:42:48,740 --> 00:42:52,960
I'm not talking about theory, but my experience.

607
00:42:52,960 --> 00:42:54,950
Experience?

608
00:42:54,950 --> 00:42:57,329
Can you tell me the experience?

609
00:42:57,329 --> 00:42:59,370
I'd love to know more.
