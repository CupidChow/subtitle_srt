No, that's not true.

I mean, I idolize celebrities.

00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,759
Jiaxin, thanks.

162
00:09:38,760 --> 00:09:40,450
Jiaxin, any good news?

163
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:42,940
Ms. Zhao has just contacted an important client.

164
00:09:42,940 --> 00:09:45,130
That client is about to have in-depth cooperation with us.

165
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:46,850
I'm telling you, you'll be busy again.

166
00:09:46,850 --> 00:09:49,310
Jiaxin, thanks. Give... Give me one without sugar.

167
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,310
I know you well.

168
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:53,129
You're doing great. You're a competent assistant.

169
00:09:53,129 --> 00:09:55,440
You're getting along with us and raising up the spirits for the boss.

170
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,480
Good job.

171
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,450
Qiuqiu, what are you doing?

172
00:09:58,450 --> 00:10:00,099
- A new colleague will come here?
- Yeah.

173
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,700
I heard she was also a returnee with high marks.

174
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:06,990
Really? Who will come at this time?

175
00:10:06,990 --> 00:10:09,099
This is the basic situation of the company.

176
00:10:09,099 --> 00:10:12,139
I'm He Mei. I'm responsible for the PR department.

177
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:13,709
This is the office area.

178
00:10:13,710 --> 00:10:17,030
If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.

179
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,249
Since you're all here, let me introduce her to you.

180
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,349
This is the new colleague of our department, Li Yanran.

181
00:10:38,349 --> 00:10:39,789
- Good.
- Welcome, beautiful girl.

182
00:10:39,789 --> 00:10:41,569
- Welcome, welcome.
- Hello, everyone.

183
00:10:41,569 --> 00:10:43,380
I'm Li Yanran.

184
00:10:43,380 --> 00:10:46,190
Please give me more advice in the future.

185
00:10:46,190 --> 00:10:48,499
Yanran, you can sit here.

186
00:10:48,499 --> 00:10:52,349
- How is that?
- Good. It's the best seat.

187
00:10:54,010 --> 00:10:55,889
Jiaxin, where are you going?

188
00:10:55,889 --> 00:10:57,689
Oh, right. I forgot to introduce him.

189
00:10:57,689 --> 00:10:59,880
This is Gu Jiaxin.

190
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:01,689
He's the assistant of Ms. Zhao.

191
00:11:01,689 --> 00:11:04,059
He often treats us to coffee and snacks.

192
00:11:04,059 --> 00:11:05,810
You're just in time.

193
00:11:05,810 --> 00:11:09,350
Jiaxin, give Yanran a cup of coffee.

194
00:11:12,247 --> 00:11:14,887
Thanks, Jiaxin.

195
00:11:14,887 --> 00:11:16,419
I'm so lucky.

196
00:11:16,419 --> 00:11:21,359
Today's my first day and you treat them to coffee and celebrate for me.

197
00:11:21,359 --> 00:11:23,689
Welcome.

198
00:11:23,689 --> 00:11:27,289
Yanran, if you need anything else, you can just see me at the front desk.

199
00:11:27,289 --> 00:11:29,180
I'll go back to work

200
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:31,770
- Bye.
- Let's begin to work.
- Work earnestly.

201
00:11:31,770 --> 00:11:34,450
Follow me.

202
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:41,209
Why are you here?

203
00:11:41,209 --> 00:11:42,809
You're always avoiding me.

204
00:11:42,809 --> 00:11:44,910
Now there's nowhere for you to run.

205
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,010
Yanran, this is a company.

206
00:11:49,010 --> 00:11:51,739
- It isn't a place for you to play around.
- I don't play around.

207
00:11:51,739 --> 00:11:53,649
The person I love is in this company.

208
00:11:53,649 --> 00:11:56,270
So I got employed with my own ability.

209
00:11:56,270 --> 00:11:58,440
Then, I can see him every day.

210
00:11:58,440 --> 00:11:59,980
It's just that simple.

211
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:03,350
With your own ability?

212
00:12:03,350 --> 00:12:06,310
You worked with my mom to trick me, right?

213
00:12:06,310 --> 00:12:09,159
Would you like me to tell Ms. Jin what you just said?

214
00:12:09,159 --> 00:12:11,229
No, you can't tell her.

215
00:12:11,229 --> 00:12:12,680
Not even a word.

216
00:12:12,680 --> 00:12:17,090
Can I tell our colleagues that you're the one I love?

217
00:12:17,090 --> 00:12:21,529
Or I can tell them that your mom is the chairman of the company.

218
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:28,310
Yanran, I beg you to keep it a secret.

219
00:12:28,310 --> 00:12:30,669
Don't tell anyone about it, is that clear?

220
00:12:30,669 --> 00:12:33,060
As long as you listen to me,

221
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:34,830
I'll keep a secret.

222
00:12:34,830 --> 00:12:39,230
Otherwise, I may give away the secret.

223
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:41,499
I'm really afraid of you. What do you want?

224
00:12:41,499 --> 00:12:44,580
It's very simple. Don't avoid me in the future.

225
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:48,430
Now have lunch with me.

226
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:50,110
Take your hands off me.

227
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,630
I'm looking for you.

228
00:12:54,630 --> 00:12:56,590
Let's go and see the supplier.

229
00:12:56,590 --> 00:12:58,320
Now?

230
00:12:59,710 --> 00:13:01,469
Okay, I'll get the contract.

231
00:13:01,469 --> 00:13:03,949
- I'll wait for you in the elevator area.
- Okay.

232
00:13:03,949 --> 00:13:06,519
See? I've got work to do. It's not that I'm unwilling to have lunch with you.

233
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,350
Can we take a rain check?

234
00:13:08,350 --> 00:13:11,900
Jiaxin! Jiaxin.

235
00:13:11,900 --> 00:13:14,010
Where will we have the meeting?

236
00:13:14,010 --> 00:13:16,210
Why are you so active today?

237
00:13:16,210 --> 00:13:19,099
I should have a good attitude and be active at work.

238
00:13:19,099 --> 00:13:21,540
That is the standard for a competent employee.

239

Thanks.

Qi Heng, you know what?

244
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,889
There's a newcomer in our company.

245
00:13:37,889 --> 00:13:39,939
She's a stunning girl in name-brand clothes.

246
00:13:39,939 --> 00:13:43,049
As soon as she came to the company, she had her eye on Gu Jiaxin. She followed him all day long.

247
00:13:43,049 --> 00:13:45,479
She had her eye on Jiaxin? Who's she?

248
00:13:45,479 --> 00:13:47,990
She's Li Yanran.

- It's her.
- You know her?

250
00:13:50,479 --> 00:13:51,979
She's been chasing Jiaxin.

251
00:13:51,979 --> 00:13:54,640
Jiaxin has tried every means to avoid her.

252
00:13:54,640 --> 00:13:56,059
That's big news.

253

You should keep it a secret.

254
00:13:57,809 --> 00:13:59,300
Don't spread it.

255
00:13:59,300 --> 00:14:01,510
Don't you know me?

256
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:03,539
I won't gossip about it.

257
00:14:03,539 --> 00:14:06,249

No problem.

262

Let's pay first.

263
00:14:18,660 --> 00:14:20,719
- Let me do it.
- No, I should pay.

264
00:14:20,719 --> 00:14:22,389
- Could we stop and let me do it?
- Let me pay.
- It's my treat.

265
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:27,159
Stop it. With your boyfriend around, he must pay.

- No, he...
- Yeah, I'll pay.

Thanks.

Well, you're a regular here?

271
00:14:41,549 --> 00:14:44,450
I think you're very close to the shop owner.

272
00:14:44,450 --> 00:14:47,399
Since I moved here, I haven't gone anywhere else.

273
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,339
Because when I first came here, I thought the food here was super tasty.

274
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:52,639
The owner is also very hospitable. I can't be bothered to eat somewhere else.

275
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,370
I'm surprised that you're so faithful.

276
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:58,669
Sometimes I may be a bit stubborn.

277
00:14:58,670 --> 00:15:00,109
Whether it's food or other necessities,

278
00:15:00,109 --> 00:15:02,440
as long as I get used to them, I don't want to change them.

279
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:06,180
Then, what about people?

280
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:07,930
That applies to people as well.

281
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:11,809
You see, I like my idols.

282
00:15:11,809 --> 00:15:13,639
I once heard their song,

283
00:15:13,640 --> 00:15:16,079
then I became their die-hard fan.

284
00:15:16,080 --> 00:15:17,439
I'll never be a fan of other idols.

285
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:19,550
Your idols?

286
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:22,979
Actually, I have something in common with you.

287
00:15:22,979 --> 00:15:26,729
Once I got my eyes set on someone, it's very hard to change.

288
00:15:26,729 --> 00:15:28,519
You also idolize celebrities?

289
00:15:28,519 --> 00:15:30,980
Why didn't you tell me early? Who do you idolize?

290
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:32,310
I...

291
00:15:32,310 --> 00:15:36,409
If there's an opportunity later, you will get to know it.

292

00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:30,134
But for patients like him

322
00:19:30,135 --> 00:19:33,134
who completely came to from a deep sleep,

323
00:19:33,135 --> 00:19:35,205
our hospital had three precedents.

324
00:19:35,205 --> 00:19:37,785
I believe he will be the fourth one.

325
00:19:37,785 --> 00:19:40,134
Wonderful. Thank you, doctor.

326
00:19:40,134 --> 00:19:42,935
What should we usually do?

327
00:19:42,935 --> 00:19:46,744
The family of the patient needs to meet him more and talk to him more,

328
00:19:46,744 --> 00:19:49,464
which can stimulate his auditory nerve.

329
00:19:49,464 --> 00:19:51,954
This period of time is the critical period of his recovery.

330
00:19:51,954 --> 00:19:54,464
- I hope you pay more attention to it.
- Okay. We'll come here when we're free.

331
00:19:54,464 --> 00:19:55,975
Okay.

332
00:19:57,885 --> 00:20:01,005
Jiaxin, thanks.

333
00:20:01,005 --> 00:20:04,324
Madam, he's my best friend.

334
00:20:04,324 --> 00:20:07,354
If I were unconscious, he would definitely do the same thing.

335
00:20:07,354 --> 00:20:08,714
Don't worry.

336
00:20:08,714 --> 00:20:10,605
He will surely recover.

337
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:15,705
Thanks. Thanks.

338
00:20:23,135 --> 00:20:27,055
Hey, you came back from the dead today.

339
00:20:28,065 --> 00:20:29,545
You sleep well,

340
00:20:29,545 --> 00:20:31,685
while your mom and I are scared out of our wits.

341
00:20:33,135 --> 00:20:35,175
Luckily, the surgery went smoothly.

342
00:20:37,025 --> 00:20:39,965
Otherwise, I really couldn't forgive myself.

343
00:20:43,645 --> 00:20:45,965
You can hear me, right?

344
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:48,875
Don't worry.

345
00:20:48,875 --> 00:20:50,905
You will surely recover.

346
00:20:53,785 --> 00:20:57,905
Recently, many things have happened to me.

347
00:21:00,025 --> 00:21:02,395
I'm even not the same as I was.

348
00:21:08,615 --> 00:21:12,005
That she-devil really makes me confused.

349
00:21:13,795 --> 00:21:16,064
I promised to help her chase Xu Ningyuan.

350
00:21:16,065 --> 00:21:19,205
But I felt a little sad when I saw them dating.

351
00:21:21,645 --> 00:21:23,615
Am I insane?

352

00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:51,925
Boss, I heard you needed me.

355

Do well in the afternoon. Don't make silly mistakes.

Why do you look at me like that?

358
00:22:05,935 --> 00:22:10,115
Sure enough, you dress differently when you meet Mr. Xu.

359
00:22:10,115 --> 00:22:12,824
- Really?
- Yeah.

360
00:22:14,785 --> 00:22:16,865
The clothes must be new.

361
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:32,765
And you also changed the color of your lipstick.

362

It's much better.

363
00:23:04,855 --> 00:23:06,085
How about me teaching you a few more tactics?

364
00:23:06,085 --> 00:23:09,295
I'll work in the afternoon, not date Mr. Xu.

365

You'd better keep your bad tactics to deceive young girls.

They aren't suitable for me.

Li Yanran? What for?

375
00:23:33,185 --> 00:23:35,585
She's a newcomer. Ms. Jin specially told me

376

384

Enough.

385
00:24:40,215 --> 00:24:43,975
You're working at your boyfriend's workplace?

386
00:24:43,975 --> 00:24:45,985
It's a secret.

387
00:24:45,985 --> 00:24:48,424
In order to chase my boyfriend,

388
00:24:48,424 --> 00:24:50,454
I can only get closer to him.

389
00:24:50,454 --> 00:24:53,155
Then, it will be more convenient to create opportunities.

390
00:24:53,155 --> 00:24:55,454
Isn't he your boyfriend?

391
00:24:55,455 --> 00:24:57,305
Why do you still need to chase him?

392
00:24:57,305 --> 00:24:59,125
Yeah.

393
00:24:59,125 --> 00:25:02,255
That I admit he's my boyfriend is not enough.

394
00:25:02,255 --> 00:25:04,875
He needs to admit he's my boyfriend, too.

395
00:25:04,875 --> 00:25:08,225
So he isn't your boyfriend?

396
00:25:09,305 --> 00:25:13,125
By the way, what are you doing here?

397
00:25:13,125 --> 00:25:16,064
You're the client who used our app, right?

398

How do you feel about our app?

399
00:25:20,305 --> 00:25:24,124
You know what? Now we have a new brand ambassador called Qian Jingjing.

400
00:25:24,124 --> 00:25:27,424
She's the person I worship. Do you know her?

401
00:25:29,185 --> 00:25:31,455
Zihao said Li Yanran had arrived at the meeting room.

402
00:25:31,455 --> 00:25:33,645
Mr. Xu seems to have arrived there, too.

Sir, what music do you like to listen to?

404
00:25:36,735 --> 00:25:41,374
I'm telling you. My boyfriend's favorite music is songs by The Beatles.

Okay. Let's get started. Our company's "Love Note" project

00:27:00,014 --> 00:27:03,854
is an additional product developed through the big data of the Love-Friendship Network.

Its main function is love, social contact, and teaching.
<i>[Main Function, Target Audience]</i>

416
00:27:07,904 --> 00:27:13,684
The portraits of the target audience are mainly about women in their 20s and 30s that are of marriageable age.

417
00:27:14,615 --> 00:27:18,924
According to our data, in the first- and second-tier cities of our country,

418
00:27:18,924 --> 00:27:21,935
the percentage of single women has increased year by year,

419
00:27:21,935 --> 00:27:26,175
from 18% to 20%, then from 24% to 29%.

420
00:27:26,175 --> 00:27:30,164
Most of them aren't necessarily people who want to be single.

But young people should work hard and not make things up.

442
00:29:11,914 --> 00:29:17,794
I'm telling you. Men must make the first move when pursuing a female manager who is poker-faced like Ms. Zhao.

443
00:29:17,794 --> 00:29:22,114
Otherwise, you'll probably end up missing the opportunity of getting married.

483
00:32:04,615 --> 00:32:07,255
- Is it delicious or not? Does it taste good?
-Yes.

484
00:32:07,255 --> 00:32:10,544

487
00:32:45,025 --> 00:32:46,405
Waitress, could I have the check?

488
00:32:46,405 --> 00:32:48,234
This store's dishes are a bit common.

489
00:32:48,235 --> 00:32:49,834
Next time, how about me booking the table?

490
00:32:49,835 --> 00:32:52,775
It's all right. We're just grabbing a bite anyway.

Yes.

492
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:03,145
I can't have a teleconference now. My things are all in the office.

Okay. I'll tell you after I go back.

494

You still have work?

495
00:33:07,655 --> 00:33:10,585
I'll have a teleconference. I'll drive you home first.

496
00:33:10,585 --> 00:33:13,004
It's okay. I live nearby. I can walk home.

497
00:33:13,025 --> 00:33:15,594

- Yes.

498

- Bye-bye.

Your cola.

501
00:33:47,595 --> 00:33:49,114
Honey, what would you like?

502
00:33:49,115 --> 00:33:51,264
Would you like a couple's combo or a single's combo?

503
00:33:51,265 --> 00:33:53,514
- Single.
- Okay.

504
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:58,555

I didn't expect that you would see literary films.

It's not what a successful woman would do.

I'm a 30-year-old single woman.

Literary films suit me well.

534
00:36:30,705 --> 00:36:35,705
Anyway, I don't think so. You should see films about history and tactics.

What about you?

536
00:36:37,265 --> 00:36:41,575
Do the youth of your age like to see those

537
00:36:41,575 --> 00:36:44,905
adventure films, like Fast & Furious?

<i>[How to turn the Prince Charming you have a crush on into your boyfriend?]</i>

568
00:39:40,920 --> 00:39:44,465
How do I feel when I have a crush on someone?

569
00:39:44,465 --> 00:39:48,095
It's like I don't want him to find out about it,

570
00:39:48,095 --> 00:39:50,225
but at the same time, I want him to know.

571
00:39:50,225 --> 00:39:54,195
I'm most afraid of him pretending not to know anything.

572
00:39:55,490 --> 00:39:57,125
It's terrible.

573
00:39:57,125 --> 00:39:59,574
Silly girl, don't worry about that.

574
00:39:59,574 --> 00:40:01,295
Open Love Note.

575
00:40:01,295 --> 00:40:04,594
You can learn how to turn the Prince Charming you have a crush on into your boyfriend.

576
00:40:04,595 --> 00:40:06,115
Really?

577
00:40:06,115 --> 00:40:09,575
First, increase the frequency of showing up beside him.

578
00:40:09,575 --> 00:40:11,604
Let him know that you're around him every now and then.

579
00:40:11,604 --> 00:40:15,225
Then, create some troubles occasionally and ask him to help you.

580
00:40:15,225 --> 00:40:18,094
Let him feel that you need him very much.

581
00:40:18,094 --> 00:40:22,844
Besides, talk to him more and ask him questions.

582
00:40:22,844 --> 00:40:24,984
For example, if he likes coffee,

583
00:40:24,985 --> 00:40:27,744
you can ask him how to tell the quality of coffee.

584
00:40:27,745 --> 00:40:31,265
If he likes basketball, you can ask which basketball star he likes.

585
00:40:31,265 --> 00:40:33,915
What if...

586
00:40:33,915 --> 00:40:35,744
he isn't even my WeChat friend?

587
00:40:35,745 --> 00:40:37,394
Then add him on WeChat.

588
00:40:37,395 --> 00:40:41,945
As long as he doesn't have a girlfriend or doesn't like you at all,

589
00:40:41,945 --> 00:40:43,495
he will accept your friend request in general.

590
00:40:43,495 --> 00:40:45,205
