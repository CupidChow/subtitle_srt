00:11:14,360 --> 00:11:15,539
Could you stop it?

160
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:23,210
- Be with her.
- Be with her.

161
00:11:23,210 --> 00:11:27,250
What are you doing here? Have you finished your work?

162
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:34,620
Yanran, your idea of confessing your love is good,

163
00:11:34,620 --> 00:11:37,870
but you shouldn't affect others in the workplace.

164
00:11:38,680 --> 00:11:42,440
Someone only thinks about work and data.

165
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,960
She dislikes that others are in love.

166
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:00,580
It seems that you really hurt Gu Jiaxin.

167
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:04,220
In my opinion, you should apologize to him.

168
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:06,520
Forget it.

169
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,760
Why didn't you pick up the call?

170
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:15,339
You two are at odds, too?

171
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:17,299
I've been under a bit of pressure at work recently.

172
00:12:17,300 --> 00:12:19,120
I just complained to Qi Heng slightly.

173
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,899
I just wanted him to comfort me.

174
00:12:20,900 --> 00:12:22,899
To my surprise, he wasn't on my side.

175
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:25,639
Besides, he lectured me. So I had a quarrel with him.

176
00:12:25,639 --> 00:12:28,039
Then, I got angry and told him that I wanted to break up with him.

177
00:12:28,039 --> 00:12:30,740
Now I kind of regret it.

178
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:33,420
But I can't apologize to him.

179
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:35,019
It's really difficult to be in love with someone.

180
00:12:35,020 --> 00:12:38,060
I feel I'm making things difficult for myself.

181
00:12:38,060 --> 00:12:40,700
Why do I have friends like you two?

182
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,259
You're both silly.

183
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,700
Listen carefully when I give a lecture later. Then, your problems will be solved.

184
00:12:45,700 --> 00:12:47,210
Really?

185
00:12:50,920 --> 00:12:52,740
<i>[Breakup Museum]</i>

186
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:55,400
<i>Please take a look.</i>

187
00:12:56,040 --> 00:12:57,940
<i>Hello, have a look.</i>

188
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:00,000
<i>Hello, have a look.</i>

<i>Okay. Thanks.</i>

<i>[Breakup Museum]</i>

191
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,000
Hello, everyone.

192
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:22,940
The theme of our event today is "Breakup."

193
00:13:22,940 --> 00:13:25,760
Why is a breakup so painful?

194
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,059
Because you've been used to your love staying by your side.

195
00:13:29,059 --> 00:13:33,059
When your love suddenly leaves you, your life will become empty.

196
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:36,019
Only when we know about the pain of a breakup

197
00:13:36,020 --> 00:13:39,099
can we tell ourselves what we should do next.

198
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:43,799
Should you break up with your love happily or reconcile with your true love?

199
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:49,379
First, we should determine whether your breakup is a false breakup or a true breakup?

200
00:13:49,379 --> 00:13:54,340
False breakup usually happens when men and women are still dating or have been married,

201
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:59,339
or when couples have a quarrel or misunderstand each other when they can't control their emotions.

202
00:13:59,339 --> 00:14:03,219
But actually, the two are still eager to meet again.

203
00:14:03,219 --> 00:14:07,359
False breakup shows that you can still do something about your relationship.

204
00:14:07,359 --> 00:14:10,419
What would happen if you didn't reconcile with your love in time?

205
00:14:10,420 --> 00:14:12,739
It's like pseudomyopia and true myopia.

206
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:16,239
When you have a problem in your relationship, you should talk to each other and solve it in time.

207
00:14:16,239 --> 00:14:21,799
Otherwise, things will get worse and the best time to improve the relationship will slowly run out.

208
00:14:21,799 --> 00:14:24,320
Then, a false breakup will become a true breakup.

209
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,399
Ms. Jingjing, how can you improve the relationship after a false breakup?

210
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:29,760
Have you ever had a false breakup?

211
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,019
Next, let me share a story of mine with you guys.

212
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:36,499
When Zhang Hao and I just confirmed our relationship,

213
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:39,220
he was busy with starting his own business.

214
00:14:39,220 --> 00:14:40,520
That day was my birthday.

215
00:14:40,520 --> 00:14:42,860
He was busy with his work and didn't have time for me.

216
00:14:42,860 --> 00:14:45,740
I was angry and broke up with him.

217
00:14:45,740 --> 00:14:48,780
I ran away from home with some luggage.

218
00:14:48,780 --> 00:14:51,519
He kept calling me. I didn't take his calls.

219
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,620
- But actually, I really wanted him to look for me.
<i>- Jingjing.</i>

220
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:57,960
<i>Jingjing. Jingjing,</i>

221
00:14:58,860 --> 00:15:01,559
<i>it's very dangerous for you to stay outside at this late hour.</i>

222
00:15:01,559 --> 00:15:03,700
<i>Moreover, it's very cold.</i>

223
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:05,200
<i>Hurry up.</i>

224
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:07,260
<i>Put it on.</i>

225
00:15:07,260 --> 00:15:08,860
<i>You must be freezing.</i>

226
00:15:08,860 --> 00:15:11,280
<i>I'd rather freeze to death. You don't care about me anyway.</i>

227
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:15,159
<i>But I swear that this will never happen again in the future.</i>

228
00:15:15,159 --> 00:15:16,739
<i>You're everything to me.</i>

229
00:15:16,740 --> 00:15:18,939
<i>But my birthday will almost be over.</i>

230
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:21,120
<i>Now, it's just 10:00 p.m.</i>

231
00:15:22,220 --> 00:15:24,139
<i>How about me taking you to Chongming Mountain?</i>

232
00:15:24,140 --> 00:15:26,000
<i>Let's go see the night view.</i>

233
00:15:27,620 --> 00:15:31,040
<i>- Okay.
- Don't be angry again.</i>

234
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:32,480
<i>Okay.</i>

235
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,300
<i>Okay. Let's go.</i>

236
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,800
<i>Oh, right!</i>

237
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,299
<i>You haven't had anything to eat since you worked overtime, right?</i>

238
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:42,140
<i>I bought your favorite egg tarts.</i>

239
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,840
<i>Thanks, Honey.</i>

240
00:15:47,660 --> 00:15:51,599
True love is that even if you and your love have a quarrel, you will still miss your love.

241
00:15:51,599 --> 00:15:54,700
<i>- Yeah.
- That's true.</i>

242
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,640
So a false breakup isn't scary.

243
00:15:57,640 --> 00:16:00,619
Now I'll give you a few tips.

244
00:16:00,620 --> 00:16:03,579
First, accept the false breakup.

245
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:07,019
Don't ask, "Why?" to avoid a worse relationship.

246
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,920
Besides, talk to each other.

247
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:11,680
If not, you will get more and more down.

248
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:13,560
Your relationship will reach the breaking point.

249
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:16,860
Finally, find your problems and admit mistakes.

250
00:16:16,860 --> 00:16:19,819
Nothing is more comforting

251
00:16:19,820 --> 00:16:23,599
than admitting your mistakes and giving the other person a warm hug.

252
00:16:24,920 --> 00:16:28,500
<i>[Qi Heng]
Come and pick me up tonight.</i>

253
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,800
<i>Why should I mind the relationship score sheet?</i>

254
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:35,040
<i>I knew she was romantically incompetent long ago.</i>

255
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,080
<i>It's not that hard to say sorry.</i>

256
00:16:38,080 --> 00:16:40,080
<i>After all, I did wrong.</i>

257
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:42,859
Okay. That's all for today's lecture.

258

- Nice.</i>

259
00:16:47,660 --> 00:16:49,160
<i>Let's go.</i>

260
00:17:16,060 --> 00:17:18,159
- Be careful.
- Be careful.

261
00:17:18,159 --> 00:17:19,400
Do it slowly.

262
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:21,279
- Be careful.
- Okay.

263
00:17:23,840 --> 00:17:25,920
Everyone, come here.

264
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:30,639
You guys have worked very hard today, so you can take tomorrow morning off.

265

Get some rest at home.

266

Thanks, Ms. Zhao.

267
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:35,899
Go back to work.

268
00:17:35,900 --> 00:17:37,600
- Okay.
- Okay.

269
00:17:42,300 --> 00:17:44,480
Ms. Zhao, there's something wrong with the products.

270
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,320
Please come with me.

- I...
- The colleagues of the PR department should assemble at the company tonight.

273
00:17:56,259 --> 00:17:59,699
- Ms. Mei is asking for you.
- Monitor the number of the visitors for today's event and wrap it up.

274
00:17:59,699 --> 00:18:00,979
I'll come to you later.

275
00:18:00,980 --> 00:18:02,360

What about you?

00:18:32,140 --> 00:18:34,300
My boyfriend will probably come and fetch me.

That's so sweet.

That Mr. Qi.

He's your boyfriend, right? He looks good.

291
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:44,699
He looks like a frugal person.

292
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:47,020
Mr. Qi is here.

293
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,120
- Hi.
- Hello.

294
00:18:50,120 --> 00:18:51,760
Hi, Mr. Qi.

295
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,379
- Zihao, our taxi is here.
- Bye.

296
00:18:53,379 --> 00:18:54,739
- Bye.
- Duoxi, we have to go.

297
00:18:54,739 --> 00:18:56,260
Bye.

298
00:18:59,580 --> 00:19:03,799
Well, I bought you your favorite cake and KellyOne.

299
00:19:03,799 --> 00:19:05,480
Thanks.

300
00:19:06,080 --> 00:19:08,080
It was my fault in that matter.

301
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,939
When you were unhappy and complained to me,

302
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:14,259
I should have cared about you and shouldn't have lectured you.

303
00:19:14,259 --> 00:19:15,960
I was too straightforward.

304
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:18,100
I'll gradually fix my mistakes. Is that okay?

305
00:19:19,580 --> 00:19:21,160
Don't be angry.

306
00:19:21,160 --> 00:19:23,480
I only want a kiss.

307
00:19:26,260 --> 00:19:28,099
Actually, I'd stopped being angry for a while now.

308
00:19:28,100 --> 00:19:30,179
I think I did wrong, too.

309
00:19:30,180 --> 00:19:32,640
I shouldn't have lost my temper.

310
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:35,540
You're so cute.

311
00:19:37,480 --> 00:19:40,900
You didn't come here by bicycle, did you?

312
00:19:42,100 --> 00:19:43,460
You suddenly asked me to pick you up.

313
00:19:43,460 --> 00:19:45,640
I worried that I might be stuck in traffic, so I rode a bicycle to come here.

314
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,080
Did you come all the way here by bicycle?

315
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:50,699
I just wanted to find an excuse. I don't want to be on the outs with you again.

316
00:19:50,699 --> 00:19:53,659

Before the meeting begins, I'd like to tell you something.

377
00:25:04,599 --> 00:25:07,060
This is my son, Gu Jiaxin.

He's an assistant in the Project Department.

I'm introducing him to you guys not to ask you to give him preferential treatment.

On the contrary, I would prefer you to supervise his work

381
00:25:16,259 --> 00:25:20,120
and manage him seriously on behalf of me.

382
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,700
Now, let's start the meeting.

383
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:28,219
Jiaxin, you can tell them about your proposal.

384
00:25:28,220 --> 00:25:29,780
Okay.

385
00:25:31,280 --> 00:25:32,980
Okay. Let's get started.

386
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:35,899
Our "Love Note" app will hold all kinds
<i>[Love Market]</i>

387
00:25:35,899 --> 00:25:39,619
of activities every now and then to interact with our fans.
<i>[Love Market]</i>

388
00:25:39,619 --> 00:25:43,679
But every time, they are held in the form of lectures.

389
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:46,540
So the number of participants is rather limited.

390
00:25:46,540 --> 00:25:47,959
I have an idea.

391
00:25:47,959 --> 00:25:51,339
Based on the theme "Let's be in love,"

392
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:54,099
we'll hold a Love Market event.

393
00:25:54,100 --> 00:25:58,679
The target group is our online and offline users and our partners.

394
00:25:58,679 --> 00:26:02,719
At the site, we'll set up some stalls to sell our merch.

395
00:26:02,719 --> 00:26:05,840
Also, we'll set up some areas for interaction.

396
00:26:07,180 --> 00:26:08,600
For example:

397
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:11,900
Flower arrangement area, baking area,

398
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,739
recreation area, and drawing area.

399
00:26:13,740 --> 00:26:15,759
This idea sounds very nice,

400
00:26:15,759 --> 00:26:18,379
but it's very easy to be diverted from our original intention of holding the event.

401
00:26:18,379 --> 00:26:22,379
Although our previous lectures are a little traditional in form,

402
00:26:22,379 --> 00:26:25,239
they can solve problems for our clients

403
00:26:25,239 --> 00:26:28,319
and publicize our app at a more profound level.

404
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,340
Despite the many forms of events we can choose from, our clients may not pay serious attention to any of them.

405
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:37,260
Very good, I also thought about this problem when I worked on the proposal.

406
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:39,759
Here's what I'm thinking. Before the users get in,

407
00:26:39,759 --> 00:26:42,979
ask our matchmakers to group men and women.

408
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:44,620
After they enter the venue,

409
00:26:44,620 --> 00:26:48,199
whether the users buy our merch or take part in the games,

410
00:26:48,199 --> 00:26:51,399
they all need to wear bands to buy them together.

411
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:56,159
Besides, we will still keep the traditional form of lectures.

412
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:01,319
This time, we've also invited the spokesman for our app, Ms. Qian Jingjing.

413
00:27:19,260 --> 00:27:20,860
Exactly.

414
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:24,440
Jiangyue, is his proposal realistic?

415
00:27:24,440 --> 00:27:27,500
Love Market has always been my favorite proposal.

416
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:30,059
But we still need to make plans about the new activities

417
00:27:30,059 --> 00:27:32,320
happening in the opening ceremony.

418
00:27:32,320 --> 00:27:34,739
Since Jiaxin made this proposal,

419
00:27:34,740 --> 00:27:37,960
let him take charge of the follow-up.

420
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:40,760
This way, we can know how capable he is.

421
00:27:40,760 --> 00:27:42,160
Okay. No problem.

422
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,460
You will need a colleague to assist you, right?

423
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:47,519
I'll ask Yanran to help you. Okay?

424
00:27:47,519 --> 00:27:50,019
Okay, I'll talk to her about the follow-up.

425
00:27:50,019 --> 00:27:52,060
What do you think, Jiangyue?

426
00:27:52,060 --> 00:27:53,640
I agree.

427
00:28:42,340 --> 00:28:43,960
Work hard.

428
00:28:53,780 --> 00:28:56,780
What's the matter? You're tired?

429
00:28:56,780 --> 00:28:58,500
I'm fine.

430
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:00,340
I've been a bit sleepless these days.

431
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:01,820
Drink some of this.

432
00:29:01,820 --> 00:29:03,920
It'll calm your nerves.

Thanks.

434
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:15,160
Since when have you begun to use a pen?

435
00:29:15,160 --> 00:29:17,140
It's more formal.

436
00:29:17,140 --> 00:29:21,279
By the way, Ms. Zhao, could you give me a contact list of the partners of our app?

437
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:24,519
The invitations have been made, so I will send them to our partners.

438
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:25,899
You don't need to write the contact information down.

439
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:28,480
I have the electronic copy. I'll just send it to you.

You'd better send it to the Maintenance Department.

444
00:30:24,280 --> 00:30:27,260
It will be all right. Don't worry.

445
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,160
Why have you been so serious recently?

446
00:30:46,160 --> 00:30:47,860
Are you trying to change your image?

447
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:53,000
Ms. Zhao likes mature and stable men.

448
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:56,659
For my love, I should make some changes. Why are you here?

449
00:30:56,659 --> 00:30:58,699
I want to ask Ms. Zhao for some time off. My parents are coming.

450
00:30:58,699 --> 00:31:00,459
I'll pick them up with Qi Heng.

452

00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:40,380
Yeah. The page was forcefully closed before the computer froze.

478
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:42,339
It's okay. I've sent the list to you.

479
00:33:42,339 --> 00:33:43,960
Okay.

480
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,999
Oh, right. Ms. Jin asked me to turn to you for advice if I need help.

481
00:33:46,999 --> 00:33:49,359
After the opening ceremony tomorrow, shall we do a round of inspections together?

482
00:33:49,359 --> 00:33:51,860
We can solve the problems together if there are any.

483
00:33:51,860 --> 00:33:53,699
Okay. No problem.

484
00:33:53,700 --> 00:33:55,880
Okay. I'll leave you to work.

485
00:33:57,180 --> 00:34:00,460
<i>I'll make sure that Xu Ningyuan can't find you tomorrow.</i>

486
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,780
Sir, try this.

487
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:11,820
Qi, what do your parents do?

488
00:34:11,820 --> 00:34:15,279
My mom isn't well. She's been recovering at home these two years.

489
00:34:15,279 --> 00:34:16,759
My dad works at a building materials factory.

490
00:34:16,759 --> 00:34:19,480
Occasionally, he sells materials to construction sites.

491
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:21,900
Is that so?

492
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:23,340
Are you the only child?

493
00:34:23,340 --> 00:34:25,400
Yes, I'm the only one at home.

494
00:34:25,400 --> 00:34:28,360
Duoxi said you majored in computer science.

495
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:31,739
Dad, Qi Heng is a top student who graduated from an overseas university.

496
00:34:31,739 --> 00:34:34,759
Qi, the tuition must be expensive. Right?

497
00:34:34,759 --> 00:34:37,779
Yes, but I applied for a student loan at that time.

498
00:34:37,779 --> 00:34:40,779
I studied and worked at the same time abroad. I've basically paid off the loan.

499
00:34:40,779 --> 00:34:42,680
A loan?

500
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:52,439
Please eat first, I'll take a call.

501
00:34:52,439 --> 00:34:54,600
Okay. Take your time.

502
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,400
Mom, could you not ask so many questions?

503
00:34:58,400 --> 00:35:02,200
My beloved daughter may live with him in the future.

504
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:03,900
I must have a better picture of his background.

505
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:06,700
We are not looking for a son-in-law to help us climb the social ladder.

506
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:11,100
But I'm worried that you might suffer if you insist on being with him.

507
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:13,500
Exactly. Love can't sustain your life.

508
00:35:13,500 --> 00:35:15,800
You have to cover all kinds of expenses to live in a big city.

509
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:19,800
Can someone like Qi Heng buy you an apartment here?

510
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,400
I'm afraid he can't even afford the down payment.

511
00:35:22,400 --> 00:35:24,100
I don't care about that.

512
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:25,400
I just love him.

513
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:27,400
I just want to be with him.

514
00:35:28,400 --> 00:35:32,200
Do you still remember the guy your aunt introduced to you?

515
00:35:32,200 --> 00:35:34,500
He has an apartment and a car in Sujiang. He's very stable.

516
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:36,000
I'll text you his WeChat account later.

517
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,700
You two can get to know each other.

518
00:35:37,700 --> 00:35:41,300
Mom, I don't want to do that. I already have a boyfriend. I don't need to know that guy.

519
00:35:41,300 --> 00:35:43,400
What's wrong with making a new friend?

520
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,100
I'm not asking you to marry him.

521
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:46,800
Just add him as your WeChat friend and have a meal with him.

522
00:35:46,800 --> 00:35:48,200
Then, you'll get to know each other better.

523
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:49,800
I don't want to. I have no time for that.

524
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:51,320
I still need to take part in the company's activities.

525
00:35:51,320 --> 00:35:54,150
That activity about love tomorrow

526
00:35:54,150 --> 00:35:56,600
is designed to create an opportunity for single people, isn't it?

527
00:35:56,600 --> 00:35:58,400
It's perfect. You can achieve two ends with a single effort.

528
00:35:58,400 --> 00:35:59,600
Let's drop that topic.

529
00:35:59,600 --> 00:36:01,000
Please don't arrange it for me.

530
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:03,100
Even if you did, I won't go.

531
00:36:23,800 --> 00:36:26,600
Qi Heng, why didn't you go upstairs?

532
00:36:27,800 --> 00:36:29,200
My superior called me.

533
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,000
He asked me to go back and deal with work.

534
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,700
By the way, I've paid for the meal.

535
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,600
Go then. Don't be late for work.

536
00:36:37,600 --> 00:36:39,000
Well,

537
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:42,800
what's your parents' impression of me?

538
00:36:44,300 --> 00:36:47,200
Of course, they will approve the man I love.

539
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:48,700
Don't worry.

540
00:36:48,700 --> 00:36:50,800
By the way, I'll stay at a hotel with my parents today.

541
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,300
So I can't go home with you.

542
00:36:52,300 --> 00:36:54,500
I'll go to the event tomorrow directly.

543
00:36:54,500 --> 00:36:57,200
Okay. Spend more time with them.

544
00:36:57,200 --> 00:36:58,200
Go upstairs.

545
00:36:58,200 --> 00:37:00,300
- I'll see you later then.
- Okay.

<i>- Nice!

Jiaxin,

568
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:23,900
the singer who will attend today's opening ceremony said he had a car crash on the way

569
00:38:23,900 --> 00:38:26,000
and might be late. What should we do?

570
00:38:26,000 --> 00:38:30,400
<i>After the event, we'll draw for three lucky one-day couples.</i>

573
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,800
Ms. Zhao, bad news.

574
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:39,300
The singer can't make it.

575
00:38:39,300 --> 00:38:41,100
Let's make Plan B.

576

<i>Areas such as Love Emergency...</i>

<i>- Wonderful!

581
00:38:55,400 --> 00:38:57,400

00:38:57,400 --> 00:38:58,600

What's happening?

587
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:08,200
The singer suddenly can't make it.

588
00:39:08,200 --> 00:39:09,800
What? What should we do?

589
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:11,600
I have no idea.

The answer...

595
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:04,200
is the singer is on the way.

596
00:40:06,200 --> 00:40:08,100

00:42:29,400 --> 00:42:31,600
<i>whether you'll leave the company or not.</i>

637
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:33,400
<i>The most important thing on a date</i>

638
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:35,600
<i>isn't where you are going, what you are going to do,</i>

639
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:39,000
<i>or even who you are with, but to enjoy the date</i>

640
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,300
<i>and feel your heart flutter</i>

641
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:43,000
<i>and to look forward to being in a relationship.</i>

642
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:46,700
<i>Zhao Jiangyue, I love you!</i>

643
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:49,500
<i>I'm just romantically incompetent.</i>

644
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:51,400
<i>I can't be in a relationship with anyone.</i>

645
00:42:51,400 --> 00:42:54,100
<i>Besides, I don't know how to love someone else.</i>

646
00:42:54,100 --> 00:42:57,500
<i>I know very well myself about who I love and who I don't.</i>

647
00:42:57,500 --> 00:43:00,000
<i>Do you know the other language of the cactus?</i>

648
00:43:00,000 --> 00:43:02,800
<i>It's to keep loving someone until the end.</i>

649
00:43:02,800 --> 00:43:05,400
<i>Zhao Jiangyue, I love you.</i>

650
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:07,400
<i>I can't control my feelings.</i>

651
00:43:07,400 --> 00:43:09,800
<i>My heart is beating for you every minute and every second.</i>

652
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:12,600
<i>I can't accept the future without you.</i>

653
00:43:12,600 --> 00:43:16,200
<i>You can't feel any of my sincerity?</i>

654
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,400
- <i>Let's make peace.</i>
- <i>Okay.</i>

655
00:43:19,100 --> 00:43:23,600

<i>[Happy Breakup]</i>

659
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:43,000
Why do you sometimes feel

660
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:45,900
that the person you love is within reach

661
00:43:45,900 --> 00:43:48,600
but also so distant?

662
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:52,300
Maybe your relationship

663
00:43:52,300 --> 00:43:55,800
has come to the end.

664
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:59,700
If your emotions no longer have anything to do with him

665
00:43:59,700 --> 00:44:02,400
and you no longer want to open your heart to him

666
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,600
or share your feelings with him,

667
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:08,200
it's time to consider letting go of the relationship.

668
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:10,600
It's better to end the relationship sooner than later.

669
00:44:10,600 --> 00:44:13,800
There's no need to live in your fantasy.

670
00:44:13,800 --> 00:44:17,200
Protecting the person who is right for you begins with forgetting the one who isn't.

671
00:44:18,600 --> 00:44:20,600
Are you sure?

672
00:44:20,600 --> 00:44:23,200
It's better to end the relationship sooner than later?

673
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:31,600
What about you?

674
00:44:31,600 --> 00:44:33,300
You first.

675
00:44:34,600 --> 00:44:36,200
Who wanted to end the relationship first?

676
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:38,300
It wasn't me, anyway.

677
00:44:40,700 --> 00:44:41,800
My bad.

678
00:44:41,800 --> 00:44:43,700
Stop being mad at me.

679
00:44:43,700 --> 00:44:45,900
A breakup isn't happy at all.

680
00:44:46,900 --> 00:44:49,200
I'm the happiest person when I'm with you.

681
00:44:58,200 --> 00:44:59,300
It's working hours.

682
00:44:59,300 --> 00:45:01,600
You two have to stop.
