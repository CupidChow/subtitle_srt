isn't it even more stupid?

125

146
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,600
and you got hurt?

147
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:36,620
I am thick-skinned with a tough heart.

148
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:38,620
I'm not that sensitive.

149
00:10:39,420 --> 00:10:42,780
Since you apologized, I will forgive you.

150
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:44,349
When did I apologize?

151
00:10:44,349 --> 00:10:46,490
You spoke to me first.

152
00:10:46,490 --> 00:10:49,100
Isn't it because you feel a little bit guilty?

153
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,899
It's fine. You don't need to make it clear.

154
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:53,860
I accept your apology.

155
00:10:57,790 --> 00:11:02,599
I thought about it. I overacted a bit this afternoon.

156
00:11:02,599 --> 00:11:04,750
You are in a good relationship with your girlfriend.

157
00:11:04,750 --> 00:11:07,010
I should have understood.

158
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:13,420
So, shall we reconcile?

159
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:16,260
Speak with your mouth open.

160
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:19,990
Shall we reconcile?

161
00:11:21,270 --> 00:11:22,950
Sure.

162
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,140
We'll both do our self-reflection and avoid the same mistake.

163
00:11:26,140 --> 00:11:28,240
Let's go. I will give you a ride.

00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,960
It's okay. I have my car.

165
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:33,650
I can give you a ride or I will be worried.

166
00:11:34,230 --> 00:11:36,300
Scaredy-cat.

167
00:11:51,250 --> 00:11:53,380
Love Note is finally about to launch officially.
<i>[Love Note Launching Report]</i>

168
00:11:53,380 --> 00:11:54,760
We've worked on it for such a long time.

169
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:57,010
Do you think Ms. Jin will be happy about it?
<i>[Product Algorithm]</i>

170
00:11:57,010 --> 00:11:59,199
Ms. Jin is holding a general meeting especially for it.

171
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:02,350
She seems to be very pleased with our project.

172
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:05,799
Sister Fen. Sister Fen is Ms. Jin's loyal follower.

173
00:12:05,799 --> 00:12:11,960
Sister Fen, do you think Ms. Jin will approve Love Note?

174
00:12:11,960 --> 00:12:14,459
It's hard to say. Ms. Jin has a really high standard.

175
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:16,160
Anyway, we've tried our best.

176
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:20,699
Is Ms. Jin really so strict? I think we've done a very good job.

177
00:12:20,699 --> 00:12:21,839
How could she be unsatisfied?

178
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:25,099
Ms. Jin has always been the Iron Lady in the industry.

179
00:12:25,099 --> 00:12:28,599
When she was young, she was among the first generation of programmers in China.

180
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:31,079
Ever since the establishment of Link Technology,

181
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:36,429
- Ms. Jin has been selected as the Annual Businesswoman every year.
- That's right.

182
00:12:36,429 --> 00:12:40,449
You all know how hard it is to be selected, right?

183
00:12:40,450 --> 00:12:43,629
She is like the one playing the role of God in a game.

184
00:12:43,629 --> 00:12:48,649
Don't you know that everything she owns today is built with blood, sweat, and tears?

185
00:12:48,649 --> 00:12:52,270
Do you know that in the beginning...

186
00:12:54,290 --> 00:12:58,749
in the beginning, the company was established by Ms. Jin's husband?

187
00:12:58,749 --> 00:13:00,249
It was running pretty well at that time.

188
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:03,279
Unfortunately, her husband fell ill and passed away.

189
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:05,980
With all the pressure,

190
00:13:05,980 --> 00:13:08,180
including that of other partners withdrawing money,

191
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:13,300
Ms. Jin turned things around and expanded the company into the scale it is today.

192
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:17,370
Young man, without dedication and sacrifice,

193
00:13:17,370 --> 00:13:19,250
how could she achieve it?

194
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:20,859
Stop chatting. Time for the meeting.

195
00:13:20,859 --> 00:13:23,820
- Sure.
- Sure.

196
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:25,400
Have you sorted out all the documents?

197
00:13:25,400 --> 00:13:26,910
Don't worry.

198
00:13:26,910 --> 00:13:30,550
Be serious in the meeting. Don't make any mistakes.

199
00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,739
After the launch of the application, I can soon get away from the company.

200
00:13:35,739 --> 00:13:39,160
Even if I have to pretend, I will do a good job.

201
00:13:39,160 --> 00:13:41,850
Then bring out your best performance. Let's go.

202
00:13:47,740 --> 00:13:50,009
Today's meeting will be hosted by the chairman personally.

203
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:51,910
I hope everyone can focus.

204
00:13:51,910 --> 00:13:53,470
Okay.

205
00:13:55,060 --> 00:13:57,910
- Ms. Jin.
- Ms. Jin.

206
00:14:00,470 --> 00:14:02,929
Take a seat. Let's start the meeting.

207
00:14:02,929 --> 00:14:07,479
Ms. Jin, the testing of Love Note and preparation are all done.

208
00:14:07,479 --> 00:14:09,450
The launch will be on Valentine's Day.

209
00:14:09,450 --> 00:14:13,020
Gu Jiaxin will be reporting the details.

210
00:14:16,620 --> 00:14:18,960
All right. I'm going to start.

211
00:14:28,250 --> 00:14:31,729
Compared to the other popular dating apps in the market right now,

212
00:14:31,729 --> 00:14:34,050
what makes Love Note unique...

213
00:14:35,130 --> 00:14:40,049
is that we've designed an algorithm for detailed user classification.

214
00:14:40,049 --> 00:14:43,519
Every new user who signs up is required to fill in a love questionnaire

215
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:46,159
before using the normal functions of the app.

216
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:48,489
By doing this, we can classify users accurately

217
00:14:48,490 --> 00:14:50,839
and provide targeted relationship guidance

218
00:14:50,840 --> 00:14:52,710
and dating services both online and offline.

219
00:14:52,710 --> 00:14:55,249
To encourage people to use the app,

220
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:57,700
we've also designed some interesting games

221
00:14:57,700 --> 00:15:01,989
so that users can communicate and know each other better

222
00:15:01,989 --> 00:15:04,620
in a relaxing way.

223
00:15:04,620 --> 00:15:08,600
I believe this will also attract younger users

224
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,190
and increase the usage of the app.

225
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:13,330
Everything is ready.

226
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,460
<i>[OUR VALUES: Trust, Excellence, Accountability, Collaboration, Service, Innovation, Gratitude]</i>

227
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:48,839
Jiaxin did a really good job today.

228
00:15:48,840 --> 00:15:51,009
He seems to have been well-prepared.

229
00:15:51,010 --> 00:15:53,449
Judging by the facial expression of Ms. Jin, the project should be fine.

230
00:15:53,449 --> 00:15:55,659
- We can wait for our bonus!
- Really?

231
00:15:55,659 --> 00:15:57,739
- That's right.
- Yes.

232
00:15:57,739 --> 00:16:00,060
Time to treat us!

233
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,430
Ms. Jin, are you happy with my performance today?

234
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:13,300
It's all right.

235
00:16:13,960 --> 00:16:16,790
After the launch of the app, may I have a break?

236
00:16:16,790 --> 00:16:19,359
I really need to train. I've been exhausted lately.

237
00:16:19,359 --> 00:16:21,306
It depends on your performance afterward.

238
00:16:21,306 --> 00:16:23,936
There's still a lot to do.

239
00:16:23,936 --> 00:16:27,325
I mean, what else do I need to do? I... I've tried my best.

240
00:16:27,325 --> 00:16:30,165
Performance has to be consistent.

241
00:16:30,166 --> 00:16:34,160
One good performance doesn't mean you are excellent.

242
00:16:34,725 --> 00:16:37,016
You master the art of speaking. I can't argue with you.

243
00:16:37,016 --> 00:16:38,656
Jiaxin really made huge progress.

244
00:16:38,656 --> 00:16:41,310
I believe he will get better and better.

245
00:16:42,746 --> 00:16:46,956
Right, Yanran. You've been here for a while. What do you think?

246
00:16:46,956 --> 00:16:49,925
I'm happy about it. I can stay with Jiaxin every day.

247
00:16:49,925 --> 00:16:51,426
We come to work and get off work together.

248
00:16:51,426 --> 00:16:55,656
You should give Yanran more help. She just came back to the country.

249
00:16:55,656 --> 00:16:57,946
You should take her out when you have time.

250
00:16:57,946 --> 00:17:01,990
Do you hear it? Ms. Jin, I will keep reminding him.

251
00:17:03,166 --> 00:17:06,476
Jiangyue, thank you for your hard work these days.

252
00:17:06,476 --> 00:17:10,275
After the launch of the app, our goal is to be the top product in the field.

253
00:17:10,275 --> 00:17:13,305
You have to encourage the team to keep up the good work.

254
00:17:13,305 --> 00:17:14,845
Of course. You don't need to worry.

255
00:17:14,846 --> 00:17:17,360
You have to give them a break.

256
00:17:18,056 --> 00:17:22,615
Don't be arrogant. Learn more from Ms. Zhao when it's possible.

257
00:17:22,615 --> 00:17:24,980
Don't only care about racing.

258
00:17:25,550 --> 00:17:28,050
I can stay in the company.

259
00:17:28,050 --> 00:17:31,590
But I can't give up racing.

260
00:17:33,176 --> 00:17:36,515
Yanran, you have been back for a while, but I haven't had a meal with you.

261
00:17:36,515 --> 00:17:38,935
And I still have meetings today. How about this?

262
00:17:38,935 --> 00:17:43,085
- Lisheng, book a restaurant for them to enjoy a decent meal.
- Okay.

263
00:17:43,085 --> 00:17:45,276
Thank you, Ms. Jin. You know me the best.

264
00:17:45,276 --> 00:17:46,926
Then I'm leaving.

265
00:17:46,926 --> 00:17:48,930
- I will see you out.
- Bye.

266
00:17:54,126 --> 00:17:58,090
Did you hear it? Ms. Jin asked you to spend more time with me.

267
00:17:59,190 --> 00:18:01,590
Hey. Hey!

268
00:18:11,516 --> 00:18:14,070
Eat. I'm about to finish.

269
00:18:17,546 --> 00:18:20,415
The five-star rating is fake, isn't it? This is horrible.

270
00:18:20,415 --> 00:18:21,626
This is what Western cuisine is like, right?

271
00:18:21,626 --> 00:18:24,980
No. This one is not authentic.

272
00:18:27,436 --> 00:18:29,146
I'm full. I'm done.

273
00:18:29,146 --> 00:18:31,235
Great. Let's head back to the company.

274
00:18:31,235 --> 00:18:32,990
Wait for a second.

275
00:18:33,646 --> 00:18:38,476
Something is wrong with you. You used to hate going to work.

276
00:18:38,476 --> 00:18:40,846
Why are you working so hard now?

277
00:18:40,846 --> 00:18:42,765
We just got out of the company,

278
00:18:42,766 --> 00:18:45,536
and you are rushing back to work now.

279
00:18:45,536 --> 00:18:47,746
Am I?

280
00:18:47,746 --> 00:18:52,176
I'm just trying to get things done and make my mother happy.

281
00:18:52,176 --> 00:18:54,740
It's more than that.

282
00:18:57,366 --> 00:18:59,766
Wait for me!

283
00:18:59,766 --> 00:19:01,980

Look at this! A florist!

00:19:09,345 --> 00:19:11,146
Will you send me flowers on Valentine's Day?

Okay. Thank you.

Jiaxin, guess what kind of flower I like.

00:19:46,646 --> 00:19:48,755
- Crested dog's-tail.

Why don't you just say broccoli?

for speaking for me in front of my mother.

I'm grateful and returning the favor with a gift.

You've grown up. Does the cactus mean

307
00:21:13,966 --> 00:21:16,866
that I'm beautiful but too sharp?

308
00:21:16,866 --> 00:21:21,806
No. There's another language for cactus.

309
00:21:21,806 --> 00:21:25,870
It's warm and strong. So are you.

310
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:29,146
The main reason is that someone has pollen allergies,

311
00:21:29,146 --> 00:21:32,526
and cactus can avoid the risk.

312

She doesn't want to share the chocolate.

- We will have the cookies.
- Have some cookies.

Let's have the cookies.

342

- Good morning, Ms. Zhao.

343
00:23:35,086 --> 00:23:37,205
- Hand me a cookie.
- It's good.

Let me give some cookies and chocolate to Ms. Zhao.

Don't you know?

Someone sent Ms. Zhao a special gift for Valentine's Day today.

I can't believe it's real!

377
00:25:57,246 --> 00:25:58,915
So excited. Are you not single anymore?

378
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:01,246
It's my lucky day!

379

Qiuqiu is amazing!

380
00:26:02,846 --> 00:26:06,765
She got two tickets of New Boys' fan meeting from scalpers.

381
00:26:06,765 --> 00:26:11,155
I never thought I could spend Valentine's Day with my idols.

382
00:26:12,766 --> 00:26:15,735
You are a lady, and all you think about is your idols.

383
00:26:15,735 --> 00:26:17,856
Aren't you afraid of being single forever?

384
00:26:17,856 --> 00:26:19,696
I have my idols.

385
00:26:19,696 --> 00:26:21,626
I don't need anyone else!

386
00:26:23,196 --> 00:26:25,646
You are going to the fan meeting. How about Qi Heng?

387
00:26:25,646 --> 00:26:27,105
Doesn't he have a day off?

388
00:26:27,105 --> 00:26:29,480
You two have no plans?
<i>[Fan Meeting and Hi-5]</i>

389
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:31,065
What kind of plans do we have?

390
00:26:31,065 --> 00:26:32,555
He went out early in the morning.

391
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:35,426
He must have some other plans.

392
00:26:37,216 --> 00:26:40,275
Are you saying Qi Heng left you to celebrate Valentine's Day with someone else?

393
00:26:41,316 --> 00:26:43,005
But this is normal, right?

394
00:26:43,006 --> 00:26:46,675
There must be many girls asking a guy like him out on Valentine's Day.

395
00:26:46,675 --> 00:26:49,296
Right. Two slow persons are trying to get together.

396
00:26:49,296 --> 00:26:51,016
One has to straighten things out first.

397
00:26:51,016 --> 00:26:52,746
Don't make fun of me.

398
00:26:52,746 --> 00:26:54,606
I like him. It's true.

399
00:26:54,606 --> 00:26:57,246
But who knows what he thinks?

400
00:26:57,246 --> 00:27:00,305
- I can ask him for you
- Please don't.

401
00:27:00,305 --> 00:27:03,485
If he doesn't like me, we can't be roommates anymore.

402
00:27:06,766 --> 00:27:10,095
I'm not going to think about it. Today, my idols are the most important.

Jingjing.

416
00:28:29,006 --> 00:28:32,746
I didn't expect that I would spend my Valentine's Day with you first.

417
00:28:34,006 --> 00:28:36,246
This is for you.

418
00:28:36,246 --> 00:28:39,055
If you were a guy, I would choose you as my boyfriend.

419
00:28:39,055 --> 00:28:41,845
You are much more important than men for me.

420

What's your plan for Valentine's Day?

421
00:28:43,636 --> 00:28:44,965
You can't still be working, right?

422
00:28:44,966 --> 00:28:46,645
I surely need to work until midnight.

423
00:28:46,646 --> 00:28:50,345
So other than me, have you received any other Valentine's gifts from others?

424
00:28:50,345 --> 00:28:53,016
Did Xu Ningyuan send you anything?

425
00:28:53,016 --> 00:28:54,796
He sent me a laptop.

426
00:28:54,796 --> 00:28:57,825
I was thinking about sending him the same thing.

427
00:28:57,825 --> 00:28:59,756
It's more practical.

428
00:28:59,756 --> 00:29:02,386
It's important to send a practical present to a guy,

429
00:29:02,386 --> 00:29:05,865
but sending a present is more than exchanging value.

430
00:29:05,865 --> 00:29:09,805
You have to let him get the message from what you do.

431
00:29:09,805 --> 00:29:13,265
So your present is a statement of your relationship.

432
00:29:13,265 --> 00:29:15,535
It doesn't have to be expensive,

433
00:29:15,535 --> 00:29:17,686
but it has to spark some romantic interaction.

434
00:29:17,686 --> 00:29:19,796
Got it?

435
00:29:19,796 --> 00:29:21,245
I will think about it.

436
00:29:21,246 --> 00:29:24,626
Ms. Zhao, the fans are ready to enter.

437

Hello, everyone, I'm Qian Jingjing.

Ms. Jingjing, it's Valentine's Day today.

<i>I feel very lucky to have met you after I made some achievements.</i>

<i>I can give you the best with no hesitation.</i>

449
00:30:09,945 --> 00:30:12,216
<i>From this moment onward, I want to spend every year,</i>

<i>every month, and every day with you.</i>

<i>I know it's not a fancy way to say I love you,</i>

<i>but I mean it.</i>

453
00:30:24,536 --> 00:30:28,115
Mr. Zhang has always been a gentleman in front of me,

454
00:30:28,115 --> 00:30:32,446
but in terms of this, he didn't let me win.

455
00:30:32,446 --> 00:30:35,015
So, Ms. Jingjing, could you please tell us

456
00:30:35,015 --> 00:30:37,936
how Mr. Zhang confessed his love to you?

457
00:30:38,966 --> 00:30:42,706
It was when he just started his business.

458
00:30:42,706 --> 00:30:45,096
He worked really hard.

459
00:30:45,096 --> 00:30:50,246
He said, he would work even harder in the future to offer me a better life.

460
00:31:02,796 --> 00:31:03,915
You're here.

461
00:31:03,915 --> 00:31:05,866
Asking me out on Valentine's Day?

462
00:31:05,866 --> 00:31:07,555
Do you think that's what I want?

463
00:31:07,556 --> 00:31:10,685
I have someone else in mind, but she didn't want to see me.

464
00:31:10,685 --> 00:31:14,345
- What can I do?
- You are so slow, Qi Heng.

465
00:31:14,345 --> 00:31:16,275
No wonder Zheng Duoxi doesn't dare to tell you anything.

466
00:31:16,276 --> 00:31:19,145
She doesn't dare to tell me anything? She's more daring than anyone else.

467
00:31:19,145 --> 00:31:22,295
Every time I ask if she has anyone she likes, she says yes.

468
00:31:22,295 --> 00:31:25,015
There are many of them as well, and they are all her husbands.

469
00:31:25,015 --> 00:31:26,915
That's obviously telling me to give up.

470
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:30,035
Zheng Duoxi likes her idols and all the fans call their idols "husband."

471
00:31:30,035 --> 00:31:32,345
- You don't know that?
- Right.

472
00:31:32,345 --> 00:31:37,156
Her idols are handsome, talented, and famous.

473
00:31:37,156 --> 00:31:40,446
How could she possibly like me?

474
00:31:40,446 --> 00:31:42,566
I mean, what are you talking about, Qi Heng?

475
00:31:42,566 --> 00:31:44,646
Are we still on the same page?

00:31:44,646 --> 00:31:46,456
Zheng Duoxi likes you!

477
00:31:46,456 --> 00:31:49,126
Yes, she likes...

478
00:31:51,396 --> 00:31:55,975
- What?
- Zheng Duoxi. likes. you.

479
00:31:55,975 --> 00:31:58,345
- Me?
- Let me ask you something.

480
00:31:58,345 --> 00:31:59,915
Valentine's Day is such a good opportunity.

481
00:31:59,916 --> 00:32:01,446
Why didn't you confess your feelings?

482
00:32:01,446 --> 00:32:04,075
Zheng Duoxi wanted to ask you out. Why did you turn her down?

483
00:32:04,075 --> 00:32:06,195
When did she want to ask me out? I didn't know!

484
00:32:06,195 --> 00:32:09,945
She wanted to, but you were out early in the morning. Where did you go?

485
00:32:09,945 --> 00:32:12,016
She thought you were avoiding her!

486
00:32:12,016 --> 00:32:14,546
I went to get the ticket for her!

487
00:32:14,546 --> 00:32:19,895
- What ticket?
- The ticket for her idols' fan meeting.

488
00:32:19,895 --> 00:32:21,686
I'm going to stab you!

489
00:32:21,686 --> 00:32:23,426
You two are...

490
00:32:23,426 --> 00:32:27,106
You are the most irritating couple in the world.

491
00:32:27,106 --> 00:32:28,816
You are making my blood boil.

492
00:32:28,816 --> 00:32:30,315
What are you talking about?

493
00:32:30,316 --> 00:32:34,116
I thought it was interesting to see which one of you would confess first.

494
00:32:34,116 --> 00:32:36,635
I didn't expect that you two are so good at suppressing your feelings.

495
00:32:36,635 --> 00:32:39,586
Today, I'm going to do a favor for you.

496
00:32:39,586 --> 00:32:42,239
If you two love each other, just get together.

497
00:32:42,240 --> 00:32:44,289
Don't pretend to be single every day.

498
00:32:44,290 --> 00:32:47,199
It's Valentine's Day. If you don't confess now, when are you going to do it?

499
00:32:47,199 --> 00:32:49,680
To confess on Valentine's Day?

500
00:32:49,680 --> 00:32:51,430
Isn't it Valentine's Day today?

501
00:32:51,430 --> 00:32:54,710
So... I'm going to tell her now?

502
00:32:54,710 --> 00:32:57,939
- Or?
- Thank you. I'm leaving.

503
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:02,579
Well, your event is not finished yet, right?

504
00:33:02,579 --> 00:33:04,030
Can you actually stay here?

505
00:33:04,030 --> 00:33:06,439
Could you please forget about me for now, my friend? Just go!

506
00:33:06,439 --> 00:33:08,210
I... I'm going.

507
00:33:11,430 --> 00:33:13,100
Get it done!

508
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:23,509
<i>Jiaxin, the company's event is done.</i>

509
00:33:23,509 --> 00:33:25,389
<i>We can celebrate our lovely Valentine's Day now.</i>

510
00:33:25,389 --> 00:33:27,980
<i>Where are you?</i>

511
00:33:27,980 --> 00:33:29,199
<i>Don't look for me.</i>

512
00:33:29,200 --> 00:33:32,910
<i>I'm in a five-dimension space.</i>

513
00:33:44,790 --> 00:33:47,399
To all my stars, thank you so much

514
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:49,569
for spending a beautiful Valentine's Day with us.

515
00:33:49,569 --> 00:33:53,420
Just now, our system was hacked.

516
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:55,739
However, after learning the reason and story behind it,

517
00:33:55,739 --> 00:33:58,430
every one of us and our staff were deeply touched.

518
00:33:58,430 --> 00:34:01,200
So now, please welcome

519
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,160
the charming hacker to the stage!

520

Hello, all the fans of New Boys.

524
00:34:25,500 --> 00:34:29,530
I want to say sorry to you officially here.

525
00:34:29,530 --> 00:34:33,100
I did hack the system of this event,

526
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:36,000
but I didn't do anything bad.

527
00:34:36,000 --> 00:34:39,860
I just wanted to confess my love to a girl

528
00:34:39,860 --> 00:34:43,830
I've been having a crush on for years in front of her idols.

00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:53,730
<i>Who is she?</i>

532
00:34:57,940 --> 00:34:59,960
Zheng Duoxi,

533
00:35:00,630 --> 00:35:04,060
I've always wanted to say this in front of you,

534
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:06,280
but I never did it.

535
00:35:06,280 --> 00:35:08,620
It's Valentine's Day today.

536
00:35:09,280 --> 00:35:12,550
I want to say it out loud

537
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,850
in front of the idols you try to protect.

538
00:35:15,890 --> 00:35:19,560
Zheng Duoxi, I like you.

539
00:35:22,260 --> 00:35:26,920
I will be the one protecting your future.

540

Zheng Duoxi,

541
00:35:55,390 --> 00:35:58,030
are you willing to be my girlfriend?

Why are you here?

563
00:38:14,030 --> 00:38:16,960
I... There wasn't much to do after it started.

564
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:20,600
So I did a relationship consultation for a friend.

565
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,700
Guess you had a busy day then.

566
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,560
I thought you went to date the young lady.

567
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:29,330
There's nothing between Li Yanran and me.

568

She seems good at it.

571
00:38:37,360 --> 00:38:41,529
Maybe you need to use the Sunflower Manual to win.
<i>(Name of a technique in a Martial Arts novel)</i>

572
00:38:41,529 --> 00:38:43,800
Don't curse me.

573
00:38:43,800 --> 00:38:46,700
Or maybe my future girlfriend...

574
00:38:50,790 --> 00:38:52,300
will come after you.

575
00:38:52,300 --> 00:38:54,990
I'm so scared.

576
00:38:54,990 --> 00:38:57,180
Move this out.

577
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,449
I will help you.
<i>[Love Note]</i>

578
00:38:59,449 --> 00:39:01,140
All right.

579
00:39:09,420 --> 00:39:11,430
Are you all right?

580
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:14,000
It hurts.

581
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,480
Here?

582
00:39:17,480 --> 00:39:18,850
Yes.

583
00:39:18,850 --> 00:39:21,940
You had an injury in this hand before, right?

584
00:39:21,940 --> 00:39:24,660
I hurt it once when I played golf.

585
00:39:24,660 --> 00:39:26,550
And it was bumped just now.

586
00:39:26,550 --> 00:39:30,070
From the x-ray, the hand has a slight fracture.

587
00:39:30,070 --> 00:39:32,579
I've put a splint on it and stabilized it with plaster.

588
00:39:32,579 --> 00:39:34,700
Don't move freely before full recovery.

589
00:39:34,700 --> 00:39:37,729
If it doesn't recover properly, you may get a malunion fracture.

590
00:39:37,729 --> 00:39:39,999
If that happens, your hand won't have any strength.

591
00:39:39,999 --> 00:39:42,070
Understood.

592
00:39:42,070 --> 00:39:44,460
Your girlfriend got injured on Valentine's Day.

593
00:39:44,460 --> 00:39:46,490
You didn't do well as her boyfriend.

594
00:39:46,490 --> 00:39:49,580
You are right. I didn't look after her well.

595
00:39:49,580 --> 00:39:52,630
Doctor, is her hand going to be fine?

596
00:39:52,630 --> 00:39:55,470
It depends on the recovery,

597
00:39:55,470 --> 00:39:59,059
but she mustn't use this hand of hers anytime soon. Do you understand?

598
00:39:59,059 --> 00:40:00,530
I will look after her.

599
00:40:00,530 --> 00:40:02,999
- All right. Go get the medicine.
- Thank you, Doctor.

600
00:40:02,999 --> 00:40:05,800

00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:24,490
All right. Drop the act.

603
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:28,150
Yueyue, the doctor asked me to look after you.

604
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:30,030
No need.

605
00:40:31,260 --> 00:40:32,950
Look at your hand.

606
00:40:32,950 --> 00:40:35,030
I will give you a nickname.

608
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,200
Stop making fun of it.

609
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,980
I'm sorry.

610
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:41,980
I did this to you.

611
00:40:41,980 --> 00:40:44,450
I will take care of you these next few days.

612

I'm really thoughtful when I take care of others.

I said no.

I won.

637
00:42:18,940 --> 00:42:22,600
In the honeymoon stage, the relationship is at its peak.

638
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:26,000
You would like to put in the most in this stage.

639
00:42:26,000 --> 00:42:33,050
So things like perfume and watches are perfect.

640
00:42:33,900 --> 00:42:35,460
Next is the stable stage.

641
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:39,759
In this stage, your present should be both practical and durable.

642
00:42:39,759 --> 00:42:44,530
For example, the noise-canceling headphone or

643
00:42:44,530 --> 00:42:48,270
the latest razor. How's that?

644
00:42:48,270 --> 00:42:51,449
Keep it up. You will succeed.

645
00:42:51,449 --> 00:42:55,599
I know. You need to learn from me as well,

646
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,680
so that you can receive happiness in love.

647
00:42:59,680 --> 00:43:02,360
This is a great noise-canceling headphone.

648
00:43:05,830 --> 00:43:08,130
Learn from Miss Yanran!

649
00:43:08,130 --> 00:43:10,040
Did you hear it?
