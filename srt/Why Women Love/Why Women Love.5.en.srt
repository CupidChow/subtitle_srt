00:13:15,180 --> 00:13:17,469
Cheater! How dare you bully my best friend?

164
00:13:17,470 --> 00:13:19,960
And you dare to cheat?

165
00:13:25,790 --> 00:13:28,540
I'll teach you a lesson today.

166
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:33,320
Jerk.

167
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:37,760
It's me!

168
00:13:40,010 --> 00:13:42,459
- Gu Jiaxin?
- Why are you here?

169
00:13:42,459 --> 00:13:44,349
No, what are you doing here?

170
00:13:44,350 --> 00:13:45,959
You are so young, why are you here for a massage?

171
00:13:45,960 --> 00:13:47,460
Why can't I have a massage?

172
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:50,229
Well, isn't this Zhang Hao's room?

173
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:52,200
Why are you here?

174
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:53,840
I don't know. I...

175
00:13:53,840 --> 00:13:55,639
Jing... Jingjing recommended this place to me.

176
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,709
Then, where's Zhang Hao?

177
00:13:56,710 --> 00:13:59,090
- How would I know?
- No.

178
00:13:59,090 --> 00:14:00,610
I mean, can you let me go?

179
00:14:00,610 --> 00:14:02,550
Okay.

180
00:14:11,740 --> 00:14:13,790
I'm sorry.

181
00:14:14,450 --> 00:14:16,930
So it's real between Jingjing and Zhang Hao?

182
00:14:17,550 --> 00:14:19,270
They divorced.

183
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,620
You have to keep this a secret.

184
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:26,399
Due to professional considerations, Jingjing may delay this announcement.

185
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,179
The thing is, can you check first before making a move?

186
00:14:29,179 --> 00:14:31,570
Can you not hurt the innocent?

187
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:34,379
The lighting is too dark here. I didn't see properly.

188
00:14:34,379 --> 00:14:36,440
Plus, you didn't have a face.

189
00:14:37,810 --> 00:14:40,299
- You have to take responsibility.
- Responsibility?

190
00:14:40,299 --> 00:14:44,009
Don't worry. I will definitely wipe it all off for you.

191
00:14:46,180 --> 00:14:48,320
Are you afraid of pain?

192
00:14:51,500 --> 00:14:55,229
I'm going to start.
<i>[Jerk!]</i>

193
00:14:55,229 --> 00:14:56,999
Wait, why do I feel like something's wrong?

194
00:14:57,000 --> 00:14:59,879
Nothing's wrong. Bear with it.

195
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,900
- Hey, hey, hey...
- Huh?

196
00:15:05,980 --> 00:15:08,359
- It's itchy.
- Itchy?

197
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:11,079
I can't scrub it off with this.

198
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:13,210
Wait, I'll switch to another one.

199
00:15:14,790 --> 00:15:17,930
This might be a little painful. Bear with it.

200
00:15:17,930 --> 00:15:19,570
Here I come.

201
00:15:21,650 --> 00:15:23,989
- Don't move.
- No.

202
00:15:23,989 --> 00:15:25,639
- Do it gently.
- Right, gently.

203
00:15:25,639 --> 00:15:27,609
How can I scrub it off if I do it gently?

204
00:15:27,609 --> 00:15:29,230
No!

205
00:15:31,880 --> 00:15:34,689
- Let's take a break.
- What break? We have to scrub it off quickly,

206
00:15:34,689 --> 00:15:37,230
if not, it'll be even harder.

207
00:15:37,230 --> 00:15:39,679
No, no. It can't be scrubbed off?

208
00:15:39,679 --> 00:15:43,870
- The seller said that it might last for over a week.
- Wait! What?

209
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:46,020
Don't worry. I've got more.

210
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:48,340
No. No, this won't do.

211
00:15:48,340 --> 00:15:50,329
- It will!
- No not this one.

212
00:15:50,329 --> 00:15:53,230
Let me tell you. Turn around, don't move, and it will be fine.

213
00:15:54,200 --> 00:15:56,060
Don't move.

214
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:58,339
- No, wait.
- It's coming off, look!

215
00:15:58,339 --> 00:15:59,840
No, stop!

216
00:16:01,030 --> 00:16:02,029
I feel like my skin is torn.

217
00:16:02,030 --> 00:16:04,259
- No, it's good if it's torn.
- No.

218
00:16:04,259 --> 00:16:05,549
It has to be torn for it to come off.

219
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:07,720
Don't move. Why isn't it working?

220
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:08,909
I'll switch to another one.

221
00:16:08,910 --> 00:16:10,689
No, no. This one won't do.

222
00:16:10,689 --> 00:16:12,149
- This one will work.
- Not this, not this.

223
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:14,899
- This will definitely work.
- No, this one won't do.

224
00:16:14,899 --> 00:16:17,310
No, listen to me. Turn around.

225
00:16:17,320 --> 00:16:18,910
Wait.

226
00:16:21,415 --> 00:16:23,275
Wait.

227
00:16:26,445 --> 00:16:28,205
Good idea.

228
00:16:28,205 --> 00:16:30,575
I'll start now. Bear with it.

229
00:16:30,575 --> 00:16:34,105
Three, two...

230
00:16:43,575 --> 00:16:45,035
Come in.

231
00:16:45,035 --> 00:16:47,085
You!

232
00:16:47,085 --> 00:16:48,394
You are a liar.

233
00:16:48,394 --> 00:16:51,894
You told me that you scrubbed it all off yesterday, but none of the characters were scrubbed off when I took a look.

234
00:16:54,125 --> 00:16:55,154
I'm sorry.

235
00:16:55,154 --> 00:16:57,585
I didn't know that the quality of that marker was so good.

236
00:16:57,585 --> 00:17:00,765
Please accept my apology. Just wait for seven days.

237
00:17:00,824 --> 00:17:04,345
What? Seven days?

238
00:17:04,345 --> 00:17:06,034
I have to carry these words for seven days?

239
00:17:06,034 --> 00:17:08,274
A week will fly by in a blink of an eye.

240
00:17:08,274 --> 00:17:11,064
You're wearing clothes, others can't see it anyway. You aren't going out naked.

241
00:17:11,064 --> 00:17:12,425
I...

242
00:17:12,425 --> 00:17:15,185
My heart was hurt.

243
00:17:20,465 --> 00:17:23,945
Then tell me. How should I make it up to you?

244
00:17:27,255 --> 00:17:28,835
I can't think of anything right now,

245
00:17:28,835 --> 00:17:30,684
but you owe me one.

246
00:17:30,684 --> 00:17:33,684
All right, all right. Then I'll owe you.

247
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:50,025
How can I wash the words off?

248
00:17:51,485 --> 00:17:53,305
Petrol?

249
00:18:00,565 --> 00:18:02,345
What's wrong?

250
00:18:02,345 --> 00:18:04,845
Why do you look so depressed?

251
00:18:05,945 --> 00:18:10,134
My roommate is suddenly moving in with her boyfriend.

252
00:18:10,975 --> 00:18:13,055
What's there to be sad about?

253
00:18:13,055 --> 00:18:14,754
Isn't it better to live alone?

254
00:18:14,754 --> 00:18:17,494
I'm a small corporate slave, I'm poor.

255
00:18:17,495 --> 00:18:21,804
Now that my roommate is gone, I'll have to pay the rent for two people.

256
00:18:23,185 --> 00:18:25,455
I'm going to be so poor.

257
00:18:25,455 --> 00:18:27,345
What's there to worry about?

258
00:18:27,345 --> 00:18:30,005
You can just go online and find another roommate.

259
00:18:32,355 --> 00:18:33,975
I'll post on social media.

260
00:18:33,975 --> 00:18:35,064
Really?

261
00:18:35,065 --> 00:18:37,305

You're not stuttering anymore!

It's all thanks to you helping me all those years ago.

No problem.

301
00:22:23,595 --> 00:22:25,754
You are here for the interview as my new roommate, right?

302
00:22:25,754 --> 00:22:27,094
You are Gu Jiaxin's good friend?

303
00:22:27,095 --> 00:22:29,704
Yes, Jiaxin and I used to be university classmates.

304
00:22:29,705 --> 00:22:31,854
I saw on his Moments that you were looking for a roommate.

305
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:33,304
I'm looking for a place to stay,

306
00:22:33,305 --> 00:22:37,805
but I don't know if you mind having me as your roommate.

307
00:22:38,335 --> 00:22:41,614
Actually, I wanted to find a female roommate,

308
00:22:41,615 --> 00:22:44,115
because it's more convenient.

309
00:22:45,335 --> 00:22:48,545
But if it's you, sure!

310
00:22:49,255 --> 00:22:51,755
We used to be classmates.

311
00:22:57,375 --> 00:23:00,785
Re-Really? That's great!

312
00:23:00,785 --> 00:23:03,164
I've been living with Jiaxin, it has been inconvenient.

313
00:23:03,164 --> 00:23:04,454
I want to move out as soon as possible.

If you don't have much, you can move in today.

My WeChat Moments?

325
00:23:48,215 --> 00:23:51,105
Don't tell me you're going to live with Zheng Duoxi?

326
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:54,085
Did you...

327
00:23:54,085 --> 00:23:56,725
Did you come back because of her?

328
00:23:59,615 --> 00:24:01,645
You are capable!

329
00:24:03,805 --> 00:24:06,925
I got it. All right, you pack up. I'll help you move.

330
00:24:06,925 --> 00:24:09,055
No need. I'm done packing.

331
00:24:09,055 --> 00:24:11,834
Now, this instant, immediately. Bring me there.

332
00:24:19,485 --> 00:24:20,825
Let's go.

333
00:24:21,855 --> 00:24:23,465
Wear your shoes.

334
00:24:28,945 --> 00:24:30,875
Look at how excited you are.

335
00:25:01,425 --> 00:25:04,354
- Hello?
<i>- Jiaxin, where are you?</i>

336
00:25:04,354 --> 00:25:06,935
Can you come and hang out with me?

337
00:25:06,935 --> 00:25:09,424
No, I have something on today. I made plans with someone.

338
00:25:09,424 --> 00:25:12,255
You made plans with someone? Male or female?

339
00:25:12,255 --> 00:25:14,394
Male, male. I'm hanging up.

340
00:25:14,394 --> 00:25:15,880
<i>Don't! Don't!</i>

341
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:17,370
You'll go racing, right?

342
00:25:17,375 --> 00:25:19,450
<i>No, I...</i>

343
00:25:19,450 --> 00:25:21,110
I have something else.

344
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:22,995
I'm hanging up.

345
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,625
Don't try to avoid me.

346
00:25:47,665 --> 00:25:50,845
Jiaxin! Keep it up!

347
00:25:50,845 --> 00:25:54,095
Keep it up! Jiaxin!

348

<i>[Yiqi Racing]</i>
Jiaxin! You are the best!

00:26:21,765 --> 00:26:23,405
Keep it up!

350
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:36,200
- Jiaxin, you are still so...
- Hot, hot, hot.

351
00:26:36,375 --> 00:26:37,615
You are still so good.

352
00:26:38,625 --> 00:26:41,524
- Yanran, long time no see.
- Long time no see, Zheng.

353
00:26:41,524 --> 00:26:44,225
You are still so handsome.

354
00:26:44,225 --> 00:26:45,675
Zheng.

Lap time is stable. Your condition is good.

Keep it up.

357
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:53,104
- I'll take this for analysis.
- Okay. sure.

358
00:26:53,104 --> 00:26:54,924
- Thank you.
- No problem.

359
00:27:02,545 --> 00:27:04,424
Jiaxin, are you tired?

360
00:27:04,425 --> 00:27:06,274
Should I get a bottle of water for you?

361
00:27:06,274 --> 00:27:07,605
Okay.

362
00:27:08,905 --> 00:27:10,734
Zheng, I'll get a bottle for you, too.

363
00:27:10,735 --> 00:27:12,135
Okay.

364
00:27:30,115 --> 00:27:31,945
<i>It seems so.</i>

365
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:35,704
Hi! You're here?

366
00:27:35,800 --> 00:27:38,600
Isn't this Ms. Zhao? How long has it been since we last met?

367
00:27:38,615 --> 00:27:40,494
I heard you're very successful in your career.

368
00:27:40,495 --> 00:27:42,634
No, I was just lucky.

369
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:43,854
I'm so envious of you.

370
00:27:43,855 --> 00:27:45,584
Look at you, you're successful,

371
00:27:45,585 --> 00:27:47,565
and your figure is so well-maintained.

372
00:27:47,565 --> 00:27:48,854
Look at me.

373
00:27:48,855 --> 00:27:50,424
From dating to marriage,

374
00:27:50,425 --> 00:27:53,074
my weight has been going up. I've never lost any weight.

375
00:27:53,074 --> 00:27:54,884
Enough, you're living well.

376
00:27:54,884 --> 00:27:56,704
This is called happiness fat.

377
00:27:56,704 --> 00:27:58,904
Unlike my husband, he just plays games every day.

378
00:27:58,905 --> 00:28:00,985
He doesn't spend time with me.

379
00:28:02,755 --> 00:28:05,625
<i>Mr. Xu, long time no see.</i>

380
00:28:05,625 --> 00:28:07,034
How's your business?

381
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:08,235
It's doing well.

382
00:28:08,235 --> 00:28:10,204
- Take a seat.
- All right.

383
00:28:11,375 --> 00:28:13,615
<i>Why is he here?</i>

384
00:28:13,615 --> 00:28:15,605
<i>What a coincidence.</i>

385
00:28:16,185 --> 00:28:18,385
<i>This must be fate.</i>

386
00:28:23,185 --> 00:28:25,584
<i>Zhao Jiangyue, you must be brave.</i>

387
00:28:25,585 --> 00:28:27,254
<i>The opportunity is right in front of you.</i>

388
00:28:27,255 --> 00:28:29,155
<i>Don't miss it.</i>

389
00:28:33,735 --> 00:28:35,225
<i>Mr. Xu.</i>

390
00:28:54,355 --> 00:28:56,035
<i>Lu.</i>

391
00:28:57,205 --> 00:28:58,895
<i>Don't go.</i>

392
00:29:00,725 --> 00:29:02,435
<i>Don't go.</i>

393
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,544
Sorry, I'm late.

394
00:29:30,545 --> 00:29:32,405
It's okay. Let's go.

395
00:29:36,335 --> 00:29:39,094
Mr. Xu! Hello, Mr. Xu.

396
00:29:39,094 --> 00:29:40,655
You're all here.

397
00:29:40,655 --> 00:29:42,805
Eat first, I have to witness the marriage,

398
00:29:42,805 --> 00:29:44,565
- I'll come back later.
- Okay.

399
00:29:44,565 --> 00:29:47,425
Is that Mr. Xu's new girlfriend?

400
00:29:48,845 --> 00:29:52,015
Jiangyue, you are most familiar with Mr. Xu,

401
00:29:52,015 --> 00:29:53,705
you didn't know?

402
00:29:53,705 --> 00:29:55,815
I... I didn't know.

403
00:29:55,815 --> 00:29:59,634
I heard that Mr. Xu has an unforgettable first girlfriend.

404
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,664
I think she fell ill and died.

405
00:30:01,665 --> 00:30:05,554
Yes. It's been so many years, but I've never seen him date again.

406
00:30:05,554 --> 00:30:08,504
He's very loyal, but in the end, even he has been won over.

407
00:30:08,504 --> 00:30:11,615
I think they look good together. And you?

408
00:30:11,615 --> 00:30:13,614
You're nearing thirty, don't tell me you're still single?

409
00:30:13,615 --> 00:30:15,374
Exactly, do you have anyone in mind?

410
00:30:15,375 --> 00:30:16,584
If you don't, you better hurry.

411
00:30:16,585 --> 00:30:17,974
If you don't, I can introduce someone to you.

412
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:20,355
I have a boyfriend.

413
00:30:20,905 --> 00:30:23,045
- He'll come over later.
- Okay.

414
00:30:23,045 --> 00:30:24,904
- That's good.
- Yes.

415
00:30:24,905 --> 00:30:26,324
<i>I think you've slimmed down again.</i>

416
00:30:26,324 --> 00:30:28,375
<i>- Exactly, you've become prettier.
- You've become more handsome.</i>

417
00:30:28,375 --> 00:30:29,824
<i>You've become prettier.</i>

418
00:30:29,825 --> 00:30:31,365
<i>Thank you.</i>

419
00:30:36,455 --> 00:30:37,784
<i>Come and help me out.</i>

420
00:30:37,785 --> 00:30:39,385
<i>What's wrong?</i>

421
00:30:41,185 --> 00:30:42,784
<i>Pretend to be my boyfriend and save me from a social situation.</i>

422
00:30:42,785 --> 00:30:45,704
<i>This is work. It'll be absent from work if you don't come.</i>

423
00:30:48,515 --> 00:30:53,044
<i>I can come, but I want to apply for a day off next week.</i>

424
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:58,545
<i>Approved.</i>

425
00:30:59,495 --> 00:31:01,515
- Zheng, I'll get going.
- Okay.

426
00:31:01,515 --> 00:31:02,745
I'll leave my bike here.

427
00:31:02,745 --> 00:31:04,534
- Come and train if you can.
- Okay,

428
00:31:04,534 --> 00:31:05,614
Look for Lin if I'm not around.

429
00:31:05,615 --> 00:31:07,215
Okay.

430
00:31:09,255 --> 00:31:11,795
Jiaxin.

431
00:31:13,585 --> 00:31:15,424
Zheng, where's Jiaxin?

432
00:31:15,425 --> 00:31:17,684
- He left.
- He left?

433
00:31:18,805 --> 00:31:20,285
Water.

434
00:31:22,425 --> 00:31:24,515
Just one bottle is enough.

435
00:32:15,565 --> 00:32:17,935
- I'm afraid I have to leave now.
- Bye.

436
00:32:17,975 --> 00:32:19,854
It's time, let's go.

437
00:32:19,855 --> 00:32:21,005
Okay.

438
00:32:21,005 --> 00:32:24,295
- Jiangyue, we're leaving.
- Okay.

439
00:32:24,295 --> 00:32:26,785
- Where's your boyfriend?
- Why isn't he here to pick you up?

440
00:32:27,495 --> 00:32:28,824
He may be stuck in traffic.

441
00:32:28,825 --> 00:32:30,254
- Ask him to hurry up.
- Yes.

442
00:32:30,254 --> 00:32:31,254
- Don't drink anymore.
- Drink less.

443
00:32:31,254 --> 00:32:32,915
We'll leave first.

444
00:32:32,915 --> 00:32:35,344
- Hello, Mr. Xu. We'll leave first.
- Hello, Mr. Xu.

445
00:32:36,355 --> 00:32:37,544
Jiangyue.

446
00:32:37,545 --> 00:32:40,415
Why did you drink so much? Are you okay?

447
00:32:40,415 --> 00:32:41,860
I'm okay.

448
00:32:43,380 --> 00:32:44,920
Where's your girlfriend?

449
00:32:44,920 --> 00:32:46,090
Girl...

450
00:32:46,090 --> 00:32:48,489
- Slowly.
- Sorry, I'm late.

451
00:32:56,330 --> 00:32:58,580
Thank you for taking care of Jiangyue.

452
00:32:59,230 --> 00:33:01,890
This is your assistant?

453
00:33:04,810 --> 00:33:06,210
Mr. Xu?

454
00:33:06,780 --> 00:33:10,120
I am... I asked him to pick me up.

455
00:33:10,850 --> 00:33:12,589
Do you want to have some tea first before you leave?

456
00:33:12,589 --> 00:33:14,510
It's okay.

457
00:33:14,510 --> 00:33:15,929
We'll leave first.

458
00:33:15,930 --> 00:33:17,380
See you next time.

459
00:33:17,380 --> 00:33:18,469
Slowly.

460
00:33:18,469 --> 00:33:20,630
Can you even drink?

461
00:33:20,630 --> 00:33:22,250
Are you okay?

462
00:33:26,205 --> 00:33:27,925
<i>How can you drink so much?</i>

463
00:33:29,165 --> 00:33:31,505
Gu Jiaxin, let me tell you.

464
00:33:31,505 --> 00:33:33,765
I drank too much,

465
00:33:33,765 --> 00:33:37,575
take me to buy hangover medicine, send me home.

466
00:33:37,575 --> 00:33:40,495
I'll be fine after drinking three hundred milliliters of water.

467
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:42,735
Your instructions are quite clear.

468
00:33:42,735 --> 00:33:44,435
This way.

469
00:33:44,435 --> 00:33:47,755
Promise me. Give me a day off.

470
00:33:47,755 --> 00:33:49,715
What day off?

471
00:33:49,715 --> 00:33:51,474
I, Zhao Jiangyue, don't have a single day off in the whole year.

472
00:33:51,475 --> 00:33:53,245
But I'm not asking for a day off.

473
00:33:54,145 --> 00:33:55,985
You're going back on your word?

474
00:34:06,205 --> 00:34:07,775
<i>Open the door.</i>

475
00:34:07,775 --> 00:34:09,685
I'm here.

476
00:34:13,545 --> 00:34:14,905
Bed.

477
00:34:19,055 --> 00:34:20,924
Rest early, you drank too much today.

478
00:34:20,924 --> 00:34:22,104
I didn't drink too much.

479
00:34:22,104 --> 00:34:24,064
Only people who are drunk will say they are not.

480
00:34:24,064 --> 00:34:26,535
I can still walk in a straight line.

481
00:34:26,535 --> 00:34:28,005
Look.

482
00:34:29,535 --> 00:34:33,635
Look. I'm walking so well.

483
00:34:33,635 --> 00:34:35,255
- Drink with me.
- No way, no way.

484
00:34:35,255 --> 00:34:38,964
Don't leave. If you leave, I'll not give you a day off.

485
00:34:38,964 --> 00:34:40,245
Fine.

You asked me to save you today.

I heard that in every man's life,

00:42:39,364 --> 00:42:41,475
there will be two women.

594

One is a "red rose," the other is a "white rose."

595
00:42:44,595 --> 00:42:47,194
If he marries the "red rose," after some time,

596
00:42:47,195 --> 00:42:50,504
she will become "a touch of mosquito blood on the wall,"

597

while the "white rose" will remain his "shining moonlight."

If he marries the "white rose,"

she will become "a grain of rice stuck on a shirt,"

If you keep taking something to heart,

605
00:43:20,745 --> 00:43:24,664
you will only cause the other person to repeatedly remember those past events.
