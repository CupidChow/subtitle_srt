I saw your name on the wedding invitation list today.

It's the wedding of Mr. Hu's daughter. You know her?

I read from Love Note today

56
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,010
that if two unattached individuals

57

58
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:27,879

Since you've invited Ms. Zhao to attend the wedding with you,

60
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:35,060
both of you have to dress like a couple

69
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:00,629
I think you should wear a formal suit to the wedding.

70
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,090
Do you prefer blue or gray?

71

I'll make an introduction.

164
00:11:15,910 --> 00:11:17,910
This is Mr. Li, a venture capitalist.

165
00:11:17,910 --> 00:11:20,120
This is Mr. Zhao, who is in the beauty and makeup industry.

166
00:11:20,120 --> 00:11:21,809
Mr. Wang, who is in the finance industry.

167
00:11:21,809 --> 00:11:23,339
I'm Zhao Jiangyue from Link Technology.

168
00:11:23,339 --> 00:11:27,369
- Hi, Ms. Zhao.
- How do you do? Mr. Xu and Ms. Zhao look really compatible.

169
00:11:27,369 --> 00:11:28,340
You must be joking.

170
00:11:28,340 --> 00:11:30,700
Don't be shy.

171
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,549
Jiangyue is my friend and work partner.

172
00:11:33,549 --> 00:11:35,339
Please take care of her in the future.

173
00:11:35,339 --> 00:11:38,490
<i>Well-mannered, plus five points.</i>

174
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:41,120
Aren't you looking for good projects lately?

175
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:42,810
The app developed by Jiangyue is pretty good.

176
00:11:42,810 --> 00:11:44,830
You guys can find out more.

177
00:11:44,830 --> 00:11:47,570
That's right. If you're interested, we can go into more detail.

178
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,509
Sure. But today is the big day for Mr. Hu's daughter.

179
00:11:50,509 --> 00:11:52,199
Let's not talk about work today.

180
00:11:52,199 --> 00:11:54,619
When Mr. Xu is free, he can arrange a gathering for us.

181
00:11:54,619 --> 00:11:55,669
How's that?

182
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:58,679
- Isn't this what I meant?
- You're right. Let's arrange for a gathering.

183
00:11:58,679 --> 00:12:01,850
<i>Another ten points for being well-connected.</i>

184
00:12:01,850 --> 00:12:02,980
Let's take a look over there.

185
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:04,450
Okay.

186
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:22,540
<i>[Li Yanran: A bridesmaid for the first time!]</i>

187
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:30,580
<i>[Eastern Suburb No. 1 Resort Hotel]</i>

188
00:12:35,640 --> 00:12:38,499
The cakes taste horrible. Just make do with it.

189
00:12:38,499 --> 00:12:40,130
Don't be picky when you're outside.

190
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:43,429
They're not even as good as those made by the mom of my son's classmate in the equestrian class.

191
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:46,110
They look pretty ordinary.

192
00:12:46,110 --> 00:12:48,469
I saw you here together with Mr. Xu.

193
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:49,970
What are you chatting about?

194
00:12:49,970 --> 00:12:51,690
Is this Ms. Zhao?

195
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:54,619
I just heard from my husband that you are really outstanding.

196
00:12:54,619 --> 00:12:55,860
An accomplished career woman.

197
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,660
Zhao Jiangyue, you can call me Jiangyue.

198
00:12:57,700 --> 00:13:02,300
This is the first time I see Mr. Xu attending a function with his girlfriend.

199
00:13:02,379 --> 00:13:03,890
We're just friends.

200
00:13:03,890 --> 00:13:08,479
All the guys here are accompanied by their wives and prospective fiancees.

201
00:13:08,479 --> 00:13:11,399
Well, that's his hint to you. You've got to get ready.

202
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:12,879
All right, let's drop the topic.

203
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:16,779
Ms. Zhao is a smart lady and doesn't need you guys to offer advice.

204
00:13:16,779 --> 00:13:18,680
Are you going to the baking class on the weekend?

205
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:23,079
I'm not going. I need to accompany my son to his equestrian class.

206
00:13:23,079 --> 00:13:26,310
Equestrian is not the trend now. Ice hockey is getting popular.

207
00:13:26,310 --> 00:13:27,980
I would like to enroll my son, too.

208
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:31,259
We just moved to a villa area in the western suburbs.

209
00:13:31,259 --> 00:13:33,419
There's an ice hockey rink there, which is really nice.

210
00:13:33,419 --> 00:13:36,649
That club is so popular that we can't even get to register.

211
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,329
We had to be on the waiting list for two months before there was an opening.

212
00:13:39,329 --> 00:13:42,889
What can we do about this? I really want to enroll.

213
00:13:42,889 --> 00:13:45,809
Ma'am, are you referring to the Western Suburbs Hockey Club?

214
00:13:45,809 --> 00:13:47,010
That's right. Why?

215
00:13:47,010 --> 00:13:49,559
When the Ice Hockey League came to compete in China,

216
00:13:49,559 --> 00:13:52,589
I did them a small favor and was acquainted with their boss.

217
00:13:52,589 --> 00:13:56,249
- I heard their children's club is doing really well these two years.
- That's right.

218
00:13:56,249 --> 00:13:59,069
If you're interested, I can refer you.

219
00:13:59,069 --> 00:14:02,279
Of course, we're very interested. You can refer us to someone.

220
00:14:02,279 --> 00:14:03,910
- And you are...
- Sure.

221
00:14:03,910 --> 00:14:06,170
Ms. Zhao's assistant.

222
00:14:06,170 --> 00:14:09,289
I happen to know Mr. Hu's daughter, so I'm here to attend the wedding.

223
00:14:09,289 --> 00:14:12,099
Well, Jiangyue. You're really something.

224
00:14:12,099 --> 00:14:15,079
Even your assistant is so outstanding.

225
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:17,880
- Here, add me to your WeChat.
- We'll all add you to WeChat.

226
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:20,419
My son will depend on you in the future.

227
00:14:20,419 --> 00:14:23,070
Your son is not taking the equestrian class anymore?

228
00:14:32,810 --> 00:14:34,600
What's wrong with you?

229
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:36,669
Why is it so tiring being a bridesmaid?

230
00:14:36,669 --> 00:14:40,939
Since morning, I haven't had a sip of water or eaten anything.

231
00:14:43,180 --> 00:14:45,570
Why isn't Ms. Zhao with you?

232
00:14:45,570 --> 00:14:47,440
She's over there.

233
00:14:49,450 --> 00:14:51,950
He came together with you?

234
00:14:51,950 --> 00:14:54,910
It's clear he's here for Ms. Zhao.

235
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:58,839
Yanran, the wedding is about to start. Let's hurry over.

236
00:14:58,839 --> 00:15:01,279
Okay. Well, I'll go over there and help.

237
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:03,509
- Okay.
- Eat more.

238
00:15:14,450 --> 00:15:16,150
Jiangyue.

239
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,830
Mr. Xu, you're here, too?

240
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:21,290
What are you doing here?

241
00:15:21,290 --> 00:15:24,110
To attend the wedding, of course.

242
00:15:25,930 --> 00:15:27,670
Ms. Zhao.

243
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:32,109
Ms. Zhao looks really beautiful today, especially with these high heels.

244
00:15:32,109 --> 00:15:33,900
Don't you think so, Mr. Xu?

245
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,940
<i>Gu Jiaxin is so childish.</i>

246
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:38,380
<i>Deduct three points.</i>

247
00:15:38,380 --> 00:15:42,069
Jiangyue, the bride and groom are asking us to take pictures. Let's go.

248
00:15:42,069 --> 00:15:44,110
All right.

249
00:15:44,110 --> 00:15:45,840
We're going over.

250
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:53,709
Here. Three, two, one.

251
00:15:53,709 --> 00:15:55,240
Good. Smile.

252
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:57,339
Great. Okay, next.

253
00:15:57,339 --> 00:15:58,419
Mr. Xu, please.

254
00:15:58,419 --> 00:15:59,450
Congratulations.

255
00:15:59,450 --> 00:16:01,440
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

256
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:03,200
All right, look into the camera.

257
00:16:03,200 --> 00:16:04,980
Good. Smiling face.

258
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:07,690
Three, two, one.

259
00:16:09,640 --> 00:16:12,459
- Good. Next.
- Wait a minute.

260
00:16:19,450 --> 00:16:22,300
Good. Come on, look into the camera.

261
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:24,079
Come on, look here.

262
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:26,860
Three, two, one. Looks good.

263
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:29,289
Again. Three, two, one.

264
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:31,409
All right, guys. You can enter the venue now.

265
00:16:31,409 --> 00:16:32,780
Let's take a picture.

266
00:16:32,780 --> 00:16:34,979
- Let's go. Move.
- Hurry in.

267
00:16:36,450 --> 00:16:38,869
I'll send it to you tonight. Let's go in, too.

268
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:40,520
Okay.

269
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:51,650
Gu Jiaxin!

270
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:54,490
I didn't do it on purpose.

271
00:16:54,490 --> 00:16:58,500
<i>Gu Jiaxin. Point deduction. Minus 10 points.</i>

272
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:01,070
Forget it. He probably didn't mean to.

273
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:02,850
I'll get you a new one.

274
00:17:02,850 --> 00:17:04,399
No need, just go straight back.

275
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:06,560
- This is...
- Ms. Zhao.

276
00:17:06,560 --> 00:17:07,970
I'll take you there.

277
00:17:07,970 --> 00:17:10,789
Let me send you. My car is just downstairs. Let's go.

278
00:17:10,789 --> 00:17:12,130
No...

279
00:17:12,130 --> 00:17:14,000
Well, my chauffeur has arrived.

280
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:16,769
My car is just downstairs. Parking is not allowed there.

281
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,920
My chauffeur is in the car.

282
00:17:18,920 --> 00:17:21,659
Your chauffeur is not good. Slow down.

283
00:17:22,660 --> 00:17:25,100
Take... Take our car, okay?

Why did you ask me out on such short notice?

00:18:33,310 --> 00:18:37,610
You rarely ask me out on a date, so I have to speed up in getting things done.

What's the matter?

Okay, just a moment.

321
00:19:35,940 --> 00:19:40,160
<i>[Phone]
[Jingjing]</i>

322
00:19:45,500 --> 00:19:46,540
<i>[Zhang Hao]</i>

323
00:19:54,850 --> 00:19:56,710
What's the matter?

324
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,849
I just want to find out

325
00:19:59,849 --> 00:20:02,440
whether you're with that Vincent.

326
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:04,050
Is there anything else?

327
00:20:04,050 --> 00:20:06,110
I'm afraid you will be deceived.

328
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:08,990
<i>Stop shedding crocodile tears. What do you mean?</i>

329
00:20:08,990 --> 00:20:11,130
Is it time to start playing the good guy?

330
00:20:11,130 --> 00:20:13,809
<i>Don't get me wrong. I don't mean that.</i>

331
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:16,819
I just think you're overly confident at times.

332
00:20:16,819 --> 00:20:20,530
You always think that you fully understand what's going on in love relationships.

333
00:20:20,530 --> 00:20:24,429
But the quality of a person is definitely not something you can tellby his words and deeds.

334
00:20:25,270 --> 00:20:28,969
I've experienced that fully from you.

335
00:20:28,969 --> 00:20:30,109
If there's nothing else, I'm hanging up.

336
00:20:30,110 --> 00:20:33,459
<i>Didn't we say we'd go our separate ways and not disturb each other?</i>

337
00:20:42,580 --> 00:20:45,389
Sorry to keep you waiting.

338
00:20:47,490 --> 00:20:49,010
This is...

339
00:20:49,010 --> 00:20:51,310
Don't you want to open it?

340
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,250
This is a limited edition.

341
00:20:57,250 --> 00:21:01,010
Each necklace has its own code.

342
00:21:01,010 --> 00:21:03,980
I've sought the help of many people before I finally found it.

343
00:21:03,980 --> 00:21:08,360
But it had to be picked up this afternoon or it would have been sold.

344
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:13,379
So I just pushed everything aside to collect it.

345
00:21:14,470 --> 00:21:18,560
Jingjing, look at the number on the necklace.

346
00:21:20,970 --> 00:21:22,279
It's my birthday.

347
00:21:22,280 --> 00:21:24,400
This one-of-a-kind necklace...

348
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:28,519
is for you, the most unique person in this world.

349
00:21:29,920 --> 00:21:31,970
Thank you so much, Vincent.

350
00:21:31,970 --> 00:21:33,730
Let me put it on for you.

351
00:21:59,570 --> 00:22:01,190
What are you doing?

352
00:22:02,690 --> 00:22:05,869
I... I... I'm just exercising.

353
00:22:05,869 --> 00:22:07,190
Exercising?

354
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:10,230
You don't perspire when you exercise?

355
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:16,980
Well... I have underdeveloped sweat glands.

356
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:19,469
- Do you have something to say?
- Yes, I do.

357
00:22:19,969 --> 00:22:21,640
Let me teach you how to swim.

358
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:24,489
Otherwise, if you fall into the water like last time

359
00:22:24,489 --> 00:22:27,749
and I'm not by your side, what's going to happen?

360
00:22:27,749 --> 00:22:30,350
That can be really dangerous.

361
00:22:30,350 --> 00:22:33,930
Are you sure you can teach me?

362
00:22:33,930 --> 00:22:35,540
You bet.

363
00:22:40,880 --> 00:22:43,589
This Japanese restaurant has a super expensive meal

364
00:22:43,590 --> 00:22:44,979
and I actually won the lucky draw.

365
00:22:44,979 --> 00:22:46,189
Qi Heng, you are really my lucky star.

366
00:22:46,190 --> 00:22:49,209
My luck has changed for the better after being with you.

367
00:22:52,730 --> 00:22:56,999
How do you think Jiaxin and Ms. Zhao's date is going to turn out?

368
00:22:56,999 --> 00:23:00,209
Gu Jiaxin is the type of person who gets stronger with every setback.

369
00:23:00,209 --> 00:23:01,999
But I'm a little worried about my Little Aunt.

370
00:23:02,000 --> 00:23:03,259
What are you worried about?

371
00:23:03,259 --> 00:23:06,229
I wonder when she's going to realize that she likes Gu Jiaxin.

372
00:23:06,229 --> 00:23:08,749
It's already so obvious and she's the only one who can't feel it.

373
00:23:08,749 --> 00:23:11,829
Well, good things take time.

374
00:23:11,830 --> 00:23:16,029
I hope they don't miss each other for as long as we did.

375
00:23:19,060 --> 00:23:21,329
The weather is really nice, but it's a little bit too sunny.

376
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,039
It's a good day to learn to swim.

377
00:23:23,040 --> 00:23:24,580
<i>Let's play water polo later.</i>

378
00:23:24,580 --> 00:23:26,189
<i>But I'm not very good at it.</i>

379
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,559
<i>I can teach you.</i>

380
00:23:27,560 --> 00:23:29,000
<i>Sure.</i>

381
00:23:33,000 --> 00:23:34,580
<i>Throw it over.</i>

382
00:23:34,580 --> 00:23:37,960
<i>- Throw this way.
- Over here.</i>

383
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:41,519
<i>Here, bottoms up!</i>

384
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,410
<i>Coming.</i>

385
00:23:43,410 --> 00:23:44,730
<i>Cheers.</i>

386
00:23:44,730 --> 00:23:47,389
<i>- Drink up.
- Over here.</i>

387
00:23:47,389 --> 00:23:50,090
<i>Come on. Cheers.</i>

388
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,630
Master Gu, welcome.

389
00:23:52,630 --> 00:23:54,260
Jiaxin, who is this beautiful lady?

390
00:23:54,260 --> 00:23:56,329
- Introduce her to us.
- That's right.

391
00:23:56,329 --> 00:23:58,339
- Zhao Jiangyue.
- Right, address her as "Ma'am".

392
00:23:58,339 --> 00:24:00,479
- Hi, Ma'am.
- Ma'am.
- Hello, Ma'am.

393
00:24:00,479 --> 00:24:01,939
Why are you guys so insensitive?

394
00:24:01,939 --> 00:24:03,700
How can a girl like to be called "Ma'am"?

395
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:06,160
It's okay, I don't mind.

396
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:08,409
- Let's go have fun.
- No... don't...

397
00:24:08,409 --> 00:24:10,069
Let's go, since you guys are here.

398
00:24:10,069 --> 00:24:12,079
Move on. Join us.

399
00:24:12,079 --> 00:24:13,700
It's fine. Go on.

400
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:16,699
<i>- Catch it.
- Over there.</i>

401
00:24:16,699 --> 00:24:17,980
How is it?

402
00:24:17,980 --> 00:24:19,250
<i>Good shot!</i>

403
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:20,850
What do you think?

404
00:24:25,640 --> 00:24:29,840
Is this your idea of teaching me how to swim?

405
00:24:29,840 --> 00:24:32,009
No, my bad for the poor planning.

406
00:24:32,009 --> 00:24:34,000
I didn't expect this.

407
00:24:34,000 --> 00:24:36,810
It's bustling over here.

408
00:24:36,810 --> 00:24:38,640
Start teaching.

409
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:42,920
- I...
- Fine. Come on, Let's go. Walk.

Let's get out of here.

437
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:35,169
Hey, add me to your WeChat. Do join us again.

438
00:26:35,169 --> 00:26:39,049
I'll add you to the group chat and we can hang out together.

439
00:26:39,049 --> 00:26:40,430
Sure.

440
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:44,559
- Don't add them.
- Okay.

441
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:46,859
- Are there many people in the group?
- Well, dozens of people.

442
00:26:46,859 --> 00:26:48,370
Dozens of people.

443
00:26:50,190 --> 00:26:51,529
Are you guys dating anyone?

444
00:26:51,529 --> 00:26:53,719
- No, not yet.
- We just broke up

445
00:26:53,719 --> 00:26:55,280
That's great.

446
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:58,220
Well, our company has developed an app,

447
00:26:58,220 --> 00:27:00,020
<i>[Love Note]</i>
Love Note. This is the one.

448
00:27:00,020 --> 00:27:03,099
If you want to start dating, you can download this app.

449
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:05,090
If you sign up, I can give you

450
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,220
a free three-month membership.

451
00:27:07,220 --> 00:27:08,709
Help me to promote this in the group chat.

452
00:27:08,710 --> 00:27:10,279
Okay, sure.

453
00:27:10,280 --> 00:27:13,209
- Add me into the group chat. Thank you.
- Sure.

454
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:15,929
They're hitting on you and you promote your app to them.

455
00:27:15,929 --> 00:27:17,910
Opportunities are everywhere.

456
00:27:17,910 --> 00:27:19,510
You have to learn this.

457
00:27:19,510 --> 00:27:21,690
Jiaxin!

458
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:23,010
Why are you leaving?

459
00:27:23,010 --> 00:27:25,429
I also want to ask when you're going back for the competition.

460
00:27:25,429 --> 00:27:26,900
You can't just give up.

461
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:29,759
No way. I'll go back after the domestic competition.

462
00:27:29,759 --> 00:27:32,099
Then if you want to go back, stay a little longer today.

463
00:27:32,099 --> 00:27:33,499
- Stay with us.
- That's right. Come on.

464
00:27:33,499 --> 00:27:35,279
No, don't. I'm sending Jiangyue back.

465
00:27:35,280 --> 00:27:38,429
- Then, she can join us and stay for a while more. Right.
- Come on.

466
00:27:38,429 --> 00:27:39,989
It's okay. I'm good. You guys go ahead.

467
00:27:39,989 --> 00:27:41,799
- I can go back on my own.
- Let me send you back.

468
00:27:41,799 --> 00:27:43,039
It's fine. You guys carry on.

469
00:27:43,040 --> 00:27:44,559
It's all right. Enjoy yourselves.

470
00:27:44,560 --> 00:27:46,909
- Bye.
- Jiaxin, stay for a while more.

471
00:27:46,909 --> 00:27:48,860
Jiangyue.

472
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:51,519
<i>Gu Jiaxin only knows how to have fun.</i>

473
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,350
<i>Deduct twenty points.</i>

474
00:27:55,230 --> 00:27:56,850
Let's drink.

475
00:28:03,920 --> 00:28:06,679
The big meal today is really worth our trip down.

476
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,319

I have to leave no matter what. Pass me the crutches.

638
00:37:58,280 --> 00:37:59,750
Oh... crutches.

639
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:06,530
Be careful.

640
00:38:09,560 --> 00:38:11,080
Which farm?

641
00:38:23,190 --> 00:38:24,820
Sir, thanks.

642
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,400
Is this the place?

643
00:38:33,710 --> 00:38:36,230
This should be the back door of the farm.

644
00:38:36,230 --> 00:38:37,869
How did we get here?

645
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:40,499
Sir, it doesn't seem to be here.

646
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:42,710
Sir!

647
00:38:55,040 --> 00:38:56,850
Since I'm here...

648
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:26,460
<i>[Relationship Scorecard]</i>

649
00:39:31,220 --> 00:39:34,920
[Social networking: 8, Social activity participation: 9, Be of help to my work: 2, Emotional feedback to me: 1]

650
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,799
Being in a relationship may not be an exam,

651
00:39:37,800 --> 00:39:41,239
but in fact, everyone has a steelyard in their hearts

652
00:39:41,239 --> 00:39:43,429
that silently evaluates their partners.

653
00:39:43,430 --> 00:39:45,229
Whether he cares about you,

654
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:46,909
what you value most about him,

655
00:39:46,910 --> 00:39:48,519
as well as his personality.

656
00:39:48,520 --> 00:39:51,390
If you add a score to these,

657
00:39:51,390 --> 00:39:54,319
you are actually evaluating your relationship.

658
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:56,939
Some score high for being mature and stable.

659
00:39:56,939 --> 00:39:59,229
Some people are clumsily in love with you,

660
00:39:59,230 --> 00:40:01,949
but they lose points unconsciously.

661
00:40:01,950 --> 00:40:03,519
If you meet someone

662
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:05,079
and despite his low grade,

663
00:40:05,080 --> 00:40:07,469
you're still attracted to him,

664
00:40:07,470 --> 00:40:11,159
then follow your heart at this point.

665
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,850
After all, there is nothing wrong

666
00:40:19,850 --> 00:40:22,130
with being in a relationship happily.
