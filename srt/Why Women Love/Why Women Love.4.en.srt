198

Later, he was sent abroad by the company.

199

That's all.

Come with me.

347
00:23:19,175 --> 00:23:21,095
I have a question.

348
00:23:21,095 --> 00:23:22,885
Was that statement credible to you?

349
00:23:22,885 --> 00:23:24,084
What do you mean?

350
00:23:24,084 --> 00:23:27,165
Jingjing is not just the poster of our company,

351
00:23:27,165 --> 00:23:29,485
she is also my best friend.

352
00:23:29,485 --> 00:23:31,405
I worry about her.

353
00:23:31,405 --> 00:23:33,285

Sweets.

356
00:23:48,225 --> 00:23:51,595
Firstly, no matter if Zhang Hao cheated or not,

357
00:23:51,595 --> 00:23:54,285
people believed Qian Jingjing's words.

358
00:23:54,285 --> 00:23:56,855
And "Love Note" got attention because of it.

359
00:23:56,855 --> 00:23:58,605
I consider that a good thing.

360
00:23:58,605 --> 00:24:00,994
As for the truth, whether they are okay,

361
00:24:00,994 --> 00:24:03,175
you can ask her directly.

362
00:24:07,395 --> 00:24:09,105
Don't worry.

363
00:24:09,105 --> 00:24:11,534
Jingjing is beautiful and feminine.

364
00:24:11,534 --> 00:24:13,695
I believe in her charm.

365
00:24:14,445 --> 00:24:17,295
Right. She'll come for filming next week.

366

If you worry about her, you can ask her then.

Your boyfriend is the owner of Link Technology?

His mother is the chairman of the company.

Isn't it easy for me to know where you live?

412

You cannot escape from me.

Wait! Why are you back?

414
00:28:12,485 --> 00:28:15,574
I came back to have fun with you. It was boring without you.

415
00:28:15,574 --> 00:28:17,415
I don't have time for you. I'm busy.

416

I know.

417

Ms. Jin told me that you are working hard at the company.

418

Why did you want to live alone?

423
00:28:39,584 --> 00:28:41,934
This place doesn't seem to be convenient.

In order to see you,

437
00:29:21,984 --> 00:29:24,124
I didn't have time to eat anything.

438
00:29:24,124 --> 00:29:26,525
I'm so hungry now.

439

Once some ladies fall in love,

they let the other person take control

497

Don't worry, Jiangyue.

If I don't announce the divorce within six months,

557
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:42,294
it won't count as a breach of being the poster of "Love Note."

558
00:36:42,294 --> 00:36:43,905
Instead of that,

559

<i>[Love Note: The theory of 60% destiny]</i>

582
00:38:17,507 --> 00:38:20,684
Under many circumstances, we'll consider someone is not really bad.

583
00:38:20,684 --> 00:38:23,915
We feel that they are nice and think that he or she might be a good partner.

584
00:38:23,915 --> 00:38:27,534
But when it comes to pursuing, you don't really feel like it.

585
00:38:27,534 --> 00:38:29,994
When we set terminating singlehood as the final goal,

586
00:38:29,994 --> 00:38:32,134
and the requirements for the other half become not so strict,

587
00:38:32,134 --> 00:38:35,334
then our type will no longer be one person.

588
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,234
It will be a group of persons, instead.

589
00:38:37,234 --> 00:38:41,724
This is the so-called transient "The theory of 60% destiny."

590
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:45,694
In this case, when we lack the motivation to pursue someone proactively,

591
00:38:45,694 --> 00:38:50,164
what we need to do is turn the 60% into 100%.

592
00:38:50,164 --> 00:38:52,954
Increase the chance of the other person making a move first.

593
00:38:52,954 --> 00:38:56,504
Firstly, do your skincare, enhance self-confidence.

594
00:38:56,504 --> 00:38:59,054
Be aware that no matter how we look,

595
00:38:59,054 --> 00:39:03,285
confidence is the reason that a person shines.

596
00:39:03,285 --> 00:39:06,474
Secondly, do your time management.

597
00:39:06,474 --> 00:39:07,774
Manage your time.

598
00:39:07,774 --> 00:39:11,615
Make some room for your potential dates.

599
00:39:11,615 --> 00:39:13,974
Thirdly, no more fantasy.

600
00:39:13,974 --> 00:39:15,784
Accept the other person's imperfection.

601
00:39:15,784 --> 00:39:18,415
Agree to disagree. Learn how to get along.

602
