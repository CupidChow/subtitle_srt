My new roommate, Qi Heng, do you know him well?

We went to the same university. We're very close.

74
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:27,080
He used to help me with my homework.

75
00:05:27,080 --> 00:05:30,970
So is he... still single?

76
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:36,400
Why are you suddenly interested in Qi Heng?

77
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:38,620
Nothing.

78
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,999
I'm thinking, since we are roommates now,

79
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:44,639
if he has a girlfriend, I don't want her to misunderstand.

80
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:46,050
No, he doesn't.

81
00:05:46,050 --> 00:05:49,759
Qi Heng... I've never seen him having one.

82
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,920
But I heard he's had a crush for a long time.

83
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,850
As for who she is,

84

00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:01,660

92
00:06:18,710 --> 00:06:20,640
Nonsense.

93
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:25,149

- Aren't you two okay?

94

But I can tell she was upset.

98
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:36,620
I think you pissed her off in some way.

99
00:06:36,620 --> 00:06:39,380
Who has the courage to piss her off?

100
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:44,060

101
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,490

Wait. Let me get this straight.

108
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,890
You went to attend a wedding.

109
00:07:13,890 --> 00:07:16,140
And you saw Xu Ningyuan there with a girl.

110
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:19,099
So you asked Gu Jiaxin to pretend to be your boyfriend.

111
00:07:19,099 --> 00:07:20,660
And then he made you drink too much.

112
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:23,939
- You slept together.
- He didn't make me drink.

113
00:07:23,939 --> 00:07:25,380
I wanted to drink myself.

114
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:27,170
Why were you drunk?

115
00:07:27,170 --> 00:07:30,020
I'm telling you, don't underestimate men.

116
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:33,109
Some may look decent, but who knows what's on their mind?

117
00:07:33,109 --> 00:07:34,520
Look at me.

118
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:36,830
I know everything about love.

119
00:07:36,830 --> 00:07:40,039
But eventually, I fell for Zhang Hao's fake characteristics.

120
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:43,139
Someone so innocent in love like you

121
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:46,840
should be careful with a playboy's tricks.

122
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:49,850
I'll never drink with guys alone.

123
00:07:49,850 --> 00:07:51,620
Especially the cute ones.

124
00:07:51,620 --> 00:07:56,009
Was he being cute the reason that you drank and slept with him?

125
00:07:56,009 --> 00:07:58,440
Do you have any feelings for Gu Jiaxin?

126
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:00,310
No.

127
00:08:00,310 --> 00:08:01,949
Don't deny just yet.

128
00:08:01,950 --> 00:08:05,049
Women sometimes don't know their own hearts either.

129
00:08:05,049 --> 00:08:08,360
Even if you have feelings for him, it's not strange.

130
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:13,069
Think about it. When you're upset, a cute younger guy comes

131
00:08:13,069 --> 00:08:15,599
to you and comfort you.

132
00:08:15,600 --> 00:08:17,049
Lonely man and woman.

133
00:08:17,049 --> 00:08:19,159
It's nothing but normal for something to happen.

134
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,240
I told you, there was not.

135
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:23,690
I don't have any feelings for him.

136
00:08:23,690 --> 00:08:26,609
He is so much younger than me. That's impossible.

137
00:08:26,609 --> 00:08:29,370
I also don't think Gu Jiaxin is a good choice for you.

138
00:08:29,370 --> 00:08:32,830
Xu Ningyuan is the one worth fighting for.

139
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,469
He brought a girl to the wedding.

140
00:08:34,470 --> 00:08:36,540
It doesn't mean she was his girlfriend.

141
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,769
You better clear that up first.

love is a beautiful thing.

Kang Zhe, how are you today?

168
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,000
Is it really okay to live on the nutrient solution?

169
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:41,200
When can we be like before again?

170
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:43,600
Drinking, feasting, and dreaming.

171
00:10:57,700 --> 00:11:00,400
Do you remember the female devil I told you about last time?

172
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
I thought she was a machine that only cared about work.

173
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,400
But later I saw more different sides of her.

174
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:11,400
She could be fierce sometimes,

175
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
but also silly and cute.

176
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,400
Especially when I saw her weakness...

177
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,300
<i>It's been so long.</i>

178
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:23,600
I felt for her.

179
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,400
Do you think I have feelings for her?

180
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,000
No. No.

181
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,400
She is eight years older than me.

182
00:11:36,400 --> 00:11:38,600
She is not my type at all.

183
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,500
Right?

184
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:48,800
Also, Qi Heng came back.

185
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:51,600
I can't believe he came back for a girl.

186
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,400
My god. I don't believe it.

187
00:11:53,400 --> 00:11:55,200
He even played pranks with me the other day.

188
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,800
I wanted to kill him.

189
00:11:57,600 --> 00:11:59,800
I'm telling you, you are the missing one.

Welcome, my new roommate.

197
00:12:19,800 --> 00:12:21,500
We-Welcome.

198
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,400
Duoxi, you haven't changed a bit.

199
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,400
Still the same as before.

200
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,100
You meant, I didn't make any progress all these years?

201
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:40,500
No-no. I-I... I didn't mean that. I...

202
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,400
Relax. I'm kidding.

203
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,000
But you've really changed a lot.

204
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:46,600
You were about this tall.

205
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:48,200
Now you are so tall.

206
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,500
I barely recognized you.

207
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:52,200
I grew taller suddenly.

208
00:12:52,200 --> 00:12:55,800
Right, why did you suddenly transfer to another school?

209
00:12:55,800 --> 00:12:58,900
Actually, it was because of my parents' work.

210
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,600
I didn't want to transfer either.

211
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:02,300
Why not?

212
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,000
I know.

213
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:07,500
Did you have a crush on our class belle?

214
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:09,400
I remembered during our Setting-up Exercise,

215
00:13:09,400 --> 00:13:11,400
you would turn around whenever you had a chance.

216
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:12,400
You must've been peeking on the belle.

217
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,700
- No-no-no.
- You're blushing.

218
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:17,000
We know each other so well, why are you so shy?

219
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,400
Today, you can have all the Guangliang wine.

220
00:13:19,400 --> 00:13:21,800
Tell me the truth.

221
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:25,000
No, I wasn't looking at her.

222
00:13:25,000 --> 00:13:26,600
Then who?

223
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,100
I won't tell you.

224
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:30,600
Petty.

225
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,000
Whatever.

226
00:13:32,900 --> 00:13:34,400
I noticed you can speak very fluently now.

227
00:13:34,400 --> 00:13:36,000
I'm so not used to it.

228
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:38,700
Do you still remember? When the language teacher asked you to recite articles,

229
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,800
you were always stuttering.

230

<i>Qi Xiaohu,</i>

254
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:52,400
<i>after class, let's practice together.</i>

255
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,800
By the riverbank, lush reeds grow, covered in dew, white as snow.

256
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,200
The beauty I want to know, is somewhere along with the river flow.

257
00:15:17,200 --> 00:15:21,800
Wading against the running water, along a tough and windy path I go.

258
00:15:21,800 --> 00:15:26,000
Swimming down the river flow, I find her right in the middle.

259
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:30,400
Impressive. You still remember that.

260
00:15:30,400 --> 00:15:32,400
All thanks to you.

261
00:15:32,400 --> 00:15:37,400
After class, during classes, even after school,

262
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,800
you made me read it nonstop. And wouldn't let me go if I wasn't fluent.

263
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:42,800
The memory is too deep.

264
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,900
It's carved in my mind and can't be forgotten.

265
00:15:44,900 --> 00:15:49,700
I was so bossy back in school?

266
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:51,200
Thanks to you being bossy.

267
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:55,100
Because of it, I'm no longer stuttering or hesitant.

268
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,100
Then shouldn't you thank me?

269
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:00,500
Surely I should. I have great gratitude for you.

270
00:16:00,500 --> 00:16:02,200
That's not enough.

271
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:06,000
I think you should pay the bill today.

272
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:08,600
Okay. I'll take care of our food from now on.

273
00:16:08,600 --> 00:16:10,100
I'm joking with you.

274
00:16:10,100 --> 00:16:13,000
This is my territory. How can I let you pay?

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:15,800
This meal is on me. It's the reception banquet I specially set up for you.

276
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:18,500
Thank you, Qi Heng, for sharing my rent.

277
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:21,000
- Suit yourself. Don't hesitate.
- Thanks for the hospitality.

278
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,500
Let's make a toast.

279
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:31,000
Hurry, before it turns cold.

280
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,000
Ms. Jin, morning.

281
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,000
Morning.

282
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:46,300
Do you still start work half an hour early?

283
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:49,100
Clearer mind in the morning. More efficient.

284
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:50,800
This is an excellent client.

285
00:16:50,800 --> 00:16:53,100
He wants to talk about the cooperation with Love Note.

286
00:16:53,100 --> 00:16:54,500
You can talk to him in private.

287
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:56,600
- See if he is interested.
- Okay.

288
00:16:56,600 --> 00:16:57,700
Sit down, please.

289
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,500
How is Jiaxin lately?

290
00:16:59,500 --> 00:17:01,800
Pretty good. He's quite positive at work.

291
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:05,100
I heard that you two live in the same building.

292
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,600
Yes. Very coincidental.

293
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:11,000
We are upstairs and downstairs.

294
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:13,200
He doesn't want to live at home.

295
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,500
Please discipline him when needed.

296
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:17,200
Don't let him stray too far away.

297
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:20,700
- No problem. I'll be strict with him about work.
- Thank you.

298
00:17:20,700 --> 00:17:22,900
Sure thing. That's my job.

299
00:17:22,900 --> 00:17:25,000
Ms. Jin, the teleconference is ready.

300
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,000
Okay.

301
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,300
Ms. Jin, I'll leave you to it then.

302
00:17:29,100 --> 00:17:30,500
Also,

303
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:34,800
Jiaxin's girlfriend is back.

304
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,800
They basically grew up together.

305
00:17:36,800 --> 00:17:38,300
Both of them like having fun.

306
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,300
If Jiaxin wants to have a day off, you can approve accordingly.

307
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:44,300
Let them connect.

308
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,600
Okay.

309
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:54,000
Ms. Zhao.

310
00:17:58,000 --> 00:17:59,600
Ms. Zhao.

311
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:16,000
<i>Zhao Jiangyue, what are you thinking?</i>

312
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:18,400
<i>Isn't it normal that he has a girlfriend?</i>

313
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,500
<i>What's wrong with you? Are you crazy?</i>

314
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,000
<i>Come back to work.</i>

315
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,000
<i>Stop thinking about it.</i>

316
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:33,200
Ms. Zhao, good morning.

317
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,800
Why didn't you knock?

318
00:18:34,800 --> 00:18:36,400
What for?

319
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:38,000
It's complicated.

320
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,100
Coffee is on me. Have a great day.

321
00:18:42,200 --> 00:18:43,600
Why are you late?

322
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,900
I'm not. Right on time.

323
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:51,500
Wait. What? Upset?

324
00:18:51,500 --> 00:18:54,600
Who upset you? I'll beat that person for you.

325
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,600
Don't joke at the company.

326
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,300
We work here.

327
00:18:59,300 --> 00:19:01,000
Wait! What's wrong with you?

328
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,000
Come on. Did someone upset you?

329
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:05,200
This is not like you.

330
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:08,200
I'm not in the mood. Leave me.

331
00:19:09,400 --> 00:19:11,400
Come back.

332
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,600
Any instructions?

333
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,300
This an important client of the company.

334
00:19:15,300 --> 00:19:19,800
Sort out his information, and report to me the key points.

335
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,600
Okay.

336
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:27,900
Him.

337
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:31,800
Who?

338
00:19:39,100 --> 00:19:41,600
<i>[Client Profile. Xu Ningyuan]</i>

339
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,300
You guys are really fateful.

340
00:19:44,300 --> 00:19:46,200
Great chance.

341
00:19:46,200 --> 00:19:48,300
If you miss this chance again, it will be over for you.

342
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,900
Get out!

343
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,000
Fine.

344
00:19:53,000 --> 00:19:55,900
I'll let you carefully analyze your client.

345
00:20:08,185 --> 00:20:10,275
<i>They are so fated.</i>

346
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:13,134
<i>Then I'll be a good person, and help them out.</i>

347
00:20:13,135 --> 00:20:16,624
<i>Save myself some useless thoughts and stop looking for problems.</i>

348
00:20:21,770 --> 00:20:23,355
<i>[Qi Xiaohu]</i>

349
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:26,085
<i>Hi, Qi Heng.</i>

350
00:20:26,085 --> 00:20:28,094
Duoxi, did you eat yet?

351
00:20:28,095 --> 00:20:30,484
I did, Little Aunt asked me to bring lunch for her.

352
00:20:30,484 --> 00:20:32,004
<i>I'm on my way to the company.</i>

353
00:20:32,004 --> 00:20:35,045
Did Gu Jiaxin ask you to run errands again?

354
00:20:35,045 --> 00:20:37,844
- I'll talk to him.
- No, no.

355
00:20:37,844 --> 00:20:39,164
Not Gu Jiaxin.

356
00:20:39,164 --> 00:20:41,024
My Little Aunt is ignoring him lately.

357
00:20:41,025 --> 00:20:43,435
<i>So she asked to do it instead.</i>

358
00:20:43,435 --> 00:20:46,294
- What happened?
- No idea.

359
00:20:46,294 --> 00:20:49,150
Maybe my Little Aunt's standard was too high,

360
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,700
<i>and Gu Jiaxin was lazy. It's okay. They'll work it out in a few days.</i>

361
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,525
What do you want for dinner?

362
00:20:54,525 --> 00:20:56,195
Tonight?

363
00:20:56,195 --> 00:20:58,925
<i>Shouldn't I prepare dinner today?</i>

364
00:20:58,925 --> 00:21:01,664
I might get off work early today. Let me do it.

365
00:21:01,664 --> 00:21:03,584
Really? That's great.

366
00:21:03,585 --> 00:21:04,520
Then you decide,

367
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,040
<i>I love everything. I'm not faddy.</i>

368
00:21:06,044 --> 00:21:08,565
Okay. Come back earlier.

369
00:21:08,565 --> 00:21:10,110
<i>Bye.</i>

370
00:21:21,765 --> 00:21:23,735
Come in.

371
00:21:23,735 --> 00:21:26,875
Ms. Zhao! Here's your lunch.

372
00:21:26,875 --> 00:21:29,585
Thank you. Any plans tonight?

373
00:21:29,585 --> 00:21:32,025
- Let the three of us get together.
- Huh? Oh.

374
00:21:32,025 --> 00:21:33,375
To comfort Jingjing?

375
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,765
Sort of.

376
00:21:34,765 --> 00:21:35,995
And talk about some other things.

377
00:21:35,995 --> 00:21:39,294
I can't today. Rain check?

378
00:21:39,294 --> 00:21:41,305
I have plans.

379
00:21:41,305 --> 00:21:43,785
You seem busy lately.

380
00:21:43,785 --> 00:21:47,024
- Doing what?
- I found a new roommate.

381
00:21:47,024 --> 00:21:49,235
We're getting to know each other.

382
00:21:49,235 --> 00:21:50,835
I didn't get the chance to ask,

383
00:21:50,835 --> 00:21:52,664
why did you find a male roommate?

384
00:21:52,665 --> 00:21:53,974
He was my high school classmate.

385
00:21:53,975 --> 00:21:55,784
And he went to the same university as Jiaxin did.

386
00:21:55,785 --> 00:21:58,534
Very reliable returnee elite, nothing to be worried about.

387
00:21:58,534 --> 00:22:00,664
- Okay. Take care of yourself.
- I'm going.

388
00:22:00,664 --> 00:22:02,275
Good luck to you too. Find love soon.

389
00:22:02,275 --> 00:22:04,555
Sweet love awaits.

390
00:22:12,325 --> 00:22:16,105
Let's get together tonight. Girls only.

391
00:22:31,425 --> 00:22:33,635
You and Xu Ningyuan will work together?

392
00:22:33,635 --> 00:22:36,925
Honestly, you guys were meant for each other.

393
00:22:36,925 --> 00:22:39,184
I don't know how to face him now.

394
00:22:39,185 --> 00:22:43,785
Do you still like him like before?

395
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:45,374
What can like do?

396
00:22:45,375 --> 00:22:47,685
He took his girlfriend to the wedding.

397
00:22:47,685 --> 00:22:51,145
He told you that was his girl?

398
00:22:51,145 --> 00:22:53,064
He didn't. I guessed.

399
00:22:53,065 --> 00:22:55,734
Look at you. Resolute in work.

400
00:22:55,734 --> 00:23:00,024
But whenever you need to make moves in love, you get cold feet.

401
00:23:04,875 --> 00:23:09,264
- What are you doing?
- I am asking him directly.

402
00:23:09,264 --> 00:23:12,404
<i>Ningyuan, it's been a while since you came back. I never bought you dinner.</i>

403
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,654
<i>Are you free tomorrow evening? Do you want to hang out?</i>

404
00:23:14,654 --> 00:23:16,284
- Wait. No. No.
- Stop.

405
00:23:16,284 --> 00:23:17,664
- Wait.
- No.

406
00:23:17,664 --> 00:23:19,555
It's sent.

407
00:23:19,555 --> 00:23:21,555
Ningyuan?

408
00:23:21,555 --> 00:23:24,024
I normally call him "Mr. Xu"!

409
00:23:24,025 --> 00:23:25,574
Amateur.

410
00:23:25,574 --> 00:23:28,764
Sudden intimate nicknames will drop him a hint,

411
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,334
and make him wonder.

412
00:23:30,335 --> 00:23:32,105
Oh lord.

413
00:23:36,275 --> 00:23:38,105
<i>It's rare for you to invite me to dinner.</i>

414
00:23:38,105 --> 00:23:40,610
<i>It's not for work, is it?</i>

415
00:23:41,365 --> 00:23:44,094
- What should I do? What should I do?
- Don't panic.

416
00:23:44,094 --> 00:23:46,254
Tell him it's a personal date.

417
00:23:46,255 --> 00:23:48,064
Work is just an embellishment.

418
00:23:48,065 --> 00:23:50,974
This is not how I usually talk.

419
00:23:50,975 --> 00:23:52,705
He'll find it strange.

420
00:23:52,705 --> 00:23:54,554
That's the idea.

421
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,454
Men were born to be hunters.

422
00:23:56,455 --> 00:23:59,484
They like challenges, you need to make him wonder.

423
00:23:59,484 --> 00:24:02,985
Then he'll look forward to the date even more.

424
00:24:02,985 --> 00:24:04,635
<i>Private date.</i>

425
00:24:04,635 --> 00:24:06,985
<i>Work is just an embellishment.</i>

426
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:10,184
<i>Sure thing.</i>

427
00:24:10,185 --> 00:24:11,734
<i>I'll make a reservation.</i>

428
00:24:11,735 --> 00:24:13,255
<i>See you.</i>

429
00:24:14,865 --> 00:24:19,025
I think this thing is really happening.

430
00:24:34,670 --> 00:24:36,720
<i>[Clingy Girl]</i>

431
00:24:43,205 --> 00:24:47,154
- What now?
- Jiaxin, where are you?

432
00:24:47,154 --> 00:24:50,094
- Where are you?
- Are you coming to me?

433
00:24:50,094 --> 00:24:51,824
<i>No, no, no. I'm busy.</i>

434
00:24:51,825 --> 00:24:54,085
- Then I'll come to you.
- I'm not home.

435
00:24:54,085 --> 00:24:56,164
Liar. The light of your place is on.

436
00:24:56,164 --> 00:24:57,474
Wait! Where are you really?

437
00:24:57,474 --> 00:24:59,775
<i>Come to the window, and look downstairs.</i>

438
00:24:59,775 --> 00:25:01,725
<i>Then you'll see me.</i>

439
00:25:06,215 --> 00:25:08,824
<i>I'm not home. Why did you go to my place?</i>

440
00:25:08,825 --> 00:25:11,614
<i>I baked a cake for the first time in the baking class today.</i>

441
00:25:11,615 --> 00:25:14,005
I brought it to you, so you can try it.

442
00:25:14,005 --> 00:25:15,824
<i>Wait for me. I'm coming up.</i>

443
00:25:15,825 --> 00:25:17,245
Hello.

444
00:25:19,115 --> 00:25:22,095
What? What connection is this?

445
00:25:36,375 --> 00:25:39,705
Be careful on your way home. Let me know when you arrive.

446
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:42,075
Don't worry.

447
00:25:42,075 --> 00:25:43,825
Who is it?

448
00:25:46,665 --> 00:25:48,385
Evening, Jingjing.

449
00:25:48,385 --> 00:25:52,825
You came to Jiangyue to talk about work this late?

450
00:25:54,725 --> 00:25:57,785
Right. Work.

451
00:25:57,785 --> 00:25:59,664
All right, you guys talk.

452
00:25:59,664 --> 00:26:03,264
I'll leave you alone. Oh, prepare for your date tomorrow thoroughly.

453
00:26:03,264 --> 00:26:04,544
- Good luck.
- Bye.

454
00:26:04,544 --> 00:26:06,884
- Goodbye.
- Bye-bye.

455
00:26:09,805 --> 00:26:11,325
Hurry.

456
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:15,124
- What's this?
- Let me take refuge here.

457
00:26:15,124 --> 00:26:17,625
A sister who grew up with me came to find me.

458
00:26:17,625 --> 00:26:19,115
She's very clingy.

459
00:26:19,115 --> 00:26:20,935
I can only avoid her.

460
00:26:20,935 --> 00:26:23,784
Look. I wasn't lying.
<i>[Clingy Girl]</i>

461
00:26:30,725 --> 00:26:34,035
Did you cheat a young girl's feelings out there?

462
00:26:34,035 --> 00:26:36,145
Now she has come to find you?

463
00:26:37,425 --> 00:26:39,544
I don't have enough opportunities to avoid her.

464
00:26:39,545 --> 00:26:40,825
I'll only stay a short while.

465
00:26:40,825 --> 00:26:42,805
Once she leaves, I'll leave.

466
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:47,725
Fine.

467
00:26:47,725 --> 00:26:49,135
Sit.

468
00:26:51,635 --> 00:26:54,035
Look here.

469
00:26:54,035 --> 00:26:56,235
You have the time of a song.

470
00:26:58,455 --> 00:26:59,725
Sit.

471
00:27:09,215 --> 00:27:10,900
Jiaxin.

472
00:27:11,885 --> 00:27:13,975
Jiaxin.

473
00:27:15,305 --> 00:27:18,035
You're dead if I catch you.

474
00:27:22,985 --> 00:27:24,845
What was it?

475
00:27:37,325 --> 00:27:39,215
Jiaxin.

476
00:27:41,025 --> 00:27:43,135
He's really not here.

477
00:27:59,275 --> 00:28:01,755
He doesn't pick up my phone.

478
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:05,115
<i>The game is still on.</i>

479
00:28:05,115 --> 00:28:06,424
<i>Bad boy.</i>

480
00:28:06,425 --> 00:28:08,285
<i>You avoided me on purpose.</i>

481
00:28:08,285 --> 00:28:10,235
<i>I'll spare you this time.</i>

482
00:28:10,235 --> 00:28:13,245
<i>Wait for my big surprise.</i>

483
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:31,344
- Is she gone?
- Yes. Yes.

484
00:28:31,344 --> 00:28:33,235
Then so can you.

485
00:28:35,155 --> 00:28:37,415
Going on a date tomorrow?

486
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,065
With whom?

487
00:28:39,065 --> 00:28:40,555
Xu Ningyuan?

488
00:28:40,555 --> 00:28:42,015
Yeah.

489
00:28:42,015 --> 00:28:44,215
Okay, let me tell you...

490
00:28:47,565 --> 00:28:49,605
Wait.

491
00:28:49,605 --> 00:28:51,765
You need to prepare for it.

492
00:28:51,765 --> 00:28:53,455
Prepare what?

493
00:28:53,455 --> 00:28:56,924
Such a good chance, you need to take it. You know that?

494
00:28:56,924 --> 00:28:59,275
Isn't he the one you care about the most?

495
00:28:59,275 --> 00:29:01,555
Otherwise, you wouldn't have been so drunk last time.

496
00:29:01,555 --> 00:29:03,985
Last time,

497
00:29:03,985 --> 00:29:07,114
they all wanted to drink with me, I had no choice.

498
00:29:08,905 --> 00:29:11,555
As I see it, you are

499
00:29:11,555 --> 00:29:13,205
just being stubborn.

500
00:29:14,215 --> 00:29:15,925
How about this?

501
00:29:15,925 --> 00:29:19,335
For the sake of you saving me today,

502
00:29:19,335 --> 00:29:22,845
I'll give you a dating crash course.

503
00:29:28,255 --> 00:29:30,675
What are you doing?

504
00:29:30,675 --> 00:29:32,515
Simulating the scene.

505
00:29:41,335 --> 00:29:43,824
Here, let's imagine

506
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:45,995
that we're at a restaurant.

507
00:29:47,965 --> 00:29:51,255
Now, I am you. And you're Xu Ningyuan.

508
00:29:51,255 --> 00:29:54,295
Here's the menu. Take it.

509
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,700
So? Any feelings?

510
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,600
Fingers.

511
00:30:40,600 --> 00:30:42,800
I touched your fingers.

512
00:30:42,800 --> 00:30:44,400
Nothing.

513
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,100
This is called the Heartbeat Touch Law.

514
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:55,000
Use skin contacts properly.

515
00:30:55,000 --> 00:30:56,200
Too much is too little.

516
00:30:56,200 --> 00:30:59,400
This law is especially effective with men.

517
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:01,200
According to you,

518
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,300
handing a menu could attract people.

519
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:05,700
Then everyone should love the waiters.

520
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:07,900
Don't evade the crucial point.

521
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:09,900
I get it.

522
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:13,800
Mr. Xu may not like skin contact with females.

523
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:18,200
But if you can subtly create some chances,

524
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:20,400
he'll get used to it

525
00:31:20,400 --> 00:31:22,100
and fall for you.

526
00:31:22,800 --> 00:31:25,300
- Is it really so magical?
- It is.

527
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,800
What are you doing?

528
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:46,400
There was something. I've taken it away.

529
00:31:46,400 --> 00:31:50,200
Ears are one of the most sensitive parts of the human body.

530
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,800
Make an excuse.

531
00:31:51,800 --> 00:31:54,000
Touch him inadvertently.

532
00:31:54,000 --> 00:31:57,600
It'll also make him blush and give him a fast heartbeat.

533
00:32:02,700 --> 00:32:04,200
It was quite intentional.

534
00:32:04,200 --> 00:32:05,800
It depends on your performance.

535
00:32:05,800 --> 00:32:08,500
If you do anything wrong, just say another excuse.

536
00:32:08,500 --> 00:32:10,400
I can't do it.

537
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:12,000
What time is it?

538
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,900
11:00. Go back to bed.

539
00:32:29,400 --> 00:32:33,800
Well... I-I think you are quite gifted.

540
00:32:34,800 --> 00:32:37,000
Just be yourself.

541
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,700
Why are you blushing?

542
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:44,200
You are blushing.

543
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:46,200
From here to there.

544
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:48,100
What did I do?

545
00:32:50,200 --> 00:32:52,400
- It's quite cute.
- Stop!

546
00:32:52,400 --> 00:32:54,100
Pay attention.

547
00:32:55,800 --> 00:32:59,300
What I taught you was just a drop in the bucket.

548
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:01,400
I'll show you one big move.

549
00:33:21,400 --> 00:33:23,400
Too much.

550
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:29,900
Too dazzling.

551
00:33:34,500 --> 00:33:36,500
No. No. No.

552
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:43,100
<i>I'm here by the building. Waiting for you</i>

553
00:33:43,100 --> 00:33:45,400
Hurry up.

554
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,700
Okay. This one.

555
00:33:53,400 --> 00:33:55,400
Now, this is comfortable.

556
00:34:04,400 --> 00:34:07,700
- You...
- You... You first.

557
00:34:09,000 --> 00:34:11,000
What do you have in mind?

558
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,500
I'll take you to a place.

559
00:34:12,500 --> 00:34:13,900
Where?

560
00:34:13,900 --> 00:34:15,900
You'll see.

561
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:20,400
<i>Heartbeat Touch Law.</i>

562
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:24,400
<i>Use skin contacts properly.</i>

563
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:26,000
<i>Too much is too little.</i>

564
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:30,300
<i>Gu Jiaxin's idea might actually work on Xu Ningyuan.</i>

565
00:34:31,200 --> 00:34:33,000
<i>But touch where?</i>

566
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,600
<i>Where is the switch?</i>

567
00:34:34,600 --> 00:34:39,300
<i>Hands? Head? Or face?</i>

568
00:34:48,600 --> 00:34:50,100
What?

569
00:34:51,800 --> 00:34:53,400
Exercising my wrist.

570
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,500
<i>So stupid.</i>

571
00:35:09,100 --> 00:35:11,500
- Please.
- Thank you.

572
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,500
This is a nice place, right?

573
00:35:14,500 --> 00:35:17,600
Yeah. It's quiet here.

574
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:19,800
We don't eat together often.

575
00:35:19,800 --> 00:35:22,000
Quietness is good.

576
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:29,900
<i>Mr. Xu, hello. I'm Zhao Jiangyue.</i>

577
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:37,200
What?

578
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:40,500
Nothing.

579
00:35:40,500 --> 00:35:43,200
I just remembered the younger you.

580
00:35:45,100 --> 00:35:49,200
I was too young. I didn't know anything.

581
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,100
Maybe you were a little reckless, but you had that spirit.

582
00:35:53,100 --> 00:35:55,000
I'm a good judge of people.

583
00:35:55,000 --> 00:35:57,100
You are in charge now.

584
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:59,400
People grow up.

585
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:02,400
What drink?

586
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,000
Anything.

587
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:07,400
Take a look.

588
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:12,300
<i>Use skin contact.</i>

589
00:36:13,100 --> 00:36:16,900
<i>This move is especially effective with men.</i>

590
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,600
Hello, are you ready to order?

591
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:27,600
Excuse me.

592
00:36:29,800 --> 00:36:32,200
<i>Why was it so easy for Gu Jiaxin</i>

593
00:36:32,200 --> 00:36:33,800
<i>and so hard for me?</i>

594
00:36:33,800 --> 00:36:36,300
The menu is a bit too heavy.

595
00:36:36,300 --> 00:36:39,200
Should we eat something first?

596
00:36:39,200 --> 00:36:40,600
Okay.

597
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:45,800
<i>Is Gu Jiaxin's idea trustworthy?</i>

598
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:50,000
<i>Whatever. There's nothing awkward about it.</i>

599
00:36:57,300 --> 00:37:01,000
Do-Do I have something on my face?

600
00:37:02,000 --> 00:37:03,600
No.

601
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:05,200
I'm just exercising my arm.

602
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,400
There is always an indirect spasm.

603
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:12,600
Then you need to see a doctor.

604
00:37:12,600 --> 00:37:15,000
It's fine. Fine.

605
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,400
Do you need help with cutting it?

606
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:18,900
No, thanks. I can manage.

607
00:37:18,900 --> 00:37:21,000
- For real?
- Yeah.

608
00:37:21,800 --> 00:37:24,000
<i>Make skin contact deliberately.</i>

609
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:27,100
<i>I knew it would be too intentional.</i>

610
00:37:27,100 --> 00:37:30,600
We haven't seen each other for three years, right?

611
00:37:30,600 --> 00:37:32,300
Three years and a half.

612
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,700
So long?

613
00:37:34,500 --> 00:37:38,000
How have you been doing lately? Why did you come back suddenly?

614
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,200
Adjustments in work. And I also wanted to check on my parents.

615
00:37:42,200 --> 00:37:43,800
Good.

616
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:51,800
<i>Before he asks, stay mysterious.</i>

617
00:37:51,800 --> 00:37:53,600
<i>What if he is more patient than me?</i>

618
00:37:53,600 --> 00:37:57,000
<i>Then wait till he isn't.</i>

619
00:37:58,000 --> 00:38:02,300
I heard that you planned to find a boyfriend within three months.

620
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:04,800
Is that right? Any progress?

621
00:38:04,800 --> 00:38:08,900
<i>Once he can't help asking, start your topic.</i>

622
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:11,800
It's planned.

623
00:38:11,800 --> 00:38:14,400
So you have a target?

624
00:38:14,400 --> 00:38:15,800
<i>But remember one thing.</i>

625
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:18,300
Only casual topics. No relationships.

626
00:38:18,300 --> 00:38:20,000
<i>Make him wonder.</i>

627
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:22,200
Working on it.

628
00:38:22,200 --> 00:38:25,400
With Jingjing's help, there should be no problem.

629
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,800
You've always been serious.

630
00:38:35,800 --> 00:38:37,600
<i>How is it going?</i>

631
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
I...

632
00:38:42,600 --> 00:38:44,400
<i>Any progress?</i>

633
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:46,100
It's okay. You can do your thing.

634
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:48,400
It's fine. It's nothing.

635
00:38:53,200 --> 00:38:55,600
<i>If we can't find subjects, and it's awkward,</i>

636
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,600
<i>can I talk about work?</i>

637
00:38:58,400 --> 00:38:59,600
<i>Fine.</i>

638
00:38:59,600 --> 00:39:02,000
<i>At least you are talkative about work.</i>

639
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:06,200
Actually, Ms. Jin gave me the information about your company.

640
00:39:06,200 --> 00:39:08,300
She values this cooperation a lot.

641
00:39:08,300 --> 00:39:12,600
I didn't get the chance to introduce our new project to you.

642
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:14,900
I've heard that. It's popular among the young.

643
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:18,600
Yes. We created an online dating platform.

644
00:39:18,600 --> 00:39:21,000
It also includes offline matchmaking stores.

645
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:23,700
The live streaming last time, and hiring Jingjing as our poster

646
00:39:23,700 --> 00:39:26,200
were to propagate Love Note.

647
00:39:26,200 --> 00:39:29,600
Let's leave work in the office.

648
00:39:29,600 --> 00:39:32,200
This is a private date.

649
00:39:34,800 --> 00:39:37,700
Sorry. I couldn't help it.

650
00:39:37,700 --> 00:39:40,800
That's fine. I also do it sometimes.

651
00:39:42,200 --> 00:39:43,500
Try the food.

652
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:45,000
Okay.

653
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,900
<i>[Love Note]
[The result is not important,]</i>

654
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,040
[but the process of sounding each other out is.]

655
00:40:12,800 --> 00:40:14,800
Life is no film.

656
00:40:14,800 --> 00:40:17,000
Not every story has an ending.

657
00:40:17,000 --> 00:40:18,000
Some people say,

658
00:40:18,000 --> 00:40:20,400
"If I can already foresee the impossible end,

659
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:23,200
I'd rather not start."

660
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,500
I beg to differ.

661
00:40:25,500 --> 00:40:29,300
Not every relationship ends up in marriage.

662
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:32,800
Enjoying it is the most important.

663
00:40:37,400 --> 00:40:40,500
What's the best part of dating?

664
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:50,000
It's the process of sounding each other out.

665
00:40:53,600 --> 00:40:56,600
Sometimes, an inadvertent touch can

666
00:40:56,600 --> 00:41:00,200
say more than a loud "I love you,"

667
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:01,600
and move people more.

668
00:41:01,600 --> 00:41:03,100
We know this saying.

669
00:41:03,100 --> 00:41:06,500
You want to date her, and she wants to date you.

670
00:41:06,500 --> 00:41:09,400
You both know you would someday,

671
00:41:09,400 --> 00:41:12,600
but don't know which day it is.

672
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,700
That is the best time.

673
00:41:14,700 --> 00:41:16,600
Love is not a one-man show.

674
00:41:16,600 --> 00:41:18,000
I wish you all find

675
00:41:18,000 --> 00:41:21,400
that person who is willing to be your partner.
