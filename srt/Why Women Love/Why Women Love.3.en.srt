00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,739
Your work is being closely connected to your love life now.

163
00:09:55,739 --> 00:09:58,100
Are you going to give up your goal for love?

164
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:00,399
There's a lot about what you wear for dating,

165
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:02,639
definitely more than that for an interview.

166
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,539
There are 90% of dating cases

167
00:10:04,539 --> 00:10:07,640
that fail in the first three seconds.

168
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:08,899
Don't be too sexy

169
00:10:08,899 --> 00:10:13,110
and make others feel like you want to conquer all men.

170
00:10:14,050 --> 00:10:16,689
Don't overdress and leave the impression

171
00:10:16,689 --> 00:10:19,490
of not having a proper date for a long time.

172
00:10:19,490 --> 00:10:23,999
Being elegant and tasteful is the key to a successful date.

173
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:34,299
Slightly show your curve

174
00:10:34,299 --> 00:10:36,520
but don't be too revealing.

175
00:10:36,520 --> 00:10:38,469
It's subtle and feminine.

176
00:10:38,470 --> 00:10:41,540
Little Aunt, you should try this. It's so pretty.

177
00:10:41,540 --> 00:10:43,200
I can't fake it for even just three seconds.

178

Do you actually want to get a boyfriend and meet your KPI?

179
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:48,540
Of course. Then follow my words!

Little Aunt, listen to Jingjing.

Jing, do you have any relationship tips to share?
<i>[Elite Singles' Night]</i>

186
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,639
First of all, you have to be good to yourself.

187
00:11:23,639 --> 00:11:27,010
Two people getting along needs mutual respect.

With the dress, you are charming.

193

This is simply an outfit for work.

How do I look?

195
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:42,150
Very common.

196
00:12:45,250 --> 00:12:47,660
So I don't need to worry.

197
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:51,459
- Worry about what?
- No one is into you.

198
00:12:51,459 --> 00:12:53,780
Just worry about yourself.

199
00:12:55,390 --> 00:12:59,539
Every guest will have a rose for someone they like.

200
00:12:59,539 --> 00:13:02,250
- How many roses will you receive?
- More than what you receive.

201
00:13:02,250 --> 00:13:05,390
That's confidence. How about this?

If you win, I'm willing to do anything for you.

- I won't.

hosted by Link Technology and Golden Golf Club.

214

To keep the event efficient,

215
00:14:08,030 --> 00:14:10,250
we have two parts, eight-minute speed dating

216
00:14:10,250 --> 00:14:12,519
and dating with your crush.

217
00:14:12,520 --> 00:14:15,349
Each round of speed dating is eight minutes.

218
00:14:15,349 --> 00:14:18,650
On-site guests are free to match up by themselves.

219
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:20,839
ut when the time is up, you have to switch

220
00:14:20,840 --> 00:14:22,639
and have another round with someone else.

221
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,109
In speed dating, you can send your rose

222
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,339
to someone you like to express your feelings.

223
00:14:28,339 --> 00:14:31,320
After four rounds, guests who show mutual affection

224
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:35,010
can head to the Love Gate on the stage and have a more detailed dating plan

225
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:39,200
and matching analysis using Love Note.

226
00:14:39,200 --> 00:14:41,669
You will also receive a dating fund

227
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:43,879
provided by Golden Golf Club,

228
00:14:43,879 --> 00:14:47,929
and then you can dine in the dining hall, get to know each other better,

229
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:51,960
and continue your romantic night.

230

The bell of happiness is about to ring.

Please open your heart and trust yourself.

I don't have this word in my dictionary.

What do you like to do usually?

238
00:16:06,010 --> 00:16:07,260
Motorbike.

239
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:10,109
Motorbike? That's so cool!

240
00:16:10,110 --> 00:16:11,860
We should ride together!

241
00:16:11,860 --> 00:16:13,739
I have never had a girl on my back seat.

But don't drive too fast. I will be scared.

- Wait, hello.

Is it possible that I give you one hundred or two, and you give me your rose?

251
00:16:53,020 --> 00:16:55,634
The information here said you have a high EQ,

252

and that you are thoughtful and eloquent.

253

Why don't I see those qualities at all?

254

You can't see properly, I guess.

324
00:21:46,385 --> 00:21:49,375
Eight minutes. Who can get the other's rose wins.

325
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:53,124
If I just refuse to give you my rose, you will never win.

326
00:21:54,845 --> 00:21:56,505
That's true.

327
00:21:58,085 --> 00:22:00,185
So, I just want you to win.

328
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:04,815
This rose was especially saved for you.

329
00:22:24,115 --> 00:22:25,995
You were touched.

330
00:22:25,995 --> 00:22:27,995
You were.

331
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:35,120
<i>[Your event is very special.]</i>

332
00:22:43,785 --> 00:22:45,455
Your rose!

333
00:22:46,155 --> 00:22:48,345
Thank you, Ms. Jingjing.

334
00:22:49,245 --> 00:22:51,395
Excuse me.

335
00:22:51,395 --> 00:22:52,885
Thank you.

336
00:22:56,845 --> 00:22:58,515
May I sit here?

337
00:22:59,185 --> 00:23:01,485
What can I do for you?

338
00:23:02,395 --> 00:23:04,934
- Please take a seat.
- Great.

339
00:23:07,205 --> 00:23:11,015
I'm sorry. Let me introduce myself. I'm Vincent.

340
00:23:11,015 --> 00:23:13,675
I'm a divorce lawyer.

341
00:23:13,675 --> 00:23:15,334
<i>[Vincent. Law Firm]
So we are the opposite.</i>

342
00:23:15,335 --> 00:23:19,354
You teach people how to get together, and you help them break up.

343
00:23:19,354 --> 00:23:22,095
So we can balance things up together.

344
00:23:22,635 --> 00:23:26,595
Ms. Jingjing, do you have time after this?

345
00:23:26,595 --> 00:23:28,305
May I buy you a drink?

346
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:30,775
I have something else. Maybe next time.

347
00:23:30,775 --> 00:23:34,174
How about your WeChat? May I have it?

348
00:23:34,174 --> 00:23:36,495
This will do.

349
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:39,194
Sorry, I need to go.

350
00:23:39,805 --> 00:23:41,899
- See you.
- Bye.

351
00:24:11,965 --> 00:24:13,585
Jiangyue.

352
00:24:21,995 --> 00:24:24,825
- Sorry. I'm so sorry.
- It's okay.

353
00:24:24,865 --> 00:24:26,535
Are you okay?

354
00:24:26,535 --> 00:24:27,905
I'm fine.

355
00:24:27,905 --> 00:24:30,105
Mr. Xu, it's been a while.

356
00:24:30,105 --> 00:24:31,445
Yes, indeed.

357
00:24:31,445 --> 00:24:33,515
You are still clumsy.

358
00:24:34,395 --> 00:24:35,725
Why are you here?

359
00:24:35,725 --> 00:24:37,185
I'm back from abroad.

360
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,975
I heard.

361
00:24:38,975 --> 00:24:41,155
You still keep an eye on me.

362
00:24:43,965 --> 00:24:45,140
You joined it personally?

363
00:24:45,140 --> 00:24:47,965
- No, I...
- Excuse me.

364
00:24:47,965 --> 00:24:50,025
I haven't finished. Why did you leave?

365
00:24:50,025 --> 00:24:51,235
Let me introduce you.

366
00:24:51,235 --> 00:24:53,275
This is my assistant, Gu Jiaxin.

367
00:24:53,275 --> 00:24:55,155
This is Xu Ningyaun, Mr. Xu.

368
00:24:55,155 --> 00:24:57,184
- Hello.
- Hello, Mr. Xu.

369
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:04,294
- The Mr. Xu?
- Shut up.

370
00:25:05,155 --> 00:25:06,935
She mentioned me before?

371
00:25:07,445 --> 00:25:09,705
Yes, yes. I've heard a lot about you.

372
00:25:09,705 --> 00:25:13,754
You are indeed very charming. Just like what she said.

373
00:25:13,754 --> 00:25:16,965
You can simply be quiet.

374
00:25:16,965 --> 00:25:18,485
Maybe I can drive you home?

375
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:21,155
No, it's fine. I still have something to do.

376
00:25:21,155 --> 00:25:23,875
It's okay. I can do it for you.

377
00:25:23,875 --> 00:25:25,635
It's fine.

378
00:25:26,685 --> 00:25:29,165
Mr. Xu, let's have dinner together next time.

379
00:25:29,165 --> 00:25:31,594
Sure, my phone number hasn't changed. Call me.

380
00:25:31,594 --> 00:25:32,495
Okay.

381
00:25:32,495 --> 00:25:34,405
- Okay. See you around.
- See you.

382
00:25:34,405 --> 00:25:36,735
- Bye.
- Bye, Mr. Xu.

383
00:25:39,925 --> 00:25:41,605
Wait, you...

384
00:25:42,155 --> 00:25:44,395
- Should I give you a hand?
- No, thank you.

385
00:25:55,155 --> 00:25:58,664
May I drive you, prestigious guest?

386
00:25:58,665 --> 00:26:00,455
Forget it.

387
00:26:03,785 --> 00:26:05,245
Come on.

388
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:07,265
I know I said something wrong.

389
00:26:07,265 --> 00:26:10,465
I apologize. Sorry.

390
00:26:13,235 --> 00:26:14,775
Please get in, my boss.

391
00:26:14,775 --> 00:26:17,035
It's difficult to get a taxi here.

392
00:27:00,725 --> 00:27:05,284
So for our competition, the winner is you or me?

393
00:27:06,235 --> 00:27:08,555
Can you stop talking?

394
00:27:11,935 --> 00:27:15,454
So, Mr. Xu is the one you like?

395
00:27:15,995 --> 00:27:17,325
Why are you asking this?

396
00:27:17,325 --> 00:27:20,455
You are absolutely worthy of him on this condition.

397
00:27:20,455 --> 00:27:23,024
Why are you so insecure and avoiding him?

398
00:27:23,024 --> 00:27:25,095
- I didn't avoid him.
- You didn't?

399
00:27:25,095 --> 00:27:27,275
He said he would drive you home.

400
00:27:27,275 --> 00:27:29,315
Such a great opportunity.

401
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:30,985
And you rejected it.

402
00:27:30,985 --> 00:27:34,315
I was not at my best at that time. It's not convenient.

403
00:27:34,315 --> 00:27:36,734
The messier and more helpless you are,

404
00:27:36,735 --> 00:27:39,714
men will show you more protectiveness and love.

405
00:27:39,714 --> 00:27:44,494
I mean, it was such an excellent opportunity today, and you just threw it away.

406
00:27:48,005 --> 00:27:50,395
I really think you need a relationship mentor.

407
00:27:50,395 --> 00:27:53,924
Otherwise, your goal of falling in love in three months will not be realized.

408
00:27:53,924 --> 00:27:55,055
I recommend myself.

409
00:27:55,055 --> 00:27:56,775
I don't need it.

410
00:28:11,655 --> 00:28:16,515
I'm serious. Or it will be impossible for you to fall in love in three months.

411
00:28:25,515 --> 00:28:27,785
Let me teach you how to love.

412
00:28:29,725 --> 00:28:31,845
Think about it.

413
00:28:31,845 --> 00:28:33,904
Don't just date someone. It's pointless.

414
00:28:33,905 --> 00:28:39,135
The first step to falling in love is to give up your rationality.

415
00:28:39,135 --> 00:28:41,515
Feel it with your heart.

416
00:28:41,515 --> 00:28:43,505
How about this?

417
00:28:43,505 --> 00:28:47,295
I'm going to plan a perfect date for you.

418
00:28:55,435 --> 00:28:57,105
I'm telling you.

419
00:28:57,105 --> 00:28:59,205
Don't do any tricks.

420
00:28:59,205 --> 00:29:02,475
Work and life are two separate things.

421
00:29:02,475 --> 00:29:06,144
If you fail your job, I won't let you leave.

422
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:11,574
Don't. Can we talk about it nicely?

423
00:29:13,235 --> 00:29:16,025
I'm really not interested in business.

424
00:29:16,025 --> 00:29:17,425
How about this?

425
00:29:17,425 --> 00:29:19,895
You convince my mother to let me go,

426
00:29:19,895 --> 00:29:21,845
and I will help you fall in love.

427
00:29:21,845 --> 00:29:24,624
One less eyesore for you, and you get beautiful love.

428
00:29:24,624 --> 00:29:28,285
This is definitely a win for you.

429
00:29:28,285 --> 00:29:30,865
Why don't you want to inherit the company?

430
00:29:30,865 --> 00:29:34,914
You were born with this opportunity that many others are trying to get for their entire life.

431
00:29:34,914 --> 00:29:36,925
I don't like doing business.

432
00:29:36,925 --> 00:29:39,785
I just want to race.

433
00:29:39,785 --> 00:29:41,684
So it's all about having fun.

434
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:43,545
Racing is not for fun.

435
00:29:43,545 --> 00:29:44,955
It's my...

436
00:29:44,955 --> 00:29:47,025
It's my dream.

437
00:29:47,025 --> 00:29:50,484
And there's a special reason that I have to join the competition this year.

438
00:29:50,484 --> 00:29:52,875
I have to train as soon as possible.

439
00:29:53,865 --> 00:29:55,925
I got it.

440
00:29:55,925 --> 00:29:58,424
But it's your job to be an assistant.

441
00:29:58,425 --> 00:29:59,975
As for my relationship issue,

442
00:30:00,905 --> 00:30:03,424
when I was holding a boy's hand in kindergarten,

443
00:30:03,424 --> 00:30:05,235
you were still a baby.

444
00:30:05,235 --> 00:30:08,355
- Don't bother about it.
- All right.

445
00:30:12,325 --> 00:30:14,684
But you were touched just now, right?

446
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:17,700
You can pretend to be calm, but your heart rate speaks the truth.

447
00:30:17,794 --> 00:30:22,025
If you speak again, I will hit your head with my heel.

448
00:30:50,825 --> 00:30:54,554
So, Mr. Xu is the one you like?

449
00:30:57,935 --> 00:31:01,474
<i>Hello, Mr. Xu. I'm Zhao Jiangyue.</i>

<i>[High heels, expensive]</i>

What kind of high heels will suit such a female devil?

471

<i>Love is so hard.</i>

Come in.

00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:22,375
You look so good.

477

You didn't have breakfast, right?

478
00:35:24,665 --> 00:35:26,875
I brought breakfast for you.

479
00:35:28,395 --> 00:35:31,575
Did you tidy it up? And the flowers?

480
00:35:31,575 --> 00:35:33,234
I ordered them for half a year.

481
00:35:33,234 --> 00:35:35,975
I wish you to be as pretty as the flower every day.

482
00:35:35,975 --> 00:35:38,375
Were you kidnapped by aliens?

483
00:35:38,375 --> 00:35:40,185
Is anyone forcing you to do this?

484
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,765
You are hilarious.

This is my job.

486
00:35:44,705 --> 00:35:47,065
I've thought about it for the whole night...

for you to fall in love quickly.

490
00:35:54,855 --> 00:35:57,154
Who am I going to date according to your plan?

491
00:35:57,154 --> 00:35:58,815
It doesn't matter who you are going to date.

492
00:35:58,815 --> 00:36:03,604
It's more about how you can be more capable of love step by step.

493
00:36:03,604 --> 00:36:06,835
Have you finished your report of the Elite Singles' Night?

494
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:09,824
That's not important. The most important thing is your love life.

495
00:36:09,824 --> 00:36:12,254
It's office hours now. I'm talking about your work.

496
00:36:12,254 --> 00:36:14,235
I'm also talking about work.

497
00:36:14,235 --> 00:36:16,534
Ms. Zhao, you are confusing work with a private life now.

498
00:36:16,534 --> 00:36:19,034
- What do you mean?
- Let me ask you.

499
00:36:19,034 --> 00:36:23,834
Did you make a promise in public to fall in love in three months?

500
00:36:23,834 --> 00:36:25,335
So is it about work or private life?

501
00:36:25,335 --> 00:36:28,734
And I wonder if you can be honest and say

502
00:36:28,734 --> 00:36:32,394
you have no problem falling in love at all and can get a boyfriend easily.

503
00:36:34,345 --> 00:36:37,855
I received more flowers than you at the Elite Singles' Night.

504
00:36:37,855 --> 00:36:40,315
You can't break your promise, right?

505
00:36:41,585 --> 00:36:45,175
I'm very sincere about helping you.

506
00:36:45,175 --> 00:36:47,105
It's okay that you don't know how to love.

507
00:36:47,105 --> 00:36:48,945
I'm your assistant.

508
00:36:48,945 --> 00:36:51,325
This is my job.

509
00:36:52,505 --> 00:36:53,854
How are you going to help me?

510
00:36:53,854 --> 00:36:56,124
I'm going to help you complete your love KPI.

511
00:36:56,124 --> 00:36:59,264
After three months, you will be together with your loved one,

512
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:01,935
and I can get the trophy.

513
00:37:01,935 --> 00:37:03,745
Will Ms. Jin allow you to leave?

514
00:37:03,745 --> 00:37:05,634
We can help each other.

515
00:37:05,634 --> 00:37:08,735
And with love, this will be a much better world.

516
00:37:10,245 --> 00:37:12,765
- Go out first.
- So it's a yes!

517
00:37:12,765 --> 00:37:16,055
- Smart decision.
- Wait!

518
00:37:16,055 --> 00:37:18,835
You can't regret it instantly like that.

519
00:37:19,305 --> 00:37:22,284
Take this away. I'm allergic to lillies.

520
00:37:22,284 --> 00:37:25,844
Sure. As you say.

521
00:37:32,925 --> 00:37:36,025
What's this?

522
00:37:36,025 --> 00:37:38,215
<i>This is yours.</i>

523
00:37:38,215 --> 00:37:39,574

526
00:37:45,230 --> 00:37:46,775
All yours.

527
00:37:47,585 --> 00:37:49,434
You are in a good mood today. What's the good news?

528
00:37:49,434 --> 00:37:51,745
The weather is good. That's why I'm happy.

529
00:37:51,745 --> 00:37:53,464
- Where are you going?
- I'm getting coffee for everyone.

530
00:37:53,464 --> 00:37:54,905
I'm going with you.

531
00:37:54,905 --> 00:37:57,125
The coffee is on me.

532
00:38:01,955 --> 00:38:03,865
It's quite busy today.

533
00:38:03,865 --> 00:38:07,394
That's good. Your business is better than ours.

534
00:38:19,475 --> 00:38:20,735
Let me ask you something.

535
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:22,135
What?

536
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:25,735
When was the last time Zhao Jiangyue was in a relationship?

537
00:38:25,735 --> 00:38:27,644
What does she like to do besides work?

538
00:38:27,644 --> 00:38:30,085
Why are you asking?

539
00:38:31,145 --> 00:38:34,534
Are you and my Little Aunt...

540
00:38:34,534 --> 00:38:36,135
No!

541
00:38:36,135 --> 00:38:38,615
Stop guessing.

542
00:38:38,615 --> 00:38:42,104
But please, give me some inside information.

543
00:38:42,104 --> 00:38:44,105
I will buy you milk tea for half a year.

544
00:38:44,105 --> 00:38:45,445
Really?

545
00:38:45,445 --> 00:38:48,964
For the sake of milk tea, I can share a bit with you.

546
00:38:49,545 --> 00:38:52,744
She normally looks cool,

547
00:38:52,744 --> 00:38:54,954
but she is like a little girl deep down.

548
00:38:54,954 --> 00:38:58,404
She likes fluffy toys and she likes desserts.

549
00:38:58,404 --> 00:39:00,634
She looks cool,

550
00:39:00,634 --> 00:39:02,854
but she doesn't have any love experience.

551
00:39:02,854 --> 00:39:07,674
Because she had such good grades and scared away all the boys who were into her.

552
00:39:07,674 --> 00:39:10,055
So she has had no experience in love!

553
00:39:10,055 --> 00:39:13,474
But if you two are together,

554
00:39:13,474 --> 00:39:15,025
I'm definitely rooting for it!

555
00:39:15,025 --> 00:39:17,304
Because you two really look like a couple together!

556
00:39:17,304 --> 00:39:21,255
I told you. I'm not interested in this type of woman.

557
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:24,724
But even if you were interested, I guess you wouldn't make it work.

558
00:39:24,724 --> 00:39:25,825
Why?

559
00:39:25,825 --> 00:39:28,404
- Because...
- Wait, let me guess.

560
00:39:28,404 --> 00:39:30,074
Mr. Xu, right?

561
00:39:30,074 --> 00:39:33,214
Since you know, why are you asking?

562
00:39:33,214 --> 00:39:36,565
I think Mr. Xu likes Zhao Jiangyue a lot.

563
00:39:36,565 --> 00:39:38,374
Why aren't they together?

564
00:39:38,374 --> 00:39:41,704
They are successful people, and they just don't speak out their thoughts.

565
00:39:41,704 --> 00:39:46,084
They have to try to figure out what the other is thinking first in case of losing face.

566
00:39:46,084 --> 00:39:52,304
Also, Little Aunt still has some doubts about Mr. Xu.

567
00:39:54,085 --> 00:39:57,544
Mr. Xu used to have a girlfriend for many years.

568
00:39:57,544 --> 00:39:59,344
She passed away because of an illness,

569
00:39:59,344 --> 00:40:02,154
but she is still someone special to him.

570
00:40:02,154 --> 00:40:04,784
Little Aunt doesn't want to be a substitute,

571
00:40:04,784 --> 00:40:08,334
and she doesn't want a shadow to get in the way of her love.

572
00:40:08,334 --> 00:40:11,154
That's why they got stuck at where they are now.

573
00:40:11,154 --> 00:40:14,455
And then she decided to focus on her career.

574
00:40:14,455 --> 00:40:18,144
So in the end, she became such a female devil in the workplace.

575
00:40:18,144 --> 00:40:20,935
There is a lot behind it.

576
00:40:40,690 --> 00:40:45,030
<i>[Love Note]
[Theory of Love Pyramid]</i>

577
00:40:45,030 --> 00:40:48,194
Why do the excellent, independent, and wealthy ladies around

578
00:40:48,194 --> 00:40:50,825
end up not being able to get a boyfriend?

579
00:40:50,825 --> 00:40:52,995
Excellent, independent, and wealthy.

580
00:40:52,995 --> 00:40:55,515
Are you talking about me?

581
00:40:55,515 --> 00:40:58,345
Cross wealthy off, thank you.

582
00:40:58,345 --> 00:41:00,105
Don't reveal the truth like this!

583
00:41:00,105 --> 00:41:02,754
So, can you explain it? I feel strange as well

584
00:41:02,754 --> 00:41:06,854
why people who don't really stand out are all in a relationship,

585
00:41:06,854 --> 00:41:09,275
but I'm still single?

586
00:41:09,275 --> 00:41:13,574
Have you ever heard of the theory of the Love Pyramid?

587
00:41:14,915 --> 00:41:16,865
As Love Note explains,

588
00:41:16,865 --> 00:41:21,954
according to statistics, 240 million people in China remain single.
<i>[Love Pyramid Theory]</i>

589
00:41:21,965 --> 00:41:25,354
If you divide all the men and women into four groups: A, B, C, and D.

590
00:41:25,354 --> 00:41:27,934
Most commonly, men will be the ones taking the lead.

591
00:41:27,934 --> 00:41:31,325
So men in group A will go for women in group B.

592
00:41:31,325 --> 00:41:33,474
Men in group B will go for women in group C.

593
00:41:33,474 --> 00:41:36,745
As it goes, those left alone in the end will be

594
00:41:36,745 --> 00:41:39,604
women in group A and men in group D.

595
00:41:39,604 --> 00:41:42,774
This is the well-known theory of the Love Pyramid.

596
00:41:42,774 --> 00:41:46,754
Does it mean that the best women will have the most difficulties in falling in love?

597
00:41:46,754 --> 00:41:47,915
Of course not!

598
00:41:47,915 --> 00:41:50,104
Only those who understand you can appreciate how excellent you are.

599
00:41:50,104 --> 00:41:53,434
So you have to stay positive and meet more people actively,

600
00:41:53,434 --> 00:41:55,545
especially to know more excellent men around you.

601
00:41:55,545 --> 00:41:57,665
That's how you can get out of being single.

602
00:41:57,665 --> 00:42:02,584
I agree. Let's take the initiative in love!
