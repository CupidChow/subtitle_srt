00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:17,229
Because it contains the first text you sent me.
<i>[Duoxi]</i>

163
00:10:17,229 --> 00:10:19,870
I couldn't bring myself to delete it.

164
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:25,609
At that time, this phone could only store 50 messages.

165
00:10:25,609 --> 00:10:28,840
I handpicked them and kept them since.

166
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:31,100
Why didn't you tell me earlier?

167
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:32,920
This too.

168
00:10:35,850 --> 00:10:40,720
<i>[Duoxi, I like you.]</i>

169
00:10:41,810 --> 00:10:45,890
This was... my draft on the day I transferred school.

170
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,750
But I wasn't brave enough to send it.

171
00:10:48,750 --> 00:10:51,870
In that case, I have something for you, too.

172
00:10:51,870 --> 00:10:53,840
You too?

173
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:55,600
Wait for me.

174
00:11:03,050 --> 00:11:05,129
Do you remember that you asked everyone to write in your yearbook

175
00:11:05,129 --> 00:11:06,789
when you were about to transfer to another school?

176
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:09,630
I got two memo sheets from you. I said I messed one up.

177
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:11,040
I remember.

178
00:11:11,040 --> 00:11:13,450
Actually, I didn't mess it up.

179
00:11:13,450 --> 00:11:15,900
I wasn't brave enough to give it to you.

180

Hey, Beautiful. Why are you here drinking alone?

184
00:12:01,350 --> 00:12:04,620
- I'll have a few rounds with you.
- No need.

185
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,300
Why drown your sorrows? Let it all out.

186
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:10,250
I'll lend you a listening ear.

187
00:12:10,250 --> 00:12:12,570
Stay away from me!

188
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:15,720
Mister, how are you related to this lady?

189
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:18,600
I'm talking to my girlfriend.

190
00:12:20,830 --> 00:12:23,720
- What's that?
- A high definition CCTV.

191
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:25,220
So you know it.

192
00:12:25,220 --> 00:12:28,160
Listen. If this lady doesn't know you,

193
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,790
what you did just now was sexual harassment.

194
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:34,930
Right. I forgot to introduce myself.

195

00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:44,890
Excuse me, I have something on. I'll leave.

198

Jingjing.

202
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:59,040
To run into each other on such a day.

203
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:00,950
I guess we have to call it fate.

204
00:13:00,950 --> 00:13:02,990
Yes.

205

Cheers.

208

- Then... where's your husband?
- Don't bring him up!

209
00:13:23,430 --> 00:13:25,280
I'm telling you.

210

We're already divorced.

I've got nothing to do with him now.

212

Aren't you drinking a little too much?

213

Since you're so heartless, Zhang Hao,

How's your arm? Does it still hurt?

227

It has been better these few days. The cast will be removed in two days.

228
00:15:10,670 --> 00:15:14,250
It's one thing to remove the cast, but an injury like this takes months to fully recover.

229
00:15:14,250 --> 00:15:16,160
You still need to take care.

230

Put your work aside and get some proper rest.

Not tonight.

Good, stay for dinner then.

- I'm fine with both.

Why? Don't you have faith in my culinary skills?

Didn't you say it was tasty these past few days?

- I can make dinner, too.

- Sure! I think it's great.

Why don't we eat out?

255
00:16:52,394 --> 00:16:55,984
Why eat out? Have you tasted Mr. Xu's cooking? Tie it.

256
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,935
- Is it okay?
- No problem.

257
00:17:01,935 --> 00:17:04,505
Mr. Xu, I'll leave the kitchen in your hands.

You don't say. Jiaxin is really a gourmet.

00:21:52,075 --> 00:21:55,875
No, no. Actually, you looked quite cute

321
00:21:55,875 --> 00:21:58,195
when you were drunk.

322
00:22:01,370 --> 00:22:05,404
Last night, I told you I was divorced.

323
00:22:05,405 --> 00:22:09,765
Actually, about this matter, we have not announced it yet.

324
00:22:09,765 --> 00:22:11,665
You know about my career.

325
00:22:11,665 --> 00:22:14,855
I do... However, there is no need to worry.

326
00:22:14,855 --> 00:22:17,360
Remember, I'm a divorce lawyer.

327
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:19,750
It is my job to maintain confidentiality.

328
00:22:19,750 --> 00:22:21,520
My lips are sealed.

329
00:22:21,525 --> 00:22:27,654
Also, who would believe the words of someone that drunk? Don't you think?

330
00:22:27,654 --> 00:22:30,955
If you put it that way, I don't know how I can thank you.

331
00:22:30,955 --> 00:22:32,924
How about a meal? Are you free this evening?

332
00:22:32,924 --> 00:22:35,855
I have something on tonight.

333
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:38,735
How about another day?

334
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:41,055
Sure!

335
00:22:52,070 --> 00:22:53,540
<i>[12th Floor]</i>

336
00:22:58,205 --> 00:23:00,054
Ms. Zhao, your hand is injured.

337
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:02,075
I'll walk Mr. Xu out for you.

338
00:23:02,075 --> 00:23:05,274
It's okay, go back. I'll see him out.

339
00:23:05,274 --> 00:23:09,045
Great timing. I have something to tell you in private.

340
00:23:34,715 --> 00:23:38,660
If I didn't go on that business trip and took you to dinner,
<i>[Unit 2, Block 10]</i>

341
00:23:38,660 --> 00:23:40,695
you might not have gotten hurt.

342
00:23:40,695 --> 00:23:42,385
It's nothing.

343
00:23:42,385 --> 00:23:44,995
Love Note was launched on Valentine's Day.

344
00:23:44,995 --> 00:23:47,335
I was really busy that day, too.

345
00:23:48,785 --> 00:23:50,434
- I'll take a call.
- Sure.

346
00:23:50,434 --> 00:23:52,020
<i>[Gu Jiaxin]</i>

347
00:23:53,955 --> 00:23:57,405
- Hello?
- Ms. Zhao, you've run out of dishwashing liquid!

348
00:23:57,405 --> 00:23:59,264
Do you have a spare?
<i>[White Cat Dish Soap]</i>

349
00:23:59,264 --> 00:24:01,715
Wait for me, I'll go up and look for it.

350
00:24:09,975 --> 00:24:11,764
I'm really sorry for today.

351
00:24:11,765 --> 00:24:13,484
I should be the one treating you to dinner.

352
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,385
In the end, I made you cook.

353
00:24:15,385 --> 00:24:19,064
It's all right. I'm happy to cook for you.

354
00:24:21,095 --> 00:24:22,595
Wait.

355
00:24:25,095 --> 00:24:28,225
- Hello?
<i> - Ms. Zhao, do you have a band-aid?</i>

356
00:24:28,225 --> 00:24:31,265
- I pricked my hand, I...
- Bear with it.

357
00:24:32,290 --> 00:24:33,750
Hello?

358
00:24:38,405 --> 00:24:41,264
You're much closer with Gu Jianxin than I expected.

359
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:44,365
He comes over to cook for you even after working hours.

360
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,785
Not at all, we just happen to be neighbors.

361
00:24:47,785 --> 00:24:49,305
Is he okay?

362
00:24:49,305 --> 00:24:51,175
He's totally fine.

363
00:24:51,175 --> 00:24:53,684
- I'll get going then.
- Bye-bye.

364
00:25:07,265 --> 00:25:09,545
What took you so long? Come on in.

365
00:25:10,695 --> 00:25:12,735
Where did you hurt your hand?

366
00:25:21,405 --> 00:25:24,904
If you had come back sooner, you could still see the cut. See?

367
00:25:24,904 --> 00:25:27,215
It healed.

368
00:25:27,215 --> 00:25:28,675
Trying to be mischievous, huh?

369
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:30,694
I didn't, I swear!

370
00:25:30,695 --> 00:25:32,815
I really was pricked. I was bleeding.

371
00:25:32,815 --> 00:25:34,695
What pricked you?

372
00:25:40,765 --> 00:25:42,145
That.

373
00:25:52,235 --> 00:25:53,555
Look.

374
00:25:56,405 --> 00:25:57,814
It's flowering?

375
00:25:57,815 --> 00:25:59,625
I was surprised, too!

376
00:25:59,625 --> 00:26:02,855
I accidentally got pricked when looking at it.

377
00:26:06,595 --> 00:26:08,725
I heard that a cactus' flowering is like the iron tree's blooming,

378
00:26:08,800 --> 00:26:11,200
it only happens once in a blue moon.

379
00:26:12,445 --> 00:26:15,975
Could it be a prophecy?

380
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:17,605
What?

381
00:26:18,425 --> 00:26:23,555
It signifies that your love is about to blossom.

382
00:26:39,405 --> 00:26:42,905
There is nothing special about cacti that bloom often.

383
00:26:42,905 --> 00:26:46,425
Then, since it blossomed, I'll put it in your office.

384
00:26:46,425 --> 00:26:48,475
No.

385
00:26:48,475 --> 00:26:49,525
All right.

386
00:26:49,525 --> 00:26:51,995
Anything you say.

387
00:26:54,525 --> 00:26:56,155
It's beautiful.

402
00:28:13,455 --> 00:28:14,955
I knew it.

403
00:28:43,605 --> 00:28:47,245
- Miss you lots, Heng.
- Thanks.

404
00:28:47,265 --> 00:28:50,344
Congratulations! It's really not easy, really.

405
00:28:50,344 --> 00:28:51,384
Stop teasing me!

406
00:28:51,384 --> 00:28:54,275
What's the occasion? Did something good happen?

407
00:28:54,275 --> 00:28:55,875
I'm a witness!

408
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:58,205
Duoxi, come clean.

409
00:29:08,875 --> 00:29:11,015
You did it?

410
00:29:11,015 --> 00:29:12,945
Awesome!

411
00:29:12,945 --> 00:29:15,085
That silent Qi Heng finally got enlightened?

412
00:29:16,245 --> 00:29:18,124
You need to thank me, your matchmaker!

413
00:29:18,125 --> 00:29:19,214
Of course!

414
00:29:19,215 --> 00:29:21,174
Qi Heng told me. Thank God you helped.

415
00:29:21,174 --> 00:29:23,475
Otherwise, he intended to continue waiting.

416
00:29:23,475 --> 00:29:26,984
Silly. You're not that much better!

417
00:29:28,095 --> 00:29:29,885
This means we suit each other!

418
00:29:29,885 --> 00:29:33,145
Yeah. All right, let's stop here. Treat me to a meal.

419
00:29:33,145 --> 00:29:36,014
No problem. But I have to treat the girls first.

420
00:29:36,014 --> 00:29:38,695
You need to queue. Next week.

421
00:29:42,715 --> 00:29:46,435
I... I'll put aside my pride.

422
00:29:46,435 --> 00:29:48,035
You don't need to treat me separately.

423
00:29:48,035 --> 00:29:49,675
I'll go with you guys.

424
00:29:49,675 --> 00:29:51,545
We have a gender requirement, sir.

425
00:29:51,545 --> 00:29:53,165
You don't meet it.

426
00:29:53,165 --> 00:29:56,185
That's an unreasonable requirement.

427
00:29:56,185 --> 00:29:59,495
Gu Jiaxin, why do you keep trying to mingle with the girls?

428
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:02,085
Are you interested in one of the girls?

429
00:30:02,085 --> 00:30:03,895
Impossible.

430
00:30:03,895 --> 00:30:05,854
Little guy, here's a piece of advice.

431
00:30:05,855 --> 00:30:07,574
Don't keep your thoughts to yourself.

432
00:30:07,575 --> 00:30:10,844
As someone who walked that road before, you cannot hide love.

433
00:30:10,844 --> 00:30:12,255
Blockhead.

434
00:30:17,975 --> 00:30:22,605
<i>Was my love that obvious already?</i>

435
00:30:23,705 --> 00:30:26,174
What are you thinking?

436
00:30:26,175 --> 00:30:28,735
Did I hit the bull's eye? Admit it!

437
00:30:29,785 --> 00:30:32,235
Train more before guessing someone else's thoughts.

438
00:30:32,235 --> 00:30:33,505
I'm done talking with you.

439
00:30:33,505 --> 00:30:35,735
I have to prepare the meeting minutes.

440
00:30:37,045 --> 00:30:39,305
Are you still trying to deny it?

441
00:30:39,305 --> 00:30:41,145
Do we even have a meeting later?

442
00:30:43,525 --> 00:30:45,524
Dinner time!

443
00:30:45,525 --> 00:30:48,725
- Dinner time.
- Dinner time!

444
00:30:48,725 --> 00:30:49,694
I'm so hungry.

445
00:30:49,695 --> 00:30:52,404
I said I'll treat you all to dinner. Why are we having hotpot at home again?

446
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:55,664
With that pay of yours, we'd clean out your savings!

447
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:58,445
It's been so long since we last had hotpot together.

448
00:30:58,445 --> 00:30:59,454
Right, Duoxi.

449
00:30:59,455 --> 00:31:01,974
Now that you've got a boyfriend, you should tell us all about it!

450
00:31:01,975 --> 00:31:04,524
What exactly happened on Valentine's Day?

451
00:31:04,525 --> 00:31:05,764
On Valentine's Day,

452
00:31:05,765 --> 00:31:08,124
I was supposed to attend my idol's handshake event!

453
00:31:08,125 --> 00:31:12,635
But Qi Heng appeared suddenly and confessed to me.

454
00:31:16,235 --> 00:31:18,764
It was like an idol drama!

455
00:31:18,765 --> 00:31:21,004
That IT guy's quite romantic, huh?

456
00:31:21,005 --> 00:31:22,575
Qi Heng just looks stoic.

457
00:31:22,575 --> 00:31:26,484
But in fact, he's like a cute bubble inside.

458
00:31:26,485 --> 00:31:28,124
Sweet and gentle.

459
00:31:28,125 --> 00:31:30,985
You're giving soul to that fizzy drink!

460
00:31:30,985 --> 00:31:33,124
Duoxi, you're 100% smitten.

461
00:31:33,125 --> 00:31:34,244
You're a gone case!

462
00:31:34,245 --> 00:31:39,094
No matter what, let's all congratulate Duoxi for being off the market!

463
00:31:39,094 --> 00:31:40,054
Here, come on!

464
00:31:40,055 --> 00:31:42,475
- Cheers!
- Cheers!

465
00:31:44,475 --> 00:31:47,005
Let's eat. Dig in.

466
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:49,764
Look! Hotpot is like romance.

467
00:31:49,765 --> 00:31:51,505
The soup base is important.

468
00:31:51,505 --> 00:31:53,915
The more effort you put in, the better the taste.

469
00:31:53,915 --> 00:31:58,494
Duo Xi and Qi Heng's relationship is like an old soup simmered for a long, long time.

470
00:31:58,494 --> 00:32:00,694
Although the wait is long, the taste of love

471
00:32:00,695 --> 00:32:02,524
will definitely convince you to give it more time.

472
00:32:02,525 --> 00:32:03,574
You won't regret it either.

473
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:05,694
However, from my personal experience,

474
00:32:05,695 --> 00:32:07,385
you can't wait for too long either.

475
00:32:07,385 --> 00:32:10,384
Love is like instant-boiled mutton. A few swishes will be enough.

476
00:32:10,384 --> 00:32:13,004
You must eat it

477
00:32:13,005 --> 00:32:14,805
when it's most tender and delectable.

478
00:32:14,805 --> 00:32:17,854
If Gu Jiaxin didn't give us a push back then,

479
00:32:17,855 --> 00:32:19,785
we might have just missed each other.

480
00:32:19,785 --> 00:32:22,685
I feel that what's yours will be yours.

481
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,404
You wouldn't miss true love.

482
00:32:24,405 --> 00:32:26,974
Qi Heng and I waited for 10 years, but we're a rare case.

483
00:32:26,975 --> 00:32:29,484
You should always act when the time is ripe.

484
00:32:29,485 --> 00:32:30,854
Duoxi is right.

485
00:32:30,855 --> 00:32:33,404
Sometimes, even when you wait,

486
00:32:33,405 --> 00:32:35,375
you might not get the love you want.

487
00:32:35,375 --> 00:32:37,905
How's it going with Xu Ningyuan?

488
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:41,750
He visited me once after my hand got injured.

489
00:32:41,750 --> 00:32:42,884
After that, not much.

490
00:32:42,885 --> 00:32:45,124
You must be kidding. Valentine's Day is over.

491
00:32:45,125 --> 00:32:47,145
I thought he confessed!

492
00:32:47,145 --> 00:32:49,985
We've always been like that.

493
00:32:49,985 --> 00:32:54,225
Even till now, I still don't know if he really likes me.

494
00:32:54,225 --> 00:32:55,805
Listen.

495
00:32:55,805 --> 00:32:59,354
When you like someone, it'll be really obvious.

496
00:32:59,355 --> 00:33:02,074
If you can't sense his love toward you,

497
00:33:02,075 --> 00:33:04,975
it might mean that he's not that into you.

498
00:33:04,975 --> 00:33:08,815
How can I find out if he's truly interested in me then?

499
00:33:08,815 --> 00:33:11,714
Actually, there is no standard way of how people show their love.

500
00:33:11,715 --> 00:33:15,305
They say that a man doesn't like you if he doesn't buy you lipstick.

501
00:33:15,305 --> 00:33:18,224
Or if a man shells your prawn for you, it means that he adores you.

502
00:33:18,224 --> 00:33:21,474
Those are just slogans propagated by irresponsible media to deceive young girls.

503
00:33:21,474 --> 00:33:24,004
If you want to tell if a man truly likes you,

504
00:33:24,005 --> 00:33:25,585
you need to observe the following.

505
00:33:25,585 --> 00:33:30,555
Firstly, you realize that the frequency of him appearing in your life has increased.

506
00:33:30,555 --> 00:33:33,835
He would try all sorts of ways to appear in front of you,

507
00:33:33,835 --> 00:33:36,314
and instantly reply to your texts.

508
00:33:36,315 --> 00:33:39,695
He would want to share his life and social circle with you.

509
00:33:39,695 --> 00:33:43,025
<i>I passed by a display today and saw a teddy bear.</i>

510
00:33:43,025 --> 00:33:45,235
<i>It looks a little like you.</i>

511
00:33:46,135 --> 00:33:50,235
Secondly, you realize he's become very naggy.

512
00:33:50,235 --> 00:33:51,515
He knows what you like

513
00:33:51,515 --> 00:33:54,195
and wants to take care of the little details of your life.

514
00:33:54,195 --> 00:33:56,374
Even if he knows that you lack nothing,

515
00:33:56,374 --> 00:33:58,204
he still wants to dote on you.

516
00:33:58,204 --> 00:34:00,865
Without a bottom line.

517
00:34:08,025 --> 00:34:12,074
Thirdly, you find that he's become dumb and childish.

518
00:34:12,074 --> 00:34:14,244
Someone who's confident and talkative

519
00:34:14,245 --> 00:34:18,394
in front of others suddenly blushes in front of you.

520
00:34:18,394 --> 00:34:21,265
He cares a lot about how you see him.

521
00:34:28,245 --> 00:34:32,825
Lastly, he would be jealous when you interact with other guys.

522
00:34:32,825 --> 00:34:37,374
Especially when he knows that guy is interested in you, too.

523
00:34:45,305 --> 00:34:46,905
You're making my head spin.

524
00:34:46,905 --> 00:34:49,614
I was suspecting if Qi Heng really liked me back then.

525
00:34:49,614 --> 00:34:53,334
After hearing your words, I realized Qi Heng has hit every single point.

526
00:34:53,334 --> 00:34:54,724
Showing off now?

527
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,515
She's been single all this time.

528
00:34:56,515 --> 00:34:58,515
Let her show off.

529
00:34:58,515 --> 00:34:59,895
How do they put it again?

530
00:34:59,895 --> 00:35:02,505
There are three things that people cannot hide.

531
00:35:02,505 --> 00:35:06,505
Poverty, cough, and love.

532
00:35:07,395 --> 00:35:08,815
How about you?

533
00:35:08,815 --> 00:35:11,325
Didn't you go on a date yesterday?

534
00:35:11,325 --> 00:35:12,615
Of course.

535
00:35:12,615 --> 00:35:14,794
When have I, Qian Jingjing, ever run into trouble?

536
00:35:14,795 --> 00:35:15,684
True.

537
00:35:15,685 --> 00:35:18,274
Congratulations on finding a new love then!

538
00:35:18,275 --> 00:35:20,415
- Cheers!
- Congratulations!

539
00:35:25,075 --> 00:35:27,725
Dig in, dig in.

540
00:35:29,405 --> 00:35:31,585
Put some more ingredients in.

541
00:35:36,885 --> 00:35:41,015
- Zihao, Ms. Zhao has signed the document.
- I've put it on your desk.

542
00:35:41,015 --> 00:35:42,084
Okay. Thanks, Jiaxin.

543
00:35:42,084 --> 00:35:45,155
Sister Fen, is the financial statement ready?

544
00:35:45,155 --> 00:35:46,585
If it's all right, I'll deliver it to Ms. Zhao.

545
00:35:46,585 --> 00:35:48,944
- Sure! Thank you, Jiaxin.
- No problem.

546
00:35:48,944 --> 00:35:50,455
Jia...

547
00:35:52,895 --> 00:35:55,154
Don't you think Jiaxin has been really motivated recently?

548
00:35:55,154 --> 00:35:58,174
He keeps running to Ms. Zhao's office.

549
00:35:58,174 --> 00:36:00,260
That's right. I remember when Jiaxin first came,

550
00:36:00,260 --> 00:36:03,690
- he's always at loggerheads with Ms. Zhao.
- Yeah.

551
00:36:03,695 --> 00:36:05,745
Yet he's totally on her side now.

552
00:36:05,745 --> 00:36:08,275
As expected of the boss.

553
00:36:09,305 --> 00:36:11,505
Working hard is a good thing.

554
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:14,924
Jiaxin has always been a motivated hard worker.

555
00:36:14,925 --> 00:36:17,545
You guys just don't know him well.

556
00:36:18,585 --> 00:36:21,024
Anyhow, I just feel like

557
00:36:21,024 --> 00:36:23,705
there is an indescribable atmosphere in the air.

558
00:36:23,705 --> 00:36:25,185
What atmosphere?

559
00:36:25,185 --> 00:36:26,995
Take a sniff.

560
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,155
Smells nice.

561
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:32,014
Smells nice. The scent of roses.

562
00:36:32,014 --> 00:36:34,085
The scent of love.

563
00:36:34,085 --> 00:36:35,495
It can't be.

564
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:37,684
Their ages are quite far apart!

565
00:36:37,684 --> 00:36:42,624
- Also, with Ms. Zhao's character, she wouldn't like someone like Jiaxin.
- Exactly.

566
00:36:42,624 --> 00:36:45,455
Sister Fen, as the saying goes,

567
00:36:45,455 --> 00:36:48,554
"age is not a problem, nor is a height difference."

568
00:36:48,554 --> 00:36:51,115
The spark of love is everywhere.

569
00:36:51,115 --> 00:36:53,205
Shut up, won't you?

570
00:36:53,205 --> 00:36:55,155
Why are you mad?

571
00:36:55,155 --> 00:36:57,314
Jiaxin doesn't suit Ms. Zhao at all.

572
00:36:57,314 --> 00:36:59,595
They don't suit each other, they don't!

573
00:36:59,595 --> 00:37:01,654
- Okay, they are not a good match.
- They are not a good match.

574
00:37:01,654 --> 00:37:03,455
Yeah, they don't suit each other.

575
00:37:03,455 --> 00:37:05,135
Not a good match.

576
00:37:06,555 --> 00:37:08,355
Jiaxin!

577
00:37:08,355 --> 00:37:10,935
He's too nosy!

578
00:37:17,075 --> 00:37:20,314
Jiaxin! Are you tired from work lately?

579
00:37:20,314 --> 00:37:21,725
It's gone numb.

580
00:37:21,725 --> 00:37:24,604
Then let's go to a spa. To relax.

581
00:37:24,604 --> 00:37:26,895
No, go with your girlfriends.

582
00:37:26,895 --> 00:37:28,925
Have dinner with me then!

583
00:37:28,925 --> 00:37:30,385
I have to work all night.

584
00:37:30,385 --> 00:37:32,695
I don't want to hear a refusal.

585
00:37:32,695 --> 00:37:34,554
Otherwise, I'll get mad.

586
00:37:34,555 --> 00:37:37,094
If I get mad, I might... tell your secret to someone else.

587
00:37:37,094 --> 00:37:38,385
You!

588
00:37:38,385 --> 00:37:41,314
Okay? Please? You keep standing me up.

589
00:37:41,314 --> 00:37:42,694
Okay?

590
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:44,725
Okay, okay. Just dinner!

591
00:37:44,725 --> 00:37:46,035
Okay!

592
00:37:46,785 --> 00:37:48,885
We can't eat if you don't let go!

593
00:38:12,310 --> 00:38:13,500

00:38:42,825 --> 00:38:46,065

599
00:39:21,685 --> 00:39:25,415
Ms. Zhao, what's wrong?

600
00:39:25,415 --> 00:39:28,010
I couldn't find my keys.

601
00:39:28,010 --> 00:39:30,284
You're soaked. You'll catch a cold.

602
00:39:30,284 --> 00:39:32,875
Why not sort this out at my place first?

603
00:40:00,385 --> 00:40:03,795
I called three locksmiths and none picked up.

604
00:40:08,525 --> 00:40:10,345
Thank you.

605
00:40:16,735 --> 00:40:19,395
Didn't you go on a date with Li Yanran?

606
00:40:19,395 --> 00:40:22,965
No, I found an excuse and escaped.

607
00:40:27,305 --> 00:40:30,795
How did you know that she asked me out for dinner?

608
00:40:31,865 --> 00:40:34,894
You two were locking arms in front of my office.

609
00:40:34,895 --> 00:40:37,375
I couldn't help but overhear.

610
00:40:39,076 --> 00:40:40,736
Are you jealous?

611
00:40:40,736 --> 00:40:42,595
That's not it.

612
00:40:44,285 --> 00:40:48,005
What should we do? We can't reach a locksmith.

613
00:40:48,005 --> 00:40:50,415
Why don't you stay the night here?

614
00:40:52,732 --> 00:40:55,002
You'll sleep on the bed, I can take the sofa.

615
00:40:56,585 --> 00:40:58,175
Forget it, I should take the sofa.

616
00:40:58,175 --> 00:41:00,555
Who would let a lady sleep on a sofa?

617
00:41:00,555 --> 00:41:02,645
I've changed the sheets.

618
00:41:05,785 --> 00:41:07,705
All right, then.

619
00:41:07,705 --> 00:41:09,805
You sprained your ankle, right?

00:41:09,805 --> 00:41:10,745
I'll help you treat it.

- I can do it myself.
- It's okay, sit.

<i>[When a man loves you]</i>

624
00:41:59,025 --> 00:42:01,784
It's actually quite easy to tell

625
00:42:01,784 --> 00:42:03,935
if a man likes you.

626
00:42:08,845 --> 00:42:11,745
True love is when someone who never cooks

627
00:42:11,745 --> 00:42:14,079
is willing to make you a hot meal.

628

<i>[Qi Xiaohu, I want to tell you that I like you.]</i>

630
00:42:20,365 --> 00:42:21,945
It's when someone who's too shy to mention love

631
00:42:21,945 --> 00:42:25,225
musters the courage to confess.

632
00:42:33,125 --> 00:42:38,084
It's when someone tries to listen and understand your everything.

633
00:42:38,084 --> 00:42:41,445
This must be a person who genuinely likes you.

634
00:42:41,445 --> 00:42:45,434
Those who really love you will find all sorts of reasons to stay by your side.
