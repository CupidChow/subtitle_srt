00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:20,280
<i>Ms. Zhao! Save her!</i>

162
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,699
<i>Ms. Zhao fell into the water.</i>

163
00:15:21,700 --> 00:15:24,340
- Jiaxin.
<i>- Ms. Zhao!</i>

164
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:27,000
<i>Somebody, help her!</i>

165
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:28,800
<i>Ms. Zhao!</i>

166
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:31,280
<i>Ms. Zhao! Ms. Zhao!</i>

167
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:52,419
- Ms. Zhao, are you okay?
<i>- Ms. Zhao!</i>

168
00:15:52,419 --> 00:15:54,439
<i>- Ms. Zhao.
- Are you all right?</i>

169
00:15:54,439 --> 00:15:55,579
<i>- Shall we call 120?</i>
- It's okay, I'm fine.

170
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,440
- Are you feeling okay?
- That's dangerous.

171
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,320
You're right.

172
00:15:58,320 --> 00:15:59,879
Your clothing's all wet.

173
00:15:59,879 --> 00:16:01,980
Right, don't catch a cold.

174
00:16:01,980 --> 00:16:03,080
It's better to consult a doctor.

175
00:16:03,080 --> 00:16:04,940
No, I'm fine.

176
00:16:05,860 --> 00:16:07,620
Thanks.

177
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,179
- Are you sure you're okay, Ms. Zhao?
- Shall we go to the hospital?

178
00:16:10,179 --> 00:16:12,580
I'm fine. Don't worry.

179
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:23,679
Have some hot tea. Don't catch a cold.

180
00:16:23,679 --> 00:16:25,240
Thank you.

181
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:37,279
- Ms. Zhao.
- Jiangyue.

182
00:16:38,060 --> 00:16:39,960
You fell into the lake?

183
00:16:39,960 --> 00:16:41,520
Yes.

184
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:44,900
Are you feeling okay?

185
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:47,980
I'm fine. The water wasn't deep.

186
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:52,659
Jiaxin, they are setting up a barbecue grill.

187
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:54,059
Shall we give them a hand?

188
00:16:54,059 --> 00:16:56,220
Let's wait for Ms. Zhao.

189
00:16:56,220 --> 00:16:59,779
It's all right. You guys go ahead. I'm fine.

190
00:17:00,820 --> 00:17:02,360
Okay.

191
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,660
Fighting.

192
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,839
Are you going back today?

193
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,620
Nope. Can I stay for dinner?

194
00:17:12,620 --> 00:17:15,380
Sure. Let's go.

195
00:17:17,100 --> 00:17:18,660
Come.

196
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,560
<i>You're playing well.</i>

197
00:17:21,560 --> 00:17:23,960
Give it a good fan.

198
00:17:25,560 --> 00:17:27,640
<i>What card are you holding?</i>

199
00:17:27,640 --> 00:17:30,000
<i>Let's go for another round.</i>

200
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:32,660
Start skewering.

201
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:56,580
Mr. Xu. You didn't expect this, right?

202
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:58,100
I've also prepared an outfit for you.

203
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,799
What kind of team building is this?

204
00:17:59,799 --> 00:18:01,479
Why do we have to dress up like this?

205
00:18:01,479 --> 00:18:03,060
You don't understand this, right?

206
00:18:03,060 --> 00:18:05,359
The Republic of China cosplay.

207
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:07,520
By wearing costumes of the Republic of China era,

208
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,800
everyone can feel the charm of this ancient town.

209
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:16,039
Don't you think your attire matches well with Ms. Zhao's?

210
00:18:16,039 --> 00:18:18,160
I don't think so.

211
00:18:19,200 --> 00:18:22,559
Don't you think they are getting a little too close?

212
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,000
Is this normal?

213
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:27,799
It's all right, just normal communication between staff.

214
00:18:27,799 --> 00:18:30,620
- But we can't do nothing.
<i>- Let's prepare another skewer.</i>

215
00:18:30,620 --> 00:18:34,559
If you don't do anything, the two of them will only get closer.

216
00:18:35,320 --> 00:18:37,439
So for tonight's ancient town treasure hunt,

217
00:18:37,439 --> 00:18:39,920
I'm going to stick close to Jiaxin.

218
00:18:39,920 --> 00:18:42,440
You also have to stay with Ms. Zhao all the time.

219
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:44,600
You get what I mean?

220
00:18:44,600 --> 00:18:47,540
Treasure hunt. Did you plan it?

221
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,959
Two in a group, each group will act separately.

222
00:18:49,959 --> 00:18:55,739
This way, you can have a romantic night alone with Ms. Zhao.

223
00:18:55,739 --> 00:18:57,999
Do you want to confess to Ms. Zhao tonight?

224
00:18:57,999 --> 00:18:59,719
According to Love Note,

225
00:18:59,719 --> 00:19:01,539
if you make a love confession

226
00:19:01,540 --> 00:19:03,359
to someone you like in a special place,

227
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,880
you have a higher chance of success.

228
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,760
After all, in this unfamiliar place,

229
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,460
you are the only thing that is familiar to her.

230
00:19:11,460 --> 00:19:13,660
Would you like to give it a shot?

231
00:19:21,400 --> 00:19:25,520
Jiaxin! Let's skewer the food together.

232
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,739
Here. So many ingredients.

233
00:19:27,739 --> 00:19:29,480
You're right.

234
00:19:29,480 --> 00:19:32,340
Your cheongsam suits you very well.

235
00:19:32,900 --> 00:19:34,680
Thank you.

236
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:39,499
Is Mr. Xu joining us for team building today

237
00:19:39,500 --> 00:19:42,780
as Ms. Zhao's family member?

238
00:19:48,320 --> 00:19:50,560
It's up to Ms. Zhao to determine.

239
00:19:51,580 --> 00:19:53,740
Here's a punch. I...

240
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,760
I'm just practicing.

241
00:19:56,760 --> 00:19:58,320
Let's skewer the food, Mr. Xu.

242
00:19:58,320 --> 00:20:00,800
Come, let's do it since we're all here.

243
00:20:02,560 --> 00:20:06,520
It's been a long time since we last had our team building here.

244
00:20:06,520 --> 00:20:09,200
It's still the same here, nothing has changed.

245
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:11,700
Maybe this is the charm of an ancient town,

246
00:20:11,700 --> 00:20:15,540
giving people a feeling of stillness in time.

247
00:20:15,540 --> 00:20:19,559
I remember that you seemed to like eating the special ice cream here.

248
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:23,199
But you worked overtime with me and didn't get to eat it in the end. Right?

249
00:20:23,199 --> 00:20:26,439
Right. I was craving it back then.

250
00:20:26,439 --> 00:20:28,820
I wonder if it is still available now.

251
00:20:29,640 --> 00:20:32,280
I just saw an ice cream stand over there.

252
00:20:32,280 --> 00:20:34,060
I'm going over to get it now. Wait here for me.

253
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:36,660
I will make sure you have it today.

254
00:20:36,660 --> 00:20:38,180
Okay.

255
00:20:41,320 --> 00:20:43,799
Jiaxin, there's an ancient residence in front.

256
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:46,320
There must be something hidden there.

257
00:20:46,820 --> 00:20:48,120
Let's go take a look.

258
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,079
- No, I'm not going.
- Come on, let's go.

259
00:20:50,079 --> 00:20:51,359
Let's go. It's just right in front.

260
00:20:51,359 --> 00:20:53,400
<i>[Yi Garden]</i>

261
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:54,720
Look, it's closed.

262
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,440
Can this door be pushed open?

263
00:20:58,030 --> 00:21:02,120
Why don't you lead the way? Go.

264
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,000
Take a look.

265
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,060
Go on.

266
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:21,600
Jiaxin, let's go in...

267
00:21:23,800 --> 00:21:25,720
Jiaxin!

268
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,400
Gu Jiaxin!

269
00:21:30,380 --> 00:21:33,959
Jiaxin! Jiaxin!

270
00:21:33,959 --> 00:21:35,580
Gu Jiaxin!

271
00:21:35,580 --> 00:21:38,400
Jiaxin!

272
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:46,300
Jiaxin!

273
00:22:03,200 --> 00:22:04,399
You're alone?

274
00:22:04,399 --> 00:22:06,420
You're here at the right time. Pass me your phone.

275
00:22:06,420 --> 00:22:09,179
I was taking a stroll and got separated from Xu Ningyuan.

276
00:22:09,179 --> 00:22:11,400
I dropped my phone in the river.

277
00:22:20,620 --> 00:22:22,240
My phone battery has been depleted?

278
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,660
See.

279
00:22:25,080 --> 00:22:27,000
Where's Yanran?

280
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:34,220
She's disobedient, just like you.

281
00:22:34,220 --> 00:22:36,460
She got lost while roaming around.

282
00:22:36,460 --> 00:22:37,660
How did you guys get separated?

283
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:41,560
She insisted on going for... treasure hunting... to look for...

284
00:22:41,560 --> 00:22:45,699
Then she got hold of a map and thereafter, she was nowhere to be found.

285
00:22:47,500 --> 00:22:49,020
I thought you'd been here before?

286
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:50,559
Maybe we should look for them together.

287
00:22:50,559 --> 00:22:53,239
When I was here, I left before I had time to play.

288
00:22:53,239 --> 00:22:55,580
I'm not familiar with this place either.

289
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:59,460
That's easy.

290
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:01,100
No.

291
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:04,320
All the more reason for us to stay together.

292
00:23:05,040 --> 00:23:07,480
Let's look for them together.

293
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:09,960
There. It should be that way.

294
00:23:11,780 --> 00:23:13,420
You look better with your hair tied up.

295
00:23:13,420 --> 00:23:15,540
Let's go.

296
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:24,500
Have you figured it out yet?

297
00:23:24,500 --> 00:23:28,299
Yes, I have. It's somewhere around here.

298
00:23:28,299 --> 00:23:30,140
Come, over here.

299
00:23:30,140 --> 00:23:32,100
Is it here?

300
00:23:57,520 --> 00:23:59,040
Let's go.

301
00:24:04,780 --> 00:24:06,759
What are you doing behind me? You should lead the way.

302
00:24:06,759 --> 00:24:08,900
I'm protecting you. I...

303
00:24:08,900 --> 00:24:12,650
How do you protect me from behind? Move to the front.

304
00:24:17,240 --> 00:24:20,140
You're not scared, are you?

305
00:24:20,140 --> 00:24:24,380
Don't be ridiculous. Do I look like I'm scared?

306
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,960
I forgot that you're afraid of the dark.

307
00:24:34,960 --> 00:24:37,300
I'm not afraid.

308
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:41,580
I'm just thinking that we should respect

309
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:45,120
this ancestral home that has been around for hundreds of years.

310
00:24:47,560 --> 00:24:49,910
Scared of ghosts?

311
00:24:51,080 --> 00:24:55,920
Li Yanran! She's not here. Let's go.

312
00:24:55,920 --> 00:25:01,310
Okay. Since you're so scared, let's go.

313
00:25:02,370 --> 00:25:03,860
Hey.

314
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:11,400
Just a moment, please. The announcer will be right back.

315
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:18,880
Sir. Why are you here?

316
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,140
Jiang Yue and I got separated,

317
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:24,650
so I'm here to make an announcement.

318
00:25:25,280 --> 00:25:27,160
What about you?

319
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:31,599
I suspect I was dumped by Jiaxin, but I have no proof.

320
00:25:31,599 --> 00:25:33,200
His phone is also turned off.

321
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:36,759
I don't know if it ran out of power or if he did it on purpose.

322
00:25:36,759 --> 00:25:39,120
So I'm here to try my luck.

323
00:25:39,120 --> 00:25:41,460
If he really wants to get away from you,

324
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,760
you won't be able to find him no matter what.

325
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:44,960
You're so insensitive.

326
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:47,400
I believe that Jiaxin will not dump me on purpose.

327
00:25:47,400 --> 00:25:50,199
Even if he dumps me on purpose, I will not give up.

328
00:25:50,199 --> 00:25:51,720
Go register first.

329
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:54,940
At least you've to let him know you're waiting here for him.

330
00:25:55,540 --> 00:25:57,159
Hello. I'm registering to look for someone.

331
00:25:57,159 --> 00:25:58,730
Okay.

Madam, would you like to get a lantern?

334
00:26:10,420 --> 00:26:13,060
It's right there. They're pretty.

335
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:15,240
- Let's take a look.
- Let's go.

336
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:16,810
This way.

337
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,499
- Hi, Madam.
- How do you do?

338
00:26:22,499 --> 00:26:24,860
Are you looking for lanterns?

339
00:26:24,860 --> 00:26:26,400
Which one do you like? Take a look.

340
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,079
- This one.
- This?

341
00:26:28,079 --> 00:26:29,880
- Sure.
- We'll take two.

342
00:26:29,880 --> 00:26:32,819
All right. Here you go. Okay, thanks.

343
00:26:32,819 --> 00:26:35,119
By the way, the place for releasing river lamps is straight ahead,

344
00:26:35,119 --> 00:26:36,739
right across the bridge at the stone steps.

345
00:26:36,740 --> 00:26:38,499
- It's really beautiful there.
- Is it?

346
00:26:38,499 --> 00:26:40,999
- Thanks.
- Let's go take a look.

347
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,800
We better look for them first.

348
00:26:44,360 --> 00:26:45,900
The ancient town is huge.

349
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:48,520
We've searched for a long time and they're nowhere in sight.

350
00:26:48,520 --> 00:26:51,290
Why don't we meet them at the hotel?

351
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,640
- Maybe they're waiting there. Let's go check it out.
- All right.

352
00:26:55,640 --> 00:26:57,079
Great. Thank you, Madam.

353
00:26:57,079 --> 00:26:59,260
- No problem. Bye.
- Bye.

354
00:27:02,860 --> 00:27:05,320
- Don't rush. Walk slowly.
- It's okay, I'm fine.

355
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,019
- Slow down.
- Bro, look!

356
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:16,639
Quick, open it. Take a look.

Quick, take a look.

00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:21,820
- Great!
- I'll take another look.

<i>Missing person announcement. Missing person announcement.</i>

361

<i>Zhao Jiangyue and Gu Jiaxin from Link Technology.</i>

362
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:30,419
- Isn't Ms. Zhao with Mr. Xu?
- You're right.

363
00:27:30,419 --> 00:27:32,520
Jiaxin should be with Yanran.

364
00:27:32,520 --> 00:27:33,779
Shall we go look for them? Let's go.

365
00:27:33,780 --> 00:27:35,919
We're not looking for them. Let's look for the big prize instead.

366
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:37,580
You— They are grown-ups, they won't get lost.

367
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:39,139
- Let's go. Search for the big prize.
- Move.

368
00:27:39,139 --> 00:27:40,800
Yes.

369
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:48,170
Seems like we're on the wrong track.

370
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:50,800
It shouldn't be so far, right?

371
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:52,899
It's okay. Let's ask someone in front.

372
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,680
All right.

373
00:27:56,480 --> 00:27:58,079

- Okay.

Could you please tell us how to get to the place for releasing river lamps?

377
00:28:07,219 --> 00:28:10,290
It's just a few meters ahead.

A few meters.

380
00:28:15,940 --> 00:28:18,179
Seven meters ahead? Do we have to walk seven meters?

381
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:20,900
Why are you not able to understand?

382
00:28:20,900 --> 00:28:22,620
What spirit?

383
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:24,640
Still so high-spirited at this time of the night?

384
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:26,160
Probably not.

00:28:26,160 --> 00:28:28,320
Never mind. I got it. Thanks, Madam.

Thanks, Madam. Thanks a lot. Okay.

00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:33,380
It should be farther up.

388
00:28:33,380 --> 00:28:34,880
Right.

389
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:48,770
It's here.

00:28:50,300 --> 00:28:53,340
Look. It's beautiful.

391
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:55,180
I'll walk on that side.

00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:57,670
Be careful.

393
00:29:02,120 --> 00:29:03,500
Here.

Thanks for saving me today.

It's fine. As long as you're okay.

00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:31,300
But honestly, I think you're pretty strong.

398
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:33,360
If it wasn't for this accident today,

399
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:38,200
it would be hard for me to protect you.

400
00:29:40,500 --> 00:29:44,820
I'm used to it. I don't want to trouble anyone.

401
00:29:44,820 --> 00:29:49,000
As long as I can solve things on my own, I'd rather do it myself.

402
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:54,020
You can trouble me. I'm not afraid of trouble.

403
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:58,000
Just like today, as long as you need me,

404
00:29:58,000 --> 00:30:01,960
anytime, anywhere, I'll be there.

405
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:10,000
The announcement has been made for quite a while,

406
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,670
and we still can't find them.

407
00:30:14,620 --> 00:30:18,680
Sir, wishing lanterns.

408
00:30:20,560 --> 00:30:23,799
When you see this kind of wishing lanterns, you must make a wish.

409
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,390
This way, your dreams can come true.

410
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,500
Let's make a wish for each other.

411
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:38,700
Okay.

412
00:30:38,700 --> 00:30:40,230
Here.

413
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,280
Make a good wish.

414
00:30:46,980 --> 00:30:50,020
I hope this female devil beside me

415
00:30:50,020 --> 00:30:52,420
can treat me a little better,

416
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:57,020
and turn into a gentle lady.

417
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:59,270
I'm not gentle enough?

418
00:31:00,520 --> 00:31:02,300
My turn.

419
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:07,960
I hope this kid next to me can work diligently

420
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:11,259
and be tied to Link Technology for the rest of his life.

421
00:31:11,260 --> 00:31:13,500
Are you cursing me?

422
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:16,479
I'm not putting my lifetime happiness in the hands of the company.

423
00:31:16,479 --> 00:31:20,439
Then, why did you try to change my personality?

424
00:31:20,439 --> 00:31:24,100
I am... I... I want you to be happy for the rest of your life, is that wrong?

425
00:31:24,100 --> 00:31:25,620
I...

426
00:31:31,640 --> 00:31:34,140
What did you wish for?

427
00:31:34,140 --> 00:31:36,440
You can make your wish alone.

428
00:31:37,140 --> 00:31:39,420
Such a boring guy.

429
00:31:39,420 --> 00:31:42,490
All right. Let's go look for them again.

430
00:31:50,420 --> 00:31:54,600
I hope that Jiaxin can stay cheerful and happy forever.

431
00:31:58,580 --> 00:32:02,980
May there be someone to protect Jiangyue forever.

432
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:50,800
Are you okay?

433
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:53,100
I'm fine.

434
00:32:56,280 --> 00:32:58,150
Let me help you.

435
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:01,880
Okay.

436
00:33:11,620 --> 00:33:13,940
Isn't that Jiaxin?

437
00:33:13,940 --> 00:33:16,160
Why is he with Ms. Zhao again?

438
00:33:16,160 --> 00:33:19,580
The two of them are holding hands. Jiaxin!

439
00:33:30,320 --> 00:33:32,320

I found it. It's hidden here.

442

Jiaxin, you are my lucky star.

443
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:43,359
Being the organizer, you don't even know where the prizes are hidden?

444
00:33:43,359 --> 00:33:45,720
Although I'm the organizer,

445
00:33:45,720 --> 00:33:49,770
Zihao's in charge of hiding the prizes.

446
00:33:50,380 --> 00:33:53,959
Since we found the prize, why don't we plan for a trip somewhere?

447
00:33:53,959 --> 00:33:56,320
How about the Maldives?

448
00:33:56,320 --> 00:33:59,280
It's your prize. You make your own decision.

What's mine is yours. What's yours is still yours. Let's go.

450
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:04,940
Yanran, stop it. Enough.

451
00:34:10,320 --> 00:34:13,999
I'm sorry. You disappeared while I was getting the ice cream.
- Hurry up.

452
00:34:13,999 --> 00:34:17,190
- Stop that.
- It's really crowded today.

453
00:34:17,920 --> 00:34:21,170
If you're not feeling tired, let's have a talk later.

454
00:34:22,140 --> 00:34:23,900
Sure.

455
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:44,280
You got another one?

456
00:34:45,240 --> 00:34:48,140
I must let you have it today no matter what.

457
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,320
Jiangyue, there are actually some words

458
00:34:57,320 --> 00:35:00,160
that have been stored in my heart for a long time.

459
00:35:03,420 --> 00:35:07,820
I hope it is not too late to say these words.

460
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:10,300
When you were live streaming, you said

461
00:35:10,300 --> 00:35:12,860
you'd be in a relationship within three months.

462
00:35:12,860 --> 00:35:14,580
I've thought about it.

463
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:17,080
There's probably no one in the world

464
00:35:17,080 --> 00:35:19,850
more suitable for each other than us.

465
00:35:21,940 --> 00:35:23,970
Let's be together.

466
00:35:36,460 --> 00:35:38,840
Are you kidding me?

467
00:35:38,840 --> 00:35:40,740
I'm serious.

468
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:46,600
Are you worried that I won't be able to meet my relationship KPI?

469
00:35:46,600 --> 00:35:49,580
I'm sure I can take care of this myself.

470
00:35:54,380 --> 00:35:56,640
Remember this note?

471
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:01,860
This is your note to me when you left.
<i>[Today is my last day at work.]</i>

472
00:36:01,860 --> 00:36:06,360
I always carry it with me as a souvenir from you.

that I'm doing this to help you meet your KPI?

- Li Yanran's looking for you in your room.
- Right?

484
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:18,120
- Yes.
- Let's go.

485
00:37:18,120 --> 00:37:19,919
- Ms. Zhao.
- Let's go have some fun.

486
00:37:19,919 --> 00:37:21,579
- They're all here.
- Ms. Zhao is around.

487
00:37:21,579 --> 00:37:24,340
- Mr. Xu is here, too.
- Ms. Zhao.

488
00:37:24,340 --> 00:37:26,619
It's so boring. Shall we do something?

489
00:37:26,619 --> 00:37:28,519
I just saw a karaoke room downstairs.

490
00:37:28,519 --> 00:37:31,760
- Liang wants to go for a drink.
- I didn't say I want a drink.

491
00:37:31,760 --> 00:37:35,320
Well, let's go together.

492
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,599
- Let's go, Mr. Xu.
- Join us.
- Do you want to go?

493
00:37:39,560 --> 00:37:42,660
- Sure.
- We're going for a drink!

494
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:45,800
- Come on.
- Let's go.

495
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:49,160
Regarding what I said just now, do give it some thought.

00:38:54,880 --> 00:38:57,420
- Would you like another song, Ms. Zhao?
- One more song.

517
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:59,859
- One more.
- Come on.

518
00:38:59,860 --> 00:39:03,000
Well, let's play a game. We've sung for quite a while.

519
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:05,240
Fine. What game?

520
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,379
Let's play "I Have and You Don't."

521
00:39:07,379 --> 00:39:09,980
Who's played before?

522
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:11,640
Come. All right.

523
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:14,360
Let's go over the rules one more time.

524
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:17,559
Everyone will take turns to say something

525
00:39:17,559 --> 00:39:20,400
they have never done before.

526
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:25,360
If someone else has done it, drink.

527
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:27,200
- That's easy.
- Come on. Who's first?

528
00:39:27,200 --> 00:39:29,219
- Go ahead.
- You have to start first.

529
00:39:29,220 --> 00:39:31,640
You suggested it.

530
00:39:31,640 --> 00:39:33,859
- Say something.
- Say something.
- Can't you think of anything?

531
00:39:33,859 --> 00:39:36,160
Hurry up. Start now.

532
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:39,760
I've never written a love letter to anyone.

533
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:41,539
What is this?

534
00:39:41,539 --> 00:39:44,320
- It's meaningless.
- Drink.

535
00:39:44,320 --> 00:39:46,520
This wine is...

536
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,419
- Did you finish yours?
- That... That's too much for me.

537
00:39:53,120 --> 00:39:54,340
Come on. Let's continue.

538
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:57,940
I have never pursued someone before.

539
00:39:57,940 --> 00:40:01,200
Coincidentally, neither have I.

540
00:40:03,980 --> 00:40:06,079
- Cheers.
- Drink up.

541
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,200
- Drink.
- Drink up.

542
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,080
Come on, Ms. Zhao.

543
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:10,740
It's my turn.

544
00:40:12,820 --> 00:40:14,560
Apart from my parents,

545
00:40:14,560 --> 00:40:20,119
I've never said "I love you" to anyone.

546
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,840
Let's toast.

547
00:40:24,660 --> 00:40:28,280
Have I got you stumped? Drink up.

548
00:40:29,740 --> 00:40:33,460
I seem to have found the key to this game.

549
00:40:34,820 --> 00:40:37,920
Her expression looks threatening.

550
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:54,980
Listen to the next one.

551
00:40:54,980 --> 00:40:59,420
I've never been on leave.

552
00:40:59,420 --> 00:41:01,599
- Oh, my goodness.
- I can't take it anymore.

553
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:03,960
Yes, I can't drink anymore.

554
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:07,000
The next one.

555
00:41:08,020 --> 00:41:12,580
My phone has never been turned off.

556
00:41:12,580 --> 00:41:14,179
Your phone just dropped in the river.

557
00:41:14,179 --> 00:41:16,500
Right, I fell into the river.

558
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:18,320
- Drink up.
- Have some beer.

559
00:41:18,320 --> 00:41:19,779
- Drink up.
- Move to the next person.

560
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:21,519
- Quick. Go on.
- Mr. Xu. Mr. Xu.

561
00:41:21,519 --> 00:41:23,560
- Speed up.
- Quick.

562
00:41:23,560 --> 00:41:25,840
Okay. Here's one.

563
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:31,300
I've never screwed up a contract.

564
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:32,900
Me, too.

565
00:41:32,900 --> 00:41:35,500
You don't have to drink then.

566
00:41:35,500 --> 00:41:38,340
- Drink up!
- Drink, Mr. Xu.

567
00:41:38,340 --> 00:41:40,560
Well, fine. I-I-I...

568
00:41:40,560 --> 00:41:42,600
will stop drinking. Let's continue singing.

569
00:41:42,600 --> 00:41:44,200
I... I want to stop playing, too.

570
00:41:44,200 --> 00:41:47,100
I've... I've not played yet.

571
00:41:47,780 --> 00:41:50,600
- I want to sing.
- Let's sing.

572
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:53,860
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

573
00:41:53,860 --> 00:41:56,400
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

574
00:41:57,080 --> 00:41:59,579
Hey, Zihao. Zihao, where's the restroom?

575
00:41:59,579 --> 00:42:02,440
- Right, turn right. Turn right.
- Okay, good. I'm going there.

576
00:42:02,440 --> 00:42:04,900
You've drunk too much.

577
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:07,580
Come back soon.

578
00:42:07,580 --> 00:42:10,060
- I'll go take a look.
- Okay.

579
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:12,980
Let's drink. Bottoms up. Cheers.

580
00:42:12,980 --> 00:42:14,660
Okay, finish off.

581
00:42:14,660 --> 00:42:17,560
Here's to you. Drink up.

582
00:42:24,640 --> 00:42:27,120
Jiaxin, are you all right?

583
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,000
I'm fine, don't worry.

584
00:42:29,800 --> 00:42:32,819
- I'm good.
- You're feeling okay?

585
00:42:33,660 --> 00:42:37,600
You drank too much. Then... you... Where's your room?

586
00:42:37,600 --> 00:42:40,180
- Jiangyue.
- Yes?

587
00:42:40,180 --> 00:42:44,139
What did Xu Ningyuan say to you on the terrace tonight?

588
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:02,820
<i>[How to seize the initiation in love?]</i>

589
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:07,239
How to seize the initiation in love?

590
00:43:07,239 --> 00:43:08,919
That's a simple question.

591
00:43:08,919 --> 00:43:13,040
Love Note's beginner course has covered this.
<i>[Love Note]</i>

592
00:43:15,180 --> 00:43:17,499
To seize the initiation in love, the main thing

593
00:43:17,500 --> 00:43:20,999
is to learn how to replace affirmative thinking with filter thinking.

594
00:43:20,999 --> 00:43:23,079
Filter out the right people

595
00:43:23,079 --> 00:43:25,299
and maintain a space to get along with them

596
00:43:25,300 --> 00:43:27,339
in search of happiness in love.

597
00:43:27,339 --> 00:43:29,439
Girls engaging in filter thinking

598
00:43:29,439 --> 00:43:32,099
will not worry about gains and losses that come along with love.

599
00:43:32,100 --> 00:43:34,299
But for girls engaging in affirmative thinking,

600
00:43:34,300 --> 00:43:37,079
every single move made by the other party

601
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:40,360
can result in an emotional wreck,

602
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:42,660
and they're hurt easily.

603
00:43:45,160 --> 00:43:48,419
In addition, filter thinking is more likely to create

604
00:43:48,419 --> 00:43:51,059
a relaxed and pleasant atmosphere.

605
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,440
When a person gets along well with another person and are happy together,

606
00:43:54,500 --> 00:43:56,700
their relationship will get better and better,

607
00:43:56,780 --> 00:43:58,699
their hearts will continue to flutter,

608
00:43:58,699 --> 00:44:02,080
and it's easy to harvest love that comes naturally.

609
00:44:02,080 --> 00:44:05,740
So... do you get it?

610
00:44:05,740 --> 00:44:09,939
Girls, never worry about gains and losses because of men.

611
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:13,000
The forest is large with all kinds of birds

612
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:15,360
so why do you have to focus on just one tree?

613
00:44:15,360 --> 00:44:17,880
<i>How about your Jiaxin?</i>

614
00:44:19,960 --> 00:44:22,160
Jiaxin is an exception.

615
00:44:22,160 --> 00:44:25,040
And we've been engaged since we were children.

616
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:26,960
I don't call this affirmative thinking.

617
00:44:26,960 --> 00:44:30,200
I'm honoring the spirit of a contract.

618
00:44:31,620 --> 00:44:34,300
<i>- Double standard.
- That's right.
- Just paying lip service.</i>

619
