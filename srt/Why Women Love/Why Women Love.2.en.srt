00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,100
What range?

162
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,300
Here's the thing.

163
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:52,400
When filling in their request for blind dates, 99% of men put the desired age range

164
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:55,600
of their partners as 19 to 29 years old.

165

A woman like you who is older and outstanding

190

Miss Zhao, here's the thing.

192
00:11:05,739 --> 00:11:09,179
My advice is for you to change your matchmaking profile

193
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,399
and lower part of your profile appropriately.

194
00:11:11,400 --> 00:11:15,179
You can lower your salary to the income of a regular female white-collar,

195
00:11:15,179 --> 00:11:19,349
or you can add in a few likes and hobbies such as

196
00:11:19,350 --> 00:11:21,570

197

00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:26,989
What's wrong with being excellent? Why do I have to hide it?

199
00:11:26,989 --> 00:11:30,349
Men don't like women who are better than them.

200
00:11:30,350 --> 00:11:33,169
Someone who can be a good wife and a good mother is what's popular.

201
00:11:33,169 --> 00:11:36,499
Older women who are too outstanding are more difficult to find love.

202

Why do men like women who are not as good as you?

is about supporting each other and growing together.

279

482
00:30:15,545 --> 00:30:16,664
Six ones! Six ones. <i>(A drinking game)</i>

483
00:30:16,665 --> 00:30:18,524
Six ones, open!

484
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:19,845
Yes!

485
00:30:19,845 --> 00:30:21,765
Here, here.

486
00:30:23,905 --> 00:30:25,095
Fill it up.

487
00:30:25,095 --> 00:30:26,845
I can't.

488
00:30:34,215 --> 00:30:36,385
Let's continue.

489
00:30:36,385 --> 00:30:38,045
- Cover me.
- What is it?

490
00:30:38,045 --> 00:30:39,785
The female devil is here.

491
00:30:44,135 --> 00:30:46,194
No, I'm sorry. I'll leave first.

492
00:30:46,194 --> 00:30:47,755
Don't go!

493
00:30:49,585 --> 00:30:51,275
Come on, drink!

494
00:31:13,025 --> 00:31:14,094
Gu Jiaxin.

495
00:31:14,095 --> 00:31:16,584
- Who are you?
- Sorry. Sorry.

496
00:31:27,455 --> 00:31:28,995
Come back here.

497
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:33,805
What a coincidence.

498
00:31:33,805 --> 00:31:36,184
It's late, so I'm going back first.

499
00:31:36,185 --> 00:31:37,465
Get back here.

500
00:31:37,465 --> 00:31:39,875
Let me ask you. What happened with the applet?

501
00:31:39,875 --> 00:31:40,944
What do you mean?

502
00:31:40,945 --> 00:31:42,925
Did you do it yourself?

503
00:31:42,925 --> 00:31:44,855
I did it.

504
00:31:46,305 --> 00:31:47,134
What's wrong?

505
00:31:47,135 --> 00:31:51,154
Our questionnaire content is exactly the same as aimeng.com's.

506
00:31:51,154 --> 00:31:53,335
Does it have anything to do with you?

507
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:56,555
Wait.

508
00:31:57,065 --> 00:31:59,095
Sister Lu wouldn't do that to me, right?

509
00:31:59,095 --> 00:32:01,425
Wang Lu from aimeng.com?

510
00:32:01,855 --> 00:32:03,405
We're quite close.

511
00:32:03,405 --> 00:32:05,704
You asked Wang Lu to help you do the applet?

512
00:32:05,705 --> 00:32:07,614
Don't you know what happened between us?

513
00:32:07,615 --> 00:32:08,875
What?

514
00:32:08,875 --> 00:32:11,184
I just joined the workforce, so I...

515
00:32:11,185 --> 00:32:13,304
How would I know all these things?

516
00:32:13,305 --> 00:32:15,374
I'm very closed with Sister Lu.

517
00:32:15,375 --> 00:32:17,525
She won't harm me.

518
00:32:17,525 --> 00:32:19,955
- It must be a misunderstanding.
- Misunderstanding?

519
00:32:19,955 --> 00:32:23,784
Do you know how many people from the operation department worked tirelessly on this?

520
00:32:23,785 --> 00:32:25,584
It's fine if you don't treasure the fruits of your own labor,

521
00:32:25,585 --> 00:32:27,734
but don't waste everyone else's.

522
00:32:27,735 --> 00:32:30,704
We were going to release it tomorrow, now we have to redo everything!

523
00:32:30,704 --> 00:32:34,644
Gu Jiaxin, if the company gets into a legal dispute over this matter,

524
00:32:34,644 --> 00:32:37,195
both of us will have to face serious consequences!

525
00:32:55,200 --> 00:32:57,500
How about this? I'll change the password.

526
00:32:57,505 --> 00:33:00,384
You collate and import the database for the questionnaire.

527
00:33:00,385 --> 00:33:02,045
Do we have time?

528
00:33:02,475 --> 00:33:05,085
It shouldn't be a problem if we work through the night.

529
00:33:05,085 --> 00:33:06,424
Thank you.

530
00:33:06,425 --> 00:33:07,754
Ms. Zhao will give you a bonus.

531
00:33:07,755 --> 00:33:09,325
Let's do this!

532
00:33:18,635 --> 00:33:23,005
Zihao, I'll do it with you.

533
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:24,805
You know how to do this?

534
00:33:24,805 --> 00:33:27,205
Wild Code Monkey, right?

535
00:33:27,205 --> 00:33:30,825
If you knew, why did you go get a template from another company?

536
00:33:30,825 --> 00:33:34,975
I thought it would be similar, and I was lazy.

537
00:33:35,665 --> 00:33:38,365
I didn't mean to create such a problem.

538
00:33:38,365 --> 00:33:41,505
I'm sorry for causing all of you to work overtime.

539
00:33:42,265 --> 00:33:43,664
Sit down and let's do it together.

540
00:33:43,665 --> 00:33:45,235
Ms. Zhao wants it urgently.

541
00:33:45,235 --> 00:33:46,635
Here.

542
00:33:46,635 --> 00:33:49,235
There's one part here that's pretty difficult.

543
00:33:54,165 --> 00:33:56,655
- Why don't you do it?
- No.

544
00:33:56,655 --> 00:33:58,455
- I...
- Come on.

545
00:33:58,455 --> 00:34:00,485
I know you can do it.

546
00:34:03,145 --> 00:34:05,304
You just need to pull out this problem area.

547
00:34:05,305 --> 00:34:06,895
Try it.

548
00:34:07,355 --> 00:34:09,115
I'll try.

549
00:35:00,395 --> 00:35:01,925
Come in.

550
00:35:03,155 --> 00:35:04,814
- Is it all done?
- Yes.

551
00:35:04,814 --> 00:35:08,174
This version can be said to be an improvement of the previous one. We optimized a lot of content.

552
00:35:08,174 --> 00:35:11,165
In such a short time, we wouldn't have been able to do it, but it was good that Jiaxin helped.

553
00:35:11,165 --> 00:35:13,604
He actually does have some skills and knows his stuff.

554
00:35:13,604 --> 00:35:15,025
Okay.

555
00:35:15,025 --> 00:35:16,924
You worked hard. Hurry and go back to rest.

556
00:35:16,924 --> 00:35:18,345
Okay.

557
00:35:43,465 --> 00:35:45,155
You're awake?

558
00:35:47,195 --> 00:35:49,085
What's wrong with your leg?

559
00:35:49,785 --> 00:35:52,534
You've been sitting too long. Your blood hasn't been circulating.

560
00:35:53,705 --> 00:35:56,284
Come on, let me. Don't, don't.

561
00:35:56,284 --> 00:35:58,885
Stand up and walk.

562
00:35:58,885 --> 00:36:00,835
Why is it numb?

563
00:36:02,025 --> 00:36:05,624
Do you know how many problems you created for everyone today?

564
00:36:06,835 --> 00:36:09,135
I'm sorry.

565
00:36:09,135 --> 00:36:11,304
I really didn't expect this would happen.

566
00:36:11,305 --> 00:36:14,135
Even though I don't want to stay in the company,

567
00:36:14,135 --> 00:36:17,705
but I never wanted to harm the company.

568
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:21,395
All right, it's been solved.

569
00:36:21,395 --> 00:36:23,304
You worked hard all night as well.

570
00:36:23,305 --> 00:36:24,905
Go home and rest.

571
00:36:24,905 --> 00:36:26,575
Okay.

572
00:36:31,305 --> 00:36:32,985
Why...

573
00:36:37,235 --> 00:36:39,165
Stop pretending.

574
00:37:26,875 --> 00:37:28,105
Ms. Zhao.

575
00:37:28,105 --> 00:37:30,235
Who are you?

576
00:37:30,235 --> 00:37:32,005
I'm your assistant.

577
00:37:32,005 --> 00:37:33,065
What is it?

578
00:37:33,065 --> 00:37:34,815
I'll treat you to a meal.

579
00:37:34,815 --> 00:37:36,975
A meal?

580
00:37:39,945 --> 00:37:41,735
Stay there. I'll do it.

581
00:37:41,735 --> 00:37:44,265
- I...
- Here, Ms. Zhao. Excuse me.

582
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:53,175
How about you take one side?

583
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:55,515
Here, here.

584
00:37:55,515 --> 00:37:56,944
All right.

585
00:37:56,945 --> 00:37:59,595
I didn't order anything.

586
00:38:03,205 --> 00:38:06,045
Ms. Zhao, I'm sorry.

587
00:38:06,045 --> 00:38:08,835
About the applet, I was wrong.

588
00:38:08,835 --> 00:38:12,534
Please don't hold a grudge against me and forgive me.

589
00:38:12,534 --> 00:38:14,585
Please don't use work as a reason

590
00:38:14,585 --> 00:38:19,764
to get back at me, especially by telling my mother.

591
00:38:19,764 --> 00:38:23,304
If you can use this energy on work,

592
00:38:23,305 --> 00:38:24,845
you'd be really great.

593
00:38:24,845 --> 00:38:28,115
This has to go hand in hand with work.

594
00:38:28,115 --> 00:38:29,805
Come on, eat.

595
00:38:29,805 --> 00:38:31,095
I made all these by myself.

596
00:38:31,095 --> 00:38:32,625
Try it.

597
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:34,735
It looks pretty good.

598
00:38:35,465 --> 00:38:37,105
I've been away from home,

599
00:38:37,105 --> 00:38:39,935
so I need to at least know how to make a few dishes.

600
00:38:39,935 --> 00:38:41,835
Do you have chopsticks?

<i>[Order for Takeout]</i>
I can see that you really sincerely ordered takeout.

602

You didn't even try to hide such an important clue.

603
00:39:11,885 --> 00:39:13,735
Yes.

604
00:39:13,735 --> 00:39:16,395
Here. This restaurant has pretty good food.

605
00:39:16,395 --> 00:39:18,784
I... Well... I'll send it to you.

606
00:39:18,784 --> 00:39:20,335

Okay.

Whatever you say.

613
00:39:39,875 --> 00:39:42,515
Ms. Zhao, your tap is not working.

614
00:39:42,515 --> 00:39:44,025
What's wrong? Let me see.

615
00:39:44,025 --> 00:39:46,665
Do you have tools? I'll help you fix it.

616
00:39:46,665 --> 00:39:49,314
No need. You won't be able to.

617
00:39:49,314 --> 00:39:51,065
Stand back.

618
00:40:09,495 --> 00:40:14,205
Miss, you have too many skills.

619
00:40:14,205 --> 00:40:15,915
Can you let us men live?

620
00:40:15,915 --> 00:40:19,115
I just want to keep you men from living.

621
00:40:19,115 --> 00:40:23,585
At this time, you should show how helpless you are

622
00:40:23,585 --> 00:40:25,645
and ask a man for help.

623
00:40:25,645 --> 00:40:27,135
For example, me.

624
00:40:27,135 --> 00:40:28,845
That isn't necessary.

625
00:40:28,845 --> 00:40:30,844
- Let me help you.
- No need.

626
00:40:30,844 --> 00:40:34,095
This is such a small issue, I don't need your help.

627

What... What the heck!

628
00:40:42,315 --> 00:40:43,834
See, I told you I would help you.

00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:47,385
Hurry and get over here! What are you doing there?

630

- Hurry up!
- Use your hand.

631
00:40:49,975 --> 00:40:51,495
Block it. Block it.

632
00:40:51,495 --> 00:40:53,675
Why is there more coming out?

633
00:40:53,675 --> 00:40:55,835

"How to lock down another person's heart?"

639

Love Note has a theory on love

640
00:41:29,815 --> 00:41:31,865
called Love Anchor Theory.

641
00:41:31,865 --> 00:41:37,365
Love Anchor refers to the connection tool between things and emotions.

642
00:41:37,400 --> 00:41:45,000
For example, when we hear a familiar song or smell a familiar smell, we will... think of something familiar.

643
00:41:45,115 --> 00:41:48,275
It's a special switch for emotions.

you can use some of these small tricks or habits

646
00:41:57,305 --> 00:41:59,845
to throw down your love anchor for him.

647
00:41:59,845 --> 00:42:02,495
For example, playing music that you like on a loop.

648
00:42:02,495 --> 00:42:05,725
For example, asking him to buy you your favorite drink.

649
00:42:05,725 --> 00:42:09,734
For example, picking a unique nickname for him.

650
00:42:09,734 --> 00:42:11,535
<i>Little Jiaxin!</i>

651
00:42:11,535 --> 00:42:13,195
Something like that.

652
00:42:13,195 --> 00:42:17,075
After that, every time you listen to this song or

653
00:42:17,075 --> 00:42:19,975
have this drink, or when you hear this nickname...

654
00:42:19,975 --> 00:42:21,395
<i>Little Jiaxin!</i>

655
00:42:21,395 --> 00:42:24,875
...you will unconsciously think of him.

656
00:42:25,455 --> 00:42:28,065
No one can resist the power of a love anchor, so

657
00:42:28,065 --> 00:42:31,025
hurry and throw down the love anchor in your life

658
00:42:31,025 --> 00:42:33,285
and lock down your love for him.

659
00:42:33,285 --> 00:42:36,165
No, his love for you.

660
00:42:36,165 --> 00:42:39,994
I'm Gu Jiaxin, who knows how to race and how to date.

661
00:42:40,795 --> 00:42:44,675
- See you next time.
- <i>Gu Jiaxin! Where's my coffee?</i>

662
00:42:45,905 --> 00:42:47,485
Coming!
