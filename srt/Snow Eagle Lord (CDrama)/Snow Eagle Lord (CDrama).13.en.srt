Are you alright?

22
00:01:57,745 --> 00:01:58,305
I'm fine.

23
00:01:58,546 --> 00:02:00,546
You don't even have Transcendent Dou Qi.

24
00:02:04,786 --> 00:02:06,546
Dou Qi comes from desires.

25
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:08,706
Desires come from minds.

26
00:02:08,986 --> 00:02:10,585
Becoming immortal from ashes.

27
00:02:10,666 --> 00:02:13,226
Practice Qi from Energy
to become a deity.

28
00:02:13,305 --> 00:02:15,585
Your Qi and blood will change
as your muscles and bones change.

29
00:02:15,666 --> 00:02:17,986
You can go out once you made it.

30
00:02:19,345 --> 00:02:20,106
Sir.

31
00:02:23,465 --> 00:02:24,506
This seems

32
00:02:24,625 --> 00:02:26,025
a book for fire cultivators.

33
00:02:26,106 --> 00:02:26,625
Maybe

34
00:02:26,706 --> 00:02:28,065
this is his guidance to you.

35
00:02:28,905 --> 00:02:29,465
I didn't expect

36
00:02:29,585 --> 00:02:30,745
there would be other people

37
00:02:30,986 --> 00:02:32,465
at the bottom of the Black Wind Cliff.

38
00:02:32,625 --> 00:02:33,426
Not the same.

39
00:02:33,585 --> 00:02:34,585
We're trapped here,

40
00:02:34,666 --> 00:02:35,305
unable to leave.

41
00:02:35,426 --> 00:02:36,426
But the owner of this place

42
00:02:36,546 --> 00:02:37,506
comes and goes freely.

43
00:02:37,666 --> 00:02:39,106
The level of the senior

44
00:02:39,226 --> 00:02:40,506
must be above the Transcendent Level.

45
00:02:41,905 --> 00:02:43,386
Study this book,

46
00:02:43,506 --> 00:02:44,986
and we might be able to leave soon.

47
00:03:23,192 --> 00:03:25,720
(Deity Meaning of Fire)

48
00:03:33,865 --> 00:03:35,826
Xueying, the fish is done.

49
00:03:44,785 --> 00:03:46,106
Who are you?

50
00:03:46,226 --> 00:03:47,585
- Demon God Cult.
- Demon God Cult.

51
00:03:47,706 --> 00:03:49,465
Who is your master?

52
00:03:49,585 --> 00:03:50,905
- Demon God Cult.
- Demon God Cult.

53
00:03:51,386 --> 00:03:52,666
Who are you?

54
00:03:52,745 --> 00:03:54,106
- Demon God Cult.
- Demon God Cult.

55
00:03:54,226 --> 00:03:56,106
Who is your master?

56
00:03:56,185 --> 00:03:57,625
- Demon God Cult.
- Demon God Cult.

57
00:04:06,506 --> 00:04:07,506
Congratulations, master,

58
00:04:07,706 --> 00:04:08,986
on gaining new strength.

59
00:04:09,745 --> 00:04:11,266
This is far from enough.

60
00:04:11,386 --> 00:04:12,266
I need

61
00:04:12,345 --> 00:04:14,106
more powerful warriors.

62
00:04:14,305 --> 00:04:14,946
Yes.

63
00:04:15,826 --> 00:04:16,626
But since we

64
00:04:16,706 --> 00:04:17,706
need more warriors,

65
00:04:17,826 --> 00:04:19,225
why did we let Dongbo Xueying

66
00:04:19,345 --> 00:04:20,665
and that woman leave?

67
00:04:24,066 --> 00:04:25,266
When does

68
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:25,905
my decision

69
00:04:26,025 --> 00:04:27,545
need your approval?

70
00:04:27,785 --> 00:04:29,225
I was just worried

71
00:04:29,465 --> 00:04:30,946
that because of
not knowing the reasons,

72
00:04:31,186 --> 00:04:32,585
I would hinder your grand plan.

73
00:04:32,665 --> 00:04:33,585
Dongbo Xueying

74
00:04:33,585 --> 00:04:35,706
fell from the towering Black Wind Cliff

75
00:04:35,746 --> 00:04:36,626
and could be still alive.

76
00:04:36,706 --> 00:04:38,186
There must be something extraordinary
about him.

77
00:04:38,266 --> 00:04:39,066
Moreover,

78
00:04:39,146 --> 00:04:39,866
within his body

79
00:04:39,946 --> 00:04:41,626
flows the blood of Moyang Yu.

80
00:04:41,946 --> 00:04:43,146
Moyang Yu.

81
00:04:44,066 --> 00:04:45,386
The Ancient Bloodline.

82
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:46,826
But today,

83
00:04:46,946 --> 00:04:47,985
when I tested him,

84
00:04:48,186 --> 00:04:48,785
it seemed...

85
00:04:48,785 --> 00:04:49,545
So,

86
00:04:49,585 --> 00:04:51,425
I asked you to give him
the cultivation book,

87
00:04:51,545 --> 00:04:52,465
forcing him

88
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,306
to break through

89
00:04:53,386 --> 00:04:55,146
the limit of bloodline power.

90
00:04:55,345 --> 00:04:57,066
If he really has the Ancient Bloodline,

91
00:04:57,146 --> 00:04:58,746
his continued practice

92
00:04:58,826 --> 00:05:00,386
will be like heating up oil
on a blazing fire.

93
00:05:00,506 --> 00:05:01,905
One mistake, and he will...

94
00:05:02,025 --> 00:05:03,345
Turning to ashes.

95
00:05:03,866 --> 00:05:06,266
Brilliant, truly brilliant.

96
00:05:06,386 --> 00:05:07,066
But if he

97
00:05:07,186 --> 00:05:07,985
doesn't have

98
00:05:08,066 --> 00:05:09,785
the Ancient Bloodline...

99
00:05:09,905 --> 00:05:10,866
I know.

100
00:05:11,665 --> 00:05:13,785
If he can't be used by us,

101
00:05:13,985 --> 00:05:15,425
I will never let them

102
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:17,186
leave here alive.

103
00:05:18,345 --> 00:05:19,545
Clever.

104
00:05:28,545 --> 00:05:30,386
Master, I beg you.

105
00:05:30,465 --> 00:05:32,225
Please teach me Lightning Techniques.

106
00:05:34,585 --> 00:05:35,746
Master,

107
00:05:36,105 --> 00:05:38,146
Qingshi is quite serious about practice.

108
00:05:38,425 --> 00:05:40,345
He won't disappoint your teachings.

109
00:05:40,585 --> 00:05:42,025
Please teach him.

110
00:05:43,386 --> 00:05:44,465
Lightning Techniques

111
00:05:44,585 --> 00:05:45,746
are the most powerful ones

112
00:05:45,826 --> 00:05:47,105
of all techniques,

113
00:05:47,425 --> 00:05:49,465
but they're the most difficult
to control.

114
00:05:49,626 --> 00:05:51,225
A strong foundation is a must.

115
00:05:51,465 --> 00:05:52,146
Qingshi,

116
00:05:52,266 --> 00:05:54,025
with your current abilities,

117
00:05:54,506 --> 00:05:55,626
rashly learning them

118
00:05:55,985 --> 00:05:57,425
can easily hurt you.

119
00:05:57,545 --> 00:05:58,985
I'm not afraid, Master.

120
00:05:59,105 --> 00:06:01,186
As the saying goes,

121
00:06:01,266 --> 00:06:02,386
"pain leads to success."

122
00:06:02,545 --> 00:06:03,465
Without getting hurt,

123
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:04,665
how can I grow?

124
00:06:10,225 --> 00:06:12,146
Master, I beg you,

125
00:06:12,146 --> 00:06:13,266
please teach me.

126
00:06:13,386 --> 00:06:14,826
I'll study hard

127
00:06:14,946 --> 00:06:16,066
and be careful.

128
00:06:16,866 --> 00:06:18,186
How is the tea gone?

129
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:19,465
Rong.

130
00:06:19,626 --> 00:06:21,386
Let me do it.

131
00:06:27,386 --> 00:06:28,186
Here you are.

132
00:06:28,306 --> 00:06:29,386
Master, please enjoy the tea.

133
00:06:29,746 --> 00:06:30,866
Let me tell you.

134
00:06:31,146 --> 00:06:32,506
Be careful not to get blown up

135
00:06:32,626 --> 00:06:34,105
by Lightning Techniques.

136
00:06:34,626 --> 00:06:35,266
Yes.

137
00:06:51,225 --> 00:06:52,425
Lightning Techniques

138
00:06:52,706 --> 00:06:54,066
really live up to their reputation.

139
00:07:20,186 --> 00:07:20,946
Master.

140
00:07:21,105 --> 00:07:21,626
Don't worry.

141
00:07:35,506 --> 00:07:36,345
Qingshi,

142
00:07:36,985 --> 00:07:37,985
don't worry.

143
00:07:38,146 --> 00:07:39,266
I've said it before.

144
00:07:39,345 --> 00:07:40,985
It is difficult to learn the techniques.

145
00:07:41,306 --> 00:07:43,266
Rome wasn't built in a day.

146
00:07:43,785 --> 00:07:44,866
You practice slowly.

147
00:07:45,025 --> 00:07:46,425
Y-Y-You watch him here.

148
00:07:47,025 --> 00:07:47,665
Master.

149
00:08:25,306 --> 00:08:26,626
What's wrong?

150
00:08:26,826 --> 00:08:27,905
It's weird.

151
00:08:28,025 --> 00:08:29,345
Is there still residual electricity?

152
00:08:29,946 --> 00:08:30,665
Rong,

153
00:08:30,785 --> 00:08:32,185
why am I so stupid?

154
00:08:32,386 --> 00:08:34,065
Not only did I not
master the techniques,

155
00:08:34,266 --> 00:08:35,986
but I also made myself look so pathetic,

156
00:08:36,386 --> 00:08:37,986
making you and Master laugh at me.

157
00:08:38,106 --> 00:08:39,386
Don't talk nonsense.

158
00:08:39,506 --> 00:08:40,785
We didn't laugh at you.

159
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:42,626
Why can't I learn them?

160
00:08:43,226 --> 00:08:45,266
Most likely, you haven't grasped

161
00:08:45,266 --> 00:08:46,305
the key yet.

162
00:08:46,425 --> 00:08:47,825
You used to learn Ice Techniques,

163
00:08:47,825 --> 00:08:48,466
right?

164
00:08:48,545 --> 00:08:49,106
Yes.

165
00:08:49,466 --> 00:08:51,386
Ice Techniques emphasize

166
00:08:51,386 --> 00:08:52,905
instantaneous bursts,

167
00:08:53,025 --> 00:08:54,346
while Lightning Techniques

168
00:08:54,586 --> 00:08:56,305
require gradual progression.

169
00:08:56,785 --> 00:08:58,146
It's useless

170
00:08:58,146 --> 00:08:58,905
to start off too forcefully

171
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,386
because lightning is irregular

172
00:09:00,466 --> 00:09:01,545
in its occurrence.

173
00:09:01,665 --> 00:09:02,386
So

174
00:09:02,466 --> 00:09:03,146
in the beginning,

175
00:09:03,226 --> 00:09:04,305
you don't need to focus all your energy

176
00:09:04,386 --> 00:09:05,905
on one spot.

177
00:09:06,025 --> 00:09:07,025
That's right, Rong.

178
00:09:07,185 --> 00:09:08,226
You make sense.

179
00:09:08,545 --> 00:09:09,866
Let me apply medicine for you first.

180
00:09:12,545 --> 00:09:13,146
Well,

181
00:09:13,785 --> 00:09:15,705
there's no more electricity, right?

182
00:09:15,905 --> 00:09:16,586
Or else,

183
00:09:16,825 --> 00:09:17,785
I'll just bear with it.

184
00:09:23,545 --> 00:09:24,545
No more electricity.

185
00:09:37,226 --> 00:09:37,945
Great.

186
00:09:37,945 --> 00:09:39,586
Finally, no more electricity.

187
00:09:39,626 --> 00:09:40,626
Great, Rong.

188
00:09:42,025 --> 00:09:43,785
I'm so happy.

189
00:09:44,746 --> 00:09:45,905
Rong.

190
00:09:49,025 --> 00:09:50,545
Rong, I'll try again.

I finally succeeded.

203
00:11:17,386 --> 00:11:18,025
Sir.

204
00:11:18,945 --> 00:11:21,106
Man, it's you again.

205
00:11:21,705 --> 00:11:23,185
Thank you for your guidance yesterday.

206
00:11:23,466 --> 00:11:24,825
I've learned a lot.

207
00:11:24,986 --> 00:11:25,866
But,

208
00:11:25,945 --> 00:11:27,466
there are still some things unclear.

209
00:11:27,586 --> 00:11:29,065
May I have more guidance from you?

210
00:11:29,986 --> 00:11:30,545
Let me see

211
00:11:30,665 --> 00:11:32,065
how well you've practiced.

212
00:11:32,065 --> 00:11:32,626
Yes.

213
00:11:46,545 --> 00:11:47,665
(Achieving this)

214
00:11:47,665 --> 00:11:48,586
(in just one night)

215
00:11:48,586 --> 00:11:49,945
(is remarkable,)

216
00:11:50,106 --> 00:11:50,905
(but he doesn't seem)

217
00:11:50,905 --> 00:11:52,785
(to have the Ancient Bloodline.)

218
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:55,386
With your current method,

219
00:11:55,506 --> 00:11:57,386
you won't be able
to cultivate Transcendent Dou Qi.

220
00:11:58,226 --> 00:11:59,425
I am awaiting your guidance.

221
00:11:59,545 --> 00:12:01,266
Actually, you have good talent.

222
00:12:01,626 --> 00:12:02,905
But...

223
00:12:04,146 --> 00:12:05,025
But what?

224
00:12:05,665 --> 00:12:06,545
But

225
00:12:06,545 --> 00:12:08,386
you are trapped by the constraints

226
00:12:08,506 --> 00:12:09,825
of this world.

227
00:12:09,945 --> 00:12:11,586
Becoming a Transcendent Knight

228
00:12:11,705 --> 00:12:13,266
is a pipe dream for you.

229
00:12:15,425 --> 00:12:17,586
But there are still ways.

230
00:12:18,425 --> 00:12:19,905
You mean...

231
00:12:20,025 --> 00:12:21,986
Here is the Black Wind God Palace.

232
00:12:22,346 --> 00:12:24,065
We possess the power to help one

233
00:12:24,185 --> 00:12:25,586
become a Transcendent Knight,
even a Demigod.

234
00:12:25,705 --> 00:12:27,185
Once you become a Transcendent Knight

235
00:12:27,266 --> 00:12:28,106
or even a Demigod,

236
00:12:28,185 --> 00:12:29,106
you don't have to care

237
00:12:29,226 --> 00:12:30,705
about the world's conventions.

238
00:12:30,825 --> 00:12:31,986
Sounds great.

239
00:12:32,266 --> 00:12:33,106
But there's no such thing

240
00:12:33,106 --> 00:12:34,106
as a free lunch in the world.

241
00:12:34,226 --> 00:12:35,506
With such great conditions,

242
00:12:35,665 --> 00:12:37,266
what do you want in return?

243
00:12:38,226 --> 00:12:40,266
It is simple.

244
00:12:40,386 --> 00:12:41,785
Pledge loyalty to me

245
00:12:42,785 --> 00:12:44,545
and follow

246
00:12:44,545 --> 00:12:45,626
all my commands,

247
00:12:46,146 --> 00:12:48,945
then I will help you
become a Transcendent Knight.

248
00:12:48,945 --> 00:12:49,545
No.

249
00:12:50,746 --> 00:12:52,185
I'm only loyal

250
00:12:52,386 --> 00:12:53,266
to my heart.

251
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:56,226
Don't you want to be Transcendent?

252
00:12:56,226 --> 00:12:56,785
Yes, I do,

253
00:12:57,185 --> 00:12:58,065
even in my dreams.

254
00:12:58,705 --> 00:13:00,266
But I can't betray my heart.

255
00:13:00,386 --> 00:13:01,185
That's right.

256
00:13:01,626 --> 00:13:02,785
If it's not ours,

257
00:13:02,785 --> 00:13:03,586
we don't want it.

258
00:13:03,785 --> 00:13:04,746
Xueying, let's go.

259
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:06,466
You can't leave.

260
00:13:06,626 --> 00:13:07,305
No one

261
00:13:07,386 --> 00:13:09,185
but us in the Black Wind God Palace

262
00:13:09,305 --> 00:13:11,346
has ever made it out
of the bottom of the valley.

263
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:13,025
That's okay.

264
00:13:13,305 --> 00:13:14,545
I think staying here

265
00:13:14,665 --> 00:13:15,825
isn't that bad.

266
00:13:16,825 --> 00:13:17,586
Sir.

267
00:13:18,025 --> 00:13:19,305
Please let me reconsider it.

268
00:13:20,106 --> 00:13:20,945
Okay.

269
00:13:21,065 --> 00:13:23,106
The door of the palace

270
00:13:23,226 --> 00:13:25,425
is always open for both of you.

271
00:13:26,626 --> 00:13:27,346
Let's go.

272
00:13:38,945 --> 00:13:39,705
Don't worry.

273
00:13:40,146 --> 00:13:41,386
We will find a way

274
00:13:41,386 --> 00:13:42,025
to leave.

275
00:13:43,025 --> 00:13:43,425
I think

276
00:13:43,425 --> 00:13:44,746
what you said just now wasn't bad.

277
00:13:45,506 --> 00:13:46,346
If you

278
00:13:46,665 --> 00:13:48,226
don't have to find your origins,

279
00:13:48,586 --> 00:13:49,945
and I don't have to find my mother,

280
00:13:50,986 --> 00:13:52,065
staying here forever

281
00:13:52,226 --> 00:13:53,425
will be a wonderful thing.

282
00:14:10,506 --> 00:14:11,506
See? Rong.

283
00:14:11,626 --> 00:14:12,425
I'm awesome, right?

284
00:14:12,665 --> 00:14:13,466
Qingshi,

285
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,106
just a few days passed,

286
00:14:15,185 --> 00:14:16,705
but you've improved so much.

287
00:14:16,825 --> 00:14:17,386
That's really good.

288
00:14:18,185 --> 00:14:19,266
Of course.

289
00:14:20,106 --> 00:14:21,305
But,

290
00:14:21,825 --> 00:14:22,425
I'm not very skilled

291
00:14:22,425 --> 00:14:23,945
at it yet.

292
00:14:25,626 --> 00:14:26,665
What are you doing
so early in the morning?

293
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:28,146
Hurry, hurry!

294
00:14:37,386 --> 00:14:38,626
Qingshi!

295
00:14:50,665 --> 00:14:52,945
Xueying, I knew you would come.

296
00:14:53,065 --> 00:14:54,386
No one can resist

297
00:14:54,386 --> 00:14:56,106
the temptation of becoming Transcendent.

298
00:14:56,226 --> 00:14:57,626
I'm not here for that.

299
00:14:58,146 --> 00:14:59,785
So what do you want?

300
00:15:00,866 --> 00:15:01,986
I can stay,

301
00:15:02,665 --> 00:15:04,106
but I want you

302
00:15:04,506 --> 00:15:05,905
to let Yu Jingqiu leave.

303
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:08,506
She is

304
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,226
that important to you?

305
00:15:10,346 --> 00:15:11,466
Jingqiu has lost

306
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:12,665
her parents since childhood.

307
00:15:13,825 --> 00:15:15,586
I can't let her lose her freedom.

308
00:15:17,705 --> 00:15:19,065
Please grant this request.

309
00:15:19,746 --> 00:15:21,065
As long as she can leave,

310
00:15:21,185 --> 00:15:23,425
I'll stay here as you wish.

311
00:15:23,586 --> 00:15:24,466
Alright.

312
00:15:24,785 --> 00:15:26,025
Deal.

313
00:15:26,305 --> 00:15:27,226
Servant,

314
00:15:27,746 --> 00:15:29,226
take him to rest.

315
00:15:30,506 --> 00:15:31,266
Yes.

316
00:15:31,545 --> 00:15:32,146
Please.

317
00:15:51,705 --> 00:15:52,866
Xueying.

318
00:15:54,065 --> 00:15:54,905
Xueying.

319
00:15:57,905 --> 00:15:58,945
Xueying.

320
00:16:00,146 --> 00:16:01,025
Xueying.

321
00:16:02,705 --> 00:16:04,305
(He must be practicing now.)

322
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:06,545
(This is a good opportunity.)

323
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:17,346
You've decided?

324
00:16:17,545 --> 00:16:18,185
Yes.

325
00:16:18,425 --> 00:16:20,146
As long as Xueying can leave this place,

326
00:16:20,226 --> 00:16:21,506
I'll stay and serve.

327
00:16:22,305 --> 00:16:23,226
Good.

328
00:16:23,626 --> 00:16:25,506
That's selfless.

329
00:16:25,705 --> 00:16:26,785
I promise you.

330
00:16:26,945 --> 00:16:28,266
When can he leave?

331
00:16:28,466 --> 00:16:29,545
Don't worry.

332
00:16:29,626 --> 00:16:31,065
I'll arrange it.

333
00:16:31,305 --> 00:16:32,185
Servant.

334
00:16:33,425 --> 00:16:34,746
You go rest first.

335
00:16:35,665 --> 00:16:36,466
Please.

336
00:16:45,386 --> 00:16:46,506
All arranged?

337
00:16:46,986 --> 00:16:47,986
Yes, High Priest,

338
00:16:48,025 --> 00:16:48,945
it's all arranged.

339
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:50,986
Keep an eye on those two,

340
00:16:50,986 --> 00:16:52,425
and don't let any of them leave.

341
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:53,106
Yes.

342
00:16:55,705 --> 00:16:57,386
High Priest, what's wrong?

343
00:16:57,586 --> 00:16:58,746
Seems like someone

344
00:16:58,866 --> 00:17:00,065
wasn't transformed thoroughly

345
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:02,545
and broke the barrier and escaped.

346
00:17:13,505 --> 00:17:14,225
What are you talking about?

347
00:17:22,505 --> 00:17:23,066
Go.

348
00:17:24,705 --> 00:17:25,386
Behave yourself.

349
00:17:28,146 --> 00:17:28,786
Hurry up.

350
00:17:30,306 --> 00:17:32,066
Sir, what's going on?

351
00:17:32,225 --> 00:17:33,346
Just

352
00:17:33,425 --> 00:17:34,306
a disobedient deserter.

353
00:17:34,505 --> 00:17:37,185
We'll discipline him well
after taking him back.

354
00:17:39,026 --> 00:17:40,106
You rest well.

355
00:17:40,265 --> 00:17:41,425
Tomorrow I'll give you

356
00:17:41,425 --> 00:17:42,465
a big gift.

357
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,905
Now that you've joined
the Black Wind God Palace,

358
00:17:47,026 --> 00:17:48,546
you must be wholeheartedly loyal.

359
00:17:48,665 --> 00:17:51,185
Otherwise, there's only one path, death.

360
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:58,786
Youyue,

361
00:18:00,745 --> 00:18:02,106
I brought you some food.

362
00:18:03,626 --> 00:18:04,546
Where are you going?

363
00:18:04,705 --> 00:18:05,306
I...

364
00:18:05,465 --> 00:18:07,066
I want to go home.

365
00:18:07,265 --> 00:18:08,945
You want to go home at this time?

366
00:18:11,306 --> 00:18:12,465
Then I'll go with you.

367
00:18:12,626 --> 00:18:14,026
I'm going to my home.

368
00:18:14,185 --> 00:18:15,465
Why should I bring you along?

369
00:18:16,626 --> 00:18:17,306
Youyue,

370
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:20,866
we're friends, right?

371
00:18:20,985 --> 00:18:22,586
Although my martial arts skills
aren't that great,

372
00:18:22,705 --> 00:18:23,866
I'm still willing

373
00:18:24,026 --> 00:18:24,945
to take a hit

374
00:18:25,066 --> 00:18:26,546
for a friend like you.

375
00:18:27,985 --> 00:18:28,705
There's a rat!

376
00:18:28,705 --> 00:18:29,546
Rat!

377
00:18:29,546 --> 00:18:31,146
O-O-Oh, where's the rat?

378
00:18:31,146 --> 00:18:31,905
Where is it? Where?

379
00:18:31,905 --> 00:18:33,866
Didn't you say you'd take a hit?

380
00:18:42,386 --> 00:18:45,026
Well, anything else is fine,

381
00:18:45,185 --> 00:18:45,786
but handling rats

382
00:18:45,786 --> 00:18:46,866
is not within the scope.

383
00:18:47,026 --> 00:18:48,626
You're a grown-up.

384
00:18:48,665 --> 00:18:49,185
How can you still be afraid

385
00:18:49,185 --> 00:18:50,786
of such a small rat?

386
00:18:51,106 --> 00:18:52,265
I'm scared,

387
00:18:52,306 --> 00:18:53,626
but I can perform Shadow Steps.

388
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:54,786
Even if there really are rats,

389
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:56,066
I'll protect you.

390
00:18:58,066 --> 00:19:00,225
(His Shadow Steps)

391
00:19:00,346 --> 00:19:01,465
(can help me get home)

392
00:19:01,465 --> 00:19:02,945
(without anyone noticing.)

393
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,945
If you use Shadow Steps

394
00:19:09,106 --> 00:19:10,146
to take me out,

395
00:19:10,306 --> 00:19:11,346
I'll take you home.

396
00:19:11,505 --> 00:19:11,985
Okay.

397
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:14,626
But,

398
00:19:15,185 --> 00:19:15,945
Youyue,

399
00:19:16,185 --> 00:19:17,306
are we really going out?

400
00:19:17,386 --> 00:19:19,106
What? Aren't you willing to?

401
00:19:19,185 --> 00:19:20,066
Then I'll go by myself.

402
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:21,265
No, no.

403
00:19:21,626 --> 00:19:23,185
I didn't say I don't want to.

404
00:19:23,346 --> 00:19:24,346
I mean

405
00:19:24,505 --> 00:19:25,745
should we tell the dean

406
00:19:25,905 --> 00:19:27,306
before we leave?

407
00:19:27,465 --> 00:19:28,465
Are you silly?

408
00:19:28,546 --> 00:19:29,586
If we tell Master,

409
00:19:29,745 --> 00:19:31,066
can we still leave?

410
00:19:31,265 --> 00:19:32,066
We'll just

411
00:19:32,185 --> 00:19:33,985
leave a letter for Master.

412
00:19:34,146 --> 00:19:35,346
By the time he sees it,

413
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,465
we'll have left.

414
00:19:36,626 --> 00:19:37,905
Fine, I'll listen to you.

415
00:19:39,306 --> 00:19:40,945
Also, Puyang Bo,

416
00:19:41,066 --> 00:19:42,505
you must promise me

417
00:19:42,665 --> 00:19:44,185
no matter what you see

418
00:19:44,185 --> 00:19:44,945
or hear then,

419
00:19:45,146 --> 00:19:46,945
you must keep it a secret for me.

420
00:19:47,265 --> 00:19:48,106
Otherwise,

421
00:19:48,866 --> 00:19:50,185
you'll be

422
00:19:50,346 --> 00:19:51,586
single for life.

423
00:19:55,306 --> 00:19:55,945
Youyue,

424
00:19:56,106 --> 00:19:57,346
I swear to God.

425
00:19:57,425 --> 00:19:58,705
As long as

426
00:19:58,705 --> 00:19:59,465
it's about Kong Youyue,

427
00:19:59,626 --> 00:20:00,066
I will never

428
00:20:00,225 --> 00:20:01,665
leak even a single word,

429
00:20:01,905 --> 00:20:03,505
or else I'll never
have a wife in my life.

430
00:20:05,465 --> 00:20:06,465
Is that enough?

431
00:20:06,546 --> 00:20:07,146
Almost.

432
00:20:10,386 --> 00:20:11,106
Master,

433
00:20:11,306 --> 00:20:12,425
I made chicken soup for you.

434
00:20:12,465 --> 00:20:13,465
Eat it while it's hot.

435
00:20:15,386 --> 00:20:16,505
You rascal,

436
00:20:16,626 --> 00:20:17,306
don't think

437
00:20:17,306 --> 00:20:18,185
just chicken soup

438
00:20:18,185 --> 00:20:19,346
can make me forgive you.

439
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,185
You ruined the flowers

440
00:20:22,346 --> 00:20:23,905
I'd been raising for so many years.

441
00:20:24,026 --> 00:20:24,745
I'm telling you.

442
00:20:24,745 --> 00:20:25,546
If this chicken soup

443
00:20:25,546 --> 00:20:26,306
doesn't taste good,

444
00:20:26,306 --> 00:20:27,905
I'll punish you
to make it for me every day.

445
00:20:27,905 --> 00:20:29,705
Master, please don't be angry.

446
00:20:29,826 --> 00:20:30,665
I'm sure

447
00:20:30,826 --> 00:20:32,626
you'll like this soup.

448
00:20:33,225 --> 00:20:35,265
I've been raising them for so long.

449
00:20:35,905 --> 00:20:37,386
But what did you do to them?

450
00:20:38,866 --> 00:20:40,745
Master, I won't do it again.

451
00:20:41,705 --> 00:20:42,665
Here you are, Master.

452
00:20:43,026 --> 00:20:43,905
Give it a try.

453
00:20:55,786 --> 00:20:57,106
It tastes pretty good.

454
00:20:57,665 --> 00:20:59,185
Of course, Master,

455
00:20:59,185 --> 00:20:59,586
today,

456
00:20:59,586 --> 00:21:01,026
I spent the whole afternoon making it.

457
00:21:02,826 --> 00:21:04,146
Master, eat slowly.

458
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:05,546
I'll go get some more dishes.

459
00:21:10,306 --> 00:21:10,945
Rong.

460
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:19,425
Where did you get this?

461
00:21:19,505 --> 00:21:19,985
This is from the chicken

462
00:21:19,985 --> 00:21:21,146
I bought.

463
00:21:21,265 --> 00:21:22,346
I snuck this off the chicken.

464
00:21:22,505 --> 00:21:23,066
Here you are.

465
00:21:27,425 --> 00:21:28,146
Qingshi,

466
00:21:29,185 --> 00:21:30,866
come here right now!

467
00:21:31,905 --> 00:21:32,665
I'm coming.

468
00:21:33,465 --> 00:21:34,705
What's wrong, Master?

469
00:21:35,225 --> 00:21:36,546
I've made a major discovery.

470
00:21:36,705 --> 00:21:38,626
Why doesn't this chicken have legs?

471
00:21:39,386 --> 00:21:40,386
Yeah,

472
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:41,945
this chicken just doesn't have legs.

473
00:21:42,465 --> 00:21:44,265
How could there be such a thing
as a legless chicken?

474
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:45,665
You don't know.

475
00:21:45,786 --> 00:21:47,026
When I bought this chicken today,

476
00:21:47,185 --> 00:21:48,945
the vendor specifically mentioned

477
00:21:49,066 --> 00:21:50,786
a legless chicken

478
00:21:50,786 --> 00:21:52,146
tastes the most delicious.

479
00:21:52,306 --> 00:21:52,866
Really?

480
00:21:52,866 --> 00:21:54,465
And this kind of legless chicken

481
00:21:54,465 --> 00:21:55,546
can fly with its wings.

482
00:21:55,705 --> 00:21:56,386
Flying?

483
00:21:56,425 --> 00:21:56,985
Yeah.

484
00:21:56,985 --> 00:21:58,505
So it's super delicious, right?

485
00:21:58,505 --> 00:21:59,546
Yeah.

486
00:21:59,665 --> 00:22:01,146
You really think
I'm a three-year-old kid?

487
00:22:01,745 --> 00:22:02,465
Rong,

488
00:22:03,546 --> 00:22:04,905
what are you holding?

489
00:22:07,306 --> 00:22:08,146
Show it.

490
00:22:10,306 --> 00:22:11,185
Show it.

491
00:22:15,745 --> 00:22:16,745
What is this?

492
00:22:17,346 --> 00:22:18,626
You little rascal.

493
00:22:18,626 --> 00:22:19,586
You're heartless.

494
00:22:19,586 --> 00:22:20,826
You kept the chicken leg for her,

495
00:22:20,826 --> 00:22:21,866
but not for your master.

496
00:22:21,945 --> 00:22:24,185
Master, you don't know.

497
00:22:24,346 --> 00:22:25,826
It's a thank-you to her

498
00:22:25,826 --> 00:22:27,505
for teaching me the secret
of Lightning Techniques.

499
00:22:27,626 --> 00:22:29,306
That's why I...

500
00:22:29,346 --> 00:22:30,225
That's why you

501
00:22:30,225 --> 00:22:31,386
took both legs off, right?

502
00:22:31,465 --> 00:22:32,306
You little rascal.

503
00:22:32,306 --> 00:22:33,146
You're heartless.

504
00:22:33,146 --> 00:22:33,866
Your Lightning Techniques

505
00:22:33,866 --> 00:22:34,985
were taught by me.

506
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,066
I-I-I was wrong, Master.

507
00:22:36,106 --> 00:22:36,786
I was wrong.

508
00:22:36,786 --> 00:22:37,626
Two legs.

509
00:22:37,665 --> 00:22:38,106
You should at least

510
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,265
leave one for me.

511
00:22:39,306 --> 00:22:41,346
What were you thinking?

512
00:22:41,586 --> 00:22:43,386
I've been teaching
you spells for so long.

513
00:22:45,306 --> 00:22:46,665
You're so ungrateful.

514
00:22:49,146 --> 00:22:50,465
Qingshi.

515
00:23:05,103 --> 00:23:05,560
(Deity Meaning of Fire)

516
00:23:56,665 --> 00:23:57,465
Jingqiu?

517
00:23:57,866 --> 00:23:58,826
Why are you here?

518
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:00,146
Why are you here?

519
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:01,826
What are you doing back here?

520
00:24:02,026 --> 00:24:03,225
I asked the senior to let you leave

521
00:24:03,225 --> 00:24:04,505
just as a temporary solution.

522
00:24:04,665 --> 00:24:05,745
I stayed behind to slowly find a chance

523
00:24:05,745 --> 00:24:06,945
to escape.

524
00:24:07,106 --> 00:24:08,465
You still have to save your mother.

525
00:24:08,586 --> 00:24:09,026
How could you

526
00:24:09,026 --> 00:24:10,225
recklessly come back like this?

527
00:24:13,106 --> 00:24:13,786
It's rare for you

528
00:24:13,786 --> 00:24:14,985
to talk so much with me.

529
00:24:15,066 --> 00:24:16,306
You can still laugh.

530
00:24:16,465 --> 00:24:17,705
I made a deal with the senior.

531
00:24:17,705 --> 00:24:18,626
One would leave. One would stay.

532
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:19,586
Now, look,

533
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:20,786
both of us are stuck here.

534
00:24:20,786 --> 00:24:21,586
What a loss.

535
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:22,306
No loss.

536
00:24:23,066 --> 00:24:24,346
Luckily we met.

537
00:24:24,465 --> 00:24:25,665
Otherwise, we wouldn't have known
we were being duped.

538
00:24:25,905 --> 00:24:26,665
I had previously made

539
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:27,945
a deal with the senior too.

540
00:24:28,146 --> 00:24:29,106
You would leave. I would stay.

541
00:24:29,465 --> 00:24:30,185
So...

542
00:24:31,786 --> 00:24:32,626
What?

543
00:24:32,866 --> 00:24:33,546
I can't believe

544
00:24:33,626 --> 00:24:34,945
we trusted him so much back then.

545
00:24:36,626 --> 00:24:38,026
So needless to say anymore,

546
00:24:38,225 --> 00:24:39,306
you both know it already.

547
00:24:40,985 --> 00:24:41,505
Unexpectedly,

548
00:24:41,505 --> 00:24:42,905
you're so untrustworthy.

549
00:24:43,106 --> 00:24:44,265
Since that's the case,

550
00:24:44,425 --> 00:24:45,866
from today on,

551
00:24:46,346 --> 00:24:47,905
you will stay by my side,

552
00:24:47,905 --> 00:24:49,146
at my disposal.

553
00:24:49,346 --> 00:24:50,826
I'll you guidance.

554
00:24:51,066 --> 00:24:52,265
This opportunity

555
00:24:52,346 --> 00:24:54,866
is something many people can't get.

556
00:24:56,185 --> 00:24:57,185
I appreciate the consideration.

557
00:24:57,346 --> 00:24:59,465
But our abilities are insufficient.

558
00:24:59,626 --> 00:25:00,546
We can't handle it.

559
00:25:00,705 --> 00:25:02,386
Please let us leave.

560
00:25:02,546 --> 00:25:03,826
You don't appreciate it.

561
00:25:03,905 --> 00:25:04,985
My palace

562
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:06,546
is not a place for you
to come and go as you please.

563
00:25:07,146 --> 00:25:07,866
Kill!

564
00:25:14,106 --> 00:25:15,106
Jingqiu, run!

565
00:25:31,626 --> 00:25:32,185
Run!

566
00:25:37,826 --> 00:25:38,626
Split up and chase them!

567
00:25:38,745 --> 00:25:39,505
- Yes.
- Yes.

568
00:25:52,146 --> 00:25:52,705
Go!

569
00:25:54,985 --> 00:25:56,225
Master, nothing found.

570
00:25:56,386 --> 00:25:57,546
Master, nothing found.

571
00:26:22,905 --> 00:26:24,066
You two stay here.

572
00:26:24,225 --> 00:26:25,265
The others continue searching.

573
00:26:25,265 --> 00:26:25,866
- Yes.
- Yes.

574
00:26:29,225 --> 00:26:30,225
For the time being,

575
00:26:30,386 --> 00:26:31,425
they won't be able to get in.

576
00:26:31,985 --> 00:26:32,745
Xueying,

577
00:26:33,185 --> 00:26:33,985
who could

578
00:26:33,985 --> 00:26:35,146
the masked man be?

579
00:26:35,586 --> 00:26:37,265
He always wears a mask.

580
00:26:37,505 --> 00:26:38,265
Is he afraid

581
00:26:38,265 --> 00:26:39,185
that we'll recognize him?

582
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:40,826
This person is not simple.

583
00:26:41,905 --> 00:26:43,106
There are so many secrets

584
00:26:43,265 --> 00:26:44,905
in this Black Wind God Palace.

585
00:26:45,066 --> 00:26:46,225
We need to investigate it thoroughly.

586
00:26:46,386 --> 00:26:47,626
No, it's too dangerous.

587
00:26:47,745 --> 00:26:48,146
Right now,

588
00:26:48,146 --> 00:26:49,185
we need to leave here

589
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:50,546
and return to Changfeng Academy
as soon as possible.

590
00:26:50,705 --> 00:26:51,546
We need to tell
the master and the elders

591
00:26:51,546 --> 00:26:52,626
about everything here.

592
00:26:52,626 --> 00:26:53,866
They will definitely have a solution.

593
00:26:55,626 --> 00:26:56,225
Let's first see

594
00:26:56,225 --> 00:26:57,185
if there's another exit.

595
00:27:18,745 --> 00:27:19,465
Jingqiu.

596
00:27:23,066 --> 00:27:23,786
What is this?

597
00:27:27,225 --> 00:27:28,386
This is Dark Ice.

598
00:27:28,626 --> 00:27:29,546
Among ice-related magical tools,

599
00:27:29,546 --> 00:27:30,745
it's a rare treasure.

600
00:27:31,066 --> 00:27:31,985
Such a good thing.

601
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:32,866
We should keep it well.

602
00:27:35,546 --> 00:27:36,826
It seems

603
00:27:38,905 --> 00:27:40,465
this is a secret chamber
for cultivation.

604
00:27:41,066 --> 00:27:41,945
And its owner

605
00:27:43,066 --> 00:27:44,705
apparently didn't succeed
in cultivation.

606
00:27:47,705 --> 00:27:48,705
This person's level

607
00:27:48,705 --> 00:27:49,665
mustn't be low.

608
00:27:50,225 --> 00:27:52,185
Was he cultivating here

609
00:27:52,306 --> 00:27:53,705
to break through to Transcendence?

610
00:27:53,945 --> 00:27:54,826
We've been unable to find

611
00:27:54,826 --> 00:27:55,786
the way out.

612
00:27:56,106 --> 00:27:57,945
Perhaps only Transcendent lives

613
00:27:58,106 --> 00:27:59,826
can walk out of the Black Wind Cliff.

614
00:27:59,985 --> 00:28:01,586
Do we have to become Transcendent

615
00:28:01,826 --> 00:28:02,945
to get out?

616
00:28:07,306 --> 00:28:07,985
Xueying,

617
00:28:08,665 --> 00:28:09,626
are you okay?

618
00:29:01,985 --> 00:29:02,826
How is it?

619
00:29:02,985 --> 00:29:03,786
Feeling better?

620
00:29:03,905 --> 00:29:04,786
I'm much better.

621
00:29:05,705 --> 00:29:07,306
Just now, when I was
channeling my energy,

622
00:29:07,586 --> 00:29:09,026
I felt like my whole being

623
00:29:09,185 --> 00:29:10,586
was wrapped

624
00:29:10,586 --> 00:29:11,386
in a powerful force.

625
00:29:11,505 --> 00:29:12,945
It helped increase my Internal Energy.

626
00:29:12,985 --> 00:29:14,386
Did you feel it

627
00:29:14,546 --> 00:29:15,546
when I was healing you just now?

628
00:29:15,586 --> 00:29:16,425
I felt it.

629
00:29:17,386 --> 00:29:18,465
This must be the effect

630
00:29:18,465 --> 00:29:19,386
of the Dark Ice we just discovered.

631
00:29:20,665 --> 00:29:22,066
I just felt

632
00:29:22,225 --> 00:29:24,026
a particularly powerful force.

633
00:29:24,185 --> 00:29:25,066
It was like...

634
00:29:25,146 --> 00:29:27,626
Like a volcano meeting a tsunami.

635
00:29:27,786 --> 00:29:28,505
That's right.

636
00:29:28,826 --> 00:29:29,505
And I feel like

637
00:29:29,505 --> 00:29:30,826
I've realized something.

638
00:29:31,866 --> 00:29:33,945
Then this must be
the effect of the Dark Ice.

639
00:29:34,505 --> 00:29:35,866
Does this count as

640
00:29:35,905 --> 00:29:36,985
a blessing in disguise for us?

641
00:29:39,866 --> 00:29:40,465
Jingqiu,

642
00:29:41,826 --> 00:29:42,546
thank you.

643
00:29:44,026 --> 00:29:45,265
If it hadn't been for you just now,

644
00:29:45,386 --> 00:29:45,945
I would have already...

645
00:29:45,985 --> 00:29:46,786
Xueying,

646
00:29:46,866 --> 00:29:48,265
you need to give yourself more time.

647
00:29:48,265 --> 00:29:49,346
Don't be too impatient.

648
00:29:50,705 --> 00:29:52,185
When it started snowing earlier,

649
00:29:53,225 --> 00:29:54,665
I thought of the Xueying Territory.

650
00:29:54,905 --> 00:29:56,185
I thought of Qingshi,

651
00:29:56,866 --> 00:29:58,346
Uncle Zong and Uncle Tong San.

652
00:29:58,945 --> 00:30:00,066
Dinner's ready!

653
00:30:00,066 --> 00:30:01,146
- Kids.
- It smells so good.

654
00:30:01,945 --> 00:30:02,626
It smells so good.

655
00:30:02,626 --> 00:30:03,546
Dinner time.

656
00:30:04,586 --> 00:30:05,225
Come on.

657
00:30:06,026 --> 00:30:06,826
Sit down.

658
00:30:07,306 --> 00:30:09,225
It looks so appetizing.

659
00:30:09,306 --> 00:30:10,185
Wash your hands.

660
00:30:11,826 --> 00:30:13,505
Come on, Ying.

661
00:30:18,146 --> 00:30:19,346
Ying, Shi,

662
00:30:19,505 --> 00:30:20,465
eat a lot.

663
00:30:22,586 --> 00:30:23,265
I wonder

664
00:30:23,265 --> 00:30:24,265
how they are doing now.

665
00:30:38,146 --> 00:30:39,026
From now on,

666
00:30:39,225 --> 00:30:40,626
let me make snow for you.

667
00:30:41,425 --> 00:30:43,225
But the Dark Ice is so precious.

668
00:30:43,306 --> 00:30:44,586
Isn't it a loss if you use it like this?

669
00:30:45,586 --> 00:30:46,705
You cook fish for me,

670
00:30:46,705 --> 00:30:47,826
and I make snow for you.

671
00:30:47,985 --> 00:30:49,225
That's fair, right?

672
00:31:34,905 --> 00:31:35,665
Rong,

673
00:31:35,945 --> 00:31:37,386
I couldn't snatch it from Master.

674
00:31:37,546 --> 00:31:38,425
But next time,

675
00:31:38,546 --> 00:31:39,786
I'll cook chicken legs for you.

676
00:31:39,985 --> 00:31:40,905
It's alright.

677
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:42,945
It's okay not to have
chicken legs to eat.

678
00:31:44,265 --> 00:31:45,586
Master is like this.

679
00:31:45,786 --> 00:31:47,106
An old rascal.

680
00:31:47,386 --> 00:31:48,705
He's getting more and more mischievous.

681
00:31:50,786 --> 00:31:52,106
There's no way to deal with him.

682
00:31:52,826 --> 00:31:54,505
Sometimes, it's quite fun.

683
00:31:55,306 --> 00:31:56,146
Yes,

684
00:31:57,146 --> 00:31:58,146
it's quite fun.

685
00:32:00,265 --> 00:32:01,465
It reminds me

686
00:32:01,626 --> 00:32:03,505
of when my brother and I
fought over snacks as kids.

687
00:32:04,465 --> 00:32:06,626
Brother, wait for me!

688
00:32:07,665 --> 00:32:10,505
Brother, let me have a bite.

689
00:32:13,026 --> 00:32:15,185
Just one bite.

690
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,146
My mother died

691
00:32:28,146 --> 00:32:28,945
when I was five,

692
00:32:30,786 --> 00:32:32,146
and my father didn't want me.

693
00:32:32,705 --> 00:32:34,265
Everyone bullied me

694
00:32:35,945 --> 00:32:37,546
because I couldn't fight back.

695
00:32:38,745 --> 00:32:40,386
Cold and hungry,

696
00:32:41,905 --> 00:32:43,146
lonely and miserable.

697
00:32:43,826 --> 00:32:44,705
I was so sick several times

698
00:32:44,786 --> 00:32:45,945
that I couldn't get up.

699
00:32:47,066 --> 00:32:49,146
I thought I wouldn't live to grow up.

700
00:32:52,505 --> 00:32:53,225
Rong,

701
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:54,905
I never expected

702
00:32:55,626 --> 00:32:56,465
that you had

703
00:32:56,465 --> 00:32:57,346
such a miserable past.

704
00:32:58,026 --> 00:32:58,985
Yes,

705
00:33:00,346 --> 00:33:02,225
but I've made it through now.

706
00:33:03,146 --> 00:33:05,185
We can't predict

707
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:06,626
what will happen in life.

708
00:33:07,146 --> 00:33:08,546
All we can do

709
00:33:09,505 --> 00:33:12,225
is work hard and persevere.

710
00:33:12,465 --> 00:33:13,626
Then there's hope.

711
00:33:15,905 --> 00:33:17,185
I can do it,

712
00:33:17,546 --> 00:33:18,705
and so can you.

713
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:20,146
Yes,

714
00:33:21,386 --> 00:33:22,386
I can do it too.

715
00:33:22,786 --> 00:33:23,786
I've said it before.

716
00:33:25,066 --> 00:33:26,465
I will always be

717
00:33:27,465 --> 00:33:29,425
with you.

718
00:33:48,386 --> 00:33:49,146
Have you heard?

719
00:33:49,306 --> 00:33:50,786
The Sea God Palace was destroyed.

720
00:33:51,026 --> 00:33:52,505
The news is already widespread.

721
00:33:52,586 --> 00:33:53,386
It's not fresh anymore.

722
00:33:53,546 --> 00:33:54,826
Then tell me something fresh.

723
00:33:54,985 --> 00:33:56,146
Do you know why we

724
00:33:56,146 --> 00:33:57,586
lost so badly this time?

725
00:33:58,346 --> 00:33:59,386
The Transcendent beings
of the Sea God Palace

726
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:00,626
were defeated by the Demon Clan

727
00:34:00,626 --> 00:34:01,386
because

728
00:34:01,425 --> 00:34:02,985
someone sold Bloodshed Weapons to them.

729
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:04,546
What? Isn't that an accomplice?

730
00:34:04,866 --> 00:34:05,786
Keep it down!

731
00:34:05,905 --> 00:34:06,985
Who is so shameless?

732
00:34:06,985 --> 00:34:07,586
Youyue.

733
00:34:07,705 --> 00:34:09,506
This is this month's account book.

734
00:34:09,586 --> 00:34:11,185
Please check it.

735
00:34:11,345 --> 00:34:12,185
Put it here.

736
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,506
The most important one is the other one.

737
00:34:22,345 --> 00:34:23,185
Miss.

738
00:34:23,185 --> 00:34:23,665
Father.

739
00:34:23,665 --> 00:34:24,385
Yue,

740
00:34:25,426 --> 00:34:27,906
why did you suddenly
decide to come back?

741
00:34:28,146 --> 00:34:30,066
Father, don't you want me to come back

742
00:34:30,265 --> 00:34:31,745
or are you hiding something from me?

743
00:34:33,466 --> 00:34:35,345
How come I hide anything from you?

744
00:34:35,546 --> 00:34:36,745
As a young lady,

745
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:37,906
you barged into my study

746
00:34:37,906 --> 00:34:39,946
without a word.

747
00:34:40,066 --> 00:34:42,026
Isn't that improper?

748
00:34:42,185 --> 00:34:43,745
Father, you've changed.

749
00:34:44,146 --> 00:34:45,865
I used to come and go as I pleased,

750
00:34:45,865 --> 00:34:47,385
and you never said anything.

751
00:34:50,705 --> 00:34:51,546
Master,

752
00:34:51,986 --> 00:34:54,146
you can talk to the young lady first.

753
00:34:54,345 --> 00:34:56,745
I'll take my leave now.

754
00:35:01,426 --> 00:35:02,745
W-W-Who...?

755
00:35:02,745 --> 00:35:03,745
Who is that?

756
00:35:04,665 --> 00:35:05,345
Master.

757
00:35:05,345 --> 00:35:06,185
Mr. Jia,

758
00:35:06,626 --> 00:35:07,825
please let him in.

759
00:35:08,146 --> 00:35:10,225
Yes. Please come in.

760
00:35:13,225 --> 00:35:15,506
I, Puyang Bo, pay my respects.

761
00:35:15,506 --> 00:35:16,185
Enough.

762
00:35:16,385 --> 00:35:17,586
I don't care who you are.

763
00:35:17,825 --> 00:35:18,986
Our mansion

764
00:35:19,305 --> 00:35:20,705
is not a marketplace.

765
00:35:20,946 --> 00:35:21,665
Father,

766
00:35:21,865 --> 00:35:23,626
he is my classmate,

767
00:35:23,745 --> 00:35:25,146
and he escorted me back here.

768
00:35:25,225 --> 00:35:26,665
Instead of thanking him,

769
00:35:26,705 --> 00:35:27,865
you want to drive him away.

770
00:35:28,106 --> 00:35:29,066
How can I face going back

771
00:35:29,066 --> 00:35:30,106
to Changfeng Academy?

772
00:35:30,265 --> 00:35:31,066
Why would the academy

773
00:35:31,066 --> 00:35:32,546
send you back?

774
00:35:33,225 --> 00:35:34,745
Did you cause trouble again?

775
00:35:36,185 --> 00:35:37,066
Father,

776
00:35:37,225 --> 00:35:38,385
I didn't cause any trouble.

777
00:35:38,865 --> 00:35:40,185
Everyone at the academy

778
00:35:40,185 --> 00:35:41,825
has gone to catch demons.

779
00:35:42,506 --> 00:35:43,986
There's no one left to teach.

780
00:35:44,665 --> 00:35:46,066
All the people from Changfeng Academy

781
00:35:46,066 --> 00:35:47,066
have been dispatched?

782
00:35:47,265 --> 00:35:48,345
Is it that serious?

783
00:35:48,745 --> 00:35:49,586
Of course,

784
00:35:49,705 --> 00:35:51,865
this time the Demon Clan
attacked the Sea God Palace,

785
00:35:52,426 --> 00:35:54,506
and Master Tai Shu is furious.

786
00:35:54,626 --> 00:35:55,546
Not only did he order

787
00:35:55,626 --> 00:35:57,146
the nationwide capture of demons,

788
00:35:57,185 --> 00:35:58,106
but he also ordered

789
00:35:58,185 --> 00:35:59,225
any discovered collaborators

790
00:35:59,225 --> 00:36:00,385
with the demons

791
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:02,385
must be arrested,

792
00:36:02,385 --> 00:36:03,385
and no one will be spared.

793
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:08,745
Father!

794
00:36:10,345 --> 00:36:11,865
Father, what are you thinking about?

795
00:36:14,265 --> 00:36:15,185
Nothing.

796
00:36:16,705 --> 00:36:18,426
It's quite good that you came back.

797
00:36:18,705 --> 00:36:19,705
As for Changfeng Academy,

798
00:36:19,705 --> 00:36:21,026
you don't need to go back there.

799
00:36:22,106 --> 00:36:23,506
Hurry up and find
a suitable family to marry into.

800
00:36:23,586 --> 00:36:24,986
As for your future husband...

801
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:28,466
Not him, anyway.

802
00:36:29,185 --> 00:36:30,946
Tomorrow, I'll find

803
00:36:30,946 --> 00:36:31,906
some well-matched families for you,

804
00:36:31,906 --> 00:36:33,385
so you can choose carefully.

805
00:36:34,185 --> 00:36:35,986
There you go again.

806
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,066
Last time, you lied to me,

807
00:36:37,066 --> 00:36:38,146
saying I had a childhood betrothal.

808
00:36:39,305 --> 00:36:40,305
Yue,

809
00:36:40,385 --> 00:36:42,185
that childhood engagement doesn't count.

810
00:36:42,265 --> 00:36:43,265
Back then,

811
00:36:43,345 --> 00:36:44,185
I thought

812
00:36:44,185 --> 00:36:46,345
that Xueying had some ability,

813
00:36:46,426 --> 00:36:48,185
and I wanted you to be a lord's wife,

814
00:36:48,426 --> 00:36:49,466
so you wouldn't be bullied.

815
00:36:49,705 --> 00:36:50,265
Moreover,

816
00:36:50,265 --> 00:36:52,026
it would benefit our family's business.

817
00:36:52,185 --> 00:36:53,785
But now he's dead,

818
00:36:53,785 --> 00:36:54,665
so of course...

819
00:36:54,946 --> 00:36:55,825
Of course, you have to find

820
00:36:55,825 --> 00:36:57,265
someone else with power, influence,

821
00:36:57,305 --> 00:36:59,185
money, and a bit foolish

822
00:36:59,225 --> 00:37:00,066
to sell me off,

823
00:37:00,106 --> 00:37:00,586
right?

824
00:37:00,586 --> 00:37:01,305
Nonsense.

825
00:37:01,546 --> 00:37:03,146
That's not what I meant.

826
00:37:03,946 --> 00:37:05,106
No wonder Xueying

827
00:37:05,106 --> 00:37:06,345
never liked me.

828
00:37:07,066 --> 00:37:08,906
When his parents had an accident,

829
00:37:09,146 --> 00:37:10,986
and the Xueying Territory
was in difficult times,

830
00:37:11,785 --> 00:37:12,865
did you act like this too,

831
00:37:12,865 --> 00:37:13,626
forgetting loyalty for personal gain

832
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,665
and kicking them while they were down?

833
00:37:14,665 --> 00:37:15,225
You!

834
00:37:23,106 --> 00:37:24,986
Yue!

835
00:37:30,026 --> 00:37:30,705
Youyue,

836
00:37:31,466 --> 00:37:33,185
Youyue, don't be sad.

837
00:37:33,185 --> 00:37:33,865
Your father,

838
00:37:33,865 --> 00:37:35,106
actually, just cares about you.

839
00:37:35,185 --> 00:37:36,066
But his reaction to you talking back

840
00:37:36,066 --> 00:37:37,185
was indeed a bit...

841
00:37:38,426 --> 00:37:39,146
No.

842
00:37:39,385 --> 00:37:40,865
My father must be hiding
something from me.

843
00:37:41,865 --> 00:37:43,626
He wants me to leave here,

844
00:37:43,705 --> 00:37:45,026
so I won't know.

845
00:37:45,345 --> 00:37:47,546
I won't leave. I must find out.

846
00:37:47,825 --> 00:37:48,426
Go back.

847
00:37:48,586 --> 00:37:49,106
What?

848
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:51,066
Youyue, you're going back again?

849
00:38:03,066 --> 00:38:04,106
What are you doing?

850
00:38:08,546 --> 00:38:10,466
Youyue,

851
00:38:11,066 --> 00:38:11,825
hurry up.

852
00:38:11,825 --> 00:38:12,745
What are you looking for?

853
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:13,865
Shut up.

854
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:17,785
Where are you going?

855
00:38:17,906 --> 00:38:18,586
Stop messing around,

856
00:38:18,586 --> 00:38:19,225
Go!

857
00:38:19,265 --> 00:38:20,745
Let's talk inside.

858
00:38:21,066 --> 00:38:22,506
You must pay me my wages today.

859
00:38:22,506 --> 00:38:23,385
Let's talk it over inside.

860
00:38:23,385 --> 00:38:24,546
Hurry up and give me my wages.

861
00:38:24,546 --> 00:38:26,026
Mr. Zuo, please calm down.

862
00:38:26,026 --> 00:38:27,665
Let's talk things out.

863
00:38:27,665 --> 00:38:29,265
I have nothing to talk about with you.

864
00:38:29,345 --> 00:38:29,986
My mother is waiting

865
00:38:29,986 --> 00:38:31,586
for this money to save her life.

866
00:38:31,665 --> 00:38:33,225
Today, you either give me the money,

867
00:38:33,265 --> 00:38:34,745
or we both die together.

868
00:38:34,745 --> 00:38:35,185
Yes.

869
00:38:35,185 --> 00:38:35,946
Will you give it or not?

870
00:38:36,066 --> 00:38:37,705
Of course, I will.

871
00:38:37,946 --> 00:38:39,066
But, Mr. Zuo,

872
00:38:39,265 --> 00:38:40,026
you know

873
00:38:40,185 --> 00:38:42,506
I don't have that much cash right now.

874
00:38:42,546 --> 00:38:43,066
So...

875
00:38:43,066 --> 00:38:43,946
Nonsense!

876
00:38:44,466 --> 00:38:46,265
You just sold Bloodshed Weapons

877
00:38:46,586 --> 00:38:47,986
but you told me you didn't have cash?

878
00:38:47,986 --> 00:38:48,986
Bloodshed Weapons.

879
00:38:48,986 --> 00:38:50,665
I saw Mr. Kong

880
00:38:50,665 --> 00:38:52,066
and a man in black trading them,

881
00:38:52,506 --> 00:38:54,305
and you got a big roll
of gold certificate notes.

882
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:55,865
Those workers don't know

883
00:38:55,865 --> 00:38:57,265
what a Bloodshed Weapon is,

884
00:38:57,466 --> 00:38:58,946
but I've seen that treasure

885
00:38:58,946 --> 00:39:00,265
in a military book.

886
00:39:00,865 --> 00:39:02,825
Mr. Zuo, now,

887
00:39:03,626 --> 00:39:05,426
I'll give you the money now.

888
00:39:05,506 --> 00:39:06,066
How about this?

889
00:39:06,265 --> 00:39:08,906
Let's go to the back door
and I'll give you the money there.

890
00:39:08,906 --> 00:39:09,546
Let's go.

891
00:39:09,586 --> 00:39:10,225
Please.

892
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:17,026
Be careful, Mr. Zuo.

893
00:39:24,106 --> 00:39:25,066
Drag him away right now.

894
00:39:29,506 --> 00:39:30,426
Mr. Jia.

895
00:39:31,946 --> 00:39:32,825
Sorry

896
00:39:33,946 --> 00:39:35,026
in advance.

897
00:39:35,265 --> 00:39:35,865
Someone, come here.

898
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:36,506
- Yes.
- Yes.

899
00:40:01,705 --> 00:40:02,745
Still eating?

900
00:40:03,066 --> 00:40:04,066
Hurry up.

901
00:40:15,385 --> 00:40:16,745
From now on,

902
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:18,745
you are not allowed
to leave your room for a single step.

903
00:40:19,946 --> 00:40:21,626
Who did you sell
the Bloodshed Weapons to?

904
00:40:22,066 --> 00:40:23,785
Don't ask what you shouldn't know.

905
00:40:24,265 --> 00:40:25,506
I'm doing this for your own good.

906
00:40:27,946 --> 00:40:30,146
Who exactly did you sell
the Bloodshed Weapons to?

907
00:40:32,865 --> 00:40:34,506
If anyone asks about this man,

908
00:40:35,066 --> 00:40:36,745
just say he went back to his hometown.

909
00:40:36,906 --> 00:40:37,466
Yes.

910
00:40:37,865 --> 00:40:39,106
What are you going to do with him?

911
00:40:39,665 --> 00:40:41,466
It's just his bad luck.

912
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:42,705
Father, are you insane?

913
00:40:42,785 --> 00:40:43,946
He's my friend.

914
00:40:44,026 --> 00:40:44,785
You can't hurt him.

915
00:40:44,785 --> 00:40:45,466
Enough.

916
00:40:45,946 --> 00:40:47,026
If not for you,

917
00:40:47,066 --> 00:40:48,265
could he be here?

918
00:40:48,825 --> 00:40:49,466
Someone, come here.

919
00:40:49,466 --> 00:40:49,946
- Yes.
- Yes.

920
00:40:49,946 --> 00:40:50,546
Take him away.

921
00:40:50,546 --> 00:40:51,146
- Yes.
- Yes.

922
00:40:51,385 --> 00:40:52,745
Who dares?

923
00:40:54,225 --> 00:40:55,146
Yue,

924
00:40:55,546 --> 00:40:57,225
what on earth do you want to do?

925
00:40:57,225 --> 00:40:58,265
I want you to let him go.

926
00:40:58,946 --> 00:40:59,705
Youyue,

927
00:41:00,546 --> 00:41:01,665
don't push me.

928
00:41:03,785 --> 00:41:04,305
Father,

929
00:41:05,546 --> 00:41:06,546
stop it.

930
00:41:07,185 --> 00:41:08,745
I won't let anyone

931
00:41:09,026 --> 00:41:10,345
ruin our family.

932
00:41:10,626 --> 00:41:11,426
Do it.

933
00:41:12,106 --> 00:41:12,906
Puyang Bo.

934
00:41:19,986 --> 00:41:21,146
Luckily I know the Shadow Steps,

935
00:41:21,185 --> 00:41:22,626
or your father would have caught me.

936
00:41:22,825 --> 00:41:23,825
What should I do?

937
00:41:23,946 --> 00:41:25,946
My father has killed so many people.

938
00:41:26,106 --> 00:41:27,705
If they come after us,

939
00:41:27,865 --> 00:41:28,506
my brother and I...

940
00:41:28,586 --> 00:41:29,546
Alright, Youyue.

941
00:41:29,546 --> 00:41:30,745
Calm down first.

942
00:41:30,946 --> 00:41:32,146
We will find a solution.

943
00:41:33,785 --> 00:41:34,305
So,

944
00:41:34,546 --> 00:41:35,586
as long as we can find out

945
00:41:35,586 --> 00:41:37,185
who the Bloodshed Weapons were sold to,

946
00:41:37,225 --> 00:41:38,586
we should be able to trace the source

947
00:41:38,626 --> 00:41:39,225
and find

948
00:41:39,225 --> 00:41:40,506
those lurking demon spies.

949
00:41:41,225 --> 00:41:42,265
Then we can help your father

950
00:41:42,265 --> 00:41:43,506
atone for his sins, right?

951
00:41:44,265 --> 00:41:45,345
Atoning for sins.

952
00:41:47,626 --> 00:41:49,225
Yes, atoning for sins.

953
00:41:57,426 --> 00:41:58,225
Who's that?

954
00:41:58,345 --> 00:42:01,946
Don't play tricks on me.
