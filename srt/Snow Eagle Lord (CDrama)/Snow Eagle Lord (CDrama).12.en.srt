(Xueying Territory)

22
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:56,530
Thank you.

23
00:01:58,050 --> 00:01:59,849
Qingshi, you're up.

24
00:02:00,369 --> 00:02:01,330
I cooked you some porridge.

25
00:02:01,369 --> 00:02:02,250
Come and have a taste.

26
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:09,410
Thank you, Rong.

27
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:24,049
It tastes really good.

28
00:02:25,289 --> 00:02:27,210
You seem to be in good spirits today.

29
00:02:27,530 --> 00:02:29,169
I just spoke with Uncle Tong San

30
00:02:29,169 --> 00:02:30,289
and Uncle Zong Ling.

31
00:02:30,609 --> 00:02:31,569
I think you should stay
in Xueying Territory

32
00:02:31,569 --> 00:02:32,370
for a few more days.

33
00:02:33,169 --> 00:02:34,729
I'll go back to my Master first.

34
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:37,810
Your brother has died.

35
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,930
Xueying Territory needs your help.

36
00:02:40,490 --> 00:02:41,729
Yes, Shi.

37
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:43,970
Stay in the fort for a few more days

38
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:44,970
and get some good rest.

39
00:02:45,329 --> 00:02:45,930
No, thank you.

40
00:02:46,329 --> 00:02:47,849
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong San,

41
00:02:48,769 --> 00:02:50,650
I plan to go back with Ji Rong.

42
00:02:51,250 --> 00:02:52,289
Now

43
00:02:53,009 --> 00:02:54,009
my brother has died.

44
00:02:55,169 --> 00:02:56,690
I must grow stronger

45
00:02:57,289 --> 00:02:58,169
as fast as possible,

46
00:02:59,449 --> 00:03:01,049
so I can save my mother,

47
00:03:01,930 --> 00:03:02,930
defeat the Demon Clan,

48
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,090
and avenge my brother.

49
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:14,410
Alright,

50
00:03:14,889 --> 00:03:15,810
let's not talk about it anymore.

51
00:03:16,049 --> 00:03:16,609
Let's eat.

52
00:03:17,049 --> 00:03:18,169
Uncle Tong San, Uncle Zong,

53
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:19,410
let me serve you some food.

54
00:03:21,329 --> 00:03:21,810
Come on.

55
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,690
Master!

56
00:03:39,690 --> 00:03:40,569
What's the matter?

57
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,210
Yu Jingqiu is missing.

58
00:03:42,449 --> 00:03:43,769
She didn't come back last night.

59
00:03:43,970 --> 00:03:44,889
We thought

60
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,889
she took a leave of absence.

61
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,049
What?

62
00:03:54,289 --> 00:03:54,970
Master.

63
00:03:55,410 --> 00:03:56,289
Why are you not sleeping
at this late hour?

64
00:03:56,729 --> 00:03:57,690
What are you doing here?

65
00:03:58,370 --> 00:03:59,609
I came to the library

66
00:03:59,729 --> 00:04:00,569
to read some books.

67
00:04:01,690 --> 00:04:02,889
Go back and rest early.

68
00:04:04,769 --> 00:04:05,650
I'll take my leave.

69
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:08,289
Who was with you last night

70
00:04:08,530 --> 00:04:09,650
in the library?

71
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:11,410
I was alone.

72
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:13,370
Jingqiu didn't return last night.

73
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:14,849
She hasn't come back yet.

74
00:04:15,530 --> 00:04:16,769
If you care for her,

75
00:04:16,769 --> 00:04:17,690
tell me quickly.

76
00:04:18,930 --> 00:04:19,969
Jingqiu...

77
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,969
Tell the truth.

78
00:04:28,089 --> 00:04:28,730
Jingqiu,

79
00:04:33,930 --> 00:04:35,130
what are you holding in your hand?

80
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,769
It's the Lotus Lamp, right?

81
00:04:40,529 --> 00:04:42,290
Jingqiu, don't do anything stupid.

82
00:04:43,649 --> 00:04:44,969
I want to go down and look for Xueying.

83
00:04:45,170 --> 00:04:46,409
Xueying is already dead.

84
00:04:46,409 --> 00:04:47,290
The deceased can't come back to life.

85
00:04:47,290 --> 00:04:48,250
Who says he's dead?

86
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:50,209
Jingqiu.

87
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:52,490
How could anyone survive falling

88
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:53,769
from the Black Wind Cliff?

89
00:04:54,130 --> 00:04:55,850
Then I must find his corpse.

90
00:04:56,009 --> 00:04:56,969
Only when I see it with my own eyes

91
00:04:57,209 --> 00:04:58,009
will I believe.

92
00:04:58,690 --> 00:04:59,649
Is it worth

93
00:05:00,569 --> 00:05:02,329
risking your life

94
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:04,130
for him?

95
00:05:05,290 --> 00:05:06,009
It's worth it.

96
00:05:10,089 --> 00:05:11,610
Jingqiu went to the library,

97
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:13,050
took the Lotus Lamp,

98
00:05:13,409 --> 00:05:14,850
and went to the Black Wind Cliff
to look for Xueying.

99
00:05:15,089 --> 00:05:15,850
Monkey business!

100
00:05:27,170 --> 00:05:28,769
You're quite extravagant

101
00:05:28,769 --> 00:05:29,769
using the Esoteric Fire to roast fish.

102
00:05:30,250 --> 00:05:31,449
There's no other way

103
00:05:31,449 --> 00:05:32,569
to make a fire here.

104
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:34,209
I didn't expect

105
00:05:35,409 --> 00:05:36,089
that we...

106
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,329
What's the matter?

107
00:05:41,690 --> 00:05:42,850
Did you catch a cold

108
00:05:42,850 --> 00:05:43,569
while fishing just now?

109
00:05:49,290 --> 00:05:50,529
Although extravagant,

110
00:05:50,529 --> 00:05:51,690
it's quite nice to look at.

111
00:05:52,170 --> 00:05:53,490
If it could change colors

112
00:05:53,490 --> 00:05:55,170
like fireworks, it would be even better.

113
00:05:57,610 --> 00:05:58,409
Then I'll

114
00:05:58,769 --> 00:05:59,610
work twice as hard

115
00:05:59,969 --> 00:06:00,649
and strive to

116
00:06:00,969 --> 00:06:02,170
create colorful fireworks for you

117
00:06:02,170 --> 00:06:03,529
as soon as possible.

118
00:06:03,529 --> 00:06:04,089
How about that?

119
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:04,930
Great.

120
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:06,850
I'll definitely come to watch.

121
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:11,329
What kind of fish is this?

122
00:06:12,769 --> 00:06:14,250
This is

123
00:06:15,930 --> 00:06:16,969
Dongbo Snowfish.

124
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,370
What kind of fish is this?

125
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:23,409
Snowfish.

126
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:24,969
Snowfish?

127
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,130
The fish I, Dongbo Xueying, roast

128
00:06:27,130 --> 00:06:28,089
is of course snowfish.

129
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:32,930
Xueying,

130
00:06:33,690 --> 00:06:35,170
this is the first time I feel

131
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:35,810
that being without family

132
00:06:35,810 --> 00:06:37,130
can also be so warm.

133
00:06:38,209 --> 00:06:39,089
There is still no news

134
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:40,290
about your family?

135
00:06:42,009 --> 00:06:43,730
Even Dragon Mountain Mansion,
which knows all the information,

136
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:45,089
can't find anything.

137
00:06:46,329 --> 00:06:47,810
But with what I have now,

138
00:06:47,930 --> 00:06:49,170
I'm already very content.

139
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:52,449
As long as you don't give up,

140
00:06:52,850 --> 00:06:54,089
there's always hope.

141
00:06:55,009 --> 00:06:56,810
Actually, I've gradually accepted it.

142
00:06:57,089 --> 00:06:58,130
Over the years,

143
00:06:58,170 --> 00:06:59,850
I've lived in Water Daoist Temple.

144
00:07:00,209 --> 00:07:01,930
Faction Leader and my seniors

145
00:07:01,930 --> 00:07:02,969
have all been very kind to me.

146
00:07:03,290 --> 00:07:04,769
Now I've met you.

147
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:05,969
Moreover,

148
00:07:06,250 --> 00:07:07,449
you fell off the Black Wind Cliff,

149
00:07:07,449 --> 00:07:08,730
but you managed to escape death.

150
00:07:08,889 --> 00:07:10,130
I can see you again.

151
00:07:10,649 --> 00:07:12,130
I feel very fortunate.

152
00:07:12,449 --> 00:07:13,810
I also feel very fortunate.

153
00:07:15,329 --> 00:07:15,969
Jingqiu,

154
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,649
we will reunite

155
00:07:18,649 --> 00:07:19,649
with our families soon.

156
00:07:26,250 --> 00:07:27,130
The fish is burnt.

157
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:28,250
Oh no! Oh no!

158
00:07:31,529 --> 00:07:32,569
All up. All up.

159
00:07:32,649 --> 00:07:33,850
My Dongbo Snowfish

160
00:07:34,569 --> 00:07:35,610
is overcooked.

161
00:07:51,364 --> 00:07:52,769
(Dongbo Xueying, Yu Jingqiu)

162
00:07:52,769 --> 00:07:54,730
Still thinking about Xueying
and Yu Jingqiu?

163
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,250
They died at the Black Wind Cliff
one after another.

164
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:01,009
It's my fault as a master

165
00:08:01,009 --> 00:08:02,089
for not protecting them well.

166
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:03,370
Many things

167
00:08:03,370 --> 00:08:04,930
are beyond our control.

168
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,050
We can't foresee them,

169
00:08:07,050 --> 00:08:08,250
nor can we change them.

170
00:08:08,690 --> 00:08:09,850
You've done your best.

171
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:11,649
Xueying and Jingqiu

172
00:08:12,130 --> 00:08:13,889
are students I value very much.

173
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,569
Jingqiu and I come from the same school.

174
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:19,290
Sikong Yang and I

175
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,409
watched her grow up.

176
00:08:20,969 --> 00:08:22,930
She's been practicing Ice Technique
since she was little.

177
00:08:23,930 --> 00:08:25,170
She was intelligent and talented.

178
00:08:25,529 --> 00:08:26,730
Given time,

179
00:08:27,529 --> 00:08:29,209
she would have made great achievements

180
00:08:29,209 --> 00:08:30,250
in Ice Technique.

181
00:08:31,649 --> 00:08:33,090
Jingqiu and Xueying

182
00:08:33,169 --> 00:08:34,490
were the two most promising disciples

183
00:08:34,490 --> 00:08:36,009
in our Changfeng Academy.

184
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:36,689
That's right.

185
00:08:37,210 --> 00:08:38,970
Xueying's martial arts foundation
was solid.

186
00:08:40,370 --> 00:08:41,490
Not only was he diligent,

187
00:08:42,610 --> 00:08:43,850
but he also had
an extremely high comprehension.

188
00:08:44,409 --> 00:08:45,529
For all techniques,

189
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:46,730
he understood them with just a hint.

190
00:08:47,730 --> 00:08:48,769
His potential

191
00:08:49,169 --> 00:08:50,330
was immense.

192
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,009
Through this period of training,

193
00:08:52,009 --> 00:08:53,009
I've also noticed

194
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,809
he can always keep mobilizing

195
00:08:54,809 --> 00:08:55,850
his Dou Qi.

196
00:08:56,649 --> 00:08:57,370
As you know,

197
00:08:57,689 --> 00:08:59,970
for a knight, Dou Qi is crucial.

198
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,370
No wonder,

199
00:09:01,769 --> 00:09:03,529
among the new disciples,

200
00:09:03,649 --> 00:09:04,769
you value him the most.

201
00:09:05,210 --> 00:09:06,490
Martial arts practice is secondary.

202
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:07,769
The most important thing is

203
00:09:08,049 --> 00:09:09,250
he can tell right from wrong,

204
00:09:09,529 --> 00:09:10,689
takes responsibility
in difficult situations,

205
00:09:11,090 --> 00:09:12,610
and is willing
to stick to his principles.

206
00:09:13,210 --> 00:09:13,889
This is

207
00:09:14,130 --> 00:09:15,649
more important than martial skills.

208
00:09:15,929 --> 00:09:16,570
That's right.

209
00:09:16,850 --> 00:09:18,009
Both Xueying and Jingqiu

210
00:09:18,009 --> 00:09:18,889
have kind,

211
00:09:18,889 --> 00:09:19,970
righteous hearts.

212
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:25,409
Now we've suddenly

213
00:09:25,889 --> 00:09:27,809
lost two outstanding disciples.

214
00:09:29,009 --> 00:09:30,250
I feel heartbroken for them

215
00:09:32,049 --> 00:09:33,809
and regretful for the future

216
00:09:34,529 --> 00:09:35,689
of our Changfeng Academy

217
00:09:35,689 --> 00:09:36,689
and Dragon Mountain Empire.

218
00:09:37,529 --> 00:09:38,450
(It turns out)

219
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:40,330
(that no one)

220
00:09:40,730 --> 00:09:42,409
(has ever had high hopes for me.)

221
00:09:47,409 --> 00:09:48,769
There is no other way here.

222
00:09:48,769 --> 00:09:50,409
Can we only leave from above?

223
00:10:01,649 --> 00:10:02,889
The space here

224
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:03,809
is much larger

225
00:10:03,809 --> 00:10:04,649
than we imagined.

226
00:10:05,169 --> 00:10:06,409
It's like being inside a glass dome.

227
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:08,130
The place is isolated
from the outside world.

228
00:10:08,490 --> 00:10:10,289
Although we luckily survived,

229
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:11,529
we're trapped here

230
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:12,610
and unable to do anything.

231
00:10:13,130 --> 00:10:14,889
It seems that leaving the bottom
of the Black Wind Cliff

232
00:10:14,889 --> 00:10:16,289
is not an easy task.

233
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:19,649
I originally thought

234
00:10:20,049 --> 00:10:20,809
I would have to spend some time

235
00:10:20,809 --> 00:10:22,130
here alone.

236
00:10:22,889 --> 00:10:23,809
But who would have thought

237
00:10:23,970 --> 00:10:25,090
that heaven is so kind to me,

238
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:27,090
sending a fairy down?

239
00:10:28,330 --> 00:10:30,289
You sound quite right.

240
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:31,929
So,

241
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:33,090
shouldn't we

242
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,529
cherish our time here more?

243
00:10:37,649 --> 00:10:38,649
Well, Jingqiu,

244
00:10:39,049 --> 00:10:39,529
look,

245
00:10:40,049 --> 00:10:41,649
does this look like

246
00:10:41,970 --> 00:10:43,330
the colorful fireworks
you mentioned earlier?

247
00:10:44,649 --> 00:10:45,210
Yes,

248
00:10:45,689 --> 00:10:46,409
it's very beautiful.

249
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:56,850
Wait a moment.

250
00:11:01,806 --> 00:11:05,787
♪Rain falls, kissing the flowers♪

251
00:11:05,787 --> 00:11:09,688
♪The sound of a zither,

252
00:11:09,688 --> 00:11:14,289
♪Who's far away and worried♪

253
00:11:14,289 --> 00:11:15,289
Xueying

254
00:11:15,289 --> 00:11:16,529
spared them today.

255
00:11:16,649 --> 00:11:18,090
It shows your kindness.

256
00:11:18,169 --> 00:11:18,809
Well,

257
00:11:18,970 --> 00:11:20,370
let me reward you with something else.

258
00:11:20,370 --> 00:11:21,250
What do you want?

259
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:24,889
I'll have to think about it.

260
00:11:25,730 --> 00:11:26,570
Close your eyes first.

261
00:11:28,110 --> 00:11:32,858
♪Half a life of sandstorms,
half a life of noise♪

262
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:36,992
♪All are accepted with a smile♪

263
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:37,929
You are truly beautiful.

264
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,330
Xueying,

265
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:43,529
stop right there!

266
00:11:44,366 --> 00:11:49,048
♪Where is the one♪

267
00:11:50,250 --> 00:11:51,529
You can't catch me!

268
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:53,409
Xueying!

269
00:11:53,582 --> 00:11:58,542
♪Crossing the wind and snow,
I will arrive♪

270
00:11:58,668 --> 00:12:02,667
♪Regardless of the changes

272
00:12:08,024 --> 00:12:11,503
♪Waiting for the past and snowflakes

273
00:12:12,970 --> 00:12:13,769
I didn't expect

274
00:12:13,769 --> 00:12:15,009
you could build a house.

275
00:12:15,730 --> 00:12:16,809
It seems we're really planning

276
00:12:16,809 --> 00:12:18,169
to stay here for some time.

277
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,450
I'm just worried

278
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,570
that you won't sleep well.

279
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:25,769
By the way,

280
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:26,769
do you think

281
00:12:26,889 --> 00:12:28,130
we're missing something?

282
00:12:28,649 --> 00:12:29,970
A little bit.

283
00:12:34,850 --> 00:12:35,850
I think

284
00:12:36,330 --> 00:12:37,689
there should be a door here.

285
00:12:40,730 --> 00:12:42,450
And then open a window on this side.

286
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:43,130
Alright.

287
00:12:44,850 --> 00:12:45,730
And here,

288
00:12:46,049 --> 00:12:46,889
install a staircase.

289
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,169
Also,

290
00:12:48,330 --> 00:12:49,529
there must be a terrace.

291
00:12:49,529 --> 00:12:50,130
So we can

292
00:12:50,130 --> 00:12:51,370
sit together and enjoy the view.

293
00:12:51,689 --> 00:12:52,169
Alright.

294
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:53,130
Get started.

295
00:13:00,570 --> 00:13:02,250
You must practice diligently

296
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,210
because you are

297
00:13:04,210 --> 00:13:04,929
the protectors
of the Dragon Mountain Empire.

298
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:05,529
Uncle Master.

299
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:07,250
Uncle Master,

300
00:13:07,450 --> 00:13:08,689
Lin Mao and Xiuzhu

301
00:13:08,689 --> 00:13:09,250
have gone missing.

302
00:13:09,689 --> 00:13:10,529
When did this happen?

303
00:13:11,009 --> 00:13:11,570
The two of them

304
00:13:11,570 --> 00:13:12,570
were originally responsible

305
00:13:12,570 --> 00:13:13,409
for the maintenance
and cleaning of the library.

306
00:13:13,809 --> 00:13:14,289
But today,

307
00:13:14,289 --> 00:13:15,570
they still didn't appear.

308
00:13:16,049 --> 00:13:17,090
Have their dormitories been checked?

309
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,330
Yes, but they're not there.

310
00:13:18,889 --> 00:13:19,330
By the way,

311
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:20,330
their beds

312
00:13:20,330 --> 00:13:21,090
haven't been touched.

313
00:13:21,330 --> 00:13:22,490
They didn't come back yesterday?

314
00:13:23,009 --> 00:13:23,730
It seems so.

315
00:13:25,850 --> 00:13:26,570
I see.

316
00:13:26,769 --> 00:13:27,570
You go back first.

317
00:13:27,929 --> 00:13:29,169
I'll arrange for the disciples
to search them.

318
00:13:29,289 --> 00:13:29,809
Yes.

319
00:13:32,730 --> 00:13:33,370
You just heard what happened,

320
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:34,130
didn't you?

321
00:13:34,130 --> 00:13:35,049
Yes.

322
00:13:36,330 --> 00:13:37,970
You go search the academy in the groups

323
00:13:38,570 --> 00:13:39,970
listed in the roster.

324
00:13:40,529 --> 00:13:41,289
Yes.

325
00:13:45,889 --> 00:13:46,929
You not only need to find

326
00:13:46,929 --> 00:13:48,169
the traces of them,

327
00:13:48,529 --> 00:13:49,809
but also record the situation

328
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:50,769
of the academy.

329
00:13:51,169 --> 00:13:52,130
Report any abnormalities

330
00:13:52,130 --> 00:13:53,169
to me immediately.

331
00:13:53,570 --> 00:13:54,570
Understood.

332
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:55,250
Remember,

333
00:13:56,009 --> 00:13:56,889
safety first.

334
00:13:57,090 --> 00:13:58,090
Protect yourselves.

335
00:13:58,809 --> 00:13:59,889
- Yes.
- Yes.

336
00:14:22,769 --> 00:14:23,649
A demon bell?

337
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:25,409
How could something

338
00:14:25,409 --> 00:14:26,970
from the Demon Clan
appear in Changfeng Academy?

339
00:14:28,330 --> 00:14:28,850
This is bad.

340
00:14:36,289 --> 00:14:37,970
A demon bell has appeared
in Changfeng Academy.

341
00:14:38,289 --> 00:14:38,889
Last night,

342
00:14:39,330 --> 00:14:40,889
two disciples went missing.

343
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:42,610
Missing?

344
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:45,689
You mean the Demon Clan did it?

345
00:14:45,769 --> 00:14:46,730
The Demon Clan should be

346
00:14:47,049 --> 00:14:48,330
preparing for their next move.

347
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:49,929
The Demon Clan would capture

348
00:14:49,929 --> 00:14:52,090
the disciples of Changfeng Academy.

349
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,490
I don't know what they're planning

350
00:14:54,490 --> 00:14:55,490
to do next.

351
00:14:56,370 --> 00:14:57,769
After the battle at the Sea God Palace,

352
00:14:57,929 --> 00:14:59,009
the Demon Clan should have quickly

353
00:14:59,009 --> 00:15:00,130
attacked the Demon Well.

354
00:15:00,649 --> 00:15:02,850
But they've been slow to act.

355
00:15:03,210 --> 00:15:03,610
Now,

356
00:15:03,610 --> 00:15:05,490
they suddenly captured
Changfeng disciples.

357
00:15:06,529 --> 00:15:07,450
This indicates

358
00:15:07,769 --> 00:15:09,689
that their reserve power
is insufficient.

359
00:15:10,049 --> 00:15:11,889
If it's really as you said,

360
00:15:12,409 --> 00:15:13,610
the Demon Clan will definitely

361
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,049
capture more our disciples.

362
00:15:15,289 --> 00:15:17,009
We must be fully prepared.

363
00:15:17,610 --> 00:15:18,970
Right now, we are in the open,

364
00:15:19,090 --> 00:15:20,370
and the Demon Clan is hidden.

365
00:15:20,929 --> 00:15:23,049
I'm afraid we can only
wait for them to act.

366
00:15:23,130 --> 00:15:24,009
I will arrange for the disciples

367
00:15:24,009 --> 00:15:24,889
to take turns on guard duty,

368
00:15:25,330 --> 00:15:26,450
to ensure their safety.

369
00:15:26,689 --> 00:15:27,450
All sects

370
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,769
must also be careful.

371
00:15:47,289 --> 00:15:47,970
Xueying,

372
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:48,850
look,

373
00:15:49,169 --> 00:15:49,929
this is for you.

374
00:15:50,289 --> 00:15:51,130
Do you like it?

375
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:52,090
Yes.

376
00:15:53,130 --> 00:15:53,730
But,

377
00:15:53,889 --> 00:15:54,929
where should we put it?

378
00:15:55,529 --> 00:15:56,210
Let's put it

379
00:15:57,689 --> 00:15:58,689
here.

380
00:16:01,570 --> 00:16:02,210
Isn't it nice?

381
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:02,689
Yeah.

382
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:05,529
Fairy, take a look at the door I made.

383
00:16:09,769 --> 00:16:11,009
There is a bed.

384
00:16:13,970 --> 00:16:15,009
Very comfortable.

385
00:16:15,009 --> 00:16:15,850
It's very soft.

386
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:17,090
As long as you like it.

387
00:16:17,169 --> 00:16:18,649
I was afraid you wouldn't sleep well.

388
00:16:19,529 --> 00:16:20,610
You should try lying down, too.

389
00:16:20,689 --> 00:16:21,169
Alright.

390
00:16:37,450 --> 00:16:38,689
I just saw that the scenery outside

391
00:16:38,689 --> 00:16:39,370
was beautiful.

392
00:16:39,409 --> 00:16:40,330
Let's watch it together.

393
00:16:41,289 --> 00:16:41,769
Okay.

394
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:42,809
Come on.

395
00:16:46,809 --> 00:16:47,809
It's true.

396
00:16:48,169 --> 00:16:48,689
Yeah.

397
00:16:49,570 --> 00:16:50,610
So beautiful.

398
00:16:52,169 --> 00:16:53,130
Chilled wild fruit.

399
00:16:58,330 --> 00:16:59,130
Is it delicious?

400
00:17:01,490 --> 00:17:02,169
It's really sweet.

401
00:17:02,330 --> 00:17:02,889
Really?

402
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:03,330
Oh!

403
00:17:08,649 --> 00:17:09,810
It's quite sour.

404
00:17:09,889 --> 00:17:10,649
No.

405
00:17:12,050 --> 00:17:13,330
All the ones you gave me are sweet.

406
00:17:16,409 --> 00:17:17,090
Really?

407
00:17:17,770 --> 00:17:18,810
Then you can have another one.

408
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:19,249
Alright.

409
00:17:58,649 --> 00:17:59,409
Master.

410
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,209
This...

411
00:18:00,209 --> 00:18:00,770
Master.

412
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,409
This is an object of the Demon Clan.

413
00:18:03,090 --> 00:18:03,770
Have you seen it before?

414
00:18:04,330 --> 00:18:05,090
I've heard of it.

415
00:18:05,209 --> 00:18:05,889
However,

416
00:18:06,050 --> 00:18:07,169
why would this object of the Demon Clan

417
00:18:07,370 --> 00:18:08,850
appear in our Changfeng Academy?

418
00:18:09,570 --> 00:18:10,489
I called you both here

419
00:18:10,729 --> 00:18:12,130
because of this.

420
00:18:12,570 --> 00:18:13,570
I have an important mission

421
00:18:13,570 --> 00:18:14,489
for you to complete.

422
00:18:14,969 --> 00:18:16,649
It must be nothing good.

423
00:18:20,610 --> 00:18:21,770
Please give us your instructions,
Master.

424
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:24,929
First, disciples went missing
in the academy.

425
00:18:25,249 --> 00:18:26,689
Then, we discovered the object
of the Demon Clan.

426
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:28,570
It must be related to the Demon Clan.

427
00:18:29,290 --> 00:18:30,649
Now we have set up barriers

428
00:18:30,649 --> 00:18:31,330
in important places

429
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,330
within Changfeng Academy,

430
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:33,810
which can prevent external invasions.

431
00:18:34,489 --> 00:18:35,770
But for the sake of safety,

432
00:18:36,169 --> 00:18:36,969
we still need the disciples

433
00:18:36,969 --> 00:18:37,850
to take turns on guard duty.

434
00:18:38,370 --> 00:18:40,330
I knew it wouldn't be anything good.

435
00:18:41,570 --> 00:18:42,249
This should have been

436
00:18:42,249 --> 00:18:43,449
your seniors' responsibility.

437
00:18:44,169 --> 00:18:45,370
But now the Demon Clan

438
00:18:45,449 --> 00:18:46,330
keeps provoking us.

439
00:18:46,810 --> 00:18:48,169
The higher-level disciples

440
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,770
have all gone to search
for the Demon Clan's whereabouts.

441
00:18:50,010 --> 00:18:50,729
So we need you

442
00:18:50,729 --> 00:18:51,729
to join the guard duty.

443
00:18:52,130 --> 00:18:53,050
Can you complete it?

444
00:18:54,290 --> 00:18:56,050
We will definitely
live up to your trust.

445
00:18:59,290 --> 00:18:59,770
We can.

446
00:19:03,966 --> 00:19:06,464
(Orchid & Bamboo Yard)

447
00:19:47,610 --> 00:19:48,330
Si Borong.

448
00:19:54,489 --> 00:19:55,090
Hong,

449
00:19:55,489 --> 00:19:56,209
I'm so sleepy.

450
00:19:56,209 --> 00:19:57,290
Let me sleep for a while, please.

451
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:58,770
It's not time to change shifts yet.

452
00:19:59,290 --> 00:20:00,330
Go back and keep watch.

453
00:20:01,249 --> 00:20:02,249
Our dormitory area

454
00:20:02,249 --> 00:20:03,050
is so quiet.

455
00:20:03,249 --> 00:20:04,169
Not to mention the Demon Clan,

456
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:05,770
there isn't even a single spirit bug.

457
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:06,929
Stop right there.

458
00:20:12,489 --> 00:20:13,209
Have you forgotten

459
00:20:13,209 --> 00:20:14,330
what happened at Nanqin before?

460
00:20:14,729 --> 00:20:15,850
Due to our negligence,

461
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,489
we gave the Demon Clan
an opportunity to take advantage,

462
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:19,010
which resulted in our aunt
being punished

463
00:20:19,010 --> 00:20:19,929
and the Si Family being blamed.

464
00:20:20,489 --> 00:20:21,290
Now we finally have

465
00:20:21,290 --> 00:20:22,969
a fresh start at Changfeng Academy.

466
00:20:23,249 --> 00:20:23,770
Do you really want

467
00:20:23,969 --> 00:20:24,649
to continue

468
00:20:24,649 --> 00:20:25,610
being looked down upon?

469
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:27,610
Just be on duty.

470
00:20:28,290 --> 00:20:29,610
Why so serious?

471
00:20:29,889 --> 00:20:31,090
I'm going, alright?

472
00:20:53,889 --> 00:20:54,610
Who's there?

473
00:20:55,370 --> 00:20:56,209
Who?

474
00:20:59,449 --> 00:21:00,689
Hong! Hong!

475
00:21:01,249 --> 00:21:02,209
I'm scared.

476
00:21:03,169 --> 00:21:04,969
There was a shadow
at the barrier just now.

477
00:21:13,570 --> 00:21:14,330
Over there.

478
00:21:22,649 --> 00:21:23,489
What shadow?

479
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,090
Are you sure you saw it clearly?

480
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:26,449
Really.

481
00:21:26,689 --> 00:21:27,409
That shadow

482
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:29,169
was swaying back and forth.

483
00:21:29,810 --> 00:21:30,729
Could it be

484
00:21:30,969 --> 00:21:32,290
that my eyes were playing tricks on me?

485
00:21:32,290 --> 00:21:33,010
Could you stop

486
00:21:33,010 --> 00:21:33,929
pulling these little tricks

487
00:21:33,929 --> 00:21:34,729
just to slack off?

488
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:36,249
Our master asked us to stand guard

489
00:21:36,449 --> 00:21:37,810
because he trusts us.

490
00:21:38,290 --> 00:21:39,330
Do you want the people of the Si Family

491
00:21:39,330 --> 00:21:40,530
to continue being looked down upon?

492
00:21:41,209 --> 00:21:41,729
Hong,

493
00:21:42,290 --> 00:21:43,090
do you think

494
00:21:43,449 --> 00:21:45,169
there might be some unknown objects?

495
00:21:47,409 --> 00:21:47,929
Hong,

496
00:21:48,370 --> 00:21:50,689
why don't you come with me?

497
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,290
I'm scared to go alone.

498
00:21:52,290 --> 00:21:53,209
If you can't even handle

499
00:21:53,209 --> 00:21:54,050
such a small task as being on duty,

500
00:21:54,370 --> 00:21:55,489
how will you fight the Demon Clan

501
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,649
and revitalize the Si Family
in the future?

502
00:21:58,449 --> 00:21:59,130
Get out.

503
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:02,810
Get out.

504
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:34,929
Who's there?

505
00:22:38,889 --> 00:22:39,929
Who is it?

506
00:22:56,370 --> 00:22:57,370
(We need to)

507
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,370
(strengthen our defenses
at these places.)

508
00:23:02,610 --> 00:23:03,330
Master.

509
00:23:03,530 --> 00:23:04,169
What's the matter?

510
00:23:04,169 --> 00:23:05,249
Si Borong is missing.

511
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:05,969
Missing?

512
00:23:06,370 --> 00:23:07,889
Yesterday we took turns on guard duty.

513
00:23:07,929 --> 00:23:09,169
When it was my turn to change shifts,

514
00:23:09,249 --> 00:23:10,290
he was already gone.

515
00:23:16,584 --> 00:23:19,449
(Orchid & Bamboo Yard)

516
00:23:19,449 --> 00:23:20,130
Si Borong,

517
00:23:20,649 --> 00:23:21,770
it's time to change shifts.

518
00:23:21,889 --> 00:23:22,929
Go back and rest.

519
00:23:28,409 --> 00:23:29,249
Si Borong!

520
00:23:31,570 --> 00:23:32,409
Si Borong!

521
00:23:34,370 --> 00:23:35,050
At first, I thought

522
00:23:35,050 --> 00:23:36,370
that Borong was just
slacking off and playing,

523
00:23:36,530 --> 00:23:37,169
but I didn't expect

524
00:23:37,330 --> 00:23:38,770
that he still didn't come back

525
00:23:39,010 --> 00:23:39,929
when the cafeteria started
serving breakfast this morning.

526
00:23:40,810 --> 00:23:41,810
Go check the barrier.

527
00:23:57,130 --> 00:23:58,290
It's the Demon Clan's technique.

528
00:23:59,169 --> 00:23:59,810
Demon Clan's technique?

529
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:00,449
Demon Clan's technique?

530
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:01,370
What about Si Borong?

531
00:24:01,729 --> 00:24:02,929
It seems that the Demon Clan
has calculated

532
00:24:02,929 --> 00:24:04,090
the time for updating the barrier

533
00:24:04,850 --> 00:24:05,929
and took Si Borong away

534
00:24:05,929 --> 00:24:07,130
from its weak point.

535
00:24:09,290 --> 00:24:10,689
Everyone must stay inside the academy.

536
00:24:10,969 --> 00:24:12,050
You cannot break through the barrier.

537
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,409
Violators

538
00:24:14,010 --> 00:24:14,770
will be severely punished.

539
00:24:16,090 --> 00:24:17,010
- Yes.
- Yes.

540
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:17,570
Yes.

541
00:24:28,969 --> 00:24:29,850
Do you think

542
00:24:30,090 --> 00:24:31,689
there might be some unknown objects?

543
00:24:32,209 --> 00:24:32,810
Hong,

544
00:24:33,090 --> 00:24:34,050
why don't you

545
00:24:34,290 --> 00:24:35,409
come with me?

546
00:24:35,850 --> 00:24:37,249
I'm scared to go alone.

547
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,330
If you can't even handle

548
00:24:38,330 --> 00:24:39,050
such a small task as being on duty,

549
00:24:39,209 --> 00:24:40,449
how will you fight the Demon Clan

550
00:24:40,530 --> 00:24:41,570
and revitalize the Si Family
in the future?

551
00:24:43,209 --> 00:24:43,929
Get out.

552
00:24:59,090 --> 00:25:01,010
(Borong's disappearance was my fault.)

553
00:25:01,290 --> 00:25:02,810
(Even if he's in the hands
of the Demon Clan,)

554
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:04,689
(I have to find him and bring him back.)

555
00:25:05,530 --> 00:25:06,169
I don't believe

556
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:07,610
that Xueying is dead.

557
00:25:08,249 --> 00:25:09,889
He must be somewhere,

558
00:25:10,169 --> 00:25:11,209
alive and well.

559
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:12,370
Maybe

560
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:14,130
he's trying to find a way to find us.

561
00:25:17,330 --> 00:25:18,290
Without Xueying,

562
00:25:18,409 --> 00:25:19,689
we must live well

563
00:25:19,889 --> 00:25:20,649
and practice hard.

564
00:25:20,649 --> 00:25:21,370
One day,

565
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:22,770
we must avenge him.

566
00:25:25,689 --> 00:25:26,209
Who is it?

567
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:30,610
It's Situ Hong.

568
00:25:34,889 --> 00:25:35,330
Why is he going out alone

569
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,570
so late?

570
00:25:36,570 --> 00:25:37,449
Could it be that our master

571
00:25:37,449 --> 00:25:38,209
has assigned him

572
00:25:38,209 --> 00:25:39,489
a special mission?

573
00:25:42,290 --> 00:25:42,889
Never mind that.

574
00:25:42,889 --> 00:25:43,729
Let's first fix

575
00:25:43,770 --> 00:25:44,249
this crack.

576
00:25:59,449 --> 00:26:00,169
Have you heard it?

577
00:26:00,489 --> 00:26:01,090
Last night,

578
00:26:01,090 --> 00:26:02,209
two more disciples went missing.

579
00:26:03,090 --> 00:26:05,330
Could they have been captured
by the Demon Clan?

580
00:26:05,889 --> 00:26:06,649
It seems likely.

581
00:26:06,729 --> 00:26:07,409
What's going on?

582
00:26:07,409 --> 00:26:07,850
This morning,

583
00:26:07,850 --> 00:26:08,969
our master discovered traces
of the barrier being loosened

584
00:26:08,969 --> 00:26:10,570
while patrolling with others.

585
00:26:10,570 --> 00:26:11,929
The barrier can become loose?

586
00:26:12,610 --> 00:26:13,570
Didn't our master forbid

587
00:26:13,570 --> 00:26:14,570
anyone from entering or leaving?

588
00:26:15,010 --> 00:26:16,249
It seems that Changfeng Academy

589
00:26:16,530 --> 00:26:18,050
isn't quite safe, either.

590
00:26:18,810 --> 00:26:20,409
Keep it down, keep it down.

591
00:26:20,689 --> 00:26:21,530
Continue practicing.
Continue practicing.

592
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,169
I don't think we should

593
00:26:23,169 --> 00:26:24,169
continue to conceal this.

594
00:26:31,649 --> 00:26:32,409
Master.

595
00:26:32,489 --> 00:26:33,370
Master.

596
00:26:35,249 --> 00:26:35,889
Master.

597
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,010
What's the matter?

598
00:26:38,729 --> 00:26:39,570
Master,

599
00:26:39,649 --> 00:26:41,689
yesterday, I...

600
00:26:41,689 --> 00:26:43,169
Last night, we saw Situ Hong

601
00:26:43,169 --> 00:26:44,050
leaving the barrier.

602
00:26:44,249 --> 00:26:45,090
He went out?

603
00:26:45,770 --> 00:26:46,409
Yes.

604
00:26:46,649 --> 00:26:48,409
We were in a hurry to repair the barrier

605
00:26:48,409 --> 00:26:49,729
and didn't report it in time.

606
00:26:49,969 --> 00:26:51,530
Recently, more disciples
have gone missing.

607
00:26:51,530 --> 00:26:52,330
We're sorry, Master.

608
00:26:52,330 --> 00:26:53,729
We should have reported it promptly.

609
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:54,889
Did you see it clearly?

610
00:26:55,130 --> 00:26:56,689
No mistake, it was him.

611
00:26:56,770 --> 00:26:57,610
Where is he now?

612
00:26:57,850 --> 00:26:59,330
He's practicing in the Practice Field.

613
00:27:06,330 --> 00:27:06,770
Master.

614
00:27:06,770 --> 00:27:07,570
Master.

615
00:27:08,130 --> 00:27:08,850
Situ Hong,

616
00:27:09,090 --> 00:27:09,689
did you leave the barrier

617
00:27:09,689 --> 00:27:10,489
last night?

618
00:27:13,729 --> 00:27:14,249
Yes.

619
00:27:14,530 --> 00:27:15,810
What did I say last night?

620
00:27:16,290 --> 00:27:17,929
No one is allowed
to break through the barrier.

621
00:27:18,130 --> 00:27:19,449
Didn't you understand my words?

622
00:27:19,449 --> 00:27:20,570
I went to find my brother.

623
00:27:20,689 --> 00:27:21,610
It doesn't matter
who you're looking for.

624
00:27:23,249 --> 00:27:24,770
Now the Demon Clan is rampant outside.

625
00:27:25,130 --> 00:27:26,370
What if you encounter them?

626
00:27:26,570 --> 00:27:27,810
But I am his elder brother.

627
00:27:28,449 --> 00:27:30,249
Si Borong is waiting for me
to take him home.

628
00:27:30,729 --> 00:27:32,249
Even if I'm shattered to pieces,

629
00:27:32,570 --> 00:27:33,689
I won't hesitate.

630
00:27:33,689 --> 00:27:35,370
I won't disgrace Changfeng Academy.

631
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:36,290
You don't understand

632
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:37,530
the complexity of the situation outside.

633
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:39,530
Your unauthorized breakthrough
of the barrier

634
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,489
will cause cracks in it.

635
00:27:41,489 --> 00:27:42,729
It will give the Demon Clan
an opportunity

636
00:27:42,729 --> 00:27:44,090
to enter easily.

637
00:27:44,090 --> 00:27:45,130
No matter what happens,

638
00:27:45,169 --> 00:27:46,370
I must find Si Borong

639
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:47,689
and save everyone.

640
00:27:50,929 --> 00:27:51,889
It seems you still don't know

641
00:27:51,889 --> 00:27:52,770
where you're wrong.

642
00:27:53,530 --> 00:27:54,050
I'm

643
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,850
not wrong.

644
00:28:00,649 --> 00:28:02,449
I think you haven't been punished
enough.

645
00:28:03,449 --> 00:28:04,729
Then, you'll be punished
by continuous practice

646
00:28:04,729 --> 00:28:06,050
until you think clearly.

647
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:10,929
Academy rules.

648
00:28:43,729 --> 00:28:44,330
I didn't expect

649
00:28:44,330 --> 00:28:45,330
there would be such fruits to eat here.

650
00:28:45,409 --> 00:28:46,449
It seems that for the next few days,

651
00:28:46,449 --> 00:28:47,530
we can rely on wild fruits...

652
00:28:52,370 --> 00:28:53,570
They captured two more yesterday.

653
00:28:53,729 --> 00:28:54,409
Yes.

654
00:28:54,570 --> 00:28:55,649
Our numbers are growing.

655
00:28:55,810 --> 00:28:56,530
Our team

656
00:28:56,530 --> 00:28:57,489
is getting stronger and stronger.

657
00:28:58,850 --> 00:28:59,530
I didn't expect

658
00:28:59,530 --> 00:29:00,770
there would be others besides us.

659
00:29:01,090 --> 00:29:02,010
They just said

660
00:29:02,010 --> 00:29:03,169
that they had added two more people.

661
00:29:03,489 --> 00:29:04,649
They should be referring to us.

662
00:29:05,330 --> 00:29:05,929
We must be

663
00:29:05,929 --> 00:29:06,969
under their surveillance.

664
00:29:07,409 --> 00:29:08,810
But where are they going?

665
00:29:09,169 --> 00:29:10,249
Is there any place

666
00:29:10,689 --> 00:29:11,489
at the bottom of the Black Wind Cliff

667
00:29:11,489 --> 00:29:12,489
that we don't know about?

668
00:29:13,169 --> 00:29:14,090
Let's follow them and see.

669
00:29:25,010 --> 00:29:25,570
No.

670
00:29:27,290 --> 00:29:28,489
There must be some kind of barrier here.

671
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:30,850
Before we find a way

672
00:29:30,850 --> 00:29:32,169
to leave Black Wind Cliff,

673
00:29:32,169 --> 00:29:32,889
we'll certainly see

674
00:29:32,889 --> 00:29:33,729
their traces again.

675
00:29:33,729 --> 00:29:34,290
That's right.

676
00:29:34,449 --> 00:29:35,689
We'll set up an ambush in advance.

677
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,489
You only captured these people?

678
00:29:41,689 --> 00:29:42,570
Changfeng Academy has recently

679
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:43,130
strengthened its guard

680
00:29:43,330 --> 00:29:44,649
and set up a special barrier.

681
00:29:44,649 --> 00:29:45,929
It's difficult for us to succeed.

682
00:29:46,249 --> 00:29:48,370
Let's modify these kids first.

683
00:29:59,850 --> 00:30:00,290
Go!

684
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:15,810
Who are you?

685
00:30:16,090 --> 00:30:18,570
- Demon!
- Demon!

686
00:30:19,249 --> 00:30:20,969
Who is your master?

687
00:30:20,969 --> 00:30:23,810
- Demon!
- Demon!

688
00:30:39,729 --> 00:30:40,889
Situ Hong is indeed a

689
00:30:40,889 --> 00:30:41,969
good martial arts talent.

690
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:43,969
But his personality is too extreme.

691
00:30:44,209 --> 00:30:44,810
Yes,

692
00:30:45,050 --> 00:30:45,889
he never listens to

693
00:30:45,889 --> 00:30:46,889
other people's advice.

694
00:30:47,090 --> 00:30:48,570
If he's exploited by others
in the future,

695
00:30:49,169 --> 00:30:50,370
trouble is inevitable.

696
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:53,130
We must strictly discipline him.

697
00:30:54,130 --> 00:30:55,050
From now on,

698
00:30:55,050 --> 00:30:56,610
we can only gradually
temper his temperament.

699
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:31,610
Situ Hong,

700
00:31:34,649 --> 00:31:35,689
you're courting death.

701
00:31:35,810 --> 00:31:36,969
You dare to leave the barrier again!

702
00:31:37,370 --> 00:31:38,050
Get away.

703
00:31:38,290 --> 00:31:39,090
You can't go.

704
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:42,889
Get away.

705
00:31:48,050 --> 00:31:49,689
Situ Hong, what are you doing?

706
00:31:51,370 --> 00:31:52,409
What I do

707
00:31:53,010 --> 00:31:54,409
has nothing to do with you.

708
00:31:54,810 --> 00:31:56,130
If it weren't for your
unauthorized barrier breach,

709
00:31:56,130 --> 00:31:57,010
causing cracks

710
00:31:57,090 --> 00:31:58,169
and giving the Demon Clan
an opportunity,

711
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,850
the other disciples
wouldn't have been captured.

712
00:32:00,449 --> 00:32:01,290
You never understood

713
00:32:01,290 --> 00:32:02,449
our master's warning.

714
00:32:02,810 --> 00:32:03,610
There are people missing

715
00:32:03,610 --> 00:32:04,969
in Changfeng Academy every day,

716
00:32:05,969 --> 00:32:07,330
yet you blame all the responsibility

717
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,850
on me alone.

718
00:32:09,850 --> 00:32:10,729
Kong Youyue,

719
00:32:10,889 --> 00:32:12,010
I know you don't like me,

720
00:32:12,889 --> 00:32:14,290
but there's no need
to target me like this.

721
00:32:14,489 --> 00:32:15,370
You really

722
00:32:15,370 --> 00:32:16,770
don't know how to appreciate kindness.

723
00:32:17,209 --> 00:32:19,130
Now Xueying, Jingqiu,

724
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:20,010
and Si Borong

725
00:32:20,010 --> 00:32:21,169
are all missing,

726
00:32:21,489 --> 00:32:22,489
and the Demon Clan is running rampant.

727
00:32:22,929 --> 00:32:24,530
You still want to go out alone?

728
00:32:24,929 --> 00:32:26,370
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

729
00:32:26,770 --> 00:32:28,249
If you're afraid of death,

730
00:32:29,130 --> 00:32:30,409
just stay here.

731
00:32:31,130 --> 00:32:31,850
The important thing now is

732
00:32:31,850 --> 00:32:33,290
everyone's safety in the academy.

733
00:32:33,530 --> 00:32:34,729
I'll say it one last time.

734
00:32:35,810 --> 00:32:36,449
Make way.

735
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:37,610
Anyway,

736
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:38,850
you're not

737
00:32:38,850 --> 00:32:39,489
leaving the barrier today,

738
00:32:39,489 --> 00:32:40,290
no matter what you say.

739
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:40,850
Enough.

740
00:32:42,689 --> 00:32:43,449
Situ Hong,

741
00:32:43,969 --> 00:32:45,370
the Demon Clan has already
taken advantage

742
00:32:45,370 --> 00:32:46,290
of the cracks in the barrier before.

743
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:47,889
If any more disciples go missing

744
00:32:47,889 --> 00:32:48,729
because of this,

745
00:32:48,729 --> 00:32:50,330
it would be truly inescapable guilt.

746
00:32:50,489 --> 00:32:51,689
Calm down.

747
00:32:51,889 --> 00:32:53,249
Even if it's for everyone's sake,

748
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,050
don't break

749
00:32:54,050 --> 00:32:54,969
the academy's rules anymore.

750
00:32:55,209 --> 00:32:56,489
If it were Dongbo Xueying's brother

751
00:32:56,489 --> 00:32:57,209
who was missing,

752
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,770
would you still do nothing

753
00:33:00,489 --> 00:33:01,689
and just talk about rules
and regulations?

754
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,010
Situ Hong,

755
00:33:10,969 --> 00:33:12,050
no matter what you say today,

756
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:13,689
don't think about leaving here.

757
00:33:19,770 --> 00:33:21,050
It's not your brother,

758
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,209
so of course, you don't care.

759
00:33:40,875 --> 00:33:42,939
(Changfeng Academy)

760
00:33:42,939 --> 00:33:45,272
(Orchid & Bamboo Yard)

761
00:33:48,330 --> 00:33:49,050
Puyang Bo.

762
00:33:49,929 --> 00:33:50,649
Youyue.

763
00:33:53,729 --> 00:33:54,489
Your clothes.

764
00:33:54,689 --> 00:33:55,249
As soon as they are dry,

765
00:33:55,249 --> 00:33:56,209
I bring them to you.

766
00:33:58,010 --> 00:33:58,889
I never thought that one day,

767
00:33:58,889 --> 00:33:59,889
I'd get clothes

768
00:33:59,889 --> 00:34:00,810
hand-washed by you.

769
00:34:00,889 --> 00:34:02,130
Cherish them.

770
00:34:02,290 --> 00:34:03,729
If you hadn't forced them on me,

771
00:34:03,729 --> 00:34:04,850
I wouldn't have washed them for you.

772
00:34:05,489 --> 00:34:06,249
I rarely

773
00:34:06,290 --> 00:34:07,370
wash clothes for someone.

774
00:34:08,729 --> 00:34:09,130
Fine,

775
00:34:09,530 --> 00:34:10,970
I'll put them under my pillow.

776
00:34:10,970 --> 00:34:12,570
I'll sleep on them every night.

777
00:34:13,209 --> 00:34:14,530
Clothes are meant to be worn.

778
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:15,769
What's the point of sleeping on them?

779
00:34:15,769 --> 00:34:16,930
Put them on now.

780
00:34:17,890 --> 00:34:18,289
Okay.

781
00:34:25,249 --> 00:34:27,090
Why is there color contamination?

782
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:30,169
This contaminated color
is pretty good, too.

783
00:34:30,169 --> 00:34:31,010
It's unique.

784
00:34:31,010 --> 00:34:32,209
At least, it won't get mixed up

785
00:34:32,209 --> 00:34:32,930
with other people's clothes.

786
00:34:34,169 --> 00:34:35,289
How could I have washed the clothes

787
00:34:35,289 --> 00:34:36,329
and caused color contamination?

788
00:34:36,769 --> 00:34:37,530
Take a rest.

789
00:34:37,530 --> 00:34:38,769
I'll put the clothes away.

790
00:34:39,090 --> 00:34:40,090
Have a sip of water.

791
00:34:40,689 --> 00:34:41,410
So early in the morning,

792
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:42,369
you two

793
00:34:42,890 --> 00:34:43,610
are being noisy.

794
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,689
This is a shared space.

795
00:34:46,689 --> 00:34:47,689
It's not

796
00:34:47,729 --> 00:34:48,729
bedtime yet.

797
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,970
If you find us noisy,

798
00:34:49,970 --> 00:34:50,970
you can leave.

799
00:35:00,570 --> 00:35:02,209
You chose to leave.

800
00:35:02,209 --> 00:35:03,329
I didn't chase you away.

801
00:35:07,530 --> 00:35:08,729
What's hidden here?

802
00:35:08,769 --> 00:35:09,689
Youyue, no, no.

803
00:35:14,689 --> 00:35:15,689
Isn't this

804
00:35:15,689 --> 00:35:17,530
the Bloodshed Weapon used
by the Demon Clan

805
00:35:17,530 --> 00:35:18,930
when they attacked the Sea God Palace?

806
00:35:19,450 --> 00:35:20,689
How could it be here?

807
00:35:32,209 --> 00:35:32,930
Go to the storage room.

808
00:35:33,689 --> 00:35:34,169
Go!

809
00:35:36,169 --> 00:35:36,890
My Lord.

810
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,010
It's done?

811
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:39,289
(What kind of goods are these?)

812
00:35:39,410 --> 00:35:40,130
(Not using the main gate)

813
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:41,530
(but transporting
through the small gate.)

814
00:35:46,450 --> 00:35:47,570
My Lord, please take a look.

815
00:35:51,530 --> 00:35:52,809
You've done a good job.

816
00:35:53,010 --> 00:35:55,010
It's indeed the Bloodshed Weapon.

817
00:35:55,209 --> 00:35:55,689
My Lord,

818
00:35:55,809 --> 00:35:57,050
look at

819
00:35:57,090 --> 00:35:58,090
these unique blade patterns.

820
00:35:58,209 --> 00:35:58,890
Moreover,

821
00:35:59,090 --> 00:36:00,809
it contains hidden secrets

822
00:36:00,890 --> 00:36:02,610
no one will know.

823
00:36:10,329 --> 00:36:13,209
The Bloodshed Weapon is
of great importance.

824
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:14,729
In case something happens

825
00:36:14,729 --> 00:36:16,289
in the future,

826
00:36:16,410 --> 00:36:17,450
it's good to have control.

827
00:36:17,610 --> 00:36:20,010
Your consideration is thorough.

828
00:36:20,130 --> 00:36:22,610
This way, we can ensure
foolproof security.

829
00:36:23,369 --> 00:36:24,450
I just don't know

830
00:36:24,610 --> 00:36:26,490
where these Bloodshed Weapons

831
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:28,649
are going to be sold.

832
00:36:29,169 --> 00:36:29,890
No rush.

833
00:36:30,090 --> 00:36:30,970
Just keep them for now.

834
00:36:31,209 --> 00:36:32,649
Such precious weapons,

835
00:36:32,649 --> 00:36:34,050
the longer they are kept,

836
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:35,410
the higher the price.

837
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:36,450
You are wise.

838
00:36:37,729 --> 00:36:40,209
Take good care of them for me.

839
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:41,610
Yes.

840
00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:45,450
(This is our family's stuff.)

841
00:36:45,649 --> 00:36:46,849
(I can recognize)

842
00:36:46,849 --> 00:36:47,410
(these distinctive petal patterns.)

843
00:36:47,610 --> 00:36:48,689
(Could it really be
the Bloodshed Weapon)

844
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:49,649
(my father has sold?)

845
00:36:49,809 --> 00:36:50,450
Youyue,

846
00:36:50,769 --> 00:36:51,649
is there anything strange

847
00:36:51,649 --> 00:36:52,570
about this Bloodshed Weapon?

848
00:36:53,410 --> 00:36:54,490
No, no.

849
00:36:55,410 --> 00:36:56,490
Do you think

850
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:57,050
our master knows

851
00:36:57,050 --> 00:36:58,010
Situ Hong is hiding this?

852
00:36:58,130 --> 00:36:59,130
Should we tell our master?

853
00:37:00,490 --> 00:37:01,369
(I can't take it away.)

854
00:37:01,729 --> 00:37:03,490
(Taking it away would cause trouble.)

855
00:37:04,970 --> 00:37:06,610
(This hidden pattern is very secretive.)

856
00:37:07,010 --> 00:37:08,130
(Only the people of the Kong family)

857
00:37:08,130 --> 00:37:09,450
(know its meaning.)

858
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,450
(There must be a problem in this.)

859
00:37:12,010 --> 00:37:13,849
(I'll find out its origin first.)

860
00:37:14,369 --> 00:37:15,010
Forget it.

861
00:37:15,249 --> 00:37:16,530
Let's not meddle.

862
00:37:16,809 --> 00:37:18,130
If Situ Hong finds out

863
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,249
we touched his things,

864
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:20,209
he will

865
00:37:20,209 --> 00:37:21,329
find fault with us again.

866
00:37:21,849 --> 00:37:22,970
Let's pretend

867
00:37:22,970 --> 00:37:24,329
it never happened today.

868
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:25,769
I'm leaving.

869
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:40,410
Perfect.

870
00:37:40,610 --> 00:37:41,809
If we cooperate in the academy,

871
00:37:41,809 --> 00:37:42,809
we'll definitely get full marks.

872
00:37:43,209 --> 00:37:43,530
Let's go.

873
00:37:47,490 --> 00:37:48,610
Maybe there's a way

874
00:37:48,610 --> 00:37:49,490
at the end of that dark tunnel.

875
00:37:49,970 --> 00:37:50,530
Let's go check it out.

876
00:38:10,970 --> 00:38:11,329
There seems to be something

877
00:38:11,329 --> 00:38:12,369
up ahead.

878
00:38:12,410 --> 00:38:12,769
Let's go.

879
00:38:22,689 --> 00:38:24,090
Why is there a palace here?

880
00:38:25,329 --> 00:38:26,010
Let's go in and have a look.

881
00:38:35,689 --> 00:38:37,050
Who are you?

882
00:38:39,809 --> 00:38:41,010
I'm Dongbo Xueying.

883
00:38:41,329 --> 00:38:42,809
We accidentally fell to the bottom
of the Black Wind Cliff.

884
00:38:42,970 --> 00:38:43,890
May I ask you

885
00:38:44,050 --> 00:38:45,809
how to go up from here?

886
00:38:56,649 --> 00:38:57,289
Are you okay?

887
00:38:57,410 --> 00:38:57,849
