00:01:57,052 --> 00:01:58,291
I always thought the demonic smoke

23
00:01:58,291 --> 00:01:59,211
was suspicious.

24
00:01:59,371 --> 00:02:00,412
So it's you.

25
00:02:30,532 --> 00:02:31,532
Master Sikong,

26
00:02:31,972 --> 00:02:33,731
he's a spy of the Demon Clan

27
00:02:33,851 --> 00:02:35,451
and a traitor to the Xinhuo Palace.

28
00:02:35,571 --> 00:02:37,451
Let me deal with this spy.

29
00:02:50,692 --> 00:02:51,372
Go!

00:03:13,372 --> 00:03:14,132
Chunyuan,

31
00:03:14,212 --> 00:03:14,851
Chunyuan,

32
00:03:14,972 --> 00:03:15,891
what's happened to you, Chunyuan?

33
00:03:16,051 --> 00:03:16,932
Chunyuan.

34
00:03:17,972 --> 00:03:18,492
Chunyuan.

35
00:03:18,891 --> 00:03:19,571
Chunyuan.

36
00:03:20,932 --> 00:03:21,731
Chunyuan.

37
00:03:26,212 --> 00:03:27,492
What's going on?

38
00:03:28,011 --> 00:03:29,051
I just got here.

39
00:03:53,571 --> 00:03:54,611
(We've been fooled.)

40
00:03:54,731 --> 00:03:56,731
(It's the demon-impersonated Xi Yun.)

41
00:03:59,652 --> 00:04:00,132
Master.

42
00:04:00,132 --> 00:04:00,771
Master He.

43
00:04:00,771 --> 00:04:01,331
Master He.

44
00:04:01,331 --> 00:04:01,891
Master He.

45
00:04:01,891 --> 00:04:02,252
Master He.

46
00:04:02,252 --> 00:04:02,771
Master.

47
00:04:03,331 --> 00:04:03,972
Master.

48
00:04:04,092 --> 00:04:04,812
Master.

49
00:04:04,812 --> 00:04:05,571
Master,

50
00:04:05,571 --> 00:04:06,051
are you alright?

51
00:04:30,252 --> 00:04:31,331
Master Sikong.

52
00:04:31,411 --> 00:04:32,571
Take Master He back

53
00:04:32,571 --> 00:04:33,692
to heal his injuries immediately.

54
00:05:04,372 --> 00:05:05,132
Alright,

55
00:05:08,091 --> 00:05:09,932
my time's about up.

56
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:11,571
You stubborn old man,

57
00:05:11,732 --> 00:05:12,971
still making jokes.

58
00:05:13,932 --> 00:05:15,571
I'm waiting for you to get better

59
00:05:16,011 --> 00:05:18,052
and compete with me
for the world's number one.

60
00:05:23,091 --> 00:05:25,052
From now on,
the world's number one will be you.

61
00:05:27,011 --> 00:05:28,732
It's up to you to protect the Xia Clan.

62
00:05:29,052 --> 00:05:29,971
Master He,

63
00:05:30,052 --> 00:05:31,211
let's try again.

64
00:05:36,451 --> 00:05:37,971
I know

65
00:05:39,692 --> 00:05:40,932
my body best.

66
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:45,052
Just let me go peacefully.

67
00:05:56,052 --> 00:05:57,052
Master.

68
00:06:08,732 --> 00:06:09,612
Master.

69
00:06:10,252 --> 00:06:11,771
Can you leave us two alone

70
00:06:11,971 --> 00:06:13,331
for a while?

71
00:06:15,732 --> 00:06:17,011
Let's leave.

72
00:06:39,771 --> 00:06:40,571
Master,

73
00:06:41,132 --> 00:06:41,692
I...

74
00:06:42,252 --> 00:06:43,612
I haven't even started learning

75
00:06:43,612 --> 00:06:44,692
your special skills yet.

76
00:06:45,292 --> 00:06:46,331
How can you...?

77
00:06:46,612 --> 00:06:47,771
Don't cry.

78
00:06:50,732 --> 00:06:52,011
I can guide you at first,

79
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:53,292
but you have to
put in the grind yourself.

80
00:06:53,531 --> 00:06:54,651
From now on,

81
00:06:55,852 --> 00:06:57,052
you'll have to

82
00:06:57,531 --> 00:06:58,771
walk your path alone.

83
00:07:00,891 --> 00:07:02,411
You've got real promise,

84
00:07:04,172 --> 00:07:06,011
but you should
have confidence in yourself.

85
00:07:06,411 --> 00:07:07,052
Yes.

86
00:07:09,411 --> 00:07:10,771
I will always remember

87
00:07:11,091 --> 00:07:12,372
what you have said.

88
00:07:14,132 --> 00:07:16,211
I have a request for you.

89
00:07:17,771 --> 00:07:18,651
In the past,

90
00:07:21,252 --> 00:07:22,692
I had a disciple

91
00:07:24,732 --> 00:07:26,372
who also made me worry a lot.

92
00:07:45,292 --> 00:07:46,692
You're progressing quite fast.

93
00:07:46,852 --> 00:07:47,612
Of course.

94
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:49,451
You know who my master is?

95
00:07:49,812 --> 00:07:51,132
That's the world's number one,

96
00:07:51,132 --> 00:07:52,132
Master He.

97
00:07:52,651 --> 00:07:54,292
When you're too old to fight,

98
00:07:54,451 --> 00:07:56,011
I'll take over your position.

99
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,852
When you become Transcendent,

100
00:07:58,411 --> 00:08:00,252
I'll recommend you to the Xinhuo Palace

101
00:08:00,571 --> 00:08:02,372
to become a candidate for the master

102
00:08:02,372 --> 00:08:03,292
of the Black White Deity Mountain.

103
00:08:04,172 --> 00:08:05,052
You

104
00:08:07,651 --> 00:08:08,812
don't disappoint me.

105
00:08:10,492 --> 00:08:11,571
Master, don't worry.

106
00:08:12,011 --> 00:08:13,052
I'll definitely do better

107
00:08:13,411 --> 00:08:15,411
as a master than you.

108
00:08:36,572 --> 00:08:37,691
Master He,

109
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:38,612
once I kill you,

110
00:08:38,771 --> 00:08:40,252
I'll be the world's number one.

111
00:08:40,332 --> 00:08:41,931
If you want to be
the world's number one,

112
00:08:42,011 --> 00:08:43,332
compete openly and fairly.

113
00:08:43,651 --> 00:08:45,651
Sneaking an attack from behind
isn't what an honorable man should do.

114
00:08:45,691 --> 00:08:46,531
Save your breath.

115
00:08:46,732 --> 00:08:47,651
I'll take your life!

116
00:08:49,972 --> 00:08:51,531
You won't hurt my master.

117
00:09:06,452 --> 00:09:07,372
Demonic technique!

118
00:09:08,171 --> 00:09:09,852
The Black White Deity Mountain,
a prestigious sect,

119
00:09:09,931 --> 00:09:11,492
actually has a disciple
using demonic techniques!

120
00:09:12,252 --> 00:09:14,011
No wonder you're the world's number one.

121
00:09:14,732 --> 00:09:15,771
Once it spreads out,

122
00:09:16,092 --> 00:09:17,132
I'll make it hard for you

123
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,332
to gain a foothold

124
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:19,572
in the orthodox sects.

125
00:09:24,732 --> 00:09:25,492
Tell me.

126
00:09:27,132 --> 00:09:28,771
Why did you secretly
practice demonic techniques?

127
00:09:32,531 --> 00:09:33,492
I just

128
00:09:33,572 --> 00:09:34,332
accidentally

129
00:09:34,531 --> 00:09:35,492
saw a manual

130
00:09:35,492 --> 00:09:37,171
in the secret chamber of the library.

131
00:09:37,651 --> 00:09:39,212
I tried practicing it.

132
00:09:39,492 --> 00:09:41,011
And my skills greatly increased.

133
00:09:41,811 --> 00:09:43,691
I wanted to make you proud,

134
00:09:44,572 --> 00:09:45,852
so I practiced it in secret.

135
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,252
The chamber of the library
is a top-secret place.

136
00:09:48,732 --> 00:09:50,931
Anyone who breaks in will be punished.

137
00:09:51,092 --> 00:09:52,492
You not only read a manual
in it without my permission

138
00:09:52,492 --> 00:09:53,931
but also practiced demonic techniques.

139
00:09:53,931 --> 00:09:55,332
I won't practice it anymore.

140
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:57,531
I know I was wrong, Master.

141
00:09:57,531 --> 00:09:59,492
I won't do it again, never again.

142
00:09:59,612 --> 00:10:00,612
Once you practice demonic techniques,

143
00:10:01,011 --> 00:10:01,811
you can no longer advance further

144
00:10:01,811 --> 00:10:02,852
in righteous cultivation.

145
00:10:03,212 --> 00:10:04,051
Even if you continue to practice

146
00:10:04,051 --> 00:10:05,291
our sect's skills,

147
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:06,771
it won't help.

148
00:10:07,212 --> 00:10:08,171
Master,

149
00:10:09,452 --> 00:10:10,891
don't give up on me.

150
00:10:11,332 --> 00:10:12,612
Please help me.

151
00:10:14,132 --> 00:10:14,811
Please...

152
00:10:23,252 --> 00:10:24,212
You have to leave.

153
00:10:25,651 --> 00:10:26,931
From now on, our sect

154
00:10:26,931 --> 00:10:28,291
has nothing to do with you anymore.

155
00:10:28,811 --> 00:10:30,492
I don't have a disciple
like you anymore.

156
00:10:31,011 --> 00:10:31,732
No,

157
00:10:32,051 --> 00:10:32,972
Master,

158
00:10:33,171 --> 00:10:34,531
don't drive me away.

159
00:10:35,171 --> 00:10:35,891
Leave.

160
00:10:36,212 --> 00:10:37,171
Master,

161
00:10:37,771 --> 00:10:39,492
I just want
to be the best martial artist

162
00:10:39,492 --> 00:10:41,531
in the world like you.

163
00:10:41,691 --> 00:10:43,011
Please believe me.

164
00:10:43,612 --> 00:10:44,732
I can definitely become

165
00:10:44,732 --> 00:10:45,891
the strongest person.

166
00:10:46,011 --> 00:10:47,171
Wanting to be the world's number one

167
00:10:47,452 --> 00:10:48,852
doesn't mean
you can resort to any means.

168
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,051
Your secret practice
of demonic techniques

169
00:10:51,171 --> 00:10:52,651
disgraces our sect.

170
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:53,691
Someone!

171
00:10:54,492 --> 00:10:55,771
Drive him out.

172
00:10:56,051 --> 00:10:57,011
Never

173
00:10:57,252 --> 00:10:59,732
allow him to step into
Black White Deity Mountain again.

174
00:11:01,931 --> 00:11:02,811
No, Master.

175
00:11:02,811 --> 00:11:03,531
Get out.

176
00:11:03,972 --> 00:11:05,092
Master,

177
00:11:06,531 --> 00:11:07,972
Master,

178
00:11:08,372 --> 00:11:09,852
Master,

179
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:11,972
Master,

180
00:11:11,972 --> 00:11:13,972
how can you be so cruel, Master?

181
00:11:14,092 --> 00:11:16,212
Master!

182
00:11:18,771 --> 00:11:19,972
10 years ago,

183
00:11:20,092 --> 00:11:21,612
he risked his life to save me,

184
00:11:21,691 --> 00:11:22,852
but I ruthlessly drove him

185
00:11:22,852 --> 00:11:24,372
out of the Black White Deity Mountain.

186
00:11:24,732 --> 00:11:25,852
If it hadn't been for me,

187
00:11:27,612 --> 00:11:28,612
he might not have fallen

188
00:11:28,612 --> 00:11:30,452
into the demonic path today.

189
00:11:31,332 --> 00:11:32,852
I never thought you, Master,

190
00:11:33,612 --> 00:11:34,492
and Moyang Chen had

191
00:11:34,492 --> 00:11:35,771
such a story.

192
00:11:36,092 --> 00:11:37,612
Please do me a favor.

193
00:11:39,771 --> 00:11:41,212
If you see him,

194
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:44,852
tell him

195
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,811
it's been haunting me.

196
00:11:47,931 --> 00:11:48,612
Master.

197
00:11:48,852 --> 00:11:50,732
Let him not stray further
down the wrong path.

198
00:11:51,171 --> 00:11:52,891
Even if he becomes an ordinary person,

199
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:53,931
don't

200
00:11:54,651 --> 00:11:56,612
force himself into a situation

201
00:11:57,291 --> 00:11:58,452
from which he can never recover.

202
00:12:00,651 --> 00:12:01,372
Master.

203
00:12:09,811 --> 00:12:11,132
Master, rest assured.

204
00:12:11,771 --> 00:12:12,891
I will definitely fulfill

205
00:12:12,891 --> 00:12:14,051
your entrustment.

206
00:12:14,972 --> 00:12:16,212
In this world,

207
00:12:17,852 --> 00:12:19,252
that's exactly the case.

208
00:12:22,132 --> 00:12:23,492
Ordinary people

209
00:12:24,531 --> 00:12:26,531
want to be the world's number one,

210
00:12:29,572 --> 00:12:31,252
but the world's number one

211
00:12:33,332 --> 00:12:36,132
just wants to live an ordinary life.

212
00:12:38,732 --> 00:12:39,771
Tell him

213
00:12:41,011 --> 00:12:42,252
if he

214
00:12:44,852 --> 00:12:46,691
can find his way back,

215
00:12:48,931 --> 00:12:50,092
then I

216
00:12:52,051 --> 00:12:53,891
will still be his master.

217
00:13:04,572 --> 00:13:05,252
Master.

218
00:13:05,492 --> 00:13:06,171
Master.

219
00:13:15,651 --> 00:13:16,931
Master.

220
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:19,092
Master.

221
00:13:21,931 --> 00:13:23,332
Master.

222
00:13:31,051 --> 00:13:31,651
Master.

223
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:36,651
Master.

224
00:14:11,135 --> 00:14:13,579
(Elders' Hall)

225
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:20,411
Yu Jingqiu,

226
00:14:20,771 --> 00:14:22,931
the Snowflake Mark is indeed on her.

227
00:14:23,132 --> 00:14:24,011
Back then,

228
00:14:24,092 --> 00:14:26,212
they separated my spirit from my flesh

229
00:14:26,291 --> 00:14:27,291
and sealed my body

230
00:14:27,291 --> 00:14:28,732
with a bronze coffin.

231
00:14:28,732 --> 00:14:29,771
At the same time, they destroyed

232
00:14:29,771 --> 00:14:31,811
the Snowflake Mark
that could open the bronze coffin.

233
00:14:32,051 --> 00:14:33,212
Unexpectedly,

234
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:35,092
the Snowflake Mark wasn't destroyed.

235
00:14:35,092 --> 00:14:38,212
It's fate that I should return.

236
00:14:38,651 --> 00:14:40,492
The bronze coffin seal

237
00:14:40,931 --> 00:14:43,492
is connected to the lives
of the six Elders.

238
00:14:43,852 --> 00:14:45,252
Only by killing them all

239
00:14:45,531 --> 00:14:46,771
can the seal be lifted.

240
00:14:47,092 --> 00:14:47,972
And now,

241
00:14:48,132 --> 00:14:49,811
the Snowflake Mark
has reappeared in the world.

242
00:14:49,931 --> 00:14:50,771
All we have to do is get

243
00:14:50,771 --> 00:14:52,411
the Snowflake Mark
from within Yu Jingqiu,

244
00:14:52,811 --> 00:14:54,291
and we can lift the seal.

245
00:14:54,931 --> 00:14:56,212
You're right.

246
00:14:56,291 --> 00:14:57,252
Master, rest assured.

247
00:14:57,651 --> 00:14:59,132
I will find a way

248
00:14:59,372 --> 00:15:00,612
to get the Snowflake Mark

249
00:15:00,612 --> 00:15:01,531
from within Yu Jingqiu

250
00:15:01,931 --> 00:15:03,452
and let the Great Demon God's body

251
00:15:03,811 --> 00:15:05,332
reappear in the world.

252
00:15:05,492 --> 00:15:06,572
Good.

253
00:15:52,332 --> 00:15:54,531
When Hero Shan was seriously injured,

254
00:15:54,531 --> 00:15:55,771
he told me

255
00:15:56,132 --> 00:15:57,212
the Great Demon God

256
00:15:57,212 --> 00:15:58,972
was not completely killed.

257
00:15:59,212 --> 00:16:00,691
The Great Demon God did not die?

258
00:16:02,852 --> 00:16:04,411
Back then, the Great Demon God

259
00:16:04,411 --> 00:16:06,852
was hunted down by the righteous
and the gods of the Divine Realm.

260
00:16:07,051 --> 00:16:08,771
He knew he was no match for them,

261
00:16:09,411 --> 00:16:10,212
so

262
00:16:10,291 --> 00:16:11,852
he escaped

263
00:16:12,411 --> 00:16:13,291
with a piece of his broken body.

264
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,572
Where is the broken body?

265
00:16:14,931 --> 00:16:16,051
The broken piece

266
00:16:16,051 --> 00:16:17,051
carries the remaining demonic power

267
00:16:17,051 --> 00:16:18,011
of the Great Demon God

268
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:18,771
and has entered the body

269
00:16:18,771 --> 00:16:20,612
of a martial artist from the Xia Clan

270
00:16:21,372 --> 00:16:23,051
and gradually controlled him.

271
00:16:23,492 --> 00:16:24,891
Ms. Ye, you say so,

272
00:16:24,931 --> 00:16:26,212
but is there any evidence?

273
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,132
And

274
00:16:27,852 --> 00:16:28,411
why do you

275
00:16:28,411 --> 00:16:29,572
know so much about it?

276
00:16:31,531 --> 00:16:32,852
Because it was the person

277
00:16:33,771 --> 00:16:35,171
who, step by step, schemed

278
00:16:35,332 --> 00:16:37,132
to kill Hero Shan.

279
00:16:38,891 --> 00:16:40,612
I must avenge him.

280
00:16:41,132 --> 00:16:43,372
You're saying this now.

281
00:16:43,651 --> 00:16:44,931
So do you already have

282
00:16:44,931 --> 00:16:46,252
a suspect?

283
00:16:46,852 --> 00:16:47,651
Yes.

284
00:16:48,132 --> 00:16:49,411
Because this person

285
00:16:49,651 --> 00:16:51,372
is among us.

286
00:17:04,931 --> 00:17:06,651
You want to protect
the Demon Clan's spy?

287
00:17:06,731 --> 00:17:07,931
Do you have any evidence?

288
00:17:09,532 --> 00:17:10,572
Evidence?

289
00:17:11,691 --> 00:17:13,731
It is on his arm.

290
00:17:15,012 --> 00:17:16,171
Under the guise of recruiting disciples,

291
00:17:16,171 --> 00:17:17,491
I asked Kong Youyue to investigate.

292
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:18,731
At that time,

293
00:17:18,731 --> 00:17:20,211
the demonic mark on his arm was faint,

294
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:21,651
and I couldn't be completely sure.

295
00:17:22,132 --> 00:17:23,292
Today is the Winter Solstice,

296
00:17:23,411 --> 00:17:24,532
the coldest day,

297
00:17:24,852 --> 00:17:26,891
and also the day
when demonic energy is at its peak.

298
00:17:27,332 --> 00:17:28,971
He is definitely unable to conceal it.

299
00:17:29,491 --> 00:17:30,572
Sikong Yang,

300
00:17:31,132 --> 00:17:32,891
dare you reveal your arm

301
00:17:33,012 --> 00:17:34,171
for everyone to see?

302
00:17:42,852 --> 00:17:44,411
If that's the case,

303
00:17:44,612 --> 00:17:45,532
I'm sorry.

304
00:17:47,772 --> 00:17:49,211
Both of you, calm down.

305
00:18:01,092 --> 00:18:02,092
Sikong Yang,

306
00:18:02,372 --> 00:18:03,691
what else do you have to say?

307
00:18:04,691 --> 00:18:05,372
Master,

308
00:18:06,292 --> 00:18:07,372
say something.

309
00:18:08,132 --> 00:18:09,251
Did you get the mark

310
00:18:09,651 --> 00:18:10,532
on your arm

311
00:18:10,572 --> 00:18:12,012
when you were treating
Master Bai's injury before?

312
00:18:12,931 --> 00:18:13,731
Master.

313
00:18:14,211 --> 00:18:15,012
Dongbo Xueying,

314
00:18:15,211 --> 00:18:16,332
what nonsense are you talking about?

315
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:17,971
His arm emits demonic energy,

316
00:18:17,971 --> 00:18:19,052
which is ironclad evidence.

317
00:18:39,411 --> 00:18:40,612
You're finally awake.

318
00:18:44,491 --> 00:18:46,292
Eat this Spirit-restoring Soup.

319
00:18:48,812 --> 00:18:50,891
Your divine bloodline has just awakened

320
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:52,132
and is still unstable.

321
00:18:52,372 --> 00:18:53,971
You suddenly fainted like this.

322
00:18:54,092 --> 00:18:55,532
You almost scared me to death.

323
00:18:56,612 --> 00:18:58,411
Mrs. Xue, don't worry.

324
00:18:58,491 --> 00:19:00,012
Haven't I woken up now?

325
00:19:02,211 --> 00:19:03,092
Master,

326
00:19:03,451 --> 00:19:05,411
it's not easy
to awaken your divine bloodline.

327
00:19:05,931 --> 00:19:06,971
We've waited so long.

328
00:19:06,971 --> 00:19:08,251
Finally, the moment has come.

329
00:19:08,332 --> 00:19:10,132
We can return to the Heavenly Palace.

330
00:19:10,372 --> 00:19:11,691
But why did my divine bloodline

331
00:19:11,812 --> 00:19:13,372
suddenly awaken?

332
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,532
I only remember at the time,

333
00:19:15,532 --> 00:19:16,731
I had difficulty breathing

334
00:19:16,731 --> 00:19:18,411
and felt drowsy

335
00:19:18,411 --> 00:19:19,451
and very uncomfortable.

336
00:19:19,772 --> 00:19:21,012
We found

337
00:19:21,012 --> 00:19:22,332
a divided Demonic Soul Pill
in your body.

338
00:19:22,532 --> 00:19:23,372
Perhaps the effect

339
00:19:23,372 --> 00:19:24,691
of the Demonic Soul Pill

340
00:19:24,852 --> 00:19:26,812
stimulated the awakening
of your divine bloodline.

341
00:19:27,211 --> 00:19:28,812
Seems that someone is more eager than us

342
00:19:28,812 --> 00:19:30,052
to see your divine bloodline awaken.

343
00:19:30,292 --> 00:19:31,451
Demonic Soul Pill?

344
00:19:32,292 --> 00:19:33,852
But the people
I've come into contact with

345
00:19:33,971 --> 00:19:35,612
are all righteous people
of the Xia Clan.

346
00:19:35,812 --> 00:19:37,691
There shouldn't be anything
from the Demon Clan.

347
00:19:37,691 --> 00:19:39,132
Perhaps the identity of the righteous

348
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:40,532
is just a mask some people use to hide

349
00:19:40,532 --> 00:19:42,372
their own ugly faces.

350
00:19:43,971 --> 00:19:45,132
I remember

351
00:19:45,931 --> 00:19:47,812
Situ Hong handed it to me.

352
00:19:48,451 --> 00:19:49,171
Jingqiu.

353
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:56,532
Young Master,

354
00:19:56,772 --> 00:19:57,731
are you okay?

355
00:19:58,012 --> 00:19:58,731
Are you feeling unwell

356
00:19:58,731 --> 00:19:59,852
somewhere again?

357
00:20:00,251 --> 00:20:01,251
I'm fine.

358
00:20:01,612 --> 00:20:02,731
Anyway, this is not the world

359
00:20:02,772 --> 00:20:03,691
we belong to.

360
00:20:03,812 --> 00:20:04,731
We must return

361
00:20:04,731 --> 00:20:06,092
to the Heavenly Palace sooner or later.

362
00:20:06,491 --> 00:20:07,651
I've got the Demonic Soul Pill

363
00:20:07,651 --> 00:20:08,852
in your body under control.

364
00:20:08,931 --> 00:20:10,731
It won't have any effect on you.

365
00:20:11,251 --> 00:20:13,251
But now the more difficult problem

366
00:20:15,092 --> 00:20:17,052
is the Snowflake Mark left
inside your body.

367
00:20:17,691 --> 00:20:19,092
Snowflake Mark?

368
00:20:21,251 --> 00:20:23,052
The abnormal snowfall

369
00:20:23,132 --> 00:20:24,372
was caused

370
00:20:24,372 --> 00:20:25,251
by the Snowflake Mark.

371
00:20:25,772 --> 00:20:26,772
Young Master,

372
00:20:27,372 --> 00:20:28,852
do you still remember
how this Snowflake Mark

373
00:20:28,852 --> 00:20:30,572
entered your body?

374
00:20:38,931 --> 00:20:39,691
No,

375
00:20:40,411 --> 00:20:41,891
I have no impression

376
00:20:41,891 --> 00:20:43,332
of this Snowflake Mark at all.

377
00:20:43,491 --> 00:20:45,411
The Snowflake Mark
has extraordinary energy.

378
00:20:46,731 --> 00:20:48,612
I have no way to resolve it for now.

379
00:20:48,891 --> 00:20:49,651
We can only find

380
00:20:49,651 --> 00:20:50,971
a solution

381
00:20:50,971 --> 00:20:52,372
after we return to the Moxue Empire

382
00:20:52,772 --> 00:20:53,931
and figure out its origin.

383
00:20:56,332 --> 00:20:57,451
No time to lose.

384
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,411
Let's set out tonight.

385
00:21:00,411 --> 00:21:01,572
Leaving so soon?

386
00:21:01,852 --> 00:21:02,971
Young Master,

387
00:21:03,292 --> 00:21:04,812
this time you were almost dead,

388
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:06,292
and I was also frightened.

389
00:21:07,372 --> 00:21:08,171
Anyway, this world is not

390
00:21:08,171 --> 00:21:09,251
where we belong.

391
00:21:09,332 --> 00:21:10,971
We will eventually go back.

392
00:21:11,132 --> 00:21:12,572
We might as well leave earlier.

393
00:21:13,971 --> 00:21:15,012
Mrs. Xue,

394
00:21:15,372 --> 00:21:17,132
isn't it too fast?

395
00:21:17,532 --> 00:21:18,772
At least let me say goodbye

396
00:21:18,772 --> 00:21:19,812
to my friends.

397
00:21:22,651 --> 00:21:23,292
Alright,

398
00:21:25,012 --> 00:21:27,132
I'll give you two more days

399
00:21:27,572 --> 00:21:28,651
to say goodbye

400
00:21:28,651 --> 00:21:29,612
to your friends.

401
00:21:30,411 --> 00:21:32,012
If we leave now,

402
00:21:33,612 --> 00:21:35,092
I'm afraid we won't be coming back.

403
00:21:54,171 --> 00:21:55,292
How's your injury?

404
00:21:57,411 --> 00:21:58,451
I'm fine.

405
00:21:59,012 --> 00:21:59,772
What about you?

406
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:00,651
Me?

407
00:22:00,891 --> 00:22:02,132
I'm fine, too.

408
00:22:02,891 --> 00:22:04,092
I'm worried about you.

409
00:22:04,891 --> 00:22:05,971
If Mrs. Xue knew

410
00:22:05,971 --> 00:22:07,012
I secretly came to see you,

411
00:22:07,572 --> 00:22:08,612
she would definitely beat me.

412
00:22:10,691 --> 00:22:12,251
You're afraid of her scolding?

413
00:22:13,411 --> 00:22:14,411
I'm not afraid.

414
00:22:14,411 --> 00:22:15,372
I'd brave it just to see you.

415
00:22:21,731 --> 00:22:22,372
Take this.

416
00:22:22,731 --> 00:22:23,971
This is the Pacifying Herb.

417
00:22:23,971 --> 00:22:25,491
It can help gather energy
and focus the mind.

418
00:22:25,612 --> 00:22:26,651
This is the Green Blood Dew.

419
00:22:26,891 --> 00:22:28,052
Used for detoxification.

420
00:22:28,052 --> 00:22:29,372
And this Revitalization Pill.

421
00:22:29,372 --> 00:22:30,451
It can enhance your Dou Qi.

422
00:22:30,451 --> 00:22:31,171
Jingqiu,

423
00:22:31,491 --> 00:22:32,292
why are you doing this?

424
00:22:32,491 --> 00:22:33,772
My injury isn't that serious.

425
00:22:34,132 --> 00:22:35,372
Keep them first,

426
00:22:35,451 --> 00:22:36,772
in case you need them later.

427
00:22:36,931 --> 00:22:37,891
Later?

428
00:22:38,092 --> 00:22:39,612
Are you cursing me
with misfortunes and illnesses?

429
00:22:39,731 --> 00:22:41,052
What nonsense are you talking about?

430
00:22:41,132 --> 00:22:41,691
I don't care.

431
00:22:41,852 --> 00:22:43,132
I'll ask you for them
when I'm in need later.

432
00:22:46,292 --> 00:22:47,372
What if

433
00:22:48,971 --> 00:22:50,572
I'm not here later?

434
00:22:55,372 --> 00:22:56,891
Keep them first.

435
00:23:04,971 --> 00:23:06,411
Mrs. Xue said

436
00:23:08,251 --> 00:23:09,411
my divine bloodline

437
00:23:09,411 --> 00:23:10,451
had awakened.

438
00:23:11,572 --> 00:23:13,171
She wants me to return
to the Moxue Empire

439
00:23:13,451 --> 00:23:14,852
to inherit the throne.

440
00:23:24,852 --> 00:23:26,612
The divine bloodline's awakening
is a good thing.

441
00:23:27,251 --> 00:23:28,171
At least you finally know

442
00:23:28,171 --> 00:23:29,451
who your parents are.

443
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:33,651
And I know

444
00:23:35,012 --> 00:23:36,772
I don't belong
to the Dragon Mountain Empire.

445
00:23:38,772 --> 00:23:40,372
If I had known it would be like this,

446
00:23:40,891 --> 00:23:42,332
I would rather not know.

447
00:23:47,332 --> 00:23:48,612
Actually, I understand.

448
00:23:50,772 --> 00:23:51,772
I've known for a long time

449
00:23:52,491 --> 00:23:54,012
that you would leave one day.

450
00:23:55,292 --> 00:23:56,572
But I didn't want to think about it

451
00:23:58,691 --> 00:23:59,812
because it would make me sad.

452
00:24:04,451 --> 00:24:05,292
Xueying,

453
00:24:09,251 --> 00:24:10,411

What's wrong?

Do you remember this?

493
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:03,372
I do. It's so sour.

494
00:27:03,572 --> 00:27:05,171
But if you sprinkle it on the fish,

495
00:27:05,171 --> 00:27:06,772

I still prefer

499
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,931
the burned fish

500
00:27:21,931 --> 00:27:23,132
you grilled last time here.

501
00:27:25,292 --> 00:27:27,052
That taste was different

502
00:27:27,852 --> 00:27:29,372
and one of a kind.

503
00:27:33,012 --> 00:27:34,332
Forget the taste

504
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:35,891
of the burned fish.

505
00:27:36,532 --> 00:27:37,651
How can I forget?

506
00:27:37,891 --> 00:27:39,332
I definitely won't forget.

507
00:27:43,491 --> 00:27:44,411
Xueying,

508
00:27:46,772 --> 00:27:48,012
is this

509
00:27:50,372 --> 00:27:51,772
the last time

510
00:27:51,772 --> 00:27:53,052
I can eat the fish you cook?

511
00:27:55,372 --> 00:27:56,491
How could it be?

512
00:27:56,772 --> 00:27:58,052
We will definitely see each other again.

513
00:27:58,052 --> 00:27:58,612
Right?

514
00:27:59,211 --> 00:28:00,651
If I could,

515
00:28:02,772 --> 00:28:04,332
I wish I could eat

516
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:05,171
the fish you cook
for the rest of my life.

517
00:28:10,332 --> 00:28:11,891
We will definitely see each other again.

518
00:28:12,012 --> 00:28:12,651
Right?

519
00:28:14,132 --> 00:28:14,852
Yes,

520
00:28:16,612 --> 00:28:17,852
I will definitely keep my promise

521
00:28:17,852 --> 00:28:18,772
and come to have your grilled fish.

522
00:28:20,251 --> 00:28:21,532
I will definitely come to see you again.

523
00:28:30,491 --> 00:28:31,171
Don't worry.

524
00:28:32,931 --> 00:28:34,052
I will find a way

525
00:28:34,211 --> 00:28:35,731
to remove the Snowflake Mark
in your body.

526
00:28:37,491 --> 00:28:38,852
What if it can't be removed?

527
00:28:39,532 --> 00:28:40,891
It doesn't matter.

528
00:28:41,691 --> 00:28:43,012
After all, in my eyes,

529
00:28:43,251 --> 00:28:44,612
you are always the most beautiful.

530
00:29:11,292 --> 00:29:12,171
Young Master,

531
00:29:12,372 --> 00:29:13,292
you don't appear the least bit eager

532
00:29:13,292 --> 00:29:14,852
to return to the Heavenly Palace.

533
00:29:16,532 --> 00:29:17,612
Since I was young,

534
00:29:18,491 --> 00:29:20,451
I've practiced martial arts here.

535
00:29:21,132 --> 00:29:22,931
I treated this place as my home.

536
00:29:24,491 --> 00:29:26,411
I never thought that one day,

537
00:29:27,052 --> 00:29:28,491
I would be told

538
00:29:29,372 --> 00:29:30,572
my real home

539
00:29:31,171 --> 00:29:33,052
is in a far-off place.

540
00:29:34,332 --> 00:29:35,292
Young Master,

541
00:29:35,651 --> 00:29:37,092
this is just a temporary bond you have

542
00:29:37,092 --> 00:29:38,292
with the Dragon Mountain Empire.

543
00:29:38,651 --> 00:29:40,651
But it's not where you truly belong.

544
00:29:43,372 --> 00:29:44,292
Belonging?

545
00:29:46,372 --> 00:29:47,491
Ever since I was little,

546
00:29:49,411 --> 00:29:50,731
I felt like

547
00:29:50,731 --> 00:29:52,012
rootless duckweed

548
00:29:52,852 --> 00:29:54,012
with no place to belong,

549
00:29:55,532 --> 00:29:56,731
eager to find

550
00:29:56,731 --> 00:29:58,052
my parents and background.

551
00:29:59,971 --> 00:30:01,572
Now I've found it.

552
00:30:03,132 --> 00:30:04,171
But why don't I have

553
00:30:04,171 --> 00:30:06,052
a strong longing

554
00:30:06,812 --> 00:30:08,651
for the place that will soon accept me?

555
00:30:10,812 --> 00:30:11,812
Mrs. Xue,

556
00:30:13,491 --> 00:30:15,411
am I too cold-blooded?

557
00:30:16,052 --> 00:30:16,971
Young Master,

558
00:30:17,891 --> 00:30:19,971
you've just been away
from the Heavenly Palace for too long.

559
00:30:20,852 --> 00:30:22,092
Once you go back,

560
00:30:22,251 --> 00:30:24,012
you will slowly forget about this place.

561
00:30:26,052 --> 00:30:27,931
(How could I forget this place)

562
00:30:28,292 --> 00:30:30,332
(and everything that happened here?)

563
00:30:31,772 --> 00:30:33,171
The most important thing right now

564
00:30:33,372 --> 00:30:34,812
is to find

565
00:30:34,812 --> 00:30:35,572
a way back.

566
00:30:36,332 --> 00:30:37,691
The Demon Well
that connects the three realms

567
00:30:37,691 --> 00:30:38,971
has been sealed.

568
00:30:40,132 --> 00:30:41,332
Maybe we can ask

569
00:30:41,332 --> 00:30:42,891
Dongbo Xueying for a way.

570
00:30:44,731 --> 00:30:45,572
No.

571
00:30:46,292 --> 00:30:48,132
If the Demon Well is opened for me,

572
00:30:48,372 --> 00:30:50,012
the Demon Clan
will take advantage of it.

573
00:30:50,052 --> 00:30:51,812
Then it will bring disaster
to the Dragon Mountain Empire.

574
00:30:52,052 --> 00:30:53,731
The Xia Clan won't be able to resist.

575
00:30:53,931 --> 00:30:55,132
I can't be

576
00:30:55,132 --> 00:30:56,092
so selfish.

577
00:30:56,332 --> 00:30:57,092
Moreover,

578
00:30:57,691 --> 00:30:58,931
Xueying's injury

579
00:30:58,931 --> 00:30:59,931
hasn't healed yet.

580
00:31:00,211 --> 00:31:01,372
We must not bother him

581
00:31:01,372 --> 00:31:02,211
because of this.

582
00:31:02,292 --> 00:31:03,171
Young Master.

583
00:31:03,171 --> 00:31:04,092
Mrs. Xue,

584
00:31:04,572 --> 00:31:05,332
am I still

585
00:31:05,332 --> 00:31:06,491
the young master of the Moxue Empire?

586
00:31:07,372 --> 00:31:08,532
Yes, Young Master.

587
00:31:08,772 --> 00:31:09,852
Then you listen well.

588
00:31:10,372 --> 00:31:11,572
Don't go to Xueying.

589
00:31:12,852 --> 00:31:13,572
Yes.

590
00:31:15,092 --> 00:31:16,332
Who can't go to me?

591
00:31:17,651 --> 00:31:19,052
It's my young master.

592
00:31:19,052 --> 00:31:20,612
She wanted to see you,

593
00:31:20,852 --> 00:31:21,971
but she was too embarrassed

594
00:31:21,971 --> 00:31:23,052
and didn't allow me to go to you.

595
00:31:23,572 --> 00:31:24,372
If you don't come to me,

596
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:25,731
then let me come to you.

597
00:31:28,411 --> 00:31:29,132
Oh, right.

598
00:31:29,491 --> 00:31:30,491
Where is my Faction Leader?

599
00:31:30,812 --> 00:31:32,411
I haven't seen him these days.

600
00:31:32,852 --> 00:31:34,251
He's been the one looking after me

601
00:31:34,251 --> 00:31:35,731
since I was little
in the Water Daoist Temple.

602
00:31:35,852 --> 00:31:37,491
I should say goodbye to him properly.

603
00:31:38,132 --> 00:31:38,931
He...

604
00:31:46,251 --> 00:31:47,411
He's got injured

605
00:31:47,532 --> 00:31:49,012
and needs to rest for a while.

606
00:31:49,451 --> 00:31:50,772
Is he okay?

607
00:31:50,772 --> 00:31:51,491
Where is he now?

608
00:31:51,491 --> 00:31:52,532
I'll go check on him.

609
00:31:52,852 --> 00:31:53,691
Jingqiu,

610
00:31:54,012 --> 00:31:54,772
you know very well

611
00:31:54,772 --> 00:31:55,731
how strong he is.

612
00:31:55,852 --> 00:31:56,891
Few in the Dragon Mountain Empire

613
00:31:56,891 --> 00:31:58,251
can rival him.

614
00:31:58,451 --> 00:31:59,612
Don't go to see him,

615
00:31:59,931 --> 00:32:00,852
in case you disturb

616
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:01,691
his cultivation progress.

617
00:32:02,251 --> 00:32:03,171
That would be bad.

618
00:32:03,812 --> 00:32:04,852
What do you want to say to him?

619
00:32:04,931 --> 00:32:05,812
I can pass on the message for you.

620
00:32:06,891 --> 00:32:07,852
Actually,

621
00:32:07,852 --> 00:32:09,731
there's nothing special to say.

622
00:32:10,532 --> 00:32:11,931
I just want to tell him

623
00:32:12,012 --> 00:32:13,372
not to put on
a straight face all the time.

624
00:32:13,572 --> 00:32:14,411
He should smile more

625
00:32:14,971 --> 00:32:16,612
and not let everyone think

626
00:32:16,612 --> 00:32:17,572
he's unapproachable

627
00:32:17,572 --> 00:32:18,651
and intimidating.

628
00:32:19,572 --> 00:32:20,372
Also,

629
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,132
tell him not to practice
martial arts at night.

630
00:32:23,731 --> 00:32:25,171
If he has to,

631
00:32:25,372 --> 00:32:27,132
tell him to remember to wear a coat.

632
00:32:27,651 --> 00:32:28,292
By the way,

633
00:32:28,411 --> 00:32:30,092
tell him to drink less.

634
00:32:30,451 --> 00:32:32,532
Actually, I hid

635
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:33,891
his favorite peach blossom wine

636
00:32:33,891 --> 00:32:34,852
before.

637
00:32:35,332 --> 00:32:36,852
It's in the kitchen cellar.

638
00:32:37,572 --> 00:32:38,451
It's unexpected.

639
00:32:38,491 --> 00:32:39,812
You hid your master's wine.

640
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:42,052
That's my foolproof strategy.

641
00:32:42,292 --> 00:32:43,211
But don't tell

642
00:32:43,211 --> 00:32:44,171
him today.

643
00:32:44,612 --> 00:32:46,292
Don't tell him

644
00:32:46,292 --> 00:32:47,332
until he's very happy

645
00:32:47,332 --> 00:32:48,372
or very sad one day.

646
00:32:50,132 --> 00:32:50,691
Okay.

647
00:32:53,572 --> 00:32:54,491
Here it is.

648
00:33:01,931 --> 00:33:02,772
Master Bai,

649
00:33:03,171 --> 00:33:04,211
what brings you here?

650
00:33:04,651 --> 00:33:06,731
Because today,
I'm going to enforce justice.

651
00:33:08,251 --> 00:33:09,092
What does it mean?

652
00:33:09,852 --> 00:33:11,132
You only know

653
00:33:11,251 --> 00:33:13,052
Yu Jingqiu is a deity.

654
00:33:13,411 --> 00:33:14,411
But you don't know

655
00:33:14,572 --> 00:33:16,332
she is actually the trouble.

656
00:33:17,731 --> 00:33:18,852
I'm not a demon,

657
00:33:19,451 --> 00:33:20,372
and I'll never become

658
00:33:20,372 --> 00:33:21,691
the demons' pawn

659
00:33:21,852 --> 00:33:23,411
and harm the Xia Clan.

660
00:33:23,772 --> 00:33:24,731
In your body

661
00:33:25,052 --> 00:33:26,731
is hidden a key

662
00:33:26,731 --> 00:33:28,132
to the evil door of the Demon Clan,

663
00:33:28,451 --> 00:33:29,812
the Snowflake Mark.

664
00:33:38,852 --> 00:33:40,772
I know you don't believe me.

665
00:33:41,292 --> 00:33:42,491
Actually, this secret

666
00:33:43,132 --> 00:33:44,931
has remained hidden
deep within me for over 20 years.

667
00:33:45,372 --> 00:33:46,132
Today,

668
00:33:47,532 --> 00:33:49,572
I can finally reveal it to the world.

669
00:34:25,811 --> 00:34:27,132
Quickly destroy the Snowflake Mark

670
00:34:27,132 --> 00:34:28,012
of the seal.

671
00:34:36,251 --> 00:34:36,892
(Oh, no.)

672
00:34:36,972 --> 00:34:38,532
(The Snowflake Mark isn't destroyed.)

673
00:34:40,492 --> 00:34:41,371
So now,

674
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:42,851
she's the strongest

675
00:34:42,851 --> 00:34:44,331
in the Dragon Mountain Empire.

676
00:34:44,612 --> 00:34:45,331
This battle

677
00:34:45,691 --> 00:34:46,851
is finally over.

678
00:34:47,331 --> 00:34:48,851
We can only say it's a temporary end.

679
00:34:49,412 --> 00:34:50,691
It's not completely over.

680
00:34:50,932 --> 00:34:52,132
Da Er Hao's remaining body

681
00:34:52,132 --> 00:34:53,171
narrowly escaped

682
00:34:53,412 --> 00:34:54,972
and was not completely destroyed.

683
00:34:55,171 --> 00:34:56,532
The bronze coffin

684
00:34:56,532 --> 00:34:57,452
that sealed most of his body

685
00:34:57,492 --> 00:34:59,291
was snatched back
by the Demon Clan to the Dark Abyss.

686
00:34:59,492 --> 00:35:01,092
To prevent them from returning,

687
00:35:01,651 --> 00:35:02,731
Monarch Moxue

688
00:35:03,092 --> 00:35:04,052
even gave his life

689
00:35:04,452 --> 00:35:06,211
to seal the Demon Well.

690
00:35:06,651 --> 00:35:07,691
This time,

691
00:35:07,731 --> 00:35:09,331
we got a deity's help.

692
00:35:09,731 --> 00:35:10,892
What about the next time?

693
00:35:11,132 --> 00:35:12,371
The Demon Well Barrier

694
00:35:12,371 --> 00:35:14,251
will greatly weaken
the power of the gods,

695
00:35:14,612 --> 00:35:15,291
so

696
00:35:15,731 --> 00:35:16,892
they tend to avoid

697
00:35:16,892 --> 00:35:17,851
leaving the Divine Realm.

698
00:35:18,052 --> 00:35:19,331
It was Monarch Moxue and his wife,

699
00:35:19,331 --> 00:35:20,291
the kind and brave couple,

700
00:35:20,572 --> 00:35:21,371
who helped our clan

701
00:35:21,371 --> 00:35:22,452
win the battle.

702
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:24,251
However,

703
00:35:24,972 --> 00:35:26,492
they sacrificed themselves.

704
00:35:26,572 --> 00:35:27,892
We must hold on to

705
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:29,251
the results we've achieved

706
00:35:29,371 --> 00:35:30,612
and protect the Demon Well.

707
00:35:30,811 --> 00:35:32,371
Even if Da Er Hao wants to resurrect,

708
00:35:32,371 --> 00:35:33,851
as long as he can't get his body back,

709
00:35:34,052 --> 00:35:35,452
there's no way to do it.

710
00:35:36,132 --> 00:35:37,851
From now on, our sects

711
00:35:38,092 --> 00:35:39,492
will take turns sending people

712
00:35:40,052 --> 00:35:41,892
to guard the Demon Well in Nanqin.

713
00:35:42,171 --> 00:35:43,612
We must avoid giving the Demon Clan

714
00:35:43,731 --> 00:35:44,892
any opportunities.

715
00:35:44,972 --> 00:35:46,251
Great Demon God Da Er Hao

716
00:35:46,251 --> 00:35:48,171
has already been split in two by us.

717
00:35:48,572 --> 00:35:49,892
What can he do now?

718
00:35:50,171 --> 00:35:51,371
Now the only key to open

719
00:35:51,371 --> 00:35:53,412
the bronze coffin, the Snowflake Mark,

720
00:35:53,412 --> 00:35:54,892
has also been destroyed by us.

721
00:35:55,251 --> 00:35:56,492
A lock without a key

722
00:35:56,691 --> 00:35:57,892
is the safest one.

723
00:35:58,291 --> 00:35:59,572
The bronze coffin

724
00:35:59,691 --> 00:36:00,211
is connected

725
00:36:00,211 --> 00:36:01,492
to the lives

726
00:36:01,492 --> 00:36:02,691
of the six of us.

727
00:36:02,771 --> 00:36:04,612
They can't make any waves.

728
00:36:05,851 --> 00:36:08,092
The Snowflake Mark itself

729
00:36:08,452 --> 00:36:10,612
has its own consciousness.

730
00:36:10,972 --> 00:36:11,492
But

731
00:36:11,572 --> 00:36:12,251
it doesn't have

732
00:36:12,251 --> 00:36:14,092
the ability to discern right from wrong.

733
00:36:14,412 --> 00:36:15,771
It can go anywhere freely

734
00:36:15,932 --> 00:36:17,171
to seek out the strongest person

735
00:36:17,651 --> 00:36:19,412
in spirit power as its master

736
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:20,972
and attach itself to their body.

737
00:36:21,211 --> 00:36:21,892
Since it's already destroyed,

738
00:36:21,892 --> 00:36:23,612
there's no need to worry.

739
00:36:24,291 --> 00:36:25,251
But if

740
00:36:25,452 --> 00:36:27,811
it's attached to the body of a demon.

741
00:36:27,932 --> 00:36:29,211
Then it would be disastrous.

742
00:36:29,211 --> 00:36:30,532
Why are you still worried?

743
00:36:30,532 --> 00:36:31,932
It's already destroyed by us.

744
00:36:31,932 --> 00:36:32,731
Right?

745
00:36:36,452 --> 00:36:36,932
Right.

746
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:38,572
Destroyed.

747
00:36:39,331 --> 00:36:40,092
Unless

748
00:36:40,412 --> 00:36:41,572
all six of us who participated

749
00:36:41,572 --> 00:36:42,651
in the sealing die.

750
00:36:42,811 --> 00:36:43,452
Otherwise,

751
00:36:43,771 --> 00:36:45,492
the Demon Clan
won't be able to open the coffin.

752
00:36:45,691 --> 00:36:46,572
As members of the Xia Clan

753
00:36:46,572 --> 00:36:47,851
and among the strongest,

754
00:36:47,851 --> 00:36:49,731
defending the border
and resisting the demons

755
00:36:49,731 --> 00:36:51,412
is our unshakable duty.

756
00:36:51,412 --> 00:36:53,052
This time, we're risking our lives

757
00:36:53,371 --> 00:36:54,412
to protect the Xia Clan,

758
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:55,612
so to speak.

759
00:36:56,052 --> 00:36:57,171
After the battle,

760
00:36:57,492 --> 00:36:59,251
we'll be more united.

761
00:37:05,651 --> 00:37:06,811
So you didn't destroy

762
00:37:06,811 --> 00:37:08,331
the Snowflake Mark.

763
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:09,972
I let the Snowflake Mark escape

764
00:37:09,972 --> 00:37:11,251
due to negligence back then.

765
00:37:12,251 --> 00:37:13,092
Later,

766
00:37:13,691 --> 00:37:15,211
I've been searching for it.

767
00:37:17,371 --> 00:37:18,572
I'd like to know

768
00:37:18,691 --> 00:37:19,612
the names

769
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,052
of the top cultivators

770
00:37:21,052 --> 00:37:22,132
in Yishui City.

771
00:37:29,452 --> 00:37:30,532
These are the ones.

772
00:37:32,406 --> 00:37:34,734
(Bu Xiaoxi, Moyang Yu, Moyang Chen,
Sikong Yang, Xi Yun...)

773
00:37:40,851 --> 00:37:41,492
Stop right there.

774
00:37:46,371 --> 00:37:47,092
I'm sorry.

775
00:37:48,012 --> 00:37:49,251
Are you crazy?

776
00:37:49,771 --> 00:37:51,092
You're not the person I'm looking for.

777
00:37:51,612 --> 00:37:52,371
I'm sorry.

778
00:37:55,651 --> 00:37:56,932
You mistook me for someone else?

779
00:37:58,811 --> 00:37:59,731
(The Snowflake Mark.)

780
00:37:59,731 --> 00:38:00,492
You attacked me and just left?

781
00:38:00,691 --> 00:38:01,572
(Where on earth did it fly to?)

782
00:38:01,572 --> 00:38:02,612
You're a nutcase!

783
00:38:03,532 --> 00:38:04,851
I've thought about it for a long time.

784
00:38:05,932 --> 00:38:06,972
The fewer people
who know about the Snowflake Mark,

785
00:38:06,972 --> 00:38:08,492
the better.

786
00:38:08,892 --> 00:38:10,452
If it gets out to the world,

787
00:38:11,171 --> 00:38:12,811
it's bound to cause panic.

788
00:38:13,132 --> 00:38:14,412
If the Demon Clan finds out

789
00:38:14,412 --> 00:38:15,052
and gets the Snowflake Mark

790
00:38:15,052 --> 00:38:16,371
before us,

791
00:38:16,892 --> 00:38:18,452
it would be a huge loss.

792
00:38:20,691 --> 00:38:21,731
No wonder
you've been hiding your identity

793
00:38:21,731 --> 00:38:23,171
all these years.

794
00:38:23,532 --> 00:38:24,892
You've been secretly searching

795
00:38:24,892 --> 00:38:26,331
for the host of the Snowflake Mark.

796
00:38:26,771 --> 00:38:28,771
This is a matter
that weighs on my heart.

797
00:38:30,492 --> 00:38:31,691
Based on the Snowflake Mark's nature

798
00:38:31,691 --> 00:38:33,012
to seek the person

799
00:38:33,012 --> 00:38:33,892
with the strongest spirit power,

800
00:38:34,331 --> 00:38:35,651
I've searched
through all the skilled cultivators

801
00:38:35,651 --> 00:38:36,572
in the empire.

802
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:38,012
However,

803
00:38:38,012 --> 00:38:38,612
never have I found

804
00:38:38,612 --> 00:38:39,771
any clues.

805
00:38:40,012 --> 00:38:41,132
I knew that the Snowflake Mark

806
00:38:41,132 --> 00:38:42,171
was in this world,

807
00:38:42,171 --> 00:38:43,452
but I couldn't find it.

808
00:38:43,731 --> 00:38:45,132
Until it appeared

809
00:38:45,132 --> 00:38:46,012
on Yu Jingqiu's body.

810
00:38:46,012 --> 00:38:47,371
I suddenly realized.

811
00:38:48,092 --> 00:38:49,731
She was overlooked

812
00:38:49,892 --> 00:38:51,251
because her divine bloodline was sealed

813
00:38:51,251 --> 00:38:52,171
and she wasn't among the top cultivators

814
00:38:52,651 --> 00:38:54,211
in the empire.

815
00:38:54,452 --> 00:38:55,211
So

816
00:38:55,612 --> 00:38:57,771
the snowfall on Jingqiu

817
00:38:57,972 --> 00:38:59,691
was caused by the Snowflake Mark?

818
00:38:59,691 --> 00:39:00,612
The Snowflake Mark had already

819
00:39:00,612 --> 00:39:01,972
found Jingqiu's divine identity

820
00:39:01,972 --> 00:39:03,932
and her infinite potential

821
00:39:05,412 --> 00:39:06,932
for powerful divine power

822
00:39:06,932 --> 00:39:07,651
before any of us.

823
00:39:07,651 --> 00:39:09,452
That's why it attached itself
to her divine bloodline.

824
00:39:10,092 --> 00:39:12,092
The strange snowfall a few days ago

825
00:39:12,211 --> 00:39:13,651
and the snow on Yu Jingqiu

826
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:15,092
are the strongest evidence.

827
00:39:15,251 --> 00:39:17,251
Since the Snowflake Mark has awakened,

828
00:39:17,572 --> 00:39:18,371
it can choose

829
00:39:18,371 --> 00:39:19,691
its master again.

830
00:39:20,932 --> 00:39:22,972
Now Miss Yu

831
00:39:23,132 --> 00:39:24,651
has strong divine power,

832
00:39:25,251 --> 00:39:26,811
but if one day...

833
00:39:26,811 --> 00:39:27,972
If one day,

834
00:39:28,132 --> 00:39:29,331
someone stronger

835
00:39:29,412 --> 00:39:31,092
than Jingqiu appears,

836
00:39:31,412 --> 00:39:32,412
then the Snowflake Mark

837
00:39:32,532 --> 00:39:34,092
will reside in their body.

838
00:39:35,092 --> 00:39:36,731
If that is a demon,

839
00:39:37,251 --> 00:39:38,012
that means the Demon Clan

840
00:39:38,012 --> 00:39:39,171
will have the Snowflake Mark.

841
00:39:39,291 --> 00:39:40,811
The seal on the bronze coffin

842
00:39:41,291 --> 00:39:42,371
will not be safe,

843
00:39:42,492 --> 00:39:43,731
and the Xia Clan

844
00:39:44,171 --> 00:39:45,171
will be in grave danger.

845
00:39:45,251 --> 00:39:46,651
By that time, it will be too late.

846
00:39:47,171 --> 00:39:49,211
Now that the Snowflake Mark
has just awakened

847
00:39:49,211 --> 00:39:50,291
and is still immature,

848
00:39:50,291 --> 00:39:51,291
still growing

849
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,412
in Yu Jingqiu's body,

850
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,092
it's the best opportunity now.

851
00:39:55,892 --> 00:39:56,691
What do you want to do?

852
00:39:57,211 --> 00:39:58,572
What do I want to do?

853
00:39:59,211 --> 00:40:00,972
I want to destroy the Snowflake Mark

854
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:02,251
inside Yu Jingqiu.

855
00:40:02,492 --> 00:40:04,492
Then the only key to the bronze coffin

856
00:40:04,492 --> 00:40:06,092
will cease to exist.

857
00:40:06,251 --> 00:40:07,452
I should have done it

858
00:40:07,452 --> 00:40:08,612
20 years ago.

859
00:40:08,612 --> 00:40:09,572
No way.

860
00:40:10,052 --> 00:40:11,972
I swore to the heaven

861
00:40:12,532 --> 00:40:14,651
that I would protect and love her
for my entire life.

862
00:40:15,211 --> 00:40:16,731
I'm responsible
for protecting the world.

863
00:40:17,132 --> 00:40:18,092
I am also responsible

864
00:40:18,532 --> 00:40:19,532
for protecting my lover.

865
00:40:19,771 --> 00:40:21,132
But now you can't choose both

866
00:40:21,211 --> 00:40:22,572
your lover and the world

867
00:40:22,572 --> 00:40:23,691
you want to protect.

868
00:40:24,012 --> 00:40:25,972
You're abandoning our empire

869
00:40:26,291 --> 00:40:28,092
and destroying our clan.

870
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:29,211
In broad daylight,

871
00:40:29,452 --> 00:40:30,771
you self-proclaimed righteous people

872
00:40:30,771 --> 00:40:31,932
even resort to killing a single woman

873
00:40:31,932 --> 00:40:33,171
to protect your homeland.

874
00:40:33,371 --> 00:40:34,612
What a joke.

875
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:36,291
Jingqiu

876
00:40:36,291 --> 00:40:36,972
is just like an ordinary citizen

877
00:40:36,972 --> 00:40:38,651
of our empire.

878
00:40:39,052 --> 00:40:40,691
If I can't even protect her,

879
00:40:41,132 --> 00:40:42,892
how can I protect all living beings?

880
00:40:43,412 --> 00:40:44,371
Today,

881
00:40:44,851 --> 00:40:46,291
I'll kill anyone and sweep away

882
00:40:46,612 --> 00:40:48,171
any obstacles in my way.

883
00:40:48,171 --> 00:40:48,892
Move aside.

884
00:40:49,691 --> 00:40:50,371
Go.

885
00:40:55,532 --> 00:40:56,452
What?

886
00:40:56,731 --> 00:40:58,331
Yu Jingqiu is missing?

887
00:40:59,012 --> 00:40:59,572
Yes.

888
00:41:00,371 --> 00:41:01,052
But

889
00:41:01,171 --> 00:41:02,492
she didn't disappear.

890
00:41:02,532 --> 00:41:03,532
She's still here.

891
00:41:03,532 --> 00:41:05,012
Where is she now?

892
00:41:05,052 --> 00:41:06,691
She was taken by Dongbo Xueying.

893
00:41:06,972 --> 00:41:07,731
Dongbo Xueying

894
00:41:07,731 --> 00:41:08,972
won't harm her.

895
00:41:09,092 --> 00:41:10,532
We're lucky this time.

896
00:41:10,691 --> 00:41:11,731
If they really

897
00:41:11,731 --> 00:41:12,932
kill Yu Jingqiu

898
00:41:12,932 --> 00:41:14,492
because of the bronze coffin

899
00:41:14,771 --> 00:41:16,492
and cause our clan's efforts

900
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:17,691
to go in vain,

901
00:41:17,811 --> 00:41:19,371
can you bear
the responsibility for this?

902
00:41:19,771 --> 00:41:21,171
I will never let such things happen

903
00:41:21,171 --> 00:41:22,012
again.

904
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,532
As long as she hasn't returned
to the Moxue Empire,

905
00:41:24,532 --> 00:41:25,771
there's still time.

906
00:41:25,932 --> 00:41:28,211
Now, at any cost,

907
00:41:28,211 --> 00:41:29,811
find Yu Jingqiu

908
00:41:29,811 --> 00:41:31,371
before they do.

909
00:41:31,532 --> 00:41:32,171
- Yes.
- Yes.

910
00:41:34,132 --> 00:41:35,851
(I must catch Yu Jingqiu)

911
00:41:35,851 --> 00:41:37,092
(before him.)

912
00:41:37,211 --> 00:41:38,651
(As High Priest lost the advantage,)

913
00:41:38,771 --> 00:41:39,771
(I am the strongest demon)

914
00:41:39,771 --> 00:41:41,412
(in the Demon Realm instead.)

915
00:42:04,171 --> 00:42:05,052
Jingqiu, sorry.

916
00:42:05,892 --> 00:42:07,251
My power isn't enough

917
00:42:07,412 --> 00:42:09,052
to draw out the Snowflake Mark.

918
00:42:09,412 --> 00:42:10,291
Xueying,

919
00:42:10,532 --> 00:42:11,932
I got you involved.

920
00:42:12,291 --> 00:42:14,171
You've always been respectful
and valued your teachers,

921
00:42:14,331 --> 00:42:15,331
but today, you stand

922
00:42:15,331 --> 00:42:16,412
against the Elders because of me.

923
00:42:16,412 --> 00:42:18,171
I know it must be hard for you.

924
00:42:18,572 --> 00:42:20,171
But I can't let you down.

925
00:42:21,811 --> 00:42:22,691
Don't worry.

926
00:42:23,171 --> 00:42:24,052
Since Master Bai was able to draw out

927
00:42:24,052 --> 00:42:25,492
the Snowflake Mark back then,

928
00:42:25,811 --> 00:42:27,291
there must be another way.

929
00:42:28,771 --> 00:42:30,532
There are many books

930
00:42:30,532 --> 00:42:31,452
in the library of Changfeng Academy,

931
00:42:31,452 --> 00:42:32,651
and they record

932
00:42:32,651 --> 00:42:34,132
many rare martial arts and spells.

933
00:42:34,251 --> 00:42:36,171
I found the introduction

934
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:37,892
to the Black Wind Cliff there before.

935
00:42:38,132 --> 00:42:39,291
But we might not

936
00:42:39,291 --> 00:42:41,171
be able to go back easily.

937
00:42:45,452 --> 00:42:46,771
I know a place

938
00:42:47,132 --> 00:42:48,092
with more books

939
00:42:48,092 --> 00:42:49,452
and rarer ones than the library.

940
00:42:49,691 --> 00:42:51,012
Maybe we can find a way there.

941
00:42:55,722 --> 00:42:58,335
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

942
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:16,572
What if Si An stays up

943
00:43:16,572 --> 00:43:17,932
all night here?

944
00:43:18,492 --> 00:43:19,651
He wouldn't, would he?

945
00:43:19,932 --> 00:43:20,851
Let's wait a bit more.

946
00:43:24,851 --> 00:43:25,452
Oh, right.

947
00:43:25,892 --> 00:43:27,012
I once used the Soporific Sap

948
00:43:27,012 --> 00:43:28,291
on my Faction Leader,

949
00:43:28,291 --> 00:43:29,412
