21
00:02:09,551 --> 00:02:11,831
What's wrong with Xueying?

22
00:02:11,831 --> 00:02:13,271
He fought hard,

23
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:15,792
but the moves
were completely disorganized.

24
00:02:28,431 --> 00:02:29,151
Xueying,

25
00:02:29,151 --> 00:02:29,951
are you alright?

26
00:02:30,111 --> 00:02:30,711
I'm fine.

27
00:02:30,951 --> 00:02:32,072
Just need more practice.

28
00:02:33,192 --> 00:02:34,792
No amount of practice will help now,

29
00:02:35,752 --> 00:02:37,352
because your mind is in chaos.

30
00:02:40,472 --> 00:02:41,072
Xueying,

31
00:02:41,431 --> 00:02:42,111
if there's anything bothering you,

32
00:02:42,111 --> 00:02:43,111
just tell us.

33
00:02:43,111 --> 00:02:44,512
We can figure it out together.

34
00:02:45,151 --> 00:02:46,472
You are making us worried.

35
00:02:50,711 --> 00:02:51,951
If there's a path

36
00:02:52,711 --> 00:02:53,752
that you know

37
00:02:53,752 --> 00:02:54,752
will lead to a dead end,

38
00:02:55,312 --> 00:02:56,111
would you still take it?

39
00:02:56,551 --> 00:02:57,472
No, I wouldn't.

40
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,271
Who would choose such a path?

41
00:02:59,592 --> 00:03:00,711
It'll be stupid.

42
00:03:03,792 --> 00:03:04,472
Yeah.

43
00:03:04,831 --> 00:03:05,551
It'll be stupid.

44
00:03:06,671 --> 00:03:07,271
But if you

45
00:03:07,271 --> 00:03:08,951
don't choose this path,

46
00:03:10,232 --> 00:03:11,991
you might regret it
for the rest of your life, right?

47
00:03:13,472 --> 00:03:14,232
Regret.

48
00:03:14,632 --> 00:03:15,352
You'll regret

49
00:03:15,352 --> 00:03:17,032
not being brave enough back then.

50
00:03:17,671 --> 00:03:18,391
Regret missing

51
00:03:18,391 --> 00:03:19,752
the scenery along the way.

52
00:03:20,232 --> 00:03:21,192
You'll regret

53
00:03:22,032 --> 00:03:23,072
not seizing

54
00:03:23,072 --> 00:03:24,711
that one-in-a-million chance.

55
00:03:27,192 --> 00:03:28,151
Wu Cang,

56
00:03:28,391 --> 00:03:29,752
this is the first time I've heard

57
00:03:29,752 --> 00:03:31,391
you say so much.

58
00:03:33,711 --> 00:03:34,671
The fear

59
00:03:35,032 --> 00:03:36,391
is that once you choose this path,

60
00:03:36,792 --> 00:03:37,711
you'll regret it even more.

61
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:38,792
At that point,

62
00:03:39,072 --> 00:03:40,312
there'll be no way back.

63
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:43,271
Just follow your heart then.

64
00:03:44,551 --> 00:03:46,151
No matter which path you choose,

65
00:03:46,312 --> 00:03:47,431
at least you've tried

66
00:03:47,632 --> 00:03:48,352
and fought for it.

67
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:50,431
Why do you overthink?

68
00:03:59,991 --> 00:04:00,912
Go with your heart.

69
00:04:02,792 --> 00:04:03,352
Wait,

70
00:04:03,551 --> 00:04:05,271
what on earth
are you guys talking about?

71
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,551
I don't understand at all.

72
00:04:06,991 --> 00:04:08,232
It hasn't come to you,

73
00:04:09,232 --> 00:04:10,032
so, of course, you don't understand.

74
00:04:10,472 --> 00:04:11,472
Wu Cang,

75
00:04:12,151 --> 00:04:13,232
who are you looking down on?

76
00:04:14,632 --> 00:04:15,951
Who are you saying doesn't understand?

77
00:04:22,511 --> 00:04:23,232
Wu Cang.

78
00:04:23,712 --> 00:04:24,392
Wu Cang.

79
00:05:04,111 --> 00:05:05,472
You've been thinking for almost a day.

80
00:05:06,472 --> 00:05:07,671
Have you figured out what to do?

81
00:05:09,272 --> 00:05:10,352
If you were me,

82
00:05:11,431 --> 00:05:12,152
would you

83
00:05:12,152 --> 00:05:12,991
make the same choice as I did?

84
00:05:14,311 --> 00:05:15,311
Actually,

85
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:16,631
when you're hesitating

86
00:05:16,631 --> 00:05:18,352
whether to do something or not,

87
00:05:19,311 --> 00:05:20,792
you've already
made a decision in your heart.

88
00:05:24,272 --> 00:05:25,431
Is this comfort?

89
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,592
Do you need comfort?

90
00:05:31,472 --> 00:05:33,912
Give me two catties of source stones.

91
00:05:34,311 --> 00:05:36,991
I have plenty of gold.

92
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,631
Actually, sometimes,

93
00:05:40,792 --> 00:05:42,352
I'm quite envious of that fool.

94
00:05:42,792 --> 00:05:43,952
He's doing quite well like this.

95
00:05:44,712 --> 00:05:46,232
But we don't need to envy him.

96
00:05:46,912 --> 00:05:48,152
Everyone's fate

97
00:05:48,511 --> 00:05:49,912
is something they create themselves.

98
00:05:50,472 --> 00:05:51,832
Have you figured out what to do?

99
00:05:52,511 --> 00:05:53,232
Maybe,

100
00:05:53,912 --> 00:05:55,032
I'll need him.

101
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,232
Senior Xue,

102
00:06:00,232 --> 00:06:02,111
please do me a favor.

103
00:06:02,111 --> 00:06:02,671
I've told you

104
00:06:02,671 --> 00:06:03,871
I don't accept disciples

105
00:06:03,871 --> 00:06:05,232
and I don't have any secret manuals.

106
00:06:05,232 --> 00:06:06,352
How could you not have any?

107
00:06:06,352 --> 00:06:08,032
You're an immortal
who came to the mortal world.

108
00:06:08,032 --> 00:06:10,032
I'm currently ranked low.

109
00:06:10,232 --> 00:06:11,232
If I don't make a breakthrough,

110
00:06:11,232 --> 00:06:12,191
I'm going to

111
00:06:12,191 --> 00:06:13,272
be kicked out of Xinhuo Palace.

112
00:06:13,472 --> 00:06:14,991
Senior Xue, help me just this once.

113
00:06:15,191 --> 00:06:16,352
I'll set up a divine tablet for you

114
00:06:16,352 --> 00:06:17,272
and worship you every day.

115
00:06:17,352 --> 00:06:17,871
I'll pass.

116
00:06:17,871 --> 00:06:19,392
Senior Xue, Senior Xue.

117
00:06:19,472 --> 00:06:20,191
Senior Xue.

118
00:06:20,431 --> 00:06:21,232
Let go of me.

119
00:06:21,551 --> 00:06:22,472
Senior Xue, you...

120
00:06:22,472 --> 00:06:23,792
You kid, what's wrong with you?

121
00:06:23,792 --> 00:06:24,472
Senior Xue.

122
00:06:24,792 --> 00:06:25,631
Let go.

123
00:06:26,071 --> 00:06:26,712
Jingqiu.

124
00:06:28,712 --> 00:06:29,551
Why are you...

125
00:06:29,631 --> 00:06:30,071
Go.

126
00:06:35,152 --> 00:06:36,032
Xueying,

127
00:06:36,431 --> 00:06:37,751
where are you taking me?

128
00:06:37,751 --> 00:06:38,792
You'll know when we get there.

129
00:06:43,832 --> 00:06:44,912
Where is this?

130
00:06:46,071 --> 00:06:47,511
Doesn't it look familiar?

131
00:06:51,991 --> 00:06:53,352
You made all of this?

132
00:06:54,311 --> 00:06:55,511
I was short on time,

133
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:56,191
so there were still a lot of things

134
00:06:56,191 --> 00:06:57,032
I hadn't prepared well.

135
00:06:57,272 --> 00:06:57,871
How about it?

136
00:06:57,991 --> 00:06:58,431
Doesn't it look like

137
00:06:58,431 --> 00:06:59,871
our treehouse under Black Wind Cliff?

138
00:07:01,792 --> 00:07:02,631
It's fine.

139
00:07:02,792 --> 00:07:04,232
Having these is enough.

140
00:07:04,712 --> 00:07:05,912
This is enough.

141
00:07:06,431 --> 00:07:07,631
So aren't the preparations behind

142
00:07:07,631 --> 00:07:08,832
all wasted?

143
00:07:09,232 --> 00:07:09,991
More?

144
00:07:10,272 --> 00:07:10,952
Of course.

145
00:07:15,871 --> 00:07:16,712
Xueying,

146
00:07:17,392 --> 00:07:18,792
why are you suddenly doing this?

147
00:07:18,952 --> 00:07:19,671
It's obvious

148
00:07:19,792 --> 00:07:20,751
I'm trying to please you.

149
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,111
Please me?

150
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:22,991
Of course.

151
00:07:23,152 --> 00:07:23,952
I don't want

152
00:07:23,952 --> 00:07:25,792
when you think of me
back in Moxue Empire,

153
00:07:26,071 --> 00:07:26,511
your mind is filled with

154
00:07:26,511 --> 00:07:28,152
fighting and killing.

155
00:07:28,472 --> 00:07:29,071
I want you

156
00:07:29,392 --> 00:07:30,832
to keep these beautiful memories.

157
00:07:31,511 --> 00:07:32,311
That way,

158
00:07:33,191 --> 00:07:34,352
you won't forget me.

159
00:07:35,631 --> 00:07:37,111
How could I forget you?

160
00:07:37,991 --> 00:07:38,991
I...

161
00:07:39,551 --> 00:07:40,551
I won't go back.

162
00:07:43,071 --> 00:07:44,071
Silly girl,

163
00:07:44,592 --> 00:07:46,431
going home
is something to be happy about.

164
00:07:46,712 --> 00:07:47,592
We should celebrate it.

165
00:07:49,592 --> 00:07:50,751
So, this is the celebration feast

166
00:07:50,751 --> 00:07:52,232
Hero Xueying prepared for me.

167
00:07:52,352 --> 00:07:53,152
Of course,

168
00:07:53,392 --> 00:07:54,472
it's a celebration feast

169
00:07:54,472 --> 00:07:55,152
only for you.

170
00:07:57,352 --> 00:07:57,991
By the way,

171
00:07:58,551 --> 00:08:00,191
with the trap we set this time,

172
00:08:00,191 --> 00:08:02,032
we failed to catch the spy.

173
00:08:02,352 --> 00:08:03,232
Next,

174
00:08:03,232 --> 00:08:04,431
what do you plan to do?

175
00:08:04,671 --> 00:08:06,111
He's in the open and we're in the dark.

176
00:08:06,472 --> 00:08:07,592
It's not easy

177
00:08:08,032 --> 00:08:09,311
to catch him.

178
00:08:10,551 --> 00:08:12,232
There must be other ways.

179
00:08:12,751 --> 00:08:13,952
Let's figure it out together.

180
00:08:16,232 --> 00:08:17,551
I'm just worried about my mother.

181
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:21,071
Have you ever thought

182
00:08:21,392 --> 00:08:22,631
there's another possibility

183
00:08:23,191 --> 00:08:24,311
that your mother

184
00:08:24,311 --> 00:08:25,792
stayed with the Demon Clan voluntarily?

185
00:08:29,111 --> 00:08:29,712
Voluntarily?

186
00:08:29,792 --> 00:08:30,392
Yes.

187
00:08:30,671 --> 00:08:32,911
Your mother has an Ancient Bloodline

188
00:08:33,271 --> 00:08:35,511
and she was once the supreme power
of Dragon Mountain Empire.

189
00:08:35,712 --> 00:08:36,712
In that case,

190
00:08:36,911 --> 00:08:37,791
how could your mother

191
00:08:37,791 --> 00:08:39,072
be controlled by Moyang Chen?

192
00:08:39,352 --> 00:08:40,151
Don't forget

193
00:08:40,472 --> 00:08:42,271
Moyang Chen isn't even Transcendent.

194
00:08:43,751 --> 00:08:44,911
You mean

195
00:08:45,472 --> 00:08:46,631
my mother knew Moyang Chen

196
00:08:46,631 --> 00:08:47,712
was colluding with the Demon Clan,

197
00:08:48,031 --> 00:08:48,751
so

198
00:08:49,192 --> 00:08:50,232
she's been lurking nearby,

199
00:08:50,232 --> 00:08:51,232
looking for an opportunity?

200
00:08:51,871 --> 00:08:53,031
It's very likely.

201
00:08:55,151 --> 00:08:55,952
Yeah,

202
00:08:56,511 --> 00:08:57,751
why didn't I think of that?

203
00:08:58,511 --> 00:08:59,352
You're so smart.

204
00:09:00,151 --> 00:09:01,472
It's not that you didn't think of it.

205
00:09:01,472 --> 00:09:02,911
You were too worried.

206
00:09:04,391 --> 00:09:04,952
Right,

207
00:09:05,192 --> 00:09:06,631
I've prepared a gift for you.

208
00:09:10,352 --> 00:09:11,072
Do you like it?

209
00:09:11,791 --> 00:09:12,432
Don't think

210
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:13,672
it's an ordinary hairpin.

211
00:09:13,751 --> 00:09:14,871
It's a good gadget.

212
00:09:15,072 --> 00:09:15,552
Look.

213
00:09:27,111 --> 00:09:28,192
That's amazing.

214
00:09:28,192 --> 00:09:29,312
How did you make it?

215
00:09:29,312 --> 00:09:31,031
Just knock three times as I did,

216
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:32,111
and I'll sense it

217
00:09:32,232 --> 00:09:33,271
no matter where I am.

218
00:09:35,111 --> 00:09:37,312
Giving such a good thing to me,

219
00:09:37,312 --> 00:09:39,232
isn't it a bit of a waste?

220
00:09:40,151 --> 00:09:41,111
I'm worried about you.

221
00:09:42,511 --> 00:09:43,432
Now that the Demon Clan's spy

222
00:09:43,432 --> 00:09:44,472
hasn't been found,

223
00:09:44,871 --> 00:09:46,151
the Demon Clan will know

224
00:09:46,151 --> 00:09:47,232
about your identity as a goddess soon.

225
00:09:47,791 --> 00:09:48,832
I'm afraid you're in danger.

226
00:09:49,391 --> 00:09:50,072
So,

227
00:09:50,751 --> 00:09:51,712
I hope when you're in danger,

228
00:09:51,712 --> 00:09:52,552
I'll appear immediately.

229
00:09:56,271 --> 00:09:57,192
Xueying,

230
00:09:58,111 --> 00:09:59,712
thank you for everything
you've done for me.

231
00:10:01,712 --> 00:10:03,072
But I feel like I haven't done enough.

232
00:10:11,072 --> 00:10:12,271
It's great to have you.

233
00:10:12,991 --> 00:10:13,832
It's great to have you too.

234
00:10:22,511 --> 00:10:23,871
Didn't you always want to find a master?

235
00:10:24,271 --> 00:10:26,391
Today, I'll let you practice well.

236
00:10:26,952 --> 00:10:27,631
Help! Help!

237
00:10:28,391 --> 00:10:29,352
Help! Help!

238
00:10:31,391 --> 00:10:32,871
If disciples of Xinhuo Palace

239
00:10:32,871 --> 00:10:33,751
have offended you,

240
00:10:33,751 --> 00:10:35,192
please forgive them.

241
00:10:36,432 --> 00:10:38,232
This kid actually dared to deceive me,

242
00:10:38,352 --> 00:10:39,232
letting Dongbo Xueying

243
00:10:39,232 --> 00:10:40,111
take Young Master away

244
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:41,111
right under my nose.

245
00:10:41,391 --> 00:10:42,232
Do you know

246
00:10:42,232 --> 00:10:43,832
she is a goddess of Divine Realm?

247
00:10:44,031 --> 00:10:45,111
How could she absurdly

248
00:10:45,111 --> 00:10:46,151
develop feelings for a human?

249
00:10:46,151 --> 00:10:46,871
Master Sikong,

250
00:10:46,871 --> 00:10:48,031
fortunately, you arrived in time,

251
00:10:48,031 --> 00:10:49,232
or I would be dead.

252
00:10:54,712 --> 00:10:56,511
When I found Jingqiu

253
00:10:56,511 --> 00:10:57,712
at the gate of Water Daoist Temple,

254
00:10:57,712 --> 00:10:58,991
I didn't know she was a goddess.

255
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:01,391
And she has been living
in the human world all along.

256
00:11:01,631 --> 00:11:04,151
Now that you made decisions for her,

257
00:11:04,271 --> 00:11:06,192
isn't it a bit too cruel?

258
00:11:07,832 --> 00:11:09,111
It's not up to you

259
00:11:09,472 --> 00:11:10,911
to teach me what I should do.

260
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:12,072
I know.

261
00:11:13,271 --> 00:11:14,352
You're considering

262
00:11:14,352 --> 00:11:15,312
Jingqiu

263
00:11:15,511 --> 00:11:16,991
and Moxue Empire.

264
00:11:17,472 --> 00:11:18,192
But

265
00:11:18,511 --> 00:11:19,592
have you ever thought

266
00:11:20,391 --> 00:11:22,271
the feelings between Jingqiu and Xueying

267
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:23,871
didn't develop overnight?

268
00:11:24,952 --> 00:11:26,672
They should be given some time.

269
00:11:46,832 --> 00:11:48,031
Why didn't you
mention this method earlier

270
00:11:48,151 --> 00:11:49,552
if you had it?

271
00:11:52,151 --> 00:11:53,911
Since you can find it based on airflow,

272
00:11:54,111 --> 00:11:55,271
why couldn't you find the bronze coffin

273
00:11:55,271 --> 00:11:56,111
in Xueying Territory that day

274
00:11:56,111 --> 00:11:58,312
with the Black White Moon

275
00:11:58,552 --> 00:12:00,952
as the barrier?

276
00:12:01,312 --> 00:12:02,072
Because the airflow

277
00:12:02,072 --> 00:12:03,271
couldn't form at that time.

278
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,111
Moreover,

279
00:12:04,352 --> 00:12:05,952
it was only
after I returned that I could

280
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,631
make the spell to track that airflow.

281
00:12:08,352 --> 00:12:09,751
And you still lost it.

282
00:12:09,871 --> 00:12:10,472
Yes.

283
00:12:11,592 --> 00:12:13,031
I followed it all the way.

284
00:12:45,991 --> 00:12:47,592
It seems that
the Demon Clan had already discovered

285
00:12:47,832 --> 00:12:49,312
the airflow on the bronze coffin.

286
00:12:49,952 --> 00:12:50,991
For so many days,

287
00:12:51,391 --> 00:12:52,472
I've been looking for it,

288
00:12:53,592 --> 00:12:54,631
but with no results.

289
00:12:55,432 --> 00:12:57,192
Are there any other clues?

290
00:12:57,832 --> 00:12:58,712
Not for now.

291
00:12:59,232 --> 00:13:00,312
I'm afraid that by now,

292
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:01,712
the bronze coffin has been transported

293
00:13:01,712 --> 00:13:02,712
back to the Demon God Association.

294
00:13:03,151 --> 00:13:04,072
Qiubai,

295
00:13:04,271 --> 00:13:05,232
how could you let the demons

296
00:13:05,232 --> 00:13:06,712
escape right under your nose?

297
00:13:07,072 --> 00:13:08,232
Now it's missing

298
00:13:08,232 --> 00:13:09,832
and you think of asking us for help?

299
00:13:10,072 --> 00:13:11,631
Otherwise, you would still search alone?

300
00:13:11,911 --> 00:13:12,991
It's my fault.

301
00:13:14,391 --> 00:13:15,072
Ye Mei,

302
00:13:15,312 --> 00:13:16,552
don't be sarcastic.

303
00:13:17,072 --> 00:13:18,352
Just say it.

304
00:13:18,592 --> 00:13:19,552
Say it?

305
00:13:19,552 --> 00:13:20,312
I'm afraid you guys

306
00:13:20,312 --> 00:13:21,592
will lose your faces.

307
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,552
Just for a bronze coffin,

308
00:13:24,712 --> 00:13:25,832
but Tai Shu died,

309
00:13:26,111 --> 00:13:27,631
the Black White Moon was broken,

310
00:13:27,751 --> 00:13:29,511
and Knight Changfeng lost track of it,

311
00:13:29,552 --> 00:13:31,271
even being fooled around.

312
00:13:31,751 --> 00:13:32,271
You.

313
00:13:32,271 --> 00:13:33,111
What do you mean?

314
00:13:33,111 --> 00:13:34,352
Am I wrong?

315
00:13:34,352 --> 00:13:35,111
Alright,

316
00:13:36,031 --> 00:13:37,952
now is not the time for quarreling.

317
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:39,432
With a formidable enemy ahead,

318
00:13:39,871 --> 00:13:41,791
we must first find the bronze coffin

319
00:13:41,791 --> 00:13:42,911
and the Demon God Association.

320
00:13:43,111 --> 00:13:44,911
That's the most important thing now.

321
00:13:45,592 --> 00:13:47,391
Actually, the situation isn't that bad.

322
00:13:47,991 --> 00:13:49,552
As long as we unite,

323
00:13:49,672 --> 00:13:51,552
even if the Demon Clan
takes the coffin back,

324
00:13:51,552 --> 00:13:53,111
it won't have any effect.

325
00:13:53,511 --> 00:13:54,631
During this time,

326
00:13:55,072 --> 00:13:56,712
we must be careful about our own safety.

327
00:13:57,111 --> 00:13:57,791
After all,

328
00:13:58,111 --> 00:14:00,072
this is a major event
for the entire Dragon Mountain Empire.

329
00:14:00,271 --> 00:14:01,592
After all this talk,

330
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,072
are you guys going

331
00:14:03,072 --> 00:14:04,271
to strengthen your own protection?

332
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,232
Alright,

333
00:14:05,432 --> 00:14:06,192
you guys chat.

334
00:14:06,352 --> 00:14:07,352
I'll take my leave.

335
00:14:19,312 --> 00:14:20,592
I want to enter the Xinhuo Palace.

336
00:14:21,312 --> 00:14:22,151
Xueying,

337
00:14:22,631 --> 00:14:23,391
can you go find the Elders

338
00:14:23,391 --> 00:14:24,432
with me?

339
00:14:26,911 --> 00:14:27,592
Entering Xinhuo Palace

340
00:14:27,592 --> 00:14:28,751
is not an easy thing.

341
00:14:29,111 --> 00:14:30,232
With your current cultivation,

342
00:14:30,592 --> 00:14:31,871
I'm afraid
you won't be able to do it for now.

343
00:14:33,871 --> 00:14:35,151
Then what can I do?

344
00:14:35,672 --> 00:14:37,352
I can't enter
the Black White Deity Mountain either.

345
00:14:37,592 --> 00:14:38,832
I want to improve my cultivation

346
00:14:38,911 --> 00:14:39,991
and kill the Demon Clan

347
00:14:40,072 --> 00:14:41,072
to take revenge,

348
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:42,432
but there's no way.

349
00:14:43,151 --> 00:14:43,952
I really can't

350
00:14:43,952 --> 00:14:45,791
just stay here and wait.

351
00:14:45,952 --> 00:14:47,472
I really can't wait any longer.

352
00:14:49,712 --> 00:14:50,391
Jingqiu,

353
00:14:51,911 --> 00:14:52,832
Xueying,

354
00:14:53,472 --> 00:14:55,031
now you are the only ones
who can help me.

355
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:00,432
Alright,

356
00:15:00,832 --> 00:15:01,832
then we can only

357
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,312
talk to Master Sikong

358
00:15:03,312 --> 00:15:03,952
about this matter.

359
00:15:15,911 --> 00:15:16,991
What is it

360
00:15:17,232 --> 00:15:18,631
that you want to tell me alone?

361
00:15:19,672 --> 00:15:20,871
About the bronze coffin,

362
00:15:21,271 --> 00:15:22,511
I have other clues.

363
00:15:23,072 --> 00:15:23,832
What clues?

364
00:15:24,631 --> 00:15:25,631
I used a tracking spell

365
00:15:25,631 --> 00:15:26,672
on the bronze coffin.

366
00:15:27,672 --> 00:15:29,111
The last place it appeared

367
00:15:29,391 --> 00:15:30,511
was at Lu's Fort.

368
00:15:33,991 --> 00:15:34,712
Master,

369
00:15:34,832 --> 00:15:36,352
since we already know
that the bronze coffin

370
00:15:36,352 --> 00:15:37,672
disappeared near the Lu's Fort,

371
00:15:37,672 --> 00:15:38,991
why haven't you
sent people to search for it?

372
00:15:38,991 --> 00:15:40,072
Is it because
there aren't enough fighters?

373
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:40,911
I can help.

374
00:15:41,192 --> 00:15:41,911
Kong Youyue,

375
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:43,552
considering that you just lost

376
00:15:43,552 --> 00:15:44,791
your father and brother,

377
00:15:45,111 --> 00:15:45,712
I won't

378
00:15:45,712 --> 00:15:46,791
take your eavesdropping seriously.

379
00:15:47,791 --> 00:15:49,672
Now, get lost.

380
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:50,832
Master,

381
00:15:51,352 --> 00:15:52,192
you know

382
00:15:52,271 --> 00:15:53,271
my father and brother

383
00:15:53,271 --> 00:15:54,511
were killed by the Demon Clan.

384
00:15:54,911 --> 00:15:56,072
That's even more reason to send me

385
00:15:56,352 --> 00:15:57,952
to avenge my family.

386
00:15:58,391 --> 00:15:59,391
Finding the Demon God Association

387
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:00,952
is the Elders' business.

388
00:16:01,511 --> 00:16:02,911
If you spread what you heard

389
00:16:02,911 --> 00:16:03,991
today,

390
00:16:04,552 --> 00:16:05,432
I will no longer recognize you

391
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:06,391
as my disciple.

392
00:16:12,111 --> 00:16:12,911
Master,

393
00:16:13,672 --> 00:16:15,111
even you won't help me.

394
00:16:21,312 --> 00:16:22,391
Xueying, Jingqiu,

395
00:16:22,751 --> 00:16:23,631
watch her.

396
00:16:24,072 --> 00:16:25,271
Don't let her run around.

397
00:16:25,871 --> 00:16:26,432
Yes.

398
00:16:32,952 --> 00:16:33,552
Youyue.

399
00:16:34,312 --> 00:16:34,832
Youyue,

400
00:16:34,911 --> 00:16:35,511
stop!

401
00:16:36,271 --> 00:16:37,031
Youyue,

402
00:16:37,511 --> 00:16:38,472
you need to calm down.

403
00:16:39,991 --> 00:16:40,791
Calm down?

404
00:16:41,232 --> 00:16:42,552
It wasn't your brother who died.

405
00:16:42,952 --> 00:16:43,871
It wasn't your father who died.

406
00:16:44,072 --> 00:16:45,271
Of course, you can say that.

407
00:16:45,751 --> 00:16:46,592
Kong Youyue.

408
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:51,871
I'm sorry.

409
00:16:52,472 --> 00:16:53,832
I didn't mean that.

410
00:16:54,472 --> 00:16:55,312
I just...

411
00:16:55,552 --> 00:16:56,432
I understand.

412
00:16:56,832 --> 00:16:57,592
I won't blame you.

413
00:16:58,232 --> 00:16:59,111
We will be there for you.

414
00:17:04,952 --> 00:17:05,791
Jingqiu.

415
00:17:19,751 --> 00:17:20,672
Youyue.

416
00:17:21,192 --> 00:17:22,472
Master said there's a plan.

417
00:17:22,472 --> 00:17:23,751
There must be a way.

418
00:17:24,031 --> 00:17:25,392
Let's wait and see, okay?

419
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,351
No.

420
00:17:29,112 --> 00:17:30,311
I can't wait.

421
00:17:30,872 --> 00:17:31,511
If I don't

422
00:17:31,511 --> 00:17:32,551
do something now,

423
00:17:33,392 --> 00:17:34,831
my mind won't be at peace.

424
00:17:35,591 --> 00:17:36,392
I'm sorry.

425
00:17:38,472 --> 00:17:38,952
Youyue,

426
00:17:39,672 --> 00:17:40,632
don't be impulsive.

427
00:17:41,311 --> 00:17:42,232
Xueying,

428
00:17:42,392 --> 00:17:43,192
let me go.

429
00:17:44,071 --> 00:17:45,311
Even if I die,

430
00:17:45,872 --> 00:17:46,672
I must kill

431
00:17:46,672 --> 00:17:47,831
a demon to pay for it.

432
00:17:50,912 --> 00:17:52,031
Awake?

433
00:17:53,351 --> 00:17:55,232
If you're awake, listen carefully.

434
00:17:56,112 --> 00:17:56,991
Wu Cang

435
00:17:56,991 --> 00:17:58,112
is the most powerful student here.

436
00:17:58,591 --> 00:18:00,551
He used heart blood
to lure the Demon Clan,

437
00:18:00,672 --> 00:18:01,831
but he didn't catch any.

438
00:18:02,311 --> 00:18:03,591
What do you think you can catch

439
00:18:04,031 --> 00:18:05,192
just by yourself?

440
00:18:06,311 --> 00:18:07,791
You're overestimating yourself.

441
00:18:13,031 --> 00:18:13,831
Youyue,

442
00:18:15,031 --> 00:18:16,192
come back with me now.

443
00:18:16,551 --> 00:18:17,791
Let's talk about it tomorrow

444
00:18:17,952 --> 00:18:19,192
if there's anything.

445
00:18:29,912 --> 00:18:30,591
Ji Rong.

446
00:18:31,952 --> 00:18:32,831
Master.

447
00:18:33,192 --> 00:18:34,152
Why are you...

448
00:18:37,751 --> 00:18:38,432
I thought

449
00:18:38,432 --> 00:18:39,672
you were used by the Demon Clan,

450
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:40,591
but I didn't know

451
00:18:40,591 --> 00:18:41,991
you were so stubborn.

452
00:18:42,351 --> 00:18:42,952
Today,

453
00:18:43,031 --> 00:18:43,952
I will

454
00:18:43,952 --> 00:18:44,912
teach you a lesson,

455
00:18:45,351 --> 00:18:47,112
so you can learn right from wrong.

456
00:19:11,311 --> 00:19:11,952
Master.

457
00:19:12,232 --> 00:19:12,952
Master.

458
00:19:13,031 --> 00:19:14,112
Master, wake up.

459
00:19:14,672 --> 00:19:15,472
Master.

460
00:19:16,751 --> 00:19:17,472
Master.

461
00:19:18,232 --> 00:19:18,791
Master.

462
00:19:18,912 --> 00:19:20,031
Master, wake up.

463
00:19:20,591 --> 00:19:21,152
Rong,

464
00:19:21,271 --> 00:19:22,192
what happened?

465
00:19:22,952 --> 00:19:23,351
I

466
00:19:24,152 --> 00:19:26,112
just encountered a demon on the road.

467
00:19:26,472 --> 00:19:27,872
In order to protect me,

468
00:19:28,112 --> 00:19:29,472
although Master drove the demon away,

469
00:19:29,712 --> 00:19:31,112
he still got seriously injured.

470
00:19:31,232 --> 00:19:32,551
Don't blame yourself for now.

471
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:34,112
Let's get Master back first.

472
00:19:34,831 --> 00:19:35,472
Uncle Zong,

473
00:19:35,472 --> 00:19:36,511
Master's injury is severe.

474
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,991
Quickly send someone
to Water Daoist Temple

475
00:19:38,112 --> 00:19:39,392
to invite Master Sikong
to come and take a look.

476
00:19:39,392 --> 00:19:39,831
Okay.

477
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:40,831
Let's go.

478
00:19:52,311 --> 00:19:52,952
Rong,

479
00:19:53,351 --> 00:19:54,152
don't be afraid.

480
00:19:55,071 --> 00:19:55,632
Master

481
00:19:55,952 --> 00:19:56,991
will be fine.

482
00:20:02,632 --> 00:20:03,511
Master Sikong,

483
00:20:04,351 --> 00:20:05,192
you're here.

484
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:08,712
Master

485
00:20:08,712 --> 00:20:09,952
was injured by the Demon Clan

486
00:20:09,952 --> 00:20:10,991
and has been in a coma.

487
00:20:11,831 --> 00:20:12,952
You all go back first.

488
00:20:13,112 --> 00:20:13,672
Alright.

489
00:20:14,472 --> 00:20:15,672
Rong, let's go.

490
00:20:16,031 --> 00:20:17,472
Master Sikong is very skilled.

491
00:20:17,712 --> 00:20:18,392
With him here,

492
00:20:18,672 --> 00:20:20,071
Master will definitely be fine.

493
00:20:20,952 --> 00:20:21,551
Let's go.

494
00:20:45,751 --> 00:20:46,472
Youyue,

495
00:20:46,472 --> 00:20:47,432
I made some nourishing soup.

496
00:20:47,432 --> 00:20:48,672
Do you want some?

497
00:20:56,952 --> 00:20:57,511
Oh no.

498
00:20:58,298 --> 00:21:00,058
(Qu Tai City)

499
00:21:19,152 --> 00:21:20,351
With the heart blood,

500
00:21:20,872 --> 00:21:22,031
it should be useful, right?

501
00:21:54,472 --> 00:21:55,791
Father, how come it's you?

502
00:22:00,392 --> 00:22:01,152
Brother.

503
00:22:03,071 --> 00:22:03,912
Kong Hao.

504
00:22:06,031 --> 00:22:06,591
Father.

505
00:22:07,472 --> 00:22:07,991
Father.

506
00:22:07,991 --> 00:22:08,632
It's me.

507
00:22:08,791 --> 00:22:10,591
It's Yue, Father.

508
00:22:10,952 --> 00:22:11,952
Father.

509
00:22:11,952 --> 00:22:14,112
It's Yue, Father.

510
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:16,831
Father, look at me.

511
00:22:17,232 --> 00:22:17,952
Father.

512
00:22:27,672 --> 00:22:28,632
Kong Hao!

513
00:22:29,672 --> 00:22:30,751
He's not your father.

514
00:22:31,432 --> 00:22:31,952
He's already

515
00:22:31,952 --> 00:22:33,112
a demon without consciousness.

516
00:22:54,192 --> 00:22:54,791
Youyue.

517
00:22:54,952 --> 00:22:56,392
Senior Ye, what are you doing?

518
00:22:57,031 --> 00:22:58,271
I'm going to kill her.

519
00:22:58,271 --> 00:22:59,432
I'm going to kill her.

520
00:22:59,432 --> 00:23:00,672
Youyue, calm down.

521
00:23:02,071 --> 00:23:03,791
My father and brother

522
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:05,591
were killed by her.

523
00:23:06,511 --> 00:23:07,912
They're all gone.

524
00:23:08,192 --> 00:23:09,511
Don't be ungrateful.

525
00:23:09,632 --> 00:23:11,271
If it wasn't for my timely intervention,

526
00:23:11,271 --> 00:23:12,672
with your cultivation,

527
00:23:12,991 --> 00:23:14,591
you would have been torn
to pieces by them,

528
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:15,991
becoming a monster
that only eats human flesh

529
00:23:15,991 --> 00:23:16,991
and drinks human blood.

530
00:23:17,071 --> 00:23:18,712
They're not monsters.

531
00:23:22,952 --> 00:23:24,632
They're my father

532
00:23:25,271 --> 00:23:26,712
and my brother.

533
00:23:27,791 --> 00:23:29,232
They're not monsters.

534
00:23:32,591 --> 00:23:33,351
Senior Ye,

535
00:23:34,912 --> 00:23:36,271
Youyue has her own difficulties, too.

536
00:23:36,551 --> 00:23:37,152
Please show...

537
00:23:37,152 --> 00:23:37,791
Enough.

538
00:23:37,991 --> 00:23:38,672
When did you

539
00:23:38,672 --> 00:23:40,071
become so polite?

540
00:23:40,551 --> 00:23:42,112
Take her back to rest now.

541
00:23:43,311 --> 00:23:43,791
Yes.

542
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,376
(Kong Mansion)

543
00:24:10,591 --> 00:24:12,112
How improper you are

544
00:24:12,392 --> 00:24:14,751
if you don't learn cooking and sewing

545
00:24:14,751 --> 00:24:16,472
and do things

546
00:24:16,791 --> 00:24:18,432
that girls should do!

547
00:24:31,957 --> 00:24:33,709
(To Sister)

548
00:24:35,152 --> 00:24:35,672
(Sister,)

549
00:24:36,071 --> 00:24:37,632
(my Crush Spell Seal)

550
00:24:37,632 --> 00:24:38,591
(finally developed.)

551
00:24:39,232 --> 00:24:39,912
(With this,)

552
00:24:40,071 --> 00:24:41,232
(you will definitely win)

553
00:24:41,232 --> 00:24:42,351
(Xueying's heart.)

554
00:24:42,831 --> 00:24:43,511
(As long as)

555
00:24:43,511 --> 00:24:44,712
(you put it on him,)

556
00:24:44,991 --> 00:24:46,751
(I'm sure you will be
the only apple of his eyes.)

557
00:24:48,672 --> 00:24:50,511
(Today is Father's birthday,)

558
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:51,432
(but)

559
00:24:51,432 --> 00:24:52,991
(I also prepared a gift for you.)

560
00:24:53,511 --> 00:24:54,791
(Don't forget to check this surprise)

561
00:24:54,952 --> 00:24:56,952
(when you come back.)

562
00:25:18,952 --> 00:25:19,591
Hao.

563
00:25:21,831 --> 00:25:22,751
(I will definitely)

564
00:25:22,751 --> 00:25:24,392
(take revenge for you and Father.)

565
00:25:40,712 --> 00:25:41,432
Xueying.

566
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:43,311
We can set off now.

567
00:25:44,591 --> 00:25:45,831
I'm not going back to Xinhuo Palace.

568
00:25:46,991 --> 00:25:47,952
Where do you want to go?

569
00:25:49,351 --> 00:25:50,912
I want to join the Bloodshed Tavern.

570
00:25:57,715 --> 00:25:59,512
(Bloodshed Tavern)

571
00:26:01,791 --> 00:26:03,071
I want to worship you as my master.

572
00:26:03,192 --> 00:26:04,432
Please grant my request, Senior.

573
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:07,472
I don't accept disciples.

574
00:26:07,591 --> 00:26:09,591
Bloodshed Tavern only takes assassins.

575
00:26:10,311 --> 00:26:11,392
You should go back.

576
00:26:13,351 --> 00:26:14,672
I have no home anymore.

577
00:26:15,432 --> 00:26:17,112
I just want to follow you and cultivate

578
00:26:18,152 --> 00:26:19,872
to take revenge for my family.

579
00:26:24,551 --> 00:26:25,591
Kong Youyue,

580
00:26:26,112 --> 00:26:27,511
think it through.

581
00:26:27,872 --> 00:26:30,112
Being my disciple,

582
00:26:30,472 --> 00:26:32,271
you must obey me in everything.

583
00:26:33,192 --> 00:26:34,912
I will follow Master's arrangements.

584
00:26:38,351 --> 00:26:41,112
Kill Lengqiong Eight Eagles first.

585
00:26:53,952 --> 00:26:55,591
(With my current strength,)

586
00:26:55,751 --> 00:26:57,591
(is it difficult
to kill Lengqiong Eight Eagles?)

587
00:26:58,031 --> 00:26:58,672
(What exactly does Ye Mei)

588
00:26:58,672 --> 00:27:00,071
(want to do?)

589
00:27:09,712 --> 00:27:10,351
Who are you?

590
00:27:10,392 --> 00:27:11,751
Dare to break into Lengqiong Mountain.

591
00:27:11,751 --> 00:27:12,952
Lengqiong Mountain.

592
00:27:13,071 --> 00:27:14,112
Long time no see.

593
00:27:14,192 --> 00:27:15,152
Lengqiong Mountain

594
00:27:15,152 --> 00:27:15,672
is

595
00:27:15,672 --> 00:27:16,912
Lengqiong Eight Eagles' territory.

596
00:27:17,112 --> 00:27:17,791
To pass it,

597
00:27:17,872 --> 00:27:19,311
you have to pay the toll.

598
00:27:21,071 --> 00:27:23,271
Take a good look at who I am.

599
00:27:24,071 --> 00:27:24,712
Second Brother,

600
00:27:25,311 --> 00:27:26,351
isn't this the girl

601
00:27:26,472 --> 00:27:27,511
who escaped from us

602
00:27:27,511 --> 00:27:28,392
last time?

603
00:27:28,751 --> 00:27:29,511
Our boss

604
00:27:29,591 --> 00:27:30,872
died at her hands.

605
00:27:30,952 --> 00:27:31,591
Brothers.

606
00:27:31,591 --> 00:27:32,672
What are you waiting for?

607
00:27:32,831 --> 00:27:34,392
Kill her,

608
00:27:34,632 --> 00:27:35,751
and sacrifice for the great leader.

609
00:27:35,751 --> 00:27:37,351
Sacrifice for the great leader!

610
00:27:55,591 --> 00:27:56,831
You are unscrupulous,

611
00:27:56,831 --> 00:27:58,311
evil, and cruel.

612
00:27:58,311 --> 00:27:59,831
Living is a waste of air.

613
00:27:59,991 --> 00:28:02,591
Uncle, what's wrong? Uncle.

614
00:28:03,751 --> 00:28:04,912
Let go of that child.

615
00:28:05,192 --> 00:28:05,751
Otherwise,

616
00:28:05,751 --> 00:28:06,912
I won't let you go.

617
00:28:06,912 --> 00:28:08,232
Uncle, what's wrong?

618
00:28:08,271 --> 00:28:10,351
Why did Sister hit you?

619
00:28:10,351 --> 00:28:10,872
She...

620
00:28:11,031 --> 00:28:12,232
She bullied me.

621
00:28:12,392 --> 00:28:13,952
She wants to kill me.

622
00:28:13,952 --> 00:28:15,672
No!

623
00:28:17,311 --> 00:28:17,791
You.

624
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:19,271
What are you going to do?

625
00:28:19,271 --> 00:28:20,551
Don't be afraid, grannies.

626
00:28:20,591 --> 00:28:21,472
I'm not a bad person.

627
00:28:22,232 --> 00:28:24,232
Don't take the life of
our Lengqiong's heroes.

628
00:28:25,152 --> 00:28:26,152
If you want a life, I'll give it to you.

629
00:28:26,152 --> 00:28:28,071
Don't kill our heroes.

630
00:28:28,232 --> 00:28:29,712
They are not bad people.

631
00:28:29,791 --> 00:28:31,392
They took in us,

632
00:28:31,392 --> 00:28:32,912
the elderly and the homeless.

633
00:28:32,912 --> 00:28:34,311
Let us live in the village.

634
00:28:34,311 --> 00:28:35,472
Providing us with food and shelter

635
00:28:35,472 --> 00:28:37,152
and giving us money.

636
00:28:37,232 --> 00:28:38,872
If you kill them all,

637
00:28:38,872 --> 00:28:41,271
you will cut off our livelihood.

638
00:28:41,432 --> 00:28:42,071
Grannies.

639
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:44,311
Please get up.

640
00:28:57,632 --> 00:28:58,831
You've solved it?

641
00:28:59,632 --> 00:29:01,152
I want to be your disciple.

642
00:29:01,311 --> 00:29:02,392
I will obey your orders.

643
00:29:02,392 --> 00:29:03,591
But I don't know

644
00:29:03,751 --> 00:29:04,392
if what you ask me

645
00:29:04,392 --> 00:29:05,232
to do

646
00:29:05,232 --> 00:29:06,632
is right or wrong.

647
00:29:06,791 --> 00:29:07,872
Is right or wrong

648
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:09,672
more important than your master's words?

649
00:29:09,791 --> 00:29:10,392
Of course.

650
00:29:10,872 --> 00:29:12,712
If it's against my conscience,

651
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:13,912
I can't do it.

652
00:29:15,591 --> 00:29:17,232
Can't you do it,

653
00:29:17,232 --> 00:29:18,632
or do you not want to do it?

654
00:29:18,912 --> 00:29:20,232
You are so cold-blooded,

655
00:29:20,311 --> 00:29:21,712
even worse than Lengqiong Eight Eagles.

656
00:29:22,271 --> 00:29:23,432
If you wanted to kill them,

657
00:29:23,591 --> 00:29:25,152
there would be someone
pleading for them.

658
00:29:25,632 --> 00:29:26,991
I don't know if you get caught,

659
00:29:26,991 --> 00:29:28,551
will anyone plead for you?

660
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:33,031
Lengqiong Eight Eagles in the past

661
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:34,311
indeed committed much evil.

662
00:29:34,751 --> 00:29:35,632
But now,

663
00:29:35,632 --> 00:29:37,112
they are robbing the rich
to help the poor.

664
00:29:37,511 --> 00:29:38,271
Do you know

665
00:29:38,271 --> 00:29:38,991
how many elderly and weak,
women and children

666
00:29:38,991 --> 00:29:40,392
they have taken in?

667
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,912
To become my disciple,

668
00:29:44,152 --> 00:29:46,071
you need potential for cultivation

669
00:29:46,071 --> 00:29:48,192
and a pair of sharp eyes.

670
00:29:48,392 --> 00:29:49,551
Just because someone looks pitiful

671
00:29:49,551 --> 00:29:50,511
and says a few words,

672
00:29:50,511 --> 00:29:52,511
you think
Lengqiong Eight Eagles are kind.

673
00:29:53,031 --> 00:29:54,432
What about

674
00:29:54,432 --> 00:29:55,511
the people they have killed

675
00:29:55,712 --> 00:29:57,031
and the blood they have shed?

676
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,751
Back then, when the Demon Clan
invaded our Xia Clan,

677
00:30:02,192 --> 00:30:04,112
they transformed into various forms,

678
00:30:04,472 --> 00:30:05,952
including old people and children.

679
00:30:06,472 --> 00:30:07,311
How many people

680
00:30:07,432 --> 00:30:09,232
died at their hands

681
00:30:09,232 --> 00:30:10,672
due to ignorant kindness and sympathy?

682
00:30:10,991 --> 00:30:11,991
If you don't believe it,

683
00:30:12,232 --> 00:30:13,311
you can ask Sikong Yang,

684
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:15,031
Master He, and those old guys.

685
00:30:16,392 --> 00:30:17,991
If you don't even have the discernment,

686
00:30:18,831 --> 00:30:20,071
how can you avenge your father

687
00:30:20,071 --> 00:30:21,152
and your brother?

688
00:30:28,311 --> 00:30:30,551
I heard you rob the rich
to help the poor, honorable heroes.

689
00:30:30,712 --> 00:30:32,192
I pass by this place.

690
00:30:32,192 --> 00:30:33,232
Please let me go.

691
00:30:33,351 --> 00:30:34,632
When I come back to this place,

692
00:30:34,712 --> 00:30:36,031
I will repay you all.

693
00:30:36,392 --> 00:30:38,311
Leave your things today.

694
00:30:38,392 --> 00:30:39,112
As for you,

695
00:30:39,432 --> 00:30:41,031
no need to go.

696
00:30:41,112 --> 00:30:42,271
We, Lengqiong Eight Eagles,

697
00:30:42,271 --> 00:30:44,271
are good guys.

698
00:30:44,632 --> 00:30:45,952
Right, brothers?

699
00:30:45,952 --> 00:30:47,071
Yes.

700
00:30:47,351 --> 00:30:48,071
Second Brother,

701
00:30:48,311 --> 00:30:49,232
we took the belongings,

702
00:30:49,311 --> 00:30:50,472
killed their leader,

703
00:30:50,712 --> 00:30:52,511
and left these widows and orphans

704
00:30:52,511 --> 00:30:53,632
to block outsiders

705
00:30:53,712 --> 00:30:54,751
and watch our Lengqiong Mountain.

706
00:30:55,791 --> 00:30:57,432
You really are a good guy.

707
00:30:58,751 --> 00:30:59,712
Take a good look

708
00:31:00,232 --> 00:31:01,271
at who I am.

709
00:31:30,432 --> 00:31:31,551
I have completed

710
00:31:31,551 --> 00:31:32,672
the task you gave me.

711
00:31:35,152 --> 00:31:36,952
Your task is not yet complete.

712
00:31:37,112 --> 00:31:38,031
Next time,

713
00:31:38,511 --> 00:31:39,952
I hope you'll leave

714
00:31:39,952 --> 00:31:41,791
Sikong Yang's arm here.

715
00:31:43,071 --> 00:31:44,712
What mistake did Faction Leader make

716
00:31:44,712 --> 00:31:45,991
that makes you hate him so much?

717
00:31:46,392 --> 00:31:47,872
Since you can't do it,

718
00:31:48,271 --> 00:31:49,392
please go back.

719
00:31:50,511 --> 00:31:51,912
Please be explicit, Senior.

720
00:31:52,271 --> 00:31:54,031
What did Master Sikong do wrong?

721
00:31:54,271 --> 00:31:55,872
Just do it.

722
00:31:57,991 --> 00:31:58,791
Senior Ye,

723
00:31:59,271 --> 00:32:00,232
I don't understand

724
00:32:00,232 --> 00:32:01,432
why you would make such a request.

725
00:32:01,591 --> 00:32:03,031
Please make it clear.

726
00:32:03,912 --> 00:32:05,311
Do it

727
00:32:05,672 --> 00:32:06,952
or go back.

728
00:32:07,071 --> 00:32:08,351
I have nothing to reply to.

729
00:32:09,591 --> 00:32:10,751
If you won't say it,

730
00:32:11,112 --> 00:32:12,152
I will tell

731
00:32:12,152 --> 00:32:12,991
the Elder Council

732
00:32:12,991 --> 00:32:14,271
to have them publicly try this matter.

733
00:32:14,351 --> 00:32:15,831
Dongbo Xueying,

734
00:32:15,872 --> 00:32:17,192
stop acting smart.

735
00:32:17,511 --> 00:32:19,351
It concerns the unity
of the Xia Clan's Elders Council.

736
00:32:19,831 --> 00:32:21,311
If Master Sikong really did something

737
00:32:21,311 --> 00:32:22,392
to harm the Xia Clan,

738
00:32:22,591 --> 00:32:24,112
we will not tolerate it either.

739
00:32:25,831 --> 00:32:27,192
Because this person

740
00:32:27,952 --> 00:32:28,791
is very likely

741
00:32:28,791 --> 00:32:30,551
a spy of the Demon Clan.

742
00:32:33,831 --> 00:32:35,031
This is absolutely impossible.

743
00:32:35,112 --> 00:32:36,672
Why are you slandering Faction Leader?

744
00:32:37,031 --> 00:32:38,071
Back then, when Hero Shan

745
00:32:38,071 --> 00:32:39,551
entered the Dark Abyss,

746
00:32:39,712 --> 00:32:41,591
it was Sikong Yang
who gave the information.

747
00:32:41,952 --> 00:32:43,591
Hero Shan entered the Dark Abyss

748
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:44,872
and never came back.

749
00:32:45,392 --> 00:32:46,271
And at that time,

750
00:32:46,591 --> 00:32:47,872
I had just arrived.

751
00:32:52,872 --> 00:32:53,511
Over these years,

752
00:32:53,511 --> 00:32:55,432
I have been looking for
the remnants of the Demon God.

753
00:32:56,112 --> 00:32:58,392
Now I am very sure

754
00:32:58,791 --> 00:33:00,632
that person is Sikong Yang.

755
00:33:01,112 --> 00:33:02,551
Why are you so sure?

756
00:33:03,392 --> 00:33:04,152
The answer

757
00:33:04,392 --> 00:33:05,872
is on his arm.

758
00:33:06,392 --> 00:33:07,432
As long as you can find

759
00:33:07,432 --> 00:33:09,472
evidence of Sikong Yang
colluding with the Demon Clan,

760
00:33:09,712 --> 00:33:11,232
we can kill him

761
00:33:11,232 --> 00:33:11,991
justifiably.

762
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:13,952
Fine.

763
00:33:13,952 --> 00:33:15,551
I've said enough.

764
00:33:17,031 --> 00:33:18,831
Either you go on your mission

765
00:33:18,912 --> 00:33:20,311
or do as you please.

766
00:33:24,472 --> 00:33:25,472
Faction Leader will never be

767
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:26,392
a spy of the Demon Clan.

768
00:33:26,392 --> 00:33:27,551
She must be mistaken.

769
00:33:27,632 --> 00:33:28,791
Let's go to the Water Daoist Temple

770
00:33:28,952 --> 00:33:29,912
to investigate the truth.

771
00:33:37,432 --> 00:33:39,112
If what Ye Mei says is true,

772
00:33:39,271 --> 00:33:40,791
can you really kill him for justice?

773
00:33:41,031 --> 00:33:41,872
No matter who it is,

774
00:33:41,991 --> 00:33:42,952
if they collude with the Demon Clan,

775
00:33:42,952 --> 00:33:43,872
we will not tolerate it.

776
00:33:44,551 --> 00:33:45,232
Senior Sister,

777
00:33:45,791 --> 00:33:46,872
why did you come back today?

778
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,232
We came to see Faction Leader.

779
00:33:48,672 --> 00:33:49,472
Please come in.

780
00:33:54,432 --> 00:33:55,232
Master Sikong.

781
00:33:56,831 --> 00:33:58,712
Why did you come today?

782
00:33:58,791 --> 00:34:00,791
Faction Leader, I missed you.

783
00:34:04,472 --> 00:34:05,311
Faction Leader,

784
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:06,351
I came today

785
00:34:06,351 --> 00:34:07,991
to ask you a favor.

786
00:34:08,071 --> 00:34:09,992
My divine vein has not awakened,

787
00:34:10,112 --> 00:34:10,951
so I want to see

788
00:34:10,951 --> 00:34:11,632
if you have any way

789
00:34:11,632 --> 00:34:12,512
to help me, Faction Leader.

790
00:34:12,672 --> 00:34:14,751
If it's a Xia Clan cultivator,

791
00:34:14,831 --> 00:34:15,751
I can give some guidance

792
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:17,232
to improve their skills.

793
00:34:18,032 --> 00:34:19,072
As for

794
00:34:19,072 --> 00:34:21,032
the divine vein, I'm afraid...

795
00:34:21,871 --> 00:34:22,871
Faction Leader,

796
00:34:22,871 --> 00:34:24,351
please think of a way.

797
00:34:24,431 --> 00:34:25,232
Today,

798
00:34:25,232 --> 00:34:26,592
I'll cook personally.

799
00:34:26,592 --> 00:34:27,791
Make a table full of delicacies.

800
00:34:27,791 --> 00:34:29,311
While you enjoy the food and drink,

801
00:34:29,311 --> 00:34:30,112
you might think of something

802
00:34:30,112 --> 00:34:31,232
accidentally.

803
00:34:31,592 --> 00:34:33,632
Well, I'll think about it.

804
00:34:34,831 --> 00:34:35,911
I don't know

805
00:34:36,271 --> 00:34:37,512
if they can have it.

806
00:34:38,112 --> 00:34:39,431
Usually, I can't drink much,

807
00:34:39,712 --> 00:34:40,431
but today...

808
00:34:40,751 --> 00:34:42,192
With Jingqiu's side dishes,

809
00:34:42,192 --> 00:34:44,192
we'll enjoy them with Master Sikong.

810
00:34:45,431 --> 00:34:46,112
Alright.

811
00:34:46,431 --> 00:34:47,712
Let's settle it.

812
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:58,911
Will it work for sure?

813
00:35:00,672 --> 00:35:01,351
When I was a kid,

814
00:35:01,351 --> 00:35:02,672
to get Faction Leader to drink less,

815
00:35:02,672 --> 00:35:03,552
I specially asked someone to make it.

816
00:35:03,552 --> 00:35:04,391
Don't worry.

817
00:35:08,311 --> 00:35:08,871
Cheers.

818
00:35:09,152 --> 00:35:10,311
Let's drink.

819
00:35:14,471 --> 00:35:15,072
Faction Leader,

820
00:35:15,431 --> 00:35:17,112
please taste the Wine Chicken I made.

821
00:35:17,512 --> 00:35:19,271
I've tried it.

822
00:35:19,791 --> 00:35:21,152
Our Jingqiu

823
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:23,032
not only has talent in martial arts

824
00:35:23,032 --> 00:35:25,351
but also in cooking.

825
00:35:27,871 --> 00:35:28,791
Master Sikong,

826
00:35:28,911 --> 00:35:29,911
I toast you.

827
00:35:30,512 --> 00:35:31,911
As the Demon Clan is invading,

828
00:35:32,072 --> 00:35:33,471
all major Transcendent organizations

829
00:35:33,471 --> 00:35:34,072
have lowered

830
00:35:34,072 --> 00:35:35,592
their requirements
for accepting disciples,

831
00:35:36,192 --> 00:35:37,192
but

832
00:35:37,192 --> 00:35:38,391
I haven't figured out

833
00:35:38,471 --> 00:35:39,311
which Demigod

834
00:35:39,311 --> 00:35:40,592
to worship yet.

835
00:35:40,831 --> 00:35:42,232
I would like to ask for your guidance.

836
00:35:48,751 --> 00:35:49,712
Actually,

837
00:35:49,712 --> 00:35:51,032
the Inner Sight Technique

838
00:35:51,112 --> 00:35:52,951
is very practical in actual combat.

839
00:35:53,632 --> 00:35:54,791
What you need most is to increase

840
00:35:54,791 --> 00:35:56,351
the attack of your spells.

841
00:35:56,552 --> 00:35:57,471
As for

842
00:35:57,592 --> 00:35:59,232
which organization to join,

843
00:35:59,672 --> 00:36:00,791
everyone knows

844
00:36:01,311 --> 00:36:02,592
my Water Daoist Temple

845
00:36:02,672 --> 00:36:04,431
has the most Transcendent members

846
00:36:04,431 --> 00:36:05,911
and the strongest strength.

847
00:36:05,911 --> 00:36:06,552
But

848
00:36:06,592 --> 00:36:08,391
joining which Transcendent organization

849
00:36:08,391 --> 00:36:10,192
depends entirely on your wishes.

850
00:36:11,871 --> 00:36:14,232
I don't participate in
the competition for disciples.

851
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:15,512
(The old man)

852
00:36:15,992 --> 00:36:16,552
(speaks)

853
00:36:16,552 --> 00:36:17,871
(so righteously on the surface.)

854
00:36:19,152 --> 00:36:20,592
Without Master's guidance,

855
00:36:21,072 --> 00:36:22,471
I wouldn't have joined
the Xinhuo Palace.

856
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:26,152
You

857
00:36:26,911 --> 00:36:28,311
have the most thoughts.

858
00:36:29,072 --> 00:36:30,271
I don't know

859
00:36:30,391 --> 00:36:31,512
why you're so eager to

860
00:36:31,512 --> 00:36:33,032
enter Xinhuo Palace.

861
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:34,592
But you should know

862
00:36:35,112 --> 00:36:37,072
Xinhuo Palace is our Xia Clan's

863
00:36:37,072 --> 00:36:38,951
last line of defense.

864
00:36:39,512 --> 00:36:41,632
Being able to enter
Xinhuo Palace for cultivation

865
00:36:42,112 --> 00:36:43,831
is a rare opportunity.

866
00:36:44,192 --> 00:36:45,512
Since you've entered,

867
00:36:45,632 --> 00:36:47,072
you shall cultivate well

868
00:36:47,471 --> 00:36:48,871
and protect the Xia Clan

869
00:36:49,672 --> 00:36:51,632
with all your mind and effort.

870
00:36:52,112 --> 00:36:52,552
Yes,

871
00:36:52,871 --> 00:36:54,471
I'll obey your teachings.

872
00:36:55,831 --> 00:36:56,391
Come.

873
00:36:57,072 --> 00:36:57,992
Drink up.

874
00:37:13,311 --> 00:37:14,032
Master.

875
00:37:15,232 --> 00:37:16,072
Faction Leader.

876
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:16,831
Master.

877
00:37:16,951 --> 00:37:17,592
It seems

878
00:37:17,592 --> 00:37:18,951
he's really fast asleep.

879
00:37:19,192 --> 00:37:20,791
If there's no trace on his arm,

880
00:37:20,791 --> 00:37:21,592
it means

881
00:37:21,592 --> 00:37:22,992
what she said is all false.

882
00:37:29,271 --> 00:37:29,871
Is there?

883
00:37:31,512 --> 00:37:32,471
I knew

884
00:37:32,592 --> 00:37:34,072
Faction Leader would never
have a connection

885
00:37:34,072 --> 00:37:34,951
with the Demon Clan.

886
00:37:35,311 --> 00:37:36,072
Impossible.

887
00:37:36,351 --> 00:37:37,271
Indeed, there is

888
00:37:37,271 --> 00:37:38,271
no Demon Clan pattern on the arm.

889
00:37:38,471 --> 00:37:39,271
So what?

890
00:37:39,751 --> 00:37:40,552
Don't forget

891
00:37:41,351 --> 00:37:42,431
the people in the Demon Clan

892
00:37:42,632 --> 00:37:43,791
are all extremely cunning

893
00:37:43,951 --> 00:37:45,072
and good at disguising.

894
00:37:45,512 --> 00:37:46,751
Whether there's a problem or not,

895
00:37:47,152 --> 00:37:48,351
take this arm back and check,

896
00:37:48,351 --> 00:37:49,032
you'll know.

897
00:37:49,311 --> 00:37:50,072
Our chance

898
00:37:50,072 --> 00:37:51,112
is just this once.

899
00:37:51,712 --> 00:37:52,791
Youyue, what are you doing?

900
00:37:53,351 --> 00:37:55,072
Calm down, don't make a sound.

901
00:37:55,831 --> 00:37:56,391
Let's go.

902
00:38:01,871 --> 00:38:03,592
Master Ye wouldn't
frame someone casually.

903
00:38:03,592 --> 00:38:04,471
Since she said so,

904
00:38:04,471 --> 00:38:05,592
there must be a reason.

905
00:38:06,032 --> 00:38:06,992
How can you be so sure

906
00:38:06,992 --> 00:38:08,232
that what she said is true?

907
00:38:08,351 --> 00:38:09,791
We know you want to kill the Demon Clan

908
00:38:09,791 --> 00:38:10,751
and are eager for revenge.

909
00:38:10,751 --> 00:38:11,992
But you still need to stay calm.

910
00:38:12,072 --> 00:38:13,311
Don't make a decision you'll regret

911
00:38:13,311 --> 00:38:14,592
in a moment of impulse.

912
00:38:14,751 --> 00:38:16,271
You are their disciples.

913
00:38:16,271 --> 00:38:17,552
Of course, you want to protect him.

914
00:38:17,592 --> 00:38:18,072
For this matter,

915
00:38:18,072 --> 00:38:19,271
I'm afraid there's something strange.

916
00:38:19,672 --> 00:38:21,471
Maybe it's Senior Ye who made a mistake.

917
00:38:21,992 --> 00:38:23,112
Now that we're facing a great enemy,

918
00:38:23,391 --> 00:38:24,672
we shouldn't be fighting like this.

919
00:38:25,391 --> 00:38:25,992
Youyue,

920
00:38:26,431 --> 00:38:28,072
we hate the Demon Clan just like you.

921
00:38:28,592 --> 00:38:29,951
My mother was also taken away
by the Demon Clan.

922
00:38:30,311 --> 00:38:30,951
But before we find out

923
00:38:30,951 --> 00:38:32,192
the truth of the matter,

924
00:38:32,271 --> 00:38:33,232
our hasty actions

925
00:38:33,751 --> 00:38:35,192
will only make us more passive.

926
00:38:36,431 --> 00:38:37,431
We promise you

927
00:38:37,712 --> 00:38:38,831
if Faction Leader really is

928
00:38:38,831 --> 00:38:39,871
a spy of the Demon Clan,

929
00:38:39,992 --> 00:38:40,831
we won't

930
00:38:40,831 --> 00:38:42,391
protect him due to
our master-disciple relationship.

931
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:43,232
Rest assured.

932
00:38:45,431 --> 00:38:46,032
Fine.

933
00:38:46,831 --> 00:38:48,751
But before the matter is clarified,

934
00:38:49,112 --> 00:38:50,751
I'll stay in the Water Daoist Temple

935
00:38:51,311 --> 00:38:52,032
and watch him.

936
00:38:58,032 --> 00:38:58,791
Master,

937
00:38:59,192 --> 00:39:00,512
what's this for?

938
00:39:00,632 --> 00:39:02,232
Extinguish all these candles,

939
00:39:02,471 --> 00:39:03,471
then you can go out.

940
00:39:33,072 --> 00:39:33,791
Master,

941
00:39:34,471 --> 00:39:35,712
there's something wrong
with these candles, right?

942
00:39:50,271 --> 00:39:51,192
No, no, no.

943
00:39:51,351 --> 00:39:52,791
I won't run anymore.
I won't run, Master.

944
00:39:53,032 --> 00:39:54,311
I really can't run anymore.

945
00:39:54,512 --> 00:39:55,951
Can we practice again another day?

946
00:39:55,951 --> 00:39:56,672
Continue.

947
00:39:56,791 --> 00:39:58,632
Master, please, no more.

948
00:39:58,632 --> 00:40:00,112
For those stupid candles you made,

949
00:40:00,112 --> 00:40:00,871
I stepped on them,
and they were off and lit again.

950
00:40:00,871 --> 00:40:01,791
Stepped on them,
and they were off and lit again.

951
00:40:01,791 --> 00:40:02,871
That's so fast.

952
00:40:02,871 --> 00:40:04,192
How could I possibly
make them all off at the same time?

953
00:40:04,192 --> 00:40:05,712
I can't see clearly even now.

954
00:40:05,712 --> 00:40:07,271
Are you running with your eyes?

955
00:40:07,871 --> 00:40:09,112
By the time you see and then run,

956
00:40:09,112 --> 00:40:10,672
enemies will have caught up with you.

957
00:40:11,271 --> 00:40:13,232
Use your steps and your mind.

958
00:40:13,512 --> 00:40:14,512
The mind should be faster
than the brain,

959
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:15,351
the brain faster than the feet,

960
00:40:15,351 --> 00:40:16,471
and the feet faster than the sight.

961
00:40:17,992 --> 00:40:19,512
Do you understand?

962
00:40:19,512 --> 00:40:20,351
I don't understand.

963
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:21,672
The mind should be faster
than the brain,

964
00:40:21,672 --> 00:40:22,672
the brain faster than the feet,

965
00:40:22,672 --> 00:40:24,271
and the feet faster than the sight.

966
00:40:26,391 --> 00:40:27,232
Still don't understand.

967
00:40:28,032 --> 00:40:28,751
Master,

968
00:40:28,871 --> 00:40:29,871
it's time for dinner.

969
00:40:29,871 --> 00:40:30,431
Master,

970
00:40:30,552 --> 00:40:31,192
it's mealtime.

971
00:40:31,192 --> 00:40:32,271
Let's have dinner first,

972
00:40:32,271 --> 00:40:32,592
shall we?

973
00:40:32,592 --> 00:40:33,152
You can have it

974
00:40:33,232 --> 00:40:34,152
once you go out.

975
00:40:34,152 --> 00:40:35,632
Master, don't be like this.

976
00:40:35,632 --> 00:40:36,951
Every time you lock me in here...

977
00:40:38,351 --> 00:40:38,751
Master.

978
00:40:38,951 --> 00:40:39,512
No, Master.

979
00:40:39,632 --> 00:40:40,791
I-I was wrong. I was wrong.

980
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:41,512
I'll practice, alright?

981
00:40:41,592 --> 00:40:42,712
If he keeps practicing like this,

982
00:40:42,712 --> 00:40:44,232
will he have a counterattack?

983
00:40:44,471 --> 00:40:45,391
Let him practice.
