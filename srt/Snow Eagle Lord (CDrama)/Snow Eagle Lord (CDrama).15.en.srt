21
00:01:47,335 --> 00:01:48,296
Great Demon God,

22
00:01:48,856 --> 00:01:50,335
the demons in the Dark Abyss

23
00:01:50,415 --> 00:01:50,936
have found

24
00:01:51,055 --> 00:01:52,216
the new location for the well.

25
00:01:52,296 --> 00:01:53,016
After the lunar eclipse,

26
00:01:53,096 --> 00:01:54,456
the first ray of sunlight

27
00:01:54,816 --> 00:01:56,016
will show us the weakest spot

28
00:01:56,135 --> 00:01:57,775
connecting the three realms.

29
00:01:58,816 --> 00:02:00,736
That's where we can create
the Demon Well.

30
00:02:01,856 --> 00:02:02,615
Well done.

31
00:02:02,895 --> 00:02:04,176
It looks like I'm one step closer

32
00:02:04,296 --> 00:02:05,535
to my comeback.

33
00:02:05,695 --> 00:02:06,615
Where is the new spot

34
00:02:06,695 --> 00:02:07,576
for the well?

35
00:02:07,936 --> 00:02:09,095
At Xueying Territory.

36
00:02:10,296 --> 00:02:11,495
Assemble now.

37
00:02:11,615 --> 00:02:13,655
Head to the Xueying Territory
with the source stones.

38
00:02:13,815 --> 00:02:16,335
The Xia Clan will soon be defeated.

39
00:02:16,495 --> 00:02:17,536
Understood.

40
00:02:17,655 --> 00:02:18,456
Also,

41
00:02:18,615 --> 00:02:20,456
it's time to use

42
00:02:20,536 --> 00:02:22,016
our Third Priest.

43
00:02:22,655 --> 00:02:23,375
Yes.

44
00:02:43,976 --> 00:02:45,416
Third Priest understood.

45
00:02:56,296 --> 00:02:57,375
(My brother used to practice)

46
00:02:57,375 --> 00:02:58,176
(day and night,)

47
00:02:58,615 --> 00:02:59,935
(14 to 16 hours a day,)

48
00:03:00,416 --> 00:03:01,215
(while for me,)

49
00:03:01,456 --> 00:03:02,736
(it's still not enough,)

50
00:03:03,296 --> 00:03:04,576
(far from enough.)

51
00:03:10,456 --> 00:03:11,016
Who's there?

52
00:03:13,256 --> 00:03:14,176
It's me.

53
00:03:18,775 --> 00:03:19,495
Rong.

54
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:20,416
What are you doing

55
00:03:20,495 --> 00:03:21,335
at this late hour?

56
00:03:22,256 --> 00:03:23,536
What are you doing here,

57
00:03:23,615 --> 00:03:24,456
not sleeping?

58
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:26,375
I'm practicing.

59
00:03:26,856 --> 00:03:28,136
So you can practice,

60
00:03:28,215 --> 00:03:29,495
but others can't?

61
00:03:30,856 --> 00:03:31,856
By the way, Rong,

62
00:03:32,775 --> 00:03:34,095
did you just see

63
00:03:34,176 --> 00:03:35,176
a shadow flashing by?

64
00:03:35,976 --> 00:03:37,416
What shadow?

65
00:03:37,576 --> 00:03:38,215
You must have been

66
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:39,576
too absorbed in your practice,

67
00:03:39,895 --> 00:03:42,335
or been dizzy

68
00:03:42,456 --> 00:03:43,375
and with double vision.

69
00:03:44,895 --> 00:03:46,215
How could it be?

70
00:03:47,256 --> 00:03:49,016
I clearly saw it just now.

71
00:03:52,016 --> 00:03:53,615
Who could it be?
It's already late at night.

72
00:03:54,256 --> 00:03:55,416
Let's go check it out.

73
00:04:00,976 --> 00:04:02,095
Qingshi is here too?

74
00:04:02,176 --> 00:04:02,815
Yes.

75
00:04:03,615 --> 00:04:04,296
This way, please.

76
00:04:23,296 --> 00:04:25,135
This kid has grown up.

77
00:04:25,375 --> 00:04:27,416
I've never seen him so diligent.

78
00:04:37,255 --> 00:04:38,055
Brother.

79
00:04:45,656 --> 00:04:46,135
I...

80
00:04:47,856 --> 00:04:50,015
I-I am not hallucinating?

81
00:04:50,976 --> 00:04:51,815
It's me.

82
00:04:53,336 --> 00:04:54,216
Brother.

83
00:04:54,976 --> 00:04:56,255
I-I thought I would never

84
00:04:56,255 --> 00:04:57,495
see you again.

85
00:04:57,615 --> 00:04:58,575
I thought you had already...

86
00:04:58,695 --> 00:04:59,815
Already what?

87
00:04:59,935 --> 00:05:00,736
Still crying

88
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:01,815
like you were a child.

89
00:05:02,615 --> 00:05:03,976
Alright, stop crying.

90
00:05:04,615 --> 00:05:05,815
(Why is he here?)

91
00:05:09,416 --> 00:05:10,055
Brother,

92
00:05:10,296 --> 00:05:11,375
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong,

93
00:05:11,495 --> 00:05:12,736
and everyone in Snow Stone Fort

94
00:05:12,815 --> 00:05:14,015
miss you dearly.

95
00:05:14,255 --> 00:05:15,096
I know.

96
00:05:15,856 --> 00:05:16,615
Qingshi,

97
00:05:17,575 --> 00:05:19,135
once I finish my business

98
00:05:19,375 --> 00:05:20,896
and handle everything,

99
00:05:21,255 --> 00:05:22,575
let's go back to
Xueying Territory together.

100
00:05:25,935 --> 00:05:26,815
Get rest early.

101
00:05:40,416 --> 00:05:41,096
Rong,

102
00:05:41,976 --> 00:05:42,935
what's wrong?

103
00:05:43,935 --> 00:05:45,176
Nothing.

104
00:05:45,736 --> 00:05:47,815
I'm just happy to see

105
00:05:47,935 --> 00:05:49,135
you and your brother so close.

106
00:05:51,015 --> 00:05:52,495
But you'll go back to Xueying Territory

107
00:05:52,495 --> 00:05:53,656
with your brother

108
00:05:54,135 --> 00:05:55,815
and we'll be apart.

109
00:05:56,015 --> 00:05:57,776
I'll still be alone,

110
00:05:58,255 --> 00:05:59,575
with no one to rely on.

111
00:06:01,615 --> 00:06:02,296
Rong,

112
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,055
would you like to come with us

113
00:06:04,176 --> 00:06:05,416
and visit Xueying Territory?

114
00:06:08,296 --> 00:06:08,896
Xueying Territory

115
00:06:09,015 --> 00:06:10,736
is your Dongbo Clan's territory.

116
00:06:10,896 --> 00:06:12,495
Snow Stone Fort is your home.

117
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,375
As an outsider,

118
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:16,656
I'd better not bother you there.

119
00:06:16,736 --> 00:06:17,336
Rong,

120
00:06:17,455 --> 00:06:18,455
how could you think that way?

121
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:19,575
You know what?

122
00:06:19,695 --> 00:06:20,575
In my heart,

123
00:06:20,695 --> 00:06:21,976
you're my best friend,

124
00:06:22,055 --> 00:06:23,615
just like my family.

125
00:06:24,135 --> 00:06:25,495
Even if you agree,

126
00:06:25,615 --> 00:06:27,135
your brother wouldn't.

127
00:06:27,976 --> 00:06:28,935
So don't even

128
00:06:28,935 --> 00:06:30,495
bring it up to your brother,

129
00:06:30,575 --> 00:06:31,815
so as to avoid awkwardness.

130
00:06:32,896 --> 00:06:33,856
How come?

131
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:35,055
I assure you

132
00:06:35,055 --> 00:06:36,455
my brother will definitely
give you a warm welcome.

133
00:06:36,575 --> 00:06:37,976
Wait here. I'll go talk to him.

134
00:06:44,736 --> 00:06:45,416
Brother.

135
00:06:50,935 --> 00:06:52,615
Brother, may I have a word with you?

136
00:07:00,695 --> 00:07:01,375
Brother,

137
00:07:01,575 --> 00:07:02,336
I want to bring Ji Rong

138
00:07:02,336 --> 00:07:03,375
back to Xueying Territory with us.

139
00:07:04,135 --> 00:07:06,455
Actually, this time when I go back,

140
00:07:06,776 --> 00:07:07,976
I have a lot of things to discuss

141
00:07:08,096 --> 00:07:09,015
with Uncle Zong and Uncle Tong San.

142
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:10,015
We also need to plan

143
00:07:10,015 --> 00:07:11,336
our next steps together.

144
00:07:11,656 --> 00:07:12,935
Would it be inconvenient

145
00:07:13,176 --> 00:07:14,375
to have an outsider around?

146
00:07:14,495 --> 00:07:15,055
Brother,

147
00:07:15,976 --> 00:07:18,296
Rong is the person I like.

148
00:07:18,935 --> 00:07:19,935
I like her.

149
00:07:20,336 --> 00:07:21,416
I trust her.

150
00:07:21,695 --> 00:07:22,615
Moreover,

151
00:07:23,216 --> 00:07:24,296
these days,

152
00:07:25,495 --> 00:07:26,176
I no longer

153
00:07:26,176 --> 00:07:27,416
consider her an outsider.

154
00:07:30,375 --> 00:07:32,416
Brother, you have to trust me.

155
00:07:33,096 --> 00:07:35,135
I've made up my mind about her.

156
00:07:41,776 --> 00:07:43,255
(Senior Dugu Ling.)

157
00:07:44,455 --> 00:07:46,135
You came in such large numbers.

158
00:07:47,176 --> 00:07:48,536
What is your purpose?

159
00:07:48,935 --> 00:07:49,856
Elder Bai,

160
00:07:50,176 --> 00:07:51,896
I apologize for the late-night visit,

161
00:07:52,015 --> 00:07:53,216
but there is a matter

162
00:07:53,375 --> 00:07:55,375
I need to clarify with you in person.

163
00:07:56,096 --> 00:07:56,935
Outside the walls

164
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:58,495
of the Black Wind God Palace
at the bottom of the Black Wind Cliff,

165
00:07:58,615 --> 00:08:00,096
there is a huge crack

166
00:08:00,455 --> 00:08:02,815
that extends from the ground

167
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:03,856
to the top along the cliff.

168
00:08:03,976 --> 00:08:05,656
It is caused by
some highly skilled when cultivating.

169
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:07,375
I wonder, Elder Bai,

170
00:08:07,455 --> 00:08:08,615
if you are aware of this.

171
00:08:08,736 --> 00:08:09,896
(How could it be him?)

172
00:08:10,015 --> 00:08:10,935
Over the years,

173
00:08:11,055 --> 00:08:12,416
I have been devoted to my practice,

174
00:08:12,536 --> 00:08:14,336
not knowing any of the elders,

175
00:08:14,416 --> 00:08:15,896
let alone you.

176
00:08:16,055 --> 00:08:17,416
What's your name?

177
00:08:17,536 --> 00:08:18,896
You don't even know the basic courtesy

178
00:08:19,015 --> 00:08:19,776
of introducing yourself.

179
00:08:20,296 --> 00:08:21,096
Why should I

180
00:08:21,096 --> 00:08:22,536
answer your question?

181
00:08:26,856 --> 00:08:27,575
Master.

182
00:08:28,695 --> 00:08:29,375
Master,

183
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,336
this is my brother,

184
00:08:31,416 --> 00:08:32,455
Dongbo Xueying.

185
00:08:33,656 --> 00:08:34,935
I'm Dongbo Xueying.

186
00:08:35,016 --> 00:08:36,016
Greetings, Master Bai.

187
00:08:36,896 --> 00:08:38,735
(So, this is Dongbo Xueying.)

188
00:08:38,935 --> 00:08:40,215
(Yu's son.)

189
00:08:40,815 --> 00:08:42,536
(Such a powerful aura.)

190
00:08:42,735 --> 00:08:44,695
In the world today,
someone with such skills,

191
00:08:44,815 --> 00:08:46,416
and able to make such a crack,

192
00:08:46,616 --> 00:08:47,855
is either deceased

193
00:08:47,975 --> 00:08:49,335
or has greatly declined in power.

194
00:08:49,455 --> 00:08:50,256
Besides you,

195
00:08:50,695 --> 00:08:51,735
it would be hard for anyone to tear open

196
00:08:51,855 --> 00:08:53,176
such a large crack.

197
00:08:53,455 --> 00:08:54,095
How do you

198
00:08:54,296 --> 00:08:55,575
explain this?

199
00:08:55,695 --> 00:08:57,735
You expect me to explain
just because you asked?

200
00:08:58,296 --> 00:08:59,776
Young man,

201
00:08:59,896 --> 00:09:01,296
you're too rude.

202
00:09:02,296 --> 00:09:03,896
You came so late at night.

203
00:09:03,975 --> 00:09:05,256
I have already

204
00:09:05,256 --> 00:09:07,016
shown my hospitality by letting you in.

205
00:09:07,296 --> 00:09:09,176
As for anything else,
please feel free to help yourselves.

206
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:11,815
I'm sorry, but I won't be able
to accompany you any further.

207
00:09:13,896 --> 00:09:14,695
Stop right there.

208
00:09:16,335 --> 00:09:17,935
Elder, as you're being so secretive,

209
00:09:18,256 --> 00:09:20,095
you must be hiding something, right?

210
00:09:20,215 --> 00:09:22,176
Was Dugu Ling from twenty years ago

211
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:23,656
you?

212
00:09:23,656 --> 00:09:25,176
Dugu Ling suddenly
disappeared back then

213
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:26,656
and coincidentally appeared today.

214
00:09:26,776 --> 00:09:28,055
There's some suspicion.

215
00:09:28,136 --> 00:09:28,896
Otherwise,

216
00:09:29,055 --> 00:09:30,975
why are you not willing to
prove your innocence?

217
00:09:31,176 --> 00:09:32,695
Without conclusive evidence,

218
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,776
we can't jump to conclusions.

219
00:09:35,975 --> 00:09:37,016
As we've already come all this way,

220
00:09:37,536 --> 00:09:39,215
how can we return empty-handed?

221
00:09:39,536 --> 00:09:40,536
Elder Bai,

222
00:09:41,496 --> 00:09:42,335
my apologies.

223
00:09:48,016 --> 00:09:48,815
Master,

224
00:09:48,855 --> 00:09:50,055
what spell is this?

225
00:09:50,176 --> 00:09:51,376
My brother is gone?

226
00:09:51,536 --> 00:09:52,256
Don't worry.

227
00:09:53,136 --> 00:09:54,575
They will be fine,

228
00:09:55,776 --> 00:09:57,055
especially your brother.

229
00:10:08,735 --> 00:10:09,776
Bai Yuanzhi,

230
00:10:11,136 --> 00:10:13,136
I've treated you with formality,
but you seem to want a penalty.

231
00:10:13,575 --> 00:10:15,055
How dare you set a trap for us?

232
00:10:15,776 --> 00:10:17,416
You want me to smash it?

233
00:10:31,296 --> 00:10:32,496
If we try to break through by force,

234
00:10:32,616 --> 00:10:33,136
this barrier

235
00:10:33,136 --> 00:10:34,256
can't trap us for sure.

236
00:10:34,376 --> 00:10:35,256
But these juniors

237
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:36,136
would be in trouble.

238
00:10:39,575 --> 00:10:40,896
So what do we do now?

239
00:10:41,416 --> 00:10:43,016
Are we supposed to just wait here?

240
00:10:45,416 --> 00:10:46,296
Master Bai,

241
00:10:46,855 --> 00:10:48,776
our sudden visit may be inappropriate.

242
00:10:49,176 --> 00:10:50,975
Please forgive any offense.

243
00:10:57,536 --> 00:10:58,735
I don't believe

244
00:10:59,815 --> 00:11:00,975
my power

245
00:11:00,975 --> 00:11:02,616
can't break this stupid thing.

246
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:21,815
Master Tai Shu.

247
00:11:23,376 --> 00:11:24,016
I think

248
00:11:25,016 --> 00:11:26,136
there should be
more than one critical point

249
00:11:26,296 --> 00:11:27,176
for this formation spell.

250
00:11:27,376 --> 00:11:28,455
I just noticed

251
00:11:28,815 --> 00:11:29,575
when you were hitting

252
00:11:29,735 --> 00:11:30,536
the front forcefully,

253
00:11:31,016 --> 00:11:32,616
a light ring appeared at the back.

254
00:11:33,176 --> 00:11:34,975
Although the light ring looks small,

255
00:11:35,256 --> 00:11:36,055
I think

256
00:11:36,256 --> 00:11:37,735
that should be the key to
breaking the formation spell.

257
00:11:38,256 --> 00:11:39,735
Since there is
more than one critical point,

258
00:11:39,855 --> 00:11:41,335
if we only exert force in one place,

259
00:11:41,455 --> 00:11:43,176
the formation spell will remain intact.

260
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,256
Why not

261
00:11:44,455 --> 00:11:46,055
you and Master Sikong work together,

262
00:11:46,215 --> 00:11:47,136
applying force both at front and back?

263
00:11:47,256 --> 00:11:48,416
It might have a miraculous effect.

264
00:12:06,095 --> 00:12:06,695
Brother.

265
00:12:08,735 --> 00:12:09,335
Brother,

266
00:12:09,575 --> 00:12:10,616
are you alright?

267
00:12:10,616 --> 00:12:11,256
I'm fine.

268
00:12:12,815 --> 00:12:13,695
Elder Bai,

269
00:12:13,935 --> 00:12:15,896
I can't believe
you set up a barrier to ambush us.

270
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,016
If you want a fight,
fight fair and square.

271
00:12:18,176 --> 00:12:19,575
What do you have to compete with me?

272
00:12:20,296 --> 00:12:22,136
You managed to escape from the barrier

273
00:12:22,376 --> 00:12:23,455
because, among you,

274
00:12:23,455 --> 00:12:24,536
there is a smart person.

275
00:12:25,095 --> 00:12:26,256
And that person

276
00:12:26,695 --> 00:12:28,136
is not you.

277
00:12:29,016 --> 00:12:30,215
Dongbo Xueying,

278
00:12:30,335 --> 00:12:32,176
you really aren't for nothing.

279
00:12:33,136 --> 00:12:35,376
Alas, the younger generation
will surpass the older one eventually.

280
00:12:37,016 --> 00:12:39,095
Master Bai, what do you mean?

281
00:12:39,296 --> 00:12:40,616
I would like to know the details.

282
00:12:41,095 --> 00:12:42,376
If you have a chance

283
00:12:42,735 --> 00:12:44,335
to meet your mother,

284
00:12:44,896 --> 00:12:45,815
tell her

285
00:12:46,136 --> 00:12:47,815
that she has a good son.

286
00:12:51,176 --> 00:12:53,296
Since you refuse
to reveal your identity, Sir,

287
00:12:54,055 --> 00:12:55,536
and deliberately change the subject,

288
00:12:55,695 --> 00:12:57,815
I have no choice but to offend.

289
00:13:23,215 --> 00:13:24,296
Both elders, please stop.

290
00:13:27,016 --> 00:13:27,735
Master.

291
00:13:30,376 --> 00:13:31,136
Tell us now,

292
00:13:31,296 --> 00:13:31,975
do you know or not

293
00:13:31,975 --> 00:13:32,935
the whereabouts of Si Borong?

294
00:13:33,296 --> 00:13:34,656
I have nothing to say.

295
00:13:35,176 --> 00:13:36,055
Master Bai,

296
00:13:36,376 --> 00:13:37,656
if you could explain it clearly,

297
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:39,215
we wouldn't be so rude.

298
00:13:39,656 --> 00:13:41,455
This matter has nothing to do with you.

299
00:13:42,176 --> 00:13:43,896
Don't get involved.

300
00:13:44,296 --> 00:13:45,335
Otherwise, it's easy

301
00:13:45,496 --> 00:13:46,855
to bring trouble upon yourself.

302
00:13:47,935 --> 00:13:49,536
Why can't you just tell us normally?

303
00:13:49,656 --> 00:13:50,896
Do you have to make it like this?

304
00:13:52,496 --> 00:13:53,176
I think we should

305
00:13:53,176 --> 00:13:54,335
lock him up now

306
00:13:54,496 --> 00:13:55,376
and continue our investigation.

307
00:13:55,735 --> 00:13:57,136
Let's see how long
he can keep his mouth shut.

308
00:13:57,575 --> 00:13:58,656
Absolutely not.

309
00:13:58,776 --> 00:14:00,095
Locking up a great mage

310
00:14:00,136 --> 00:14:01,455
without solid evidence,

311
00:14:01,455 --> 00:14:02,376
if this spreads outside,

312
00:14:02,376 --> 00:14:04,055
how can the Council face the world?

313
00:14:04,215 --> 00:14:05,855
What's the difference
between this and banditry?

314
00:14:06,575 --> 00:14:07,735
If he can't explain clearly,

315
00:14:07,896 --> 00:14:09,335
we can't let him go.

316
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,656
Come on.

317
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,855
Let's stop for now.

318
00:14:21,975 --> 00:14:22,975
Good food and wine.

319
00:14:23,055 --> 00:14:24,095
Let's eat first.

320
00:14:24,215 --> 00:14:24,776
Come on.

321
00:14:26,416 --> 00:14:27,695
Alright, let's go.

322
00:14:27,735 --> 00:14:28,416
Young lady,

323
00:14:28,616 --> 00:14:29,695
what are you doing?

324
00:14:29,855 --> 00:14:30,935
Today, I'm treating everyone.

325
00:14:30,935 --> 00:14:31,896
Please take a seat.

326
00:14:33,455 --> 00:14:34,176
Have a seat.

327
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:35,335
Tomorrow,

328
00:14:35,496 --> 00:14:36,735
we'll be leaving this place.

329
00:14:36,855 --> 00:14:37,815
I don't know if we'll ever

330
00:14:37,815 --> 00:14:39,416
have a chance to meet again.

331
00:14:39,575 --> 00:14:40,215
Yes.

332
00:14:40,455 --> 00:14:41,055
I think

333
00:14:41,176 --> 00:14:42,416
even if I stay another year or two,

334
00:14:42,536 --> 00:14:43,335
I won't be able to learn.

335
00:14:44,695 --> 00:14:46,496
I told you before
that you wouldn't be able to,

336
00:14:46,656 --> 00:14:47,416
but you didn't believe me.

337
00:14:48,176 --> 00:14:49,896
So, without further ado,

338
00:14:50,016 --> 00:14:50,695
today

339
00:14:50,695 --> 00:14:51,975
is our farewell banquet.

340
00:14:52,095 --> 00:14:53,896
Let's drink, eat,

341
00:14:54,016 --> 00:14:55,815
relax, and chat.

342
00:14:56,935 --> 00:14:58,575
Alright, cheers.

343
00:14:58,575 --> 00:14:59,536
Cheers, pour it up.

344
00:14:59,536 --> 00:15:00,496
I'll finish it.

345
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:01,256
Bottoms up! Bottoms up!

346
00:15:01,256 --> 00:15:01,855
Fill it up.

347
00:15:01,896 --> 00:15:02,496
Here.

348
00:15:02,496 --> 00:15:03,616
Here, fill it up.

349
00:15:04,376 --> 00:15:05,335
Cheers.

350
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:06,496
Bottoms up.

351
00:15:06,616 --> 00:15:07,496
Come on.

352
00:15:08,616 --> 00:15:09,575
Great wine.

353
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,855
Come on, have some more.

354
00:15:10,896 --> 00:15:12,536
I see there's
an alchemy furnace over there.

355
00:15:12,536 --> 00:15:13,536
It's always been broken.

356
00:15:13,575 --> 00:15:14,815
Why is it still there?

357
00:15:14,896 --> 00:15:15,815
Well,

358
00:15:15,935 --> 00:15:17,575
it hasn't been broken for long.

359
00:15:17,815 --> 00:15:19,896
Was it broken

360
00:15:19,896 --> 00:15:20,975
while refining weapons?

361
00:15:21,335 --> 00:15:22,176
You could say that.

362
00:15:22,215 --> 00:15:23,896
What kind of thing is so powerful

363
00:15:24,296 --> 00:15:25,695
that it could

364
00:15:25,695 --> 00:15:26,656
break an alchemy furnace?

365
00:15:26,695 --> 00:15:27,695
They needed it in such a hurry

366
00:15:27,855 --> 00:15:28,855
and we didn't have
any Blood Spirit Stone.

367
00:15:29,016 --> 00:15:30,256
Even if we worked day and night,

368
00:15:30,455 --> 00:15:31,455
we weren't able to magic it.

369
00:15:31,815 --> 00:15:33,376
Exactly, it's impossible to complete.

370
00:15:33,455 --> 00:15:35,575
Blood Spirit Stones
are extremely precious.

371
00:15:36,376 --> 00:15:37,776
It is said to be used for refining

372
00:15:37,776 --> 00:15:39,095
Bloodshed Weapons, right?

373
00:15:40,496 --> 00:15:41,016
She knows quite a bit.

374
00:15:41,016 --> 00:15:41,815
I didn't expect you

375
00:15:41,815 --> 00:15:42,935
to know so much about weapons.

376
00:15:42,935 --> 00:15:43,575
Isn't that right?

377
00:15:44,296 --> 00:15:45,376
I know about it too.

378
00:15:45,496 --> 00:15:46,975
It's said that Bloodshed Weapons

379
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:47,855
are more convenient to operate

380
00:15:47,855 --> 00:15:49,176
than ordinary weapons.

381
00:15:49,215 --> 00:15:50,496
But their power is even greater.

382
00:15:50,616 --> 00:15:52,016
What's more, they can

383
00:15:52,016 --> 00:15:53,376
grow with their owners, right?

384
00:15:54,935 --> 00:15:57,215
A single Bloodshed Weapon

385
00:15:57,215 --> 00:15:58,496
is incredibly expensive.

386
00:15:58,656 --> 00:16:00,256
Those who can afford it

387
00:16:00,256 --> 00:16:00,975
and have the ability

388
00:16:00,975 --> 00:16:02,496
must be from a large family, right?

389
00:16:02,656 --> 00:16:03,496
That's only because they rely on

390
00:16:03,496 --> 00:16:04,496
the family's resources.

391
00:16:04,496 --> 00:16:05,616
Each generation gets worse.

392
00:16:06,575 --> 00:16:07,896
Cheers.

393
00:16:08,055 --> 00:16:09,896
(It's the Moyang family. No doubt.)

394
00:16:12,258 --> 00:16:14,095
(Moyang's Fort)

395
00:16:19,055 --> 00:16:20,536
How should we enter this time?

396
00:16:21,335 --> 00:16:22,455
Do you want to disguise yourself again?

397
00:16:24,815 --> 00:16:25,935
Then leave it to me.

398
00:16:31,136 --> 00:16:31,776
Bro.

399
00:16:33,055 --> 00:16:33,735
Stop.

400
00:16:34,335 --> 00:16:35,256
What are you doing here?

401
00:16:35,416 --> 00:16:36,575
Don't you remember me?

402
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:38,575
Think back carefully.

403
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:40,416
- You are...?
- I...

404
00:16:42,256 --> 00:16:43,176
My foot.

405
00:16:43,735 --> 00:16:44,335
You are

406
00:16:44,335 --> 00:16:45,896
the one who attended
Fort Master's birthday party.

407
00:16:46,536 --> 00:16:47,855
It's me, it's me.

408
00:16:48,575 --> 00:16:49,695
Catch him.

409
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:51,176
- Stop.
- Don't run.

410
00:16:51,176 --> 00:16:52,095
- Don't run, stop.
- Don't run.

411
00:16:52,095 --> 00:16:53,256
- Stop.
- Don't run.

412
00:16:55,536 --> 00:16:56,215
Let's go.

413
00:17:12,295 --> 00:17:13,176
This should be

414
00:17:13,176 --> 00:17:15,056
Moyang Chen's
secret cultivation chamber.

415
00:17:16,775 --> 00:17:18,096
What are these hanging scripts

416
00:17:18,136 --> 00:17:19,015
all about?

417
00:17:19,535 --> 00:17:20,616
They seem to be

418
00:17:20,735 --> 00:17:22,455
from a set of secret techniques.

419
00:17:22,616 --> 00:17:23,616
I'll memorize them first.

420
00:17:23,735 --> 00:17:25,056
Maybe someone can decipher them.

421
00:17:45,816 --> 00:17:47,896
The mage who practices these spells

422
00:17:48,056 --> 00:17:49,455
must have a strong comprehension.

423
00:17:49,616 --> 00:17:50,255
So, by speculation,

424
00:17:50,255 --> 00:17:51,295
the owner should be...

425
00:17:51,455 --> 00:17:53,215
Moyang Chen. It must be him.

426
00:18:00,176 --> 00:18:01,255
Well, Youyue.

427
00:18:01,416 --> 00:18:02,775
There are so many scripts

428
00:18:02,935 --> 00:18:04,656
and they all look similar to me.

429
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:05,935
This stack of them

430
00:18:05,975 --> 00:18:06,775
records the mage's

431
00:18:06,775 --> 00:18:07,856
process of deduction

432
00:18:07,856 --> 00:18:08,935
of doing model experiments.

433
00:18:09,376 --> 00:18:10,056
It seems

434
00:18:10,416 --> 00:18:12,136
he must be very eager to improve.

435
00:18:27,336 --> 00:18:28,136
Moyang Chen.

436
00:18:30,455 --> 00:18:31,096
Let's go.

437
00:18:47,735 --> 00:18:49,215
Aren't you curious

438
00:18:49,535 --> 00:18:50,616
why I suddenly

439
00:18:50,735 --> 00:18:52,336
came over today?

440
00:18:54,336 --> 00:18:56,416
Your amazing son

441
00:18:56,935 --> 00:18:58,856
defeated the Demon General,

442
00:18:58,856 --> 00:18:59,975
Xiang Pangyun.

443
00:19:01,495 --> 00:19:03,295
If you still refuse to reveal

444
00:19:03,295 --> 00:19:05,295
the secret of the Ancient Bloodline,

445
00:19:05,816 --> 00:19:07,096
don't blame me

446
00:19:07,495 --> 00:19:09,495
for taking action against your son.

447
00:19:13,495 --> 00:19:15,695
If you dare to hurt my Xueying,

448
00:19:17,295 --> 00:19:19,056
I won't let you know the secret

449
00:19:19,215 --> 00:19:20,576
in this lifetime.

450
00:19:21,136 --> 00:19:21,695
You...

451
00:19:26,376 --> 00:19:28,096
Xueying's mother?

452
00:19:35,896 --> 00:19:36,535
Youyue,

453
00:19:36,735 --> 00:19:37,816
your Inner Sight Technique is fantastic.

454
00:19:37,816 --> 00:19:38,376
You can even discover

455
00:19:38,376 --> 00:19:39,455
Moyang Chen's secret.

456
00:19:39,656 --> 00:19:40,455
Of course.

457
00:19:40,455 --> 00:19:41,896
Look who this young lady is.

458
00:19:42,215 --> 00:19:43,416
We have to hurry back

459
00:19:43,455 --> 00:19:44,215
and report everything

460
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:45,416
that happened here to Master.

461
00:19:45,576 --> 00:19:46,336
Also,

462
00:19:46,336 --> 00:19:47,735
I'm so glad that

463
00:19:47,735 --> 00:19:48,535
Xueying hasn't died yet.

464
00:19:48,616 --> 00:19:49,295
Let's go.

465
00:19:50,535 --> 00:19:51,896
Since we have captured him,

466
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,376
let's take our time
interrogating him later.

467
00:19:53,416 --> 00:19:54,295
Judging from his act,

468
00:19:54,295 --> 00:19:55,775
we probably won't get much out of him.

469
00:19:56,495 --> 00:19:57,695
But we still have to try.

470
00:19:57,856 --> 00:19:58,376
Those students

471
00:19:58,376 --> 00:19:59,255
have been missing for so many days.

472
00:19:59,336 --> 00:20:00,975
Who has the time
to keep dealing with them?

473
00:20:14,816 --> 00:20:15,735
Master Bai,

474
00:20:16,136 --> 00:20:17,695
I was too impulsive in my search

475
00:20:17,695 --> 00:20:18,576
for the missing ones previously.

476
00:20:18,656 --> 00:20:20,495
Please show leniency
considering I'm a brother

477
00:20:20,616 --> 00:20:22,616
and forgive me for my recklessness.

478
00:20:22,816 --> 00:20:24,136
If you know

479
00:20:24,136 --> 00:20:25,656
the whereabouts of
the missing Changfeng students,

480
00:20:25,816 --> 00:20:27,015
please tell me.

481
00:20:28,975 --> 00:20:29,816
Master Bai.

482
00:20:48,735 --> 00:20:49,656
Senior.

483
00:20:51,775 --> 00:20:53,136
It was really you.

484
00:20:54,096 --> 00:20:55,576
How did you become like this?

485
00:20:55,775 --> 00:20:57,096
What happened to your face?

486
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,056
Back then,

487
00:21:00,656 --> 00:21:03,856
during the battle
with the Great Demon God,

488
00:21:04,215 --> 00:21:06,096
I was poisoned by demonic poison.

489
00:21:06,455 --> 00:21:08,056
So, I could only run away

490
00:21:08,176 --> 00:21:10,455
to avoid tarnishing
the reputation of our faction.

491
00:21:10,856 --> 00:21:11,975
But over the years,

492
00:21:13,056 --> 00:21:14,856
the demonic poison has gotten severer

493
00:21:15,015 --> 00:21:17,735
and I've become a half-demon.

494
00:21:18,656 --> 00:21:19,975
Senior,

495
00:21:21,255 --> 00:21:23,336
since you left the Water Daoist Temple,

496
00:21:23,535 --> 00:21:25,336
we have had no news from you
for so many years.

497
00:21:25,495 --> 00:21:26,576
We thought you...

498
00:21:26,576 --> 00:21:28,535
Thought I was dead, right?

499
00:21:30,096 --> 00:21:31,775
It would be better if I were dead.

500
00:21:32,215 --> 00:21:33,856
So, I would be free.

501
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,056
But there's one thing

502
00:21:36,056 --> 00:21:37,096
I haven't done.

503
00:21:37,376 --> 00:21:38,416
Senior,

504
00:21:38,495 --> 00:21:39,416
if you have anything,

505
00:21:39,416 --> 00:21:40,336
you can tell me.

506
00:21:40,336 --> 00:21:42,015
I'll help you handle it.

507
00:21:44,455 --> 00:21:45,616
You don't need to say anything.

508
00:21:46,336 --> 00:21:47,656
Your poisoning is too deep.

509
00:21:47,856 --> 00:21:49,616
I will do everything I can

510
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:51,176
to help you heal.

511
00:21:51,336 --> 00:21:52,255
Don't come over.

512
00:21:52,295 --> 00:21:53,455
Don't come over.

513
00:21:54,015 --> 00:21:54,816
Junior,

514
00:21:55,455 --> 00:21:57,376
I've tried all methods,

515
00:21:57,975 --> 00:21:59,336
but I haven't been able
to eradicate the demonic poison

516
00:21:59,336 --> 00:22:01,015
from my body.

517
00:22:01,295 --> 00:22:02,535
No one can do it.

518
00:22:02,535 --> 00:22:04,056
I can't hurt you.

519
00:22:04,376 --> 00:22:05,336
Besides,

520
00:22:05,975 --> 00:22:07,495
if someone sees

521
00:22:07,495 --> 00:22:09,056
you healing a demon,

522
00:22:09,215 --> 00:22:10,656
how will you face it?

523
00:22:10,656 --> 00:22:12,695
I don't care what others say.

524
00:22:12,695 --> 00:22:13,935
You are my Senior Brother.

525
00:22:14,015 --> 00:22:16,535
You don't care, but I do.

526
00:22:17,935 --> 00:22:19,455
For the sake of
our Water Daoist Temple's

527
00:22:19,455 --> 00:22:20,255
purity,

528
00:22:20,376 --> 00:22:21,255
I can't stand

529
00:22:21,255 --> 00:22:23,096
it having any flaws.

530
00:22:24,255 --> 00:22:25,775
If you really want to help me,

531
00:22:26,535 --> 00:22:27,616
then keep this secret

532
00:22:27,616 --> 00:22:28,576
deep in your heart.

533
00:22:28,576 --> 00:22:29,935
Don't talk about it with anyone.

534
00:22:29,975 --> 00:22:31,176
Don't let anyone know

535
00:22:31,176 --> 00:22:32,616
that I've been poisoned
by demonic poison.

536
00:22:33,336 --> 00:22:35,376
I don't want anyone to know

537
00:22:36,096 --> 00:22:37,576
that as a half-demon,

538
00:22:38,096 --> 00:22:38,816
I can still barely survive

539
00:22:38,816 --> 00:22:40,295
in this world.

540
00:22:42,495 --> 00:22:43,616
Senior.

541
00:23:04,896 --> 00:23:05,735
I just checked

542
00:23:05,735 --> 00:23:07,056
Master Bai's condition.

543
00:23:07,416 --> 00:23:08,416
When he was captured,

544
00:23:08,416 --> 00:23:09,376
due to his cultivation,

545
00:23:09,576 --> 00:23:10,495
his pulse was closed.

546
00:23:10,576 --> 00:23:11,856
With our interruption,

547
00:23:12,255 --> 00:23:13,416
if he doesn't return and repair

548
00:23:13,416 --> 00:23:14,495
in time,

549
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:16,416
his life will be in danger.

550
00:23:16,576 --> 00:23:17,576
Sikong Yang,

551
00:23:17,896 --> 00:23:19,735
we still don't know his true identity.

552
00:23:20,816 --> 00:23:21,695
I know.

553
00:23:21,896 --> 00:23:23,495
We shouldn't have captured him
in the first place.

554
00:23:23,656 --> 00:23:25,176
If something unexpected happens,

555
00:23:25,336 --> 00:23:25,975
people outside

556
00:23:25,975 --> 00:23:27,376
would think we killed him.

557
00:23:32,255 --> 00:23:33,056
Wait.

558
00:23:33,816 --> 00:23:34,856
We can't let him go.

559
00:23:35,056 --> 00:23:36,056
The reason?

560
00:23:36,495 --> 00:23:37,695
He's a half-demon.

561
00:23:37,975 --> 00:23:38,896
I saw it.

562
00:23:38,935 --> 00:23:39,616
He's half-human

563
00:23:39,616 --> 00:23:40,495
and half-demon.

564
00:23:40,576 --> 00:23:42,015
We can't let him go so easily.

565
00:23:44,215 --> 00:23:45,616
What did you see?

566
00:23:45,775 --> 00:23:46,896
Do you have any evidence?

567
00:23:47,255 --> 00:23:48,255
I know

568
00:23:48,535 --> 00:23:50,376
you're anxious

569
00:23:50,535 --> 00:23:51,376
to find your cousin,

570
00:23:51,416 --> 00:23:52,656
but you can't say whatever you want

571
00:23:52,816 --> 00:23:54,015
as you wish.

572
00:23:54,015 --> 00:23:55,775
You know how many people
could be affected by this?

573
00:24:01,856 --> 00:24:03,656
Master Bai, please forgive us.

574
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,695
Master Sikong,

575
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:08,695
we haven't figured out
the whole situation yet,

576
00:24:08,975 --> 00:24:10,656
so releasing him now

577
00:24:10,856 --> 00:24:11,975
might be a bit...

578
00:24:11,975 --> 00:24:13,856
On behalf of all the members
of Water Daoist Temple,

579
00:24:13,856 --> 00:24:15,096
I'll vouch for him.

580
00:24:21,935 --> 00:24:23,336
It's more important for Master Bai

581
00:24:23,495 --> 00:24:25,056
to return and heal his injuries first.

582
00:24:31,656 --> 00:24:33,495
(I obviously saw he's a half-demon.)

583
00:24:34,455 --> 00:24:36,056
(Could I be mistaken?)

584
00:24:39,455 --> 00:24:40,856
Our lord is back.

585
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:41,816
Our Xueying Territory's

586
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:43,416
most amazing Lord

587
00:24:43,416 --> 00:24:44,656
has returned.

588
00:24:44,656 --> 00:24:49,255
Our Lord is back.

589
00:24:50,816 --> 00:24:51,656
Great!

590
00:24:52,376 --> 00:24:53,656
He's back.

591
00:24:53,656 --> 00:24:55,056
Wonderful!

592
00:24:56,255 --> 00:24:57,015
Come on.

593
00:24:57,295 --> 00:24:58,255
- Commander Zong.
- Clean this up.

594
00:24:58,856 --> 00:24:59,656
Roast it.

595
00:24:59,896 --> 00:25:00,535
Alright.

596
00:25:00,535 --> 00:25:01,416
Let it be known,

597
00:25:01,576 --> 00:25:02,535
this month, everyone's pays

598
00:25:02,616 --> 00:25:03,376
will be doubled.

599
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:04,816
Thank you, Commander!

600
00:25:04,816 --> 00:25:05,656
I'll go spread the word now.

601
00:25:07,935 --> 00:25:09,176
You all continue your work.

602
00:25:09,535 --> 00:25:10,056
Alright.

603
00:25:17,576 --> 00:25:18,735
Transcendent?

604
00:25:18,856 --> 00:25:19,416
Brother,

605
00:25:19,535 --> 00:25:20,856
you really became Transcendent?

606
00:25:21,695 --> 00:25:23,015
It's not completely certain yet,

607
00:25:23,656 --> 00:25:25,215
but when I came up
from the Black Wind Cliff,

608
00:25:25,856 --> 00:25:26,935
I had clearly reached

609
00:25:27,015 --> 00:25:27,695
Transcendent

610
00:25:27,775 --> 00:25:29,096
in both my Dou Qi and body.

611
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:30,735
Jingqiu also witnessed it herself.

612
00:25:31,376 --> 00:25:32,535
But after that,

613
00:25:32,935 --> 00:25:33,416
when I practiced martial arts,

614
00:25:33,535 --> 00:25:34,735
I never had that feeling again.

615
00:25:36,176 --> 00:25:36,856
Brother,

616
00:25:36,935 --> 00:25:37,856
it might be because your injuries

617
00:25:37,935 --> 00:25:38,856
haven't fully healed yet.

618
00:25:39,015 --> 00:25:40,416
I think you
don't need to be too anxious.

619
00:25:40,535 --> 00:25:41,816
Recuperate first

620
00:25:41,975 --> 00:25:42,535
and then

621
00:25:42,616 --> 00:25:43,416
make the next plan.

622
00:25:43,856 --> 00:25:44,975
I have a feeling

623
00:25:45,735 --> 00:25:47,376
that every time I make progress,

624
00:25:48,416 --> 00:25:49,576
it's in a life-threatening

625
00:25:49,576 --> 00:25:50,535
critical moment.

626
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:52,616
So, I've decided

627
00:25:54,056 --> 00:25:55,455
to participate in Transcendent Trial.

628
00:25:55,856 --> 00:25:56,616
Really?

629
00:25:57,416 --> 00:25:58,215
When?

630
00:25:58,935 --> 00:26:00,176
I'll set out tomorrow

631
00:26:00,295 --> 00:26:01,336
to return to Changfeng Academy.

632
00:26:02,576 --> 00:26:03,775
If I pass the trial,

633
00:26:04,215 --> 00:26:05,015
I'll become

634
00:26:05,015 --> 00:26:05,896
Transcendent for real.

635
00:26:06,215 --> 00:26:06,856
That way,

636
00:26:07,056 --> 00:26:08,295
we can save our mother.

637
00:26:08,856 --> 00:26:10,215
Brother, this time,

638
00:26:10,215 --> 00:26:11,255
I want to go with you.

639
00:26:11,616 --> 00:26:12,215
No.

640
00:26:13,136 --> 00:26:14,255
I don't have full confidence

641
00:26:14,336 --> 00:26:15,616
in the Transcendent Trial.

642
00:26:16,295 --> 00:26:17,176
If you stay here

643
00:26:17,295 --> 00:26:18,295
to watch over Xueying Territory,

644
00:26:18,416 --> 00:26:19,096
I can be at ease.

645
00:26:19,096 --> 00:26:19,816
Brother, I...

646
00:26:19,816 --> 00:26:20,295
Listen.

647
00:26:22,495 --> 00:26:23,096
Be good.

648
00:26:35,816 --> 00:26:36,616
Who is it?

649
00:26:36,735 --> 00:26:38,215
Qingshi, it's me.

650
00:26:38,455 --> 00:26:39,215
Rong.

651
00:26:40,416 --> 00:26:40,975
Rong.

652
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:42,255
Have a seat.

653
00:26:42,376 --> 00:26:43,775
I accidentally saw your room's light

654
00:26:43,775 --> 00:26:44,576
still on.

655
00:26:44,695 --> 00:26:45,896
I thought you couldn't sleep.

656
00:26:46,215 --> 00:26:47,896
Master used to tell me

657
00:26:47,975 --> 00:26:48,735
when he was tired,

658
00:26:48,735 --> 00:26:49,896
the calming soup

659
00:26:50,015 --> 00:26:51,656
is very helpful for mental recovery.

660
00:26:51,775 --> 00:26:53,336
I thought it would be good for you,

661
00:26:53,455 --> 00:26:54,255
so I made it

662
00:26:54,255 --> 00:26:55,255
and brought it to you.

663
00:27:01,416 --> 00:27:02,376
Thank you, Rong.

664
00:27:02,495 --> 00:27:03,535
You're so kind to me.

665
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:06,295
You can't sleep at this hour.

666
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:07,535
Is there something wrong?

667
00:27:08,735 --> 00:27:09,656
It's my brother.

668
00:27:10,535 --> 00:27:11,896
He's going back to Changfeng Academy

669
00:27:11,975 --> 00:27:13,416
to participate in Transcendent Trial.

670
00:27:15,535 --> 00:27:16,775
Xueying

671
00:27:17,295 --> 00:27:19,096
has already become Transcendent?

672
00:27:19,215 --> 00:27:20,416
It's just that he's still unsure,

673
00:27:20,535 --> 00:27:21,616
so I'm worried.

674
00:27:22,215 --> 00:27:23,255
Although

675
00:27:23,376 --> 00:27:24,215
the Transcendent Trial

676
00:27:24,295 --> 00:27:25,816
will have many powerful people watching

677
00:27:25,975 --> 00:27:27,136
and even Demigods.

678
00:27:27,295 --> 00:27:28,535
Once someone encounters danger,

679
00:27:28,656 --> 00:27:30,096
they will step in to save them.

680
00:27:30,416 --> 00:27:31,735
But I just worry about him.

681
00:27:31,816 --> 00:27:33,176
I'm afraid he might have an accident.

682
00:27:33,816 --> 00:27:34,816
Perhaps your brother

683
00:27:34,816 --> 00:27:36,376
wants to become Transcendent sooner

684
00:27:36,455 --> 00:27:38,455
and then save your mother.

685
00:27:39,975 --> 00:27:41,616
Your family's bond

686
00:27:42,056 --> 00:27:43,535
is truly enviable.

687
00:27:44,656 --> 00:27:45,215
I originally

688
00:27:45,336 --> 00:27:46,576
wanted to accompany my brother.

689
00:27:47,416 --> 00:27:49,215
(I just arrived in Xueying Territory)

690
00:27:49,336 --> 00:27:50,816
(and I haven't found out anything yet.)

691
00:27:51,455 --> 00:27:52,656
(If he leaves,)

692
00:27:52,816 --> 00:27:53,535
(I have no reason)

693
00:27:53,535 --> 00:27:54,376
(to stay here.)

694
00:27:54,856 --> 00:27:55,535
(No way.)

695
00:27:55,616 --> 00:27:56,176
(I can't)

696
00:27:56,176 --> 00:27:57,295
(let him leave Snow Stone Fort.)

697
00:27:58,416 --> 00:27:59,735
What did your brother say?

698
00:27:59,816 --> 00:28:00,816
As always.

699
00:28:00,896 --> 00:28:02,215
He won't take me with him.

700
00:28:02,616 --> 00:28:03,896
He asked me to guard Xueying Territory.

701
00:28:05,096 --> 00:28:06,735
Xueying must make this arrangement

702
00:28:06,856 --> 00:28:08,255
for a reason.

703
00:28:08,656 --> 00:28:10,255
Just listen to his plan,

704
00:28:10,416 --> 00:28:11,255
so he can

705
00:28:11,255 --> 00:28:12,695
participate in the Transcendent Trial
with peace of mind.

706
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:13,576
But...

707
00:28:14,616 --> 00:28:16,136
You worry about Xueying,

708
00:28:16,775 --> 00:28:18,096
but you don't know

709
00:28:19,136 --> 00:28:21,015
that someone is worrying about you too.

710
00:28:32,656 --> 00:28:34,495
I understand, Rong.

711
00:29:03,096 --> 00:29:03,816
Ji Rong,

712
00:29:07,816 --> 00:29:08,856
what are you looking for?

713
00:29:10,376 --> 00:29:12,576
I can't find my earrings.

714
00:29:13,295 --> 00:29:14,295
Earrings?

715
00:29:14,416 --> 00:29:15,816
Aren't they on your ears?

716
00:29:17,535 --> 00:29:19,215
Not this pair. The other pair.

717
00:29:20,416 --> 00:29:21,856
Do you need me
to help you look for them?

718
00:29:22,015 --> 00:29:23,975
No need, go ahead.

719
00:29:24,535 --> 00:29:26,136
Why don't you have breakfast first?

720
00:29:26,215 --> 00:29:27,255
Take your time
looking for them after breakfast.

721
00:29:27,376 --> 00:29:28,935
Maybe they're somewhere else.

722
00:29:30,056 --> 00:29:30,656
Okay.

723
00:29:31,136 --> 00:29:32,376
Then I'll go first.

724
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,215
Jingqiu,

725
00:29:49,695 --> 00:29:50,416
what's the matter?

726
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,416
That Ji Rong.

727
00:29:53,576 --> 00:29:54,975
Do you know her well?

728
00:29:56,136 --> 00:29:57,215
As much as you know her.

729
00:29:57,336 --> 00:29:57,896
What happened?

730
00:29:58,215 --> 00:29:59,336
Just now,

731
00:29:59,495 --> 00:30:00,856
I saw her acting suspiciously,

732
00:30:00,975 --> 00:30:02,176
looking for something.

733
00:30:02,576 --> 00:30:04,056
She said she lost her earrings,

734
00:30:04,176 --> 00:30:04,935
but I clearly saw

735
00:30:04,975 --> 00:30:06,376
that she was wearing earrings.

736
00:30:06,816 --> 00:30:08,096
I don't know why,

737
00:30:08,215 --> 00:30:09,775
but I always feel something is off.

738
00:30:10,255 --> 00:30:11,416
Looking at her expression,

739
00:30:11,416 --> 00:30:12,616
I feel like she's lying.

740
00:30:12,856 --> 00:30:14,376
But maybe I'm overthinking.

741
00:30:14,856 --> 00:30:15,896
I didn't agree with her coming here

742
00:30:15,896 --> 00:30:16,775
in the first place.

743
00:30:17,176 --> 00:30:18,856
It was Qingshi
who insisted on bringing her.

744
00:30:19,176 --> 00:30:20,495
If there is a problem,

745
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:22,695
it may be that she told Qingshi

746
00:30:22,695 --> 00:30:23,695
she wanted to come.

747
00:30:24,376 --> 00:30:25,535
But,

748
00:30:25,856 --> 00:30:27,535
what is she looking for
in Snow Stone Fort?

749
00:30:28,136 --> 00:30:28,896
I don't know.

750
00:30:30,416 --> 00:30:31,856
Let's find out as soon as possible.

751
00:30:35,376 --> 00:30:35,975
Brother.

752
00:30:36,336 --> 00:30:37,136
Jingqiu.

753
00:30:37,856 --> 00:30:38,656
Qingshi.

754
00:30:38,816 --> 00:30:40,295
I'll leave after breakfast.

755
00:30:41,495 --> 00:30:42,856
I've figured it out, Brother.

756
00:30:42,975 --> 00:30:44,136
I'll stay in Xueying Territory.

757
00:30:44,295 --> 00:30:44,975
I'll listen to you.

758
00:30:46,856 --> 00:30:48,215
It's only been one night.

759
00:30:48,495 --> 00:30:49,775
How did you figure it out?

760
00:30:50,255 --> 00:30:51,735
Rong helped me.

761
00:30:51,856 --> 00:30:52,695
I really shouldn't

762
00:30:52,695 --> 00:30:53,975
always make you worry about me.

763
00:30:54,295 --> 00:30:55,576
Only if I stay in Xueying Territory

764
00:30:55,695 --> 00:30:56,735
can you wholeheartedly

765
00:30:56,735 --> 00:30:58,056
participate in the Transcendent Trial.

766
00:30:58,495 --> 00:30:59,495
And...

767
00:31:00,455 --> 00:31:01,336
And what?

768
00:31:03,015 --> 00:31:04,136
No, nothing.

769
00:31:06,455 --> 00:31:07,295
It seems

770
00:31:07,416 --> 00:31:08,336
Ji Rong

771
00:31:08,455 --> 00:31:09,816
is a sensible girl.

772
00:31:09,935 --> 00:31:11,136
She can even advise you.

773
00:31:11,376 --> 00:31:12,616
You two get along well.

774
00:31:12,816 --> 00:31:13,455
Brother,

775
00:31:13,576 --> 00:31:14,856
you also think
we're getting long well, right?

776
00:31:15,495 --> 00:31:16,816
What does her family do?

777
00:31:18,535 --> 00:31:19,735
Well.

778
00:31:19,975 --> 00:31:21,376
I'm not really sure.

779
00:31:21,495 --> 00:31:22,975
But I've heard from Rong

780
00:31:23,136 --> 00:31:24,616
that she lost her parents
when she was young.

781
00:31:25,176 --> 00:31:25,896
Ever since my master

782
00:31:25,896 --> 00:31:27,096
took her in,

783
00:31:27,255 --> 00:31:28,775
she has been following him.

784
00:31:30,416 --> 00:31:31,775
She's a pitiful girl.

785
00:31:33,096 --> 00:31:33,816
Right.

786
00:31:34,495 --> 00:31:35,616
So Rong

787
00:31:35,616 --> 00:31:36,896
has always been envious of us.

788
00:31:38,535 --> 00:31:39,416
Here come the pancakes.

789
00:31:39,616 --> 00:31:40,295
Rong.

790
00:31:47,015 --> 00:31:47,856
Let's eat.

791
00:31:49,215 --> 00:31:50,735
Here, I'll serve you porridge.

792
00:31:53,975 --> 00:31:54,816
Let's enjoy.

793
00:32:00,336 --> 00:32:01,416
The last time
I came to Xueying Territory,

794
00:32:01,416 --> 00:32:02,695
I didn't really get to explore.

795
00:32:02,695 --> 00:32:03,336
Yeah.

796
00:32:04,376 --> 00:32:06,336
Today's market seems bustling.

797
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:07,856
Let's have a good time.

798
00:32:10,616 --> 00:32:13,255
Pay up, pay up, pay up.

799
00:32:13,455 --> 00:32:14,176
Excuse me.

800
00:32:14,416 --> 00:32:15,295
What's going on?

801
00:32:15,535 --> 00:32:16,535
He lost a bet

802
00:32:16,535 --> 00:32:17,416
and won't pay.

803
00:32:17,495 --> 00:32:19,656
Right, he owes us a lot of money

804
00:32:19,856 --> 00:32:20,975
and still wants to run.

805
00:32:21,015 --> 00:32:22,336
No, no, hero.

806
00:32:22,336 --> 00:32:23,295
Please spare me, hero.

807
00:32:23,295 --> 00:32:24,136
No, no.

808
00:32:24,176 --> 00:32:25,975
Ji Rong, what's wrong?

809
00:32:26,695 --> 00:32:27,616
Nothing.

810
00:32:29,096 --> 00:32:29,896
Ji Rong.

811
00:32:31,455 --> 00:32:32,735
W-Where is Ji Rong?

812
00:32:37,535 --> 00:32:39,935
Daughter, is it really you?

813
00:32:43,015 --> 00:32:44,136
Daughter?

814
00:32:45,495 --> 00:32:46,376
How come you're here?

815
00:32:46,416 --> 00:32:47,336
Daughter,

816
00:32:48,295 --> 00:32:50,495
I was wrong. For real.

817
00:32:50,495 --> 00:32:52,695
D-Don't blame me, alright?

818
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:54,056
What are you doing?

819
00:32:54,056 --> 00:32:55,176
Pulling and dragging in the street.

820
00:32:55,176 --> 00:32:56,176
Aren't you embarrassed enough?

821
00:32:56,656 --> 00:32:57,775
Lost in gambling again, right?

822
00:33:01,176 --> 00:33:01,896
Is it enough?

823
00:33:09,096 --> 00:33:10,656
Do you see it? Huh?

824
00:33:11,096 --> 00:33:12,376
My daughter is so filial.

825
00:33:12,495 --> 00:33:14,255
"Daughter repaying father's debt."

826
00:33:15,015 --> 00:33:16,176
I have no choice.

827
00:33:16,176 --> 00:33:16,856
I have

828
00:33:16,856 --> 00:33:17,975
such a good daughter.

829
00:33:17,975 --> 00:33:19,096
It's infuriating, right?

830
00:33:20,495 --> 00:33:21,096
Here.

831
00:33:22,215 --> 00:33:23,056
Ji Wuhai,

832
00:33:23,295 --> 00:33:25,176
when did you have a daughter?

833
00:33:25,255 --> 00:33:26,975
It's none of your business.

834
00:33:27,096 --> 00:33:28,896
I am her biological father.

835
00:33:29,015 --> 00:33:30,096
So true.

836
00:33:31,376 --> 00:33:32,896
Buddies, let's go.

837
00:33:33,096 --> 00:33:33,735
Let's go.

838
00:33:36,015 --> 00:33:37,255
You said you're her father,

839
00:33:37,416 --> 00:33:38,295
but how can you prove it?

840
00:33:38,695 --> 00:33:40,096
Of course, I can prove it.

841
00:33:40,096 --> 00:33:40,616
I...

842
00:33:40,616 --> 00:33:41,535
Aren't you embarrassed enough?

843
00:33:41,535 --> 00:33:42,656
Addicted to gambling.

844
00:33:45,656 --> 00:33:46,376
Then I

845
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,056
will disappear from your sight now,

846
00:33:48,056 --> 00:33:48,735
alright?

847
00:33:49,935 --> 00:33:50,535
Everyone,

848
00:33:50,535 --> 00:33:52,255
excuse me.

849
00:33:56,616 --> 00:33:57,255
Rong,

850
00:33:57,535 --> 00:33:59,255
i-is he really your father?

851
00:33:59,376 --> 00:34:00,336
Didn't you say
that you lost your parents

852
00:34:00,336 --> 00:34:01,495
when you were young?

853
00:34:02,495 --> 00:34:03,816
He's addicted to gambling

854
00:34:04,215 --> 00:34:06,136
and caused the death of my mother
when I was little.

855
00:34:07,656 --> 00:34:08,895
It's the same with or without him.

856
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:24,096
Let's rest here for a while.

857
00:34:24,255 --> 00:34:24,656
Alright.

858
00:34:25,096 --> 00:34:25,656
Qingshi,

859
00:34:25,656 --> 00:34:26,576
come with me.

860
00:34:26,895 --> 00:34:27,496
Alright.

861
00:34:34,976 --> 00:34:35,936
What's wrong, Brother?

862
00:34:37,415 --> 00:34:38,215
There are some things

863
00:34:38,656 --> 00:34:40,215
I know you might not want to hear,

864
00:34:40,536 --> 00:34:42,335
but I won't be at ease
if I don't say them.

865
00:34:43,255 --> 00:34:44,735
Brother, just say it.

866
00:34:45,576 --> 00:34:46,576
We both left our parents

867
00:34:46,576 --> 00:34:47,735
when we were young.

868
00:34:47,976 --> 00:34:49,215
My memory of them

869
00:34:49,335 --> 00:34:50,656
has long become very vague.

870
00:34:50,815 --> 00:34:51,815
So in my heart,

871
00:34:51,936 --> 00:34:53,255
you are my only family,

872
00:34:53,576 --> 00:34:55,415
like a brother and a father.

873
00:34:55,735 --> 00:34:56,536
Ji Rong.

874
00:34:58,176 --> 00:34:59,215
Ji Rong?

875
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:00,375
Yes.

876
00:35:03,936 --> 00:35:06,255
Brother, what's wrong with Rong?

877
00:35:06,815 --> 00:35:08,415
During the time I've been with her,

878
00:35:08,695 --> 00:35:10,096
I always have a feeling

879
00:35:10,335 --> 00:35:11,215
that she seems to be

880
00:35:11,215 --> 00:35:12,096
hiding something.

881
00:35:12,576 --> 00:35:13,656
No way, Brother.

882
00:35:13,656 --> 00:35:14,976
Are you just too nervous?

883
00:35:15,176 --> 00:35:16,456
You just came back

884
00:35:16,456 --> 00:35:17,496
and you don't know Rong well.

885
00:35:17,616 --> 00:35:19,016
When I was at Master's house before,

886
00:35:19,096 --> 00:35:20,016
Rong took great care of me

887
00:35:20,016 --> 00:35:20,976
and was very nice to me.

888
00:35:21,215 --> 00:35:21,855
Yes.

889
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,415
I am grateful for that.

890
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:24,536
However,

891
00:35:25,936 --> 00:35:27,136
you have to be cautious.

892
00:35:28,496 --> 00:35:30,496
Alright, I know.

893
00:35:30,656 --> 00:35:31,255
Let's go.

894
00:35:37,295 --> 00:35:38,016
Qingshi,

895
00:35:38,335 --> 00:35:39,496
take Ji Rong and go ahead first.

896
00:35:40,136 --> 00:35:40,735
Okay.

897
00:35:41,215 --> 00:35:42,496
Rong, let's go first.

898
00:35:47,375 --> 00:35:48,295
Take care.

899
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:52,936
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong San,

900
00:35:53,096 --> 00:35:54,255
with Ji Rong's unknown origins,

901
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:55,415
I can't be at ease

902
00:35:55,415 --> 00:35:56,616
if she stays with Qingshi.

903
00:35:56,815 --> 00:35:58,136
But we have no evidence

904
00:35:58,295 --> 00:35:59,536
and I'm afraid Qingshi would be unhappy.

905
00:35:59,695 --> 00:36:01,096
During the time I'm not here,

906
00:36:01,335 --> 00:36:02,496
please

907
00:36:03,056 --> 00:36:03,976
keep an eye on him.

908
00:36:04,096 --> 00:36:05,855
Shi is young and naive.

909
00:36:06,255 --> 00:36:07,456
Indeed, he will be used

910
00:36:07,536 --> 00:36:08,456
or tempted easily.

911
00:36:08,815 --> 00:36:09,895
But you don't have to worry.

912
00:36:09,895 --> 00:36:10,536
As we're here,

913
00:36:10,656 --> 00:36:11,335
nothing will happen.

914
00:36:11,576 --> 00:36:12,456
Rest assured.

915
00:36:14,176 --> 00:36:14,775
Let's go.

916
00:36:15,735 --> 00:36:16,335
Let's go.

917
00:36:25,775 --> 00:36:26,936
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong San,

918
00:36:27,136 --> 00:36:28,096
it's getting late.

919
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:29,295
Let's hurry on our way.

920
00:36:29,456 --> 00:36:30,096
Alright.

921
00:36:30,976 --> 00:36:31,656
Let's go.

922
00:36:47,695 --> 00:36:48,255
Rong.

923
00:36:50,456 --> 00:36:51,136
Rong.

924
00:36:51,936 --> 00:36:53,255
Rong, are you alright?

925
00:36:54,656 --> 00:36:55,695
Come on, take care.

926
00:36:57,016 --> 00:36:58,456
Here, let me carry you first.

927
00:37:11,656 --> 00:37:12,496
Is this the place?

928
00:37:13,815 --> 00:37:14,536
Fortunately,

929
00:37:14,735 --> 00:37:16,016
the injury isn't too severe.

930
00:37:16,096 --> 00:37:17,656
It just needs some time to heal.

931
00:37:18,176 --> 00:37:19,375
Then as I can't ride a horse,

932
00:37:19,496 --> 00:37:20,656
how can I go back?

933
00:37:20,815 --> 00:37:22,016
Don't go back for now.

934
00:37:22,176 --> 00:37:23,335
Stay at Snow Stone Fort now

935
00:37:23,496 --> 00:37:24,656
and leave after your injury heals.

936
00:37:25,735 --> 00:37:26,375
Uncle Zong,

937
00:37:26,415 --> 00:37:27,255
do you have medicine?

938
00:37:27,255 --> 00:37:27,855
Yes.

939
00:37:29,855 --> 00:37:30,496
Thank you.

940
00:37:39,775 --> 00:37:40,335
Xueying.

941
00:37:40,415 --> 00:37:41,176
Xueying.

942
00:37:41,335 --> 00:37:42,335
Xueying,

943
00:37:42,335 --> 00:37:43,496
I knew you were still alive.

944
00:37:43,656 --> 00:37:44,255
Don't worry.

945
00:37:44,335 --> 00:37:45,335
I'm not that easy to die.

946
00:37:49,255 --> 00:37:50,976
I thought I would never see you again.

947
00:37:51,136 --> 00:37:52,295
You really have great fortune.

948
00:37:52,456 --> 00:37:53,936
You could survive
after falling off the Black Wind Cliff.

949
00:37:54,096 --> 00:37:55,616
You must have had
a very special experience.

950
00:37:57,136 --> 00:37:58,456
For the things we went through,

951
00:37:58,576 --> 00:37:59,815
I'll tell you in detail later.

952
00:38:00,255 --> 00:38:01,976
By the way, I heard from Kong Hao

953
00:38:02,136 --> 00:38:03,616
that you guys went to investigate
the Bloodshed Weapons.

954
00:38:03,775 --> 00:38:04,456
What's the situation?

955
00:38:05,295 --> 00:38:06,375
It was quite thrilling.

956
00:38:06,375 --> 00:38:07,335
Let me tell you.

957
00:38:14,976 --> 00:38:15,695
Moyang Chen

958
00:38:15,695 --> 00:38:17,295
actually practiced demonic techniques

959
00:38:17,695 --> 00:38:19,096
and joined the Demon Clan.

960
00:38:19,335 --> 00:38:20,056
He Yuan,

961
00:38:20,335 --> 00:38:22,016
do you see it now?

962
00:38:22,496 --> 00:38:24,016
I told you to get rid of him back then

963
00:38:24,016 --> 00:38:25,096
to avoid future troubles,

964
00:38:25,255 --> 00:38:26,215
but you wouldn't listen.

965
00:38:26,375 --> 00:38:26,976
Look.

966
00:38:27,735 --> 00:38:29,255
If all these things

967
00:38:29,255 --> 00:38:30,775
are related to this evil creature,

968
00:38:30,895 --> 00:38:32,176
let's see how you'll handle it.

969
00:38:33,775 --> 00:38:35,375
If it hadn't been
for your kindness back then,

970
00:38:35,496 --> 00:38:36,096
Moyang Chen

971
00:38:36,096 --> 00:38:37,496
wouldn't even have a chance to live now.

972
00:38:38,335 --> 00:38:40,255
(This time, I must)

973
00:38:40,255 --> 00:38:42,056
(kill this beast with my own hands.)

974
00:38:43,335 --> 00:38:44,295
Moyang Chen.

975
00:38:45,375 --> 00:38:46,735
I spared your life back then,

976
00:38:46,895 --> 00:38:48,215
but you have no regrets

977
00:38:48,415 --> 00:38:49,456
and even practiced demonic techniques,

978
00:38:49,456 --> 00:38:50,735
betraying the Xia Clan.

979
00:38:51,176 --> 00:38:51,855
You

980
00:38:52,215 --> 00:38:53,976
are already guilty of death.

981
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:55,136
Master He,

982
00:38:56,136 --> 00:38:57,176
you weren't

983
00:38:57,375 --> 00:38:59,295
like this before.

984
00:38:59,656 --> 00:39:01,936
The one who betrayed
the Xia Clan is not me.

985
00:39:02,895 --> 00:39:03,976
It's him.

986
00:39:06,415 --> 00:39:08,335
When I found out
he practiced demonic techniques

987
00:39:08,415 --> 00:39:11,255
to join the Demon Clan
at Leichao Sea Cliff,

988
00:39:11,656 --> 00:39:12,415
I immediately

989
00:39:12,415 --> 00:39:13,616
caught him and brought him back.

990
00:39:13,855 --> 00:39:15,255
These people
who practice demonic techniques

991
00:39:15,255 --> 00:39:16,456
are truly terrifying

992
00:39:16,456 --> 00:39:19,016
and have no regrets at all.

993
00:39:19,176 --> 00:39:19,976
Now,

994
00:39:20,136 --> 00:39:22,215
he has confessed to all his crimes.

995
00:39:22,656 --> 00:39:23,775
Master He,

996
00:39:23,936 --> 00:39:25,456
since you are here today,

997
00:39:25,895 --> 00:39:27,536
what about being a witness

998
00:39:28,775 --> 00:39:32,176
as I personally eliminate this traitor?

999
00:39:38,295 --> 00:39:40,576
The almighty Demon God

1000
00:39:41,536 --> 00:39:43,976
will reshape my body for me.

1001
00:39:56,815 --> 00:39:57,496
Master,

1002
00:39:57,855 --> 00:39:59,335
there's no other way now.

1003
00:39:59,335 --> 00:40:00,616
I'm willing to bear all this

1004
00:40:00,855 --> 00:40:01,735
to protect you.

1005
00:40:09,136 --> 00:40:09,976
Why did you

1006
00:40:09,976 --> 00:40:11,375
imprison Moyang Yu

1007
00:40:11,415 --> 00:40:12,536
at Leichao Sea Cliff?

1008
00:40:13,136 --> 00:40:14,496
Moyang Yu

1009
00:40:15,096 --> 00:40:17,176
escaped the arranged marriage

1010
00:40:17,176 --> 00:40:18,815
and eloped with someone else.

1011
00:40:19,176 --> 00:40:22,735
This is against the family rules.

1012
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:23,976
The Moyang family

1013
00:40:23,976 --> 00:40:25,456
has passed on for so many years

1014
00:40:25,576 --> 00:40:27,936
just by the family rules.

1015
00:40:28,536 --> 00:40:30,656
If someone breaks the family rules,

1016
00:40:30,775 --> 00:40:32,016
they must be punished.

1017
00:40:32,456 --> 00:40:33,456
Master He,

1018
00:40:33,855 --> 00:40:34,616
do you really

1019
00:40:34,616 --> 00:40:36,695
want to interfere with

1020
00:40:36,936 --> 00:40:38,895
our Moyang family's affairs?

1021
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:49,255
To become the first in the world,

1022
00:40:49,415 --> 00:40:51,176
you can't achieve it
by any means necessary.

1023
00:40:51,375 --> 00:40:52,735
You secretly
practiced demonic techniques,

1024
00:40:52,895 --> 00:40:54,176
which shamed the faction.

1025
00:40:54,496 --> 00:40:55,375
Guards!

1026
00:40:55,936 --> 00:40:57,255
Drive him out.

1027
00:40:57,775 --> 00:40:58,815
Never

1028
00:40:59,056 --> 00:41:01,335
allow him to step into
the Black White Deity Mountain again.

1029
00:41:02,136 --> 00:41:03,255
Master!

1030
00:41:03,375 --> 00:41:05,215
How ruthless you are.

1031
00:41:05,335 --> 00:41:07,895
Master!

1032
00:41:09,136 --> 00:41:10,295
(He Yuan,)

1033
00:41:10,695 --> 00:41:12,695
(you drove me out
of the faction back then)

1034
00:41:12,855 --> 00:41:14,536
(and now you got
Silver Armored Warrior killed.)

1035
00:41:14,695 --> 00:41:15,496
(I will definitely)

1036
00:41:15,656 --> 00:41:17,096
(avenge it sooner or later.)

1037
00:41:18,215 --> 00:41:18,895
From what you just mentioned

1038
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:19,936
about the situation
at Leichao Sea Cliff,

1039
00:41:20,136 --> 00:41:21,335
I've got a general understanding.

1040
00:41:21,536 --> 00:41:22,536
I've been in there before

1041
00:41:22,775 --> 00:41:23,775
and I'm quite confident

1042
00:41:23,775 --> 00:41:24,815
in dealing with the formation spells

1043
00:41:25,096 --> 00:41:26,415
and the guards there.

1044
00:41:26,936 --> 00:41:28,016
Xueying,

1045
00:41:28,096 --> 00:41:28,735
I just found out

1046
00:41:28,735 --> 00:41:30,136
that was your mother.

1047
00:41:30,255 --> 00:41:31,215
We've been there once

1048
00:41:31,215 --> 00:41:32,056
and have some experience.

1049
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:33,616
Let us go with you.

1050
00:41:34,176 --> 00:41:35,936
No. It's too dangerous.

1051
00:41:36,136 --> 00:41:38,136
Xueying, let me go with you.

1052
00:41:38,255 --> 00:41:39,415
If you go alone,

1053
00:41:39,415 --> 00:41:40,456
I'll be worried about you.

1054
00:41:41,496 --> 00:41:42,775
