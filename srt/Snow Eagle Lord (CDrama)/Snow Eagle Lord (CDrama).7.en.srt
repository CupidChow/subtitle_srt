21
00:01:58,362 --> 00:02:00,642
How come the weapon books in the library

22
00:02:00,761 --> 00:02:01,802
don't have any records?

23
00:02:12,472 --> 00:02:14,584
(Formation Spells of
Dragon Mountain Empire, Part I)

24
00:02:24,681 --> 00:02:25,202
Jingqiu,

25
00:02:27,161 --> 00:02:28,042
where are you going?

26
00:02:28,762 --> 00:02:29,642
I...

27
00:02:30,561 --> 00:02:32,602
What's wrong?
You seem to have a load on your mind.

28
00:02:32,802 --> 00:02:33,681
It seems I lost something

29
00:02:33,802 --> 00:02:34,961
very important,

30
00:02:35,082 --> 00:02:35,961
but I can't remember

31
00:02:36,082 --> 00:02:37,121
where I lost it.

32
00:02:37,681 --> 00:02:39,042
Well, when you remember,

33
00:02:39,202 --> 00:02:40,121
I'll go with you to find it.

34
00:02:41,242 --> 00:02:41,881
Okay.

35
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:42,881
By the way,

36
00:02:43,161 --> 00:02:44,642
I just practiced with Situ Hong

37
00:02:45,082 --> 00:02:46,602
and my spear technique has improved.

38
00:02:46,762 --> 00:02:49,082
It's now called
Changfeng Flying Snow Spear Technique.

39
00:02:49,522 --> 00:02:51,161
You practiced with Situ Hong?

40
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:52,802
His martial arts skills are good,

41
00:02:52,961 --> 00:02:53,881
and he is not as arrogant

42
00:02:54,001 --> 00:02:55,082
as he looks.

43
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:56,602
Okay,

44
00:02:56,632 --> 00:02:57,522
then let me see

45
00:02:57,522 --> 00:02:58,922
the results
of what you have just practiced.

46
00:02:58,922 --> 00:02:59,642
Let's go.

47
00:03:00,242 --> 00:03:00,841
Let's go.

48
00:03:03,922 --> 00:03:05,082
If I go there,

49
00:03:05,242 --> 00:03:06,561
I'll definitely
make a fool of myself again.

50
00:03:11,242 --> 00:03:11,881
No way.

51
00:03:14,001 --> 00:03:15,401
When Yu Jingqiu comes back later,

52
00:03:15,522 --> 00:03:16,961
I'll have to ask her.

53
00:03:21,642 --> 00:03:22,961
I'll ask her first

54
00:03:23,082 --> 00:03:24,121
if she was

55
00:03:24,242 --> 00:03:24,961
with Xueying.

56
00:03:25,441 --> 00:03:27,121
She'll definitely deny it.

57
00:03:27,522 --> 00:03:29,362
Then I can nail her lie

58
00:03:29,482 --> 00:03:31,401
to see if she feels guilty.

59
00:03:32,401 --> 00:03:33,121
Perfect.

60
00:03:39,322 --> 00:03:40,322
Yu Jingqiu.

61
00:03:41,441 --> 00:03:42,161
What's up?

62
00:03:44,602 --> 00:03:46,322
I just went to the Orchid & Bamboo Yard.

63
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:47,642
Dongbo Xueying wasn't there.

64
00:03:47,802 --> 00:03:48,961
I came back to the Flower Pavilion.

65
00:03:48,961 --> 00:03:49,762
You weren't here, either.

66
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:51,681
Were you two together?

67
00:03:52,242 --> 00:03:52,961
Yes.

68
00:03:53,042 --> 00:03:53,922
You're lying.

69
00:03:54,001 --> 00:03:54,881
I clearly saw you

70
00:03:54,881 --> 00:03:55,762
at the Practice Field.

71
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:03,161
Why aren't you sticking to the script?

72
00:04:03,322 --> 00:04:05,042
Why are you asking if you already saw?

73
00:04:05,322 --> 00:04:06,001
Well,

74
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,922
can't I ask?

75
00:04:10,642 --> 00:04:12,161
Now you can be sure.

76
00:04:17,201 --> 00:04:18,681
(I lost this round.)

77
00:04:18,881 --> 00:04:20,482
(I didn't expect Yu Jingqiu
to be so straightforward,)

78
00:04:20,641 --> 00:04:21,842
(not even bothering to hide it.)

79
00:04:22,001 --> 00:04:23,081
(Shi is really not simple.)

80
00:04:23,362 --> 00:04:25,201
(I need to learn from this.)

81
00:04:27,001 --> 00:04:28,321
In today's class,

82
00:04:28,441 --> 00:04:29,321
please show

83
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:30,802
your own unique skills.

84
00:04:30,922 --> 00:04:31,881
This will make it easier

85
00:04:32,042 --> 00:04:32,641
for me

86
00:04:32,761 --> 00:04:33,681
to know your characteristics.

87
00:04:55,602 --> 00:04:56,602
So beautiful.

88
00:04:56,761 --> 00:04:58,001
Xueying is so amazing!

89
00:04:58,162 --> 00:04:59,482
What's so great about that?

90
00:05:01,881 --> 00:05:02,881
Incredible!

91
00:05:09,402 --> 00:05:11,561
- So amazing!
- Really amazing!

92
00:05:24,722 --> 00:05:25,402
This

93
00:05:26,001 --> 00:05:27,201
is even more beautiful.

94
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:32,216
She is Yu Jingqiu

95
00:05:32,216 --> 00:05:33,081
from Water Daoist Temple.

96
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,482
Her magic is indeed impressive.

97
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:35,722
She is not only good at martial arts

98
00:05:35,761 --> 00:05:36,761
but also beautiful.

99
00:05:36,842 --> 00:05:38,561
An ethereal beauty indeed.

100
00:05:40,001 --> 00:05:40,681
Not bad.

101
00:05:41,121 --> 00:05:42,162
Are there any other students

102
00:05:42,321 --> 00:05:43,402
who want to show their techniques?

103
00:05:46,722 --> 00:05:47,362
Miss,

104
00:05:47,641 --> 00:05:48,521
although I don't know

105
00:05:48,521 --> 00:05:49,681
any martial arts moves,

106
00:05:49,842 --> 00:05:50,521
I have developed

107
00:05:50,521 --> 00:05:51,722
the Flying Seal.

108
00:05:51,881 --> 00:05:53,201
Please show us.

109
00:06:12,602 --> 00:06:13,962
Not as powerful as me.

110
00:06:19,242 --> 00:06:20,962
Be careful, Kong Hao.

111
00:06:26,321 --> 00:06:27,441
Look at him.

112
00:06:29,001 --> 00:06:30,242
This is what he got.

113
00:06:30,242 --> 00:06:31,162
The brother and sister
from the Kong family

114
00:06:31,162 --> 00:06:32,402
are not very good at martial arts.

115
00:06:32,402 --> 00:06:33,162
How did they get enrolled?

116
00:06:33,641 --> 00:06:34,681
They must have muddled through.

117
00:06:36,162 --> 00:06:37,482
(Although my martial arts aren't good,)

118
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,962
(I'm not a coward.)

119
00:06:39,201 --> 00:06:40,922
(I won't disgrace our Kong family.)

120
00:06:43,121 --> 00:06:44,441
Just now in the sky,

121
00:06:44,602 --> 00:06:45,722
there were a total of 1,001

122
00:06:45,922 --> 00:06:46,842
flower petals scattering.

123
00:06:47,001 --> 00:06:48,121
Each petal fell

124
00:06:48,282 --> 00:06:49,042
twenty percent faster

125
00:06:49,242 --> 00:06:50,561
than the previous.

126
00:06:51,441 --> 00:06:52,922
Youyue, that's amazing!

127
00:06:52,922 --> 00:06:53,881
How did you calculate that?

128
00:06:54,242 --> 00:06:55,121
My sister has been

129
00:06:55,121 --> 00:06:56,362
exceptionally good at mental arithmetic
since she was little.

130
00:06:56,641 --> 00:06:57,802
Our family's accountant

131
00:06:57,802 --> 00:06:59,121
couldn't even beat her with an abacus.

132
00:06:59,242 --> 00:07:00,362
With this unique skill,

133
00:07:00,482 --> 00:07:02,162
you can practice
the Inner Sight Technique in the future.

134
00:07:02,402 --> 00:07:03,842
Through internal observation practice,

135
00:07:04,042 --> 00:07:04,922
you can see the directions

136
00:07:05,081 --> 00:07:06,162
of the enemy's attack.

137
00:07:06,321 --> 00:07:08,121
In this way, you can calculate
their attack speed

138
00:07:08,282 --> 00:07:09,521
and the time it takes
for their moves to fall.

139
00:07:09,681 --> 00:07:10,761
You can assist
your teammates in attacking.

140
00:07:10,922 --> 00:07:12,282
There's such a skill?

141
00:07:12,641 --> 00:07:13,922
That's great!

142
00:07:14,121 --> 00:07:14,802
In the future,

143
00:07:14,962 --> 00:07:16,482
I can also practice
an unparalleled skill.

144
00:07:23,441 --> 00:07:24,521
Miss, please look at mine.

145
00:07:51,681 --> 00:07:52,441
So fast!

146
00:07:53,761 --> 00:07:54,881
Look at your martial arts.

147
00:07:55,042 --> 00:07:55,922
You observe and I run.

148
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,761
We'd make a suitable team.

149
00:07:58,362 --> 00:07:59,641
Who wants to be in a team with you?

150
00:08:01,962 --> 00:08:04,201
Alright, it's my turn.

151
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:06,561
I'll begin then.

152
00:08:06,722 --> 00:08:07,842
Let me show you

153
00:08:07,842 --> 00:08:09,282
our Si Family's unique skill.

154
00:08:26,001 --> 00:08:27,402
I didn't know it before.

155
00:08:34,001 --> 00:08:35,281
This is nothing.

156
00:08:35,562 --> 00:08:36,641
To represent

157
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:38,082
our Si family's level,

158
00:08:38,281 --> 00:08:39,401
it has to be my brother.

159
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:40,722
Brother,

160
00:08:41,801 --> 00:08:42,562
please.

161
00:08:42,722 --> 00:08:43,602
Go. Go.

162
00:08:43,761 --> 00:08:44,362
Yes, go.

163
00:08:44,362 --> 00:08:45,362
Go show us.

164
00:08:45,362 --> 00:08:46,041
Hurry up.

165
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:49,921
I don't really have

166
00:08:50,082 --> 00:08:51,041
any unique skills.

167
00:08:51,761 --> 00:08:53,482
But before coming to Changfeng Academy,

168
00:08:53,602 --> 00:08:54,881
I had doubts in my heart.

169
00:08:55,521 --> 00:08:57,602
I wanted to know how big the gap is

170
00:08:57,921 --> 00:09:00,442
between my skills and my master's.

171
00:09:00,921 --> 00:09:02,001
May I ask

172
00:09:02,202 --> 00:09:03,562
Ms. Xiaoxi for guidance?

173
00:09:03,562 --> 00:09:04,161
What?

174
00:09:04,161 --> 00:09:06,202
He's challenging Master Xiaoxi.

175
00:09:06,202 --> 00:09:06,921
He is so arrogant.

176
00:09:06,921 --> 00:09:08,082
He's totally overestimating himself.

177
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:09,281
Wait and see how Master Xiaoxi

178
00:09:09,281 --> 00:09:10,842
beats him to a pulp

179
00:09:10,881 --> 00:09:12,001
and makes him see himself clearly.

180
00:09:12,041 --> 00:09:12,888
Right.

181
00:09:31,281 --> 00:09:33,041
(Ms. Xiaoxi suppressed her own Dou Qi)

182
00:09:33,161 --> 00:09:34,322
(to the Meteor Level,)

183
00:09:34,761 --> 00:09:36,881
(but she could still handle it with ease
by changing her technique.)

184
00:09:56,888 --> 00:09:58,291
(Wild Wind Blade)

185
00:10:04,088 --> 00:10:05,400
(Butterfly Wings Dance)

186
00:10:12,921 --> 00:10:13,881
That's really amazing.

187
00:10:14,482 --> 00:10:15,842
Yes, it is.

188
00:10:17,041 --> 00:10:19,041
Thank you for showing mercy.

189
00:10:19,482 --> 00:10:21,082
Your basics are very solid.

190
00:10:21,242 --> 00:10:23,442
Keep practicing
and play to your strengths.

191
00:10:23,562 --> 00:10:25,722
In the future, you will
definitely make more progress.

192
00:10:26,161 --> 00:10:27,482
Thank you for your guidance.

193
00:10:27,801 --> 00:10:28,242
(I need to reach)

194
00:10:28,362 --> 00:10:29,641
(his level of cultivation)

195
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:31,482
(to be able to save my mother.)

196
00:10:32,121 --> 00:10:33,602
(I'm far from that level right now.)

197
00:10:33,921 --> 00:10:35,041
(I need to work twice as hard.)

198
00:10:35,401 --> 00:10:36,242
Everyone's

199
00:10:36,242 --> 00:10:37,442
martial arts starting point
is different.

200
00:10:37,602 --> 00:10:39,121
Some are powerful, and others are weak.

201
00:10:39,401 --> 00:10:40,921
Some students

202
00:10:41,121 --> 00:10:41,641
already have

203
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:43,121
a solid foundation
in martial arts at a young age.

204
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,682
While some other students

205
00:10:44,842 --> 00:10:46,442
haven't even started
learning martial arts.

206
00:10:46,801 --> 00:10:47,442
But as long as you

207
00:10:47,562 --> 00:10:48,842
enter Changfeng Academy

208
00:10:49,001 --> 00:10:50,281
and practice diligently,

209
00:10:50,401 --> 00:10:51,161
you will definitely find

210
00:10:51,281 --> 00:10:52,442
your own martial arts characteristics

211
00:10:52,602 --> 00:10:53,682
and practicing methods.

212
00:10:53,881 --> 00:10:55,281
As long as you stay humble and patient

213
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,281
and practice seriously,

214
00:10:56,442 --> 00:10:57,082
in the future,

215
00:10:57,281 --> 00:10:57,962
you will definitely break through

216
00:10:58,121 --> 00:10:59,322
your martial arts goals.

217
00:10:59,521 --> 00:11:00,401
So, that's all

218
00:11:00,562 --> 00:11:01,401
for today's class.

219
00:11:01,761 --> 00:11:03,521
Thank you, Miss.

220
00:11:10,161 --> 00:11:11,202
Is Kong Hao here?

221
00:11:12,082 --> 00:11:13,121
Sister?

222
00:11:13,602 --> 00:11:15,521
Why do you come to the boys' dormitory?

223
00:11:15,921 --> 00:11:16,921
Well,

224
00:11:17,121 --> 00:11:18,602
I just came to see

225
00:11:18,722 --> 00:11:20,121
if you have any clothes to wash.

226
00:11:20,281 --> 00:11:21,801
No way, sister.

227
00:11:21,962 --> 00:11:23,682
Pigs are flying today?

228
00:11:23,842 --> 00:11:25,001
This is the first time in over a decade

229
00:11:25,161 --> 00:11:27,242
that you've taken the initiative
to do my laundry.

230
00:11:27,401 --> 00:11:28,801
You must have a fever.

231
00:11:29,682 --> 00:11:30,801
Nonsense.

232
00:11:30,921 --> 00:11:32,362
There is someone

233
00:11:32,362 --> 00:11:33,482
to take care of you at home before.

234
00:11:33,682 --> 00:11:35,602
But now we're at Changfeng Academy.

235
00:11:35,801 --> 00:11:37,482
If I don't take care of you, who will?

236
00:11:37,962 --> 00:11:38,921
Besides,

237
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:41,482
having such a gentle
and virtuous sister

238
00:11:41,641 --> 00:11:43,041
who is good at taking care of others,

239
00:11:43,842 --> 00:11:45,801
you should count yourself lucky.

240
00:11:47,682 --> 00:11:48,722
Xueying,

241
00:11:48,881 --> 00:11:50,401
do you have any clothes to wash?

242
00:11:50,521 --> 00:11:51,881
I can help wash yours, too.

243
00:11:52,041 --> 00:11:53,401
No, thank you.

244
00:11:54,242 --> 00:11:55,082
Xueying,

245
00:11:55,281 --> 00:11:57,001
you're so hardworking, still reading.

246
00:11:57,082 --> 00:11:58,041
With the intensity

247
00:11:58,242 --> 00:11:58,842
of our training now,

248
00:11:59,041 --> 00:12:00,442
you must take care of your health.

249
00:12:00,442 --> 00:12:01,161
I will.

250
00:12:01,322 --> 00:12:02,722
Thank you for your concern.

251
00:12:03,562 --> 00:12:04,322
Youyue.

252
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:05,281
Well,

253
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:07,121
Xueying doesn't have clothes to wash,

254
00:12:07,121 --> 00:12:07,881
but I do.

255
00:12:09,322 --> 00:12:11,682
You don't mind washing one more, do you?

256
00:12:13,161 --> 00:12:14,881
Of course, I don't mind.

257
00:12:14,881 --> 00:12:16,442
Sister, I see.

258
00:12:16,521 --> 00:12:17,161
This is

259
00:12:17,161 --> 00:12:19,001
not about the laundry.

260
00:12:19,121 --> 00:12:20,602
You know too much.

261
00:12:21,801 --> 00:12:23,161
Now I know what they call

262
00:12:23,161 --> 00:12:24,682
losing more than you gain.

263
00:12:25,202 --> 00:12:26,322
So unlucky.

264
00:12:27,682 --> 00:12:29,041
Thank you, Youyue.

265
00:12:48,161 --> 00:12:49,281
Xueying,

266
00:12:49,281 --> 00:12:50,041
you and Jingqiu

267
00:12:50,041 --> 00:12:51,082
have been practicing for so long.

268
00:12:51,082 --> 00:12:52,521
How about you practicing with me?

269
00:12:52,881 --> 00:12:53,842
Youyue,

270
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,521
you haven't mastered the basics yet.

271
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:56,602
How do you know

272
00:12:56,602 --> 00:12:57,761
if you don't try?

273
00:13:10,442 --> 00:13:11,362
So,

274
00:13:11,602 --> 00:13:12,921
you still need to master the basics.

275
00:13:12,921 --> 00:13:14,001
Once you've mastered the basics,

276
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:15,242
feel free to come to us for practice.

277
00:13:26,001 --> 00:13:26,641
Sister,

278
00:13:26,761 --> 00:13:28,482
your competitor is strong.

279
00:13:28,482 --> 00:13:29,682
You have to go for it.

280
00:13:30,401 --> 00:13:31,121
Kong Hao,

281
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:33,001
do you want me
to tell our father right now

282
00:13:33,202 --> 00:13:33,842
that

283
00:13:33,921 --> 00:13:35,521
you've gained insight
at Changfeng Academy

284
00:13:35,562 --> 00:13:37,281
and have him bring you back
to take over the family business?

285
00:13:37,281 --> 00:13:38,921
I was wrong. I was wrong.

286
00:13:38,921 --> 00:13:39,801
I was wrong, Sister.

287
00:13:42,682 --> 00:13:43,602
Youyue,

288
00:13:43,801 --> 00:13:45,202
you're actually quite impressive.

289
00:13:45,322 --> 00:13:46,082
How about this?

290
00:13:46,082 --> 00:13:47,001
I'll practice with you.

291
00:13:56,281 --> 00:13:57,121
Here are some flowers for you.

292
00:13:59,722 --> 00:14:01,842
So embarrassed.

293
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:02,722
People say

294
00:14:02,722 --> 00:14:03,602
girls like flowers.

295
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:04,362
Look how nice the flowers are.

296
00:14:04,362 --> 00:14:05,482
I picked them for you myself.

297
00:14:06,161 --> 00:14:07,641
Having some flowers will
make you a bit happier.

298
00:14:08,401 --> 00:14:09,362
Puyang Bo,

299
00:14:09,562 --> 00:14:10,322
let me ask you.

300
00:14:10,641 --> 00:14:12,602
If you could only choose one between

301
00:14:12,602 --> 00:14:13,842
Yu Jingqiu and me,

302
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,001
who would you choose?

303
00:14:18,921 --> 00:14:20,682
Well, for this question,

304
00:14:21,602 --> 00:14:22,482
if it is

305
00:14:22,482 --> 00:14:23,722
about high martial arts skills,

306
00:14:23,722 --> 00:14:25,682
it would definitely be Jingqiu.

307
00:14:28,682 --> 00:14:29,682
But if it's about

308
00:14:29,682 --> 00:14:30,801
who makes better soup,

309
00:14:30,801 --> 00:14:32,281
it would be you, Youyue.

310
00:14:35,962 --> 00:14:38,562
But Xueying

311
00:14:38,761 --> 00:14:42,322
likes those with high martial arts skills
and great abilities.

312
00:14:44,161 --> 00:14:45,041
Well, liking

313
00:14:45,041 --> 00:14:46,202
can be changed.

314
00:14:46,482 --> 00:14:48,281
You cook him some delicious food,

315
00:14:48,362 --> 00:14:49,801
and maybe you'll win his heart.

316
00:14:50,442 --> 00:14:52,082
He's not like you.

317
00:14:52,082 --> 00:14:53,362
It's the same for everyone.

318
00:14:53,521 --> 00:14:55,161
The love and pursuit of good food

319
00:14:55,161 --> 00:14:56,362
are instinctive.

320
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:57,121
So

321
00:14:57,362 --> 00:14:59,281
as long as you can satisfy his stomach,

322
00:14:59,401 --> 00:15:01,202
you'll have won half of his heart.

323
00:15:01,482 --> 00:15:02,842
Satisfy his stomach?

324
00:15:03,801 --> 00:15:04,761
You make it sound like

325
00:15:04,761 --> 00:15:06,202
there's some truth to that.

326
00:15:06,562 --> 00:15:08,121
I noticed Xueying's meals

327
00:15:08,121 --> 00:15:09,401
were quite plain before.

328
00:15:09,801 --> 00:15:11,401
I should cook something delicious

329
00:15:11,401 --> 00:15:12,202
to nourish him.

330
00:15:12,962 --> 00:15:14,242
Delicious food?

331
00:15:15,562 --> 00:15:17,602
But you don't know

332
00:15:17,602 --> 00:15:18,962
what Xueying likes to eat, do you?

333
00:15:19,161 --> 00:15:20,682
Of course I don't know.

334
00:15:20,881 --> 00:15:21,801
Aren't you living close

335
00:15:21,801 --> 00:15:22,562
to Xueying?

336
00:15:23,521 --> 00:15:24,442
Tell me a little about it.

337
00:15:24,722 --> 00:15:26,401
He loves spicy pork kidney,

338
00:15:26,401 --> 00:15:27,121
lettuce with sesame paste,

339
00:15:27,121 --> 00:15:28,001
steamed duck with ginkgo,

340
00:15:28,001 --> 00:15:28,216
and...

341
00:15:28,216 --> 00:15:29,112
Wait, wait.

342
00:15:29,112 --> 00:15:31,121
Spicy pork kidney,
lettuce with sesame paste, and...

343
00:15:31,121 --> 00:15:32,041
Steamed duck with ginkgo

344
00:15:32,121 --> 00:15:34,082
and braised ribs. Braised ribs.

345
00:15:34,082 --> 00:15:34,682
Yes.

346
00:15:34,682 --> 00:15:36,362
Xueying loves braised ribs the most.

347
00:15:36,921 --> 00:15:39,001
Braised ribs?

348
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,521
I think I've seen

349
00:15:40,521 --> 00:15:42,322
our servants cook this dish before.

350
00:15:43,161 --> 00:15:44,121
How about this?

351
00:15:45,521 --> 00:15:47,482
Puyang Bo, you run fast.

352
00:15:47,521 --> 00:15:49,322
Help me buy some ribs,

353
00:15:49,401 --> 00:15:50,082
and we'll give it a try.

354
00:15:51,288 --> 00:15:51,832
Alright.

355
00:15:54,202 --> 00:15:56,121
Braised ribs.

356
00:15:59,881 --> 00:16:00,962
It seems to be done.

357
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:01,722
Can we open it now?

358
00:16:01,722 --> 00:16:02,881
It does smell good.

359
00:16:03,761 --> 00:16:04,881
Hurry up and open it,
or it'll be overcooked.

360
00:16:04,881 --> 00:16:05,881
It won't taste good then.

361
00:16:08,722 --> 00:16:10,322
I mean, if you overcook it,

362
00:16:10,322 --> 00:16:11,761
Xueying won't like it.

363
00:16:11,801 --> 00:16:12,442
Right?

364
00:16:13,112 --> 00:16:14,001
Okay, okay.

365
00:16:19,362 --> 00:16:20,801
This smells really good.

366
00:16:20,881 --> 00:16:21,962
Let me try a piece.

367
00:16:26,242 --> 00:16:28,121
How is it? Is it delicious?

368
00:16:32,881 --> 00:16:33,881
Why do I feel like

369
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,482
it's a bit bland?

370
00:16:36,041 --> 00:16:37,322
Did you forget to add salt?

371
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:38,682
No way.

372
00:16:38,722 --> 00:16:39,842
I'll add some more then.

373
00:16:40,001 --> 00:16:41,442
It's my first time cooking ribs.

374
00:16:41,521 --> 00:16:42,881
- I'll add some.
- No, no. Wait.

375
00:16:43,641 --> 00:16:45,442
That piece had less seasoning.

376
00:16:45,442 --> 00:16:46,362
Let me try this side.

377
00:16:46,761 --> 00:16:47,562
You try it.

378
00:16:52,641 --> 00:16:54,602
Still not delicious enough?

379
00:16:57,921 --> 00:16:59,881
Could it be that I have no talent?

380
00:17:05,122 --> 00:17:07,122
Is it delicious now?

381
00:17:07,202 --> 00:17:08,122
Almost there.

382
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:10,162
You can give it to Xueying now.

383
00:17:10,162 --> 00:17:11,001
Really good.

384
00:17:16,041 --> 00:17:17,882
Puyang Bo!

385
00:17:18,962 --> 00:17:19,642
I...

386
00:17:19,882 --> 00:17:20,682
Youyue,

387
00:17:20,824 --> 00:17:22,680
the last piece is
the best part of the meat.

388
00:17:22,680 --> 00:17:23,576
Keep it for Xueying.

389
00:17:23,576 --> 00:17:24,482
Tasting food isn't easy.

390
00:17:24,482 --> 00:17:25,361
I'll beat you to death!

391
00:17:25,592 --> 00:17:26,136
Beat you to death!

392
00:17:26,136 --> 00:17:27,281
Slow down! No!

393
00:17:27,281 --> 00:17:28,041
Stop right there!

394
00:17:28,041 --> 00:17:29,561
I really was helping Xueying.

395
00:17:29,722 --> 00:17:30,561
Stop!

396
00:17:32,281 --> 00:17:33,081
Brother,

397
00:17:33,202 --> 00:17:35,242
Changfeng Academy is so boring.

398
00:17:35,242 --> 00:17:36,682
All we do is practicing martial arts.

399
00:17:37,321 --> 00:17:38,882
Why don't we find a time

400
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:40,242
to sneak out and have some fun?

401
00:17:40,632 --> 00:17:41,521
Borong,

402
00:17:42,041 --> 00:17:43,682
you're not a child anymore.

403
00:17:44,162 --> 00:17:45,722
After coming to Changfeng Academy,

404
00:17:46,122 --> 00:17:48,361
you should focus more
and practice martial arts diligently.

405
00:17:48,882 --> 00:17:50,561
Otherwise, how will you protect
the Si Mansion in the future

406
00:17:50,841 --> 00:17:51,682
and become

407
00:17:51,682 --> 00:17:53,402
a truly useful person
in Dragon Mountain Empire?

408
00:17:53,601 --> 00:17:54,922
I know, Brother.

409
00:17:55,162 --> 00:17:56,361
Don't always lecture me

410
00:17:56,361 --> 00:17:57,361
with these principles.

411
00:17:57,561 --> 00:17:58,962
I think my current martial arts skills

412
00:17:58,962 --> 00:18:00,162
are enough.

413
00:18:00,402 --> 00:18:01,162
Besides,

414
00:18:01,162 --> 00:18:03,001
don't I still have you and Auntie?

415
00:18:10,761 --> 00:18:11,521
Mr. Situ,

416
00:18:13,202 --> 00:18:14,801
I have a question for you.

417
00:18:15,122 --> 00:18:16,162
We're all fellow disciples.

418
00:18:16,242 --> 00:18:17,321
No need to be so polite.

419
00:18:17,402 --> 00:18:18,162
It's this.

420
00:18:19,242 --> 00:18:20,122
Isn't this

421
00:18:20,122 --> 00:18:21,361
the messed-up spell seal

422
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:22,081
from class?

423
00:18:22,081 --> 00:18:23,682
Why are you still carrying it with you?

424
00:18:24,001 --> 00:18:25,521
Embarrassing yourself isn't enough?

425
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:27,001
You've brought it here
to make fun of us?

426
00:18:28,521 --> 00:18:29,281
No.

427
00:18:29,442 --> 00:18:31,081
I saw Mr. Situ's excellent martial arts.

428
00:18:31,281 --> 00:18:32,601
I want him to give me some instructions

429
00:18:32,601 --> 00:18:33,521
on this flying seal.

430
00:18:42,162 --> 00:18:43,001
The power distribution

431
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:44,056
for controlling the source stone

432
00:18:44,056 --> 00:18:45,321
is not even in your Flying Seal.

433
00:18:45,442 --> 00:18:46,712
It has caused your difficulties
in controlling

434
00:18:46,712 --> 00:18:48,536
the power and direction during flight.

435
00:18:48,536 --> 00:18:49,601
If you can solve

436
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:50,402
this issue,

437
00:18:50,521 --> 00:18:51,081
it'll be a

438
00:18:51,081 --> 00:18:52,242
very nice invention.

439
00:18:54,521 --> 00:18:55,882
Thank you for your instructions.

440
00:18:56,202 --> 00:18:57,321
I knew it.

441
00:18:57,402 --> 00:18:58,361
In the whole Changfeng Academy,

442
00:18:58,361 --> 00:18:59,361
besides my brother-in-law,

443
00:18:59,442 --> 00:19:00,561
you're the best.

444
00:19:00,682 --> 00:19:01,402
Your brother-in-law?

445
00:19:01,801 --> 00:19:02,962
I mean Dongbo Xueying.

446
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:03,801
Previously,

447
00:19:03,841 --> 00:19:05,521
my sister and he
had an arranged marriage,

448
00:19:05,722 --> 00:19:06,962
but it doesn't count now.

449
00:19:07,001 --> 00:19:07,761
My sister

450
00:19:07,761 --> 00:19:09,601
is simply secretly in love with him now.

451
00:19:10,041 --> 00:19:10,841
But,

452
00:19:10,922 --> 00:19:12,281
I think Dongbo Xueying

453
00:19:12,281 --> 00:19:13,202
and Jingqiu

454
00:19:13,202 --> 00:19:14,361
are more like a couple.

455
00:19:14,722 --> 00:19:15,561
They even arranged

456
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:16,682
to practice martial arts together.

457
00:19:16,882 --> 00:19:18,402
Jingqiu and him?

458
00:19:18,682 --> 00:19:19,722
That's impossible.

459
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:20,568
It's true.

460
00:19:20,801 --> 00:19:22,761
They often practice
martial arts together.

461
00:19:23,242 --> 00:19:25,321
Isn't it just practicing
martial arts together?

462
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:26,722
You think everyone is like you?

463
00:19:26,722 --> 00:19:27,601
Being a good-for-nothing

464
00:19:27,682 --> 00:19:28,402
and only playing

465
00:19:28,402 --> 00:19:29,202
with this stuff.

466
00:19:29,242 --> 00:19:29,848
I won't talk to you anymore.

467
00:19:29,848 --> 00:19:30,841
I'm leaving first.

468
00:19:32,081 --> 00:19:33,962
Mr. Situ, I'll treat you
to a drink another day.

469
00:19:34,041 --> 00:19:34,722
Deal.

470
00:19:35,361 --> 00:19:36,242
What about me?

471
00:19:36,682 --> 00:19:37,601
Not you.

472
00:19:43,202 --> 00:19:44,242
When did

473
00:19:44,242 --> 00:19:45,442
Dongbo Xueying

474
00:19:45,442 --> 00:19:46,601
become friends with Jingqiu?

475
00:19:47,642 --> 00:19:49,482
Ever since the entrance examination,

476
00:19:49,482 --> 00:19:50,722
he's been in the spotlight.

477
00:19:51,321 --> 00:19:52,321
There are only a few female disciples

478
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,482
in Changfeng Academy.

479
00:19:54,041 --> 00:19:54,922
Now,

480
00:19:54,922 --> 00:19:56,841
both our academy beauties like him.

481
00:19:56,841 --> 00:19:57,528
Brother,

482
00:19:58,081 --> 00:19:59,442
say something.

483
00:19:59,561 --> 00:20:00,482
Are you that willing

484
00:20:00,482 --> 00:20:02,001
to see Dongbo Xueying
steal the limelight?

485
00:20:02,081 --> 00:20:03,162
In my opinion,

486
00:20:03,281 --> 00:20:04,202
Jingqiu

487
00:20:04,202 --> 00:20:05,521
should be with you.

488
00:20:05,801 --> 00:20:06,922
You two are such a perfect match.

489
00:20:06,962 --> 00:20:08,001
The man is able
and the woman is beautiful.

490
00:20:08,281 --> 00:20:10,561
As for Kong Youyue,

491
00:20:11,608 --> 00:20:13,361
I can reluctantly accept her.

492
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:15,722
Borong,

493
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,801
how can you talk like that?

494
00:20:18,242 --> 00:20:19,482
Jingqiu and I

495
00:20:19,722 --> 00:20:21,442
are just ordinary schoolmates.

496
00:20:21,682 --> 00:20:23,321
Ordinary schoolmates?

497
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:24,361
Jingqiu

498
00:20:24,361 --> 00:20:25,682
is our goddess.

499
00:20:25,922 --> 00:20:26,801
She's so wonderful.

500
00:20:27,001 --> 00:20:28,642
Aren't you interested in her?

501
00:20:29,624 --> 00:20:30,360
Brother,

502
00:20:30,744 --> 00:20:31,480
besides,

503
00:20:31,736 --> 00:20:33,402
nobody knows about the future,

504
00:20:33,402 --> 00:20:34,001
right?

505
00:20:44,722 --> 00:20:45,642
Xueying,

506
00:20:45,682 --> 00:20:47,122
you're still up so late?

507
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:47,922
Yes.

508
00:20:48,482 --> 00:20:50,561
What's on your eyes?

509
00:20:51,202 --> 00:20:52,162
Nothing.

510
00:20:52,202 --> 00:20:53,642
I didn't get a good rest last night.

511
00:20:53,642 --> 00:20:54,561
Ms. Tanshi gave me

512
00:20:54,561 --> 00:20:55,521
some new medicinal patches.

513
00:20:58,321 --> 00:20:59,761
Sister, look at this.

514
00:20:59,841 --> 00:21:00,601
What's this?

515
00:21:00,682 --> 00:21:02,922
It's a new spell seal I've developed.

516
00:21:03,122 --> 00:21:04,242
Just stick this on

517
00:21:04,402 --> 00:21:05,722
and whatever you're thinking

518
00:21:05,761 --> 00:21:07,682
can be transformed
into Dou Qi and displayed.

519
00:21:08,361 --> 00:21:10,642
If you stick this on Xueying,

520
00:21:10,722 --> 00:21:11,521
won't you know

521
00:21:11,521 --> 00:21:12,722
what he's thinking?

522
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:16,321
You're practicing
the Inner Sight Technique.

523
00:21:16,442 --> 00:21:17,482
Your eyes are especially important.

524
00:21:19,962 --> 00:21:21,321
Thank you for caring about me.

525
00:21:27,841 --> 00:21:29,281
(Flying Snow Spear?)

526
00:21:29,682 --> 00:21:30,882
(Sure enough, he is always
thinking about the spear)

527
00:21:30,882 --> 00:21:32,601
(after practicing all day.)

528
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:34,682
Xueying,

529
00:21:34,722 --> 00:21:36,402
have you gotten used

530
00:21:36,642 --> 00:21:39,122
to living at Changfeng Academy?

531
00:21:39,281 --> 00:21:40,482
There's nothing to get used to.

532
00:21:40,521 --> 00:21:41,722
Isn't it the same for everyone?

533
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:43,882
Well, how are you sleeping?

534
00:21:43,882 --> 00:21:45,321
Do you miss your family?

535
00:21:46,722 --> 00:21:47,882
Of course, I do.

536
00:21:48,162 --> 00:21:51,041
I miss Qingshi,
Uncle Tong San, Uncle Zong Ling,

537
00:21:51,361 --> 00:21:52,761
and everything
about the Xueying Territory.

538
00:21:55,202 --> 00:21:56,442
But what's the use of missing them?

539
00:21:56,722 --> 00:21:57,962
Didn't we come to Changfeng Academy

540
00:21:58,041 --> 00:21:59,642
to enhance our cultivation?

541
00:22:00,882 --> 00:22:02,402
Well, that's not why I'm here.

542
00:22:04,081 --> 00:22:05,242
I'm going back to rest first.

543
00:22:08,841 --> 00:22:09,642
What's wrong?

544
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,081
Nothing, nothing.

545
00:22:11,202 --> 00:22:12,041
Xueying,

546
00:22:12,041 --> 00:22:13,162
please go rest.

547
00:22:18,281 --> 00:22:20,962
He really doesn't have me in his heart.

548
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:39,922
On such a beautiful night,

549
00:22:40,202 --> 00:22:41,281
Youyue,

550
00:22:41,321 --> 00:22:42,841
you are enjoying the view alone.

551
00:22:43,041 --> 00:22:44,642
Isn't it a bit lonely?

552
00:22:47,122 --> 00:22:49,722
Don't waste this wonderful night.

553
00:22:50,242 --> 00:22:51,242
How about

554
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,202
I accompany you

555
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:54,642
to the back mountain to enjoy the moon?

556
00:22:56,841 --> 00:22:57,801
Si Borong,

557
00:22:57,882 --> 00:22:59,601
what are you doing
at the Flower Pavilion?

558
00:22:59,882 --> 00:23:01,081
It's none of your business.

559
00:23:01,561 --> 00:23:02,561
Youyue...

560
00:23:06,521 --> 00:23:07,722
Kong Youyue,

561
00:23:08,361 --> 00:23:09,561
you're here.

562
00:23:09,682 --> 00:23:10,242
Then,

563
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:12,321
who is she?

564
00:23:17,561 --> 00:23:19,001
I'm sorry. I got it wrong.

565
00:23:19,041 --> 00:23:20,442
Sorry, sorry.

566
00:23:20,521 --> 00:23:21,601
Weren't you going to accompany me

567
00:23:21,682 --> 00:23:23,001
to enjoy the moon at the back mountain?

568
00:23:23,001 --> 00:23:23,482
Misunderstanding.

569
00:23:23,482 --> 00:23:25,081
It's a misunderstanding.

570
00:23:25,081 --> 00:23:26,041
Let's go. Let's go.

571
00:23:26,041 --> 00:23:28,202
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding!

572
00:23:28,642 --> 00:23:30,601
Si Borong, you dare to push me?

573
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:31,722
- Don't chase me!
- Stay where you are!

574
00:23:31,722 --> 00:23:32,402
Serves you right.

575
00:23:32,801 --> 00:23:35,442
Lanxin should teach you a lesson.

576
00:23:42,402 --> 00:23:43,561
Borong,

577
00:23:43,682 --> 00:23:45,242
the moon is so round tonight.

578
00:23:45,321 --> 00:23:46,642
Let's go watch the moon.

579
00:23:49,281 --> 00:23:50,242
You'll have to watch

580
00:23:50,242 --> 00:23:51,402
the moon tonight,
whether you want to or not.

581
00:23:52,281 --> 00:23:54,841
Open the door, Si Borong!

582
00:23:54,841 --> 00:23:56,442
I-I'm going to sleep.

583
00:24:02,041 --> 00:24:03,722
(Orchid & Bamboo Yard)
Si Borong, open the door!

584
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:05,528
Open the door!

585
00:24:12,402 --> 00:24:13,081
Morning.

586
00:24:13,402 --> 00:24:14,202
Morning.

587
00:24:14,361 --> 00:24:15,402
Did you sleep well last night?

588
00:24:15,801 --> 00:24:17,081
Who can sleep as well as you?

589
00:24:17,361 --> 00:24:19,081
Snoring all the time.
It was so annoying.

590
00:24:20,361 --> 00:24:21,642
As soon as I touch the pillow,

591
00:24:21,642 --> 00:24:22,642
I start dreaming.

592
00:24:22,682 --> 00:24:23,081
Did you dream

593
00:24:23,081 --> 00:24:24,162
about being chased
by your father to the roof

594
00:24:24,162 --> 00:24:25,041
and getting beaten?

595
00:24:25,041 --> 00:24:25,561
Borong,

596
00:24:26,001 --> 00:24:26,642
let's go.

597
00:24:34,081 --> 00:24:35,761
You're up so early to practice.

598
00:24:36,081 --> 00:24:37,001
I'm used to it.

599
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,281
Look at Dongbo Xueying.

600
00:24:39,281 --> 00:24:40,402
He's always stealing the limelight.

601
00:24:40,402 --> 00:24:41,482
Practicing, practicing.

602
00:24:41,482 --> 00:24:42,361
He's the only one
in the entire Changfeng Academy

603
00:24:42,361 --> 00:24:43,801
working day and night.

604
00:24:45,801 --> 00:24:47,162
Today, what you need to learn is

605
00:24:47,321 --> 00:24:48,482
Flying on Object.

606
00:25:08,081 --> 00:25:09,482
What's so difficult about that?

607
00:25:09,601 --> 00:25:10,521
I've known how to do that
for a long time.

608
00:25:10,962 --> 00:25:12,682
In that case, Si Borong,

609
00:25:12,922 --> 00:25:14,081
please give everyone a demonstration.

610
00:25:31,640 --> 00:25:33,361
Flying on Object may seem simple,

611
00:25:33,361 --> 00:25:34,081
but achieving

612
00:25:34,162 --> 00:25:35,122
stable control

613
00:25:35,122 --> 00:25:36,561
in changing air currents

614
00:25:36,561 --> 00:25:37,601
is not easy.

615
00:25:38,321 --> 00:25:39,081
During flight,

616
00:25:39,202 --> 00:25:40,321
air currents change constantly,

617
00:25:40,442 --> 00:25:42,162
not to mention
when encountering demons in battle.

618
00:25:42,281 --> 00:25:42,882
The situation will become

619
00:25:43,001 --> 00:25:44,162
even more complicated and unpredictable.

620
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:45,841
Only when you can
maintain stable control

621
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,281
in turbulent air currents

622
00:25:47,361 --> 00:25:48,202
can you be considered
to have truly mastered

623
00:25:48,321 --> 00:25:49,162
Flying on Object.

624
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:50,601
Once we've learned this,

625
00:25:50,682 --> 00:25:51,642
how long do we have to fly

626
00:25:51,761 --> 00:25:53,321
before we can
get to where we want to go?

627
00:25:53,442 --> 00:25:54,402
Practice to a high level,

628
00:25:54,561 --> 00:25:55,561
and you can reach any place

629
00:25:55,722 --> 00:25:57,001
in an instant.

630
00:25:57,321 --> 00:25:58,321
That's amazing!

631
00:25:58,642 --> 00:25:59,521
Really?

632
00:25:59,682 --> 00:26:01,041
Youyue, once we've mastered it,

633
00:26:01,162 --> 00:26:02,281
we can fly freely.

634
00:26:03,761 --> 00:26:04,882
You guys give it a try.

635
00:27:20,081 --> 00:27:20,682
Youyue!

636
00:27:21,962 --> 00:27:22,962
Be careful, Jingqiu!

637
00:27:33,722 --> 00:27:34,321
Youyue!

638
00:27:34,722 --> 00:27:35,442
Youyue!

639
00:27:37,242 --> 00:27:38,162
Are you okay?

640
00:27:39,162 --> 00:27:39,722
Brother!

641
00:27:50,162 --> 00:27:51,922
Flying on Object may seem simple,

642
00:27:52,202 --> 00:27:54,162
but it requires
diligent practice after class.

643
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,801
- Yes!
- Yes!

644
00:27:58,801 --> 00:28:01,202
Situ Hong, are you okay?

645
00:28:01,321 --> 00:28:02,841
Thank you.

646
00:28:03,482 --> 00:28:05,041
I'm fine.

647
00:28:05,361 --> 00:28:06,081
Besides,

648
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,601
I didn't really help you much.

649
00:28:18,242 --> 00:28:18,922
Brother!

650
00:28:20,761 --> 00:28:21,442
Brother!

651
00:28:22,442 --> 00:28:24,642
Brother, how's your injury?

652
00:28:24,882 --> 00:28:25,561
It doesn't matter.

653
00:28:25,922 --> 00:28:26,962
Just a superficial wound.

654
00:28:27,081 --> 00:28:28,601
I saw it clearly.

655
00:28:28,722 --> 00:28:29,482
That Dongbo Xueying

656
00:28:29,482 --> 00:28:30,242
wanted to show off.

657
00:28:30,361 --> 00:28:31,442
He caused you to fall to the ground.

658
00:28:31,561 --> 00:28:32,482
How could he do

659
00:28:32,561 --> 00:28:33,321
such a thing?

660
00:28:33,402 --> 00:28:34,801
Xueying is not that kind of person.

661
00:28:35,041 --> 00:28:36,402
You don't know.

662
00:28:36,561 --> 00:28:37,841
There are many rumors

663
00:28:38,001 --> 00:28:38,801
outside now,

664
00:28:38,922 --> 00:28:40,001
saying

665
00:28:40,122 --> 00:28:42,202
that Dongbo Xueying was the hero

666
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:43,521
who saved the beauty, Jingqiu.

667
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,722
It was actually you
who saved her out of kindness first,

668
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:47,242
but now you've become a foil.

669
00:28:47,361 --> 00:28:48,402
What is Dongbo Xueying's

670
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:49,962
real intention?

671
00:28:51,682 --> 00:28:53,321
Brother, I think

672
00:28:53,482 --> 00:28:54,001
from now on,

673
00:28:54,001 --> 00:28:55,722
we have to be more cautious
around Dongbo Xueying.

674
00:28:55,722 --> 00:28:56,442
Borong,

675
00:28:58,682 --> 00:29:00,242
don't say such things in the future.

676
00:29:03,442 --> 00:29:04,442
I'll be careful.

677
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:14,162
This is bad!

678
00:29:14,162 --> 00:29:15,682
The Demon Clan has invaded
Changfeng Academy!

679
00:29:15,801 --> 00:29:17,081
Have the demons arrived so quickly?

680
00:29:19,442 --> 00:29:20,361
Everyone, don't panic!

681
00:30:43,962 --> 00:30:44,761
Cui Yong,

682
00:30:45,242 --> 00:30:46,122
I know it's you.

683
00:30:48,561 --> 00:30:49,761
Cui Yong?

684
00:30:55,682 --> 00:30:56,841
This is the first time

685
00:30:56,962 --> 00:30:58,162
I've been recognized so quickly.

686
00:31:02,601 --> 00:31:03,281
Stop fighting.

687
00:31:12,162 --> 00:31:14,361
Young man, tell me,

688
00:31:14,561 --> 00:31:15,841
how did you recognize me?

689
00:31:15,962 --> 00:31:16,722
First of all,

690
00:31:16,882 --> 00:31:18,162
although you have black smoke

691
00:31:18,281 --> 00:31:19,321
and your clothing as disguises,

692
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:20,321
your techniques

693
00:31:20,442 --> 00:31:21,601
don't have demonic energy.

694
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:22,882
Secondly,

695
00:31:23,402 --> 00:31:24,482
your moves

696
00:31:24,841 --> 00:31:26,722
deliberately avoided
the opponent's vital points.

697
00:31:26,962 --> 00:31:28,761
Obviously, you don't want to hurt us.

698
00:31:29,041 --> 00:31:29,682
Lastly,

699
00:31:30,162 --> 00:31:31,922
I've heard of you before.

700
00:31:32,242 --> 00:31:34,402
I know you're skilled
in using the Wind Blade.

701
00:31:34,521 --> 00:31:36,361
When I saw your control
over the wind just now,

702
00:31:36,442 --> 00:31:37,482
I guessed it was you.

703
00:31:40,561 --> 00:31:42,202
Today's surprise attack drill

704
00:31:42,321 --> 00:31:43,001
is to test

705
00:31:43,041 --> 00:31:44,321
your reaction abilities.

706
00:31:44,442 --> 00:31:45,761
After this period of practicing,

707
00:31:45,922 --> 00:31:47,482
everyone's martial arts have improved.

708
00:31:47,801 --> 00:31:49,081
Just now, Situ Hong

709
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:50,841
acted decisively and showed no fear
in the face of danger.

710
00:31:51,001 --> 00:31:51,761
It's worthy of praise.

711
00:31:52,801 --> 00:31:54,442
Now, the Demon Clan is waiting
for an opportunity,

712
00:31:54,722 --> 00:31:56,321
and their attack can come at any time.

713
00:31:56,442 --> 00:31:58,162
You must always stay alert.

714
00:31:58,442 --> 00:31:59,682
Equally important as your martial arts

715
00:31:59,682 --> 00:32:01,722
are your observation
and judgment skills.

716
00:32:02,442 --> 00:32:03,642
The Demon Clan will attack in various

717
00:32:03,801 --> 00:32:05,041
cunning ways.

718
00:32:05,202 --> 00:32:06,081
I hope that in the future,

719
00:32:06,242 --> 00:32:07,281
you will stay alert and calm

720
00:32:07,402 --> 00:32:09,242
just like today.

721
00:32:10,521 --> 00:32:11,521
Yes.

722
00:32:12,882 --> 00:32:14,442
(I almost thought)

723
00:32:14,601 --> 00:32:16,122
(we were going to fight
to the death today.)

724
00:32:16,402 --> 00:32:19,081
(I didn't expect it to be just a drill.)

725
00:32:19,482 --> 00:32:21,162
You saw the situation just now.

726
00:32:21,361 --> 00:32:21,922
But in the end,

727
00:32:22,081 --> 00:32:23,922
it was Dongbo Xueying who showed no fear

728
00:32:24,041 --> 00:32:25,361
and found the solution.

729
00:32:26,162 --> 00:32:27,722
Xueying is smart and careful.

730
00:32:27,922 --> 00:32:29,281
His martial arts are well-practiced.

731
00:32:29,442 --> 00:32:30,642
He's also humble.

732
00:32:30,841 --> 00:32:33,001
In the future, he will certainly
achieve great things.

733
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:34,162
Brother,

734
00:32:34,642 --> 00:32:36,402
you were actually more amazing just now.

735
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:36,841
You were fighting all the time.

736
00:32:36,841 --> 00:32:37,402
Borong.

737
00:32:37,482 --> 00:32:38,482
You can see things just like me.

738
00:32:38,922 --> 00:32:40,521
I didn't expect you to be so perceptive.

739
00:32:40,841 --> 00:32:42,242
In such a tense environment,

740
00:32:42,242 --> 00:32:43,642
we were all just focused on fighting.

741
00:32:45,962 --> 00:32:47,281
(Although it was intense,)

742
00:32:47,601 --> 00:32:48,962
(I didn't realize)

743
00:32:49,722 --> 00:32:50,561
(that those people in black)

744
00:32:50,561 --> 00:32:52,001
(didn't want to hurt us at all.)

745
00:32:54,482 --> 00:32:55,122
Let's go.

746
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,122
Xueying,

747
00:33:05,281 --> 00:33:06,122
you did so well

748
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:07,642
in today's drill.

749
00:33:07,761 --> 00:33:09,321
Last time I came, you weren't here.

750
00:33:09,482 --> 00:33:10,442
This time, you must try

751
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:11,242
my cooking.

752
00:33:11,962 --> 00:33:13,722
Youyue, I'm not hungry.

753
00:33:15,841 --> 00:33:17,922
I-I've cooked some for everyone.

754
00:33:18,041 --> 00:33:19,122
Everyone gets a share.

755
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,242
I can also get a share?

756
00:33:20,922 --> 00:33:21,682
I knew it.

757
00:33:21,722 --> 00:33:23,561
Kong Youyue is the most caring.

758
00:33:24,122 --> 00:33:24,922
Thank you, Sister.

759
00:33:27,081 --> 00:33:27,962
This time,

760
00:33:28,122 --> 00:33:29,962
although it's just a drill,

761
00:33:30,081 --> 00:33:31,442
we've experienced

762
00:33:31,601 --> 00:33:32,442
a tough fight.

763
00:33:32,722 --> 00:33:34,001
Everyone has worked hard.

764
00:33:34,162 --> 00:33:34,882
I've cooked a delicious soup

765
00:33:34,922 --> 00:33:36,442
to reward everyone.

766
00:33:38,482 --> 00:33:39,242
Youyue,

767
00:33:39,561 --> 00:33:41,122
I know you're the kindest person.

768
00:33:41,242 --> 00:33:42,162
Thank you.

769
00:33:43,682 --> 00:33:45,361
Those who ran away don't get a share.

770
00:33:47,601 --> 00:33:49,722
Well, my strategy

771
00:33:49,801 --> 00:33:51,521
was to retreat.

772
00:33:52,001 --> 00:33:53,041
Xueying,

773
00:33:53,162 --> 00:33:54,242
everyone has had some.

774
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:55,561
You should drink some, too.

775
00:33:55,722 --> 00:33:57,242
Why is Xueying's bowl so big?

776
00:33:57,402 --> 00:33:58,761
Aren't you afraid of choking him?

777
00:33:58,922 --> 00:34:00,001
Si Borong,

778
00:34:00,122 --> 00:34:01,601
even drinking soup
won't shut your mouth.

779
00:34:01,882 --> 00:34:03,081
You might as well not drink it.

780
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:05,281
Alright, alright.

781
00:34:05,402 --> 00:34:06,104
My sister

782
00:34:06,104 --> 00:34:08,281
is especially caring towards Xueying.

783
00:34:08,522 --> 00:34:10,082
As her younger brother,

784
00:34:10,202 --> 00:34:11,321
I am treated the same.

785
00:34:11,481 --> 00:34:12,522
Hurry, hurry, drink up.

786
00:34:15,002 --> 00:34:17,042
Xueying, drink up.

787
00:34:26,823 --> 00:34:29,202
(Changfeng Academy)

788
00:34:29,202 --> 00:34:30,002
Xueying.

789
00:34:30,841 --> 00:34:31,682
Xueying,

790
00:34:32,122 --> 00:34:33,242
the Weapon Fair
in Dragon Mountain Empire

791
00:34:33,242 --> 00:34:33,841
is about to begin.

792
00:34:33,841 --> 00:34:35,002
Let's go and see the excitement.

793
00:34:35,162 --> 00:34:36,122
What Weapon Fair?

794
00:34:37,122 --> 00:34:37,881
See for yourself.

795
00:34:38,042 --> 00:34:38,761
The Weapon Fair

796
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:39,602
is an annual event
in the Dragon Mountain Empire,

797
00:34:39,602 --> 00:34:40,761
where weapons are traded

798
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:42,162
and showcased in a grand gathering.

799
00:34:42,242 --> 00:34:43,961
It's held in Fragrance Ancient Town
in Yishui City.

800
00:34:44,122 --> 00:34:45,202
Let's go and enjoy the festivities.

801
00:34:45,321 --> 00:34:46,122
There will be all kinds of

802
00:34:46,162 --> 00:34:47,202
delicious food and fun things to do.

803
00:34:47,361 --> 00:34:48,242
I've already inquired about it.

804
00:34:48,321 --> 00:34:49,122
The academy will give us a day off

805
00:34:49,122 --> 00:34:50,481
for the Weapon Fair.

806
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:51,602
I'm not interested.

807
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:52,522
You guys go ahead.

808
00:34:54,642 --> 00:34:56,042
Why are you such a party pooper?

809
00:34:58,921 --> 00:34:59,841
Kong Hao, look.

810
00:35:00,361 --> 00:35:01,122
Are you going or not?

811
00:35:01,401 --> 00:35:02,361
I'm not going, either.

812
00:35:02,481 --> 00:35:03,841
I haven't finished my flying device yet.

813
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:04,281
You go ahead.

814
00:35:04,281 --> 00:35:04,722
Alright.

815
00:35:04,722 --> 00:35:06,002
But it's a rare opportunity
for us to attend...

816
00:35:06,522 --> 00:35:08,281
Such a grand weapons event.

817
00:35:08,361 --> 00:35:09,401
Of course, we should go and take a look.

818
00:35:09,682 --> 00:35:10,961
A good horse deserves a good saddle.

819
00:35:11,082 --> 00:35:12,281
I can use this chance
to change my staff.

820
00:35:12,481 --> 00:35:13,921
Borong, Mr. Si,

821
00:35:14,082 --> 00:35:15,162
let's go and take a look together.

822
00:35:17,162 --> 00:35:17,921
What's the point of going and looking?

823
00:35:17,921 --> 00:35:18,602
With your skills,

824
00:35:18,602 --> 00:35:20,002
changing staffs
so frequently is useless.

825
00:35:21,162 --> 00:35:22,321
Puyang Bo, who are you talking about?

826
00:35:29,321 --> 00:35:30,682
Jingqiu, Youyue,

827
00:35:30,961 --> 00:35:32,441
are you interested in the Weapon Fair?

828
00:35:32,562 --> 00:35:33,562
Do you want to go together?

829
00:35:33,562 --> 00:35:34,522
Not interested.

830
00:35:34,602 --> 00:35:36,522
My family runs a weapon shop.

831
00:35:36,602 --> 00:35:38,002
I went there every year.

832
00:35:38,162 --> 00:35:39,122
It's nothing special.

833
00:35:39,481 --> 00:35:40,642
I'll probably go.

834
00:35:40,642 --> 00:35:42,122
I need to find something.

835
00:35:42,682 --> 00:35:43,352
Is it the thing you told me

836
00:35:43,352 --> 00:35:44,562
you lost last time?

837
00:35:45,122 --> 00:35:45,921
I'll go with you.

838
00:35:46,242 --> 00:35:47,761
What riddles are you two playing?

839
00:35:47,801 --> 00:35:48,841
So mysterious.

840
00:35:49,082 --> 00:35:50,321
What are you looking for?

841
00:35:50,642 --> 00:35:51,682
Something

842
00:35:51,921 --> 00:35:52,761
that might be related

843
00:35:52,761 --> 00:35:53,761
to my parents.

844
00:35:54,761 --> 00:35:55,961
Well, Xueying,

845
00:35:55,961 --> 00:35:56,562
just now when I asked you to go,

846
00:35:56,562 --> 00:35:57,321
why didn't you say yes?

847
00:35:57,321 --> 00:35:58,162
Now Jingqiu asked you to go,

848
00:35:58,162 --> 00:35:58,722
and you said yes right away.

849
00:35:58,722 --> 00:36:00,082
Don't you treat me as your friend?

850
00:36:03,441 --> 00:36:05,122
Then, I'll go, too.

851
00:36:06,242 --> 00:36:07,481
Don't you go there every year?

852
00:36:07,562 --> 00:36:08,481
Maybe you shouldn't go this year.

853
00:36:09,002 --> 00:36:10,162
What's wrong with going every year?

854
00:36:10,162 --> 00:36:11,281
I can't go this year?

855
00:36:18,361 --> 00:36:19,921
Your Lordship,

856
00:36:20,122 --> 00:36:21,441
only  the last batch of
one hundred thousand source stones

857
00:36:21,441 --> 00:36:22,522
hasn't arrived.

858
00:36:22,522 --> 00:36:23,841
The rest are all here.

859
00:36:24,042 --> 00:36:24,761
Very good.

860
00:36:25,002 --> 00:36:26,441
As soon as the source stones arrive,

861
00:36:27,042 --> 00:36:28,242
we will assemble those demons

862
00:36:28,242 --> 00:36:29,642
from the abyss

863
00:36:29,642 --> 00:36:30,722
of the Demon Well

864
00:36:30,921 --> 00:36:32,002
and prepare to set out.

865
00:36:32,881 --> 00:36:34,042
Congratulations, Your Lordship.

866
00:36:34,321 --> 00:36:37,361
(Lu Huairu)
The Demon Clan will rule the world.

867
00:36:37,642 --> 00:36:39,642
Of course, this can't be achieved
without your contribution.

868
00:36:40,321 --> 00:36:42,361
Once the Demon Clan rules
the Dragon Mountain Empire,

869
00:36:42,722 --> 00:36:44,042
you will enjoy endless

870
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,202
wealth, honor,

871
00:36:45,321 --> 00:36:47,321
and supreme power.

872
00:36:47,481 --> 00:36:48,122
No,

873
00:36:48,321 --> 00:36:50,082
I don't want power or status.

874
00:36:50,441 --> 00:36:52,321
I want to follow you forever

875
00:36:52,602 --> 00:36:55,002
and be a true demon.

876
00:36:58,801 --> 00:37:00,522
Great Demon God Da Er Hao

877
00:37:00,682 --> 00:37:02,481
will fulfill your wish.

878
00:37:40,961 --> 00:37:42,801
Thank you for prolonging my life.

879
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:43,921
If you didn't save me,

880
00:37:44,801 --> 00:37:46,562
I would have been dead.

881
00:37:47,522 --> 00:37:48,281
Soon,

882
00:37:48,281 --> 00:37:50,361
it will be the Weapon Fair
in Dragon Mountain Empire.

883
00:37:50,642 --> 00:37:52,361
At that time, there will be many people,

884
00:37:52,562 --> 00:37:53,841
and their attention

885
00:37:53,841 --> 00:37:55,361
will be focused on the Weapon Fair.

886
00:37:55,602 --> 00:37:57,122
We will strike on that day.

887
00:37:57,522 --> 00:37:58,242
Yes.

888
00:37:59,761 --> 00:38:00,281
Look.

889
00:38:00,321 --> 00:38:01,242
I was right, wasn't I?

890
00:38:01,361 --> 00:38:02,562
The more lively the place,

891
00:38:02,562 --> 00:38:03,841
the easier it is to find good food.

892
00:38:03,841 --> 00:38:04,602
Do you want some?

893
00:38:05,682 --> 00:38:06,522
I still haven't found

894
00:38:06,522 --> 00:38:07,841
what I'm looking for.

895
00:38:09,401 --> 00:38:10,281
Don't be disappointed.

896
00:38:10,881 --> 00:38:11,921
Not all weapon shops

897
00:38:11,961 --> 00:38:12,761
participate

898
00:38:12,761 --> 00:38:13,642
in this Weapon Fair.

899
00:38:13,642 --> 00:38:15,082
Maybe some didn't attend.

900
00:38:15,321 --> 00:38:16,242
I'll go with you to search each one

901
00:38:16,242 --> 00:38:17,401
at the next Weapon Fair.

902
00:38:17,841 --> 00:38:18,522
Before I came here,

903
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:19,961
I was already mentally prepared.

904
00:38:20,202 --> 00:38:21,562
There has been no news of my parents

905
00:38:21,562 --> 00:38:22,642
for so many years.

906
00:38:22,921 --> 00:38:23,682
It's not easy

907
00:38:23,682 --> 00:38:25,162
to find it.

908
00:38:25,722 --> 00:38:27,562
Jingqiu, what are you looking for?

909
00:38:27,562 --> 00:38:28,801
What happened to your parents?

910
00:38:28,801 --> 00:38:29,441
Forget it.

911
00:38:29,522 --> 00:38:30,642
We rarely get a chance to go out.

912
00:38:30,682 --> 00:38:32,002
Let's enjoy ourselves before going back.

913
00:38:32,801 --> 00:38:33,761
There's a lantern riddle
guessing game here.

914
00:38:33,761 --> 00:38:34,481
Let's take a look.

915
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:56,162
Jingqiu, look over there.

916
00:39:02,122 --> 00:39:03,002
Could it be the Demon Clan

917
00:39:03,002 --> 00:39:04,562
is secretly doing something
during the Weapon Fair?

918
00:39:04,921 --> 00:39:05,642
Let's check it out.

919
00:39:06,722 --> 00:39:07,761
Youyue, Puyang Bo,

920
00:39:07,761 --> 00:39:08,562
wait for us here.

921
00:39:08,562 --> 00:39:09,361
We'll be back soon.

922
00:39:15,682 --> 00:39:16,562
Xueying?

923
00:39:17,562 --> 00:39:18,522
What is he

924
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:19,481
in such a hurry for?

925
00:39:19,881 --> 00:39:20,841
What is this Dongbo Xueying

926
00:39:20,841 --> 00:39:21,761
up to?

927
00:39:21,841 --> 00:39:23,321
Showing off even here.

928
00:39:23,522 --> 00:39:24,162
No,

929
00:39:24,441 --> 00:39:25,562
something must have happened.

930
00:39:25,761 --> 00:39:26,481
Let's check it out.

931
00:39:29,841 --> 00:39:31,082
Mr. Si, Borong,

932
00:39:31,122 --> 00:39:33,082
I suddenly feel uncomfortable
in my stomach.

933
00:39:33,082 --> 00:39:34,321
You can go first.

934
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:35,122
It's okay.

935
00:39:35,160 --> 00:39:36,088
If your stomach is uncomfortable,

936
00:39:36,088 --> 00:39:37,481
go back and rest early.

937
00:39:38,281 --> 00:39:39,321
No, no.

938
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:03,841
Xueying!

939
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:05,361
Jingqiu!

940
00:40:07,841 --> 00:40:09,401
Jingqiu, what happened?

941
00:40:09,602 --> 00:40:10,642
Xueying accidentally entered

942
00:40:10,642 --> 00:40:11,522
the teleportation array
of the Demon Clan.

943
00:40:11,522 --> 00:40:12,801
We don't know where he is now.

944
00:40:13,042 --> 00:40:13,784
These demons

945
00:40:13,784 --> 00:40:15,128
must be the same ones who entered
the Dragon Mountain Empire

946
00:40:15,128 --> 00:40:16,682
from Nanqin City last time.

947
00:40:16,921 --> 00:40:18,122
Xueying followed them alone.

948
00:40:18,122 --> 00:40:19,002
It must be dangerous.

949
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:21,481
It's his own fault
for overestimating himself

950
00:40:21,642 --> 00:40:23,082
and trying to be a hero alone.

951
00:40:23,122 --> 00:40:24,162
It's none of our business.

952
00:40:24,242 --> 00:40:24,921
How can you say that?

953
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:25,522
Si Borong,

954
00:40:26,072 --> 00:40:27,321
shut your mouth.

955
00:40:27,682 --> 00:40:28,562
Well, Jingqiu.

956
00:40:28,682 --> 00:40:29,642
Don't worry for now.

957
00:40:29,881 --> 00:40:31,122
Xueying should be nearby.

958
00:40:31,321 --> 00:40:32,202
Let's look for him.

959
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:32,961
Alright.

960
00:40:43,162 --> 00:40:44,242
(How come the piping)

961
00:40:44,522 --> 00:40:45,722
(sounds familiar?)

962
00:40:45,881 --> 00:40:47,562

in the Destruction Mountain Range...)
