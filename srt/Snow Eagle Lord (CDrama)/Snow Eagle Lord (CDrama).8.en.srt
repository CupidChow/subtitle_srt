(Lu's Fort)

22
00:02:49,466 --> 00:02:50,066
Your Lordship.

23
00:02:52,626 --> 00:02:54,026
Your Lordship, you look like

24
00:02:54,146 --> 00:02:55,705
you're injured by Dou Qi.

25
00:02:55,945 --> 00:02:57,505
You ran into a fierce opponent.

26
00:02:57,626 --> 00:02:58,385
Bring the dagger.

27
00:02:59,385 --> 00:03:00,225
Hurry up.

28
00:03:00,346 --> 00:03:00,985
The dagger.

29
00:03:20,216 --> 00:03:22,265
Your Lordship, your blood

30
00:03:23,466 --> 00:03:25,746
is truly wonderful.

31
00:03:27,466 --> 00:03:28,385
I've smelled

32
00:03:28,385 --> 00:03:29,626
victory.

33
00:03:29,945 --> 00:03:31,385
Dongbo Xueying.

34
00:03:31,545 --> 00:03:33,825
I swear I will cut you piece by piece

35
00:03:34,026 --> 00:03:36,105
and crush your bones.

36
00:03:36,265 --> 00:03:36,825
Yeah.

37
00:03:37,105 --> 00:03:37,906
Crush his bones.

38
00:03:39,785 --> 00:03:40,505
Your Lordship.

39
00:03:40,906 --> 00:03:41,945
Are you still hurting?

40
00:03:47,665 --> 00:03:49,026
- Xueying.
- Xueying.

41
00:03:51,346 --> 00:03:52,105
Xueying.

42
00:03:55,945 --> 00:03:57,505
Xueying, you're hurt.

43
00:04:08,146 --> 00:04:08,866
How are you?

44
00:04:09,146 --> 00:04:10,066
Feeling better?

45
00:04:10,665 --> 00:04:12,146
I ran into the Demon Clan.

46
00:04:12,626 --> 00:04:13,346
Where?

47
00:04:17,465 --> 00:04:18,465
I'm not sure.

48
00:04:18,905 --> 00:04:20,465
Somewhere in the woods.

49
00:04:20,666 --> 00:04:22,066
Towards the east, maybe.

50
00:04:22,825 --> 00:04:23,825
Go take a look.

51
00:04:24,265 --> 00:04:25,705
They may be up to something.

52
00:04:26,106 --> 00:04:26,825
Maybe

53
00:04:26,905 --> 00:04:28,945
you guys should go take a look.

54
00:04:29,145 --> 00:04:30,666
Xueying doesn't look so well.

55
00:04:30,825 --> 00:04:32,025
I'll take care of him here.

56
00:04:32,145 --> 00:04:33,385
We'll join you once he's better.

57
00:04:33,546 --> 00:04:34,106
Alright.

58
00:04:52,066 --> 00:04:53,226
Let's rest here

59
00:04:53,226 --> 00:04:53,986
for the night.

60
00:04:54,106 --> 00:04:54,585
I have

61
00:04:54,585 --> 00:04:55,905
set up a protective barrier.

62
00:04:55,986 --> 00:04:57,226
It extracts the essence of nature

63
00:04:57,345 --> 00:04:58,825
which helps you recover.

64
00:04:59,145 --> 00:05:00,025
Tomorrow morning,

65
00:05:00,025 --> 00:05:01,145
we'll find Master.

66
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,025
Okay.

67
00:05:53,905 --> 00:05:55,265
Do you feel any better?

68
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:58,465
My Dou Qi is still disturbed.

69
00:05:58,945 --> 00:05:59,825
You got injured badly

70
00:05:59,825 --> 00:06:00,746
last night.

71
00:06:00,905 --> 00:06:02,106
It'd be great if we have

72
00:06:02,106 --> 00:06:02,825
source stone sap.

73
00:06:04,226 --> 00:06:04,866
By the way,

74
00:06:04,986 --> 00:06:05,945
Youyue and Puyang Bo

75
00:06:06,106 --> 00:06:07,306
are still at the Fragrance Ancient Town.

76
00:06:07,426 --> 00:06:08,585
Let's go there.

77
00:06:08,786 --> 00:06:10,505
I bet there are source stones for sale.

78
00:06:10,825 --> 00:06:11,905
Situ Hong and Si Borong

79
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:12,626
went looking

80
00:06:12,626 --> 00:06:13,626
for the demons

81
00:06:13,746 --> 00:06:14,786
as you told them.

82
00:06:15,505 --> 00:06:16,866
Once you recover a bit,

83
00:06:17,025 --> 00:06:18,106
we'll go find them.

84
00:06:19,426 --> 00:06:20,106
Okay.

85
00:06:25,066 --> 00:06:25,746
Youyue.

86
00:06:27,345 --> 00:06:28,066
Jingqiu.

87
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,106
Xueying.

88
00:06:29,226 --> 00:06:30,505
You finally came back.

89
00:06:30,626 --> 00:06:31,345
I've waited

90
00:06:31,426 --> 00:06:32,786
for you here the whole night.

91
00:06:32,905 --> 00:06:34,306
We ran into the Demon Clan.

92
00:06:34,746 --> 00:06:36,226
Thankfully, Jingqiu helped.

93
00:06:36,345 --> 00:06:37,465
I'm feeling better now.

94
00:06:39,306 --> 00:06:40,345
You were

95
00:06:40,426 --> 00:06:42,546
together the whole night?

96
00:06:42,866 --> 00:06:44,465
Xueying was severely injured.

97
00:06:44,626 --> 00:06:45,666
I tried to heal him.

98
00:06:47,666 --> 00:06:49,426
I'm not saying anything.

99
00:06:49,585 --> 00:06:51,186
I'm just worried about you two.

100
00:06:51,465 --> 00:06:52,145
My Dou Qi

101
00:06:52,306 --> 00:06:53,186
is still disturbed.

102
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:55,226
I need some source stones to recover.

103
00:06:55,505 --> 00:06:56,866
Situ Hong and Si Borong went

104
00:06:56,866 --> 00:06:57,505
after the demons.

105
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:58,505
I'm a bit worried.

106
00:06:58,666 --> 00:06:59,786
Let's get the source stones

107
00:06:59,945 --> 00:07:00,986
and join them.

108
00:07:01,186 --> 00:07:01,786
Okay.

109
00:07:06,626 --> 00:07:07,426
Puyang Bo.

110
00:07:10,986 --> 00:07:12,226
What? Food is ready?

111
00:07:12,226 --> 00:07:13,746
All you do is sleep and eat.

112
00:07:13,986 --> 00:07:14,945
Let's go now.

113
00:07:15,066 --> 00:07:15,585
Come on.

114
00:07:16,666 --> 00:07:17,385
Where to?

115
00:07:19,786 --> 00:07:20,465
Sir,

116
00:07:20,585 --> 00:07:21,705
I'd like a source stone.

117
00:07:21,825 --> 00:07:22,465
I'm sorry.

118
00:07:22,465 --> 00:07:23,385
Our source stones

119
00:07:23,385 --> 00:07:24,226
are sold out.

120
00:07:24,306 --> 00:07:25,585
(Qian's Weaponry)
Try somewhere else.

121
00:07:27,986 --> 00:07:28,705
Sir,

122
00:07:28,825 --> 00:07:29,746
do you have source stones?

123
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:30,546
Too bad.

124
00:07:30,666 --> 00:07:32,265
They just got sold out.

125
00:07:32,746 --> 00:07:34,265
Again?

126
00:07:34,426 --> 00:07:35,106
Yeah.

127
00:07:35,306 --> 00:07:36,345
The source stones

128
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:37,345
get sold out

129
00:07:37,505 --> 00:07:39,066
instantly these days.

130
00:07:39,226 --> 00:07:40,585
Source stones are common

131
00:07:40,585 --> 00:07:41,426
in weapon stores.

132
00:07:41,426 --> 00:07:43,025
They shouldn't be all sold out.

133
00:07:43,145 --> 00:07:43,905
It's weird.

134
00:07:44,666 --> 00:07:45,746
All these source stones

135
00:07:45,746 --> 00:07:46,306
are too much

136
00:07:46,306 --> 00:07:47,746
for ordinary training.

137
00:07:48,106 --> 00:07:49,385
Is something going on?

138
00:07:50,825 --> 00:07:51,426
Sir,

139
00:07:51,746 --> 00:07:52,465
when did they

140
00:07:52,465 --> 00:07:53,265
get sold out?

141
00:07:53,465 --> 00:07:54,265
Right before

142
00:07:54,426 --> 00:07:55,306
you came.

143
00:07:55,505 --> 00:07:55,945
I think

144
00:07:56,066 --> 00:07:56,825
they're

145
00:07:56,825 --> 00:07:58,426
heading east with the cart.

146
00:07:59,465 --> 00:08:00,746
What else did they get?

147
00:08:00,866 --> 00:08:01,505
Nothing.

148
00:08:01,666 --> 00:08:03,025
They come every ten days

149
00:08:03,145 --> 00:08:04,145
only for source stones.

150
00:08:04,265 --> 00:08:06,186
They never haggle over the price

151
00:08:06,306 --> 00:08:07,265
and get them all.

152
00:08:07,705 --> 00:08:08,226
Do you remember

153
00:08:08,226 --> 00:08:09,145
how they look?

154
00:08:09,145 --> 00:08:10,505
They are all martial artists,

155
00:08:10,546 --> 00:08:11,585
looking neat.

156
00:08:12,866 --> 00:08:13,465
Let's go.

157
00:08:18,786 --> 00:08:19,905
Stay alert.

158
00:08:26,585 --> 00:08:27,145
Youyue.

159
00:08:28,253 --> 00:08:30,744
(Visionary Gaze)

160
00:08:33,786 --> 00:08:34,745
All candles.

161
00:08:34,745 --> 00:08:35,786
No source stones.

162
00:08:35,985 --> 00:08:36,786
Something's wrong.

163
00:08:37,186 --> 00:08:37,786
Who would

164
00:08:37,786 --> 00:08:38,945
get so many candles?

165
00:08:39,186 --> 00:08:40,146
Let's find out

166
00:08:40,146 --> 00:08:40,985
what those are.

167
00:08:57,945 --> 00:08:58,426
Stop.

168
00:08:58,666 --> 00:08:59,105
Guys.

169
00:08:59,105 --> 00:09:00,026
- Stay back.
- Let us help.

170
00:09:00,745 --> 00:09:01,546
Let me help.

171
00:09:01,985 --> 00:09:02,465
No, thanks.

172
00:09:02,465 --> 00:09:03,506
It's okay. No problem.

173
00:09:03,585 --> 00:09:03,906
You're welcome.

174
00:09:03,906 --> 00:09:04,865
My friend.

175
00:09:05,105 --> 00:09:06,066
It's okay.

176
00:09:06,906 --> 00:09:07,625
Okay, pack up.

177
00:09:10,386 --> 00:09:11,225
Load the cart.

178
00:09:33,386 --> 00:09:34,465
Lu's Fort.

179
00:09:36,026 --> 00:09:37,066
You know them?

180
00:09:37,506 --> 00:09:38,745
Not so much.

181
00:09:38,945 --> 00:09:39,825
I met Lu Huairu once.

182
00:09:39,825 --> 00:09:41,066
He's the Fort Master

183
00:09:41,066 --> 00:09:42,105
of Lu's Fort.

184
00:09:42,266 --> 00:09:43,546
This is a wealthy family

185
00:09:43,546 --> 00:09:44,705
in Qutai City

186
00:09:44,865 --> 00:09:45,705
(Lu's Fort)
with many servants.

187
00:09:46,026 --> 00:09:46,945
Every year,

188
00:09:46,945 --> 00:09:47,906
they buy a lot of weapons.

189
00:09:48,026 --> 00:09:49,426
My father wanted to work with them.

190
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:51,026
But Lu Huairu turned him down.

191
00:09:51,546 --> 00:09:52,506
Really?

192
00:09:53,345 --> 00:09:54,625
Your weapon workshop

193
00:09:54,786 --> 00:09:55,386
is one of

194
00:09:55,386 --> 00:09:56,465
the best in the empire.

195
00:09:56,625 --> 00:09:57,546
I later found out

196
00:09:57,705 --> 00:09:58,465
that they use

197
00:09:58,625 --> 00:09:59,705
their own source stones

198
00:09:59,705 --> 00:10:00,865
and golden stones

199
00:10:00,865 --> 00:10:02,345
for refining at Moyang's Fort.

200
00:10:02,506 --> 00:10:04,266
They only work with Moyang's Fort.

201
00:10:04,506 --> 00:10:06,625
Lu Huairu is really cunning.

202
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:07,666
Common residences

203
00:10:07,786 --> 00:10:08,666
can't store

204
00:10:08,786 --> 00:10:10,266
a large number of weapons.

205
00:10:10,426 --> 00:10:11,026
So,

206
00:10:11,146 --> 00:10:11,865
he built

207
00:10:12,026 --> 00:10:13,345
such a big fort.

208
00:10:13,585 --> 00:10:14,506
It may seem ordinary

209
00:10:14,666 --> 00:10:15,865
from the outside,

210
00:10:16,105 --> 00:10:17,506
but it's covered in traps.

211
00:10:17,666 --> 00:10:18,465
One mistake

212
00:10:18,625 --> 00:10:19,386
and you die.

213
00:10:20,225 --> 00:10:22,186
I don't think it'll be easy for us

214
00:10:22,306 --> 00:10:22,906
to inspect

215
00:10:22,985 --> 00:10:23,906
their relations

216
00:10:24,026 --> 00:10:25,105
with the Demon Clan.

217
00:10:25,225 --> 00:10:26,585
Lu Huairu has many

218
00:10:26,705 --> 00:10:28,506
Legend Level fighters working for him.

219
00:10:28,906 --> 00:10:30,306
He pays them well.

220
00:10:30,625 --> 00:10:32,026
Fort Master Lu

221
00:10:32,345 --> 00:10:33,585
sounds just like me.

222
00:10:33,585 --> 00:10:34,585
We don't want to die.

223
00:10:36,465 --> 00:10:37,105
Just kidding.

224
00:10:37,306 --> 00:10:38,666
He got so many protectors.

225
00:10:38,865 --> 00:10:39,386
There must be

226
00:10:39,386 --> 00:10:40,585
something shady in there.

227
00:10:40,625 --> 00:10:41,146
Right?

228
00:10:41,146 --> 00:10:41,825
Since we're here,

229
00:10:42,105 --> 00:10:42,945
we must get in

230
00:10:42,945 --> 00:10:43,666
and take a look.

231
00:10:43,825 --> 00:10:45,186
Xueying and I will enter first.

232
00:10:45,345 --> 00:10:46,386
Youyue, Puyang Bo,

233
00:10:46,386 --> 00:10:47,465
wait outside.

234
00:10:47,625 --> 00:10:48,585
If we don't come out

235
00:10:48,585 --> 00:10:49,825
in about half an hour,

236
00:10:49,865 --> 00:10:51,306
go find the Dean

237
00:10:51,306 --> 00:10:52,345
and ask for help.

238
00:10:52,426 --> 00:10:53,105
No.

239
00:10:53,345 --> 00:10:54,105
We can't let you

240
00:10:54,105 --> 00:10:55,105
take the risk alone.

241
00:10:55,266 --> 00:10:56,426
We will go together.

242
00:10:56,705 --> 00:10:58,705
I think I should

243
00:10:58,705 --> 00:10:59,825
go inform the dean.

244
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:01,386
Someone has to send the message.

245
00:11:01,386 --> 00:11:02,386
What if we barge in

246
00:11:02,386 --> 00:11:03,306
and fight so fiercely

247
00:11:03,306 --> 00:11:04,666
that no one can leave...

248
00:11:04,666 --> 00:11:06,225
Puyang Bo, don't jinx it.

249
00:11:06,426 --> 00:11:08,066
I'll be back in no time.

250
00:11:08,225 --> 00:11:09,426
I'll be fast. Trust me.

251
00:11:09,426 --> 00:11:10,026
Be quick.

252
00:11:10,985 --> 00:11:11,865
Puyang Bo.

253
00:11:12,426 --> 00:11:13,666
You coward.

254
00:11:14,625 --> 00:11:15,985
He has a point.

255
00:11:16,426 --> 00:11:17,186
Don't blame him.

256
00:11:17,506 --> 00:11:18,266
If the four of us

257
00:11:18,266 --> 00:11:18,745
go together

258
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:19,865
and run into trouble,

259
00:11:19,865 --> 00:11:20,865
we can't even get help.

260
00:11:21,105 --> 00:11:22,386
We should inform Master.

261
00:11:22,666 --> 00:11:23,825
He won't leave us here.

262
00:11:23,945 --> 00:11:25,026
Xueying,

263
00:11:25,105 --> 00:11:26,465
you're too nice to him.

264
00:11:26,625 --> 00:11:28,266
How can you keep defending him?

265
00:11:28,506 --> 00:11:29,985
I'm so mad at him.

266
00:11:30,186 --> 00:11:30,705
The fort

267
00:11:30,705 --> 00:11:32,105
must have a weakly guarded spot.

268
00:11:32,345 --> 00:11:33,705
Shall we go there

269
00:11:33,906 --> 00:11:34,825
and try to enter

270
00:11:35,026 --> 00:11:36,506
when they're not paying attention?

271
00:11:36,666 --> 00:11:37,426
What do you think?

272
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:39,146
We'll take the main gate.

273
00:11:39,345 --> 00:11:39,985
What?

274
00:11:40,865 --> 00:11:41,625
I have an idea.

275
00:11:46,386 --> 00:11:47,066
Master.

276
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,186
We have gathered

277
00:11:48,266 --> 00:11:49,225
all the source stones.

278
00:11:49,386 --> 00:11:50,945
Did you get noticed?

279
00:11:51,105 --> 00:11:51,585
No.

280
00:11:51,906 --> 00:11:53,105
I was extremely careful.

281
00:11:53,266 --> 00:11:54,105
We hid

282
00:11:54,306 --> 00:11:55,345
the source stones

283
00:11:55,345 --> 00:11:56,225
in candles and spice.

284
00:11:56,465 --> 00:11:57,345
When someone asked,

285
00:11:57,465 --> 00:11:58,546
I told them that

286
00:11:58,625 --> 00:11:59,386
these were

287
00:11:59,506 --> 00:12:01,625
meant for the festival events.

288
00:12:03,026 --> 00:12:03,825
Okay.

289
00:12:04,745 --> 00:12:05,865
Well done.

290
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:10,825
Who are you?

291
00:12:11,625 --> 00:12:12,506
We are alchemists

292
00:12:12,506 --> 00:12:13,786
from Moyang's Fort.

293
00:12:13,906 --> 00:12:15,105
We must see your master

294
00:12:15,186 --> 00:12:16,345
for an urgent issue.

295
00:12:16,666 --> 00:12:17,465
Your tablets?

296
00:12:19,105 --> 00:12:19,906
I was in a rush

297
00:12:19,906 --> 00:12:20,786
and forgot about it.

298
00:12:20,786 --> 00:12:22,026
Just go inform your master.

299
00:12:22,266 --> 00:12:23,386
If he doesn't see us

300
00:12:23,506 --> 00:12:24,266
and ruins the plan,

301
00:12:24,465 --> 00:12:25,465
he shouldn't blame it

302
00:12:25,465 --> 00:12:26,386
on us later.

303
00:12:26,945 --> 00:12:28,186
It's quite urgent.

304
00:12:28,266 --> 00:12:29,506
We rushed here

305
00:12:29,506 --> 00:12:30,625
but you're dawdling.

306
00:12:30,705 --> 00:12:31,985
If your master gets mad,

307
00:12:31,985 --> 00:12:32,906
you'll be in trouble.

308
00:12:34,105 --> 00:12:34,705
Fine.

309
00:12:34,945 --> 00:12:35,945
Just a minute.

310
00:12:42,985 --> 00:12:43,666
Master.

311
00:12:43,825 --> 00:12:44,666
Three alchemists

312
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:45,546
from Moyang's Fort

313
00:12:45,546 --> 00:12:46,865
came to see you.

314
00:12:48,546 --> 00:12:49,825
What do they want?

315
00:12:49,865 --> 00:12:50,985
They said

316
00:12:50,985 --> 00:12:52,225
they were sent here

317
00:12:52,225 --> 00:12:53,105
for an urgent issue.

318
00:12:55,906 --> 00:12:57,026
Urgent issue?

319
00:12:57,386 --> 00:12:58,745
It has been just a few days

320
00:12:58,865 --> 00:12:59,865
since I sent them

321
00:12:59,865 --> 00:13:01,146
the golden stones.

322
00:13:01,585 --> 00:13:03,266
He has already sent someone here?

323
00:13:03,786 --> 00:13:05,985
Moyang Chen.

324
00:13:06,186 --> 00:13:08,066
You're so greedy.

325
00:13:09,266 --> 00:13:11,345
I bet they're asking for more money.

326
00:13:11,786 --> 00:13:13,225
Send them away.

327
00:13:13,345 --> 00:13:13,945
Understood.

328
00:13:14,426 --> 00:13:15,386
You may leave, too.

329
00:13:15,386 --> 00:13:16,386
Understood, Master.

330
00:13:19,225 --> 00:13:20,026
I should check on

331
00:13:20,026 --> 00:13:21,546
God's Messenger first.

332
00:13:44,306 --> 00:13:45,026
Excuse me.

333
00:13:45,186 --> 00:13:46,585
Our master won't see anyone today.

334
00:13:46,745 --> 00:13:47,745
Please go back.

335
00:13:47,745 --> 00:13:48,386
No.

336
00:13:48,546 --> 00:13:49,306
We were told

337
00:13:49,306 --> 00:13:50,345
to meet your master.

338
00:13:51,625 --> 00:13:52,306
Wait.

339
00:13:52,506 --> 00:13:53,345
Guard the gate.

340
00:13:53,625 --> 00:13:54,306
Excuse me.

341
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:02,345
Brother.

342
00:14:03,105 --> 00:14:04,906
Something's off here.

343
00:14:05,146 --> 00:14:06,465
Are there demon soldiers around?

344
00:14:15,625 --> 00:14:17,465
Judging from the number of demons,

345
00:14:17,745 --> 00:14:19,465
Demon God Association
has a foothold here.

346
00:14:19,745 --> 00:14:21,225
There are too many of them.

347
00:14:21,345 --> 00:14:22,625
We're overwhelmed.

348
00:14:22,786 --> 00:14:23,865
Let's run.

349
00:14:24,225 --> 00:14:26,105
The Si Family won't escape but fight.

350
00:14:26,345 --> 00:14:26,985
Did you forget

351
00:14:26,985 --> 00:14:28,345
why we came to Changfeng Academy?

352
00:14:28,865 --> 00:14:29,506
Brother.

353
00:14:29,985 --> 00:14:31,105
If I die,

354
00:14:31,345 --> 00:14:32,546
remember,

355
00:14:33,186 --> 00:14:34,546
I die for you,

356
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,865
not for the Si Family.

357
00:14:36,985 --> 00:14:37,786
Be careful.

358
00:14:41,066 --> 00:14:41,705
Excuse me.

359
00:14:41,786 --> 00:14:42,625
Stay there.

360
00:14:42,985 --> 00:14:43,625
Excuse me.

361
00:14:45,745 --> 00:14:46,546
Stop looking around.

362
00:14:46,625 --> 00:14:47,546
Please go back.

363
00:14:47,945 --> 00:14:49,225
(So many source stones.)

364
00:14:49,465 --> 00:14:50,906
(They have even more here.)

365
00:14:51,266 --> 00:14:52,506
(What are they up to?)

366
00:14:52,786 --> 00:14:53,506
Excuse me.

367
00:14:53,985 --> 00:14:55,386
I must see your Fort Master.

368
00:14:56,906 --> 00:14:57,985
Please go back.

369
00:14:58,386 --> 00:14:59,266
What happened?

370
00:14:59,786 --> 00:15:00,705
What's going on?

371
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,146
They barged in.

372
00:15:06,186 --> 00:15:07,306
You guys?

373
00:15:07,306 --> 00:15:07,985
Guards!

374
00:15:10,825 --> 00:15:11,666
Kill them!

375
00:15:11,865 --> 00:15:12,625
Kill them!

376
00:15:41,066 --> 00:15:41,745
Xueying.

377
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:42,985
Look at the pattern.

378
00:15:43,186 --> 00:15:44,345
It's the one we saw

379
00:15:44,345 --> 00:15:45,225
in the demon factory.

380
00:15:46,945 --> 00:15:47,745
Here's a cave.

381
00:15:51,985 --> 00:15:52,985
Lu Huairu

382
00:15:53,105 --> 00:15:54,585
is definitely working

383
00:15:54,705 --> 00:15:56,186
for the Demon God Association.

384
00:15:56,426 --> 00:15:57,146
Youyue.

385
00:16:14,546 --> 00:16:15,546
Found it.

386
00:16:30,865 --> 00:16:31,426
Brother.

387
00:16:31,625 --> 00:16:32,506
Why do the demons

388
00:16:32,506 --> 00:16:33,306
keep coming

389
00:16:33,306 --> 00:16:34,465
like they don't end?

390
00:16:39,825 --> 00:16:40,546
Your Lordship.

391
00:16:40,745 --> 00:16:43,066
The last source stones have arrived.

392
00:16:43,985 --> 00:16:45,465
Are you sure?

393
00:16:45,705 --> 00:16:46,225
Yes.

394
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:47,705
We are counting and boxing up.

395
00:16:47,865 --> 00:16:49,105
It'll be done soon.

396
00:16:49,386 --> 00:16:50,186
Great.

397
00:16:50,786 --> 00:16:51,825
Take them all back.

398
00:16:52,465 --> 00:16:54,585
We finally have enough energy

399
00:16:54,786 --> 00:16:56,146
to break the Demon Well.

400
00:16:57,066 --> 00:16:58,225
With these source stones

401
00:16:58,225 --> 00:16:59,945
and well-built Abyss Demons,

402
00:17:00,146 --> 00:17:02,066
the Demon Clan can finally carry out

403
00:17:02,506 --> 00:17:04,345
the first step of the plan.

404
00:17:04,585 --> 00:17:05,825
You will be greatly rewarded.

405
00:17:09,145 --> 00:17:10,345
It's my honor

406
00:17:10,345 --> 00:17:11,546
to serve you, Your Lordship.

407
00:17:12,185 --> 00:17:13,986
We gathered so many source stones.

408
00:17:14,226 --> 00:17:15,506
Did anyone notice it?

409
00:17:15,706 --> 00:17:16,625
Your Lordship, rest assured.

410
00:17:17,185 --> 00:17:18,105
We only used

411
00:17:18,306 --> 00:17:19,786
devout Demon Clan Emissaries.

412
00:17:19,986 --> 00:17:20,746
Great.

413
00:17:21,425 --> 00:17:22,905
I will ask the Second Priest

414
00:17:22,905 --> 00:17:23,986
to reward you.

415
00:17:24,185 --> 00:17:25,145
Thank you, Your Lordship.

416
00:17:25,585 --> 00:17:27,585
Demon God taught me
the Forbidden Technique

417
00:17:27,825 --> 00:17:28,665
and helped me

418
00:17:28,665 --> 00:17:30,026
escape from the prison

419
00:17:30,026 --> 00:17:31,026
of the Dragon Mountain Empire.

420
00:17:31,345 --> 00:17:32,306
Then, I practiced

421
00:17:32,466 --> 00:17:33,625
the Forbidden Technique

422
00:17:33,865 --> 00:17:35,185
and finally became

423
00:17:35,185 --> 00:17:36,905
a real Demon Clan Emissary.

424
00:17:37,145 --> 00:17:38,226
I will devote

425
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,345
my entire life to Demon God.

426
00:17:41,385 --> 00:17:43,345
After pledging loyalty to Demon God,

427
00:17:44,185 --> 00:17:45,585
who would have

428
00:17:45,585 --> 00:17:47,425
a second opinion about it?

429
00:17:47,986 --> 00:17:48,786
(It's him.)

430
00:17:49,266 --> 00:17:50,306
(The Gray Robe.)

431
00:17:51,026 --> 00:17:52,585
Why do we have to be hidden

432
00:17:52,585 --> 00:17:54,266
in the Dark Abyss?

433
00:17:54,506 --> 00:17:55,746
Everything here

434
00:17:56,026 --> 00:17:57,585
belongs to us.

435
00:17:57,786 --> 00:17:59,105
Everything belongs to us.

436
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,145
No one would know that

437
00:18:01,425 --> 00:18:03,546
the well-known Lu's Fort

438
00:18:03,746 --> 00:18:05,986
is actually a branch of the Demon Clan.

439
00:18:06,345 --> 00:18:08,145
The almighty Demon God

440
00:18:08,425 --> 00:18:09,625
will definitely make us

441
00:18:09,625 --> 00:18:11,345
the most distinguished people.

442
00:18:11,585 --> 00:18:12,905
The most distinguished.

443
00:18:12,986 --> 00:18:14,345
Demon God's plan

444
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:16,145
is finally about to begin.

445
00:18:17,625 --> 00:18:18,345
Who's there?

446
00:18:26,026 --> 00:18:26,946
It's you?

447
00:18:59,889 --> 00:19:02,040
(Dark Ice Spear Technique, Ice Fire)

448
00:19:50,185 --> 00:19:50,825
Wait.

449
00:19:52,546 --> 00:19:53,345
I dare you

450
00:19:53,546 --> 00:19:54,905
to wait for me to draw energy.

451
00:19:56,665 --> 00:19:58,066
I haven't finished yet.

452
00:20:04,026 --> 00:20:04,946
Your Lordship.

453
00:20:05,905 --> 00:20:06,946
Your Lordship.

454
00:20:10,066 --> 00:20:11,905
So he doesn't have a heart.

455
00:20:12,306 --> 00:20:13,905
You fools.

456
00:20:14,266 --> 00:20:15,385
I will demonstrate

457
00:20:15,385 --> 00:20:16,865
the Forbidden Technique again

458
00:20:17,026 --> 00:20:17,905
and show you

459
00:20:17,905 --> 00:20:19,385
what we're capable of.

460
00:20:19,786 --> 00:20:20,585
Your Lordship.

461
00:20:20,786 --> 00:20:21,946
Draw my energy.

462
00:20:26,968 --> 00:20:29,240
(Descension of Blood Demon)

463
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:56,946
Master.

464
00:20:56,986 --> 00:20:57,706
Listen to me.

465
00:20:57,746 --> 00:20:58,145
You...

466
00:20:58,466 --> 00:20:59,466
Master, wait.

467
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:00,466
Wait, well...

468
00:21:00,585 --> 00:21:01,865
J-Just...

469
00:21:02,185 --> 00:21:03,585
J-Just now...

470
00:21:03,625 --> 00:21:04,306
Just now...

471
00:21:06,665 --> 00:21:07,466
Well...

472
00:21:07,625 --> 00:21:08,546
Something's wrong

473
00:21:08,546 --> 00:21:09,706
at Lu's Fort in Qutai City.

474
00:21:09,986 --> 00:21:11,506
Lu Huairu bought all the source stones

475
00:21:11,506 --> 00:21:12,585
and hid them in candles.

476
00:21:12,585 --> 00:21:13,706
Jingqiu, Xueying, Youyue, and I

477
00:21:13,706 --> 00:21:14,105
believe

478
00:21:14,105 --> 00:21:14,946
something's off.

479
00:21:14,946 --> 00:21:15,865
The three of them

480
00:21:15,905 --> 00:21:16,825
have entered the fort.

481
00:21:16,825 --> 00:21:17,786
I came back...

482
00:21:18,706 --> 00:21:19,546
to inform you.

483
00:21:20,625 --> 00:21:21,786
Lu's Fort.

484
00:21:22,385 --> 00:21:23,905
Isn't Lu Huairu a businessman?

485
00:21:24,385 --> 00:21:25,986
Why's he involved with the Demon Clan?

486
00:22:05,706 --> 00:22:07,266
Master, they're right...

487
00:22:09,506 --> 00:22:11,105
Let's go save them!

488
00:22:21,825 --> 00:22:22,546
Youyue.

489
00:22:22,786 --> 00:22:23,706
Get up.

490
00:22:23,825 --> 00:22:24,625
Youyue.

491
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,585
Puyang Bo, here.

492
00:22:28,905 --> 00:22:29,746
Youyue.

493
00:22:41,425 --> 00:22:41,946
Jingqiu.

494
00:22:41,946 --> 00:22:42,946
Be careful.

495
00:22:47,625 --> 00:22:48,306
Master.

496
00:23:02,306 --> 00:23:04,066
Master, Xueying is still in there.

497
00:23:07,585 --> 00:23:08,185
Youyue.

498
00:23:13,066 --> 00:23:13,825
Jingqiu.

499
00:23:16,786 --> 00:23:17,546
Jingqiu.

500
00:23:18,786 --> 00:23:20,185
Master, Jingqiu...

501
00:23:23,145 --> 00:23:24,506
I can't defeat Knight Changfeng.

502
00:23:24,506 --> 00:23:25,746
Keep the source stones first.

503
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,786
Master, Jingqiu...

504
00:23:41,066 --> 00:23:41,746
Master.

505
00:23:43,625 --> 00:23:44,306
Xueying.

506
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:47,425
Xueying.

507
00:23:48,066 --> 00:23:48,865
Xueying.

508
00:23:48,865 --> 00:23:49,385
Youyue.

509
00:23:49,786 --> 00:23:50,345
Don't go.

510
00:23:50,345 --> 00:23:51,425
Xueying.

511
00:24:11,986 --> 00:24:12,585
Brother.

512
00:24:14,425 --> 00:24:15,105
Brother.

513
00:24:16,385 --> 00:24:17,145
Are you okay?

514
00:24:17,145 --> 00:24:18,066
I'm fine.

515
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:25,345
Jingqiu.

516
00:24:26,185 --> 00:24:27,026
Xueying.

517
00:24:27,665 --> 00:24:28,546
Xueying.

518
00:24:31,946 --> 00:24:33,385
Xueying, let me be.

519
00:24:33,466 --> 00:24:34,466
Run!

520
00:25:20,746 --> 00:25:23,105
Xueying, are...

521
00:25:23,506 --> 00:25:24,986
Are you okay?

522
00:25:25,226 --> 00:25:26,226
I'm fine.

523
00:25:26,865 --> 00:25:27,466
Can...

524
00:25:27,986 --> 00:25:29,865
Can you please move to the left?

525
00:25:34,665 --> 00:25:35,506
Like this?

526
00:25:36,585 --> 00:25:37,905
A little bit more.

527
00:25:37,986 --> 00:25:38,585
Okay.

528
00:25:41,506 --> 00:25:42,345
Is it fine now?

529
00:26:11,066 --> 00:26:11,746
Xueying.

530
00:26:11,746 --> 00:26:12,266
Don't go.

531
00:26:13,306 --> 00:26:14,585
Youyue, listen to me.

532
00:26:14,665 --> 00:26:15,425
We can't go there.

533
00:26:15,425 --> 00:26:16,585
It's very dangerous.

534
00:26:16,585 --> 00:26:17,546
We can't watch

535
00:26:17,546 --> 00:26:18,506
Xueying die.

536
00:26:18,506 --> 00:26:19,665
He's still in there.

537
00:26:19,665 --> 00:26:20,345
Puyang Bo.

538
00:26:20,506 --> 00:26:21,546
Let me save him, okay?

539
00:26:21,546 --> 00:26:23,145
I can't watch you die, either.

540
00:26:23,425 --> 00:26:24,385
Xueying.

541
00:26:24,466 --> 00:26:25,385
Youyue.

542
00:26:25,385 --> 00:26:25,865
Let go!

543
00:26:25,865 --> 00:26:26,546
Youyue.

544
00:26:26,546 --> 00:26:27,466
Where are they?

545
00:26:27,825 --> 00:26:29,306
Still in there.

546
00:26:29,466 --> 00:26:30,226
Master.

547
00:26:31,706 --> 00:26:32,466
Master.

548
00:26:32,585 --> 00:26:33,425
It's fine, Youyue.

549
00:26:34,746 --> 00:26:35,506
Master went

550
00:26:35,506 --> 00:26:36,145
in there.

551
00:26:36,145 --> 00:26:37,385
It's okay now.

552
00:26:37,865 --> 00:26:38,946
Xueying.

553
00:26:43,706 --> 00:26:45,385
- It's Xueying.
- Xueying.

554
00:26:45,865 --> 00:26:46,625
Xueying.

555
00:26:46,625 --> 00:26:48,066
I knew you'd be fine.

556
00:26:48,066 --> 00:26:48,986
Are you hurt?

557
00:26:49,185 --> 00:26:50,345
Jingqiu, are you hurt?

558
00:26:51,185 --> 00:26:51,986
I told you

559
00:26:51,986 --> 00:26:52,905
they'd be fine.

560
00:26:52,905 --> 00:26:53,905
You're a grown girl

561
00:26:53,905 --> 00:26:54,986
and still a crybaby.

562
00:26:55,105 --> 00:26:55,746
Weren't you

563
00:26:55,746 --> 00:26:57,066
as nervous as me?

564
00:27:00,905 --> 00:27:01,585
Jingqiu.

565
00:27:02,026 --> 00:27:02,946
Let's go back.

566
00:27:03,506 --> 00:27:04,105
Let's go.

567
00:27:07,828 --> 00:27:10,392
(Changfeng Academy)

568
00:27:16,345 --> 00:27:17,266
How is she, Master?

569
00:27:17,706 --> 00:27:18,625
She's fine.

570
00:27:18,865 --> 00:27:19,986
Let her rest.

571
00:27:31,905 --> 00:27:32,706
I'll do it.

572
00:27:39,145 --> 00:27:40,345
Since she's fine,

573
00:27:40,625 --> 00:27:41,865
let's go out first.

574
00:27:42,665 --> 00:27:44,026
I will take care of her.

575
00:27:44,026 --> 00:27:45,306
Rest assured.

576
00:27:45,506 --> 00:27:46,585
If anything happens,

577
00:27:46,825 --> 00:27:47,825
come and get me.

578
00:27:47,946 --> 00:27:48,585
Okay.

579
00:27:50,466 --> 00:27:51,185
Let's go, Xueying.

580
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:01,345
Xueying, you're also hurt.

581
00:28:01,345 --> 00:28:02,506
Go get some rest.

582
00:28:28,786 --> 00:28:29,546
Are you okay?

583
00:28:30,266 --> 00:28:31,105
You're back.

584
00:28:32,786 --> 00:28:34,226
Dongbo Xueying.

585
00:28:36,385 --> 00:28:37,506
What's wrong with you?

586
00:28:37,986 --> 00:28:39,665
You sent us to look around.

587
00:28:39,746 --> 00:28:40,625
And you

588
00:28:40,706 --> 00:28:42,385
came back to the academy first.

589
00:28:42,625 --> 00:28:43,546
Were you trying

590
00:28:43,546 --> 00:28:44,385
to get us killed?

591
00:28:44,385 --> 00:28:45,226
Borong.

592
00:28:45,385 --> 00:28:47,345
Xueying was also in deep trouble.

593
00:28:47,425 --> 00:28:48,546
Lu's Fort got blasted today.

594
00:28:48,546 --> 00:28:49,585
He barely made it back.

595
00:28:49,585 --> 00:28:50,825
It was a narrow escape.

596
00:28:51,145 --> 00:28:52,585
So stop complaining.

597
00:28:52,706 --> 00:28:53,546
I'm sorry.

598
00:28:53,946 --> 00:28:54,786
We noticed someone

599
00:28:54,786 --> 00:28:55,986
buying out source stones

600
00:28:56,145 --> 00:28:57,506
so we followed them.

601
00:28:57,946 --> 00:28:58,665
Lu's Fort turned out

602
00:28:58,905 --> 00:29:00,425
to be a branch of the Demon Clan.

603
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:02,425
Lu's Fort is their branch?

604
00:29:02,425 --> 00:29:03,105
Yeah.

605
00:29:03,185 --> 00:29:04,546
At first, we didn't know either.

606
00:29:04,905 --> 00:29:05,706
We followed them

607
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,066
and got exposed.

608
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:08,946
Jingqiu was hurt and passed out.

609
00:29:09,266 --> 00:29:10,345
Then we rushed back.

610
00:29:10,466 --> 00:29:11,986
Jingqiu passed out?

611
00:29:13,506 --> 00:29:14,226
She...

612
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:15,066
Brother.

613
00:29:15,066 --> 00:29:15,825
Is she fine?

614
00:29:16,506 --> 00:29:17,226
She's fine.

615
00:29:17,585 --> 00:29:18,425
Dean checked her

616
00:29:18,625 --> 00:29:19,746
and said she was fine.

617
00:29:20,825 --> 00:29:21,746
That's good.

618
00:29:22,665 --> 00:29:24,466
I'll visit her tomorrow.

619
00:29:25,585 --> 00:29:26,665
Dongbo Xueying.

620
00:29:26,905 --> 00:29:28,825
Stop using Yu Jingqiu as an excuse.

621
00:29:29,026 --> 00:29:30,185
We've learned our lesson.

622
00:29:30,706 --> 00:29:31,345
We will never

623
00:29:31,345 --> 00:29:32,385
trust you again.

624
00:29:32,466 --> 00:29:33,185
Borong.

625
00:29:33,665 --> 00:29:34,466
Borong.

626
00:29:36,306 --> 00:29:37,506
Please don't mind him.

627
00:29:43,825 --> 00:29:44,825
Second Priest.

628
00:29:45,266 --> 00:29:46,585
Second Priest, bad news.

629
00:29:47,145 --> 00:29:48,105
Second Priest.

630
00:29:49,066 --> 00:29:49,946
Second Priest.

631
00:29:50,425 --> 00:29:51,825
Lu's Fort got destroyed.

632
00:29:52,266 --> 00:29:53,466
All 100,000 source stones

633
00:29:53,706 --> 00:29:55,625
were snatched by Chi Qiubai.

634
00:29:57,425 --> 00:29:58,986
What did you say?

635
00:30:05,546 --> 00:30:07,145
It was Dongbo Xueying.

636
00:30:07,266 --> 00:30:08,905
He discovered the secret of Lu's Fort

637
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:11,425
and brought Chi Qiubai there.

638
00:30:13,986 --> 00:30:15,665
Source stones.

639
00:30:22,105 --> 00:30:23,105
The Demon Clan gathered

640
00:30:23,105 --> 00:30:23,986
100,000 source stones.

641
00:30:24,425 --> 00:30:25,585
I snatched all of them

642
00:30:25,585 --> 00:30:26,506
from Lu's Fort

643
00:30:26,506 --> 00:30:27,185
today.

644
00:30:27,585 --> 00:30:28,266
I intended to

645
00:30:28,266 --> 00:30:29,706
capture the demon, too.

646
00:30:30,185 --> 00:30:31,665
But he got away.

647
00:31:00,406 --> 00:31:02,296
(Boundless Void)

648
00:31:37,665 --> 00:31:39,665
I can't believe the Demon Clan collected

649
00:31:39,706 --> 00:31:40,665
100,000 source stones

650
00:31:40,665 --> 00:31:42,066
in our empire.

651
00:31:42,385 --> 00:31:43,865
We should be alert now.

652
00:31:44,105 --> 00:31:45,625
We don't know

653
00:31:45,625 --> 00:31:47,625
how many branches they have.

654
00:31:48,026 --> 00:31:50,185
It's a critical situation.

655
00:31:50,466 --> 00:31:51,266
Thankfully, we have

656
00:31:51,266 --> 00:31:52,066
the source stones.

657
00:31:52,145 --> 00:31:53,026
The Demon Clan's plan

658
00:31:53,266 --> 00:31:54,786
won't go so well.

659
00:31:55,185 --> 00:31:56,546
They will definitely try

660
00:31:56,625 --> 00:31:58,506
to retrieve the source stones.

661
00:31:58,706 --> 00:32:00,105
Why don't we keep them

662
00:32:00,105 --> 00:32:01,546
at our Temple of the Earth God?

663
00:32:02,026 --> 00:32:03,665
We will guard them

664
00:32:03,905 --> 00:32:05,066
very carefully.

665
00:32:05,185 --> 00:32:06,546
We have more disciples

666
00:32:06,546 --> 00:32:08,066
and they're more cultivated.

667
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:10,466
Why don't we keep them at my place?

668
00:32:10,585 --> 00:32:11,986
Then I won't worry so much.

669
00:32:12,066 --> 00:32:13,105
Your Water Daoist Temple

670
00:32:13,105 --> 00:32:14,825
just lost the Ocean Realm Stone.

671
00:32:14,825 --> 00:32:15,746
Remember?

672
00:32:15,746 --> 00:32:16,425
Tai Shu.

673
00:32:16,466 --> 00:32:18,066
What did I say wrong?

674
00:32:18,185 --> 00:32:19,145
I can't trust

675
00:32:19,145 --> 00:32:20,226
your defense.

676
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:23,506
How about Fog City?

677
00:32:27,266 --> 00:32:29,905
I'm afraid our guarding force
at Fog City is too weak

678
00:32:30,026 --> 00:32:31,266
for this task.

679
00:32:31,585 --> 00:32:33,066
Your Forbidden Zone of Source Stones

680
00:32:33,226 --> 00:32:33,946
is well-guarded

681
00:32:33,946 --> 00:32:34,746
with many traps.

682
00:32:35,026 --> 00:32:36,266
Even ten Transcendents

683
00:32:36,385 --> 00:32:37,466
may not break through.

684
00:32:37,665 --> 00:32:38,905
I think the source stones

685
00:32:38,905 --> 00:32:40,026
will be safe there.

686
00:32:41,425 --> 00:32:42,226
Xiaoxi.

687
00:32:42,665 --> 00:32:44,345
Your Double Fans with Chunyuan

688
00:32:44,466 --> 00:32:45,506
is quite powerful.

689
00:32:48,266 --> 00:32:50,625
Fine, let's keep them at Fog City.

690
00:33:20,105 --> 00:33:23,185
(How is she doing now?)

691
00:33:39,466 --> 00:33:40,665
Jingqiu, you woke up.

692
00:33:41,506 --> 00:33:42,306
Jingqiu.

693
00:33:42,585 --> 00:33:43,266
How are you?

694
00:33:43,345 --> 00:33:44,425
Feeling better?

695
00:33:44,466 --> 00:33:45,506
Have you recovered a bit?

696
00:33:45,665 --> 00:33:47,506
I feel much better after the sleep.

697
00:33:48,105 --> 00:33:49,026
That's good.

698
00:33:50,345 --> 00:33:52,986
Your color looks better.

699
00:33:53,226 --> 00:33:54,585
I guess you've recovered.

700
00:33:58,425 --> 00:33:59,986
You slept well,

701
00:34:00,226 --> 00:34:02,026
but we barely closed our eyes.

702
00:34:02,145 --> 00:34:03,026
We accepted gifts

703
00:34:03,026 --> 00:34:04,466
on your behalf the whole morning.

704
00:34:04,786 --> 00:34:06,546
Check out my dark circles.

705
00:34:07,266 --> 00:34:08,506
What are these?

706
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:09,185
Well...

707
00:34:09,185 --> 00:34:10,185
People heard that

708
00:34:10,185 --> 00:34:11,946
you got hurt fighting the Demon Clan.

709
00:34:12,665 --> 00:34:13,946
To show concern,

710
00:34:13,946 --> 00:34:15,546
they brought you restoratives

711
00:34:15,546 --> 00:34:16,265
and food.

712
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,185
Concern?

713
00:34:18,185 --> 00:34:20,826
I'd say there's a lot more to it.

714
00:34:21,026 --> 00:34:22,346
Look.

715
00:34:22,745 --> 00:34:24,105
All the gifts from Situ Hong

716
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:26,305
are top-quality items.

717
00:34:26,906 --> 00:34:28,906
Xueying risked himself to save her.

718
00:34:28,906 --> 00:34:31,105
Then Situ Hong sent her precious gifts.

719
00:34:32,986 --> 00:34:34,506
Yu Jingqiu.

720
00:34:34,665 --> 00:34:36,346
That's impressive.

721
00:34:39,665 --> 00:34:41,346
(I wonder if Xueying)

722
00:34:41,346 --> 00:34:42,225
(is getting better.)

723
00:34:43,225 --> 00:34:44,386
Xueying was amazing.

724
00:34:44,426 --> 00:34:45,466
I've told you long ago.

725
00:34:45,745 --> 00:34:46,785
Dongbo Xueying

726
00:34:46,785 --> 00:34:47,866
is definitely a talent.

727
00:34:47,866 --> 00:34:48,906
And he spread his wings.

728
00:34:49,185 --> 00:34:50,386
I heard that our dean

729
00:34:50,466 --> 00:34:51,866
praised him for destroying

730
00:34:51,906 --> 00:34:53,145
the branch of the Demon Clan.

731
00:34:53,265 --> 00:34:53,826
Really?

732
00:34:53,826 --> 00:34:54,386
Brother.

733
00:34:54,866 --> 00:34:55,466
Dongbo Xueying

734
00:34:55,466 --> 00:34:56,986
told us to search for the demons.

735
00:34:57,145 --> 00:34:58,466
We were in grave danger

736
00:34:58,506 --> 00:34:59,826
and barely made it back.

737
00:34:59,866 --> 00:35:01,466
Now, he's the hero.

738
00:35:01,466 --> 00:35:02,386
Why?

739
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:03,625
He did destroy the branch

740
00:35:03,625 --> 00:35:04,506
of the Demon Clan.

741
00:35:04,506 --> 00:35:05,986
But didn't we contribute to it?

742
00:35:06,546 --> 00:35:08,026
I can't take it anymore.

743
00:35:08,066 --> 00:35:09,066
I'll talk to the dean.

744
00:35:09,066 --> 00:35:09,986
Come on.

745
00:35:10,665 --> 00:35:11,386
We didn't catch

746
00:35:11,386 --> 00:35:12,346
any demons, after all.

747
00:35:12,785 --> 00:35:14,906
How are we qualified for praise?

748
00:35:15,145 --> 00:35:17,105
Look at my wound.

749
00:35:17,386 --> 00:35:18,386
It's true that

750
00:35:18,386 --> 00:35:19,665
we didn't catch any demon.

751
00:35:19,705 --> 00:35:21,386
But we were against

752
00:35:21,546 --> 00:35:23,185
a dozen demons by ourselves.

753
00:35:23,265 --> 00:35:24,625
We did our best.

754
00:35:24,986 --> 00:35:25,665
How about this?

755
00:35:25,826 --> 00:35:26,785
I'll treat you

756
00:35:27,466 --> 00:35:28,986
to roasted chicken one day.

757
00:35:33,145 --> 00:35:33,906
Jingqiu.

758
00:35:41,145 --> 00:35:41,866
How...

759
00:35:42,066 --> 00:35:43,506
How are you feeling now?

760
00:35:43,665 --> 00:35:44,785
I'm already fine.

761
00:35:44,866 --> 00:35:46,265
Thank you for the restoratives.

762
00:35:46,745 --> 00:35:47,426
By the way,

763
00:35:47,745 --> 00:35:48,906
I heard you two

764
00:35:48,946 --> 00:35:49,866
fought demons alone.

765
00:35:49,866 --> 00:35:50,866
Are you badly hurt?

766
00:35:52,585 --> 00:35:53,625
Not really.

767
00:35:54,185 --> 00:35:55,386
Don't worry.

768
00:35:57,346 --> 00:35:59,026
This crystal can help you heal.

769
00:35:59,026 --> 00:35:59,906
Take it.

770
00:36:01,346 --> 00:36:02,225
I knew it.

771
00:36:02,225 --> 00:36:03,426
Jingqiu is the best.

772
00:36:03,466 --> 00:36:04,665
Thank you.

773
00:36:04,866 --> 00:36:06,026
Someone has crystals

774
00:36:06,185 --> 00:36:07,305
but doesn't

775
00:36:07,305 --> 00:36:08,305
give me any.

776
00:36:09,986 --> 00:36:10,866
I'm sorry.

777
00:36:10,866 --> 00:36:12,185
Xueying and I

778
00:36:12,185 --> 00:36:13,745
got into trouble at Lu's Fort.

779
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:15,466
We should have supported you.

780
00:36:15,745 --> 00:36:16,426
Then

781
00:36:16,426 --> 00:36:17,105
you wouldn't

782
00:36:17,105 --> 00:36:18,346
have fought alone.

783
00:36:18,705 --> 00:36:20,625
It's not your fault.

784
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:21,986
Don't be bothered.

785
00:36:23,145 --> 00:36:24,826
I feel guilty about

786
00:36:25,066 --> 00:36:26,906
what happened at Lu's Fort.

787
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:28,625
After all, those demons

788
00:36:28,625 --> 00:36:29,866
were let out from

789
00:36:29,866 --> 00:36:30,665
Nanqin City.

790
00:36:30,906 --> 00:36:32,305
We should be the ones

791
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:33,546
to take them down.

792
00:36:33,866 --> 00:36:34,625
But

793
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,346
we failed to do anything.

794
00:36:37,665 --> 00:36:38,585
Situ Hong.

795
00:36:38,745 --> 00:36:39,665
Don't think like that.

796
00:36:39,906 --> 00:36:40,826
After all,

797
00:36:40,826 --> 00:36:42,066
we destroyed the branch

798
00:36:42,066 --> 00:36:43,386
and stalled their plan

799
00:36:43,466 --> 00:36:44,906
because of your help.

800
00:36:45,145 --> 00:36:46,225
If you hadn't stalled

801
00:36:46,225 --> 00:36:47,066
all the demons

802
00:36:47,066 --> 00:36:47,986
around Lu's Fort,

803
00:36:47,986 --> 00:36:49,225
Xueying and I

804
00:36:49,225 --> 00:36:50,506
couldn't have gotten out.

805
00:36:50,785 --> 00:36:52,466
Others may not know the truth,

806
00:36:52,466 --> 00:36:53,506
but Xueying and I

807
00:36:53,506 --> 00:36:54,705
know very well.

808
00:36:56,066 --> 00:36:57,265
You're the true heroes

809
00:36:57,466 --> 00:36:58,346
who dare to fight

810
00:36:58,346 --> 00:36:59,625
a bunch of demons alone.

811
00:36:59,705 --> 00:37:00,585
Situ Hong.

812
00:37:00,785 --> 00:37:01,785
You're outstanding

813
00:37:01,785 --> 00:37:02,946
and truly brave.

814
00:37:02,946 --> 00:37:03,946
You're amazing.

815
00:37:04,026 --> 00:37:05,826
No wonder you're the best student here.

816
00:37:07,785 --> 00:37:09,265
T-T-Thank you.

817
00:37:09,265 --> 00:37:10,665
J-Jingqiu.

818
00:37:10,986 --> 00:37:11,745
See you around.

819
00:37:13,665 --> 00:37:14,745
I knew it.

820
00:37:14,745 --> 00:37:15,426
Jingqiu

821
00:37:15,426 --> 00:37:16,466
knows everything

822
00:37:16,785 --> 00:37:18,346
and she cares about me.

823
00:37:23,386 --> 00:37:24,946
And you, too.

824
00:37:39,466 --> 00:37:40,426
These were all dreams.

825
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:41,225
Not real.

826
00:37:42,946 --> 00:37:43,665
Thank you.

827
00:37:44,026 --> 00:37:44,785
You're welcome.

828
00:37:51,906 --> 00:37:52,866
Situ Hong.

829
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:53,986
Are you all right?

830
00:37:54,026 --> 00:37:55,745
Thank you.

831
00:37:57,066 --> 00:37:58,906
This crystal can help you heal.

832
00:37:58,906 --> 00:38:00,026
Take it.

833
00:38:11,546 --> 00:38:12,585
Brother, take it.

834
00:38:14,026 --> 00:38:14,826
Brother.

835
00:38:14,946 --> 00:38:16,225
What's going on?

836
00:38:16,946 --> 00:38:18,705
You can't even catch a pear?

837
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:23,066
Brother, don't tell me...

838
00:38:24,986 --> 00:38:25,946
What?

839
00:38:25,946 --> 00:38:28,225
Are you in love?

840
00:38:28,665 --> 00:38:29,426
You...

841
00:38:29,986 --> 00:38:31,305
My brother is in love.

842
00:38:31,386 --> 00:38:33,066
My brother is in love.

843
00:38:34,346 --> 00:38:35,185
Is...

844
00:38:36,225 --> 00:38:37,546
Is it that obvious?

845
00:38:43,426 --> 00:38:45,105
Ten qian of Lingcao herb.

846
00:38:45,265 --> 00:38:46,906
How much is ten qian?

847
00:38:47,305 --> 00:38:48,665
Three qian of Ophiopogon root.

848
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:50,225
Two qian of teasel root.

849
00:38:50,225 --> 00:38:51,665
Two qian of Schisandra.

850
00:38:51,785 --> 00:38:53,866
Three qian of sliced ginger.

851
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:55,826
Deerhorn Glue...

852
00:39:03,225 --> 00:39:04,346
Training all day.

853
00:39:04,346 --> 00:39:05,466
I'm exhausted.

854
00:39:05,826 --> 00:39:06,506
Brother.

855
00:39:06,625 --> 00:39:07,305
Why did you

856
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:08,305
practice so hard today?

857
00:39:08,305 --> 00:39:09,986
You aren't usually like that.

858
00:39:10,426 --> 00:39:11,866
We ran into the demons

859
00:39:11,986 --> 00:39:13,305
but didn't catch them.

860
00:39:13,625 --> 00:39:14,826
Our cultivation

861
00:39:14,826 --> 00:39:15,826
needs improvement.

862
00:39:15,946 --> 00:39:18,105
So we should work harder.

863
00:39:18,185 --> 00:39:18,826
You

864
00:39:18,826 --> 00:39:20,386
are too harsh on yourself.

865
00:39:23,346 --> 00:39:24,506
What a nice smell, Brother.

866
00:39:24,745 --> 00:39:26,145
I'm starving.

867
00:39:26,305 --> 00:39:27,225
Let's see

868
00:39:27,225 --> 00:39:27,866
if there is

869
00:39:27,866 --> 00:39:28,625
anything for us.

870
00:39:28,946 --> 00:39:29,546
Let's go.

871
00:39:29,785 --> 00:39:30,386
Let's go.

872
00:39:35,426 --> 00:39:37,105
What a nice Lingcao herb soup.

873
00:39:37,105 --> 00:39:38,145
I want a bowl of it.

874
00:39:40,305 --> 00:39:41,145
Get lost.

875
00:39:41,665 --> 00:39:42,906
Youyue,

876
00:39:43,185 --> 00:39:44,426
you are so pretty.

877
00:39:44,426 --> 00:39:45,826
I bet you're very kind.

878
00:39:45,986 --> 00:39:47,546
Just give me some soup.

879
00:39:47,546 --> 00:39:49,386
Can you stay away from me?

880
00:39:49,745 --> 00:39:50,506
How about this?

881
00:39:50,906 --> 00:39:51,665
Name a price.

882
00:39:51,665 --> 00:39:52,346
I'll pay

883
00:39:52,386 --> 00:39:53,466
however much you ask for.

884
00:39:54,466 --> 00:39:55,506
Si Borong,

885
00:39:56,386 --> 00:39:57,946
were you so arrogant when you fought

886
00:39:57,946 --> 00:39:58,906
the demons?

887
00:39:59,705 --> 00:40:00,585
Si Borong.

888
00:40:02,145 --> 00:40:03,145
Let's find

889
00:40:03,265 --> 00:40:04,546
something else to eat.

890
00:40:05,386 --> 00:40:06,346
Youyue,

891
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:08,185
may I use the stove

892
00:40:08,346 --> 00:40:09,426
once you're done

893
00:40:09,426 --> 00:40:10,546
with it?

894
00:40:12,546 --> 00:40:13,265
Step aside.

895
00:40:21,386 --> 00:40:21,986
Here.

896
00:40:23,866 --> 00:40:25,145
How do we eat this?

897
00:40:25,145 --> 00:40:26,305
Soak it in cold water?

898
00:40:26,986 --> 00:40:28,265
Eat it when it's softened.

899
00:40:32,906 --> 00:40:33,625
Come here.

900
00:40:38,946 --> 00:40:39,665
Si Borong.

901
00:40:40,866 --> 00:40:42,426
It's highly inappropriate

902
00:40:42,426 --> 00:40:43,625
to take someone else's things

903
00:40:43,826 --> 00:40:45,585
without permission.

904
00:40:45,986 --> 00:40:47,466
They will look down on you.

905
00:40:51,866 --> 00:40:52,585
Brother.

906
00:40:53,105 --> 00:40:54,986
Youyue didn't say yes.

907
00:40:55,105 --> 00:40:56,705
But neither did she say no.

908
00:40:57,185 --> 00:40:58,386
I guess nothing matters

909
00:40:58,665 --> 00:41:00,026
more than your reputation.

910
00:41:02,625 --> 00:41:03,426
Forget it.

911
00:41:03,665 --> 00:41:05,426
I'll go find something to eat.

912
00:41:05,625 --> 00:41:06,506
Wait for me.

913
00:41:12,946 --> 00:41:14,705
(If I had been the one who entered)

914
00:41:15,185 --> 00:41:16,946
(and found out that it was the branch,)

915
00:41:17,386 --> 00:41:19,145
(I would have fought the demon, too.)

916
00:41:19,386 --> 00:41:21,265
(I would be the hero everyone admires.)

917
00:41:22,506 --> 00:41:24,346
(I swear I'll be outstanding.)

918
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:27,066
(No one shall look down on me.)

919
00:41:28,185 --> 00:41:29,225
(Xueying.)

920
00:41:29,506 --> 00:41:30,305
(You're just)

921
00:41:30,305 --> 00:41:31,665
(luckier than me this time.)

922
00:41:32,225 --> 00:41:33,305
(Next time,)

923
00:41:34,105 --> 00:41:35,785
(I won't lose to you.)

924
00:41:36,585 --> 00:41:37,745
I deserve to die.

925
00:41:38,145 --> 00:41:39,506
If it serves anything to kill you,

926
00:41:39,506 --> 00:41:41,426
you'd be dead a hundred times.

927
00:41:42,225 --> 00:41:44,585
The Great Demon God's plan has begun.

928
00:41:44,906 --> 00:41:47,066
If we can't take down
the Demon Well in time,

929
00:41:47,066 --> 00:41:49,105
it won't be enough
to kill you 1000 times,

930
00:41:49,105 --> 00:41:50,066
10,000 times,

931
00:41:50,066 --> 00:41:52,066
or a million times

932
00:41:52,066 --> 00:41:52,946
in the Dark Abyss.

933
00:41:53,225 --> 00:41:54,625
Please give me another chance.

934
00:41:54,866 --> 00:41:56,225
If I fail again,

935
00:41:56,546 --> 00:41:58,066
I will take any punishment.

936
00:41:58,346 --> 00:41:59,665
We're about to take action.

937
00:41:59,745 --> 00:42:01,305
But the branch got destroyed,

938
00:42:01,625 --> 00:42:03,145
and the source stones
you got over the years

939
00:42:03,145 --> 00:42:04,386
were gone.

940
00:42:04,665 --> 00:42:05,745
It's almost impossible

941
00:42:05,745 --> 00:42:07,986
to get so many source stones

942
00:42:08,026 --> 00:42:09,546
in a short time.

943
00:42:09,785 --> 00:42:11,265
High Priest,

944
00:42:11,466 --> 00:42:12,866
what do you think we should do?

945
00:42:13,105 --> 00:42:14,585
There are things we can do.

946
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:15,625
However,

947
00:42:15,625 --> 00:42:17,265
it may be a bit risky.

948
00:42:17,265 --> 00:42:18,826
