Calm your mind and move less.

In motion,

24
00:02:39,070 --> 00:02:40,390
discard irrelevant thoughts.

25
00:02:40,591 --> 00:02:41,790
Concentrate the mind.

26
00:02:42,151 --> 00:02:43,630
At the pinnacle, an epiphany may strike.

27
00:02:53,871 --> 00:02:56,110
I really like your pendant.

28
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:57,390
Would you be willing to give it to me?

29
00:02:57,591 --> 00:02:58,751
This was left to me by my mother.

30
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:00,591
Well, can I play with it?

31
00:03:32,871 --> 00:03:33,790
Excuse me.

32
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:34,871
I have to practice now.

(Esoteric Demise)

34

(Esoteric Tide)

35
00:04:51,630 --> 00:04:53,311
Xueying, you can't interfere.

36
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:02,671
Stop.

37
00:05:03,351 --> 00:05:04,390
Hand over the antidote.

38
00:05:07,590 --> 00:05:08,950
He's new to the Xinhuo Palace,

39
00:05:09,191 --> 00:05:10,630
and he doesn't know the rules here.

40
00:05:10,751 --> 00:05:12,751
Let's call it a day.

41
00:05:13,270 --> 00:05:14,311
I'll say it again.

42
00:05:14,551 --> 00:05:15,751
Hand over the antidote.

43
00:05:16,191 --> 00:05:17,111
Xueying,

44
00:05:17,351 --> 00:05:18,791
in Xinhuo Palace,

45
00:05:18,911 --> 00:05:20,150
no one is allowed to interfere

46
00:05:20,270 --> 00:05:21,510
with other disciples' fights.

47
00:05:21,630 --> 00:05:23,231
I don't care about it.

48
00:05:23,470 --> 00:05:24,390
All I know is

49
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:25,671
that we entered the Xinhuo Palace

50
00:05:25,791 --> 00:05:26,791
to improve our cultivation

51
00:05:26,911 --> 00:05:27,751
to fight against the Demon Clan,

52
00:05:27,830 --> 00:05:29,191
not to kill each other.

53
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,791
I'm going in

54
00:05:30,871 --> 00:05:31,830
on this one today.

55
00:05:32,871 --> 00:05:34,470
You want to play a hero?

56
00:05:36,791 --> 00:05:38,551
Then I'll grant your wish.

57
00:06:16,366 --> 00:06:18,020
(Esoteric Infernal-Flame)

58
00:06:25,551 --> 00:06:26,590
Zhuo Yi,

59
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:27,751
are you not

60
00:06:27,751 --> 00:06:28,911
clear-headed enough today?

61
00:06:33,311 --> 00:06:34,630
One bottle of bee venom

62
00:06:34,830 --> 00:06:35,911
for your antidote.

63
00:06:41,111 --> 00:06:42,470
Two bottles.

64
00:06:42,710 --> 00:06:44,191
Don't push your luck.

65
00:06:44,311 --> 00:06:45,191
You know how hard it is

66
00:06:45,270 --> 00:06:46,351
to get this stuff.

67
00:06:53,911 --> 00:06:54,991
That's the antidote.

68
00:06:55,111 --> 00:06:56,351
Give it to Yu Feng quickly.

69
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:12,630
It took me half a year

70
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:14,270
to finally get that thing.

71
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:16,351
Dongbo Xueying.

72
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:23,791
Save your goodwill.

73
00:07:30,111 --> 00:07:30,911
Yu Feng,

74
00:07:31,030 --> 00:07:32,390
you're a loser in cultivation,

75
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,871
but your temper is pretty huge.

76
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:43,390
Why were you indifferent

77
00:07:43,431 --> 00:07:44,751
to what just happened?

78
00:07:45,070 --> 00:07:46,751
Do you all go for the kill

79
00:07:46,871 --> 00:07:48,111
during the internal fights?

80
00:07:48,231 --> 00:07:49,070
Yeah.

81
00:07:49,191 --> 00:07:50,551
You'll get used to it.

82
00:07:51,830 --> 00:07:52,751
Can I borrow

83
00:07:52,871 --> 00:07:54,191
your pendant for a couple of days?

84
00:07:54,311 --> 00:07:55,551
You haven't answered my question.

85
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:57,991
Anything wrong?

86
00:07:58,270 --> 00:08:00,311
One day you'll confront the Demon Clan,

87
00:08:00,431 --> 00:08:02,311
and they are much more ruthless than us.

88
00:08:02,710 --> 00:08:04,111
You are a new member.

89
00:08:04,191 --> 00:08:05,590
There must be many doubts in your mind.

90
00:08:05,950 --> 00:08:06,991
One of those two people

91
00:08:07,111 --> 00:08:08,270
is Wu Cang.

92
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:10,111
He is a disciple
of the Black White Deity Mountain.

93
00:08:10,590 --> 00:08:12,150
I heard you met him before

94
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:13,510
in the bamboo forest.

95
00:08:14,030 --> 00:08:15,710
The other is Yu Feng, a disciple

96
00:08:15,830 --> 00:08:16,671
of the Sea God Palace.

97
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:18,150
Master Tai Shu

98
00:08:18,191 --> 00:08:19,991
died in the war against the demons.

99
00:08:20,150 --> 00:08:21,111
Now what's on his mind

100
00:08:21,191 --> 00:08:22,671
is only to avenge the dead
from the Sea God Palace.

101
00:08:24,070 --> 00:08:24,950
What about you?

102
00:08:25,070 --> 00:08:26,270
How long have you been in this palace?

103
00:08:27,390 --> 00:08:28,431
Maybe,

104
00:08:28,751 --> 00:08:29,751
three years.

105
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:31,791
What about you?

106
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,671
The people here

107
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:35,590
are all from Transcendent organizations.

108
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:36,791
But you don't belong

109
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:38,551
to any one of them.

110
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:39,870
You must also have

111
00:08:39,911 --> 00:08:41,191
your own purpose.

112
00:08:42,110 --> 00:08:43,830
(Should I ask Zhuo Yi about)

113
00:08:44,031 --> 00:08:45,551
(the box?)

114
00:08:48,750 --> 00:08:49,590
Have you seen enough?

115
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:52,990
Can't I borrow it for a couple of days?

116
00:08:53,110 --> 00:08:53,830
I'll help you

117
00:08:53,830 --> 00:08:54,950
when you're in need in return.

118
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:40,830
Eating cooked food

119
00:09:40,911 --> 00:09:42,391
is good for wound healing.

120
00:09:44,671 --> 00:09:45,750
Take care of your injuries.

121
00:09:48,590 --> 00:09:49,350
Thanks.

122
00:10:09,431 --> 00:10:10,590
Mr. Good Samaritan,

123
00:10:10,590 --> 00:10:11,590
how about you

124
00:10:11,990 --> 00:10:12,911
give me yours?

125
00:10:23,870 --> 00:10:24,870
(It's poisoned.)

126
00:10:28,431 --> 00:10:30,710
Xueying, let me give you this.

127
00:10:31,990 --> 00:10:33,470
Mind your own business.

128
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:34,710
No thanks.

129
00:10:34,750 --> 00:10:35,950
Let's see.

130
00:10:36,070 --> 00:10:36,990
Give my stuff back.

131
00:10:37,110 --> 00:10:37,750
Give it to me.

132
00:11:02,431 --> 00:11:03,151
Xueying.

133
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:23,830
How did you get my antidote?

134
00:11:24,110 --> 00:11:25,191
When you just used your power

135
00:11:25,311 --> 00:11:26,551
to slap the table,

136
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:27,990
I took it.

137
00:11:55,870 --> 00:11:57,391
Look, what is this?

138
00:11:59,350 --> 00:12:00,750
This is fallen

139
00:12:00,750 --> 00:12:01,671
from the masked man.

140
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:06,830
This should be something
from the Xinhuo Palace.

141
00:12:14,590 --> 00:12:16,151
(He has a box, too.)

142
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:18,590
(The masked man's box is with me,)

143
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:19,870
(and Wu Cang also has one,)

144
00:12:20,431 --> 00:12:22,110
(so he's definitely not the masked man.)

145
00:12:22,631 --> 00:12:23,590
(But what is)

146
00:12:23,590 --> 00:12:24,710
(this box exactly?)

147
00:12:25,191 --> 00:12:26,110
(Does everyone in the palace)

148
00:12:26,110 --> 00:12:27,191
(have one?)

149
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:33,710
Take a seat, you guys.

150
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:49,551
What is this thing?

151
00:12:50,031 --> 00:12:50,830
You don't know?

152
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:52,151
No.

153
00:12:54,391 --> 00:12:55,511
Neither do I.

154
00:12:57,431 --> 00:12:58,830
(It's strange.)

155
00:12:59,151 --> 00:13:00,911
(Isn't it from the Xinhuo Palace?)

156
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,671
(Why haven't they seen it?)

157
00:13:03,311 --> 00:13:05,151
(And why does Wu Cang
have a similar one on himself?)

158
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:07,070
(If I ask him directly,)

159
00:13:07,070 --> 00:13:08,151
(I'll expose myself.)

160
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,311
Do you guys

161
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:11,631
know where Wu Cang lives?

162
00:13:11,830 --> 00:13:12,750
He

163
00:13:12,870 --> 00:13:14,230
lives in the fourth row
of bamboo buildings.

164
00:13:14,590 --> 00:13:15,750
You're going to go see him?

165
00:13:16,631 --> 00:13:18,391
I've got some stuff to do.
I'll leave you two.

166
00:13:22,631 --> 00:13:24,031
Come on.

167
00:13:24,031 --> 00:13:26,104
(Jingping Pavilion)

168
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,191
(Is he nuts?)

169
00:13:46,031 --> 00:13:47,431
(Being bitten by this thing,)

170
00:13:47,750 --> 00:13:48,950
(if he doesn't die,
he will also be half-dead.)

171
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:11,911
(So)

172
00:14:12,391 --> 00:14:13,311
(that is how he comprehends)

173
00:14:13,391 --> 00:14:14,470
(Esoteric Demise.)

174
00:14:15,110 --> 00:14:16,031
(Experiencing the near-death pain)

175
00:14:16,110 --> 00:14:17,870
(again and again)

176
00:14:18,271 --> 00:14:20,031
(to force his body and mind)

177
00:14:20,151 --> 00:14:21,151
(into a near-dead state)

178
00:14:21,191 --> 00:14:22,271
(repeatedly.)

179
00:14:23,271 --> 00:14:24,031
(In this way,)

180
00:14:24,350 --> 00:14:25,911
(he can be somewhat considered)

181
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:27,271
(to have achieved immortality.)

182
00:14:28,511 --> 00:14:30,391
(Those who practice this way)

183
00:14:31,151 --> 00:14:32,710
(are no different than desperadoes.)

184
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:02,911
(What is he going out for)

185
00:15:03,391 --> 00:15:04,710
(at this late hour?)

186
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:55,031
(What did Wu Cang take?)

187
00:15:55,791 --> 00:15:57,230
(Could it be these bugs?)

188
00:15:58,271 --> 00:15:59,511
(But what's the use)

189
00:15:59,631 --> 00:16:00,470
(of him taking these bugs?)

190
00:16:32,191 --> 00:16:33,110
(So smelly.)

191
00:16:33,830 --> 00:16:35,470
(What on earth is Wu Cang going to do?)

192
00:16:54,470 --> 00:16:55,950
Dongbo Xueying, get out of my way.

193
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:56,671
Are you crazy?

194
00:16:56,750 --> 00:16:57,791
You'll die.

195
00:17:17,470 --> 00:17:18,631
So it's a trap.

196
00:17:19,030 --> 00:17:20,310
You were trying to track down demons

197
00:17:20,310 --> 00:17:21,151
to find clues.

198
00:17:21,431 --> 00:17:22,871
You found out too late.

199
00:17:23,071 --> 00:17:23,790
You've already ruined

200
00:17:23,790 --> 00:17:24,790
our plan.

201
00:17:39,550 --> 00:17:41,191
It's all because you showed up early.

202
00:17:41,431 --> 00:17:42,391
Otherwise, I would have planted

203
00:17:42,391 --> 00:17:43,550
the smell inside their bodies.

204
00:17:43,790 --> 00:17:44,351
In that way,

205
00:17:44,351 --> 00:17:45,550
we will never lose track of them.

206
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:46,391
But that is

207
00:17:46,391 --> 00:17:47,230
too risky.

208
00:17:47,550 --> 00:17:48,631
My life

209
00:17:48,631 --> 00:17:49,911
has nothing to do with you.

210
00:17:51,270 --> 00:17:52,151
Xueying,

211
00:17:53,111 --> 00:17:54,391
your unauthorized actions

212
00:17:54,510 --> 00:17:55,151
interrupted

213
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:56,631
our plan.

214
00:17:56,831 --> 00:17:58,510
Do you know how long

215
00:17:58,631 --> 00:18:00,310
Wu Cang and I prepared for tonight?

216
00:18:00,631 --> 00:18:01,470
But thanks to

217
00:18:01,591 --> 00:18:02,871
your big brain,

218
00:18:03,151 --> 00:18:04,831
all is ruined.

219
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,631
I don't think

220
00:18:05,631 --> 00:18:07,071
you have to take such risks.

221
00:18:07,351 --> 00:18:08,750
After all, we only live once.

222
00:18:09,351 --> 00:18:10,710
I don't think I did anything wrong.

223
00:18:11,230 --> 00:18:13,391
Punish me as you please.

224
00:18:53,950 --> 00:18:55,671
Magic is forbidden in this dungeon.

225
00:18:57,351 --> 00:18:57,950
Oh, no.

226
00:19:13,631 --> 00:19:15,310
Xueying was trying to save you.

227
00:19:16,071 --> 00:19:17,710
I didn't ask him to save me.

228
00:19:18,431 --> 00:19:19,310
Wu Cang,

229
00:19:19,431 --> 00:19:20,871
you're really cold-blooded.

230
00:19:21,071 --> 00:19:22,550
Do you know, for a disciple

231
00:19:22,591 --> 00:19:23,631
who just entered
the Xinhuo Palace like him,

232
00:19:23,631 --> 00:19:24,631
the coldness of the Glacier Prison

233
00:19:24,750 --> 00:19:26,591
could make him die?

234
00:19:26,990 --> 00:19:28,270
That is a bitterly cold region

235
00:19:28,270 --> 00:19:29,230
of the Dragon Mountain Empire.

236
00:19:29,391 --> 00:19:30,310
Few people can withstand

237
00:19:30,310 --> 00:19:31,151
such extreme cold.

238
00:19:31,270 --> 00:19:31,871
To save you,

239
00:19:32,030 --> 00:19:33,591
he didn't hesitate
to be punished by Elder He,

240
00:19:33,631 --> 00:19:34,431
yet you won't even say

241
00:19:34,431 --> 00:19:35,351
a word for him?

242
00:19:35,351 --> 00:19:36,071
Yeah.

243
00:19:36,230 --> 00:19:36,911
And just now,

244
00:19:36,911 --> 00:19:38,391
we went to intercede with Elder He.

245
00:19:38,550 --> 00:19:39,391
But he said

246
00:19:39,911 --> 00:19:42,431
Xueying deserved the punishment.

247
00:19:42,591 --> 00:19:44,111
We tried hard, but it was in vain.

248
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:45,510
Xueying got punished

249
00:19:45,631 --> 00:19:46,270
because of you.

250
00:19:46,270 --> 00:19:47,111
Your plea

251
00:19:47,111 --> 00:19:48,230
will be more effective than ours.

252
00:19:48,550 --> 00:19:49,871
I need to rest now.

253
00:19:50,351 --> 00:19:51,510
You guys leave.

254
00:19:52,391 --> 00:19:53,391
Wu Cang,

255
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,191
you are really

256
00:19:54,191 --> 00:19:55,431
a heartless monster.

257
00:19:55,470 --> 00:19:57,151
Let's go. We'll find a way by ourselves.

258
00:19:57,310 --> 00:19:58,071
Let's go.

259
00:20:12,351 --> 00:20:14,030
(Is this how my mother)

260
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:16,470
(got through these past ten years?)

261
00:20:57,063 --> 00:21:00,216
(Qinyi Pavilion)

262
00:21:29,470 --> 00:21:31,470
Eat it. It expels the cold.

263
00:21:38,351 --> 00:21:40,351
What's this taste? It's so bitter.

264
00:21:40,550 --> 00:21:41,631
Hundred Insect Soup.

265
00:21:46,550 --> 00:21:47,510
Rest assured.

266
00:21:47,831 --> 00:21:48,631
These are just

267
00:21:48,631 --> 00:21:50,351
ordinary medicinally-valuable bugs.

268
00:21:50,710 --> 00:21:51,750
Not corpse bugs.

269
00:22:03,391 --> 00:22:05,030
How long have you been practicing
Esoteric Demise?

270
00:22:05,431 --> 00:22:06,750
20 years ago,

271
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:08,470
a big war occurred,

272
00:22:09,391 --> 00:22:10,191
and all my family

273
00:22:10,191 --> 00:22:11,990
died in that battle.

274
00:22:12,950 --> 00:22:14,431
Since then,

275
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:17,151
I've been practicing Esoteric Demise.

276
00:22:19,831 --> 00:22:21,191
So all those corpses
in the bamboo forest

277
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:22,831
were disciples who died

278
00:22:22,990 --> 00:22:23,710
because of practicing it.

279
00:22:24,071 --> 00:22:24,750
Yes.

280
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:27,470
Some died
because of the failure of practice.

281
00:22:28,270 --> 00:22:29,710
Some accidentally died

282
00:22:29,710 --> 00:22:30,950
when luring demons out.

283
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:32,591
Practicing the skill

284
00:22:32,710 --> 00:22:33,631
is inherently

285
00:22:33,671 --> 00:22:34,871
a very dangerous thing,

286
00:22:35,470 --> 00:22:36,191
as demons

287
00:22:36,191 --> 00:22:38,111
always hide in the dark,

288
00:22:38,351 --> 00:22:39,470
hard to be found.

289
00:22:40,431 --> 00:22:41,310
But

290
00:22:42,710 --> 00:22:43,911
this time I have already found

291
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,191
their approximate location.

292
00:22:46,310 --> 00:22:47,351
It's in Qu Tai City.

293
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:54,391
These years of practicing the skill

294
00:22:54,990 --> 00:22:56,310
left me alone

295
00:22:56,950 --> 00:22:58,030
with no friends

296
00:22:58,790 --> 00:23:00,671
and made my body age rapidly

297
00:23:01,030 --> 00:23:02,310
and my face ugly.

298
00:23:04,510 --> 00:23:05,510
Everyone who sees me

299
00:23:05,510 --> 00:23:06,990
avoids me from afar.

300
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:09,631
But that's fine.

301
00:23:10,710 --> 00:23:13,550
Alone I came into this world,
and alone I shall leave it.

302
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:15,871
Dying in battle

303
00:23:16,631 --> 00:23:18,151
is my only way out.

304
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:25,831
I can be your friend.

305
00:23:36,911 --> 00:23:37,790
I'm serious.

306
00:23:38,710 --> 00:23:39,950
I oppose

307
00:23:39,950 --> 00:23:41,111
the palace's behavior.

308
00:23:41,631 --> 00:23:42,790
Using disciples as bait

309
00:23:42,831 --> 00:23:44,071
to lure out demons.

310
00:23:44,790 --> 00:23:46,510
There must be a better way.

311
00:23:46,790 --> 00:23:47,671
One

312
00:23:48,391 --> 00:23:49,950
that doesn't hurt you.

313
00:23:59,831 --> 00:24:00,710
Well,

314
00:24:02,151 --> 00:24:04,071
I have to go to Master He,

315
00:24:04,671 --> 00:24:05,750
because his message box

316
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:06,470
is with me.

317
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:08,950
Message box?

318
00:24:10,270 --> 00:24:11,030
Wu Cang,

319
00:24:11,310 --> 00:24:12,591
may I take a look at it?

320
00:24:21,470 --> 00:24:22,230
You saw it

321
00:24:22,230 --> 00:24:23,310
in the public kitchen last time.

322
00:24:24,191 --> 00:24:26,030
It's used by the Elders
to communicate with each other.

323
00:24:26,750 --> 00:24:28,631
It's given to me temporarily

324
00:24:28,911 --> 00:24:30,470
because I had to lure the demons out.

325
00:24:31,671 --> 00:24:32,710
So

326
00:24:32,950 --> 00:24:34,671
only the Elders have such things?

327
00:24:35,831 --> 00:24:36,431
Yes.

328
00:24:36,710 --> 00:24:37,871
(If such things)

329
00:24:37,990 --> 00:24:39,510
(are only owned
by the six Elders,)

330
00:24:39,831 --> 00:24:40,790
(that means)

331
00:24:40,950 --> 00:24:41,790
(the man with the mask)

332
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:43,790
(might be one of them.)

333
00:24:44,351 --> 00:24:45,790
(If that's really the case,)

334
00:24:46,111 --> 00:24:47,270
(the whole plan)

335
00:24:47,391 --> 00:24:48,030
(against the Demon Clan)

336
00:24:48,111 --> 00:24:49,391
(may have already been
well known to them.)

337
00:24:49,750 --> 00:24:50,351
(I must)

338
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,270
(find this mole as soon as possible.)

339
00:24:51,831 --> 00:24:52,510
Wu Cang,

340
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,671
if you trust me,

341
00:24:55,030 --> 00:24:56,510
I'd like to ask you for a favor.

342
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:42,990
Dongbo Xueying,

343
00:25:44,270 --> 00:25:46,071
why are you sitting in my spot?

344
00:25:46,310 --> 00:25:48,750
This morning class is about cultivating
Dou Qi and spiritual power.

345
00:25:49,790 --> 00:25:51,510
Everyone always sits on the ground

346
00:25:51,550 --> 00:25:52,871
with no fixed seats.

347
00:25:53,111 --> 00:25:55,030
I practice Esoteric Demise,

348
00:25:55,270 --> 00:25:56,431
and it strongly requires

349
00:25:56,510 --> 00:25:57,550
avoiding disturbances.

350
00:25:58,151 --> 00:25:59,191
So every morning class,

351
00:25:59,310 --> 00:26:00,950
I sit in a corner.

352
00:26:01,431 --> 00:26:02,151
You are now sitting

353
00:26:02,270 --> 00:26:03,550
right where I usually sit.

354
00:26:04,030 --> 00:26:05,550
Everyone here knows that.

355
00:26:06,151 --> 00:26:08,151
They know, but it doesn't mean I do.

356
00:26:10,950 --> 00:26:12,030
Fine, I won't sit here.

357
00:26:12,191 --> 00:26:13,391
Dongbo Xueying,

358
00:26:14,191 --> 00:26:15,351
do you think

359
00:26:15,351 --> 00:26:16,270
you have exceptional talent

360
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:17,351
and, therefore, you can be so arrogant

361
00:26:17,351 --> 00:26:18,391
and always try to outdo others?

362
00:26:18,710 --> 00:26:20,750
If it hadn't been
for your heroic behavior that day,

363
00:26:21,111 --> 00:26:22,510
maybe we would have already found

364
00:26:22,510 --> 00:26:23,911
the location
of the Demon God Association.

365
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:28,310
That was what you got
for your pathetic strength.

366
00:26:28,470 --> 00:26:29,351
It was not my fault.

367
00:26:29,510 --> 00:26:30,391
Alright,

368
00:26:30,871 --> 00:26:32,550
let's have a fight then.

369
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:33,470
Come on.

370
00:26:34,470 --> 00:26:35,391
Senior,

371
00:26:35,671 --> 00:26:37,230
just a single seat.

372
00:26:37,391 --> 00:26:39,391
What's the big deal
about giving it to him?

373
00:26:39,710 --> 00:26:41,151
This is none of your business.

374
00:26:41,310 --> 00:26:42,871
Well, I'm making it my business.

375
00:26:43,470 --> 00:26:44,270
Xueying,

376
00:26:45,071 --> 00:26:46,591
if I help you win him,

377
00:26:46,990 --> 00:26:48,351
will you give me

378
00:26:48,510 --> 00:26:49,631
your cherished pendant?

379
00:26:50,071 --> 00:26:51,550
Why all the talk?

380
00:26:51,671 --> 00:26:52,671
Just take action.

381
00:26:52,790 --> 00:26:54,550
You two, hurry up.

382
00:26:55,151 --> 00:26:56,710
Yeah, just fight.

383
00:26:56,871 --> 00:26:57,750
Alright.

384
00:27:51,310 --> 00:27:52,631
(Why is it Master Gong?)

385
00:27:52,790 --> 00:27:54,470
(It seems our plan failed.)

386
00:27:54,591 --> 00:27:56,111
(We just wanted to cause a commotion
to get all the Elders to come over)

387
00:27:56,191 --> 00:27:57,470
(and take the chance to observe)

388
00:27:57,470 --> 00:27:58,391
(whose message box was lost.)

389
00:27:58,510 --> 00:28:00,030
(But we ended up
attracting Master Gong.)

390
00:28:00,151 --> 00:28:02,431
Your spear just rushed out

391
00:28:02,591 --> 00:28:03,550
like the wind,

392
00:28:03,710 --> 00:28:05,230
with its trajectory elusive.

393
00:28:05,391 --> 00:28:06,591
What skill were you using?

394
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,230
Esoteric Gust.

395
00:28:08,550 --> 00:28:09,270
Last time

396
00:28:09,431 --> 00:28:10,310
you were practicing it,

397
00:28:10,310 --> 00:28:11,391
I told you

398
00:28:11,550 --> 00:28:13,071
if you'd decided to focus
on Esoteric Water and Fire,

399
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,431
just concentrate on it

400
00:28:14,591 --> 00:28:16,710
and put aside
practicing Esoteric Gust for now.

401
00:28:16,831 --> 00:28:18,510
Did I say that to you?

402
00:28:18,710 --> 00:28:19,550
Yes, you did.

403
00:28:19,990 --> 00:28:21,950
In the path of cultivation,
one must prevent distracting themselves.

404
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:22,831
After all,

405
00:28:22,950 --> 00:28:24,710
a Transcendent cultivator's energy
is limited.

406
00:28:25,111 --> 00:28:27,310
You're still young,

407
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:29,351
and it's okay for you to divert
your attention to Esoteric Gust now.

408
00:28:29,950 --> 00:28:31,431
If you stop in time,

409
00:28:31,631 --> 00:28:33,550
you'll just waste a little time.

410
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,550
But you continue doing it.

411
00:28:35,710 --> 00:28:37,030
Do you know

412
00:28:37,230 --> 00:28:38,230
it will inevitably affect

413
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:39,631
your practice
of Esoteric Water and Fire?

414
00:28:39,790 --> 00:28:40,431
I know.

415
00:28:40,750 --> 00:28:42,230
But in my practice,

416
00:28:42,631 --> 00:28:43,591
I found

417
00:28:43,871 --> 00:28:45,510
Esoteric Water and Fire is not perfect.

418
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,310
Most of us

419
00:28:47,310 --> 00:28:48,550
only focus on training
without even considering it,

420
00:28:48,790 --> 00:28:50,631
hoping to elevate
the True Meaning techniques

421
00:28:50,750 --> 00:28:52,111
to a higher level.

422
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:53,431
But

423
00:28:53,631 --> 00:28:55,071
is it necessarily the right way?

424
00:28:56,071 --> 00:28:57,750
Whether mortal or Transcendent,

425
00:28:58,030 --> 00:28:59,950
all blindly practice the skills.

426
00:29:00,111 --> 00:29:01,391
Who has ever truly thought

427
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:02,750
about their own characteristics?

428
00:29:02,790 --> 00:29:03,750
Nonsense.

429
00:29:04,510 --> 00:29:05,950
Transcendent cultivators' path
of cultivation

430
00:29:06,071 --> 00:29:07,510
is always encumbered with trials.

431
00:29:07,790 --> 00:29:09,831
Having a few of the many disciples

432
00:29:09,990 --> 00:29:10,710
of our palace

433
00:29:10,710 --> 00:29:12,191
reach the peak of True Meaning

434
00:29:12,191 --> 00:29:13,230
is already praiseworthy.

435
00:29:13,790 --> 00:29:15,591
And you're even questioning
the True Meaning?

436
00:29:16,071 --> 00:29:17,111
You said you found

437
00:29:17,111 --> 00:29:18,510
the flaws in Esoteric Water and Fire.

438
00:29:18,750 --> 00:29:19,631
Then what?

439
00:29:20,071 --> 00:29:21,111
What can you do?

440
00:29:21,710 --> 00:29:23,871
I have successfully integrated

441
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,871
Esoteric Gust, Water and Fire
into my spear technique.

442
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,351
How dare you!

443
00:29:27,510 --> 00:29:28,911
Who let you do this?

444
00:29:29,191 --> 00:29:30,230
Don't you know

445
00:29:30,230 --> 00:29:31,270
the common sense of cultivation?

446
00:29:31,750 --> 00:29:32,391
I know.

447
00:29:34,030 --> 00:29:35,270
The path of cultivation

448
00:29:35,591 --> 00:29:37,710
becomes more and more difficult
as you progress.

449
00:29:38,191 --> 00:29:39,550
Those who can enter the Saint realm

450
00:29:39,710 --> 00:29:40,790
are few and far between.

451
00:29:41,071 --> 00:29:42,270
Those who can step
into the Demigod realm

452
00:29:42,270 --> 00:29:43,431
are even rarer.

453
00:29:43,631 --> 00:29:44,871
At such a young age,

454
00:29:45,030 --> 00:29:46,950
you have combined
Esoteric Water and Fire

455
00:29:47,111 --> 00:29:48,310
and even easily

456
00:29:48,310 --> 00:29:49,470
reached the second level.

457
00:29:49,790 --> 00:29:50,831
Continuing down this path,

458
00:29:51,071 --> 00:29:52,310
it's not impossible

459
00:29:52,550 --> 00:29:54,111
to enter the Saint realm.

460
00:29:54,431 --> 00:29:55,591
In your lifetime,

461
00:29:55,631 --> 00:29:56,710
there's still hope to step

462
00:29:56,710 --> 00:29:57,831
into the Demigod realm.

463
00:29:58,351 --> 00:29:59,710
You have a great future ahead,

464
00:30:00,030 --> 00:30:01,990
and our clan stands a good chance

465
00:30:01,990 --> 00:30:03,431
of having another Demigod.

466
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:05,831
We all have high hopes for you.

467
00:30:06,710 --> 00:30:07,871
But you...

468
00:30:08,510 --> 00:30:09,990
You're destroying your own future.

469
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:11,710
You actually want to

470
00:30:11,710 --> 00:30:12,591
integrate Esoteric Gust.

471
00:30:12,750 --> 00:30:14,151
How can you be sure this path

472
00:30:14,191 --> 00:30:15,631
isn't a dead end?

473
00:30:16,550 --> 00:30:17,871
Master Gong is right.

474
00:30:18,671 --> 00:30:20,391
Only by drawing
on a blank piece of paper

475
00:30:20,671 --> 00:30:22,111
can you create the best painting.

476
00:30:22,470 --> 00:30:23,270
But on a piece of paper

477
00:30:23,270 --> 00:30:24,550
covered with colors,

478
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:26,351
even making a single modification

479
00:30:26,351 --> 00:30:27,391
is very difficult.

480
00:30:27,510 --> 00:30:28,911
(This principle holds true
for cultivation too.)

481
00:30:29,270 --> 00:30:30,550
(As a genius,)

482
00:30:30,710 --> 00:30:31,270
(how could he make)

483
00:30:31,270 --> 00:30:32,470
(such a fatal mistake?)

484
00:30:32,631 --> 00:30:33,391
I doubt

485
00:30:34,030 --> 00:30:35,431
the path of cultivation set

486
00:30:35,431 --> 00:30:36,510
by the palace

487
00:30:36,510 --> 00:30:38,030
is not suitable
for all Transcendent cultivators.

488
00:30:38,790 --> 00:30:39,631
Master Gong,

489
00:30:40,270 --> 00:30:41,230
haven't you ever questioned

490
00:30:41,270 --> 00:30:42,671
it?

491
00:30:43,270 --> 00:30:44,950
Letting Senior Wu risk his life

492
00:30:45,071 --> 00:30:46,710
and even sacrifice his life
for the Xia Clan.

493
00:30:46,831 --> 00:30:47,750
Is this the right way?

494
00:30:48,591 --> 00:30:49,950
We,

495
00:30:50,230 --> 00:30:51,351
neither in strength

496
00:30:51,470 --> 00:30:52,391
nor in the speed of progress,

497
00:30:52,391 --> 00:30:53,310
are the same.

498
00:30:53,790 --> 00:30:55,391
But from mortal to Transcendent,

499
00:30:55,950 --> 00:30:57,310
who hasn't worked hard to practice

500
00:30:57,310 --> 00:30:58,191
or ever experienced a near-death state?

501
00:30:59,550 --> 00:31:01,710
But such hard-earned cultivators

502
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:04,191
are treated by the palace
as sacrificial pawns,

503
00:31:04,591 --> 00:31:06,510
with all future possibilities ruined.

504
00:31:06,831 --> 00:31:07,990
Is the life of a Transcendent cultivator

505
00:31:08,191 --> 00:31:09,950
so insignificant?

506
00:31:10,431 --> 00:31:11,790
This is for our clan

507
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:13,191
and our empire.

508
00:31:13,351 --> 00:31:14,470
Even if it's a sacrifice,

509
00:31:14,871 --> 00:31:17,111
it's glorious and great.

510
00:31:17,270 --> 00:31:18,990
I don't believe there's only one way.

511
00:31:19,151 --> 00:31:20,431
Just like I don't believe

512
00:31:20,671 --> 00:31:22,151
that only the Xinhuo Palace

513
00:31:22,391 --> 00:31:23,351
can set a path of cultivation

514
00:31:23,351 --> 00:31:24,790
for Transcendent cultivators.

515
00:31:27,111 --> 00:31:27,990
Fine,

516
00:31:28,591 --> 00:31:30,071
today I'll let you know

517
00:31:30,750 --> 00:31:32,030
what your stubbornness

518
00:31:32,071 --> 00:31:33,431
will bring you.

519
00:31:34,071 --> 00:31:35,911
Use all your crooked skills.

520
00:31:36,151 --> 00:31:37,391
Let me see what you've got.

521
00:31:42,550 --> 00:31:43,391
(That's great.)

522
00:31:43,871 --> 00:31:45,191
(It's such a good opportunity)

523
00:31:45,431 --> 00:31:46,431
(to duel with a Demigod.)

524
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:51,750
(How fast.)

525
00:32:38,270 --> 00:32:39,510
Confronted with the bone-piercing cold,

526
00:32:39,710 --> 00:32:41,470
Xueying must use body-protecting Dou Qi
to maintain body temperature.

527
00:32:41,671 --> 00:32:43,431
Otherwise,

528
00:32:43,591 --> 00:32:45,071
it would be hard to hold on.

529
00:33:20,519 --> 00:33:22,912
(True Meaning of Pole Point)

530
00:33:44,831 --> 00:33:45,470
Master Gong,

531
00:33:46,030 --> 00:33:47,151
please forgive my offense.

532
00:33:47,871 --> 00:33:49,310
A second-grade True Meaning.

533
00:33:52,191 --> 00:33:53,230
With such a huge gap in strength

534
00:33:53,230 --> 00:33:54,230
between the two sides,

535
00:33:54,431 --> 00:33:55,470
he could still win.

536
00:33:56,671 --> 00:33:58,631
The second-grade True Meaning
can qualify as the most incredible

537
00:33:58,631 --> 00:33:59,950
of all that has been invented
by the Xia Clan since ancient times.

538
00:34:00,391 --> 00:34:01,710
It's so powerful.

539
00:34:01,871 --> 00:34:04,030
Good thing that Dongbo Xueying insisted

540
00:34:04,230 --> 00:34:05,710
on practicing various skills
at the same time.

541
00:34:05,871 --> 00:34:08,151
If he only mastered
the True Meanings of Water and Fire,

542
00:34:08,310 --> 00:34:09,591
then even if he became a Demigod,

543
00:34:09,790 --> 00:34:10,430
he would at most

544
00:34:10,511 --> 00:34:11,870
reach the level

545
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:12,710
of Master Sikong Yang.

546
00:34:12,790 --> 00:34:13,870
For our clan,

547
00:34:13,951 --> 00:34:15,151
that's just icing on the cake.

548
00:34:15,350 --> 00:34:16,511
Because there are many

549
00:34:16,511 --> 00:34:17,591
of that level.

550
00:34:17,750 --> 00:34:18,750
But if there's really a Demigod

551
00:34:18,750 --> 00:34:20,390
with second-grade True Meaning,

552
00:34:20,631 --> 00:34:21,870
it will be different.

553
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:23,511
He may dominate

554
00:34:23,511 --> 00:34:24,270
an era.

555
00:34:24,551 --> 00:34:25,191
By the way,

556
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:27,151
what's the name
of this second-grade True Meaning?

557
00:34:32,151 --> 00:34:33,350
True Meaning of Pole Point.

558
00:34:45,750 --> 00:34:46,710
You're right.

559
00:34:47,151 --> 00:34:47,870
Xueying,

560
00:34:48,551 --> 00:34:49,991
the path for Transcendent cultivators

561
00:34:50,151 --> 00:34:51,390
has more than one.

562
00:34:51,991 --> 00:34:53,870
Walking a road
that predecessors have not tried

563
00:34:54,031 --> 00:34:55,310
is not necessarily a bad thing.

564
00:34:57,350 --> 00:34:58,551
I admit

565
00:34:59,390 --> 00:35:00,511
I lost.

566
00:35:07,790 --> 00:35:09,710
I never thought there would be a day

567
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:11,111
when Master Gong

568
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:11,951
would admit defeat to a disciple.

569
00:35:13,151 --> 00:35:14,551
This is too shocking for me.

570
00:35:14,951 --> 00:35:16,710
It's because Master Gong's disciple

571
00:35:16,710 --> 00:35:17,830
is Xueying.

572
00:35:18,031 --> 00:35:19,471
If it were you,

573
00:35:19,631 --> 00:35:21,471
you would get feet of jelly.

574
00:35:22,631 --> 00:35:23,830
(I finally broke through.)

575
00:35:24,390 --> 00:35:25,430
(It proves that I was right to stick)

576
00:35:25,430 --> 00:35:26,830
(to my own path of cultivation.)

577
00:35:27,310 --> 00:35:28,830
(Although this time
I've broken through,)

578
00:35:29,430 --> 00:35:31,071
(the spy is still not found.)

579
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:32,591
(I must find another opportunity)

580
00:35:32,951 --> 00:35:34,031
(to investigate further.)

581
00:35:41,026 --> 00:35:42,136
(Changfeng Academy)

582
00:35:46,750 --> 00:35:47,430
Master.

583
00:35:48,430 --> 00:35:50,270
Jingqiu, what are you here for?

584
00:35:50,390 --> 00:35:51,270
Master,

585
00:35:51,471 --> 00:35:52,991
I'm here to say goodbye to you.

586
00:35:55,511 --> 00:35:56,830
Now the Demon Clan runs rampant.

587
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,031
Our clan needs

588
00:35:58,031 --> 00:35:59,390
the power to fight against them.

589
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,151
You've been studying at the academy

590
00:36:01,151 --> 00:36:02,310
for some time.

591
00:36:02,631 --> 00:36:04,151
I wanted you to improve quickly,

592
00:36:04,230 --> 00:36:05,270
so I made an exception

593
00:36:05,511 --> 00:36:07,151
by letting you join
a Transcendent organization

594
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:08,230
without having to take

595
00:36:08,230 --> 00:36:09,390
the Transcendent Exam.

596
00:36:10,111 --> 00:36:10,830
Jingqiu,

597
00:36:12,310 --> 00:36:12,870
do you plan

598
00:36:12,870 --> 00:36:14,111
to return to the Water Daoist Temple?

599
00:36:14,230 --> 00:36:15,671
I'm going to
the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

600
00:36:16,631 --> 00:36:17,631
Dragon Mountain Mansion?

601
00:36:18,631 --> 00:36:20,471
During the battle
of the Xueying Territory,

602
00:36:20,631 --> 00:36:21,671
I think I saw

603
00:36:21,671 --> 00:36:22,750
the images of my parents again.

604
00:36:23,031 --> 00:36:24,830
I still can't put aside my identity.

605
00:36:25,071 --> 00:36:26,151
I want to join
the Dragon Mountain Mansion

606
00:36:26,151 --> 00:36:27,310
to find them.

607
00:36:27,471 --> 00:36:28,270
Moreover,

608
00:36:28,471 --> 00:36:29,671
the Demon Clan
took away the bronze coffin,

609
00:36:29,671 --> 00:36:30,511
and their whereabouts are unknown.

610
00:36:30,551 --> 00:36:31,591
The Demon God Association

611
00:36:31,631 --> 00:36:33,350
has also been hiding in the dark.

612
00:36:33,750 --> 00:36:35,031
If I join the Dragon Mountain Mansion,

613
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:36,511
I might be able to help us

614
00:36:36,511 --> 00:36:37,790
find the location
of the Demon God Association.

615
00:36:38,230 --> 00:36:38,910
That's fine.

616
00:36:40,591 --> 00:36:41,631
What about you two?

617
00:36:42,230 --> 00:36:44,191
I want to have
a strong person as my master.

618
00:36:44,390 --> 00:36:45,111
In the beginning,

619
00:36:45,111 --> 00:36:46,270
I came to Changfeng Academy

620
00:36:46,270 --> 00:36:47,471
because of Xueying.

621
00:36:47,870 --> 00:36:48,591
Now,

622
00:36:48,671 --> 00:36:50,350
I just want to keep practicing
and become stronger.

623
00:36:50,750 --> 00:36:53,031
I want to avenge my father and brother.

624
00:36:53,551 --> 00:36:55,230
I'm very sad

625
00:36:55,390 --> 00:36:56,551
about what happened to them, too.

626
00:36:57,551 --> 00:36:58,111
I firmly believe we will

627
00:36:58,111 --> 00:36:59,390
avenge them.

628
00:37:00,191 --> 00:37:00,951
Master,

629
00:37:01,111 --> 00:37:01,790
I want to join

630
00:37:01,790 --> 00:37:02,991
your organization, too.

631
00:37:03,790 --> 00:37:05,031
I'm not picky.

632
00:37:05,191 --> 00:37:06,790
Whichever Demigod
Youyue has as a master,

633
00:37:06,830 --> 00:37:08,191
that'll be

634
00:37:08,191 --> 00:37:08,750
my master too.

635
00:37:09,591 --> 00:37:10,551
You're in excellent physical condition.

636
00:37:10,790 --> 00:37:11,750
If you can find

637
00:37:11,750 --> 00:37:13,430
a more suitable master,

638
00:37:13,951 --> 00:37:15,471
you might achieve greater results.

639
00:37:16,790 --> 00:37:17,710
I recommend Master He

640
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,750
of the Black White Deity Mountain.

641
00:37:20,111 --> 00:37:21,310
He has his own set of methods

642
00:37:21,430 --> 00:37:23,031
in cultivation.

643
00:37:23,350 --> 00:37:24,631
You can consider
asking him to be your master.

644
00:37:24,830 --> 00:37:25,430
Okay.

645
00:37:28,511 --> 00:37:29,350
Master,

646
00:37:29,591 --> 00:37:30,910
three mages

647
00:37:31,270 --> 00:37:32,870
want to join us.

648
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:34,790
As per the old rules,

649
00:37:34,790 --> 00:37:36,390
we held a competition

650
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:37,790
and picked out the best one.

651
00:37:37,991 --> 00:37:39,511
The other two who didn't make it

652
00:37:39,551 --> 00:37:41,591
chose the Sea God Palace
and the Fog City instead.

653
00:37:42,111 --> 00:37:42,991
Besides,

654
00:37:43,191 --> 00:37:44,471
there are two disciples

655
00:37:44,631 --> 00:37:46,111
from Changfeng Academy.

656
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,710
One is a mage,

657
00:37:47,870 --> 00:37:49,750
and the other is a knight.

658
00:37:51,310 --> 00:37:52,830
I've always disagreed

659
00:37:52,830 --> 00:37:54,430
with that academy's training methods.

660
00:37:55,710 --> 00:37:56,671
Under the guidance

661
00:37:56,671 --> 00:37:58,151
of the teachers there, their disciples

662
00:37:58,390 --> 00:37:59,830
find it easy to practice
in the early stages

663
00:38:00,031 --> 00:38:01,390
and make improvements constantly.

664
00:38:01,790 --> 00:38:03,111
But when they want

665
00:38:03,111 --> 00:38:04,631
to find their own way

666
00:38:04,870 --> 00:38:06,350
without the guidance of their teachers,

667
00:38:06,591 --> 00:38:07,551
many people

668
00:38:07,631 --> 00:38:09,390
don't know how to continue.

669
00:38:10,430 --> 00:38:11,551
Who would have thought

670
00:38:11,870 --> 00:38:13,230
that in Changfeng Academy,

671
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:14,991
a peerless genius called Dongbo Xueying

672
00:38:14,991 --> 00:38:15,951
would emerge?

673
00:38:16,071 --> 00:38:17,511
Even now, I still regret

674
00:38:17,511 --> 00:38:18,350
not recruiting him

675
00:38:18,350 --> 00:38:19,471
to our sect.

676
00:38:21,151 --> 00:38:23,511
Perhaps, he...

677
00:38:23,671 --> 00:38:25,031
The knight who enrolled this time

678
00:38:25,111 --> 00:38:26,710
is said to be a classmate

679
00:38:26,710 --> 00:38:27,951
and good friend of his.

680
00:38:28,151 --> 00:38:30,310
It's also said
that he and Dongbo Xueying

681
00:38:30,310 --> 00:38:32,870
have braved death together,

682
00:38:33,031 --> 00:38:35,111
and their relationship is extraordinary.

683
00:38:35,671 --> 00:38:37,111
Then there's no need
for further discussion.

684
00:38:37,310 --> 00:38:38,191
No need for him to take an exam.

685
00:38:38,191 --> 00:38:39,910
Besides the advertised benefits,
give him an extra 30 percent.

686
00:38:40,111 --> 00:38:41,350
Like seeks like.

687
00:38:41,551 --> 00:38:42,631
A friend

688
00:38:42,631 --> 00:38:43,750
of Dongbo Xueying

689
00:38:43,750 --> 00:38:44,830
can't be far behind him.

690
00:38:45,591 --> 00:38:47,471
I don't think there's any chance

691
00:38:47,471 --> 00:38:48,710
of a fool or a slob
getting his attention.

692
00:38:49,951 --> 00:38:51,071
What's his name?

693
00:38:51,430 --> 00:38:53,191
His name is Puyang Bo.

694
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:54,750
Alright, it's him then.

695
00:38:55,551 --> 00:38:57,270
I don't expect him to be as talented

696
00:38:57,270 --> 00:38:58,310
as Dongbo Xueying.

697
00:38:58,830 --> 00:39:00,191
After all, a prodigy like him

698
00:39:00,270 --> 00:39:02,151
who can master the True Meaning
of Water and Fire at a young age

699
00:39:02,310 --> 00:39:03,151
only pops up

700
00:39:03,191 --> 00:39:04,551
once in a blue moon.

701
00:39:05,111 --> 00:39:06,471
Even if he's 70 percent as good as him,

702
00:39:07,471 --> 00:39:08,631
I'd be elated.

703
00:39:09,350 --> 00:39:12,071
Alright, I'll go and arrange it now.

704
00:39:14,111 --> 00:39:15,471
Puyang Bo, come in.

705
00:39:16,390 --> 00:39:17,071
I'm here.

706
00:39:20,710 --> 00:39:22,430
You come with me.

707
00:39:22,591 --> 00:39:23,111
Me?

708
00:39:23,551 --> 00:39:25,071
Am I admitted?

709
00:39:27,151 --> 00:39:27,671
Go.

710
00:39:30,310 --> 00:39:32,310
Only you.

711
00:39:35,031 --> 00:39:36,790
Only me?

712
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:37,830
I won't.

713
00:39:37,830 --> 00:39:39,191
I won't go without Youyue.

714
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:41,631
That's not up to you.

715
00:39:43,031 --> 00:39:43,511
No.

716
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:45,591
Wait, wait.

717
00:39:45,591 --> 00:39:46,671
Calm down, calm down.

718
00:39:47,390 --> 00:39:47,991
Puyang Bo.

719
00:39:48,191 --> 00:39:49,191
Youyue,

720
00:39:49,310 --> 00:39:50,111
Youyue, don't worry.

721
00:39:50,111 --> 00:39:50,551
Puyang Bo.

722
00:39:50,551 --> 00:39:51,191
I will definitely come out alive

723
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,270
to see you.

724
00:39:56,830 --> 00:39:57,551
Rong.

725
00:40:04,671 --> 00:40:06,430
Rong, what's wrong?

726
00:40:08,310 --> 00:40:10,071
I had a dream last night.

727
00:40:10,750 --> 00:40:12,830
I dreamed
Uncle Zong Ling had an accident.

728
00:40:13,390 --> 00:40:15,270
I was very sad
when I woke up this morning.

729
00:40:16,071 --> 00:40:18,031
Silly girl, how could that happen?

730
00:40:18,430 --> 00:40:19,430
Now, the Demon Clan

731
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,031
has been driven out of the territory.

732
00:40:21,191 --> 00:40:22,870
So Uncle Zong Ling and the territory

733
00:40:23,031 --> 00:40:24,071
are safe.

734
00:40:24,270 --> 00:40:25,830
Our top priority now

735
00:40:25,870 --> 00:40:27,430
is to find
the Demon God Association quickly.

736
00:40:27,790 --> 00:40:30,031
We must catch
all the demons in one move.

737
00:40:31,191 --> 00:40:32,631
I don't know why.

738
00:40:32,631 --> 00:40:33,951
But I'm very anxious.

739
00:40:34,991 --> 00:40:36,270
How about going back to the territory

740
00:40:36,270 --> 00:40:37,031
to check it out?

741
00:40:37,991 --> 00:40:39,191
Going back?

742
00:40:39,310 --> 00:40:40,151
Yes.

743
00:40:40,511 --> 00:40:42,551
We came back to this mansion in a hurry

744
00:40:42,750 --> 00:40:44,671
because our master was injured.

745
00:40:45,111 --> 00:40:46,830
I've spent some time

746
00:40:46,830 --> 00:40:48,430
with Uncle Tong San and Uncle Zong Ling,

747
00:40:48,750 --> 00:40:50,551
and I really miss them.

748
00:40:50,991 --> 00:40:51,710
Rong,

749
00:40:52,350 --> 00:40:53,511
I never thought

750
00:40:53,710 --> 00:40:54,631
that you would

751
00:40:54,631 --> 00:40:55,591
think so much by yourself.

752
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,671
People have feelings.

753
00:40:58,671 --> 00:41:00,951
I feel very sad
about Uncle Tong San's death,

754
00:41:01,991 --> 00:41:04,071
so I worry something might happen
to Uncle Zong Ling.

755
00:41:04,750 --> 00:41:05,631
Anyway, the Xueying Territory

756
00:41:05,631 --> 00:41:06,830
isn't far from the mansion.

757
00:41:07,270 --> 00:41:09,350
Let's go back and have a look.

758
00:41:15,750 --> 00:41:17,750
Alright, let's do as you say.

759
00:41:18,111 --> 00:41:19,350
We'll go see him together.

760
00:41:26,631 --> 00:41:27,471
Stop.

761
00:41:31,270 --> 00:41:32,710
Where are you going?

762
00:41:36,270 --> 00:41:36,951
Master,

763
00:41:37,191 --> 00:41:38,031
Ji Rong and I

764
00:41:38,031 --> 00:41:39,151
are worried about Uncle Zong Ling

765
00:41:39,151 --> 00:41:40,390
and the people of the Xueying Territory.

766
00:41:40,591 --> 00:41:41,790
We want to go back and take a look.

767
00:41:41,991 --> 00:41:42,910
You're not allowed to.

768
00:41:43,310 --> 00:41:44,430
Why, Master?

769
00:41:44,430 --> 00:41:46,270
I said you can't go.

770
00:41:46,830 --> 00:41:48,111
It's only been a few days
since you came back,

771
00:41:48,111 --> 00:41:49,270
and you're already thinking
about leaving.

772
00:41:49,591 --> 00:41:50,710
Are you not going to practice anymore?

773
00:41:50,951 --> 00:41:52,111
Do you have no sense of rules?

774
00:41:54,430 --> 00:41:55,631
Forget it.

775
00:41:55,870 --> 00:41:57,270
Perhaps Master's injury

776
00:41:57,270 --> 00:41:58,230
hasn't healed yet.

777
00:41:58,270 --> 00:41:59,631
We'll talk about it in a few days.

778
00:42:01,071 --> 00:42:01,710
Let's go.

779
00:42:14,350 --> 00:42:16,350
- Kill her.
- You monster!

780
00:42:16,390 --> 00:42:17,511
Kill her!

781
00:42:17,591 --> 00:42:19,430
You monster!

782
00:42:19,710 --> 00:42:20,830
- Kill her.
- You monster!

783
00:42:20,910 --> 00:42:22,230
Go to die, you monster!

784
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:24,230
- Monster!
- Monster!

785
00:42:24,230 --> 00:42:25,830
- Beat the monster!
- Monster!

786
00:42:25,830 --> 00:42:26,430
Stop!

787
00:42:26,471 --> 00:42:28,310
- Go to die.
- Go to die.

788
00:42:28,310 --> 00:42:28,991
Don't hit her anymore!

789
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:30,151
You monster!

790
00:42:31,071 --> 00:42:32,511
- Run.
- Run.

791
00:42:33,390 --> 00:42:34,191
Wait for me!

792
00:42:38,591 --> 00:42:39,471
Get up.

793
00:42:40,071 --> 00:42:40,750
It's okay now.

794
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:48,710
Poor child.

795
00:42:49,790 --> 00:42:50,551
Get up.

796
00:42:54,591 --> 00:42:55,191
(Rong,)

797
00:42:55,390 --> 00:42:56,870
(I didn't save you back then)

798
00:42:57,031 --> 00:42:57,951
(only for you to walk)

799
00:42:57,951 --> 00:42:59,471
(this path today.)

800
00:42:59,671 --> 00:43:01,591
(As the saying goes, to not teach
is the fault of the father.)

801
00:43:01,671 --> 00:43:03,031
(I treat you like a daughter.)

802
00:43:03,191 --> 00:43:04,430
(I won't let you)

803
00:43:04,430 --> 00:43:05,991
(going down the wrong path.)

804
00:43:30,390 --> 00:43:31,870
This demonic technique

805
00:43:32,031 --> 00:43:33,591
is indeed worthy of its reputation.

806
00:43:35,951 --> 00:43:37,591
The day when I defeat Dongbo Xueying

807
00:43:38,471 --> 00:43:39,830
is just around the corner.

808
00:43:50,671 --> 00:43:51,631
How do you feel?

809
00:43:52,191 --> 00:43:54,071
Are you satisfied with the power

810
00:43:54,310 --> 00:43:55,591
of the demonic technique?

811
00:43:55,830 --> 00:43:56,951
Very much so.

812
00:43:57,870 --> 00:43:58,790
I feel like

813
00:43:58,790 --> 00:43:59,991
I'm full of energy now.

814
00:44:00,551 --> 00:44:01,830
I can definitely defeat

815
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:02,750
Dongbo Xueying.

816
00:44:04,430 --> 00:44:05,310
Now there is

817
00:44:05,310 --> 00:44:06,591
another task for you.

818
00:44:07,350 --> 00:44:08,310
What task?

819
00:44:09,750 --> 00:44:11,511
Break through the Hundred-Battle Chamber

820
00:44:11,671 --> 00:44:13,471
and enter the Xinhuo Palace.

00:44:44,865 --> 00:44:50,590
