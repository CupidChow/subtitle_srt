21
00:01:47,962 --> 00:01:49,721
This is Dongbo Xueying's idea?

22
00:01:49,842 --> 00:01:50,561
Yes.

23
00:01:50,682 --> 00:01:52,001
I think it's a solution.

24
00:01:53,441 --> 00:01:55,122
That's indeed worth a try.

25
00:01:56,081 --> 00:01:57,242
Dongbo Xueying

26
00:01:57,322 --> 00:01:58,242
is smart

27
00:01:58,322 --> 00:01:59,242
and has great potential.

28
00:01:59,322 --> 00:02:00,441
Once he enters our academy,

29
00:02:00,561 --> 00:02:01,161
let him stay by your side

30
00:02:01,242 --> 00:02:02,161
and cultivate him well.

31
00:02:02,561 --> 00:02:03,482
In the future,

32
00:02:03,561 --> 00:02:05,122
he will be a talent

33
00:02:05,202 --> 00:02:06,521
for Dragon Mountain Empire.

34
00:02:20,002 --> 00:02:21,202
Today, when Xueying said
he was gonna find the mole,

35
00:02:21,282 --> 00:02:22,681
I thought it was just a bluff.

36
00:02:22,841 --> 00:02:24,081
I didn't expect him

37
00:02:24,202 --> 00:02:25,322
to really find the mole.

38
00:02:25,322 --> 00:02:26,241
Neither did I.

39
00:02:26,282 --> 00:02:27,081
I really didn't expect

40
00:02:27,081 --> 00:02:27,921
that Senior Xiuran

41
00:02:27,921 --> 00:02:29,361
was a spy sent by the Demon Clan.

42
00:02:29,482 --> 00:02:30,042
I heard

43
00:02:30,121 --> 00:02:31,322
he was bound by some Deadly Vow.

44
00:02:31,442 --> 00:02:32,361
Whether he tells the truth or not,

45
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:33,482
he's gonna die.

46
00:02:33,562 --> 00:02:35,521
And in the end,
he might only commit suicide.

47
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:36,921
In addition

48
00:02:37,002 --> 00:02:38,002
to stealing the Ocean Realm Stone

49
00:02:38,002 --> 00:02:38,961
at the beginning,

50
00:02:39,002 --> 00:02:39,681
he must have done a lot

51
00:02:39,762 --> 00:02:40,681
for the Demon Clan by now.

52
00:02:41,562 --> 00:02:42,401
Now, it's good.

53
00:02:42,521 --> 00:02:44,322
The mole sent by the Demon Clan
is completely uprooted.

54
00:02:44,482 --> 00:02:45,282
And they

55
00:02:45,361 --> 00:02:46,681
haven't known it to this moment.

56
00:02:47,482 --> 00:02:48,482
Without this mole,

57
00:02:48,562 --> 00:02:49,562
I feel much more relieved.

58
00:02:49,722 --> 00:02:50,762
Once I let my guard down,

59
00:02:51,361 --> 00:02:52,241
it's easy to get sleepy.

60
00:02:52,282 --> 00:02:53,401
I really want to go back
and sleep for a while.

61
00:02:53,521 --> 00:02:54,361
Then you go back.

62
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:55,482
It's fine with me guarding here.

63
00:02:55,562 --> 00:02:56,882
Well, can you do it?

64
00:02:57,002 --> 00:02:59,121
Your injury from practicing last time
hasn't healed yet.

65
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:00,602
What are you afraid of?

66
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,482
This place

67
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:02,762
is the Prison for Mortals of our temple.

68
00:03:02,841 --> 00:03:04,042
It can imprison any people

69
00:03:04,042 --> 00:03:04,961
below the transcendent realm.

70
00:03:05,801 --> 00:03:06,602
Go back quickly.

71
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:08,121
Just come to switch with me
in the second half of the night.

72
00:03:08,241 --> 00:03:09,202
Then I'll go back and take a nap.

73
00:03:09,322 --> 00:03:10,202
Be careful on your own.

74
00:03:10,202 --> 00:03:10,882
Hurry up.

75
00:03:10,882 --> 00:03:11,521
I'm leaving.

76
00:03:39,361 --> 00:03:41,322
(Is Mr. Xiang coming to save me?)

77
00:03:58,282 --> 00:03:59,202
Ge Bin escaped.

78
00:03:59,202 --> 00:03:59,921
Chase him quickly.

79
00:04:02,042 --> 00:04:02,762
Hurry up.

80
00:04:07,282 --> 00:04:08,681
You're from the Demon God Association?

81
00:04:09,722 --> 00:04:10,681
Thank you for the rescue.

82
00:04:14,961 --> 00:04:16,042
After this commotion,

83
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:16,961
Ge Bin will definitely know

84
00:04:16,961 --> 00:04:18,041
(Auspicious Clouds Room)
the demon spy hidden

85
00:04:18,041 --> 00:04:19,202
(Auspicious Clouds Room)
in the Water Daoist Temple is dead.

86
00:04:19,481 --> 00:04:20,161
This matter

87
00:04:20,281 --> 00:04:21,242
is of great importance to him.

88
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:21,961
So he will try

89
00:04:22,081 --> 00:04:23,202
every possible way

90
00:04:23,281 --> 00:04:24,161
to contact the Demon Clan

91
00:04:24,281 --> 00:04:25,322
to make up for his mistake.

92
00:04:25,601 --> 00:04:26,081
At this time,

93
00:04:26,081 --> 00:04:27,041
as long as we follow him

94
00:04:27,122 --> 00:04:28,401
and catch the person he contacts,

95
00:04:28,562 --> 00:04:30,081
we'll get more clues for investigation.

96
00:04:30,442 --> 00:04:31,442
Releasing Ge Bin?

97
00:04:31,601 --> 00:04:32,481
Not really releasing him.

98
00:04:32,601 --> 00:04:33,362
Don't worry.

99
00:04:33,601 --> 00:04:34,802
Ge Bin is cunning

100
00:04:34,802 --> 00:04:35,682
and knows evil techniques of Demon Clan.

101
00:04:35,762 --> 00:04:37,442
You're releasing
a very dangerous beast.

102
00:04:37,562 --> 00:04:38,802
I think what Xueying said

103
00:04:38,802 --> 00:04:39,922
is a good solution.

104
00:04:40,481 --> 00:04:42,122
Releasing Ge Bin is just a smokescreen.

105
00:04:42,202 --> 00:04:43,281
If we catch the people

106
00:04:43,401 --> 00:04:44,641
from Demon God Association through him,

107
00:04:44,841 --> 00:04:46,081
it would also be a merit

108
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,122
for the Water Daoist Temple.

109
00:04:47,521 --> 00:04:48,562
The Demon Clan

110
00:04:48,562 --> 00:04:49,362
has already taken action.

111
00:04:49,562 --> 00:04:49,961
We need

112
00:04:50,041 --> 00:04:51,161
to figure it out as soon as possible.

113
00:04:59,512 --> 00:05:03,416
(Wind & Bamboo Pavilion)

114
00:05:16,401 --> 00:05:17,521
Eat something.

115
00:05:19,401 --> 00:05:20,081
No,

116
00:05:20,762 --> 00:05:21,481
thanks.

117
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:23,202
I know you're kneeling,

118
00:05:23,202 --> 00:05:23,961
but you still need to eat something.

119
00:05:24,081 --> 00:05:24,762
Do you really want

120
00:05:24,762 --> 00:05:25,762
to faint from hunger here?

121
00:05:25,922 --> 00:05:26,882
Since I said I would kneel

122
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:28,882
until Master accepts me as a disciple,

123
00:05:29,401 --> 00:05:30,882
I must keep my word.

124
00:05:31,002 --> 00:05:32,161
Why are you so stubborn?

125
00:05:32,281 --> 00:05:33,601
Master is

126
00:05:33,721 --> 00:05:34,682
very stubborn.

127
00:05:34,802 --> 00:05:35,721
When there's a chance,

128
00:05:35,882 --> 00:05:36,521
I'll go to Master

129
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:37,922
to speak on your behalf.

130
00:05:39,841 --> 00:05:40,682
Eat something.

131
00:05:46,641 --> 00:05:47,802
Eat slowly.

132
00:05:47,961 --> 00:05:49,161
Don't choke.

133
00:05:49,322 --> 00:05:50,682
There's still a lot.

134
00:05:54,122 --> 00:05:55,122
Are you okay?

135
00:06:10,521 --> 00:06:11,281
Thank you.

136
00:06:12,682 --> 00:06:13,481
It's okay.

137
00:06:30,721 --> 00:06:32,202
Through countless hours

138
00:06:32,281 --> 00:06:34,322
of practice,

139
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:37,242
those ordinary people go
through the Human, Earth,

140
00:06:37,362 --> 00:06:38,721
and Heaven Levels

141
00:06:38,961 --> 00:06:40,401
and later reach the Meteor,

142
00:06:40,521 --> 00:06:42,442
Silver Moon, and Legend Levels

143
00:06:42,562 --> 00:06:43,442
as the Star Knights.

144
00:06:43,802 --> 00:06:44,601
Finally,

145
00:06:44,721 --> 00:06:46,161
they will transform

146
00:06:46,362 --> 00:06:48,762
into Transcendent Heroes

147
00:06:48,882 --> 00:06:51,161
with particle-like bodies.

148
00:06:52,401 --> 00:06:54,081
Through countless hours

149
00:06:54,521 --> 00:06:56,362
of practice,

150
00:06:57,081 --> 00:06:59,041
those ordinary people go
through the Human, Earth...

151
00:06:59,161 --> 00:06:59,961
Rong.

152
00:07:00,041 --> 00:07:01,281
and Heaven Levels...

153
00:07:01,562 --> 00:07:02,242
Master.

154
00:07:02,481 --> 00:07:03,961
and later reach the Meteor...

155
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,401
Why hasn't he left yet?

156
00:07:06,002 --> 00:07:07,442
He's still kneeling.

157
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:09,362
I know he's kneeling,

158
00:07:09,481 --> 00:07:10,362
but why is he reciting?

159
00:07:11,081 --> 00:07:12,521
So annoying.

160
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:14,961
I can't even sleep.

161
00:07:15,682 --> 00:07:16,802
But it really surprises me.

162
00:07:17,481 --> 00:07:18,081
He even recites

163
00:07:18,202 --> 00:07:19,922
such boring books.

164
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:21,161
Master,

165
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:23,041
why not let him in?

166
00:07:23,161 --> 00:07:24,721
It seems

167
00:07:24,802 --> 00:07:26,521
he might not leave all night.

168
00:07:26,641 --> 00:07:27,521
What if he recites here

169
00:07:27,562 --> 00:07:28,442
all night?

170
00:07:28,601 --> 00:07:29,041
Then you...

171
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,481
If he recites all night,

172
00:07:30,721 --> 00:07:32,641
I won't be able to sleep.

173
00:07:33,961 --> 00:07:35,202
Tell him to stop it.

174
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:37,961
Tell him to stop it. Go.

175
00:07:37,961 --> 00:07:38,641
Alright.

176
00:07:40,362 --> 00:07:42,481
At this time, they will transform

177
00:07:42,601 --> 00:07:44,202
into Transcendent Heroes...

178
00:07:44,202 --> 00:07:45,481
Stop it.

179
00:07:46,401 --> 00:07:47,202
Get up.

180
00:07:47,281 --> 00:07:48,641
Master agrees to let you in.

181
00:07:48,882 --> 00:07:49,721
Really?

182
00:07:55,922 --> 00:07:58,442
Boy.

183
00:07:58,562 --> 00:07:59,442
I didn't say

184
00:07:59,442 --> 00:08:00,802
I would accept you as a disciple.

185
00:08:00,922 --> 00:08:02,481
Sleep well tonight,

186
00:08:02,601 --> 00:08:04,002
and we'll talk about it tomorrow.

187
00:08:04,521 --> 00:08:05,242
Yes.

188
00:08:06,521 --> 00:08:07,242
Let's go.

189
00:08:22,041 --> 00:08:22,762
Mother.

190
00:08:27,896 --> 00:08:29,784
(Phoenix Inn)

191
00:08:31,281 --> 00:08:31,961
So is this

192
00:08:31,961 --> 00:08:33,202
their contact place?

193
00:08:33,562 --> 00:08:34,601
Let's see.

194
00:08:41,481 --> 00:08:43,481
He seems to be drawing
some kind of mark.

195
00:08:48,682 --> 00:08:49,922
What do the three of you want to buy?

196
00:08:52,562 --> 00:08:54,042
Knight Changfeng.

197
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:55,721
The person with the Hexagonal Fan

198
00:08:55,721 --> 00:08:56,802
in Dragon Mountain Empire.

199
00:08:56,922 --> 00:08:59,081
If it's not Knight Changfeng,
who else could it be?

200
00:08:59,402 --> 00:09:00,481
Knight Changfeng.

201
00:09:00,562 --> 00:09:01,802
Where is Knight Changfeng?

202
00:09:01,922 --> 00:09:03,081
I want to go to Chang...

203
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:06,202
It's you.

204
00:09:06,402 --> 00:09:07,402
My lady

205
00:09:07,402 --> 00:09:09,042
heard that you're going
to Changfeng Academy,

206
00:09:09,162 --> 00:09:11,601
so she's been practicing martial arts
in the weapon shop recently.

207
00:09:11,841 --> 00:09:12,881
She used

208
00:09:12,961 --> 00:09:14,601
to not even be able to hold a sword.

209
00:09:14,961 --> 00:09:16,961
Bitao, don't talk nonsense.

210
00:09:17,202 --> 00:09:17,922
Go back quickly.

211
00:09:19,322 --> 00:09:20,881
Don't listen to her nonsense.

212
00:09:21,042 --> 00:09:22,961
Everyone in Dragon Mountain Empire
knows martial arts.

213
00:09:22,961 --> 00:09:23,961
I want to learn too.

214
00:09:32,408 --> 00:09:34,424
(Phoenix Inn)

215
00:09:51,601 --> 00:09:52,721
It's the gray robe.

216
00:09:52,802 --> 00:09:53,402
Xueying,

217
00:09:53,402 --> 00:09:54,841
we saw him when we escorted Ge Bin.

218
00:09:54,961 --> 00:09:56,202
That's right. It's him.

219
00:10:08,481 --> 00:10:09,881
This gold coin is quite special.

220
00:10:10,522 --> 00:10:12,081
This is not an ordinary gold coin.

221
00:10:12,282 --> 00:10:13,442
This kind of gold coin

222
00:10:13,562 --> 00:10:15,282
can only appear in one place.

223
00:10:15,642 --> 00:10:16,682
The Bloodshed Tavern.

224
00:10:27,802 --> 00:10:29,042
Greetings, Second Priest.

225
00:10:34,162 --> 00:10:35,001
Second Priest,

226
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:36,721
Ge Bin has been dealt with.

227
00:10:37,481 --> 00:10:40,481
That waste deserved to die long ago.

228
00:10:41,361 --> 00:10:43,162
Now the number of demons is not enough.

229
00:10:43,562 --> 00:10:44,922
With their power,

230
00:10:45,042 --> 00:10:46,282
they can't make a difference.

231
00:10:46,761 --> 00:10:48,402
They are of no use at all.

232
00:10:48,601 --> 00:10:49,721
The Ocean Realm Stone...

233
00:10:49,841 --> 00:10:50,562
People of the Dragon Mountain Empire

234
00:10:50,682 --> 00:10:51,881
are already on guard.

235
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,841
Now it's impossible to

236
00:10:54,001 --> 00:10:55,282
get back the realm stone.

237
00:10:55,682 --> 00:10:56,442
Deal with those demons

238
00:10:56,562 --> 00:10:57,522
as soon as possible.

239
00:10:57,642 --> 00:10:58,241
Understood.

240
00:10:58,402 --> 00:10:59,162
Tonight, I'll make them

241
00:10:59,282 --> 00:11:00,042
all disappear.

242
00:11:00,162 --> 00:11:00,682
No.

243
00:11:00,922 --> 00:11:02,001
Since they're going to die anyway,

244
00:11:02,001 --> 00:11:03,601
let them play more roles.

245
00:11:03,721 --> 00:11:05,642
Let those elders have a good look.

246
00:11:05,802 --> 00:11:06,841
Consider it a gift

247
00:11:06,961 --> 00:11:08,081
for them.

248
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,081
So you mean...?

249
00:11:10,881 --> 00:11:12,361
Take them to the sealed well

250
00:11:12,761 --> 00:11:14,961
in Nanqin.

251
00:11:15,081 --> 00:11:16,402
Letting them break the Demon Well?

252
00:11:16,481 --> 00:11:17,241
But...

253
00:11:17,361 --> 00:11:19,322
Of course, they can't do it.

254
00:11:19,442 --> 00:11:20,961
But they're somewhat useful

255
00:11:21,642 --> 00:11:23,562
and will help more Abyss Demons

256
00:11:23,682 --> 00:11:24,922
enter here

257
00:11:25,001 --> 00:11:26,562
and make those elders

258
00:11:26,642 --> 00:11:28,761
worried.

259
00:11:30,162 --> 00:11:31,601
Your brilliance is unmatched.

260
00:11:33,121 --> 00:11:34,562
We are getting closer and closer

261
00:11:34,761 --> 00:11:36,241
to success.

262
00:11:37,081 --> 00:11:38,202
Great Demon God,

263
00:11:38,562 --> 00:11:39,601
revive.

264
00:11:43,207 --> 00:11:46,168
(Nanqin City)

265
00:11:47,448 --> 00:11:49,080
(Situ Hong)

266
00:11:49,881 --> 00:11:51,682
(Si Borong)
It's so boring.

267
00:11:53,121 --> 00:11:54,522
Brother,

268
00:11:54,642 --> 00:11:55,442
why does Aunt

269
00:11:55,481 --> 00:11:56,961
ask these people to guard here?

270
00:11:57,121 --> 00:11:57,881
Is there any treasure

271
00:11:58,001 --> 00:11:59,721
in this barren place?

272
00:11:59,961 --> 00:12:01,522
Many years ago, during the great battle
between Gods and Demons,

273
00:12:01,642 --> 00:12:02,402
the Great Demon God

274
00:12:02,522 --> 00:12:03,802
entered the Dragon Mountain Empire

275
00:12:03,881 --> 00:12:05,202
through the Demon Well.

276
00:12:05,682 --> 00:12:07,121
Later, the gods descended

277
00:12:07,282 --> 00:12:09,202
and completely sealed the well,

278
00:12:09,361 --> 00:12:10,361
making these demons

279
00:12:10,481 --> 00:12:11,881
retreat back into the Dark Abyss.

280
00:12:12,361 --> 00:12:14,042
It's been so long.

281
00:12:14,202 --> 00:12:15,922
Gods or demons

282
00:12:16,081 --> 00:12:17,562
don't have the power to come anymore.

283
00:12:17,721 --> 00:12:18,361
Why do we have to

284
00:12:18,361 --> 00:12:19,522
keep guarding here?

285
00:12:19,642 --> 00:12:20,442
It's too boring.

286
00:12:20,562 --> 00:12:21,881
This place is of great importance.

287
00:12:22,202 --> 00:12:23,402
Since Aunt ordered you and me

288
00:12:23,402 --> 00:12:24,601
to patrol this place,

289
00:12:25,522 --> 00:12:27,121
we must not take it lightly.

290
00:12:27,282 --> 00:12:29,642
Brother, you're too serious.

291
00:12:29,802 --> 00:12:31,042
Relax a bit.

292
00:12:31,202 --> 00:12:32,001
Look,

293
00:12:32,282 --> 00:12:34,001
buddies are tired now.

294
00:12:34,121 --> 00:12:35,802
Why don't we all sit down

295
00:12:35,922 --> 00:12:37,202
and have a party for some rest?

296
00:12:37,322 --> 00:12:38,361
Absolutely not.

297
00:12:39,361 --> 00:12:40,202
If anything

298
00:12:40,361 --> 00:12:41,481
goes wrong here,

299
00:12:41,761 --> 00:12:42,282
it's not something

300
00:12:42,402 --> 00:12:43,721
we can bear the responsibility for.

301
00:12:43,841 --> 00:12:45,562
What could go wrong?

302
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,121
If you don't want to,

303
00:12:47,241 --> 00:12:48,442
then I'll take buddies

304
00:12:48,442 --> 00:12:49,361
to have some fun.

305
00:12:49,481 --> 00:12:50,081
Borong.

306
00:12:50,081 --> 00:12:51,322
Everyone, come on.

307
00:12:51,442 --> 00:12:52,361
Do you want to drink?

308
00:12:52,361 --> 00:12:53,121
- Yes!
- Yes!

309
00:12:53,121 --> 00:12:53,881
Come on.

310
00:12:53,881 --> 00:12:55,601
No drinking during guard duty.

311
00:12:55,601 --> 00:12:56,961
Don't listen to him.

312
00:12:57,081 --> 00:12:57,761
Just listen to me.

313
00:12:57,802 --> 00:12:58,721
Let's go drink.

314
00:12:58,721 --> 00:12:59,961
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

315
00:12:59,961 --> 00:13:00,642
Borong.

316
00:13:09,081 --> 00:13:10,642
Come on.

317
00:13:11,721 --> 00:13:12,601
Eat.

318
00:13:13,761 --> 00:13:15,001
- Eat!
- Eat!

319
00:13:15,121 --> 00:13:16,361
- Drink!
- Drink!

320
00:13:16,562 --> 00:13:18,042
Your turn!

321
00:13:25,162 --> 00:13:27,922
- Come on!
- Cheers!

322
00:13:30,402 --> 00:13:32,322
- Drink up.
- Fill his cup.

323
00:13:41,881 --> 00:13:43,642
This is from that Gray Robe?

324
00:13:43,802 --> 00:13:44,322
Right.

325
00:13:45,922 --> 00:13:47,282
So the Bloodshed Tavern

326
00:13:47,442 --> 00:13:49,322
really has a connection
with the Demon God Association.

327
00:13:49,601 --> 00:13:51,601
I knew it was her!

328
00:13:51,841 --> 00:13:53,282
It used to be one

329
00:13:53,402 --> 00:13:55,322
of the six Transcendent organizations.

330
00:13:55,522 --> 00:13:57,361
Now, she always keeps to herself

331
00:13:57,481 --> 00:13:59,162
and even doesn't attend
the meetings of our council.

332
00:13:59,361 --> 00:14:00,481
She must be in cahoots

333
00:14:00,481 --> 00:14:01,322
with the Demon Clan now.

334
00:14:01,442 --> 00:14:02,682
This is the evidence.

335
00:14:02,881 --> 00:14:04,562
Tai Shu, it's too early

336
00:14:04,682 --> 00:14:05,841
to jump to conclusions.

337
00:14:06,322 --> 00:14:07,961
Ye Mei was traumatized

338
00:14:07,961 --> 00:14:09,001
by the Bloodshed God Emperor's incident,

339
00:14:09,121 --> 00:14:09,881
and her personality changed drastically.

340
00:14:10,001 --> 00:14:11,081
But in the great battle back then,

341
00:14:11,202 --> 00:14:12,522
she didn't hesitate

342
00:14:12,642 --> 00:14:14,001
to seal the Demon God's body at all.

343
00:14:14,241 --> 00:14:15,042
It shows

344
00:14:15,202 --> 00:14:16,922
that she can make the right decision.

345
00:14:17,162 --> 00:14:18,601
So many years have passed.

346
00:14:18,721 --> 00:14:21,721
Anyone may change.

347
00:14:21,841 --> 00:14:23,402
Hasn't she changed enough?

348
00:14:23,922 --> 00:14:24,442
Don't you know

349
00:14:24,442 --> 00:14:25,601
the reputation of her Bloodshed Tavern

350
00:14:25,601 --> 00:14:26,601
over the years?

351
00:14:26,721 --> 00:14:28,642
As long as you give enough bounty,

352
00:14:28,721 --> 00:14:29,922
no matter whom you kill,

353
00:14:30,042 --> 00:14:31,202
someone will take the job.

354
00:14:31,322 --> 00:14:33,402
Is that the right decision you said?

355
00:14:34,642 --> 00:14:36,121
The identities of her men

356
00:14:36,282 --> 00:14:37,642
are unknown.

357
00:14:37,802 --> 00:14:38,642
It's possible

358
00:14:38,802 --> 00:14:40,481
that some demons are hiding among them.

359
00:14:40,642 --> 00:14:42,282
If Ye Mei really colludes
with the Demon Clan,

360
00:14:42,402 --> 00:14:43,881
we will not tolerate it.

361
00:14:44,001 --> 00:14:45,642
We won't spare her either.

362
00:14:45,761 --> 00:14:46,522
Alright.

363
00:14:48,121 --> 00:14:50,042
Tomorrow we'll go
to the Bloodshed Tavern.

364
00:14:50,642 --> 00:14:51,642
Xueying and Jingqiu

365
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:52,721
have seen that Gray Robe.

366
00:14:52,841 --> 00:14:53,601
If he's really

367
00:14:53,601 --> 00:14:55,402
an assassin from the Bloodshed Tavern,

368
00:14:55,682 --> 00:14:57,761
then Ye Mei can't hide him.

369
00:15:06,721 --> 00:15:07,481
Drink.

370
00:15:08,162 --> 00:15:09,322
Get up and drink.

371
00:15:10,081 --> 00:15:10,881
Get up.

372
00:15:19,282 --> 00:15:19,961
Stop!

373
00:15:24,881 --> 00:15:26,761
This is the forbidden area
of the Dragon Mountain Empire.

374
00:15:26,961 --> 00:15:29,282
Trespassers will be killed
without mercy.

375
00:15:38,682 --> 00:15:40,642
Demons! Everyone, gather!

376
00:15:52,241 --> 00:15:53,042
Demons!

377
00:15:53,162 --> 00:15:53,802
Let's go.

378
00:15:58,761 --> 00:16:00,601
Si Borong, go for Aunt.

379
00:16:00,761 --> 00:16:01,282
Alright.

380
00:16:17,272 --> 00:16:19,160
(Si Court)

381
00:16:23,841 --> 00:16:24,682
Aunt, Aunt!

382
00:16:24,682 --> 00:16:25,402
We're in trouble.

383
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:26,322
The demons have come.

384
00:16:26,322 --> 00:16:27,453
(Si Lianghong)

385
00:17:06,872 --> 00:17:08,856
(True Meaning of Void Shift)

386
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:49,362
Are you alright?

387
00:18:18,602 --> 00:18:19,922
Aunt.

388
00:18:22,082 --> 00:18:22,682
Come.

389
00:18:26,801 --> 00:18:27,402
(Why didn't Aunt)

390
00:18:27,561 --> 00:18:28,642
(even look at me?)

391
00:18:29,481 --> 00:18:31,442
(She didn't even bother
to slap and scold me.)

392
00:18:35,761 --> 00:18:36,761
Please forgive me for my incompetence.

393
00:18:36,922 --> 00:18:37,961
I'm here to report.

394
00:18:38,122 --> 00:18:39,761
The Demon Clan attacked the Demon Well

395
00:18:39,922 --> 00:18:41,402
and caused a crack.

396
00:18:41,561 --> 00:18:42,882
Although we tried our best to defend

397
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:43,961
and fixed the crack,

398
00:18:44,122 --> 00:18:45,602
some Abyss Demons

399
00:18:45,721 --> 00:18:47,122
still entered our empire.

400
00:18:47,281 --> 00:18:48,041
What?

401
00:19:12,922 --> 00:19:13,922
Where did all those demons

402
00:19:13,922 --> 00:19:15,041
attacking the Demon Well come from?

403
00:19:15,281 --> 00:19:16,281
They were created demons.

404
00:19:16,442 --> 00:19:17,122
Thousands of demons

405
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:18,521
were newly created.

406
00:19:18,561 --> 00:19:20,402
Thousands of demons?

407
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:23,602
The Demon Clan knew they cannot be
a force to be reckoned with,

408
00:19:23,961 --> 00:19:25,442
so they used

409
00:19:25,442 --> 00:19:26,801
the demonized Ocean Realm Stone

410
00:19:26,801 --> 00:19:27,801
to transform people into demons

411
00:19:28,281 --> 00:19:30,922
and then used them
to break the Demon Well.

412
00:19:31,162 --> 00:19:32,642
Your disciples

413
00:19:32,642 --> 00:19:33,842
are really impressive.

414
00:19:34,082 --> 00:19:36,041
Not only losing the Ocean Realm Stone,

415
00:19:36,202 --> 00:19:38,442
but also letting the demons
break the Demon Well.

416
00:19:38,682 --> 00:19:40,162
Fortunately, it's just a crack,

417
00:19:40,281 --> 00:19:41,481
and the well hasn't been destroyed.

418
00:19:41,642 --> 00:19:43,442
Just a crack

419
00:19:43,602 --> 00:19:44,442
has already allowed

420
00:19:44,442 --> 00:19:45,721
so many Abyss Demons to enter here.

421
00:19:46,041 --> 00:19:47,202
You should know

422
00:19:47,801 --> 00:19:48,561
those demons

423
00:19:48,561 --> 00:19:49,761
are much more powerful and ferocious

424
00:19:49,922 --> 00:19:51,682
than ordinary demons.

425
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:52,561
Those demons

426
00:19:52,721 --> 00:19:54,402
are indistinguishable
from ordinary people

427
00:19:54,682 --> 00:19:56,082
before they reveal their true forms.

428
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,721
To catch them

429
00:19:57,922 --> 00:20:00,561
is like finding a needle in a haystack.

430
00:20:01,041 --> 00:20:02,321
It's all my fault
for not guarding well enough.

431
00:20:02,481 --> 00:20:03,721
Of course it is.

432
00:20:03,961 --> 00:20:05,362
Each faction

433
00:20:05,481 --> 00:20:06,602
takes turns guarding it

434
00:20:06,761 --> 00:20:08,082
every ten years.

435
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:09,402
Why is it that there's an oversight

436
00:20:09,402 --> 00:20:10,442
exactly during your shift?

437
00:20:11,402 --> 00:20:12,521
The top priority

438
00:20:12,642 --> 00:20:14,281
is to strengthen the defense
of the Demon Well.

439
00:20:16,521 --> 00:20:18,442
Since you can't guard it,

440
00:20:18,602 --> 00:20:19,801
let someone else do it.

441
00:20:20,682 --> 00:20:22,481
Knight Changfeng, you guard it.

442
00:20:22,761 --> 00:20:23,521
He also has to deal with

443
00:20:23,521 --> 00:20:24,761
affairs of Changfeng Academy.

444
00:20:24,882 --> 00:20:27,041
I'm afraid he can't handle both.

445
00:20:27,721 --> 00:20:29,321
Since the demons have entered here,

446
00:20:29,481 --> 00:20:30,882
they will definitely take action.

447
00:20:31,041 --> 00:20:32,082
At this time,

448
00:20:32,281 --> 00:20:33,602
we need to be more united.

449
00:20:34,362 --> 00:20:36,041
Although the Si Family
made a mistake this time,

450
00:20:36,202 --> 00:20:37,122
they have guarded

451
00:20:37,241 --> 00:20:39,202
Nanqin for many years

452
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:40,882
and known

453
00:20:41,001 --> 00:20:42,001
how to guard it well.

454
00:20:42,122 --> 00:20:43,082
I think

455
00:20:43,362 --> 00:20:44,961
we should give them a chance

456
00:20:45,122 --> 00:20:46,922
to make up for their mistake.

457
00:20:47,082 --> 00:20:47,882
What do you think?

458
00:20:49,842 --> 00:20:51,162
Why not let the Si Family

459
00:20:51,961 --> 00:20:53,721
guard Nanqin forever,

460
00:20:53,882 --> 00:20:55,041
and take care of the Demon Well.

461
00:20:55,321 --> 00:20:56,442
It's both a punishment

462
00:20:56,561 --> 00:20:57,721
and a redemption.

463
00:20:57,801 --> 00:20:58,561
I believe

464
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:00,761
that with the strength
of the Si Family Army,

465
00:21:00,882 --> 00:21:02,362
there won't be any more problems.

466
00:21:02,481 --> 00:21:03,162
Well...

467
00:21:04,082 --> 00:21:05,402
Right.

468
00:21:05,561 --> 00:21:07,082
With such a big problem,

469
00:21:07,321 --> 00:21:08,001
you can't be trying

470
00:21:08,001 --> 00:21:09,561
to protect your disciples, can you?

471
00:21:09,721 --> 00:21:10,882
Tai Shu.

472
00:21:12,162 --> 00:21:13,922
Thank you for your admonition.

473
00:21:14,122 --> 00:21:16,321
I will guard Nanqin forever

474
00:21:16,321 --> 00:21:17,321
and instruct our younger generations

475
00:21:17,402 --> 00:21:19,761
to atone for our negligence.

476
00:21:25,122 --> 00:21:26,362
- What?
- What?

477
00:21:27,362 --> 00:21:29,162
Staying here forever?

478
00:21:29,281 --> 00:21:31,561
Aunt, it was agreed back then

479
00:21:31,721 --> 00:21:32,402
that the major factions

480
00:21:32,402 --> 00:21:33,521
would take turns
guarding that darn well.

481
00:21:33,642 --> 00:21:34,882
Now nine years have passed.

482
00:21:35,001 --> 00:21:35,801
We may not have made
great contributions,

483
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:36,882
but we have worked hard.

484
00:21:37,041 --> 00:21:38,521
Confining you here forever

485
00:21:38,682 --> 00:21:40,321
just because of this one mistake

486
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,922
is too unreasonable.

487
00:21:42,082 --> 00:21:42,842
Your merits

488
00:21:42,842 --> 00:21:44,162
are not remembered by others,

489
00:21:44,321 --> 00:21:45,642
but the mistakes you made

490
00:21:45,801 --> 00:21:47,882
are clearly visible to them.

491
00:21:49,001 --> 00:21:51,001
If they said our family
was not strong enough

492
00:21:51,122 --> 00:21:52,241
to resist the demons,

493
00:21:52,241 --> 00:21:53,082
I would admit it.

494
00:21:53,202 --> 00:21:55,122
But if they said we neglected our duty,

495
00:21:55,122 --> 00:21:56,481
I would never admit it.

496
00:21:56,602 --> 00:21:57,842
One by one,

497
00:21:57,842 --> 00:21:59,321
those who fell near the Demon Well

498
00:21:59,922 --> 00:22:01,602
were our family members.

499
00:22:01,842 --> 00:22:03,481
I think they want you to stay here

500
00:22:03,642 --> 00:22:04,642
for the rest of your life
just because they don't want

501
00:22:04,642 --> 00:22:05,442
to guard it.

502
00:22:05,442 --> 00:22:07,001
Borong, Hong,

503
00:22:07,362 --> 00:22:08,481
don't say such things

504
00:22:08,481 --> 00:22:09,241
in broad daylight.

505
00:22:09,241 --> 00:22:10,521
If someone hears it,

506
00:22:10,602 --> 00:22:12,362
it won't do our family any good.

507
00:22:12,521 --> 00:22:13,321
I know.

508
00:22:13,561 --> 00:22:15,961
I just say it at home.

509
00:22:19,281 --> 00:22:21,642
Today, I will teach you a lesson.

510
00:22:21,801 --> 00:22:23,481
Only by becoming strong

511
00:22:23,481 --> 00:22:25,162
can you have a say.

512
00:22:25,362 --> 00:22:27,122
If you are not strong enough,

513
00:22:27,281 --> 00:22:29,082
you can only be a listener.

514
00:22:31,082 --> 00:22:32,682
In order to fix the Demon Well,

515
00:22:32,882 --> 00:22:33,602
I'm not as strong

516
00:22:33,602 --> 00:22:34,961
as I used to be.

517
00:22:35,122 --> 00:22:37,362
You youngsters are far behind.

518
00:22:38,122 --> 00:22:39,922
Changfeng Academy has cultivated

519
00:22:39,922 --> 00:22:41,801
many outstanding disciples.

520
00:22:42,041 --> 00:22:43,801
Now the entrance examination
is approaching.

521
00:22:44,442 --> 00:22:45,801
You two should go together

522
00:22:45,882 --> 00:22:47,882
and seize this opportunity.

523
00:22:48,442 --> 00:22:49,281
Aunt,

524
00:22:49,801 --> 00:22:50,961
I don't want to go.

525
00:22:51,122 --> 00:22:51,961
Rong,

526
00:22:52,122 --> 00:22:53,202
do you want to stay here

527
00:22:53,202 --> 00:22:54,882
like me for the rest of your life?

528
00:22:55,241 --> 00:22:56,001
Aunt,

529
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,041
if we both go to

530
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,082
Changfeng Academy,

531
00:22:58,082 --> 00:22:59,602
what if the demons

532
00:22:59,761 --> 00:23:00,561
invade again?

533
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:01,721
Don't worry.

534
00:23:01,882 --> 00:23:03,362
We will strengthen our defenses.

535
00:23:03,561 --> 00:23:05,202
They just launched a surprise attack,

536
00:23:05,362 --> 00:23:06,481
so they probably won't come again

537
00:23:06,481 --> 00:23:07,362
in a short period of time.

538
00:23:09,801 --> 00:23:11,362
Sending you to Changfeng Academy

539
00:23:11,481 --> 00:23:12,922
is to improve your cultivation

540
00:23:13,041 --> 00:23:14,082
and become stronger.

541
00:23:14,321 --> 00:23:15,922
Only by that

542
00:23:16,082 --> 00:23:16,842
can you avoid

543
00:23:17,001 --> 00:23:18,561
being bullied in the future.

544
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:21,882
Alright.

545
00:23:22,122 --> 00:23:23,842
You two go pack up your things.

546
00:23:25,162 --> 00:23:26,281
Remember

547
00:23:26,442 --> 00:23:27,602
to take care of each other

548
00:23:27,761 --> 00:23:28,961
when you get to Changfeng Academy.

549
00:23:29,521 --> 00:23:30,281
Alright.

550
00:23:30,561 --> 00:23:31,561
I'll practice hard

551
00:23:31,682 --> 00:23:33,041
and strive to become Transcendent.

552
00:23:33,362 --> 00:23:34,801
I won't disgrace our family.

553
00:23:46,602 --> 00:23:48,241
It's as peaceful here
as in the Xueying Territory.

554
00:23:48,362 --> 00:23:49,241
Who could have imagined

555
00:23:49,321 --> 00:23:49,682
that a battle with demons

556
00:23:49,682 --> 00:23:51,001
took place here last night?

557
00:23:51,001 --> 00:23:52,402
If it could always be this peaceful,

558
00:23:52,402 --> 00:23:53,402
that would be so nice.

559
00:23:54,082 --> 00:23:55,481
Everything we do

560
00:23:55,642 --> 00:23:57,041
is to protect the peace.

561
00:23:57,321 --> 00:23:58,122
This time the Demon Well

562
00:23:58,281 --> 00:23:59,402
was attacked by demons.

563
00:23:59,602 --> 00:24:01,561
It was due to Si Family's negligence,

564
00:24:01,922 --> 00:24:03,842
but they have been punished.

565
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,281
Don't let this unintentional mistake

566
00:24:06,402 --> 00:24:07,481
affect the unity

567
00:24:07,642 --> 00:24:08,682
among our factions.

568
00:24:08,882 --> 00:24:09,602
Xi Yun,

569
00:24:10,281 --> 00:24:11,241
I dislike it

570
00:24:11,241 --> 00:24:12,642
when you talk like this.

571
00:24:12,961 --> 00:24:14,721
A mistake is a mistake.

572
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:16,122
What do you mean
by unintentional mistake?

573
00:24:16,241 --> 00:24:17,602
Who would intentionally make mistakes?

574
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:18,281
Right,

575
00:24:18,442 --> 00:24:19,402
she was punished.

576
00:24:19,402 --> 00:24:20,442
But so what?

577
00:24:20,602 --> 00:24:22,321
The demons still got in.

578
00:24:22,481 --> 00:24:23,481
For decades,

579
00:24:23,682 --> 00:24:24,481
we haven't been able
to find the location

580
00:24:24,481 --> 00:24:25,842
of the Demon God Association.

581
00:24:26,041 --> 00:24:27,402
Those infiltrated demons

582
00:24:27,561 --> 00:24:29,402
are hiding around us.

583
00:24:29,602 --> 00:24:30,442
And you're still talking

584
00:24:30,561 --> 00:24:31,682
about unintentional mistakes.

585
00:24:31,801 --> 00:24:33,481
- Tai Shu.
- Tai Shu.

586
00:24:33,642 --> 00:24:35,402
Stop complaining.

587
00:24:35,561 --> 00:24:36,882
The most important thing now

588
00:24:36,882 --> 00:24:37,842
is to think of a strategy

589
00:24:38,001 --> 00:24:39,442
to deal with the demons.

590
00:24:40,202 --> 00:24:40,961
I think

591
00:24:40,961 --> 00:24:42,281
we should go to the Bloodshed Tavern.

592
00:24:42,442 --> 00:24:43,402
There might be clues there.

593
00:24:43,481 --> 00:24:45,122
Then why waste time talking?

594
00:24:45,281 --> 00:24:46,162
No more dawdling

595
00:24:46,241 --> 00:24:47,481
and don't let them get away.

596
00:24:47,642 --> 00:24:48,842
But there's a problem.

597
00:24:49,801 --> 00:24:50,761
If we go there,

598
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:52,761
can you recognize the killer?

599
00:24:52,882 --> 00:24:53,842
We fought with him.

600
00:24:54,202 --> 00:24:55,922
He has scars from my Hexagonal Fan.

601
00:24:56,362 --> 00:24:57,521
As long as we find him,

602
00:24:57,721 --> 00:24:59,362
maybe we can follow clues

603
00:24:59,362 --> 00:25:00,321
and find the location
of the Demon God Association.

604
00:25:01,321 --> 00:25:03,281
Now the demons' tracks are unknown.

605
00:25:03,442 --> 00:25:04,922
We must be on high alert.

606
00:25:05,281 --> 00:25:06,922
We'll go back and deploy
as soon as possible

607
00:25:07,082 --> 00:25:08,602
so as not to be attacked by the demons.

608
00:25:09,442 --> 00:25:10,442
Alright.

609
00:25:10,922 --> 00:25:12,162
I'll go with you.

610
00:25:12,721 --> 00:25:14,561
I've already ordered
my disciples to be on alert

611
00:25:14,561 --> 00:25:16,321
after the demons' attack on Nanqin City.

612
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:17,202
There's no problem.

613
00:25:17,481 --> 00:25:18,682
Ye Mei

614
00:25:18,682 --> 00:25:20,122
won't be so easy to deal with.

615
00:25:21,041 --> 00:25:22,241
You all go together.

616
00:25:22,642 --> 00:25:23,761
You fought with him,

617
00:25:23,922 --> 00:25:25,721
and if he's there,
you can help identify him.

618
00:25:25,922 --> 00:25:26,922
Knight Changfeng,

619
00:25:26,922 --> 00:25:28,202
I came to you

620
00:25:28,442 --> 00:25:29,842
because I want to enter
Changfeng Academy.

621
00:25:30,202 --> 00:25:31,082
There are still a few days left

622
00:25:31,082 --> 00:25:32,082
before the entrance exam.

623
00:25:32,362 --> 00:25:33,922
After going to the Bloodshed Tavern,

624
00:25:34,122 --> 00:25:35,001
I'll take you back.

625
00:25:35,162 --> 00:25:36,442
You can prepare then.
It won't be too late.

626
00:25:37,001 --> 00:25:38,041
That's fine.

627
00:25:38,082 --> 00:25:38,761
Xueying,

628
00:25:38,922 --> 00:25:40,481
you can stay
at the Water Daoist Temple for now.

629
00:25:40,602 --> 00:25:42,642
Jingqiu will take the entrance exam too.

630
00:25:42,801 --> 00:25:44,842
By that time, you can go together.

631
00:25:46,321 --> 00:25:47,041
Yes.

632
00:25:47,202 --> 00:25:48,761
I'll follow your orders.

633
00:25:50,402 --> 00:25:51,561
The entrance exam for Changfeng Academy

634
00:25:51,561 --> 00:25:52,721
is not so easy.

635
00:25:52,922 --> 00:25:53,922
Maybe during the exam,

636
00:25:54,082 --> 00:25:55,202
we'll be competitors.

637
00:25:55,481 --> 00:25:56,162
To be able to compete

638
00:25:56,162 --> 00:25:57,082
with an outstanding mage

639
00:25:57,082 --> 00:25:57,761
like you

640
00:25:57,922 --> 00:25:58,922
is my honor.

641
00:25:59,202 --> 00:25:59,961
But,

642
00:26:00,122 --> 00:26:01,761
I'm looking forward to becoming
a fellow disciple with you even more.

643
00:26:07,128 --> 00:26:10,232
(Bloodshed Tavern)

644
00:26:15,281 --> 00:26:16,281
What's the matter?

645
00:26:17,041 --> 00:26:18,602
I need a bottle of Emerald Styptic.

646
00:26:32,202 --> 00:26:34,882
It can only heal open wounds.

647
00:26:45,202 --> 00:26:47,521
Your strength
has suffered considerable damage.

648
00:26:48,241 --> 00:26:49,922
Take some Purple Jade Pills to recover.

649
00:27:07,561 --> 00:27:09,241
Master, you're here.

650
00:27:09,442 --> 00:27:11,122
How many times has he come
to get medicine?

651
00:27:11,321 --> 00:27:12,481
If I remember correctly,

652
00:27:12,682 --> 00:27:14,281
this should be the third time
this month.

653
00:27:15,202 --> 00:27:17,481
He's taken medicine
three times this month,

654
00:27:18,602 --> 00:27:20,402
and his strength is depleted,

655
00:27:21,402 --> 00:27:22,481
yet he hasn't completed

656
00:27:22,481 --> 00:27:23,521
a single mission.

657
00:27:23,721 --> 00:27:25,801
He hasn't brought back a single penny.

658
00:27:26,001 --> 00:27:26,842
Has he been fighting

659
00:27:27,041 --> 00:27:28,721
himself?

660
00:27:29,602 --> 00:27:30,481
Master,

661
00:27:30,642 --> 00:27:31,602
in my opinion,

662
00:27:31,801 --> 00:27:33,561
Xiang Pangyun was probably injured

663
00:27:33,561 --> 00:27:35,241
by Knight Changfeng.

664
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:38,082
He was injured by Chi Qiubai?

665
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:40,162
The Hexagonal Fan used
by Knight Changfeng

666
00:27:40,362 --> 00:27:41,402
is unique in the world.

667
00:27:41,602 --> 00:27:43,122
The wound says it all.

668
00:27:43,642 --> 00:27:45,602
Xiang Pangyun seems

669
00:27:45,602 --> 00:27:46,761
to be hiding something on purpose.

670
00:27:46,922 --> 00:27:48,122
Behind Chi Qiubai's back

671
00:27:48,122 --> 00:27:50,801
are Changfeng Academy
and the Water Daoist Temple.

672
00:27:51,082 --> 00:27:53,922
Offending him isn't a good thing.

673
00:27:54,281 --> 00:27:55,602
I don't care what's between him

674
00:27:55,761 --> 00:27:56,922
and Knight Changfeng.

675
00:27:57,122 --> 00:27:58,202
Just don't bring trouble

676
00:27:58,202 --> 00:27:59,402
to my tavern.

677
00:28:00,362 --> 00:28:01,281
- Where's Ye Mei?
- Sir.

678
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:02,122
- Sir.
- Come out!

679
00:28:02,682 --> 00:28:03,961
It's common
for our master to be elusive.

680
00:28:03,961 --> 00:28:05,001
If you have something to say,

681
00:28:05,041 --> 00:28:05,961
leave a message

682
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:07,321
and I can pass it on for you.

683
00:28:07,362 --> 00:28:08,721
Who do you think you are?

684
00:28:08,882 --> 00:28:10,082
We have important business with her.

685
00:28:10,281 --> 00:28:11,402
I didn't expect the Bloodshed Tavern

686
00:28:11,521 --> 00:28:12,561
to look like this.

687
00:28:12,561 --> 00:28:13,602
I'll go get some good dishes first.

688
00:28:13,721 --> 00:28:14,561
No need.

689
00:28:14,721 --> 00:28:15,521
Ye Mei!

690
00:28:18,001 --> 00:28:18,801
I thought

691
00:28:18,801 --> 00:28:20,721
it was only Knight Changfeng.

692
00:28:20,842 --> 00:28:21,281
Master.

693
00:28:21,402 --> 00:28:22,842
You all came.

694
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:23,961
Since you're here,

695
00:28:24,082 --> 00:28:25,321
why not try

696
00:28:25,442 --> 00:28:26,801
my tavern's aged fine wine?

697
00:28:26,961 --> 00:28:27,882
Go get some wine.

698
00:28:28,001 --> 00:28:28,682
Yes.

699
00:28:28,801 --> 00:28:30,362
We're not here to drink.

700
00:28:33,602 --> 00:28:34,882
Not drinking?

701
00:28:35,842 --> 00:28:37,241
Are you here

702
00:28:37,362 --> 00:28:39,202
to hire an assassin too?

703
00:28:39,961 --> 00:28:42,281
We treat everyone equally.

704
00:28:42,402 --> 00:28:44,801
How much bounty do you want to offer?

705
00:28:44,961 --> 00:28:45,922
Ye Mei,

706
00:28:46,602 --> 00:28:47,842
if you continue like this,

707
00:28:47,961 --> 00:28:48,561
do you believe

708
00:28:48,642 --> 00:28:50,602
I'll smash your tavern?

709
00:28:52,041 --> 00:28:52,882
Master Ye,

710
00:28:53,001 --> 00:28:54,001
sorry

711
00:28:54,122 --> 00:28:55,122
for the sudden visit.

712
00:28:55,321 --> 00:28:56,561
There's someone involved
in a major case,

713
00:28:56,642 --> 00:28:57,642
and we want to ask you about him.

714
00:28:58,041 --> 00:28:59,761
Why don't you

715
00:28:59,842 --> 00:29:01,481
go to the Dragon Mountain Mansion?

716
00:29:01,721 --> 00:29:04,281
We don't do inquiries.

717
00:29:04,561 --> 00:29:05,521
We understand the rules,

718
00:29:05,642 --> 00:29:06,442
and we have money.

719
00:29:07,761 --> 00:29:09,082
Young man,

720
00:29:09,162 --> 00:29:10,561
in this world,

721
00:29:10,642 --> 00:29:11,842
not everything

722
00:29:11,961 --> 00:29:13,761
can be solved with money.

723
00:29:14,481 --> 00:29:16,281
But maybe

724
00:29:16,442 --> 00:29:17,801
some things can.

725
00:29:25,241 --> 00:29:27,202
Take a close look at this.

726
00:29:27,321 --> 00:29:27,922
Is it

727
00:29:28,001 --> 00:29:29,721
from your tavern?

728
00:29:30,761 --> 00:29:32,402
So what?

729
00:29:32,761 --> 00:29:34,001
Maybe someone

730
00:29:34,162 --> 00:29:36,001
dropped it by accident,

731
00:29:36,122 --> 00:29:37,642
and someone else picked it up.

732
00:29:37,761 --> 00:29:38,882
To ordinary people,

733
00:29:39,001 --> 00:29:40,281
this is just a gold coin.

734
00:29:40,402 --> 00:29:41,842
But in your tavern,

735
00:29:41,961 --> 00:29:43,001
only assassins

736
00:29:43,122 --> 00:29:45,082
can have such a thing.

737
00:29:45,362 --> 00:29:46,202
Master Ye,

738
00:29:46,362 --> 00:29:47,362
call all the assassins out,

739
00:29:47,362 --> 00:29:48,321
and we'll identify them.

740
00:29:48,402 --> 00:29:49,801
Then the truth will be revealed.

741
00:29:50,281 --> 00:29:51,602
I refuse.

742
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:52,842
Ye Mei,

743
00:29:53,922 --> 00:29:55,162
in the past, Shan Liuyun

744
00:29:55,162 --> 00:29:57,122
established this Bloodshed Tavern,

745
00:29:57,842 --> 00:29:59,041
which was one

746
00:29:59,041 --> 00:30:01,001
of the six Transcendent organizations
along with our factions.

747
00:30:01,362 --> 00:30:02,241
And he joined us all in protecting

748
00:30:02,362 --> 00:30:04,122
the Dragon Mountain Empire.

749
00:30:04,682 --> 00:30:05,761
He was even hailed

750
00:30:05,882 --> 00:30:07,082
as the Bloodshed God Emperor.

751
00:30:07,521 --> 00:30:08,281
But ever since you

752
00:30:08,402 --> 00:30:09,761
took over the tavern,

753
00:30:09,882 --> 00:30:11,481
you left the council

754
00:30:11,642 --> 00:30:13,241
and became completely money-driven.

755
00:30:13,682 --> 00:30:15,642
Look at yourself now.

756
00:30:15,761 --> 00:30:17,241
Are you worthy of his teachings?

757
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:18,001
Hold your tongue.

758
00:30:18,922 --> 00:30:19,882
Don't say

759
00:30:20,001 --> 00:30:21,842
such lofty remarks in front of me.

760
00:30:22,842 --> 00:30:24,281
You can defend
the Dragon Mountain Empire

761
00:30:24,402 --> 00:30:26,082
as you please.

762
00:30:26,721 --> 00:30:27,882
But what does it have to do with me?

763
00:30:28,001 --> 00:30:29,801
Today, even if I have to turn
your tavern upside down,

764
00:30:29,922 --> 00:30:31,642
I'll find that person.

765
00:30:31,761 --> 00:30:33,082
Who dares!

766
00:30:33,202 --> 00:30:34,321
See if I dare or not.

767
00:30:38,241 --> 00:30:38,882
Let's go.

768
00:31:30,922 --> 00:31:32,761
It seems you want me

769
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:33,761
to do it the hard way?

770
00:31:44,001 --> 00:31:44,682
Leave!

771
00:32:30,296 --> 00:32:31,512
(True Meaning of Swift Strike)

772
00:33:12,162 --> 00:33:13,082
How is it?

773
00:33:13,162 --> 00:33:14,402
Satisfied?

774
00:33:14,642 --> 00:33:16,001
You've searched.

775
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:17,442
Do you still want to fight?

776
00:33:17,842 --> 00:33:19,202
Well,

777
00:33:19,281 --> 00:33:20,202
maybe the two disciples

778
00:33:20,202 --> 00:33:21,001
made a mistake.

779
00:33:21,122 --> 00:33:23,642
Please forgive us, Master Ye.

780
00:33:24,001 --> 00:33:25,041
I won't see you off.

781
00:33:47,321 --> 00:33:48,442
Why did you help me?

782
00:33:48,561 --> 00:33:49,561
I never help

783
00:33:49,682 --> 00:33:51,241
anyone.

784
00:33:51,402 --> 00:33:52,362
Here,

785
00:33:52,481 --> 00:33:54,122
you have only one identity,

786
00:33:54,402 --> 00:33:55,642
an assassin.

787
00:33:55,801 --> 00:33:56,481
You truly are

788
00:33:56,481 --> 00:33:57,801
a heroine,

789
00:33:57,882 --> 00:33:59,001
with an unrestrained attitude.

790
00:33:59,602 --> 00:34:01,402
If one is useless,

791
00:34:01,561 --> 00:34:02,442
sooner or later they'll meet

792
00:34:02,561 --> 00:34:04,001
their end at the hands of another.

793
00:34:04,202 --> 00:34:05,882
I suggest you leave early

794
00:34:06,082 --> 00:34:07,281
so as not to let your dirty blood

795
00:34:07,402 --> 00:34:09,082
taint my tavern.

796
00:34:09,441 --> 00:34:10,401
(By now, the branches)

797
00:34:10,401 --> 00:34:11,721
(have been almost built,)

798
00:34:11,881 --> 00:34:13,522
(and she's seen through my identity,)

799
00:34:13,761 --> 00:34:15,441
(so there's no need for me
to stay here any longer.)

800
00:34:16,202 --> 00:34:17,002
Two days.

801
00:34:17,281 --> 00:34:18,881
Please give me two more days, Master Ye,

802
00:34:19,042 --> 00:34:20,602
and I'll leave

803
00:34:20,721 --> 00:34:21,721
without causing any trouble

804
00:34:21,721 --> 00:34:22,761
for your tavern.

805
00:34:26,202 --> 00:34:28,042
(I dodged a bullet today.)

806
00:34:28,562 --> 00:34:30,162
(They've already tracked me here.)

807
00:34:30,281 --> 00:34:31,721
(I need to speed up my action.)

808
00:34:32,042 --> 00:34:34,721
(Otherwise, the Demon Clan's plan...)

809
00:34:35,841 --> 00:34:36,841
(That man)

810
00:34:36,962 --> 00:34:38,682
(has ruined my plans several times)

811
00:34:38,801 --> 00:34:40,482
(after surviving
in the Destruction Mountain Range.)

812
00:34:40,682 --> 00:34:41,841
(Next time,)

813
00:34:42,082 --> 00:34:44,162
(I'll personally cut off his head.)

814
00:34:54,122 --> 00:34:54,881
Master.

815
00:34:56,482 --> 00:34:57,241
Master,

816
00:34:57,522 --> 00:34:58,881
I've finished my morning practice.

817
00:34:59,042 --> 00:34:59,522
Could you

818
00:34:59,522 --> 00:35:00,642
teach me a spell?

819
00:35:03,122 --> 00:35:03,841
It's been many years

820
00:35:03,841 --> 00:35:05,562
since someone cleaned my residence.

821
00:35:05,761 --> 00:35:07,002
As the saying goes,

822
00:35:07,122 --> 00:35:08,082
if one doesn't sweep their own house,

823
00:35:08,082 --> 00:35:09,281
how can they sweep the world?

824
00:35:09,361 --> 00:35:09,921
You just

825
00:35:09,921 --> 00:35:11,122
clean this place up thoroughly.

826
00:35:11,241 --> 00:35:12,321
Alright, master.

827
00:35:12,401 --> 00:35:13,682
As long as you teach me a spell,

828
00:35:13,801 --> 00:35:14,921
I do anything for you.

829
00:35:19,682 --> 00:35:20,921
Using this?

830
00:35:21,042 --> 00:35:22,042
Use this

831
00:35:22,162 --> 00:35:23,241
to clean up well.

832
00:35:41,921 --> 00:35:42,881
Master,

833
00:35:42,962 --> 00:35:44,241
can he do it?

834
00:35:44,321 --> 00:35:46,321
It depends on himself.

835
00:35:46,401 --> 00:35:47,562
If he can't,

836
00:35:48,122 --> 00:35:49,441
it means the lightning techniques

837
00:35:49,441 --> 00:35:50,841
aren't meant for him.

838
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:33,482
You're here.

839
00:36:34,202 --> 00:36:36,241
Yeah, I come to see you.

840
00:36:39,841 --> 00:36:40,401
The entrance exam for Changfeng Academy

841
00:36:40,482 --> 00:36:41,801
will be held tomorrow.

842
00:36:41,921 --> 00:36:43,321
Is everything ready?

843
00:36:43,441 --> 00:36:44,562
It's all ready.

844
00:36:44,841 --> 00:36:45,401
The exam for selecting talents

845
00:36:45,522 --> 00:36:47,082
for our empire

846
00:36:47,281 --> 00:36:48,801
must not have any issues.

847
00:36:49,642 --> 00:36:50,682
Changfeng Academy

848
00:36:50,801 --> 00:36:52,202
has taken all your efforts.

849
00:36:52,281 --> 00:36:53,562
It must be excellent.

850
00:36:55,562 --> 00:36:56,801
After preparing for so long,

851
00:36:56,962 --> 00:36:57,602
finally, there's a place

852
00:36:57,721 --> 00:36:59,241
to cultivate Transcendent talents.

853
00:36:59,921 --> 00:37:02,042
You've worked hard these days.

854
00:37:02,281 --> 00:37:03,841
No matter how hard it is, it's worth it.

855
00:37:04,522 --> 00:37:06,002
With Changfeng Academy,

856
00:37:06,162 --> 00:37:07,682
we can cultivate

857
00:37:07,801 --> 00:37:08,841
more outstanding reserve talents

858
00:37:08,841 --> 00:37:09,721
for our empire

859
00:37:10,042 --> 00:37:11,721
and make them stronger

860
00:37:12,441 --> 00:37:14,401
to better defend our empire.

861
00:37:14,962 --> 00:37:17,401
Then, I'll ask you to teach them.

862
00:37:17,682 --> 00:37:18,401
Alright.

863
00:37:18,921 --> 00:37:20,602
Not only will they
improve their martial arts,

864
00:37:20,801 --> 00:37:22,042
but they will also become

865
00:37:22,042 --> 00:37:24,002
kind and righteous.

866
00:37:24,562 --> 00:37:26,602
They must never bow to the Demon Clan.

867
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,162
I hope Changfeng Academy

868
00:37:36,962 --> 00:37:37,962
can cultivate more talents

869
00:37:37,962 --> 00:37:39,482
as a backup force

870
00:37:39,682 --> 00:37:40,562
against the Demon Clan

871
00:37:40,562 --> 00:37:41,522
for our empire.

872
00:37:41,921 --> 00:37:42,881
It certainly will.

873
00:37:43,881 --> 00:37:45,682
We've both been busy these days.

874
00:37:46,122 --> 00:37:47,162
I can only come here

875
00:37:47,162 --> 00:37:48,241
to rest for a while.

876
00:37:48,962 --> 00:37:50,281
Although you call it a rest

877
00:37:50,441 --> 00:37:52,042
you've been talking
about work all the time.

878
00:37:53,002 --> 00:37:53,841
Alright.

879
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:54,841
I won't talk about it anymore.

880
00:37:59,642 --> 00:38:00,841
Are you tired from making clothes?

881
00:38:02,441 --> 00:38:03,642
Do you want to rest for a while?

882
00:38:08,321 --> 00:38:09,401
The robe is finished.

883
00:38:09,522 --> 00:38:10,721
Try it on to see if it fits.

884
00:38:15,921 --> 00:38:18,321
The clothes you make fit me best

885
00:38:18,522 --> 00:38:19,921
and soothe me the most.

886
00:38:34,321 --> 00:38:35,682
I will protect the Fog City

887
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,642
with Xiaoxi.

888
00:38:38,241 --> 00:38:40,082
I'll protect

889
00:38:40,642 --> 00:38:42,841
the ordinary yet precious happiness
and peace.

890
00:38:43,992 --> 00:38:45,956
(Auspicious Clouds Room)

891
00:38:54,801 --> 00:38:56,441
You can sleep here tonight.

892
00:38:57,721 --> 00:38:58,562
Thank you.

893
00:38:59,401 --> 00:39:00,482
Rest early.

894
00:39:00,482 --> 00:39:01,361
I'm going back.

895
00:39:23,841 --> 00:39:24,522
(Be fast,)

896
00:39:25,202 --> 00:39:26,202
(even faster.)

897
00:39:26,801 --> 00:39:28,761
(No, it's Dou Qi.)

898
00:39:29,441 --> 00:39:30,801
(Fusing it as one)

899
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:32,361
(and bursting with speed and power.)

900
00:39:33,042 --> 00:39:34,122
(Be even faster.)

901
00:39:34,642 --> 00:39:36,321
(Filling muscles, bones)

902
00:39:36,482 --> 00:39:37,841
(and every inch
of the skin surface with Dou Qi.)

903
00:39:38,441 --> 00:39:39,801
(My Dou Qi is breathing.)

904
00:39:48,482 --> 00:39:51,281
Why do my masters and seniors

905
00:39:51,441 --> 00:39:52,642
all make great progress

906
00:39:53,241 --> 00:39:54,721
but after practicing for many years,

907
00:39:55,241 --> 00:39:57,042
I still can't break through?

908
00:40:00,962 --> 00:40:01,721
Miss Yu.

909
00:40:03,482 --> 00:40:04,841
You're not asleep yet?

910
00:40:09,801 --> 00:40:11,042
I can't sleep.

911
00:40:11,761 --> 00:40:13,002
Today after seeing the wonderful battle

912
00:40:13,002 --> 00:40:13,841
of the elders

913
00:40:13,841 --> 00:40:14,562
at the Bloodshed Tavern,

914
00:40:14,562 --> 00:40:15,482
I got anxious.

915
00:40:16,761 --> 00:40:17,801
When will I

916
00:40:17,921 --> 00:40:19,082
step into the Transcendent realm?

917
00:40:20,841 --> 00:40:22,962
It isn't easy at all.

918
00:40:23,522 --> 00:40:25,441
I've practiced for many years
and still haven't made a breakthrough.

919
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:27,841
I hope after entering Changfeng Academy,

920
00:40:27,962 --> 00:40:29,642
I'll have some improvements.

921
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,122
I've heard

922
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:34,441
that Changfeng Academy has cultivated

923
00:40:34,441 --> 00:40:35,921
many Transcendent cultivators.

924
00:40:36,202 --> 00:40:37,602
With diligent practice

925
00:40:37,682 --> 00:40:40,122
and guidance from Knight Changfeng,

926
00:40:40,241 --> 00:40:41,522
I believe my speed, strength and Dou Qi

927
00:40:41,522 --> 00:40:42,841
will continually improve

928
00:40:42,962 --> 00:40:44,921
and that I'll get closer and closer
to the Transcendent realm.

929
00:40:45,321 --> 00:40:46,602
Becoming Transcendent

930
00:40:46,682 --> 00:40:47,841
isn't about how high

931
00:40:47,841 --> 00:40:48,602
your cultivation level is,

932
00:40:48,761 --> 00:40:49,522
but...

933
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,002
Why are you looking at me?

934
00:40:55,401 --> 00:40:57,962
I'm listening to your lecture.

935
00:40:59,721 --> 00:41:00,921
So,

936
00:41:01,401 --> 00:41:03,241
to have a breakthrough,

937
00:41:03,321 --> 00:41:05,082
you must grasp the mysteries of nature

938
00:41:05,202 --> 00:41:06,642
and comprehend the power
of heaven and earth.

939
00:41:12,962 --> 00:41:13,761
Mother,

940
00:41:14,162 --> 00:41:15,642
are you a Transcendent Knight?

941
00:41:19,082 --> 00:41:20,441
No, I'm not.

942
00:41:20,642 --> 00:41:22,482
The method was recorded in this book.

943
00:41:22,602 --> 00:41:23,522
If you follow it,

944
00:41:23,682 --> 00:41:25,361
won't you become Transcendent?

945
00:41:27,721 --> 00:41:28,602
Xueying,

946
00:41:29,482 --> 00:41:30,522
each person's path

947
00:41:30,522 --> 00:41:32,042
to being Transcendent

948
00:41:32,162 --> 00:41:33,482
is different.

949
00:41:33,642 --> 00:41:35,002
You can learn and draw on

950
00:41:35,082 --> 00:41:36,841
the experiences of others,

951
00:41:36,962 --> 00:41:38,361
but you can't

952
00:41:38,361 --> 00:41:39,522
blindly imitate them.

953
00:41:40,202 --> 00:41:42,042
To become a Transcendent Knight,

954
00:41:42,202 --> 00:41:43,682
you have to rely on yourself.

955
00:41:44,122 --> 00:41:45,841
You have to rely on your own strength

956
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,721
to comprehend
the power of heaven and earth.

957
00:41:47,881 --> 00:41:49,562
That's how you'll make a breakthrough.

958
00:41:49,682 --> 00:41:50,522
Do you understand?

959
00:41:51,602 --> 00:41:53,721
Take a look at this.

960
00:41:55,841 --> 00:41:56,921
What's wrong?

961
00:41:59,401 --> 00:42:00,602
You're right.

962
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:02,122
My mother said

963
00:42:02,401 --> 00:42:03,801
one must understand
the power of heaven and earth

964
00:42:03,881 --> 00:42:05,482
to become a Transcendent Knight.

965
00:42:06,241 --> 00:42:08,002
If I could have comprehended it earlier,

966
00:42:08,921 --> 00:42:10,441
my father wouldn't have died,

967
00:42:10,921 --> 00:42:12,321
and my mother
wouldn't have been taken away.

968
00:42:13,721 --> 00:42:15,082
At least you know your mother

969
00:42:15,082 --> 00:42:16,642
is waiting for you far away,

970
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:19,002
while I

971
00:42:19,962 --> 00:42:21,122
don't even know

972
00:42:21,122 --> 00:42:21,921
where my parents are.

973
00:42:26,721 --> 00:42:27,602
I'm sorry.

974
00:42:28,562 --> 00:42:29,321
It's okay.

975
00:42:30,441 --> 00:42:31,841
I've gotten used to it.

976
00:42:32,002 --> 00:42:33,042
Actually, over the years,

977
00:42:33,122 --> 00:42:34,202
I've been living quite well.

978
00:42:36,162 --> 00:42:37,482
Don't give up.

979
00:42:38,042 --> 00:42:39,441
You'll definitely be reunited.

980
00:42:40,682 --> 00:42:42,202
Will I ever find my parents?

981
00:42:42,321 --> 00:42:43,042
Of course.

982
00:42:43,522 --> 00:42:44,921
If you need my help,

983
00:42:45,281 --> 00:42:46,522
just tell me.

984
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:48,682
Thank you.
