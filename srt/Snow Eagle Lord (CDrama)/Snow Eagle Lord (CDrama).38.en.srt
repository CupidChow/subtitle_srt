I am staying here.

I want to be with you forever.

00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:52,630
No.

25
00:01:53,511 --> 00:01:54,511
You must go back.

26
00:01:54,511 --> 00:01:55,511
I don't want you to get hurt.

27
00:01:56,031 --> 00:01:57,430
I've found a way.

28
00:01:57,671 --> 00:01:59,630
I can stay
in Dragon Mountain Empire for long.

29
00:02:00,190 --> 00:02:00,951
Really?

30
00:02:01,350 --> 00:02:02,270
What is it?

31
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:39,951
What happened to your hand?

32
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:46,391
There might be a way

33
00:02:46,511 --> 00:02:47,391
to solve the Witch Poison
Xueying poisoned.

34
00:02:47,391 --> 00:02:48,671
You can have a try.

35
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,071
Then tell me.

36
00:02:51,191 --> 00:02:52,191
What's it?

37
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:53,830
God's Punishment Mountain.

38
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,111
Bitter Hundred Times.

39
00:02:57,830 --> 00:02:58,990
It's a secret of the Divine Realm.

40
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,391
I can't tell you.

41
00:03:07,231 --> 00:03:08,391
(I can't let Xueying know)

42
00:03:08,391 --> 00:03:10,150
(I was injured
in God's Punishment Mountain.)

43
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:11,911
(He would blame himself.)

44
00:03:12,631 --> 00:03:13,471
(For him,)

45
00:03:14,391 --> 00:03:16,111
(all of this is worth it.)

46
00:03:22,550 --> 00:03:24,430
Are your feet injured too?

47
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:27,030
I'm fine.

48
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:28,511
I'll recover soon.

49
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:29,430
Don't believe me? I'll show you.

50
00:03:34,710 --> 00:03:35,631
I think your injury is

51
00:03:35,631 --> 00:03:36,870
no lighter than Xueying's.

52
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,071
Let me hold you back and rest.

53
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,631
Thank you, Youyue.

54
00:03:43,631 --> 00:03:44,550
In the past,

55
00:03:44,671 --> 00:03:46,550
you were the one
who took me everywhere.

56
00:03:46,671 --> 00:03:47,511
Now,

57
00:03:47,631 --> 00:03:49,310
I'll be your crutch.

58
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,590
Alright.

59
00:03:53,231 --> 00:03:54,310
Miss Crutch,

60
00:03:55,391 --> 00:03:56,030
I won't let go of you

61
00:03:56,030 --> 00:03:57,191
from now on.

62
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:11,750
Master.

63
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,310
Master.

64
00:04:18,231 --> 00:04:19,190
I'm sorry.

65
00:04:19,870 --> 00:04:21,070
It's all my fault.

66
00:04:21,390 --> 00:04:22,791
I'm the one who got you into this.

67
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:24,471
Silly child,

68
00:04:26,111 --> 00:04:27,791
how can I blame you?

69
00:04:30,390 --> 00:04:31,630
I am not dead yet.

70
00:04:31,630 --> 00:04:32,550
Why are you crying?

71
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:38,310
I can rest easy now

72
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:40,510
that I've seen you

73
00:04:42,070 --> 00:04:43,430
before I go.

74
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:48,471
Chi Qiubai.

75
00:04:50,711 --> 00:04:51,831
Don't blame him.

76
00:04:53,151 --> 00:04:54,070
Rong,

77
00:04:55,190 --> 00:04:56,430
don't blame yourself either.

78
00:04:57,031 --> 00:04:58,111
If you have to blame,

79
00:04:59,630 --> 00:05:02,070
blame this incurable demonic poison.

80
00:05:02,990 --> 00:05:04,151
These years,

81
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:07,031
I've been suffering from it.

82
00:05:07,671 --> 00:05:09,711
I would rather die than live.

83
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:12,070
But now,

84
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,990
it's time

85
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:15,430
for me to be relieved.

86
00:05:16,831 --> 00:05:17,750
Master,

87
00:05:18,510 --> 00:05:20,950
in this world, besides you,

88
00:05:21,791 --> 00:05:23,870
no other human deserves to live.

89
00:05:24,711 --> 00:05:25,950
Don't say that.

90
00:05:29,990 --> 00:05:31,550
Rong, listen to me.

91
00:05:32,271 --> 00:05:33,791
Actually, all these years,

92
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:38,070
I lived the same life as yours.

93
00:05:39,031 --> 00:05:41,070
Do you know why?

94
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:43,791
Because for over twenty years,

95
00:05:44,351 --> 00:05:45,271
I have had to

96
00:05:45,390 --> 00:05:46,870
endure the demonic poison

97
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:50,310
that brought me extreme pain every day.

98
00:05:51,351 --> 00:05:52,351
The pain is

99
00:05:53,070 --> 00:05:54,671
not only physical

100
00:05:55,351 --> 00:05:57,231
but also mental torment.

101
00:05:58,111 --> 00:06:00,031
So I understand you best.

102
00:06:00,911 --> 00:06:02,630
Because I'm like you.

103
00:06:03,671 --> 00:06:05,950
I don't want to be despised by others.

104
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:15,591
Master, your demonic poison is gone.

105
00:06:27,591 --> 00:06:28,750
Master,

106
00:06:29,390 --> 00:06:30,950
you cut off your pulse

107
00:06:31,111 --> 00:06:32,591
to get rid of the demonic poison?

108
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:36,271
Rong,

109
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:38,031
now,

110
00:06:38,510 --> 00:06:40,950
I have done everything I need to do.

111
00:06:41,711 --> 00:06:42,831
It's time to go.

112
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:46,791
Since I am going,

113
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:48,111
do you think I should

114
00:06:48,111 --> 00:06:49,471
leave cleanly,

115
00:06:49,831 --> 00:06:51,111
or leave with

116
00:06:51,471 --> 00:06:53,351
the mark of the demonic poison?

117
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:55,831
You should be happy for me.

118
00:06:58,310 --> 00:06:59,711
But silly child,

119
00:07:01,591 --> 00:07:02,911
in this world,

120
00:07:05,070 --> 00:07:06,870
the only thing I can't let go of

121
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:09,630
is you.

122
00:07:10,271 --> 00:07:11,151
Regardless of

123
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,750
the fact that humans and demons
can't live with each other,

124
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:16,711
you still have me.

125
00:07:18,711 --> 00:07:19,471
Because I,

126
00:07:19,471 --> 00:07:21,070
from the first day I saw you,

127
00:07:22,111 --> 00:07:24,310
considered you my child.

128
00:07:25,591 --> 00:07:27,310
But for the road ahead,

129
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:29,351
you have to walk it alone.

130
00:07:32,151 --> 00:07:33,430
In this world,

131
00:07:33,831 --> 00:07:35,430
I can't go back anymore.

132
00:07:37,310 --> 00:07:38,831
You can.

133
00:07:39,831 --> 00:07:42,471
No matter how difficult
the road ahead is,

134
00:07:43,430 --> 00:07:45,111
you have to keep going.

135
00:07:46,070 --> 00:07:47,950
You're not walking alone.

136
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:49,990
You're walking for me.

137
00:07:52,510 --> 00:07:54,351
Live a good life as a human.

138
00:07:56,111 --> 00:07:58,111
Live under the sun.

139
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:02,750
Master.

140
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:08,950
Master.

141
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,911
Master!

142
00:08:11,791 --> 00:08:13,911
Master!

143
00:08:44,551 --> 00:08:45,831
It's from the Demon Clan.

144
00:08:52,030 --> 00:08:52,790
Qingshi,

145
00:08:52,831 --> 00:08:53,990
how do you like my embroidery?

146
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:58,071
It is really good.

147
00:08:58,351 --> 00:08:59,030
Rong,

148
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,351
you are really skilled.

149
00:09:00,591 --> 00:09:01,551
Of course,

150
00:09:01,670 --> 00:09:03,630
it is my favorite pattern.

151
00:09:07,071 --> 00:09:08,431
It's Ji Rong.

152
00:09:08,591 --> 00:09:09,551
I remember you mentioned

153
00:09:09,551 --> 00:09:10,711
in Xueying territory

154
00:09:10,910 --> 00:09:12,670
that you loved
this osmanthus cake the most.

155
00:09:15,311 --> 00:09:16,790
What is this big stuff?

156
00:09:16,870 --> 00:09:17,870
This is called Heixuan Machine.

157
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:18,790
The Black Iron Orders issued

158
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:20,111
by our Dragon Mountain Mansion

159
00:09:20,270 --> 00:09:21,311
will spread to every corner

160
00:09:21,311 --> 00:09:22,231
of Dragon Mountain Empire.

161
00:10:01,111 --> 00:10:02,191
Where did you go?

162
00:10:04,231 --> 00:10:06,030
I just went out to buy something

163
00:10:06,191 --> 00:10:07,591
and I ran into a demon on the way,

164
00:10:07,591 --> 00:10:08,510
so I got injured.

165
00:10:08,670 --> 00:10:10,111
Do you think I am

166
00:10:10,431 --> 00:10:12,191
the silliest person

167
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:14,750
and most easily deceived person
in this world?

168
00:10:17,551 --> 00:10:19,870
Qingshi, let me explain.

169
00:10:22,270 --> 00:10:23,630
What else do you want to explain?

170
00:10:24,191 --> 00:10:25,711
Explain how you added the Soporific Sap

171
00:10:25,711 --> 00:10:26,750
to the osmanthus cake?

172
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:28,071
Or explain

173
00:10:29,311 --> 00:10:31,390
how you demonized the Heixuan Machine?

174
00:10:37,311 --> 00:10:38,790
Rong,

175
00:10:40,111 --> 00:10:41,390
I loved you so much.

176
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:43,990
All this time,

177
00:10:45,071 --> 00:10:46,910
I have been
unconditionally protecting you.

178
00:10:47,591 --> 00:10:49,431
But I really didn't think...

179
00:10:50,551 --> 00:10:52,071
Really didn't think

180
00:10:53,311 --> 00:10:55,030
you'd been using me all along.

181
00:10:57,390 --> 00:10:58,431
Have you ever

182
00:10:58,431 --> 00:10:59,711
been sincere towards me?

183
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,431
Sincerity.

184
00:11:08,270 --> 00:11:09,510
Sincerity is the most useless thing

185
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,711
in this world.

186
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:11,951
What do you really want?

187
00:11:12,670 --> 00:11:14,630
I want the revival of the Demon Clan.

188
00:11:15,471 --> 00:11:16,551
Why?

189
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:18,951
Only with the revival of the Demon Clan,

190
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:19,831
can I return to

191
00:11:19,831 --> 00:11:20,990
the home that belongs to me.

192
00:11:21,111 --> 00:11:23,030
Does the Demon Clan
really treat you well?

193
00:11:23,831 --> 00:11:25,431
Can the Demon Clan really trust you?

194
00:11:25,431 --> 00:11:26,390
Do you think you humans

195
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:27,670
would trust me?

196
00:11:27,951 --> 00:11:28,471
You would only hate me

197
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,750
for being a half-demon,
half-human monster.

198
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,030
Everyone despises me.

199
00:11:32,231 --> 00:11:34,711
I just want to find my value.

200
00:11:35,030 --> 00:11:36,071
What are you saying?

201
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:39,591
Because I believed in you,

202
00:11:40,711 --> 00:11:42,390
Uncle Tong San died.

203
00:11:43,390 --> 00:11:44,750
Because I believed in you,

204
00:11:45,591 --> 00:11:46,591
Uncle Zong Ling,

205
00:11:46,990 --> 00:11:48,551
in order to
cure my deep demonic poison,

206
00:11:48,551 --> 00:11:49,591
died too.

207
00:11:50,551 --> 00:11:52,111
You caused chaos
in the Dragon Mountain Mansion

208
00:11:52,510 --> 00:11:54,630
and killed so many innocent people.

209
00:11:56,630 --> 00:11:58,351
I can't face my parents

210
00:11:59,231 --> 00:12:00,711
and my brother.

211
00:12:02,311 --> 00:12:03,311
Today,

212
00:12:04,191 --> 00:12:05,990
you must pay the price!

213
00:12:08,750 --> 00:12:09,750
Qingshi!

214
00:12:09,750 --> 00:12:10,990
The biggest mistake

215
00:12:11,390 --> 00:12:12,910
I made in my life

216
00:12:13,790 --> 00:12:15,111
is falling in love with you.

217
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:28,270
(Rong,)

218
00:13:28,670 --> 00:13:29,591
(I don't care about)

219
00:13:29,591 --> 00:13:30,431
(your background.)

220
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,431
(During my hardest days,)

221
00:13:32,551 --> 00:13:33,951
(you were always by my side.)

222
00:13:34,150 --> 00:13:35,431
So in the future,

223
00:13:35,790 --> 00:13:37,431
I will always be by your side.

224
00:13:50,150 --> 00:13:51,510
(It's my fault.)

225
00:13:52,351 --> 00:13:54,191
(I disappointed everyone.)

Why did you still save me?

234
00:14:51,591 --> 00:14:54,390
If I died,
I wouldn't have to lie anymore.

238

and I've let you down.

239
00:15:07,951 --> 00:15:10,351
From birth, I've been despised.

240
00:15:11,551 --> 00:15:13,670
Even as a human, I'm not respected.

241
00:15:16,231 --> 00:15:17,630
Even joining the Demon Clan,

242
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:20,071
I was not fully trusted by them.

243
00:15:20,711 --> 00:15:21,990
I'm not human,

244
00:15:22,150 --> 00:15:23,390
nor am I a demon.

245
00:15:25,351 --> 00:15:27,790
When I was being chosen by the two,

246
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,390
only you,

247
00:15:31,630 --> 00:15:32,670
from the moment we met,

248
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:34,270
chose to believe in me,

249
00:15:35,390 --> 00:15:36,390
even after knowing my identity,

250
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,750
you didn't despise me.

251
00:15:38,990 --> 00:15:39,990
Qingshi,

252
00:15:41,390 --> 00:15:42,551
I'm sorry.

253
00:15:45,831 --> 00:15:48,111
If I could do it all over again,

254
00:15:52,390 --> 00:15:54,551
I wouldn't make the same choices.

255
00:15:55,591 --> 00:15:56,831
As long as you're willing,

256
00:15:58,111 --> 00:15:59,990
there's still time to make things right.

257
00:16:04,231 --> 00:16:06,191
Will you really forgive me?

258
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:08,071
Will they

259
00:16:10,591 --> 00:16:12,510
forgive me?

260
00:16:16,750 --> 00:16:17,551
Yes.

261
00:16:18,551 --> 00:16:20,030
As long as you truly repent.

262
00:16:22,518 --> 00:16:30,534
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

263
00:16:31,951 --> 00:16:33,270
Chi Qiubai,

264
00:16:33,750 --> 00:16:35,311
you dare to come back.

265
00:16:35,711 --> 00:16:37,551
Do you think you're a savior

266
00:16:37,591 --> 00:16:38,951
because you broke
the Witch God Sword Formation

267
00:16:39,111 --> 00:16:40,591
and released Dongbo Xueying?

268
00:16:41,030 --> 00:16:42,551
The Witch God Sword still obtained

269
00:16:42,551 --> 00:16:43,831
Dongbo Xueying's blood.

270
00:16:43,951 --> 00:16:46,111
He's already been poisoned by
Witch Poison of Ghost Six Resentment.

271
00:16:46,231 --> 00:16:47,311
In front of him,

272
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:48,711
he can't choose anything but die.

273
00:16:48,910 --> 00:16:50,551
Xueying has been poisoned
by Witch Poison.

274
00:16:51,471 --> 00:16:53,711
He will pose no threat
to the Demon Clan.

275
00:16:53,870 --> 00:16:54,510
Do you know

276
00:16:54,510 --> 00:16:56,150
the consequences of
betraying Demon Clan?

277
00:16:57,111 --> 00:16:58,630
Dongbo Xueying is my disciple.

278
00:16:59,351 --> 00:17:00,750
Letting me watch him die,

279
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:02,390
I truly can't bear it.

280
00:17:05,470 --> 00:17:06,710
How is Xinhuo Palace now?

281
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:09,791
The civilians now

282
00:17:09,791 --> 00:17:11,111
don't believe in Xinhuo Palace at all.

283
00:17:12,591 --> 00:17:14,031
The six Elders are either

284
00:17:14,150 --> 00:17:15,071
dead or scattered.

285
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:16,670
Now Xinhuo Palace

286
00:17:17,230 --> 00:17:18,470
is just an empty shell.

287
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,991
The disciple of the Sea God Palace

288
00:17:19,991 --> 00:17:21,511
who is close to me told me

289
00:17:21,630 --> 00:17:22,910
he wants to retire to the forest,

290
00:17:23,271 --> 00:17:24,351
no longer caring about the world.

291
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,230
Xueying,

292
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,430
you'd better make plans
as early as possible.

293
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:29,831
Do another thing

294
00:17:30,071 --> 00:17:31,351
in the future.

295
00:17:34,551 --> 00:17:35,230
Alright.

296
00:17:35,870 --> 00:17:37,150
Let's leave him alone.

297
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,271
Xueying, have a good rest.

298
00:18:04,791 --> 00:18:05,591
(Perhaps,)

299
00:18:06,111 --> 00:18:08,031
(I am just like this small candle,)

300
00:18:08,591 --> 00:18:10,071
(being blown out as the wind passes.)

301
00:18:11,470 --> 00:18:13,630
(Can I really light up
thousands of candles)

302
00:18:14,430 --> 00:18:16,271
(and guard
Dragon Mountain Empire together?)

303
00:18:17,710 --> 00:18:19,031
(By myself,)

304
00:18:20,230 --> 00:18:22,031
(can I really save the Xia Clan?)

305
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,791
Save me.

306
00:18:30,991 --> 00:18:32,511
Help me.

307
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:34,230
Help me.

308
00:18:34,511 --> 00:18:36,390
Sir, I will give you candy.

309
00:18:36,551 --> 00:18:37,910
Every time I fall,

310
00:18:37,950 --> 00:18:39,991
my mother will give me candy.

311
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,430
When I eat candy,

312
00:18:41,551 --> 00:18:42,710
it won't hurt anymore.

313
00:18:42,991 --> 00:18:44,751
Thank you, little boy.

314
00:18:45,870 --> 00:18:46,630
Every time I leave you for a while,

315
00:18:46,630 --> 00:18:47,430
you will run around.

316
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:48,351
The world is so chaotic.

317
00:18:48,351 --> 00:18:49,630
What if you're caught by the Demon Clan?

318
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:50,591
Mother,

319
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:52,470
he is not a demon.

320
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:53,591
He is just

321
00:18:53,591 --> 00:18:55,430
a pitiful old man.

322
00:18:55,870 --> 00:18:57,511
Who knows
if he is a demonized Xia Clan person

323
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:58,430
or a demon disguised

324
00:18:58,430 --> 00:18:59,511
as a Xia Clan person.

325
00:18:59,511 --> 00:19:00,351
Sir,

326
00:19:00,511 --> 00:19:01,591
I advise you not to

327
00:19:01,591 --> 00:19:02,470
run around outside.

328
00:19:02,950 --> 00:19:04,351
Now that the Demon Clan is rampant,

329
00:19:04,511 --> 00:19:05,991
the righteous can't even
protect themselves.

330
00:19:06,190 --> 00:19:06,710
Let alone someone comes to

331
00:19:06,710 --> 00:19:07,991
take care of us.

332
00:19:09,351 --> 00:19:10,791
Sir, come on.

333
00:19:10,910 --> 00:19:11,791
Let me help you up.

334
00:19:12,111 --> 00:19:13,111
Qingshi.

335
00:19:13,551 --> 00:19:14,630
Come on. Have a seat, Sir.

336
00:19:16,831 --> 00:19:18,311
Sir, where are you going?

337
00:19:18,470 --> 00:19:19,311
I will take you there.

338
00:19:19,751 --> 00:19:21,430
I am alone and helpless,

339
00:19:21,551 --> 00:19:22,670
with no one to rely on.

340
00:19:22,831 --> 00:19:24,071
I just want to find a place

341
00:19:24,071 --> 00:19:25,991
where I can settle down.

342
00:19:26,150 --> 00:19:26,991
Our Dragon Mountain Mansion

343
00:19:27,111 --> 00:19:28,470
just established a charity hall,

344
00:19:28,670 --> 00:19:29,430
specifically to accommodate

345
00:19:29,430 --> 00:19:30,351
homeless people.

346
00:19:30,511 --> 00:19:31,150
Later on,

347
00:19:31,311 --> 00:19:32,430
I will take you there.

348
00:19:32,551 --> 00:19:33,950
Thank you, young master.

349
00:19:34,111 --> 00:19:35,470
Thank you, young master.

350
00:19:36,511 --> 00:19:37,230
Let's go.

351
00:19:37,351 --> 00:19:37,950
Wait.

352
00:19:42,430 --> 00:19:43,591
This is our Dragon Mountain Mansion's

353
00:19:43,791 --> 00:19:44,950
newly developed Exorcising Powder.

354
00:19:45,111 --> 00:19:47,190
Although it can't kill demons yet,

355
00:19:47,390 --> 00:19:47,910
it's enough to

356
00:19:47,910 --> 00:19:48,910
delay them for a while

357
00:19:48,991 --> 00:19:49,670
to buy you

358
00:19:49,670 --> 00:19:50,791
time to escape.

359
00:19:50,991 --> 00:19:51,591
Here.

360
00:19:55,031 --> 00:19:56,351
You're from Dragon Mountain Mansion?

361
00:19:57,071 --> 00:19:58,311
So young.

362
00:19:58,591 --> 00:20:00,271
Is it a new trick of the Demon Clan?

363
00:20:00,311 --> 00:20:01,910
I am the new owner of
Dragon Mountain Mansion,

364
00:20:02,031 --> 00:20:02,991
Dongbo Qingshi.

365
00:20:03,311 --> 00:20:04,271
Please rest assured.

366
00:20:04,470 --> 00:20:05,910
As long as
Dragon Mountain Mansion exists,

367
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:07,351
we will always be the strongest support

368
00:20:07,351 --> 00:20:08,511
and most loyal protector

369
00:20:08,511 --> 00:20:09,870
of the Xia Clan.

370
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:11,390
You can't even save yourself.

371
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,630
How can you protect us?

372
00:20:14,150 --> 00:20:15,630
Give us a little more time.

373
00:20:16,271 --> 00:20:17,150
Big brother,

374
00:20:17,190 --> 00:20:18,670
I believe in you.

375
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:21,111
You can definitely
drive away the bad guys.

376
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:25,991
Good boy.

377
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,390
Qingshi.

378
00:20:37,710 --> 00:20:38,390
Brother,

379
00:20:39,591 --> 00:20:40,591
why are you here?

380
00:20:41,150 --> 00:20:42,390
Let me help you.

381
00:20:43,430 --> 00:20:43,950
Okay.

382
00:20:54,591 --> 00:20:55,311
I'll help you.

383
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:56,591
Take your time.

384
00:20:58,271 --> 00:20:59,150
Take it easy.

385
00:20:59,630 --> 00:21:00,271
Brother.

386
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:02,190
Lord.

387
00:21:02,591 --> 00:21:04,071
Take him

388
00:21:04,111 --> 00:21:04,910
for resettlement.

389
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:05,910
Lord,

390
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,630
it's not that
we don't want to accept him.

391
00:21:07,831 --> 00:21:08,950
But there are no vacancies

392
00:21:09,150 --> 00:21:10,390
in the charity hall now.

393
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:16,071
Sir,

394
00:21:16,870 --> 00:21:17,630
please sit here.

395
00:21:22,910 --> 00:21:24,551
I am the new owner
of Dragon Mountain Mansion,

396
00:21:24,791 --> 00:21:25,710
Dongbo Qingshi.

397
00:21:26,071 --> 00:21:27,430
We want to make the charity hall

398
00:21:27,591 --> 00:21:28,390
more complete,

399
00:21:28,551 --> 00:21:29,430
and more effective,

400
00:21:29,870 --> 00:21:31,670
maximizing its function.

401
00:21:32,271 --> 00:21:33,831
Now, people with light injuries,

402
00:21:34,031 --> 00:21:34,950
please stand in the middle.

403
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:36,751
People who are not injured

404
00:21:36,950 --> 00:21:38,111
but are hungry,

405
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:39,390
please stand on our right.

406
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:41,150
The rest of the people
with severe injuries,

407
00:21:41,150 --> 00:21:42,111
you could lie down.

408
00:21:42,511 --> 00:21:43,271
You guys,

409
00:21:43,591 --> 00:21:44,910
you are in charge of
the people on the right.

410
00:21:44,950 --> 00:21:45,710
Yes.

411
00:21:46,430 --> 00:21:47,111
You guys

412
00:21:47,551 --> 00:21:48,430
are in charge of the middle.

413
00:21:48,430 --> 00:21:49,190
Yes.

414
00:21:49,351 --> 00:21:50,150
The rest of you.

415
00:21:50,311 --> 00:21:51,190
Go with me.

416
00:21:51,351 --> 00:21:52,630
Take care of
the severely injured people.

417
00:21:53,031 --> 00:21:54,150
Everyone, take action.

418
00:21:54,311 --> 00:21:55,870
Yes.

419
00:22:01,670 --> 00:22:02,991
Kind and righteous.

420
00:22:03,190 --> 00:22:04,470
Brave and resourceful.

421
00:22:04,670 --> 00:22:06,351
What a good kid.

422
00:22:06,791 --> 00:22:08,190
My grandson

423
00:22:08,511 --> 00:22:10,031
is about his age.

424
00:22:10,230 --> 00:22:11,950
Unfortunately, he...

425
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:15,831
Sir, my condolence.

426
00:22:26,991 --> 00:22:27,710
Hold on.

427
00:22:34,470 --> 00:22:35,150
Feeling better?

428
00:22:35,430 --> 00:22:36,910
Mother, take me there.

429
00:22:40,551 --> 00:22:41,190
Brother.

430
00:22:42,630 --> 00:22:43,430
Qingshi,

431
00:22:43,710 --> 00:22:44,870
you've grown up now.

432
00:22:45,031 --> 00:22:45,710
You are able to handle

433
00:22:45,710 --> 00:22:46,910
so much on your own.

434
00:22:48,111 --> 00:22:49,910
Brother, you can't lose to me.

435
00:22:50,591 --> 00:22:51,710
You need to recover quickly

436
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,190
and get back on your feet.

437
00:22:55,271 --> 00:22:56,991
I used to take care of you.

438
00:22:57,470 --> 00:22:58,311
Now,

439
00:22:59,271 --> 00:23:00,111
I didn't expect

440
00:23:00,311 --> 00:23:01,630
you need to cheer me on.

441
00:23:01,670 --> 00:23:02,430
When we were children, our father

442
00:23:02,430 --> 00:23:03,591
always told us

443
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:05,390
that the purpose of cultivation

444
00:23:05,551 --> 00:23:07,230
is not just to improve martial arts

445
00:23:07,470 --> 00:23:08,390
and protect ourselves

446
00:23:09,630 --> 00:23:11,111
but also to protect others.

447
00:23:11,511 --> 00:23:13,150
To protect everyone around us.

448
00:23:14,230 --> 00:23:15,670
I didn't understand it at that time,

449
00:23:16,031 --> 00:23:17,271
but now,

450
00:23:17,870 --> 00:23:18,831
after all the numerous hardships

451
00:23:18,831 --> 00:23:19,870
we've been through,

452
00:23:20,311 --> 00:23:21,710
even life and death,

453
00:23:23,190 --> 00:23:24,311
I finally understand

454
00:23:24,831 --> 00:23:26,071
the meaning of responsibility.

455
00:23:26,470 --> 00:23:27,390
Responsibility.

456
00:23:27,870 --> 00:23:29,190
For some people, their responsibility

457
00:23:29,351 --> 00:23:30,551
is to live

458
00:23:30,551 --> 00:23:31,430
a peaceful and comfortable life

459
00:23:31,551 --> 00:23:32,991
and bring happiness to others.

460
00:23:33,630 --> 00:23:35,031
But for others, their responsibility

461
00:23:35,630 --> 00:23:37,031
is to endure hardships

462
00:23:37,551 --> 00:23:38,950
and overcome numerous challenges.

463
00:23:41,071 --> 00:23:41,710
Brother,

464
00:23:42,311 --> 00:23:43,430
in my heart,

465
00:23:44,111 --> 00:23:45,991
you are destined to be a hero.

466
00:23:49,630 --> 00:23:50,430
Now I'm just

467
00:23:50,430 --> 00:23:51,991
an ordinary person who's been injured.

468
00:23:52,710 --> 00:23:53,710
Every hero,

469
00:23:53,870 --> 00:23:55,311
before becoming a hero,

470
00:23:55,630 --> 00:23:56,870
is an ordinary person.

471
00:24:06,551 --> 00:24:07,551
You need to believe

472
00:24:08,470 --> 00:24:09,591
that above despair,

473
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:10,870
there is always hope.

474
00:24:11,271 --> 00:24:12,470
Look at all these people,

475
00:24:13,150 --> 00:24:14,430
they didn't run away.

476
00:24:15,111 --> 00:24:16,710
How can we run away?

477
00:24:18,031 --> 00:24:19,430
Whether it's the Dragon Mountain Empire

478
00:24:19,910 --> 00:24:20,991
or you, my brother,

479
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,071
we must never give up.

480
00:24:45,791 --> 00:24:47,910
Xueying, what are you thinking about?

481
00:24:49,950 --> 00:24:51,190
Look at these falling leaves.

482
00:24:52,230 --> 00:24:53,670
Whenever the fierce wind blows,

483
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,630
they fall along with it.

484
00:24:56,511 --> 00:24:57,630
They too are struggling to

485
00:24:57,630 --> 00:24:58,831
fight against the autumn wind.

486
00:24:59,511 --> 00:25:01,351
In the air,

487
00:25:01,710 --> 00:25:03,470
they are more like riding the wind

488
00:25:03,630 --> 00:25:04,791
and dancing with the wind.

489
00:25:05,791 --> 00:25:07,710
The spirit is willing,
but the flesh is weak.

490
00:25:10,910 --> 00:25:12,111
It doesn't sound like you.

491
00:25:13,511 --> 00:25:15,031
Then what should I be like?

492
00:25:15,870 --> 00:25:17,230
You're always brave

493
00:25:17,430 --> 00:25:18,670
and move forward without hesitation.

494
00:25:19,311 --> 00:25:20,791
When you encountered Ge Bin,

495
00:25:20,950 --> 00:25:22,630
even with the disparity
in martial arts skills,

496
00:25:22,630 --> 00:25:23,870
you didn't give up.

497
00:25:24,551 --> 00:25:26,031
You're always resilient.

498
00:25:26,470 --> 00:25:28,351
During the Changfeng Academy exams,

499
00:25:28,470 --> 00:25:30,111
everyone else couldn't hold on

500
00:25:30,111 --> 00:25:31,111
and gave up one after another.

501
00:25:31,311 --> 00:25:32,150
Only you,

502
00:25:32,551 --> 00:25:34,150
relying on your strong will,

503
00:25:34,150 --> 00:25:35,150
held on till the end.

504
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:37,831
But now I'm poisoned.

505
00:25:38,150 --> 00:25:40,111
Then cure the poison.

506
00:25:41,190 --> 00:25:42,551
I know it can't be cured.

507
00:25:43,111 --> 00:25:44,390
Even if it's cured,

508
00:25:44,551 --> 00:25:45,630
the Dragon Mountain Empire...

509
00:25:46,831 --> 00:25:47,831
Xueying,

510
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:49,591
you need to stop running away.

511
00:25:50,271 --> 00:25:51,190
I know

512
00:25:51,670 --> 00:25:53,470
compared to not being able to
cure the poison,

513
00:25:53,670 --> 00:25:55,271
what you fear more is

514
00:25:55,470 --> 00:25:57,111
even if the poison is cured,

515
00:25:57,111 --> 00:25:59,031
you still can't save
Dragon Mountain Empire.

516
00:25:59,511 --> 00:26:00,630
Qingshi said

517
00:26:00,950 --> 00:26:02,551
I'm destined to be a hero.

518
00:26:04,230 --> 00:26:05,031
But since the moment

519
00:26:05,031 --> 00:26:06,430
my mother was captured,

520
00:26:07,311 --> 00:26:08,311
what I've been thinking about

521
00:26:08,311 --> 00:26:09,950
is to reunite my family
as soon as possible.

522
00:26:10,910 --> 00:26:11,670
I never thought about

523
00:26:11,670 --> 00:26:12,991
becoming a great hero.

524
00:26:13,630 --> 00:26:15,230
Later, after joining Changfeng Academy,

525
00:26:15,470 --> 00:26:17,351
I got involved in the conflict
between humans and demons.

526
00:26:18,071 --> 00:26:19,551
For every demon I killed,

527
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:21,031
I took on more responsibility.

528
00:26:21,910 --> 00:26:23,991
Now, the responsibility is too heavy.

529
00:26:24,430 --> 00:26:25,870
It's like I'm dreaming.

530
00:26:26,630 --> 00:26:27,551
So,

531
00:26:28,271 --> 00:26:29,311
you don't want to take on

532
00:26:29,311 --> 00:26:30,470
the responsibility anymore?

533
00:26:30,710 --> 00:26:31,511
On the contrary.

534
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:33,591
I, more than anyone else,

535
00:26:33,591 --> 00:26:35,190
want to protect Dragon Mountain Empire.

536
00:26:36,111 --> 00:26:36,991
So,

537
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,630
you should let go of your worries

538
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:41,150
and fight for it until the end.

539
00:26:41,751 --> 00:26:42,551
I will be with you,

540
00:26:42,551 --> 00:26:43,950
fighting by your side,

541
00:26:45,390 --> 00:26:46,950
like how we cooperated

542
00:26:46,950 --> 00:26:48,150
in the Transcendent exam.

543
00:26:48,311 --> 00:26:50,150
I will be your strongest support.

544
00:26:54,230 --> 00:26:55,511
It's like this.

545
00:27:03,630 --> 00:27:04,791
You said that when you came down
from the Heavenly Realm,

546
00:27:04,791 --> 00:27:05,991
you only had a small injury.

547
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:08,190
But it clearly is damage to
your divine veins.

548
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:09,390
It is not a minor injury.

549
00:27:15,470 --> 00:27:16,950
The material world
between gods and Xia Clan

550
00:27:16,950 --> 00:27:18,071
is different.

551
00:27:19,470 --> 00:27:20,630
If I wanted to stay
in the Dragon Mountain Empire

552
00:27:20,630 --> 00:27:21,870
for a long time,

553
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:24,111
I had to make a choice.

554
00:27:24,670 --> 00:27:25,710
Choice?

555
00:27:27,870 --> 00:27:28,831
Xueying,

556
00:27:29,430 --> 00:27:31,031
this is my own choice.

557
00:27:31,950 --> 00:27:33,511
Rather than living in the cold

558
00:27:33,511 --> 00:27:34,991
and high above world,

559
00:27:35,390 --> 00:27:36,870
it's better to be with friends

560
00:27:36,870 --> 00:27:37,630
who have feelings and justice

561
00:27:38,071 --> 00:27:39,311
with wine and stories.

562
00:27:40,230 --> 00:27:40,950
But...

563
00:27:40,950 --> 00:27:42,150
No more buts.

564
00:27:42,390 --> 00:27:44,111
The Divine Realm is so dazzling

565
00:27:44,111 --> 00:27:45,551
that it hurt my eyes.

566
00:27:46,430 --> 00:27:48,230
The scenery of
the Xueying Territory is better.

567
00:27:48,390 --> 00:27:49,430
Don't you agree?

568
00:28:01,150 --> 00:28:02,230
From now on,

569
00:28:03,470 --> 00:28:04,470
let's enjoy the most beautiful scenery

570
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:06,230
of the Xueying Territory together.

571
00:28:22,150 --> 00:28:22,910
Xinhuo Palace

572
00:28:22,910 --> 00:28:24,311
has recorded a rumor.

573
00:28:25,311 --> 00:28:26,071
What rumor?

574
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,190
It's said in the Red Stone Mountain,

575
00:28:27,190 --> 00:28:28,910
there is an armor
of Dragon Mountain Emperor.

576
00:28:29,031 --> 00:28:30,950
Once worn, you can be invincible.

577
00:28:31,071 --> 00:28:32,111
Even fighting against Demon God

578
00:28:32,111 --> 00:28:33,150
is not a problem.

579
00:28:33,950 --> 00:28:35,511
I have some impression
of Red Stone Mountain.

580
00:28:35,751 --> 00:28:37,351
It is a fiery stream of light

581
00:28:37,511 --> 00:28:38,591
that came from the Divine Realm

582
00:28:38,670 --> 00:28:40,190
and crashed onto
the Dragon Mountain Continent,

583
00:28:40,351 --> 00:28:41,751
forming an insurmountably high mountain.

584
00:28:41,751 --> 00:28:42,551
That's right.

585
00:28:42,670 --> 00:28:43,511
And its interior

586
00:28:43,511 --> 00:28:44,751
is even more unfathomable.

587
00:28:44,950 --> 00:28:45,551
It seems like

588
00:28:45,551 --> 00:28:46,910
a tiny point,

589
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:48,390
even smaller than a grain of sand.

590
00:28:48,630 --> 00:28:49,551
But the closer you get to it,

591
00:28:49,551 --> 00:28:50,430
the larger it becomes.

592
00:28:50,511 --> 00:28:52,190
So large it seems endless.

593
00:28:52,430 --> 00:28:53,910
You can't use the proper word

594
00:28:53,910 --> 00:28:55,230
to describe its size.

595
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:02,351
Red Stone Mountain

596
00:29:02,551 --> 00:29:04,190
(Red Stone Mountain)
is located on the border of the Empire.

597
00:29:04,831 --> 00:29:06,111
Over the years,

598
00:29:06,351 --> 00:29:07,670
no one has ever obtained

599
00:29:07,670 --> 00:29:08,551
the armor

600
00:29:08,591 --> 00:29:09,670
and no one has ever been able to

601
00:29:09,670 --> 00:29:11,351
truly come out of Red Stone Mountain.

602
00:29:13,031 --> 00:29:13,831
I will go.

603
00:29:14,551 --> 00:29:15,430
For the Xia Clan,

604
00:29:16,351 --> 00:29:17,271
rather than dragging on,

605
00:29:17,271 --> 00:29:18,271
I'd rather take a risk.

606
00:29:18,430 --> 00:29:19,791
As long as there is a glimmer of hope,

607
00:29:20,190 --> 00:29:21,271
I don't want to give up.

608
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:23,991
Xueying,

609
00:29:24,591 --> 00:29:25,591
I will go with you.

610
00:29:25,591 --> 00:29:26,430
No matter what happens,

611
00:29:26,430 --> 00:29:27,710
I will always be with you.

612
00:29:30,351 --> 00:29:31,230
Xueying,

613
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:32,031
so are we.

614
00:29:32,031 --> 00:29:32,831
We will also go.

615
00:29:33,470 --> 00:29:35,150
We agreed to fight together.

616
00:29:35,150 --> 00:29:36,470
No one can leave anyone behind.

617
00:29:37,311 --> 00:29:38,031
I think

618
00:29:38,311 --> 00:29:39,791
you need the power of companions.

619
00:29:59,751 --> 00:30:01,230
Dongbo Xueying

620
00:30:01,430 --> 00:30:03,150
actually went to Red Stone Mountain.

621
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:04,511
It seems he is scared.

622
00:30:05,031 --> 00:30:06,190
Throughout history,

623
00:30:06,390 --> 00:30:07,591
few people have made it through

624
00:30:07,591 --> 00:30:08,991
the test of Red Stone Mountain.

625
00:30:09,470 --> 00:30:10,470
Go.

626
00:30:11,190 --> 00:30:12,670
Kill him.

627
00:30:12,710 --> 00:30:13,470
Okay.

628
00:30:13,791 --> 00:30:14,791
Wait a moment.

629
00:30:15,511 --> 00:30:16,791
I will go with you.

630
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:18,791
Let us, the second

631
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,311
and third priests of the Demon Clan,

632
00:30:20,791 --> 00:30:23,111
kill Dongbo Xueying together.

633
00:30:33,311 --> 00:30:35,351
I didn't expect
the legendary Red Stone Mountain

634
00:30:35,551 --> 00:30:37,031
to be like this.

635
00:30:37,791 --> 00:30:39,230
I guess it's have been uninhabited
for a long time

636
00:30:39,230 --> 00:30:40,311
with constant exposure to wind and sun,

637
00:30:40,351 --> 00:30:41,710
so it gradually became barren.

638
00:31:02,710 --> 00:31:03,710
Find a place to hide first.

639
00:31:03,751 --> 00:31:04,430
Over there.

640
00:31:44,591 --> 00:31:45,511
Unexpectedly,

641
00:31:45,670 --> 00:31:47,430
Red Stone Mountain is like this.

642
00:31:47,630 --> 00:31:48,751
One moment it's clear skies,

643
00:31:48,751 --> 00:31:49,950
the next moment it's a fierce sandstorm.

644
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:51,150
Xueying, look.

645
00:31:53,430 --> 00:31:54,230
Go and check.

646
00:32:04,591 --> 00:32:05,950
These people are so strange.

647
00:32:06,111 --> 00:32:07,831
Are they dead or alive?

648
00:32:09,551 --> 00:32:10,751
They may be dead.

649
00:32:12,430 --> 00:32:13,311
Dead.

650
00:32:13,950 --> 00:32:15,751
Why would they die in a place like this?

651
00:32:15,870 --> 00:32:16,390
And it is

652
00:32:16,390 --> 00:32:17,511
such a bizarre way to die.

653
00:32:17,751 --> 00:32:18,670
And their faces

654
00:32:18,670 --> 00:32:19,430
all look peaceful

655
00:32:19,430 --> 00:32:20,870
as if they didn't even struggle.

656
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:23,390
There's something wrong here.

657
00:32:23,670 --> 00:32:24,430
We should leave first.

658
00:32:24,430 --> 00:32:25,511
Don't fall into the trap.

659
00:32:49,328 --> 00:32:51,485
(Water Daoist Temple)

660
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:52,430
Xueying.

661
00:32:53,150 --> 00:32:53,910
Xueying.

662
00:32:53,950 --> 00:32:54,670
Jingqiu.

663
00:32:54,831 --> 00:32:55,950
Are you here to the Water Daoist Temple

664
00:32:55,950 --> 00:32:57,150
to celebrate for us?

665
00:32:57,390 --> 00:32:59,311
How can a celebration be without me?

666
00:33:02,111 --> 00:33:03,150
Faction Leader.

667
00:33:03,390 --> 00:33:04,991
How is your cultivation recently?

668
00:33:04,991 --> 00:33:05,470
Youyue.

669
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:06,111
Master.

670
00:33:06,111 --> 00:33:07,111
Naughty boy.

671
00:33:07,150 --> 00:33:08,230
Master.

672
00:33:11,831 --> 00:33:12,630
Sister.

673
00:33:12,630 --> 00:33:13,591
Yue.

674
00:33:14,031 --> 00:33:14,791
Father.

675
00:33:15,390 --> 00:33:15,991
Father.

676
00:33:16,190 --> 00:33:17,910
You've become more beautiful.

677
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:19,791
Little brother.

678
00:33:21,910 --> 00:33:22,511
Master,

679
00:33:22,910 --> 00:33:23,831
where's my master?

680
00:33:24,071 --> 00:33:25,071
Did Xueying

681
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:26,751
make you sad?

682
00:33:27,071 --> 00:33:28,311
Of course not.

683
00:33:28,591 --> 00:33:30,190
Master He, where's my master?

684
00:33:31,351 --> 00:33:33,230
Are you practicing diligently?

685
00:33:34,390 --> 00:33:35,390
Yue,

686
00:33:35,670 --> 00:33:37,390
are you doing well?

687
00:33:37,630 --> 00:33:39,910
I miss you so much.

688
00:33:40,991 --> 00:33:42,071
Faction Leader,
how have you been lately?

689
00:33:42,071 --> 00:33:43,031
I miss you too.

690
00:33:43,031 --> 00:33:43,630
Master.

691
00:33:43,630 --> 00:33:45,071
I have already scolded Moyang Chen.

692
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,910
They're all dead.

693
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,071
This is an illusion.

694
00:33:50,910 --> 00:33:52,150
If we stay here,

695
00:33:53,111 --> 00:33:54,710
we will be like the bodies outside,

696
00:33:55,591 --> 00:33:56,910
trapped here forever.

697
00:33:58,670 --> 00:33:59,831
I'm fine.

698
00:34:00,311 --> 00:34:01,870
Jingqiu, wake up.

699
00:34:02,150 --> 00:34:03,111
This is an illusion.

700
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:05,031
It is not real.

701
00:34:07,831 --> 00:34:09,111
He ran away from me.

702
00:34:09,111 --> 00:34:09,871
Puyang Bo,

703
00:34:10,750 --> 00:34:11,471
wake up.

704
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:16,551
Youyue.

705
00:34:16,951 --> 00:34:17,511
Father.

706
00:34:23,471 --> 00:34:24,230
Father.

707
00:34:26,511 --> 00:34:27,310
Youyue.

708
00:34:31,111 --> 00:34:33,190
I know all of this is fake.

709
00:34:34,391 --> 00:34:36,551
But I really don't want to wake up.

710
00:34:38,150 --> 00:34:39,071
How great it would be

711
00:34:39,071 --> 00:34:40,710
if all this was real.

712
00:34:41,310 --> 00:34:43,111
Youyue, we understand

713
00:34:43,111 --> 00:34:44,511
the pain of losing loved ones,

714
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:46,310
but we have to face reality.

715
00:34:46,310 --> 00:34:46,830
Right now,

716
00:34:46,830 --> 00:34:47,991
we need your Visionary Gaze

717
00:34:47,991 --> 00:34:48,951
to break this illusion.

718
00:34:48,991 --> 00:34:49,670
Otherwise,

719
00:34:49,790 --> 00:34:51,310
we'll be trapped here to death.

720
00:34:51,790 --> 00:34:52,871
Yes, Youyue.

721
00:34:52,991 --> 00:34:54,511
Our seniors can't die in vain.

722
00:34:54,951 --> 00:34:55,710
They were still waiting

723
00:34:55,710 --> 00:34:57,071
for you to go out
and take revenge for them.

724
00:35:15,270 --> 00:35:16,270
Xueying,

725
00:35:16,471 --> 00:35:17,551
it is a formation.

726
00:35:17,710 --> 00:35:18,991
Attack as I say.

727
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:20,150
Azure Dragon.

728
00:35:23,951 --> 00:35:24,670
Vermilion Bird.

729
00:35:26,871 --> 00:35:27,670
White Tiger.

730
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:30,511
Black Tortoise.

731
00:35:36,871 --> 00:35:38,871
I am the protector
of Red Stone Mountain,

732
00:35:39,111 --> 00:35:39,991
Xi Wei.

733
00:35:40,991 --> 00:35:41,951
Greetings, Senior.

734
00:35:42,670 --> 00:35:43,911
I am Dongbo Xueying.

735
00:35:43,911 --> 00:35:45,111
I am Yu Jingqiu.

736
00:35:45,190 --> 00:35:46,230
I am Puyang Bo.

737
00:35:46,350 --> 00:35:47,551
I am Kong Youyue.

738
00:35:47,830 --> 00:35:49,111
We specifically came to
Red Stone Mountain

739
00:35:49,111 --> 00:35:49,991
for help.

740
00:35:50,710 --> 00:35:52,750
The fact you made it here and saw me

741
00:35:52,951 --> 00:35:54,190
is already quite impressive.

742
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,391
The reward of Red Stone Mountain

743
00:35:56,391 --> 00:35:57,310
isn't so easily

744
00:35:57,310 --> 00:35:58,190
obtained.

745
00:35:58,670 --> 00:36:00,350
Once you pass the test,

746
00:36:00,511 --> 00:36:02,911
you will naturally get what you want.

747
00:36:03,071 --> 00:36:05,391
The test of Red Stone Mountain
isn't simple.

748
00:36:05,591 --> 00:36:06,830
A slight carelessness

749
00:36:06,991 --> 00:36:08,630
could cost your life.

750
00:36:08,951 --> 00:36:10,551
If you regret it now,

751
00:36:10,551 --> 00:36:11,511
it's not too late.

752
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:13,511
You can turn around and leave.

753
00:36:14,630 --> 00:36:16,471
If you're truly determined,

754
00:36:17,111 --> 00:36:18,310
then follow me.

755
00:36:19,551 --> 00:36:20,551
We will follow you.

756
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,591
Be careful.

757
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:53,551
Go.

758
00:36:58,630 --> 00:36:59,310
Youyue.

759
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:00,310
Youyue.

760
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:01,750
Are you okay?

761
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:02,991
I'm fine, and you?

762
00:37:03,670 --> 00:37:04,310
Go.

763
00:39:44,871 --> 00:39:45,710
Princess,

764
00:39:46,551 --> 00:39:47,310
did you

765
00:39:47,310 --> 00:39:48,630
remember anything?

766
00:39:51,391 --> 00:39:52,630
When I was young,

767
00:39:53,830 --> 00:39:55,830
my parents always

768
00:39:56,270 --> 00:39:58,511
creatively built
many beautiful snowmen for me.

769
00:40:00,270 --> 00:40:01,551
Some looked like tigers.

770
00:40:01,871 --> 00:40:02,991
Some looked like deer.

771
00:40:03,630 --> 00:40:05,111
Some were broken.

772
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:08,391
Mother would use techniques to fix them,

773
00:40:08,630 --> 00:40:09,871
but father wouldn't let her,

774
00:40:10,071 --> 00:40:11,991
saying it was more fun
to build them ourselves.

775
00:40:12,591 --> 00:40:13,991
Mother couldn't persuade him,

776
00:40:14,190 --> 00:40:15,551
so she threw snowballs at him.

777
00:40:16,310 --> 00:40:17,350
At that time,

778
00:40:17,551 --> 00:40:19,471
you also built many snowmen.

779
00:40:19,830 --> 00:40:21,551
How could I build snowmen?

780
00:40:21,911 --> 00:40:23,911
I just rolled some snowballs

781
00:40:24,230 --> 00:40:25,871
to mess with them.

782
00:40:32,391 --> 00:40:34,431
Although I learned to use techniques

783
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,511
to make all kinds of snow animals,

784
00:40:37,591 --> 00:40:39,031
my favorite is still

785
00:40:39,230 --> 00:40:40,591
the first snow bunny

786
00:40:40,591 --> 00:40:41,871
Father taught me.

787
00:40:45,031 --> 00:40:45,630
This is also one of

788
00:40:45,630 --> 00:40:47,150
my few memories.

789
00:40:47,591 --> 00:40:48,471
Princess,

790
00:40:49,471 --> 00:40:50,790
you've never had

791
00:40:51,270 --> 00:40:53,190
the chance to see this memory.

792
00:40:53,391 --> 00:40:55,230
Today I will use the Mirror

793
00:40:55,591 --> 00:40:56,871
to show you.

794
00:41:01,431 --> 00:41:02,511
(When she is born,)

795
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:04,391
(I want to take her
to see the sunrise at the East Sea)

796
00:41:04,630 --> 00:41:06,031
(and the phoenix at West Mountain.)

797
00:41:06,270 --> 00:41:07,431
(When she grows a little older,)

798
00:41:08,270 --> 00:41:09,471
(I'll let her taste)

799
00:41:09,790 --> 00:41:11,551
(the most delicious nectar.)

800
00:41:12,071 --> 00:41:14,031
(You're thinking about spoiling her
before she's even born.)

801
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:15,230
(When she's born,)

802
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:16,710
(you're going to spoil her badly.)

803
00:41:17,991 --> 00:41:19,111
(What's wrong with spoiling?)

804
00:41:19,750 --> 00:41:20,750
(My own child,)

805
00:41:20,750 --> 00:41:22,190
(of course, is the most precious.)

806
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:24,710
(I will make you)

807
00:41:24,830 --> 00:41:27,230
(the happiest baby in Heavenly Realm.)

808
00:41:32,431 --> 00:41:33,270
Father.

809
00:41:34,911 --> 00:41:35,871
Mother.

810
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:38,991
I finally found

811
00:41:38,991 --> 00:41:40,471
my father and mother.

812
00:42:10,347 --> 00:42:16,072
