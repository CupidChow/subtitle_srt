is just awakened.

23
00:01:57,619 --> 00:01:58,940
In the future, when you cultivate,

24
00:01:59,539 --> 00:02:00,940
you must rest more.

25
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:02,539
If you need

26
00:02:02,660 --> 00:02:03,539
anything,

27
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,460
feel free to find me.

28
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:12,180
Well,

29
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:14,619
I won't bother you anymore.

30
00:02:14,740 --> 00:02:15,779
I need to discuss it with Xueying.

31
00:02:16,059 --> 00:02:16,740
Xueying.

32
00:02:17,219 --> 00:02:18,260
Xueying.

33
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,379
Situ Hong?

34
00:02:20,659 --> 00:02:21,659
What do you want

35
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:22,379
from Xueying?

36
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:24,180
I'm parched.

37
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:26,939
Is there anything else?

38
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,740
If not,

39
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:29,300
we have something
to discuss with Xueying.

40
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:30,980
I think you should get lost.

41
00:02:47,099 --> 00:02:48,379
If only I had listened to you.

42
00:02:48,460 --> 00:02:49,659
The sun is too bright.

43
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,420
Xueying,

44
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:52,499
you saw the situation

45
00:02:52,619 --> 00:02:53,540
with Hero Shan.

46
00:02:53,659 --> 00:02:54,339
Master Bai Yuanzhi has been plagued

47
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:55,980
by the demonic poison for years.

48
00:02:56,379 --> 00:02:57,740
Both Puyang Bo and I

49
00:02:57,899 --> 00:02:59,379
are worried about his condition.

50
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:00,819
Yes.

51
00:03:01,099 --> 00:03:02,499
What if he can't resist

52
00:03:02,580 --> 00:03:03,619
the demonic poison

53
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,379
and ends up like Hero Shan?

54
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:06,659
I was planning

55
00:03:06,779 --> 00:03:08,779
to discuss countermeasures

56
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:10,219
with Master Sikong and Bai Yuanzhi.

57
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,219
I-I have a stomachache.

58
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:19,219
Ate something bad?

59
00:03:19,499 --> 00:03:20,379
No.

60
00:03:20,460 --> 00:03:21,980
Youyue and I ate lunch together.

61
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:27,700
No, no, no, it's not that kind of pain.

62
00:03:30,460 --> 00:03:32,300
Puyang Bo, are you alright?

63
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,260
Sit up.

64
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,219
Your breath is unstable.

65
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:39,339
Move to calm down.

66
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,860
I'm in too much pain to sit still

67
00:03:41,860 --> 00:03:43,140
and you want me to move.

68
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:52,779
Are you feeling better?

69
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,219
Why is it suddenly so unstable?

70
00:04:00,059 --> 00:04:01,219
I don't know.

71
00:04:02,020 --> 00:04:03,180
Youyue and I

72
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,420
were planning to find you this morning.

73
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,860
I did what she did.

74
00:04:05,939 --> 00:04:07,099
Ate what she ate.

75
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:07,939
She's fine.

76
00:04:08,540 --> 00:04:09,260
How come my breath

77
00:04:09,260 --> 00:04:10,540
is disordered?

78
00:04:12,020 --> 00:04:12,700
No.

79
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:15,099
There's one thing we did differently.

80
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:16,340
You used it

81
00:04:16,459 --> 00:04:17,379
but I didn't.

82
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:19,900
Tea.

83
00:04:23,619 --> 00:04:24,579
Xueying,

84
00:04:24,699 --> 00:04:26,259
it seems someone wanted to harm you

85
00:04:26,379 --> 00:04:27,019
but Puyang Bo

86
00:04:27,139 --> 00:04:28,540
accidentally took it.

87
00:04:28,660 --> 00:04:29,579
Who is it?

88
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:31,939
I'll teach them a lesson.

89
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:33,220
No one

90
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:34,300
has touched my tea.

91
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:36,819
No one has been in my room.

92
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:38,900
Unless...

93
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,100
Situ Hong.

94
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:45,499
Nothing good happens when I meet him.

95
00:04:45,499 --> 00:04:46,579
I'll find him now.

96
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:51,860
Situ Hong.

97
00:04:54,300 --> 00:04:55,300
You're addicted to playing tricks,

98
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,499
aren't you?

99
00:04:56,860 --> 00:04:58,379
What are you talking about?

100
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:00,980
I don't understand.

101
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:01,740
Fine.

102
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,699
You don't understand. Then tell me

103
00:05:03,819 --> 00:05:04,980
why you are standing here.

104
00:05:05,059 --> 00:05:06,019
Are you checking

105
00:05:06,019 --> 00:05:06,540
if you put
the right amount of poison in his tea

106
00:05:06,540 --> 00:05:07,900
or if Xueying falls down or not?

107
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:14,059
Why do you

108
00:05:14,819 --> 00:05:16,660
always talk about medicine?

109
00:05:17,619 --> 00:05:19,420
I think you should take medicine.

110
00:05:21,259 --> 00:05:22,540
I lost my jade pendant,

111
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:24,139
so I came to look for it.

112
00:05:24,220 --> 00:05:25,579
What jade pendant?

113
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,420
You.

114
00:05:33,139 --> 00:05:33,939
Puyang Bo.

115
00:05:37,100 --> 00:05:37,860
Puyang Bo.

116
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,180
This is Energy Gathering Pill.

117
00:05:40,300 --> 00:05:41,220
It helps stabilize your inner breath.

118
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:42,019
Take it now.

119
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:44,180
Quick.

120
00:05:50,059 --> 00:05:50,939
You just started practicing

121
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,579
the advanced moves of the Shadow Blade

122
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:53,499
and used a lot of Internal Energy

123
00:05:53,579 --> 00:05:54,819
in a short time.

124
00:05:54,980 --> 00:05:56,499
I guess that's why

125
00:05:56,579 --> 00:05:57,780
your breath was suddenly chaotic.

126
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:58,939
You're talking nonsense.

127
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:00,139
Zhuo Yi,

128
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:02,180
it's Situ Hong's ill intention.

129
00:06:02,340 --> 00:06:03,780
He put something in the tea

130
00:06:03,980 --> 00:06:05,499
and Puyang Bo accidentally drank it.

131
00:06:05,579 --> 00:06:06,540
That's why this happened.

132
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:08,340
Where is the tea?

133
00:06:08,459 --> 00:06:09,180
I'll go get it.

134
00:06:16,579 --> 00:06:17,259
It's here.

135
00:06:17,379 --> 00:06:18,619
I'll give it to the Elder Council

136
00:06:18,780 --> 00:06:20,420
to see what medicine

137
00:06:20,499 --> 00:06:21,499
he put in it.

138
00:06:24,619 --> 00:06:25,780
What are you doing?

139
00:06:26,059 --> 00:06:26,819
Didn't you suspect

140
00:06:26,819 --> 00:06:28,139
that there's a problem
with this cup of tea?

141
00:06:28,459 --> 00:06:30,139
Look, I drank it

142
00:06:30,340 --> 00:06:31,100
and there's no

143
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:32,459
breath instability.

144
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,499
It's not the tea's problem.

145
00:06:36,019 --> 00:06:37,420
It's because the time was too short.

146
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:55,459
Look, almost 15 minutes

147
00:06:55,579 --> 00:06:56,660
have passed.

148
00:06:56,900 --> 00:06:58,220
And I am still fine.

149
00:06:58,459 --> 00:07:00,499
It's not the tea's problem.

150
00:07:00,619 --> 00:07:02,740
It's Puyang Bo's
unstable Internal Energy.

151
00:07:05,019 --> 00:07:05,699
Then why

152
00:07:05,819 --> 00:07:06,819
is Situ Hong still not leaving

153
00:07:07,059 --> 00:07:08,579
and lurking outside the door?

154
00:07:08,780 --> 00:07:09,540
First,

155
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:11,579
I didn't lurk.

156
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:12,939
Second,

157
00:07:13,420 --> 00:07:14,939
I made it very clear just now

158
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,379
I came to find my jade pendant.

159
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:20,180
Your jade pendant.

160
00:07:21,259 --> 00:07:22,619
Since it's all a misunderstanding,

161
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,019
everyone should go back.

162
00:07:28,540 --> 00:07:30,059
As a boy,

163
00:07:30,499 --> 00:07:32,540
you should
practice your breathing regularly.

164
00:07:32,819 --> 00:07:33,860
Otherwise,

165
00:07:33,980 --> 00:07:35,860
you'll often need medicine.

166
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,300
Situ Hong, you...

167
00:07:39,819 --> 00:07:40,660
Youyue, Youyue.

168
00:07:40,819 --> 00:07:41,540
Forget it. Forget it.

169
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,619
Ignore him.

170
00:07:42,740 --> 00:07:43,780
Puyang Bo.

171
00:07:44,059 --> 00:07:45,059
Xueying.

172
00:07:45,499 --> 00:07:47,100
You just let him go like this?

173
00:07:47,259 --> 00:07:48,019
I still think

174
00:07:48,019 --> 00:07:49,220
there's something fishy about this.

175
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:50,619
This is clearly

176
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:52,300
Situ Hong's doing.

177
00:07:52,900 --> 00:07:54,139
But we have no evidence,

178
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:55,900
so it's a waste of time to continue.

179
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:56,780
Don't forget

180
00:07:56,980 --> 00:07:57,340
we have

181
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:58,379
more important things to do.

182
00:07:58,699 --> 00:07:59,379
Right.

183
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,180
Youyue, simmer down.

184
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:01,980
Simmer down.

185
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:02,860
Next time,

186
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:03,980
we'll catch him red-handed,

187
00:08:03,980 --> 00:08:05,019
so he has no way to argue,

188
00:08:05,019 --> 00:08:05,699
alright?

189
00:08:06,259 --> 00:08:08,059
Besides, we came to find Xueying

190
00:08:08,180 --> 00:08:09,180
to discuss

191
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:10,780
Bai Yuanzhi and Sikong Yang's affairs, right?

192
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:12,459
We can't forget about the main issue.

193
00:08:13,220 --> 00:08:14,059
Alright then.

194
00:08:14,499 --> 00:08:15,780
Let's deal with the main issue first.

195
00:08:16,540 --> 00:08:17,660
This time,

196
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,340
I'll put it

197
00:08:19,459 --> 00:08:20,780
on my revenge memo.

198
00:08:23,259 --> 00:08:25,019
You have such a memo?

199
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:26,059
Am I on it?

200
00:08:37,459 --> 00:08:38,380
When will you stop

201
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,219
following me?

202
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,739
So you sealed off

203
00:08:47,739 --> 00:08:49,020
your own breath.

204
00:08:49,099 --> 00:08:50,819
That's how you managed to be unharmed.

205
00:08:51,180 --> 00:08:51,900
I've practiced

206
00:08:51,900 --> 00:08:53,380
the breath technique
of True Meaning of Taixu,

207
00:08:53,500 --> 00:08:54,380
so I am most familiar

208
00:08:54,380 --> 00:08:55,300
with adjusting the pulse.

209
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:56,099
I can retain

210
00:08:56,099 --> 00:08:57,579
the superficial circulation of breath

211
00:08:57,859 --> 00:08:59,780
while adjusting
the deep inner power on my own.

212
00:08:59,900 --> 00:09:01,059
This technique is really good,

213
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:02,219
but

214
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:03,620
since you already know

215
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:04,660
my secret,

216
00:09:05,459 --> 00:09:06,339
I...

217
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:10,339
Who sent you?

218
00:09:11,339 --> 00:09:12,459
Why did you help me?

219
00:09:13,219 --> 00:09:15,020
You are a capable person.

220
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:16,180
I'm willing to believe

221
00:09:16,180 --> 00:09:17,059
you're not a bad person.

222
00:09:17,459 --> 00:09:18,900
We are all

223
00:09:18,900 --> 00:09:20,699
trying our best to survive.

224
00:09:23,140 --> 00:09:24,660
Don't meddle in
other people's affairs in the future.

225
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,739
Otherwise,

226
00:09:29,339 --> 00:09:30,739
I'll definitely kill you.

227
00:09:33,780 --> 00:09:34,739
Do you really want to beat

228
00:09:34,739 --> 00:09:35,859
Dongbo Xueying that much?

229
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:38,300
Someday,

230
00:09:38,780 --> 00:09:40,859
Dongbo Xueying will be defeated

231
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:43,219
by me.

232
00:09:56,660 --> 00:09:57,500
Look,

233
00:09:58,339 --> 00:09:59,819
the moon tonight

234
00:09:59,939 --> 00:10:01,180
is so round and bright.

235
00:10:01,979 --> 00:10:03,260
It's been a long time

236
00:10:03,380 --> 00:10:04,699
since I've seen such a beautiful moon.

237
00:10:07,500 --> 00:10:08,660
Such a pity, though,

238
00:10:09,579 --> 00:10:11,459
the moon has
its waxing and waning phases.

239
00:10:12,459 --> 00:10:14,900
Senior, you're too sentimental,

240
00:10:15,260 --> 00:10:16,059
making the kids

241
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:17,380
afraid to speak.

242
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:21,979
Do you have

243
00:10:21,979 --> 00:10:23,300
any important matters?

244
00:10:23,540 --> 00:10:24,300
Senior,

245
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:26,260
a few days ago we went to Qing River

246
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,140
and found out...

247
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:28,140
That the demon you saw

248
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:29,780
was the poisoned Hero Shan.

249
00:10:30,979 --> 00:10:32,059
You both knew?

250
00:10:33,380 --> 00:10:34,900
I knew what the outcome will be
after being poisoned

251
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:36,339
by the demonic poison.

252
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:38,620
So twenty years ago,

253
00:10:38,739 --> 00:10:40,540
I wanted to end my life,

254
00:10:41,099 --> 00:10:41,979
so as not to become

255
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:43,660
a demon that would harm the Xia Clan.

256
00:10:44,540 --> 00:10:45,459
But

257
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,420
because of an unfinished task,

258
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,859
I couldn't leave so easily.

259
00:10:49,979 --> 00:10:50,819
Yes.

260
00:10:50,939 --> 00:10:52,620
In order to protect me,

261
00:10:53,059 --> 00:10:54,739
Senior was accidentally
infected by the demonic poison.

262
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:57,420
If it weren't for my senior brother...

263
00:10:57,739 --> 00:10:58,939
Alright, alright.

264
00:10:59,459 --> 00:11:00,819
Talking about these things.

265
00:11:00,979 --> 00:11:02,900
Who was to protect you?

266
00:11:04,020 --> 00:11:05,420
Don't make us seem so intimate,

267
00:11:05,540 --> 00:11:07,059
as if we were a couple.

268
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:08,939
But

269
00:11:09,300 --> 00:11:11,260
as long as the Demon Clan exists,

270
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,500
they will be plotting

271
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:14,420
to continue their attack
on our Xia Clan.

272
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:15,939
As long as the Demon Clan exists,

273
00:11:16,020 --> 00:11:16,819
our Xia Clan

274
00:11:17,020 --> 00:11:18,819
will not have a single day of peace.

275
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:22,099
Senior and I will hold on

276
00:11:22,620 --> 00:11:24,300
to the very last day we can

277
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:25,739
to protect the Xia Clan

278
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:26,979
and eradicate the Demon Clan.

279
00:11:27,140 --> 00:11:29,859
It is our lifelong mission.

280
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,059
Xueying,

281
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:33,780
if one day,

282
00:11:33,979 --> 00:11:35,420
we become like Hero Shan,

283
00:11:35,420 --> 00:11:36,420
losing our minds

284
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:37,819
and turning

285
00:11:37,819 --> 00:11:38,900
into uncontrollable demons,

286
00:11:39,859 --> 00:11:41,739
you must be ruthless.

287
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:42,459
Master Bai,

288
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:43,939
Master,

289
00:11:44,459 --> 00:11:46,059
"Fortune favors the virtuous."

290
00:11:46,380 --> 00:11:47,620
You will be fine for sure.

291
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:49,939
You will definitely be alright.

292
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:51,459
Once we defeat Great Demon God,

293
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,459
we will get the antidote

294
00:11:52,459 --> 00:11:53,660
for the demonic poison from them.

295
00:11:54,059 --> 00:11:54,859
At that time,

296
00:11:54,859 --> 00:11:56,140
you will be safe and sound.

297
00:11:56,260 --> 00:11:57,380
Miss Youyue is right.

298
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:58,900
Both of you masters
shouldn't worry too much.

299
00:11:59,020 --> 00:12:00,059
You will definitely be fine.

300
00:12:02,339 --> 00:12:03,180
Alright, Senior,

301
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,900
don't go against the children's wishes.

302
00:12:05,219 --> 00:12:07,059
Let's not talk about unhappy things.

303
00:12:07,059 --> 00:12:09,380
Come, let's all enjoy the moon.

304
00:12:28,500 --> 00:12:29,459
(Xueying,)

305
00:12:29,819 --> 00:12:31,140
(what's on your mind?)

306
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,699
(Elder Ye is heartbroken)

307
00:12:32,699 --> 00:12:34,380
(because of Hero Shan's incident.)

308
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:36,500
(Master Bai and Master Sikong)

309
00:12:36,859 --> 00:12:38,059
(have also been infected
with the demonic poison.)

310
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:41,180
Now the Elder Council
has suffered heavy casualties.

311
00:12:41,780 --> 00:12:43,099
The entire Dragon Mountain Empire

312
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,459
is in grave danger.

313
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:46,579
Is that all you wanted to say?

314
00:12:46,819 --> 00:12:47,979
And the remnants of Demon God.

315
00:12:48,099 --> 00:12:49,459
I really don't know where to find it.

316
00:12:50,339 --> 00:12:51,420
The Demon Clan is invading,

317
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:52,780
one wave after another.

318
00:12:53,620 --> 00:12:54,459
Suddenly, I feel

319
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:55,739
the road ahead is very dark

320
00:12:56,339 --> 00:12:57,420
and I am very confused.

321
00:12:58,260 --> 00:12:59,059
Xueying,

322
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,180
you practiced at the Changfeng Academy,

323
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,739
improving your martial arts

324
00:13:05,099 --> 00:13:06,300
and elevating from a Mortal Knight

325
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,420
to Transcendent.

326
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:08,780
Since that day,

327
00:13:09,339 --> 00:13:11,339
you are a qualified warrior
of the Xia Clan.

328
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:13,260
Not only do you shoulder

329
00:13:13,260 --> 00:13:14,579
the mission to protect the Xia Clan,

330
00:13:14,739 --> 00:13:15,900
but you also should have the ability

331
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,979
to withstand pressure and sadness.

332
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,500
But now I really don't know

333
00:13:20,500 --> 00:13:21,620
how to hold on.

334
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:26,260
As long as you have faith,

335
00:13:26,620 --> 00:13:28,260
you will be able to hold on.

336
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,660
You are so lost now,

337
00:13:31,819 --> 00:13:33,059
not like a disciple

338
00:13:33,059 --> 00:13:34,180
from Changfeng Academy.

339
00:13:36,939 --> 00:13:38,099
Nor like a qualified disciple of mine,

340
00:13:38,099 --> 00:13:39,180
Chi Qiubai's disciple.

341
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,380
Master.

342
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:43,300
Xueying,

343
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:45,579
why do you practice martial arts?

344
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:47,819
Without firm faith,

345
00:13:47,939 --> 00:13:48,939
no matter how powerful you are,

346
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:50,739
you're just exercising.

347
00:13:51,660 --> 00:13:53,380
How could you have become like this

348
00:13:54,219 --> 00:13:55,859
when I valued you so much
in the beginning?

349
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,300
(I understand now.)

350
00:14:02,020 --> 00:14:03,099
(I will find
the remnants of the Demon God)

351
00:14:03,099 --> 00:14:04,059
(as soon as possible)

352
00:14:04,219 --> 00:14:05,339
(and destroy him.)

353
00:14:06,579 --> 00:14:07,300
(What you need is not)

354
00:14:07,300 --> 00:14:08,459
(my encouragement and comfort.)

355
00:14:09,020 --> 00:14:10,099
(What you need)

356
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,900
(is to eliminate
the distractions in your mind)

357
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,500
(and to stick to
your original intention.)

358
00:14:15,219 --> 00:14:16,780
(You need to grow up soon.)

359
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:18,900
(Only by breaking through yourself)

360
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:20,099
(and relying on your own strength)

361
00:14:20,219 --> 00:14:21,859
(to fight against
helplessness and loneliness,)

362
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:24,540
(can you have firm faith.)

363
00:14:26,620 --> 00:14:27,859
At that time,

364
00:14:28,699 --> 00:14:30,660
you will be a true powerhouse.

365
00:14:32,660 --> 00:14:33,540
(Xueying,)

366
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:36,099
(if one day I am gone,)

367
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,380
(you become the only hope
for the Xia Clan.)

368
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,859
(For what I cannot do,)

369
00:14:41,540 --> 00:14:43,339
(only you can make it in the future.)

370
00:14:44,380 --> 00:14:45,620
(I will definitely become a qualified)

371
00:14:45,620 --> 00:14:46,579
(Changfeng disciple.)

372
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,660
(To find Great Demon God's remnants.)

373
00:14:49,699 --> 00:14:50,540
(But)

374
00:14:51,180 --> 00:14:52,660
(where should I start?)

375
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:10,140
Rong,

376
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:11,780
whether you believe it or not,

377
00:15:12,140 --> 00:15:13,859
since the day I took you as my disciple,

378
00:15:13,979 --> 00:15:14,739
until now,

379
00:15:16,059 --> 00:15:18,099
I have never thought about putting you

380
00:15:18,219 --> 00:15:19,699
in a deadly situation.

381
00:15:19,900 --> 00:15:21,859
I'd rather be killed now
than be like this.

382
00:15:26,699 --> 00:15:28,420
It's not too late for everything.

383
00:15:29,140 --> 00:15:30,699
You still have a chance.

384
00:15:30,939 --> 00:15:32,059
The people of Xia Clan

385
00:15:32,859 --> 00:15:34,420
will only suspect me,

386
00:15:34,420 --> 00:15:35,300
doubt me,

387
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,140
and never trust me.

388
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:38,260
Have you ever thought

389
00:15:38,260 --> 00:15:39,620
that the problem lies in yourself?

390
00:15:40,099 --> 00:15:40,979
Rong,

391
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,699
if you are truly innocent,

392
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,380
they will trust you.

393
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,459
Who is it?

394
00:16:29,859 --> 00:16:31,780
(I was truly tricked by them.)

395
00:16:37,579 --> 00:16:38,780
Greetings, Second Priest.

396
00:16:39,339 --> 00:16:40,579
I knew you

397
00:16:40,699 --> 00:16:41,739
would definitely come to save me.

398
00:16:41,900 --> 00:16:42,579
Ji Rong,

399
00:16:43,180 --> 00:16:44,660
don't be too happy too soon.

400
00:16:44,780 --> 00:16:46,380
You've been in trouble lately.

401
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,380
I don't understand what you mean,

402
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:49,339
Second Priest.

403
00:16:49,459 --> 00:16:50,780
You should be very clear

404
00:16:50,979 --> 00:16:52,180
you are just a half-demon.

405
00:16:52,900 --> 00:16:54,300
The Demon Clan trusted you,

406
00:16:54,459 --> 00:16:55,380
relied on you,

407
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:57,780
and gave you
the important tasks of Third Priest.

408
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:59,459
But your recent performance

409
00:16:59,660 --> 00:17:01,420
has disappointed Great Demon God

410
00:17:01,699 --> 00:17:02,540
and even made me

411
00:17:02,540 --> 00:17:03,859
doubt your loyalty.

412
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:06,299
Second Priest,

413
00:17:06,580 --> 00:17:07,380
Ji Rong is absolutely loyal

414
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,499
to the Demon Clan.

415
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:10,180
You misunderstood me.

416
00:17:10,779 --> 00:17:12,140
A few days ago,
it was because my master

417
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,219
locked me up.

418
00:17:13,380 --> 00:17:14,459
I lost my freedom,

419
00:17:14,620 --> 00:17:15,340
so I couldn't

420
00:17:15,340 --> 00:17:16,420
get in touch with Demon God Association.

421
00:17:16,539 --> 00:17:17,699
This was not my intention.

422
00:17:19,299 --> 00:17:20,019
Fine,

423
00:17:20,779 --> 00:17:21,820
I will give you another chance

424
00:17:21,820 --> 00:17:23,299
to atone for your sins.

425
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:24,979
Thank you, Second Priest.

426
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:26,900
I will definitely do my best.

427
00:17:27,820 --> 00:17:29,180
Great Demon God has already gained

428
00:17:29,180 --> 00:17:29,979
the Witch God Sword.

429
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,620
Use it to kill Xueying

430
00:17:31,779 --> 00:17:33,459
and take his Ancient Bloodline's blood.

431
00:17:33,939 --> 00:17:36,180
The Witch God Sword
is next to the Demon Well.

432
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,539
After you find it,

433
00:17:37,539 --> 00:17:38,779
take it to Leichao Sea Cliff.

434
00:17:39,620 --> 00:17:40,739
Can you do it?

435
00:17:42,140 --> 00:17:43,259
I will definitely get it done.

436
00:17:45,947 --> 00:17:48,728
(Xueying Territory)

437
00:17:50,340 --> 00:17:51,259
Commander Zong.

438
00:17:52,739 --> 00:17:53,699
Knight Changfeng.

439
00:17:55,459 --> 00:17:57,060
Didn't Xueying return with you?

440
00:17:57,219 --> 00:17:58,939
He just had awakened
his Ancient Bloodline

441
00:17:59,060 --> 00:18:00,140
and his breath is unstable,

442
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,140
so he still needs to rest.

443
00:18:02,140 --> 00:18:03,900
That's fine. It's good to rest well.

444
00:18:04,019 --> 00:18:04,979
I came this time

445
00:18:05,140 --> 00:18:06,580
to check the Demon Well.

446
00:18:06,779 --> 00:18:07,860
Can you show me the way?

447
00:18:07,979 --> 00:18:08,620
Sure.

448
00:18:09,459 --> 00:18:10,739
Is there anything wrong
with the Demon Clan?

449
00:18:10,860 --> 00:18:12,219
No. Don't worry.

450
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:13,259
Please.

451
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,820
Commander Zong.

452
00:18:28,420 --> 00:18:29,499
Thank you all.

453
00:18:30,180 --> 00:18:32,539
Standing guard may be boring,

454
00:18:32,699 --> 00:18:33,820
but it's indispensable.

455
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:35,860
Without your protection,

456
00:18:36,140 --> 00:18:37,739
there would be no peace in our homeland.

457
00:18:38,299 --> 00:18:39,779
We still need to train and reorganize,

458
00:18:39,939 --> 00:18:40,939
so we can maintain

459
00:18:40,939 --> 00:18:42,420
a state of readiness
for battle at any time.

460
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,620
Guarding day after day

461
00:18:44,779 --> 00:18:45,739
is not easy.

462
00:18:46,219 --> 00:18:47,420
Today, since I'm here,

463
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:49,180
you could take a break.

464
00:18:49,340 --> 00:18:50,939
You can go down the mountain to rest.

465
00:18:51,100 --> 00:18:52,499
Commander Zong and I

466
00:18:52,620 --> 00:18:53,660
will watch over here.

467
00:18:55,219 --> 00:18:55,979
Commander Zong,

468
00:18:56,499 --> 00:18:57,259
what do you think?

469
00:18:59,699 --> 00:19:00,699
Of course, it's good.

470
00:19:01,299 --> 00:19:02,299
You all go ahead.

471
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,539
Thank you, Commander Zong.

472
00:19:13,979 --> 00:19:14,900
These little soldiers

473
00:19:14,900 --> 00:19:16,100
are actually quite pitiful.

474
00:19:16,499 --> 00:19:17,660
The youngest among them

475
00:19:17,660 --> 00:19:18,580
was only 14 years old

476
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,299
when he became a soldier.

477
00:19:21,259 --> 00:19:24,100
14 years old is the time for studying.

478
00:19:24,420 --> 00:19:26,499
Yes, but most of them

479
00:19:26,499 --> 00:19:27,779
had their parents killed by demons,

480
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:29,140
causing their families to be broken.

481
00:19:29,900 --> 00:19:31,060
They became soldiers here.

482
00:19:31,180 --> 00:19:33,100
One, they can be fed.

483
00:19:33,259 --> 00:19:34,499
Two, they can kill the demons

484
00:19:34,499 --> 00:19:35,459
and avenge their parents.

485
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:37,060
As long as
the Demon Clan is not eliminated,

486
00:19:37,620 --> 00:19:38,340
such tragedies

487
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,420
will continue to happen.

488
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,779
The Demon Clan has caused

489
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:44,219
countless families to be separated,
and homes to be destroyed.

490
00:19:45,060 --> 00:19:46,699
So many people
have lost their closest and dearest

491
00:19:46,820 --> 00:19:48,699
because of the Demon Clan.

492
00:19:49,459 --> 00:19:51,779
I remember when times were peaceful,

493
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,060
everyone loved to gather around me
and listen to stories.

494
00:19:55,380 --> 00:19:56,539
At that time,

495
00:19:56,979 --> 00:19:58,459
a good story

496
00:19:58,979 --> 00:20:00,860
could be exchanged
for a pot of good wine.

497
00:20:04,979 --> 00:20:05,900
Commander Zong.

498
00:20:09,900 --> 00:20:11,580
It is not appropriate
since we are still guarding

499
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:12,939
and it's daytime.

500
00:20:13,219 --> 00:20:14,299
Do you still have stories?

501
00:20:21,219 --> 00:20:22,219
Good wine.

502
00:20:24,539 --> 00:20:25,539
Ying and Shi

503
00:20:25,539 --> 00:20:27,259
loved listening to my stories
when they were young.

504
00:20:27,939 --> 00:20:29,060
Every time they said,

505
00:20:29,420 --> 00:20:31,219
"Uncle Zong, have a drink."

506
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,140
I knew

507
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:35,620
they wanted to hear a story.

508
00:20:36,779 --> 00:20:37,699
It's hard to imagine Xueying

509
00:20:37,699 --> 00:20:39,620
clinging to you
and listening to your story.

510
00:20:42,459 --> 00:20:43,860
Ying may look cold,

511
00:20:44,340 --> 00:20:46,259
but he's actually warm-hearted.

512
00:20:46,739 --> 00:20:47,860
Yet he likes

513
00:20:47,860 --> 00:20:49,539
to keep things to himself
and not speak up.

514
00:20:50,019 --> 00:20:52,219
Just like when Miss Yu left last time,

515
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:55,060
he was extremely reluctant,

516
00:20:55,739 --> 00:20:56,340
but in order to

517
00:20:56,340 --> 00:20:57,860
let Miss Yu leave with peace of mind,

518
00:20:58,340 --> 00:20:59,699
he didn't say a word.

519
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:02,820
Actually, even if Xueying didn't say it,

520
00:21:03,620 --> 00:21:04,660
I knew it.

521
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,140
Knowing or not knowing is one thing,

522
00:21:09,499 --> 00:21:10,620
and saying or not saying

523
00:21:11,299 --> 00:21:12,660
is another matter.

524
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:15,140
We

525
00:21:15,499 --> 00:21:17,900
have to speak up.

526
00:21:22,699 --> 00:21:23,699
Uncle Zong,

527
00:21:24,420 --> 00:21:25,420
I'm sorry.

528
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,739
(Ao Lan said)

529
00:21:56,340 --> 00:21:57,580
(the Witch God Sword)

530
00:21:57,699 --> 00:21:59,259
(is meant to deal with Xueying.)

531
00:22:00,340 --> 00:22:02,180
(It is a test from the Demon Clan.)

532
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,779
(What should I do?)

533
00:22:05,259 --> 00:22:06,699
(I can't just let)

534
00:22:06,900 --> 00:22:07,699
(the Demon Clan)

535
00:22:07,699 --> 00:22:09,340
(kill Xueying.)

536
00:22:09,699 --> 00:22:11,340
I must destroy you.

537
00:22:41,299 --> 00:22:41,979
No.

538
00:22:42,539 --> 00:22:43,900
You've been with me for so many years.

539
00:22:44,019 --> 00:22:45,299
I can't destroy you.

540
00:22:51,259 --> 00:22:52,100
Alright,

541
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,060
this time I'll listen to you.

542
00:23:32,420 --> 00:23:33,340
Thank you, Senior.

543
00:23:55,660 --> 00:23:56,939
(Chi Qiubai.)

544
00:23:57,299 --> 00:23:58,539
(How could he be here?)

545
00:24:05,019 --> 00:24:06,259
Chi Qiubai.

546
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:09,219
Why is the Witch God Sword in your hand?

547
00:24:11,620 --> 00:24:13,019
Now there are two things

548
00:24:13,019 --> 00:24:14,060
you need to do.

549
00:24:14,340 --> 00:24:15,259
First,

550
00:24:15,860 --> 00:24:17,860
fetch the Witch God Sword
from Xueying Territory.

551
00:24:18,539 --> 00:24:19,259
Witch God Sword

552
00:24:19,259 --> 00:24:20,900
was cast by the brother of Demon God,

553
00:24:21,140 --> 00:24:22,620
Witch God, with his energy core

554
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,060
before dying.

555
00:24:24,259 --> 00:24:25,219
The witch poison has no cure.

556
00:24:25,539 --> 00:24:27,019
What do you want
the Witch God Sword for?

557
00:24:27,779 --> 00:24:29,699
To kill your most beloved student,

558
00:24:30,019 --> 00:24:31,539
Dongbo Xueying.

559
00:24:31,820 --> 00:24:33,499
How did you promise me back then,

560
00:24:33,939 --> 00:24:35,620
saying you would never harm Xueying?

561
00:24:35,820 --> 00:24:37,380
Back then was back then.

562
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,820
Now things have changed.

563
00:24:40,060 --> 00:24:41,459
His Ancient Bloodline

564
00:24:41,739 --> 00:24:42,820
may threaten the safety

565
00:24:42,820 --> 00:24:44,019
of Great Demon God at any time.

566
00:24:44,219 --> 00:24:45,299
His blood

567
00:24:45,580 --> 00:24:47,380
can also be refined
into Soul Condensing Pill.

568
00:24:47,580 --> 00:24:49,420
The Witch God Sword
has the power to extract blood.

569
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:51,060
I want his blood

570
00:24:51,340 --> 00:24:53,299
for the use of my Demon Clan.

571
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:54,620
What is the second thing?

572
00:24:54,739 --> 00:24:55,860
Kill Ji Rong.

573
00:24:55,979 --> 00:24:56,860
Ji Rong?

574
00:24:57,180 --> 00:24:58,900
She is the third priest
of the Demon Clan,

575
00:24:59,140 --> 00:25:00,580
but she is a half-demon.

576
00:25:00,820 --> 00:25:02,820
Her stance has always been unclear

577
00:25:03,019 --> 00:25:04,860
and she even
took a mortal as her master.

578
00:25:05,219 --> 00:25:06,299
Time and time again,

579
00:25:06,299 --> 00:25:07,860
she has refused
the orders of our Demon Clan.

580
00:25:08,259 --> 00:25:09,860
I suspect she is not entirely loyal.

581
00:25:10,499 --> 00:25:11,539
Kill her

582
00:25:12,019 --> 00:25:13,219
and set an example.

583
00:25:13,580 --> 00:25:15,340
But Ji Rong is close to Master Bai,

584
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,979
I'm afraid
it will be difficult to do it.

585
00:25:17,259 --> 00:25:19,219
You just go and get the Witch God Sword

586
00:25:19,820 --> 00:25:21,660
and Ji Rong will come to you.

587
00:25:24,499 --> 00:25:25,660
Knight Changfeng,

588
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:28,779
once you complete these tasks,

589
00:25:29,420 --> 00:25:31,420
you will be the third priest
of the Demon Clan.

590
00:25:32,539 --> 00:25:33,860
You don't need to know.

591
00:25:34,539 --> 00:25:36,380
(The Witch God Sword
is in his possession.)

592
00:25:36,539 --> 00:25:38,340
(Could this be the intention
of the Demon Clan?)

593
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,340
Knight Changfeng.

594
00:25:41,939 --> 00:25:43,060
Knight Changfeng.

595
00:25:47,779 --> 00:25:48,620
Commander Zong,

596
00:25:48,979 --> 00:25:49,900
you are awake.

597
00:25:51,380 --> 00:25:51,979
Come on.

598
00:25:54,140 --> 00:25:55,739
Is it my wine that's strong,

599
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:57,340
or is your alcohol tolerance weak?

600
00:25:59,499 --> 00:26:00,699
Maybe I'm getting old.

601
00:26:00,699 --> 00:26:02,380
I actually got drunk
on this little bit of wine.

602
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,939
I feel like I just had a nap.

603
00:26:05,979 --> 00:26:07,299
Knight Changfeng, you...

604
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:08,180
I'm hungry.

605
00:26:08,580 --> 00:26:09,539
Is there anything to eat?

606
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:11,660
Yes. Let's go.

607
00:26:11,779 --> 00:26:12,820
I'll make you something delicious.

608
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:21,979
(She actually escaped)

609
00:26:21,979 --> 00:26:23,580
(from Chi Qiubai.)

610
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,979
Did you get the item?

611
00:26:27,180 --> 00:26:28,539
It's my incompetence.

612
00:26:28,779 --> 00:26:30,539
The Witch God Sword
was taken by Chi Qiubai.

613
00:26:31,660 --> 00:26:33,539
Chi Qiubai attacked you?

614
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:34,939
If it wasn't for
Zong Ling's interruption,

615
00:26:34,979 --> 00:26:36,219
I would have been killed by him.

616
00:26:40,699 --> 00:26:43,060
Chi Qiubai also used demonic technique.

617
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,620
Is he one of us?

618
00:26:49,580 --> 00:26:51,259
You actually sent him to kill me.

619
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:53,580
I've been loyal
to the Demon Clan for so long

620
00:26:53,739 --> 00:26:55,420
and I've done so much
for the Demon Clan.

621
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:57,060
Yet, you want to kill me.

622
00:26:57,100 --> 00:26:57,979
Ji Rong,

623
00:26:58,299 --> 00:26:59,380
you still don't understand

624
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:00,660
your own identity.

625
00:27:00,979 --> 00:27:02,299
Your father and your master

626
00:27:02,299 --> 00:27:03,420
are both human.

627
00:27:03,499 --> 00:27:05,340
Now you have joined the Demon Clan,

628
00:27:05,499 --> 00:27:06,100
but when will you

629
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:07,660
return to the embrace of humanity?

630
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,420
I won't.

631
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:10,340
Now it has come to
the most crucial moment

632
00:27:10,340 --> 00:27:12,219
for our Demon Clan.

633
00:27:12,420 --> 00:27:13,499
I can't tolerate

634
00:27:13,499 --> 00:27:14,900
any uncertainty.

635
00:27:15,380 --> 00:27:16,699
Chi Qiubai is also human,

636
00:27:16,699 --> 00:27:17,779
so why do you trust him?

637
00:27:17,779 --> 00:27:18,820
Foolish.

638
00:27:19,299 --> 00:27:21,860
Value is more important than trust.

639
00:27:22,060 --> 00:27:24,140
His identity within the Xia Clan

640
00:27:24,259 --> 00:27:25,259
can help our Demon Clan

641
00:27:25,259 --> 00:27:26,380
get things done more smoothly.

642
00:27:26,939 --> 00:27:27,699
Besides,

643
00:27:28,180 --> 00:27:29,580
I have something on him.

644
00:27:30,019 --> 00:27:30,979
I am the same.

645
00:27:31,180 --> 00:27:31,900
I can do

646
00:27:31,939 --> 00:27:32,860
what he can.

647
00:27:33,459 --> 00:27:34,380
You?

648
00:27:34,699 --> 00:27:36,259
What value do you have left?

649
00:27:37,219 --> 00:27:38,340
Today, I will consider

650
00:27:38,340 --> 00:27:39,100
your past contributions

651
00:27:39,100 --> 00:27:40,380
to the Demon Clan

652
00:27:40,539 --> 00:27:42,180
and let you die a little faster.

653
00:27:45,660 --> 00:27:46,620
Xueying.

654
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,380
Dongbo Xueying.

655
00:27:49,699 --> 00:27:50,739
I know his younger brother,

656
00:27:50,739 --> 00:27:52,219
Dongbo Qingshi, likes me.

657
00:27:52,699 --> 00:27:54,380
I can use Qingshi

658
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,779
to lure Xueying.

659
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,939
I know Xueying is useful to you.

660
00:28:00,259 --> 00:28:01,420
I can also use Qingshi

661
00:28:01,420 --> 00:28:02,380
to restrain Xueying.

662
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:05,060
If you could really restrain Qingshi,

663
00:28:05,219 --> 00:28:06,900
how could you have failed so many times?

664
00:28:07,180 --> 00:28:08,380
Wait a minute.

665
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,219
Great Demon God.

666
00:28:17,499 --> 00:28:19,779
I'll give you one last chance.

667
00:28:20,219 --> 00:28:22,100
Do as you say

668
00:28:22,340 --> 00:28:24,299
and lure Dongbo Xueying.

669
00:28:24,620 --> 00:28:26,620
If you do well this time,

670
00:28:27,140 --> 00:28:29,140
the position of the third priest

671
00:28:29,380 --> 00:28:30,620
will still be yours.

672
00:28:30,779 --> 00:28:31,580
Master.

673
00:28:31,979 --> 00:28:33,939
Yes. Thank you, Great Demon God.

674
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,900
I will definitely
serve the Demon Clan to the death.

675
00:28:37,180 --> 00:28:38,180
Ao Lan,

676
00:28:38,380 --> 00:28:39,820
give her the item.

677
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,259
At the last moment,

678
00:28:45,259 --> 00:28:46,739
you can take this pill.

679
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:49,060
It can greatly increase your strength

680
00:28:49,219 --> 00:28:50,739
and fight a decisive battle
with the enemy.

681
00:28:52,779 --> 00:28:54,939
Thank you, Great Demon God.
Thank you, Second Priest.

682
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:56,779
I will definitely succeed.

683
00:29:03,061 --> 00:29:09,100
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

684
00:29:09,100 --> 00:29:10,420
Please show your pass.

685
00:29:11,060 --> 00:29:12,459
I don't have a pass.

686
00:29:12,459 --> 00:29:13,539
I'm here to find someone.

687
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:15,620
Without a pass
for Dragon Mountain Mansion,

688
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:16,580
nobody is allowed in.

689
00:29:16,979 --> 00:29:18,299
Sir,

690
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,539
I'm here to find someone.

691
00:29:19,739 --> 00:29:21,019
Let me in to find him

692
00:29:21,019 --> 00:29:22,620
and then I'll naturally have a pass.

693
00:29:22,699 --> 00:29:23,380
No.

694
00:29:25,019 --> 00:29:25,699
Then,

695
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:28,219
can you send someone in to find him?

696
00:29:28,499 --> 00:29:29,779
Just say

697
00:29:30,860 --> 00:29:32,219
Dongbo Qingshi's sister

698
00:29:32,219 --> 00:29:33,100
is looking for him.

699
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:34,820
Dongbo Qingshi's sister?

700
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:36,420
I've never heard

701
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:37,860
that Dongbo Qingshi has a sister.

702
00:29:38,340 --> 00:29:39,580
You send someone in to find him

703
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,739
and you'll know after asking.

704
00:29:43,140 --> 00:29:44,539
Since you're so unwilling,

705
00:29:44,539 --> 00:29:45,499
then I'll leave.

706
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,420
It took me quite a while

707
00:29:47,420 --> 00:29:48,459
to find this place.

708
00:29:48,739 --> 00:29:50,380
If Qingshi asks later,

709
00:29:50,380 --> 00:29:51,900
but you drove his sister away,

710
00:29:52,060 --> 00:29:52,820
then...

711
00:29:53,779 --> 00:29:54,580
Wait a moment.

712
00:29:56,259 --> 00:29:57,660
Hold on, I'll report.

713
00:30:08,180 --> 00:30:10,699
Ji Rong, it is Dragon Mountain Mansion.

714
00:30:10,860 --> 00:30:12,140
That's not a place for you to come.

715
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,660
Qingshi,

716
00:30:15,019 --> 00:30:16,100
I've been looking for you
for a long time

717
00:30:16,100 --> 00:30:17,459
and finally found out you're here.

718
00:30:17,860 --> 00:30:18,939
Why are you looking for me?

719
00:30:19,739 --> 00:30:21,060
I'm sorry, Qingshi.

720
00:30:21,620 --> 00:30:23,219
I know now,

721
00:30:23,580 --> 00:30:24,779
in this world,

722
00:30:25,420 --> 00:30:27,219
only you truly care about me

723
00:30:27,219 --> 00:30:28,259
and truly love me.

724
00:30:30,820 --> 00:30:32,259
Why are you suddenly saying such things?

725
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:33,699
Master and Sikong Yang

726
00:30:33,699 --> 00:30:35,100
don't believe me at all.

727
00:30:35,259 --> 00:30:36,459
They've been misunderstanding me

728
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,620
and have me under arrest.

729
00:30:37,860 --> 00:30:39,900
I escaped with great difficulty.

730
00:30:42,939 --> 00:30:43,900
Go, Ji Rong.

731
00:30:44,620 --> 00:30:46,019
Go back to Master.

732
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,100
I won't go back.

733
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:49,219
If I go back, they will continue

734
00:30:49,219 --> 00:30:50,219
to put me under house arrest.

735
00:30:51,380 --> 00:30:52,900
Can I

736
00:30:53,259 --> 00:30:55,219
stay with you for a while?

737
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:55,979
No.

738
00:30:56,019 --> 00:30:56,779
Don't worry.

739
00:30:56,979 --> 00:30:58,019
I will behave.

740
00:30:58,140 --> 00:30:59,420
I absolutely won't cause you trouble.

741
00:30:59,499 --> 00:31:00,699
It is Dragon Mountain Mansion.

742
00:31:01,259 --> 00:31:02,420
It's not suitable

743
00:31:02,979 --> 00:31:03,860
to keep you here.

744
00:31:04,340 --> 00:31:05,739
Then I have no place

745
00:31:05,739 --> 00:31:06,660
to go.

746
00:31:07,100 --> 00:31:08,820
If you won't take me in,

747
00:31:09,739 --> 00:31:10,979
then I...

748
00:31:15,739 --> 00:31:17,739
You once said you'd give me a home,

749
00:31:17,979 --> 00:31:19,499
no matter where this home is,

750
00:31:19,660 --> 00:31:21,699
as long as it has you and me, it's home.

751
00:31:22,019 --> 00:31:23,499
Have you forgotten all of this?

752
00:31:24,739 --> 00:31:25,779
I just want to

753
00:31:25,779 --> 00:31:27,019
be with you.

754
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,979
No matter where I go, I'm willing.

755
00:31:35,820 --> 00:31:36,620
Alright.

756
00:31:38,259 --> 00:31:38,979
I

757
00:31:39,820 --> 00:31:41,259
can let you stay for now,

758
00:31:41,779 --> 00:31:43,259
but the most important thing now is

759
00:31:44,259 --> 00:31:46,100
to find the traces of Great Demon God.

760
00:31:46,459 --> 00:31:48,140
Only after all this is over,

761
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:49,900
can I take you back to
Xueying Territory.

762
00:31:51,140 --> 00:31:52,299
That's great, Qingshi.

763
00:31:52,299 --> 00:31:53,699
I'm willing to go back with you

764
00:31:53,779 --> 00:31:55,060
and kill the Demon Clan

765
00:31:55,140 --> 00:31:56,779
to contribute to
the elimination of the Demon Clan.

766
00:31:57,499 --> 00:31:58,259
Alright.

767
00:31:58,939 --> 00:31:59,860
I believe in you.

768
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,580
Rong,

769
00:32:01,979 --> 00:32:03,180
rest well.

770
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,420
I still have to be on guard.

771
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:27,699
One day when we

772
00:32:27,860 --> 00:32:29,779
really occupy the Xia Clan,

773
00:32:30,340 --> 00:32:31,499
they

774
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,539
not only will

775
00:32:33,739 --> 00:32:35,499
be defeated by our Demon Clan

776
00:32:35,699 --> 00:32:37,340
but also defeated by their confusion

777
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:39,259
and fear.

778
00:32:39,739 --> 00:32:41,140
And only our Demon Clan,

779
00:32:41,140 --> 00:32:43,420
such a loyal

780
00:32:43,539 --> 00:32:44,580
and noble clan

781
00:32:44,739 --> 00:32:47,140
with faith,

782
00:32:47,380 --> 00:32:49,459
deserves to rule the world.

783
00:32:49,660 --> 00:32:51,060
You are absolutely right, Master.

784
00:32:51,779 --> 00:32:53,140
Why should we

785
00:32:53,140 --> 00:32:55,100
curl up in this dark and cold

786
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,900
Dark Abyss?

787
00:32:57,259 --> 00:32:59,219
Those inferior humans

788
00:32:59,420 --> 00:33:00,939
don't deserve to live in

789
00:33:01,019 --> 00:33:02,140
Dragon Mountain Empire

790
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:04,140
with abundant water, lush grass,
and blooming flowers.

791
00:33:04,299 --> 00:33:05,340
In the future,

792
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:08,060
that place will definitely be ours.

793
00:33:08,380 --> 00:33:10,340
Moyang Yu

794
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,979
ruined my plans again.

795
00:33:12,180 --> 00:33:13,060
My remnants

796
00:33:13,219 --> 00:33:15,699
need a new host,

797
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:18,620
which will take a long wait.

798
00:33:19,140 --> 00:33:20,100
Otherwise,

799
00:33:20,340 --> 00:33:22,219
Dragon Mountain Empire

800
00:33:22,420 --> 00:33:25,219
would have been ours long ago.

801
00:33:25,779 --> 00:33:27,299
Master, you can rest assured.

802
00:33:27,580 --> 00:33:28,620
We will definitely think of

803
00:33:28,620 --> 00:33:29,660
new methods.

804
00:33:31,900 --> 00:33:33,860
They will never expect

805
00:33:34,580 --> 00:33:37,140
the current Knight Changfeng

806
00:33:37,580 --> 00:33:41,340
will become a future Demon Clan Knight.

807
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:48,779
Rong,

808
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,299
why are you here?

809
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:52,620
I was afraid
you'd be hungry when guarding,

810
00:33:52,820 --> 00:33:54,019
so I made you some pastries.

811
00:33:54,259 --> 00:33:55,100
Don't worry.

812
00:33:55,259 --> 00:33:56,779
I was very careful on my way here.

813
00:33:56,779 --> 00:33:57,699
No one discovered me.

814
00:33:57,779 --> 00:33:58,699
You should stay

815
00:33:58,699 --> 00:33:59,499
in the room.

816
00:33:59,779 --> 00:34:01,019
Don't take any more risks coming out.

817
00:34:01,420 --> 00:34:02,739
Alright, I got it.

818
00:34:02,739 --> 00:34:03,459
You should eat now.

819
00:34:03,779 --> 00:34:05,499
It doesn't taste good when it's cold.

820
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,660
I remember you mentioned

821
00:34:07,660 --> 00:34:08,899
in Xueying Territory

822
00:34:08,899 --> 00:34:10,460
that you loved
this osmanthus cake the most.

823
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:16,540
Fine,

824
00:34:17,259 --> 00:34:18,100
I'll eat.

825
00:34:28,060 --> 00:34:29,899
The Dragon Mountain Mansion is so big.

826
00:34:30,100 --> 00:34:31,620
Are you the only one on guard duty?

827
00:34:32,219 --> 00:34:33,259
Of course not.

828
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:35,140
The most valuable information
in Dragon Mountain Mansion

829
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,980
is all here.

830
00:34:36,219 --> 00:34:38,219
Other places are just for archiving,

831
00:34:38,219 --> 00:34:40,500
storing and placing some equipment.

832
00:34:40,980 --> 00:34:42,540
There are mechanisms everywhere here.

833
00:34:42,699 --> 00:34:44,980
It's hard for ordinary people to escape.

834
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:47,899
So Dragon Mountain Mansion

835
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:49,620
doesn't actually need too many guards.

836
00:34:51,219 --> 00:34:52,739
I see.

837
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,859
What's this big stuff?

838
00:34:55,899 --> 00:34:57,100
This is called Heixuan Machine.

839
00:34:57,259 --> 00:34:58,460
The Black Iron Orders issued

840
00:34:58,580 --> 00:34:59,899
by our Dragon Mountain Mansion

841
00:34:59,980 --> 00:35:01,100
will spread to every corner

842
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,020
of Dragon Mountain Empire.

843
00:35:02,379 --> 00:35:03,859
In order to be able

844
00:35:03,859 --> 00:35:04,620
to assemble forces in an emergency,

845
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:06,299
this Heixuan Machine was set up.

846
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,620
It is used to control

847
00:35:07,660 --> 00:35:08,460
all the Black Iron Orders

848
00:35:08,460 --> 00:35:09,540
in our Dragon Mountain Empire.

849
00:35:09,940 --> 00:35:10,660
Alright.

850
00:35:11,739 --> 00:35:12,779
I will finish them.

851
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,660
You shall go back and rest well.

852
00:35:15,299 --> 00:35:17,140
Come back quickly when you are done.

853
00:35:17,299 --> 00:35:18,580
I'll be waiting for you in the room.

854
00:35:28,940 --> 00:35:29,699
Xueying,

855
00:35:29,859 --> 00:35:31,500
there's nothing in Leichao Sea Cliff.

856
00:35:31,699 --> 00:35:33,580
Could there be something wrong

857
00:35:33,859 --> 00:35:35,219
with Qingshi's intelligence?

858
00:35:35,379 --> 00:35:36,739
Qingshi is at Dragon Mountain Mansion

859
00:35:36,739 --> 00:35:38,460
studying intelligence investigation
with Si An.

860
00:35:38,819 --> 00:35:39,580
His intelligence

861
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,620
is more accurate than before.

862
00:35:40,620 --> 00:35:41,259
And

863
00:35:41,660 --> 00:35:43,100
since he dares to

864
00:35:43,100 --> 00:35:43,940
pass on this message,

865
00:35:44,100 --> 00:35:45,819
he must be sure it's correct.

866
00:35:46,980 --> 00:35:49,219
Actually, we had some gains.

867
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:50,660
Look,

868
00:35:51,299 --> 00:35:52,620
I picked this up

869
00:35:52,620 --> 00:35:53,660
near Leichao Sea Cliff.

870
00:35:54,180 --> 00:35:55,259
It's a magic crystal
used to maintain

871
00:35:55,259 --> 00:35:57,180
the Demon Clan's souls.

872
00:35:58,379 --> 00:36:00,500
Maintaining Demon Clan's souls?

873
00:36:00,739 --> 00:36:02,540
There must have been
Great Demon God lurking.

874
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:03,980
Only he would urgently need

875
00:36:03,980 --> 00:36:04,739
this thing in large quantities.

876
00:36:04,779 --> 00:36:06,020
We were one step late.

877
00:36:06,259 --> 00:36:07,219
Or you could say

878
00:36:07,339 --> 00:36:08,020
someone was one step

879
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:08,779
ahead of us.

880
00:36:17,060 --> 00:36:17,819
Stop.

881
00:36:28,100 --> 00:36:29,859
This is sand and gravel
found only by the sea.

882
00:36:29,940 --> 00:36:30,899
Where have you gone?

883
00:36:31,299 --> 00:36:32,660
You're not my wife.

884
00:36:32,779 --> 00:36:33,419
Why do I have to report to you

885
00:36:33,419 --> 00:36:34,660
where I went?

886
00:36:34,739 --> 00:36:36,980
This unique scent from the seaside

887
00:36:37,299 --> 00:36:38,500
smells like...

888
00:36:38,540 --> 00:36:39,419
Sea God Palace.

889
00:36:40,020 --> 00:36:41,180
It was I who asked Situ Hong

890
00:36:41,180 --> 00:36:41,980
to take me

891
00:36:41,980 --> 00:36:43,100
to Sea God Palace.

892
00:36:43,500 --> 00:36:44,620
I have never been to

893
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,899
the sea area of Sea God Palace.

894
00:36:45,980 --> 00:36:47,739
I have always yearned
for the scenery there,

895
00:36:47,980 --> 00:36:49,219
so I asked Situ Hong

896
00:36:49,219 --> 00:36:50,620
to take me for a tour nearby.

897
00:36:52,140 --> 00:36:53,219
Don't believe it? My body

898
00:36:53,219 --> 00:36:54,620
also contains the smell of the sea.

899
00:36:57,339 --> 00:36:58,660
Even if both of you have

900
00:36:58,660 --> 00:36:59,940
the same smell on your bodies,

901
00:37:00,140 --> 00:37:01,180
it can only prove

902
00:37:01,180 --> 00:37:02,580
you have been to the same place.

903
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,339
But it doesn't mean

904
00:37:03,339 --> 00:37:04,460
where you went.

905
00:37:04,540 --> 00:37:05,739
You mean

906
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:07,859
we teamed up to deceive you.

907
00:37:08,980 --> 00:37:09,859
Kong Youyue,

908
00:37:09,940 --> 00:37:11,540
I know you don't like me.

909
00:37:11,779 --> 00:37:14,100
But before you have conclusive evidence,

910
00:37:15,219 --> 00:37:16,259
get out of the way.

911
00:37:16,460 --> 00:37:16,940
You...

912
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:18,339
Youyue.

913
00:37:19,339 --> 00:37:20,339
If you want to go, just go.

914
00:37:20,339 --> 00:37:21,660
Why all the nonsense?

915
00:37:30,779 --> 00:37:32,699
I still feel something is wrong.

916
00:37:34,259 --> 00:37:35,339
Last time,

917
00:37:35,540 --> 00:37:36,259
it was also Zhuo Yi

918
00:37:36,259 --> 00:37:37,540
who helped Situ Hong out.

919
00:37:37,739 --> 00:37:39,339
Situ Hong's relationship
with the Demon Clan

920
00:37:39,339 --> 00:37:40,259
must not be simple.

921
00:37:40,859 --> 00:37:41,980
But the truth

922
00:37:42,219 --> 00:37:43,699
will definitely come to light.

923
00:37:54,819 --> 00:37:55,779
Qingshi.

924
00:37:56,180 --> 00:37:57,020
Qingshi.

925
00:38:00,580 --> 00:38:01,940
I'm sorry, Qingshi.

926
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:05,299
This time I want to live for myself.

927
00:38:12,060 --> 00:38:13,739
(Heixuan Machine that controls)

928
00:38:13,739 --> 00:38:14,779
(all the Black Iron Orders
of Dragon Mountain Mansion)

929
00:38:16,299 --> 00:38:18,180
(is about to be demonized.)

930
00:39:14,100 --> 00:39:15,140
Come chaos.

931
00:39:15,460 --> 00:39:16,779
The more chaotic, the better.

932
00:39:17,779 --> 00:39:19,219
Let the whole Dragon Mountain Empire

933
00:39:19,219 --> 00:39:20,620
be in chaos.

934
00:39:47,620 --> 00:39:49,299
Always stubbornly saying to let go,

935
00:39:50,060 --> 00:39:51,299
but the number of times
you come to the pavilion

936
00:39:51,299 --> 00:39:52,219
is the most.

937
00:39:53,739 --> 00:39:54,299
Princess,

938
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,580
it's so cold today.

939
00:39:57,060 --> 00:39:58,020
Go back and sleep.

940
00:39:59,339 --> 00:40:00,100
Alright.

941
00:40:04,899 --> 00:40:07,020
I wonder how
Dragon Mountain Empire is doing.

942
00:40:07,739 --> 00:40:08,580
Princess,

943
00:40:09,419 --> 00:40:11,540
you and Lord Xueying are separated.

944
00:40:12,739 --> 00:40:13,779
Forget

945
00:40:14,419 --> 00:40:15,419
