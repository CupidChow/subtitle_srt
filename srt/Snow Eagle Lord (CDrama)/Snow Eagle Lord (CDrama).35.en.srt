21
00:01:47,111 --> 00:01:48,551
Why do you want me to come out?

22
00:01:48,711 --> 00:01:49,911
You must be bored staying

23
00:01:49,911 --> 00:01:50,711
in the room all day.

24
00:01:50,831 --> 00:01:51,711
Today is the biggest day

25
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:52,631
for the market event.

26
00:01:52,831 --> 00:01:53,831
I hear there are
even street performances.

27
00:01:54,111 --> 00:01:54,950
That's right.

28
00:01:55,030 --> 00:01:55,590
You know

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:56,911
I grew up in the countryside.

30
00:01:56,911 --> 00:01:58,071
I've never seen
street performances before.

31
00:01:58,150 --> 00:01:58,870
They all look down on me

32
00:01:58,870 --> 00:01:59,510
because of that.

33
00:01:59,510 --> 00:02:00,271
Xueying,

34
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:01,831
do you really

35
00:02:01,870 --> 00:02:02,751
want your best friend

36
00:02:02,751 --> 00:02:03,510
to be looked down upon?

37
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:04,510
Do you?

38
00:02:04,631 --> 00:02:05,430
Do you?

39
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:06,430
Just this once.

40
00:02:07,711 --> 00:02:08,151
Great!

41
00:02:08,151 --> 00:02:09,670
I knew you were the best.

42
00:02:10,390 --> 00:02:11,110
Let's make a plan

43
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:11,871
for today.

44
00:02:11,871 --> 00:02:13,390
First, let's go to the Yipin Restaurant
for a meal.

45
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:13,871
Alright.

46
00:02:13,990 --> 00:02:15,631
Then we'll go to the market
to watch the street performances.

47
00:02:15,631 --> 00:02:16,830
Finally, let's go to a bookstore

48
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:18,191
to see if there are any new stories.

49
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:19,591
Great minds think alike.

50
00:02:19,710 --> 00:02:21,031
Friendship comes late.

51
00:02:21,031 --> 00:02:21,710
Yu Feng,

52
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:23,871
I used to think you were scheming

53
00:02:23,871 --> 00:02:25,071
and not good at speaking.

54
00:02:25,151 --> 00:02:26,710
Turns out you just haven't met

55
00:02:26,830 --> 00:02:28,151
a confidant to open your heart.

56
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:30,191
What's the matter?

57
00:02:35,311 --> 00:02:36,510
Should I go follow him?

58
00:02:37,670 --> 00:02:38,390
Xueying,

59
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:39,591
let me do it.

60
00:02:39,751 --> 00:02:40,990
I want to see

61
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:42,191
what kind of person he is.

62
00:02:42,471 --> 00:02:44,151
Alright. We'll wait for you here.

63
00:03:01,911 --> 00:03:02,751
Are you okay?

64
00:03:03,471 --> 00:03:05,230
The little rabbit is not doing well.

65
00:03:05,990 --> 00:03:06,871
I used

66
00:03:06,990 --> 00:03:07,710
to steal food

67
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:08,871
from home to feed it.

68
00:03:09,191 --> 00:03:09,990
But I haven't seen it

69
00:03:09,990 --> 00:03:11,270
in the past few days.

70
00:03:11,390 --> 00:03:12,871
When I saw it today,

71
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:14,270
it was already like this.

72
00:03:14,351 --> 00:03:15,751
Why can't you

73
00:03:16,351 --> 00:03:17,270
take it home to raise?

74
00:03:17,431 --> 00:03:19,351
I want to take it home,

75
00:03:19,471 --> 00:03:21,071
but my mother won't let me.

76
00:03:28,751 --> 00:03:29,751
What are you doing?

77
00:03:29,871 --> 00:03:31,191
You'll kill it that way.

78
00:03:32,990 --> 00:03:34,031
Poor rabbit.

79
00:03:34,151 --> 00:03:35,591
How can you hurt it like this?

80
00:03:35,751 --> 00:03:38,031
Is this your rabbit?

81
00:03:38,510 --> 00:03:39,871
If not,

82
00:03:39,990 --> 00:03:41,591
don't meddle here.

83
00:03:41,591 --> 00:03:42,230
Fine.

84
00:03:42,390 --> 00:03:43,431
From now on,

85
00:03:43,471 --> 00:03:45,191
I'll be the owner of this rabbit.

86
00:03:45,311 --> 00:03:46,591
I'll take it

87
00:03:46,591 --> 00:03:47,710
back to my house,

88
00:03:47,830 --> 00:03:48,911
let it heal its wound

89
00:03:49,071 --> 00:03:49,670
and never let bad people

90
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:50,871
like you bully it again.

91
00:03:51,591 --> 00:03:52,550
Since you said it,

92
00:03:54,751 --> 00:03:55,550
then we have a deal.

93
00:04:02,830 --> 00:04:03,790
You were saving...

94
00:04:06,751 --> 00:04:07,351
But

95
00:04:07,871 --> 00:04:09,110
why were you so sure someone

96
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:10,230
with a kind heart would save it?

97
00:04:10,631 --> 00:04:11,670
I wasn't sure either.

98
00:04:11,871 --> 00:04:13,230
But in this world,

99
00:04:13,351 --> 00:04:14,550
it's survival

100
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:15,950
of the fittest.

101
00:04:15,950 --> 00:04:17,270
(That's so familiar.)

102
00:04:17,751 --> 00:04:18,631
Was it...?

103
00:04:19,590 --> 00:04:20,991
I just used a spell

104
00:04:21,071 --> 00:04:21,791
to attract the attention

105
00:04:21,791 --> 00:04:22,910
of passersby around me.

106
00:04:23,470 --> 00:04:24,551
The rabbit's wound

107
00:04:24,671 --> 00:04:25,671
could evoke

108
00:04:25,671 --> 00:04:27,191
a strong sense
of sympathy from everyone.

109
00:04:27,431 --> 00:04:28,390
And the flame

110
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:29,991
could burn away its rotting flesh

111
00:04:30,111 --> 00:04:31,270
and cover up

112
00:04:31,270 --> 00:04:32,871
the smell of decay in the air.

113
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:34,510
That way, it could survive.

114
00:04:35,071 --> 00:04:36,111
Kindness

115
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:37,191
is a very precious quality

116
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,231
in this world.

117
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,150
But if you're too weak

118
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:42,631
to protect

119
00:04:42,631 --> 00:04:43,910
what you love,

120
00:04:44,111 --> 00:04:45,431
then your kindness

121
00:04:45,631 --> 00:04:46,950
is useless.

122
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:51,150
This is for your kindness.

123
00:04:52,071 --> 00:04:53,350
Was it him?

124
00:04:53,431 --> 00:04:54,431
Thank you.

125
00:04:54,590 --> 00:04:55,671
It must be him.

126
00:04:56,991 --> 00:04:57,751
How's it going?

127
00:04:58,111 --> 00:04:59,071
Nothing out of the ordinary.

128
00:04:59,191 --> 00:05:00,791
He bought some dried fruits
and went back.

129
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:03,311
He didn't do anything else?

130
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:04,270
I don't see any problems

131
00:05:04,270 --> 00:05:05,311
with Situ Hong.

132
00:05:05,431 --> 00:05:06,910
Maybe you're overthinking it?

133
00:05:10,191 --> 00:05:10,950
Who cares?

134
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:11,631
It's not something

135
00:05:11,631 --> 00:05:12,431
that can be solved in a short time.

136
00:05:12,431 --> 00:05:13,191
Let's get back
to what we were talking about.

137
00:05:13,191 --> 00:05:13,590
Right.

138
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:14,830
We need to hurry
to the Yipin Restaurant,

139
00:05:14,871 --> 00:05:15,768
or there may be no seats for us.

140
00:05:15,768 --> 00:05:16,632
- Let's go.
- Let's go.

141
00:05:16,728 --> 00:05:17,510
You go ahead.

142
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:18,431
I won't go.

143
00:05:19,030 --> 00:05:20,470
Xueying, we agreed on this.

144
00:05:20,510 --> 00:05:21,470
Why change your mind now?

145
00:05:21,551 --> 00:05:22,231
I'm sorry.

146
00:05:22,551 --> 00:05:23,431
I'm just not in the mood.

147
00:05:26,510 --> 00:05:27,470
- Xueying.
- Xueying.

148
00:05:28,311 --> 00:05:29,231
Let him be.

149
00:05:36,639 --> 00:05:39,096
(Moxue Empire)

150
00:05:52,390 --> 00:05:53,510
Your Highness, you're awake.

151
00:05:53,631 --> 00:05:54,311
I'll go inform

152
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:55,350
Mrs. Xue Ruoshuang.

153
00:05:56,671 --> 00:05:57,991
Your Highness.

154
00:06:02,350 --> 00:06:03,191
Your Highness,

155
00:06:03,751 --> 00:06:04,991
you're finally awake.

156
00:06:05,311 --> 00:06:06,551
How do you feel now?

157
00:06:07,191 --> 00:06:08,710
How is Xueying?

158
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:10,390
Look at you.

159
00:06:10,871 --> 00:06:12,431
You just woke up,
and you're worrying about him now.

160
00:06:13,111 --> 00:06:13,751
Your health

161
00:06:13,751 --> 00:06:15,231
really concerns me.

162
00:06:17,350 --> 00:06:18,431
I'm fine.

163
00:06:20,311 --> 00:06:22,231
It might be because I just returned
to the Heavenly Realm.

164
00:06:23,311 --> 00:06:24,910
I feel much better now.

165
00:06:25,390 --> 00:06:26,311
That's good.

166
00:06:26,950 --> 00:06:28,751
But you're still weak.

167
00:06:29,231 --> 00:06:30,950
You need to rest for a while longer.

168
00:06:33,910 --> 00:06:35,231
Thank you, Mrs. Xue.

169
00:07:00,830 --> 00:07:01,751
Xueying,

170
00:07:02,191 --> 00:07:03,150
is this

171
00:07:03,510 --> 00:07:04,871
the last time

172
00:07:04,871 --> 00:07:06,030
I can eat the fish you cook?

173
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:08,231
How could it be?

174
00:07:08,510 --> 00:07:09,830
We will definitely see each other again.

175
00:07:09,830 --> 00:07:10,431
Right?

176
00:07:11,071 --> 00:07:12,551
If I could,

177
00:07:14,551 --> 00:07:15,390
I wish I could eat

178
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:16,910
the fish you cook
for the rest of my life.

179
00:07:18,991 --> 00:07:20,751
(We will definitely see
each other again.)

180
00:07:21,551 --> 00:07:22,350
(Right?)

181
00:07:22,751 --> 00:07:23,791
(I will definitely keep my promise)

182
00:07:23,791 --> 00:07:25,071
(and come to have your grilled fish.)

183
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,150
(I'll definitely come to see you again.)

184
00:07:58,150 --> 00:07:59,871
This is what my mother
passed down to me.

185
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,150
Only the Lord of Xueying Territory

186
00:08:02,150 --> 00:08:03,150
and his wife can wear it.

187
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:05,231
I want to share half with you.

188
00:08:05,671 --> 00:08:06,470
Do you accept?

189
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:32,110
I'd better not disturb him anymore.

190
00:08:32,830 --> 00:08:34,511
Now the demons are rampant,

191
00:08:35,870 --> 00:08:37,750
let's not let love

192
00:08:38,271 --> 00:08:39,710
hinder Xueying anymore.

193
00:08:40,791 --> 00:08:42,110
After this parting,

194
00:08:43,470 --> 00:08:45,590
maybe we won't see
each other again in this life.

195
00:08:48,590 --> 00:08:50,431
I hope you can forget me soon.

196
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,151
Master.

197
00:09:25,071 --> 00:09:26,071
It's you.

198
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:29,071
You have long surpassed me.

199
00:09:31,271 --> 00:09:33,511
Once a teacher, always a teacher.

200
00:09:34,511 --> 00:09:35,870
If it hadn't been for you back

201
00:09:36,191 --> 00:09:37,151
in Yishui City,

202
00:09:37,750 --> 00:09:39,031
I wouldn't have been where I am today.

203
00:09:39,151 --> 00:09:40,630
Since you still recognize me
as your master,

204
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:42,031
I'll say one more thing.

205
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:44,431
Since things have changed,

206
00:09:44,791 --> 00:09:46,350
why not let go sooner?

207
00:09:52,911 --> 00:09:53,911
I can't let go.

208
00:09:56,110 --> 00:09:57,710
I can only move forward
with it weighing me down.

209
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:00,031
You're a grown man.

210
00:10:00,271 --> 00:10:01,391
Stop being sentimental.

211
00:10:02,031 --> 00:10:02,750
Come, let me see

212
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:03,830
if your martial arts have improved.

213
00:11:01,391 --> 00:11:03,110
It seems I'm really not young anymore.

214
00:11:07,271 --> 00:11:07,950
Master,

215
00:11:08,191 --> 00:11:08,911
are you alright?

216
00:11:09,911 --> 00:11:10,911
I'm fine.

217
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:12,391
It's just an old injury.

218
00:11:12,750 --> 00:11:13,791
But Xueying,

219
00:11:14,151 --> 00:11:15,511
you've made progress again.

220
00:11:16,830 --> 00:11:18,110
You're clearly going easy on me.

221
00:11:18,671 --> 00:11:19,950
Excessive modesty

222
00:11:20,071 --> 00:11:21,191
is the same as arrogance.

223
00:11:22,271 --> 00:11:22,911
Master,

224
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:25,590
our tragic losses in the last battle
at the Xueying Territory

225
00:11:25,590 --> 00:11:26,511
are still fresh in my mind.

226
00:11:27,191 --> 00:11:28,830
Although my mother sacrificed herself

227
00:11:28,990 --> 00:11:30,071
to destroy the bronze coffin

228
00:11:30,071 --> 00:11:31,151
and the Great Demon God's body,

229
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:33,031
his remnants still

230
00:11:33,151 --> 00:11:34,551
haven't been completely eliminated.

231
00:11:35,191 --> 00:11:36,110
My mother's power

232
00:11:36,311 --> 00:11:37,791
was probably less
than a tenth of what it once was.

233
00:11:38,230 --> 00:11:39,271
It was really difficult for her

234
00:11:39,271 --> 00:11:40,470
to wipe out the Demon God.

235
00:11:40,830 --> 00:11:41,551
Now,

236
00:11:41,950 --> 00:11:42,870
Ao Lan is lurking in the shadows,

237
00:11:42,870 --> 00:11:43,710
plotting something.

238
00:11:45,151 --> 00:11:46,031
I'm afraid

239
00:11:48,470 --> 00:11:50,110
before I become stronger,

240
00:11:50,630 --> 00:11:52,110
the Demon Clan will rise again.

241
00:11:52,911 --> 00:11:54,110
The current situation

242
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:55,511
is indeed very dangerous.

243
00:11:55,750 --> 00:11:56,191
But with talents like you,

244
00:11:56,311 --> 00:11:57,511
our clan

245
00:11:57,630 --> 00:11:58,950
will surely turn peril into safety.

246
00:11:59,551 --> 00:12:00,391
Xueying,

247
00:12:01,031 --> 00:12:03,031
an individual's power is limited.

248
00:12:03,590 --> 00:12:05,830
You must become a true leader,

249
00:12:06,870 --> 00:12:08,311
uniting everyone

250
00:12:09,230 --> 00:12:10,911
and bringing together the power

251
00:12:11,031 --> 00:12:11,990
of the entire empire.

252
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:14,950
Master,

253
00:12:15,710 --> 00:12:16,470
thank you.

254
00:12:17,671 --> 00:12:18,470
Whenever I don't know

255
00:12:18,470 --> 00:12:19,630
what to do,

256
00:12:19,750 --> 00:12:20,391
you're always here

257
00:12:20,391 --> 00:12:21,470
to guide me.

258
00:12:21,590 --> 00:12:22,431
Xueying,

259
00:12:23,110 --> 00:12:23,870
there's really nothing

260
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:24,870
left for me to teach you.

261
00:12:25,710 --> 00:12:26,750
I'm firmly convinced

262
00:12:27,710 --> 00:12:29,350
that you'll go further
than me on the road ahead.

263
00:12:30,110 --> 00:12:30,950
Master,

264
00:12:31,431 --> 00:12:32,311
what's wrong with you?

265
00:12:33,191 --> 00:12:34,710
Why are you suddenly talking
so sentimentally?

266
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:38,031
Alright.

267
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:40,391
It's getting late.

268
00:12:40,990 --> 00:12:42,031
You should go back.

269
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:44,350
I'll take my leave.

270
00:12:51,110 --> 00:12:53,311
(Xueying's Ancient Bloodline
has awakened.)

271
00:12:54,110 --> 00:12:56,071
(The Demon God
will definitely target him.)

272
00:12:56,830 --> 00:12:57,750
What?

273
00:12:58,750 --> 00:13:00,950
You volunteer to join
the Demon God Association?

274
00:13:01,191 --> 00:13:02,031
Yes.

275
00:13:03,031 --> 00:13:04,191
Previously,

276
00:13:04,311 --> 00:13:04,830
you refused to join our clan

277
00:13:04,830 --> 00:13:06,551
even at the risk of death.

278
00:13:06,870 --> 00:13:08,791
Why the sudden change of heart?

279
00:13:09,110 --> 00:13:09,911
Now the council

280
00:13:09,911 --> 00:13:10,990
has only two people left,

281
00:13:11,271 --> 00:13:13,071
yet they still won't let me join.

282
00:13:13,750 --> 00:13:15,671
I risked my life for them before,

283
00:13:15,870 --> 00:13:17,431
but they treat me like this.

284
00:13:17,750 --> 00:13:19,350
I feel really disheartened.

285
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:21,990
Those Demigod Elders,

286
00:13:22,110 --> 00:13:23,590
one by one, sacrificed themselves.

287
00:13:24,671 --> 00:13:26,750
Even though Moyang Yu
and the bronze coffin

288
00:13:26,950 --> 00:13:28,230
perished together,

289
00:13:28,710 --> 00:13:30,311
she didn't kill the Great Demon God.

290
00:13:30,431 --> 00:13:31,470
The power of the Great Demon God

291
00:13:31,590 --> 00:13:32,710
impresses me.

292
00:13:33,110 --> 00:13:35,870
A wise man submits to fate.

293
00:13:36,151 --> 00:13:36,990
Perhaps,

294
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:39,311
I should choose a new path.

295
00:13:39,830 --> 00:13:41,110
I knew long ago

296
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:43,071
you're a wise man.

297
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:45,830
But your attitude changed so suddenly.

298
00:13:46,071 --> 00:13:47,911
How can I trust you?

299
00:13:48,031 --> 00:13:49,830
Xiaoxi's energy core
is still in your hands.

300
00:13:50,151 --> 00:13:51,551
She is the one I love the most

301
00:13:52,350 --> 00:13:54,151
and the one I can't afford to lose.

302
00:13:54,391 --> 00:13:56,391
Then show me your sincerity.

303
00:13:57,271 --> 00:13:58,551
I have a condition.

304
00:13:58,671 --> 00:13:59,551
What condition?

305
00:14:07,271 --> 00:14:09,431
(Demonic Technique Manual)
This is the mightiest demonic technique.

306
00:14:09,671 --> 00:14:10,911
Practice it.

307
00:14:11,431 --> 00:14:13,311
I look forward to seeing you succeed.

308
00:14:13,431 --> 00:14:14,630
You want me to practice
a demonic technique?

309
00:14:14,750 --> 00:14:16,791
Only by practicing our clan's techniques

310
00:14:17,271 --> 00:14:18,230
can you truly become

311
00:14:18,350 --> 00:14:19,431
one of our clan.

312
00:14:20,710 --> 00:14:21,830
To be honest,

313
00:14:22,110 --> 00:14:24,350
the Demon God highly appreciates you.

314
00:14:24,671 --> 00:14:26,031
Where is the Great Demon God now?

315
00:14:27,911 --> 00:14:29,950
His remnants escaped death.

316
00:14:30,750 --> 00:14:31,911
It's good that he's alright.

317
00:14:33,271 --> 00:14:34,391
Chi Qiubai,

318
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:36,151
don't be so impatient.

319
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:37,671
Once you truly become

320
00:14:37,671 --> 00:14:38,950
one of our clan

321
00:14:39,230 --> 00:14:40,990
and become our right-hand man,

322
00:14:41,630 --> 00:14:42,630
everything about our clan

323
00:14:42,630 --> 00:14:44,431
will naturally be revealed to you.

324
00:15:31,590 --> 00:15:32,710
Chi Qiubai,

325
00:15:32,830 --> 00:15:34,271
practice the demonic technique well

326
00:15:34,431 --> 00:15:35,590
and don't try any tricks.

327
00:15:35,750 --> 00:15:36,791
Otherwise, next time,

328
00:15:36,791 --> 00:15:38,671
the pain won't be just like this.

329
00:15:40,551 --> 00:15:41,551
(Xiaoxi,)

330
00:15:42,511 --> 00:15:43,990
(you'll understand me, right?)

331
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:46,830
(As long as we can
defeat the Demon Clan,)

332
00:15:47,391 --> 00:15:48,830
(even if I die,)

333
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:50,350
(I'm willing to.)

334
00:16:07,071 --> 00:16:08,151
Why?

335
00:16:09,470 --> 00:16:11,511
Why can't I do it?

336
00:16:13,311 --> 00:16:14,551
Moyang Yu,

337
00:16:15,350 --> 00:16:17,830
even on your deathbed, you never told me

338
00:16:17,950 --> 00:16:20,191
the secret of the Ancient Bloodline.

339
00:16:21,911 --> 00:16:24,311
I am your brother.

340
00:16:29,151 --> 00:16:30,151
Second Priest.

341
00:16:30,671 --> 00:16:32,110
More than a decade ago,

342
00:16:32,391 --> 00:16:34,071
you killed Dongbo Lie

343
00:16:34,590 --> 00:16:36,350
and injured Dongbo Xueying.

344
00:16:36,590 --> 00:16:39,071
You've practiced demonic techniques
and joined our clan.

345
00:16:39,590 --> 00:16:41,830
Moyang Yu wholeheartedly
sided with the Xia Clan.

346
00:16:42,151 --> 00:16:43,230
She hasn't considered you as a member

347
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,630
of the Moyang family for a long time.

348
00:16:47,311 --> 00:16:49,151
It's just the Ancient Bloodline.

349
00:16:49,551 --> 00:16:51,110
Look how anxious you are.

350
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:52,630
There is more than one way

351
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,950
to turn things around.

352
00:16:55,830 --> 00:16:57,071
You have a way?

353
00:16:57,750 --> 00:16:59,911
Our clan has a sacred technique.

354
00:17:00,671 --> 00:17:02,151
If you practice it,

355
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:03,311
your cultivation

356
00:17:03,511 --> 00:17:05,110
can reach several times

357
00:17:05,110 --> 00:17:06,350
that of the Ancient Bloodline.

358
00:17:06,511 --> 00:17:08,590
Such a powerful thing.

359
00:17:11,150 --> 00:17:12,311
Why don't you practice it?

360
00:17:13,751 --> 00:17:15,551
Do you think
I don't want to practice it?

361
00:17:16,511 --> 00:17:17,870
Only the ones chosen

362
00:17:18,031 --> 00:17:19,271
by the sacred technique

363
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:20,231
can practice it.

364
00:17:20,670 --> 00:17:22,350
It chose you.

365
00:17:22,471 --> 00:17:23,630
What can I do?

366
00:17:25,551 --> 00:17:26,670
I didn't expect

367
00:17:26,791 --> 00:17:27,471
that I would

368
00:17:27,471 --> 00:17:28,791
have such luck.

369
00:17:28,870 --> 00:17:30,590
Alright, I'll practice.

370
00:17:31,390 --> 00:17:33,150
But you need to think it through.

371
00:17:33,350 --> 00:17:34,791
If you make even
a small mistake practicing it,

372
00:17:35,350 --> 00:17:36,830
it could cost your life.

373
00:17:37,190 --> 00:17:38,711
What is life worth?

374
00:17:38,870 --> 00:17:40,430
I want those people to know

375
00:17:40,590 --> 00:17:41,751
the Moyang family

376
00:17:41,910 --> 00:17:43,590
not only has Moyang Yu

377
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,271
but also me, Moyang Chen.

378
00:17:45,430 --> 00:17:46,791
You indeed have courage,

379
00:17:46,991 --> 00:17:48,870
worthy of being chosen
by the sacred technique.

380
00:17:49,471 --> 00:17:50,350
Why don't we start

381
00:17:50,350 --> 00:17:51,590
practicing it now?

382
00:17:53,110 --> 00:17:54,390
Practicing now?

383
00:17:54,670 --> 00:17:55,590
Shouldn't you give me the manual

384
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,630
to me first?

385
00:17:57,231 --> 00:17:59,791
The sacred technique
has its own rules for cultivation.

386
00:18:00,350 --> 00:18:01,071
What?

387
00:18:01,311 --> 00:18:02,630
You're worried I'm lying to you?

388
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:04,511
Okay.

389
00:18:04,590 --> 00:18:06,190
You tell me. How do we do it?

390
00:18:07,271 --> 00:18:08,150
Adjust your breath.

391
00:18:08,870 --> 00:18:10,071
Open your meridians.

392
00:18:10,110 --> 00:18:10,711
Alright.

393
00:19:33,910 --> 00:19:34,910
Moyang Chen.

394
00:20:02,870 --> 00:20:04,190
Great Demon God.

395
00:20:05,350 --> 00:20:06,511
Ao Lan,

396
00:20:07,791 --> 00:20:09,991
this body is too weak.

397
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:13,071
Didn't I ask you
to catch Dongbo Xueying?

398
00:20:13,190 --> 00:20:14,190
Great Demon God,

399
00:20:15,071 --> 00:20:16,231
Dongbo Xueying's Ancient Bloodline

400
00:20:16,551 --> 00:20:18,471
has already been awakened,

401
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:19,590
so he can't

402
00:20:19,590 --> 00:20:20,590
practice demonic techniques.

403
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:22,711
If you force him
to practice demonic techniques

404
00:20:22,711 --> 00:20:23,991
and enter his body,

405
00:20:24,031 --> 00:20:25,711
his Ancient Bloodline may...

406
00:20:25,910 --> 00:20:27,551
So you want me to stay

407
00:20:27,551 --> 00:20:29,150
in this useless body?

408
00:20:29,150 --> 00:20:30,110
Demon God, please calm down.

409
00:20:31,071 --> 00:20:32,271
This body

410
00:20:32,430 --> 00:20:33,190
is only

411
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,430
for your temporary use.

412
00:20:34,751 --> 00:20:36,071
I have already found

413
00:20:36,190 --> 00:20:37,430
a more suitable body for you.

414
00:20:37,711 --> 00:20:39,190
Who is it?

415
00:20:39,670 --> 00:20:40,670
Chi Qiubai,

416
00:20:41,071 --> 00:20:42,471
Knight Changfeng.

417
00:20:43,031 --> 00:20:44,311
He has superb strength

418
00:20:44,511 --> 00:20:46,350
and high status in the Xia Clan.

419
00:20:46,791 --> 00:20:48,311
He is the most suitable candidate.

420
00:20:48,991 --> 00:20:49,830
So far,

421
00:20:50,231 --> 00:20:51,031
I have already let him

422
00:20:51,031 --> 00:20:52,231
start practicing a demonic technique.

423
00:20:52,511 --> 00:20:53,590
Given time,

424
00:20:53,711 --> 00:20:55,231
once he has mastered
the demonic technique,

425
00:20:55,511 --> 00:20:57,231
we will be able to truly control him

426
00:20:57,350 --> 00:20:59,350
and seize his body.

427
00:21:00,791 --> 00:21:02,830
The matter is settled.

428
00:21:03,951 --> 00:21:06,031
Dongbo Xueying has repeatedly

429
00:21:06,031 --> 00:21:07,830
sabotaged our plans.

430
00:21:08,311 --> 00:21:10,551
Moyang Yu wants to destroy me.

431
00:21:10,711 --> 00:21:13,071
I'll destroy her son first.

432
00:21:13,910 --> 00:21:15,991
As long as I get the Ancient Bloodline

433
00:21:16,190 --> 00:21:17,751
and the Soul Condensing Pill,

434
00:21:18,071 --> 00:21:20,430
my comeback is only a matter of time.

435
00:21:20,751 --> 00:21:22,071
As for him,

436
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:26,110
if he can't be used by me,

437
00:21:27,031 --> 00:21:28,910
find a way

438
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,551
to make him disappear.

439
00:21:31,870 --> 00:21:33,430
Master, your words are very true.

440
00:21:33,870 --> 00:21:35,350
I have already thought of a way

441
00:21:35,511 --> 00:21:36,870
and had someone send a message back
to the Dark Abyss

442
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:38,231
and get the Witch God Sword.

443
00:21:38,991 --> 00:21:42,071
Dongbo Xueying is as good as dead.

444
00:21:44,551 --> 00:21:46,711
The Dragon Mountain Empire

445
00:21:46,991 --> 00:21:50,711
will ultimately be
in the palm of my hand.

446
00:21:53,935 --> 00:21:59,714
(Residence of Diligence)

447
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:06,031
Qingshi.

448
00:22:06,910 --> 00:22:07,630
Brother.

449
00:22:10,150 --> 00:22:12,071
Brother, I have something to tell you.

450
00:22:12,751 --> 00:22:13,430
What's the matter?

451
00:22:13,670 --> 00:22:14,991
I want to join
the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

452
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:18,390
Brother,
I've been thinking a lot lately.

453
00:22:18,590 --> 00:22:20,670
I want to help you, help our mother,

454
00:22:20,791 --> 00:22:22,751
and I want to do something for our clan.

455
00:22:22,991 --> 00:22:24,150
So I've decided

456
00:22:24,271 --> 00:22:25,590
I want to join
the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

457
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,430
Brother,

458
00:22:29,590 --> 00:22:31,110
I made this decision

459
00:22:31,110 --> 00:22:32,150
after careful thought.

460
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:33,590
It's not that I don't disapprove.

461
00:22:34,271 --> 00:22:35,791
But it's not easy

462
00:22:36,150 --> 00:22:37,511
to join the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

463
00:22:38,830 --> 00:22:39,711
I know.

464
00:22:40,311 --> 00:22:41,350
But in this world,

465
00:22:41,430 --> 00:22:42,791
what's easy?

466
00:22:43,471 --> 00:22:45,271
Father, mother

467
00:22:45,390 --> 00:22:46,271
and you.

468
00:22:46,551 --> 00:22:47,830
You're all so amazing.

469
00:22:48,031 --> 00:22:49,150
Facing any difficulty,

470
00:22:49,271 --> 00:22:50,551
you've never backed down.

471
00:22:51,430 --> 00:22:52,190
So

472
00:22:52,711 --> 00:22:53,430
I definitely can't

473
00:22:53,430 --> 00:22:54,350
hold you back.

474
00:22:55,110 --> 00:22:57,150
I want to live up

475
00:22:57,150 --> 00:22:58,071
to the name Dongbo Qingshi.

476
00:23:02,830 --> 00:23:04,190
Since you've made up your mind,

477
00:23:04,471 --> 00:23:05,350
I support you.

478
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:06,791
Tomorrow morning,

479
00:23:07,231 --> 00:23:08,830
I'll take you to Si An
in the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

480
00:23:09,430 --> 00:23:10,511
Thank you, brother.

481
00:23:10,590 --> 00:23:11,150
And

482
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:13,951
Qingshi,

483
00:23:14,511 --> 00:23:15,991
you haven't held us back.

484
00:23:16,670 --> 00:23:17,991
If our parents in heaven

485
00:23:18,190 --> 00:23:19,430
see the Xueying Territory like this,

486
00:23:19,751 --> 00:23:21,311
if they see us like this,

487
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:22,511
they will be at ease.

488
00:23:31,630 --> 00:23:32,551
Working for an intelligence organization

489
00:23:32,551 --> 00:23:33,471
like the Dragon Mountain Mansion

490
00:23:33,471 --> 00:23:34,430
is not easy.

491
00:23:35,350 --> 00:23:36,031
Xueying,

492
00:23:36,791 --> 00:23:37,991
are you willing
to let your brother join?

493
00:23:39,311 --> 00:23:40,590
It's not my decision.

494
00:23:41,110 --> 00:23:42,910
It's Qingshi's own decision.

495
00:23:45,791 --> 00:23:47,630
I volunteer to join you.

496
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:48,870
No matter how hard

497
00:23:49,031 --> 00:23:49,791
or difficult it is,

498
00:23:50,110 --> 00:23:50,910
I'm not afraid.

499
00:23:50,991 --> 00:23:52,471
To join us,

500
00:23:52,791 --> 00:23:54,350
one must pass a test.

501
00:23:54,551 --> 00:23:55,110
We just happen

502
00:23:55,271 --> 00:23:56,390
to have intelligence

503
00:23:56,551 --> 00:23:58,511
that traces of a demon have been found

504
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,071
near the Bloodshed Tavern
by the Qing River.

505
00:24:00,350 --> 00:24:02,071
But I've sent people
to investigate several times

506
00:24:02,231 --> 00:24:02,951
and haven't found

507
00:24:02,951 --> 00:24:04,231
the exact location of the demon.

508
00:24:04,991 --> 00:24:06,471
As long as you can find

509
00:24:06,630 --> 00:24:08,031
and kill the demon,

510
00:24:08,471 --> 00:24:10,311
I'll agree to let you join us.

511
00:24:13,471 --> 00:24:14,590
I accept the mission.

512
00:24:17,830 --> 00:24:18,670
Xueying,

513
00:24:19,511 --> 00:24:21,071
didn't you say you were going
to treat us to a meal?

514
00:24:21,110 --> 00:24:22,031
When will that be?

515
00:24:22,630 --> 00:24:23,791
Xueying,

516
00:24:23,830 --> 00:24:25,190
where are you going?

517
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:28,630
Qingshi took on a mission
from the Dragon Mountain Mansion

518
00:24:28,870 --> 00:24:30,190
to go near the Bloodshed Tavern

519
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,311
to track down a demon.

520
00:24:31,471 --> 00:24:32,590
I'll go with him.

521
00:24:32,830 --> 00:24:34,231
To catch a demon?

522
00:24:34,430 --> 00:24:35,590
I'll go with you.

523
00:24:35,590 --> 00:24:36,350
Puyang Bo.

524
00:24:36,430 --> 00:24:37,830
Xueying, I know

525
00:24:37,991 --> 00:24:39,350
you are now very strong

526
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:40,711
and that catching a demon
is a piece of cake for you,

527
00:24:40,711 --> 00:24:41,390
right?

528
00:24:41,551 --> 00:24:42,150
But

529
00:24:42,150 --> 00:24:43,670
I also want to try my Shadow Blade

530
00:24:43,670 --> 00:24:44,670
to see how well I've practiced.

531
00:24:44,830 --> 00:24:45,670
Besides,

532
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:47,031
this is our little buddy

533
00:24:47,031 --> 00:24:48,551
Qingshi's first mission
from the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

534
00:24:48,551 --> 00:24:49,231
Right?

535
00:24:49,311 --> 00:24:51,031
So we must make sure
nothing will go wrong.

536
00:24:52,791 --> 00:24:53,870
It's okay, brother.

537
00:24:54,150 --> 00:24:55,150
Let Puyang

538
00:24:55,190 --> 00:24:56,190
come with us.

539
00:24:56,991 --> 00:24:58,471
Then I'll go, too.

540
00:24:58,791 --> 00:24:59,751
You can't just

541
00:24:59,751 --> 00:25:00,951
leave me behind, right?

542
00:25:03,150 --> 00:25:04,991
Fine, let's go together.

543
00:25:16,350 --> 00:25:17,991
Last time we went to the Bloodshed Tavern,

544
00:25:18,031 --> 00:25:18,951
I got dizzy and disoriented

545
00:25:18,951 --> 00:25:19,910
in the bamboo forest.

546
00:25:19,991 --> 00:25:20,630
It feels much better

547
00:25:20,630 --> 00:25:21,630
to take this path now.

548
00:25:22,311 --> 00:25:23,511
This time it's different.

549
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,870
But to find the demon,

550
00:25:24,910 --> 00:25:25,830
we still need to carefully check

551
00:25:25,830 --> 00:25:26,910
every corner here.

552
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:27,791
Yes.

553
00:25:27,870 --> 00:25:28,670
How come

554
00:25:28,670 --> 00:25:30,231
there's no one in Qinghe County?

555
00:25:30,271 --> 00:25:30,870
Let's do this.

556
00:25:31,190 --> 00:25:32,350
We'll split up and act separately.

557
00:25:32,630 --> 00:25:33,430
Be careful.

558
00:26:34,471 --> 00:26:35,350
Everyone, come here.

559
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:44,471
How's it going? Any discoveries?

560
00:26:44,590 --> 00:26:45,991
Except for spider webs and rats,

561
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:46,870
there's nothing at all.

562
00:26:49,791 --> 00:26:50,471
Xueying.

563
00:26:52,231 --> 00:26:53,471
There's something off about this room.

564
00:26:53,630 --> 00:26:54,791
It's unusually clean.

565
00:26:54,951 --> 00:26:56,311
Someone obviously frequents it.

566
00:26:56,551 --> 00:26:58,231
It's not far from the Bloodshed Tavern.

567
00:26:58,390 --> 00:26:59,910
Could it be a demon or an assassin?

568
00:27:00,311 --> 00:27:01,711
What should we do next?

569
00:27:02,031 --> 00:27:02,830
Qingshi,

570
00:27:03,110 --> 00:27:03,951
you make a plan.

571
00:27:05,991 --> 00:27:06,870
Then we will

572
00:27:07,350 --> 00:27:08,670
lie in wait.

573
00:27:31,031 --> 00:27:32,110
What are you doing?

574
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:33,150
No, no.

575
00:27:33,150 --> 00:27:34,551
I-I-I'm doing nothing.

576
00:27:34,551 --> 00:27:34,830
You...

577
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:36,511
You were the one
who threw yourself at me just now.

578
00:27:36,711 --> 00:27:37,551
Don't talk nonsense.

579
00:27:37,630 --> 00:27:37,870
It's true.

580
00:27:37,870 --> 00:27:39,150
You want me to hit you?

581
00:27:42,511 --> 00:27:43,311
Qingshi.

582
00:27:44,390 --> 00:27:45,031
What's the matter?

583
00:27:45,190 --> 00:27:45,951
You've grown up.

584
00:27:46,271 --> 00:27:47,430
You even have stubble.

585
00:27:48,430 --> 00:27:49,110
Brother,

586
00:27:49,390 --> 00:27:50,670
don't disturb a man

587
00:27:50,751 --> 00:27:51,430
when he's working.

588
00:28:02,791 --> 00:28:03,590
Something's up.

589
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:50,870
There's a hidden passage here.

590
00:28:51,951 --> 00:28:52,590
Brother,

591
00:28:54,751 --> 00:28:55,590
let me do it.

592
00:30:08,350 --> 00:30:09,071
Xueying,

593
00:30:10,231 --> 00:30:11,190
show some mercy.

594
00:30:14,190 --> 00:30:15,271
Master?

595
00:30:16,951 --> 00:30:17,711
Ms. Ye.

596
00:30:18,430 --> 00:30:19,311
If you want to kill him,

597
00:30:19,551 --> 00:30:20,390
kill me first.

598
00:30:20,670 --> 00:30:21,271
Be careful.

599
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,231
Xueying.

600
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:37,590
Ms. Ye.

601
00:30:38,511 --> 00:30:40,110
You are harboring a demon!

602
00:30:41,430 --> 00:30:43,150
He's not a demon.

603
00:30:46,590 --> 00:30:48,350
He's my love.

604
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:51,751
Hero Shan?

605
00:30:59,511 --> 00:31:02,311
Hero Shan didn't actually die.

606
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,551
(Back then, in order to eliminate demons,)

607
00:31:06,231 --> 00:31:07,110
(he went alone)

608
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,630
(into the Dark Abyss)

609
00:31:08,830 --> 00:31:10,430
(and endured torture.)

610
00:31:12,311 --> 00:31:14,071
(He barely escaped.)

611
00:31:15,951 --> 00:31:17,870
(I exhausted every method)

612
00:31:18,190 --> 00:31:19,751
(to save his life.)

613
00:31:19,870 --> 00:31:20,390
Shan.

614
00:31:22,910 --> 00:31:24,511
(But he was deeply poisoned)

615
00:31:24,830 --> 00:31:26,350
(and turned into a demon.)

616
00:31:27,670 --> 00:31:29,390
(But how could I bear)

617
00:31:30,031 --> 00:31:31,350
(to kill him?)

618
00:31:36,711 --> 00:31:37,830
So you've just been

619
00:31:37,830 --> 00:31:39,071
silently taking care of him,

620
00:31:39,511 --> 00:31:41,350
even though he's turned into a demon.

621
00:31:41,951 --> 00:31:43,870
No matter what he becomes,

622
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:47,390
he's still the man I love the most.

623
00:31:48,991 --> 00:31:50,590
Every day since then,

624
00:31:50,870 --> 00:31:51,991
my feelings for him

625
00:31:52,870 --> 00:31:54,231
have been

626
00:31:54,830 --> 00:31:57,231
both complicated and painful.

627
00:32:00,910 --> 00:32:04,231
It's time to end it.

628
00:32:09,830 --> 00:32:10,830
Let's all get out.

629
00:32:11,870 --> 00:32:12,670
Get out.

630
00:32:56,311 --> 00:32:57,350
- Lord Si An.
- Lord Si An.

631
00:32:58,271 --> 00:33:00,110
Was the mission completed smoothly?

632
00:33:03,430 --> 00:33:04,870
Where's the demon you captured?

633
00:33:09,551 --> 00:33:10,630
Lord Si An,

634
00:33:11,150 --> 00:33:13,271
there's no demon near the Qing River.

635
00:33:13,471 --> 00:33:14,870
The intel must have been wrong.

636
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:17,231
Intel wrong?

637
00:33:17,590 --> 00:33:18,711
Our intel

638
00:33:18,711 --> 00:33:19,910
has never been wrong.

639
00:33:20,190 --> 00:33:21,910
If you don't believe
in the Dragon Mountain Mansion,

640
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:23,630
there's no need to join us.

641
00:33:24,551 --> 00:33:25,791
Lord Si An, please don't be angry.

642
00:33:26,031 --> 00:33:27,630
Qingshi didn't mean that.

643
00:33:28,870 --> 00:33:30,430
But the demon we found this time

644
00:33:31,430 --> 00:33:32,630
is a bit different
from the ones we've met before.

645
00:33:34,031 --> 00:33:35,511
Well, tell me.

646
00:33:35,951 --> 00:33:37,271
What's the difference?

647
00:33:38,551 --> 00:33:39,551
Lord Si An,

648
00:33:39,870 --> 00:33:41,311
the demon you are

649
00:33:41,511 --> 00:33:42,311
looking for

650
00:33:42,311 --> 00:33:43,350
is indeed not the one
near the Qing River.

651
00:33:43,870 --> 00:33:44,630
We couldn't dig up any intel

652
00:33:44,630 --> 00:33:45,551
about that demon.

653
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:46,870
I'm willing to use other methods

654
00:33:46,991 --> 00:33:48,271
to gather intel for you.

655
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:49,551
This is not a place

656
00:33:49,551 --> 00:33:50,910
for bargaining.

657
00:33:51,630 --> 00:33:52,670
You didn't find the demon,

658
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:53,951
so the mission is considered a failure,

659
00:33:53,951 --> 00:33:55,471
and there's no second chance.

660
00:33:55,751 --> 00:33:57,430
We won't accept you.

661
00:33:57,590 --> 00:33:58,430
You can go back.

662
00:33:59,430 --> 00:34:00,471
Lord Si An,

663
00:34:00,630 --> 00:34:02,190
please give me another chance.

664
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:08,230
Is there something

665
00:34:08,551 --> 00:34:09,911
on my face?

666
00:34:14,190 --> 00:34:15,951
I think it's not just on your face.

667
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,511
In your heart

668
00:34:18,511 --> 00:34:20,270
are hidden
quite a few things too, right?

669
00:34:21,150 --> 00:34:22,790
Not only did you find

670
00:34:22,790 --> 00:34:24,750
Hero Shan who transformed into a demon,

671
00:34:26,270 --> 00:34:27,630
you also buried him

672
00:34:27,951 --> 00:34:28,911
and told me

673
00:34:28,991 --> 00:34:30,750
our intel was wrong.

674
00:34:31,270 --> 00:34:32,471
You already knew?

675
00:34:32,750 --> 00:34:34,150
Why did you lie just now?

676
00:34:34,991 --> 00:34:35,991
Every person

677
00:34:36,190 --> 00:34:38,190
has their own weaknesses
and difficulties.

678
00:34:38,630 --> 00:34:39,630
Ms. Ye Mei

679
00:34:39,750 --> 00:34:40,630
had guarded Hero Shan who was demonized

680
00:34:40,630 --> 00:34:42,031
for so many years.

681
00:34:42,230 --> 00:34:43,750
It's really not easy.

682
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,630
Besides, Hero Shan turned into a demon,

683
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,150
but he never hurt anyone.

684
00:34:49,110 --> 00:34:49,911
Now,

685
00:34:50,551 --> 00:34:51,831
he's been killed

686
00:34:52,031 --> 00:34:53,150
by Ms. Ye.

687
00:34:53,551 --> 00:34:55,031
Let's leave him there as a memento

688
00:34:55,270 --> 00:34:56,431
for her sake.

689
00:34:59,351 --> 00:35:00,351
Lord Si An,

690
00:35:01,150 --> 00:35:02,831
I'm willing to use other means

691
00:35:02,991 --> 00:35:03,831
to gather more intel

692
00:35:03,951 --> 00:35:04,790
on demons' footholds

693
00:35:04,790 --> 00:35:05,911
for you

694
00:35:06,071 --> 00:35:07,511
to make up for this loss.

695
00:35:09,991 --> 00:35:11,750
You've grown up, Qingshi.

696
00:35:13,511 --> 00:35:15,190
Actually, from the very beginning,

697
00:35:15,391 --> 00:35:17,991
I sent You Tu to supervise,

698
00:35:18,630 --> 00:35:20,391
so I could know it all.

699
00:35:21,150 --> 00:35:22,590
Although I don't fully agree

700
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,551
with you,

701
00:35:24,230 --> 00:35:25,991
you are still loyal, caring,

702
00:35:26,031 --> 00:35:27,270
brave and smart.

703
00:35:27,911 --> 00:35:28,590
Alright.

704
00:35:29,270 --> 00:35:30,110
Stay and practice

705
00:35:30,110 --> 00:35:31,310
reconnaissance spells.

706
00:35:33,790 --> 00:35:35,911
Thank you, Lord Si An.

707
00:35:36,588 --> 00:35:38,431
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

708
00:35:38,431 --> 00:35:39,270
Qingshi,

709
00:35:40,110 --> 00:35:41,790
be really careful with whatever you do

710
00:35:41,951 --> 00:35:43,150
from here on out,

711
00:35:43,551 --> 00:35:44,831
especially when it comes to your safety.

712
00:35:45,071 --> 00:35:46,471
Got it, brother.

713
00:35:47,071 --> 00:35:47,951
You said

714
00:35:48,031 --> 00:35:48,831
this before

715
00:35:48,831 --> 00:35:49,630
when we were practicing

716
00:35:49,630 --> 00:35:50,750
at my master's residence.

717
00:35:50,871 --> 00:35:52,270
Now you're repeating it.

718
00:35:53,230 --> 00:35:55,071
Did you use a spell to repeat yourself?

719
00:35:56,150 --> 00:35:56,911
It was because you were

720
00:35:56,911 --> 00:35:58,031
so mischievous and childish back then.

721
00:35:58,230 --> 00:35:59,790
If you were more mature and stable,

722
00:36:00,031 --> 00:36:01,351
I wouldn't have to
say this so many times.

723
00:36:01,471 --> 00:36:02,150
Brother,

724
00:36:02,391 --> 00:36:04,310
you sound like our mother.

725
00:36:11,991 --> 00:36:13,670
Nothing can go back to the way it was.

726
00:36:13,951 --> 00:36:15,351
Darn demons.

727
00:36:15,871 --> 00:36:16,991
One day, I will

728
00:36:17,190 --> 00:36:18,790
kill them all.

729
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,230
That day will come soon.

730
00:36:21,790 --> 00:36:22,431
Brother,

731
00:36:23,110 --> 00:36:24,230
I've already learned

732
00:36:24,391 --> 00:36:25,911
Lightning Techniques from my master.

733
00:36:26,270 --> 00:36:27,551
Now I'm in the Dragon Mountain Mansion,

734
00:36:27,551 --> 00:36:28,871
and I'll learn reconnaissance spells.

735
00:36:29,670 --> 00:36:30,310
I believe in the future,

736
00:36:30,310 --> 00:36:31,551
on the path of demon extermination,

737
00:36:31,951 --> 00:36:33,031
the two of us

738
00:36:33,230 --> 00:36:34,110
can surely defeat the demons

739
00:36:35,110 --> 00:36:36,790
by working together.

740
00:36:39,351 --> 00:36:41,511
Defeat the demons. Come on.

741
00:36:49,551 --> 00:36:50,190
Who is it?

742
00:36:52,351 --> 00:36:53,270
It's me.

743
00:36:56,391 --> 00:36:57,551
What are you here for?

744
00:36:58,230 --> 00:36:59,511
For Moyang Chen.

745
00:36:59,710 --> 00:37:01,190
What do you need from him?

746
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,951
Just tell me.

747
00:37:03,150 --> 00:37:05,071
I have learned the technique in the book

748
00:37:05,270 --> 00:37:06,590
that Moyang Chen gave me last time.

749
00:37:06,831 --> 00:37:07,790
Now I need

750
00:37:07,790 --> 00:37:09,511
more advanced demonic techniques.

751
00:37:09,871 --> 00:37:12,110
You learned it so fast?

752
00:37:15,431 --> 00:37:16,590
You're not Moyang Chen.

753
00:37:16,991 --> 00:37:18,630
Of course not.

754
00:37:18,951 --> 00:37:21,670
I'm just using this body for now.

755
00:37:22,991 --> 00:37:24,391
The remnants of the Demon God

756
00:37:24,471 --> 00:37:25,991
barely escaped death

757
00:37:26,031 --> 00:37:27,471
and are weak now.

758
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,031
I let him temporarily reside

759
00:37:29,031 --> 00:37:30,230
in Moyang Chen's body

760
00:37:30,431 --> 00:37:31,630
to recover for a while.

761
00:37:31,991 --> 00:37:33,310
When the time comes,

762
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,031
we'll rebuild his body.

763
00:37:37,551 --> 00:37:38,391
What?

764
00:37:39,750 --> 00:37:40,871
Are you afraid of anything?

765
00:37:45,190 --> 00:37:46,710
I'm willing to follow you,
Great Demon God.

766
00:37:47,031 --> 00:37:47,911
As long as...

767
00:37:47,991 --> 00:37:49,031
As long as what?

768
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:50,911
As long as

769
00:37:51,431 --> 00:37:52,871
you give me manuals

770
00:37:52,871 --> 00:37:53,871
of more advanced demonic techniques.

771
00:37:55,590 --> 00:37:57,310
You are really a cultivation fanatic.

772
00:37:57,871 --> 00:37:58,590
Okay.

773
00:38:07,831 --> 00:38:09,431
This isn't free.

774
00:38:09,951 --> 00:38:11,911
I want you to do something for me.

775
00:38:13,110 --> 00:38:13,991
What is it?

776
00:38:15,630 --> 00:38:16,951
Dongbo Xueying's Ancient Bloodline

777
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:18,790
has just been awakened,

778
00:38:19,150 --> 00:38:20,831
and his Internal Energy
is extremely unstable now.

779
00:38:21,270 --> 00:38:23,431
We will make it even worse.

780
00:38:26,031 --> 00:38:27,590
This is a potion from our clan.

781
00:38:27,871 --> 00:38:29,790
Slip some

782
00:38:30,071 --> 00:38:31,110
into his tea

783
00:38:31,110 --> 00:38:32,071
without anyone noticing.

784
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:33,951
It can provoke his Dou Qi

785
00:38:34,150 --> 00:38:36,551
and cause his Internal Energy

786
00:38:36,710 --> 00:38:37,991
to fight against itself.

787
00:38:43,391 --> 00:38:44,431
What?

788
00:38:45,190 --> 00:38:46,150
Have you developed

789
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,310
a friendship with him?

790
00:38:47,831 --> 00:38:48,871
Situ Hong,

791
00:38:49,110 --> 00:38:50,831
have you heard of the Ancient Bloodline?

792
00:38:51,031 --> 00:38:52,590
It's the strongest bloodline

793
00:38:52,670 --> 00:38:54,150
in the world.

794
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:55,710
Once his Internal Energy

795
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:57,551
stabilizes later,

796
00:38:58,230 --> 00:38:59,871
you'll be like

797
00:39:00,031 --> 00:39:01,790
a small ant in front of him.

798
00:39:01,911 --> 00:39:03,670
He just needs to lift a finger

799
00:39:03,911 --> 00:39:05,670
to knock you down.

800
00:39:08,071 --> 00:39:09,310
After this is done,

801
00:39:09,750 --> 00:39:11,031
I want

802
00:39:11,031 --> 00:39:12,150
even more advanced demonic techniques.

803
00:39:13,150 --> 00:39:14,391
Situ Hong,

804
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,911
you're the one I value the most.

805
00:39:18,630 --> 00:39:19,911
I will spare no effort

806
00:39:19,911 --> 00:39:20,750
to turn you into the strongest one

807
00:39:20,750 --> 00:39:22,590
in the Dragon Mountain Empire.

808
00:39:22,911 --> 00:39:24,750
As long as you're loyal to me,

809
00:39:25,431 --> 00:39:27,790
in the future,
the Dragon Mountain Empire will be ours

810
00:39:28,630 --> 00:39:29,951
and also yours.

811
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:56,911
I didn't expect

812
00:39:57,150 --> 00:39:59,110
just some demonic techniques

813
00:39:59,110 --> 00:40:00,511
could make him our obedient servant.

814
00:40:00,831 --> 00:40:02,790
He is fundamentally different

815
00:40:02,790 --> 00:40:04,031
from you and me.

816
00:40:04,230 --> 00:40:06,590
We were born as demons.

817
00:40:06,790 --> 00:40:09,630
Situ Hong is a human
from the Xia Clan after all.

818
00:40:10,031 --> 00:40:11,670
He joined us

819
00:40:11,831 --> 00:40:13,351
just to

820
00:40:13,351 --> 00:40:14,951
get higher-level techniques.

821
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,790
Don't disclose our secrets

822
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:18,831
to him.

823
00:40:18,871 --> 00:40:19,511
Understood.

824
00:40:20,150 --> 00:40:21,511
He's the kind of man

825
00:40:22,150 --> 00:40:23,391
who would betray his sect

826
00:40:23,391 --> 00:40:25,071
for demonic techniques.

827
00:40:25,630 --> 00:40:27,911
We can't guarantee
that he won't betray us

828
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:29,670
for the same reason in the future.

829
00:40:29,750 --> 00:40:30,831
But for now,

830
00:40:30,831 --> 00:40:32,670
he's still under our control.

831
00:40:33,071 --> 00:40:35,630
We need to make the best use

832
00:40:35,951 --> 00:40:39,031
of the pawn.

833
00:40:39,590 --> 00:40:40,150
Yes.

834
00:40:46,750 --> 00:40:47,471
Xueying.

835
00:40:47,750 --> 00:40:48,951
I'm practicing now.

836
00:40:48,951 --> 00:40:50,110
I can't spar with you.

837
00:40:51,431 --> 00:40:53,270
I didn't come to spar with you.

838
00:40:54,190 --> 00:40:55,391
I came to apologize

839
00:40:55,391 --> 00:40:56,230
to you and Jingqiu.

840
00:40:57,230 --> 00:40:58,071
To apologize?

841
00:40:59,110 --> 00:41:00,150
I really didn't know

842
00:41:00,150 --> 00:41:01,590
the crystal given

843
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:02,670
to Jingqiu

844
00:41:03,031 --> 00:41:04,551
was a demonic one beforehand.

845
00:41:04,911 --> 00:41:06,230
I don't know how that demonic item

846
00:41:06,230 --> 00:41:07,511
ended up on me.

847
00:41:07,630 --> 00:41:08,351
Perhaps,

848
00:41:08,871 --> 00:41:10,150
it was switched by someone.

849
00:41:10,911 --> 00:41:12,150
But at the end of the day,

850
00:41:12,310 --> 00:41:13,750
it's on me.

851
00:41:14,270 --> 00:41:16,551
I caused the awakening
of Miss Jingqiu's divine bloodline

852
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:18,471
and made her suffer so much.

853
00:41:18,710 --> 00:41:19,351
You didn't know

854
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,471
that was from the Demon Clan?

855
00:41:21,471 --> 00:41:22,270
No,

856
00:41:22,911 --> 00:41:24,071
I swear I didn't.

857
00:41:24,831 --> 00:41:26,071
If I had known,

858
00:41:26,071 --> 00:41:26,951
how could I possibly

859
00:41:27,031 --> 00:41:28,351
give the demonic item

860
00:41:28,511 --> 00:41:29,710
to Miss Jingqiu?

861
00:41:31,590 --> 00:41:32,750
I need to continue my practice.

862
00:41:32,911 --> 00:41:33,590
Please leave.

863
00:41:36,031 --> 00:41:36,790
Xueying,

864
00:41:37,871 --> 00:41:39,590
I know you're still angry with me.

865
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:41,551
But you know me.

866
00:41:41,710 --> 00:41:42,590
How could I possibly harm

867
00:41:42,590 --> 00:41:44,150
Miss Jingqiu?

868
00:41:45,310 --> 00:41:47,190
But her divine bloodline has awakened.

869
00:41:48,150 --> 00:41:49,951
It can be considered
a blessing in disguise.

870
00:42:01,710 --> 00:42:03,031
Your Ancient Bloodline

871
00:42:03,031 --> 00:42:04,031
has just awakened.

872
00:42:04,551 --> 00:42:05,911
In the future, when you practice,

873
00:42:06,391 --> 00:42:07,831
make sure to have enough rest.

874
00:42:08,511 --> 00:42:09,351
If there's anything

875
00:42:09,351 --> 00:42:10,391
I can do,

876
00:42:11,310 --> 00:42:12,391
