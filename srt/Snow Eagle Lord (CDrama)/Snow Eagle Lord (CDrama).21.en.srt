(Si Mansion)

22
00:01:54,394 --> 00:01:55,194
Today,

23
00:01:55,354 --> 00:01:56,474
I might have been

24
00:01:56,474 --> 00:01:57,834
too harsh on Hong.

25
00:01:59,114 --> 00:02:01,075
I just want him to succeed.

26
00:02:01,435 --> 00:02:01,994
(Your Lordship,)

27
00:02:01,994 --> 00:02:03,315
(your attitude towards Situ Hong)

28
00:02:03,315 --> 00:02:04,315
(and Si Borong)

29
00:02:04,315 --> 00:02:05,394
(is really different.)

30
00:02:05,875 --> 00:02:06,914
What's different?

31
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,715
Borong's abilities are average,

32
00:02:08,715 --> 00:02:09,794
and he just knows how to showboat.

33
00:02:09,794 --> 00:02:10,794
You're very lenient with him.

34
00:02:10,794 --> 00:02:11,435
Situ Hong

35
00:02:11,435 --> 00:02:12,595
trains harder

36
00:02:12,595 --> 00:02:13,674
and has stronger martial arts skills.

37
00:02:13,954 --> 00:02:15,595
But you're even stricter with him.

38
00:02:15,754 --> 00:02:17,194
You noticed that, huh?

39
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:19,835
Borong is playful,

40
00:02:19,835 --> 00:02:21,115
and his martial arts foundation is weak.

41
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,875
He's not interested in it.

42
00:02:22,954 --> 00:02:25,035
Just let him be happy.

43
00:02:25,315 --> 00:02:27,035
If we push him too hard,

44
00:02:27,035 --> 00:02:28,954
it could backfire.

45
00:02:30,474 --> 00:02:32,074
As for Situ Hong,

46
00:02:32,074 --> 00:02:33,794
he has exceptional talent
in martial arts.

47
00:02:34,155 --> 00:02:35,514
He trains diligently

48
00:02:35,514 --> 00:02:36,595
and never slacks off.

49
00:02:36,754 --> 00:02:37,914
That's why

50
00:02:37,914 --> 00:02:39,875
I need to focus more on cultivating him,

51
00:02:40,074 --> 00:02:41,995
helping him reach higher levels

52
00:02:42,234 --> 00:02:44,074
and perhaps even surpass me.

53
00:02:47,514 --> 00:02:49,474
One day, he will understand

54
00:02:49,474 --> 00:02:51,595
my good intentions for him.

55
00:03:13,112 --> 00:03:14,168
(Vanishing Technique)

56
00:03:21,514 --> 00:03:22,715
You're a good-for-nothing

57
00:03:22,715 --> 00:03:24,234
and have brought shame to our family.

58
00:03:24,354 --> 00:03:24,794
And now,

59
00:03:24,794 --> 00:03:26,634
you're even stealing
something from the house!

60
00:03:29,954 --> 00:03:30,954
You ungrateful brat!

61
00:03:30,954 --> 00:03:32,835
Let me teach you a lesson.

62
00:03:36,435 --> 00:03:37,234
Aunt.

63
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,035
You're not Chi Qiubai.

64
00:03:45,514 --> 00:03:46,155
Well.

65
00:03:46,514 --> 00:03:47,634
Don't I look like him?

66
00:03:49,194 --> 00:03:50,595
Si Lianghong was once

67
00:03:50,595 --> 00:03:52,194
the vanguard general
in the great battle.

68
00:03:52,514 --> 00:03:53,835
Although

69
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:54,995
in the Nanqin Demon Well incident,

70
00:03:55,035 --> 00:03:56,555
she used up much of her energy

71
00:03:56,715 --> 00:03:58,035
to fill the cracks.

72
00:03:58,674 --> 00:03:59,715
Even so,

73
00:04:00,115 --> 00:04:01,995
it's not that easy to kill her

74
00:04:02,555 --> 00:04:04,115
with your ability.

75
00:04:04,754 --> 00:04:06,514
Is she that powerful?

76
00:04:08,674 --> 00:04:10,794
Even though you've practiced
demonic techniques,

77
00:04:11,354 --> 00:04:13,194
it can't guarantee you'll kill her.

78
00:04:13,595 --> 00:04:14,794
And what I want

79
00:04:15,435 --> 00:04:17,354
is a foolproof way.

80
00:04:18,874 --> 00:04:20,035
What should I do?

81
00:04:20,354 --> 00:04:22,114
I'll disguise you as Chi Qiubai.

82
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:24,035
Chi Qiubai.

83
00:04:24,314 --> 00:04:24,914
Only when she is

84
00:04:24,914 --> 00:04:26,314
extremely weak

85
00:04:26,674 --> 00:04:28,354
will she let her guard down.

86
00:04:28,755 --> 00:04:30,715
Seize the opportunity
and kill her with one blow.

87
00:04:31,275 --> 00:04:32,515
You know what to do.

88
00:04:36,635 --> 00:04:37,395
Moyang Chen!

89
00:04:49,914 --> 00:04:51,075
I'll give you the manual
of the Vanishing Technique.

90
00:04:51,075 --> 00:04:52,234
Please spare my aunt.

91
00:04:53,994 --> 00:04:55,835
You traitor!

92
00:04:59,075 --> 00:04:59,635
Okay.

93
00:04:59,994 --> 00:05:01,474
I'll help you

94
00:05:01,674 --> 00:05:03,354
as promised.

95
00:05:19,635 --> 00:05:21,275
The master's manual

96
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,914
should be kept by you.

97
00:05:26,794 --> 00:05:27,755
Hong.

98
00:05:34,075 --> 00:05:35,554
Test your skills.

99
00:05:36,234 --> 00:05:37,515
After dealing with her,

100
00:05:37,874 --> 00:05:39,354
everything will be yours.

101
00:05:57,674 --> 00:05:58,835
Don't!

102
00:06:01,794 --> 00:06:02,755
Hong.

103
00:06:19,554 --> 00:06:20,395
Aunt.

104
00:06:22,914 --> 00:06:23,794
Aunt.

105
00:06:24,314 --> 00:06:25,395
Someone!

106
00:06:25,554 --> 00:06:26,835
Someone!

107
00:06:27,434 --> 00:06:28,234
Aunt.

108
00:06:28,234 --> 00:06:29,674
Aunt, you'll be fine.

109
00:06:29,674 --> 00:06:30,395
You'll be fine.

110
00:06:32,155 --> 00:06:33,114
Knight Changfeng.

111
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,314
Murder!

112
00:06:41,314 --> 00:06:43,314
Chi Qiubai killed Lord Si Lianghong!

113
00:06:43,314 --> 00:06:44,515
Murder!

114
00:06:56,715 --> 00:06:58,314
(If I had been a little faster,)

115
00:06:58,955 --> 00:07:00,874
(I could have caught up with him then.)

116
00:07:01,515 --> 00:07:02,434
Xueying,

117
00:07:04,314 --> 00:07:05,515
have you seen Master?

118
00:07:06,035 --> 00:07:06,674
No,

119
00:07:06,674 --> 00:07:07,835
I haven't seen him lately.

120
00:07:07,955 --> 00:07:09,314
Lord Si Lianghong of Nanqin City

121
00:07:09,314 --> 00:07:10,035
was murdered.

122
00:07:10,035 --> 00:07:11,835
They say she was having
a secret meeting with Master

123
00:07:11,835 --> 00:07:13,755
and that they were discussing
spatial techniques

124
00:07:13,755 --> 00:07:14,994
when Master suddenly attacked

125
00:07:14,994 --> 00:07:15,955
and killed Lord Si Lianghong.

126
00:07:15,955 --> 00:07:16,554
What?

127
00:07:16,994 --> 00:07:17,835
What did you say?

128
00:07:18,354 --> 00:07:20,234
And someone from the Si Mansion

129
00:07:20,434 --> 00:07:22,035
said he saw it happen.

130
00:07:22,395 --> 00:07:23,395
Just now, the Elders of the council

131
00:07:23,395 --> 00:07:24,715
came to the academy
looking for the dean,

132
00:07:24,715 --> 00:07:26,075
but my master
said the dean had been away

133
00:07:26,075 --> 00:07:26,955
from the academy these days

134
00:07:26,955 --> 00:07:28,114
and left matters to him.

135
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,395
Now it's even more difficult
to clear things up.

136
00:07:30,354 --> 00:07:31,195
Master couldn't have done

137
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:32,155
such a thing.

138
00:07:32,515 --> 00:07:33,955
I'm going to Nanqin City now.

139
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:35,395
We'll go with you.

140
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,314
Master definitely wouldn't do this.

141
00:07:37,314 --> 00:07:39,075
Let's go and find a solution together.

142
00:07:39,275 --> 00:07:39,794
Let's go.

143
00:07:42,755 --> 00:07:43,515
Qingshi.

144
00:07:45,195 --> 00:07:46,075
Qingshi.

145
00:08:42,275 --> 00:08:43,314
- Miss Ji Rong.
- Miss Ji Rong.

146
00:08:45,074 --> 00:08:46,355
I sprained my ankle.

147
00:08:46,355 --> 00:08:47,635
Can you get me a doctor?

148
00:08:48,434 --> 00:08:48,954
Yes.

149
00:08:51,714 --> 00:08:53,115
It hurts so much.

150
00:08:53,515 --> 00:08:54,115
Miss,

151
00:08:54,314 --> 00:08:56,314
my family has
an ancestral massage technique

152
00:08:56,314 --> 00:08:57,594
specially for bruises and sprains.

153
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:58,554
Do you want me

154
00:08:58,674 --> 00:08:59,914
to massage your foot?

155
00:09:00,755 --> 00:09:02,155
Come over and do it for me now.

156
00:09:02,515 --> 00:09:03,074
Alright.

157
00:09:09,954 --> 00:09:12,275
You're too gentle.

158
00:09:23,674 --> 00:09:24,834
Help!

159
00:09:24,834 --> 00:09:26,755
Help! Someone!

160
00:09:27,275 --> 00:09:27,755
Help!

161
00:09:27,755 --> 00:09:28,554
Rong.

162
00:09:28,714 --> 00:09:29,554
Help!

163
00:09:29,714 --> 00:09:31,275
Is there anyone?

164
00:09:33,954 --> 00:09:34,714
Rong.

165
00:09:36,554 --> 00:09:37,875
Rong, how are you?

166
00:09:38,115 --> 00:09:39,115
Where are you hurt?

167
00:09:39,755 --> 00:09:41,235
I'm fine, Qingshi.

168
00:09:41,875 --> 00:09:43,475
I didn't expect him to do this.

169
00:09:44,714 --> 00:09:45,235
Let's go.

170
00:09:45,515 --> 00:09:46,355
I'll take you home.

171
00:09:46,794 --> 00:09:47,275
Go.

172
00:09:53,641 --> 00:09:56,056
(Si Mansion)

173
00:09:56,995 --> 00:09:58,355
Please help

174
00:09:59,115 --> 00:10:00,235
get justice

175
00:10:01,194 --> 00:10:02,434
for my family.

176
00:10:05,875 --> 00:10:06,714
Is there any news

177
00:10:06,714 --> 00:10:08,194
about Chi Qiubai's whereabouts?

178
00:10:09,395 --> 00:10:10,755
I have given the order
to search for him.

179
00:10:10,794 --> 00:10:11,275
But

180
00:10:11,395 --> 00:10:12,714
there's been no news.

181
00:10:12,714 --> 00:10:14,594
How could Chi Qiubai

182
00:10:15,155 --> 00:10:16,115
do a cold-blooded thing

183
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:18,115
like that?

184
00:10:18,275 --> 00:10:18,875
He's a disgrace

185
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:20,594
to every Transcendent cultivator!

186
00:10:23,355 --> 00:10:24,314
We can't just jump

187
00:10:24,395 --> 00:10:25,035
to conclusions

188
00:10:25,035 --> 00:10:26,194
about how Si Lianghong died.

189
00:10:26,674 --> 00:10:27,674
Sikong Yang,

190
00:10:28,194 --> 00:10:30,155
are they the kind of disciplines

191
00:10:30,594 --> 00:10:32,115
your temple cultivates?

192
00:10:32,594 --> 00:10:33,355
Xueying,

193
00:10:33,554 --> 00:10:34,954
any new information?

194
00:10:35,594 --> 00:10:36,594
Everyone,

195
00:10:36,594 --> 00:10:37,235
we just found

196
00:10:37,235 --> 00:10:38,355
a memory bubble

197
00:10:38,355 --> 00:10:39,714
in Lord Si's room.

198
00:10:55,554 --> 00:10:56,314
Jingqiu,

199
00:10:57,395 --> 00:10:58,554
just like you,

200
00:10:58,635 --> 00:10:59,475
I am unwilling to believe

201
00:10:59,475 --> 00:11:01,115
it was done by our master.

202
00:11:02,475 --> 00:11:04,395
But my aunt has been so kind to me.

203
00:11:04,875 --> 00:11:06,714
I can't be biased because of this.

204
00:11:07,074 --> 00:11:07,954
Situ Hong,

205
00:11:08,355 --> 00:11:09,755
we'll know if it was our master's doing

206
00:11:10,035 --> 00:11:10,875
once we see it.

207
00:11:11,115 --> 00:11:12,074
The origin

208
00:11:12,074 --> 00:11:13,875
of this memory bubble is unclear.

209
00:11:14,115 --> 00:11:15,275
What if it was placed

210
00:11:15,275 --> 00:11:16,755
by the real culprit in my aunt's room

211
00:11:16,914 --> 00:11:18,314
to confuse us?

212
00:11:18,314 --> 00:11:19,434
Let him show it.

213
00:11:19,794 --> 00:11:21,194
We will judge

214
00:11:21,194 --> 00:11:22,554
whether it's true or not by ourselves.

215
00:11:42,755 --> 00:11:43,914
It was not Qiubai.

216
00:11:44,115 --> 00:11:44,954
Another person

217
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:46,035
killed Si Lianghong.

218
00:11:47,834 --> 00:11:49,395
Can you recognize who this person is?

219
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:51,155
With a silhouette alone,

220
00:11:51,875 --> 00:11:53,074
it's hard for me to tell.

221
00:11:53,434 --> 00:11:54,434
But at least

222
00:11:54,434 --> 00:11:55,235
we can confirm now

223
00:11:55,434 --> 00:11:56,434
Lord Si's death

224
00:11:56,635 --> 00:11:58,194
was not done by our master.

225
00:11:58,674 --> 00:11:59,794
Though the murderer

226
00:11:59,794 --> 00:12:00,674
was not Chi Qiubai,

227
00:12:00,834 --> 00:12:01,714
he still played

228
00:12:01,714 --> 00:12:02,834
the role of an accomplice.

229
00:12:03,235 --> 00:12:04,074
I will investigate

230
00:12:04,475 --> 00:12:05,995
this matter to the end.

231
00:12:07,275 --> 00:12:08,995
If the accomplice is really our master,

232
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,155
he must be in Nanqin City now.

233
00:12:11,515 --> 00:12:12,674
Let's go find him.

234
00:12:13,074 --> 00:12:14,355
Then everything will be clear.

235
00:12:39,794 --> 00:12:41,235
Why did we come
to the Xueying Territory?

236
00:12:41,794 --> 00:12:42,635
I warned you

237
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:45,995
not to target Xueying.

238
00:12:46,395 --> 00:12:47,954
Since I promised you before

239
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:49,395
not to hurt him,

240
00:12:50,035 --> 00:12:51,475
I won't go back on my word.

241
00:12:52,714 --> 00:12:53,954
I'm asking you for help today.

242
00:12:53,954 --> 00:12:55,834
It has nothing to do

243
00:12:56,395 --> 00:12:57,954
with Dongbo Xueying.

244
00:13:01,194 --> 00:13:01,635
I need you

245
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:03,554
to enhance the power
of this source stone

246
00:13:03,554 --> 00:13:04,235
and make it appear

247
00:13:04,235 --> 00:13:05,395
where it should be.

248
00:13:12,914 --> 00:13:13,834
What are you going to do?

249
00:13:14,035 --> 00:13:15,954
It's just a small source stone.

250
00:13:16,355 --> 00:13:18,035
You don't need to be so nervous.

251
00:13:18,714 --> 00:13:19,954
And did you forget?

252
00:13:20,554 --> 00:13:21,554
It was you who came to me

253
00:13:21,554 --> 00:13:23,035
to take Dongbo Xueying's place.

254
00:13:23,995 --> 00:13:25,794
Of course, it's not too late
to back out now.

255
00:13:26,035 --> 00:13:26,594
I can catch

256
00:13:26,594 --> 00:13:28,155
Dongbo Xueying back

257
00:13:28,515 --> 00:13:29,434
and let him do it.

258
00:14:17,355 --> 00:14:19,115
This is the key to the secret passage
in the back mountain.

259
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:20,794
It's located in Dongbo Lie's tomb.

260
00:14:21,594 --> 00:14:22,395
Very good.

261
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:23,875
You must find a way

262
00:14:23,875 --> 00:14:24,635
to stall them tomorrow.

263
00:14:24,914 --> 00:14:25,594
Don't let them

264
00:14:25,594 --> 00:14:26,594
ruin our plans.

265
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,155
Yes, Third Priest.

266
00:14:35,064 --> 00:14:40,952
(Xueying Territory)

267
00:14:47,914 --> 00:14:48,875
Who's on duty?

268
00:14:49,594 --> 00:14:50,395
Commander Zong,

269
00:14:50,594 --> 00:14:51,155
you're back.

270
00:14:51,155 --> 00:14:51,995
Why are there so few guards

271
00:14:51,995 --> 00:14:52,834
on duty?

272
00:14:53,155 --> 00:14:54,515
I've only been away for a few days.

273
00:14:54,515 --> 00:14:55,714
How could you become so lax?

274
00:14:55,714 --> 00:14:56,794
Something's happened these days.

275
00:15:02,755 --> 00:15:03,475
Do your job well.

276
00:15:03,475 --> 00:15:04,235
- Yes.
- Yes.

277
00:15:04,235 --> 00:15:05,074
Hurry, hurry.

278
00:15:06,035 --> 00:15:06,714
Be more diligent.

279
00:15:06,755 --> 00:15:07,314
Alright.

280
00:15:08,194 --> 00:15:08,995
Commander Zong.

281
00:15:09,235 --> 00:15:09,914
Commander Zong.

282
00:15:10,794 --> 00:15:11,875
Miss Ji Rong,

283
00:15:12,834 --> 00:15:14,235
I heard about today's incident.

284
00:15:14,235 --> 00:15:15,434
I'm really sorry

285
00:15:15,434 --> 00:15:16,314
that my guard offended you.

286
00:15:16,954 --> 00:15:18,515
It's all in the past. It's fine.

287
00:15:20,194 --> 00:15:21,194
Miss Ji Rong,

288
00:15:22,475 --> 00:15:23,875
where are you going so late at night?

289
00:15:25,594 --> 00:15:26,635
I can't sleep,

290
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:28,035
so I came out for some fresh air

291
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,314
and by the way, to check on Qingshi.

292
00:15:30,314 --> 00:15:31,235
I hear

293
00:15:31,235 --> 00:15:32,594
he's still practicing outside so late.

294
00:15:33,875 --> 00:15:34,954
Uncle Zong Ling,

295
00:15:35,194 --> 00:15:36,475
I'm not feeling well.

296
00:15:36,475 --> 00:15:37,515
I'm going back.

297
00:15:50,755 --> 00:15:51,635
Rong?

298
00:15:55,515 --> 00:15:56,235
Why don't you rest

299
00:15:56,235 --> 00:15:57,074
in your room?

300
00:15:57,074 --> 00:15:58,035
I'll bring you breakfast

301
00:15:58,035 --> 00:15:58,635
later.

302
00:15:58,714 --> 00:15:59,395
Come.

303
00:15:59,395 --> 00:15:59,995
Come sit down.

304
00:16:01,395 --> 00:16:02,834
I'm not that delicate.

305
00:16:02,995 --> 00:16:03,755
Besides,

306
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,914
doing something else

307
00:16:04,914 --> 00:16:06,194
is a good way to distract myself.

308
00:16:06,194 --> 00:16:07,954
Distracting yourself is predicated

309
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:10,275
on having a good breakfast.

310
00:16:16,035 --> 00:16:17,314
What's the matter?

311
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:18,755
Well...

312
00:16:19,635 --> 00:16:20,594
There are no outsiders.

313
00:16:20,755 --> 00:16:21,355
Just say it.

314
00:16:23,914 --> 00:16:24,794
Someone reports

315
00:16:24,794 --> 00:16:25,674
that there's a ghost
haunting the farmhouse.

316
00:16:25,755 --> 00:16:27,235
The tenants are afraid
to leave their homes,

317
00:16:27,235 --> 00:16:28,155
and complaints are everywhere.

318
00:16:28,355 --> 00:16:29,794
Our people can't control it,

319
00:16:29,954 --> 00:16:31,794
and they hope we can help.

320
00:16:32,275 --> 00:16:33,395
A ghost?

321
00:16:34,395 --> 00:16:36,475
I think it's just someone
who has ulterior motives.

322
00:16:36,755 --> 00:16:37,355
Well,

323
00:16:37,554 --> 00:16:38,714
I'll send them away.

324
00:16:39,395 --> 00:16:39,995
Wait a moment.

325
00:16:42,515 --> 00:16:43,635
Although

326
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:44,554
it's a small matter for us,

327
00:16:45,155 --> 00:16:45,594
for those farmers,

328
00:16:45,594 --> 00:16:46,954
it is

329
00:16:46,954 --> 00:16:48,235
a big deal.

330
00:16:48,355 --> 00:16:48,954
We absolutely cannot

331
00:16:48,954 --> 00:16:50,314
refuse them so forcefully.

332
00:16:50,674 --> 00:16:51,755
Otherwise, everyone will think

333
00:16:51,755 --> 00:16:53,434
that Qingshi is a cold-hearted person.

334
00:16:55,515 --> 00:16:57,714
Sending people to guard the farmstead

335
00:16:58,074 --> 00:17:00,035
will not only reassure the people

336
00:17:00,194 --> 00:17:02,035
but also establish Qingshi's authority.

337
00:17:02,434 --> 00:17:03,475
Why not do it?

338
00:17:03,914 --> 00:17:05,035
Ji Rong makes sense.

339
00:17:05,594 --> 00:17:07,314
But our manpower...

340
00:17:07,314 --> 00:17:08,074
Uncle Tong San,

341
00:17:08,195 --> 00:17:09,515
let's settle this matter like this.

342
00:17:09,715 --> 00:17:10,394
Is that okay?

343
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:16,235
Alright,

344
00:17:16,915 --> 00:17:18,074
let's do as Shi says.

345
00:17:18,074 --> 00:17:18,715
Go ahead.

346
00:17:20,515 --> 00:17:22,154
Yes, I'll go and do it right away.

347
00:17:27,955 --> 00:17:28,675
How is it?

348
00:18:15,834 --> 00:18:16,955
You also feel something's off.

349
00:18:22,314 --> 00:18:23,154
Master Sikong,

350
00:18:23,314 --> 00:18:24,275
what happened?

351
00:18:24,554 --> 00:18:26,275
The Demon Clan is going
to seize the Demon Well.

352
00:18:27,154 --> 00:18:28,995
A great battle between the Xia Clan
and the Demon Clan is imminent.

353
00:18:29,195 --> 00:18:30,354
You must be prepared.

354
00:19:04,314 --> 00:19:05,354
Moyang Chen.

355
00:19:16,074 --> 00:19:17,354
The Vanishing Technique.

356
00:19:19,995 --> 00:19:20,995
The Vanishing Technique

357
00:19:21,154 --> 00:19:22,394
is exclusive to the Si Family.

358
00:19:22,554 --> 00:19:23,634
It won't be shared outside.

359
00:19:32,314 --> 00:19:33,074
Tell me.

360
00:19:33,394 --> 00:19:34,435
Does your family

361
00:19:34,475 --> 00:19:36,195
have secret connections
with the Demon Clan?

362
00:19:36,394 --> 00:19:37,114
No,

363
00:19:38,195 --> 00:19:38,915
absolutely not.

364
00:19:39,114 --> 00:19:40,394
Then where did Moyang Chen

365
00:19:40,794 --> 00:19:42,594
learn the Vanishing Technique?

366
00:19:42,955 --> 00:19:43,794
I remember now.

367
00:19:43,995 --> 00:19:44,995
On the day my aunt died,

368
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:46,995
someone sneaked into our mansion.

369
00:19:46,995 --> 00:19:48,195
At that time, our mansion was in chaos,

370
00:19:48,275 --> 00:19:49,874
and we had no time to deal with it.

371
00:19:50,394 --> 00:19:51,154
I guess

372
00:19:51,515 --> 00:19:52,755
that person must be Moyang Chen.

373
00:19:53,074 --> 00:19:54,035
He took advantage of the chaos

374
00:19:54,594 --> 00:19:56,235
and stole the manual
of the Vanishing Technique.

375
00:19:56,834 --> 00:19:58,035
Is this true?

376
00:19:59,195 --> 00:20:00,554
My family is loyal and righteous.

377
00:20:00,554 --> 00:20:02,114
We would never collude
with the Demon Clan,

378
00:20:02,114 --> 00:20:03,554
and we would never betray the Xia Clan.

379
00:20:04,634 --> 00:20:06,554
Even though you don't betray,

380
00:20:06,834 --> 00:20:08,675
you can't shirk the responsibility

381
00:20:08,755 --> 00:20:10,394
of being negligent in your duties.

382
00:20:10,515 --> 00:20:11,515
I am incompetent.

383
00:20:11,995 --> 00:20:13,435
I would like to stay in the Si Mansion

384
00:20:13,715 --> 00:20:14,915
and reflect on my mistakes.

385
00:20:15,435 --> 00:20:17,354
My aunt and cousin just passed away.

386
00:20:18,354 --> 00:20:20,314
I want to stay and rebuild my family

387
00:20:21,515 --> 00:20:23,035
so that my aunt and cousin

388
00:20:23,834 --> 00:20:24,874
can rest in peace.

389
00:20:32,755 --> 00:20:34,515
Is the ghost problem resolved?

390
00:20:34,715 --> 00:20:36,275
It's resolved. There's no ghost.

391
00:20:36,475 --> 00:20:37,755
It's just someone
causing trouble on purpose.

392
00:20:38,235 --> 00:20:39,154
Where is that person?

393
00:20:39,354 --> 00:20:40,515
Did you catch him?

394
00:20:40,794 --> 00:20:41,634
No, we didn't.

395
00:20:41,715 --> 00:20:43,114
I guess

396
00:20:43,114 --> 00:20:44,114
it's a neighborhood dispute
between villagers.

397
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:47,715
Since the matter is resolved,

398
00:20:47,995 --> 00:20:49,755
why not reward the soldiers?

399
00:20:50,634 --> 00:20:52,394
The people are grateful to Qingshi.

400
00:20:52,394 --> 00:20:53,475
It helps him build up good fame.

401
00:20:53,874 --> 00:20:55,794
Qingshi rewards the soldiers.

402
00:20:55,794 --> 00:20:56,915
It helps him establish authority,

403
00:20:57,634 --> 00:20:59,515
and it can also boost morale.

404
00:20:59,675 --> 00:21:00,794
Three benefits in one move.

405
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,915
Well said. Three benefits in one move.

406
00:21:03,915 --> 00:21:04,915
Then today,

407
00:21:04,915 --> 00:21:06,834
let's treat the soldiers well.

408
00:21:06,955 --> 00:21:07,874
Pass the order down.

409
00:21:08,235 --> 00:21:08,915
Yes.

410
00:21:14,715 --> 00:21:15,314
How is it?

411
00:21:15,314 --> 00:21:16,594
Is the tea I brewed good?

412
00:21:16,915 --> 00:21:17,874
Very good.

413
00:21:18,275 --> 00:21:19,275
Then drink some more.

414
00:22:12,594 --> 00:22:13,515
Come on.

415
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:07,634
Knight Changfeng,

416
00:24:08,354 --> 00:24:09,634
it's up to you now.

417
00:24:14,394 --> 00:24:16,035
The location of the second Demon Well

418
00:24:16,035 --> 00:24:16,834
is found.

419
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:19,195
The rare source stone is now in hand.

420
00:24:19,435 --> 00:24:20,435
But with only the power

421
00:24:20,435 --> 00:24:21,715
of the useless Black Armored Warriors,

422
00:24:21,715 --> 00:24:22,794
it's far from enough.

423
00:24:23,035 --> 00:24:23,834
The Demon Well

424
00:24:23,834 --> 00:24:25,755
is not so easy to break through.

425
00:24:25,755 --> 00:24:27,394
We must absorb and compress

426
00:24:27,394 --> 00:24:28,995
immense power

427
00:24:28,995 --> 00:24:31,955
to achieve the momentum
of thunderbolt penetration.

428
00:24:33,275 --> 00:24:34,435
What should we do?

429
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:36,074
It's time for Chi Qiubai to do something

430
00:24:36,074 --> 00:24:37,035
for us.

431
00:24:37,435 --> 00:24:38,314
The rare source stone

432
00:24:38,314 --> 00:24:40,195
has extremely strong material energy.

433
00:24:40,195 --> 00:24:42,314
Let's combine it

434
00:24:42,314 --> 00:24:43,275
with the formidable energy

435
00:24:43,275 --> 00:24:44,435
within Chi Qiubai's body

436
00:24:44,435 --> 00:24:45,394
and then sacrifice

437
00:24:45,394 --> 00:24:47,314
the combination

438
00:24:47,314 --> 00:24:49,594
to the Demon Well.

439
00:24:51,675 --> 00:24:52,955
What exactly are you going to do?

440
00:24:52,955 --> 00:24:54,195
No need to ask.

441
00:24:54,794 --> 00:24:56,275
Just do as I instruct.

442
00:24:56,675 --> 00:24:58,035
Then I can't obey.

443
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:04,195
Chi Qiubai,

444
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:06,834
unless you have the Ancient Bloodline.

445
00:25:07,195 --> 00:25:07,874
Otherwise,

446
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:09,834
the Soul Scouring Nail
will mess up your meridians,

447
00:25:10,114 --> 00:25:11,955
turning you
into someone totally unrecognizable.

448
00:25:13,475 --> 00:25:15,394
Of course, if you're obedient,

449
00:25:15,874 --> 00:25:17,275
your pain might not be so bad.

450
00:25:19,314 --> 00:25:21,035
I will never do anything

451
00:25:21,594 --> 00:25:23,354
harmful to the Xia Clan.

452
00:25:25,874 --> 00:25:27,195
I want to know

453
00:25:27,235 --> 00:25:28,874
what makes you

454
00:25:28,874 --> 00:25:30,154
so loyal to the Xia Clan.

455
00:25:31,074 --> 00:25:32,354
Is it faith?

456
00:25:32,995 --> 00:25:35,675
Faith is meant to collapse.

457
00:25:41,554 --> 00:25:43,035
You think these demon soldiers

458
00:25:43,275 --> 00:25:44,874
can kill me?

459
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:03,755
Shi,

460
00:26:04,035 --> 00:26:05,235
I just felt some trembling

461
00:26:05,235 --> 00:26:06,074
outside the fort.

462
00:26:06,154 --> 00:26:07,114
I'll go take a look.

463
00:26:07,475 --> 00:26:08,114
Really?

464
00:26:08,114 --> 00:26:08,515
Alright.

465
00:26:09,035 --> 00:26:09,834
Qingshi,

466
00:26:09,834 --> 00:26:11,195
did you feel the shake?

467
00:26:12,715 --> 00:26:14,314
No, Uncle Zong.

468
00:26:14,515 --> 00:26:16,114
Maybe you're too happy today,

469
00:26:16,154 --> 00:26:17,314
and you're mistaken.

470
00:26:17,554 --> 00:26:18,195
No.

471
00:26:18,955 --> 00:26:20,634
The Demon Clan is rampant.

472
00:26:20,915 --> 00:26:21,995
It's better to be careful.

473
00:26:21,995 --> 00:26:22,675
I'll go for a moment.

474
00:26:22,955 --> 00:26:24,035
Or should I go?

475
00:26:24,394 --> 00:26:25,354
I'll go check it out.

476
00:26:26,235 --> 00:26:27,235
By the way,

477
00:26:27,794 --> 00:26:29,435
I want

478
00:26:30,435 --> 00:26:31,275
to go to the restroom.

479
00:26:33,435 --> 00:26:34,755
Now, Rong?

480
00:26:35,114 --> 00:26:36,235
I have to go really badly.

481
00:26:36,235 --> 00:26:37,275
I'll be back soon.

482
00:26:38,035 --> 00:26:39,074
Alright.

483
00:26:39,675 --> 00:26:40,354
Uncle Zong,

484
00:26:40,435 --> 00:26:41,594
let Rong go.

485
00:26:46,995 --> 00:26:48,354
Let's continue eating.

486
00:27:14,675 --> 00:27:15,755
Next,

487
00:27:15,755 --> 00:27:17,874
let the Great Demon God
descend on this world!

488
00:27:26,074 --> 00:27:26,874
(I need to inform)

489
00:27:26,874 --> 00:27:27,834
(the other Elders as soon as possible)

490
00:27:28,195 --> 00:27:29,874
(the Xueying Territory is in danger.)

491
00:27:35,391 --> 00:27:37,400
(Si Mansion)

492
00:27:41,675 --> 00:27:43,195
Xueying, do you mean

493
00:27:43,515 --> 00:27:45,195
Chi Qiubai was attacked

494
00:27:45,275 --> 00:27:46,834
by demons in the Xueying Territory?

495
00:27:47,074 --> 00:27:48,114
I'm clear
about the defensive capabilities

496
00:27:48,114 --> 00:27:49,154
of the Xueying Territory.

497
00:27:49,515 --> 00:27:50,354
If even my master

498
00:27:50,354 --> 00:27:51,554
can't handle this matter,

499
00:27:51,554 --> 00:27:53,154
it means the situation is very urgent.

500
00:27:53,755 --> 00:27:54,435
So

501
00:27:54,554 --> 00:27:55,594
Elders, please go

502
00:27:55,755 --> 00:27:57,035
with me to the Xueying Territory

503
00:27:57,035 --> 00:27:58,435
to protect my people.

504
00:27:58,794 --> 00:27:59,634
This Hexagonal Sword

505
00:27:59,634 --> 00:28:01,354
belongs to Knight Changfeng.

506
00:28:01,715 --> 00:28:04,154
But whether this is a trap

507
00:28:04,594 --> 00:28:06,235
is unclear.

508
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:08,394
Moreover, Nanqin

509
00:28:08,394 --> 00:28:10,594
is already at war with the Demon Clan,

510
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:12,314
and it hasn't ended yet.

511
00:28:12,554 --> 00:28:13,955
What if the Demon Well is breached

512
00:28:14,114 --> 00:28:16,195
after we leave?

513
00:28:16,475 --> 00:28:18,634
Our primary responsibility
is to eliminate demons.

514
00:28:19,035 --> 00:28:19,755
As long as

515
00:28:19,755 --> 00:28:20,794
there are demons here,

516
00:28:20,794 --> 00:28:22,074
I won't go anywhere else.

517
00:28:22,435 --> 00:28:24,394
Qiubai never parts with his sword.

518
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:26,035
This sword wouldn't

519
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:27,035
leave its owner for no reason.

520
00:28:27,154 --> 00:28:28,915
If the Xueying Territory is in danger,

521
00:28:28,915 --> 00:28:30,955
Qiubai would also be in danger.

522
00:28:31,475 --> 00:28:33,074
What exactly happened?

523
00:28:33,275 --> 00:28:34,435
Did Qiubai

524
00:28:34,554 --> 00:28:35,995
lose control of this sword?

525
00:28:36,314 --> 00:28:37,035
We should hurry over

526
00:28:37,035 --> 00:28:38,314
and take a look.

527
00:28:38,435 --> 00:28:40,915
Isn't it hasty to make a decision

528
00:28:41,154 --> 00:28:42,675
based on a sword alone?

529
00:28:42,915 --> 00:28:44,235
Besides, everyone has seen

530
00:28:44,515 --> 00:28:45,715
that this place is already engaged

531
00:28:45,715 --> 00:28:46,955
in battle with the Demon Clan.

532
00:28:47,074 --> 00:28:47,515
But...

533
00:28:47,515 --> 00:28:48,195
Xueying,

534
00:28:49,314 --> 00:28:50,435
you may leave now.

535
00:28:58,275 --> 00:28:58,874
How did the discussion go?

536
00:28:58,874 --> 00:29:00,074
Shall we set off now?

537
00:29:00,074 --> 00:29:01,035
They're still discussing.

538
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,195
Time waits for no one.

539
00:29:02,195 --> 00:29:03,154
Let's discuss it later

540
00:29:03,154 --> 00:29:04,035
on the way.

541
00:29:04,035 --> 00:29:05,435
Right. We can't delay any longer.

542
00:29:05,755 --> 00:29:06,675
Every minute we waste

543
00:29:06,675 --> 00:29:07,475
puts our master and the people
of the Xueying Territory

544
00:29:07,475 --> 00:29:08,475
in more danger.

545
00:29:08,475 --> 00:29:09,834
If they don't go, we will.

546
00:29:09,955 --> 00:29:11,195
We don't need to rely on others.

547
00:29:11,195 --> 00:29:12,435
We can do it by ourselves.

548
00:29:13,035 --> 00:29:14,154
We'll go with you.

549
00:29:14,394 --> 00:29:14,955
Let's go.

550
00:29:15,515 --> 00:29:16,354
Wait a moment.

551
00:29:20,834 --> 00:29:21,554
Xueying,

552
00:29:21,715 --> 00:29:23,275
I understand your feelings.

553
00:29:23,314 --> 00:29:24,475
But how can you be sure

554
00:29:24,475 --> 00:29:26,154
this isn't a ploy to misdirect us?

555
00:29:27,715 --> 00:29:29,235
Qiubai is always cautious.

556
00:29:29,235 --> 00:29:30,755
His action this time is unusual.

557
00:29:30,995 --> 00:29:32,314
The situation is special now.

558
00:29:32,794 --> 00:29:33,834
The Demon Clan

559
00:29:33,834 --> 00:29:34,915
has attacked the Demon Well twice.

560
00:29:35,195 --> 00:29:37,154
If this is their trick,

561
00:29:37,394 --> 00:29:38,915
the consequences would be unimaginable.

562
00:29:39,154 --> 00:29:40,435
We must be on guard.

563
00:29:41,715 --> 00:29:42,515
Anyway,

564
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:44,275
I'm going to the Xueying Territory now.

565
00:29:45,035 --> 00:29:46,675
It was the Si Family's fault back then

566
00:29:46,675 --> 00:29:47,915
that caused the Demon Well to fall.

567
00:29:48,114 --> 00:29:49,834
Now Chi Qiubai hasn't shown up,

568
00:29:49,834 --> 00:29:51,195
and only his sword shows up,

569
00:29:52,195 --> 00:29:53,074
which

570
00:29:53,074 --> 00:29:54,995
inevitably raises doubts.

571
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:56,354
If this leads

572
00:29:56,354 --> 00:29:58,035
to the Demon Well being lost again,

573
00:29:58,475 --> 00:29:59,195
what will happen

574
00:29:59,435 --> 00:30:01,275
to the honor

575
00:30:01,475 --> 00:30:02,675
of the Water Daoist Temple?

576
00:30:11,634 --> 00:30:13,114
Great Demon God!

577
00:30:18,715 --> 00:30:19,995
It's getting late,

578
00:30:20,275 --> 00:30:21,235
and the soldiers need

579
00:30:21,235 --> 00:30:22,195
to get back to their duties.

580
00:30:22,755 --> 00:30:23,715
But

581
00:30:23,874 --> 00:30:25,874
everyone is enjoying
themselves right now.

582
00:30:26,594 --> 00:30:28,554
I haven't had enough fun yet, Qingshi.

583
00:30:28,554 --> 00:30:30,394
Rong, it's a bit late today.

584
00:30:30,394 --> 00:30:31,074
Let's do it next time.

585
00:30:31,195 --> 00:30:32,915
