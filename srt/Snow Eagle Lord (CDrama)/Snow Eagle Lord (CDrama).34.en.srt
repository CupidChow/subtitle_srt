21
00:01:57,243 --> 00:01:57,963
Jingqiu,

22
00:01:58,323 --> 00:01:59,564
why don't you sleep a bit more?

23
00:02:00,724 --> 00:02:01,484
Youyue,

24
00:02:01,564 --> 00:02:02,883
come and see the paintings I've done.

25
00:02:11,324 --> 00:02:12,644
So many.

26
00:02:15,924 --> 00:02:17,243
What are you...?

27
00:02:17,723 --> 00:02:19,204
I want to paint every moment

28
00:02:19,324 --> 00:02:20,164
between me and Xueying

29
00:02:20,283 --> 00:02:21,364
and make it into an album.

30
00:02:21,764 --> 00:02:23,044
If in the future,

31
00:02:23,243 --> 00:02:24,484
I'm not here anymore,

32
00:02:25,084 --> 00:02:26,764
Xueying can look at these paintings

33
00:02:26,884 --> 00:02:27,403
and remember

34
00:02:27,484 --> 00:02:28,963
the beautiful memories we made together.

35
00:02:30,324 --> 00:02:31,484
Stop painting.

36
00:02:31,604 --> 00:02:33,283
Get ready quickly.

37
00:02:33,364 --> 00:02:34,484
Someone is coming soon.

38
00:02:34,523 --> 00:02:35,444
Who's coming?

39
00:02:35,963 --> 00:02:37,723
You're about to get married.

40
00:02:37,803 --> 00:02:38,444
Should you let someone else

41
00:02:38,444 --> 00:02:39,644
try on your wedding clothes?

42
00:02:41,644 --> 00:02:42,444
Let's go.

43
00:02:43,764 --> 00:02:44,283
Let's go.

44
00:02:52,003 --> 00:02:52,723
Mrs. Xue.

45
00:02:53,484 --> 00:02:54,243
Xueying,

46
00:02:54,843 --> 00:02:56,003
I have something to tell you.

47
00:02:56,803 --> 00:02:57,563
Mrs. Xue,

48
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:58,764
why don't you

49
00:02:58,764 --> 00:02:59,484
talk about it later?

50
00:02:59,563 --> 00:03:00,324
It's almost time for the wedding.

51
00:03:00,324 --> 00:03:01,243
There's no room for delays.

52
00:03:01,324 --> 00:03:02,003
Puyang Bo,

53
00:03:02,324 --> 00:03:03,723
you go ahead and take the things in.

54
00:03:11,444 --> 00:03:12,123
Let's go.

55
00:03:17,324 --> 00:03:18,683
The betrothal gifts have arrived.

56
00:03:22,084 --> 00:03:23,563
Jingqiu, Youyue.

57
00:03:24,204 --> 00:03:25,444
This is the list of betrothal gifts,

58
00:03:25,523 --> 00:03:26,924
64 items in all.

59
00:03:27,044 --> 00:03:27,963
Jingqiu, you can check them.

60
00:03:28,283 --> 00:03:29,523
No need.

61
00:03:29,644 --> 00:03:30,683
That won't do.

62
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:31,563
If the gifts don't meet
our expectations,

63
00:03:31,563 --> 00:03:32,644
Jingqiu won't be getting married.

64
00:03:35,204 --> 00:03:37,044
50,000 kilograms of energy crystals,

65
00:03:38,044 --> 00:03:40,324
50 cultivation books,

66
00:03:40,683 --> 00:03:42,084
30 magical tools.

67
00:03:42,924 --> 00:03:44,444
There are too many.

68
00:03:44,563 --> 00:03:45,963
These are not

69
00:03:46,044 --> 00:03:46,604
ordinary things

70
00:03:46,683 --> 00:03:47,644
that you can buy on the market.

71
00:03:47,764 --> 00:03:48,764
I robbed...

72
00:03:49,884 --> 00:03:51,924
I looked for a long time
to gather them all.

73
00:03:52,683 --> 00:03:53,324
Dongbo Xueying

74
00:03:53,403 --> 00:03:54,884
is my sworn buddy.

75
00:03:54,963 --> 00:03:55,403
For him,

76
00:03:55,563 --> 00:03:56,044
I made

77
00:03:56,164 --> 00:03:57,164
great efforts.

78
00:03:58,324 --> 00:03:59,204
Puyang Bo,

79
00:03:59,324 --> 00:03:59,803
this looks

80
00:03:59,803 --> 00:04:01,204
like a bad idea from you.

81
00:04:01,364 --> 00:04:02,243
Is this a wedding

82
00:04:02,243 --> 00:04:03,283
or a war?

83
00:04:04,164 --> 00:04:05,604
I knew you would say that.

84
00:04:05,683 --> 00:04:06,243
Look at that.

85
00:04:08,764 --> 00:04:10,563
The legendary Quanshu?

86
00:04:10,924 --> 00:04:12,364
The legendary Quanshu

87
00:04:12,364 --> 00:04:13,963
is a kind of fire-resistant mythical creature,

88
00:04:14,084 --> 00:04:14,963
representing a love
that burns passionately,

89
00:04:14,963 --> 00:04:15,884
like a fierce fire.

90
00:04:15,963 --> 00:04:16,644
Besides,

91
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:17,684
it is also

92
00:04:17,684 --> 00:04:18,564
the most affectionate divine creature.

93
00:04:19,923 --> 00:04:21,283
Now you have nothing to say, right?

94
00:04:21,564 --> 00:04:22,764
I do.

95
00:04:22,843 --> 00:04:23,804
Now that the betrothal gifts are here,

96
00:04:23,923 --> 00:04:24,644
you should leave now.

97
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:26,363
No. Wait.

98
00:04:26,363 --> 00:04:27,324
Learn from Jingqiu.

99
00:04:27,324 --> 00:04:28,204
Look how gentle she is.

100
00:04:28,204 --> 00:04:29,363
You're always picking on me every day.

101
00:04:29,363 --> 00:04:30,363
You think I'm not gentle.

102
00:04:30,363 --> 00:04:31,004
No.

103
00:04:31,084 --> 00:04:31,723
Wait.

104
00:04:31,723 --> 00:04:32,523
You're asking for a beating.

105
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:33,444
There are others here.

106
00:04:33,564 --> 00:04:35,124
Leave now.

107
00:05:03,764 --> 00:05:05,923
Jingqiu, you haven't slept yet?

108
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,124
I will sleep
after finishing this painting.

109
00:05:08,204 --> 00:05:08,963
You want to talk to me?

110
00:05:11,204 --> 00:05:12,084
No, it's not me.

111
00:05:12,204 --> 00:05:13,283
It's my master who wants to talk to you.

112
00:05:13,723 --> 00:05:14,963
Ms. Ye Mei?

113
00:05:14,963 --> 00:05:16,124
What does she want with me?

114
00:05:18,363 --> 00:05:19,444
Master said

115
00:05:19,564 --> 00:05:20,884
you'd get married tomorrow

116
00:05:21,004 --> 00:05:22,923
and let me give you this book.

117
00:05:23,324 --> 00:05:24,603
Take a good look at it.

118
00:05:30,483 --> 00:05:31,603
Youyue.

119
00:05:32,043 --> 00:05:32,603
You...

120
00:05:32,603 --> 00:05:33,244
Jingqiu.

121
00:05:37,523 --> 00:05:39,004
Why do you look...?

122
00:05:39,843 --> 00:05:40,804
What is this?

123
00:05:45,963 --> 00:05:46,684
Jingqiu,

124
00:05:47,124 --> 00:05:48,043
I miss you.

125
00:05:49,764 --> 00:05:50,963
Did you drink?

126
00:05:52,043 --> 00:05:52,963
I had a little.

127
00:05:54,363 --> 00:05:55,923
Can I have a little more with you?

128
00:05:58,843 --> 00:06:00,483
Isn't it said that meeting
before the wedding

129
00:06:00,483 --> 00:06:01,684
is a bit unlucky?

130
00:06:01,804 --> 00:06:02,483
I don't care.

131
00:06:03,043 --> 00:06:04,644
I just want

132
00:06:05,124 --> 00:06:06,884
to talk to you and have
a good drink with you

133
00:06:07,363 --> 00:06:08,163
before the wedding.

134
00:06:10,884 --> 00:06:11,564
Alright.

135
00:06:12,163 --> 00:06:13,204
I happen to have a gift

136
00:06:13,204 --> 00:06:14,124
to give you.

137
00:06:14,204 --> 00:06:15,244
You wait outside for me.

138
00:06:52,403 --> 00:06:53,923
Are you satisfied

139
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,124
with the betrothal gifts from me today?

140
00:06:55,523 --> 00:06:56,644
I've already told you.

141
00:06:56,764 --> 00:06:57,923
Just keep it simple.

142
00:06:58,004 --> 00:06:59,764
Why do you bother
with those formalities?

143
00:07:00,804 --> 00:07:02,324
It's not just formalities.

144
00:07:02,444 --> 00:07:03,963
That's my determination.

145
00:07:04,644 --> 00:07:06,324
Not being able
to give you a grand wedding

146
00:07:06,403 --> 00:07:07,963
is my biggest regret.

147
00:07:09,403 --> 00:07:10,324
Xueying,

148
00:07:11,004 --> 00:07:11,923
thank you.

149
00:07:12,523 --> 00:07:13,644
But

150
00:07:13,843 --> 00:07:16,564
I want to let that Quanshu go.

151
00:07:17,163 --> 00:07:18,004
Why?

152
00:07:18,603 --> 00:07:19,923
I went through considerable difficulty

153
00:07:20,004 --> 00:07:21,324
in catching it.

154
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:22,483
I know.

155
00:07:22,684 --> 00:07:24,923
But it's said
that the divine creature Quanshu

156
00:07:25,244 --> 00:07:26,843
has only one partner in its life.

157
00:07:26,963 --> 00:07:28,324
You caught one.

158
00:07:28,444 --> 00:07:29,684
What about the other one?

159
00:07:29,684 --> 00:07:30,884
Isn't it pitiful?

160
00:07:33,923 --> 00:07:35,403
You feel sorry for it

161
00:07:35,884 --> 00:07:37,163
and not for me?

162
00:07:37,523 --> 00:07:38,764
Of course I feel sorry for you.

163
00:07:39,644 --> 00:07:40,523
I've also specially prepared

164
00:07:40,523 --> 00:07:41,523
a gift for you.

165
00:07:52,043 --> 00:07:53,564
You've painted this much?

166
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:01,843
But...

167
00:08:02,483 --> 00:08:03,603
But what?

168
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,564
The woman in the painting

169
00:08:05,923 --> 00:08:07,324
is not even one-tenth
as beautiful as you.

170
00:08:09,043 --> 00:08:10,363
If you don't like it,
give it back to me.

171
00:08:12,603 --> 00:08:13,444
Jingqiu,

172
00:08:14,884 --> 00:08:15,804
you

173
00:08:16,603 --> 00:08:17,644
are the best gift given

174
00:08:17,644 --> 00:08:18,684
by heaven.

175
00:08:19,884 --> 00:08:21,324
What's gotten into you today?

176
00:08:21,444 --> 00:08:22,244
Did you eat something sweet?

177
00:08:22,363 --> 00:08:23,684
Did I eat something sweet?

178
00:08:24,124 --> 00:08:25,483
Why don't you try and see for yourself?

179
00:08:29,564 --> 00:08:30,764
Drinking is boring.

180
00:08:31,004 --> 00:08:32,924
Let's play a game instead.

181
00:08:34,243 --> 00:08:35,084
Let's roll some dice,

182
00:08:35,684 --> 00:08:37,363
and whoever gets a bigger number wins.

183
00:08:37,483 --> 00:08:39,444
The loser must drink

184
00:08:39,564 --> 00:08:41,164
and answer a question.

185
00:08:41,243 --> 00:08:42,044
You're game or not?

186
00:08:42,164 --> 00:08:42,723
As you wish.

187
00:08:47,284 --> 00:08:48,044
Mine will be bigger.

188
00:08:48,684 --> 00:08:49,723
Then mine will be smaller.

189
00:09:02,924 --> 00:09:05,204
I lost. Ask away.

190
00:09:06,843 --> 00:09:08,564
What's your biggest wish?

191
00:09:10,003 --> 00:09:11,363
My wish

192
00:09:11,883 --> 00:09:13,284
is already half completed.

193
00:09:16,243 --> 00:09:17,603
Getting married to you

194
00:09:18,164 --> 00:09:19,164
and having a child.

195
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:28,164
Come on.

196
00:09:34,404 --> 00:09:36,204
How come you always win?

197
00:09:46,084 --> 00:09:46,883
Ask.

198
00:09:47,684 --> 00:09:48,883
Have you ever lied to me?

199
00:09:57,084 --> 00:09:57,723
Yes.

200
00:09:58,564 --> 00:09:59,404
But

201
00:10:00,044 --> 00:10:01,643
it's a white lie.

202
00:10:02,084 --> 00:10:03,084
Believe me.

203
00:10:08,164 --> 00:10:09,404
Of course I do.

204
00:10:10,404 --> 00:10:11,804
I believe anything you say.

205
00:10:14,164 --> 00:10:16,363
I don't believe I can't beat you.

206
00:10:23,044 --> 00:10:24,243
Finally, it's my turn.

207
00:10:26,524 --> 00:10:28,003
My question is simple.

208
00:10:29,204 --> 00:10:30,483
Have you ever lied to me,

209
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:32,843
or

210
00:10:32,963 --> 00:10:34,363
will you?

211
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:36,684
I want to hear the truth.

212
00:10:43,564 --> 00:10:45,003
Every word I've said to you

213
00:10:45,204 --> 00:10:46,164
is true.

214
00:10:46,483 --> 00:10:47,843
I will never lie to you.

215
00:10:50,084 --> 00:10:51,204
I knew it.

216
00:10:51,804 --> 00:10:53,084
You would never lie to me.

217
00:11:23,804 --> 00:11:24,524
Jingqiu,

218
00:11:26,723 --> 00:11:28,524
I don't want to let you go at all.

219
00:11:31,284 --> 00:11:32,284
I won't go.

220
00:11:34,084 --> 00:11:35,284
After tomorrow,

221
00:11:36,444 --> 00:11:38,324
we will never be apart again.

222
00:11:55,483 --> 00:11:56,404
(Jingqiu,)

223
00:11:58,723 --> 00:11:59,843
(don't hate me.)

224
00:12:02,483 --> 00:12:03,324
How is it?

225
00:12:03,404 --> 00:12:04,123
Jingqiu,

226
00:12:04,123 --> 00:12:05,284
it's only been a few days,

227
00:12:05,284 --> 00:12:07,003
and your waist is thinner again.

228
00:12:07,123 --> 00:12:08,804
I need to be slim to be

229
00:12:08,804 --> 00:12:09,643
a fairy-like bride.

230
00:12:09,723 --> 00:12:11,404
You're already a fairy.

231
00:12:11,524 --> 00:12:12,564
Miss Fairy,

232
00:12:12,684 --> 00:12:13,643
the wedding is about to start.

233
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:14,123
Let's do your hair quickly.

234
00:12:14,123 --> 00:12:14,804
Young Master.

235
00:12:17,084 --> 00:12:19,363
Mrs. Xue, you're finally here.

236
00:12:19,643 --> 00:12:20,963
I thought...

237
00:12:21,963 --> 00:12:23,123
Actually,

238
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:25,084
I was against this marriage.

239
00:12:25,684 --> 00:12:26,843
But you are

240
00:12:27,003 --> 00:12:28,763
the most beloved to me.

241
00:12:29,164 --> 00:12:31,003
Today is your big day.

242
00:12:31,204 --> 00:12:32,483
Of course I'd come.

243
00:12:32,804 --> 00:12:34,603
Let me do your hair.

244
00:12:35,044 --> 00:12:35,763
Alright.

245
00:12:40,084 --> 00:12:41,363
Then I'll go outside and see

246
00:12:41,483 --> 00:12:42,564
if there's anything I can do to help.

247
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:48,524
Young Master,

248
00:12:49,243 --> 00:12:50,243
you look

249
00:12:50,243 --> 00:12:51,324
much better today.

250
00:12:51,643 --> 00:12:53,003
I'm in a good mood,

251
00:12:53,204 --> 00:12:54,643
so I look much better.

252
00:12:55,643 --> 00:12:56,924
This period

253
00:12:57,044 --> 00:12:58,684
has been the happiest time of my life.

254
00:12:59,564 --> 00:13:00,524
But is it really worth it

255
00:13:00,524 --> 00:13:01,963
for a man

256
00:13:02,483 --> 00:13:03,684
in the mortal world?

257
00:13:03,804 --> 00:13:05,044
Everyone dies eventually.

258
00:13:06,123 --> 00:13:07,804
If I just leave like this,

259
00:13:08,084 --> 00:13:08,804
what's the difference

260
00:13:08,804 --> 00:13:10,123
between that and being dead?

261
00:13:11,603 --> 00:13:13,084
I've decided to stay here.

262
00:13:13,684 --> 00:13:15,044
Whether it's a year,

263
00:13:15,363 --> 00:13:17,123
a month or a day,

264
00:13:17,763 --> 00:13:18,723
as long as I can spend more time

265
00:13:18,723 --> 00:13:20,123
with Xueying,

266
00:13:21,123 --> 00:13:22,603
I'll be happier.

267
00:13:24,044 --> 00:13:24,883
I hope Xueying

268
00:13:24,883 --> 00:13:26,324
never knows about this.

269
00:13:27,164 --> 00:13:28,003
That way,

270
00:13:28,404 --> 00:13:29,804
every moment he spends with me

271
00:13:29,804 --> 00:13:30,883
is filled with happiness.

272
00:13:32,204 --> 00:13:32,963
Alright.

273
00:13:34,084 --> 00:13:35,763
Since it's your decision,

274
00:13:36,723 --> 00:13:38,164
I can only congratulate you.

275
00:13:41,564 --> 00:13:42,404
Young Master,

276
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:45,324
I will always be with you.

277
00:13:51,603 --> 00:13:52,684
Mrs. Xue,

278
00:13:54,204 --> 00:13:55,044
thank you.

279
00:13:55,404 --> 00:13:56,924
I've lost my parents.

280
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:58,843
You are the closest person to me

281
00:13:58,843 --> 00:13:59,763
in the Moxue Empire.

282
00:14:00,084 --> 00:14:01,843
I'm really happy

283
00:14:01,963 --> 00:14:03,164
to have your blessing.

284
00:14:06,564 --> 00:14:07,804
The groom's party has arrived.

285
00:14:11,204 --> 00:14:11,963
Go.

286
00:14:19,164 --> 00:14:21,164
You can't do it, Young Master.

287
00:14:21,363 --> 00:14:22,164
Mrs. Xue,

288
00:14:22,164 --> 00:14:23,843
just accept Jingqiu's bow.

289
00:14:23,963 --> 00:14:25,603
Otherwise, she won't be at ease.

290
00:14:42,763 --> 00:14:45,284
I kneel before you
to express my gratitude.

291
00:14:51,243 --> 00:14:52,204
I'm leaving.

00:14:52,763 --> 00:14:53,524
Go.

382
00:18:57,004 --> 00:18:58,123
- Good!
- Good!

383
00:18:58,123 --> 00:18:59,284
- Good!
- Good!

384
00:18:59,524 --> 00:19:00,004
Let's go.

385
00:19:00,443 --> 00:19:03,324
- Good!
- Good!

386
00:19:24,643 --> 00:19:25,923
I just want to tell you.

387
00:19:26,084 --> 00:19:27,203
After entering the door later,

388
00:19:27,203 --> 00:19:28,084
don't cry,

389
00:19:28,163 --> 00:19:29,084
or you may expose the truth.

390
00:19:29,324 --> 00:19:30,724
Can't I be happy

391
00:19:30,724 --> 00:19:31,443
for Jingqiu?

392
00:19:32,084 --> 00:19:33,004
Alright.

393
00:19:33,163 --> 00:19:34,044
I just wanted to tell you not to slip up

394
00:19:34,044 --> 00:19:35,123
after we enter the house.

395
00:19:36,123 --> 00:19:36,764
I know.

396
00:19:38,084 --> 00:19:39,564
Alright, let's go.

397
00:19:54,603 --> 00:19:55,643

398
00:19:55,643 --> 00:19:56,603
Let's go in.

399
00:20:02,683 --> 00:20:05,784

400
00:20:41,764 --> 00:20:43,443
Bow to heaven and earth.

401
00:20:44,524 --> 00:20:45,324
- Good!
- Good!

402
00:20:45,403 --> 00:20:48,284
May the snow-capped mountains
bear witness to your everlasting love.

403
00:20:51,443 --> 00:20:53,324
- Good!
- Good!

404
00:20:54,683 --> 00:20:56,443
Bow to the parents.

405
00:20:58,524 --> 00:21:01,764
May your wedded life
be replete with bliss.

406
00:21:02,606 --> 00:21:03,967
(Spirit tablets
of Monarch Moxue and his wife)

407
00:21:03,967 --> 00:21:05,488

408
00:21:07,764 --> 00:21:09,284
Bow to each other.

409
00:21:11,443 --> 00:21:14,804
May your bond last

410
00:21:22,123 --> 00:21:23,964
- Good!

411
00:21:30,564 --> 00:21:33,123
Drink the wedding wine together

412
00:21:33,564 --> 00:21:36,603
and be forever intertwined.

413
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:40,084
- Good!

414
00:21:40,084 --> 00:21:41,004
In our custom,

415
00:21:41,044 --> 00:21:42,363

and the woman drinks the right one.

416
00:21:58,804 --> 00:21:59,524
Jingqiu.

417
00:21:59,683 --> 00:22:00,324
Youyue.

418
00:22:06,403 --> 00:22:07,443
It's nothing.

419
00:22:07,883 --> 00:22:09,564
I'm just too happy.

420
00:22:10,284 --> 00:22:12,203
From Changfeng Academy to now,

421
00:22:12,484 --> 00:22:13,484
we

422
00:22:13,603 --> 00:22:14,484
have experienced

423
00:22:14,484 --> 00:22:15,883
so many things together.

424
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,084
I really can't bear to part with you.

425
00:22:18,964 --> 00:22:20,484
After you get married,

426
00:22:21,484 --> 00:22:23,244
don't forget about us.

427
00:22:23,524 --> 00:22:24,804
How could I forget?

428
00:22:25,004 --> 00:22:26,443
I'm just getting married.

429
00:22:26,764 --> 00:22:28,084
I'm not losing my memory,

430
00:22:28,203 --> 00:22:29,724
and I'm not saying goodbye to you.

431
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:31,363
Yeah.

432
00:22:32,084 --> 00:22:33,203
It's your big day.

433
00:22:33,203 --> 00:22:34,363
Drink the wedding wine.

434
00:22:39,363 --> 00:22:40,324
Xueying,

435
00:22:40,923 --> 00:22:42,403
I've finally waited for this day.

436
00:22:48,603 --> 00:22:49,443
Hold on.

437
00:22:53,443 --> 00:22:54,564
The wine is poisoned.

438
00:22:56,123 --> 00:22:58,004
This is the serum
of the Soul Separation Kun Fish.

439
00:22:58,284 --> 00:22:59,923
If it stays in the wine glass
for more than seven minutes,

440
00:23:00,004 --> 00:23:00,764
scale-colored spots

441
00:23:00,764 --> 00:23:02,123
will appear,

442
00:23:02,123 --> 00:23:03,203
and it resembles blood when dropped.

443
00:23:03,284 --> 00:23:04,804
It's a good thing I found it in time.

444
00:23:05,443 --> 00:23:06,203
Xueying,

445
00:23:06,403 --> 00:23:07,804
we must make a thorough investigation

446
00:23:08,163 --> 00:23:10,163
into who poisoned the wine.

447
00:23:10,683 --> 00:23:12,123
What are their intentions?

448
00:23:35,883 --> 00:23:37,443
This cup of wine is for Jingqiu.

449
00:23:37,564 --> 00:23:38,603
Don't mix them up.

450
00:23:38,764 --> 00:23:40,764
They say women are the cruelest.

451
00:23:41,284 --> 00:23:43,044
But I think men can be
even more terrifying

452
00:23:43,084 --> 00:23:44,443
when they're heartless.

453
00:23:45,163 --> 00:23:46,524
In doing so,

454
00:23:46,564 --> 00:23:48,163
Xueying is not only cruel to Yu Jingqiu

455
00:23:48,603 --> 00:23:50,123
but even crueler to himself.

456
00:23:50,363 --> 00:23:51,964
Doesn't his heart ache?

457
00:23:53,004 --> 00:23:54,324
He is

458
00:23:54,324 --> 00:23:55,004
such an emotional man.

459
00:23:55,603 --> 00:23:57,004
How could he be at ease?

460
00:23:58,244 --> 00:23:59,764
- But for Jingqiu...
- Enough.

461
00:24:00,443 --> 00:24:01,843
This is Xueying's decision.

462
00:24:02,203 --> 00:24:03,883
Since we've already promised him,

463
00:24:04,484 --> 00:24:05,564
we'll definitely make Jingqiu

464
00:24:05,564 --> 00:24:06,883
drink this cup of wine.

465
00:24:08,643 --> 00:24:09,484
I just hope that in the future,

466
00:24:09,484 --> 00:24:10,964
he won't regret it.

467
00:24:14,044 --> 00:24:14,964
What's wrong?

468
00:24:17,163 --> 00:24:18,683
Why are you all looking at me?

469
00:24:33,244 --> 00:24:35,363
This is indeed the serum
of the Soul Separation Kun Fish.

470
00:24:36,044 --> 00:24:37,484
But it won't harm you.

471
00:24:38,004 --> 00:24:38,883
It will only

472
00:24:39,163 --> 00:24:40,764

Why?

476

even divine power

557
00:28:46,923 --> 00:28:48,443
is second to it.

558
00:28:49,004 --> 00:28:50,923

my young master's divine bloodline

559
00:28:51,044 --> 00:28:52,603

00:29:08,724 --> 00:29:10,363
And your Ancient Bloodline

567
00:29:13,324 --> 00:29:15,324
has accelerated it.

568
00:29:15,964 --> 00:29:17,004
But she would rather die

569
00:29:17,004 --> 00:29:18,524
to be with you.

570
00:29:19,843 --> 00:29:22,484
She's nearing her end,

571
00:29:24,883 --> 00:29:27,403
but she still wants to marry you.

572
00:29:30,004 --> 00:29:30,883
So

573
00:29:33,363 --> 00:29:35,163
her weakness

574
00:29:36,564 --> 00:29:37,883
is caused by me?

575
00:29:38,203 --> 00:29:39,724
That's also why

576
00:29:40,403 --> 00:29:41,843
I've always been

577
00:29:41,843 --> 00:29:43,883
against you being with her.

578
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:47,284
I...

579
00:29:47,363 --> 00:29:48,683
How can I save her?

580
00:29:51,084 --> 00:29:53,284
The only way to save her now

581
00:29:55,203 --> 00:29:57,084
is to take her back to the Moxue Empire.

582
00:29:58,203 --> 00:30:00,044
But she doesn't want to leave.

583
00:30:01,403 --> 00:30:03,443
Because she can't let go of you.

584
00:30:04,443 --> 00:30:05,883
She forbade me

585
00:30:05,883 --> 00:30:07,843
to tell you all this.

586
00:30:08,403 --> 00:30:10,084
But Lord Xueying,

587
00:30:10,883 --> 00:30:12,123
I can't just watch

588
00:30:12,123 --> 00:30:14,084
as she walks towards her death.

589
00:30:15,284 --> 00:30:16,403
I beg you.

590
00:30:18,524 --> 00:30:20,123
Please save her.

591
00:30:21,524 --> 00:30:23,603
Please give her a way to live.

592
00:30:27,724 --> 00:30:29,084
What do you want me to do?

593
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:33,524
You have the Ancient Bloodline.

594
00:30:35,084 --> 00:30:36,923
I'm the Spirit Hairpin
of the Moxue Empire.

595
00:30:37,524 --> 00:30:39,244
With only a special primer,

596
00:30:39,403 --> 00:30:40,044
we can

597
00:30:40,044 --> 00:30:41,564
reopen the Demon Well

598
00:30:42,324 --> 00:30:43,843
and send my young master back.

599
00:30:45,244 --> 00:30:46,244
What primer?

600
00:30:51,843 --> 00:30:53,284
Your heart blood.

601
00:30:55,403 --> 00:30:56,403
I know

602
00:30:56,564 --> 00:30:58,683
this choice is hard for you.

603
00:30:59,484 --> 00:31:01,163
You have to give up your love

604
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,724
and sever your ties
with my young master.

605
00:31:04,564 --> 00:31:05,403
Besides,

606
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:07,363
if we reopen the Demon Well

607
00:31:07,363 --> 00:31:08,284
carelessly,

608
00:31:08,284 --> 00:31:09,603
it could lead to a big mistake.

609
00:31:10,324 --> 00:31:12,484
But my young master's life is at stake.

610
00:31:16,203 --> 00:31:18,163
We have no other choice.

611
00:31:24,484 --> 00:31:26,284
Jingqiu, what's wrong?

612
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:27,883
You've been coughing lately.

613
00:31:28,004 --> 00:31:28,883
It's nothing.

614
00:31:29,363 --> 00:31:31,084
Just a little Qi deficiency.

615
00:31:31,643 --> 00:31:33,123
Are you still feeling unwell?

616
00:31:33,363 --> 00:31:34,443
It still hasn't gotten better?

617
00:31:34,603 --> 00:31:35,964
It's already fine.

618
00:31:36,123 --> 00:31:37,484
Since I was little in the Moxue Empire,

619
00:31:37,484 --> 00:31:39,163
Mrs. Xue has always doted on me.

620
00:31:39,443 --> 00:31:41,324
She likes to make a big fuss
over small things.

621
00:31:43,484 --> 00:31:44,284
- Xueying.
- Jingqiu.

622
00:31:44,484 --> 00:31:45,244
How are you?

623
00:31:45,564 --> 00:31:46,883
I'm not feeling well.

624
00:31:47,284 --> 00:31:48,883
I need to rest for a while.

625
00:31:49,084 --> 00:31:49,683
Alright.

626
00:31:50,484 --> 00:31:52,163
From now on, no matter where you are,

627
00:31:52,403 --> 00:31:53,044
you are

628
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,324
the love of Dongbo Xueying

629
00:31:54,724 --> 00:31:56,363
and the Lady of the Xueying Territory.

630
00:31:58,163 --> 00:31:59,203
I do.

631
00:32:27,363 --> 00:32:28,564
Hurry up, Xueying.

632
00:32:31,484 --> 00:32:32,084
Oh, no.

633
00:32:32,324 --> 00:32:33,683
Mrs. Xue, hold her.

634
00:32:42,163 --> 00:32:43,004
Young Master.

635
00:32:43,403 --> 00:32:44,524
Don't, Xueying.

636
00:32:44,764 --> 00:32:46,403
Your Dou Qi will hurt her.

637
00:32:49,284 --> 00:32:50,764
I see.

638
00:32:52,123 --> 00:32:53,484
Dongbo Xueying,

639
00:32:53,603 --> 00:32:54,804
I didn't expect

640
00:32:54,923 --> 00:32:56,244
that you would open the Demon Well

641
00:32:56,244 --> 00:32:57,443
for a woman.

642
00:32:58,363 --> 00:32:59,163
Why don't we

643
00:32:59,163 --> 00:33:00,403
make a deal?

644
00:33:00,883 --> 00:33:02,724
I let your people in,

645
00:33:02,964 --> 00:33:05,004
and you let my demonic power out.

646
00:33:05,324 --> 00:33:06,603
How about that?

647
00:33:08,603 --> 00:33:09,443
Or I'll turn

648
00:33:09,443 --> 00:33:11,044
your wedding into a funeral

649
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:13,123
and send her to death.

650
00:33:28,923 --> 00:33:30,084
I'll deal with Ao Lan.

651
00:33:33,643 --> 00:33:34,443
Mrs. Xue.

652
00:33:41,004 --> 00:33:43,203
Xueying, hurry, there's no time.

653
00:33:53,324 --> 00:33:54,363
Live well

654
00:33:55,403 --> 00:33:56,324
and forget about me.

It must be painful

695
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:33,444
for Xueying to do it.

696
00:37:33,603 --> 00:37:35,243
I didn't agree
with it in the first place.

697
00:37:35,564 --> 00:37:36,964
If you didn't agree back then,

698
00:37:37,123 --> 00:37:38,603
why didn't you stop it then?

699
00:37:39,044 --> 00:37:40,763
You didn't refuse

700
00:37:40,763 --> 00:37:41,803
when we carried out the plan.

701
00:37:42,123 --> 00:37:42,844
I...

702
00:37:43,924 --> 00:37:45,323
Jingqiu must go back.

703
00:37:46,283 --> 00:37:48,123
So are you still going

704
00:37:48,123 --> 00:37:49,004
to hold the wedding?

705
00:37:50,763 --> 00:37:51,484
Of course.

706
00:37:52,044 --> 00:37:53,044
Not only will we hold it,

707
00:37:53,364 --> 00:37:54,283
but we'll also make it grand.

708
00:37:54,884 --> 00:37:56,524
I want the whole world to know

709
00:37:56,803 --> 00:37:57,763
Yu Jingqiu

710
00:37:57,884 --> 00:37:59,643
is the only wife

711
00:38:00,084 --> 00:38:01,283
of Dongbo Xueying.

712
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:03,723
Alright.

713
00:38:04,203 --> 00:38:04,844
Xueying,

714
00:38:05,203 --> 00:38:06,484
you are my best buddy.

715
00:38:06,643 --> 00:38:07,364
I'll support

716
00:38:07,364 --> 00:38:08,283
whatever decision you make.

717
00:38:08,723 --> 00:38:09,404
Thanks.

718
00:38:09,803 --> 00:38:11,243
As long as you won't regret it.

719
00:38:12,884 --> 00:38:14,603
So how do we do it?

720
00:38:14,763 --> 00:38:16,044
Do you have a plan?

721
00:38:17,044 --> 00:38:18,243
Mrs. Xue said

722
00:38:18,564 --> 00:38:20,444
she could use my Ancient Bloodline

723
00:38:20,643 --> 00:38:22,283
to go back through the Demon Well.

724
00:38:22,444 --> 00:38:23,884
Through the Demon Well?

725
00:38:23,884 --> 00:38:25,364
That means we need
to reopen the Demon Well?

726
00:38:27,123 --> 00:38:28,283
Listen to my arrangement.

727
00:38:30,564 --> 00:38:31,283
That's how it is.

728
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:36,643
What else could we do?

729
00:38:37,763 --> 00:38:38,884
We couldn't just watch

730
00:38:38,884 --> 00:38:40,243
Jingqiu die.

731
00:38:41,803 --> 00:38:43,844
It turns out that the pain brought
by love in the world

732
00:38:44,924 --> 00:38:46,763
far exceeds that of cultivation.

733
00:38:47,844 --> 00:38:49,803
Jingqiu is a descendant of gods.

734
00:38:49,964 --> 00:38:51,283
Marrying a fairy

735
00:38:51,283 --> 00:38:52,203
as a wife

736
00:38:52,203 --> 00:38:53,763
is destined to be difficult.

737
00:38:54,283 --> 00:38:55,884
What nonsense are you talking about?

738
00:38:55,964 --> 00:38:57,084
You're different.

739
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,084
You're different.

740
00:38:59,163 --> 00:39:00,123
So

741
00:39:00,243 --> 00:39:01,404
what should we do now?

742
00:39:01,683 --> 00:39:03,283
Xueying has shut himself in his room

743
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:04,564
for as long as Jingqiu

744
00:39:04,564 --> 00:39:05,964
has been away.

745
00:39:05,964 --> 00:39:07,123
If this goes on,

746
00:39:07,964 --> 00:39:09,323
he'll become a waste.

747
00:39:10,603 --> 00:39:11,643
The book says

748
00:39:12,123 --> 00:39:12,803
if you want

749
00:39:12,803 --> 00:39:14,163
to completely forget someone,

750
00:39:15,044 --> 00:39:16,763
you have to start

751
00:39:17,243 --> 00:39:18,444
a new relationship.

752
00:39:21,884 --> 00:39:23,683
Why are you all looking at me?

753
00:39:23,844 --> 00:39:25,964
I'm not going to throw away
all other opportunities

754
00:39:26,044 --> 00:39:27,683
for just one guy.

755
00:39:27,924 --> 00:39:29,004
As for you...

756
00:39:29,283 --> 00:39:31,004
No, no.

757
00:39:31,044 --> 00:39:32,004
Wait, wait.

758
00:39:32,243 --> 00:39:32,924
Well…

759
00:39:33,723 --> 00:39:34,723
Can you all stop

760
00:39:34,723 --> 00:39:36,044
worrying about nothing?

761
00:39:37,123 --> 00:39:38,404
My brother's love
for my sister-in-law Jingqiu

762
00:39:38,404 --> 00:39:39,524
is unswerving.

763
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:40,723
Everybody knows that.

764
00:39:43,123 --> 00:39:43,803
Brother.

765
00:39:46,323 --> 00:39:47,323
Xueying.

766
00:39:47,603 --> 00:39:49,203
Jingqiu must have started a new life

767
00:39:49,323 --> 00:39:50,884
in the Moxue Empire now.

768
00:39:51,283 --> 00:39:52,603
My only wife in this life

769
00:39:52,763 --> 00:39:54,044
is Jingqiu.

770
00:39:54,364 --> 00:39:55,484
No matter where I am,

771
00:39:55,884 --> 00:39:57,844
in the Dragon Mountain Empire
or the Heavenly Palace,

772
00:39:58,044 --> 00:39:59,323
she is the only one in my heart.

773
00:39:59,364 --> 00:40:00,163
Xueying,

774
00:40:00,603 --> 00:40:02,123
you've finally figured it out.

775
00:40:03,723 --> 00:40:05,084
The top priority now

776
00:40:05,283 --> 00:40:07,004
is to find out who the traitor is.

777
00:40:21,163 --> 00:40:22,283
Dongbo Xueying,

778
00:40:22,683 --> 00:40:24,044
you're acting suspiciously.

779
00:40:24,723 --> 00:40:25,803
What are you going to do?

780
00:40:40,163 --> 00:40:41,004
What is this?

781
00:40:41,723 --> 00:40:43,364
This is a spirit stone
from the Demon Clan.

782
00:40:43,803 --> 00:40:44,924
The sap inside

783
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:45,884
can make cultivators

784
00:40:45,884 --> 00:40:47,163
lose their minds instantly

785
00:40:47,364 --> 00:40:48,723
and obey the Demon Clan.

786
00:40:49,323 --> 00:40:50,924
How dare you make Jingqiu

787
00:40:51,084 --> 00:40:52,603
take it during the battle?

788
00:40:52,763 --> 00:40:53,643
What was your intention?

789
00:40:55,283 --> 00:40:57,323
If you haven't joined the Demon Clan,

790
00:40:58,084 --> 00:40:59,603
let me see

791
00:40:59,643 --> 00:41:01,084
whether you are a human or a demon.

792
00:41:12,763 --> 00:41:13,884
I'm wronged.

793
00:41:17,004 --> 00:41:17,763
Xueying,

794
00:41:18,004 --> 00:41:19,844
let Situ Hong finish his talk.

795
00:41:24,283 --> 00:41:25,283
That day in the great battle,

796
00:41:25,643 --> 00:41:27,004
Jingqiu was seriously injured,

797
00:41:27,004 --> 00:41:27,924
her life hanging by a thread.

798
00:41:28,163 --> 00:41:29,763
I kindly took out a spirit stone

799
00:41:29,844 --> 00:41:30,803
to heal her.

800
00:41:31,283 --> 00:41:32,603
Other disciples in the sect

801
00:41:32,763 --> 00:41:33,723
also took

802
00:41:33,723 --> 00:41:34,924
the spirit stone sap I provided

803
00:41:35,323 --> 00:41:36,564
to recover.

804
00:41:36,643 --> 00:41:37,323
Everyone

805
00:41:37,683 --> 00:41:38,964
can go check it.

806
00:41:39,404 --> 00:41:40,404
But why do you insist

807
00:41:40,404 --> 00:41:41,884
that the one I gave Jingqiu

808
00:41:42,404 --> 00:41:43,484
had a problem?

809
00:41:44,044 --> 00:41:45,044
Moreover,

810
00:41:45,323 --> 00:41:47,404
I've never seen a spirit stone
from the Demon Clan.

811
00:41:47,643 --> 00:41:48,603
Dongbo Xueying,

812
00:41:48,763 --> 00:41:50,683
how can you

813
00:41:51,444 --> 00:41:53,243
accuse me without any evidence?

814
00:41:54,163 --> 00:41:55,884
Is it your place
to call her by Jingqiu?

815
00:41:57,564 --> 00:41:58,603
Elders,

816
00:41:58,844 --> 00:41:59,964
I admit

817
00:42:00,163 --> 00:42:01,683
I indeed adore Jingqiu.

818
00:42:02,004 --> 00:42:03,404
But I can say with a clear conscience

819
00:42:03,643 --> 00:42:05,044
my behavior towards her

820
00:42:05,283 --> 00:42:07,723
has not exceeded
the bounds of propriety.

821
00:42:07,924 --> 00:42:08,884
I could never do anything

822
00:42:08,884 --> 00:42:10,444
to harm Jingqiu's life.

823
00:42:11,163 --> 00:42:12,444
Today they said

824
00:42:12,564 --> 00:42:14,123
the demonic stone
was given to Jingqiu by me.

825
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:15,203
Tomorrow they'd say

826
00:42:15,203 --> 00:42:16,404
I am a member of the Demon Clan.

827
00:42:17,404 --> 00:42:18,603
Elders, please

828
00:42:19,524 --> 00:42:20,683
do me justice.

829
00:42:25,683 --> 00:42:27,364
You put up a good show.

830
00:42:27,524 --> 00:42:28,763
Only a demon

831
00:42:28,763 --> 00:42:30,643
would have a demonic stone.

832
00:42:31,203 --> 00:42:32,364
Or

833
00:42:32,564 --> 00:42:34,163
did you pick it up on the roadside?

834
00:42:36,243 --> 00:42:37,603
(You wretched girl,)

835
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,243
(see how I'll get back at you.)

836
00:42:41,404 --> 00:42:42,763
The spirit stones I used

837
00:42:43,084 --> 00:42:44,803
were all purchased

838
00:42:44,803 --> 00:42:45,564
from Kong's Weapon Workshop.

839
00:42:45,723 --> 00:42:46,884
Elders, please

840
00:42:47,044 --> 00:42:48,283
clear my name.

841
00:42:48,364 --> 00:42:49,243
Situ Hong,

842
00:42:49,283 --> 00:42:50,564
you're slandering us.

843
00:42:50,763 --> 00:42:52,123
How could our weapon workshop

844
00:42:52,243 --> 00:42:54,044
possibly sell something
from the Demon Clan?

845
00:42:54,243 --> 00:42:55,444
Don't even think about pinning it

846
00:42:55,444 --> 00:42:56,564
on our family.

847
00:42:56,603 --> 00:42:57,283
I'll beat you to death.

848
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:57,884
Enough.

849
00:42:58,924 --> 00:43:00,283
Stop the shouting

850
00:43:00,283 --> 00:43:01,123
and bickering!

851
00:43:03,723 --> 00:43:06,163
We can't assume

852
00:43:06,323 --> 00:43:07,844
Situ Hong is colluding
with the Demon Clan

853
00:43:07,924 --> 00:43:09,404
based on a mere stone.

854
00:43:10,163 --> 00:43:12,643
