21
00:01:55,578 --> 00:01:56,298
Didn't you say

22
00:01:56,298 --> 00:01:57,378
my sister would come to herself today?

23
00:01:57,738 --> 00:01:58,938
Why hasn't she woken up yet?

24
00:02:00,018 --> 00:02:00,977
Well,

25
00:02:01,218 --> 00:02:02,818
your sister's spiritual power is weak.

26
00:02:02,977 --> 00:02:04,098
And she was frightened,

27
00:02:04,658 --> 00:02:06,057
so her spiritual power scattered,

28
00:02:06,057 --> 00:02:07,018
which is why she fainted.

29
00:02:07,458 --> 00:02:09,937
I've already given her
an Energy Gathering Pill

30
00:02:09,937 --> 00:02:11,138
and infused Internal Energy into her.

31
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:12,497
Afterward,

32
00:02:12,657 --> 00:02:14,937
she'll wake up or not depending on

33
00:02:14,937 --> 00:02:15,897
her own will.

34
00:02:16,018 --> 00:02:17,777
So we're just waiting now?

35
00:02:18,578 --> 00:02:19,817
Is there any way

36
00:02:19,817 --> 00:02:20,978
to help her gather her spiritual power?

37
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:22,657
She can only make it by relying on

38
00:02:22,657 --> 00:02:23,578
her own strength.

39
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:24,698
External forces

40
00:02:24,698 --> 00:02:26,097
can only play a supporting role,

41
00:02:26,377 --> 00:02:27,897
which cannot help her
achieve advancement at all.

42
00:02:30,018 --> 00:02:30,458
Thirsty.

43
00:02:38,657 --> 00:02:39,497
Here, water.

44
00:02:53,138 --> 00:02:54,057
Great.

45
00:02:54,178 --> 00:02:55,538
Sis, you're finally awake.

46
00:02:58,937 --> 00:03:00,057
Since she is awake,

47
00:03:00,337 --> 00:03:02,178
stay here with your sister.

48
00:03:02,497 --> 00:03:03,698
I'm going to find Qiubai

49
00:03:03,777 --> 00:03:05,497
and ask about how the Bloodshed Weapons

50
00:03:05,698 --> 00:03:07,057
and Xueying are going on.

51
00:03:08,018 --> 00:03:08,817
Thank you, Master Sikong.

52
00:03:08,817 --> 00:03:09,298
Xueying.

53
00:03:11,458 --> 00:03:11,937
Sis.

54
00:03:12,418 --> 00:03:13,897
Oh my, lie down, please.

55
00:03:13,897 --> 00:03:15,018
Where is Xueying?

56
00:03:16,258 --> 00:03:17,458
Where is he?

57
00:03:17,897 --> 00:03:19,978
Xueying...

58
00:03:20,777 --> 00:03:22,217
What happened to Xueying?

59
00:03:23,138 --> 00:03:24,377
What's wrong with him?

60
00:03:25,418 --> 00:03:27,258
He fell into the Black Wind Cliff.

61
00:03:28,018 --> 00:03:29,978
Even several elders couldn't save him.

62
00:03:30,377 --> 00:03:31,377
I'm afraid...

63
00:03:32,617 --> 00:03:33,458
No.

64
00:03:34,978 --> 00:03:36,057
It's impossible.

65
00:03:36,497 --> 00:03:38,418
Sis, Sis, calm down.

66
00:03:38,458 --> 00:03:39,897
Your body hasn't recovered yet.

67
00:03:40,178 --> 00:03:41,617
I need to find Xueying.

68
00:03:42,617 --> 00:03:43,217
I need to save him.

69
00:03:43,217 --> 00:03:43,738
Wait.

70
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:44,817
Many elders

71
00:03:44,817 --> 00:03:45,738
couldn't save him.

72
00:03:45,738 --> 00:03:46,978
What can you do?

73
00:03:47,777 --> 00:03:49,377
We need to think of a way now.

74
00:03:49,817 --> 00:03:50,458
Otherwise,

75
00:03:50,777 --> 00:03:52,458
something will happen to Xueying.

76
00:03:52,858 --> 00:03:53,937
I have to find him.

77
00:03:55,458 --> 00:03:56,217
Sis, Sis.

78
00:03:56,817 --> 00:03:58,258
Y-You lie down first.

79
00:03:58,337 --> 00:03:59,097
Lie down first.

80
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,777
You haven't recovered yet.

81
00:04:00,978 --> 00:04:02,097
Come, lie down.

82
00:04:02,337 --> 00:04:03,178
Hurry up and lie down.

83
00:04:08,178 --> 00:04:09,258
Xueying.

84
00:04:11,978 --> 00:04:13,337
Master, what did you say?

85
00:04:14,418 --> 00:04:16,018
My brother fell into
the Black Wind Cliff?

86
00:04:20,137 --> 00:04:20,778
Qingshi.

87
00:04:20,858 --> 00:04:21,738
Is it true?

88
00:04:22,137 --> 00:04:23,577
Don't worry, listen to me.

89
00:04:24,858 --> 00:04:26,218
The Demon Clan
attacked the Sea God Palace.

90
00:04:26,298 --> 00:04:27,298
They wanted to perish

91
00:04:27,617 --> 00:04:28,658
together with us.

92
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,577
Xueying, in order to protect everyone,

93
00:04:31,218 --> 00:04:33,178
fell into the Black Wind Cliff

94
00:04:35,778 --> 00:04:37,418
with the Demon Clan commander
Xiang Pangyun.

95
00:04:41,738 --> 00:04:42,577
Qingshi,

96
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:44,057
don't worry now.

97
00:04:44,057 --> 00:04:45,298
How can I not worry?

98
00:04:45,738 --> 00:04:47,418
I'm going down to
the Black Wind Cliff to find my brother.

99
00:04:48,658 --> 00:04:50,298
I'm going to kill these demons.

100
00:04:50,817 --> 00:04:51,457
Qingshi.

101
00:04:52,978 --> 00:04:53,617
Master,

102
00:04:53,898 --> 00:04:54,937
let me go and check on him.

103
00:04:55,178 --> 00:04:55,978
Don't worry,

104
00:04:56,577 --> 00:04:58,218
I will definitely protect Qingshi.

105
00:04:59,978 --> 00:05:00,577
Alright.

106
00:05:12,778 --> 00:05:13,617
Qingshi.

107
00:05:18,017 --> 00:05:19,377
Qingshi, calm down.

108
00:05:19,377 --> 00:05:20,137
Don't stop me.

109
00:05:23,017 --> 00:05:23,697
Rong.

110
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:25,538
Are you alright?

111
00:05:25,778 --> 00:05:26,418
I'm sorry.

112
00:05:26,658 --> 00:05:27,697
I didn't mean it.

113
00:05:29,577 --> 00:05:30,577
I'm fine.

114
00:05:31,298 --> 00:05:32,778
I'm just worried about you.

115
00:05:37,937 --> 00:05:38,898
My brother...

116
00:05:41,858 --> 00:05:42,497
Rong,

117
00:05:43,418 --> 00:05:44,738
I only have you now.

118
00:06:11,377 --> 00:06:12,098
Qiubai,

119
00:06:12,858 --> 00:06:14,377
no matter what happens in the future.

120
00:06:14,858 --> 00:06:16,218
No matter what you want to do,

121
00:06:16,858 --> 00:06:18,057
Fog City and I

122
00:06:18,137 --> 00:06:19,377
will support you.

123
00:06:20,338 --> 00:06:21,697
You are also my dearest person.

124
00:06:22,338 --> 00:06:23,817
Even if I'm not here in the future,

125
00:06:24,257 --> 00:06:25,178
Fog City

126
00:06:25,377 --> 00:06:27,178
will always be your strongest support.

127
00:06:46,338 --> 00:06:46,817
Here.

128
00:06:47,257 --> 00:06:48,497
You all have it. Take your time.

129
00:06:48,697 --> 00:06:49,338
Come on, come on.

130
00:06:49,418 --> 00:06:50,617
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.

131
00:06:51,098 --> 00:06:52,457
Jingqiu, try this one.

132
00:06:52,457 --> 00:06:53,858
I loved eating this when I was a child.

133
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:55,298
Especially when it's freshly steamed.

134
00:06:55,298 --> 00:06:56,617
One bite and it'll stick to your teeth.

135
00:06:56,778 --> 00:06:57,338
No need.

136
00:06:57,937 --> 00:06:58,377
Brother,

137
00:06:58,538 --> 00:06:59,418
have a try.

138
00:07:00,218 --> 00:07:01,257
Have more yourself.

139
00:07:02,817 --> 00:07:03,497
Boring.

140
00:07:03,778 --> 00:07:05,257
You don't know how to
enjoy good food and drink,

141
00:07:05,418 --> 00:07:06,898
but to investigate.

142
00:07:07,617 --> 00:07:09,057
Youpin Weapon Workshop.

143
00:07:09,457 --> 00:07:10,377
This is one of the largest

144
00:07:10,377 --> 00:07:11,658
weapon workshops in Yishui City.

145
00:07:11,738 --> 00:07:12,577
Let's take a look inside.

146
00:07:13,697 --> 00:07:14,457
Miss,

147
00:07:14,538 --> 00:07:15,978
what weapons do you want?

148
00:07:16,298 --> 00:07:17,057
Just browsing.

149
00:07:17,418 --> 00:07:18,778
Do you sell Bloodshed Weapons?

150
00:07:19,898 --> 00:07:20,418
Well.

151
00:07:20,418 --> 00:07:21,497
Our shop really can't sell it.

152
00:07:21,617 --> 00:07:22,697
We have money.

153
00:07:22,858 --> 00:07:23,738
As long as you're willing to sell,

154
00:07:23,778 --> 00:07:24,898
we'll buy it
no matter how much it costs.

155
00:07:24,898 --> 00:07:26,098
It's not about money.

156
00:07:26,257 --> 00:07:28,658
Bloodshed Weapons
are extremely difficult to forge

157
00:07:29,338 --> 00:07:31,377
and the raw materials are rare as well.

158
00:07:31,898 --> 00:07:32,817
Not to mention our shop,

159
00:07:33,137 --> 00:07:34,338
in the entire Dragon Mountain Empire,

160
00:07:34,338 --> 00:07:35,218
there are only a few workshops

161
00:07:35,218 --> 00:07:36,218
that can forge it.

162
00:07:44,401 --> 00:07:47,703
(Kong's Weapon Workshop)

163
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,457
Please come in, dear customers.

164
00:07:51,617 --> 00:07:53,178
If I'm not mistaken,

165
00:07:53,457 --> 00:07:54,338
you all

166
00:07:54,377 --> 00:07:56,338
should be classmates of Youyue, right?

167
00:07:57,338 --> 00:07:58,418
Good, good.

168
00:07:58,457 --> 00:07:58,937
Today,

169
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,697
as long as you see a weapon you like,

170
00:08:00,697 --> 00:08:01,617
I will

171
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:03,738
give you the lowest price.

172
00:08:04,057 --> 00:08:05,257
Feel free to choose.

173
00:08:06,098 --> 00:08:08,057
Do you have Bloodshed Weapons here?

174
00:08:08,778 --> 00:08:10,738
What? Bloodshed Weapons?

175
00:08:12,377 --> 00:08:14,137
I don't know what you

176
00:08:14,137 --> 00:08:15,937
are looking for Bloodshed Weapons

177
00:08:16,298 --> 00:08:17,418
for.

178
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:19,257
We are from Changfeng Academy.

179
00:08:20,978 --> 00:08:22,057
Buying Bloodshed Weapons,

180
00:08:22,577 --> 00:08:23,658
of course, for our own use.

181
00:08:24,577 --> 00:08:25,738
For personal use.

182
00:08:26,577 --> 00:08:28,017
The Bloodshed Weapons

183
00:08:28,098 --> 00:08:29,137
have great power.

184
00:08:29,137 --> 00:08:30,738
Also, they are too destructive.

185
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:33,498
After all, you are young

186
00:08:33,498 --> 00:08:34,778
and your skills are still shallow.

187
00:08:35,178 --> 00:08:36,298
Using it recklessly,

188
00:08:36,298 --> 00:08:38,298
if you hurt your own people,

189
00:08:38,298 --> 00:08:39,778
that's not good.

190
00:08:39,857 --> 00:08:41,178
Thank you for your concern, sir.

191
00:08:41,737 --> 00:08:43,138
We're here on behalf of
Master Sikong Yang

192
00:08:43,138 --> 00:08:44,057
to ask about it.

193
00:08:44,057 --> 00:08:45,538
Recently, he's been researching these.

194
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:47,898
I see.

195
00:08:49,697 --> 00:08:51,337
It's just that these Bloodshed Weapons

196
00:08:51,337 --> 00:08:53,178
are now considered forbidden.

197
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,658
No one in the martial arts world

198
00:08:54,658 --> 00:08:56,857
dares to trade them anymore.

199
00:08:57,697 --> 00:08:58,378
For example,

200
00:08:58,378 --> 00:08:59,977
Kong's Weapon Workshop

201
00:08:59,977 --> 00:09:00,977
is the largest

202
00:09:00,977 --> 00:09:02,577
and oldest workshop in the city.

203
00:09:03,138 --> 00:09:05,538
But only for the Bloodshed Weapons,

204
00:09:05,538 --> 00:09:07,937
we really don't have them for sale.

205
00:09:08,258 --> 00:09:10,498
So, I'm afraid I have to

206
00:09:10,737 --> 00:09:13,138
disappoint the three young heroes.

207
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:15,057
Thanks for your efforts.

208
00:09:16,618 --> 00:09:17,857
You're welcome, you're welcome.

209
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:18,857
Brother, let's go.

210
00:09:21,378 --> 00:09:23,138
Then, young heroes, take your time.

211
00:09:24,577 --> 00:09:25,697
Look forward to your next visit.

212
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:29,577
(Sikong Yang is adept at spells)

213
00:09:29,577 --> 00:09:31,418
(and rarely researches alchemy weapons)

214
00:09:31,577 --> 00:09:33,057
(like Bloodshed Weapons.)

215
00:09:33,538 --> 00:09:34,658
(Just now, they stopped their words)

216
00:09:34,658 --> 00:09:35,618
(out of the blue.)

217
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:37,337
(They were clearly
trying to hide something.)

218
00:09:38,138 --> 00:09:40,498
(Could it be that Changfeng Academy)

219
00:09:40,498 --> 00:09:41,737
(started to investigate?)

220
00:09:48,885 --> 00:09:51,197
(Weapon Shop)

221
00:10:01,658 --> 00:10:03,178
We've almost asked

222
00:10:03,178 --> 00:10:04,337
all the weapon shops

223
00:10:04,457 --> 00:10:05,178
and not a single one has any clue

224
00:10:05,178 --> 00:10:06,697
about Bloodshed Weapons.

225
00:10:07,538 --> 00:10:08,138
Jingqiu,

226
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:09,418
don't be disappointed.

227
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:11,018
As long as we don't give up,

228
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,138
we'll definitely find a clue.

229
00:10:13,498 --> 00:10:14,178
Dear customers,

230
00:10:14,337 --> 00:10:15,378
our shop has top-notch

231
00:10:15,378 --> 00:10:16,378
braised lion's head meatballs.

232
00:10:16,378 --> 00:10:17,457
Would you like to
come in and have a taste?

233
00:10:18,097 --> 00:10:19,538
We've been looking for this all day

234
00:10:19,538 --> 00:10:20,817
and haven't eaten a single meal.

235
00:10:20,817 --> 00:10:22,057
How about grabbing a bite?

236
00:10:22,057 --> 00:10:23,018
I'm not hungry.

237
00:10:23,778 --> 00:10:24,298
Jingqiu,

238
00:10:24,817 --> 00:10:25,538
come on.

239
00:10:25,538 --> 00:10:27,178
Look, it's getting dark

240
00:10:27,178 --> 00:10:28,337
and we can't continue the search anyway.

241
00:10:28,337 --> 00:10:28,857
Right?

242
00:10:28,857 --> 00:10:30,097
Why don't we take a break,

243
00:10:30,097 --> 00:10:30,898
refresh ourselves,

244
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:32,057
and continue tomorrow?

245
00:10:32,378 --> 00:10:32,977
That's true.

246
00:10:33,057 --> 00:10:34,258
Let's go eat something

247
00:10:34,337 --> 00:10:35,378
and restore some strength

248
00:10:35,538 --> 00:10:36,258
before we continue.

249
00:10:37,018 --> 00:10:38,378
If you want to eat, eat by yourselves.

250
00:10:38,378 --> 00:10:39,697
I'll go look for more clues.

251
00:10:40,258 --> 00:10:43,418
The Sea God Palace
was directly breached by the demons.

252
00:10:43,778 --> 00:10:44,577
For those demons,

253
00:10:44,857 --> 00:10:47,097
each one is incredibly powerful.

254
00:10:47,498 --> 00:10:48,898
The disciples of the Sea God Palace,

255
00:10:48,898 --> 00:10:50,138
in front of them,

256
00:10:50,298 --> 00:10:52,778
are like eagles snatching up chicks.

257
00:10:55,258 --> 00:10:56,538
She said she wouldn't eat,

258
00:10:56,817 --> 00:10:57,977
but she ran faster than me.

259
00:10:58,898 --> 00:10:59,577
Usually,

260
00:10:59,697 --> 00:11:01,457
they hide among us,

261
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:02,937
just like you.

262
00:11:03,378 --> 00:11:04,538
So ordinary

263
00:11:04,538 --> 00:11:05,937
that you can't tell

264
00:11:05,937 --> 00:11:07,378
any difference.

265
00:11:07,817 --> 00:11:09,337
Just at the last moment

266
00:11:09,337 --> 00:11:10,418
of the battle with the Sea God Palace,

267
00:11:10,618 --> 00:11:11,457
he suddenly

268
00:11:11,577 --> 00:11:12,658
revealed his

269
00:11:12,778 --> 00:11:14,138
true demonic form.

270
00:11:15,898 --> 00:11:17,898
This old man just talks nonsense.

271
00:11:18,217 --> 00:11:18,778
He's talking as if

272
00:11:18,778 --> 00:11:20,097
he witnessed it with his own eyes.

273
00:11:20,217 --> 00:11:21,418
I even killed two demons, too.

274
00:11:21,418 --> 00:11:22,378
Did he see that?

275
00:11:22,378 --> 00:11:23,138
All nonsense.

276
00:11:23,138 --> 00:11:24,057
Thick fur

277
00:11:24,577 --> 00:11:27,057
sprouted from his chest.

278
00:11:27,498 --> 00:11:28,618
Starting from the neck

279
00:11:28,737 --> 00:11:29,577
to the arm,

280
00:11:29,577 --> 00:11:30,457
to the fingers.

281
00:11:30,737 --> 00:11:32,337
All turned into scales.

282
00:11:32,737 --> 00:11:33,577
At this time,

283
00:11:34,258 --> 00:11:35,857
a young man,

284
00:11:36,337 --> 00:11:37,498
risking his life,

285
00:11:37,538 --> 00:11:39,057
rushed toward Xiang Pangyun

286
00:11:39,217 --> 00:11:40,898
and held him back.

287
00:11:43,498 --> 00:11:44,337
This

288
00:11:44,337 --> 00:11:47,057
heroic, unparalleled young man is

289
00:11:48,057 --> 00:11:50,057
Dongbo Xueying.

290
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:51,457
Yeah.

291
00:11:51,618 --> 00:11:52,857
He's amazing indeed.

292
00:11:53,057 --> 00:11:54,178
Really incredible.

293
00:11:54,178 --> 00:11:55,577
Everyone still remembers

294
00:11:55,977 --> 00:11:56,737
back then,

295
00:11:56,977 --> 00:11:58,217
how he ventured alone into

296
00:11:58,217 --> 00:11:59,457
the Destruction Mountain Range,

297
00:11:59,697 --> 00:12:02,378
completed the quest of
the Dragon Mountain Mansion,

298
00:12:02,498 --> 00:12:04,097
and obtained the Black Iron Order,

299
00:12:04,258 --> 00:12:05,658
right?

300
00:12:06,178 --> 00:12:07,538
Dongbo Xueying

301
00:12:07,538 --> 00:12:09,258
is a true hero

302
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:11,018
of our Dragon Mountain Empire.

303
00:12:11,498 --> 00:12:14,498
Young and accomplished.
Brave and fearless.

304
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:17,658
With his genius abilities,

305
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:19,258
becoming a Transcendent

306
00:12:19,258 --> 00:12:20,977
isn't a problem at all.

307
00:12:21,498 --> 00:12:22,577
Sadly,

308
00:12:22,937 --> 00:12:24,898
heaven envies talent.

309
00:12:25,097 --> 00:12:27,457
He was dragged by Xiang Pangyun

310
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,937
alive

311
00:12:28,937 --> 00:12:30,618
to the bottom of the Black Wind Cliff.

312
00:12:31,258 --> 00:12:33,258
A young hero,

313
00:12:33,898 --> 00:12:34,977
just like that,

314
00:12:35,178 --> 00:12:38,538
died young.

315
00:12:39,778 --> 00:12:40,618
(Xueying,)

316
00:12:41,418 --> 00:12:42,977
(I know you must still be alive.)

317
00:12:43,457 --> 00:12:44,337
(I didn't expect)

318
00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:45,898
(he would be so awe-inspiring)

319
00:12:46,057 --> 00:12:47,538
(in everyone's mind.)

320
00:12:47,737 --> 00:12:48,418
Old man,

321
00:12:48,778 --> 00:12:50,378
you just talk nonsense.

322
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:51,898
The living ones are heroes,

323
00:12:51,977 --> 00:12:52,857
while the dead ones

324
00:12:52,898 --> 00:12:53,898
are all useless,

325
00:12:54,337 --> 00:12:54,977
understand?

326
00:12:54,977 --> 00:12:55,778
Si Borong!

327
00:12:56,457 --> 00:12:57,097
What are you talking about?

328
00:12:57,097 --> 00:12:57,857
Who is this person?

329
00:12:57,857 --> 00:12:58,898
You're the one talking nonsense.

330
00:12:58,977 --> 00:12:59,418
Yeah.

331
00:13:00,057 --> 00:13:00,737
What do you mean?

332
00:13:00,778 --> 00:13:01,658
Why are you talking nonsense?

333
00:13:03,457 --> 00:13:04,138
Well, what about you?

334
00:13:05,097 --> 00:13:06,937
All you care about is eating.

335
00:13:07,337 --> 00:13:09,178
No wonder
your martial arts skills never improve.

336
00:13:09,457 --> 00:13:10,658
Who are you saying never improves?

337
00:13:10,937 --> 00:13:12,138
We all fought demons.

338
00:13:12,298 --> 00:13:13,258
It's just Dongbo Xueying

339
00:13:13,258 --> 00:13:14,538
who couldn't defeat them
and still pushed himself.

340
00:13:15,817 --> 00:13:17,298
Mind your own business first.

341
00:13:17,737 --> 00:13:19,178
You are unqualified
to criticize Xueying.

342
00:13:19,457 --> 00:13:20,258
Si Borong!

343
00:13:21,337 --> 00:13:22,337
You only know to eat

344
00:13:22,337 --> 00:13:23,697
and how to talk nonsense every day.

345
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,618
Apologize to Xueying and Jingqiu!

346
00:13:34,577 --> 00:13:35,418
I'm sorry.

347
00:14:03,618 --> 00:14:04,498
Xueying?

348
00:14:09,018 --> 00:14:09,697
Jingqiu.

349
00:14:10,258 --> 00:14:11,057
Xueying.

350
00:14:32,097 --> 00:14:33,217
Are you still there?

351
00:14:41,498 --> 00:14:42,057
Brother,

352
00:14:42,658 --> 00:14:43,258
why did you

353
00:14:43,258 --> 00:14:44,658
make me apologize to her?

354
00:14:44,898 --> 00:14:47,138
Yu Jingqiu, for Dongbo Xueying,

355
00:14:47,138 --> 00:14:48,457
almost fought me.

356
00:14:49,018 --> 00:14:50,178
I just said

357
00:14:50,178 --> 00:14:51,378
that Dongbo Xueying

358
00:14:51,378 --> 00:14:52,498
was killed by demons.

359
00:14:52,857 --> 00:14:54,258
Why was she so angry?

360
00:14:54,457 --> 00:14:55,618
What's so good

361
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:56,457
about this Dongbo Xueying?

362
00:14:56,778 --> 00:14:57,898
He's already gone,

363
00:14:57,937 --> 00:14:59,457
but people are still supporting him.

364
00:15:03,418 --> 00:15:04,498
What are you doing?

365
00:15:06,298 --> 00:15:07,298
If you're full in the future,

366
00:15:08,057 --> 00:15:09,018
go to bed early.

367
00:15:09,778 --> 00:15:10,418
Once

368
00:15:10,817 --> 00:15:11,817
one sleeps,

369
00:15:12,577 --> 00:15:14,018
he won't want to talk anymore.

370
00:15:15,418 --> 00:15:16,298
I'll go out for a walk.

371
00:15:50,577 --> 00:15:51,298
Jingqiu.

372
00:16:02,457 --> 00:16:03,258
Xueying,

373
00:16:05,018 --> 00:16:06,618
we joined Changfeng Academy together,

374
00:16:07,937 --> 00:16:09,138
but teachers favored you,

375
00:16:10,057 --> 00:16:11,658
giving you extra lessons,

376
00:16:13,217 --> 00:16:15,178
(xxxx)
enhancing your cultivation overnight.

377
00:16:18,778 --> 00:16:20,057
Our classmates also favored you.

378
00:16:21,217 --> 00:16:21,778
They thought

379
00:16:21,778 --> 00:16:23,737
you were the hero of Changfeng Academy.

380
00:16:24,937 --> 00:16:26,337
They made lifelong friends with you

381
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:29,778
with their sincere hearts.

382
00:16:31,618 --> 00:16:32,577
Now,

383
00:16:33,977 --> 00:16:35,737
you fell into the Black Wind Cliff,

384
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:38,817
becoming an immortal hero

385
00:16:40,217 --> 00:16:42,057
in everyone's mind.

386
00:16:44,178 --> 00:16:44,977
If at that time,

387
00:16:44,977 --> 00:16:46,057
the one who fell into

388
00:16:46,057 --> 00:16:47,258
the Black Wind Cliff was me,

389
00:16:49,498 --> 00:16:50,577
probably not many people

390
00:16:50,577 --> 00:16:51,538
would remember me.

391
00:16:53,298 --> 00:16:54,618
And in this life,

392
00:16:58,337 --> 00:17:00,178
I may never be able to surpass you.

393
00:18:12,606 --> 00:18:15,205
(Changfeng Academy)

394
00:18:24,658 --> 00:18:25,297
How is it?

395
00:18:25,578 --> 00:18:26,378
Any results?

396
00:18:27,138 --> 00:18:28,618
We've already searched everywhere,

397
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:29,537
but for the weapon shops in Yishui City,

398
00:18:29,537 --> 00:18:30,898
be they big or small,

399
00:18:30,898 --> 00:18:32,098
none have Bloodshed Weapons.

400
00:18:32,297 --> 00:18:33,737
The method of forging Bloodshed Weapons

401
00:18:33,737 --> 00:18:34,618
is extremely special.

402
00:18:34,737 --> 00:18:36,058
Ordinary alchemy workshops

403
00:18:36,058 --> 00:18:37,257
are not able to make them.

404
00:18:37,777 --> 00:18:39,257
If even the weapon shops in Yishui City

405
00:18:39,257 --> 00:18:40,378
can't do it,

406
00:18:40,618 --> 00:18:41,697
the shops in other places...

407
00:18:44,618 --> 00:18:45,257
Alright,

408
00:18:45,497 --> 00:18:46,378
you all must be tired.

409
00:18:46,578 --> 00:18:47,737
Go back and rest early.

410
00:18:48,858 --> 00:18:49,578
Yes.

411
00:18:55,378 --> 00:18:56,098
Jingqiu.

412
00:19:06,217 --> 00:19:06,937
Where is Xueying?

413
00:19:14,178 --> 00:19:15,297
Where is Xueying?

414
00:19:15,618 --> 00:19:16,578
I am asking you, "Where is Xueying?"

415
00:19:16,578 --> 00:19:17,217
Did he really

416
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:18,058
fall into the Black Wind Cliff?

417
00:19:18,058 --> 00:19:18,977
What are you shouting about?

418
00:19:19,178 --> 00:19:20,497
He fell down by himself.

419
00:19:20,618 --> 00:19:21,858
It's not like we pushed him.

420
00:19:22,017 --> 00:19:23,297
We're also very sad.

421
00:19:24,217 --> 00:19:25,178
It was the demons

422
00:19:25,418 --> 00:19:26,578
who used Bloodshed Weapons

423
00:19:26,898 --> 00:19:28,338
to greatly enhance their attack power,

424
00:19:28,338 --> 00:19:29,138
so Xueying...

425
00:19:30,297 --> 00:19:31,058
Anyway,

426
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:32,618
we will continue to investigate

427
00:19:32,618 --> 00:19:34,418
the Bloodshed Weapons

428
00:19:34,537 --> 00:19:35,898
and avenge Xueying as soon as possible.

429
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,338
That who did the Weapons get sold to

430
00:19:40,338 --> 00:19:41,497
has nothing to do with me!

431
00:19:42,138 --> 00:19:43,858
Xueying, in order to protect us,

432
00:19:43,977 --> 00:19:45,178
fought the demons with his life.

433
00:19:45,178 --> 00:19:46,537
He didn't even care about his own life.

434
00:19:46,658 --> 00:19:48,457
You all are safe and sound,

435
00:19:48,457 --> 00:19:49,737
but you still dare to come back.

436
00:19:49,818 --> 00:19:51,017
What are you doing, Puyang Bo?

437
00:19:51,338 --> 00:19:52,697
We've looked into everything we should.

438
00:19:52,737 --> 00:19:53,697
All the weapon shops

439
00:19:53,697 --> 00:19:54,937
don't have Bloodshed Weapons.

440
00:19:54,977 --> 00:19:56,378
Do you think demons will only

441
00:19:56,378 --> 00:19:57,457
yell like you?

442
00:19:57,457 --> 00:19:58,937
Does yelling give you clues?

443
00:19:59,537 --> 00:20:00,737
Then keep looking.

444
00:20:00,737 --> 00:20:01,658
Keep investigating!

445
00:20:01,658 --> 00:20:02,418
Look into it!

446
00:20:03,098 --> 00:20:03,858
Xueying

447
00:20:04,058 --> 00:20:04,777
promised

448
00:20:04,777 --> 00:20:06,098
we'd all come back together, didn't he?

449
00:20:06,098 --> 00:20:07,457
Why did we all come back,

450
00:20:07,457 --> 00:20:08,977
but he didn't?

451
00:20:11,058 --> 00:20:12,017
What happened?

452
00:20:12,138 --> 00:20:13,257
Even a coward like Puyang Bo

453
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,017
is losing his temper.

454
00:20:14,098 --> 00:20:15,737
It's because Dongbo Xueying

455
00:20:15,777 --> 00:20:17,058
fell off the Black Wind Cliff

456
00:20:17,457 --> 00:20:18,658
and probably can't survive.

457
00:20:18,697 --> 00:20:19,418
Weren't they going to

458
00:20:19,418 --> 00:20:20,658
find clues about the demons?

459
00:20:20,658 --> 00:20:21,858
It seems they didn't find anything.

460
00:20:21,898 --> 00:20:23,418
Usually, aren't they very capable?

461
00:20:23,578 --> 00:20:24,537
Now, they don't dare

462
00:20:24,537 --> 00:20:25,378
or can't do it?

463
00:20:31,058 --> 00:20:31,697
Hang in there.

464
00:20:31,937 --> 00:20:32,537
Stand firm.

465
00:20:34,138 --> 00:20:35,257
I don't want to practice anymore.

466
00:20:35,257 --> 00:20:36,138
Keep practicing.

467
00:20:36,338 --> 00:20:37,618
You can't even master the basics.

468
00:20:37,697 --> 00:20:38,378
In our Si Family,

469
00:20:38,378 --> 00:20:39,818
there is no one so bad at martial arts.

470
00:20:41,662 --> 00:20:45,508
(Si Mansion)

471
00:20:49,497 --> 00:20:50,497
After practicing for so long,

472
00:20:50,497 --> 00:20:51,618
the skill of using the Wild Wind Blade

473
00:20:51,618 --> 00:20:53,138
is still just so-so.

474
00:21:02,737 --> 00:21:03,418
(No.)

475
00:21:03,578 --> 00:21:04,737
(Who says I can't do it?)

476
00:21:04,818 --> 00:21:06,098
(Who says I can't find it?)

477
00:21:06,217 --> 00:21:07,098
(I'm not weak.)

478
00:21:07,338 --> 00:21:08,098
(No!)

479
00:21:10,178 --> 00:21:10,858
Situ Hong!

480
00:21:12,297 --> 00:21:13,658
Situ Hong, what are you doing?

481
00:21:13,737 --> 00:21:14,178
You.

482
00:21:14,578 --> 00:21:15,697
Instead of saving Dongbo Xueying,

483
00:21:15,697 --> 00:21:16,858
what are you showing off here for?

484
00:21:16,858 --> 00:21:18,378
Sure, I will continue to investigate.

485
00:21:19,578 --> 00:21:20,537
But if you want to keep

486
00:21:20,537 --> 00:21:21,497
gossiping,

487
00:21:22,658 --> 00:21:24,017
I will tear your mouths apart.

488
00:21:24,138 --> 00:21:24,618
You.

489
00:21:25,777 --> 00:21:26,537
Stop looking.

490
00:21:26,777 --> 00:21:27,858
Isn't the lesson enough?

491
00:21:28,058 --> 00:21:28,578
Disperse.

492
00:21:28,818 --> 00:21:29,818
Disperse, disperse.

493
00:21:37,297 --> 00:21:37,858
Sis.

494
00:21:38,098 --> 00:21:38,658
Sis, Sis,

495
00:21:38,977 --> 00:21:39,937
are you okay?

496
00:21:40,217 --> 00:21:41,058
I'm fine, I'm fine.

497
00:21:41,058 --> 00:21:42,618
W-Where are you going?

498
00:21:42,898 --> 00:21:44,457
I'm going to save Xueying.

499
00:21:44,578 --> 00:21:44,977
Save...

500
00:21:45,217 --> 00:21:46,058
Save...

501
00:21:46,497 --> 00:21:47,658
H-How do you save?

502
00:21:47,697 --> 00:21:49,578
Are you going to
jump off the Black Wind Cliff too?

503
00:21:49,737 --> 00:21:50,898
Leaving me and our father behind?

504
00:21:50,898 --> 00:21:51,457
I...

505
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:53,297
I...

506
00:21:53,338 --> 00:21:54,017
Alright, alright.

507
00:21:54,017 --> 00:21:55,058
Take a seat. Take a seat.

508
00:22:04,138 --> 00:22:05,378
You still keep this?

509
00:22:05,858 --> 00:22:06,658
Of course.

510
00:22:08,297 --> 00:22:09,578
Do you still remember
when we were little,

511
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,697
every time our father came back,

512
00:22:11,217 --> 00:22:13,178
he would bring back conches and shells.

513
00:22:13,578 --> 00:22:15,178
You always let me choose first.

514
00:22:15,697 --> 00:22:17,777
I would pick the biggest conch

515
00:22:17,898 --> 00:22:19,138
and you wouldn't get angry.

516
00:22:19,697 --> 00:22:20,578
Then, you just took

517
00:22:20,578 --> 00:22:21,578
all the remaining ones away.

518
00:22:21,937 --> 00:22:23,257
You always told me,

519
00:22:23,618 --> 00:22:25,898
not to give up the whole beach of conchs

520
00:22:25,898 --> 00:22:28,858
for a big conch.

521
00:22:34,858 --> 00:22:36,178
So this time,

522
00:22:36,578 --> 00:22:37,937
don't give up

523
00:22:38,138 --> 00:22:39,058
the other shells

524
00:22:39,338 --> 00:22:41,418
for this conch,

525
00:22:41,578 --> 00:22:42,098
alright?

526
00:22:44,257 --> 00:22:45,297
But,

527
00:22:46,098 --> 00:22:47,138
Xueying

528
00:22:47,378 --> 00:22:48,898
is not a conch.

529
00:22:50,898 --> 00:22:51,457
He...

530
00:22:52,537 --> 00:22:54,937
He is my one and only shell.

531
00:22:57,818 --> 00:23:00,058
So, mortals practice
relying on themselves.

532
00:23:00,098 --> 00:23:01,658
We can do nothing but
continuously improve our martial arts.

533
00:23:01,977 --> 00:23:03,618
If you want to become Transcendents,

534
00:23:03,618 --> 00:23:05,378
you need to mobilize
the power of heaven and earth.

535
00:23:05,977 --> 00:23:06,858
So,

536
00:23:07,098 --> 00:23:08,457
what is the real goal

537
00:23:08,457 --> 00:23:09,257
of becoming Transcendents?

538
00:23:09,378 --> 00:23:10,418
Who wants to answer?

539
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:11,898
Let Puyang Bo answer first.

540
00:23:12,257 --> 00:23:13,618
Isn't he trying to find a Transcendent

541
00:23:13,618 --> 00:23:14,497
as his wife?

542
00:23:14,737 --> 00:23:16,017
Don't make a mistake.

543
00:23:16,457 --> 00:23:18,217
Puyang Bo, share with us.

544
00:23:19,457 --> 00:23:21,058
Transform your Dou Qi
into a Transcendent form,

545
00:23:21,977 --> 00:23:24,098
and then achieve a Transcendent body

546
00:23:24,777 --> 00:23:26,297
to become a Transcendent.

547
00:23:27,017 --> 00:23:27,737
Not bad.

548
00:23:28,058 --> 00:23:28,777
Although you

549
00:23:28,777 --> 00:23:29,858
still have a certain gap,

550
00:23:30,098 --> 00:23:31,618
since coming to our Changfeng Academy...

551
00:23:31,618 --> 00:23:33,058
Even Puyang Bo wants to practice hard.

552
00:23:33,697 --> 00:23:35,217
He wants to become a Transcendent, huh?

553
00:23:35,217 --> 00:23:36,578
This is hard to say.

554
00:23:36,737 --> 00:23:38,058
It must be because of Xueying's incident

555
00:23:38,058 --> 00:23:39,017
that stimulated him.

556
00:23:39,217 --> 00:23:40,537
When people get stimulated,

557
00:23:40,537 --> 00:23:41,418
they can do anything.

558
00:23:41,418 --> 00:23:42,297
Improving your combat ability

559
00:23:42,297 --> 00:23:43,338
in martial arts

560
00:23:43,338 --> 00:23:43,898
is also a must for you

561
00:23:43,898 --> 00:23:45,818
to become a Transcendent.

562
00:23:47,178 --> 00:23:48,098
Next,

563
00:23:48,098 --> 00:23:48,697
find

564
00:23:48,697 --> 00:23:50,138
a student with similar strengths

565
00:23:50,138 --> 00:23:51,138
to practice together.

566
00:23:51,777 --> 00:23:52,697
Challenge each other in pairs,

567
00:23:52,818 --> 00:23:53,858
groups by groups.

568
00:24:00,937 --> 00:24:01,658
Jingqiu,

569
00:24:01,937 --> 00:24:03,178
can I practice with you?

570
00:24:06,858 --> 00:24:07,618
Jingqiu.

571
00:24:20,178 --> 00:24:22,338
This is called a perfect match.

572
00:24:22,737 --> 00:24:24,058
Talented man and woman.

573
00:24:25,058 --> 00:24:25,898
Sorry,

574
00:24:26,098 --> 00:24:27,257
I didn't sleep well last night.

575
00:24:27,257 --> 00:24:28,418
My body doesn't feel good.

576
00:24:29,257 --> 00:24:30,058
Master Tan,

577
00:24:30,338 --> 00:24:31,898
I will practice after class.

578
00:24:32,297 --> 00:24:33,098
Are you alright?

579
00:24:33,338 --> 00:24:34,138
The most important thing in cultivation

580
00:24:34,138 --> 00:24:35,098
is the physical condition.

581
00:24:35,138 --> 00:24:36,338
You must act

582
00:24:36,338 --> 00:24:37,257
according to your own ability.

583
00:24:42,017 --> 00:24:42,977
What's going on?

584
00:24:43,217 --> 00:24:44,418
It seems that Yu Jingqiu

585
00:24:44,418 --> 00:24:46,017
doesn't want to practice with Situ Hong.

586
00:24:46,257 --> 00:24:47,378
I think so too.

587
00:24:49,098 --> 00:24:51,058
She always practices with Xueying.

588
00:24:51,898 --> 00:24:53,338
As long as they are in a group.

589
00:25:24,378 --> 00:25:25,338
(Xueying,)

590
00:25:26,418 --> 00:25:27,378
(if you're not here,)

591
00:25:27,858 --> 00:25:29,217
(I'll come to find you.)

592
00:25:29,898 --> 00:25:31,858
(Whether you're dead or alive,)

593
00:25:32,217 --> 00:25:33,697
(I will find you.)

594
00:25:47,178 --> 00:25:47,818
Master.

595
00:25:48,818 --> 00:25:49,658
What's wrong?

596
00:25:50,257 --> 00:25:51,618
I want to do something.

597
00:25:51,977 --> 00:25:53,338
I hope you could approve it.

598
00:25:53,818 --> 00:25:54,297
Say it.

599
00:25:54,697 --> 00:25:55,418
In recent days,

600
00:25:55,497 --> 00:25:56,178
we've been to

601
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:57,858
all the armories in the empire,

602
00:25:57,977 --> 00:25:58,697
but,

603
00:25:59,098 --> 00:26:00,017
nothing was found.

604
00:26:00,697 --> 00:26:01,418
I

605
00:26:01,497 --> 00:26:02,418
feel extremely guilty.

606
00:26:02,537 --> 00:26:03,457
This is not your fault.

607
00:26:03,578 --> 00:26:04,858
But as long as
there is such ironclad evidence

608
00:26:04,858 --> 00:26:05,937
as Bloodshed Weapons,

609
00:26:06,338 --> 00:26:07,537
we will definitely be able to find

610
00:26:07,537 --> 00:26:08,658
other clues.

611
00:26:09,578 --> 00:26:10,217
So,

612
00:26:10,378 --> 00:26:11,618
I want to ask

613
00:26:11,818 --> 00:26:13,138
if you could give me

614
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,017
a piece of the Bloodshed Weapon debris.

615
00:26:14,297 --> 00:26:15,497
I will investigate carefully.

616
00:26:15,777 --> 00:26:16,497
I believe

617
00:26:16,658 --> 00:26:17,937
there will be new discoveries.

618
00:26:18,777 --> 00:26:19,378
No.

619
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:21,338
Bloodshed Weapons

620
00:26:21,338 --> 00:26:22,898
are different from other weapons.

621
00:26:23,378 --> 00:26:24,537
They are destructive.

622
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:25,977
If it causes chaos

623
00:26:25,977 --> 00:26:27,017
among the disciples,

624
00:26:27,658 --> 00:26:28,658
that would be troublesome.

625
00:26:28,858 --> 00:26:30,457
For this, please rest assured, Master,

626
00:26:30,537 --> 00:26:31,658
I will definitely keep it a secret.

627
00:26:32,497 --> 00:26:33,537
I must find out

628
00:26:33,537 --> 00:26:34,178
who in Dragon Mountain Empire

629
00:26:34,178 --> 00:26:35,898
is colluding with the demons

630
00:26:36,138 --> 00:26:37,537
and avenge Xueying as soon as possible.

631
00:26:41,138 --> 00:26:42,098
Xueying.

632
00:26:53,618 --> 00:26:55,017
You must be careful.

633
00:26:59,618 --> 00:27:01,017
Be sure to protect yourself.

634
00:27:01,257 --> 00:27:02,138
Thank you, Master.

635
00:27:02,937 --> 00:27:03,858
I'll take my leave.

636
00:27:16,457 --> 00:27:17,017
Brother.

637
00:27:21,017 --> 00:27:21,777
Brother.

638
00:27:22,297 --> 00:27:23,898
Where have you been so late?

639
00:27:24,098 --> 00:27:25,217
You went out again.

640
00:27:27,937 --> 00:27:28,898
I just heard

641
00:27:28,898 --> 00:27:29,858
some noise in the courtyard,

642
00:27:30,098 --> 00:27:31,257
so I went out to take a look.

643
00:27:32,378 --> 00:27:33,257
What noise?

644
00:27:33,818 --> 00:27:35,578
You don't think it was a demon, do you?

645
00:27:35,898 --> 00:27:36,418
Brother,

646
00:27:36,818 --> 00:27:38,418
this is Changfeng Academy.

647
00:27:38,418 --> 00:27:39,338
Very safe.

648
00:27:40,297 --> 00:27:41,098
As humans,

649
00:27:41,737 --> 00:27:43,257
we should be cautious.

650
00:27:43,818 --> 00:27:45,297
You're just overthinking.

651
00:27:45,737 --> 00:27:46,858
Overthinking

652
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:48,017
makes it hard to fall asleep.

653
00:27:48,378 --> 00:27:49,737
I'll go to sleep now, Brother.

654
00:27:50,578 --> 00:27:51,297
Rest early.

655
00:28:22,858 --> 00:28:24,937
The person who let Xiang Pangyun fail.

656
00:28:25,138 --> 00:28:25,977
What's his name?

657
00:28:26,578 --> 00:28:27,697
Dongbo Xueying.

658
00:28:28,178 --> 00:28:29,977
He has been pulled down
the Black Wind Cliff.

659
00:28:30,217 --> 00:28:31,098
He can't survive.

660
00:28:32,297 --> 00:28:33,937
A student of Changfeng Academy

661
00:28:34,138 --> 00:28:35,858
actually challenged

662
00:28:35,858 --> 00:28:37,098
our Demon Clan General.

663
00:28:38,098 --> 00:28:39,898
What a pity that Xiang Pangyun died.

664
00:28:40,818 --> 00:28:42,537
After all,
he had been hiding for so long.

665
00:28:43,537 --> 00:28:44,937
But I didn't expect

666
00:28:45,217 --> 00:28:47,098
that Dongbo Xueying,
a mortal of the Xia Clan,

667
00:28:47,537 --> 00:28:48,497
actually had

668
00:28:48,497 --> 00:28:49,737
such incredible power.

669
00:28:50,138 --> 00:28:51,618
I thought Chi Qiubai

670
00:28:51,618 --> 00:28:52,537
was the strongest

671
00:28:52,537 --> 00:28:53,937
in Dragon Mountain Empire.

672
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:56,138
Xueying seems

673
00:28:56,257 --> 00:28:57,618
to be not bad either.

674
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:59,257
But it's a pity.

675
00:28:59,858 --> 00:29:02,017
Keep an eye on Chi Qiubai.

676
00:29:02,537 --> 00:29:03,537
Understood.

677
00:29:03,858 --> 00:29:04,457
Master,

678
00:29:04,858 --> 00:29:05,977
this time we successfully obtained

679
00:29:05,977 --> 00:29:07,017
the rare source stone.

680
00:29:07,257 --> 00:29:08,257
We can attack

681
00:29:08,257 --> 00:29:09,418
the Demon Well without worries now.

682
00:29:09,777 --> 00:29:10,418
However...

683
00:29:10,697 --> 00:29:11,537
However what?

684
00:29:11,937 --> 00:29:13,737
Since the last incident,

685
00:29:13,737 --> 00:29:14,537
Nanqin will definitely

686
00:29:14,537 --> 00:29:15,898
guard more stringently.

687
00:29:16,017 --> 00:29:17,297
But please rest assured, Master,

688
00:29:17,578 --> 00:29:19,257
I will arrange everything.

689
00:29:19,378 --> 00:29:20,178
Good.

690
00:29:20,697 --> 00:29:21,618
No rush.

691
00:29:22,457 --> 00:29:23,257
Silence.

692
00:29:25,697 --> 00:29:27,178
The Demon Well in Nanqin

693
00:29:27,178 --> 00:29:28,138
is unreliable.

694
00:29:28,297 --> 00:29:29,578
Our generals

695
00:29:29,578 --> 00:29:30,138
in the Dark Abyss

696
00:29:30,138 --> 00:29:31,178
are speeding up the search

697
00:29:31,178 --> 00:29:32,338
for a new well-drilling site.

698
00:29:32,737 --> 00:29:33,457
Don't

699
00:29:33,697 --> 00:29:35,138
let others know about this for now.

700
00:29:35,378 --> 00:29:35,858
Yes.

701
00:29:36,457 --> 00:29:37,737
In the battle
against the Sea God Palace,

702
00:29:37,937 --> 00:29:39,818
the Abyss Demons were all killed.

703
00:29:40,178 --> 00:29:41,737
Although the source stone is in place,

704
00:29:41,858 --> 00:29:42,858
without

705
00:29:42,937 --> 00:29:44,338
a strong power for support,

706
00:29:44,697 --> 00:29:45,777
these source stones

707
00:29:45,937 --> 00:29:47,217
are just like useless stones

708
00:29:47,457 --> 00:29:48,697
and can't play a role at all.

709
00:29:49,178 --> 00:29:50,297
Right now, the most important thing

710
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:51,737
is to gather manpower.

711
00:29:52,017 --> 00:29:53,777
Only when we find a new drilling site

712
00:29:54,257 --> 00:29:56,017
can we use the source stone

713
00:29:56,257 --> 00:29:57,457
and the strong manpower

714
00:29:57,578 --> 00:29:59,217
to break through the Demon Well.

715
00:29:59,537 --> 00:30:01,297
Making the Demon Well
and delivering my coffin.

716
00:30:01,737 --> 00:30:02,737
The time for coming back

717
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:04,378
is around the corner.

718
00:30:06,178 --> 00:30:07,977
You will become the ruler of

719
00:30:07,977 --> 00:30:08,898
Dragon Mountain Empire for sure, Master.

720
00:30:09,297 --> 00:30:11,257
Now it's time to put Third Priest

721
00:30:11,257 --> 00:30:12,378
into service.

722
00:30:12,497 --> 00:30:13,058
Yes.

723
00:30:13,818 --> 00:30:15,818
You need to cooperate with High Priest.

724
00:30:16,098 --> 00:30:16,977
Although

725
00:30:17,017 --> 00:30:18,058
he is not from

726
00:30:18,058 --> 00:30:19,217
Dark Abyss,

727
00:30:19,257 --> 00:30:20,898
as we are now

728
00:30:20,898 --> 00:30:22,098
in the Xia Clan,

729
00:30:22,257 --> 00:30:24,378
we need more people
like them from the Xia Clan

730
00:30:24,378 --> 00:30:25,858
to serve us.

731
00:30:26,777 --> 00:30:27,937
Understood.

732
00:30:28,618 --> 00:30:30,297
I will definitely make them

733
00:30:30,858 --> 00:30:32,378
work for our Demon Clan.

734
00:30:34,178 --> 00:30:36,257
Learn from the previous mistakes
on the demons' matter.

735
00:30:36,418 --> 00:30:38,257
Lack of manpower and strength,

736
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,497
we will make efforts
for nothing again in the end.

737
00:30:39,697 --> 00:30:40,178
Master,

738
00:30:40,418 --> 00:30:41,977
we lost almost all the manpower

739
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:42,977
we had gathered

740
00:30:42,977 --> 00:30:44,537
in the previous battles against Fog City

741
00:30:44,537 --> 00:30:46,017
and the Sea God Palace.

742
00:30:46,257 --> 00:30:46,697
Now...

743
00:30:46,697 --> 00:30:48,658
Now we need new power.

744
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:50,937
We need you and Second Priest

745
00:30:50,937 --> 00:30:52,098
to collaborate.

746
00:30:53,257 --> 00:30:54,098
Right now,

747
00:30:54,497 --> 00:30:55,178
it is difficult for us

748
00:30:55,178 --> 00:30:56,297
to mobilize manpower

749
00:30:56,297 --> 00:30:57,257
from the Dark Abyss again.

750
00:30:58,017 --> 00:30:58,977
In my opinion,

751
00:30:59,418 --> 00:31:01,257
the disciples of
Changfeng Academy are not bad.

752
00:31:01,737 --> 00:31:02,818
Why not capture them all

753
00:31:02,818 --> 00:31:03,737
and make them demons?

754
00:31:03,898 --> 00:31:05,497
Make them our Black Armored Warriors

755
00:31:06,098 --> 00:31:07,217
for our use.

756
00:31:08,098 --> 00:31:10,017
As long as Second Priest
can bring them here,

757
00:31:10,378 --> 00:31:12,777
leave the rest to me.

758
00:31:16,217 --> 00:31:17,578
Go and observe them carefully.

759
00:31:18,138 --> 00:31:19,858
Learn their daily routines

760
00:31:20,457 --> 00:31:22,017
and travel patterns.

761
00:31:44,697 --> 00:31:45,338
Brother.

762
00:31:55,737 --> 00:31:56,418
Brother.

763
00:32:02,578 --> 00:32:03,497
Qingshi.

764
00:32:05,818 --> 00:32:06,737
I'm sorry.

765
00:32:07,418 --> 00:32:09,217
I didn't protect your brother well.

766
00:32:17,497 --> 00:32:18,378
Qingshi.

767
00:32:19,378 --> 00:32:20,257
Don't worry.

768
00:32:21,658 --> 00:32:22,537
We will definitely

769
00:32:22,537 --> 00:32:23,858
avenge your brother.

770
00:32:34,257 --> 00:32:35,257
Demon Clan.

771
00:32:52,457 --> 00:32:53,418
Thank you all.

772
00:32:54,737 --> 00:32:55,697
I'll take my leave.

773
00:33:05,834 --> 00:33:08,171
(Xueying Territory)

774
00:33:19,017 --> 00:33:19,658
Shi.

775
00:33:20,138 --> 00:33:21,338
This is...?

776
00:33:22,217 --> 00:33:23,737
Hello, my name is Ji Rong.

777
00:33:24,178 --> 00:33:25,418
I am also a disciple of

778
00:33:25,418 --> 00:33:26,098
Master Bai Yuanzhi.

779
00:33:26,737 --> 00:33:27,737
Ji Rong.

780
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:29,578
Why did you come back?

781
00:33:33,338 --> 00:33:33,937
Shi.

782
00:33:35,217 --> 00:33:36,058
What happened?

783
00:33:38,777 --> 00:33:40,098
What happened? Speak up.

784
00:33:40,178 --> 00:33:41,338
Tell us.

785
00:33:43,457 --> 00:33:44,098
Uncle Zong,

786
00:33:45,737 --> 00:33:46,497
Uncle Tong San.

787
00:33:50,858 --> 00:33:52,658
Brother fell down the Black Wind Cliff

788
00:33:53,737 --> 00:33:54,497
and died.

789
00:34:15,165 --> 00:34:17,752
(In Memory of Dongbo Xueying)

790
00:35:04,417 --> 00:35:05,217
This is your brother's

791
00:35:05,217 --> 00:35:06,417
torn clothes.

792
00:35:06,618 --> 00:35:07,897
I sewed it up for you.

793
00:35:13,618 --> 00:35:14,297
Thank you.

794
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:16,538
It's nothing.

795
00:35:17,458 --> 00:35:18,297
As long as it makes you

796
00:35:18,297 --> 00:35:19,618
feel better.

797
00:35:22,098 --> 00:35:22,897
I will try.

798
00:35:24,217 --> 00:35:25,618
Don't get me wrong.

799
00:35:25,978 --> 00:35:27,178
I didn't ask you

800
00:35:27,178 --> 00:35:28,417
to force yourself.

801
00:35:29,257 --> 00:35:31,377
I know the pain of losing a loved one.

802
00:35:32,618 --> 00:35:34,377
But since it happened,

803
00:35:34,978 --> 00:35:36,297
we can only face it bravely,

804
00:35:36,297 --> 00:35:37,018
right?

805
00:35:37,538 --> 00:35:38,938
When my brother was around,

806
00:35:40,458 --> 00:35:42,018
he wouldn't let me do anything.

807
00:35:44,058 --> 00:35:45,337
Every time there was danger,

808
00:35:46,697 --> 00:35:48,337
he would stand in front of me.

809
00:35:49,098 --> 00:35:50,337
He thought I didn't understand,

810
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,257
but actually,
I knew everything in my heart.

811
00:35:55,697 --> 00:35:57,138
Now that he's gone,

812
00:35:59,737 --> 00:36:01,098
it's really just me

813
00:36:01,098 --> 00:36:02,257
facing this world.

814
00:36:04,058 --> 00:36:04,938
I really feel

815
00:36:05,897 --> 00:36:07,257
a little scared.

816
00:36:07,817 --> 00:36:08,857
What's there to be afraid of?

817
00:36:09,257 --> 00:36:10,817
You still have Uncle Tong San

818
00:36:10,938 --> 00:36:11,857
and Uncle Zong Ling.

819
00:36:12,297 --> 00:36:13,217
The entire Xueying Territory

820
00:36:13,217 --> 00:36:14,777
is your strong support.

821
00:36:15,777 --> 00:36:16,737
Besides,

822
00:36:18,978 --> 00:36:20,257
you still have me.

823
00:36:21,538 --> 00:36:23,178
I will always be with you.

824
00:36:29,098 --> 00:36:29,938
You're right.

825
00:36:30,377 --> 00:36:31,018
Ji Rong,

826
00:36:32,697 --> 00:36:33,857
I have to cheer up.

827
00:36:35,978 --> 00:36:37,377
I must cheer up.

828
00:37:06,737 --> 00:37:08,337
(Since she saved you at that time,)

829
00:37:08,817 --> 00:37:10,217
(you are not destined to die.)

830
00:37:10,697 --> 00:37:11,697
(Don't give up.)

831
00:38:34,098 --> 00:38:34,857
Jingqiu.

832
00:38:35,498 --> 00:38:36,138
Is that you?

833
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:40,538
It's me.

834
00:39:04,817 --> 00:39:06,297
If only this were true.

835
00:39:07,857 --> 00:39:08,737
Then, do you

836
00:39:08,737 --> 00:39:10,618
often dream of me?

837
00:39:12,417 --> 00:39:13,217
My first time.

838
00:39:16,458 --> 00:39:17,857
Then this doesn't count
as the first time.

839
00:39:20,178 --> 00:39:21,417
Why isn't it the first time?

840
00:39:25,538 --> 00:39:26,058
This...

841
00:39:27,377 --> 00:39:28,337
This is not a dream?

842
00:39:29,058 --> 00:39:29,978
Of course.

843
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:32,217
You are still alive.

844
00:39:32,618 --> 00:39:33,938
We are still together.

845
00:39:34,658 --> 00:39:35,737
How did you get in?

846
00:39:35,978 --> 00:39:36,978
Are you hurt?

847
00:39:38,138 --> 00:39:39,018
Well,

848
00:39:39,337 --> 00:39:40,978
is it appropriate for us to chat

849
00:39:41,217 --> 00:39:42,257
in the air?

850
00:39:47,817 --> 00:39:48,297
Let's go.

851
00:39:52,737 --> 00:39:53,978
They all said

852
00:39:54,417 --> 00:39:56,377
after you fell down
the Black Wind Cliff,

853
00:39:56,377 --> 00:39:57,417
you were bound to die.

854
00:39:58,297 --> 00:39:59,417
But I believe...

855
00:39:59,897 --> 00:40:00,817
I believe you wouldn't

856
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,257
die so easily.

857
00:40:04,217 --> 00:40:05,938
I found this in the Treasure Pavilion.

858
00:40:06,138 --> 00:40:07,297
With the help of the Lotus Lamp,

859
00:40:07,297 --> 00:40:08,458
we can resist the airflow.

860
00:40:15,257 --> 00:40:17,257
(Black Wind Cliff has strong currents.)

861
00:40:17,257 --> 00:40:18,578
(So deep that
it's hard to measure the depth)

862
00:40:19,098 --> 00:40:20,857
(Those who fall in
have a slim chance of survival.)

863
00:40:22,938 --> 00:40:24,777
(The Lotus Lamp will bloom like a lotus)

864
00:40:24,777 --> 00:40:26,618
(when encountering a strong current)

865
00:40:26,817 --> 00:40:27,857
(to resist the airflow.)

866
00:40:48,897 --> 00:40:49,817
Xueying.

867
00:40:51,058 --> 00:40:52,138
Xueying.

868
00:41:12,098 --> 00:41:12,817
And then?

869
00:41:14,498 --> 00:41:15,417
Then...

870
00:41:15,857 --> 00:41:16,978
Then we...

871
00:41:22,618 --> 00:41:23,697
I'm hungry.

872
00:41:27,498 --> 00:41:28,697
I'm hungry too.

873
00:41:29,018 --> 00:41:29,938
What do you want to eat?

874
00:41:30,498 --> 00:41:32,058
Is there anything good to eat here?

875
00:41:42,498 --> 00:41:43,978
The fish escaped again.

876
00:41:44,578 --> 00:41:45,178
There are more over there.

877
00:41:45,178 --> 00:41:45,538
Alright.

878
00:41:59,578 --> 00:42:00,938
You missed it again.

879
00:42:15,257 --> 00:42:15,817
Over there.

880
00:42:29,618 --> 00:42:30,417
