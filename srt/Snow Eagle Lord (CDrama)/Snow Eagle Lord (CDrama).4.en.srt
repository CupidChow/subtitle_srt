=Episode 4=

21
00:01:47,322 --> 00:01:49,602
When I was fighting with you
in Snow Stone Fort,

22
00:01:49,721 --> 00:01:50,481
I saw something

23
00:01:50,481 --> 00:01:51,602
rather strange.

24
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:53,522
Do you know the reason?

25
00:01:54,561 --> 00:01:55,441
What?

26
00:01:56,921 --> 00:01:58,522
It seemed to be about my parents.

27
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,641
I don't even know

28
00:02:02,762 --> 00:02:03,841
my parents.

29
00:02:05,162 --> 00:02:06,081
How would I know

30
00:02:06,162 --> 00:02:07,641
anything about your parents?

31
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:10,321
Please, I beg you.

32
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:11,962
Spare me, please.

33
00:02:12,362 --> 00:02:14,281
I've ended up like this.

34
00:02:14,402 --> 00:02:15,682
Please let me go.

35
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:16,881
Let me go.

36
00:02:17,122 --> 00:02:17,922
Take him away.

37
00:02:18,001 --> 00:02:18,601
Yes.

38
00:02:51,802 --> 00:02:52,441
Brother.

39
00:02:53,761 --> 00:02:54,601
Brother.

40
00:02:59,841 --> 00:03:00,522
Brother.

41
00:03:01,321 --> 00:03:02,202
Uncle Zong Ling.

42
00:03:02,321 --> 00:03:03,082
- Shi.
- How is he?

43
00:03:03,082 --> 00:03:03,962
So badly injured?

44
00:03:04,242 --> 00:03:05,082
He's okay.

45
00:03:07,561 --> 00:03:08,522
(Brother.)

46
00:03:10,321 --> 00:03:11,441
(I'm really useless.)

47
00:03:11,682 --> 00:03:13,161
(I can't help with anything.)

48
00:03:13,962 --> 00:03:15,682
(So you have to take risks)

49
00:03:16,402 --> 00:03:17,802
(and suffer alone.)

50
00:03:19,082 --> 00:03:20,402
Come on, he's fine.

51
00:03:21,082 --> 00:03:22,041
Calm down.

52
00:03:25,161 --> 00:03:26,922
Uncle Zong.

53
00:03:27,802 --> 00:03:29,642
Uncle Zong.

54
00:03:31,601 --> 00:03:32,561
Tell me.

55
00:03:32,802 --> 00:03:33,482
Did he go to

56
00:03:33,482 --> 00:03:34,441
save my mother alone?

57
00:03:38,041 --> 00:03:39,041
I knew it.

58
00:03:40,041 --> 00:03:40,922
It was a lie that

59
00:03:41,001 --> 00:03:42,482
Lord Si An didn't tell him

60
00:03:43,161 --> 00:03:44,522
where my mother was.

61
00:03:45,482 --> 00:03:46,362
He didn't want you

62
00:03:46,482 --> 00:03:47,642
to take the risk with him.

63
00:03:47,962 --> 00:03:49,482
He even got us fooled.

64
00:03:50,001 --> 00:03:51,281
If we hadn't discovered the truth

65
00:03:51,402 --> 00:03:52,561
and rushed there,

66
00:03:53,362 --> 00:03:54,962
he would have died.

67
00:03:55,082 --> 00:03:56,001
So, Shi.

68
00:03:56,682 --> 00:03:58,161
Don't blame him.

69
00:03:59,082 --> 00:04:00,482
I'm not blaming him.

70
00:04:01,881 --> 00:04:03,321
I'm blaming myself.

71
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,001
If I weren't so weak

72
00:04:06,841 --> 00:04:08,122
and useless,

73
00:04:08,721 --> 00:04:09,402
he wouldn't

74
00:04:09,402 --> 00:04:10,561
get hurt like this.

75
00:04:10,962 --> 00:04:12,001
It's my fault.

76
00:04:13,122 --> 00:04:14,161
I'm so useless.

77
00:04:14,161 --> 00:04:15,041
Shi.

78
00:04:16,162 --> 00:04:17,802
Come back.

79
00:04:18,362 --> 00:04:19,682
What's wrong with you?

80
00:04:28,881 --> 00:04:30,282
Ge Bin has been wanted for years.

81
00:04:30,401 --> 00:04:31,802
Now he's involved with the Demon Clan.

82
00:04:31,922 --> 00:04:34,242
The credibility of his words
remains questionable.

83
00:04:34,362 --> 00:04:35,081
That's right.

84
00:04:35,201 --> 00:04:36,802
We've been interrogating him for so long

85
00:04:36,881 --> 00:04:38,561
and haven't gotten anything useful.

86
00:04:39,081 --> 00:04:39,842
I don't think

87
00:04:39,961 --> 00:04:41,842
we should keep wasting time on him.

88
00:04:41,961 --> 00:04:44,242
Let's kill him as a warning to others.

89
00:04:47,081 --> 00:04:48,842
Ge Bin is truly a villain.

90
00:04:48,961 --> 00:04:51,242
But it'd be a bit reckless to kill him.

91
00:04:51,401 --> 00:04:53,362
He can serve other purposes alive.

92
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:55,001
Like what?

93
00:04:55,362 --> 00:04:57,282
We can probe the Demon Clan.

94
00:04:57,401 --> 00:04:58,961
Maybe the Gray Robe he mentioned

95
00:04:59,081 --> 00:05:00,242
will show up again.

96
00:05:00,842 --> 00:05:01,961
Good point.

97
00:05:02,122 --> 00:05:03,001
The Demon Clan

98
00:05:03,122 --> 00:05:04,441
wouldn't let Ge Bin be.

99
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:05,842
Besides,

100
00:05:06,001 --> 00:05:08,001
we can't keep him
at Dragon Mountain Mansion.

101
00:05:08,162 --> 00:05:10,521
We might as well
take him to Water Daoist Temple.

102
00:05:10,722 --> 00:05:12,122
Maybe someone will

103
00:05:12,242 --> 00:05:13,561
come after him.

104
00:05:14,201 --> 00:05:15,602
That's a good idea.

105
00:05:15,682 --> 00:05:16,802
Let's keep him alive.

106
00:05:16,922 --> 00:05:18,321
It gives us the chance

107
00:05:18,401 --> 00:05:19,401
to find the Gray Robe.

108
00:05:19,761 --> 00:05:21,401
I agree with Master.

109
00:05:21,641 --> 00:05:23,321
It's always been hard to track down

110
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,242
the Demon God Association.

111
00:05:25,362 --> 00:05:27,081
Ge Bin may be the breakthrough.

112
00:05:27,201 --> 00:05:28,602
I will escort him.

113
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:29,922
Okay.

114
00:05:30,122 --> 00:05:31,321
I'll go with you.

115
00:05:32,282 --> 00:05:33,081
Fine.

116
00:05:36,696 --> 00:05:40,376
(Blessings and Auspice)

117
00:05:47,001 --> 00:05:48,162
(The Demon Clan is exposed.)

118
00:05:48,282 --> 00:05:49,521
(They won't easily let go.)

119
00:05:50,441 --> 00:05:52,001
(I wonder if Fog City and Xiaoxi)

120
00:05:52,162 --> 00:05:53,401
(are prepared.)

121
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,201
Knight Changfeng.

122
00:06:11,282 --> 00:06:12,722
- Your Lordship.
- Your Lordship.

123
00:06:13,722 --> 00:06:14,842
You may leave.

124
00:06:15,162 --> 00:06:15,881
Yes.

125
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,362
The Demon Clan is ready to strike.

126
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:21,482
I came to remind you to strengthen

127
00:06:21,602 --> 00:06:23,201
the defense in Fog City.

128
00:06:23,362 --> 00:06:25,242
But it seems that you're well prepared.

129
00:06:25,441 --> 00:06:26,881
Fog City is easy to defend.

130
00:06:27,001 --> 00:06:27,722
Once we guard

131
00:06:27,722 --> 00:06:28,682
the key strongholds,

132
00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,602
the enemies can't easily enter.

133
00:06:30,722 --> 00:06:32,362
The Demon Clan is in the dark.

134
00:06:32,482 --> 00:06:34,242
It's hard to defend against them.

135
00:06:34,521 --> 00:06:35,482
Strengthen the guard

136
00:06:35,641 --> 00:06:37,042
of the Forbidden Zone of Source Stones.

137
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:38,922
We have done that.

138
00:06:39,081 --> 00:06:40,081
Besides,

139
00:06:40,201 --> 00:06:40,842
Chunyuan and I

140
00:06:40,922 --> 00:06:42,162
practice the Double Fans.

141
00:06:42,242 --> 00:06:43,441
Don't worry.

142
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:44,802
Since you're worried

143
00:06:44,922 --> 00:06:46,162
about my sister and Fog City.

144
00:06:46,282 --> 00:06:47,761
I will double-check everything

145
00:06:47,881 --> 00:06:49,362
to ensure an impeccable defense.

146
00:06:56,802 --> 00:06:58,201
The Demon Clan is cunning.

147
00:06:58,321 --> 00:07:00,242
Be very careful.

148
00:07:00,682 --> 00:07:01,441
Okay.

149
00:07:02,242 --> 00:07:03,122
Back when we fought

150
00:07:03,282 --> 00:07:04,401
the Demon Clan,

151
00:07:04,482 --> 00:07:06,482
we've been in danger too.

152
00:07:07,081 --> 00:07:08,922
It may be a tough battle.

153
00:07:09,081 --> 00:07:10,201
But I truly believe

154
00:07:10,321 --> 00:07:11,682
we can win in the end.

155
00:07:16,081 --> 00:07:16,881
Xiaoxi.

156
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:18,922
I will do my best

157
00:07:19,162 --> 00:07:20,521
to protect Fog City,

158
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,401
the Dragon Mountain Empire,

159
00:07:23,482 --> 00:07:24,561
and you.

160
00:08:03,122 --> 00:08:04,162
What are you thinking?

161
00:08:06,042 --> 00:08:07,042
Faction Leader.

162
00:08:07,802 --> 00:08:09,961
What's wrong? You seem bothered.

163
00:08:11,521 --> 00:08:12,602
I think I saw something

164
00:08:12,722 --> 00:08:14,122
about my parents.

165
00:08:14,842 --> 00:08:16,521
I heard what you said

166
00:08:16,641 --> 00:08:17,802
to Ge Bin.

167
00:08:18,602 --> 00:08:19,842
What did you see?

168
00:08:20,162 --> 00:08:22,042
When he hit me,

169
00:08:23,441 --> 00:08:25,401
I saw my younger self,

170
00:08:25,961 --> 00:08:27,881
crying and not wanting my parents to go.

171
00:08:29,001 --> 00:08:30,842
But I can't see their faces clearly.

172
00:08:31,122 --> 00:08:32,521
That's all I remember.

173
00:08:55,681 --> 00:08:57,842
It seems that
you didn't lose your memory.

174
00:08:57,962 --> 00:08:58,761
Instead,

175
00:08:58,881 --> 00:09:00,442
someone sealed it.

176
00:09:00,602 --> 00:09:02,082
Someone sealed it?

177
00:09:03,641 --> 00:09:04,521
Faction Leader.

178
00:09:04,842 --> 00:09:06,161
Can you unseal it for me?

179
00:09:06,242 --> 00:09:07,322
The person who sealed it

180
00:09:07,442 --> 00:09:08,602
was highly cultivated.

181
00:09:08,722 --> 00:09:10,521
You may be in grave danger

182
00:09:10,641 --> 00:09:12,242
if I unseal it by force.

183
00:09:14,482 --> 00:09:15,681
So,

184
00:09:16,602 --> 00:09:17,602
I will never find out

185
00:09:17,761 --> 00:09:19,401
about my parents.

186
00:09:20,722 --> 00:09:22,122
We can simply

187
00:09:23,041 --> 00:09:24,801
find this person

188
00:09:25,161 --> 00:09:26,722
and unseal your memory.

189
00:09:28,962 --> 00:09:30,761
I can't even find my parents.

190
00:09:31,161 --> 00:09:32,722
The world is huge.

191
00:09:32,842 --> 00:09:33,641
How do I find

192
00:09:33,641 --> 00:09:35,122
the person who sealed my memory?

193
00:09:38,722 --> 00:09:40,442
Don't forget that you have

194
00:09:41,641 --> 00:09:43,722
all the support
of the Water Daoist Temple.

195
00:09:45,362 --> 00:09:46,281
Faction Leader.

196
00:09:47,082 --> 00:09:48,881
Thank you for taking me in back then.

197
00:09:49,242 --> 00:09:50,082
Otherwise,

198
00:09:50,202 --> 00:09:51,881
I'd be homeless.

199
00:09:52,001 --> 00:09:53,082
Silly girl.

200
00:09:53,562 --> 00:09:54,962
You usually look so indifferent.

201
00:09:55,122 --> 00:09:55,761
How come

202
00:09:55,881 --> 00:09:57,442
you're so sentimental today?

203
00:09:58,681 --> 00:09:59,801
It's not like that.

204
00:10:02,842 --> 00:10:04,602
I just feel that it's been hard

205
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:07,161
for you to bring me up

206
00:10:07,161 --> 00:10:08,161
and educate me.

207
00:10:08,602 --> 00:10:10,161
I will repay your kindness,

208
00:10:10,281 --> 00:10:11,521
and the Water Daoist Temple

209
00:10:11,641 --> 00:10:12,881
will always be my home.

210
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:30,840
(Kong Mansion)

211
00:10:38,401 --> 00:10:39,641
- Greetings, Miss.
- Greetings, Miss.

212
00:10:39,761 --> 00:10:40,442
Keep it down.

213
00:10:40,641 --> 00:10:41,761
Don't let my father hear you.

214
00:10:43,401 --> 00:10:44,681
I'm not deaf yet.

215
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:49,801
Father.

216
00:10:50,801 --> 00:10:51,842
Oh no.

217
00:10:52,001 --> 00:10:53,921
Punishment before rewards.

218
00:10:53,921 --> 00:10:55,962
I told you it'd be risky.

219
00:10:55,962 --> 00:10:57,161
What are you mumbling?

220
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:58,881
Come inside.

221
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:06,520
(Kong Hao)

222
00:11:07,602 --> 00:11:09,122
My amazing sister

223
00:11:09,242 --> 00:11:11,242
made a ton of money again!

224
00:11:11,722 --> 00:11:12,641
If Father punishes me,

225
00:11:12,801 --> 00:11:13,962
I'll vent my anger on you.

226
00:11:14,322 --> 00:11:16,161
Let's see if you prefer fighting

227
00:11:16,281 --> 00:11:17,681
or getting beaten up.

228
00:11:19,521 --> 00:11:20,161
I...

229
00:11:21,082 --> 00:11:22,482
Ouch!

230
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:23,202
Sister.

231
00:11:25,041 --> 00:11:26,001
What's wrong with you?

232
00:11:26,041 --> 00:11:26,521
I...

233
00:11:26,521 --> 00:11:27,482
Be gentle, Sister.

234
00:11:32,122 --> 00:11:33,122
Tell me.

235
00:11:33,322 --> 00:11:34,281
What happened?

236
00:11:35,322 --> 00:11:36,122
Father.

237
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:38,641
I was heading
to a friend's place for fun.

238
00:11:39,242 --> 00:11:40,242
It's just that

239
00:11:40,242 --> 00:11:41,242
I found a business

240
00:11:41,242 --> 00:11:42,322
on the way,

241
00:11:42,521 --> 00:11:44,122
so I changed the route

242
00:11:44,761 --> 00:11:45,921
and...

243
00:11:47,001 --> 00:11:48,562
and picked up the goods.

244
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,001
Look at you.

245
00:11:50,242 --> 00:11:51,962
You're just a young girl,

246
00:11:52,242 --> 00:11:54,442
but you never learn cooking, embroidery,

247
00:11:54,562 --> 00:11:56,281
or anything a girl should do.

248
00:11:56,442 --> 00:11:58,442
You just love going out
and doing business.

249
00:11:58,761 --> 00:12:00,161
That's highly inappropriate.

250
00:12:00,322 --> 00:12:01,082
Father.

251
00:12:01,442 --> 00:12:04,362
I'm just trying to share your burden.

252
00:12:04,722 --> 00:12:06,001
I don't need that.

253
00:12:06,482 --> 00:12:07,362
Well,

254
00:12:07,482 --> 00:12:08,962
you've turned 18.

255
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,202
I think

256
00:12:10,442 --> 00:12:12,362
it's time to find you a husband.

257
00:12:13,001 --> 00:12:14,442
Leave the business

258
00:12:14,602 --> 00:12:15,521
to your little brother.

259
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:18,521
Father.

260
00:12:18,681 --> 00:12:21,122
Kong Hao has no brain.

261
00:12:21,362 --> 00:12:23,202
He only

262
00:12:23,202 --> 00:12:24,202
cares about

263
00:12:24,362 --> 00:12:27,001
weapons, martial arts,

264
00:12:27,161 --> 00:12:28,322
and fighting stuff.

265
00:12:28,562 --> 00:12:29,641
He's not meant to be

266
00:12:29,641 --> 00:12:30,842
a businessman.

267
00:12:31,001 --> 00:12:32,401
He can't even do math

268
00:12:32,521 --> 00:12:33,641
with an abacus.

269
00:12:33,761 --> 00:12:34,641
Besides,

270
00:12:34,761 --> 00:12:36,602
he's not into it at all.

271
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,122
He's not into it.

272
00:12:39,401 --> 00:12:40,602
I'll make him fond of it.

273
00:12:40,722 --> 00:12:41,881
He doesn't know math.

274
00:12:42,001 --> 00:12:43,122
I'll slowly teach him.

275
00:12:43,242 --> 00:12:44,521
There is no way

276
00:12:44,681 --> 00:12:45,362
I can't educate

277
00:12:45,482 --> 00:12:46,681
my son.

278
00:12:48,001 --> 00:12:49,041
Father.

279
00:12:49,521 --> 00:12:51,921
Those account books
don't make any sense to me.

280
00:12:52,122 --> 00:12:53,881
And they give me headaches.

281
00:12:54,001 --> 00:12:55,041
It's not meant to be.

282
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:55,921
Why bother?

283
00:12:56,082 --> 00:12:56,881
Besides,

284
00:12:57,041 --> 00:12:58,401
I only like martial arts.

285
00:12:59,041 --> 00:13:00,921
Stop making me learn how to do business.

286
00:13:02,722 --> 00:13:03,562
Yeah.

287
00:13:04,122 --> 00:13:05,602
Teach my big sister.

288
00:13:05,602 --> 00:13:06,562
She can take over

289
00:13:06,562 --> 00:13:07,562
our family business.

290
00:13:08,681 --> 00:13:10,041
Nonsense.

291
00:13:10,242 --> 00:13:11,202
Our family

292
00:13:11,202 --> 00:13:12,401
ran a business for generations

293
00:13:12,562 --> 00:13:13,401
and finally

294
00:13:13,562 --> 00:13:15,001
built what we have now.

295
00:13:15,122 --> 00:13:17,401
We run the biggest business

296
00:13:17,521 --> 00:13:19,161
in Dragon Mountain Empire.

297
00:13:19,362 --> 00:13:20,442
Why waste your time

298
00:13:20,602 --> 00:13:21,722
on martial arts?

299
00:13:22,562 --> 00:13:23,562
And you.

300
00:13:24,242 --> 00:13:26,482
Why do you care about math?

301
00:13:26,602 --> 00:13:27,442
Look at you.

302
00:13:27,562 --> 00:13:29,322
Do you know any other girl

303
00:13:29,482 --> 00:13:30,442
who hangs out with

304
00:13:30,442 --> 00:13:32,041
people from all walks of life?

305
00:13:32,881 --> 00:13:33,881
Yue.

306
00:13:34,082 --> 00:13:35,681
Be a good girl.

307
00:13:35,801 --> 00:13:36,842
Look at you.

308
00:13:36,962 --> 00:13:37,842
I will

309
00:13:37,962 --> 00:13:39,442
give you some pocket money.

310
00:13:39,602 --> 00:13:41,681
Go get some nice dresses,

311
00:13:41,842 --> 00:13:43,322
rouge, and accessories.

312
00:13:43,442 --> 00:13:44,362
Come on.

313
00:13:47,602 --> 00:13:48,322
Ouch.

314
00:13:49,482 --> 00:13:50,082
Get up.

315
00:13:52,041 --> 00:13:53,521
Let me tell you the truth.

316
00:13:53,761 --> 00:13:55,722
I know a young man

317
00:13:55,722 --> 00:13:57,482
who will make a perfect husband.

318
00:13:57,921 --> 00:13:59,122
He's quite

319
00:13:59,122 --> 00:13:59,962
capable.

320
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:02,281
And our families have been friends.

321
00:14:02,482 --> 00:14:03,761
We once

322
00:14:03,881 --> 00:14:05,881
vowed to make you a couple.

323
00:14:06,041 --> 00:14:07,521
But then,

324
00:14:07,761 --> 00:14:09,442
their family went down.

325
00:14:10,722 --> 00:14:12,521
Never mind. Forget it.

326
00:14:12,921 --> 00:14:15,521
Rest well these days.

327
00:14:15,641 --> 00:14:16,482
Then I will

328
00:14:16,482 --> 00:14:17,921
take you to visit them.

329
00:14:18,242 --> 00:14:19,001
I'm not going.

330
00:14:19,001 --> 00:14:19,641
You...

331
00:14:20,161 --> 00:14:21,001
Father.

332
00:14:21,122 --> 00:14:22,881
I've told you a million times.

333
00:14:23,041 --> 00:14:24,281
I'm not getting married.

334
00:14:24,401 --> 00:14:25,161
Besides,

335
00:14:25,281 --> 00:14:26,761
even if I do marry someone,

336
00:14:27,202 --> 00:14:28,482
I will marry

337
00:14:28,602 --> 00:14:30,041
a man I love.

338
00:14:30,242 --> 00:14:31,362
You may have

339
00:14:31,362 --> 00:14:32,482
taken vows,

340
00:14:32,722 --> 00:14:34,322
but I don't care!

341
00:14:34,482 --> 00:14:35,521
I don't!

342
00:14:35,921 --> 00:14:36,761
Yue.

343
00:14:37,161 --> 00:14:39,322
Y-Yue.

344
00:14:42,681 --> 00:14:43,602
Hao.

345
00:14:44,482 --> 00:14:45,602
H-Hao.

346
00:14:45,722 --> 00:14:46,842
Hao.

347
00:14:48,281 --> 00:14:49,602
Those kids...

348
00:14:50,082 --> 00:14:51,442
They never give me a break.

349
00:15:08,761 --> 00:15:09,442
Brother.

350
00:15:09,842 --> 00:15:10,722
You woke up?

351
00:15:16,482 --> 00:15:18,482
Xueying, how are you feeling?

352
00:15:38,521 --> 00:15:39,161
Brother.

353
00:15:39,322 --> 00:15:40,082
You're still hurt.

354
00:15:40,082 --> 00:15:41,041
Stay put.

355
00:15:41,482 --> 00:15:42,881
Uncle Zong, look.

356
00:15:57,442 --> 00:15:59,082
Uncle Zong, say something.

357
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:01,921
Uncle Tong San.

358
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:03,202
His wound hasn't healed.

359
00:16:03,281 --> 00:16:04,482
He can't go on like this.

360
00:16:04,801 --> 00:16:06,681
He needs to let off some steam.

361
00:16:06,921 --> 00:16:08,921
He's been having a hard time.

362
00:16:21,001 --> 00:16:22,482
Xueying, good child,

363
00:16:22,641 --> 00:16:23,842
listen to me.

364
00:16:23,921 --> 00:16:24,842
Your life

365
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:26,681
is my life.

366
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,801
Live well

367
00:16:28,881 --> 00:16:30,122
and don't come to save me again.

368
00:16:30,122 --> 00:16:31,161
Do you hear me?

369
00:16:31,921 --> 00:16:33,521
(It's all my fault.)

370
00:16:33,881 --> 00:16:35,281
(I was supposed to save my mother,)

371
00:16:35,482 --> 00:16:37,602
(but now my mother
risked her life to save me instead.)

372
00:17:03,442 --> 00:17:04,481
(One day,)

373
00:17:04,641 --> 00:17:05,802
(I will save my mother.)

374
00:17:05,961 --> 00:17:07,201
(I, Dongbo Xueying,)

375
00:17:07,362 --> 00:17:08,362
(will never give up.)

376
00:17:08,562 --> 00:17:09,082
Ying.

377
00:17:10,122 --> 00:17:11,362
You're injured.

378
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:12,362
You will tear

379
00:17:12,441 --> 00:17:13,481
the wound like this.

380
00:17:13,522 --> 00:17:14,921
It will take ages to heal.

381
00:17:15,002 --> 00:17:15,921
I want to break through

382
00:17:15,921 --> 00:17:17,002
Level III soon.

383
00:17:17,122 --> 00:17:18,562
But you can't do it by force.

384
00:17:19,082 --> 00:17:20,002
It's not easy

385
00:17:20,161 --> 00:17:21,961
for you to reach Level III.

386
00:17:22,082 --> 00:17:23,401
Higher levels of spear technique

387
00:17:23,481 --> 00:17:25,002
have a higher demand for Dou Qi.

388
00:17:25,562 --> 00:17:27,161
You must keep your Dou Qi steady

389
00:17:27,282 --> 00:17:28,562
to unleash the potential

390
00:17:28,721 --> 00:17:30,282
of Flying Snow Spear.

391
00:17:31,201 --> 00:17:32,161
Dou Qi.

392
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:33,241
I've already passed

393
00:17:33,241 --> 00:17:34,161
some Dou Qi to you.

394
00:17:34,322 --> 00:17:35,122
Maybe it can stimulate

395
00:17:35,122 --> 00:17:36,282
your own Dou Qi.

396
00:17:36,562 --> 00:17:38,802
Changfeng Academy welcomes you.

397
00:17:39,842 --> 00:17:40,562
That's right.

398
00:17:41,721 --> 00:17:42,401
Uncle Zong.

399
00:17:43,282 --> 00:17:44,562
I want to go to Changfeng Academy.

400
00:17:44,802 --> 00:17:46,522
Changfeng Academy?

401
00:17:47,322 --> 00:17:48,721
That's a good idea.

402
00:17:48,961 --> 00:17:50,441
Ying, you finally came around.

403
00:17:52,322 --> 00:17:53,641
But there are some guests

404
00:17:53,802 --> 00:17:55,042
you should meet now.

405
00:17:55,602 --> 00:17:56,481
Who would visit

406
00:17:56,681 --> 00:17:57,641
Xueying Territory now?

407
00:17:58,002 --> 00:18:00,401
Greet them with Uncle Tong San.

408
00:18:00,562 --> 00:18:01,961
You're the Lord of Xueying Territory.

409
00:18:02,122 --> 00:18:03,881
This is the basic manner.

410
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:16,961
(Is he)

411
00:18:17,122 --> 00:18:18,441
(the perfect husband)

412
00:18:18,481 --> 00:18:20,042
(my father has chosen for me?)

413
00:18:27,082 --> 00:18:29,842
(He looks like a radish.)

414
00:18:33,441 --> 00:18:35,122
(I'm not marrying him.)

415
00:18:38,681 --> 00:18:39,522
Young master.

416
00:18:39,681 --> 00:18:41,602
Do you have realgar,

417
00:18:41,602 --> 00:18:44,042
peppercorn, shrubby sophora,

418
00:18:44,042 --> 00:18:44,762
and moonstone?

419
00:18:44,762 --> 00:18:45,681
May I ask

420
00:18:45,681 --> 00:18:46,842
why you need

421
00:18:46,842 --> 00:18:47,641
so many herbs?

422
00:18:47,802 --> 00:18:49,522
Your master, you have no idea.

423
00:18:49,681 --> 00:18:51,322
I had a skin disease

424
00:18:51,481 --> 00:18:53,921
some days ago.

425
00:18:54,562 --> 00:18:56,161
It was super itchy.

426
00:18:56,441 --> 00:18:57,522
I think

427
00:18:57,681 --> 00:18:59,481
it's coming back these days.

428
00:18:59,641 --> 00:19:00,961
It's unbearably itchy.

429
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,042
And I heard

430
00:19:03,161 --> 00:19:04,921
that it was contagious.

431
00:19:05,082 --> 00:19:06,282
Young master, don't come

432
00:19:06,282 --> 00:19:07,082
too close.

433
00:19:07,161 --> 00:19:08,842
It's not my fault

434
00:19:09,002 --> 00:19:10,401
if you catch it from me.

435
00:19:11,282 --> 00:19:12,042
Well...

436
00:19:12,241 --> 00:19:13,201
W-Well...

437
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:14,042
Be careful.

438
00:19:14,562 --> 00:19:15,401
Youyue.

439
00:19:17,961 --> 00:19:18,881
Kong Hai.

440
00:19:19,002 --> 00:19:20,562
What are you planning to do?

441
00:19:20,721 --> 00:19:21,641
I know you love

442
00:19:21,802 --> 00:19:23,322
making friends with people in power.

443
00:19:23,481 --> 00:19:25,802
Back then, our former Lord was known,

444
00:19:26,241 --> 00:19:28,241
you pestered him to be your in-law.

445
00:19:28,802 --> 00:19:30,762
Then, we fell into trouble.

446
00:19:31,042 --> 00:19:32,522
And you shunned us.

447
00:19:33,082 --> 00:19:34,201
I was wondering

448
00:19:34,201 --> 00:19:35,842
what went wrong with you.

449
00:19:36,241 --> 00:19:38,441
You brought your sick daughter

450
00:19:39,282 --> 00:19:40,522
so that everyone here

451
00:19:40,522 --> 00:19:42,161
could be infected, huh?

452
00:19:42,282 --> 00:19:44,161
I'll teach you a lesson.

453
00:19:44,481 --> 00:19:45,641
- Leader Tong.
- Let go.

454
00:19:45,681 --> 00:19:46,362
Uncle Tong San.

455
00:19:46,362 --> 00:19:48,322
You got me wrong.

456
00:19:48,802 --> 00:19:49,842
Naughty girl.

457
00:19:50,002 --> 00:19:51,602
When have you ever
gotten any skin diseases?

458
00:19:51,762 --> 00:19:52,961
Stop messing around.

459
00:19:53,322 --> 00:19:55,282
Leader Tong, I was truly shocked

460
00:19:55,441 --> 00:19:57,721
and devastated by what happened to you.

461
00:19:58,322 --> 00:20:00,042
But life wasn't easy

462
00:20:00,042 --> 00:20:01,322
for me, either.

463
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:03,721
I've been occupied by my family business

464
00:20:03,842 --> 00:20:04,721
and couldn't visit.

465
00:20:04,881 --> 00:20:05,842
Things have barely

466
00:20:05,842 --> 00:20:06,721
gotten better for me.

467
00:20:06,921 --> 00:20:08,201
And immediately,

468
00:20:08,241 --> 00:20:10,241
I remembered my friendship

469
00:20:10,362 --> 00:20:12,082
with Mr. Dongbo.

470
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:13,322
Therefore,

471
00:20:13,522 --> 00:20:14,842
I brought my daughter here

472
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,322
for a visit.

473
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,042
Here are some gifts out of sincerity.

474
00:20:19,201 --> 00:20:20,802
Who wants your petty gifts?

475
00:20:21,042 --> 00:20:21,961
Take them away!

476
00:20:21,961 --> 00:20:23,082
Uncle Tong San.

477
00:20:24,002 --> 00:20:25,201
What's going on?

478
00:20:44,002 --> 00:20:45,441
Greetings, Uncle Kong.

479
00:20:47,201 --> 00:20:49,241
You don't have to bow.

480
00:20:49,401 --> 00:20:50,641
You've grown up.

481
00:20:50,802 --> 00:20:51,961
When you were a kid,

482
00:20:52,122 --> 00:20:53,201
I hugged you

483
00:20:53,322 --> 00:20:54,721
and bought you candies.

484
00:20:56,481 --> 00:20:59,082
I didn't expect to see you again.

485
00:20:59,481 --> 00:21:00,282
What?

486
00:21:00,681 --> 00:21:02,602
You know each other?

487
00:21:02,602 --> 00:21:04,241
We've met once, but I didn't know

488
00:21:04,362 --> 00:21:05,681
she was your daughter.

489
00:21:05,762 --> 00:21:07,441
Brother, be careful.

490
00:21:07,481 --> 00:21:08,522
This lady says she has

491
00:21:08,522 --> 00:21:09,201
a contagious disease.

492
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:09,602
No.

493
00:21:09,602 --> 00:21:10,481
No, no.

494
00:21:10,721 --> 00:21:11,881
I was joking

495
00:21:11,881 --> 00:21:13,322
with your little brother.

496
00:21:13,322 --> 00:21:14,522
That's all.

497
00:21:15,161 --> 00:21:15,961
Oh, Father.

498
00:21:16,002 --> 00:21:17,282
Didn't you prepare

499
00:21:17,282 --> 00:21:18,602
a gift for Xueying?

500
00:21:18,762 --> 00:21:19,522
Let me bring it

501
00:21:19,522 --> 00:21:20,282
to show them.

502
00:21:20,282 --> 00:21:21,161
Yes, yes.

503
00:21:21,322 --> 00:21:22,082
I almost

504
00:21:22,201 --> 00:21:23,802
forgot about it.

505
00:21:23,961 --> 00:21:24,721
These days,

506
00:21:24,921 --> 00:21:26,322
everyone in Yishui City is saying

507
00:21:26,322 --> 00:21:27,721
that Xueying has defeated Ge Bin

508
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,562
and retrieved the Ocean Realm Stone.

509
00:21:29,641 --> 00:21:32,322
You're the hero
of Dragon Mountain Empire.

510
00:21:32,681 --> 00:21:34,681
I am so proud

511
00:21:34,681 --> 00:21:35,641
of you.

512
00:21:35,802 --> 00:21:38,322
But the Bent Blade Union

513
00:21:38,322 --> 00:21:40,042
is not easy to deal with.

514
00:21:40,481 --> 00:21:41,762
The fierce battle

515
00:21:41,762 --> 00:21:43,921
must have taken a toll on you.

516
00:21:45,681 --> 00:21:46,721
So,

517
00:21:46,921 --> 00:21:48,762
I brought you

518
00:21:48,961 --> 00:21:50,762
a fine source stone

519
00:21:51,042 --> 00:21:54,082
to help you heal.

520
00:21:54,961 --> 00:21:56,881
This is a top-quality source stone.

521
00:21:57,441 --> 00:21:58,401
Ying.

522
00:21:58,681 --> 00:21:59,802
It is perfect

523
00:21:59,802 --> 00:22:01,082
for your recovery.

524
00:22:04,241 --> 00:22:05,161
Thank you, Uncle.

525
00:22:08,641 --> 00:22:09,562
We finally caught

526
00:22:09,562 --> 00:22:11,082
the thief who stole our treasure.

527
00:22:11,802 --> 00:22:12,481
Knight Changfeng.

528
00:22:12,481 --> 00:22:13,042
Let's go.

529
00:22:13,042 --> 00:22:14,481
He's a vicious man

530
00:22:14,641 --> 00:22:15,681
and the only clue

531
00:22:15,681 --> 00:22:16,681
to this case.

532
00:22:16,881 --> 00:22:18,161
Be careful.

533
00:22:18,362 --> 00:22:19,241
Thanks for the reminder.

534
00:22:19,322 --> 00:22:20,161
See you around.

535
00:22:20,201 --> 00:22:21,602
Thank you. See you.

536
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:39,802
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

537
00:22:39,802 --> 00:22:40,802
Uncle Zong Ling said...

538
00:22:40,802 --> 00:22:41,362
Dig in.

539
00:22:41,362 --> 00:22:42,762
You and my father

540
00:22:42,921 --> 00:22:44,681
had drinks whenever you met.

541
00:22:44,961 --> 00:22:45,641
Now,

542
00:22:45,842 --> 00:22:47,082
my father is gone.

543
00:22:47,681 --> 00:22:49,721
But we will enjoy the wine.

544
00:22:56,082 --> 00:22:57,522
What happened to Mr. Dongbo

545
00:22:58,122 --> 00:23:00,401
has been haunting me.

546
00:23:00,881 --> 00:23:02,241
Life is full of surprises.

547
00:23:02,401 --> 00:23:04,042
I recall the day we arranged

548
00:23:04,201 --> 00:23:05,282
the marriage

549
00:23:05,282 --> 00:23:06,602
between you and Youyue.

550
00:23:07,002 --> 00:23:09,362
It was just like yesterday.

551
00:23:09,881 --> 00:23:11,042
Arranged marriage?

552
00:23:11,201 --> 00:23:12,122
Arranged marriage?

553
00:23:12,282 --> 00:23:13,082
Yeah.

554
00:23:13,441 --> 00:23:15,441
You weren't even two years old.

555
00:23:15,842 --> 00:23:16,721
Yue was

556
00:23:16,881 --> 00:23:17,842
only one year old.

557
00:23:18,002 --> 00:23:19,522
Whoever saw you

558
00:23:19,721 --> 00:23:21,762
said you were a couple

559
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,921
of clever and sweet dolls.

560
00:23:24,082 --> 00:23:26,401
And our families
have been friends for generations.

561
00:23:26,562 --> 00:23:28,441
So we arranged for your marriage.

562
00:23:30,161 --> 00:23:31,042
But I don't think

563
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,842
my father has mentioned it.

564
00:23:33,122 --> 00:23:34,921
Maybe he wanted

565
00:23:35,042 --> 00:23:36,282
to tell you

566
00:23:36,282 --> 00:23:37,481
when you grow up.

567
00:23:37,602 --> 00:23:39,602
Then things happened.

568
00:23:39,721 --> 00:23:41,681
He never had the chance to tell you.

569
00:23:42,002 --> 00:23:43,401
However, I've never

570
00:23:43,562 --> 00:23:45,042
forgotten about it.

571
00:23:45,282 --> 00:23:46,002
Look.

572
00:23:46,161 --> 00:23:47,441
Yue just turned 18

573
00:23:47,641 --> 00:23:48,881
last month.

574
00:23:49,161 --> 00:23:51,802
And I brought her to see you today.

575
00:23:52,201 --> 00:23:53,082
Uncle Kong.

576
00:23:53,762 --> 00:23:54,522
Sorry.

577
00:23:54,842 --> 00:23:56,921
I'm afraid I'll have to disappoint you.

578
00:23:57,362 --> 00:23:58,122
Why?

579
00:23:58,721 --> 00:23:59,842
Are you

580
00:24:00,322 --> 00:24:02,681
already into someone?

581
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:03,802
I'm not in the mood

582
00:24:03,802 --> 00:24:04,762
for romance.

583
00:24:05,721 --> 00:24:07,481
Ever since my father died,

584
00:24:08,122 --> 00:24:09,241
I've been focusing

585
00:24:09,282 --> 00:24:10,481
solely on cultivation.

586
00:24:11,401 --> 00:24:12,881
You may have an agreement,

587
00:24:13,282 --> 00:24:14,481
but your daughter and I

588
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,881
are complete strangers.

589
00:24:16,401 --> 00:24:19,042
I'm afraid I won't
give her what she wants.

590
00:24:19,562 --> 00:24:21,522
Uncle Kong, she deserves a better man.

591
00:24:21,522 --> 00:24:22,161
You...

592
00:24:22,282 --> 00:24:22,921
Father.

593
00:24:23,322 --> 00:24:25,002
Stop pushing him.

594
00:24:26,602 --> 00:24:27,721
Xueying,

595
00:24:28,002 --> 00:24:29,002
I hope you can

596
00:24:29,002 --> 00:24:30,362
achieve great cultivation

597
00:24:30,762 --> 00:24:31,921
and fulfill your dream.

598
00:24:38,322 --> 00:24:41,282
Actually, marriage

599
00:24:41,401 --> 00:24:43,122
is not the top priority here.

600
00:24:43,362 --> 00:24:44,401
Look.

601
00:24:44,481 --> 00:24:46,122
The Snow Stone Fort is quite spacious.

602
00:24:46,122 --> 00:24:48,441
Why don't we let Yue stay

603
00:24:49,002 --> 00:24:50,522
and get to know you?

604
00:24:50,921 --> 00:24:52,282
I'm afraid I won't stay

605
00:24:52,282 --> 00:24:53,522
at Snow Stone Fort.

606
00:24:54,641 --> 00:24:56,122
Brother, where are you going?

607
00:24:58,241 --> 00:24:59,641
To Changfeng Academy.

608
00:25:00,082 --> 00:25:01,401
Changfeng Academy?

609
00:25:01,762 --> 00:25:02,881
Knight Changfeng

610
00:25:02,961 --> 00:25:04,562
once invited me to Changfeng Academy

611
00:25:04,602 --> 00:25:05,481
for cultivation.

612
00:25:06,201 --> 00:25:07,322
I've figured it out.

613
00:25:07,522 --> 00:25:08,641
I'm making slow progress

614
00:25:08,762 --> 00:25:10,042
all by myself.

615
00:25:10,362 --> 00:25:11,842
Practice is only one factor.

616
00:25:12,362 --> 00:25:14,241
The instruction of experts weighs more

617
00:25:14,401 --> 00:25:15,762
and will help me progress.

618
00:25:17,241 --> 00:25:18,082
Ying.

619
00:25:18,681 --> 00:25:20,322
When are you planning to leave?

620
00:25:20,602 --> 00:25:21,362
Today.

621
00:25:25,042 --> 00:25:26,842
(Changfeng Academy.)

622
00:25:27,881 --> 00:25:30,721
(Sounds like an interesting place.)

623
00:25:31,762 --> 00:25:33,562
Uncle Kong, Miss Kong.

624
00:25:33,842 --> 00:25:34,602
Take care.

625
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:38,362
Brother.

626
00:25:38,961 --> 00:25:40,122
I can't bear to leave you.

627
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:41,681
Be careful.

628
00:25:41,681 --> 00:25:42,641
Protect yourself.

629
00:25:42,721 --> 00:25:44,161
Don't get hurt again.

630
00:25:45,322 --> 00:25:47,002
Okay, I got it.

631
00:25:47,161 --> 00:25:48,481
Keep your word.

632
00:25:53,802 --> 00:25:54,721
Take care.

633
00:26:02,401 --> 00:26:03,762
I hope Xueying

634
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,802
can enter Changfeng Academy

635
00:26:06,122 --> 00:26:08,282
and get instructions
from Knight Changfeng.

636
00:26:09,082 --> 00:26:10,002
Let's go.

637
00:26:13,957 --> 00:26:15,192
(Dragon Mountain)

638
00:26:20,568 --> 00:26:24,376
(Xueying Territory)

639
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:30,401
Lord Si An.

640
00:26:30,681 --> 00:26:31,881
Dongbo Xueying.

641
00:26:32,042 --> 00:26:33,721
What brought you here again?

642
00:26:33,762 --> 00:26:34,721
Has Ge Bin

643
00:26:35,002 --> 00:26:36,881
confessed the plan of the Demon Clan?

644
00:26:36,881 --> 00:26:37,602
No.

645
00:26:38,002 --> 00:26:38,802
No?

646
00:26:39,122 --> 00:26:40,522
Where is he?

647
00:26:40,762 --> 00:26:41,762
Knight Changfeng

648
00:26:41,961 --> 00:26:43,681
and the disciples
of the Water Daoist Temple

649
00:26:43,802 --> 00:26:45,201
are escorting him to their place.

650
00:26:45,401 --> 00:26:46,721
When did they leave?

651
00:26:46,881 --> 00:26:49,282
About two hours ago.

652
00:26:52,921 --> 00:26:53,921
I'll take my leave.

653
00:26:55,762 --> 00:26:56,921
Why did you

654
00:26:56,921 --> 00:26:58,522
tell this kid

655
00:26:58,641 --> 00:26:59,881
that Ge Bin was taken?

656
00:27:01,201 --> 00:27:03,201
Don't you think this young man

657
00:27:03,201 --> 00:27:04,961
is getting really interesting?

658
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,282
He had no Dou Qi
despite ten years of cultivation.

659
00:27:09,322 --> 00:27:10,441
But once it erupted,

660
00:27:10,441 --> 00:27:11,802
he fought people of higher levels.

661
00:27:12,122 --> 00:27:13,161
Even a wanted criminal

662
00:27:13,161 --> 00:27:14,562
like Ge Bin

663
00:27:14,721 --> 00:27:15,802
was subdued by him.

664
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,802
Within a few days,

665
00:27:17,802 --> 00:27:18,481
he reached

666
00:27:18,481 --> 00:27:19,961
the level of a Meteor Knight.

667
00:27:20,161 --> 00:27:21,201
He also touched

668
00:27:21,282 --> 00:27:22,961
the demonized Ocean Realm Stone,

669
00:27:23,042 --> 00:27:24,562
but nothing happened to him.

670
00:27:24,721 --> 00:27:25,641
Besides,

671
00:27:26,562 --> 00:27:28,522
he is Moyang Yu's son.

672
00:27:28,762 --> 00:27:30,401
Your Lordship, are you saying

673
00:27:30,881 --> 00:27:33,122
that he may have...

674
00:27:33,122 --> 00:27:34,522
Let's not jump to conclusions.

675
00:27:34,721 --> 00:27:35,721
In my opinion,

676
00:27:35,921 --> 00:27:37,641
he is going to find Chi Qiubai

677
00:27:37,802 --> 00:27:39,082
to enter Changfeng Academy.

678
00:27:39,201 --> 00:27:40,201
Changfeng Academy

679
00:27:40,201 --> 00:27:41,921
cultivates Transcendents.

680
00:27:42,282 --> 00:27:43,602
Can he...

681
00:27:43,762 --> 00:27:45,641
If he truly has potential,

682
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:47,241
I believe

683
00:27:47,961 --> 00:27:50,201
he will shine one day.

684
00:28:30,082 --> 00:28:31,481
It sounds so weird.

685
00:28:31,681 --> 00:28:32,842
Let's be careful.

686
00:28:32,842 --> 00:28:34,002
Don't get tricked.

687
00:28:36,322 --> 00:28:37,401
Keep an eye on Ge Bin.

688
00:28:37,401 --> 00:28:38,282
I'll go take a look.

689
00:29:22,401 --> 00:29:23,282
Help.

690
00:29:30,762 --> 00:29:31,441
Xueying.

691
00:29:31,441 --> 00:29:32,681
Miss Yu, let me help.

692
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:11,441
Ge Bin is dying.

693
00:30:26,122 --> 00:30:27,122
Master,

694
00:30:27,322 --> 00:30:28,161
did you find

695
00:30:28,161 --> 00:30:29,201
anything suspicious?

696
00:30:30,282 --> 00:30:31,282
An Imposter Bug.

697
00:30:31,522 --> 00:30:32,362
It imitated the roar

698
00:30:32,362 --> 00:30:33,282
of a giant beast.

699
00:30:33,602 --> 00:30:34,921
I knew it.

700
00:30:35,082 --> 00:30:35,641
I guess

701
00:30:35,641 --> 00:30:37,201
it's a trap they've set up.

702
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:38,602
Someone cast a spell

703
00:30:38,961 --> 00:30:40,441
to help Ge Bin run away.

704
00:30:40,602 --> 00:30:41,961
Thankfully, Xueying helped

705
00:30:41,961 --> 00:30:43,201
and you came back in time.

706
00:30:43,282 --> 00:30:44,721
So he didn't manage to escape.

707
00:30:44,881 --> 00:30:46,562
Let's go back first.

708
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:47,322
Okay.

709
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,802
Sorry. He got away.

710
00:31:13,201 --> 00:31:14,161
Knight Changfeng.

711
00:31:14,322 --> 00:31:15,441
I'd like to join the academy.

712
00:31:15,602 --> 00:31:16,481
You're working with

713
00:31:16,481 --> 00:31:17,282
the man in black.

714
00:31:17,441 --> 00:31:18,401
Or, you work

715
00:31:18,401 --> 00:31:19,762
for the Demon God Association.

716
00:31:19,802 --> 00:31:20,562
I...

717
00:31:20,881 --> 00:31:22,401
Senior Xiuran, you got him wrong.

718
00:31:22,401 --> 00:31:23,241
I've checked him.

719
00:31:23,241 --> 00:31:24,122
He's not.

720
00:31:24,122 --> 00:31:25,082
Then why did he come

721
00:31:25,082 --> 00:31:26,082
and disappear with

722
00:31:26,241 --> 00:31:27,362
the man in black

723
00:31:27,362 --> 00:31:28,201
at the same time?

724
00:31:28,241 --> 00:31:29,122
I'm afraid

725
00:31:29,282 --> 00:31:30,282
he's been collaborating

726
00:31:30,282 --> 00:31:31,522
with the man in black.

727
00:31:31,721 --> 00:31:32,762
They failed to kill Ge Bin.

728
00:31:33,002 --> 00:31:34,241
So he helped the guy leave.

729
00:31:34,641 --> 00:31:35,842
I was obviously trying

730
00:31:35,842 --> 00:31:37,362
to catch the man in black.

731
00:31:37,522 --> 00:31:39,201
Senior, it's not like that.

732
00:31:39,201 --> 00:31:40,282
It's just a coincidence.

733
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:41,562
It doesn't go like that.

734
00:31:41,961 --> 00:31:42,602
Enough.

735
00:31:42,961 --> 00:31:44,161
Let's not stay here.

736
00:31:44,241 --> 00:31:46,241
Let's get Ge Bin back
to Water Daoist Temple first.

737
00:31:46,961 --> 00:31:48,161
He should come with him.

738
00:31:48,401 --> 00:31:49,802
He's part of it for sure.

739
00:31:49,881 --> 00:31:51,522
Okay, I'll go with you.

740
00:31:52,504 --> 00:31:55,641
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

741
00:31:55,641 --> 00:31:56,921
I'd like to meet Lord Si An.

742
00:31:57,082 --> 00:31:57,961
Who are you?

743
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,282
Who says you can just ask

744
00:31:59,282 --> 00:31:59,961
to see the Lord?

745
00:32:02,401 --> 00:32:03,721
I have the Black Iron Order.

746
00:32:10,681 --> 00:32:11,842
Dongbo Xueying?

747
00:32:12,441 --> 00:32:13,201
Come with me.

748
00:32:22,282 --> 00:32:22,881
Lord,

749
00:32:23,002 --> 00:32:24,641
Dongbo Xueying is here.

750
00:32:26,201 --> 00:32:27,241
Lord Si An.

751
00:32:31,401 --> 00:32:32,961
You brought the Black Iron Order.

752
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,602
What do you want to know?

753
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:36,961
I want to know where Moyang Yu is.

754
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:38,282
Moyang Yu?

755
00:32:38,401 --> 00:32:39,042
Yeah.

756
00:32:39,641 --> 00:32:40,602
She's my mother.

757
00:32:41,842 --> 00:32:43,641
You must be
Dongbo Xueying's little brother,

758
00:32:43,842 --> 00:32:45,122
Dongbo Qingshi.

759
00:32:47,762 --> 00:32:49,122
You stole

760
00:32:49,522 --> 00:32:50,401
this Black Iron Order

761
00:32:50,481 --> 00:32:51,401
from him, huh?

762
00:32:52,401 --> 00:32:53,362
No.

763
00:32:53,721 --> 00:32:54,201
I...

764
00:32:54,201 --> 00:32:55,481
There is a unique mark

765
00:32:55,562 --> 00:32:56,802
on each Black Iron Order.

766
00:32:56,881 --> 00:32:57,842
This one

767
00:32:58,362 --> 00:33:00,641
bears the mark of Dongbo Xueying.

768
00:33:03,002 --> 00:33:04,401
My brother's things are also mine.

769
00:33:06,441 --> 00:33:07,401
Just tell me

770
00:33:07,522 --> 00:33:08,082
where

771
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:09,241
my mother is kept.

772
00:33:09,322 --> 00:33:10,322
That's it.

773
00:33:13,362 --> 00:33:14,681
This is to teach you

774
00:33:14,961 --> 00:33:15,721
the rules

775
00:33:15,802 --> 00:33:17,161
of Dragon Mountain Mansion.

776
00:33:17,241 --> 00:33:18,122
You're in no position

777
00:33:18,241 --> 00:33:19,282
to raise your voice.

778
00:33:20,842 --> 00:33:22,161
You're too weak.

779
00:33:22,522 --> 00:33:23,441
It's like a suicide

780
00:33:23,562 --> 00:33:25,002
if you try to save her.

781
00:33:25,362 --> 00:33:27,362
Your brother
must have kept you in the dark

782
00:33:27,641 --> 00:33:28,762
because of that.

783
00:33:29,002 --> 00:33:30,681
Cultivate yourself first

784
00:33:30,961 --> 00:33:32,481
and then try to save her.

785
00:33:32,562 --> 00:33:33,481
Lord Si An.

786
00:33:33,802 --> 00:33:34,842
How on earth

787
00:33:34,921 --> 00:33:36,201
can I cultivate myself?

788
00:33:38,762 --> 00:33:40,441
Your chance lies right outside.

789
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:43,362
Look for him based on the portrait.

790
00:33:46,802 --> 00:33:47,721
Thank you,

791
00:33:47,921 --> 00:33:49,282
Lord Si An.

792
00:33:54,042 --> 00:33:54,762
Give me one.

793
00:33:56,282 --> 00:33:57,802
I want this one.

794
00:34:36,442 --> 00:34:37,042
Be careful.

795
00:34:41,042 --> 00:34:43,681
Bravo!

796
00:34:43,801 --> 00:34:44,841
Bravo!

797
00:34:44,841 --> 00:34:45,801
(Ji Rong)
See you.

798
00:34:46,641 --> 00:34:47,161
You...

799
00:34:52,442 --> 00:34:53,161
Rong.

800
00:34:54,321 --> 00:34:55,042
Master.

801
00:35:02,082 --> 00:35:04,122
It's gone. The portrait is gone.

802
00:35:04,442 --> 00:35:05,442
It's you!

803
00:35:05,721 --> 00:35:07,122
What are you talking about?

804
00:35:07,201 --> 00:35:08,602
We didn't do anything.

805
00:35:08,721 --> 00:35:10,002
Don't even try to pester us.

806
00:35:12,562 --> 00:35:13,361
Master,

807
00:35:13,602 --> 00:35:14,801
I am Dongbo Qingshi.

808
00:35:14,922 --> 00:35:16,281
Please accept me as your disciple.

809
00:35:18,442 --> 00:35:20,641
(Bai Yuanzhi)
Sorry, I don't accept disciples.

810
00:35:21,882 --> 00:35:22,841
Let's go, Rong.

811
00:35:26,482 --> 00:35:27,321
Master.

812
00:35:27,442 --> 00:35:28,281
You must be

813
00:35:28,402 --> 00:35:29,442
my destined mentor.

814
00:35:29,562 --> 00:35:30,161
I've been

815
00:35:30,281 --> 00:35:31,442
looking for you sincerely.

816
00:35:31,562 --> 00:35:32,482
Master.

817
00:35:54,641 --> 00:35:55,402
Master.

818
00:35:57,721 --> 00:35:59,042
Please accept me as your disciple.

819
00:35:59,761 --> 00:36:00,962
I would love to learn

820
00:36:01,122 --> 00:36:02,402
the ultimate truth of power.

821
00:36:02,522 --> 00:36:03,321
Master,

822
00:36:03,442 --> 00:36:04,962
please take me in.

823
00:36:05,281 --> 00:36:06,761
I no longer accept disciples.

824
00:36:07,321 --> 00:36:08,241
Go home.

825
00:36:08,562 --> 00:36:09,962
I will keep kneeling here

826
00:36:12,122 --> 00:36:13,442
until you take me in.

827
00:36:13,841 --> 00:36:15,082
Where there's a will,

828
00:36:15,201 --> 00:36:16,801
there's a way.

829
00:36:21,321 --> 00:36:22,761
Do as you wish.

830
00:36:32,792 --> 00:36:35,576
(Wind & Bamboo Pavilion)

831
00:36:39,416 --> 00:36:41,528
(Water Daoist Temple)

832
00:37:13,241 --> 00:37:14,002
Senior.

833
00:37:16,281 --> 00:37:18,241
How was the trip?

834
00:37:18,442 --> 00:37:20,002
Someone came to rescue Ge Bin.

835
00:37:20,042 --> 00:37:21,641
Unfortunately, we didn't catch him.

836
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:22,602
But we brought back

837
00:37:22,721 --> 00:37:23,641
Ge Bin's accomplice.

838
00:37:24,721 --> 00:37:25,801
Aren't you

839
00:37:25,922 --> 00:37:27,321
Dongbo Xueying?

840
00:37:28,841 --> 00:37:30,241
Ge Bin tried to get away.

841
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,002
Thankfully, Xueying came to help.

842
00:37:32,201 --> 00:37:33,122
Knight Changfeng.

843
00:37:33,241 --> 00:37:34,442
You don't know what happened.

844
00:37:34,602 --> 00:37:36,122
You weren't there.

845
00:37:36,281 --> 00:37:37,962
Was he helping us

846
00:37:38,082 --> 00:37:39,402
or up to something else?

847
00:37:39,602 --> 00:37:40,681
Maybe,

848
00:37:40,801 --> 00:37:42,681
he was helping the man in black.

849
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:44,281
Senior Xiuran.

850
00:37:44,402 --> 00:37:45,681
Do not jump

851
00:37:45,801 --> 00:37:46,721
to conclusions.

852
00:37:46,841 --> 00:37:47,641
Xueying

853
00:37:47,761 --> 00:37:48,922
is not like that.

854
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:51,681
He got away because

855
00:37:51,801 --> 00:37:52,922
I was no match for him.

856
00:37:53,522 --> 00:37:55,002
Knight Changfeng, I...

857
00:37:55,122 --> 00:37:56,562
As long as you pass the test,

858
00:37:56,761 --> 00:37:58,321
you can enter Changfeng Academy.

859
00:37:58,681 --> 00:38:00,161
I will do my best.

860
00:38:00,922 --> 00:38:02,042
He's still suspicious.

861
00:38:02,122 --> 00:38:03,122
We don't know

862
00:38:03,241 --> 00:38:05,241
his relationship with Ge Bin yet.

863
00:38:05,321 --> 00:38:06,841
Please think twice

864
00:38:06,962 --> 00:38:08,962
before accepting him, Knight Changfeng.

865
00:38:09,082 --> 00:38:10,522
If Xueying was an accomplice,

866
00:38:10,641 --> 00:38:12,122
he could have just killed Ge Bin.

867
00:38:12,281 --> 00:38:13,002
Why did he

868
00:38:13,122 --> 00:38:14,402
escort him here with us?

869
00:38:15,402 --> 00:38:16,281
Senior, why are you

870
00:38:16,361 --> 00:38:17,522
so eager to convict me?

871
00:38:17,761 --> 00:38:18,361
I...

872
00:38:18,681 --> 00:38:19,721
Then where did

873
00:38:19,721 --> 00:38:21,002
that man in black come from?

874
00:38:21,082 --> 00:38:21,761
Thankfully,

875
00:38:21,761 --> 00:38:23,042
our disciples fought back fiercely

876
00:38:23,042 --> 00:38:24,002
and kept Ge Bin there.

877
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:24,962
And you

878
00:38:25,002 --> 00:38:26,241
went after the man in black.

879
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:27,602
And he got away.

880
00:38:27,721 --> 00:38:28,562
How can you not be

881
00:38:28,562 --> 00:38:29,321
his accomplice?

882
00:38:29,321 --> 00:38:29,962
Okay.

883
00:38:30,761 --> 00:38:32,241
If I am his accomplice,

884
00:38:32,721 --> 00:38:33,321
then I am

885
00:38:33,321 --> 00:38:34,122
stuck here.

886
00:38:34,122 --> 00:38:35,161
Please

887
00:38:35,281 --> 00:38:36,721
find evidence to convict me.

888
00:38:38,042 --> 00:38:39,522
The incident taught me that

889
00:38:39,882 --> 00:38:40,761
we were not only

890
00:38:40,882 --> 00:38:42,042
against Demon God Association

891
00:38:42,281 --> 00:38:43,882
but also the spies among us.

892
00:38:44,761 --> 00:38:46,482
Along the way, I was thinking

893
00:38:46,602 --> 00:38:48,281
why you transferred Ge Bin at risk.

894
00:38:48,922 --> 00:38:50,641
You wanted to lure the demons,

895
00:38:50,801 --> 00:38:52,562
and more importantly, the spies.

896
00:38:53,042 --> 00:38:55,361
(What a smart kid.)

897
00:39:00,082 --> 00:39:02,161
What do you think about it?

898
00:39:02,281 --> 00:39:03,841
I think the spies

899
00:39:03,962 --> 00:39:05,681
are more threatening than the demons.

900
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:06,761
We must find them soon,

901
00:39:06,761 --> 00:39:08,241
or things will go really bad.

902
00:39:09,402 --> 00:39:10,482
Instead of wasting your time

903
00:39:10,482 --> 00:39:11,361
on suspecting me,

904
00:39:11,442 --> 00:39:12,482
you should try

905
00:39:12,602 --> 00:39:13,801
to find the spies.

906
00:39:13,922 --> 00:39:15,361
So arrogant.

907
00:39:15,562 --> 00:39:16,241
Why don't you

908
00:39:16,241 --> 00:39:17,042
find them?

909
00:39:17,042 --> 00:39:18,641
Does it prove my innocence

910
00:39:18,761 --> 00:39:20,201
if I find the spies?

911
00:39:20,402 --> 00:39:21,602
Master, he...

912
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,241
Are you sure there are spies

913
00:39:25,361 --> 00:39:26,602
in the Water Daoist Temple?

914
00:39:27,641 --> 00:39:29,882
Master Sikong,
don't you want to catch the person

915
00:39:30,161 --> 00:39:31,922
who stole the Ocean Realm Stone?

916
00:39:33,442 --> 00:39:34,641
Let me try.

917
00:39:35,281 --> 00:39:36,082
First of all,

918
00:39:36,161 --> 00:39:37,321
I can prove my innocence.

919
00:39:37,361 --> 00:39:38,002
Secondly,

920
00:39:38,402 --> 00:39:40,241
I can help you get rid of the spies.

921
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:42,841
You think you can

922
00:39:42,841 --> 00:39:43,721
do whatever you want

923
00:39:43,841 --> 00:39:45,042
in our temple?

924
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:45,602
Master.

925
00:39:45,602 --> 00:39:46,882
This guy is up to something.

926
00:39:51,082 --> 00:39:52,482
There's something you don't know.

927
00:39:52,841 --> 00:39:53,681
When I brought

928
00:39:53,841 --> 00:39:55,321
the Ocean Realm Stone back,

929
00:39:55,442 --> 00:39:56,841
I also found a magical powder.

930
00:39:57,962 --> 00:39:59,882
If you touch the Ocean Realm Stone

931
00:40:00,002 --> 00:40:01,562
and the powder in this bottle,

932
00:40:01,681 --> 00:40:02,922
the demonic poison

933
00:40:03,122 --> 00:40:04,161
will cause ulceration

934
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:05,562
and kill you in two hours.

935
00:40:05,882 --> 00:40:07,602
Master Sikong brought me here

936
00:40:07,761 --> 00:40:08,482
to catch the thief

937
00:40:08,482 --> 00:40:09,882
who stole the realm stone.

938
00:40:10,442 --> 00:40:11,641
But don't worry.

939
00:40:12,002 --> 00:40:13,442
You'll be fine if you haven't

940
00:40:13,562 --> 00:40:14,721
done anything wrong.

941
00:40:34,482 --> 00:40:35,562
Why are you nervous?

942
00:40:35,922 --> 00:40:38,042
I-I haven't touched
the Ocean Realm Stone ever.

943
00:40:38,161 --> 00:40:39,161
I'm not scared.

944
00:40:39,482 --> 00:40:40,321
But what you said

945
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:41,161
sounded horrendous.

946
00:40:41,281 --> 00:40:42,761
It can turn into demonic poison.

947
00:40:42,761 --> 00:40:45,361
Is the powder poisonous by itself?

948
00:40:45,482 --> 00:40:47,641
Will it spread the demonic poison?

949
00:40:47,761 --> 00:40:48,562
Rest assured.

950
00:40:48,681 --> 00:40:49,922
Nothing will happen

951
00:40:50,042 --> 00:40:51,122
if you didn't do anything.

952
00:40:52,281 --> 00:40:53,082
Okay.

953
00:41:01,922 --> 00:41:03,042
(This guy has been)

954
00:41:03,042 --> 00:41:04,321
(looking disturbed.)

955
00:41:04,922 --> 00:41:06,361
(Something's off.)

956
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:10,321
Pretentious fraud.

957
00:41:12,841 --> 00:41:14,201
I bet the powder

958
00:41:14,321 --> 00:41:16,321
was specially made

959
00:41:16,442 --> 00:41:17,562
to verify

960
00:41:17,841 --> 00:41:20,361
the authenticity
of the Ocean Realm Stone.

961
00:41:20,761 --> 00:41:21,962
Come on, Senior.

962
00:41:25,161 --> 00:41:26,281
(Look at him.)

963
00:41:26,442 --> 00:41:28,002
(How can he be innocent?)

964
00:41:28,201 --> 00:41:29,562
(Let me add some spice.)

965
00:41:30,402 --> 00:41:31,122
Senior.

966
00:41:31,721 --> 00:41:32,641
Your neck.

967
00:41:35,002 --> 00:41:35,962
My neck.

968
00:41:36,801 --> 00:41:37,922
What's wrong with my neck?

969
00:41:38,641 --> 00:41:40,042
Why is my neck burning?

970
00:41:40,161 --> 00:41:41,122
Is the pus coming out?

971
00:41:42,122 --> 00:41:42,841
Master.

972
00:41:42,841 --> 00:41:44,082
Master, save me!

973
00:41:44,082 --> 00:41:44,841
- Xiuran.
- Master.

974
00:41:45,641 --> 00:41:47,042
It was you!

975
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:47,721
Confess.

976
00:41:47,721 --> 00:41:48,962
Who was behind it?

977
00:41:49,522 --> 00:41:50,962
I-I...

978
00:42:01,321 --> 00:42:02,641
Don't you want anything to say?

979
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:03,841
Do you prefer suicide?

980
00:42:04,042 --> 00:42:04,761
No.

981
00:42:06,201 --> 00:42:07,042
Muyu.

982
00:42:07,241 --> 00:42:08,201
Even you...

983
00:42:08,201 --> 00:42:09,361
Master, sorry.

984
00:42:09,602 --> 00:42:11,922
The Demon Clan
cast the Deadly Vow on him.

985
00:42:12,122 --> 00:42:13,962
He would die painfully and miserably

986
00:42:14,442 --> 00:42:16,161
if he reveals the mastermind.

987
00:42:16,321 --> 00:42:17,442
He had to commit suicide.

988
00:42:17,801 --> 00:42:18,962
I have never intended

989
00:42:18,962 --> 00:42:20,361
to steal the Ocean Realm Stone.

990
00:42:20,361 --> 00:42:22,962
Neither do I have the nerve
to work with the Demon Clan.

991
00:42:23,402 --> 00:42:24,201
It's just that

992
00:42:24,801 --> 00:42:27,002
Xiuran was like my brother.

993
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:28,602
I found out by chance

994
00:42:28,602 --> 00:42:29,922
that he was working

995
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:31,442
for them against his will.

996
00:42:31,962 --> 00:42:32,721
So,

997
00:42:32,841 --> 00:42:34,522
I had to keep it a secret.

998
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,042
I didn't tell you

999
00:42:36,161 --> 00:42:37,482
which was a huge mistake.

1000
00:42:37,482 --> 00:42:38,841
It's all my fault.

1001
00:42:38,962 --> 00:42:40,641
Please forgive me.

1002
00:42:40,962 --> 00:42:42,042
Please save me.

1003
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:43,562
Give us the antidote.

1004
00:42:43,721 --> 00:42:45,641
You want the antidote? That's easy.

1005
00:42:46,122 --> 00:42:46,681
It's just

1006
00:42:46,681 --> 00:42:47,922
some chili powder.

1007
00:42:48,321 --> 00:42:49,281
Rinse it off

1008
00:42:49,402 --> 00:42:50,841
and you'll be fine.

1009
00:42:51,361 --> 00:42:52,122
What?

1010
00:42:53,602 --> 00:42:54,201
You...

1011
00:42:54,201 --> 00:42:54,882
Someone!

1012
00:42:55,042 --> 00:42:55,681
Here.

1013
00:42:55,681 --> 00:42:56,442
Take him away.

1014
00:42:56,801 --> 00:42:58,042
Put him in Glacier Prison.

1015
00:42:58,042 --> 00:42:58,482
Yes.

1016
00:42:58,482 --> 00:42:59,201
Master.

1017
00:43:14,042 --> 00:43:15,321
It turned out that our faction

1018
00:43:15,442 --> 00:43:16,962
did have spies of the Demon Clan.

1019
00:43:17,402 --> 00:43:18,361
Senior Muyu said

1020
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:19,721
he hadn't done anything.

1021
00:43:19,882 --> 00:43:21,042
But I'm afraid

1022
00:43:21,161 --> 00:43:23,002
it's hard for people to believe in him.

1023
00:43:23,161 --> 00:43:24,361
Besides,

1024
00:43:24,482 --> 00:43:26,361
Senior Xiuran is already dead.

1025
00:43:26,761 --> 00:43:28,082
And Master has shut Muyu

1026
00:43:28,082 --> 00:43:29,161
into the Glacier Prison.

1027
00:43:29,241 --> 00:43:30,882
No one has ever

1028
00:43:31,002 --> 00:43:31,882
come out

1029
00:43:31,882 --> 00:43:33,002
of there alive.

1030
00:43:33,122 --> 00:43:34,641
He didn't necessarily want him dead.

1031
00:43:34,801 --> 00:43:35,562
But it's such

1032
00:43:35,562 --> 00:43:36,882
a humiliating incident.

1033
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,281
We need to find out

1034
00:43:38,402 --> 00:43:40,361
the real plan of the Demon Clan

1035
00:43:40,482 --> 00:43:41,602
to make conclusions.

1036
00:43:41,721 --> 00:43:43,002
We escorted Ge Bin

1037
00:43:43,122 --> 00:43:44,721
to catch someone from the Demon Clan

1038
00:43:44,922 --> 00:43:45,962
so that we figure out

1039
00:43:45,962 --> 00:43:46,841
what they were trying

1040
00:43:46,841 --> 00:43:47,962
to do by creating demons.

1041
00:43:48,402 --> 00:43:49,721
But we didn't catch anyone

1042
00:43:49,801 --> 00:43:51,161
and Senior Xiuran died.

1043
00:43:51,281 --> 00:43:52,922
We've lost all our clues again.

1044
00:43:53,002 --> 00:43:53,962
Not necessarily.

1045
00:43:56,361 --> 00:43:57,361
What brought you here?

1046
00:43:57,361 --> 00:43:58,042
Miss Yu.

1047
00:43:58,082 --> 00:43:59,201
I have an idea.

1048
00:44:00,361 --> 00:44:01,361
