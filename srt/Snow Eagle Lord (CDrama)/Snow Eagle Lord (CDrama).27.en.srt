Senior Lan.

22
00:01:58,777 --> 00:01:59,417
What's up?

23
00:01:59,736 --> 00:02:00,536
Today,

24
00:02:00,536 --> 00:02:02,137
I'm a little confused
about the mental cultivation book

25
00:02:02,137 --> 00:02:03,016
that Master Sikong asked me to read.

26
00:02:03,016 --> 00:02:03,937
Can I get some help from you?

27
00:02:03,937 --> 00:02:04,777
Let's talk about it tomorrow.

28
00:02:05,176 --> 00:02:05,777
Senior Lan.

29
00:02:06,256 --> 00:02:07,536
You always rank first,

30
00:02:07,536 --> 00:02:08,696
while I'm always the last.

31
00:02:08,856 --> 00:02:10,256
You won't just stand by
and watch, right?

32
00:02:12,017 --> 00:02:12,617
Alright.

33
00:02:13,337 --> 00:02:14,376
Then tell me.

34
00:02:14,536 --> 00:02:15,497
What don't you understand?

35
00:02:16,856 --> 00:02:17,136
Who is it?

36
00:02:17,136 --> 00:02:17,816
Well...

37
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:23,617
What happened?

38
00:02:24,376 --> 00:02:25,497
Someone broke in just now,

39
00:02:25,696 --> 00:02:26,617
but they were too fast.

40
00:02:26,617 --> 00:02:27,576
I didn't see them clearly.

41
00:02:27,976 --> 00:02:28,937
That can't be true.

42
00:02:29,096 --> 00:02:30,256
Don't be paranoid.

43
00:02:30,416 --> 00:02:31,816
No one would intrude
into the Xinhuo Palace.

44
00:02:32,376 --> 00:02:33,376
Except for the Demon Clan.

45
00:02:36,416 --> 00:02:37,017
Demon Clan.

46
00:02:37,816 --> 00:02:39,536
If it's really the Demon Clan,

47
00:02:39,696 --> 00:02:40,656
then it'll be a serious problem.

48
00:02:41,337 --> 00:02:41,777
Let's chase.

49
00:02:42,136 --> 00:02:42,656
Alright.

50
00:02:48,432 --> 00:02:54,840
(Library)

51
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:10,897
Xueying,

52
00:03:11,256 --> 00:03:12,576
I'll help you

53
00:03:12,576 --> 00:03:13,617
with anything you want to do.

54
00:03:23,457 --> 00:03:24,937
Xueying must be arriving soon.

55
00:03:25,057 --> 00:03:26,217
I need to make some preparation.

56
00:03:56,897 --> 00:03:59,017
(Can't believe the Demon Clan
has so many holy treasures.)

57
00:03:59,457 --> 00:04:01,017
(I have to find one
that makes a great sound.)

58
00:04:29,737 --> 00:04:30,657
(What's going on?)

59
00:04:31,376 --> 00:04:32,376
(These holy treasures)

60
00:04:32,376 --> 00:04:33,937
(seem to have a reaction to me.)

61
00:04:40,857 --> 00:04:41,417
This way.

62
00:04:46,857 --> 00:04:47,857
Someone broke into the chamber.

63
00:04:47,857 --> 00:04:49,016
Should we inform the Elders?

64
00:04:49,336 --> 00:04:49,937
Yes.

65
00:04:50,016 --> 00:04:50,937
Guard here.

66
00:04:51,097 --> 00:04:52,657
I'll go report to the Elders now.

67
00:05:45,057 --> 00:05:45,657
Jingqiu.

68
00:05:46,776 --> 00:05:47,456
Jingqiu.

69
00:05:57,896 --> 00:05:58,537
Jingqiu,

70
00:05:58,657 --> 00:05:59,376
what's wrong?

71
00:06:04,696 --> 00:06:05,776
(Dongbo Xueying,)

72
00:06:05,937 --> 00:06:07,417
(you grabbed the chance again.)

73
00:06:52,016 --> 00:06:52,776
Xueying,

74
00:06:52,896 --> 00:06:53,737
hold on.

75
00:06:53,737 --> 00:06:55,297
I'll bring the Elders here immediately.

76
00:07:03,256 --> 00:07:04,216
Was it you who just sent
the distress signal

77
00:07:04,216 --> 00:07:05,256
through the box?

78
00:07:05,657 --> 00:07:06,177
Yes.

79
00:07:06,297 --> 00:07:07,097
Elders,

80
00:07:07,376 --> 00:07:08,177
the Demon Clan's holy treasures sealed

81
00:07:08,177 --> 00:07:08,857
in the chamber

82
00:07:08,857 --> 00:07:09,776
have been activated.

83
00:07:10,177 --> 00:07:11,497
Xueying is struggling to resist.

84
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:12,657
Let's go in now.

85
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:25,297
(So it was my mother's storage treasure)

86
00:07:25,297 --> 00:07:26,297
(that protected us.)

87
00:07:26,896 --> 00:07:28,177
You must keep it well.

88
00:07:28,417 --> 00:07:29,776
When you meet someone in the future,

89
00:07:30,016 --> 00:07:30,696
it may unleash

90
00:07:30,696 --> 00:07:32,097
incredible power.

91
00:07:38,977 --> 00:07:39,537
Jingqiu.

92
00:07:41,336 --> 00:07:42,177
Xueying.

93
00:07:42,737 --> 00:07:44,376
My head is about to explode.

94
00:07:44,657 --> 00:07:45,696
Why is this happening?

95
00:07:48,256 --> 00:07:49,537
Is my time nearly up?

96
00:07:49,696 --> 00:07:50,776
What nonsense are you talking about?

97
00:07:51,016 --> 00:07:51,816
You'll be fine.

98
00:07:54,256 --> 00:07:54,937
Elders,

99
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:55,896
look.

100
00:08:00,297 --> 00:08:01,136
Set up a formation first

101
00:08:01,576 --> 00:08:03,016
to stabilize these treasures.

102
00:08:03,537 --> 00:08:03,977
Alright.

103
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:20,097
Lan Sha,

104
00:08:20,497 --> 00:08:21,336
leave this side to me.

105
00:08:21,336 --> 00:08:21,896
Go and help over there.

106
00:08:21,896 --> 00:08:22,256
Alright.

107
00:08:24,336 --> 00:08:25,696
(Even God helps me.)

108
00:08:36,616 --> 00:08:37,616
So much demonic energy.

109
00:08:37,657 --> 00:08:39,096
Where did these Demon Owls come from?

110
00:08:39,096 --> 00:08:39,696
Aren't there only holy treasures

111
00:08:39,696 --> 00:08:41,017
inside the chamber?

112
00:08:41,377 --> 00:08:42,137
Stop asking.

113
00:08:42,137 --> 00:08:43,496
Just don't let them escape.

114
00:08:48,137 --> 00:08:48,897
(It's strange.)

115
00:08:49,736 --> 00:08:50,496
(Why don't the Demon Owls)

116
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:51,736
(attack him?)

117
00:08:52,177 --> 00:08:53,216
(Is he...?)

118
00:08:55,496 --> 00:08:57,696
I'm longing to go back
to the Black Wind Cliff

119
00:08:58,096 --> 00:08:59,537
where there are
no Transcendent cultivators,

120
00:09:00,257 --> 00:09:01,377
no demons,

121
00:09:01,777 --> 00:09:03,017
and no responsibility for us

122
00:09:04,216 --> 00:09:05,336
but the two of us.

123
00:09:06,777 --> 00:09:07,377
Alright.

124
00:09:07,777 --> 00:09:08,657
I promise you.

125
00:09:09,177 --> 00:09:09,856
Once we get out,

126
00:09:09,856 --> 00:09:11,137
I'll take you to the Black Wind Cliff.

127
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,017
Is that okay?

128
00:09:14,257 --> 00:09:15,017
Jingqiu,

129
00:09:16,297 --> 00:09:16,937
Jingqiu.

130
00:09:24,336 --> 00:09:25,657
Something is about to awaken.

131
00:09:49,496 --> 00:09:50,657
Seal it.

132
00:10:09,696 --> 00:10:10,216
Jingqiu,

133
00:10:10,496 --> 00:10:11,096
Jingqiu.

134
00:10:12,137 --> 00:10:12,657
Stop.

135
00:10:12,897 --> 00:10:14,336
If you want her to live, let go.

136
00:10:28,736 --> 00:10:29,576
(It's strange.)

137
00:10:30,336 --> 00:10:31,657
(All six Elders are here.)

138
00:10:32,216 --> 00:10:33,017
(So who lost)

139
00:10:33,017 --> 00:10:34,257
(that message box?)

140
00:10:40,696 --> 00:10:41,377
Jingqiu,

141
00:10:41,616 --> 00:10:42,216
how do you feel?

142
00:10:42,496 --> 00:10:43,537
My Young Master,

143
00:10:43,897 --> 00:10:45,537
no one can hurt you anymore.

144
00:10:49,576 --> 00:10:50,736
Are you a human or a demon?

145
00:10:51,177 --> 00:10:52,336
In this chamber

146
00:10:52,336 --> 00:10:53,537
are the cultivation tools left

147
00:10:53,537 --> 00:10:55,057
by the Demon Clan

148
00:10:55,057 --> 00:10:56,336
on the Dragon Mountain Continent
after the great war.

149
00:10:56,816 --> 00:10:58,377
Your appearance is so strange.

150
00:10:58,856 --> 00:11:00,096
Who are you?

151
00:11:00,377 --> 00:11:01,736
Master He is right.

152
00:11:02,177 --> 00:11:03,856
If this woman is related
to the Demon Clan,

153
00:11:04,177 --> 00:11:05,057
then Jingqiu...

154
00:11:06,976 --> 00:11:07,816
I am

155
00:11:07,816 --> 00:11:09,297
Xi Yun of the Temple of the Earth God.

156
00:11:09,816 --> 00:11:11,137
May I ask who you are?

157
00:11:11,377 --> 00:11:13,057
I am not a holy treasure
of the Demon Clan.

158
00:11:13,616 --> 00:11:14,616
I am Xue Ruoshuang, the Spirit Hairpin

159
00:11:14,616 --> 00:11:15,897
of Monarch Moxue,

160
00:11:15,897 --> 00:11:17,616
who descended to assist you in fighting

161
00:11:17,897 --> 00:11:18,976
against the Demon Clan back then.

162
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,616
Monarch Moxue?

163
00:11:25,937 --> 00:11:27,496
Just now, you called Jingqiu...

164
00:11:27,496 --> 00:11:28,257
Right.

165
00:11:29,257 --> 00:11:31,017
Jingqiu is our young master

166
00:11:31,976 --> 00:11:33,537
and Monarch Moxue's daughter.

167
00:11:42,177 --> 00:11:44,216
(Jingqiu is the princess of Moxue Empire?)

168
00:12:35,017 --> 00:12:35,696
Mrs. Xue,

169
00:12:35,897 --> 00:12:36,816
how is Jingqiu doing?

170
00:12:36,937 --> 00:12:38,137
The young master is fine.

171
00:12:38,137 --> 00:12:39,257
She just needs to rest for a while.

172
00:12:41,017 --> 00:12:42,616
Back then, Monarch Moxue and his wife

173
00:12:42,616 --> 00:12:44,297
couldn't bear to see

174
00:12:44,297 --> 00:12:45,696
the people of your empire suffering,

175
00:12:45,937 --> 00:12:47,816
so they descended into this world
and joined forces with you

176
00:12:47,816 --> 00:12:48,897
to fight against the Demon Clan.

177
00:13:01,377 --> 00:13:02,377
Father.

178
00:13:02,456 --> 00:13:03,657
Mother.

179
00:13:04,816 --> 00:13:06,456
Father.

180
00:13:25,017 --> 00:13:25,576
My lady.

181
00:13:26,777 --> 00:13:27,456
My lady.

182
00:13:27,937 --> 00:13:28,777
My lady.

183
00:13:39,496 --> 00:13:41,377
(Back then, I was escorting
the young master back,)

184
00:13:41,576 --> 00:13:42,496
(Water Daoist Temple)
(but the demons)

185
00:13:42,496 --> 00:13:43,897
(chased us all the way.)

186
00:13:44,377 --> 00:13:46,057
(In order to ensure
the young master's safety,)

187
00:13:46,297 --> 00:13:47,377
(I had to hide her first)

188
00:13:47,377 --> 00:13:48,736
(at the entrance
of the Water Daoist Temple.)

189
00:13:51,736 --> 00:13:52,496
Young Master,

190
00:13:53,096 --> 00:13:54,017
I'm afraid

191
00:13:54,017 --> 00:13:55,897
I can't take you back
to the Heavenly Realm temporarily.

192
00:13:59,576 --> 00:14:01,017
I sealed your divine bloodline

193
00:14:01,976 --> 00:14:03,537
and erased your memory.

194
00:14:04,257 --> 00:14:05,937
The current danger is more important.

195
00:14:07,816 --> 00:14:08,937
When everything is safe,

196
00:14:11,096 --> 00:14:12,496
I will come to find you.

197
00:14:44,537 --> 00:14:45,937
(The Demon Clan chased me all the way.)

198
00:14:45,976 --> 00:14:47,336
(I was seriously injured)

199
00:14:47,777 --> 00:14:49,017
(and returned to my original form.)

200
00:14:50,057 --> 00:14:51,456
Later, I was mistaken
by Transcendent cultivators

201
00:14:51,456 --> 00:14:52,897
for a tool of the Demon Clan

202
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:54,496
and was taken
into the Xinhuo Palace together.

203
00:14:54,816 --> 00:14:56,137
So all these years,

204
00:14:56,297 --> 00:14:57,216
you've been

205
00:14:57,216 --> 00:14:58,496
in the chamber of the palace?

206
00:14:58,696 --> 00:14:59,377
Exactly.

207
00:15:00,417 --> 00:15:01,537
Come on.

208
00:15:01,537 --> 00:15:02,616
Nobody's buying it.

209
00:15:03,177 --> 00:15:03,736
Since you said

210
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,537
you are the Spirit Hairpin
of Monarch Moxue,

211
00:15:05,696 --> 00:15:07,537
how was it possible
that this small chamber

212
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:09,017
could trap you?

213
00:15:09,417 --> 00:15:11,057
Firstly, I was seriously injured,

214
00:15:11,057 --> 00:15:12,937
unable to break free
from this formation.

215
00:15:13,336 --> 00:15:14,177
Secondly,

216
00:15:14,177 --> 00:15:15,937
I thought that forcibly breaking it

217
00:15:16,177 --> 00:15:17,976
would awaken
the Demon Clan's holy treasures

218
00:15:18,096 --> 00:15:19,537
and cause unnecessary trouble.

219
00:15:19,777 --> 00:15:20,456
Of course,

220
00:15:20,657 --> 00:15:21,216
the main reason

221
00:15:21,216 --> 00:15:22,417
was that the young master lived well

222
00:15:22,417 --> 00:15:23,576
in the Water Daoist Temple.

223
00:15:23,897 --> 00:15:25,576
Despite constant small dangers,

224
00:15:25,576 --> 00:15:27,257
they all turned
into blessings in disguise.

225
00:15:27,417 --> 00:15:28,976
I ought to thank Master Sikong

226
00:15:28,976 --> 00:15:30,177
for all these years of care.

227
00:15:30,216 --> 00:15:31,216
Since we

228
00:15:31,216 --> 00:15:32,537
adopted Jingqiu,

229
00:15:32,537 --> 00:15:33,616
taking good care of her

230
00:15:33,616 --> 00:15:35,657
is our responsibility.

231
00:15:35,897 --> 00:15:36,816
All these years,

232
00:15:36,816 --> 00:15:38,417
you've been locked in this chamber.

233
00:15:38,417 --> 00:15:39,816
How can you make sure

234
00:15:39,816 --> 00:15:41,257
Jingqiu is that little girl?

235
00:15:41,456 --> 00:15:42,976
I am the best proof.

236
00:15:43,336 --> 00:15:44,177
I can sense

237
00:15:44,177 --> 00:15:45,377
if my young master
is safe or in danger.

238
00:15:45,576 --> 00:15:47,417
Today, she was in danger just now,

239
00:15:47,417 --> 00:15:48,937
so I was awakened again.

240
00:15:49,417 --> 00:15:50,816
I've said everything I need to say.

241
00:15:51,576 --> 00:15:52,657
Master Sikong,

242
00:15:52,816 --> 00:15:54,377
my young master
has a special constitution,

243
00:15:54,377 --> 00:15:56,057
and she is still very weak.

244
00:15:56,137 --> 00:15:57,736
I wonder if you could grant me a favor

245
00:15:57,736 --> 00:15:58,897
and let me stay in this palace

246
00:15:58,897 --> 00:15:59,897
for a few days

247
00:15:59,897 --> 00:16:01,057
to take care of her.

248
00:16:01,057 --> 00:16:02,177
You don't have to say that.

249
00:16:02,177 --> 00:16:03,456
We would arrange it anyway.

250
00:16:04,216 --> 00:16:05,417
You can stay

251
00:16:05,417 --> 00:16:06,736
in the Qiuxuan Court

252
00:16:06,736 --> 00:16:07,937
as long as you want.

253
00:16:08,177 --> 00:16:09,856
Thank you.

254
00:16:18,988 --> 00:16:20,577
(Qinyi Pavilion)

255
00:16:39,216 --> 00:16:40,137
What's going on?

256
00:16:42,096 --> 00:16:43,377
The message box

257
00:16:43,856 --> 00:16:45,017
was stolen.

258
00:16:56,856 --> 00:16:57,657
Shi.

259
00:17:00,137 --> 00:17:01,257
Why are you here?

260
00:17:01,377 --> 00:17:02,096
Uncle Zong,

261
00:17:02,816 --> 00:17:04,016
it's been a long time
since we came back last time,

262
00:17:04,296 --> 00:17:05,536
and Ji Rong and I missed you,

263
00:17:05,577 --> 00:17:06,736
so we came to see you.

264
00:17:06,736 --> 00:17:07,577
Uncle Zong,

265
00:17:07,817 --> 00:17:09,137
I know Uncle Tong San's death

266
00:17:09,137 --> 00:17:10,377
is hard for you to accept.

267
00:17:10,657 --> 00:17:12,337
You should take good care of yourself.

268
00:17:12,496 --> 00:17:13,137
Thank you.

269
00:17:15,377 --> 00:17:16,016
Uncle Zong,

270
00:17:16,296 --> 00:17:17,577
what are we having for dinner tonight?

271
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:19,016
I'm starving.

272
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:20,137
After we have dinner,

273
00:17:20,256 --> 00:17:20,817
let's go together

274
00:17:20,817 --> 00:17:22,056
to pay respects to Uncle Tong San.

275
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,337
He's gone now,

276
00:17:24,817 --> 00:17:26,097
and I'm really not used to it.

277
00:17:26,536 --> 00:17:27,337
I miss him a lot.

278
00:17:29,256 --> 00:17:30,016
It's all right.

279
00:17:30,296 --> 00:17:31,216
He is watching over

280
00:17:31,216 --> 00:17:32,056
both of you from heaven.

281
00:17:32,296 --> 00:17:33,536
Let's go. I'll grill some meat for you.

282
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:42,437
(Xueying Territory)

283
00:17:54,857 --> 00:17:55,857
(Setting up demonic devices)

284
00:17:55,897 --> 00:17:57,417
(in these three locations)

285
00:17:57,736 --> 00:17:59,016
(must be able to demonize)

286
00:17:59,016 --> 00:18:00,377
(the maximum number of people
in the Xueying Territory.)

287
00:18:01,417 --> 00:18:02,696
(This time,)

288
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,536
(I may not be able to stay long here.)

289
00:18:05,016 --> 00:18:05,937
(I have to complete)

290
00:18:05,937 --> 00:18:07,216
(my mission soon.)

291
00:18:12,337 --> 00:18:13,337
Miss Ji Rong.

292
00:18:14,817 --> 00:18:15,817
Uncle Zong Ling.

293
00:18:16,137 --> 00:18:16,736
What are you doing here

294
00:18:16,736 --> 00:18:17,617
so late?

295
00:18:18,256 --> 00:18:20,177
I have been away from here for so long

296
00:18:20,337 --> 00:18:21,976
that I have some trouble
sleeping here now.

297
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:23,377
So I'm here to enjoy the night view.

298
00:18:24,776 --> 00:18:25,857
Do you need to come all the way

299
00:18:25,857 --> 00:18:27,817
to the top of such a high city wall

300
00:18:27,817 --> 00:18:28,617
to do it?

301
00:18:29,337 --> 00:18:31,056
It was too stuffy in the room,

302
00:18:31,056 --> 00:18:32,456
so I came out for some fresh air.

303
00:18:34,456 --> 00:18:36,056
Uncle Zong Ling, I'm going back.

304
00:18:36,097 --> 00:18:37,377
You should rest early.

305
00:18:58,857 --> 00:19:00,056
Mrs. Xue,

306
00:19:01,256 --> 00:19:02,857
why are you sighing?

307
00:19:03,337 --> 00:19:04,736
Young Master, you're awake.

308
00:19:10,776 --> 00:19:11,937
You still remember

309
00:19:12,137 --> 00:19:13,256
calling me Mrs. Xue,

310
00:19:13,296 --> 00:19:14,577
just like when you were little.

311
00:19:15,256 --> 00:19:16,137
How do you feel?

312
00:19:16,216 --> 00:19:17,736
Is there any discomfort?

313
00:19:17,736 --> 00:19:18,897
Is your head still hurting?

314
00:19:19,256 --> 00:19:20,377
Mrs. Xue,

315
00:19:20,456 --> 00:19:22,137
you're still the same,

316
00:19:22,256 --> 00:19:23,496
still nagging

317
00:19:23,496 --> 00:19:24,536
like before.

318
00:19:24,897 --> 00:19:26,016
Old habits die hard.

319
00:19:26,016 --> 00:19:27,097
It's hard to break.

320
00:19:29,016 --> 00:19:30,296
You remember

321
00:19:30,857 --> 00:19:32,097
everything?

322
00:19:33,617 --> 00:19:35,577
I remember a lot of things.

323
00:19:36,377 --> 00:19:37,296
But

324
00:19:37,536 --> 00:19:39,177
some of my memories

325
00:19:39,177 --> 00:19:40,736
are still hazy.

326
00:19:41,496 --> 00:19:42,536
No rush.

327
00:19:43,296 --> 00:19:44,817
It means your divine bloodline

328
00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:45,976
is recovering

329
00:19:46,417 --> 00:19:48,296
and that the power you had
as a goddess is slowly coming back.

330
00:19:48,937 --> 00:19:50,337
Can it make me able

331
00:19:50,577 --> 00:19:51,976
to defeat a Transcendent cultivator?

332
00:19:52,056 --> 00:19:53,097
It's more than that.

333
00:19:53,097 --> 00:19:54,137
No one in the Dragon Mountain Empire

334
00:19:54,137 --> 00:19:55,456
will be a match for you.

335
00:19:57,097 --> 00:19:58,577
But...

336
00:19:59,577 --> 00:20:00,657
But what?

337
00:20:01,776 --> 00:20:03,857
Since your divine consciousness
has recovered,

338
00:20:04,696 --> 00:20:05,456
it's nearly time for us

339
00:20:05,456 --> 00:20:06,657
to go back.

340
00:20:08,016 --> 00:20:08,897
Going back?

341
00:20:11,056 --> 00:20:12,536
I don't want to leave here.

342
00:20:12,776 --> 00:20:14,377
I haven't found the Demon God yet,

343
00:20:14,577 --> 00:20:16,097
and Xueying hasn't...

344
00:20:16,976 --> 00:20:17,976
Young Master,

345
00:20:18,776 --> 00:20:20,817
you're the daughter of Monarch Moxue.

346
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:22,657
The people of Moxue Empire need you.

347
00:20:23,216 --> 00:20:24,657
The people and things here

348
00:20:25,377 --> 00:20:26,016
are not in the same world

349
00:20:26,016 --> 00:20:27,337
as you.

350
00:20:28,417 --> 00:20:29,496
Treat it like a dream.

351
00:20:29,696 --> 00:20:30,617
Now you wake up.

352
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:31,897
Just forget it.

353
00:20:32,377 --> 00:20:34,016
If only

354
00:20:35,296 --> 00:20:36,097
it were a dream.

355
00:20:40,256 --> 00:20:40,817
Master,

356
00:20:41,897 --> 00:20:43,256
the chamber has been cleaned up.

357
00:20:43,417 --> 00:20:44,657
Except for some damaged ones,

358
00:20:44,817 --> 00:20:46,696
none of the demons' holy treasures
are missing.

359
00:20:48,496 --> 00:20:50,256
Is there anything suspicious?

360
00:20:52,937 --> 00:20:53,817
Come in.

361
00:20:55,417 --> 00:20:56,177
Master.

362
00:20:57,296 --> 00:20:58,097
Senior Lan.

363
00:20:58,657 --> 00:20:59,897
I'm really sorry

364
00:21:00,016 --> 00:21:01,256
about what happened that day.

365
00:21:01,577 --> 00:21:02,496
It was my fault.

366
00:21:02,857 --> 00:21:04,016
We are schoolmates.

367
00:21:04,256 --> 00:21:04,857
Xueying,

368
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:05,897
you're being too serious.

369
00:21:06,097 --> 00:21:07,296
As you said, we are schoolmates,

370
00:21:07,536 --> 00:21:09,016
and that's even worse.

371
00:21:09,177 --> 00:21:10,177
I shouldn't have put you

372
00:21:10,177 --> 00:21:11,137
in harm's way.

373
00:21:11,817 --> 00:21:13,056
Please punish me, senior.

374
00:21:15,056 --> 00:21:15,937
If that's what you want,

375
00:21:16,496 --> 00:21:17,216
keep copying

376
00:21:17,216 --> 00:21:18,377
books

377
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:19,216
in the library.

378
00:21:21,016 --> 00:21:21,937
Alright,

379
00:21:23,296 --> 00:21:24,177
let's put an end

380
00:21:24,296 --> 00:21:25,536
to this matter.

381
00:21:27,736 --> 00:21:28,496
Xueying,

382
00:21:28,897 --> 00:21:30,617
there's one thing
I still don't understand.

383
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,016
Where did that demonic smoke

384
00:21:32,177 --> 00:21:33,577
come from?

385
00:21:33,857 --> 00:21:35,337
Jingqiu told me at the time

386
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:36,657
that besides her,

387
00:21:36,696 --> 00:21:37,817
there was another person present.

388
00:21:38,177 --> 00:21:38,577
However,

389
00:21:38,577 --> 00:21:39,897
she didn't get
a clear look at their face.

390
00:21:39,897 --> 00:21:40,776
Another person.

391
00:21:41,056 --> 00:21:41,577
Yes.

392
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:54,617
You two came together.

393
00:21:54,937 --> 00:21:56,216
What brings you here?

394
00:21:56,337 --> 00:21:58,216
We were too abrupt yesterday,

395
00:21:58,696 --> 00:21:59,976
so we specially came

396
00:22:00,016 --> 00:22:01,296
to apologize to you.

397
00:22:10,577 --> 00:22:12,256
Since you want me to have it,

398
00:22:13,097 --> 00:22:14,256
I'll accept it.

399
00:22:26,337 --> 00:22:27,976
This is the gift you gave me?

400
00:22:29,097 --> 00:22:29,976
It's a misunderstanding.

401
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:31,776
It's not a misunderstanding at all.

402
00:22:32,577 --> 00:22:33,216
You just

403
00:22:33,216 --> 00:22:34,496
wanted to test me.

404
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,097
I tested you,

405
00:22:36,256 --> 00:22:37,456
so what can you do about it?

406
00:22:37,857 --> 00:22:38,776
The Demon Chasing Talisman

407
00:22:38,776 --> 00:22:39,496
is used to

408
00:22:39,496 --> 00:22:40,417
fight against the Demon Clan.

409
00:22:40,496 --> 00:22:41,976
Since everything you said is true,

410
00:22:41,976 --> 00:22:43,296
there's nothing to be afraid of.

411
00:22:43,337 --> 00:22:44,857
This is way too much.

412
00:22:45,177 --> 00:22:46,097
Mrs. Xue,

413
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:48,417
let it go.

414
00:22:49,897 --> 00:22:50,937
I believe the two Elders

415
00:22:50,937 --> 00:22:51,897
didn't mean any harm.

416
00:22:53,056 --> 00:22:54,577
As the young master of Moxue Empire,

417
00:22:54,577 --> 00:22:55,577
you understand the bigger picture.

418
00:22:56,097 --> 00:22:56,817
But

419
00:22:57,496 --> 00:22:58,496
Elders,

420
00:22:59,137 --> 00:23:00,496
you have tested her.

421
00:23:00,937 --> 00:23:02,817
If something like this happens again,

422
00:23:03,137 --> 00:23:04,857
I'm afraid it won't be acceptable.

423
00:23:05,857 --> 00:23:06,817
It will never happen

424
00:23:06,817 --> 00:23:07,976
again.

425
00:23:11,097 --> 00:23:12,256
I guarantee it.

426
00:23:12,776 --> 00:23:13,577
Lady,

427
00:23:13,577 --> 00:23:14,736
please don't be angry.

428
00:23:15,496 --> 00:23:16,937
Ye Mei has a quick temper,

429
00:23:17,296 --> 00:23:18,937
but she's very kind-hearted deep down.

430
00:23:19,056 --> 00:23:20,256
After spending more time together,

431
00:23:20,256 --> 00:23:21,577
you'll naturally know.

432
00:23:21,577 --> 00:23:23,216
I don't need to get along with her.

433
00:23:23,496 --> 00:23:24,696
Once I find

434
00:23:24,696 --> 00:23:26,296
the bodies of our monarch
and his wife in this world,

435
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:27,097
I'll go back to Moxue Empire

436
00:23:27,097 --> 00:23:28,417
with my young master.

437
00:23:28,536 --> 00:23:29,377
Going back?

438
00:23:30,097 --> 00:23:31,577
With the Demon Clan invading,

439
00:23:31,696 --> 00:23:32,817
don't you plan to

440
00:23:32,976 --> 00:23:34,216
fight them together

441
00:23:34,216 --> 00:23:35,256
with us?

442
00:23:35,417 --> 00:23:36,216
That is

443
00:23:36,216 --> 00:23:37,736
your business.

444
00:23:38,256 --> 00:23:39,617
What does it have to do with us?

445
00:23:40,137 --> 00:23:41,456
Last time, to help you,

446
00:23:41,456 --> 00:23:42,296
our monarch and his wife

447
00:23:42,296 --> 00:23:43,296
sacrificed themselves.

448
00:23:43,617 --> 00:23:44,657
If anything happens

449
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:45,857
to our young master this time,

450
00:23:46,456 --> 00:23:48,137
what will happen to our people?

451
00:23:50,817 --> 00:23:51,817
Elders,

452
00:23:52,536 --> 00:23:53,857
I am not talented enough.

453
00:23:54,696 --> 00:23:56,776
Although my memories
are gradually coming back,

454
00:23:56,897 --> 00:23:57,976
I still haven't broken through

455
00:23:57,976 --> 00:23:59,857
to the Transcendent Realm.

456
00:24:00,216 --> 00:24:01,496
There are some things

457
00:24:01,857 --> 00:24:03,857
that I am truly powerless to do.

458
00:24:04,216 --> 00:24:05,617
I told you.

459
00:24:05,617 --> 00:24:06,857
Don't waste your effort.

460
00:24:07,177 --> 00:24:08,417
All these years,

461
00:24:08,417 --> 00:24:09,417
have any Gods

462
00:24:09,417 --> 00:24:10,937
cared about our mortal affairs?

463
00:24:26,377 --> 00:24:27,216
Jingqiu,

464
00:24:28,256 --> 00:24:30,736
I will have some people
look for the bodies

465
00:24:30,736 --> 00:24:32,337
of Monarch Moxue and his wife.

466
00:24:32,417 --> 00:24:33,536
Whether to stay or go,

467
00:24:33,657 --> 00:24:35,256
I hope you think it over.

468
00:24:38,617 --> 00:24:40,536
You don't want
to disappoint Xueying, do you?

469
00:24:58,617 --> 00:24:59,296
Young Master,

470
00:25:00,056 --> 00:25:01,976
look at those selfish people.

471
00:25:02,256 --> 00:25:03,137
What does their business

472
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:04,377
have to do with us?

473
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:05,577
This is the Dragon Mountain Empire,

474
00:25:05,577 --> 00:25:06,696
their territory.

475
00:25:06,976 --> 00:25:08,657
Let's pack up our things
as soon as possible

476
00:25:08,976 --> 00:25:10,417
and leave this place of trouble.

477
00:25:20,337 --> 00:25:21,216
Mrs. Xue.

478
00:25:22,657 --> 00:25:23,577
Where are you going?

479
00:25:24,137 --> 00:25:25,617
Of course, I'm going to see Jingqiu.

480
00:25:25,617 --> 00:25:26,736
The young master has gone to bed.

481
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:27,937
You can come another day.

482
00:25:29,337 --> 00:25:31,016
But the lights are still on.

483
00:25:37,056 --> 00:25:38,536
I'll come again next time.

484
00:25:51,496 --> 00:25:53,056
This Snowflake Mark

485
00:25:53,377 --> 00:25:54,897
is getting more and more noticeable.

486
00:25:55,897 --> 00:25:56,937
What's the reason?

487
00:26:02,097 --> 00:26:03,056
Xueying,

488
00:26:03,177 --> 00:26:03,937
why do you...?

489
00:26:04,857 --> 00:26:05,696
Mrs. Xue

490
00:26:05,696 --> 00:26:06,536
is guarding the door,

491
00:26:06,617 --> 00:26:08,097
so I had no choice
but to climb through the window.

492
00:26:09,256 --> 00:26:10,976
Who would have thought Dongbo Xueying,

493
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:12,016
the famous Transcendent Knight,

494
00:26:12,016 --> 00:26:13,137
would actually resort
to climbing windows?

495
00:26:13,296 --> 00:26:14,617
That's not fitting for a gentleman.

496
00:26:15,137 --> 00:26:16,377
You're making fun of me?

497
00:26:16,377 --> 00:26:17,137
I shouldn't have brought you

498
00:26:17,137 --> 00:26:18,256
delicious pear flower cake.

499
00:26:26,137 --> 00:26:26,657
Oh, right.

500
00:26:27,536 --> 00:26:28,736
Are you feeling better?

501
00:26:29,296 --> 00:26:30,296
Last time,

502
00:26:30,296 --> 00:26:31,456
I was thoughtless

503
00:26:31,496 --> 00:26:32,256
and got you involved.

504
00:26:32,577 --> 00:26:33,496
Xueying,

505
00:26:33,696 --> 00:26:34,496
I helped you

506
00:26:34,496 --> 00:26:35,976
out of my own will.

507
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:37,577
But how's the thing?

508
00:26:37,577 --> 00:26:38,817
We've done so much.

509
00:26:38,817 --> 00:26:40,016
Did you find anything?

510
00:26:41,696 --> 00:26:42,937
That day, not long after Senior Lan

511
00:26:43,137 --> 00:26:44,417
sent out the signal,

512
00:26:44,776 --> 00:26:45,417
all the Elders

513
00:26:45,417 --> 00:26:46,657
arrived almost at the same time.

514
00:26:47,417 --> 00:26:48,536
It's impossible to tell

515
00:26:48,536 --> 00:26:49,696
who lost the box.

516
00:26:50,456 --> 00:26:51,377
I see.

517
00:26:52,137 --> 00:26:52,976
That's all right.

518
00:26:53,496 --> 00:26:54,577
Then let's try

519
00:26:54,577 --> 00:26:56,177
another way.

520
00:26:56,776 --> 00:26:57,776
There's no more way.

521
00:26:58,016 --> 00:26:59,377
We gave ourselves away,

522
00:26:59,577 --> 00:27:00,817
and that person
took advantage of my absence

523
00:27:01,016 --> 00:27:02,056
to steal the box.

524
00:27:02,456 --> 00:27:03,456
It's stolen?

525
00:27:05,536 --> 00:27:06,456
It seems

526
00:27:07,137 --> 00:27:08,337
the person is more cunning

527
00:27:08,337 --> 00:27:09,216
than we imagined.

528
00:27:11,216 --> 00:27:13,177
This time, I lost not only my woman

529
00:27:13,337 --> 00:27:14,296
but the box.

530
00:27:16,216 --> 00:27:18,337
Who's your woman?

531
00:27:24,016 --> 00:27:26,016
You're the daughter of Monarch Moxue.

532
00:27:26,256 --> 00:27:28,137
The people of Moxue Empire need you.

533
00:27:28,617 --> 00:27:30,097
The people and things here

534
00:27:30,657 --> 00:27:31,377
are not in the same world

535
00:27:31,377 --> 00:27:32,817
as you.

536
00:27:37,097 --> 00:27:37,857
What's wrong?

537
00:27:38,937 --> 00:27:39,857
Xueying,

538
00:27:40,937 --> 00:27:41,776
I have something to tell you.

539
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:42,577
Young Master,

540
00:27:42,857 --> 00:27:43,857
it's time to take your medicine.

541
00:27:45,016 --> 00:27:47,137
Mrs. Xue, wait a moment.

542
00:27:47,857 --> 00:27:48,456
Leave now.

543
00:27:48,857 --> 00:27:49,897
I'll come again tomorrow.

544
00:28:00,577 --> 00:28:02,377
Young Master, it's time to take your medicine.

545
00:28:09,617 --> 00:28:10,817
I had a craving,

546
00:28:10,937 --> 00:28:12,696
so I asked someone to buy me some.

547
00:28:12,976 --> 00:28:14,976
It may be hard to give up
a habit in a short time.

548
00:28:15,456 --> 00:28:16,657
But don't have too much of it.

549
00:28:16,657 --> 00:28:17,776
It's hard to digest.

550
00:28:18,897 --> 00:28:19,897
I got it.

551
00:28:26,536 --> 00:28:27,417
Young Master,

552
00:28:28,657 --> 00:28:29,897
people always think that holding on

553
00:28:29,897 --> 00:28:31,056
will make them stronger.

554
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:33,137
But sometimes,

555
00:28:33,137 --> 00:28:34,776
only by giving up can we gain.

556
00:28:46,056 --> 00:28:47,776
Goddess?

557
00:28:47,937 --> 00:28:48,736
Master,

558
00:28:48,897 --> 00:28:50,417
I have confirmed it.

559
00:28:50,577 --> 00:28:51,736
Yu Jingqiu is indeed

560
00:28:51,736 --> 00:28:53,056
the daughter of Monarch Moxue.

561
00:28:54,696 --> 00:28:55,496
Back then,

562
00:28:55,496 --> 00:28:56,937
Monarch Moxue and his wife

563
00:28:56,937 --> 00:28:58,296
fought a deadly battle with me.

564
00:28:58,377 --> 00:28:59,456
They must have never thought

565
00:28:59,456 --> 00:29:01,337
they'd be separated
from their daughter by death.

566
00:29:01,577 --> 00:29:02,897
Retribution.

567
00:29:02,897 --> 00:29:03,657
Master,

568
00:29:04,736 --> 00:29:05,897
in my opinion,

569
00:29:06,696 --> 00:29:07,496
why not just

570
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,177
take Yu Jingqiu...?

571
00:29:09,177 --> 00:29:09,857
That's improper.

572
00:29:11,736 --> 00:29:13,216
Have you forgotten, High Priest?

573
00:29:13,296 --> 00:29:15,256
Back then, so many of our fellows

574
00:29:15,536 --> 00:29:16,377
died at the hands

575
00:29:16,377 --> 00:29:18,256
of that couple.

576
00:29:18,577 --> 00:29:20,016
She's going to pay for it,

577
00:29:20,177 --> 00:29:21,536
whether she likes it or not.

578
00:29:21,617 --> 00:29:22,456
Ao Lan,

579
00:29:22,696 --> 00:29:25,016
you need to change your reckless ways.

580
00:29:25,417 --> 00:29:26,577
So you mean...

581
00:29:26,776 --> 00:29:29,256
We already got the bronze coffin,

582
00:29:29,256 --> 00:29:32,016
but unsealing it is not easy.

583
00:29:32,137 --> 00:29:32,937
Back then,

584
00:29:32,937 --> 00:29:35,177
the six Elders set up
a formation together.

585
00:29:35,177 --> 00:29:37,137
Now, if we want to break it,

586
00:29:37,137 --> 00:29:38,137
we must eliminate

587
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:39,696
them all first.

588
00:29:40,256 --> 00:29:41,817
Then we'll kill them

589
00:29:41,817 --> 00:29:42,736
one by one.

590
00:29:43,177 --> 00:29:45,016
Are we afraid of them?

591
00:29:45,097 --> 00:29:46,817
But if they join forces,

592
00:29:46,976 --> 00:29:48,056
I'm afraid

593
00:29:48,056 --> 00:29:49,976
that we are no match
for them at present.

594
00:29:50,137 --> 00:29:52,137
Instead, it will put
the master in danger.

595
00:29:52,296 --> 00:29:54,097
You make a good point, High Priest.

596
00:29:54,377 --> 00:29:56,337
Do you have a countermeasure?

597
00:29:57,056 --> 00:29:57,857
Master,

598
00:29:58,216 --> 00:30:00,256
Yu Jingqiu is the descendant of a God.

599
00:30:00,456 --> 00:30:01,337
If one day,

600
00:30:01,337 --> 00:30:02,976
her divine power fully awakens,

601
00:30:02,976 --> 00:30:03,696
no one in the Dragon Mountain Empire

602
00:30:03,696 --> 00:30:05,177
will be her match.

603
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:07,177
If we can make her obey us by then,

604
00:30:07,337 --> 00:30:08,696
taking down the six Elders

605
00:30:08,696 --> 00:30:10,417
will be effortless.

606
00:30:10,496 --> 00:30:11,976
So what's your way

607
00:30:11,976 --> 00:30:12,937
of getting her

608
00:30:12,937 --> 00:30:13,817
controlled by us,

609
00:30:13,817 --> 00:30:14,937
High Priest?

610
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,496
Since even you could

611
00:30:16,496 --> 00:30:17,857
subdue Chi Qiubai,

612
00:30:17,857 --> 00:30:19,256
of course I can come up with a way

613
00:30:19,256 --> 00:30:20,736
to demonize Yu Jingqiu.

614
00:30:20,736 --> 00:30:21,776
Second Priest,

615
00:30:21,857 --> 00:30:23,776
on the Dragon Mountain Empire,

616
00:30:23,976 --> 00:30:26,056
you need to use your brain.

617
00:30:26,937 --> 00:30:27,937
What do you mean?

618
00:30:28,536 --> 00:30:29,456
Enough.

619
00:30:29,897 --> 00:30:30,857
High Priest,

620
00:30:31,097 --> 00:30:32,216
I'll leave Yu Jingqiu's matter

621
00:30:32,216 --> 00:30:33,496
to you.

622
00:30:33,776 --> 00:30:35,657
Don't disappoint me.

623
00:30:36,137 --> 00:30:37,776
I won't let you down.

624
00:30:38,177 --> 00:30:38,857
Master,

625
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:40,496
I have something

626
00:30:41,016 --> 00:30:42,016
to report privately.

627
00:30:42,496 --> 00:30:43,577
Is there something

628
00:30:43,577 --> 00:30:45,016
that I can't know about?

629
00:30:45,016 --> 00:30:46,337
It's an internal affair

630
00:30:46,337 --> 00:30:47,216
of our clan.

631
00:30:47,776 --> 00:30:48,976
You won't understand even if I tell you.

632
00:30:49,776 --> 00:30:51,377
Enough, High Priest.

633
00:30:51,377 --> 00:30:52,417
Be quiet.

634
00:30:55,137 --> 00:30:55,817
Master,

635
00:30:56,817 --> 00:30:57,417
do you

636
00:30:57,417 --> 00:30:58,937
trust the High Priest that much?

637
00:30:59,016 --> 00:31:00,696
After all, he's not from our clan.

638
00:31:01,337 --> 00:31:02,377
Who knows

639
00:31:03,097 --> 00:31:04,097
what's really on his mind?

640
00:31:04,256 --> 00:31:05,216
Ao Lan,

641
00:31:05,577 --> 00:31:07,016
you have been following me

642
00:31:07,016 --> 00:31:08,536
since we were in the Dark Abyss.

643
00:31:08,536 --> 00:31:10,296
I'm very clear

644
00:31:10,296 --> 00:31:11,696
about who is more loyal to me.

645
00:31:11,857 --> 00:31:14,377
I swear to serve the Great Demon God.

646
00:31:15,937 --> 00:31:16,937
(High Priest,)

647
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:19,016
(just enjoy
your little victory for now.)

648
00:31:30,657 --> 00:31:31,937
Why are you coming to me again?

649
00:31:32,456 --> 00:31:34,817
Actually, it's not me this time.

650
00:31:35,456 --> 00:31:37,137
It's the High Priest.

651
00:31:39,536 --> 00:31:40,456
High Priest?

652
00:31:40,817 --> 00:31:42,657
What are you pretending for?

653
00:31:42,897 --> 00:31:43,857
The High Priest has praised you,

654
00:31:43,857 --> 00:31:45,256
saying you are

655
00:31:45,337 --> 00:31:46,857
smart and hardworking

656
00:31:46,857 --> 00:31:48,617
and that you are a rare talent.

657
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:50,016
He wants to cultivate you well.

658
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:51,696
Tell me.

659
00:31:52,056 --> 00:31:53,577
How did you get in touch
with the High Priest?

660
00:31:53,577 --> 00:31:54,456
But I have never

661
00:31:55,216 --> 00:31:55,897
met

662
00:31:55,897 --> 00:31:57,016
the High Priest before.

663
00:32:00,897 --> 00:32:02,097
(Could it be him?)

664
00:32:03,496 --> 00:32:05,256
Look at the chicken look on your face.

665
00:32:06,016 --> 00:32:06,817
Take it easy.

666
00:32:06,817 --> 00:32:08,976
This mission isn't difficult.

667
00:32:10,377 --> 00:32:11,696
This is a spirit stone

668
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:12,377
that can increase people's level.

669
00:32:12,377 --> 00:32:13,377
Good eye.

670
00:32:14,337 --> 00:32:15,736
This treasure

671
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,817
not only increases cultivation

672
00:32:18,016 --> 00:32:19,736
but also enhances defense.

673
00:32:20,577 --> 00:32:21,577
Don't rush.

674
00:32:22,097 --> 00:32:23,657
The most crucial thing

675
00:32:23,776 --> 00:32:25,216
hasn't been added to it yet.

676
00:32:46,137 --> 00:32:46,736
This...

677
00:32:47,536 --> 00:32:49,216
This is demonized.

678
00:32:49,617 --> 00:32:50,657
Why are you giving it to me?

679
00:32:50,857 --> 00:32:52,577
Who said it's for you?

680
00:32:54,016 --> 00:32:55,296
Such a precious thing

681
00:32:55,296 --> 00:32:57,056
is, of course, for someone important.

682
00:32:57,937 --> 00:32:58,696
Rest assured.

683
00:32:58,857 --> 00:32:59,377
As long as

684
00:32:59,377 --> 00:33:00,736
you complete this mission well,

685
00:33:01,016 --> 00:33:02,617
you'll also get your benefits.

686
00:33:06,937 --> 00:33:07,657
Someone important?

687
00:33:09,016 --> 00:33:10,337
Yu Jingqiu.

688
00:33:10,897 --> 00:33:12,097
Why is it Yu Jingqiu?

689
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:13,736
You ask too many questions.

690
00:33:13,736 --> 00:33:15,657
This is personally ordered
by the High Priest.

691
00:33:15,657 --> 00:33:17,056
It must be done by you.

692
00:33:18,256 --> 00:33:19,817
You just need to make Yu Jingqiu

693
00:33:19,817 --> 00:33:21,657
drink the spiritual liquid.

694
00:33:21,937 --> 00:33:22,776
(It's him.)

695
00:33:23,137 --> 00:33:24,016
(It must be him.)

696
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,456
(He has such a high position
in the Xinhuo Palace.)

697
00:33:26,736 --> 00:33:28,256
(He can monitor my every move.)

698
00:33:28,577 --> 00:33:30,337
(And he's the High Priest
in the Demon Clan,)

699
00:33:30,937 --> 00:33:32,377
(controlling my life.)

700
00:33:33,056 --> 00:33:34,177
Situ Hong,

701
00:33:34,897 --> 00:33:36,016
what are you thinking about?

702
00:33:36,337 --> 00:33:37,976
Surely I'm thinking

703
00:33:38,736 --> 00:33:40,216
about how to complete this mission.

704
00:33:42,016 --> 00:33:43,736
Perform well.

705
00:33:55,776 --> 00:33:57,216
Young Master, do you know?

706
00:33:57,256 --> 00:33:58,857
When you were little,
you were quite naughty.

707
00:33:58,897 --> 00:34:00,736
Even the guards were scared
when they saw you.

708
00:34:02,177 --> 00:34:03,897
But you loved to laugh,

709
00:34:03,897 --> 00:34:05,417
sometimes doing it while eating

710
00:34:05,417 --> 00:34:06,377
and running all over the house.

711
00:34:06,377 --> 00:34:07,976
(If I drag Jingqiu
into the demons' side,)

712
00:34:08,817 --> 00:34:10,257
(will she still be able
to laugh so happily?)

713
00:34:19,217 --> 00:34:19,897
Lady,

714
00:34:20,056 --> 00:34:20,656
I have got a jar

715
00:34:20,656 --> 00:34:21,857
of mellow Cuique wine.

716
00:34:21,976 --> 00:34:23,697
I specially brought it for you to taste.

717
00:34:25,536 --> 00:34:26,536
Good lad,

718
00:34:26,536 --> 00:34:28,217
how did you know I like this?

719
00:34:29,937 --> 00:34:31,417
I'll get some cups right away.

720
00:34:34,297 --> 00:34:35,096
Jingqiu,

721
00:34:35,536 --> 00:34:36,297
I...

722
00:34:36,297 --> 00:34:37,576
I don't remember

723
00:34:37,656 --> 00:34:38,656
what you said before.

724
00:34:39,096 --> 00:34:39,697
Just pretend

725
00:34:39,697 --> 00:34:40,777
nothing happened.

726
00:34:44,897 --> 00:34:45,897
Here are the cups.

727
00:34:46,176 --> 00:34:47,616
Let's have a drink with me.

728
00:34:48,337 --> 00:34:49,257
Today, I am

729
00:34:49,257 --> 00:34:50,656
specially here to bring you wine.

730
00:34:50,857 --> 00:34:51,937
I have got other stuff to do,

731
00:34:51,937 --> 00:34:52,976
so I'm leaving.

732
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:05,697
(It's strange.)

733
00:35:05,817 --> 00:35:06,937
(Was Situ Hong trying)

734
00:35:06,937 --> 00:35:08,056
(to hide something from me just now?)

735
00:35:09,297 --> 00:35:09,976
Xueying.

736
00:35:09,976 --> 00:35:10,536
Jingqiu.

737
00:35:10,897 --> 00:35:12,456
This is the most satisfying gift

738
00:35:12,456 --> 00:35:14,176
I've received these days.

739
00:35:14,176 --> 00:35:15,697
So you like wine?

740
00:35:15,697 --> 00:35:16,176
Next time,

741
00:35:16,176 --> 00:35:17,217
I'll prepare some good wine.

742
00:35:17,217 --> 00:35:17,897
I don't accept any wine

743
00:35:17,897 --> 00:35:18,777
from just any Tom, Dick,

744
00:35:18,777 --> 00:35:19,777
or Harry.

745
00:35:20,337 --> 00:35:21,297
Mrs. Xue.

746
00:35:22,656 --> 00:35:23,576
Mrs. Xue.

747
00:35:23,857 --> 00:35:25,096
Did I do

748
00:35:25,096 --> 00:35:25,897
something wrong

749
00:35:25,897 --> 00:35:26,777
to get on your bad side?

750
00:35:27,257 --> 00:35:27,737
If so,

751
00:35:27,737 --> 00:35:28,857
please let me know

752
00:35:29,056 --> 00:35:29,897
so I can fix it.

753
00:35:29,976 --> 00:35:30,897
I wouldn't dare.

754
00:35:31,616 --> 00:35:33,176
I'm going to leave here.

755
00:35:33,576 --> 00:35:34,456
Your behavior

756
00:35:34,456 --> 00:35:35,737
has nothing to do with me.

757
00:35:36,016 --> 00:35:37,656
I just simply don't like you.

758
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:42,937
What does

759
00:35:43,176 --> 00:35:44,377
Mrs. Xue mean?

760
00:35:46,456 --> 00:35:47,536
She said she was leaving.

761
00:35:50,016 --> 00:35:50,817
What about you?

762
00:35:57,536 --> 00:35:58,576
I understand.

763
00:36:00,217 --> 00:36:00,976
You're leaving too.

764
00:36:01,857 --> 00:36:03,096
Back to your country.

765
00:36:04,257 --> 00:36:05,217
Xueying.

766
00:36:08,016 --> 00:36:09,337
That's my home.

767
00:36:10,096 --> 00:36:10,737
And...

768
00:36:11,056 --> 00:36:11,897
And what?

769
00:36:14,096 --> 00:36:15,817
If I didn't know today,

770
00:36:16,697 --> 00:36:18,217
when were you going to tell me?

771
00:36:21,737 --> 00:36:22,337
I...

772
00:36:24,536 --> 00:36:26,016
I just didn't know

773
00:36:26,496 --> 00:36:27,937
how to tell you.

774
00:36:27,976 --> 00:36:29,737
So you planned to keep it a secret

775
00:36:30,136 --> 00:36:31,377
and then leave without saying goodbye?

776
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:34,697
Yu Jingqiu,

777
00:36:35,417 --> 00:36:36,136
am I so unimportant

778
00:36:36,136 --> 00:36:37,176
to you?

779
00:36:40,616 --> 00:36:42,136
Then you tell me what I should do.

780
00:36:44,217 --> 00:36:45,496
I don't want to leave.

781
00:36:48,096 --> 00:36:49,536
I can't bear to part with you.

782
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:51,576
But my father is dead.

783
00:36:51,937 --> 00:36:53,697
My people need someone
to sit on the throne.

784
00:36:53,817 --> 00:36:54,897
I can't stay.

785
00:36:55,616 --> 00:36:56,737
So no matter what I do,

786
00:36:56,737 --> 00:36:57,656
it's wrong.

787
00:37:00,257 --> 00:37:01,217
If I had known earlier

788
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:02,817
that recovering my memory
would be so agonizing,

789
00:37:04,777 --> 00:37:06,217
I would rather not know

790
00:37:07,417 --> 00:37:09,056
who my parents were
for the rest of my life.

791
00:37:15,016 --> 00:37:15,697
Jingqiu.

792
00:37:18,496 --> 00:37:19,176
Jingqiu.

793
00:37:21,456 --> 00:37:21,937
This is

794
00:37:21,937 --> 00:37:23,176
why I don't like you.

795
00:37:23,377 --> 00:37:24,976
Because you would
make my young master sad.

796
00:37:25,217 --> 00:37:26,217
Don't ever come again.
