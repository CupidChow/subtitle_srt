21
00:01:49,851 --> 00:01:50,691
Today,

22
00:01:50,691 --> 00:01:51,611
for Youyue's sake,

23
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:52,611
I'll let you off the hook.

24
00:01:53,051 --> 00:01:54,372
But if there's a next time,

25
00:01:54,771 --> 00:01:55,372
I won't mind

26
00:01:55,372 --> 00:01:56,732
becoming the one who kills her father.

27
00:01:58,932 --> 00:02:00,012
Xueying, let's go.

28
00:02:00,812 --> 00:02:01,372
Remember,

29
00:02:01,851 --> 00:02:02,452
you should be grateful

30
00:02:02,452 --> 00:02:03,491
for having a good daughter.

31
00:02:07,292 --> 00:02:07,691
Let's go.

32
00:02:09,411 --> 00:02:09,971
Youyue,

33
00:02:10,052 --> 00:02:11,011
let's go too.

34
00:02:12,092 --> 00:02:12,691
Yue.

35
00:02:14,772 --> 00:02:15,691
Yue.

36
00:02:24,052 --> 00:02:24,772
Why

37
00:02:26,772 --> 00:02:28,451
would you be so heartless

38
00:02:28,451 --> 00:02:29,772
to hire an assassin?

39
00:02:30,652 --> 00:02:31,731
It wasn't me.

40
00:02:31,971 --> 00:02:33,252
The assassin you hired

41
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,532
almost killed me.

42
00:02:35,772 --> 00:02:37,092
Do you know that?

43
00:02:37,891 --> 00:02:38,731
Yu Jingqiu

44
00:02:38,891 --> 00:02:40,052
risked her life

45
00:02:40,332 --> 00:02:41,532
to save me.

46
00:02:42,332 --> 00:02:43,372
But you...

47
00:02:44,131 --> 00:02:46,291
you almost killed her.

48
00:02:46,932 --> 00:02:47,851
I did all this

49
00:02:48,291 --> 00:02:49,571
for your sake.

50
00:02:50,011 --> 00:02:51,011
Who else

51
00:02:51,252 --> 00:02:52,252
has a disappointing daughter

52
00:02:52,252 --> 00:02:53,411
like you?

53
00:02:53,691 --> 00:02:54,772
If it weren't

54
00:02:55,652 --> 00:02:57,492
for your inability to win
Dongbo Xueying's heart,

55
00:02:58,212 --> 00:02:59,731
I wouldn't have to do this.

56
00:03:02,691 --> 00:03:03,372
Fine.

57
00:03:05,532 --> 00:03:06,851
From now on,

58
00:03:08,652 --> 00:03:09,492
don't consider me

59
00:03:09,492 --> 00:03:10,652
your daughter anymore.

60
00:03:11,372 --> 00:03:12,131
Yue.

61
00:03:13,451 --> 00:03:14,212
Yue.

62
00:03:15,731 --> 00:03:16,571
Yue.

63
00:03:46,052 --> 00:03:46,812
My friend,

64
00:03:46,932 --> 00:03:47,891
you came.

65
00:03:48,772 --> 00:03:50,252
Now I only have you

66
00:03:50,252 --> 00:03:51,772
as my friend.

67
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:53,772
Let's toast together

68
00:03:53,772 --> 00:03:55,212
for our unique friendship.

69
00:03:55,492 --> 00:03:56,291
Cheers.

70
00:04:01,451 --> 00:04:02,451
Cheers.

71
00:04:06,212 --> 00:04:06,812
Youyue,

72
00:04:07,451 --> 00:04:08,731
you've been drinking all night.

73
00:04:08,812 --> 00:04:10,011
You haven't eaten anything, have you?

74
00:04:10,411 --> 00:04:11,932
Your stomach is empty now.

75
00:04:11,932 --> 00:04:13,252
It's not good for your wound.

76
00:04:13,812 --> 00:04:14,731
I went to the food stall next door

77
00:04:14,731 --> 00:04:15,612
and bought you a pancake.

78
00:04:15,612 --> 00:04:16,492
Take a bite.

79
00:04:37,812 --> 00:04:38,691
I bit you.

80
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:40,852
Why didn't you say a word?

81
00:04:41,372 --> 00:04:42,492
So boring.

82
00:04:49,252 --> 00:04:50,412
Do you know?

83
00:04:51,852 --> 00:04:53,691
When I was little,

84
00:04:55,011 --> 00:04:56,492
whenever I was unhappy,

85
00:04:57,891 --> 00:04:59,331
I liked to bite people.

86
00:05:01,172 --> 00:05:02,451
But back then,

87
00:05:03,011 --> 00:05:04,492
people around me would say

88
00:05:05,172 --> 00:05:07,172
my temperament was too wild

89
00:05:07,771 --> 00:05:09,771
and that I didn't have
the demeanor of a girl at all.

90
00:05:11,172 --> 00:05:12,292
But my father,

91
00:05:13,331 --> 00:05:14,372
only my father

92
00:05:14,732 --> 00:05:16,331
never scolded me.

93
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:18,451
Every time I bit him,

94
00:05:20,571 --> 00:05:21,131
he

95
00:05:21,651 --> 00:05:23,531
never said a word, either.

96
00:05:25,771 --> 00:05:26,852
My father said

97
00:05:28,011 --> 00:05:30,091
I was the bright moon in the sky

98
00:05:30,852 --> 00:05:31,932
and that I should be

99
00:05:32,172 --> 00:05:34,052
free and unrestrained.

100
00:05:37,412 --> 00:05:38,451
He also said

101
00:05:39,252 --> 00:05:40,292
even if I poked a big hole

102
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,052
in the sky,

103
00:05:42,972 --> 00:05:44,891
he would go find Goddess Nuwa

104
00:05:45,651 --> 00:05:47,412
to fix it all for me.

105
00:05:51,571 --> 00:05:52,812
But look.

106
00:05:55,172 --> 00:05:56,172
Look.

107
00:05:59,252 --> 00:06:01,131
The moon is gone now,

108
00:06:03,131 --> 00:06:04,932
and my father is gone too.

109
00:06:16,812 --> 00:06:18,131
Goddess Nuwa,

110
00:06:19,052 --> 00:06:20,011
where's my father?

111
00:06:21,492 --> 00:06:23,331
Did you see my father?

112
00:06:23,932 --> 00:06:25,211
My father is missing.

113
00:06:25,372 --> 00:06:26,252
Youyue.

114
00:06:28,771 --> 00:06:29,331
Youyue.

115
00:06:29,571 --> 00:06:31,252
My father is missing.

116
00:06:32,011 --> 00:06:32,891
Listen to me,

117
00:06:33,412 --> 00:06:34,651
you only see the moon in the west

118
00:06:34,651 --> 00:06:35,691
is about to fall.

119
00:06:36,011 --> 00:06:37,331
But look at the other side,

120
00:06:37,451 --> 00:06:38,131
the sun in the east

121
00:06:38,211 --> 00:06:39,451
is about to rise.

122
00:06:52,531 --> 00:06:53,612
Where's the wine?

123
00:06:53,732 --> 00:06:55,052
Alright, Youyue.

124
00:06:55,172 --> 00:06:55,812
No more drinking.

125
00:06:58,852 --> 00:06:59,571
Youyue.

126
00:07:02,531 --> 00:07:04,011
No more wine.

127
00:07:26,492 --> 00:07:27,091
Youyue.

128
00:07:40,531 --> 00:07:42,211
(The sun's rays)

129
00:07:42,211 --> 00:07:43,252
(are more dazzling,)

130
00:07:43,451 --> 00:07:44,451
(more warming,)

131
00:07:45,732 --> 00:07:47,011
(and more protective of you.)

132
00:07:48,771 --> 00:07:49,691
(Don't worry.)

133
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:51,651
From now on,

134
00:07:52,172 --> 00:07:53,852
I'll protect you like the sun.

135
00:08:17,651 --> 00:08:18,451
Youyue.

136
00:08:20,331 --> 00:08:20,972
Youyue.

137
00:08:22,211 --> 00:08:22,691
Youyue.

138
00:08:25,091 --> 00:08:26,372
Y-Y-You've been asleep all day.

139
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:27,091
You must be hungry.

140
00:08:27,091 --> 00:08:28,451
Come and have a bite to eat, okay?

141
00:08:29,011 --> 00:08:29,492
I...

142
00:08:29,531 --> 00:08:30,412
Go, go.

143
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:33,051
You sit here.

144
00:08:36,092 --> 00:08:37,332
This is your favorite bun.

145
00:08:37,332 --> 00:08:38,171
Eat.

146
00:08:41,612 --> 00:08:42,492
Jingqiu,

147
00:08:42,492 --> 00:08:43,531
I'm sorry.

148
00:08:44,411 --> 00:08:45,651
My father...

149
00:08:46,531 --> 00:08:47,811
So much talk at breakfast.

150
00:08:48,051 --> 00:08:48,891
If you don't eat, I will.

151
00:08:49,531 --> 00:08:50,732
Who said I was not eating?

152
00:08:50,732 --> 00:08:52,252
This is the bun Jingqiu gave me.

153
00:08:52,252 --> 00:08:53,531
That is the bun I gave Youyue.

154
00:08:53,531 --> 00:08:54,372
Why did you take it?

155
00:08:54,372 --> 00:08:55,212
Give it back to her quickly.

156
00:08:57,692 --> 00:08:58,411
Alright, alright.

157
00:08:58,411 --> 00:08:59,531
I'll go get a few more buns.

158
00:08:59,732 --> 00:09:00,572
How many do you want?

159
00:09:00,692 --> 00:09:01,291
Five.

160
00:09:03,332 --> 00:09:04,291
You eat more.

161
00:09:08,531 --> 00:09:09,732
Have the meal.

162
00:09:10,531 --> 00:09:11,692
Eat this.

163
00:09:23,212 --> 00:09:25,291
(A delicious meal
with added sleeping spell.)

164
00:09:25,492 --> 00:09:26,891
(It guarantees everyone)

165
00:09:26,891 --> 00:09:28,252
(will sleep soundly tonight.)

166
00:09:31,931 --> 00:09:32,651
Rong,

167
00:09:33,771 --> 00:09:34,452
I, you...

168
00:09:35,852 --> 00:09:37,372
Why are you dressed like this?

169
00:09:38,692 --> 00:09:39,531
Qingshi,

170
00:09:39,811 --> 00:09:40,771
I'm going to show off

171
00:09:40,771 --> 00:09:41,811
my cooking skills to everyone.

172
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:43,891
I can't dress too fancy while cooking.

173
00:09:43,891 --> 00:09:44,572
This way,

174
00:09:44,651 --> 00:09:46,452
even if I dirty my clothes,
I won't feel bad.

175
00:09:46,692 --> 00:09:47,811
How can you not feel bad?

176
00:09:47,811 --> 00:09:48,732
I feel bad.

177
00:09:49,011 --> 00:09:50,051
You came to the Xueying Territory,

178
00:09:50,051 --> 00:09:51,332
and you're our guest.

179
00:09:51,931 --> 00:09:53,411
How can we let you cook for us?

180
00:09:53,771 --> 00:09:55,612
You've been so hospitable,

181
00:09:55,612 --> 00:09:57,051
and I want to show my gratitude for it.

182
00:09:57,811 --> 00:09:59,332
So I'd like to cook personally for you

183
00:09:59,332 --> 00:10:00,612
as a way of saying thank you.

184
00:10:01,612 --> 00:10:02,372
You are

185
00:10:02,372 --> 00:10:03,452
just too kind,

186
00:10:03,572 --> 00:10:04,931
always thinking of others.

187
00:10:06,092 --> 00:10:07,411
I'll go serve the dishes first.

188
00:10:10,212 --> 00:10:11,131
Listen to me.

189
00:10:11,612 --> 00:10:12,732
There are people

190
00:10:12,732 --> 00:10:13,732
who will serve the dishes.

191
00:10:14,051 --> 00:10:14,531
You

192
00:10:14,612 --> 00:10:16,011
just go change your clothes.

193
00:10:16,171 --> 00:10:17,531
I won't allow you to wear this

194
00:10:17,531 --> 00:10:18,131
to dinner.

195
00:10:19,092 --> 00:10:20,692
What about all this other stuff?

196
00:10:20,692 --> 00:10:22,212
Leave it to me. Don't worry.

197
00:10:23,411 --> 00:10:24,332
Rest assured.

198
00:10:24,452 --> 00:10:25,771
Go, go.

199
00:10:25,771 --> 00:10:26,771
Leave it to me.

200
00:10:27,852 --> 00:10:29,291
Just go.

201
00:10:42,131 --> 00:10:43,492
(Oh, no!)

202
00:10:43,651 --> 00:10:44,131
(Oh!)

203
00:10:44,771 --> 00:10:45,531
(Oh my...)

204
00:10:45,692 --> 00:10:47,092
(Ji Rong is tired enough already.)

205
00:10:47,332 --> 00:10:49,011
(I can't cause her more trouble.)

206
00:10:50,212 --> 00:10:51,492
(Isn't it just cooking?)

207
00:10:51,771 --> 00:10:52,811
(I can even learn)

208
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:53,651
(advanced spells.)

209
00:10:53,931 --> 00:10:55,492
(Cooking must)

210
00:10:55,692 --> 00:10:57,092
(be a piece of cake.)

211
00:10:58,531 --> 00:10:59,452
(With my thunder fire,)

212
00:10:59,452 --> 00:11:00,891
(how can I not cook?)

213
00:11:30,651 --> 00:11:32,051
Why are these so black?

214
00:11:40,411 --> 00:11:41,051
No need for formalities.

215
00:11:41,252 --> 00:11:41,811
Everyone,

216
00:11:42,092 --> 00:11:42,811
please take a seat.

217
00:11:43,852 --> 00:11:44,651
Come, Rong.

218
00:11:44,732 --> 00:11:45,372
Well,

219
00:11:45,612 --> 00:11:47,452
today's dinner

220
00:11:47,972 --> 00:11:50,171
is particularly special.

221
00:11:50,171 --> 00:11:51,212
Of course.

222
00:11:51,492 --> 00:11:52,291
Today's dishes

223
00:11:52,291 --> 00:11:53,372
are personally cooked

224
00:11:53,372 --> 00:11:54,651
by Ji Rong.

225
00:11:56,212 --> 00:11:57,972
I've been living
in the Xueying Territory for so long,

226
00:11:57,972 --> 00:11:59,092
causing everyone

227
00:11:59,332 --> 00:12:00,931
so much trouble.

228
00:12:01,131 --> 00:12:02,051
I have nothing

229
00:12:02,051 --> 00:12:03,252
to repay you.

230
00:12:03,572 --> 00:12:05,092
Only my cooking skills are decent.

231
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:06,332
I'll use this meal

232
00:12:06,332 --> 00:12:07,372
to express my gratitude.

233
00:12:07,771 --> 00:12:09,011
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong San,

234
00:12:09,092 --> 00:12:10,531
you must taste

235
00:12:10,732 --> 00:12:11,692
the dishes cooked by Ji Rong.

236
00:12:11,692 --> 00:12:13,612
They are top-notch delicacies
in the world.

237
00:12:15,531 --> 00:12:16,291
- Yes.
- Yes.

238
00:12:16,531 --> 00:12:17,291
Let's eat then.

239
00:12:17,452 --> 00:12:18,051
Bros.

240
00:12:18,771 --> 00:12:19,492
- You eat.
- You eat.

241
00:12:19,492 --> 00:12:20,212
You eat.

242
00:12:21,572 --> 00:12:22,291
(Did the sleeping spell)

243
00:12:22,651 --> 00:12:23,452
(cause a change)

244
00:12:23,452 --> 00:12:24,811
(in the dishes?)

245
00:12:30,852 --> 00:12:31,811
I feel like I'm struck

246
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:33,332
by lightning.

247
00:12:34,131 --> 00:12:35,492
Really, Uncle Tong San?

248
00:12:35,572 --> 00:12:37,212
Maybe it's because the food is too good.

249
00:12:37,291 --> 00:12:38,692
Try this one.

250
00:12:40,291 --> 00:12:40,972
Come on.

251
00:12:42,291 --> 00:12:43,252
Taste it.

252
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:44,651
Here you are. This is delicious.

253
00:12:54,452 --> 00:12:55,572
This is not the dish I cooked.

254
00:12:57,891 --> 00:12:59,011
Well, who was it then?

255
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,092
Who cooked it?

256
00:13:00,092 --> 00:13:00,692
Yeah.

257
00:13:03,051 --> 00:13:04,171
I'm sorry, Rong.

258
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,771
It was me.

259
00:13:05,771 --> 00:13:07,131
I accidentally knocked it over.

260
00:13:09,291 --> 00:13:10,291
(So that's what happened.)

261
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,852
It's okay.

262
00:13:13,372 --> 00:13:14,171
Then you specially

263
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:15,852
cooked a whole table
of dishes to make up for it.

264
00:13:16,411 --> 00:13:17,291
It's very thoughtful.

265
00:13:17,572 --> 00:13:18,452
I'm very touched.

266
00:13:18,972 --> 00:13:20,411
Qingshi, you cooked it?

267
00:13:20,692 --> 00:13:22,011
No wonder it feels
like being struck by lightning.

268
00:13:26,411 --> 00:13:27,291
Uncle Tong San.

269
00:13:30,291 --> 00:13:31,212
Everyone, please wait a moment.

270
00:13:31,212 --> 00:13:32,452
I'll make soup for you again.

271
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:33,411
I'll be back soon.

272
00:13:33,492 --> 00:13:34,811
- Alright.
- Alright.

273
00:13:36,771 --> 00:13:37,732
Fine.

274
00:13:39,852 --> 00:13:41,212
Is it that horrible?

275
00:13:41,291 --> 00:13:42,131
Come on, drink.

276
00:13:42,252 --> 00:13:43,212
Let's get hammered.

277
00:13:43,732 --> 00:13:44,492
- Fill it up.
- Come on.

278
00:14:08,291 --> 00:14:09,452
This soup is so delicious.

279
00:14:09,452 --> 00:14:09,852
Delicious.

280
00:14:09,852 --> 00:14:10,891
- Yes.
- It's really delicious.

281
00:14:14,011 --> 00:14:14,732
So delicious.

282
00:14:15,131 --> 00:14:15,452
It's so good.

283
00:14:15,452 --> 00:14:16,051
It's been a long time

284
00:14:16,051 --> 00:14:17,051
since I've had such a delicious soup.

285
00:14:17,051 --> 00:14:18,372
Have more if you like it.

286
00:14:18,572 --> 00:14:19,732
I cooked a lot.

287
00:14:19,972 --> 00:14:21,651
Every soldier of the Xueying Territory

288
00:14:21,651 --> 00:14:22,492
has a share.

289
00:14:23,811 --> 00:14:24,171
That's great.

290
00:14:24,171 --> 00:14:24,852
Qingshi,

291
00:14:24,852 --> 00:14:26,092
how is it? Is it tasty?

292
00:14:26,332 --> 00:14:26,931
Yeah.

293
00:14:30,492 --> 00:14:31,452
I'll have another bowl.

294
00:14:32,131 --> 00:14:33,092
Is there more?

295
00:14:33,092 --> 00:14:33,771
Yes.

296
00:15:08,852 --> 00:15:10,011
Everything's settled?

297
00:15:10,411 --> 00:15:12,051
Yes. Follow me.

298
00:15:24,171 --> 00:15:25,891
This is Dongbo Lie's tomb?

299
00:15:26,011 --> 00:15:27,531
That's right. It's here.

300
00:15:29,771 --> 00:15:31,372
All of you guard outside

301
00:15:31,411 --> 00:15:32,732
until I give you a message.

302
00:15:33,492 --> 00:15:34,131
Remember.

303
00:15:34,771 --> 00:15:36,011
Don't let anyone

304
00:15:36,051 --> 00:15:36,771
approach this place.

305
00:15:36,771 --> 00:15:37,612
- Yes.
- Yes.

306
00:16:09,051 --> 00:16:10,492
Why does my head hurt so much?

307
00:16:11,011 --> 00:16:12,092
And I feel a little dizzy.

308
00:16:13,291 --> 00:16:14,011
Did I eat

309
00:16:14,011 --> 00:16:15,011
something wrong tonight?

310
00:17:24,851 --> 00:17:25,692
Strange.

311
00:17:25,972 --> 00:17:26,932
Why didn't I see

312
00:17:27,091 --> 00:17:27,771
a single guard

313
00:17:27,771 --> 00:17:28,692
all the way here?

314
00:17:32,492 --> 00:17:32,972
Who's there?

315
00:17:35,692 --> 00:17:36,492
Demons.

316
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:51,452
That...

317
00:17:51,932 --> 00:17:53,051
That is Qingshi.

318
00:18:02,571 --> 00:18:04,011
How is it possible

319
00:18:04,571 --> 00:18:05,132
that a small mage

320
00:18:05,132 --> 00:18:06,252
has such a huge power?

321
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,291
Ji Rong,

322
00:18:07,692 --> 00:18:08,972
don't let him know our purpose.

323
00:18:09,571 --> 00:18:10,652
Use the Slumber Spell

324
00:18:11,011 --> 00:18:11,851
to stop him.

325
00:18:14,051 --> 00:18:14,571
Yes.

326
00:18:27,531 --> 00:18:29,091
I don't care who you are.

327
00:18:30,051 --> 00:18:30,972
I won't let any of you

328
00:18:30,972 --> 00:18:32,172
disturb my father.

329
00:18:33,011 --> 00:18:34,172
Never.

330
00:18:35,132 --> 00:18:35,972
Qingshi.

331
00:18:36,412 --> 00:18:37,172
Qingshi.

332
00:18:39,331 --> 00:18:40,172
Rong.

333
00:18:50,147 --> 00:18:53,769
(Xueying Territory)

334
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:28,571
Qingshi.

335
00:19:31,371 --> 00:19:32,732
Qingshi, you're awake.

336
00:19:33,652 --> 00:19:34,371
Father.

337
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:38,851
Father.

338
00:19:39,132 --> 00:19:39,732
Father.

339
00:19:41,811 --> 00:19:42,611
Qingshi.

340
00:19:52,132 --> 00:19:54,011
Qingshi, what happened to you?

341
00:19:54,972 --> 00:19:55,652
Rong,

342
00:19:55,851 --> 00:19:56,892
there were demons here last night.

343
00:19:56,892 --> 00:19:57,811
So many demons.

344
00:19:57,811 --> 00:19:58,652
I saw them with my own eyes

345
00:19:58,652 --> 00:19:59,811
right in front of my father's tomb.

346
00:19:59,811 --> 00:20:00,972
Then I used the Lightning Technique

347
00:20:00,972 --> 00:20:02,291
and I killed them all.

348
00:20:03,291 --> 00:20:03,771
But now,

349
00:20:03,771 --> 00:20:05,011
why is there nothing left?

350
00:20:06,172 --> 00:20:07,091
Qingshi,

351
00:20:07,132 --> 00:20:08,291
there was no lightning

352
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,492
and no demons last night.

353
00:20:09,892 --> 00:20:11,732
It was all just a dream.

354
00:20:11,932 --> 00:20:12,452
A dream?

355
00:20:12,571 --> 00:20:13,571
How could it be?

356
00:20:13,972 --> 00:20:15,212
It felt so real.

357
00:20:19,371 --> 00:20:21,011
I was worried about you last night,

358
00:20:21,252 --> 00:20:22,611
so I came to check on you.

359
00:20:23,172 --> 00:20:24,811
But you were having a nightmare.

360
00:20:25,132 --> 00:20:26,652
You kept calling
for your father in your sleep.

361
00:20:27,051 --> 00:20:28,291
I wanted to wake you up,

362
00:20:28,291 --> 00:20:29,571
but I couldn't.

363
00:20:29,932 --> 00:20:31,452
I wanted to find someone to help,

364
00:20:31,652 --> 00:20:32,732
but you kept holding my hand

365
00:20:32,732 --> 00:20:33,531
and wouldn't let me go.

366
00:20:34,172 --> 00:20:35,652
So I stayed with you.

367
00:20:37,571 --> 00:20:38,531
Really?

368
00:20:39,132 --> 00:20:40,571
It was all just a dream?

369
00:20:42,252 --> 00:20:43,611
H-H-How could this be?

370
00:20:44,972 --> 00:20:46,492
This is the mark you left on my hand.

371
00:20:46,492 --> 00:20:47,371
Did you forget?

372
00:20:49,811 --> 00:20:50,851
I'm sorry, Rong.

373
00:20:51,252 --> 00:20:52,732
I'm sorry. I...

374
00:20:53,492 --> 00:20:54,732
I'm fine.

375
00:20:55,571 --> 00:20:56,692
You came here early in the morning

376
00:20:56,692 --> 00:20:58,371
barefoot.

377
00:20:58,492 --> 00:20:59,091
If Uncle Tong San

378
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:00,452
knows it,

379
00:21:00,452 --> 00:21:01,771
he'll blame me again.

380
00:21:03,412 --> 00:21:04,412
How could I...?

381
00:21:04,692 --> 00:21:05,571
How could I have such a dream?

382
00:21:05,571 --> 00:21:06,051
Come.

383
00:21:09,172 --> 00:21:09,811
Let's go.

384
00:21:10,011 --> 00:21:11,331
Let's put your shoes on first.

385
00:21:18,652 --> 00:21:19,331
I'll help you put them on.

386
00:21:20,252 --> 00:21:20,692
I...

387
00:21:20,892 --> 00:21:21,811
I can do it myself.

388
00:21:31,291 --> 00:21:33,571
No progress on the new Demon Well,

389
00:21:33,851 --> 00:21:36,172
but the Black Armored Warriors
were wiped out.

390
00:21:37,771 --> 00:21:38,571
Ao Lan,

391
00:21:38,932 --> 00:21:40,932
how dare you say
the warriors aren't strong enough!

392
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:43,252
They are controlled by me alone.

393
00:21:43,291 --> 00:21:44,331
So you're implying

394
00:21:44,331 --> 00:21:45,851
I'm not capable?

395
00:21:45,972 --> 00:21:47,291
Master, please calm down.

396
00:21:48,091 --> 00:21:48,892
But...

397
00:21:49,531 --> 00:21:51,172
I never expected

398
00:21:52,132 --> 00:21:53,132
Dongbo Qingshi,

399
00:21:53,132 --> 00:21:54,611
who's merely a small mage,

400
00:21:54,972 --> 00:21:56,132
to single-handedly defeat

401
00:21:56,132 --> 00:21:57,692
the Black Armored Warriors.

402
00:21:57,811 --> 00:21:59,011
It's really strange.

403
00:21:59,571 --> 00:22:00,531
The Black Armored Warriors

404
00:22:00,531 --> 00:22:01,692
are the key

405
00:22:01,692 --> 00:22:02,611
to unlocking the Demon Well.

406
00:22:02,692 --> 00:22:04,252
If they are not strong enough,

407
00:22:04,771 --> 00:22:05,531
it will definitely affect

408
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:07,132
your plan to make a comeback.

409
00:22:07,371 --> 00:22:08,892
Please reconsider, Master.

410
00:22:09,331 --> 00:22:09,892
You...

411
00:22:10,132 --> 00:22:11,172
Alright.

412
00:22:11,412 --> 00:22:12,771
Ao Lan is right.

413
00:22:13,011 --> 00:22:14,531
Restoring my body

414
00:22:14,531 --> 00:22:15,851
is urgent.

415
00:22:16,132 --> 00:22:17,371
The Black Armored Warriors

416
00:22:17,371 --> 00:22:18,972
need to be stronger.

417
00:22:19,371 --> 00:22:20,692
It's my negligence.

418
00:22:21,132 --> 00:22:21,892
But...

419
00:22:21,892 --> 00:22:22,652
the demonization process

420
00:22:22,652 --> 00:22:24,091
does take time.

421
00:22:24,492 --> 00:22:25,851
I'm afraid it's not possible
in a short time...

422
00:22:25,851 --> 00:22:26,732
Master,

423
00:22:28,371 --> 00:22:29,571
I have an idea.

424
00:22:30,652 --> 00:22:31,652
Tell us.

425
00:22:31,652 --> 00:22:32,371
We spend a lot of time

426
00:22:32,371 --> 00:22:33,252
making ordinary people

427
00:22:33,252 --> 00:22:34,652
Black Armored Warriors,

428
00:22:35,291 --> 00:22:36,571
and their strength

429
00:22:36,571 --> 00:22:37,371
is just average.

430
00:22:37,972 --> 00:22:38,692
So why don't we find

431
00:22:38,692 --> 00:22:40,011
some exceptionally skilled individuals

432
00:22:40,011 --> 00:22:41,811
who are already strong

433
00:22:41,811 --> 00:22:42,932
and make them demons?

434
00:22:43,371 --> 00:22:44,932
Then we can do more with less.

435
00:22:45,011 --> 00:22:45,771
What a joke!

436
00:22:46,212 --> 00:22:47,452
Are exceptional people

437
00:22:47,452 --> 00:22:49,011
that easy to find?

438
00:22:49,011 --> 00:22:50,212
Isn't there a perfect opportunity

439
00:22:50,212 --> 00:22:51,212
right now?

440
00:22:52,172 --> 00:22:54,212
The Transcendent Trial
is about to begin.

441
00:22:54,371 --> 00:22:55,732
The young people who participate

442
00:22:55,732 --> 00:22:56,892
are all very capable.

443
00:22:57,892 --> 00:22:59,972
If we control and use

444
00:22:59,972 --> 00:23:01,291
a Transcendent Knight,

445
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:03,771
we are bound to gain something.

446
00:23:03,972 --> 00:23:05,011
Master, please reconsider.

447
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,611
There will be many Transcendent Knights

448
00:23:07,932 --> 00:23:09,412
and strong protective barriers
at the Transcendent Trial.

449
00:23:09,811 --> 00:23:10,611
What's worse,

450
00:23:11,091 --> 00:23:13,051
the barriers are controlled
by Chi Qiubai.

451
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:14,452
If we act rashly,

452
00:23:14,692 --> 00:23:16,492
it may alert
the Xia Clan's Transcendent cultivators.

453
00:23:16,492 --> 00:23:17,932
Please reconsider, Master.

454
00:23:18,091 --> 00:23:19,252
High Priest,

455
00:23:19,892 --> 00:23:21,892
aren't you being too cautious?

456
00:23:22,851 --> 00:23:25,011
Merely Chi Qiubai

457
00:23:25,252 --> 00:23:27,091
can make you so scared.

458
00:23:27,091 --> 00:23:28,291
What did you say?

459
00:23:29,412 --> 00:23:30,452
High Priest,

460
00:23:30,811 --> 00:23:31,732
the Black Armored Warriors

461
00:23:31,732 --> 00:23:32,851
are the linchpin

462
00:23:32,972 --> 00:23:33,972
of my plan.

463
00:23:34,091 --> 00:23:35,972
You must hurry the demonization.

464
00:23:35,972 --> 00:23:37,132
The more, the better.

465
00:23:37,331 --> 00:23:37,811
Yes.

466
00:23:38,811 --> 00:23:40,972
As for the plan to capture
the new Transcendent cultivators...

467
00:23:41,132 --> 00:23:41,811
Ao Lan,

468
00:23:41,932 --> 00:23:43,811
are you confident
in dealing with Chi Qiubai?

469
00:23:43,811 --> 00:23:45,091
It's time

470
00:23:45,571 --> 00:23:47,811
to make Chi Qiubai choose.

471
00:23:48,132 --> 00:23:48,892
Alright.

472
00:23:49,011 --> 00:23:50,811
I'll leave this matter to you.

473
00:23:50,811 --> 00:23:51,932
Understood.

474
00:23:53,291 --> 00:23:54,412
Remember,

475
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:55,972
now the most important thing

476
00:23:55,972 --> 00:23:57,091
is to carry out the plan.

477
00:23:57,331 --> 00:23:58,771
Those who contribute will be rewarded,

478
00:23:58,851 --> 00:23:59,892
and those who make mistakes

479
00:24:00,291 --> 00:24:01,652
will be punished.

480
00:24:02,291 --> 00:24:02,972
Yes.

481
00:24:03,732 --> 00:24:04,291
Yes.

482
00:24:31,652 --> 00:24:32,531
Xiaoxi.

483
00:24:34,732 --> 00:24:36,011
Xiaoxi is still alive?

484
00:24:37,452 --> 00:24:38,652
This is her energy core?

485
00:24:38,771 --> 00:24:39,531
Right.

486
00:24:40,212 --> 00:24:42,011
This is Bu Xiaoxi's energy core.

487
00:24:42,771 --> 00:24:43,732
So now,

488
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:45,331
can you talk to me nicely?

489
00:24:46,291 --> 00:24:47,732
You despicable person.

490
00:24:48,371 --> 00:24:49,571
What exactly do you want to do?

491
00:24:51,091 --> 00:24:52,732
This Divine Datura Flower

492
00:24:53,371 --> 00:24:54,972
is a treasure in the Demon Realm.

493
00:24:55,291 --> 00:24:57,011
It survives
by absorbing cultivators' energy cores

494
00:24:57,172 --> 00:24:58,652
and can also nourish them.

495
00:24:59,212 --> 00:25:00,412
If it hadn't been for it,

496
00:25:00,611 --> 00:25:01,331
your woman

497
00:25:01,331 --> 00:25:02,932
would have already been destroyed.

498
00:25:05,132 --> 00:25:06,571
It is said that the Divine Datura Flower

499
00:25:06,611 --> 00:25:08,252
can drain the spiritual power
of an energy core

500
00:25:08,252 --> 00:25:09,132
once a day,

501
00:25:09,732 --> 00:25:11,091
then restore it

502
00:25:11,531 --> 00:25:12,892
and start again,

503
00:25:13,732 --> 00:25:15,291
making its owner suffer agony.

504
00:25:16,212 --> 00:25:17,972
Only by using
our clan's secret techniques

505
00:25:17,972 --> 00:25:19,492
can the seal be undone.

506
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:20,692
Maybe I will even allow you

507
00:25:20,692 --> 00:25:21,892
to see her one last time.

508
00:25:22,412 --> 00:25:23,172
What do you think?

509
00:25:23,692 --> 00:25:25,531
Is that good enough for you?

510
00:25:25,571 --> 00:25:26,331
Ao Lan,

511
00:25:28,492 --> 00:25:29,851
what exactly do you want?

512
00:25:32,571 --> 00:25:33,611
As we all know,

513
00:25:33,692 --> 00:25:35,571
you're extraordinary.

514
00:25:36,051 --> 00:25:37,851
And you are the youngest one

515
00:25:38,011 --> 00:25:39,412
to enter the Transcendent Realm

516
00:25:39,492 --> 00:25:40,811
on the Dragon Mountain Continent.

517
00:25:41,611 --> 00:25:42,331
So,

518
00:25:43,571 --> 00:25:45,692
I want you to help
our Demon God Association.

519
00:25:46,732 --> 00:25:47,692
Don't even think about it.

520
00:25:48,492 --> 00:25:49,611
I am at odds

521
00:25:49,851 --> 00:25:51,172
with the Demon Clan.

522
00:25:52,771 --> 00:25:53,892
Chi Qiubai,

523
00:25:54,132 --> 00:25:55,972
don't speak too soon.

524
00:25:56,172 --> 00:25:58,051
We will meet again eventually.

525
00:26:27,892 --> 00:26:29,212
Xueying.

526
00:26:41,331 --> 00:26:41,932
(Mother,)

527
00:26:42,732 --> 00:26:43,531
(wait for me.)

528
00:26:44,492 --> 00:26:46,452
(I will soon enter
the Transcendent Realm.)

529
00:26:57,371 --> 00:26:58,091
Jingqiu,

530
00:26:58,291 --> 00:26:59,932
that move you just used was amazing.

531
00:26:59,932 --> 00:27:00,932
Can you teach me?

532
00:27:02,132 --> 00:27:02,892
Youyue,

533
00:27:03,371 --> 00:27:04,172
you won't be able

534
00:27:04,172 --> 00:27:05,291
to learn Jingqiu's move.

535
00:27:05,492 --> 00:27:07,011
How about this? I'll teach you

536
00:27:07,011 --> 00:27:08,011
something practical.

537
00:27:08,051 --> 00:27:09,412
What I want is a move that can be used

538
00:27:09,412 --> 00:27:11,331
in the Transcendent Battle
of Life and Death.

539
00:27:11,531 --> 00:27:13,132
Don't waste my time

540
00:27:13,132 --> 00:27:13,932
with your amateur moves.

541
00:27:14,011 --> 00:27:16,172
You want to participate in the battle?

542
00:27:16,972 --> 00:27:18,531
Do you know why the Transcendent Trial

543
00:27:18,531 --> 00:27:19,291
is called

544
00:27:19,291 --> 00:27:20,412
the Transcendent Battle
of Life and Death?

545
00:27:20,611 --> 00:27:22,412
Although it is not

546
00:27:22,412 --> 00:27:23,051
lethal,

547
00:27:23,051 --> 00:27:23,611
it is still

548
00:27:23,611 --> 00:27:24,571
pretty savage.

549
00:27:24,571 --> 00:27:25,371
It is said that everyone

550
00:27:25,371 --> 00:27:26,331
who wants to step
into the Transcendent Realm

551
00:27:26,331 --> 00:27:27,371
has to go there,

552
00:27:27,531 --> 00:27:28,892
breaking through their limits

553
00:27:28,932 --> 00:27:30,291
and experiencing
the test of life and death.

554
00:27:30,291 --> 00:27:31,611
So what's your purpose

555
00:27:31,611 --> 00:27:32,291
in coming to Changfeng Academy?

556
00:27:32,331 --> 00:27:34,212
Isn't it to break through yourself

557
00:27:34,212 --> 00:27:35,252
and challenge the tasks

558
00:27:35,252 --> 00:27:36,611
you couldn't complete before?

559
00:27:36,811 --> 00:27:37,452
Jingqiu,

560
00:27:38,091 --> 00:27:38,851
I know

561
00:27:38,972 --> 00:27:40,212
I'm not as good as you,

562
00:27:40,212 --> 00:27:41,051
but I don't want

563
00:27:41,051 --> 00:27:42,011
to be too far behind you.

564
00:27:42,252 --> 00:27:43,291
Can you teach me?

565
00:27:43,291 --> 00:27:43,892
Of course.

566
00:27:43,892 --> 00:27:45,412
I'll teach you the method

567
00:27:45,412 --> 00:27:46,371
of improving your spiritual power later.

568
00:27:46,611 --> 00:27:47,011
Okay.

569
00:27:47,492 --> 00:27:48,132
Then I'll participate, too.

570
00:27:48,331 --> 00:27:49,611
I'll participate
in the Transcendent Trial.

571
00:27:49,851 --> 00:27:51,452
Why do you have to be such a copycat?

572
00:27:52,011 --> 00:27:52,972
If you can go,

573
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:54,331
I can definitely go too.

574
00:27:54,331 --> 00:27:55,132
Right?

575
00:28:06,331 --> 00:28:07,412
Qingshi.

576
00:28:08,811 --> 00:28:10,371
Why is he here?

577
00:28:24,771 --> 00:28:25,571
Rong,

578
00:28:25,811 --> 00:28:26,932
why are you here?

579
00:28:27,492 --> 00:28:28,611
I'm sorry.

580
00:28:30,371 --> 00:28:31,452
I'll help you up.

581
00:28:34,091 --> 00:28:36,212
I came to the mountain to catch rabbits,

582
00:28:36,331 --> 00:28:37,732
but I didn't expect to see

583
00:28:37,732 --> 00:28:39,452
such a big rabbit.

584
00:28:39,732 --> 00:28:40,371
Rong,

585
00:28:40,652 --> 00:28:41,611
you want rabbits?

586
00:28:41,692 --> 00:28:42,771
That's easy.

587
00:28:43,452 --> 00:28:44,531
I'll help you catch one,

588
00:28:45,091 --> 00:28:45,932
or two,

589
00:28:46,932 --> 00:28:48,452
or three, four, five.

590
00:28:50,571 --> 00:28:51,611
By the way, Qingshi,

591
00:28:51,932 --> 00:28:53,212
why are you here?

592
00:28:53,811 --> 00:28:54,932
The nightmare I had last night

593
00:28:54,932 --> 00:28:56,212
was too real.

594
00:28:56,492 --> 00:28:58,091
So I've been worried

595
00:28:58,652 --> 00:29:00,252
and wanted to come here and take a look.

596
00:29:01,091 --> 00:29:02,011
(It seems)

597
00:29:02,252 --> 00:29:02,892
(I must find a way)

598
00:29:02,892 --> 00:29:04,132
(to get Qingshi away.)

599
00:29:05,172 --> 00:29:05,892
Rong,

600
00:29:07,331 --> 00:29:07,851
Rong.

601
00:29:08,692 --> 00:29:09,571
What?

602
00:29:09,811 --> 00:29:11,051
I have some good news to tell you.

603
00:29:11,412 --> 00:29:12,652
What good news?

604
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:13,732
My brother wrote a letter.

605
00:29:14,172 --> 00:29:14,692
He said

606
00:29:14,692 --> 00:29:16,212
he was going to participate
in the Transcendent Trial.

607
00:29:16,611 --> 00:29:18,051
And Uncle Tong San promised

608
00:29:18,051 --> 00:29:19,771
to take me to Yishui City to watch it.

609
00:29:19,771 --> 00:29:20,611
This way,

610
00:29:20,611 --> 00:29:21,371
I can cheer

611
00:29:21,371 --> 00:29:22,051
for my brother.

612
00:29:22,571 --> 00:29:24,291
You're just going to cheer?

613
00:29:24,571 --> 00:29:25,132
I thought

614
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:26,851
you would participate in it too.

615
00:29:27,132 --> 00:29:28,571
How is that possible, Rong?

616
00:29:28,851 --> 00:29:29,692
With my strength,

617
00:29:29,692 --> 00:29:31,011
I can't beat those people at all.

618
00:29:31,011 --> 00:29:32,051
That's not true.

619
00:29:32,492 --> 00:29:33,492
In my heart,

620
00:29:33,492 --> 00:29:34,611
besides your brother,

621
00:29:34,611 --> 00:29:35,732
you are the best.

622
00:29:36,811 --> 00:29:38,452
Really, Rong?

623
00:29:38,611 --> 00:29:39,692
Am I that great?

624
00:29:39,692 --> 00:29:40,571
Of course.

625
00:29:40,571 --> 00:29:41,412
I don't think

626
00:29:41,412 --> 00:29:43,091
you're worse than your brother.

627
00:29:45,172 --> 00:29:45,811
Rong,

628
00:29:46,412 --> 00:29:47,291
but I...

629
00:29:47,291 --> 00:29:48,492
I really can't do it.

630
00:29:50,371 --> 00:29:51,811
No more wavering.

631
00:29:51,892 --> 00:29:53,252
Even if you can't enter
the Transcendent Realm,

632
00:29:53,252 --> 00:29:54,132
it's okay.

633
00:29:54,132 --> 00:29:55,091
Just take this time

634
00:29:55,091 --> 00:29:57,051
as an opportunity to practice.

635
00:29:57,091 --> 00:29:58,452
Improve your strength

636
00:29:58,851 --> 00:30:00,932
to help your brother
save your mother later.

637
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:02,412
Yes.

638
00:30:04,412 --> 00:30:05,252
I will help my brother

639
00:30:05,611 --> 00:30:06,452
save my mother.

640
00:30:06,932 --> 00:30:08,652
I know you are the best.

641
00:30:10,531 --> 00:30:11,011
Let's go.

642
00:30:11,212 --> 00:30:12,412
Let's catch rabbits together.

643
00:30:12,571 --> 00:30:13,172
Go.

644
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:34,412
Xiaoxi.

645
00:30:41,412 --> 00:30:42,851
How's it, Chi Qiubai?

646
00:30:43,011 --> 00:30:43,932
Do you feel

647
00:30:43,972 --> 00:30:45,371
very powerless?

648
00:30:49,132 --> 00:30:50,851
Actually, saving her

649
00:30:51,571 --> 00:30:53,771
is not entirely impossible.

650
00:30:56,051 --> 00:30:57,132
What do you want?

651
00:30:57,531 --> 00:30:58,412
I want you to give me

652
00:30:58,412 --> 00:30:59,851
what I want.

653
00:31:00,011 --> 00:31:01,811
You want me to betray justice

654
00:31:01,972 --> 00:31:03,091
and betray my friends?

655
00:31:04,771 --> 00:31:06,571
What qualifications
do the Elders of the council

656
00:31:06,571 --> 00:31:08,291
have to represent justice?

657
00:31:08,851 --> 00:31:10,252
You still haven't thought it through,

658
00:31:10,571 --> 00:31:11,571
Chi Qiubai.

659
00:31:11,932 --> 00:31:12,571
Sometimes,

660
00:31:12,692 --> 00:31:13,892
I think

661
00:31:13,892 --> 00:31:15,692
you so-called righteous cultivators

662
00:31:16,011 --> 00:31:17,331
are really interesting

663
00:31:17,531 --> 00:31:18,851
and naive.

664
00:31:19,091 --> 00:31:20,172
In my eyes,

665
00:31:20,732 --> 00:31:22,212
whether it's the Demon Clan,

666
00:31:22,531 --> 00:31:23,291
humans,

667
00:31:23,452 --> 00:31:24,492
beasts

668
00:31:24,851 --> 00:31:27,091
or the six Transcendent organizations,

669
00:31:27,571 --> 00:31:28,692
they are all chasing

670
00:31:29,492 --> 00:31:30,371
after their own self-interest

671
00:31:30,371 --> 00:31:31,811
but have put on different facades.

672
00:31:32,851 --> 00:31:34,611
Do you think our Demon Clan

673
00:31:34,611 --> 00:31:36,611
only fights and kills

674
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,492
and that we don't know

675
00:31:38,492 --> 00:31:40,011
what's right or wrong?

676
00:31:40,291 --> 00:31:41,212
I'm telling you,

677
00:31:42,531 --> 00:31:43,611
I understand

678
00:31:43,611 --> 00:31:44,692
better than all of you.

679
00:31:45,732 --> 00:31:47,172
You and I are

680
00:31:48,051 --> 00:31:50,051
both tools for those in power.

681
00:31:50,291 --> 00:31:51,611
Since we are tools,

682
00:31:52,212 --> 00:31:54,172
how can they say we betray them?

683
00:31:54,571 --> 00:31:55,531
Stop talking nonsense.

684
00:31:56,652 --> 00:31:58,051
What do I have to do

685
00:31:59,291 --> 00:32:00,611
to get Xiaoxi's energy core back?

686
00:32:06,492 --> 00:32:06,972
I want you

687
00:32:06,972 --> 00:32:08,732
to open the barrier on the day

688
00:32:09,252 --> 00:32:10,972
of the Transcendent Battle
of Life and Death.

689
00:32:11,811 --> 00:32:12,771
What do you want to do?

690
00:32:12,972 --> 00:32:14,371
You don't have to be so nervous.

691
00:32:14,972 --> 00:32:16,291
I just want to make

692
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:17,692
the battle

693
00:32:18,011 --> 00:32:19,692
more exciting.

694
00:32:20,972 --> 00:32:22,611
You want those who've newly entered
the Transcendent Realm?

695
00:32:23,252 --> 00:32:24,212
Chi Qiubai,

696
00:32:24,331 --> 00:32:25,972
I advise you not to think too much.

697
00:32:26,132 --> 00:32:27,531
The more you know,

698
00:32:27,531 --> 00:32:29,412
the more guilty you'll feel.

699
00:32:29,732 --> 00:32:30,972
You just need

700
00:32:31,011 --> 00:32:32,132
to simply be a guide

701
00:32:32,452 --> 00:32:33,732
and lead us in.

702
00:32:34,172 --> 00:32:35,212
The rest

703
00:32:35,212 --> 00:32:36,452
doesn't need your involvement.

704
00:32:37,412 --> 00:32:39,051
Even if it's revealed later,

705
00:32:39,051 --> 00:32:40,291
you'll still be

706
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:41,371
the righteous Knight Changfeng,

707
00:32:41,371 --> 00:32:42,212
just someone

708
00:32:42,212 --> 00:32:44,452
with but a tiny oversight.

709
00:32:45,212 --> 00:32:46,371
Isn't that good?

710
00:32:49,851 --> 00:32:51,531
You and those Elders

711
00:32:51,771 --> 00:32:53,412
just want to shirk responsibility

712
00:32:53,531 --> 00:32:55,972
and then boast
about morality and benevolence.

713
00:32:56,932 --> 00:32:58,051
Otherwise,

714
00:32:58,291 --> 00:32:58,892
how could Bu Xiaoxi

715
00:32:58,892 --> 00:33:00,371
end up here?

716
00:33:06,331 --> 00:33:08,091
Just do a simple task

717
00:33:08,452 --> 00:33:10,371
and you'll exchange
for Xiaoxi's energy core.

718
00:33:10,692 --> 00:33:12,051
In this deal,

719
00:33:12,571 --> 00:33:14,972
you'll definitely not lose out.

720
00:33:17,531 --> 00:33:18,091
(Perhaps)

721
00:33:18,091 --> 00:33:18,851
(this is an opportunity)

722
00:33:18,851 --> 00:33:21,091
(to infiltrate the Demon Clan.)

723
00:33:23,011 --> 00:33:24,291
Can you guarantee

724
00:33:26,412 --> 00:33:27,892
not to hurt anyone?

725
00:33:32,492 --> 00:33:33,291
Of course.

726
00:33:49,972 --> 00:33:50,732
Uncle Tong San,

727
00:33:50,851 --> 00:33:51,771
there're so many people in Yishui City.

728
00:33:51,972 --> 00:33:53,652
It's way more than I ever imagined.

729
00:33:53,811 --> 00:33:54,892
Probably half of the residents

730
00:33:54,892 --> 00:33:55,531
of the city are here.

731
00:33:55,611 --> 00:33:56,652
After all, a Transcendent Knight

732
00:33:56,732 --> 00:33:57,331
is not someone

733
00:33:57,331 --> 00:33:58,132
you can see at any time,

734
00:33:59,051 --> 00:34:00,571
let alone so many Transcendent Knights.

735
00:34:00,732 --> 00:34:01,132
Look.

736
00:34:03,851 --> 00:34:04,492
Qingshi,

737
00:34:04,771 --> 00:34:06,011
these are Transcendent Knights.

738
00:34:07,051 --> 00:34:07,371
In the future,

739
00:34:07,371 --> 00:34:08,612
you will become one of them.

740
00:34:08,612 --> 00:34:09,811
I will.

741
00:34:15,331 --> 00:34:16,092
Uncle Tong San.

742
00:34:32,132 --> 00:34:33,291
Who are you?

743
00:34:33,291 --> 00:34:34,252
I'm Cui Yong,

744
00:34:34,371 --> 00:34:35,732
a senior disciple of Changfeng Academy.

745
00:34:39,012 --> 00:34:40,132
Senior disciple of Changfeng Academy,

746
00:34:40,252 --> 00:34:41,092
please spare me.

747
00:34:41,092 --> 00:34:41,491
(This person)

748
00:34:41,652 --> 00:34:42,931
(is my brother's senior.)

749
00:34:43,572 --> 00:34:44,572
(He's really amazing.)

750
00:34:44,572 --> 00:34:45,971
We are all cultivators.

751
00:34:46,172 --> 00:34:47,291
You need

752
00:34:47,291 --> 00:34:48,811
to focus on cultivation.

753
00:34:49,012 --> 00:34:50,331
Stop wasting your time

754
00:34:50,331 --> 00:34:51,331
with mindless violence.

755
00:34:51,971 --> 00:34:52,771
Yes, yes.

756
00:34:52,771 --> 00:34:54,172
I won't do it again.

757
00:34:54,652 --> 00:34:55,771
I won't make things difficult for you.

758
00:34:56,132 --> 00:34:56,612
But,

759
00:34:56,612 --> 00:34:57,771
what are you gonna do

760
00:34:57,771 --> 00:34:58,371
about the person you injured today?

761
00:34:58,411 --> 00:34:59,652
I-I-I'll compensate.

762
00:34:59,652 --> 00:35:01,132
I'll compensate him.

763
00:35:04,971 --> 00:35:05,371
Good.

764
00:35:05,771 --> 00:35:06,652
Senior Cui Yong,

765
00:35:07,371 --> 00:35:09,291
I'm Situ Hong from Changfeng Academy.

766
00:35:10,052 --> 00:35:11,252
During my time at the academy,

767
00:35:11,252 --> 00:35:12,851
I often heard the teachers mention you.

768
00:35:13,052 --> 00:35:13,931
Today,

769
00:35:14,252 --> 00:35:15,891
I saw you being chivalrous.

770
00:35:15,891 --> 00:35:17,572
I'm deeply impressed.

771
00:35:17,891 --> 00:35:18,612
May I have the honor

772
00:35:19,012 --> 00:35:20,212
of inviting you for a cup of tea?

773
00:35:20,891 --> 00:35:21,451
Well...

774
00:35:21,771 --> 00:35:24,331
There are so many things I'm struggling

775
00:35:24,411 --> 00:35:25,532
to understand in my cultivation.

776
00:35:25,971 --> 00:35:26,771
May I

777
00:35:26,771 --> 00:35:28,172
get some guidance from you?

778
00:35:29,331 --> 00:35:29,851
No problem.

779
00:35:30,891 --> 00:35:31,371
Please.

780
00:35:35,491 --> 00:35:36,172
Uncle Tong San,

781
00:35:36,252 --> 00:35:37,612
let's go get something to eat.

782
00:35:38,411 --> 00:35:39,612
I'm hungry as well.

783
00:35:39,612 --> 00:35:40,811
Great, let's go.

784
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:41,572
Let's go.

785
00:35:42,692 --> 00:35:45,092
Fame, no matter how great,
ultimately dissipates

786
00:35:45,291 --> 00:35:47,212
like a passing cloud
in the course of time.

787
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:47,931
Sit, Uncle Tong San.

788
00:35:48,012 --> 00:35:48,771
Today,

789
00:35:48,771 --> 00:35:50,331
I'm going to tell you

790
00:35:50,491 --> 00:35:52,771
about the Transcendent Battle
of Life and Death.

791
00:35:53,291 --> 00:35:54,532
For ages,

792
00:35:54,851 --> 00:35:56,692
becoming Transcendent

793
00:35:57,132 --> 00:35:57,891
has been even more difficult

794
00:35:57,891 --> 00:35:59,811
than making it to the moon.

795
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:02,491
Only a once-in-a-blue-moon genius

796
00:36:02,572 --> 00:36:03,291
with special abilities

797
00:36:03,532 --> 00:36:04,771
can luckily break

798
00:36:05,092 --> 00:36:07,092
through the realm

799
00:36:07,092 --> 00:36:08,092
with special circumstances

800
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:11,371
and opportunities.

801
00:36:12,371 --> 00:36:13,052
But,

802
00:36:13,652 --> 00:36:16,172
there are always people
who can change history

803
00:36:16,172 --> 00:36:17,612
and create miracles.

804
00:36:20,012 --> 00:36:21,371
What an exaggeration.

805
00:36:23,612 --> 00:36:25,532
Ordinary people tend
to see the Transcendent Trial

806
00:36:25,532 --> 00:36:27,771
as having some shine or glow,

807
00:36:27,771 --> 00:36:28,692
but they don't know

808
00:36:28,971 --> 00:36:30,371
the path of cultivation

809
00:36:30,612 --> 00:36:32,252
is full of thorns and hardships.

810
00:36:32,371 --> 00:36:33,172
Isn't it?

811
00:36:33,411 --> 00:36:34,331
Over the years,

812
00:36:34,371 --> 00:36:35,371
how many people

813
00:36:36,012 --> 00:36:37,612
have passed the Transcendent Battle
of Life and Death?

814
00:36:37,811 --> 00:36:39,052
I wasn't sure in the past years,

815
00:36:39,132 --> 00:36:40,012
but this year,

816
00:36:40,451 --> 00:36:41,411
Mr. Cui,

817
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:43,491
I'm sure you'll be

818
00:36:44,851 --> 00:36:45,931
one of them.

819
00:36:48,931 --> 00:36:50,172
You're flattering me.

820
00:36:50,652 --> 00:36:52,532
I'm not.

821
00:36:52,652 --> 00:36:54,612
In terms of cultivation, Dou Qi and character,

822
00:36:54,652 --> 00:36:57,931
you are at the top.

823
00:37:01,371 --> 00:37:02,732
You are too modest.

824
00:37:03,012 --> 00:37:05,132
Although you just
entered Changfeng Academy,

825
00:37:05,411 --> 00:37:06,971
you are a talent, too.

826
00:37:07,612 --> 00:37:08,891
All cultivators can participate

827
00:37:09,212 --> 00:37:11,451
in the Transcendent Battle
of Life and Death.

828
00:37:11,692 --> 00:37:13,411
You might as well give it a try.

829
00:37:13,451 --> 00:37:14,692
I feel flattered.

830
00:37:15,012 --> 00:37:16,371
I'm a mediocre cultivator.

831
00:37:16,371 --> 00:37:18,451
Even if I participate in
the Transcendent Trial,

832
00:37:18,451 --> 00:37:19,811
I'll just be there
to pad the participants

833
00:37:19,811 --> 00:37:20,971
and gain some experience.

834
00:37:21,451 --> 00:37:23,291
Speaking of combat experience,

835
00:37:23,532 --> 00:37:25,212
you're the one who should be mentioned.

836
00:37:25,652 --> 00:37:26,612
Over the years,

837
00:37:26,612 --> 00:37:27,371
I've caught a few demons

838
00:37:27,572 --> 00:37:28,851
with our master

839
00:37:29,291 --> 00:37:31,291
and I've accumulated
a lot of experience.

840
00:37:31,652 --> 00:37:32,252
So

841
00:37:32,572 --> 00:37:33,451
I'm here

842
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:34,891
to ask you for advice

843
00:37:35,012 --> 00:37:36,771
on how to hold on

844
00:37:37,052 --> 00:37:38,291
in the Transcendent Trial.

845
00:37:40,092 --> 00:37:40,931
No problem.

846
00:37:41,851 --> 00:37:43,012
Simply put,

847
00:37:43,012 --> 00:37:44,052
whoever passes

848
00:37:44,052 --> 00:37:46,132
the Transcendent Battle
of Life and Death

849
00:37:46,291 --> 00:37:47,851
will become

850
00:37:49,052 --> 00:37:50,851
the new generation
of Transcendent Knights.

851
00:37:50,931 --> 00:37:51,491
- Good.
- Good.

852
00:37:51,572 --> 00:37:52,331
- Good.
- Good.

853
00:37:53,692 --> 00:37:54,331
Interesting.

854
00:37:54,331 --> 00:37:55,931
Sir, so...

855
00:37:55,931 --> 00:37:57,132
who do you think

856
00:37:57,132 --> 00:37:58,771
can pass the trial this year

857
00:37:58,851 --> 00:38:00,092
and become Transcendent?

858
00:38:00,612 --> 00:38:02,811
As the faces of men differ,
so do their capacities.

859
00:38:02,971 --> 00:38:04,971
Those who can participate in the trial

860
00:38:05,411 --> 00:38:08,052
are all extraordinary.

861
00:38:08,331 --> 00:38:09,371
In my opinion,

862
00:38:09,371 --> 00:38:11,212
Cui Yong is the most likely to pass.

863
00:38:11,491 --> 00:38:12,652
He is the right-hand man

864
00:38:12,652 --> 00:38:13,491
of Knight Changfeng.

865
00:38:13,612 --> 00:38:15,252
He must have learned
a lot of techniques.

866
00:38:15,532 --> 00:38:16,532
Otherwise,

867
00:38:16,532 --> 00:38:17,771
how could he become
the top on the Dragon and Tiger List

868
00:38:17,771 --> 00:38:19,451
of Changfeng Academy?

869
00:38:19,491 --> 00:38:20,811
- Yes.
- Yes.

870
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:22,451
I'm backing Xueying.

871
00:38:22,732 --> 00:38:23,811
Dongbo Xueying.

872
00:38:23,811 --> 00:38:25,052
Dongbo Xueying?

873
00:38:26,092 --> 00:38:27,291
Do you mean

874
00:38:27,291 --> 00:38:27,971
the youngest transcendent trialist?

875
00:38:27,971 --> 00:38:28,652
Yes, yes.

876
00:38:28,931 --> 00:38:30,012
How could I forget him?

877
00:38:30,291 --> 00:38:31,451
You're naive.

878
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,411
What does being young mean?

879
00:38:33,652 --> 00:38:36,092
It means he has only practiced

880
00:38:36,811 --> 00:38:38,172
for a short time

881
00:38:38,172 --> 00:38:39,451
and hasn't gained enough in cultivation.

882
00:38:39,451 --> 00:38:40,971
Compared with those

883
00:38:40,971 --> 00:38:41,851
with longer cultivation time,

884
00:38:42,052 --> 00:38:44,451
Dongbo Xueying

885
00:38:44,451 --> 00:38:45,411
is far behind

886
00:38:45,411 --> 00:38:46,371
in experience, level

887
00:38:46,371 --> 00:38:48,012
and so on.

888
00:38:48,212 --> 00:38:49,172
That's not true.

889
00:38:49,451 --> 00:38:50,012
My brother...

890
00:38:50,851 --> 00:38:51,771
Dongbo Xueying

891
00:38:51,771 --> 00:38:53,291
came back alive

892
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:54,092
from the Black Wind Cliff.

893
00:38:54,291 --> 00:38:55,291
Isn't that enough to prove

894
00:38:55,291 --> 00:38:56,212
his strength is strong?

895
00:38:56,212 --> 00:38:57,692
He will definitely become Transcendent.

896
00:38:58,612 --> 00:38:59,931
Maybe he was just lucky

897
00:38:59,931 --> 00:39:02,012
that time.

898
00:39:02,291 --> 00:39:02,851
What other battle achievements

899
00:39:02,851 --> 00:39:04,371
does he have

900
00:39:04,491 --> 00:39:05,652
besides beating

901
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:06,572
Xiang Pangyun?

902
00:39:06,771 --> 00:39:08,132
Compared to Cui Yong,

903
00:39:08,851 --> 00:39:10,411
he's too far behind.

904
00:39:10,411 --> 00:39:11,771
You can't say that about him!

905
00:39:12,092 --> 00:39:12,692
Qingshi.

906
00:39:12,692 --> 00:39:13,652
I'm telling you,

907
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:15,692
don't underestimate Dongbo Xueying.

908
00:39:16,371 --> 00:39:17,451
We'll see.

909
00:39:17,891 --> 00:39:18,532
Shi.

910
00:39:19,612 --> 00:39:20,052
Shi.

911
00:39:20,291 --> 00:39:21,012
Everyone,

912
00:39:21,092 --> 00:39:22,771
calm down.

913
00:39:22,771 --> 00:39:24,172
Let me continue.

914
00:39:25,291 --> 00:39:26,851
Dongbo Xueying

915
00:39:27,291 --> 00:39:28,612
is quite popular.

916
00:39:28,732 --> 00:39:30,252
What a talent at such a tender age!

917
00:39:30,331 --> 00:39:31,692
You might not know.

918
00:39:32,012 --> 00:39:33,132
Dongbo Xueying

919
00:39:33,572 --> 00:39:34,572
is all show

920
00:39:34,851 --> 00:39:36,172
and no go.

921
00:39:37,132 --> 00:39:38,692
I've seen more than once

922
00:39:38,931 --> 00:39:40,811
the dean personally
guiding his martial arts.

923
00:39:41,172 --> 00:39:42,692
Teaching Xueying alone?

924
00:39:43,172 --> 00:39:44,172
It's absolutely true.

925
00:39:44,891 --> 00:39:45,971
I guess

926
00:39:45,971 --> 00:39:47,732
his recent rise in Dou Qi

927
00:39:47,851 --> 00:39:48,732
must be related

928
00:39:49,172 --> 00:39:50,371
