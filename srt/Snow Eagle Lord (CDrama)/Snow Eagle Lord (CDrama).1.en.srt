00:01:47,602 --> 00:01:49,162
(I was born in the Snow Stone Fort.)

(Ever since I can remember,)

23
00:01:51,162 --> 00:01:52,483
(my mother has told me many stories)

24
00:01:52,483 --> 00:01:53,802
(about my ancestors.)

25
00:01:54,242 --> 00:01:56,923
(My father said it is
because of the guardianship)

26
00:01:57,162 --> 00:01:58,682
(of the ancestors
as depicted in those stories)

27
00:01:59,162 --> 00:02:00,962
(that people of today's
Dragon Mountain Empire)

28
00:02:00,962 --> 00:02:02,763
(are able to enjoy happiness and peace.)

29
00:02:03,363 --> 00:02:05,123
(Next, I'll tell the story)

30
00:02:05,283 --> 00:02:07,162
(of my father.)

00:02:14,360 --> 00:02:15,992

Run!

Go!

35
00:02:55,763 --> 00:02:56,883
- Ying!
- Ying!

36
00:02:57,363 --> 00:02:59,603
- Ying!
- Ying!

37
00:03:00,335 --> 00:03:02,008
(Tong San)

38
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:03,789
(Zong Ling)

39
00:03:05,122 --> 00:03:06,643
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong San,

40
00:03:06,722 --> 00:03:07,923
I'm here.

41
00:03:08,002 --> 00:03:09,242
You scared us to death.

42
00:03:09,242 --> 00:03:10,163
- Come down now.
- Come down.

43
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:14,842
How are you? Are you alright?

44
00:03:15,203 --> 00:03:17,122
Uncle Tong San, Uncle Zong,

45
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:17,802
you almost

46
00:03:17,802 --> 00:03:19,443
hurt that deer just now.

47
00:03:19,883 --> 00:03:20,643
Deer?

48
00:03:21,043 --> 00:03:22,203
It's all your fault, Tong San.

49
00:03:22,203 --> 00:03:23,763
How was I supposed to know?

50
00:03:23,962 --> 00:03:24,603
Ying,

51
00:03:25,443 --> 00:03:27,562
now that the deer is saved by you,

52
00:03:27,643 --> 00:03:29,163
we don't have deer meat to eat today.

53
00:03:29,242 --> 00:03:31,043
Well, it's the Lucky Reunion Festival.

54
00:03:31,122 --> 00:03:32,802
Let's go home and have dinner together.

55
00:03:32,883 --> 00:03:33,443
Let's go.

56
00:03:33,842 --> 00:03:36,323
Great, I'll have sweet buns to eat.

57
00:03:37,562 --> 00:03:38,802
- Let's go have dinner.
- This kid.

58
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:47,090
(Dongbo Lie)

59
00:03:51,087 --> 00:03:51,520
(Moyang Yu)

60
00:03:51,522 --> 00:03:52,402
My lady,

61
00:03:53,242 --> 00:03:55,002
you've been busy all afternoon.

62
00:03:56,122 --> 00:03:56,962
You must be tired.

63
00:03:57,242 --> 00:03:58,802
It is the Lucky Reunion Festival today.

64
00:03:58,842 --> 00:03:59,842
Xueying and Qingshi

65
00:03:59,923 --> 00:04:00,643
have been clamoring

66
00:04:00,722 --> 00:04:02,043
to eat sweet buns.

67
00:04:03,323 --> 00:04:04,443
With your help,

68
00:04:04,682 --> 00:04:06,002
how could I feel tired?

69
00:04:06,203 --> 00:04:07,562
When you came over just now,

70
00:04:07,562 --> 00:04:08,883
I smelled the aroma.

71
00:04:09,122 --> 00:04:10,522
Can I have one first?

72
00:04:11,323 --> 00:04:12,242
Okay.

73
00:04:13,083 --> 00:04:13,682
Give me.

74
00:04:16,763 --> 00:04:17,402
Look.

75
00:04:20,443 --> 00:04:21,922
You're skillful, my lady.

76
00:04:22,282 --> 00:04:24,282
You made the figure
of yourself a bit chubby.

77
00:04:25,203 --> 00:04:27,602
The one of Xueying looks so real.

78
00:04:29,282 --> 00:04:30,602
Father, Mother.

79
00:04:31,123 --> 00:04:32,362
Xueying, you're here.

80
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:34,003
Come to me.

81
00:04:34,083 --> 00:04:35,962
If you had come any later,

82
00:04:36,042 --> 00:04:37,803
I would have eaten the bun doll of you.

83
00:04:38,162 --> 00:04:40,282
Mother, you can't play favorites

84
00:04:40,402 --> 00:04:42,443
and give all the good food to my father.

85
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:44,042
You're unhappy about this?

86
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:47,362
Alright, you are our little treasure,

87
00:04:47,482 --> 00:04:49,243
and I'll save all the good food
for you in the future.

88
00:04:49,362 --> 00:04:50,003
Is that okay?

89
00:04:50,883 --> 00:04:51,803
You're happy now.

90
00:04:52,243 --> 00:04:54,243
Tong San, Zong Ling,

91
00:04:55,042 --> 00:04:57,042
looks like you've returned empty-handed.

92
00:04:58,282 --> 00:04:59,042
Actually, Tong San

93
00:04:59,042 --> 00:05:00,243
could have brought back a wild deer.

94
00:05:00,362 --> 00:05:01,722
But the little one

95
00:05:01,962 --> 00:05:03,643
didn't want it dead and he let it go.

96
00:05:04,842 --> 00:05:06,162
It seems

97
00:05:06,203 --> 00:05:07,602
the future Lord of Xueying Territory

98
00:05:08,482 --> 00:05:10,922
is benevolent.

99
00:05:11,083 --> 00:05:12,922
Father, instead of being a lord,

100
00:05:12,922 --> 00:05:15,243
I want my mother's
storage treasure more.

101
00:05:17,402 --> 00:05:18,402
Okay.

102
00:05:18,522 --> 00:05:20,203
When you cultivate Dou Qi,

103
00:05:20,362 --> 00:05:21,602
I will give it to you.

104
00:05:21,602 --> 00:05:22,162
Is that okay?

105
00:05:22,203 --> 00:05:22,522
Okay.

106
00:05:22,522 --> 00:05:23,443
No way.

107
00:05:25,282 --> 00:05:26,323
Come to me.

108
00:05:26,643 --> 00:05:27,643
Go to your father.

109
00:05:29,482 --> 00:05:32,243
When you can pull
the Star Breaking Crossbow,

110
00:05:32,362 --> 00:05:33,362
your mother

111
00:05:33,722 --> 00:05:35,803
will reward you with her treasure.

112
00:05:36,282 --> 00:05:38,203
Father, the Star Breaking Crossbow

113
00:05:38,323 --> 00:05:39,922
(Xueying Territory)
is the most cherished treasure of our territory.

114
00:05:40,083 --> 00:05:40,883
You can only pull the crossbow

115
00:05:40,883 --> 00:05:42,323
with a tremendous force.

116
00:05:42,482 --> 00:05:43,683
So it can shoot an arrow

117
00:05:43,683 --> 00:05:44,643
with unmatched speed

118
00:05:44,842 --> 00:05:46,203
and power.

119
00:05:46,323 --> 00:05:47,922
Whether it's an iron wall

120
00:05:48,162 --> 00:05:49,683
or a small snowflake,

121
00:05:49,883 --> 00:05:50,962
it can be pierced through.

122
00:05:53,003 --> 00:05:54,003
Father, Mother,

123
00:05:54,003 --> 00:05:55,282
you just wait and see.

124
00:05:55,402 --> 00:05:57,083
I will manage to pull
the Star Breaking Crossbow

125
00:05:57,203 --> 00:05:58,763
and protect the Xueying Territory
in the future.

126
00:06:00,883 --> 00:06:03,402
Little Stone, hurry up.
It's time for dinner.

127
00:06:03,803 --> 00:06:05,922
Got it, brother.

128
00:06:13,123 --> 00:06:15,443
It is the Lucky Reunion Festival today.

129
00:06:15,803 --> 00:06:17,083
And it's been ten years

130
00:06:17,083 --> 00:06:18,282
since we came to the Xueying Territory.

131
00:06:18,922 --> 00:06:20,443
Let's raise our cups together,

132
00:06:20,883 --> 00:06:24,042
wishing the territory peace and success.

133
00:06:24,162 --> 00:06:25,443
Happiness.

134
00:06:25,602 --> 00:06:26,922
Fortune in abundance.

135
00:06:27,083 --> 00:06:28,722
And always together.

136
00:06:28,842 --> 00:06:29,443
Cheers.

137
00:06:29,722 --> 00:06:30,362
Come on.

138
00:06:36,482 --> 00:06:38,243
The milk is so delicious.

139
00:06:38,323 --> 00:06:39,203
Is it?

140
00:06:39,203 --> 00:06:40,962
Then drink more.

141
00:06:41,003 --> 00:06:42,203
Xueying,

142
00:06:42,323 --> 00:06:44,443
here is your favorite sweet bun.

143
00:06:44,563 --> 00:06:45,323
Thank you.

144
00:06:59,083 --> 00:06:59,763
I think

145
00:06:59,763 --> 00:07:01,563
I heard a wolf cub calling.

146
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:11,883
Father, it's this one.

147
00:07:12,123 --> 00:07:13,602
I found it

148
00:07:13,602 --> 00:07:14,683
in the snow today.

149
00:07:14,683 --> 00:07:15,842
It looks so cute,

150
00:07:15,962 --> 00:07:17,962
so I brought it back.

151
00:07:18,203 --> 00:07:20,522
Can I keep it as a pet?

152
00:07:20,763 --> 00:07:21,842
No way.

153
00:07:44,282 --> 00:07:46,162
Father, I'm tired.

154
00:07:52,602 --> 00:07:53,282
Father,

155
00:07:53,402 --> 00:07:54,922
why do we have to send the wolf cub

156
00:07:54,922 --> 00:07:55,922
back?

157
00:07:56,123 --> 00:07:58,203
I haven't played enough with it.

158
00:08:00,522 --> 00:08:01,482
If you were separated

159
00:08:02,123 --> 00:08:04,282
from your own parents,

160
00:08:04,402 --> 00:08:05,643
would you feel sad?

161
00:08:05,763 --> 00:08:07,362
But it's not a person.

162
00:08:07,683 --> 00:08:09,563
It's just an animal.

163
00:08:11,162 --> 00:08:12,683
No matter if it's a human or an animal,

164
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:14,722
they are both living beings.

165
00:08:15,522 --> 00:08:17,443
And they both long
for the warmth of a family.

166
00:08:17,763 --> 00:08:19,362
It is the Lucky Reunion Festival today.

167
00:08:20,003 --> 00:08:21,922
You are with your parents,

168
00:08:22,402 --> 00:08:25,482
but you made the wolf cub
leave its parents.

169
00:08:26,482 --> 00:08:28,402
Do you think what you're doing is right?

170
00:08:28,643 --> 00:08:30,243
But if it lives with us

171
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,323
after I brought it back,

172
00:08:32,722 --> 00:08:34,762
doesn't it mean it has a new home?

173
00:08:35,523 --> 00:08:37,083
In the old days,
the Dragon Mountain Emperor

174
00:08:37,443 --> 00:08:40,122
created the Dragon Mountain.

175
00:08:40,642 --> 00:08:41,642
We, the Xia Clan,

176
00:08:41,642 --> 00:08:42,803
do not thrive

177
00:08:42,803 --> 00:08:43,683
through the slaughter

178
00:08:43,803 --> 00:08:45,762
and pillaging of other races.

179
00:08:45,962 --> 00:08:48,523
Great love comes from protection.

180
00:08:48,683 --> 00:08:50,403
Only by protecting the weak

181
00:08:50,762 --> 00:08:52,242
can one fulfill oneself

182
00:08:52,362 --> 00:08:54,083
and gain more supporters.

183
00:08:54,323 --> 00:08:55,283
You'll understand these

184
00:08:55,762 --> 00:08:57,043
in the future.

185
00:08:57,803 --> 00:08:58,523
Let's go.

186
00:09:08,642 --> 00:09:09,923
The Silver Moon Wolf King!

187
00:09:10,043 --> 00:09:11,882
It must be the wolf cub's family,

188
00:09:12,002 --> 00:09:13,362
and it's coming for revenge.

189
00:09:14,923 --> 00:09:16,762
Xueying, don't be afraid.

190
00:09:17,163 --> 00:09:18,482
Give the wolf cub back.

191
00:09:43,043 --> 00:09:45,443
That really scared me just now.

192
00:09:45,563 --> 00:09:46,642
If the Silver Moon Wolf King

193
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:47,722
had really rushed up,

194
00:09:47,882 --> 00:09:48,962
we'd have become

195
00:09:48,962 --> 00:09:50,642
its Lucky Reunion Festival dinner.

196
00:09:52,283 --> 00:09:54,362
Don't be afraid. I'm with you.

197
00:09:54,362 --> 00:09:56,568
(Xueying Territory)

198
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:01,523
Little Stone,

199
00:10:01,563 --> 00:10:02,923
you came up here too?

200
00:10:03,043 --> 00:10:05,122
Brother, what are you looking at?

201
00:10:05,203 --> 00:10:08,002
This book is called
"The Ten Transcendent Knights",

202
00:10:08,122 --> 00:10:09,563
and it's about how those people

203
00:10:09,563 --> 00:10:11,083
became Transcendent Knights

204
00:10:11,083 --> 00:10:12,923
through practice.

205
00:10:13,083 --> 00:10:14,043
Is it interesting?

206
00:10:14,043 --> 00:10:15,242
Of course, it's interesting.

207
00:10:15,283 --> 00:10:16,762
Through countless hours

208
00:10:16,882 --> 00:10:18,482
of practice,

209
00:10:18,602 --> 00:10:19,602
those ordinary lives

210
00:10:19,722 --> 00:10:21,203
finally transformed

211
00:10:21,323 --> 00:10:23,283
into Transcendent Heroes.

212
00:10:23,443 --> 00:10:24,762
What does "Transcendent" mean?

213
00:10:24,882 --> 00:10:25,842
It is an extremely high level

214
00:10:25,962 --> 00:10:27,882
of cultivation.

215
00:10:28,043 --> 00:10:29,882
First of all, you need to have Dou Qi

216
00:10:30,002 --> 00:10:32,203
and practice to become a Mortal Knight.

217
00:10:32,323 --> 00:10:34,362
But the Dou Qi of a Mortal Knight

218
00:10:34,482 --> 00:10:35,563
cannot be condensed.

219
00:10:35,683 --> 00:10:38,083
When the knight
reaches the Meteor Level,

220
00:10:38,203 --> 00:10:39,563
his Dou Qi can transform

221
00:10:39,683 --> 00:10:41,242
into a specific form.

222
00:10:41,722 --> 00:10:43,122
First, Mortal Knights go

223
00:10:43,283 --> 00:10:45,323
through the Human, Earth,

224
00:10:45,443 --> 00:10:47,122
and Heaven Levels.

225
00:10:47,283 --> 00:10:49,362
Later, they continue
to reach the Meteor,

226
00:10:49,403 --> 00:10:50,923
Silver Moon, and Legend Levels

227
00:10:50,923 --> 00:10:52,083
as the Star Knights.

228
00:10:52,122 --> 00:10:54,443
The power of their Dou Qi
becomes stronger and stronger.

229
00:10:54,563 --> 00:10:55,842
Once they step
into the Transcendent Realm,

230
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:56,403
that's a leap

231
00:10:56,403 --> 00:10:58,762
in the entire level of life.

232
00:10:58,882 --> 00:11:00,882
Aren't Transcendent Knights humans?

233
00:11:01,002 --> 00:11:01,923
The knights with Transcendent Dou Qi

234
00:11:01,923 --> 00:11:03,722
can harness the power
of heaven and earth

235
00:11:03,722 --> 00:11:06,842
and integrate with the mysteries
of the universe.

236
00:11:07,002 --> 00:11:07,882
(Transcendent)
People wielding ordinary weapons

237
00:11:07,882 --> 00:11:09,563
(Transcendent)
can't hurt them at all.

238
00:11:09,683 --> 00:11:10,923
(Transcendent)
So powerful.

239
00:11:11,043 --> 00:11:13,203
But very few people in our entire empire

240
00:11:13,203 --> 00:11:15,722
can enter the Transcendent Realm.

241
00:11:15,962 --> 00:11:17,482
What about our father?

242
00:11:17,523 --> 00:11:19,043
Our father is still at the Meteor Level.

243
00:11:19,043 --> 00:11:21,523
With more practice,
he'll become a Silver Moon Knight.

244
00:11:21,923 --> 00:11:22,482
Brother,

245
00:11:22,482 --> 00:11:24,602
will you become
a Transcendent Knight in the future?

246
00:11:24,722 --> 00:11:25,602
Of course.

247
00:11:25,722 --> 00:11:26,842
After we

248
00:11:26,842 --> 00:11:28,083
become Transcendent Heroes

249
00:11:28,083 --> 00:11:29,482
with super powers,

250
00:11:29,602 --> 00:11:31,002
we'll protect our parents

251
00:11:31,002 --> 00:11:32,242
and our territory.

252
00:11:38,882 --> 00:11:40,163
Light's out.

253
00:11:40,323 --> 00:11:41,403
Brother,

254
00:11:41,403 --> 00:11:44,762
I haven't heard enough of the stories.

255
00:11:45,403 --> 00:11:47,163
That's just what happens

256
00:11:47,163 --> 00:11:48,083
when your mother is a mage.

257
00:11:48,083 --> 00:11:50,362
When it's time,
the lights will go out automatically.

258
00:11:50,482 --> 00:11:52,163
Let's go back to the room to sleep.

259
00:11:52,163 --> 00:11:53,642
I'll tell you more when I have time.

260
00:12:12,842 --> 00:12:13,602
Lie.

261
00:12:14,362 --> 00:12:16,203
Yu, don't be afraid.

262
00:12:17,602 --> 00:12:18,403
I'm here.

263
00:12:28,803 --> 00:12:29,923
I'll go check on the children.

264
00:12:54,607 --> 00:12:58,004
(Thundering Gust)

265
00:13:03,523 --> 00:13:04,762
Who's there?

266
00:13:17,715 --> 00:13:20,035
(Ferocious Spearstrike)

267
00:13:38,882 --> 00:13:39,602
Xueying.

268
00:13:41,523 --> 00:13:43,642
Mother, what's up?

269
00:13:45,482 --> 00:13:47,002
I have something for you.

270
00:13:55,043 --> 00:13:55,882
Mother,

271
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,283
isn't this your storage treasure?

272
00:13:58,443 --> 00:13:59,323
Why?

273
00:13:59,443 --> 00:14:00,563
From today on,

274
00:14:00,962 --> 00:14:02,163
it belongs to you.

275
00:14:02,443 --> 00:14:04,043
Give me your hand.

276
00:14:23,203 --> 00:14:24,083
Mother,

277
00:14:24,083 --> 00:14:24,842
why are you

278
00:14:24,842 --> 00:14:27,242
suddenly giving it to me?

279
00:14:28,043 --> 00:14:29,283
Because then

280
00:14:29,523 --> 00:14:31,043
you can keep

281
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,443
all your treasures

282
00:14:32,602 --> 00:14:33,882
inside it.

283
00:14:34,523 --> 00:14:36,002
You must keep it well.

284
00:14:36,163 --> 00:14:37,563
When you meet someone in the future,

285
00:14:37,602 --> 00:14:38,403
it may unleash

286
00:14:38,403 --> 00:14:39,803
incredible power.

287
00:14:55,043 --> 00:14:56,403
Mother, what's that sound?

288
00:14:56,443 --> 00:14:56,882
Mother.

289
00:14:56,882 --> 00:14:57,722
- Mother.
- Don't be afraid.

290
00:14:57,722 --> 00:14:59,083
There, there, Qingshi.

291
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,242
Come to me.

292
00:15:00,523 --> 00:15:01,083
- Mother.
- It's alright.

293
00:15:01,083 --> 00:15:02,563
Good boys.

294
00:15:02,563 --> 00:15:04,163
I'm here. Don't be afraid.

295
00:15:10,882 --> 00:15:12,043
Wait here for me.

296
00:15:12,323 --> 00:15:13,563
I'll be right back.

297
00:15:16,403 --> 00:15:19,043
Mother! I want Mother!

298
00:15:19,882 --> 00:15:20,602
Qingshi.

299
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,163
Mother.

300
00:15:25,722 --> 00:15:27,403
Where is Moyang Yu?

301
00:15:48,111 --> 00:15:49,080
(Moyang Chen)

302
00:15:49,443 --> 00:15:50,523
Moyang Chen.

303
00:15:53,242 --> 00:15:53,923
(Tong San,)

304
00:15:54,083 --> 00:15:55,482
(take away Xueying
and Qingshi right now.)

305
00:15:55,923 --> 00:15:57,283
(I entrust them to you.)

306
00:15:57,443 --> 00:15:58,122
Well...

307
00:16:00,882 --> 00:16:02,203
After all these years,

308
00:16:02,403 --> 00:16:04,043
I've finally found you.

309
00:16:04,362 --> 00:16:05,122
Moyang Chen,

310
00:16:05,722 --> 00:16:06,842
what do you want to do?

311
00:16:07,242 --> 00:16:10,242
Back then, you broke
the arranged marriage

312
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,563
and eloped with someone,

313
00:16:12,002 --> 00:16:14,203
bringing huge shame on our family.

314
00:16:14,443 --> 00:16:16,882
Bringing you back
is my responsibility as your brother.

315
00:16:17,122 --> 00:16:17,882
I don't think

316
00:16:18,283 --> 00:16:20,283
it's the family's request.

317
00:16:20,602 --> 00:16:22,323
It's you who have ulterior motives.

318
00:16:22,962 --> 00:16:25,203
You have to come with me today.

319
00:16:25,362 --> 00:16:26,362
Don't blindly pursue

320
00:16:26,362 --> 00:16:28,002
martial arts prowess

321
00:16:28,203 --> 00:16:29,362
and lose your mind.

322
00:16:29,683 --> 00:16:30,882
I really hate this kind

323
00:16:30,882 --> 00:16:32,642
of didactic tone.

324
00:16:33,002 --> 00:16:33,962
Are you going

325
00:16:33,962 --> 00:16:35,122
to use your Ancient Bloodline

326
00:16:35,122 --> 00:16:36,403
to deal with me?

327
00:16:36,803 --> 00:16:38,762
I heard that great battle

328
00:16:38,962 --> 00:16:40,283
almost exhausted

329
00:16:40,283 --> 00:16:41,722
the strength

330
00:16:41,962 --> 00:16:44,002
of your Ancient Bloodline.

331
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:45,283
Otherwise,

332
00:16:45,283 --> 00:16:46,242
you wouldn't have hidden here.

333
00:16:46,602 --> 00:16:47,882
Let's see

334
00:16:47,962 --> 00:16:50,043
who can help you today.

335
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:52,083
As long as I have a breath left,

336
00:16:52,362 --> 00:16:54,122
no one can take her away.

337
00:16:54,203 --> 00:16:54,842
Lie,

338
00:16:55,563 --> 00:16:56,762
no need to talk to him.

339
00:17:02,203 --> 00:17:03,523
Ying, where are you going?

340
00:17:03,523 --> 00:17:04,642
- Let go of me.
- Where are you going?

341
00:17:05,402 --> 00:17:06,682
It's dangerous outside. Stop it.

342
00:17:06,682 --> 00:17:08,362
Little Stone
is still crying in the room.

343
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:11,563
Ying.

344
00:18:18,963 --> 00:18:19,963
Mother.

345
00:18:43,362 --> 00:18:44,122
Xueying.

346
00:18:59,663 --> 00:19:01,108
(Thundering Strike)

347
00:19:09,803 --> 00:19:10,362
Xueying.

348
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,323
Xueying.

349
00:19:13,083 --> 00:19:13,922
Xueying.

350
00:19:16,523 --> 00:19:17,323
Xueying.

351
00:19:20,642 --> 00:19:21,202
Mother.

352
00:19:21,202 --> 00:19:21,642
Xueying.

353
00:19:21,642 --> 00:19:22,922
Did I kill that bad guy?

354
00:19:22,922 --> 00:19:23,642
Xueying,

355
00:19:24,003 --> 00:19:25,003
are you alright?

356
00:19:25,842 --> 00:19:27,803
Let me take a look.

357
00:19:28,563 --> 00:19:29,682
My silly child.

358
00:19:29,682 --> 00:19:32,283
Mother, did I kill that bad guy?

359
00:19:32,362 --> 00:19:33,803
You almost scared me to death.

360
00:19:34,162 --> 00:19:35,642
This child

361
00:19:35,803 --> 00:19:37,682
is your son, right?

362
00:19:39,323 --> 00:19:41,083
The little guy

363
00:19:41,202 --> 00:19:43,402
has the Ancient Bloodline too, right?

364
00:19:48,362 --> 00:19:49,362
Father.

365
00:19:52,763 --> 00:19:53,723
Xueying,

366
00:19:55,803 --> 00:19:57,402
take good care of your mother.

367
00:19:58,763 --> 00:19:59,642
Lie.

368
00:20:07,162 --> 00:20:09,602
Lie, let go, Lie.

369
00:20:11,362 --> 00:20:12,763
Lie.

370
00:20:38,602 --> 00:20:42,323
Lie, let go!

371
00:20:45,323 --> 00:20:46,362
Father.

372
00:20:47,043 --> 00:20:48,442
Father.

373
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:54,842
Lord.

374
00:20:58,362 --> 00:20:59,763
Come with me.

375
00:21:00,162 --> 00:21:02,362
No one can take my mother away.

376
00:21:02,642 --> 00:21:03,763
If you don't,

377
00:21:04,243 --> 00:21:06,483
the people
of the entire Xueying Territory

378
00:21:06,483 --> 00:21:07,963
will be buried with you.

379
00:21:09,243 --> 00:21:12,323
Let's start with your son.

380
00:21:12,882 --> 00:21:14,563
(Moyang Chen is already
at the Silver Moon Level.)

381
00:21:14,602 --> 00:21:17,243
(Destroying the territory would be
but a piece of cake for him.)

382
00:21:17,682 --> 00:21:18,803
Don't hurt him.

383
00:21:21,963 --> 00:21:23,122
I'll go with you.

384
00:21:27,083 --> 00:21:28,842
Xueying, promise me

385
00:21:29,243 --> 00:21:30,483
you'll take care of yourself

386
00:21:31,323 --> 00:21:32,963
and your younger brother

387
00:21:33,682 --> 00:21:34,442
when your father and I are not around.

388
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:36,682
Did you hear me? Tell me.

389
00:21:36,682 --> 00:21:37,963
Yes, I did.

390
00:21:43,922 --> 00:21:46,083
Mother, Mother.

391
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:52,323
Mother, Mother.

392
00:21:53,083 --> 00:21:56,362
Mother, Mother.

393
00:21:59,243 --> 00:22:01,323
Mother!

394
00:22:26,489 --> 00:22:33,592
(Xueying Territory)

395
00:22:39,243 --> 00:22:40,882
(Moyang Chen killed my father)

396
00:22:40,963 --> 00:22:42,043
(and took my mother away.)

397
00:22:42,243 --> 00:22:43,682
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)
(Please help me kill him.)

398
00:22:43,922 --> 00:22:45,523
(Only those who possess
the Black Iron Order)

399
00:22:45,682 --> 00:22:47,642
(can ask Dragon Mountain Mansion
to do something for them.)

400
00:22:47,803 --> 00:22:48,483
(I'm afraid)

401
00:22:48,483 --> 00:22:50,202
(you don't even have Dou Qi now, right?)

402
00:22:50,442 --> 00:22:52,642
(You'd better go back.)

403
00:22:52,650 --> 00:22:54,940
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

404
00:23:04,687 --> 00:23:06,892
(Ten years later)

405
00:23:16,911 --> 00:23:18,858
(Dongbo Xueying)

406
00:23:25,417 --> 00:23:26,328
(Blessings and Auspices)

407
00:23:41,233 --> 00:23:43,800
(Dark Ice Spear Technique: Flying Snow)

408
00:23:53,323 --> 00:23:54,922
Ying, eat first.

409
00:23:55,122 --> 00:23:56,122
Stop practicing and take a break.

410
00:24:04,362 --> 00:24:05,283
(Strong.)

411
00:24:05,642 --> 00:24:07,043
(I need to become stronger.)

412
00:24:17,602 --> 00:24:19,083
Good spear technique, Ying.

413
00:24:19,523 --> 00:24:20,483
Nice.

414
00:24:20,723 --> 00:24:22,202
Good spear technique, Ying.

415
00:24:22,563 --> 00:24:23,602
It's been ten years,

416
00:24:23,763 --> 00:24:25,083
but I haven't even cultivated Dou Qi.

417
00:24:25,523 --> 00:24:26,682
Moyang Chen must be stronger than he was

418
00:24:26,682 --> 00:24:27,283
ten years ago.

419
00:24:27,602 --> 00:24:28,642
But I am not even

420
00:24:28,642 --> 00:24:29,323
a Mortal Knight.

421
00:24:29,803 --> 00:24:30,803
I'm really useless.

422
00:24:30,842 --> 00:24:31,563
Ying,

423
00:24:31,842 --> 00:24:33,723
you practice thousands of times a day.

424
00:24:33,882 --> 00:24:35,483
You've managed to harness immense force

425
00:24:35,483 --> 00:24:36,602
from the elementary technique,
Soul Spear.

426
00:24:36,602 --> 00:24:37,642
It's no mean feat.

427
00:24:37,803 --> 00:24:39,323
Don't push yourself too hard.

428
00:24:39,483 --> 00:24:40,323
Given time,

429
00:24:40,523 --> 00:24:42,122
you'll definitely surpass Moyang Chen.

430
00:24:42,243 --> 00:24:43,362
Yeah, Ying.

431
00:24:43,842 --> 00:24:44,202
I just hope

432
00:24:44,362 --> 00:24:45,523
that day comes sooner.

433
00:24:45,642 --> 00:24:46,842
Then I will rescue my mother.

434
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,523
Let's eat.

435
00:24:52,323 --> 00:24:53,882
Alright, let's eat.

436
00:25:00,362 --> 00:25:01,003
Smells good.

437
00:25:03,523 --> 00:25:04,723
Eat more.

438
00:25:10,563 --> 00:25:11,362
Ying.

439
00:25:14,602 --> 00:25:15,243
Spit it out.

440
00:25:17,043 --> 00:25:18,043
Ying,

441
00:25:18,763 --> 00:25:20,003
eat slowly.

442
00:25:21,963 --> 00:25:23,402
I haven't cultivated Dou Qi yet.

443
00:25:24,362 --> 00:25:25,963
How do I increase
my strength without eating a lot?

444
00:25:26,122 --> 00:25:27,922
How do I keep practicing
without enough strength?

445
00:25:28,402 --> 00:25:30,003
Just don't stuff yourself too much.

446
00:25:30,162 --> 00:25:30,803
It's okay.

447
00:25:31,283 --> 00:25:32,763
I'll practice two thousand more times,
and it'll be fine.

448
00:25:41,763 --> 00:25:42,723
Our lady has been missing

449
00:25:42,723 --> 00:25:43,882
for so many years.

450
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:45,602
With only a few unconfirmed leads,

451
00:25:45,723 --> 00:25:47,003
Ying wouldn't let any of them slip by.

452
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:49,483
Logically, the Dragon Mountain Mansion

453
00:25:49,602 --> 00:25:51,162
is the only one
with any accurate information.

454
00:25:51,323 --> 00:25:52,882
But they're unwilling to help.

455
00:25:53,162 --> 00:25:54,842
We can only negotiate
with them on equal terms

456
00:25:55,003 --> 00:25:56,602
once we have the Black Iron Order.

457
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,122
Snobbish.

458
00:25:59,323 --> 00:26:00,842
That's the way this world is.

459
00:26:00,922 --> 00:26:02,682
Whoever is powerful has the say

460
00:26:02,803 --> 00:26:03,803
and can even

461
00:26:04,642 --> 00:26:05,803
set the rules.

462
00:26:09,003 --> 00:26:10,283
Uncle Tong San, Uncle Zong Ling,

463
00:26:10,442 --> 00:26:11,362
come and practice with me.

464
00:26:11,523 --> 00:26:12,682
Still practicing?

465
00:26:13,283 --> 00:26:13,882
You go.

466
00:26:13,882 --> 00:26:14,402
He's asking for you.

467
00:26:14,402 --> 00:26:15,043
You go.

468
00:26:15,043 --> 00:26:15,723
He's asking for you.

469
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:16,442
Go, go.

470
00:26:25,122 --> 00:26:26,122
Look at him.

471
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:41,208
(Weapon Shop)

472
00:26:56,523 --> 00:26:57,563
Lord Si An,

473
00:26:57,803 --> 00:26:59,402
recently, the demons' attacks

474
00:26:59,563 --> 00:27:00,803
have caused panic among the people.

475
00:27:01,202 --> 00:27:02,602
What are your thoughts, Sir?

476
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:04,323
What about you?

477
00:27:04,483 --> 00:27:05,362
Demons

478
00:27:05,523 --> 00:27:07,323
are far from ordinary bandits

479
00:27:07,483 --> 00:27:08,642
and are extremely ferocious.

480
00:27:08,803 --> 00:27:11,323
Some say it's comparable
to a Transcendent Knight.

481
00:27:11,442 --> 00:27:12,523
Transcendent?

482
00:27:12,642 --> 00:27:13,323
They might be

483
00:27:13,323 --> 00:27:15,243
underestimating a Transcendent Knight.

484
00:27:21,602 --> 00:27:22,723
(The Water Daoist Temple)

485
00:27:23,003 --> 00:27:24,043
(is the faction
with the most Transcendent Knights)

486
00:27:24,202 --> 00:27:25,642
(Water Daoist Temple)
(in the entire Dragon Mountain Empire.)

487
00:27:26,243 --> 00:27:27,483
(Master Sikong Yang)

488
00:27:27,642 --> 00:27:29,842
(has formed Deity Heart.)

489
00:27:29,842 --> 00:27:30,481
(Sikong Yang)

490
00:27:30,483 --> 00:27:32,682
(He's considered a Demigod.)

491
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:34,442
(Not only does he have
superb martial arts,)

492
00:27:34,563 --> 00:27:36,523
(he's also good at recognizing)

493
00:27:36,682 --> 00:27:37,602
(and using talents.)

494
00:27:38,202 --> 00:27:40,602
(The Black White Deity Mountain
is skilled in formation spells.)

495
00:27:40,842 --> 00:27:42,763
(Master He was once recognized)

496
00:27:42,763 --> 00:27:44,162
(Master He)
(as the number one martial artist in the world.)

497
00:27:44,442 --> 00:27:46,083
(His Black White Moon alone)

498
00:27:46,243 --> 00:27:47,483
(has made him famous all around.)

499
00:27:48,523 --> 00:27:49,723
(The Temple of the Earth God)

500
00:27:49,922 --> 00:27:51,602
(focuses on studying
divine mystic spells.)

501
00:27:51,882 --> 00:27:53,043
(Master Xi Yun)

502
00:27:53,202 --> 00:27:55,202
(is easygoing and never offends anyone.)

503
00:27:55,402 --> 00:27:56,682
(Xi Yun)
(But he gives no quarter)

504
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:58,442
(when fighting others.)

505
00:27:59,043 --> 00:28:00,642
(The sisters in the Fog City,)

506
00:28:00,803 --> 00:28:01,922
(though gentle in nature,)

507
00:28:02,122 --> 00:28:03,563
(have strong martial arts.)

508
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:04,602
(Bu Xiaoxi) (Bu Chunyuan)
(They wholeheartedly protect)

509
00:28:04,602 --> 00:28:06,083
(the people of their city.)

510
00:28:06,602 --> 00:28:08,563
(The Sea God Palace
is the farthest from here,)

511
00:28:08,723 --> 00:28:10,563
(with the poorest resources
for cultivation.)

512
00:28:10,842 --> 00:28:12,922
(No wonder the Master Tai Shu)

513
00:28:12,922 --> 00:28:14,003
(has a bad temper.)

514
00:28:14,523 --> 00:28:15,323
(However,)

515
00:28:15,483 --> 00:28:17,243
(he's not reckless or aggressive.)

516
00:28:17,483 --> 00:28:18,922
(Master Tai Shu)
(He merely wants to cultivate)

517
00:28:19,083 --> 00:28:20,682
(Bloodshed Tavern)
(a few Transcendent Knights.)

518
00:28:21,243 --> 00:28:23,003
(Bloodshed Tavern)
(As for the Bloodshed Tavern,)

519
00:28:23,202 --> 00:28:25,162
(Ye Mei has always been a loner.)

520
00:28:25,323 --> 00:28:26,323
(She has long ceased getting involved)

521
00:28:26,442 --> 00:28:27,963
(in the council's affairs.)

522
00:28:27,963 --> 00:28:28,920
(Ye Mei)

523
00:28:28,922 --> 00:28:31,083
(They are all powerful forces.)

524
00:28:31,283 --> 00:28:32,963
Which organization do you think

525
00:28:33,122 --> 00:28:34,323
is related to the demons?

526
00:28:34,323 --> 00:28:35,442
Could it be the Demon God Association?

527
00:28:35,442 --> 00:28:37,001
(Si An)

528
00:28:37,003 --> 00:28:38,563
I have the same concern.

529
00:28:39,323 --> 00:28:40,602
20 years ago,

530
00:28:40,803 --> 00:28:42,563
during the great war
between the Xia Clan and the Demon Clan,

531
00:28:43,323 --> 00:28:44,202
it took the power
of the entire Dragon Mountain Empire

532
00:28:44,362 --> 00:28:45,763
to repel the Demon Clan.

533
00:28:45,922 --> 00:28:48,523
However, the Great Demon God
was only sealed,

534
00:28:48,523 --> 00:28:50,043
and the Demon Clan was not wiped out.

535
00:28:51,043 --> 00:28:53,362
(You Tu)
Back then, the Six Great Elders sealed him together.

536
00:28:53,483 --> 00:28:54,803
Even if the Demon God Association
has bad intentions,

537
00:28:54,882 --> 00:28:55,803
what can

538
00:28:55,803 --> 00:28:56,842
those low-level demons do?

539
00:28:56,922 --> 00:28:58,202
We, the Dragon Mountain Mansion,

540
00:28:58,602 --> 00:28:59,682
only care about intelligence.

541
00:28:59,963 --> 00:29:01,122
As for the rest,

542
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,483
we'll wait and see.

543
00:29:10,243 --> 00:29:11,043
Ying,

544
00:29:11,323 --> 00:29:12,043
during this time,

545
00:29:12,043 --> 00:29:13,202
you've broken so many spears.

546
00:29:13,283 --> 00:29:15,003
Let's go to the town and buy a good one.

547
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:26,442
Hello?

548
00:29:27,283 --> 00:29:28,323
Customers are here!

549
00:29:29,323 --> 00:29:31,083
What would you two like to buy?

550
00:29:34,563 --> 00:29:36,283
Good taste, Sir.

551
00:29:36,442 --> 00:29:37,243
This is

552
00:29:37,362 --> 00:29:38,763
a third-level alchemy weapon.

553
00:29:38,882 --> 00:29:40,362
It can even handle

554
00:29:40,563 --> 00:29:41,442
battles of Legend Levels.

555
00:29:41,763 --> 00:29:44,323
Only 30,000 gold coins.

556
00:29:44,642 --> 00:29:45,922
30,000 gold coins?

557
00:29:46,323 --> 00:29:47,043
Sir,

558
00:29:47,763 --> 00:29:49,323
we're serious about buying.

559
00:29:49,483 --> 00:29:51,162
Could you give us a fair price?

560
00:29:51,483 --> 00:29:52,442
Well...

561
00:30:00,043 --> 00:30:02,402
20,000, and it can't go lower.

562
00:30:02,402 --> 00:30:04,083
20,000 is still not low, Sir.

563
00:30:34,842 --> 00:30:36,723
Sir, how much is this spear?

564
00:30:37,602 --> 00:30:40,003
Well, it's just scrap metal,

565
00:30:40,882 --> 00:30:42,162
and I was thinking of throwing it away.

566
00:30:42,323 --> 00:30:43,922
If you want it, just give me
any amount of money you like.

567
00:30:44,882 --> 00:30:45,642
Ying.

568
00:30:48,083 --> 00:30:49,963
Actually, we don't lack money.

569
00:30:50,122 --> 00:30:51,083
By saving a little each day,

570
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:51,963
Tong San and I

571
00:30:51,963 --> 00:30:53,723
should be able to afford a spear.

572
00:30:53,882 --> 00:30:54,963
Let's pick a better one.

573
00:30:54,963 --> 00:30:56,563
No, I want this one.

574
00:30:57,003 --> 00:30:58,202
It's a good one.

575
00:31:06,922 --> 00:31:09,083
(I'll name you Flying Snow Spear.)

576
00:31:09,122 --> 00:31:10,243
Only you would like

577
00:31:10,243 --> 00:31:11,043
this lousy spear.

578
00:31:11,763 --> 00:31:12,882
Ying,

579
00:31:13,402 --> 00:31:15,243
look what junk you've got.

580
00:31:17,563 --> 00:31:19,442
See, Tong San doesn't like it either.

581
00:31:19,523 --> 00:31:20,842
Ying, how about tomorrow

582
00:31:20,842 --> 00:31:21,922
I go with you to buy another one?

583
00:31:21,922 --> 00:31:23,402
No, I want this one.

584
00:31:25,922 --> 00:31:26,483
Well...

585
00:31:27,668 --> 00:31:30,288
(Dongbo Qingshi)

586
00:31:32,402 --> 00:31:32,922
I...

587
00:31:36,323 --> 00:31:36,882
Brother.

588
00:31:39,283 --> 00:31:39,922
Brother,

589
00:31:40,243 --> 00:31:41,003
look at this.

590
00:31:47,963 --> 00:31:49,682
Not bad, but keep working hard.

591
00:31:54,483 --> 00:31:55,362
Brother,

592
00:31:55,922 --> 00:31:57,202
you just bought this?

593
00:32:00,402 --> 00:32:01,202
Well, brother.

594
00:32:01,283 --> 00:32:02,922
Have you heard about the demon thing?

595
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:03,842
Yeah.

596
00:32:04,442 --> 00:32:05,602
The demons' origin is unknown.

597
00:32:05,963 --> 00:32:06,963
Don't go out at night.

598
00:32:08,122 --> 00:32:09,323
Even a matter related to demons

599
00:32:09,442 --> 00:32:10,922
can make you worry so much for me.

600
00:32:11,122 --> 00:32:12,362
How can I save our mother then?

601
00:32:12,483 --> 00:32:13,523
You don't need to worry

602
00:32:14,043 --> 00:32:15,043
about that.

603
00:32:15,602 --> 00:32:16,602
Focus on your training.

604
00:32:17,763 --> 00:32:18,963
You have outstanding spiritual power.

605
00:32:19,083 --> 00:32:20,483
You may be a promising mage.

606
00:32:21,083 --> 00:32:21,723
Brother,

607
00:32:21,803 --> 00:32:23,003
I will definitely train hard

608
00:32:23,122 --> 00:32:24,323
and defeat Moyang Chen with you

609
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:25,922
in the future.

610
00:32:30,602 --> 00:32:32,442
(Qingshi lost parents
when he was so young.)

611
00:32:32,723 --> 00:32:33,842
(He has suffered enough.)

612
00:32:34,682 --> 00:32:36,483
(Saving our mother is difficult.)

613
00:32:37,083 --> 00:32:37,963
(I'll handle)

614
00:32:37,963 --> 00:32:38,682
(the risks myself.)

615
00:32:39,523 --> 00:32:41,162
Demons are attacking our territory!

616
00:32:45,359 --> 00:32:46,945
(Hui An)

617
00:32:59,523 --> 00:33:00,523
Stay here.

618
00:33:09,442 --> 00:33:10,402
Ying, be careful.

619
00:33:10,842 --> 00:33:12,043
Why do you stop me?

620
00:33:12,043 --> 00:33:13,202
Let him have a try.

621
00:33:31,723 --> 00:33:33,202
Shi, are you okay?

622
00:33:33,243 --> 00:33:34,122
I'm fine.

623
00:34:08,043 --> 00:34:08,722
Ying.

624
00:34:09,523 --> 00:34:10,202
Ying,

625
00:34:10,883 --> 00:34:12,122
it really is a good spear.

626
00:34:18,963 --> 00:34:20,802
Brother, you're amazing.

627
00:34:21,923 --> 00:34:23,483
I knew this would be a good spear.

628
00:34:24,883 --> 00:34:25,883
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong San,

629
00:34:26,363 --> 00:34:27,483
you go back first and wait for me.

630
00:34:27,722 --> 00:34:28,523
Wait for me.

631
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:29,602
You can't go.

632
00:34:29,642 --> 00:34:30,722
Your skills are not strong enough.

633
00:34:30,802 --> 00:34:32,563
These demons have
no independent thoughts.

634
00:34:32,843 --> 00:34:34,043
They only know brute force.

635
00:34:34,242 --> 00:34:35,282
He won't get hurt.

636
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:24,523
(This is the True Meaning of Space)

637
00:35:24,523 --> 00:35:25,523
(that only Transcendent Knights
can use.)

638
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:40,472
(Chi Qiubai)

639
00:35:45,202 --> 00:35:46,162
Are you okay?

640
00:35:55,202 --> 00:35:56,602
May I ask your name, Sir?

641
00:35:57,403 --> 00:35:58,602
I am Chi Qiubai.

642
00:36:02,003 --> 00:36:03,162
Knight Changfeng.

643
00:36:04,483 --> 00:36:05,883
You are Knight Changfeng.

644
00:36:06,363 --> 00:36:07,682
You have no Dou Qi at all.

645
00:36:07,762 --> 00:36:08,923
Why would you take the risk?

646
00:36:09,762 --> 00:36:11,122
Demons are invading our territory.

647
00:36:11,202 --> 00:36:12,162
I must investigate.

648
00:36:12,403 --> 00:36:12,802
I have already passed on

649
00:36:12,843 --> 00:36:14,202
some Dou Qi to you.

650
00:36:14,363 --> 00:36:15,162
Perhaps it can stimulate

651
00:36:15,162 --> 00:36:16,282
your own Dou Qi.

652
00:36:16,722 --> 00:36:18,282
If you insist
on investigating the demons,

653
00:36:18,722 --> 00:36:19,762
be careful.

654
00:36:22,895 --> 00:36:24,633
(True Meaning of Space Split)

655
00:36:25,202 --> 00:36:26,122
Knight Changfeng.

656
00:36:29,443 --> 00:36:30,843
(Stimulating Dou Qi.)

657
00:36:43,802 --> 00:36:44,802
Just now, in Yishui City,

658
00:36:44,923 --> 00:36:46,202
I discovered traces of demons.

659
00:36:46,523 --> 00:36:47,722
The demons' spirit and strength

660
00:36:47,843 --> 00:36:49,282
are many times stronger
than an ordinary person's.

661
00:36:49,483 --> 00:36:50,483
Knight Changfeng,

662
00:36:50,602 --> 00:36:52,162
it's not a big deal.

663
00:36:52,282 --> 00:36:53,083
Back then, we paid

664
00:36:53,083 --> 00:36:54,443
such a high price

665
00:36:54,563 --> 00:36:55,843
to seal Da Er Hao.

666
00:36:55,963 --> 00:36:57,083
What do you mean now?

667
00:36:57,162 --> 00:36:59,162
Do you think the demons are coming back?

668
00:36:59,282 --> 00:37:00,003
I suggest

669
00:37:00,162 --> 00:37:01,642
first to investigate
the Destruction Mountain Range.

670
00:37:01,762 --> 00:37:03,322
The terrain there is complex,

671
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:04,602
and outsiders find it
hard to distinguish.

672
00:37:04,762 --> 00:37:06,242
There are many desperate fugitives

673
00:37:06,322 --> 00:37:07,483
and ferocious beasts hiding inside.

674
00:37:07,722 --> 00:37:08,762
If we can find out the connection

675
00:37:08,843 --> 00:37:10,122
between them and the demons,

676
00:37:10,202 --> 00:37:11,122
maybe we can figure out

677
00:37:11,202 --> 00:37:12,682
if it's related to the Demon Clan.

678
00:37:12,923 --> 00:37:14,202
Now, the matter of the demons

679
00:37:14,282 --> 00:37:14,963
is not only related

680
00:37:15,083 --> 00:37:16,602
to the safety
of the people in Yishui City.

681
00:37:16,722 --> 00:37:18,162
If it's related to the Demon Realm,

682
00:37:18,282 --> 00:37:19,483
then the saying that the Demon Clan

683
00:37:19,602 --> 00:37:21,523
is hiding among us

684
00:37:21,642 --> 00:37:23,003
is not baseless.

685
00:37:23,202 --> 00:37:24,202
Master Sikong,

686
00:37:24,483 --> 00:37:26,403
you have many Transcendent disciples.

687
00:37:26,523 --> 00:37:27,602
You might be in charge

688
00:37:27,722 --> 00:37:28,843
of the investigation.

689
00:37:28,923 --> 00:37:29,602
No way.

690
00:37:30,043 --> 00:37:30,523
This is the matter

691
00:37:30,602 --> 00:37:31,883
of the entire Dragon Mountain Empire.

692
00:37:32,003 --> 00:37:33,162
It's a matter of the Xia Clan.

693
00:37:33,443 --> 00:37:35,083
We all have a responsibility.

694
00:37:35,443 --> 00:37:36,523
We, the Sea God Palace,

695
00:37:36,642 --> 00:37:38,083
will definitely contribute.

696
00:37:38,322 --> 00:37:40,883
Tai Shu, you are reckless by nature.

697
00:37:41,003 --> 00:37:42,083
This time, we are in the light

698
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:43,963
while the demons hide in the shadows.

699
00:37:44,083 --> 00:37:45,443
Our temple will get to the bottom

700
00:37:45,523 --> 00:37:46,642
of it first

701
00:37:46,762 --> 00:37:48,242
and make it clearer to you.

702
00:37:49,483 --> 00:37:51,242
Or let Knight Changfeng investigate

703
00:37:51,363 --> 00:37:53,202
and let the Dragon Mountain Mansion
issue a reward at the same time.

704
00:37:53,242 --> 00:37:54,122
We'll do both.

705
00:37:54,363 --> 00:37:56,403
Everyone must be reassured now.

706
00:37:57,202 --> 00:37:58,003
Alright.

707
00:37:59,682 --> 00:38:00,322
Yes.

708
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,224
(Blessings and Auspices)

709
00:38:27,563 --> 00:38:28,523
Not bad.

710
00:38:28,642 --> 00:38:29,483
You just went for a day,

711
00:38:29,602 --> 00:38:31,122
and you have greatly improved
your skill with the spear.

712
00:38:31,403 --> 00:38:32,202
Not bad.

713
00:38:32,322 --> 00:38:33,322
I have to continue training

714
00:38:33,443 --> 00:38:34,642
to save my mother as soon as possible.

715
00:38:35,963 --> 00:38:37,843
Brother, I'm back.

716
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:42,242
(Notice)
The Dragon Mountain Mansion has issued a notice.

717
00:38:42,363 --> 00:38:42,963
The demons

718
00:38:42,963 --> 00:38:44,483
are hiding
in the Destruction Mountain Range.

719
00:38:44,563 --> 00:38:45,682
Whoever can find out the truth

720
00:38:45,802 --> 00:38:47,722
will be rewarded
with a Black Iron Order.

721
00:38:47,843 --> 00:38:48,483
Really?

722
00:38:48,602 --> 00:38:49,682
Absolutely.

723
00:38:51,722 --> 00:38:52,762
That's great.

724
00:38:53,483 --> 00:38:54,403
With the Black Iron Order,

725
00:38:54,682 --> 00:38:55,923
I can find out where my mother is.

726
00:38:56,122 --> 00:38:58,083
But the roads there are treacherous.

727
00:38:58,202 --> 00:38:59,843
It's basically a one-way trip.

728
00:39:00,043 --> 00:39:00,642
I'm not afraid.

729
00:39:01,043 --> 00:39:02,602
Brother, I don't want you to go.

730
00:39:02,682 --> 00:39:03,963
I have already lost my parents.

731
00:39:04,242 --> 00:39:05,563
I can't afford to lose you.

732
00:39:05,642 --> 00:39:06,843
I don't agree.

733
00:39:07,722 --> 00:39:08,443
Is it worth taking such a risk

734
00:39:08,563 --> 00:39:09,963
for a Black Iron Order?

735
00:39:10,083 --> 00:39:11,043
Not just for the Black Iron Order.

736
00:39:11,242 --> 00:39:12,122
If we don't figure out this matter,

737
00:39:12,242 --> 00:39:13,122
and the demons come again,

738
00:39:13,242 --> 00:39:14,122
we'll all be in danger.

739
00:39:14,242 --> 00:39:15,363
Then I'll go with you.

740
00:39:16,083 --> 00:39:16,762
Shi,

741
00:39:18,083 --> 00:39:19,403
I'll accompany
your brother on this trip.

742
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,682
You and Tong guard the Xueying Territory

743
00:39:20,682 --> 00:39:21,363
and wait for me to come back.

744
00:39:21,483 --> 00:39:22,083
Zong Ling.

745
00:39:22,083 --> 00:39:23,802
Alright, it's settled then.

746
00:39:24,923 --> 00:39:25,602
Well...

747
00:39:32,843 --> 00:39:33,642
High Priest,

748
00:39:34,043 --> 00:39:35,563
it was because of Ge Bin's incompetence

749
00:39:35,682 --> 00:39:36,923
that those demons escaped.

750
00:39:37,043 --> 00:39:38,122
Useless.

751
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:41,682
Go back and tell Ge Bin.

752
00:39:41,843 --> 00:39:43,563
If he can't handle this,

753
00:39:43,802 --> 00:39:45,563
(High Priest of Demon Clan)
he and his entire Bent Blade Union

754
00:39:45,563 --> 00:39:46,642
(Xiang Pangyun)
will disappear.

755
00:39:46,722 --> 00:39:47,322
Yes.

756
00:39:51,923 --> 00:39:55,563
It's time the empire changes hands.

757
00:40:00,403 --> 00:40:01,523
Back in my prime,

758
00:40:01,642 --> 00:40:03,523
I was making waves in the world,

759
00:40:03,722 --> 00:40:05,403
but now I've fallen so much,

760
00:40:05,483 --> 00:40:06,963
associating with the likes of you.

761
00:40:06,963 --> 00:40:07,602
Get off.

762
00:40:08,923 --> 00:40:09,722
Boss,

763
00:40:09,843 --> 00:40:10,523
once we complete

764
00:40:10,523 --> 00:40:11,602
this demon mission,

765
00:40:11,762 --> 00:40:13,443
with the High Priest backing us up,

766
00:40:13,682 --> 00:40:14,883
(Ge Bin)
you'll be able to do whatever you want

767
00:40:14,883 --> 00:40:16,403
in the Dragon Mountain Empire.

768
00:40:16,563 --> 00:40:18,202
You have quite the imagination.

769
00:40:19,242 --> 00:40:20,602
They chose to create demons

770
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:21,523
in this place

771
00:40:21,523 --> 00:40:23,282
because the Destruction Mountain Range

772
00:40:24,003 --> 00:40:26,043
is a barren land.

773
00:40:26,642 --> 00:40:28,403
If the demon mission fails,

774
00:40:28,483 --> 00:40:30,202
our lives will be at stake.

775
00:40:30,923 --> 00:40:31,483
Why don't we

776
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,963
take away

777
00:40:33,122 --> 00:40:34,443
the Ocean Realm Stone

778
00:40:34,563 --> 00:40:36,242
just in case something goes wrong?

779
00:40:36,523 --> 00:40:38,963
We are just their tools

780
00:40:40,083 --> 00:40:43,322
and ants they can crush at will.

781
00:40:44,843 --> 00:40:46,963
If you touch that stone,

782
00:40:47,682 --> 00:40:50,363
you may get yourself
turned into a demon.

783
00:40:52,242 --> 00:40:52,963
So...

784
00:40:53,363 --> 00:40:55,242
either way, it's death.

785
00:40:55,523 --> 00:40:56,363
Get rid of everyone

786
00:40:56,483 --> 00:40:58,003
who comes in,

787
00:40:59,043 --> 00:41:00,523
and your head can stay

788
00:41:00,722 --> 00:41:03,403
on your neck for a few more days.

789
00:41:18,202 --> 00:41:18,963
Demons!

790
00:41:19,083 --> 00:41:20,282
Uncle Zong, let's leave.

791
00:41:34,963 --> 00:41:36,242
These demons seem

792
00:41:36,403 --> 00:41:37,963
like ordinary people

793
00:41:38,242 --> 00:41:39,363
with no attack power.

794
00:41:53,483 --> 00:41:54,563
That flute player

795
00:41:54,563 --> 00:41:55,883
must be the leader,

796
00:41:56,083 --> 00:41:57,282
probably an insider.

797
00:41:57,403 --> 00:41:58,523
Let's cut off the head of the snake.

798
00:41:58,682 --> 00:41:59,523
Capture him and ask.

799
00:42:59,242 --> 00:43:00,602
Ying, be careful.

800
00:43:14,083 --> 00:43:16,003
Who gave you the guts

801
00:43:16,122 --> 00:43:17,923
to come to my territory?

802
00:43:18,363 --> 00:43:19,523
You are Ge Bin?

803
00:43:19,602 --> 00:43:20,403
Ge Bin?

804
00:43:20,483 --> 00:43:21,282
Well?

805
00:43:21,722 --> 00:43:22,403
You must have heard

806
00:43:22,483 --> 00:43:24,162
of my name, right?

807
00:43:27,483 --> 00:43:29,122
The Bent Blade Union is notorious.

808
00:43:29,242 --> 00:43:30,483
It seems this time the demons

809
00:43:30,602 --> 00:43:32,043
are related to you guys.

810
00:43:32,083 --> 00:43:33,682
Still stubborn when facing death.

811
00:43:33,762 --> 00:43:34,923
Today I will send you...

812
00:43:34,923 --> 00:43:36,322
To your death.

813
00:43:36,682 --> 00:43:39,563
To your death!

814
00:43:41,322 --> 00:43:44,642
To your death!

815
00:43:49,403 --> 00:43:51,083
B-B-Boss.

816
00:44:36,642 --> 00:44:38,003
With just a little Dou Qi,

817
00:44:38,083 --> 00:44:40,003
how dare you come here!

818
00:44:40,122 --> 00:44:40,843
That's right.

819
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:12,386
(Cul-de-sac Attack)

820
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,322
This is the Meteor Level Dou Qi.

821
00:45:27,403 --> 00:45:28,483
Die!

822
00:45:39,885 --> 00:45:41,284
(Yu Jingqiu)

823
00:46:07,202 --> 00:46:08,043
(She must be at least)

824
00:46:08,043 --> 00:46:09,122
(at the Meteor Level.)

825
00:46:18,927 --> 00:46:21,144
(Freezing Frost)

826
00:46:21,363 --> 00:46:22,443
(It seems she is a mage)

827
00:46:22,762 --> 00:46:23,602
(using spiritual power)

828
00:46:24,122 --> 00:46:25,162
