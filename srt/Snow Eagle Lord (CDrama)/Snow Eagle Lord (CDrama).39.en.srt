Mother.

23
00:01:53,112 --> 00:01:53,911
I finally found

24
00:01:53,911 --> 00:01:55,271
my father and mother.

25
00:01:55,792 --> 00:01:56,952
The Lord and Lady of Moxue Empire

26
00:01:56,952 --> 00:01:57,672
were here.

27
00:01:58,592 --> 00:01:59,752
No wonder Master and Mrs. Xue

28
00:01:59,752 --> 00:02:00,351
have been searching for so many years

29
00:02:00,351 --> 00:02:01,112
but couldn't find them.

30
00:02:01,991 --> 00:02:02,792
I can't let them

31
00:02:02,792 --> 00:02:03,752
keep lying here.

32
00:02:06,071 --> 00:02:07,631
I am going to take them home.

33
00:02:10,072 --> 00:02:10,711
Jingqiu,

34
00:02:11,431 --> 00:02:12,352
calm down.

35
00:02:13,632 --> 00:02:14,831
They've been lying here for so long,

36
00:02:14,831 --> 00:02:16,031
yet they are unharmed.

37
00:02:16,672 --> 00:02:18,192
It must have something
to do with this bed.

38
00:02:19,311 --> 00:02:20,672
If you move them rashly,

39
00:02:21,072 --> 00:02:22,632
I am afraid before you make them
out of the Red Stone Mountain,

40
00:02:23,031 --> 00:02:24,591
their bodies will be damaged,

41
00:02:24,751 --> 00:02:26,031
until they vanish.

42
00:02:26,711 --> 00:02:28,031
What should I do then?

43
00:02:30,551 --> 00:02:31,352
Don't worry.

44
00:02:32,392 --> 00:02:33,871
If they can stay here for so many years,

45
00:02:34,352 --> 00:02:35,831
then this place must be safe.

46
00:02:37,232 --> 00:02:39,472
After we get the secret manuals,

47
00:02:41,311 --> 00:02:42,991
let's come back and take them home.

48
00:02:43,831 --> 00:02:44,472
Is that okay?

49
00:02:50,192 --> 00:02:50,991
Okay.

50
00:02:58,751 --> 00:03:00,151
Master, Senior,

51
00:03:00,311 --> 00:03:01,912
please help them.

52
00:03:02,031 --> 00:03:03,591
They fell from Floating Island,

53
00:03:03,711 --> 00:03:05,151
but I believe they're not dead.

54
00:03:05,912 --> 00:03:07,431
We've told you before

55
00:03:07,591 --> 00:03:08,632
that the test of Red Stone Mountain

56
00:03:08,751 --> 00:03:10,472
is not easy to pass.

57
00:03:10,591 --> 00:03:11,831
If you fail the test,

58
00:03:11,952 --> 00:03:12,952
you lose.

59
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,431
It's fate whether you live or die.

60
00:03:18,031 --> 00:03:18,672
Xueying.

61
00:03:18,672 --> 00:03:20,271
- Xueying
- Jingqiu.

62
00:03:20,672 --> 00:03:21,392
Are you alright?

63
00:03:23,472 --> 00:03:23,952
Let's go.

64
00:03:27,072 --> 00:03:27,952
They survived

65
00:03:27,952 --> 00:03:29,192
after falling from Floating Island.

66
00:03:29,392 --> 00:03:31,151
This is Master of Red Stone Mountain.

67
00:03:32,672 --> 00:03:33,352
Master.

68
00:03:34,352 --> 00:03:35,711
The only daughter

69
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:36,912
of Lord and Lady of Moxue Empire.

70
00:03:37,151 --> 00:03:39,551
I can't accept your honor.

71
00:03:40,551 --> 00:03:43,031
Since you've passed the test,

72
00:03:43,271 --> 00:03:46,112
being rewarded is a must.

73
00:03:47,311 --> 00:03:48,912
Future rewards

74
00:03:49,072 --> 00:03:50,672
will depend on your own cultivation.

75
00:03:55,831 --> 00:03:56,632
Thank you, Master.

76
00:04:00,431 --> 00:04:01,352
Thank you, Master.

77
00:04:02,632 --> 00:04:03,711
Thank you, Master.

78
00:04:05,472 --> 00:04:06,792
Snow Phantom Spell.

79
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:07,672
That's right.

80
00:04:07,831 --> 00:04:09,871
The spell not only contains

81
00:04:09,952 --> 00:04:11,031
the techniques related to snows,

82
00:04:11,151 --> 00:04:12,831
but also can help you heal

83
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,112
the damage to your pulse

84
00:04:14,112 --> 00:04:15,912
after removing your divine veins.

85
00:04:15,991 --> 00:04:18,191
Although its attack is not strong,

86
00:04:18,311 --> 00:04:20,112
the spell

87
00:04:20,112 --> 00:04:21,112
is more healing.

88
00:04:21,232 --> 00:04:23,032
When your pulse is healed,

89
00:04:23,152 --> 00:04:25,751
your ability to master the spell
will have a great breakthrough.

90
00:04:26,071 --> 00:04:28,352
Practice here at ease.

91
00:04:29,631 --> 00:04:30,951
Thank you, Master.

92
00:04:32,232 --> 00:04:34,951
The Lord and Lady of Moxue Empire once

93
00:04:35,032 --> 00:04:37,032
protected Dragon Mountain Empire
with their lives.

94
00:04:37,112 --> 00:04:39,352
Now, it's our turn

95
00:04:39,431 --> 00:04:41,991
to protect their daughter.

96
00:04:55,112 --> 00:04:56,232
There's something I don't understand.

97
00:04:58,272 --> 00:05:00,032
Xueying was poisoned by
the Witch God Sword,

98
00:05:00,472 --> 00:05:02,071
which there is no way to solve.

99
00:05:02,352 --> 00:05:03,431
He's going to die sooner or later.

100
00:05:03,431 --> 00:05:04,951
Why are you so eager to kill him?

101
00:05:05,071 --> 00:05:06,792
Because he has the Ancient Bloodline.

102
00:05:07,311 --> 00:05:08,912
This is how Moyang Yu

103
00:05:08,912 --> 00:05:10,311
destroyed the body of Great Demon God

104
00:05:10,431 --> 00:05:11,712
and we couldn't find it back.

105
00:05:11,871 --> 00:05:13,592
We have to keep an eye on
the Ancient Bloodline.

106
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:16,511
Anyway, we have got

107
00:05:16,511 --> 00:05:17,511
the Ancient Bloodline

108
00:05:17,672 --> 00:05:19,232
to refine the Soul Condensing Pill.

109
00:05:20,112 --> 00:05:22,071
Dongbo Xueying is no longer useful.

110
00:05:22,431 --> 00:05:23,991
As Great Demon God has no body,

111
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,191
where is he living now?

112
00:05:26,472 --> 00:05:27,311
Is it safe?

113
00:05:27,551 --> 00:05:28,712
Very safe.

114
00:05:29,311 --> 00:05:30,472
When you strengthen

115
00:05:30,472 --> 00:05:31,631
your demonic technique in the future,

116
00:05:32,112 --> 00:05:33,311
it will be safer.

117
00:05:44,511 --> 00:05:45,712
There're demons invading.

118
00:05:47,191 --> 00:05:48,511
How did they chase us here?

119
00:05:48,631 --> 00:05:49,832
Don't worry too much.

120
00:05:50,032 --> 00:05:51,391
Over the years, countless people

121
00:05:51,391 --> 00:05:52,751
have come here
to steal the secret manuals.

122
00:05:52,832 --> 00:05:54,112
All of them went in, but none came out.

123
00:05:54,232 --> 00:05:56,352
Not to mention
we're in the Red Stone Illusion.

124
00:05:56,631 --> 00:05:57,832
Red Stone Illusion?

125
00:05:58,152 --> 00:05:59,232
My parents are there.

126
00:05:59,592 --> 00:06:00,272
Puyang Bo,

127
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:01,551
practice with Youyue here.

128
00:06:01,631 --> 00:06:03,071
We'll go check it out. Let's go.

129
00:06:14,352 --> 00:06:15,951
The Lord and Lady of Moxue Empire.

130
00:06:16,551 --> 00:06:18,071
They've been dead for a long time.

131
00:06:18,551 --> 00:06:19,352
I can't believe their bodies

132
00:06:19,352 --> 00:06:20,551
should be well-preserved.

133
00:06:22,391 --> 00:06:23,391
Great Demon God

134
00:06:23,391 --> 00:06:24,672
has been looking for a new body.

135
00:06:25,391 --> 00:06:27,032
Heaven is really helping the Demon Clan.

136
00:06:27,152 --> 00:06:28,631
Now, without any effort,

137
00:06:28,871 --> 00:06:30,472
we can revive Great Demon God.

138
00:06:33,272 --> 00:06:35,152
The Lord and Lady of Moxue Empire
came from the Divine Realm.

139
00:06:35,391 --> 00:06:36,912
They can't stay
in the human world for so long.

140
00:06:37,152 --> 00:06:38,472
Moreover, they're dead.

141
00:06:38,592 --> 00:06:39,951
There must be
something strange about this.

142
00:06:40,431 --> 00:06:41,352
Let's go back

143
00:06:41,352 --> 00:06:42,431
and make a long-term plan.

144
00:06:43,272 --> 00:06:44,232
Chi Qiubai,

145
00:06:45,232 --> 00:06:45,912
I think

146
00:06:45,912 --> 00:06:47,912
you have not fully surrendered to
the Demon Clan yet.

147
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,712
The body of a god is precious.

148
00:06:50,232 --> 00:06:51,152
This matter

149
00:06:51,232 --> 00:06:52,712
is related to
the resurrection of the Demon Clan.

150
00:06:52,871 --> 00:06:53,592
I think

151
00:06:53,751 --> 00:06:55,112
we must be careful and cautious.

152
00:06:55,511 --> 00:06:56,631
Any mishap

153
00:06:56,631 --> 00:06:58,712
would cause a catastrophe.

154
00:07:00,071 --> 00:07:01,991
No need for your concern.

155
00:07:06,631 --> 00:07:07,232
Stop!

156
00:07:07,832 --> 00:07:08,991
What are you doing?

157
00:07:09,391 --> 00:07:10,391
Ao Lan.

158
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:13,751
Master?

159
00:07:14,272 --> 00:07:15,191
Master?

160
00:07:24,071 --> 00:07:25,032
Why?

161
00:07:26,431 --> 00:07:27,631
No reason.

162
00:07:27,951 --> 00:07:30,032
Impossible. I don't believe it.

163
00:07:33,232 --> 00:07:34,112
Stop!

164
00:07:37,511 --> 00:07:38,112
Jingqiu.

165
00:07:55,631 --> 00:07:56,912
I'll leave it to you.

166
00:08:12,311 --> 00:08:13,071
Xueying.

167
00:08:16,352 --> 00:08:17,311
Xueying,

168
00:08:19,191 --> 00:08:20,592
you are too weak now.

169
00:08:24,792 --> 00:08:25,672
Why?

170
00:08:27,152 --> 00:08:29,991
Tell me. Why?

171
00:08:34,791 --> 00:08:35,712
Xueying,

172
00:08:37,192 --> 00:08:38,911
if you want to inherit
the will of Dragon Mountain,

173
00:08:40,592 --> 00:08:42,432
you must learn to live bravely
and have the courage to face death.

174
00:08:43,312 --> 00:08:44,112
Xueying.

175
00:08:47,232 --> 00:08:49,352
Xueying, Xueying!

176
00:08:52,871 --> 00:08:53,631
Xueying.

177
00:08:53,712 --> 00:08:54,791
- Xueying.
- Xueying.

178
00:08:54,871 --> 00:08:55,832
What happened to him?

179
00:08:56,271 --> 00:08:57,072
What's wrong?

180
00:08:58,552 --> 00:08:59,232
Master,

181
00:08:59,671 --> 00:09:01,791
please, I beg you.

182
00:09:02,352 --> 00:09:03,791
Please save Xueying.

183
00:09:03,871 --> 00:09:04,631
Master,

184
00:09:04,751 --> 00:09:06,112
please save Xueying.

185
00:09:06,232 --> 00:09:07,552
Master, please.

186
00:09:07,552 --> 00:09:08,751
Please save Xueying.

187
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,511
Xueying's poison is too severe.

188
00:09:12,432 --> 00:09:13,911
There's no turning back.

189
00:09:15,552 --> 00:09:16,751
How it will develop

190
00:09:17,511 --> 00:09:19,232
all depends on his fate.

191
00:09:35,911 --> 00:09:37,031
(Where is it?)

192
00:09:37,631 --> 00:09:39,031
(How can there be such a place)

193
00:09:39,352 --> 00:09:40,871
(in the Red Stone Mountain's barrier?)

194
00:09:46,552 --> 00:09:47,271
Brother.

195
00:09:49,592 --> 00:09:50,712
Qingshi,

196
00:09:54,432 --> 00:09:55,432
why are you here?

197
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,232
Brother, of course, I'm here.

198
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:58,352
Why are you dawdling?

199
00:09:58,352 --> 00:09:59,432
We are all waiting for you alone.

200
00:09:59,631 --> 00:10:00,671
Hurry up, let's go.

201
00:10:02,671 --> 00:10:03,391
Let's go.

202
00:10:23,511 --> 00:10:25,712
Xueying, it's such a big day.

203
00:10:25,832 --> 00:10:27,391
How can you be late?

204
00:10:27,552 --> 00:10:28,631
This child.

205
00:10:28,791 --> 00:10:29,871
How embarrassing.

206
00:10:32,631 --> 00:10:33,472
Ying.

207
00:10:33,592 --> 00:10:34,871
You must be so happy
that you're dumbfounded.

208
00:10:35,031 --> 00:10:35,592
Exactly.

209
00:10:36,072 --> 00:10:37,751
Ying, don't just stand there.

210
00:10:37,952 --> 00:10:39,271
Quickly kneel down and greet.

211
00:10:54,511 --> 00:10:55,271
Father.

212
00:10:56,232 --> 00:10:56,991
Mother.

213
00:10:59,552 --> 00:11:00,631
I miss you.

214
00:11:01,671 --> 00:11:03,031
Look at you.

215
00:11:03,712 --> 00:11:05,391
You're married now.

216
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,952
Why are you still acting like a child?

217
00:11:08,271 --> 00:11:09,352
Who does he take after?

218
00:11:09,511 --> 00:11:10,432
After me, of course.

219
00:11:12,312 --> 00:11:13,151
Get up, good boy.

220
00:11:13,151 --> 00:11:14,232
I bet it's because Brother

221
00:11:14,232 --> 00:11:15,151
is too elated

222
00:11:15,151 --> 00:11:16,072
to marry a beautiful sister-in-law.

223
00:11:16,432 --> 00:11:17,871
Uncle Zong, Uncle Tong San,

224
00:11:17,991 --> 00:11:18,832
what's this called?

225
00:11:19,472 --> 00:11:20,671
Tears of joy.

226
00:11:25,552 --> 00:11:26,871
Father, Mother,
may you be in good health.

227
00:11:26,991 --> 00:11:28,072
Good.

228
00:11:28,911 --> 00:11:29,791
Jingqiu,

229
00:11:30,871 --> 00:11:32,072
have you recovered?

230
00:11:32,552 --> 00:11:33,552
Why did you come

231
00:11:33,552 --> 00:11:34,432
to greet them alone?

232
00:11:34,432 --> 00:11:35,552
Why didn't you call me?

233
00:11:36,151 --> 00:11:37,671
I'm afraid you're tired.

234
00:11:40,391 --> 00:11:41,991
Jingqiu, let's go.

235
00:11:42,112 --> 00:11:43,192
Let's go eat, just the two of us.

236
00:11:43,192 --> 00:11:43,952
Leave them alone.

237
00:11:57,432 --> 00:11:58,991
(How I wish)

238
00:12:00,072 --> 00:12:01,151
(all of this is real.)

239
00:12:06,151 --> 00:12:07,192
(But I know)

240
00:12:08,791 --> 00:12:09,952
(it's all an illusion.)

241
00:12:12,552 --> 00:12:14,192
(Is this real?)

242
00:12:16,072 --> 00:12:17,312
(Or an illusion?)

243
00:12:39,472 --> 00:12:41,031
(Is this real?)

244
00:12:42,312 --> 00:12:43,511
(Or an illusion?)

245
00:12:45,151 --> 00:12:45,952
Father.

246
00:12:47,991 --> 00:12:48,991
Mother.

247
00:12:53,552 --> 00:12:54,952
Parallel universe?

248
00:12:55,671 --> 00:12:56,832
Parallel universe

249
00:12:56,952 --> 00:12:58,312
is  not an illusory world,

250
00:12:58,671 --> 00:13:00,592
but a real existing universe.

251
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:02,472
The Red Stone Barrier is just like that.

252
00:13:03,192 --> 00:13:04,472
Every practitioner

253
00:13:04,592 --> 00:13:05,791
can live

254
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:08,072
another life here.

255
00:13:08,391 --> 00:13:09,352
Are there

256
00:13:09,552 --> 00:13:11,271
parents and friends too?

257
00:13:11,432 --> 00:13:11,871
Yes.

258
00:13:11,871 --> 00:13:13,991
There you have everything you want.

259
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:16,871
Any person and anything

260
00:13:16,991 --> 00:13:19,631
you most desire and anticipate.

261
00:13:19,751 --> 00:13:20,991
Over the years,

262
00:13:21,151 --> 00:13:22,712
all the practitioners

263
00:13:22,712 --> 00:13:23,472
who've entered the parallel universes

264
00:13:23,472 --> 00:13:24,592
chose to stay

265
00:13:24,592 --> 00:13:25,751
without exception.

266
00:13:25,911 --> 00:13:26,911
Because the life there

267
00:13:27,072 --> 00:13:28,991
is their dream life.

268
00:13:29,232 --> 00:13:31,511
Xueying might also

269
00:13:31,511 --> 00:13:33,271
make the same choice.

270
00:13:35,791 --> 00:13:37,232
The Red Stone Secrets are precious.

271
00:13:37,592 --> 00:13:38,911
After twelve hours,

272
00:13:38,911 --> 00:13:39,712
the writing on them

273
00:13:39,712 --> 00:13:41,151
will all disappear.

274
00:13:41,271 --> 00:13:42,352
You better hurry up

275
00:13:42,352 --> 00:13:43,391
and start cultivating.

276
00:13:43,751 --> 00:13:45,192
As for Dongbo Xueying,

277
00:13:45,312 --> 00:13:46,552
whether he can come back

278
00:13:46,712 --> 00:13:48,151
depends on him.

279
00:13:48,631 --> 00:13:49,952
I believe in Xueying.

280
00:13:50,832 --> 00:13:52,592
He has never let me down.

281
00:13:56,391 --> 00:13:57,072
Jingqiu,

282
00:13:57,192 --> 00:13:58,671
what exactly happened?

283
00:14:00,511 --> 00:14:02,391
Chi Qiubai betrayed the Xia Clan.

284
00:14:02,791 --> 00:14:03,712
He helped Ao Lan

285
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:05,192
steal the bodies of my parents.

286
00:14:05,192 --> 00:14:06,472
Chi Qiubai?

287
00:14:06,991 --> 00:14:08,031
I didn't expect

288
00:14:08,472 --> 00:14:09,592
all these years,

289
00:14:09,871 --> 00:14:11,031
the master

290
00:14:11,031 --> 00:14:12,352
who has been teaching us

291
00:14:13,312 --> 00:14:14,271
actually...

292
00:14:16,832 --> 00:14:17,871
Xueying.

293
00:14:30,871 --> 00:14:31,511
Mother.

294
00:14:35,151 --> 00:14:37,791
Xueying, why are you here?

295
00:14:38,031 --> 00:14:40,151
Nothing. I just came to see you.

296
00:14:41,192 --> 00:14:42,712
What's so good about watching me?

297
00:14:42,832 --> 00:14:43,511
If you want to look at someone,

298
00:14:43,671 --> 00:14:45,031
watch your wife.

299
00:14:47,631 --> 00:14:48,271
Mother,

300
00:14:49,271 --> 00:14:51,832
are you happy here?

301
00:14:53,871 --> 00:14:54,952
Happy indeed.

302
00:14:55,271 --> 00:14:57,552
Look, we have the family.

303
00:14:57,671 --> 00:14:58,671
We have you all.

304
00:14:58,791 --> 00:15:00,271
And these beautiful flowers.

305
00:15:00,391 --> 00:15:01,712
Of course, I am happy.

306
00:15:03,991 --> 00:15:05,552
If you and Jingqiu

307
00:15:05,712 --> 00:15:07,391
could give me a grandson,

308
00:15:08,031 --> 00:15:09,352
I would be even happier.

309
00:15:10,911 --> 00:15:13,592
Yes, if it really happens,

310
00:15:13,871 --> 00:15:15,271
it would be perfect.

311
00:15:17,671 --> 00:15:18,751
What's wrong with you?

312
00:15:19,832 --> 00:15:20,952
You're acting strange.

313
00:15:21,631 --> 00:15:22,352
Did you encounter

314
00:15:22,352 --> 00:15:23,671
any trouble?

315
00:15:28,072 --> 00:15:29,112
I'm a bit scared.

316
00:15:29,832 --> 00:15:31,072
What are you scared of?

317
00:15:32,391 --> 00:15:33,391
I'm scared

318
00:15:34,511 --> 00:15:36,192
all of this will disappear.

319
00:15:37,791 --> 00:15:39,592
I'm scared I won't achieve anything.

320
00:15:40,192 --> 00:15:43,312
I'm even more scared of
disappointing everyone.

321
00:15:48,631 --> 00:15:49,911
Actually,

322
00:15:50,232 --> 00:15:52,952
others' expectations aren't important.

323
00:15:53,232 --> 00:15:55,671
What's important is your own thoughts.

324
00:15:56,511 --> 00:15:57,871
Like those flowers,

325
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,192
they only bloom for a season

326
00:16:01,552 --> 00:16:02,871
and then they wither.

327
00:16:03,592 --> 00:16:04,991
But so what?

328
00:16:05,432 --> 00:16:07,472
They've been beautiful.
They've bloomed.

329
00:16:07,671 --> 00:16:09,112
And they are happy.

330
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:12,871
So as long as you are happy.

331
00:16:15,031 --> 00:16:16,391
I just need to be happy.

332
00:16:17,432 --> 00:16:18,871
No need to take responsibility?

333
00:16:22,151 --> 00:16:23,271
Actually,

334
00:16:24,112 --> 00:16:25,911
for most people,

335
00:16:26,751 --> 00:16:27,952
being able to live their entire lives

336
00:16:28,192 --> 00:16:29,832
safely and happily

337
00:16:30,592 --> 00:16:31,312
is already

338
00:16:31,312 --> 00:16:32,751
a very hard thing.

339
00:16:34,352 --> 00:16:35,592
As for responsibility,

340
00:16:36,192 --> 00:16:37,511
let others take it.

341
00:16:43,952 --> 00:16:45,312
What are you laughing at?

342
00:16:46,791 --> 00:16:48,031
I was just thinking

343
00:16:48,552 --> 00:16:50,552
having an irresponsible mother

344
00:16:50,911 --> 00:16:51,832
is quite nice.

345
00:16:51,952 --> 00:16:53,472
Of course, it's nice.

346
00:16:54,911 --> 00:16:55,592
Mother,

347
00:16:57,151 --> 00:16:58,112
there's something

348
00:16:58,312 --> 00:16:59,911
I've never told you.

349
00:17:00,631 --> 00:17:01,472
Go ahead.

350
00:17:06,871 --> 00:17:07,671
Thank you.

351
00:17:09,431 --> 00:17:10,711
Thank you for being my mother.

352
00:17:14,191 --> 00:17:15,711
You don't know how happy I am

353
00:17:16,431 --> 00:17:17,592
to have you.

354
00:17:45,032 --> 00:17:47,951
(The backlash
of the demonic pill is truly intense.)

355
00:17:54,072 --> 00:17:55,671
Situ Hong, it's me.

356
00:18:01,032 --> 00:18:02,272
Why are you following me?

357
00:18:02,752 --> 00:18:03,911
You're injured, aren't you?

358
00:18:03,992 --> 00:18:04,832
Let me see.

359
00:18:08,032 --> 00:18:09,752
These are some instruments I've collected

360
00:18:09,951 --> 00:18:11,072
and some healing medicine.

361
00:18:11,272 --> 00:18:12,792
Don't go out recently.

362
00:18:12,911 --> 00:18:14,752
People from Xinhuo Palace
are looking for you.

363
00:18:14,871 --> 00:18:15,951
If they catch you,

364
00:18:15,951 --> 00:18:16,911
you are dead.

365
00:18:20,911 --> 00:18:21,871
I don't need

366
00:18:22,631 --> 00:18:23,512
these things.

367
00:18:24,391 --> 00:18:25,671
At this point,

368
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:26,671
why are you still being stubborn?

369
00:18:26,992 --> 00:18:29,032
I don't need anyone's pity.

370
00:18:30,151 --> 00:18:32,312
Situ Hong, do you know?

371
00:18:32,592 --> 00:18:34,352
We met a long time ago.

372
00:18:34,711 --> 00:18:35,631
At that time,

373
00:18:35,671 --> 00:18:36,832
you were just

374
00:18:36,832 --> 00:18:38,312
an unknown kid in the Si Family.

375
00:18:39,272 --> 00:18:41,352
Brother, it's just

376
00:18:41,352 --> 00:18:42,592
some idle words.

377
00:18:42,592 --> 00:18:43,911
Why take them to heart?

378
00:18:44,072 --> 00:18:45,352
They say I'm dependent on others.

379
00:18:45,552 --> 00:18:46,992
I was born but had no parents.

380
00:18:47,871 --> 00:18:48,992
They are not wrong.

381
00:18:49,112 --> 00:18:49,951
Let them say whatever they want.

382
00:18:50,151 --> 00:18:51,191
Since you said it,

383
00:18:51,191 --> 00:18:52,671
just ignore them.

384
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:53,992
Come back with me.

385
00:18:55,552 --> 00:18:56,512
No matter what it is,

386
00:18:56,671 --> 00:18:57,711
come back with me first.

387
00:18:58,072 --> 00:19:00,191
This forest is uninhabited.

388
00:19:00,191 --> 00:19:01,272
All sorts of beasts and demons

389
00:19:01,272 --> 00:19:02,272
could appear at any time.

390
00:19:02,352 --> 00:19:04,431
It's too dangerous for you to go alone.

391
00:19:04,592 --> 00:19:05,671
Since you don't care,

392
00:19:05,832 --> 00:19:07,112
why be angry?

393
00:19:07,352 --> 00:19:08,352
Angry?

394
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,112
How could it be?

395
00:19:10,552 --> 00:19:12,112
But, little brother,

396
00:19:12,231 --> 00:19:13,671
you really need to help me.

397
00:19:13,832 --> 00:19:15,032
Brother, just say it.

398
00:19:18,032 --> 00:19:20,391
W-What are you doing?

399
00:19:25,471 --> 00:19:26,471
You go back

400
00:19:26,671 --> 00:19:27,752
and tell the clan leader and others

401
00:19:27,871 --> 00:19:28,711
you didn't find me.

402
00:19:28,832 --> 00:19:29,631
Only found this

403
00:19:29,631 --> 00:19:30,512
on the edge of the forbidden forest.

404
00:19:33,592 --> 00:19:34,512
Do as I say.

405
00:19:42,471 --> 00:19:44,352
He wants to use this method

406
00:19:44,592 --> 00:19:46,512
to scare the clan elders.

407
00:19:47,711 --> 00:19:49,231
Get those who bullied him

408
00:19:49,231 --> 00:19:50,191
to be punished, right?

409
00:19:52,191 --> 00:19:53,871
Such a scheming kid.

410
00:20:32,191 --> 00:20:33,151
Are you okay?

411
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:34,951
I'm fine.

412
00:20:43,792 --> 00:20:45,191
Thank you for saving me.

413
00:20:45,191 --> 00:20:46,032
You saved me too.

414
00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:47,272
We owe each other nothing.

415
00:20:47,911 --> 00:20:48,992
Facing such a strong beastman,

416
00:20:48,992 --> 00:20:49,792
you're not scared.

417
00:20:50,191 --> 00:20:50,992
How could you

418
00:20:50,992 --> 00:20:52,832
be bullied by the young men in the clan?

419
00:20:53,631 --> 00:20:55,272
And you even pretended to be pitiful.

420
00:20:55,471 --> 00:20:57,391
You could have easily
taken down a group of them.

421
00:20:59,072 --> 00:21:00,391
You've been following me for a while.

422
00:21:00,512 --> 00:21:01,631
I did not.

423
00:21:02,671 --> 00:21:04,191
I just happened to pass by.

424
00:21:04,911 --> 00:21:06,072
Out of curiosity.

425
00:21:07,911 --> 00:21:08,871
They...

426
00:21:09,272 --> 00:21:10,832
They're not worth my sword.

427
00:21:11,272 --> 00:21:12,471
Insulting one's own clan

428
00:21:12,592 --> 00:21:14,272
will be severely punished
by their families.

429
00:21:14,391 --> 00:21:16,391
I just reminded the Elders

430
00:21:16,391 --> 00:21:18,191
of the word fairness.

431
00:21:18,312 --> 00:21:19,352
Fairness.

432
00:21:20,911 --> 00:21:21,871
You do have a knack.

433
00:21:21,871 --> 00:21:23,191
What a unique logic.

434
00:21:23,951 --> 00:21:25,151
But

435
00:21:26,191 --> 00:21:27,792
don't you feel trouble living like this?

436
00:21:28,631 --> 00:21:29,352
Compared to

437
00:21:29,352 --> 00:21:30,592
living a life with a place,

438
00:21:31,032 --> 00:21:31,992
the trouble is nothing.

439
00:21:40,231 --> 00:21:41,552
Why don't you kill him?

440
00:21:41,871 --> 00:21:42,391
He was just

441
00:21:42,391 --> 00:21:43,711
trying to eat me for survival

442
00:21:44,151 --> 00:21:45,871
but failed.

443
00:21:49,352 --> 00:21:50,592
I have some healing medicine here.

444
00:21:50,951 --> 00:21:53,231
Whether it works is up to you.

445
00:21:53,832 --> 00:21:54,951
After you left,

446
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,671
I checked that beastman.

447
00:21:56,911 --> 00:21:58,752
He had been severely injured before,

448
00:21:58,992 --> 00:21:59,832
so you did not

449
00:21:59,832 --> 00:22:00,911
kill him.

450
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:03,711
It's a long time ago.

451
00:22:04,471 --> 00:22:05,871
I've long since forgotten.

452
00:22:06,032 --> 00:22:06,911
Is that so?

453
00:22:07,272 --> 00:22:07,992
Then why did you

454
00:22:07,992 --> 00:22:09,312
show mercy at that time?

455
00:22:09,592 --> 00:22:11,391
After I knew your secret,

456
00:22:11,471 --> 00:22:12,792
why didn't you kill me?

457
00:22:12,992 --> 00:22:14,631
You clearly still have a conscience,

458
00:22:14,832 --> 00:22:15,752
but why do you pretend

459
00:22:15,752 --> 00:22:16,671
to be a bad man?

460
00:22:16,671 --> 00:22:17,512
Why?

461
00:22:19,112 --> 00:22:19,631
It's because

462
00:22:19,631 --> 00:22:20,992
Xueying forced me.

463
00:22:21,352 --> 00:22:22,671
I practiced so hard.

464
00:22:22,671 --> 00:22:23,911
Studied so hard.

465
00:22:24,312 --> 00:22:25,832
Just for the day

466
00:22:26,312 --> 00:22:26,832
when I can also

467
00:22:26,832 --> 00:22:28,871
become the protector
of the Dragon Mountain Empire.

468
00:22:29,631 --> 00:22:30,512
But what was the result?

469
00:22:31,231 --> 00:22:32,471
The teachers favored Xueying.

470
00:22:33,112 --> 00:22:34,312
They admired him so much

471
00:22:34,312 --> 00:22:35,752
and always gave him special treatment.

472
00:22:36,231 --> 00:22:37,711
The schoolmates admired him as well.

473
00:22:37,711 --> 00:22:38,312
They thought he was

474
00:22:38,312 --> 00:22:39,871
the pride of
the entire Changfeng Academy.

475
00:22:41,992 --> 00:22:43,552
Since Xueying is the hero,

476
00:22:43,992 --> 00:22:44,911
then I

477
00:22:45,911 --> 00:22:47,151
will be the bad guy.

478
00:22:48,112 --> 00:22:50,552
At least I can be a bad guy

479
00:22:50,871 --> 00:22:52,512
who defeats the hero.

480
00:22:52,631 --> 00:22:53,631
Situ Hong,

481
00:22:53,752 --> 00:22:55,112
you still have a choice.

482
00:22:56,471 --> 00:22:57,431
It's too late.

483
00:22:57,832 --> 00:22:58,671
It's not too late.

484
00:22:58,832 --> 00:23:01,032
Forget about righteous and Demon Clan.

485
00:23:01,191 --> 00:23:02,471
I'll accompany you to live in seclusion.

486
00:23:02,471 --> 00:23:03,272
Is that alright?

487
00:23:03,352 --> 00:23:04,112
Just pretend that all of this

488
00:23:04,112 --> 00:23:05,391
never happened.

489
00:23:11,871 --> 00:23:13,552
Hide your breath and body now.

490
00:23:20,671 --> 00:23:22,312
Second Priest.

491
00:23:22,832 --> 00:23:23,792
Tonight, the Demon God Association

492
00:23:23,792 --> 00:23:25,151
will hold a significant sacrifice.

493
00:23:25,512 --> 00:23:27,072
I want you to stand guard.

494
00:23:30,312 --> 00:23:32,151
According to our previous agreement,

495
00:23:32,391 --> 00:23:35,231
can you give me the Demon Clan's
secret technique now?

496
00:23:35,391 --> 00:23:37,352
I remember what I said was

497
00:23:37,512 --> 00:23:38,992
to kill Xueying

498
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:40,391
and I'll give you the secret technique.

499
00:23:40,911 --> 00:23:42,871
So did you kill Xueying?

500
00:23:44,072 --> 00:23:45,391
Why are you breaking your promise?

501
00:23:48,231 --> 00:23:49,312
Situ Hong,

502
00:23:49,911 --> 00:23:51,671
I've treated you with formality.

503
00:23:51,832 --> 00:23:53,711
You can refuse this task if you want.

504
00:23:53,871 --> 00:23:55,832
Then we will send you to Tiger City

505
00:23:55,992 --> 00:23:57,112
and let our most powerful

506
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:58,272
Demon General, Nuo Nuo An,

507
00:23:58,272 --> 00:23:59,512
that crazy old demon,

508
00:23:59,752 --> 00:24:01,112
torture you.

509
00:24:01,352 --> 00:24:02,231
How's that?

510
00:24:07,671 --> 00:24:08,792
Situ Hong,

511
00:24:09,352 --> 00:24:10,512
don't blame me.

512
00:24:10,711 --> 00:24:12,631
If you could be like Xueying,

513
00:24:13,552 --> 00:24:15,032
it wouldn't have come to this.

514
00:24:23,112 --> 00:24:24,792
Let's run away together.

515
00:24:24,951 --> 00:24:26,352
Forget about the sacrifice.

516
00:24:27,312 --> 00:24:28,951
I've already lost so much.

517
00:24:29,711 --> 00:24:31,112
If I leave now,

518
00:24:31,911 --> 00:24:32,992
I won't be able to accept it.

519
00:24:34,151 --> 00:24:35,032
And

520
00:24:35,512 --> 00:24:37,231
this is my last chance

521
00:24:37,231 --> 00:24:38,312
to defeat Dongbo Xueying.

522
00:24:38,391 --> 00:24:39,552
Situ Hong,

523
00:24:39,631 --> 00:24:41,272
can you wake up?

524
00:24:41,431 --> 00:24:43,151
That's the Demon Clan.

525
00:24:43,631 --> 00:24:44,951
Turn back.

526
00:24:45,711 --> 00:24:46,752
Turn back?

527
00:24:48,151 --> 00:24:49,512
How can someone like me

528
00:24:50,631 --> 00:24:52,032
turn back?

529
00:24:55,431 --> 00:24:57,272
I originally wanted to
make achievements,

530
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:00,112
but I didn't expect

531
00:25:01,151 --> 00:25:02,431
it would turn out like this.

532
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:05,191
From now on,

533
00:25:05,191 --> 00:25:06,471
you don't have to worry about me.

534
00:25:08,151 --> 00:25:09,832
I don't need anyone's sympathy.

535
00:25:17,431 --> 00:25:19,471
(I won't let you
make the same mistake again.)

536
00:25:34,752 --> 00:25:35,631
Second Priest,

537
00:25:35,871 --> 00:25:37,151
what are we doing here?

538
00:25:38,231 --> 00:25:40,191
Don't ask what you shouldn't.

539
00:25:40,671 --> 00:25:42,032
Keep quiet for a while.

540
00:25:42,391 --> 00:25:43,312
Lord Demon God

541
00:25:43,312 --> 00:25:44,992
is about to get down to business.

542
00:25:52,951 --> 00:25:54,231
It's time.

543
00:25:57,191 --> 00:25:59,112
Welcome, Great Demon God.

544
00:25:59,512 --> 00:26:02,112
Welcome, Great Demon God.

545
00:26:23,711 --> 00:26:25,512
Let's begin.

546
00:27:27,792 --> 00:27:30,431
The body of a god is indeed useful.

547
00:27:30,592 --> 00:27:31,832
The former Lord of Moxue Empire

548
00:27:31,832 --> 00:27:32,752
was regarded by the Xia Clan

549
00:27:32,752 --> 00:27:34,352
as their savior, wasn't he?

550
00:27:34,391 --> 00:27:36,391
Now let's use his physical body
with his divine power

551
00:27:36,391 --> 00:27:39,112
to help me recreate my body.

552
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:49,992
Dean?

553
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:53,752
How could it be?

554
00:27:54,951 --> 00:27:55,631
Ao Lan,

555
00:27:56,631 --> 00:27:57,752
what are you trying to do?

556
00:27:57,951 --> 00:27:59,312
You should be grateful

557
00:27:59,631 --> 00:28:02,231
that the remnants of Demon God
chose your body

558
00:28:02,512 --> 00:28:04,272
to mingle with you.

559
00:28:05,671 --> 00:28:06,992
Over my dead body.

560
00:28:08,471 --> 00:28:09,792
Stop struggling.

561
00:28:09,792 --> 00:28:12,272
Knight Changfeng, I told you

562
00:28:12,352 --> 00:28:14,752
Dragon Mountain Empire
will ultimately be ours.

563
00:28:15,312 --> 00:28:16,391
After tonight,

564
00:28:16,391 --> 00:28:17,711
the whole Dragon Mountain Empire

565
00:28:17,711 --> 00:28:19,352
will obey me.

566
00:28:19,552 --> 00:28:21,151
Even if I die,

567
00:28:21,832 --> 00:28:23,592
I won't let you succeed.

568
00:28:23,792 --> 00:28:25,911
That's not up to you.

569
00:28:25,911 --> 00:28:26,832
Let you try

570
00:28:26,832 --> 00:28:28,191
the taste of bursting demonic power.

571
00:28:43,752 --> 00:28:45,072
Chi Qiubai,

572
00:28:45,072 --> 00:28:46,391
stop struggling.

573
00:28:47,072 --> 00:28:47,992
Our energy cores

574
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:48,911
will eventually merge into one.

575
00:28:49,752 --> 00:28:51,112
In the future, you are me

576
00:28:51,552 --> 00:28:53,431
and I am you.

577
00:28:56,832 --> 00:28:57,671
Da Er Hao,

578
00:28:57,792 --> 00:29:00,231
the power of Demon God will be weakened
by the will of Dragon Mountain.

579
00:29:05,992 --> 00:29:07,231
You miscalculated it.

580
00:29:07,631 --> 00:29:10,512
Ao Lan, I need strength.

581
00:29:17,032 --> 00:29:17,951
Situ Hong,

582
00:29:18,191 --> 00:29:19,871
it's time to show your loyalty.

583
00:29:20,272 --> 00:29:22,752
Give all your power to Great Demon God.

584
00:29:44,231 --> 00:29:45,191
Why are you here?

585
00:29:45,352 --> 00:29:46,951
If you didn't leave with me,
I would come.

586
00:29:46,951 --> 00:29:47,951
Fortunately, I came.

587
00:29:47,951 --> 00:29:48,512
Otherwise, you would be

588
00:29:48,512 --> 00:29:49,752
a sacrifice to the Demon Clan.

589
00:30:07,871 --> 00:30:08,871
Chi Qiubai,

590
00:30:08,871 --> 00:30:09,871
a god is a god.

591
00:30:10,312 --> 00:30:11,512
You just need to obey.

592
00:31:00,512 --> 00:31:01,151
Zhuo Yi,

593
00:31:06,391 --> 00:31:07,592
why are you so silly?

594
00:31:08,112 --> 00:31:08,631
Didn't I tell you

595
00:31:08,631 --> 00:31:10,032
to never follow me?

596
00:31:13,871 --> 00:31:15,151
Go with me.

597
00:31:27,671 --> 00:31:28,592
I think

598
00:31:30,951 --> 00:31:32,272
we can't escape.

599
00:31:32,792 --> 00:31:33,711
Let's become

600
00:31:33,711 --> 00:31:35,112
the protectors of
Dragon Mountain Empire together.

601
00:31:35,711 --> 00:31:36,471
Great.

602
00:31:38,151 --> 00:31:40,231
We can't let the Demon Clan succeed.

603
00:31:45,312 --> 00:31:45,992
Wait for me.

604
00:32:43,471 --> 00:32:45,792
Zhuo Yi, wait for me.

605
00:33:12,992 --> 00:33:13,871
Master.

606
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:22,752
Our show is about to begin.

607
00:33:23,231 --> 00:33:23,911
Master,

608
00:33:24,592 --> 00:33:26,151
you've finally succeeded.

609
00:33:28,151 --> 00:33:29,151
Screw it.

610
00:33:30,312 --> 00:33:31,151
If it weren't for

611
00:33:31,151 --> 00:33:32,671
being interrupted by that stupid woman,

612
00:33:33,792 --> 00:33:34,911
I could have completely erased

613
00:33:34,911 --> 00:33:36,231
Chi Qiubai's consciousness.

614
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:38,391
But it doesn't matter.

615
00:33:40,032 --> 00:33:41,352
His energy core

616
00:33:42,231 --> 00:33:44,072
has already been sealed inside me.

617
00:33:44,072 --> 00:33:45,512
You are wise, Master.

618
00:33:46,832 --> 00:33:47,671
Go.

619
00:33:47,992 --> 00:33:49,552
Bring Nuo Nuo An to me.

620
00:33:50,272 --> 00:33:52,312
It's time to let her do something.

621
00:33:52,471 --> 00:33:54,191
She's been waiting for a long time.

622
00:33:57,832 --> 00:33:59,431
Dragon Mountain Empire,

623
00:34:00,191 --> 00:34:01,671
I'm back.

624
00:34:03,711 --> 00:34:04,992
No one

625
00:34:04,992 --> 00:34:07,752
can stop me anymore.

626
00:34:35,791 --> 00:34:37,191
General Nuo Nuo An,

627
00:34:37,631 --> 00:34:38,992
I hope you are doing well.

628
00:34:39,351 --> 00:34:41,032
I've become more beautiful.

629
00:34:41,072 --> 00:34:42,791
Didn't you notice?

630
00:34:44,191 --> 00:34:45,952
Forgive my carelessness.

631
00:34:46,992 --> 00:34:48,432
But you said before

632
00:34:48,432 --> 00:34:49,912
you have many subordinates.

633
00:34:50,191 --> 00:34:51,351
Where are they?

634
00:34:51,512 --> 00:34:52,671
Right here.

635
00:34:53,112 --> 00:34:54,912
There are only corpses here.

636
00:34:55,151 --> 00:34:56,472
Where is the army?

637
00:35:03,191 --> 00:35:04,952
They are my puppet army.

638
00:35:04,952 --> 00:35:06,791
They have been drugged by me.

639
00:35:06,952 --> 00:35:08,631
Their consciousness
can be manipulated by me at will.

640
00:35:08,711 --> 00:35:10,231
When the critical moment comes,

641
00:35:10,311 --> 00:35:11,831
they will become an army

642
00:35:11,912 --> 00:35:13,311
without their own thoughts.

643
00:35:13,392 --> 00:35:15,512
Obedient to my command

644
00:35:15,671 --> 00:35:18,392
and fearless of war.

645
00:35:18,831 --> 00:35:20,671
But won't their strange faces

646
00:35:20,791 --> 00:35:22,472
be easily exposed?

647
00:35:23,032 --> 00:35:24,072
Don't worry.

648
00:35:24,112 --> 00:35:25,671
I have set up a blinding spell

649
00:35:25,671 --> 00:35:26,872
on the roads around.

650
00:35:27,112 --> 00:35:28,671
People inside can't get out

651
00:35:28,831 --> 00:35:31,112
and people outside can't get in.

652
00:35:31,112 --> 00:35:32,191
Very clever.

653
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:33,791
Master said

654
00:35:33,831 --> 00:35:34,791
you are

655
00:35:34,791 --> 00:35:36,032
the most powerful general
of our Demon Clan.

656
00:35:36,311 --> 00:35:37,872
You really live up to your reputation.

657
00:35:39,711 --> 00:35:41,631
I have more tricks,

658
00:35:41,631 --> 00:35:42,432
even more clever.

659
00:35:42,432 --> 00:35:43,392
Do you want to

660
00:35:44,112 --> 00:35:45,512
go and check with me?

661
00:35:45,751 --> 00:35:47,231
Not today.

662
00:35:47,631 --> 00:35:49,112
Master needs you urgently.

663
00:35:49,472 --> 00:35:51,351
I think business is more important.

664
00:35:52,552 --> 00:35:53,432
Okay.

665
00:35:54,072 --> 00:35:56,631
Then let's make a deal.

666
00:35:57,112 --> 00:35:58,912
I will treat you well next time.

667
00:36:20,231 --> 00:36:21,791
When did our Demon God Association

668
00:36:21,992 --> 00:36:24,191
have such a beautiful person?

669
00:36:30,512 --> 00:36:31,631
I was rude.

670
00:36:31,751 --> 00:36:33,432
Please forgive me, Lord Demon God.

671
00:36:33,831 --> 00:36:37,791
How's the collection of Dou Qi going?

672
00:36:43,072 --> 00:36:43,992
Lord Demon God,

673
00:36:44,151 --> 00:36:46,072
this is the sixth crystal

674
00:36:46,072 --> 00:36:47,311
filled with Dou Qi.

675
00:36:47,392 --> 00:36:50,151
I will make it with only four more.

676
00:36:50,512 --> 00:36:51,711
Speed up.

677
00:36:51,711 --> 00:36:52,271
Yes.

678
00:36:52,552 --> 00:36:54,432
But if we collect

679
00:36:54,432 --> 00:36:55,512
so much Dou Qi at once,

680
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:56,711
it's easy

681
00:36:56,711 --> 00:36:58,351
to alert the righteous.

682
00:36:58,552 --> 00:37:00,351
They have no leader now.

683
00:37:00,791 --> 00:37:02,231
What can they do

684
00:37:02,472 --> 00:37:03,671
if we raise the alarm?

685
00:37:04,032 --> 00:37:05,112
I would like to know

686
00:37:05,592 --> 00:37:06,791
what you are collecting

687
00:37:06,791 --> 00:37:09,912
so much Dou Qi for.

688
00:37:11,631 --> 00:37:14,512
Ever heard of Six-pointed Star Fortress?

689
00:37:15,112 --> 00:37:16,112
Of course.

690
00:37:16,432 --> 00:37:17,912
This is the most evil instrument

691
00:37:18,271 --> 00:37:19,952
within the three realms.

692
00:37:20,151 --> 00:37:21,631
It can control everything

693
00:37:21,631 --> 00:37:23,311
in its super large barrier.

694
00:37:23,631 --> 00:37:24,351
So...

695
00:37:24,512 --> 00:37:25,631
Exactly,

696
00:37:25,831 --> 00:37:28,472
the Six-pointed Star Fortress is evil

697
00:37:28,671 --> 00:37:30,751
because it has collected

698
00:37:30,751 --> 00:37:31,952
so much Dou Qi.

699
00:37:32,271 --> 00:37:33,432
The more Dou Qi it has,

700
00:37:33,592 --> 00:37:34,992
the bigger and more robust

701
00:37:35,072 --> 00:37:37,631
the barrier it forms.

702
00:37:38,032 --> 00:37:38,552
So,

703
00:37:38,552 --> 00:37:40,191
you've collected so much Dou Qi.

704
00:37:40,711 --> 00:37:41,592
How large of a barrier

705
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,032
are you planning to build?

706
00:37:43,592 --> 00:37:46,512
The size of Xueying Territory
or the one of Yishui City?

707
00:37:46,671 --> 00:37:48,191
The one I, Nuo Nuo An, want to build

708
00:37:48,432 --> 00:37:50,151
is naturally the largest.

709
00:37:50,552 --> 00:37:52,592
A Six-pointed Star Fortress
that can control

710
00:37:52,592 --> 00:37:53,711
the entire Dragon Mountain Empire.

711
00:37:53,912 --> 00:37:55,992
When the Six-pointed Star Fortress

712
00:37:55,992 --> 00:37:57,751
covers the Dragon Mountain Empire,

713
00:37:57,952 --> 00:37:59,831
I will connect it to our abyss.

714
00:38:00,072 --> 00:38:01,791
As long as the fortress
remains unbroken,

715
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:02,992
our power

716
00:38:03,112 --> 00:38:05,392
can continue connecting to the fortress

717
00:38:05,592 --> 00:38:06,912
through the channel.

718
00:38:07,072 --> 00:38:08,351
Then at that time,

719
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:09,671
won't the entire Dragon Mountain Empire

720
00:38:09,671 --> 00:38:11,191
be like fish in our bucket?

721
00:38:11,191 --> 00:38:12,592
We can play with it

722
00:38:12,992 --> 00:38:14,072
however we want.

723
00:38:14,072 --> 00:38:14,912
Alright,

724
00:38:15,231 --> 00:38:17,151
since you already know the plan,

725
00:38:17,512 --> 00:38:18,992
take action immediately.

726
00:38:19,631 --> 00:38:20,872
Before the Six-pointed Star Fortress

727
00:38:20,872 --> 00:38:22,112
is established,

728
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:24,791
keep a low profile

729
00:38:25,671 --> 00:38:27,351
in case of unnecessary complications.

730
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:29,072
Yes.

731
00:38:30,032 --> 00:38:30,872
Go.

732
00:38:37,229 --> 00:38:39,366
(Elders' Hall)

733
00:38:41,831 --> 00:38:42,552
Get ready.

734
00:38:42,552 --> 00:38:43,472
They might arrive soon.

735
00:38:43,472 --> 00:38:43,952
Yes.

736
00:38:43,952 --> 00:38:44,671
Wu Cang,

737
00:38:45,392 --> 00:38:46,231
look at this.

738
00:38:46,351 --> 00:38:47,351
It's a message sent by Zhuo Yi

739
00:38:47,351 --> 00:38:48,392
using an emergency dispatch.

740
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:54,695
(Tiger City has anomalies.)

741
00:38:55,631 --> 00:38:56,432
Anomalies?

742
00:38:56,472 --> 00:38:57,552
So haste.

743
00:38:57,912 --> 00:38:59,631
It shows how urgent the situation was.

744
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,472
I hope Zhuo Yi is alright.

745
00:39:01,472 --> 00:39:03,072
Zhuo Yi is much smarter than you.

746
00:39:03,072 --> 00:39:04,191
What could happen to her?

747
00:39:04,952 --> 00:39:06,351
But what should we do

748
00:39:06,351 --> 00:39:07,271
with Tiger City?

749
00:39:08,872 --> 00:39:10,271
Although we are short of forces,

750
00:39:10,831 --> 00:39:12,432
we still have to go and check it out.

751
00:39:12,711 --> 00:39:14,992
Okay, I will go and prepare now.

752
00:39:19,472 --> 00:39:20,271
(Xueying,)

753
00:39:21,072 --> 00:39:22,191
(please come back soon.)

754
00:39:34,811 --> 00:39:36,056
(True Meaning of Ice Breaking)

755
00:39:42,928 --> 00:39:45,436
(True Meaning of Visionary Kill)

756
00:39:50,936 --> 00:39:53,225
(True Meaning of Shadow Blade)

757
00:39:55,831 --> 00:39:56,592
Jingqiu.

758
00:39:59,912 --> 00:40:01,631
Jingqiu, the Snow Phantom Spell

759
00:40:01,631 --> 00:40:02,711
given by Lord of Red Stone Mountain

760
00:40:02,751 --> 00:40:04,072
is quite effective
in healing damaged pulse,

761
00:40:04,072 --> 00:40:05,392
isn't it?

762
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:06,952
I feel much better now.

763
00:40:07,032 --> 00:40:08,032
This secret manual has helped me

764
00:40:08,032 --> 00:40:09,552
to cultivate
the True Meaning of Ice Breaking.

765
00:40:09,711 --> 00:40:10,791
I now have enough power

766
00:40:10,791 --> 00:40:12,392
to fight against
Great Demon God with you.

767
00:40:12,392 --> 00:40:14,392
Now we are just waiting for
Xueying to come back.

768
00:40:14,592 --> 00:40:15,392
That's great.

769
00:40:21,472 --> 00:40:22,631
What are you doing?

770
00:40:23,751 --> 00:40:24,151
This is

771
00:40:24,151 --> 00:40:25,631
the secret signal
between Xueying and me.

772
00:40:25,912 --> 00:40:26,992
As soon as I knock,

773
00:40:26,992 --> 00:40:28,472
he will feel it over there.

774
00:40:28,671 --> 00:40:29,872
So, Xueying

775
00:40:29,872 --> 00:40:31,271
can feel it too, right?

776
00:40:31,351 --> 00:40:33,631
He said no matter where he is,

777
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,151
as long as I knock on the secret signal,

778
00:40:35,151 --> 00:40:36,271
he will do his best

779
00:40:36,271 --> 00:40:37,032
to rush back.

780
00:40:37,711 --> 00:40:39,552
But what if he...

781
00:40:39,552 --> 00:40:40,472
There are no ifs.

782
00:40:40,791 --> 00:40:42,472
Xueying will definitely come back.

783
00:40:56,191 --> 00:40:57,191
What happened?

784
00:40:57,432 --> 00:40:57,912
I just received

785
00:40:57,912 --> 00:40:58,952
a message from Wu Cang,

786
00:40:59,032 --> 00:41:00,552
requesting support for Tiger City.

787
00:41:01,032 --> 00:41:02,512
Wu Cang is usually very calm.

788
00:41:02,552 --> 00:41:03,751
If it weren't for a serious incident,

789
00:41:03,751 --> 00:41:05,271
he wouldn't ask for help so urgently.

790
00:41:06,351 --> 00:41:07,592
You guys go back first.

791
00:41:07,952 --> 00:41:09,472
I will stay here and wait for Xueying.

792
00:41:09,592 --> 00:41:10,472
No matter how long it takes,

793
00:41:10,472 --> 00:41:11,751
I will wait for him to come back.

794
00:41:18,671 --> 00:41:20,472
(This is the life I yearn for.)

795
00:41:21,392 --> 00:41:24,271
(Family sitting around
with warm lights.)

796
00:41:25,072 --> 00:41:25,992
(Under every light)

797
00:41:25,992 --> 00:41:27,432
(in the Dragon Mountain Continent)

798
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:29,671
(is a harmonious and happy family.)

799
00:41:31,151 --> 00:41:32,631
(But I can't stay here.)

800
00:41:33,512 --> 00:41:35,072
(The Demon Clan is watching closely now)

801
00:41:35,392 --> 00:41:36,791
(and the Xia Clan
is in imminent danger.)

802
00:41:37,671 --> 00:41:39,311
(I want all the Xia Clan compatriots)

803
00:41:39,992 --> 00:41:41,032
(to live this yearned-for life)

804
00:41:41,032 --> 00:41:42,592
(under the sun,)

805
00:41:43,512 --> 00:41:44,952
(but not just me)

806
00:41:45,912 --> 00:41:46,912
(enjoying the joy of family)

807
00:41:46,912 --> 00:41:48,271
(in the paradise.)

808
00:41:50,151 --> 00:41:51,271
Xueying,

809
00:41:51,952 --> 00:41:53,392
for the first time,

810
00:41:53,472 --> 00:41:54,151
I feel so warm

811
00:41:54,151 --> 00:41:55,351
without my family.

812
00:41:56,351 --> 00:41:58,791
Haven't you heard anything
about your family yet?

813
00:42:00,311 --> 00:42:02,032
Even Dragon Mountain Mansion,
which knows all the information,

814
00:42:02,032 --> 00:42:03,552
can't find anything.

815
00:42:06,072 --> 00:42:07,112
As long as you don't give up,

816
00:42:07,432 --> 00:42:08,791
there will definitely be a chance.

817
00:42:09,512 --> 00:42:11,472
Actually, I've gradually accepted it.

818
00:42:11,671 --> 00:42:12,711
Over these years,

819
00:42:12,711 --> 00:42:14,351
I've lived in Water Daoist Temple.

820
00:42:14,552 --> 00:42:16,392
My master and my seniors

821
00:42:16,392 --> 00:42:17,512
have all been very kind to me.

822
00:42:17,751 --> 00:42:19,311
Now I've met you.

823
00:42:19,592 --> 00:42:21,831
You could escape death

824
00:42:21,831 --> 00:42:23,191
after falling off the Black Wind Cliff

825
00:42:23,311 --> 00:42:24,631
and I can still see you again.

826
00:42:25,072 --> 00:42:26,552
I feel very fortunate.

827
00:42:26,872 --> 00:42:28,472
I feel the same.

828
00:42:29,751 --> 00:42:30,512
Jingqiu.

829
00:42:32,231 --> 00:42:33,231
We will

830
00:42:33,231 --> 00:42:34,351
reunite with our families soon.

831
00:42:41,671 --> 00:42:42,952
What are you thinking about?

832
00:42:43,311 --> 00:42:44,512
It's time to turn off the lights.

833
00:42:45,912 --> 00:42:46,791
Nothing.

834
00:42:47,072 --> 00:42:48,432
Just suddenly remembered something.

835
00:42:49,952 --> 00:42:50,831
Go to sleep first.

836
00:42:51,751 --> 00:42:54,191
Xueying, where are you going?

837
00:42:54,872 --> 00:42:56,512
I can't deceive myself anymore.

838
00:42:56,751 --> 00:42:57,912
I don't belong here.

839
00:42:58,151 --> 00:42:59,032
I need to go back.

840
00:42:59,072 --> 00:43:00,751
What do you mean here and there?

841
00:43:01,791 --> 00:43:03,072
I don't want you to leave.

842
00:43:05,711 --> 00:43:06,432
I'm sorry.

843
00:43:09,711 --> 00:43:11,271
I wanted everything here,

844
00:43:12,432 --> 00:43:13,631
but you are not her.

845
00:43:14,952 --> 00:43:16,271
In another world,

846
00:43:16,791 --> 00:43:17,552
she is willing to

847
00:43:17,552 --> 00:43:18,912
fight alongside me.

848
00:43:19,872 --> 00:43:21,151
As well as my companions.

849
00:43:21,831 --> 00:43:23,231
And the Dragon Mountain Continent.

850
00:43:25,952 --> 00:43:27,231
I can't leave them behind.

851
00:43:28,032 --> 00:43:29,191
I must go back.

852
00:43:29,711 --> 00:43:31,191
Xueying, don't be foolish.

853
00:43:31,791 --> 00:43:33,311
You can't leave at all.
