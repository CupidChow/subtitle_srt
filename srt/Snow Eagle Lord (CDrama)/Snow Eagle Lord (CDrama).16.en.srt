00:01:46,907 --> 00:01:47,987
Xueying,

22
00:01:48,067 --> 00:01:48,668
I just found out

23
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:50,067
that was your mother.

24
00:01:50,188 --> 00:01:52,028
We've been there once
and have some experience.

25
00:01:52,147 --> 00:01:53,668
Let us go with you.

26
00:01:54,267 --> 00:01:54,907
No.

27
00:01:55,067 --> 00:01:55,828
It's too dangerous.

28
00:01:56,188 --> 00:01:58,228
Xueying, let me go with you.

29
00:01:58,267 --> 00:01:59,427
If you go alone,

30
00:01:59,427 --> 00:02:00,427
I'll be worried about you.

31
00:02:01,468 --> 00:02:02,748
Thank you, Jingqiu.

32
00:02:02,868 --> 00:02:03,787
But...

33
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:14,067
Let me go with you.

34
00:02:15,507 --> 00:02:16,148
Youyue.

35
00:02:21,748 --> 00:02:22,507
What's wrong?

36
00:02:22,708 --> 00:02:23,428
Look.

37
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:24,548
Actually,

38
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:26,028
you're quite nice to me.

39
00:02:26,708 --> 00:02:28,387
Am I?

40
00:02:28,667 --> 00:02:29,468
Yes.

41
00:02:29,667 --> 00:02:30,947
Only I can see

42
00:02:31,028 --> 00:02:32,227
your angry face.

43
00:02:32,347 --> 00:02:33,548
Isn't that my privilege?

44
00:02:35,507 --> 00:02:36,947
It seems so.

45
00:02:49,308 --> 00:02:50,827
(It's been five days since I returned,)

46
00:02:51,148 --> 00:02:52,787
(but I haven't found anything.)

47
00:02:53,827 --> 00:02:54,988
(Once my injury is healed,)

48
00:02:55,188 --> 00:02:56,667
(there'll be no reason to stay.)

49
00:02:57,308 --> 00:02:57,907
(No way.)

50
00:02:58,387 --> 00:02:59,708
(I must seize the time.)

51
00:03:01,067 --> 00:03:02,148
(What places)

52
00:03:02,148 --> 00:03:03,507
(haven't I searched yet?)

53
00:03:07,507 --> 00:03:09,067
Could it be there?

54
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:20,627
(Lord of Xueying Territory,
Dongbo Lie's Tomb)

55
00:03:20,627 --> 00:03:22,588
Dongbo Lie's Tomb.

56
00:03:24,067 --> 00:03:25,028
(After the lunar eclipse,)

57
00:03:25,028 --> 00:03:26,627
(the first ray of sunlight)

58
00:03:27,028 --> 00:03:28,627
(will show us the weakest spot)

59
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:29,548
(connecting the three realms.)

60
00:03:30,227 --> 00:03:31,787
(The Earth's crust
is the thinnest there,)

61
00:03:31,947 --> 00:03:33,947
(and the temperature is higher
than the surrounding environment.)

62
00:03:34,308 --> 00:03:35,387
(That place)

63
00:03:35,588 --> 00:03:36,868
(is in the Xueying Territory)

64
00:03:37,067 --> 00:03:38,827
(where we can create the Demon Well.)

65
00:03:39,268 --> 00:03:40,868
Could it be here?

66
00:04:06,428 --> 00:04:08,868
(Help the Demon Clan
enter the Xueying Territory.)

67
00:04:16,507 --> 00:04:18,147
Recently, I've felt that those soldiers

68
00:04:18,147 --> 00:04:19,228
are a bit off,

69
00:04:19,788 --> 00:04:20,868
but I can't figure out

70
00:04:20,868 --> 00:04:21,827
what's wrong exactly.

71
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,136
(Hui An)

72
00:04:32,668 --> 00:04:34,188
Xiong Qi!

73
00:04:35,387 --> 00:04:36,267
I'm here!

74
00:04:38,188 --> 00:04:38,827
Commander.

75
00:04:39,267 --> 00:04:40,228
What's going on?

76
00:04:41,947 --> 00:04:43,387
I-I-It's like this, Commander.

77
00:04:43,387 --> 00:04:44,067
A few days ago,

78
00:04:44,067 --> 00:04:45,228
some soldiers asked for leave

79
00:04:45,228 --> 00:04:46,507
and we didn't have enough manpower,

80
00:04:46,668 --> 00:04:48,228
so I got a few fellow villagers here.

81
00:04:48,707 --> 00:04:49,467
Ridiculous.

82
00:04:51,147 --> 00:04:51,827
Xiong Qi,

83
00:04:52,348 --> 00:04:54,108
you've been in the Xueying territory
for a long time.

84
00:04:54,267 --> 00:04:55,428
You know the rules

85
00:04:55,428 --> 00:04:56,348
of the army very well.

86
00:04:56,587 --> 00:04:57,308
Even though they wanted
to ask for leave,

87
00:04:57,308 --> 00:04:58,428
they still needed to report in advance.

88
00:04:58,827 --> 00:05:00,627
He's not unreasonable.

89
00:05:00,868 --> 00:05:01,428
What's worse,

90
00:05:01,707 --> 00:05:03,147
you even replaced a few soldiers
without permission.

91
00:05:03,627 --> 00:05:04,387
This is forbidden

92
00:05:04,387 --> 00:05:05,548
in the territory.

93
00:05:07,228 --> 00:05:07,868
Commander,

94
00:05:07,988 --> 00:05:09,147
I thought it was a small matter

95
00:05:09,228 --> 00:05:10,267
and didn't want to bother you.

96
00:05:10,267 --> 00:05:10,868
And

97
00:05:10,868 --> 00:05:12,067
I was afraid you would get mad

98
00:05:12,067 --> 00:05:13,308
at the leave-taking ones,

99
00:05:13,308 --> 00:05:14,788
so I made my own decision.

100
00:05:14,788 --> 00:05:15,387
I will

101
00:05:15,387 --> 00:05:15,947
- You...
- send them back

102
00:05:15,947 --> 00:05:16,788
right away.

103
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:18,387
What makes you

104
00:05:18,387 --> 00:05:20,067
so angry this early morning,
Uncle Tong San?

105
00:05:20,467 --> 00:05:22,308
Xiong Qi replaced

106
00:05:22,348 --> 00:05:23,507
a few soldiers who went home on leave

107
00:05:23,507 --> 00:05:24,507
without reporting.

108
00:05:25,908 --> 00:05:26,908
No wonder Uncle Tong San

109
00:05:26,908 --> 00:05:27,988
is so angry.

110
00:05:28,147 --> 00:05:29,188
Replacing soldiers without permission

111
00:05:29,188 --> 00:05:30,147
is not allowed.

112
00:05:30,827 --> 00:05:32,267
Uncle Tong San
is a strict disciplinarian.

113
00:05:32,267 --> 00:05:33,668
The soldiers were afraid
of being punished,

114
00:05:33,668 --> 00:05:35,147
so they dared not report.

115
00:05:35,548 --> 00:05:36,228
Next time

116
00:05:36,228 --> 00:05:37,507
you encounter such a thing,

117
00:05:37,627 --> 00:05:38,587
you must report

118
00:05:38,668 --> 00:05:39,548
to the commander immediately.

119
00:05:40,348 --> 00:05:41,988
Yes. I was wrong.

120
00:05:42,668 --> 00:05:43,548
Uncle Tong San,

121
00:05:43,908 --> 00:05:45,587
I made butterfly pastries

122
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,748
and beef porridge this morning.

123
00:05:46,827 --> 00:05:47,788
Let's go eat together later.

124
00:05:47,788 --> 00:05:48,587
They are delicious.

125
00:06:09,348 --> 00:06:10,067
Miss Ji Rong,

126
00:06:10,308 --> 00:06:10,908
are you alright?

127
00:06:11,988 --> 00:06:13,467
My foot hurts so much.

128
00:06:13,748 --> 00:06:14,827
The snow here

129
00:06:14,827 --> 00:06:15,668
gets especially thick

130
00:06:15,668 --> 00:06:16,548
in winter,

131
00:06:16,788 --> 00:06:18,067
and people would easily
sprain their feet.

132
00:06:18,428 --> 00:06:20,067
It's not good if you hurt your bones.

133
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,387
Ouch, ouch.

134
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:23,467
Let me help you get back.

135
00:06:25,348 --> 00:06:27,228
Thank you, Xiong Qi.

136
00:06:28,707 --> 00:06:29,668
I can't take this money.

137
00:06:29,668 --> 00:06:30,827
It's just common decency.

138
00:06:30,908 --> 00:06:31,587
You don't even know

139
00:06:31,587 --> 00:06:33,108
what I want you to do yet.

140
00:06:37,947 --> 00:06:38,827
No way.

141
00:06:38,827 --> 00:06:39,707
This is impossible.

142
00:06:39,707 --> 00:06:41,067
Take it back.

143
00:06:43,387 --> 00:06:44,348
Don't worry.

144
00:06:44,428 --> 00:06:46,067
I won't cause you trouble.

145
00:06:46,228 --> 00:06:47,627
Just do a little thing

146
00:06:47,627 --> 00:06:49,348
and all this money will be yours.

147
00:06:49,587 --> 00:06:51,188
And no one will know.

148
00:06:51,627 --> 00:06:53,387
Even if someone finds out,

149
00:06:53,587 --> 00:06:55,228
I'll surely get you off the hook.

150
00:06:55,548 --> 00:06:57,228
Otherwise, I will be found too.

151
00:07:04,027 --> 00:07:05,027
If you're unwilling

152
00:07:05,027 --> 00:07:06,348
to become friends with me,

153
00:07:06,868 --> 00:07:07,507
I'll have no choice

154
00:07:07,507 --> 00:07:08,827
but to make you my enemy.

155
00:07:09,387 --> 00:07:10,788
Look at your posture.

156
00:07:10,788 --> 00:07:12,027
What must they think of you?

157
00:07:12,308 --> 00:07:14,668
If I yell and draw out all the people

158
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:15,788
in the Snow Stone Fort,

159
00:07:15,788 --> 00:07:16,827
including Qingshi and Tong San,

160
00:07:17,108 --> 00:07:18,908
do you think they'll believe you

161
00:07:19,188 --> 00:07:19,868
or a weak woman

162
00:07:19,947 --> 00:07:21,267
like me?

163
00:07:24,188 --> 00:07:25,267
Relax.

164
00:07:25,267 --> 00:07:26,308
It's just a small favor.

165
00:07:26,308 --> 00:07:27,827
You won't lose anything.

166
00:07:28,267 --> 00:07:30,108
But if you make me unhappy,

167
00:07:30,147 --> 00:07:31,707
you and your family

168
00:07:31,707 --> 00:07:32,868
will be like you are now,

169
00:07:32,868 --> 00:07:34,228
unable to move.

170
00:07:37,147 --> 00:07:38,668
(Don't even think about reporting me.)

171
00:07:39,308 --> 00:07:40,627
(Otherwise, I'll make your family)

172
00:07:40,627 --> 00:07:42,348
(disappear like a wisp of smoke.)

173
00:07:44,467 --> 00:07:45,267
Puyang.

174
00:07:46,741 --> 00:07:47,952
(Academic Performance Ranking)

175
00:07:49,868 --> 00:07:51,908
Dongbo Xueying's ranking is so high.

176
00:07:52,067 --> 00:07:53,027
Of course.

177
00:07:53,027 --> 00:07:54,027
Even if there are few spots

178
00:07:54,108 --> 00:07:54,827
in the Transcendent Trial,

179
00:07:54,988 --> 00:07:56,428
(Dongbo Xueying)
with a ranking like this,

180
00:07:56,507 --> 00:07:57,748
he will definitely be able
to participate.

181
00:07:58,748 --> 00:07:59,387
Youyue,

182
00:07:59,548 --> 00:08:01,947
actually, my ranking is not bad.

183
00:08:02,428 --> 00:08:03,587
Where is it?

184
00:08:04,147 --> 00:08:04,507
Here.

185
00:08:04,707 --> 00:08:05,387
Here it is.

186
00:08:05,387 --> 00:08:06,228
Below, below.

187
00:08:06,228 --> 00:08:06,908
Below there.

188
00:08:06,908 --> 00:08:08,868
(I'm so far behind Dongbo Xueying.)

189
00:08:10,827 --> 00:08:12,467
First, circulate your energy
before wielding the spear.

190
00:08:19,067 --> 00:08:21,027
Focus on the Divine Qi Acupoint.

191
00:08:50,188 --> 00:08:51,467
(It is said that Knight Changfeng)

192
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:53,028
(gave Dongbo Xueying
individual guidance,)

193
00:08:53,268 --> 00:08:54,747
(so he made rapid progress.)

194
00:08:54,987 --> 00:08:56,508
(So it's true.)

195
00:09:02,107 --> 00:09:02,827
Xueying,

196
00:09:03,188 --> 00:09:04,548
you've made more progress
than I thought.

197
00:09:04,788 --> 00:09:06,428
Given time, you'll surely become great.

198
00:09:10,428 --> 00:09:11,188
Master,

199
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:12,428
I've cultivated

200
00:09:12,428 --> 00:09:13,668
Transcendent Dou Qi,

201
00:09:14,148 --> 00:09:15,668
but I feel my spear technique
is still far behind.

202
00:09:16,028 --> 00:09:17,668
Compared with the mysteries
of the universe,

203
00:09:17,747 --> 00:09:19,107
my spear technique is really crude.

204
00:09:19,428 --> 00:09:20,508
It's not worth mentioning.

205
00:09:20,747 --> 00:09:22,028
You're being too modest.

206
00:09:22,388 --> 00:09:23,347
I want to practice more.

207
00:09:23,788 --> 00:09:24,268
Okay.

208
00:09:28,268 --> 00:09:28,908
Master,

209
00:09:36,508 --> 00:09:38,508
during my training today,

210
00:09:38,508 --> 00:09:39,188
I found

211
00:09:39,188 --> 00:09:40,227
many issues that were bothering me.

212
00:09:40,308 --> 00:09:41,707
May I ask you for guidance in person?

213
00:09:42,628 --> 00:09:43,388
I saw

214
00:09:43,388 --> 00:09:44,188
the move you taught Xueying just now,

215
00:09:44,188 --> 00:09:45,707
and it looks powerful.

216
00:09:45,987 --> 00:09:46,788
Can I get

217
00:09:46,947 --> 00:09:48,628
the same instruction

218
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:50,148
you gave him?

219
00:09:50,428 --> 00:09:51,947
I know you're eager to be stronger

220
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:54,347
and participate in
Transcendent Battle of Life and Death.

221
00:09:55,067 --> 00:09:56,628
But the move I taught Xueying

222
00:09:56,628 --> 00:09:57,668
is what he can control

223
00:09:57,668 --> 00:09:58,428
with his strength.

224
00:09:58,428 --> 00:09:59,827
But with your current strength,

225
00:09:59,827 --> 00:10:00,947
I'm afraid
you won't be able to master it.

226
00:10:01,628 --> 00:10:03,827
Don't be impatient
when practicing martial arts.

227
00:10:07,188 --> 00:10:08,347
I understand.

228
00:10:13,268 --> 00:10:15,067
(Even our master favors him.)

229
00:10:15,188 --> 00:10:16,428
(Dongbo Xueying,)

230
00:10:16,628 --> 00:10:18,347
(I was number one
when entering Changfeng Academy,)

231
00:10:18,388 --> 00:10:19,707
(and I will still be in the future.)

232
00:10:19,908 --> 00:10:20,508
(What's so great about you relying on)

233
00:10:20,508 --> 00:10:22,067
(our master's guidance)

234
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,668
(and special attention?)

235
00:10:24,428 --> 00:10:26,268
(I'll surpass you on my own.)

236
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,188
(I'll never lose.)

237
00:10:29,611 --> 00:10:31,783
(Library)

238
00:10:48,777 --> 00:10:50,000
(Tan)

239
00:10:50,148 --> 00:10:51,028
Ms. Tanshi.

240
00:10:53,908 --> 00:10:55,227
What's wrong?

241
00:10:55,227 --> 00:10:56,827
My family chronicle

242
00:10:56,867 --> 00:10:58,067
was accidentally damaged.

243
00:10:58,188 --> 00:10:59,987
I heard that your restoration skills

244
00:10:59,987 --> 00:11:00,788
are quite amazing.

245
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,987
Could you help me restore it?

246
00:11:02,987 --> 00:11:04,408
(Si Family Chronicle)

247
00:11:05,587 --> 00:11:06,747
Si Family Chronicle?

248
00:11:06,788 --> 00:11:07,347
That's right.

249
00:11:12,827 --> 00:11:14,548
What a pity. Such a good book.

250
00:11:15,067 --> 00:11:16,467
It records the history of your family

251
00:11:16,467 --> 00:11:17,628
but is mostly damaged.

252
00:11:17,908 --> 00:11:19,148
Restoring it

253
00:11:19,227 --> 00:11:20,788
might take quite some time.

254
00:11:21,308 --> 00:11:22,067
That's fine,

255
00:11:22,107 --> 00:11:23,388
as long as it can be properly restored.

256
00:11:23,707 --> 00:11:24,628
I'll give it a try.

257
00:11:26,347 --> 00:11:27,628
Thank you, Ms. Tanshi.

258
00:11:37,589 --> 00:11:38,537
(Tan)

259
00:11:40,188 --> 00:11:41,947
(This is the forbidden area
of the library,)

260
00:11:42,148 --> 00:11:42,947
(so there must be)

261
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:44,067
(special skill books here.)

262
00:11:44,227 --> 00:11:45,188
(Knight Changfeng said)

263
00:11:45,188 --> 00:11:46,827
(practicing should be gradual,)

264
00:11:47,067 --> 00:11:47,908
(but he's been secretly giving)

265
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:49,227
(Xueying private tutoring.)

266
00:11:49,388 --> 00:11:51,067
(With my talent,)

267
00:11:51,107 --> 00:11:52,028
(I should directly practice)

268
00:11:52,028 --> 00:11:53,388
(higher-level martial arts.)

269
00:12:31,099 --> 00:12:33,111
(Secret of Ritual Instruments)

270
00:12:33,311 --> 00:12:34,543
(Methodology of Cardinal Directions)

271
00:12:42,268 --> 00:12:43,987
(Someone else is here?)

272
00:12:59,067 --> 00:12:59,747
Jingqiu.

273
00:13:00,428 --> 00:13:01,347
What are you doing here?

274
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:02,827
I'm here

275
00:13:02,867 --> 00:13:04,308
to look for some skill books.

276
00:13:04,428 --> 00:13:05,428
What book do you want to read?

277
00:13:05,788 --> 00:13:06,548
I can help you.

278
00:13:07,747 --> 00:13:08,388
No, thanks.

279
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:09,788
I've already finished reading.

280
00:13:19,202 --> 00:13:21,308
(Lone Tiger Devouring the Sun Manual)

281
00:13:26,227 --> 00:13:27,508
(Only in this way)

282
00:13:28,148 --> 00:13:29,908
(can I surpass Xueying.)

283
00:13:44,867 --> 00:13:46,347
Truly vigorous and powerful.

284
00:14:12,308 --> 00:14:13,067
Situ Hong,

285
00:14:13,867 --> 00:14:14,508
how are you doing?

286
00:14:14,947 --> 00:14:15,827
Don't touch me.

287
00:14:27,707 --> 00:14:29,548
You two had a fight?

288
00:14:30,148 --> 00:14:31,107
How could that be possible?

289
00:14:32,388 --> 00:14:33,548
If one day,

290
00:14:34,148 --> 00:14:35,788
I fought with Dongbo Xueying,

291
00:14:36,188 --> 00:14:37,107
who would you help?

292
00:14:45,467 --> 00:14:46,388
What's wrong with him?

293
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:48,028
I don't know. I just arrived.

294
00:14:51,067 --> 00:14:52,628
This is all Situ Hong's doing?

295
00:14:53,107 --> 00:14:54,668
He usually doesn't act like this.

296
00:14:56,227 --> 00:14:57,587
Actually, I wanted to ask

297
00:14:57,987 --> 00:14:58,707
that question too.

298
00:14:59,548 --> 00:15:00,467
What?

299
00:15:01,067 --> 00:15:02,388
If he and I fought,

300
00:15:02,867 --> 00:15:03,548
who would you help?

301
00:15:06,188 --> 00:15:07,388
Of course,

302
00:15:07,388 --> 00:15:09,587
it'd be the one in the right,
not the close one.

303
00:15:10,467 --> 00:15:12,788
Then am I in the right or the close one?

304
00:15:13,827 --> 00:15:15,947
You are my opponent.

305
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:17,347
Opponent?

306
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:20,508
I've decided to participate
in the Transcendent Trial.

307
00:15:20,508 --> 00:15:22,308
So aren't you my opponent?

308
00:15:35,467 --> 00:15:36,467
You tell me.

309
00:15:36,827 --> 00:15:38,148
Why can Dongbo Xueying

310
00:15:38,148 --> 00:15:40,028
easily

311
00:15:40,148 --> 00:15:41,428
become Transcendent,

312
00:15:41,867 --> 00:15:43,148
but I can't?

313
00:15:46,148 --> 00:15:47,548
Why don't you speak?

314
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,508
Even you don't want to talk to me.

315
00:15:55,668 --> 00:15:56,747
These are Shennong Pills.

316
00:15:56,747 --> 00:15:58,028
They're for treating internal injuries

317
00:15:58,028 --> 00:15:59,067
and are good for you.

318
00:16:04,107 --> 00:16:05,747
In the entire Changfeng Academy,

319
00:16:06,628 --> 00:16:08,107
only you care about me.

320
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,788
Everyone cares about you.

321
00:16:11,388 --> 00:16:12,188
But,

322
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,028
what exactly are you practicing?

323
00:16:14,148 --> 00:16:15,628
How did you hurt yourself?

324
00:16:18,148 --> 00:16:18,947
Jingqiu,

325
00:16:19,987 --> 00:16:21,508
after the Transcendent Trial

326
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:22,827
ends

327
00:16:23,668 --> 00:16:25,148
and I find Si Borong,

328
00:16:25,628 --> 00:16:26,867
I'll have my aunt

329
00:16:27,668 --> 00:16:28,947
go to the Water Daoist Temple

330
00:16:28,947 --> 00:16:30,067
to propose to you for me.

331
00:16:30,867 --> 00:16:31,707
No, no.

332
00:16:32,227 --> 00:16:33,227
I should go to your house,

333
00:16:33,227 --> 00:16:34,388
to see your parents,

334
00:16:34,388 --> 00:16:34,987
and propose...

335
00:16:37,508 --> 00:16:38,908
I'm not lying.

336
00:16:39,107 --> 00:16:40,268
Since the day I entered

337
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:41,268
Changfeng Academy,

338
00:16:42,467 --> 00:16:42,947
I've fallen

339
00:16:43,308 --> 00:16:44,508
in love with you.

340
00:16:45,388 --> 00:16:46,148
After

341
00:16:46,388 --> 00:16:47,747
I find Si Borong

342
00:16:47,827 --> 00:16:49,428
and both of us become Transcendent,

343
00:16:49,428 --> 00:16:50,628
we'll go back to guard Nanqin.

344
00:16:50,628 --> 00:16:52,067
By then, reviving the Si Family army

345
00:16:52,227 --> 00:16:53,508
will have been just around the corner.

346
00:16:54,388 --> 00:16:55,308
Situ Hong,

347
00:16:55,947 --> 00:16:57,028
reviving the Si Family army

348
00:16:57,028 --> 00:16:58,028
is your responsibility.

349
00:16:58,028 --> 00:16:59,428
It has nothing to do with me.

350
00:16:59,668 --> 00:17:00,548
Moreover,

351
00:17:01,188 --> 00:17:02,587
there's no way for us to be together.

352
00:17:05,068 --> 00:17:05,787
Why?

353
00:17:06,547 --> 00:17:07,908
Just because of Dongbo Xueying?

354
00:17:08,267 --> 00:17:09,547
Knowledge, family background,

355
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:10,707
in which aspect am I worse than him?

356
00:17:11,707 --> 00:17:12,588
Or did you...?

357
00:17:12,908 --> 00:17:14,307
When you were alone

358
00:17:14,307 --> 00:17:15,227
at the Black Wind Cliff,

359
00:17:15,267 --> 00:17:15,908
did you...?

360
00:17:17,188 --> 00:17:18,628
Don't let me look down on you.

361
00:17:30,203 --> 00:17:32,024
(Changfeng Academy)

362
00:18:02,188 --> 00:18:03,188
Situ Hong,

363
00:18:03,348 --> 00:18:04,868
what have you done wrong again?

364
00:18:06,628 --> 00:18:07,388
What do you mean?

365
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:09,428
From the moment you sat down,

366
00:18:09,428 --> 00:18:10,588
in just one minute,

367
00:18:11,108 --> 00:18:12,868
you've glanced at Jingqiu 11 times.

368
00:18:13,027 --> 00:18:14,307
Yet, she didn't even give you

369
00:18:14,307 --> 00:18:15,108
a glance.

370
00:18:15,307 --> 00:18:16,467
If you haven't done something wrong,

371
00:18:16,507 --> 00:18:17,307
then what else is possible?

372
00:18:17,947 --> 00:18:19,108
Eat your bun.

373
00:18:19,507 --> 00:18:20,588
Puyang Bo,

374
00:18:20,747 --> 00:18:21,987
what are you doing?

375
00:18:21,987 --> 00:18:22,507
No, no.

376
00:18:22,507 --> 00:18:23,307
I told you to eat the bun.

377
00:18:23,307 --> 00:18:23,908
You eat.

378
00:18:23,947 --> 00:18:25,267
Xueying, over here.

379
00:18:27,267 --> 00:18:28,188
Xueying,

380
00:18:28,267 --> 00:18:29,868
you've been practicing all day,
and you must be tired.

381
00:18:29,868 --> 00:18:30,987
Eat a bun.

382
00:18:31,188 --> 00:18:31,828
I'll go get you

383
00:18:31,828 --> 00:18:32,987
some hot congee.

384
00:18:33,388 --> 00:18:34,787
No, thanks.

385
00:18:34,908 --> 00:18:35,628
I'll go help her,

386
00:18:35,628 --> 00:18:36,828
or she'll burn herself again.

387
00:18:40,027 --> 00:18:40,908
Wash your hands.

388
00:18:40,908 --> 00:18:42,467
I've washed them. Smell.

389
00:18:51,227 --> 00:18:52,747
Drink some water. It's a bit hot.

390
00:18:59,507 --> 00:19:00,707
Xueying,

391
00:19:01,188 --> 00:19:02,428
here's a side dish and sweet cakes.

392
00:19:02,428 --> 00:19:03,868
Xueying, please give it a try.

393
00:19:06,707 --> 00:19:07,588
Such a bunch

394
00:19:07,588 --> 00:19:08,987
of sycophants.

395
00:19:11,588 --> 00:19:12,547
You.

396
00:19:12,547 --> 00:19:13,188
If you can't speak nicely,

397
00:19:13,188 --> 00:19:14,267
just keep your mouth shut.

398
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:15,747
Or it'd be really annoying, you know?

399
00:19:15,747 --> 00:19:16,348
Right?

400
00:19:16,507 --> 00:19:18,588
Exactly. Puyang Bo, well said.

401
00:19:21,068 --> 00:19:21,868
Xueying,

402
00:19:22,588 --> 00:19:23,148
are all your friends

403
00:19:23,148 --> 00:19:24,428
so rude?

404
00:19:25,467 --> 00:19:26,428
No wonder.

405
00:19:27,068 --> 00:19:28,267
Those who stay near ink get stained.

406
00:19:29,108 --> 00:19:29,628
Situ Hong,

407
00:19:29,628 --> 00:19:30,267
I find you

408
00:19:30,267 --> 00:19:31,148
quite interesting.

409
00:19:31,188 --> 00:19:32,388
I'm the one who said those words.

410
00:19:32,388 --> 00:19:32,828
Why do you

411
00:19:32,828 --> 00:19:34,027
have to target Xueying?

412
00:19:34,027 --> 00:19:34,467
Besides,

413
00:19:34,467 --> 00:19:35,388
what are you talking about?

414
00:19:35,388 --> 00:19:36,588
What ink?

415
00:19:36,588 --> 00:19:37,707
We just don't like you

416
00:19:37,707 --> 00:19:38,747
and don't want to eat with you.

417
00:19:38,747 --> 00:19:39,507
Can't you eat

418
00:19:39,507 --> 00:19:40,148
by yourself?

419
00:19:40,148 --> 00:19:41,507
All right, Puyang Bo.

420
00:19:41,507 --> 00:19:42,348
Eat your food.

421
00:19:43,707 --> 00:19:45,348
Parenting is really a great thing.

422
00:19:46,507 --> 00:19:47,668
What? What did you say?

423
00:19:50,507 --> 00:19:51,707
Did I say something wrong?

424
00:19:53,148 --> 00:19:54,628
You're such a brown-noser.

425
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:56,307
Do your parents know?

426
00:19:57,388 --> 00:19:58,908
What a pitiful creature

427
00:19:58,908 --> 00:20:00,307
born without manners.

428
00:20:04,068 --> 00:20:05,108
You can target me.

429
00:20:05,227 --> 00:20:06,828
But don't involve others.

430
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:15,908
Dongbo Xueying,

431
00:20:16,787 --> 00:20:18,068
I've been tolerating
you for a long time.

432
00:20:21,388 --> 00:20:22,947
What a coincidence, me too.

433
00:20:23,307 --> 00:20:24,908
Didn't you advance
to the Transcendent Level?

434
00:20:25,868 --> 00:20:26,987
Let's have a spar together.

435
00:20:31,787 --> 00:20:32,868
What are you doing?

436
00:20:36,507 --> 00:20:37,868
Who still remembers

437
00:20:37,987 --> 00:20:38,908
the rules of Changfeng Academy?

438
00:20:42,868 --> 00:20:43,707
Jingqiu.

439
00:20:45,707 --> 00:20:47,628
The one who instigates trouble
and strikes first

440
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:48,507
will be punished.

441
00:20:48,747 --> 00:20:49,467
Brother.

442
00:20:50,628 --> 00:20:51,388
Master,

443
00:20:51,707 --> 00:20:52,947
it was Xueying who started it.

444
00:20:54,027 --> 00:20:55,108
Xueying, is that so?

445
00:20:55,388 --> 00:20:56,467
No,

446
00:20:56,467 --> 00:20:57,348
it was clearly you who started it first.

447
00:20:57,348 --> 00:20:58,307
I started it.

448
00:20:58,908 --> 00:20:59,987
I'll accept punishment.

449
00:21:02,068 --> 00:21:03,388
Clean the library

450
00:21:03,388 --> 00:21:04,467
without using spells.

451
00:21:04,467 --> 00:21:05,428
Go now.

452
00:21:05,428 --> 00:21:06,227
Master.

453
00:21:06,227 --> 00:21:06,747
Yes.

454
00:21:08,388 --> 00:21:09,068
Xueying.

455
00:21:16,388 --> 00:21:17,188
Situ Hong.

456
00:21:17,868 --> 00:21:19,027
You won't eat for three days.

457
00:21:19,348 --> 00:21:20,188
Master.

458
00:21:20,188 --> 00:21:21,628
Isn't that too easy for him?

459
00:21:24,987 --> 00:21:26,068
Yes.

460
00:21:33,428 --> 00:21:34,307
Are you full?

461
00:21:35,188 --> 00:21:36,108
Go to practice now!

462
00:21:37,467 --> 00:21:38,348
Go.

463
00:21:38,467 --> 00:21:39,467
Go.

464
00:21:54,348 --> 00:21:56,188
They say you favor Xueying.

465
00:21:56,188 --> 00:21:56,987
Now it seems

466
00:21:56,987 --> 00:21:58,267
it may not be good for him.

467
00:21:58,388 --> 00:21:59,787
You are too strict with him.

468
00:22:00,188 --> 00:22:00,908
Don't worry.

469
00:22:01,428 --> 00:22:02,547
He can handle

470
00:22:02,987 --> 00:22:04,467
this little pressure.

471
00:22:06,588 --> 00:22:07,747
I'm more worried

472
00:22:07,868 --> 00:22:08,747
about Situ Hong.

473
00:22:09,108 --> 00:22:10,188
Young people

474
00:22:10,188 --> 00:22:11,188
are impatient.

475
00:22:11,307 --> 00:22:12,987
But being competitive
is a positive trait.

476
00:22:14,068 --> 00:22:15,388
Do you still remember Moyang Chen?

477
00:22:16,428 --> 00:22:17,787
You're worrying

478
00:22:17,987 --> 00:22:20,108
Situ Hong will end up like him?

479
00:22:22,828 --> 00:22:24,947
I hope my worries are unnecessary.

480
00:22:29,388 --> 00:22:30,108
Xueying.

481
00:22:31,428 --> 00:22:31,868
Xueying.

482
00:22:31,868 --> 00:22:32,908
Xueying.

483
00:22:33,267 --> 00:22:34,348
Why are you here?

484
00:22:35,868 --> 00:22:36,428
Xueying,

485
00:22:36,507 --> 00:22:37,987
you were punished

486
00:22:37,987 --> 00:22:38,868
because of me.

487
00:22:38,868 --> 00:22:40,027
Of course I'd come.

488
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:41,828
With more people,
it'll be done more quickly.

489
00:22:41,828 --> 00:22:42,868
So we all came.

490
00:22:44,068 --> 00:22:45,108
It's not actually dirty here,

491
00:22:45,108 --> 00:22:46,507
so it won't take long.

492
00:22:48,908 --> 00:22:49,507
Youyue.

493
00:22:49,507 --> 00:22:50,668
Didn't Master say

494
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:51,828
no spells were allowed?

495
00:22:52,428 --> 00:22:53,307
Master just said

496
00:22:53,307 --> 00:22:54,068
Xueying was not allowed

497
00:22:54,068 --> 00:22:54,947
to use spells.

498
00:22:54,947 --> 00:22:55,747
But he didn't say we can't

499
00:22:55,787 --> 00:22:56,668
use spells.

500
00:22:58,027 --> 00:22:58,828
Makes sense.

501
00:22:59,868 --> 00:23:00,787
Why are you still standing there?

502
00:23:00,787 --> 00:23:01,507
Hurry up and clean.

503
00:23:01,707 --> 00:23:03,348
You're good at spells. You do it first.

504
00:23:03,348 --> 00:23:05,628
Let me clean first.

505
00:23:14,987 --> 00:23:15,747
Jingqiu.

506
00:23:26,108 --> 00:23:26,707
Jingqiu.

507
00:23:27,547 --> 00:23:28,227
Jingqiu.

508
00:23:30,868 --> 00:23:31,547
Jingqiu.

509
00:23:58,227 --> 00:23:59,267
Father.

510
00:23:59,507 --> 00:24:00,668
Mother.

511
00:24:00,707 --> 00:24:03,108
Where are you?

512
00:24:03,747 --> 00:24:04,947
Father.

513
00:24:17,668 --> 00:24:19,108
Snowflake Demon.

514
00:24:20,787 --> 00:24:21,428
Jingqiu.

515
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:22,588
What's wrong?

516
00:24:22,908 --> 00:24:23,787
Did you have a nightmare?

517
00:24:24,947 --> 00:24:26,027
You just got hit lightly.

518
00:24:26,547 --> 00:24:27,947
Why were you unconscious for so long?

519
00:24:29,068 --> 00:24:30,027
That was an oversight.

520
00:24:30,188 --> 00:24:31,868
I will practice harder in the future.

521
00:24:33,148 --> 00:24:34,388
It's fine now that you're awake.

522
00:24:34,547 --> 00:24:35,507
Rest well.

523
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:36,868
Master.

524
00:24:37,588 --> 00:24:38,947
Have you ever heard

525
00:24:39,428 --> 00:24:40,668
of Snowflake Demon that appeared

526
00:24:40,668 --> 00:24:42,227
near the Demon Well back then?

527
00:24:43,547 --> 00:24:44,388
That may be

528
00:24:44,787 --> 00:24:46,388
a demon that appears in snowflakes

529
00:24:47,108 --> 00:24:47,707
or

530
00:24:48,388 --> 00:24:49,507
a demon

531
00:24:49,507 --> 00:24:50,628
that attacks with snowflakes.

532
00:24:50,987 --> 00:24:51,987
Snowflake Demon?

533
00:24:53,868 --> 00:24:55,307
I never heard of it.

534
00:24:55,828 --> 00:24:56,507
What's up?

535
00:24:58,388 --> 00:24:59,628
I think

536
00:25:00,668 --> 00:25:02,507
it might have something
to do with my background.

537
00:25:09,947 --> 00:25:10,828
Take this token

538
00:25:11,108 --> 00:25:12,148
and go to ask Si Lianghong.

539
00:25:12,428 --> 00:25:13,428
She might know.

540
00:25:15,188 --> 00:25:15,947
Thank you, Master.

541
00:25:17,828 --> 00:25:18,987
This is a censer.

542
00:25:19,068 --> 00:25:20,267
It has the effect
of reviving the spirit.

543
00:25:20,467 --> 00:25:21,908
When you're uncomfortable,
just take a sniff.

544
00:25:24,027 --> 00:25:24,707
Jingqiu.

545
00:25:25,628 --> 00:25:26,188
Jingqiu.

546
00:25:27,307 --> 00:25:29,428
Jingqiu, you're finally awake.

547
00:25:29,588 --> 00:25:30,507
I'm sorry.

548
00:25:30,507 --> 00:25:31,707
You scared me to death.

549
00:25:32,188 --> 00:25:33,588
Wasn't it all because of you?

550
00:25:33,628 --> 00:25:34,668
I don't need your lesson.

551
00:25:34,668 --> 00:25:35,068
I'm fine.

552
00:25:35,068 --> 00:25:35,707
You...

553
00:25:36,868 --> 00:25:37,668
Did you hear that?

554
00:25:37,707 --> 00:25:38,947
Jingqiu said she was fine.

555
00:25:39,868 --> 00:25:41,148
Jingqiu said she was fine

556
00:25:41,148 --> 00:25:42,828
because she was being polite.

557
00:25:42,947 --> 00:25:44,267
Do you really think she's fine?

558
00:25:44,467 --> 00:25:44,868
You...

559
00:25:45,547 --> 00:25:46,588
Be quiet.

560
00:25:46,868 --> 00:25:47,947
How can she rest?

561
00:25:48,108 --> 00:25:48,947
Get out, all of you.

562
00:25:53,348 --> 00:25:54,348
Take a good rest.

563
00:26:22,628 --> 00:26:23,267
Jingqiu.

564
00:26:24,707 --> 00:26:26,027
I brought you osmanthus cake.

565
00:26:26,828 --> 00:26:27,547
You...

566
00:26:28,307 --> 00:26:29,068
You are going out?

567
00:26:30,267 --> 00:26:31,108
I'm fine now.

568
00:26:31,108 --> 00:26:32,307
I want to take a walk.

569
00:26:32,588 --> 00:26:33,348
I'll accompany you.

570
00:26:33,428 --> 00:26:34,108
No.

571
00:26:34,987 --> 00:26:35,628
Why not?

572
00:26:36,947 --> 00:26:37,547
I...

573
00:26:37,908 --> 00:26:38,787
I'm going to buy

574
00:26:38,787 --> 00:26:39,787
some things for women.

575
00:26:39,787 --> 00:26:41,068
It's inconvenient
to have you accompany me.

576
00:26:42,628 --> 00:26:44,068
Then I'll go to ask Dean Changfeng

577
00:26:44,068 --> 00:26:44,628
if he thinks

578
00:26:44,628 --> 00:26:45,227
it's inconvenient too.

579
00:26:45,227 --> 00:26:45,828
Don't.

580
00:26:46,628 --> 00:26:47,507
Xueying.

581
00:26:48,068 --> 00:26:49,868
Actually, last night when I fainted,

582
00:26:49,868 --> 00:26:50,787
I had a dream.

583
00:26:51,628 --> 00:26:52,868
You dreamed of your parents again?

584
00:26:54,707 --> 00:26:55,628
And,

585
00:26:55,947 --> 00:26:57,148
Snowflake Demon.

586
00:26:57,707 --> 00:26:59,108
Snowflake Demon?

587
00:26:59,628 --> 00:27:01,188
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

588
00:27:01,507 --> 00:27:02,428
It's a demon

589
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:03,428
with snowflake marks

590
00:27:03,428 --> 00:27:04,467
on its hand.

591
00:27:05,227 --> 00:27:06,108
So,

592
00:27:06,467 --> 00:27:06,987
your parents

593
00:27:06,987 --> 00:27:08,467
were abducted by the Snowflake Demon?

594
00:27:08,707 --> 00:27:09,588
I don't know.

595
00:27:09,987 --> 00:27:10,628
But I remember

596
00:27:10,628 --> 00:27:12,068
the place in my dream

597
00:27:12,388 --> 00:27:13,267
was the Demon Well.

598
00:27:13,547 --> 00:27:15,188
The Demon Well in Nanqin City?

599
00:27:16,428 --> 00:27:17,828
So I want to take a look.

600
00:27:17,828 --> 00:27:19,628
Maybe I can find some clues.

601
00:27:19,747 --> 00:27:20,388
Xueying,

602
00:27:20,668 --> 00:27:22,267
you must keep this secret for me.

603
00:27:22,388 --> 00:27:23,267
I'll accompany you.

604
00:27:23,828 --> 00:27:24,547
How can that be?

605
00:27:24,588 --> 00:27:25,388
Why not?

606
00:27:26,908 --> 00:27:28,547
We agreed at the Black Wind Cliff

607
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:29,628
that I would accompany you

608
00:27:29,628 --> 00:27:30,428
in finding your true identity.

609
00:27:30,547 --> 00:27:31,188
And,

610
00:27:31,507 --> 00:27:32,588
if we encounter danger,

611
00:27:32,668 --> 00:27:33,787
I can protect you.

612
00:27:35,908 --> 00:27:36,707
We should hurry.

613
00:27:36,908 --> 00:27:37,507
Let's go.

614
00:27:38,227 --> 00:27:38,707
Alright.

615
00:27:40,348 --> 00:27:41,547
The dean has ordered,

616
00:27:41,707 --> 00:27:43,388
to prevent demons
from entering the academy,

617
00:27:43,467 --> 00:27:44,467
no outsiders

618
00:27:44,467 --> 00:27:46,148
are allowed to enter.

619
00:27:46,868 --> 00:27:47,707
Please go back.

620
00:27:48,588 --> 00:27:49,348
Yue,

621
00:27:49,707 --> 00:27:50,787
I'm your father.

622
00:27:51,108 --> 00:27:53,027
How did I become an outsider?

623
00:27:53,588 --> 00:27:55,188
I know the grievance

624
00:27:55,428 --> 00:27:56,307
you suffered before.

625
00:27:56,828 --> 00:27:58,027
It's all in the past.

626
00:28:05,188 --> 00:28:05,987
Father,

627
00:28:06,108 --> 00:28:06,747
I thought

628
00:28:06,747 --> 00:28:08,547
you no longer wanted me
as your daughter.

629
00:28:09,628 --> 00:28:10,747
How could that be?

630
00:28:11,068 --> 00:28:12,987
You are my biological daughter.

631
00:28:14,428 --> 00:28:14,987
Okay.

632
00:28:15,707 --> 00:28:16,747
Let's go in first.

633
00:28:17,108 --> 00:28:18,628
Let me take a good look at you

634
00:28:18,747 --> 00:28:19,707
and take a look

635
00:28:20,068 --> 00:28:21,348
at my future son-in-law.

636
00:28:22,787 --> 00:28:23,947
What son-in-law?

637
00:28:24,908 --> 00:28:25,828
Silly girl,

638
00:28:26,547 --> 00:28:27,267
you and Xueying

639
00:28:27,267 --> 00:28:28,747
were engaged as children.

640
00:28:28,987 --> 00:28:29,588
So

641
00:28:29,707 --> 00:28:30,588
he is naturally

642
00:28:30,588 --> 00:28:31,747
my future son-in-law.

643
00:28:31,747 --> 00:28:32,428
Father,

644
00:28:32,467 --> 00:28:33,987
what nonsense are you talking about?

645
00:28:35,707 --> 00:28:36,348
Xueying.

646
00:28:36,507 --> 00:28:36,947
Father.

647
00:28:37,707 --> 00:28:40,108
Did you come to meet me on purpose

648
00:28:40,108 --> 00:28:41,668
after hearing that I was here?

649
00:28:42,467 --> 00:28:44,227
Mr. Kong, I was just about to go out.

650
00:28:46,188 --> 00:28:47,148
That proves

651
00:28:47,188 --> 00:28:48,467
we're fated.

652
00:28:48,908 --> 00:28:50,148
Since you're going out,

653
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:50,947
then,

654
00:28:51,188 --> 00:28:52,828
I'll make it short.

655
00:28:53,267 --> 00:28:54,027
Father.

656
00:28:55,348 --> 00:28:56,628
My girl

657
00:28:56,747 --> 00:28:57,747
is a bit shy.

658
00:28:58,108 --> 00:28:59,507
So, as her father,

659
00:28:59,507 --> 00:29:01,148
I have to stand up for her.

660
00:29:01,547 --> 00:29:03,148
Should your marriage

661
00:29:03,388 --> 00:29:04,348
with Youyue

662
00:29:04,348 --> 00:29:06,747
be in preparation soon?

663
00:29:08,507 --> 00:29:09,148
Mr. Kong,

664
00:29:09,987 --> 00:29:10,828
I cannot agree

665
00:29:10,828 --> 00:29:11,787
to this marriage.

666
00:29:13,908 --> 00:29:14,547
Because

667
00:29:15,628 --> 00:29:16,787
I already have someone I like.

668
00:29:17,027 --> 00:29:17,507
You...

669
00:29:18,348 --> 00:29:19,428
You two…

670
00:29:19,668 --> 00:29:20,467
My mother once said

671
00:29:20,787 --> 00:29:22,307
that one should follow their heart

672
00:29:22,307 --> 00:29:23,108
and should not deceive.

673
00:29:23,108 --> 00:29:23,787
So

674
00:29:23,908 --> 00:29:25,027
I don't want to deceive you.

675
00:29:25,348 --> 00:29:26,267
Please understand, Mr. Kong.

676
00:29:27,068 --> 00:29:28,908
You're good, Dongbo Xueying.

677
00:29:28,947 --> 00:29:30,307
Aren't you afraid I'll accuse you

678
00:29:30,307 --> 00:29:32,668
of being unfaithful and bullying?

679
00:29:33,027 --> 00:29:34,388
From beginning to end,

680
00:29:34,388 --> 00:29:35,428
it's all just your words

681
00:29:35,588 --> 00:29:36,507
without any proof.

682
00:29:36,987 --> 00:29:38,188
I'm afraid it's hard
to convince everyone.

683
00:29:38,868 --> 00:29:40,148
If you insist on blaming me,

684
00:29:40,348 --> 00:29:40,908
why not wait

685
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:42,267
until I save my mother?

686
00:29:42,747 --> 00:29:44,027
By then, I'll make it right with you.

687
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:45,668
I have other matters.

688
00:29:45,868 --> 00:29:46,388
Excuse me.

689
00:29:47,148 --> 00:29:47,668
You...

690
00:29:50,307 --> 00:29:51,507
Are you satisfied now?

691
00:29:56,108 --> 00:29:57,787
Master, these gifts...

692
00:29:58,908 --> 00:29:59,987
He is

693
00:30:00,188 --> 00:30:02,588
just blinded by a woman.

694
00:30:02,868 --> 00:30:04,307
It's no big deal.

695
00:30:04,868 --> 00:30:05,747
I just need

696
00:30:05,747 --> 00:30:07,467
to get rid

697
00:30:07,987 --> 00:30:08,908
of her.

698
00:30:09,547 --> 00:30:10,068
Let's go.

699
00:30:15,467 --> 00:30:16,467
(What's the deal)

700
00:30:16,467 --> 00:30:17,828
(with that Snowflake Demon?)

701
00:30:18,388 --> 00:30:19,348
(Why did it appear)

702
00:30:19,348 --> 00:30:20,307
(in my dream?)

703
00:30:20,868 --> 00:30:22,507
(And what's the deal
with the snowflake mark)

704
00:30:22,507 --> 00:30:23,868
(on my back?)

705
00:30:24,588 --> 00:30:25,467
(If)

706
00:30:26,027 --> 00:30:27,267
(I'm really)

707
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,547
(under the Snowflake Demon's curse,)

708
00:30:29,068 --> 00:30:30,068
(will Xueying)

709
00:30:30,507 --> 00:30:32,388
(still stay by my side?)

710
00:30:33,467 --> 00:30:34,787
You haven't answered my question.

711
00:30:35,428 --> 00:30:36,467
What question?

712
00:30:40,267 --> 00:30:41,547
I said I have someone I like.

713
00:30:42,027 --> 00:30:43,108
Do you know who I'm talking about?

714
00:30:44,787 --> 00:30:45,547
Xueying,

715
00:30:46,068 --> 00:30:47,108
I know, of course.

716
00:30:47,668 --> 00:30:49,068
I know it in my heart.

717
00:30:49,828 --> 00:30:50,707
But...

718
00:30:52,348 --> 00:30:52,987
I still want

719
00:30:52,987 --> 00:30:54,507
to find my memory first.

720
00:30:57,307 --> 00:30:57,987
Understood.

721
00:31:03,148 --> 00:31:03,707
Let's go.

722
00:31:04,068 --> 00:31:04,987
To help you find your memory.

723
00:31:08,507 --> 00:31:11,507
(Nanqin City)

724
00:31:11,507 --> 00:31:12,267
Xueying,

725
00:31:12,707 --> 00:31:13,828
are you angry?

726
00:31:15,027 --> 00:31:16,227
Do you care if I'm angry?

727
00:31:16,467 --> 00:31:17,507
Of course, I care.

728
00:31:17,747 --> 00:31:18,547
But...

729
00:31:19,188 --> 00:31:19,747
Come out.

730
00:31:50,171 --> 00:31:52,226
(Dragon Mountain Empire Map)

731
00:31:55,507 --> 00:31:56,188
General,

732
00:31:56,188 --> 00:31:57,628
some people trespassed
near the Demon Well.

733
00:31:57,668 --> 00:31:58,388
Who are they?

734
00:31:58,467 --> 00:31:59,588
Did you see them clearly?

735
00:31:59,628 --> 00:32:00,947
The scout didn't dare to get too close.

736
00:32:00,947 --> 00:32:02,148
Although there are only four of them,

737
00:32:02,148 --> 00:32:03,348
their strength is extraordinary.

738
00:32:03,628 --> 00:32:05,148
I think they have bad intentions.

739
00:32:20,428 --> 00:32:21,747
They seem to be targeting you.

740
00:32:27,428 --> 00:32:28,148
Who dares

741
00:32:28,148 --> 00:32:29,307
to break into Nanqin City?

742
00:32:30,507 --> 00:32:31,868
We are students from Changfeng Academy,

743
00:32:31,868 --> 00:32:32,868
not bad people.

744
00:32:35,388 --> 00:32:36,668
I'm Yu Jingqiu.

745
00:32:36,668 --> 00:32:37,987
Greetings, General Si.

746
00:32:38,428 --> 00:32:39,628
I'm Dongbo Xueying.

747
00:32:39,628 --> 00:32:40,628
Greetings, General Si.

748
00:32:41,588 --> 00:32:43,747
What are you here for?

749
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:51,388
This is the incense burner

750
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:52,628
my master gave me before.

751
00:32:52,787 --> 00:32:54,188
There is his mark on it.

752
00:32:54,507 --> 00:32:55,987
He said as long as I gave this to you,

753
00:32:55,987 --> 00:32:57,588
you would help me with my questions.

754
00:32:59,987 --> 00:33:00,947
Interesting.

755
00:33:01,227 --> 00:33:02,307
Is there anything

756
00:33:02,307 --> 00:33:03,908
that I can do
but Knight Changfeng can't?

757
00:33:04,148 --> 00:33:05,068
May I ask,

758
00:33:05,348 --> 00:33:07,267
have you ever heard of Snowflake Demon?

759
00:33:08,148 --> 00:33:08,947
Never.

760
00:33:09,588 --> 00:33:10,908
Please think carefully again.

761
00:33:11,267 --> 00:33:12,787
Or is there any demon with

762
00:33:12,868 --> 00:33:14,188
a snowflake mark on its body?

763
00:33:14,668 --> 00:33:16,947
I was on the front line
during the great battle,

764
00:33:16,947 --> 00:33:18,707
and I killed countless demons.

765
00:33:18,828 --> 00:33:20,307
But I didn't see

766
00:33:20,307 --> 00:33:21,908
a demon with snowflake marks.

767
00:33:22,628 --> 00:33:23,868
Is there a problem?

768
00:33:25,628 --> 00:33:26,348
Madam,

769
00:33:26,588 --> 00:33:27,908
we heard

770
00:33:27,987 --> 00:33:29,227
the guards at Lu's Fort mention it,

771
00:33:29,547 --> 00:33:30,828
but we've never found any clues.

772
00:33:31,227 --> 00:33:33,027
Jingqiu was just too anxious.

773
00:33:33,148 --> 00:33:34,227
Please forgive us, madam.

774
00:33:35,108 --> 00:33:36,987
Don't worry. I understand.

775
00:33:37,707 --> 00:33:38,628
Speaking of which,

776
00:33:39,108 --> 00:33:41,148
aren't you Dongbo Xueying?

777
00:33:41,707 --> 00:33:43,467
I heard you've made great progress.

778
00:33:43,787 --> 00:33:44,467
Why did you seem

779
00:33:44,467 --> 00:33:46,267
to be unable to defend yourself

780
00:33:46,267 --> 00:33:47,787
against those two assassins today?

781
00:33:47,908 --> 00:33:49,267
Because at the Black Wind Cliff...

782
00:33:49,267 --> 00:33:50,148
I'm incompetent.

783
00:33:50,267 --> 00:33:51,307
Please pardon my performance.

784
00:33:51,987 --> 00:33:53,027
It doesn't matter.

785
00:33:53,027 --> 00:33:54,707
This is not Changfeng Academy.

786
00:33:54,707 --> 00:33:55,987
There are no such strict rules.

787
00:33:56,947 --> 00:33:57,908
There must be nothing delicious

788
00:33:57,908 --> 00:33:59,707
in Chi Qiubai's place.

789
00:33:59,908 --> 00:34:00,668
Today,

790
00:34:00,668 --> 00:34:01,588
I'll let you try

791
00:34:01,588 --> 00:34:03,148
our army's specialty,

792
00:34:03,148 --> 00:34:03,908
roasted meat.

793
00:34:04,227 --> 00:34:05,148
But you must never

794
00:34:05,148 --> 00:34:07,068
mention this to Borong.

795
00:34:07,068 --> 00:34:08,068
If he knows,

796
00:34:08,068 --> 00:34:09,508
he will be super jealous.

797
00:34:09,827 --> 00:34:10,508
Madam,

798
00:34:11,227 --> 00:34:12,747
Si Borong has been missing
for a long time.

799
00:34:12,907 --> 00:34:13,668
Didn't you know?

800
00:34:13,988 --> 00:34:14,668
What?

801
00:34:14,867 --> 00:34:16,227
Borong is missing?

802
00:34:28,867 --> 00:34:29,827
Situ Hong,

803
00:34:32,867 --> 00:34:34,227
this book has been repaired.

804
00:34:34,307 --> 00:34:34,948
Here you are.

805
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:36,747
Thank you, Master.

806
00:34:42,028 --> 00:34:43,028
Don't you have anything else

807
00:34:43,028 --> 00:34:44,068
to say to me?

808
00:34:56,747 --> 00:34:57,628
Master,

809
00:34:57,988 --> 00:34:58,628
I was wrong.

810
00:34:58,628 --> 00:34:59,427
I can explain.

811
00:34:59,427 --> 00:35:00,347
Situ Hong,

812
00:35:00,588 --> 00:35:02,148
this is my negligence.

813
00:35:02,148 --> 00:35:04,028
I will take
the punishment from the dean.

814
00:35:04,387 --> 00:35:05,227
As for you,

815
00:35:06,108 --> 00:35:07,227
considering that you are
a member of the Si Family,

816
00:35:07,227 --> 00:35:07,827
I'll give you

817
00:35:07,827 --> 00:35:09,347
one last piece of advice.

818
00:35:09,668 --> 00:35:10,548
A barren land

819
00:35:10,668 --> 00:35:12,068
cannot grow towering trees.

820
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,227
Do not be impatient for success.

821
00:35:16,827 --> 00:35:17,707
That is how you see me

822
00:35:18,028 --> 00:35:18,747
in your mind?

823
00:35:18,747 --> 00:35:20,548
A barren land?

824
00:35:20,907 --> 00:35:21,827
I will definitely become

825
00:35:21,827 --> 00:35:23,108
a towering tree.

826
00:35:32,988 --> 00:35:34,108
If it weren't for Dongbo Xueying

827
00:35:34,148 --> 00:35:35,427
telling me about Borong's disappearance,

828
00:35:35,427 --> 00:35:37,108
how long were you planning
to hide it from me?

829
00:35:38,188 --> 00:35:39,508
I've been looking for Borong,

830
00:35:39,628 --> 00:35:40,347
but this place

831
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,628
has been set with a barrier by the dean,

832
00:35:41,668 --> 00:35:43,108
and I had no chance to inform you.

833
00:35:43,188 --> 00:35:44,468
Even at this point,

834
00:35:44,468 --> 00:35:45,668
you're still making excuses.

835
00:35:45,668 --> 00:35:47,267
You disappoint me too much.

836
00:35:51,588 --> 00:35:52,668
If you can't find Borong,

837
00:35:52,668 --> 00:35:54,148
don't come back to the Si Family.

838
00:36:03,747 --> 00:36:05,468
Dongbo Xueying.

839
00:36:08,707 --> 00:36:09,867
We're here to say goodbye.

840
00:36:09,867 --> 00:36:11,028
Please pass on the message.

841
00:36:11,508 --> 00:36:12,188
The general went

842
00:36:12,267 --> 00:36:13,588
to Changfeng Academy last night.

843
00:36:13,907 --> 00:36:15,148
Before she left, she instructed us

844
00:36:15,387 --> 00:36:16,307
to safely escort you

845
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:17,347
out of Nanqin City.

846
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:19,108
Thank you.

847
00:36:22,548 --> 00:36:23,787
You got a cold?

848
00:36:23,907 --> 00:36:24,707
I'm fine.

849
00:36:25,108 --> 00:36:25,827
What about you?

850
00:36:25,827 --> 00:36:26,907
We don't have any clues now.

851
00:36:27,028 --> 00:36:27,867
What should we do next?

852
00:36:28,347 --> 00:36:29,387
I don't know.

853
00:36:29,628 --> 00:36:30,948
Let's continue and see.

854
00:36:32,227 --> 00:36:32,747
Be careful.

855
00:36:41,747 --> 00:36:42,948
Youyue's hairpin.

856
00:36:43,836 --> 00:36:46,195
(Someone will be killed. Wang Cheng Dyehouse)

857
00:36:50,222 --> 00:36:52,918
(Wang Cheng Dyehouse)

858
00:37:25,148 --> 00:37:26,907
Xueying, help!

859
00:37:27,307 --> 00:37:27,827
Youyue.

860
00:37:27,827 --> 00:37:28,387
Man,

861
00:37:28,548 --> 00:37:29,387
don't be impulsive.

862
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:30,387
My machete

863
00:37:30,387 --> 00:37:32,028
can kill without shedding blood.

864
00:37:32,468 --> 00:37:33,307
What do you want?

865
00:37:33,668 --> 00:37:35,068
Hand over Yu Jingqiu

866
00:37:35,747 --> 00:37:36,988
for this girl.

867
00:37:37,867 --> 00:37:38,747
Don't even think about it.

868
00:37:39,508 --> 00:37:41,068
Such a heartless man.

869
00:37:41,588 --> 00:37:42,508
Little girl,

870
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:43,907
don't blame me for this.

871
00:37:44,267 --> 00:37:45,347
Then I'll

872
00:37:45,508 --> 00:37:46,267
kill her first.

873
00:37:46,267 --> 00:37:47,108
I'll exchange myself for her.

874
00:37:48,747 --> 00:37:49,907
Since you want me,

875
00:37:49,907 --> 00:37:51,028
why harm the innocent?

876
00:37:51,108 --> 00:37:51,787
Let her go,

877
00:37:51,787 --> 00:37:52,907
and I'll let you do as you please.

878
00:37:53,267 --> 00:37:53,747
Good.

879
00:37:54,068 --> 00:37:54,988
You come over first.

880
00:37:55,108 --> 00:37:56,108
Don't play any tricks.

881
00:38:10,307 --> 00:38:11,068
Let her go.

882
00:38:11,267 --> 00:38:13,347
Killers of Bloodshed Tavern only kill

883
00:38:13,387 --> 00:38:14,148
but never release people.

884
00:38:22,508 --> 00:38:23,188
Youyue.

885
00:38:33,508 --> 00:38:34,267
Are you alright?

886
00:38:34,267 --> 00:38:34,988
I'm fine.

887
00:38:35,948 --> 00:38:37,307
It really is the Bloodshed Tavern.

888
00:38:43,347 --> 00:38:44,068
Jingqiu,

889
00:38:44,347 --> 00:38:45,948
did you offend someone?

890
00:38:46,548 --> 00:38:47,747
No matter who it is,

891
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:49,668
how dare they kidnap me

892
00:38:49,668 --> 00:38:50,707
and hurt Jingqiu!

893
00:38:50,787 --> 00:38:52,347
I'll tear them to pieces.

894
00:38:53,628 --> 00:38:54,267
Miss,

895
00:38:54,588 --> 00:38:55,707
she wasn't killed by me.

896
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:56,827
She just fainted.

897
00:38:57,548 --> 00:38:58,387
This assassin

898
00:38:58,387 --> 00:38:59,628
certainly won't easily reveal

899
00:38:59,707 --> 00:39:00,787
the one behind them.

900
00:39:01,387 --> 00:39:02,628
But I have a way

901
00:39:02,988 --> 00:39:03,988
to make her

902
00:39:04,227 --> 00:39:05,068
lead us to them.

903
00:39:18,948 --> 00:39:20,267
Child's play.

904
00:39:28,867 --> 00:39:30,028
50 thousand gold coins.

905
00:39:30,028 --> 00:39:31,427
That's so much money!

906
00:39:31,588 --> 00:39:32,948
Keep your voice down.

907
00:39:33,028 --> 00:39:33,747
Jingqiu

908
00:39:33,747 --> 00:39:35,068
managed to find out
after much difficulty.

909
00:39:35,468 --> 00:39:37,668
The other party spent 50 thousand

910
00:39:37,747 --> 00:39:39,707
to hire an assassin
from the Bloodshed Tavern.

911
00:39:41,347 --> 00:39:42,867
Such a pity.

912
00:39:42,867 --> 00:39:43,747
Why can't I come across

913
00:39:43,747 --> 00:39:44,948
such a big deal?

914
00:39:45,267 --> 00:39:47,148
Anyway, Jingqiu is out of their hands,

915
00:39:47,427 --> 00:39:49,307
and Gu Yan is trapped
in the barrier and can't get out.

916
00:39:49,307 --> 00:39:50,548
We can go to claim

917
00:39:50,548 --> 00:39:51,668
the bounty.

918
00:39:55,108 --> 00:39:56,227
(50 thousand?)

919
00:39:56,668 --> 00:39:57,787
(Didn't he say it was 20 thousand?)

920
00:39:58,028 --> 00:39:59,028
(Darn Mo Feng!)

921
00:39:59,028 --> 00:39:59,988
(He lied to me!)

922
00:40:00,427 --> 00:40:01,508
(Well, don't be shocked)

923
00:40:01,628 --> 00:40:02,867
(when I take action against you!)

924
00:40:05,628 --> 00:40:06,508
Done.

925
00:40:08,229 --> 00:40:11,094
(Jinghai Restaurant)

926
00:40:11,137 --> 00:40:13,961
(Wang's Weapon Shop)

927
00:40:29,307 --> 00:40:30,468
Are you sure it's here?

928
00:40:30,468 --> 00:40:30,988
Yes.

929
00:40:30,988 --> 00:40:32,347
They went into
the innermost private room.

930
00:40:32,347 --> 00:40:33,347
The problem now

931
00:40:33,347 --> 00:40:34,827
is that the rooms here
are too expensive.

932
00:40:34,827 --> 00:40:36,468
Do we really need to go in?

933
00:40:37,508 --> 00:40:38,668
Just go in.

934
00:40:39,387 --> 00:40:41,148
This place is owned by my family.

935
00:40:49,307 --> 00:40:50,347
Miss, you're here.

936
00:40:50,747 --> 00:40:51,907
What would you like to eat today?

937
00:40:51,907 --> 00:40:53,227
We have top-quality
edible bird's nests today.

938
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:54,468
Would you like some

939
00:40:54,548 --> 00:40:55,588
to replenish your energy?

940
00:40:56,028 --> 00:40:57,427
Here's the private room for you.

941
00:40:58,988 --> 00:41:00,347
I want the one upstairs.

942
00:41:01,188 --> 00:41:03,028
Unfortunately, it's occupied.

943
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,668
Could you please make do with this one?

944
00:41:06,707 --> 00:41:07,787
Come, sir.

945
00:41:07,787 --> 00:41:08,747
Come here,

946
00:41:08,747 --> 00:41:09,307
and let me talk to you.

947
00:41:09,307 --> 00:41:10,347
I-I-It's not appropriate.

948
00:41:10,347 --> 00:41:11,227
Come here.

949
00:41:11,227 --> 00:41:11,787
It's appropriate.

950
00:41:11,787 --> 00:41:12,588
It's not.

951
00:41:13,787 --> 00:41:15,588
Let me see who it is.

952
00:41:23,028 --> 00:41:23,707
Father?

953
00:41:25,628 --> 00:41:27,068
Why is it you?

954
00:41:31,028 --> 00:41:31,907
Kong Hai?

955
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:33,028
Mr. Kong.

956
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:35,227
What...?

957
00:41:35,508 --> 00:41:37,108
What is this for?

958
00:41:37,108 --> 00:41:38,148
Why did you do that?

959
00:41:39,588 --> 00:41:40,747
What are you talking about?

960
00:41:40,787 --> 00:41:42,068
I don't quite understand.

961
00:41:42,227 --> 00:41:42,988
You don't understand?

962
00:41:45,468 --> 00:41:47,068
Calm down. Calm down.

963
00:41:47,188 --> 00:41:48,347
I was just joking

964
00:41:48,548 --> 00:41:50,628
with Miss Yu.

965
00:41:50,867 --> 00:41:51,468
Joking?

966
00:41:51,867 --> 00:41:53,267
Then I'll joke with you too.

967
00:41:53,907 --> 00:41:54,867
I'll tell you.

968
00:41:55,307 --> 00:41:56,028
It was him.

969
00:41:57,307 --> 00:41:58,028
It was him.

970
00:41:58,068 --> 00:42:00,148
He advised me to go
to the Bloodshed Tavern

971
00:42:00,148 --> 00:42:01,188
and put out a bounty.

972
00:42:01,267 --> 00:42:01,907
He said

973
00:42:02,108 --> 00:42:03,548
as long as Yu Jingqiu was alive,

974
00:42:03,628 --> 00:42:05,427
you wouldn't marry Youyue.

975
00:42:05,548 --> 00:42:07,628
I was just stupid.

976
00:42:07,747 --> 00:42:09,628
I shouldn't have listened
to the bad advice.

977
00:42:09,827 --> 00:42:11,707
Master, please spare me.

978
00:42:16,787 --> 00:42:17,347
Let's go.

979
00:42:17,347 --> 00:42:18,108
Jingqiu.

980
00:42:21,747 --> 00:42:22,508
Jingqiu,

981
00:42:23,068 --> 00:42:24,068
I'll pay for my father's sin.

982
00:42:24,468 --> 00:42:25,747
I apologize to you

983
00:42:26,227 --> 00:42:27,548
for the mistake my father made.

984
00:42:30,707 --> 00:42:32,148
Yue, you...

985
00:42:32,227 --> 00:42:32,948
Yue.

986
00:42:36,068 --> 00:42:37,427
I truly feel

987
00:42:37,747 --> 00:42:38,668
guilty.

988
00:42:41,068 --> 00:42:41,628
Yue.

989
00:42:41,628 --> 00:42:42,227
Youyue.

990
00:42:48,427 --> 00:42:49,108
Today,

991
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:50,028
for Youyue's sake,

992
00:42:50,028 --> 00:42:51,068
I'll let you off the hook.

993
00:42:51,548 --> 00:42:52,948
But if there's a next time,

994
00:42:53,387 --> 00:42:54,028
I won't mind

995
00:42:54,028 --> 00:42:55,347
becoming the one who kills her father.

996
00:42:57,548 --> 00:42:58,468
Xueying, let's go.

997
00:42:59,347 --> 00:42:59,907
Remember,

998
00:43:00,347 --> 00:43:00,988
you should be grateful

999
00:43:00,988 --> 00:43:01,907
