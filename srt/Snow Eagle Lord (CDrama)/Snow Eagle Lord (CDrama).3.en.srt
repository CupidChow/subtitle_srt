Brother, you guys hurry up!

24
00:01:54,257 --> 00:01:54,817
Uncle Zong has prepared

25
00:01:54,938 --> 00:01:56,177
lots of delicious food.

26
00:01:56,177 --> 00:01:56,578
Come!

00:01:56,698 --> 00:01:57,537
Hurry, hurry!

Come!

29
00:02:02,138 --> 00:02:03,737
When away from home,

30
00:02:03,858 --> 00:02:05,097
you may not have enough
to eat sometimes.

31
00:02:05,138 --> 00:02:05,938
You definitely had a hard time.

32
00:02:05,938 --> 00:02:06,537
That's right.

33
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,098
Come, have something good

34
00:02:08,098 --> 00:02:08,858
to nourish your body.

35
00:02:13,657 --> 00:02:14,538
Ying, here.

36
00:02:15,617 --> 00:02:16,138
You!

37
00:02:20,298 --> 00:02:21,298
You grab everything.

38
00:02:25,777 --> 00:02:26,978
Miss Yu, this is for you.

39
00:02:27,138 --> 00:02:28,018
Here you are.

40
00:02:31,298 --> 00:02:32,298
I want the first one.

41
00:02:32,937 --> 00:02:33,897
No matter what,

42
00:02:34,098 --> 00:02:34,858
it's good that Xueying

43
00:02:35,018 --> 00:02:36,298
could come back safely this time.

44
00:02:36,578 --> 00:02:37,497
Our family

45
00:02:37,657 --> 00:02:38,978
can have a meal together again.

46
00:02:40,657 --> 00:02:42,378
Eat, eat. Don't be shy.

47
00:02:49,737 --> 00:02:50,337
Eat.

48
00:02:53,337 --> 00:02:54,937
Eat slowly, you two.

49
00:03:05,617 --> 00:03:06,217
Brother,

50
00:03:06,698 --> 00:03:08,018
will Ge Bin really come?

51
00:03:08,298 --> 00:03:08,978
I don't know.

52
00:03:08,978 --> 00:03:10,138
If we catch him,

53
00:03:10,457 --> 00:03:11,897
will we know
where our mother is being held?

54
00:03:12,018 --> 00:03:12,657
Yes.

55
00:03:13,057 --> 00:03:14,258
Then I must catch him.

56
00:03:15,777 --> 00:03:16,737
It is not as simple as

57
00:03:16,777 --> 00:03:17,457
you think.

58
00:03:20,177 --> 00:03:20,737
Brother,

59
00:03:21,897 --> 00:03:23,177
are you scared?

60
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:24,897
Yes.

61
00:03:26,378 --> 00:03:27,497
But being scared is useless.

62
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:29,937
I'm not scared.

63
00:03:30,937 --> 00:03:32,337
As long as I'm with you

64
00:03:32,657 --> 00:03:34,737
and we can find and save our mother,

65
00:03:35,098 --> 00:03:36,258
I'm not afraid of anything.

66
00:03:36,698 --> 00:03:37,457
So, brother,

67
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:39,057
you don't have to be scared, either.

68
00:03:56,015 --> 00:04:00,944
(Notice: Xueying got the Ocean Realm Stone
and was rewarded with a Black Iron Order)

69
00:04:43,297 --> 00:04:45,058
You practice spear so late every day.

70
00:04:46,297 --> 00:04:47,977
My talent is a bit worse than others.

71
00:04:48,537 --> 00:04:49,337
Until now, I still haven't

72
00:04:49,337 --> 00:04:50,217
developed any Dou Qi.

73
00:04:50,417 --> 00:04:51,698
So, I have to work harder.

74
00:04:52,097 --> 00:04:53,217
You're not worse.

75
00:04:53,657 --> 00:04:54,938
You can attack so fast

76
00:04:55,097 --> 00:04:56,018
with the spear

77
00:04:56,018 --> 00:04:56,938
without Dou Qi.

78
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:58,818
When your Dou Qi burst out one day,

79
00:04:58,938 --> 00:05:00,297
you will definitely be over ten times

80
00:05:00,297 --> 00:05:01,217
more powerful than normal people.

81
00:05:01,777 --> 00:05:02,897
Master He said

82
00:05:03,018 --> 00:05:04,097
your acupoints were sealed.

83
00:05:04,217 --> 00:05:05,258
Do you know the reason?

84
00:05:08,297 --> 00:05:09,618
No matter what the reason is,

85
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:11,498
I will keep working hard.

86
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:13,777
My mother once said,

87
00:05:15,258 --> 00:05:16,378
"If you keep going

88
00:05:16,498 --> 00:05:17,217
in one direction

89
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:19,178
for a year, two years,

90
00:05:19,297 --> 00:05:20,578
ten years, or twenty years,

91
00:05:20,977 --> 00:05:22,018
as long as you are determined,

92
00:05:22,378 --> 00:05:23,857
you will definitely
reach the destination."

93
00:05:25,378 --> 00:05:25,938
By the way,

94
00:05:26,657 --> 00:05:28,138
why don't you go to bed so late?

95
00:05:28,457 --> 00:05:29,977
Is it because
you're not used to this place?

96
00:05:32,297 --> 00:05:34,578
The war is imminent. I can't sleep.

97
00:05:35,337 --> 00:05:36,777
Xueying Territory is very good.

98
00:05:37,178 --> 00:05:38,977
I've grown up in a Daoist temple
since I was little.

99
00:05:39,217 --> 00:05:40,698
I think your home is very special.

100
00:05:40,857 --> 00:05:41,977
I can't describe it.

101
00:05:43,018 --> 00:05:45,258
Is it noisier than

102
00:05:45,417 --> 00:05:46,537
an ordinary household?

103
00:05:47,258 --> 00:05:49,058
It's not noisy. It's lively.

104
00:05:49,217 --> 00:05:50,217
This place is great.

105
00:05:53,178 --> 00:05:54,977
It was even livelier
when my parents were here.

106
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:57,097
This osmanthus tree
was planted by my mother.

107
00:05:57,818 --> 00:05:59,018
When it bloomed,

108
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:00,097
my mother would cook

109
00:06:00,258 --> 00:06:01,178
osmanthus cakes for us to eat.

110
00:06:02,097 --> 00:06:03,698
That's when it's the most beautiful.

111
00:06:04,818 --> 00:06:07,457
Unfortunately, it is not the season

112
00:06:07,537 --> 00:06:08,498
and the tree is still bare.

113
00:06:34,938 --> 00:06:36,417
This ice flowers have no color

114
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:37,417
or fragrance.

115
00:06:37,537 --> 00:06:38,618
They can't compare

116
00:06:38,738 --> 00:06:39,857
to real osmanthus.

117
00:06:50,938 --> 00:06:51,777
So beautiful.

118
00:06:53,897 --> 00:06:54,857
I hope we can successfully

119
00:06:54,857 --> 00:06:55,818
catch Ge Bin

120
00:06:56,417 --> 00:06:58,058
and you can save your mother.

121
00:07:30,498 --> 00:07:31,217
Ge Bin,

122
00:07:31,777 --> 00:07:33,337
we are waiting for you to come.

123
00:07:33,498 --> 00:07:34,738
Today, you won't escape!

124
00:07:34,897 --> 00:07:35,777
You brat,

125
00:07:36,097 --> 00:07:37,897
hand over the Ocean Realm Stone!

126
00:07:38,097 --> 00:07:39,058
Don't even dream about it.

127
00:07:39,297 --> 00:07:41,018
It's all because of you

128
00:07:41,938 --> 00:07:44,058
that I've become like this.

129
00:07:44,777 --> 00:07:45,578
Kid,

130
00:07:46,457 --> 00:07:47,818
I won't let you

131
00:07:47,818 --> 00:07:48,897
die easily today.

132
00:07:49,897 --> 00:07:51,537
I'll torture you slowly

133
00:07:51,938 --> 00:07:54,378
and watch you suffer and die slowly.

134
00:07:55,258 --> 00:07:56,097
Attack him!

135
00:08:40,258 --> 00:08:40,817
Jingqiu!

136
00:09:10,520 --> 00:09:12,679
(Cul-de-sac Attack)

137
00:09:27,618 --> 00:09:28,858
Prepare to die!

138
00:09:50,378 --> 00:09:50,937
Ying!

139
00:09:54,218 --> 00:09:54,738
Brother!

140
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:35,498
Shi!

141
00:10:43,057 --> 00:10:43,738
Impossible.

142
00:10:44,218 --> 00:10:44,978
Impossible.

143
00:10:45,297 --> 00:10:46,177
Could this kid

144
00:10:46,177 --> 00:10:47,618
be absorbing the energy
of heaven and earth?

145
00:10:50,618 --> 00:10:51,177
Brother.

146
00:10:52,258 --> 00:10:52,937
Don't go over there!

147
00:10:59,657 --> 00:11:00,738
Meteor Level!

148
00:11:00,897 --> 00:11:02,458
Ying finally unleashed his Dou Qi.

149
00:11:02,657 --> 00:11:03,297
What?

150
00:11:03,297 --> 00:11:04,417
He actually skipped

151
00:11:04,537 --> 00:11:05,537
the Heaven, Earth, and Man stages

152
00:11:05,537 --> 00:11:06,378
of Mortal Knights.

153
00:11:06,618 --> 00:11:07,537
Now he has the power

154
00:11:07,537 --> 00:11:09,378
of a Star-level Meteor Knight.

155
00:11:09,407 --> 00:11:11,736
(Dark Ice Spear Technique)

156
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:27,098
Run!

157
00:11:29,817 --> 00:11:31,417
I've already become a demon.

158
00:11:31,897 --> 00:11:34,098
Why can't I defeat you?

159
00:11:34,297 --> 00:11:35,697
It's just because you're a demon.

160
00:11:36,297 --> 00:11:37,417
Catch Ge Bin

161
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:38,417
and take him back.

162
00:11:43,018 --> 00:11:43,738
Jingqiu.

163
00:11:45,498 --> 00:11:46,098
Jingqiu.

164
00:11:47,177 --> 00:11:47,897
Let's go.

165
00:12:13,138 --> 00:12:13,697
Brother.

166
00:12:14,177 --> 00:12:14,858
Qingshi,

167
00:12:15,458 --> 00:12:16,218
you and Uncle Zong Ling

168
00:12:16,378 --> 00:12:17,378
take care of Uncle Tong San

169
00:12:17,577 --> 00:12:18,378
and Miss Yu.

170
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:20,258
I'll hand Ge Bin over
to Dragon Mountain Mansion.

171
00:12:20,338 --> 00:12:20,897
Brother,

172
00:12:21,098 --> 00:12:22,218
if you have news about our mother,

173
00:12:22,378 --> 00:12:23,098
come back immediately.

174
00:12:23,297 --> 00:12:24,657
I want to go with you
to save our mother.

175
00:12:26,338 --> 00:12:26,897
Wait for me.

176
00:12:28,218 --> 00:12:29,057
Be careful.

177
00:12:38,767 --> 00:12:40,280
(Dragon Mountain Mansion)

178
00:12:48,378 --> 00:12:49,258
Lord Si An,

179
00:12:49,657 --> 00:12:50,817
can you tell me now

180
00:12:50,937 --> 00:12:51,978
where my mother is?

181
00:12:52,258 --> 00:12:52,937
(This kid alone)

182
00:12:53,098 --> 00:12:54,417
(got back the Ocean Realm Stone)

183
00:12:54,577 --> 00:12:55,378
(and caught Ge Bin,)

184
00:12:55,498 --> 00:12:56,297
(the fierce bandit.)

185
00:12:56,458 --> 00:12:57,417
(He's no longer the little boy)

186
00:12:57,577 --> 00:12:58,978
(who cried and sniveled)

187
00:12:59,138 --> 00:12:59,937
(back then.)

188
00:13:00,338 --> 00:13:01,657
(It seems he's already far beyond)

189
00:13:01,817 --> 00:13:02,978
(what I know of him.)

190
00:13:04,897 --> 00:13:05,417
Okay,

191
00:13:05,937 --> 00:13:06,657
wait a moment.

192
00:13:28,417 --> 00:13:29,297
Where is this?

193
00:13:30,177 --> 00:13:31,417
She's locked up in Moyang Chen's

194
00:13:31,417 --> 00:13:32,657
secret cultivation palace.

195
00:13:33,177 --> 00:13:35,138
The easternmost place by the sea,
Leichao Sea Cliff.

196
00:13:37,218 --> 00:13:38,417
Leichao Sea Cliff.

197
00:13:39,338 --> 00:13:40,417
Thank you, Lord Si An.

198
00:13:43,177 --> 00:13:44,218
He didn't even ask
what Leichao Sea Cliff

199
00:13:44,218 --> 00:13:45,177
was like.

200
00:13:45,458 --> 00:13:46,978
That place seems magnificent,

201
00:13:47,138 --> 00:13:48,498
but is dangerously magical.

202
00:13:49,577 --> 00:13:51,057
And Moyang Chen's barrier

203
00:13:51,218 --> 00:13:52,657
is not something he can handle.

204
00:13:52,897 --> 00:13:54,417
Leichao Sea Cliff is indeed dangerous.

205
00:13:55,098 --> 00:13:56,018
He might just be

206
00:13:56,537 --> 00:13:58,498
fearless as a young man.

207
00:13:58,777 --> 00:13:59,777
But Leichao Sea Cliff

208
00:13:59,897 --> 00:14:00,697
is not a place that can be stormed

209
00:14:00,817 --> 00:14:02,057
by relying on

210
00:14:02,177 --> 00:14:03,218
his courage

211
00:14:03,297 --> 00:14:04,618
and a bit of luck.

212
00:14:08,258 --> 00:14:08,858
Brother,

213
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:11,177
did you deliver Ge Bin

214
00:14:11,338 --> 00:14:12,018
to Dragon Mountain Mansion?

215
00:14:13,057 --> 00:14:13,897
Where is our mother?

216
00:14:14,098 --> 00:14:14,817
Did they tell you?

217
00:14:15,018 --> 00:14:16,018
The Mansion Master...

218
00:14:16,498 --> 00:14:17,417
(If I tell them)

219
00:14:17,417 --> 00:14:18,338
(where my mother is held,)

220
00:14:18,537 --> 00:14:20,018
(they'll definitely go with me.)

221
00:14:20,498 --> 00:14:21,817
(Moyang Chen is highly skilled
in martial arts.)

222
00:14:21,858 --> 00:14:23,338
(I can't let them
take the risk with me.)

223
00:14:23,537 --> 00:14:25,018
(It's better for me to go alone.)

224
00:14:25,297 --> 00:14:27,098
Brother, just tell us.

225
00:14:27,378 --> 00:14:28,738
He didn't reveal our mother's location.

226
00:14:28,978 --> 00:14:29,897
Why?

227
00:14:30,057 --> 00:14:31,577
We have captured Ge Bin.

228
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:32,378
Is it because

229
00:14:32,378 --> 00:14:33,618
they don't know where our mother is?

230
00:14:33,777 --> 00:14:35,177
They're going back on their word.

231
00:14:36,258 --> 00:14:37,177
I'll confront them.

232
00:14:37,537 --> 00:14:38,218
Uncle Tong.

233
00:14:38,577 --> 00:14:39,777
Let Ying finish his words.

234
00:14:40,937 --> 00:14:41,937
Xueying, tell us.

235
00:14:42,258 --> 00:14:43,817
If they take advantage of their power,

236
00:14:43,978 --> 00:14:45,177
I'm not going to be polite, either.

237
00:14:47,858 --> 00:14:49,138
Although Ge Bin is captured now,

238
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:50,458
we still haven't figured out

239
00:14:50,458 --> 00:14:51,378
the plan of the Demon Clan.

240
00:14:51,697 --> 00:14:52,738
Once we find out the truth,

241
00:14:52,897 --> 00:14:53,618
I think

242
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,458
he'll tell me where our mother is.

243
00:14:55,618 --> 00:14:57,098
They asked you to capture Ge Bin

244
00:14:57,258 --> 00:14:58,618
after you got the Black Iron Order.

245
00:14:58,897 --> 00:15:00,057
Now that Ge Bin is captured,

246
00:15:00,138 --> 00:15:00,498
why...?

247
00:15:00,498 --> 00:15:01,138
Uncle Zong Ling,

248
00:15:01,657 --> 00:15:02,978
you know the rules

249
00:15:03,018 --> 00:15:03,897
of Dragon Mountain Mansion.

250
00:15:04,177 --> 00:15:05,297
Give them some time.

251
00:15:05,697 --> 00:15:06,297
Brother,

252
00:15:06,618 --> 00:15:07,297
when the time comes,

253
00:15:07,297 --> 00:15:08,378
I want to go with you

254
00:15:08,657 --> 00:15:09,817
to kill Moyang Chen

255
00:15:10,018 --> 00:15:11,098
and avenge our father.

256
00:15:11,738 --> 00:15:12,498
I'll go, too.

257
00:15:12,858 --> 00:15:14,057
The old Lord and Lady

258
00:15:14,057 --> 00:15:15,098
were very kind to me.

259
00:15:15,338 --> 00:15:16,458
Their enemies

260
00:15:16,618 --> 00:15:18,057
are my enemies.

261
00:15:19,657 --> 00:15:21,057
If there's nothing else,
I'll go back first.

262
00:15:23,738 --> 00:15:25,458
(Luckily, I didn't mention
Leichao Sea Cliff.)

263
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,618
(Qingshi, Uncle Tong San, Uncle Zong,)

264
00:15:29,537 --> 00:15:30,338
(I'm sorry.)

265
00:15:33,475 --> 00:15:35,196
(Map of Dragon Mountain Empire)

266
00:15:41,378 --> 00:15:42,777
(It's too far down the road.)

267
00:15:43,338 --> 00:15:44,458
(It's better to take the shortcut)

268
00:15:44,458 --> 00:15:45,618
(through Lengqiong Mountain.)

269
00:15:46,537 --> 00:15:47,738
(However, I heard that this mountain)

270
00:15:47,897 --> 00:15:48,978
(is infested with bandits)

271
00:15:49,177 --> 00:15:50,338
(who often rob merchants.)

272
00:15:51,378 --> 00:15:52,777
(But I don't look like)

273
00:15:52,777 --> 00:15:54,018
(I have any wealth to be robbed.)

274
00:15:54,218 --> 00:15:55,417
(So it should be fine.)

275
00:15:55,446 --> 00:15:57,336
(Leichao Sea Cliff)

276
00:15:59,817 --> 00:16:00,577
Ying.

277
00:16:02,338 --> 00:16:03,177
Ying.

278
00:16:05,057 --> 00:16:05,657
Uncle Zong Ling.

279
00:16:05,657 --> 00:16:07,138
Here, take this medicine.

280
00:16:08,817 --> 00:16:09,657
Again?

281
00:16:09,858 --> 00:16:11,697
This time, you unleashed your Dou Qi

282
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,378
and had a fierce battle with Ge Bin.

283
00:16:13,537 --> 00:16:15,057
Your Dou Qi is chaotic inside your body.

284
00:16:15,218 --> 00:16:16,577
This medicine can help you

285
00:16:16,577 --> 00:16:17,577
stabilize your inner power.

286
00:16:17,817 --> 00:16:18,458
Okay.

287
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:23,417
Thank you, Uncle Zong Ling.

288
00:16:24,458 --> 00:16:26,098
I also gave Miss Yu a dose.

289
00:16:26,537 --> 00:16:27,378
She has woken up?

290
00:16:27,817 --> 00:16:28,738
How's her injury?

291
00:16:29,657 --> 00:16:30,937
After she took the herbal medicine,

292
00:16:30,937 --> 00:16:32,458
her power should gradually recover.

293
00:16:32,577 --> 00:16:34,018
However, she is

294
00:16:34,177 --> 00:16:34,858
falling asleep

295
00:16:34,858 --> 00:16:35,577
and waking up intermittently.

296
00:16:35,777 --> 00:16:37,177
Luckily, her life is not in danger.

297
00:16:38,218 --> 00:16:38,937
That's good.

298
00:16:40,138 --> 00:16:41,537
Please take good care of her.

299
00:16:44,657 --> 00:16:45,577
Is there anything else?

300
00:16:48,378 --> 00:16:49,258
No.

301
00:16:49,417 --> 00:16:50,258
I just don't know

302
00:16:50,697 --> 00:16:52,417
how to take care of girls.

303
00:16:54,458 --> 00:16:55,258
Well,

304
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:56,777
you used to take care of Shi very well,

305
00:16:56,978 --> 00:16:58,297
feeding him and rubbing his back.

306
00:16:58,498 --> 00:16:59,417
You were very careful.

307
00:16:59,577 --> 00:17:01,417
It's because Shi is my younger brother.

308
00:17:01,817 --> 00:17:02,458
That's true.

309
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:05,178
Miss Yu will be fine.

310
00:17:05,178 --> 00:17:06,498
Don't worry, and get some rest early.

311
00:17:06,537 --> 00:17:07,097
Alright.

312
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:37,698
(I wonder)

313
00:17:38,297 --> 00:17:39,777
(when we can meet again.)

314
00:17:40,498 --> 00:17:41,137
Miss Yu,

315
00:17:42,018 --> 00:17:43,418
I hope you recover soon.

316
00:17:55,599 --> 00:17:59,001
(Xueying Territory)

317
00:17:59,258 --> 00:18:00,377
Do not tell others about this.

318
00:18:00,738 --> 00:18:01,377
Yes.

319
00:18:06,735 --> 00:18:09,916
(Xueying Territory)

320
00:18:13,097 --> 00:18:14,258
Dongbo Xueying

321
00:18:14,258 --> 00:18:15,617
is truly a great hero.

322
00:18:15,817 --> 00:18:16,817
He slayed a demon.

323
00:18:17,018 --> 00:18:17,738
From now on,

324
00:18:17,738 --> 00:18:18,377
we won't be afraid of

325
00:18:18,377 --> 00:18:19,218
being harmed by demons.

326
00:18:19,218 --> 00:18:19,898
Indeed.

327
00:18:20,018 --> 00:18:20,978
I also heard

328
00:18:20,978 --> 00:18:22,178
that he is young and talented.

329
00:18:22,337 --> 00:18:23,377
At such a young age,

330
00:18:23,498 --> 00:18:25,297
he's already the Lord
of the Xueying Territory.

331
00:18:25,658 --> 00:18:26,738
Speaking of which,

332
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:28,297
he actually had a rough life before.

333
00:18:28,498 --> 00:18:29,898
(Kong Hai)
He lost his parents when he was little.

334
00:18:29,938 --> 00:18:30,738
At that time,

335
00:18:30,738 --> 00:18:31,577
he was just

336
00:18:31,658 --> 00:18:32,577
a poor kid.

337
00:18:33,337 --> 00:18:34,537
Anyway...

338
00:18:35,898 --> 00:18:37,577
Dongbo Xueying?

339
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:40,218
Lord of Xueying Territory?

340
00:18:41,938 --> 00:18:44,418
They are talking about Dongbo Lie's son.

341
00:18:46,057 --> 00:18:46,577
Well...

342
00:18:48,097 --> 00:18:49,617
Go away! My master is not home.

343
00:18:50,057 --> 00:18:51,817
Sir! Sir!

344
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:53,498
Leave quickly! Don't make a fuss here!

345
00:18:53,817 --> 00:18:56,458
(Kong Mansion)
Kong Mansion doesn't welcome beggars.

346
00:18:56,658 --> 00:18:57,577
It's me!

347
00:18:57,658 --> 00:18:59,337
Tong San, the commander
of the Xueying Territory.

348
00:18:59,337 --> 00:19:00,418
I told you to leave!

349
00:19:00,777 --> 00:19:02,258
Do you know whose house this is?

350
00:19:02,297 --> 00:19:03,418
How dare you talk nonsense right here?

351
00:19:03,617 --> 00:19:04,738
Xueying Territory?

352
00:19:04,938 --> 00:19:06,337
It has fallen into such a state.

353
00:19:06,698 --> 00:19:08,337
And you are a commander?

354
00:19:08,738 --> 00:19:09,777
Who do you command?

355
00:19:11,018 --> 00:19:14,057
Kong Hai, you coward!

356
00:19:14,898 --> 00:19:17,658
Dongbo Xueying, who has a ruined family,

357
00:19:20,018 --> 00:19:22,377
has surpassed his own father?

358
00:19:24,617 --> 00:19:25,978
(Up to now,)

359
00:19:26,178 --> 00:19:27,178
(Dongbo Xueying)

360
00:19:27,178 --> 00:19:28,617
(is no longer
what he liked in the past.)

361
00:19:28,698 --> 00:19:29,777
(I must choose an auspicious day)

362
00:19:29,777 --> 00:19:31,178
(and take Yue to meet)

363
00:19:31,178 --> 00:19:32,658
(my future son-in-law.)

364
00:19:50,418 --> 00:19:51,178
Miss,

365
00:19:51,377 --> 00:19:52,018
we have earned

366
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,097
so much money this time.

367
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:56,178
(Kong Youyue)
Bitao, don't talk to me for now.

368
00:19:56,377 --> 00:19:57,537
Let me clear up

369
00:19:57,537 --> 00:19:58,658
this account book.

370
00:19:59,458 --> 00:20:00,577
Alright.

371
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,258
Finally, it's all clear.

372
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:13,258
When I go back,

373
00:20:13,258 --> 00:20:14,418
I can report to my father.

374
00:20:14,418 --> 00:20:15,297
During this trip,

375
00:20:15,377 --> 00:20:16,537
we really earned a lot.

376
00:20:16,658 --> 00:20:17,617
Miss,

377
00:20:17,817 --> 00:20:19,377
you don't even need paper and brush.

378
00:20:19,537 --> 00:20:20,577
Just by looking,

379
00:20:20,777 --> 00:20:21,777
you can calculate everything?

380
00:20:22,337 --> 00:20:24,297
It's all memorized in my head.

381
00:20:24,498 --> 00:20:26,057
I really admire you.

382
00:20:26,258 --> 00:20:27,938
If I were half as good as you,

383
00:20:28,137 --> 00:20:28,938
that would be great.

384
00:20:29,178 --> 00:20:30,498
Silly girl.

385
00:20:30,698 --> 00:20:32,258
You don't like doing business.

386
00:20:32,458 --> 00:20:34,057
What's the use
of the mental arithmetic skill

387
00:20:34,258 --> 00:20:35,018
to you?

388
00:20:35,658 --> 00:20:36,777
You're right, Miss.

389
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,577
As long as you can do it,

390
00:20:38,698 --> 00:20:40,218
I can just follow you.

391
00:20:41,938 --> 00:20:43,337
Well, Miss,

392
00:20:43,458 --> 00:20:44,658
this time,

393
00:20:44,658 --> 00:20:45,978
we're secretly transporting goods.

394
00:20:46,218 --> 00:20:48,377
But we are still traveling
through Lengqiong Mountain.

395
00:20:48,658 --> 00:20:50,617
It is said that,
because of Lengqiong Mountain,

396
00:20:50,658 --> 00:20:51,698
ordinary merchants

397
00:20:51,698 --> 00:20:53,097
need to gather around a hundred people

398
00:20:53,097 --> 00:20:54,337
to take this route.

399
00:20:54,658 --> 00:20:56,698
If your father finds out
when we go back,

400
00:20:56,898 --> 00:20:58,537
he will definitely punish me.

401
00:20:59,018 --> 00:20:59,978
Tell me.

402
00:20:59,978 --> 00:21:02,178
Is the scenery
of Lengqiong Mountain Grand Canyon

403
00:21:02,258 --> 00:21:03,097
beautiful?

404
00:21:05,577 --> 00:21:06,817
Beautiful it is,

405
00:21:07,297 --> 00:21:08,337
but...

406
00:21:08,537 --> 00:21:10,458
Then just enjoy it in peace.

407
00:21:10,617 --> 00:21:11,777
No "but".

408
00:21:12,617 --> 00:21:13,978
If my father should punish someone,

409
00:21:14,018 --> 00:21:15,218
it should be me.

410
00:21:16,337 --> 00:21:17,297
Besides,

411
00:21:17,777 --> 00:21:19,178
you don't need to worry.

412
00:21:19,857 --> 00:21:21,658
My father would be
reluctant to punish me.

413
00:21:26,857 --> 00:21:27,537
What's going on?

414
00:21:27,537 --> 00:21:28,857
We've encountered robbers.

415
00:21:32,498 --> 00:21:33,498
Protect the Miss!

416
00:21:35,978 --> 00:21:37,817
There is a young woman.

417
00:21:38,137 --> 00:21:39,178
Who are you?

418
00:21:39,418 --> 00:21:40,777
Why are you blocking our way?

419
00:21:41,297 --> 00:21:42,137
Buddies,

420
00:21:42,498 --> 00:21:43,617
the money is yours.

421
00:21:43,738 --> 00:21:46,418
But this young woman is mine.

422
00:21:47,577 --> 00:21:48,738
Shameless!

423
00:21:49,458 --> 00:21:51,178
If you want to pass
through Lengqiong Mountain,

424
00:21:51,337 --> 00:21:52,418
leave us all your belongings

425
00:21:52,418 --> 00:21:53,537
and the young woman!

426
00:21:53,738 --> 00:21:55,258
Take us to Yishui City.

427
00:21:55,458 --> 00:21:56,537
You can go back with me
to get the money.

428
00:21:56,978 --> 00:21:58,577
I'll give you as much money

429
00:21:58,777 --> 00:21:59,777
as you want.

430
00:22:00,218 --> 00:22:01,498
Quite arrogant.

431
00:22:01,658 --> 00:22:03,018
Since when did we Lengqiong Eight Eagles

432
00:22:03,097 --> 00:22:04,738
become bodyguards?

433
00:22:04,938 --> 00:22:06,498
Escort you to Yishui City?

434
00:22:06,537 --> 00:22:08,057
Why don't you ask us
to escort you to yamen?

435
00:22:08,178 --> 00:22:10,018
Are you treating me like a fool?

436
00:22:10,137 --> 00:22:11,777
Stop talking nonsense with them, Bro.

437
00:22:11,898 --> 00:22:12,938
Attack!

438
00:22:12,938 --> 00:22:13,577
Attack!

439
00:22:26,057 --> 00:22:26,698
Bitao!

440
00:22:28,418 --> 00:22:29,178
Don't move.

441
00:22:30,377 --> 00:22:31,097
- Let go of me!
- Buddies,

442
00:22:31,178 --> 00:22:32,137
take their belongings

443
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:33,097
and tie up the women.

444
00:22:33,097 --> 00:22:34,258
Kill them after we have enough fun.

445
00:22:34,537 --> 00:22:35,258
Let go of me!

446
00:22:35,498 --> 00:22:36,018
- Go!
- Let go of me!

447
00:22:36,057 --> 00:22:37,418
Let go of me! Help!

448
00:22:39,978 --> 00:22:40,978
Help!

449
00:22:42,418 --> 00:22:43,178
Let go of me!

450
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:44,698
Help!

451
00:22:46,258 --> 00:22:47,377
- Let go!
- Get in!

452
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:50,857
Let go of me!

453
00:23:13,738 --> 00:23:14,498
Let go of them!

454
00:24:07,978 --> 00:24:08,698
Watch out!

455
00:24:27,498 --> 00:24:28,018
Go!

456
00:24:28,057 --> 00:24:29,218
Go, hurry up!

457
00:24:32,458 --> 00:24:34,498
Miss, are you okay?

458
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:35,498
I'm fine.

459
00:24:35,698 --> 00:24:36,777
We're safe now.

460
00:24:36,978 --> 00:24:38,418
You go untie them.

461
00:24:38,857 --> 00:24:39,537
Okay.

462
00:24:41,057 --> 00:24:42,418
Thank you for your rescue.

463
00:24:42,738 --> 00:24:43,377
You're welcome.

464
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:45,537
There are bandits rampant here.

465
00:24:45,738 --> 00:24:46,817
You don't know any martial arts.

466
00:24:46,817 --> 00:24:48,057
How dare you take this route?

467
00:24:48,738 --> 00:24:50,898
We just passed by with the goods.

468
00:24:50,898 --> 00:24:51,698
I didn't expect this place

469
00:24:51,698 --> 00:24:52,938
to be so dangerous.

470
00:24:53,218 --> 00:24:54,817
Next time, be sure to know the situation

471
00:24:54,857 --> 00:24:56,258
and choose a safe route.

472
00:24:58,097 --> 00:24:58,898
Please hurry on your way.

473
00:24:59,057 --> 00:25:00,218
It'll be safe once you enter the city.

474
00:25:00,418 --> 00:25:01,097
Be careful on the road.

475
00:25:10,337 --> 00:25:11,097
Miss.

476
00:25:12,258 --> 00:25:13,857
He has already gone so far,

477
00:25:13,978 --> 00:25:15,258
yet you're still reluctant to leave?

478
00:25:15,377 --> 00:25:16,577
Nonsense.

479
00:25:16,698 --> 00:25:17,498
It's because

480
00:25:17,617 --> 00:25:19,018
he just saved our lives.

481
00:25:19,938 --> 00:25:20,658
Oh no,

482
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:22,658
I forgot to ask his name.

483
00:25:24,097 --> 00:25:24,938
I don't even know

484
00:25:24,938 --> 00:25:26,057
what his name is.

485
00:25:26,218 --> 00:25:27,057
Bitao,

486
00:25:27,178 --> 00:25:28,617
why didn't you remind me?

487
00:25:28,738 --> 00:25:30,458
Miss, as long as there's fate,

488
00:25:30,577 --> 00:25:31,658
you'll meet again.

489
00:25:32,857 --> 00:25:34,137
In such a vast world,

490
00:25:34,337 --> 00:25:36,297
how can it be easy to meet again?

491
00:25:38,178 --> 00:25:38,938
Miss,

492
00:25:39,097 --> 00:25:40,458
you still want to see him again,
don't you?

493
00:25:41,698 --> 00:25:42,898
Bitao.

494
00:25:45,097 --> 00:25:45,857
Forget it.

495
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,777
Let's hurry on our way

496
00:25:48,137 --> 00:25:49,817
and leave Lengqiong Mountain
as soon as possible.

497
00:26:11,658 --> 00:26:13,178
(Will we meet again?)

498
00:26:17,817 --> 00:26:18,537
Ying!

499
00:26:23,018 --> 00:26:23,777
Ying!

500
00:26:26,817 --> 00:26:27,617
Ying!

501
00:26:36,498 --> 00:26:37,617
Leichao Sea Cliff?

502
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:39,658
Ying, it's time to have a meal.

503
00:26:39,658 --> 00:26:40,258
Tong San.

504
00:26:41,577 --> 00:26:43,218
Ying went to save his mother by himself.

505
00:26:43,777 --> 00:26:44,498
What?

506
00:26:44,817 --> 00:26:46,258
When I gave him the medicine yesterday,

507
00:26:46,377 --> 00:26:47,537
he wore an unnatural expression.

508
00:26:48,577 --> 00:26:49,537
He must be afraid that we

509
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:50,898
would take risk with him.

510
00:26:54,018 --> 00:26:55,458
Why are you pulling me?

511
00:26:55,617 --> 00:26:56,817
We can't let Shi know.

512
00:26:57,057 --> 00:26:58,458
Otherwise, he'll want to go with us.

513
00:26:58,458 --> 00:26:59,777
Then you come up with an idea.

514
00:27:00,458 --> 00:27:02,297
You come up with an idea!

515
00:27:02,817 --> 00:27:03,498
I got it.

516
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:05,617
We'll say we're going to
the Dragon Mountain Mansion

517
00:27:05,738 --> 00:27:07,258
and ask him to stay
and take care of Miss Yu.

518
00:27:08,418 --> 00:27:09,057
Let's go.

519
00:27:10,287 --> 00:27:12,267
(Leichao Sea Cliff)

520
00:27:17,647 --> 00:27:19,231
(Leichao Sea Cliff)

521
00:27:20,137 --> 00:27:20,698
(Mother,)

522
00:27:21,137 --> 00:27:21,857
(I'm coming.)

523
00:27:22,337 --> 00:27:23,337
(Wait for me.)

524
00:28:55,978 --> 00:28:56,537
Mother,

525
00:28:57,898 --> 00:28:58,658
is that you?

526
00:29:06,698 --> 00:29:07,377
Mother!

527
00:29:10,137 --> 00:29:10,857
Mother!

528
00:29:16,658 --> 00:29:18,498
Xueying, is that you? Xueying.

529
00:29:22,617 --> 00:29:23,218
Mother,

530
00:29:23,617 --> 00:29:24,418
I'm here to save you.

531
00:29:47,218 --> 00:29:47,817
Xueying!

532
00:29:48,418 --> 00:29:49,857
Xueying, you must be careful!

533
00:29:49,857 --> 00:29:50,658
Xueying!

534
00:29:57,658 --> 00:29:58,537
Xueying!

535
00:30:20,817 --> 00:30:21,978
Silly child,

536
00:30:22,498 --> 00:30:24,057
who told you to come?

537
00:30:24,698 --> 00:30:25,817
Leave quickly!

538
00:30:27,857 --> 00:30:29,018
Xueying!

539
00:30:31,857 --> 00:30:32,577
Mother.

540
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:34,178
Mother.

541
00:30:47,698 --> 00:30:48,537
Finally,

542
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:51,377
I can hear my mother's voice again.

543
00:31:49,337 --> 00:31:50,978
Xueying, don't!

544
00:31:51,337 --> 00:31:52,537
Xueying!

545
00:32:38,097 --> 00:32:38,938
Xueying.

546
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:53,898
Are you hurt?

547
00:32:54,097 --> 00:32:55,698
Quick, get up!

548
00:32:55,857 --> 00:32:57,337
I finally found you.

549
00:32:58,097 --> 00:33:00,458
Stand up. Let me see you.

550
00:33:02,577 --> 00:33:04,738
Stand up. Let me see you.

551
00:33:07,057 --> 00:33:07,658
Mother.

552
00:33:12,498 --> 00:33:13,258
My child.

553
00:33:13,857 --> 00:33:14,498
My child.

554
00:33:15,258 --> 00:33:15,898
Don't!

555
00:33:16,258 --> 00:33:16,938
Xueying.

556
00:33:17,377 --> 00:33:18,817
Listen to me. Don't!

557
00:33:19,938 --> 00:33:21,577
Xueying, don't!

558
00:33:21,738 --> 00:33:23,018
Don't, Xueying!

559
00:33:24,698 --> 00:33:25,617
(Xueying has)

560
00:33:25,617 --> 00:33:26,698
(such strong Dou Qi.)

561
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:28,978
(Silver Moon Level
is nothing more than this.)

562
00:33:55,698 --> 00:33:56,777
My Xueying

563
00:33:57,297 --> 00:33:58,498
has grown up so much.

564
00:33:58,978 --> 00:33:59,617
Mother,

565
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:01,498
I'll take you home.

566
00:34:05,418 --> 00:34:06,137
Xueying,

567
00:34:06,617 --> 00:34:07,498
listen to me.

568
00:34:08,257 --> 00:34:09,978
As long as you're fine,

569
00:34:10,858 --> 00:34:12,338
I will be at ease.

570
00:34:12,778 --> 00:34:13,378
Xueying,

571
00:34:14,057 --> 00:34:15,617
my good child.

572
00:34:16,617 --> 00:34:17,577
Let's go home.

573
00:34:20,217 --> 00:34:21,018
Let's go home.

574
00:34:22,938 --> 00:34:24,697
My little Xueying.

575
00:34:33,697 --> 00:34:34,338
Xueying!

576
00:34:37,097 --> 00:34:38,577
It's you?

577
00:34:39,137 --> 00:34:40,458
You brat.

578
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:42,057
I haven't seen you for ten years.

579
00:34:42,697 --> 00:34:44,537
You managed to break into my place?

580
00:34:44,617 --> 00:34:45,418
I'll kill you!

581
00:34:45,418 --> 00:34:46,217
Listen to me.

582
00:34:47,137 --> 00:34:48,858
Xueying! Xueying!

583
00:35:01,057 --> 00:35:03,018
Xueying! Xueying!

584
00:35:05,778 --> 00:35:06,537
Xueying!

585
00:35:08,097 --> 00:35:09,378
Xueying, good child,

586
00:35:09,577 --> 00:35:10,577
listen to me.

587
00:35:12,257 --> 00:35:13,137
Your life

588
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:15,577
is my life.

589
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:18,378
Live well

590
00:35:20,137 --> 00:35:21,378
and don't come to save me again.

591
00:35:21,378 --> 00:35:22,338
Did you hear me?

592
00:35:22,898 --> 00:35:23,577
No.

593
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:28,537
Moyang Chen,

594
00:35:29,137 --> 00:35:29,858
there's nothing you want

595
00:35:29,858 --> 00:35:31,217
on my son's body.

596
00:35:32,298 --> 00:35:33,938
You don't have to be so cruel.

597
00:35:34,778 --> 00:35:36,577
Give me what I want

598
00:35:38,217 --> 00:35:39,858
and I'll spare your son's life.

599
00:35:43,217 --> 00:35:44,257
My child.

600
00:35:45,577 --> 00:35:46,737
My child.

601
00:35:50,938 --> 00:35:51,657
My child.

602
00:36:33,617 --> 00:36:35,498
Didn't you say during the great battle,

603
00:36:35,657 --> 00:36:36,938
your Ancient Bloodline

604
00:36:37,097 --> 00:36:38,858
had already exhausted and weakened?

605
00:36:39,217 --> 00:36:41,137
Now it can work again?

606
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:43,378
Tell me, has your Ancient Bloodline

607
00:36:43,458 --> 00:36:44,458
recovered?

608
00:36:45,898 --> 00:36:47,418
If it had recovered,

609
00:36:48,338 --> 00:36:50,378
you'd be the first one I'd kill.

610
00:36:50,537 --> 00:36:51,177
You!

611
00:36:57,378 --> 00:36:58,137
Yu,

612
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,617
we were siblings.

613
00:37:01,898 --> 00:37:03,257
Why won't you tell me

614
00:37:03,418 --> 00:37:06,018
the secret
of awakening the Ancient Bloodline?

615
00:37:06,577 --> 00:37:08,257
You colluded with the Demon Clan.

616
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:12,378
Lie also died at your hands.

617
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,737
We're no longer siblings.

618
00:37:18,617 --> 00:37:19,458
As long as

619
00:37:19,898 --> 00:37:20,458
I possess

620
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:21,898
the power of the Ancient Bloodline

621
00:37:22,057 --> 00:37:23,418
and master the most powerful
martial arts in the world,

622
00:37:23,577 --> 00:37:24,257
I can become the most powerful person

623
00:37:24,257 --> 00:37:24,978
in the world.

624
00:37:25,097 --> 00:37:26,057
I promise

625
00:37:26,217 --> 00:37:27,657
not to contact the Demon Clan anymore.

626
00:37:30,378 --> 00:37:31,577
If it's not for your family,

627
00:37:32,498 --> 00:37:33,577
not for justice,

628
00:37:34,617 --> 00:37:36,617
what's the use
of being the most powerful person?

629
00:37:37,298 --> 00:37:38,298
What's the use?

630
00:37:39,177 --> 00:37:41,418
Since you're so heartless,

631
00:37:41,778 --> 00:37:43,458
don't blame me.

632
00:38:10,938 --> 00:38:11,898
- Ying!
- Ying!

633
00:38:12,858 --> 00:38:13,657
Ying!

634
00:38:14,097 --> 00:38:14,898
Ying!

635
00:38:15,737 --> 00:38:16,378
Ying!

636
00:38:17,217 --> 00:38:18,177
It's not suitable to stay here for long.

637
00:38:18,177 --> 00:38:18,818
Let's leave first.

638
00:38:18,818 --> 00:38:19,378
Go.

639
00:38:43,056 --> 00:38:44,949
(Blessings and Auspices)

640
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:02,778
Jingqiu,

641
00:39:03,257 --> 00:39:04,057
you're awake.

642
00:39:05,257 --> 00:39:06,418
Why didn't I see Xueying

643
00:39:06,418 --> 00:39:07,458
and your uncles?

644
00:39:08,018 --> 00:39:09,257
They went
to the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

645
00:39:09,858 --> 00:39:10,818
Dragon Mountain Mansion?

646
00:39:11,418 --> 00:39:12,418
What about Ge Bin?

647
00:39:12,577 --> 00:39:13,537
He has also been sent

648
00:39:13,657 --> 00:39:14,737
to the Dragon Mountain Mansion
by my brother.

649
00:39:15,858 --> 00:39:17,018
(Did Ge Bin confess)

650
00:39:17,177 --> 00:39:18,298
(the plans of the Demon Clan?)

651
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:19,418
(I need to go and see.)

652
00:39:20,498 --> 00:39:21,617
Thank you for taking care of me.

653
00:39:21,737 --> 00:39:22,298
I still have things to do,

654
00:39:22,418 --> 00:39:23,338
so I'll take my leave first.

655
00:39:23,858 --> 00:39:24,537
Wait.

656
00:39:25,617 --> 00:39:26,898
J-Jingqiu,

657
00:39:28,498 --> 00:39:30,378
when you have time,

658
00:39:30,898 --> 00:39:32,498
can you teach me some spells?

659
00:39:33,217 --> 00:39:34,498
My own skills are shallow.

660
00:39:34,657 --> 00:39:35,617
How can I teach you?

661
00:39:35,778 --> 00:39:36,418
When you have the chance,

662
00:39:36,537 --> 00:39:37,737
you should find
a great mage to learn from.

663
00:39:37,858 --> 00:39:39,338
Your spells are considered shallow?

664
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:40,737
Then what a real mage

665
00:39:40,898 --> 00:39:41,737
is like?

666
00:39:42,378 --> 00:39:43,938
You'll know when you see one.

667
00:39:44,097 --> 00:39:44,938
I'm leaving then.

668
00:39:47,217 --> 00:39:48,458
Take care, Jingqiu!

669
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:55,778
Why did the Demon Clan

670
00:39:55,938 --> 00:39:56,858
want to use the Ocean Realm Stone

671
00:39:56,858 --> 00:39:57,737
to create demons?

672
00:39:58,498 --> 00:40:00,338
If I were in the Demon God Association,

673
00:40:00,498 --> 00:40:02,657
I would turn you into a demon first.

674
00:40:02,818 --> 00:40:05,137
Little girl, your skin is so tender.

675
00:40:05,458 --> 00:40:07,617
I will turn you into a lantern!

676
00:40:12,458 --> 00:40:13,818
If you don't confess,

677
00:40:14,498 --> 00:40:15,217
I have plenty of ways

678
00:40:15,217 --> 00:40:17,018
to make you wish you were dead.

679
00:40:19,617 --> 00:40:21,898
I-I-I'll tell you.

680
00:40:22,057 --> 00:40:24,057
I'll tell you everything I know.

681
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:26,378
Go ahead.

682
00:40:27,338 --> 00:40:28,657
All I know is

683
00:40:29,057 --> 00:40:31,858
the Demon God Association
asked me to create demons.

684
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:33,097
I really don't know

685
00:40:33,298 --> 00:40:34,657
what the demons are for.

686
00:40:34,858 --> 00:40:36,898
It's always been a gray-robed elder

687
00:40:37,057 --> 00:40:38,217
who has been in contact with me.

688
00:40:38,697 --> 00:40:40,818
He must know more than I do.

689
00:40:41,818 --> 00:40:43,097
A gray-robed elder?

690
00:40:43,217 --> 00:40:43,938
Yes.

691
00:40:44,898 --> 00:40:46,378
He is the Demon God Association's

692
00:40:46,657 --> 00:40:49,018
informant in the Bent Blade Union.

693
00:40:49,338 --> 00:40:50,778
I've always been listening to him

694
00:40:50,938 --> 00:40:52,378
conveying orders from above.

695
00:40:52,498 --> 00:40:52,978
Other than that,

696
00:40:53,057 --> 00:40:54,858
I don't know anything.

697
00:40:55,378 --> 00:40:56,018
Enough.

698
00:40:56,858 --> 00:40:58,378
He's told us everything he knows.

699
00:40:58,657 --> 00:41:00,018
We can't get anything more out of him.

700
00:41:02,537 --> 00:41:03,577
Let's go out first.

701
00:41:04,097 --> 00:41:04,778
Yes.

702
00:41:12,577 --> 00:41:14,617
I was injured and fell into a coma
due to Ge Bin's attack.

703
00:41:14,778 --> 00:41:16,137
I have just recovered today.

704
00:41:16,298 --> 00:41:17,177
I heard that Ge Bin

705
00:41:17,177 --> 00:41:18,818
was brought to the Dragon Mountain Mansion
by Dongbo Xueying.

706
00:41:18,978 --> 00:41:20,338
So I came here to check the situation.

707
00:41:26,498 --> 00:41:28,018
Greetings to you.

708
00:41:28,858 --> 00:41:29,978
You two don't need to be so formal.

709
00:41:30,378 --> 00:41:32,458
Jingqiu, why are you here, too?

710
00:41:34,018 --> 00:41:34,898
Master,

711
00:41:35,097 --> 00:41:36,737
I came to see if Ge Bin had confessed.

712
00:41:37,858 --> 00:41:39,338
Ge Bin has only been saying

713
00:41:39,498 --> 00:41:41,097
that he just followed orders
to create demons.

714
00:41:41,257 --> 00:41:41,938
He doesn't know anything

715
00:41:41,938 --> 00:41:42,858
about the Demon Clan's plan.

716
00:41:44,018 --> 00:41:44,978
Where is Ge Bin?

717
00:41:46,057 --> 00:41:47,097
Bring Ge Bin here.

718
00:41:47,257 --> 00:41:47,858
Yes.

719
00:41:57,818 --> 00:41:58,898
Spare me, please.

720
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:00,737
I'm just a small fry.

721
00:42:00,938 --> 00:42:02,498
How could
the Demon God Association tell me

722
00:42:02,498 --> 00:42:03,858
all their plans?

723
00:42:04,018 --> 00:42:05,657
The Gray Robe is a member
of the Demon God Association.

724
00:42:05,858 --> 00:42:06,778
If you capture him,

725
00:42:06,938 --> 00:42:08,898
you will definitely
be able to get more information.

726
00:42:09,137 --> 00:42:10,257
Who is the Gray Robe?

727
00:42:10,577 --> 00:42:11,657
Where is he?

728
00:42:11,858 --> 00:42:12,898
All I know is

729
00:42:13,057 --> 00:42:14,778
the Gray Robe
comes and goes without a trace.

730
00:42:14,938 --> 00:42:16,097
How about this?

731
00:42:16,257 --> 00:42:17,498
You let me go

732
00:42:17,657 --> 00:42:18,378
and I will help you

733
00:42:18,378 --> 00:42:19,458
find him.

734
00:42:19,657 --> 00:42:20,737
What a joke!

735
00:42:20,978 --> 00:42:22,617
With all the things you've done,

736
00:42:22,778 --> 00:42:24,338
you deserve
to be killed dozens of times.

737
00:42:24,498 --> 00:42:25,657
How can we let you go?

738
00:42:26,257 --> 00:42:28,217
How did you get

739
00:42:28,378 --> 00:42:29,577
the Ocean Realm Stone?

740
00:42:29,858 --> 00:42:32,737
The realm stone
was brought by the Gray Robe.

741
00:42:32,898 --> 00:42:34,057
I don't know

742
00:42:34,057 --> 00:42:35,018
how they got it.

743
00:42:35,217 --> 00:42:36,298
Do you know that

744
00:42:36,458 --> 00:42:37,898
the Ocean Realm Stone

745
00:42:38,338 --> 00:42:40,577
belongs to the Water Daoist Temple?

746
00:42:40,697 --> 00:42:41,898
All I know is

747
00:42:42,057 --> 00:42:44,177
the Ocean Realm Stone
has immense magical power.

748
00:42:44,577 --> 00:42:46,257
When creating demons,

749
00:42:46,418 --> 00:42:47,778
we don't dare to touch it.

750
00:42:48,137 --> 00:42:49,458
The Gray Robe said

751
00:42:49,697 --> 00:42:52,137
there is demonic poison
on the Ocean Realm Stone

752
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:53,898
and if we touch it,
we will be demonized.

753
00:42:55,338 --> 00:42:56,097
After they stole

754
00:42:56,097 --> 00:42:57,177
the Ocean Realm Stone,

755
00:42:57,778 --> 00:42:59,458
they demonized it.

756
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,458
