Unfortunately, you don't

25
00:02:23,355 --> 00:02:26,075
Therefore, you shall perish here today.

26
00:02:34,915 --> 00:02:35,554
Xueying.

27
00:02:35,994 --> 00:02:36,554
Maybe we can

28
00:02:36,554 --> 00:02:37,754
leave the Black Wind Cliff

29
00:02:37,834 --> 00:02:39,355

Xueying.

Xueying.

32
00:02:55,515 --> 00:02:56,795
Xueying, are you okay?

33
00:02:58,154 --> 00:02:59,034
I'm fine.

34
00:02:59,915 --> 00:03:01,675
I swear I'll get you out of here.

35
00:03:05,235 --> 00:03:07,434

A Transcendent.

55
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:13,994
(Xueying has the potential)

56
00:04:14,675 --> 00:04:16,475
(if he's still alive.)

57
00:04:17,954 --> 00:04:18,994
This time,

58
00:04:19,275 --> 00:04:21,155
I wonder whose disciple

59
00:04:21,314 --> 00:04:23,074
entered the Transcendent realm.

60
00:04:24,194 --> 00:04:25,994
If only Jingqiu was still around...

61
00:04:27,874 --> 00:04:29,434
Xueying, you broke through.

62
00:04:29,514 --> 00:04:30,754
You became a Transcendent.

63
00:04:31,634 --> 00:04:32,634
Let's go home.

64
00:04:37,994 --> 00:04:40,355
Have a taste
of the Demon Clan's top weapon,

65
00:04:40,434 --> 00:04:41,634
Soul Scouring Nail.

66
00:04:47,394 --> 00:04:48,675
Xueying, what's wrong?

67
00:04:48,795 --> 00:04:50,074
A hidden weapon struck me.

68
00:04:50,194 --> 00:04:50,915
A hidden weapon?

69
00:04:51,675 --> 00:04:52,915
Xueying, are you okay?

70
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:54,675
Xueying.

71
00:04:55,595 --> 00:04:56,434
Xueying.

72
00:04:56,915 --> 00:04:57,795
Xueying.

73
00:05:05,355 --> 00:05:07,194
T-The cloud is gone now.

74
00:05:07,275 --> 00:05:07,915
Yeah.

75
00:05:08,035 --> 00:05:09,595
The colorful cloud disappeared.

76
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:10,715
Why didn't we see

77
00:05:10,715 --> 00:05:12,355
the flame of Transcendent Dou Qi?

78
00:05:12,634 --> 00:05:14,394
Did something go wrong?

79
00:05:14,514 --> 00:05:16,394
I guess becoming a Transcendent

80
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:17,795
is not

81
00:05:17,795 --> 00:05:18,715
an easy thing.

82
00:05:19,115 --> 00:05:20,675
Only a few of the cultivators

83
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:21,715
in Dragon Mountain Empire

84
00:05:21,835 --> 00:05:22,915
can be Transcendents.

85
00:05:23,035 --> 00:05:23,754
All the rest

86
00:05:23,835 --> 00:05:25,074
may never be able to

87
00:05:25,115 --> 00:05:26,835
step into the Transcendent realm.

88
00:05:27,275 --> 00:05:28,314
You're the backup force

89
00:05:28,314 --> 00:05:29,155
against the Demon Clan.

90
00:05:29,275 --> 00:05:30,715
So you must train harder.

91
00:05:31,754 --> 00:05:32,675
Understood.

92
00:05:33,115 --> 00:05:34,035
Master, rest assured.

93
00:05:34,155 --> 00:05:35,595
We'll train harder.

94
00:05:35,954 --> 00:05:37,795
Master, I swear I will work hard

95
00:05:37,915 --> 00:05:38,915
and invent a spell seal

96
00:05:39,035 --> 00:05:40,314
that helps us become

97
00:05:40,434 --> 00:05:41,235
Transcendents.

98
00:05:41,754 --> 00:05:42,754
Go back to training.

99
00:05:46,074 --> 00:05:47,275
(I hope such a phenomenon)

100
00:05:47,434 --> 00:05:49,115
(will be caused by me next time.)

101
00:05:50,115 --> 00:05:50,715
(I must become)

102
00:05:50,835 --> 00:05:52,194
(the most powerful in the academy.)

103
00:05:52,355 --> 00:05:53,035
(No...)

104
00:05:53,235 --> 00:05:55,074
(The most powerful in this empire.)

105
00:05:55,954 --> 00:05:57,394
(I will show Master)

106
00:05:57,675 --> 00:05:58,355
(that I am the one)

107
00:05:58,475 --> 00:05:59,634
(who has the most potential,)

108
00:05:59,874 --> 00:06:01,595
(not Dongbo Xueying.)

109
00:06:03,896 --> 00:06:05,275
(Changfeng Academy)

110
00:06:05,275 --> 00:06:05,994
Master.

111
00:06:06,355 --> 00:06:07,035
Master.

112
00:06:07,155 --> 00:06:08,595
Xueying and Jingqiu are back.

113
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,954
Master, how is Xueying?

114
00:06:30,115 --> 00:06:30,634
Is he okay?

115
00:06:31,194 --> 00:06:32,554
He's badly injured.

116
00:06:32,795 --> 00:06:34,475
Thankfully, he's not going to die.

117
00:06:35,275 --> 00:06:36,514
This is incredible.

118
00:06:36,675 --> 00:06:38,394
The Black Wind Cliff is so dangerous.

119
00:06:38,754 --> 00:06:40,194
How did you come back alive?

120
00:06:40,355 --> 00:06:41,754
I thought we'd

121
00:06:41,874 --> 00:06:42,754
stay there

122
00:06:42,754 --> 00:06:43,754
forever.

123
00:06:44,155 --> 00:06:45,915
It's all because of that masked man.

124
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,994
He almost killed us.

125
00:06:48,115 --> 00:06:49,634
Xueying became a Transcendent

126
00:06:49,715 --> 00:06:50,994
when he was fighting him.

127
00:06:51,194 --> 00:06:52,595
That was how he brought me up.

128
00:06:52,675 --> 00:06:53,394
What?

129
00:06:53,675 --> 00:06:55,115
Xueying became a Transcendent?

130
00:06:55,394 --> 00:06:56,115
Yeah.

131
00:06:56,475 --> 00:06:57,915
So the signs in the sky

132
00:06:57,915 --> 00:06:58,835
were caused by him.

133
00:06:58,994 --> 00:06:59,994
But we didn't see

134
00:07:00,115 --> 00:07:01,754
the Transcendent Flame in the cloud.

135
00:07:04,554 --> 00:07:05,314
Jingqiu.

136
00:07:05,915 --> 00:07:06,595
I didn't find

137
00:07:06,595 --> 00:07:08,314
any Transcendent Dou Qi in Xueying.

138
00:07:08,915 --> 00:07:10,235
Did he really become a Transcendent?

139
00:07:10,355 --> 00:07:11,155
Yeah, I'm sure.

140
00:07:11,715 --> 00:07:13,355
I saw Xueying's granules

141
00:07:13,434 --> 00:07:14,994
changing.

142
00:07:20,754 --> 00:07:21,675
I see.

143
00:07:22,434 --> 00:07:24,194
One of those Black Armored Warriors

144
00:07:24,314 --> 00:07:25,475
shot him with

145
00:07:25,595 --> 00:07:26,675
a hidden weapon,

146
00:07:26,795 --> 00:07:27,554
which affected

147
00:07:27,554 --> 00:07:28,355
his Dou Qi.

148
00:07:28,355 --> 00:07:29,115
A hidden weapon?

149
00:07:29,915 --> 00:07:31,235
It hit him on his back.

150
00:07:39,514 --> 00:07:40,675
Is this the wound?

151
00:07:43,954 --> 00:07:45,355
I think so.

152
00:07:46,355 --> 00:07:47,874
But I can't tell

153
00:07:47,994 --> 00:07:49,194
what exactly happened.

154
00:07:49,275 --> 00:07:50,434
We have to ask Xueying

155
00:07:50,434 --> 00:07:51,355
once he wakes up.

156
00:07:59,235 --> 00:08:00,314
Let's go out first.

157
00:08:00,434 --> 00:08:01,634
Let him rest.

158
00:08:02,155 --> 00:08:02,795
Okay.

159
00:08:27,314 --> 00:08:28,795
(Dongbo Xueying beat me to it)

160
00:08:28,795 --> 00:08:29,835
(and became a Transcendent.)

161
00:08:30,314 --> 00:08:31,434
(I won't lose to him)

162
00:08:31,595 --> 00:08:32,794
(no matter what.)

163
00:08:33,075 --> 00:08:35,355
(I am the most powerful one
in Dragon Mountain Empire.)

164
00:08:54,315 --> 00:08:55,034
Senior.

165
00:09:00,794 --> 00:09:01,794
Jingqiu.

166
00:09:04,955 --> 00:09:07,075
Jingqiu, it's really you.

167
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:08,754
My little girl

168
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:10,195
really made it back

169
00:09:10,315 --> 00:09:11,555
from the Black Wind Cliff.

170
00:09:11,715 --> 00:09:12,754
That's right, Faction Leader.

171
00:09:12,874 --> 00:09:13,715
I am back.

172
00:09:13,914 --> 00:09:15,154
I missed you so much.

173
00:09:17,674 --> 00:09:18,475
Where is Xueying?

174
00:09:18,595 --> 00:09:19,835
Did he come back with you?

175
00:09:19,955 --> 00:09:20,634
Yes.

176
00:09:20,754 --> 00:09:22,514
Xueying became a Transcendent

177
00:09:22,634 --> 00:09:23,154
and managed

178
00:09:23,154 --> 00:09:24,514
to bring me up the cliff.

179
00:09:24,715 --> 00:09:25,994
But he's hurt

180
00:09:26,115 --> 00:09:27,435
and still in a coma.

181
00:09:28,475 --> 00:09:29,435
Great.

182
00:09:30,075 --> 00:09:31,914
Xueying became a Transcendent.

183
00:09:32,435 --> 00:09:33,235
I knew it.

184
00:09:33,235 --> 00:09:34,075
That kid will

185
00:09:34,154 --> 00:09:35,235
definitely achieve something.

186
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,034
Jingqiu told me

187
00:09:38,034 --> 00:09:38,914
everything.

188
00:09:39,115 --> 00:09:39,994
They found

189
00:09:39,994 --> 00:09:41,315
a mysterious Black Wind God Palace

190
00:09:41,555 --> 00:09:42,595
and a masked man

191
00:09:42,715 --> 00:09:44,195
with his Black Armored Warriors.

192
00:09:44,634 --> 00:09:45,874
Judging from her description,

193
00:09:46,555 --> 00:09:47,435
they must be related

194
00:09:47,435 --> 00:09:48,394
to the Demon Clan.

195
00:09:48,874 --> 00:09:49,914
Are you sure

196
00:09:49,994 --> 00:09:51,315
that they're related?

197
00:09:51,435 --> 00:09:52,835
I'm not sure yet.

198
00:09:53,115 --> 00:09:54,595
There was a masked man

199
00:09:54,754 --> 00:09:56,034
who never showed us

200
00:09:56,034 --> 00:09:56,634
his face.

201
00:09:56,634 --> 00:09:57,994
He also tried to control us.

202
00:09:58,115 --> 00:09:59,355
I find him extremely weird.

203
00:10:00,794 --> 00:10:02,994
I've been
in the Dragon Mountain Empire for years.

204
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:04,754
But I haven't ever heard of

205
00:10:05,355 --> 00:10:06,994
any Black Wind God Palace.

206
00:10:07,394 --> 00:10:08,674
The Demon Clan is rampant.

207
00:10:08,754 --> 00:10:10,115
They've destroyed Lu's Fort.

208
00:10:10,235 --> 00:10:10,794
Moreover,

209
00:10:11,115 --> 00:10:12,634
the disciples of Changfeng Academy

210
00:10:12,634 --> 00:10:15,274
kept disappearing.

211
00:10:16,034 --> 00:10:16,835
I think

212
00:10:16,955 --> 00:10:17,994
that place

213
00:10:18,115 --> 00:10:19,555
must be a branch of theirs.

214
00:10:20,034 --> 00:10:21,274
Since Xueying came back,

215
00:10:21,394 --> 00:10:22,595
he can take us down there.

216
00:10:22,835 --> 00:10:24,235
Inform the council.

217
00:11:09,115 --> 00:11:10,555
I can't control it.

218
00:11:11,955 --> 00:11:13,075
What's going on?

219
00:11:13,555 --> 00:11:15,475
Is my Internal Energy unsteady because

220
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:16,634
I just broke through?

221
00:11:35,435 --> 00:11:36,274
Xueying.

222
00:11:36,874 --> 00:11:38,514
Master, Elders.

223
00:11:38,674 --> 00:11:39,715
What brought you here?

224
00:11:40,514 --> 00:11:41,274
Xueying.

225
00:11:41,435 --> 00:11:43,195
You're hurt. Don't push yourself.

226
00:11:54,115 --> 00:11:54,634
I thought

227
00:11:54,754 --> 00:11:56,115
he became a Transcendent.

228
00:11:56,235 --> 00:11:56,794
Why doesn't he

229
00:11:56,914 --> 00:11:58,435
have any Transcendent Dou Qi?

230
00:11:58,555 --> 00:11:59,235
It's weird.

231
00:11:59,235 --> 00:11:59,955
When we flew up

232
00:11:59,955 --> 00:12:01,034
the Black Wind Cliff,

233
00:12:01,514 --> 00:12:02,874
my body and Dou Qi

234
00:12:02,874 --> 00:12:04,315
reached the Transcendent realm.

235
00:12:04,634 --> 00:12:06,274
Jingqiu was with me.

236
00:12:06,874 --> 00:12:07,715
But the energy

237
00:12:07,715 --> 00:12:08,794
suddenly disappeared.

238
00:12:08,914 --> 00:12:10,075
I don't know why.

239
00:12:10,514 --> 00:12:12,475
You were hit
by a hidden weapon on the cliff.

240
00:12:12,674 --> 00:12:13,754
I guess it suppressed

241
00:12:13,835 --> 00:12:15,274
the Transcendent Dou Qi.

242
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:16,435
I've checked

243
00:12:16,435 --> 00:12:17,595
his wound.

244
00:12:17,754 --> 00:12:19,274
The hidden weapon was too ordinary

245
00:12:19,435 --> 00:12:20,874
to have done so much harm.

246
00:12:20,994 --> 00:12:21,715
But you did

247
00:12:21,715 --> 00:12:23,075
gain much Internal Energy.

248
00:12:23,195 --> 00:12:24,435
There is an easy way

249
00:12:24,555 --> 00:12:25,475
to find out.

250
00:12:25,634 --> 00:12:27,154
We can fight each other to see

251
00:12:27,274 --> 00:12:28,914
if you have become a Transcendent.

252
00:12:29,034 --> 00:12:30,235
Xueying is still hurt.

253
00:12:30,235 --> 00:12:31,235
You shouldn't fight.

254
00:12:31,355 --> 00:12:32,355
Rest assured.

255
00:12:32,475 --> 00:12:33,634
It will be

256
00:12:33,634 --> 00:12:34,475
a mild contest

257
00:12:34,674 --> 00:12:35,514
only with Dou Qi.

258
00:12:35,595 --> 00:12:36,195
No.

259
00:12:36,394 --> 00:12:38,115
You're obsessed with fighting.

260
00:12:38,235 --> 00:12:39,154
You're fine.

261
00:12:39,195 --> 00:12:40,315
But Xueying is badly hurt.

262
00:12:40,674 --> 00:12:41,674
You feel for him.

263
00:12:43,994 --> 00:12:44,595
Jingqiu.

264
00:12:47,874 --> 00:12:49,154
I can hurt myself first

265
00:12:49,274 --> 00:12:50,115
and challenge him

266
00:12:50,315 --> 00:12:51,115
just to be fair.

267
00:12:51,435 --> 00:12:52,235
Situ Hong.

268
00:13:06,034 --> 00:13:07,274
Thank you, Master Sikong.

269
00:13:07,475 --> 00:13:08,914
You're still very weak.

270
00:13:09,034 --> 00:13:10,274
You need rest.

271
00:13:10,674 --> 00:13:11,715
Jingqiu

272
00:13:11,835 --> 00:13:12,355
has told us

273
00:13:12,475 --> 00:13:13,674
everything that happened

274
00:13:13,794 --> 00:13:14,754
under the cliff.

275
00:13:15,435 --> 00:13:16,914
I believe the Black Wind God Palace

276
00:13:17,034 --> 00:13:18,235
is tied to the Demon Clan.

277
00:13:18,394 --> 00:13:20,034
Once you recover,

278
00:13:20,195 --> 00:13:21,274
take us there

279
00:13:21,435 --> 00:13:22,274
to investigate.

280
00:13:22,394 --> 00:13:23,154
If it is truly

281
00:13:23,315 --> 00:13:24,394
tied to the Demon Clan,

282
00:13:24,514 --> 00:13:25,754
then there's no time to lose.

283
00:13:25,914 --> 00:13:26,754
Why don't we...

284
00:13:26,835 --> 00:13:28,034
I know it's urgent,

285
00:13:28,154 --> 00:13:28,994
but you have to

286
00:13:28,994 --> 00:13:29,874
recover first.

287
00:13:29,994 --> 00:13:31,315
You can't lead us

288
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:32,715
down the cliff like this.

289
00:13:32,835 --> 00:13:33,874
Jingqiu is right.

290
00:13:34,075 --> 00:13:35,355
Get better first.

291
00:13:35,555 --> 00:13:36,674
You just broke through.

292
00:13:36,794 --> 00:13:38,634
Your body and Dou Qi have changed.

293
00:13:38,794 --> 00:13:40,475
You may not be showing any signs

294
00:13:40,595 --> 00:13:41,154
because

295
00:13:41,154 --> 00:13:42,315
you're too weak now.

296
00:13:42,435 --> 00:13:44,034
Let's wait for you to recover.

297
00:13:45,034 --> 00:13:45,754
Understood.

298
00:14:29,674 --> 00:14:30,435
Xueying.

299
00:14:34,634 --> 00:14:35,674
You haven't recovered

300
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:36,595
but you're restless.

301
00:14:36,794 --> 00:14:38,394
I want to try my Dou Qi.

302
00:14:38,874 --> 00:14:40,794
This burning sensation is awful.

303
00:14:41,034 --> 00:14:42,715
I know you can't wait to try

304
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:43,394
the power

305
00:14:43,514 --> 00:14:44,754
of the Transcendent realm.

306
00:14:45,235 --> 00:14:46,994
But you can't rush it.

307
00:14:47,794 --> 00:14:48,634
My sister is not here.

308
00:14:48,754 --> 00:14:49,874
I must watch you for her.

309
00:14:50,435 --> 00:14:51,955
She'll be thrilled if she knows

310
00:14:52,115 --> 00:14:53,555
that you're still alive.

311
00:14:58,315 --> 00:14:59,634
I don't see Puyang Bo here.

312
00:14:59,754 --> 00:15:01,235
Did he go out with Youyue?

313
00:15:01,355 --> 00:15:02,634
Something happened at home.

314
00:15:02,835 --> 00:15:04,274
They're gone for now

315
00:15:04,514 --> 00:15:05,634
but they'll be back soon.

316
00:15:09,154 --> 00:15:10,115
Dongbo Xueying.

317
00:15:13,034 --> 00:15:14,355
You're up so late,

318
00:15:14,674 --> 00:15:16,195
trying to be a Transcendent?

319
00:15:16,634 --> 00:15:17,674
Didn't Master Tai Shu

320
00:15:17,674 --> 00:15:18,555
say that

321
00:15:18,674 --> 00:15:19,595
you don't have

322
00:15:19,715 --> 00:15:21,394
any Transcendent Dou Qi within you?

323
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:22,514
Maybe

324
00:15:23,235 --> 00:15:24,555
you were mistaken.

325
00:15:24,674 --> 00:15:25,274
No way.

326
00:15:25,914 --> 00:15:27,555
When I flew up the Black Wind Cliff,

327
00:15:27,674 --> 00:15:28,914
I knew my Dou Qi

328
00:15:28,914 --> 00:15:30,355
reached the Transcendent realm.

329
00:15:30,715 --> 00:15:31,514
However,

330
00:15:31,634 --> 00:15:32,355
I don't know why

331
00:15:32,355 --> 00:15:33,794
the energy suddenly disappeared.

332
00:15:34,315 --> 00:15:35,115
I think

333
00:15:35,555 --> 00:15:37,115
maybe it requires some practice.

334
00:15:38,355 --> 00:15:39,274
Some practice?

335
00:15:39,914 --> 00:15:41,274
The Transcendent realm

336
00:15:41,514 --> 00:15:42,754
is not something you reach

337
00:15:42,874 --> 00:15:43,754
through practice.

338
00:15:45,034 --> 00:15:46,514
If you don't feel convinced,

339
00:15:46,754 --> 00:15:48,674
the Transcendent Trial is in two weeks.

340
00:15:48,835 --> 00:15:49,595
You will

341
00:15:50,514 --> 00:15:51,634
find out the truth.

342
00:15:51,955 --> 00:15:52,835
Situ Hong.

343
00:15:53,274 --> 00:15:54,715
Xueying just escaped from death.

344
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:55,874
He's still hurt.

345
00:15:56,115 --> 00:15:56,874
Why are you

346
00:15:56,874 --> 00:15:57,595
inciting him

347
00:15:57,754 --> 00:15:58,674
to attend the trial?

348
00:15:59,315 --> 00:16:00,034
I'll go.

349
00:16:01,914 --> 00:16:02,715
Xueying.

350
00:16:02,874 --> 00:16:04,235
Don't be impulsive.

351
00:16:04,634 --> 00:16:05,634
Don't fall for

352
00:16:05,634 --> 00:16:06,315
his trick.

353
00:16:06,794 --> 00:16:07,955
I have two weeks.

354
00:16:08,154 --> 00:16:08,874
It's enough.

355
00:16:09,154 --> 00:16:09,914
To recover

356
00:16:09,914 --> 00:16:11,315
and achieve breakthroughs

357
00:16:11,315 --> 00:16:11,994
in a short time

358
00:16:11,994 --> 00:16:12,794
and tough environment

359
00:16:13,195 --> 00:16:13,994
is a lesson

360
00:16:13,994 --> 00:16:15,154
for all cultivators.

361
00:16:17,154 --> 00:16:18,195
In that case,

362
00:16:19,874 --> 00:16:21,154
see you there.

363
00:16:29,754 --> 00:16:30,555
Thank you.

364
00:16:34,075 --> 00:16:35,394
Come on in.

365
00:16:38,315 --> 00:16:39,075
Moyang's Fort

366
00:16:39,075 --> 00:16:40,034
is so busy today.

367
00:16:40,355 --> 00:16:40,955
Look at them.

368
00:16:41,115 --> 00:16:42,394
The things they carry

369
00:16:42,555 --> 00:16:43,874
say "Longevity".

370
00:16:43,994 --> 00:16:45,195
Only Moyang Chen

371
00:16:45,315 --> 00:16:46,355
can hold such a grand

372
00:16:46,475 --> 00:16:47,634
birthday party

373
00:16:47,754 --> 00:16:49,075
at Moyang's Fort.

374
00:16:49,595 --> 00:16:50,634
Perfect.

375
00:16:50,754 --> 00:16:51,794
The fort must be

376
00:16:51,794 --> 00:16:52,555
full of people.

377
00:16:52,715 --> 00:16:53,835
We can sneak in.

378
00:16:54,955 --> 00:16:56,595
But you see,

379
00:16:56,715 --> 00:16:58,394
those guests have invitations.

380
00:16:58,555 --> 00:17:00,315
I don't think we can sneak in.

381
00:17:00,475 --> 00:17:02,034
Besides, I checked around

382
00:17:02,154 --> 00:17:03,475
when we were coming.

383
00:17:03,595 --> 00:17:05,154
There are barriers all around.

384
00:17:05,474 --> 00:17:06,634
It may not be a good idea

385
00:17:06,755 --> 00:17:07,874
to sneak in.

386
00:17:09,115 --> 00:17:10,275
So what do we do?

387
00:17:15,474 --> 00:17:16,275
I have an idea.

388
00:17:22,835 --> 00:17:25,194
Today is Fort Master Moyang's birthday.

389
00:17:25,315 --> 00:17:26,355
I especially

390
00:17:26,515 --> 00:17:27,634
prepared

391
00:17:27,795 --> 00:17:29,674
a unique present for you.

392
00:17:29,835 --> 00:17:31,355
I'll show it

393
00:17:31,515 --> 00:17:32,755
on this battleground.

394
00:17:33,194 --> 00:17:34,515
I hope you could accept it.

395
00:18:30,634 --> 00:18:32,634
Bravo!

396
00:18:35,115 --> 00:18:37,154
Bravo!

397
00:18:37,555 --> 00:18:38,595
(Surprising, huh?)

398
00:18:38,874 --> 00:18:40,154
(I adapted it)

399
00:18:40,315 --> 00:18:42,154
(from Visionary Gaze.)

400
00:18:42,315 --> 00:18:43,874
(No one else in Dragon Mountain Empire)

401
00:18:44,275 --> 00:18:45,634
(can possibly do this.)

402
00:18:49,474 --> 00:18:50,234
Bravo!

403
00:19:17,714 --> 00:19:20,075
Your Lordship, I wish you prosperity

404
00:19:20,234 --> 00:19:21,394
and longevity.

405
00:19:28,515 --> 00:19:30,075
Youyue, that was amazing.

406
00:19:30,234 --> 00:19:30,674
Let's go.

407
00:19:31,394 --> 00:19:32,835
What a wonderful dance.

408
00:19:33,234 --> 00:19:34,315
So well prepared.

409
00:19:36,755 --> 00:19:38,075
(Call me.)

410
00:19:38,474 --> 00:19:40,315
(Are you really going to let me leave?)

411
00:19:41,714 --> 00:19:42,954
Miss, wait a minute.

412
00:19:47,755 --> 00:19:49,474
Lord Moyang has invited both of you

413
00:19:49,634 --> 00:19:50,555
to dinner.

414
00:20:00,954 --> 00:20:03,194
May I ask where you are from?

415
00:20:03,434 --> 00:20:05,394
We're from the Kong's Weapon Workshop.

416
00:20:05,595 --> 00:20:07,515
Kong's Weapon Workshop?

417
00:20:09,315 --> 00:20:10,154
I don't think

418
00:20:10,154 --> 00:20:11,714
I've sent you invitations.

419
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:12,795
That's why we came

420
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,115
to your birthday party

421
00:20:14,275 --> 00:20:15,555
uninvited.

422
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:17,275
Honestly,

423
00:20:17,515 --> 00:20:18,515
it's all because

424
00:20:18,674 --> 00:20:19,714
my father wouldn't let me

425
00:20:19,835 --> 00:20:21,275
do business because I'm a girl.

426
00:20:21,434 --> 00:20:23,234
Otherwise, I wouldn't have

427
00:20:23,355 --> 00:20:24,275
come all the way

428
00:20:24,394 --> 00:20:25,835
to talk business with you.

429
00:20:26,595 --> 00:20:28,555
I'm not sure I'm following.

430
00:20:28,714 --> 00:20:29,555
Here's the thing.

431
00:20:29,755 --> 00:20:30,515
I bought

432
00:20:30,515 --> 00:20:32,154
some Bloodthirst Blades these days.

433
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,434
I'd like to know

434
00:20:33,434 --> 00:20:34,714
what you think.

435
00:20:35,515 --> 00:20:36,515
This business

436
00:20:36,634 --> 00:20:38,234
means a lot to me.

437
00:20:38,634 --> 00:20:40,595
If I manage to work with you,

438
00:20:40,755 --> 00:20:41,555
my father may

439
00:20:41,595 --> 00:20:43,315
allow me to be a businesswoman.

440
00:20:45,555 --> 00:20:47,234
Then, I have to check

441
00:20:47,394 --> 00:20:49,194
on your Bloodthirst Blades first.

442
00:20:49,954 --> 00:20:50,874
Of course.

443
00:20:51,075 --> 00:20:51,914
Since you're

444
00:20:52,035 --> 00:20:53,035
interested,

445
00:20:53,234 --> 00:20:53,995
I'll have

446
00:20:54,115 --> 00:20:55,035
the blades sent here

447
00:20:55,035 --> 00:20:55,954
tomorrow.

448
00:20:56,595 --> 00:20:57,714
You have no idea.

449
00:20:57,914 --> 00:20:58,995
Ever since the Demon Clan

450
00:20:59,115 --> 00:20:59,954
invaded the Sea God Palace

451
00:21:00,115 --> 00:21:01,555
with Bloodshed Weapons,

452
00:21:01,755 --> 00:21:02,714
Bloodthirst Blades

453
00:21:02,874 --> 00:21:04,394
have been hard to sell.

454
00:21:04,995 --> 00:21:06,275
Everyone knows that

455
00:21:06,555 --> 00:21:07,595
the Bloodthirst Blade

456
00:21:07,714 --> 00:21:09,555
is the key material for making

457
00:21:09,674 --> 00:21:10,755
Bloodshed Weapons.

458
00:21:11,035 --> 00:21:12,434
At this point,

459
00:21:12,634 --> 00:21:14,355
people are especially terrified

460
00:21:14,595 --> 00:21:17,714
to be tied to the Demon Clan.

461
00:21:22,355 --> 00:21:23,234
But

462
00:21:23,394 --> 00:21:24,954
no matter what others think,

463
00:21:25,115 --> 00:21:26,434
I'm sure you have nothing

464
00:21:26,434 --> 00:21:27,434
to do with it.

465
00:21:27,595 --> 00:21:28,634
Your Lordship,

466
00:21:28,634 --> 00:21:30,555
I know you're focused on cultivation

467
00:21:30,874 --> 00:21:32,315
and never meddle with others.

468
00:21:33,035 --> 00:21:35,515
Maybe you haven't even heard

469
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:38,515
about the invasion of the Demon Clan

470
00:21:38,995 --> 00:21:40,355
into the Sea God Palace.

471
00:21:41,394 --> 00:21:42,634
I've heard a little about it.

472
00:21:45,234 --> 00:21:47,914
I heard that the court is investigating

473
00:21:48,035 --> 00:21:49,914
all the alchemy workshops in the empire.

474
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:51,194
No matter what,

475
00:21:51,275 --> 00:21:52,194
I'm sure you have

476
00:21:52,315 --> 00:21:53,634
nothing to do with it.

477
00:21:54,035 --> 00:21:55,474
As far as I know,

478
00:21:55,634 --> 00:21:57,115
you've never

479
00:21:57,115 --> 00:21:58,755
dealt with alchemy.

480
00:21:59,714 --> 00:22:01,995
The alchemy workshop at Dongxiang Lake

481
00:22:02,674 --> 00:22:04,234
belongs to Moyang's Fort.

482
00:22:05,634 --> 00:22:06,275
Come on.

483
00:22:06,995 --> 00:22:07,914
Let's talk over dinner.

484
00:22:22,755 --> 00:22:23,115
Youyue.

485
00:22:23,115 --> 00:22:24,154
You were so charismatic.

486
00:22:24,234 --> 00:22:25,315
I was scared to death.

487
00:22:25,474 --> 00:22:26,835
Don't mention it.

488
00:22:27,755 --> 00:22:28,595
But

489
00:22:28,714 --> 00:22:29,515
Moyang Chen

490
00:22:29,515 --> 00:22:30,515
has his own

491
00:22:30,515 --> 00:22:31,474
alchemy workshop.

492
00:22:31,634 --> 00:22:32,914
Why would he buy

493
00:22:32,914 --> 00:22:34,595
Bloodshed Weapons from us?

494
00:22:35,555 --> 00:22:36,515
Who knows?

495
00:22:36,555 --> 00:22:37,755
We'll go and find out.

496
00:22:38,035 --> 00:22:39,154
But we're

497
00:22:39,154 --> 00:22:40,234
over 100 miles away

498
00:22:40,234 --> 00:22:41,434
from Dongxiang Lake.

499
00:22:42,154 --> 00:22:43,315
I have mastered

500
00:22:43,315 --> 00:22:44,315
the Shadow Steps.

501
00:22:44,355 --> 00:22:45,115
It's nothing.

502
00:22:45,115 --> 00:22:46,154
I can carry you.

503
00:22:47,154 --> 00:22:47,595
Let's go.

504
00:22:47,595 --> 00:22:48,194
Let's go.

505
00:23:02,555 --> 00:23:03,474
What brought you here?

506
00:23:03,634 --> 00:23:05,115
I knew you couldn't stay put

507
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:06,954
and would come out to practice.

508
00:23:10,234 --> 00:23:11,194
You're sweating.

509
00:23:15,275 --> 00:23:16,154
So delicate.

510
00:23:16,954 --> 00:23:18,154
What a chubby bird.

511
00:23:19,874 --> 00:23:21,035
Are you serious?

512
00:23:21,234 --> 00:23:22,795
It's an eagle!

513
00:23:22,954 --> 00:23:23,954
It's an eagle?

514
00:23:23,954 --> 00:23:25,515
Take a closer look.

515
00:23:26,154 --> 00:23:27,434
It's obviously a chubby bird.

516
00:23:27,755 --> 00:23:28,595
You!

517
00:23:29,515 --> 00:23:30,315
- Stop.
- Chubby bird.

518
00:23:32,355 --> 00:23:33,234
It's a chubby bird.

519
00:23:33,394 --> 00:23:34,474
Xueying.

520
00:23:36,075 --> 00:23:37,234
- Come and get me.
- Don't run.

521
00:24:06,394 --> 00:24:07,154
Master.

522
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,035
Xueying.

523
00:24:08,154 --> 00:24:08,874
Why did you come?

524
00:24:09,434 --> 00:24:10,874
How are you feeling?

525
00:24:11,035 --> 00:24:11,674
Much better.

526
00:24:11,714 --> 00:24:12,914
Master, I'd like to guide you

527
00:24:12,914 --> 00:24:13,914
to the cliff soon.

528
00:24:13,914 --> 00:24:14,555
Okay.

529
00:24:14,914 --> 00:24:16,275
I'll inform the Elders.

530
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:22,456
(Black Wind Cliff)

531
00:24:26,674 --> 00:24:27,595
It's here.

532
00:24:31,595 --> 00:24:32,634
Look around.

533
00:25:06,035 --> 00:25:06,835
Hong.

534
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:08,154
Tie it up for me.

535
00:25:08,154 --> 00:25:09,555
I can't tie it anyhow.

536
00:25:12,874 --> 00:25:13,595
You do it.

537
00:25:19,714 --> 00:25:20,355
Done.

538
00:25:29,154 --> 00:25:30,075
Come here.

539
00:25:31,394 --> 00:25:32,355
Why is Si Borong's

540
00:25:32,355 --> 00:25:33,234
jade pendant here?

541
00:25:33,555 --> 00:25:34,835
Si Borong?

542
00:25:35,954 --> 00:25:36,555
That night,

543
00:25:36,555 --> 00:25:37,474
a Black Armored Warrior

544
00:25:37,474 --> 00:25:38,154
did barge in

545
00:25:38,434 --> 00:25:39,755
as if trying to say something.

546
00:25:39,995 --> 00:25:41,194
But I couldn't tell

547
00:25:41,194 --> 00:25:42,115
that he was Si Borong.

548
00:25:43,355 --> 00:25:44,355
Why didn't you tell us

549
00:25:44,355 --> 00:25:45,634
this important clue earlier?

550
00:25:46,355 --> 00:25:47,315
You had the chance.

551
00:25:47,315 --> 00:25:48,315
Why didn't you save him?

552
00:25:48,355 --> 00:25:49,595
It was urgent.

553
00:25:49,755 --> 00:25:50,914
The masked man took him

554
00:25:51,035 --> 00:25:52,434
before I could react.

555
00:25:52,474 --> 00:25:54,434
If you had told us about this earlier,

556
00:25:54,674 --> 00:25:56,434
we would have arrived here earlier,

557
00:25:56,755 --> 00:25:58,595
and Si Borong would be fine.

558
00:25:58,954 --> 00:25:59,995
Listen.

559
00:26:00,275 --> 00:26:02,115
If anything happens to him,

560
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:05,954
I won't let it go easily.

561
00:26:06,394 --> 00:26:07,835
Situ Hong, calm down.

562
00:26:08,154 --> 00:26:09,075
Xueying and I

563
00:26:09,075 --> 00:26:09,795
were locked up

564
00:26:09,795 --> 00:26:10,995
and in deep trouble.

565
00:26:11,194 --> 00:26:12,115
If we knew that

566
00:26:12,115 --> 00:26:13,035
Si Borong was here,

567
00:26:13,035 --> 00:26:14,394
we'd have saved him at all costs.

568
00:26:14,394 --> 00:26:15,194
Don't get us wrong.

569
00:26:15,194 --> 00:26:15,835
Save it.

570
00:26:15,835 --> 00:26:17,035
It's too late.

571
00:26:17,474 --> 00:26:19,234
We don't even know if he's alive.

572
00:26:19,874 --> 00:26:20,515
He doesn't have

573
00:26:20,515 --> 00:26:21,595
much time left.

574
00:26:22,634 --> 00:26:23,474
Situ Hong.

575
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:24,954
Calm down.

576
00:26:25,515 --> 00:26:26,115
We will

577
00:26:26,115 --> 00:26:27,315
get to the bottom of it.

578
00:26:31,154 --> 00:26:32,515
The Black Armored Warriors

579
00:26:32,714 --> 00:26:33,755
seem to be

580
00:26:33,755 --> 00:26:34,755
our missing disciples.

581
00:26:37,474 --> 00:26:38,674
So, the Demon Clan

582
00:26:38,874 --> 00:26:40,394
suffered huge losses.

583
00:26:41,075 --> 00:26:42,515
They snatched our disciples

584
00:26:42,515 --> 00:26:45,194
to make them Black Armored Warriors.

585
00:26:45,394 --> 00:26:46,234
The Demon Clan

586
00:26:46,234 --> 00:26:48,035
is definitely after the Demon Well.

587
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:49,394
They've obtained

588
00:26:49,394 --> 00:26:50,474
the rare source stone.

589
00:26:50,835 --> 00:26:51,795
Now,

590
00:26:51,954 --> 00:26:53,874
they have made Black Armored Warriors.

591
00:26:54,394 --> 00:26:55,154
I guess

592
00:26:55,355 --> 00:26:56,555
we should strengthen

593
00:26:56,555 --> 00:26:57,835
the armed forces in Nanqin.

594
00:26:59,555 --> 00:27:00,995
Unfortunately,

595
00:27:00,995 --> 00:27:02,154
they ran away too fast.

596
00:27:02,515 --> 00:27:03,595
Otherwise, I swear

597
00:27:03,595 --> 00:27:04,634
I'd tear them apart.

598
00:27:04,995 --> 00:27:06,315
Being mad doesn't do anything.

599
00:27:06,555 --> 00:27:07,835
The Demon God Association

600
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:08,634
is hard to track.

601
00:27:08,795 --> 00:27:09,555
We should

602
00:27:09,555 --> 00:27:10,194
look around

603
00:27:10,194 --> 00:27:10,634
and search

604
00:27:10,634 --> 00:27:11,714
for other clues.

605
00:27:18,714 --> 00:27:19,275
This is the way

606
00:27:19,275 --> 00:27:20,275
up and down the cliff.

607
00:27:28,315 --> 00:27:29,234
Come here.

608
00:27:33,394 --> 00:27:34,394
We've gone up

609
00:27:34,394 --> 00:27:35,115
and come down

610
00:27:35,115 --> 00:27:36,234
from this passageway.

611
00:27:36,474 --> 00:27:37,595
But we actually overlooked

612
00:27:37,634 --> 00:27:39,315
this extraordinary crack.

613
00:27:40,355 --> 00:27:41,194
This crack

614
00:27:41,194 --> 00:27:42,595
was left by a human, right?

615
00:27:42,795 --> 00:27:43,355
Who would

616
00:27:43,434 --> 00:27:44,755
have such Internal Energy?

617
00:27:45,154 --> 00:27:45,995
Very few people

618
00:27:46,035 --> 00:27:47,714
in Dragon Mountain Empire can do this.

619
00:27:47,914 --> 00:27:49,515
It's an essential clue.

620
00:27:49,835 --> 00:27:51,355
If you find this person,

621
00:27:51,755 --> 00:27:53,194
we may find the Demon Clan.

622
00:27:53,674 --> 00:27:55,835
Let's consult
the Dragon Mountain Mansion.

623
00:27:56,474 --> 00:27:58,075
They know everything.

624
00:27:58,234 --> 00:27:59,394
Maybe they have an answer.

625
00:27:59,674 --> 00:28:00,355
Let's go.

626
00:28:04,440 --> 00:28:06,424
(Alchemy Workshop)

627
00:28:10,995 --> 00:28:12,555
That's right. It's here.

628
00:28:16,714 --> 00:28:17,355
Sir.

629
00:28:17,355 --> 00:28:17,954
Greetings.

630
00:28:18,835 --> 00:28:20,515
We'd like some alchemy inner armors.

631
00:28:20,515 --> 00:28:21,835
Yeah, and some alchemy boots.

632
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:23,075
It's the wrong place.

633
00:28:23,075 --> 00:28:24,674
We only make things here.

634
00:28:24,795 --> 00:28:25,835
Exactly, we want

635
00:28:25,835 --> 00:28:26,755
our things customized.

636
00:28:26,874 --> 00:28:28,115
It's a bad time.

637
00:28:28,115 --> 00:28:30,075
Look, we're already overwhelmed.

638
00:28:30,194 --> 00:28:30,954
Please,

639
00:28:31,115 --> 00:28:32,035
go home.

640
00:28:33,075 --> 00:28:34,434
You have so many handicraftsmen.

641
00:28:34,595 --> 00:28:35,835
Why are you overwhelmed?

642
00:28:36,075 --> 00:28:37,795
We just got a job...

643
00:28:40,474 --> 00:28:42,035
Let's stop bothering them.

644
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:43,194
They said they were

645
00:28:43,194 --> 00:28:44,595
too busy for us.

646
00:28:44,714 --> 00:28:45,914
What do we do?

647
00:28:48,434 --> 00:28:49,835
Let's do it ourselves.

648
00:28:49,995 --> 00:28:51,315
If I learn the technique,

649
00:28:51,355 --> 00:28:52,474
I can make them for you.

650
00:28:52,555 --> 00:28:53,995
There are stoves and fires.

651
00:28:54,154 --> 00:28:55,315
It looks just like cooking.

652
00:28:55,474 --> 00:28:56,035
I am known

653
00:28:56,035 --> 00:28:58,275
as the "Three Day" chef.

654
00:28:58,714 --> 00:28:59,674
What does it mean?

655
00:28:59,874 --> 00:29:01,035
Everyone ponders over

656
00:29:01,035 --> 00:29:02,355
my dishes for three days.

657
00:29:02,555 --> 00:29:04,075
It's more likely they have diarrhea

658
00:29:04,075 --> 00:29:04,835
for three days.

659
00:29:05,154 --> 00:29:06,035
Kiddo,

660
00:29:06,474 --> 00:29:08,154
this is not like cooking.

661
00:29:08,595 --> 00:29:10,515
There is much more to it.

662
00:29:10,714 --> 00:29:12,275
You won't learn the basics

663
00:29:12,434 --> 00:29:13,795
in just a year or so.

664
00:29:14,674 --> 00:29:15,555
My nickname

665
00:29:15,555 --> 00:29:16,795
bears another meaning.

666
00:29:16,995 --> 00:29:17,914
I can learn anything

667
00:29:17,914 --> 00:29:18,835
in three days.

668
00:29:19,115 --> 00:29:20,515
I don't have time for chitchats.

669
00:29:20,555 --> 00:29:21,275
I have to work.

670
00:29:21,355 --> 00:29:22,234
Please go back.

671
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,194
What brought you Elders

672
00:29:39,315 --> 00:29:40,315
here?

673
00:29:40,515 --> 00:29:41,355
Lord Si An.

674
00:29:41,595 --> 00:29:42,474
We're here today

675
00:29:42,555 --> 00:29:44,194
to ask you for a favor.

676
00:29:52,954 --> 00:29:54,075
This crack

677
00:29:54,714 --> 00:29:56,115
was torn by the Internal Energy

678
00:29:56,115 --> 00:29:56,835
of a cultivator?

679
00:29:57,595 --> 00:29:58,434
Exactly.

680
00:29:58,674 --> 00:29:59,755
We're here

681
00:29:59,995 --> 00:30:01,755
to ask you to help investigate

682
00:30:01,995 --> 00:30:02,874
who has such

683
00:30:02,954 --> 00:30:03,555
Internal Energy

684
00:30:03,555 --> 00:30:04,795
in Dragon Mountain Empire.

685
00:30:05,115 --> 00:30:06,075
It may be related

686
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:07,634
to the Demon Clan.

687
00:30:16,954 --> 00:30:18,035
Throughout time,

688
00:30:18,315 --> 00:30:19,555
apart from Demigods,

689
00:30:19,835 --> 00:30:20,595
only five people

690
00:30:20,595 --> 00:30:21,515
have

691
00:30:21,555 --> 00:30:22,394
such Internal Energy.

692
00:30:22,874 --> 00:30:25,075
Moyang Yu, Si Lianghong,

693
00:30:25,355 --> 00:30:27,434
Xiang Pangyun, Mr. Shan,

694
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:29,234
and the former Master of Moyang's Fort.

695
00:30:29,555 --> 00:30:30,234
Three of them

696
00:30:30,234 --> 00:30:31,315
have passed away.

697
00:30:31,515 --> 00:30:33,115
Only Moyang Yu and Si Lianghong

698
00:30:33,115 --> 00:30:33,874
are alive.

699
00:30:34,835 --> 00:30:35,954
And as far as I know,

700
00:30:36,194 --> 00:30:37,914
Moyang Yu has been kept
at Leichao Sea Cliff

701
00:30:38,154 --> 00:30:39,315
for ten years

702
00:30:39,595 --> 00:30:41,394
due to family issues until today.

703
00:30:41,674 --> 00:30:42,714
And Si Lianghong

704
00:30:42,755 --> 00:30:44,035
suffered deterioration

705
00:30:44,115 --> 00:30:44,755
in cultivation

706
00:30:44,755 --> 00:30:46,315
after the Demon Clan

707
00:30:46,474 --> 00:30:47,515
broke the Demon Well

708
00:30:47,835 --> 00:30:49,154
in Nanqin City.

709
00:30:49,515 --> 00:30:50,115
She can't

710
00:30:50,115 --> 00:30:51,634
have such Internal Energy.

711
00:30:56,075 --> 00:30:56,914
So,

712
00:30:57,115 --> 00:30:58,355
no one has such powerful

713
00:30:58,595 --> 00:30:59,434
Internal Energy

714
00:30:59,434 --> 00:31:00,755
in the entire empire.

715
00:31:03,674 --> 00:31:04,555
Maybe

716
00:31:05,714 --> 00:31:06,795
there's someone else.

717
00:31:07,515 --> 00:31:08,315
Who is it?

718
00:31:10,634 --> 00:31:11,634
Bai Yuanzhi.

719
00:31:14,515 --> 00:31:15,595
Bai Yuanzhi?

720
00:31:16,115 --> 00:31:17,315
I don't think

721
00:31:17,434 --> 00:31:18,595
I've heard of him.

722
00:31:19,234 --> 00:31:20,394
Bai Yuanzhi

723
00:31:20,555 --> 00:31:22,234
is a mage in Yishui City.

724
00:31:22,595 --> 00:31:24,755
He may seem ordinary.

725
00:31:24,954 --> 00:31:26,474
But I suspect that he's hiding

726
00:31:26,474 --> 00:31:27,874
his profound Internal Energy.

727
00:31:28,275 --> 00:31:29,555
This man leads a mysterious

728
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:30,595
and elusive life.

729
00:31:31,035 --> 00:31:31,714
You may

730
00:31:32,075 --> 00:31:33,795
look into his background.

731
00:31:33,795 --> 00:31:35,595
Since he looks ordinary,

732
00:31:35,795 --> 00:31:36,914
how do you know that he has

733
00:31:36,914 --> 00:31:38,154
powerful Internal Energy?

734
00:31:38,275 --> 00:31:39,075
It traces back

735
00:31:39,355 --> 00:31:41,115
to over 20 years ago

736
00:31:41,355 --> 00:31:42,714
when the war just ended

737
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:44,434
between the Xia Clan and the Demon Clan.

738
00:31:44,434 --> 00:31:46,234
(The Demon Clan just lost.)

739
00:31:46,434 --> 00:31:48,075
(Those who remained in the empire)

740
00:31:48,194 --> 00:31:49,474
(were rampant.)

741
00:31:56,075 --> 00:31:57,634
The Demon Clan has lost.

742
00:31:57,835 --> 00:31:59,795
How can we let them stay rampant?

743
00:32:00,874 --> 00:32:01,835
You are...?

744
00:32:02,115 --> 00:32:03,394
I am Bai Yuanzhi.

745
00:32:04,995 --> 00:32:06,035
May I ask

746
00:32:06,275 --> 00:32:07,275
why you're here?

747
00:32:07,515 --> 00:32:08,634
I'd like to know

748
00:32:08,995 --> 00:32:09,914
the names

749
00:32:09,914 --> 00:32:11,355
of the top cultivators

750
00:32:11,355 --> 00:32:12,394
in Yishui City.

751
00:32:12,874 --> 00:32:14,634
Why are you looking

752
00:32:14,634 --> 00:32:15,434
for them?

753
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:18,275
Well,

754
00:32:18,674 --> 00:32:20,194
what's the fun of cultivating alone?

755
00:32:20,434 --> 00:32:22,434
We need to constantly

756
00:32:23,275 --> 00:32:24,755
challenge others.

757
00:32:38,115 --> 00:32:39,154
Here are the names.

758
00:32:40,203 --> 00:32:43,097
(Moyang Yu, Si Lianghong, Sikong Yang
Xing Pangyun, Mr. Shan)

759
00:32:47,954 --> 00:32:48,795
Thank you.

760
00:33:00,315 --> 00:33:01,634
Ice Technique.

761
00:33:03,874 --> 00:33:04,755
Later,

762
00:33:05,194 --> 00:33:06,755
I paid extra attention to him

763
00:33:06,755 --> 00:33:07,595
for quite a while.

764
00:33:08,115 --> 00:33:09,954
He said he'd challenge them,

765
00:33:10,115 --> 00:33:11,194
but he simply

766
00:33:11,194 --> 00:33:12,755
stayed close to them.

767
00:33:13,115 --> 00:33:15,035
He even settled down in Yishui City.

768
00:33:15,275 --> 00:33:16,555
I've never seen him displaying

769
00:33:16,595 --> 00:33:17,474
his true power.

770
00:33:17,874 --> 00:33:19,275
But my intuition tells me

771
00:33:19,714 --> 00:33:21,115
that he's not ordinary.

772
00:33:21,755 --> 00:33:22,714
It seems that

773
00:33:22,914 --> 00:33:24,115
we should

774
00:33:24,275 --> 00:33:26,835
meet this Bai Yuanzhi.

775
00:33:27,154 --> 00:33:28,714
If he works for the Demon Clan,

776
00:33:28,835 --> 00:33:29,394
we have to

777
00:33:29,394 --> 00:33:30,634
be fully prepared.

778
00:33:31,674 --> 00:33:33,035
Let's not act recklessly.

779
00:33:33,394 --> 00:33:34,434
Tomorrow afternoon,

780
00:33:34,714 --> 00:33:35,914
we will go there together.

781
00:33:54,584 --> 00:33:57,976
(Twenty years ago)

782
00:34:03,096 --> 00:34:04,632
(Ultimate Frost)

783
00:34:15,955 --> 00:34:16,674
Senior.

784
00:34:17,075 --> 00:34:18,395
You're amazing.

785
00:34:18,915 --> 00:34:20,714
You froze all the hills.

786
00:34:20,915 --> 00:34:22,035
To cultivate a technique

787
00:34:22,274 --> 00:34:23,674
is not about speed and precision.

788
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:24,875
It's about

789
00:34:24,875 --> 00:34:26,475
refining it to its purest.

790
00:34:26,875 --> 00:34:28,595
Once you reach a certain level,

791
00:34:28,794 --> 00:34:29,674
you will obtain

792
00:34:29,674 --> 00:34:31,154
the ultimate power.

793
00:34:31,714 --> 00:34:33,515
Will I be able to master this technique?

794
00:34:35,435 --> 00:34:36,395
Of course.

795
00:34:37,674 --> 00:34:38,354
Junior.

796
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:40,595
You just have to work hard.

797
00:34:41,754 --> 00:34:43,435
Will I be able to surpass you?

798
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:45,115
That's nothing.

799
00:34:45,354 --> 00:34:46,035
Remember,

800
00:34:46,435 --> 00:34:48,754
there are always people better than you.

801
00:34:49,274 --> 00:34:50,475
Train hard.

802
00:34:50,634 --> 00:34:51,314
That's how

803
00:34:51,515 --> 00:34:54,234
you protect the Xia Clan
and the Dragon Mountain Empire.

804
00:35:35,714 --> 00:35:36,354
Senior.

805
00:35:37,515 --> 00:35:38,115
Junior.

806
00:35:38,274 --> 00:35:39,314
Fight to the end.

807
00:35:42,395 --> 00:35:43,234
Master.

808
00:35:46,314 --> 00:35:47,075
Senior.

809
00:35:47,634 --> 00:35:48,875
Are you really leaving?

810
00:35:49,035 --> 00:35:50,915
That's right, Junior.

811
00:35:51,515 --> 00:35:53,194
Stay focused on the cultivation.

812
00:35:53,915 --> 00:35:55,955
The Xia Clan and the Water Daoist Temple

813
00:35:55,955 --> 00:35:57,115
are counting on you.

814
00:35:57,314 --> 00:35:58,754
But the demonic poison you have

815
00:35:58,754 --> 00:35:59,875
can't be unrooted.

816
00:35:59,875 --> 00:36:01,794
Leaving now is like committing suicide.

817
00:36:02,115 --> 00:36:03,754
It's all my fault. I'm useless.

818
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,395
You only got poisoned

819
00:36:05,395 --> 00:36:07,234
because you wanted to protect me.

820
00:36:07,435 --> 00:36:08,194
- I...
- That's enough.

821
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:09,634
Junior.

822
00:36:10,595 --> 00:36:11,515
I believe

823
00:36:12,314 --> 00:36:13,915
you would have

824
00:36:14,075 --> 00:36:15,314
done the same for me.

825
00:36:15,714 --> 00:36:16,515
Because

826
00:36:16,995 --> 00:36:17,875
protecting the Xia Clan

827
00:36:17,875 --> 00:36:19,714
is the job
of our Transcendent organization.

828
00:36:24,154 --> 00:36:24,875
Master.

829
00:36:26,354 --> 00:36:27,515
Please forgive me.

830
00:36:28,314 --> 00:36:29,955
I can't eliminate the demonic poison.

831
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:31,154
If I stay,

832
00:36:31,515 --> 00:36:32,274
I will only

833
00:36:32,274 --> 00:36:33,634
sabotage our reputation.

834
00:36:33,915 --> 00:36:35,995
I cannot inherit your title

835
00:36:35,995 --> 00:36:37,794
as the next Master
of Water Daoist Temple.

836
00:36:39,674 --> 00:36:40,995
My Junior Sikong Yang

837
00:36:41,274 --> 00:36:42,475
is an industrious man

838
00:36:42,674 --> 00:36:43,794
with a bright future.

839
00:36:44,354 --> 00:36:45,515
I recommend him

840
00:36:45,915 --> 00:36:47,595
as the Master of Water Daoist Temple.

841
00:36:48,234 --> 00:36:48,915
Master.

842
00:36:49,995 --> 00:36:51,435
Please forget that you have

843
00:36:51,435 --> 00:36:52,515
taken me in as a disciple.

844
00:37:04,194 --> 00:37:05,035
Senior.

845
00:37:09,995 --> 00:37:10,794
Don't worry.

846
00:37:12,794 --> 00:37:15,354
This place is counting on you.

847
00:37:25,435 --> 00:37:26,714
Twenty years ago,

848
00:37:27,714 --> 00:37:29,995
Senior left Water Daoist Temple.

849
00:37:30,754 --> 00:37:32,555
No one ever heard from him again.

850
00:37:33,995 --> 00:37:35,714
So many years have passed.

851
00:37:35,915 --> 00:37:37,035
I always thought

852
00:37:37,035 --> 00:37:38,395
that he was gone.

853
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:41,194
Is there a chance

854
00:37:41,875 --> 00:37:43,714
that he has renamed himself Bai Yuanzhi

855
00:37:44,194 --> 00:37:45,634
and settled in Yishui City?

856
00:38:25,194 --> 00:38:26,234
Greetings, Second Priest.

857
00:38:26,435 --> 00:38:28,154
We found a new location for the well.

858
00:38:28,955 --> 00:38:29,875
Good.

859
00:38:35,634 --> 00:38:36,674
Great Demon God,

860
00:38:37,075 --> 00:38:38,714
the demons in the Dark Abyss

861
00:38:38,834 --> 00:38:39,395
have found

862
00:38:39,395 --> 00:38:40,555
a new position for the well.

863
00:38:40,834 --> 00:38:42,834
The first sun rays
after the lunar eclipse

864
00:38:43,194 --> 00:38:44,515
will show us the weakest spot

865
00:38:44,515 --> 00:38:46,154
connecting the three realms.

866
00:38:46,995 --> 00:38:48,915
That's where we can
create the Demon Well.

867
00:38:50,035 --> 00:38:51,035
Good.

868
00:38:51,555 --> 00:38:52,955
It looks like I'm one step closer

869
00:38:52,955 --> 00:38:53,834
to my comeback.

870
00:38:54,395 --> 00:38:55,354
Where is the new spot

871
00:38:55,354 --> 00:38:56,154
for the well?

872
00:38:56,274 --> 00:38:57,515
