Young Master, be careful.

23
00:01:49,219 --> 00:01:50,139
Be careful, Young Master.

24
00:01:51,058 --> 00:01:52,818
Young Master, be careful.

25
00:01:53,379 --> 00:01:53,859
Young Master.

26
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:55,258
You don't need to help me. Step back.

Young Master, Young Master, be careful.

What are you afraid of?

This is what I carefully developed,

00:02:07,898 --> 00:02:08,978
As you stick it on,

32
00:02:09,099 --> 00:02:12,258
you can fly

00:02:15,659 --> 00:02:16,578

Are you okay, Young Master?

36
00:02:17,298 --> 00:02:18,379
Young Master, are you fine?

37
00:02:19,659 --> 00:02:20,659
Next time,

38
00:02:21,179 --> 00:02:22,298
I will definitely make it.

39
00:02:22,418 --> 00:02:23,138
Young Master,

40
00:02:23,298 --> 00:02:24,099
you've said that

41
00:02:24,099 --> 00:02:25,578
215 times already.

42
00:02:26,578 --> 00:02:28,698
Are you questioning me?

43
00:02:28,698 --> 00:02:29,978
No, no, no, not at all.

44
00:02:30,738 --> 00:02:32,379
Young Master, in my opinion,

45
00:02:32,459 --> 00:02:33,738
studying on your own here

46
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:34,499
isn't the solution.

47
00:02:34,659 --> 00:02:36,099
You need to find an expert for guidance.

48
00:02:36,179 --> 00:02:36,818
That way, you'll definitely

49
00:02:36,939 --> 00:02:37,578
be able to fly sooner.

50
00:02:37,619 --> 00:02:38,219
Yeah.

51
00:02:38,779 --> 00:02:40,578
Guidance from a pro.

52
00:02:44,298 --> 00:02:44,858
Sister,

53
00:02:44,978 --> 00:02:46,018
where are you traveling

54
00:02:46,099 --> 00:02:47,179
this time?

55
00:02:47,619 --> 00:02:48,578
Take me with you, please.

56
00:02:48,818 --> 00:02:50,379
This time,

57
00:02:50,499 --> 00:02:52,059
I am going on cultivation.

58
00:02:52,499 --> 00:02:54,258
I am trying to get into
the Changfeng Academy.

59
00:02:55,459 --> 00:02:56,379
You?

60
00:02:56,538 --> 00:02:57,619
Changfeng Academy?

61
00:02:58,499 --> 00:03:00,619
You are pulling my leg, right?

62
00:03:00,779 --> 00:03:01,779
You rascal.

63
00:03:01,899 --> 00:03:03,179
Keep laughing.

64
00:03:03,619 --> 00:03:04,499
Ouch, ouch.

65
00:03:06,418 --> 00:03:07,578
But,

66
00:03:07,818 --> 00:03:09,258
how did our father agree to it?

67
00:03:09,418 --> 00:03:10,459
I told him

68
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:11,978
I'm going out to find him

69
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:13,099
a good son-in-law.

70
00:03:14,298 --> 00:03:16,059
You're so bold.

71
00:03:16,418 --> 00:03:17,538
In the Changfeng Academy,

72
00:03:17,538 --> 00:03:18,578
there are all
the most outstanding young talents

73
00:03:18,698 --> 00:03:20,459
from Dragon Mountain Empire.

74
00:03:21,059 --> 00:03:22,619
And their martial arts skills

75
00:03:22,738 --> 00:03:24,418
are the best in the empire.

76
00:03:24,939 --> 00:03:27,899
Especially that Dongbo Xueying.

77
00:03:28,379 --> 00:03:29,659
You just said that

78
00:03:29,779 --> 00:03:31,179
Changfeng Academy

79
00:03:31,379 --> 00:03:32,258
is full of the strongest

80
00:03:32,379 --> 00:03:33,459
who are adept at martial arts
from the empire?

81
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:34,578
Of course.

82
00:03:34,698 --> 00:03:36,379
The Knight Changfeng, Chi Qiubai,

83
00:03:36,499 --> 00:03:38,059
personally teaches

84
00:03:38,138 --> 00:03:39,138
and instructs his disciples.

85
00:03:41,499 --> 00:03:42,219
Chi Qiu...

86
00:03:42,978 --> 00:03:43,698
Wait for me.

87
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:46,379
Kong Hao, I haven't finished yet.

88
00:03:46,499 --> 00:03:48,418
I'm going to Changfeng Academy too.

89
00:03:48,696 --> 00:03:49,720
(Blessing Pavilion)

90
00:03:53,858 --> 00:03:54,858
Take care on the way.

91
00:03:55,018 --> 00:03:56,499
I wish you both success

92
00:03:56,619 --> 00:03:57,858
in passing the assessment
of the Changfeng Academy.

93
00:03:57,978 --> 00:03:59,138
Rest assured, Master.

94
00:03:59,258 --> 00:04:00,738
Thank you
for your hospitality, Master Sikong.

95
00:04:00,899 --> 00:04:01,779
I'll take my leave.

96
00:04:05,784 --> 00:04:12,504
(Water Daoist Temple)

97
00:04:16,178 --> 00:04:17,019
Sister,

98
00:04:17,139 --> 00:04:18,418
why aren't we going in?

99
00:04:18,538 --> 00:04:20,219
What exactly are we waiting for?

100
00:04:24,616 --> 00:04:29,272
(Changfeng Academy)

101
00:04:36,659 --> 00:04:37,779
Finally here.

102
00:04:38,099 --> 00:04:39,819
I want to see if this Changfeng Academy

103
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:40,019
can really help you

104
00:04:40,819 --> 00:04:42,019
become a Transcendent
when you graduate as it is said.

105
00:04:42,139 --> 00:04:43,178
Is it that amazing?

106
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:47,704
(Changfeng Academy)

107
00:04:54,738 --> 00:04:55,418
Girl.

108
00:04:55,978 --> 00:04:57,418
The exam is still some time away.

109
00:04:57,579 --> 00:04:58,938
Don't tire yourself standing here.

110
00:04:59,058 --> 00:04:59,738
Why don't you

111
00:04:59,819 --> 00:05:01,459
rest in my carriage for a while?

112
00:05:03,738 --> 00:05:04,538
Who are you?

113
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:05,459
Stay away from my big sister.

114
00:05:05,538 --> 00:05:06,738
I didn't do anything.

115
00:05:07,058 --> 00:05:07,978
My apologies.

116
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,339
My younger brother is a bit unruly.

117
00:05:09,779 --> 00:05:10,858
I'll take him away right now.

118
00:05:12,459 --> 00:05:14,259
Changfeng Academy
is not like other places.

119
00:05:14,459 --> 00:05:16,418
The examination is extremely important.

120
00:05:16,819 --> 00:05:17,819
Follow me.

121
00:05:17,978 --> 00:05:18,779
Don't be careless.

122
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:19,699
Alright.

123
00:05:19,699 --> 00:05:21,219
Understood, brother.

124
00:05:24,978 --> 00:05:25,779
Oh no.

125
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:27,899
I didn't wear a nice hairpin.

126
00:05:28,298 --> 00:05:30,178
I need to go buy a hairpin now.

127
00:05:30,779 --> 00:05:31,579
Brother,

128
00:05:31,738 --> 00:05:32,498
later on,

129
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:34,019
if Dongbo Xueying comes,

130
00:05:34,178 --> 00:05:34,699
remember

131
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,498
to call me right away.

132
00:05:37,498 --> 00:05:38,738
W-Where are you going?

133
00:05:39,459 --> 00:05:40,618
Sister, isn't that...?

134
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:42,139
I don't even know

135
00:05:42,139 --> 00:05:43,819
what Dongbo Xueying looks like.

136
00:05:44,459 --> 00:05:49,738
Bravo! Bravo! Bravo!

137
00:05:49,899 --> 00:05:50,498
Fantastic!

138
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:52,738
Miss, feel free to browse.

139
00:05:56,779 --> 00:05:57,938
Too small.

140
00:05:58,938 --> 00:05:59,378
Miss,

141
00:05:59,378 --> 00:06:00,579
what about trying this one?

142
00:06:00,699 --> 00:06:02,019
You have such great taste.

143
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,178
I'll take this one.

144
00:06:05,738 --> 00:06:06,938
Here, thank you.

145
00:06:07,738 --> 00:06:09,618
Come, take a look, have a look.

146
00:06:11,178 --> 00:06:13,298
I want this little duck.

147
00:06:13,459 --> 00:06:15,339
Sweetie, but we don't have money.

148
00:06:15,498 --> 00:06:16,178
I will

149
00:06:16,339 --> 00:06:17,618
make you a doll duck when back home,

150
00:06:17,618 --> 00:06:18,298
okay?

151
00:06:18,298 --> 00:06:19,139
I want it.

152
00:06:19,459 --> 00:06:21,579
Little girl, which one do you want?

153
00:06:21,659 --> 00:06:22,219
I will buy it for you.

154
00:06:22,339 --> 00:06:24,019
I want the little duck.

155
00:06:24,019 --> 00:06:24,738
Little duck.

156
00:06:24,738 --> 00:06:25,618
That won't do.

157
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,418
It's fine, it's fine.

158
00:06:26,899 --> 00:06:27,579
Sir,

159
00:06:27,858 --> 00:06:28,858
how much for this?

160
00:06:29,738 --> 00:06:30,659
Miss,

161
00:06:31,219 --> 00:06:32,019
please have a look.

162
00:06:32,378 --> 00:06:34,019
These items are not for sale.

163
00:06:34,178 --> 00:06:35,219
As long as you answer

164
00:06:35,219 --> 00:06:36,058
the questions here correctly,

165
00:06:36,099 --> 00:06:38,498
you can take the corresponding prize

166
00:06:38,618 --> 00:06:39,298
home.

167
00:06:39,618 --> 00:06:40,899
Then there you go.

168
00:06:41,938 --> 00:06:42,858
Miss, don't be impatient.

169
00:06:43,019 --> 00:06:43,899
If you want to answer a question,

170
00:06:44,058 --> 00:06:45,498
you need to spend a hundred coins

171
00:06:45,659 --> 00:06:46,938
to buy a ticket.

172
00:06:47,139 --> 00:06:49,019
(All businessmen are profiteers indeed.)

173
00:06:49,178 --> 00:06:50,738
(You're even better
at business than my father.)

174
00:06:51,058 --> 00:06:51,579
Fine.

175
00:06:52,938 --> 00:06:54,579
I'll buy a ticket.

176
00:06:54,738 --> 00:06:55,978
Miss, please listen to the question.

177
00:06:56,298 --> 00:06:57,339
There are a hundred monks

178
00:06:57,498 --> 00:06:58,699
and a hundred steamed buns.

179
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:01,019
One big monk eats three steamed buns,

180
00:07:01,139 --> 00:07:03,659
while three little monks
share one steamed bun.

181
00:07:03,779 --> 00:07:06,259
The hundred steamed buns
are just enough to be divided.

182
00:07:06,418 --> 00:07:08,498
Please tell me,
how many big and small monks

183
00:07:08,659 --> 00:07:10,139
are there in total?

184
00:07:10,298 --> 00:07:11,938
There are 25 big monks

185
00:07:12,099 --> 00:07:13,339
and 75 little monks.

186
00:07:13,579 --> 00:07:16,058
Great. Bravo!

187
00:07:16,058 --> 00:07:17,099
You are really amazing.

188
00:07:17,099 --> 00:07:18,779
What a smart girl.

189
00:07:21,738 --> 00:07:23,298
Take your prize and leave now.

190
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:25,659
We wanted this one.

191
00:07:25,659 --> 00:07:26,219
How could you give us this?

192
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:27,618
I said it's this one.

193
00:07:27,659 --> 00:07:29,339
How come you don't keep your word?

194
00:07:29,938 --> 00:07:31,779
If you don't leave now,
don't try to do it ever.

195
00:07:31,938 --> 00:07:32,459
You.

196
00:07:35,418 --> 00:07:36,259
Stop.

197
00:07:40,139 --> 00:07:41,298
Come back.

198
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,096
(Shadow Steps)

199
00:07:44,139 --> 00:07:45,538
Someone's stealing.

200
00:07:50,779 --> 00:07:51,858
Come back!

201
00:07:54,058 --> 00:07:55,579
Don't run if you dare.

202
00:08:13,779 --> 00:08:14,418
There you off.

203
00:08:23,099 --> 00:08:24,099
Warrior, please spare my life.

204
00:08:24,259 --> 00:08:25,378
I don't dare to do it again.

205
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:26,699
Warrior, please spare my life.

206
00:08:26,899 --> 00:08:28,099
I don't dare to do it again.

207
00:08:29,858 --> 00:08:30,899
I'm telling you.

208
00:08:31,019 --> 00:08:32,339
Admit defeat for the bet.

209
00:08:32,498 --> 00:08:33,378
You promised to give this

210
00:08:33,378 --> 00:08:34,219
to her.

211
00:08:34,219 --> 00:08:36,219
Warrior, whatever you want,

212
00:08:36,378 --> 00:08:37,018
I'll give it to you.

213
00:08:37,219 --> 00:08:38,099
I'll listen to you.

214
00:08:39,099 --> 00:08:39,658
Here.

215
00:08:41,939 --> 00:08:42,658
Thank you.

216
00:08:44,579 --> 00:08:46,378
Little girl, this is for you.

217
00:08:46,378 --> 00:08:47,778
Thank you, miss.

218
00:08:48,179 --> 00:08:49,778
Listen to your mother.

219
00:08:51,219 --> 00:08:52,539
Say goodbye to the miss.

220
00:08:52,539 --> 00:08:53,498
Big sister, goodbye.

221
00:08:53,498 --> 00:08:54,219
Goodbye.

222
00:08:57,898 --> 00:08:59,579
Thank you for your help.

223
00:08:59,738 --> 00:09:01,179
Your move is quite special.

224
00:09:03,819 --> 00:09:04,618
No.

225
00:09:05,138 --> 00:09:06,699
When I was a kid,
my father always hit me.

226
00:09:06,898 --> 00:09:08,378
And when he hit me,

227
00:09:08,378 --> 00:09:09,939
my mother would ask me to run.

228
00:09:09,939 --> 00:09:11,299
I became good at it
after practicing a lot.

229
00:09:14,658 --> 00:09:16,099
Where's my hairpin?

230
00:09:16,299 --> 00:09:17,858
Hairpin? What hairpin?

231
00:09:18,179 --> 00:09:19,299
I must

232
00:09:19,459 --> 00:09:20,819
lose my hairpin

233
00:09:20,819 --> 00:09:22,219
when the crowd was pushing through.

234
00:09:22,699 --> 00:09:24,539
Use your move to help me find it.

235
00:09:24,658 --> 00:09:25,939
Alright. I...

236
00:09:28,498 --> 00:09:29,939
I can't, miss.

237
00:09:30,099 --> 00:09:31,059
I have something urgent to do.

238
00:09:31,059 --> 00:09:32,539
I have to go to
Changfeng Academy for the exam.

239
00:09:32,699 --> 00:09:34,419
Changfeng Academy?
I'm taking the exam too.

240
00:09:34,579 --> 00:09:35,219
Let's go together.

241
00:09:35,419 --> 00:09:36,219
Really?

242
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,299
Let's hurry up.
We're running out of time.

243
00:09:43,699 --> 00:09:44,539
(Changfeng Academy)
Sister.

244
00:09:44,858 --> 00:09:46,579
Xueying, you're here.

245
00:09:47,138 --> 00:09:47,858
You're here too.

246
00:09:48,658 --> 00:09:50,459
So you're Dongbo Xueying.

247
00:09:51,658 --> 00:09:53,018
Ever since the last time we met

248
00:09:53,018 --> 00:09:53,658
at Snow Stone Fort...

249
00:09:53,778 --> 00:09:54,699
Xueying.

250
00:09:56,179 --> 00:09:57,579
You know them?

251
00:09:59,378 --> 00:10:00,898
We're running out of time
for the exam. Let's go.

252
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:33,099
The Changfeng Academy exam

253
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,339
now begins.

254
00:10:34,539 --> 00:10:35,459
The exam is

255
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:37,258
to pass through this door
and enter that door.

256
00:10:37,419 --> 00:10:38,738
Those who pass through that door

257
00:10:38,898 --> 00:10:39,498
will become

258
00:10:39,498 --> 00:10:40,819
the disciples of Changfeng Academy.

259
00:10:41,498 --> 00:10:42,618
Ms. Tanshi,

260
00:10:42,738 --> 00:10:43,978
you've been talking for so long,

261
00:10:43,978 --> 00:10:45,618
but you didn't tell us

262
00:10:45,778 --> 00:10:47,018
where on earth the doors are.

263
00:10:58,618 --> 00:10:59,978
This door is right here.

264
00:11:00,539 --> 00:11:01,978
As for where that door is,

265
00:11:02,138 --> 00:11:03,658
it's up to your own abilities.

266
00:11:17,498 --> 00:11:19,339
Although this passage seems ordinary,

267
00:11:19,539 --> 00:11:21,138
it must hide a mystery.

268
00:11:21,459 --> 00:11:22,579
I think so too.

269
00:11:22,778 --> 00:11:23,778
The exam of Changfeng Academy

270
00:11:23,778 --> 00:11:24,778
won't be this simple.

271
00:11:24,939 --> 00:11:26,219
We should still be careful.

272
00:11:39,258 --> 00:11:41,059
Don't rush.
Let's make clear the situation first.

273
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,059
In the world of martial arts,

274
00:11:42,059 --> 00:11:43,059
only speed is invincible.

275
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,378
It's just a door, right?

276
00:11:44,539 --> 00:11:45,579
Once I pass this door,

277
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:46,179
I'll be

278
00:11:46,179 --> 00:11:47,738
a disciple of Changfeng Academy.

279
00:11:47,898 --> 00:11:48,738
Watch me.

280
00:11:59,018 --> 00:12:00,018
Why am I still here?

281
00:12:03,138 --> 00:12:03,819
Try again.

282
00:12:11,939 --> 00:12:13,738
Sister, let's use wisdom.

283
00:12:16,018 --> 00:12:17,378
Look at my Flying Seal.

284
00:12:23,138 --> 00:12:24,978
Hao, be careful.

285
00:12:25,138 --> 00:12:26,618
Isn't this very simple?

286
00:12:28,018 --> 00:12:28,819
Let's go.

287
00:12:35,378 --> 00:12:35,939
Hao.

288
00:12:37,219 --> 00:12:37,978
Hao.

289
00:12:39,378 --> 00:12:40,339
Are you okay?

290
00:12:40,858 --> 00:12:41,618
I'm fine.

291
00:12:42,699 --> 00:12:44,579
The passage you see before you

292
00:12:44,658 --> 00:12:45,618
is not as easy

293
00:12:45,618 --> 00:12:46,419
as it seems.

294
00:12:46,618 --> 00:12:48,419
The real challenge is yet to come.

295
00:12:48,858 --> 00:12:50,179
If you can't overcome

296
00:12:50,378 --> 00:12:51,819
your own weaknesses,

297
00:12:52,018 --> 00:12:53,898
you won't pass the test.

298
00:12:54,539 --> 00:12:55,819
How do you know that?

299
00:12:55,978 --> 00:12:57,939
I've been taking the test for 38 years.

300
00:12:58,539 --> 00:13:00,059
It's not that easy.

301
00:13:05,858 --> 00:13:06,539
It's okay.

302
00:13:07,539 --> 00:13:08,579
Just follow me.

303
00:13:59,898 --> 00:14:00,419
(Why are there)

304
00:14:00,618 --> 00:14:01,459
(so many men in black?)

305
00:14:01,658 --> 00:14:02,618
(What's going on?)

306
00:14:18,059 --> 00:14:19,378
How did I end up here?

307
00:14:20,539 --> 00:14:22,299
My father never allows me to come here.

308
00:14:29,579 --> 00:14:30,498
I didn't expect

309
00:14:30,658 --> 00:14:31,498
my father actually allowed me to see

310
00:14:31,699 --> 00:14:33,138
the Kong family's account book.

311
00:14:33,419 --> 00:14:35,539
My father actually agreed to
let me do business.

312
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:07,539
Changfeng Academy is great.

313
00:15:07,738 --> 00:15:08,939
They're afraid I'll
get hungry during the exam,

314
00:15:08,939 --> 00:15:10,138
so they prepared
so many delicious things.

315
00:16:03,299 --> 00:16:03,978
No.

316
00:16:06,618 --> 00:16:07,579
It is not real.

317
00:16:08,658 --> 00:16:09,579
This is an illusion.

318
00:16:10,618 --> 00:16:11,378
My mother was taken away.

319
00:16:11,378 --> 00:16:12,459
This is my demon.

320
00:16:13,978 --> 00:16:15,579
(If I lose my Flying Snow Spear,)

321
00:16:15,778 --> 00:16:17,339
(I will definitely fail the exam.)

322
00:16:18,179 --> 00:16:18,978
(I can't panic.)

323
00:16:19,219 --> 00:16:20,219
(I must stay calm.)

324
00:16:21,059 --> 00:16:22,219
(Since it's an illusion,)

325
00:16:22,498 --> 00:16:24,018
(I can do anything.)

326
00:16:40,539 --> 00:16:42,419
Jingqiu, Jingqiu, wake up.

327
00:16:42,419 --> 00:16:44,059
Jingqiu, Jingqiu.

328
00:16:45,459 --> 00:16:46,459
It was just an illusion.

329
00:16:46,738 --> 00:16:47,658
It wasn't real.

330
00:16:48,179 --> 00:16:49,419
These were all dreams?

331
00:16:49,419 --> 00:16:50,339
Not real?

332
00:16:50,419 --> 00:16:51,099
Not real.

333
00:16:54,618 --> 00:16:56,258
Xueying Territory.

334
00:16:56,898 --> 00:16:58,258
Xueying Territory.

335
00:16:59,018 --> 00:17:00,378
Xueying.

336
00:17:02,219 --> 00:17:02,939
That's not right.

337
00:17:03,498 --> 00:17:04,458
I came to take the exam

338
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,739
at Changfeng Academy, didn't I?

339
00:17:06,539 --> 00:17:08,698
Xueying came to Changfeng Academy.

340
00:17:09,019 --> 00:17:10,898
I need to find Xueying.

341
00:17:11,539 --> 00:17:12,299
How...

342
00:17:12,579 --> 00:17:13,418
How did I end up sitting here

343
00:17:13,418 --> 00:17:14,579
and reading the account book?

344
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,178
Hallucination.

345
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:22,378
This works too.

346
00:17:23,819 --> 00:17:25,259
Kong Hao, that silly boy.

347
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:26,658
He must be thinking

348
00:17:26,658 --> 00:17:28,178
his spell seals succeeded.

349
00:17:30,218 --> 00:17:31,138
Our father said

350
00:17:31,138 --> 00:17:32,698
you would be in charge of
the Kong family's business.

351
00:17:33,138 --> 00:17:33,938
No, no, no.

352
00:17:44,579 --> 00:17:45,698
Wake up.

353
00:17:46,979 --> 00:17:48,819
You're still biting? Look.

354
00:17:48,819 --> 00:17:50,218
Look what you've bit it into.

355
00:17:54,579 --> 00:17:57,378
The chicken feet, the pig's trotters...

356
00:17:57,378 --> 00:17:58,099
A-All were...

357
00:18:05,779 --> 00:18:07,138
We are eliminated?

358
00:18:07,339 --> 00:18:08,339
Fine, let's go.

359
00:18:09,979 --> 00:18:10,979
Xueying, look.

360
00:18:11,579 --> 00:18:12,259
Qian.

361
00:18:13,418 --> 00:18:17,339
There are also Kun, Li, and Gen.

362
00:18:18,218 --> 00:18:19,579
These are all directions.

363
00:18:20,458 --> 00:18:21,218
I understand.

364
00:18:21,658 --> 00:18:22,898
As long as we defeat the nightmares,

365
00:18:23,339 --> 00:18:24,698
there will be new characters.

366
00:18:25,138 --> 00:18:25,898
If we can figure out

367
00:18:25,898 --> 00:18:27,059
the pattern of these characters,

368
00:18:27,299 --> 00:18:28,698
we may be able to break the array.

369
00:18:29,618 --> 00:18:30,138
Quick.

370
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:31,819
Let's wake everyone up first.

371
00:18:38,059 --> 00:18:39,979
Rude. One more.

372
00:18:45,059 --> 00:18:45,938
So rude.

373
00:18:46,019 --> 00:18:47,099
Wake up, wake up.

374
00:18:47,539 --> 00:18:48,618
You smell good.

375
00:18:49,618 --> 00:18:50,339
Wake up.

376
00:18:51,099 --> 00:18:51,658
Wake up.

377
00:18:51,658 --> 00:18:52,378
Boring.

378
00:18:52,858 --> 00:18:54,779
How can this be a dream?

379
00:18:54,979 --> 00:18:56,499
It's so real.

380
00:18:57,378 --> 00:18:59,898
Situ Hong, wake up, wake up.

381
00:19:00,178 --> 00:19:02,299
(Now that you've joined my Si Family,)

382
00:19:02,499 --> 00:19:03,819
(you must work hard to cultivate)

383
00:19:04,099 --> 00:19:06,218
(as we Si Family
never raises the useless.)

384
00:19:07,739 --> 00:19:09,259
He'll die if this continues.

385
00:19:09,579 --> 00:19:10,499
I'll figure it out.

386
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:24,898
I will become

387
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,979
the first place at Changfeng Academy.

388
00:19:38,499 --> 00:19:40,378
These were all dreams. Not real.

389
00:19:43,059 --> 00:19:43,858
Thank you.

390
00:19:44,739 --> 00:19:45,458
You're welcome.

391
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:01,938
Everyone, step back.

392
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:03,378
Be careful.

393
00:20:13,499 --> 00:20:15,259
(Changfeng Academy)
I'll be back next year.

394
00:20:27,938 --> 00:20:29,698
Xueying, look.

395
00:20:29,979 --> 00:20:30,779
These characters

396
00:20:30,779 --> 00:20:32,378
though seem move
chaotically and rapidly,

397
00:20:32,579 --> 00:20:33,539
in fact,

398
00:20:33,618 --> 00:20:35,658
the sum and difference of each row's
horizontal and vertical lines are seven.

399
00:20:36,299 --> 00:20:36,938
Look,

400
00:20:37,218 --> 00:20:38,378
the center.

401
00:20:38,579 --> 00:20:39,858
No matter how the characters move,

402
00:20:39,898 --> 00:20:40,739
it will always form

403
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,059
the shape of the Big Dipper.

404
00:20:42,299 --> 00:20:43,099
Presumably,

405
00:20:43,099 --> 00:20:43,819
as long as we move towards

406
00:20:43,819 --> 00:20:45,059
this Big Dipper,

407
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:46,658
we'll definitely reach "that door."

408
00:20:47,019 --> 00:20:47,858
I'll give it a try.

409
00:20:48,339 --> 00:20:49,099
Hold on.

410
00:20:49,779 --> 00:20:51,418
The stars that form the Big Dipper are

411
00:20:51,418 --> 00:20:53,299
Dubhe, Merak,

412
00:20:53,499 --> 00:20:54,858
Phecda, Megrez,

413
00:20:55,138 --> 00:20:56,938
Alioth, Mizar, and Alkaid.

414
00:20:57,218 --> 00:20:58,618
Each star has its own attributes.

415
00:20:58,819 --> 00:21:00,299
Dubhe is the hub of the seven stars.

416
00:21:00,539 --> 00:21:01,858
Merak is responsible for rotation.

417
00:21:02,059 --> 00:21:03,499
Phecda masters change.

418
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:05,019
Megrez holds power.

419
00:21:05,218 --> 00:21:06,739
Alioth balances weight.

420
00:21:06,739 --> 00:21:08,178
Mizar opens Yang Qi.

421
00:21:08,378 --> 00:21:09,779
Alkaid represents brightness.

422
00:21:09,979 --> 00:21:10,938
Among these seven stars,

423
00:21:10,938 --> 00:21:11,858
Merak and Phecda,

424
00:21:11,858 --> 00:21:13,579
rotation and change,
are the most difficult to control.

425
00:21:13,779 --> 00:21:14,618
I'm afraid there might be danger.

426
00:21:14,779 --> 00:21:15,499
When landing,

427
00:21:15,698 --> 00:21:16,539
try not to land on

428
00:21:16,539 --> 00:21:17,779
these two stars.

429
00:21:19,579 --> 00:21:21,458
Why don't you give it a try this time?

430
00:21:22,178 --> 00:21:22,819
I'll do it.

431
00:21:39,019 --> 00:21:40,979
The Dipper's handle points east.
Alkaid is in the west.

432
00:21:41,339 --> 00:21:43,099
Merak and Phecda are at the bottom.

433
00:21:45,059 --> 00:21:46,739
Dubhe is for heaven
and Merak is for earth.

434
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,299
Phecda for men,
Megrez for time, Alioth for sound,

435
00:21:49,499 --> 00:21:51,218
Mizar for law, and Alkaid for stars.

436
00:21:51,458 --> 00:21:52,618
Among these seven stars,

437
00:21:52,618 --> 00:21:54,618
Alioth is the brightest,
while Megrez is the dimmest.

438
00:21:54,819 --> 00:21:55,858
Just find the positions
of these two stars

439
00:21:55,858 --> 00:21:57,299
based on brightness,

440
00:21:57,499 --> 00:21:58,979
and then determine
the different directions

441
00:21:59,138 --> 00:22:00,378
according to the Dipper's handle.

442
00:22:13,819 --> 00:22:14,618
Great.

443
00:22:22,579 --> 00:22:23,138
Sister!

444
00:22:31,539 --> 00:22:32,339
Congratulations, everyone,

445
00:22:32,339 --> 00:22:33,779
for passing
the Changfeng Academy's exam.

446
00:22:33,938 --> 00:22:34,499
Passed!

447
00:22:34,499 --> 00:22:36,339
Great, bravo, great!

448
00:22:36,339 --> 00:22:37,259
Finally passed.

449
00:22:37,779 --> 00:22:38,418
Good.

450
00:22:38,979 --> 00:22:39,938
Great.

451
00:22:39,979 --> 00:22:40,698
Bravo.

452
00:22:41,178 --> 00:22:42,858
Hurry up, hurry up.

453
00:22:43,658 --> 00:22:45,378
Don't you hurry up and greet your Dean,

454
00:22:47,019 --> 00:22:48,178
Knight Changfeng?

455
00:22:49,339 --> 00:22:50,938
Greetings, Dean.

456
00:22:52,299 --> 00:22:53,218
You all are

457
00:22:53,218 --> 00:22:54,579
the future guardians of
Dragon Mountain Empire.

458
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:56,019
I hope you can

459
00:22:56,019 --> 00:22:58,259
practice diligently,
maintain your true nature,

460
00:22:58,458 --> 00:22:59,499
and forge together

461
00:22:59,698 --> 00:23:01,059
to protect Dragon Mountain Empire

462
00:23:01,259 --> 00:23:02,299
and the Xia Clan.

463
00:23:03,138 --> 00:23:04,138
Yes!

464
00:23:09,618 --> 00:23:10,579
Not bad.

465
00:23:10,618 --> 00:23:11,739
Yes.

466
00:23:16,458 --> 00:23:17,418
Look at that mountain.

467
00:23:17,979 --> 00:23:18,499
(Orchid & Bamboo Yard)
Yes.

468
00:23:19,658 --> 00:23:20,579
This is Orchid & Bamboo Yard,

469
00:23:20,779 --> 00:23:22,178
your dormitory.

470
00:23:22,499 --> 00:23:23,458
Go in and have a look.

471
00:23:34,658 --> 00:23:36,218
The living conditions here

472
00:23:36,218 --> 00:23:37,739
are too simple, aren't they?

473
00:23:37,938 --> 00:23:39,819
It's simpler than my kitchen.

474
00:23:40,858 --> 00:23:42,618
This is not like
the conditions you had at home.

475
00:23:42,819 --> 00:23:43,458
Coming here

476
00:23:43,458 --> 00:23:44,499
is mainly for cultivation

477
00:23:44,698 --> 00:23:45,898
to improve your martial arts skills.

478
00:23:46,138 --> 00:23:47,658
Yes, Dean Changfeng.

479
00:23:47,658 --> 00:23:49,299
I'm okay with living here.

480
00:23:52,019 --> 00:23:53,299
That small Practice Field,

481
00:23:53,499 --> 00:23:54,218
where you

482
00:23:54,218 --> 00:23:55,138
practice martial arts.

483
00:23:55,579 --> 00:23:57,059
Without my permission,

484
00:23:57,378 --> 00:23:58,299
do not trespass anywhere else.

485
00:23:59,019 --> 00:23:59,779
That's it?

486
00:23:59,979 --> 00:24:01,779
It's not enough for me
to show my skills.

487
00:24:03,339 --> 00:24:03,898
Alright.

488
00:24:04,019 --> 00:24:05,458
Get settled and rest early.

489
00:24:05,539 --> 00:24:06,418
I live in the row behind,

490
00:24:06,418 --> 00:24:07,499
in the westernmost room.

491
00:24:07,698 --> 00:24:09,858
If you have any questions,
you can reach out.

492
00:24:11,059 --> 00:24:11,698
Master.

493
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:13,579
Master.

494
00:24:14,059 --> 00:24:15,698
I just want to ask

495
00:24:15,898 --> 00:24:17,418
where the female disciples live.

496
00:24:19,418 --> 00:24:21,458
Why? What's so funny?

497
00:24:21,618 --> 00:24:22,779
I want to find a Transcendent

498
00:24:22,819 --> 00:24:23,339
to be my wife.

499
00:24:23,339 --> 00:24:24,339
Of course, I need to know

500
00:24:24,339 --> 00:24:25,618
where my wife lives.

501
00:24:25,618 --> 00:24:26,618
I think

502
00:24:26,618 --> 00:24:27,458
you are

503
00:24:27,458 --> 00:24:28,458
aiming at the moon.

504
00:24:28,458 --> 00:24:29,259
Borong.

505
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:30,819
The female disciples

506
00:24:30,819 --> 00:24:32,138
live in the Flower Pavilion next door.

507
00:24:32,378 --> 00:24:33,658
You'll have classes together,

508
00:24:33,858 --> 00:24:34,858
so you'll meet them.

509
00:24:36,218 --> 00:24:37,339
Get some rest early.

510
00:24:38,458 --> 00:24:40,539
Farewell, Dean Changfeng.

511
00:24:46,739 --> 00:24:48,779
I'm exhausted from working all day.

512
00:24:50,019 --> 00:24:51,418
This bed is too hard.

513
00:24:51,418 --> 00:24:52,579
How can I sleep, brother?

514
00:24:52,819 --> 00:24:53,938
Don't be so picky.

515
00:24:54,138 --> 00:24:55,739
It's not like being at home
when you're outside.

516
00:24:55,938 --> 00:24:56,858
Just make do.

517
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,178
Yeah, you can make do.

518
00:24:58,378 --> 00:24:59,178
But we still have to be here

519
00:24:59,178 --> 00:25:00,418
for three years.

520
00:25:00,658 --> 00:25:01,698
The big beds we slept in at home

521
00:25:01,698 --> 00:25:03,739
are made of Phoebe sheareri.

522
00:25:04,218 --> 00:25:05,138
The soft cotton wadding

523
00:25:05,138 --> 00:25:06,259
stitched with silk and satin

524
00:25:06,259 --> 00:25:07,579
is so comfortable.

525
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:08,458
Have you ever slept

526
00:25:08,458 --> 00:25:09,658
in such a comfortable bed?

527
00:25:09,898 --> 00:25:11,418
I know, I know.

528
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:13,138
Just like lying on a cloud,

529
00:25:13,299 --> 00:25:14,378
it dissipates all the fatigue

530
00:25:14,378 --> 00:25:15,579
from your body.

531
00:25:15,579 --> 00:25:16,658
Alright, alright.

532
00:25:16,658 --> 00:25:17,618
Stop living in castles in the air.

533
00:25:17,819 --> 00:25:18,938
Face reality instead.

534
00:25:20,259 --> 00:25:21,019
Everyone,

535
00:25:21,339 --> 00:25:23,339
my younger brother and I
are from the Si Mansion in Nanqin.

536
00:25:23,539 --> 00:25:24,618
From now on, we are fellow disciples.

537
00:25:24,779 --> 00:25:26,418
Please take care of us.

538
00:25:26,539 --> 00:25:28,019
Take care, take care.

539
00:25:28,698 --> 00:25:30,499
The Si Family? I know.

540
00:25:30,618 --> 00:25:31,579
Is it the one that

541
00:25:31,579 --> 00:25:32,938
had an accident guarding the Demon Well

542
00:25:32,938 --> 00:25:34,178
and letting the demons enter

543
00:25:34,178 --> 00:25:34,938
Dragon Mountain Empire?

544
00:25:42,618 --> 00:25:43,739
It is said that the Si Family

545
00:25:43,858 --> 00:25:44,979
optimized your martial arts system

546
00:25:44,979 --> 00:25:45,779
based on the local conditions

547
00:25:45,938 --> 00:25:47,858
during your guard in Nanqin

548
00:25:48,099 --> 00:25:49,618
and you can play the martial arts
more nimbly and easily.

549
00:25:49,858 --> 00:25:50,618
I'd really like to

550
00:25:50,979 --> 00:25:52,299
have a look at it someday.

551
00:25:52,858 --> 00:25:54,259
You're welcome
to come and learn anytime.

552
00:25:54,739 --> 00:25:55,938
You're also welcome

553
00:25:56,178 --> 00:25:57,979
to visit the Si Family
in Nanqin anytime.

554
00:25:59,218 --> 00:25:59,898
I'm sorry,

555
00:25:59,898 --> 00:26:01,259
I didn't mean that just now.

556
00:26:01,458 --> 00:26:02,739
I think you did it on purpose.

557
00:26:02,739 --> 00:26:03,378
Borong.

558
00:26:04,898 --> 00:26:06,898
I've heard about
the Si Family for a long time.

559
00:26:07,099 --> 00:26:08,099
Today, I see that

560
00:26:08,138 --> 00:26:10,059
both of you are indeed extraordinary.

561
00:26:10,178 --> 00:26:11,378
Hello, Mr. Situ.

562
00:26:11,378 --> 00:26:13,059
I'm from the Kong Family in Yishui City.

563
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:14,618
I've heard about
your high martial arts skills.

564
00:26:14,618 --> 00:26:15,858
Please give me
some guidance in the future.

565
00:26:16,138 --> 00:26:17,378
No need to be so polite.

566
00:26:17,539 --> 00:26:19,418
The Kong Family's armory is famous.

567
00:26:19,418 --> 00:26:20,618
I heard about it long ago.

568
00:26:20,819 --> 00:26:22,259
It's a great honor

569
00:26:22,378 --> 00:26:23,858
to be fellow disciples this time.

570
00:26:28,698 --> 00:26:29,979
Your name is Dongbo Xueying?

571
00:26:30,739 --> 00:26:31,979
My name is Puyang Bo.

572
00:26:32,178 --> 00:26:33,858
Thanks for your help just now.

573
00:26:37,658 --> 00:26:38,579
Don't you have luggage?

574
00:26:41,618 --> 00:26:43,099
I didn't bring much.

575
00:26:43,339 --> 00:26:44,218
I've been used to living a carefree life

576
00:26:44,339 --> 00:26:45,218
since I was little,

577
00:26:45,339 --> 00:26:46,138
eating at other people's homes.

578
00:26:46,618 --> 00:26:47,739
Moreover, everything

579
00:26:47,898 --> 00:26:48,539
is provided here,

580
00:26:48,658 --> 00:26:49,539
so I don't need anything.

581
00:26:49,698 --> 00:26:50,539
I'm not that particular.

582
00:26:50,979 --> 00:26:52,138
You're not particular.

583
00:26:52,218 --> 00:26:52,698
But can't you

584
00:26:52,779 --> 00:26:54,059
consider others?

585
00:26:54,178 --> 00:26:55,418
How long has it been
since you washed your clothes?

586
00:26:55,539 --> 00:26:56,458
They stink.

587
00:26:58,218 --> 00:26:59,059
Do they stink?

588
00:26:59,178 --> 00:27:00,539
I think they're quite good. Smell good.

589
00:27:00,539 --> 00:27:01,499
Why don't you smell me?

590
00:27:01,499 --> 00:27:02,019
Okay?

591
00:27:02,378 --> 00:27:03,178
Don't come over.

592
00:27:03,418 --> 00:27:04,499
So stinky.

593
00:27:24,858 --> 00:27:25,898
Yu Jingqiu,

594
00:27:26,418 --> 00:27:27,299
when did you

595
00:27:27,458 --> 00:27:28,458
get to know Dongbo Xueying?

596
00:27:29,698 --> 00:27:30,539
Not long ago.

597
00:27:30,658 --> 00:27:32,099
How long ago is "not long ago"?

598
00:27:32,218 --> 00:27:33,339
A month ago?

599
00:27:33,458 --> 00:27:34,539
A year ago?

600
00:27:34,658 --> 00:27:35,579
I can't remember.

601
00:27:36,059 --> 00:27:37,099
Miss Youyue,

602
00:27:37,178 --> 00:27:38,218
we still have to practice tomorrow.

603
00:27:38,299 --> 00:27:39,339
Get some rest early.

604
00:27:46,739 --> 00:27:48,059
What makes you so proud?

605
00:27:48,218 --> 00:27:49,299
Pretending to be aloof.

606
00:27:49,418 --> 00:27:51,378
Cold as ice, just like your spells.

607
00:28:01,499 --> 00:28:03,259
Come with me.

608
00:28:03,259 --> 00:28:04,218
Who is that?

609
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:05,138
Help!

610
00:28:05,618 --> 00:28:06,378
Let go of Youyue.

611
00:28:06,499 --> 00:28:06,898
Who are you?

612
00:28:06,898 --> 00:28:09,099
I just came to

613
00:28:09,138 --> 00:28:11,458
see my new roommates.

614
00:28:14,579 --> 00:28:18,938
Changfeng Academy is so boring.

615
00:28:20,299 --> 00:28:23,779
You'll miss me soon.

616
00:28:23,898 --> 00:28:25,458
She does this every year.

617
00:28:25,618 --> 00:28:27,059
She hasn't gotten tired of it
after all these years.

618
00:28:27,299 --> 00:28:28,658
I was scared to death.

619
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:29,739
Who is she?

620
00:28:29,858 --> 00:28:31,539
She is Senior Lanxin.

621
00:28:31,658 --> 00:28:33,138
She keeps failing the assessments,

622
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:33,938
so she has been practicing

623
00:28:33,938 --> 00:28:35,099
in Changfeng Academy.

624
00:28:35,259 --> 00:28:37,299
This year should be

625
00:28:37,938 --> 00:28:38,858
her seventh year.

626
00:28:39,378 --> 00:28:40,779
Seven years.

627
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:42,178
Such a long time.

628
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:43,499
She has wasted her prime

629
00:28:43,658 --> 00:28:45,458
in Changfeng Academy,

630
00:28:45,618 --> 00:28:46,499
practicing martial arts?

631
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:47,178
Yeah.

632
00:28:47,299 --> 00:28:48,739
That's why she knows Changfeng Academy

633
00:28:48,858 --> 00:28:49,938
like the back of her hand

634
00:28:50,019 --> 00:28:51,339
and has mixed feelings about it.

635
00:28:51,418 --> 00:28:52,138
She likes to bully

636
00:28:52,259 --> 00:28:53,378
newcomers the most.

637
00:28:53,579 --> 00:28:54,218
You girls,

638
00:28:54,378 --> 00:28:55,618
do remember not to provoke her.

639
00:28:55,779 --> 00:28:57,539
I won't provoke her.

640
00:28:57,779 --> 00:28:58,378
Let's go.

641
00:29:06,938 --> 00:29:08,979
Thank you.

642
00:29:09,138 --> 00:29:09,819
It's nothing.

643
00:29:36,979 --> 00:29:38,938
(He seems to be
a martial arts fanatic too.)

644
00:29:39,979 --> 00:29:41,178
(The stronger the people around me,)

645
00:29:41,499 --> 00:29:42,299
(the more I know about)

646
00:29:42,299 --> 00:29:43,259
(my own shortcomings.)

647
00:29:44,299 --> 00:29:45,579
(The strong is stronger.)

648
00:29:46,178 --> 00:29:47,499
(Only by becoming stronger myself)

649
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:49,819
(can I have a better chance of
defeating Moyang Chen.)

650
00:29:51,124 --> 00:29:53,400
(Flower Pavilion)

651
00:30:11,378 --> 00:30:12,618
(Yu Jingqiu)

652
00:30:12,739 --> 00:30:14,618
(isn't so bad after all.)

653
00:30:14,819 --> 00:30:16,138
(Although not as pretty as me,)

654
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:17,418
(her martial arts skills are strong,)

655
00:30:17,579 --> 00:30:18,938
(so she can protect me.)

656
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:21,339
(Wait, no.)

657
00:30:22,259 --> 00:30:23,458
(She and Dongbo Xueying.)

658
00:30:23,618 --> 00:30:25,458
(Even though she just helped me,)

659
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:27,339
(their relationship)

660
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,739
(is a bit ambiguous.)

661
00:30:36,458 --> 00:30:37,938
(Bad luck.)

662
00:30:43,819 --> 00:30:46,099
Greetings, Masters.

663
00:30:46,658 --> 00:30:47,858
Starting today,

664
00:30:48,218 --> 00:30:49,618
Ms. Tanshi and I will

665
00:30:49,618 --> 00:30:51,019
teach you the basic courses.

666
00:30:51,418 --> 00:30:53,019
What are basic courses?

667
00:30:53,579 --> 00:30:54,898
Basic courses are designed to

668
00:30:54,898 --> 00:30:56,138
provide some basic concepts

669
00:30:56,218 --> 00:30:57,458
and basic knowledge

670
00:30:57,579 --> 00:30:58,698
for your future learning.

671
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:00,339
When can we take

672
00:31:00,499 --> 00:31:01,898
more advanced spell courses?

673
00:31:02,059 --> 00:31:03,178
When you truly master

674
00:31:03,339 --> 00:31:04,059
the basic courses,

675
00:31:04,218 --> 00:31:05,698
you will be able to improve

676
00:31:05,858 --> 00:31:08,059
your advanced spell skills
and the use of Dou Qi

677
00:31:08,178 --> 00:31:09,458
according to
your cultivation categories.

678
00:31:11,898 --> 00:31:13,858
Different colored crystals
merging together

679
00:31:13,979 --> 00:31:15,339
will have different effects.

680
00:31:15,418 --> 00:31:17,259
For example,
when pink and white crystals merge,

681
00:31:17,378 --> 00:31:18,499
they can heal wounds

682
00:31:18,658 --> 00:31:19,658
and help with recovery.

683
00:31:28,218 --> 00:31:29,458
That's amazing.

684
00:31:33,858 --> 00:31:34,499
Then,

685
00:31:34,658 --> 00:31:36,138
what will happen

686
00:31:36,299 --> 00:31:37,299
when red and green crystals
are combined?

687
00:31:37,458 --> 00:31:38,299
You can try it.

688
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:40,458
Pink and white crystals

689
00:31:40,458 --> 00:31:42,138
are the two most basic crystals.

690
00:31:42,259 --> 00:31:43,898
To control and merge

691
00:31:44,019 --> 00:31:46,099
crystals with higher energy,

692
00:31:46,259 --> 00:31:47,779
it's not an easy task.

693
00:31:47,938 --> 00:31:48,938
You shall

694
00:31:48,938 --> 00:31:49,579
start with the basics.

695
00:31:49,579 --> 00:31:50,819
What's so difficult about it?

696
00:31:50,979 --> 00:31:51,898
I'll show you.

697
00:32:01,539 --> 00:32:02,819
This may seem simple,

698
00:32:02,979 --> 00:32:03,938
but it's the best way to train

699
00:32:03,938 --> 00:32:05,138
your natural control power.

700
00:32:05,218 --> 00:32:07,539
Whether you are a knight or a mage,

701
00:32:07,658 --> 00:32:09,218
you need to
establish a solid foundation.

702
00:32:09,339 --> 00:32:10,499
Only with a solid foundation

703
00:32:10,658 --> 00:32:11,579
can you flourish

704
00:32:11,739 --> 00:32:12,618
and bear abundant fruit.

705
00:32:14,339 --> 00:32:15,138
Yu Jingqiu,

706
00:32:15,618 --> 00:32:16,858
show everyone an example.

707
00:32:38,458 --> 00:32:39,378
So beautiful.

708
00:32:45,618 --> 00:32:46,658
That's amazing.

709
00:32:46,658 --> 00:32:47,658
Awesome.

710
00:32:47,698 --> 00:32:48,539
Fantastic.

711
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:49,938
It's quite impressive.

712
00:32:50,019 --> 00:32:50,658
Can this

713
00:32:50,658 --> 00:32:51,819
create something edible?

714
00:33:02,378 --> 00:33:03,138
Is that true?

715
00:33:03,138 --> 00:33:04,019
It's a real fish?

716
00:33:04,059 --> 00:33:05,059
Is it edible?

717
00:33:10,299 --> 00:33:11,339
I see.

718
00:33:11,979 --> 00:33:13,539
Amazing. Yeah.

719
00:33:17,378 --> 00:33:18,299
(What kind of fish is this?)

720
00:33:18,299 --> 00:33:19,499
(The fish grilled by
Dongbo Xueying, Snow Eagle Lord,)

721
00:33:19,499 --> 00:33:20,658
(must be snowfish for sure.)

722
00:33:22,059 --> 00:33:22,779
Alright.

723
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:24,779
Everyone, take Yu Jingqiu as an example

724
00:33:24,858 --> 00:33:25,819
and practice more.

725
00:33:25,979 --> 00:33:27,378
Yes.

726
00:33:33,779 --> 00:33:35,378
(Soul Spear is basic.)

727
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:36,579
(Martial arts is the foundation.)

728
00:33:36,819 --> 00:33:38,099
(However things change,
they will still retain their essence.)

729
00:33:38,898 --> 00:33:40,218
(Master is right.)

730
00:34:01,618 --> 00:34:02,979
Xueying is amazing.

731
00:34:10,698 --> 00:34:11,258
Master.

732
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:14,298
Well done.

733
00:34:15,099 --> 00:34:15,859
This lesson is about

734
00:34:15,859 --> 00:34:17,178
mastering the Dou Qi accurately

735
00:34:17,298 --> 00:34:18,499
in a stable, sharp, and severe way.

736
00:34:18,979 --> 00:34:19,859
Although you have mastered

737
00:34:19,859 --> 00:34:20,859
the essence of basic law,

738
00:34:20,979 --> 00:34:22,138
do not get distracted

739
00:34:22,258 --> 00:34:23,138
when practicing.

740
00:34:25,459 --> 00:34:26,539
Yes, Master.

741
00:34:30,658 --> 00:34:31,419
Jingqiu.

742
00:34:37,138 --> 00:34:37,899
Uncle Master.

743
00:34:38,579 --> 00:34:40,298
At the Water Daoist Temple,
I am your senior.

744
00:34:40,459 --> 00:34:41,539
But after you entered Changfeng Academy,

745
00:34:41,658 --> 00:34:42,298
you are the same as everyone else,

746
00:34:42,298 --> 00:34:43,338
so you could just call me Master.

747
00:34:44,338 --> 00:34:45,539
Yes, Master.

748
00:34:49,178 --> 00:34:50,138
Get out of the way. Make ways.

749
00:34:50,138 --> 00:34:50,859
Watch out.

750
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:52,019
Be careful, be careful.

751
00:34:52,539 --> 00:34:53,419
Careful.

752
00:35:05,138 --> 00:35:05,939
I'm sorry.

753
00:35:06,099 --> 00:35:07,698
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

754
00:35:07,818 --> 00:35:08,338
Master,

755
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:10,499
I-I couldn't control it.

756
00:35:10,778 --> 00:35:11,738
Your speed is fast.

757
00:35:11,818 --> 00:35:12,899
You need to learn how to control it.

758
00:35:15,818 --> 00:35:16,738
You all continue practicing.

759
00:35:16,738 --> 00:35:17,338
Yes.

760
00:35:23,419 --> 00:35:25,658
The sword moves forward,
while power lies in the heart.

761
00:35:25,859 --> 00:35:26,499
Yes.

762
00:35:28,099 --> 00:35:28,738
Brother,

763
00:35:28,939 --> 00:35:30,138
why did they assign us

764
00:35:30,138 --> 00:35:31,658
to Master Cold Blood?

765
00:35:32,258 --> 00:35:33,499
Whenever I see her face,

766
00:35:33,499 --> 00:35:34,499
I don't want to practice.

767
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:36,459
There's nothing special

768
00:35:36,459 --> 00:35:37,859
about what Changfeng Academy teaches.

769
00:35:38,499 --> 00:35:39,258
Well,

770
00:35:39,379 --> 00:35:40,459
is it because Dean

771
00:35:40,459 --> 00:35:41,939
has some unique techniques,

772
00:35:42,059 --> 00:35:43,138
like his move,

773
00:35:43,178 --> 00:35:45,059
True Meaning of Void Cleavage,

774
00:35:45,338 --> 00:35:46,658
and he wants to keep it for himself,

775
00:35:46,658 --> 00:35:47,818
not teach it to us?

776
00:35:50,818 --> 00:35:52,459
Can you stop talking nonsense?

777
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:53,419
Practice seriously.

778
00:35:53,618 --> 00:35:54,698
With your current level,

779
00:35:54,859 --> 00:35:55,419
even if they taught you

780
00:35:55,419 --> 00:35:56,618
more advanced spells,

781
00:35:56,738 --> 00:35:57,899
you wouldn't be able to learn them?

782
00:35:58,059 --> 00:35:59,258
How come I wouldn't be able to?

783
00:35:59,658 --> 00:36:01,618
Although I'm not as good as you,

784
00:36:01,899 --> 00:36:03,298
I'm much better than

785
00:36:03,419 --> 00:36:05,539
Puyang Bo, Kong Hao, and Mo Zhu,

786
00:36:05,539 --> 00:36:06,379
aren't I?

787
00:36:06,698 --> 00:36:08,338
Studying with those trashes

788
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:09,698
makes me embarrassed.

789
00:36:09,939 --> 00:36:10,698
Well,

790
00:36:10,818 --> 00:36:11,979
as we've already known

791
00:36:11,979 --> 00:36:13,258
these things,

792
00:36:13,459 --> 00:36:15,099
why are you still
practicing so seriously?

793
00:36:15,099 --> 00:36:15,698
You.

794
00:36:16,099 --> 00:36:17,178
You what?

795
00:36:19,539 --> 00:36:20,459
Si Borong.

796
00:36:23,059 --> 00:36:23,979
Ms. Tanshi.

797
00:36:24,138 --> 00:36:25,258
What can I do for you, Ms. Tanshi?

798
00:36:25,459 --> 00:36:27,298
Show me what you just learned.

799
00:36:27,778 --> 00:36:29,298
Yes, as you command.

800
00:36:56,618 --> 00:36:58,778
Ms. Tanshi,

801
00:36:58,818 --> 00:36:59,939
what do you think?

802
00:37:00,099 --> 00:37:01,618
Since you performed a good show,

803
00:37:01,818 --> 00:37:03,138
I'll reward you

804
00:37:04,019 --> 00:37:06,099
keep smiling for three hours.

805
00:37:07,698 --> 00:37:08,899
Slacking off in class.

806
00:37:09,059 --> 00:37:10,338
Not serious at all.

807
00:37:11,218 --> 00:37:12,579
Since you love smiling so much,

808
00:37:12,778 --> 00:37:13,899
today I'll let you smile enough.

809
00:37:14,379 --> 00:37:16,019
Anyone who wants to be like him

810
00:37:16,178 --> 00:37:17,138
may step forward now.

811
00:37:32,499 --> 00:37:33,419
I'm so smart.

812
00:37:33,419 --> 00:37:34,698
Secretly brought

813
00:37:34,698 --> 00:37:35,618
these delicacies from home.

814
00:37:35,618 --> 00:37:37,379
After my second processing,

815
00:37:37,539 --> 00:37:39,419
they look, smell, and taste good.

816
00:37:39,539 --> 00:37:40,658
Xueying will definitely

817
00:37:40,658 --> 00:37:41,859
look at me with admiration.

818
00:37:46,218 --> 00:37:48,338
Master Tanshi is so cruel.

819
00:37:48,499 --> 00:37:49,818
Her heart harder than stone.

820
00:37:50,818 --> 00:37:52,899
You should avoid her in the future.

821
00:37:53,099 --> 00:37:54,459
Provoke her less.

822
00:37:54,459 --> 00:37:55,778
Why should I avoid her?

823
00:37:55,939 --> 00:37:56,778
Why should I be afraid of her?

824
00:37:56,778 --> 00:37:57,778
Let me massage it for you.

825
00:37:57,939 --> 00:37:59,258
- Massage, massage.
- Go away, go away.

826
00:38:00,658 --> 00:38:02,298
Try my Soothing Seal

827
00:38:02,419 --> 00:38:03,459
to see if it works.

828
00:38:04,019 --> 00:38:05,258
How about it? Here you are.

829
00:38:09,178 --> 00:38:10,979
How is it? Does it work?

830
00:38:11,818 --> 00:38:13,698
What's the use of this thing?

831
00:38:13,698 --> 00:38:14,459
Wait, wait, wait.

832
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:15,939
Don't worry, try one more.

833
00:38:20,658 --> 00:38:21,778
What is this?

834
00:38:21,778 --> 00:38:22,459
Take it away, take it away.

835
00:38:24,099 --> 00:38:26,099
Don't people say not to hit his face
when beating someone?

836
00:38:26,099 --> 00:38:27,298
What kind of mistake did you make

837
00:38:27,298 --> 00:38:28,499
to have your face beaten like this?

838
00:38:28,658 --> 00:38:29,579
Puyang Bo, you...

839
00:38:29,579 --> 00:38:30,818
Let me tell it, let me tell it.

840
00:38:30,979 --> 00:38:31,658
Borong

841
00:38:31,658 --> 00:38:33,419
angered Master Tanshi.

842
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,539
Master Tanshi

843
00:38:34,539 --> 00:38:36,298
punished him to smile for three hours,

844
00:38:36,459 --> 00:38:38,379
so his mouth is crooked from smiling.

845
00:38:38,379 --> 00:38:39,859
What a special punishment, huh?

846
00:38:40,138 --> 00:38:41,539
Come, Borong.

847
00:38:41,658 --> 00:38:43,019
Let me have a look.

848
00:38:46,979 --> 00:38:48,298
What do you mean?

849
00:38:48,298 --> 00:38:49,419
Imitating me?

850
00:38:49,419 --> 00:38:50,178
Stop right there.

851
00:38:50,738 --> 00:38:51,658
I'll hit you.

852
00:38:52,099 --> 00:38:52,539
Stop right there.

853
00:38:52,539 --> 00:38:53,539
I can't stand it.

854
00:38:54,258 --> 00:38:55,258
Forget it, forget it.

855
00:38:55,258 --> 00:38:55,738
Don't run.

856
00:38:55,738 --> 00:38:56,778
You can't catch up with me.

857
00:38:57,499 --> 00:38:58,338
- You.
- Be careful.

858
00:38:59,258 --> 00:39:00,178
Miss Youyue.

859
00:39:00,499 --> 00:39:02,499
Sister, why are you here?

860
00:39:02,778 --> 00:39:03,499
Miss Youyue,

861
00:39:03,618 --> 00:39:05,138
what delicious food did you bring today?

862
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,338
Where's Xueying?

863
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:12,218
Xueying hasn't returned yet.

864
00:39:12,298 --> 00:39:13,859
He might be at the Practice Field.

865
00:39:15,379 --> 00:39:16,618
Then I'll leave now.

866
00:39:17,419 --> 00:39:18,338
Miss Youyue,

867
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:21,059
don't be in such a hurry to leave.

868
00:39:21,178 --> 00:39:22,499
So, your things

869
00:39:22,539 --> 00:39:23,859
are meant for Dongbo Xueying

870
00:39:23,859 --> 00:39:24,579
himself.

871
00:39:25,019 --> 00:39:27,459
Usually, the one
who gets in the way is either a ruffian

872
00:39:28,019 --> 00:39:29,258
or Yama.

873
00:39:29,499 --> 00:39:30,738
May I ask who you are?

874
00:39:30,899 --> 00:39:32,178
I...

875
00:39:35,419 --> 00:39:36,539
I just want to

876
00:39:36,698 --> 00:39:38,138
talk more with you.

877
00:39:39,698 --> 00:39:40,459
Listen,

878
00:39:40,618 --> 00:39:41,379
it's better not to

879
00:39:41,379 --> 00:39:42,419
get close to my sister.

880
00:39:43,539 --> 00:39:44,618
I can't get close to anyone

881
00:39:44,618 --> 00:39:45,778
in Changfeng Academy?

882
00:39:45,979 --> 00:39:46,859
As I can't get close to teachers,

883
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:47,939
can't I get close to my classmates?

884
00:39:48,859 --> 00:39:50,019
Alright, alright.

885
00:39:52,338 --> 00:39:53,499
Come, come and have a seat.

886
00:39:53,499 --> 00:39:55,698
(This Kong Youyue is interesting.)

887
00:39:55,899 --> 00:39:57,778
(She is bold.)

888
00:39:58,298 --> 00:40:00,138
(But I like it.)

889
00:40:14,298 --> 00:40:15,019
Xueying.

890
00:40:15,419 --> 00:40:16,658
I'll accompany you for a few moves.

891
00:40:17,059 --> 00:40:17,658
Okay.

892
00:40:24,019 --> 00:40:25,459
The spear is not only in your hands

893
00:40:25,658 --> 00:40:26,698
but also in your heart.

894
00:40:27,419 --> 00:40:28,218
Actually,

895
00:40:28,419 --> 00:40:29,419
you should try

896
00:40:29,618 --> 00:40:30,899
not to think about the formulations.

897
00:40:31,258 --> 00:40:32,218
Focus

898
00:40:32,379 --> 00:40:33,178
on how your body

899
00:40:33,178 --> 00:40:34,178
feels right now instead.

900
00:40:43,979 --> 00:40:44,939
After you forget the formulations,

901
00:40:45,138 --> 00:40:46,218
indeed, you can
control yourself at will.

902
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,218
Don't be restrained by the formulations.

903
00:40:48,459 --> 00:40:50,019
Follow your heart when using the spear.

904
00:40:50,099 --> 00:40:51,939
Only then can you achieve unity

905
00:40:52,059 --> 00:40:53,338
between the spear and yourself

906
00:40:53,459 --> 00:40:54,419
and unleash
the greatest power of the spear.

907
00:40:55,258 --> 00:40:56,499
Thank you, Mr. Situ, for your guidance.

908
00:40:56,939 --> 00:40:58,218
I wouldn't call it guidance.

909
00:40:58,618 --> 00:40:59,778
I've been practicing martial arts
since I was young.

910
00:40:59,979 --> 00:41:00,859
So for some things,

911
00:41:01,019 --> 00:41:02,579
I just understood earlier than you.

912
00:41:02,818 --> 00:41:03,419
Yes.

913
00:41:04,059 --> 00:41:04,698
I'm already very grateful

914
00:41:04,698 --> 00:41:05,859
that you shared

915
00:41:05,939 --> 00:41:07,218
this valuable experience with me.

916
00:41:07,579 --> 00:41:08,579
I just don't want

917
00:41:08,579 --> 00:41:10,258
someone to miss dinner

918
00:41:10,899 --> 00:41:12,019
because of martial arts practice.

919
00:41:13,459 --> 00:41:14,859
Puyang Bo asked me to give this to you.

920
00:41:16,059 --> 00:41:17,059
Why didn't he come?

921
00:41:17,338 --> 00:41:18,459
He said

922
00:41:18,459 --> 00:41:19,539
that after having a full meal,

923
00:41:19,738 --> 00:41:20,979
one should go to sleep quickly.

924
00:41:21,459 --> 00:41:22,618
That's his style for sure.

925
00:41:28,939 --> 00:41:31,258
You eat quite fast.

926
00:41:31,539 --> 00:41:33,338
Finish it and continue training sooner.

927
00:41:34,778 --> 00:41:35,419
Come on.

928
00:41:36,298 --> 00:41:37,138
Practice with me.

929
00:41:38,818 --> 00:41:39,698
It's a deal.

930
00:41:39,899 --> 00:41:40,778
It's a deal.
