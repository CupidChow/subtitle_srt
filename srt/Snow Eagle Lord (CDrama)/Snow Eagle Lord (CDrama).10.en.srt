Ruined?

23
00:01:49,795 --> 00:01:50,914
Sorry, I couldn't make it.

24
00:01:52,075 --> 00:01:52,675
Second Priest,

25
00:01:53,235 --> 00:01:54,675
you could punish me.

26
00:01:54,875 --> 00:01:56,595
I've always treated you well.

27
00:01:56,914 --> 00:01:58,235
Now, such an important matter

28
00:01:58,235 --> 00:01:59,194
is messed up by you.

29
00:01:59,194 --> 00:02:00,114
Tell me.

30
00:02:00,715 --> 00:02:01,994
How should I punish you?

31
00:02:02,194 --> 00:02:03,474
Second Priest, please calm down.

32
00:02:04,515 --> 00:02:05,675
Actually, it's not that

33
00:02:05,675 --> 00:02:06,955
there is no other way.

34
00:02:08,234 --> 00:02:08,914
Say it.

35
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,035
Kong's Weapon Shop

36
00:02:11,155 --> 00:02:12,155
is the largest weapon shop

37
00:02:12,155 --> 00:02:13,514
in Dragon Mountain Empire.

38
00:02:13,835 --> 00:02:14,715
Their business

39
00:02:14,715 --> 00:02:15,715
is very successful.

40
00:02:15,995 --> 00:02:17,275
Perhaps at their shop,

41
00:02:17,634 --> 00:02:19,875
there are Bloodshed Weapons.

42
00:02:20,074 --> 00:02:21,194
I'll give you three days.

43
00:02:22,234 --> 00:02:23,194
Otherwise...

44
00:02:23,794 --> 00:02:25,474
You know what you will get.

45
00:02:25,555 --> 00:02:26,275
Yes.

46
00:02:27,384 --> 00:02:29,080
(Kong's Weapon Workshop)

47
00:02:32,875 --> 00:02:33,954
Your Lordship,

48
00:02:34,275 --> 00:02:36,074
what brings you here?

49
00:02:36,595 --> 00:02:38,634
Mr. Kong, you seem quite pleased.

50
00:02:38,875 --> 00:02:39,754
It seems that

51
00:02:39,995 --> 00:02:41,835
your business must be doing well.

52
00:02:42,794 --> 00:02:43,875
No, no.

53
00:02:43,914 --> 00:02:45,715
I still need Your Lordship

54
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:46,715
to take care of me.

55
00:02:47,555 --> 00:02:48,555
This time, Your Lordship,

56
00:02:48,875 --> 00:02:50,395
what a deal do you want to make?

57
00:02:50,555 --> 00:02:52,835
It's said that Kong's Weapon Shop

58
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:55,674
is the largest and most complete
in Dragon Mountain Empire.

59
00:02:56,354 --> 00:02:58,354
We can find
all kinds of weapons and treasures here.

60
00:03:00,074 --> 00:03:01,954
That's not false.

61
00:03:02,474 --> 00:03:04,794
For what weapons Your Lordship wants,

62
00:03:04,914 --> 00:03:06,914
if my shop doesn't have them,

63
00:03:07,514 --> 00:03:09,514
I'm afraid there's no such things

64
00:03:09,715 --> 00:03:11,395
in the entire Dragon Mountain Empire.

65
00:03:12,395 --> 00:03:13,234
Mr. Kong,

66
00:03:14,634 --> 00:03:16,035
I want something special.

67
00:03:19,634 --> 00:03:21,555
Can we talk privately?

68
00:03:25,234 --> 00:03:26,514
There's no one around.

69
00:03:27,315 --> 00:03:29,074
I'll just get straight to the point.

70
00:03:29,595 --> 00:03:30,474
Mr. Kong,

71
00:03:31,275 --> 00:03:32,395
have you heard of

72
00:03:32,754 --> 00:03:34,474
Bloodshed Weapons?

73
00:03:36,954 --> 00:03:38,234
This weapon.

74
00:03:39,275 --> 00:03:41,435
I think Kong's Weapon Shop

75
00:03:41,674 --> 00:03:43,395
is not the treasure box as it is said.

76
00:03:43,514 --> 00:03:44,954
I just came here to try my luck.

77
00:03:45,194 --> 00:03:46,074
If you have it,

78
00:03:46,914 --> 00:03:48,674
it would be a fortune-making opportunity

79
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:50,275
for Mr. Kong.

80
00:03:50,555 --> 00:03:51,555
If not,

81
00:03:52,275 --> 00:03:53,435
we can stop now.

82
00:03:54,794 --> 00:03:56,395
I'll save these 100,000 taels of gold

83
00:03:56,514 --> 00:03:58,474
and try my luck with someone else.

84
00:03:58,555 --> 00:04:00,234
100,000 taels of gold.

85
00:04:04,194 --> 00:04:05,354
I knew

86
00:04:06,074 --> 00:04:08,315
coming to Mr. Kong was the right choice.

87
00:04:09,435 --> 00:04:11,794
Though Your Lordship is wealthy,

88
00:04:12,115 --> 00:04:14,035
these Bloodshed Weapons,

89
00:04:14,634 --> 00:04:16,474
from the materials to refining

90
00:04:16,835 --> 00:04:18,595
are rare and precious.

91
00:04:18,755 --> 00:04:20,794
Moreover, their destructive power

92
00:04:20,914 --> 00:04:22,275
is obvious.

93
00:04:23,075 --> 00:04:23,914
So...

94
00:04:23,914 --> 00:04:24,674
Mr. Kong,

95
00:04:25,234 --> 00:04:26,674
as long as you have them,

96
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:28,195
the price is up to you.

97
00:04:31,715 --> 00:04:32,794
How many pieces do you want?

98
00:04:32,914 --> 00:04:33,794
Ten.

99
00:04:33,835 --> 00:04:34,314
Ten...

100
00:04:34,554 --> 00:04:35,835
Ten pieces?

101
00:04:37,515 --> 00:04:38,434
Your Lordship.

102
00:04:38,434 --> 00:04:40,114
Are you joking?

103
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:42,275
You can't find

104
00:04:42,354 --> 00:04:44,114
ten Bloodshed Weapons

105
00:04:44,114 --> 00:04:45,794
in the entire Dragon Mountain Empire.

106
00:04:46,474 --> 00:04:48,554
What's more, ordinary weapon shops

107
00:04:48,554 --> 00:04:50,794
won't have such things.

108
00:04:50,914 --> 00:04:51,794
You know that.

109
00:04:52,035 --> 00:04:52,635
This...

110
00:04:53,314 --> 00:04:54,035
is not

111
00:04:54,035 --> 00:04:55,354
an ordinary weapon.

112
00:04:55,874 --> 00:04:57,114
It can harm

113
00:04:57,114 --> 00:04:58,554
Transcendents.

114
00:04:58,914 --> 00:05:00,835
For such a high-level and powerful

115
00:05:00,835 --> 00:05:02,234
alchemy weapon,

116
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:03,715
how could you want it so easily

117
00:05:03,715 --> 00:05:04,635
as your Lordship said?

118
00:05:04,635 --> 00:05:07,114
Ten pieces at one time.

119
00:05:07,314 --> 00:05:09,035
Mr. Kong, stop beating around the bush.

120
00:05:09,515 --> 00:05:10,794
Do you have them or not?

121
00:05:11,515 --> 00:05:12,354
If not,

122
00:05:12,354 --> 00:05:13,314
then this money

123
00:05:13,595 --> 00:05:15,354
will have to be earned by someone else.

124
00:05:15,474 --> 00:05:16,474
Yes,

125
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:17,794
I do have.

126
00:05:18,354 --> 00:05:19,234
However,

127
00:05:19,874 --> 00:05:20,994
Your Lordship,

128
00:05:21,755 --> 00:05:23,635
why do you need so many

129
00:05:23,994 --> 00:05:25,395
Bloodshed Weapons?

130
00:05:25,515 --> 00:05:26,715
That's not something

131
00:05:26,715 --> 00:05:27,955
you should be concerned about.

132
00:05:28,595 --> 00:05:30,635
Do I have to report

133
00:05:31,474 --> 00:05:33,354
even Moyang Fort's business to you?

134
00:05:33,994 --> 00:05:34,994
Not at all.

135
00:05:35,114 --> 00:05:35,874
I dare not.

136
00:05:36,195 --> 00:05:36,835
Mr. Kong,

137
00:05:37,354 --> 00:05:38,434
you're a businessman.

138
00:05:38,835 --> 00:05:40,314
We'll pay

139
00:05:40,314 --> 00:05:41,434
as you deliver the goods.

140
00:05:41,434 --> 00:05:42,835
As long as we finish the deal,

141
00:05:43,234 --> 00:05:45,554
you don't need to know the rest.

142
00:05:47,395 --> 00:05:48,914
200,000 taels of gold.

143
00:05:49,155 --> 00:05:50,075
Deal.

144
00:05:50,434 --> 00:05:51,314
What I meant

145
00:05:51,515 --> 00:05:53,434
is 200,000 taels per piece.

146
00:05:58,354 --> 00:05:59,314
Mr. Kong.

147
00:06:00,314 --> 00:06:01,554
You really know

148
00:06:01,715 --> 00:06:02,994
how to do business.

149
00:06:03,275 --> 00:06:04,234
There's a reason

150
00:06:04,234 --> 00:06:05,314
why your business is so big.

151
00:06:05,515 --> 00:06:06,474
Your Lordship,

152
00:06:06,715 --> 00:06:08,035
I'm flattered.

153
00:06:08,114 --> 00:06:09,955
How many pieces do you have on earth?

154
00:06:14,234 --> 00:06:15,794
I want them today.

155
00:06:16,994 --> 00:06:18,114
No problem.

156
00:06:20,554 --> 00:06:21,914
At 17:45,

157
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,755
someone will come to pick up the goods

158
00:06:23,755 --> 00:06:24,635
with the other half.

159
00:06:25,794 --> 00:06:26,635
Mr. Kong,

160
00:06:26,914 --> 00:06:28,035
don't fool me around.

161
00:06:28,434 --> 00:06:29,114
Otherwise,

162
00:06:29,114 --> 00:06:30,434
it won't be as easy as

163
00:06:30,434 --> 00:06:31,794
returning the money.

164
00:06:33,155 --> 00:06:34,314
Please rest assured.

165
00:06:43,035 --> 00:06:44,314
They are already packed and waiting

166
00:06:44,314 --> 00:06:45,395
at Kong's Weapon Workshop.

167
00:06:46,395 --> 00:06:48,114
You could just
send someone to pick them up.

168
00:06:49,354 --> 00:06:49,994
However,

169
00:06:50,554 --> 00:06:51,715
there are only four pieces.

170
00:06:52,275 --> 00:06:53,715
This is already the highest number

171
00:06:53,715 --> 00:06:54,395
of Bloodshed Weapons I can find

172
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:56,835
in such a short time.

173
00:07:01,395 --> 00:07:02,354
Train well.

174
00:07:05,914 --> 00:07:07,075
Thank you, Second Priest.

175
00:07:08,275 --> 00:07:09,554
Greetings, High Priest.

176
00:07:13,035 --> 00:07:14,994
It is the secret tunnel map of Fog City.

177
00:07:15,515 --> 00:07:16,674
Prepare well.

178
00:07:18,794 --> 00:07:20,515
But the sisters of Fog City

179
00:07:20,515 --> 00:07:22,395
are best at
their signature Double Fans Duo.

180
00:07:23,155 --> 00:07:24,874
Few people in the world can rival them.

181
00:07:24,874 --> 00:07:25,674
No worries.

182
00:07:25,955 --> 00:07:27,035
Xiaoxi and Qiubai

183
00:07:27,035 --> 00:07:28,474
will go to the orphanage tomorrow.

184
00:07:28,635 --> 00:07:30,474
So, only Chunyuan will be in the city.

185
00:07:30,474 --> 00:07:32,715
It's the perfect time to attack.

186
00:07:33,595 --> 00:07:34,874
High Priest is indeed wise.

187
00:07:35,554 --> 00:07:37,354
Are the Bloodshed Weapons ready?

188
00:07:45,354 --> 00:07:46,234
They're all here.

189
00:07:46,635 --> 00:07:47,955
Only four pieces.

190
00:07:48,114 --> 00:07:49,275
But I have the ability

191
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:51,595
to increase their power tenfold,

192
00:07:52,114 --> 00:07:53,114
even a hundredfold.

193
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:40,760
(Orphanage)

194
00:08:41,674 --> 00:08:42,834
You can't catch me.

195
00:08:44,155 --> 00:08:45,554
Hurry up, hurry up.

196
00:08:45,995 --> 00:08:47,914
Hurry up, hurry up.

197
00:08:48,074 --> 00:08:49,074
I want you to catch it.

198
00:08:49,074 --> 00:08:49,875
Hurry up, hurry up.

199
00:08:50,035 --> 00:08:51,194
Run now, run now. Run.

200
00:08:51,194 --> 00:08:51,834
Feng.

201
00:08:52,275 --> 00:08:52,954
Hu.

202
00:08:53,554 --> 00:08:55,834
Brother Changfeng and Sister Xiaoxi.

203
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:57,834
Brother Changfeng, Brother Changfeng.

204
00:08:57,834 --> 00:08:58,954
You're here.

205
00:08:59,875 --> 00:09:01,635
We've been waiting for you
for a long time.

206
00:09:02,914 --> 00:09:04,475
Ms. Qin said

207
00:09:04,475 --> 00:09:07,434
you would definitely come today.

208
00:09:07,434 --> 00:09:08,155
You will come.

209
00:09:08,155 --> 00:09:09,834
Yes, definitely come.

210
00:09:10,834 --> 00:09:11,355
Have you been

211
00:09:11,355 --> 00:09:12,515
listening to the teachers recently?

212
00:09:12,515 --> 00:09:14,074
Yes.

213
00:09:14,074 --> 00:09:14,714
Are you well-behaved?

214
00:09:14,875 --> 00:09:16,515
Yes.

215
00:09:16,515 --> 00:09:17,914
Only good kids get candy.

216
00:09:18,074 --> 00:09:19,995
Okay.

217
00:09:20,235 --> 00:09:21,235
I brought you some delicious food.

218
00:09:21,235 --> 00:09:22,515
I want candy too.

219
00:09:22,515 --> 00:09:23,355
Me too.

220
00:09:23,355 --> 00:09:23,875
Here.

221
00:09:25,074 --> 00:09:25,954
Me too, me too.

222
00:09:26,674 --> 00:09:27,515
One by one.

223
00:09:27,515 --> 00:09:28,434
Give me one.

224
00:09:28,434 --> 00:09:29,794
Thank you, sister.

225
00:09:30,355 --> 00:09:30,554
Here, yours.

226
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:32,954
Thank you, sister. Thank you, sister.

227
00:09:33,144 --> 00:09:35,640
(Fog City)

228
00:10:10,515 --> 00:10:11,834
High Priest meant this place.

229
00:10:12,275 --> 00:10:13,035
Open the door.

230
00:10:13,035 --> 00:10:13,434
Yes.

231
00:10:43,115 --> 00:10:44,235
Don't try to take away

232
00:10:44,235 --> 00:10:45,875
a single source stone from Fog City.

233
00:10:50,395 --> 00:10:51,515
Take her down.

234
00:11:17,554 --> 00:11:21,554
Sister Xiaoxi, Brother Changfeng.

235
00:11:21,554 --> 00:11:23,635
Goodbye.

236
00:11:23,635 --> 00:11:24,074
Goodbye.

237
00:11:24,074 --> 00:11:25,995
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

238
00:11:25,995 --> 00:11:27,074
Next time we'll come together

239
00:11:27,074 --> 00:11:27,834
to see you again.

240
00:11:27,834 --> 00:11:29,834
You must come to see us.

241
00:11:29,914 --> 00:11:32,074
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

242
00:11:32,395 --> 00:11:33,194
Goodbye.

243
00:11:35,395 --> 00:11:36,554
I'll take these chestnut cakes

244
00:11:36,554 --> 00:11:37,594
back to Chunyuan.

245
00:11:37,674 --> 00:11:38,954
She loves sweets the most.

246
00:11:40,194 --> 00:11:41,515
I'll go to the Council

247
00:11:41,674 --> 00:11:42,594
to report on how the disciples

248
00:11:42,594 --> 00:11:43,714
are searching for the Demon Clan.

249
00:11:43,834 --> 00:11:44,875
I'll be back soon.

250
00:11:45,074 --> 00:11:46,035
Recently, the matter of the Demon Clan

251
00:11:46,035 --> 00:11:47,434
has taken a lot of your effort.

252
00:11:47,554 --> 00:11:48,475
Go back and rest early.

253
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,314
I never feel tired

254
00:11:50,314 --> 00:11:51,714
when being with you.

255
00:11:52,235 --> 00:11:53,074
Me too.

256
00:11:53,275 --> 00:11:54,395
If I am free tomorrow,

257
00:11:54,395 --> 00:11:55,035
I'll go to the academy

258
00:11:55,035 --> 00:11:56,074
and teach the disciples.

259
00:11:56,554 --> 00:11:57,155
Alright.

260
00:11:57,395 --> 00:11:57,914
I'll have the kitchen

261
00:11:57,914 --> 00:11:58,914
prepare some delicious food for you.

262
00:12:02,635 --> 00:12:03,275
Xiaoxi.

263
00:12:03,794 --> 00:12:04,635
What's wrong?

264
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:29,115
Chunyuan,

265
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:30,074
I brought you

266
00:12:30,074 --> 00:12:31,554
your favorite snack.

267
00:12:39,914 --> 00:12:41,275
(Forbidden Zone of Source Stones.)

268
00:12:45,035 --> 00:12:46,115
You don't have to wait.

269
00:12:46,594 --> 00:12:48,194
Xiaoxi won't be coming back.

270
00:12:48,314 --> 00:12:49,115
Besides,

271
00:12:49,434 --> 00:12:50,074
she's not in Fog City

272
00:12:50,074 --> 00:12:51,074
these days.

273
00:12:51,155 --> 00:12:52,714
I can wait for her to come back.

274
00:12:56,674 --> 00:12:57,395
Chunyuan.

275
00:12:59,074 --> 00:13:00,594
Xiaoxi, better leave now.

276
00:13:00,674 --> 00:13:01,794
Master Bu.

277
00:13:02,035 --> 00:13:03,674
I knew you would come.

278
00:13:03,674 --> 00:13:04,515
Let her go.

279
00:13:04,755 --> 00:13:05,515
Sure.

280
00:13:05,914 --> 00:13:06,635
But you have to give me

281
00:13:06,635 --> 00:13:07,954
what I want.

282
00:13:08,275 --> 00:13:09,275
Fog City

283
00:13:09,714 --> 00:13:11,115
will never make deals
with the Demon Clan.

284
00:13:11,235 --> 00:13:12,834
It seems you don't care

285
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:14,594
about your sister's life, Master Bu.

286
00:13:14,714 --> 00:13:15,395
Stop it.

287
00:13:15,954 --> 00:13:17,875
Hand over all the source stones to me.

288
00:13:18,355 --> 00:13:19,194
Xiaoxi.

289
00:13:19,954 --> 00:13:20,834
Don't worry about me.

290
00:13:21,355 --> 00:13:22,594
There are plenty of source stones.

291
00:13:23,035 --> 00:13:24,554
But you only have one sister.

292
00:13:30,794 --> 00:13:31,554
Fine.

293
00:13:33,115 --> 00:13:33,834
I'll give them to you.

294
00:13:34,594 --> 00:13:35,395
But

295
00:13:36,035 --> 00:13:37,395
you have to release Chunyuan first.

296
00:13:38,194 --> 00:13:39,834
Only when we do Double Fans

297
00:13:40,194 --> 00:13:41,834
can we open
Forbidden Zone of Source Stones.

298
00:13:50,155 --> 00:13:51,914
Don't try any tricks.

299
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:53,794
Even if you save your sister,

300
00:13:53,914 --> 00:13:55,834
think about the civilians of Fog City.

301
00:13:56,115 --> 00:13:56,794
I've installed many devices

302
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:58,275
all over the place.

303
00:13:58,395 --> 00:13:59,914
As soon as I give the order,

304
00:14:00,235 --> 00:14:01,194
no one will survive

305
00:14:01,194 --> 00:14:02,355
for over half an hour.

306
00:14:03,714 --> 00:14:04,554
Despicable.

307
00:14:04,714 --> 00:14:05,875
I will count to three.

308
00:14:07,275 --> 00:14:08,115
One.

309
00:14:11,194 --> 00:14:11,914
Two.

310
00:14:13,995 --> 00:14:14,794
Three.

311
00:14:15,074 --> 00:14:15,794
I'll give it to you.

312
00:14:16,515 --> 00:14:17,395
Xiaoxi.

313
00:14:20,954 --> 00:14:22,714
Let's open the Forbidden Zone.

314
00:14:26,995 --> 00:14:28,275
(When I say "go",)

315
00:14:28,714 --> 00:14:30,434
(you leave at the fastest speed)

316
00:14:30,434 --> 00:14:31,635
(and destroy his devices.)

317
00:14:31,794 --> 00:14:32,554
(What are you going to do?)

318
00:14:32,554 --> 00:14:33,475
(Do as I say.)

319
00:14:33,475 --> 00:14:34,554
Don't dilly-dally.

320
00:14:34,995 --> 00:14:36,194
Hurry up and open it.

321
00:14:50,720 --> 00:14:52,216
(True Meaning of Fluctuation)

322
00:15:17,074 --> 00:15:18,475
So many source stones.

323
00:15:18,834 --> 00:15:20,554
I'll take them all away today.

324
00:15:20,834 --> 00:15:21,674
(Chunyuan.)

325
00:15:22,074 --> 00:15:23,635
(From now on, everything is up to you.)

326
00:15:23,834 --> 00:15:25,314
(No. Let's go together.)

327
00:15:25,395 --> 00:15:26,875
(Guard Fog City.)

328
00:16:01,275 --> 00:16:02,714
(Even if I'm not here in the future,)

329
00:16:03,155 --> 00:16:04,834
(Fog City will still be)

330
00:16:04,834 --> 00:16:06,074
(your strongest support.)

331
00:16:06,074 --> 00:16:07,475
No matter if Fog City exists or not,

332
00:16:09,155 --> 00:16:10,314
I only want you.

333
00:16:46,314 --> 00:16:47,794
The despicable plan of the Demon Clan

334
00:16:48,074 --> 00:16:49,235
will never succeed.

335
00:16:51,314 --> 00:16:52,515
Since you siblings

336
00:16:52,515 --> 00:16:53,755
gave me a hard time.

337
00:16:54,875 --> 00:16:56,475
Then I'll let you die with me.

338
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,715
(So there are source stones
in the Sea God Palace.)

339
00:17:44,794 --> 00:17:45,995
How is Ms. Xiaoxi?

340
00:17:46,114 --> 00:17:47,275
Her condition isn't good.

341
00:17:47,394 --> 00:17:48,114
Knight Changfeng

342
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,275
is with her inside.

343
00:17:53,035 --> 00:17:53,634
Master.

344
00:17:54,594 --> 00:17:55,475
We'll help you save her.

345
00:18:04,675 --> 00:18:05,675
Qiubai.

346
00:18:08,275 --> 00:18:09,435
Don't try anymore.

347
00:18:12,794 --> 00:18:13,554
Xiaoxi.

348
00:18:15,634 --> 00:18:16,475
Xiaoxi.

349
00:18:17,114 --> 00:18:18,794
Don't hurt yourself anymore.

350
00:18:20,475 --> 00:18:22,195
I know my own body.

351
00:18:22,794 --> 00:18:24,515
Now listen carefully.

352
00:18:25,794 --> 00:18:28,675
Sacrificing your cultivation
to save me at this time

353
00:18:29,074 --> 00:18:30,715
is not a wise move.

354
00:18:31,515 --> 00:18:32,515
Qiubai,

355
00:18:34,114 --> 00:18:35,275
as for Chunyuan,

356
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,755
I will leave her to you.

357
00:18:38,035 --> 00:18:38,834
Xiaoxi.

358
00:18:39,475 --> 00:18:40,834
You'll be fine.

359
00:18:41,195 --> 00:18:42,515
You'll get better.

360
00:18:49,675 --> 00:18:50,515
From now on,

361
00:18:51,755 --> 00:18:52,755
I'll leave Dragon Mountain Empire

362
00:18:53,275 --> 00:18:54,675
to you all.

363
00:19:17,074 --> 00:19:17,794
Xiaoxi.

364
00:19:18,715 --> 00:19:19,515
Xiaoxi.

365
00:19:23,195 --> 00:19:24,634
Xiaoxi.

366
00:19:28,475 --> 00:19:30,275
If only I could become a star.

367
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:32,354
That way, no matter when

368
00:19:32,554 --> 00:19:33,794
you looked up,

369
00:19:33,955 --> 00:19:35,114
you could see me.

370
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,035
We could always be like this,

371
00:19:37,035 --> 00:19:38,074
watching each other.

372
00:19:38,715 --> 00:19:39,275
I don't want you

373
00:19:39,275 --> 00:19:40,475
to become a star or the moon.

374
00:19:41,154 --> 00:19:42,195
I just want us like this,

375
00:19:43,275 --> 00:19:44,475
admiring the moon

376
00:19:45,554 --> 00:19:47,314
and protecting the empire together.

377
00:19:49,794 --> 00:19:50,594
Qiubai.

378
00:19:51,435 --> 00:19:52,275
This flower

379
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:53,794
is for you.

380
00:19:56,755 --> 00:19:58,154
Do you know its meaning?

381
00:20:00,955 --> 00:20:02,114
It's protection.

382
00:20:03,715 --> 00:20:04,834
No matter where you are.

Although today

417
00:22:50,834 --> 00:22:51,834
the source stones of Fog City

418
00:22:51,834 --> 00:22:53,235
were destroyed by Bu Xiaoxi,

419
00:22:53,715 --> 00:22:55,794
when I stepped into
her sea of consciousness,

420
00:22:55,834 --> 00:22:56,794
I still discovered

421
00:22:56,794 --> 00:22:58,235
an extraordinary piece of information.

422
00:22:59,554 --> 00:23:01,394
Master Tai Shu of the Sea God Palace

423
00:23:01,634 --> 00:23:03,275
has a rare source stone.

424
00:23:03,955 --> 00:23:05,154
A tiny one

425
00:23:05,275 --> 00:23:07,235
but containing enormous energy.

426
00:23:07,354 --> 00:23:08,794
Didn't expect the Sea God Palace

427
00:23:08,794 --> 00:23:10,435
to have such a treasure.

428
00:23:10,554 --> 00:23:12,154
Now they are in deep sorrow

429
00:23:12,275 --> 00:23:13,554
in Fog City.

430
00:23:14,154 --> 00:23:14,955
Now,

431
00:23:15,354 --> 00:23:16,354
it is the perfect time

432
00:23:16,354 --> 00:23:18,314
to raid the Sea God Palace.

433
00:23:18,435 --> 00:23:19,235
Okay.

434
00:23:19,755 --> 00:23:21,995
Not only do we need to
take back the rare source stone

435
00:23:22,114 --> 00:23:24,035
but also deal a heavy blow
to the Sea God Palace

436
00:23:24,035 --> 00:23:25,955
just like Fog City,

437
00:23:26,035 --> 00:23:27,675
reducing the Xia Clan's power.

438
00:23:28,314 --> 00:23:29,675
It will be more advantageous

439
00:23:29,675 --> 00:23:30,874
to our future attacks.

440
00:23:32,554 --> 00:23:34,275
Xiaoxi used her life

441
00:23:34,515 --> 00:23:35,915
(In memory of Bu Xiaoxi, Master of Fog City)
to protect Fog City

442
00:23:36,394 --> 00:23:36,874
and maintain

443
00:23:36,874 --> 00:23:38,715
the peace of the civilians in Fog City.

444
00:24:11,074 --> 00:24:12,755
I will kill all the Demon Clan

445
00:24:13,515 --> 00:24:14,955
to avenge your death.

446
00:24:20,408 --> 00:24:22,264
(Sea God Palace)

447
00:24:24,394 --> 00:24:25,354
Kill them all.

448
00:24:25,354 --> 00:24:26,755
Get back the energy source stones.

449
00:24:26,755 --> 00:24:27,675
Kill!

450
00:24:27,675 --> 00:24:29,114
Kill!

451
00:24:41,755 --> 00:24:42,834
I can sense it.

452
00:24:43,955 --> 00:24:45,874
The Demon Clan
is attacking our Sea God Palace.

453
00:24:45,874 --> 00:24:47,554
Dare to invade our Sea God Palace.

454
00:24:47,634 --> 00:24:49,235
Let's go and kill them all together.

455
00:24:49,235 --> 00:24:50,394
If I don't avenge this,

456
00:24:51,035 --> 00:24:52,354
I swear not to be a human.

457
00:24:59,394 --> 00:25:00,354
It's the Gray Robe.

458
00:26:13,594 --> 00:26:14,235
Youyue.

459
00:26:14,235 --> 00:26:14,834
Are you alright?

460
00:26:15,554 --> 00:26:16,235
Youyue.

461
00:26:16,394 --> 00:26:17,715
Youyue, don't scare me, Youyue.

462
00:26:17,715 --> 00:26:18,314
Puyang Bo.

463
00:26:18,314 --> 00:26:20,394
Take Youyue away now. Go.

464
00:26:21,715 --> 00:26:22,475
Don't waste time.

465
00:26:22,475 --> 00:26:23,435
Take her back now.

466
00:27:54,594 --> 00:27:55,594
Dongbo Xueying.

467
00:27:55,594 --> 00:27:57,515
Why do you keep forcing me?

468
00:27:57,955 --> 00:27:59,515
Because you are a demon.

469
00:28:30,195 --> 00:28:30,955
Xueying.

470
00:28:33,554 --> 00:28:34,354
Xueying.

471
00:28:35,235 --> 00:28:36,154
- Xueying.
- Jingqiu.

472
00:28:36,154 --> 00:28:36,915
Jingqiu, danger.

473
00:28:55,715 --> 00:28:56,435
Xueying.

474
00:28:58,195 --> 00:28:59,794
Xueying.

475
00:29:00,515 --> 00:29:02,235
We'll definitely save Xueying.

476
00:29:02,794 --> 00:29:03,955
Don't worry.

477
00:29:05,515 --> 00:29:07,114
(The council values him so much.)

478
00:29:07,834 --> 00:29:08,995
(Yet he became a hero)

479
00:29:09,035 --> 00:29:09,794
(in this way.)

480
00:29:28,834 --> 00:29:30,354
Report!

481
00:29:32,314 --> 00:29:33,755
Master, something's wrong!

482
00:29:33,755 --> 00:29:35,035
The demons we killed earlier

483
00:29:35,035 --> 00:29:35,834
suddenly burst into flames.

484
00:29:35,834 --> 00:29:36,874
Burst into flames?

485
00:29:38,755 --> 00:29:39,515
What's going on?

486
00:29:39,515 --> 00:29:40,834
They were clearly already dead.

487
00:29:40,834 --> 00:29:41,794
But they came back to life
and burst into flames.

488
00:29:41,794 --> 00:29:43,515
The entire sea
has turned into a sea of fire.

489
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,275
Go back now.

490
00:29:53,354 --> 00:29:53,874
How is it?

491
00:29:55,195 --> 00:29:55,675
Master.

492
00:29:55,715 --> 00:29:56,354
Hold on.

493
00:29:56,354 --> 00:29:57,035
I'm fine.

494
00:30:06,275 --> 00:30:06,834
Okay.

495
00:30:10,675 --> 00:30:11,915
I just woke up.

496
00:30:12,235 --> 00:30:13,755
My spiritual power
hasn't fully recovered yet.

497
00:30:13,955 --> 00:30:16,074
I heard that the demons
attacked the Sea God Palace.

498
00:30:16,394 --> 00:30:17,794
So I rushed over immediately.

499
00:30:18,475 --> 00:30:19,354
Unfortunately,

500
00:30:19,554 --> 00:30:20,874
I was still one step late.

501
00:30:20,955 --> 00:30:21,675
It seems the Demon Clan

502
00:30:21,675 --> 00:30:23,235
is even more difficult
to deal with than we thought.

503
00:30:23,515 --> 00:30:24,915
If we back down this time,

504
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:27,114
today it's
the Sea God Palace that suffers.

505
00:30:27,435 --> 00:30:28,154
But tomorrow,

506
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:30,035
who knows who will be next?

507
00:30:33,435 --> 00:30:34,995
The Demon Clan actually dared to attack

508
00:30:35,035 --> 00:30:36,475
the Sea God Palace!

509
00:30:37,915 --> 00:30:39,195
If I don't repel them

510
00:30:39,195 --> 00:30:40,955
back to Dark Abyss,

511
00:30:41,915 --> 00:30:42,675
how can I face

512
00:30:42,715 --> 00:30:44,035
my dead disciples?

513
00:30:44,275 --> 00:30:45,594
The Demon Clan dared to attack

514
00:30:45,594 --> 00:30:47,915
Fog City and
the Sea God Palace in a row.

515
00:30:48,314 --> 00:30:49,235
It seems

516
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:50,794
they are really outrageous

517
00:30:51,035 --> 00:30:52,634
by their desire for the source stones.

518
00:30:53,035 --> 00:30:54,074
The Demon Clan stole

519
00:30:54,074 --> 00:30:56,035
the source stone of the Sea God Palace.

520
00:30:56,755 --> 00:30:57,915
What source stone?

521
00:31:00,235 --> 00:31:01,314
My Sea God Palace

522
00:31:01,314 --> 00:31:03,074
has a rare source stone.

523
00:31:03,594 --> 00:31:04,834
A rare source stone?

524
00:31:05,515 --> 00:31:06,475
The Sea God Palace

525
00:31:06,475 --> 00:31:07,475
has no source stones, right?

526
00:31:07,475 --> 00:31:09,554
The source stone of my Sea God Palace

527
00:31:09,995 --> 00:31:11,874
is equal to 100,000 of them.

528
00:31:16,995 --> 00:31:17,715
Tai Shu.

529
00:31:17,834 --> 00:31:19,035
Is that true?

530
00:31:19,634 --> 00:31:21,834
Does the Sea God Palace
have such a source stone?

531
00:31:21,995 --> 00:31:22,715
Of course.

532
00:31:24,874 --> 00:31:26,235
That source stone of mine

533
00:31:26,794 --> 00:31:28,354
was refined by Chunyuan and Xiaoxi

534
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:30,235
using their Double Fans.

535
00:31:52,035 --> 00:31:54,114
This rare source stone has been done.

536
00:32:06,915 --> 00:32:08,275
Master Tai Shu, please keep it safe.

537
00:32:11,634 --> 00:32:13,634
100,000 ordinary source stones

538
00:32:13,634 --> 00:32:14,915
condensed into one.

539
00:32:15,675 --> 00:32:18,314
My Sea God Palace
is far from the capital

540
00:32:18,594 --> 00:32:19,794
and lacks source stones.

541
00:32:20,195 --> 00:32:22,035
Our cultivation resources
are scarce as well.

542
00:32:22,235 --> 00:32:24,475
With this rare source stone,

543
00:32:25,275 --> 00:32:26,354
my Sea God Palace

544
00:32:26,354 --> 00:32:28,275
finally has a sense of security.

545
00:32:29,554 --> 00:32:30,955
Tell Lord Bu,

546
00:32:31,154 --> 00:32:33,594
our debts are written off.

547
00:32:34,195 --> 00:32:35,354
He sounds sour.

548
00:32:35,354 --> 00:32:36,394
What does he mean?

549
00:32:39,475 --> 00:32:40,594
What a man he is.

550
00:32:40,755 --> 00:32:42,235
We worked so hard
to make this rare source stone

551
00:32:42,275 --> 00:32:42,995
for him

552
00:32:43,074 --> 00:32:44,394
and he didn't even say thank you.

553
00:32:45,475 --> 00:32:46,394
Don't be angry.

554
00:32:46,554 --> 00:32:47,394
Master Tai Shu

555
00:32:47,475 --> 00:32:48,634
is just like that.

556
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,554
He's arrogant and rude.

557
00:32:51,794 --> 00:32:53,114
But on the other hand, Master,

558
00:32:53,394 --> 00:32:54,435
why did you agree

559
00:32:54,475 --> 00:32:55,314
to help Master Tai Shu

560
00:32:55,354 --> 00:32:56,715
refine the rare source stone?

561
00:32:57,915 --> 00:32:59,515
The spirit fans in your hands

562
00:33:00,035 --> 00:33:02,154
also have Master Tai Shu's contribution.

563
00:33:03,154 --> 00:33:04,114
I see.

564
00:33:04,435 --> 00:33:05,475
So in this case,

565
00:33:05,475 --> 00:33:06,354
not only should we help him

566
00:33:06,354 --> 00:33:07,634
refine the rare source stone,

567
00:33:07,675 --> 00:33:08,435
but we should also

568
00:33:08,435 --> 00:33:09,515
thank him in person.

569
00:33:09,874 --> 00:33:10,634
No need.

570
00:33:11,475 --> 00:33:13,195
Now the rare source stone is refined.

571
00:33:13,435 --> 00:33:15,354
What we owed to Master Tai Shu

572
00:33:15,634 --> 00:33:16,915
has paid off.

573
00:33:17,755 --> 00:33:19,235
You should also act as if

574
00:33:19,275 --> 00:33:20,354
this never

575
00:33:20,394 --> 00:33:21,235
happened.

576
00:33:21,794 --> 00:33:22,874
Master Tai Shu

577
00:33:22,874 --> 00:33:24,394
doesn't want to cause trouble

578
00:33:24,554 --> 00:33:26,515
for the Sea God Palace and himself

579
00:33:26,955 --> 00:33:28,195
because of this.

580
00:33:29,594 --> 00:33:31,834
The Demon Clan's attack
on my Sea God Palace

581
00:33:32,154 --> 00:33:33,594
was indeed aimed at

582
00:33:33,634 --> 00:33:34,874
the rare source stone.

583
00:33:36,955 --> 00:33:38,515
Fog City and the Sea God Palace

584
00:33:38,515 --> 00:33:39,874
have suffered heavy losses successively

585
00:33:40,035 --> 00:33:41,394
and we also suffered heavy casualties.

586
00:33:41,955 --> 00:33:42,834
Let's not

587
00:33:42,995 --> 00:33:44,235
cause chaos among ourselves.

588
00:33:44,515 --> 00:33:46,074
Now, suspicion and infighting

589
00:33:46,314 --> 00:33:47,475
are not good for us.

590
00:33:47,675 --> 00:33:48,755
What we need to know

591
00:33:49,195 --> 00:33:50,394
is how to destroy

592
00:33:50,515 --> 00:33:52,314
the Demon Clan's next plan.

593
00:33:52,515 --> 00:33:53,515
Just like before,

594
00:33:53,594 --> 00:33:54,675
they used the Demons

595
00:33:54,675 --> 00:33:56,554
to attack the Demon Well in Nanqin City.

596
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:57,915
It didn't open,

597
00:33:58,235 --> 00:33:58,955
but

598
00:33:59,314 --> 00:34:00,554
we later discovered that

599
00:34:00,715 --> 00:34:02,475
Lu's Fort had
a large number of source stones.

600
00:34:02,475 --> 00:34:04,275
Source stones can quickly
enhance one's cultivation

601
00:34:04,475 --> 00:34:05,715
and have great explosive power.

602
00:34:06,074 --> 00:34:07,114
But this also proves that

603
00:34:07,435 --> 00:34:08,875
the Demon Clan's power
in Dragon Mountain Empire

604
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:09,554
is insufficient,

605
00:34:09,554 --> 00:34:10,714
so they need to gather source stones

606
00:34:10,714 --> 00:34:11,674
everywhere.

607
00:34:12,154 --> 00:34:13,554
Since the Demon Clan
has already obtained

608
00:34:13,554 --> 00:34:14,634
the rare source stone,

609
00:34:14,634 --> 00:34:15,915
then their next step

610
00:34:15,915 --> 00:34:16,515
must be

611
00:34:16,515 --> 00:34:18,915
to attack
the Demon Well's barrier again.

612
00:34:18,995 --> 00:34:20,475
So now, all sects

613
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:21,795
should immediately send disciples

614
00:34:21,955 --> 00:34:22,835
to Nanqin

615
00:34:22,835 --> 00:34:23,955
to guard the Demon Well.

616
00:34:24,035 --> 00:34:24,674
Right.

617
00:34:25,355 --> 00:34:26,835
Also, we must thoroughly find out

618
00:34:27,035 --> 00:34:28,515
where the Demon Clan is hiding

619
00:34:28,515 --> 00:34:30,475
in our Dragon Mountain Empire.

620
00:34:30,634 --> 00:34:31,795
The Demon God Association has always

621
00:34:31,795 --> 00:34:33,395
been hidden in the darkness.

622
00:34:33,754 --> 00:34:35,594
As long as they don't take action,

623
00:34:35,594 --> 00:34:37,234
where can we find them?

624
00:34:39,355 --> 00:34:40,154
Look.

625
00:34:42,355 --> 00:34:44,035
What did they mix in there?

626
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,234
Bloodshed Weapon.

627
00:34:50,915 --> 00:34:52,114
The Bloodshed Weapons

628
00:34:52,114 --> 00:34:53,795
are unique to our Xia Clan.

629
00:34:54,154 --> 00:34:54,995
How is it possible?

630
00:34:55,315 --> 00:34:56,674
I knew it.

631
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,554
With the power of these demons,

632
00:35:00,674 --> 00:35:02,395
how could they defeat my Sea God Palace

633
00:35:02,395 --> 00:35:03,634
so miserably?

634
00:35:04,674 --> 00:35:05,955
It turns out they mixed

635
00:35:05,955 --> 00:35:07,835
Bloodshed Weapons in their bodies.

636
00:35:08,154 --> 00:35:09,435
Bloodshed Weapons

637
00:35:09,435 --> 00:35:11,634
can even fight against Transcendents.

638
00:35:12,355 --> 00:35:13,074
Look into it.

639
00:35:13,754 --> 00:35:14,554
Now!

640
00:35:14,915 --> 00:35:16,674
Even if we have to
turn the empire upside down,

641
00:35:16,674 --> 00:35:17,594
we must find out

642
00:35:17,594 --> 00:35:19,554
which bloodshed armory

643
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:20,674
is colluding with the Demon Clan.

644
00:35:20,714 --> 00:35:21,395
Once I find

645
00:35:21,395 --> 00:35:23,234
the traitor colluding
with the Demon Clan,

646
00:35:24,274 --> 00:35:26,915
I'll turn him into dust for sure.

647
00:35:27,395 --> 00:35:28,835
I know the Council
is busy with your duties,

648
00:35:29,234 --> 00:35:30,754
so I, Situ Hong, Changfeng's disciple,

649
00:35:30,955 --> 00:35:33,194
volunteer to take the lead
and investigate.

650
00:35:35,035 --> 00:35:35,915
I'll go too.

651
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:37,795
Please rest assured to leave it to us.

652
00:35:37,835 --> 00:35:39,035
We'll definitely search through

653
00:35:39,035 --> 00:35:40,634
all the weapon shops in the empire.

654
00:35:40,915 --> 00:35:42,754
Since the Bloodshed Weapons
have appeared,

655
00:35:42,754 --> 00:35:44,714
following this clue and investigating,

656
00:35:44,955 --> 00:35:46,074
there must be some

657
00:35:46,074 --> 00:35:47,035
traces.

658
00:35:47,274 --> 00:35:49,074
Whoever is behind this

659
00:35:49,274 --> 00:35:50,395
will come to light.

660
00:35:50,714 --> 00:35:52,194
(Xueying will not die.)

661
00:35:52,835 --> 00:35:54,355
(I must find the traitor.)

662
00:35:54,915 --> 00:35:57,355
I volunteer to go together.

663
00:35:59,395 --> 00:36:00,955
You all must be careful.

664
00:36:02,074 --> 00:36:02,835
Yes.

665
00:36:04,355 --> 00:36:05,395
(Xueying,)

666
00:36:06,194 --> 00:36:07,355
