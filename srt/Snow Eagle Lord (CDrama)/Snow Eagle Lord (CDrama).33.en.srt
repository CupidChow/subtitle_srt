Young Master.

22
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:04,330
Young Master,

23
00:02:04,571 --> 00:02:06,291
I've made some imperial blood soup.

24
00:02:06,371 --> 00:02:08,171
As you've been looking pale lately,

25
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:09,810
I hope it helps.

26
00:02:11,930 --> 00:02:13,330
Thank you, Mrs. Xue.

27
00:02:13,531 --> 00:02:14,810
Let me help you comb your hair.

28
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:28,731
Young Master.

29
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:30,330
T-This is...

30
00:02:33,971 --> 00:02:35,890
Just a few strands of hair.

31
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,050
Mrs. Xue,

32
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:39,011
it's not a big deal.

33
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,490
Young Master,

34
00:02:52,210 --> 00:02:54,131
what exactly has happened recently?

35
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,770
You must be honest with me.

36
00:02:56,171 --> 00:02:57,770
What exactly have you done?

37
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:59,330
You must tell me.

38
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:17,650
As the saying goes, there's a barrier
between humans and gods.

39
00:03:18,971 --> 00:03:20,971
Gods cannot stay in the human world.

40
00:03:22,090 --> 00:03:23,210
Once the seal of the divine vein

41
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:24,810
in your body is broken,

42
00:03:26,291 --> 00:03:26,971
your body

43
00:03:27,050 --> 00:03:28,731
will only become weaker and weaker

44
00:03:30,490 --> 00:03:32,251
until you vanish.

45
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,210
But my divine consciousness

46
00:03:35,291 --> 00:03:36,810
has not fully recovered yet.

47
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:39,490
It means the seal is still there.

48
00:03:40,531 --> 00:03:41,971
So why is it happening?

49
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:44,090
It's because of Xueying.

50
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:48,571
Xueying?

51
00:03:49,131 --> 00:03:51,330
Xueying has awakened
his Ancient Bloodline.

52
00:03:52,531 --> 00:03:53,770
Ancient Bloodline

53
00:03:53,770 --> 00:03:54,650
is the only thing in the human world

54
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,090
that can kill gods.

55
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:59,731
The saying
"kill gods when encountering gods;

56
00:04:00,330 --> 00:04:01,770
kill demons when encountering demons"

57
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,971
refers to Ancient Bloodline.

58
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:08,291
No wonder.

59
00:04:10,610 --> 00:04:11,890
No wonder last time,

60
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:13,251
when Xueying awakened

61
00:04:13,330 --> 00:04:14,490
his Ancient Bloodline,

62
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:18,610
I felt like I was suffocating.

63
00:04:19,250 --> 00:04:20,610
My little master,

64
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:22,690
I didn't let you be with Xueying

65
00:04:22,810 --> 00:04:24,211
right because of this.

66
00:04:24,331 --> 00:04:26,370
Xueying is naturally your nemesis.

67
00:04:36,690 --> 00:04:38,531
I know you're upset.

68
00:04:40,731 --> 00:04:43,010
Actually, I was also praying
day and night

69
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:45,891
that Xueying's Ancient Bloodline

70
00:04:46,010 --> 00:04:47,171
will not awaken.

71
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:49,370
So that what counter-attacks you
in your fate

72
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:51,250
would not happen to you,

73
00:04:52,130 --> 00:04:54,130
but it's already happened.

74
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:55,651
If you continue like this,

75
00:04:55,731 --> 00:04:56,930
and persist in staying with him,

76
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,610
in the end, you will vanish

77
00:05:00,370 --> 00:05:01,971
and be completely consumed.

78
00:05:06,010 --> 00:05:07,610
Is there any other way?

79
00:05:08,771 --> 00:05:10,250
There must be another way,

80
00:05:10,331 --> 00:05:11,091
right?

81
00:05:14,810 --> 00:05:16,130
The only way

82
00:05:17,531 --> 00:05:19,331
is to return to Heavenly Palace.

83
00:05:23,211 --> 00:05:24,050
Young Master,

84
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:28,450
actually, what lies before you

85
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:30,651
are only two paths.

86
00:05:31,731 --> 00:05:33,171
Either return to Heavenly Palace

87
00:05:34,050 --> 00:05:35,370
and be separated forever,

88
00:05:35,531 --> 00:05:36,651
never to see each other again,

89
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,971
or stay here

90
00:05:41,810 --> 00:05:43,810
and accompany Xueying for a short while

91
00:05:45,690 --> 00:05:47,731
until you vanish.

92
00:06:02,531 --> 00:06:03,891
Let me figure it out.

93
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:06,731
Let me think about what to do.

94
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:09,651
Let me mull it over.

95
00:06:09,771 --> 00:06:10,891
Young Master.

96
00:06:14,651 --> 00:06:16,130
Mrs. Xue, listen to my command.

97
00:06:19,370 --> 00:06:20,331
I,

98
00:06:21,490 --> 00:06:22,171
for the first time,

99
00:06:22,171 --> 00:06:23,731
as the young master of the Moxue Empire,

100
00:06:23,851 --> 00:06:25,731
order Mrs. Xue to keep silent.

101
00:06:28,450 --> 00:06:29,570
Not to reveal to anyone

102
00:06:29,570 --> 00:06:31,370
what we've talked about today.

103
00:06:31,771 --> 00:06:32,690
Otherwise,

104
00:06:33,370 --> 00:06:34,610
I will never

105
00:06:34,610 --> 00:06:36,050
set foot in Moxue Empire again.

106
00:06:36,651 --> 00:06:37,570
Do you understand?

107
00:06:44,171 --> 00:06:45,810
Yes, Young Master.

108
00:07:07,171 --> 00:07:08,211
Mrs. Xue,

109
00:07:08,411 --> 00:07:09,331
come in.

110
00:07:16,130 --> 00:07:16,930
It's my first time

111
00:07:16,930 --> 00:07:17,930
wearing such a bright dress.

112
00:07:18,050 --> 00:07:19,450
What do you think, Mrs. Xue?

113
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:22,690
Young Master, what are you...

114
00:07:23,091 --> 00:07:24,731
Red gives off a cheerful feeling.

115
00:07:24,930 --> 00:07:25,651
Oh, right.

116
00:07:25,810 --> 00:07:27,171
Mrs. Xue, could you please

117
00:07:27,291 --> 00:07:28,250
do make-up for me?

118
00:07:28,370 --> 00:07:29,610
So that it will make me

119
00:07:29,731 --> 00:07:31,010
look healthier.

120
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,291
You are the princess of the Moxue Empire

121
00:07:35,370 --> 00:07:36,851
and the goddess
who has fallen into the human world.

122
00:07:37,331 --> 00:07:38,291
I will definitely

123
00:07:38,411 --> 00:07:39,731
make you look beautiful.

124
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:28,731
Xueying,

125
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:29,731
how's your health lately?

126
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:30,771
Come, come, come.

127
00:08:30,891 --> 00:08:32,130
Take a deep breath.

128
00:08:32,251 --> 00:08:33,930
Do you feel like you're floating?

129
00:08:34,810 --> 00:08:35,531
Yu Feng,

130
00:08:35,651 --> 00:08:36,730
what's wrong with you again?

131
00:08:36,730 --> 00:08:38,411
Xueying is now at the Saint Level.

132
00:08:38,411 --> 00:08:39,730
The highest level

133
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:40,690
among our Xinhuo Palace disciples.

134
00:08:40,810 --> 00:08:41,771
Xueying, tell us,

135
00:08:41,771 --> 00:08:42,651
how does it feel?

136
00:08:43,171 --> 00:08:44,730
I just awakened the Ancient Bloodline

137
00:08:44,930 --> 00:08:46,210
and my body hasn't fully recovered yet.

138
00:08:46,411 --> 00:08:47,291
To be honest,

139
00:08:47,411 --> 00:08:48,771
I don't feel anything at the moment.

140
00:08:49,771 --> 00:08:51,291
Xueying has advanced

141
00:08:51,411 --> 00:08:52,771
but hasn't become immortal.

142
00:08:52,970 --> 00:08:53,690
When you yourself

143
00:08:53,690 --> 00:08:55,330
cultivate to that level,

144
00:08:55,450 --> 00:08:56,730
naturally, you'll feel it too.

145
00:09:14,570 --> 00:09:16,651
I don't know if Xueying
has become immortal or not,

146
00:09:17,411 --> 00:09:19,531
but I'm sure I've seen a fairy.

147
00:09:34,570 --> 00:09:35,371
What's wrong?

148
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,891
Is there something inappropriate?

149
00:09:38,011 --> 00:09:40,371
A beauty's makeup
surpasses the beauty of lotus.

150
00:09:40,450 --> 00:09:43,291
The scent of jade and pearls wafts with
the wind to the palace by river.

151
00:09:43,771 --> 00:09:45,011
The aloof goddess

152
00:09:45,011 --> 00:09:46,930
finally experiences
the mortal world's joys.

153
00:09:47,450 --> 00:09:47,970
Understanding

154
00:09:47,970 --> 00:09:50,011
the principle of pleasing
oneself you love by making up.

155
00:09:52,011 --> 00:09:53,330
However,

156
00:09:53,450 --> 00:09:54,651
to be honest,

157
00:09:54,771 --> 00:09:56,690
outfit coordination

158
00:09:56,690 --> 00:09:57,531
is a profound knowledge.

159
00:09:58,090 --> 00:09:59,291
For example, your clothes

160
00:09:59,291 --> 00:10:00,611
are already red.

161
00:10:00,730 --> 00:10:01,690
Then, the handkerchief

162
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:03,050
should be in a different color.

163
00:10:03,210 --> 00:10:04,491
Why don't you come to my place

164
00:10:04,611 --> 00:10:05,730
and I'll teach you well?

165
00:10:06,131 --> 00:10:06,771
Don't bother.

166
00:10:07,050 --> 00:10:08,371
In my eyes,

167
00:10:08,531 --> 00:10:10,251
Jingqiu is always the most beautiful.

168
00:10:13,891 --> 00:10:14,690
Xueying.

169
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:22,011
Did you see that?

170
00:10:22,210 --> 00:10:23,291
Learn from him.

171
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:26,970
When will you get it?

172
00:11:15,850 --> 00:11:16,850
Dongbo Xueying, you...

173
00:11:16,850 --> 00:11:17,291
What are you doing?

174
00:11:17,291 --> 00:11:18,291
You just stared at me for so long.

175
00:11:18,570 --> 00:11:19,690
I need my perks

176
00:11:19,690 --> 00:11:20,570
to make it fair.

177
00:11:22,210 --> 00:11:24,131
Isn't that a loss

178
00:11:24,251 --> 00:11:25,330
just taking back a few?

179
00:11:33,050 --> 00:11:33,771
Jingqiu,

180
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:35,930
you're really different today.

181
00:11:36,570 --> 00:11:37,771
Do you like it?

182
00:11:38,131 --> 00:11:39,411
I like you no matter what you look like.

183
00:11:43,491 --> 00:11:44,771
The old me

184
00:11:45,251 --> 00:11:46,850
always liked to hide behind

185
00:11:46,930 --> 00:11:48,450
Master and my senior brothers,

186
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,690
wishing no one would see me.

187
00:11:51,371 --> 00:11:53,171
But now I regret it.

188
00:11:54,251 --> 00:11:56,330
I should have been more noticeable.

189
00:11:56,611 --> 00:11:57,611
This way,

190
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:58,930
you could have

191
00:11:58,930 --> 00:11:59,891
noticed me sooner.

192
00:12:00,771 --> 00:12:02,090
I'm glad you didn't do that.

193
00:12:02,531 --> 00:12:04,291
One Situ Hong is annoying enough.
[*Hong shares same pronunciation with red]

194
00:12:04,491 --> 00:12:05,291
I wouldn't want

195
00:12:05,291 --> 00:12:07,050
another Situ Purple, Situ Green,

196
00:12:07,050 --> 00:12:08,611
Situ Flower or whatever.

197
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:15,930
What to do?

198
00:12:16,771 --> 00:12:18,730
I can't remove my mark.

199
00:12:18,970 --> 00:12:20,210
Then don't remove it.

200
00:12:20,690 --> 00:12:21,291
Then,

201
00:12:21,371 --> 00:12:22,291
what if

202
00:12:22,291 --> 00:12:23,131
others see it?

203
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:25,210
I'll say it's from Yu Jingqiu.

204
00:12:25,930 --> 00:12:27,210
How could that be?

205
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:29,730
Jingqiu,

206
00:12:31,171 --> 00:12:32,131
if you continue like this,

207
00:12:32,251 --> 00:12:33,730
I really can't bear to leave you.

208
00:12:34,291 --> 00:12:35,411
Leave?

209
00:12:37,131 --> 00:12:38,371
Where are you going?

210
00:12:43,291 --> 00:12:44,491
Si An gave this to me.

211
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:45,810
It said there's something unusual
at Black Wind Cliff.

212
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,050
(Strange signs at Black Wind Cliff. Go check now.)
He asked me to go check the details.

213
00:12:50,131 --> 00:12:50,771
Jingqiu.

214
00:12:51,251 --> 00:12:53,131
Jingqiu, what's wrong with you?

215
00:12:53,371 --> 00:12:54,611
You've been coughing lately.

216
00:12:55,411 --> 00:12:56,330
It's nothing.

217
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:58,330
Just a little Qi deficiency.

218
00:12:58,531 --> 00:12:59,810
These days, Mrs. Xue

219
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:01,330
has been making soup for me.

220
00:13:01,450 --> 00:13:02,570
You don't have to worry too much.

221
00:13:02,730 --> 00:13:03,771
A martial artist

222
00:13:03,891 --> 00:13:05,090
isn't that fragile.

223
00:13:06,450 --> 00:13:07,131
Right,

224
00:13:07,810 --> 00:13:09,011
when do you plan

225
00:13:09,011 --> 00:13:10,291
to set off for Black Wind Cliff?

226
00:13:11,611 --> 00:13:12,450
Tomorrow.

227
00:13:13,050 --> 00:13:14,050
Tomorrow.

228
00:13:14,570 --> 00:13:15,891
Then I'll go with you.

229
00:13:24,771 --> 00:13:25,651
What?

230
00:13:26,131 --> 00:13:26,810
No.

231
00:13:26,891 --> 00:13:28,090
Absolutely not.

232
00:13:28,371 --> 00:13:29,251
Young Master,

233
00:13:29,411 --> 00:13:30,131
your body

234
00:13:30,131 --> 00:13:31,730
has already been so weak.

235
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:32,850
How can you go to Black Wind Cliff

236
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:33,970
with Xueying?

237
00:13:34,090 --> 00:13:35,090
The remnants of the Demon God

238
00:13:35,251 --> 00:13:36,690
have been destroyed by Moyang Yu.

239
00:13:36,850 --> 00:13:38,291
Those scattered demons

240
00:13:38,411 --> 00:13:39,730
are no match for Xueying.

241
00:13:39,850 --> 00:13:41,651
Mrs. Xue, don't worry.

242
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,251
What I fear is not the Demon Clan

243
00:13:43,371 --> 00:13:44,411
but Xueying.

244
00:13:45,050 --> 00:13:46,011
Young Master,

245
00:13:46,210 --> 00:13:47,210
when will you stop

246
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:48,251
deceiving yourself?

247
00:13:50,450 --> 00:13:52,011
It's only been a day

248
00:13:52,210 --> 00:13:52,850
and the handkerchief was even stained

249
00:13:52,850 --> 00:13:54,171
by blood like this.

250
00:13:54,450 --> 00:13:55,891
If this continues,

251
00:13:56,251 --> 00:13:57,210
I'm afraid...

252
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:01,491
Mrs. Xue,

253
00:14:02,131 --> 00:14:03,651
I know you're worried about me.

254
00:14:04,171 --> 00:14:05,371
But Xueying has finally

255
00:14:05,371 --> 00:14:06,531
cheered up.

256
00:14:06,850 --> 00:14:07,730
If I suddenly

257
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:08,850
leave now,

258
00:14:09,011 --> 00:14:10,371
he won't be able to bear it.

259
00:14:10,531 --> 00:14:12,491
Your body can't bear it even more.

260
00:14:14,090 --> 00:14:15,411
That's why

261
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:17,210
I should cherish

262
00:14:17,330 --> 00:14:18,970
every day together with Xueying.

263
00:14:19,371 --> 00:14:20,251
I want to leave him

264
00:14:20,251 --> 00:14:21,371
beautiful memories.

265
00:14:22,131 --> 00:14:23,371
Only like this,

266
00:14:23,970 --> 00:14:26,090
when he thinks of me in the future,

267
00:14:26,531 --> 00:14:27,491
what remains isn't just

268
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,850
sadness and regret.

269
00:14:29,611 --> 00:14:30,730
Young Master,

270
00:14:32,210 --> 00:14:34,011
you are the princess of Moxue Empire.

271
00:14:35,011 --> 00:14:37,050
Why go through all this trouble

272
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,251
for a mortal boy?

273
00:14:41,131 --> 00:14:42,371
Mrs. Xue,

274
00:14:42,531 --> 00:14:43,930
please let me go.

275
00:14:44,251 --> 00:14:46,011
Once I return from Black Wind Cliff,

276
00:14:46,171 --> 00:14:47,651
we'll go back to Moxue Empire.

277
00:14:59,491 --> 00:15:01,251
Rustling like the wind
under the solemn pine,

278
00:15:01,291 --> 00:15:02,570
high, far, gentle, and long.

279
00:15:12,050 --> 00:15:12,810
Xueying,

280
00:15:12,930 --> 00:15:14,611
the young master's body
hasn't been well lately.

281
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:15,810
Take good care of her.

282
00:15:17,251 --> 00:15:18,531
You said before
that you had a Qi deficiency.

283
00:15:18,651 --> 00:15:19,411
It still hasn't gotten better?

284
00:15:19,450 --> 00:15:20,771
It's already not a problem.

285
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:22,291
Since I was little in Moxue Empire,

286
00:15:22,411 --> 00:15:24,011
Mrs. Xue has always doted on me.

287
00:15:24,570 --> 00:15:26,570
She likes to make a big fuss
over small things.

288
00:15:27,730 --> 00:15:28,930
Are you really alright?

289
00:15:30,131 --> 00:15:30,970
Am I right?

290
00:15:33,011 --> 00:15:33,891
Young Master,

291
00:15:34,011 --> 00:15:35,131
you have a delicate body.

292
00:15:35,251 --> 00:15:36,531
It's better to be cautious.

293
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:37,651
I know.

294
00:15:37,771 --> 00:15:38,450
Don't worry.

295
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:40,210
Mrs. Xue, rest assured,

296
00:15:40,371 --> 00:15:41,570
I'll take good care of Jingqiu.

297
00:16:01,970 --> 00:16:02,930
Let's go take a look over there.

298
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:03,570
Let's go.

299
00:16:03,570 --> 00:16:04,090
Chase them.

300
00:16:04,970 --> 00:16:05,810
Xueying.

301
00:16:07,611 --> 00:16:08,251
Jingqiu.

302
00:16:09,690 --> 00:16:10,450
Jingqiu.

303
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:11,651
How are you?

304
00:16:11,651 --> 00:16:12,771
I'm not feeling well.

305
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:14,531
I need to rest for a while.

306
00:16:14,651 --> 00:16:15,210
Alright.

307
00:16:15,371 --> 00:16:16,810
Let's find a place to rest.

308
00:16:38,570 --> 00:16:39,330
You're awake.

309
00:16:39,531 --> 00:16:40,450
How do you feel?

310
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,090
Much better.

311
00:16:42,210 --> 00:16:43,570
How did I fall asleep?

312
00:16:43,730 --> 00:16:44,970
What about the demons?

313
00:16:46,251 --> 00:16:47,651
As you said,

314
00:16:47,810 --> 00:16:49,730
there was a nest of them in the temple.

315
00:16:50,411 --> 00:16:51,850
But when I got there,

316
00:16:52,011 --> 00:16:53,050
there were only a few demons.

317
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:54,090
Their leader wasn't there.

318
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:55,730
It's a pity.

319
00:16:55,810 --> 00:16:56,491
Otherwise,

320
00:16:56,611 --> 00:16:57,930
we could've caught them all at once.

321
00:16:58,371 --> 00:16:59,730
It's not a total loss.

322
00:17:00,090 --> 00:17:00,891
It's just that now,

323
00:17:01,011 --> 00:17:02,251
we have more important things to do.

324
00:17:03,771 --> 00:17:04,851
What's it?

325
00:17:05,010 --> 00:17:05,770
Take a look.

326
00:17:06,250 --> 00:17:07,091
Where is this?

327
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:11,051
I didn't expect the treehouse

328
00:17:11,051 --> 00:17:12,091
to still be here.

329
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:13,851
Look up.

330
00:17:20,811 --> 00:17:22,770
You said the most important thing

331
00:17:22,930 --> 00:17:24,051
is this, huh?

332
00:17:25,770 --> 00:17:27,131
My mother once told me,

333
00:17:27,730 --> 00:17:28,651
in this world,

334
00:17:28,891 --> 00:17:29,851
there are two things

335
00:17:29,851 --> 00:17:30,970
most worthy of our admiration.

336
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:33,250
One is the splendid starry sky
above our heads.

337
00:17:34,131 --> 00:17:35,891
And the other is the person we love.

338
00:17:36,930 --> 00:17:38,411
Now I have both.

339
00:17:38,530 --> 00:17:39,091
Isn't this

340
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:40,131
the most important thing?

341
00:17:46,651 --> 00:17:47,611
Why are you looking at me?

342
00:17:47,690 --> 00:17:48,611
Look at the stars.

343
00:17:49,371 --> 00:17:50,970
You're more beautiful than the stars.

344
00:18:02,490 --> 00:18:03,331
There's a shooting star.

345
00:18:04,171 --> 00:18:05,131
I saw it.

346
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:07,171
Why didn't you make a wish?

347
00:18:08,171 --> 00:18:09,411
I heard

348
00:18:09,530 --> 00:18:10,930
that when a person dies,

349
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,131
a shooting star

350
00:18:12,131 --> 00:18:13,530
will cross the sky.

351
00:18:13,970 --> 00:18:14,730
This shooting star

352
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:16,091
is already so sad.

353
00:18:16,131 --> 00:18:18,051
Isn't that a bit too cruel

354
00:18:18,210 --> 00:18:19,770
to ask it to fulfill my wish?

355
00:18:20,891 --> 00:18:22,010
When you put it like that,

356
00:18:22,171 --> 00:18:23,250
it does seem to make sense.

357
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:25,571
You didn't make a wish either, did you?

358
00:18:27,571 --> 00:18:29,051
My wish is too difficult.

359
00:18:30,450 --> 00:18:31,651
It can't help me.

360
00:18:35,851 --> 00:18:37,131
Tell me.

361
00:18:37,290 --> 00:18:39,051
Maybe I can help you.

362
00:18:39,571 --> 00:18:41,331
No more talking, let's sleep.

363
00:18:41,571 --> 00:18:42,690
I just woke up.

364
00:18:42,690 --> 00:18:43,611
How could I possibly sleep?

365
00:18:43,611 --> 00:18:44,970
What's wrong with you?

366
00:18:45,051 --> 00:18:46,770
If you can't sleep, count the stars.

367
00:18:54,131 --> 00:18:55,131
Xueying,

368
00:18:55,651 --> 00:18:57,930
do you think when the stars can't sleep,

369
00:18:58,091 --> 00:18:59,371
they count humans?

370
00:18:59,891 --> 00:19:01,131
One person.

371
00:19:01,250 --> 00:19:02,210
Two people.

372
00:19:02,210 --> 00:19:02,930
Jingqiu,

373
00:19:04,690 --> 00:19:06,010
if you really can't sleep,

374
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:07,970
I don't mind helping.

375
00:19:09,730 --> 00:19:10,411
Don't bother.

376
00:19:10,411 --> 00:19:11,651
I can fall asleep.

377
00:19:12,611 --> 00:19:13,891
What are you thinking?

378
00:19:14,651 --> 00:19:16,371
I really have something to give you.

379
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:43,651

Be careful, be careful.

392
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:48,171
I told you not to squeeze.

393
00:20:54,171 --> 00:20:54,970
Jingqiu.

394
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:56,651
Why did you all come here?

395
00:20:57,571 --> 00:20:58,611
You don't know

396
00:20:58,611 --> 00:20:59,331
how powerful Xueying is now.

397
00:20:59,331 --> 00:21:00,490
He's reached the Saint Level.

398
00:21:00,611 --> 00:21:02,131
He can take us through the Void Realm.

399
00:21:02,131 --> 00:21:03,851
Bringing us to Black Wind Cliff
must be a piece of cake.

400
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:04,930
Jingqiu,

401
00:21:05,051 --> 00:21:05,970
this is what Xueying

402
00:21:05,970 --> 00:21:06,811
asked us to help him

403
00:21:06,811 --> 00:21:07,651
arrange for you.

404
00:21:10,930 --> 00:21:11,930
All of this

405
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:13,851
was arranged by you?

406
00:21:15,010 --> 00:21:16,411
Yes, but

407
00:21:16,571 --> 00:21:17,730
they helped too.

408
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:19,651
Then,

409
00:21:20,010 --> 00:21:21,530
the Dragon Mountain Order
of Black Wind Cliff

410
00:21:21,571 --> 00:21:22,490
is also fake.

411
00:21:23,131 --> 00:21:24,450
That was a small favor

412
00:21:24,450 --> 00:21:25,490
I asked Si An for help.

413
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:32,411
Jingqiu,

414
00:21:33,131 --> 00:21:34,290
are you angry?

415
00:21:36,730 --> 00:21:38,210
How could I be angry?

416
00:21:39,851 --> 00:21:41,210
I'm so happy.

417
00:21:42,651 --> 00:21:43,611
Xueying,

418
00:21:45,051 --> 00:21:46,811
thank you for everything
you've done for me.

419
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:48,411
Can you promise me

420
00:21:48,411 --> 00:21:49,290
one thing?

421
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:50,651
What is it?

422
00:21:54,651 --> 00:21:55,930
Where did you find it?

423
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:58,010
I thought I lost it

424
00:21:58,290 --> 00:21:59,611
when I was at Demon God Association.

425
00:21:59,811 --> 00:22:01,210
This time you have to keep it safe.

426
00:22:02,331 --> 00:22:02,811

Jingqiu.

00:24:47,891 --> 00:24:49,171

Alright, I'll get it.

471
00:24:55,171 --> 00:24:56,411

00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:57,371
let me handle them.

What's wrong, Young Master?

477
00:25:02,290 --> 00:25:03,770
Is there any discomfort again?

478
00:25:12,171 --> 00:25:13,970

479
00:25:14,250 --> 00:25:15,250
I'm hungry.

480
00:25:16,371 --> 00:25:18,250
Young Master, is this because
you think I'm in the way?

481
00:25:18,970 --> 00:25:20,171
I'll leave right away.

482
00:25:27,290 --> 00:25:28,371
I'm sorry.

483
00:25:28,770 --> 00:25:30,571
Mrs. Xue was just...

484
00:25:30,611 --> 00:25:31,331
It's okay.

485
00:25:31,530 --> 00:25:32,530
I understand.

486
00:25:33,051 --> 00:25:33,970
It's just...

487
00:25:34,530 --> 00:25:35,331
Why has your body

488
00:25:35,331 --> 00:25:36,290
become so weak?

489
00:25:38,530 --> 00:25:40,690
Do you remember when Xinhuo Palace

490
00:25:40,930 --> 00:25:42,611
was attacked by the demonic smoke

491
00:25:42,930 --> 00:25:44,331
and we fought with all our might?

492
00:25:44,851 --> 00:25:46,051
My divine bloodline

493
00:25:46,171 --> 00:25:47,530
also awakened

494
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:48,611
during that battle, right?

495
00:25:48,930 --> 00:25:49,611
I remember.

496
00:25:50,371 --> 00:25:51,210
At that time, we all saw

497
00:25:51,210 --> 00:25:51,891
your change.

498
00:25:52,131 --> 00:25:53,171
At that time,

499
00:25:53,331 --> 00:25:55,290
I was injured by the demonic smoke.

500
00:25:55,851 --> 00:25:57,530
In order to quickly join the battle

501
00:25:57,730 --> 00:25:58,811
to assist you all,

502
00:25:59,051 --> 00:26:00,371
I didn't care about anything else

503
00:26:01,091 --> 00:26:02,690
and drank the source stone sap.

504
00:26:03,411 --> 00:26:05,010
I felt a strange current

505
00:26:05,331 --> 00:26:07,171
inside my body

506
00:26:07,811 --> 00:26:09,530
that made me want to throw up.

507
00:26:10,091 --> 00:26:11,290
At the same time,

508
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:13,450
another stronger current

509
00:26:13,770 --> 00:26:15,250
was desperately suppressing it.

510
00:26:15,611 --> 00:26:17,371
Two forces were fighting each other.

511
00:26:18,250 --> 00:26:19,171
Perhaps,

512
00:26:19,331 --> 00:26:21,331
my divine bloodline's power was stronger

513
00:26:21,730 --> 00:26:23,450
and defeated that current,

514
00:26:23,611 --> 00:26:25,690
so that's how
my divine bloodline awakened.

515
00:26:28,851 --> 00:26:30,131
After coming back,

516
00:26:30,411 --> 00:26:32,371
Mrs. Xue took care of me

517
00:26:32,571 --> 00:26:33,891
and separated that power

518
00:26:34,411 --> 00:26:36,331
from my body.

519
00:26:36,930 --> 00:26:38,290
She then discovered

520
00:26:38,891 --> 00:26:40,690
it turned out to be a Demonic Soul Pill.

521
00:26:41,250 --> 00:26:42,290
Demonic Soul Pill?

522
00:26:44,091 --> 00:26:45,131
In order to completely remove

523
00:26:45,131 --> 00:26:46,290
the Demonic Soul Pill

524
00:26:46,331 --> 00:26:47,371
and the Snowflake Mark from my body,

525
00:26:48,171 --> 00:26:49,571
I made every effort.

526
00:26:50,730 --> 00:26:53,371
So, my Internal Energy is so weak now.

527
00:26:53,571 --> 00:26:54,450
But the Demonic Soul Pill

528
00:26:54,450 --> 00:26:55,651
is the thing of the Demon Clan.

529
00:26:55,811 --> 00:26:57,051
How could it be on you?

530
00:26:57,811 --> 00:26:59,371
I might have been careless

531
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,250
and caught in someone's scheme.

532
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:12,970
Now that I think about it,

533
00:27:13,690 --> 00:27:15,611
I'm afraid
there's a problem with the sap.

534
00:27:16,530 --> 00:27:17,811
So at that time,

535
00:27:18,730 --> 00:27:20,171
the person who took out
the source stone sap

536
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,131
was very suspicious.

537
00:27:21,371 --> 00:27:22,091
Who was it?

538
00:27:24,010 --> 00:27:25,091
Situ Hong.

539
00:27:28,171 --> 00:27:28,891
Jingqiu.

540
00:27:42,530 --> 00:27:43,210
Jingqiu.

541
00:27:44,811 --> 00:27:46,051
You should rest now.

542
00:27:46,171 --> 00:27:47,290
Don't think about anything.

543
00:27:47,770 --> 00:27:48,851
For our wedding,

544
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:50,450
we'll table it until you get better.

545
00:27:51,290 --> 00:27:51,930
No.

546
00:27:52,450 --> 00:27:53,371
I don't want to.

547
00:27:54,851 --> 00:27:56,450
We should hold the wedding
as soon as possible.

548
00:28:00,131 --> 00:28:01,611
I-I mean

549
00:28:02,690 --> 00:28:04,371
I am fine.

550
00:28:04,611 --> 00:28:06,490
A lot has happened recently.

551
00:28:07,131 --> 00:28:08,970
With such a joyous event,

552
00:28:09,171 --> 00:28:10,331
perhaps,

553
00:28:10,651 --> 00:28:12,171
it can dilute some sadness.

554
00:28:14,930 --> 00:28:16,490
But with such a tight schedule,

555
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:17,651
I'm afraid I won't be able to

556
00:28:17,651 --> 00:28:18,411
prepare many things.

557
00:28:18,411 --> 00:28:19,690
I don't need any grandeur.

558
00:28:20,091 --> 00:28:21,851
I just want it to be simple.

559
00:28:25,010 --> 00:28:26,250
Why are you laughing?

560
00:28:27,010 --> 00:28:28,490
Look at you, in such a hurry.

561
00:28:29,490 --> 00:28:30,450
Don't worry.

562
00:28:30,930 --> 00:28:32,210
The Lady of Xueying Territory.

563
00:28:32,331 --> 00:28:33,530
You won't be able to escape.

564
00:28:36,210 --> 00:28:37,571
Mrs. Xue is back.

565
00:28:37,730 --> 00:28:39,171
You'd better go back now.

566
00:28:39,331 --> 00:28:40,371
I want to stay with you for a while.

567
00:28:40,371 --> 00:28:41,371
And take care of you.

568
00:28:42,210 --> 00:28:43,571
There will be many days in the future

569
00:28:43,571 --> 00:28:44,490
when you need to take care of me.

570
00:28:44,770 --> 00:28:45,571
For now,

571
00:28:45,651 --> 00:28:47,371
don't take Mrs. Xue's job.

572
00:28:47,891 --> 00:28:48,970
Go back now.

573
00:28:59,091 --> 00:29:00,690
(Mrs. Xue)

574
00:29:01,131 --> 00:29:02,571
(treats Jingqiu so well,)

575
00:29:03,091 --> 00:29:03,770
(but why can't she)

576
00:29:03,770 --> 00:29:05,331
(be a little more polite to me?)

577
00:29:05,970 --> 00:29:07,611
(When did I offend her?)

578
00:29:31,411 --> 00:29:32,411
Mrs. Xue,

579
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:35,651
please don't be angry, okay?

580
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:36,891
I wouldn't dare.

581
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:38,811
After all, you are the young master

582
00:29:39,490 --> 00:29:40,730
and I am just a subordinate.

583
00:29:41,530 --> 00:29:43,331
Mrs. Xue, don't say that.

584
00:29:44,131 --> 00:29:44,970
I have always considered you

585
00:29:44,970 --> 00:29:46,131
as my family.

586
00:29:47,131 --> 00:29:48,651
You promised before

587
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:50,530
after returning from Black Wind Cliff,

588
00:29:50,530 --> 00:29:51,930
you would go back to
Moxue Empire with me.

589
00:29:52,690 --> 00:29:53,970
When are we leaving?

590
00:29:55,051 --> 00:29:55,891
Tomorrow,

591
00:29:56,930 --> 00:29:57,970
or the day after?

592
00:30:00,611 --> 00:30:01,651
Mrs. Xue,

593
00:30:02,851 --> 00:30:04,171
please don't push me.

594
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:05,851
I know...

595
00:30:05,851 --> 00:30:07,450
You know that
if you stay in the human world,

596
00:30:07,450 --> 00:30:08,530
you'll die soon.

597
00:30:08,530 --> 00:30:09,851
But you still won't leave.

598
00:30:10,571 --> 00:30:11,490
You know all of this

599
00:30:11,490 --> 00:30:12,611
is because of Xueying.

600
00:30:13,530 --> 00:30:15,411
But you still want to marry him.

601
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,371
I just want to be willful for once.

602
00:30:17,811 --> 00:30:19,210
Is it wrong

603
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,530
to follow my heart for this once?

604
00:30:21,770 --> 00:30:22,970
Since I was a child,

605
00:30:23,611 --> 00:30:25,730
everyone has praised me
for being well-behaved and sensible

606
00:30:25,930 --> 00:30:27,131
and considering the overall situation.

607
00:30:27,811 --> 00:30:29,091
Just this once,

608
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:31,530
I want to be myself.

609
00:30:32,051 --> 00:30:33,891
Follow my own heart.

610
00:30:34,611 --> 00:30:36,371
Do what I want to do.

611
00:30:36,891 --> 00:30:38,091
I love Xueying.

612
00:30:38,250 --> 00:30:39,770
I can't bear to leave him.

613
00:30:43,010 --> 00:30:43,930
Mrs. Xue,

614
00:30:45,530 --> 00:30:47,530
please let me be willful this time,

615
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:49,290
will you?

616
00:30:53,970 --> 00:30:54,770
Fine.

617
00:30:57,131 --> 00:30:58,171
I understand.

618
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:04,250
Sorry.

619
00:31:06,210 --> 00:31:08,611
I-I came to see Jingqiu.

620
00:31:08,770 --> 00:31:10,091
I'm here to bring her medicine.

621
00:31:15,371 --> 00:31:16,250
Jingqiu.

622
00:31:17,530 --> 00:31:18,730
Did you hear that?

623
00:31:18,930 --> 00:31:20,290
Why are you so silly?

624
00:31:20,450 --> 00:31:21,891
Why didn't you tell him?

625
00:31:22,051 --> 00:31:23,450
Don't tell Xueying.

626
00:31:23,930 --> 00:31:25,530
If Xueying knew,

627
00:31:26,051 --> 00:31:27,331
he would definitely go all out

628
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:28,450
to send me back.

629
00:31:28,770 --> 00:31:30,450
But what if something happens to you,

630
00:31:30,530 --> 00:31:31,651
Xueying

631
00:31:31,851 --> 00:31:33,131
would blame himself

632
00:31:33,290 --> 00:31:34,530
and be sad for the rest of his life.

633
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:36,450
I just want to stay and marry him.

634
00:31:37,010 --> 00:31:37,730
Even...

635
00:31:38,611 --> 00:31:40,490
Even if we're only
husband and wife for a day,

636
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,690
I would be satisfied.

637
00:31:43,490 --> 00:31:44,331
Youyue,

638
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:47,851
please help me fulfill my dream,

639
00:31:47,851 --> 00:31:48,530
alright?

640
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:50,371
Please.

641
00:32:12,290 --> 00:32:13,611
Rong, it's time to eat.

642
00:32:13,770 --> 00:32:14,770
Today we have your favorite

643
00:32:14,770 --> 00:32:15,611
scallion oil chicken.

644
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:19,411
Rong,

645
00:32:21,331 --> 00:32:22,210
are you alright?

646
00:32:24,171 --> 00:32:25,331
Qingshi,

647
00:32:25,730 --> 00:32:27,490
please let me go out.

648
00:32:27,571 --> 00:32:29,010
Otherwise, I'll go crazy.

649
00:32:29,930 --> 00:32:30,690
Rong,

650
00:32:30,930 --> 00:32:31,730
why don't we

651
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:33,450
have the meal first,

652
00:32:33,490 --> 00:32:33,970
alright?

653
00:32:33,970 --> 00:32:35,171
Please.

654
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:36,331
Just let me go.

655
00:32:36,331 --> 00:32:37,651
I beg you.

656
00:32:37,690 --> 00:32:38,490
Qingshi.

657
00:32:42,171 --> 00:32:42,930
Master.

658
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,051
You go out first.

659
00:32:46,651 --> 00:32:47,490
Yes.

660
00:32:54,490 --> 00:32:55,930
You should thank me.

661
00:32:57,970 --> 00:32:59,051
Thank?

662
00:32:59,290 --> 00:33:01,010
Before, when you worked for
the Demon Clan,

663
00:33:01,851 --> 00:33:03,490
you were just being misled

664
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:04,851
and used by them.

665
00:33:05,690 --> 00:33:07,651
But now that the Demon Clan
has been defeated,

666
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:09,490
if it weren't for me keeping you here,

667
00:33:09,651 --> 00:33:11,450
do you think you'd be alive today?

668
00:33:11,651 --> 00:33:12,611
Impossible.

669
00:33:13,571 --> 00:33:14,450
Rong,

670
00:33:14,891 --> 00:33:16,930
I've known you best since childhood.

671
00:33:17,690 --> 00:33:19,091
You're not a bad person.

672
00:33:19,730 --> 00:33:21,530
As long as you give up
your demonic technique

673
00:33:21,690 --> 00:33:22,851
and live a good life,

674
00:33:23,131 --> 00:33:24,051
I think Sikong Yang

675
00:33:24,051 --> 00:33:25,490
would do me a favor

676
00:33:26,131 --> 00:33:27,530
and spare your life.

677
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,331
Give up my demonic technique?

678
00:33:30,371 --> 00:33:31,091
Then wouldn't I

679
00:33:31,091 --> 00:33:32,371
be stepped on by everyone?

680
00:33:32,490 --> 00:33:34,010
Where would I have a place to stay?

681
00:33:34,010 --> 00:33:35,730
Could you find a place
to stay among the demons?

682
00:33:37,091 --> 00:33:37,891
They just

683
00:33:37,891 --> 00:33:39,411
used you as a tool.

684
00:33:39,811 --> 00:33:41,770
A tool to kill the Xia Clan.

685
00:33:42,051 --> 00:33:43,171
No matter what I am,

686
00:33:43,371 --> 00:33:45,091
at least they won't hurt me.

687
00:33:47,091 --> 00:33:48,171
But in the Xia Clan,

688
00:33:50,371 --> 00:33:52,331
all I got was harm.

689
00:33:54,131 --> 00:33:55,651
They killed my mother

690
00:33:56,411 --> 00:33:58,131
and now they want to kill me.

691
00:34:01,051 --> 00:34:02,490
As long as I'm alive,

692
00:34:03,131 --> 00:34:04,770
I won't forget.

693
00:34:06,051 --> 00:34:07,131
I want to avenge

694
00:34:07,131 --> 00:34:08,171
all the hurt.

695
00:34:09,531 --> 00:34:11,091
You're forcing me?

696
00:34:13,131 --> 00:34:13,931
Fine.

697
00:34:15,210 --> 00:34:17,210
While I still have a breath left,

698
00:34:18,491 --> 00:34:19,971
I'll finish you off

699
00:34:20,330 --> 00:34:21,531
in case

700
00:34:21,531 --> 00:34:22,770
you make a big mistake in the future.

701
00:34:22,971 --> 00:34:24,690
Consider it a favor for the Xia Clan.

702
00:34:26,210 --> 00:34:27,971
I accept

703
00:34:29,290 --> 00:34:30,330
dying in my master's hand.

704
00:34:56,651 --> 00:34:57,850
Reflect on it.

705
00:35:21,290 --> 00:35:21,971
Xueying.

706
00:35:25,410 --> 00:35:26,131
Master Bai.

707
00:35:26,571 --> 00:35:27,370
I hope you are well.

708
00:35:28,131 --> 00:35:29,730
You're here to see Qingshi, right?

709
00:35:30,171 --> 00:35:31,210
That kid

710
00:35:31,410 --> 00:35:32,770
just said someone was looking for him.

711
00:35:32,890 --> 00:35:34,091
I didn't expect the one looking for him

712
00:35:34,171 --> 00:35:35,611
to be his own brother.

713
00:35:35,770 --> 00:35:36,651
I'll go call him.

714
00:35:36,810 --> 00:35:37,531
Master Bai,

715
00:35:38,451 --> 00:35:39,491
today I've come

716
00:35:39,850 --> 00:35:41,531
to ask for your help with a matter.

717
00:35:42,051 --> 00:35:43,171
Please feel free to say it.

718
00:35:45,051 --> 00:35:46,931
Qingshi still doesn't know about

719
00:35:47,850 --> 00:35:49,091
the news of my mother's death.

720
00:35:49,611 --> 00:35:50,690
I don't know

721
00:35:50,690 --> 00:35:51,410
how to tell him.

722
00:35:55,051 --> 00:35:55,810
I understand.

723
00:35:56,651 --> 00:35:57,611
I'll go with you.

724
00:35:59,531 --> 00:36:00,451
Thank you, Master Bai.

725
00:36:02,370 --> 00:36:03,210
Master,

726
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:05,091
Qingshi broke the barrier

727
00:36:05,171 --> 00:36:06,410
and ran away with Ji Rong.

728
00:36:13,971 --> 00:36:14,690
Leave.

729
00:36:15,690 --> 00:36:16,531
Rong,

730
00:36:16,651 --> 00:36:17,051
you said

731
00:36:17,051 --> 00:36:18,210
there was something very important.

732
00:36:18,290 --> 00:36:19,770
I would go back with you
right after we finished it.

733
00:36:19,850 --> 00:36:21,250
I just broke Master's barrier.

734
00:36:21,330 --> 00:36:22,611
If Master finds out,

735
00:36:22,611 --> 00:36:23,011
we're definitely...

736
00:36:23,011 --> 00:36:23,850
I won't go back there.

737
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:25,571
Rong,

738
00:36:26,091 --> 00:36:27,171
you lied to me again.

739
00:36:27,850 --> 00:36:29,330
Stop following me.

740
00:36:29,370 --> 00:36:30,611
I have important things

741
00:36:30,611 --> 00:36:31,091
to do now.

742
00:36:31,091 --> 00:36:32,410
I want to do the right thing.

743
00:36:32,571 --> 00:36:33,850
What right thing?

744
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:36,091
Is it to join the Demon Clan?

745
00:36:42,210 --> 00:36:43,890
Even you start to doubt me now.

746
00:36:43,890 --> 00:36:44,890
I didn't.

747
00:36:44,971 --> 00:36:46,011
Then do you believe me?

748
00:36:46,611 --> 00:36:47,370
You've seen

749
00:36:47,370 --> 00:36:48,770
my half-human-and-half-demon appearance.

750
00:36:49,011 --> 00:36:50,410
Will you still believe me?

751
00:36:52,571 --> 00:36:53,330
Qingshi.

752
00:36:57,770 --> 00:36:58,451
Brother.

753
00:36:59,011 --> 00:36:59,890
Master.

754
00:37:00,250 --> 00:37:01,011
Rong,

755
00:37:01,250 --> 00:37:02,410
go back with Master.

756
00:37:05,131 --> 00:37:06,810
Rong, what are you doing?

757
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,210
Sorry, Qingshi,

758
00:37:08,290 --> 00:37:09,810
this is the only way I can escape.

759
00:37:09,850 --> 00:37:10,730
Let him go.

760
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:11,651
I won't.

761
00:37:11,730 --> 00:37:12,890
Unless you promise to let me go.

762
00:37:12,890 --> 00:37:13,651
You can't leave.

763
00:37:13,850 --> 00:37:15,051
Master Bai might pity you,

764
00:37:15,210 --> 00:37:15,890
but I won't.

765
00:37:16,651 --> 00:37:17,330
Rong,

766
00:37:17,770 --> 00:37:19,091
don't make more mistakes.

767
00:37:19,451 --> 00:37:20,250
Following the Demon Clan

768
00:37:20,250 --> 00:37:21,330
will lead you nowhere.

769
00:37:22,290 --> 00:37:23,011
Rong.

770
00:37:23,611 --> 00:37:24,290
You.

771
00:37:24,651 --> 00:37:25,531
(Now,)

772
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,011
(I can't afford to lose Qingshi,)

773
00:37:27,011 --> 00:37:28,091
(the only helper.)

774
00:37:29,330 --> 00:37:30,210
Qingshi,

775
00:37:30,290 --> 00:37:31,810
we've been together for so long.

776
00:37:32,131 --> 00:37:32,931
Whether I'm human or demon,

777
00:37:32,931 --> 00:37:34,210
you should know best

778
00:37:34,651 --> 00:37:35,890
if I have ever hurt you.

779
00:37:36,051 --> 00:37:36,770
Even you

780
00:37:36,770 --> 00:37:37,890
don't believe me now?

781
00:37:39,611 --> 00:37:41,051
You can deceive Qingshi

782
00:37:41,171 --> 00:37:42,290
but not me.

783
00:38:07,651 --> 00:38:08,290
Let me go.

784
00:38:08,290 --> 00:38:09,131
Go back with Master.

785
00:38:09,131 --> 00:38:09,890
Let go.

786
00:38:10,810 --> 00:38:11,410
You even fought your brother

787
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:12,690
for a woman

788
00:38:12,770 --> 00:38:13,810
who colludes with Demon Clan.

789
00:38:14,730 --> 00:38:15,290
Brother,

790
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,770
no matter what caused Ji Rong

791
00:38:16,770 --> 00:38:17,850
to become like this,

792
00:38:18,210 --> 00:38:19,451
I've always believed

793
00:38:19,651 --> 00:38:20,971
she's a kind-hearted girl.

794
00:38:21,051 --> 00:38:22,531
She's just confused for a moment.

795
00:38:22,651 --> 00:38:24,011
Let's give her another chance.

796
00:38:24,011 --> 00:38:24,611
Enough!

797
00:38:24,971 --> 00:38:25,770
Qingshi,

798
00:38:26,730 --> 00:38:27,690
can you still not

799
00:38:27,690 --> 00:38:28,451
tell right from wrong?

800
00:38:28,451 --> 00:38:29,330
Let me go.

801
00:38:29,531 --> 00:38:30,611
Qingshi!

802
00:38:31,410 --> 00:38:32,171
You're not allowed to go.

803
00:38:34,131 --> 00:38:34,810
Enough!

804
00:38:35,131 --> 00:38:36,571
I don't care if she's human or demon.

805
00:38:36,690 --> 00:38:37,890
She's still Ji Rong.

806
00:38:38,250 --> 00:38:39,210
I can't just stand by

807
00:38:39,210 --> 00:38:40,410
and watch you hurt her.

808
00:38:40,770 --> 00:38:42,051
Please let her go

809
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:44,210
for my sake.

810
00:38:44,491 --> 00:38:45,531
The more you say that,

811
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:47,651
the more I can't let her stay.

812
00:38:47,971 --> 00:38:48,850
Brother.

813
00:38:54,370 --> 00:38:55,131
Qingshi.

814
00:38:55,131 --> 00:38:55,931
Qingshi.

815
00:38:56,131 --> 00:38:56,810
Qingshi.

816
00:38:58,890 --> 00:38:59,571
Qingshi.

817
00:39:00,850 --> 00:39:01,931
You little girl.

818
00:39:02,690 --> 00:39:03,571
Qingshi!

819
00:39:03,931 --> 00:39:05,171
Qingshi!

820
00:39:07,810 --> 00:39:09,131
Qingshi.

821
00:39:27,730 --> 00:39:28,611
Brother,

822
00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:32,890
is my stick that good-looking?

823
00:39:37,451 --> 00:39:39,210
Come on, you're awake.

824
00:39:41,931 --> 00:39:42,531
Take it slow.

825
00:39:46,850 --> 00:39:47,971
Sorry, Brother,

826
00:39:48,971 --> 00:39:49,810
I shouldn't have talked to you

827
00:39:49,971 --> 00:39:51,451
like that before.

828
00:39:52,370 --> 00:39:53,210
It's alright.

829
00:39:53,850 --> 00:39:54,890
It's my negligence.

830
00:39:55,370 --> 00:39:56,410
You've grown up.

831
00:39:57,171 --> 00:39:58,290
You're at the Meteor Level now.

832
00:39:58,611 --> 00:39:59,890
Stop making fun of me.

833
00:39:59,890 --> 00:40:00,491
Brother,

834
00:40:00,850 --> 00:40:01,971
compared to you,

835
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,571
I'm far behind.

836
00:40:04,730 --> 00:40:05,810
Qingshi,

837
00:40:06,210 --> 00:40:07,011
you're not bad either.

838
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:09,051
For what I can do,

839
00:40:09,451 --> 00:40:10,730
you also can make it.

840
00:40:12,651 --> 00:40:13,571
In the past,

841
00:40:14,971 --> 00:40:16,651
I always treated you like a child.

842
00:40:17,210 --> 00:40:18,210
I protected you.

843
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:19,531
I was afraid of you getting hurt.

844
00:40:21,290 --> 00:40:22,810
But it's different now.

845
00:40:23,330 --> 00:40:24,290
There are many things

846
00:40:24,850 --> 00:40:26,330
you need to face on your own.

847
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,531
Face?

848
00:40:29,131 --> 00:40:29,810
Brother,

849
00:40:29,890 --> 00:40:31,091
what are you trying to say?

850
00:40:33,571 --> 00:40:35,330
I wanted to kill Ji Rong directly,

851
00:40:37,171 --> 00:40:38,571
but I think this is your path.

852
00:40:39,250 --> 00:40:40,651
You have to walk it yourself.

853
00:40:41,491 --> 00:40:42,730
She's locked up by Master Bai

854
00:40:42,931 --> 00:40:44,250
in the room next door.

855
00:40:45,290 --> 00:40:45,890
After you listen

856
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,290
to what I'm going to say next,

857
00:40:48,850 --> 00:40:49,770
you decide

858
00:40:51,131 --> 00:40:52,210
whether to kill her

859
00:40:53,210 --> 00:40:54,330
or let her go.

860
00:40:56,491 --> 00:40:57,131
Brother,

861
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,531
what exactly do you want to say?

862
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,091
Mother is dead.

863
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:08,491
What?

864
00:41:12,250 --> 00:41:13,250
Mother was very brave.

865
00:41:13,890 --> 00:41:15,890
She died when stopping

866
00:41:16,330 --> 00:41:17,491
the resurrection of the Great Demon God.

867
00:41:18,651 --> 00:41:19,611
Besides Mother,

868
00:41:20,451 --> 00:41:21,330
many people

869
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:22,971
sacrificed themselves
fighting the Demon Clan.

870
00:41:24,210 --> 00:41:25,451
Some were Transcendent

871
00:41:26,651 --> 00:41:28,451
and some were ordinary civilians.

872
00:41:30,011 --> 00:41:30,810
Even though

873
00:41:30,810 --> 00:41:32,250
we've paid such a high price,

874
00:41:33,410 --> 00:41:34,091
the Demon Clan

875
00:41:34,091 --> 00:41:35,531
still won't give up

876
00:41:35,611 --> 00:41:36,850
killing here and there,

877
00:41:38,611 --> 00:41:40,051
invading our territory

878
00:41:40,330 --> 00:41:41,730
and demonizing our civilians.

879
00:41:42,370 --> 00:41:43,250
And Ao Lan

880
00:41:43,810 --> 00:41:44,890
hasn't been captured yet.

881
00:41:46,410 --> 00:41:47,370
Your Ji Rong,

882
00:41:48,210 --> 00:41:49,571
is a subordinate of him.

883
00:41:52,571 --> 00:41:53,690
I've finished my words.

884
00:41:54,931 --> 00:41:56,250
What to do next

885
00:41:57,210 --> 00:41:58,290
is your own choice.

886
00:42:00,971 --> 00:42:01,770
Brother,

887
00:42:04,210 --> 00:42:05,131
why don't you tell me all this

888
00:42:05,131 --> 00:42:06,290
earlier?

889
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,491
Because I've also

890
00:42:07,491 --> 00:42:08,850
been through a lot.

891
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:11,571
I forced myself to grow up

892
00:42:13,091 --> 00:42:15,611
to protect my family and loved ones.

893
00:42:17,611 --> 00:42:18,571
Mother's death

894
00:42:20,250 --> 00:42:21,730
made me understand
that what we need to protect

895
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:22,690
is this homeland,

896
00:42:24,290 --> 00:42:26,210
the land of Dragon Mountain Empire.

897
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:31,850
And you are not only

898
00:42:31,850 --> 00:42:33,091
the younger brother of Dongbo Xueying

899
00:42:33,531 --> 00:42:35,571
but also the inheritor
of Dragon Mountain's will.

900
00:42:36,451 --> 00:42:38,250
Now I'll leave your life to you.

901
00:42:39,651 --> 00:42:40,690
You walk your own path.

902
00:42:50,810 --> 00:42:51,651
Mother.

903
00:42:53,330 --> 00:42:54,370
Mother.

904
00:42:57,611 --> 00:42:59,250
