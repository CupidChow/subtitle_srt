I'm sorry.

22
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,200
I want everything here.

23
00:01:54,439 --> 00:01:55,560
But you're not her.

24
00:01:56,879 --> 00:01:58,080
In another world,

25
00:01:58,959 --> 00:02:00,200
she's willing

26
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:00,959
to fight alongside me.

27
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:03,039
Along with my companions

28
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:05,120
and the Dragon Mountain Continent.

29
00:02:07,959 --> 00:02:09,160
I can't leave them behind.

30
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:11,160
I must go back.

31
00:02:11,839 --> 00:02:13,160
Xueying, don't be foolish.

32
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,399
You can't leave.

33
00:02:21,119 --> 00:02:22,040
Xueying,

34
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:23,799
please stay here, okay?

35
00:02:35,799 --> 00:02:36,880
This is the God of War Armor

36
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:37,999
of the Dragon Mountain Emperor?

37
00:02:39,279 --> 00:02:39,920
Right.

38
00:02:40,719 --> 00:02:42,799
This is the armor
of the Dragon Mountain Emperor.

39
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:44,040
Xueying,

40
00:02:44,399 --> 00:02:45,279
stay here.

41
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:47,519
Then you will be

42
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,440
the most prestigious leader here.

43
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:53,119
No one can

44
00:02:53,279 --> 00:02:54,440
separate us anymore.

45
00:02:55,600 --> 00:02:56,559
After putting it on,

46
00:02:57,839 --> 00:02:59,719
can I really be invincible?

47
00:03:56,839 --> 00:03:59,119
Mother, where are you?

48
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:01,760
Father, mother.

49
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:04,600
Jingqiu.

50
00:04:41,159 --> 00:04:42,640
Have you ever regretted it?

51
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,039
No.

52
00:04:47,560 --> 00:04:49,000
I just did

53
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:50,880
what I should do.

54
00:04:51,159 --> 00:04:52,039
But

55
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:56,719
I'm a little worried about Jingqiu.

56
00:04:57,159 --> 00:04:58,200
Don't worry.

57
00:04:58,760 --> 00:05:00,039
Your child

58
00:05:00,359 --> 00:05:01,599
will definitely not

59
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,120
be defeated so easily.

60
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:05,399
Yes.

61
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,560
She is my child.

62
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,399
Jingqiu,

63
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:17,200
forgive me.

64
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:32,640
(We've been seeking this armor)

65
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:34,919
(because we're not
strong enough inside.)

66
00:05:35,399 --> 00:05:36,760
(We want to rely on external help)

67
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:38,240
(to defeat a powerful opponent,)

68
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:39,680
(to solve)

69
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,880
(insuperable difficulties.)

70
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,279
(But eventually,)

71
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,399
(we still have to rely
on our own strength.)

72
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:47,719
(Maybe we'll still fail,)

73
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:49,080
(but we've already stopped)

74
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:50,440
(fearing failure.)

75
00:05:51,279 --> 00:05:52,519
Even if we fail,

76
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:55,800
we will never give up.

77
00:06:29,959 --> 00:06:30,959
It's strange.

78
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:31,839
The Gate of Time and Space

79
00:06:31,839 --> 00:06:33,080
has never been like this before.

80
00:06:36,320 --> 00:06:37,080
Master.

81
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:41,279
Master,

82
00:06:41,599 --> 00:06:42,719
is there a problem

83
00:06:42,719 --> 00:06:44,120
with the Gate of Time and Space?

84
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:45,159
No, there's not.

85
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,159
I'm just waiting for someone.

86
00:07:09,320 --> 00:07:10,279
Xueying.

87
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:29,479
I'm sorry

88
00:07:30,279 --> 00:07:31,359
for making you wait so long.

89
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:34,320
I won't disappear again.

90
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:41,760
Let's go.

91
00:07:44,200 --> 00:07:45,240
Dongbo Xueying,

92
00:07:45,399 --> 00:07:46,599
I can't believe you did come back.

93
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:51,279
I am Dongbo Xueying.

94
00:07:51,399 --> 00:07:52,240
Let me pay my respects to you, Master.

95
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:55,000
Good.

96
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,200
You're the first person

97
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:58,200
I've ever seen walk out

98
00:07:58,359 --> 00:07:59,839
of the Red Stone Barrier by himself.

99
00:08:00,039 --> 00:08:00,839
You must have gained

100
00:08:00,959 --> 00:08:02,359
a lot

101
00:08:02,519 --> 00:08:03,880
from this practice.

102
00:08:04,519 --> 00:08:07,000
Walking out of the Red Stone Barrier

103
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,399
is like being reborn

104
00:08:09,519 --> 00:08:10,839
fresh and new.

105
00:08:11,359 --> 00:08:13,279
Not only the Witch Poison
inside you is removed,

106
00:08:13,399 --> 00:08:16,120
but your mental block
has also been resolved.

107
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:19,599
Thank you for your advice and care.

108
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,880
You have finally achieved
the True Meaning of Star?

109
00:08:32,039 --> 00:08:33,599
With your current abilities,

110
00:08:33,800 --> 00:08:35,400
you have far surpassed

111
00:08:35,400 --> 00:08:36,759
the Demigod level.

112
00:08:37,359 --> 00:08:39,119
Above it is the Spiritual God level.

113
00:08:40,520 --> 00:08:41,280
Xueying,

114
00:08:41,400 --> 00:08:42,879
you're currently the one

115
00:08:42,999 --> 00:08:44,560
with the highest level

116
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:45,959
in the Dragon Mountain Empire.

117
00:08:46,119 --> 00:08:48,320
What are you going to do next?

118
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,320
What is that?

119
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:02,119
Is it

120
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,119
the Six-pointed Star Fortress?

121
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:11,599
(Good.)

122
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:13,200
(The final crystal ball)

123
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,440
(has also been successfully completed.)

124
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:15,920
(Now,)

125
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:16,800
(these puppet soldiers)

126
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,080
(are all under my control.)

127
00:09:18,639 --> 00:09:20,999
(It's time to activate
the Six-pointed Star Fortress)

128
00:09:21,520 --> 00:09:23,599
(and start the war.)

129
00:09:29,719 --> 00:09:31,080
We must go all out.

130
00:09:31,080 --> 00:09:32,119
But we are weak.

131
00:09:32,119 --> 00:09:32,800
What can we do?

132
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:33,639
I'm here too.

133
00:09:37,239 --> 00:09:38,999
Master, we must take our leave.

134
00:09:39,320 --> 00:09:40,560
Thanks to you this time,

135
00:09:40,839 --> 00:09:42,359
I was able to completely get rid
of the Witch Poison.

136
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:44,680
This is all thanks to

137
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:46,599
your persistence and willpower.

138
00:09:46,599 --> 00:09:48,759
With young heroes

139
00:09:48,759 --> 00:09:49,759
like you,

140
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:51,839
your clan won't be wiped out

141
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:52,920
by the Demon Clan.

142
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,479
This is the final battle.

143
00:09:54,879 --> 00:09:56,440
We will fight with all our might

144
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:58,280
and will never let the demons

145
00:09:58,639 --> 00:10:00,599
step into our empire again.

146
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,320
We believe in you.

147
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:03,359
Xueying,

148
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:05,040
you must believe in yourself, too.

149
00:10:07,999 --> 00:10:09,839
Master, Ms. Xi Wei,

150
00:10:09,999 --> 00:10:10,639
farewell.

151
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,080
Dongbo Xueying,

152
00:10:12,719 --> 00:10:15,560
the Dragon Mountain Empire
relies on you.

153
00:10:38,759 --> 00:10:40,359
Overconfident.

154
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,160
Stupid Xia Clan.

155
00:10:51,400 --> 00:10:53,479
- Kill!
- Kill!

156
00:10:53,999 --> 00:10:56,599
- Kill!
- Kill!

157
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:57,999
Are you afraid?

158
00:10:58,359 --> 00:10:59,800
If you're afraid,
you're not from the Xia Clan.

159
00:10:59,999 --> 00:11:01,200
Well said, bros.

160
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:02,839
We've been waiting for this day.

161
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:36,320
Qingshi.

162
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:37,639
You're here.

163
00:11:37,759 --> 00:11:38,400
How can we sit back and watch

164
00:11:38,400 --> 00:11:39,639
during such a big battle?

165
00:12:08,479 --> 00:12:09,400
Die, all of you!

166
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,639
Poor Xia Clan.

167
00:12:10,759 --> 00:12:12,759
All of your best fighters are gone.

168
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:54,080
Xueying.

169
00:12:57,719 --> 00:12:59,560
Dongbo Xueying.

170
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:15,920
Watch out!

171
00:13:34,574 --> 00:13:37,499
(Starfall Strike)

172
00:13:42,759 --> 00:13:43,440
Xueying,

173
00:13:43,639 --> 00:13:44,639
leave this to us.

174
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:47,040
You go ahead.

175
00:13:47,239 --> 00:13:47,999
Go now.

176
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:05,520
Brother!

177
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,959
- Xueying!
- Xueying!

178
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:10,920
It's really great

179
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,680
to see you again.

180
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:12,400
I knew

181
00:14:12,479 --> 00:14:13,599
the parallel space
of the Red Stone Mountain

182
00:14:13,599 --> 00:14:14,320
couldn't trap you.

183
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:15,719
The Witch Poison on you is lifted?

184
00:14:17,520 --> 00:14:19,040
Dongbo Xueying!

185
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:08,839
Xueying,

186
00:15:08,999 --> 00:15:10,400
when we return this time,

187
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,400
he will be our enemy.

188
00:15:13,200 --> 00:15:14,959
I'm afraid you're not ready

189
00:15:15,599 --> 00:15:17,040
to face him head-on.

190
00:15:19,119 --> 00:15:19,959
Xueying,

191
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:22,119
he's not your master anymore.

192
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:24,879
Just like my father and mother.

193
00:15:25,719 --> 00:15:27,839
Their bodies were taken
by the Demon Clan.

194
00:15:27,999 --> 00:15:28,800
They are bound to use them

195
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:30,119
to do some outrageously evil things.

196
00:15:31,119 --> 00:15:31,959
My parents

197
00:15:31,999 --> 00:15:33,800
sacrificed their own lives

198
00:15:34,080 --> 00:15:35,759
to protect the land of the Xia Clan.

199
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:38,719
Now they definitely don't want me

200
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:39,400
to feel pity

201
00:15:39,440 --> 00:15:40,959
for killing

202
00:15:41,280 --> 00:15:43,119
the Great Demon God

203
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:44,560
because of the bodies taken away.

204
00:15:45,320 --> 00:15:45,879
The Great Demon God

205
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,160
is our common enemy.

206
00:15:47,599 --> 00:15:48,520
This time,

207
00:15:49,520 --> 00:15:50,959
let's fight together.

208
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:09,959
Dongbo Xueying,

209
00:16:10,200 --> 00:16:11,999
you're under the curse
of the Witch God Sword,

210
00:16:12,119 --> 00:16:14,040
but you can still break through
and enter the God realm!

211
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,040
There's still someone tenacious like you

212
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,119
in the Dragon Mountain Empire.

213
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:18,879
Today,

214
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:21,320
I'm going to use this Hexagonal Sword

215
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:23,280
to finish you off.

216
00:16:51,959 --> 00:16:53,040
Who are you?

217
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:56,999
Can't you just stay quiet?

218
00:16:57,400 --> 00:16:58,119
I will absolutely not

219
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,359
sink to your level

220
00:17:00,080 --> 00:17:01,359
and betray the Xia Clan.

221
00:17:55,839 --> 00:17:57,480
Don't you want to live?

222
00:17:57,639 --> 00:17:58,879
Even if I die,

223
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:00,439
I will kill you first.

224
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,839
Don't forget

225
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:02,679
our bodies

226
00:18:02,679 --> 00:18:04,599
have now merged into one.

227
00:18:04,599 --> 00:18:05,839
Can you kill me?

228
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:08,280
I'll make you see with your own eyes

229
00:18:08,560 --> 00:18:09,960
all the fighters of your clan

230
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:11,679
die one by one,

231
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,760
including Dongbo Xueying.

232
00:18:14,839 --> 00:18:16,280
Don't you dare think about it.

233
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:26,919
Master.

234
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:35,760
Die now.

235
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:50,240
You stupid human

236
00:18:50,399 --> 00:18:51,720
with stupid emotions.

237
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:53,359
Originally, we could

238
00:18:53,359 --> 00:18:54,679
merge into one

239
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:56,159
and lead the Demon Clan.

240
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:57,839
But in the end,

241
00:18:57,839 --> 00:18:59,879
you were awakened by your feelings.

242
00:19:00,520 --> 00:19:02,000
You can't kill us.

243
00:19:02,839 --> 00:19:04,439
Just wait to die.

244
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:17,359
Master.

245
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:32,839
Master!

246
00:19:36,199 --> 00:19:37,439
I didn't expect

247
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:42,280
to hear you call me Master again.

248
00:19:47,439 --> 00:19:48,240
Master.

249
00:19:48,879 --> 00:19:49,679
Master.

250
00:19:53,520 --> 00:19:54,560
Xueying,

251
00:19:56,119 --> 00:19:57,760
I pretended to join the Demon Clan

252
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:01,760
to protect the Xia Clan,

253
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,520
to protect everyone,

254
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:07,679
to protect my students.

255
00:20:12,800 --> 00:20:14,919
But my body was taken over by Da Er Hao.

256
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:19,159
Sooner or later,

257
00:20:20,639 --> 00:20:21,960
I won't be me anymore.

258
00:20:22,879 --> 00:20:23,679
Rather than

259
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:25,720
becoming a demon,

260
00:20:26,560 --> 00:20:28,679
I'd rather die as a Xia Clan member.

261
00:20:31,119 --> 00:20:32,240
Xueying,

262
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:34,720
seeing you like this now,

263
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:36,639
I'm really relieved.

264
00:20:37,119 --> 00:20:38,599
I once said

265
00:20:41,439 --> 00:20:43,599
that I would fight
against the Demon Clan with you.

266
00:20:47,320 --> 00:20:48,359
I'm sorry.

267
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,199
Did I break my word?

268
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:36,199
Xiaoxi, I'm sorry.

269
00:21:36,679 --> 00:21:38,280
Without your permission,

270
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:39,480
I'm going to stay here

271
00:21:39,480 --> 00:21:40,399
with you forever.

272
00:21:40,639 --> 00:21:41,879
You won't blame me, will you?

273
00:21:42,399 --> 00:21:43,359
Idiot,

274
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:45,280
how could I blame you?

275
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:47,599
I've been waiting for you.

276
00:22:08,639 --> 00:22:10,000
You humans

277
00:22:10,119 --> 00:22:12,320
have so complicated emotions.

278
00:22:13,040 --> 00:22:14,040
I really didn't want

279
00:22:14,040 --> 00:22:15,919
to meet you so soon.

280
00:22:17,199 --> 00:22:18,280
Your Lordship,

281
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:20,960
it's the final battle.

282
00:22:21,359 --> 00:22:22,760
We must not lose.

283
00:22:23,839 --> 00:22:25,639
I will do my best

284
00:22:26,080 --> 00:22:28,639
to help you.

286

Xueying.

287
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,119
This Ling Demonic Flower

288
00:23:13,119 --> 00:23:15,439
is the sacred flower of our clan.

289
00:23:15,919 --> 00:23:18,119
It feeds on Dou Qi.

290
00:23:18,560 --> 00:23:19,280
Once it finishes absorbing

291
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,119
the Dou Qi of you weaklings,

292
00:23:21,399 --> 00:23:22,879
Dongbo Xueying

293
00:23:22,879 --> 00:23:24,720
will die in this flower.

294
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,199
You deal with this demonic flower.

295
00:23:30,199 --> 00:23:31,439
I'll take care of Da Er Hao.

296
00:23:32,199 --> 00:23:33,599
How can you do it alone?

297
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:43,720
Puyang,

298
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,199
find a way to save my brother!

299
00:23:45,399 --> 00:23:46,439
Youyue, what should we do?

300
00:23:55,800 --> 00:23:57,119
This flower is incredibly sturdy,

301
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:58,679
and its core keeps changing.

302
00:23:58,839 --> 00:23:59,919
You attack

303
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:00,520
wherever I attack.

304
00:24:09,080 --> 00:24:09,839
Oh, no.

305
00:24:10,399 --> 00:24:11,359
I can't see outside,

306
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:13,159
and I can't move.

307
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:18,560
I can't use my Dou Qi.

308
00:24:18,919 --> 00:24:19,839
What should I do?

309
00:24:27,240 --> 00:24:28,199
What should I do?

310
00:24:59,000 --> 00:25:00,839
No, no.

311
00:25:01,199 --> 00:25:02,359
You can't be hurt.

No,

320
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,760
you'll lose your life.

321
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:35,040
There's no time left.

322
00:25:35,879 --> 00:25:37,480

It's okay now.

383
00:32:11,119 --> 00:32:11,800
It's okay.

384
00:32:12,040 --> 00:32:13,919
It's okay, Youyue.

385
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:15,159
Puyang Bo,

386
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:19,320
I'm sorry.

387
00:32:20,599 --> 00:32:21,720
I'm sorry.

388
00:32:23,240 --> 00:32:24,919
I can't accompany you anymore.

389
00:32:26,879 --> 00:32:27,520
Youyue,

390
00:32:27,919 --> 00:32:29,480
Youyue, don't talk nonsense.

391
00:32:29,679 --> 00:32:31,320
We will go home together.

392
00:32:31,480 --> 00:32:32,919
We will return
to the Dragon Mountain Empire together,

393
00:32:33,040 --> 00:32:34,439
and return to Changfeng Academy together.

394
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,480
We will practice

395
00:32:36,599 --> 00:32:37,839
and go eat delicious food together.

396
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,520
Okay?

397
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,320
You must guard

398
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:43,599
Changfeng Academy

399
00:32:43,760 --> 00:32:45,760
and our homeland.

400
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:48,560
You must live well

401
00:32:49,159 --> 00:32:50,439
and live a happy life.

402
00:32:58,560 --> 00:32:59,439
Youyue.

403
00:33:02,919 --> 00:33:03,720
Youyue.

404
00:34:01,119 --> 00:34:02,599
It's all over now.

405
00:34:03,679 --> 00:34:04,599
Now you are

406
00:34:04,599 --> 00:34:05,919
the hero of the Dragon Mountain Empire.

407
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:08,319
Hero.

408
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,040
When I was a child,

409
00:34:11,480 --> 00:34:12,639
I loved listening to my father

410
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:13,920
tell me stories about heroes.

411
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,239
Back then, I thought

412
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,040
heroes were out of reach.

413
00:34:18,599 --> 00:34:19,719
It was pride.

414
00:34:20,360 --> 00:34:21,360
It was an honor.

415
00:34:23,360 --> 00:34:24,840
But now I realize

416
00:34:25,719 --> 00:34:27,080
the word "hero"

417
00:34:28,599 --> 00:34:30,159
is made up

418
00:34:30,159 --> 00:34:31,080
of the blood

419
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:32,239
of all those ordinary people

420
00:34:32,799 --> 00:34:34,239
who sacrifice in silence.

421
00:34:35,119 --> 00:34:36,279
If you were separated

422
00:34:37,239 --> 00:34:39,159
from your own parents,

423
00:34:39,759 --> 00:34:41,199
would you feel sad?

424
00:34:41,360 --> 00:34:43,000
But it's not a person.

425
00:34:43,239 --> 00:34:45,199
It's just an animal.

426
00:34:46,920 --> 00:34:48,520
No matter if it's a human or an animal,

427
00:34:49,400 --> 00:34:50,520
they are both living beings.

428
00:34:51,679 --> 00:34:53,560
And they both long
for the warmth of a family.

429
00:34:54,040 --> 00:34:55,639
Today is the Lucky Reunion Festival.

430
00:34:56,440 --> 00:34:58,360
You are with your parents,

431
00:34:58,799 --> 00:35:01,880
but you let the wolf cub
leave its parents.

432
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:04,880
Do you think what you're doing is right?

433
00:35:05,239 --> 00:35:06,799
But if it lives with us

434
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:08,920
after I brought it back,

435
00:35:09,239 --> 00:35:11,199
doesn't it mean it has a new home?

436
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,080
Back then, the Dragon Mountain Emperor

437
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,960
(Xueying Territory)
created the Dragon Mountain.

438
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:17,639
(Xueying Territory)

439
00:35:17,639 --> 00:35:18,679
(We, the Xia Clan,)

440
00:35:18,679 --> 00:35:19,719
(do not thrive)

441
00:35:19,719 --> 00:35:20,799
(through the slaughter)

442
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:22,880
(and pillaging of other races.)

443
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:25,560
(Great love comes from protection.)

444
00:35:25,759 --> 00:35:27,520
(Only by protecting the weak)

445
00:35:27,920 --> 00:35:29,239
(can one fulfill oneself)

446
00:35:29,360 --> 00:35:31,159
(and gain more supporters.)

447
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:32,679
(You'll understand these truths)

448
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,400
(in the future.)

449
00:36:08,920 --> 00:36:09,920
(Only when you have the responsibility)

450
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:11,040
(and commitment to protect others)

451
00:36:11,759 --> 00:36:13,159
(will you achieve yourself)

452
00:36:13,159 --> 00:36:14,119
(on the path of cultivation.)

453
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:16,000
(Father,)

454
00:36:16,639 --> 00:36:18,480
(today, I finally understand)

455
00:36:19,159 --> 00:36:20,799
(the truths you told me ten years ago.)

456
00:36:22,119 --> 00:36:22,759
Let's go.

457
00:36:23,880 --> 00:36:25,040
Go where?

458
00:36:25,239 --> 00:36:26,679
Of course, back to the Snow Stone Fort.

459
00:36:27,639 --> 00:36:29,239
Madam of the Xueying Territory.

460
00:36:45,614 --> 00:36:48,400
(10 years later)

461
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:49,520

462
00:36:49,639 --> 00:36:50,840

I'm treating everyone to a meal.

Do you guys have source stones here?

469
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:01,599
Bro, we do have source stones.

470
00:37:01,679 --> 00:37:02,360
But you see,

471
00:37:02,360 --> 00:37:03,119
we're closing

472

473
00:37:04,199 --> 00:37:05,279
What's more important, making money

474
00:37:05,279 --> 00:37:06,199
or celebrating the festival?

475
00:37:06,400 --> 00:37:07,679
How can you do business like this?

476
00:37:07,719 --> 00:37:08,319

477
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:09,000

482

00:41:31,560 --> 00:41:33,000
(like the palm of my hand.)

566
00:41:33,000 --> 00:41:34,679
(Every night, I would pester
my mother to tell me about them.)

567
00:41:35,639 --> 00:41:36,719
(My father told me)

568
00:41:37,719 --> 00:41:39,319
(in places we can't see,)

569
00:41:39,840 --> 00:41:41,639
(there are many nameless heroes)

570
00:41:41,960 --> 00:41:44,080
(all protecting this land.)

571
00:41:44,679 --> 00:41:45,679
(This is the belief and mission)

572
00:41:45,679 --> 00:41:47,759
(of every one of us in the Xia Clan.)

573
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:49,799
(It is also our glory.)

574
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:51,799
(I asked my father)

575
00:41:52,239 --> 00:41:53,319
(how to get)

576
00:41:53,319 --> 00:41:54,279
(Transcendent power.)

577
00:41:55,199 --> 00:41:56,000
(He told me)

578
00:41:57,000 --> 00:42:00,119
(Snow Eagle Lord)
(the path is right under our feet.)

579
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:03,119
(As long as you believe in yourself,)

580
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,679
(you have already embarked
on the journey.)
