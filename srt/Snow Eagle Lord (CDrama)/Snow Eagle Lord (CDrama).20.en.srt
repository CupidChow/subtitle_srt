you still have such grace and elegance.

You really live up to your reputation.

What do you want me to do?

25
00:01:59,558 --> 00:02:01,278
I want you to go with me to a place.

26
00:02:01,597 --> 00:02:02,397
Where?

27
00:02:02,558 --> 00:02:03,597
Don't ask

28
00:02:03,718 --> 00:02:05,078
what you shouldn't.

29
00:02:06,758 --> 00:02:08,117
I can help you,

30
00:02:09,717 --> 00:02:10,318
but you absolutely

31
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:11,677
cannot harm my disciples.

00:02:12,358 --> 00:02:14,438

Dongbo Xueying

34
00:02:17,277 --> 00:02:18,598
is meaningless to me.

35
00:02:19,797 --> 00:02:21,557
As long as you behave,

36
00:02:22,158 --> 00:02:23,478
I promise you

37
00:02:26,237 --> 00:02:27,957
he will be safe and sound.

00:02:31,929 --> 00:02:33,368
(Changfeng Academy)

40
00:02:52,957 --> 00:02:53,997
I drank too much.

41
00:02:54,758 --> 00:02:55,557
Xueying,

42
00:02:55,758 --> 00:02:56,677
Xueying.

43
00:02:58,397 --> 00:02:59,318
Wake up.

44
00:03:00,397 --> 00:03:01,358
Puyang Bo.

45
00:03:08,717 --> 00:03:09,717
After the matter

46
00:03:09,717 --> 00:03:10,677
was cleared up,

47
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:12,997
I feel much lighter all over.

48
00:03:13,677 --> 00:03:15,237
I used to have
a stabbing pain in my back,

49
00:03:15,318 --> 00:03:16,237
but now it seems

50
00:03:16,277 --> 00:03:17,078
to disappear.

51
00:03:17,557 --> 00:03:19,638
You ought to thank the dean's fine wine.

52
00:03:19,717 --> 00:03:20,918
Wine with a fine feast

53
00:03:20,918 --> 00:03:22,438
makes the day divine indeed.

54
00:03:25,517 --> 00:03:26,237
Oh, right.

55
00:03:26,598 --> 00:03:27,358
Where is Master?

56
00:03:28,438 --> 00:03:29,397
I don't know.

57
00:03:29,478 --> 00:03:30,397
I guess you were too sleepy

58
00:03:30,397 --> 00:03:31,158
for him to wake you up,

59
00:03:31,158 --> 00:03:31,878
so he left first.

60
00:03:31,957 --> 00:03:34,038
You think everyone is like you?

61
00:03:34,918 --> 00:03:36,557
He might have had something to do.

62
00:03:36,557 --> 00:03:37,557
Let's go back too.

63
00:03:40,837 --> 00:03:41,397
(There is)

64
00:03:41,397 --> 00:03:42,598
(one more important thing to do.)

65
00:03:43,237 --> 00:03:43,918
Brother,

66
00:03:44,717 --> 00:03:45,397
Brother.

67
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,867
(To Dongbo Qingshi)

68
00:04:10,954 --> 00:04:13,022
(From Tong San of the Snow Stone Fort)

69
00:04:23,597 --> 00:04:24,517
Qingshi,

70
00:04:25,238 --> 00:04:26,238
you're leaving?

71
00:04:26,357 --> 00:04:27,678
If my brother comes back later,

72
00:04:27,678 --> 00:04:28,758
give him a message for me

73
00:04:28,917 --> 00:04:29,998
and tell him I'll go back
to the Snow Stone Fort.

74
00:04:34,782 --> 00:04:37,008
(Moyang's Fort)

75
00:04:39,277 --> 00:04:39,837
(Mother,)

76
00:04:40,157 --> 00:04:41,558
(I've become Transcendent.)

77
00:04:41,758 --> 00:04:42,638
(I'm coming to save you.)

78
00:04:42,678 --> 00:04:43,638
Same as last time.

79
00:04:43,638 --> 00:04:44,477
So many guards.

80
00:04:44,678 --> 00:04:45,238
It's alright.

81
00:04:45,318 --> 00:04:45,957
I have a way.

82
00:04:46,037 --> 00:04:46,998
I'll lure them away.

83
00:04:52,397 --> 00:04:53,357

00:08:26,917 --> 00:08:28,477

133
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:25,678
Who is that masked man?

134
00:09:25,678 --> 00:09:26,757
He is

135
00:09:26,877 --> 00:09:28,398
the one Xueying and I met

136
00:09:28,398 --> 00:09:29,438
at the Black Wind Cliff.

137
00:09:29,957 --> 00:09:31,597
So Moyang Chen also colludes

138
00:09:31,597 --> 00:09:32,357
with the Demon Clan?

139
00:09:32,357 --> 00:09:33,678
(For ten years,)

140
00:09:33,997 --> 00:09:35,438
(I thought
the family catastrophe back then)

141
00:09:35,518 --> 00:09:37,477
(was due to
the Moyang family's grudges.)

142
00:09:37,837 --> 00:09:39,558
(But now it seems
everything is not that simple.)

143
00:09:40,038 --> 00:09:40,877
(I must find out)

144
00:09:40,877 --> 00:09:42,078
(the whole truth.)

145
00:09:46,117 --> 00:09:46,757
Look,

146
00:09:46,798 --> 00:09:47,757
what is this?

147
00:09:53,051 --> 00:09:56,315
(Changfeng Academy)

148
00:09:57,398 --> 00:09:58,038
This is

149
00:09:58,438 --> 00:09:59,757
what fell off

150
00:09:59,757 --> 00:10:00,877
that masked man.

151
00:10:01,158 --> 00:10:02,357
I always feel like

152
00:10:02,518 --> 00:10:04,078
I've seen it somewhere.

153
00:10:15,158 --> 00:10:16,278
At the Black Wind Cliff?

154
00:10:18,357 --> 00:10:19,078
No.

155
00:10:32,038 --> 00:10:32,798
Jingqiu,

156
00:10:32,918 --> 00:10:33,438
we can't

157
00:10:33,438 --> 00:10:34,158
go in here.

158
00:10:34,278 --> 00:10:35,398
Let's go and play somewhere else.

159
00:10:35,438 --> 00:10:36,357
Be good.

160
00:10:38,198 --> 00:10:39,918
This should be something
from the Xinhuo Palace.

161
00:10:40,438 --> 00:10:41,117
Xinhuo Palace.

162
00:10:41,117 --> 00:10:42,357
- Xinhuo Palace.
- Xinhuo Palace.

163
00:10:42,357 --> 00:10:42,837
Right.

164
00:10:43,558 --> 00:10:45,038
I remember when I was young,

165
00:10:45,318 --> 00:10:46,877
I went with my Faction Leader
to the Xinhuo Palace

166
00:10:46,877 --> 00:10:47,957
for the Council Conference.

167
00:10:48,438 --> 00:10:49,398
I accidentally broke

168
00:10:49,398 --> 00:10:50,997
into their core chamber.

169
00:10:51,198 --> 00:10:52,278
At that time,

170
00:10:52,637 --> 00:10:53,198
I saw

171
00:10:53,198 --> 00:10:54,558
a blue crystal ball.

172
00:10:54,877 --> 00:10:56,198
The appearance of that

173
00:10:56,438 --> 00:10:57,798
looks exactly like this.

174
00:10:58,237 --> 00:10:59,597
So

175
00:10:59,678 --> 00:11:01,997
the Xinhuo Palace
and the Demon Clan are related too.

176
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:04,318
The Xinhuo Palace
is the most heavily fortified

177
00:11:04,318 --> 00:11:05,278
by the Xia Clan.

178
00:11:05,318 --> 00:11:06,798
How did the Demon Clan infiltrate it?

179
00:11:08,918 --> 00:11:09,837
- Could there be a demon spy
- Could there be a demon spy

180
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,278
- inside the Xinhuo Palace?
- inside the Xinhuo Palace?

181
00:11:12,278 --> 00:11:13,237
He is probably

182
00:11:13,398 --> 00:11:14,837
using a righteous identity

183
00:11:15,038 --> 00:11:16,717
as a disguise.

184
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,278
Why don't we go ask the Faction Leader

185
00:11:19,278 --> 00:11:20,398
or Dean Changfeng?

186
00:11:20,597 --> 00:11:22,438
If one of them

187
00:11:22,438 --> 00:11:23,757
is the masked man

188
00:11:23,757 --> 00:11:25,078
or the spy,

189
00:11:25,078 --> 00:11:25,957
what should we do?

190
00:11:26,078 --> 00:11:27,278
There is indeed such a possibility.

191
00:11:27,637 --> 00:11:28,357
I've fought with that masked man

192
00:11:28,357 --> 00:11:29,198
several times.

193
00:11:29,357 --> 00:11:30,438
He's very skilled.

194
00:11:30,837 --> 00:11:31,477
He could be

195
00:11:31,477 --> 00:11:32,757
any one of the people around us,

196
00:11:33,117 --> 00:11:34,597
so we can't act recklessly.

197
00:11:34,798 --> 00:11:36,078
What should we do then?

198
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,198
We can't test him,

199
00:11:37,198 --> 00:11:38,518
and we can't beat them.

200
00:11:38,637 --> 00:11:39,637
Anyway,

201
00:11:39,637 --> 00:11:41,198
this is an important clue.

202
00:11:41,278 --> 00:11:42,237
We must hurry

203
00:11:42,237 --> 00:11:43,957
and follow this clue.

204
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,357
If that masked man

205
00:11:45,357 --> 00:11:46,798
is really hiding in the Xinhuo Palace.

206
00:11:46,918 --> 00:11:48,678
The Xia Clan is already very unsafe.

207
00:11:49,438 --> 00:11:50,237
It seems

208
00:11:50,798 --> 00:11:52,198
I have to go to the Xinhuo Palace

209
00:11:52,477 --> 00:11:53,518
to continue the investigation.

210
00:11:53,798 --> 00:11:54,918
You can't go to the Xinhuo Palace now,

211
00:11:54,918 --> 00:11:55,558
can you?

212
00:11:55,558 --> 00:11:57,237
You haven't joined
a Transcendent organization yet.

213
00:11:58,997 --> 00:12:00,757
It's difficult to join
the Xinhuo Palace.

214
00:12:01,078 --> 00:12:01,798
Becoming Transcendent

215
00:12:01,798 --> 00:12:03,078
is far from enough.

216
00:12:03,558 --> 00:12:04,997
Usually, people have to practice
in a Transcendent faction

217
00:12:04,997 --> 00:12:06,278
for some time,

218
00:12:06,278 --> 00:12:07,637
enhance their Transcendent strength,

219
00:12:07,637 --> 00:12:09,078
break through the Hundred-Battle Chamber

220
00:12:09,158 --> 00:12:10,518
and have their strength recognized

221
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:12,278
before having the chance
to join the Xinhuo Palace.

222
00:12:12,837 --> 00:12:13,198
You are now

223
00:12:13,198 --> 00:12:14,597
Transcendent,

224
00:12:14,717 --> 00:12:16,357
but to break through
the Hundred-Battle Chamber

225
00:12:16,398 --> 00:12:17,757
is very difficult

226
00:12:17,757 --> 00:12:18,678
for you now.

227
00:12:18,798 --> 00:12:20,198
No matter how difficult, I have to try.

228
00:12:21,438 --> 00:12:22,357
This concerns the safety of my mother

229
00:12:22,357 --> 00:12:23,717
and the entire Xia Clan.

230
00:12:24,357 --> 00:12:24,837
Even if there's only

231
00:12:24,837 --> 00:12:25,997
a one in ten thousand chance,

232
00:12:26,318 --> 00:12:26,637
I will

233
00:12:26,637 --> 00:12:28,117
exhaust all my efforts
and try everything.

234
00:12:28,877 --> 00:12:29,518
I can't afford

235
00:12:29,518 --> 00:12:30,877
to practice slowly for a few more years.

236
00:12:31,438 --> 00:12:32,198
Every day that goes by

237
00:12:32,318 --> 00:12:33,237
increases the risk
my mother and the Xia Clan

238
00:12:33,237 --> 00:12:34,438
will face.

239
00:12:35,678 --> 00:12:36,438
But,

240
00:12:36,798 --> 00:12:37,597
I can't tell the council

241
00:12:37,597 --> 00:12:38,798
about this matter.

242
00:12:39,078 --> 00:12:40,597
I can only rely on my own strength.

243
00:12:42,158 --> 00:12:43,357
I have

244
00:12:43,357 --> 00:12:44,438
no other way.

245
00:12:44,957 --> 00:12:46,318
Let's go ask the Faction Leader.

246
00:12:46,318 --> 00:12:47,438
Maybe he knows.

247
00:12:47,678 --> 00:12:48,237
Alright.

248
00:12:56,798 --> 00:12:57,757
Faction Leader.

249
00:13:03,398 --> 00:13:04,837
What happened?

250
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,038
Master Sikong,

251
00:13:06,757 --> 00:13:07,477
I've been Transcendent

252
00:13:07,477 --> 00:13:08,398
for some time,

253
00:13:08,558 --> 00:13:09,357
but I haven't joined

254
00:13:09,357 --> 00:13:10,678
any Transcendent organization.

255
00:13:10,997 --> 00:13:12,637
I want to join the Water Daoist Temple,

256
00:13:12,918 --> 00:13:13,997
but I have a request.

257
00:13:14,597 --> 00:13:16,438
You want to join my temple,

258
00:13:16,438 --> 00:13:17,957
and you want to make conditions with me?

259
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:19,078
Faction Leader,

260
00:13:19,158 --> 00:13:20,678
Xueying doesn't mean that.

261
00:13:20,678 --> 00:13:21,038
He is just...

262
00:13:21,038 --> 00:13:21,678
I know

263
00:13:21,997 --> 00:13:23,597
usually, one can only
join the Xinhuo Palace

264
00:13:23,597 --> 00:13:24,877
after practicing for some time

265
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,438
in a Transcendent organization.

266
00:13:27,237 --> 00:13:28,957
I know it's unreasonable,

267
00:13:29,597 --> 00:13:30,717
but would it be possible

268
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:32,717
for me to join the Xinhuo Palace now?

269
00:13:33,877 --> 00:13:36,237
You want to join the Xinhuo Palace now?

270
00:13:36,918 --> 00:13:38,318
Do you have the ability?

271
00:13:38,357 --> 00:13:39,078
I know.

272
00:13:39,798 --> 00:13:40,678
For now,

273
00:13:40,678 --> 00:13:41,798
I don't have the ability.

274
00:13:42,717 --> 00:13:44,357
But my mother was taken away
by the Demon Clan.

275
00:13:44,438 --> 00:13:45,717
The Xinhuo Palace is the strongest force

276
00:13:45,717 --> 00:13:46,757
against the Demon Clan.

277
00:13:46,918 --> 00:13:48,038
I want to join the Xinhuo Palace

278
00:13:48,278 --> 00:13:49,637
to find the Demon Clan's base

279
00:13:49,637 --> 00:13:50,518
and save my mother.

280
00:13:51,398 --> 00:13:52,518
You mean

281
00:13:53,038 --> 00:13:54,237
Moyang Yu

282
00:13:54,237 --> 00:13:55,678
was taken away by the Demon Clan?

283
00:13:55,837 --> 00:13:56,398
Yes.

284
00:13:56,837 --> 00:13:58,237
When I was about to rescue my mother,

285
00:13:58,477 --> 00:14:00,038
a masked man suddenly appeared.

286
00:14:00,237 --> 00:14:01,038
He

287
00:14:01,198 --> 00:14:02,637
took away Moyang Chen and my mother.

288
00:14:31,877 --> 00:14:32,997
Now I see.

289
00:14:33,117 --> 00:14:34,078
Moyang Chen locked up your mother

290
00:14:34,078 --> 00:14:35,117
for so many years,

291
00:14:35,318 --> 00:14:35,678
and it was not

292
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:37,357
just a Moyang family affair

293
00:14:37,558 --> 00:14:38,438
but

294
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:39,678
a part

295
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:40,597
of the Demon Clan's plan.

296
00:14:42,078 --> 00:14:43,278
They must have done it

297
00:14:43,278 --> 00:14:44,597
for the Ancient Bloodline.

298
00:14:45,357 --> 00:14:46,477
The Ancient Bloodline?

299
00:14:46,477 --> 00:14:47,078
Yes.

300
00:14:47,637 --> 00:14:48,918
The Ancient Bloodline

301
00:14:48,918 --> 00:14:50,798
is the only power
that can threaten gods.

302
00:14:51,318 --> 00:14:52,798
Your mother possesses the power.

303
00:14:53,198 --> 00:14:53,997
Now,

304
00:14:53,997 --> 00:14:55,158
she's been taken away by the Demon Clan,

305
00:14:55,198 --> 00:14:56,918
and it's not looking too promising.

306
00:14:57,518 --> 00:14:58,318
Faction Leader,

307
00:14:58,678 --> 00:15:00,038
Moyang Chen colluded with the Demon Clan

308
00:15:00,038 --> 00:15:00,997
and harmed the people of the Xia Clan.

309
00:15:00,997 --> 00:15:02,158
We can't let him go.

310
00:15:02,678 --> 00:15:03,518
I will discuss this matter

311
00:15:03,518 --> 00:15:05,117
with the Council

312
00:15:05,357 --> 00:15:07,278
and have the Dragon Mountain Mansion
issue a wanted order

313
00:15:07,477 --> 00:15:09,318
and the whole city hunt him down.

314
00:15:10,078 --> 00:15:11,637
We will not

315
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:12,798
tolerate the traitor.

316
00:15:13,357 --> 00:15:14,318
(I must find)

317
00:15:14,318 --> 00:15:15,518
(the demon spy hidden)

318
00:15:15,518 --> 00:15:16,678
(in the Xinhuo Palace.)

319
00:15:18,237 --> 00:15:19,558
Master Sikong, please

320
00:15:20,038 --> 00:15:21,678
help me join
the Xinhuo Palace immediately.

321
00:15:22,078 --> 00:15:24,438
The admission test
of Xinhuo Palace is very strict.

322
00:15:24,518 --> 00:15:26,477
You must break through
the Hundred-Battle Chamber.

323
00:15:26,597 --> 00:15:27,518
Only in this way can it show

324
00:15:27,518 --> 00:15:28,997
you have great strength

325
00:15:29,518 --> 00:15:31,678
and are qualified
to join the Xinhuo Palace.

326
00:15:32,757 --> 00:15:34,158
Can I give it a try now?

327
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,117
Do you know?

328
00:15:39,477 --> 00:15:40,198
To be qualified

329
00:15:40,198 --> 00:15:41,798
to break through
the Hundred-Battle Chamber,

330
00:15:41,798 --> 00:15:43,558
you must practice

331
00:15:43,558 --> 00:15:44,398
for several years

332
00:15:44,398 --> 00:15:45,597
in a Transcendent organization,

333
00:15:45,597 --> 00:15:46,518
get promoted

334
00:15:46,518 --> 00:15:48,637
and be the mainstay
of Transcendent cultivators.

335
00:15:48,877 --> 00:15:50,198
Only then will you have
a chance of winning.

336
00:15:50,237 --> 00:15:51,038
Otherwise,

337
00:15:51,198 --> 00:15:52,717
it can be life-threatening.

338
00:15:53,957 --> 00:15:55,438
The resources for cultivation
of the Xinhuo Palace

339
00:15:55,438 --> 00:15:56,558
are very scarce.

340
00:15:56,637 --> 00:15:57,278
Cultivators

341
00:15:57,278 --> 00:15:58,717
must have great abilities

342
00:15:58,798 --> 00:15:59,877
to pass

343
00:16:00,078 --> 00:16:01,637
the stringent test.

344
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,117
You just became Transcendent.

345
00:16:04,757 --> 00:16:06,318
I don't think you're strong enough.

346
00:16:08,158 --> 00:16:09,678
Please let me try.

347
00:16:10,237 --> 00:16:11,078
Faction Leader,

348
00:16:11,158 --> 00:16:12,558
please help Xueying.

349
00:16:12,597 --> 00:16:13,318
Yeah.

350
00:16:13,637 --> 00:16:14,997
Let Xueying give it a try.

351
00:16:55,477 --> 00:16:57,398
Dongbo Xueying.

352
00:16:59,438 --> 00:17:00,837
He's actually stronger

353
00:17:00,837 --> 00:17:02,798
than me?

354
00:17:03,278 --> 00:17:04,758
When he fought with me back then,

355
00:17:04,837 --> 00:17:06,357
he was just a naive young lad.

356
00:17:06,998 --> 00:17:09,038
I didn't take him seriously at all.

357
00:17:09,437 --> 00:17:10,917
If I had known,

358
00:17:11,318 --> 00:17:13,357
I would have crippled him back then.

359
00:17:18,038 --> 00:17:19,758
Dongbo Xueying
is the only new Transcendent Knight

360
00:17:19,758 --> 00:17:21,558
from Changfeng Academy.

361
00:17:21,958 --> 00:17:23,998
He could throw off the shackles
of the Soul Scouring Nail

362
00:17:23,998 --> 00:17:25,798
and break open Chi Qiubai's barrier.

363
00:17:26,437 --> 00:17:28,998
He is not to be underestimated.

364
00:17:31,637 --> 00:17:32,998
I can't put up with this.

365
00:17:33,117 --> 00:17:34,837
I will kill Dongbo Xueying.

366
00:17:34,837 --> 00:17:35,998
Don't touch him.

367
00:17:36,197 --> 00:17:38,197
I have a use for the man.

368
00:17:38,197 --> 00:17:38,397
I...

369
00:17:38,397 --> 00:17:40,197
This time I saved you
with my demonic technique

370
00:17:40,637 --> 00:17:42,318
and took Moyang Yu away.

371
00:17:42,837 --> 00:17:44,718
The righteous people
will definitely target you.

372
00:17:44,837 --> 00:17:46,558
You have to be careful.

373
00:17:47,117 --> 00:17:49,278
I'm the master of Moyang's Fort,

374
00:17:50,157 --> 00:17:52,197
but I was thrashed

375
00:17:52,518 --> 00:17:54,397
by Dongbo Xueying.

376
00:17:55,478 --> 00:17:57,677
I can't go back to Moyang's Fort

377
00:17:58,117 --> 00:17:59,798
and have to hide

378
00:18:00,278 --> 00:18:02,318
in the Destruction Mountain Range.

379
00:18:04,478 --> 00:18:06,397
I've already paid too much

380
00:18:06,998 --> 00:18:08,917
to be stronger than others.

381
00:18:10,117 --> 00:18:11,637
There's no way back.

382
00:18:12,078 --> 00:18:13,437
As long as you complete

383
00:18:13,437 --> 00:18:14,837
the tasks we gave you,

384
00:18:14,877 --> 00:18:15,798
we'll make it

385
00:18:15,798 --> 00:18:17,478
worth your while.

386
00:18:20,837 --> 00:18:22,238
This is the second volume

387
00:18:22,238 --> 00:18:23,157
of the high-level demonic techniques.

388
00:18:23,758 --> 00:18:25,397
Your injuries are still unstable.

389
00:18:25,397 --> 00:18:26,917
It's a good time to practice it.

390
00:18:32,157 --> 00:18:33,318
Now,

391
00:18:33,837 --> 00:18:34,917
it's time for you

392
00:18:34,917 --> 00:18:36,238
to make a choice

393
00:18:36,238 --> 00:18:37,958
between righteousness and evil.

394
00:18:39,078 --> 00:18:41,397
Between righteousness and evil?

395
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:42,958
What does it mean?

396
00:18:43,117 --> 00:18:44,478
Practicing demonic techniques

397
00:18:44,558 --> 00:18:46,197
can make you

398
00:18:46,238 --> 00:18:47,677
advance rapidly in a short period,

399
00:18:47,677 --> 00:18:49,437
but when you reach a certain stage,

400
00:18:49,437 --> 00:18:50,917
the righteous and demonic energies

401
00:18:50,917 --> 00:18:52,758
in your body will conflict.

402
00:18:53,278 --> 00:18:54,637
If you don't choose to disperse

403
00:18:54,637 --> 00:18:56,157
the righteous energy,

404
00:18:56,437 --> 00:18:57,518
you won't continue

405
00:18:57,518 --> 00:18:59,917
to improve in demonic techniques.

406
00:19:00,318 --> 00:19:02,478
If I don't,

407
00:19:02,758 --> 00:19:03,558
then what will happen?

408
00:19:03,718 --> 00:19:04,917
It will backfire.

409
00:19:05,397 --> 00:19:06,637
You will become

410
00:19:06,677 --> 00:19:09,038
half-human and half-demon.

411
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:11,287
(Demonic Fire)

412
00:19:21,758 --> 00:19:22,478
I...

413
00:19:23,677 --> 00:19:24,437
I...

414
00:19:24,597 --> 00:19:26,677
Do I have a choice?

415
00:19:27,518 --> 00:19:28,478
Ever since

416
00:19:29,078 --> 00:19:31,038
I was expelled
from the Black White Deity Mountain,

417
00:19:31,038 --> 00:19:33,157
I've been no longer
on the side of righteousness.

418
00:19:33,597 --> 00:19:35,718
Although I am the master
of Moyang's Fort,

419
00:19:36,437 --> 00:19:38,357
the stain

420
00:19:38,718 --> 00:19:40,478
will follow me for the rest of my life.

421
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,837
I don't need to make any choice.

422
00:19:44,318 --> 00:19:46,437
They force me.

423
00:19:49,558 --> 00:19:50,278
I just do

424
00:19:50,278 --> 00:19:52,278
what's in my best interest.

425
00:19:52,998 --> 00:19:54,758
You're a smart man.

426
00:19:55,157 --> 00:19:56,518
Cooperating with us

427
00:19:56,518 --> 00:19:57,998
won't make you at a loss.

428
00:19:58,437 --> 00:19:59,397
In two days,

429
00:19:59,558 --> 00:20:01,318
Second Priest will come to meet you.

430
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:04,278
These days, I want you

431
00:20:05,117 --> 00:20:07,157
to hold onto Moyang Yu.

432
00:20:07,478 --> 00:20:09,998
She is very important to our clan.

433
00:20:10,318 --> 00:20:11,718
High Priest, don't worry.

434
00:20:12,078 --> 00:20:13,078
With me here,

435
00:20:13,518 --> 00:20:14,958
there will be no mistakes.

436
00:20:26,409 --> 00:20:28,171
(Demonic Fire)

437
00:21:06,478 --> 00:21:07,478
Wait, wait.

438
00:21:07,478 --> 00:21:08,437
D-D-Don't kill me.

439
00:21:08,437 --> 00:21:08,877
I have money.

440
00:21:08,877 --> 00:21:10,718
A-A-All to you.

441
00:21:19,718 --> 00:21:21,197
Uncle Zong Ling, Uncle Tong San,

442
00:21:21,558 --> 00:21:22,437
I'm back.

443
00:21:22,597 --> 00:21:23,157
Qingshi is back.

444
00:21:23,157 --> 00:21:24,197
Qingshi is back.

445
00:21:24,397 --> 00:21:26,478
(One thing after another.)

446
00:21:26,718 --> 00:21:28,318
(How come he's back now?)

447
00:21:29,197 --> 00:21:29,558
Why do you

448
00:21:29,558 --> 00:21:31,197
want to let Ji Rong's father leave?

449
00:21:31,758 --> 00:21:33,318
She has been an orphan for so many years

450
00:21:33,597 --> 00:21:34,357
and finally found

451
00:21:34,357 --> 00:21:35,637
her biological father.

452
00:21:36,278 --> 00:21:37,038
Uncle Tong San,

453
00:21:37,157 --> 00:21:37,958
Uncle Zong,

454
00:21:38,197 --> 00:21:39,798
you don't know Ji Rong at all.

455
00:21:40,238 --> 00:21:40,958
Back then,

456
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:41,958
my brother had an accident,

457
00:21:41,958 --> 00:21:43,558
and it was Ji Rong who stayed with me

458
00:21:43,558 --> 00:21:44,357
and took care of me.

459
00:21:44,718 --> 00:21:46,117
I really trust her.

460
00:21:46,798 --> 00:21:48,518
Just let her father stay.

461
00:21:51,558 --> 00:21:52,518
Qingshi.

462
00:21:53,677 --> 00:21:54,357
Rong.

463
00:21:57,197 --> 00:21:57,677
You're back.

464
00:21:57,677 --> 00:21:58,078
You...

465
00:21:58,117 --> 00:21:59,597
Did the Transcendent Trial end?

466
00:22:00,758 --> 00:22:01,718
It's over.

467
00:22:02,078 --> 00:22:02,877
But

468
00:22:02,877 --> 00:22:04,397
I didn't become Transcendent.

469
00:22:04,998 --> 00:22:05,958
It's okay.

470
00:22:06,357 --> 00:22:07,117
Isn't the trial

471
00:22:07,117 --> 00:22:08,718
held once every three years?

472
00:22:08,718 --> 00:22:09,998
You can participate again in the future.

473
00:22:09,998 --> 00:22:11,117
You will definitely make progress.

474
00:22:12,518 --> 00:22:14,238
Thank you for your encouragement, Rong.

475
00:22:14,677 --> 00:22:15,238
After these days' hard work,

476
00:22:15,238 --> 00:22:16,278
you must be tired.

477
00:22:16,278 --> 00:22:17,518
I'll make you something delicious.

478
00:22:17,518 --> 00:22:18,518
What do you want to eat?

479
00:22:18,718 --> 00:22:19,637
No, thanks.

480
00:22:20,078 --> 00:22:21,038
After seeing you,

481
00:22:21,357 --> 00:22:22,837
I'm actually very happy.

482
00:22:24,837 --> 00:22:25,798
By the way, Rong,

483
00:22:26,157 --> 00:22:27,078
I hear your father

484
00:22:27,078 --> 00:22:28,637
has been staying
at the Snow Stone Fort these days.

485
00:22:30,478 --> 00:22:32,238
My father likes to travel around,

486
00:22:32,238 --> 00:22:33,677
so he won't stay for long.

487
00:22:33,877 --> 00:22:35,278
He told me yesterday
that he wanted to leave.

488
00:22:35,278 --> 00:22:36,278
I guess

489
00:22:36,278 --> 00:22:37,437
he must have left already.

490
00:22:37,837 --> 00:22:39,278
Someone was after him,

491
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:40,397
and he disappeared.

492
00:22:40,518 --> 00:22:41,278
What?

493
00:22:41,518 --> 00:22:42,318
Someone was after him?

494
00:22:42,637 --> 00:22:43,478
Is he alright?

495
00:22:43,478 --> 00:22:44,397
Where is he?

496
00:22:47,677 --> 00:22:48,238
Don't catch me!

497
00:22:48,718 --> 00:22:49,318
Save me!

498
00:22:52,357 --> 00:22:53,518
Don't catch me!

499
00:22:54,278 --> 00:22:55,558
Let go of me!

500
00:22:57,998 --> 00:22:59,117
He's used to it.

501
00:22:59,437 --> 00:23:00,837
It must be his debtors.

502
00:23:00,837 --> 00:23:01,597
They always appear

503
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,038
to want him dead,

504
00:23:03,518 --> 00:23:05,197
but they're not actually going
to take his life.

505
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:07,197
Alright.

506
00:23:07,278 --> 00:23:07,958
I wanted

507
00:23:07,958 --> 00:23:09,238
to have a meal with him.

508
00:23:09,758 --> 00:23:10,518
It's okay.

509
00:23:10,518 --> 00:23:11,677
There will be a chance in the future.

510
00:23:13,157 --> 00:23:13,837
Let's go.

511
00:23:13,958 --> 00:23:15,278
Let's go eat something delicious.

512
00:23:16,558 --> 00:23:16,998
What?

513
00:23:17,078 --> 00:23:17,597
What?

514
00:23:17,877 --> 00:23:19,637
D-D-Don't you scold them?

515
00:23:22,558 --> 00:23:23,758
Shi.

516
00:23:39,478 --> 00:23:40,798
This is the entrance barrier

517
00:23:40,798 --> 00:23:42,078
built by the Elders.

518
00:23:42,597 --> 00:23:44,437
Inject your Dou Qi into it

519
00:23:44,877 --> 00:23:45,837
and then let it

520
00:23:45,837 --> 00:23:47,558
break open

521
00:23:47,877 --> 00:23:49,478
the barrier.

522
00:23:49,958 --> 00:23:51,637
This is a test of strength

523
00:23:51,758 --> 00:23:53,718
to enter the Hundred-Battle Chamber.

524
00:23:54,397 --> 00:23:56,157
If you can open this barrier

525
00:23:56,157 --> 00:23:57,157
on your own,

526
00:23:57,278 --> 00:23:58,917
I'll allow you in.

527
00:23:59,518 --> 00:24:01,278
If you can't,

528
00:24:01,278 --> 00:24:02,478
even if you manage to get in,

529
00:24:03,357 --> 00:24:04,478
you'll still die.

530
00:24:17,197 --> 00:24:19,038
I give you this opportunity

531
00:24:19,197 --> 00:24:20,798
because you're filial,

532
00:24:20,958 --> 00:24:22,437
brave and persistent.

533
00:24:22,518 --> 00:24:24,518
But at the same time,
I want you to understand

534
00:24:24,837 --> 00:24:26,238
entering the Hundred-Battle Chamber

535
00:24:26,238 --> 00:24:27,518
isn't easy.

536
00:24:27,637 --> 00:24:29,558
It's much harder than you think.

537
00:24:37,837 --> 00:24:38,837
The resistance increases.

538
00:24:42,478 --> 00:24:43,758
The more Dou Qi you infuse,

539
00:24:43,758 --> 00:24:45,117
the greater the resistance.

540
00:24:45,558 --> 00:24:46,357
You must

541
00:24:46,357 --> 00:24:48,238
level up

542
00:24:48,238 --> 00:24:49,038
and even more so,

543
00:24:49,078 --> 00:24:50,798
strengthen your endurance and stamina.

544
00:24:51,558 --> 00:24:52,478
I can do it.

545
00:25:27,718 --> 00:25:29,478
You can't even open the gate.

546
00:25:29,478 --> 00:25:31,637
Do you still want to challenge
the Hundred-Battle Chamber?

547
00:25:31,958 --> 00:25:32,877
Practice

548
00:25:32,877 --> 00:25:34,357
means keeping yourself grounded.

549
00:25:34,917 --> 00:25:36,718
Only by leveling up yourself

550
00:25:36,718 --> 00:25:38,677
can you enter
the Hundred-Battle Chamber.

551
00:25:39,357 --> 00:25:41,157
Once you enter the chamber,

552
00:25:41,157 --> 00:25:42,518
you'll have a chance
to join the Xinhuo Palace.

553
00:25:49,998 --> 00:25:51,278
Xueying, don't be discouraged.

554
00:25:51,758 --> 00:25:53,318
We'll find another way.

555
00:25:59,437 --> 00:26:00,518
Ms. Tanshi,

556
00:26:00,958 --> 00:26:01,798
I will

557
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:03,478
take Borong home.

558
00:26:04,038 --> 00:26:05,437
And after he's laid to rest,

559
00:26:06,798 --> 00:26:07,758
I'll come back.

560
00:26:11,318 --> 00:26:12,318
Don't be sad.

561
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,437
We won't let Si Borong

562
00:26:14,437 --> 00:26:15,558
die in vain.

563
00:26:16,718 --> 00:26:18,677
We'll definitely make
the Demon Clan pay.

564
00:26:21,694 --> 00:26:23,365
(Changfeng Academy)

565
00:26:32,478 --> 00:26:33,478
(Si Borong's death)

566
00:26:33,518 --> 00:26:34,917
(has been a big blow to him.)

567
00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:36,958
(It feels like he's a different person.)

568
00:27:04,038 --> 00:27:05,238
What are you laughing at?

569
00:27:06,117 --> 00:27:07,718
I'm laughing at your misery.

570
00:27:09,958 --> 00:27:10,798
It makes you so happy

571
00:27:10,798 --> 00:27:12,117
to see me pathetic?

572
00:27:12,357 --> 00:27:13,958
You just look

573
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:15,478
like a total mess

574
00:27:15,478 --> 00:27:16,357
like me,

575
00:27:16,357 --> 00:27:16,917
so when you see

576
00:27:16,958 --> 00:27:17,958
me in this state,

577
00:27:17,958 --> 00:27:19,998
you feel particularly happy?

578
00:27:20,117 --> 00:27:22,238
Even if I look non-human,

579
00:27:23,917 --> 00:27:25,357
I'm still different from you.

580
00:27:25,718 --> 00:27:26,917
How are we different?

581
00:27:27,397 --> 00:27:29,038
I'm just physically weak,

582
00:27:30,758 --> 00:27:31,958
but your heart

583
00:27:32,877 --> 00:27:34,117
has been corrupted.

584
00:27:36,478 --> 00:27:37,718
Now for me, to kill you

585
00:27:37,718 --> 00:27:39,278
is as simple

586
00:27:39,278 --> 00:27:40,478
as crushing an ant.

587
00:27:40,798 --> 00:27:41,798
You still don't know

588
00:27:41,837 --> 00:27:43,437
the secret of the Ancient Bloodline.

589
00:27:44,478 --> 00:27:46,157
Are you willing to kill me?

590
00:27:51,437 --> 00:27:52,437
Why do you

591
00:27:52,518 --> 00:27:54,718
prefer to see me hurt, humiliated,

592
00:27:54,718 --> 00:27:55,597
but refuse to tell me

593
00:27:55,597 --> 00:27:57,318
the secret of the Ancient Bloodline?

594
00:27:57,437 --> 00:27:58,718
It's been ten years.

595
00:27:58,837 --> 00:27:59,958
If you had given me

596
00:27:59,998 --> 00:28:02,238
even a tiny hint earlier,

597
00:28:02,558 --> 00:28:03,318
I wouldn't have ended up

598
00:28:03,397 --> 00:28:05,197
in this situation today.

599
00:28:06,157 --> 00:28:07,038
Moyang Chen,

600
00:28:08,837 --> 00:28:10,078
are you deceiving me

601
00:28:11,397 --> 00:28:13,397
or deceiving yourself?

602
00:28:14,197 --> 00:28:16,478
You've practiced demonic techniques
for more than ten years.

603
00:28:17,437 --> 00:28:18,917
You only care about cultivation

604
00:28:19,437 --> 00:28:21,318
but have no sense of right and wrong.

605
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,437
You don't know what to do

606
00:28:23,437 --> 00:28:24,758
and what not to do.

607
00:28:25,357 --> 00:28:26,558
What's the point

608
00:28:26,558 --> 00:28:27,677
of reaching the ultimate level?

609
00:28:28,078 --> 00:28:29,637
You don't even deserve
to be called a cultivator.

610
00:28:30,038 --> 00:28:31,478
Master He should have killed

611
00:28:31,478 --> 00:28:32,597
a traitor like you long ago.

612
00:28:40,157 --> 00:28:41,117
Second Priest.

613
00:28:42,038 --> 00:28:43,157
Moyang Chen,

614
00:28:43,437 --> 00:28:44,998
you've got some nerve.

615
00:28:45,597 --> 00:28:47,637
High Priest asked you
to keep an eye on Moyang Yu,

616
00:28:48,238 --> 00:28:49,837
but you want her life.

617
00:28:50,357 --> 00:28:50,998
Are you

618
00:28:50,998 --> 00:28:52,958
tired of living?

619
00:28:54,357 --> 00:28:55,677
Second Priest, calm your anger.

620
00:28:56,278 --> 00:28:57,117
My sister

621
00:28:57,357 --> 00:28:58,558
baited me.

622
00:28:58,837 --> 00:28:59,718
I was just

623
00:28:59,798 --> 00:29:01,558
giving her a small punishment.

624
00:29:01,558 --> 00:29:03,397
There's one thing
you need to keep in mind.

625
00:29:04,197 --> 00:29:05,917
She's not just your sister now

626
00:29:06,437 --> 00:29:07,478
but also an important pawn

627
00:29:07,478 --> 00:29:08,758
for our clan.

628
00:29:09,357 --> 00:29:10,318
If you continue to act

629
00:29:10,318 --> 00:29:11,998
without weighing the consequences,

630
00:29:12,518 --> 00:29:13,278
you can forget

631
00:29:13,798 --> 00:29:15,837
about obtaining more technique books.

632
00:29:18,958 --> 00:29:19,958
Understood.

633
00:29:31,437 --> 00:29:32,637
There's another matter.

634
00:29:33,197 --> 00:29:34,637
I want you to set off immediately

635
00:29:34,798 --> 00:29:35,798
to Nanqin.

636
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:37,877
I'll arrange for someone
to meet you there.

637
00:29:38,397 --> 00:29:39,637
I want you to lead a team

638
00:29:39,837 --> 00:29:40,998
to attack the Demon Well.

639
00:29:41,357 --> 00:29:42,637
Now, the entire Dragon Mountain Empire

640
00:29:42,637 --> 00:29:43,718
is after me.

641
00:29:43,958 --> 00:29:44,718
If they see me

642
00:29:44,718 --> 00:29:46,078
leading demons

643
00:29:46,078 --> 00:29:47,518
to attack the Demon Well,

644
00:29:47,958 --> 00:29:50,197
they'll tear me to pieces.

645
00:29:50,518 --> 00:29:51,197
Moreover,

646
00:29:51,278 --> 00:29:53,238
the Demon Well is heavily guarded.

647
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:53,998
If I go

648
00:29:53,998 --> 00:29:55,278
to attack it now,

649
00:29:56,357 --> 00:29:58,117
it would be no different
than courting death.

650
00:29:58,238 --> 00:29:59,157
Second Priest,

651
00:29:59,357 --> 00:30:01,197
isn't that basically
asking me to be killed?

652
00:30:01,318 --> 00:30:02,397
What?

653
00:30:03,597 --> 00:30:05,038
You want to defy orders?

654
00:30:05,718 --> 00:30:06,238
I...

655
00:30:06,437 --> 00:30:06,958
I...

656
00:30:07,157 --> 00:30:08,478
I just wanted to say,

657
00:30:08,917 --> 00:30:10,078
with my current cultivation level,

658
00:30:10,078 --> 00:30:12,197
there's no chance of winning
if I attack the Demon Well.

659
00:30:12,718 --> 00:30:13,238
Then

660
00:30:13,357 --> 00:30:14,478
not only would I risk my life,

661
00:30:14,677 --> 00:30:16,397
but I'd also mess up your plan.

662
00:30:17,558 --> 00:30:18,558
I don't want you

663
00:30:18,558 --> 00:30:20,238
to actually attack the Demon Well.

664
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:22,197
I want you to confuse them

665
00:30:22,397 --> 00:30:23,597
while we execute our plan elsewhere.

666
00:30:23,718 --> 00:30:25,078
The longer you can
misdirect them, the better.

667
00:30:25,518 --> 00:30:26,437
This way,

668
00:30:26,877 --> 00:30:28,357
our plan

669
00:30:28,637 --> 00:30:29,917
can proceed more smoothly.

670
00:30:30,958 --> 00:30:32,117
When the time comes,

671
00:30:32,238 --> 00:30:33,397
find a way to escape

672
00:30:33,397 --> 00:30:34,197
on your own.

673
00:30:37,157 --> 00:30:37,998
Yes.

674
00:30:39,437 --> 00:30:40,798
(What are they planning?)

675
00:30:41,157 --> 00:30:42,397
(Behind feigning an attack
on the Demon Well,)

676
00:30:42,597 --> 00:30:43,958
(what's their real plan?)

677
00:30:44,357 --> 00:30:46,197
(The Elders
will definitely fall for it.)

678
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:47,478
(I need to find a way)

679
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:49,117
(to let them know it.)

680
00:30:56,397 --> 00:30:57,718
Come with me.

681
00:31:07,888 --> 00:31:11,317
(Si Mansion)

682
00:31:27,278 --> 00:31:27,998
What?

683
00:31:28,718 --> 00:31:30,238
What happened to him?

684
00:31:33,597 --> 00:31:34,318
The Demon Clan

685
00:31:34,877 --> 00:31:36,238
captured Changfeng's disciples

686
00:31:36,518 --> 00:31:38,157
and turned them
into Black Armored Warriors.

687
00:31:39,478 --> 00:31:40,518
And Borong was one

688
00:31:41,998 --> 00:31:43,157
of their unfortunate victims.

689
00:31:44,078 --> 00:31:44,877
"Unfortunate"?

690
00:31:45,357 --> 00:31:46,238
He died,

691
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:47,597
but you're trying to downplay

692
00:31:47,597 --> 00:31:49,157
his death as merely "unfortunate"?

693
00:31:49,998 --> 00:31:51,998
He was your cousin.

694
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:53,877
After Borong was captured,

695
00:31:54,718 --> 00:31:55,998
I'd been searching for him.

696
00:31:56,877 --> 00:31:57,677
Unfortunately,

697
00:31:58,758 --> 00:31:59,917
I was still too late.

698
00:32:00,357 --> 00:32:02,157
Where were you when he was in trouble?

699
00:32:02,478 --> 00:32:03,278
Why weren't you

700
00:32:03,278 --> 00:32:04,677
with him?

701
00:32:06,637 --> 00:32:08,238
Before you went to Changfeng Academy,

702
00:32:08,238 --> 00:32:09,637
I told you

703
00:32:09,877 --> 00:32:11,197
to look out for each other

704
00:32:11,197 --> 00:32:12,677
when you're away from home.

705
00:32:13,038 --> 00:32:15,078
Is this the result of your care?

706
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:19,958
When Borong went missing,

707
00:32:20,238 --> 00:32:22,078
you didn't search for him right away,

708
00:32:22,397 --> 00:32:24,357
nor did you inform me.

709
00:32:25,157 --> 00:32:26,157
After I left,

710
00:32:26,238 --> 00:32:27,798
did you even

711
00:32:27,798 --> 00:32:29,758
try to find him?

712
00:32:31,718 --> 00:32:32,758
Get out!

713
00:32:34,718 --> 00:32:35,798
Get out!

714
00:33:05,837 --> 00:33:06,437
(No, that's not right.)

715
00:33:06,917 --> 00:33:08,117
(Focus your Dou Qi
on your energy center.)

716
00:33:09,637 --> 00:33:10,478
Hold it.

717
00:33:12,518 --> 00:33:13,478
Still not right.

718
00:33:14,157 --> 00:33:15,718
Condense your Dou Qi into a ball.

719
00:33:15,798 --> 00:33:16,758
Use the force

720
00:33:16,758 --> 00:33:17,877
and control it freely.

721
00:33:27,157 --> 00:33:27,798
Aunt,

722
00:33:28,038 --> 00:33:29,558
when are we going to eat?

723
00:33:29,558 --> 00:33:30,718
I'm starving.

724
00:33:30,798 --> 00:33:31,798
You want to eat?

725
00:33:31,877 --> 00:33:32,837
Did you learn it?

726
00:33:32,837 --> 00:33:34,437
Yes, I did.

727
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,917
But I'm just too hungry.

728
00:33:35,917 --> 00:33:36,998
I haven't eaten all day.

729
00:33:37,038 --> 00:33:38,397
If you give me a roasted chicken

730
00:33:38,397 --> 00:33:39,518
and let me have a full meal,

731
00:33:39,637 --> 00:33:40,998
I'll definitely perform it perfectly

732
00:33:40,998 --> 00:33:42,157
and make you satisfied.

733
00:33:43,637 --> 00:33:45,038
Alright, it's noon.

734
00:33:45,238 --> 00:33:46,677
Let's eat first.

735
00:33:47,197 --> 00:33:48,238
Thank you, Aunt.

736
00:33:50,518 --> 00:33:51,318
Keep practicing.

737
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:04,718
Aunt...

738
00:34:11,918 --> 00:34:13,237
Since childhood,

739
00:34:14,918 --> 00:34:16,838
you'd always favored Borong.

740
00:34:19,078 --> 00:34:21,117
No matter if he did well or not,

741
00:34:22,317 --> 00:34:23,358
you always

742
00:34:23,358 --> 00:34:24,878
encouraged and praised him.

743
00:34:27,117 --> 00:34:29,078
But no matter how hard I try

744
00:34:29,677 --> 00:34:30,717
or how serious I am,

745
00:34:32,918 --> 00:34:34,918
all I get is a cold response.

746
00:34:36,677 --> 00:34:38,677
I'm of a side branch of the Si Family,

747
00:34:40,918 --> 00:34:41,757
so

748
00:34:44,237 --> 00:34:45,237
everyone

749
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,597
has to look down on me?

750
00:34:54,398 --> 00:34:55,197
Never mind.

751
00:34:57,998 --> 00:34:59,717
I may be just unlucky.

752
00:35:02,958 --> 00:35:05,157
I'll be stronger and stronger.

753
00:35:17,398 --> 00:35:18,157
Take care.

754
00:35:19,078 --> 00:35:20,358
Would you like a drink, sir?

755
00:35:20,358 --> 00:35:21,157
Please come in.

756
00:35:23,358 --> 00:35:23,797
Here.

757
00:35:25,317 --> 00:35:26,078
Sir,

758
00:35:26,237 --> 00:35:27,358
what would you like to drink?

759
00:35:29,637 --> 00:35:30,677
Two jars of Forget-Worries.

760
00:35:30,998 --> 00:35:31,958
Alright.

761
00:35:32,358 --> 00:35:34,317
Two pots of Forget-Worries.

762
00:35:37,797 --> 00:35:39,237
Here's the wine.

763
00:35:41,757 --> 00:35:42,838
Here you go, sir.

764
00:35:46,677 --> 00:35:47,757
Enjoy, sir.

765
00:36:00,478 --> 00:36:02,317
Situ Hong,

766
00:36:03,757 --> 00:36:04,958
in your life,

767
00:36:05,998 --> 00:36:07,237
the saddest thing

768
00:36:08,597 --> 00:36:09,958
is that you are

769
00:36:10,438 --> 00:36:11,637
from the Si Family.

770
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:16,478
No,

771
00:36:17,038 --> 00:36:18,757
strictly speaking,

772
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:23,078
whether it's in your aunt's eyes

773
00:36:23,117 --> 00:36:24,317
or in the eyes

774
00:36:24,317 --> 00:36:26,438
of the clan elders,

775
00:36:26,838 --> 00:36:28,078
only Si Borong

776
00:36:29,998 --> 00:36:31,838
is the pride of the Si Family.

777
00:36:33,197 --> 00:36:34,078
And you

778
00:36:36,117 --> 00:36:37,237
are just a dog

779
00:36:37,237 --> 00:36:38,958
to them.

780
00:36:43,023 --> 00:36:49,197
(Si Mansion)

781
00:36:49,197 --> 00:36:49,958
Your Lordship,

782
00:36:50,078 --> 00:36:51,597
you drank so much.

783
00:36:51,597 --> 00:36:52,878
You're drunk.

784
00:36:54,558 --> 00:36:55,197
You're drunk.

785
00:36:55,197 --> 00:36:56,117
Your Lordship.

786
00:36:56,838 --> 00:36:57,637
Stand here.

787
00:36:58,518 --> 00:36:59,677
Where's Borong?

788
00:37:01,438 --> 00:37:02,597
Si Borong.

789
00:37:02,597 --> 00:37:03,117
Well...

790
00:37:04,237 --> 00:37:05,197
Borong.

791
00:37:07,277 --> 00:37:08,918
Where did that brat go?

792
00:37:08,918 --> 00:37:09,637
Stop.

793
00:37:16,518 --> 00:37:17,518
Aunt,

794
00:37:17,677 --> 00:37:19,677
why aren't you asleep so late?

795
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:20,197
You...

796
00:37:20,197 --> 00:37:21,637
Look at you, reeking of alcohol.

797
00:37:21,637 --> 00:37:22,918
You know what you look like?

798
00:37:23,597 --> 00:37:24,797
Just drinking a little.

799
00:37:25,518 --> 00:37:26,518
It's no big deal.

800
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,757
Your cousin just died,

801
00:37:28,757 --> 00:37:30,558
and you still have the mood
to go out and have fun.

802
00:37:30,757 --> 00:37:32,478
You're simply heartless.

803
00:37:32,478 --> 00:37:34,677
Yes, I am heartless.

804
00:37:34,878 --> 00:37:35,998
I'm having fun.

805
00:37:37,717 --> 00:37:39,677
I'm having fun for you, Aunt.

806
00:37:39,958 --> 00:37:40,998
For me?

807
00:37:41,277 --> 00:37:44,078
You like Chi Qiubai, don't you?

808
00:37:44,518 --> 00:37:45,197
But he already

809
00:37:45,197 --> 00:37:46,518
has Master Xiaoxi by his side.

810
00:37:46,518 --> 00:37:48,078
You have no chance.

811
00:37:48,277 --> 00:37:50,157
Now that Master Xiaoxi is dead,

812
00:37:50,558 --> 00:37:51,998
you have another chance.

813
00:37:52,277 --> 00:37:53,757
You can boldly

814
00:37:54,197 --> 00:37:55,918
express your love.

815
00:37:56,358 --> 00:37:57,117
Shut up.

816
00:37:57,478 --> 00:37:59,398
Where did you hear such filthy words?

817
00:37:59,438 --> 00:38:00,478
If you spout nonsense again,

818
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,677
I'll tear your mouth apart.

819
00:38:01,677 --> 00:38:03,838
Yes, it's all filthy words.

820
00:38:04,197 --> 00:38:05,637
Do you know what my schoolmates

821
00:38:05,637 --> 00:38:07,878
at Changfeng Academy say about me?

822
00:38:08,277 --> 00:38:09,317
They say

823
00:38:10,277 --> 00:38:11,478
my aunt

824
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:13,597
and our dean

825
00:38:13,998 --> 00:38:16,398
often research spells day and night

826
00:38:17,078 --> 00:38:18,197
in their room.

827
00:38:18,757 --> 00:38:19,677
They say

828
00:38:19,677 --> 00:38:21,078
our family's Vanishing Technique

829
00:38:22,277 --> 00:38:24,558
and his Space Split Spear Technique

830
00:38:24,558 --> 00:38:26,637
share similarities

831
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:28,478
in essence.

832
00:38:28,478 --> 00:38:28,958
You...

833
00:38:29,237 --> 00:38:30,157
Aunt.

834
00:38:33,038 --> 00:38:34,358
You ungrateful man,

835
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:36,117
talking nonsense.

836
00:38:36,478 --> 00:38:37,558
Hit me.

837
00:38:37,918 --> 00:38:39,438
Kill me.

838
00:38:39,677 --> 00:38:40,717
Anyway, I can't be

839
00:38:40,717 --> 00:38:42,438
the top student at Changfeng Academy.

840
00:38:42,558 --> 00:38:43,358
I didn't fulfill

841
00:38:43,358 --> 00:38:44,757
your expectations.

842
00:38:44,757 --> 00:38:46,757
I can't beat Dongbo Xueying either.

843
00:38:46,757 --> 00:38:47,558
If I had known you were

844
00:38:47,558 --> 00:38:48,717
such a waste,

845
00:38:48,878 --> 00:38:49,478
back then,

846
00:38:49,478 --> 00:38:50,478
I shouldn't have let you

847
00:38:50,478 --> 00:38:51,558
join our family

848
00:38:51,637 --> 00:38:53,757
and put so much effort into you.

849
00:38:53,757 --> 00:38:55,117
I am a waste.

850
00:38:57,237 --> 00:38:59,797
You finally said what was on your mind.

851
00:39:00,078 --> 00:39:01,757
Putting effort into me?

852
00:39:02,237 --> 00:39:03,677
No matter

853
00:39:04,358 --> 00:39:06,438
how well I did,

854
00:39:08,317 --> 00:39:10,277
you never praised me.

855
00:39:11,317 --> 00:39:12,518
I am a waste.

856
00:39:12,958 --> 00:39:14,918
You disappointed me so much.

857
00:39:30,587 --> 00:39:34,392
(Si Borong's Tomb)

858
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:38,878
Borong.

859
00:39:56,478 --> 00:39:58,197
Why don't you go over there?

860
00:39:59,117 --> 00:40:00,117
Moyang Chen!

861
00:40:05,717 --> 00:40:06,597
Moyang Chen,

862
00:40:07,518 --> 00:40:08,558
you collude with the Demon Clan.

863
00:40:08,558 --> 00:40:09,918
How dare you show up!

864
00:40:10,237 --> 00:40:11,637
Maybe we can work together.

865
00:40:11,637 --> 00:40:12,998
I won't

866
00:40:13,478 --> 00:40:14,838
work with a traitor like you.

867
00:40:15,157 --> 00:40:16,597
Don't pretend to be so righteous.

868
00:40:17,117 --> 00:40:18,838
Cui Yong's and Si Borong's deaths.

869
00:40:18,838 --> 00:40:19,958
Did you forget them?

870
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:22,797
Weren't they killed by you?

871
00:40:28,558 --> 00:40:29,838
You have no evidence.

872
00:40:29,878 --> 00:40:31,197
Don't slander me.

873
00:40:31,317 --> 00:40:32,677
On the day of the Transcendent Battle,

874
00:40:32,918 --> 00:40:34,597
the demons saw it.

875
00:40:34,998 --> 00:40:36,717
Do you want me
to call them over as witnesses?

876
00:40:43,317 --> 00:40:44,998
What do you want?

877
00:40:47,237 --> 00:40:48,958
I want you to help me.

878
00:40:49,117 --> 00:40:50,358
I want the manual

879
00:40:50,358 --> 00:40:52,398
of the Vanishing Technique.

880
00:40:52,558 --> 00:40:54,197
The Vanishing Technique

881
00:40:54,197 --> 00:40:55,358
is my family's top-secret technique.

882
00:40:55,717 --> 00:40:56,637
You?

883
00:40:57,438 --> 00:40:58,317
You want to learn it?

884
00:40:58,317 --> 00:40:59,677
I can exchange another technique

885
00:40:59,677 --> 00:41:00,637
for it.

886
00:41:01,398 --> 00:41:02,358
No way.

887
00:41:02,797 --> 00:41:03,717
It's a technique

888
00:41:03,717 --> 00:41:05,157
that can increase your strength

889
00:41:05,157 --> 00:41:07,197
tenfold in a short time.

890
00:41:09,438 --> 00:41:11,078
How can there be such a technique?

891
00:41:11,317 --> 00:41:12,518
You'll know

892
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:13,717
if you give it a try.

893
00:41:15,038 --> 00:41:16,197
Don't worry.

894
00:41:16,358 --> 00:41:17,478
Take your time to consider.

895
00:41:17,878 --> 00:41:19,358
I'll come back to you in a few days.

896
00:41:20,197 --> 00:41:21,797
Seize the opportunity

897
00:41:23,078 --> 00:41:24,157
unless

898
00:41:24,797 --> 00:41:26,958
you want to be a loser forever.
