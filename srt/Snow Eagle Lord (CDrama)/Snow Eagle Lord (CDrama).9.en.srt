21
00:01:46,458 --> 00:01:47,618
In a short period of time,

22
00:01:47,618 --> 00:01:50,017
it's nearly impossible

23
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:51,258
to get so many source stones again.

24
00:01:51,417 --> 00:01:53,017
What do you think, High Priest,

25
00:01:53,137 --> 00:01:54,618
we should do then?

26
00:01:54,738 --> 00:01:56,338
There is a way,

27
00:01:56,417 --> 00:01:59,058
but it's somewhat risky.

28
00:01:59,137 --> 00:02:00,738
High Priest, please speak your mind.

29
00:02:10,097 --> 00:02:11,777
Fog City.

30
00:02:13,298 --> 00:02:13,977
Are you suggesting

31
00:02:13,977 --> 00:02:15,697
we directly rob
a Transcendent organization?

32
00:02:16,138 --> 00:02:17,377
What?

33
00:02:17,618 --> 00:02:18,858
Are you scared?

34
00:02:19,657 --> 00:02:20,618
Scared of what?

35
00:02:20,977 --> 00:02:22,657
I'm just worried
we don't have enough manpower.

36
00:02:22,937 --> 00:02:23,977
Otherwise,

37
00:02:24,058 --> 00:02:25,657
with our power,

38
00:02:25,657 --> 00:02:26,777
we would definitely crush

39
00:02:26,777 --> 00:02:27,537
mortals like the Xia Clan.

40
00:02:28,657 --> 00:02:29,537
Those Transcendent organizations

41
00:02:29,537 --> 00:02:31,178
are not invulnerable.

42
00:02:31,497 --> 00:02:32,578
It's time for

43
00:02:32,578 --> 00:02:34,298
the spies in their organizations

44
00:02:34,298 --> 00:02:36,217
to act now.

45
00:02:36,697 --> 00:02:38,097
You're right, High Priest.

46
00:02:38,418 --> 00:02:40,217
We all serve the Demon God,

47
00:02:40,497 --> 00:02:41,657
even if it costs us our lives.

48
00:02:41,657 --> 00:02:43,058
Based on the intelligence
we've received,

49
00:02:43,058 --> 00:02:44,138
follow my command.

50
00:02:44,138 --> 00:02:45,777
This is our last chance.

51
00:02:45,777 --> 00:02:47,618
We must not fail again.

52
00:02:47,697 --> 00:02:48,458
Yes.

53
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:51,178
(Dongbo Xueying)

54
00:02:51,178 --> 00:02:52,618
(has ruined our plans several times.)

55
00:02:52,738 --> 00:02:53,937
(This time,)

56
00:02:54,018 --> 00:02:55,418
(I will personally tear him)

57
00:02:55,418 --> 00:02:56,657
(to pieces.)

58
00:02:56,817 --> 00:02:58,298
This one must go in.

59
00:03:02,578 --> 00:03:03,937
Xueying.

60
00:03:04,018 --> 00:03:04,937
Youyue.

61
00:03:06,257 --> 00:03:07,298
Youyue,

62
00:03:07,377 --> 00:03:09,257
are you here to see Xueying?

63
00:03:11,338 --> 00:03:12,298
What are you carrying?

64
00:03:12,298 --> 00:03:12,738
It smells so good.

65
00:03:12,738 --> 00:03:13,777
Let me hold it for you.

66
00:03:13,777 --> 00:03:14,458
No, thanks.

67
00:03:15,977 --> 00:03:17,058
Xueying,

68
00:03:17,697 --> 00:03:18,977
do you feel better?

69
00:03:19,018 --> 00:03:20,458
Does your wound still hurt?

70
00:03:21,178 --> 00:03:22,217
I'm already fine.

71
00:03:26,298 --> 00:03:27,458
What is this?

72
00:03:27,537 --> 00:03:29,217
This is Lingcao herb soup

73
00:03:29,217 --> 00:03:30,458
I made for Xueying.

74
00:03:30,738 --> 00:03:32,377
It can help gather energy
and focus the mind.

75
00:03:32,738 --> 00:03:35,018
Look how much she cares for you.

76
00:03:35,018 --> 00:03:35,898
Is this delicious food

77
00:03:35,898 --> 00:03:36,697
specially made for us

78
00:03:36,738 --> 00:03:38,058
to recover?

79
00:03:39,338 --> 00:03:40,497
Xueying,

80
00:03:40,497 --> 00:03:42,257
it's very beneficial
for your body's recovery.

81
00:03:42,977 --> 00:03:44,178
Youyue, I...

82
00:03:44,418 --> 00:03:44,898
Oh, right.

83
00:03:45,018 --> 00:03:46,217
You just finished practicing,

84
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:47,217
so you shouldn't have nourishment now.

85
00:03:47,338 --> 00:03:49,058
You might eat it later.

86
00:03:54,738 --> 00:03:55,977
This soup is very helpful

87
00:03:55,977 --> 00:03:56,657
for the body's recovery.

88
00:03:56,657 --> 00:03:57,377
Make sure

89
00:03:57,377 --> 00:03:58,458
Xueying finishes it.

90
00:03:58,458 --> 00:04:01,257
Do I get a share too?

91
00:04:01,257 --> 00:04:02,657
You can help him

92
00:04:02,657 --> 00:04:03,537
with the rest.

93
00:04:05,377 --> 00:04:07,418
Youyue, you're so kind.

94
00:04:07,497 --> 00:04:08,977
You're so beautiful,

95
00:04:08,977 --> 00:04:10,217
and the soup you make is so delicious.

96
00:04:10,217 --> 00:04:11,097
Whoever marries a girl

97
00:04:11,097 --> 00:04:11,937
like you

98
00:04:11,937 --> 00:04:13,377
will definitely live a happy life.

99
00:04:14,858 --> 00:04:16,178
I'm leaving.

100
00:04:16,618 --> 00:04:17,817
Remember

101
00:04:17,817 --> 00:04:19,137
to finish this soup, alright?

102
00:04:27,098 --> 00:04:28,017
Xueying,

103
00:04:28,937 --> 00:04:30,058
I don't know

104
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:31,457
whether this soup

105
00:04:31,457 --> 00:04:32,298
is good for the body or not,

106
00:04:32,298 --> 00:04:34,218
but I'm really hungry now.

107
00:04:34,697 --> 00:04:36,137
There's Deerhorn Glue in it,

108
00:04:36,137 --> 00:04:37,017
and I can't eat it.

109
00:04:37,257 --> 00:04:38,257
Deerhorn Glue?

110
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:39,778
Are you sure?

111
00:04:40,337 --> 00:04:41,697
I accidentally ate some as a child,

112
00:04:41,697 --> 00:04:42,577
and it nearly caused a problem.

113
00:04:42,778 --> 00:04:44,017
So I can tell by the smell.

114
00:04:44,577 --> 00:04:45,937
If you're not going to eat it,

115
00:04:45,937 --> 00:04:47,618
I'll have it all for you.

116
00:05:00,738 --> 00:05:01,618
Xueying,

117
00:05:01,897 --> 00:05:03,337
this soup tastes really good.

118
00:05:03,457 --> 00:05:04,697
Are you sure you don't want any?

119
00:05:09,457 --> 00:05:10,778
It's you who treat me well,

120
00:05:10,937 --> 00:05:12,377
not like those young aristocrats

121
00:05:12,377 --> 00:05:13,418
who always look down upon me.

122
00:05:13,418 --> 00:05:14,418
I really don't understand.

123
00:05:14,418 --> 00:05:15,218
Why do they have to

124
00:05:15,218 --> 00:05:15,897
divide people

125
00:05:15,897 --> 00:05:17,298
into classes?

126
00:05:17,298 --> 00:05:19,058
Always trying to curry favor
with those from the upper classes

127
00:05:19,058 --> 00:05:20,418
or with influence.

128
00:05:21,538 --> 00:05:23,137
Don't care too much
about what others think.

129
00:05:24,137 --> 00:05:24,697
Right.

130
00:05:24,817 --> 00:05:25,577
Anyway, in the future,

131
00:05:25,577 --> 00:05:26,618
I'll just focus on practicing.

132
00:05:26,618 --> 00:05:28,178
We'll be the happiest commoners

133
00:05:28,178 --> 00:05:29,618
at Changfeng Academy.

134
00:05:29,697 --> 00:05:30,618
Of course.

135
00:05:31,817 --> 00:05:32,778
Don't forget about me even when you have

136
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:33,978
your own family in the future.

137
00:05:36,618 --> 00:05:38,058
Xueying, are you there?

138
00:05:42,178 --> 00:05:42,858
I'm here.

139
00:05:44,497 --> 00:05:46,457
I made you medicine
with herbs from the pharmacy.

140
00:05:46,457 --> 00:05:47,658
That's a prescription
told by the Faction Leader

141
00:05:47,658 --> 00:05:49,017
of the Water Daoist Temple.

142
00:05:49,497 --> 00:05:50,377
It may help you

143
00:05:50,377 --> 00:05:51,538
recover.

144
00:05:52,377 --> 00:05:53,738
Thank you for your care.

145
00:05:55,978 --> 00:05:57,697
Xueying, you're really popular.

146
00:05:57,858 --> 00:05:58,618
Just now, Youyue

147
00:05:58,618 --> 00:06:00,058
brought over some Lingcao herb soup,

148
00:06:00,058 --> 00:06:01,738
and now Jingqiu brought you
the medicine she made.

149
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:02,298
In a while, I'll give you

150
00:06:02,298 --> 00:06:03,418
a massage.

151
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:06,658
Since you already had the soup,

152
00:06:06,817 --> 00:06:08,098
this medicine is of no use to you now.

153
00:06:08,658 --> 00:06:09,937
No, no.

154
00:06:09,937 --> 00:06:11,137
Taking too much medicine

155
00:06:11,137 --> 00:06:12,058
is not good.

156
00:06:12,058 --> 00:06:13,298
I didn't have the soup.

157
00:06:13,298 --> 00:06:14,178
Puyang Bo did.

158
00:06:14,257 --> 00:06:15,337
I'll only take your medicine.

159
00:06:16,538 --> 00:06:17,298
Right.

160
00:06:17,298 --> 00:06:18,738
I ate all the soup just now.

161
00:06:18,738 --> 00:06:19,738
There was Deerhorn Glue in it,

162
00:06:19,738 --> 00:06:20,457
so he couldn't eat it.

163
00:06:20,858 --> 00:06:21,858
But, Jingqiu,

164
00:06:21,858 --> 00:06:22,738
please don't tell Youyue

165
00:06:22,738 --> 00:06:23,738
I ate all the soup,

166
00:06:23,738 --> 00:06:25,218
or else she'll definitely be mad at me.

167
00:06:26,017 --> 00:06:27,298
Come in and sit down.

168
00:06:33,697 --> 00:06:34,418
Xueying,

169
00:06:34,418 --> 00:06:35,738
this soup smells good too.

170
00:06:35,738 --> 00:06:37,017
Ask Jingqiu

171
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:38,218
if there's anything you can't drink

172
00:06:38,218 --> 00:06:39,218
in it.

173
00:06:39,218 --> 00:06:40,218
Maybe I can...

174
00:06:42,017 --> 00:06:42,897
No matter what's in it,

175
00:06:42,897 --> 00:06:43,778
I'll eat it.

176
00:06:49,858 --> 00:06:50,897
It's so delicious.

177
00:07:08,618 --> 00:07:10,897
How could the branch
of the Demon God Association

178
00:07:11,017 --> 00:07:12,457
in Lu's Fort hide for so long?

179
00:07:13,098 --> 00:07:14,658
It's shocking
how much our internal affairs

180
00:07:14,658 --> 00:07:16,178
have been infiltrated by them.

181
00:07:17,178 --> 00:07:18,218
At least Qiubai,

182
00:07:18,218 --> 00:07:19,377
together with the academy disciples,

183
00:07:19,377 --> 00:07:20,978
destroyed one of their branches.

184
00:07:21,058 --> 00:07:23,178
Their losses must be significant,

185
00:07:23,337 --> 00:07:24,778
serving as a lesson for them.

186
00:07:24,778 --> 00:07:26,017
I'm worried

187
00:07:26,418 --> 00:07:28,377
that this will provoke them even more.

188
00:07:28,497 --> 00:07:30,337
Lu's Fort was destroyed,

189
00:07:30,377 --> 00:07:31,418
but the demons

190
00:07:31,538 --> 00:07:33,418
disappeared without a trace again.

191
00:07:33,577 --> 00:07:34,337
Who knows

192
00:07:34,337 --> 00:07:35,577
what they will do next?

193
00:07:35,658 --> 00:07:37,937
Lu's Fort had a large number
of source stones stored.

194
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:39,218
I guess

195
00:07:39,457 --> 00:07:41,257
they are in great need of source stones.

196
00:07:42,858 --> 00:07:44,098
Knowing escape was impossible,

197
00:07:44,257 --> 00:07:46,697
the demon destroyed the entire fort.

198
00:07:46,937 --> 00:07:48,377
What a madman.

199
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:49,817
They will definitely

200
00:07:50,017 --> 00:07:50,978
have their next move

201
00:07:50,978 --> 00:07:52,098
after this one.

202
00:07:52,137 --> 00:07:53,538
As Qiubai said,

203
00:07:53,658 --> 00:07:55,778
the source stones circulating
in the market

204
00:07:55,778 --> 00:07:56,858
are far less than the number stored

205
00:07:56,858 --> 00:07:57,817
in Lu's Fort.

206
00:07:57,858 --> 00:08:00,298
The Demon Clan is always vicious.

207
00:08:01,298 --> 00:08:02,418
To be prepared,

208
00:08:02,418 --> 00:08:04,497
each sect needs to store

209
00:08:04,577 --> 00:08:05,738
more source stones.

210
00:08:29,778 --> 00:08:30,658
You're here.

211
00:08:31,137 --> 00:08:32,378
I've sewn your clothes,

212
00:08:32,378 --> 00:08:33,538
so I brought them over.

213
00:08:44,817 --> 00:08:45,658
Xiaoxi,

214
00:08:46,498 --> 00:08:47,817
it's great to have you here.

215
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:50,138
It feels like home with you around.

216
00:08:53,857 --> 00:08:55,258
I'm always here.

217
00:09:02,258 --> 00:09:03,138
Xiaoxi,

218
00:09:03,538 --> 00:09:04,857
you not only need
to protect the Fog City

219
00:09:04,857 --> 00:09:05,817
and those source stones,

220
00:09:05,817 --> 00:09:07,298
but also take care of yourself.

221
00:09:08,058 --> 00:09:08,898
Don't worry.

222
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:10,617
I've already reinforced the barrier.

223
00:09:10,658 --> 00:09:11,658
No one can break it

224
00:09:11,658 --> 00:09:12,538
unless Chunyuan and I perform

225
00:09:12,538 --> 00:09:13,658
Double Fans.

226
00:09:16,298 --> 00:09:17,217
Qiubai,

227
00:09:17,617 --> 00:09:19,258
no matter what happens in the future,

228
00:09:19,538 --> 00:09:21,018
no matter what you want to do,

229
00:09:21,538 --> 00:09:22,778
the Fog City and I

230
00:09:22,857 --> 00:09:24,138
will back you up.

231
00:09:24,457 --> 00:09:25,857
As long as I'm with you,

232
00:09:26,217 --> 00:09:27,937
I'm the happiest one in the world.

233
00:09:28,217 --> 00:09:29,737
You're the closest person to me, too.

234
00:09:31,457 --> 00:09:32,577
Even if

235
00:09:33,498 --> 00:09:35,058
I'm not here in the future,

236
00:09:35,697 --> 00:09:36,737
the Fog City

237
00:09:36,857 --> 00:09:38,498
will be your strongest backing.

238
00:09:38,697 --> 00:09:40,298
What silly words.

239
00:09:40,817 --> 00:09:42,457
No matter if the Fog City exists or not,

240
00:09:43,937 --> 00:09:45,138
I only want you.

241
00:09:52,138 --> 00:09:53,258
Oh, right, Qiubai,

242
00:09:53,258 --> 00:09:55,457
don't you always use
the Hexagonal Fan as your weapon?

243
00:09:55,457 --> 00:09:56,217
Why do you suddenly start

244
00:09:56,217 --> 00:09:57,457
studying spells?

245
00:10:00,857 --> 00:10:01,737
Well.

246
00:10:02,097 --> 00:10:03,898
Can't I learn spells?

247
00:10:05,058 --> 00:10:06,898
Among the many students
of Changfeng Academy

248
00:10:07,418 --> 00:10:09,217
are not only knights but also mages.

249
00:10:09,697 --> 00:10:11,498
I just want to learn about them.

250
00:10:13,937 --> 00:10:15,178
Well, I see.

251
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:17,097
And I want

252
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:19,337
to learn more about you.

253
00:10:40,058 --> 00:10:41,018
It's so late,

254
00:10:41,217 --> 00:10:42,697
and there's still someone
practicing spear?

255
00:10:42,817 --> 00:10:43,817
The Demon Clan's actions

256
00:10:43,817 --> 00:10:45,457
have made the disciples more vigilant.

257
00:10:46,097 --> 00:10:47,898
Many of them have become more diligent,

258
00:10:47,937 --> 00:10:49,778
working hard to fight
against the Demon Clan.

259
00:10:50,498 --> 00:10:52,658
The strikes sound fast,

260
00:10:52,658 --> 00:10:53,857
powerful and smooth.

261
00:10:53,977 --> 00:10:55,378
I guess his martial arts foundation

262
00:10:55,378 --> 00:10:56,378
is very solid.

263
00:10:56,498 --> 00:10:58,097
In addition to that,

264
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:00,097
his Dou Qi is strong.

265
00:11:01,058 --> 00:11:02,178
It's quite rare.

266
00:11:02,298 --> 00:11:03,418
Let's go take a look.

267
00:11:10,857 --> 00:11:11,817
Xueying?

268
00:11:11,977 --> 00:11:12,857
Didn't you say

269
00:11:12,857 --> 00:11:13,658
he's the one with the most hope

270
00:11:13,658 --> 00:11:15,217
to become a Transcendent Knight?

271
00:11:15,857 --> 00:11:17,258
He entered the academy not long ago,

272
00:11:17,658 --> 00:11:18,418
and last time, it was he

273
00:11:18,418 --> 00:11:19,418
who reported
the Lu's Fort incident to us.

274
00:11:19,857 --> 00:11:20,817
He was fearless

275
00:11:20,817 --> 00:11:21,937
during the demon elimination.

276
00:11:22,258 --> 00:11:23,018
I wonder how well

277
00:11:23,018 --> 00:11:24,018
his injuries have healed.

278
00:11:24,258 --> 00:11:25,617
Why is he still practicing
late at night?

279
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:26,937
Well,

280
00:11:27,097 --> 00:11:28,298
he reminds me

281
00:11:28,298 --> 00:11:29,457
of how you used to be.

282
00:11:29,617 --> 00:11:30,737
Why would you say this?

283
00:11:31,498 --> 00:11:32,217
Look,

284
00:11:32,498 --> 00:11:34,258
he's wholeheartedly devoted
to practicing the spear.

285
00:11:34,378 --> 00:11:35,418
From the rhythm of his breaths

286
00:11:35,418 --> 00:11:36,737
and the way he thrusts his spear,

287
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:37,778
you can feel

288
00:11:37,977 --> 00:11:39,778
his persistence, determination,

289
00:11:39,778 --> 00:11:40,898
and natural talent.

290
00:11:41,378 --> 00:11:42,378
I have a feeling

291
00:11:42,498 --> 00:11:43,658
that given time,

292
00:11:43,658 --> 00:11:45,457
he will definitely achieve something.

293
00:12:17,658 --> 00:12:18,778
Thank you, Master

294
00:12:19,058 --> 00:12:20,058
and Ms. Xiaoxi.

295
00:12:20,658 --> 00:12:21,857
Your spear technique is good,

296
00:12:21,977 --> 00:12:23,737
but your Dou Qi is a bit unstable.

297
00:12:23,977 --> 00:12:25,178
I just cultivated Dou Qi.

298
00:12:25,178 --> 00:12:26,378
Its strength fluctuates,

299
00:12:27,058 --> 00:12:28,658
but I find it hard to control it.

300
00:12:33,577 --> 00:12:34,817
This source stone

301
00:12:34,817 --> 00:12:36,337
can help stabilize your Dou Qi

302
00:12:36,337 --> 00:12:37,217
and enhance your power.

303
00:12:37,217 --> 00:12:38,138
Give it a try.

304
00:12:40,418 --> 00:12:41,498
A source stone?

305
00:12:42,298 --> 00:12:43,817
The stone that can improve our power?

306
00:12:44,018 --> 00:12:46,258
This stone can be used three times.

307
00:12:46,258 --> 00:12:47,378
If you use it properly

308
00:12:47,378 --> 00:12:48,418
during practice,

309
00:12:48,617 --> 00:12:50,697
it can stabilize your Dou Qi.

310
00:12:51,418 --> 00:12:52,697
It's generous for her

311
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:53,817
to give you
a source stone from the Fog City.

312
00:12:53,817 --> 00:12:55,337
It shows she recognizes your talents.

313
00:12:57,058 --> 00:12:58,298
Thank you, Ms. Xiaoxi.

314
00:12:59,138 --> 00:13:00,138
But

315
00:13:00,817 --> 00:13:02,097
this thing is too valuable.

316
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:02,658
I...

317
00:13:02,658 --> 00:13:03,857
No matter how precious it is,

318
00:13:03,857 --> 00:13:04,817
it can only show its value

319
00:13:04,817 --> 00:13:06,258
through its use.

320
00:13:06,617 --> 00:13:08,617
If it can help you improve your skills

321
00:13:08,737 --> 00:13:10,018
and help our empire

322
00:13:10,018 --> 00:13:11,298
cultivate another Transcendent Knight.

323
00:13:11,538 --> 00:13:12,817
That's its value.

324
00:13:13,138 --> 00:13:13,817
Yes.

325
00:13:14,217 --> 00:13:14,857
In the future,

326
00:13:15,058 --> 00:13:16,617
I will train even harder

327
00:13:16,737 --> 00:13:17,658
and master the Dark Ice Spear Technique

328
00:13:17,817 --> 00:13:19,138
as soon as possible.

329
00:13:19,617 --> 00:13:20,737
Just now, you were repelled

330
00:13:20,737 --> 00:13:21,418
by your own Dou Qi.

331
00:13:21,418 --> 00:13:22,658
Although it didn't hurt you,

332
00:13:22,737 --> 00:13:23,937
it shows

333
00:13:23,937 --> 00:13:25,097
your fierce and aggressive Dou Qi

334
00:13:25,097 --> 00:13:27,138
is incompatible
with your spear technique.

335
00:13:27,977 --> 00:13:28,937
What should I do then?

336
00:13:29,258 --> 00:13:30,058
Use the source stone

337
00:13:30,058 --> 00:13:31,298
to stabilize your Dou Qi temporarily.

338
00:13:31,538 --> 00:13:32,498
Given time,

339
00:13:32,617 --> 00:13:34,857
you will surely comprehend
your own spear technique.

340
00:13:36,697 --> 00:13:37,658
Yes, Master,

341
00:13:37,857 --> 00:13:38,737
I understand.

342
00:13:42,817 --> 00:13:44,498
(You've cultivated Dou Qi, so what?)

343
00:13:44,737 --> 00:13:46,138
(You can't even control it!)

344
00:14:03,178 --> 00:14:03,937
Hong.

345
00:14:05,097 --> 00:14:05,658
Come on,

346
00:14:05,937 --> 00:14:07,097
let's eat a roasted chicken.

347
00:14:07,217 --> 00:14:07,857
Come on.

348
00:14:09,178 --> 00:14:09,737
Come on.

349
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:10,937
Where did you get this roasted chicken?

350
00:14:11,258 --> 00:14:12,658
I found a way to buy it.

351
00:14:12,658 --> 00:14:13,898
No matter where I go,

352
00:14:13,898 --> 00:14:15,498
with my smart brain

353
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:16,778
and the power of money,

354
00:14:16,778 --> 00:14:17,898
I can get

355
00:14:17,898 --> 00:14:18,778
anything I want.

356
00:14:20,658 --> 00:14:22,217
Hong, you eat first.

357
00:14:22,538 --> 00:14:23,617
I won't eat.

358
00:14:24,617 --> 00:14:25,457
You eat it.

359
00:14:26,697 --> 00:14:27,577
Fine.

360
00:14:27,817 --> 00:14:28,658
You are

361
00:14:28,658 --> 00:14:29,258
becoming more and more

362
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:30,418
like Dongbo Xueying,

363
00:14:30,577 --> 00:14:31,857
hardheaded.

364
00:14:32,857 --> 00:14:34,258
Just now, I saw him

365
00:14:34,697 --> 00:14:35,298
practicing

366
00:14:35,298 --> 00:14:36,577
in the backyard so late.

367
00:14:36,898 --> 00:14:38,097
Don't you think he's crazy?

368
00:14:38,097 --> 00:14:39,058
He's taking it too far.

369
00:14:39,058 --> 00:14:39,977
And,

370
00:14:40,378 --> 00:14:42,178
I saw the dean and Ms. Xiaoxi

371
00:14:42,178 --> 00:14:42,617
say something

372
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:43,538
to him.

373
00:14:43,737 --> 00:14:46,258
Were they giving him special treatment?

374
00:14:46,498 --> 00:14:47,737
Xueying and the dean?

375
00:14:48,378 --> 00:14:48,977
Yes.

376
00:14:49,258 --> 00:14:49,817
They even gave

377
00:14:49,817 --> 00:14:50,857
Dongbo Xueying

378
00:14:50,857 --> 00:14:51,778
a source stone.

379
00:14:51,937 --> 00:14:53,217
For us, what rare thing

380
00:14:53,217 --> 00:14:53,898
have we not seen?

381
00:14:54,018 --> 00:14:55,658
Only that ignorant man

382
00:14:55,658 --> 00:14:57,018
would treat it like a treasure.

383
00:14:57,658 --> 00:14:59,337
Xueying was seriously injured

384
00:14:59,337 --> 00:15:00,378
in the previous battle,

385
00:15:00,658 --> 00:15:03,018
so it's reasonable
for the dean to give him

386
00:15:03,337 --> 00:15:04,337
a source stone to help heal his body.

387
00:15:04,457 --> 00:15:06,697
Hong, it was a pity that you didn't go.

388
00:15:06,697 --> 00:15:07,857
If it had been you,

389
00:15:08,178 --> 00:15:09,217
would you have fought

390
00:15:09,217 --> 00:15:10,617
those demons as hard as he did?

391
00:15:10,778 --> 00:15:11,817
I think the stone

392
00:15:11,817 --> 00:15:13,138
- should be rewarded to you.
- Rong.

393
00:15:17,457 --> 00:15:18,097
Hong.

394
00:15:19,337 --> 00:15:21,018
Have some water.

395
00:15:26,817 --> 00:15:27,817
(Dean Changfeng)

396
00:15:27,817 --> 00:15:29,378
(even gave him a source stone)

397
00:15:30,217 --> 00:15:32,178
(and special treatment.)

398
00:16:04,378 --> 00:16:05,418
Everyone must have known

399
00:16:05,418 --> 00:16:06,418
about the Lu's Fort incident.

400
00:16:06,658 --> 00:16:08,138
Xueying, Puyang Bo,

401
00:16:08,258 --> 00:16:09,898
Yu Jingqiu and Kong Youyue

402
00:16:10,217 --> 00:16:11,817
faced danger without fear.

403
00:16:12,018 --> 00:16:13,418
They found the demons' traces

404
00:16:13,577 --> 00:16:15,418
and destroyed one of their branches.

405
00:16:15,937 --> 00:16:17,337
Everyone should learn from them,

406
00:16:17,498 --> 00:16:18,898
especially Dongbo Xueying

407
00:16:19,217 --> 00:16:20,298
who didn't forget to protect others

408
00:16:20,298 --> 00:16:21,418
in the face of danger

409
00:16:21,737 --> 00:16:23,418
and persists in practicing
despite his injuries.

410
00:16:24,018 --> 00:16:24,577
I hope you all

411
00:16:24,617 --> 00:16:26,217
emulate his spirit.

412
00:16:26,857 --> 00:16:28,018
You bear the heavy responsibility

413
00:16:28,178 --> 00:16:29,658
of protecting the Xia Clan.

414
00:16:29,658 --> 00:16:31,378
You can't let your guard down
even for a moment.

415
00:16:32,217 --> 00:16:34,217
- Yes, Dean.
- Yes, Dean.

416
00:16:37,778 --> 00:16:38,457
Xueying,

417
00:16:38,658 --> 00:16:39,298
I'm sure

418
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:40,658
you will become
a Transcendent Knight in the future.

419
00:16:41,097 --> 00:16:41,697
As for me,

420
00:16:41,737 --> 00:16:43,337
if I can't have a Transcendent wife,

421
00:16:43,337 --> 00:16:44,298
having a Transcendent buddy

422
00:16:44,298 --> 00:16:45,298
like you isn't bad.

423
00:16:46,178 --> 00:16:46,937
Don't make fun of me.

424
00:16:52,018 --> 00:16:52,817
(No.)

425
00:16:53,058 --> 00:16:53,857
(I have to knock him)

426
00:16:53,857 --> 00:16:55,097
(off his high horse.)

427
00:16:55,378 --> 00:16:56,577
(He's injured now.)

428
00:16:56,577 --> 00:16:57,778
(He definitely can't beat me.)

429
00:17:01,138 --> 00:17:02,577
After hearing people

430
00:17:02,737 --> 00:17:03,977
speak so highly of you,

431
00:17:04,417 --> 00:17:06,617
I'd like to see how good you really are.

432
00:17:07,218 --> 00:17:08,018
Everyone,

433
00:17:08,298 --> 00:17:09,258
how about we

434
00:17:09,258 --> 00:17:11,617
spar with Dongbo Xueying

435
00:17:11,738 --> 00:17:13,258
to improve our strength together?

436
00:17:13,258 --> 00:17:14,617
Is it a good idea?

437
00:17:14,657 --> 00:17:15,698
Yes, it is! Yes!

438
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:16,377
- Yes!
- Yes!

439
00:17:16,377 --> 00:17:17,857
Xueying's injury hasn't healed yet,

440
00:17:17,857 --> 00:17:19,058
and he's still not back
to full strength.

441
00:17:19,177 --> 00:17:20,857
He'd better not practice
with others right now.

442
00:17:21,377 --> 00:17:22,218
That's right.

443
00:17:22,458 --> 00:17:23,817
He hasn't fully recovered,

444
00:17:24,097 --> 00:17:25,337
and you want to compete with him now.

445
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:26,617
What kind of bad idea is this?

446
00:17:28,097 --> 00:17:29,498
Is this great hero

447
00:17:29,498 --> 00:17:31,097
that weak?

448
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:32,698
How about this, Dongbo Xueying?

449
00:17:32,978 --> 00:17:33,857
You say something.

450
00:17:33,978 --> 00:17:35,738
If you say you're afraid to fight

451
00:17:35,738 --> 00:17:36,817
or can't fight,

452
00:17:37,097 --> 00:17:38,817
then we won't target you.

453
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:39,817
Is that okay?

454
00:17:40,857 --> 00:17:42,577
Xueying, don't listen to him.

455
00:17:42,778 --> 00:17:44,177
Why should you have to fight him

456
00:17:44,177 --> 00:17:45,538
just because he says so?

457
00:17:45,538 --> 00:17:46,738
Don't fall for it.

458
00:17:47,377 --> 00:17:48,337
Si Borong,

459
00:17:48,617 --> 00:17:49,577
if you really want

460
00:17:49,577 --> 00:17:50,577
to spar,

461
00:17:50,577 --> 00:17:52,218
why not spar with me first?

462
00:17:52,258 --> 00:17:53,617
I don't fight girls.

463
00:17:53,938 --> 00:17:55,498
Let's see who's stronger between us.

464
00:18:02,058 --> 00:18:02,498
Sister.

465
00:18:04,778 --> 00:18:05,897
If you want to spar,

466
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:06,857
I'll spar with you.

467
00:18:07,137 --> 00:18:08,177
But I have to tell you,

468
00:18:08,458 --> 00:18:09,738
I'm not some great hero,

469
00:18:09,978 --> 00:18:11,577
and my cultivation level
is quite inferior.

470
00:18:12,417 --> 00:18:14,097
But I'd also like to learn from you.

471
00:18:14,458 --> 00:18:15,337
Look at him.

472
00:18:15,657 --> 00:18:16,817
After the battle at Lu's Fort,

473
00:18:16,817 --> 00:18:18,417
Dongbo Xueying

474
00:18:18,417 --> 00:18:19,738
has already reached
the Silver Moon Level.

475
00:18:19,897 --> 00:18:22,137
I can't wait to see what you've got.

476
00:18:22,577 --> 00:18:23,657
Come on.

477
00:18:24,298 --> 00:18:25,298
Let's start it.

478
00:18:26,817 --> 00:18:27,417
Come on.

479
00:18:38,817 --> 00:18:40,177
It's such a great opportunity.

480
00:18:40,177 --> 00:18:41,417
Who wants to go first?

481
00:18:41,978 --> 00:18:42,978
Si Borong,

482
00:18:43,337 --> 00:18:44,538
are you done yet?

483
00:18:44,538 --> 00:18:45,657
You suggested fighting Xueying.

484
00:18:45,657 --> 00:18:46,337
Why don't you go first?

485
00:18:46,337 --> 00:18:47,177
Will you fight or not?

486
00:18:47,177 --> 00:18:48,218
If you won't, then stop talking.

487
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:50,218
Of course, I won't fight.

488
00:18:50,417 --> 00:18:52,258
I admit I can't beat Xueying,

489
00:18:52,337 --> 00:18:53,498
and with a great buddy

490
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:54,298
like him,

491
00:18:54,298 --> 00:18:55,018
nobody dares to bully me.

492
00:18:55,018 --> 00:18:55,698
Do you have one?

493
00:18:55,978 --> 00:18:56,698
Puyang Bo,

494
00:18:56,897 --> 00:18:58,377
you're just a coward.

495
00:18:58,377 --> 00:18:59,538
Stop talking nonsense.

496
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:00,577
Will you fight or not?

497
00:19:02,498 --> 00:19:03,058
Mo Zhu,

498
00:19:04,978 --> 00:19:05,577
you go.

499
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:07,738
Fight him!

500
00:19:08,137 --> 00:19:08,817
Don't step back.

501
00:19:08,817 --> 00:19:09,498
Stand there.

502
00:19:09,498 --> 00:19:10,177
No, no.

503
00:19:12,698 --> 00:19:14,097
He, he...

504
00:19:14,337 --> 00:19:14,738
He...

505
00:19:14,738 --> 00:19:15,458
What are you doing?

506
00:19:15,978 --> 00:19:16,778
Then I'll go first.

507
00:19:17,538 --> 00:19:18,337
Xueying,

508
00:19:19,657 --> 00:19:20,458
bring it on.

509
00:19:21,018 --> 00:19:21,817
Kong Hao,

510
00:19:22,097 --> 00:19:23,177
what's gotten into you?

511
00:19:23,298 --> 00:19:23,698
Sister,

512
00:19:24,137 --> 00:19:25,738
Xueying is highly skilled
in martial arts.

513
00:19:25,738 --> 00:19:27,058
I want to spar with him

514
00:19:27,058 --> 00:19:27,698
to learn and improve, you know?

515
00:19:27,698 --> 00:19:28,938
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

516
00:19:29,857 --> 00:19:31,137
Just a friendly spar.

517
00:19:33,458 --> 00:19:34,617
Youyue, don't worry.

518
00:19:35,177 --> 00:19:36,177
Xueying won't lose.

519
00:19:36,617 --> 00:19:38,058
It's not your brother
who's getting beaten.

520
00:19:38,337 --> 00:19:39,498
Then you can be even more assured.

521
00:19:39,498 --> 00:19:40,978
Xueying won't hurt Kong Hao.

522
00:19:41,538 --> 00:19:43,018
But you should be careful
not to hurt yourself.

523
00:19:44,657 --> 00:19:45,377
It's okay.

524
00:19:45,417 --> 00:19:46,817
Kong Hao, come on.

525
00:20:19,417 --> 00:20:19,897
Brother,

526
00:20:19,978 --> 00:20:20,817
are you okay?

527
00:20:20,817 --> 00:20:21,377
I'm fine.

528
00:20:24,298 --> 00:20:25,337
Let me fight you.

529
00:20:57,538 --> 00:20:58,938
Xueying, you're amazing.

530
00:20:59,817 --> 00:21:00,657
Xueying is truly incredible.

531
00:21:00,657 --> 00:21:01,857
Xueying is so powerful.

532
00:21:02,738 --> 00:21:03,577
Hurry up, it's your turn.

533
00:21:03,698 --> 00:21:04,738
It's your turn, Si Borong.

534
00:21:04,738 --> 00:21:05,738
Go on, get out there!

535
00:21:05,738 --> 00:21:06,458
Who suggested it just now?

536
00:21:06,458 --> 00:21:06,778
Alright, I will.

537
00:21:06,778 --> 00:21:07,577
Stop dawdling, hurry up.

538
00:21:08,058 --> 00:21:08,857
You can do it.

539
00:21:08,857 --> 00:21:09,817
- Come on.
- You can do it!

540
00:21:09,817 --> 00:21:10,417
Come on.

541
00:21:32,778 --> 00:21:33,177
Si Borong.

542
00:21:33,177 --> 00:21:33,857
Don't come over.

543
00:21:36,058 --> 00:21:37,058
Borong, are you okay?

544
00:21:37,298 --> 00:21:39,337
Dongbo Xueying, what do you mean?

545
00:21:39,417 --> 00:21:41,097
I just suggested sparring.

546
00:21:41,097 --> 00:21:41,538
Why did you

547
00:21:41,538 --> 00:21:42,778
have to go so hard?

548
00:21:42,778 --> 00:21:43,538
(What happened?)

549
00:21:43,897 --> 00:21:45,417
(I clearly held back just now.)

550
00:21:45,458 --> 00:21:46,617
I feel like my internal organs

551
00:21:46,617 --> 00:21:47,617
are shattered.

552
00:21:48,377 --> 00:21:49,377
I admit you're strong,

553
00:21:49,377 --> 00:21:50,137
but that's enough.

554
00:21:50,337 --> 00:21:51,778
Why did you come at me like that?

555
00:21:58,938 --> 00:21:59,857
Dongbo Xueying,

556
00:22:00,337 --> 00:22:02,018
it was just a friendly spar.

557
00:22:02,498 --> 00:22:04,137
Did you have to be so ruthless?

558
00:22:04,417 --> 00:22:05,018
I'm sorry.

559
00:22:05,298 --> 00:22:06,218
I didn't do it on purpose.

560
00:22:06,657 --> 00:22:07,817
Maybe I didn't control

561
00:22:07,817 --> 00:22:08,738
Dou Qi within me.

562
00:22:08,978 --> 00:22:10,058
A person who can't even control

563
00:22:10,058 --> 00:22:11,058
his own power

564
00:22:11,218 --> 00:22:12,458
and harms the innocent.

565
00:22:12,897 --> 00:22:14,538
What's the difference
between him and the demons?

566
00:22:15,698 --> 00:22:16,458
A true master

567
00:22:16,458 --> 00:22:17,617
should be able
to control his power freely.

568
00:22:18,018 --> 00:22:19,298
How can he not control

569
00:22:19,298 --> 00:22:20,058
his own Dou Qi?

570
00:22:20,058 --> 00:22:21,137
Situ Hong,

571
00:22:21,177 --> 00:22:22,538
Xueying certainly didn't mean

572
00:22:22,538 --> 00:22:23,817
to hurt Si Borong.

573
00:22:23,938 --> 00:22:25,218
Who knows if he's faking it or not?

574
00:22:25,218 --> 00:22:25,458
You...

575
00:22:25,498 --> 00:22:26,177
Fine.

576
00:22:27,137 --> 00:22:29,137
Since Si Borong is not strong enough,

577
00:22:33,817 --> 00:22:34,817
how about you and I

578
00:22:36,778 --> 00:22:38,577
spar a little?

579
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:40,817
Sorry, Situ Hong,

580
00:22:41,337 --> 00:22:42,778
I'm afraid I will lose control
of my Dou Qi again

581
00:22:42,778 --> 00:22:43,577
and hurt you.

582
00:22:44,018 --> 00:22:45,458
What big talk!

583
00:22:48,857 --> 00:22:50,417
(If I don't defeat you today,)

584
00:22:50,738 --> 00:22:51,538
(later on,)

585
00:22:51,978 --> 00:22:53,857
(you'll rub it in my face.)

586
00:23:25,538 --> 00:23:27,177
Didn't he say it was a friendly spar?

587
00:23:27,258 --> 00:23:27,897
Xueying.

588
00:23:28,337 --> 00:23:29,538
Are you okay, Xueying?

589
00:23:29,538 --> 00:23:30,218
Are you alright?

590
00:23:30,657 --> 00:23:31,258
Enough.

591
00:23:31,498 --> 00:23:32,458
Just stop it.

592
00:23:32,458 --> 00:23:33,498
That's it for today.

593
00:23:33,778 --> 00:23:35,617
Xueying, are you okay?

594
00:23:36,938 --> 00:23:37,857
Situ Hong,

595
00:23:38,657 --> 00:23:39,738
we're all fellow disciples.

596
00:23:39,938 --> 00:23:40,817
It's just a friendly spar.

597
00:23:40,938 --> 00:23:42,177
Why did you have to hit

598
00:23:42,177 --> 00:23:43,058
Xueying so hard?

599
00:23:45,417 --> 00:23:46,218
When he hurt

600
00:23:46,218 --> 00:23:47,218
my cousin just now,

601
00:23:48,018 --> 00:23:49,577
why didn't any of you say anything?

602
00:23:50,698 --> 00:23:51,938
You should first be concerned

603
00:23:51,938 --> 00:23:53,137
about your cousin's injuries.

604
00:23:53,617 --> 00:23:54,698
If the fight continues,

605
00:23:55,018 --> 00:23:55,778
I'm afraid his injuries

606
00:23:55,778 --> 00:23:57,018
will become even more severe.

607
00:23:57,337 --> 00:23:58,097
Didn't he just say

608
00:23:58,097 --> 00:23:59,417
that all his internal organs
were nearly shattered?

609
00:24:00,377 --> 00:24:01,137
Si Borong,

610
00:24:01,657 --> 00:24:02,897
I saw you clearly covering

611
00:24:02,897 --> 00:24:03,817
your left chest just now.

612
00:24:04,177 --> 00:24:06,298
Why is it the right chest now?

613
00:24:09,817 --> 00:24:10,938
Is that so?

614
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:14,137
My right chest hurts too.

615
00:24:14,177 --> 00:24:15,177
Everywhere hurts.

616
00:24:16,698 --> 00:24:17,377
Hong,

617
00:24:18,978 --> 00:24:20,058
I feel terrible.

618
00:24:20,617 --> 00:24:22,137
I'll go back to rest for a while.

619
00:24:40,337 --> 00:24:41,738
I feel like Situ Hong

620
00:24:41,857 --> 00:24:43,498
might have some hostility towards you.

621
00:24:44,018 --> 00:24:45,498
After all, I injured Si Borong.

622
00:24:46,617 --> 00:24:47,337
So,

623
00:24:47,617 --> 00:24:49,258
I can understand
his hostility towards me.

624
00:24:49,498 --> 00:24:50,978
You can't really believe

625
00:24:50,978 --> 00:24:52,097
Si Borong was hurt by you?

626
00:24:52,617 --> 00:24:54,018
I think there's a high chance

627
00:24:54,018 --> 00:24:54,978
that he was faking it.

628
00:24:55,337 --> 00:24:56,337
But I really did knock

629
00:24:56,337 --> 00:24:57,377
him to the ground.

630
00:24:59,698 --> 00:25:00,817
Don't worry about it now.

631
00:25:00,817 --> 00:25:02,577
Focus on your body.

632
00:25:04,617 --> 00:25:05,738
Xueying,

633
00:25:06,657 --> 00:25:07,617
eat this Lingcao herb soup

634
00:25:07,617 --> 00:25:08,817
while it's still hot.

635
00:25:09,218 --> 00:25:10,137
Situ Hong

636
00:25:10,137 --> 00:25:11,058
is really despicable.

637
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,417
He said it was just a friendly spar,

638
00:25:12,417 --> 00:25:13,458
but he still injured you.

639
00:25:13,498 --> 00:25:15,137
You really shouldn't have held back.

640
00:25:16,738 --> 00:25:17,897
This soup

641
00:25:17,897 --> 00:25:18,978
is very effective.

642
00:25:20,577 --> 00:25:21,817
I forgot to add salt.

643
00:25:21,938 --> 00:25:22,817
You hold on to it.

644
00:25:23,617 --> 00:25:24,417
I'll go get the salt.

645
00:25:28,417 --> 00:25:29,058
Youyue.

646
00:25:30,538 --> 00:25:32,137
Xueying, I brought you some medicine.

647
00:25:32,577 --> 00:25:34,218
The dean said it can stabilize
the disorder in your body.

648
00:25:34,218 --> 00:25:35,458
Take it once every two hours.

649
00:25:35,458 --> 00:25:36,097
Thank you.

650
00:25:38,218 --> 00:25:39,377
Nourishing soup again?

651
00:25:39,657 --> 00:25:40,218
You can't eat it.

652
00:25:40,218 --> 00:25:41,258
Let me help you with this.

653
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:52,897
Puyang Bo.

654
00:25:54,258 --> 00:25:54,657
You...

655
00:25:55,538 --> 00:25:55,938
What's wrong?

656
00:25:55,938 --> 00:25:56,377
You...

657
00:25:56,778 --> 00:25:58,218
You've gone too far!

658
00:25:58,218 --> 00:25:58,938
No, no.

659
00:25:58,938 --> 00:25:59,857
I-I-I didn't eat the soup.

660
00:25:59,897 --> 00:26:00,417
It wasn't me.

661
00:26:00,417 --> 00:26:00,978
It was Xueying.

662
00:26:00,978 --> 00:26:01,978
Xueying, you ate it, right?

663
00:26:04,258 --> 00:26:05,738
The evidence is right on your face,

664
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,137
yet you still say you didn't eat it?

665
00:26:07,137 --> 00:26:08,377
You're still trying to argue?

666
00:26:09,298 --> 00:26:10,018
It tasted pretty good.

667
00:26:10,137 --> 00:26:10,938
No, no!

668
00:26:10,938 --> 00:26:11,657
Give me back my soup!

669
00:26:11,657 --> 00:26:12,258
I didn't want to eat it,

670
00:26:12,258 --> 00:26:13,018
but Xueying couldn't eat it.

671
00:26:13,018 --> 00:26:13,897
Give me back my soup!

672
00:26:15,018 --> 00:26:16,857
If that is good for you,

673
00:26:16,857 --> 00:26:18,058
you should eat it.

674
00:26:19,657 --> 00:26:21,058
I really can't eat it,

675
00:26:21,177 --> 00:26:22,458
because it contains Deerhorn Glue.

676
00:26:22,857 --> 00:26:23,857
I can't eat that stuff.

677
00:26:26,337 --> 00:26:27,897
So you didn't eat it
because you couldn't,

678
00:26:28,097 --> 00:26:29,778
not because you didn't want to.

679
00:26:31,897 --> 00:26:33,177
I just didn't want to eat it.

680
00:26:33,978 --> 00:26:35,097
I only want

681
00:26:35,417 --> 00:26:36,298
the medicine you make for me.

682
00:26:37,817 --> 00:26:38,577
Jingqiu,

683
00:26:38,897 --> 00:26:39,817
let's go catch some fish.

684
00:26:46,018 --> 00:26:46,938
No, no!

685
00:26:46,938 --> 00:26:47,778
It hurts!

686
00:26:47,778 --> 00:26:49,218
Youyue, it really hurts.

687
00:26:51,897 --> 00:26:52,857
Darn you!

688
00:26:52,938 --> 00:26:53,938
You better make me

689
00:26:53,938 --> 00:26:55,137
the exact same soup right now,

690
00:26:55,137 --> 00:26:56,258
or I won't let you off.

691
00:26:57,258 --> 00:26:58,498
Youyue, let me explain.

692
00:26:58,498 --> 00:27:00,018
It was really Xueying
who asked me to eat it.

693
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:01,018
Not me.

694
00:27:01,258 --> 00:27:02,657
He can't eat your soup.

695
00:27:02,657 --> 00:27:04,018
He said he was over-nourished as a boy.

696
00:27:04,018 --> 00:27:05,298
And now his Dou Qi is too vigorous,

697
00:27:05,298 --> 00:27:06,617
like a flame leaping out.

698
00:27:06,617 --> 00:27:07,857
How could he eat this kind of thing?

699
00:27:07,857 --> 00:27:08,978
It's like pouring oil on a fire.

700
00:27:09,738 --> 00:27:11,018
Is what you said

701
00:27:11,577 --> 00:27:12,337
all true?

702
00:27:12,337 --> 00:27:13,258
Yeah.

703
00:27:13,258 --> 00:27:14,337
I swear to God.

704
00:27:14,337 --> 00:27:15,617
How could I possibly lie to you?

705
00:27:22,058 --> 00:27:23,417
Since Xueying

706
00:27:23,417 --> 00:27:24,978
can't eat nourishing things,

707
00:27:25,258 --> 00:27:25,978
I will make

708
00:27:25,978 --> 00:27:27,458
something light instead for him.

709
00:27:27,978 --> 00:27:30,298
Plain congee and vegetable soup.

710
00:27:31,417 --> 00:27:32,458
Or maybe I'll make

711
00:27:32,458 --> 00:27:34,058
an egg custard for him.

712
00:27:35,097 --> 00:27:35,938
Yes!

713
00:27:37,978 --> 00:27:38,738
Youyue,

714
00:27:39,377 --> 00:27:41,018
you don't have to do so much.

715
00:27:41,218 --> 00:27:41,817
Everyone is

716
00:27:41,817 --> 00:27:43,177
very concerned about Xueying.

717
00:27:43,177 --> 00:27:44,778
Master Bu and the dean

718
00:27:44,778 --> 00:27:45,698
gave him a source stone

719
00:27:45,698 --> 00:27:46,778
to help him recover his Dou Qi.

720
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,018
Jingqiu even specially made him

721
00:27:49,018 --> 00:27:50,258
a nourishing soup.

722
00:27:50,817 --> 00:27:52,258
How many stomachs does he have?

723
00:27:52,258 --> 00:27:53,657
Can he eat that much?

724
00:27:54,738 --> 00:27:56,337
So Xueying ate up

725
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:57,577
the nourishing soup

726
00:27:57,897 --> 00:27:59,097
that Yu Jingqiu made for him?

727
00:27:59,538 --> 00:28:00,177
Yeah.

728
00:28:00,258 --> 00:28:01,417
He's been eating her soup for days.

729
00:28:01,617 --> 00:28:02,337
So,

730
00:28:02,337 --> 00:28:03,377
you can rest assured.

731
00:28:03,377 --> 00:28:04,458
Xueying will be fine.

732
00:28:09,417 --> 00:28:11,458
(He had the soup Jingqiu gave him)

733
00:28:12,377 --> 00:28:14,377
(but gave my soup to someone else.)

734
00:28:17,458 --> 00:28:18,218
Youyue.

735
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:32,218
Hong.

736
00:28:32,857 --> 00:28:33,778
Are your injuries okay?

737
00:28:34,577 --> 00:28:36,137
I'm good. I was pretending.

738
00:28:36,417 --> 00:28:37,218
Pretending?

739
00:28:37,377 --> 00:28:38,577
I just don't like him

740
00:28:38,577 --> 00:28:39,498
and wanted to teach him a lesson.

741
00:28:39,498 --> 00:28:40,857
You're always up to no good.

742
00:28:40,857 --> 00:28:42,258
Only doing these crooked things.

743
00:28:42,417 --> 00:28:43,377
Situ Hong,

744
00:28:43,817 --> 00:28:44,978
have you gone mad?

745
00:28:44,978 --> 00:28:46,177
Defending Dongbo Xueying?

746
00:28:46,177 --> 00:28:46,938
I'm not defending

747
00:28:46,938 --> 00:28:48,058
him.

748
00:28:48,417 --> 00:28:49,218
We should

749
00:28:49,218 --> 00:28:50,337
rely on our own efforts

750
00:28:50,698 --> 00:28:52,018
to get first place at Changfeng Academy.

751
00:28:52,177 --> 00:28:52,738
This way,

752
00:28:53,377 --> 00:28:55,058
we won't let Aunt down

753
00:28:55,258 --> 00:28:56,177
and make up for our family's mistake

754
00:28:56,177 --> 00:28:57,617
in guarding the Demon Well.

755
00:28:57,857 --> 00:28:59,058
Even Aunt, a Transcendent Knight,

756
00:28:59,058 --> 00:29:00,458
gets bullied by the council.

757
00:29:00,978 --> 00:29:01,978
If the two of us want

758
00:29:01,978 --> 00:29:03,137
to reach Aunt's cultivation level,

759
00:29:03,137 --> 00:29:04,298
how long will it take?

760
00:29:04,417 --> 00:29:05,298
Even when our hair and beards

761
00:29:05,298 --> 00:29:06,938
turn white,

762
00:29:06,978 --> 00:29:08,337
we're still there, practicing bitterly.

763
00:29:08,337 --> 00:29:08,817
You!

764
00:29:09,137 --> 00:29:10,218
You what?

765
00:29:11,817 --> 00:29:13,577
You're simply beyond help.

766
00:29:17,698 --> 00:29:18,938
I brought you some buns.

767
00:29:19,018 --> 00:29:19,938
I'm sorry

768
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:20,657
about hurting you today.

769
00:29:23,177 --> 00:29:24,298
Don't take your anger out on the food.

770
00:29:24,657 --> 00:29:25,617
Spare me

771
00:29:25,617 --> 00:29:26,657
the crocodile tears, okay?

772
00:29:27,058 --> 00:29:27,938
What do you mean by that?

773
00:29:28,137 --> 00:29:29,458
Don't pretend.

774
00:29:30,417 --> 00:29:31,258
You tried to get close to the dean,

775
00:29:31,258 --> 00:29:32,538
letting him give you a source stone.

776
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:34,018
And everyone calls you the great hero

777
00:29:34,018 --> 00:29:34,817
of the academy.

778
00:29:34,817 --> 00:29:35,778
Everyone admires you.

779
00:29:35,817 --> 00:29:36,698
Are you satisfied now?

780
00:29:39,577 --> 00:29:40,698
If that's what you think,

781
00:29:41,097 --> 00:29:42,177
then I won't explain.

782
00:30:15,417 --> 00:30:16,817
(Can't I really control)

783
00:30:16,817 --> 00:30:17,857
(my Dou Qi?)

784
00:30:24,097 --> 00:30:24,978
Puyang Bo.

785
00:30:26,337 --> 00:30:26,657
How are you?

786
00:30:27,218 --> 00:30:28,058
It's okay.

787
00:30:28,058 --> 00:30:28,498
Come on.

788
00:30:29,177 --> 00:30:29,657
Are you okay?

789
00:30:29,938 --> 00:30:30,857
Yeah.

790
00:30:31,018 --> 00:30:32,058
I have a lot of flesh on me.

791
00:30:32,058 --> 00:30:32,938
I'm not that delicate.

792
00:30:33,058 --> 00:30:34,337
When I was a kid, my father hit me

793
00:30:34,337 --> 00:30:35,698
and I once fell off the roof,

794
00:30:35,698 --> 00:30:37,177
but I was still fine.

795
00:30:38,897 --> 00:30:40,258
Before I had Dou Qi,

796
00:30:40,778 --> 00:30:42,337
I dreamed of cultivating it.

797
00:30:42,617 --> 00:30:44,058
But now it's erupted,

798
00:30:44,698 --> 00:30:46,097
and I always feel
like I can't control it,

799
00:30:46,657 --> 00:30:47,337
As if there's a force

800
00:30:47,337 --> 00:30:48,698
trying to burst out from inside me.

801
00:30:49,258 --> 00:30:50,577
Xueying, it's okay,

802
00:30:50,577 --> 00:30:51,698
I know you didn't mean to.

803
00:30:51,698 --> 00:30:53,097
See, I'm fine.

804
00:30:54,857 --> 00:30:55,577
I'm afraid.

805
00:30:56,018 --> 00:30:57,018
Afraid I can't control it.

806
00:30:57,298 --> 00:30:58,337
I'm afraid I can't control

807
00:30:58,337 --> 00:30:59,417
the Dou Qi within me.

808
00:31:00,417 --> 00:31:01,097
Alright.

809
00:31:01,498 --> 00:31:02,538
Are you too tired?

810
00:31:02,538 --> 00:31:03,698
Go back and rest for a while.

811
00:31:04,337 --> 00:31:05,218
Cultivation is important,

812
00:31:05,218 --> 00:31:06,617
but so is rest.

813
00:31:06,897 --> 00:31:08,337
(Although I didn't hurt him,)

814
00:31:08,657 --> 00:31:09,738
(I could feel)

815
00:31:10,018 --> 00:31:10,657
(at that moment, my Dou Qi)

816
00:31:10,657 --> 00:31:11,857
(was almost uncontrollable again.)

817
00:31:12,258 --> 00:31:13,258
(If I truly can't control)

818
00:31:13,258 --> 00:31:14,097
(the Dou Qi within me,)

819
00:31:14,417 --> 00:31:15,617
(what's the difference,
as Situ Hong said,)

820
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:17,417
(between me and a demon?)

821
00:31:18,097 --> 00:31:18,938
I'll practice for a while longer.

822
00:31:19,097 --> 00:31:19,778
You go back.

823
00:31:20,018 --> 00:31:21,298
Still practicing?

824
00:31:22,097 --> 00:31:23,657
I can't sleep if I go back now, anyway.

825
00:31:23,978 --> 00:31:24,577
Xueying,

826
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:26,417
if the whole academy

827
00:31:26,417 --> 00:31:27,778
has only one Transcendent Knight,

828
00:31:27,897 --> 00:31:28,978
it must be you.

829
00:31:30,698 --> 00:31:31,938
I want to be Transcendent.

830
00:31:32,538 --> 00:31:33,538
But I have

831
00:31:33,817 --> 00:31:34,458
other more important things

832
00:31:34,458 --> 00:31:35,258
to do.

833
00:31:36,177 --> 00:31:37,617
Anyway, I have faith in you.

834
00:31:37,817 --> 00:31:38,377
I'm leaving.

835
00:31:53,778 --> 00:31:55,018
(They even gave)

836
00:31:55,018 --> 00:31:56,417
(Dongbo Xueying a source stone.)

837
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,337
And,

838
00:31:57,657 --> 00:31:59,058
I saw the dean and Ms. Xiaoxi

839
00:31:59,058 --> 00:31:59,738
say something

840
00:31:59,738 --> 00:32:00,538
to him.

841
00:32:01,018 --> 00:32:03,657
Could they be giving him
special treatment?

842
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:07,218
Xueying was injured

843
00:32:07,218 --> 00:32:08,617
while eliminating the demons' branch

844
00:32:08,617 --> 00:32:09,498
at Lu's Fort.

845
00:32:09,778 --> 00:32:11,577
He's the great hero of our academy.

846
00:32:12,417 --> 00:32:13,738
Especially Dongbo Xueying

847
00:32:13,738 --> 00:32:14,498
who didn't forget to protect others

848
00:32:14,498 --> 00:32:15,538
in the face of danger

849
00:32:16,137 --> 00:32:17,538
and persists in practicing
despite his injuries.

850
00:32:18,137 --> 00:32:18,738
I hope you all

851
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,778
emulate his spirit.

852
00:33:24,657 --> 00:33:26,298
Just now you almost lost
control of your Dou Qi

853
00:33:26,857 --> 00:33:28,258
because it is

854
00:33:28,498 --> 00:33:29,337
too strong

855
00:33:29,577 --> 00:33:30,938
and you're too eager for success.

856
00:33:31,577 --> 00:33:33,058
That situation is very dangerous.

857
00:33:33,298 --> 00:33:34,218
If you're not careful,

858
00:33:34,218 --> 00:33:35,377
your meridians could burst,

859
00:33:35,657 --> 00:33:36,738
endangering your life.

860
00:33:37,137 --> 00:33:37,817
Master,

861
00:33:38,698 --> 00:33:40,177
I can't control my Dou Qi.

862
00:33:40,738 --> 00:33:41,657
If I have an episode

863
00:33:41,657 --> 00:33:42,738
and I can't control it,

864
00:33:44,018 --> 00:33:45,018
will I die?

865
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,617
Xueying, don't be too nervous.

866
00:33:48,018 --> 00:33:49,778
Cultivation should avoid impatience.

867
00:33:50,577 --> 00:33:52,137
In the past, there was
a genius cultivator

868
00:33:52,817 --> 00:33:54,377
who, because of eagerness for success,

869
00:33:55,177 --> 00:33:56,778
eventually died of burst meridians.

870
00:33:57,738 --> 00:33:58,617
Only those who can control

871
00:33:58,617 --> 00:33:59,538
their own power

872
00:33:59,738 --> 00:34:01,377
can become true powerhouses.

873
00:34:03,657 --> 00:34:04,218
Martial arts skills

874
00:34:04,218 --> 00:34:05,458
can be cultivated gradually.

875
00:34:06,018 --> 00:34:07,417
Even a person's thoughts

876
00:34:07,778 --> 00:34:08,498
can make martial arts

877
00:34:08,498 --> 00:34:09,577
have endless variations.

878
00:34:10,137 --> 00:34:11,257
In the future, not only for practice,

879
00:34:11,458 --> 00:34:12,338
but for anything,

880
00:34:12,458 --> 00:34:13,657
you can come to me.

881
00:34:15,418 --> 00:34:16,137
I understand.

882
00:34:16,418 --> 00:34:17,217
Thank you, Master.

883
00:34:18,617 --> 00:34:20,018
(I must advance)

884
00:34:20,538 --> 00:34:22,097
(and stabilize my Dou Qi
as soon as possible)

885
00:34:23,058 --> 00:34:24,458
(to rescue my mother early.)

886
00:34:25,976 --> 00:34:28,216
(Leichao Sea Cliff)

887
00:34:48,177 --> 00:34:49,217
Second Priest,

888
00:34:49,938 --> 00:34:50,978
what brings

889
00:34:50,978 --> 00:34:52,217
you here today?

890
00:34:54,657 --> 00:34:55,777
Is it

891
00:34:56,418 --> 00:34:57,338
Moyang Yu?

892
00:34:57,418 --> 00:34:58,858
She's not needed for now.

893
00:34:59,538 --> 00:35:00,338
Let me ask you.

894
00:35:00,777 --> 00:35:02,577
Do you own an alchemy workshop?

895
00:35:02,818 --> 00:35:03,657
I have one

896
00:35:03,657 --> 00:35:05,617
by the East Lake.

897
00:35:05,617 --> 00:35:06,217
Good.

898
00:35:06,697 --> 00:35:07,898
Within ten days,

899
00:35:08,458 --> 00:35:10,378
forge ten Bloodshed Weapons for me.

900
00:35:11,458 --> 00:35:12,858
They are not

901
00:35:12,858 --> 00:35:14,378
ordinary weapons.

902
00:35:14,938 --> 00:35:16,418
The time is so short.

903
00:35:16,858 --> 00:35:18,058
I-I-I'm afraid...

904
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,577
If you can't do it, it's fine.

905
00:35:19,777 --> 00:35:21,177
The skills from the half

906
00:35:21,177 --> 00:35:22,938
of the Demonic Secret Manual

907
00:35:22,938 --> 00:35:24,137
which you're been practicing

908
00:35:24,137 --> 00:35:25,617
will backfire on you.

909
00:35:25,777 --> 00:35:27,058
And by then, it will consume

910
00:35:27,058 --> 00:35:28,217
all of your lifelong cultivation.

911
00:35:29,498 --> 00:35:30,297
That doesn't sound good.

912
00:35:48,018 --> 00:35:49,938
- Greetings, Fort Master.
- Greetings, Fort Master.

913
00:35:51,737 --> 00:35:53,378
Thank you for your hard work.

914
00:36:00,978 --> 00:36:02,378
You don't have to be that polite.

915
00:36:02,818 --> 00:36:04,018
I'm here today

916
00:36:04,137 --> 00:36:05,978
to ask you to forge

917
00:36:06,538 --> 00:36:08,617
a few important weapons

918
00:36:08,617 --> 00:36:09,697
within ten days.

919
00:36:10,458 --> 00:36:11,418
What kind of weapons?

920
00:36:11,697 --> 00:36:13,378
Bloodshed Weapons.

921
00:36:13,617 --> 00:36:15,018
- Bloodshed Weapons.
- Bloodshed Weapons.

922
00:36:15,217 --> 00:36:16,538
Well...

923
00:36:21,697 --> 00:36:24,217
We'll give you

924
00:36:24,978 --> 00:36:26,378
this precious Blood Spirit Stone

925
00:36:26,418 --> 00:36:27,378
for the forging

926
00:36:27,978 --> 00:36:29,978
of the Bloodshed Weapons.

927
00:36:30,697 --> 00:36:32,137
We will complete it

928
00:36:32,498 --> 00:36:33,737
as soon as possible.

929
00:36:35,018 --> 00:36:36,617
I want ten.

930
00:36:36,617 --> 00:36:38,177
- Ten?
- Ten?

931
00:36:38,217 --> 00:36:39,137
- Ten?
- How?

932
00:36:39,137 --> 00:36:40,058
How is that even possible?

933
00:36:40,058 --> 00:36:41,378
- It is too many, isn't it?
- Yeah.

934
00:36:41,378 --> 00:36:42,898
Ten Bloodshed Weapons

935
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,378
within ten days.

936
00:36:44,378 --> 00:36:45,418
That's impossible.

937
00:36:45,418 --> 00:36:46,378
Master Moyang,

938
00:36:46,777 --> 00:36:48,458
you're asking for our lives.

939
00:36:48,458 --> 00:36:50,018
Yeah. The preciousness
of the Bloodshed Weapons

940
00:36:50,018 --> 00:36:50,498
lies not only

941
00:36:50,498 --> 00:36:51,538
in the rarity of Blood Spirit Stones,

942
00:36:51,538 --> 00:36:52,458
but in the forging process

943
00:36:52,538 --> 00:36:53,577
which is a whole lot more complicated

944
00:36:53,577 --> 00:36:54,697
than that of ordinary weapons.

945
00:36:56,297 --> 00:36:57,177
Yes.

946
00:36:59,058 --> 00:37:00,018
Master.

947
00:37:04,418 --> 00:37:06,697
Does anyone else have something to say?

948
00:37:08,657 --> 00:37:09,617
Your Lordship,

949
00:37:09,858 --> 00:37:10,978
please forgive my bluntness.

950
00:37:11,217 --> 00:37:12,898
Even if you kill all of us,

951
00:37:13,338 --> 00:37:14,858
we still can't forge

952
00:37:14,858 --> 00:37:16,217
ten Bloodshed Weapons.

953
00:37:16,418 --> 00:37:17,577
I have an idea.

954
00:37:17,697 --> 00:37:19,217
That might help us complete the task.

955
00:37:19,418 --> 00:37:20,458
What is it?

956
00:37:20,458 --> 00:37:22,338
During the forging of Bloodshed Weapons,

957
00:37:22,338 --> 00:37:24,938
a large number
of Blood Spirit Stones are needed

958
00:37:25,018 --> 00:37:25,978
to enhance

959
00:37:25,978 --> 00:37:27,577
their penetration and lethality.

960
00:37:27,777 --> 00:37:28,498
But

961
00:37:28,617 --> 00:37:31,058
there's only one Blood Spirit Stone,

962
00:37:31,177 --> 00:37:32,898
which increases
the difficulty of forging

963
00:37:32,898 --> 00:37:34,458
and extends the time cost.

964
00:37:34,538 --> 00:37:36,177
So what do you suggest?

965
00:37:36,538 --> 00:37:38,617
It's said that the Ancient Bloodline

966
00:37:38,617 --> 00:37:39,737
has strong spiritual power.

967
00:37:40,018 --> 00:37:41,858
With it,

968
00:37:41,858 --> 00:37:42,617
perhaps

969
00:37:42,617 --> 00:37:44,378
the same effect can be achieved,

970
00:37:44,938 --> 00:37:47,858
and the Bloodshed Weapons can be forged.

971
00:37:48,777 --> 00:37:50,737
Ancient Bloodline?

972
00:38:10,177 --> 00:38:11,217
Moyang Chen,

973
00:38:12,137 --> 00:38:13,737
what tricks are you playing now?

974
00:38:14,777 --> 00:38:15,697
Sister,

975
00:38:16,297 --> 00:38:18,058
I need your help.

976
00:38:21,018 --> 00:38:22,338
This is also

977
00:38:22,577 --> 00:38:24,938
for the benefit of our family.

978
00:38:30,297 --> 00:38:31,498
I won't help you.

979
00:38:32,858 --> 00:38:35,338
Then you have no choice.

980
00:38:39,458 --> 00:38:40,538
What are you doing?

981
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,818
Moyang Chen.

982
00:39:09,097 --> 00:39:09,978
With it, can you

983
00:39:09,978 --> 00:39:11,177
forge ten Bloodshed Weapons

984
00:39:11,177 --> 00:39:12,978
within ten days?

985
00:39:12,978 --> 00:39:13,858
I'm afraid not.

986
00:39:13,858 --> 00:39:15,297
The forging of Bloodshed Weapons
requires a large number

987
00:39:15,297 --> 00:39:16,137
of Blood Spirit Stones.

988
00:39:16,217 --> 00:39:18,018
Although the Ancient Bloodline

989
00:39:18,018 --> 00:39:19,378
has great Internal Energy,

990
00:39:19,378 --> 00:39:20,777
a single drop is not enough.

991
00:39:21,858 --> 00:39:24,657
Then add more Ancient Blood to it.

992
00:39:24,858 --> 00:39:26,018
Bring a bloodletting device.

993
00:39:26,777 --> 00:39:27,577
Moyang Chen,

994
00:39:27,697 --> 00:39:29,177
you know

995
00:39:29,177 --> 00:39:29,777
how powerful

996
00:39:29,818 --> 00:39:30,818
Bloodshed Weapons are.

997
00:39:31,058 --> 00:39:31,818
You side with the Demon Clan,

998
00:39:31,818 --> 00:39:33,297
and there will be no good end.

999
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:34,217
Don't forget

1000
00:39:34,217 --> 00:39:35,938
you're a Xia Clan member.

1001
00:39:38,498 --> 00:39:40,297
I just want to be the strongest person.

1002
00:39:40,697 --> 00:39:41,898
I don't care what you say.

1003
00:39:41,978 --> 00:39:42,418
You!

1004
00:39:51,018 --> 00:39:53,137
Unless your Ancient Bloodline

1005
00:39:53,697 --> 00:39:55,498
can unleash

1006
00:39:55,498 --> 00:39:56,737
stronger power,

1007
00:39:57,458 --> 00:39:58,418
you will be

1008
00:39:58,697 --> 00:40:00,657
my match.

1009
00:40:01,577 --> 00:40:02,297
You...

1010
00:40:59,747 --> 00:41:01,976
(Grace Meaning of Archean)

1011
00:41:37,818 --> 00:41:39,177
Moyang Yu,

1012
00:41:40,858 --> 00:41:42,617
you ruined my plan.

1013
00:41:42,858 --> 00:41:44,938
You destroyed my Bloodshed Weapons.

1014
00:41:45,418 --> 00:41:47,097
How am I supposed to face my boss?

1015
00:41:47,617 --> 00:41:48,858
You're hopeless.

1016
00:41:52,737 --> 00:41:55,418
I might actually smash your every bone.

1017
00:41:59,137 --> 00:42:00,617
Don't forget

1018
00:42:02,018 --> 00:42:04,137
you still have two sons.

1019
00:42:05,137 --> 00:42:06,058
Don't you want

1020
00:42:06,058 --> 00:42:07,297
to see them again?

1021
00:42:08,338 --> 00:42:10,458
If you touch them,

1022
00:42:11,697 --> 00:42:13,978
we'll both die.

1023
00:42:15,177 --> 00:42:17,818
Why do you have to do this to me?

1024
00:42:17,978 --> 00:42:18,737
I just want

1025
00:42:18,737 --> 00:42:20,058
to become Transcendent,

1026
00:42:20,058 --> 00:42:22,018
become the strongest one in the world.

1027
00:42:22,018 --> 00:42:24,177
Won't that be your glory too?

1028
00:42:24,938 --> 00:42:26,297
Even if you stop at nothing

1029
00:42:26,657 --> 00:42:28,018
to become a Transcendent Knight,

1030
00:42:28,617 --> 00:42:30,657
you'll be just a waste of power

1031
00:42:30,657 --> 00:42:32,458
with no idea of right and wrong!

1032
00:42:35,058 --> 00:42:35,858
You...

1033
00:42:40,058 --> 00:42:41,097
You...

1034
00:42:42,978 --> 00:42:45,617
None of you can understand me,

1035
00:42:47,058 --> 00:42:48,777
not even you.

1036
00:42:53,498 --> 00:42:54,418
What?

1037
00:42:54,898 --> 00:42:55,858
Destroyed?

1038
00:42:56,058 --> 00:42:57,297
I'm incompetent.

1039
00:42:58,257 --> 00:42:58,938
Please

1040
00:42:59,378 --> 00:43:00,978
punish me, Second Priest.

1041
00:43:00,978 --> 00:43:02,657
I've always treated you well.

1042
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:04,378
Now you messed up

1043
00:43:04,378 --> 00:43:05,378
such an important matter.

1044
00:43:05,378 --> 00:43:06,498
Tell me.

1045
00:43:06,858 --> 00:43:08,217
What kind of punishment do you want?

1046
00:43:08,297 --> 00:43:09,697
Second Priest, please calm down.

1047
00:43:10,538 --> 00:43:11,418
Actually,

1048
00:43:11,418 --> 00:43:13,058
there are other ways.

1049
00:43:14,257 --> 00:43:15,217
