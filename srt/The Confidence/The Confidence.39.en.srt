=Episode 39=

3
00:01:47,380 --> 00:01:48,300
Enter.

4
00:02:24,700 --> 00:02:27,700
(Don't be careless, wait for the rescue team.)

5
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:53,100
Does Miss Ke have any orders?

6
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:54,860
When I

7
00:02:54,860 --> 00:02:55,740
can you meet Feng Xiaosheng?

8
00:02:57,660 --> 00:02:58,900
Mr. Feng has been very busy recently.

9
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,260
What are busy with?

10
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,500
Can't tell you.

11
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:05,780
tell him,

12
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:07,260
I want to meet him.

13
00:03:08,540 --> 00:03:09,340
I'll tell you.

14
00:03:44,020 --> 00:03:45,420
Sit down.

15
00:03:45,980 --> 00:03:46,460
Sit down quickly.

16
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,000
(KAVI)

17
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,020
How?

18
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:42,220
In my opinion, Dan Yue still

19
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,820
still didn't want to let go of Feng Ruichi.

20
00:04:56,340 --> 00:04:57,180
Move on, it's okay.

21
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:00,740
What does that really mean?

22
00:05:03,500 --> 00:05:04,260
Greedy.

23
00:05:05,980 --> 00:05:06,380
Want money

24
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,420
so it's his alone.

25
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:13,460
Just tell me, what should I do?

26
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:15,220
I will listen to you.

27
00:05:22,940 --> 00:05:24,020
There will always be a way.

28
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:42,940
Young Master Chi?

29
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,980
The boss here is Dan Yue.

30
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,460
Wait for me here.

31
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:58,300
You play alone first.

32
00:07:35,670 --> 00:07:36,350
It's finished?

33
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,270
Let's go.

34
00:07:39,550 --> 00:07:40,310
Just leave?

35
00:07:41,950 --> 00:07:42,710
What else do you want?

36
00:07:43,550 --> 00:07:44,110
Don't you have to find a way?

37
00:07:44,110 --> 00:07:45,310
take Young Master Chi away?

38
00:07:49,590 --> 00:07:50,270
No need.

39
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:52,270
There will be people who send it to us.

40
00:07:53,990 --> 00:07:55,710
Say goodbye to your girl friends.

41
00:08:14,990 --> 00:08:15,670
Raymond.

42
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:19,750
I have arrived.

43
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:24,550
Fine, I'll be careful.

44
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,590
I'm looking for Amanda.

45
00:08:42,550 --> 00:08:43,030
Who?

46
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:49,150
Amanda.

47
00:10:00,350 --> 00:10:01,110
Please come in.

48
00:10:03,750 --> 00:10:04,470
Miss Ke,

49
00:10:05,590 --> 00:10:06,510
Mr. Feng wants to see you.

50
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,550
Finally want to meet me.

51
00:10:10,470 --> 00:10:11,390
I'm waiting outside.

52
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:12,470
Wait.

53
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:33,150
Miss Ke, you...

54
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,950
Do you know Shen Shijie?

55
00:10:41,870 --> 00:10:42,870
Ever heard.

56
00:10:45,630 --> 00:10:46,470
Do you know,

57
00:10:47,950 --> 00:10:49,150
why did your brother die?

58
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,110
Know.

59
00:10:51,990 --> 00:10:53,150
To save Lord Feng.

60
00:10:55,550 --> 00:10:56,550
That means you know...

61
00:10:58,390 --> 00:10:59,270
That Mr. Feng

62
00:10:59,270 --> 00:11:00,790
not the real Mr. Feng.

63
00:11:01,150 --> 00:11:02,630
But it was Shen Shijie in disguise.

64
00:11:03,710 --> 00:11:04,390
They need it

65
00:11:04,390 --> 00:11:05,390
scapegoat for Shen Shijie,

66
00:11:05,390 --> 00:11:06,790
and your brother is the scapegoat.

67
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,150
Your sister is innocent.

68
00:11:08,670 --> 00:11:10,230
Dia dicelakai oleh Shen Shijie.

69
00:11:10,230 --> 00:11:11,030
Did you know?

70
00:11:12,590 --> 00:11:12,950
Miss Ke,

71
00:11:12,950 --> 00:11:14,390
I don't know what you're talking about.

72
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:17,910
Your heart is very clear.

73
00:11:20,590 --> 00:11:21,030
In my heart,

74
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:22,030
he is Master Feng.

75
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:24,030
Gang, don't be stupid.

76
00:11:24,030 --> 00:11:26,470
Now you are now serving the person who killed your brother.

77
00:11:26,470 --> 00:11:27,270
Miss Ke.

78
00:11:30,950 --> 00:11:31,630
Mr. Feng

79
00:11:31,630 --> 00:11:32,950
will be angry if you wait too long.

80
00:11:47,350 --> 00:11:48,830
I know you're a good person.

81
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:51,470
What you just said

82
00:11:51,470 --> 00:11:52,790
I won't tell Mr. Feng.

83
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:55,390
Stay cool.

84
00:12:28,270 --> 00:12:29,310
The wedding dress I chose for you,

85
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,270
do you like it?

86
00:12:30,390 --> 00:12:31,350
Don't like it.

87
00:12:31,790 --> 00:12:32,830
If so, too bad.

88
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:35,070
You don't have a choice.

89
00:12:40,430 --> 00:12:41,710
Actually, what do you want to do?

90
00:12:42,590 --> 00:12:43,510
Don't tell me,

91
00:12:43,510 --> 00:12:44,430
you kidnapped me here

92
00:12:45,710 --> 00:12:46,630
just to force it

93
00:12:46,630 --> 00:12:47,670
people who don't like you at all,

94
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:48,910
even want to send you

95
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:49,910
into prison

96
00:12:49,910 --> 00:12:50,550
to marry you.

97
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,030
You are my fiancé.

98
00:13:07,230 --> 00:13:07,990
I just run

99
00:13:07,990 --> 00:13:08,750
a real wedding

100
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:09,830
I should have done it.

101
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:10,990
You did all this

102
00:13:10,990 --> 00:13:12,470
absolutely meaningless.

103
00:13:12,470 --> 00:13:13,310
Is it true?

104
00:13:24,950 --> 00:13:26,470
I've even picked out her wedding ring.

105
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:28,070
You know what the answer is.

106
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:32,870
I guess, when you see me again,

107
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,830
At least you'll feel a little guilty.

108
00:13:35,230 --> 00:13:35,950
Feel guilty?

109
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:39,350
Why should I feel guilty?

110
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,590
There never was

111
00:13:45,390 --> 00:13:47,030
who could play me like this.

112
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:52,510
Congratulations, yes, Ke Ying,

113
00:13:53,510 --> 00:13:54,590
you did it.

114
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:57,310
Thank you for the compliment.

115
00:13:59,270 --> 00:14:00,150
What did you say?

116
00:14:00,230 --> 00:14:01,350
Thank you for the compliment.

117
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:34,110
Come and kiss me now...

118
00:14:37,870 --> 00:14:38,950
then I will forgive you.

119
00:14:40,510 --> 00:14:41,150
I can assume

120
00:14:41,150 --> 00:14:41,870
all things in the past

121
00:14:41,870 --> 00:14:43,150
never happened.

122
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:49,990
I want you to come here and kiss me!

123
00:15:25,270 --> 00:15:26,030
Close your eyes.

124
00:15:49,030 --> 00:15:50,470
You've been lying to me all this time.

125
00:15:51,670 --> 00:15:53,150
Everything you've ever done,

126
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:55,070
everything you've ever said,

127
00:15:55,070 --> 00:15:56,470
it's all just lies, isn't it?

128
00:15:57,390 --> 00:15:58,070
Correct.

129
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:00,350
You never liked me,

130
00:16:00,350 --> 00:16:01,150
true, right?

131
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,150
Correct.

132
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:03,350
Why?

133
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:05,070
Say! Why?

134
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,070
To survive,

135
00:16:08,230 --> 00:16:09,230
for revenge!

136
00:16:09,550 --> 00:16:10,990
The gun is already pressed against your forehead,

137
00:16:11,590 --> 00:16:12,350
why can't you

138
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,670
continue your lies?

139
00:16:15,830 --> 00:16:16,830
I am tired!

140
00:16:17,190 --> 00:16:18,470
I don't want to lie anymore!

141
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,190
I really want to shoot you to death.

142
00:16:24,750 --> 00:16:25,790
Just shoot.

143
00:16:27,910 --> 00:16:28,870
Kill me.

144
00:16:57,950 --> 00:16:58,830
If I want to kill you,

145
00:16:58,830 --> 00:17:00,030
I've killed you from the start.

146
00:17:00,030 --> 00:17:01,070
Still waiting until now?

147
00:17:17,110 --> 00:17:18,430
Can lie for that long,

148
00:17:19,110 --> 00:17:20,630
that's also a kind of love, isn't it?

149
00:17:21,230 --> 00:17:22,390
Shen Shijie,

150
00:17:23,870 --> 00:17:25,500
do you understand what love is?

151
00:17:26,110 --> 00:17:27,590
I don't understand, but I can learn.

152
00:17:28,300 --> 00:17:29,310
You can teach me.

153
00:17:29,310 --> 00:17:30,670
I can definitely learn it.

154
00:17:32,470 --> 00:17:33,310
Didn't you say you like it

155
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,430
island in Panama?

156
00:17:35,950 --> 00:17:37,270
After I get the money in two days,

157
00:17:37,550 --> 00:17:38,910
we go buy the island.

158
00:17:39,950 --> 00:17:41,190
If all goes well,

159
00:17:42,590 --> 00:17:43,110
We can

160
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:44,190
get there before new year.

161
00:17:45,710 --> 00:17:46,430
Ying,

162
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:49,750
Our first year is coming up soon.

163
00:17:53,510 --> 00:17:54,670
Be aware!

164
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,910
I can't possibly buy it with you...

165
00:18:02,710 --> 00:18:03,630
I'm telling you,

166
00:18:04,550 --> 00:18:05,670
stop dreaming!

167
00:18:07,870 --> 00:18:08,630
You won't have such a thing

168
00:18:08,630 --> 00:18:09,590
first year.

169
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:11,830
You won't be able to escape anymore!

170
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:13,590
The one waiting for you

171
00:18:14,670 --> 00:18:15,990
just despair,

172
00:18:15,990 --> 00:18:17,230
and death!

173
00:18:19,270 --> 00:18:20,750
I told you earlier,

174
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:23,750
I never liked you.

175
00:18:23,750 --> 00:18:25,070
Never.

176
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,030
From start to finish,

177
00:18:27,830 --> 00:18:28,830
towards you,

178
00:18:30,670 --> 00:18:32,150
there is only fear,

179
00:18:32,550 --> 00:18:33,430
disgust,

180
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,510
and hate!

181
00:18:59,230 --> 00:19:00,310
If I never do

182
00:19:00,310 --> 00:19:01,510
things that hurt you,

183
00:19:05,670 --> 00:19:06,510
maybe you

184
00:19:06,830 --> 00:19:08,390
will like me, won't you?

185
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:17,830
Won't.

186
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:24,990
Because you're an asshole.

187
00:19:30,430 --> 00:19:31,190
Correct.

188
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,790
I'm a bastard.

189
00:19:45,710 --> 00:19:46,790
However, I'm not a bastard

190
00:19:46,790 --> 00:19:47,590
since birth.

191
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:58,750
In this world,

192
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,430
many people are less fortunate than you,

193
00:20:02,710 --> 00:20:03,710
experience more suffering

194
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:05,430
and disaster from you.

195
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:06,830
However, even so,

196
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:08,070
they still don't vote

197
00:20:08,070 --> 00:20:10,190
abandon their integrity and conscience!

198
00:20:10,670 --> 00:20:11,590
They won't be like you,

199
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:12,950
do bad things!

200
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:14,910
Won't be like you,

201
00:20:14,910 --> 00:20:16,030
become a criminal

202
00:20:16,190 --> 00:20:17,390
that kills and burns!

203
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:21,190
No matter what,

204
00:20:21,470 --> 00:20:22,470
no matter what you say...

205
00:20:22,590 --> 00:20:23,590
because you are helpless,

206
00:20:24,310 --> 00:20:26,070
or forced to do so,

207
00:20:26,230 --> 00:20:26,830
it's just an excuse

208
00:20:26,830 --> 00:20:28,070
that you gave yourself

209
00:20:28,390 --> 00:20:30,070
after making a choice.

210
00:20:31,430 --> 00:20:32,550
Whenever that is,

211
00:20:32,750 --> 00:20:35,030
no reason can set you free

212
00:20:35,310 --> 00:20:37,270
from the bad things you've done.

213

217
00:21:18,270 --> 00:21:19,510
Their position is here,

218
00:21:19,670 --> 00:21:21,310
an island that is only half developed.

219
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,590
The western and southern sides of the island

220
00:21:23,590 --> 00:21:24,830
is primary forest.

221
00:21:25,790 --> 00:21:27,710
If we want to go to the island secretly,

222
00:21:28,030 --> 00:21:29,270
can only choose this path.

223
00:21:29,670 --> 00:21:31,070
From here to the island,

224
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:32,830
through this thick forest area,

225
00:21:32,830 --> 00:21:34,790
and arrived at the beach hotel on the north side.

226
00:21:35,710 --> 00:21:37,310
According to the information we got,

227
00:21:37,670 --> 00:21:39,550
in the hotel there are eleven mercenaries

228
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,710
and six guards.

229
00:21:41,030 --> 00:21:41,750
Furthermore,

230
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:43,230
it's better if we discuss it first

231
00:21:43,230 --> 00:21:44,590
action plan after landing.

232
00:21:45,550 --> 00:21:46,310
Good.

233
00:21:59,750 --> 00:22:00,990
I didn't know that.

234
00:22:02,510 --> 00:22:04,390
What is certain is that previously they loved and hurt each other.

235
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:05,950
Now I'm starting to wake up

236
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:07,430
want to get married and so on.

237
00:22:08,470 --> 00:22:10,070
Women are really troublesome.

238
00:22:16,070 --> 00:22:16,830
Mr. Feng.

239
00:22:19,550 --> 00:22:20,270
What is it?

240
00:22:26,390 --> 00:22:27,430
What is it? Just say it.

241
00:22:31,190 --> 00:22:32,670
This watch was left to me by my brother.

242
00:22:32,950 --> 00:22:34,310
You are already going to marry Miss Ke,

243
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:37,310
I gift this to you.

244
00:22:45,070 --> 00:22:46,190
Silly boy.

245
00:22:46,430 --> 00:22:47,790
You can't just give gifts.

246
00:22:56,830 --> 00:22:57,870
Go see Miss Ke.

247
00:23:01,710 --> 00:23:02,950
If you have time, use sunscreen.

248
00:23:03,670 --> 00:23:05,350
It's just like a crab.

249
00:23:17,670 --> 00:23:18,350
Kak Jie.

250
00:23:26,590 --> 00:23:27,310
Chatting about what?

251
00:23:31,830 --> 00:23:32,510
We're chatting

252
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:33,350
why should you bother

253
00:23:33,350 --> 00:23:34,350
holding this wedding ceremony?

254
00:23:37,550 --> 00:23:38,670
If you don't have a wedding,

255
00:23:39,350 --> 00:23:40,710
how to invite Young Master Chi?

256
00:23:43,310 --> 00:23:44,230
I understand.

257
00:23:46,230 --> 00:23:47,430
Finally got smarter.

258
00:23:48,870 --> 00:23:49,910
Sis, don't joke.

259
00:23:51,190 --> 00:23:52,790
However, now the key to the problem is...

260
00:23:54,990 --> 00:23:55,340
he was afraid that Dan Yue was not ready to let him go.

261
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,390
he was afraid that Dan Yue was not ready to let him go.

262
00:23:56,550 --> 00:23:57,510
Don't worry.

263
00:23:58,350 --> 00:23:59,710
And Yue is a wise person.

264
00:24:00,470 --> 00:24:02,110
He doesn't dare to do anything to me at the moment.

265
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,670
He was afraid I would destroy the documents

266
00:24:03,670 --> 00:24:04,670
and the key in my hand.

267
00:24:05,150 --> 00:24:06,270
If so, the Feng family's assets

268
00:24:06,270 --> 00:24:07,150
will be completely submerged.

269
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:08,110
No one can get it.

270
00:24:11,430 --> 00:24:13,230
Because he used Young Master Chi as bait,

271
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:15,390
of course he had to appear in front of me,

272
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:16,950
so I can bite the bait.

273
00:24:19,430 --> 00:24:20,150
Kak Kun,

274
00:24:20,670 --> 00:24:22,030
do you understand?

275
00:24:22,670 --> 00:24:24,110
I don't need to understand.

276
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:25,910
I just need to listen

277
00:24:25,910 --> 00:24:26,830
Just Jie's instructions.

278
00:24:27,150 --> 00:24:28,150
I'm the same way, yeah.

279
00:24:29,070 --> 00:24:29,950
I'm the same as Brother Kun.

280
00:24:30,190 --> 00:24:31,030
Everything

281
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,270
listen to Sis Jie's orders.

282
00:24:37,110 --> 00:24:37,950
However,

283
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:39,750
is Young Master Chi

284
00:24:40,990 --> 00:24:42,510
will you listen obediently?

285
00:24:45,670 --> 00:24:46,870
He had no choice.

286
00:25:23,670 --> 00:25:24,270
Remember,

287
00:25:25,910 --> 00:25:26,910
saddened by an accident,

288
00:25:26,910 --> 00:25:28,150
no meaning.

289
00:25:29,310 --> 00:25:30,950
You should be like your brother,

290
00:25:34,030 --> 00:25:35,430
learn to accept life

291
00:25:36,310 --> 00:25:37,350
and enjoy life.

292
00:25:38,190 --> 00:25:39,350
Mr. Dan Yue is right.

293
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:44,710
Tomorrow morning,

294
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:46,990
I will go to the wedding with you.

295
00:25:47,950 --> 00:25:48,670
Calm down.

296
00:25:49,630 --> 00:25:51,350
I will guarantee your safety.

297
00:25:53,030 --> 00:25:53,750
Here,

298
00:25:53,750 --> 00:25:54,830
no one dared

299
00:25:54,830 --> 00:25:55,870
disrespectful to my guests.

300
00:25:56,390 --> 00:25:57,750
In that case, I am very grateful to Mr. Dan Yue.

301
00:25:58,190 --> 00:25:59,350
No need to hesitate.

302
00:26:02,390 --> 00:26:03,070
Good luck.

303
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,110
Young Master Chi.

304
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:25,910
Do you think, Dan Yue

305
00:26:26,430 --> 00:26:27,750
will allow us to meet Mr. Feng?

306
00:26:30,790 --> 00:26:31,470
I don't have any anymore

307
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:32,550
value again.

308
00:26:32,830 --> 00:26:34,670
He definitely needed to change targets.

309
00:26:36,710 --> 00:26:37,710
Wedding?

310
00:26:39,150 --> 00:26:40,110
Wedding.

311
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:41,710
Not fast and not slow.

312
00:26:42,430 --> 00:26:44,470
The timing really was perfect.

313
00:26:46,030 --> 00:26:46,590
Come on in.

314
00:26:46,590 --> 00:26:46,990
Good.

315
00:27:06,470 --> 00:27:07,310
Enjoy.

316
00:27:08,950 --> 00:27:09,950
Friends,

317
00:27:11,070 --> 00:27:12,430
come on, cheers!

318
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:14,190
Cheers!

319
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:26,830
they,

320
00:27:27,070 --> 00:27:27,870
telephone.

321
00:27:36,190 --> 00:27:36,910
Halo.

322
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:44,710
Good.

323
00:27:53,630 --> 00:27:54,430
It's set.

324
00:27:55,950 --> 00:27:57,470
And Yue will send people off tomorrow.

325
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:01,150
Then, I will prepare immediately.

326
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:02,110
Be well prepared.

327
00:28:02,710 --> 00:28:03,550
After it finishes,

328
00:28:05,230 --> 00:28:06,310
let's go straight from here.

329
00:28:09,710 --> 00:28:10,390
they,

330
00:28:13,110 --> 00:28:14,750
"Forced fruit is not sweet."

331
00:28:36,590 --> 00:28:38,430
Why still can't call out?

332
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:53,950
Kak Kun!

333
00:29:00,030 --> 00:29:00,830
Kak Kun.

334
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:02,710
What are you doing?

335
00:29:03,550 --> 00:29:04,950
The sky is clear, the sun is shining.

336
00:29:06,110 --> 00:29:06,870
Sunbathe.

337
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:15,470
Kak Kun.

338
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,310
What do you guys want to do?

339
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:20,310
To the sea, there is business.

340
00:29:20,830 --> 00:29:22,350
To the sea, huh?

341
00:29:23,350 --> 00:29:24,230
Every day here,

342
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:25,310
I'm so bored.

343
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:26,750
One time, Brother Sheng asked me to play outside.

344
00:29:26,750 --> 00:29:27,710
It's really nice outside.

345
00:29:27,750 --> 00:29:28,990
Delicious food and drinks, everything is there.

346
00:29:28,990 --> 00:29:30,270
Sis, invite me.

347
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:31,750
I went to...

348
00:29:33,670 --> 00:29:34,510
You stay on the island

349
00:29:34,510 --> 00:29:35,590
fine.

350
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:37,030
Don't add problems for me.

351
00:29:39,950 --> 00:29:41,030
No, you really didn't invite me,

352
00:29:41,030 --> 00:29:41,590
Kak Kun?

353
00:29:59,470 --> 00:30:00,070
there,

354
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:02,470
on that island.

355
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:05,430
The hotel belongs to Mr. Dan Yue.

356
00:30:07,910 --> 00:30:10,430
Recently, several Chinese people lived there.

357
00:30:10,430 --> 00:30:11,270
The person you are looking for

358
00:30:11,270 --> 00:30:12,270
it should be there.

359
00:30:15,310 --> 00:30:17,270
I'll help you get there.

360
00:30:18,310 --> 00:30:19,390
Get a boat,

361
00:30:19,390 --> 00:30:21,590
and take you to the island secretly when it's dark.

362
00:31:07,230 --> 00:31:08,190
Nice, no?

363
00:31:11,430 --> 00:31:12,350
Is it reliable?

364
00:31:13,710 --> 00:31:14,550
Of course.

365
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:18,070
I made it especially for you.

366
00:31:24,430 --> 00:31:25,590
How strong is his strength?

367
00:31:29,710 --> 00:31:30,950
No matter what happens,

368
00:31:31,950 --> 00:31:33,270
don't be too far from me.

369
00:31:39,150 --> 00:31:40,990
If it is more than two hundred meters,

370
00:31:42,070 --> 00:31:43,670
or the belt broke,

371
00:31:45,150 --> 00:31:46,550
it will explode automatically.

372
00:32:08,230 --> 00:32:09,430
From now on,

373
00:32:11,390 --> 00:32:12,270
your fate

374
00:32:13,110 --> 00:32:14,070
closely related

375
00:32:14,070 --> 00:32:15,030
with me.

376
00:32:20,870 --> 00:32:21,910
You see, right?

377
00:32:22,870 --> 00:32:23,990
This is my heartbeat.

378
00:32:25,070 --> 00:32:26,550
If my heart stops,

379
00:32:29,470 --> 00:32:30,590
it will also explode.

380
00:32:39,350 --> 00:32:40,110
If so, you should

381
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:41,070
Take care of yourself.

382
00:32:42,390 --> 00:32:44,470
Don't die from a stray bullet.

383
00:32:45,430 --> 00:32:47,270
I don't want to die with you.

384
00:32:50,670 --> 00:32:51,430
Stay cool.

385
00:32:53,390 --> 00:32:54,910
I still want to buy you an island.

386
00:32:56,270 --> 00:32:57,630
After it's all over,

387
00:32:59,510 --> 00:33:01,630
I will give you the life you want.

388
00:33:28,590 --> 00:33:29,790
The life I want?

389
00:33:32,630 --> 00:33:34,070
What kind of life do I want?

390
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:52,790
What kind of life did I give you,

391
00:33:54,670 --> 00:33:56,270
that's the life you want.

392
00:34:03,510 --> 00:34:04,550
I thank you.

393
00:34:35,420 --> 00:34:36,900
We have to protect these two people.

394
00:34:37,590 --> 00:34:38,820
Don't worry.

395
00:34:39,030 --> 00:34:40,270
This is for you.

396
00:34:41,110 --> 00:34:41,990
For you.

397
00:34:42,820 --> 00:34:44,070
This is for you.

398
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,150
Halo.

399
00:34:59,910 --> 00:35:00,870
Fine, I know.

400
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:08,710
And Yue was also on the island.

401
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:10,590
There were so many people around.

402
00:35:10,990 --> 00:35:11,950
Therefore,

403
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:13,670
catching becomes more difficult.

404
00:35:14,110 --> 00:35:14,870
We must

405
00:35:14,870 --> 00:35:17,150
waiting for the support troops to arrive,

406
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:18,110
just act.

407
00:35:18,110 --> 00:35:19,470
How long will it take to wait for support troops?

408
00:35:20,430 --> 00:35:21,550
It's hard to be sure.

409
00:35:22,590 --> 00:35:23,590
However, don't worry.

410
00:35:23,590 --> 00:35:25,110
It should be arriving soon.

411
00:36:30,150 --> 00:36:31,150
Good.

412
00:36:33,910 --> 00:36:34,630
Good.

413
00:36:34,630 --> 00:36:35,550
welcome

414
00:36:38,590 --> 00:36:39,230
Tell him later...

415
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:43,150
Very cool.

416
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:51,670
I like.

417
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:01,470
This old man is good at shooting.

418
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:02,790
Later let him show off a little.

419
00:37:11,390 --> 00:37:12,270
Want to try?

420
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:57,830
With the arrival of Dan Yue,

421
00:37:58,590 --> 00:38:00,350
afraid that the situation would become even more chaotic.

422
00:38:03,510 --> 00:38:04,510
You get ready.

423
00:38:06,990 --> 00:38:07,870
Sebelum Shen Shijie

424
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:09,310
act against Dan Yue...

425
00:38:13,390 --> 00:38:14,910
I have prepared clothes for you,

426
00:38:15,670 --> 00:38:16,950
I will take you out first.

427
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:18,950
As long as you can ride a boat,

428
00:38:19,350 --> 00:38:20,430
everything will be easier.

429
00:38:27,150 --> 00:38:28,830
You followed Shen Shijie all the way,

430
00:38:29,350 --> 00:38:30,470
what is your real goal?

431
00:38:31,150 --> 00:38:32,510
Not just to save me, right?

432
00:38:34,990 --> 00:38:35,470
I don't know

433
00:38:35,470 --> 00:38:36,670
you are held here by them.

434
00:38:37,790 --> 00:38:38,910
You're here to catch Shen Shijie,

435
00:38:38,910 --> 00:38:39,430
true, right?

436
00:38:41,390 --> 00:38:42,470
Get him back

437
00:38:43,030 --> 00:38:44,550
to receive legal sanctions,

438
00:38:45,150 --> 00:38:46,310
for Officer Chen's sake,

439
00:38:47,310 --> 00:38:48,950
for the sake of those he killed,

440
00:38:49,870 --> 00:38:51,270
claim the truth for them,

441
00:38:51,870 --> 00:38:52,990
ask for justice.

442
00:38:54,390 --> 00:38:56,070
Also for my own conscience.

443
00:38:57,990 --> 00:38:59,110
What you have to do now

444
00:39:00,870 --> 00:39:02,430
was to save Feng Ruichi first.

445
00:39:04,070 --> 00:39:05,510
Weren't you asked to monitor him?

446
00:39:05,830 --> 00:39:06,990
This is a great opportunity.

447
00:39:07,270 --> 00:39:08,430
Look for opportunities to save him.

448
00:39:09,150 --> 00:39:10,110
Why?

449
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,630
Because without Feng Ruichi,

450
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:14,590
documents and keys in his hand

451
00:39:14,870 --> 00:39:16,150
not useful at all.

452
00:39:16,150 --> 00:39:17,950
As long as he can't get the Feng Group's money,

453
00:39:18,670 --> 00:39:19,830
he wouldn't be able to do anything.

454
00:39:21,390 --> 00:39:22,950
Sooner or later the police will catch him.

455
00:39:23,590 --> 00:39:24,350
Good.

456
00:39:25,630 --> 00:39:26,350
Just calm down.

457
00:39:26,510 --> 00:39:27,150
I understand.

458
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:33,630
Do not touch.

459
00:39:34,310 --> 00:39:35,270
How about this?

460
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:38,910
Stay cool.

461
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:39,910
I can save myself.

462
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:40,990
This...

463
00:39:42,110 --> 00:39:43,670
Leave Shen Shijie to me.

464
00:39:50,830 --> 00:39:51,670
Now,

465
00:39:52,150 --> 00:39:53,670
we can be considered comrades in arms, right?

466
00:39:55,070 --> 00:39:56,110
If so, hopefully we are

467
00:39:57,110 --> 00:39:58,670
complete each task smoothly.

468
00:40:17,150 --> 00:40:18,070
Here,

469
00:40:18,310 --> 00:40:19,150
no one can

470
00:40:19,310 --> 00:40:21,310
hurt Mr. Dan Yue's guests.

471
00:40:45,270 --> 00:40:46,110
Chief of police

472
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:46,670
already sent someone

473
00:40:46,670 --> 00:40:47,950
looking for Mr. Dan Yue.

474
00:40:48,150 --> 00:40:49,470
Ask some

475
00:40:49,470 --> 00:40:50,950
information about Mr. Feng

476
00:40:51,670 --> 00:40:52,390
to Mr. Dan Yue.

477
00:40:52,390 --> 00:40:53,790
However, Master Dan Yue told them,

478
00:40:53,990 --> 00:40:54,830
they are good friends,

479
00:40:54,830 --> 00:40:56,550
will not betray him to anyone.

480
00:41:09,990 --> 00:41:10,950
Like Young Master Chi.

481
00:41:11,310 --> 00:41:12,870
Master Dan Yue once said to Young Master Chi,

482
00:41:13,270 --> 00:41:14,030
he can stay

483
00:41:14,030 --> 00:41:15,150
in place quietly.

484
00:41:15,150 --> 00:41:16,310
Nothing can hurt him.

485
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:25,150
Thank you very much, Mr. Dan Yue.

486
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:26,350
After the Feng family

487
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,590
experiencing something like this,

488
00:41:27,590 --> 00:41:28,510
still provides protection

489
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:29,550
to both of us.

490
00:41:30,150 --> 00:41:30,910
I will definitely look for opportunities

491
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:33,390
to repay the favor well.

492
00:41:43,830 --> 00:41:44,630
Cheers.

493
00:41:57,150 --> 00:41:59,150
Master Dan Yue wanted to know

494
00:41:59,390 --> 00:42:00,870
what are your next plans?

495
00:42:03,310 --> 00:42:04,150
Kak Sheng.

496
00:42:10,670 --> 00:42:11,590
Friend.

497
00:42:12,950 --> 00:42:13,830
Hello, Young Master Chi.

498
00:42:18,150 --> 00:42:19,790
From the start I knew you had the ability.

499
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:21,350
Look, I'm right, right?

500
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:22,590
Young Master Chi,

501
00:42:22,670 --> 00:42:23,830
You're making fun of me again?

502
00:42:24,150 --> 00:42:25,150
I'm serious.

503
00:42:25,390 --> 00:42:26,270
Wu.

504
00:42:27,030 --> 00:42:27,990
You came just on time.

505
00:42:29,030 --> 00:42:30,070
I saw Young Master Chi

506
00:42:30,070 --> 00:42:31,030
tired of being here.

507
00:42:31,150 --> 00:42:32,150
You accompany him

508
00:42:32,390 --> 00:42:33,430
walk down.

509
00:42:34,070 --> 00:42:34,830
Good.

510
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:36,910
See, he really understands me the most,

511
00:42:36,910 --> 00:42:37,790
I've had enough since then.

512
00:42:37,790 --> 00:42:38,910
Come on, come on, come on.

513
00:43:07,310 --> 00:43:08,150
Wu.

514
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:10,950
Be good friends.

515
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,070
