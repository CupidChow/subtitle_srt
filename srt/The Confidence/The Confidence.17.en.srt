00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 17=

3
00:01:53,060 --> 00:01:55,140
Yuze, why are you back?

4
00:01:57,810 --> 00:01:59,340
Ying Ying, what's going on?

5
00:02:00,140 --> 00:02:01,290
What is this news?

6
00:02:01,290 --> 00:02:02,420
a misunderstanding?

7
00:02:17,530 --> 00:02:18,420
Not a misunderstanding.

8
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:26,500
Ke Ying, are you crazy?

9
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:28,650
He is Feng Xiaosheng.

10
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:30,300
You... haven't you always been suspicious

11
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:31,980
that he and Shen Shijie were the same person?

12
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:33,730
Why are you related to him?

13
00:02:38,090 --> 00:02:38,860
Tell me honestly.

14
00:02:38,860 --> 00:02:40,810
Did you approach him because you wanted to prove that

15
00:02:40,810 --> 00:02:42,250
he and Shen Shijie are the same person?

16
00:02:42,580 --> 00:02:43,300
Nope.

17
00:02:45,090 --> 00:02:48,140
Feng Xiaosheng and Shen Shijie had nothing to do with each other at all.

18
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:52,580
Then, what is this for?

19
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:01,300
Face...

20
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:05,580
sorry

21
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:13,940
I can't marry you.

22
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,610
You want to break up with me?

23
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:37,500
I...

24
00:03:37,810 --> 00:03:38,650
we just broke up.

25
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:40,810
I don't love you anymore.

26
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:46,420
Then, who do you love?

27
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:51,060
Ke Ying, look at me.

28
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,170
Ke Ying, look at me.

29
00:03:54,650 --> 00:03:56,140
You can't possibly love Feng Xiaosheng, right?

30
00:03:58,810 --> 00:03:59,610
Do you still remember?

31
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:00,420
That...

32
00:04:00,810 --> 00:04:01,580
dia adalah Shen Shijie.

33
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:03,140
You suspect it's the same person.

34
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,250
He's the devil.

35
00:04:04,250 --> 00:04:05,060
He's a murderous demon.

36
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,090
He's a gangster!

37
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,810
That... that...

38
00:04:12,580 --> 00:04:14,220
that's because I was wrong.

39
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,980
They... they just have similar levels.

40
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:20,300
They are not the same person.

41
00:04:21,700 --> 00:04:22,420
Correct,

42
00:04:23,140 --> 00:04:24,250
I'm indeed suspicious.

43
00:04:25,420 --> 00:04:27,140
So, I looked into it.

44
00:04:27,140 --> 00:04:28,490
In the research process,

45
00:04:29,180 --> 00:04:30,050
I realised...

46
00:04:31,660 --> 00:04:33,370
he is really very good.

47
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:36,180
between us,

48
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,060
there is so much to talk about.

49
00:04:40,810 --> 00:04:42,530
So, at that time...

50
00:04:44,850 --> 00:04:45,900
I'm helpless.

51
00:04:47,250 --> 00:04:47,810
I...

52
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,250
I immediately fell in love with him.

53
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,740
Face...

54
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,740
sorry

55
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:38,620
Let it go.

56
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:43,090
Do you still remember?

57
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:45,500
Didn't we already agree at that time?

58
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,460
If one day,

59
00:05:48,850 --> 00:05:49,940
one of us no longer loves,

60
00:05:51,130 --> 00:05:52,340
then will release it sincerely.

61
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:55,690
Don't let yourself

62
00:05:57,290 --> 00:05:58,370
and the other party becomes awkward.

63
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,500
Face?

64
00:08:40,610 --> 00:08:41,250
Halo.

65
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,780
Hello, where are you?

66
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,660
Have you gone to work?

67
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:51,100
Speak.

68
00:08:53,540 --> 00:08:55,220
I'm outside the Feng Group building.

69
00:08:56,250 --> 00:08:57,020
What?

70
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:57,930
You...

71
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,050
Don't act impulsively.

72
00:09:00,050 --> 00:09:00,660
Whatever happens,

73
00:09:00,660 --> 00:09:01,810
Wait until I come and talk about it, okay?

74
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,020
You...

75
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:17,860
Mr. Yang is at my place.

76
00:09:18,460 --> 00:09:20,100
Feng Xiaosheng, you don't do things like that.

77
00:09:32,170 --> 00:09:33,020
Who are you looking for?

78
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:37,100
WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU?

79
00:09:38,420 --> 00:09:39,610
The chairman of the board of directors invites you to come inside.

80
00:09:40,930 --> 00:09:41,810
where is he

81
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:44,780
Inside the office.

82
00:09:53,930 --> 00:09:54,570
Surface.

83
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:55,570
You're okay, right?

84
00:10:08,050 --> 00:10:09,250
Can he leave now?

85
00:10:14,570 --> 00:10:15,370
Ke Ying.

86
00:10:16,420 --> 00:10:17,780
Please see the situation clearly.

87
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,050
Doctor Yang who barged into my office,

88
00:10:21,050 --> 00:10:22,570
attacked me like a mad dog.

89
00:10:23,570 --> 00:10:24,570
So, my bodyguard

90
00:10:24,780 --> 00:10:25,900
hold it.

91
00:10:30,490 --> 00:10:31,980
I'm not the one who wants to hold him back.

92
00:10:36,130 --> 00:10:37,490
He attacked you?

93
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:40,250
He attacks you,

94
00:10:40,250 --> 00:10:41,930
then, why are all the wounds on his body?

95
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:52,420
Isn't it very clear?

96
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,130
Self defense.

97
00:11:25,020 --> 00:11:26,730
I apologize to you on his behalf.

98
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,130
Sorry,

99
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:32,730
Mr. Feng.

100
00:11:35,930 --> 00:11:37,300
Can you let him go now?

101
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,340
The problem between us,

102
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,540
don't drag others along.

103
00:11:47,860 --> 00:11:48,690
Do you feel...

104
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,570
even though I want to let it go,

105
00:11:53,570 --> 00:11:55,250
will he come home with you obediently?

106
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,420
Surface.

107
00:12:24,460 --> 00:12:26,170
Get out of here with me, okay?

108
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,900
Go with me, yeah?

109
00:12:31,900 --> 00:12:32,810
If there's anything,

110
00:12:34,540 --> 00:12:35,930
let's go out and talk slowly.

111
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:40,300
Go with me, yeah?

112
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,130
I'm begging you.

113
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,610
Of?

114
00:12:56,020 --> 00:12:56,660
You let go.

115
00:12:56,660 --> 00:12:57,690
You let go!

116
00:13:09,300 --> 00:13:10,460
Can we go already?

117
00:13:19,980 --> 00:13:20,610
Let go.

118
00:13:46,540 --> 00:13:47,610
Come on... come on, let's go.

119
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,130
We're going home.

120
00:14:01,780 --> 00:14:02,490
Face it!

121
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:04,490
Ke Ying, don't forget.

122
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,730
You are now my fiancé.

123
00:14:07,460 --> 00:14:09,220
You should keep your distance from other men.

124
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,780
If not, don't blame me for not being reluctant to him.

125
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,100
Remember to accompany me tonight.

126
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,420
Fuck!

127
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,780
You bastard, Feng Xiaosheng!

128
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:20,460
I'm telling you,

129
00:14:20,460 --> 00:14:21,570
Ke Ying my fiancé!

130
00:14:21,570 --> 00:14:22,810
He can't possibly love you!

131
00:14:23,540 --> 00:14:24,420
Feng Xiaosheng!

132
00:14:24,570 --> 00:14:25,810
I beg you, don't talk anymore.

133
00:14:28,610 --> 00:14:30,370
It's best not to let him point his finger at me.

134
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:32,300
Don't point.

135
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:33,610
Surface.

136
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:34,780
Surface.

137
00:14:36,460 --> 00:14:37,860
Surface.

138
00:14:39,810 --> 00:14:41,100
Don't look for trouble, okay?

139
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:42,300
I'm so embarrassed now.

140
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:43,100
I am really...

141
00:14:43,100 --> 00:14:44,460
I'm really very embarrassed.

142
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,660
You've left some dignity for me, haven't you?

143
00:14:47,100 --> 00:14:47,930
Let's go.

144
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,660
I'm begging you.

145
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,370
Let's go, shall we?

146
00:14:51,810 --> 00:14:52,540
Of?

147
00:14:52,980 --> 00:14:53,810
Let's go.

148
00:14:53,860 --> 00:14:54,570
Correct.

149
00:15:08,570 --> 00:15:09,810
From now on,

150
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,460
Miss Ke

151
00:15:11,460 --> 00:15:13,170
is just Mrs. Feng.

152
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:14,660
Understand?

153
00:15:17,170 --> 00:15:18,050
Not true.

154
00:15:18,570 --> 00:15:19,690
He has a girlfriend.

155
00:15:24,610 --> 00:15:26,100
So what if you have a boyfriend?

156
00:15:26,690 --> 00:15:27,490
Are you married?

157
00:15:27,490 --> 00:15:28,220
Not yet.

158
00:15:28,220 --> 00:15:29,780
If you're married, you can still get a divorce, right?

159
00:15:30,570 --> 00:15:32,220
Then, why are you so dizzy?

160
00:15:33,370 --> 00:15:34,540
You... you...

161
00:15:34,540 --> 00:15:35,660
are you the father?

162
00:15:36,220 --> 00:15:37,220
Or are you his son?

163
00:15:39,100 --> 00:15:39,860
Brother Wu.

164
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,100
Take care of what needs to be taken care of.

165
00:15:41,100 --> 00:15:42,690
What shouldn't be taken care of, don't just get involved.

166
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,860
Follow it.

167
00:15:44,930 --> 00:15:45,610
You guys just wait.

168
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:48,610
Later if Mr. Feng sees it again, then the problem will be big.

169
00:15:49,780 --> 00:15:50,860
I... Wow...

170
00:15:52,220 --> 00:15:53,170
Wait a minute, yes.

171
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:58,100
Hello, who?

172
00:15:59,100 --> 00:15:59,860
Mr. Feng?

173
00:16:02,930 --> 00:16:03,610
Understand.

174
00:16:04,570 --> 00:16:05,170
Understand.

175
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:09,860
Fine, I understand.

176
00:16:10,730 --> 00:16:11,660
Got it, got it.

177
00:16:12,930 --> 00:16:14,780
This is our daily work.

178
00:16:15,220 --> 00:16:15,860
You just calm down.

179
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,690
You just calm down, you just calm down.

180
00:16:19,780 --> 00:16:20,930
Work cleaner.

181
00:16:37,460 --> 00:16:38,130
Pile.

182
00:16:38,130 --> 00:16:39,130
You're the one driving.

183
00:16:39,130 --> 00:16:39,930
Good.

184
00:16:40,570 --> 00:16:41,660
You quickly contact Bao Zi,

185
00:16:41,660 --> 00:16:42,660
ask him to wait for us at...

186
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,540
Huafeng Road intersection.

187
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,810
Fast.

188
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:46,810
I?

189
00:16:47,020 --> 00:16:47,860
Naik.

190
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:55,570
Just do it later

191
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,170
whatever I say.

192
00:16:56,170 --> 00:16:57,300
Don't ask anything.

193
00:16:57,340 --> 00:16:58,570
The boss witnessed everything.

194
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,340
Actually, what's the problem with going so many people?

195
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:02,300
Don't ask anything.

196
00:17:02,300 --> 00:17:03,050
Naik.

197
00:17:07,300 --> 00:17:07,850
Halo.

198
00:17:07,850 --> 00:17:08,580
Bao Zi.

199
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:10,250
Gather at the intersection of Huafeng Road, hurry.

200
00:17:31,180 --> 00:17:31,850
Ying Ying.

201
00:17:33,820 --> 00:17:34,900
Tell me honestly.

202
00:17:36,660 --> 00:17:38,420
What's really going on between you and Feng Xiaosheng?

203
00:17:39,940 --> 00:17:41,780
- Yuze. - You can't possibly fall in love with him.

204
00:17:42,820 --> 00:17:43,730
I don't believe it.

205
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:45,940
face

206
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:47,370
calm down a little.

207
00:17:56,370 --> 00:17:57,820
He threatened you, didn't he?

208
00:17:59,730 --> 00:18:01,060
Were you threatened by him?

209
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:06,580
Tell me honestly.

210
00:18:07,450 --> 00:18:08,490
Katakan, Ying Ying!

211
00:18:09,090 --> 00:18:09,940
You weren't like this before.

212
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:10,970
Tell me!

213
00:18:11,660 --> 00:18:12,610
Yang Yuze!

214
00:18:13,610 --> 00:18:15,180
Can you be a little irrational?

215
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,780
I really don't love you anymore!

216
00:18:23,180 --> 00:18:24,420
Let's just break up.

217
00:18:26,370 --> 00:18:29,180
You just pretend that there is no me in this world.

218
00:18:30,370 --> 00:18:32,180
How could it not be you?

219
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:35,330
You... you're here.

220
00:18:36,180 --> 00:18:38,060
Since the first day I knew you,

221
00:18:38,660 --> 00:18:40,020
you're already here.

222
00:18:41,180 --> 00:18:42,370
However, I don't love you anymore.

223
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,210
I don't have feelings for you anymore.

224
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:52,250
No matter where I am, it's no use.

225
00:19:00,780 --> 00:19:01,780
Yang Yuze.

226
00:19:04,330 --> 00:19:06,090
Can't you be a little more authoritative?

227
00:19:07,210 --> 00:19:08,420
Can't you stay a little away from me?

228
00:19:08,420 --> 00:19:10,180
so that in the future I will never see you again?

229
00:19:15,450 --> 00:19:16,180
Ying Ying.

230
00:19:16,970 --> 00:19:18,020
Ying Ying, look at me.

231
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:19,090
Look at me when I talk.

232
00:19:19,780 --> 00:19:20,580
Look at me.

233
00:19:46,700 --> 00:19:47,610
Very good.

234
00:19:52,580 --> 00:19:53,210
Just you.

235
00:19:54,370 --> 00:19:55,300
No, no, no.

236
00:19:55,490 --> 00:19:56,060
I can't.

237
00:19:56,330 --> 00:19:57,540
I can't, I really can't.

238
00:20:02,610 --> 00:20:03,060
Sis.

239
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:12,180
Just do it later

240
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:12,780
whatever I say.

241
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,820
Don't ask anything.

242
00:20:14,330 --> 00:20:15,660
The boss witnessed everything.

243
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,370
I don't want to do it anymore!

244
00:21:08,900 --> 00:21:10,580
Surface.

245
00:21:12,580 --> 00:21:13,780
Surface.

246
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,780
Surface.

247
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,820
Injury time was less than six hours.

248
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:22,900
It looks like there is active bleeding.

249
00:22:23,130 --> 00:22:24,130
The probability of reconnection is quite high.

250
00:22:24,370 --> 00:22:25,020
Oh yes.

251
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:26,370
Ask his family where the severed finger is.

252
00:22:26,370 --> 00:22:26,780
Good.

253
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:27,970
Prepare for suture debridement surgery.

254
00:22:27,970 --> 00:22:28,420
Stop the bleeding first.

255
00:22:28,420 --> 00:22:28,700
Good.

256
00:22:28,970 --> 00:22:29,420
You see.

257
00:22:29,850 --> 00:22:31,300
The broken ends are very neat.

258
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:32,370
The wound is also clean.

259
00:22:55,090 --> 00:22:55,610
Halo.

260
00:22:56,250 --> 00:22:57,850
Return Yuze's severed finger to me.

261
00:22:57,850 --> 00:22:59,900
I beg you, I beg you.

262
00:23:26,330 --> 00:23:27,090
Sorry.

263
00:23:27,420 --> 00:23:28,060
Slowly.

264
00:23:29,250 --> 00:23:30,210
Sorry, sorry.

265
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:35,540
Miss Ke, Miss Ke!

266
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,020
The chairman of the board of directors is in a meeting.

267
00:23:37,130 --> 00:23:38,090
Last month you...

268
00:23:38,420 --> 00:23:39,090
Miss Ke!

269
00:23:43,580 --> 00:23:44,210
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

270
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:45,850
I can't stop it.

271
00:23:51,580 --> 00:23:52,330
Mr. Feng.

272
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,580
I was looking for you because there was an urgent matter.

273
00:23:56,090 --> 00:23:57,900
Can I talk to you one-on-one for a moment?

274
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,660
Feng Xiaosheng.

275
00:24:33,300 --> 00:24:34,780
If you want revenge, just do it to me.

276
00:24:35,420 --> 00:24:36,900
Don't hurt innocent people, okay?

277
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:43,420
Everyone should pay the price for what they have done.

278
00:24:45,850 --> 00:24:46,370
One more.

279
00:24:48,090 --> 00:24:49,660
Are you here to fight with me?

280
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:57,090
I came here to beg you.

281
00:25:08,250 --> 00:25:08,780
Halo.

282
00:25:11,130 --> 00:25:11,900
Where's the finger piece?

283
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:16,090
Leng Tou wants to carry out his duties more perfectly,

284
00:25:16,490 --> 00:25:18,250
So, he put the severed finger in a plastic bag,

285
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:19,370
then, taken out.

286
00:25:19,970 --> 00:25:21,420
I ask you, where is the finger?

287
00:25:22,780 --> 00:25:23,370
It's been thrown away.

288
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:24,580
Where?

289
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:37,330
Not far after leaving there, he was thrown carelessly on the street.

290
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,300
Mr. Feng.

291
00:26:37,820 --> 00:26:38,900
Help him look for it.

292
00:26:40,250 --> 00:26:40,730
Good.

293
00:26:41,130 --> 00:26:41,970
Hurry, help find!

294
00:27:06,540 --> 00:27:07,250
Miss Ke!

295
00:27:07,370 --> 00:27:08,420
We've been looking ahead there.

296
00:27:08,420 --> 00:27:09,130
There isn't any.

297
00:27:09,330 --> 00:27:11,850
Maybe it was taken away by a stray cat or dog.

298
00:27:12,540 --> 00:27:13,820
What are you saying?

299
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:16,660
Still not quick to go looking?

300
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,580
Never mind, Sis Qiang.

301
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:55,370
Miss Ke, wake up.

302
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,330
Mr. Feng, I...

303
00:29:20,850 --> 00:29:23,330
I asked you to cut off your hand, but instead you cut off your little finger!

304
00:29:29,850 --> 00:29:30,300
Mr. Feng.

305
00:29:30,300 --> 00:29:31,850
Now I'll take her hand.

306
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:36,730
Watch closely.

307
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,850
Let me see.

308
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:15,940
Clear.

309
00:30:16,300 --> 00:30:17,490
Who told you to pretend to be a good person?

310
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:24,850
Release!

311
00:30:26,660 --> 00:30:27,850
Why do you have so much nonsense?

312
00:30:28,540 --> 00:30:29,250
Chase!

313
00:30:38,540 --> 00:30:43,340
(Emergency Installation)

314
00:30:44,490 --> 00:30:45,020
Kak Qiang.

315
00:30:45,060 --> 00:30:46,540
There's... there's a police car, what's this?

316
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:52,940
Kak Qiang.

317
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:54,820
Are they coming to arrest us?

318
00:30:55,330 --> 00:30:56,850
Don't scare yourself.

319
00:31:01,970 --> 00:31:02,730
Wu.

320
00:31:03,250 --> 00:31:03,820
You go.

321
00:31:06,780 --> 00:31:08,660
Also check your arms.

322
00:31:11,850 --> 00:31:12,300
No problem.

323
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:14,940
Umbrella.

324
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:49,330
Have you found the finger fragment?

325
00:31:55,660 --> 00:31:56,900
If that's the case, I can't do anything either.

326
00:31:57,130 --> 00:31:59,730
Oh, yes, this lady was the one who brought the patient here.

327
00:32:00,090 --> 00:32:01,940
As for what really happened, you can ask him.

328
00:32:02,180 --> 00:32:02,540
Good.

329
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:03,660
I'll see another patient first.

330
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:08,330
You're the one who took the patient to the hospital, right?

331
00:32:20,900 --> 00:32:21,900
You note this one.

332
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:22,970
Send it to me later.

333
00:32:23,020 --> 00:32:23,490
Good.

334
00:32:26,970 --> 00:32:27,780
Halo, Rade, River.

335
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,370
Hello, how?

336
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:30,250
What do you see?

337
00:32:30,850 --> 00:32:32,660
The police are questioning Miss Ke.

338
00:32:40,370 --> 00:32:42,130
What is your relationship with the victim?

339
00:32:46,540 --> 00:32:47,820
They reported the police.

340
00:32:51,610 --> 00:32:52,370
I know.

341
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:53,940
You guys go back first.

342
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:55,700
Find a place to hide for a few days.

343
00:32:55,700 --> 00:32:56,730
Good, Mr. Feng.

344
00:33:00,210 --> 00:33:00,970
I...

345
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:04,460
(Emergency Aid)

346
00:33:08,210 --> 00:33:09,250
I received a call first.

347
00:33:19,450 --> 00:33:19,970
Halo.

348
00:33:20,210 --> 00:33:20,820
Ying.

349
00:33:22,090 --> 00:33:23,250
How is Doctor Yang's condition?

350
00:33:23,970 --> 00:33:24,780
Are you okay?

351
00:33:26,730 --> 00:33:27,940
I heard I've reported it to the police.

352
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:32,610
I believe the police will definitely protect Doctor Yang's safety.

353
00:33:33,090 --> 00:33:34,610
Regarding your parents, don't worry.

354
00:33:35,660 --> 00:33:37,090
I will take good care of them.

355
00:33:51,490 --> 00:33:52,210
Ke's mother

356
00:33:56,180 --> 00:33:56,780
Mother Ke?

357
00:34:07,330 --> 00:34:09,410
My friend called to ask how he was doing.

358
00:34:10,650 --> 00:34:11,650
Well then, let's continue.

359
00:34:12,170 --> 00:34:13,860
What is your relationship with the victim?

360
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,250
Friend.

361
00:34:22,300 --> 00:34:23,450
Friend?

362
00:34:23,690 --> 00:34:24,490
Is it just friends?

363
00:34:31,410 --> 00:34:32,650
Who injured the victim,

364
00:34:32,650 --> 00:34:33,540
do you know?

365
00:34:37,540 --> 00:34:38,540
(I heard I've reported it to the police.)

366
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:42,690
(I believe the police will definitely protect Doctor Yang's safety.)

367
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:44,450
(Regarding your parents, don't worry.)

368
00:34:44,820 --> 00:34:46,140
(I will take good care of them.)

369
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:52,820
I don't know.

370
00:34:54,650 --> 00:34:55,620
Don't you know?

371
00:34:56,250 --> 00:34:57,450
However, according to the victim,

372
00:34:57,650 --> 00:34:59,450
chairman of the board of directors of the Feng Group,

373
00:34:59,450 --> 00:35:01,540
Feng Xiaosheng who sent people to break into your house,

374
00:35:01,780 --> 00:35:03,170
beating the victim,

375
00:35:03,620 --> 00:35:05,490
and cut off the little finger of the victim.

376
00:35:06,060 --> 00:35:07,820
At that time, you were also there, right?

377
00:35:15,020 --> 00:35:20,020
(Emergency Installation; Emergency Aid)

378
00:35:30,730 --> 00:35:31,620
Sorry.

379
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:34,490
Why lie?

380
00:35:38,690 --> 00:35:40,690
You clearly know those people were ordered by him.

381
00:35:43,410 --> 00:35:44,650
Why say you don't know?

382
00:35:48,450 --> 00:35:49,300
The problem...

383
00:35:51,170 --> 00:35:53,170
not what you think.

384
00:35:53,380 --> 00:35:54,730
So, what does the problem actually look like?

385
00:35:54,730 --> 00:35:55,730
You tell me!

386
00:36:08,020 --> 00:36:09,620
Ke Ying, what are you really afraid of?

387
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,210
Are you afraid of Feng Xiaosheng?

388
00:36:16,210 --> 00:36:18,340
He besides secretly does the dirty work,

389
00:36:18,340 --> 00:36:19,580
what else could he do?

390
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,580
No matter how powerful he is,

391
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:22,690
does he dare to kill me?

392
00:36:25,300 --> 00:36:27,170
Don't talk carelessly, don't talk carelessly.

393
00:36:29,060 --> 00:36:31,060
Can you tell me the truth?

394
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,930
Surface.

395
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,540
Maybe you don't understand something yet.

396
00:37:11,540 --> 00:37:13,690
Maybe you are also not ready to face this reality,

397
00:37:13,690 --> 00:37:14,580
that is...

398
00:37:17,580 --> 00:37:19,260
Feng Xiaosheng did not force me.

399
00:37:20,540 --> 00:37:22,020
I was with him of my own accord.

400
00:37:28,650 --> 00:37:29,620
You understand me.

401
00:37:31,410 --> 00:37:32,970
I'm a very competitive person.

402
00:37:34,860 --> 00:37:38,730
I'm not willing to just be an ordinary lecturer on campus.

403
00:37:39,300 --> 00:37:40,730
Lifetime only on campus,

404
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,820
teaching students, cultivating qualifications.

405
00:37:42,820 --> 00:37:43,690
So what?

406
00:37:43,780 --> 00:37:45,650
Spending life like uncles and aunts,

407
00:37:47,620 --> 00:37:48,250
is that not good?

408
00:37:48,580 --> 00:37:49,140
Good.

409
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:56,690
However, that wasn't the life I wanted.

410
00:37:59,780 --> 00:38:00,780
Just because of this...

411
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,250
are you leaving me?

412
00:38:26,780 --> 00:38:27,690
Do you love him?

413
00:38:30,490 --> 00:38:31,860
Love or not, it doesn't matter.

414
00:38:32,250 --> 00:38:33,020
The important thing is

415
00:38:33,650 --> 00:38:35,540
he can give me what I want.

416
00:38:43,620 --> 00:38:44,780
Let's just break up, Yuze.

417
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,380
I'm materialistic.

418
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:51,490
I choose the new over the old.

419
00:38:51,970 --> 00:38:53,100
I don't deserve you.

420
00:38:53,650 --> 00:38:57,730
I was also the one who harmed you, dragged you, made you like this.

421
00:38:57,820 --> 00:38:58,820
I wronged you.

422
00:39:11,540 --> 00:39:12,860
Besides, today's problem...

423
00:39:14,020 --> 00:39:16,140
I believe, he also just acted impulsively.

424
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,410
You're the one looking for trouble with him.

425
00:39:19,170 --> 00:39:20,540
I apologize to you on his behalf.

426
00:39:21,930 --> 00:39:24,140
I also hope you don't hold him accountable again.

427
00:39:28,300 --> 00:39:30,020
You're asking me not to worry about it any more?

428
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,930
If you insist on making a big deal out of it,

429
00:39:33,300 --> 00:39:35,380
I will turn myself in to the police and say that

430
00:39:35,540 --> 00:39:37,170
I ordered people to beat you.

431
00:39:37,580 --> 00:39:39,380
The goal is to force you to break up with me.

432
00:39:39,580 --> 00:39:40,450
Ke Ying!

433
00:39:59,340 --> 00:40:02,100
(Emergency Aid)

434
00:41:28,890 --> 00:41:29,820
Just calm down.

435
00:41:31,020 --> 00:41:32,540
He promised me.

436
00:41:33,970 --> 00:41:35,340
He wouldn't mind it any more.

437
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,780
He dared make a big deal out of it?

438
00:41:40,890 --> 00:41:41,890
Is there any evidence?

439
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:43,970
Ke Ying.

440
00:41:44,690 --> 00:41:46,170
You can tell him to make a big deal out of it.

441
00:41:47,140 --> 00:41:48,690
Just see who will kill who first.

442
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:51,860
Don't put too much pressure on other people.

443
00:41:54,300 --> 00:41:57,210
At most, fight tooth and nail, then die together.

444
00:42:00,650 --> 00:42:03,100
Like last time on the roof.

445
00:42:09,100 --> 00:42:10,380
You actually reminded me.

446
00:42:12,490 --> 00:42:13,970
We can really play

447
00:42:14,620 --> 00:42:15,890
the game dies together.

448
00:42:17,730 --> 00:42:19,380
Beloved fiancé for many years,

449
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:21,730
turned out to be materialistic, so in the end he preferred conglomerates.

450
00:42:22,450 --> 00:42:24,170
Doctor Yang couldn't bear the blow...

451
00:42:26,250 --> 00:42:28,020
First of all, he killed his fiancee's parents,

452
00:42:28,340 --> 00:42:30,410
then kidnapped his fiancé to the mountains,

453
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,250
then jump off the cliff together.

454
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:35,250
How does this story go?

455
00:42:36,460 --> 00:42:38,510
Can it be considered dead together as you say?

456
00:42:43,300 --> 00:42:46,140
Last time you suddenly told reporters that you were my fiancé.

457
00:42:46,490 --> 00:42:49,140
Isn't it because you're afraid I'll harm you?

458
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:51,490
Now it's good.

459
00:42:52,690 --> 00:42:54,020
With the cooperation of Doctor Yang,

460
00:42:54,970 --> 00:42:56,860
everyone's attention will be on you.

461
00:42:58,170 --> 00:42:59,450
Who will suspect me?

462
00:43:05,930 --> 00:43:07,450
You really are an animal.

463
00:43:09,380 --> 00:43:09,970
Of.

464
00:43:11,650 --> 00:43:12,690
I'm an animal.

465
00:43:14,970 --> 00:43:16,100
So, don't mess with me.

466
00:43:18,100 --> 00:43:19,650
Don't mess with me.

467
00:43:20,970 --> 00:43:22,340
Be careful, I bite you to death.
