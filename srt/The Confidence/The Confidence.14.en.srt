=Episode 14=

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,280
You listen to Big Brother talking.

4
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:38,640
Don't think about useless things.

5
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:41,320
Understand?

6
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:42,120
What it should be

7
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,520
what do you think now?

8
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:47,000
What you have to think about now is

9
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,800
how to serve Master Feng well.

10
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,920
How to make Mr. Feng,

11
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:54,120
this god of wealth...

12
00:01:54,440 --> 00:01:55,120
true, right?

13
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:56,760
Well served.

14
00:01:57,720 --> 00:02:00,880
Then, make more money,

15
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,360
build a family, find a wife.

16
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:05,800
Same with you.

17
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:10,400
I...

18
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,000
don't have a path like you.

19
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:15,400
If only I could

20
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:17,080
hug Mr. Feng's legs.

21
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,640
Even if I dream, I will wake up happy.

22
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:22,000
Kak Qiang.

23
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:25,320
Pour Feng is quite a good person,

24
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:26,920
approachable.

25
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:28,520
Really?

26
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,440
Well then, in front of Pour Feng,

27
00:02:32,440 --> 00:02:33,880
often mention myself.

28
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,440
Open the way for your Brother Qiang.

29
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:39,760
Stay cool.

30
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,920
Come, come, come.

31
00:03:17,320 --> 00:03:19,000
(Chen Jinyan)

32
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,560
(Chen Jinyan)

33
00:03:51,880 --> 00:03:53,360
How could I forget?

34
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:55,280
Forget that you don't smoke.

35
00:03:58,560 --> 00:03:59,440
If so, I'm the one smoking.

36
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:00,960
You just see.

37
00:04:07,960 --> 00:04:09,000
Looks like you too

38
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:10,880
I really don't support smoking.

39
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:13,360
OK, then I'll turn it off.

40
00:04:13,760 --> 00:04:15,840
I turn it off so as not to make you suffocate.

41
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,120
Uncle Chen,

42
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:37,160
mari.

43
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,560
I toast you.

44
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:04,840
Look at yourself.

45
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,080
Such a good person,

46
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:12,120
eventually

47
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:13,680
lucky like this.

48
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,400
You see the people who are still alive.

49
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:24,280
Become an official, collect money.

50
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,800
Traveling all dirty and clean roads.

51
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:30,600
While you...

52
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:04,080
You are different from them.

53
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,160
You have more conscience than them.

54
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:07,840
You have a greater sense of justice than them.

55
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,480
You are more sincere than them.

56
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:10,600
Moreover,

57
00:06:11,080 --> 00:06:12,480
You also have your own limits.

58
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,600
While you are alive,

59
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,080
You lecture me...

60
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,800
what is good and bad,

61
00:06:22,040 --> 00:06:23,520
what is justice.

62
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,960
What is kindness?

63
00:06:31,560 --> 00:06:32,680
What is justice?

64
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:01,680
good morning,

65
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:03,080
Mother father.

66
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:04,080
My son,

67
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,840
hurry here for breakfast.

68
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:07,600
I didn't have breakfast, I had an appointment with a friend.

69
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,440
Just startled me.

70
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:14,000
This morning,

71
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:15,400
You're choking on flies, aren't you?

72
00:07:17,480 --> 00:07:18,680
I call you back,

73
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:19,800
not for a day

74
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:21,960
hang out with your friends.

75
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:24,960
So, why did you call me back?

76
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,440
Fighting over family property with Sheng?

77
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:29,640
I asked you to come back to help me find the money.

78
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:30,600
no,

79
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:32,120
the police just can't find it,

80
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:33,600
where should I look?

81
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,120
Money?

82
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:37,240
What money?

83
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:41,840
None of your business.

84
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:43,520
After you finish eating, you go back and rest.

85
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:45,080
I want to talk to Ruichi.

86
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,600
What's wrong with you?

87
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,360
Still hiding behind me.

88
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:51,440
Mother,

89
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:52,880
this problem

90
00:07:53,240 --> 00:07:54,440
is a little secret between

91
00:07:54,440 --> 00:07:55,520
me and dad.

92
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:57,600
Mom, go upstairs first, okay?

93
00:07:58,880 --> 00:07:59,680
I'm too lazy to listen

94
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,160
your dirty problem.

95
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:13,920
Ayah,

96
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:16,200
some trouble before I come back,

97
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,160
I also don't dare to speak.

98
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,640
Half a year when Sheng is not in office,

99
00:08:19,760 --> 00:08:21,000
my business is in Thailand

100
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,120
also affected.

101
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,520
So, I too have thought,

102
00:08:24,160 --> 00:08:25,360
critical times like these,

103
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:27,520
our family should not be messed up.

104
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:29,440
Father and son must be of one mind,

105
00:08:29,640 --> 00:08:30,840
brothers exert joint efforts.

106
00:08:31,960 --> 00:08:32,800
The two of them

107
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:34,040
hiding everything from us.

108
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,440
Who are you on the same mind as?

109
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,560
What is he hiding from me?

110
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,920
Isn't he hiding anything from you?

111
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:42,120
How could uncle hide something from me?

112
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:46,200
You're...

113
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:50,240
People have sold you, you even help count the money from your sales.

114
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:52,640
Did he ever tell you

115
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,840
that he was the one who killed Dao Jian?

116
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:55,480
Did he ever tell you

117
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:56,920
that he swallowed more than 40 million of my money.

118
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:03,040
I've sent someone to investigate.

119
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,840
Mayat Dao Jian

120
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:08,440
found among piles of rubbish.

121
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:09,760
The money he stole,

122
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:10,960
not even a penny was found.

123
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,320
In addition, according to police investigations,

124
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:17,400
It is very possible that the perpetrator of the murder was someone close to him.

125
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:21,240
Do you know what is meant by the perpetrator of the murder being a close person?

126
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:23,760
Ayah.

127
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:28,040
Is your information correct?

128
00:09:29,840 --> 00:09:31,920
I spent a lot of money to buy this information.

129
00:09:33,160 --> 00:09:35,720
The Criminal Investigation Unit Captain told me directly.

130
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,280
Do you think it's right or not?

131
00:09:51,960 --> 00:09:52,840
Mari,

132
00:09:53,320 --> 00:09:54,640
drinking tea.

133
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,680
This tea can maintain health,

134
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,120
better than those obscure drinks you young people have

135
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:04,400
drink often.

136
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:06,320
Uncle.

137
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:09,440
Don't take matters with your father too seriously.

138
00:10:09,720 --> 00:10:11,280
He never really understood

139
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:12,800
that he is an unwise person.

140
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:15,160
Stay cool.

141
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,440
Anyway all one family.

142
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:20,760
I won't even take my annoyance to heart.

143
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:22,080
Despite being angry,

144
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:24,960
at least just beat him up.

145
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,560
I have to do it myself.

146
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:31,360
Uncle, you are joking again.

147
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:33,080
Actually,

148
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,960
can't blame your dad for panicking.

149
00:10:36,840 --> 00:10:39,960
The current domestic situation is critical.

150
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:43,960
What's more, our family is at the cusp of the storm,

151
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:45,960
going forward or backward is all wrong.

152
00:10:47,840 --> 00:10:49,200
Don't know when

153
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:51,680
will be overturned by a big wave.

154
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:54,960
However,

155
00:10:55,240 --> 00:10:56,640
there is any kind of turmoil,

156
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,240
the mind cannot be disturbed.

157
00:11:00,960 --> 00:11:01,680
Good.

158
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,120
Ruichi understands.

159
00:11:03,960 --> 00:11:06,880
Your father lacks knowledge.

160
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:08,920
Impetuous.

161
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:11,400
Meanwhile, Sheng

162
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,400
too much learning, stiff and old-fashioned.

163
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:17,360
There are several things

164
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:19,960
which only Uncle can delegate to you.

165
00:11:23,240 --> 00:11:24,760
Everyone counts

166
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:27,360
you're just having fun abroad.

167
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:31,240
However, I know you work very hard.

168
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:35,560
These few years,

169
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,680
you manage the business very well.

170
00:11:39,560 --> 00:11:41,600
Especially with that Dan Yue.

171
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,680
Such a difficult person to deal with,

172
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,680
but you did very well.

173
00:11:49,400 --> 00:11:51,360
I'm very satisfied.

174
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:54,880
He is an old fox.

175
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,760
There is money, anything can be discussed.

176
00:11:56,960 --> 00:11:58,080
When there's no money,

177
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:00,400
he even dared to kill his own mother.

178
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:04,800
Come here.

179
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:10,960
You brought this gift,

180
00:12:12,080 --> 00:12:13,400
and give it to him.

181
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:21,360
Uncle,

182
00:12:21,960 --> 00:12:24,640
Isn't this gift too much?

183
00:12:24,960 --> 00:12:27,120
You convey my message to him,

184
00:12:27,960 --> 00:12:30,360
Say this is the message I said myself from my mouth.

185
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,600
Our friendship

186
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:36,320
is forever.

187
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:40,160
Even though it's a bit difficult,

188
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:41,680
but you take it easy.

189
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:43,120
Hand me the goods,

190
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:44,800
definitely no problem.

191
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:48,320
From this problem of your father,

192
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:51,760
don't know how many pairs of eyes there are...

(Cash check; 200 thousand yuan)

200
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,440
In this way,

201
00:13:38,440 --> 00:13:40,120
no problem, right?

202
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:41,720

Come on, let me measure your arm length.

Please choose anything.

210
00:14:06,280 --> 00:14:07,280
Thank you, Young Master Chi.

211
00:14:07,280 --> 00:14:08,240
I go first.

212
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:09,240
Good.

213
00:14:09,960 --> 00:14:10,520
Come, come, come.

214
00:14:10,520 --> 00:14:11,840
You look at this shirt.

215
00:14:11,840 --> 00:14:13,360
It is imported from Italy.

216
00:14:14,960 --> 00:14:15,960
Don't be slow both of you.

217
00:14:15,960 --> 00:14:16,920
Get on the bus quickly.

218
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:17,920
The bus will leave soon.

219
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:24,200
Who?

220
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,120
I also do not know.

221
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:28,120
Looks like a bully call.

222
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,960
Which shirt do you like?

223
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:33,440
This.

Everything is complete,

just you.

226
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:41,040
Sorry, sorry.

227
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:41,920
Get up quickly, get up quickly.

228
00:14:45,640 --> 00:14:46,280

229
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:47,080
This side.

230
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:48,200
Thank You.

231
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:51,880

we as volunteers,

233
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:54,000
Will you stay at a resort?

234
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:54,680
Is it true?

235
00:14:54,680 --> 00:14:55,840
Really, Mrs. Ke?

236
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:56,960
Don't rush,

237
00:14:56,960 --> 00:14:58,560
the committee will arrange it.

238
00:14:58,720 --> 00:14:59,800
Okay.

239
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:02,840
God bless us so that this time we can get a good place.

240
00:15:02,920 --> 00:15:03,760
Fine.

242
00:15:05,240 --> 00:15:05,880
You guys see.

243
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:06,920
Itu Yu Chengbo, 'kan?

244
00:15:07,800 --> 00:15:08,640
Seems right.

245
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:10,000
Let me see.

246
00:15:15,160 --> 00:15:16,000
So handsome.

247
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,280
Finally he came back.

248
00:15:53,200 --> 00:15:54,760
I thought you went to Africa to fight.

249
00:15:57,240 --> 00:15:58,400
The war is over.

250
00:15:59,760 --> 00:16:01,320
My father once said one thing.

251
00:16:01,960 --> 00:16:04,080
The person who conquers himself is a warrior.

252
00:16:05,280 --> 00:16:06,640
The fighter has gone home.

253
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:10,640
Keep your word.

00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:58,320
Has he become a stray dog ​​like them?

256
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,280
Didn't you say, in your field of profession

257
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,120
Excessive curiosity can make people die quickly?

258
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,040
Did I ever say that?

259
00:17:07,040 --> 00:17:08,080
Once.

260
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:11,840
Maybe there is.

261
00:17:11,840 --> 00:17:12,640
What's possible?

262
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:13,640
You said that.

263
00:17:13,800 --> 00:17:14,360
Correct.

264
00:17:18,360 --> 00:17:19,760
Do you think that young man can be trusted?

265
00:17:20,200 --> 00:17:21,200
How long has this been,

266
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:22,360
why is it still not here?

267
00:17:24,200 --> 00:17:26,640
That's right, 20 minutes late.

268
00:17:26,920 --> 00:17:27,840
It shouldn't be like this.

Halo, Rade, River.

271
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,360
OK, I'll go there now.

272
00:17:50,360 --> 00:17:51,480
Mr. Feng currently doesn't use a car.

273
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:52,280
He is close.

274
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:54,880
Fine, no problem.

275
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:56,040
Ok, it is finished.

276
00:18:16,240 --> 00:18:17,080
Strange.

277
00:18:17,080 --> 00:18:17,560
Logically,

278
00:18:17,560 --> 00:18:19,280
this young man should be trustworthy.

279
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:25,400
Call him?

280
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:29,200
Isn't it too risky?

281
00:18:30,760 --> 00:18:32,120
No problem.

282
00:18:32,200 --> 00:18:33,400
I'm a doctor.

283
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:35,720
Call the patient and check,

284
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:37,640
it should be.

285
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,400
Not pick up.

286
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:22,000
Can't lift?

287
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:26,560
Not free to lift?

288
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,680
Don't want to pick up?

289

Can't lift?

290

No...

291
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,360
Where are you going?

00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:42,760

293
00:19:42,760 --> 00:19:45,120
Can be a little faster, right? It'll be too late.

294
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:48,200
Okay.

295
00:19:50,280 --> 00:19:51,720
I told you you don't need to take it.

I am your father's driver.

00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:20,760
Wow, this...

00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:22,120
Is this possible?

310
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:23,160
Brother Qiang, you talk like that,

311
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,040
just like an outsider.

You are my boss.

Did you see what car my father brought?

341

What brand?

344
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,040
I didn't even know.

345
00:21:46,360 --> 00:21:48,120
Ask your father and you'll know.

346
00:21:48,520 --> 00:21:50,400
Can't it be said now?

347
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:52,720
Not very free.

348
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:54,120
Let's go.

Let us go home.

Later when Mr. Feng needs a car, he's afraid he won't find one.

353

383
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:50,240
Recently, our office was investigating a case.

384
00:23:50,600 --> 00:23:52,320
Murder and body dumping cases.

385
00:23:52,800 --> 00:23:54,320
Some people reported,

386
00:23:54,920 --> 00:23:56,320
while the victim is still alive,

387
00:23:56,680 --> 00:23:58,440
he has been in contact with you.

388
00:24:00,280 --> 00:24:01,560
Just for the sake of it?

389
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,400
Correct.

390
00:24:03,920 --> 00:24:05,040
You should tell me too

391
00:24:05,040 --> 00:24:06,120
who is the victim?

392
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:06,680
I just found out

393
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:07,880
have you ever had contact with me?

394
00:24:09,640 --> 00:24:11,200
You see how I am,

395
00:24:11,440 --> 00:24:13,160
been busy checking cases lately,

396
00:24:13,160 --> 00:24:14,280
very sleep deprived.

397
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:16,160
My mind was confused.

398
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:18,680
The victim

399
00:24:19,400 --> 00:24:21,520
is a manager of the Jujinxiao nightclub.

400
00:24:22,040 --> 00:24:23,160
Namanya Zhang Zhigao.

401
00:24:23,800 --> 00:24:24,920
He also has a nickname,

402
00:24:25,840 --> 00:24:27,400
called...

403
00:24:27,640 --> 00:24:28,560
Dipanggil Dao Jian.

404
00:24:28,560 --> 00:24:29,920
Benar, Dao Jian.

405
00:24:30,160 --> 00:24:31,560
I know this person.

406
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:33,760
My uncle owns some shares in the nightclub he manages.

407
00:24:34,160 --> 00:24:35,400
He also invited me

408
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,680
to come to his nightclub.

409
00:24:37,160 --> 00:24:38,640
However, I'm usually very busy.

410
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,400
I don't like places like that either.

411
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:41,680
I understand.

412
00:24:44,560 --> 00:24:45,600
He is the victim?

413
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:49,360
Don't know the killer

414
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,840
how big is his grudge?

415
00:24:51,960 --> 00:24:53,520
However, he died quite horribly.

416
00:24:56,040 --> 00:24:56,880
Mr. Feng.

417
00:24:57,040 --> 00:24:58,680
It's not that I don't believe you.

418
00:24:58,680 --> 00:25:00,320
We are just carrying out investigation protocols.

419
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:01,680
I'll ask again.

420
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,880
Please be informed.

421
00:25:04,560 --> 00:25:06,200
October 21st,

422
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:08,320
Where are you currently?

423
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:09,960
Do what?

424
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,360
21 October...

425
00:25:18,440 --> 00:25:19,560
Please wait a moment.

426
00:25:27,120 --> 00:25:27,920
An.

427
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,200
Good.

428
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:32,880
Please change.

429
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:33,560
Good.

430
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,680
Usually I have a lot of things to do.

431
00:25:36,680 --> 00:25:37,600
Entire schedule

432
00:25:37,600 --> 00:25:38,360
arranged by the secretary.

433
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:39,320
I understand.

434
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,560
You are a very busy person.

435
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:44,960
Please check

436
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:45,640
our schedule

437
00:25:45,640 --> 00:25:46,680
October 21st.

438
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:48,560
That was last Sunday.

439
00:25:49,160 --> 00:25:49,680
Good.

440
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:54,680
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

441
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,160
that day you rest,

442
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:57,560
go fishing for the day.

443
00:25:58,840 --> 00:25:59,680
I've remembered.

444
00:25:59,680 --> 00:26:00,320
Correct.

445
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:02,280
I've been gone since dawn,

446
00:26:02,280 --> 00:26:03,880
and return to land when it gets dark.

447
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:05,600
Are you alone?

448
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Is there anyone else

449
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:09,200
who can prove your statement?

450
00:26:10,600 --> 00:26:11,200
Ada.

451
00:26:11,200 --> 00:26:12,680
That day my driver was with me.

452
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,200
Call Wu here.

453
00:26:15,560 --> 00:26:16,200
Good.

454
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:17,680
Please wait a moment.

455
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:19,560
Good.

456
00:26:26,200 --> 00:26:28,040
Pick up the phone.

457
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:31,440
Secretary An.

458
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:32,320
I'm here.

459
00:26:32,520 --> 00:26:33,120
I was going to the toilet.

460
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:33,800
What is it?

461
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:35,200
What a panic, what's going on?

462
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:37,920
The Chairman of the Board of Directors is waiting for you.

463
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:38,320
Fast.

464
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:38,840
Fine.

465
00:26:38,840 --> 00:26:39,680
I'm coming, I'm coming.

466
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,760
I don't mean to complain to you,

467
00:26:52,560 --> 00:26:54,440
We are police officers,

468
00:26:54,960 --> 00:26:56,960
From the outside it looks dignified.

469
00:26:57,280 --> 00:26:57,920
Actually,

470
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:58,760
we also save

471
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:00,520
bitterness in each of our hearts.

472
00:27:01,680 --> 00:27:02,680
Throughout the year

473
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:04,080
produce not much,

474
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,040
passes to feed the family,

475
00:27:06,040 --> 00:27:07,960
we didn't even dare to think about anything else.

476
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:09,560
Still want to buy your child a house?

477
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:10,600
We're on our own

478
00:27:10,600 --> 00:27:12,040
still live in the old small house.

479
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,120
Come in.

480
00:27:19,960 --> 00:27:22,040
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Wu came.

481
00:27:32,760 --> 00:27:34,200
Chairman of the Board of Directors, you are looking for me?

482
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:36,440
This is Captain Xiao from the Criminal Investigation Unit.

483
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,200
Xiao Tongbin.

484
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:40,800
- Hello. - Hello.

485
00:27:42,040 --> 00:27:44,120
He wants to confirm a few things with you.

486
00:27:45,360 --> 00:27:45,960
Kapten Xiao.

487
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,200
There's still some work to do

488
00:27:47,200 --> 00:27:47,960
that I need to complete.

489
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:49,840
Please step down.

490
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:51,160
Please, please.

491
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,440
Don't delay important matters.

492
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:53,280
You guys just chat.

493
00:28:23,360 --> 00:28:24,520
Young adult,

494
00:28:24,520 --> 00:28:26,080
don't be tense, please sit down.

495
00:28:26,080 --> 00:28:27,360
There are surveillance cameras.

496
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:33,520
Please sit.

497
00:28:57,720 --> 00:28:59,000
You're Wu, right?

498
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,400
There are several things

499
00:29:11,440 --> 00:29:12,600
what I need to ask you.

500
00:29:13,720 --> 00:29:15,120
October 21st,

501
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:18,480
where are you? Do what?

502
00:29:21,800 --> 00:29:23,520
Accompany the chairman of the board of directors on a fishing trip.

503
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:29,720
There's still something else,

504
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:31,440
wait a minute

505
00:29:41,040 --> 00:29:42,680
Do you know this person?

506
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:45,180
(Is there a problem?)

507
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:49,720
Do not know her.

508
00:29:58,640 --> 00:29:59,520
Okay.

509
00:30:00,480 --> 00:30:01,440
Just stop here.

510
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:04,160
If there's something,

511
00:30:04,280 --> 00:30:05,400
I will look for you again.

512
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:09,480
Good.

513
00:30:24,520 --> 00:30:25,200
Okay.

514
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:27,600
I won't disturb your work any more.

515
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:28,440
Just stop here.

516
00:30:28,800 --> 00:30:29,720
No need to deliver.

517
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:30,160
Good.

518
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:31,800
Go first, okay?

519
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:34,560
Be careful.

520
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:46,760
Say it quickly.

521
00:30:47,320 --> 00:30:48,360
What did he ask you?

522
00:30:50,360 --> 00:30:51,000
He asked me,

523
00:30:51,000 --> 00:30:52,320
what I did on Sunday.

524
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:54,160
I said go fishing with you.

525
00:30:54,960 --> 00:30:56,560
He also asked where to go fishing?

526
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:57,520
What fish do you fish for?

527
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,120
Asked lots of other questions.

528
00:31:01,600 --> 00:31:02,440
I

529
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:04,080
say what happened.

530
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,960
It is just...

531
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:09,640
Just what?

532
00:31:12,840 --> 00:31:14,200
About you going diving,

533
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:15,800
I didn't tell him.

534
00:31:25,840 --> 00:31:27,240
That really confused me.

535
00:31:27,560 --> 00:31:28,600
I didn't say anything wrong, right?

536
00:31:32,920 --> 00:31:33,840
Asking what else?

537
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,480
He also asked me,

538
00:31:35,480 --> 00:31:36,320
took out a photo and asked,

539
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:37,600
do I recognize him?

540
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:40,440
Whose photos?

541
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:43,360
I really don't know him.

542
00:31:44,480 --> 00:31:45,240
A man,

543
00:31:46,320 --> 00:31:47,120
still young.

544
00:31:47,280 --> 00:31:48,880
However, when he saw him he didn't seem like a good person.

545
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,080
What is it?

546
00:32:07,640 --> 00:32:08,160
Good.

547
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:30,160
Bring it to him.

548
00:32:30,160 --> 00:32:30,800
Good.

549
00:33:12,360 --> 00:33:13,680
Go up, talk inside.

550
00:33:23,080 --> 00:33:24,840
Captain Xiao was in such a hurry to find me,

551
00:33:25,320 --> 00:33:26,600
there must be something, right?

552
00:33:30,920 --> 00:33:31,680
What's wrong with you?

553
00:33:32,080 --> 00:33:33,160
There isn't anything.

554
00:33:33,760 --> 00:33:35,200
If it's okay, why not go to the clinic

555
00:33:35,200 --> 00:33:36,080
and don't pick up the phone?

556
00:33:36,400 --> 00:33:37,760
Do not want.

557
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:39,480
Why don't you want to?

558
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:40,760
Why so many why?

559
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:42,040
Don't want to go, yeah, don't want to go.

560
00:33:46,400 --> 00:33:47,360
Don't want to do it anymore.

561
00:33:51,160 --> 00:33:52,400
Don't want to do it anymore?

562
00:33:53,160 --> 00:33:53,800
Correct.

563
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:56,000
I...

564
00:33:57,240 --> 00:33:58,080
don't want to do it anymore.

565
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:02,160
Feeling bored,

566
00:34:03,560 --> 00:34:04,280
tired,

567
00:34:04,600 --> 00:34:06,080
anxious all day.

568
00:34:07,560 --> 00:34:08,320
Even when sleeping,

569
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,440
I'm afraid of having nightmares

570
00:34:09,440 --> 00:34:10,520
if I am betrayed.

571
00:34:11,520 --> 00:34:12,840
Didn't you say that before?

572
00:34:13,360 --> 00:34:14,360
Any time

573
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,040
I feel scared,

574
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:17,280
I can withdraw at any time.

575
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:20,080
Won't force me.

576
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:22,320
This saying still applies, right?

577
00:34:29,880 --> 00:34:32,400
Are you persuading me now?

578
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:33,840
It doesn't matter.

579
00:34:34,720 --> 00:34:36,040
I can't go out.

580
00:34:38,920 --> 00:34:40,360
What's the problem, you just order it.

581
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:48,800
Wu,

582
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:50,600
I don't care what problem you have.

583
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:52,520
However, your mind is currently in a mess.

584
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,440
I'm not making small talk with you anymore.

585
00:34:55,120 --> 00:34:56,080
Go home and find a place

586
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:56,760
to calm yourself.

587
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,560
Think about the words you just said.

588
00:34:58,960 --> 00:35:00,400
When you're done thinking, look for me again.

589
00:35:01,960 --> 00:35:03,360
I've thought it through.

590
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,360
It's a no-brainer.

591
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,400
Really gone, Captain Xiao?

592
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:13,080
You work so hard,

593
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,600
looked for me all the way to the corners of Feng Xiaosheng's eyes.

594
00:35:15,600 --> 00:35:16,800
There must be an important problem.

595
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:17,600
It's okay, say so.

596
00:35:17,880 --> 00:35:18,720
Kapten Xiao.

597
00:35:19,560 --> 00:35:20,200
As long as you order,

598
00:35:20,200 --> 00:35:21,240
I will go through storms and coals of fire

599
00:35:21,240 --> 00:35:22,040
to solve it.

600
00:35:22,040 --> 00:35:24,160
For Captain Xiao to be promoted and become rich,

601
00:35:24,160 --> 00:35:25,040
I will try my best.

602
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:25,720
Then...

603
00:35:26,040 --> 00:35:26,800
I was looking for you because

604
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:28,080
I'm afraid you'll face danger!

605
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,320
Because of my previous informant,

606
00:35:29,320 --> 00:35:29,880
same with you,

607
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:30,960
suddenly lost contact.

608
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:32,000
When found,

609
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:33,080
he's dead!

610
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,560
Therefore, I dare not wait.

611
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:36,040
Do not dare to wait even for a moment!

612
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:37,160
Do you understand?

613
00:35:40,640 --> 00:35:41,760
It's not easy being you,

614
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,680
all day dealing with bad people.

615
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:46,520
Every time facing the test of life and death,

616
00:35:47,120 --> 00:35:48,600
but you yourself also have to understand clearly.

617
00:35:49,160 --> 00:35:50,640
You're not doing all this for me,

618
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:52,000
nor for Chen's sake,

619
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:53,800
let alone nations and countries.

620
00:35:53,960 --> 00:35:55,280
However, for your own sake.

621
00:35:55,280 --> 00:35:56,520
For goodness and justice

622
00:35:56,520 --> 00:35:58,040
who is still in your heart!

623
00:36:14,800 --> 00:36:16,400
Chen has left us for more than a month.

624
00:36:16,800 --> 00:36:18,880
The investigation and collection of evidence has entered a crucial stage.

625
00:36:19,520 --> 00:36:20,320
Second uncle was already suspicious

626
00:36:20,320 --> 00:36:21,800
Feng Xiaosheng killed and stole money.

627
00:36:22,560 --> 00:36:24,560
Recently, the Feng family's internal affairs might have been chaotic.

628
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:25,960
You be careful.

629
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:28,320
Don't get into trouble.

630
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:41,960
Bu Ke, Bu Hou.

631
00:36:41,960 --> 00:36:43,480
These students that we brought

632
00:36:43,480 --> 00:36:44,600
has been assigned to the Department of State

633
00:36:44,600 --> 00:36:46,880
to be in charge of entertaining foreign guests who come.

634
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:48,880
For the smooth running of all your work,

635
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:50,520
Our committee has arranged for all of you

636
00:36:50,520 --> 00:36:51,960
stay at this hotel.

637
00:36:52,160 --> 00:36:53,000
Also makes it easier for you

638
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:53,960
after that you can

639
00:36:53,960 --> 00:36:57,160
establish better communication with all our guests in attendance.

640
00:36:57,160 --> 00:36:57,960
If so, that's great.

641
00:36:57,960 --> 00:36:59,960
Our team is really lucky.

642
00:36:59,960 --> 00:37:01,000
Mr. Chen and others,

643
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:01,920
everything has been arranged

644
00:37:01,920 --> 00:37:03,160
to the staff dormitory.

645
00:37:04,520 --> 00:37:05,400
This standard...

646
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,400
What's wrong with you today?

647
00:37:07,960 --> 00:37:09,680
Why daydream?

648
00:37:11,960 --> 00:37:12,720
It doesn't matter.

649
00:37:14,000 --> 00:37:15,000
Please help watch over them.

650
00:37:15,000 --> 00:37:16,080
I went on the phone for a bit.

651
00:37:16,080 --> 00:37:16,840
Thank You.

652
00:37:17,840 --> 00:37:18,640
that building,

653
00:37:18,640 --> 00:37:19,720
currently in

654
00:37:19,720 --> 00:37:20,840
room maintenance repairs.

655
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:22,200
There are safety hazards.

656
00:37:22,200 --> 00:37:23,720
Therefore, we are all included

657
00:37:23,720 --> 00:37:24,320
lecturers and students,

658
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:25,680
if there is no business, it is forbidden to go inside.

659
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:26,440
Of?

660
00:37:26,640 --> 00:37:27,120
Of.

661
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:27,880
If so, that's it.

662
00:37:28,360 --> 00:37:29,800
Everyone please rest.

663
00:37:31,740 --> 00:37:35,180
(Last Call)

664
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,720
Young Master Chi.

665
00:37:42,600 --> 00:37:43,840
How is this shirt?

666
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:46,760
Reasonable.

667
00:37:52,080 --> 00:37:53,800
Could be more focused, right?

668
00:37:58,720 --> 00:37:59,600
Good.

669
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:04,480
Can't lift.

670
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,320
From the start I didn't want to pick it up.

671
00:38:07,840 --> 00:38:09,520
(The number you dialed is busy.)

672
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:11,640
(Please call later.)

673
00:38:15,640 --> 00:38:16,560
Put it in the blacklist.

674
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:19,280
Black, black, black.

675
00:38:21,520 --> 00:38:22,240
Nice, no?

676
00:38:24,080 --> 00:38:25,760
The person is more beautiful than the clothes.

677
00:38:26,120 --> 00:38:27,080
There are still blue ones.

678
00:38:27,080 --> 00:38:27,840
You wait for me a moment.

679
00:38:48,280 --> 00:38:48,960
Halo.

680
00:38:51,840 --> 00:38:53,240
Sorry, sorry.

681
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:54,640
Halo.

682
00:39:03,920 --> 00:39:05,280
(Chen has left us for over a month.)

683
00:39:05,920 --> 00:39:07,800
(The investigation and collection of evidence has entered a crucial stage.)

684
00:39:08,640 --> 00:39:09,440
Second uncle was already suspicious

685
00:39:09,440 --> 00:39:10,800
Feng Xiaosheng killed and stole money.

686
00:39:11,360 --> 00:39:13,400
Recently, the Feng family's internal affairs might have been chaotic.

687
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:14,720
You be careful.

688
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:16,800
Don't get into trouble.

689
00:39:25,000 --> 00:39:25,680
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

690
00:39:25,880 --> 00:39:26,640
Regarding the forum,

691
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:27,720
you should still attend.

692
00:39:27,720 --> 00:39:28,640
If you are not present,

693
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:29,280
don't know how the media

694
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,080
will write about you.

695
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:32,920
Can I make him not follow me anymore?

696
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:34,840
Halo.

697
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:35,600
Chairman of the Board of Directors!

698
00:39:36,760 --> 00:39:37,560
What are you doing?

699
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:48,160
Chairman of the Board of Directors!

700
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:50,560
Chairman of the Board of Directors!

701
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:54,960
Chairman of the Board of Directors. Chairman of the Board of Directors!

702
00:40:19,920 --> 00:40:21,520
Young Master Chi, let's drink.

703
00:40:27,360 --> 00:40:28,000
Sis,

704
00:40:28,320 --> 00:40:29,480
Don't be busy working all the time.

705
00:40:30,640 --> 00:40:31,680
I have prepared the people for you.

706
00:40:31,960 --> 00:40:32,680
Come quickly.

707
00:40:33,160 --> 00:40:33,920
I'll wait for you.

708
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:34,920
I'll wait for you.

709
00:40:41,200 --> 00:40:43,120
Young Master Chi, may I toast with you?

710
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:45,040
Sure, come on.

711
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,480
(This forum, high standard,)

712
00:41:16,920 --> 00:41:17,720
(large scale,)

713
00:41:18,160 --> 00:41:19,040
(noted by many people,)

714
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,720
(and a big influence.)

715
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:22,360
(Therefore,)

716
00:41:22,720 --> 00:41:24,520
(a strong policy is needed)

717
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:26,160
(that can survive under pressure,)

718
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,680
(high comprehensive quality,)

719
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:29,880
(and strong organizational discipline.)

720
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,720
Please put the water over there

721
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:33,520
and neatly arranged, yes.

722
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,000
Good.

723
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:34,720
Please hang up

724
00:41:34,720 --> 00:41:36,640
all the curtains are well and tidy.

725
00:41:37,340 --> 00:41:40,460
(Feng Xiaosheng)

726
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:50,880
I really can't get out.

727
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:51,720
Our school is medium

728
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:52,640
participate in major activities.

729
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:53,760
I am an accompanying lecturer.

730
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:54,920
Right now I am

731
00:41:54,920 --> 00:41:56,360
it is absolutely impossible to leave the position.

732
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,000
Feng Xiaosheng.

733
00:41:58,000 --> 00:41:59,040
I'm asking you to make a little sense,

734
00:41:59,040 --> 00:41:59,880
perhaps not?

735
00:42:15,160 --> 00:42:16,800
(We hope all volunteers)

736
00:42:17,200 --> 00:42:18,160
(can fully understand)

737
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:18,800
(significance)

738
00:42:18,800 --> 00:42:20,400
(implemented this forum.)

739
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:23,960
Bu Hou.

740
00:42:24,360 --> 00:42:25,480
Meanwhile something happened to my family.

741
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,280
Quite worrying.

742
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:27,160
I have to go home first.

743
00:42:27,360 --> 00:42:28,520
Please help me watch it first, okay?

744
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,360
Thank You.

745
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:37,920
It's busy and there's a problem.

746
00:43:22,520 --> 00:43:23,400
Miss Lecturer Ke.

748
00:43:26,000 --> 00:43:27,520
