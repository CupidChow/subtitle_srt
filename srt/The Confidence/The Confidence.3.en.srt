00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,940
=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 3=

3
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,490
(Then, what should I do?)

4
00:01:49,570 --> 00:01:50,460
(Undergoing treatment.)

5
00:01:50,740 --> 00:01:51,740
(Relieve pressure)

6
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:52,780
(which is in your heart.)

7
00:01:53,780 --> 00:01:55,210
(Then, increase the portion of exercise,)

8
00:01:55,210 --> 00:01:56,610
(adjusts the balance of body and mind.)

9
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:42,780
Mother.

10
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:44,300
I am home.

11
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,610
Why did you come home so early today?

12
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:47,860
Of.

13
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:49,220
Just me, just me.

14
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:50,010
No problem.

15
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:50,940
- Just me, just me. - I'm alone.

16
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:52,530
I can, just me.

17
00:02:58,780 --> 00:03:00,220
It's so loud you can't watch TV, huh?

18
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,090
No problem.

19
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,810
Isn't it past 20.00 now?

20
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:06,090
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

21
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:07,530
I'll warm up the food.

22
00:03:20,090 --> 00:03:22,250
Love doesn't go well.

23
00:03:24,090 --> 00:03:24,980
Is there this thing?

24
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,530
Let me see.

25
00:03:30,530 --> 00:03:31,250
Come in.

26
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:32,700
The door is not locked.

27
00:03:40,250 --> 00:03:41,170
So quiet?

28
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,220
What were my ears?

29
00:03:45,220 --> 00:03:46,420
experiencing hallucinations?

30
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:48,580
May be.

31
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:50,780
Hospital in front,

32
00:03:50,780 --> 00:03:51,980
The ENT section is pretty good.

33
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:52,700
Is it true?

34
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:02,340
Found two new fingerprints.

35
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:03,580
In my judgment,

36
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,650
This fingerprint appears

37
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,730
in this one minute.

38
00:04:08,250 --> 00:04:09,060
Miao Miao.

39
00:04:10,370 --> 00:04:11,700
Is there anything you want to say?

40
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,170
Inspector Chen.

41
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:17,180
What testimony do you want to get,

42
00:04:17,420 --> 00:04:18,370
you just ask.

43
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:21,370
You're quite stubborn.

44
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,980
The interrogation begins.

45
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:37,930
Miao Miao.

46
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:38,900
What happened

47
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:40,210
in these last two days?

48
00:04:42,250 --> 00:04:43,700
Arrogant attitude.

49
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,860
There is a fight in the heart.

50
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:46,980
I'm telling you,

51
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:47,810
even if you don't testify,

52
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:48,770
I also have a way.

53
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:51,420
Based on your current expression,

54
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,980
your attitude now,

55
00:04:53,250 --> 00:04:54,460
I guess now

56
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:55,860
you are rejected by men.

57
00:05:00,490 --> 00:05:02,580
How many days have you just started college?

58
00:05:03,140 --> 00:05:04,250
You definitely know

59
00:05:04,250 --> 00:05:05,740
a guy on campus, right?

60
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:09,770
According to you, Chen Jinyan's daughter,

61
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:11,330
must be great.

62
00:05:12,250 --> 00:05:13,210
The man she likes,

63
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,250
must also be very great.

64
00:05:15,530 --> 00:05:16,740
Definitely not a freshman.

65
00:05:17,180 --> 00:05:18,180
Student association members?

66
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:20,180
Popular student on campus?

67
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,770
Current final semester students,

68
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:25,250
should be working as an intern,

69
00:05:25,250 --> 00:05:26,020
don't have time.

70
00:05:26,370 --> 00:05:27,650
Meanwhile, Master's students,

71
00:05:27,650 --> 00:05:28,980
It's also impossible to serve you

72
00:05:28,980 --> 00:05:30,020
the little kids.

73
00:05:30,460 --> 00:05:31,810
Tell me, second year

74
00:05:31,810 --> 00:05:32,860
or third year?

75
00:05:34,140 --> 00:05:35,530
You're still stubborn, aren't you?

76
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,580
You're...

77
00:05:39,580 --> 00:05:40,740
You're a new student,

78
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,250
how can you be so shameless

79
00:05:42,250 --> 00:05:43,900
confess your feelings to a man?

80
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,020
Surely you don't keep in touch often.

81
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,330
However, it included love at first sight.

82
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:49,020
If I didn't guess wrong,

83
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,020
then it is senior brother

84
00:05:50,020 --> 00:05:51,460
second year or third year

85
00:05:51,460 --> 00:05:53,210
who welcomes you new students

86
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:54,530
enter campus.

87
00:05:56,980 --> 00:05:57,900
Correct assessment.

88
00:05:58,460 --> 00:05:59,460
Now you tell me.

89
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,140
This boy's name,

90
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,460
height, age,

91
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:03,900
hometown, home address,

92
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:04,650
personality traits,

93
00:06:04,650 --> 00:06:05,700
- phone number... - Stop, stop.

94
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,580
- ...ID card... - Stop!

95
00:06:08,210 --> 00:06:08,900
Chen Jinyan.

96
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:11,460
I'm your daughter.

97
00:06:11,460 --> 00:06:12,740
I'm not your prisoner.

98
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:14,860
Totally treated me like a criminal.

99
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:17,700
How can directly

100
00:06:17,700 --> 00:06:19,420
call your father's name like that?

101
00:06:20,210 --> 00:06:21,740
He was upset because of this problem,

102
00:06:21,740 --> 00:06:23,020
why are you still teasing him?

103
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:24,530
Mother, I was joking with him.

104
00:06:24,530 --> 00:06:25,980
That's it.

105
00:06:26,420 --> 00:06:27,620
Base.

106
00:06:53,050 --> 00:06:53,900
Halo.

107
00:06:54,090 --> 00:06:54,930
What are you doing?

108
00:06:57,300 --> 00:06:57,980
It doesn't matter.

109
00:06:58,090 --> 00:06:58,930
I am at home.

110
00:06:59,420 --> 00:07:00,490
eat what?

111
00:07:01,180 --> 00:07:02,330
Eat an apple.

112
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:03,700
Can't always eat apples.

113
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,930
Remember to eat on time.

114
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:08,090
Later I will go see you.

115
00:08:14,810 --> 00:08:16,180
Please you believe me.

116
00:08:17,700 --> 00:08:19,180
Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie,

117
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:20,330
there's definitely a connection.

118
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,460
(Feng Xiaosheng?)

119
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,530
Halo.

120
00:09:58,820 --> 00:09:59,500
Are you Miss Ke?

121
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:01,620
Who are you?

122
00:10:02,770 --> 00:10:03,530
Your food order has arrived.

123
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:04,740
Please open the door.

124
00:10:07,180 --> 00:10:08,300
I didn't order food.

125
00:10:09,380 --> 00:10:10,420
Sorry.

126
00:10:38,980 --> 00:10:39,500
Halo.

127
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,180
Miss Ke.

128
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:41,530
I've confirmed it.

129
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:42,690
This is your order.

130
00:10:43,130 --> 00:10:44,380
I'm not at home now.

131
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:46,650
You just put it in front of the door.

132
00:10:46,650 --> 00:10:47,690
I'll be home soon.

133
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:16,180
Ying Ying.

134
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:27,180
I came to watch over you

135
00:11:27,180 --> 00:11:28,300
whether you eat well or not.

136
00:11:30,420 --> 00:11:31,770
Aren't you being too careful?

137
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:32,770
There's me.

138
00:11:34,180 --> 00:11:35,530
Being more careful isn't bad either.

139
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:37,010
This is better than being careless

140
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:38,010
gave my number to someone else.

141
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:40,620
Obviously knowing I'm home alone,

142
00:11:40,650 --> 00:11:41,820
you still order food for me.

143
00:11:42,300 --> 00:11:43,740
Aren't you afraid of the one who delivers the food?

144
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:45,010
have evil intentions,

145
00:11:45,180 --> 00:11:46,820
like committing robbery or murder?

146
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:49,090
Ying Ying.

147
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,860
There aren't that many bad people.

148
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:52,650
How do you know

149
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:53,770
aren't there so many bad people?

150
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:54,890
Do evil people write evil words?

151
00:11:54,890 --> 00:11:55,940
on their faces?

152
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:58,060
Would a bad guy have told you earlier that...

153
00:11:58,260 --> 00:11:58,940
I'm a bad person,

154
00:11:58,940 --> 00:12:00,260
I want to do evil things.

155
00:12:00,770 --> 00:12:02,010
Crime often occurs

156
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:02,940
suddenly.

157
00:12:03,060 --> 00:12:03,570
Good and bad,

158
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:04,860
not much different.

159
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:05,570
Good people sometimes

160
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:06,690
also very dangerous.

161
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:07,450
I...

162
00:12:09,940 --> 00:12:10,770
Stop it.

163
00:12:15,530 --> 00:12:16,690
Sorry, Yuze.

164
00:12:18,130 --> 00:12:19,010
Sorry.

165
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:21,130
I should be the one apologizing.

166
00:12:23,090 --> 00:12:24,380
I rarely accompany you.

167
00:12:28,210 --> 00:12:29,300
Is there really a problem

168
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:32,500
on my mind?

169
00:12:36,570 --> 00:12:37,090
Ying Ying.

170
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,770
Have you ever thought...

171
00:12:43,010 --> 00:12:44,260
we go for a walk somewhere far?

172
00:12:44,820 --> 00:12:45,820
Where to go?

173
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:51,210
Go...

174
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,010
to a foreign country.

175
00:12:55,330 --> 00:12:56,500
Looking for a place where there are no people

176
00:12:56,500 --> 00:12:57,860
who knows both of us.

177
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,450
There's just you and me.

178
00:13:02,010 --> 00:13:03,010
I'm holding you.

179
00:13:03,860 --> 00:13:04,650
You're pulling me.

180
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:06,130
Walk around without

181
00:13:06,130 --> 00:13:07,420
worry about anything on the road.

182
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,530
How?

183
00:13:16,060 --> 00:13:18,210
Can you really go with me?

184
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:19,650
Must go together.

185
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:22,570
How about this.

186
00:13:22,820 --> 00:13:23,650
We are both together

187
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:25,180
ask for permission to leave for marriage.

188
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:28,620
Then, we both went on a honeymoon.

189
00:13:30,690 --> 00:13:31,450
Good?

190
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:32,570
Good.

191
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,330
Alright, it's decided like this.

192
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:37,010
Well then, now I'll think about it

193
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,180
where are we going

194
00:13:38,530 --> 00:13:39,380
Let me think about it.

195
00:13:55,890 --> 00:13:56,500
Inspector.

196
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:58,740
The thing you want.

197
00:14:16,940 --> 00:14:18,130
Feng Xiaosheng ini...

198
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:20,090
went abroad in March.

199
00:14:20,330 --> 00:14:22,010
Stayed outside for seven months.

200
00:14:23,060 --> 00:14:24,860
Rich people, selfish.

201
00:14:27,650 --> 00:14:28,300
Zhong.

202
00:14:29,530 --> 00:14:30,650
You have to go out with me.

203
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:31,420
Where to go?

204
00:14:32,530 --> 00:14:33,860
Meeting this Feng Xiaosheng.

205
00:14:41,570 --> 00:14:42,380
Hello, Chairman of the Board of Directors.

206
00:14:42,890 --> 00:14:43,420
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

207
00:14:43,420 --> 00:14:44,570
there was a police officer surnamed Chen

208
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:45,650
who is waiting for you in the living room.

209
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:47,010
Good.

210
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:07,570
Hello, Mr. Feng.

211
00:15:08,530 --> 00:15:09,210
Hello, Officer Chen.

212
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,650
Sorry, long wait.

213
00:15:11,650 --> 00:15:12,740
I visited suddenly.

214
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:22,770
Please sit.

215
00:15:22,770 --> 00:15:23,420
Good.

216
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:26,450
Don't know what the problem is

217
00:15:26,450 --> 00:15:27,300
You looking for me?

218
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,380
Like this,

219
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,210
I have a case in my hands.

220
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:33,090
Your business card was found among

221
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,650
belongings of the people involved.

222
00:15:35,740 --> 00:15:37,130
So, I want to ask about this person

223
00:15:37,130 --> 00:15:38,260
to Mr. Feng.

224
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:39,420
Who?

225
00:15:39,620 --> 00:15:40,500
What's his name?

226
00:15:40,650 --> 00:15:41,820
This person is named

227
00:15:42,060 --> 00:15:43,620
Shen Shijie.

228
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,890
Shen Shijie?

229
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:47,210
Correct.

230
00:15:52,300 --> 00:15:54,180
Their eyes are exactly the same.

231
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,060
Sorry,

232
00:15:56,570 --> 00:15:57,620
I don't know this person.

233
00:15:58,180 --> 00:15:58,740
No problem.

234
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:00,890
I also just came to ask.

235
00:16:01,180 --> 00:16:01,860
After all, business cards

236
00:16:02,180 --> 00:16:03,820
can be obtained from various sources.

237
00:16:04,820 --> 00:16:05,980
Mr. Feng is quite busy, huh.

238
00:16:06,380 --> 00:16:07,500
Just returned from abroad.

239
00:16:07,860 --> 00:16:09,380
Went to Europe to survey for some time.

240
00:16:09,820 --> 00:16:11,300
Related to the field of new energy forces.

241
00:16:13,380 --> 00:16:14,500
I remember,

242
00:16:14,650 --> 00:16:16,650
I once heard a speech you once gave.

243
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:19,010
About six months ago,

244
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:20,820
at the Convention Center,

245
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:23,060
related to new energy.

246
00:16:25,450 --> 00:16:26,820
You said you had...

247
00:16:28,130 --> 00:16:29,060
ever dreamed.

248
00:16:29,980 --> 00:16:31,530
I felt scared when I listened to it at that time.

249
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:33,860
So, Mr. Feng you are committed to

250
00:16:33,860 --> 00:16:35,300
carry out new energy development.

251
00:16:36,380 --> 00:16:37,060
Look,

252
00:16:37,500 --> 00:16:38,450
what you think is

253
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,690
survival of mankind in the future.

254
00:16:40,530 --> 00:16:41,770
Truly very noble.

255
00:16:44,650 --> 00:16:46,130
The police eradicate evil and spread goodness,

256
00:16:46,380 --> 00:16:47,570
that's just truly glorious.

257
00:16:48,820 --> 00:16:50,090
Thank you, thank you.

258
00:16:55,420 --> 00:16:57,090
Mr. Feng is a busy person,

259
00:16:57,620 --> 00:16:58,420
What if...

260
00:16:58,420 --> 00:16:59,530
I'll say goodbye first.

261
00:16:59,770 --> 00:17:00,570
Sorry,

262
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:01,980
I have a meeting soon.

263
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:03,740
Then, I'm not holding you back any longer.

264
00:17:07,290 --> 00:17:08,020
I won't deliver.

265
00:17:42,170 --> 00:17:42,810
Inspector.

266
00:17:51,410 --> 00:17:51,930
Why?

267
00:17:51,930 --> 00:17:52,810
Did you find anything?

268
00:18:00,690 --> 00:18:01,330
Don't move.

269
00:18:09,330 --> 00:18:11,210
Are... are my hands nice to touch?

270
00:18:11,540 --> 00:18:13,290
What feels so energetic?

271
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:14,050
Big fist.

272
00:18:15,450 --> 00:18:16,090
Base.

273
00:18:18,050 --> 00:18:18,810
Give you one task.

274
00:18:18,810 --> 00:18:19,450
You just say it.

275
00:18:19,450 --> 00:18:20,380
In March,

276
00:18:20,380 --> 00:18:21,860
The Feng Group held a

277
00:18:21,860 --> 00:18:22,980
press conference at the Convention Center,

278
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:24,740
related to new energy vehicles.

279
00:18:24,900 --> 00:18:25,860
At that time, Feng Xiaosheng

280
00:18:25,860 --> 00:18:27,450
make a speech at a conference.

281
00:18:28,140 --> 00:18:29,140
You find a way to

282
00:18:29,930 --> 00:18:32,170
get back the full video of his speech.

283
00:18:32,660 --> 00:18:33,330
Good.

284
00:18:33,980 --> 00:18:34,740
Let's go.

285
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:35,450
Ayo.

286
00:18:51,410 --> 00:18:52,090
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

287
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:53,290
It's ready.

288
00:18:54,740 --> 00:18:55,410
Get started.

289
00:18:57,980 --> 00:18:58,450
(Furthermore,)

290
00:18:58,540 --> 00:19:00,210
(Finally arrived at the most important event.)

291
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:02,050
(Next, let's welcome)

292
00:19:02,170 --> 00:19:02,980
(the person who always)

293
00:19:02,980 --> 00:19:04,380
(brings us to)

294
00:19:04,380 --> 00:19:05,450
(stepping forward in the new energy field,)

295
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,140
(Ketua Direksi, Feng Xiaosheng!)

296
00:19:20,140 --> 00:19:21,740
(I've had dreams before,)

297
00:19:22,810 --> 00:19:24,140
(I dream in the future,)

298
00:19:24,740 --> 00:19:26,290
(artificial intelligence can bring)

299
00:19:26,290 --> 00:19:27,620
(more convenience for our lives.)

300
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,660
(Materials are no longer rare.)

301
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:31,210
(No war.)

302
00:19:32,210 --> 00:19:32,900
(No disease.)

303
00:19:33,860 --> 00:19:34,740
(Humans are united.)

304
00:20:34,410 --> 00:20:34,860
Sis Wu.

305
00:20:35,090 --> 00:20:35,740
Try kissing me,

306
00:20:36,050 --> 00:20:37,620
This is my family's secret recipe.

307
00:20:37,740 --> 00:20:38,660
During the Qing dynasty,

308
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,140
spread out from inside the palace.

309
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,450
There are more than 50 types of Chinese herbal medicine.

310
00:20:44,330 --> 00:20:45,450
The aroma is not bad.

311
00:20:45,810 --> 00:20:46,410
You taste it.

312
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:47,740
Give me advice.

313
00:20:47,930 --> 00:20:48,740
That...

314
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:53,330
regarding money matters,

315
00:20:54,330 --> 00:20:55,860
give me a few more days.

316
00:20:58,570 --> 00:20:59,540
Please, Kak Wu.

317
00:21:02,660 --> 00:21:03,660
Three days.

318
00:21:03,930 --> 00:21:04,980
Three days later,

319
00:21:05,290 --> 00:21:06,330
debt and interest

320
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,620
can't be less than a cent.

321
00:21:08,740 --> 00:21:09,210
I've remembered.

322
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:10,210
Fine.

323
00:21:10,210 --> 00:21:11,810
Thank you, Sis Wu.

324
00:21:13,930 --> 00:21:14,660
Sis Wu.

325
00:21:14,860 --> 00:21:15,620
Chicken.

326
00:21:15,620 --> 00:21:16,540
Just put it in the back.

327
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:34,690
- Yours. - Sis Qiang.

328
00:21:34,690 --> 00:21:35,570
No need, no need.

329
00:21:38,210 --> 00:21:39,380
For you, take it.

330
00:21:39,980 --> 00:21:41,410
If it's not like this then you won't be rich.

331
00:21:41,410 --> 00:21:42,170
Thank you, Sis.

332
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,290
Don't think that your Brother Qiang is stingy enough.

333
00:21:44,540 --> 00:21:45,380
I'm different from you.

334
00:21:45,380 --> 00:21:46,330
I have to support my family.

335
00:21:47,170 --> 00:21:47,930
Of course.

336
00:21:54,290 --> 00:21:55,810
Still living on the roof?

337
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:56,690
Of.

338
00:21:56,810 --> 00:21:58,090
I'm used to living here.

339
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,290
I'm too lazy to move.

340
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,570
Next time if there is a chance,

341
00:22:01,570 --> 00:22:03,330
invite your friends out.

342
00:22:03,330 --> 00:22:04,810
We sit together

343
00:22:04,810 --> 00:22:05,900
and get to know each other.

344
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:07,980
I thank you on their behalf.

345
00:22:08,540 --> 00:22:09,570
However, my friends,

346
00:22:09,570 --> 00:22:10,860
they are all very nice,

347
00:22:10,860 --> 00:22:12,540
it's just that their level is less respected.

348
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,780
(Food order)

349
00:22:20,810 --> 00:22:21,410
Kak Qiang.

350
00:22:22,210 --> 00:22:23,290
Now if you're not busy,

351
00:22:23,290 --> 00:22:24,540
I want to accept one order.

352
00:22:25,570 --> 00:22:26,170
Go away.

353
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,620
Thank you, Sis Qiang.

354
00:22:28,660 --> 00:22:29,930
Brother two, how is the food?

355
00:22:29,930 --> 00:22:31,290
There are more than 50 Chinese herbal medicines.

356
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,410
Go away, go away.

357
00:22:32,410 --> 00:22:33,410
Then, I'll go first.

358
00:22:33,410 --> 00:22:34,330
Eat slowly.

359
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:35,330
I'm leaving, Brother Qiang.

360
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:13,690
Old friend,

361
00:23:14,140 --> 00:23:15,020
I came to see you.

362
00:23:15,020 --> 00:23:16,980
(Zhan Ruijun; Hero's Grave)

363
00:23:41,570 --> 00:23:42,450
Have arrived?

364
00:23:45,860 --> 00:23:47,170
Look at the place you chose.

365
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,930
Is this place no good?

366
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:50,860
Remote.

367
00:23:51,780 --> 00:23:52,690
Especially at night,

368
00:23:52,690 --> 00:23:53,410
there's no one here.

369
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:54,140
Aman.

370
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:55,900
Safe is safe.

371
00:23:55,900 --> 00:23:56,810
This is too scary.

372
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:58,260
The hairs on my neck are getting goosebumps.

373
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,980
This is a police cemetery.

374
00:24:01,090 --> 00:24:01,980
Who is buried here

375
00:24:02,540 --> 00:24:03,980
all of them are loyal souls.

376
00:24:04,660 --> 00:24:05,450
When they were alive,

377
00:24:06,170 --> 00:24:07,660
they are not afraid of cruel villains.

378
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,900
Now when buried here,

379
00:24:10,170 --> 00:24:12,260
Demons and ghosts also don't dare to approach.

380
00:24:15,780 --> 00:24:16,980
I'll introduce you.

381
00:24:19,290 --> 00:24:19,980
This person.

382
00:24:20,980 --> 00:24:21,980
On the way to work,

383
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,620
he meets armed criminals.

384
00:24:24,810 --> 00:24:25,780
To protect pedestrians,

385
00:24:25,930 --> 00:24:26,900
he received three stab wounds.

386
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:28,780
However, before falling,

387
00:24:29,210 --> 00:24:30,740
he even still chased for more than 40 meters.

388
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:35,050
This person.

389
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:38,620
He died by sacrificing himself while he was pregnant

390
00:24:38,620 --> 00:24:39,210
chasing fugitives.

391
00:24:39,260 --> 00:24:40,540
Stabbed 21 times.

392
00:24:41,690 --> 00:24:42,810
Even until death,

393
00:24:43,500 --> 00:24:44,740
he held tight

394
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:46,020
the suspect's wrist.

395
00:24:47,540 --> 00:24:49,090
This is the person I know best,

396
00:24:49,860 --> 00:24:51,090
he is my classmate.

397
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:51,800
(Zhan Ruijun; Hero's Grave)

398
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:53,500
We graduated from the police academy together.

399
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:55,140
Work together.

400
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,050
Solve cases together.

401
00:24:57,500 --> 00:24:58,660
Catch criminals together.

402
00:25:00,500 --> 00:25:01,930
We promised before,

403
00:25:02,930 --> 00:25:04,380
when we retire,

404
00:25:05,780 --> 00:25:07,660
we will drink together while holding our grandchildren.

405
00:25:09,930 --> 00:25:11,620
However, I can't wait for that day anymore.

406
00:25:14,260 --> 00:25:15,170
Wu.

407
00:25:16,330 --> 00:25:17,290
Actually we...

408
00:25:17,900 --> 00:25:19,450
since wearing this police uniform,

409
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:21,410
already know very clearly

410
00:25:21,410 --> 00:25:22,780
the dangers we will face.

411
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:25,860
There are so many police officers

412
00:25:26,090 --> 00:25:27,740
who died sacrificing themselves while working every year.

413
00:25:29,740 --> 00:25:31,290
Maybe the next one will be me.

414
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:33,760
What-what.

415
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:35,140
Why do you say sentences like that?

416
00:25:35,140 --> 00:25:35,740
Quickly follow me, come on.

417
00:25:36,050 --> 00:25:36,740
What-what. Quick.

418
00:25:37,980 --> 00:25:39,690
You're young, but you believe in superstition.

419
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:40,740
Nope.

420
00:25:44,380 --> 00:25:45,330
Hello, Uncle Zhan.

421
00:25:45,860 --> 00:25:46,780
My name is Meng Hui.

422
00:25:48,090 --> 00:25:49,570
You can call me Wu.

423
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:51,780
I salute you.

424
00:25:58,810 --> 00:25:59,620
Wu.

425
00:26:00,980 --> 00:26:02,090
Go talk there.

426
00:26:04,210 --> 00:26:04,980
Goodbye.

427
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,570
Would you like a piece?

428
00:26:23,140 --> 00:26:24,740
I remember you don't smoke.

429
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:27,810
I only learned about it recently.

430
00:26:29,980 --> 00:26:31,290
While you still can't,

431
00:26:31,620 --> 00:26:32,620
hurry up stop

432
00:26:33,810 --> 00:26:34,410
No, you too

433
00:26:34,410 --> 00:26:35,860
too critical, right?

434
00:26:36,380 --> 00:26:37,900
I follow those people every day,

435
00:26:38,170 --> 00:26:39,290
I'm also helpless.

436
00:26:39,930 --> 00:26:40,450
Wu.

437
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:42,020
You are different from them.

438
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:45,260
Try saying,

439
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:46,170
which one is different?

440
00:26:47,380 --> 00:26:48,290
Here it's different.

441
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:53,330
You have more conscience than them.

442
00:26:53,330 --> 00:26:54,980
You have a greater sense of justice than them.

443
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:56,210
You are more sincere than them.

444
00:26:58,290 --> 00:27:00,020
You have your own limits when doing something.

445
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,780
Wu.

446
00:27:04,050 --> 00:27:05,450
Even though you're not a cop,

447
00:27:06,410 --> 00:27:07,140
But

448
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:09,170
the information you helped us get

449
00:27:09,170 --> 00:27:10,900
very, very, very important.

450
00:27:11,930 --> 00:27:13,330
Besides, the dangers you face

451
00:27:13,780 --> 00:27:15,410
no less than the police.

452
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:17,260
So, today,

453
00:27:17,260 --> 00:27:18,020
here,

454
00:27:18,660 --> 00:27:19,930
I represent my colleagues

455
00:27:20,620 --> 00:27:21,500
and also myself,

456
00:27:22,330 --> 00:27:24,020
show you our respect.

457
00:27:26,290 --> 00:27:26,740
Uncle.

458
00:27:26,930 --> 00:27:27,380
Don't, don't, don't.

459
00:27:27,380 --> 00:27:28,860
This is too much, too much.

460
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,050
Take it down, take it down.

461
00:27:30,500 --> 00:27:30,930
Wu.

462
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:32,290
About your parents' problems.

463
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:34,050
There has been some clarity.

464
00:27:34,090 --> 00:27:34,930
I have a colleague

465
00:27:35,290 --> 00:27:36,930
who went on duty to Tai'an, Shandong.

466
00:27:37,450 --> 00:27:38,690
I asked him to look

467
00:27:39,330 --> 00:27:41,290
human trafficking eradication office there.

468
00:27:41,930 --> 00:27:43,090
They are very enthusiastic.

469
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,210
Really?

470
00:27:44,210 --> 00:27:46,330
However, now it is still not clearly investigated.

471
00:27:47,210 --> 00:27:48,410
Don't rush now.

472
00:27:49,090 --> 00:27:49,660
That's the case

473
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,810
investigated clearly,

474
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,450
I'll tell you straight away.

475
00:27:56,900 --> 00:27:57,570
Wu.

476
00:27:57,620 --> 00:27:58,570
Wu, wake up.

477
00:27:58,620 --> 00:27:59,020
Nope.

478
00:27:59,140 --> 00:27:59,660
Wu, what are you doing?

479
00:27:59,660 --> 00:28:00,570
Wake up.

480
00:28:00,690 --> 00:28:01,930
Uncle, you listen to me.

481
00:28:02,410 --> 00:28:03,330
If you can really find it

482
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:04,330
my real parents...

483
00:28:05,810 --> 00:28:06,780
You really are

484
00:28:06,780 --> 00:28:07,930
the biggest savior in my life.

485
00:28:08,210 --> 00:28:09,140
Wu,

486
00:28:09,810 --> 00:28:11,540
I really understand your feelings.

487
00:28:11,740 --> 00:28:12,810
Wake up, wake up.

488
00:28:14,540 --> 00:28:15,260
I also want to tell you

489
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:16,170
said my heart.

490
00:28:16,540 --> 00:28:18,210
Finding your biological parents for you,

491
00:28:18,210 --> 00:28:18,980
it's a task

492
00:28:18,980 --> 00:28:20,090
we are the police.

493
00:28:20,540 --> 00:28:21,690
This is an official duty.

494
00:28:22,660 --> 00:28:23,660
However, now,

495
00:28:24,330 --> 00:28:25,260
I also think of it as

496
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,660
personal business I have to do.

497
00:28:27,290 --> 00:28:27,860
Also consider as

498
00:28:27,860 --> 00:28:29,290
I have to do my own problems.

499
00:28:30,210 --> 00:28:31,210
Just calm down.

500
00:28:32,540 --> 00:28:33,170
Good.

501
00:28:35,620 --> 00:28:36,740
Thank you, Uncle.

502
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:53,000
(Mysterious Person)

503
00:28:58,210 --> 00:28:59,170
Say it.

504
00:28:59,210 --> 00:29:00,020
Chen Jinyan.

505
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,500
Officer Chen.

506
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:11,290
This... this problem...

507
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,170
it seems too big.

508
00:29:13,690 --> 00:29:15,660
Was Brother Jie's death a trivial matter?

509
00:29:17,210 --> 00:29:18,660
I know everything you do.

510
00:29:19,290 --> 00:29:20,740
You can consider it yourself.

511
00:29:24,050 --> 00:29:24,860
Surface.

512
00:29:25,020 --> 00:29:26,660
If you like this, then eat more.

513
00:29:26,740 --> 00:29:27,140
Good.

514
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:28,860
Surface.

515
00:29:29,380 --> 00:29:30,290
When

516
00:29:30,290 --> 00:29:31,540
your parents have time,

517
00:29:31,540 --> 00:29:32,570
can they come here?

518
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:34,450
Our family

519
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:35,980
can sit together to chat.

520
00:29:37,290 --> 00:29:37,930
They are

521
00:29:37,930 --> 00:29:38,900
keep saying want

522
00:29:38,900 --> 00:29:40,090
go home to meet Uncle and Aunt.

523
00:29:40,210 --> 00:29:42,540
It's just that they currently have something to do, so they can't go.

524
00:29:42,660 --> 00:29:43,450
However, next month

525
00:29:43,450 --> 00:29:44,330
it should be possible.

526
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:45,410
In that case, okay.

527
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:46,290
Next month

528
00:29:46,290 --> 00:29:47,500
I have business.

529
00:29:48,780 --> 00:29:49,410
Indeed

530
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,020
next month

531
00:29:50,020 --> 00:29:51,410
what can you do?

532
00:29:52,740 --> 00:29:54,210
Trips arranged by the office.

533
00:29:54,210 --> 00:29:55,900
He said he had been preparing for several months.

534
00:29:57,140 --> 00:29:58,570
Your workplace,

535
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,090
funds are very limited,

536
00:30:00,090 --> 00:30:01,380
still going on trips?

537
00:30:02,020 --> 00:30:03,620
Go where? Going to the countryside?

538
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:05,140
Seeing chickens, ducks,

539
00:30:05,140 --> 00:30:06,450
geese and such.

540
00:30:06,740 --> 00:30:07,780
I see it's fine if you don't go.

541
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:08,330
I tell you,

542
00:30:08,570 --> 00:30:09,540
no matter where it goes,

543
00:30:09,540 --> 00:30:10,980
it's a joint event,

544
00:30:10,980 --> 00:30:12,380
should have gone participate.

545
00:30:13,500 --> 00:30:13,860
I heard,

546
00:30:13,860 --> 00:30:14,930
this time there is an advantage,

547
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,020
can bring family members.

548
00:30:16,380 --> 00:30:17,860
You can go with me.

549
00:30:18,620 --> 00:30:19,780
You have to go.

550
00:30:19,860 --> 00:30:21,260
Don't go, don't go, don't go.

551
00:30:23,500 --> 00:30:26,050
(Barbecue) Cheers, toast, cheers!

552
00:30:26,050 --> 00:30:27,620
One glass, one glass.

553
00:30:27,660 --> 00:30:29,570
One and a half glasses, one and a half glasses!

554
00:30:30,020 --> 00:30:30,290
Come on, come on.

555
00:30:30,290 --> 00:30:31,020
Let's drink together.

556
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:31,540
(There's a new order) You guys first.

557
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,170
(There's a new order) We're in this together.

558
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,540
Come on, come on, come on.

559
00:30:32,540 --> 00:30:32,780
You drink first.

560
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,300
(Beef Noodles to Donghu Yuyuan) You drink first, you drink first.

561
00:30:34,570 --> 00:30:35,540
It's agreed, finish it in one sip.

562
00:30:35,540 --> 00:30:36,860
You actually took three or four sips.

563
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:37,570
Come on, come on, come on.

564
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,660
Another glass!

565
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:39,620
Come on, cheers!

566
00:30:39,620 --> 00:30:40,570
Leng Tou, drink a glass!

567
00:30:40,570 --> 00:30:41,410
Come on, cheers!

568
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:42,020
Cheers!

569
00:30:42,570 --> 00:30:42,930
Come on, come on, come on.

570
00:30:42,930 --> 00:30:43,780
Cheers, cheers, cheers!

571
00:30:43,780 --> 00:30:44,930
Fine.

572
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,500
Come on, come on, come on!

573
00:30:49,660 --> 00:30:50,210
Bump!

574
00:30:50,210 --> 00:30:50,780
Ayo.

575
00:30:50,930 --> 00:30:51,660
Cheers!

576
00:30:51,660 --> 00:30:52,620
Come on, come on, come on, cheers.

577
00:30:56,170 --> 00:30:56,810
Kak Qiang.

578
00:30:57,450 --> 00:30:59,500
Lao Ba's money has been obtained.

579
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:03,930
Go away.

580
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:04,740
Good.

581
00:31:06,330 --> 00:31:08,540
Wu, don't run away.

582
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:10,170
Go to the toilet.

583
00:31:10,170 --> 00:31:10,620
You...

584
00:31:10,620 --> 00:31:12,210
Why are you always watching him?

585
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:13,500
Come on, I'll drink with you.

586
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:14,540
How many glasses can you drink?

587
00:31:15,450 --> 00:31:17,090
Drink, drink!

588
00:31:17,090 --> 00:31:17,540
Cheers!

589
00:31:17,540 --> 00:31:18,290
No need to worry?

590
00:32:11,090 --> 00:32:11,570
Halo.

591
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:12,930
A pack of cigarettes.

592
00:32:17,740 --> 00:32:18,380
Thank You.

593
00:32:31,930 --> 00:32:32,860
It's all here.

594
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:35,380
Sis Wu, try to count.

595
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:42,810
This is cigarette money.

596
00:32:46,210 --> 00:32:47,020
OK, I understand.

597
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:49,930
Be careful, Sis Wu.

598
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:18,450
Fast...

599
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,450
Run.

600
00:34:22,610 --> 00:34:23,450
Run.

601
00:36:05,100 --> 00:36:06,540
Four sixes.

602
00:36:06,820 --> 00:36:08,580
Seven nines.

603
00:36:08,580 --> 00:36:12,820
Dreams, can't remember in dreams.

604
00:36:13,820 --> 00:36:14,820
Hey, who is this?

605
00:36:18,130 --> 00:36:19,060
How Dao Jian?

606
00:36:19,780 --> 00:36:20,210
Come on, come on, come on.

607
00:36:20,210 --> 00:36:21,020
Drink, drink!

608
00:36:21,020 --> 00:36:21,980
Come on, come on, come on, have a glass.

609
00:36:21,980 --> 00:36:23,300
Sit, sit, sit.

610
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:24,740
You're drinking, right?

611
00:36:29,690 --> 00:36:31,300
Why not see Wu?

612
00:36:31,300 --> 00:36:33,130
Wu went to the toilet.

613
00:36:34,820 --> 00:36:36,450
Is there a problem?

614
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:52,740
How Dao Jian?

615
00:36:54,170 --> 00:36:55,300
No, why did you come?

616
00:36:56,580 --> 00:36:57,820
Why, Brother Qiang?

617
00:36:59,690 --> 00:37:00,820
Tonight you

618
00:37:00,820 --> 00:37:02,020
always here?

619
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:03,820
Of.

620
00:37:05,300 --> 00:37:06,130
Never leave?

621
00:37:07,130 --> 00:37:08,060
No.

622
00:37:08,820 --> 00:37:09,980
Why?

623
00:37:11,170 --> 00:37:12,780
Bukan, Dao Jian.

624
00:37:12,780 --> 00:37:13,780
What do you mean?

625
00:37:13,780 --> 00:37:14,500
Are you interrogating?

626
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:15,820
Diam!

627
00:37:19,060 --> 00:37:19,930
I was asking Wu.

628
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:20,980
Don't.

629
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:21,980
That...

630
00:37:26,260 --> 00:37:26,930
No need to ask him,

631
00:37:26,930 --> 00:37:28,060
just ask me.

632
00:37:28,300 --> 00:37:29,540
Wu tonight

633
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,930
always with me.

634
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:32,610
After this kid drank a bottle of beer,

635
00:37:32,610 --> 00:37:33,300
he went to the toilet once.

636
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:34,650
All night he went to the toilet

637
00:37:35,410 --> 00:37:37,020
eight times.

638
00:37:37,300 --> 00:37:38,170
No, Dao Jian, you...

639
00:37:38,820 --> 00:37:39,980
where did you come from suddenly

640
00:37:39,980 --> 00:37:40,820
appear?

641
00:37:42,410 --> 00:37:42,980
Okay.

642
00:37:43,300 --> 00:37:44,580
Continue drinking.

643
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:11,170
Sweet and sour chicken.

644
00:38:11,300 --> 00:38:12,100
Come on, cheers!

645
00:38:12,100 --> 00:38:13,580
Come on, cheers.

646
00:38:13,580 --> 00:38:14,300
Ayo.

647
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:15,820
Wu.

648
00:38:17,450 --> 00:38:18,610
Raise your feet.

649
00:38:27,300 --> 00:38:28,300
What?

650
00:38:28,410 --> 00:38:30,450
I want you to lift your feet!

651
00:38:30,650 --> 00:38:31,820
Are you crazy?

652
00:39:11,060 --> 00:39:12,300
Dao Jian saw you?

653
00:39:18,020 --> 00:39:18,820
No.

654
00:39:26,450 --> 00:39:27,820
What really happened?

655
00:39:31,500 --> 00:39:32,540
Don't know.

656
00:39:32,820 --> 00:39:33,820
Aren't you fooling me?

657
00:39:34,060 --> 00:39:35,850
Why does Dao Jian check the soles of your shoes?

658
00:39:38,980 --> 00:39:40,300
Are these your shoes?

659
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,060
Don't think I'm stupid.

660
00:39:42,450 --> 00:39:43,540
Where are your own shoes?

661
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:44,580
When you came today,

662
00:39:44,580 --> 00:39:45,650
are you wearing these shoes?

663
00:40:11,260 --> 00:40:12,060
Why?

664
00:40:12,650 --> 00:40:14,130
Even want to hide it from me too?

665
00:40:16,170 --> 00:40:17,980
I saw Dao Jian kill someone.

666
00:40:21,930 --> 00:40:22,980
Killing?

667
00:40:23,690 --> 00:40:24,820
Killing who?

668
00:40:28,610 --> 00:40:29,610
Don't know.

669
00:40:37,130 --> 00:40:38,820
After I asked Zhang Laoba for money,

670
00:40:40,260 --> 00:40:41,980
I saw her and a man

671
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:43,980
at the mouth of the alley.

672
00:40:47,210 --> 00:40:49,300
I thought about taking shelter first.

673
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:51,170
It's raining so hard,

674
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,820
in the middle of the night.

675
00:40:53,690 --> 00:40:55,020
Can take shelter anywhere,

676
00:40:56,610 --> 00:40:58,300
instead taking shelter in a place where it shouldn't be.

677
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:00,170
So?

678
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:01,780
So...

679
00:41:10,450 --> 00:41:12,210
then, I heard a crash.

680
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,410
Seeing Dao Jian hit him.

681
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,780
Hit that person to death.

682
00:41:36,820 --> 00:41:39,060
I saw him kill someone with my own eyes.

683
00:41:52,690 --> 00:41:53,690
What a coward you are!

684
00:41:54,450 --> 00:41:55,690
Why are you such a coward?

685
00:41:57,170 --> 00:41:58,300
What are you crying about?

686
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,300
Kak Qiang.

687
00:42:00,170 --> 00:42:01,410
Let's report it to the police.

688
00:42:01,740 --> 00:42:02,450
I'm begging you.

689
00:42:02,450 --> 00:42:03,060
I'm scared.

690
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:04,610
Just report it to the police, Brother Qiang.

691
00:42:05,100 --> 00:42:06,020
Cih.

692
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:09,930
You're looking for trouble, aren't you?

693
00:42:10,820 --> 00:42:11,820
Are you bored of life?

694
00:42:12,020 --> 00:42:12,930
If you report to the police,

695
00:42:12,930 --> 00:42:14,540
later someone will kill you.

696
00:42:14,540 --> 00:42:15,740
Do you believe it or not?

697
00:42:19,580 --> 00:42:20,610
Do you believe it or not?

698
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:29,820
Wu.

699
00:42:30,130 --> 00:42:31,690
Now go out for a drink.

700
00:42:32,650 --> 00:42:33,300
After drinking,

701
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:34,820
slept for three days and three nights.

702
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:36,130
Don't say anything.

703
00:42:36,170 --> 00:42:36,820
Don't ask anything.

704
00:42:36,930 --> 00:42:37,690
Don't care about anything.

705
00:42:37,820 --> 00:42:38,780
Do you understand?

706
00:42:40,690 --> 00:42:42,300
He kills people, Sis Qiang.

707
00:42:42,820 --> 00:42:44,450
Be tough.

708
00:42:44,580 --> 00:42:45,500
Be tough!

709
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:47,540
I don't want to do it anymore.

710
00:42:48,300 --> 00:42:49,130
Sis.

711
00:42:50,740 --> 00:42:52,100
He kills people.

712
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:53,100
Wu.

713
00:42:53,540 --> 00:42:54,610
Wu!

714
00:42:55,300 --> 00:42:56,740
You have to listen to Big Brother now.

715
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:57,740
Listen Big Brother.

716
00:42:59,890 --> 00:43:01,210
Quickly wipe clean

717
00:43:01,410 --> 00:43:02,740
tears on your face.

718
00:43:04,340 --> 00:43:05,100
Wipe until clean!

719
00:43:06,100 --> 00:43:07,930
Don't let other people see it.

720
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,370
I'm scared.

721
00:43:19,580 --> 00:43:20,930
