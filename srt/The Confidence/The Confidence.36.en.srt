00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 36=

3
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,460
Have you found it?

4
00:02:25,900 --> 00:02:27,300
I've searched several places,

5
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:29,780
and to his house too,

6
00:02:30,710 --> 00:02:31,460
still nothing.

7
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:35,140
People at the office say,

8
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:37,260
when Yuan Fenfang left,

9
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:38,620
he specifically advised that

10
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:41,140
he will be back at 15.00,

11
00:02:42,300 --> 00:02:43,500
but he didn't appear at all.

12
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:48,340
There's... there's more...

13
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,340
What else?

14
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:53,020
People at the office say,

15
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:55,060
lately,

16
00:02:55,940 --> 00:02:58,140
Yuan Fenfang and Meng Hui from the business unit

17
00:02:58,780 --> 00:02:59,700
looks pretty close.

18
00:03:03,980 --> 00:03:05,500
Meng...Meng Hui?

19
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:09,340
He is a...

20
00:03:11,260 --> 00:03:12,620
that person named Wu.

21
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:21,300
Unexpected.

22
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:25,900
It's been maintained for so long,

23
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,420
after meeting the male dog,

24
00:03:34,540 --> 00:03:36,900
even forgot to thank you.

25
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,600
(Incoming Call; Sheng)

26
00:04:10,820 --> 00:04:11,380
Halo.

27
00:04:15,580 --> 00:04:16,180
Say,

28
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:18,460
What do you want?

29
00:04:29,020 --> 00:04:29,500
Good.

30
00:04:43,420 --> 00:04:44,340
Animal!

31
00:04:57,820 --> 00:04:58,500
Go away

32
00:04:59,740 --> 00:05:03,060
call Meng here.

33
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:10,820
Go there!

34
00:06:00,380 --> 00:06:01,500
I hear your voice,

35
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,340
You're out in the open, right?

36
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:06,740
Keep guessing.

37
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:16,980
Cliff?

38
00:06:19,260 --> 00:06:21,500
You set the meeting place on a cliff by the sea,

39
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:26,020
the place where Shen Shijie fell from the cliff.

40
00:06:30,420 --> 00:06:31,430
My guess was right, right?

41
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,300
Sometimes you're quite scary,

42
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,420
you understand me very well.

43
00:06:39,260 --> 00:06:41,260
You men are really hard to serve.

44
00:06:42,100 --> 00:06:43,620
It's a bit stupid, you guys will be annoyed.

45
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:45,260
Rather clever, you guys are even scared.

46
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:46,940
How about like this,

47
00:06:47,300 --> 00:06:48,980
I will try to pretend to be stupid in the future.

48
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,060
Remember,

49
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:54,180
must be in US dollars,

50
00:06:54,940 --> 00:06:56,500
I can't take it out if it's yuan.

51
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:57,860
Understand.

52
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:08,980
Big Boss,

53
00:09:09,500 --> 00:09:10,780
the slope here is a bit steep,

54
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,100
your feet...

55
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:15,100
Maybe he did all this on purpose.

56
00:09:16,900 --> 00:09:18,020
Am I that old?

57
00:09:44,140 --> 00:09:45,140
Go ahead, Old Master Feng.

58
00:10:20,100 --> 00:10:21,140
How about this place?

59
00:10:22,580 --> 00:10:23,380
Do you like it?

60
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:29,580
This is the place where you fell off the cliff, right?

61
00:10:31,940 --> 00:10:34,020
This is also where I found my new life.

62
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:40,140
Maybe you don't believe what I say.

63
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:44,540
When you just came back,

64
00:10:46,060 --> 00:10:50,340
I really want to treat you like Sheng.

65
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,820
You're an orphan,

66
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,260
and I don't have children.

67
00:11:01,460 --> 00:11:02,420
If put together,

68
00:11:03,340 --> 00:11:04,700
could be a family.

69
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,340
Besides that,

70
00:11:08,820 --> 00:11:12,220
your face looks like Sheng.

71
00:11:14,260 --> 00:11:15,380
By using his identity,

72
00:11:17,780 --> 00:11:18,460
see you,

73
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:23,700
I felt as if Sheng was still alive.

74
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,420
Don't be emotional anymore,

75
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:32,180
just get straight to the point.

76
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:39,140
Say,

77
00:11:40,700 --> 00:11:41,900
what do you really want?

78
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:48,900
I've left half of it

79
00:12:49,700 --> 00:12:51,580
down payment for Aoxin's car for you,

80
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,540
but you still want more?

81
00:12:54,860 --> 00:12:56,420
Aren't you too greedy?

82
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,340
I'm still far away compared to you.

83
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:01,660
Didn't you say it yourself?

84
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,220
have no children.

85
00:13:03,940 --> 00:13:06,980
So, who else will this money be given to?

86
00:13:10,220 --> 00:13:10,740
Okay,

87
00:13:11,780 --> 00:13:12,580
I'll give you the money.

88
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:14,580
However,

89
00:13:16,020 --> 00:13:20,580
At least you have to wait until the money comes out of the country.

90
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,860
I know you guys have transferred a lot of money out,

91
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:26,830
there is no need for this little.

92
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:37,740
I've been to work and school,

93
00:13:37,780 --> 00:13:38,620
but still haven't found it.

94
00:13:40,060 --> 00:13:42,300
I think it must be at Sheng's house.

95
00:13:42,860 --> 00:13:44,380
I'll take people there now.

96
00:14:02,060 --> 00:14:03,140
If I give you the money,

97
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:05,260
How about you just turn away

98
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:09,540
and instead submit the transaction journal?

99
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,460
Either way,

100
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,460
This time I must be able to find the boy's weakness.

101
00:14:22,660 --> 00:14:24,020
Second uncle brought people home!

102
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,780
You really want to die with me, huh?

103
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:37,940
child,

104
00:14:39,300 --> 00:14:41,060
You are the one who doesn't give room to retreat.

105
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:43,020
It's definitely mutually beneficial,

106
00:14:44,580 --> 00:14:47,940
but instead you push people to a dead end.

107
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,700
Sis!

108
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,580
They are buying time!

109
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,140
old fart,

110
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:06,780
you just wait!

111
00:15:07,780 --> 00:15:08,500
Fast!

112
00:15:10,740 --> 00:15:11,580
Hurry, Sis!

113
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:28,300
(Incoming Call; Feng Xiaosheng)

114
00:15:30,220 --> 00:15:30,780
Halo.

115
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:33,020
Hurry up!

116
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,280
Second uncle brought people home!

117
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:32,480
The door is blocked,

118
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:33,420
I can't go out.

119
00:16:35,080 --> 00:16:36,450
Don't panic, go to the book room first.

120
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:37,700
Good.

121
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:02,700
I've arrived at the book room, but I don't know the password.

122
00:17:02,820 --> 00:17:04,380
The password is 1029.

123
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:05,050
Good.

124
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:15,980
It's open.

125
00:17:26,050 --> 00:17:27,660
I think I saw a shadow of a person.

126
00:17:30,300 --> 00:17:31,140
Quick search.

127
00:17:40,450 --> 00:17:41,890
What if they find out I'm home?

128
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:43,420
Ying, you don't need to panic.

129
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,860
- I will report to the police. - You can't report to the police!

130
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:47,820
Wait for me to come back.

131
00:17:48,060 --> 00:17:49,700
Do you want to come back to clean up my body?

132
00:17:51,540 --> 00:17:52,260
Let's make it like this,

133
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:54,100
at the bottom right of the table there is a board that can be moved,

134
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:55,740
try it yourself.

135
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:30,740
How? Are you out yet?

136
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:34,820
I'm out.

137
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:37,940
What next?

138
00:20:38,400 --> 00:20:39,630
Exit through the north gate of the complex.

139
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,220
I'm going to pick you up now, wait for me.

140
00:20:42,540 --> 00:20:43,140
Good.

141
00:21:44,140 --> 00:21:45,300
Search carefully, yes.

142
00:21:58,780 --> 00:22:00,060
There was clearly a shadow of a person,

143
00:22:00,700 --> 00:22:02,140
but after entering I couldn't find it,

144
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:03,980
very weird.

145
00:22:04,540 --> 00:22:05,580
You stupid!

146
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:07,940
Don't scream!

147
00:22:09,500 --> 00:22:10,300
You won't die.

148
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:16,240
Has the transaction journal been found?

149
00:22:16,620 --> 00:22:17,460
Still not yet.

150
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:19,500
If so, look no further.

151
00:22:20,020 --> 00:22:22,260
Shen Shijie is back, don't run into him.

152
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,140
Exactly if he comes,

153
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:26,100
I will behead him at once!

154
00:22:26,620 --> 00:22:27,860
He's got a gun!

155
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:36,980
Come on, let's disperse quickly.

156
00:22:37,980 --> 00:22:38,820
Are you all deaf?

157
00:22:39,020 --> 00:22:39,780
Let's go quickly!

158
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:40,580
Go, go,

159
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,140
let's go quickly.

160
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,740
Ayo.

161
00:23:07,820 --> 00:23:08,740
Hit him!

162
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:52,180
If you kill me, you won't survive either.

163
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:54,940
Tell Feng Yong,

164
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:56,660
If you want a transaction journal,

165
00:23:57,140 --> 00:23:59,220
send 500 million American dollars to my overseas account tomorrow.

166
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:01,460
I also won't interfere in company affairs anymore.

167
00:24:01,460 --> 00:24:02,940
Have you gone crazy for money?

168
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:12,740
If... there's a problem,

169
00:24:12,740 --> 00:24:14,260
talk... talk carefully.

170
00:24:25,340 --> 00:24:26,140
You're okay, right?

171
00:24:27,300 --> 00:24:28,100
where is he

172
00:24:28,830 --> 00:24:30,380
He stayed home to clean up the mess,

173
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:31,340
and told me to pick you up.

174
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:35,380
He will definitely change all the passwords and lock the doors.

175
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:38,540
Then, is the secret room really behind the bookshelf?

176
00:24:38,540 --> 00:24:39,780
Actually, what's in it?

177
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:41,540
I didn't see clearly,

178
00:24:41,540 --> 00:24:42,460
it was too messed up.

179
00:24:42,620 --> 00:24:43,860
I haven't had a chance to see it yet.

180
00:24:46,860 --> 00:24:48,640
How did he explain today's problem to you?

181
00:24:48,910 --> 00:24:50,820
He said that he was not the real Feng Xiaongsheng,

182
00:24:51,220 --> 00:24:52,900
he was just a puppet invented by Big Boss Feng.

183
00:24:53,780 --> 00:24:55,380
He already confessed to you that he is Shen Shijie?

184
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,140
No, he didn't say that.

185
00:24:58,540 --> 00:24:59,260
I understand.

186
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,740
Let's go.

187
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,380
Ayo.

188
00:25:02,420 --> 00:25:03,060
Wu,

189
00:25:04,340 --> 00:25:06,460
I suggest you don't contact anyone for these two days,

190
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:08,500
he will definitely send people to keep an eye on you.

191
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:11,140
Good.

192
00:25:30,740 --> 00:25:32,260
Fine, I know.

193
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:33,020
Just that.

194
00:25:34,780 --> 00:25:36,220
Don't be separated from me for these few days.

195
00:25:37,100 --> 00:25:39,060
You too be careful, Wu.

196
00:25:39,300 --> 00:25:40,980
They will do anything if pressed.

197
00:25:41,180 --> 00:25:42,140
Don't worry, Sis,

198
00:25:42,260 --> 00:25:43,020
I'm fine.

199
00:25:53,740 --> 00:25:54,780
Useless bastard!

200
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:22,020
In my opinion, just finish him off.

201
00:26:23,420 --> 00:26:25,700
How about your wife's preparations?

202
00:26:27,220 --> 00:26:29,380
Already booked plane tickets for next Thursday.

203
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:32,060
Next Thursday?

204
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,820
There are still five days left.

205
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,220
There won't be time.

206
00:26:39,780 --> 00:26:41,220
There won't be time, right?

207
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:43,820
There won't be time to sell anything in just a few days.

208
00:26:44,300 --> 00:26:45,820
We can't wait until next Thursday.

209
00:26:46,220 --> 00:26:46,900
Can't?

210
00:26:48,300 --> 00:26:49,420
Need more early?

211
00:26:51,220 --> 00:26:52,300
Go find Lu Er.

212
00:26:53,460 --> 00:26:55,580
It's already like this, we're still smuggling goods out?

213
00:26:56,860 --> 00:26:59,060
This time, we're not just smuggling goods,

214
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:02,860
but we also have to go.

215
00:27:29,620 --> 00:27:31,300
Have you been sleeping here since you came back?

216
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:32,220
Correct.

217
00:27:34,900 --> 00:27:35,660
Why?

218
00:27:40,100 --> 00:27:40,860
Why?

219
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,020
Because I'm scared,

220
00:27:47,980 --> 00:27:49,140
afraid of being caught by the police,

221
00:27:51,260 --> 00:27:52,220
fear of people's retaliation.

222
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,660
Are you always like this?

223
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:12,380
Sit down.

224
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,660
Are you the one renting this house?

225
00:28:25,260 --> 00:28:26,460
Why are you asking so many questions today?

226
00:28:37,660 --> 00:28:40,660
You've seen the things in the cupboard, right?

227
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:46,700
Of.

228
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,900
Then, you already know all my secrets.

229
00:28:55,260 --> 00:28:56,020
So?

230
00:28:58,220 --> 00:28:59,540
I will never let you go again.

231
00:29:02,500 --> 00:29:04,620
If I don't know all your secrets,

232
00:29:06,740 --> 00:29:07,700
will you let me go?

233
00:29:11,540 --> 00:29:12,340
Won't.

234
00:29:16,580 --> 00:29:17,540
That's good then.

235
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:32,780
Are you taking herbal medicine?

236
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,620
I want to drink water.

237
00:30:06,460 --> 00:30:07,660
What are you sick with?

238
00:30:11,660 --> 00:30:13,020
Heart and liver are hot,

239
00:30:13,060 --> 00:30:14,540
not sleeping well at night.

240
00:30:16,960 --> 00:30:18,760
It is best to treat immediately if there is an illness,

241
00:30:18,980 --> 00:30:19,820
don't delay.

242
00:30:50,460 --> 00:30:51,540
What does that mean?

243
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,140
Still don't want to see me?

244
00:31:10,380 --> 00:31:11,060
Lu Er,

245
00:31:11,340 --> 00:31:13,700
do you think you can hide for the rest of your life

246
00:31:13,700 --> 00:31:15,260
by making yourself fat?

247
00:31:18,500 --> 00:31:20,140
If it weren't for my brother to protect you,

248
00:31:20,140 --> 00:31:21,500
You've died many times before.

249
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:23,300
Are you still acting smart with me?

250
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:30,780
Don't you want to make money and escape?

251
00:31:31,300 --> 00:31:32,620
Tell me, how much money do you need?

252
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:37,180
Second Brother, I really don't want to do it anymore.

253
00:31:37,180 --> 00:31:37,900
Two million.

254
00:31:38,740 --> 00:31:39,820
It's not a question of money.

255
00:31:39,940 --> 00:31:40,780
Four million.

256
00:31:43,300 --> 00:31:44,180
Too dangerous.

257
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,740
That time has taken its toll,

258
00:31:47,420 --> 00:31:48,940
will the police just keep quiet?

259
00:31:51,100 --> 00:31:51,860
Ten million.

260
00:31:55,620 --> 00:31:56,540
Ten million?

261
00:31:57,900 --> 00:31:58,700
Get ready,

262
00:31:59,140 --> 00:31:59,980
leaving the day after tomorrow.

263
00:32:01,300 --> 00:32:02,060
Lusa?

264
00:32:02,780 --> 00:32:03,620
No, no,

265
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:05,140
it won't be possible.

266
00:32:13,180 --> 00:32:14,100
Leave the day after tomorrow.

267
00:32:18,820 --> 00:32:20,540
Eventually these people will act again.

268
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:23,060
This time, don't let any of them escape.

269
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:33,060
This Feng Ruichi

270
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:36,780
always in contact with Dan Yue, a drug kingpin from abroad.

271
00:32:37,300 --> 00:32:39,220
Money that was smuggled out of the country previously,

272
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:41,260
through Dan Yue's path.

273
00:32:43,140 --> 00:32:46,580
We suspect that the Feng family has a base,

274
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:48,500
and committed money laundering under Dan Yue's protection.

275
00:32:50,540 --> 00:32:53,020
This time, they played this way again.

276
00:32:53,500 --> 00:32:55,180
Feng Ruichi is still abroad now,

277
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:58,500
It should have been to facilitate the Feng brothers' escape.

278
00:33:00,620 --> 00:33:01,300
Kapten Xiao,

279
00:33:02,140 --> 00:33:03,180
report the relationship between

280
00:33:03,180 --> 00:33:06,740
Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie beserta situasi penyelidikannya

281
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:08,100
to Investigation Team Leader Li.

282
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,860
Good.

283
00:33:11,460 --> 00:33:12,260
Two years ago,

284
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:14,380
Feng Xiaosheng was diagnosed with cancer,

285
00:33:14,860 --> 00:33:16,460
but he continued to close this news from the outside world.

286
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:17,940
Until March this year,

287
00:33:18,420 --> 00:33:20,780
with reason for new energy vehicle project survey,

288
00:33:20,780 --> 00:33:21,580
he went alone to Europe,

289
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:24,180
but instead lived in Spain for half a year.

290
00:33:24,660 --> 00:33:25,940
This is all we can investigate.

291
00:33:26,860 --> 00:33:27,940
According to information,

292
00:33:28,380 --> 00:33:30,980
who fell off a cliff and died on March 17, not Shen Shijie.

293
00:33:31,700 --> 00:33:33,980
The original Shen Shijie, having been converted from under the cliff,

294
00:33:34,060 --> 00:33:36,460
he took a cargo ship from Nanzhou to Spain,

295
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:38,300
and arrived in Spain by sea.

296
00:33:38,700 --> 00:33:40,980
Then, met Feng Xiaosheng in a luxurious house,

297
00:33:41,020 --> 00:33:42,460
and underwent plastic surgery.

298
00:33:43,300 --> 00:33:45,260
After going through six months of recovery

299
00:33:45,260 --> 00:33:46,660
and short training,

300
00:33:46,780 --> 00:33:49,260
he returned to Nanzhou using the identity of Feng Xiaosheng,

301
00:33:49,620 --> 00:33:52,060
and became Feng Yong's puppet to control the Feng Group.

302
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,780
If you look at the chronology, everything is correct.

303
00:33:55,540 --> 00:33:58,580
If Shen Shijie pretended to be the current Feng xiaosheng,

304
00:33:58,850 --> 00:34:00,300
So who died before that?

305
00:34:01,500 --> 00:34:02,740
I have sent people to investigate

306
00:34:02,740 --> 00:34:04,820
all the social relations around Feng Xiaosheng.

307
00:34:05,060 --> 00:34:06,220
The research results show,

308
00:34:06,460 --> 00:34:09,580
most likely it was his driver and bodyguard, Zhu Jianhai.

309
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,580
This Zhu Jianhai has worked with the Feng family for eight years.

310
00:34:12,980 --> 00:34:15,140
In March this year, he suddenly fell ill and died.

311
00:34:15,620 --> 00:34:16,620
Very suspicious.

312
00:34:16,830 --> 00:34:18,660
We're getting ready to take his DNA,

313
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:21,700
comparing DNA samples taken from the cave with the remains,

314
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:23,530
endeavor to do so as soon as possible.

315
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,620
If this is true,

316
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,580
that meant Feng Xiaosheng planned this thoroughly.

317
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,370
He knew he wouldn't live much longer,

318
00:34:31,940 --> 00:34:34,140
then look for a replacement to stabilize the situation in the country.

319
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:36,620
Feng Yong accelerated the flight of funds,

320
00:34:37,890 --> 00:34:39,850
Shen Shijie sebagai kambing hitam.

321
00:34:44,940 --> 00:34:45,740
Truly...

322
00:34:46,500 --> 00:34:47,940
would rather give up life than wealth.

323
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:51,100
It's time for us to put things in order at home,

324
00:34:52,540 --> 00:34:54,820
for police abroad, you must contact them immediately.

325
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:57,780
What is the informant's situation now?

326
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,700
Kak Sheng,

327
00:35:09,740 --> 00:35:12,980
do you think Big Boss Feng and second uncle

328
00:35:13,460 --> 00:35:15,380
will you really give us the money as promised?

329
00:35:17,420 --> 00:35:20,140
They finally managed to devour and swallow it.

330
00:35:20,640 --> 00:35:22,520
How could it be that easy to spit it out?

331
00:35:22,780 --> 00:35:23,820
I think so too.

332
00:35:23,900 --> 00:35:25,900
Then, what's the point of giving them three days?

333
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:35,400
(Incoming Call; Lian Damao)

334
00:35:35,580 --> 00:35:36,460
Serve the rice.

335
00:35:37,740 --> 00:35:38,220
Not...

336
00:35:39,980 --> 00:35:40,620
Go away.

337
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,660
Halo.

338
00:35:50,620 --> 00:35:52,340
It's okay, I'll just leave it alone.

339
00:35:55,740 --> 00:35:56,900
Fine, I understand.

340
00:36:03,020 --> 00:36:03,660
Sit down.

341
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:11,020
Who called you?

342
00:36:14,900 --> 00:36:17,340
Apart from giving Lian Lian a necklace worth ten million,

343
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,820
did you also give her a family heirloom bracelet?

344
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,620
I wasn't the one who gave you the bracelet.

345
00:36:31,220 --> 00:36:33,900
He wanted to return it and told me to take it.

346
00:36:40,900 --> 00:36:43,620
It would be better if you yourself took the gift you were given,

347
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,660
what do you think?

348
00:36:49,820 --> 00:36:51,860
Never mind, you just go.

349
00:36:53,420 --> 00:36:54,020
Wu,

350
00:36:54,860 --> 00:36:56,140
Later, accompany your Sis Ke out.

351
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,180
If Lian Lian dares to mess around,

352
00:36:58,420 --> 00:36:59,420
no need to be shy about him.

353
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:01,900
- Come on, sit down and eat. - I understand.

354
00:37:08,380 --> 00:37:08,900
Follow him.

355
00:37:12,540 --> 00:37:13,180
Good.

356
00:37:25,540 --> 00:37:26,900
That guy only followed me for a day.

357
00:37:29,140 --> 00:37:30,900
This morning he no longer followed.

358
00:37:34,660 --> 00:37:35,860
Lian Lian wasn't the one who asked you to meet, right?

359
00:37:55,220 --> 00:37:56,260
It's okay, he's my man.

360
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:57,900
Come on in.

361
00:38:27,780 --> 00:38:28,420
Surface.

362
00:38:28,620 --> 00:38:29,140
Ying Ying.

363
00:38:37,780 --> 00:38:38,620
Doctor Who?

364
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,420
It doesn't matter.

365
00:38:50,540 --> 00:38:52,900
Didn't you two fight?

366
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,420
You are the one arguing.

367
00:39:07,140 --> 00:39:07,900
So,

368
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,900
I am just cannon fodder in the battle

369
00:39:09,900 --> 00:39:11,380
between you and Feng Xiaosheng, right?

370
00:39:13,420 --> 00:39:14,900
Lian Lian, tell the truth,

371
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:18,020
are you in love with Feng Xiaosheng?

372
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:27,540
No.

373
00:39:30,420 --> 00:39:31,820
Then, why are you angry?

374
00:39:32,380 --> 00:39:34,180
Because I hate it when other people think I'm stupid!

375
00:39:38,900 --> 00:39:40,900
On the day of the press conference, Yang Yuze came looking for me.

376
00:39:42,020 --> 00:39:44,220
Were you the one who leaked this to Feng Xiaosheng?

377
00:39:47,660 --> 00:39:49,420
What is your real purpose in doing this?

378
00:39:49,900 --> 00:39:50,740
Very simple.

379
00:39:51,580 --> 00:39:53,900
I want to make sure who is telling the truth and who is lying

380
00:39:53,900 --> 00:39:54,900
between the two of you.

381
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,540
It was actually Feng Xiaosheng who was at fault,

382
00:39:58,620 --> 00:39:59,540
or you're crazy.

383
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,420
Lian Lian, I ask you one last question.

384
00:40:05,900 --> 00:40:07,300
If it wasn't for me who broke it,

385
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:10,900
Are you really going to take advantage of the situation and get engaged to him?

386
00:40:15,020 --> 00:40:16,420
So what if you're engaged?

387
00:40:16,900 --> 00:40:18,140
It's just a formality.

388
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:28,580
Lian Lian,

389
00:40:31,180 --> 00:40:32,740
we've been friends for years.

390
00:40:35,420 --> 00:40:36,660
I've said it all

391
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:39,620
what I have to say and what I can say.

392
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,820
You choose to believe me,

393
00:40:40,820 --> 00:40:42,820
or trust Feng Xiaosheng, that's up to you.

394
00:40:44,900 --> 00:40:46,060
That's all.

395
00:40:48,900 --> 00:40:49,540
Look after yourself.

396
00:40:52,340 --> 00:40:53,100
Ke Ying.

397
00:40:58,540 --> 00:41:00,180
I'll ask you one last question.

398
00:41:01,780 --> 00:41:02,900
Yang Yuze went where?

399
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,340
He went to the provincial capital to investigate who it was

400
00:41:08,340 --> 00:41:09,300
It was Shen Shijie who died.

401
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:12,420
Investigation matters should be handed over to the police.

402
00:41:13,900 --> 00:41:15,220
However, there is no evidence at all.

403
00:41:16,260 --> 00:41:17,620
We can only investigate it first.

404
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:19,950
After finding the clue, then hand it over to the police.

405
00:41:22,300 --> 00:41:23,260
If that's the case, let me help him.

406
00:41:28,380 --> 00:41:29,140
You stupid.

407
00:41:29,700 --> 00:41:31,420
How dare you suspect the relationship between us.

408
00:41:32,060 --> 00:41:33,360
I'll take this into account with you later.

409
00:41:47,580 --> 00:41:48,700
It turns out it was your previous slap

410
00:41:48,700 --> 00:41:50,860
deliberately done for Feng Xiaosheng to see, huh?

411
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:52,180
If not?

412
00:41:52,540 --> 00:41:55,420
How could it be possible that Ke Ying and I's relationship over the past dozen years,

413
00:41:55,420 --> 00:41:56,540
ruined by a jerk?

414
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,140
good acting,

415
00:41:58,260 --> 00:41:59,540
great, great.

416
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,340
What are the results of your investigation?

417
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:06,420
There is no record of Zhu Jianhai's death.

418
00:42:06,860 --> 00:42:08,140
I've looked for him in all the hospitals,

419
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:08,900
still nothing.

420
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:11,260
Not only is there no record at the hospital,

421
00:42:11,860 --> 00:42:14,220
even the crematorium also has no record of Hai's cremation.

422
00:42:14,900 --> 00:42:15,700
It can be said that,

423
00:42:16,180 --> 00:42:17,740
we don't really know who the ashes belong to

424
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,420
which was brought back by Feng Xiaosheng.

425
00:42:20,140 --> 00:42:21,180
Also there is one other possibility,

426
00:42:21,420 --> 00:42:23,900
that he brought home was not ashes at all.

427
00:42:23,900 --> 00:42:24,580
Wait.

428
00:42:26,180 --> 00:42:29,180
Hi, what you mean is Gang's older brother.

429
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,180
Didn't he die a long time ago?

430
00:42:32,220 --> 00:42:33,260
That's right, his older brother Gang.

431
00:42:34,140 --> 00:42:36,700
I suspect that it was Shen Shijie who died from falling off that cliff

432
00:42:37,140 --> 00:42:38,260
actually is Hi.

433
00:42:38,740 --> 00:42:41,900
The severe damage to the corpse's face was also definitely intentional.

434
00:42:47,740 --> 00:42:50,700
If you want to know who jumped off the cliff, Hai or not,

435
00:42:51,420 --> 00:42:54,140
can't we verify it with Captain Xiao?

436
00:42:54,540 --> 00:42:55,700
How to verify it?

437
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:57,620
Hi didn't leave any evidence,

438
00:42:57,630 --> 00:42:58,960
what do we verify it with?

439
00:42:59,900 --> 00:43:00,580
Hi are dead,

440
00:43:00,580 --> 00:43:01,850
but his younger brother, Gang, is still alive.

441
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:05,900
Through DNA testing, we can see whether the two of them are related.

442
00:43:07,900 --> 00:43:08,780
Lend me your cell phone.

443
00:43:15,780 --> 00:43:17,820
Just leave this matter to me, you don't need to take care of it anymore.

444
00:43:19,300 --> 00:43:19,860
Besides that,

445
00:43:20,450 --> 00:43:22,140
Feng Meng returns to look for Lu Er to smuggle goods.

446
00:43:22,560 --> 00:43:24,300
They can be extreme if cornered, you have to be careful.

447
00:43:35,420 --> 00:43:36,380
Halo, Zhong.

448
00:43:37,060 --> 00:43:38,180
You don't need to go to Hebei.

449
00:43:38,900 --> 00:43:39,900
Zhu Jianhai has a younger brother,

450
00:43:40,100 --> 00:43:41,300
he is now in Nanzhou.
