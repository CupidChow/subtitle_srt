=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 37=

3
00:01:33,460 --> 00:01:34,820
Not only is there no record at the hospital,

4
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:37,780
even the crematorium also has no record of Hai's cremation.

5
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,260
It can be said that,

6
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:41,300
we don't really know who the ashes belong to

7
00:01:41,380 --> 00:01:42,980
which was brought back by Feng Xiaosheng.

8
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:44,740
Also there is one other possibility,

9
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:46,340
which he brought home

10
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,460
not ashes at all.

11
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:48,140
Wait.

12
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:50,940
Hi, what do you mean by this?

13
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:52,740
is Gang's older brother.

14
00:01:53,580 --> 00:01:54,740
Didn't he die a long time ago?

15
00:01:55,780 --> 00:01:56,820
That's right, his older brother Gang.

16
00:01:57,700 --> 00:02:00,260
I suspect that it was Shen Shijie who died from falling off that cliff

17
00:02:00,700 --> 00:02:01,820
actually is Hi.

18
00:02:02,300 --> 00:02:03,980
Severe damage to the corpse's face,

19
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:05,460
that was also definitely intentional.

20
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:12,380
If you want to know

21
00:02:12,580 --> 00:02:14,260
who jumped off the cliff Hi or not,

22
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,700
can't we verify it

23
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:17,700
to Captain Xiao?

24
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:19,260
How to verify it?

25
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:21,180
Hi didn't leave any evidence,

26
00:02:21,260 --> 00:02:22,260
what do we verify it with?

27
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:24,140
Hi are dead,

28
00:02:24,140 --> 00:02:25,340
but his younger brother, Gang, is still alive.

29
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,700
Through DNA testing, we can see

30
00:02:27,780 --> 00:02:29,460
Are the two of them related?

31
00:02:31,500 --> 00:02:32,340
Lend me your cell phone.

32
00:02:39,340 --> 00:02:40,420
Just leave this matter to me,

33
00:02:40,540 --> 00:02:41,340
you don't need to take care of it anymore.

34
00:02:42,860 --> 00:02:43,420
Besides that,

35
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,700
Feng Meng returns to look for Lu Er to smuggle goods.

36
00:02:46,220 --> 00:02:47,860
They can be extreme if cornered, you have to be careful.

37
00:02:59,020 --> 00:02:59,940
Halo, Zhong.

38
00:03:00,620 --> 00:03:01,740
You don't need to go to Hebei.

39
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,540
Zhu Jianhai has a younger brother

40
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,860
he is now in Nanzhou.

41
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:06,900
Good.

42
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,420
Kapten Xiao bilang,

43
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:20,300
he will investigate Hai's case.

44
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:21,980
I'm grateful.

45
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:23,820
If so, next,

46
00:03:23,820 --> 00:03:24,940
What should we do?

47
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,020
Now Gang is at my parents' place.

48
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:29,620
He became a guard as well as a supervisor.

49
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,300
You and Lian Lian go see Captain Xiao.

50
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,780
Tell him to be careful and alert when investigating the Gang.

51
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:40,220
Don't alarm Feng Xiaosheng.

52
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:43,860
Then, what about you?

53
00:03:45,660 --> 00:03:46,700
I have to go back.

54
00:03:47,620 --> 00:03:48,780
Feng Xiaosheng dan Feng Yong

55
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,820
now arguing.

56
00:03:50,060 --> 00:03:51,820
The situation is very volatile.

57
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:53,860
I have to watch him closely.

58
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:55,700
Can't.

59
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:57,180
It's too dangerous.

60
00:03:57,860 --> 00:03:58,860
I have to go back.

61
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:00,020
The transaction journal was still in his hand.

62
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:04,980
I'll look for the transaction journal.

63
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,820
You go with them,

64
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,780
then immediately save uncle and aunt from the Gang

65
00:04:08,900 --> 00:04:10,100
and immediately went to look for the police.

66
00:04:12,500 --> 00:04:14,020
We both go out together.

67
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:15,500
If you go back alone,

68
00:04:16,180 --> 00:04:17,220
How do you explain to him?

69
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:20,980
I would say not watching you well

70
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:22,420
and let you escape.

71
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:24,740
Lian Lian benar.

72
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:27,100
If you return to Feng Xiaosheng's side at a time like this,

73
00:04:27,260 --> 00:04:28,380
it's really very dangerous.

74
00:04:30,020 --> 00:04:30,660
Stay cool.

75
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:32,380
I can handle it.

76
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:39,580
Buddy.

77
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,700
Sorry.

78
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,620
No need to apologize.

79
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:53,260
I understand.

80
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:59,740
I also want to apologize to you.

81
00:05:02,260 --> 00:05:03,220
You guys should be more careful.

82
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,100
(Yushufang Inn)

83
00:05:37,820 --> 00:05:38,580
Let's go.

84
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:44,460
What's in that bag?

85
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:02,460
(Penginapan Chuxinyuan)

86
00:06:13,820 --> 00:06:15,100
These items are difficult to transport.

87
00:06:15,620 --> 00:06:16,820
If one or two pieces break,

88
00:06:16,820 --> 00:06:17,940
the loss must be huge.

89
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,140
Try to bring as much as possible.

90
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:26,020
This.

91
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:28,420
This...

92
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:30,340
must be stored properly.

93
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:54,140
Then, this... I'll put this together.

94
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:00,900
I'll move it first.

95
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:18,780
A fast one, yeah.

96
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,300
I'll think of a way

97
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:01,420
to take the item

98
00:08:01,780 --> 00:08:02,940
and immediately handed it over to the police.

99
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:05,100
I will work with you.

100
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:05,660
Can't.

101
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,940
You can't be found out.

102
00:08:08,100 --> 00:08:09,500
It doesn't matter if I succeed or not,

103
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:11,140
you can't care about it.

104
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:13,420
Have to keep following it.

105
00:08:14,620 --> 00:08:15,620
You don't understand it.

106
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,380
He is a very cunning person.

107
00:08:18,580 --> 00:08:19,460
Whatever he does

108
00:08:19,460 --> 00:08:21,100
will definitely leave a way out for himself.

109
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,860
So, before the final moment,

110
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:24,620
we can't be late at all.

111
00:08:24,940 --> 00:08:26,180
Can't let it slip away.

112
00:08:28,580 --> 00:08:29,420
Ke Ying.

113
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,620
You...

114
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,460
Previously I...

115
00:08:43,580 --> 00:08:45,300
really worried you would sympathize with him.

116
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:50,620
Your acting is very real.

117
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:53,820
Sometimes I really feel like you like this person.

118
00:08:58,300 --> 00:08:59,540
Not strange at all

119
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:01,100
if you have this thought.

120
00:09:03,060 --> 00:09:04,260
Because you don't know

121
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:05,980
what I've been through so far.

122
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:41,020
Sis.

123
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:42,940
Where is Ke Ying?

124
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:45,220
As soon as he came home he immediately locked himself in his room.

125
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:50,820
Lian Lian looking for trouble again?

126
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,260
I don't know.

127
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,020
Brother Ke also didn't let me get close.

128
00:09:54,460 --> 00:09:55,380
However, seen from afar,

129
00:09:55,980 --> 00:09:57,100
doesn't seem like much fun.

130
00:10:00,620 --> 00:10:01,980
All right, there's food in the dining room.

131
00:10:01,980 --> 00:10:02,740
Go eat.

132
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:39,060
Do you still not understand the nature of your own friend?

133
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:41,300
Are you really angry with him?

134
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:53,820
That's it.

135
00:10:54,300 --> 00:10:55,340
Just think it's my fault.

136
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:57,740
Just this trivial thing, is it worth it?

137
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:02,700
Shen Shijie.

138
00:11:06,740 --> 00:11:08,340
You have ruined my life.

139
00:11:12,740 --> 00:11:14,300
At first I had a very good job,

140
00:11:15,380 --> 00:11:16,260
parents who love me,

141
00:11:16,260 --> 00:11:17,220
lover who loves me,

142
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:20,620
and friends who can get along with me.

143
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:24,580
Meanwhile all this...

144
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:29,460
I won't be able to have it again.

145
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:46,820
I want to run away with you,

146
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:50,740
change appearance,

147
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:52,740
hide your true identity.

148
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,260
I can't go back to my identity as Ke Ying anymore.

149
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:14,620
When will you leave?

150
00:12:19,500 --> 00:12:20,700
You don't need to hide it from me.

151
00:12:21,860 --> 00:12:24,020
I know, even though Big Boss Feng didn't give you money,

152
00:12:24,020 --> 00:12:24,860
you're still going too.

153
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,060
You won't let the police catch you.

154
00:12:31,940 --> 00:12:32,860
In these few days.

155
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,420
before leaving,

156
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:37,340
I want to stay one night at my parents' house.

157
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:44,500
Good.

158
00:13:08,700 --> 00:13:09,420
Have you finished eating?

159
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:11,140
Sis.

160
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:13,860
You go home first.

161
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:15,300
I will contact you if there is a problem.

162
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,660
Don't I need to stay?

163
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:17,740
What if something happens?

164
00:13:18,180 --> 00:13:18,820
No need.

165
00:13:19,260 --> 00:13:20,020
Go home.

166
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,460
OK, call me if there's a problem.

167
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,060
Halo.

168
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:52,100
Good.

169
00:13:53,980 --> 00:13:54,700
I understand.

170
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:03,540
These few days you have to be more careful.

171
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:05,300
Take it easy, Captain Xiao.

172
00:14:05,820 --> 00:14:07,140
We know what to do.

173
00:14:08,660 --> 00:14:09,620
Oh, yes, Journalist Lian.

174
00:14:10,220 --> 00:14:11,860
How is your mother's condition lately?

175
00:14:14,380 --> 00:14:15,860
Why? Don't you know?

176
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,580
I've been outside all the time lately,

177
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,660
I haven't seen my mother for a long time.

178
00:14:22,420 --> 00:14:23,340
What's wrong with him?

179
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:26,860
I heard it from other people too.

180
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,820
He said that recently Deputy Mayor Lian was sick.

181
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:31,380
He went out of town on leave to be checked.

182
00:14:31,980 --> 00:14:33,380
Why didn't he even tell you?

183
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,460
Auntie is probably afraid that you will worry.

184
00:14:37,940 --> 00:14:38,820
Don't be anxious yet.

185
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,260
Call him and ask about his condition.

186
00:14:42,940 --> 00:14:44,180
My mother is always like this.

187
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:45,900
Just telling good news.

188
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:47,340
Especially to me.

189
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:49,020
He will cover it more.

190
00:14:51,660 --> 00:14:52,540
You don't need to deliver.

191
00:14:52,540 --> 00:14:53,420
We said goodbye first.

192
00:14:54,060 --> 00:14:55,300
OK, then you guys go.

193
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:56,420
I'm not delivering anymore.

194
00:15:17,380 --> 00:15:18,140
I'm sorry.

195
00:15:25,340 --> 00:15:26,220
(Sorry,)

196
00:15:26,220 --> 00:15:27,540
(the number you dialed)

197
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:28,580
- What is it? - (currently inactive.)

198
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:32,180
Everything is off.

199
00:15:34,100 --> 00:15:35,100
Maybe just a coincidence.

200
00:15:41,460 --> 00:15:42,060
Lian Lian.

201
00:15:45,700 --> 00:15:46,700
Just get ready first.

202
00:15:47,700 --> 00:15:48,740
Wait for news from me.

203
00:15:51,540 --> 00:15:52,420
Let's finish it first.

204
00:15:55,140 --> 00:15:56,060
Why call me?

205
00:15:56,820 --> 00:15:57,860
I have dinner appointments,

206
00:15:58,780 --> 00:15:59,660
come with me

207
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:01,580
Who with?

208
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:03,340
You'll know when you get there.

209
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,180
What is this gang really up to?

210
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:27,620
According to me,

211
00:16:28,460 --> 00:16:31,260
immediately lured him, arrested him and brought him back for interrogation,

212
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,220
isn't that all right?

213
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:33,220
Can't.

214
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:35,100
We still don't know now

215
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,500
bagaimana Gang dan Feng Xiaosheng

216
00:16:36,500 --> 00:16:37,700
interconnected.

217
00:16:38,020 --> 00:16:39,260
If you catch Gang now,

218
00:16:39,620 --> 00:16:40,940
it might alert Feng Xiaosheng.

219
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,980
Is there any way to contact

220
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,820
Ke Ying's parents secretly?

221
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:47,260
Let's ask about the situation first.

222
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:39,060
Wait for me a moment.

223
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:56,860
Very simple.

224
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:35,860
What is it?

225
00:19:41,340 --> 00:19:42,220
I want to see more.

226
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:45,580
After leaving,

227
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:47,100
I don't know when I'll see him again.

228
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:50,420
Wait a few more years, after the problem subsides,

229
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:52,380
you can come back whenever you want.

230
00:19:53,660 --> 00:19:54,780
No one will watch over you anymore.

231
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,420
Can you

232
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,940
let me go?

233
00:20:18,180 --> 00:20:19,700
I will let you go if you give birth to my child.

234
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:26,060
Pretend I didn't say it.

235
00:20:33,220 --> 00:20:34,140
It's about to arrive, right?

236
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,780
Up ahead.

237
00:20:38,060 --> 00:20:39,220
Who do you actually want to eat with?

238
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:41,140
So mysterious.

239
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,060
Your father and mother.

240
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,780
You've gone crazy, haven't you?

241
00:20:49,180 --> 00:20:50,700
There's nothing to do, why are you meeting them?

242
00:20:51,780 --> 00:20:53,420
Didn't you say so yourself? You miss them.

243
00:20:55,460 --> 00:20:56,660
I really miss them.

244
00:20:56,660 --> 00:20:57,660
I want to meet them, but...

245
00:20:58,660 --> 00:20:59,820
I invited them to eat

246
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:00,980
just to make you happy.

247
00:21:02,340 --> 00:21:03,300
Do not be mad at me.

248
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:12,860
Well, thank you for your kindness.

249
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:15,220
However, I wasn't happy in the slightest.

250
00:21:16,180 --> 00:21:16,900
Why?

251
00:21:17,060 --> 00:21:17,980
You carry a gun.

252
00:21:18,420 --> 00:21:19,460
If they see it,

253
00:21:19,460 --> 00:21:20,460
they would definitely be scared.

254
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:21,660
Just calm down.

255
00:21:22,300 --> 00:21:23,300
I won't let them see it.

256
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:34,420
Could it be that you're going to run away after dinner?

257
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:37,820
You're so smart,

258
00:21:37,860 --> 00:21:39,180
You must have guessed it from the start, right?

259
00:21:39,860 --> 00:21:41,660
Otherwise, you wouldn't have said...

260
00:21:43,700 --> 00:21:44,940
"After leaving,"

261
00:21:44,940 --> 00:21:46,220
"I don't know when I'll see him again."

262
00:21:49,780 --> 00:21:51,580
However, I didn't expect it to be so sudden.

263
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,700
Halo.

264
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,980
Hello, dad.

265
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:30,700
Where have you arrived?

266
00:22:35,660 --> 00:22:36,700
Soon we will arrive.

267
00:22:37,780 --> 00:22:38,380
Of.

268
00:22:38,860 --> 00:22:40,380
Restoran Weimingju di Hotel Kaiyuan.

269
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:42,420
I just found out too.

270
00:22:43,060 --> 00:22:44,580
He said he wanted to give me a surprise.

271
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,220
In two days he will go on duty.

272
00:22:46,420 --> 00:22:47,460
Coincidentally I have time tonight,

273
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:48,380
so, want to meet us.

274
00:22:50,700 --> 00:22:51,380
Good.

275
00:22:54,780 --> 00:22:55,700
Be careful on the way.

276
00:22:56,220 --> 00:22:57,340
It's okay, no rush.

277
00:22:57,940 --> 00:22:58,900
See you later.

278
00:23:09,820 --> 00:23:10,340
Halo.

279
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,540
Zhong.

280
00:23:12,100 --> 00:23:13,300
Keep following his parents Ke Ying.

281
00:23:13,580 --> 00:23:14,780
They will go to Kaiyuan Hotel.

282
00:23:15,060 --> 00:23:16,100
I'll rush there too.

283
00:23:42,340 --> 00:23:43,060
Kapten Xiao.

284
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,460
They've arrived.

285
00:23:46,380 --> 00:23:47,300
I've arrived too.

286
00:23:49,380 --> 00:23:49,900
Good.

287
00:24:23,900 --> 00:24:25,180
Is it over here?

288
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:27,100
Over there.

289
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
I went to greet him.

290
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,740
Don't rush, wait a little longer.

291
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:52,260
Hello, Gang.

292
00:24:54,060 --> 00:24:55,300
Master Feng, they have arrived.

293
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:57,260
Good.

294
00:24:57,700 --> 00:24:58,300
I understand.

295
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,860
Keep a close eye on the entrance.

296
00:25:18,340 --> 00:25:19,060
Ayo.

297
00:25:23,580 --> 00:25:24,140
Mother!

298
00:25:25,820 --> 00:25:26,500
Mother.

299
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:41,860
(Sorry,)

300
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:44,260
(the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

301
00:25:57,540 --> 00:26:02,700
(Lian Lian, take care of yourself, wait for Mom to come home; Mom)

302
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:47,740
Kapten Xiao.

303
00:26:48,860 --> 00:26:49,500
How?

304
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,500
Xing Wei had already entered following them.

305
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:06,700
How?

306
00:27:07,780 --> 00:27:09,580
Ke Ying's parents walked into the VIP room on the second floor.

307
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,620
The space was booked by Feng Xiaosheng.

308
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:15,060
Could it be Ke Ying

309
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:17,260
forced by Feng Xiaosheng?

310
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:19,820
So, sending us here to save his parents?

311
00:27:21,860 --> 00:27:23,220
The meaning of the call

312
00:27:23,780 --> 00:27:24,900
is to imply us

313
00:27:24,900 --> 00:27:26,980
that Feng Xiaosheng might take action,

314
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:29,140
or...

315
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,820
wants us to stop him.

316
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,540
Didn't want to let Feng Xiaosheng meet his parents.

317
00:27:35,540 --> 00:27:37,260
Here is a public place.

318
00:27:37,700 --> 00:27:39,260
As long as Feng Xiaosheng doesn't go crazy,

319
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:41,620
he wouldn't dare do anything to Ke Ying's parents.

320
00:27:41,740 --> 00:27:42,340
Correct.

321
00:28:29,740 --> 00:28:31,060
Where do you want to go?

322
00:28:33,580 --> 00:28:34,180
I...

323
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,460
Mother.

324
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:42,220
Can you answer me first?

325
00:28:44,660 --> 00:28:45,980
Where do you want to go?

326
00:28:50,020 --> 00:28:51,620
Is it the same as when I was little?

327
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:53,500
Said he was going to work.

328
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:55,980
Once gone, will be gone for a long time.

329
00:28:57,180 --> 00:28:58,460
Leaving me with grandma.

330
00:29:00,900 --> 00:29:01,820
Leave me here.

331
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,500
However, now the grandmother is gone.

332
00:29:12,020 --> 00:29:13,540
Such a big house...

333
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,660
if you really go,

334
00:29:20,780 --> 00:29:22,580
there will only be me left.

335
00:29:25,900 --> 00:29:26,620
Lian Lian.

336
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,940
I don't have time to explain it to you.

337
00:29:30,180 --> 00:29:31,420
Mother left some money

338
00:29:31,420 --> 00:29:33,420
and things for you in this house.

339
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:35,700
Mother also wrote a letter for you,

340
00:29:35,700 --> 00:29:37,020
it is written very clearly.

341
00:29:37,500 --> 00:29:38,460
After some time,

342
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:40,300
when the situation has calmed down, you just follow.

343
00:29:40,300 --> 00:29:41,020
Mother.

344
00:29:42,900 --> 00:29:44,780
Mom knows I don't want this.

345
00:29:47,500 --> 00:29:48,500
Mom always knew that

346
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:50,500
what I want is not these items.

347
00:29:54,980 --> 00:29:56,020
I still remember

348
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,900
as a child when he said he wanted to go to work,

349
00:29:59,460 --> 00:30:01,340
You left me here for so long.

350
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:03,300
Do you still remember

351
00:30:03,300 --> 00:30:05,180
Have you ever given me a photo album?

352
00:30:07,820 --> 00:30:08,860
Inside it

353
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,740
there is a photo of a mother

354
00:30:12,140 --> 00:30:14,260
who holds a swaddled baby.

355
00:30:18,020 --> 00:30:18,780
Every night

356
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:20,380
I always use it as a sleeping pillow.

357
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:25,420
I really miss you.

358
00:30:29,140 --> 00:30:31,300
However, I also can't tell you to go home.

359
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,780
Now I'm an adult.

360
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:41,340
I don't want to pass

361
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,500
hard nights like that again.

362
00:30:45,300 --> 00:30:46,180
Mother.

363
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:51,420
Don't go, okay?

364
00:30:59,060 --> 00:31:00,100
Lian Lian.

365
00:31:02,180 --> 00:31:04,300
You know how much Mom loves you.

366
00:31:06,500 --> 00:31:08,500
Precisely because Mom loves you,

367
00:31:09,460 --> 00:31:12,100
want you to live a better life,

368
00:31:13,660 --> 00:31:15,620
New mothers make mistakes.

369
00:31:18,540 --> 00:31:21,060
Mother is too late to come back.

370
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,740
Mother.

371
00:31:26,260 --> 00:31:27,420
When I was little,

372
00:31:28,460 --> 00:31:30,540
every time the kindergarten school holds a parent meeting,

373
00:31:32,060 --> 00:31:33,580
You never left once.

374
00:31:34,580 --> 00:31:36,500
It's always grandma who represents you going.

375
00:31:38,940 --> 00:31:40,580
My friends

376
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:42,220
in kindergarten school,

377
00:31:42,820 --> 00:31:44,300
as soon as that day arrived,

378
00:31:45,020 --> 00:31:46,740
they mocked me loudly,

379
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:49,020
"You don't have a mother?"

380
00:31:49,380 --> 00:31:50,140
"Why your mother

381
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:51,580
never come here?"

382
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:53,460
However, I always answer

383
00:31:53,460 --> 00:31:54,860
them out loud,

384
00:31:56,940 --> 00:31:58,420
"I have a mother."

385
00:31:59,340 --> 00:32:02,100
"I have a mother who loves me very much."

386
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:05,060
"It's just that he's very busy,"

387
00:32:05,060 --> 00:32:06,540
"So, don't have time."

388
00:32:08,300 --> 00:32:10,220
"However, no matter where he is,"

389
00:32:11,500 --> 00:32:16,140
"I still feel proud of him."

390
00:32:21,740 --> 00:32:23,700
You used to always scold me,

391
00:32:24,580 --> 00:32:25,900
"My beloved daughter,"

392
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:28,500
"You've made a mistake."

393
00:32:29,660 --> 00:32:30,940
"Mother will accompany you

394
00:32:30,940 --> 00:32:32,180
together to fix it."

395
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:35,260
"As long as you fix it,"

396
00:32:35,260 --> 00:32:36,740
"Then you are my good daughter."

397
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,820
Today, I want to...

398
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:47,460
tell you.

399
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,500
I'm willing to wait for you,

400
00:32:53,660 --> 00:32:55,260
together accompany you.

401
00:32:57,420 --> 00:33:00,100
We can fix mistakes together, right?

402
00:33:03,380 --> 00:33:03,940
Mother.

403
00:33:07,900 --> 00:33:09,420
Just surrender,

404
00:33:10,700 --> 00:33:11,820
of?

405
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,220
Lian Lian.

406
00:33:22,980 --> 00:33:25,780
It doesn't matter which part of the earth you are in,

407
00:33:27,220 --> 00:33:29,180
as long as Mother lives,

408
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:31,420
we will surely meet again someday,

409
00:33:31,420 --> 00:33:32,420
isn't that so?

410
00:33:35,260 --> 00:33:36,780
Not like that.

411
00:33:38,340 --> 00:33:40,100
You should understand better than me,

412
00:33:41,420 --> 00:33:42,820
no problem

413
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:44,580
as simple as you think.

414
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:50,340
If you are willing to hear me

415
00:33:50,340 --> 00:33:51,580
to surrender,

416
00:33:55,420 --> 00:33:56,580
at least I can...

417
00:33:58,140 --> 00:34:00,100
Go see you when I miss you.

418
00:34:01,940 --> 00:34:03,580
Even...

419
00:34:04,660 --> 00:34:05,820
can touch you.

420
00:34:07,940 --> 00:34:09,100
Can know you every day

421
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:12,500
healthy or not,

422
00:34:13,020 --> 00:34:14,340
happy or not.

423
00:34:15,900 --> 00:34:17,460
If you really go,

424
00:34:20,340 --> 00:34:21,660
what do you think...

425
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,020
can you still come back?

426
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:28,580
Mother.

427
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:35,420
Mother.

428
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:20,900
I want to go to the toilet.

429
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,260
I will wait for you here.

430
00:36:00,420 --> 00:36:01,620
Fine, I understand.

431
00:36:02,020 --> 00:36:02,980
We'll be there soon.

432
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:26,580
How?

433
00:36:27,060 --> 00:36:28,020
The transaction journal is in his hand.

434
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,260
He also has a gun.

435
00:36:29,540 --> 00:36:30,220
Understand.

436
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,180
We split up.

437
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:34,180
You two go there.

438
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:34,860
You two come here.

439
00:38:30,260 --> 00:38:31,060
By car!

440
00:38:43,980 --> 00:38:45,540
He is different from us.

441
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:13,820
This...

442
00:39:13,820 --> 00:39:15,980
what actually happened?

443
00:39:16,580 --> 00:39:18,340
Ying Ying, tell us.

444
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,420
I went to open the door.

445
00:39:24,300 --> 00:39:25,180
A moment.

446
00:39:30,860 --> 00:39:31,420
Halo.

447
00:39:31,980 --> 00:39:32,540
Halo.

448
00:39:42,420 --> 00:39:42,980
Kapten Xiao.

449
00:39:43,860 --> 00:39:44,940
We failed to catch him.

450
00:39:45,460 --> 00:39:46,700
However, based on your report,

451
00:39:46,860 --> 00:39:49,740
we found a pile of monitoring and tracking devices in the next room.

452
00:39:50,100 --> 00:39:50,500
Besides that,

453
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:53,180
there was still some cash and gold stolen by Dao Jian.

454
00:39:58,500 --> 00:39:59,740
You have to catch him.

455
00:40:00,180 --> 00:40:01,060
Stay cool.

456
00:40:10,180 --> 00:40:10,700
Ying Ying.

457
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:12,220
Surface.

458
00:40:16,260 --> 00:40:17,380
You two don't need to worry.

459
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:19,060
Later, I'll let Ke Ying explain it to you slowly,

460
00:40:19,060 --> 00:40:20,220
What really happened.

461
00:40:23,900 --> 00:40:25,380
Uncle, Aunt.

462
00:40:31,220 --> 00:40:31,940
Stay cool.

463
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,220
Outside are our people

464
00:40:33,380 --> 00:40:34,540
which will protect your safety.

465
00:40:50,740 --> 00:40:51,540
Sis Wu, I'll go first, okay?

466
00:40:51,540 --> 00:40:52,100
Be careful, yes.

467
00:40:52,300 --> 00:40:52,940
I'll go first, OK, Sis Wu.

468
00:40:52,940 --> 00:40:53,900
- See you later. - See you later.

469
00:40:54,260 --> 00:40:54,820
See you soon.

470
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:55,500
Morning.

471
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:56,420
Morning.

472
00:41:01,340 --> 00:41:02,060
Sis Wu.

473
00:41:02,500 --> 00:41:03,700
Why haven't you moved house yet?

474
00:41:04,060 --> 00:41:05,100
With your current status,

475
00:41:05,260 --> 00:41:06,260
staying here is very inappropriate.

476
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:07,700
Not fit?

477
00:41:08,460 --> 00:41:09,460
Living here is not worth it?

478
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,540
Isn't it because I'm not willing to leave you?

479
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:13,420
It's an easy problem if you're not willing,

480
00:41:13,580 --> 00:41:14,300
True, or not?

481
00:41:14,460 --> 00:41:15,060
Buy a big house,

482
00:41:15,060 --> 00:41:15,980
we live together

483
00:41:16,100 --> 00:41:17,180
True, we live together.

484
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,500
Big house, huh?

485
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:20,420
Big house.

486
00:41:21,180 --> 00:41:22,540
How big is the mansion?

487
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:23,340
At least more...

488
00:41:23,340 --> 00:41:24,540
Wait until I'm rich, okay?

489
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:27,060
After buying the house on the top floor across there, we'll live there, okay?

490
00:41:27,500 --> 00:41:28,180
Brother Wu himself said, yes.

491
00:41:28,460 --> 00:41:29,500
You're good at fishing me, aren't you?

492
00:41:30,220 --> 00:41:30,820
See you, Sis Wu.

493
00:41:30,820 --> 00:41:31,300
See you soon.

494
00:41:31,300 --> 00:41:31,820
Be careful on the road, Sis Wu.

495
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:32,660
I go first.

496
00:41:34,420 --> 00:41:35,420
Hello, who is this?

497
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:39,260
How Sheng?

498
00:41:49,300 --> 00:41:49,860
Go up.

499
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:58,740
You're Brother Kun, right?

500
00:41:59,540 --> 00:42:01,220
Last time fishing...

501
00:42:02,060 --> 00:42:02,860
Don't be seen again.

502
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,940
Fish properly,

503
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:07,220
Your boss wants to eat fish tonight.

504
00:42:25,900 --> 00:42:26,940
Where is Sis Sheng?

505
00:42:28,260 --> 00:42:28,780
Go away.

506
00:42:29,300 --> 00:42:30,020
He's waiting for you.

507
00:42:31,900 --> 00:42:33,060
Give me back my phone!

508
00:43:32,340 --> 00:43:32,900
