00:01:21,620 --> 00:01:29,840
=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,840
=Episode 24=

3
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,260
Team two is in position, team two is in position.

4
00:02:37,060 --> 00:02:38,470
Team five is in position, team five is in position.

5
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:39,700
The suspect car was not moving.

6
00:02:42,260 --> 00:02:43,260
Attention, all teams,

7
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:44,860
without my order can not act.

8
00:02:44,890 --> 00:02:45,490
Ready.

9
00:03:14,630 --> 00:03:15,340
Team six is ​​in position,

10
00:03:15,340 --> 00:03:16,700
do not see the recipient.

11
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:19,540
Jin and Wu's car has not been found.

12
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:21,580
Captain,

13
00:03:22,060 --> 00:03:23,660
these three are definitely bait,

14
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,860
the goods must be in Jin and Wu's car.

15
00:03:31,420 --> 00:03:32,300
Song Jingzhong,

16
00:03:32,300 --> 00:03:34,260
immediately check all provincial roads leading to the mountains.

17
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:35,420
You did it yourself, okay?

18
00:03:35,700 --> 00:03:36,300
Good.

19
00:03:39,500 --> 00:03:40,780
Get on the mountain highway, fast.

20
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:11,100
(Be careful of falling rocks)

21
00:04:12,820 --> 00:04:13,860
Electric Boss,

22
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,250
There should be no more checkpoints ahead, right?

23
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:18,460
When do we hand over the car?

24
00:04:19,020 --> 00:04:19,860
Quick.

25
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,340
Be careful!

26
00:04:30,700 --> 00:04:31,260
Go,

27
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:32,380
move it.

28
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:37,060
I go alone?

29
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:42,140
Boss, you see,

30
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,460
How can my skinny legs and arms move it?

31
00:04:47,180 --> 00:04:48,740
Moreover, look at the situation outside,

32
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:50,380
so...

33
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,340
true, right?

34
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,420
Ayo.

35
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,100
Halo.

36
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:38,980
What?

37
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:39,700
possible?

38
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:42,100
Then, who will give us the money?

39
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:42,620
Not...

40
00:05:48,620 --> 00:05:49,620
What situation is this?

41
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:03,740
Captain Xiao, each team asks if they need to arrest their person.

42
00:06:04,260 --> 00:06:05,020
Keep following me,

43
00:06:05,180 --> 00:06:06,380
without my order can not act.

44
00:06:06,540 --> 00:06:07,180
Good.

45
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:12,940
Tell the border guards to help find Jin and Wu.

46
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,300
One way or another, they must be found!

47
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:14,780
Good.

48
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:22,300
Let's go!

49
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:44,900
Road.

50
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:46,420
Be a little careful.

51
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:52,740
Road.

52
00:07:54,260 --> 00:07:54,860
Isi.

53
00:08:26,260 --> 00:08:26,820
Ayo,

54
00:08:27,140 --> 00:08:28,140
quick, quick

55
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:28,860
Follow.

56
00:08:44,740 --> 00:08:45,620
What's this?

57
00:08:46,020 --> 00:08:46,980
After struggling,

58
00:08:46,980 --> 00:08:48,820
instead it was brought back to me intact.

59
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:51,620
Just helping a friend.

60
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,940
According to the principal's prediction,

61
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:55,740
must give gifts in the form of cash, new business can run smoothly.

62
00:08:56,380 --> 00:08:57,940
If that's the case, I'll have to recalculate it,

63
00:08:58,100 --> 00:08:58,940
really troublesome.

64
00:08:59,260 --> 00:09:01,260
Bureau Chief Liu, count as carefully as possible,

65
00:09:01,260 --> 00:09:02,260
If it's not enough, I'll add it.

66
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:04,780
Come on, move it quickly.

67
00:09:24,380 --> 00:09:25,660
I'll pour more, okay?

68
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,260
Lawyer Yang,

69
00:09:28,260 --> 00:09:29,220
today is a happy day,

70
00:09:29,220 --> 00:09:30,780
either way, you should drink a few glasses.

71
00:09:31,980 --> 00:09:32,980
Thank You.

72
00:09:33,380 --> 00:09:34,380
Yucheng,

73
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:35,420
Meng,

74
00:09:36,140 --> 00:09:37,780
you two have worked hard.

75
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:39,860
today,

76
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:42,140
Let's celebrate a little first.

77
00:09:42,260 --> 00:09:44,020
Later, when everything is settled,

78
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,940
let's drink wine again in a big way.

79
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:48,700
Good.

80
00:09:49,340 --> 00:09:49,940
Let's drink.

81
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:50,620
Thank you, Big Boss.

82
00:09:50,620 --> 00:09:51,460
Thank you, Second Uncle.

83
00:09:53,780 --> 00:10:00,400
(The law binds and unites, does not take sides, cannot be bent)

84
00:10:01,460 --> 00:10:02,100
Good.

85
00:10:03,500 --> 00:10:05,820
Any developments, please report to me immediately.

86
00:10:16,500 --> 00:10:20,900
This whole night, you guys have worked hard.

87
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:26,020
Your assessment is completely correct.

88
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,780
Regarding the person who borrowed a resident's phone to report the situation to you...

89
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:31,860
He is my informant.

90
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:33,980
That's the...

91
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:34,860
Yes, he's the one.

92
00:10:39,980 --> 00:10:42,420
He reported his delivery location on time,

93
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:43,940
his contribution is extraordinary.

94
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:45,540
There's no problem, right?

95
00:10:47,460 --> 00:10:49,100
So as not to alert them,

96
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:51,660
The fishing location was chosen in the open sea.

97
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:53,180
Stay cool.

98
00:10:53,780 --> 00:10:56,060
We have secured all the gold,

99
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,380
not a single gram was lost.

100
00:10:58,940 --> 00:10:59,820
That's good then.

101
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,020
that's good then.

102
00:11:02,860 --> 00:11:05,860
Where is that Wu now?

103
00:11:09,940 --> 00:11:10,780
There are two possibilities.

104
00:11:11,640 --> 00:11:13,160
The first possibility, he defected to them.

105
00:11:13,540 --> 00:11:15,060
Otherwise, he wouldn't have contacted me.

106
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:19,020
Also there is one more possibility,

107
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:24,420
that is, he was found out,

108
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,500
then killed.

109
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:38,620
sister,

110
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:40,860
it's not like I want to bullshit and lick,

111
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:42,940
but this trick of yours is really too great,

112
00:11:42,940 --> 00:11:44,500
completely outwit a bunch of people.

113
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,100
Every time I think of them, I...

114
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:47,940
Meng.

115
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,540
"Don't be arrogant when you succeed,

116
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:54,380
Don't be discouraged when you fail.",

117
00:11:55,500 --> 00:11:56,460
must be remembered.

118
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:57,780
Be careful...

119
00:11:57,780 --> 00:11:59,340
Be careful with your words and actions.

120
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:00,820
I remember, I remember.

121
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,300
Yucheng,

122
00:12:04,020 --> 00:12:05,900
you have to hurry quickly.

123
00:12:06,100 --> 00:12:08,580
We have given them what they want.

124
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:14,540
So they must give us what we want as quickly as possible.

125
00:12:15,060 --> 00:12:15,580
Understand.

126
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,100
Company internal affairs,

127
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,900
You also won't understand even if I explain it to you.

128
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:28,660
Wait, there will be time,

129
00:12:29,060 --> 00:12:31,460
I will explain to you slowly.

130
00:12:32,220 --> 00:12:32,780
Good,

131
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:34,340
I understand.

132
00:12:35,820 --> 00:12:36,980
Oh, yes, Brother,

133
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:39,580
the Aoxin car that Sheng recently worked on

134
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:41,620
it's quite popular now.

135
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:43,380
There are many people who call me,

136
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,660
wanted to take advantage of his connection with me to get it.

137
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:47,180
How about you contact Sheng

138
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:49,020
to get eight to 10 cars for me?

139
00:12:49,500 --> 00:12:51,700
No, but we still have to maintain those connections.

140
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:54,220
You'd better not interfere too much

141
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,820
with internal company affairs.

142
00:13:01,060 --> 00:13:03,020
I'm... not interfering.

143
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:03,620
This...

144
00:13:03,620 --> 00:13:05,340
goods produced by our own company,

145
00:13:05,620 --> 00:13:07,020
I'm not not paying either,

146
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:09,020
can't I even have this privilege?

147
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:13,660
Second Uncle,

148
00:13:14,660 --> 00:13:17,700
the company already has plans regarding cars,

149
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:19,660
must be carried out step by step,

150
00:13:20,620 --> 00:13:22,180
can't be messed with at will.

151
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:25,380
Okay.

152
00:13:26,220 --> 00:13:27,780
Just adjust the plan.

153
00:13:30,060 --> 00:13:31,300
Is he still...

154
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,060
take the woman to the office?

155
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:35,980
It seems the last two days have not.

156
00:13:37,060 --> 00:13:38,460
Woman... what woman?

157
00:13:41,580 --> 00:13:42,980
I... talk too much,

158
00:13:42,980 --> 00:13:43,700
I am wrong.

159
00:13:52,060 --> 00:13:52,740
Halo.

160
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:54,540
Who?

161
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,020
What is it?

162
00:13:59,140 --> 00:13:59,740
What?

163
00:14:00,980 --> 00:14:01,900
Is it Lian?

164
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:07,540
No, what actually happened?

165
00:14:12,820 --> 00:14:15,220
Didn't he say everything was safe?

166
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:16,900
Then, how did you get out?

167
00:14:20,060 --> 00:14:20,900
OK, I know.

168
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:25,980
What's the problem?

169
00:14:32,260 --> 00:14:32,860
That...

170
00:14:33,460 --> 00:14:35,180
the goods have been detained by anti-smuggling authorities.

171
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,900
What really happened?

172
00:14:41,060 --> 00:14:42,540
Didn't he say that everything has reached the high seas?

173
00:14:44,020 --> 00:14:45,100
Who told you this news?

174
00:14:45,580 --> 00:14:46,300
Is it Lian?

175
00:14:49,220 --> 00:14:50,940
So, where is he now?

176
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,820
The item is detained, so what happens to it?

177
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:56,540
Say.

178
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,980
That...

179
00:15:00,980 --> 00:15:01,860
To Lian as,

180
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:03,580
Initially everything went smoothly.

181
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:06,100
The open sea is in sight,

182
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:08,580
unexpectedly, the maritime police actually appeared to patrol.

183
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:10,500
This item...

184
00:15:10,500 --> 00:15:12,140
then the goods are detained.

185
00:15:13,460 --> 00:15:15,020
Ba Lian was not arrested,

186
00:15:15,980 --> 00:15:18,900
Maybe he was acting on behalf of the anti-smuggling party?

187
00:15:19,460 --> 00:15:20,620
and polish our goods?

188
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,420
No, that Ba Lian would not dare,

189
00:15:22,420 --> 00:15:23,260
he didn't have the guts for that.

190
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:24,620
Plus,

191
00:15:24,620 --> 00:15:27,580
he also couldn't determine when the maritime police would patrol,

192
00:15:27,580 --> 00:15:28,940
there are so many eyes watching.

193
00:15:28,940 --> 00:15:29,820
Mainly because

194
00:15:29,820 --> 00:15:31,140
he wasn't on that cargo ship,

195
00:15:31,140 --> 00:15:32,180
he was on another ship.

196
00:15:32,660 --> 00:15:33,900
Maritime police also boarded the ship

197
00:15:33,900 --> 00:15:35,580
and he was let go because he had no problems.

198
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:38,420
So, his goods were detained, while he was okay.

199
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,660
sister,

200
00:15:43,380 --> 00:15:44,980
smuggling of these goods,

201
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:47,980
however it still depends on luck.

202
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:49,460
You... just calm down,

203
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,300
the people on the ship knew nothing.

204
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:52,060
Even though they were arrested,

205
00:15:52,060 --> 00:15:53,620
it wouldn't involve us either.

206
00:16:04,100 --> 00:16:05,260
It's also true what second uncle said.

207
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:07,740
We have planned very carefully,

208
00:16:08,260 --> 00:16:09,500
Our defense is quite thick.

209
00:16:09,900 --> 00:16:11,620
Even if the police suspect us,

210
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,870
they also won't be able to get any solid evidence.

211
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:15,700
Correct.

212
00:16:16,980 --> 00:16:18,580
The police want to check you,

213
00:16:20,180 --> 00:16:22,060
it was something that would happen sooner or later.

214
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:25,700
Then... we...

215
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:27,060
Endure,

216
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,380
we have to survive.

217
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:32,140
We can't

218
00:16:32,900 --> 00:16:34,380
panic first.

219
00:16:35,260 --> 00:16:35,860
Understand.

220
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:41,580
Fate is not on our side.

221
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,060
The time is coming soon.

222
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,140
We have to hurry.

223
00:17:28,820 --> 00:17:29,860
Halo.

224
00:17:34,740 --> 00:17:36,740
I'm not buying, selling, or renting a house,

225
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,180
so, no need for a loan.

226
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,740
Get up, let's continue working.

227
00:18:11,300 --> 00:18:12,460
How? Have you found it?

228
00:18:22,580 --> 00:18:23,220
Good.

229
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:25,020
Good.

230
00:18:27,220 --> 00:18:28,020
Thank You.

231
00:18:28,020 --> 00:18:29,610
I'll treat you to a sumptuous meal after you return.

232
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:30,820
Yes.

233
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:33,260
What happened?

234
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:36,340
False.

235
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:40,860
What's fake?

236
00:18:40,860 --> 00:18:41,780
Is the passport fake?

237
00:18:43,220 --> 00:18:44,260
The passport is original,

238
00:18:44,260 --> 00:18:45,620
also a native American citizen.

239
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:48,060
However, he is by no means a new energy expert,

240
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,260
but he is a homeless man,

241
00:18:49,260 --> 00:18:50,340
and was involved in a fraud case.

242
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,620
If he is a fake expert,

243
00:19:12,620 --> 00:19:13,500
then you could say,

244
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,940
the technology is also definitely fake.

245
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:18,660
(Affiliate transaction)

246
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,500
Affiliate transactions, what do they mean?

247
00:19:24,140 --> 00:19:24,860
Look,

248
00:19:26,060 --> 00:19:27,900
the raw material warehouse is empty,

249
00:19:28,140 --> 00:19:29,820
car factories are not producing at all,

250
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,460
the expert from America is fake,

251
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:33,660
then the technology cannot be real.

252
00:19:34,580 --> 00:19:35,860
Fake technology and fake cars,

253
00:19:37,300 --> 00:19:39,300
state subsidies for new energy cars,

254
00:19:39,780 --> 00:19:41,220
large bank loans,

255
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,020
and investment from state-owned companies.

256
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,420
The Feng Group's new energy car

257
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:49,380
is just a hoax on a gigantic scale.

258
00:20:04,300 --> 00:20:05,060
Impossible,

259
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:07,180
definitely impossible.

260
00:20:37,900 --> 00:20:38,500
For you.

261
00:20:41,060 --> 00:20:41,900
OK, you go home.

262
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,380
Good.

263
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:16,580
What's wrong with you?

264
00:21:18,940 --> 00:21:20,420
Did you get wet in the rain last night?

265
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:22,180
The whole body is uncomfortable, isn't it?

266
00:21:25,980 --> 00:21:27,540
Why did you come back so early today?

267
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:30,980
Didn't I come straight back after work?

268
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,220
Do you want to go abroad?

269
00:21:49,700 --> 00:21:52,300
The province arranged for the entrepreneurs to travel to Europe for inspection.

270
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,540
I also went along to go have a look.

271
00:21:55,220 --> 00:21:55,500
Oh yes,

272
00:21:55,500 --> 00:21:56,940
Is there anything I need to bring you?

273
00:21:57,380 --> 00:21:59,330
We agreed, I won't care about other people's orders,

274
00:21:59,340 --> 00:22:00,220
only yours.

275
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Are you still coming back?

276
00:22:09,740 --> 00:22:10,780
What do you mean?

277
00:22:14,140 --> 00:22:15,060
After escaping this time,

278
00:22:15,740 --> 00:22:16,980
are you still back?

279
00:22:19,580 --> 00:22:20,220
no,

280
00:22:20,500 --> 00:22:21,820
you have a fever, right?

281
00:22:21,820 --> 00:22:22,980
Isn't this nonsense?

282
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:23,980
Reply me.

283
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:25,380
Deputy Mayor Lian,

284
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:27,700
will you run away?

285
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,860
Don't act.

286
00:22:29,140 --> 00:22:29,860
Reply me.

287
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:34,180
I don't want my voice to be heard by the neighbors.

288
00:22:41,300 --> 00:22:41,940
Okay.

289
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:43,940
Because you want answers,

290
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:45,060
then I'll tell you.

291
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:49,060
My trip to Europe this time was determined by the province.

292
00:22:49,260 --> 00:22:50,500
Vice Governor Tang led the team,

293
00:22:50,820 --> 00:22:52,420
he called me to accompany him.

294
00:22:52,820 --> 00:22:55,440
This is because next year I will probably be assigned to the provincial level

295
00:22:55,460 --> 00:22:56,500
to manage the economy.

296
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,180
This is a diplomatic passport,

297
00:22:59,420 --> 00:23:00,220
just given,

298
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:01,220
do you want to see?

299
00:23:02,420 --> 00:23:03,700
Are you satisfied with my answer?

300
00:23:09,260 --> 00:23:11,610
You're in charge of the Feng Group's electric car project, right?

301
00:23:11,620 --> 00:23:12,140
Correct.

302
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,740
Have you ever taken their money?

303
00:23:13,740 --> 00:23:14,540
Never.

304
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,870
Are you their protective umbrella?

305
00:23:15,920 --> 00:23:16,500
No!

306
00:23:16,510 --> 00:23:18,220
Did you know this project was in trouble?

307
00:23:18,220 --> 00:23:19,180
What's the problem?

308
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,060
This is just a big scam!

309
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:22,660
Who did you hear from?

310
00:23:22,660 --> 00:23:23,900
Do you have any proof?

311
00:23:23,900 --> 00:23:26,100
I not only heard it, but I saw it myself.

312
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:28,580
The car factory is not operating at all,

313
00:23:28,580 --> 00:23:30,340
the raw material warehouses are also all empty,

314
00:23:30,340 --> 00:23:32,140
technology supervisors from abroad are also fake,

315
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:34,100
only the money from fraud is real!

316
00:23:35,420 --> 00:23:36,660
Are these all the results of your investigation?

317
00:23:36,660 --> 00:23:37,380
Correct.

318
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:40,020
I'm telling you now,

319
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:41,580
that's not possible!

320
00:23:41,660 --> 00:23:42,980
You lie.

321
00:23:44,740 --> 00:23:46,060
You know everything.

322
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:48,620
You know everything from the beginning to the present.

323
00:23:49,100 --> 00:23:50,940
You know that the Feng Group is lawless.

324
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:53,540
You know what they're doing is a big scam,

325
00:23:53,540 --> 00:23:55,260
but you still gave them permission.

326
00:23:56,000 --> 00:23:56,860
Guarantee their safety,

327
00:23:56,860 --> 00:23:58,250
act as their protective umbrella.

328
00:23:58,860 --> 00:23:59,860
For the sake of what?

329
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:01,940
Achievements in your political career,

330
00:24:02,940 --> 00:24:03,940
your position,

331
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:08,620
and your profits, right?

332
00:24:20,100 --> 00:24:20,700
Lian Lian,

333
00:24:23,460 --> 00:24:25,180
I never denied that

334
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:27,140
The Feng Group might be in trouble.

335
00:24:27,460 --> 00:24:28,980
I told you too,

336
00:24:29,260 --> 00:24:31,860
An investigative team has been formed and is investigating.

337
00:24:32,740 --> 00:24:34,180
Regarding whether or not there is a problem,

338
00:24:34,180 --> 00:24:35,660
everything has its own assessment.

339
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:36,660
I told you from the start,

340
00:24:36,660 --> 00:24:38,300
don't interfere.

341
00:24:38,900 --> 00:24:41,860
You can't judge good or bad just from appearance alone.

342
00:24:42,660 --> 00:24:43,180
no,

343
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:44,860
I've told the story about

344
00:24:44,860 --> 00:24:46,690
the blind man who touched elephants when you were little.

345
00:24:48,140 --> 00:24:49,060
You're so mature,

346
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,900
You don't even understand things like this?

347
00:24:51,140 --> 00:24:52,940
I told you not to investigate, you're disobedient,

348
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,820
then now you are suspicious of me.

349
00:24:55,500 --> 00:24:57,980
Even though you... don't think of me as deputy mayor,

350
00:24:57,980 --> 00:24:59,140
but I'm still your mother!

351
00:25:02,820 --> 00:25:05,220
From childhood to adulthood, don't you know what kind of person I am?

352
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:07,500
What assets do I have? Tell me.

353
00:25:07,500 --> 00:25:08,560
What assets do I have?

354
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,380
Apart from this state-given house,

355
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:12,940
and that old house left by your grandmother,

356
00:25:13,610 --> 00:25:15,620
What benefits do I receive from them? Say!

357
00:25:19,660 --> 00:25:20,260
Good,

358
00:25:21,460 --> 00:25:22,460
I believe in you.

359
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,100
I believe in you because you are my mother,

360
00:25:26,740 --> 00:25:31,020
the person I love and respect the most since childhood.

361
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:34,580
From start to finish,

362
00:25:34,980 --> 00:25:36,580
I always make your integrity,

363
00:25:36,580 --> 00:25:38,340
as an example and my pride.

364
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,180
Even though everything is as you said earlier,

365
00:25:42,830 --> 00:25:44,370
that you never take bribes,

366
00:25:44,500 --> 00:25:45,460
but you know

367
00:25:45,740 --> 00:25:47,220
that the Feng Group is defrauding the country,

368
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:47,740
deceive the people,

369
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:49,620
are you going to just shut up and watch it?

370
00:25:49,740 --> 00:25:51,140
You know they're breaking the law,

371
00:25:51,140 --> 00:25:52,700
can you not stop it?

372
00:25:53,140 --> 00:25:54,620
So, what's the difference between you and them?

373
00:25:54,980 --> 00:25:56,780
What's the difference between you and those bastards?

374
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,620
Shut up!

375
00:26:06,820 --> 00:26:07,420
Lian Lian,

376
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:11,740
Since you were little, your mother taught you, gave you advice.

377
00:26:12,540 --> 00:26:14,900
Want to teach you the truest way to live.

378
00:26:16,540 --> 00:26:18,180
However, advice is just advice,

379
00:26:18,380 --> 00:26:20,060
a statement is a statement.

380
00:26:21,180 --> 00:26:23,460
This world is not just black and white,

381
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,860
not that simple,

382
00:26:25,860 --> 00:26:26,540
But...

383
00:26:26,540 --> 00:26:29,260
Sometimes we can only think about our own interests, right?

384
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:38,900
Mother,

385
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:41,620
you are really great

386
00:26:43,060 --> 00:26:44,460
From childhood to adulthood,

387
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:48,020
You taught me how to differentiate right from wrong,

388
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:49,860
differentiate between good and bad.

389
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:53,520
However, what about now?

390
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:55,380
You told me instead

391
00:26:55,380 --> 00:26:57,220
that in this world there is no right and wrong,

392
00:26:57,220 --> 00:26:58,860
there is no distinguishable good and bad.

393
00:27:05,900 --> 00:27:08,980
Congratulations, Deputy Mayor Lian.

394
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:14,180
Finally you became the person I hated the most.

395
00:28:05,020 --> 00:28:05,540
Halo.

396
00:28:06,060 --> 00:28:06,780
Fan,

397
00:28:07,340 --> 00:28:09,860
send someone to follow Lian Lian for 24 hours.

398
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,940
Then, tell Feng Yong,

399
00:28:12,340 --> 00:28:15,020
so he will be more careful about the electric car project.

400
00:28:15,420 --> 00:28:16,660
Someone started investigating it.

401
00:30:35,660 --> 00:30:37,660
(Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors)

402
00:30:39,260 --> 00:30:39,860
Enter.

403
00:30:47,740 --> 00:30:48,700
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

404
00:30:48,700 --> 00:30:50,420
the phone you want has already been purchased.

405
00:31:04,900 --> 00:31:05,980
Is there anything else?

406
00:31:06,900 --> 00:31:08,420
Mr. Wang called earlier,

407
00:31:08,420 --> 00:31:09,900
ask when you will be in the office,

408
00:31:09,900 --> 00:31:11,860
he has a document that you need to sign.

409
00:31:13,900 --> 00:31:14,980
Ask him to come now.

410
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,340
Good.

411
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:15,980
Enter.

412
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:21,500
Before the midterm exam, I will prepare a question and answer session for you,

413
00:32:21,500 --> 00:32:23,650
prepare all the questions you want to ask first,

414
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:25,170
in due course they will be answered together.

415
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,980
Did you hear?

416
00:32:27,660 --> 00:32:28,260
Miss Lecturer,

417
00:32:28,260 --> 00:32:30,420
can you provide a grid for this exam?

418
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,410
In that case, wouldn't it be better if I just gave you the test paper?

419
00:32:32,700 --> 00:32:33,460
That is true.

420
00:32:34,060 --> 00:32:35,180
See you, Mrs. Ke.

421
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:37,220
- See you, Miss Lecturer. - See you, Miss Lecturer.

422
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,220
Is there a need?

423
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:45,860
Nothing, just a coincidence passing by.

424
00:32:49,860 --> 00:32:50,620
Oh yes,

425
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:53,180
it has been discovered that David is a fraud,

426
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,700
and was involved in a case in America.

427
00:32:55,820 --> 00:32:56,500
What?

428
00:32:57,820 --> 00:32:58,820
David who?

429
00:33:01,540 --> 00:33:03,220
Weren't you the one who sent that email?

430
00:33:04,060 --> 00:33:04,820
What email?

431
00:33:05,540 --> 00:33:07,220
I never sent you an email at all.

432
00:33:07,220 --> 00:33:07,860
Ke Ying,

433
00:33:09,620 --> 00:33:10,940
for quite a long time,

434
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:15,460
I feel that you are another me in this world.

435
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,140
We respect each other,

436
00:33:17,140 --> 00:33:18,220
trust each other,

437
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,820
very close and nothing is kept secret.

438
00:33:22,220 --> 00:33:23,780
So, in my heart,

439
00:33:24,500 --> 00:33:26,060
I think our relationship is this

440
00:33:26,060 --> 00:33:28,100
should be stronger than romance,

441
00:33:28,780 --> 00:33:29,740
and last longer.

442
00:33:32,060 --> 00:33:33,020
However, now,

443
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:35,620
I don't understand you anymore.

444
00:33:36,500 --> 00:33:37,820
I've considered that too

445
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,540
various situations from your perspective.

446
00:33:39,890 --> 00:33:41,260
However, no matter what,

447
00:33:41,340 --> 00:33:43,260
That still can't explain your current changes.

448
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:46,780
I don't know why you suddenly turned out like this.

449
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:51,100
I also don't know why you didn't tell me anything.

450
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,980
What are you really hiding?

451
00:34:00,220 --> 00:34:01,940
Sorry, sorry, I didn't mean to.

452
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:02,860
It's okay, go quickly.

453
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:12,260
Are you listening to what I'm saying?

454
00:34:16,650 --> 00:34:17,740
I kept listening to it.

455
00:34:17,940 --> 00:34:19,260
Then, what's your answer?

456
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,740
Was it a waste of me to talk at such length earlier?

457
00:34:28,210 --> 00:34:28,980
Lian Lian,

458
00:34:29,650 --> 00:34:32,260
I can't completely agree with what you said just now.

459
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:34,460
No matter how close a friend is,

460
00:34:34,690 --> 00:34:36,170
they also have their own secrets.

461
00:34:37,170 --> 00:34:39,820
Humans sometimes cannot face their own hearts calmly,

462
00:34:39,820 --> 00:34:41,860
How can you completely trust others?

463
00:34:43,860 --> 00:34:44,820
You think so, right?

464
00:34:47,060 --> 00:34:47,900
Besides that,

465
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:50,690
every person in this world has their own uniqueness,

466
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:54,820
Even if two people are similar, it doesn't mean they are identical.

467
00:34:58,340 --> 00:35:01,220
You are not me, and I am not you.

468
00:35:05,580 --> 00:35:06,580
Ke Ying!

469
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:20,740
Yesterday when I was walking barefoot, I stepped on broken glass,

470
00:35:21,700 --> 00:35:22,980
can you guess which leg it is?

471
00:35:53,700 --> 00:35:55,220
What's in that your order?

472
00:35:57,980 --> 00:35:59,180
What is my order?

473
00:36:01,380 --> 00:36:02,820
Lian Lian came to campus today to meet me,

474
00:36:02,820 --> 00:36:03,980
someone was following him.

475
00:36:05,540 --> 00:36:06,540
Lian Lian?

476
00:36:07,710 --> 00:36:09,690
It seemed that he was also investigating about Aoxin's car.

477
00:36:09,860 --> 00:36:11,780
Asked me if it was all a fraud scheme.

478
00:36:18,260 --> 00:36:19,620
Then, what's your answer?

479
00:36:21,100 --> 00:36:22,660
What do you want me to answer?

480
00:36:29,140 --> 00:36:30,820
Why do you look strange today?

481
00:36:31,980 --> 00:36:33,140
Don't always furrow your eyebrows,

482
00:36:33,140 --> 00:36:34,140
Be careful, wrinkles will appear.

483
00:36:36,860 --> 00:36:37,620
Let's go.

484
00:36:37,620 --> 00:36:38,900
Accompany me to get my bag.

485
00:36:41,100 --> 00:36:42,540
Lian Lian is out, let's go quickly.

486
00:36:42,740 --> 00:36:44,180
Don't let him see you.

487
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,620
There's nothing to worry about,

488
00:37:05,620 --> 00:37:07,170
it was very clear the boy was just a stalker,

489
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:08,440
wouldn't dare do anything to your friend.

490
00:37:08,540 --> 00:37:10,100
Who exactly did he offend?

491
00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:14,260
When you're smart, you make other people tickle,

492
00:37:14,500 --> 00:37:16,380
but when you're stupid, really stupid.

493
00:37:16,860 --> 00:37:19,020
He dared to say that Aoxin's car was a fraud,

494
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:20,060
Who do you think he has offended?

495
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:23,980
Don't look at me,

496
00:37:23,980 --> 00:37:25,260
I told you, he's not my boss.

497
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:27,580
There is no mistake, he must have been ordered by the big boss.

498
00:37:28,340 --> 00:37:29,380
However, don't worry,

499
00:37:29,380 --> 00:37:30,820
isn't his mother the deputy mayor?

500
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:32,260
Big boss knows limits,

501
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,580
he wouldn't dare do anything to her.

502
00:37:34,740 --> 00:37:39,060
If Big Boss Feng knows that I helped you investigate about Aoxin,

503
00:37:39,060 --> 00:37:39,980
what will he do to me?

504
00:37:40,580 --> 00:37:44,700
It depends on how important you are to me.

505
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,380
There's a box under your feet,

506
00:37:51,380 --> 00:37:52,340
it's a gift for you.

507
00:37:58,060 --> 00:37:59,180
There's a box under your feet,

508
00:37:59,180 --> 00:38:00,340
it's a gift for you.

509
00:38:09,100 --> 00:38:09,980
Compensation for your cell phone.

510
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:17,180
I... I've replaced it with a new one,

511
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,860
so, this is not required.

512
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:22,380
Just exchange it and use the one I bought you.

513
00:38:29,500 --> 00:38:30,100
Good.

514
00:38:33,580 --> 00:38:35,180
That's it, no need to change.

515
00:38:35,620 --> 00:38:36,980
Just use what you like.

516
00:38:41,780 --> 00:38:42,700
Go straight, right?

517
00:38:52,580 --> 00:38:55,740
Please, Ray, I'm sick,

518
00:38:55,740 --> 00:38:57,900
I have to rest,

519
00:38:57,900 --> 00:39:00,380
this is my right.

520
00:39:01,180 --> 00:39:02,260
I don't care where you are,

521
00:39:02,260 --> 00:39:05,180
no matter what happens, I can't go.

522
00:39:05,180 --> 00:39:05,620
Please,

523
00:39:05,620 --> 00:39:06,660
as technology supervisor,

524
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,660
I'm not obliged to

525
00:39:07,660 --> 00:39:10,380
appearing at marketing exhibitions every day, right?

526
00:39:14,660 --> 00:39:15,460
Wait a minute.

527
00:39:31,860 --> 00:39:33,060
What are you doing?

528
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:35,660
This behavior of yours is called trespassing.

529
00:39:35,940 --> 00:39:36,860
Kalian ta...

530
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,900
Mr. Yang,

531
00:39:48,100 --> 00:39:49,700
why did you suddenly come here?

532
00:39:55,700 --> 00:39:57,700
What a reckless woman.

533
00:39:58,860 --> 00:40:02,540
It seems that this Ke Ying is not like a good person.

534
00:40:03,620 --> 00:40:08,820
How could a woman who once killed people be a good person?

535
00:40:12,180 --> 00:40:13,780
Others there is nothing to worry about.

536
00:40:14,500 --> 00:40:17,940
Just worried he could see something else in this,

537
00:40:18,900 --> 00:40:19,620
and add to the problem.

538
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,580
Thank You.

539
00:40:40,580 --> 00:40:41,300
You're welcome.

540
00:40:41,460 --> 00:40:43,380
If there's nothing else, I'll go busy first.

541
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,100
Good.

542
00:40:44,500 --> 00:40:45,580
- See you later. - See you later.

543
00:41:02,380 --> 00:41:02,860
How?

544
00:41:02,860 --> 00:41:03,820
What happened?

545
00:41:05,100 --> 00:41:08,060
This so-called American high-tech battery charging technology,

546
00:41:08,540 --> 00:41:10,700
is actually a combined product of various studies.

547
00:41:11,740 --> 00:41:12,540
It's easy,

548
00:41:12,820 --> 00:41:13,700
it's all fake.

549
00:41:15,940 --> 00:41:16,940
So, what are they after?

550
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:18,340
Just swindling funds?

551
00:41:31,700 --> 00:41:32,460
Mr. Feng,

552
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,460
did Wu contact you?

553
00:41:38,020 --> 00:41:39,060
Didn't contact you?

554
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,700
I've been back for two days,

555
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,060
but still haven't heard back.

556
00:41:51,460 --> 00:41:52,380
Wait a minute, yes.

557
00:41:58,660 --> 00:41:59,740
Isn't this Kak Qiang?

558
00:41:59,740 --> 00:42:00,780
Is Wu back yet?

559
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,220
No, not him.

560
00:42:08,420 --> 00:42:10,260
I'm at Wu's residence now.

561
00:42:12,820 --> 00:42:13,900
Fine, I know.

562
00:42:14,340 --> 00:42:15,340
I kept it a secret,

563
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:17,340
didn't dare to tell second uncle.

564
00:42:33,100 --> 00:42:34,220
Is Wu missing?

565
00:42:41,580 --> 00:42:42,620
What did you tell him to do?

566
00:42:45,820 --> 00:42:46,740
Seatbelt.

567
00:43:12,380 --> 00:43:13,220
Halo.

568
00:43:13,700 --> 00:43:14,460
Ke Ying.

569
00:43:15,140 --> 00:43:15,900
I know,

570
00:43:16,780 --> 00:43:19,940
although now saying all this, it may no longer be of any use.

571
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:24,860
However, I still want to tell you...

572
00:43:26,540 --> 00:43:27,380
sorry

573
00:43:29,740 --> 00:43:31,460
Previous problems...

574
00:43:35,860 --> 00:43:36,660
Ying?

575
00:43:37,380 --> 00:43:38,660
If there's nothing, I'll close it first.
