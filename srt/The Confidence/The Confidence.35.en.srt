=Episode 35=

3
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:31,260
Which has something to do with Feng Xiaosheng.

4
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:44,140
(Shen Shijie)

5
00:03:44,380 --> 00:03:46,540
(Date of birth)

00:03:46,700 --> 00:03:48,020
(Address)

00:03:49,180 --> 00:03:49,620
(Regional Identification Number)

8
00:04:26,460 --> 00:04:27,180
I understand.

9
00:04:27,860 --> 00:04:28,940
Don't show up these two days.

10
00:04:28,980 --> 00:04:29,900
Find a hiding place.

11
00:07:32,340 --> 00:07:33,380
Quickly wash your face, brush your teeth, change your clothes.

12
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:35,180
I'll take you out for breakfast later.

13
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:37,460
Fast.

14
00:07:49,380 --> 00:07:53,820
(Outpatient)

15
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:58,900
I give you a thumbs up.

16
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:01,100
Very good of you.

17
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:02,700
Feel it!

18
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:06,940
Midnight

19
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:08,860
even have a snack outside.

20
00:08:11,580 --> 00:08:12,780
I'm curious.

21
00:08:13,300 --> 00:08:14,380
Where did that devil come from?

22
00:08:14,780 --> 00:08:16,260
Why not kill you?

23
00:08:17,860 --> 00:08:19,060
If you die,

24
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:21,060
I would be very happy.

25
00:08:23,180 --> 00:08:24,020
Get lost.

26
00:08:25,700 --> 00:08:26,740
Get lost quickly.

27
00:08:27,020 --> 00:08:28,180
I don't want to.

28
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:29,620
What can you do to me?

29
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:34,460
Sister.

30
00:08:37,980 --> 00:08:39,130
Si... Brother.

31
00:08:41,980 --> 00:08:42,700
sister,

32
00:08:44,340 --> 00:08:45,580
aku melihat Shen Shijie.

33
00:08:51,620 --> 00:08:52,460
You talk carelessly.

34
00:08:52,940 --> 00:08:54,420
This is completely true.

35
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:57,260
I saw it again with my own eyes.

36
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,380
Second Uncle,

37
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:00,980
You are just surprised.

38
00:09:02,060 --> 00:09:03,060
Let go of your hand first.

39
00:09:03,820 --> 00:09:05,260
If there is a problem, speak slowly.

40
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:13,580
Second Aunt.

41
00:09:14,340 --> 00:09:16,300
Please take me to see the doctor in charge.

42
00:09:16,780 --> 00:09:19,300
Let's understand second uncle's condition again, shall we?

43
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:22,300
Good.

44
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,980
What really happened?

45
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:43,980
Tell me clearly.

46
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:46,900
Shen Shijie sudah kembali.

47
00:09:48,780 --> 00:09:50,740
Shen Shijie is really back.

48
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:16,700
- Chairman of the Board of Directors. - Chairman of the Board of Directors.

49
00:10:16,860 --> 00:10:17,860
Sit down, everyone sit down.

50
00:10:22,180 --> 00:10:23,700
Regarding the Aoxin car factory,

51
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:25,620
Let Changjun handle it.

52
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:28,420
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

53
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:30,460
Supervisor Yuan.

54
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:33,740
All company funds are currently frozen.

55
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:35,300
Can only enter, cannot exit.

56
00:10:35,500 --> 00:10:36,100
Besides that,

57
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,940
Organize the details of this month's transactions, then deliver them to my office.

58
00:10:41,420 --> 00:10:41,980
Good.

59
00:10:44,980 --> 00:10:46,020
Don't just sit still.

60
00:10:46,940 --> 00:10:47,820
Dissolve.

61
00:10:48,740 --> 00:10:49,940
Fund freeze?

62
00:10:50,020 --> 00:10:50,700
Frozen?

63
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:52,620
So, our project is half way done...

64
00:11:08,860 --> 00:11:09,740
What did you say?

65
00:11:10,940 --> 00:11:13,100
Itu...Sheng adalah Shen Shijie?

66
00:11:13,620 --> 00:11:14,420
Correct.

67
00:11:16,380 --> 00:11:17,860
The current Sheng

68
00:11:19,180 --> 00:11:21,180
is Shen Shijie who has changed his skin.

69
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:25,340
Shen Shijie tidak mati.

70
00:11:26,460 --> 00:11:28,860
The dead one is Sheng.

71
00:11:28,860 --> 00:11:30,180
You... you let me digest it.

72
00:11:32,260 --> 00:11:33,100
Shen...

73
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,340
Shen Shijie tidak mati,

74
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:37,420
Sheng is dead?

75
00:11:38,460 --> 00:11:39,340
The current Sheng

76
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:42,220
was Shen Shijie in disguise?

77
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,580
Jadi, Sheng mati menggantikan Shen Shijie?

78
00:11:54,460 --> 00:11:56,300
Sheng has a terminal illness.

79
00:11:58,060 --> 00:11:59,420
He died of illness.

80
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:01,620
Not...

81
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:06,500
Then, who was Shen Shijie who was shot dead by the police?

82
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,740
The old driver Sheng.

83
00:12:13,860 --> 00:12:14,620
Two?

84
00:12:20,060 --> 00:12:21,700
What is this?

85
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:24,620
Sis, your brain has been eaten by dogs, hasn't it?

86
00:12:24,620 --> 00:12:26,660
Why do you think this way?

87
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:30,060
Doesn't this bring the wolves in?

88
00:12:31,020 --> 00:12:32,940
Sheng's body had already collapsed,

89
00:12:34,340 --> 00:12:35,500
can't stand it anymore.

90
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,900
However, the company...

91
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,980
can't collapse yet.

92
00:12:42,220 --> 00:12:42,700
no,

93
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:45,740
You... if you don't want the company to collapse,

94
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:47,660
You... you just call Ruichi home.

95
00:12:48,140 --> 00:12:48,700
Right, right?

96
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:51,860
Isn't Ruichi also surnamed Feng? He is your biological nephew.

97
00:12:52,540 --> 00:12:52,900
True, or not?

98
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:54,540
You just hand over the company to him, right?

99
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:56,380
Why do you have to bring in outsiders?

100
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:58,020
You... you actually brought the wolves in.

101
00:12:58,180 --> 00:12:59,140
What do you know?

102
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:03,140
The company cannot do without Sheng.

103
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:05,940
what do you think,

104
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:10,140
I don't want to hand over the company to Ruichi?

105
00:13:12,100 --> 00:13:12,900
At the beginning of the year,

106
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,820
the company is that big,

107
00:13:16,100 --> 00:13:17,060
for the sake of what?

108
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,660
Isn't it for the sake of seeing?

109
00:13:19,780 --> 00:13:20,700
without Sheng,

110
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,020
can the company survive?

111
00:13:25,140 --> 00:13:26,140
However, the end?

112
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:28,380
Sheng recently stepped down from his post,

113
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:30,300
company shares

114
00:13:30,500 --> 00:13:32,100
immediately dropped dozens of points,

115
00:13:32,940 --> 00:13:34,020
worth tens of billions.

116
00:13:34,860 --> 00:13:36,020
Totally freediving.

117
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:42,860
The reputation of this Feng Group,

118
00:13:43,780 --> 00:13:45,460
Sheng built it.

119
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:47,780
Without him,

120
00:13:49,580 --> 00:13:51,580
This reputation will collapse.

121
00:13:52,780 --> 00:13:54,260
Can't you find someone else?

122
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:56,700
Why look for some kind of Shen Shijie?

123
00:13:57,820 --> 00:13:58,660
Hi there,

124
00:13:58,820 --> 00:14:01,620
isn't Hai's stature similar to Sheng?

125
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:03,700
Isn't he more reliable than Shen Shijie?

126
00:14:04,180 --> 00:14:05,780
Hai's body appearance is indeed similar,

127
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:07,900
but the looks

128
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,780
different too much from Sheng.

129
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,860
After all, that brain,

130
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,100
can it be used?

131
00:14:16,460 --> 00:14:18,340
Shen Shijie's brain can indeed be used,

132
00:14:18,460 --> 00:14:19,540
but does he obey you?

133
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:22,220
Now he wants to kill me,

134
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:23,980
do you know when he will harm you?

135
00:14:33,100 --> 00:14:33,860
Where are you going?

136
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,380
I will kill that Shen Shijie.

137
00:14:35,380 --> 00:14:36,260
Stop!

138
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:38,020
Sis,

139
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:40,180
This Shen Shijie is already going to kill us.

140
00:14:40,180 --> 00:14:41,260
What else do you doubt?

141
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,180
Do you really consider him your biological son?

142
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:44,980
He must die,

143
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:47,820
but now is not the time.

144
00:14:48,100 --> 00:14:50,420
If now is not the time, then when is the time?

145
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:03,380
After our money and our people are all out.

146
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:05,620
At the time,

147
00:15:07,100 --> 00:15:13,300
then we submit the evidence that Sheng is Shen Shijie to the police station.

148
00:15:14,940 --> 00:15:15,620
Automatically,

149
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:18,380
someone will help us...

150
00:15:20,740 --> 00:15:21,540
kill him.

151
00:15:42,940 --> 00:15:44,500
(Financial Supervisor's Office)

152
00:15:50,940 --> 00:15:51,500
Halo.

153
00:15:53,660 --> 00:15:54,380
I'm telling you,

154
00:15:54,740 --> 00:15:56,660
The chairman of the crew must already know about our transfer pricing.

155
00:15:56,940 --> 00:15:58,700
He asked me to show him the details of this month.

156
00:15:58,860 --> 00:15:59,540
How about this?

157
00:16:00,180 --> 00:16:01,180
What are you panicking about?

158
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,500
I didn't panic.

159
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:08,700
It's just, how do I show him these details?

160
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,620
We'll just do what he wants,

161
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:15,900
of?

162
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,140
Good.

163
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:21,940
Don't be afraid.

164
00:16:22,820 --> 00:16:24,220
Even though the sky is falling,

165
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:25,940
there is still a big boss who will restrain him.

166
00:16:26,940 --> 00:16:27,820
Chairman of the board of directors

167
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,260
will not be kind to his biological father.

168
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:32,860
Good.

169
00:16:33,380 --> 00:16:34,220
I understand.

170
00:16:55,140 --> 00:16:56,420
Hello, Beautiful Girl.

171
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,100
Come on, eat together.

172
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,140
I don't have time.

173
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,340
In that case,

174
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,020
just eat in the company canteen.

175
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:06,020
I have something to do later, I want to go out.

176
00:17:06,540 --> 00:17:07,500
I can't go home this afternoon.

177
00:17:09,570 --> 00:17:10,540
If so, you should be busy first.

178
00:17:10,740 --> 00:17:12,050
I'll treat you tonight, okay?

179
00:17:12,810 --> 00:17:13,940
I'll just contact you later.

180
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,090
Okay.

181
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:23,660
He said he had business this afternoon,

182
00:17:23,660 --> 00:17:24,570
want to go out for a while.

183
00:17:25,460 --> 00:17:26,780
If so, monitor it more closely.

184
00:17:27,540 --> 00:17:28,140
Good.

185
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,420
Wait a minute.

186
00:17:34,220 --> 00:17:34,980
I'm coming too.

187
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:40,500
I'll go with Wu.

188
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:44,620
This is not his field,

189
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:47,020
He couldn't tell the difference between a genuine or fake transaction journal.

190
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,940
I'm afraid he was lied to.

191
00:18:00,100 --> 00:18:00,900
Be careful.

192
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:36,780
(Feng-Fuyong Holding Company)

193
00:18:36,780 --> 00:18:38,500
Second uncle was beaten black and blue,

194
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:40,540
also shocked to the point of fear.

195
00:18:40,780 --> 00:18:42,540
He kept screaming saying there was a devil.

196
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,420
He wouldn't go there without a reason.

197
00:18:51,300 --> 00:18:52,980
He must have gone looking for things.

198
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:57,380
You Qiang's office was thoroughly ransacked.

199
00:18:58,300 --> 00:18:59,860
When Pi Ku and the others chased him,

200
00:18:59,860 --> 00:19:02,300
vaguely saw him carrying a heavy bag.

201
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,380
I don't know what's in it.

202
00:19:10,180 --> 00:19:11,700
This morning he looked very happy.

203
00:19:12,940 --> 00:19:14,660
He should have gotten the item he wanted.

204
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:17,940
The item that You Qiang used to threaten her?

205
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,060
About what is that?

206
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:29,780
The bag is heavy...

207
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:37,860
(Transfer receipt)

208
00:19:42,420 --> 00:19:44,180
(Transfer receipt)

209
00:20:12,540 --> 00:20:13,220
Wang,

210
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,060
I have something to do, I'll be out for a bit.

211
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:16,660
Later, if someone is looking for me,

212
00:20:16,860 --> 00:20:18,220
ask them to come here after 15.00.

213
00:20:18,260 --> 00:20:19,020
Yes, Supervisor Yuan.

214
00:20:35,780 --> 00:20:36,980
After he took the items,

215
00:20:37,460 --> 00:20:38,780
definitely have to find a place to hide it.

216
00:20:39,180 --> 00:20:41,060
You look for an opportunity to search his residence.

217
00:20:42,780 --> 00:20:44,060
He cares so much about this thing,

218
00:20:44,060 --> 00:20:45,060
This is definitely not an ordinary item.

219
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:46,500
May be

220
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:48,540
can find clues or evidence.

221
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:50,980
In his house there is a secret room.

222
00:20:52,780 --> 00:20:53,700
Secret room?

223
00:20:54,420 --> 00:20:56,140
He didn't sleep in the room at night.

224
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:57,460
So where do you sleep?

225
00:20:57,540 --> 00:20:58,620
Sleeping in a secret room?

226
00:21:10,020 --> 00:21:13,780
Do you still remember the bookshelf attached to the wall of his book room?

227
00:21:15,180 --> 00:21:15,780
Remember.

228
00:21:16,300 --> 00:21:18,220
The secret room must be behind that bookshelf.

229
00:21:19,260 --> 00:21:20,300
Or perhaps to be precise,

230
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,220
it could be a set of adjoining apartments

231
00:21:22,940 --> 00:21:24,300
the middle part of which is connected.

232
00:21:31,540 --> 00:21:32,300
Already out.

233
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:35,220
(China Construction Bank)

234
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,860
He keeps a journal of his transactions

235
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:40,780
in a bank vault?

236
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,860
Haven't you already searched your home and office?

237
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:44,940
Not found.

238
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,740
If so, it should be kept outside.

239
00:22:47,780 --> 00:22:49,020
Who was sent?

240
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:49,540
Gang?

241
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,420
Aren't you?

242
00:22:53,460 --> 00:22:54,180
Not me.

243
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:00,380
In that case,

244
00:23:00,380 --> 00:23:02,300
there is one more mysterious person who is his accomplice.

245
00:23:05,020 --> 00:23:06,460
Someone who can help him kill people.

246
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:09,060
The person who killed You Qiang.

247
00:23:14,540 --> 00:23:15,540
Could it be Hua Zi?

248
00:23:16,060 --> 00:23:16,660
Impossible.

249
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:18,780
Hua Zi's guts weren't this big.

250
00:23:19,620 --> 00:23:20,620
There must be others.

251
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:24,780
Already out.

252
00:23:36,020 --> 00:23:36,500
I'm going there.

253
00:23:47,020 --> 00:23:47,500
It's me.

254
00:23:47,860 --> 00:23:48,860
You startled me!

255
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,500
What do you want to do?

256
00:23:53,340 --> 00:23:54,660
I should be the one asking that, right?

257
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,900
What are you doing?

258
00:23:59,300 --> 00:24:00,420
What is hidden in that suitcase?

259
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,460
You interfere too much.

260
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,380
I understand.

261
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:11,940
You come close to me,

262
00:24:12,460 --> 00:24:14,140
for the sake of the item in my hand, right?

263
00:24:17,820 --> 00:24:19,940
From the start you were never sincerely nice to me!

264
00:24:22,140 --> 00:24:23,940
You approach me in every way,

265
00:24:24,140 --> 00:24:25,180
makes me happy,

266
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,620
all for the sake of the document in my hand.

267
00:24:27,020 --> 00:24:28,460
You are the chairman of the board of directors' confidant!

268
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,140
Kak Fenfang...

269
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,380
Don't call me sister. Shut your mouth!

270
00:24:33,580 --> 00:24:34,060
Okay.

271
00:24:35,380 --> 00:24:36,180
Yuan Fenfang,

272
00:24:39,300 --> 00:24:39,940
I admit,

273
00:24:40,380 --> 00:24:41,420
my goal is to approach you...

274
00:24:42,260 --> 00:24:43,300
it's not pure.

275
00:24:43,780 --> 00:24:45,140
I never really liked you either,

276
00:24:45,620 --> 00:24:47,940
but now I sincerely want to save your life.

277
00:24:52,020 --> 00:24:53,340
Transaction journal in your suitcase

278
00:24:53,700 --> 00:24:55,580
you want to hand it over to Big Boss Feng, right?

279
00:24:57,260 --> 00:24:59,100
Do you think, after you give them this transaction journal,

280
00:25:00,380 --> 00:25:02,140
they will leave you this living proof?

281
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:06,580
Impossible.

282
00:25:07,620 --> 00:25:08,820
There is only one consequence.

283
00:25:09,500 --> 00:25:10,860
They will kill you to silence you,

284
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:13,060
then makes it seem like you ran away to avoid punishment.

285
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:23,340
You think what you said was funny, don't you?

286
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,620
Do you think it's possible?

287
00:25:26,580 --> 00:25:28,380
Maybe or not, you yourself know best.

288
00:25:30,700 --> 00:25:31,460
Kak Fenfang,

289
00:25:32,140 --> 00:25:33,820
you've been in the Feng Group for so long,

290
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,020
that you have heard and seen

291
00:25:36,220 --> 00:25:37,220
it shouldn't be small either.

292
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,820
You've heard about the car factory being burned down, right?

293
00:25:44,060 --> 00:25:46,100
You've heard about the car exploding at the mall, right?

294
00:25:46,940 --> 00:25:47,820
That's my car.

295
00:25:48,780 --> 00:25:49,900
Master Feng gave it to me.

296
00:25:50,820 --> 00:25:52,420
Do you know who was burned in that car?

297
00:25:53,860 --> 00:25:56,180
The person who helped second uncle burn down the car factory.

298
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:58,500
The goal is to kill to silence.

299
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:01,380
I know,

300
00:26:01,660 --> 00:26:04,140
My intention to approach you before was not sincere.

301
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:05,700
However, after getting close,

302
00:26:05,700 --> 00:26:07,060
I realize you're a good person,

303
00:26:07,060 --> 00:26:07,820
your heart is good.

304
00:26:09,340 --> 00:26:10,460
This matter is not this simple.

305
00:26:10,940 --> 00:26:11,900
You listen to my advice.

306
00:26:11,900 --> 00:26:13,260
Quickly release the item in your hand.

307
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:15,700
Don't worry about others,

308
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:17,140
hide for some time.

309
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:18,820
Listen to me.

310
00:26:20,140 --> 00:26:21,100
Wu, Wu.

311
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,420
Wu, you know that.

312
00:26:24,420 --> 00:26:25,900
The big boss will definitely not kill me.

313
00:26:26,340 --> 00:26:27,140
Have you forgotten?

314
00:26:27,500 --> 00:26:28,700
He is my savior.

315
00:26:29,420 --> 00:26:30,420
He used his money

316
00:26:30,420 --> 00:26:31,420
to teach me

317
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,420
Because of that,

318
00:26:32,700 --> 00:26:34,580
I can be different from village girls in general.

319
00:26:34,980 --> 00:26:35,900
I'm not for sale,

320
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,940
not exchanged as someone else's wife from my brother,

321
00:26:38,620 --> 00:26:39,980
there is only the current Yuan Fenfang.

322
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,180
Sis Fenfang, you listen to me.

323
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:42,580
Big Boss Feng, they all pretend to be nice.

324
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:44,340
How many people did he hurt?

325
00:26:44,940 --> 00:26:46,420
All his money was covered in other people's blood.

326
00:26:46,580 --> 00:26:47,740
How much you did for her,

327
00:26:47,900 --> 00:26:48,980
including illegal things,

328
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,380
Is all this still not enough to repay the favor?

329
00:26:50,660 --> 00:26:52,700
Do you have to give up your life first, then you can repay this favor?

330
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:04,980
Kak Fenfang,

331
00:27:06,100 --> 00:27:06,820
run away quickly.

332
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:09,980
Don't let their people find you.

333
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:16,220
Wu.

334
00:27:16,980 --> 00:27:17,900
Wu!

335
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:28,380
I really didn't do anything.

336
00:27:28,820 --> 00:27:29,380
Don't kill me.

337
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:33,100
Don't kill me.

338
00:27:51,460 --> 00:27:52,260
Quickly take a look.

339
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:01,780
(Income and Expenditure Details)

340
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:16,580
(Income and Expenditure Details)

341
00:28:20,940 --> 00:28:21,500
How?

342
00:28:22,620 --> 00:28:23,860
That's right, this is it.

343
00:28:24,940 --> 00:28:25,540
I'm grateful.

344
00:28:25,820 --> 00:28:26,300
Ayo.

345
00:28:27,020 --> 00:28:27,860
Go to the police station first,

346
00:28:28,700 --> 00:28:29,700
leave this to Captain Xiao.

347
00:28:30,020 --> 00:28:31,020
Given this evidence,

348
00:28:31,540 --> 00:28:33,220
enough to catch Feng Xiaosheng and Big Boss Feng.

349
00:28:34,220 --> 00:28:35,260
Let them be interrogated slowly.

350
00:28:35,740 --> 00:28:36,260
Wait.

351
00:28:38,980 --> 00:28:40,460
With this transaction journal as proof,

352
00:28:41,060 --> 00:28:43,100
the investigative team can be candid

353
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,500
went into Feng's company to investigate,

354
00:28:45,340 --> 00:28:47,060
froze the Feng family's bank account,

355
00:28:47,700 --> 00:28:50,060
and stop all related transactions.

356
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:51,900
However...

357
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,340
What do you mean?

358
00:28:55,580 --> 00:28:57,260
Big Boss Feng retired long ago.

359
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,620
Feng Xiaosheng

360
00:28:58,620 --> 00:28:59,940
only bears the name of the chairman of the board of directors.

361
00:29:01,020 --> 00:29:03,500
The subject of corporate law, the CEO is Wang Changjun.

362
00:29:03,780 --> 00:29:05,300
Official public company

363
00:29:05,300 --> 00:29:06,820
accountable by the legal subject.

364
00:29:07,620 --> 00:29:08,540
financial fraud,

365
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:11,660
even though they meet the requirements of criminal liability,

366
00:29:12,660 --> 00:29:13,700
but that will be investigated

367
00:29:13,700 --> 00:29:15,260
only the person directly responsible.

368
00:29:16,540 --> 00:29:17,300
For example finance,

369
00:29:18,740 --> 00:29:19,540
CEO,

370
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:20,780
and related accountants.

371
00:29:23,860 --> 00:29:24,380
That...

372
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:26,140
why is it like this?

373
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:28,660
So, now what should we do?

374
00:29:32,340 --> 00:29:33,540
Hand over the transaction journal to Feng Xiaosheng,

375
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,060
let them fight each other.

376
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:41,620
You still feel revenge

377
00:29:42,540 --> 00:29:44,020
more important than stopping

378
00:29:44,300 --> 00:29:45,100
funds rushed out?

379
00:29:48,060 --> 00:29:49,060
If you insist on thinking like that,

380
00:29:49,740 --> 00:29:50,660
I can't do anything either.

381
00:29:52,780 --> 00:29:53,540
Let's make it like this,

382
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:56,100
we combine our two thoughts.

383
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:57,900
This transaction journal...

384
00:29:58,380 --> 00:29:59,620
want to hand it over to the investigation team,

385
00:30:00,180 --> 00:30:01,340
also want to hand it over to Feng Xiaosheng.

386
00:30:02,740 --> 00:30:04,060
The transaction journal is only one copy,

387
00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:05,620
where are you looking?

388
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,780
You're stupid, aren't you?

389
00:30:08,980 --> 00:30:09,540
Ayo.

390
00:30:11,020 --> 00:30:12,180
That's right, photocopy.

391
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,220
It's stupid.

392
00:30:31,860 --> 00:30:33,220
The contents of this transaction journal are sensitive,

393
00:30:33,980 --> 00:30:35,220
You go in first and see the situation.

394
00:30:36,220 --> 00:30:36,900
Ask the boss,

395
00:30:36,900 --> 00:30:37,860
Can we photocopy it ourselves?

396
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:39,620
You can pay more.

397
00:30:40,100 --> 00:30:40,780
Good.

398
00:31:07,220 --> 00:31:07,700
Stop!

399
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:23,340
Halo.

400
00:31:24,020 --> 00:31:24,940
No, what are you doing?

401
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:27,580
In order to avoid suspicion,

402
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:29,460
Temporary transaction journals may not be provided to the investigative team.

403
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:32,220
You just say fine to me, why do you use this method?

404
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,820
I told you all right,

405
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:34,660
you don't want to hear.

406
00:31:36,060 --> 00:31:36,500
You...

407
00:31:37,420 --> 00:31:38,740
Ke Ying, listen to me.

408
00:31:39,700 --> 00:31:41,420
You just gave the transaction journal to Feng Xiaosheng,

409
00:31:41,420 --> 00:31:42,620
what if he destroys it?

410
00:31:44,860 --> 00:31:46,420
Wasn't your idea a good one?

411
00:31:46,780 --> 00:31:47,980
Although not handed over to Captain Xiao,

412
00:31:48,660 --> 00:31:50,100
we can also keep it ourselves.

413
00:31:52,980 --> 00:31:54,460
Ke Ying, speak.

414
00:31:58,860 --> 00:32:00,780
What do you think Feng Xiaosheng is up to us?

415
00:32:06,180 --> 00:32:07,220
I can't take any more risks.

416
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,300
Unless I'm sure I can finish him in one attack.

417
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,060
Ke Ying.

418
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:12,420
Don't talk nonsense anymore.

419
00:32:13,420 --> 00:32:15,140
You call Feng Xiaosheng and complain about me.

420
00:32:15,980 --> 00:32:18,060
Just say I took the transaction journal away from you.

421
00:32:19,060 --> 00:32:19,660
Why?

422
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:21,940
According to you?

423
00:32:24,340 --> 00:32:25,460
Hello, Ke Ying.

424
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:26,820
Halo!

425
00:32:42,660 --> 00:32:43,820
Hello, Wu.

426
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:44,660
Kak Sheng,

427
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:46,380
Ke Ying took away the transaction journal.

428
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:52,060
(Sorry, the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

429
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:52,700
How?

430
00:32:54,780 --> 00:32:55,740
Still can't be contacted?

431
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:58,620
(Sorry, the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

432
00:32:58,620 --> 00:32:59,620
It's no longer active.

433
00:33:02,700 --> 00:33:03,540
Not active?

434
00:33:05,980 --> 00:33:06,900
He ran away?

435
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,060
What about the transaction journal?

436
00:33:14,900 --> 00:33:15,860
Logically,

437
00:33:16,900 --> 00:33:19,180
Yuan Fenfang's guts weren't that big.

438
00:33:21,660 --> 00:33:22,820
Did something happen to him?

439
00:33:26,420 --> 00:33:27,180
Find him.

440
00:33:29,780 --> 00:33:30,980
If you live, there must be someone.

441
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,940
If you die, there must be a body!

442
00:34:04,860 --> 00:34:05,940
Just leave me alone.

443
00:34:08,020 --> 00:34:09,380
I can do it myself.

444
00:34:44,860 --> 00:34:45,580
When.

445
00:34:46,420 --> 00:34:47,780
Grandpa and grandmother have gone home.

446
00:34:51,100 --> 00:34:51,740
I understand.

447
00:34:52,650 --> 00:34:53,540
You don't have to watch anymore.

448
00:34:54,210 --> 00:34:54,780
Come back.

449
00:35:07,340 --> 00:35:09,260
Mom, that alley looks scary.

450
00:35:09,380 --> 00:35:10,540
actually he is a very good person.

451
00:35:11,180 --> 00:35:12,060
Ying Ying,

452
00:35:12,060 --> 00:35:14,380
I know he's a pretty good guy,

453
00:35:14,620 --> 00:35:15,220
But...

454
00:35:15,460 --> 00:35:17,540
me and your father have no freedom at all.

455
00:35:18,580 --> 00:35:19,580
A day to go anywhere

456
00:35:19,580 --> 00:35:20,820
there is always someone following.

457
00:35:21,460 --> 00:35:23,260
What is this really about?

458
00:35:24,100 --> 00:35:26,500
Isn't someone spreading rumors about Lian Lian and Feng Xiaosheng?

459
00:35:26,700 --> 00:35:28,060
Many gossip reporters are watching.

460
00:35:28,340 --> 00:35:29,780
They are also for your safety.

461
00:35:31,860 --> 00:35:32,780
There's your father,

462
00:35:32,780 --> 00:35:34,140
Mothers do not need to be protected by others.

463
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:38,020
Hurry and ask Tuan Feng

464
00:35:38,380 --> 00:35:40,260
banish this grim-faced god, yes.

465
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,380
Ya, ya, ya.

466
00:35:44,780 --> 00:35:45,740
I'll tell Xiaosheng.

467
00:35:45,740 --> 00:35:47,060
In a few days he will be told to leave.

468
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,100
Already, yes, I closed it first. Drugs.

469
00:35:55,940 --> 00:35:56,660
It's done.

470
00:36:10,900 --> 00:36:12,660
You... you're crazy, aren't you?

471
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:28,620
Just this?

472
00:36:31,500 --> 00:36:32,580
Just this?

473
00:36:34,140 --> 00:36:35,860
The value is at least 5 billion,

474
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:37,260
maybe even more.

475
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:42,380
Five billion?

476
00:36:44,020 --> 00:36:44,620
Really?

477
00:36:45,540 --> 00:36:46,900
As long as you hand it over to the police,

478
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:50,060
all of Big Boss Feng's plans would be in vain.

479
00:36:51,300 --> 00:36:53,620
Assets worth tens of billions of yuan will not be able to get out.

480
00:36:55,980 --> 00:36:56,980
You think it's worth it, don't you?

481
00:37:06,500 --> 00:37:07,100
Okay,

482
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:09,820
now all my work is done.

483
00:37:12,300 --> 00:37:13,860
Now it depends on how much money you can get

484
00:37:13,860 --> 00:37:14,980
you got it from Big Boss Feng.

485
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,540
I told you, yeah.

486
00:37:21,460 --> 00:37:22,380
I don't want to work for free,

487
00:37:22,620 --> 00:37:23,460
I have to get a part.

488
00:37:23,860 --> 00:37:24,780
At least 10 percent.

489
00:37:44,140 --> 00:37:47,020
Why don't you take this and meet Big Boss Feng?

490
00:37:48,940 --> 00:37:50,340
You can't just earn money.

491
00:37:51,980 --> 00:37:53,940
Can also get proof that you are Shen Shijie,

492
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,100
true, right?

493
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:02,900
To be honest,

494
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:04,100
I also do not know.

495
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,580
Maybe...

496
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,140
I'm really sick.

497
00:38:14,140 --> 00:38:14,820
What disease?

498
00:38:19,980 --> 00:38:20,980
Sometimes,

499
00:38:20,980 --> 00:38:22,780
it's good not to ask too deeply,

500
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:27,100
leave a little face for others.

501
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:28,780
Good.

502
00:38:44,100 --> 00:38:44,900
Why?

503
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,420
Wu is ratting me out again, huh?

504
00:38:55,420 --> 00:38:56,620
Why did you leave him?

505
00:39:01,140 --> 00:39:02,020
Do you want me to speak honestly?

506
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,780
I don't believe it.

507
00:39:07,420 --> 00:39:08,820
I'm afraid he's a police spy.

508
00:39:13,380 --> 00:39:14,140
You two,

509
00:39:15,900 --> 00:39:17,060
look down on each other.

510
00:39:42,540 --> 00:39:44,100
Si Ke Ying is very smart.

511
00:39:45,100 --> 00:39:47,060
The more you don't get along with him,

512
00:39:47,980 --> 00:39:50,020
Feng Xiaosheng will be less suspicious of the two of you.

513
00:39:52,060 --> 00:39:53,140
This woman...

514
00:39:54,060 --> 00:39:55,260
his hidden intentions are too many.

515
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:59,100
Sacrificing friends at important times was not discussed at all.

516
00:40:01,460 --> 00:40:03,620
I really don't know when he will betray me again.

517
00:40:08,380 --> 00:40:09,660
If so, be careful.

518
00:40:17,540 --> 00:40:18,860
What about the transaction journal?

519
00:40:21,540 --> 00:40:22,620
What Ke Ying said was true.

520
00:40:22,940 --> 00:40:25,100
Feng Xiaosheng would not just destroy the transaction journal.

521
00:40:25,780 --> 00:40:27,940
He would just use it to blackmail Big Boss Feng.

522
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:40,860
This is Ke Ying's true goal.

523
00:40:43,620 --> 00:40:45,300
He wanted to provoke Big Boss Feng,

524
00:40:45,300 --> 00:40:47,620
to completely break with Feng Xiaosheng.

525
00:40:49,620 --> 00:40:50,300
Kapten Xiao,

526
00:40:51,860 --> 00:40:53,140
what do you think Feng Xiaosheng is

527
00:40:54,100 --> 00:40:55,660
sungguhan Shen Shijie?

528
00:40:57,620 --> 00:40:58,620
This needs proof.

529
00:41:06,740 --> 00:41:07,940
Proof.

530
00:41:08,980 --> 00:41:10,180
Proof.

531
00:41:16,620 --> 00:41:17,540
I really didn't think of it

532
00:41:17,540 --> 00:41:19,620
what evidence can prove that Feng Xiaosheng

533
00:41:20,140 --> 00:41:21,300
adalah Shen Shijie.

534
00:41:22,780 --> 00:41:23,620
I'll look into it.

535
00:41:49,580 --> 00:41:51,260
I suggest not going to the Feng family's old residence.

536
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:53,380
Take Big Boss Feng to meet you outside.

537
00:41:54,620 --> 00:41:55,300
I know.

538
00:42:02,420 --> 00:42:03,420
Is it only necessary that Wu go?

539
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:04,780
Does the Gang not have to go?

540
00:42:05,060 --> 00:42:05,660
No need.

541
00:42:07,940 --> 00:42:08,900
Where do you like to go?

542
00:42:14,140 --> 00:42:15,060
After I get the money,

543
00:42:16,140 --> 00:42:17,340
I'll take you to live abroad.

544
00:42:21,620 --> 00:42:22,820
If you have enough money,

545
00:42:24,300 --> 00:42:25,660
I want to go to Panama and buy an island.

546
00:42:28,820 --> 00:42:29,340
Good.
