00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 31=

3
00:01:56,060 --> 00:02:00,220
(Emergency Installation)

4
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,060
Grandma Chen

5
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:09,980
It is okay, right?

6
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:11,820
His mood just stabilized,

7
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,780
already asleep.

8
00:02:16,900 --> 00:02:18,500
Does Ke Ying already know your identity?

9
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:21,860
Maybe you've already guessed a bit.

10
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,380
Today's problem

11
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:31,420
it's really confusing.

12
00:02:33,580 --> 00:02:34,700
What did Miao Miao say?

13
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:36,700
What could he say?

14
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,020
He said he worked at the club,

15
00:02:39,020 --> 00:02:40,180
don't know anything other than that.

16
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:42,340
this child,

17
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:44,740
makes me so angry I want to hit him!

18
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,980
Really good at making trouble!

19
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:47,140
That's it.

20
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:50,580
Who told Ke Ying?

21
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:52,740
People named Yu Chengbo,

22
00:02:53,220 --> 00:02:54,340
teman Miao Miao,

23
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:56,740
is also a student in Ke Ying's class.

24
00:02:57,580 --> 00:02:58,740
He couldn't contact Miao Miao,

25
00:02:59,020 --> 00:03:01,340
then heard Feng Xiaosheng take Miao Miao away,

26
00:03:01,740 --> 00:03:03,340
so panicked, he immediately contacted Ke Ying.

27
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,140
Halo.

28
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:20,060
Fine, I understand.

29
00:03:22,700 --> 00:03:23,900
Ke Ying had returned to her house.

30
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:26,140
Judging from today's situation,

31
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:28,140
Ke Ying will be in danger.

32
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,980
You guys should send someone to protect him.

33
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:32,060
Don't worry, I'll arrange it.

34
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:33,180
Good.

35
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:36,700
Don't just intervene.

36
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:39,260
Today something so unlucky happened,

37
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:42,460
perhaps Feng Xiaosheng will also suspect you.

38
00:03:43,140 --> 00:03:44,180
You should be more careful.

39
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:47,540
Besides that,

40
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:50,540
You don't need to worry too much about Ke Ying.

41
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:52,460
Currently Feng Xiaosheng

42
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:53,860
still didn't dare to do anything to Ke Ying.

43
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,300
Good.

44
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:17,700
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

45
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:20,300
This is the schedule for the next three days.

46
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:22,380
There were some clashes at times,

47
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:24,300
We have tried to coordinate.

48
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,860
Chairman of the Board of Directors, the coffee is ready.

49
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:34,740
There are still some special adjustments

50
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:36,180
which you have to decide for yourself.

51
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,940
Charity banquet tomorrow night,

52
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:42,820
the invitation was sent a month ago,

53
00:04:43,660 --> 00:04:45,100
and continue to wait for your reply.

54
00:04:53,700 --> 00:04:54,820
Just take this cup of coffee with you.

55
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:56,780
He's been on business lately, won't come.

56
00:05:26,300 --> 00:05:28,860
The one surnamed Ke has brought the police

57
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,900
looking up to the club.

58
00:05:33,540 --> 00:05:34,420
Interesting.

59
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:36,180
Interesting.

60
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:39,980
We haven't had time to do anything here yet,

61
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:45,300
they themselves were apparently divided.

62
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:50,620
It's like, God

63
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,020
still on our side.

64
00:05:57,180 --> 00:05:58,980
How is he worthy of fighting you?

65
00:05:59,940 --> 00:06:01,500
The difference is huge.

66
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,940
However, people who...

67
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,980
principled must take revenge,

68
00:06:09,060 --> 00:06:12,300
he just let the woman go?

69
00:06:13,540 --> 00:06:15,220
Meanwhile there has been no action taken.

70
00:06:15,500 --> 00:06:17,020
Anyway, just reported it to the police.

71
00:06:18,220 --> 00:06:19,620
That shouldn't be the case either.

72
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,180
Oh yes.

73
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:24,740
That person,

74
00:06:25,020 --> 00:06:25,500
these two days,

75
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:27,820
quite close to Deputy Mayor Lian's daughter.

76
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,660
They really are

77
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,220
are you attracted to each other?

78
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:38,020
Nope

79
00:06:38,620 --> 00:06:40,460
deliberately made for us to see, right?

80
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:43,620
Nope.

81
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:46,180
This matter was arranged very thoroughly.

82
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:48,660
Lian Lian was certain

83
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:50,100
it was done by his enemy.

84
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:52,660
Will not associate it with us.

85
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:56,100
Then, what about Ke Ying?

86
00:06:57,820 --> 00:06:58,660
How was the response?

87
00:07:01,300 --> 00:07:02,180
Strange.

88
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:05,900
He had no response at all,

89
00:07:06,220 --> 00:07:07,900
don't even go to the company anymore,

90
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,540
have returned to work on campus.

91
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,020
Mr. Feng,

92
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:13,540
just had acupuncture,

93
00:07:13,660 --> 00:07:15,020
Qi and blood are not yet stable,

94
00:07:15,420 --> 00:07:17,900
Don't get too emotional, okay?

95
00:07:18,100 --> 00:07:19,060
Fine.

96
00:07:19,900 --> 00:07:20,740
Not emotional.

97
00:07:21,420 --> 00:07:22,220
Not emotional.

98
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:24,340
You are careful, yes.

99
00:07:32,060 --> 00:07:32,820
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

100
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:35,460
According to you, is it necessary?

101
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:39,740
did something to that person surnamed Ke?

102
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:45,660
interview script,

103
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:47,100
I've handed it over to Secretary An.

104
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,340
I hope you can check it out

105
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:50,540
in the midst of your busyness.

106
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:52,860
So that no errors occur,

107
00:07:53,020 --> 00:07:54,660
then said that I cheated you.

108
00:07:57,460 --> 00:07:58,500
Heaven knows.

109
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:00,380
I just admire you,

110
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:01,540
there is no prejudice whatsoever.

111
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,020
Good.

112
00:08:05,260 --> 00:08:06,780
Contact me anytime if there is a problem.

113
00:08:38,300 --> 00:08:39,300
Really serious?

114
00:08:39,770 --> 00:08:40,890
Until you forget the time.

115
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,180
Pretending not to be familiar with me.

116
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,900
That's enough, okay?

117
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:54,060
No need to think of ways to fool me anymore.

118
00:08:54,780 --> 00:08:56,300
I've found out everything.

119
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,940
What do you already know?

120
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,820
Already know that

121
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:10,020
the relationship between you and Feng Xiaosheng is fake.

122
00:09:10,860 --> 00:09:12,060
You don't love him at all.

123
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,220
You are forced by his power,

124
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:18,700
have no other choice,

125
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:21,060
So, surrender and submit to it.

126
00:09:24,660 --> 00:09:25,580
That is it?

127
00:09:27,620 --> 00:09:28,540
If not?

128
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,660
Lian Lian,

129
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:35,420
I've told you many times,

130
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:37,500
stay away from the Feng Group,

131
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,140
jauhi Feng Xiaosheng,

132
00:09:39,140 --> 00:09:39,980
but you won't listen to me.

133
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:41,060
You insist on intervening,

134
00:09:41,060 --> 00:09:42,620
will not be deterred before it is too late.

135
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:46,340
Because like this,

136
00:09:47,380 --> 00:09:48,860
I will satisfy your curiosity.

137
00:09:49,020 --> 00:09:51,100
Today I will tell you everything.

138
00:09:52,820 --> 00:09:53,620
Correct.

139
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:56,380
Feng Xiaosheng and I are fake.

140
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:58,380
I don't love him at all.

141
00:09:59,500 --> 00:10:00,540
I really hate it.

142
00:10:01,180 --> 00:10:02,460
I really want to kill him.

143
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,260
Do you want to know why?

144
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,900
Because he is Shen Shijie.

145
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:15,380
Around March this year,

146
00:10:16,260 --> 00:10:18,180
the robber who almost killed me,

147
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,100
Shen Shijie.

148
00:10:23,140 --> 00:10:24,300
If that's true,

149
00:10:25,700 --> 00:10:27,820
Why did you keep holding it in until now and only then tell me?

150
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:30,420
Why?

151
00:10:35,580 --> 00:10:36,500
I don't believe it.

152
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,540
If that's true,

153
00:10:40,060 --> 00:10:41,820
why don't you ask the police for help?

154
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:46,620
What are you really thinking?

155
00:10:50,300 --> 00:10:51,180
You consider yourself

156
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:53,060
as a princess who was struck by disaster,

157
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:54,900
Want revenge yourself?

158
00:10:56,660 --> 00:10:57,820
Or you have a conspiracy theory

159
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,460
and suspect the police?

160
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,700
Or

161
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:05,180
you have Stockholm syndrome,

162
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:09,420
You fell in love with the robber who almost killed you?

163
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,420
Actually, what is the reason?

164
00:11:15,660 --> 00:11:16,620
Tell me.

165
00:11:17,940 --> 00:11:19,300
Actually because of what?

166
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,900
Because I can't afford even the slightest risk.

167
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:27,820
Never mind my parents,

168
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:29,020
or Yang Yuze.

169
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:31,580
It can't be because of me,

170
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:33,820
let them get hurt or face danger again

171
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:36,020
the slightest bit,

172
00:11:36,020 --> 00:11:37,780
even though the danger is just a threat.

173
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:43,060
I trust the police.

174
00:11:44,500 --> 00:11:45,620
I believed them in the end

175
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:48,180
can definitely try Shen Shijie according to the law.

176
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,820
However, they need time to investigate cases.

177
00:11:54,620 --> 00:11:56,180
There are still many limitations.

178
00:11:56,620 --> 00:11:59,580
This time is really too long for me.

179
00:12:02,060 --> 00:12:03,060
I'm scared,

180
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:05,700
So, I can't wait.

181
00:12:07,940 --> 00:12:09,660
Shen Shijie is a madman,

182
00:12:10,140 --> 00:12:11,540
as long as he is alive,

183
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:12,580
you don't know at all

184
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:15,660
what days and when he will do crazy things.

185
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:21,300
To my parents,

186
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,740
to Yang Yuze,

187
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,140
to my students,

188
00:12:24,140 --> 00:12:24,940
to yourself...

189
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:28,900
I have no other choice.

190
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:31,660
What I can do...

191
00:12:33,700 --> 00:12:35,660
just surrender myself,

192
00:12:38,460 --> 00:12:40,180
mengacaukan Shen Shijie,

193
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:41,620
trick him,

194
00:12:42,060 --> 00:12:43,060
paralyze him,

195
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,980
until finally I got conclusive proof.

196
00:12:47,580 --> 00:12:49,220
Totally made him...

197
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:53,740
and others are tried according to law.

198
00:13:01,940 --> 00:13:04,060
There really is too much going on here.

199
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,620
Maybe in a short time,

200
00:13:08,660 --> 00:13:10,420
I can't tell you clearly.

201
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:14,180
Maybe I'm too paranoid,

202
00:13:14,180 --> 00:13:15,180
It is my fault.

203
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,700
However, now I can only do

204
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,420
what do I think I should do.

205
00:13:26,300 --> 00:13:27,660
When the time is right,

206
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:29,460
I will of course ask the police for help,

207
00:13:29,460 --> 00:13:30,220
but now...

208
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:33,540
I just hope...

209
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:37,700
You can leave this troubled place.

210
00:14:44,540 --> 00:14:47,140
A fugitive who has been declared dead,

211
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:49,980
changed his face to become the chairman of the Feng Group.

212
00:14:52,020 --> 00:14:52,780
Journalist Lian,

213
00:14:53,420 --> 00:14:55,260
Do you believe stories like this?

214
00:15:01,020 --> 00:15:02,380
However, he already thought like this,

215
00:15:03,020 --> 00:15:04,700
always wanting to expose my cover,

216
00:15:04,700 --> 00:15:05,860
and sent me to prison.

217
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:07,620
Ridiculous, right?

218
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,620
What's even more ridiculous is

219
00:15:11,340 --> 00:15:12,740
I've even fallen in love with him,

220
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,020
and is very obsessed with him.

221
00:15:16,900 --> 00:15:20,140
So, you don't hesitate to use your own power

222
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,860
to make him leave Yang Yuze,

223
00:15:21,860 --> 00:15:23,020
and stay by your side.

224
00:15:24,460 --> 00:15:25,260
Actually,

225
00:15:27,540 --> 00:15:29,380
I look more like a lunatic than Ke Ying, right?

226
00:15:36,020 --> 00:15:36,980
It's about to start.

227
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,660
Come on, let's go down.

228
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:09,460
Audience,

229
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,460
Welcome to the charity appreciation dinner.

230
00:16:14,020 --> 00:16:17,420
Sapphire, also known as the stone of destiny.

231
00:16:17,700 --> 00:16:18,700
This symbolizes

232
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:20,020
loyalty,

233
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,260
purity,

234
00:16:21,700 --> 00:16:22,500
honesty,

235
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:23,500
and hope.

236
00:16:23,980 --> 00:16:24,820
Besides that,

237
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:27,500
also symbolizes love that will not fade.

238
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,020
This auction product

239
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:31,740
comes from a private collection in this city.

240
00:16:32,460 --> 00:16:33,260
It consists of

241
00:16:33,260 --> 00:16:36,060
12 pieces totaling 37.6 carats

242
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:36,980
Kashmir...

243
00:16:36,980 --> 00:16:37,900
What about the necklace?

244
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:39,180
Like it, no?

245
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,740
Combined with 498 pieces...

246
00:16:41,260 --> 00:16:42,260
I don't really understand.

247
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,740
The most important thing is

248
00:16:45,140 --> 00:16:46,340
I can't afford it either.

249
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:48,260
The best products in jewelry.

250
00:16:49,660 --> 00:16:50,940
The only request

251
00:16:51,180 --> 00:16:53,180
the owner of this necklace to us is

252
00:16:53,260 --> 00:16:56,740
to donate all proceeds from the auction

253
00:16:56,820 --> 00:16:58,780
to the Nanzhou City Children's Orphanage.

254
00:17:04,620 --> 00:17:06,140
Next, let's welcome,

255
00:17:06,660 --> 00:17:09,420
who bid this sapphire necklace for 10 million,

256
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,900
Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Feng Group,

257
00:17:11,020 --> 00:17:12,090
Tuan Feng Xiaosheng,

258
00:17:12,090 --> 00:17:13,090
to give a speech on stage.

259
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:22,940
Thank you to all of you.

260
00:17:24,620 --> 00:17:26,570
Donate this money to a children's orphanage,

261
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:28,540
I hope it can help the kids

262
00:17:28,540 --> 00:17:29,900
left by their parents.

263
00:17:30,660 --> 00:17:32,500
so that apart from food and clothing,

264
00:17:32,780 --> 00:17:33,980
they can be like us too,

265
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:35,740
can chase their dreams,

266
00:17:35,940 --> 00:17:37,220
and make their dreams come true.

267
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:38,420
Thank You.

268
00:17:42,500 --> 00:17:43,740
I want to take advantage of this opportunity,

269
00:17:44,740 --> 00:17:47,460
to give this necklace to a journalist who

270
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:48,980
Honest,

271
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:50,780
brave,

272
00:17:51,740 --> 00:17:55,140
and fight on the front lines without fear.

273
00:17:55,620 --> 00:17:57,820
Coincidentally he is also here today.

274
00:17:58,380 --> 00:18:00,380
She is Miss Lian Lian.

275
00:18:21,180 --> 00:18:22,500
I can't accept this necklace.

276
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:27,380
So many people are watching,

277
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,740
give me face.

278
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,380
Very beautiful.

279
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:21,860
(Feng Xiaosheng Bought a 10 million Necklace for His Fiancé's Best Friend)

280
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:22,620
(Sorry,)

281
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,100
(the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

282
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,100
It doesn't matter.

283
00:19:48,780 --> 00:19:49,580
medical history,

284
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:51,220
and a diagnosis certificate has been obtained.

285
00:19:59,480 --> 00:20:00,640
(Diagnosis Certificate)

286
00:20:04,760 --> 00:20:06,580
(Treatment History)

287
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:09,220
Nice work.

288
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:14,220
What...

289
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:15,940
will this work?

290
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:19,580
Anyway have to try it.

291
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:25,500
So...

292
00:20:25,860 --> 00:20:26,980
then I...

293
00:20:34,060 --> 00:20:35,220
You go with me.

294
00:20:38,300 --> 00:20:39,940
Thank you, Deputy Mayor Lian.

295
00:20:41,940 --> 00:20:42,980
Get back to work.

296
00:20:44,100 --> 00:20:44,820
Good.

297
00:21:04,780 --> 00:21:05,940
Isn't this pretty good?

298
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:09,180
Don't you always say that women are unreliable?

299
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:10,780
So, I replaced it.

300
00:21:11,180 --> 00:21:12,580
It should be according to your wishes.

301
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:14,380
Haphazard.

302
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,700
She is the daughter of Deputy Mayor Lian,

303
00:21:17,260 --> 00:21:18,820
a good woman from a dignified family.

304
00:21:19,980 --> 00:21:21,580
You don't have a problem why tease him?

305
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:22,860
The daughter of an official

306
00:21:22,860 --> 00:21:25,300
and the son of a rich family is a perfect match.

307
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,300
You worry too much.

308
00:21:28,300 --> 00:21:29,780
Blood pressure hasn't increased lately, right?

309
00:21:29,780 --> 00:21:30,780
Take care of your health.

310
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:33,100
I guess you should date in your old age,

311
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:34,540
don't watch me every day

312
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:36,100
I'm different from Ruichi,

313
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:37,180
I don't mind

314
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:38,580
You find a stepmother for me.

315
00:21:39,380 --> 00:21:40,020
You...

316
00:22:20,380 --> 00:22:21,100
Halo.

317
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:22,620
Have you read the newspaper?

318
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,540
Already.

319
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:26,060
How do you feel?

320
00:22:28,060 --> 00:22:29,020
Shen Shijie,

321
00:22:29,380 --> 00:22:30,580
is it interesting for you to do this?

322
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,780
Interesting.

323
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,820
Very interesting.

324
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:38,860
If you want revenge on me,

325
00:22:39,580 --> 00:22:40,500
just do it to me,

326
00:22:41,380 --> 00:22:42,540
why do you want to harm other people?

327
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,260
Wretched?

328
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:47,180
Why do you use words like this?

329
00:22:49,780 --> 00:22:51,780
Lian Lian is a very wonderful girl.

330
00:22:52,860 --> 00:22:54,100
His personality is more cheerful than yours,

331
00:22:54,260 --> 00:22:55,340
more open than you,

332
00:22:56,100 --> 00:22:57,820
everyone is better than you.

333
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:01,540
Why can't I sincerely pursue it?

334
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:06,540
If you really sincerely want to pursue it,

335
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,180
why are you calling me now?

336
00:23:10,380 --> 00:23:11,620
Because I'm happy.

337
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:16,460
I found a better girl than you.

338
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:18,980
I am happy,

339
00:23:20,500 --> 00:23:21,780
I want to share with you.

340
00:23:24,940 --> 00:23:25,700
Oh yes.

341
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:29,100
As a good friend of Lian Lian,

342
00:23:30,260 --> 00:23:33,380
can you tell me about his hobbies?

343
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:38,620
Halo.

344
00:23:41,220 --> 00:23:42,260
Why don't you speak?

345
00:23:44,060 --> 00:23:44,860
Besides that,

346
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:47,820
namaku Feng Xiaosheng...

347
00:23:49,540 --> 00:23:50,900
bukan Shen Shijie.

348
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:58,380
Ke Ying.

349
00:23:59,020 --> 00:23:59,860
Ke Ying!

350
00:24:06,860 --> 00:24:07,540
Sorry, Miss.

351
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:08,780
You still haven't paid.

352
00:24:09,540 --> 00:24:10,180
That...

353
00:24:10,180 --> 00:24:11,060
I'm sorry.

354
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:11,980
This way, please.

355
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,020
Officer Song, are you following me?

356
00:24:38,300 --> 00:24:39,380
Mrs. Ke, I...

357
00:24:41,140 --> 00:24:42,340
Thank you for your good intentions,

358
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:43,660
but I don't need it.

359
00:24:44,180 --> 00:24:45,420
You don't need to protect me like this.

360
00:25:06,100 --> 00:25:10,060
Jika Feng Xiaosheng sungguh adalah Shen Shijie,

361
00:25:10,300 --> 00:25:11,860
then all this is logical.

362
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,700
Try saying it.

363
00:25:13,980 --> 00:25:16,180
Shen Shijie is an escaped fugitive,

364
00:25:16,860 --> 00:25:19,260
survive death with help from someone.

365
00:25:20,340 --> 00:25:21,420
After plastic surgery,

366
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:22,420
kembali ke Nanzhou,

367
00:25:22,660 --> 00:25:23,740
suddenly changed

368
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:26,620
became the chairman of the Feng Group's board of directors, Feng Xiaosheng.

369
00:25:27,100 --> 00:25:28,100
For revenge,

370
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:29,580
torturing,

371
00:25:29,580 --> 00:25:31,420
threatening the victim from cases 3-14,

372
00:25:31,580 --> 00:25:33,700
namely Ke Ying, the first reporter.

373
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:36,340
After Ke Ying knew his identity,

374
00:25:36,420 --> 00:25:38,100
immediately seek help from Inspector Chen.

375
00:25:39,140 --> 00:25:40,380
At Ke Ying's request,

376
00:25:40,620 --> 00:25:42,580
Inspector Chen went to see Feng Xiaosheng.

377
00:25:43,460 --> 00:25:43,900
That day,

378
00:25:43,900 --> 00:25:45,300
I went with Inspector Chen,

379
00:25:45,380 --> 00:25:46,340
I'm waiting for him downstairs.

380
00:25:46,860 --> 00:25:47,820
On the way home,

381
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:49,380
Inspector Chen held my hand for a long time,

382
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:52,140
and asked me to play the video of Feng Xiaosheng's speech.

383
00:25:52,860 --> 00:25:53,820
Hold your hand?

384
00:25:53,900 --> 00:25:54,820
Why hold your hand?

385
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:57,460
Don't know, he didn't say.

386
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,540
Xing Wei, you keep talking.

387
00:26:01,700 --> 00:26:03,540
Inspector Chen went to see Feng Xiaosheng,

388
00:26:03,820 --> 00:26:05,180
deliberately brought up Shen Shijie.

389
00:26:05,740 --> 00:26:07,940
This made Feng Xiaosheng very scared.

390
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,900
So, he planned a car accident.

391
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:13,060
Dao Jian who acted,

392
00:26:13,900 --> 00:26:15,180
engineer a car accident,

393
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:16,940
and killed Inspector Chen.

394
00:26:19,180 --> 00:26:20,460
Dao Jian...

395
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:22,500
why did he listen to Feng Xiaosheng?

396
00:26:23,660 --> 00:26:24,660
Maybe...

397
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:27,020
he wanted to hug Feng Xiaosheng's legs,

398
00:26:27,380 --> 00:26:30,380
or there was a weakness in Feng Xiaosheng's hands.

399
00:26:33,220 --> 00:26:35,580
Waktu itu, Dao Jian yang mengkhianati Shen Shijie.

400
00:26:38,900 --> 00:26:41,140
Dao Jian dan Shen Shijie ini

401
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,700
working for second uncle,

402
00:26:43,420 --> 00:26:44,420
they both are friends,

403
00:26:44,540 --> 00:26:45,940
very understanding of each other.

404
00:26:47,100 --> 00:26:48,300
Shen Shijie ini,

405
00:26:48,700 --> 00:26:51,180
definitely knows many secrets of Dao Jian.

406
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,620
Not logical.

407
00:26:54,420 --> 00:26:55,220
Look at it.

408
00:26:56,220 --> 00:26:57,660
Dao Jian mengkhianati Shen Shijie,

409
00:26:58,260 --> 00:27:00,220
jika Feng Xiaosheng adalah Shen Shijie,

410
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,540
then why didn't he take revenge on Dao Jian?

411
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:02,940
Got revenge,

412
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,340
isn't it after utilizing the Dao Jian,

413
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:05,500
then kill Dao Jian?

414
00:27:06,860 --> 00:27:07,780
think about it,

415
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:09,500
Dao Jian hid so well,

416
00:27:09,660 --> 00:27:11,460
even the second uncle couldn't find it,

417
00:27:12,500 --> 00:27:13,980
but instead he was killed.

418
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,140
Who can kill him?

419
00:27:16,540 --> 00:27:17,540
Who will kill him?

420
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:19,660
Is it second uncle?

421
00:27:20,220 --> 00:27:21,100
Not second uncle.

422
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:22,860
Correct.

423
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:24,300
Not second uncle.

424
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:26,300
Even though it was the second uncle who killed him,

425
00:27:26,300 --> 00:27:26,900
that's not necessary either

426
00:27:26,900 --> 00:27:28,140
smashed his face and cut his hands.

427
00:27:31,580 --> 00:27:33,100
I've got the money,

428
00:27:33,340 --> 00:27:34,940
there is no revenge so great anymore.

429
00:27:35,780 --> 00:27:38,900
The one who really had a grudge with Dao Jian was Shen Shijie.

430
00:27:39,820 --> 00:27:40,980
The person who fell into the sea,

431
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,020
isn't his face also ruined?

432
00:27:45,580 --> 00:27:49,460
There were three reasons Feng Xiaosheng killed Dao Jian.

433
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,060
The first is revenge.

434
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:54,060
The second is to seize money.

435
00:27:54,700 --> 00:27:55,820
The third,

436
00:27:56,300 --> 00:27:57,500
kill to silence him.

437
00:28:01,660 --> 00:28:03,740
Dao Jian must have realized something

438
00:28:04,020 --> 00:28:05,420
while helping Feng Xiaosheng.

439
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:09,620
Maybe you already know this Feng Xiaosheng is fake.

440
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,220
Actually,

441
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:12,500
dia adalah Shen Shijie.

442
00:28:13,580 --> 00:28:14,380
Kapten Xiao,

443
00:28:14,900 --> 00:28:15,860
what do you think?

444
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,180
Your logical reasoning is very strong,

445
00:28:25,740 --> 00:28:27,380
but there is only one place where it is not suitable.

446
00:28:29,420 --> 00:28:30,060
Where?

447
00:28:32,020 --> 00:28:32,940
If

448
00:28:33,820 --> 00:28:35,220
Feng Xiaosheng yang sekarang

449
00:28:36,420 --> 00:28:37,460
adalah Shen Shijie,

450
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,940
Then, where was the real Feng Xiaosheng?

451
00:28:41,980 --> 00:28:42,740
Besides that,

452
00:28:43,020 --> 00:28:45,140
who was the dead Shen Shijie?

453
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:49,500
Feng Xiaosheng mati untuk Shen Shijie?

454
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,540
Impossible.

455
00:28:51,460 --> 00:28:53,460
When Shen Shijie jumped into the abyss,

456
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,380
Feng Xiaosheng was giving a speech at the convention center.

457
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,940
Let's hurry from there, right?

458
00:29:00,820 --> 00:29:03,500
Therefore, to investigate this case,

459
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:07,220
the most important part is finding

460
00:29:07,460 --> 00:29:09,660
It was Shen Shijie who fell off the cliff that time.

461
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,380
If that person was not Shen Shijie,

462
00:29:13,140 --> 00:29:14,340
then, who is that person?

463
00:29:17,900 --> 00:29:18,940
Isn't that time to find

464
00:29:18,940 --> 00:29:20,460
hair and fingerprint evidence

465
00:29:20,460 --> 00:29:21,620
in Shen Shijie's hiding place,

466
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:24,540
and matched the DNA on the corpse?

467
00:29:27,740 --> 00:29:29,500
Then, who exactly is this corpse?

468
00:29:31,220 --> 00:29:31,860
This...

469
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,420
more mysterious than a novel.

470
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,860
I think it's impossible.

471
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,580
I even feel...

472
00:29:39,580 --> 00:29:40,700
Ke Ying is possible

473
00:29:41,540 --> 00:29:42,620
has a little problem with his brain.

474
00:29:42,980 --> 00:29:44,460
Do you know there is a disease called

475
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:48,380
PTSD, post-traumatic stress disorder?

476
00:29:48,740 --> 00:29:50,100
If it's serious, it's the same as a mental disorder.

477
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:51,620
felt like everyone wanted to hurt him,

478
00:29:51,620 --> 00:29:54,460
perhaps there was a part of Feng Xiaosheng

479
00:29:54,460 --> 00:29:55,860
who is a bit similar to Shen Shijie,

480
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:57,380
so, he felt Feng Xiaosheng

481
00:29:57,380 --> 00:29:58,900
it was Shen Shijie who came back to take revenge on him.

482
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:02,220
Of course, Feng Xiaosheng was not a good person either,

483
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,940
Tapi dia pasti bukan Shen Shijie.

484
00:30:05,180 --> 00:30:06,460
Do you still remember...

485
00:30:06,900 --> 00:30:08,020
after the case occurred,

486
00:30:08,020 --> 00:30:09,380
Ke Ying was very scared

487
00:30:09,380 --> 00:30:10,660
Shen Shijie took revenge on him again.

488
00:30:10,660 --> 00:30:11,460
Every time you meet us

489
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,660
I'll ask if you've been arrested yet,

490
00:30:12,660 --> 00:30:13,500
have you been arrested yet?

491
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,500
How is Ke Ying?

492
00:30:17,260 --> 00:30:18,220
Scolding me.

493
00:30:18,540 --> 00:30:19,460
When we know we follow him,

494
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:20,380
he scolded me,

495
00:30:20,380 --> 00:30:21,460
said he didn't need our protection.

496
00:30:22,860 --> 00:30:23,700
If not,

497
00:30:23,900 --> 00:30:24,900
I'll just come back

498
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,380
there are so many things on the team.

499
00:30:55,420 --> 00:30:56,060
Sis Wu.

500
00:30:56,060 --> 00:30:57,180
What are you doing here?

501
00:30:57,260 --> 00:30:58,060
Look for me, okay?

502
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:00,660
Come on, come up for tea.

503
00:31:00,660 --> 00:31:01,220
Sis Wu, Sis Wu.

504
00:31:03,420 --> 00:31:04,220
Just forget it.

505
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,740
I didn't go up again so as not to embarrass you.

506
00:31:05,940 --> 00:31:06,460
Wait,

507
00:31:06,460 --> 00:31:07,620
what do you mean by this?

508
00:31:10,340 --> 00:31:11,180
Got a problem?

509
00:31:13,260 --> 00:31:13,940
What is it?

510
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:14,980
Say.

511
00:31:16,540 --> 00:31:17,620
Do you have more money?

512
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:18,580
Can you lend me some money?

513
00:31:18,740 --> 00:31:19,860
My mother was diagnosed with the disease,

514
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:21,220
now needs to be admitted for treatment.

515
00:31:22,020 --> 00:31:23,380
Sis Qiang is also not there,

516
00:31:23,980 --> 00:31:25,180
There is also no work at second uncle's place.

517
00:31:25,860 --> 00:31:26,700
So, I...

518
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,660
How much?

519
00:31:30,620 --> 00:31:31,620
I asked, how much do you want?

520
00:31:34,820 --> 00:31:35,100
If you...

521
00:31:35,100 --> 00:31:36,260
if you have more money,

522
00:31:36,260 --> 00:31:37,220
can you lend me five thousand?

523
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:38,740
If you can't, two thousand is fine too.

524
00:31:39,020 --> 00:31:40,380
If it's not enough, I'll borrow it from someone else.

525
00:31:40,500 --> 00:31:41,940
Five thousand, I've transferred it.

526
00:31:43,260 --> 00:31:44,020
Thank you, Sis Wu.

527
00:31:44,380 --> 00:31:45,300
Why are you so reluctant?

528
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,740
Family health is more important than anything else.

529
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:50,340
Correct.

530
00:31:51,460 --> 00:31:54,460
Lately, you're still like this?

531
00:31:56,460 --> 00:31:57,660
If not, what else can I do?

532
00:31:58,260 --> 00:32:00,580
You know, I can't do anything.

533
00:32:00,980 --> 00:32:01,860
Back when I followed Sis Qiang,

534
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:02,860
can still eat.

535
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:04,940
Now we are eradicating the mafia,

536
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:06,220
also don't know where Kak Qiang went.

537
00:32:06,740 --> 00:32:08,100
The second uncle has also stopped.

538
00:32:09,940 --> 00:32:11,700
Have hands and feet, still so energetic,

539
00:32:11,700 --> 00:32:12,660
can you still starve to death?

540
00:32:15,180 --> 00:32:15,940
Sis Wu,

541
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:18,100
What if,

542
00:32:18,660 --> 00:32:19,980
I'll just come with you?

543
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,340
Why follow me?

544
00:32:21,340 --> 00:32:23,220
Don't I go to work seriously every day?

545
00:32:27,220 --> 00:32:28,700
Do you know what my job used to be?

546
00:32:31,380 --> 00:32:32,260
Bu Ke.

547
00:32:33,420 --> 00:32:34,580
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

548
00:32:35,020 --> 00:32:36,580
Grandma Chen, why did you come?

549
00:32:36,580 --> 00:32:38,260
I came to visit you.

550
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,980
I should have gone to visit you.

551
00:32:41,380 --> 00:32:42,100
You are...

552
00:32:42,460 --> 00:32:43,540
It doesn't matter,

553
00:32:43,540 --> 00:32:46,020
it's just that my legs have no strength.

554
00:32:46,620 --> 00:32:49,020
The doctor said he could recover if treated.

555
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,300
Miao Miao,

556
00:32:50,500 --> 00:32:51,900
you go to class.

557
00:32:52,380 --> 00:32:53,980
I chatted with Mrs. Ke for a while.

558
00:32:54,500 --> 00:32:56,780
I'll call you when I'm gone, okay?

559
00:32:57,620 --> 00:32:58,740
Go quickly.

560
00:32:59,940 --> 00:33:01,140
I will take good care of grandma.

561
00:33:01,140 --> 00:33:01,860
Go quickly.

562
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:03,460
In that case,

563
00:33:03,460 --> 00:33:05,140
see you Bu Ke, see you Grandma.

564
00:33:09,580 --> 00:33:12,620
Actually, I always wanted to visit you,

565
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:15,020
but don't know how to face you.

566
00:33:15,420 --> 00:33:18,260
Your problem, Yu already told me.

567
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,700
Today I come,

568
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:22,740
first, would like to replace Miao Miao to thank you,

569
00:33:22,860 --> 00:33:25,060
then want to tell you

570
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,940
You're overthinking.

571
00:33:27,060 --> 00:33:29,060
I'm not that type of person

572
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:30,860
who cannot differentiate between right and wrong.

573
00:33:31,100 --> 00:33:31,780
However...

574
00:33:31,780 --> 00:33:32,900
Nothing however.

575
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:35,420
My son is a police officer.

576
00:33:36,060 --> 00:33:37,540
There you are, he has to catch criminals.

577
00:33:37,540 --> 00:33:39,540
There's no you, he also has to catch criminals.

578
00:33:39,860 --> 00:33:41,060
This is his job,

579
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:43,060
also his responsibility.

580
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:44,500
About...

581
00:33:44,780 --> 00:33:47,300
the people who killed my son for revenge,

582
00:33:48,260 --> 00:33:52,220
or for fear that my son will investigate them,

583
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:54,740
those who killed him are the perpetrators,

584
00:33:54,740 --> 00:33:56,180
not you, Mrs. Ke.

585
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:57,460
Who is guilty,

586
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,540
who is innocent,

587
00:33:59,380 --> 00:34:00,740
I know clearly.

588
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:03,980
Thank you, Grandma Chen.

589
00:34:31,100 --> 00:34:32,130
Yu Chengbo!

590
00:34:33,340 --> 00:34:34,100
Stop!

591
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:37,610
Pretend you don't know me?

592
00:34:38,900 --> 00:34:39,740
Familiar.

593
00:34:40,740 --> 00:34:41,900
Then, why are you ignoring me?

594
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:44,060
Because there is nothing to talk to you about.

595
00:34:46,380 --> 00:34:47,610
Are you the same as them?

596
00:34:48,260 --> 00:34:49,580
I feel like I'm deliberately making a fuss,

597
00:34:49,580 --> 00:34:50,780
and bother everyone?

598
00:34:51,210 --> 00:34:52,260
Isn't that so?

599
00:34:54,380 --> 00:34:56,610
It was to find the culprit, to avenge my father!

600
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,140
However, what was the result?

601
00:35:01,460 --> 00:35:02,300
I know.

602
00:35:03,260 --> 00:35:04,620
You are all on the side of Miss Lecturer Ke.

603
00:35:06,180 --> 00:35:07,820
Grandma thinks I'm very unreasonable,

604
00:35:07,900 --> 00:35:08,860
deliberately making a fuss.

605
00:35:09,340 --> 00:35:11,180
Uncle Xiao felt like I was bothering him.

606
00:35:11,460 --> 00:35:12,340
Even you...

607
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,620
Why me?

608
00:35:15,620 --> 00:35:16,860
You like Miss Lecturer Ke.

609
00:35:17,060 --> 00:35:19,420
So, you feel that whatever Mrs. Lecturer Ke is doing is right,

610
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,900
and whatever I did was wrong.

611
00:35:35,780 --> 00:35:37,220
I really like Miss Lecturer Ke,

612
00:35:38,180 --> 00:35:40,260
but not the kind of like you understand,

613
00:35:41,100 --> 00:35:42,140
but respect,

614
00:35:42,420 --> 00:35:43,220
amazed,

615
00:35:43,460 --> 00:35:44,300
darling,

616
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:45,180
it is respect.

617
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:49,100
However, he is not just a lecturer to me,

618
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:51,020
but a lamp for me,

619
00:35:51,500 --> 00:35:52,540
someone who guides me

620
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:56,180
When I feel insecure and sensitive because of poverty,

621
00:35:56,700 --> 00:35:58,540
he was the one who told me to be a person you have to have a big heart,

622
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:00,620
must face everything about oneself bravely.

623
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,780
When I was slandered and framed by others,

624
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,940
only he is willing to trust me unconditionally,

625
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:12,340
reached out to help me.

626
00:36:13,380 --> 00:36:14,380
Even this time,

627
00:36:15,180 --> 00:36:16,740
when you found out you were taken away by Feng Xiaosheng,

628
00:36:17,260 --> 00:36:18,300
also he...

629
00:36:19,420 --> 00:36:20,380
who ignores their own safety

630
00:36:20,380 --> 00:36:21,140
go save you.

631
00:36:21,580 --> 00:36:23,260
He shouldn't have gone,

632
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:25,180
can pretend not to know,

633
00:36:25,180 --> 00:36:26,860
can pretend to be helpless,

634
00:36:27,940 --> 00:36:29,940
no matter what the bad guy does to you.

635
00:36:36,140 --> 00:36:36,980
Miao Miao,

636
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:41,100
how can you treat others as fools?

637
00:36:42,260 --> 00:36:43,660
No.

638
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,300
I...

639
00:36:50,340 --> 00:36:51,860
I actually shouldn't scold you.

640
00:36:52,980 --> 00:36:54,980
Wasn't I the same as you before?

641
00:36:56,860 --> 00:36:58,580
I think I'm very smart.

642
00:37:01,620 --> 00:37:02,900
Until now I just realized,

643
00:37:04,380 --> 00:37:05,740
not how smart we are,

644
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:08,900
but we feel we are the most righteous.

645
00:37:13,660 --> 00:37:14,860
I am wrong.

646
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:17,620
I know wrong.

647
00:37:20,140 --> 00:37:22,100
I won't bother everyone anymore.

648
00:37:22,260 --> 00:37:23,460
I won't feel right anymore.

649
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,060
I won't act smart anymore.

650
00:37:36,500 --> 00:37:40,460
Senior Brother, I miss my father.

651
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:56,940
You feel...

652
00:37:58,100 --> 00:38:00,220
Feng Xiaosheng adalah Shen Shijie?

653
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:03,300
Indeed he is.

654
00:38:03,860 --> 00:38:04,940
He admitted it to me,

655
00:38:06,100 --> 00:38:07,300
but I have no proof,

656
00:38:08,260 --> 00:38:09,620
other people will think I'm crazy.

657
00:38:12,620 --> 00:38:13,420
So,

658
00:38:13,420 --> 00:38:14,580
do you have a plan?

659
00:38:17,820 --> 00:38:18,780
I also do not know.

660
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,820
Just feel so awake,

661
00:38:21,820 --> 00:38:23,180
suddenly hit by a big mountain,

662
00:38:24,460 --> 00:38:25,420
towering,

663
00:38:25,620 --> 00:38:26,700
and very big.

664
00:38:28,060 --> 00:38:29,060
Can't get through,

665
00:38:29,060 --> 00:38:30,060
and cannot be moved.

666
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:34,620
You can only hit yourself until your head bleeds, there is no other way.

667
00:38:35,780 --> 00:38:37,700
Every time there seems to be a little hope,

668
00:38:39,620 --> 00:38:40,940
I will be hit hard.

669
00:38:42,740 --> 00:38:45,180
How about taking a step back?

670
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:48,700
Behind is the abyss,

671
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,380
if you take a step back,

672
00:38:51,260 --> 00:38:52,460
will be shattered into pieces.

673
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:59,180
In that case, it can only go forward.

674
00:39:00,380 --> 00:39:02,100
Even if you hit your head and bleed,

675
00:39:02,940 --> 00:39:05,060
You also have to crash until there is a way out.

676
00:39:35,300 --> 00:39:36,380
Deputy Mayor Lian

677
00:39:36,820 --> 00:39:37,980
always very busy.

678
00:39:39,780 --> 00:39:40,940
Want to meet

679
00:39:42,460 --> 00:39:43,900
really not easy, yes.

680
00:39:47,180 --> 00:39:49,060
If there's a problem, just say it straight away.

681
00:39:49,820 --> 00:39:51,500
I won't beat around the bush any longer.

682
00:39:53,740 --> 00:39:56,940
This time I'm looking for you for the problem of our two children.

683
00:39:58,220 --> 00:40:00,500
I think you've seen the news too.

684
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,740
We are people who look up,

685
00:40:05,460 --> 00:40:07,180
always tolerated these two children

686
00:40:07,180 --> 00:40:08,180
create problems like this,

687
00:40:08,660 --> 00:40:09,780
not a good thing.

688
00:40:11,460 --> 00:40:13,460
Because they have this kind of intention,

689
00:40:14,300 --> 00:40:16,500
better establish this relationship.

690
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:18,100
Don't hope.

691
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:20,700
Why?

692
00:40:22,260 --> 00:40:25,460
You feel my family is not worthy of your daughter?

693
00:40:27,940 --> 00:40:28,700
Feng Yong,

694
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,460
who are you?

695
00:40:31,660 --> 00:40:33,260
What is the Feng family like?

696
00:40:33,260 --> 00:40:33,900
Others don't know,

697
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:34,980
don't I know?

698
00:40:35,660 --> 00:40:37,260
Don't mess with my daughter.

699
00:40:38,260 --> 00:40:39,140
I tell you.

700
00:40:39,900 --> 00:40:40,980
car factory problems,

701
00:40:41,140 --> 00:40:42,580
- I still haven't calculated it with you. - Car factory?

702
00:40:44,580 --> 00:40:45,660
What's wrong with the car factory?

703
00:40:45,900 --> 00:40:47,220
Don't you understand yourself?

704
00:40:48,700 --> 00:40:50,380
If it weren't for me to support you,

705
00:40:50,820 --> 00:40:51,460
police station

706
00:40:51,460 --> 00:40:52,980
I've been looking for you for a long time to understand the situation.

707
00:40:53,340 --> 00:40:55,140
Can you still sit quietly here?

708
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,780
Understand the situation?

709
00:41:02,820 --> 00:41:04,140
If so, we understand well.

710
00:41:07,060 --> 00:41:07,980
This place,

711
00:41:08,700 --> 00:41:09,940
who approved it?

712
00:41:11,180 --> 00:41:13,700
Who also signed this subsidy?

713
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,500
My tens of millions,

714
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:17,940
fed to which dog?

715
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:27,940
Lian Zhiyun, Lian Zhiyun.

716
00:41:29,940 --> 00:41:32,620
You think I'm the only one trapped and not free, huh?

717
00:41:32,940 --> 00:41:33,900
You're the same way.

718
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:38,980
The investigation team came here not only to investigate the Feng family,

719
00:41:39,580 --> 00:41:40,740
but also to reveal

720
00:41:41,260 --> 00:41:43,980
big corrupt like you.

721
00:41:48,940 --> 00:41:50,060
Both of us

722
00:41:51,780 --> 00:41:54,620
have been tied together for a long time.

723
00:41:54,740 --> 00:41:55,700
car factory,

724
00:41:56,580 --> 00:42:01,940
if this rock falls, it won't just hit my feet.

725
00:42:02,780 --> 00:42:03,460
Feng Yong...

726
00:42:04,780 --> 00:42:06,220
you old fox!

727
00:42:06,980 --> 00:42:08,100
Don't be angry.

728
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:10,220
Deputy Mayor Lian,

729
00:42:10,620 --> 00:42:11,740
Anger is not good for your health.

730
00:42:19,940 --> 00:42:22,300
Have you been checked for your illness?

731
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:26,380
Do I need to invite two experts for you?

732
00:42:27,100 --> 00:42:28,180
Checking you well.

733
00:42:29,940 --> 00:42:31,500
Don't get your diagnosis wrong again.

734
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:34,940
The leadership position requires you.

735
00:42:36,620 --> 00:42:37,580
Don't...

736
00:42:38,700 --> 00:42:39,900
go easy

737
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:42,580
Feng Yong,

738
00:42:43,140 --> 00:42:44,460
don't put too much pressure on people.

739
00:42:46,460 --> 00:42:47,700
I'm not pressuring you.

740
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:50,220
You want to let go,

741
00:42:50,980 --> 00:42:51,940
I understand.

742
00:42:53,660 --> 00:42:57,260
However, you must also give me space to retreat.

743
00:42:57,380 --> 00:42:58,940
What does this have to do with my daughter?

744
00:42:59,180 --> 00:42:59,940
Ada.

745
00:43:00,820 --> 00:43:02,140
There are many relationships.

746
00:43:03,460 --> 00:43:05,500
One, children's happiness.

747
00:43:05,860 --> 00:43:06,620
Second,

748
00:43:07,260 --> 00:43:08,460
can be considered giving

749
00:43:09,140 --> 00:43:11,180
additional guarantee for both our families.

750
00:43:12,740 --> 00:43:13,940
Win, yes, win together,

751
00:43:14,940 --> 00:43:16,460
