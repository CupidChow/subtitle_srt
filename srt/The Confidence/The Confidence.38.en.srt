2
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:32,860
=Episode 38=

3
00:01:59,340 --> 00:01:59,900
How Sheng?

4
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:04,420
Apparently you're right.

5
00:02:32,180 --> 00:02:32,780
Sis.

6
00:02:33,740 --> 00:02:34,860
Your appearance

7
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,140
and that's all...

8
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:37,940
are playing a spy, right?

9
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:40,940
My house has been searched and confiscated.

10
00:02:43,780 --> 00:02:44,900
Second uncle is there again?

11
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,820
Police.

12
00:02:49,820 --> 00:02:51,140
Po... polisi?

13
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:16,900
How do I treat you usually?

14
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:20,340
Cannot be expressed.

15
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:26,620
Sis.

16
00:03:28,580 --> 00:03:29,860
You just order it if there is a problem.

17
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:32,460
As heavy and as dangerous as any,

18
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,100
I, Wu...

19
00:03:33,100 --> 00:03:34,500
I want to make you rich.

20
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:38,700
Rich?

21
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:41,060
Second uncle wants to do smuggling again.

22
00:03:41,980 --> 00:03:43,500
Take the route you took at that time.

23
00:03:45,860 --> 00:03:46,580
This time,

24
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:49,660
we immediately seized it as ours.

25
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:52,900
Dare, no?

26
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,860
Gold again, huh?

27
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:02,900
More valuable than gold.

28
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:06,820
Sis.

29
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:09,020
Just the two of us?

30
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:10,180
Just the two of us.

31
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:17,100
Sis.

32
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,100
I've been through that route.

33
00:04:23,060 --> 00:04:24,380
There are dozens of them.

34
00:04:25,580 --> 00:04:26,420
Are your guts shrinking?

35
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,020
Sis.

36
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:46,380
Where is Miss Ke?

37
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,020
Sis,

38
00:05:06,380 --> 00:05:07,460
Can you also drive a ship?

39
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:09,060
A tight grip.

40
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:25,740
Here, eat some fruit.

41
00:05:25,780 --> 00:05:26,540
- Good. - Thank You.

42
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:27,660
- Do not hesitate. - Thank You.

43
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:28,220
Sit down.

44
00:05:50,620 --> 00:05:52,300
Auntie, eat an orange.

45
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,300
No need, you just eat.

46
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:58,740
Bibi.

47
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:01,020
Mother.

48
00:06:02,260 --> 00:06:03,420
Is dad better?

49
00:06:04,060 --> 00:06:05,980
He is much better after taking hypertension medication.

50
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,980
I told him to sleep a little longer.

51
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,180
That's good then.

52
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:25,380
Look, you...

53
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,740
I've been stubborn since I was little,

54
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:30,820
whatever problem you have, you always take it upon yourself.

55
00:06:33,660 --> 00:06:34,580
Who knows

56
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:35,860
during these three months you

57
00:06:36,820 --> 00:06:38,860
going through so many problems alone.

58
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:42,700
Why didn't you tell us?

59
00:06:45,460 --> 00:06:46,460
Me and your father...

60
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,340
now you know,

61
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,860
our feelings are really mixed.

62
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,220
Mother.

63
00:06:58,860 --> 00:06:59,660
Bibi,

64
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:01,860
he is also afraid that you and uncle are worried.

65
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:15,020
You're a stupid kid too.

66
00:07:19,380 --> 00:07:20,100
Let me open the door.

67
00:07:26,140 --> 00:07:26,740
Kapten Xiao.

68
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,500
No need, come on in.

69
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:32,700
There's no problem, right?

70
00:07:32,860 --> 00:07:33,460
No.

71
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:38,660
- Kapten Xiao. - Kapten Xiao.

72
00:07:43,340 --> 00:07:44,340
Have you been caught?

73
00:07:45,860 --> 00:07:46,700
Not yet.

74
00:07:48,700 --> 00:07:49,180
Ke Ying,

75
00:07:50,020 --> 00:07:50,820
there are several things

76
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:52,940
what I need to ask you.

77
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,100
Exactly as we thought.

78
00:08:18,300 --> 00:08:20,340
After comparing with Gang DNA,

79
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:24,340
we can already confirm that the corpse is Zhu Jianhai.

80
00:08:25,340 --> 00:08:26,300
Shen Shijie

81
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:28,020
it's not dead.

82
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,700
What I'm most worried about now...

83
00:08:36,260 --> 00:08:37,340
is to let him escape.

84
00:08:37,580 --> 00:08:38,090
Kapten Xiao,

85
00:08:38,660 --> 00:08:39,850
you have to catch him.

86
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:45,140
Now this problem is basically clear.

87
00:08:45,460 --> 00:08:47,220
Arresting suspects is our job.

88
00:08:48,340 --> 00:08:49,180
Bu Ke,

89
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:52,700
what I want to say is

90
00:08:53,860 --> 00:08:55,220
starting from now,

91
00:08:55,860 --> 00:08:57,340
you remember anything,

92
00:08:57,860 --> 00:08:58,860
whatever you know,

93
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:00,340
or...

94
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,700
someone related to this case contacted you,

95
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:07,620
You must immediately report it to us.

96
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:09,700
Can't act alone anymore.

97
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:12,060
Leave it to us to handle it.

98
00:09:20,860 --> 00:09:21,460
Good.

99
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,740
What about Wu?

100
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:34,420
This morning he contacted me briefly.

101
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,620
After that, there was no more news.

102
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:39,060
His friends also last saw him this morning.

103
00:09:39,580 --> 00:09:40,620
We've tried calling him,

104
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:42,140
found still active in the city.

105
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,020
However, it keeps changing places.

106
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,460
Keep moving places?

107
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,660
Normal circumstances should not be like this.

108
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:53,860
So, has he been found out?

109
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,980
Does not seem.

110
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:57,660
Maybe now,

111
00:09:57,660 --> 00:09:59,140
should still be by Shen Shijie's side.

112
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,500
Halo.

113
00:10:09,060 --> 00:10:09,660
Bureau Chief Liu.

114
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:12,860
Good.

115
00:10:13,140 --> 00:10:14,660
I understand, I will go back now.

116
00:10:16,580 --> 00:10:17,940
Has Shen Shijie been caught?

117
00:10:18,420 --> 00:10:19,460
This is another problem.

118
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:22,060
Bu Ke.

119
00:10:22,860 --> 00:10:24,820
Did you make a promise to us earlier?

120
00:10:27,100 --> 00:10:28,860
Can't act alone anymore.

121
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:30,660
Good.

122
00:10:49,460 --> 00:10:50,180
Sis,

123
00:10:51,060 --> 00:10:51,860
Let's eat.

124
00:10:52,060 --> 00:10:52,660
Here.

125
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,100
I don't want to eat, I don't have an appetite.

126
00:10:56,740 --> 00:10:57,300
Sis,

127
00:10:58,260 --> 00:10:59,540
when do we come back?

128
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:01,300
We also have to be prepared, right?

129
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:02,700
What's your hurry?

130
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,060
When the time comes, we will definitely return.

131
00:11:06,860 --> 00:11:07,740
You really don't want to eat?

132
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,220
Don't starve.

133
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:15,820
The preparations are complete,

134
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:16,980
Go straight away tomorrow morning.

135
00:11:17,860 --> 00:11:18,860
It was still Lu Er who gave the orders,

136
00:11:19,100 --> 00:11:20,060
You just calm down.

137
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:22,620
You also hid it from your wife?

138
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:24,860
I know how serious this problem is.

139
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:27,460
You take this.

140
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:30,580
Tomorrow as soon as I get into the car,

141
00:11:31,340 --> 00:11:32,740
throw away your old cell phone first,

142
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:33,980
and replace it with this.

143
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:38,340
To avoid police tracking.

144
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,340
Oh, ya, how.

145
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:46,300
If I go, what about you?

146
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:48,860
How about we just go together?

147
00:11:49,980 --> 00:11:51,740
Someone has to stay

148
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:53,860
to become police bait.

149
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,460
You go first.

150
00:11:58,340 --> 00:11:59,340
Once you're safe,

151
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:00,620
then think of me

152
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:06,860
Sis.

153
00:12:09,460 --> 00:12:10,340
It's time to go.

154
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:13,060
You still have to go home to get ready.

155
00:12:20,180 --> 00:12:20,700
Good.

156
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,580
Bureau Chief Liu.

157
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,180
Ketua Li.

158
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:39,300
Feng Meng started sending his things out,

159
00:12:39,860 --> 00:12:40,700
most likely want to run away.

160
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,380
Where is Feng Meng?

161
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,660
He just walked into Feng Yong's house,

162
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:46,820
not yet out.

163
00:12:47,660 --> 00:12:48,860
What about Feng Xiaosheng's whereabouts?

164
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:51,300
No problem.

165
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,500
However, this method is quite risky.

166
00:12:57,140 --> 00:12:57,980
Kapten Xiao

167
00:12:59,020 --> 00:13:00,980
always wanted to catch Feng Xiaosheng with his own hands.

168
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:04,500
Interpol

169
00:13:04,820 --> 00:13:07,220
hope we can help them in this chess game.

170
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:09,020
In order to eradicate it from the roots,

171
00:13:09,900 --> 00:13:10,700
superiors decide

172
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:12,020
we can work together with them.

173
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:18,540
Feng brothers

174
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:20,620
is already in our hands.

175
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,180
For the sake of the final result,

176
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:23,580
being arrested anywhere is the same.

177
00:13:29,060 --> 00:13:30,020
Well then, I'll arrange it.

178
00:13:30,740 --> 00:13:31,220
Good.

179
00:13:35,540 --> 00:13:36,780
Everyone's hungry, right?

180
00:13:38,740 --> 00:13:39,220
Go away.

181
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:40,860
Ask the canteen to cook Henan Soup Noodles.

182
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:41,740
Good.

183
00:13:42,460 --> 00:13:43,460
Add soy sauce-cooked meat, yes.

184
00:14:53,380 --> 00:14:54,620
(Fund Deposit Certificate)

185
00:15:38,660 --> 00:15:40,020
Bureau Chief Liu, Feng Meng had already come out.

186
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,340
You see.

187
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:50,500
Keep following him.

188
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,260
Good.

189
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:55,100
Notify the comrades who are watching around Feng Meng's house

190
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,300
to observe it.

191
00:15:56,540 --> 00:15:57,060
Good.

192
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:16,380
Why did it suddenly change like this?

193
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:19,940
Who can guess God's mood?

194
00:16:21,620 --> 00:16:22,660
Hurry up and pack.

195
00:16:23,340 --> 00:16:24,340
Bring more,

196
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,140
in the future...

197
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:27,860
it will be easier when you leave.

198
00:16:30,180 --> 00:16:31,140
You all go,

199
00:16:31,420 --> 00:16:33,340
what if the police arrest me?

200
00:16:34,260 --> 00:16:36,180
You're just an old woman, why arrest you?

201
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:38,340
Besides, you don't know anything either.

202
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:39,260
If they catch you,

203
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:40,420
they can't do anything either.

204
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:47,380
Meng.

205
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:50,060
How about you take me with you?

206
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:51,900
Don't be weird.

207
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,420
Brother hasn't left yet.

208
00:16:54,580 --> 00:16:55,220
I don't care!

209
00:16:56,380 --> 00:16:58,740
Who knows what cunning plans you have?

210
00:16:59,420 --> 00:17:00,860
Maybe you want to dump me,

211
00:17:01,140 --> 00:17:02,740
then go find the woman who seduced you.

212
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:05,570
The situation is like this, you are still making a fuss about this.

213
00:17:07,500 --> 00:17:08,290
After all,

214
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:09,540
although I don't care

215
00:17:09,540 --> 00:17:10,700
our husband and wife relationship has been going on for decades,

216
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:11,810
what about your son?

217
00:17:12,460 --> 00:17:14,980
Your son cannot possibly leave his biological mother

218
00:17:14,980 --> 00:17:15,900
and abandoned you, right?

219
00:17:17,660 --> 00:17:18,570
That's of course.

220
00:17:18,810 --> 00:17:20,700
My son, who is like you, has no conscience.

221
00:17:20,810 --> 00:17:21,700
I'm telling you,

222
00:17:21,940 --> 00:17:22,940
in the rest of my life,

223
00:17:23,050 --> 00:17:24,900
I only hope that my son will be filial to me.

224
00:17:27,090 --> 00:17:27,810
If you want to say,

225
00:17:27,810 --> 00:17:29,500
still my seeds are better.

226
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,380
Brother always looks down on Ruichi.

227
00:17:32,620 --> 00:17:33,260
In the end, still

228
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:34,620
should expect Ruichi to be devoted to him.

229
00:17:35,380 --> 00:17:37,140
Sheng is really smart and great,

230
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:38,180
but his life was short.

231
00:17:38,420 --> 00:17:39,020
The money he got,

232
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,260
doesn't it still belong to Ruichi in the end?

233
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,860
What you said is true, right?

234
00:17:44,340 --> 00:17:47,020
The current Sheng turned out to be fake?

235
00:17:47,580 --> 00:17:48,740
After he came back,

236
00:17:48,860 --> 00:17:50,620
I spoke to him several times.

237
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:51,980
I didn't realize it at all.

238
00:17:52,300 --> 00:17:53,500
I just didn't realize it,

239
00:17:53,500 --> 00:17:54,540
how could you possibly realize that?

240
00:17:56,540 --> 00:17:58,300
If I say so, this child is really very cruel.

241
00:17:58,980 --> 00:18:00,180
If it weren't for him to make trouble,

242
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,580
Ruichi could earn another few billion.

243
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,860
Base.

244
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,180
Already, already, hurry up and pack.

245
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,300
It's almost dawn.

246
00:18:10,020 --> 00:18:12,420
Don't push me anymore, my brain is already messed up.

247
00:18:12,420 --> 00:18:13,740
I'm not pressing you, I'm not pressing you.

248
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:14,860
Your hands move faster.

249
00:18:41,620 --> 00:18:42,180
Wake up.

250
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,020
Let's go.

251
00:18:43,300 --> 00:18:44,020
Ya, Kak.

252
00:18:50,740 --> 00:18:51,460
Whose car?

253
00:18:52,580 --> 00:18:53,620
The one named Hua Zi.

254
00:18:57,100 --> 00:18:58,020
This Hua Zi,

255
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,700
used to follow Feng Xiaosheng.

256
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:01,580
Just calm down.

257
00:19:02,100 --> 00:19:03,940
Captain Xiao has already sent people to follow him there.

258
00:19:22,780 --> 00:19:24,380
(Utilities)

259
00:19:24,380 --> 00:19:24,780
(Recorder)

260
00:21:22,540 --> 00:21:23,060
Ayo.

261
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:30,340
(Public toilet)

262
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:34,340
What are you doing?

263
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,420
Does your family own a toilet?

264
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:37,140
Stop!

265
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,940
(Kompleks Binshui Wuli)

266
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:12,940
Your appearance is not bad, yes.

267
00:22:16,820 --> 00:22:17,820
You're very tired, right?

268
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:20,900
Where are you going?

269
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:24,820
Gerbang Tol Hongshikou?

270
00:22:28,940 --> 00:22:29,540
Why?

271
00:22:30,220 --> 00:22:31,100
I am wrong?

272
00:22:32,380 --> 00:22:34,220
Didn't second uncle go that way?

273
00:22:35,180 --> 00:22:38,460
Using his own younger sibling as bait for the police and investigative team,

274
00:22:38,460 --> 00:22:40,300
this kind of thing only you have the heart to do!

275
00:22:40,700 --> 00:22:41,140
You...

276
00:22:42,460 --> 00:22:43,420
What are you?

277
00:22:47,140 --> 00:22:47,940
Shen Shijie,

278
00:22:49,460 --> 00:22:50,540
as long as I can get out,

279
00:22:52,180 --> 00:22:53,060
500 million in American docks

280
00:22:54,020 --> 00:22:54,820
I'll give it to you straight away.

281
00:22:54,940 --> 00:22:55,900
Useless!

282
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:58,940
Give me the goods.

283
00:23:01,020 --> 00:23:01,820
What item?

284
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:05,180
You're old, so your memory is bad, right?

285
00:23:07,700 --> 00:23:09,220
I will help you remember it.

286
00:23:12,220 --> 00:23:13,380
Have you remembered, haven't you?

287
00:23:14,180 --> 00:23:15,140
Give me the goods!

288
00:23:31,060 --> 00:23:33,580
With this, I can earn as much money as I want.

289
00:23:35,660 --> 00:23:36,460
Without me...

290
00:23:36,940 --> 00:23:37,780
even if you have the goods,

291
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,380
you can't get the money either.

292
00:23:40,460 --> 00:23:41,380
Don't forget,

293
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,220
I...

294
00:23:44,460 --> 00:23:46,340
is Feng Xiaosheng.

295
00:23:49,020 --> 00:23:49,780
Give me your phone!

296
00:23:50,780 --> 00:23:51,460
Fast!

297
00:24:06,780 --> 00:24:07,260
Halo.

298
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,580
Is this a police station?

299
00:24:09,220 --> 00:24:10,100
Di Jalan Shigu,

300
00:24:10,340 --> 00:24:11,540
in a black Mazda tricolor,

301
00:24:11,780 --> 00:24:12,780
someone is hurt.

302
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,340
You... what do you want to do?

303
00:24:17,220 --> 00:24:21,820
Killing you is not as interesting as throwing you in prison for life.

304
00:24:24,540 --> 00:24:25,060
You...

305
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,580
Old fart.

306
00:24:51,540 --> 00:24:52,140
Road.

307
00:25:20,860 --> 00:25:22,540
(Jin)

308
00:25:22,980 --> 00:25:25,500
(Get ready to go.)

309
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:35,100
Queban.

310
00:25:36,500 --> 00:25:37,260
Let's go.

311
00:25:39,940 --> 00:25:40,860
You two take one car.

312
00:25:40,940 --> 00:25:41,780
I took this car.

313
00:25:42,940 --> 00:25:43,460
Kak Jin

314
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:45,340
Why don't you play like normal this time?

315
00:25:46,020 --> 00:25:47,820
If you understand how to play, you are already the boss.

316
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:48,860
Work in silence, don't be fussy.

317
00:25:48,860 --> 00:25:49,340
Take this.

318
00:25:49,940 --> 00:25:50,500
Leave.

319
00:25:53,660 --> 00:25:55,100
Be a little nimble, okay?

320
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:21,860
Bureau Chief Liu, it should be fine.

321
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:25,660
Okay,

322
00:26:26,180 --> 00:26:27,180
has everyone arrived?

323
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,380
Already.

324
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,140
Every team pays attention.

325
00:26:30,780 --> 00:26:32,620
Catch them at Hongshikou Toll Gate.

326
00:26:32,740 --> 00:26:33,700
Good!

327
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:35,540
Attention Team One,

328
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:37,060
catch them at Hongshikou Toll Gate.

329
00:26:38,260 --> 00:26:39,100
Attention Team Two,

330
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:40,220
catch them at Hongshikou Toll Gate.

331
00:26:40,220 --> 00:26:40,860
Bureau Chief Liu!

332
00:26:42,980 --> 00:26:43,700
Feng Xiaosheng had already appeared.

333
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,900
Fine, I understand.

334
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:51,540
Feng Xiaosheng suddenly appeared.

335
00:26:52,140 --> 00:26:53,540
After injuring Feng Yong, he ran away.

336
00:26:55,420 --> 00:26:58,580
He should have gone after the Feng brothers' overseas assets.

337
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,420
As we expected.

338
00:27:12,580 --> 00:27:14,140
(Qiu Diving Club)

339
00:27:14,140 --> 00:27:14,660
Sis.

340
00:27:15,060 --> 00:27:16,300
We don't go to rob second uncle?

341
00:27:16,820 --> 00:27:18,140
The second uncle was left to the police alone.

342
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:19,300
How about us?

343
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,740
We will go far.

344
00:27:24,820 --> 00:27:25,660
I'm fine, Yuze.

345
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:26,820
You just focus on work.

346
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:28,140
Don't worry about me.

347
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,580
You take care of yourself.

348
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,500
OK, see you.

349
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:42,780
(Incoming Call; Big Cat Lian)

350
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,700
Halo, Lian Lian.

351
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,260
OKA, who is.

352
00:27:49,460 --> 00:27:50,140
Who are you?

353
00:27:51,020 --> 00:27:52,140
It doesn't matter who I am.

354

What's important is your friend, Lian Lian,

355
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,100
it's in my hands.

356
00:27:56,380 --> 00:27:57,380
From now on,

357
00:27:58,300 --> 00:27:59,620
you remember anything,

358
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,100
whatever you know,

359
00:28:01,820 --> 00:28:02,620
or...

360
00:28:04,940 --> 00:28:07,020
someone related to this case contacted you,

361
00:28:07,380 --> 00:28:09,900
You must immediately report it to us.

362
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,980
Can't act alone anymore.

363
00:28:12,900 --> 00:28:14,260
Leave it to us to handle it.

364
00:28:16,300 --> 00:28:17,260
What do you want?

365
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:19,420
What is it?

366
00:28:26,500 --> 00:28:28,220
How can I know what you say is true or not?

367
00:28:28,580 --> 00:28:29,540
Have Lian Lian answer the phone.

(Kidnapping)

369
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,980
I have to hear Lian Lian's voice.

370
00:28:41,780 --> 00:28:43,660
Let go of the leash! let me go!

371
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:46,140
This time you believe it, right?

372
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,260
You calm down first.

373
00:28:49,980 --> 00:28:51,140
If there is a problem, we talk about it carefully.

374
00:28:51,260 --> 00:28:52,500
Don't waste any more time either.

375
00:28:52,500 --> 00:28:54,380
I know there are police on guard at your house.

376
00:28:54,660 --> 00:28:56,020
What I want to do is very simple.

377
00:28:56,020 --> 00:28:58,380
You come out and come with me, then I will let your friends go.

378
00:28:58,380 --> 00:28:59,140
Or...

379
00:28:59,460 --> 00:29:00,260
Or what?

380
00:29:01,220 --> 00:29:02,580
I won't mince words.

381
00:29:02,580 --> 00:29:03,420
If you don't come out,

382
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:05,300
I was forced to accompany your friend to death.

383
00:29:05,380 --> 00:29:06,180
Don't!

384
00:29:06,940 --> 00:29:08,140
Well then, stop the nonsense.

385
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:08,860
Within five minutes,

386
00:29:08,860 --> 00:29:10,140
you go out with your own car.

387
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:11,580
I'll tell you where to drive.

388
00:29:11,940 --> 00:29:12,420
Remember,

389
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,660
get rid of the police who are stalking you.

390
00:29:14,660 --> 00:29:17,500
Or, your friend will explode on the spot.

391
00:29:18,380 --> 00:29:19,580
Is Feng Xiaosheng beside you?

392
00:29:19,580 --> 00:29:20,460
Have him answer the phone.

393
00:29:20,580 --> 00:29:21,540
I want to talk to him.

394
00:29:25,380 --> 00:29:26,180
What happened?

395
00:29:26,340 --> 00:29:27,140
Feng Xiaosheng?

396
00:29:28,740 --> 00:29:29,500
Not him.

397
00:29:30,460 --> 00:29:31,100
Ying Ying,

398
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:32,540
what happened?

399
00:29:33,540 --> 00:29:34,460
Speak.

400
00:29:36,620 --> 00:29:37,220
Ying Ying!

401
00:29:38,940 --> 00:29:39,620
Ying Ying.

402
00:29:40,700 --> 00:29:41,620
You can't go.

403
00:29:42,300 --> 00:29:43,420
He hates you so much,

404
00:29:43,540 --> 00:29:44,820
he won't let you go.

405
00:29:45,260 --> 00:29:45,780
Mother,

406
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:47,460
I have to go.

407
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,180
If I go,

408
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,340
Lian Lian still had a way out.

409
00:29:50,340 --> 00:29:51,180
If I don't go,

410
00:29:51,660 --> 00:29:53,060
then he will surely die.

411
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,020
Really, Mom.

412
00:29:54,180 --> 00:29:55,460
I was the one who dragged him into this problem.

413
00:29:56,060 --> 00:29:58,460
No, I can't let you go.

414
00:29:58,740 --> 00:30:00,540
Just leave this matter to the police.

415
00:30:00,780 --> 00:30:01,300
Mother!

416
00:30:01,540 --> 00:30:02,900
Just let him go.

417
00:30:12,820 --> 00:30:14,100
Just let him go.

418
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:15,820
If he doesn't go,

419
00:30:16,940 --> 00:30:18,820
he would blame himself for the rest of his life.

420
00:30:19,060 --> 00:30:19,900
!

421
00:30:20,060 --> 00:30:21,260
Just let him go!

422
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:22,900
Go away.

423
00:30:23,060 --> 00:30:23,940
- Ying Ying! - Bu Ke!

424
00:30:23,940 --> 00:30:24,820
You come back.

425
00:30:26,180 --> 00:30:27,260
Mrs. Ke, wait a minute!

426
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:27,940
Fine, I understand.

427
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:28,940
Bu Ke.

428
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:30,740
I just called the office,

429
00:30:30,740 --> 00:30:32,460
he said the kidnapper was not Feng Xiaosheng.

430
00:30:32,620 --> 00:30:34,140
He might have already left Nanzhou.

431
00:30:34,820 --> 00:30:36,660
So, please keep calm and cooperate with us.

432
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:38,140
Leave it to us to handle it.

433
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:40,940
Lian Lian still has to be saved, right?

434
00:30:41,820 --> 00:30:42,340
Just calm down,

435
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,300
I will definitely cooperate with you.

436
00:30:43,420 --> 00:30:44,820
However, earlier on the phone it was said,

437
00:30:45,020 --> 00:30:46,460
If I don't come out in five minutes,

438
00:30:46,820 --> 00:30:47,980
then Lian Lian will be in danger.

439
00:30:48,620 --> 00:30:49,540
Let's go now,

440
00:30:50,140 --> 00:30:51,060
still make sure to connect with them.

441
00:30:51,060 --> 00:30:52,300
Your car is coming behind me, right?

442
00:30:53,820 --> 00:30:54,380
Good.

443
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,980
You have to drive slowly.

444
00:31:00,260 --> 00:31:01,060
I'm out.

445
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,220
Where is Lian Lian?

446
00:31:03,020 --> 00:31:05,620
Pass from Changmin Street to the end of the street.

447
00:31:06,620 --> 00:31:07,020
Good.

448
00:31:18,180 --> 00:31:19,980
Why was Ke Ying driving that fast?

449
00:31:21,980 --> 00:31:22,500
No problem.

450
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:23,660
I'll follow closely.

451
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:33,340
Turn around after arriving at Hengtong Road.

452
00:31:45,540 --> 00:31:46,340
Where are you?

453
00:31:48,580 --> 00:31:50,180
There are police following you, right?

454
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:53,540
There isn't one in my car.

455
00:31:54,140 --> 00:31:55,660
Behind me was someone following me or not, I don't know.

456
00:31:58,140 --> 00:31:58,740
Okay.

457
00:31:59,380 --> 00:32:00,620
You come to the port first.

458
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,300
We've been monitoring Ke Ying's phone.

459
00:32:04,420 --> 00:32:04,980
Good.

460
00:32:07,780 --> 00:32:08,660
Now where to go?

461
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:10,100
OK, accepted.

462
00:32:10,940 --> 00:32:11,420
Zhang Peng.

463
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:12,300
Quick, turn it around.

464
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:13,860
Go towards Yihaishan Port.

465
00:32:14,180 --> 00:32:14,740
Understand.

466
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:40,420
Lian Lian!

467
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,740
You let him go!

468
00:32:48,500 --> 00:32:49,300
Release him?

469
00:32:49,740 --> 00:32:50,460
You can.

470
00:32:51,140 --> 00:32:51,980
You come up here,

471
00:32:52,660 --> 00:32:53,460
then I will release it.

472
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,020
You let him go first.

473
00:32:57,940 --> 00:32:58,500
Good.

474
00:33:03,780 --> 00:33:04,500
Look at this.

475
00:33:06,940 --> 00:33:07,900
What is bound here?

476
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:10,140
How?

477
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,300
You came up here in his place, no problem, right?

478
00:33:35,380 --> 00:33:36,020
Here.

479
00:33:36,540 --> 00:33:37,180
A lot!

480
00:33:39,780 --> 00:33:40,420
Here.

481
00:33:46,300 --> 00:33:47,020
Ke Ying!

482
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:48,380
Lian Lian,

483
00:33:48,540 --> 00:33:49,300
go quickly

484
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,660
I'm fine, you go quickly.

485
00:33:50,660 --> 00:33:51,700
Can't, can't.

486
00:33:51,900 --> 00:33:53,060
You can't go with him.

487
00:33:53,420 --> 00:33:54,660
I have to go catch him.

488
00:33:54,900 --> 00:33:56,700
You can't do it alone.

489
00:33:56,980 --> 00:33:58,180
- Catch Shen Shijie back... - Quick!

490
00:33:59,260 --> 00:34:00,820
I have to catch him.

491
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,340
Hurry up!

492
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:05,180
Can't.

493
00:34:13,100 --> 00:34:14,940
I see Jie has fallen for your trick.

494
00:34:15,340 --> 00:34:17,460
If it were me, there would be no need to bother with this at all.

495
00:34:17,780 --> 00:34:18,500
Ke Ying.

496
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:22,380
Ke Ying!

497
00:34:24,210 --> 00:34:25,340
Ke Ying!

498
00:34:28,020 --> 00:34:29,130
Ke Ying!

499
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:45,940
Ke Ying!

500
00:34:47,130 --> 00:34:48,100
Ke Ying!

501
00:34:54,900 --> 00:34:56,260
Ke Ying.

502
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,100
Ke Ying.

503
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,740
Xing Wei.

504
00:35:13,860 --> 00:35:14,780
Ayo.

505
00:35:16,660 --> 00:35:17,660
Lian Lian!

506
00:35:17,740 --> 00:35:18,300
Journalist Lian.

507
00:35:18,500 --> 00:35:19,020
Lian Lian!

508
00:35:19,020 --> 00:35:19,820
Do not come close!

509
00:35:27,260 --> 00:35:27,860
Lian...

510
00:35:36,900 --> 00:35:37,660
Do not come close.

511
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,780
Feng Group's lawyer, Yang Yucheng,

512
00:35:46,060 --> 00:35:48,180
it had already been found in a secret room in Feng Yong's residence.

513
00:35:49,700 --> 00:35:51,780
After being rescued, he had passed the critical period.

514
00:35:51,980 --> 00:35:54,060
Currently providing information.

515
00:35:55,380 --> 00:35:57,300
Feng Group Financial Supervisor, Yuan Fenfang,

516
00:35:58,020 --> 00:35:59,380
after being missing for days,

517
00:35:59,980 --> 00:36:02,660
yesterday he surrendered himself to our people's security agencies.

518
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,260
According to his confession,

519
00:36:05,500 --> 00:36:09,180
funds that Feng Company diverted to Europe and other countries illegally

520
00:36:09,300 --> 00:36:10,620
reaching billions of yuan.

521
00:36:12,740 --> 00:36:15,060
There are more than 20 projects involved in this case.

522
00:36:16,260 --> 00:36:18,580
Many higher-ups of the Feng Group were involved in this case.

523
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,180
Former municipal office director, Pei Zhongyuan,

524
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:25,020
allegedly acting as a protector for a mafia organization.

525
00:36:25,020 --> 00:36:27,180
Currently, he is undergoing a disciplinary violation investigation

526
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,420
and surveillance investigations.

527
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:31,380
The Feng Group corrupted state-owned assets,

528
00:36:31,620 --> 00:36:33,740
diverting assets in an illegal manner,

529
00:36:33,980 --> 00:36:35,900
money laundering, bribery and other crimes.

530
00:36:36,780 --> 00:36:38,180
Their crimes have been proven.

531
00:36:40,220 --> 00:36:42,740
A mafia group led by Feng Yong and Feng Meng

532
00:36:43,540 --> 00:36:45,060
we've all caught them.

533
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:49,020
Now they have both been arrested by the people's security agency.

534
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:51,820
Down!

535
00:36:54,340 --> 00:36:54,940
Don't move!

536
00:36:57,780 --> 00:36:59,180
Now, based on reports,

537
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,460
Feng Xiaosheng dan Feng Ruichi

538
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,900
Currently continuing to hide

539
00:37:04,260 --> 00:37:05,500
within the territory of power

540
00:37:05,500 --> 00:37:06,580
big drug lord, Dan Yue.

541
00:37:08,020 --> 00:37:11,060
The suspect Shen Kun has also fled abroad.

542
00:37:12,860 --> 00:37:13,380
Of course,

543
00:37:14,380 --> 00:37:16,340
a large amount of funds from the Feng Group

544
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:19,380
was still in Feng Ruichi's grasp.

545
00:37:20,300 --> 00:37:21,540
A few days ago,

546
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:23,020
foreign police

547
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:26,020
contact us via Interpol.

548
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,260
Katanya Shen Shijie

549
00:37:28,540 --> 00:37:30,740
and Dan Yue's mysterious henchman

550
00:37:30,940 --> 00:37:32,100
make contact.

551
00:37:33,300 --> 00:37:35,580
They hope we can provide help,

552
00:37:36,980 --> 00:37:41,260
arrested Shen Shijie and Feng Ruichi overseas.

553
00:37:42,700 --> 00:37:44,980
At the same time,

554
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:46,700
recover huge state losses.

555
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,980
Next, we discuss

556
00:37:48,980 --> 00:37:50,700
investigative placement abroad.

557
00:38:01,620 --> 00:38:02,460
Yes I know.

558
00:38:03,100 --> 00:38:04,620
I know the photo isn't very clear.

559
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:09,940
OK, I'll try looking again later and send you a photo of the front view.

560
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,100
Wait a minute.

561
00:38:26,380 --> 00:38:27,420
Okay, thank you.

562
00:38:27,420 --> 00:38:28,260
See you later.

563
00:38:30,980 --> 00:38:32,020
You want to go, right?

564
00:38:36,300 --> 00:38:37,420
I will go to Luoyang, there is an operation.

565
00:38:39,500 --> 00:38:41,060
Senior asked me to go for a combined diagnosis.

566
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,060
My arrival doesn't bother you, right?

567
00:38:46,860 --> 00:38:48,300
What are you talking about? Sit down.

568
00:38:51,980 --> 00:38:53,020
I'll brew you a cup of coffee.

569
00:39:51,740 --> 00:39:52,860
Good Boy, drink a little more.

570
00:39:52,860 --> 00:39:53,940
Mother worked hard to prepare it.

571
00:39:53,940 --> 00:39:55,300
He looks quite similar to you.

572
00:39:57,180 --> 00:39:58,340
What do you mean by this look?

573
00:39:58,580 --> 00:39:59,820
Still more like my wife.

574
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:01,180
There, go play.

575
00:40:01,540 --> 00:40:03,220
It's good if you are self-aware.

576
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,060
Have you found my person yet?

577
00:40:13,020 --> 00:40:13,740
Xiao,

578
00:40:14,060 --> 00:40:16,260
even though we, the Narcotics Unit, owe you a debt of gratitude,

579
00:40:16,860 --> 00:40:18,580
but we found an informant there

580
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:20,740
It's not easy either, you know?

581
00:40:21,500 --> 00:40:22,500
What do you mean, you've met?

582
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:23,580
Very good!

583
00:40:26,860 --> 00:40:27,460
However,

584
00:40:28,020 --> 00:40:29,540
that person of yours, what is his nature like?

585
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:31,260
Are you sure you can rely on it?

586
00:40:38,100 --> 00:40:39,980
Dad, come play with me, okay?

587
00:40:40,220 --> 00:40:41,380
Ya. Nanti, ya.

588
00:40:41,380 --> 00:40:42,580
Dad still has things to do. Later, yeah.

589
00:40:42,620 --> 00:40:43,260
- Yes? - Good.

590
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:44,260
You play first.

591
00:40:45,500 --> 00:40:46,300
Be careful, yes.

592
00:40:55,140 --> 00:40:59,380
(Somewhere in Southeast Asia)

593
00:41:04,300 --> 00:41:06,060
Move quickly.

594
00:41:16,740 --> 00:41:18,340
Fast!

595
00:41:18,380 --> 00:41:19,060
Be careful, yes.

596
00:41:20,500 --> 00:41:21,340
Fast.

597
00:41:24,060 --> 00:41:25,060
Fast.

598
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:41,500
Fast.

599
00:41:47,940 --> 00:41:48,620
Be a little nimble.

600
00:41:49,060 --> 00:41:49,540
Good.

601
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:31,980
What are you doing?

602
00:42:32,780 --> 00:42:33,900
Delivering fruit.

603
00:42:35,220 --> 00:42:35,980
Come in.

604
00:42:51,100 --> 00:42:52,020
