00:01:30,340 --> 00:01:32,900
=Episode 13=

3
00:02:24,100 --> 00:02:24,860
Miss Ke.

4
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:27,340
Your father is all right, right?

5
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:32,340
That's fine, thank you.

6
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:36,060
That's good then.

7
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:37,380
In human life...

8
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:40,860
nothing is more important than

9
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:42,620
a family can gather together,

10
00:02:43,060 --> 00:02:44,900
live healthy and happy.

11
00:02:45,620 --> 00:02:46,180
Really.

12
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:51,260
What you said is right.

13
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:55,180
Don't blame me for being fussy.

14
00:02:55,900 --> 00:02:57,020
I think you

15
00:02:57,500 --> 00:02:58,700
too stubborn.

16
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:01,260
Your profession,

17
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:02,620
where can argue with guests?

18
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:06,860
You must learn to be gentler, to fight violence with gentleness.

19
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:08,380
Sis Wu.

20
00:03:08,660 --> 00:03:10,900
Don't, don't, don't. Just call Wu.

21
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:14,500
Previously you took me to the hospital.

22
00:03:15,380 --> 00:03:16,580
You're the one covering all the medical expenses,

23
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:17,380
I haven't returned it to you yet.

24
00:03:18,300 --> 00:03:19,220
It's okay, it's okay.

25
00:03:19,580 --> 00:03:21,180
Master Feng already gave it to me.

26
00:03:28,380 --> 00:03:29,860
Didn't you go with Dao Jian before?

27
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:32,140
Why now go with Mr. Feng?

28
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:39,220
We who are these men,

29
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:41,900
about who to go with,

30
00:03:42,500 --> 00:03:44,140
doesn't it depend on orders from the boss?

31
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:49,860
You didn't know Mr. Feng before?

32
00:03:51,580 --> 00:03:53,620
Previously, I was just a food delivery person.

33
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,260
How can you know someone like him?

34
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,220
He also didn't order outside food.

35
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:13,060
Why did Dao Jian kill the police?

36
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:16,180
I don't know about that.

37
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:17,500
I heard,

38
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:19,860
it has something to do with the old Brother Jie.

39
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,900
Shen Shijie?

40
00:04:25,860 --> 00:04:26,500
Correct.

41
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,900
He used to be second uncle's greatest subordinate.

42
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:31,260
After that, he committed a crime.

43
00:04:31,420 --> 00:04:33,340
Dao Jian revealed it to the police.

44
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,900
At first he ran away,

45
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:36,420
I don't know why he came back.

46
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,940
Finally the police...

47
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:39,860
kill him.

48
00:04:40,340 --> 00:04:42,420
Dao Jian, this kid is really very rotten.

49
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:44,700
In front of him, laughing and acting like a brother,

50
00:04:45,420 --> 00:04:46,220
behind him,

51
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:48,340
secretly hate and stab in the back.

52
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:54,740
Oh, I see?

53
00:04:58,580 --> 00:05:01,060
In that case, how could Wu watch him kill the police?

54
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:02,740
He's unlucky.

55
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:05,300
Initially we all agreed to have a drink together.

56
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:07,740
Wu, this poor kid came late.

57
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:11,580
At an alley intersection, he accidentally saw Dao Jian hit the police.

58
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,420
Dao Jian didn't see it clearly either,

59
00:05:14,420 --> 00:05:15,780
only saw a shadow.

60
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,420
However, he continues to suspect Wu.

61
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:21,940
Let's put aside whether Dao Jian suspects Wu.

62
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:25,740
Wu really saw Dao Jian kill the police, right?

63
00:05:26,940 --> 00:05:29,060
Yes, he actually saw it.

64
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,420
This poor child.

65
00:05:56,420 --> 00:05:57,060
Sit down.

66
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:07,660
My sister just returned from abroad,

67
00:06:07,660 --> 00:06:08,900
I want to introduce you.

68
00:06:12,420 --> 00:06:13,700
What are we playing?

69
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:18,940
It's really like a different world.

70
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:20,940
Why did you suddenly come back?

71
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:25,060
The things my silly parents did,

72
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:26,940
talking about it will become a laughing stock for others.

73
00:06:30,100 --> 00:06:30,940
I went to the toilet first.

74
00:06:32,340 --> 00:06:33,700
You used to play bridge cards,

75
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:34,820
don't play this.

76
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:44,340
If you're bored, change to another one.

77
00:06:45,300 --> 00:06:45,860
Sit down.

78
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:48,900
Just sit.

79
00:06:49,900 --> 00:06:52,140
Sister Qiang, sit down and play a round.

80
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:53,060
No, no, no.

81
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:55,060
This I can't, can't play.

82
00:06:55,420 --> 00:06:56,300
I'm old-sighted,

83
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:57,220
also can't see the cards clearly.

84
00:06:57,340 --> 00:06:58,220
Soon, I will have to too

85
00:06:58,300 --> 00:06:59,940
took Leng Tou and Pi Ku away,

86
00:06:59,940 --> 00:07:01,100
and find people.

87
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,260
Looking for who?

88
00:07:02,860 --> 00:07:04,580
The person is completely dead.

89
00:07:07,420 --> 00:07:09,180
What you say is true, Young Master Chi?

90
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,140
His body had been dumped in a rubbish dump.

91
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:15,020
Completely true.

92
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,060
This is information provided by insiders.

93
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:24,740
If it's like this,

94
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:26,100
Sis Qiang doesn't need to rush either.

95
00:07:26,500 --> 00:07:27,060
Sit down.

96
00:07:27,140 --> 00:07:28,420
Play a round, I'll help you look at the cards.

97
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:35,540
Miss Ke is an expert.

98
00:07:40,540 --> 00:07:41,740
I've heard this too.

99
00:07:41,940 --> 00:07:42,580
Ever heard.

100
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:45,180
This little brother turns out to be an expert, huh?

101
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:48,460
Nona.

102
00:07:52,780 --> 00:07:54,620
What's wrong with you?

103
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:02,580
Sorry, if you can tell,

104
00:08:03,780 --> 00:08:04,980
are you an actress?

105
00:08:05,580 --> 00:08:06,980
It looks very familiar.

106
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:15,420
I'm Miss Photogenic from the Sweet Woman beauty pageant,

107
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:16,620
just signed a contract with the studio.

108
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:17,660
No wonder.

109
00:08:17,660 --> 00:08:18,940
You look so familiar.

110
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:21,420
You look more beautiful than on television.

111
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:24,380
I am a lecturer at Nanzhou University.

112
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:26,500
My students also really like you.

113
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:29,220
Can I take a photo with you?

114
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:31,620
Okay, don't post it on Weibo, yeah.

115
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:32,740
Stay cool,

116
00:08:33,100 --> 00:08:34,340
I just wanted to show it to my students.

117
00:08:36,060 --> 00:08:36,620
Ayo.

118
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:44,940
Very beautiful.

119
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:47,380
Can we be friends on WeChat?

120
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,580
I'll send you the photo.

121
00:08:57,060 --> 00:08:58,180
Do we still want to play cards?

122
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,700
Isn't this waiting for you?

123
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:08,620
Let's start.

124
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:13,140
How are your card playing skills?

125
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:14,980
Wouldn't you know after playing a few rounds?

126
00:09:29,780 --> 00:09:31,540
Unfaithful even though he is good to her.

127
00:09:34,540 --> 00:09:35,780
Namun, Gang number,

128
00:09:36,580 --> 00:09:38,220
he continued fishing in the sea.

129
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:39,460
Never left from there.

130
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:43,740
My eyes are open.

131
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:46,260
I'm telling you,

132
00:09:49,660 --> 00:09:50,420
besides him,

133
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,820
there couldn't be anyone else.

134
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:56,780
You mean...

135
00:09:57,020 --> 00:09:58,380
Gang bribed by him?

136
00:10:01,060 --> 00:10:03,380
Gang is not necessarily bribed by him,

137
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:05,540
just too stupid,

138
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,460
so, fooled by him.

139
00:10:09,020 --> 00:10:09,820
Then, what about money?

140
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:11,900
He also took it?

141
00:10:13,300 --> 00:10:14,780
It's all cash,

142
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,780
moreover, it is not a small amount.

143
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:19,500
Keep an eye on him.

144
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:24,500
It doesn't matter if it's a fox or an evil wolf,

145
00:10:26,380 --> 00:10:27,540
sooner or later

146
00:10:28,500 --> 00:10:30,380
will definitely show its tail.

147
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:40,460
Mr. Feng.

148
00:10:40,620 --> 00:10:41,620
See you soon, Mr. Feng.

149
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:55,220
Men, our own people.

150
00:11:06,580 --> 00:11:07,500
I'll go first, Brother Qiang.

151
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:19,820
Kak Qiang.

152
00:11:29,340 --> 00:11:34,380
We'll take Mrs.... Mrs. Ke home first, right?

153
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:54,540
(surface)

154
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:02,740
Halo.

155
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:05,660
Ying Ying, you're not home?

156
00:12:07,540 --> 00:12:09,460
There is a student in my class whose birthday,

157
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:11,020
I went out with them.

158
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:15,540
I'm feeling a little tired today, so I changed shifts with a colleague.

159
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:17,300
Why haven't you come home yet?

160
00:12:17,540 --> 00:12:18,860
Do I need to pick you up?

161
00:12:18,900 --> 00:12:20,460
No need, Yuze. No need.

162
00:12:21,380 --> 00:12:22,580
I'll be back in a moment.

163
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,580
I just want to see,

164
00:12:34,660 --> 00:12:36,540
how can you lie so calmly.

165
00:13:01,020 --> 00:13:01,780
What is it?

166
00:13:02,300 --> 00:13:03,740
Do you still want to stay with me for a while?

167
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:09,740
Can I go already?

168
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,340
Of course.

169
00:13:24,940 --> 00:13:26,300
Mr. Feng, is it working?

170
00:13:27,020 --> 00:13:27,820
Wait a minute.

171
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,540
Didn't invite me to sit for a while?

172
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:03,420
If you want me to keep playing this game,

173
00:14:05,420 --> 00:14:07,060
leave a way out for me.

174
00:14:11,500 --> 00:14:12,780
What if I don't leave it?

175
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,820
Please.

176
00:14:29,860 --> 00:14:31,380
I beg you,

177
00:14:32,020 --> 00:14:34,420
Shen Shijie.

178
00:15:15,260 --> 00:15:16,700
Yuze, why don't you turn on the lights?

179
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,100
too bright,

180
00:15:18,380 --> 00:15:19,380
So, I turned it off earlier.

181
00:15:21,500 --> 00:15:22,660
Are you sick?

182
00:15:23,780 --> 00:15:24,660
Let me see.

183
00:15:28,660 --> 00:15:29,580
Why?

184
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:32,540
A little cold,

185
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,060
I've taken medicine.

186
00:15:38,500 --> 00:15:40,100
Then, you go to bed early.

187
00:15:46,700 --> 00:15:47,540
Why?

188
00:15:48,820 --> 00:15:50,380
You should take a shower first.

189
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,620
Some of the boys in my class smoke,

190
00:15:59,860 --> 00:16:01,540
didn't think of me as a lecturer, wasn't reluctant at all.

191
00:16:02,060 --> 00:16:03,700
Maybe I'm too friendly.

192
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,740
I... I'll take a shower first.

193
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:40,980
Mr. Feng.

194
00:16:41,340 --> 00:16:42,980
What do you think he's after?

195
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:46,500
A lecturer.

196
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,980
Apart from that, he also has a girlfriend.

197
00:16:49,540 --> 00:16:50,860
It works quietly like this.

198
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:54,740
Do you think he is after fame or money?

199
00:16:55,820 --> 00:16:56,620
Right, right?

200
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,740
How is your relationship with Dao Jian?

201
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:09,100
Dao Jian, ya?

202
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:12,340
Previously he was my boss.

203
00:17:12,980 --> 00:17:13,980
How can it still be done?

204
00:17:15,540 --> 00:17:16,060
However,

205
00:17:16,580 --> 00:17:18,100
now suddenly know he is dead,

206
00:17:19,380 --> 00:17:20,980
my heart feels very emotional.

207
00:17:22,340 --> 00:17:23,460
What are you emotional about?

208
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:26,260
Such a great person,

209
00:17:26,820 --> 00:17:28,060
just died.

210
00:17:32,420 --> 00:17:33,580
You seem really afraid of him?

211
00:17:35,860 --> 00:17:37,660
Yes, I'm a little...

212
00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,380
afraid of him.

213
00:17:38,660 --> 00:17:39,500
Why?

214
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:49,420
Sis.

215
00:17:51,180 --> 00:17:52,380
I call you "sis",

216
00:17:52,380 --> 00:17:53,100
so, this problem

217
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:54,300
don't ask again.

218
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,620
This is not a good thing.

219
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:00,980
Sparking my curiosity?

220
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:03,020
No, really not.

221
00:18:03,580 --> 00:18:04,940
This is really not a good thing.

222
00:18:04,940 --> 00:18:05,860
There's no benefit to you.

223
00:18:07,780 --> 00:18:09,620
Apart from that, Brother Qiang previously kept telling me,

224
00:18:09,620 --> 00:18:12,020
This matter must be kept secret, don't tell anyone.

225
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:13,220
If I say it it will definitely cause trouble.

226
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:14,780
you see,

227
00:18:15,500 --> 00:18:17,060
now Dao Jian is dead.

228
00:18:17,700 --> 00:18:19,140
I want to forget about this completely.

229
00:18:20,100 --> 00:18:21,220
Don't ask again.

230
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:56,260
Not asleep yet?

231
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:03,740
Why?

232
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,300
Still sick?

233
00:19:06,260 --> 00:19:06,940
Ying Ying.

234
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:09,980
What do you think I am

235
00:19:10,820 --> 00:19:12,020
very boring?

236
00:19:15,020 --> 00:19:16,820
I'm very busy all day,

237
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,540
absolutely no time to accompany you and give you attention.

238
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:23,100
No.

239
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:31,460
I know I still have many shortcomings.

240
00:19:36,580 --> 00:19:38,780
However, do you still remember what we said?

241
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:42,860
We are not just lovers,

242
00:19:44,100 --> 00:19:45,500
but also have to be friends.

243
00:19:47,660 --> 00:19:49,980
If there is a problem, it will not be left until tomorrow.

244
00:19:51,340 --> 00:19:53,620
Between the two of us, no matter what problems occur,

245
00:19:55,060 --> 00:19:57,940
also don't sulk, don't cover it up.

246
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:00,340
It must be stated straight away,

247
00:20:00,660 --> 00:20:01,820
we discuss the solution.

248
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:03,620
Don't keep it in your heart.

249
00:20:08,700 --> 00:20:12,300
No, there is no problem whatsoever.

250
00:20:13,380 --> 00:20:15,660
You've done very, very well.

251
00:20:18,100 --> 00:20:18,980
Is it true?

252
00:20:22,180 --> 00:20:23,460
However, I always feel...

253
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,860
you're getting further away from me

254
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:30,580
it's you,

255
00:20:31,180 --> 00:20:32,740
Every sick person likes to think strange things.

256
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,340
We've both been busy with work lately,

257
00:20:38,260 --> 00:20:39,620
we rarely see each other.

258
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:48,900
Sorry.

259
00:20:49,540 --> 00:20:51,380
Why apologize?

260
00:20:52,140 --> 00:20:53,980
You're sick to the point of stupid, aren't you?

261
00:20:59,860 --> 00:21:01,340
I still have to check a file,

262
00:21:01,620 --> 00:21:02,420
you sleep first.

263
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:05,660
Follow it.

264
00:21:12,780 --> 00:21:13,580
good night

265
00:21:13,980 --> 00:21:14,860
Go away.

266
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,860
My sister just returned from abroad,

267
00:21:52,860 --> 00:21:54,220
I want to introduce you.

268
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:56,300
What are we playing?

269
00:21:59,180 --> 00:22:00,460
It's really like a different world.

270
00:22:03,900 --> 00:22:05,300
You used to play bridge cards,

271
00:22:05,300 --> 00:22:06,460
don't play this.

272
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:10,140
If you're bored, change to another one.

273
00:22:15,140 --> 00:22:16,180
Feng Xiaosheng.

274
00:22:16,700 --> 00:22:17,860
Feng Ruichi.

275
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,460
Xiaosheng.

276
00:22:21,860 --> 00:22:22,900
Ruichi.

277
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,500
(Feng Ruichi didn't know)

278
00:22:56,500 --> 00:22:58,140
(Feng Xiaosheng itu Shen Shijie.)

279
00:23:28,300 --> 00:23:29,140
Reasonable.

280
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,660
Reasonable.

281
00:23:38,260 --> 00:23:40,180
Still not quick to thank your uncle?

282
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:42,460
Thank you, Uncle.

283
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,140
It's not your fault.

284
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,060
It's your parents' fault that things went wrong,

285
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,700
didn't educate you well.

286
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:55,940
Sister.

287
00:23:55,940 --> 00:23:57,620
It's not fair if you say this.

288
00:23:58,100 --> 00:23:59,980
What did I do to make you blame me?

289
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,700
No, anyway,

290
00:24:02,700 --> 00:24:05,340
If you want to blame, blame my nagging wife.

291
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,300
All day his mouth never stopped.

292
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:09,100
I'm just going out to eat for a bit,

293
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,300
he was already shouting that he wanted to catch the whole world infidelity.

294
00:24:11,300 --> 00:24:12,500
Shut up.

295
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:14,780
I'm home now,

296
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:19,020
stay at home for a few days before leaving.

297
00:24:21,900 --> 00:24:23,300
Be good friends with your mother,

298
00:24:24,300 --> 00:24:25,900
he's the one having trouble.

299
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:27,700
Good.

300
00:24:34,220 --> 00:24:35,220
Everything is gone.

301
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,020
Ayah.

302
00:24:44,420 --> 00:24:45,020
Second Uncle.

303
00:24:45,420 --> 00:24:46,140
I go first.

304
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,780
Sheng stayed behind.

305
00:24:52,300 --> 00:24:53,380
There's something I want to talk about.

306
00:25:00,860 --> 00:25:01,620
I'll go first, Uncle.

307
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:57,420
I heard you changed drivers.

308
00:25:58,420 --> 00:25:59,180
Is it true?

309
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,420
Of.

310
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:03,020
Gang doesn't know the way.

311
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,860
Never mind other places,

312
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:05,620
this is your place,

313
00:26:05,900 --> 00:26:07,020
I've come here 10 thousand times,

314
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,860
still going the wrong way.

315
00:26:14,260 --> 00:26:15,420
This kid's gang,

316
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,300
It's a little stupid.

317
00:26:20,740 --> 00:26:21,780
I remember that time...

318
00:26:22,780 --> 00:26:25,740
his father died saving me.

319
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
He has two sons.

320
00:26:29,860 --> 00:26:31,100
His first son Hi,

321
00:26:32,340 --> 00:26:33,860
followed Sheng for nine years.

322
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:36,380
Always faithful.

323
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,540
Gang

324
00:26:40,300 --> 00:26:41,620
is an orphan.

325
00:26:42,220 --> 00:26:43,540
Hey that's amazing.

326
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,980
I told Gang to follow you,

327
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:50,660
because I think

328
00:26:51,180 --> 00:26:53,020
this kid has no evil intentions,

329
00:26:54,300 --> 00:26:55,460
just have a loyal heart.

330
00:26:59,140 --> 00:27:00,020
You have to remember.

331
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:02,540
The people you work with...

332
00:27:04,100 --> 00:27:05,660
there are many smart ones,

333
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:07,860
that you don't have yet...

334
00:27:09,180 --> 00:27:10,500
is an honest person.

335
00:27:31,220 --> 00:27:32,020
Thank you for the advice.

336
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:55,980
Fine, fine, fine.

337
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,260
I'll go there right now.

338
00:27:59,460 --> 00:28:00,180
My son,

339
00:28:00,180 --> 00:28:01,100
You go home alone, okay?

340
00:28:07,540 --> 00:28:08,300
Where are you going?

341
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,500
Go to the company.

342
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:12,300
No need to go to the company.

343
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,220
I rarely come home

344
00:28:13,460 --> 00:28:14,500
accompany me to play.

345
00:28:15,300 --> 00:28:16,260
Serious matters are more important.

346
00:28:20,460 --> 00:28:21,620
Playing is also serious business.

347
00:28:29,540 --> 00:28:31,020
Do you see the car ahead?

348
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,300
Second uncle's car.

349
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:38,540
Follow, don't get caught.

350
00:28:40,140 --> 00:28:40,780
Good.

351
00:28:43,860 --> 00:28:44,460
Good.

352
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:45,540
Good.

353
00:29:07,020 --> 00:29:08,020
(School)

354
00:29:17,580 --> 00:29:19,580
This is information provided by insiders.

355
00:29:23,060 --> 00:29:23,740
Road.

356
00:29:24,620 --> 00:29:25,220
Sis.

357
00:29:25,780 --> 00:29:26,580
The car in front is a bit,

358
00:29:26,860 --> 00:29:28,140
If you continue following him, he's afraid he'll get caught.

359
00:29:31,300 --> 00:29:32,140
If so, just go home.

360
00:29:41,140 --> 00:29:42,460
- I consider you my best friend, - What are you doing?

361
00:29:42,500 --> 00:29:43,860
- How could you do that to me! - No.

362
00:29:44,900 --> 00:29:45,700
You too!

363
00:29:45,700 --> 00:29:46,340
You listen to my explanation!

364
00:29:46,340 --> 00:29:47,460
You are both liars!

365
00:29:47,460 --> 00:29:48,660
- Stop! - Big liar!

366
00:29:48,660 --> 00:29:49,300
Stop! Stop!

367
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:51,980
Nona,

368
00:29:52,260 --> 00:29:53,540
what's with your acting?

369
00:29:54,300 --> 00:29:55,860
Again, dodging too quickly, you know?

370
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:57,020
How many times has this been?

371
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,540
It's been there many times, it's over, isn't it?

372
00:29:58,860 --> 00:29:59,780
I understand, Director.

373
00:30:00,340 --> 00:30:01,020
Son.

374
00:30:01,020 --> 00:30:01,420
Ya, ya, ya.

375
00:30:01,420 --> 00:30:02,100
Have you taught him yet?

376
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:02,540
Stop it.

377
00:30:02,540 --> 00:30:03,140
Sorry, Director.

378
00:30:03,140 --> 00:30:04,100
I asked for close-up highlights earlier.

379
00:30:04,100 --> 00:30:04,980
Don't talk nonsense, do it quickly.

380
00:30:04,980 --> 00:30:05,500
Sorry, Director.

381
00:30:05,500 --> 00:30:06,100
Sorry, sorry.

382
00:30:06,100 --> 00:30:06,420
I am wrong.

383
00:30:06,940 --> 00:30:07,380
Pak,

384
00:30:07,380 --> 00:30:08,220
we do it according to this.

385
00:30:08,220 --> 00:30:09,060
Execute according to close-up.

386
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:12,020
Thank you sir.

387
00:30:19,220 --> 00:30:19,900
Nona.

388
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:21,380
Sorry, this place is not accessible.

389
00:30:22,380 --> 00:30:23,580
I'm a friend Yes Yes.

390
00:30:23,740 --> 00:30:24,900
I want to look for it for a while.

391
00:30:25,100 --> 00:30:26,540
OK, no problem, go ahead.

392
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,220
Thank You.

393
00:30:30,340 --> 00:30:31,540
Bu Ke.

394
00:30:31,540 --> 00:30:32,180
Ya Ya.

395
00:30:32,180 --> 00:30:33,460
Why did you come?

396
00:30:33,740 --> 00:30:35,620
My students all like you very much.

397
00:30:35,820 --> 00:30:37,780
They forced me to deliver gifts to their idols.

398
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,580
Thank you, thank you.

399
00:30:39,740 --> 00:30:41,060
They are too shy.

400
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:42,860
Thank you.

401
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,340
Here, put it well.

402
00:30:45,620 --> 00:30:46,740
How long will it take to shoot?

403
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:48,820
One more scene is over.

404
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,780
can i see it

405
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,340
Don't worry, I won't take a photo,

406
00:30:54,340 --> 00:30:55,580
I won't upload it on WeChat or Weibo.

407
00:30:55,980 --> 00:30:56,580
Okay.

408
00:30:56,660 --> 00:30:57,860
Then, you sit here.

409
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:01,140
Sis Yes Yes, you are asked to go to the location.

410
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:02,020
Fine.

411
00:31:02,500 --> 00:31:03,300
You stay here.

412
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:03,700
- Don't wander off. - Sis Yes Yes.

413
00:31:03,700 --> 00:31:04,460
OK, calm down.

414
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:05,460
We have to change into other shoes, right?

415
00:31:05,460 --> 00:31:06,940
No need to wear shoes, the shoes are not highlighted.

416
00:31:14,260 --> 00:31:15,700
You ungrateful bastard!

417
00:31:15,700 --> 00:31:16,900
Lied to me this much!

418
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:17,620
Not me...

419
00:31:17,620 --> 00:31:20,060
From now on, we have nothing to do with each other!

420
00:31:20,740 --> 00:31:21,260
I...

421
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:23,500
Tong Tong!

422
00:31:23,940 --> 00:31:25,460
I don't want to see you again!

423
00:31:26,900 --> 00:31:28,700
Tong Tong! Jing Jing!

424
00:31:33,380 --> 00:31:35,980
No!

425
00:31:37,780 --> 00:31:38,460
Well, stop!

426
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,860
Director Peng, is there a problem?

427
00:31:42,940 --> 00:31:43,500
There isn't any.

428
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:45,140
If there are no further problems, thank you, everyone.

429
00:31:45,460 --> 00:31:46,060
You guys have worked hard.

430
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,020
Thank you to all of you.

431
00:31:47,020 --> 00:31:47,980
Everyone has worked hard.

432
00:31:47,980 --> 00:31:48,700
Thank you, Director.

433
00:31:48,700 --> 00:31:49,980
- Have you finished filming? - Director, how is it?

434
00:31:49,980 --> 00:31:50,740
Just normal.

435
00:31:50,740 --> 00:31:51,700
Where did you get the actress?

436
00:31:51,700 --> 00:31:52,700
The acting is really bad.

437
00:31:53,100 --> 00:31:53,540
You don't get angry.

438
00:31:53,540 --> 00:31:54,420
Your acting is very good.

439
00:31:54,420 --> 00:31:55,820
He's an internet celebrity, quite popular.

440
00:31:56,060 --> 00:31:57,660
Will benefit our drama.

441
00:31:57,780 --> 00:32:01,220
Later, will you come with the crew car to go home and rest at the hotel?

442
00:32:01,540 --> 00:32:02,620
I don't stay in hotels,

443
00:32:02,980 --> 00:32:04,140
Ruichi came to pick me up.

444
00:32:04,500 --> 00:32:05,180
It's been a long time since I've chatted.

445
00:32:05,180 --> 00:32:06,060
I'll change clothes first.

446
00:32:06,060 --> 00:32:06,580
Good.

447
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,420
- You guys have worked hard. - Thank You.

448
00:32:20,660 --> 00:32:21,540
You see.

449
00:32:26,060 --> 00:32:26,940
my love

450
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:29,300
Miss me, don't you?

451
00:32:29,300 --> 00:32:30,060
miss

452
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:33,940
Beautiful Miss Ke,

453
00:32:34,300 --> 00:32:35,260
why are you here too?

454
00:32:36,740 --> 00:32:39,020
I delivered a gift from a Ya Ya fan for him.

455
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,620
I was very tired from filming all day.

456
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:43,340
Come on, go quickly.

457
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:43,860
Ayo.

458
00:32:44,900 --> 00:32:45,700
What are you taking home?

459
00:32:47,980 --> 00:32:49,260
I'll just take a taxi.

460
00:32:50,020 --> 00:32:50,900
Take a taxi?

461
00:32:50,900 --> 00:32:52,180
Isn't this called not giving me face?

462
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:53,260
Come in my car, okay?

463
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:54,580
It doesn't matter.

464
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:56,180
You should also have your own event.

465
00:32:56,180 --> 00:32:57,620
I... I'll just take a taxi.

466
00:32:58,660 --> 00:33:00,100
The first time I didn't know each other, the second time I was familiar.

467
00:33:00,940 --> 00:33:02,020
Don't be shy with me.

468
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:07,780
Please.

469
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,220
If that's the case, I won't hesitate anymore.

470
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:15,300
Slowly.

471
00:33:45,780 --> 00:33:47,260
Young Master Chi rarely returns to China, right?

472
00:33:47,980 --> 00:33:49,980
I rarely hear Mr. Feng talk about you.

473
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,140
Miss Ke, where are you going?

474
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,140
We'll take you there.

475
00:33:53,260 --> 00:33:54,060
Do not bother.

476
00:33:54,140 --> 00:33:55,580
You guys should have an event after this, right?

477
00:33:55,980 --> 00:33:57,780
Please just drop me off at the MRT station entrance.

478
00:33:58,060 --> 00:33:59,260
Where can that be?

479
00:33:59,580 --> 00:34:00,900
If my sister finds out,

480
00:34:01,260 --> 00:34:02,340
how do I explain it?

481
00:34:03,100 --> 00:34:05,140
It was unexpected that the relationship between the two of you was so good.

482
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:10,460
I thought brothers from rich families only got along on the outside

483
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:12,660
and obsessed with fighting over wealth.

484
00:34:14,020 --> 00:34:15,500
You watch too many dramas, huh?

485
00:34:34,340 --> 00:34:35,180
Here, right?

486
00:34:42,780 --> 00:34:43,580
It's coming down slowly.

487
00:34:48,660 --> 00:34:49,380
Why?

488
00:34:50,220 --> 00:34:51,420
It looks like my foot has sprained.

489
00:34:54,940 --> 00:34:55,860
Bu Ke,

490
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:58,140
Your acting is better than mine apparently.

491
00:35:01,020 --> 00:35:02,100
Why do your feet sprain?

492
00:35:02,980 --> 00:35:03,700
It doesn't matter.

493
00:35:03,900 --> 00:35:05,140
It's just an old wound.

494
00:35:05,780 --> 00:35:07,220
This will get better after applying medicine later.

495
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:08,700
If so, I'll take you up.

496
00:35:09,500 --> 00:35:10,340
No need.

497
00:35:11,300 --> 00:35:12,340
Absolutely no need.

498
00:35:12,620 --> 00:35:13,860
No need to be shy with me.

499
00:35:14,060 --> 00:35:14,700
Ayo.

500
00:35:18,140 --> 00:35:18,940
Slowly, slowly.

501
00:35:22,620 --> 00:35:23,100
Be careful.

502
00:35:23,100 --> 00:35:23,980
Slowly, slowly.

503
00:35:36,540 --> 00:35:37,500
Put me down quickly.

504
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:41,900
You quickly put me down, it's not good if other people see me.

505
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,460
What's not good?

506
00:35:54,620 --> 00:35:55,860
Thank you for taking me home.

507
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,180
You hurry down.

508
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:59,300
Yes Yes is waiting for you.

509
00:35:59,780 --> 00:36:00,780
If that's the case, just let him wait.

510
00:36:04,060 --> 00:36:05,740
You don't seem that afraid of your brother either.

511
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,620
Just don't be afraid,

512
00:36:07,980 --> 00:36:09,020
why should I be afraid?

513
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:10,620
How could I not be afraid?

514
00:36:10,980 --> 00:36:12,260
I'm so scared of him.

515
00:36:14,380 --> 00:36:15,820
Then, are you afraid of me?

516
00:36:16,820 --> 00:36:18,020
Why am I afraid of you?

517
00:36:18,780 --> 00:36:20,580
Besides, you are not the chairman of the Feng Group.

518
00:36:21,420 --> 00:36:22,460
I am also surnamed Feng.

519
00:36:25,060 --> 00:36:26,540
Many people are surnamed Feng.

520
00:36:27,260 --> 00:36:28,260
Feng Xiaosheng,

521
00:36:29,180 --> 00:36:31,540
he is worth hundreds of billions and owns the Feng Group.

522
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,380
Meanwhile, you?

523
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:34,140
What do you have?

524
00:36:37,660 --> 00:36:39,140
Now I don't have one,

525
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,780
That doesn't mean there won't be any in the future.

526
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,620
Are you angry?

527
00:36:47,540 --> 00:36:48,540
What do you mean?

528
00:36:50,060 --> 00:36:51,540
Can't you just give me a phone number?

529
00:37:01,940 --> 00:37:02,940
Wait for it.

530
00:37:11,620 --> 00:37:12,660
Hurry down.

531
00:37:13,340 --> 00:37:14,660
Don't keep him waiting long.

532
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:16,380
Come on, talk on the phone in your free time.

533
00:37:17,060 --> 00:37:18,020
I'll call you.

534
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:39,180
What's wrong, my big lady?

535
00:37:41,420 --> 00:37:43,140
Why don't you get in the car?

536
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:47,580
Fine, fine, fine. Come on, come on, come on.

537
00:37:48,140 --> 00:37:49,180
Go up.

538
00:37:55,180 --> 00:37:57,420
I will take you to eat delicious food.

539
00:37:58,580 --> 00:37:59,700
Don't be mad anymore, yeah.

540
00:38:03,540 --> 00:38:04,900
There is a French food restaurant around here.

541
00:38:05,780 --> 00:38:07,220
My relationship with the boss is very good.

542
00:39:20,300 --> 00:39:22,100
(School)

543
00:39:24,020 --> 00:39:25,300
It's all rubbish.

544
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:37,140
The party insisted again.

545
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:40,740
This time it won't be easy to handle.

546
00:39:42,060 --> 00:39:44,740
His greed grew bigger and bigger.

547
00:39:46,620 --> 00:39:47,980
They have said it openly.

548
00:39:48,500 --> 00:39:50,860
They ask us to send money to an overseas account.

549
00:39:51,620 --> 00:39:53,660
I think they want to escape,

550
00:39:54,340 --> 00:39:55,980
So, ask for pension money in the future.

551
00:39:58,980 --> 00:40:00,940
They have also reached a dead end.

552
00:40:01,780 --> 00:40:03,780
Don't even pay attention to ethics and manners anymore.

553
00:40:05,860 --> 00:40:07,340
The money that comes out cannot be touched.

554
00:40:08,260 --> 00:40:09,220
We have to be alert.

555
00:40:10,460 --> 00:40:13,060
Don't get dragged by it and trouble yourself.

556
00:40:15,620 --> 00:40:16,980
If so, where does the money come from?

557
00:40:17,340 --> 00:40:18,460
Besides, how to send it?

558
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:20,300
One hundred million US dollars.

559
00:40:20,540 --> 00:40:21,620
That's not a small amount.

560
00:40:30,940 --> 00:40:31,580
Eat a little.

561
00:40:32,140 --> 00:40:33,340
Try your Sis Qiang's cooking.

562
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:38,980
Wu, what's wrong with you?

563
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,660
What's the problem with drinking beer all the time?

564
00:40:41,660 --> 00:40:42,860
Drink slowly.

565
00:40:45,700 --> 00:40:46,660
Kak Qiang.

566
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,700
Is Dao Jian really dead?

567
00:40:54,060 --> 00:40:54,900
Must be dead.

568
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,300
Young Master Chi said it.

569
00:40:58,260 --> 00:40:59,740
How could Young Master Chi know?

570
00:41:01,820 --> 00:41:02,620
How could he know?

571
00:41:02,620 --> 00:41:05,300
He knew from his second uncle, his father.

572
00:41:10,820 --> 00:41:12,020
Slowly, slowly.

573
00:41:13,220 --> 00:41:14,500
Tell me if there's something.

574
00:41:17,380 --> 00:41:18,860
I just don't understand.

575
00:41:20,540 --> 00:41:23,260
How do you think second uncle could know so clearly?

576
00:41:24,380 --> 00:41:25,540
Don't...

577
00:41:26,580 --> 00:41:28,700
does he have someone inside the police?

578
00:41:30,860 --> 00:41:32,540
Isn't that nonsense?

579
00:41:34,140 --> 00:41:35,140
Don't have anyone inside...

580
00:41:35,980 --> 00:41:37,420
if you don't have insiders, what is the Feng family

581
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:39,500
can you have a position like now?

582
00:41:40,380 --> 00:41:42,100
Not only do they have insiders in the police,

583
00:41:42,220 --> 00:41:44,820
behind them there was even a big brain protecting them.

584
00:41:47,540 --> 00:41:48,340
What are they after?

585
00:41:49,220 --> 00:41:50,580
Aiming at what? This.

586
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,380
The people who protect them.

587
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:56,020
What else are you aiming for?

588
00:41:56,540 --> 00:41:57,820
Of course aiming for money.

589
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:00,980
You're quite smart,

590
00:42:01,140 --> 00:42:02,500
but still too young.

591
00:42:02,740 --> 00:42:04,020
Exercise slowly.

592
00:42:04,500 --> 00:42:05,540
This.

593
00:42:05,740 --> 00:42:07,220
Do you think these people...

594
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:09,380
are they not afraid?

595
00:42:10,740 --> 00:42:11,860
Afraid of what?

596
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:17,300
Afraid of themselves being arrested.

597
00:42:19,380 --> 00:42:21,740
Afraid of feeling guilty on their own conscience.

598
00:42:27,980 --> 00:42:29,140
Conscience?

599
00:42:30,020 --> 00:42:31,620
What is conscience?

600
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:34,340
Is that meat or vegetables?

601
00:42:34,860 --> 00:42:36,020
Can it be eaten?

602
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,500
Can it be drunk like beer?

603
00:42:52,140 --> 00:42:54,060
However, looking around, it's pretty straight too.

604
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:55,860
Right, right?

605
00:42:59,020 --> 00:43:00,700
No, who do you see is straight enough?

606
00:43:03,620 --> 00:43:04,860
You.
