1
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,940
=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 40=

3
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:34,850
From the start I knew you had the ability.

4
00:01:34,850 --> 00:01:36,410
Look, I'm right, right?

5
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,650
Young Master Chi,

6
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:38,890
You're making fun of me again?

7
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:40,290
I'm serious.

8
00:01:40,450 --> 00:01:41,330
Wu.

9
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,050
You came just on time.

10
00:01:44,090 --> 00:01:45,130
I saw Young Master Chi

11
00:01:45,130 --> 00:01:46,090
tired of being here.

12
00:01:46,250 --> 00:01:47,210
You accompany him

13
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:48,490
walk down.

14
00:01:49,130 --> 00:01:49,890
Good.

15
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:51,970
See, he really understands me the most,

16
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:52,850
I've had enough since then.

17
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:53,970
Come on, come on, come on.

18
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,210
Wu.

19
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:26,010
Be good friends.

20
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:48,130
Try asking.

21
00:02:50,930 --> 00:02:52,090
How much do you pay before you can be released?

22
00:02:52,770 --> 00:02:53,690
How much?

23
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:17,570
You're great too,

24
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:19,770
in just such a short time,

25
00:03:20,170 --> 00:03:21,530
you have become his right hand.

26
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:23,650
You do have the ability.

27
00:03:25,090 --> 00:03:26,090
What ability?

28
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,610
The boss just feeds.

29
00:03:55,490 --> 00:03:56,450
At home earlier,

30
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:57,690
I know Ba Lian.

31
00:03:58,970 --> 00:04:00,450
Who guards the door?

32
00:04:01,370 --> 00:04:02,650
He seems like a great person.

33
00:04:03,610 --> 00:04:04,730
That person was Ba Song,

34
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:07,290
he is Dan Yue's assistant.

35
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:14,170
How much benefit did he give you

36
00:04:14,170 --> 00:04:15,290
so you follow him?

37
00:04:16,130 --> 00:04:16,890
Following the boss

38
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,450
no need for profit, right?

39
00:04:19,850 --> 00:04:20,810
That's it.

40
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:21,730
I'm telling you, yeah.

41
00:04:21,730 --> 00:04:22,850
Without giving you any profit,

42
00:04:23,490 --> 00:04:24,530
did you come here?

43
00:04:24,970 --> 00:04:26,050
to find dead, huh?

44
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:28,970
Young Master Chi,

45
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,850
I'm really not here for the money.

46
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,730
Then tell me, for what sake?

47
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:45,170
You should know,

48
00:04:46,490 --> 00:04:48,570
be it Dan Yue or Feng Xiaosheng,

49
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:50,690
they all just want to take advantage of you.

50
00:04:51,810 --> 00:04:52,850
If you were here,

51
00:04:53,290 --> 00:04:53,970
then your life

52
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:55,130
enters the countdown.

53
00:04:56,290 --> 00:04:57,370
Only by returning to the homeland,

54
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:58,850
you can just live.

55
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:04,530
Who are you?

56
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:07,130
Who I am, it doesn't matter.

57
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:08,850
The important thing is

58
00:05:08,850 --> 00:05:10,370
how to take you away from here,

59
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:12,370
instead of falling into the hands of Feng Xiaosheng.

60
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,290
Feng Xiaosheng apanya?

61
00:05:16,370 --> 00:05:17,530
Shen Shijie, 'kan?

62
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,570
Did you know?

63
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:22,850
I just found out not long ago.

64
00:05:24,090 --> 00:05:25,130
Before my father was caught,

65
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:26,250
he told me.

66
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,450
Your father was taken advantage of by Big Boss Feng,

67
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:32,290
that's why you become

68
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:33,650
like now.

69
00:05:40,370 --> 00:05:41,370
Spy?

70
00:05:41,850 --> 00:05:42,810
Why?

71
00:05:43,730 --> 00:05:44,650
Not similar?

72
00:05:46,130 --> 00:05:46,970
Not similar.

73
00:05:51,850 --> 00:05:53,050
Now it's similar.

74
00:05:56,530 --> 00:05:58,290
Then, can you tell me,

75
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:00,850
how do we go

76
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:03,010
Do you have a cell phone?

77
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:03,850
Don't have.

78
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:17,810
I have it?

79
00:06:19,210 --> 00:06:20,050
Already.

80
00:06:22,490 --> 00:06:24,010
You are really interesting.

81
00:06:24,330 --> 00:06:25,210
I'm telling you,

82
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:27,170
he had been following Dan Yue for a long time.

83
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:29,170
He must have a cell phone.

84
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:30,490
Think of a way to take it.

85
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,810
Make it...

86
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:35,850
drunk?

87
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:37,490
There's not enough time.

88
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:41,730
Just simple and rude.

89
00:06:43,570 --> 00:06:44,370
I'm counting on you.

90
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:02,610
Come quickly and help me.

91
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:03,610
Why stand there?

92
00:07:21,850 --> 00:07:22,490
Here.

93
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:26,090
You can too.

94
00:07:26,610 --> 00:07:27,210
Interesting.

95
00:07:27,210 --> 00:07:28,010
Great.

96
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:30,490
Young Master Chi, it's not like I want to call you names,

97
00:07:31,570 --> 00:07:32,850
Turns out you're pretty useless, huh?

98
00:07:34,530 --> 00:07:35,770
Are you the second uncle's biological daughter?

99
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:36,850
Of course, biological children.

100
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:37,930
As for fighting, me too

101
00:07:37,930 --> 00:07:39,130
no need to intervene yourself.

102
00:08:02,530 --> 00:08:03,370
Kapten Xiao.

103
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:05,450
We can't go on either

104
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,370
waiting like this.

105
00:08:07,210 --> 00:08:08,050
Kapten Xiao,

106
00:08:08,050 --> 00:08:09,330
we can't wait any longer.

107
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:11,170
First, who knows when

108
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:12,250
the rescue team will come.

109
00:08:12,530 --> 00:08:13,610
Even though they come,

110
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,530
How to

111
00:08:14,530 --> 00:08:15,570
heading to the island in broad daylight like this?

112
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:17,010
I was afraid when I got on the ship,

113
00:08:17,010 --> 00:08:17,770
Feng Xiaosheng and others

114
00:08:17,770 --> 00:08:19,170
immediately ran away after hearing the news.

115
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:22,890
I have calculations.

116
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,170
Halo.

117
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:35,170
Wu?

118
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:37,410
Correct.

119
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:39,690
Shen Shijie dan Ba ​​Song, bawahan Dan Yue,

120
00:08:39,690 --> 00:08:40,810
have met in person.

121
00:08:41,330 --> 00:08:42,650
I'm afraid they are already in cahoots.

122
00:08:43,570 --> 00:08:44,250
Now I

123
00:08:44,250 --> 00:08:46,210
had to take Feng Ruichi away immediately.

124
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:47,010
Besides that,

125
00:08:47,370 --> 00:08:48,490
Kun disappeared.

126
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,170
Shen Shijie must still have a way out.

127
00:08:50,450 --> 00:08:51,570
Say what's important. Say what's important.

128
00:08:52,010 --> 00:08:52,930
When will the police arrive?

129
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:53,930
How do we escape?

130
00:08:53,930 --> 00:08:54,690
Don't rush.

131
00:08:55,010 --> 00:08:55,650
Besides that,

132
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:57,090
Ke Ying was still trapped in the hotel room

133
00:08:57,090 --> 00:08:58,010
at the very end on the second floor.

134
00:08:58,130 --> 00:08:59,130
You guys save him first.

135
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:00,450
Just that,

136
00:09:00,570 --> 00:09:01,250
I have to go.

137
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,330
Police Su,

138
00:09:08,690 --> 00:09:09,890
We discussed it earlier.

139
00:09:10,370 --> 00:09:12,170
We plan to infiltrate the hotel first.

140
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:12,770
can't,

141
00:09:12,770 --> 00:09:13,570
it's too dangerous.

142
00:09:13,570 --> 00:09:14,650
Even if it's dangerous, you still have to go.

143
00:09:15,410 --> 00:09:16,930
Otherwise, we are too passive.

144
00:09:24,810 --> 00:09:25,290
Xing Wei,

145
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,010
Zhong and I went to the pier first,

146
00:09:27,450 --> 00:09:28,690
and trying to destroy it

147
00:09:28,690 --> 00:09:29,810
all their yachts,

148
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:31,170
so they can't escape.

149
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:32,570
You stay here,

150
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:34,250
pay attention and observe the situation around Ke Ying.

151
00:09:34,370 --> 00:09:35,010
Remember.

152
00:09:35,370 --> 00:09:36,370
You have to be careful.

153
00:09:36,370 --> 00:09:37,010
Good.

154
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:38,290
Ayo.

155
00:09:52,690 --> 00:09:53,690
Look at their clothes.

156
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:56,130
They had a gun in their clothes.

157
00:09:57,410 --> 00:09:59,810
I think more than ten people.

158
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,250
If you run

159
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:04,010
over there now,

160
00:10:04,290 --> 00:10:05,650
you will definitely be shot dead.

161
00:10:06,890 --> 00:10:07,450
Are you

162
00:10:07,450 --> 00:10:08,930
still want to see your fiancé?

163
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,690
without me,

164
00:10:31,690 --> 00:10:33,050
you've been arrested by the police.

165
00:10:35,530 --> 00:10:36,370
He said, without it,

166
00:10:36,370 --> 00:10:37,690
You've been arrested by the police.

167
00:10:39,570 --> 00:10:39,810
tell him,

168
00:10:39,810 --> 00:10:41,170
It's not too late to report to the police now.

169
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:45,050
Now you too

170
00:10:45,050 --> 00:10:46,450
can still hand it over to the police.

171
00:10:47,210 --> 00:10:48,090
I think, Mr. Dan Yue

172
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:49,570
need to understand one thing.

173
00:10:50,330 --> 00:10:51,290
All legal documents

174
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:52,410
it's in my hands.

175
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:54,090
Overseas bank safe key

176
00:10:54,090 --> 00:10:54,930
it's in my hands.

177
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,170
The account key is also in my hand.

178
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,610
I'm just the owner of the Feng Group.

179
00:10:59,810 --> 00:11:00,730
That Feng Ruichi

180
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,010
just a boy

181
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:03,010
There he is,

182
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:04,410
I can get money faster.

183
00:11:04,690 --> 00:11:05,290
Without him,

184
00:11:06,450 --> 00:11:07,690
at least wait a few more days.

185
00:11:08,770 --> 00:11:10,330
There's one thing you should know,

186
00:11:10,530 --> 00:11:11,690
all documents,

187
00:11:11,690 --> 00:11:12,890
including bank key,

188
00:11:12,890 --> 00:11:14,010
is in Mr. Feng's hands.

189
00:11:14,170 --> 00:11:15,730
While that Feng Ruichi,

190
00:11:15,730 --> 00:11:18,210
he's a nobody.

191
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:22,650
The owner of the Feng Group is Feng Xiaosheng.

192
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,410
He's dead.

193
00:11:25,810 --> 00:11:27,450
You don't even understand the documents, do you?

194
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:29,810
Translate!

195
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,530
He knows...

196
00:11:42,650 --> 00:11:43,610
kau bukan Feng Xiaosheng,

197
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:45,770
melainkan Shen Shijie.

198
00:11:52,210 --> 00:11:52,730
He says,

199
00:11:53,970 --> 00:11:55,330
you might not even know

200
00:11:55,850 --> 00:11:56,690
what is written in the document.

201
00:11:59,090 --> 00:11:59,970
You think with

202
00:11:59,970 --> 00:12:01,170
changed his appearance to Feng Xiaosheng,

203
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:03,850
then you are the real Master Feng?

204
00:12:05,210 --> 00:12:07,450
You should feel honored,

205
00:12:07,850 --> 00:12:09,850
because you can sit with me.

206
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:16,290
Disgraceful little thug.

207
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:19,530
You're just a little thug.

208
00:12:27,170 --> 00:12:28,690
Half of the Feng family's property.

209
00:12:28,690 --> 00:12:29,850
Just a little less,

210
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,170
don't hope that you can take Feng Ruichi away.

211
00:12:34,610 --> 00:12:36,290
He wants half of all the property.

212
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:38,410
Otherwise, Feng Ruichi could not be taken away.

213
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,170
Half of the Feng Family's property,

214
00:13:33,970 --> 00:13:34,650
in this month

215
00:13:34,650 --> 00:13:36,290
will be transferred to Mr Ba Song's account.

216
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:38,890
I, Shen Shijie, am never stingy.

217
00:13:40,210 --> 00:13:41,770
Especially towards your own friends.

218
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:43,730
It's a friend indeed.

219
00:14:07,010 --> 00:14:07,610
Don't speak up.

220
00:14:09,170 --> 00:14:10,530
Captain Xiao, Ke Ying has been found,

221
00:14:10,530 --> 00:14:11,370
I immediately took him out.

222
00:14:11,610 --> 00:14:12,370
Come on, come with me.

223
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,490
I can't go.

224
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:16,570
You go quickly.

225
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:17,530
Ke Ying!

226
00:14:18,090 --> 00:14:18,930
Go find Wu.

227
00:14:19,330 --> 00:14:20,370
He was helping Feng Ruichi.

228
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:21,610
I helped you first,

229
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:22,730
just went to find Wu.

230
00:14:26,690 --> 00:14:27,570
Shen Shijie memasang bom

231
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,210
in my body.

232
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:29,730
I can't go.

233
00:14:33,490 --> 00:14:34,330
Don't be afraid.

234
00:14:36,130 --> 00:14:36,850
Let me try.

235
00:14:46,250 --> 00:14:46,810
Don't move!

236
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:47,530
Raise your hand.

237
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,810
It's best not to touch the belt carelessly.

238
00:14:50,170 --> 00:14:51,530
If it breaks, it will explode.

239
00:14:56,130 --> 00:14:56,930
Raise your hand.

240
00:15:04,650 --> 00:15:05,210
Don't move!

241
00:15:06,530 --> 00:15:07,130
Possible.

242
00:15:09,330 --> 00:15:10,370
I almost forgot.

243
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,810
The bomb is connected to my veins.

244
00:15:13,970 --> 00:15:15,530
If my pulse stops,

245
00:15:16,970 --> 00:15:18,530
the bomb will still explode.

246
00:15:25,370 --> 00:15:25,930
Shoot it.

247
00:15:26,890 --> 00:15:27,570
Shoot me to death.

248
00:15:29,170 --> 00:15:31,010
That way, I can die together with Ke Ying.

249
00:15:32,450 --> 00:15:33,010
Don't move.

250
00:15:33,690 --> 00:15:34,450
Shoot it.

251
00:15:34,770 --> 00:15:36,010
At least we all die together!

252
00:15:37,850 --> 00:15:39,330
Do you think I don't dare to shoot?

253
00:15:45,090 --> 00:15:45,930
You don't dare.

254
00:15:57,530 --> 00:15:58,090
Gang,

255
00:15:59,650 --> 00:16:00,330
have you forgotten?

256
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:01,410
how could your brother die?

257
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,650
I know who hurt my sister.

258
00:16:06,210 --> 00:16:06,970
Even though I'm stupid,

259
00:16:08,330 --> 00:16:09,770
but I can differentiate between good and bad.

260
00:16:23,130 --> 00:16:24,010
Kapten Xiao?

261
00:16:26,130 --> 00:16:27,050
welcome

262
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:28,370
at our wedding.

263
00:17:02,090 --> 00:17:02,970
Kapten Xiao.

264
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:04,930
What are you doing? Go, hurry!

265
00:17:17,930 --> 00:17:18,490
Fast!

266
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:19,040
They are coming!

267
00:17:27,610 --> 00:17:28,170
Stop!

268
00:17:32,250 --> 00:17:32,770
Stop!

269
00:17:36,130 --> 00:17:36,690
Stop!

270
00:17:42,250 --> 00:17:42,770
Stop!

271
00:18:02,770 --> 00:18:03,530
Hurry up!

272
00:18:23,290 --> 00:18:26,200
(No entry other than employees)

273
00:18:29,170 --> 00:18:30,410
God help me. Come on.

274
00:18:30,530 --> 00:18:31,130
Wait a minute.

275
00:18:31,370 --> 00:18:31,890
What do you want?

276
00:18:31,890 --> 00:18:32,610
Enter.

277
00:18:35,170 --> 00:18:36,050
Hello, Kak Jie.

278
00:18:36,050 --> 00:18:37,010
This is the cell phone I snatched,

279
00:18:37,010 --> 00:18:38,010
Young Master Chi is also with me.

280
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,130
Bawa Feng Ruichi,

281
00:18:39,170 --> 00:18:40,290
immediately to the small pier to the east.

282
00:18:40,690 --> 00:18:41,210
Good.

283
00:18:45,450 --> 00:18:46,490
The small dock to the east?

284
00:18:48,010 --> 00:18:49,490
It's an abandoned ship factory,

285
00:18:50,290 --> 00:18:51,050
there are no ships.

286
00:18:52,210 --> 00:18:52,890
Pier to the east

287
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:53,770
it is a former ship factory.

288
00:18:53,770 --> 00:18:54,850
Try listening to this sound,

289
00:18:54,930 --> 00:18:55,650
can we go there?

290
00:18:59,730 --> 00:19:00,530
When.

291
00:19:03,490 --> 00:19:04,170
Where are you going?

292
00:19:05,490 --> 00:19:06,290
What do you want?

293
00:19:09,610 --> 00:19:10,530
I want to catch Shen Shijie.

294
00:19:10,890 --> 00:19:11,530
Can he be arrested?

295
00:19:11,530 --> 00:19:12,210
by you alone?

296
00:19:12,410 --> 00:19:13,370
What we have to do now

297
00:19:13,370 --> 00:19:14,130
is hiding.

298
00:19:14,290 --> 00:19:15,610
Once it's safe, then we go out.

299
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:20,370
If I don't get there now, he'll run away.

300
00:19:20,770 --> 00:19:22,410
Sooner or later he will be caught by the police.

301
00:19:22,410 --> 00:19:23,530
If you go there now, it's courting death,

302
00:19:23,530 --> 00:19:24,010
do you know?

303
00:19:24,130 --> 00:19:24,730
I know.

304
00:19:26,130 --> 00:19:26,970
However, this time,

305
00:19:27,690 --> 00:19:28,930
I can't let it slip away.

306
00:19:30,450 --> 00:19:31,730
I'm a hostage,

307
00:19:32,010 --> 00:19:33,290
You're a cop, right?

308
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:34,490
You should protect me.

309
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:36,210
Take this

310
00:19:36,530 --> 00:19:37,450
and contact Captain Xiao.

311
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:38,530
tell him,

312
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,410
Shen Shijie ran to the pier on the east side,

313
00:19:40,530 --> 00:19:41,450
ask him to be there to help.

314
00:19:43,210 --> 00:19:43,770
Please, yes.

315
00:19:45,530 --> 00:19:46,250
Wait.

316
00:19:50,490 --> 00:19:51,250
Hold well.

317
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:52,530
Take care of yourself.

318
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,290
Work a little.

319
00:19:54,770 --> 00:19:56,130
Think of it as making up for the crime.

320
00:19:59,490 --> 00:20:00,890
You are so unsolider!

321
00:20:13,770 --> 00:20:15,050
Come along quickly!

322
00:20:15,690 --> 00:20:17,010
Get out! Go! Go!

323
00:21:01,050 --> 00:21:02,130
Calm, calm.

324
00:21:02,130 --> 00:21:03,170
I'm a doctor.

325
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:06,770
Hold this.

326
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:13,330
Excuse me! Excuse me.

327
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:13,850
Xing Wei!

328
00:23:13,850 --> 00:23:14,730
Kapten Xiao. Kapten Xiao.

329
00:23:15,410 --> 00:23:17,250
Shen Shijie took Ke Ying hostage and was about to escape.

330
00:23:17,250 --> 00:23:17,770
Fast!

331
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:20,690
Then, who is this person?

332
00:23:21,370 --> 00:23:22,050
He's fake.

333
00:23:22,650 --> 00:23:23,290
That's Gang.

334
00:23:33,890 --> 00:23:34,610
Kapten Xiao!

335
00:23:36,170 --> 00:23:36,890
Kapten Xiao!

336
00:23:37,490 --> 00:23:38,290
It's me.

337
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:39,450
Don't shoot.

338
00:23:39,930 --> 00:23:42,010
Wu asked me to convey a message to you!

339
00:23:57,050 --> 00:23:57,970
You won't be able to escape.

340
00:24:09,250 --> 00:24:09,890
Kak Jie!

341
00:24:19,370 --> 00:24:20,250
Where is Feng Ruichi?

342
00:24:21,170 --> 00:24:22,450
I accidentally let him escape.

343
00:24:23,490 --> 00:24:24,770
What are you doing?

344
00:24:25,810 --> 00:24:26,410
Sis.

345
00:24:26,850 --> 00:24:27,490
Just kill me!

346
00:24:27,490 --> 00:24:28,370
I'm useless!

347
00:24:29,170 --> 00:24:30,530
What's the point of me killing you?

348
00:24:42,490 --> 00:24:43,210
Go away.

349
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,330
Sis.

350
00:24:53,810 --> 00:24:54,570
Release Ke Ying.

351
00:24:56,290 --> 00:24:57,010
I will keep you company.

352
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,290
Ke Ying.

353
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:05,530
Hurry up.

354
00:25:08,410 --> 00:25:09,210
Go!

355
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:13,690
What are you two

356
00:25:13,690 --> 00:25:14,450
do it behind my back?

357
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:19,250
I consider you as my sister,

358
00:25:19,250 --> 00:25:20,410
you pointed a gun at me?

359
00:25:21,810 --> 00:25:22,530
Sorry,

360
00:25:24,850 --> 00:25:26,010
you and I are not compatible.

361
00:25:29,330 --> 00:25:30,410
Shen Shijie, jangan bergerak!

362
00:25:35,250 --> 00:25:36,410
Don't make me shoot you.

363
00:25:41,690 --> 00:25:42,570
You don't dare.

364
00:26:03,250 --> 00:26:05,170
People who betray me never end well.

365
00:26:08,290 --> 00:26:09,090
Shen Shijie.

366
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:11,490
You committed many crimes,

367
00:26:12,290 --> 00:26:14,410
the one who won't end well is you.

368
00:27:03,090 --> 00:27:03,930
Run!

369
00:27:20,090 --> 00:27:20,930
Don't!

370
00:27:30,090 --> 00:27:31,450
Ying Ying! Ying Ying!

371
00:27:33,210 --> 00:27:34,050
- Ying Ying! - Don't come here!

372
00:27:34,290 --> 00:27:35,210
There's a bomb in my body!

373
00:27:35,770 --> 00:27:36,450
Don't be careless!

374
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,370
Ayo.

375
00:27:40,970 --> 00:27:42,090
Shoot me.

376
00:27:42,610 --> 00:27:43,210
Don't shoot.

377
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,570
Apart from being able to detonate the bomb manually,

378
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:48,050
trigger is also connected

379
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:49,450
with Shen Shijie's heart rate monitor.

380
00:27:55,050 --> 00:27:55,770
Shen Shijie.

381
00:27:56,450 --> 00:27:57,450
The police have

382
00:27:57,450 --> 00:27:58,530
surround this island.

383
00:27:58,690 --> 00:27:59,610
You can't run away anywhere.

384
00:27:59,810 --> 00:28:01,130
