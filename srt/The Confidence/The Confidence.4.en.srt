00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 4=

3
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:41,350
A pedestrian

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,400
who found Mr. Chen at the intersection of Xinglong Road.

5
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:46,800
He didn't dare to get close,

6
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:49,080
but he called the emergency number.

7
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:51,800
However, when the ambulance arrives...

8
00:01:54,990 --> 00:01:55,590
is...

9
00:01:57,160 --> 00:01:58,630
already dying.

10
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:02,760
It couldn't be an ordinary traffic accident.

11
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:04,630
Impossible.

12
00:02:06,080 --> 00:02:07,480
This is definitely premeditated murder.

13
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:09,480
On television there is news about Inspector Chen.

14
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,640
(At the intersection of Xinglong Road Laocheng District,)

15
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:15,920
(based on the results of crime scene processing by the traffic management department,)

16
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:19,000
(The type of accident is a hit and run.)

17
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,560
(A police officer died in this accident.)

18
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:23,280
(Currently, Nanzhou traffic police)

19
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:24,840
(has announced a hotline to collect leads.)

20
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:26,070
(Hopefully the wider community)

21
00:02:26,070 --> 00:02:27,640
(can provide related hints.)

22
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:29,560
(The hotline number is right at the bottom of the screen.)

23
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:31,200
(If you have any related clues,)

24
00:02:31,310 --> 00:02:33,400
(please contact the Traffic Police Accident Handling Unit)

25
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,790
(Nanzhou City Police Station.)

26
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:35,840
(At the same time urgent)

27
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:37,200
(hit and run driver)

28
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,790
(to surrender as soon as possible.)

29
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,200
Don't let me catch him.

30
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:59,100
(Istana Shiji Baifu)

31
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,580
Wu.

32
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:42,540
Wu!

33
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:48,640
Wu!

34
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:53,040
Kak Ku.

35
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:55,520
What are you doing?

36
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:59,360
You're hiding a girl inside, huh?

37
00:05:02,430 --> 00:05:04,300
How many times have I called you?

38
00:05:04,360 --> 00:05:05,200
Not even one was picked up.

39
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,640
I thought you were dead.

40
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:08,080
I didn't hear it.

41
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,080
You did it on purpose, right?

42
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:24,830
The battery is dead.

43
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:29,800
Is the battery dead?

44
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:40,830
Sleeping too much until you're stupid, huh?

45
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:43,520
It doesn't matter.

46
00:05:46,480 --> 00:05:47,110
Hurry, put on your jacket.

47
00:05:47,110 --> 00:05:47,960
Put it on, then we go.

48
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,310
Hurry, hurry.

49
00:06:14,270 --> 00:06:15,760
Sir, please.

50
00:06:15,760 --> 00:06:16,520
Thank You.

51
00:06:16,920 --> 00:06:17,760
Have you used a thick one inside?

52
00:06:17,760 --> 00:06:18,830
Well that's that then.

53
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:21,520
Why so suddenly?

54
00:06:21,990 --> 00:06:23,760
Didn't you say two days ago he's leaving next month?

55
00:06:25,990 --> 00:06:28,480
I heard, it's sponsored by a big company.

56
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,920
Suzhou, Hangzhou,

57
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:32,590
Wuxi, three places.

58
00:06:32,590 --> 00:06:35,310
The food, accommodation and transportation are super luxurious.

59
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:37,640
This time, the management's arrangements were very good.

60
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:38,760
Everyone got on the bus.

61
00:06:38,760 --> 00:06:39,640
Come on, get on the bus.

62
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:41,310
Then, let's go first, okay?

63
00:06:41,310 --> 00:06:42,600
Don't be too tired both of you.

64
00:06:42,780 --> 00:06:43,260
Know, know.

65
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,260
Medicines are in the bag.

66
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:44,620
Know.

67
00:06:44,640 --> 00:06:45,160
It's here.

68
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:47,310
If you don't feel well, you have to call Yang Yuze.

69
00:06:47,640 --> 00:06:48,360
Alright, don't be picky anymore.

70
00:06:48,760 --> 00:06:49,760
Take good care of yourself, okay?

71
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:50,800
Call me when you arrive.

72
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:51,310
Know.

73
00:06:52,680 --> 00:06:53,760
Keep in touch, OK?

74
00:06:55,110 --> 00:06:55,830
Ayo.

75
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:20,960
Hello, Yuze.

76
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:22,110
I just wanted to call you.

77
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:23,200
Ying Ying,

78
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:25,080
Now I want to take a taxi to the airport.

79
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,430
This is the hospital's job.

80
00:07:27,430 --> 00:07:28,960
Told to take part in training in Beijing.

81
00:07:30,760 --> 00:07:32,110
Yes, I'm confused too

82
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,200
why was I suddenly asked to go there as soon as possible.

83
00:07:35,390 --> 00:07:36,710
He said the training was one week.

84
00:07:37,270 --> 00:07:38,710
Do you want to take me to the airport?

85
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:39,870
No need.

86
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:41,040
I'll just take a taxi.

87
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:42,590
I'll call you when I get there.

88
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:44,110
Alright, see you later.

89
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,360
Bu Ke.

90
00:07:57,920 --> 00:07:59,080
Ms. Hou, you're here too, right?

91
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:01,390
This weekend, you also come overtime?

92
00:08:01,390 --> 00:08:02,590
After all, I'm free and idle,

93
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:03,870
So, I came to prepare a lesson plan.

94
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:10,960
Halo.

95
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,520
I'll be right there.

96
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:29,800
Yu Chengbo.

97
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:30,800
Miss Lecturer Ke.

98
00:08:31,040 --> 00:08:31,960
Miss Lecturer, right?

99
00:08:33,150 --> 00:08:34,480
I'm the head security guard here.

100
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:37,630
This student of yours works part-time delivering food at the restaurant next door.

101
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,360
Today, when delivering food here,

102
00:08:39,630 --> 00:08:40,750
as long as the customer is late,

103
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:43,920
she quietly took out a new cell phone and put it in her bag.

104
00:08:44,040 --> 00:08:45,070
He was caught off guard.

105
00:08:45,270 --> 00:08:46,320
I didn't steal the phone.

106
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,360
I have absolutely no idea what's wrong with that phone.

107
00:08:48,830 --> 00:08:49,800
What do you mean?

108
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,240
Based on your words,

109
00:08:51,240 --> 00:08:54,000
Does that mean I put the cellphone in your bag and slandered you?

110
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:56,270
You're the one who lost your phone, huh?

111
00:08:56,270 --> 00:08:57,120
I'm sorry.

112
00:08:57,190 --> 00:08:58,630
There must be a misunderstanding here.

113
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:01,630
You may not know, this kid is usually very well-behaved on campus.

114
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,000
It's impossible to do something like this.

115
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:04,360
What kind of lecturer are you?

116
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:06,630
Come and defend your students.

117
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,510
If his behavior is good,

118
00:09:08,510 --> 00:09:09,750
maybe he stole my cell phone?

119
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:11,560
I didn't steal the phone.

120
00:09:12,270 --> 00:09:12,950
You're the one who seduced me.

121
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:14,190
I don't want to, that's why you slander me.

122
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,440
I seduce you?

123
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:17,150
Seducing someone like you?

124
00:09:17,150 --> 00:09:17,680
Good.

125
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:19,560
If you don't know you're being taken advantage of, I'll just report it to the police.

126
00:09:19,560 --> 00:09:20,590
No, no. Perhaps.

127
00:09:20,590 --> 00:09:21,190
Don't call the police.

128
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:22,120
Please listen to me.

129
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:24,000
Can we talk about it nicely?

130
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,320
What do you think if it's like this?

131
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:25,750
According to me...

132
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:26,440
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

133
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:28,190
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

134
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,560
Tell them to go up first.

135
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,480
What happened?

136
00:09:46,070 --> 00:09:47,480
This student stole his cell phone.

137
00:09:47,480 --> 00:09:48,240
He wants to report to the police.

138
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:49,480
This lecturer won't allow it.

139
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:51,480
I know Mrs. Lecturer Ke.

140
00:09:51,880 --> 00:09:53,120
Because he is Lecturer Ke's student,

141
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:54,800
let him take his disciple back and take care of it himself.

142
00:09:57,320 --> 00:09:58,190
Thank You.

143
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:06,120
Oh yes. Miss Lecturer Ke.

144
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:08,440
I always want to treat you to a meal.

145
00:10:09,190 --> 00:10:10,710
Do you have time tonight?

146
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:12,440
No time.

147
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:14,040
I have an appointment tonight.

148
00:10:16,070 --> 00:10:17,560
You said earlier this student...

149
00:10:17,560 --> 00:10:18,950
This student stole his cell phone.

150
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:19,360
So...

151
00:10:19,480 --> 00:10:20,480
Sorry.

152
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:22,120
I remembered wrong.

153
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:23,120
The promise is tomorrow night.

154
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:26,920
Then, tonight, let me treat you.

155
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:29,070
Good.

156
00:10:29,590 --> 00:10:30,360
See you later tonight.

157
00:10:42,920 --> 00:10:43,680
Bu Ke.

158
00:10:48,070 --> 00:10:48,750
Bu Ke,

159
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:50,590
I really didn't steal his phone.

160
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:52,040
The woman slandered me.

161
00:10:52,040 --> 00:10:54,440
When I delivered his food, he suddenly leaned on me.

162
00:10:54,440 --> 00:10:55,680
He even reached out and started carelessly...

163
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:01,950
Bu Ke?

164
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:04,750
Do you know the chairman of the board of directors?

165
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:08,190
I also don't know whether I know him or not.

166
00:11:12,920 --> 00:11:13,950
Yu Chengbo,

167
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:15,630
are you busy tonight?

168
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:17,240
No.

169
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,680
I plan to invite him to eat somewhere close to campus.

170
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,480
Can you wait for me outside?

171
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:23,830
Can.

172
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:25,710
Then, you find a place and wait nearby.

173
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:27,630
If it's been more than two hours I haven't come out yet,

174
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:28,800
report the police immediately.

175
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:29,830
Bu Ke,

176
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:31,070
is it dangerous?

177
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,560
If it's dangerous, then you don't go.

178
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:35,040
Don't let my problems cause you to...

179
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:36,190
Not because of your problem.

180
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,120
This is my own problem.

181
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:41,360
There are several things I need to find out for clarity.

182
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:52,700
(I have arrived.)

183
00:12:52,820 --> 00:12:55,260
(I see your car. I'm on your left side.)

184
00:12:58,700 --> 00:13:02,180
(Don't worry. I'll be on guard here.)

185
00:13:14,270 --> 00:13:14,950
Bu Ke.

186
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:48,360
Thank You.

187
00:13:51,240 --> 00:13:52,150
Don't worry.

188
00:13:52,950 --> 00:13:54,070
He was standing in front of the door.

189
00:13:54,510 --> 00:13:55,510
There's a beeper next to you.

190
00:13:55,510 --> 00:13:56,830
As soon as you press it, it will come straight in.

191
00:14:14,120 --> 00:14:15,000
Miss Lecturer?

192
00:14:20,590 --> 00:14:22,190
Why are you so afraid of me?

193
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:26,800
I remember,

194
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:29,320
when you saw me for the first time,

195
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,390
I can feel

196
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:33,880
you even stop breathing.

197
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:36,270
That kind of fear...

198
00:14:38,270 --> 00:14:39,390
I'm very curious.

199
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,120
When you first met me, you immediately called me Miss Lecturer Ke.

200
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,190
How come you know my surname?

201
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:03,950
Previously, there were students who greeted you.

202
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:05,710
He called you Mrs. Ke.

203
00:15:08,920 --> 00:15:09,880
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

204
00:15:10,270 --> 00:15:10,830
Halo.

205
00:15:18,270 --> 00:15:19,630
You haven't answered my question.

206
00:15:22,830 --> 00:15:23,830
Why are you afraid of me?

207
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:26,070
Not because...

208
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:30,040
I look like someone, right?

209
00:15:33,150 --> 00:15:34,560
Seven months ago,

210
00:15:36,320 --> 00:15:38,240
I met three robbers.

211
00:15:44,680 --> 00:15:46,070
Who is their boss...

212
00:15:49,070 --> 00:15:50,710
very similar to you.

213
00:15:54,680 --> 00:15:55,920
That incident...

214
00:15:58,070 --> 00:16:00,510
left a huge trauma in my heart.

215
00:16:01,590 --> 00:16:02,360
So,

216
00:16:03,630 --> 00:16:05,390
when i see you,

217
00:16:07,710 --> 00:16:09,000
my attitude will be less good.

218
00:16:11,150 --> 00:16:13,040
Hopefully you can understand that.

219
00:16:13,270 --> 00:16:14,190
No, no.

220
00:16:16,040 --> 00:16:17,510
I should be the one apologizing.

221
00:16:18,390 --> 00:16:19,710
I am, after all

222
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,190
who was similar to that robber boss.

223
00:16:29,750 --> 00:16:30,590
Sorry.

224
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:33,070
It's made you remember something painful.

225
00:16:33,710 --> 00:16:34,510
I apologize.

226
00:16:35,590 --> 00:16:36,590
I don't drink wine.

227
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:42,710
If so, drink water instead of wine.

228
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:16,350
Oh yes.

229
00:17:16,440 --> 00:17:17,840
I haven't explained yet

230
00:17:18,440 --> 00:17:19,960
why do I want to invite you to eat.

231
00:17:23,150 --> 00:17:25,510
Regarding what happened on campus that morning,

232
00:17:25,510 --> 00:17:26,510
I am really, really sorry.

233
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:28,920
Even to the point of spraining you.

234
00:17:29,920 --> 00:17:31,270
As a form of my apology,

235
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:33,920
I have prepared a gift for you.

236
00:17:47,390 --> 00:17:48,270
This is a little intention of my heart.

237
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:50,150
Please accept.

238
00:18:04,110 --> 00:18:05,270
You are too shy.

239
00:18:05,990 --> 00:18:07,870
I can't accept this gift.

240
00:18:08,390 --> 00:18:09,320
Thank You.

241
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,350
Accept it.

242
00:18:43,150 --> 00:18:44,150
Open it and have a look

243
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:46,680
do you like it.

244
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:20,150
3,1415926...

245
00:21:21,040 --> 00:21:22,390
3,1415926...

246
00:21:22,390 --> 00:21:23,680
53589...

247
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:25,750
3,1415926...

248
00:21:25,750 --> 00:21:26,800
53589...

249
00:21:27,150 --> 00:21:28,040
3,14...

250
00:21:28,600 --> 00:21:30,150
3,1415926...

251
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:31,350
53589...

252
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:33,560
79323846...

253
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:34,990
264338...

254
00:21:36,470 --> 00:21:37,840
3,1415926...

255
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,320
79323846...

256
00:21:39,320 --> 00:21:39,990
2643...

257
00:22:16,610 --> 00:22:17,700
I must be crazy.

258
00:22:25,750 --> 00:22:30,750
(Mrs. Ke, the scenery in Suzhou is beautiful.)

259
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:49,250
(Your parents are on holiday happily.)

260
00:22:51,500 --> 00:22:57,500
(Your fiancé Yang Yuze is also quite tired. Training in Beijing wasn't easy.)

261
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:24,860
(No matter when,)

262
00:23:25,560 --> 00:23:27,720
any thoughts or pointers you have,

263
00:23:28,110 --> 00:23:29,800
you can tell us any time.

264
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:31,870
We will definitely appreciate it.

265
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:34,150
Because this is our responsibility.

266
00:24:01,110 --> 00:24:01,870
I remember you.

267
00:24:02,470 --> 00:24:03,720
You work with Officer Chen.

268
00:24:04,200 --> 00:24:04,720
Right, right?

269
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:06,200
Bu Ke.

270
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,960
Halo.

271
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:07,750
What do you need?

272
00:24:08,990 --> 00:24:09,750
Mr Officer,

273
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:11,840
I'm very aware right now.

274
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:14,350
Every word I say right now,

275
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,040
everything is serious.

276
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:18,350
I am responsible for every word I say.

277
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:21,110
Please, I'm listening.

278
00:24:22,680 --> 00:24:23,840
Shen Shijie.

279
00:24:24,080 --> 00:24:25,630
Shen Shijie dia tidak mati.

280
00:24:26,200 --> 00:24:27,800
Now his name is Feng Xiaosheng.

281
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:28,960
Hurry up and catch him.

282
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,960
Mrs. Ke, you said...

283
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:31,870
Shen Shijie.

284
00:24:32,110 --> 00:24:33,110
Shen Shijie dia tidak mati.

285
00:24:33,110 --> 00:24:33,680
Hurry up and catch him.

286
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:34,870
He didn't die.

287
00:24:46,680 --> 00:24:47,320
Come on, Mrs. Ke.

288
00:24:47,320 --> 00:24:47,960
Please sit.

289
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,680
You said earlier,

290
00:24:58,990 --> 00:25:00,270
Shen Shijie tidak mati?

291
00:25:02,320 --> 00:25:04,230
Shen... Shen Shijie tidak mati.

292
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,630
Now his name is Feng Xiaosheng.

293
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:07,750
He's back.

294
00:25:08,150 --> 00:25:09,720
He came back looking for me.

295
00:25:11,390 --> 00:25:13,320
He... came back from where?

296
00:25:13,320 --> 00:25:14,080
So...

297
00:25:16,270 --> 00:25:16,560
I...

298
00:25:17,150 --> 00:25:18,390
I want to see Officer Chen.

299
00:25:18,390 --> 00:25:19,630
Officer Chen knows everything.

300
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:20,680
where is he

301
00:25:20,680 --> 00:25:21,720
I want to see Officer Chen.

302
00:25:22,150 --> 00:25:23,230
Where is Officer Chen?

303
00:25:24,270 --> 00:25:25,350
Where is Officer Chen?

304
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:26,350
The day before yesterday evening,

305
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:28,150
Officer Chen had an accident

306
00:25:28,870 --> 00:25:29,920
and died.

307
00:25:39,560 --> 00:25:40,560
How could that be?

308
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,350
Kak Zhong.

309
00:26:06,110 --> 00:26:07,510
Zhong, this person surrendered and said

310
00:26:07,510 --> 00:26:08,440
he was the one who hit Inspector Chen.

311
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:15,840
Here.

312
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:18,870
Here too.

313
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:21,320
We'll talk inside.

314
00:26:21,320 --> 00:26:21,840
Good.

315
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:39,660
(Mother)

316
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:43,920
Halo.

317
00:26:43,920 --> 00:26:44,560
Ying Ying,

318
00:26:44,800 --> 00:26:46,440
where did you go last night?

319
00:26:46,750 --> 00:26:48,470
You don't answer your cell phone.

320
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:50,440
Your father and I are worried to death.

321
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:51,600
Mother,

322
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:54,040
I...

323
00:26:54,040 --> 00:26:55,270
The important thing is that you're fine.

324
00:26:55,840 --> 00:26:56,560
Me and your father

325
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,390
almost had an accident yesterday.

326
00:26:58,990 --> 00:27:00,110
What happened?

327
00:27:00,630 --> 00:27:03,200
Yesterday when I just returned to the hotel room after taking a walk from outside,

328
00:27:03,510 --> 00:27:04,200
as soon as the door is opened,

329
00:27:04,350 --> 00:27:06,870
The walls of the room were covered in a lot of blood.

330
00:27:07,270 --> 00:27:09,080
On the wall was also written the character "Shen".

331
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,680
We were shocked half to death.

332
00:27:11,080 --> 00:27:13,440
Your father and I didn't dare close our eyes all night.

333
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:15,200
Why are you talking about this?

334
00:27:16,080 --> 00:27:17,510
Don't worry, okay?

335
00:27:17,510 --> 00:27:19,440
Your mother and I are fine.

336
00:27:19,440 --> 00:27:20,750
There isn't anything.

337
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:22,630
You don't need to worry.

338
00:28:02,990 --> 00:28:03,750
Halo.

339
00:28:17,720 --> 00:28:19,040
Where are you?

340
00:28:24,800 --> 00:28:27,750
I... I didn't report it to the police.

341
00:28:29,320 --> 00:28:31,800
You... you don't hurt my parents.

342
00:28:33,630 --> 00:28:34,990
Release them.

343
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,390
You are very smart, Miss Lecturer Ke.

344
00:28:49,560 --> 00:28:51,230
I was drinking with friends.

345
00:28:51,630 --> 00:28:54,560
I also don't know which bastard could possibly ask me to drive.

346
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:58,320
I really don't remember at all.

347
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:01,510
How do you know you've hit someone?

348
00:29:01,510 --> 00:29:03,320
After my hangover wears off,

349
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,150
I saw blood in front of the car.

350
00:29:05,320 --> 00:29:07,110
Why did you just surrender today?

351
00:29:07,630 --> 00:29:09,040
At first I didn't dare.

352
00:29:09,040 --> 00:29:11,350
I also thought, maybe it could be covered.

353
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:14,470
Then, I read on the internet, it said, it was a police officer who died.

354
00:29:14,470 --> 00:29:16,320
So, I guess I won't be able to cover it anymore.

355
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:27,150
Drinks where?

356
00:29:27,150 --> 00:29:28,350
Lao Wang Roasted Kidney Shop,

357
00:29:28,560 --> 00:29:30,990
in the culinary area of ​​Tianjin Road.

358
00:29:31,150 --> 00:29:32,150
How many people?

359
00:29:32,150 --> 00:29:32,750
Three.

360
00:29:32,750 --> 00:29:33,920
Three including you?

361
00:29:33,920 --> 00:29:34,560
Correct.

362
00:29:34,600 --> 00:29:36,230
Can the other two people prove what you said?

363
00:29:36,510 --> 00:29:38,350
We drink together.

364
00:29:38,350 --> 00:29:39,390
What happened next,

365
00:29:39,390 --> 00:29:40,270
they don't know either.

366
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:41,680
Why are you treating them?

367
00:29:41,870 --> 00:29:43,270
My two friends are richer than me,

368
00:29:43,270 --> 00:29:44,320
always treat me.

369
00:29:44,630 --> 00:29:45,680
Then, I thought about it,

370
00:29:45,680 --> 00:29:47,270
can't always be the ones who treat.

371
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:48,470
So, I treated them.

372
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:49,270
As a result...

373
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,350
Where did you hit it?

374
00:29:51,800 --> 00:29:53,630
Laocheng District, Xinglong Road intersection.

375
00:29:53,800 --> 00:29:54,870
Didn't you say you drank too much

376
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:56,230
and don't remember anything?

377
00:29:57,080 --> 00:29:58,990
Indeed... I don't remember.

378
00:29:58,990 --> 00:30:01,440
Then, why can you remember where you hit someone?

379
00:30:01,630 --> 00:30:02,390
I...

380
00:30:02,390 --> 00:30:03,510
I heard from other people afterward.

381
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,470
Who said that?

382
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,320
Who said that...

383
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:07,800
Hear from the news.

384
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:08,750
What news?

385
00:30:09,110 --> 00:30:10,230
What news?

386
00:30:10,230 --> 00:30:11,320
If so, I don't remember.

387
00:30:11,320 --> 00:30:12,390
The one on television.

388
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:18,080
You're lying, right?

389
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:19,720
Bo... lie?

390
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:20,230
I...

391
00:30:20,230 --> 00:30:21,470
why should I lie?

392
00:30:21,470 --> 00:30:22,230
Mr Officer,

393
00:30:22,350 --> 00:30:23,320
if you say I'm lying,

394
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:24,840
that means I don't hit people.

395
00:30:24,840 --> 00:30:25,800
Then, you guys let me go.

396
00:30:25,800 --> 00:30:26,560
Of?

397
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:30,080
Full of crap.

398
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:31,560
You think the police are stupid, don't you?

399
00:30:32,750 --> 00:30:33,960
Suffering evil for whom?

400
00:30:35,510 --> 00:30:36,200
Say it!

401
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:37,230
The police are playing hard to get!

402
00:30:37,320 --> 00:30:38,200
The police are playing hard to get!

403
00:30:38,200 --> 00:30:38,990
Suffering evil for whom?

404
00:30:39,080 --> 00:30:39,680
Say it!

405
00:30:39,680 --> 00:30:40,800
The police are playing hard to get!

406
00:31:05,440 --> 00:31:06,230
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

407
00:31:06,470 --> 00:31:07,510
Today you didn't come to campus.

408
00:31:07,510 --> 00:31:08,390
Fine, right?

409
00:31:08,560 --> 00:31:09,470
I was just about to call you...

410
00:31:09,470 --> 00:31:09,840
Yu Chengbo,

411
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:11,320
thanks for last night, yes.

412
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,110
It's just that my wallet was lost.

413
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:15,990
I don't remember where it disappeared.

414
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:16,990
I just remember,

415
00:31:16,990 --> 00:31:18,560
When I ate, my wallet was still there.

416
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:20,510
It should have been left at the restaurant.

417
00:31:21,150 --> 00:31:22,270
Yesterday, after leaving the restaurant,

418
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:23,510
You immediately go driving the car.

419
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:25,320
I called you, you didn't pick up either.

420
00:31:25,320 --> 00:31:26,470
Then, send me a WeChat.

421
00:31:26,870 --> 00:31:28,110
You said, you've arrived home.

422
00:31:30,600 --> 00:31:31,800
All right. Thank you, yes.

423
00:31:32,150 --> 00:31:32,800
No problem.

424
00:31:53,270 --> 00:31:54,560
Haven't found where it went missing?

425
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:56,270
Not yet.

426
00:31:59,150 --> 00:32:00,440
Are there other CCTV cameras?

427
00:32:00,440 --> 00:32:01,150
The one in the lobby,

428
00:32:01,390 --> 00:32:02,510
the lift?

429
00:32:03,390 --> 00:32:04,470
Can it be seen?

430
00:32:04,470 --> 00:32:05,320
There is CCTV in the lift.

431
00:32:05,840 --> 00:32:06,560
I'll play it for you.

432
00:32:06,800 --> 00:32:07,470
Okay, thank you.

433
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:18,630
Isn't this you?

434
00:32:21,960 --> 00:32:23,040
Is there still footage after that?

435
00:32:23,040 --> 00:32:24,350
I want... I want to see a later one.

436
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:26,440
A little backwards, huh?

437
00:32:31,680 --> 00:32:32,630
Why is it over?

438
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,510
Oh yes.

439
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,270
The CCTV circuit was damaged in the middle of last night.

440
00:32:35,270 --> 00:32:36,800
Just fixed this morning.

441
00:33:19,960 --> 00:33:20,960
Shen Shijie,

442
00:33:23,470 --> 00:33:24,720
you're not dead.

443
00:33:27,270 --> 00:33:28,960
You killed Officer Chen.

444
00:33:31,080 --> 00:33:32,840
You were also the one who terrorized my parents.

445
00:33:33,470 --> 00:33:34,600
You do everything.

446
00:33:37,870 --> 00:33:38,150
Miss Lecturer Ke,

447
00:33:38,150 --> 00:33:39,320
You're recording, right?

448
00:33:41,680 --> 00:33:42,560
Just close it.

449
00:33:43,110 --> 00:33:43,870
There is no point.

450
00:33:50,470 --> 00:33:52,440
CCTV footage in housing, you must have seen it, right?

451
00:33:53,390 --> 00:33:54,630
That's what you did.

452
00:33:55,440 --> 00:33:57,270
Finding the scapegoat is easy.

453
00:33:59,960 --> 00:34:00,960
Turn off your recording.

454
00:34:02,110 --> 00:34:03,080
Just like this,

455
00:34:03,720 --> 00:34:04,320
your family

456
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:05,990
will be safe.

457
00:34:09,800 --> 00:34:11,360
My family is innocent.

458
00:34:11,360 --> 00:34:12,710
However, you are guilty.

459
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,360
You've killed people.

460
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:20,160
I...

461
00:34:20,470 --> 00:34:22,270
I had to

462
00:34:22,710 --> 00:34:24,560
You once said you wouldn't report it to the police.

463
00:34:26,880 --> 00:34:28,510
However, you don't just report it to the police,

464
00:34:29,840 --> 00:34:32,040
but also tell the police what I look like.

465
00:34:33,400 --> 00:34:34,190
Shen Shijie,

466
00:34:34,670 --> 00:34:36,320
if you hate me, just kill me.

467
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:37,560
Don't drag my family down.

468
00:34:38,710 --> 00:34:39,400
No.

469
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:42,230
I won't kill you.

470
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:44,880
What do you really want?

471
00:34:46,710 --> 00:34:47,600
I want to...

472
00:34:50,040 --> 00:34:51,950
let's play a game.

473
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,160
What game?

474
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:01,470
Sheet of paper

475
00:35:03,510 --> 00:35:04,950
pure white,

476
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,470
getting dirty little by little.

477
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:11,120
Then, slowly

478
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:14,120
trampled into the dirty mud.

479
00:35:15,800 --> 00:35:17,270
Very interesting, isn't it?

480
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:21,080
Shen Shijie.

481
00:35:22,670 --> 00:35:23,120
Really.

482
00:35:23,120 --> 00:35:24,080
You just kill me.

483
00:35:24,360 --> 00:35:25,510
You just kill me.

484
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,950
Kill you...

485
00:35:29,230 --> 00:35:30,750
killing you is too easy.

486
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:32,800
Too light for you.

487
00:35:34,120 --> 00:35:36,360
I want us to play this game well.

488
00:35:37,560 --> 00:35:39,040
The rules are very simple.

489
00:35:39,640 --> 00:35:40,710
If you don't fight,

490
00:35:41,750 --> 00:35:43,120
then it won't hurt.

491
00:35:48,990 --> 00:35:50,640
Your fiancé called.

492
00:36:03,230 --> 00:36:03,710
Besides that,

493
00:36:05,160 --> 00:36:06,190
my name

494
00:36:07,230 --> 00:36:09,270
Feng Xiaosheng.

495
00:36:21,040 --> 00:36:21,880
Halo.

496
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:23,360
Ying Ying,

497
00:36:24,230 --> 00:36:25,270
I'm sorry.

498
00:36:25,470 --> 00:36:26,040
Last night,

499
00:36:26,040 --> 00:36:28,750
I was dragged to drink by the people who welcomed me here.

500
00:36:28,750 --> 00:36:30,750
You know I've only had a few drinks and I'm already drunk.

501
00:36:30,750 --> 00:36:32,510
Didn't call you, don't be angry, okay?

502
00:36:32,800 --> 00:36:34,710
When are you coming back?

503
00:36:35,600 --> 00:36:36,800
At least one week.

504
00:36:37,360 --> 00:36:38,430
Ying Ying, what's wrong with you?

505
00:36:38,800 --> 00:36:39,800
You're okay, right?

506
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,640
I... I'm fine.

507
00:36:47,040 --> 00:36:48,230
Why does it sound

508
00:36:48,430 --> 00:36:49,670
like there's something wrong with you?

509
00:36:50,640 --> 00:36:51,560
Are you at home?

510
00:36:52,430 --> 00:36:53,190
Video calls only.

511
00:36:53,190 --> 00:36:53,950
I'm the one calling.

512
00:37:48,750 --> 00:37:49,400
Actually,

513
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,080
you want to go to jail

514
00:37:52,750 --> 00:37:54,270
to pay your father's debt.

515
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,560
However, after leaving prison,

516
00:37:58,190 --> 00:37:59,270
you found your father

517
00:38:00,120 --> 00:38:01,640
from the start he was oppressed to the point of death

518
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:02,750
by the leeches.

519
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,400
The debt

520
00:38:06,510 --> 00:38:08,910
you still have to keep paying.

521
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:17,270
What do you think this kind of result is

522
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,080
still good?

523
00:38:20,510 --> 00:38:21,560
There's no end to you guys, huh?

524
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,710
I hit that guy!

525
00:38:22,750 --> 00:38:24,040
What more do you want from me?

526
00:38:26,600 --> 00:38:27,600
You want to hit me?

527
00:38:28,040 --> 00:38:28,750
Hit you?

528
00:38:29,750 --> 00:38:31,510
The police won't do that.

529
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,950
However, you will regret it

530
00:38:32,950 --> 00:38:34,950
didn't tell the truth today.

531
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:04,270
Do you know who he is?

532
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:08,160
His name is Chen Jinyan.

533
00:39:09,990 --> 00:39:11,880
The best police.

534
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:17,270
Look at him.

535
00:39:21,750 --> 00:39:24,560
Open your eyes wide, and take a good look!

536
00:39:24,750 --> 00:39:27,040
It was him who was hit and killed! Did you know?

537
00:39:29,990 --> 00:39:31,950
Now you are deliberately obscuring the truth.

538
00:39:32,040 --> 00:39:34,800
That means you're against all police, understand?

539
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,040
The consequence...

540
00:39:49,750 --> 00:39:51,640
you think carefully.

541
00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:04,910
I'll be back in two hours.

542
00:40:04,990 --> 00:40:06,400
I can't believe he didn't confess.

543
00:40:27,880 --> 00:40:28,560
Sit down.

544
00:40:41,270 --> 00:40:43,670
Don't associate with unknown people.

545
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:47,430
Don't forget your identity.

546
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:05,990
There was a policeman named Chen Jinyan.

547
00:41:06,670 --> 00:41:07,470
Do you know?

548
00:41:10,270 --> 00:41:11,160
Familiar.

549
00:41:13,120 --> 00:41:14,230
I told people to do it.

550
00:41:15,190 --> 00:41:16,430
He suspected my identity

551
00:41:16,950 --> 00:41:18,040
and is investigating me.

552
00:41:18,430 --> 00:41:19,910
People you work with,

553
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:21,470
is it reliable?

554
00:41:22,560 --> 00:41:24,950
Humans cannot possibly be completely relied on.

555
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:26,670
However,

556
00:41:27,270 --> 00:41:29,470
He had to risk his life for me.

557
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,750
In that case, this person cannot be allowed to live.

558
00:41:32,600 --> 00:41:35,470
I won't go any further to warn you.

559
00:41:37,190 --> 00:41:38,120
Remember one thing.

560
00:41:39,270 --> 00:41:40,270
Police...

561
00:41:41,270 --> 00:41:42,560
can't be touched anymore.

562
00:41:44,510 --> 00:41:45,160
Good.

563
00:41:53,670 --> 00:41:54,470
Hatred...

564
00:41:55,990 --> 00:41:58,400
will only make your heart narrower.

565
00:41:58,910 --> 00:42:01,190
Must learn to let go slowly.

566
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:06,750
The human eye is in front,

567
00:42:08,230 --> 00:42:12,190
the purpose is so that we continue to look forward.

568
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:13,080
Besides that,

569
00:42:14,230 --> 00:42:16,120
why do you look at company reports?

570
00:42:18,040 --> 00:42:19,750
After all, I'm free and idle,

571
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:21,750
So, I want to learn.

572
00:42:22,510 --> 00:42:23,430
Do you understand?

573
00:42:27,270 --> 00:42:29,710
The company made a lot of money in the last two years, yes.

574
00:42:37,080 --> 00:42:37,750
Mari.

575
00:42:39,190 --> 00:42:40,190
In your free time,

576
00:42:41,120 --> 00:42:42,750
come here often for tea.

577
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:46,880
Tomorrow is still long.

578
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:52,880
Tomorrow is still long.

579
00:43:05,160 --> 00:43:06,710
Several bosses were present, yes.

580
00:43:08,160 --> 00:43:08,950
You Qiang,

581
00:43:09,190 --> 00:43:11,160
quickly get water for Mr. Xu.

582
00:43:11,160 --> 00:43:12,600
It's almost over.

583
00:43:12,910 --> 00:43:13,840
Come on, come on.

584
00:43:14,230 --> 00:43:15,040
That's it, that's it.

585
00:43:15,320 --> 00:43:15,910
Come on, come on.
