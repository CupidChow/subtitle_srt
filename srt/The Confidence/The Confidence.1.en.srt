00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,940
=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 1=

3
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:37,580
(The song "Oh My Beloved Father" is)

4
00:01:37,580 --> 00:01:39,580
(an aria in Gianni Schicchi's opera)

5
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:42,300
(work by Giacomo Puccini.)

6
00:01:42,540 --> 00:01:44,790
(Which contains about a girl begging her father,)

7
00:01:44,860 --> 00:01:45,620
(promise yourself)

8
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,260
(to pursue his love.)

9
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:50,670
(Has a beautiful, emotional, and touching melody.)

10
00:01:50,900 --> 00:01:52,300
(The lyrics are more or less meaningful,)

11
00:01:53,750 --> 00:01:55,390
(My beloved father,)

12
00:01:55,670 --> 00:01:57,540
(I love that young man,)

13
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,790
(I'm willing to go to Porta Rossa,)

14
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:01,540
(to buy a wedding ring.)

15
00:02:02,260 --> 00:02:04,470
(I have to go anyway,)

16
00:02:04,790 --> 00:02:06,260
(if you don't allow it,)

17
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:07,750
(I'm going to Ponte Vecchio,)

18
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,350
(and jumps into the river.)

19
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:12,790
(I'm suffering so much,)

20
00:02:13,310 --> 00:02:14,510
(I'm very sad.)

21
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:18,350
(Oh, God, I'd rather die.)

22
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,230
(Father, I beg you.)

23
00:02:51,380 --> 00:02:53,540
(Again it has arrived in the comfortable afternoon,)

24
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,070
(don't know at the moment)

25
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:56,510
(You who are on the way,)

26
00:02:56,620 --> 00:02:57,620
(most impatient)

27
00:02:57,620 --> 00:02:59,590
(who do you want to meet?)

28
00:03:00,820 --> 00:03:02,310
(With this mood,)

29
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:04,150
(we can feel feelings and love)

30
00:03:04,150 --> 00:03:06,070
(what you want to convey)

31
00:03:06,310 --> 00:03:07,230
(a song.)

32
00:03:08,860 --> 00:03:10,620
(Yuze, video call)

33
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:13,710
(Now, let's enjoy this time)

34
00:03:14,230 --> 00:03:16,180
(quietly.)

35
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:17,180
(surface)

36
00:03:22,590 --> 00:03:23,180
Halo,

37
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,510
Can't video call?

38
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,070
I'm driving.

39
00:03:28,070 --> 00:03:29,150
Just got home from work, very busy.

40
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,180
The location you sent yesterday is correct, right?

41
00:03:31,260 --> 00:03:32,180
There's no wrong point, right?

42
00:03:32,430 --> 00:03:33,620
Exactly, no wrong point.

43
00:03:33,950 --> 00:03:34,870
What do you want?

44
00:03:35,540 --> 00:03:36,990
Don't you want to eat barbecue?

45
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:39,100
Maybe one day I'll be in a good mood,

46
00:03:39,430 --> 00:03:40,020
I will be

47
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:40,990
your personal package sender.

48
00:03:41,180 --> 00:03:41,900
Don't, don't, don't.

49
00:03:42,310 --> 00:03:43,510
You don't come here.

50
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,070
Why?

51
00:03:44,070 --> 00:03:44,950
What do you mean?

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:48,180
Your attitude makes people suspicious.

53
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,790
Of course I very much welcome you,

54
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,430
but I pity you.

55
00:03:52,990 --> 00:03:53,790
It's very far here,

56
00:03:53,790 --> 00:03:54,660
and so many mountain roads,

57
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:55,430
I still want to say...

58
00:03:56,620 --> 00:03:57,150
Halo.

59
00:03:58,460 --> 00:03:58,990
Halo.

60
00:03:59,660 --> 00:04:00,180
Halo.

61
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:02,100
- Hello, Yuze. - Hello.

62
00:04:12,950 --> 00:04:14,870
(Entering the mountain road)

63
00:04:15,430 --> 00:04:17,430
(Please pay attention to driving safety.)

64
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,430
Shocked, right?

65
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:48,340
A little plan.

66
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:49,150
Please!

67
00:05:49,150 --> 00:05:50,190
Is there anyone?

68
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:52,260
Please!

69
00:05:52,470 --> 00:05:53,750
If you dare speak again,

70
00:05:53,870 --> 00:05:54,990
I'll shoot you dead!

71
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,100
I don't talk anymore.

72
00:05:59,060 --> 00:05:59,660
No more talking.

73
00:06:02,590 --> 00:06:03,380
Don't be afraid.

74
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,540
We are not bad people.

75
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:05,310
Don't.

76
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:07,590
Kak Jie.

77
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:10,630
Be a little nimble.

78
00:06:10,630 --> 00:06:11,540
Do not leave problems.

79
00:06:56,220 --> 00:06:57,220
Check there carefully.

80
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:03,630
This car is also looted,

81
00:07:03,780 --> 00:07:04,910
the original owner could not be contacted.

82
00:07:05,150 --> 00:07:05,710
Possibility

83
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:06,470
was killed.

84
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:10,260
This...

85
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:11,380
Drag marks.

86
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,150
Matches the victim's explanation.

87
00:07:30,990 --> 00:07:32,540
This lecturer is really great,

88
00:07:32,540 --> 00:07:34,750
can escape from the trap of three criminals,

89
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,150
not easy

90
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:36,940
Zhong,

91
00:07:37,910 --> 00:07:39,380
from crime scene analysis,

92
00:07:39,470 --> 00:07:41,190
there are at least two suspects who escaped,

93
00:07:41,660 --> 00:07:43,100
and there are wounds on their bodies.

94
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:46,500
Maybe this way.

95
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:48,100
Tell the others,

96
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:50,660
follow this path and keep searching.

97
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:51,910
Good.

98
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:21,540
Hang in there.

99
00:08:37,630 --> 00:08:38,340
Ying Ying,

100
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:40,430
sorry

101
00:08:41,510 --> 00:08:42,190
It's all my fault,

102
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,340
I'm the guilty one.

103
00:08:44,510 --> 00:08:46,510
What is my father and mother

104
00:08:47,100 --> 00:08:48,390
already know?

105
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,270
They don't know,

106
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:53,270
haven't told them yet.

107
00:08:54,270 --> 00:08:56,750
Don't tell them.

108
00:08:57,390 --> 00:08:58,630
They will never know.

109
00:09:22,750 --> 00:09:24,220
There are three criminals,

110
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,990
This can be adjusted to the traces at the crime scene.

111
00:09:27,950 --> 00:09:29,070
He is the burnt one,

112
00:09:29,070 --> 00:09:30,750
stabbed to death by the victim.

113
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:32,310
Then, two more were running away.

114
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:33,580
Both were injured,

115
00:09:33,830 --> 00:09:35,340
and one of them must be seriously injured.

116
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:37,510
These two suspects

117
00:09:37,510 --> 00:09:38,990
it is very possible to sneak back to Nanzhou.

118
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:40,630
So, I guess

119
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,270
the main sweep should be

120
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:44,070
hospitals, clinics and pharmacies.

121
00:09:44,830 --> 00:09:46,220
The suspect burned the car to the ground,

122
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:48,510
meaning their counter-sensing abilities are quite great.

123
00:09:48,750 --> 00:09:50,460
Very likely an escaped fugitive.

124
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,220
The location of the incident is quite remote,

125
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:54,700
and the suspect was injured.

126
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:57,390
So, from this situation,

127
00:09:58,220 --> 00:09:59,580
I think it's a suspect

128
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:00,870
very likely to act again.

129
00:10:00,990 --> 00:10:02,580
They might loot the car.

130
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:04,700
Just got a report,

131
00:10:04,870 --> 00:10:07,270
on the side of the rural road of Xiaojiazhuang,

132
00:10:07,460 --> 00:10:08,510
a goatherd

133
00:10:08,750 --> 00:10:11,340
found a driver who was attacked on the side of the road.

134
00:10:11,870 --> 00:10:13,100
The victim has been sent to hospital,

135
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:14,430
now still unconscious.

136
00:10:15,100 --> 00:10:16,510
Where the victim was found

137
00:10:16,510 --> 00:10:18,750
less than two kilometers from the crime scene you just came to,

138
00:10:18,830 --> 00:10:19,580
still in line.

139
00:10:19,630 --> 00:10:20,510
With your assessment just now,

140
00:10:20,510 --> 00:10:21,750
should be able to connect.

141
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:22,700
Kapten Xiao,

142
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:23,390
Inspector Chen.

143
00:10:24,700 --> 00:10:25,870
The looted car has been found.

144
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:50,630
Local residents said,

145
00:10:50,630 --> 00:10:51,340
when you wake up in the morning

146
00:10:51,340 --> 00:10:52,190
the car is already here,

147
00:10:52,190 --> 00:10:53,430
don't know since when it was here.

148
00:10:56,900 --> 00:10:58,220
I've looked around here,

149
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,510
no CCTV.

150
00:10:59,950 --> 00:11:00,950
Dumped the car here,

151
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:02,070
then, the person entered the alley,

152
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,460
don't know where it will come out.

153
00:11:03,780 --> 00:11:05,430
This shows that he is a suspect

154
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:07,020
very familiar with this area.

155
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:22,300
(Eradicate crime)

156
00:11:27,190 --> 00:11:28,140
Halo.

157
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:29,700
Your order arrives.

158
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:30,310
Okay, thank you.

159
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:31,700
If you like, please give it five stars.

160
00:11:31,700 --> 00:11:32,310
- Good. - Thank You.

161
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:33,460
What?

162
00:11:33,990 --> 00:11:35,510
Have you not paid your debts and are you still hurting?

163
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:37,750
Who?

164
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:40,340
Don't cry.

165
00:11:40,340 --> 00:11:41,220
What are you crying about?

166
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:42,700
You're useless.

167
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:44,390
Wait for me.

168
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:57,190
Oh, right?

169
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,220
Attach one arm again.

170
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:00,270
- What are you doing? - Sis Wu.

171
00:12:00,270 --> 00:12:01,100
Sis Wu.

172
00:12:01,510 --> 00:12:02,460
Sis Wu, I left the dragon one for you.

173
00:12:03,660 --> 00:12:04,190
I tell you,

174
00:12:04,270 --> 00:12:04,750
this is not normal...

175
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:05,390
Don't, don't.

176
00:12:05,630 --> 00:12:06,340
I don't need to.

177
00:12:06,630 --> 00:12:07,950
Just sticking like this is useless.

178
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:08,950
Where is that person?

179
00:12:08,950 --> 00:12:10,070
Give me a look at the location.

180
00:12:10,070 --> 00:12:10,510
Fast.

181
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,220
Location.

182
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:12,510
Look at it.

183
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:14,430
Old complex at the back,

184
00:12:14,430 --> 00:12:15,140
not far.

185
00:12:16,310 --> 00:12:16,830
Oh, right?

186
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,950
Today we get through it.

187
00:12:19,510 --> 00:12:20,510
What did I say before?

188
00:12:21,510 --> 00:12:22,830
What is the most important thing about fighting?

189
00:12:23,830 --> 00:12:25,460
Gaya.

190
00:12:25,700 --> 00:12:26,390
Oh, right?

191
00:12:26,390 --> 00:12:27,140
Gaya.

192
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,310
What?

193
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:30,220
Gaya!

194
00:12:30,430 --> 00:12:31,460
Correct.

195
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:35,180
(Nanzhou Hong'ai Hospital)

196
00:12:39,340 --> 00:12:40,630
Your brain hurts, right?

197
00:12:41,190 --> 00:12:42,310
There's a gun.

198
00:12:43,660 --> 00:12:44,340
Don't.

199
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:45,140
Drag into the forest.

200
00:12:47,310 --> 00:12:48,540
- Brother, don't kill me. - Come on

201
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:49,270
Si... Brother.

202
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,270
Brother, don't kill me.

203
00:12:51,660 --> 00:12:52,310
Sister...

204
00:12:52,310 --> 00:12:53,430
Brother, I beg you.

205
00:12:53,430 --> 00:12:54,750
You want money, a car,

206
00:12:54,750 --> 00:12:55,700
I give it all to you.

207
00:12:55,950 --> 00:12:57,390
I'll transfer right now.

208
00:12:57,390 --> 00:12:58,780
Alipay, WePay, everything is possible.

209
00:12:59,870 --> 00:13:01,020
I... I didn't see you.

210
00:13:01,460 --> 00:13:02,830
I... I won't go to the police.

211
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,430
I... I didn't see you.

212
00:13:04,430 --> 00:13:05,190
Stand!

213
00:13:05,190 --> 00:13:06,660
Please, I'm begging you, Big Brother.

214
00:13:07,140 --> 00:13:08,510
My father and mother are old.

215
00:13:08,510 --> 00:13:08,950
You're...

216
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,540
Nights like this,

217
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:12,540
this kind of tug-of-war is unsightly.

218
00:13:12,540 --> 00:13:13,830
Brother, Brother,

219
00:13:14,020 --> 00:13:15,020
as long as you don't kill me,

220
00:13:15,340 --> 00:13:16,220
I will do anything.

221
00:13:18,310 --> 00:13:19,190
I'll do anything.

222
00:13:19,190 --> 00:13:19,580
Really?

223
00:13:19,580 --> 00:13:20,270
Really.

224
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:24,220
Bos,

225
00:13:24,310 --> 00:13:25,340
I know I'm useless,

226
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:26,310
I'm just an animal.

227
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:27,460
How about like this,

228
00:13:27,580 --> 00:13:28,220
You rest a little,

229
00:13:28,220 --> 00:13:28,830
breathe for a moment.

230
00:13:28,950 --> 00:13:29,540
Give me 10 minutes.

231
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:31,190
No, five minutes is enough.

232
00:13:31,700 --> 00:13:32,630
Hurry up.

233
00:13:32,630 --> 00:13:33,870
Don't delay my business.

234
00:13:34,780 --> 00:13:35,750
The boss is very wise!

235
00:13:38,540 --> 00:13:39,220
Ayo.

236
00:13:40,580 --> 00:13:41,340
That... wait, Sister.

237
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:41,990
What is it?

238
00:13:43,390 --> 00:13:44,430
On rocky ground,

239
00:13:45,340 --> 00:13:46,430
we change places,

240
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:47,870
to my car.

241
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:49,780
Experienced, yes.

242
00:13:49,950 --> 00:13:51,140
Come on, according to your wishes.

243
00:13:51,340 --> 00:13:52,070
Shou Gou.

244
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,340
Turn off the car lights.

245
00:13:57,900 --> 00:13:58,900
Dazzles my eyes.

246
00:14:08,070 --> 00:14:08,780
Ying Ying.

247
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:12,990
It's okay, I'm here.

248
00:14:13,540 --> 00:14:14,430
Surface.

249
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:30,460
How?

250
00:14:30,460 --> 00:14:32,100
At home, playing mahjong.

251
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:33,140
How many people?

252
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:33,780
Four.

253
00:14:34,190 --> 00:14:34,830
Certain?

254
00:14:34,870 --> 00:14:35,510
Certain.

255
00:14:37,830 --> 00:14:38,700
Sis Wu,

256
00:14:38,950 --> 00:14:40,100
just the five of us,

257
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:41,660
not much superior.

258
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:43,140
What a coward.

259
00:14:43,630 --> 00:14:44,830
What matters is the style.

260
00:14:46,540 --> 00:14:47,780
Gaya. Gaya.

261
00:14:47,780 --> 00:14:48,310
Ayo.

262
00:15:12,830 --> 00:15:13,830
- Sis Wu. - Sis Wu.

263
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:15,510
That's okay.

264
00:15:16,990 --> 00:15:17,830
Gaya.

265
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:20,190
Who?

266
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:20,990
Delivery order.

267
00:15:25,830 --> 00:15:26,390
Don't move!

268
00:15:26,390 --> 00:15:27,020
Everyone don't move!

269
00:15:27,020 --> 00:15:28,070
Everyone don't move!

270
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:29,510
Don't move!

271
00:15:31,540 --> 00:15:32,390
Don't move!

272
00:15:33,220 --> 00:15:34,990
Today I'm just looking for Wang Yong.

273
00:15:41,950 --> 00:15:42,950
Everything's pretty calm, yeah.

274
00:15:45,870 --> 00:15:46,540
Which one?

275
00:15:46,750 --> 00:15:47,780
Yes.

276
00:15:50,020 --> 00:15:51,390
Great too, yes.

277
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:56,100
You're the one who hurt my best friend's face, right?

278
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,580
Two thousand yuan alone is not paid,

279
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,070
but you can still play mahjong here.

280
00:16:01,270 --> 00:16:02,190
Aren't you embarrassed?

281
00:16:02,750 --> 00:16:03,990
What do you see?

282
00:16:03,990 --> 00:16:04,510
What is it?

283
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:13,510
Sis.

284
00:16:14,990 --> 00:16:16,780
Isn't it just four people?

285
00:16:16,780 --> 00:16:18,190
I also do not know.

286
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:23,310
Just joking with you.

287
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:24,900
You're really useless.

288
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,540
You just keep pushing for 2000 yuan.

289
00:16:26,540 --> 00:16:27,750
I will apologize to Brother Yong.

290
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:29,510
Maf, Kak Yang.

291
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:30,950
Just die!

292
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,100
Sis Wu.

293
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:32,900
Who are you?

294
00:16:33,340 --> 00:16:34,100
I...

295
00:16:36,540 --> 00:16:37,190
Sis Wu.

296
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,310
- I am your boss! - Do not move!

297
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:39,700
- Don't move! - Don't move!

298
00:16:39,700 --> 00:16:40,310
Don't move everyone!

299
00:16:40,310 --> 00:16:40,750
Do not come close!

300
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:42,100
- Don't move! - Don't move!

301
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:43,780
The thing in my hand has no eyes,

302
00:16:43,780 --> 00:16:45,220
don't hurt him.

303
00:16:56,270 --> 00:16:57,660
Only holding four two number cards,

304
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:59,660
you're useless too.

305
00:17:12,300 --> 00:17:13,030
Go for it.

306
00:17:14,300 --> 00:17:15,060
You...

307
00:17:15,060 --> 00:17:16,390
don't go, keep going.

308
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,030
I have many people here.

309
00:17:18,270 --> 00:17:19,550
One or two people die,

310
00:17:19,550 --> 00:17:20,750
no problem either.

311
00:17:29,700 --> 00:17:30,700
"Little chicken".

312
00:17:32,550 --> 00:17:34,940
I will kill you!

313
00:17:44,060 --> 00:17:45,060
Kak Qiang!

314
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:45,940
Police!

315
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:47,870
Brother Qiang, go quickly.

316
00:17:47,870 --> 00:17:48,630
Fast!

317
00:17:48,630 --> 00:17:49,390
Hua Zi!

318
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:50,790
- Hurry up! - Sister!

319
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:51,750
Bald,

320
00:17:51,750 --> 00:17:52,270
this side

321
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:56,390
Do not move! Police!

322
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,390
Fast!

323
00:17:57,390 --> 00:17:58,030
Kak Qiang.

324
00:17:58,220 --> 00:17:58,750
Ayo!

325
00:18:10,870 --> 00:18:11,790
- Sis Qiang! - Don't run!

326
00:18:18,910 --> 00:18:19,630
Wrong direction!

327
00:18:20,460 --> 00:18:21,870
Why follow us?

328
00:18:21,870 --> 00:18:22,870
Run away. Sis, run!

329
00:18:22,870 --> 00:18:23,990
Don't move!

330
00:18:25,030 --> 00:18:26,420
Stop! Don't run!

331
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:33,670
What are you doing?

332
00:18:33,670 --> 00:18:34,150
Hurry let us in,

333
00:18:34,150 --> 00:18:35,030
or don't hope you can go.

334
00:18:35,030 --> 00:18:36,030
The police are coming!

335
00:18:36,630 --> 00:18:37,910
Don't be slow!

336
00:18:41,750 --> 00:18:42,420
Stop!

337
00:18:42,420 --> 00:18:42,750
Open!

338
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:57,220
Fast!

339
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,300
Run quickly, Pi Ku!

340
00:18:59,420 --> 00:19:00,060
Go quickly, go.

341
00:19:00,060 --> 00:19:01,180
- Bald, quick!

342
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,300
You cheaters,

343
00:19:02,300 --> 00:19:03,700
why keep following us?

344
00:19:05,390 --> 00:19:06,510
Where is Hua Zi?

345
00:19:06,870 --> 00:19:08,300
Just look at his luck.

346
00:19:11,550 --> 00:19:13,870
Brother, what's your name?

347
00:19:14,030 --> 00:19:15,060
He is my boss,

348
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,030
Kak Qiang.

349
00:19:20,670 --> 00:19:21,700
Kak Qiang?

350
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:23,870
Today I owe it to Brother Qiang,

351
00:19:23,870 --> 00:19:25,550
my gratitude is beyond words.

352
00:19:25,550 --> 00:19:27,150
Someday if you need me,

353
00:19:27,150 --> 00:19:27,790
You just say it.

354
00:19:28,060 --> 00:19:28,940
As the saying goes,

355
00:19:28,940 --> 00:19:30,150
as long as the mountains are not green...

356
00:19:30,150 --> 00:19:30,790
Salah.

357
00:19:30,790 --> 00:19:32,870
As long as the mountains are green, so long will our friendship be.

358
00:19:32,870 --> 00:19:34,180
Brother Qiang, my name is Wu.

359
00:19:49,750 --> 00:19:50,750
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

360
00:19:50,750 --> 00:19:51,300
Nona,

361
00:19:51,300 --> 00:19:52,910
slow... slow a little.

362
00:19:53,510 --> 00:19:54,420
Nona,

363
00:19:54,910 --> 00:19:55,870
Usually this is my situation

364
00:19:55,870 --> 00:19:57,790
will not leave a trace,

365
00:19:57,790 --> 00:19:58,550
yes, right?

366
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,670
It's very difficult to look as handsome as me,

367
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:02,150
If there are any marks it would be a shame.

368
00:20:02,150 --> 00:20:03,060
Oh, right?

369
00:20:04,270 --> 00:20:05,220
Nona.

370
00:20:05,550 --> 00:20:07,060
What are you doing?

371
00:20:07,870 --> 00:20:09,510
I've been having a hard time sticking it, but you...

372
00:20:09,510 --> 00:20:10,630
Can talk nice, can't you?

373
00:20:11,060 --> 00:20:13,060
Everything is erased.

374
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:13,990
Here, let me help you move it.

375
00:20:13,990 --> 00:20:14,510
Here.

376
00:20:16,270 --> 00:20:17,150
It really hurts, doesn't it?

377
00:20:17,150 --> 00:20:18,300
That's right.

378
00:20:18,990 --> 00:20:19,700
Miss, don't take it to heart, yes.

379
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:20,460
This friend of mine

380
00:20:20,460 --> 00:20:21,550
pampered from childhood.

381
00:20:21,670 --> 00:20:22,300
We are invisible

382
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:22,790
like a bad guy,

383
00:20:22,790 --> 00:20:23,550
yes, right?

384
00:20:25,790 --> 00:20:26,550
Don't move.

385
00:20:26,910 --> 00:20:27,790
Police.

386
00:20:49,270 --> 00:20:50,150
Ayo.

387
00:21:23,550 --> 00:21:25,030
You really think it's your first night, huh?

388
00:21:30,060 --> 00:21:31,180
Kak Jie!

389
00:21:54,580 --> 00:21:55,500
(surface)

390
00:21:57,820 --> 00:21:58,540
(surface)

391
00:21:59,630 --> 00:22:00,820
Hello, Ying Ying, I just heard...

392
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,790
face

393
00:22:01,790 --> 00:22:03,460
I'm on my way to your place.

394
00:22:04,340 --> 00:22:05,180
I met a criminal.

395
00:22:05,220 --> 00:22:06,630
I sent you my location.

396
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,300
Please come in.

397
00:22:37,910 --> 00:22:38,510
Mr. Yang

398
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:39,390
Officer Xing.

399
00:22:39,750 --> 00:22:41,670
He is a sketch artist.

400
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:43,060
Halo.

401
00:22:43,870 --> 00:22:45,150
We need Miss Ke

402
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:46,820
cooperate with us.

403
00:22:48,630 --> 00:22:50,100
However, Ying Ying now might...

404
00:22:50,100 --> 00:22:51,300
I can.

405
00:22:54,390 --> 00:22:55,390
It doesn't matter.

406
00:23:07,150 --> 00:23:08,340
The suspect was reported to the hospital

407
00:23:08,340 --> 00:23:09,420
are both of them.

408
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,150
One had a head injury,

409
00:23:12,300 --> 00:23:14,100
the other had a scratch on his arm.

410
00:23:14,820 --> 00:23:15,910
Just a scratch?

411
00:23:15,910 --> 00:23:16,940
Just a scratch.

412
00:23:20,510 --> 00:23:21,150
Mr Officer,

413
00:23:21,150 --> 00:23:22,420
I'm completely innocent.

414
00:23:22,750 --> 00:23:24,220
I don't gamble.

415
00:23:25,030 --> 00:23:26,030
Me and my friends

416
00:23:26,030 --> 00:23:27,220
go there to find Wang Yong.

417
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,790
He owed my friend 2000 yuan.

418
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:29,340
Who knows

419
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:30,820
at home gambling.

420
00:23:30,990 --> 00:23:31,990
Not asking you that.

421
00:23:32,270 --> 00:23:33,180
So what?

422
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:34,990
Tell me what happened last night.

423
00:23:35,150 --> 00:23:36,100
Last night?

424
00:23:36,270 --> 00:23:37,100
About what?

425
00:23:38,100 --> 00:23:39,340
Last night?

426
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:40,630
Apart from delivering orders,

427
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,670
I just sleep.

428
00:23:41,870 --> 00:23:42,580
Mr Officer.

429
00:23:42,580 --> 00:23:43,510
Listen to me.

430
00:23:44,100 --> 00:23:45,550
Don't look at me like this,

431
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,150
I'm really not a bad person.

432
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,580
I'm just a food delivery person.

433
00:23:48,820 --> 00:23:51,550
This tattoo on my arm is... fake.

434
00:23:53,630 --> 00:23:54,750
Looking around.

435
00:23:56,750 --> 00:23:57,630
- Everything is fake. - Nope.

436
00:23:57,630 --> 00:23:59,750
To scare people.

437
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,820
I'm really a food delivery person.

438
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:04,750
I've worked for two years.

439
00:24:05,670 --> 00:24:07,030
Halo, Xing Wei.

440
00:24:07,220 --> 00:24:07,910
Inspector Chen.

441
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:09,180
The sketch of the suspect's face has been completed.

442
00:24:09,180 --> 00:24:10,150
I'll send it to you.

443
00:24:10,390 --> 00:24:11,580
OK, let me see.

444
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,870
Why is his face so familiar?

445
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:20,940
Shen Shijie.

446
00:24:23,870 --> 00:24:24,870
Really he is.

447
00:24:24,870 --> 00:24:25,750
My hands slowly...

448
00:24:30,790 --> 00:24:31,420
Already.

449
00:24:32,060 --> 00:24:32,940
Go home.

450
00:24:33,220 --> 00:24:34,270
Work well.

451
00:24:34,630 --> 00:24:35,460
Don't make any more trouble.

452
00:24:35,460 --> 00:24:36,700
Of course, just relax.

453
00:24:37,180 --> 00:24:38,270
Thank you, Sis... No,

454
00:24:38,580 --> 00:24:41,270
Thank you, Mr. Police, for helping restore our reputation.

455
00:24:41,510 --> 00:24:42,220
No need, no need.

456
00:24:42,870 --> 00:24:43,750
Go away.

457
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:44,510
Sis.

458
00:24:47,100 --> 00:24:49,220
Thank you, thank you, Mr. Police.

459
00:24:49,910 --> 00:24:50,790
Thank You.

460
00:24:51,100 --> 00:24:52,270
Sis Wu is never nervous.

461
00:24:56,870 --> 00:24:57,870
Ke Ying.

462
00:24:58,220 --> 00:24:59,550
We still have to bother you.

463
00:25:00,060 --> 00:25:01,390
Does that person exist

464
00:25:01,550 --> 00:25:02,510
among these photos?

465
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,220
In... him.

466
00:25:26,340 --> 00:25:27,270
He called her...

467
00:25:27,910 --> 00:25:28,630
Kak Jie.

468
00:25:29,270 --> 00:25:30,030
Kak Jie.

469
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:31,670
Kak... Kak Jie.

470
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:35,340
Inspector.

471
00:25:35,750 --> 00:25:37,510
The fingerprint identification results on the car have come out.

472
00:25:37,510 --> 00:25:39,220
Milik Lao Hu yang kabur bersama Shen Shijie.

473
00:25:39,510 --> 00:25:41,630
Previously, he was sentenced to five years for intentional assault.

474
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:42,790
So, there is a criminal record.

475
00:25:43,580 --> 00:25:44,870
The photo has identified the victim.

476
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:45,990
He is the person.

477
00:25:49,510 --> 00:25:51,700
From the victim's identification, he was Shen Shijie.

478
00:25:52,030 --> 00:25:53,100
Nicknamed Sis Jie.

479
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,270
In cases 1-28,

480
00:25:54,270 --> 00:25:57,060
he was wanted for killing Ma Bin, chairman of the Gongcheng Group.

481
00:25:57,420 --> 00:25:59,060
Then, fled from Nanzhou with his two colleagues.

482
00:25:59,670 --> 00:26:00,790
On the evening of March 14,

483
00:26:01,390 --> 00:26:03,340
His attempt to rob Ke Ying was met with resistance.

484
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,940
One of his colleagues was injured and the other was killed.

485
00:26:06,030 --> 00:26:07,100
This one is named Wu Yajun.

486
00:26:07,460 --> 00:26:08,390
I'm Going To Hu.

487
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:10,630
He has always been Shen Shijie's right-hand man.

488
00:26:11,510 --> 00:26:12,910
This one is nicknamed Shou Gou.

489
00:26:13,270 --> 00:26:14,700
His friend was killed.

490
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,390
This is the vehicle the perpetrator left behind,

491
00:26:18,390 --> 00:26:19,700
and we found it yesterday morning.

492
00:26:20,630 --> 00:26:22,390
Based on these clues, we can conclude that

493
00:26:22,630 --> 00:26:23,630
Shen Shijie and co

494
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:24,870
had sneaked back to Nanzhou.

495
00:26:24,870 --> 00:26:27,460
I suggest using the location where the car was left as a reference,

496
00:26:27,460 --> 00:26:29,820
and do a thorough search of the surrounding area.

497
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,460
Then,

498
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:33,990
ketetndang bendah nyuu into the body,

499
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:35,750
then, pulled Sis Wu into the car.

500
00:26:35,750 --> 00:26:37,550
The bedebah waved the knife,

501
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,990
thrust it at me.

502
00:26:40,420 --> 00:26:41,100
I...

503
00:26:41,340 --> 00:26:42,220
- Continue. - I...

504
00:26:42,340 --> 00:26:43,460
Un... luckily,

505
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:45,300
Sis Wu responded quickly.

506
00:26:46,340 --> 00:26:47,550
He reflexively grabbed me

507
00:26:47,550 --> 00:26:48,870
to the side.

508
00:26:50,060 --> 00:26:52,100
Can I let Sister Wu hold the knife for me?

509
00:26:52,420 --> 00:26:53,300
Certainly not.

510
00:26:53,550 --> 00:26:54,420
Therefore,

511
00:26:55,390 --> 00:26:56,990
I immediately raised my hand

512
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,580
bravely and hold it.

513
00:27:02,100 --> 00:27:04,340
Then, a knife plunged into my arm.

514
00:27:04,990 --> 00:27:06,030
Translucent.

515
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:09,420
Fortunately there is him.

516
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:11,390
I don't even know where I am today,

517
00:27:11,390 --> 00:27:12,460
if he wasn't there.

518
00:27:13,630 --> 00:27:14,300
Come on, come on.

519
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,030
I go to the toilet.

520
00:27:15,270 --> 00:27:16,300
Sis Wu can't stand hearing you anymore.

521
00:27:16,300 --> 00:27:17,340
I've been practicing.

522
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,820
I...

523
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:18,550
Stupid.

524
00:27:18,550 --> 00:27:19,420
...didn't even blink.

525
00:27:19,420 --> 00:27:20,220
Come on, come on.

526
00:27:20,990 --> 00:27:22,150
If you have time, practice a lot.

527
00:27:22,150 --> 00:27:22,750
understand?

528
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:36,300
I thought the police were following you there.

529
00:27:36,300 --> 00:27:37,270
No, Brother Qiang, we...

530
00:27:37,270 --> 00:27:39,420
I... lost a member,

531
00:27:39,420 --> 00:27:41,420
money was also confiscated by the police.

532
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,390
Do you know how much of my money the police confiscated?

533
00:27:54,300 --> 00:27:55,180
You're being asked.

534
00:27:55,180 --> 00:27:56,340
Answer.

535
00:27:58,180 --> 00:28:00,910
Be... how much money

536
00:28:00,910 --> 00:28:01,750
confiscated?

537
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,460
Three...

538
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:19,270
million.

539
00:28:28,820 --> 00:28:30,820
I asked for this money from you, no problem, right?

540
00:28:32,100 --> 00:28:32,870
Kak Qiang,

541
00:28:33,870 --> 00:28:35,060
I really don't have any money.

542
00:28:35,390 --> 00:28:36,940
Return the money or cut off your hands,

543
00:28:36,940 --> 00:28:37,750
select one.

544
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:38,390
Sis,

545
00:28:38,390 --> 00:28:41,150
I'm just a food delivery person, really don't have three million.

546
00:28:41,510 --> 00:28:42,060
Cut!

547
00:28:42,550 --> 00:28:43,390
Don't!

548
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:45,030
Sis.

549
00:28:45,030 --> 00:28:46,030
There's no point in cutting it,

550
00:28:46,030 --> 00:28:47,670
my hands are not that valuable.

551
00:28:48,340 --> 00:28:49,340
That is true.

552
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,060
Kak Qiang.

553
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,510
As for money, I don't have it,

554
00:28:54,550 --> 00:28:56,460
there is only this worthless life...

555
00:28:57,220 --> 00:28:57,820
Later,

556
00:28:57,820 --> 00:28:58,910
when you need me,

557
00:28:58,910 --> 00:28:59,910
just say it.

558
00:29:00,790 --> 00:29:02,420
No matter how hard it is,

559
00:29:02,700 --> 00:29:04,420
I'll definitely finish it for you.

560
00:29:04,550 --> 00:29:06,510
I'll do whatever you ask.

561
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:08,180
You'll do whatever I ask?

562
00:29:08,180 --> 00:29:08,790
Correct.

563
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:12,030
Sign the sales contract.

564
00:29:14,820 --> 00:29:15,790
To prostitute oneself?

565
00:29:17,270 --> 00:29:18,870
Play dumb, okay?

566
00:29:19,030 --> 00:29:20,910
Brother Qiang considers you a member.

567
00:29:21,910 --> 00:29:22,910
Still don't understand?

568
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:25,390
Starting today, work for me well.

569
00:29:25,390 --> 00:29:27,460
All your salary to pay off debt.

570
00:29:27,460 --> 00:29:28,940
Get three meals a day and accommodation.

571
00:29:28,940 --> 00:29:30,580
The bonus depends on your performance that month.

572
00:29:39,340 --> 00:29:40,220
Th... thank you, Sis Qiang.

573
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:41,990
Succeed.

574
00:29:41,990 --> 00:29:42,700
Thank you, Sis Qiang.

575
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:46,460
Has he contacted you?

576
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,460
So?

577
00:29:49,420 --> 00:29:50,300
Who?

578
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,630
Shen Shijie.

579
00:29:55,390 --> 00:29:56,270
Like Jie, ya?

580
00:29:57,750 --> 00:29:58,460
You also know

581
00:29:58,460 --> 00:30:00,150
I'm not familiar with Sis Jie.

582
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:06,300
(Kantor)

583
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,270
(Shen Shijie, laki-laki,)

584
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:09,700
(born in 1988 in Nanzhou City, Haichuan Province.)

585
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:11,870
(Height is about 187 cm, face shape is square.)

586
00:30:11,990 --> 00:30:13,060
Sir, what medicine do you need?

587
00:30:13,420 --> 00:30:14,390
Injured on left palm.

588
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:16,870
(According to the results of the police crime scene investigation,)

589
00:30:16,870 --> 00:30:19,300
(the suspect most likely fled to Nanzhou City.)

590
00:30:19,670 --> 00:30:22,060
(Hopefully the whole community will take the initiative to provide guidance.)

591
00:30:29,100 --> 00:30:30,940
Sorry to bother you guys,

592
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,180
Have you ever seen this person?

593
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:33,390
Like this.

594
00:30:33,790 --> 00:30:34,670
Never.

595
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:40,790
Already bleeding that much,

596
00:30:40,790 --> 00:30:41,910
If you don't die, you will also be disabled.

597
00:30:42,580 --> 00:30:44,510
Even though he came here to dump the car on purpose.

598
00:30:44,940 --> 00:30:46,150
He shouldn't be able to run far.

599
00:30:55,400 --> 00:30:57,100
(This is Shen Shijie's hiding place)

600
00:30:57,150 --> 00:30:57,870
Zhong.

601
00:30:58,390 --> 00:30:59,510
Check this place out.

602
00:31:00,340 --> 00:31:01,300
Likewise with the person who sent the message.

603
00:31:01,990 --> 00:31:02,630
Good.

604
00:32:02,030 --> 00:32:02,670
Kak Jie.

605
00:32:02,990 --> 00:32:04,220
We can't continue here.

606
00:32:04,390 --> 00:32:05,460
We have to find a way.

607
00:32:05,630 --> 00:32:07,340
Ask Dao Jian to think of a way to help us.

608
00:32:12,060 --> 00:32:12,670
Kak Jie.

609
00:32:12,790 --> 00:32:13,870
Dao Jian is not a bad person,

610
00:32:14,030 --> 00:32:15,700
he often praises you behind your back.

611
00:32:27,390 --> 00:32:28,100
What is it?

612
00:32:38,700 --> 00:32:39,670
Police.

613
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,630
Dao Jian really betrayed us?

614
00:32:43,670 --> 00:32:45,180
Turns out he stabbed us in the back.

615
00:32:48,750 --> 00:32:49,390
Kak Jie.

616
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:50,300
Go away.

617
00:32:50,750 --> 00:32:51,460
Don't mind me.

618
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,100
You can't run away with me.

619
00:32:53,100 --> 00:32:54,300
Go quickly, Brother Jie!

620
00:32:54,390 --> 00:32:55,270
Look for Kun.

621
00:32:55,270 --> 00:32:56,460
Find a way to escape!

622
00:33:07,990 --> 00:33:08,700
Kak Jie.

623
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,030
Having a friend like you,

624
00:33:11,270 --> 00:33:11,990
already matched.

625
00:33:12,270 --> 00:33:13,030
Stay cool.

626
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:15,100
I won't say anything.

627
00:34:04,670 --> 00:34:05,220
You stay here.

628
00:34:05,220 --> 00:34:05,870
You come with me.

629
00:34:15,140 --> 00:34:15,790
Stop.

630
00:35:01,620 --> 00:35:02,420
In this place,

631
00:35:02,590 --> 00:35:04,140
there is an old hall of the machine factory.

632
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:06,140
It's been neglected for a long time.

633
00:35:06,140 --> 00:35:06,990
Mayat Wu Yajun

634
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:08,070
found here.

635
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:09,860
At the same time, a cellphone was also found.

636
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:11,830
Zhong had already gone to get the inspection report.

637
00:35:12,550 --> 00:35:13,140
Kapten Xiao.

638
00:35:16,620 --> 00:35:17,620
Forensic report.

639
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:18,550
Phone test report.

640
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,460
Wu Yajun's death was caused by a sharp object with a diameter of three millimeters

641
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:24,750
and three centimeters long pierced the blood vessels in his neck.

642
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:25,750
Died due to excessive blood loss.

643
00:35:25,750 --> 00:35:27,830
The data on the cellphone has also been extracted.

644
00:35:27,830 --> 00:35:30,140
The final call was made to Zhang Zhigao, nicknamed Dao Jian,

645
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,620
namely the general manager of Jujinxiao.

646
00:35:31,620 --> 00:35:32,590
Previously,

647
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,700
sama seperti Shen Shijie,

648
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:34,990
they were Feng Meng's subordinates.

649
00:35:35,380 --> 00:35:36,750
Bring him here immediately.

650
00:35:36,750 --> 00:35:37,460
Good.

651
00:35:39,460 --> 00:35:41,140
Did Wu Yajun call you?

652
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,140
Who?

653
00:35:43,070 --> 00:35:44,350
Wu Yajun?

654
00:35:44,350 --> 00:35:45,030
Correct.

655
00:35:46,070 --> 00:35:46,860
Do not know her.

656
00:35:46,900 --> 00:35:47,830
Wu Yajun,

657
00:35:47,990 --> 00:35:48,990
Si Lao Hu.

658
00:35:49,830 --> 00:35:50,790
But Is, and?

659
00:35:50,830 --> 00:35:51,750
I know that.

660
00:35:52,420 --> 00:35:53,140
What's wrong with him?

661
00:35:53,140 --> 00:35:54,750
Stop pretending here.

662
00:35:56,110 --> 00:35:57,310
Did he call you?

663
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:59,310
There really is.

664
00:35:59,380 --> 00:36:01,110
After all, we used to be friends.

665
00:36:01,270 --> 00:36:02,620
When he called me,

666
00:36:02,990 --> 00:36:06,030
I want to just leave it or turn it off,

667
00:36:06,110 --> 00:36:07,270
everything is inappropriate.

668
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,140
What are you talking about?

669
00:36:10,380 --> 00:36:12,420
He probably committed a crime, and needs money to escape,

670
00:36:12,420 --> 00:36:13,310
but don't worry.

671
00:36:13,420 --> 00:36:14,270
I didn't lend it.

672
00:36:14,750 --> 00:36:15,940
I am an honest businessman.

673
00:36:15,990 --> 00:36:18,030
Can't participate in the act of protecting criminals.

674
00:36:18,110 --> 00:36:18,860
Moreover,

675
00:36:18,900 --> 00:36:19,620
on the phone,

676
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,110
I very seriously advise him.

677
00:36:21,310 --> 00:36:22,510
Must surrender.

678
00:36:22,590 --> 00:36:24,550
Completely repent and start over.

679
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:26,420
Can't be an enemy of society.

680
00:36:26,940 --> 00:36:27,790
So,

681
00:36:28,270 --> 00:36:29,140
what did he say?

682
00:36:34,830 --> 00:36:35,620
Old Veteran.

683
00:36:36,110 --> 00:36:36,620
Of.

684
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,270
It is said that this Dao Jian,

685
00:36:38,270 --> 00:36:39,700
menggantikan posisi Shen Shijie.

686
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,110
Much appreciated by Feng Meng.

687
00:36:41,550 --> 00:36:43,140
Feng Meng will definitely come to make up for it.

688
00:36:45,380 --> 00:36:46,380
Captain Xiao, Inspector Chen.

689
00:36:46,790 --> 00:36:47,590
Internet cafe CCTV.

690
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,860
He covered himself without any gaps.

691
00:36:51,030 --> 00:36:52,860
Can find out where Shen Shijie is hiding,

692
00:36:52,860 --> 00:36:54,460
must be the person on Feng Meng's side.

693
00:36:55,030 --> 00:36:55,860
I went to look for Feng Meng.

694
00:37:01,030 --> 00:37:02,460
Over the years of operation,

695
00:37:03,030 --> 00:37:05,460
The Feng Group adheres to the most basic values,

696
00:37:05,660 --> 00:37:07,180
resist the temptation of profit.

697
00:37:07,180 --> 00:37:10,940
Insist on getting fair reply from the market with professional ability.

698
00:37:11,590 --> 00:37:13,700
Paying attention to the environment and giving back to society,

699
00:37:13,990 --> 00:37:17,220
is the cornerstone of the Feng Group's success.

700
00:37:18,790 --> 00:37:19,990
Thanks again to the guests.

701
00:37:20,460 --> 00:37:20,990
Furthermore,

702
00:37:20,990 --> 00:37:22,750
finally arrived at the most important event.

703
00:37:23,460 --> 00:37:24,990
Next, let's welcome

704
00:37:25,140 --> 00:37:28,460
the person who always brings us to step forward in the field of new energy,

705
00:37:28,860 --> 00:37:30,460
Ketua Direksi, Feng Xiaosheng.

706
00:37:41,750 --> 00:37:43,070
I had a dream before,

707
00:37:46,420 --> 00:37:47,620
I dream of the future,

708
00:37:48,110 --> 00:37:49,830
artificial intelligence can bring

709
00:37:49,830 --> 00:37:51,070
more convenience for our lives.

710
00:37:51,790 --> 00:37:53,110
Materials are no longer scarce.

711
00:37:54,030 --> 00:37:55,030
There is no war.

712
00:37:55,790 --> 00:37:56,790
No disease.

713
00:37:57,270 --> 00:37:58,620
Humans are united.

714
00:38:00,140 --> 00:38:02,620
Regardless of race, color, country,

715
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:04,140
also does not differentiate between gender and age.

716
00:38:04,790 --> 00:38:06,900
That is a very, very beautiful picture.

717
00:38:08,140 --> 00:38:09,070
I want to share

718
00:38:09,070 --> 00:38:10,270
a video with you guys.

719
00:38:23,380 --> 00:38:24,140
I'll answer the phone first.

720
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:24,750
Good.

721
00:38:38,270 --> 00:38:39,350
There are reports from the public.

722
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,310
Traces of Shen Shijie have been found.

723
00:38:41,550 --> 00:38:42,140
Ayo.

724
00:38:49,790 --> 00:38:50,990
You've seen...

725
00:38:51,620 --> 00:38:52,380
sun,

726
00:38:53,420 --> 00:38:54,140
wind,

727
00:38:55,750 --> 00:38:56,620
geothermal,

728
00:38:57,350 --> 00:38:58,110
sea,

729
00:38:58,790 --> 00:38:59,790
ebb and flow

730
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,790
Nature bestows humanity

731
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:04,140
conditions for survival and development of everything.

732
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:05,790
However, what about us?

733
00:39:06,750 --> 00:39:08,140
What is our response to nature?

734
00:39:10,110 --> 00:39:11,590
Demanding without knowing satisfaction.

735
00:39:16,420 --> 00:39:17,350
This cave.

736
00:39:17,350 --> 00:39:18,350
By the beach.

737
00:39:18,590 --> 00:39:19,620
Someone is hiding inside.

738
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:21,460
According to residents who have seen the wanted announcement.

739
00:39:21,460 --> 00:39:22,380
Very similar to Shen Shijie.

740
00:39:22,620 --> 00:39:23,860
Ask everyone to be alert.

741
00:39:27,270 --> 00:39:28,110
Please take a look.

742
00:39:44,620 --> 00:39:45,860
Everyone, be alert!

743
00:39:50,620 --> 00:39:51,310
Ayo.

744
00:39:52,590 --> 00:39:53,940
I feel so embarrassed,

745
00:39:55,140 --> 00:39:56,750
but more afraid.

746
00:39:57,550 --> 00:39:59,030
Human greed

747
00:39:59,590 --> 00:40:01,790
is destroying the Earth.

748
00:40:12,350 --> 00:40:14,110
This should not be our future.

749
00:40:14,380 --> 00:40:16,110
We have to change.

750
00:40:23,940 --> 00:40:25,140
Just by changing,

751
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,140
we just have a future.

752
00:40:27,620 --> 00:40:30,350
Inspector Chen, the suspect found behind the mountain, ran south.

753
00:40:30,590 --> 00:40:31,070
Kak Dong,

754
00:40:31,070 --> 00:40:31,620
check the crime scene.

755
00:40:31,900 --> 00:40:32,350
Good.

756
00:40:34,900 --> 00:40:35,550
Stop!

757
00:40:50,030 --> 00:40:50,900
Furthermore,

758
00:40:51,990 --> 00:40:53,750
I want to share with you...

759
00:41:01,380 --> 00:41:04,270
vehicle hybrid GRV,

760
00:41:04,420 --> 00:41:06,790
which is our future.

761
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:45,420
Zhong.

762
00:41:45,620 --> 00:41:46,830
Take some people down with you.

763
00:41:47,310 --> 00:41:48,030
Team one comes with me.

764
00:41:48,030 --> 00:41:48,620
Good.

765
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,550
He's dead.

766
00:41:58,070 --> 00:41:59,270
Falling off a cliff.

767
00:41:59,860 --> 00:42:02,140
Although the corpse was not intact and the face could not be recognized.

768
00:42:02,590 --> 00:42:05,790
However, we have compared the corpse with

769
00:42:05,790 --> 00:42:07,350
fingerprints and bloodstains found in the cave.

770
00:42:08,140 --> 00:42:08,940
DNA comparison

771
00:42:08,940 --> 00:42:09,750
has also come out.

772
00:42:10,140 --> 00:42:11,590
Everything is guaranteed to be identical.

773
00:42:13,750 --> 00:42:15,990
He... is really dead?

774
00:42:16,070 --> 00:42:16,900
Correct.

775
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:19,110
DNA

776
00:42:19,460 --> 00:42:20,420
won't cheat.

777
00:42:21,510 --> 00:42:23,030
So, you have to get well soon.

778
00:42:45,550 --> 00:42:47,550
(Seven months later)

779
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:49,550
(Next, a quick info.)

780
00:42:49,750 --> 00:42:50,620
(This afternoon,)

781
00:42:50,620 --> 00:42:52,550
(Feng-Fuyong Holding Company donation ceremony)

782
00:42:52,550 --> 00:42:55,860
(to help educational development)

783
00:42:55,860 --> 00:42:57,510
(and groundbreaking ceremony)

784
00:42:57,510 --> 00:42:58,620
(contribution to the construction of Zhenzhi Building,)

785
00:42:58,620 --> 00:43:00,310
(new energy research institute of Nanzhou University,)

786
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:01,860
(will be held at Nanzhou University.)

787
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,940
I've seen the material.

788
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,620
There are indeed many problems.

789
00:43:05,070 --> 00:43:06,790
However, I couldn't explain it on the phone.

790
00:43:08,620 --> 00:43:09,940
Wait for you to come home. We'll discuss it when we meet.

791
00:43:09,940 --> 00:43:10,620
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

792
00:43:10,620 --> 00:43:11,310
Morning, ma'am.

793
00:43:12,140 --> 00:43:12,940
I understand.

794
00:43:15,620 --> 00:43:16,590
Sorry, Mrs. Ke.

795
00:43:16,900 --> 00:43:17,620
It doesn't matter.

796
00:43:19,380 --> 00:43:20,030
It doesn't matter.

797
00:43:20,030 --> 00:43:21,510
There was a student who almost hit me.

798
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:23,990
There are people donating money to the campus to build buildings,

799
00:43:23,990 --> 00:43:25,590
today all the leaders came.

800
00:43:27,380 --> 00:43:28,070
Stop it.

801
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:28,990
I'll close first, okay?

802
00:43:29,270 --> 00:43:30,380
My cellphone got hot.

803
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:32,310
Take care of yourself.

804
00:43:34,310 --> 00:43:35,070
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

805
00:43:35,350 --> 00:43:35,940
Halo.

806
00:43:36,550 --> 00:43:37,070
Good.

807
00:43:37,310 --> 00:43:38,380
Just send it to my cell phone.

808
00:43:50,860 --> 00:43:51,420
Excuse me,

809
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:53,350
How do I get to the dean's office?

810
00:43:54,380 --> 00:43:55,380
Over there is the third floor.
