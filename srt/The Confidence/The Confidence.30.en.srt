3
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:00,060
Oh, yes, Gang,

4
00:02:00,580 --> 00:02:01,900
My treatment will take a very long time.

5
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:03,740
How about you go find a place to rest for a while?

6
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:04,620
Just pick me up later.

7
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:06,100
It's okay, Miss Ke.

8
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:07,220
I'll wait for you in the car.

9
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,540
You're...

10
00:02:52,420 --> 00:02:53,820
You'll help me, won't you, Miss?

11
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:56,540
Come, come, come.

12
00:02:57,940 --> 00:02:59,420
Take all this, take it.

13
00:02:59,900 --> 00:03:01,220
I want to go on a date.

14
00:03:01,220 --> 00:03:02,300
I will be right back.

15
00:03:02,420 --> 00:03:03,500
Yes? Thank You.

16
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,180
Thank you.

17
00:03:27,860 --> 00:03:28,940
(Mr. Feng)

18
00:03:31,740 --> 00:03:32,540
Mr. Feng.

19
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:33,620
Gang.

20
00:03:33,820 --> 00:03:35,740
Help me see whether Ke Ying is still inside or not.

21
00:04:04,740 --> 00:04:05,540
Ying Ying.

00:04:06,020 --> 00:04:06,860
Surface.

23
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:09,420
As I told you on the phone yesterday,

24
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:11,100
business this time

25
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,980
it might be very dangerous.

26
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,300
Are you sure you're ready?

27
00:04:17,050 --> 00:04:17,860
Ying Ying.

28
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:19,620
Whatever happens,

29
00:04:20,290 --> 00:04:21,740
I will still stand by your side.

30
00:04:26,660 --> 00:04:28,180
OK, listen to me.

31
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,740
I need you to help me investigate one thing.

32
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:33,220
However, you have to be careful and alert.

33
00:04:33,460 --> 00:04:34,580
Can't make anyone wary.

34
00:04:39,420 --> 00:04:40,140
This person

35
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,340
bernama Zhu Jianhai.

36
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:42,420
People call him Hi.

37
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:44,580
His hometown is Hebei.

38
00:04:44,780 --> 00:04:46,100
He has been coming to Nanzhou for a long time.

39
00:04:46,580 --> 00:04:49,020
Previously, he was Feng Xiaosheng's driver and bodyguard

40
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:49,780
for seven to eight years.

41
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,540
In March this year,

42
00:04:52,180 --> 00:04:53,460
he was driving for work outside the province,

43
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,940
suddenly died of a heart attack.

44
00:04:56,900 --> 00:04:57,940
What do you want me to investigate?

45
00:04:58,500 --> 00:04:59,500
His death...

46
00:04:59,780 --> 00:05:00,980
is that true?

47
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,100
Is there just a name?

48
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:05,780
There is only this name and photo.

49
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:07,900
Don't know which hospital,

50
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:09,700
I also don't know the exact date.

51
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:13,820
Don't worry, I'll look into it.

52
00:05:14,140 --> 00:05:15,020
What is this person

53
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:16,980
something to do with Shen Shijie?

54
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:23,380
The age and height of this person and Shen Shijie were very similar.

55
00:05:24,180 --> 00:05:24,940
I'm suspicious

56
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,420
the person who jumped into the abyss...

57
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:28,140
actually is him.

58
00:05:32,140 --> 00:05:33,300
If possible,

59
00:05:34,180 --> 00:05:35,180
investigate too

60
00:05:35,420 --> 00:05:36,580
his other medical history.

61
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:38,780
Try to see if there are other clues or not.

62
00:05:40,620 --> 00:05:41,340
Understand.

63
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,180
If we can't prove it

64
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:45,740
Feng Xiaosheng adalah Shen Shijie,

65
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,660
but at least we can prove it

66
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:49,900
the dead person

67
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:50,900
bukanlah Shen Shijie.

68
00:05:54,740 --> 00:05:55,260
Already,

69
00:05:55,260 --> 00:05:56,820
time is really tight, I have to go back.

70
00:05:56,820 --> 00:05:57,780
You have to be careful, okay?

71
00:05:58,420 --> 00:05:59,020
Ying Ying.

72
00:06:01,140 --> 00:06:02,220
I have to go back.

73
00:06:02,580 --> 00:06:03,820
Otherwise, he would get suspicious.

74
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:09,540
Can't you escape from his side first?

75
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:14,780
The Feng family was his backing and fortress.

76
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:17,180
The sooner it brings down the Feng family,

77
00:06:17,820 --> 00:06:19,620
means getting rid of his accomplices more quickly.

78
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:21,540
That way it will be easier to deal with it.

79
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:24,580
I have to stay by his side,

80
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,500
use it,

81
00:06:25,540 --> 00:06:26,580
provoke him.

82
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:29,380
Quickly obtain evidence that the Feng family violated the law.

83
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:19,940
Reasonable.

84
00:07:22,260 --> 00:07:24,140
20 minutes faster than I expected.

85
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:33,380
I heard from them that you went on a date.

86
00:07:38,340 --> 00:07:39,100
Ke Ying.

87
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:41,420
Say it.

88
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:44,060
Apart from me, your fiancé,

89
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:46,220
Who can you still go on dates with?

90
00:08:04,340 --> 00:08:05,260
Reply me.

91
00:08:30,900 --> 00:08:32,050
You sent people to follow me?

92
00:08:34,540 --> 00:08:36,660
You never trusted me, right?

93
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:40,500
Believe?

94
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,060
In fact, I trust you too much.

95
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:52,660
Yang Yuze is back again, right?

96
00:08:54,300 --> 00:08:55,140
Of.

97
00:08:57,300 --> 00:08:59,020
Yang Yuze is back again.

98
00:09:00,100 --> 00:09:02,100
I did go to see him earlier.

99
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,620
How brave.

100
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:10,860
Ke Ying, on what basis?

101
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:13,620
On what basis do you dare to do this?

102
00:09:21,740 --> 00:09:23,620
Because you like me.

103
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,540
You know too

104
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,060
because I like you, okay?

105
00:09:29,740 --> 00:09:31,620
That's right, I do like you!

106
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,540
Because I like you,

107
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:35,660
So, you do whatever you want.

108
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,100
You really are given a heart asking for a heart!

109
00:09:37,100 --> 00:09:38,340
Think more rationally.

110
00:09:38,340 --> 00:09:39,780
I can't think rationally!

111
00:09:39,940 --> 00:09:40,500
If I'm rational,

112
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,660
I killed you from the start!

113
00:09:41,660 --> 00:09:42,540
You know, don't you?

114
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:44,460
What do you want to do?

115
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:46,420
Tell me, what do you want to do.

116
00:09:47,100 --> 00:09:48,060
What do you want to do?

117
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:48,940
Say.

118
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,380
What do you want to do?

119
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,260
What do you want to do?

120
00:09:52,380 --> 00:09:53,340
Shen Shijie,

121
00:09:53,740 --> 00:09:54,540
like this,

122
00:09:54,980 --> 00:09:57,060
Let me finish talking, then you'll throw a tantrum, okay?

123
00:09:57,740 --> 00:09:58,700
Of?

124
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:04,540
Of?

125
00:10:05,380 --> 00:10:06,740
Listen to my explanation first.

126
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:20,380
I really don't know.

127
00:10:21,180 --> 00:10:22,980
I didn't intentionally want to lie to you.

128
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:25,420
I didn't know Yang Yuze would come back.

129
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,100
He suddenly came to the press conference location looking for me.

130
00:10:28,660 --> 00:10:29,900
What method do I have?

131
00:10:30,180 --> 00:10:31,740
Can I really curse him and throw him out?

132
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:33,740
Or should I tell you straight away?

133
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:36,060
Then, you cut off another finger?

134
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:38,540
Tell me, what should I do?

135
00:10:40,340 --> 00:10:41,380
Shen Shijie,

136
00:10:41,900 --> 00:10:43,260
if you were me,

137
00:10:45,020 --> 00:10:46,060
what will you do?

138
00:10:46,460 --> 00:10:47,540
Apart from hiding it,

139
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,540
How can I still do it?

140
00:10:57,540 --> 00:10:58,780
You shouldn't lie to me.

141
00:11:02,660 --> 00:11:03,780
You'll regret it.

142
00:11:08,780 --> 00:11:09,660
Shen Shijie!

143
00:11:13,020 --> 00:11:14,140
If you dare touch her again,

144
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,220
I will...

145
00:11:15,460 --> 00:11:16,540
What will you do?

146
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:20,060
Kill me for him?

147
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:27,860
Where do I have the ability to kill you?

148
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:33,620
I already owe Yang Yuze a finger.

149
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:37,420
If you dare touch her again,

150
00:11:39,220 --> 00:11:41,620
I will redeem it with my life.

151
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:57,380
You threaten me using yourself?

152
00:12:00,780 --> 00:12:01,500
Of.

153
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:26,820
Nona,

154
00:12:26,820 --> 00:12:28,060
what do you think today?

155
00:12:28,460 --> 00:12:29,340
Pretty delicious.

156
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:47,940
Master Feng!

157
00:13:18,940 --> 00:13:19,860
Hello, Yuze.

158
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:21,660
Feng Xiaosheng already knows you're back.

159
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,420
I'm okay, it's okay.

160
00:13:24,420 --> 00:13:25,260
You go quickly.

161
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,140
Listen to me. I am alright.

162
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,620
You have to go quickly.

163
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,260
I'm really okay. You go quickly.

164
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,740
(Incoming Call; Alley)

165
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:54,700
Miao Miao, you can't go.

166
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:56,300
Why can't I go?

167
00:13:56,300 --> 00:13:58,300
If I don't go, won't all my previous efforts be in vain?

168
00:13:58,500 --> 00:13:59,340
Just let it go to waste,

169
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:00,460
that is better than encountering danger.

170
00:14:02,140 --> 00:14:03,580
As long as Lecturer Ke doesn't blow my cover,

171
00:14:03,580 --> 00:14:04,660
I won't be in danger.

172
00:14:04,660 --> 00:14:06,140
I understand the situation. Don't discuss it with you anymore.

173
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:09,700
Miao Miao.

174
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,220
Miao Miao!

175
00:14:17,620 --> 00:14:19,580
Later, if my grandmother asks, don't tell her, okay?

176
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,580
Don't!

177

(Universitas Nanzhou)

178
00:14:33,700 --> 00:14:34,420
Have arrived?

179
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,500
Already.

180
00:14:37,060 --> 00:14:39,220
I have activated and entered the cell phone number.

181
00:14:39,380 --> 00:14:40,500
Can be used immediately.

182
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,380
Good.

183
00:14:42,820 --> 00:14:44,500
Why was the cellphone thrown away again?

184
00:14:45,220 --> 00:14:46,220
His mood wasn't good.

185
00:14:51,100 --> 00:14:51,820
Sis,

186
00:14:53,540 --> 00:14:55,060
did you quarrel with Miss Ke?

187
00:14:57,980 --> 00:14:58,940
I guessed that, right?

188
00:15:00,060 --> 00:15:01,180
This afternoon your face is gloomy,

189
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:03,620
When you came out, An and the others were scared.

190
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:06,020
Don't blame me for being fussy,

191
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:08,100
I don't think you should eat with Journalist Lian.

192
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,060
He is actually evil.

193
00:15:10,060 --> 00:15:11,540
Want to pit you and Miss Ke against each other.

194
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,180
This woman's intention

195
00:15:13,260 --> 00:15:14,700
too much, really.

196
00:15:15,860 --> 00:15:16,420
Drink.

197
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:37,900
Sis,

198
00:15:39,220 --> 00:15:40,140
I'll tell you, yeah.

199
00:15:40,860 --> 00:15:41,980
Regarding women,

200
00:15:42,220 --> 00:15:44,180
don't take it too seriously.

201
00:15:44,940 --> 00:15:45,940
Sometimes more faces are given,

202
00:15:45,940 --> 00:15:46,940
he was getting more and more shameless.

203
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,860
Sometimes if you leave it for two days,

204
00:15:48,940 --> 00:15:49,820
on the contrary,

205
00:15:49,900 --> 00:15:51,500
he will run to come to you.

206
00:15:52,540 --> 00:15:53,980
Even though this is all just my imagination,

207
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:55,380
You also know I have no experience.

208
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,380
I don't know how to comfort you either.

209
00:15:58,700 --> 00:16:00,180
Let's drink, come on.

210
00:16:05,620 --> 00:16:06,900
How is your relationship with...

211
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,340
si Fenfang itu?

212
00:16:08,620 --> 00:16:10,460
Fen...Fenfang?

213
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,020
That...

214
00:16:11,460 --> 00:16:12,540
Fenfang...

215
00:16:13,820 --> 00:16:14,900
Reasonable.

216
00:16:15,340 --> 00:16:16,900
I've gone out to eat with him several times.

217
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:20,780
Make good use of that opportunity.

218
00:16:27,220 --> 00:16:28,860
What are you doing? No eyes, huh?

219
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,780
Sorry, sorry Mr. Feng.

220
00:16:34,500 --> 00:16:35,580
Go, go, go.

221
00:16:36,420 --> 00:16:37,740
I've met you.

222
00:16:40,140 --> 00:16:40,860
You...

223
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,180
Do you remember me?

224
00:16:46,260 --> 00:16:47,980
You're following me.

225
00:16:53,820 --> 00:16:55,100
No, who are you?

226
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,060
What are you doing?

227
00:16:56,700 --> 00:16:57,300
Nope.

228
00:16:57,700 --> 00:16:59,220
You guys misunderstood.

229
00:16:59,820 --> 00:17:02,260
I'm just one of Mr. Feng's fans.

230
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,020
That day,

231
00:17:03,020 --> 00:17:04,620
in the car park of Mr. Feng's office,

232
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:06,220
I once asked for his autograph.

233
00:17:06,940 --> 00:17:07,980
All of Mr. Feng's reports,

234
00:17:07,980 --> 00:17:08,860
I've heard of it.

235
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:11,420
Mr. Feng,

236
00:17:12,290 --> 00:17:13,540
I beg you.

237
00:17:13,660 --> 00:17:15,290
Because I really admire you,

238
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:16,660
please don't complain about me.

239
00:17:17,050 --> 00:17:18,570
If the manager finds out,

240
00:17:19,050 --> 00:17:20,330
he will definitely scold me again

241
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:21,900
and cut my salary.

242
00:18:11,580 --> 00:18:12,980
Today I drank quite a lot.

243
00:18:12,980 --> 00:18:13,580
Slowly.

244
00:18:13,580 --> 00:18:14,340
Very happy.

245
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:14,940
Come on, watch your step.

246
00:18:15,180 --> 00:18:17,460
I'm so happy to have a drink with you.

247
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:21,340
True papah, good papah Tuan Feng.

248
00:18:21,340 --> 00:18:22,300
I opened the door.

249
00:18:25,060 --> 00:18:26,340
Take Mr. Feng home.

250
00:18:26,580 --> 00:18:27,500
Be careful on the way.

251
00:18:27,500 --> 00:18:28,340
Fine.

252
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:30,620
Mr. Feng, You are careful, be careful.

253
00:18:42,460 --> 00:18:43,620
Be careful, Mr. Feng!

254
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:49,700
See you, Sis Wu!

255
00:18:50,540 --> 00:18:51,500
See you soon.

256
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:54,940
(Sorry,)

257
00:18:55,220 --> 00:18:57,420
(the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

258
00:18:57,420 --> 00:18:58,060
(Sorry,)

259
00:18:58,380 --> 00:18:59,500
(the number you dialed...)

260
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:38,540
Mr. Feng.

261
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:41,620
Mr. Feng.

262
00:20:59,260 --> 00:21:03,400
(Panggilan Masuk; Yu Chengbo)

263
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:11,900
Halo.

264
00:21:12,300 --> 00:21:13,220
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

265
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,380
Miao Miao could not be contacted.

266
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:15,460
The cell phone is dead.

267
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,420
Still can't be contacted.

268
00:21:17,140 --> 00:21:18,180
Isn't he coming home?

269
00:21:18,540 --> 00:21:19,300
Don't know.

270
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:20,780
In Miao Miao's house there is only her grandmother.

271
00:21:21,300 --> 00:21:23,060
He was afraid that his grandmother would find out he worked at the club.

272
00:21:23,300 --> 00:21:24,740
So, for some time now he has been lying,

273
00:21:24,980 --> 00:21:25,940
said he was preparing for the exam,

274
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:26,900
continue to stay at school.

275
00:21:28,060 --> 00:21:29,860
Don't panic, calm yourself first.

276
00:21:30,620 --> 00:21:31,980
You call the dorm.

277
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,980
Ask his friends.

278
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:33,860
Let's see if he's home or not.

279
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:35,180
Miao Miao hasn't come home yet.

280
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:37,300
I asked the people at the club earlier,

281
00:21:37,500 --> 00:21:38,940
Feng Xiaosheng had time to come tonight.

282
00:21:39,300 --> 00:21:40,460
Miao Miao continued to stay in the private room,

283
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:41,300
and drink with him.

284
00:21:56,980 --> 00:21:57,940
I will contact Feng Xiaosheng.

285
00:21:57,940 --> 00:21:58,860
You go to Miao Miao's house immediately,

286
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,060
See if he's actually home or not.

287
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,300
Good.

288
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:03,420
However, if Grandma Chen asked,

289
00:22:03,540 --> 00:22:04,900
I'm afraid I can't lie to him.

290
00:22:05,020 --> 00:22:06,260
Then just tell the truth!

291
00:22:21,620 --> 00:22:24,000
(Incoming Call; That Woman)

292
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,780
Crazy, yeah. Constantly calling.

293
00:22:40,780 --> 00:22:41,500
Gila, of?

294
00:22:41,500 --> 00:22:42,860
Constantly calling here.

295
00:22:49,220 --> 00:22:50,460
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

296
00:22:50,900 --> 00:22:52,300
Don't call here again.

297
00:22:52,300 --> 00:22:53,780
You'll just wake Feng Xiaosheng up.

298
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:57,780
Don't worry, nothing will happen to me.

299
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:58,660
I'll close first!

300
00:22:58,740 --> 00:22:59,660
Miao Miao!

301
00:24:04,220 --> 00:24:04,820
That's it.

302
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:06,060
Talk about serious things.

303
00:24:06,660 --> 00:24:07,700
Regarding the Aoxin car factory fire,

304
00:24:08,740 --> 00:24:09,420
is there any news yet?

305
00:24:13,820 --> 00:24:14,860
Investigate You Qiang.

306
00:24:17,660 --> 00:24:18,660
After a car factory fire,

307
00:24:18,660 --> 00:24:20,340
You Qiang continued to not appear.

308
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:21,460
Previously said,

309
00:24:21,820 --> 00:24:23,060
his wife's birthday.

310
00:24:23,060 --> 00:24:25,220
Then there are families who get married and go to the wedding.

311
00:24:25,460 --> 00:24:27,180
Every time I call, it's always unclear.

312
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,420
Haven't said much yet, it's closed.

313
00:24:28,580 --> 00:24:29,540
Quickly investigate him.

314
00:24:37,980 --> 00:24:38,540
Halo.

315
00:24:40,860 --> 00:24:41,740
What's the matter?

316
00:24:48,660 --> 00:24:50,260
Last night when you had dinner with Feng Xiaosheng,

317
00:24:50,260 --> 00:24:51,780
Beside him is a little maid, right?

318
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:55,420
Cheer up a little.

319
00:24:55,420 --> 00:24:56,500
Come on, keep drinking.

320
00:24:56,940 --> 00:24:57,700
There is one.

321
00:24:58,260 --> 00:24:59,260
That is Miao Miao!

322
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:01,620
Miao Miao from the Chen family.

323
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:02,740
I...

324
00:25:03,860 --> 00:25:05,620
No, why did he go to Jujinxiao again?

325
00:25:06,220 --> 00:25:07,220
Don't you recognize him?

326
00:25:07,300 --> 00:25:08,540
I don't recognize him.

327
00:25:08,820 --> 00:25:10,060
That time with Dao Jian,

328
00:25:10,460 --> 00:25:11,620
When I was riding in the car I saw him

329
00:25:11,620 --> 00:25:12,780
then, covered with a police uniform.

330
00:25:13,020 --> 00:25:14,420
I couldn't see his face clearly at all.

331
00:25:17,700 --> 00:25:19,540
After the banquet, where did Miao Miao go?

332
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:22,100
I didn't notice it.

333
00:25:24,100 --> 00:25:25,820
Maybe he went with Feng Xiaosheng?

334
00:25:26,300 --> 00:25:26,820
I'm looking for him.

335
00:25:26,820 --> 00:25:27,540
Return!

336
00:25:29,300 --> 00:25:30,820
Don't reveal your identity.

337
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,300
Stay cool.

338
00:25:44,900 --> 00:25:46,900
Is that Miss Lecturer Ke?

339
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:49,100
Yes, that's right, Miss Lecturer Ke.

340
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,900
What is Miss Lecturer?

341
00:25:54,540 --> 00:25:55,220
Bu Ke.

342
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,740
Bu Ke.

343
00:25:55,740 --> 00:25:56,260
Grandma.

344
00:25:56,340 --> 00:25:59,300
Please please save Miao Miao.

345
00:25:59,660 --> 00:26:00,540
Have you reported the police?

346
00:26:00,540 --> 00:26:01,100
Already.

347
00:26:01,100 --> 00:26:02,180
The police just came in.

348
00:26:02,260 --> 00:26:04,700
Also called Uncle Chen's former comrade in arms.

349
00:26:04,740 --> 00:26:05,860
They are rushing here.

350
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:07,420
Grandma,

351
00:26:07,940 --> 00:26:09,860
we just went in and checked the CCTV inside.

352
00:26:10,140 --> 00:26:12,380
We found out that your grandson himself got into the car.

353
00:26:13,140 --> 00:26:14,140
The manager said here,

354
00:26:14,140 --> 00:26:15,700
your grandchildren know the guest.

355
00:26:15,860 --> 00:26:17,740
He himself was the one who proposed taking the guests home.

356
00:26:17,740 --> 00:26:19,100
No, no, no way.

357
00:26:19,300 --> 00:26:20,780
Definitely impossible.

358
00:26:21,060 --> 00:26:22,220
Definitely impossible.

359
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,180
The cell phone is dead.

360
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:24,700
The person can no longer be contacted.

361
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,980
This information cannot be proven

362
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:28,140
that he had been taken hostage.

363
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:28,780
May be

364
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:30,020
his cellphone ran out of battery.

365
00:26:30,700 --> 00:26:31,260
You guys...

366
00:26:31,260 --> 00:26:31,740
Mr Police.

367
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:32,500
You guys have to hurry

368
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:35,540
save the child for me.

369
00:26:35,540 --> 00:26:36,780
(Incoming Call; Feng Xiaosheng)

370
00:26:36,780 --> 00:26:37,380
Let's make it like this,

371
00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:38,100
Grandma,

372
00:26:39,300 --> 00:26:40,540
Don't panic yet.

373
00:26:40,860 --> 00:26:41,740
Wait for this information, we...

374
00:26:41,740 --> 00:26:42,740
Don't, Mr. Feng,

375
00:26:42,820 --> 00:26:43,780
You misunderstood.

376
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:45,340
Misunderstanding?

377
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,780
What did I misunderstand?

378
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:47,940
You guys have to believe me.

379
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,780
We believe you, believe you.

380
00:26:49,780 --> 00:26:50,580
Trust me.

381
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:53,500
We will definitely try.

382
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:55,020
We will definitely try.

383
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:55,900
Please you believe in us.

384
00:26:55,900 --> 00:26:56,820
Have to trust us.

385
00:26:57,620 --> 00:26:57,980
Stay cool.

386
00:26:57,980 --> 00:26:58,820
This is all our job.

387
00:26:58,820 --> 00:26:59,740
Grandma, don't panic.

388
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,420
The police said they would definitely find him.

389
00:27:00,420 --> 00:27:01,140
(Sorry,)

390
00:27:01,460 --> 00:27:03,700
(the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

391
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:19,540
You guys go quickly.

392
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,300
Sister Kan,

393
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:24,180
what's wrong with Zhu Di?

394
00:27:25,140 --> 00:27:26,980
He lied to his family and worked here.

395
00:27:27,060 --> 00:27:28,780
Accidentally discovered.

396
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:32,260
Her family thought her daughter was a good girl.

397
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,620
It was unexpected that he had fallen into promiscuity.

398
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,620
Kan's sister

399
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,060
Miss Ke.

400
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:43,260
Very cool.

401
00:27:43,780 --> 00:27:44,940
It's already this hour,

402
00:27:44,940 --> 00:27:46,940
what wind brought you here?

403
00:27:47,780 --> 00:27:48,860
Feng Xiaosheng ada di mana?

404
00:27:51,500 --> 00:27:52,980
Mr. Feng has left.

405
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:54,700
I ask you,

406
00:27:54,780 --> 00:27:55,820
Feng Xiaosheng ada di mana?

407
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:57,300
Where did he take the little girl?

408
00:27:57,580 --> 00:27:58,940
What little girl?

409
00:27:59,180 --> 00:28:01,900
What you're talking about... why don't I really understand?

410
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:04,020
You understand very well.

411
00:28:06,140 --> 00:28:07,940
Mr. Feng did have a little fun here,

412
00:28:08,140 --> 00:28:09,260
drink some alcohol.

413
00:28:09,340 --> 00:28:10,460
However, he was long gone.

414
00:28:10,700 --> 00:28:12,140
I also don't know where he went.

415
00:28:12,180 --> 00:28:13,020
Isn't he coming home?

416
00:28:13,100 --> 00:28:15,820
You know clearly my purpose in coming here.

417
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:18,860
I will give you face and ask you one last time.

418
00:28:19,660 --> 00:28:20,940
Feng Xiaosheng ada di mana?

419
00:28:21,500 --> 00:28:22,620
my sister,

420
00:28:22,900 --> 00:28:24,780
I can't watch him all the time for you.

421
00:28:28,140 --> 00:28:29,060
Feng Xiaosheng!

422
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:30,540
Get out!

423
00:28:30,860 --> 00:28:31,740
- Maaf. - Feng Xiaosheng!

424
00:28:31,740 --> 00:28:32,540
It's okay, it's okay.

425
00:28:33,140 --> 00:28:33,780
Feng Xiaosheng, kau di mana?

426
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:34,820
Hurry out!

427
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:36,020
What's wrong, Brother Kan?

428
00:28:36,020 --> 00:28:36,900
Feng Xiaosheng, kau di mana?

429
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,340
I'm sorry.

430
00:28:37,500 --> 00:28:38,460
Get out quickly!

431
00:28:38,460 --> 00:28:39,140
You've gone crazy, huh?

432
00:28:39,500 --> 00:28:40,700
- Maaf. - Feng Xiaosheng!

433
00:28:40,700 --> 00:28:41,380
Feng Xiaosheng!

434
00:28:41,380 --> 00:28:42,580
It's okay, it's okay. My fault.

435
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,140
- Feng Xiaosheng! - Sorry, sorry.

436
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:44,900
Feng Xiaosheng!

437
00:28:46,580 --> 00:28:47,420
Miss Ke,

438
00:28:47,420 --> 00:28:48,540
dearest youngest brother.

439
00:28:48,540 --> 00:28:50,060
Look, are you done making trouble?

440
00:28:50,260 --> 00:28:52,180
Don't bother employees like me.

441
00:28:52,180 --> 00:28:53,100
You're satisfied making trouble, right?

442
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,900
The last one to say this to me was Wu.

443
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,780
I took the pen and punched his hand.

444
00:28:57,780 --> 00:28:58,820
Until now it still hasn't healed.

445
00:28:58,820 --> 00:29:00,340
After leaving the doors of this club, he...

446
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,260
Sister Kan,

447
00:29:02,460 --> 00:29:04,060
what happened to Mr. Feng just now?

448
00:29:04,460 --> 00:29:05,740
Why can't the cell phone be contacted?

449
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:10,540
Now I immediately contact the driver who took Mr. Feng.

450
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,220
Fine.

451
00:29:11,740 --> 00:29:12,540
Fast.

452
00:29:17,300 --> 00:29:17,980
Halo.

453
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,060
Where did you leave Mr. Feng?

454
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:23,620
Fine, I understand.

455
00:29:28,020 --> 00:29:30,420
The driver said he was taking Mr. Feng to the Grand Hyatt Hotel,

456
00:29:30,580 --> 00:29:31,780
like 2311.

457
00:29:31,780 --> 00:29:32,580
Hyatt?

458
00:29:33,300 --> 00:29:34,100
Thank You.

459
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:34,940
Thank you, Sister Kan.

460
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,700
Sorry for bothering you.

461
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:39,860
OK, we'll try.

462
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:41,060
- You don't panic. - Thank You.

463
00:29:41,060 --> 00:29:42,260
We will try, don't panic.

464
00:29:42,260 --> 00:29:43,380
They're at the Hyatt Hotel.

465
00:29:43,700 --> 00:29:44,660
You guys quickly save him.

466
00:29:46,060 --> 00:29:46,860
How?

467
00:29:46,860 --> 00:29:48,060
You guys go quickly.

468
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:50,580
Hurry up.

469
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:51,980
They are both adults.

470
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:54,060
The women themselves are willing to do this.

471
00:29:54,340 --> 00:29:55,540
He was not forced either.

472
00:29:56,020 --> 00:29:57,380
This... this... this...

473
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,700
Miss Ke,

474
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:03,260
get in my car.

475
00:30:04,020 --> 00:30:04,940
Come behind me.

476
00:30:17,420 --> 00:30:18,260
Quickly follow.

477
00:30:18,260 --> 00:30:18,900
Good.

478
00:30:27,180 --> 00:30:28,460
(Don't, Lord Feng,)

479
00:30:28,460 --> 00:30:29,700
(You misunderstood.)

480
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,620
I'll just go.

481
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:36,340
You can survive until today

482
00:31:37,940 --> 00:31:39,300
It must not be easy, right?

483
00:31:42,780 --> 00:31:43,620
Hide well.

484
00:31:44,580 --> 00:31:45,380
I can.

485
00:32:00,420 --> 00:32:01,220
Be careful.

486
00:32:21,660 --> 00:32:23,180
Feng Xiaosheng, hurry out!

487
00:32:23,180 --> 00:32:24,300
I know you're in there!

488
00:32:25,100 --> 00:32:26,060
Feng Xiaosheng!

489
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:32,500
Di mana Miao Miao?

490
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,460
Miao Miao.

491
00:32:36,980 --> 00:32:37,860
Miao Miao.

492
00:32:39,220 --> 00:32:40,220
Miss me?

493
00:32:41,420 --> 00:32:42,500
I ask you, where is Miao Miao?

494
00:32:45,180 --> 00:32:45,980
According to you?

495
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:59,220
You couldn't have come because you were jealous, right?

496
00:32:59,700 --> 00:33:00,580
What an animal!

497
00:33:08,580 --> 00:33:09,740
Beautiful Sister,

498
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:11,620
you must have misunderstood.

499
00:33:11,900 --> 00:33:14,380
Tuan Feng and I did nothing at all.

500
00:33:16,580 --> 00:33:17,900
Mr. Feng is just drunk,

501
00:33:18,340 --> 00:33:19,700
I am a waiter at the club.

502
00:33:19,980 --> 00:33:21,540
I was responsible for bringing him here.

503
00:33:22,460 --> 00:33:24,300
I was the one who answered your call.

504
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:26,740
I wanted to explain it,

505
00:33:27,100 --> 00:33:28,700
but you closed it too quickly.

506
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,500
This is really just a misunderstanding.

507
00:33:30,900 --> 00:33:31,860
There is no misunderstanding.

508
00:33:31,860 --> 00:33:32,820
Nobody blames you.

509
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,420
Come in and rest for a while.

510
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:37,380
I want to talk to him about adult matters.

511
00:33:41,220 --> 00:33:42,340
Is what he said true?

512
00:33:45,500 --> 00:33:47,620
Do you think what he said was true or a lie?

513
00:33:50,500 --> 00:33:52,260
Do you think you're really smart?

514
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,540
Or do you think I'm stupid?

515
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:02,900
What's wrong with you again?

516
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:06,020
You think if you come,

517
00:34:06,020 --> 00:34:07,780
can you take the girl away?

518
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:09,980
Only with your abilities,

519
00:34:10,690 --> 00:34:11,690
Bu Ke?

520
00:34:14,690 --> 00:34:16,940
You can't possibly think that I really like you, right?

521
00:34:22,460 --> 00:34:23,740
If I really want to do something,

522
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:25,100
do you think you can stop me?

523
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:32,460
He is my student.

524
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,060
Still a child.

525
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,610
He just wants to uphold justice for me.

526
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:36,650
Still dare to lie!

527
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,380
Is he really just your student?

528
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:40,340
I asked you,

529
00:34:41,580 --> 00:34:42,500
who is his father?

530
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:49,100
Shen Shijie,

531
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:51,610
what do you want to do?

532
00:34:51,610 --> 00:34:53,580
Shouldn't I be the one asking you that?

533
00:34:57,180 --> 00:34:58,380
You teased me first,

534
00:34:59,380 --> 00:35:00,980
then make me like you.

535
00:35:02,260 --> 00:35:03,220
So finally?

536
00:35:05,260 --> 00:35:06,500
Instead you secretly trapped me,

537
00:35:07,380 --> 00:35:08,980
thinking of ways to kill me.

538
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:13,420
What do you want to do?

539
00:35:22,660 --> 00:35:23,580
Miao Miao!

540
00:35:23,580 --> 00:35:25,180
Miao Miao!

541
00:35:25,420 --> 00:35:26,260
Miao Miao.

542
00:35:30,780 --> 00:35:31,700
I am alright.

543
00:35:32,260 --> 00:35:33,180
It's really okay.

544
00:35:34,660 --> 00:35:35,780
Please let me go.

545
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:38,820
Am I doing something illegal?

546
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,740
You want to catch me?

547
00:35:43,140 --> 00:35:44,060
This is a misunderstanding.

548
00:35:44,060 --> 00:35:45,180
Completely misunderstood.

549
00:35:47,140 --> 00:35:47,940
Bos,

550
00:35:50,100 --> 00:35:52,540
you guys... what are you doing?

551
00:35:52,980 --> 00:35:53,620
Release!

552
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,260
What are you doing?

553
00:35:54,260 --> 00:35:55,100
- What are you doing? - What are you doing?

554
00:35:55,140 --> 00:35:56,060
Stop it!

555
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,780
Let go.

556
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,260
What really happened?

557
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:06,780
Mr. Feng is drunk,

558
00:36:07,260 --> 00:36:08,780
I was asked to take him home.

559
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:09,820
It's that simple.

560
00:36:10,500 --> 00:36:11,660
Miao Miao, you don't have to be afraid.

561
00:36:11,780 --> 00:36:12,660
I am not afraid.

562
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:14,140
What I say is the truth.

563
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:15,580
From the start there was nothing.

564
00:36:25,380 --> 00:36:26,140
Kapten Xiao,

565
00:36:26,780 --> 00:36:28,100
give a logical explanation.

566
00:36:28,780 --> 00:36:29,620
This many people came,

567
00:36:29,620 --> 00:36:30,540
without asking anything,

568
00:36:30,620 --> 00:36:31,620
just play hands.

569
00:36:33,180 --> 00:36:34,460
Is this your special right?

570
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:35,940
Correct.

571
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,060
Can the police indiscriminately oppress people?

572
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,460
Feng, I tell you,

573
00:36:39,500 --> 00:36:40,820
Don't pretend to be nice here!

574
00:36:40,940 --> 00:36:41,620
I'm warning you.

575
00:36:41,620 --> 00:36:42,980
- What do you want to do? - Zhong! Zhong!

576
00:36:46,140 --> 00:36:48,380
If you don't even have a logical explanation,

577
00:36:49,740 --> 00:36:51,300
then I can only ask my lawyer

578
00:36:52,060 --> 00:36:53,500
looking for your boss

579
00:36:53,660 --> 00:36:54,780
to ask for a statement.

580
00:36:59,980 --> 00:37:01,780
Didn't this little girl say that earlier?

581
00:37:02,420 --> 00:37:03,260
This is all a misunderstanding.

582
00:37:03,700 --> 00:37:04,940
Pure misunderstanding.

583
00:37:05,700 --> 00:37:06,820
His family couldn't find him.

584
00:37:06,980 --> 00:37:07,980
Thinking there was a problem with him.

585
00:37:08,260 --> 00:37:09,500
Because I panicked, I reported it to the police.

586
00:37:10,420 --> 00:37:11,460
Are you still not coming home quickly?

587
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,900
Your grandmother is already panicking to death!

588
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:15,500
My grandmother also knows?

589
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:27,740
Mr. Feng,

590
00:37:28,660 --> 00:37:30,180
because the misunderstanding has been resolved,

591
00:37:30,780 --> 00:37:32,420
then everything is peaceful.

592
00:37:33,620 --> 00:37:35,380
We will not disturb your rest again.

593
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:36,220
Be careful on the way.

594
00:37:36,380 --> 00:37:37,260
See you soon.

595
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:40,900
Ayo.

596
00:37:47,500 --> 00:37:48,180
What do you see?

597
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,180
No, Boss, just leave it like that?

598
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:02,260
Looks like Kak Ke is really gone.

599
00:38:02,940 --> 00:38:03,500
What if

600
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:04,460
I take him back?

601
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,780
He looks really jealous.

602
00:38:06,940 --> 00:38:07,700
Wu,

603
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:11,260
that's it.

604
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,500
Return. Close the door.

605
00:38:19,380 --> 00:38:20,140
Bos,

606
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,820
don't blame me for nagging you,

607
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:23,420
but this time it's really you who are wrong.

608
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:25,460
If you want to cheat, well, just cheat.

609
00:38:25,460 --> 00:38:26,940
Why are you flirting with a girl in front of Kak Ke,

610
00:38:26,940 --> 00:38:28,100
until you know.

611
00:38:31,820 --> 00:38:32,780
Why did you suddenly come?

612
00:38:33,140 --> 00:38:33,980
Don't discuss it any more.

613
00:38:34,420 --> 00:38:35,260
I've slept,

614
00:38:35,260 --> 00:38:36,420
Sis Ke suddenly called me.

615
00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:37,580
He asked me where you were.

616
00:38:38,260 --> 00:38:39,700
His tone also sounded strange.

617
00:38:39,700 --> 00:38:41,420
I immediately called you, but you didn't pick up.

618
00:38:41,700 --> 00:38:43,220
Panicking, I headed straight for Jujinxiao.

619
00:38:43,220 --> 00:38:44,300
They just told me you were here.

620
00:38:50,220 --> 00:38:51,260
Accompany me for a drink.

621
00:38:51,380 --> 00:38:52,100
Good.

622
00:39:05,220 --> 00:39:09,100
(Police)

623
00:39:12,060 --> 00:39:12,380
Ayo.

624
00:39:12,620 --> 00:39:13,420
Come on, watch your head.

625
00:39:13,620 --> 00:39:15,380
Fine, fine, fine.

626
00:39:17,100 --> 00:39:17,780
Miao Miao!

627
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,380
Grandma.

628
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,220
- Miao Miao. - Grandma.

629
00:39:19,580 --> 00:39:20,180
You...

630
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,900
I'm okay, I'm really okay.

631
00:39:21,900 --> 00:39:23,020
I wasn't hurt in the slightest.

632
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:29,220
Grandma.

633
00:39:29,380 --> 00:39:30,100
Grandma.

634
00:39:31,420 --> 00:39:32,060
Grandma.

635
00:39:42,220 --> 00:39:43,060
Grandma!

636
00:39:55,180 --> 00:39:56,060
Bu Ke,

637
00:39:56,820 --> 00:39:59,180
Yu already told me in the car.

638
00:39:59,940 --> 00:40:01,540
I'm the one who apologizes to you.

639
00:40:01,820 --> 00:40:03,780
I didn't educate my grandson well.

640
00:40:04,460 --> 00:40:05,300
Make it happen

641
00:40:05,780 --> 00:40:07,220
trouble you.

642
00:40:09,900 --> 00:40:10,700
It doesn't matter.

643
00:40:11,380 --> 00:40:12,180
Your future

644
00:40:13,060 --> 00:40:14,260
take good care of him.

645
00:40:16,700 --> 00:40:18,020
If you weren't the one who came to mess up,

646
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:19,900
can Feng Xiaosheng know who I am?

647
00:40:20,260 --> 00:40:22,780
You inexplicably came on a rampage and messed everything up.

648
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:24,020
Still want to blame other people?

649
00:40:35,500 --> 00:40:36,980
You... you...

650
00:40:38,180 --> 00:40:39,540
- Grandma! - Grandma!

651
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:41,060
Hurry, hurry, hurry to the hospital!

652
00:40:42,060 --> 00:40:43,500
Hurry, hurry, hurry!

653
00:40:46,220 --> 00:40:46,900
Be careful head.

654
00:40:47,740 --> 00:40:48,500
Slowly. Plans.

655
00:40:48,620 --> 00:40:49,540
Be careful, be careful.

656
00:40:58,580 --> 00:40:59,780
Slowly, carefully.

657
00:40:59,780 --> 00:41:00,660
Bu Ke.

658
00:41:14,140 --> 00:41:16,900
Kau bilang, Feng Xiaosheng adalah Shen Shijie?

659
00:41:19,220 --> 00:41:19,980
Of.

660
00:41:21,220 --> 00:41:22,540
If so, what proof do you have?

661
00:41:26,260 --> 00:41:26,820
There isn't any.

662
00:41:53,780 --> 00:41:54,820
Feng Xiaosheng,

663
00:41:55,740 --> 00:41:56,780
your way is great.

664
00:41:57,380 --> 00:41:58,580
I salute you.

665
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:03,620
Can get praise from Mrs. Ke

666
00:42:03,620 --> 00:42:05,180
it's really not easy.

667
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,620
Bu Ke,

668
00:42:18,980 --> 00:42:19,980
next you...

669
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,540
what plans do you have?

670
00:42:27,500 --> 00:42:28,980
Preparing for my own death,

671
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,260
ok, no?

672
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:37,140
You won't.

673
00:42:38,780 --> 00:42:39,580
Correct.

674
00:42:41,300 --> 00:42:42,260
I won't do it.
