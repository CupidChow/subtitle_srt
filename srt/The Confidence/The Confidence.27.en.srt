2
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,000
=Episode 27=

3
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,380
Why didn't you turn on the lights after coming home?

4
00:01:35,540 --> 00:01:36,420
Just startled me.

5
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:37,900
Where are you going?

6
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:41,060
I am hungry,

7
00:01:42,380 --> 00:01:43,380
so, go out to buy food.

8
00:01:44,580 --> 00:01:45,300
Hungry?

9
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:48,420
Why not just order food if you're hungry?

10
00:01:56,580 --> 00:01:57,780
Where can I order this?

11
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:59,460
Cook it yourself and it's delicious.

12
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:02,140
Do you want to eat?

13
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,260
My cooking is delicious.

14
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:52,980
Sis Wu.

15
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:57,140
Lots of purchases.

16
00:02:57,900 --> 00:02:58,740
Why do you wake up so early?

17
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:00,060
You...

18
00:03:00,580 --> 00:03:01,620
not completely healed yet.

19
00:03:03,620 --> 00:03:04,780
No, it's healed.

20
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,220
I heard that it was your second uncle who beat you up?

21
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:12,980
Nope.

22
00:03:13,780 --> 00:03:14,540
Isn't it?

23
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:19,300
Does that mean you were injured when the police searched for money lost previously?

24
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:21,460
Yes, that time.

25
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:23,940
Actually, it's my own fault.

26
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:25,700
At that time, I thought it was just a sprain.

27
00:03:25,700 --> 00:03:26,460
Don't take it seriously.

28
00:03:26,780 --> 00:03:27,540
Finally found out,

29
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:29,020
What is the name...

30
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:31,460
torn heel ligaments.

31
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:32,420
Torn ligaments?

32
00:03:32,420 --> 00:03:33,220
That bad?

33
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:33,940
Not serious, not serious.

34
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:34,700
Already recovered.

35
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:35,260
Really.

36
00:03:35,260 --> 00:03:36,260
You see, he can run and jump.

37
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:36,820
Even a little...

38
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:37,380
Don't jump anymore.

39
00:03:37,660 --> 00:03:38,740
Be careful of spilling the soy milk.

40
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:40,580
Oh, yes, Sis Wu,

41
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,780
I also don't know what you like to eat,

42
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:42,940
So, I bought a little of everything.

43
00:03:42,940 --> 00:03:43,420
Look at it.

44
00:03:43,420 --> 00:03:45,060
There are dumplings, siomai and buns.

45
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:45,780
Some contain tausa,

46
00:03:45,780 --> 00:03:46,660
and there is soy milk too.

47
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:48,700
I just drink a cup of soy milk.

48
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:50,100
They are still sleeping inside.

49
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,220
You just bring it in for them.

50
00:03:55,780 --> 00:03:57,420
Pay attention to your feet, recover well, okay?

51
00:03:59,500 --> 00:04:00,140
Sis Wu.

52
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,140
Call me if you need anything.

53
00:04:02,260 --> 00:04:03,220
twenty four hours,

54
00:04:03,260 --> 00:04:04,220
ready to come at any time.

55
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:06,100
Good.

56
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:07,780
The soy milk is hot.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:08,740
Be careful drinking.

58
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:09,980
Thank You.

59
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,700
Exactly as you might expect.

60
00:04:50,540 --> 00:04:54,860
That person took Journalist Lian from the car factory to the Four Seasons Hotel,

61
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:00,420
played a charade with David to completely trick Journalist Lian.

62
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,860
An elite kid who grew up in a greenhouse,

63
00:05:06,260 --> 00:05:08,260
conned by street thugs.

64
00:05:09,580 --> 00:05:10,940
Not strange at all.

65
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:15,940
The list of members of the European investigation team formed by the provincial government has been released.

66
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:18,940
The name of Deputy Mayor Lian is included in it.

67
00:05:21,740 --> 00:05:23,340
At a critical moment like this,

68
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:26,660
if Deputy Mayor Lian really leaves and doesn't come back,

69
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:30,220
we will definitely be dragged along.

70
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,580
Don't let him run away.

71
00:05:34,740 --> 00:05:35,620
At least,

72
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,460
can't let him run away first.

73
00:05:40,060 --> 00:05:41,220
This is a bit difficult to handle.

74
00:05:42,380 --> 00:05:43,500
The one above that,

75
00:05:43,780 --> 00:05:45,260
already overwhelmed with his own affairs.

76
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:47,300
If we act now,

77
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,580
isn't it a little...

78
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:51,020
We cannot act directly.

79
00:05:52,540 --> 00:05:53,860
So, you mean...

80
00:05:55,060 --> 00:05:56,260
Think about it first

81
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:58,700
to hold him.

82
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:22,340
What time did you come home last night?

83
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:25,420
Mother.

84
00:06:26,060 --> 00:06:26,900
you

85
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:28,060
getting ready to go to work?

86
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:32,420
I have proposed to the mayor to form an investigation team

87
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,820
to investigate the matter of Aoxin New Energy Vehicle Company.

88
00:06:37,780 --> 00:06:38,380
Meanwhile, you

89
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:39,540
tidy up the ingredients you have prepared

90
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:41,260
and hand it over to Secretary Fan.

91
00:06:42,180 --> 00:06:42,860
Of course,

92
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,460
if you feel uneasy,

93
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:46,060
You can also report with your real name.

94
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:47,300
No more, Mom.

95
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,620
At this time, a slight problem arose in my investigation.

96
00:06:58,420 --> 00:06:59,420
What happened?

97
00:07:01,340 --> 00:07:02,180
That...

98
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:04,780
the truth of the material I investigated,

99
00:07:05,540 --> 00:07:06,900
now I

100
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:08,060
not too sure about that.

101
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:11,340
Why are you so fickle?

102
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:12,340
You're basic.

103
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,540
Didn't you who was full of confidence tell me that

104
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,060
the factory is not operating,

105
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:17,500
the material warehouse is empty,

106
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,860
and the engineers are all fake?

107
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:21,180
Now you're saying that's not true?

108
00:07:21,580 --> 00:07:23,180
Is this how you investigate cases as a journalist?

109
00:07:24,980 --> 00:07:26,180
However, investigate it again

110
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:28,620
there's nothing to lose either.

111
00:07:28,900 --> 00:07:31,260
This is called wasting government resources, do you understand?

112
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,860
That's it.

113
00:07:38,460 --> 00:07:39,580
Since it's like this,

114
00:07:40,420 --> 00:07:41,580
investigate, yes, just investigate.

115
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:42,900
After I came back from Europe,

116
00:07:42,980 --> 00:07:43,940
if it turns out there is no problem,

117
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:45,460
can also be considered as providing an explanation to the public.

118
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:46,780
Mother.

119
00:07:50,780 --> 00:07:52,140
When are you going to Europe?

120
00:07:52,860 --> 00:07:53,860
The flight is Saturday.

121
00:07:56,100 --> 00:07:57,540
Bring me a gift, okay?

122
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,020
Don't want to.

123
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:01,860
My ticket is only one way.

124
00:08:02,180 --> 00:08:03,620
I'm ready to escape punishment.

125
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:06,820
Can you please stop being so calculating?

126
00:08:10,620 --> 00:08:12,700
You, I want to bite it.

127
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,740
You won't have the heart.

128
00:08:42,930 --> 00:08:43,780
Fan,

129
00:08:45,260 --> 00:08:46,060
your job

130
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:47,540
how far has it been set?

131
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:49,380
Everything is almost ready.

132
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,140
Don't talk too much to your family,

133
00:08:54,220 --> 00:08:55,740
so as not to add to the problem.

134
00:08:56,940 --> 00:08:57,700
Good.

135
00:08:58,460 --> 00:09:01,100
Just consider it a normal business trip.

136
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:03,700
Understand.

137
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:11,940
Fan,

138
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:15,460
in this life,

139
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:18,420
both husband and wife,

140
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:19,660
parents and children,

141
00:09:20,020 --> 00:09:20,980
basically,

142
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:23,180
all this is just a match.

143
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:25,460
At a critical moment,

144
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:27,020
can't doubt.

145
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:29,780
Understand?

146
00:09:31,820 --> 00:09:32,580
Understand.

147
00:09:33,140 --> 00:09:33,820
Understand.

148
00:09:34,180 --> 00:09:37,380
This time I can include you on the list is also not easy.

149
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:39,580
Don't let the problem get bigger.

150
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:42,140
You just calm down.

151
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:43,300
It will not happen.

152
00:09:45,300 --> 00:09:47,660
As long as you are alive, there is hope.

153
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:50,100
Keep yourself safe first,

154
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:53,780
Next things will slowly get better.

155
00:09:55,580 --> 00:09:56,500
In other words,

156
00:09:56,860 --> 00:09:58,420
don't you still live on the same earth?

157
00:09:58,780 --> 00:09:59,740
What do you think?

158
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,380
Correct.

159
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:15,460
Doctor Zhou.

160
00:10:16,460 --> 00:10:17,380
Doctor Zhou?

161
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:19,500
He tells you to change hands.

162
00:10:32,500 --> 00:10:33,620
Boss, I...

163
00:10:39,220 --> 00:10:40,940
How long has your illness been?

164
00:10:42,140 --> 00:10:42,940
I...

165
00:10:44,100 --> 00:10:45,220
two or three months, maybe?

166
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:47,380
Two or three months?

167
00:10:50,740 --> 00:10:51,580
Three or four months?

168
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:52,980
More or less like that.

169
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:54,900
Tongue.

170
00:10:56,180 --> 00:10:57,220
Tongue.

171
00:11:03,820 --> 00:11:04,620
son,

172
00:11:05,260 --> 00:11:06,860
I will write a recipe for you.

173
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:09,820
Twice a day, consumed seven days in a row.

174
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:13,260
However, you still need to maintain psychological health,

175
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:15,020
followed by taking medication,

176
00:11:15,500 --> 00:11:17,060
only then can there be results.

177
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,260
I... I don't want to take medicine.

178
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:25,100
Doctor Zhou, I have no other intentions.

179
00:11:25,100 --> 00:11:26,860
I just feel like I'm drinking traditional medicine

180
00:11:27,380 --> 00:11:28,460
very troublesome.

181
00:11:37,100 --> 00:11:38,140
Wait for me downstairs.

182
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,940
Good.

183
00:11:39,770 --> 00:11:41,770
(High medical ethics are effective for healing)

184
00:11:57,700 --> 00:11:58,620
Wait for me downstairs.

185
00:12:11,300 --> 00:12:12,260
Fine.

186
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,500
I'll send it to you later.

187
00:12:13,900 --> 00:12:14,540
I'll close it, okay?

188
00:12:42,380 --> 00:12:43,140
Nona,

189
00:12:43,620 --> 00:12:44,980
the recipe given above,

190
00:12:44,980 --> 00:12:46,260
redeem the medicine here, right?

191
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:47,940
Correct.

192
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:53,020
Is there a discount when buying medicine here?

193
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:55,940
10 percent discount for existing customers.

194
00:12:56,100 --> 00:12:57,020
If so, it's easy.

195
00:12:57,300 --> 00:12:58,500
I just use my sister's card.

196
00:12:58,500 --> 00:12:59,420
Mr. Feng.

197
00:12:59,580 --> 00:13:01,780
He must be your old customer, right?

198
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:03,020
Can't.

199
00:13:03,020 --> 00:13:04,180
You should ask Doctor Zhou.

200
00:13:04,780 --> 00:13:05,820
Who is Doctor Zhou?

201
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,780
In my opinion, your face looks like the one who takes care of this place.

202
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:10,340
Isn't it just a matter of giving us a 90 percent discount?

203
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:14,540
Nona,

204
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,980
what's your zodiac sign?

205
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:19,540
Libra.

206
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:20,620
Libra?

207
00:13:20,860 --> 00:13:22,340
What's your rising sign?

208
00:13:25,500 --> 00:13:26,140
Gemini.

209
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,060
Gemini?

210
00:13:27,660 --> 00:13:28,660
Sorry, sorry.

211
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:30,180
Our zodiac signs are very compatible.

212
00:13:32,820 --> 00:13:35,420
The fire in his heart was too great.

213
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:37,620
No need to rush.

214
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:39,740
Can you tell me your date of birth?

215
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:41,500
Look at my mouth.

216
00:13:41,500 --> 00:13:43,060
Where can I ask a girl's age?

217
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,540
Hand lines are also possible.

218
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:45,740
I'm good at predicting hand lines.

219
00:13:45,740 --> 00:13:46,660
Inaccurate, no need to pay.

220
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,380
Really.

221
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:55,020
Why is your hand hurt?

222
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:56,660
Scratched.

223
00:13:56,740 --> 00:13:58,580
See, your wounds even form a mark of love for you.

224
00:14:05,300 --> 00:14:06,740
Mr. Feng, can we go now?

225
00:14:07,140 --> 00:14:08,300
Wrap and boil the medicine according to the prescription.

226
00:14:08,300 --> 00:14:09,300
Later I'll ask someone to come pick it up.

227
00:14:09,380 --> 00:14:10,060
Good.

228
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:11,620
Every time you pay,

229
00:14:11,660 --> 00:14:12,980
I really don't feel good.

230
00:14:13,620 --> 00:14:15,380
(Recipe)

231
00:14:16,780 --> 00:14:17,260
Thank you.

232
00:14:17,460 --> 00:14:17,820
Good.

233
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:18,380
Contact via WeChat.

234
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,860
Sis, I don't think I'm sick. No need to take medication.

235
00:14:44,120 --> 00:14:45,700
The doctor determines whether you are sick or not.

236
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,480
You always advise me not to be deceived.

237
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:51,540
I see this old man looks like a fraud. Just look at his look...

238
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:53,520
Halo.

239
00:14:53,720 --> 00:14:54,600
What was that?

240
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:56,040
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

241
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:58,220
a journalist surnamed Lian is looking for you.

242
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,280
He said he made a promise.

243
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:00,360
Good.

244
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:02,240
I'll be back right now.

245
00:15:03,340 --> 00:15:04,700
Ask Ke Ying to greet him first.

246
00:15:04,980 --> 00:15:05,580
Good.

247
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:10,720
To the company.

248
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:19,100
Journalist surnamed Lian?

249
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,500
Correct.

250
00:15:20,860 --> 00:15:21,780
The chairman of the board of directors said,

251
00:15:21,780 --> 00:15:23,500
told you to go greet him first.

252
00:15:23,940 --> 00:15:25,020
He will be back soon.

253
00:15:28,900 --> 00:15:30,140
OK, come on.

254
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,060
You just go back first.

255
00:15:47,300 --> 00:15:48,380
Good, Brother Ke.

256
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,380
Now you

257
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:12,620
has quit his job at the university

258
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:14,940
and specifically come here to work?

259
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:18,180
There are no lessons these days,

260
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,060
So, I helped him check the books.

261
00:16:24,020 --> 00:16:24,980
No wonder.

262
00:16:25,940 --> 00:16:27,820
Now Feng Xiaosheng is very confident.

263
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,140
Feng Xiaosheng let me into the company

264
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:31,020
and check the books as I please.

265
00:16:31,700 --> 00:16:33,180
Apparently, you are this genius

266
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,980
that helps him here.

267
00:16:37,180 --> 00:16:38,660
He let you come in and check the books?

268
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,180
Correct.

269
00:16:40,700 --> 00:16:43,860
He said I could come in and investigate at any time.

270
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:46,300
All project data

271
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,940
will be shown to me.

272
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,220
What do you want to check?

273
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:53,020
About Aoxin's car?

274
00:16:53,860 --> 00:16:54,820
Not this time.

275
00:16:55,580 --> 00:16:58,580
But the Yongzhou New City Chemical Factory project three years ago.

276
00:17:02,620 --> 00:17:03,500
About Aoxin car,

277
00:17:03,500 --> 00:17:04,580
have you finished investigating?

278
00:17:06,410 --> 00:17:07,300
You can say that.

279
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:08,620
A misunderstanding.

280
00:17:09,300 --> 00:17:10,340
A misunderstanding?

281
00:17:12,140 --> 00:17:13,060
Qiao Yu

282
00:17:13,300 --> 00:17:14,580
which led my research astray.

283
00:17:15,500 --> 00:17:16,580
He wanted to take advantage of this opportunity

284
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:17,930
to blackmail Feng Xiaosheng.

285
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,500
Then, after I verified it directly,

286
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:24,060
the material warehouse is not empty.

287
00:17:24,820 --> 00:17:26,020
Everything runs normally at the factory.

288
00:17:26,700 --> 00:17:27,740
David's Passport,

289
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:29,140
he is also the one who deliberately faked it.

290
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:30,980
Today I came

291
00:17:31,740 --> 00:17:33,100
just want to see

292
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,380
all data of Yongzhou New City Chemical Factory three years ago,

293
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:38,380
can

294
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:44,020
Yesterday you met outside,

295
00:17:45,140 --> 00:17:46,300
just talking about this?

296
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,700
You're really worried about this.

297
00:17:54,500 --> 00:17:55,420
I'm asking you,

298
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:57,380
What did you talk about when you met yesterday?

299
00:17:58,180 --> 00:18:00,100
Did you talk to him about the anonymous email?

300
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:04,340
Strange.

301
00:18:06,300 --> 00:18:07,500
Why should I tell you?

302
00:18:10,580 --> 00:18:12,140
With what identity are you interrogating me?

303
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,300
Is Feng Xiaosheng's fiancé?

304
00:18:21,780 --> 00:18:22,900
Lian Lian,

305
00:18:23,620 --> 00:18:25,180
can you not be so childish?

306
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:27,740
With thoughts like this, what investigative journalist do you want to be?

307
00:18:28,100 --> 00:18:30,260
Investigated here and there, but didn't reveal anything.

308
00:18:30,260 --> 00:18:31,540
It only makes other people and yourself tired.

309
00:18:31,540 --> 00:18:32,620
Say it again.

310
00:18:41,260 --> 00:18:42,460
OK, sorry.

311
00:18:42,940 --> 00:18:45,180
I was the one who lost control of my own emotions.

312
00:18:46,060 --> 00:18:47,380
My words are a bit exaggerated.

313
00:18:48,180 --> 00:18:49,180
I apologize to you.

314
00:18:50,380 --> 00:18:51,220
Sorry.

315
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:54,340
However,

316
00:18:55,540 --> 00:18:56,980
as a former friend,

317
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,100
I want to suggest one thing.

318
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:04,140
Don't investigate any projects related to the Feng Group anymore.

319
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:05,500
Whether it's Aoxin's car,

320
00:19:06,100 --> 00:19:07,260
and chemical factories.

321
00:19:07,860 --> 00:19:10,020
Because Aoxin's car case was a misunderstanding,

322
00:19:10,620 --> 00:19:11,820
hence the case of the chemical factory

323
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:13,700
most likely too

324
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:15,820
slandered by people with bad intentions.

325
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:18,860
What did you say just now?

326
00:19:22,020 --> 00:19:23,220
former friend,

327
00:19:24,860 --> 00:19:25,620
Is that true?

328
00:19:26,980 --> 00:19:27,700
Correct.

329
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,780
So true.

330
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,380
Former best friend.

331
00:19:33,460 --> 00:19:34,460
I advise you one more thing.

332
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,460
Jauhi Feng Xiaosheng.

333
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,620
Have you gone crazy?

334
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:42,460
You treat Feng Xiaosheng like a treasure,

335
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:45,620
Do you think all the women in this world are fighting over men with you?

336
00:19:56,700 --> 00:19:57,540
What is it?

337
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:03,980
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

338
00:20:04,460 --> 00:20:05,300
Sister Ke

339
00:20:05,740 --> 00:20:06,740
and Journalist Lian

340
00:20:06,740 --> 00:20:07,980
seems to be having a fight.

341
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:17,580
I suggest you clean your heart and mind.

342
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,580
Don't think dirty thoughts about everything.

343
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:23,140
Last night I was indeed with Feng Xiaosheng.

344
00:20:23,540 --> 00:20:25,380
However, we went to the car factory

345
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:27,260
to see the material warehouse.

346
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,460
Then, find David with him

347
00:20:30,260 --> 00:20:31,860
to check the authenticity of the passport.

348
00:20:33,260 --> 00:20:35,100
I didn't do anything wrong.

349
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,260
Do you understand?

350
00:20:43,620 --> 00:20:44,620
Everyone went back to work.

351
00:20:59,940 --> 00:21:00,780
What are you chatting about?

352
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:02,380
So happy.

353
00:21:03,260 --> 00:21:03,980
It doesn't matter.

354
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,620
Lian Lian,

355
00:21:13,940 --> 00:21:15,340
I know you've hated me all this time

356
00:21:15,580 --> 00:21:16,540
because of Yang Yuze.

357
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,700
I broke up with him,

358
00:21:21,700 --> 00:21:23,060
then you feel I betrayed him.

359
00:21:25,140 --> 00:21:26,620
You don't have to be mad at him.

360
00:21:27,060 --> 00:21:28,820
If you still like him, you can pursue him.

361
00:21:29,460 --> 00:21:30,580
Not even revenge on me.

362
00:21:36,100 --> 00:21:38,380
Do you think that if you succeed in snatching Feng Xiaosheng from me,

363
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:40,540
Can you prove you are better and more competent than me?

364
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:44,260
Feelings are not games.

365
00:21:45,140 --> 00:21:46,860
Not up for grabs.

366
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:49,860
Don't go.

367
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,740
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

368
00:21:56,580 --> 00:21:57,620
Journalist Lian said,

369
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:59,820
he came to check the books with your permission.

370
00:22:03,220 --> 00:22:03,860
Correct.

371
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:05,620
I don't agree.

372
00:22:06,220 --> 00:22:07,340
Mana can leave a journalist

373
00:22:07,580 --> 00:22:10,380
just walk into a company and see the company's trade secrets?

374
00:22:10,620 --> 00:22:12,220
If it spreads it would be a joke.

375
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,740
As personal assistant to the chairman of the board of directors,

376
00:22:16,980 --> 00:22:18,620
I don't allow things like this to happen.

377
00:22:19,740 --> 00:22:20,620
I say it clearly,

378
00:22:21,380 --> 00:22:22,820
there is him, there is no me, and vice versa.

379
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,820
He goes or I go,

380
00:22:25,620 --> 00:22:26,580
you just decide for yourself.

381
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,860
Ke Ying, don't go!

382
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:30,620
Explain what you mean!

383
00:22:30,620 --> 00:22:31,460
Journalist Lian.

384
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:33,380
You're crazy.

385
00:22:34,620 --> 00:22:35,620
He must be crazy.

386
00:22:36,740 --> 00:22:37,500
Stop!

387
00:22:40,140 --> 00:22:41,300
Don't look, don't look.

388
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:43,860
Journalist Lian,

389
00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,300
sorry

390
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,980
I was forced to respect my fiancé's wishes.

391
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:50,380
I'm so sorry,

392
00:22:51,020 --> 00:22:52,220
I had to break my promise to you.

393
00:22:53,140 --> 00:22:54,860
If you have other ways to investigate,

394
00:22:56,140 --> 00:22:57,340
I definitely won't stop you.

395
00:22:57,780 --> 00:22:59,020
Have you heard what he said?

396
00:22:59,100 --> 00:23:00,500
He's crazy now!

397
00:23:00,620 --> 00:23:01,980
Thank you for your diagnosis.

398
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,540
Please come back.

399
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:04,860
Wu,

400
00:23:05,500 --> 00:23:06,140
take him back.

401
00:23:06,140 --> 00:23:07,580
You two have all gone crazy!

402
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,260
What is this?

403
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,540
Don't go either!

404
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,500
You're crazy too!

405
00:23:15,300 --> 00:23:16,380
What are you looking at?

406
00:23:16,740 --> 00:23:17,380
Look no further, look no further.

407
00:23:17,380 --> 00:23:17,980
What kind of dilapidated place is this?

408
00:23:17,980 --> 00:23:18,620
Everyone is crazy!

409
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:19,380
Correct.

410
00:23:19,580 --> 00:23:20,820
Miss, I just came back from the hospital.

411
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,380
I'm not crazy.

412
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,820
What's the matter, you can tell me.

413
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:23,740
Mr. Feng is busy.

414
00:23:24,220 --> 00:23:25,260
Is there really any point in talking to you?

415
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,260
Get out!

416
00:23:30,580 --> 00:23:31,620
Feng Xiaosheng!

417
00:23:33,100 --> 00:23:33,780
Don't scream, don't scream.

418
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:34,860
Common area, common area.

419
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:35,620
Don't scream anymore.

420
00:23:36,460 --> 00:23:37,460
Still seeing?

421
00:23:39,620 --> 00:23:40,420
Move!

422
00:24:06,700 --> 00:24:07,540
Is it?

423
00:24:10,380 --> 00:24:11,260
Reasonable.

424
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,300
Can this be considered as making amends for my mistake?

425
00:24:28,340 --> 00:24:29,420
It's up to you to believe it or not,

426
00:24:30,260 --> 00:24:32,060
I have to say what I should say.

427
00:24:33,500 --> 00:24:34,540
A few days ago, I actually...

428
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:40,740
A few days ago, I did send an email to Lian Lian.

429
00:24:41,740 --> 00:24:43,460
I sent him a photo of David's passport.

430
00:24:43,580 --> 00:24:46,020
I just wanted him to help me examine who David really was.

431
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:47,740
I do not expect,

432
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,900
he was also investigating about Aoxin's car.

433
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:49,940
I didn't expect it any more,

434
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,620
he would go to the car factory and check the material warehouse.

435
00:24:54,220 --> 00:24:55,220
Before this,

436
00:24:55,540 --> 00:24:56,740
he was investigating

437
00:24:56,740 --> 00:24:58,500
Yongzhou New City Chemical Factory project.

438
00:25:09,180 --> 00:25:09,860
That's it.

439
00:25:10,500 --> 00:25:12,180
Besides, I said you wouldn't believe it either.

440
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:27,980
Do you know what is greatest about you?

441
00:25:31,300 --> 00:25:32,660
Didn't blink an eye at bullshit time?

442
00:25:33,060 --> 00:25:34,300
You seem quite self-aware.

443
00:25:35,420 --> 00:25:36,740
A man's value lies in how much he knows himself,

444
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,740
that exists from moral beauty.

445
00:25:44,300 --> 00:25:45,500
This is the last time.

446
00:25:47,140 --> 00:25:48,780
Don't test the limits of my patience,

447
00:25:50,260 --> 00:25:50,900
of?

448
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,620
View product competitive advantage analysis

449
00:26:06,620 --> 00:26:08,500
that the Sales Department gave me last month.

450
00:26:11,100 --> 00:26:12,100
Why is my vision suddenly dark?

451
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:13,100
Can't see anything.

452
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,020
Maybe low blood sugar.

453
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:14,940
Boss, do you have any candy here?

454
00:26:18,020 --> 00:26:18,780
No need to close it anymore.

455
00:26:18,780 --> 00:26:19,620
Come in.

456
00:26:21,100 --> 00:26:21,900
It's okay.

457
00:26:22,420 --> 00:26:23,180
What is it?

458
00:26:25,420 --> 00:26:27,660
I want to ask, are you using the car tonight?

459
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,100
If you don't use the car, I'll go to the club.

460
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,660
To the club for what?

461
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:32,660
Play cards.

462
00:26:32,940 --> 00:26:34,700
Hasn't Sis Qiang had a break lately?

463
00:26:34,740 --> 00:26:35,740
So, we agreed to play cards.

464
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:39,260
Don't waste time like that anymore.

465
00:26:39,620 --> 00:26:41,260
Tomorrow come to work at the company.

466
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,620
Aren't I working now?

467
00:26:42,620 --> 00:26:43,860
I'm also never late.

468
00:26:44,260 --> 00:26:45,460
I mean business units.

469
00:26:46,660 --> 00:26:47,420
Business units?

470
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:53,140
An,

471
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,140
is the item ready?

472
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:54,860
Already.

473
00:26:54,940 --> 00:26:55,820
Bring it in now.

474
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:57,060
Yes, Chairman of the Board of Directors.

475
00:27:03,860 --> 00:27:04,620
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

476
00:27:07,660 --> 00:27:08,420
Secretary An.

477
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:23,700
Deputy... president?

478
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:27,220
Sis,

479
00:27:27,220 --> 00:27:29,140
This isn't printed as a joke, right?

480
00:27:29,500 --> 00:27:30,820
I'm also not an educated person.

481
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:32,100
This high position, I...

482
00:27:32,380 --> 00:27:32,900
Can't.

483
00:27:32,900 --> 00:27:33,740
Absolutely no way, no way.

484
00:27:33,900 --> 00:27:34,900
I said yes, yes, I can.

485
00:27:41,660 --> 00:27:42,940
Your clothes should also be changed.

486
00:27:43,740 --> 00:27:44,620
All

487
00:27:45,060 --> 00:27:46,180
the car was also replaced.

488
00:27:48,180 --> 00:27:49,380
Sis, that car...

489
00:27:49,660 --> 00:27:50,820
I've given it to Sis Qiang.

490
00:27:50,820 --> 00:27:52,260
If asked to return, maybe...

491
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,540
No problem.

492
00:27:54,540 --> 00:27:55,660
If so, order a new one.

493
00:27:57,100 --> 00:27:57,940
The card given to you before,

494
00:27:57,940 --> 00:27:58,860
have you spent all the money?

495
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:00,180
Together?

496
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,940
Not yet... not finished yet.

497
00:28:02,260 --> 00:28:03,180
If so, just use it first.

498
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,540
In the future, all your salary

499
00:28:04,660 --> 00:28:05,820
I'll transfer it to that card.

500
00:28:08,420 --> 00:28:09,060
An,

501
00:28:09,660 --> 00:28:11,580
take Mr. Meng out to buy some new clothes.

502
00:28:11,860 --> 00:28:12,660
Tomorrow morning,

503
00:28:12,980 --> 00:28:14,580
take him to report to the Investment Department.

504
00:28:14,940 --> 00:28:16,020
Yes, Chairman of the Board of Directors.

505
00:28:19,420 --> 00:28:20,340
What are you laughing at?

506
00:28:21,300 --> 00:28:21,900
Nope.

507
00:28:22,580 --> 00:28:23,500
I'm a little short on oxygen.

508
00:28:23,500 --> 00:28:24,100
Nope.

509
00:28:24,820 --> 00:28:26,140
It feels like a dream.

510
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,500
Sis, you guys aren't plotting to play tricks on me, right?

511
00:28:31,020 --> 00:28:31,780
Go quickly.

512
00:28:34,940 --> 00:28:35,660
Ayo,

513
00:28:36,900 --> 00:28:37,660
Mr. Meng.

514
00:29:02,140 --> 00:29:03,340
You can hear the sound of your laughter

515
00:29:03,980 --> 00:29:05,420
seems to be thinking about something bad.

516
00:29:09,780 --> 00:29:11,700
There are those who don't have good intentions,

517
00:29:12,100 --> 00:29:13,620
So, I didn't think anything good either.

518
00:29:15,580 --> 00:29:16,500
You're so smart,

519
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,980
Aren't you afraid of being silenced?

520
00:29:21,580 --> 00:29:22,420
If I were you,

521
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,940
I will direct it to the Ministry of Finance.

522
00:29:25,420 --> 00:29:26,220
No hassle.

523
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:28,260
Yuan Fenfang was not a fool either.

524
00:29:37,020 --> 00:29:39,060
You're sure he still has a set of transaction journals, right?

525
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:41,180
Certain.

526
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:22,740
(Feng Holding Company)

527
00:31:52,340 --> 00:31:53,100
Mr. Meng,

528
00:31:53,220 --> 00:31:54,060
his surname is Yu,

529
00:31:54,060 --> 00:31:54,900
his name is Yu Hui.

530
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:56,140
Yu Hui?

531
00:31:56,220 --> 00:31:57,020
Hello, hello.

532
00:31:57,180 --> 00:31:57,820
Hello, Mr. Meng.

533
00:31:57,820 --> 00:31:58,460
Halo.

534
00:31:58,980 --> 00:32:00,220
Hello, Mr. Meng. My name is Tian Xin.

535
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:01,660
Tian Xin?

536
00:32:01,700 --> 00:32:02,660
Beautiful woman.

537
00:32:03,420 --> 00:32:04,380
Namaku Li Libao.

538
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,260
Hello, hello.

539
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:06,340
Namaku Zhang Qijia.

540
00:32:06,980 --> 00:32:07,780
Qijia?

541
00:32:07,980 --> 00:32:08,420
Qijia?

542
00:32:08,420 --> 00:32:09,340
Qi from the word entrepreneur?

543
00:32:10,780 --> 00:32:11,660
Namanya Wang Congyi.

544
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:12,900
- Hello, Mr. Meng. - Good name.

545
00:32:12,900 --> 00:32:13,660
Good name.

546
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,060
Her surname is Shu.

547
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:16,140
Namanya Shu Xuechao.

548
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:16,820
Hello, hello.

549
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,380
Hello, Mr. Meng. My name is Shen Ting.

550
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,220
Shen Teng?

551
00:32:19,220 --> 00:32:20,180
- Shen Ting.
- Oh, Shen Ting.

552
00:32:20,180 --> 00:32:21,140
Hello, hello.

553
00:32:21,220 --> 00:32:22,260
I think his name is Shen Teng.

554
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:23,580
Okay.

555
00:32:23,780 --> 00:32:25,420
Everyone already knows each other.

556
00:32:25,780 --> 00:32:26,620
Business units.

557
00:32:26,780 --> 00:32:27,740
I feel this is a good name.

558
00:32:27,740 --> 00:32:29,060
When you look at it, it looks like a place where great work has been done.

559
00:32:29,420 --> 00:32:31,020
From now on we are all one family.

560
00:32:31,860 --> 00:32:33,100
Don't be shy about me.

561
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:34,660
If there's a problem, please look for me.

562
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,620
My room is here.

563
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:36,420
No need to knock on the door.

564
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:37,620
Nothing important can come.

565
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:38,500
Come have tea.

566
00:32:39,980 --> 00:32:41,100
Later, if there is a chance,

567
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:42,500
I'll treat you to eating satay outside.

568
00:32:47,780 --> 00:32:48,660
Mr. Meng's way of speaking

569
00:32:48,660 --> 00:32:49,940
very familial.

570
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,940
Come on, clap.

571
00:33:04,340 --> 00:33:04,900
Mr. Meng,

572
00:33:05,180 --> 00:33:06,100
sudden timing.

573
00:33:06,100 --> 00:33:07,660
Your office is not yet perfectly organized.

574
00:33:08,060 --> 00:33:09,740
If you feel something is missing,

575
00:33:09,780 --> 00:33:11,820
please let me know, I'll arrange it soon.

576
00:33:15,500 --> 00:33:16,380
This is fake, right?

577
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:19,700
Decor.

578
00:33:20,060 --> 00:33:20,860
Decor.

579
00:33:23,820 --> 00:33:24,860
If you don't like it,

580
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,020
I immediately told someone to take it out.

581
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,580
No, no.

582
00:33:26,740 --> 00:33:27,660
I really like.

583
00:33:28,100 --> 00:33:29,020
When I just entered I was shocked.

584
00:33:29,020 --> 00:33:30,220
I thought Mr. Feng gave me a book list.

585
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:32,180
There are so many books, how long do you want to read them?

586
00:33:32,180 --> 00:33:32,660
Good, good.

587
00:33:32,660 --> 00:33:33,380
Let's make it like this.

588
00:33:37,140 --> 00:33:37,820
Secretary An,

589
00:33:37,820 --> 00:33:39,060
What do you think of this arrangement?

590
00:33:41,740 --> 00:33:43,140
The important thing is that Mr. Meng is satisfied.

591
00:33:43,140 --> 00:33:44,180
Satisfied, satisfied.

592
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:46,660
Pak Jia,

593
00:33:47,260 --> 00:33:48,300
before I came,

594
00:33:48,420 --> 00:33:49,940
the chairman of the board of directors has ordered.

595
00:33:50,260 --> 00:33:51,140
He said,

596
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,660
Mr. Meng just joined,

597
00:33:52,980 --> 00:33:54,180
not used to many things.

598
00:33:54,180 --> 00:33:54,780
Correct.

599
00:33:56,220 --> 00:33:57,740
Please guide from Mr. Jia,

600
00:33:58,020 --> 00:34:00,380
to introduce the jobs in the company to Mr. Meng.

601
00:34:00,380 --> 00:34:01,100
Please guide me.

602
00:34:03,010 --> 00:34:04,050
It should be.

603
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,860
Please convey to the chairman of the board of directors,

604
00:34:05,860 --> 00:34:07,530
I will definitely do it.

605
00:34:07,530 --> 00:34:08,530
No need to worry.

606
00:34:10,100 --> 00:34:10,740
Mr. Meng,

607
00:34:11,530 --> 00:34:13,260
What orders do you still have?

608
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:14,420
How dare I order you,

609
00:34:14,420 --> 00:34:15,420
You command me.

610
00:34:15,860 --> 00:34:16,460
No problem.

611
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,570
That... that...

612
00:34:17,570 --> 00:34:18,900
If you have time, come and drink tea.

613
00:34:19,260 --> 00:34:20,260
I don't have anything here either.

614
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:21,940
In that case,

615
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:23,300
I'll go back first.

616
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:24,820
Please, please.

617
00:34:25,700 --> 00:34:26,420
Be careful on the way.

618
00:34:27,260 --> 00:34:28,100
Secretary An, be careful on the road.

619
00:34:28,220 --> 00:34:29,220
Be careful on the road, Secretary An.

620
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:30,380
Be careful.

621
00:34:31,860 --> 00:34:32,700
The people are very friendly.

622
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:33,460
The person is very nice.

623
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,220
Correct.

624
00:34:35,140 --> 00:34:35,740
Mr. Meng,

625
00:34:36,220 --> 00:34:36,970
What if

626
00:34:36,970 --> 00:34:38,570
Do you familiarize yourself with your surroundings first?

627
00:34:39,530 --> 00:34:41,300
Later we will discuss other issues.

628
00:34:41,340 --> 00:34:42,180
What do you think?

629
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,050
Bo... can.

630
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:43,820
I can whenever I can

631
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:44,700
it just depends on you.

632
00:34:45,460 --> 00:34:46,940
If that's the case, I'll take my leave first.

633
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:47,700
Fine.

634
00:34:47,700 --> 00:34:48,140
See you soon.

635
00:34:48,140 --> 00:34:49,140
See you, see you.

636
00:34:49,780 --> 00:34:50,460
Be careful on the way.

637
00:34:51,500 --> 00:34:51,780
See you soon.

638
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:52,780
Don't be too shy.

639
00:34:52,780 --> 00:34:53,540
I'm not feeling well.

640
00:34:54,500 --> 00:34:55,540
See you soon.

641
00:34:56,380 --> 00:34:57,500
Be careful on the road, Manager Jia.

642
00:34:58,460 --> 00:34:59,660
If you're free, come here to play, okay?

643
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,460
Manager Jia...

644
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:09,650
(Business Unit)

645
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:17,260
B... B...

646
00:35:17,900 --> 00:35:19,300
U... business units.

647
00:35:39,420 --> 00:35:40,540
Deputy president.

648
00:36:24,820 --> 00:36:25,580
Coffee.

649
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:55,980
Halo.

650
00:36:56,220 --> 00:36:56,860
Who?

651
00:36:57,460 --> 00:36:58,500
Wu.

652
00:36:59,380 --> 00:37:00,100
Wu?

653
00:37:00,420 --> 00:37:01,620
Where are you calling from?

654
00:37:02,580 --> 00:37:03,340
Take a guess.

655
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:04,220
Already,

656
00:37:04,220 --> 00:37:05,540
don't be curious.

657
00:37:05,540 --> 00:37:06,100
I...

658
00:37:06,220 --> 00:37:07,900
I'm busy here.

659
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:14,340
This is the telephone number of the vice president of the Feng Group's business unit.

660
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:18,220
What are you going there for?

661
00:37:19,620 --> 00:37:20,380
Kak Qiang,

662
00:37:20,380 --> 00:37:21,860
what do you mean I'm here?

663
00:37:22,180 --> 00:37:23,700
From now on, this is my office.

664
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:26,460
This is my office telephone number. Please take note, OK?

665
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:31,100
The vice president of the Feng Group business unit, Mr. Meng, Meng Hui,

666
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:32,900
that's Wu, myself.

667
00:37:34,060 --> 00:37:35,220
Deputy president?

668
00:37:35,860 --> 00:37:36,660
Correct.

669
00:37:37,100 --> 00:37:38,140
Deputy president.

670
00:37:38,860 --> 00:37:39,620
Kak Qiang,

671
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:41,860
Lord Feng also said,

672
00:37:42,380 --> 00:37:43,340
the position of deputy president

673
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:45,220
The goal is for me to adapt first.

674
00:37:45,820 --> 00:37:46,980
After I got to know the business well,

675
00:37:46,980 --> 00:37:48,620
maybe later I will be promoted so...

676
00:37:48,660 --> 00:37:49,420
That...

677
00:37:49,900 --> 00:37:50,940
CEO.

678
00:37:51,140 --> 00:37:52,020
Later I will be a CEO.

679
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:54,220
You're basic,

680
00:37:54,820 --> 00:37:56,220
you are already prosperous apparently.

681
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,140
This little feeling...

682
00:38:03,900 --> 00:38:04,620
Kak Qiang,

683
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:08,220
but to be honest, yeah.

684
00:38:10,380 --> 00:38:12,500
Now I feel like I'm dreaming.

685
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:14,060
You don't know,

686
00:38:14,980 --> 00:38:16,580
just walking inside the building,

687
00:38:16,860 --> 00:38:18,220
white-collar workers passing by,

688
00:38:18,580 --> 00:38:20,220
who wore a suit and was sturdy,

689
00:38:20,420 --> 00:38:21,860
everyone calls me Mr. Meng, Mr. Meng.

690
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:26,540
This greeting really gave me goosebumps all over my body.

691
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,180
You kid,

692
00:38:30,180 --> 00:38:31,980
you are really very lucky.

693
00:38:33,860 --> 00:38:35,220
I'll let you be arrogant for a few days.

694
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:39,220
That's it.

695
00:38:39,220 --> 00:38:40,220
Let's finish it for now, okay?

696
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:42,660
Tonight we meet at Jujinxiao.

697
00:38:42,980 --> 00:38:45,100
Gotta be good at beating you up.

698
00:38:45,380 --> 00:38:46,620
Good, call other friends.

699
00:38:48,860 --> 00:38:49,380
Wait, Sis Qiang.

700
00:38:49,380 --> 00:38:50,340
What are you busy with?

701
00:38:51,100 --> 00:38:52,700
Hasn't second uncle done anything recently?

702
00:38:53,860 --> 00:38:55,340
How would I know what's wrong,

703
00:38:55,340 --> 00:38:56,460
I was asked to come.

704
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,940
However, it's also good.

705
00:38:58,220 --> 00:39:00,020
There is work, which means there is money coming in.

706
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:02,180
I still have to pay the mortgage and support the children.

707
00:39:03,620 --> 00:39:04,700
That's it, that's it, don't talk anymore.

708
00:39:05,100 --> 00:39:05,860
You are busy first.

709
00:39:06,660 --> 00:39:07,220
Good.

710
00:39:07,540 --> 00:39:08,340
See you tonight.

711
00:40:04,620 --> 00:40:05,660
Sis Qiang came.

712
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,100
Has the person arrived?

713
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:07,900
On.

714
00:40:24,180 --> 00:40:24,900
Enter.

715
00:40:25,900 --> 00:40:26,700
Second Uncle.

716
00:40:28,100 --> 00:40:28,700
Sit down quickly.

717
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:29,620
I've been waiting all day.

718
00:40:35,220 --> 00:40:35,900
Oh yes,

719
00:40:36,060 --> 00:40:38,500
do you enter from the front door or the back door?

720
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:39,980
Front door.

721
00:40:41,060 --> 00:40:41,700
Wait.

722
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:44,140
Is someone watching you?

723
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:47,820
No.

724
00:40:50,380 --> 00:40:51,380
Sit down, sit down.

725
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,700
No wonder you've been my man for so many years.

726
00:40:59,820 --> 00:41:01,060
Your job is good.

727
00:41:01,220 --> 00:41:02,060
Reliable.

728
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,500
I didn't contribute much to you either.

729
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,380
This time I'm looking for you

730
00:41:07,820 --> 00:41:09,500
because there is something good that I want to hand over to you.

731
00:41:10,340 --> 00:41:11,180
Second Uncle,

732
00:41:11,700 --> 00:41:13,540
You know I'm scared. I...

733
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:16,060
I can't compare to Brother Jie and Dao Jian.

734
00:41:16,220 --> 00:41:16,900
You're...

735
00:41:17,700 --> 00:41:19,940
not telling you to kill people.

736
00:41:24,580 --> 00:41:26,460
It's just a matter of swiping a matchstick.

737
00:41:26,700 --> 00:41:28,860
Apart from that, absolutely no one knows.

738
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:35,220
Mari.

739
00:41:42,020 --> 00:41:43,220
Actually looking at the current situation...

740
00:41:43,220 --> 00:41:43,700
Here.

741
00:41:43,980 --> 00:41:45,340
...we still have the initiative.

742
00:41:45,940 --> 00:41:47,100
The gold is in our hands.

743
00:41:47,100 --> 00:41:49,180
They can't get this information.

744
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,180
Kapten Xiao.

745
00:41:50,860 --> 00:41:51,540
Coincidentally, we can...

746
00:41:51,540 --> 00:41:53,460
In that case, how about we set a trap?

747
00:41:55,100 --> 00:41:55,980
Good.

748
00:41:59,660 --> 00:42:03,340
In order to track and monitor the further activities of criminal groups,

749
00:42:03,660 --> 00:42:05,140
we hold gold in the sea

750
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:07,220
and deliberately released Ba Lian.

751
00:42:08,340 --> 00:42:09,620
After Ba Lian escaped,

752
00:42:09,700 --> 00:42:10,420
Feng Ruichi

753
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:12,660
fly directly to the Cayman Islands,

754
00:42:13,020 --> 00:42:14,220
then operate the funds.

755
00:42:15,500 --> 00:42:16,420
This is very clear.

756
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,940
Their gold does not come out.

757
00:42:18,220 --> 00:42:20,820
The Feng family was forced to use funds that had escaped previously.

758
00:42:23,380 --> 00:42:24,940
Do you think they are so troublesome?

759
00:42:25,500 --> 00:42:26,540
what are they after?

760
00:42:27,860 --> 00:42:28,860
Aiming for a sense of security.

761
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,220
There is news that says, there is a big man

762
00:42:32,380 --> 00:42:35,180
who was asking Feng Yong for kickbacks.

763
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,500
This Feng Yong is cunning and rotten.

764
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:40,060
At first, he was afraid of getting into trouble,

765
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:42,340
afraid that his secret account will be exposed.

766
00:42:42,620 --> 00:42:43,580
Then, he thought of...

767
00:42:43,580 --> 00:42:45,340
smuggling gold as kickbacks.

768
00:42:48,060 --> 00:42:49,500
In addition, the Feng Group recently

769
00:42:49,540 --> 00:42:51,700
also invested large amounts

770
00:42:51,700 --> 00:42:53,220
in several domestic unicorn companies.

771
00:42:53,580 --> 00:42:56,340
Once some of these companies succeeded in becoming public companies in America,

772
00:42:57,860 --> 00:42:59,580
hence the Feng Group's assets in the country

773
00:42:59,580 --> 00:43:01,700
can be rushed out openly.

774
00:43:11,100 --> 00:43:13,820
Do you know what a unicorn company is?

775
00:43:14,980 --> 00:43:16,660
Does this have anything to do with the Feng Group?

776
00:43:20,460 --> 00:43:21,500
These few years,

777
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,460
The Feng Group successively stopped

778
00:43:24,460 --> 00:43:26,620
current and new projects being built in the country.

779
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:30,140
A large amount of funds flow abroad through foreign investment.

780
00:43:31,540 --> 00:43:33,820
The Supervision Department must have noticed this strange movement.

781
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:35,260
Therefore, at the beginning of this year,

782
00:43:35,820 --> 00:43:37,700
they block the outflow route of funds.

783
00:43:38,300 --> 00:43:40,220
Furthermore, after the third quarter report,

784
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:43,500
The Feng Group invests in dozens of unicorn companies.

785
00:43:43,500 --> 00:43:46,060
The speed and scale are simply abnormal.

786
00:43:46,820 --> 00:43:47,740
Besides, all this

787
00:43:47,740 --> 00:43:49,060
have to wait until next April,

788
00:43:49,580 --> 00:43:50,740
it will only be known to the market.

789
00:43:52,460 --> 00:43:53,580
This time lag

790
00:43:53,780 --> 00:43:54,940
played beautifully.

791
00:44:02,220 --> 00:44:04,700
In that case, the Feng Group invests in so many unicorn companies,

792
00:44:06,460 --> 00:44:07,700
how does the money come out?
