=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:30,620 --> 00:01:32,000
=Episode 5=

3
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,160
Two, three, four.

4
00:01:37,160 --> 00:01:38,720
- Shake your hips. - Why are you so stiff?

5
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:39,950
You taught him.

6
00:01:39,950 --> 00:01:41,480
Two, three.

7
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,950
Walk in style, shake your hips.

8
00:01:43,270 --> 00:01:44,120
(Weizhen Temple) What is that?

9
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:45,950
One two.

10
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:48,800
Stylish.

11
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:52,590
Sorry, sorry.

12
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:53,800
Sorry.

13
00:01:56,040 --> 00:01:56,630
Wu,

14
00:01:57,040 --> 00:01:58,870
Why are you so unpunctual?

15
00:01:58,870 --> 00:02:00,080
Did you secretly take orders

16
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,950
and deliver food again?

17
00:02:00,950 --> 00:02:01,230
No, no, no.

18
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:02,840
Sis, I fell asleep.

19
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,430
Morning, Sis Qiang.

20
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:17,480
Our time is all very valuable.

21
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:18,790
I was wrong, Sis.

22
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:19,510
I'll change it.

23
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:27,640
What's this?

24
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,870
His cell phone rang again.

25
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,280
Do you want to take orders

26
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,040
and continue delivering food again?

27
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:33,120
No, no, no.

28
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:34,200
Message from group.

29
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,480
Your glasses are so worn out,

30
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:40,790
just let it go.

31
00:02:40,790 --> 00:02:41,840
You still love me, huh?

32
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,920
Stop it.

33
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:44,310
Every day you are the one with the most problems.

34
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:45,070
Hurry up.

35
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:45,950
None of your business.

36
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:50,120
Go first.

37
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,430
Next time don't be late again.

38
00:02:52,430 --> 00:02:53,280
Ready, Sis.

39
00:03:00,150 --> 00:03:01,310
At the gambling place

40
00:03:01,310 --> 00:03:03,040
there are bound to be people who win and lose,

41
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:05,310
In gambling places there are good and bad.

42
00:03:05,310 --> 00:03:07,790
There are all kinds of people.

43
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:10,400
For this reason, we must be flexible in socializing,

44
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,920
treating people based on their status.

45
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:13,670
Knowledge here

46
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:14,840
a huge amount.

47
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,000
Fast!

48
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,400
Hurry, hurry!

49
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:19,840
The point is that this is difficult to explain.

50
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:20,950
This is our field

51
00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:21,840
not black,

52
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:23,670
not white either,

53
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:25,400
but grey.

54
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:27,070
No need to fight and kill.

55
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:29,640
Safer than others.

56
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:31,070
Even if you get caught,

57
00:03:31,070 --> 00:03:32,560
there won't be any big problems either.

58
00:03:33,510 --> 00:03:34,560
However,

59
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:36,070
money must be saved.

60
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:37,360
So, the most important position is

61
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,070
the person who looks after the money.

62
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:41,510
As a person who looks after money,

63
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:43,230
you don't need to be able to fight and kill,

64
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,560
but your brain must be fast,

65
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:46,280
true, right?

66
00:03:46,280 --> 00:03:48,400
Your legs also have to be able to run fast.

67
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,120
Plan a little!

68
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,480
Just by running fast,

69
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:51,950
can just take the money out,

70
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:54,360
then you can do your job well.

71
00:04:01,950 --> 00:04:03,400
Hurry up! Hurry up!

72
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,200
Fast!

73
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:07,200
Can't run anymore.

74
00:04:08,510 --> 00:04:09,590
Twenty.

75
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:10,710
Had reached.

76
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:12,560
Kak Qiang,

77
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:13,430
I can't run anymore.

78
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:15,400
Each of you is one round short.

79
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:16,240
Quick, quick, quick.

80
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:16,990
Don't bullshit.

81
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:18,990
- Fast! - I I...

82
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:20,760
Enthusiasm.

83
00:04:33,080 --> 00:04:34,150
This month it's your turn.

84
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,760
The bosses are all here.

85
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:44,990
You Qiang,

86
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:47,200
quickly add money for Mr. Xu.

87
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:48,640
I see it's almost finished.

88
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:50,710
Mr. Xu, how much do you want?

89
00:04:50,710 --> 00:04:51,640
Just tell me the numbers.

90
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,520
Come on, quickly.

91
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:54,040
Add 10 for Mr. Xu.

92
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:56,640
Who chose this run-down place?

93
00:04:56,870 --> 00:04:59,480
Next time you come here, don't look for me.

94
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:01,430
The feng shui is very bad.

95
00:05:01,710 --> 00:05:03,040
What a shame.

96
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,870
My older brother,

97
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:06,960
this is just starting.

98
00:05:06,990 --> 00:05:10,110
This... this is just a small problem like a hair on your body.

99
00:05:11,480 --> 00:05:13,760
Fine, give me 300 thousand.

100
00:05:14,310 --> 00:05:15,430
I'll let you pluck a feather.

101
00:05:15,760 --> 00:05:17,990
Which one you want to remove is up to you.

102
00:05:19,920 --> 00:05:20,640
You see.

103
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:22,310
If so, how dare I?

104
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:23,990
Come on, come on.

105
00:05:24,390 --> 00:05:25,200
Stop it.

106
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:26,080
Come on, come on.

107
00:05:30,480 --> 00:05:31,200
West wind. [*Mahyong pieces]

108
00:05:58,390 --> 00:05:59,110
Eight bamboos. [*Mahjong pieces]

109
00:06:23,830 --> 00:06:25,310
Did I tell you to daydream?

110
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:41,760
Dao Jian,

111
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:44,760
You've scared this kid.

112
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:57,270
If you're looking for death,

113
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,830
don't bring anyone else, okay?

114
00:06:59,310 --> 00:07:01,520
You're afraid Dao Jian won't recognize it's you, huh?

115
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:03,640
Kak Qiang,

116
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:06,080
he kills... kills people.

117
00:07:07,830 --> 00:07:09,520
Even though he killed your ancestors,

118
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:11,270
You also have to pretend as if nothing is wrong.

119
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,390
If you have the guts,

120
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:14,360
go in and kill him right now.

121
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:15,480
If you don't have the guts,

122
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,760
then pretend not to know anything.

123
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:19,040
Understand?

124
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,760
Wu, do you have to be this scared?

125
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:28,640
You just accidentally passed by and happened to catch a glimpse of him.

126
00:07:28,710 --> 00:07:30,110
You also didn't kill that person.

127
00:07:30,710 --> 00:07:31,390
Kak Qiang,

128
00:07:32,760 --> 00:07:34,200
I think I... I don't really fit in

129
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:35,990
is in this field.

130
00:07:36,390 --> 00:07:37,640
Let me go, will you?

131
00:07:38,150 --> 00:07:39,960
I can go back and do whatever else.

132
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,830
I want to go deliver food.

133
00:07:41,830 --> 00:07:42,480
Nonsense!

134
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:47,310
Wu.

135
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:51,520
Listen to me.

136
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,640
It's not that I don't want to let you go,

137
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,240
but if you leave now,

138
00:07:56,310 --> 00:07:57,870
tomorrow someone will cut you off with a knife.

139
00:07:57,870 --> 00:07:58,830
You believe it, don't you?

140
00:07:59,270 --> 00:08:00,760
You just haven't told Dao Jian directly

141
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,710
that you saw him kill people.

142
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:04,390
Could it be that he let you go?

143
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:07,990
Listen to the words of Sister,

144
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:09,430
can't go

145
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:11,150
You can't go either.

146
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:32,510
Today my hands are really unlucky!

147
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:34,190
Today his luck is very good.

148
00:08:34,190 --> 00:08:35,070
Not bad, not bad.

149
00:08:35,510 --> 00:08:36,750
This brother in front is terrible.

150
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:37,590
Go first.

151
00:08:38,920 --> 00:08:40,240
- Come again, yes. - Come again.

152
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:41,800
Be careful on the way.

153
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:45,920
Qiang.

154
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,390
Wu's background is peaceful, right?

155
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,680
It should be safe.

156
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,480
However, I don't know whether he was telling the truth or not.

157
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:06,000
Fine, lend me use it for a moment.

158
00:09:08,680 --> 00:09:09,830
I'll be honest with you,

159
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,830
I was also asked by someone.

160
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:14,750
Don't let second uncle find out.

161
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,630
Lately it's not a lack of people,

162
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:20,270
lend me a moment.

163
00:09:28,270 --> 00:09:29,070
Wu.

164
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:33,000
Brother Qiang, what's wrong?

165
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:34,950
I'm telling you, yeah.

166
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:37,510
Brother Dao Jian has been short of people recently.

167
00:09:37,710 --> 00:09:39,150
You go help him for a few days.

168
00:09:54,360 --> 00:09:55,070
Good.

169
00:09:55,510 --> 00:09:56,880
Excited to the point of being stupid, huh?

170
00:09:57,440 --> 00:09:58,440
I'll tell you, yeah.

171
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,560
You have to be more agile when working with the boss.

172
00:10:01,510 --> 00:10:03,120
Work more, talk less.

173
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,150
If you dare trouble the boss,

174
00:10:05,480 --> 00:10:06,880
I will skin you.

175
00:10:12,270 --> 00:10:13,040
Kak Dao Jian.

176
00:10:13,390 --> 00:10:14,830
Never mind, drive the car.

177
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,120
Liangzi, give him the car keys.

178
00:10:17,150 --> 00:10:18,040
OK, Boss.

179
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,510
I'll just thank you later.

180
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:09,270
Miao Miao.

181
00:11:09,270 --> 00:11:10,000
Sis.

182
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:13,750
Is there anything I need to do?

183
00:11:16,120 --> 00:11:18,560
I've...already sorted everything out.

184
00:11:21,390 --> 00:11:21,880
Sis.

185
00:11:23,750 --> 00:11:24,630
My father is...

186
00:11:25,710 --> 00:11:27,360
It's not just an ordinary car accident, right?

187
00:11:29,630 --> 00:11:31,150
He must have offended someone

188
00:11:31,150 --> 00:11:32,390
because investigating the case...

189
00:11:34,590 --> 00:11:36,150
that's why he was killed.

190
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:43,120
Miao Miao, don't think carelessly.

191
00:11:44,270 --> 00:11:45,270
Study well.

192
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:47,680
We will always be there for you.

193
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:13,010
Turn around, repeat.

194
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,060
Stop.

195
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:21,940
How far is this CCTV from the newsstand?

196
00:12:21,980 --> 00:12:22,770
About 60 meters.

197
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:24,260
This is the only CCTV around here.

198
00:12:24,500 --> 00:12:25,690
Installed by the owner of a shop.

199
00:12:26,210 --> 00:12:28,060
Judging from this person's walking speed,

200
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,740
when he got to the pay phone

201
00:12:29,740 --> 00:12:31,980
around the same time Inspector Chen received the call.

202
00:12:32,690 --> 00:12:34,060
If it comes from this direction,

203
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:34,820
then there is only him.

204
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:37,620
Kapten Xiao.

205
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:38,330
If...

206
00:12:39,450 --> 00:12:40,210
Looking for you.

207
00:12:41,690 --> 00:12:42,450
Let's talk about it later.

208
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:46,770
Halo.

209
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:53,740
Who are you?

210
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,500
You said you witnessed it live?

211
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,210
Don't rush, say it slowly.

212
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:03,500
What really happened?

213
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:05,330
Itu Zhang Zhigao, Dao Jian.

214
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:06,980
He was the one who killed Officer Chen.

215
00:13:08,260 --> 00:13:09,620
I can't tell you my identity.

216
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,010
However, it really was him.

217
00:13:11,010 --> 00:13:12,180
What I said was very accurate.

218
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,820
Clicks enough investigating Dao Jian.

219
00:13:14,130 --> 00:13:15,010
That time he was driving

220
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:15,980
a black car.

221
00:13:17,010 --> 00:13:17,420
Dao Jian.

222
00:13:17,420 --> 00:13:18,450
You guys investigate Dao Jian.

223
00:13:18,450 --> 00:13:19,380
Zhang Zhigao.

224
00:13:24,180 --> 00:13:25,010
Call from where?

225
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:26,380
Small stall on Huarong Street.

226
00:13:26,450 --> 00:13:27,330
Call back.

227
00:13:32,770 --> 00:13:33,570
Halo.

228
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:36,180
Who's calling?

229
00:13:38,260 --> 00:13:39,210
Little boy!

230
00:13:39,450 --> 00:13:41,010
Why are you running?

231
00:13:42,260 --> 00:13:44,740
Hello. As soon as I called him he immediately ran.

232
00:13:45,010 --> 00:13:46,180
What does he look like?

233
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:49,380
Wearing a hat

234
00:13:49,770 --> 00:13:51,380
and masks.

235
00:13:51,890 --> 00:13:53,060
His face was not clear.

236
00:13:53,380 --> 00:13:54,210
His body is not short.

237
00:13:56,210 --> 00:13:57,060
You're welcome, you're welcome.

238
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:08,260
Song Jingzhong.

239
00:14:08,260 --> 00:14:09,260
- Hadir. - Xing Wei.

240
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:10,620
Di mana Xing Wei?

241
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:12,650
Xing Wei menemani Miao Miao.

242
00:14:12,890 --> 00:14:13,500
Call him back.

243
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:13,940
Good.

244
00:14:13,940 --> 00:14:15,260
You two monitor Zhang Zhigao.

245
00:14:15,260 --> 00:14:15,940
Good.

246
00:14:16,570 --> 00:14:17,180
Zhang Peng.

247
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,300
You go to Huarong Street.

248
00:14:19,690 --> 00:14:20,820
Look around this shop

249
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:21,570
is there CCTV or not.

250
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:22,890
Then, around there,

251
00:14:22,890 --> 00:14:23,940
pull all the recordings.

252
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,090
Good.

253
00:14:35,690 --> 00:14:36,500
There's a task.

254
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:38,890
Miao Miao.

255
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:40,330
Kak Zhong.

256
00:14:41,740 --> 00:14:43,420
Sis, you just work first.

257
00:14:44,980 --> 00:14:46,210
Then be careful yourself, okay?

258
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:47,690
If there's a problem, call me, okay?

259
00:14:50,130 --> 00:14:51,180
What is the problem? It's such a rush.

260
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:52,380
Accident problem.

261
00:14:52,380 --> 00:14:54,380
Captain Xiao told us to monitor Dao Jian.

262
00:14:54,770 --> 00:14:55,740
Was he the one who hit it?

263
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,740
Lower your voice.

264
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,090
Paman Xiao.

265
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:15,420
Miao Miao.

266
00:15:16,090 --> 00:15:17,330
Have you finished cleaning up your father's things?

267
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:19,380
Do I need to send someone to take you home?

268
00:15:22,130 --> 00:15:22,980
My father...

269
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,450
was he killed?

270
00:15:31,330 --> 00:15:32,500
Who did you hear from?

271
00:15:32,690 --> 00:15:34,330
You don't need to know who I heard from.

272
00:15:34,450 --> 00:15:35,940
You just say it, is it true or not?

273
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:39,060
Was he killed by someone named Dao Jian?

274
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:43,420
Miao Miao,

275
00:15:44,010 --> 00:15:45,450
you shouldn't be dealing with this.

276
00:15:45,770 --> 00:15:47,130
Listen to me, go home.

277
00:15:47,530 --> 00:15:48,980
Take good care of grandma.

278
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,420
Hello, Bureau Chief Liu.

279
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:55,820
I'm in the office.

280
00:15:56,890 --> 00:15:58,330
OK, I'll be right there.

281
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:01,570
It's just right that I wanted to look for you to report this.

282
00:16:01,740 --> 00:16:02,940
OK, I'll hang up the phone first.

283
00:16:03,500 --> 00:16:04,450
Paman Xiao.

284
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:06,300
Listen to me, come home quickly.

285
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:10,130
Paman Xiao!

286
00:16:21,260 --> 00:16:22,890
Boss, are you looking for me?

287
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,330
There are your men who kill the police.

288
00:16:36,740 --> 00:16:37,450
Come back

289
00:16:37,860 --> 00:16:39,570
and look for this person for me.

290
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:47,940
Kill the police?

291
00:16:48,450 --> 00:16:49,210
Who killed?

292
00:16:49,860 --> 00:16:50,650
Killing who?

293
00:16:52,130 --> 00:16:53,890
Could it be Chen Jinyan?

294
00:16:54,820 --> 00:16:55,570
That's not possible.

295
00:16:55,570 --> 00:16:56,650
They don't have that guts.

296
00:16:57,210 --> 00:16:58,380
Have guts or not,

297
00:16:59,180 --> 00:17:00,690
Basically it's been done.

298
00:17:02,650 --> 00:17:04,020
You investigate carefully.

299
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:05,540
Especially people

300
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:06,540
related to Shen Shijie.

301
00:17:07,170 --> 00:17:08,660
Once you know who did it,

302
00:17:09,450 --> 00:17:11,620
immediately told him to disappear.

303
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:14,740
Why is this linked to Shen Shijie again?

304
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,540
Wasn't he clearly dead long ago?

305
00:17:18,020 --> 00:17:19,170
Do your research.

306
00:17:23,410 --> 00:17:25,980
Take off and throw away the necklace on your neck.

307
00:17:28,450 --> 00:17:30,090
This... this has been blessed by the monk.

308
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:33,330
That's to chain the dog.

309
00:17:46,290 --> 00:17:47,620
Come on, Boss, let's have a toast.

310
00:17:48,210 --> 00:17:49,260
Come on, Boss.

311
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:50,090
I toast you.

312
00:17:50,090 --> 00:17:51,090
Come on, boss.

313
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,170
You eat too.

314
00:17:53,170 --> 00:17:54,050
Don't just stay silent.

315
00:17:54,050 --> 00:17:55,140
I'll keep getting it, come on.

316
00:17:55,140 --> 00:18:00,340
(Mysterious Person)

317
00:18:00,540 --> 00:18:01,210
Come on, come on, come on.

318
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:02,660
Then, I'll get some shrimp for you.

319
00:18:02,980 --> 00:18:03,330
Okay.

320
00:18:03,690 --> 00:18:04,330
Come on, come on, come on.

321
00:18:04,380 --> 00:18:05,260
Everyone drank happily.

322
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Drink happily, yes.

323
00:18:06,810 --> 00:18:07,570
Halo.

324
00:18:10,780 --> 00:18:13,050
Fine, fine, fine. Now do it straight away.

325
00:18:19,410 --> 00:18:20,090
Eat a lot, yes.

326
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:21,660
Spend, spend, spend.

327
00:18:21,660 --> 00:18:22,620
Spend, spend, I spend.

328
00:18:22,620 --> 00:18:23,540
Caring for goldfish, huh?

329
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:25,900
How?

330
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:26,740
Spend, spend.

331
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,090
You, come with me.

332
00:18:28,740 --> 00:18:29,980
The boss chose you.

333
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:31,140
Serve the boss well.

334
00:18:31,330 --> 00:18:32,140
Irritating.

335
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,620
Nice, no?

336
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,810
Great, try it.

337
00:19:24,810 --> 00:19:26,050
OK, the fitting room is here.

338
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:29,980
Please.

339
00:19:38,900 --> 00:19:39,570
How?

340
00:19:45,140 --> 00:19:46,140
That's all.

341
00:21:15,660 --> 00:21:16,410
It doesn't matter.

342
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:17,740
It doesn't matter.

343
00:21:44,410 --> 00:21:47,540
Remembering some truths,

344
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:50,740
then began to reflect again on the meaning of life.

345
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:52,980
Finally realized

346
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,660
My own work is not finished.

347
00:21:56,380 --> 00:21:58,260
People always think very deeply,

348
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:03,090
but the last will be restrained

349
00:22:05,210 --> 00:22:06,140
by his own thoughts.

350
00:22:07,410 --> 00:22:08,410
Restrained.

351
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:12,330
Chains, locks, handcuffs.

352
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:17,410
No need to stick to the literal meaning.

353
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,410
Translate to Chinese.

354
00:22:19,660 --> 00:22:21,260
If said in Mandarin,

355
00:22:22,900 --> 00:22:25,140
confined by his own thoughts.

356
00:22:26,780 --> 00:22:27,660
Appropriate.

357
00:22:28,980 --> 00:22:30,660
Hey, it's you,

358
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,330
let him rest for a while.

359
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,140
Come on, eat an orange.

360
00:22:34,260 --> 00:22:35,140
Thank you, Auntie.

361
00:22:35,860 --> 00:22:36,620
TO,

362
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,410
look how messy this kitchen is.

363
00:22:38,660 --> 00:22:40,020
Young people today

364
00:22:40,330 --> 00:22:41,410
can't do anything.

365
00:22:41,780 --> 00:22:43,780
If there is no helper and food delivery,

366
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,020
I think I will definitely die of starvation.

367
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:47,860
Your aunt really likes to nag.

368
00:22:47,980 --> 00:22:49,140
Just let him be.

369
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:56,540
Have you finished showering?

370
00:22:57,930 --> 00:22:59,260
Where are your dirty clothes?

371
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,620
It's been thrown in the washing machine.

372
00:23:02,410 --> 00:23:03,210
Why do you always

373
00:23:03,210 --> 00:23:04,450
throw everything in the washing machine?

374
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:06,260
It is not machine washable.

375
00:23:06,260 --> 00:23:07,540
Must be washed by hand.

376
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:08,450
Mother.

377
00:23:09,330 --> 00:23:09,930
That's it.

378
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:11,540
I told you that the one who washes is also not clean.

379
00:23:11,540 --> 00:23:12,260
Just me.

380
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:13,330
Bibi.

381
00:23:13,500 --> 00:23:14,210
Just me.

382
00:23:14,690 --> 00:23:15,690
No need, no need.

383
00:23:15,780 --> 00:23:16,690
You sit down quickly.

384
00:23:17,540 --> 00:23:18,780
It'll be over in a moment.

385
00:23:18,780 --> 00:23:19,660
Easy thing.

386
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,380
Mother,

387
00:23:20,900 --> 00:23:22,810
Don't just come to my place and look for work.

388
00:23:23,050 --> 00:23:24,090
I've hired a maid.

389
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,090
Hiring helpers?

390
00:23:26,090 --> 00:23:28,260
The maid's job is to clean the house.

391
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:30,450
How nice would it be to tell him to wash it by hand?

392
00:23:32,620 --> 00:23:33,330
Ying Ying.

393
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,620
Ying Ying,

394
00:23:41,500 --> 00:23:43,140
Don't be annoyed because of your mother's nagging.

395
00:23:43,860 --> 00:23:45,690
If you're his age,

396
00:23:45,930 --> 00:23:48,260
I don't think you'll be any better than him.

397
00:24:02,740 --> 00:24:03,290
Package.

398
00:24:04,410 --> 00:24:05,050
Mine?

399
00:24:05,260 --> 00:24:06,140
Please sign.

400
00:24:12,700 --> 00:24:14,540
(Recipient; Miss Lecturer Ke)

401
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:22,700
(Sender; Feng)

402
00:24:51,330 --> 00:24:52,170
Buy what?

403
00:24:52,380 --> 00:24:53,330
Recipient, Mrs. Lecturer?

404
00:24:55,690 --> 00:24:57,690
Surprise, secret.

405
00:24:59,170 --> 00:25:00,540
What the hell? Very mysterious.

406
00:26:00,260 --> 00:26:00,900
Halo.

407
00:26:02,210 --> 00:26:03,930
Hello, I want to look for Mrs. Lecturer Ke.

408
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,660
What is it?

409
00:26:22,660 --> 00:26:23,290
Telephone.

410
00:26:27,050 --> 00:26:28,170
Hello, who is this?

411
00:26:29,330 --> 00:26:31,090
Don't like the gift I gave?

412
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:33,900
Pak Chen, ya?

413
00:26:34,290 --> 00:26:35,290
What business do you have to look for me?

414
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:37,860
Don't like the model

415
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:39,450
or the color?

416
00:26:40,140 --> 00:26:42,740
How about I exchange it for you?

417
00:26:55,980 --> 00:26:56,860
Mr. Feng,

418
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,380
today my parents are at my house.

419
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:00,260
I beg you...

420
00:27:00,260 --> 00:27:01,780
Your pajamas are adorable.

421
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:19,500
Ying Ying, let me help you dry your hair.

422
00:27:27,090 --> 00:27:28,210
What are you looking for?

423
00:27:33,810 --> 00:27:35,410
What's wrong with him?

424
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,140
Bos.

425
00:28:37,050 --> 00:28:38,410
What you sent is...

426
00:28:38,780 --> 00:28:39,740
Your job is

427
00:28:40,260 --> 00:28:42,410
brought a car to pick up and pick up this woman.

428
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:45,690
Understand.

429
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:47,050
Take care, yes.

430
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:48,690
Watch your mouth well,

431
00:28:48,780 --> 00:28:50,050
don't talk much nonsense.

432
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:52,290
Good.

433
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,900
Make sure he changes his clothes into this.

434
00:29:15,290 --> 00:29:15,930
Students,

435
00:29:16,260 --> 00:29:18,020
today we will discuss about

436
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:20,020
America's tax rate reduction

437
00:29:20,020 --> 00:29:21,090
in early 2018

438
00:29:21,090 --> 00:29:22,570
and the trade war that started

439
00:29:22,570 --> 00:29:23,810
in March 2018.

440
00:29:23,810 --> 00:29:24,780
An increase in interest rates,

441
00:29:24,780 --> 00:29:26,500
reducing tax rates and reducing balance sheets.

442
00:29:26,500 --> 00:29:27,620
We can call it as

443
00:29:27,620 --> 00:29:29,740
three pillars of American economic policy.

444
00:29:30,380 --> 00:29:31,170
Keep raising interest rates

445
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,900
is the most powerful tool for

446
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:34,170
burst the property price bubble.

447
00:29:34,260 --> 00:29:35,090
The effect

448
00:29:35,090 --> 00:29:36,810
just like solving the problem from the root.

449
00:29:37,330 --> 00:29:38,290
balance sheet decline,

450
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:39,740
in fact the effect is similar to

451
00:29:39,740 --> 00:29:40,570
increase in interest rates.

452
00:29:41,210 --> 00:29:41,930
In China,

453
00:29:42,170 --> 00:29:44,210
the most direct impact is property prices.

454
00:29:44,860 --> 00:29:47,140
A reduction in tax rates will instead

455
00:29:47,140 --> 00:29:48,860
pressure the yuan to fall.

456
00:29:49,570 --> 00:29:50,860
OK, now the problem arises.

457
00:29:51,210 --> 00:29:52,500
What should we do?

458
00:29:52,810 --> 00:29:54,020
It should lower property prices.

459
00:29:54,020 --> 00:29:55,450
That's right, it should reduce property prices.

460
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:57,290
If property prices continue to rise,

461
00:29:57,290 --> 00:29:58,810
it will lead to yuan depreciation,

462
00:29:58,810 --> 00:30:00,290
there will be more funds flowing out.

463
00:30:03,020 --> 00:30:05,330
Guaranteeing large-scale foreign loans in 2005-2006

464
00:30:05,330 --> 00:30:06,090
divert funds,

465
00:30:06,090 --> 00:30:07,860
causing the stock market to fall and the exchange rate to drop,

466
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,900
the consequences are fatal.

467
00:30:08,900 --> 00:30:09,860
The government will definitely do more

468
00:30:09,860 --> 00:30:11,210
control foreign investment.

469
00:30:12,450 --> 00:30:13,540
To be more precise, it is

470
00:30:13,540 --> 00:30:15,020
the government controls more tightly

471
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:16,860
investment in foreign assets

472
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,930
which is not supported by the state.

473
00:30:21,090 --> 00:30:22,450
Actually, talking about anything is useless.

474
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:23,860
In the 80s,

475
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:25,780
US president, Reagan, lowered tax rates significantly.

476
00:30:25,780 --> 00:30:26,900
It makes the Japanese economy

477
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:27,900
so go back 20 years,

478
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:29,450
even made the Soviet Union break up.

479
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,290
So, this time Trump lowered tax rates,

480
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,170
(Exit) the most affected

481
00:30:32,170 --> 00:30:32,690
still us.

482
00:30:32,690 --> 00:30:33,660
- Correct. - Correct

483
00:30:39,060 --> 00:30:39,420
(Exit)

484
00:30:39,420 --> 00:30:41,420
(Quick)

485
00:30:49,210 --> 00:30:49,860
Good.

486
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:52,980
Then this question

487
00:30:52,980 --> 00:30:54,050
will be

488
00:30:54,050 --> 00:30:55,090
today's class quiz.

489
00:30:55,780 --> 00:30:57,500
- Seriously. - Seriously.

490
00:30:57,860 --> 00:30:58,690
Next, you guys

491
00:30:58,690 --> 00:30:59,780
express your own views.

492
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:01,860
The number of words is not less than 2000.

493
00:31:02,170 --> 00:31:04,050
After class, gather at Yu Chengbo,

494
00:31:04,260 --> 00:31:05,210
then, take it to my office.

495
00:31:06,020 --> 00:31:07,020
Everyone get started.

496
00:31:10,210 --> 00:31:10,690
Here.

497
00:31:15,050 --> 00:31:15,660
How to write it?

498
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:16,620
Teach me.

499
00:31:16,620 --> 00:31:17,290
Can't.

500
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:20,500
I have urgent business, I have to go out.

501
00:31:20,620 --> 00:31:22,050
You help me maintain class order.

502
00:31:23,140 --> 00:31:24,210
Do you need help?

503
00:31:26,210 --> 00:31:28,860
(If you don't fight, it won't hurt.)

504
00:31:29,860 --> 00:31:31,050
No need, thanks.

505
00:32:40,450 --> 00:32:41,140
Halo.

506
00:32:42,090 --> 00:32:43,140
The item is in the bag.

507
00:32:43,780 --> 00:32:44,810
Try opening it and taking a look.

508
00:32:58,210 --> 00:32:59,900
You should already know what to do, right?

509
00:33:00,450 --> 00:33:01,540
I'm still in the car.

510
00:33:18,780 --> 00:33:19,690
Move the car over.

511
00:33:23,450 --> 00:33:24,330
You're down.

512
00:36:34,500 --> 00:36:35,740
Take off the jacket.

513
00:36:38,610 --> 00:36:40,980
I want you to take off the jacket.

514
00:37:20,690 --> 00:37:22,980
Well, call the person in.

515
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:28,210
Fine.

516
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,020
What about this girl?

517
00:38:01,210 --> 00:38:04,980
He wakes up before 07:00.

518
00:38:05,620 --> 00:38:06,500
(Read and Answer)

519
00:38:06,610 --> 00:38:10,500
Then wash your hands and face quickly.

520
00:38:11,450 --> 00:38:13,300
He arrived at school early.

521
00:38:17,020 --> 00:38:17,980
Arrive soon.

522
00:38:18,170 --> 00:38:19,820
These have been carefully selected for you.

523
00:38:19,820 --> 00:38:20,690
You will definitely be satisfied.

524
00:38:20,690 --> 00:38:21,210
Bos.

525
00:38:22,020 --> 00:38:22,650
Good.

526
00:38:25,370 --> 00:38:25,930
Mr. Zhang.

527
00:38:25,980 --> 00:38:26,890
Come on, come in.

528
00:38:52,740 --> 00:38:54,100
Halo, Rade, River.

529
00:39:03,660 --> 00:39:06,620
(No Entry)

530
00:39:12,410 --> 00:39:13,500
Halo, Rade, River.

531
00:39:16,370 --> 00:39:18,370
He didn't ask me to do any secret tasks.

532
00:39:19,540 --> 00:39:21,540
The point is to pick up and pick up a girl.

533
00:39:21,540 --> 00:39:22,210
Wu,

534
00:39:22,930 --> 00:39:25,410
do you know who Dao Jian killed that day?

535
00:39:27,210 --> 00:39:27,980
Don't know.

536
00:39:29,820 --> 00:39:30,780
Who?

537
00:39:35,850 --> 00:39:36,740
Police.

538
00:39:37,170 --> 00:39:38,890
Deputy captain of the Criminal Police Team.

539
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,020
Dao Jian rupanya

540
00:39:45,020 --> 00:39:46,820
colluding with the police.

541
00:39:47,650 --> 00:39:49,610
I wonder who betrayed Sis Jie?

542
00:39:49,610 --> 00:39:50,690
apparently that's him.

543
00:39:53,930 --> 00:39:55,690
Wu, you're still listening, aren't you?

544
00:39:57,500 --> 00:39:58,610
Ya, Kak Qiang.

545
00:39:59,410 --> 00:40:00,170
I'm telling you,

546
00:40:00,170 --> 00:40:01,340
Dao Jian called you there

547
00:40:01,340 --> 00:40:02,610
because I want to test you.

548
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:04,500
He must still suspect that

549
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:06,260
You saw him kill the cop.

550
00:40:06,260 --> 00:40:07,260
Got it, right?

551
00:40:07,340 --> 00:40:08,170
Don't let that kid

552
00:40:08,170 --> 00:40:10,340
even come back to bite us later.

553
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:12,410
Understand?

554
00:40:15,410 --> 00:40:16,210
I already know.

555
00:40:17,260 --> 00:40:18,100
Stay cool.

556
00:40:24,820 --> 00:40:25,980
Sis, that's...

557
00:40:26,260 --> 00:40:27,300
I'm menstruating,

558
00:40:27,740 --> 00:40:28,690
I want to relax for a while.

559
00:40:29,610 --> 00:40:31,170
Please don't tell anyone.

560
00:40:31,780 --> 00:40:32,650
Thank you, Sis.

561
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:54,540
(No entry)

562
00:41:03,930 --> 00:41:05,340
Boss, what's wrong?

563
00:41:05,690 --> 00:41:06,450
Got a problem?

564
00:41:07,500 --> 00:41:08,980
Weren't you asked to stand guard at the door?

565
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:10,740
Where did you run off to?

566
00:41:10,890 --> 00:41:13,020
Boss, I have a stomach ache.

567
00:41:13,540 --> 00:41:14,500
I went to the toilet.

568
00:41:19,020 --> 00:41:19,980
Take the girl away.

569
00:41:24,540 --> 00:41:25,410
What do you guys see?

570
00:41:25,610 --> 00:41:26,610
Work!

571
00:41:57,370 --> 00:41:57,780
That...

572
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:01,370
you're fine, right?

573
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:05,650
Go away.

574
00:42:06,850 --> 00:42:07,650
Go away.

575
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:10,930
Be careful.

576
00:42:16,610 --> 00:42:18,780
Miss Ke. Miss Ke.

577
00:42:31,820 --> 00:42:37,380
(Emergency Installation)

578
00:42:57,740 --> 00:42:58,780
Dokter Zhang, ya?

579
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:02,370
How is he now?

580
00:43:05,100 --> 00:43:06,060
Now this...

581
00:43:06,300 --> 00:43:08,300
the patient was hit in the head,

582
00:43:08,410 --> 00:43:10,370
chest, back, hands and feet.

583
00:43:10,580 --> 00:43:12,410
There was a lot of bleeding all over his body.

584
00:43:13,170 --> 00:43:14,930
Apart from that, during the inspection,

585
00:43:15,130 --> 00:43:16,170
The patient is still vomiting blood

586
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:17,500
and dizzy.

587
00:43:18,450 --> 00:43:19,650
Now it's still not certain

588
00:43:19,890 --> 00:43:20,930
head injury,

589
00:43:21,130 --> 00:43:22,850
or on internal organs.

590
00:43:24,060 --> 00:43:25,540
Patients need to be hospitalized for observation for some time.

591
00:43:26,020 --> 00:43:27,780
What is your relationship with the patient?

592
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:29,370
We are good friends.

593
00:43:30,370 --> 00:43:31,610
How could he be injured?

594
00:43:32,650 --> 00:43:34,410
He was robbed.

595
00:43:34,580 --> 00:43:35,580
