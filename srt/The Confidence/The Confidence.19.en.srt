00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:32,380
=Episode 19=

3
00:01:33,740 --> 00:01:35,780
Don't play these little tricks with me.

4
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:37,570
I don't like.

5
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:53,780
I certainly understand.

6
00:01:54,340 --> 00:01:56,060
Now I'm in your hands.

7
00:01:59,060 --> 00:02:01,170
My life and death are at the snap of your finger.

8
00:02:02,780 --> 00:02:03,930
It's good that you understand.

9
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,460
However,

10
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,140
I can help you seriously,

11
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,140
and can also harm you, you believe it, don't you?

12
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:13,860
Why?

13
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:15,700
Want to negotiate terms with me again?

14
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,780
Where do I have the right to negotiate terms with you?

15
00:02:19,420 --> 00:02:21,250
Just want to fight for a little profit for myself.

16
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,860
Really.

17
00:02:26,060 --> 00:02:27,090
I've accepted my fate.

18
00:02:29,170 --> 00:02:30,090
Don't hate me anymore?

19
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:32,170
Hate it.

20
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:36,220
Really wants to cut you to death.

21
00:02:38,170 --> 00:02:39,450
However, what's the point?

22
00:02:39,940 --> 00:02:41,170
I can't win against you either.

23
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:44,090
Not having enough strength and being helpless.

24
00:02:44,090 --> 00:02:45,650
There are too many things to worry about.

25
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,140
I can only accept fate,

26
00:02:48,890 --> 00:02:51,780
take advantage of the situation to make my life more comfortable.

27
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:18,450
I will try my best to help you,

28
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,300
but I have two conditions.

29
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,810
The first one.

30
00:03:24,580 --> 00:03:26,060
You have to trust me completely.

31
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,940
You let me reach my goals,

32
00:03:27,940 --> 00:03:28,810
then I believe you.

33
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:30,580
No problem.

34
00:03:31,220 --> 00:03:32,450
I have to enter the company,

35
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:34,860
understand all financial and project records.

36
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:36,450
This way, I just know where to act.

37
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:38,890
How much money can you get for me?

38
00:03:40,450 --> 00:03:42,170
It depends on how much you trust me.

39
00:03:43,250 --> 00:03:44,170
The second one.

40
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,810
Wu.

41
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:42,620
Go up.

42
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:44,900
Good.

43
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:26,570
Mr. Feng,

44
00:05:26,780 --> 00:05:28,130
What's the matter? You asked me here?

45
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:37,500
Sit down first.

46
00:05:44,740 --> 00:05:45,780
I've brought the person for you.

47
00:05:46,690 --> 00:05:47,850
Just calm your anger.

48
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:01,130
Mr. Feng.

49
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:02,530
Tuan...

50
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:09,060
Sis Wu.

51
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,290
Don't, don't.

52
00:06:10,290 --> 00:06:12,570
Wu, just call me Wu.

53
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,290
Then, do you want to know...

54
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:31,530
how does it feel to have a finger cut by someone?

55
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:32,940
Miss Ke,

56
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:34,660
You have to calm down a bit.

57
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:35,740
I...

58
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:37,810
At that time I just went there.

59
00:06:37,810 --> 00:06:39,570
You have also seen, Leng Tou did it.

60
00:06:40,020 --> 00:06:41,250
You calm down a bit, Miss Ke.

61
00:06:41,340 --> 00:06:42,410
Now we are adults.

62
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,810
Miss Ke, you listen to me.

63
00:07:08,740 --> 00:07:10,060
It's been difficult for you, friend.

64
00:07:14,690 --> 00:07:15,900
The password is on the back of the card,

65
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:18,530
check into the hospital.

66
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,620
Drink it.

67
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:24,690
How did you become Feng Xiaosheng?

68
00:08:33,490 --> 00:08:34,730
Forget it if you don't want to say it,

69
00:08:34,730 --> 00:08:36,050
it's your secret.

70
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,130
I am Feng Xiaosheng.

71
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:51,250
You're not.

72
00:08:56,490 --> 00:08:58,900
Perbedaan antara Shen Shijie dan Feng Xiaosheng

73
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:02,250
is the difference between wolves and dogs.

74
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,810
Wolves and dogs?

75
00:09:08,170 --> 00:09:09,420
Your current self

76
00:09:11,980 --> 00:09:14,460
just like a wolf being skinned,

77
00:09:16,250 --> 00:09:18,930
then packed alive in a dog's skin.

78
00:09:22,730 --> 00:09:23,610
If it's not a wolf, it's a dog,

79
00:09:23,690 --> 00:09:24,570
you're cursing me, aren't you?

80
00:09:25,340 --> 00:09:26,420
It is true.

81
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,300
You're a beast.

82
00:09:37,460 --> 00:09:39,610
I don't want to be what Feng Xiaosheng is at all.

83
00:09:43,980 --> 00:09:45,780
I hate this other person's face.

84
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:13,610
(That time I jumped into the abyss,)

85
00:10:14,610 --> 00:10:16,340
(the plan is very carefully laid out.)

86
00:10:17,540 --> 00:10:21,340
(They prepared a safety air cushion and a corpse for me.)

87
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:23,610
(In the cave,)

88
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:24,730
(also deliberately left)

89
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:26,460
(fingerprints and hair from a corpse.)

90
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,460
(When I come to my senses,)

91
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:34,540
(at first I had absolutely no idea where I was.)

92
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,980
(I even suspected that I was in hell.)

93
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:14,860
(After crossing the ocean,)

94
00:11:14,860 --> 00:11:17,340
(I came to an old castle in Spain,)

95
00:11:18,220 --> 00:11:19,930
(I finally see the light again.)

96
00:11:23,570 --> 00:11:24,570
(There,)

97
00:11:25,690 --> 00:11:28,780
(I met Feng Xiaosheng who was incurable.)

98
00:11:31,930 --> 00:11:33,930
(Feng Xiaosheng shows me some documents,)

99
00:11:34,810 --> 00:11:38,930
(told me his father, is also my biological father.)

100
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,460
(Nanzhou City Loushan Village Orphanage)

101
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:43,340
(Feng Xiaosheng told me a crazy plan.)

102
00:11:44,130 --> 00:11:46,610
(This plan completely changes)

103
00:11:46,610 --> 00:11:48,690
(my fate and many others.)

104
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,780
(This secret)

105
00:11:51,780 --> 00:11:54,050
(never tell anyone forever.)

106
00:11:54,860 --> 00:11:59,860
(I hope you will always remember what I said to you.)

107
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:02,900
(Remember,)

108
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,170
(when returning to Nanzhou,)

109
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,900
(never let anyone see your flaws.)

110
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,460
(I'll say goodbye first,)

111
00:12:15,130 --> 00:12:16,370
(Brother.)

112
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,220
So, you came back with someone else's identity?

113
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:40,780
I've told you all this,

114
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,860
you can report to the police,

115
00:12:42,860 --> 00:12:44,540
as long as the police investigate carefully,

116
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:46,170
they will definitely be able to find out my identity.

117
00:12:58,860 --> 00:13:00,220
Actually you know,

118
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,100
whatever I say doesn't matter, right?

119
00:13:06,370 --> 00:13:09,300
Because you don't have any proof to show.

120
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,250
Proof?

121
00:13:16,050 --> 00:13:17,490
Can I have another glass?

122
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:33,930
However, Officer Chen told me,

123
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:38,540
Shen Shijie's corpse was found at that time,

124
00:13:38,690 --> 00:13:40,130
DNA comparison has been carried out,

125
00:13:41,370 --> 00:13:43,660
the person who died was Shen Shijie himself.

126
00:13:50,170 --> 00:13:52,020
This meticulous plan,

127
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,810
how could you let them

128
00:13:53,810 --> 00:13:55,420
find the gap easily?

129
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:04,460
You really really want to know?

130
00:14:10,610 --> 00:14:11,730
Not really curious,

131
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:14,930
but I'm a little curious.

132
00:14:26,370 --> 00:14:27,300
I...

133
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,860
won't tell you.

134
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,100
However, just thinking about it, you already know,

135
00:14:47,730 --> 00:14:49,100
nothing more than a

136
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,780
Another replacement trick.

137
00:15:00,130 --> 00:15:01,130
Mr. Feng,

138
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:05,370
It is not enough for humans to just have a piece of skin.

139
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,050
Study well.

140
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:10,780
Treat me better.

141
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:13,050
I can teach you slowly.

142
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,340
Maybe someday,

143
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,540
I can really help you get a PhD.

144

(Incoming Call; Leng Tou)

145
00:16:03,300 --> 00:16:03,930

Who turned off the lights?

Who turned off the lights?

162

Call the manager, call the manager!

Don't move! Don't move!

169
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:26,700
Do not move! Everyone squat!

170
00:17:28,370 --> 00:17:29,490
Why arrest me?

00:17:37,660 --> 00:17:38,900
terrible, terrible.

177
00:17:38,900 --> 00:17:39,660
our brothers,

178
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:41,850
this time maybe everyone will be caught by the police.

179
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,780
What's wrong, Brother Qiang?

180
00:17:50,660 --> 00:17:51,700
Why did you come?

181
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,660
It's not that Leng Tou called, he said there was a big thing,

182
00:17:53,660 --> 00:17:54,580
even told me to wear formal clothes.

183
00:17:54,580 --> 00:17:55,540
Why are your clothes...

184
00:17:56,210 --> 00:17:57,660
Why are there so many police?

185
00:17:57,970 --> 00:17:59,180
Where's the big thing?

186
00:17:59,180 --> 00:18:00,580

to celebrate his birthday.

189
00:18:02,780 --> 00:18:03,940
Isn't this person stupid?

190
00:18:05,420 --> 00:18:06,330
Hello, Second Uncle.

191
00:18:06,660 --> 00:18:08,730
Second Uncle, I'm not calling you names.

192
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:10,850
How dare I insult you, Second Uncle.

193
00:18:11,730 --> 00:18:12,250
Nope.

194
00:18:12,660 --> 00:18:13,180
Nope.

195
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,660
Wait,

196
00:18:19,660 --> 00:18:20,850
what do you say?

197
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:21,940
Run.

198
00:18:25,300 --> 00:18:26,130
Kak Qiang.

199
00:18:27,490 --> 00:18:28,300
Hurry up.

200
00:18:29,090 --> 00:18:29,940
Ayo.

201
00:18:32,060 --> 00:18:33,060
What are you two doing?

202
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:34,130
Run!

203
00:18:36,330 --> 00:18:37,580
You guys, chase.

204
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:44,450
Hurry, hurry.

205
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:45,820
Hurry, hurry, it's okay.

206
00:18:45,820 --> 00:18:46,420
Hurry, hurry.

207
00:18:46,450 --> 00:18:47,450
It's okay, it's okay.

208
00:18:50,090 --> 00:18:50,420
Kak Qiang,

209
00:18:50,420 --> 00:18:51,210
say, what is this?

210
00:18:53,020 --> 00:18:54,940
There must be spies.

211
00:18:54,940 --> 00:18:55,900
Are there spies?

212
00:18:58,610 --> 00:18:59,420
Impossible, right?

213
00:19:11,700 --> 00:19:12,210
Road.

214
00:19:49,180 --> 00:19:49,850
Kak Qiang,

215
00:19:49,940 --> 00:19:51,180
second uncle is upstairs.

216
00:19:59,380 --> 00:20:01,380
(On time)

217
00:20:11,580 --> 00:20:12,700
A moment.

218
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:18,540
(On time)

219
00:20:18,540 --> 00:20:19,210
Kan's sister

220
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:20,060
Kan's sister

221
00:20:20,180 --> 00:20:21,210
Sis Qiang has come.

222
00:20:22,580 --> 00:20:24,580
The people inside have been waiting for you for a long time.

223
00:20:29,060 --> 00:20:29,940
Second Uncle.

224
00:20:37,940 --> 00:20:39,660
Who's making trouble again?

225
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:44,130
The situation recently is very bad,

226
00:20:44,660 --> 00:20:46,450
all friends are very careful,

227
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:48,660
no one dared to cause trouble.

228
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:50,660
Then, why was everyone arrested?

229
00:20:57,700 --> 00:20:58,850
Only you two managed to escape?

230
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,370
Only the two of us managed to escape.

231
00:21:03,850 --> 00:21:05,420
If it arrives one step earlier,

232
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:08,210
both of us will also be arrested by the police.

233
00:21:09,300 --> 00:21:11,180
Some of those fools,

234
00:21:11,370 --> 00:21:12,540
I've obviously found out lately

235
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:13,820
currently eradicating the mafia.

236
00:21:13,820 --> 00:21:14,820
Get together, yeah, just get together,

237
00:21:14,820 --> 00:21:16,900
even still matching the costumes.

238
00:21:18,780 --> 00:21:21,820
I arrived late because of traffic jam on the road.

239
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:22,850
If he,

240
00:21:22,850 --> 00:21:25,330
because he wanted to wait for me to come in together.

241
00:21:25,330 --> 00:21:27,130
So, both of us...

242
00:21:27,900 --> 00:21:29,420
Wu, said hello to second uncle.

243
00:21:31,450 --> 00:21:32,210
Second Uncle.

244
00:21:34,490 --> 00:21:36,850
You're the one who drives for Sheng, right?

245
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:38,850
Yes, me.

246
00:21:43,780 --> 00:21:44,660
Previously,

247
00:21:44,660 --> 00:21:46,700
he's the guy who keeps the money with me.

248
00:21:47,210 --> 00:21:47,900
A few days ago,

249
00:21:47,900 --> 00:21:49,090
Mr. Feng likes it,

250
00:21:49,330 --> 00:21:51,180
So, go there to drive it.

251
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,610
Second Uncle, don't worry.

252
00:21:52,700 --> 00:21:54,780
The person must be trustworthy.

253
00:22:03,370 --> 00:22:06,660
Your hand... is injured?

254
00:22:10,850 --> 00:22:11,700
Of.

255
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,210
When did it hurt?

256
00:22:16,180 --> 00:22:18,210
To... yesterday.

257
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:21,820
How could it be injured?

258
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:23,900
Why didn't I hear you say it?

259
00:22:25,330 --> 00:22:26,700
Sis Qiang, this...

260
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:36,210
Kak Qiang.

261
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:38,940
What's wrong, Brother Qiang?

262
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:46,450
Kak Qiang.

263
00:22:48,370 --> 00:22:49,300
Second Uncle.

264
00:22:51,660 --> 00:22:52,370
Second Uncle.

265
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:53,900
Nope.

266
00:22:55,580 --> 00:22:56,180
Kak Qiang!

267
00:22:56,780 --> 00:22:57,700
Sick, Sister Qiang.

268
00:22:58,700 --> 00:23:00,090
Second Uncle. Second Uncle!

269
00:23:12,130 --> 00:23:13,900
Why are your injuries so serious?

270
00:23:17,780 --> 00:23:19,300
I drank too much last night,

271
00:23:19,300 --> 00:23:20,660
then fell on the way home.

272
00:23:23,850 --> 00:23:25,180
Blame it on me, damn it

273
00:23:25,820 --> 00:23:26,700
fell in the wrong place,

274
00:23:26,700 --> 00:23:30,020
there was a nail there and it pierced me straight away.

275
00:23:30,780 --> 00:23:32,090
Have you had a tetanus shot?

276
00:23:33,090 --> 00:23:33,700
Already.

277
00:23:38,730 --> 00:23:40,130
Just focus on chatting.

278
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:41,820
Hurry up, sit down.

279
00:23:43,540 --> 00:23:44,300
Sit down.

280
00:23:44,580 --> 00:23:45,330
Good.

281
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:46,210
Have a glass of wine

282
00:23:46,210 --> 00:23:47,580
to relieve your stress.

283
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,820
Come on, I'll pour it out for you.

284
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:52,700
Let me do it.

285
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:54,180
Second Uncle, let me do it.

286
00:23:57,490 --> 00:23:58,850
Brother Qiang, can't drink, can't drink.

287
00:23:58,850 --> 00:23:59,850
I took antibiotics.

288
00:23:59,850 --> 00:24:01,490
Oh, yeah, his hand was injured.

289
00:24:02,850 --> 00:24:04,130
Then, I'll drink with you.

290
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,130
You bastard.

291
00:24:09,490 --> 00:24:10,540
Can't you sit well?

292
00:24:10,540 --> 00:24:11,730
Put the buttons on your clothes.

293
00:24:16,060 --> 00:24:17,820
You guys still dare to get together to gamble?

294
00:24:19,660 --> 00:24:20,850
Think carefully about what to say next.

295
00:24:23,090 --> 00:24:24,060
Kapten Xiao,

296
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,020
we arrested 17 people,

297
00:24:26,020 --> 00:24:27,250
but didn't catch

298
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:29,700
You Qiang and that person named Wu.

299
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,900
I understand.

300
00:24:31,250 --> 00:24:32,020
Xing Wei,

301
00:24:32,450 --> 00:24:35,580
you go check their gambling amount,

302
00:24:35,780 --> 00:24:36,780
don't make mistakes.

303
00:24:37,130 --> 00:24:38,060
Good.

304
00:24:43,060 --> 00:24:44,370
Will this trick work, Captain Xiao?

305
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,020
We will see.

306
00:24:53,450 --> 00:24:55,020
You don't need to deliver, you don't need to deliver.

307
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,580
Don't do that, Sister Qiang.

308
00:24:57,580 --> 00:24:59,250
I'll take you two.

309
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,970
Sis Kan, how dare you trouble Sis Kan to accompany us.

310
00:25:02,970 --> 00:25:04,730
Look at your words.

311
00:25:04,730 --> 00:25:05,820
Too shy.

312
00:25:06,060 --> 00:25:07,780
We are old acquaintances,

313
00:25:07,900 --> 00:25:09,900
In the future, I will still have to rely on you, Brother Qiang,

314
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,330
to keep taking care of me

315
00:25:11,330 --> 00:25:13,060
Sis Kan, look at your words.

316
00:25:13,060 --> 00:25:14,820
If there is any problem here, just one word,

317
00:25:14,820 --> 00:25:16,250
I'll come soon.

318
00:25:16,820 --> 00:25:18,780
You don't need to accompany us, we'll go first.

319
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:21,450
You guys be careful on the road.

320
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:33,210
Wu.

321
00:25:38,060 --> 00:25:38,820
Good, yeah.

322
00:25:39,180 --> 00:25:40,660
You even dared to trick me, huh.

323
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,490
Cheating what?

324
00:25:41,490 --> 00:25:43,180
Am I cheating to get your money or your body?

325
00:25:43,540 --> 00:25:44,820
Look at your words.

326
00:25:47,330 --> 00:25:48,450
Brother Qiang, my hand...

327
00:25:48,730 --> 00:25:49,820
What are you doing?

328
00:25:50,450 --> 00:25:52,330
Tell me, what really happened to that wound?

329
00:25:52,660 --> 00:25:53,610
What happened?

330
00:25:53,610 --> 00:25:54,970
Didn't I tell you earlier?

331
00:25:55,090 --> 00:25:56,490
I drank too much last night,

332
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:58,020
then got stabbed when it fell where there were spikes.

333
00:26:00,290 --> 00:26:02,370
Can we stop talking nonsense?

334
00:26:04,010 --> 00:26:04,650
What are your nails

335
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,650
can you make a hole that big?

336
00:26:06,060 --> 00:26:06,890
When you fall,

337
00:26:06,890 --> 00:26:08,370
the back of your hand touches the floor first?

338
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:11,220
Just now in front of second uncle,

339
00:26:11,490 --> 00:26:12,700
I didn't blow your cover, right?

340
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,740
Are you still not loyal enough friend?

341
00:26:14,980 --> 00:26:16,860
If you hide it from me too,

342
00:26:17,650 --> 00:26:18,290
I tell you,

343
00:26:18,290 --> 00:26:19,980
Don't blame me for not caring about you anymore!

344
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:23,170
Great too, yes, Kak Qiang.

345
00:26:26,530 --> 00:26:27,650
Can realize it.

346
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,580
Okay.

347
00:26:31,820 --> 00:26:32,490
This.

348
00:26:35,130 --> 00:26:37,100
You are very careful, yes.

349
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:40,290
What are you doing?

350
00:26:40,290 --> 00:26:41,700
No need to do this useless thing.

351
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:43,130
Tell me, what's the matter?

352
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:45,060
Kak Qiang,

353
00:26:45,060 --> 00:26:46,860
I really don't want to keep secrets from you, or anything.

354
00:26:47,860 --> 00:26:49,220
I can't say.

355
00:26:49,220 --> 00:26:51,410
Saying it to anyone, it's like I'm secretly complaining.

356
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:53,250
Don't ask again.

357
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,010
So what if you told me?

358
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:00,370
Who can I tell?

359
00:27:00,370 --> 00:27:01,740
This problem got to me, didn't it...

360
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:02,860
Ke Ying!

361
00:27:04,010 --> 00:27:05,130
It was Miss Ke who stabbed him.

362
00:27:05,860 --> 00:27:06,740
Miss Ke?

363
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:07,620
According to you, this is the problem

364
00:27:07,620 --> 00:27:08,700
who should I complain to?

365
00:27:09,650 --> 00:27:10,860
He suddenly picked up a pen,

366
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:12,340
this long, this big,

367
00:27:12,340 --> 00:27:13,820
directly thrust it at me.

368
00:27:14,130 --> 00:27:15,220
Cruel, really.

369
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,940
It hurt so much that I almost died.

370
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:21,010
What about Mr. Feng?

371
00:27:21,010 --> 00:27:22,490
Master Feng should be there.

372
00:27:22,700 --> 00:27:23,620
Doesn't he care?

373
00:27:23,620 --> 00:27:24,490
Care?

374
00:27:25,170 --> 00:27:26,620
He's the one who took me there,

375
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:28,170
watched Miss Ke stab me.

376
00:27:28,460 --> 00:27:29,340
Not hindered at all,

377
00:27:29,340 --> 00:27:30,290
just standing there,

378
00:27:30,290 --> 00:27:31,170
strike a pose.

379
00:27:31,170 --> 00:27:33,650
Do you think this constitutes complaining?

380
00:27:34,010 --> 00:27:35,250
What is this problem?

381
00:27:35,250 --> 00:27:36,820
Is there a boss like him?

382
00:27:36,940 --> 00:27:38,220
After giving the order,

383
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:40,530
then looked away, letting me go there and get stabbed,

384
00:27:40,700 --> 00:27:42,490
just to make his girlfriend happy.

385
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:48,060
Help Leng Tou bear the blame.

386
00:27:49,220 --> 00:27:50,290
It looks like Miss Ke

387
00:27:50,290 --> 00:27:51,820
express his emotions to you.

388
00:27:51,820 --> 00:27:53,370
Have I offended anyone?

389
00:27:53,940 --> 00:27:55,410
Anyway, I've decided,

390
00:27:55,940 --> 00:27:56,980
I don't want to be anymore

391
00:27:56,980 --> 00:27:57,740
Mr. Feng's driver.

392
00:27:57,740 --> 00:27:58,650
I'll just follow you again.

393
00:27:59,620 --> 00:28:00,530
Today I also met second uncle,

394
00:28:00,530 --> 00:28:01,700
I don't think he hates me.

395
00:28:04,250 --> 00:28:05,580
No, no, no.

396
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:09,290
Childish, too childish.

397
00:28:09,580 --> 00:28:10,460
You follow me,

398
00:28:10,460 --> 00:28:12,290
How could your future be as bright as following Mr. Feng.

399
00:28:12,650 --> 00:28:13,940
However, Sister Qiang,

400
00:28:14,530 --> 00:28:16,220
If I follow you, I can rest easy.

401
00:28:23,100 --> 00:28:24,370
Wu, come here.

402
00:28:25,410 --> 00:28:26,370
Come here, Wu.

403
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,490
You listen to me, okay?

404
00:28:32,370 --> 00:28:34,370
Master Feng is a big tree,

405
00:28:35,700 --> 00:28:37,940
following a big tree, there are benefits.

406
00:28:38,410 --> 00:28:39,580
A real man,

407
00:28:39,580 --> 00:28:41,100
can hold back emotions for a moment,

408
00:28:41,580 --> 00:28:43,490
for long term plans.

409
00:28:45,060 --> 00:28:46,250
You listen to me.

410
00:28:46,700 --> 00:28:47,890
After the wound on your hand

411
00:28:47,890 --> 00:28:48,460
recover later,

412
00:28:48,460 --> 00:28:49,460
return,

413
00:28:49,820 --> 00:28:52,370
and continue to serve Mr. Feng well.

414
00:28:53,860 --> 00:28:54,770
Just consider this incident

415
00:28:54,770 --> 00:28:56,490
absolutely never happened.

416
00:28:59,170 --> 00:29:00,770
Maybe this is it

417
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:02,940
another test from Mr. Feng.

418
00:29:02,940 --> 00:29:03,940
Another test?

419
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,370
After the mid-semester exam, final exam again,

420
00:29:05,370 --> 00:29:06,620
how long do you want to take the exam?

421
00:29:08,410 --> 00:29:09,250
By the way, Sister Qiang,

422
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:09,980
is there anything good?

423
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:11,220
You should also think about me?

424
00:29:11,410 --> 00:29:12,370
I'm completely sincere

425
00:29:12,370 --> 00:29:13,410
just want to come with you.

426
00:29:13,860 --> 00:29:14,820
No problem.

427
00:29:15,770 --> 00:29:16,650
Let's make it like this,

428
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:18,060
later

429
00:29:18,060 --> 00:29:19,410
you accompany me to go drinking.

430
00:29:19,410 --> 00:29:19,940
Can't, can't.

431
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:20,620
My hand hurts,

432
00:29:20,620 --> 00:29:21,940
I took antibiotics.

433
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:23,290
I'm sleepy, I want to go home and sleep.

434
00:29:23,700 --> 00:29:24,530
Like this,

435
00:29:24,530 --> 00:29:26,290
today, just accompany me,

436
00:29:26,410 --> 00:29:27,860
there, I'm drinking, you'll see,

437
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:28,490
How?

438
00:29:29,130 --> 00:29:30,010
I don't drink, okay?

439
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:31,170
You can then.

440
00:29:31,170 --> 00:29:32,010
Come on, come on, come on.

441
00:29:47,580 --> 00:29:48,290
Hide.

442
00:29:49,100 --> 00:29:50,290
Keep hiding.

443
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:52,340
Now that's great, huh?

444
00:29:53,130 --> 00:29:54,890
The phone is not picked up, WeChat is not answered,

445
00:29:54,890 --> 00:29:55,980
what does that mean

446
00:29:57,530 --> 00:29:59,370
Still nobody,

447
00:29:59,370 --> 00:30:01,100
I want to break up with an old friend.

448
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,820
You feel I'm not worthy

449
00:30:03,820 --> 00:30:05,130
be your friend?

450
00:30:05,650 --> 00:30:07,130
Or are you afraid I'll reveal your secret?

451
00:30:09,820 --> 00:30:10,890
Have you had breakfast?

452
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:13,220
What do you mean?

453
00:30:13,370 --> 00:30:15,060
Today I won't be fooled by you, okay?

454
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:27,100
You're investigating the Feng family, right?

455
00:30:32,740 --> 00:30:34,010
What have you got?

456
00:30:40,250 --> 00:30:41,290
You asked this question

457
00:30:41,290 --> 00:30:42,530
with what identity?

458
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,530
Is there any difference?

459
00:30:47,860 --> 00:30:49,010
The difference is huge.

460
00:30:50,530 --> 00:30:51,530
If you're with

461
00:30:51,530 --> 00:30:52,740
identitas tunangan Feng Xiaosheng

462
00:30:52,740 --> 00:30:53,940
ask me this,

463
00:30:55,010 --> 00:30:56,250
then my answer is

464
00:30:56,580 --> 00:30:57,530
I can't say.

465
00:30:59,980 --> 00:31:01,770
What about the identity as a friend?

466
00:31:12,770 --> 00:31:14,580
Three years ago, Feng Group

467
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,650
get a plot of industrial area from the government

468
00:31:16,650 --> 00:31:18,290
at a very cheap price.

469
00:31:19,170 --> 00:31:21,860
Then, by violent means,

470
00:31:21,860 --> 00:31:22,980
they force the population

471
00:31:22,980 --> 00:31:24,170
and workers bear false witness.

472
00:31:24,700 --> 00:31:26,860
Says chemical factories pollute the environment, cause cancer.

473
00:31:27,530 --> 00:31:28,620
Until finally the chemical factory

474
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:30,130
had to close and move.

475
00:31:30,890 --> 00:31:32,460
Then, in a sly way too,

476
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:33,580
industrial area created

477
00:31:33,580 --> 00:31:34,980
become a business area,

478
00:31:35,250 --> 00:31:36,290
building housing,

479
00:31:36,290 --> 00:31:37,770
and got huge profits from it.

480
00:31:41,250 --> 00:31:42,530
What you say is this,

481
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:45,170
is just speculation without clear evidence.

482
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:46,740
Although exposed,

483
00:31:48,170 --> 00:31:49,340
also meaningless.

484
00:31:49,700 --> 00:31:51,460
Will not be able to shake the foundation of the Feng family.

485
00:31:54,460 --> 00:31:55,340
What do you mean?

486
00:31:56,620 --> 00:31:57,460
What I mean is

487
00:31:57,460 --> 00:31:58,290
you don't need to do

488
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,370
this pointless work again.

489
00:32:00,860 --> 00:32:01,770
All this you say,

490
00:32:01,770 --> 00:32:02,530
they definitely have

491
00:32:02,530 --> 00:32:04,620
have the relevant parties

492
00:32:04,620 --> 00:32:05,740
who protects him.

493
00:32:13,700 --> 00:32:14,650
Feng Group,

494
00:32:15,340 --> 00:32:16,490
this big tree

495
00:32:17,410 --> 00:32:18,580
very sturdy,

496
00:32:18,580 --> 00:32:19,940
nothing at all

497
00:32:19,940 --> 00:32:20,980
that you can face.

498
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:24,650
Why do you insist

499
00:32:24,650 --> 00:32:25,530
want to make big news

500
00:32:25,530 --> 00:32:27,290
to prove your own abilities?

501
00:32:29,820 --> 00:32:30,700
You feel it too

502
00:32:31,060 --> 00:32:32,010
I just want to prove it

503
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,130
my own abilities, right?

504
00:32:33,410 --> 00:32:34,650
Isn't that right?

505
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:36,650
All this you do,

506
00:32:36,650 --> 00:32:37,290
isn't it for

507
00:32:37,290 --> 00:32:38,490
prove your own abilities?

508
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,700
Proving your achievements so far

509
00:32:40,700 --> 00:32:42,410
not relying on your mother who is a deputy mayor,

510
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:44,220
but rely on yourself.

511
00:32:44,220 --> 00:32:45,460
However, have you ever thought,

512
00:32:46,060 --> 00:32:47,250
in the process of your proof,

513
00:32:47,250 --> 00:32:48,580
What are you really counting on?

514
00:32:49,980 --> 00:32:50,820
On what basis do other people

515
00:32:50,820 --> 00:32:52,460
let you check as you please?

516
00:32:54,460 --> 00:32:56,100
Jadi, Lian,

517
00:32:57,370 --> 00:32:58,860
don't create problems for yourself,

518
00:32:59,170 --> 00:33:00,340
also don't make trouble

519
00:33:00,340 --> 00:33:01,370
for your mother again, huh?

520
00:33:11,370 --> 00:33:12,100
Ke Ying,

521
00:33:13,130 --> 00:33:14,580
I really misjudged you.

522
00:33:15,530 --> 00:33:16,580
I'm already blind.

523
00:33:16,700 --> 00:33:17,220
So far

524
00:33:17,220 --> 00:33:18,740
consider you as my friend.

525
00:33:20,250 --> 00:33:21,740
You betrayed Yang Yuze,

526
00:33:22,650 --> 00:33:24,170
I will help you find various reasons,

527
00:33:24,700 --> 00:33:25,700
I thought it was a relationship problem

528
00:33:25,700 --> 00:33:26,130
sometimes

529
00:33:26,130 --> 00:33:27,620
cannot be controlled by logic.

530
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,860
However, with what you just said,

531
00:33:33,250 --> 00:33:34,650
You don't deserve to be my friend at all.

532
00:33:44,170 --> 00:33:45,250
You from the outside to the inside,

533
00:33:45,820 --> 00:33:46,980
from individual ethics to social ethics,

534
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:48,290
you really are

535
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:49,700
bastard!

536
00:34:15,380 --> 00:34:19,500
(Parting on bad terms?)

537
00:34:21,740 --> 00:34:25,660
(The closest person is left out.)

538
00:35:05,290 --> 00:35:06,010
An.

539
00:35:06,420 --> 00:35:07,180
To the Ministry of Finance,

540
00:35:07,490 --> 00:35:09,770
get financial audit reports for the last three years.

541
00:35:10,180 --> 00:35:10,820
Good.

542
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:16,770
Anything else needed?

543
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:19,620
Just that.

544
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:25,000
(Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors)

545
00:35:28,290 --> 00:35:29,860
The chairman of the board of directors wants an audit report

546
00:35:29,860 --> 00:35:30,530
three years in a row?

547
00:35:31,490 --> 00:35:32,140
Correct.

548
00:35:32,660 --> 00:35:34,690
He deliberately asked me to take it.

549
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:36,010
There's no problem whatsoever,

550
00:35:36,340 --> 00:35:37,730
why did he suddenly want to see this?

551
00:35:41,860 --> 00:35:42,860
Who is in his place?

552
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:48,010
Miss Ke.

553
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:49,290
Miss Ke?

554
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:50,660
Which Miss Ke?

555
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:56,820
I've remembered.

556
00:35:57,970 --> 00:35:59,820
The chairman of the board of directors' fiancé, right?

557
00:36:03,140 --> 00:36:04,580
Still not married

558
00:36:05,060 --> 00:36:06,530
already acting like a lady boss,

559
00:36:06,770 --> 00:36:07,820
check family assets.

560
00:36:09,010 --> 00:36:09,690
Okay,

561
00:36:10,140 --> 00:36:11,010
you just go out first.

562
00:36:11,450 --> 00:36:12,690
After I finished cleaning it up,

563
00:36:12,820 --> 00:36:14,060
I will personally deliver it to the chairman of the board of directors.

564
00:36:18,730 --> 00:36:19,450
I...

565
00:36:19,930 --> 00:36:21,450
it's best to wait for you here.

566
00:36:42,340 --> 00:36:43,250
Should I prepare a place for you?

567
00:36:43,820 --> 00:36:44,620
No need.

568
00:36:48,010 --> 00:36:49,290
Why room lighting

569
00:36:49,290 --> 00:36:50,100
made so dim?

570
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:51,770
Is this not good?

571
00:36:54,770 --> 00:36:56,140
Because you don't trust anyone,

572
00:36:57,340 --> 00:36:58,730
likes to hide in dark corners,

573
00:36:59,580 --> 00:37:00,690
secretly observing people,

574
00:37:00,690 --> 00:37:01,450
true, right?

575
00:37:03,620 --> 00:37:05,340
Being too clever is not a good thing.

576
00:37:06,340 --> 00:37:08,340
However, now you need a clever person to help you.

577
00:37:11,660 --> 00:37:12,340
Enter.

578
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:14,620
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

579
00:37:21,450 --> 00:37:22,340
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

580
00:37:22,690 --> 00:37:23,580
the document you requested

581
00:37:23,820 --> 00:37:24,820
I've prepared it for you.

582
00:37:31,140 --> 00:37:32,530
You are Miss Ke, right?

583
00:37:39,250 --> 00:37:40,900
Hello, I'm Ke Ying.

584
00:37:41,820 --> 00:37:42,770
Nice to meet you.

585
00:37:46,250 --> 00:37:46,930
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

586
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:48,010
if you have nothing else to do,

587
00:37:48,010 --> 00:37:49,180
I'll go out first.

588
00:38:17,970 --> 00:38:18,970
You look slowly.

589
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,180
I depend on you.

590
00:38:55,690 --> 00:38:56,340
Mr. Feng.

591
00:39:00,580 --> 00:39:01,490
No need to come with me,

592
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,490
I want to take care of personal matters.

593
00:39:17,250 --> 00:39:18,340
What second uncle

594
00:39:18,340 --> 00:39:19,340
and You Qiang started to suspect you?

595
00:39:20,660 --> 00:39:21,660
Second uncle there are few.

596
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:23,730
You Qiang...

597
00:39:24,530 --> 00:39:25,340
still not very.

598
00:39:28,580 --> 00:39:30,010
Pi Ku dan Leng Tou,

599
00:39:30,340 --> 00:39:31,490
I'll go to jail for two more days.

600
00:39:32,930 --> 00:39:34,620
An insignificant little minion

601
00:39:34,620 --> 00:39:35,620
I'll free you first,

602
00:39:35,620 --> 00:39:36,820
help you bear a little of his anger.

603
00:39:39,660 --> 00:39:40,770
Regarding You Qiang,

604
00:39:42,340 --> 00:39:43,730
You have to stick to him well.

605
00:39:44,820 --> 00:39:45,730
Take advantage of this opportunity,

606
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:46,970
come in get to

607
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:48,620
core part of the criminal group.

608
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,690
Stay cool.

609
00:39:54,620 --> 00:39:55,730
For now, I don't need to

610
00:39:55,730 --> 00:39:56,620
went to Feng Xiaosheng's place.

611
00:39:57,290 --> 00:39:58,340
I'll think of a way

612
00:39:58,730 --> 00:40:00,180
to keep a close eye on You Qiang.

613
00:40:03,010 --> 00:40:04,290
Ke Ying poked your hand

614
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,340
to take revenge

615
00:40:05,340 --> 00:40:06,930
because you guys cut off Yang Yuze's fingers, right?

616
00:40:07,730 --> 00:40:08,450
Correct.

617
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,730
He said, pay blood with blood.

618
00:40:12,100 --> 00:40:13,210
Debts must be collected from those who owe them,

619
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,530
why didn't he just look for Feng Xiaosheng?

620
00:40:15,100 --> 00:40:16,250
It is true.

621
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:18,210
Maybe you don't have the heart.

622
00:40:19,530 --> 00:40:20,210
What is it?

623
00:40:23,060 --> 00:40:24,620
The third day after Chen died,

624
00:40:25,930 --> 00:40:27,250
Ke Ying once went to the police station.

625
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:30,730
Shen Shijie...

626
00:40:31,340 --> 00:40:32,660
Shen Shijie tidak mati.

627
00:40:33,620 --> 00:40:34,820
His current name is Feng Xiaosheng.

628
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:36,180
You guys quickly catch him.

629
00:40:37,660 --> 00:40:38,380
Ke Ying bilang

630
00:40:38,380 --> 00:40:40,180
Feng Xiaosheng adalah Shen Shijie?

631
00:40:41,620 --> 00:40:42,730
Why did he say that?

632
00:40:52,820 --> 00:40:54,060
This is Shen Shijie.

633
00:40:57,250 --> 00:40:58,530
It's a bit similar.

634
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,060
However, it cannot be the same person.

635
00:41:03,690 --> 00:41:06,100
Feng Xiaosheng adalah Shen Shijie?

636
00:41:06,100 --> 00:41:07,250
This is impossible.

637
00:41:07,770 --> 00:41:09,180
When Shen Shijie followed second uncle,

638
00:41:09,580 --> 00:41:10,620
Feng Xiaosheng sudah

639
00:41:10,620 --> 00:41:11,730
became chairman of the board of directors of the Feng Group,

640
00:41:11,730 --> 00:41:12,770
there could be no connection.

641
00:41:16,730 --> 00:41:17,820
These instructions

642
00:41:17,820 --> 00:41:19,620
is considered very important by the police.

643
00:41:19,620 --> 00:41:20,290
Especially,

644
00:41:20,290 --> 00:41:21,970
Feng Xiaosheng terus

645
00:41:21,970 --> 00:41:23,580
threatened Ke Ying's safety.

646
00:41:23,730 --> 00:41:24,450
The police

647
00:41:24,450 --> 00:41:26,100
should be involved in this.

648
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:27,060
However...

649
00:41:29,010 --> 00:41:30,290
terkadang, Feng Xiaosheng

650
00:41:30,290 --> 00:41:31,250
it's really not the same

651
00:41:31,250 --> 00:41:32,690
chairman of the board of directors of a company.

652
00:41:33,930 --> 00:41:35,180
He looked more like a black world boss.

653
00:41:39,140 --> 00:41:39,490
He doesn't like it

654
00:41:39,490 --> 00:41:41,340
Play alongside elite executives.

655
00:41:41,820 --> 00:41:43,340
Really like to listen

656
00:41:43,340 --> 00:41:44,970
Pi Ku and others bragged.

657
00:41:46,820 --> 00:41:48,290
If you hear what Brother Qiang means,

658
00:41:49,010 --> 00:41:50,820
Feng Xiaosheng used to be very arrogant,

659
00:41:51,290 --> 00:41:52,620
they couldn't get close to him.

660
00:41:53,530 --> 00:41:54,930
Lately,

661
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,730
just become friendlier.

662
00:41:58,730 --> 00:41:59,930
Let's not discuss Feng Xiaosheng yet,

663
00:42:00,490 --> 00:42:01,620
discuss this Ke Ying.

664
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:03,690
After that case,

665
00:42:04,250 --> 00:42:06,140
he became afraid and hated Shen Shijie.

666
00:42:07,290 --> 00:42:07,970
If he feels

667
00:42:07,970 --> 00:42:09,340
Feng Xiaosheng adalah Shen Shijie...

668
00:42:10,060 --> 00:42:11,060
You also said,

669
00:42:11,490 --> 00:42:12,340
Feng Xiaosheng almost strangled him to death

670
00:42:12,340 --> 00:42:13,580
in the hospital.

671
00:42:14,930 --> 00:42:15,620
However, why him

672
00:42:15,620 --> 00:42:17,450
instead engaged to Feng Xiaosheng?

673
00:42:18,490 --> 00:42:19,770
This doesn't make sense.

674
00:42:22,970 --> 00:42:23,860
It looks like Ke Ying

675
00:42:23,860 --> 00:42:25,180
not simple.

676
00:42:30,210 --> 00:42:31,140
If there's a chance,

677
00:42:31,140 --> 00:42:32,340
try checking the background.

678
00:42:33,730 --> 00:42:35,140
I mean, if there's a chance, yeah.

679
00:42:35,620 --> 00:42:36,690
Don't be reckless.

680
00:42:37,060 --> 00:42:38,620
Your safety must come first.

681
00:42:40,490 --> 00:42:41,340
I know.

682
00:42:45,100 --> 00:42:48,740
(Incoming Call; Chairman of the Board of Directors)

683
00:42:50,340 --> 00:42:50,970
Feng.

684
00:42:57,620 --> 00:42:58,340
Bos.

685
00:43:18,010 --> 00:43:18,660
Sit down.

686
00:43:31,340 --> 00:43:32,340
I can't drink, Sis.

687
00:43:32,970 --> 00:43:33,820
