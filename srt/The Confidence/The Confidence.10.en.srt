3
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:51,780
Halo.

4
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:52,940
Yuze, it's me.

5
00:01:54,460 --> 00:01:56,780
Ying Ying, why did you change your number?

6
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,100
My cell phone was lost,

7
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:01,860
I just changed to a new one.

8
00:02:02,740 --> 00:02:03,940
Have you gotten off the fast train?

9
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:05,180
That's right, just dropped.

10
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:06,260
Uncle accompanied aunt

11
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:07,180
's toilet.

12
00:02:07,260 --> 00:02:08,260
I'm guarding the suitcase.

13
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:09,460
Do you want to talk to them?

14
00:02:09,460 --> 00:02:10,380
No need.

15
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:12,420
Surface.

16
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:15,100
There is something

17
00:02:15,100 --> 00:02:16,420
what I want to convey to you.

18
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:18,580
You listen carefully.

19
00:02:19,660 --> 00:02:20,580
What is it?

20
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:23,460
Like this...

21
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,420
Bos.

22
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:30,100
Correct.

23
00:02:31,180 --> 00:02:32,700
The person is not in the office.

24
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:36,380
I took his cell phone from the drawer.

25
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:38,340
His cell phone was turned off.

26
00:02:38,780 --> 00:02:39,660
Talk about it again after coming back.

27
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:41,140
OK, Boss.

28
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:43,860
Let's go.

29
00:03:00,220 --> 00:03:01,460
Please pay 40 yuan.

30
00:03:06,420 --> 00:03:07,740
I received 40 yuan.

31
00:03:10,900 --> 00:03:12,460
The money is right, go ahead.

32
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:13,380
Thank You.

33
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,340
You're welcome.

34
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:43,820
Open the door!

35
00:03:51,860 --> 00:03:52,420
Open the door!

36
00:03:53,300 --> 00:03:53,940
Halo.

37
00:03:55,540 --> 00:03:57,780
I'm right in front of their door.

38
00:03:58,420 --> 00:03:59,860
The car is parked downstairs,

39
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:01,940
but there was no one in the house.

40
00:04:02,820 --> 00:04:04,700
He had one student named Yu Chengbo.

41
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:07,540
Go to Nanzhou University,

42
00:04:07,540 --> 00:04:09,100
and find this student.

43
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:22,020
Excuse me.

44
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:23,900
I came from out of town

45
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:24,940
to settle matters.

46
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:26,380
My identity was lost on the road,

47
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:27,660
can I stay here?

48
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:28,980
Do you remember your personal identification number?

49
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:31,660
I don't remember.

50
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:33,700
Wait a minute.

51
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,020
This is my teacher's identity,

52
00:04:39,460 --> 00:04:40,940
I am a teacher at Nanzhou University.

53
00:04:40,940 --> 00:04:42,020
Can this be used?

54
00:04:42,020 --> 00:04:42,540
Can,

55
00:04:42,540 --> 00:04:43,900
but can't make a receipt.

56
00:04:43,900 --> 00:04:45,420
It doesn't matter, the important thing is that you can stay overnight.

57
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:00,700
Excuse me.

58
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,300
Over there.

59
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:03,300
Thank You.

60
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,820
Yu Chengbo,

61
00:06:10,820 --> 00:06:11,420
Your lecturer is looking for you

62
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:12,300
under.

63
00:06:12,580 --> 00:06:13,780
Okay.

64
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:44,220
(I offended very scary people.)

65
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:48,800
(Judging from the current situation, you might be involved. For your safety,)

66
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:52,780
(Tomorrow take permission and hide for a few days in your hometown.)

67
00:08:54,500 --> 00:09:00,260
(Yes, Mrs. Ke.)

68
00:09:29,900 --> 00:09:33,820
(Yu Chengbo)

69
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:36,820
Hello, what's wrong?

70
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,100
Miss Lecturer Ke.

71
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:46,260
Open the door.

72
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:50,660
Miss Lecturer Ke,

73
00:10:50,660 --> 00:10:52,420
you really gave me a surprise.

74
00:10:53,060 --> 00:10:54,700
Di... di mana Yu Chengbo?

75
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:55,740
What did you do to him?

76
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:57,140
What can I do to him?

77
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:01,180
He... he's just a student,

78
00:11:02,740 --> 00:11:04,140
has nothing to do with this issue.

79
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:05,140
I...

80
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,420
I shouldn't have involved him.

81
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:08,420
He didn't know anything.

82
00:11:08,420 --> 00:11:10,060
Really, let him go, will you?

83
00:11:10,900 --> 00:11:12,420
If there's anything, just take it out on me,

84
00:11:12,660 --> 00:11:14,020
let him go, okay?

85
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:32,620
Very clever,

86
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,780
exactly the same, yes.

87
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:38,580
Mrs. Ke, you are the first person

88
00:11:38,580 --> 00:11:41,100
who dares to play tricks in front of me.

89
00:12:19,220 --> 00:12:20,860
You came to the provincial capital for this?

90
00:12:25,340 --> 00:12:26,660
Still want to report to the police?

91
00:12:29,620 --> 00:12:31,140
No wonder you stay here.

92
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:34,140
The identity checks aren't strict, right?

93
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:37,700
It's like you want to play with me for life!

94
00:12:40,060 --> 00:12:41,500
You came alone to deliver the letter,

95
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:43,620
still planning to report directly, huh?

96
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:47,980
Ke Ying,

97
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,900
You're also reckless, aren't you?

98
00:12:56,340 --> 00:12:57,300
Honest,

99
00:12:58,620 --> 00:12:59,900
your father, mother, and Yang Yuze,

100
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:00,420
where are you now?

101
00:13:00,420 --> 00:13:01,540
I still haven't found it.

102
00:13:04,540 --> 00:13:05,780
They don't stay overnight at all

103
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:06,860
at the booked hotel.

104
00:13:07,100 --> 00:13:08,780
I've arranged everything.

105
00:13:09,340 --> 00:13:10,900
You can't possibly find them.

106
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:29,180
Shen Shijie,

107
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:30,660
don't move

108
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:31,900
What do you want to do?

109
00:13:44,780 --> 00:13:46,220
Are you sure this could electrocute me to death?

110
00:13:46,660 --> 00:13:48,340
As long as you die,

111
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:53,220
I can just stop playing this crazy game of yours.

112
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,500
My family and friends

113
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,300
new there will be no problems.

114
00:13:58,860 --> 00:14:00,140
What about Yu Chengbo?

115
00:14:01,860 --> 00:14:03,540
You forget it very quickly.

116
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,900
Please!

117
00:14:25,340 --> 00:14:26,660
Please!

118
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,060
Please!

119
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:29,180
I told you,

120
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:32,340
he has nothing to do

121
00:14:32,340 --> 00:14:33,900
with this problem.

122
00:14:33,900 --> 00:14:34,740
He rented a car for you,

123
00:14:34,740 --> 00:14:35,340
buy you a cell phone,

124
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:37,380
this is already related to this problem!

125
00:14:41,020 --> 00:14:42,380
If I die,

126
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:45,540
he must accompany me to die.

127
00:14:54,460 --> 00:14:55,780
Shen Shijie,

128
00:14:58,340 --> 00:14:59,780
you will go to hell.

129
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:00,900
Please!

130
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,500
You are too childish.

131
00:15:05,740 --> 00:15:07,780
Please!

132
00:15:07,900 --> 00:15:08,980
I just came back

133
00:15:08,980 --> 00:15:09,820
from hell, you know, right?

134
00:15:15,620 --> 00:15:17,100
I knew you would run.

135
00:15:19,740 --> 00:15:21,340
However, I really didn't expect it,

136
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,780
you have guts

137
00:15:24,780 --> 00:15:26,380
pulling me to death together.

138
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,780
Good,

139
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:29,580
we die together

140
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:31,500
Go to hell together.

141
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:33,300
Look, you're the one who's scared or I'm the one who's scared!

142
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:45,820
Let go, let him go.

143
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,660
Remember!

144
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,180
Your life is mine.

145
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,460
I didn't tell you to die,

146
00:15:58,460 --> 00:15:59,980
you can't die!

147
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:01,620
You have to live well

148
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,020
in my hell.

149
00:16:03,660 --> 00:16:04,460
Got it, right?

150
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:23,140
- Beat it until it dies. - Hit it to death!

151
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:08,380
(Nanzhou University; University Entry Directions)

152
00:18:05,700 --> 00:18:11,500
(Mrs. Ke, don't look for me; Yu Chengbo)

153
00:18:48,740 --> 00:18:53,940
(surface)

154
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:02,700
Halo.

155
00:19:04,140 --> 00:19:04,660
Ying Ying.

156
00:19:05,260 --> 00:19:06,700
How are you doing there?

157
00:19:07,100 --> 00:19:09,100
Uncle and aunt were starting to get suspicious.

158
00:19:09,540 --> 00:19:11,140
I can't lie to them anymore.

159
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,180
Ying Ying, did you hear?

160
00:19:15,620 --> 00:19:17,220
Tell me, where are you now?

161
00:19:17,220 --> 00:19:18,860
I'll look for you soon.

162
00:19:21,020 --> 00:19:21,820
No need,

163
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:22,740
I am alright

164
00:19:23,580 --> 00:19:24,460
I...

165
00:19:26,740 --> 00:19:28,060
just returned from the provincial capital.

166
00:19:29,300 --> 00:19:30,740
I've confirmed it,

167
00:19:32,500 --> 00:19:33,980
Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie

168
00:19:34,780 --> 00:19:36,220
there is no relationship whatsoever.

169
00:19:37,740 --> 00:19:39,100
Previously it was just a misunderstanding.

170
00:19:42,780 --> 00:19:43,580
I might...

171
00:19:44,340 --> 00:19:46,020
suffered from temporary mental problems.

172
00:19:48,860 --> 00:19:50,260
I'm going to see Doctor Tong.

173
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:53,980
Just calm down,

174
00:19:54,380 --> 00:19:54,980
it's definitely okay,

175
00:19:54,980 --> 00:19:56,140
I'll be home soon.

176
00:20:00,540 --> 00:20:01,100
Good,

177
00:20:01,980 --> 00:20:03,060
I'm waiting for you at home.

178
00:20:04,540 --> 00:20:05,060
See you soon.

179
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:14,260
Don't look for me?

180
00:21:23,460 --> 00:21:25,540
Only I know you are Shen Shijie.

181
00:21:30,180 --> 00:21:31,940
Officer Chen probably already knows too.

182
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:35,260
So, you killed him.

183
00:21:37,300 --> 00:21:38,100
Correct,

184
00:21:38,740 --> 00:21:40,100
initially he didn't have to die.

185
00:21:41,060 --> 00:21:42,540
You're the one who got him involved.

186
00:21:53,220 --> 00:21:54,260
You didn't kill me,

187
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,620
not just to torture me.

188
00:22:00,620 --> 00:22:01,980
Is there any other reason?

189
00:22:02,780 --> 00:22:03,580
By killing me,

190
00:22:05,620 --> 00:22:06,340
then no one knows

191
00:22:06,340 --> 00:22:07,580
that you are Shen Shijie.

192
00:22:10,740 --> 00:22:11,700
Shen Shijie

193
00:22:11,700 --> 00:22:14,300
will be completely destroyed from this world.

194
00:22:14,860 --> 00:22:16,380
Like a pile of mud.

195
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:19,340
Dry in the sun, it crumbles to dust.

196
00:22:20,860 --> 00:22:22,380
Don't know where it will be swept away.

197
00:22:23,380 --> 00:22:24,780
Maybe someone else knows too

198
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:25,580
your secret.

199
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:28,700
However, those people were impatient

200
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:33,660
erasing all traces of you being Shen Shijie.

201
00:22:35,060 --> 00:22:35,780
They are very hopeful

202
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:36,620
you completely

203
00:22:36,620 --> 00:22:37,900
menjadi Feng Xiaosheng.

204
00:22:38,900 --> 00:22:40,100
You don't accept it.

205
00:22:42,660 --> 00:22:43,300
Do not accept

206
00:22:43,300 --> 00:22:44,620
live in this world

207
00:22:45,540 --> 00:22:47,100
with other people's faces.

208
00:22:49,500 --> 00:22:52,140
Even if you live prosperously,

209
00:22:54,060 --> 00:22:55,820
but it's not your own life.

210
00:22:57,980 --> 00:22:58,580
When you're new

211
00:22:58,580 --> 00:23:00,100
changed identity to Feng Xiaosheng,

212
00:23:01,460 --> 00:23:03,100
a criminal dares to die,

213
00:23:03,700 --> 00:23:05,380
suddenly turned into a social elite,

214
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:06,140
powerful people.

215
00:23:08,580 --> 00:23:09,580
You should also be proud,

216
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:10,340
ever happy,

217
00:23:10,340 --> 00:23:12,140
but now you're not anymore.

218
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,460
Because...

219
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:19,180
you're just someone else's replacement,

220
00:23:19,660 --> 00:23:20,980
a shadow,

221
00:23:22,580 --> 00:23:23,940
a doll.

222
00:23:25,500 --> 00:23:26,980
Minimize interacting with people

223
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,860
which is strange.

224
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:30,100
Don't forget your identity.

225
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:36,020
So, you need...

226
00:23:39,460 --> 00:23:42,740
need one person to see you.

227
00:23:43,340 --> 00:23:46,460
Seeing this successful person,

228
00:23:48,060 --> 00:23:49,900
respected people these people.

229
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,420
Asking this person to prove...

230
00:23:56,420 --> 00:23:58,300
in fact he is Shen Shijie.

231
00:24:06,460 --> 00:24:07,700
What you said is right.

232
00:24:09,500 --> 00:24:10,660
Indeed so.

233
00:24:13,740 --> 00:24:15,660
Also you are the only one who still remembers Shen Shijie.

234
00:24:17,460 --> 00:24:18,420
Correct.

235
00:24:21,620 --> 00:24:23,460
Only I remember Shen Shijie.

236
00:24:25,700 --> 00:24:27,540
So, how could he let me go.

237
00:24:30,020 --> 00:24:31,540
The game will still continue,

238
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,860
I like this kind of beginning.

239
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:44,340
This life is very bleak,

240
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:47,780
So, you have to find fun for yourself.

241
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:49,060
True, or not?

242
00:25:10,180 --> 00:25:12,060
Collect all the money I've spent in the past few years

243
00:25:13,420 --> 00:25:15,260
to everyone.

244
00:25:15,260 --> 00:25:16,060
I have an urgent need.

245
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:18,900
This money is very important to me.

246
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:19,780
My family's lives

247
00:25:19,780 --> 00:25:20,860
is in here.

248
00:25:24,060 --> 00:25:25,140
Look for friends you can rely on,

249
00:25:25,700 --> 00:25:26,540
after the business is finished

250
00:25:26,540 --> 00:25:27,620
You guys find a place to hide first.

251
00:25:28,100 --> 00:25:29,380
Wait for the rumors to pass, then come back.

252
00:25:30,380 --> 00:25:30,860
Just calm down,

253
00:25:30,860 --> 00:25:31,900
I will not harm you.

254
00:25:35,620 --> 00:25:38,820
Jie, you hide first,

255
00:25:39,220 --> 00:25:40,740
wait until the rumors have passed, then come back.

256
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,620
Just listen to what your Second Uncle says.

257
00:25:53,500 --> 00:25:54,180
Dao Jian.

258
00:25:56,060 --> 00:25:56,980
You know clearly

259
00:25:56,980 --> 00:25:57,860
where are Jie's places, right?

260
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:58,420
Of.

261
00:25:58,820 --> 00:25:59,860
Watch closely.

262
00:26:01,540 --> 00:26:02,020
Understand.

263
00:26:03,020 --> 00:26:03,420
Later,

264
00:26:04,420 --> 00:26:05,780
His territory will be yours.

265
00:26:07,500 --> 00:26:08,340
Thank you, Second Uncle.

266
00:26:21,940 --> 00:26:22,540
Kak Qiang.

267
00:26:24,540 --> 00:26:25,340
Sis Wu.

268
00:26:25,940 --> 00:26:27,700
You have now climbed to a high branch, yes.

269
00:26:28,860 --> 00:26:30,140
In your eyes you no longer look at us,

270
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:31,380
your friends are downstairs, right?

271
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:33,580
Look at your character.

272
00:26:34,420 --> 00:26:35,900
Am I that kind of person?

273
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:39,300
Follow people like Dao Jian,

274
00:26:40,020 --> 00:26:42,140
sleep should not be too sleepy.

275
00:26:42,260 --> 00:26:43,700
Don't wake up as soon as you wake up,

276
00:26:44,340 --> 00:26:46,380
there are several body parts missing.

277
00:27:03,580 --> 00:27:04,340
Kak Qiang.

278
00:27:05,780 --> 00:27:07,380
These days, I don't follow Dao Jian,

279
00:27:11,860 --> 00:27:13,940
Dao Jian menyuruhku ikut dengan Feng Xiaosheng.

280
00:27:17,220 --> 00:27:17,900
Really?

281
00:27:18,140 --> 00:27:18,700
Really.

282
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,980
What kind of tactic is this?

283
00:27:23,460 --> 00:27:25,060
I... I'm confused too.

284
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:27,260
Maybe that day was a coincidence,

285
00:27:27,660 --> 00:27:28,820
coincidental meeting.

286
00:27:29,260 --> 00:27:30,980
Mr Feng told me to drive for him.

287
00:27:36,540 --> 00:27:37,500
You're great too, kid.

288
00:27:37,500 --> 00:27:38,580
The feet of this Money God alone

289
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:39,820
you can hug.

290
00:27:39,980 --> 00:27:40,580
Nope.

291
00:27:41,180 --> 00:27:42,540
Isn't he just second uncle's nephew?

292
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:43,740
What is great?

293
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:45,940
Second uncle,

294
00:27:45,940 --> 00:27:46,740
Mr. Feng,

295
00:27:46,740 --> 00:27:48,300
and Big Boss Feng in comparison,

296
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,420
it's the same as...

297
00:27:53,140 --> 00:27:55,220
Anyway, the difference is very big.

298
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,860
Wu,

299
00:28:00,820 --> 00:28:01,900
follow them well.

300
00:28:02,100 --> 00:28:03,180
Maybe later Kak Qiang

301
00:28:03,180 --> 00:28:04,260
still have to depend on you.

302
00:28:04,260 --> 00:28:05,460
Don't, don't do that, Kak Qiang.

303
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,300
Don't talk like that.

304
00:28:07,300 --> 00:28:08,180
I can't bear it.

305
00:28:08,620 --> 00:28:09,860
Against you, against second uncle,

306
00:28:09,860 --> 00:28:11,820
I will definitely be loyal,

307
00:28:11,820 --> 00:28:12,860
it is impossible to betray.

308
00:28:28,660 --> 00:28:29,460
Put a thousand.

309
00:28:30,820 --> 00:28:31,700
Open it, okay?

310
00:28:34,620 --> 00:28:36,220
This time open the big one.

311
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,500
Mr Bie, it's time.

312
00:29:03,420 --> 00:29:04,420
Just that much,

313
00:29:04,780 --> 00:29:05,580
no longer.

314
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:22,460
I tell you Mr Bie,

315
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,100
today I just moved money.

316
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:26,340
In nominal terms, you can just talk to second uncle.

317
00:30:18,820 --> 00:30:20,220
(General Manager's Office)

318
00:30:38,100 --> 00:30:38,820
Kak Qiang.

319
00:30:55,540 --> 00:30:56,820
Be careful on the road, Sister Qiang.

320
00:30:57,500 --> 00:30:58,340
Be careful on the way.

321
00:31:41,020 --> 00:31:41,980
Paman Quan,

322
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:43,780
You're always very healthy, aren't you?

323
00:31:50,300 --> 00:31:51,260
You...

324
00:31:51,580 --> 00:31:53,020
bring a message to Meng.

325
00:31:53,300 --> 00:31:54,180
Say.

326
00:31:55,020 --> 00:31:57,700
My debt is paid off,

327
00:31:58,740 --> 00:32:00,180
this is the last one.

328
00:32:01,180 --> 00:32:02,700
Don't worry, I'll definitely tell you.

329
00:32:38,940 --> 00:32:40,580
Take care, Uncle Quan.

330
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:54,700
How do you drive this?

331
00:32:54,700 --> 00:32:55,580
Not so, Sister Qiang.

332
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:58,700
I was nervous when I saw those posts.

333
00:32:58,700 --> 00:32:59,460
Whofire

334
00:32:59,540 --> 00:33:00,740
you're so cowardly!

335
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:00,980
You're great, you're great.

336
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:02,260
Everyone shut up.

337
00:33:06,740 --> 00:33:08,100
This is a big thing,

338
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,340
everyone be a little careful.

339
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:19,460
Kak Qiang,

340
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:21,140
what happened today?

341
00:33:21,340 --> 00:33:21,940
We used to too

342
00:33:21,940 --> 00:33:23,380
didn't spend that much money, right?

343
00:33:23,380 --> 00:33:24,180
Have a second uncle,

344
00:33:24,180 --> 00:33:24,980
I don't know why either

345
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:26,100
rush to get it back.

346
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:28,460
Second uncle also gave loans?

347
00:33:30,740 --> 00:33:32,540
Ask less questions, live longer.

348
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,020
Okay.

349
00:33:39,660 --> 00:33:40,660
Lately, they have been frequent

350
00:33:40,660 --> 00:33:41,980
appeared in these places.

351
00:33:42,780 --> 00:33:43,740
Every time

352
00:33:43,740 --> 00:33:44,900
definitely bring a big bag,

353
00:33:44,900 --> 00:33:45,340
copper.

354
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,300
There must be money in it.

355
00:33:48,900 --> 00:33:50,180
Look, they're all nervous.

356
00:33:52,620 --> 00:33:53,780
After putting the items in,

357
00:33:53,780 --> 00:33:54,820
they started going around in circles

358
00:33:54,820 --> 00:33:55,940
in the alley.

359
00:33:55,940 --> 00:33:57,780
I was afraid of making them wary, after that I didn't follow them again.

360
00:33:59,020 --> 00:33:59,700
Kapten Xiao,

361
00:33:59,700 --> 00:34:00,740
next we...

362
00:34:04,420 --> 00:34:05,460
Today got here first,

363
00:34:05,460 --> 00:34:06,820
I still have business to go out for a while.

364
00:34:07,060 --> 00:34:08,060
You archive it

365
00:34:08,060 --> 00:34:08,820
these photos.

366
00:34:08,820 --> 00:34:09,540
You guys have worked hard.

367
00:34:09,540 --> 00:34:10,740
- Okay. - Okay.

368
00:34:21,620 --> 00:34:23,300
All cash?

369
00:34:24,540 --> 00:34:25,500
Not just cash,

370
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:27,060
there is gold too.

371
00:34:28,140 --> 00:34:28,700
Then, where does the money go?

372
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:30,140
finally brought?

373
00:34:31,380 --> 00:34:32,140
Dao Jian.

374
00:34:53,260 --> 00:34:54,100
Dao Jian brought people

375
00:34:54,100 --> 00:34:55,100
then take it.

376
00:34:56,500 --> 00:34:57,700
Listen to what You Qiang said,

377
00:34:57,700 --> 00:34:59,140
this is the money that second uncle spent.

378
00:34:59,220 --> 00:35:01,740
Lately, he had been in a hurry to want her back.

379
00:35:01,740 --> 00:35:03,380
He said there was an urgent need.

380
00:35:11,060 --> 00:35:12,020
Here.

381
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:16,060
Okay.

382
00:35:17,460 --> 00:35:18,660
When you come home, be a little careful.

383
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:21,820
Kapten Xiao, Kapten Xiao, Kapten Xiao.

384
00:35:22,460 --> 00:35:23,100
What is it?

385
00:35:24,860 --> 00:35:25,300
That...

386
00:35:25,860 --> 00:35:27,340
next time when we meet

387
00:35:27,340 --> 00:35:28,580
can you change places?

388
00:35:28,780 --> 00:35:29,500
Why?

389
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:31,060
This place,

390
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:32,300
if seen by someone you know,

391
00:35:33,220 --> 00:35:34,420
maybe it will be misunderstood.

392
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:40,780
This is for your security.

393
00:35:41,020 --> 00:35:42,740
Next time, when we meet again,

394
00:35:43,060 --> 00:35:44,460
call the receptionist directly,

395
00:35:44,460 --> 00:35:46,500
give me your name then we'll talk directly.

396
00:35:46,500 --> 00:35:47,500
Cape... Kapten Xiao.

397
00:35:48,140 --> 00:35:49,220
Why else?

398
00:35:49,220 --> 00:35:50,420
Try to see if it's possible or not,

399
00:35:50,420 --> 00:35:51,100
I will remember this little door,

400
00:35:51,100 --> 00:35:52,340
next time I will enter from this small door,

401
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,620
entering like this is also no problem, right?

402
00:35:53,620 --> 00:35:54,340
You can, right?

403
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:54,940
Can't.

404
00:35:54,940 --> 00:35:55,500
Why?

405
00:35:55,500 --> 00:35:56,140
You still have to

406
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:58,140
entered from the front door mysteriously.

407
00:35:58,140 --> 00:35:58,820
On what basis?

408
00:35:58,820 --> 00:36:00,740
This is for your security.

409
00:36:06,340 --> 00:36:07,500
Security?

410
00:36:24,740 --> 00:36:25,500
Are you ready to go?

411
00:36:25,820 --> 00:36:26,460
See you soon.

412
00:36:32,340 --> 00:36:33,540
Bring this medicine.

413
00:36:36,900 --> 00:36:37,740
Thank You.

414
00:36:41,380 --> 00:36:44,740
(Male Reproductive Specialist)

415
00:37:01,220 --> 00:37:01,780
Kapten Xiao.

416
00:37:06,260 --> 00:37:07,140
This is a number plate

417
00:37:07,140 --> 00:37:07,900
the goods car.

418
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:09,020
Check it immediately.

419
00:37:09,020 --> 00:37:10,580
Especially you should pay attention to the alleys and fishing villages.

420
00:37:13,060 --> 00:37:14,220
Captain Xiao, are you...

421
00:37:14,420 --> 00:37:14,940
suspect they will

422
00:37:14,940 --> 00:37:16,420
take the cash out?

423
00:37:16,660 --> 00:37:17,780
Bring cash?

424
00:37:17,780 --> 00:37:19,020
What era is it now?

425
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,820
Where possible to use

426
00:37:19,820 --> 00:37:20,500
the old fashioned way

427
00:37:20,500 --> 00:37:21,700
and risky like that?

428
00:37:22,580 --> 00:37:23,660
The investigative team is already monitoring it

429
00:37:23,660 --> 00:37:24,900
Feng family account.

430
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,820
Feng Meng wants to move large amounts of money,

431
00:37:26,820 --> 00:37:27,820
but you can't go through the bank.

432
00:37:27,820 --> 00:37:29,700
So, can only go back to the old way.

433
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:31,340
Find this car, keep a close eye on it.

434
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:31,940
Don't let them

435
00:37:31,940 --> 00:37:33,020
take this money out.

436
00:37:33,020 --> 00:37:33,380
Good.

437
00:37:33,500 --> 00:37:34,060
Good.

438
00:37:40,380 --> 00:37:41,140
Please come in.

439
00:37:42,620 --> 00:37:43,580
This is your house?

440
00:37:43,820 --> 00:37:45,660
That's right, please sit anywhere.

441
00:38:10,100 --> 00:38:11,100
Here is hidden

442
00:38:11,100 --> 00:38:12,940
a large crime family.

443
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,540
Investigate them,

444
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:15,700
means there will be risks

445
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,100
lose your life at any time.

446
00:38:17,780 --> 00:38:18,980
Apart from that, there is still a terrible reality

447
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,340
what you have to face.

448
00:38:23,820 --> 00:38:24,180
Did you forget

449
00:38:24,180 --> 00:38:25,780
words I've said before?

450
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:27,300
This problem

451
00:38:27,620 --> 00:38:29,340
I have to investigate until it's clear.

452
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:31,900
Good.

453
00:38:34,340 --> 00:38:35,780
If you want to investigate the Feng family,

454
00:38:36,260 --> 00:38:37,940
must start from the history of development

455
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:39,580
the two Feng family brothers.

456
00:38:39,740 --> 00:38:40,460
Feng Meng.

457
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:41,940
Known as second uncle.

458
00:38:42,340 --> 00:38:43,420
Haven't graduated from middle school yet,

459
00:38:43,420 --> 00:38:45,100
has started to start a restaurant, recording studio,

460
00:38:45,100 --> 00:38:45,940
karaoke,

461
00:38:45,940 --> 00:38:47,100
and game studios.

462
00:38:47,300 --> 00:38:48,380
Employ a group of subordinates

463
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,580
to keep an eye on the places.

464
00:38:49,580 --> 00:38:50,260
Soon after,

465
00:38:50,260 --> 00:38:51,980
he became a famous boss in his world.

466
00:38:52,940 --> 00:38:53,780
Feng Yong.

467
00:38:54,420 --> 00:38:55,820
Namely Big Boss Feng.

468
00:38:56,300 --> 00:38:57,460
When young,

469
00:38:57,460 --> 00:38:58,860
used to be a sports teacher.

470
00:38:58,980 --> 00:39:00,620
The era of reform he led clashed

471
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:01,460
and have hurt other people.

472
00:39:02,060 --> 00:39:03,100
1993,

473
00:39:03,100 --> 00:39:04,300
starting a sand mine

474
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,220
and stone quarries.

475
00:39:05,740 --> 00:39:07,180
In a short time,

476
00:39:07,180 --> 00:39:07,700
he monopolizes

477
00:39:07,700 --> 00:39:09,380
sand mines all over the city,

478
00:39:09,620 --> 00:39:11,100
its assets amount to hundreds of millions of yuan.

479
00:39:11,460 --> 00:39:12,980
When he already has capital,

480
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:14,700
his relationship with several offices

481
00:39:15,100 --> 00:39:16,020
getting closer every day.

482
00:39:27,460 --> 00:39:29,460
The Feng brothers' four business establishments and two mines,

483
00:39:29,940 --> 00:39:31,580
is a traditional black business.

484
00:39:31,780 --> 00:39:33,700
Using violence, accumulating wealth.

485
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:35,940
After that, it started to change.

486
00:39:36,860 --> 00:39:38,460
Feng Yong holds both business and politics.

487
00:39:38,700 --> 00:39:39,940
From the outside it looks clean,

488
00:39:40,260 --> 00:39:41,540
at the same time also in control of the casino,

489
00:39:41,540 --> 00:39:42,740
bars and high interest loans.

490
00:39:43,260 --> 00:39:44,100
This situation

491
00:39:44,100 --> 00:39:45,340
continues until...

492
00:39:47,020 --> 00:39:49,620
Feng Xiaosheng took over the Feng Group.

493
00:39:50,380 --> 00:39:51,460
Feng Xiaosheng?

494
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,980
I know him.

495
00:39:53,260 --> 00:39:54,460
I once interviewed him.

496
00:39:55,340 --> 00:39:56,700
He has his own understanding

497
00:39:56,700 --> 00:39:58,380
on the economy and investment.

498
00:39:58,580 --> 00:40:00,780
He is a very smart businessman.

499
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:01,540
Correct.

500
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:03,100
With connections and relationships

501
00:40:03,100 --> 00:40:04,260
that Big Boss Feng had.

502
00:40:04,260 --> 00:40:06,500
Coupled with Feng Xiaosheng's economic brain.

503
00:40:07,380 --> 00:40:08,940
Feng family assets

504
00:40:08,940 --> 00:40:11,140
increased more than tens of times.

505
00:40:11,140 --> 00:40:12,140
In the country continue to give loans,

506
00:40:12,140 --> 00:40:13,340
abroad continue to buy.

507
00:40:13,620 --> 00:40:14,900
Spending billions of euros

508
00:40:14,900 --> 00:40:17,460
to purchase the entire German new energy production process.

509
00:40:17,620 --> 00:40:19,580
Then, spend tens of billions

510
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:21,540
to buy mines in South Africa, Brazil and Europe.

511
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:22,900
Most of the Feng family's property

512
00:40:22,900 --> 00:40:24,380
flowing abroad.

513
00:40:24,380 --> 00:40:26,340
Then, through various paths

514
00:40:26,340 --> 00:40:27,780
collected into a personal account

515
00:40:27,780 --> 00:40:30,020
Feng Xiaosheng di Swiss.

516
00:40:31,540 --> 00:40:34,500
Are you the one investigating all this?

517
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,300
Not me.

518
00:40:37,380 --> 00:40:38,580
My teacher.

519
00:40:39,100 --> 00:40:41,380
They destroyed all their criminal evidence.

520
00:40:41,780 --> 00:40:42,780
Meanwhile my teacher,

521
00:40:42,780 --> 00:40:44,860
his career also ended then and there,

522
00:40:45,100 --> 00:40:46,300
one leg is also paralyzed.

523
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:49,420
Since my teacher was hit by an accident,

524
00:40:50,700 --> 00:40:53,020
no one dared to investigate them anymore.

525
00:42:09,580 --> 00:42:10,900
Mr. Feng, you're okay, right?

526
00:42:11,500 --> 00:42:12,220
Let go.

527
00:42:36,100 --> 00:42:37,020
Don't play dead.

528
00:42:39,060 --> 00:42:40,060
Mr. Feng,

529
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:42,780
I'm just your training companion,

530
00:42:43,500 --> 00:42:45,100
You are too cruel.

531
00:42:47,580 --> 00:42:49,060
This should count as a work injury, yes.

532
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:50,540
Give me more medical money.

533
00:42:50,540 --> 00:42:52,300
You also have to treat me to a delicious meal to restore me.

534
00:42:58,580 --> 00:42:59,100
Mr. Feng,

535
00:42:59,780 --> 00:43:00,980
my blind attack earlier

536
00:43:01,380 --> 00:43:02,420
Not bad, right?

537
00:43:04,980 --> 00:43:05,980
Reasonable.

538
00:43:13,540 --> 00:43:14,740
Your kick is also not bad.

539
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:27,620
Add another portion of bacon.

540
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:29,380
Please.

541
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,780
