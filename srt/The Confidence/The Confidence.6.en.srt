00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,940
=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 6=

3
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,900
Dokter Zhang, ya?

4
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:48,500
How is he now?

5
00:01:50,820 --> 00:01:51,780
Now this...

6
00:01:52,020 --> 00:01:54,020
the patient was hit in the head,

7
00:01:54,140 --> 00:01:56,100
chest, back, hands and feet.

8
00:01:56,300 --> 00:01:58,140
There was a lot of bleeding all over his body.

9
00:01:58,900 --> 00:02:00,660
Apart from that, during the inspection,

10
00:02:00,860 --> 00:02:03,220
The patient still experiences vomiting of blood and dizziness.

11
00:02:04,180 --> 00:02:06,660
It's still not certain whether there was a head injury.

12
00:02:06,860 --> 00:02:08,580
or on internal organs.

13
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:11,260
Patients need to be hospitalized for observation for some time.

14
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:14,300
We will immediately arrange a head CT-scan for him.

15
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:15,900
also an ultrasound examination of the chest and abdomen.

16
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:16,620
Good.

17
00:02:17,540 --> 00:02:19,300
What is your relationship with the patient?

18
00:02:19,460 --> 00:02:20,900
We are good friends.

19
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:23,140
How could he be injured?

20
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:26,060
He was robbed.

21
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:27,220
Have you reported the police?

22
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:28,500
Already.

23
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:30,460
All those people have been arrested,

24
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:32,060
we just came back from the police station.

25
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,060
Here's the bill,

26
00:02:34,540 --> 00:02:35,780
go pay the fee,

27
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:37,260
and take care of the procedures first.

28
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:39,980
Pay, huh?

29
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:40,420
Good.

30
00:03:00,100 --> 00:03:02,940
(Ke Xiaowen, Female, 27 Years Old) Ke Xiaowen.

31
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:20,260
The beating was brutal, it was outrageous.

32
00:03:27,460 --> 00:03:28,540
Judging from your demeanor,

33
00:03:28,540 --> 00:03:29,860
You're still a student, right?

34
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,580
If you wear a white shirt,

35
00:03:33,580 --> 00:03:34,500
white sports shoes,

36
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,500
walking on the field, how cool is that,

37
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:37,460
how stylish is that.

38
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:39,500
Much more beautiful

39
00:03:39,860 --> 00:03:41,500
than you wear the revealing clothes.

40
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,780
Really.

41
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,140
You're...

42
00:03:47,180 --> 00:03:48,220
instead of working in another industry,

43
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:50,460
instead work in this industry.

44
00:03:52,740 --> 00:03:55,140
What future could there be in this industry?

45
00:03:56,180 --> 00:03:57,940
Moreover, your bad temper,

46
00:03:57,940 --> 00:03:59,420
completely unsuitable in this industry.

47
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:04,100
If I were you, I would have repented long ago.

48
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:05,580
Play with them...

49
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,860
You... are you awake?

50
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:16,380
Would you like to drink water or something?

51
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:24,780
Don't cry, don't cry.

52
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:27,060
Don't get me wrong. I I...

53
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:28,580
I... I said something wrong.

54
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,540
You... you don't cry yet.

55
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,580
No, I didn't mean it like that.

56
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:35,140
You listen to me.

57
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,100
I now give you...

58
00:04:36,100 --> 00:04:36,740
Get out.

59
00:04:37,020 --> 00:04:38,140
You can't be like this.

60
00:04:38,300 --> 00:04:39,580
Your treatment costs tens of thousands,

61
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,220
I paid for it for you, where would I have that much money?

62
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:41,900
All my savings

63
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:43,020
I've put it out for you.

64
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:45,140
Get out.

65
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:46,340
I'm going, going.

66
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,300
You... don't be emotional.

67
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:48,260
I'm leaving, okay?

68
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:03,180
(06F, Beds 11-40)

69
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:16,980
I didn't do it on purpose either.

70
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:17,860
This bad temper,

71
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:19,620
who got you used to it?

72
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,140
That is true.

73
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:26,460
Addressing a girl like this,

74
00:05:27,340 --> 00:05:28,940
it's a bit exaggerated.

75
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:30,260
Talk harshly.

76
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,580
You're home pretty early, huh?

77
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,100
(I wonder who betrayed Sis Jie...)

78
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:52,540
(You are different from them.)

79
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,940
You have more conscience than them.

80
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:55,700
You have a greater sense of justice than them.

81
00:06:55,940 --> 00:06:57,180
You are more sincere than them.

82
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:00,300
Moreover, you have your own limits.

83
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:02,660
(Information you helped us get)

84
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:04,220
(very, very, very important.)

85
00:07:04,380 --> 00:07:05,660
(I represent my partner)

86
00:07:06,140 --> 00:07:07,020
and also myself,

87
00:07:07,860 --> 00:07:09,540
show you our respect.

88
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:37,540
I really can't go.

89
00:07:37,700 --> 00:07:38,620
You tell anyone to come looking for me,

90
00:07:38,620 --> 00:07:39,460
I still can't go.

91
00:07:39,460 --> 00:07:40,980
We have a rule not to drink alcohol.

92
00:07:41,220 --> 00:07:41,780
Kapten Xiao.

93
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:43,180
True, can't drink alcohol,

94
00:07:43,180 --> 00:07:44,260
weekends are also not allowed to drink.

95
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,700
Must remain conscious,

96
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,580
ready to take orders at any time.

97
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:48,580
Kapten Xiao.

98
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,780
Never mind, not chatting with you anymore.

99
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,380
I work.

100
00:07:53,780 --> 00:07:55,380
This was sent from the Technology Division.

101
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,900
This is from the bag that Inspector Chen carried on the night of the incident.

102
00:07:58,100 --> 00:07:59,380
Checked, no problems whatsoever.

103
00:07:59,620 --> 00:08:00,580
What do you think should be done with this?

104
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:02,420
From where?

105
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:03,500
Lingbei City police station.

106
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:06,580
OK, give it to me.

107
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,620
Find out who did it.

108
00:08:17,740 --> 00:08:19,580
Especially those related to Shen Shijie.

109
00:08:19,700 --> 00:08:20,820
Check them one by one.

110
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:22,540
Even the police dare to be killed,

111
00:08:22,540 --> 00:08:24,100
really gone crazy.

112
00:08:29,100 --> 00:08:29,700
Second Uncle,

113
00:08:30,460 --> 00:08:31,740
Do you think Sis Jie...

114
00:08:32,140 --> 00:08:33,460
is he really dead?

115
00:08:34,020 --> 00:08:35,020
Can it be faked?

116
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:38,780
Then, does he have a friend who is willing to die for him,

117
00:08:39,180 --> 00:08:40,620
who could know everything about him?

118
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:42,020
I ask you to check it,

119
00:08:42,020 --> 00:08:43,260
why are you asking me?

120
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:44,940
You check... quickly check.

121
00:08:45,660 --> 00:08:46,900
After checking it, quickly handle it,

122
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:47,940
don't leave any marks.

123
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:53,220
(Outpatient Installation)

124
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:54,900
You eat a little, Miss.

125
00:08:55,980 --> 00:08:57,300
I've apologized to you.

126
00:08:57,420 --> 00:08:57,980
According to you...

127
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,820
Are you mad at me,

128
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:03,380
In the end, you are the one who suffers.

129
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:04,540
Wu.

130
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,300
Have arrived.

131
00:09:11,700 --> 00:09:12,780
Even still hospitalized,

132
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:14,140
good at pretending, yes.

133
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:20,020
Forest, Forest.

134
00:09:20,700 --> 00:09:21,500
broken ribs,

135
00:09:21,980 --> 00:09:22,860
concussion,

136
00:09:23,020 --> 00:09:24,060
internal organ bleeding,

137
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:25,900
almost half of his life was gone.

138
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:30,060
During the examination, the hospital almost reported it to the police.

139
00:09:30,380 --> 00:09:31,340
I made up a lot of lies,

140
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:32,220
just managed to lie to him.

141
00:09:32,420 --> 00:09:33,020
Report to the police?

142
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:35,220
Fine, let them try.

143
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:37,820
I will destroy this dilapidated hospital!

144
00:09:37,940 --> 00:09:38,380
Correct.

145
00:09:38,860 --> 00:09:40,380
I also scared them like that.

146
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,460
However, Boss,

147
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:46,260
this girl is in trouble,

148
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:47,060
the great bleeding,

149
00:09:47,060 --> 00:09:47,900
constantly vomiting blood,

150
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:48,940
I saw it myself.

151
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:51,420
If you really die,

152
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:52,780
the problem will be big.

153
00:09:54,100 --> 00:09:55,100
What's that?

154
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:56,340
Come on, get up, let me see.

155
00:09:56,340 --> 00:09:57,340
Aren't you aware?

156
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:58,140
That's it, that's it.

157
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:00,300
Why are you angry with a woman of the night?

158
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:01,100
We'll talk outside.

159
00:10:14,420 --> 00:10:15,500
You two wait for me there.

160
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:19,540
(06F, Beds 11-40)

161
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:22,100
Come on, Boss,

162
00:10:22,380 --> 00:10:23,580
don't be angry anymore, smoke.

163
00:10:26,060 --> 00:10:27,860
You tell me the truth.

164
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:29,620
What is it?

165
00:10:30,820 --> 00:10:32,380
Do you like this girl?

166
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:35,700
I... I like it, Boss?

167
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,420
How much do I like wearing a green hat?

168
00:10:37,420 --> 00:10:38,620
She is a woman of the night.

169
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,300
Boss, you always joke with me.

170
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,060
Base.

171
00:10:48,980 --> 00:10:49,860
Boss, I'll answer the phone first.

172
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:51,980
Hello, who?

173
00:10:52,540 --> 00:10:53,420
Is this Meng Hui?

174
00:10:53,820 --> 00:10:54,420
Yes, me.

175
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,860
I'm Xiao Tongbin from the Criminal Investigation Unit.

176
00:10:59,780 --> 00:11:00,220
Chen Jinyan,

177
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,660
Officer Chen, you know him, right?

178
00:11:10,300 --> 00:11:11,740
Not buying a house.

179
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:13,580
Who wants to buy a house?

180
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:14,100
You didn't see either

181
00:11:14,100 --> 00:11:15,060
how much money do I have.

182
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:15,980
Call me every day,

183
00:11:15,980 --> 00:11:17,100
to sell a house, sell a house.

184
00:11:17,580 --> 00:11:18,580
Don't call me again!

185
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:20,820
It sucks.

186
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,860
This damn agent,

187
00:11:26,860 --> 00:11:27,940
call me every day.

188
00:11:30,660 --> 00:11:32,060
Which housing is for sale?

189
00:11:32,820 --> 00:11:33,860
Which housing?

190
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:36,860
I really didn't hear about that.

191
00:11:38,740 --> 00:11:39,660
Give me the number.

192
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,580
Recently I have been planning to buy a house.

193
00:11:43,060 --> 00:11:44,740
Boss, this house is definitely not a good house.

194
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,500
A good house is definitely not difficult to sell,

195
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:47,660
even still offering it.

196
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:50,940
Give it to me.

197
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,300
Password.

198
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:16,740
330083

199
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:23,340
Speak.

200
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:40,860
Halo.

201
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:44,940
Halo.

202
00:12:45,460 --> 00:12:47,260
This is Anju Estate Agent.

203
00:12:47,540 --> 00:12:48,500
I am Wang.

204
00:12:48,500 --> 00:12:50,140
Do you need help?

205
00:12:50,140 --> 00:12:51,020
Do you want to buy a house?

206
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:56,660
Not buying a house.

207
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,100
Do you want to sell your house?

208
00:12:59,300 --> 00:13:00,380
I'm not selling the house either.

209
00:13:00,900 --> 00:13:01,900
So, do you want to rent a house?

210
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:03,340
House rental costs have been rising recently.

211
00:13:03,420 --> 00:13:05,100
We can check your housing location,

212
00:13:05,100 --> 00:13:06,220
help you negotiate a good price.

213
00:13:06,220 --> 00:13:07,140
Get out!

214
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:16,100
Boss, you... didn't buy a house?

215
00:13:16,380 --> 00:13:17,580
Where does that much nonsense come from!

216
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,580
Watch this girl well.

217
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:25,740
Can't go a single step.

218
00:13:27,220 --> 00:13:28,060
I understand, Boss.

219
00:14:21,340 --> 00:14:21,860
Kapten Xiao.

220
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,420
The thug has confessed.

221
00:14:31,340 --> 00:14:32,220
Xu Jie?

222
00:14:33,580 --> 00:14:34,620
Who is Xu Jie?

223
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,260
Bukankah Dao Jian?

224
00:14:37,100 --> 00:14:38,740
He was adamant, he said...

225
00:14:45,540 --> 00:14:46,140
Halo.

226
00:14:46,660 --> 00:14:46,940
Halo.

227
00:14:47,900 --> 00:14:49,380
You called me earlier,

228
00:14:49,700 --> 00:14:51,020
I'm not free to talk.

229
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:53,700
You know Chen, right?

230
00:14:54,140 --> 00:14:54,780
Familiar.

231
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,740
Chen left something for you,

232
00:14:56,860 --> 00:14:58,140
when do you have time?

233
00:14:58,740 --> 00:14:59,740
I'll bring it for you.

234
00:15:00,340 --> 00:15:01,140
What item?

235
00:15:01,420 --> 00:15:02,620
It's hard to explain on the phone,

236
00:15:02,620 --> 00:15:03,700
how about meeting to talk about it?

237
00:15:03,700 --> 00:15:04,500
You see,

238
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:06,020
Which place is more free to meet?

239
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:22,620
(Bed 07-08)

240
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,540
Excuse me.

241
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:55,340
Sorry, my phone is broken,

242
00:15:55,500 --> 00:15:56,780
can't contact people at home.

243
00:15:57,100 --> 00:15:59,460
Can I borrow your phone to make a quick call?

244
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:00,860
OK, call.

245
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:02,060
Thank You.

246
00:16:22,100 --> 00:16:22,700
(Sorry,)

247
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,420
(the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

248
00:16:37,140 --> 00:16:37,780
Rebound.

249
00:16:37,780 --> 00:16:39,060
Fine.

250
00:16:40,060 --> 00:16:40,900
Whose phone?

251
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,180
Whose cell phone is ringing?

252
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:47,500
Mine.

253
00:16:49,580 --> 00:16:50,220
Replace me.

254
00:16:50,700 --> 00:16:51,540
Continue, continue.

255
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:53,940
Halo.

256
00:16:54,300 --> 00:16:55,980
Halo, Yu Chengbo.

257
00:16:55,980 --> 00:16:56,780
Bu Ke.

258
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:59,140
Can I ask for your help?

259
00:17:11,220 --> 00:17:12,140
Patient in bed eight.

260
00:17:13,180 --> 00:17:13,980
Yes, you.

261
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,260
If there is no problem, don't go anywhere.

262
00:17:16,260 --> 00:17:17,860
Your boyfriend can't even find you.

263
00:17:19,420 --> 00:17:20,340
I know.

264
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:40,980
Already up?

265
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,500
Are you looking for me?

266
00:17:45,820 --> 00:17:46,540
Are you looking for me?

267
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:47,700
Earlier the nurse said you were looking for me.

268
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:48,540
What is it?

269
00:17:49,420 --> 00:17:50,460
I want to eat.

270
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,380
Look, you're hungry, aren't you?

271
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,900
What did I just say?

272
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:56,580
Whatever happens, don't torture yourself.

273
00:17:56,580 --> 00:17:57,260
Finally starving,

274
00:17:57,260 --> 00:17:58,180
the one who suffers is oneself.

275
00:17:58,580 --> 00:17:59,220
Ayo.

276
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:00,660
I don't want to eat this.

277
00:18:02,220 --> 00:18:02,940
It's cold.

278
00:18:03,420 --> 00:18:04,420
I'll heat it up for you.

279
00:18:04,740 --> 00:18:05,260
Not stale yet.

280
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:06,980
I'll heat it up for you, okay, don't worry.

281
00:18:06,980 --> 00:18:07,740
I don't want to.

282
00:18:13,020 --> 00:18:13,540
Good.

283
00:18:17,380 --> 00:18:18,620
I'll buy you a new one.

284
00:18:20,780 --> 00:18:21,540
You wait a moment, okay?

285
00:18:39,780 --> 00:18:40,420
Senior Brother.

286
00:18:40,900 --> 00:18:41,660
Miao Miao?

287
00:18:43,140 --> 00:18:44,900
I've heard about your family.

288
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,020
If need any help,

289
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:48,740
just tell me.

290
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:50,620
I...

291
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:53,980
Hello, sir.

292
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:55,620
I'm in front of the campus gate.

293
00:18:59,780 --> 00:19:00,580
Where are you going?

294
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:01,660
I'll take you along.

295
00:19:02,140 --> 00:19:02,860
No need.

296
00:19:02,900 --> 00:19:04,980
The place I'm going to isn't far from here either.

297
00:19:04,980 --> 00:19:05,980
You just go first.

298
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:07,020
Then, I'll go first.

299
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,740
Lend me your phone for a moment.

300
00:19:34,060 --> 00:19:35,100
My cell phone is broken.

301
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:40,300
Don't be rude, yes.

302
00:19:40,420 --> 00:19:41,780
Otherwise, we will have problems.

303
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,020
Mom, it's me.

304
00:19:49,100 --> 00:19:49,900
My cell phone is broken,

305
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:51,900
I called using someone else's cell phone.

306
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:54,260
I'm going on a business trip these days.

307
00:19:56,500 --> 00:19:57,900
That's right, quite suddenly.

308
00:19:58,060 --> 00:19:59,660
There's a little trouble at my student's house.

309
00:19:59,900 --> 00:20:02,300
So, I took him home.

310
00:20:02,980 --> 00:20:03,740
Mom, just calm down,

311
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:04,860
I'll fix it after getting out of the car.

312
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:07,860
Please tell Yuze, okay?

313
00:20:07,860 --> 00:20:09,060
I won't call him again.

314
00:20:10,660 --> 00:20:13,020
Fine, fine, I understand.

315
00:20:14,540 --> 00:20:15,620
Come here first, okay?

316
00:20:15,620 --> 00:20:16,740
This is someone else's cell phone,

317
00:20:16,740 --> 00:20:17,620
can't talk much.

318
00:20:32,020 --> 00:20:33,300
Hello, Chief Hu.

319
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,100
I'm Ke.

320
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,340
Look, when it came out today,

321
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:38,660
I was hit by an electric motorbike,

322
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:39,420
So, my foot sprained.

323
00:20:40,020 --> 00:20:41,540
It's okay, it's not serious,

324
00:20:41,900 --> 00:20:43,380
it's just not free to move.

325
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:44,660
The doctor has said,

326
00:20:44,740 --> 00:20:46,060
told me to rest for a few days.

327
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:47,980
I will make a permission letter when I return to campus later.

328
00:20:49,420 --> 00:20:50,740
OK, thank you, okay?

329
00:20:50,740 --> 00:20:51,420
You are busy first.

330
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,340
See you soon.

331
00:21:06,900 --> 00:21:07,780
What is planned?

332
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:23,020
That...

333
00:21:24,060 --> 00:21:25,820
I went out to buy a few things, okay?

334
00:22:12,380 --> 00:22:13,500
Meng Hui, 'kan?

335
00:22:15,980 --> 00:22:16,740
Correct.

336
00:22:22,420 --> 00:22:23,020
Bu Ke.

337
00:22:24,060 --> 00:22:24,660
Sit down.

338
00:22:25,220 --> 00:22:27,060
You... you're okay, right?

339
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,340
It's okay, just bumped.

340
00:22:29,900 --> 00:22:30,820
My family is sick,

341
00:22:30,820 --> 00:22:31,500
I came to take care of him.

342
00:22:31,500 --> 00:22:32,540
Have you brought me the goods?

343
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:35,660
This.

344
00:22:36,060 --> 00:22:37,220
The type is according to your request.

345
00:22:37,900 --> 00:22:39,260
I bought the number with my KTP.

346
00:22:39,540 --> 00:22:40,620
The cell phone battery is also full.

347
00:22:40,620 --> 00:22:41,500
WeChat has also been downloaded.

348
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:45,100
I called you.

349
00:22:45,580 --> 00:22:48,060
Mrs. Ke, do you remember my phone number?

350
00:22:48,060 --> 00:22:48,820
No need to remember,

351
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,020
My memory for numbers is very strong.

352
00:22:51,140 --> 00:22:51,900
Check out WeChat.

353
00:22:52,420 --> 00:22:53,660
There's a new friend request, that's me.

354
00:22:53,660 --> 00:22:54,340
Add.

355
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:56,900
If there is any problem, must send WeChat message to me,

356
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,660
don't ever call me,

357
00:22:57,660 --> 00:22:58,420
do you remember?

358
00:22:58,900 --> 00:23:00,260
Remember, take it easy.

359
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:02,860
Are your wounds really okay?

360
00:23:04,140 --> 00:23:05,020
I'm fine.

361
00:23:05,540 --> 00:23:06,660
You go back and study well.

362
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:08,660
In two days I will contact you.

363
00:23:09,300 --> 00:23:10,100
Thank You.

364
00:23:10,660 --> 00:23:11,820
It's okay, that's as it should be.

365
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:14,220
I go first.

366
00:23:15,340 --> 00:23:15,900
Good.

367
00:23:26,420 --> 00:23:27,300
Initially,

368
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:30,100
I'm not on the same page as them at all,

369
00:23:30,660 --> 00:23:32,780
Also never do anything against the law.

370
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,580
It was You Qiang and the others who forced me.

371
00:23:40,020 --> 00:23:41,700
Officer Chen knew all this.

372
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:48,500
Officer Chen told me to

373
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:52,660
helped him monitor the movements of You Qiang and the others.

374
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,260
Then, he helped me

375
00:23:56,260 --> 00:23:57,700
find out the whereabouts of my biological parents.

376
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,180
I know.

377
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:03,540
It wasn't Chen who told me,

378
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:05,140
I guessed it.

379
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:09,340
He saved your number in his cell phone,

380
00:24:09,980 --> 00:24:11,540
but he never called you.

381
00:24:13,620 --> 00:24:15,260
Something happened with Chen, did you know?

382
00:24:16,540 --> 00:24:17,380
I've heard.

383
00:24:18,060 --> 00:24:19,460
Is there any information about this problem?

384
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:25,100
This is very sudden, yes.

385
00:24:26,900 --> 00:24:28,820
On the night of the incident,

386
00:24:29,980 --> 00:24:30,940
What are you doing?

387
00:24:34,460 --> 00:24:35,420
That night...

388
00:24:40,820 --> 00:24:42,260
that night, it seemed...

389
00:24:44,140 --> 00:24:45,940
was drinking with You Qiang and the others.

390
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,980
Drink where?

391
00:24:48,500 --> 00:24:49,780
Around Yanhai Road.

392
00:25:02,260 --> 00:25:05,540
It's not far from where Chen was hit, huh.

393
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:13,580
That...

394
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:15,980
Has the murderer been caught?

395
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,340
Soon.

396
00:25:19,900 --> 00:25:21,180
The scapegoat who gave himself up

397
00:25:21,180 --> 00:25:22,180
I've admitted everything.

398
00:25:22,700 --> 00:25:24,060
Just make an arrest.

399
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,260
Good.

400
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,700
I'll show you something.

401
00:25:36,860 --> 00:25:39,700
This is the person who contacted Chen on the day of the incident.

402
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,300
Do you know?

403
00:25:43,100 --> 00:25:44,460
Cukup families, 'can?

404
00:25:49,140 --> 00:25:52,980
I saw this figure... very similar to you.

405
00:26:28,580 --> 00:26:30,420
The phone call Chen answered that day...

406
00:26:31,940 --> 00:26:33,220
You're the one calling, right?

407
00:26:36,700 --> 00:26:37,940
Why did you ask him out?

408
00:26:39,020 --> 00:26:39,780
Hit him dead,

409
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:41,340
then, engineer it as an accident?

410
00:26:41,420 --> 00:26:42,180
Not me!

411
00:26:42,180 --> 00:26:43,420
Not you, then who?

412
00:26:56,460 --> 00:26:57,460
Itu Dao Jian.

413
00:27:06,380 --> 00:27:07,900
At that time I was really confused.

414
00:27:12,020 --> 00:27:13,700
There are even people who dare to kill police.

415
00:27:18,980 --> 00:27:20,540
Uncle Chen died before my eyes.

416
00:27:24,260 --> 00:27:25,340
I'm useless.

417
00:27:27,340 --> 00:27:29,180
You were also the one calling from the shop, right?

418
00:27:33,740 --> 00:27:35,140
Why does Dao Jian want to kill Chen?

419
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:36,860
Don't know, I really don't know.

420
00:27:38,940 --> 00:27:41,100
Just told me to closely monitor You Qiang's members.

421
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:42,740
He says...

422
00:27:45,500 --> 00:27:48,100
will definitely help me find the whereabouts of my biological parents.

423
00:27:51,700 --> 00:27:53,260
However, there was never any news.

424
00:27:56,060 --> 00:27:58,020
I just want to find my biological parents.

425
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:08,260
He didn't lie to you.

426
00:28:11,260 --> 00:28:13,980
This is the item Chen was carrying at the time of the incident,

427
00:28:14,100 --> 00:28:15,500
should want to hand it over to you.

428
00:28:16,660 --> 00:28:19,180
Colleagues in the police received relevant information

429
00:28:19,180 --> 00:28:20,340
about human trafficking cases

430
00:28:20,340 --> 00:28:21,260
from Tai'an at that time.

431
00:28:22,220 --> 00:28:23,740
Inside is information about your adoptive father.

432
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:27,420
This too.

433
00:28:31,820 --> 00:28:33,700
Chen's comrades in Lingbei discovered

434
00:28:34,260 --> 00:28:36,180
that the husband and wife who reported the case of missing children at that time,

435
00:28:36,180 --> 00:28:37,500
ten years ago

436
00:28:37,580 --> 00:28:39,220
has moved from Nanzhou to Lingbei.

437
00:28:39,540 --> 00:28:41,260
Therefore, can never find them.

438
00:28:42,700 --> 00:28:43,460
Then, they...

439
00:28:46,540 --> 00:28:48,020
are they still in Lingbei now?

440
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:50,900
Don't know.

441
00:28:51,740 --> 00:28:54,060
Only knew they had moved to Lingbei ten years ago.

442
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,860
Can find this information,

443
00:28:58,100 --> 00:28:59,740
Chen has already spent a lot of time.

444
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:03,740
Finding your biological parents for you,

445
00:29:04,020 --> 00:29:05,780
that is our job as police.

446
00:29:06,420 --> 00:29:07,260
This is an official duty.

447
00:29:08,420 --> 00:29:09,340
However, now,

448
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:10,860
I also think of it as

449
00:29:10,860 --> 00:29:12,420
personal business I have to do.

450
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:13,940
Also consider as

451
00:29:13,940 --> 00:29:15,020
I have important things to do.

452
00:29:31,740 --> 00:29:32,860
Have you hit a guest?

453
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,500
He acted first.

454
00:29:35,820 --> 00:29:36,900
rancid girl,

455
00:29:37,340 --> 00:29:38,740
dare to hit my guest,

456
00:29:39,060 --> 00:29:40,260
bored of life, huh?

457
00:29:46,780 --> 00:29:47,940
Boss, it's okay, right? Boss.

458
00:29:47,940 --> 00:29:48,300
Mr. Zhang.

459
00:29:48,300 --> 00:29:49,180
Chase!

460
00:29:50,140 --> 00:29:50,700
Forest, Forest.

461
00:29:50,700 --> 00:29:51,420
Fast!

462
00:29:51,700 --> 00:29:52,180
Don't go!

463
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,020
Stop!

464
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,180
let me go!

465
00:29:55,180 --> 00:29:55,660
Road!

466
00:29:55,660 --> 00:29:56,500
let me go!

467
00:29:56,980 --> 00:29:58,140
Tie him up!

468
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:01,740
Halo.

469
00:30:02,580 --> 00:30:03,060
Halo.

470
00:30:07,780 --> 00:30:09,180
How Zhong?

471
00:30:09,940 --> 00:30:11,540
I send you to the afterlife.

472
00:30:20,180 --> 00:30:20,700
Halo.

473
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:21,220
Kapten Xiao.

474
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:22,540
Miao Miao ditangkap oleh Dao Jian.

475
00:30:22,900 --> 00:30:23,740
Miao Miao?

476
00:30:31,020 --> 00:30:32,260
Do you know where Dao Jian is?

477
00:30:33,220 --> 00:30:33,820
Jujinxiao.

478
00:30:33,820 --> 00:30:34,700
Quickly take me to look for them.

479
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,100
Miao Miao was captured by them.

480
00:30:36,180 --> 00:30:36,820
Miao Miao?

481
00:30:37,100 --> 00:30:38,180
Princess Chen.

482
00:30:40,700 --> 00:30:41,340
Follow me.

483
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:42,180
Wait a minute.

484
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:43,580
The two of us can't go together.

485
00:30:43,580 --> 00:30:44,820
Then, I'll go alone.

486
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:45,860
We move apart.

487
00:30:45,980 --> 00:30:46,580
Good.

488
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,740
Meng Hui!

489
00:30:51,780 --> 00:30:53,860
Chen only has one daughter.

490
00:30:54,540 --> 00:30:55,340
Stay cool,

491
00:30:56,620 --> 00:30:57,340
Kapten Xiao.

492
00:31:01,780 --> 00:31:02,580
Don't mess around!

493
00:31:09,860 --> 00:31:10,500
Get out.

494
00:31:10,580 --> 00:31:11,060
What?

495
00:31:11,700 --> 00:31:12,860
I told you to get out!

496
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,020
You're out too.

497
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:27,580
Tired of living, huh?

498
00:31:27,740 --> 00:31:28,500
Bastard.

499
00:31:29,420 --> 00:31:30,140
Why?

500
00:31:30,660 --> 00:31:32,300
You... you still want to kill me?

501
00:31:33,940 --> 00:31:35,740
Well, don't be afraid.

502
00:31:37,340 --> 00:31:41,660
I like straightforward little girls like you.

503
00:32:07,500 --> 00:32:08,340
Bos!

504
00:32:12,020 --> 00:32:13,220
Mr. Chen can't wait,

505
00:32:13,220 --> 00:32:13,820
he's looking for you.

506
00:32:38,220 --> 00:32:38,900
Kapten Xiao,

507
00:32:38,900 --> 00:32:40,620
there was a traffic accident in front of us

508
00:32:40,620 --> 00:32:41,620
and hinder us.

509
00:32:43,260 --> 00:32:43,780
Good.

510
00:32:48,020 --> 00:32:50,420
Hello, is it Lu Liang from the Third Squadron?

511
00:32:51,540 --> 00:32:52,900
There is a problem that needs your help.

512
00:33:25,660 --> 00:33:26,500
Little girl,

513
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,340
pretty cool too, yeah.

514
00:33:30,260 --> 00:33:31,140
Let go.

515
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:48,140
Do you have any other talents?

516
00:33:57,460 --> 00:33:58,460
Is there a problem?

517
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:02,020
Boss, the police came to the hospital,

518
00:34:02,020 --> 00:34:04,260
was checking the rooms one by one.

519
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:05,940
What is this?

520
00:34:06,580 --> 00:34:08,300
Where do I know what happened?

521
00:34:08,500 --> 00:34:10,020
Could it be that you came because of us?

522
00:34:10,500 --> 00:34:12,180
If you check up to our room,

523
00:34:12,340 --> 00:34:13,580
and this woman said she was beaten by you,

524
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,500
then it's over.

525
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,660
Is he brave?

526
00:34:24,060 --> 00:34:25,340
Police, what's wrong?

527
00:34:25,340 --> 00:34:26,100
Routine police checks,

528
00:34:26,180 --> 00:34:27,980
If you interfere with the inspection, do so at your own risk.

529
00:34:28,700 --> 00:34:29,180
Mr Police.

530
00:34:34,860 --> 00:34:37,820
(Incoming call; Mysterious Person)

531
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:44,420
This brother,

532
00:34:45,180 --> 00:34:46,900
I've been to the hospital.

533
00:34:50,460 --> 00:34:53,300
The woman lay almost dead there,

534
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:54,660
absolutely no pretense.

535
00:34:55,380 --> 00:34:56,260
Stay cool.

536
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,780
Boss, the police... the police are coming!

537
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:00,620
Do not move! Police!

538
00:35:00,700 --> 00:35:01,620
Raise your hand!

539
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,460
What... what happened?

540
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,860
Quick, quickly put on the clothes.

541
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,500
Zhong!

542
00:35:16,060 --> 00:35:17,220
Police beat people,

543
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:18,700
I want to meet my lawyer!

544
00:35:18,980 --> 00:35:19,740
On what basis to arrest me?

545
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:21,380
On what basis to arrest me?

546
00:35:25,540 --> 00:35:26,220
It's okay.

547
00:35:29,740 --> 00:35:30,380
Before we came,

548
00:35:30,380 --> 00:35:31,460
is someone coming to save you?

549
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,220
Nobody came?

550
00:35:43,700 --> 00:35:44,380
Ayo.

551
00:36:08,540 --> 00:36:11,460
(The woman lay almost dead there,)

552
00:36:11,540 --> 00:36:12,820
(really not pretending.)

553
00:36:12,900 --> 00:36:15,380
(Boss, police... the police are coming!)

554
00:36:34,020 --> 00:36:34,540
Enter.

555
00:36:35,980 --> 00:36:36,500
Enter.

556
00:36:46,260 --> 00:36:46,860
Halo.

557
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:48,540
Where have you been?

558
00:36:49,140 --> 00:36:50,340
I went out to buy a pack of cigarettes.

559
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:51,860
What is it? Is there any problem?

560
00:36:52,660 --> 00:36:53,700
Buy me a pack of bandages.

561
00:36:53,900 --> 00:36:55,380
What did you say? What do you buy?

562
00:36:56,940 --> 00:36:57,820
Bandage.

563
00:36:59,340 --> 00:36:59,980
I know.

564
00:37:07,860 --> 00:37:08,540
Drink it.

565
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:23,820
Miao Miao.

566
00:37:24,980 --> 00:37:25,980
Have you ever thought,

567
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:28,500
if your father were still alive,

568
00:37:29,220 --> 00:37:31,820
how will he judge your rash actions today?

569
00:37:32,660 --> 00:37:34,180
However, my father has already died.

570
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:41,860
Miao Miao.

571
00:37:43,540 --> 00:37:44,780
Regarding your father's problem,

572
00:37:45,660 --> 00:37:46,980
the police have their own regulations,

573
00:37:47,780 --> 00:37:48,700
You don't add to the problem.

574
00:37:49,780 --> 00:37:51,020
Do you know in order to save you today,

575
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:52,340
already messed up how many plans

576
00:37:52,340 --> 00:37:53,180
and police arrangements?

577
00:37:55,980 --> 00:37:57,020
What plan?

578
00:37:57,420 --> 00:37:58,380
What settings?

579
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:01,260
Isn't it just looking for two people to follow Dao Jian?

580
00:38:03,220 --> 00:38:04,100
What's the result?

581
00:38:04,980 --> 00:38:06,660
Have you found any evidence that he harmed my father?

582
00:38:06,980 --> 00:38:07,980
This is not something you need to deal with.

583
00:38:07,980 --> 00:38:08,980
Of course I have to take care of it,

584
00:38:09,340 --> 00:38:11,220
because you guys don't take my father seriously at all!

585
00:38:26,100 --> 00:38:26,740
Miao Miao.

586
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:30,940
Your father is not only my comrade in arms,

587
00:38:32,300 --> 00:38:33,740
but also my sister.

588
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:35,980
Not just me,

589
00:38:36,980 --> 00:38:39,940
all the colleagues in the team respected him very much.

590
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:41,980
Regarding his death,

591
00:38:41,980 --> 00:38:44,660
each of us felt very sad, I...

592
00:38:44,660 --> 00:38:45,420
Lie!

593
00:38:49,220 --> 00:38:50,500
You all don't care at all

594
00:38:50,500 --> 00:38:51,660
with my father's life and death.

595
00:38:52,420 --> 00:38:53,820
He died, yes, died.

596
00:38:54,540 --> 00:38:56,020
You guys held a funeral for him,

597
00:38:56,020 --> 00:38:57,660
pretending in front of the boss,

598
00:38:57,980 --> 00:38:59,300
then, come to my house pretending

599
00:38:59,300 --> 00:39:00,020
show condolences,

600
00:39:00,020 --> 00:39:00,900
and it's done.

601
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:01,820
What about next?

602
00:39:02,820 --> 00:39:04,220
Did my father die tragically?

603
00:39:05,140 --> 00:39:07,500
In your eyes he is an old policeman,

604
00:39:07,980 --> 00:39:09,820
maybe being alive also caused problems for you.

605
00:39:10,340 --> 00:39:12,620
Now it's good, the problems have decreased.

606
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:15,180
However, I am different, he is my father.

607
00:39:15,220 --> 00:39:16,460
I only have one father.

608
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:18,220
He died unclearly,

609
00:39:18,220 --> 00:39:19,820
even though it cost me my life, I also want revenge for him!

610
00:39:19,820 --> 00:39:20,460
You...

611
00:39:22,380 --> 00:39:23,020
Sit down.

612
00:39:36,780 --> 00:39:37,940
If you were my daughter,

613
00:39:37,980 --> 00:39:39,460
I've been hitting you for a long time!

614
00:39:40,380 --> 00:39:41,900
Luckily you're not my daughter.

615
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:49,660
Halo.

616
00:39:51,220 --> 00:39:52,180
I understand.

617
00:39:52,220 --> 00:39:53,220
I'll be right there.

618
00:40:00,380 --> 00:40:01,860
Later Xing Wei will take you back to campus,

619
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:04,660
study well and take good care of your grandmother.

620
00:40:04,980 --> 00:40:06,180
If you cause trouble again,

621
00:40:06,220 --> 00:40:07,620
I will represent your father to hit you!

622
00:40:16,060 --> 00:40:20,140

628
00:41:15,380 --> 00:41:16,700
Halo, Zhou Jing.

629
00:41:17,860 --> 00:41:19,260
I have a problem I want to ask for your help.

630
00:41:19,940 --> 00:41:21,340
My cousin's sister had a car accident,

631
00:41:21,500 --> 00:41:22,860
his face was badly injured.

632
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:25,700
I want to help her find a plastic surgeon.

633
00:41:26,380 --> 00:41:29,660
I heard, there are people who have plastic surgery in Barcelona.

634
00:41:54,460 --> 00:41:55,140
Xing Wei,

635
00:41:55,340 --> 00:41:56,660
Is the statement from the person inside finished?

636
00:41:57,140 --> 00:41:57,940
It's finished.

637
00:41:58,020 --> 00:41:59,540
For managers, more must still be added.

638
00:41:59,940 --> 00:42:01,660
The murder weapon in the Chong Haifeng case has still not been found,

639
00:42:02,100 --> 00:42:03,420
still need to be checked again.

640
00:42:03,740 --> 00:42:04,620
Just ask Sis Zhang to accompany you there.

641
00:42:04,620 --> 00:42:05,500
You go with me.

642
00:42:05,660 --> 00:42:06,180
Good.

643
00:42:26,820 --> 00:42:28,140
June this year.

644
00:42:28,940 --> 00:42:32,100
Before June, maybe around April or May.

645
00:42:32,740 --> 00:42:33,580
major surgery,

646
00:42:33,860 --> 00:42:35,380
there should be records that can be checked.

647
00:42:50,060 --> 00:42:50,860
I...

648
00:42:53,060 --> 00:42:54,140
There was a little problem,

649
00:42:54,380 --> 00:42:57,460
looks like our game will end early.

650
00:43:01,700 --> 00:43:02,500
What are you doing?

651
00:43:05,740 --> 00:43:06,340
It is okay, right?

652
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:11,140

I'm a policeman,
