=Episode 12=

3
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,480
How?

4
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,200
Do you understand?

5
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:51,640
Already.

6
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,440
Go there and see again.

7
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:52,720
Good.

8
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:53,520
Let's go see what's there.

9
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:53,960
Good.

10
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:55,240
Also check at the top there.

11
00:01:55,480 --> 00:01:55,960
Good.

12
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:01,400
You have to check there too.

13
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:02,040
See what you can find.

14
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:02,760
- Check more carefully. - Good.

15
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:04,200
How is that there?

16
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,040
Didn't find anything.

17
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:27,400
Good.

18
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:29,360
That's it, go.

19
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:30,200
Good.

20
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:34,360
- Kapten Xiao. - Kapten Xiao.

21
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,400
Let's go.

22
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:52,680
Ready.

23
00:02:56,440 --> 00:02:57,040
Sit down.

24
00:02:58,040 --> 00:02:59,280
I just want to have fun with you guys.

25
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,040
Whether you mind or not.

26
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:02,720
Don't mind, don't mind.

27
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:03,720
Mr. Feng, please,

28
00:03:04,040 --> 00:03:04,680
please, please.

29
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,880
I don't smoke, thank you.

30
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:09,640
It's okay, Brother Qiang.

31
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,360
Mr. Feng doesn't mind if other people smoke.

32
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:13,200
You don't mind.

33
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:16,280
Mr. Feng,

34
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:17,320
please drink the beer.

35
00:03:19,240 --> 00:03:20,040
I always listen to Wu

36
00:03:20,040 --> 00:03:21,200
tell about Kak Qiang,

37
00:03:21,480 --> 00:03:22,640
finally had the chance to meet.

38
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,200
Come on, have a beer.

39
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,560
Come on, come on.

40
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:28,040
Cheers, Mr. Feng.

41
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:42,400
Come on, try it.

42
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,400
I haven't cooked in a long time.

43
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:45,000
My cooking skills are a little stiff.

44
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:48,320
Where are Mr. Feng's chopsticks?

45
00:03:57,400 --> 00:03:58,400
Wu, Wu.

46
00:03:58,520 --> 00:03:59,080
Good.

47
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:02,160
Try it.

48
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,280
You first, you first.

49
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:42,720
You don't have a night shift today, right?

50
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:47,080
Ying Ying.

51
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,600
I think we need to talk.

52
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,720
Talking about what?

53
00:04:55,720 --> 00:04:57,280
Very serious.

54
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,000
What is this actually?

55
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:10,840
Like I told you.

56
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,800
You're suspicious

57
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:26,120
Shen Shijie menyamar sebagai Feng Xiaosheng.

58
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
Suspect he has accomplices in the police.

59
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:30,560
So,

60
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,280
you deliberately avoided the city police station,

61
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:34,960
and report them to the provincial police, right?

62
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,920
Correct.

63
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:43,960
The results prove it

64
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:45,960
that your guess is wrong.

65
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:47,840
Feng Xiaosheng

66
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:50,080
sama sekali bukan Shen Shijie.

67
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,280
They also have no accomplices in the police,

68
00:05:54,040 --> 00:05:54,680
Correct?

69
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:00,720
Correct.

70
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:04,400
Then, why you

71
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,080
didn't tell me earlier?

72
00:06:08,480 --> 00:06:09,280
Because...

73
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:12,480
I'm afraid you'll stop me.

74
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:17,480
I'm afraid you'll think of me as crazy.

75
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:22,080
Now it's proven

76
00:06:24,640 --> 00:06:26,480
I'm crazy.

77
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:28,560
I might

78
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:31,000
have a mental disorder.

79
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:35,640
I... I might really be crazy.

80
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:39,200
I... I might really...

81
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:42,920
Sorry, sorry.

82
00:06:42,920 --> 00:06:43,680
Sorry.

83
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:44,760
It is my fault.

84
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:46,160
It's okay, it's okay.

85
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:47,720
You don't have a mental disorder.

86
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:48,840
You're not crazy at all.

87
00:06:49,480 --> 00:06:51,000
Sorry, I'm not good enough.

88
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,720
Sorry, nothing to do with you.

89
00:06:53,240 --> 00:06:54,320
Sorry.

90
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,280
It doesn't matter.

91
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:06,400
Mr. Feng.

92
00:07:06,520 --> 00:07:08,600
I'll drink first, you can do whatever you can.

93
00:07:09,760 --> 00:07:10,320
Cheers!

94
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,400
I'll finish first.

95
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:13,440
Spend it!

96
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:14,480
- Spend it! - Drink, drink!

97
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:16,640
Good, good!

98
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:17,600
Good!

99
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:23,440
Add more, add more.

100
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:24,720
Come on, come on, add more!

101
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,000
That's enough, that's enough.

102
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:27,840
I have some business to go first.

103
00:07:39,920 --> 00:07:40,920
Today is really fun.

104
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:43,600
I go first.

105
00:07:44,440 --> 00:07:44,720
Mr. Feng.

106
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:46,480
Be careful on the road, Mr. Feng.

107
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:49,440
Be careful on the road, Mr. Feng!

108
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:55,400
Kapten Xiao.

109
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,480
Cao Liang has been arrested.

110
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,880
I didn't break the law.

111
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:10,320
On what basis did you arrest me?

112
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:12,720
He is really my boyfriend.

113
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,920
We are both ready.

114
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:16,120
He was caught on the bed,

115
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:18,120
is flirting with women.

116
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:21,840
Cash amounting to 500 thousand yuan was found in the room.

117
00:08:22,920 --> 00:08:24,240
How about you ask me

118
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:25,800
his cell phone number and WeChat account?

119
00:08:26,480 --> 00:08:29,040
Even the one registered on Alipay is my bank card.

120
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:31,600
I didn't ask that.

121
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:34,920
I also didn't commit any other crimes.

122
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,160
Explain

123
00:08:38,160 --> 00:08:39,600
problem between you and Zhang Zhigao.

124
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:43,720
What... what is Zhang Zhigao?

125
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:46,480
What do I do with it?

126
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:48,120
What do you think you do with it?

127
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:49,920
What about the money in the fishing village yard?

128
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:51,120
Moved to where?

129
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:54,200
Money... what money?

130
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,080
I don't know what you're talking about.

131
00:08:56,280 --> 00:08:57,400
These two days off,

132
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:58,320
I accompanied my girlfriend.

133
00:08:58,840 --> 00:08:59,880
I don't go to clubs.

134
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:01,480
I didn't see Dao Jian either.

135
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,160
I won't talk too much nonsense with you.

136
00:09:11,960 --> 00:09:13,520
Dao Jian has been killed.

137
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:15,440
What do you think they are

138
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,400
will let you go?

139
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:36,920
It's really not me who stole the money!

140
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,080
Pelakunya Dao Jian.

141
00:09:40,760 --> 00:09:42,320
He wanted to escape.

142
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:44,000
So, he used all means

143
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,120
to steal the money.

144
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:47,560
He gave me 500 thousand yuan,

145
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:49,240
tell me to hide

146
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:50,920
and pretend not to know anything.

147
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:54,320
What I said is all true!

148
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:09,800
Continue.

149
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:18,120
Zhong.

150
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:19,360
Investigate immediately

151
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:21,400
all of Zhang Zhigao's call history these past two months.

152
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:23,440
Especially the few days before and after Chen's death.

153
00:10:23,520 --> 00:10:25,440
Look at the numbers of anyone he has contacted.

154
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:26,320
Investigate them one by one.

155
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:27,680
OK, I understand, I'll do it immediately.

156
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:30,560
Zhang Peng.

157
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:32,320
Try checking again

158
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:34,120
all of Shen Shijie's social interactions.

159
00:10:35,080 --> 00:10:36,320
I've investigated it before.

160
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:37,880
Shen Shijie is an orphan.

161
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:40,240
Apart from some of his thug friends,

162
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:42,600
he had almost no contact with other people.

163
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:44,600
Investigate again carefully.

164
00:10:44,680 --> 00:10:46,560
Even the smallest detail should not be missed.

165
00:10:47,880 --> 00:10:48,680
Understand.

166
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:01,080
(Understanding everything about Shen Shijie.)

167
00:11:02,360 --> 00:11:04,320
(Dao Jian's weakness is within his grasp.)

168
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:06,440
(Could corner him into killing the cops.)

169
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:20,360
Who exactly?

170
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:30,800
Who?

171
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:32,560
Brother-in-law, I'm Wu.

172
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:33,480
Who?

173
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,000
Wu.

174
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:39,760
Sister-in-law.

175
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,720
Why are you drinking like this again?

176
00:11:41,840 --> 00:11:42,640
Are you drinking again?

177
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:46,320
All day your work is just drinking.

178
00:11:48,920 --> 00:11:50,360
Why are you drinking again?

179
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:52,640
Why do you have so much nonsense?

180
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:55,040
I'll tell you.

181
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:56,360
Wu.

182
00:11:58,120 --> 00:11:58,800
Wu.

183
00:11:59,640 --> 00:12:02,200
Family must act like family.

184
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:02,440
Correct.

185
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:03,440
Got it, right?

186
00:12:03,520 --> 00:12:04,480
Soon something like this will happen

187
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:06,240
have to learn from me.

188
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:07,120
Of.

189
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:08,640
Study.

190
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,160
Why are you still standing here?

191
00:12:18,840 --> 00:12:19,640
Go make tea.

192
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:20,520
What else do you want to chat about?

193
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:21,720
Hurry up and take a shower and sleep!

194
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:22,880
Truly.

195
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:24,760
Sister-in-law, don't be angry.

196
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,560
Sis Qiang, it's late at night.

197
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:27,920
I have to go home, we'll talk another day.

198
00:12:28,040 --> 00:12:29,000
I don't want to disturb your rest.

199
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:29,440
Wait.

200
00:12:29,720 --> 00:12:30,560
What's so late at night?

201
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,800
What time is it now?

202
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,120
03.00.

203
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:38,320
Nope.

204
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:46,920
Didn't I tell you to?

205
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:49,360
Go make some tea!

206
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:50,720
Base!

207
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:52,640
Sister-in-law, don't be angry.

208
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,600
Don't be mad, yes.

209
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:55,040
Don't calculate with Sis Qiang.

210
00:12:57,360 --> 00:12:59,120
Sis Qiang, rest early.

211
00:12:59,720 --> 00:13:00,200
Don't offend...

212
00:13:00,200 --> 00:13:01,640
I... I'll go first, it's too late.

213
00:13:01,640 --> 00:13:02,640
Back, back.

214
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:04,240
Sit down, sit down.

215
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,800
Wu.

216
00:13:14,400 --> 00:13:16,360
Don't blame me for being cruel.

217
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,040
I'm helping you.

218
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:23,240
Help me?

219
00:13:24,600 --> 00:13:25,240
Correct.

220
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:27,200
help you

221
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:33,160
Co... try to think about it again.

222
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:37,120
Correct.

223
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,440
It really helped me.

224
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:40,320
Not this time

225
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:42,920
You clear me of suspicion?

226
00:13:45,320 --> 00:13:46,960
Tricks to seek enemy sympathy.

227
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:48,560
Correct.

228
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:52,920
You're pretty smart too.

229
00:13:54,960 --> 00:13:56,160
You can understand it quickly.

230
00:13:57,400 --> 00:13:58,800
Sis Qiang taught me very well.

231
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:00,880
It's good to understand.

232
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,600
Don't be arrogant, can't be arrogant!

233
00:14:05,280 --> 00:14:06,080
I've remembered.

234
00:14:08,520 --> 00:14:09,680
I'll tell you.

235
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:11,600
Masalah Dao Jian...

236
00:14:13,840 --> 00:14:15,360
Dao Jian,

237
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:18,080
greedy and cruel, his guts are also big.

238
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,680
However, try to remember the past.

239
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:26,040
He has done so much

240
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,240
evil deeds

241
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:31,440
He will not end well.

242
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:33,160
Th... it won't end well.

243
00:14:41,000 --> 00:14:42,360
I told you that time,

244
00:14:42,400 --> 00:14:45,040
keep your distance from Dao Jian.

245
00:14:45,960 --> 00:14:48,240
It's not good to be too close, right?

246
00:14:48,760 --> 00:14:49,440
Correct.

247
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:52,560
However, it's still not bad, you've had good luck.

248
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,080
You are favored by Mr. Feng.

249
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,280
Mr. Feng was not a normal person.

250
00:15:00,960 --> 00:15:02,520
In... he's a normal person.

251
00:15:02,960 --> 00:15:03,880
He is not an ordinary person.

252
00:15:05,200 --> 00:15:08,080
True, true, not ordinary people.

253
00:15:16,840 --> 00:15:18,080
Have you finished breaking things?

254
00:15:19,560 --> 00:15:21,840
You came here to vent your anger.

255
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,200
Why not go find it

256
00:15:23,200 --> 00:15:24,440
your seductive woman?

257
00:15:24,600 --> 00:15:26,000
How good they are.

258
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:28,520
Everyone is so loving.

259
00:15:36,760 --> 00:15:38,080
Tell Ruichi to go home.

260
00:15:41,240 --> 00:15:42,160
Call Ruichi,

261
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:43,440
tell him to hurry home.

262
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,720
If you want to send Ruichi home,

263
00:15:45,960 --> 00:15:47,560
I also have to tell my sister.

264
00:15:47,640 --> 00:15:48,440
Ruichi already said,

265
00:15:48,640 --> 00:15:50,360
the older brother who wouldn't let him come back.

266
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,640
If so, don't tell your sister.

267
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,200
Just tell Ruichi to go home straight away.

268
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,840
What is it? Why?

269
00:16:03,120 --> 00:16:04,280
If I told you, you wouldn't understand either.

270
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:05,560
I told you to call, yes, just call.

271
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,520
My sister is neither deaf nor blind.

272
00:16:08,520 --> 00:16:09,120
What he will not know

273
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:10,240
if Ruichi comes back?

274
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,000
You just say,

275
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,000
I hit you

276
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,000
and wants to divorce you.

277
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,120
You've gone crazy, haven't you?

278
00:16:18,760 --> 00:16:20,640
You said it very frankly,

279
00:16:20,640 --> 00:16:21,400
Oh, I see?

280
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:22,760
Aren't you afraid I'll put in

281
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,760
rat poison in your drinking water?

282
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:25,400
I I...

283
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,760
just helps you find an excuse.

284
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,000
That's just an example, not really.

285
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:33,640
If Ruichi doesn't come home,

286
00:16:33,640 --> 00:16:35,080
then I really will lose everything.

287
00:16:36,360 --> 00:16:37,720
If I really were homeless,

288
00:16:37,720 --> 00:16:39,000
do you still want to live with me?

289
00:16:39,760 --> 00:16:40,840
Later, never mind me,

290
00:16:40,840 --> 00:16:42,360
You might be the first to file for divorce.

291
00:17:09,440 --> 00:17:10,880
Why are you coming home so early?

292
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:13,080
Didn't you previously say you'd come home at the end of the year?

293
00:17:13,160 --> 00:17:14,760
I miss you too much.

294
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,600
I miss you so much I can't sleep.

295
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,160
So, I bought a plane ticket and went home.

296
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:21,160
I don't believe it.

297
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,160
You can't lie to me.

298
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:23,840
It's up to you to believe it or not.

299
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:38,760
I emphasize once again.

300
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:42,280
This forum is international,

301
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:44,120
the influence is very significant.

302
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:46,480
You guys are not the only ones there

303
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:48,000
representing Nanjing University,

304
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,600
but also represents the city,

305
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:51,720
province,

306
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:52,880
and our country.

307
00:17:53,880 --> 00:17:55,760
There can be no mistake.

308
00:17:56,600 --> 00:17:58,560
Especially the teacher who leads the team.

309
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:00,560
You have to be responsible.

310
00:18:01,040 --> 00:18:02,880
Whose students have problems,

311
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:04,600
I will look for him.

312
00:18:22,800 --> 00:18:23,440
Excuse me,

313
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:25,800
are you Yu Chengbo's mother?

314
00:18:27,080 --> 00:18:28,320
Are you Mrs. Ke?

315
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:36,300
(Famous Flagship Universities)

316
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:39,600
No matter how I ask, he won't say.

317
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,560
If you keep asking,

318
00:18:42,040 --> 00:18:43,560
he will lock himself in his room,

319
00:18:43,560 --> 00:18:44,400
don't want to meet anyone.

320
00:18:46,040 --> 00:18:47,080
We are Cheng Cheng

321
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:49,520
never caused a problem.

322
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,720
How can someone hit him?

323
00:18:51,720 --> 00:18:52,560
up to that?

324
00:18:55,000 --> 00:18:55,920
Bu Ke.

325
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,600
I didn't come to look for trouble with the campus.

326
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,480
I just wanted to know,

327
00:19:05,560 --> 00:19:06,800
actually

328
00:19:07,720 --> 00:19:09,360
what happened to my son?

329
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,360
Mrs. Yu, don't panic yet.

330
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:17,080
Let's sit here and talk about it.

331
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:25,000
Regarding this problem,

332
00:19:25,800 --> 00:19:27,400
I will definitely give you an explanation.

333
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,440
Oh yes.

334
00:19:34,120 --> 00:19:34,920
Mother Yu.

335
00:19:35,720 --> 00:19:36,760
This money

336
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:37,880
is a donation

337
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,120
from his friends Yu Chengbo.

338
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:39,720
Accept it.

339
00:19:39,720 --> 00:19:40,400
No, no.

340
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:40,960
No.

341
00:19:41,520 --> 00:19:42,840
I'm not here to ask for money.

342
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:44,640
I can't accept this money.

343
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:46,600
You just accept it.

344
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,520
This is the good intention of his friends.

345
00:19:51,040 --> 00:19:52,600
Kondisi Yu Chengbo sekarang

346
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:55,840
may require psychiatric intervention.

347
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:58,360
If you don't find a good doctor,

348
00:19:58,360 --> 00:20:00,120
I can recommend it, the costs are paid by me.

349
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,200
You don't need to worry

350
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:05,320
about campus.

351
00:20:05,920 --> 00:20:08,040
I'll help him get sick leave.

352
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:09,600
Let's see what the condition is first.

353
00:20:11,200 --> 00:20:12,480
If you still can't,

354
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,360
We are asking for half a year off from college.

355
00:20:20,960 --> 00:20:22,600
This is all my fault.

356
00:20:24,560 --> 00:20:25,720
Cannot look after students well.

357
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:27,400
After coming home,

358
00:20:28,080 --> 00:20:29,480
send me your account number.

359
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:32,280
The Yu Chengbo Scholarship is about to come out.

360
00:20:32,360 --> 00:20:33,400
I'll transfer it to you later.

361
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:37,080
Be... scholarship?

362
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,600
What scholarship?

363
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,240
Award from the educational foundation

364
00:20:45,280 --> 00:20:46,800
especially for high achieving students.

365
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,880
I submitted it to Yu Chengbo.

366
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:54,720
Thank you, Mrs. Ke.

367
00:21:03,320 --> 00:21:04,920
Zhang Zhigao had two phone numbers.

368
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,480
His call history is extensive.

369
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:07,840
Among them,

370
00:21:07,840 --> 00:21:08,560
most of them are

371
00:21:08,560 --> 00:21:09,600
guests who go to his club.

372
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,720
We have checked them one by one.

373
00:21:10,840 --> 00:21:12,280
Most are connected.

374
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:15,000
However, there are three that are inactive

375
00:21:15,040 --> 00:21:16,040
and two that are not listed.

376
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:17,640
Additionally, there are several

377
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:18,760
a call from a telemarketer.

378
00:21:18,840 --> 00:21:19,840
However, inside here,

379
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:21,720
there are three numbers that are very suspicious.

380
00:21:21,720 --> 00:21:23,920
A kind of virtual telephone number.

381
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:25,200
Every number

382
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:26,320
only used for about a week

383
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:27,280
then not used again.

384
00:21:30,120 --> 00:21:31,080
It must be this guy.

385
00:21:34,040 --> 00:21:35,640
When Inspector Chen had an accident,

386
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:36,760
Zhang Zhigao

387
00:21:36,760 --> 00:21:38,520
very often contact the second

388
00:21:38,560 --> 00:21:39,760
of these three numbers.

389
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:43,920
Is Zhang Zhigao's cell phone still not found?

390
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:44,960
Not yet.

391
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:48,800
What are the results of your investigation?

392
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:50,200
I've investigated

393
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,400
semua data-data Shen Shijie.

394
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:54,320
He was already a thug before he even graduated from middle school.

395
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:56,960
Then, he was recruited to be Feng Meng's subordinate.

396
00:21:57,680 --> 00:21:58,840
With dexterity

397
00:21:58,920 --> 00:21:59,880
and his cruelty,

398
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,680
he got the support of Feng Meng,

399
00:22:01,800 --> 00:22:03,560
become the number one thug.

400
00:22:03,840 --> 00:22:04,960
Those close to him

401
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:05,920
there were only three people

402
00:22:06,760 --> 00:22:09,080
yaitu Shou Gou, Lao Hu, dan Dao Jian.

403
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:11,560
The one called You Qiang,

404
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:13,200
only responsible for lending money at the gambling place.

405
00:22:14,920 --> 00:22:15,720
Dengan Shen Shijie,

406
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,440
you could say you just know him.

407
00:22:17,800 --> 00:22:18,840
Not a close friend at all.

408
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:21,640
No other social interactions?

409
00:22:23,680 --> 00:22:24,600
He is an orphan.

410
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:26,800
He grew up in an orphanage from childhood.

411
00:22:27,160 --> 00:22:28,400
There are no relatives and friends.

412
00:22:29,160 --> 00:22:29,960
As soon as he died,

413
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:32,440
almost no one remembers it anymore.

414
00:23:23,640 --> 00:23:25,200
What are you drawing?

415
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:28,200
The essence is similar to this.

416
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,080
It looks similar to a pendant.

417
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:31,280
I don't know where to press it

418
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:33,080
very sharp needles can appear.

419
00:23:33,080 --> 00:23:34,040
Last time,

420
00:23:34,040 --> 00:23:35,280
My neck was almost pierced.

421
00:23:45,800 --> 00:23:47,000
Based on your words,

422
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:48,240
this thing you drew

423
00:23:48,240 --> 00:23:49,640
basically a match for a murder weapon

424
00:23:50,560 --> 00:23:51,760
who killed Lao Hu.

425
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,920
Plus the time he left.

426
00:23:56,840 --> 00:23:58,920
Feng Xiaosheng is so rich,

427
00:23:59,520 --> 00:24:01,040
billionaire status.

428
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:04,440
Why could he care so much about this little money?

429
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,280
Based on the status,

430
00:24:07,920 --> 00:24:09,840
why does he want to do it himself,

431
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:11,600
and didn't tell second uncle?

432
00:24:13,560 --> 00:24:14,200
Besides that,

433
00:24:16,200 --> 00:24:18,120
he smashed his face and cut his hands.

434
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:20,760
How big is the revenge and hatred?

435
00:24:23,440 --> 00:24:24,120
This is not true.

436
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,120
Kapten Xiao.

437
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,280
I feel people

438
00:24:29,280 --> 00:24:30,320
like this Feng Xiaosheng

439
00:24:31,400 --> 00:24:32,680
very complicated.

440
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:33,880
Try explaining.

441
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:38,440
It's hard to explain.

442
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:40,880
For example,

443
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:42,920
Feng Xiaosheng

444
00:24:42,920 --> 00:24:44,200
and that woman named Ke Xiaowen.

445
00:24:45,600 --> 00:24:47,320
What do you think is the relationship between the two of them?

446
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:50,840
I saw with my own eyes

447
00:24:50,840 --> 00:24:51,800
he almost strangled him to death.

448
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,800
I just rushed to help him.

449
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:54,360
Finally?

450
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,280
These two people treated it like nothing had happened.

451
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,560
What kind of relationship do you think they have?

452
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:02,800
Besides that,

453
00:25:03,560 --> 00:25:05,000
rich boss

454
00:25:05,320 --> 00:25:06,560
seperti Feng Xiaosheng,

455
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:07,760
logically,

456
00:25:07,760 --> 00:25:08,800
usually behave politely,

457
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:09,360
True, or not?

458
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:11,440
However, this person is different.

459
00:25:11,920 --> 00:25:13,680
Speech, behavior, and the look in his eyes,

460
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:15,000
much like a professional killer

461
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:16,560
the ones in the movies.

462
00:25:16,760 --> 00:25:17,320
Really.

463
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:22,600
Even Dao Jian was afraid of him.

464
00:25:23,520 --> 00:25:24,920
He was much more afraid than the second uncle.

465
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:26,680
Meeting him was like meeting a ghost.

466
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:28,280
This really makes...

467
00:25:28,680 --> 00:25:30,120
Then, what do you think?

468
00:25:33,000 --> 00:25:35,080
I've been in contact with him lately...

469
00:25:36,800 --> 00:25:38,800
I feel like he's not what he looks like.

470
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:42,080
You could say it like this...

471
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:45,880
I feel like he's not himself.

472
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:55,800
Oh, ya, Kapten Xiao.

473
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:57,800
Has Kun been found?

474
00:25:58,560 --> 00:25:59,360
Already.

475
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:00,320
Already dead.

476
00:26:02,040 --> 00:26:03,600
Apart from that, the bakcang shop owner

477
00:26:03,680 --> 00:26:04,680
also disappeared.

478
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:06,280
Disappear?

479
00:26:07,680 --> 00:26:09,280
This is definitely not a coincidence.

480
00:26:12,680 --> 00:26:13,840
The previous owner of the building,

481
00:26:15,080 --> 00:26:16,520
always go to work.

482
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,280
One day received

483
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,800
call from the owner of this shop.

484
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,280
He said he had business in his hometown,

485
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:22,000
So, I don't want to work anymore.

486
00:26:23,040 --> 00:26:25,440
He even forfeited the half-year deposit he had paid.

487
00:26:26,680 --> 00:26:27,360
Then the owner of this building

488
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:28,920
returning from a business trip.

489
00:26:28,920 --> 00:26:30,000
I called him again,

490
00:26:30,160 --> 00:26:31,160
but the person was not found.

491
00:26:31,880 --> 00:26:33,640
I also sent people there to investigate.

492
00:26:34,040 --> 00:26:34,680
This family

493
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:36,360
never returned to his hometown.

494
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:40,160
This...

495
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:42,400
even though the shop is running well,

496
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,080
but why did it just disappear?

497
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:49,120
Someone who runs a bakcang shop,

498
00:26:50,160 --> 00:26:51,760
it can't have anything to do with this, right?

499
00:26:52,800 --> 00:26:53,640
Didn't you say he had

500
00:26:53,640 --> 00:26:55,000
met Shen Shijie before?

501
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:56,080
Correct.

502
00:26:56,080 --> 00:26:57,160
You can even think about it

503
00:26:57,160 --> 00:26:58,880
told me to investigate the owner of this shop.

504
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:00,200
Why didn't they think of it?

505
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:01,640
and even scared him?

506
00:27:02,440 --> 00:27:03,000
Of course,

507
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,160
I hope they just scare him.

508
00:27:06,880 --> 00:27:07,440
However, now

509
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:08,920
there were still no signs of being killed.

510
00:27:11,320 --> 00:27:13,280
Just because I met Shen Shijie,

511
00:27:14,200 --> 00:27:15,800
So, make him scared and run away, huh?

512
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,920
What time is it now?

513
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,760
Previously, Chen continued to investigate

514
00:27:26,760 --> 00:27:28,080
kasus Shen Shijie.

515
00:27:28,160 --> 00:27:29,440
Therefore, he was killed.

516
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:32,840
The owner of this bakcang shop

517
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:35,440
because he also knew Shen Shijie before,

518
00:27:36,280 --> 00:27:38,600
so, he suddenly disappeared.

519
00:27:40,440 --> 00:27:42,360
In fact, how many secrets there are

520
00:27:42,560 --> 00:27:44,680
did this dead Shen Shijie have?

521
00:27:45,680 --> 00:27:46,920
Until it makes these people

522
00:27:46,920 --> 00:27:48,680
trying so hard

523
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:51,800
remove the traces he left behind.

524
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:57,200
Wait.

525
00:27:57,640 --> 00:27:59,080
What kind of animals are they?

526
00:27:59,080 --> 00:27:59,760
You are the police,

527
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:01,080
can't you take care of it?

528
00:28:07,360 --> 00:28:08,080
Try saying it.

529
00:28:08,920 --> 00:28:09,920
How do we take care of it?

530
00:28:12,600 --> 00:28:13,600
Very simple.

531
00:28:14,360 --> 00:28:15,560
Shen Shijie Dan Dao Jian,

532
00:28:15,560 --> 00:28:16,840
all of them are second uncle's subordinates.

533
00:28:16,920 --> 00:28:17,760
They kill people

534
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:19,000
it must have something to do with second uncle.

535
00:28:19,680 --> 00:28:21,440
Arrest second uncle for interrogation.

536
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:22,120
If you can't,

537
00:28:22,120 --> 00:28:23,440
catch Feng Xiaosheng too.

538
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:24,560
Wouldn't everything be clear?

539
00:28:24,560 --> 00:28:26,200
if capture and interrogate them all?

540
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:29,840
Easy to catch people.

541
00:28:30,280 --> 00:28:31,440
However, do you have any proof?

542
00:28:32,000 --> 00:28:32,600
Nope.

543
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,360
Is evidence more important than people's lives?

544
00:28:36,680 --> 00:28:37,520
Uncle Chen's death

545
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:38,640
It must be because of this group of people.

546
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:39,520
What else should happen,

547
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:40,800
are you going to catch him then?

548
00:28:51,360 --> 00:28:53,600
Every life that died at their hands,

549
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,640
no matter good people or bad people,

550
00:28:57,320 --> 00:28:58,720
all are provocations and insults

551
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:00,000
towards social justice

552
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,240
and police.

553
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:03,480
I wish I could shoot all these bastards dead

554
00:29:03,480 --> 00:29:04,240
with my own hands.

555
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:05,480
However, can I?

556
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:13,440
The gun is here.

557
00:29:15,080 --> 00:29:16,480
As long as you pull the trigger,

558
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,360
that person will die.

559
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:20,720
However, the law will ask you,

560
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:22,240
on what basis?

561
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:27,560
What is the proof?

562
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:30,640
Evidence is used to inform everyone

563
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,160
that they are bad people

564
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,200
and we are good people.

565
00:29:35,680 --> 00:29:37,240
Evidence is used so that everyone knows

566
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:38,680
that Chen is a hero

567
00:29:38,680 --> 00:29:41,200
who died bravely while fighting evil.

568
00:29:41,680 --> 00:29:44,720
Evidence is the reason why you, me and the police fight!

569
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:46,560
Got it, right?

570
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:49,440
Understand.

571
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:51,360
I'm going to look for proof now.

572
00:29:52,240 --> 00:29:53,000
Return!

573
00:30:04,120 --> 00:30:04,720
Wu.

574
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:07,600
What you are facing now is

575
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:09,440
a group of demons who kill people without conscience.

576
00:30:10,120 --> 00:30:11,240
They are not much different from

577
00:30:11,240 --> 00:30:12,720
a group of tigers and evil wolves.

578
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:15,240
At any time unexpected things can happen.

579
00:30:16,160 --> 00:30:18,560
So, you really have to be more careful.

580
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:20,480
If one day you don't want to do it anymore,

581
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:21,600
or...

582
00:30:22,360 --> 00:30:23,360
you feel dangerous,

583
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,360
you can withdraw at any time.

584
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:27,280
Don't force yourself.

585
00:30:29,920 --> 00:30:30,800
Kapten Xiao.

586
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:33,920
I really understand

587
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:35,840
what do I do now.

588
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,320
See you soon.

589
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,600
What do you think of this boy?

590
00:30:52,600 --> 00:30:53,800
I see he's not bad.

591
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:02,400
Okay, thank you.

592
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:05,880
Mrs. Ke is back.

593
00:31:05,880 --> 00:31:07,040
If there's a problem, just ask him.

594
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,640
He's looking for you.

595
00:31:07,640 --> 00:31:08,400
- Good. - Thank You.

596
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,000
Who are you?

597
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:13,280
Bu Ke.

598
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:14,840
I'm a new first year student

599
00:31:14,840 --> 00:31:16,360
majoring in international finance at the Faculty of Economics and Management.

600
00:31:16,480 --> 00:31:17,400
My name is Chen Hemiao.

601
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:19,280
What's looking for me?

602
00:31:19,560 --> 00:31:20,720
I'd like to ask,

603
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,240
do you know where Yu Chengbo is?

604
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:23,400
I've been looking for it for a long time.

605
00:31:23,400 --> 00:31:24,360
The phone was also not answered.

606
00:31:24,800 --> 00:31:26,000
Already asked his dorm mates.

607
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:28,120
He said he didn't know either.

608
00:31:33,320 --> 00:31:35,000
He called in sick and went home.

609
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,040
Oh, I see.

610
00:31:40,520 --> 00:31:41,160
this is

611
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,680
do you know his home address and contact information?

612
00:31:44,760 --> 00:31:45,960
I borrowed some books from him

613
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:47,120
and I haven't returned it yet.

614
00:31:51,360 --> 00:31:52,560
His hometown is outside the city.

615
00:31:53,800 --> 00:31:54,920
Otherwise, it's like this.

616
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:56,360
You save the book first.

617
00:31:56,520 --> 00:31:57,560
After he came back,

618
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,080
just give it back to him, okay?

619
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:02,440
Will he come back?

620
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:07,920
He will be back.

621
00:32:16,340 --> 00:32:19,140
(Jujinxiao Nightclub)

622
00:32:24,200 --> 00:32:25,320
Try saying it.

623
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:26,560
What's the point of me raising you guys?

624
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,880
Money, you can't keep money.

625
00:32:29,040 --> 00:32:30,280
You can't even find people.

626
00:32:30,720 --> 00:32:31,640
Try saying it.

627
00:32:31,640 --> 00:32:32,800
What's the point of me raising you guys?

628
00:32:32,920 --> 00:32:33,840
Eat shit, huh?

629
00:32:34,120 --> 00:32:35,000
Second Uncle.

630
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:36,200
Nanzhou is so big.

631
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:37,360
If someone is hiding,

632
00:32:37,640 --> 00:32:38,840
where should we look for it?

633
00:32:40,080 --> 00:32:40,600
Base.

634
00:32:42,120 --> 00:32:43,720
Do you still dare to answer?

635
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:44,760
Second Uncle, Second Uncle.

636
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:45,840
You don't get angry, don't get angry.

637
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,240
You don't have to argue with this idiot.

638
00:32:47,240 --> 00:32:48,600
Blame me, Second Uncle.

639
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:49,560
Just blame me.

640
00:32:49,560 --> 00:32:50,680
It's true that I can't find it.

641
00:32:50,680 --> 00:32:51,200
You...

642
00:32:52,040 --> 00:32:52,760
Second Uncle!

643
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,040
What is this?

644
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:05,000
Young Master Chi.

645
00:33:09,040 --> 00:33:09,840
Kak Qiang.

646
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:14,320
We haven't seen each other for two years,

647
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,840
why are you getting fat like this?

648
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,520
You've embezzled a lot of my father's money, right?

649
00:33:19,600 --> 00:33:22,040
Look at this speech of yours.

650
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:23,040
Since when did you come back?

651
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,400
I just came back

652
00:33:25,400 --> 00:33:26,840
and came straight here to say hello to you.

653
00:33:27,320 --> 00:33:28,320
Which one of you

654
00:33:28,800 --> 00:33:30,360
that made my father angry?

655
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:33,360
Nothing, nothing.

656
00:33:38,840 --> 00:33:39,600
This is none of your business.

657
00:33:39,720 --> 00:33:40,560
Go home first.

658
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:50,120
Who?

659
00:33:54,600 --> 00:33:55,240
Is it true?

660
00:33:56,560 --> 00:33:58,360
Wait, this information isn't wrong, right?

661
00:34:05,560 --> 00:34:06,400
A... Sister.

662
00:34:06,720 --> 00:34:08,080
Please help me find out more.

663
00:34:10,000 --> 00:34:11,760
Fine.

664
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,200
I understand.

665
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:17,920
What's wrong, Dad?

666
00:34:19,920 --> 00:34:20,880
Dao Jian is dead.

667
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:22,840
Dao Jian is dead?

668
00:34:24,040 --> 00:34:24,600
This...

669
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:26,320
What really happened?

670
00:34:26,840 --> 00:34:29,400
He is dead, what about the money?

671
00:34:32,480 --> 00:34:33,960
Where's my money?

(Captain's Office)

673
00:34:40,920 --> 00:34:41,960
I'm sorry.

674
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,760
I just had a meeting, so I couldn't take the call.

675
00:34:43,920 --> 00:34:44,480
Say it.

676
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:49,840
Fine, fine, fine.

677
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:50,800
Good.

678
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:51,960
Good.

679
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:55,880
Ayah.

680
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,320
In my opinion, such a small amount of money is insignificant.

681
00:34:59,040 --> 00:35:00,140
You still deliberately lie to me

682
00:35:00,140 --> 00:35:01,840
told me to come all the way home from abroad.

683
00:35:01,840 --> 00:35:04,160
Makes me unable to explain it to uncle.

684
00:35:04,160 --> 00:35:05,600
What do you want to explain to him?

685
00:35:05,960 --> 00:35:08,000
Those two have been trying to get rid of us for a long time.

686
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:09,640
When they fight,

687
00:35:09,880 --> 00:35:11,160
they call you back.

688
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:13,400
As soon as the work was finished, he was immediately thrown away.

689
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:14,280
True, or not?

690
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,600
The company's work is still under Sheng's control.

691
00:35:16,840 --> 00:35:18,240
When have they ever believed in us?

692
00:35:19,480 --> 00:35:21,040
Initially,

693
00:35:21,120 --> 00:35:22,200
when he met me, Sheng was still

694
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:23,560
called me "second uncle" very kindly.

695
00:35:23,560 --> 00:35:24,880
Now the bridge of his nose is not visible at all.

696
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:26,000
Does he still have a conscience?

697
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,440
They don't think either,

698
00:35:28,520 --> 00:35:30,000
If I don't go first,

699
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,360
kill for them,

700
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:32,840
they both must have

701
00:35:32,840 --> 00:35:34,240
chopped into this dumpling filling.

702
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:35,160
Ayah.

703
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:37,480
You misunderstood uncle.

704
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:39,880
For the past few years, I've been taking care of it

705
00:35:39,880 --> 00:35:42,120

706
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,040
They are at all

707
00:35:43,040 --> 00:35:43,960
doesn't stop us.

708
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:46,240
Does the money you manage go into your account?

709
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:47,760
Can you use it however you like?

710
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:49,040
How could I use it?

711
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:50,400
Doesn't that mean it's a waste of you to take care of it?

712
00:35:50,600 --> 00:35:51,440
Father, these words of yours.

713
00:35:51,440 --> 00:35:53,000
I'm telling you, yeah, don't ignore my words.

714
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:56,040
Don't underestimate your father, he didn't even pass the second grade of elementary school,

715
00:35:56,040 --> 00:35:57,160
but i'm not stupid

716
00:35:57,720 --> 00:35:59,040
The two of them keep blocking us,

717
00:35:59,040 --> 00:36:00,640
He wanted to get rid of us from the start,

718
00:36:00,640 --> 00:36:01,560
you know, right?

719
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:08,400
What do you see?

720
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:10,520
Is your cell phone more important than your father?

721
00:36:13,280 --> 00:36:13,920
Isn't this your son

722
00:36:13,920 --> 00:36:15,000
have good social relationships?

723
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:16,280
As soon as I found out I was coming back from abroad,

724
00:36:16,280 --> 00:36:17,880
they immediately invited me to eat.

No wonder all relatives and friends

728
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:24,680
highly respect Sheng.

729
00:36:24,840 --> 00:36:26,320
He alone had already reached that far.

730
00:36:26,760 --> 00:36:27,880
Look at yourself.

731
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:28,480
Apart from having fun

732
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:29,520
and flirting with women,

733
00:36:29,520 --> 00:36:30,920
what can you still do?

734
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:36,440

Let's get back to the heart of the matter.

00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:45,960
Today we came here

while he is a foreign citizen,

747
00:37:03,640 --> 00:37:04,680
and settled abroad.

748
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:06,640
Over the years,

749

he doesn't have a steady job.

a playboy who just wastes money.

752
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:14,720
However, the reality is not like that.

00:37:16,960 --> 00:37:19,080
That's a roadmap for their investment abroad.

754
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,480
Please take a look.

755
00:37:21,000 --> 00:37:22,440
(Feng Family Investment Roadmap) We have been monitoring

756
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,560
Feng family's overseas investment.

757
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,280
We found that they diverted

758
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:26,720
large amounts of assets through investment.

759
00:37:27,360 --> 00:37:29,320
In addition, this investment fund

760
00:37:29,840 --> 00:37:32,520
diverted through a very complicated path,

761
00:37:32,760 --> 00:37:34,080
and finally go inside

762
00:37:34,080 --> 00:37:35,320
mysterious account

763
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:36,640
in the Cayman Islands.

764
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:39,480
Moreover, Feng Ruichi in these two years,

765
00:37:39,600 --> 00:37:41,560
often come to this place to dive.

766
00:37:42,240 --> 00:37:43,200
This past week,

767
00:37:43,200 --> 00:37:44,440
our investigators found that

768
00:37:44,680 --> 00:37:45,800
Feng Meng's subordinates

769
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,880
also carry out liquidation

770
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,640
in Nanzhou and surrounding areas,

771
00:37:50,200 --> 00:37:51,280
collect at least

772
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:52,640
40 to 50 million in cash.

773
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:55,120
For the sake of tracking

774
00:37:55,120 --> 00:37:56,320
the ultimate goal of this money,

775
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,120
we do not intercept.

776
00:37:58,920 --> 00:37:59,800
However, later

777
00:37:59,800 --> 00:38:01,880
the money doesn't leave the area at all,

778
00:38:02,440 --> 00:38:04,160
but disappeared mysteriously.

779
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:08,360
Feng Ruichi lived abroad all year.

780
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:10,160
His sudden return this time,

781
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,200
there's definitely a connection

782
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:12,360
with their family's money.

783
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:15,080
However, why them

784
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:16,040
so hasty to divert

785
00:38:16,040 --> 00:38:17,120
so much money?

786
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:20,120
Bureau Chief Liu.

787
00:38:21,480 --> 00:38:22,960
Do you have any clues?

788
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:27,320
Tongbin.

789
00:38:27,960 --> 00:38:29,320
Explain your situation.

790
00:38:31,600 --> 00:38:32,800
Feng Meng's mainstay,

791
00:38:32,800 --> 00:38:34,120
Zhang Zhigao, baru dibunuh.

792
00:38:34,480 --> 00:38:35,600
There should be a connection

793
00:38:35,600 --> 00:38:37,120
with the money that Chairman Li was talking about.

794
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:38,480
I'm looking into it.

795
00:38:38,600 --> 00:38:39,800
At this time there are still no clues.

796
00:38:40,440 --> 00:38:41,520
Chairman Li, don't worry.

797
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:43,560
As long as there is development

798
00:38:43,560 --> 00:38:44,520
from Captain Xiao's investigation,

799
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,440
will definitely contact you soon.

800
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:58,700
(Equality Before the Law)

801
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:00,720
Whether

802
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:02,440
Is there anything you haven't said yet?

803
00:39:04,840 --> 00:39:06,440
The cause of Chen's death has been found.

804
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,160
It was Zhang Zhigao's doing.

805
00:39:10,680 --> 00:39:12,320
Are Zhang Zhigao and Chen

806
00:39:12,840 --> 00:39:14,400
have a conflicting purpose?

807
00:39:15,200 --> 00:39:16,720
Your thinking is really sharp.

808
00:39:17,600 --> 00:39:18,440
There shouldn't be any.

809
00:39:19,360 --> 00:39:20,840
Jadi, kematian Zhang Zhigao

810
00:39:21,240 --> 00:39:23,000
there should be something to do with this.

811
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,280
What's the next step?

812
00:39:28,120 --> 00:39:29,280
Next, we plan

813
00:39:29,280 --> 00:39:30,480
to start attacking again.

814
00:39:30,680 --> 00:39:31,920
Deliberately make them alert.

815
00:39:32,080 --> 00:39:33,440
Create chaos within them.

816
00:39:33,640 --> 00:39:34,480
So that our people

817
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:35,960
can immediately enter their core circle.

818
00:39:39,560 --> 00:39:40,840
Apa Feng Xiaosheng

819
00:39:40,840 --> 00:39:42,280
really Shen Shijie or not,

820
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:45,360
This investigation must be accelerated.

821
00:39:46,000 --> 00:39:47,280
Bureau Chief Liu, you take it easy.

822
00:39:47,640 --> 00:39:48,480
All these are

823
00:39:48,480 --> 00:39:49,480
under our control.

824
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:55,800
You are still the main guest

825
00:39:55,800 --> 00:39:57,000
this year's organizing committee.

826
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:58,600
Apart from that, there are still magazines that will

827
00:39:58,600 --> 00:39:59,680
have an exclusive interview with you.

828
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,160
What did you just say?

829
00:40:04,600 --> 00:40:05,280
I say

830
00:40:05,560 --> 00:40:07,040
You are still the main guest

831
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:08,400
this year's organizing committee.

832
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:10,240
Apart from that, there are still magazines that will

833
00:40:10,240 --> 00:40:11,360
have an exclusive interview with you.

834
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,120
Just say I'm sick.

835
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:16,080
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

836
00:40:16,320 --> 00:40:18,000
what I can postpone I have postponed.

837
00:40:18,440 --> 00:40:20,560
Besides, this forum is very important.

838
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:21,840
You and Mr. Garcia

839
00:40:21,840 --> 00:40:22,960
were good friends for many years.

840
00:40:23,120 --> 00:40:24,760
It wouldn't be good not to go, right?

841
00:40:25,360 --> 00:40:26,680
It depends on your ability.

842
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:29,680
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

843
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:32,640
What do you do when you're in a bad mood?

844
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:36,360
People like us

845
00:40:36,360 --> 00:40:37,480
usually just

846
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:39,120
drinking and bragging with friends.

847
00:40:39,840 --> 00:40:41,760
As you say, let's go have a drink.

848
00:40:41,760 --> 00:40:42,360
Wait.

849
00:40:43,840 --> 00:40:44,560
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

850
00:40:44,920 --> 00:40:45,760
Don't you have

851
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:47,000
lots of meetings scheduled?

852
00:40:48,280 --> 00:40:49,480
What did you just call me?

853
00:40:50,760 --> 00:40:51,880
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

854
00:40:51,960 --> 00:40:52,640
Correct.

855
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:54,520
Let them wait.

856
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,000
Ayo.

857
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:04,480

We are useless.

862

Then, who is useful?

I really don't want to
