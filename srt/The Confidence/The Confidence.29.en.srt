00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 29=

3
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:36,020
Actually

4
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:39,060
I think we are

5
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,420
can change thinking patterns.

6
00:01:41,300 --> 00:01:44,260
There is no need to brutalize Ke Ying.

7
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:47,980
This cursed couple is none other than that

8
00:01:49,260 --> 00:01:50,780
just taking advantage of each other.

9
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:54,060
Not necessarily inseparable.

10
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,500
We just need to stay away

11
00:01:58,340 --> 00:01:59,540
these two people,

12
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:02,900
isn't that okay?

13
00:02:20,140 --> 00:02:21,260
This is what your brother left you?

14
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,380
It seems you're just like your sister,

15
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:28,820
people who value relationships and loyal friends.

16
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:32,220
Gang.

17
00:02:34,060 --> 00:02:34,900
Now you and Wu

18
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:36,500
You could say it's my left and right hand.

19
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:39,740
Because you want to be my hand,

20
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:42,180
then you have to learn to obey.

21
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:44,180
If not,

22
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,340
I'd rather break my hand,

23
00:02:47,180 --> 00:02:49,060
rather than wanting disobedient people.

24
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:50,820
Do you understand?

25
00:02:51,700 --> 00:02:53,140
I... understand.

26
00:02:58,860 --> 00:02:59,420
Drink!

27
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:04,300
Come on, come on.

28
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:06,220
This time the chairman of the board of directors did not mind the previous problem,

29
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:07,700
it's because he's good,

30
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,540
looking at old relationships.

31
00:03:09,860 --> 00:03:11,180
Don't be stubborn anymore.

32
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:13,460
Can't even tell who is closer.

33
00:03:14,020 --> 00:03:15,580
Your brother used to also serve as chairman of the board of directors,

34
00:03:15,580 --> 00:03:16,660
not the father of the chairman of the board of directors.

35
00:03:17,860 --> 00:03:19,140
You hugged the wrong person's leg.

36
00:03:19,140 --> 00:03:20,020
Are you stupid?

37
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:21,740
There is still more.

38
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:23,340
In the future, don't stay at home all the time.

39
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:24,260
Pretending to be mysterious.

40
00:03:24,820 --> 00:03:25,580
Playing on cell phone too much

41
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,100
bad for eyes and neck spine.

42
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:28,980
Go out more often to play with friends,

43
00:03:29,260 --> 00:03:30,020
true, right?

44
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,060
You...

45
00:03:32,460 --> 00:03:33,900
Sis Wu, you look at him!

46
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,260
He drinks too slowly!

47
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:37,140
Had to force someone to drink, huh?

48
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:38,140
Change to another one, you strangle him.

49
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:40,300
Come on, who's afraid?

50
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:40,780
Suit!

51
00:03:40,780 --> 00:03:41,980
No need for a suit, just drink straight away!

52
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:43,580
Am I afraid of you? Come on, come on.

53
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:44,140
Ayo.

54
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:45,300
Ayo.

55
00:03:47,140 --> 00:03:47,620
Hua Zi.

56
00:03:48,580 --> 00:03:50,060
What's wrong with Sis Qiang lately?

57
00:03:50,540 --> 00:03:51,420
He's invisible,

58
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:52,820
the phone was also not picked up.

59
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:54,260
I also do not know.

60
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:55,860
We also haven't seen him for a long time.

61
00:03:56,020 --> 00:03:56,820
Really?

62
00:03:58,580 --> 00:03:59,420
Let's drink.

63
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:01,260
Come on, come on.

64
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:02,420
You... you... raise your drink.

65
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:45,700
Mr. Feng.

66
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:47,620
Sorry, I'm late.

67
00:04:49,420 --> 00:04:50,380
Where's the item?

68
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:05,340
Mr. Feng.

69
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,580
What do you think the situation is like now?

70
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,260
Police are investigating

71
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:13,660
the person in charge of the car factory who ran away with the money.

72
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,100
The company has also released

73
00:05:15,100 --> 00:05:16,780
announcement of a big reward for those who provide clues.

74
00:05:22,700 --> 00:05:24,620
Your hiding place is now being searched by second uncle?

75
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:30,900
If I were you,

76
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,940
I will hide from second uncle first.

77
00:05:41,020 --> 00:05:41,580
There's more,

78
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:45,340
then don't be late again.

79
00:06:23,940 --> 00:06:24,620
good morning

80
00:06:34,540 --> 00:06:35,460
What do you guys see?

81
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:38,820
Sis.

82
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:39,740
Sis.

83
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,500
Here.

84
00:06:42,500 --> 00:06:43,660
You haven't looked at the internet, have you?

85
00:06:44,140 --> 00:06:45,140
What do you see?

86
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:46,340
You don't even know about this?

87
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:48,940
Quickly open the internet and see the trending topic about Nanzhou,

88
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:50,260
then you will know what is going on.

89
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:11,740
(Feng Xiaosheng and Lian Lian Scandal News)

90
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,740
I don't care what method you use.

91
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,180
Quick

92
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:34,540
get rid of all the obscure news on the internet.

93
00:07:34,820 --> 00:07:35,820
Just that.

94
00:07:55,460 --> 00:07:56,580
Actually, what do you think?

95
00:07:58,460 --> 00:07:59,820
I feel this problem...

96
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,020
very strange.

97
00:08:06,980 --> 00:08:08,300
Regarding gossip between men and women,

98
00:08:08,580 --> 00:08:09,660
you, me, Lian Lian,

99
00:08:09,660 --> 00:08:11,060
we are not all public figures.

100
00:08:12,380 --> 00:08:13,500
If no one exposes this news,

101
00:08:13,580 --> 00:08:14,780
no one will be watching us.

102
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:18,100
Apart from that, the information he got was also very clear.

103
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:20,940
Lian Lian and I's old secrets were all revealed.

104
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:39,260
Finally I understand.

105
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:40,900
What you mean by what you say is

106
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,570
Big Boss Feng secretly framed us,

107
00:08:42,570 --> 00:08:43,930
wants to separate us, really?

108
00:08:44,660 --> 00:08:45,900
There's no one else I can think of anymore.

109
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:56,580
(Incoming Call; Lian Lian)

110
00:08:58,020 --> 00:08:58,820
Accept it.

111
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:04,900
Halo.

112
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:09,540
Good.

113
00:09:13,820 --> 00:09:14,660
He said he wanted to see me.

114
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:16,900
Don't even think about it,

115
00:09:17,340 --> 00:09:19,060
definitely want to discuss this gossip issue with you.

116
00:09:20,060 --> 00:09:21,260
Don't go, I'll go.

117
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:25,900
The me who appears will be better,

118
00:09:25,900 --> 00:09:26,900
talk about it straight away,

119
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,980
Don't let him misunderstand me.

120
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:29,620
Good.

121
00:09:30,020 --> 00:09:31,020
If so, I'll leave it to you.

122
00:09:32,260 --> 00:09:33,020
Let's make it like this,

123
00:09:33,460 --> 00:09:34,740
I'll tell Gang to go with you.

124
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:36,140
Okay.

125
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,580
Did Lian Lian really like Yang Yuze?

126
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:52,260
Of.

127
00:10:27,140 --> 00:10:28,300
You wait for me outside.

128
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,460
Why even you?

129
00:11:00,020 --> 00:11:01,220
He's in a meeting, doesn't have time.

130
00:11:01,420 --> 00:11:02,460
So, asked me to come here.

131
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:07,020
Hello Miss, what drink would you like to order?

132
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:16,260
Very disappointed, huh?

133
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:21,500
What do you mean by this?

134
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:23,860
News on the internet

135
00:11:23,860 --> 00:11:24,980
it's all just rumors,

136
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:25,980
that's slander.

137
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,500
There isn't anything

138
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,540
between me and Feng Xiaosheng.

139
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:30,540
Those photos

140
00:11:30,780 --> 00:11:32,420
taken when he took me to see

141
00:11:32,420 --> 00:11:34,100
Aoxin's car technology supervisor, David.

142
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:36,140
I asked him to meet today,

143
00:11:36,660 --> 00:11:38,220
just want to discuss with him

144
00:11:38,220 --> 00:11:39,980
about how to deal with rumors on the internet.

145
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,980
Don't let anyone think too much,

146
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:45,260
count

147
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:46,980
there are people who want to snatch a rich future husband with her.

148
00:11:51,460 --> 00:11:53,180
I understand you much more than you can imagine.

149
00:11:54,420 --> 00:11:55,540
With your character,

150
00:11:57,340 --> 00:11:59,620
if you see vague rumors like this on the internet,

151
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:01,020
you will ignore it,

152
00:12:01,020 --> 00:12:03,220
or you will immediately look for me to explain it.

153
00:12:05,020 --> 00:12:07,540
You definitely wouldn't contact a guy you had rumors about.

154
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:09,660
Meanwhile today you stepped over me,

155
00:12:11,180 --> 00:12:12,540
and immediately invited Feng Xiaosheng to meet.

156
00:12:14,660 --> 00:12:15,500
Lian Lian.

157
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,140
Why?

158
00:12:21,740 --> 00:12:24,020
You want to get close to Feng Xiaosheng, for what exactly?

159
00:12:30,220 --> 00:12:30,980
Reasonable.

160
00:12:31,740 --> 00:12:33,580
Still the Ke Ying I know.

161
00:12:35,900 --> 00:12:37,740
Lian Lian, I don't care what you do it for.

162
00:12:37,740 --> 00:12:38,940
Listen to my advice.

163
00:12:40,100 --> 00:12:41,740
Don't interfere in the matters of the Feng Group, okay?

164
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:44,060
Jauhilah Feng Xiaosheng.

165
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,380
The further away the better.

166
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:47,620
Impossible.

167
00:12:49,260 --> 00:12:51,220
Qiao Yu is still not willing to show up until now,

168
00:12:51,940 --> 00:12:53,580
didn't even answer phone calls at all.

169
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,860
Teacher Xing was even more unwilling to see me.

170
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:02,540
They spend so much time and effort,

171
00:13:03,380 --> 00:13:05,500
but now he's hiding like a mouse.

172
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:07,900
According to you

173
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:11,540
Is their aim just to create fake news to attract attention?

174
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:14,700
Likewise with you,

175
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:16,260
hinder at all costs,

176
00:13:16,260 --> 00:13:17,540
didn't let me investigate the Feng Group.

177
00:13:19,380 --> 00:13:21,540
Don't hesitate to slander in public.

178
00:13:22,060 --> 00:13:23,060
Transform yourself into a person

179
00:13:23,060 --> 00:13:24,540
very cunning and low woman.

180
00:13:24,540 --> 00:13:25,100
Lian Lian.

181
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,020
Ke Ying!

182
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:29,500
Just like you said.

183
00:13:30,100 --> 00:13:31,820
You understand me much more than I imagined.

184
00:13:32,740 --> 00:13:33,580
This sentence too

185
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:34,860
applies to you.

186
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:38,860
What kind of person are you?

187
00:13:38,860 --> 00:13:40,460
I know very clearly.

188
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:43,500
All your changes now,

189
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,100
all of that happened after getting to know Feng Xiaosheng.

190
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:49,820
Actually because of what?

191
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,060
It doesn't matter if you don't want to say it.

192
00:13:59,620 --> 00:14:00,580
I will find the answer myself.

193
00:14:04,540 --> 00:14:05,740
If I tell you the answer,

194
00:14:06,140 --> 00:14:07,700
can you not interfere in the affairs of the Feng Group?

195
00:14:08,100 --> 00:14:08,900
Can't.

196
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:15,500
Some time ago,

197
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,780
I saw Yang Yuze

198
00:14:18,740 --> 00:14:19,900
at the door of the press conference.

199
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:25,540
The conditions are very bad.

200
00:14:26,140 --> 00:14:27,220
Looks dazed.

201
00:14:29,300 --> 00:14:30,620
Like changing into someone else.

202
00:14:36,980 --> 00:14:38,380
As a friend of the two of you,

203
00:14:38,620 --> 00:14:39,740
I suggest you,

204
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:43,180
not because of what you think is right,

205
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:46,060
ultimately destroying his life.

206
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:08,860
Have met.

207
00:15:09,460 --> 00:15:10,580
What else can I do?

208
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,020
don't fight in public

209
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,020
it can be said to be good.

210
00:15:13,380 --> 00:15:14,500
I'm surprised too,

211
00:15:14,500 --> 00:15:16,700
how come you have been friends with this person for so many years.

212
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,540
He should still be suspicious about the car factory problem.

213
00:15:24,100 --> 00:15:25,540
Can you promise me one thing?

214
00:15:29,340 --> 00:15:30,780
Ask him to stay away from you.

215
00:15:31,260 --> 00:15:32,540
Don't get too close to him.

216
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:33,460
No matter what,

217
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,460
he is still my friend.

218
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:42,020
Oh, yeah, my head hurts a little.

219
00:15:42,340 --> 00:15:43,500
I'm not going to the company again today.

220
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:44,740
I'm going home first to rest.

221
00:15:50,780 --> 00:15:52,340
Don't sit in the back, just sit in the front.

222
00:15:54,420 --> 00:15:55,940
I've already told your boss.

223
00:15:55,940 --> 00:15:57,700
No need to go to the company, go straight home.

224
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:20,900
(Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors)

225
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,140
Enter.

226
00:16:31,460 --> 00:16:32,340
Sis, are you looking for me?

227
00:16:59,300 --> 00:17:00,660
Sis, don't look at me like that.

228
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:02,420
Looks strange and scary.

229
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:07,220
No need, no need.

230
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,220
Sit down.

231
00:17:21,330 --> 00:17:23,090
I want to give you a job.

232
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,740
Fine, you say.

233
00:17:27,330 --> 00:17:28,180
No matter what problem,

234
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,540
ascend to the mountain of knives or descend into the sea of ​​fire,

235
00:17:29,620 --> 00:17:30,860
I will definitely handle it well for you.

236
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:33,460
Help me conquer a woman.

237
00:17:34,660 --> 00:17:35,460
Women?

238
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,300
Who?

239
00:17:40,620 --> 00:17:42,060
Company finance supervisor,

240
00:17:42,580 --> 00:17:43,380
Yuan Fenfang.

241
00:17:46,220 --> 00:17:46,980
Sis.

242
00:17:49,140 --> 00:17:50,060
I'm afraid this...

243
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:51,740
Can't.

244
00:17:52,700 --> 00:17:53,660
You have to do it.

245
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,580
Why?

246
00:18:01,100 --> 00:18:02,460
Because it's in his hands

247
00:18:02,460 --> 00:18:03,940
there is another set of confidential transaction journals.

248
00:18:04,620 --> 00:18:06,540
For half a year I left the company,

249
00:18:06,740 --> 00:18:08,380
CEO perusahaan, Wang Changjun,

250
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:09,740
together with the person in charge of the Aoxin car factory,

251
00:18:09,740 --> 00:18:11,460
Xu Feng and others control the company.

252
00:18:11,620 --> 00:18:13,900
Forging contracts, buying and selling transactions, transferring large amounts of funds,

253
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,740
all the evidence is inside.

254
00:18:19,700 --> 00:18:20,620
For me

255
00:18:20,940 --> 00:18:22,140
and also the Feng Group,

256
00:18:22,700 --> 00:18:23,860
that's very important.

257
00:18:31,220 --> 00:18:32,220
I will try it.

258
00:18:42,300 --> 00:18:43,940
I heard An say, you can defend yourself.

259
00:18:44,180 --> 00:18:44,940
Is it true?

260
00:18:49,620 --> 00:18:50,660
Where did you learn it?

261
00:18:51,540 --> 00:18:52,420
House.

262
00:18:52,700 --> 00:18:53,540
House?

263
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,460
In our village

264
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,980
every family practices martial arts.

265
00:18:58,940 --> 00:19:00,300
There really is a village like that, huh?

266
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,980
I once read it in a book,

267
00:19:02,380 --> 00:19:03,660
I think it's just made up.

268
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,540
It's not made up, Miss Ke.

269
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:06,460
All of that is true.

270
00:19:07,700 --> 00:19:08,780
Our elders said,

271
00:19:08,980 --> 00:19:11,540
Our ancestors were all martial artists.

272
00:19:12,140 --> 00:19:14,380
Used to join the boxer rebellion to the north

273
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:15,220
to be a guard.

274
00:19:15,780 --> 00:19:17,700
Then, settle down and form a village.

275
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:19,060
We are his children and grandchildren,

276
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,300
all of them also practice martial arts.

277
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:27,300
Then, your sister...

278
00:19:27,300 --> 00:19:28,300
can he also defend himself?

279
00:19:28,700 --> 00:19:29,460
Can.

280
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:31,220
My brother's martial arts are better than mine.

281
00:19:33,300 --> 00:19:34,380
What does your sister look like?

282
00:19:35,140 --> 00:19:36,020
Is it the same as you?

283
00:19:36,020 --> 00:19:37,620
who is tall and strong?

284
00:19:39,300 --> 00:19:40,260
No.

285
00:19:40,660 --> 00:19:42,380
My brother is different from me.

286
00:19:43,060 --> 00:19:43,860
My older brother...

287
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:45,940
He is cool.

288
00:19:46,300 --> 00:19:46,980
Handsome.

289
00:19:47,740 --> 00:19:48,740
His brain is also smart.

290
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:51,420
Not like me,

291
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,940
idiot and fool.

292
00:19:54,940 --> 00:19:56,220
You're not an idiot and you're not stupid.

293
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,860
You're honest.

294
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,420
Two

295
00:20:04,420 --> 00:20:05,740
smarter than Gang?

296
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,460
Correct.

297
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,060
Hai followed the chairman of the board of directors for many years,

298
00:20:10,060 --> 00:20:11,420
be a driver and bodyguard.

299
00:20:11,540 --> 00:20:13,060
Most trusted by the chairman of the board of directors

300
00:20:13,060 --> 00:20:14,420
and taken everywhere.

301
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:53,500
Supervisor Yuan.

302
00:20:53,900 --> 00:20:54,860
What's wrong with your feet?

303
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,780
Who are you? Base.

304
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,700
Good grief.

305
00:21:07,460 --> 00:21:08,500
Is your car tire flat?

306
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,060
Mr. Meng?

307
00:21:10,380 --> 00:21:11,940
I don't know you.

308
00:21:12,980 --> 00:21:14,620
What is it Mr Meng?

309
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:15,740
Just call me Wu.

310
00:21:18,860 --> 00:21:20,180
Let me help you change the spare tire.

311
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,540
No need, no need.

312
00:21:22,060 --> 00:21:23,660
I can call a repairman.

313
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:25,020
No problem.

314
00:21:25,740 --> 00:21:26,780
It's just a matter of a few minutes,

315
00:21:26,780 --> 00:21:27,900
It's not a difficult job either.

316
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:42,060
I...

317
00:21:42,780 --> 00:21:43,660
That's... okay.

318
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:50,140
Don't come here.

319
00:21:50,300 --> 00:21:51,300
Be careful about you later.

320
00:21:51,900 --> 00:21:52,700
You see,

321
00:21:53,020 --> 00:21:54,140
I really don't feel good.

322
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:55,860
Bothering you like this.

323
00:21:57,020 --> 00:21:57,940
Move away a little.

324
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:12,740
Finished.

325
00:22:12,940 --> 00:22:14,060
This can last for several days.

326
00:22:14,540 --> 00:22:15,780
However, it is better to go to a service center

327
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,020
to repair the previous tire.

328
00:22:17,460 --> 00:22:18,380
If you really can't,

329
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,140
just replace it.

330
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:20,260
Safer.

331
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:24,300
For you.

332
00:22:24,300 --> 00:22:25,260
To wipe hands.

333
00:22:25,260 --> 00:22:26,420
Thank you.

334
00:22:26,900 --> 00:22:27,900
Just remember this great kindness in your heart.

335
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:30,540
Just kidding, don't take it personally.

336
00:22:33,260 --> 00:22:34,380
A girl

337
00:22:35,780 --> 00:22:37,460
don't work until this late every day.

338
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,700
It is not safe to go home alone on the street.

339
00:22:44,300 --> 00:22:45,020
Let's go.

340
00:22:46,860 --> 00:22:47,660
Here.

341
00:22:48,980 --> 00:22:50,260
Your feet are fine, right?

342
00:22:50,260 --> 00:22:51,260
Do I need to take you?

343
00:22:51,540 --> 00:22:52,460
It's okay, it's okay.

344
00:22:52,540 --> 00:22:53,500
Are you sure?

345
00:22:53,780 --> 00:22:54,860
It doesn't matter.

346
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:58,900
My clothes.

347
00:22:59,300 --> 00:23:00,220
Sorry.

348
00:23:00,500 --> 00:23:01,500
Thank you, thank you.

349
00:23:03,060 --> 00:23:03,660
Slowly.

350
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:11,700
Drive slowly.

351
00:23:15,420 --> 00:23:16,180
See you soon.

352
00:23:53,900 --> 00:23:55,420
It's so late and still haven't slept?

353
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:58,020
Staying up late will ruin your beauty.

354
00:23:59,980 --> 00:24:01,060
Come here, sit here.

355
00:24:10,500 --> 00:24:11,380
Why?

356
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,940
I asked you.

357
00:24:17,020 --> 00:24:18,900
Regarding rumors on the internet, are they true?

358
00:24:21,580 --> 00:24:22,660
You just startled me.

359
00:24:22,660 --> 00:24:24,340
I thought what a big deal.

360
00:24:26,060 --> 00:24:27,220
About news on the internet,

361
00:24:27,220 --> 00:24:29,500
Ke Ying, who was the person involved, couldn't believe it.

362
00:24:30,100 --> 00:24:31,100
This mother...

363
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:32,580
Do you even believe it yourself?

364
00:24:33,700 --> 00:24:35,140
What is my relationship with Ke Ying?

365
00:24:35,580 --> 00:24:36,380
Others don't know,

366
00:24:36,380 --> 00:24:37,580
don't you know either?

367
00:24:37,820 --> 00:24:39,740
Me and him fighting over a man?

368
00:24:40,260 --> 00:24:41,460
If you want to fight, it should be me and that guy

369
00:24:41,460 --> 00:24:42,860
who are both fighting over him, you know?

370
00:24:42,940 --> 00:24:44,020
OK, I just asked you one sentence.

371
00:24:44,020 --> 00:24:45,660
Look at that mouth of yours, babbling non-stop.

372
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,420
There are even photos on the internet.

373
00:24:48,700 --> 00:24:50,180
Didn't I tell you before?

374
00:24:50,540 --> 00:24:51,620
It is true.

375
00:24:51,620 --> 00:24:53,380
For the sake of investigating the Feng Group's Aoxin car project,

376
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:54,540
akudan Feng Xiaosheng

377
00:24:54,540 --> 00:24:56,020
have interacted several times.

378
00:24:56,380 --> 00:24:57,580
Those photos you mentioned,

379
00:24:57,940 --> 00:24:59,220
taken when he took me

380
00:24:59,300 --> 00:25:02,980
met with Aoxin's car technology supervisor at the hotel.

381
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,020
The tech supervisor was staying at the hotel.

382
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,260
Is what you said true?

383
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,380
If it's not true, is it fake?

384
00:25:09,660 --> 00:25:10,940
You are also very funny.

385
00:25:11,180 --> 00:25:12,260
Where is the birth mother?

386
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,700
who would doubt his own daughter?

387
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,700
I don't not believe you.

388
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,660
If you believe me,

389
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,820
would it be possible to interrogate me like a prisoner?

390
00:25:20,820 --> 00:25:22,620
Wasn't I worried that you were acting impulsively?

391
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,380
and doing things that shouldn't be done.

392
00:25:24,700 --> 00:25:25,460
Mother.

393
00:25:25,900 --> 00:25:27,940
Your daughter is no longer young.

394
00:25:27,940 --> 00:25:29,580
My emotions are also less explosive.

395
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:33,180
Can I take a shower?

396
00:25:33,260 --> 00:25:33,900
Can't.

397
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,780
Regarding the Feng Group problem,

398
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:38,020
Don't interfere anymore.

399
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:40,900
I've already

400
00:25:40,900 --> 00:25:42,140
told you many times.

401
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:43,900
There is an investigation team currently investigating.

402
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:45,180
Even though there is a mastermind behind it,

403
00:25:45,180 --> 00:25:46,740
sooner or later it will be revealed.

404
00:25:47,300 --> 00:25:48,940
If there really is a mastermind behind it,

405
00:25:49,220 --> 00:25:51,260
I want to be the one who uncovers the mastermind behind it.

406
00:25:51,660 --> 00:25:52,820
You can't.

407
00:25:52,820 --> 00:25:54,340
Why can't I?

408
00:25:56,860 --> 00:25:57,780
Lian Lian.

409
00:25:58,340 --> 00:26:00,460
The Feng Group's problems are too complicated.

410
00:26:00,460 --> 00:26:02,620
It can't be explained in just a few words.

411
00:26:03,860 --> 00:26:04,500
You take a look.

412
00:26:04,940 --> 00:26:07,780
You really value the truth, are kind and hate evil.

413
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:09,300
This is very good quality.

414
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:11,220
Mom is also very proud of you.

415
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,340
However, there are many things

416
00:26:13,700 --> 00:26:14,740
which cannot be resolved

417
00:26:14,740 --> 00:26:16,020
only with your own abilities.

418
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:19,020
You investigate the Feng Group,

419
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:20,100
It does not matter.

420
00:26:20,620 --> 00:26:21,900
However, not now.

421
00:26:22,460 --> 00:26:23,340
Slowly.

422
00:26:23,540 --> 00:26:24,900
Have to wait for an opportunity.

423
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,620
Mother.

424
00:26:28,140 --> 00:26:29,180
Are you

425
00:26:29,180 --> 00:26:30,300
know anything?

426
00:26:32,300 --> 00:26:33,300
Of course I know.

427
00:26:33,420 --> 00:26:34,460
Then, you tell me.

428
00:26:35,180 --> 00:26:36,220
Can I tell you?

429
00:26:36,220 --> 00:26:37,420
I am bound by a confidentiality agreement.

430
00:26:37,980 --> 00:26:39,940
Can't tell about job problems to anyone.

431
00:26:42,580 --> 00:26:43,700
I chatted with you in vain.

432
00:26:43,700 --> 00:26:44,500
Okay.

433
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,500
In that case,

434
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:47,540
You just continue to maintain your confidentiality agreement.

435
00:26:47,540 --> 00:26:49,140
However, I also have my own career ambitions.

436
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,460
Investigate the truth,

437
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:51,260
reveal the mastermind behind it

438
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,660
is my career ambition.

439
00:26:52,740 --> 00:26:53,380
Already.

440
00:26:53,380 --> 00:26:54,380
You don't say anything else.

441
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,740
I have to go take a shower now.

442
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:14,820
These several days,

443
00:27:14,820 --> 00:27:16,260
why didn't you see Miss Ke coming to report?

444
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,060
He said at school

445
00:27:18,060 --> 00:27:19,460
Looks like there's a test.

446
00:27:19,460 --> 00:27:20,540
So, I had to go back.

447
00:27:20,860 --> 00:27:22,100
Why go back to school again?

448
00:27:22,100 --> 00:27:23,100
If I were him,

449
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:24,620
I will immediately resign from my job at school.

450
00:27:24,700 --> 00:27:26,060
Wholeheartedly supervise the chairman of the board of directors,

451
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:27,020
don't take it.

452
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:29,180
Secretary An.

453
00:27:35,700 --> 00:27:36,980
You still don't know, right?

454
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:39,180
I heard, that Journalist Lian

455
00:27:39,180 --> 00:27:41,020
is a good woman who is beautiful and rich,

456
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:42,740
is the rich daughter of a city-level leader.

457
00:27:43,140 --> 00:27:45,100
He is very compatible with our chairman of the board of directors.

458
00:27:46,300 --> 00:27:48,220
A man like our chairman of the board of directors,

459
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:49,740
you can date as you like.

460
00:27:50,100 --> 00:27:50,900
Eventually,

461
00:27:50,900 --> 00:27:51,940
who will be married

462
00:27:51,940 --> 00:27:54,420
isn't it still a woman from a dignified family like Journalist Lian?

463
00:27:54,860 --> 00:27:55,900
Isn't Miss Ke

464
00:27:55,900 --> 00:27:56,940
already his fiancé?

465
00:27:57,980 --> 00:27:58,740
Fiancé?

466
00:27:58,740 --> 00:27:59,820
He thinks so himself, right?

467
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,060
When have you ever heard

468
00:28:01,060 --> 00:28:02,180
the Feng family acknowledged him?

469
00:28:03,500 --> 00:28:04,700
There are rumors that Big Boss Feng

470
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:06,300
didn't even let him enter the house.

471
00:28:06,300 --> 00:28:07,620
He didn't consider it at all.

472
00:28:09,500 --> 00:28:10,660
You two, that's enough, okay?

473
00:28:11,620 --> 00:28:13,020
Be careful, your mouth will cause problems.

474
00:28:15,820 --> 00:28:16,980
Hello, director's office.

475
00:28:18,340 --> 00:28:19,460
Secretary An, looking for you.

476
00:28:23,620 --> 00:28:24,380
Halo.

477
00:28:26,940 --> 00:28:27,580
Section Chief Ding.

478
00:28:29,660 --> 00:28:30,740
Fine, I know.

479
00:28:35,060 --> 00:28:36,620
Be careful, your mouth will cause problems.

480
00:28:36,740 --> 00:28:37,820
Work well.

481
00:28:42,180 --> 00:28:43,340
I still haven't finished talking to you.

482
00:28:43,340 --> 00:28:44,060
According to you,

483
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:45,660
that... I heard...

484
00:28:45,660 --> 00:28:46,780
I also heard that...

485
00:28:54,580 --> 00:28:55,220
Enter.

486
00:28:58,900 --> 00:28:59,660
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

487
00:29:00,180 --> 00:29:01,940
Written interview reporter previously arranged

488
00:29:01,940 --> 00:29:02,940
has arrived.

489
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:04,220
Section Chief Ding of the Public Relations Department,

490
00:29:04,220 --> 00:29:05,180
call to ask,

491
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:07,260
do you want to call him here now?

492
00:29:09,940 --> 00:29:11,100
Next, what schedule do we have?

493
00:29:12,140 --> 00:29:13,980
There are two meetings you need to attend.

494
00:29:15,940 --> 00:29:17,060
If so, let them wait a while.

495
00:29:17,060 --> 00:29:18,140
Invite the reporter here first.

496
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,140
That...

497
00:29:21,940 --> 00:29:22,820
Chairman of the Board of Directors...

498
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,900
Hurry up.

499
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:36,500
today,

500
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:38,660
along the way came to your company,

501
00:29:38,660 --> 00:29:40,500
everyone felt very strange when they saw me.

502
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,300
Hello, Mr. Feng.

503
00:29:48,500 --> 00:29:49,540
There's no need to be so shy,

504
00:29:49,780 --> 00:29:51,020
This isn't the first time we've met either.

505
00:29:52,300 --> 00:29:53,300
That is true.

506
00:29:54,260 --> 00:29:56,020
However, I apologize first.

507
00:29:56,340 --> 00:29:58,020
Colleagues who have previously had an appointment with you,

508
00:29:58,140 --> 00:29:59,300
suddenly got sick.

509
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:00,660
I came to replace him.

510
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:02,740
How?

511
00:30:02,940 --> 00:30:03,780
Today...

512
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:05,620
can you accept an interview from me?

513
00:30:06,980 --> 00:30:07,940
Or,

514
00:30:08,660 --> 00:30:09,740
you feel uncomfortable

515
00:30:10,060 --> 00:30:11,340
and would like to arrange an interview at another time,

516
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:13,460
wait until my colleague recovers before interviewing?

517
00:30:17,500 --> 00:30:18,380
An.

518
00:30:18,700 --> 00:30:19,900
Pour a cup of coffee for Miss Lian.

519
00:30:22,820 --> 00:30:23,620
Good.

520
00:30:36,820 --> 00:30:37,740
Let's start.

521
00:30:41,460 --> 00:30:42,460
First question.

522
00:30:42,780 --> 00:30:44,340
Aoxin car factory fire this time

523
00:30:44,860 --> 00:30:47,220
what kind of impact will it have on the Feng Group?

524
00:30:48,900 --> 00:30:49,780
A crisis,

525
00:30:50,300 --> 00:30:51,300
but also an opportunity.

526
00:30:52,940 --> 00:30:54,260
What does this saying mean?

527
00:31:07,900 --> 00:31:08,900
Time is running out.

528
00:31:09,380 --> 00:31:11,100
Everyone double check the names,

529
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:11,780
registration number,

530
00:31:11,860 --> 00:31:13,020
Get ready to collect exam papers.

531
00:31:25,180 --> 00:31:25,980
Yu Chengbo.

532
00:31:25,980 --> 00:31:26,980
Wait for me outside for a moment.

533
00:31:46,460 --> 00:31:47,900
The girl who has a good relationship with you,

534
00:31:47,900 --> 00:31:48,900
whose name is Miao Miao.

535
00:31:49,940 --> 00:31:51,300
Now he works part time at the club,

536
00:31:51,820 --> 00:31:52,860
do you know?

537
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,100
Know.

538
00:32:00,780 --> 00:32:01,740
Why go there?

539
00:32:02,660 --> 00:32:03,460
Childish.

540
00:32:03,740 --> 00:32:04,660
Stupid.

541
00:32:07,020 --> 00:32:07,700
Do you think?

542
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:08,740
other people are stupid, huh?

543
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:10,900
Do you know how dangerous that place is?

544
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:12,740
If something happens to you,

545
00:32:12,740 --> 00:32:14,180
no one can save you.

546
00:32:15,780 --> 00:32:17,020
Tell Miao Miao now,

547
00:32:17,020 --> 00:32:18,380
leave that place and be forbidden to go there again.

548
00:32:18,540 --> 00:32:19,620
If still going there,

549
00:32:19,980 --> 00:32:21,340
I will report it to the school.

550
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,900
Didn't I tell you?

551
00:32:26,260 --> 00:32:27,420
You don't need to interfere

552
00:32:27,420 --> 00:32:28,380
regarding my personal problems.

553
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:29,660
Bu Ke.

554
00:32:30,420 --> 00:32:32,100
Was Feng Xiaosheng really Shen Shijie?

555
00:32:35,740 --> 00:32:36,940
What nonsense are you talking about?

556
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:38,300
Unclear.

557
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:40,780
Miao Miao's surname is Chen.

558
00:32:41,660 --> 00:32:43,180
His father's name is Chen Jinyan.

559
00:32:44,180 --> 00:32:45,260
Does Mrs. Ke know him?

560
00:32:50,060 --> 00:32:51,580
Mrs. Ke must know him, right?

561
00:32:52,940 --> 00:32:54,700
Mrs. Ke once went to look for Officer Chen,

562
00:32:54,940 --> 00:32:57,060
told him that Feng Xiaosheng was Shen Shijie.

563
00:32:59,620 --> 00:33:00,940
I don't know what you're talking about.

564
00:33:01,060 --> 00:33:02,300
You know what I'm talking about.

565
00:33:04,820 --> 00:33:05,740
Yu Chengbo.

566
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,140
Do you still remember?

567
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,220
What did you experience in the warehouse?

568
00:33:13,660 --> 00:33:14,860
If you still remember,

569
00:33:15,940 --> 00:33:17,220
then go stop Miao Miao.

570
00:33:18,860 --> 00:33:19,860
You tell him,

571
00:33:19,860 --> 00:33:21,100
about his father's problem,

572
00:33:21,100 --> 00:33:22,500
I will give him an explanation.

573
00:33:25,060 --> 00:33:25,620
However...

574
00:33:25,620 --> 00:33:26,700
Nothing however.

575
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:30,420
As your teacher,

576
00:33:30,700 --> 00:33:33,140
me asking you to do those things was indeed a big mistake.

577
00:33:34,220 --> 00:33:35,700
I caused you such a big wound.

578
00:33:35,700 --> 00:33:37,340
I really really hate myself.

579
00:33:38,740 --> 00:33:39,900
I don't want those things

580
00:33:40,220 --> 00:33:41,380
come back to hurt you again.

581
00:33:41,380 --> 00:33:42,580
I didn't expect those things either

582
00:33:42,660 --> 00:33:44,620
bringing more danger to Officer Chen's family.

583
00:33:46,340 --> 00:33:47,900
If you still think of me as your teacher,

584
00:33:48,340 --> 00:33:49,380
listen to me.

585
00:33:49,540 --> 00:33:50,380
If not,

586
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,660
You're just adding to my problems.

587
00:33:58,660 --> 00:33:59,340
Good.

588
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,220
Go away.

589
00:34:19,610 --> 00:34:20,820
Final question.

590
00:34:23,130 --> 00:34:24,580
As a young promising man,

591
00:34:24,940 --> 00:34:26,210
how you look

592
00:34:26,340 --> 00:34:27,650
personal relationship problems?

593
00:34:29,260 --> 00:34:31,900
What characteristics of women most attract your attention?

594
00:34:33,100 --> 00:34:35,940
How do you and your current boyfriend know each other?

595
00:34:38,340 --> 00:34:39,170
Journalist Lian.

596
00:34:39,170 --> 00:34:39,780
This is how it should be

597
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:41,100
not a question from the list of questions, right?

598
00:34:42,420 --> 00:34:43,380
It's not.

599
00:34:44,100 --> 00:34:45,340
I suddenly added it.

600
00:34:46,690 --> 00:34:47,580
No problem.

601
00:34:48,300 --> 00:34:49,820
If you don't want to answer,

602
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,170
you can refuse to answer.

603
00:34:52,300 --> 00:34:53,300
I can answer.

604
00:34:56,100 --> 00:34:57,220
In September,

605
00:34:57,420 --> 00:34:58,420
our company

606
00:34:58,420 --> 00:35:00,780
held a donation ceremony at Nanzhou University.

607
00:35:01,220 --> 00:35:02,420
I attended as a guest.

608
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:03,940
We met by chance.

609
00:35:04,620 --> 00:35:05,420
I

610
00:35:05,620 --> 00:35:06,820
fell in love at first sight.

611
00:35:07,300 --> 00:35:08,100
So,

612
00:35:08,220 --> 00:35:09,380
I started chasing him.

613
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:12,820
However, that time

614
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:14,340
he has a girlfriend.

615
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,780
More precisely, fiancé.

616
00:35:19,340 --> 00:35:20,900
So, are you still chasing him?

617
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,420
Not just chasing,

618
00:35:23,060 --> 00:35:24,220
approached him shamelessly.

619
00:35:24,740 --> 00:35:26,700
Hardly, just got it.

620
00:35:30,740 --> 00:35:31,860
Our interview...

621
00:35:32,580 --> 00:35:33,620
could it be over already?

622
00:35:34,940 --> 00:35:36,060
Ended perfectly.

623
00:35:36,660 --> 00:35:37,420
Thank You.

624
00:35:50,940 --> 00:35:51,820
Mr. Feng.

625
00:35:53,660 --> 00:35:54,540
Doesn't bother you, right?

626
00:35:54,540 --> 00:35:55,820
Can you chat a little more?

627
00:35:56,540 --> 00:35:57,420
No problem.

628
00:35:58,940 --> 00:35:59,940
I've always wanted to ask you.

629
00:36:00,380 --> 00:36:01,140
Last time,

630
00:36:01,140 --> 00:36:02,100
about the gossip problem,

631
00:36:02,300 --> 00:36:04,140
didn't have a big impact on you, right?

632
00:36:05,780 --> 00:36:07,260
The post has been almost completely deleted,

633
00:36:07,420 --> 00:36:08,420
it does have an impact.

634
00:36:09,380 --> 00:36:10,140
It seems like

635
00:36:11,620 --> 00:36:13,540
you only care about deleting posts,

636
00:36:14,420 --> 00:36:15,620
but didn't investigate

637
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:17,660
who made that post.

638
00:36:17,940 --> 00:36:18,780
Under investigation.

639
00:36:19,300 --> 00:36:20,860
The account that posted it first

640
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,180
is a newly registered user.

641
00:36:22,940 --> 00:36:24,380
We should sue the website too,

642
00:36:24,380 --> 00:36:25,740
only then can you get your personal information.

643
00:36:27,180 --> 00:36:28,140
If so, I know.

644
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:29,580
No need to claim anymore.

645
00:36:30,420 --> 00:36:31,420
I know who it is.

646
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:35,340
Previously,

647
00:36:35,660 --> 00:36:36,740
I continue to investigate

648
00:36:36,740 --> 00:36:38,100
Chunhui Steel industry problems.

649
00:36:38,420 --> 00:36:39,580
Offended quite a lot of people.

650
00:36:40,140 --> 00:36:41,820
They want to find a chance to take revenge on me.

651
00:36:42,140 --> 00:36:43,620
However, they didn't get the chance.

652
00:36:44,620 --> 00:36:45,620
This time it's a good opportunity.

653
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:46,980
You and me

654
00:36:46,980 --> 00:36:48,140
go in and out of the Four Seasons Hotel together,

655
00:36:49,300 --> 00:36:50,380
and caught by them,

656
00:36:50,860 --> 00:36:51,940
causing all of this to appear.

657
00:36:56,260 --> 00:36:57,380
How did you know?

658
00:36:58,540 --> 00:36:59,860
They contacted me.

659
00:37:00,660 --> 00:37:02,980
Asking me how I feel about being berated by the whole internet.

660
00:37:03,140 --> 00:37:04,260
Fun or not?

661
00:37:04,860 --> 00:37:06,180
Even shamelessly said,

662
00:37:06,740 --> 00:37:08,340
they had more shocking information.

663
00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:11,060
If I still disobey,

664
00:37:11,140 --> 00:37:12,420
then it will continue to reveal my information.

665
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:14,780
More shocking information?

666
00:37:14,860 --> 00:37:15,420
What?

667
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:17,740
Which one is more exciting?

668
00:37:18,420 --> 00:37:19,260
That day,

669
00:37:19,580 --> 00:37:21,260
what we experienced together,

670
00:37:21,420 --> 00:37:22,820
we ourselves know very clearly.

671
00:37:25,380 --> 00:37:26,380
If you want to say,

672
00:37:27,300 --> 00:37:28,900
This time I'm the one dragging you along.

673
00:37:29,740 --> 00:37:30,820
I should have looked for an opportunity

674
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,140
to formally apologize to you and Ke Ying.

675
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:35,620
No need.

676
00:37:39,820 --> 00:37:40,620
Actually

677
00:37:41,780 --> 00:37:43,340
I'm quite curious about you.

678
00:37:44,620 --> 00:37:45,540
Curious?

679
00:37:47,260 --> 00:37:48,260
Very curious.

680
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:51,820
Because of me and Ke Ying

681
00:37:52,580 --> 00:37:54,100
I've known him for too long.

682
00:37:54,940 --> 00:37:56,460
What kind of person is he,

683
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,180
I know very clearly.

684
00:38:04,660 --> 00:38:06,140
What kind of person is he?

685
00:38:09,580 --> 00:38:10,620
He is a person

686
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:12,860
who looks soft on the outside, but his heart is strong.

687
00:38:14,260 --> 00:38:15,180
When seen,

688
00:38:15,380 --> 00:38:16,540
it seems very soft,

689
00:38:16,780 --> 00:38:17,860
also very flexible.

690
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:21,060
However, in his heart,

691
00:38:21,260 --> 00:38:22,420
he is very opinionated.

692
00:38:23,300 --> 00:38:24,460
What he already believed,

693
00:38:25,100 --> 00:38:26,860
then he can keep doing it.

694
00:38:27,860 --> 00:38:29,540
He will not turn away even if he encounters any difficulties.

695
00:38:32,340 --> 00:38:33,140
So...

696
00:38:33,900 --> 00:38:35,340
So, I'm just really curious,

697
00:38:36,860 --> 00:38:38,580
What have you actually done to him?

698
00:38:39,460 --> 00:38:41,060
So that it can make him leave Yang Yuze.

699
00:38:42,540 --> 00:38:43,340
If

700
00:38:43,340 --> 00:38:44,460
as you said,

701
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:46,380
just chasing shamelessly as usual,

702
00:38:46,620 --> 00:38:48,340
it shouldn't be able to have an effect like this.

703
00:38:50,620 --> 00:38:51,380
Ke Ying...

704
00:38:52,340 --> 00:38:53,620
in many ways,

705
00:38:54,140 --> 00:38:55,580
his heart was quite hard.

706
00:38:57,620 --> 00:38:59,100
If it's just a small favor,

707
00:38:59,180 --> 00:39:00,660
shouldn't be able to touch him, right?

708
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:07,260
Women like this

709
00:39:07,740 --> 00:39:10,940
should have its own appeal for some men,

710
00:39:11,620 --> 00:39:12,420
Is that true?

711
00:39:21,620 --> 00:39:22,020
In that case,

712
00:39:22,020 --> 00:39:23,420
can i ask you a question

713
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,580
Ke Ying and Yang Yuze,

714
00:39:29,300 --> 00:39:30,940
Who was chasing whom at that time?

715
00:39:33,660 --> 00:39:34,860
Yang Yuze...

716
00:39:35,060 --> 00:39:37,100
at that time was a popular student at the medical university.

717
00:39:37,860 --> 00:39:39,380
There are many women who like it.

718
00:39:40,660 --> 00:39:43,380
I don't know what magic power Ke Ying has,

719
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,980
so that it can make Yang Yuze, who has not known Ke Ying for a long time

720
00:39:46,460 --> 00:39:48,180
fell in love with him deeply,

721
00:39:48,460 --> 00:39:49,620
not wavering in the slightest.

722
00:39:52,820 --> 00:39:53,740
So,

723
00:39:54,740 --> 00:39:56,100
This matter between Ke Ying and you

724
00:39:57,340 --> 00:39:59,380
was a huge blow to Yang Yuze.

725
00:40:01,620 --> 00:40:02,940
A few days ago, I met him.

726
00:40:04,340 --> 00:40:05,780
I almost didn't recognize him.

727
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:08,380
He looked pathetic.

728
00:40:11,980 --> 00:40:12,780
Is it true?

729
00:40:15,460 --> 00:40:16,020
When did you

730
00:40:16,020 --> 00:40:17,020
met Yang Yuze?

731
00:40:19,580 --> 00:40:20,620
A few days ago.

732
00:40:21,580 --> 00:40:22,300
When the Feng Group

733
00:40:22,300 --> 00:40:23,500
holding a press conference,

734
00:40:24,300 --> 00:40:25,980
I saw him outside the hotel.

735
00:40:27,540 --> 00:40:28,540
At that time,

736
00:40:28,540 --> 00:40:30,140
his mental condition was very bad.

737
00:40:30,860 --> 00:40:32,620
He looked dazed.

738
00:40:34,060 --> 00:40:35,180
Keep walking while avoiding people.

739
00:40:35,820 --> 00:40:36,740
Just be honest.

740
00:40:37,180 --> 00:40:38,420
When I saw him,

741
00:40:39,180 --> 00:40:40,460
my heart is very sad.

742
00:40:44,420 --> 00:40:45,340
Where are you going?

743
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,020
It was a little stuffy inside, I went out to get some fresh air.

744
00:41:00,260 --> 00:41:01,580
Sorry, Mr. Feng.

745
00:41:02,260 --> 00:41:03,740
Unknowingly I had chatted so much.

746
00:41:03,820 --> 00:41:04,620
Sorry to bother you.

747
00:41:16,820 --> 00:41:18,540
Well then, let's end it here today.

748
00:41:52,460 --> 00:41:53,140
Halo.

749
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,580
What are you doing?

750
00:41:55,860 --> 00:41:57,540
I'm a little tired after proctoring two exams.

751
00:41:57,940 --> 00:41:59,140
Eat something casually.

752
00:41:59,620 --> 00:42:00,900
Are you still back at the company?

753
00:42:01,380 --> 00:42:02,580
I didn't come back this afternoon.

754
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:04,420
I now want to find a place

755
00:42:04,420 --> 00:42:05,260
to do spa.

756
00:42:05,260 --> 00:42:06,140
Relax for a moment.

757
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:08,020
Okay.

758
00:42:08,620 --> 00:42:09,460
It just depends on you.

759
00:42:12,940 --> 00:42:13,620
Ying.

760
00:42:15,780 --> 00:42:16,540
Why?

761
00:42:16,780 --> 00:42:17,780
Is there anything else?

762
00:42:20,020 --> 00:42:20,860
There isn't any.

763
00:42:22,140 --> 00:42:23,340
Just miss you a little.

764
00:43:04,020 --> 00:43:04,860
Oh, yes, Gang,

765
00:43:05,380 --> 00:43:06,660
My treatment will take a very long time.

766
00:43:06,820 --> 00:43:08,580
How about you go find a place to rest for a while?

767
00:43:08,580 --> 00:43:09,420
Just pick me up later.

768
00:43:09,860 --> 00:43:10,940
It's okay, Miss Ke.

769
00:43:10,940 --> 00:43:12,020
I'll wait for you in the car.

770
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:43,140
