00:01:34,060 --> 00:01:35,740
Do you feel him

4
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:37,380
very similar to someone?

5
00:01:38,020 --> 00:01:38,940
Who?

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,540
Shen Shijie.

7
00:01:44,740 --> 00:01:45,860
Kak Jie?

8
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:48,380
How can Brother Jie compare to Mr. Feng?

9
00:01:48,380 --> 00:01:50,100
The difference is like heaven and earth.

10
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:01,620
Bu Hou.

11
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:02,420
Bu Hou.

12
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,420
Take it quickly. One big, one small, one of each.

13
00:02:05,580 --> 00:02:07,740
Our department is very stingy.

14
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:09,980
It is better to provide holiday allowance.

15
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,500
However, it doesn't matter.

16
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:13,260
Anyway, I'm going to my mother's house tomorrow,

17
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,580
so, there is no need to buy any more handicrafts.

18
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:16,140
Two, right?

19
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,540
That's right, two.

20
00:02:20,620 --> 00:02:21,380
Bu Hou.

21
00:02:22,300 --> 00:02:23,380
That time you said,

22
00:02:23,380 --> 00:02:25,300
Your mother took the wrong medicine to lower blood sugar levels.

23
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,700
How is it now?

24
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:29,100
After being taken to the hospital and given glucose, it was fine.

25
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:32,580
It seems like his blood sugar has suddenly dropped drastically, which is why he's dizzy.

26
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:34,180
Now he is very healthy.

27
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:37,100
There aren't any other bad reactions either, right?

28
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:39,020
It seems like there really isn't one.

29
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:42,260
However, his blood pressure is now lower than before.

30
00:02:42,740 --> 00:02:43,620
Thank you, Mrs. Ke,

31
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:44,660
you're still thinking about it.

32
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:46,300
That's good then.

38

What medicine do you need?

39
00:03:28,420 --> 00:03:29,340
Is there any hypertension medication?

40
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:30,540
It is here.

41
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,140
Please take a look at this hypertension medication.

42
00:03:41,140 --> 00:03:41,660
Thank You.

Why are you coming home so early?

49
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:06,980
I wake up early,

50
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:08,580
want to go home and eat your cooking.

51
00:05:09,260 --> 00:05:10,700
Want to eat Mom's cooking, huh?

52
00:05:10,700 --> 00:05:11,740
Then, come here quickly.

53
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:13,060
Call your father to eat together.

54
00:05:13,060 --> 00:05:15,220
I had to shout at him many times for breakfast.

55
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:40,860
Hello, is this the accommodation center?

56
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,980

82
00:08:24,340 --> 00:08:25,220
What's wrong with dad?

83
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:28,100
Do not panic.

84
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,940
I'll be right there.

85
00:08:29,980 --> 00:08:31,860

Mother.

109
00:09:57,460 --> 00:09:58,900
I also don't know what the condition is.

110
00:09:58,900 --> 00:10:00,220
Under inspection.

111
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:03,220
When you came home this morning, your father was still fine.

112
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:06,100
At noon, he said he wanted to take medicine,

113
00:10:06,100 --> 00:10:07,060
then lie down for a while.

114
00:10:07,580 --> 00:10:09,260
However, when I woke up I immediately screamed dizzy.

115
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:10,700
I told him to sleep again.

116
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:13,180
However, he insisted on getting up.

117
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:15,740
As soon as he stood up he immediately fainted.

118
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:17,340
Mother, Mother, Mother.

119
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:18,620
It's definitely okay.

120
00:10:19,100 --> 00:10:21,180
Dad will definitely be okay. Calm down, okay?

121
00:10:21,340 --> 00:10:21,740
Mother.

122
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,900
I also don't know why this could happen.

123
00:10:24,340 --> 00:10:25,620
I went in to see it earlier.

124
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:27,180
Uncle's condition is still stable.

125
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:28,300

129
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:22,140
Thank you, thank you.

130
00:11:22,180 --> 00:11:22,900
You slowly, slowly.

131
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,940
Thank you, son. Thank you.

132
00:11:25,380 --> 00:11:26,740
You slowly, slowly.

133
00:11:29,580 --> 00:11:30,860
Where do you want to go?

134
00:11:31,180 --> 00:11:32,420
To the hospital.

135
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:36,180
Go to the hospital yourself?

136
00:11:36,580 --> 00:11:39,180
Wh... why isn't anyone accompanying you?

137
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:40,780
All my children are busy.

138
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,260
Just need to turn in front then arrive.

139
00:11:50,380 --> 00:11:51,140
Okay.

140
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:53,060
You slowly, yes.

141
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:54,500
- Thank You. - I go first.

142
00:11:54,660 --> 00:11:55,820
I still have work.

143
00:11:56,180 --> 00:11:57,420
You slowly, yes, Grandma.

144
00:11:57,420 --> 00:11:57,940
Good.

145
00:12:07,700 --> 00:12:08,820
It's so old,

146
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:10,580
Grandma went to the hospital without being accompanied.

147
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:12,620
All those kids

148
00:12:13,060 --> 00:12:15,140
are animals without conscience.

149
00:12:21,580 --> 00:12:22,700
Sorry, Mr. Feng.

150
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,060
I got a little emotional.

151
00:12:28,060 --> 00:12:28,860
Gang.

152
00:12:30,740 --> 00:12:31,980
Go buy two bottles of water, I'm thirsty.

153
00:12:46,820 --> 00:12:48,660
I think you once said that you were an orphan.

154
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,700
What happened?

155
00:12:53,540 --> 00:12:54,540
I also do not know...

156
00:12:55,140 --> 00:12:56,660
Actually, am I an orphan or not?

157
00:12:57,540 --> 00:13:00,300
When I was little I was kidnapped and sold,

158
00:13:01,140 --> 00:13:02,620
At that time I couldn't remember anything.

159
00:13:02,620 --> 00:13:05,260
My adoptive father said, when he first met me,

160
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:07,660
there was a pair of dust goggles hanging around my neck.

161
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,180
My parents are probably in Nanzhou.

162
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:11,580
Just such a small hint.

163
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
Still haven't found it?

164
00:13:15,220 --> 00:13:15,860
Not yet.

165
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:19,220
However, I feel like they must be very healthy,

166
00:13:19,420 --> 00:13:20,380
not too old either.

167
00:13:21,020 --> 00:13:22,140
After I found them,

168
00:13:22,860 --> 00:13:23,940
I will be devoted to them.

169
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:32,660
Road.

170
00:13:34,940 --> 00:13:35,620
Can't wait any longer?

171
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:37,380
I have a meeting, I'm not in a rush.

172
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,380
Good.

173
00:14:09,900 --> 00:14:10,940
Sorry,

174
00:14:12,260 --> 00:14:12,860
Ayah.

175
00:14:26,820 --> 00:14:27,740
Trust me.

176
00:14:31,140 --> 00:14:33,020
Everything will get better.

177
00:14:49,820 --> 00:14:50,660
What is the condition?

178
00:14:59,060 --> 00:15:00,380
Still unconscious.

179
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:02,940
What about my mother?

180
00:15:03,380 --> 00:15:04,860
His mood had improved a lot.

181
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:08,020
I told him to go home and rest well tonight.

182
00:15:08,020 --> 00:15:08,980
It'll come again tomorrow.

183
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:12,300
If you have nothing else to do, you can go home first.

184
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:13,340
Just me here.

185
00:16:11,740 --> 00:16:12,620
Surface.

186
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,700
Can you take leave?

187
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:17,020
Leave?

188
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:22,940
Come on, let's have a wedding trip.

189
00:16:25,340 --> 00:16:26,420
Now?

190
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:28,820
After my father recovered.

191
00:16:30,740 --> 00:16:31,500
Good.

192
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:48,380
We have conducted a statistical survey

193
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:49,460
stock pawnshop carried out

194
00:16:49,460 --> 00:16:50,820
major shareholders.

195
00:16:50,900 --> 00:16:52,620
Through analysis of the use of funds,

196
00:16:52,660 --> 00:16:55,500
we found that 13 percent

197
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:56,460
funds from stock pawnshops

198
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:58,340
used for company development.

199
00:16:58,340 --> 00:17:01,780
For example, increasing financial support for granting employee stock options.

200
00:17:01,780 --> 00:17:03,740
About 85 percent funding

201
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:06,300
used by the parent company as a liquid asset,

202
00:17:06,780 --> 00:17:08,180
as well as for mergers and acquisitions.

203
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:11,020
Only less than 3 percent of funds

204
00:17:11,460 --> 00:17:12,780
which is used for individual production.

205
00:17:13,980 --> 00:17:16,420
We plan to submit a true statistical report soon

206
00:17:16,700 --> 00:17:18,340
on the Municipal Securities Supervisory Commission.

207
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:19,820
Chairman of the Board of Directors, what do you think?

208
00:17:23,500 --> 00:17:24,620
This problem...

209
00:17:25,260 --> 00:17:27,140
has been discussed at regular meetings

210
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:28,540
held by the president at that time.

211
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:30,380
Just reported it.

212
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:39,020
Speaking of this Securities Regulatory Commission,

213
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,580
I heard it two days ago

214
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,740
it seems like they made an announcement,

215
00:17:43,740 --> 00:17:44,900
about

216
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:49,220
improve coordination of companies with high risk of stock pawning.

217
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:51,620
Will not conduct litigation or freeze accounts again.

218
00:17:52,020 --> 00:17:52,900
Documents on this...

219
00:17:53,580 --> 00:17:54,900
Why have I never seen it?

220
00:17:56,260 --> 00:17:58,180
We just received this announcement today.

221
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:58,900
Where are the documents?

222
00:18:00,140 --> 00:18:01,260
At the table of the Chairman of the Board of Directors.

223
00:18:17,220 --> 00:18:18,700
In the future, documents like this

224
00:18:18,860 --> 00:18:20,980
must be handed over to me immediately.

225
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:30,460
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Chairman of the Board of Directors,

226
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:32,100
Next there are two more things.

227
00:18:32,100 --> 00:18:33,300
You must also attend.

228
00:18:33,340 --> 00:18:34,140
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

229
00:18:35,780 --> 00:18:36,380
Mr. Feng.

230
00:18:36,380 --> 00:18:37,300
Where are we going?

231
00:18:37,860 --> 00:18:39,140
Where do you usually eat?

232
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,260
Usually I...

233
00:18:42,260 --> 00:18:44,260
Master Feng, water.

234
00:18:50,780 --> 00:18:51,660
Are you running back?

235
00:18:54,260 --> 00:18:55,060
Take it easy.

236
00:18:55,460 --> 00:18:56,220
You go with me.

237
00:18:56,500 --> 00:18:57,140
Good.

238
00:18:58,500 --> 00:18:59,380
- Clean it up, okay? - Chairman of the Board of Directors.

239
00:18:59,380 --> 00:19:00,580
- I'll take a bottle of water, okay? - Chairman of the Board of Directors.

240
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:05,180
Drink water.

241
00:19:34,620 --> 00:19:35,340
Bos.

242
00:19:35,340 --> 00:19:37,060
It's here, here.

243
00:19:37,460 --> 00:19:39,620
The ingredients are fresh, also pay attention to the cooking method.

244
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,300
Most importantly, it's cheap.

245
00:19:52,380 --> 00:19:53,580
Sis Wu?

246
00:19:53,740 --> 00:19:54,980
Don't be too flashy.

247
00:19:55,340 --> 00:19:57,220
Why did you park your motorbike in the middle of the road again?

248
00:19:57,220 --> 00:19:58,380
How many times have I told you?

249
00:19:58,380 --> 00:19:59,700
You're looking for trouble, aren't you?

250
00:19:59,700 --> 00:20:01,180
Your character needs to be improved.

251
00:20:01,180 --> 00:20:01,900
no,

252
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,620
Hu Zi's motorbike broke down.

253
00:20:03,740 --> 00:20:04,620
Damaged?

254
00:20:05,220 --> 00:20:06,220
Let me see.

255
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:06,900
Let me see.

256
00:20:07,020 --> 00:20:08,060
Can't turn on.

257
00:20:09,020 --> 00:20:09,580
Can't turn it on?

258
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:10,500
This is Sis Wu.

259
00:20:22,540 --> 00:20:23,940
There is no problem with the gas tank.

260
00:20:24,660 --> 00:20:25,500
Can't turn on.

261
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,220
Is there anything loose at the bottom?

262
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:32,980
Just fix it.

263
00:20:33,100 --> 00:20:34,100
Like this,

264
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:36,100
You look for Huang, you can get a discount if you mention my name.

265
00:20:36,100 --> 00:20:37,300
However, you also can't discount much.

266
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:39,300
Huang open prices start at 300 yuan.

267
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:40,180
Three hundred?

268
00:20:42,340 --> 00:20:42,940
I forget.

269
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:44,260
I introduce to you,

270
00:20:44,500 --> 00:20:45,500
he is my boss.

271
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:47,380
He is chairman of the board of directors.

272
00:20:47,540 --> 00:20:49,060
Chairman of the board of directors of a public company.

273
00:20:49,220 --> 00:20:50,340
The luck is good,

274
00:20:50,380 --> 00:20:51,660
maybe that's how touching it is...

275
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:53,540
Right, right?

276
00:20:55,820 --> 00:20:56,860
Slow down, Boss.

277
00:20:57,660 --> 00:20:58,660
Try it.

278
00:20:59,420 --> 00:21:00,700
Try.

279
00:21:06,860 --> 00:21:08,140
I told you, right?

280
00:21:08,540 --> 00:21:09,820
Come on, eat quickly, I'm hungry.

281
00:21:09,820 --> 00:21:10,340
Eat!

282
00:21:10,340 --> 00:21:11,860
Today my sister is treating me.

283
00:21:12,020 --> 00:21:14,540
Everyone, come on, come in!

284
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:15,540
Good!

285
00:21:16,020 --> 00:21:17,100
- Thank you, Boss. - Thank you, Boss.

286
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:18,740
Come on, come on.

287
00:21:29,020 --> 00:21:29,700
Road!

288
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:41,220
I...

289
00:21:41,780 --> 00:21:42,900
My boss is treating me.

290
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,740
Order whatever you want.

291
00:21:45,740 --> 00:21:47,420
Drink as much as you like.

292
00:21:47,740 --> 00:21:49,420
However, shouldn't you guys say something?

293
00:21:49,420 --> 00:21:51,300
- Thank you, Boss! - Thank you, Boss!

294
00:21:51,300 --> 00:21:52,500
- Come on. - Together.

295
00:21:54,420 --> 00:21:55,340
Look at you guys,

296
00:21:55,340 --> 00:21:56,540
all of them are like bandits.

297
00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,540
If you have received your order, don't touch the beer, okay?

298
00:21:58,860 --> 00:22:00,380
- No, no. - No.

299
00:22:00,380 --> 00:22:01,100
Gangzi.

300
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:03,060
Don't you still have one more order today?

301
00:22:09,060 --> 00:22:10,420
I want to go take care of work.

302
00:22:11,340 --> 00:22:12,100
Boss, you are...

303
00:22:12,260 --> 00:22:12,860
You guys just keep going.

304
00:22:12,860 --> 00:22:13,420
I will be right back.

305
00:22:13,420 --> 00:22:14,260
Cepat, ya, Kak.

306
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,020
- Sit down. - Sit down.

307
00:22:21,740 --> 00:22:22,860
Very fast, yes, you guys.

308
00:22:22,860 --> 00:22:23,980
I'm really sick.

309
00:22:24,740 --> 00:22:26,140
Severe pain.

310
00:22:26,300 --> 00:22:27,860
My head is very dizzy.

311
00:22:28,100 --> 00:22:29,860
My eyes are full of little stars.

312
00:22:30,500 --> 00:22:31,900
Today is a half day break,

313
00:22:32,260 --> 00:22:33,540
Half a day's rest.

314
00:22:34,420 --> 00:22:35,140
Siang.

315
00:22:36,340 --> 00:22:37,660
Baldy, come have a beer.

316
00:22:38,420 --> 00:22:40,380
Come, come, come.

317
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:42,140
- Drink beer. - Drink beer.

318
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:42,780
Spend it.

319
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:43,620
Good.

320
00:22:46,500 --> 00:22:48,020
Your clothes are not bad, aren't they?

321
00:22:48,100 --> 00:22:48,980
This...

322
00:22:49,380 --> 00:22:50,380
the company that provides it.

323
00:22:51,380 --> 00:22:52,260
Branded.

324
00:22:54,900 --> 00:22:56,540
- Cheers! - Cheers.

325
00:22:56,540 --> 00:22:56,900
Drink more.

326
00:22:56,900 --> 00:22:57,980
- Long time no see. - Long time no see.

327
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,060
Eat it.

328
00:22:59,260 --> 00:23:00,100
Use hands.

329
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,900
When have you ever not eaten as much as you like?

330
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:02,540
Correct.

331
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:03,900
When have you ever not eaten as much as you like?

332
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,620
You should eat more.

333
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:07,540
True, or not?

334
00:23:07,540 --> 00:23:08,900
He eats quite a lot.

335
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:11,900
Sis.

336
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:13,420
- Come on, come on, come on. - Drink.

337
00:23:16,580 --> 00:23:17,380
You're back.

338
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:18,060
Mari.

339
00:23:18,140 --> 00:23:19,140
I made another toast to my boss.

340
00:23:19,260 --> 00:23:20,820
- Come on, come on. - Come on, come on.

341
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,420
Bos.

342
00:23:22,020 --> 00:23:22,740
- Bunch. - Bunch.

343
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,900
- Thank you, Boss. - Thank you, Boss.

344
00:23:25,900 --> 00:23:26,740
I hope the boss becomes more handsome.

345
00:23:26,740 --> 00:23:27,780
We pray for the Boss.

346
00:23:31,540 --> 00:23:31,980
Sis Wu.

347
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:32,980
- Punish him. - Punish him.

348
00:23:33,900 --> 00:23:35,580
If that's the case, I won't hesitate.

349
00:23:39,420 --> 00:23:40,660
I'm sorry.

350
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:02,740
I won't hesitate.

351
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:20,340
Is there any business looking for me?

352
00:24:22,420 --> 00:24:24,020
My father had to go out of town for treatment.

353
00:24:24,820 --> 00:24:26,140
I want to ask Mr. Feng,

354
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,220
ok, no?

355
00:24:30,540 --> 00:24:31,420
I won't go.

356
00:24:33,620 --> 00:24:34,860
I will continue to live in Nanzhou.

357
00:24:39,660 --> 00:24:40,500
Make a bet.

358
00:24:41,060 --> 00:24:42,500
Now our scores are tied, two equal.

359
00:24:44,060 --> 00:24:45,020
If you win,

360
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:47,260
I will agree with you.

361
00:24:48,900 --> 00:24:50,540
Pool betting? Come on.

362
00:24:52,900 --> 00:24:53,420
Sister Ke.

363
00:24:54,580 --> 00:24:55,420
Bet I win.

364
00:24:55,860 --> 00:24:57,900
On this island, the person who can defeat me has not yet been born.

365
00:25:11,300 --> 00:25:12,380
I can't afford to bet.

366
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:15,420
My father is really seriously ill.

367
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:18,140
I hope you can be more tolerant.

368
00:25:19,980 --> 00:25:21,660
You shouldn't have a choice, right?

369
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:29,420
between us,

370
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:30,900
choose one.

371
00:25:31,540 --> 00:25:32,580
Who won?

372
00:25:37,860 --> 00:25:38,860
I bet you win.

373
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:44,980
Can't give up.

374
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:45,860
Whoever gives in, is the loser.

375
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:39,060
He won.

376
00:26:39,420 --> 00:26:40,260
Go away.

377
00:26:45,340 --> 00:26:46,540
Thank You.

378
00:26:51,940 --> 00:26:52,660
Thank You.

379
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:58,460
Mr. Feng.

380
00:26:58,460 --> 00:26:59,340
Don't mind, okay?

381
00:26:59,660 --> 00:27:01,220
We agreed earlier that whoever gives in is the loser.

382
00:27:02,180 --> 00:27:03,340
Tell you what, I'll treat you to a drink.

383
00:27:03,500 --> 00:27:05,220
Come on, bring the wine here.

384
00:28:03,020 --> 00:28:03,860
Morning, Chairman of the Board of Directors.

385
00:28:08,700 --> 00:28:09,660
What do you see?

386
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:10,860
I see...

387
00:28:11,780 --> 00:28:12,860
you're handsome.

388
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:27,700
Look at this kennel of yours.

389
00:28:33,740 --> 00:28:34,260
I...

390
00:28:35,220 --> 00:28:36,260
only come home at night.

391
00:28:37,340 --> 00:28:38,660
As soon as I got home I went straight to sleep.

392
00:28:39,460 --> 00:28:41,700
Usually during the day I'm always at the office, not here either.

393
00:28:50,220 --> 00:28:51,540
The same model as Lawrence's.

394
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:54,100
Do you know this too?

395
00:28:55,340 --> 00:28:56,500
I used to have one too.

396
00:29:00,420 --> 00:29:01,100
Keren.

397
00:29:10,020 --> 00:29:10,620
Hello, Baldy.

398
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:12,660
Were you drunk last night too?

399
00:29:13,460 --> 00:29:15,300
Didn't I tell you to take Master Feng home?

400
00:29:16,380 --> 00:29:17,660
Why did you take him to my house?

401
00:29:17,660 --> 00:29:20,060
Sis, who dares to drive that car?

402
00:29:20,060 --> 00:29:21,900
If it gets scratched, all my hard work will be in vain.

403
00:29:22,140 --> 00:29:22,980
Where's the car?

404
00:29:24,460 --> 00:29:25,740
Still in place.

405
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:51,900
Enter.

406
00:29:53,220 --> 00:29:54,020
Bos.

407
00:29:54,740 --> 00:29:55,700
Mr. Feng, You are busy, yes.

408
00:29:55,700 --> 00:29:56,940
If that's the case, I'll go back first.

409
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,580
No problem, come on in.

410
00:30:00,740 --> 00:30:02,060
(An autopsy is an experience.)

411
00:30:02,060 --> 00:30:03,580
(Ballistics testing is an experiment.)

412
00:30:03,620 --> 00:30:04,500
(Which do you think is more accurate?)

413
00:30:04,500 --> 00:30:06,020
(Let's not argue anymore.)

414
00:30:06,140 --> 00:30:07,860
(Enter the experimental data into the computer)

415
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:08,900
(and do a 3D simulation.)

416
00:30:11,460 --> 00:30:12,420
This is pretty good.

417
00:30:19,380 --> 00:30:20,540
No problem, just talk.

418
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:22,940
Mr. Feng.

419
00:30:23,380 --> 00:30:25,540
I want permission tonight.

420
00:30:26,500 --> 00:30:27,500
What's the matter?

421
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,740
My old boss,

422
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:32,220
You Qiang,

423
00:30:32,580 --> 00:30:33,580
who always followed second uncle.

424
00:30:33,580 --> 00:30:34,300
Do you know him?

425
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,700
In the past, I always followed Sis Qiang.

426
00:30:38,140 --> 00:30:39,340
Then, finally

427
00:30:39,340 --> 00:30:41,700
Brother Dao Jian borrowed me for a few days, then I became your driver.

428
00:30:47,700 --> 00:30:49,260
Very busy, yes.

429
00:30:51,620 --> 00:30:52,780
you don't know,

430
00:30:53,460 --> 00:30:55,980
your car is too expensive.

431
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:58,540
Usually I drive your car full of fear,

432
00:30:58,540 --> 00:30:59,900
I'm so scared I'll get scratched.

433
00:30:59,900 --> 00:31:00,300
I...

434
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:01,740
if you talk harshly,

435
00:31:01,740 --> 00:31:03,060
Even if I sell myself, I can't afford it.

436
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:04,020
Don't want to be my driver anymore?

437
00:31:04,020 --> 00:31:04,900
No, no, no.

438
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:06,620
That is not what I mean.

439
00:31:07,620 --> 00:31:08,420
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

440
00:31:08,740 --> 00:31:11,220
Last night Sis Qiang called me,

441
00:31:11,740 --> 00:31:12,860
He said there was an urgent matter.

442
00:31:13,100 --> 00:31:13,940
I thought,

443
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,820
he used to look after me so well,

444
00:31:15,820 --> 00:31:17,380
if I don't go, it's a bit inappropriate.

445
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,620
Moreover,

446
00:31:18,620 --> 00:31:20,100
In the past, Sis Qiang was also very kind to me,

447
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:21,780
like how you treat me now.

448
00:31:23,420 --> 00:31:24,660
What urgent business?

449
00:31:25,420 --> 00:31:26,100
Still don't know.

450
00:31:27,900 --> 00:31:28,540
Go away.

451
00:31:29,460 --> 00:31:30,340
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

452
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:02,980
What's wrong with your hand?

453
00:32:03,100 --> 00:32:04,420
Finished shift last night,

454
00:32:04,940 --> 00:32:07,580
when I was just about to get into the car in the basement parking lot,

455
00:32:07,940 --> 00:32:09,940
don't know where a burly man appeared from,

456
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,700
he ran towards me carrying a stick.

457
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:13,460
I blocked it with my hand like this,

458
00:32:13,980 --> 00:32:15,420
then my bones immediately broke.

459
00:32:15,540 --> 00:32:16,740
Iron rod.

460
00:32:17,260 --> 00:32:18,980
It hurt until I immediately fainted.

461
00:32:19,100 --> 00:32:20,540
Luckily the security guard came straight away

462
00:32:20,740 --> 00:32:22,100
and took me to the hospital.

463
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,820
No, don't touch it.

464
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,100
Sick.

465
00:32:27,620 --> 00:32:29,100
Do you know who did it?

466
00:32:30,380 --> 00:32:32,260
The police have also seen CCTV footage.

467
00:32:32,500 --> 00:32:33,340
That person

468
00:32:33,620 --> 00:32:34,660
riding a motorbike,

469
00:32:35,060 --> 00:32:36,100
wearing a helmet,

470
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,900
I really don't see who it is.

471
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,340
The police asked

472
00:32:39,420 --> 00:32:40,980
did I offend anyone?

473
00:32:41,620 --> 00:32:43,020
After I thought hard,

474
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:44,420
that's not possible.

475
00:32:44,780 --> 00:32:45,980
You know me too.

476
00:32:46,220 --> 00:32:47,620
I'm that person

477
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,380
very friendly, isn't it?

478
00:32:49,380 --> 00:32:51,740
Also very low self esteem in the office.

479
00:32:52,540 --> 00:32:54,380
Everyone likes and respects me,

480
00:32:54,660 --> 00:32:56,220
Who exactly am I offending?

481
00:32:56,940 --> 00:32:57,980
maybe,

482
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:00,700
maybe one of the officers I fired.

483
00:33:00,900 --> 00:33:02,540
Revenge, this is pure revenge.

484
00:33:03,940 --> 00:33:05,060
I've given orders,

485
00:33:05,060 --> 00:33:06,180
absolute command,

486
00:33:06,420 --> 00:33:08,140
order the company's Security Department

487
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:09,220
cooperate with the police

488
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,460
to investigate who that person is!

489
00:33:11,660 --> 00:33:12,340
Investigate!

490
00:33:12,780 --> 00:33:13,820
Very cruel.

491
00:33:15,540 --> 00:33:16,780
It must be investigated until it is found.

492
00:33:18,580 --> 00:33:19,620
Must be investigated.

493
00:33:19,900 --> 00:33:21,180
It's also difficult to urinate.

494
00:33:22,140 --> 00:33:22,940
You just carry on.

495
00:33:45,900 --> 00:33:46,260
Mother.

496
00:33:46,900 --> 00:33:48,260
I withdrew some cash for you.

497
00:33:48,620 --> 00:33:49,940
I put it in your suitcase,

498
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:50,780
remember yourself, okay?

499
00:33:51,740 --> 00:33:53,420
What are you giving me cash for?

500
00:33:54,340 --> 00:33:55,180
Will not apply.

501
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,180
Take it, it's not heavy either.

502
00:34:00,140 --> 00:34:02,220
Why give me so much money?

503
00:34:02,820 --> 00:34:04,620
Aren't you the one who said, be frugal at home, wasteful when traveling?

504
00:34:04,620 --> 00:34:05,740
I remember everything.

505
00:34:05,980 --> 00:34:07,100
You're basic,

506
00:34:07,340 --> 00:34:08,660
you're too old-fashioned.

507
00:34:08,660 --> 00:34:10,820
Now who still travels with cash?

508
00:34:10,820 --> 00:34:12,940
Just needing one cellphone is enough.

509
00:34:13,620 --> 00:34:15,260
Besides, I still have an ATM card.

510
00:34:15,260 --> 00:34:17,020
Mom, don't bring up cell phones again.

511
00:34:17,020 --> 00:34:18,820
Do you still remember that time I lost my cell phone?

512
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:20,500
There's not a penny in my pocket.

513
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:22,660
I almost had to beg for food.

514
00:34:23,300 --> 00:34:25,100
It's better to bring a little money for peace of mind.

515
00:34:25,220 --> 00:34:26,460
No need.

516
00:34:26,460 --> 00:34:28,660
Didn't you bring too few clothes?

517
00:34:28,820 --> 00:34:30,340
No, just a few days.

518
00:34:30,620 --> 00:34:32,180
What if the weather changes?

519
00:34:32,180 --> 00:34:33,420
Bring more.

520
00:34:34,020 --> 00:34:35,100
I've looked at the weather forecast.

521
00:34:35,100 --> 00:34:36,500
These two days the weather has been quite good.

522
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,380
Current weather forecasts are inaccurate.

523
00:34:38,540 --> 00:34:41,500
What if the weather changes and dad passes out again?

524
00:34:42,620 --> 00:34:44,900
Your father just has high blood pressure.

525
00:34:44,900 --> 00:34:46,060
Not a big deal.

526
00:34:47,620 --> 00:34:49,260
I've brought all the medicine.

527
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:51,780
Still not enough, better bring more.

528
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:53,460
Besides, you weren't the one who brought it up, there was Yuze.

529
00:34:55,180 --> 00:34:56,340
Ying Ying.

530
00:34:56,340 --> 00:34:57,820
Don't bother me anymore.

531
00:34:57,820 --> 00:34:59,820
I've been thinking about what I should bring from the start.

532
00:34:59,820 --> 00:35:00,860
You go quickly,

533
00:35:01,180 --> 00:35:02,780
just do your job.

534
00:35:02,940 --> 00:35:03,780
Hurry up.

535
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:05,380
This kid.

536
00:35:21,420 --> 00:35:22,180
Good.

537
00:35:23,340 --> 00:35:24,380
Pretty good.

538
00:35:27,380 --> 00:35:28,460
Mother and father.

539
00:35:28,740 --> 00:35:31,300
The hospitals and doctors there have already been arranged.

540
00:35:31,540 --> 00:35:33,060
If you have any questions, just look for Yuze.

541
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,260
He will accompany you, don't worry.

542
00:35:34,260 --> 00:35:34,540
Good.

543
00:35:34,540 --> 00:35:35,460
Fine, yeah.

544
00:35:35,460 --> 00:35:36,300
Fine.

545
00:35:36,300 --> 00:35:38,300
Checking your health while on vacation.

546
00:35:38,300 --> 00:35:39,700
This plan is pretty good.

547
00:35:39,700 --> 00:35:40,220
Ayah,

548
00:35:40,220 --> 00:35:41,220
control your temperament.

549
00:35:41,220 --> 00:35:42,500
Don't always scold mother.

550
00:35:44,300 --> 00:35:46,580
When do I get angry with him?

551
00:35:46,580 --> 00:35:48,180
He's the one who always scolds me.

552
00:35:49,860 --> 00:35:50,340
You...

553
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,820
Have you brought my book?

554
00:35:54,340 --> 00:35:55,340
I forget.

555
00:35:55,340 --> 00:35:57,100
Left on the table at home.

556
00:35:58,220 --> 00:35:59,060
Look at you.

557
00:35:59,060 --> 00:36:00,180
I told you over and over again,

558
00:36:00,180 --> 00:36:02,300
still you forget. Base.

559
00:36:02,420 --> 00:36:03,740
Looking around.

560
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,100
Who scolded whom?

561
00:36:08,260 --> 00:36:09,180
Look.

562

Ying Ying.

565

You'll be home alone, we'll all be gone.

Don't let your work be delayed.

570
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:37,660
