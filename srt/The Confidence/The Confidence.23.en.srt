=Episode 23=

3
00:01:52,420 --> 00:01:53,380
Smooth, no?

4
00:01:54,860 --> 00:01:56,300
Why did you call him so late?

5
00:02:00,260 --> 00:02:01,620
You said ten minutes,

6
00:02:01,620 --> 00:02:02,820
not a minute or a second less.

7
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:05,340
Why?

8
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:08,010
He touched you?

9
00:02:12,940 --> 00:02:14,380
I've got the goods.

10
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:16,540
Come on, go quickly.

11
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:32,940
Do you still love me?

12
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,220
Do you still love me, Julia?

13
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,780
Julia.

14
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,660
Julia.

15
00:02:48,020 --> 00:02:49,460
Julia.

16
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,020
Hurry, hurry.

17
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:04,180
What's the situation inside?

18
00:04:05,380 --> 00:04:06,100
Who's that?

19
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:09,060
Someone came.

20
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,540
Fast.

21
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:12,420
Chase, chase!

22
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:14,740
There's a dog.

23
00:04:14,860 --> 00:04:15,620
- Hurry, hurry, hurry. - Hurry up.

24
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:16,460
Fast.

25
00:04:18,700 --> 00:04:19,490
Stop!

26
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,860
Hurry, hurry.

27
00:04:21,860 --> 00:04:22,340
Fast.

28
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:24,340
Stop!

29
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:27,300
Hurry, hurry.

30
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:34,220
Fast.

31
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:39,420
A little faster!

32
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:46,860
Hurry, wake up.

33
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,500
- Hurry, hurry, hurry. - A little faster, a little faster.

34
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:49,260
Fast.

35
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:08,580
I almost got chased by the dog.

36
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,380
everything is your fault.

37
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,060
What's the situation inside?

38
00:05:12,500 --> 00:05:13,500
Try to guess.

39
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:15,780
Guess your head.

40
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:16,300
Say it quickly,

41
00:05:16,300 --> 00:05:17,500
Don't deliberately create curiosity.

42
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:20,660
I've seen the raw material warehouse in there.

43
00:05:20,660 --> 00:05:22,060
Everything is empty.

44
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:28,500
Looks like my guess was correct.

45
00:05:42,100 --> 00:05:43,940
Someone sent me an anonymous email.

46
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,100
Anonymous email?

47
00:05:46,740 --> 00:05:48,060
A love letter, huh?

48
00:05:53,180 --> 00:05:54,060
This person

49
00:05:54,060 --> 00:05:55,820
I think I've seen it at a car show.

50
00:05:56,620 --> 00:05:57,580
That...

51
00:05:57,580 --> 00:05:59,340
new energy expert from America?

52
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:03,100
The car is a trap.

53
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:04,940
Regarding the transfer of funds,

54
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,060
investigate until it is clear.

55
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:16,260
This weather changes at will.

56
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:19,020
It's going to be a rainstorm.

57
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:22,620
My father said,

58
00:06:22,980 --> 00:06:24,740
a star will stay awake half the night.

59
00:06:24,740 --> 00:06:25,660
If it's going to rain,

60
00:06:25,660 --> 00:06:27,260
It rained for at least half the next night.

61
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,740
What are you doing? Very weird.

62
00:06:34,940 --> 00:06:35,740
I asked you.

63
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:42,900
I'm drawing you two naked.

64
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:43,940
Group Peppa Pig.

65
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:46,820
Here, look, who is this?

66
00:06:47,700 --> 00:06:48,660
Bro,

67
00:06:48,860 --> 00:06:50,500
You're too free, aren't you?

68
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:51,980
Take a look.

69
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:53,260
This,

70
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,220
Peppa Guo Bao.

71
00:06:57,260 --> 00:06:58,060
What surname are you?

72
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:01,380
He? He's in the same clan as pesticide.

73
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:03,100
- Pesticides? - You're looking for death, aren't you?

74
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,740
King pesticide, huh? [*a play on the name of the game Honor of Kings]

75
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,260
No, no, no.

76
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,620
Did you really write it?

77
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:08,460
Write, write, write, it doesn't matter.

78
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:09,740
Write, write the name.

79
00:07:09,740 --> 00:07:10,260
Yes,

80
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:11,020
This.

81
00:07:11,020 --> 00:07:11,980
Guo Jing.

82
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:13,140
Guo…

83
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:15,060
Guo Jing?

84
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,220
Queban,

85
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:19,580
This name is dashing too.

86
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:20,660
Pendekar Guo Jing.

87
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,380
He's a ronggeng shrimp.

88
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:24,140
Guo Jing.

89
00:07:29,140 --> 00:07:29,780
Guo Bao.

90
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:30,500
Here, here, here.

91
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,100
Look at this.

92
00:07:31,740 --> 00:07:32,420
This.

93
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:35,580
Brother Jin is really like a frog.

94
00:07:36,060 --> 00:07:37,180
Similar, right？

95
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:39,180
Here, here, here, let me write this one.

96
00:07:43,780 --> 00:07:45,740
Piao Yongjin.

97
00:07:53,580 --> 00:07:55,540
Why is there no movement inside at all?

98
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:03,340
Tell all teams to stay hidden,

99
00:08:03,340 --> 00:08:04,260
standby waiting for orders.

100
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:05,020
Good.

101
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:06,260
Kapten Xiao,

102
00:08:07,140 --> 00:08:07,940
let me see it.

103
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:29,980
My father really played a trick on me.

104
00:08:30,540 --> 00:08:31,500
Hurry, hurry. Dissolve, dissolve.

105
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,180
Let's go, let's go.

106
00:08:32,770 --> 00:08:33,650
Come on, go back inside.

107
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:34,500
Back inside, back inside.

108
00:08:34,580 --> 00:08:35,130
Of.

109
00:08:36,100 --> 00:08:37,700
(Wang Guo Bao; Guo Jing; Piao Yongjin)

110
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:41,180
(Wang Guo Bao; Guo Jing; Piao Yongjin)

111
00:08:56,620 --> 00:08:57,540
Kak Qiang.

112
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:00,060
Finally back too.

113
00:09:00,620 --> 00:09:02,580
Sis Jin, it's only night.

114
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:04,780
I know you guys can't take it anymore.

115
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:06,820
Put on your clothes,

116
00:09:07,220 --> 00:09:08,140
prepare things,

117
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:10,860
Today I will invite you to have fun.

118
00:09:11,780 --> 00:09:12,340
Sis,

119
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:13,540
the rain is so heavy,

120
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,580
where to go for fun?

121
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:16,380
You don't want to go, do you?

122
00:09:16,380 --> 00:09:17,300
Hurry up, hurry up.

123
00:09:17,300 --> 00:09:18,220
Hurry, hurry.

124
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,580
Wu, why are you silent?

125
00:09:20,580 --> 00:09:21,700
You also pack there.

126
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:22,620
I am done.

127
00:09:23,260 --> 00:09:23,940
It's finished?

128
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:30,140
Brother Qiang, you farted, didn't you?

129
00:09:30,580 --> 00:09:31,260
Where is there?

130
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:31,900
You.

131
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:36,340
Damn.

132
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:40,260
Good grief.

133
00:09:40,260 --> 00:09:41,740
Where was this trampled?

134
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:43,740
Qiang,

135
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,060
that's dog poop, right?

136
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:47,700
You will soon have a fortune.

137
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:48,940
Jin, I'll give you some.

138
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:50,100
Get rid of it, get rid of it.

139
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,140
You just keep it to yourself.

140
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,340
- Wu. - Hurry, hurry, hurry.

141
00:09:53,340 --> 00:09:54,060
Here, here, here.

142
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:55,780
Over here!

143
00:09:57,820 --> 00:09:59,100
Take it to the toilet,

144
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:01,500
Brush until the shoe base is clean.

145
00:10:01,580 --> 00:10:02,420
Brush until clean!

146
00:10:02,420 --> 00:10:03,580
Hurry up, hurry up.

147
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:05,300
Hurry, hurry.

148
00:10:08,860 --> 00:10:10,580
Qiang, he is really good.

149
00:10:24,460 --> 00:10:25,220
Kapten Xiao.

150
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,980
Inside there are three goods cars,

151
00:10:27,980 --> 00:10:29,900
exactly the same as the photo sent by the investigative team.

152
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,620
There are people inside, the number cannot be confirmed.

153
00:10:35,540 --> 00:10:36,860
The money is really here?

154
00:11:18,820 --> 00:11:28,460
(The goods are at Jialan Electrical Appliance Factory, Da Gang)

155
00:11:31,260 --> 00:11:32,900
(The goods are at Jialan Electrical Appliance Factory, Da Gang)

156
00:11:40,980 --> 00:11:42,060
Jin, I tell you,

157
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:43,620
sustenance in misfortune is still sustenance.

158
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,820
this is also a good sign.

159
00:11:44,820 --> 00:11:46,220
I gave it to you, you didn't even want it.

160
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:47,100
Done.

161
00:11:48,980 --> 00:11:49,620
You can, Wu.

162
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,620
Wear it, wear it.

163
00:11:50,780 --> 00:11:51,060
Ayo.

164
00:11:51,340 --> 00:11:52,540
I put it on for you.

165
00:11:53,940 --> 00:11:55,380
Agile too.

166
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,620
Of course.

167
00:11:57,020 --> 00:11:58,660
Is it clean yet?

168
00:11:58,660 --> 00:12:00,180
That's it, just look at it.

169
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:02,260
Qiang.

170
00:12:03,740 --> 00:12:05,900
Your little brother is very kind to you.

171
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:06,980
Of course.

172
00:12:07,100 --> 00:12:08,740
I taught him myself.

173
00:12:09,020 --> 00:12:10,460
I hope that Sis Qiang will make me rich.

174
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,180
All right, get in the car.

175
00:12:12,180 --> 00:12:12,660
Ayo.

176
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,460
Naik.

177
00:12:24,060 --> 00:12:24,820
Bureau Chief Liu,

178
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:27,060
all the cargo cars are still inside,

179
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:28,780
So far there has been no movement.

180
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:32,380
Wait.

181
00:12:33,020 --> 00:12:33,980
They have started to move.

182
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:35,180
Fast.

183
00:12:55,300 --> 00:12:55,980
Ahead there is an intersection.

184
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,380
Number one comes first, number two follows.

185
00:12:57,380 --> 00:12:58,020
Good.

186
00:13:10,420 --> 00:13:11,900
Number three is already on standby.

187
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:13,940
You're coming out of the city intersection.

188
00:13:14,340 --> 00:13:15,020
Good.

189
00:13:17,580 --> 00:13:18,660
What is the situation at the port?

190
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,380
Our members have arrived at the place.

191
00:13:21,340 --> 00:13:22,260
Tell everyone,

192
00:13:22,660 --> 00:13:23,740
increase alertness.

193
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:25,500
Pay attention to their counter-sensing movements.

194
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:27,100
Without orders from the Command Post,

195
00:13:27,420 --> 00:13:28,260
can't act!

196
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,860
Good.

197
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:36,620
Kapten Xiao,

198
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:37,300
meet.

199
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,220
The short message was sent from this transmitting station.

200
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:43,860
The nearest electronic equipment factory is called Jialan Electrical Equipment Factory.

201
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,740
That Time?

202
00:13:47,460 --> 00:13:49,500
Currently, this number is still moving in this area.

203
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:11,980
You have to think carefully,

204
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,180
this is related to

205
00:14:13,180 --> 00:14:14,940
failure or success of all these operations.

206
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,500
Just because of one anonymous short message,

207
00:14:17,500 --> 00:14:19,260
want to change the whole plan.

208
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,780
Don't you feel like this is playing around?

209
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:22,060
If it fails,

210
00:14:22,060 --> 00:14:23,700
How do we explain it to the investigative team?

211
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,060
Xiao Tongbin!

212
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:30,660
Bureau Chief Liu,

213
00:14:30,660 --> 00:14:32,220
what is Lu Er's situation?

214
00:14:32,300 --> 00:14:33,340
There is no movement whatsoever,

215
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:34,700
just playing mahjong since then.

216
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:36,060
What about Feng Meng?

217
00:14:36,060 --> 00:14:37,180
Didn't show up either.

218
00:14:37,700 --> 00:14:39,020
It's very quiet at my place.

219
00:14:39,020 --> 00:14:39,940
Then forget it,

220
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:40,940
I already understand.

221
00:14:41,820 --> 00:14:43,500
Xiao Tongbin, what do you want?

222
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:44,660
Calm down a bit.

223
00:14:44,820 --> 00:14:45,820
I'm very calm.

224
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:46,740
Bureau Chief Liu, you can rest assured.

225
00:14:47,180 --> 00:14:47,780
You…

226
00:14:52,660 --> 00:14:53,460
Please pay attention to the entire team,

227
00:14:53,460 --> 00:14:54,580
aku Xiao Tongbin.

228
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:56,180
Leave monitoring car number one,

229
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:57,020
listen to Captain Wang's command.

230
00:14:57,020 --> 00:14:58,380
The rest stop moving first,

231
00:14:58,380 --> 00:15:00,420
immediately go to Jialan Electric Appliance Factory.

232
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,820
Wang.

233
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:05,100
You change cars.

234
00:15:05,220 --> 00:15:07,620
Later, I will change the position of the cellphone location here.

235
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:09,300
You remain here to direct the operation.

236
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:09,900
Understand.

237
00:15:13,020 --> 00:15:14,540
Switch image to Da Gang,

238
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:15,940
keep a close eye on that phone.

239
00:15:16,180 --> 00:15:16,740
Understand.

240
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:21,460
(Jinlongtan Bathing Center)

241
00:15:51,860 --> 00:15:52,340
Kapten Xiao,

242
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:53,940
the cell phone signal was lost.

243
00:16:02,500 --> 00:16:02,980
Kapten Xiao.

244
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:05,980
Inside the factory, only two old men were left guarding the gate.

245
00:16:06,260 --> 00:16:08,140
He said there were five people staying here for two days.

246
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:09,700
An hour earlier they went by car,

247
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:10,460
the direction is not clear.

248
00:16:12,460 --> 00:16:13,420
Where do the five people live?

249
00:16:13,420 --> 00:16:14,060
Inside.

250
00:16:15,660 --> 00:16:16,620
Come on, let's see.

251
00:16:27,980 --> 00:16:28,620
Ayo,

252
00:16:29,700 --> 00:16:30,460
it's all down.

253
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,820
Had reached.

254
00:16:54,980 --> 00:16:55,580
Guo Bao.

255
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:56,780
Catch.

256
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:01,780
Qiang.

257
00:17:02,460 --> 00:17:03,020
Take it.

258
00:17:05,570 --> 00:17:06,050
You two.

259
00:17:10,540 --> 00:17:11,380
Listen.

260
00:17:11,380 --> 00:17:12,330
Three cars.

261
00:17:13,140 --> 00:17:14,050
you three,

262
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:15,020
one person one.

263
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:17,540
Take it to the designated place.

264
00:17:18,660 --> 00:17:21,020
Once arrived, the owner of the goods will give 50 thousand yuan.

265
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:24,050
You may be rich or not,

266
00:17:24,290 --> 00:17:25,500
depends on you.

267
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,330
Good.

268
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,050
Go up.

269
00:17:27,700 --> 00:17:28,220
Ayo.

270
00:17:29,380 --> 00:17:30,540
Sis Jin, what about me?

271
00:17:30,540 --> 00:17:31,700
You drive that one.

272
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:35,780
My money?

273
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,980
The numbers won't change, right?

274
00:17:36,980 --> 00:17:38,540
This time you got 3000 yuan.

275
00:17:39,660 --> 00:17:40,500
How much?

276
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:41,420
Three thousand.

277
00:17:43,660 --> 00:17:44,700
Three thousand?

278
00:17:44,700 --> 00:17:45,860
That's not a small amount.

279
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:48,260
You think you're lying to the kids, don't you?

280
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,260
Locked me up for so long,

281
00:17:50,420 --> 00:17:52,460
You think you're chasing away beggars, giving me 3000?

282
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:53,220
What are you saying?

283
00:17:53,220 --> 00:17:54,380
What do you think I said?

284
00:17:54,380 --> 00:17:55,060
Qiang,

285
00:17:55,060 --> 00:17:56,420
what's wrong with your little brother?

286
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:58,100
Wu, what the hell?

287
00:17:58,100 --> 00:17:59,260
How do you talk to Sis Jin?

288
00:17:59,500 --> 00:18:00,940
This is your first time.

289
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:01,980
Once you're proficient,

290
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,460
there will still be many opportunities in the future.

291
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,260
Wu, come here.

292
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:07,700
Here.

293
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:12,420
You're basic.

294
00:18:12,700 --> 00:18:14,980
The money is low, which means work this time

295
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,620
easy, harmless.

296
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:21,500
Your car is just for trickery, there's nothing in it,

297
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:23,060
understand?

298
00:18:23,140 --> 00:18:24,500
Mr. Feng…

299
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,460
Just do it wholeheartedly, that's enough

300
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:29,980
understand, no?

301
00:18:29,980 --> 00:18:30,660
That's enough, right?

302
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:31,180
Get ready to go.

303
00:18:32,260 --> 00:18:32,940
Okay.

304
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:33,780
Wu, do it well, okay?

305
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,420
Drive well,

306
00:18:34,420 --> 00:18:35,540
listen to Jin's words.

307
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:36,980
Jin.

308
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:46,340
You can too, Young One.

309
00:18:47,100 --> 00:18:48,180
Your temper is tough too.

310
00:18:49,940 --> 00:18:50,660
Take it.

311
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:58,140
I'll tell you, bro,

312
00:18:59,660 --> 00:19:01,260
There are lots of opportunities to make money.

313
00:19:01,980 --> 00:19:03,180
Don't get bored of life yet.

314
00:19:03,420 --> 00:19:04,700
You think they're easy, right?

315
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:06,500
Everything came from luck?

316
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:07,780
Every small and large road

317
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,980
there is a checkpoint for smuggling goods.

318
00:19:09,980 --> 00:19:11,140
Without a bill of lading from the port,

319
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,420
not only will all goods be confiscated,

320
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,580
the person will also be detained.

321
00:19:17,060 --> 00:19:17,620
Let's make it like this,

322
00:19:18,780 --> 00:19:19,620
nights like this,

323
00:19:19,620 --> 00:19:20,780
going out once is not easy either.

324
00:19:21,940 --> 00:19:23,220
I'll add another 2000 for you.

325
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,940
This time, let's just say we know the way,

326
00:19:25,940 --> 00:19:26,780
How?

327
00:19:28,300 --> 00:19:29,100
Take it.

328
00:19:30,060 --> 00:19:31,180
I'll give you another chance later.

329
00:19:33,660 --> 00:19:35,340
What is this junk phone?

330
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,980
This is a special cellphone for delivering goods,

331
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,420
can only receive telephone calls, cannot make calls.

332
00:19:38,660 --> 00:19:40,420
Then, if something happens,

333
00:19:40,860 --> 00:19:42,380
I can't call, what?

334
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:43,780
You don't need a phone,

335
00:19:44,660 --> 00:19:46,620
just listen to my call.

336
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,180
Which way do I go?

337
00:19:50,180 --> 00:19:51,020
Through the main road,

338
00:19:51,020 --> 00:19:51,860
toll road.

339
00:19:52,260 --> 00:19:53,420
Am I taking the main road?

340
00:19:53,420 --> 00:19:54,020
Of course.

341
00:19:54,020 --> 00:19:55,180
Border checks for smuggling are all on the main road,

342
00:19:55,180 --> 00:19:56,540
are you telling me to take the main road?

343
00:19:56,540 --> 00:19:58,300
No problem, you just walk.

344
00:19:58,300 --> 00:19:59,340
However, I tell you,

345
00:20:00,060 --> 00:20:01,540
can't just stop,

346
00:20:01,540 --> 00:20:02,780
can't change lanes,

347
00:20:03,020 --> 00:20:03,700
understand?

348
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:06,300
OK, get in the car.

349
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:14,620
Leave.

350
00:20:15,340 --> 00:20:15,980
Good.

351
00:20:16,220 --> 00:20:16,740
Good.

352
00:20:17,900 --> 00:20:18,420
Good.

353
00:20:35,420 --> 00:20:36,300
Leave.

354
00:20:42,060 --> 00:20:44,060
(Already departed.)

355
00:21:04,420 --> 00:21:05,020
Kapten Xiao,

356
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,300
checked again,

357
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:08,300
nothing suspicious.

358
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:10,860
It's just that there is a cigarette box in the shoe, it feels a little strange.

359
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:23,380
(Wang Guobao; Guo Jing; Piao Yongjin)

360
00:21:25,060 --> 00:21:26,020
Xing Wei,

361
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,740
immediately provide these names to the Customs and Excise Anti-Smuggling Task Force,

362
00:21:28,740 --> 00:21:29,900
see if there is a criminal record.

363
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:30,540
Good.

364
00:21:38,140 --> 00:21:40,260
(Wang Guobao; Guo Jing; Piao Yongjin)

365
00:21:51,140 --> 00:21:51,860
Kapten Xiao,

366
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:53,260
The Customs Anti-Smuggling Task Force has found it.

367
00:21:53,540 --> 00:21:54,620
Enlarge the image.

368
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:57,740
Piao Yongjin.

369
00:21:57,740 --> 00:21:58,740
Often called Jin.

370
00:21:58,740 --> 00:21:59,820
Smuggling recidivist.

371
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,780
In 2000, sentenced to six years in prison

372
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,940
and was released in 2006.

373
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:04,780
Currently suspected by the Customs and Excise Anti-Smuggling Task Force

374
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:06,180
as the person behind the scenes in charge

375
00:22:06,180 --> 00:22:07,140
smuggling several times.

376
00:22:07,260 --> 00:22:09,100
The way it works is similar to Lu Er.

377
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:11,900
He looked for drivers who only wanted money

378
00:22:11,900 --> 00:22:13,340
without knowing anything.

379
00:22:13,820 --> 00:22:15,780
Caught after delivering several goods,

380
00:22:15,780 --> 00:22:17,020
but don't know anything.

381
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,820
Kapten Xiao,

382
00:22:25,060 --> 00:22:25,780
meet.

383
00:22:27,420 --> 00:22:30,540
After they entered ten minutes,

384
00:22:31,420 --> 00:22:33,100
there were no other cars coming in and out anymore.

385
00:22:34,020 --> 00:22:35,460
Check all traffic CCTV,

386
00:22:35,460 --> 00:22:36,500
find this car.

387
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:36,980
Good.

388
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,300
Tongbin,

389
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,260
your decision is correct.

390
00:22:40,740 --> 00:22:42,420
Three cars in Binhai District

391
00:22:42,420 --> 00:22:43,820
keep spinning,

392
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:45,860
not heading towards the port at all.

393
00:23:05,420 --> 00:23:06,300
(Jin One new message)

394
00:23:06,500 --> 00:23:07,780
(Already departed.)

395
00:23:12,780 --> 00:23:13,420
Eight bamboos. [*Mahjong pieces]

396
00:23:19,340 --> 00:23:21,620
The rain was very heavy.

397
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:24,060
The flowers in the garden have just been planted,

398
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,700
don't let my flowers die in the rain.

399
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,900
It's supposed to rain.

400
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:30,940
The heavier the rain, the better.

401
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:32,900
it's you,

402
00:23:32,900 --> 00:23:34,380
can chat, right?

403
00:23:35,140 --> 00:23:35,940
My wife,

404
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:39,020
next time I will give you flowers that won't die when watered,

405
00:23:39,260 --> 00:23:40,580
flowers of pure gold.

406
00:23:51,940 --> 00:23:54,340
Target number one and number two are very stable,

407
00:23:54,340 --> 00:23:55,460
nothing strange.

408
00:23:56,020 --> 00:23:57,020
Those things should be

409
00:23:57,020 --> 00:23:58,220
already taken out before them

410
00:23:58,220 --> 00:23:59,580
left Jialan Electric Appliance Factory.

411
00:24:00,020 --> 00:24:01,620
CCTV at the road junction shows,

412
00:24:01,900 --> 00:24:03,340
the goods car that took them away

413
00:24:03,340 --> 00:24:05,340
disappeared after entering Wuyi Street.

414
00:24:05,340 --> 00:24:07,340
Wuyi Road is being repaired, there is no CCTV.

415
00:24:07,620 --> 00:24:08,940
Twenty minutes later,

416
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,020
the five goods cars left the intersection separately.

417
00:24:11,020 --> 00:24:12,860
Their Piao Yongjin is a total of five people,

418
00:24:13,420 --> 00:24:14,620
There were five goods cars that came out.

419
00:24:15,660 --> 00:24:17,020
They must be delivering goods.

420
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:18,780
We have sent photos of the five people

421
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:22,380
at every SWAT at traffic intersections and border checks.

422
00:24:22,380 --> 00:24:24,660
Once found, it will be followed immediately.

423
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:28,460
What happened?

424
00:24:29,620 --> 00:24:31,420
Captain Xiao, because there is a windstorm,

425
00:24:31,660 --> 00:24:33,900
Telecommunications electricity power was cut off in some places.

426
00:25:27,380 --> 00:25:28,180
Halo.

427
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:28,940
Kak Jin

428
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,860
Wu, why did you stop?

429
00:25:33,580 --> 00:25:35,500
Just ahead there was a wild dog that appeared out of nowhere,

430
00:25:35,500 --> 00:25:36,820
I almost got hit to death.

431
00:25:36,820 --> 00:25:37,660
It's okay, it's okay.

432
00:25:37,660 --> 00:25:38,620
I'll be on my way soon.

433
00:25:47,700 --> 00:25:48,220
report,

434
00:25:48,220 --> 00:25:49,380
Team Three's signal was cut off.

435
00:25:50,100 --> 00:25:51,780
Real time CCTV from border checkpoints is unacceptable.

436
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,900
The traffic command center is preparing repairs.

437
00:25:54,220 --> 00:25:54,620
report,

438
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,820
many urban areas are flooded,

439
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,380
Team five's car couldn't pass.

440
00:25:57,540 --> 00:25:58,500
Reports from traffic,

441
00:25:58,900 --> 00:26:00,700
there was a case of collapse at 16 kilometers of toll road number six,

442
00:26:00,700 --> 00:26:02,340
team eight couldn't get to the designated location.

443
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:21,180
Hello, Bureau Chief Liu.

444
00:26:22,220 --> 00:26:23,620
Is there any news from you?

445
00:26:24,020 --> 00:26:26,980
After providing information on the names of the Jialan Electrical Equipment Factory,

446
00:26:26,980 --> 00:26:27,780
no more news.

447
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:29,060
The cellphone signal has also been cut off.

448
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:31,620
The conditions tonight are complicated.

449
00:26:31,860 --> 00:26:33,380
If it is not possible at the delivery location

450
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,580
catch them all at once,

451
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,660
then just move early,

452
00:26:37,540 --> 00:26:38,700
arrest all those cars.

453
00:26:39,260 --> 00:26:40,340
We have to hold all that stuff.

454
00:26:40,340 --> 00:26:40,660
However...

455
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,700
No more buts.

456
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:45,660
These items must not escape before our eyes.

457
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:52,300
(Public Security Check)

458
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:01,980
Hello, Mr. Police.

459
00:27:01,980 --> 00:27:02,740
Halo,

460
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:03,820
please show me your passport,

461
00:27:03,820 --> 00:27:04,340
driver's license

462
00:27:04,340 --> 00:27:04,980
and bill of lading.

463
00:27:08,820 --> 00:27:10,060
I've prepared it from the start.

464
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:10,460
This.

465
00:27:13,540 --> 00:27:14,740
OK, got it.

466
00:27:15,220 --> 00:27:16,140
How?

467
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:17,620
On Xinken Street,

468
00:27:17,620 --> 00:27:19,060
The Anti-Smuggling Task Force stopped two goods cars.

469
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:21,300
It's being confirmed whether he's a suspect or not.

470
00:27:43,060 --> 00:27:43,500
Save it carefully.

471
00:27:44,460 --> 00:27:45,020
Good.

472
00:27:48,580 --> 00:27:50,660
(Police Check)

473
00:27:56,100 --> 00:27:57,700
Queban has already passed the checkpoint.

474
00:27:58,140 --> 00:27:59,140
OK, accepted.

475
00:27:59,980 --> 00:28:00,660
Kapten Xiao,

476
00:28:00,660 --> 00:28:01,460
Queban has been found.

477
00:28:01,460 --> 00:28:02,460
Watch closely.

478
00:28:02,460 --> 00:28:03,180
Good.

479
00:28:03,580 --> 00:28:04,860
Is there any news from anyone else?

480
00:28:05,300 --> 00:28:06,420
Another checkpoint

481
00:28:06,420 --> 00:28:08,100
Currently we have not found a suspect.

482
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,380
Tell everyone to be careful.

483
00:28:15,620 --> 00:28:17,220
Who drives in weather like this

484
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:19,060
all of them were people who braved the storm and were not afraid of death.

485
00:28:19,220 --> 00:28:21,180
Be careful they break through the checkpoint.

486
00:28:49,220 --> 00:28:50,380
Halo, Kak.

487
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:51,620
Still smooth, right?

488
00:28:52,060 --> 00:28:53,060
No problem.

489
00:28:53,060 --> 00:28:53,940
Good.

490
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:55,420
Be careful driving it.

491
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:56,140
Sis,

492
00:28:56,700 --> 00:28:57,740
why do you say

493
00:28:57,740 --> 00:28:59,260
just like the patrol police said?

494
00:28:59,740 --> 00:29:01,980
Damn kid, drive your car fine.

495
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:02,980
Good.

496
00:29:23,100 --> 00:29:23,940
Hello, Sis Jin,

497
00:29:24,380 --> 00:29:25,460
I'm driving.

498
00:29:27,860 --> 00:29:29,220
No, no, no.

499
00:29:29,540 --> 00:29:31,060
Along this road there was not a single policeman.

500
00:29:33,420 --> 00:29:34,140
Invite people?

501
00:29:34,140 --> 00:29:34,940
Invite who?

502
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:37,260
Follow orders?

503
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:39,340
Wait, wait, where?

504
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,060
Okay.

505
00:29:43,660 --> 00:29:45,700
(Harbor)

506
00:29:47,540 --> 00:29:48,540
(Harbor)

507
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:13,420
The flooding on this road is too severe,

508
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:14,940
my car almost fell over.

509
00:30:20,100 --> 00:30:21,340
OK, I'll try as soon as possible.

510
00:30:21,860 --> 00:30:22,860
Or, will you change the road for me?

511
00:30:26,620 --> 00:30:27,340
Okay.

512
00:30:28,900 --> 00:30:29,540
I understand.

513
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,700
Excuse me, please show me your papers.

514
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,340
Bill of lading.

515
00:30:50,340 --> 00:30:51,140
Bill of lading.

516
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:53,500
This.

517
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,620
Lu, just hurry up.

518
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,100
Behind there are still many cars,

519
00:31:00,620 --> 00:31:01,740
it will also rain later.

520
00:31:03,620 --> 00:31:04,700
Already.

521
00:31:05,620 --> 00:31:06,540
You can walk.

522
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:14,580
Captain,

523
00:31:15,100 --> 00:31:15,740
suitable,

524
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:16,660
there he is.

525
00:31:17,820 --> 00:31:19,100
That's right, it's him.

526
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:20,620
OK, I understand.

527
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:22,780
Kapten Xiao,

528
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:23,620
meet another one.

529
00:31:23,620 --> 00:31:25,100
The driver's name was Wang Guobao.

530
00:31:25,340 --> 00:31:26,180
Good.

531
00:31:26,180 --> 00:31:27,420
Have team five follow.

532
00:31:28,820 --> 00:31:30,220
Have you heard from the other three people?

533
00:31:30,220 --> 00:31:31,420
Until now not yet.

534
00:31:31,580 --> 00:31:33,060
The storm affected communications.

535
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:35,980
Today we lost communication with many checkpoints.

536
00:31:40,060 --> 00:31:41,300
Queban,

537
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:43,380
Guobao.

538
00:31:44,100 --> 00:31:45,620
We have prepared care

539
00:31:45,620 --> 00:31:47,260
on the nine roads leading to the port

540
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:49,180
and some hidden paths

541
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,700
which does not appear on the map.

542
00:31:54,300 --> 00:31:55,260
Harbor.

543
00:31:57,300 --> 00:31:58,740
Harbor.

544
00:31:59,620 --> 00:32:01,060
Apart from the port?

545
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:03,060
The road to the mountain area

546
00:32:03,060 --> 00:32:03,900
there is prepared care, no?

547
00:32:06,460 --> 00:32:07,700
It has been informed to the Anti-Smuggling Task Force,

548
00:32:07,700 --> 00:32:09,180
but they have not completed care there.

549
00:32:09,340 --> 00:32:10,780
Maybe the police force is not enough.

550
00:32:13,140 --> 00:32:13,900
Kapten Xiao,

551
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:15,580
there was no point in them running to the mountains.

552
00:32:15,580 --> 00:32:17,140
There are only steep mountains,

553
00:32:17,140 --> 00:32:18,500
there is no port there either.

554
00:32:24,660 --> 00:32:25,700
Report to Bureau Chief Liu,

555
00:32:26,020 --> 00:32:28,500
Let's see, can you send some police from the police station below?

556
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:30,820
to help patrol the roads leading to mountainous areas.

557
00:32:30,820 --> 00:32:31,500
Good.

558
00:33:02,020 --> 00:33:03,220
Blink four times.

559
00:33:04,260 --> 00:33:05,860
Really unlucky.

560
00:33:08,140 --> 00:33:08,660
Two.

561
00:33:43,180 --> 00:33:43,980
Bos.

562
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:46,020
Wu?

563
00:33:46,700 --> 00:33:47,380
That's right, that's me.

564
00:33:48,740 --> 00:33:49,660
Down.

565
00:33:55,220 --> 00:33:56,740
Jin didn't tell you?

566
00:33:59,140 --> 00:33:59,980
Already.

567
00:34:00,900 --> 00:34:01,900
Listen to all your commands.

568
00:34:03,540 --> 00:34:04,020
Down.

569
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,340
Electric Boss, huh?

570
00:34:22,100 --> 00:34:24,060
So, I'll leave this car to you first.

571
00:34:31,020 --> 00:34:31,980
Work first.

572
00:34:57,020 --> 00:34:58,780
(Electrical Repair)

573
00:35:08,660 --> 00:35:09,260
Naik.

574
00:35:21,860 --> 00:35:22,620
Thank You.

575
00:35:26,660 --> 00:35:27,380
Wear it.

576
00:35:32,700 --> 00:35:33,180
Nope.

577
00:35:34,140 --> 00:35:35,100
Bos,

578
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,780
I'll leave the car to you,

579
00:35:37,460 --> 00:35:38,500
You give me the money,

580
00:35:38,500 --> 00:35:39,500
then my job is done.

581
00:35:39,500 --> 00:35:40,380
Wear it.

582
00:35:45,020 --> 00:35:45,820
Okay.

583
00:36:03,660 --> 00:36:06,260
Whether you've ever accepted a crappy job like this or not,

584
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,700
tiring but doesn't make money.

585
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:08,860
If you knew from the start,

586
00:36:08,860 --> 00:36:10,220
I won't set this price.

587
00:36:27,780 --> 00:36:29,100
Don't look at me like that.

588
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:30,820
Just be honest,

589
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,940
this is the first time in my life,

590
00:36:34,420 --> 00:36:37,780
changing pants while a man is watching.

591
00:36:38,260 --> 00:36:39,620
Just get used to it.

592
00:36:42,940 --> 00:36:43,780
Bos,

593
00:36:44,540 --> 00:36:47,300
I think the two of us are quite a match.

594
00:36:49,860 --> 00:36:50,740
The size is quite right.

595
00:36:53,140 --> 00:36:53,860
Bos,

596
00:36:55,220 --> 00:36:57,660
I've been calling you Electric Boss since it felt rude.

597
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:00,020
This...

598
00:37:00,020 --> 00:37:01,260
would you mind telling me your name?

599
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:02,700
Electric Boss.

600
00:37:04,900 --> 00:37:06,260
OK, OK.

601
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,900
Electric Boss.

602
00:37:09,220 --> 00:37:10,180
I think this trip,

603
00:37:10,180 --> 00:37:11,580
the goods are in my car.

604
00:37:12,260 --> 00:37:14,180
No wonder it feels so heavy when I drive.

605
00:37:14,980 --> 00:37:16,980
That damn genie is pretty trusting of me, huh.

606
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:28,900
We have also matched the clothes.

607
00:37:29,780 --> 00:37:32,220
I think this color enhances the aura,

608
00:37:32,740 --> 00:37:34,540
not everyone is suitable to wear it.

609
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:39,140
Steer the car.

610
00:37:39,140 --> 00:37:40,060
OK, Chairman.

611
00:37:48,260 --> 00:37:49,580
In which direction, Chairman?

612
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:51,420
The intersection ahead,

613
00:37:51,860 --> 00:37:52,660
enter the main road.

614
00:37:53,820 --> 00:37:54,580
Big road?

615
00:37:55,540 --> 00:37:57,180
There are border checks on major roads.

616
00:38:13,340 --> 00:38:14,340
That's right too.

617
00:38:14,940 --> 00:38:16,500
We have duties, yes.

618
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:19,420
Electric Boss, this tactic of yours...

619
00:38:20,780 --> 00:38:21,940
can also

621
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:09,100
Halo.

622
00:39:11,660 --> 00:39:13,460
Don't you know why I stopped?

623
00:39:13,580 --> 00:39:15,020
In front of me is the checkpoint.

624
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:20,020
I have a criminal record and have been flagged to the police.

625
00:39:20,740 --> 00:39:21,340
Jin,

626
00:39:21,700 --> 00:39:22,660
looking at our relationship,

627
00:39:22,660 --> 00:39:24,780
can you tell me the truth,

628
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:27,020
Is there something in my car or not?

629
00:39:28,340 --> 00:39:28,860
Halo.

630
00:39:30,380 --> 00:39:30,900
Halo.

631
00:40:39,540 --> 00:40:40,140

634
00:40:47,700 --> 00:40:50,380
Jin and Wu have not been found.

635
00:41:12,500 --> 00:41:13,580
There is a police, Sis.

636
00:41:14,220 --> 00:41:15,020
How about this?

637
00:41:17,580 --> 00:41:18,460
Don't stop.

638
00:41:19,140 --> 00:41:19,660
Keep going.

639
00:41:25,260 --> 00:41:25,940
That is true,

640
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:29,380
we have duties, yes.

641
00:41:36,780 --> 00:41:37,580
Bos,

642
00:41:38,580 --> 00:41:40,180
Your gun won't misfire, right?

643
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:42,420
My shooting skills are not good.

644
00:41:42,420 --> 00:41:43,860
Your gun is better...

645
00:41:43,860 --> 00:41:44,820
Look at the road, look at the road.

646
00:41:45,420 --> 00:41:46,540
...don't shoot me.

647
00:41:58,140 --> 00:41:59,500
High voltage cable problem up front, huh?

648
00:42:00,300 --> 00:42:01,540
The road entering Heishi Village was hit by floods,

649
00:42:01,540 --> 00:42:02,620
we went to check it out.

650
00:42:17,380 --> 00:42:18,180
Well, go ahead.
