00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,940
=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 15=

3
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,880
Miss Lecturer Ke.

4
00:02:18,470 --> 00:02:20,000
Even though you only work part time,

5
00:02:20,510 --> 00:02:22,040
please show your dedication.

6
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:43,710
Sis, he is...

7
00:03:43,710 --> 00:03:44,480
Gang.

8
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,360
Gang.

9
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:46,560
It's very safe here.

10
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,000
There were many girls in the room.

11
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Please choose as you like.

12
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:53,040
Take off your sunglasses.

13
00:04:04,710 --> 00:04:05,710
You two, go ahead.

14
00:04:14,710 --> 00:04:16,520
Where did you find this stiff woman?

15
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,040
Young Master Chi is very loyal, huh.

16
00:04:19,520 --> 00:04:21,360
Every day having fun and fooling around with women.

17
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:24,920
Your words don't make sense.

18
00:04:25,550 --> 00:04:27,240
With great difficulty I finally went home.

19
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:29,920
Eat, drink, play, be happy.

20
00:04:30,550 --> 00:04:33,200
You're happy, I'm happy.

21
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:37,360
You see how difficult it is for me.

22
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:39,040
Just been home two days,

23
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:40,870
Uncle has kicked him out again.

24
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:43,310
So soon do you want to go again?

25
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:45,760
Yes, go.

26
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:47,240
I'm leaving in two days.

27
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:49,830
Who said you are a person who likes to learn?

28
00:04:49,960 --> 00:04:50,990
There are several things

29
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,520
I still have to do it.

30
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,040
Moreover,

31
00:04:55,310 --> 00:04:56,360
if i go,

32
00:04:56,920 --> 00:04:58,390
Can't your heart just feel calm?

33
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:11,150
I realised,

34
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,040
This time you come home, your changes are very big.

35
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:16,360
You didn't drink any wine before.

36
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,150
Why is it like now

37
00:05:18,150 --> 00:05:19,520
change into a different person?

38
00:05:28,040 --> 00:05:29,870
Everyone must give of themselves

39
00:05:29,870 --> 00:05:31,550
one chance to change his life.

40
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:35,390
This speech

41
00:05:36,040 --> 00:05:37,870
just like what my sister said.

42
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:38,680
Ayo.

43
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:40,550
Cheers.

44
00:05:53,550 --> 00:05:54,430
Criticism?

45
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,310
If you like, we can exchange.

46
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:06,710
I've seen it.

47
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:08,550
Pretend I never said that sentence.

48
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:09,990
Ya Ya.

49
00:06:22,310 --> 00:06:23,520
Look at others,

50
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:24,870
very dignified.

51
00:06:25,550 --> 00:06:27,240
When you meet other people, say hello first.

52
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:29,550
Mr. Feng.

53
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:30,990
Mr. Feng what?

54
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:32,040
Call sister.

55
00:06:32,550 --> 00:06:33,310
Sister.

56
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:40,680
You came late.

57
00:06:41,110 --> 00:06:41,990
Say what has to be said.

58
00:06:44,830 --> 00:06:46,360
Mr. Feng, Miss Ke.

59
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:48,110
The problem that day...

60
00:06:48,110 --> 00:06:48,920
I apologize.

61
00:06:50,760 --> 00:06:52,680
Just like that, I punished myself by drinking a glass.

62
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:54,270
Miss Ke, accompany me to drink a glass.

63
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:56,040
Miss Ke, have a glass with him.

64
00:06:56,960 --> 00:06:58,150
Then, I also drink a glass.

65
00:06:58,960 --> 00:06:59,870
Giving face.

66
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:27,990
Sister.

67
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:29,150
I toast you.

68
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:32,390
I also drank a glass.

69
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:37,200
Pak Li.

70
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:39,110
Then you have to drink a glass, congratulations, congratulations.

71
00:07:39,110 --> 00:07:40,270
Safe, safe.

72
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:04,830
I'm leaving in two days.

73
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:07,150
Who said you are a person who likes to learn?

74
00:08:07,480 --> 00:08:08,360
There are several things

75
00:08:08,590 --> 00:08:10,040
I still have to do it.

76
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:30,960
Halo.

77
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,040
Give this to Feng Ruichi.

78
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:36,830
Tell him to look for me on the terrace.

79
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:43,120
At the next party you can still drink.

80
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:48,880
Mr. Feng.

81
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:56,800
There was a friend there.

82
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:57,950
I went to see him for a while.

83
00:09:26,270 --> 00:09:28,480
Your nature is really changeable, yes.

84
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,190
I am your sister's girlfriend.

85
00:09:35,950 --> 00:09:38,950
Then let's just say we're friends.

86
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,830
If your sister finds out,

87
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,830
he will kill me

88
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:47,120
My brother doesn't even dare to kill a chicken.

89
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:49,070
Are you kidding me?

90
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:52,040
What we talked about

91
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:53,190
doesn't seem like the same person.

92
00:09:54,510 --> 00:09:55,950
Feng Xiaosheng yang kukenal,

93
00:09:56,920 --> 00:09:58,800
he doesn't blink when killing humans.

94
00:10:00,950 --> 00:10:02,710
Then, have you ever seen my brother kill someone?

95
00:10:05,190 --> 00:10:06,510
If I tell you,

96
00:10:06,510 --> 00:10:08,000
he killed himself,

97
00:10:08,390 --> 00:10:09,240
do you believe it?

98
00:10:11,150 --> 00:10:13,320
Who is now standing in front of you,

99
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,070
not the real Feng Xiaosheng.

100
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:21,800
Bu Ke.

101
00:10:22,590 --> 00:10:24,480
Are you giving me a philosophy lesson?

102
00:10:27,070 --> 00:10:28,880
If you use your imagination,

103
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:29,880
then you should think about it,

104
00:10:30,390 --> 00:10:31,710
heir of the Feng family,

105
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:33,240
from the start it should have been you.

106
00:10:34,830 --> 00:10:35,680
I remind you,

107
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:37,240
my brother now

108
00:10:37,240 --> 00:10:38,440
sit inside.

109
00:10:43,390 --> 00:10:45,000
Do you know Shen Shijie?

110
00:10:48,270 --> 00:10:48,920
Who?

111
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:51,440
Feng Ruichi!

112
00:10:51,590 --> 00:10:52,630
Are you in there?

113
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:58,040
Mengenai kisah Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie,

114
00:10:58,320 --> 00:10:59,560
if you are interested,

115
00:10:59,830 --> 00:11:00,880
you can find me here.

116
00:11:01,240 --> 00:11:02,150
I was there a few days ago.

117
00:11:07,070 --> 00:11:09,240
Your joke seems a bit excessive.

118
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:10,320
Joke or not,

119
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:11,120
when you come looking for me,

120
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:12,000
I'll tell you.

121
00:11:58,270 --> 00:11:58,880
Let's go.

122
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:40,560
Mr. Feng, what are you looking for?

123
00:12:40,630 --> 00:12:41,750
How about I help you find it?

124
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:43,560
It's okay, I've found it.

125
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:45,630
Good.

126
00:12:54,680 --> 00:12:55,950
Miss Ke's shirt buttons.

127
00:12:58,150 --> 00:13:00,360
Do I need to go deliver it later?

128
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:01,440
No need.

129
00:13:01,710 --> 00:13:02,880
Next time when I meet him,

130
00:13:02,950 --> 00:13:03,510
I just gave it.

131
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,560
Good.

132
00:13:06,510 --> 00:13:07,480
Be careful, Mr. Feng.

133
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:09,630
Wu.

134
00:13:12,120 --> 00:13:12,880
Go up for a while.

135
00:13:13,680 --> 00:13:14,630
Take things.

136
00:13:15,630 --> 00:13:16,150
Good.

137
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:33,480
Mr. Feng.

138
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:34,630
What did you tell me to take?

139
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:38,000
Hold him.

140
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:40,630
Nope.

141
00:13:41,390 --> 00:13:42,070
Mr. Feng.

142
00:13:42,920 --> 00:13:43,590
You are...

143
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,000
Who sent you here?

144
00:13:47,480 --> 00:13:48,070
What?

145
00:13:48,070 --> 00:13:48,630
Send?

146
00:13:49,240 --> 00:13:50,360
No, what do you mean?

147
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:52,480
Big Boss?

148
00:13:54,710 --> 00:13:55,390
Second uncle?

149
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:00,390
You can't be a spy, right?

150
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,480
Nope.

151
00:14:02,830 --> 00:14:04,710
What is this?

152
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:06,360
What was sent?

153
00:14:06,390 --> 00:14:07,630
You asked me yourself

154
00:14:07,630 --> 00:14:08,590
be your driver, right?

155
00:14:09,560 --> 00:14:10,560
Pretty stubborn.

156
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:11,560
No, this is...

157
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:13,750
If there is a problem, just say it straight away, don't use this method.

158
00:14:13,750 --> 00:14:15,270
I also have limits to my patience.

159
00:14:15,270 --> 00:14:16,150
I'm your driver.

160
00:14:16,150 --> 00:14:17,190
I'm not selling myself to you.

161
00:14:17,360 --> 00:14:18,630
I don't need to accept your anger.

162
00:14:18,630 --> 00:14:19,880
At most I don't work anymore.

163
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:22,880
Temperamental.

164
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:24,950
No, Mr. Feng.

165
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:26,510
Explain what really happened.

166
00:14:26,510 --> 00:14:27,320
I do not understand...

167
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:34,270
If you continue your nonsense...

168
00:14:43,560 --> 00:14:44,710
I will kill you.

169
00:14:48,750 --> 00:14:50,630
No matter how many times you ask, my answer is the same.

170
00:14:53,880 --> 00:14:55,070
If you suspect me,

171
00:14:56,120 --> 00:14:57,480
shoot me now.

172
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:01,950
However, tell me before you shoot,

173
00:15:01,950 --> 00:15:03,480
What exactly did I do wrong?

174
00:15:04,830 --> 00:15:06,360
What's the point of doing something like this?

175
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:08,510
Ayo.

176
00:15:11,320 --> 00:15:11,950
Ayo.

177
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:31,920
Mr. Feng, what are you looking for?

178
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,120
How about I help you find it?

179
00:15:33,190 --> 00:15:34,560
It's okay, I've found it.

180
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,630
This is the thing you found in the car.

181
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:39,120
This is...

182
00:15:39,190 --> 00:15:40,360
Eavesdropping device.

183
00:15:47,710 --> 00:15:48,590
Continue your acting.

184
00:15:49,510 --> 00:15:50,630
What's the acting?

185
00:15:50,630 --> 00:15:52,270
You don't need to scare me with this.

186
00:15:58,510 --> 00:15:59,880
Master Feng, you think carefully.

187
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:02,270
Calm down a bit.

188
00:16:05,270 --> 00:16:06,880
Where did you find this?

189
00:16:10,710 --> 00:16:11,830
You found it

190
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:14,150
under the driver's seat,

191
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:16,710
when looking for buttons.

192
00:16:20,750 --> 00:16:21,270
He put it there

193
00:16:21,270 --> 00:16:23,040
definitely because he wanted to listen to the people in the back seat.

194
00:16:23,630 --> 00:16:24,270
Right, right?

195
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:26,630
Who sits in the back seat?

196
00:16:27,630 --> 00:16:28,920
You sit in the back seat.

197
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:30,750
When you sit in the back seat,

198
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:31,800
what am I doing?

199
00:16:32,750 --> 00:16:34,240
I'm driving the car.

200
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,040
Mr. Feng.

201
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:41,240
Nope.

202
00:16:42,630 --> 00:16:44,040
You still don't understand?

203
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:52,560
You finally understand, right?

204
00:16:53,360 --> 00:16:54,750
Isn't that the logic?

205
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:57,630
I drive in the front seat.

206
00:16:57,880 --> 00:16:59,480
Whatever you talk about in the back seat,

207
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:00,150
who are you calling?

208
00:17:00,150 --> 00:17:01,150
I can hear clearly.

209
00:17:01,150 --> 00:17:02,000
I'm not deaf either.

210
00:17:02,750 --> 00:17:03,590
Do I need...

211
00:17:04,270 --> 00:17:05,270
using a tapping device

212
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:05,990
as my ears?

213
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,110
No need, really, right?

214
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:09,390
Why are you suspecting me?

215
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:11,990
You better suspect Gang.

216
00:17:12,230 --> 00:17:12,800
I...

217
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:14,270
I didn't install it.

218
00:17:14,630 --> 00:17:15,960
What's not you, don't talk nonsense.

219
00:17:18,870 --> 00:17:19,630
Let him go.

220
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:40,110
From the start he was a walking eavesdropper.

221
00:17:45,960 --> 00:17:47,150
I'm hungry, buy me some food.

222
00:18:23,470 --> 00:18:24,110
Ayah.

223
00:18:25,390 --> 00:18:26,320
It's so late.

224
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,470
Why call me home in such a hurry?

225
00:18:33,470 --> 00:18:34,750
Are you going to the office today?

226
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,560
Going to the office?

227
00:18:36,800 --> 00:18:38,110
Why do I go to the office?

228
00:18:39,320 --> 00:18:40,870
Then, why did I call you home?

229
00:18:41,630 --> 00:18:43,470
Dad, you start again.

230
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,750
I'll say it one more time.

231
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:46,960
No matter it's uncle or Sheng,

232
00:18:47,040 --> 00:18:48,600
the two of them will not target

233
00:18:48,600 --> 00:18:49,440
your little money.

234
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,110
OK, OK.

235
00:18:51,110 --> 00:18:52,200
They're not after my money.

236
00:18:52,200 --> 00:18:53,920
So, will my money grow wings and fly on its own?

237
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:00,920
Oh yes.

238
00:19:02,040 --> 00:19:03,350
Did you meet Sheng today?

239
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:06,750
We even drank together.

240
00:19:07,320 --> 00:19:08,200
Drink?

241
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:11,600
Doesn't he never drink?

242
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:14,200
I didn't drink before.

243
00:19:14,350 --> 00:19:15,320
Right now,

244
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,080
drank everything he didn't drink before.

245
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:18,200
Moreover,

246
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:19,870
I came back all the way from abroad.

247
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:20,960
He accompanies me to drink,

248
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:22,600
is there anything strange?

249
00:19:25,350 --> 00:19:26,960
So, what today...

250
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:29,270
you see

251
00:19:29,270 --> 00:19:30,840
is there something wrong with him?

252
00:19:36,040 --> 00:19:37,960
Come to think of it...

253
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:40,080
If I tell you,

254
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:41,470
he killed himself,

255
00:19:41,920 --> 00:19:42,840
do you believe it?

256
00:19:45,390 --> 00:19:47,630
Who is now standing in front of you,

257
00:19:47,720 --> 00:19:49,270
not the real Feng Xiaosheng.

258
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:52,470
There really are quite a few.

259
00:19:52,920 --> 00:19:54,470
Feels like...

260
00:19:55,720 --> 00:19:56,960
change into someone else.

261
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,680
Have you found out?

262
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:08,960
Found out what?

263
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:17,230
today,

264
00:20:17,230 --> 00:20:18,470
I'm listening to this eavesdropping device.

265
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,150
This afternoon it was still connected,

266
00:20:20,470 --> 00:20:21,990
At night I couldn't connect anymore.

267
00:20:22,630 --> 00:20:23,390
Customer service says,

268
00:20:23,390 --> 00:20:24,470
this kind of situation

269
00:20:24,470 --> 00:20:25,600
only possible because of the other party

270
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,320
turn off this eavesdropping device.

271
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,470
You installed a listening device on Sheng?

272
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,350
Installed in his car.

273
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:34,600
Customer service already said,

274
00:20:34,600 --> 00:20:36,600
definitely won't get caught.

275
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:37,680
Ayah.

276
00:20:38,110 --> 00:20:39,470
My biological father.

277
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,040
What time is it now?

278
00:20:41,350 --> 00:20:43,110
Why do you always do stupid things like this?

279
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:44,750
What's ridiculous?

280
00:20:45,390 --> 00:20:46,840
He can do dirty tricks behind,

281
00:20:46,840 --> 00:20:47,680
but i can't play

282
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:48,560
some tricks on him?

283
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:52,780
(Sister)

284
00:20:56,800 --> 00:20:57,470
Sister?

285
00:21:00,600 --> 00:21:02,350
It's so late, why did he call me?

286
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,600
There are words that you definitely don't like to hear,

287
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,040
but I still have to say it.

288
00:21:21,230 --> 00:21:22,440
Have you ever thought,

289
00:21:23,270 --> 00:21:24,200
why your second uncle

290
00:21:25,870 --> 00:21:27,630
install things like this

291
00:21:30,510 --> 00:21:31,510
in your car?

292
00:21:33,040 --> 00:21:34,110
What are you doing

293
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,560
to force him to do this?

294
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,440
He is my second uncle.

295
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:43,390
What can I force him to do?

296
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,630
I feel like he installed this thing,

297
00:21:48,920 --> 00:21:50,230
with you sending people to watch me,

298
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:51,990
the meaning is more or less the same.

299
00:21:56,040 --> 00:21:57,560
I sent people after you,

300
00:21:58,150 --> 00:21:59,440
because I'm afraid you won't get used to it

301
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:00,560
with this new identity.

302
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:03,510
Once you make a mistake,

303
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:07,680
then there are people who can help you on time.

304
00:22:08,680 --> 00:22:09,920
If you mind,

305
00:22:11,720 --> 00:22:12,870
I'll draw

306
00:22:13,630 --> 00:22:15,080
Alley is back.

307
00:22:16,150 --> 00:22:17,840
No need to pull, just keep an eye on it.

308
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:19,200
If you are calm,

309
00:22:19,560 --> 00:22:20,920
My heart also feels calm.

310
00:22:25,230 --> 00:22:27,040
Your hatred for me,

311
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:29,960
towards the Feng family,

312
00:22:32,440 --> 00:22:34,600
when will it end?

313
00:22:40,630 --> 00:22:41,470
Big Boss.

314
00:22:42,870 --> 00:22:44,470
I really have no hatred.

315
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:47,470
Speak fairly.

316
00:22:49,470 --> 00:22:50,560
Who forced whom?

317
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,350
How about we

318
00:23:03,680 --> 00:23:04,870
just come in later?

319
00:23:05,630 --> 00:23:07,630
Wait for your uncle's anger to subside a little.

320
00:23:08,080 --> 00:23:09,200
We've arrived here.

321
00:23:09,470 --> 00:23:10,230
Come on in.

322
00:23:11,350 --> 00:23:13,470
You don't know your uncle's temper.

323
00:23:17,110 --> 00:23:17,840
Come on in.

324
00:23:22,920 --> 00:23:23,750
Enter.

325
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:50,320
Sister.

326
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:54,320
I am wrong.

327
00:23:57,080 --> 00:23:58,390
Look what you're doing?

328
00:23:58,390 --> 00:23:58,990
Sister.

329
00:23:59,350 --> 00:23:59,960
Uncle.

330
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:01,390
Uncle, Uncle.

331
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,990
Brother, I admit I was wrong, okay?

332
00:24:02,990 --> 00:24:03,630
Talk about it carefully, Uncle.

333
00:24:03,630 --> 00:24:04,510
It's great, isn't it?

334
00:24:04,510 --> 00:24:05,470
- Calm your anger, Uncle. - You, you...

335
00:24:05,470 --> 00:24:06,440
- Uncle. - This kind of lowly trick...

336
00:24:06,440 --> 00:24:06,680
Calm your anger.

337
00:24:06,680 --> 00:24:08,150
...used on one's own family!

338
00:24:08,150 --> 00:24:09,110
No, no. You, you...

339
00:24:09,510 --> 00:24:09,750
I...

340
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:10,750
Uncle, Uncle.

341
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:11,270
- Today I... - Uncle.

342
00:24:11,870 --> 00:24:13,200
- Can you talk about it carefully? - Relieve your anger.

343
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:14,750
Dad, Dad, Dad.

344
00:24:14,990 --> 00:24:16,600
- Never mind, never mind. - No, are you endless?

345
00:24:17,800 --> 00:24:18,840
Give it to him.

346
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:19,510
Let him beat me to death.

347
00:24:19,510 --> 00:24:20,200
If you dare, beat me to death!

348
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:22,840
What's lowly?

349
00:24:23,390 --> 00:24:24,560
Actually, who is lowly?

350
00:24:25,270 --> 00:24:28,080
Up front, you said brothers respect each other,

351
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,600
one heart and help each other.

352
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:31,560
Behind,

353
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:32,600
you just stabbed me, didn't you?

354
00:24:32,600 --> 00:24:33,470
Stealing other people's money.

355
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,840
Your son becomes chairman of the board of directors.

356
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:38,080
Standing high, acting like a big person.

357
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,440
Then, my son?

358
00:24:39,840 --> 00:24:40,960
Today to Malta,

359
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:41,960
tomorrow to Marbury.

360
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:42,750
Running back and forth,

361
00:24:42,750 --> 00:24:43,720
tired somehow.

362
00:24:43,800 --> 00:24:44,750
Didn't even have time to care about family.

363
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:45,320
You still...

364
00:24:45,800 --> 00:24:47,320
Still what? On what basis?

365
00:24:48,440 --> 00:24:49,920
OK, I'm not educated.

366
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:50,510
Right, right?

367
00:24:50,510 --> 00:24:51,750
I can only fight and kill.

368
00:24:51,750 --> 00:24:52,680
I'm really embarrassed.

369
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:54,680
However, my son is also a university graduate.

370
00:24:54,680 --> 00:24:55,920
On what basis should I listen to you guys?

371
00:24:56,080 --> 00:24:58,320
Dad, dad, don't be like this.

372
00:24:58,600 --> 00:24:59,510
Diam!

373
00:25:01,680 --> 00:25:02,750
Throwing the bones out,

374
00:25:02,750 --> 00:25:03,800
we have to be like dogs,

375
00:25:03,800 --> 00:25:05,040
ran and brought it back,

376
00:25:05,040 --> 00:25:05,510
yes, right?

377
00:25:06,040 --> 00:25:07,320
Lived us like dogs,

378
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:08,080
give that little money,

379
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,080
looking down on us, huh?

380
00:25:13,560 --> 00:25:14,440
Every time,

381
00:25:15,320 --> 00:25:16,990
problems such as fighting, hitting people,

382
00:25:16,990 --> 00:25:18,270
and kill people,

383
00:25:18,510 --> 00:25:19,600
did you guys go do it?

384
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:21,320
Isn't it still me who does it?

385
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:25,080
Do you remember this?

386
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:26,560
You take a look. You take a look.

387
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:27,510
Do you remember this?

388
00:25:27,750 --> 00:25:28,750
What knife scar is this?

389
00:25:29,150 --> 00:25:30,470
I blocked the knife for you!

390
00:25:32,390 --> 00:25:34,560
Dozens of wounds on my body, both big and small,

391
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:37,230
it was all for the sake of the Feng family!

392
00:25:38,230 --> 00:25:39,750
When we fought bravely at the front,

393
00:25:39,750 --> 00:25:40,510
where are you?

394
00:25:40,600 --> 00:25:41,960
I'm the one who always blocks the knife.

395
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:43,270
Without me and my child

396
00:25:44,040 --> 00:25:45,750
who does those dirty things in front,

397
00:25:46,680 --> 00:25:48,040
can you live like now?

398
00:25:51,230 --> 00:25:52,440
You guys are the opposite,

399
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:54,390
make tens of billions of money,

400
00:25:54,390 --> 00:25:55,320
but you're still not satisfied.

401
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:56,750
Still taking my little money.

402
00:25:56,840 --> 00:25:58,600
That's the money I earned by risking my life!

403
00:25:59,320 --> 00:26:00,600
Are you my brother?

404
00:26:01,750 --> 00:26:02,840
You bastard!

405
00:26:03,080 --> 00:26:04,080
Are you finished?

406
00:26:05,390 --> 00:26:06,440
Uncle, Uncle.

407
00:26:06,440 --> 00:26:07,720
Reduce your anger, reduce your anger.

408
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,080
Reduce your anger, reduce your anger.

409
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:12,960
Calm your anger, Uncle.

410
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:30,600
Uncle.

411
00:26:30,750 --> 00:26:31,600
Uncle, you sit down first.

412
00:26:32,150 --> 00:26:32,840
You sit.

413
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:34,320
Calm your anger.

414
00:26:35,390 --> 00:26:36,720
My father was a rough man.

415
00:26:37,230 --> 00:26:38,200
You know him best.

416
00:26:38,390 --> 00:26:39,680
Do not put in the heart.

417
00:26:40,920 --> 00:26:41,440
Sister.

418
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:42,720
Sister.

419
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,600
Say something.

420
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:48,800
Ruichi.

421
00:26:49,990 --> 00:26:52,230
You and Sheng go back first.

422
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:56,680
I have something to say to your father.

423
00:26:57,600 --> 00:26:58,200
Ayah.

424
00:26:58,750 --> 00:27:01,200
Don't be angry, talk about it carefully.

425
00:27:02,680 --> 00:27:03,440
I go first.

426
00:27:14,560 --> 00:27:15,230
Sister.

427
00:27:19,150 --> 00:27:20,270
Do you know Shen Shijie?

428
00:27:25,230 --> 00:27:25,990
Do not know her.

429
00:27:26,270 --> 00:27:26,920
Why?

430
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:31,960
Your changes are truly enormous.

431
00:27:34,960 --> 00:27:35,600
Is it true?

432
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:37,560
Maybe because you haven't seen me for a long time.

433
00:27:38,470 --> 00:27:39,440
If you have time, let's eat together.

434
00:27:44,990 --> 00:27:46,560
Invite Little Sister Ke Ying too.

435
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:50,960
Good.

436
00:28:04,270 --> 00:28:04,840
Sister.

437
00:28:18,560 --> 00:28:19,600
You don't need to go with me.

438
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,840
It's been quite tiring lately.

439
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:24,440
I'll give you a few days off.

440
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:25,680
Rest well.

441
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:28,800
No, Mr. Feng, I...

442
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:32,820
(Big Boss)

443
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:35,320
Halo.

444
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:42,800
Good.

445
00:28:45,920 --> 00:28:46,680
Wait for me.

446
00:29:04,620 --> 00:29:07,000
(Feng Xiaosheng)

447
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:22,580
(Feng Xiaosheng; Shen Shijie)

448
00:29:40,600 --> 00:29:41,750
Ke Ying came looking for me.

449
00:29:42,040 --> 00:29:43,440
Katanya, Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie

450
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:44,350
are the same person.

451
00:29:44,440 --> 00:29:45,840
This thinking is very strange.

452
00:29:46,750 --> 00:29:47,990
However, he was very afraid

453
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:49,470
and also very serious.

454
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:51,990
In front of me, he even

455
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:54,080
followed Feng Xiaosheng from behind

456
00:29:54,080 --> 00:29:55,440
and called him by the name of Shen Shijie.

457
00:29:56,840 --> 00:29:58,510
Feng Xiaosheng did not respond at all.

458
00:30:00,510 --> 00:30:02,470
However, in the next video,

459
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:03,560
I realized that

460
00:30:03,720 --> 00:30:05,320
when Feng Xiaosheng heard

461
00:30:05,320 --> 00:30:06,870
nama Shen Shijie,

462
00:30:07,270 --> 00:30:07,990
his hand

463
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:09,510
unconsciously

464
00:30:09,510 --> 00:30:10,960
responded by clenching his fists.

465
00:30:11,800 --> 00:30:12,680
This proves

466
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:14,750
Feng Xiaosheng

467
00:30:15,920 --> 00:30:16,750
dan Shen Shijie,

468
00:30:16,750 --> 00:30:18,960
very likely there is a relationship.

469
00:30:22,080 --> 00:30:23,440
This morning,

470
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:25,390
I went to Feng Xiaosheng's office.

471
00:30:26,350 --> 00:30:27,720
I mentioned Shen Shijie's name to him.

472
00:30:28,840 --> 00:30:30,200
He said he didn't know.

473
00:30:32,320 --> 00:30:33,600
He's lying.

474
00:30:36,680 --> 00:30:39,150
Bentuk tubuh Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie

475
00:30:40,510 --> 00:30:41,320
very similar.

476
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:42,750
In addition, their level

477
00:30:42,750 --> 00:30:44,320
also have similarities.

478
00:30:45,990 --> 00:30:46,840
Ke Ying,

479
00:30:46,840 --> 00:30:49,510
as a victim in the Shen Shijie case,

480
00:30:50,840 --> 00:30:52,270
is it possible that he misrecognizes people?

481
00:30:53,840 --> 00:30:55,230
On the other hand,

482
00:30:55,750 --> 00:30:57,870
the victim has special cognition

483
00:30:58,270 --> 00:30:59,750
towards the person who hurt him.

484
00:31:00,750 --> 00:31:02,390
There must be a reason

485
00:31:03,230 --> 00:31:04,560
for his fear.

486
00:31:05,990 --> 00:31:06,680
Must be investigated.

487
00:31:43,870 --> 00:31:44,470
How?

488
00:31:45,040 --> 00:31:46,270
Did you manage to make an appointment with Ke Ying?

489
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:47,560
No.

490
00:31:47,800 --> 00:31:48,680
I've gone to campus.

491
00:31:48,750 --> 00:31:50,560
The teacher said he brought the student

492
00:31:50,560 --> 00:31:51,920
go to the convention center in the suburbs,

493
00:31:52,080 --> 00:31:53,200
volunteer at the event.

494
00:32:07,990 --> 00:32:08,870
Everything has arrived, right?

495
00:32:10,110 --> 00:32:10,750
Wait for me.

496
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:14,390
Wait for me here.

497
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,320
Good.

498

(Nanzhou 2018 7th Nanzhou International Economic Forum)

499
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:35,870
Take them on board immediately when they arrive.

500
00:32:36,080 --> 00:32:36,680
Good.

501
00:32:37,080 --> 00:32:37,960
Is everything ready?

502
00:32:37,960 --> 00:32:38,630
Ready.

503
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:02,560
(7th Nanzhou International Economic Forum)

504
00:33:02,560 --> 00:33:04,560
The forum will start soon.

505
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,750
Leaders and guests participating in these two days,

506
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:10,440
all will come one after another.

have to pay attention

509
00:33:14,720 --> 00:33:18,390
attitudes, manners, words and actions of each.

510
00:33:19,680 --> 00:33:20,680
Who you represent

511
00:33:21,230 --> 00:33:22,720
not just you personally,

512
00:33:23,630 --> 00:33:24,750
but also your department,

513
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:26,870

514
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,630
even the image of the entire Nanzhou.

515
00:33:30,630 --> 00:33:31,350
Bu Ke.

516
00:33:31,720 --> 00:33:32,470
Here...

517
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:34,390
Master Feng Ruichi asked me to give it to you.

518
00:33:35,150 --> 00:33:35,870
First.

519
00:33:35,870 --> 00:33:36,920
Feng Ruichi?

520
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:37,720
Of.

521
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:40,230
Trouble coming late and leaving early,

522
00:33:40,750 --> 00:33:42,040
strictly prohibited.

523
00:33:42,470 --> 00:33:44,510
This kind of thing cannot happen.

524
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:46,150
Second.

525
00:33:46,470 --> 00:33:48,270
Must pay attention to environmental cleanliness.

526
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:50,560
In all areas,

527
00:33:50,990 --> 00:33:51,960
not allowed to exist

528
00:33:52,040 --> 00:33:53,470
all kinds of rubbish.

you can find me here.

532
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:04,390
I was there a few days ago.

533
00:34:06,680 --> 00:34:08,990
This is not very good for the image of our Nanzhou.

534
00:34:11,710 --> 00:34:12,510
Third.

535
00:34:13,670 --> 00:34:17,400
Must pay attention to personal clothing.

540

Quite tiring.

541

I really miss you.

542
00:34:44,160 --> 00:34:45,120
Do you miss me?

543

Hello, Miss Lecturer Ke.

561
00:38:29,840 --> 00:38:31,510
Young Master Chi is not feeling well today.

562
00:38:31,990 --> 00:38:32,710
He asked me

563
00:38:33,600 --> 00:38:34,800
return this to you.

564
00:38:37,430 --> 00:38:38,640

to him.

567
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:48,640
Actually

568
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,190
what do you know about

569
00:38:50,190 --> 00:38:51,510

570
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:53,880
Tell me quickly.

571

I'm also very curious.

572
00:38:58,670 --> 00:39:00,190
Do you know Shen Shijie?

573
00:39:02,600 --> 00:39:03,190
Who?

574
00:39:06,270 --> 00:39:07,320
I don't know anything.

575
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,600
I just wanted to deceive Feng Ruichi.

576
00:39:11,040 --> 00:39:11,670
I feel it too

577
00:39:11,670 --> 00:39:13,230
you just want to trick him.

578
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,670
Ruichi bilang,

579
00:39:23,120 --> 00:39:24,600
Mrs. Ke here

580
00:39:26,640 --> 00:39:28,600
secretly invited him to meet.

581
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:31,750
Want to tell him

582
00:39:32,950 --> 00:39:34,080
about interesting relationships

583
00:39:35,320 --> 00:39:37,710
between you and Shen Shijie.

584
00:39:57,880 --> 00:39:59,160
If you fall from this height,

585
00:39:59,670 --> 00:40:00,710
it should be very stressful, right?

586
00:40:03,950 --> 00:40:05,360
Before coming I had told my colleague

587
00:40:05,360 --> 00:40:06,430
I went to see Mr. Feng.

588
00:40:06,950 --> 00:40:07,880
If I die,

589
00:40:08,950 --> 00:40:10,040
you will be investigated.

590
00:40:15,510 --> 00:40:17,230
Look what you did.

591
00:40:18,840 --> 00:40:19,670
It was finally time

592
00:40:19,670 --> 00:40:20,750
I sympathize and let you go.

593
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,190
You're not just ungrateful,

594
00:40:22,910 --> 00:40:24,230
instead went to provoke Feng Ruichi.

595
00:40:25,560 --> 00:40:26,750
He is my sister.

596
00:40:27,160 --> 00:40:27,800
Ke Ying.

597
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:29,750
What is your brain really thinking?

598
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:37,800
Before I enter this building,

599
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,190
I talked to Yang Yuze on the phone.

600
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,080
If I'm not out in 30 minutes,

601
00:40:41,360 --> 00:40:42,320
he will immediately report to the police.

602
00:40:48,430 --> 00:40:49,840
You can see the call history.

603
00:40:50,840 --> 00:40:52,320
He has called me many times.

604
00:40:52,880 --> 00:40:54,120
He should have been worried.

605
00:40:59,120 --> 00:40:59,840
How could it be

606
00:40:59,840 --> 00:41:01,040
I came here alone

607
00:41:01,430 --> 00:41:02,950
without any backup preparation.

608
00:41:08,320 --> 00:41:09,080
Lie again.

609
00:41:11,080 --> 00:41:11,990
It's quite hot.

610
00:41:12,230 --> 00:41:13,600
Stop talking nonsense.

611
00:41:14,190 --> 00:41:14,910
I've seen it.

612
00:41:14,910 --> 00:41:16,190
You guys did talk on the phone.

613
00:41:16,670 --> 00:41:17,950
However, he was the one who called you.

614
00:41:17,950 --> 00:41:19,270
You weren't the one who contacted him.

615
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:23,400
In addition, the call duration is written very clearly.

616
00:41:23,400 --> 00:41:24,360
Only 10 seconds.

617
00:41:24,670 --> 00:41:25,800
Are you sure in 10 seconds,

618
00:41:25,800 --> 00:41:27,160
can you say so many things?

619
00:41:30,670 --> 00:41:31,640
Feng Xiaosheng.

620
00:41:33,560 --> 00:41:34,990
You really like it more and more over time

621
00:41:34,990 --> 00:41:36,160
deceive yourself.

622
00:41:38,430 --> 00:41:39,360
You're absolutely sure

623
00:41:40,040 --> 00:41:42,560
the duration of my call with him was only 10 seconds?

624
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:45,400
Do you want to check WeChat?

625
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:47,040
What we talked about,

626
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:48,430
talk about how much.

627
00:41:50,470 --> 00:41:51,160
Look at it.

628
00:41:52,880 --> 00:41:53,950
Still stubborn.
