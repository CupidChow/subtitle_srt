1
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:29,940
=Under the Sun=

2
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:32,340
=Episode 8=

3
00:01:35,380 --> 00:01:37,700
The Dao Jian is nothing more than a killing knife.

4
00:01:38,860 --> 00:01:40,220
What we have to do now

5
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:42,860
not just getting this killer knife,

6
00:01:43,540 --> 00:01:46,180
but also want to cut off the hand holding the knife,

7
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:49,300
pulling out the real culprit hiding behind.

8
00:01:49,300 --> 00:01:51,100
Making him feel legal sanctions.

9
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:54,780
Chen always calls you Wu, right?

10
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,220
Everyone calls me Wu.

11
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:59,180
You now have two choices.

12
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,300
One, take the document that Chen gave you

13
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,700
and go to Lingbei to find your biological parents.

14
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:06,740
Second choice...

15
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:12,100
What are the two options?

16
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:18,300
I guess I don't need to say it.

17
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:22,460
I chose the second option.

18
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:25,940
Their Dao Jian is watching over me.

19
00:02:26,540 --> 00:02:27,940
I can't escape anywhere.

20
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:29,780
After all,

21
00:02:31,540 --> 00:02:33,100
I owe Uncle Chen too much.

22
00:02:36,860 --> 00:02:38,260
Are you sure?

23
00:02:39,100 --> 00:02:40,940
Once you board this ship,

24
00:02:42,340 --> 00:02:43,860
if you want to go down,

25
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:45,940
it won't be that easy.

26
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:50,620
No need to be afraid.

27
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,100
I have to go.

28
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:01,180
They told me to pick up people.

29
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:20,220
You're basic.

30
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,140
When you get busy you immediately lose track of time.

31
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:24,300
You have to take care of your own health, okay?

32
00:03:24,500 --> 00:03:25,180
Mom told you,

33
00:03:25,180 --> 00:03:26,060
you remember, yeah

34
00:03:26,060 --> 00:03:28,220
Next weekend, invite Yuze to eat at our house.

35
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:31,340
Your father's student gave us a big grouper.

36
00:03:31,700 --> 00:03:32,900
The fish is very fresh.

37
00:03:33,060 --> 00:03:34,580
I know you guys like it.

38
00:03:34,820 --> 00:03:36,220
Mother will cook for you.

39
00:04:05,860 --> 00:04:06,860
Shen Shijie,

40
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,580
don't overdo it.

41
00:04:10,300 --> 00:04:11,740
You really hate me, don't you?

42
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:14,340
Then, try to hate me well.

43
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:30,020
Regarding the Chunhui Steel Industry, that's the discussion here.

44
00:04:31,020 --> 00:04:32,620
Next, Qiao Yu continued the follow-up.

45
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:36,500
Lian Lian, tidy up the data in your hands,

46
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:37,820
immediately handed over to Qiao Yu.

47
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:40,220
Recently.

48
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,380
Ayo.

49
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:57,780
Alright, then, I'll go first.

50
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:06,460
Come on, the meeting is over.

51
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:09,980
No wonder your attitude suddenly changed,

52
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:12,860
apparently you are secretly planning something.

53
00:05:15,660 --> 00:05:17,100
You're waiting to enjoy the fruits of my labor, right?

54
00:05:27,220 --> 00:05:31,020
(Have arrived at the destination address.)

55
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:32,620
(Thank You.)

56
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:40,740
Just now someone was delivering this outside.

57
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:42,020
He said for you.

58
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:43,940
Of whom?

59
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:44,860
I don't know.

60
00:05:44,980 --> 00:05:47,180
A young man, he immediately left after putting away his letter.

61
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:48,220
Okay, thank you.

62
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:14,980
(Investigate the Feng Family, there is rot in it.)

63
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:22,060
Big journalist Lian,

64
00:06:22,820 --> 00:06:25,020
Since when can you dig through trash cans?

65
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,020
What does that mean?

66
00:06:29,380 --> 00:06:31,300
It's nothing, it's rubbish.

67
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:34,340
Rubbish? I don't believe it.

68
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,140
It doesn't matter whether you believe it or not.

69
00:06:36,260 --> 00:06:36,940
Kusarankan,

70
00:06:36,940 --> 00:06:38,580
just treat it as trash and throw it away.

71
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,260
Why?

72
00:06:41,860 --> 00:06:42,980
Xing Xiaohui.

73
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
Ever heard of it, no?

74
00:06:45,620 --> 00:06:46,540
Of course.

75
00:06:47,020 --> 00:06:48,540
Famous big journalist.

76
00:06:48,740 --> 00:06:50,540
Melamine scandal at that time,

77
00:06:50,620 --> 00:06:52,020
Xingya Electric Company's internal conflict

78
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,140
and also the Lei Fu scandal,

79
00:06:53,140 --> 00:06:54,620
he said it all.

80
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:56,100
I'm inspired by him,

81
00:06:56,100 --> 00:06:57,540
That's why I gave up my major in finance,

82
00:06:57,540 --> 00:06:58,700
and changed profession to become a journalist.

83
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:00,860
Do you know what he is doing now?

84
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,500
It seems like it's been a long time since I heard from him.

85
00:07:11,700 --> 00:07:14,140
Someone broke his leg.

86
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:15,620
Meanwhile his wife,

87
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,180
go take their children.

88
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,300
Now he...

89
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:19,940
being a paparazzi.

90
00:07:20,740 --> 00:07:21,860
How did you know?

91
00:07:22,740 --> 00:07:24,060
He is my teacher.

92
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:25,940
I know too,

93
00:07:25,940 --> 00:07:27,860
for investigating the Feng Group,

94
00:07:27,860 --> 00:07:29,100
that's why he was hit by this disaster.

95
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,460
I want to meet him.

96
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:34,060
Who?

97
00:07:34,060 --> 00:07:35,060
Xing Xiaohui.

98
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,300
I want to meet him today too.

99
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:37,460
Not...

100
00:07:57,940 --> 00:07:59,020
Why are you still following me?

101
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:00,460
We have held three meetings.

102
00:08:00,860 --> 00:08:02,140
Aren't you tired?

103
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:03,500
Chairman of the Board of Directors...

104
00:08:03,500 --> 00:08:04,180
I'm tired.

105
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:05,940
I want to rest for a while.

106
00:08:10,660 --> 00:08:11,420
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

107
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:13,580
Mr. Feng said he was tired.

108
00:08:44,860 --> 00:08:45,620
Lian Lian,

109
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,180
do you have time today to eat with me?

110
00:08:47,340 --> 00:08:48,100
Today, huh?

111
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,700
Can't do it this afternoon.

112
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:50,980
I have an appointment with someone.

113
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:53,100
Who?

114
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,940
Maybe the Handsome Qiao?

115
00:08:55,220 --> 00:08:56,660
Taking care of your own colleagues?

116
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:58,500
Don't talk about him.

117
00:08:58,580 --> 00:09:00,100
That person is very despicable.

118
00:09:00,580 --> 00:09:01,980
He stole the fruits of my labor.

119
00:09:02,580 --> 00:09:04,220
Even if that person has the ability,

120
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:06,260
but he has no morals, a lowly person.

121
00:09:07,540 --> 00:09:08,700
Suddenly changed, huh?

122
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:10,940
Previously because I was busy to the point of being stupid,

123
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:12,380
so you can feel he's not bad.

124
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:14,300
That's it, that's it.

125
00:09:14,500 --> 00:09:15,660
Next time we'll talk again.

126
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,820
If we're free, come on, meet and chat.

127
00:09:35,940 --> 00:09:36,860
Guru Xing.

128
00:09:36,980 --> 00:09:38,140
Very nice to meet you.

129
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:39,140
Please sit.

130
00:09:41,140 --> 00:09:42,300
- You can too. - Slowly.

131
00:09:42,980 --> 00:09:45,100
These are all my favorites.

132
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:47,980
It seems like...

133
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:50,980
Qiao Yu, that child hasn't forgotten me.

134
00:09:51,260 --> 00:09:52,980
How dare Qiao Yu forget you?

135
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:55,260
Every day in front of us, he was always, "my teacher, my teacher...",

136
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:56,460
make you proud.

137
00:09:57,260 --> 00:09:58,740
He couldn't possibly bring up anything about me.

138
00:09:59,820 --> 00:10:00,700
Did you know?

139
00:10:00,940 --> 00:10:02,660
Our last meeting

140
00:10:03,860 --> 00:10:05,420
also at this restaurant.

141
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,460
He slammed the table,

142
00:10:09,620 --> 00:10:12,940
even called me a coward.

143
00:10:14,460 --> 00:10:15,940
However, I don't blame him.

144
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:19,420
The teacher he was proud of ended up being a paparazzi.

145
00:10:20,260 --> 00:10:22,380
A profession that specializes in exploring people's privacy.

146
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:25,540
What a shame.

147
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,540
Teacher Xing, you shouldn't talk like that.

148
00:10:30,060 --> 00:10:31,140
According to me,

149
00:10:31,220 --> 00:10:33,380
You haven't left the team of investigative journalists.

150
00:10:34,100 --> 00:10:35,020
Paparazzi...

151
00:10:35,180 --> 00:10:36,620
even though the name is not pleasant to hear,

152
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:38,900
but still included as an investigative journalist.

153
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:40,420
The difference lies in

154
00:10:40,420 --> 00:10:43,140
we look for malpractices by businesses and governments,

155
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:44,180
while you,

156
00:10:44,180 --> 00:10:45,740
moving in the realm of morality,

157
00:10:45,740 --> 00:10:47,260
condemning decadent humanity.

158
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:48,780
Don't talk about this anymore,

159
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,300
let's just get to the point.

160
00:10:50,620 --> 00:10:51,620
What are you looking for me for?

161
00:10:53,660 --> 00:10:55,260
I almost forgot to pour you wine.

162
00:10:55,500 --> 00:10:56,780
Mari, mari, Guru Xing.

163
00:10:57,220 --> 00:10:58,020
Thank You.

164
00:10:58,740 --> 00:10:59,940
Thank you, thank you.

165
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:02,620
Today

166
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:05,980
I want to ask you

167
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:07,580
about the Feng Group.

168
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:15,900
What a shame this delicious food is.

169
00:11:16,780 --> 00:11:18,540
Teacher Xing, you should not leave yet.

170
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:20,740
I know you've had a lot of difficulties,

171
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,820
but you are a role model for Chinese investigative journalists.

172
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:27,260
I remember you once said,

173
00:11:27,580 --> 00:11:30,660
investigative journalists must serve the public interest,

174
00:11:31,020 --> 00:11:34,020
must dare to expose the dark side of public authorities and large business entities.

175
00:11:37,780 --> 00:11:39,220
I heard from Qiao Yu,

176
00:11:39,780 --> 00:11:41,500
You're the daughter of the deputy mayor.

177
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:43,460
Not afraid of heaven or earth.

178
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:45,460
Even though,

179
00:11:45,860 --> 00:11:47,140
I will still remind you.

180
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,100
Never touch it.

181
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,180
(Feng Xiaosheng; Shen Shijie; Polisi)

182
00:12:15,340 --> 00:12:16,580
Hello, Yuze.

183
00:12:16,900 --> 00:12:17,660
Where are you?

184
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:19,860
I'm preparing lessons on campus.

185
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:22,260
Why have you been so busy lately?

186
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:25,140
There was a lecturer who asked me

187
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:26,860
instead of teaching an important lesson for two days.

188
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,500
Am I not afraid of embarrassing myself in front of the students?

189
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:30,980
So, I got ready early.

190
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:33,140
Bu Ke is really too humble.

191
00:12:33,340 --> 00:12:35,420
I heard, Mrs. Ke's class

192
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,420
difficult to get a seat.

193
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:40,340
Tonight will you watch the night again?

194
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,140
That's right, I changed shifts with a colleague.

195
00:12:43,780 --> 00:12:44,660
Today awake,

196
00:12:44,660 --> 00:12:45,980
I can rest tomorrow.

197
00:12:46,460 --> 00:12:47,820
Don't work too hard either,

198
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:49,020
go home early and rest.

199
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,140
I know.

200
00:12:52,020 --> 00:12:53,380
Have you been sleeping well lately?

201
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:55,020
I heard from Tong Huan,

202
00:12:55,020 --> 00:12:56,540
You haven't looked for it in a long time.

203
00:12:57,260 --> 00:12:58,860
Is the mask previously finished painting?

204
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:03,980
Ying Ying, are you listening to me?

205
00:13:06,580 --> 00:13:07,340
Yes, I'm listening.

206
00:13:08,140 --> 00:13:09,420
Lately I've been sleeping pretty soundly,

207
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:10,860
that's why I don't go there anymore.

208
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:12,460
Never mind, let's finish for now.

209
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,780
Finish quickly, hurry home.

210
00:13:14,380 --> 00:13:16,620
Ying Ying, don't just answer.

211
00:13:17,540 --> 00:13:18,620
I'm not like that.

212
00:13:18,620 --> 00:13:19,860
You interrupted my thought process.

213
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:20,660
See you soon.

214
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,940
Well, you get busy first.

215
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,940
(Feng Xiaosheng; Shenshijie; Polisi)

216
00:13:30,940 --> 00:13:32,420
(Shen Shijie; Polisi)

217
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:38,460
(Police)

218
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:51,780
(Leaders)

219
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:54,340
(Dear Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission.)

220
00:13:54,460 --> 00:13:55,500
(My name is Ke Ying,)

221
00:13:55,700 --> 00:13:58,060
(a lecturer at the School of Management of Nanzhou University.)

222
00:13:58,580 --> 00:13:59,860
(I am also a victim of)

223
00:13:59,940 --> 00:14:02,180
(Robbery and murder case on March 14 in Nanzhou City.)

224
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:05,380
(Today, with real names, I report)

225
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,140
(Chairman of the Board of Directors of Nanzhou City Feng-Fuyong Holding Company,)

226
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:10,620
(Feng Xiaosheng.)

227
00:15:14,180 --> 00:15:14,940
What do you want?

228
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,780
Yu Chengbo?

229
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:23,580
Bu Ke,

230
00:15:23,900 --> 00:15:25,700
Have you had any problems lately?

231
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:27,260
Can you tell me?

232
00:15:27,820 --> 00:15:28,580
No.

233
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:31,220
Did your tutoring with Professor Fan go well?

234
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:32,900
Professor Fan is a good person.

235
00:15:33,380 --> 00:15:34,220
That's good then.

236
00:15:34,660 --> 00:15:36,780
Professor Fan is very skilled in his field.

237
00:15:37,180 --> 00:15:38,580
You will learn a lot from him.

238
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:41,340
Try to limit your part-time work outside of school.

239
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:42,980
After all, human energy is limited.

240
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:44,580
Don't sacrifice important things for side things.

241
00:15:46,260 --> 00:15:48,140
I'll remember that, don't worry.

242
00:15:48,900 --> 00:15:49,980
OK, I've arrived.

243
00:15:50,260 --> 00:15:51,220
Go home early and rest.

244
00:15:52,700 --> 00:15:53,180
I...

245
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:55,820
Mrs. Ke, you...

246
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:58,300
if you really have a problem,

247
00:15:58,300 --> 00:15:59,500
please tell me.

248
00:16:01,660 --> 00:16:03,060
You've helped me a lot.

249
00:16:03,980 --> 00:16:04,900
I'm very grateful.

250
00:16:05,900 --> 00:16:07,620
I can still do more things for you.

251
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:10,140
Thank You,

252
00:16:11,300 --> 00:16:12,420
but there are many things

253
00:16:12,780 --> 00:16:14,300
that we have to face ourselves.

254
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:16,980
You're like that, I'm the same.

255
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:25,180
No, don't pull it.

256
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:26,700
I feel this is right, the existing ones are even going up.

257
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,100
No, fine.

258
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,100
Just fine.

259
00:16:30,820 --> 00:16:31,420
Mother.

260
00:16:31,500 --> 00:16:34,500
The roots of your white hair have started to grow again.

261
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:35,700
Really?

262
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:36,700
Quick, quick, get me a mirror.

263
00:16:36,700 --> 00:16:37,900
I want to look in the mirror.

264
00:16:43,100 --> 00:16:46,380
I've been too busy lately to dye my hair.

265
00:16:47,940 --> 00:16:48,980
In my opinion,

266
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,780
You don't need to dye your hair anymore.

267
00:16:50,980 --> 00:16:54,420
Why make yourself look like a mannequin every day?

268
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:55,420
Is that necessary?

269
00:16:55,940 --> 00:16:56,900
People also say,

270
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:59,580
Hair dye is very dangerous for the body.

271
00:17:00,140 --> 00:17:01,660
No, what do you know?

272
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:04,940
Every day I have to deal with residents throughout the city.

273
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:08,180
Shouldn't I look neat and clean?

274
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,980
Do you think I'm the same as you?

275
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:12,140
Any clothes can be worn just like that.

276
00:17:12,500 --> 00:17:14,260
How many times have I told you,

277
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:16,820
no one is obliged

278
00:17:16,820 --> 00:17:18,620
ignoring your haphazard appearance...

279
00:17:18,620 --> 00:17:21,260
Then try to see your noble soul.

280
00:17:21,260 --> 00:17:22,420
Right, you know, yeah.

281
00:17:22,420 --> 00:17:23,780
You've repeated it hundreds of times.

282
00:17:24,900 --> 00:17:27,020
Alright, it's time.

283
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:27,980
Take medicine.

284
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:28,980
What's the time?

285
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,220
At 20.53.

286
00:17:31,980 --> 00:17:32,980
Less than seven minutes left.

287
00:17:34,620 --> 00:17:36,860
Aren't you too stiff?

288
00:17:37,700 --> 00:17:39,980
This is called being alert, understand?

289
00:17:40,020 --> 00:17:41,620
A random person like you,

290
00:17:41,620 --> 00:17:42,820
can that be called life?

291
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,140
OK, then, let's wait seven minutes.

292
00:17:47,700 --> 00:17:51,700
Well then, for your seven precious minutes,

293
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:53,300
Let me tell you a rumor.

294
00:17:53,620 --> 00:17:54,420
What's that?

295
00:17:56,380 --> 00:18:00,380
Do you know much about the Feng Group?

296
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:01,820
famous company,

297
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:03,780
contributed a lot to this city.

298
00:18:03,780 --> 00:18:04,460
Why?

299
00:18:04,980 --> 00:18:06,980
The news also says so.

300
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:11,460
However, it looks like the sealing of the nightclub this time

301
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:12,980
has something to do with the Feng Group.

302
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,500
I know about the sealing of nightclubs.

303
00:18:15,620 --> 00:18:18,140
However, whether it is related to the Feng Group or not, I don't know.

304
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,140
That's a matter for the police.

305
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:22,660
Mother, a few days ago,

306
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:23,900
I met someone.

307
00:18:24,220 --> 00:18:27,380
He was a teacher I used to really respect.

308
00:18:27,660 --> 00:18:28,420
However,

309
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,940
the current situation is very bad.

310
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,620
At first, someone broke his leg,

311
00:18:32,740 --> 00:18:33,500
not long after,

312
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:35,020
his family was scattered.

313
00:18:35,020 --> 00:18:36,300
Do you know why?

314
00:18:36,500 --> 00:18:38,900
Because he had investigated the Feng Family.

315
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:41,020
Really?

316
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,860
If I hadn't seen it with my own eyes,

317
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:43,980
I don't dare believe it either.

318
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:48,140
In that case...

319
00:18:48,900 --> 00:18:51,100
doesn't that mean there is mafia involvement?

320
00:18:51,940 --> 00:18:52,980
Actually,

321
00:18:52,980 --> 00:18:55,780
It's also not the first time I've encountered something like this.

322
00:18:56,660 --> 00:18:59,900
However, looking at the Feng Family's influence in Nanzhou...

323
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,180
That's it, that's it.

324
00:19:01,180 --> 00:19:02,420
Too extreme.

325
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:05,300
I'm telling you, yeah.

326
00:19:05,300 --> 00:19:07,740
Don't just investigate other people carelessly, okay?

327
00:19:08,300 --> 00:19:11,020
If your legs are broken, I will have to support you for the rest of your life.

328
00:19:11,740 --> 00:19:12,980
Say what's nicer to hear.

329
00:19:12,980 --> 00:19:14,100
Who am I?

330
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:17,180
I am your beloved daughter, the deputy mayor.

331
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:18,620
Who dares?

332
00:19:19,220 --> 00:19:20,660
Don't... don't laugh, don't laugh.

333
00:19:20,660 --> 00:19:21,540
- That's enough. - The mask is wrinkled.

334
00:19:21,540 --> 00:19:22,540
The time has come.

335
00:19:22,540 --> 00:19:23,300
- It has to be removed. - OK, OK.

336
00:19:23,300 --> 00:19:24,540
Here, from the bottom up.

337
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:25,580
I know, I know.

338
00:19:25,580 --> 00:19:26,580
Pat.

339
00:19:29,500 --> 00:19:31,900
Girls, I still have to curl my hair.

340
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:33,900
If someday

341
00:19:33,900 --> 00:19:35,460
you decided to investigate the Feng Group,

342
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:37,020
you have to tell me.

343
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:39,180
I told you, right?

344
00:19:39,820 --> 00:19:41,900
You will definitely protect me.

345
00:19:42,940 --> 00:19:43,700
I...

346
00:19:45,100 --> 00:19:47,380
I have to buy a wheelchair for you first.

347
00:19:47,580 --> 00:19:49,020
Are you my real mother?

348
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:50,180
Of course.

349
00:19:51,260 --> 00:19:52,420
Birth mother, take medicine.

350
00:19:55,300 --> 00:19:56,820
Here, two points, yes.

351
00:19:57,940 --> 00:19:59,420
This kid.

352
00:19:59,420 --> 00:20:00,420
Two, two.

353
00:20:00,420 --> 00:20:01,260
Of.

354
00:20:04,340 --> 00:20:05,620
What is written in here is

355
00:20:05,940 --> 00:20:09,100
the results of the basic investigation I conducted on the Feng Corporation.

356
00:20:09,700 --> 00:20:13,460
I think there are a lot of things that don't make sense in their company.

357
00:20:14,460 --> 00:20:16,940
So, I want to keep digging into it.

358
00:20:17,140 --> 00:20:18,540
There should be a lot of ingredients.

359
00:20:19,660 --> 00:20:21,180
You know about Xing Xiaohui, right?

360
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,900
Yesterday I just met him.

361
00:20:25,180 --> 00:20:28,580
Then, you should know quite well how difficult and dangerous this is.

362
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:31,340
Editor in chief,

363
00:20:31,940 --> 00:20:32,780
this time

364
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:34,140
You just need to tap the hammer on the question

365
00:20:34,540 --> 00:20:35,900
want to do it or not.

366
00:20:36,540 --> 00:20:37,900
The rest you don't need to worry too much about.

367
00:20:38,180 --> 00:20:39,340
I can really deal with it.

368
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:51,460
This time the situation, I have also explained the outline to my mother.

369
00:20:53,860 --> 00:20:55,180
He supports me very much.

370
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:57,780
Really.

371
00:21:01,180 --> 00:21:01,900
In that case, okay.

372
00:21:02,700 --> 00:21:04,140
You do whatever you like.

373
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:07,140
Thank you, Editor-in-Chief.

374
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,100
Halo.

375
00:21:24,100 --> 00:21:25,940
Oh, Deputy Mayor Lian, huh?

376
00:21:25,940 --> 00:21:27,100
Hello, hello.

377
00:21:31,260 --> 00:21:32,100
Fine.

378
00:21:32,100 --> 00:21:32,700
I understand, I understand.

379
00:21:35,140 --> 00:21:36,180
Fine.

380
00:21:36,700 --> 00:21:37,860
Fine.

381
00:21:44,860 --> 00:21:46,620
When people get old they become careless.

382
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,860
My mother usually takes medicine to lower my father's sugar levels.

383
00:21:49,060 --> 00:21:50,740
My mother fainted right then and there.

384
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:52,220
Really surprising.

385
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,620
Luckily there was someone by his side.

386
00:21:54,220 --> 00:21:55,300
He's all right now, right?

387
00:21:56,060 --> 00:21:57,220
Now it's okay.

388
00:21:57,340 --> 00:21:59,860
After being given a glucose injection at the hospital, he immediately regained consciousness.

389
00:22:00,540 --> 00:22:01,700
I'm just worried,

390
00:22:01,700 --> 00:22:03,980
there will be sequelae later, no?

391
00:22:04,460 --> 00:22:05,460
Quickly search on the internet.

392
00:22:05,460 --> 00:22:05,980
Correct.

393
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,580
(Pretty girl, let's go eat, I...)

394
00:22:11,500 --> 00:22:13,940
(Pretty girl, let's go eat, I'll treat you.)

395
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:16,660
(Is it necessary?)

396
00:22:16,660 --> 00:22:18,260
(No, regular casual dining.)

397
00:22:19,700 --> 00:22:20,620
Bu Ke.

398
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:23,140
Your boyfriend is a doctor, right?

399
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:27,140
However, he is a surgical specialist, his job is to operate.

400
00:22:36,100 --> 00:22:39,220
(I'm busy, there are a lot of classes these two days. Just another day.)

401
00:22:51,820 --> 00:22:52,860
Lian Lian.

402
00:22:57,460 --> 00:22:59,380
What other good things does the Editor-in-Chief agree with?

403
00:23:00,820 --> 00:23:01,860
You want to know, right?

404
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,060
I won't tell you.

405
00:23:18,020 --> 00:23:20,020
Then, I also tell you, don't get happy too quickly.

406
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:23,260
Mau hajar, ya?

407
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:25,540
Lian Lian.

408
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,860
Come here for a moment.

409
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:31,140
Good dogs don't get in the way, get out of the way!

410
00:26:43,220 --> 00:26:44,220
Are you home?

411
00:26:45,260 --> 00:26:45,980
Of.

412
00:26:46,460 --> 00:26:47,780
Why don't you turn on the lights?

413
00:26:49,460 --> 00:26:50,580
I fell asleep.

414
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:54,260
Why? Are you sick?

415
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:56,860
No, I'm just sleepy.

416
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,500
Why are you home already?

417
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:00,940
Don't you watch the night?

418
00:27:02,740 --> 00:27:04,100
Looks like you really forgot.

419
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:12,140
Today

420
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:15,260
is the seventh anniversary since we first met.

421
00:27:17,540 --> 00:27:18,340
Face...

422
00:27:19,820 --> 00:27:20,420
Sorry, sorry.

423
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,580
Sorry, I really...

424
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:22,780
- Excuse me. - It doesn't matter.

425
00:27:23,060 --> 00:27:24,500
You just need to rest well.

426
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,380
Sorry, I was wrong.

427
00:27:26,460 --> 00:27:27,420
I might forget this...

428
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,420
What is this?

429
00:27:29,420 --> 00:27:31,060
When making out, you don't know how to close the door, huh?

430
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:32,940
Why did you come?

431
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,580
Why can't I come?

432
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:37,220
When I was still sharing a bed with Ying Ying alone,

433
00:27:37,220 --> 00:27:38,420
it has nothing to do with you.

434
00:27:40,820 --> 00:27:42,620
Doctor Yang wants to cook today, okay?

435
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:45,180
Do you want to cook delicious food?

436
00:27:45,260 --> 00:27:46,540
Luckily I'm smart.

437
00:27:46,900 --> 00:27:50,180
Today I brought wine to my friend's meal.

438
00:27:52,020 --> 00:27:53,060
Lian Lian, begini.

439
00:27:53,460 --> 00:27:54,100
today

440
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,420
is our birthday reminder.

441
00:27:56,580 --> 00:27:57,660
I'll take the wine.

442
00:27:57,660 --> 00:27:58,700
If you have nothing to do, you can go first.

443
00:27:58,940 --> 00:27:59,420
Wait.

444
00:27:59,420 --> 00:28:01,100
Why even play hands?

445
00:28:01,380 --> 00:28:02,340
I'm telling you, yeah.

446
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:03,820
You're not family yet.

447
00:28:03,820 --> 00:28:05,140
Although already,

448
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,700
I'm still his big wife.

449
00:28:06,940 --> 00:28:07,820
Right, right?

450
00:28:07,820 --> 00:28:08,900
Don't touch my future wife.

451
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:09,620
Put your hands away.

452
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:11,460
Alright, hurry up.

453
00:28:11,460 --> 00:28:12,460
I'm hungry.

454
00:28:42,660 --> 00:28:43,660
Mr. Feng.

455
00:28:44,060 --> 00:28:45,020
Mr. Feng?

456
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,100
What is it?

457
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:51,140
The cooking is finished, please eat.

458
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,820
OK, I'll be right there.

459
00:28:54,220 --> 00:28:55,020
Good.

460
00:29:09,460 --> 00:29:10,900
Mr. Feng, enjoy.

461
00:29:10,900 --> 00:29:11,940
If anything happens, just call me.

462
00:29:13,220 --> 00:29:14,180
Bring a beer here.

463
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,060
Good.

464
00:29:24,140 --> 00:29:24,860
Let me be alone.

465
00:29:43,620 --> 00:29:44,100
Sis Wang

466
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,100
Call Gang here.

467
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:47,700
Good.

468
00:29:55,860 --> 00:29:56,940
Mr. Feng, you called me?

469
00:29:58,260 --> 00:29:58,860
Sister Wang,

470
00:29:58,940 --> 00:30:00,300
add a set of cutlery, then also get a beer glass.

471
00:30:00,700 --> 00:30:01,380
Good.

472
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:02,580
Sit down.

473
00:30:06,540 --> 00:30:07,540
Sit down, we eat together.

474
00:30:27,580 --> 00:30:28,220
Eat

475
00:31:05,220 --> 00:31:05,780
Drink.

476
00:31:08,820 --> 00:31:10,100
Master Feng, I can't drink wine.

477
00:31:15,540 --> 00:31:16,380
Then, sit down and continue eating.

478
00:31:38,540 --> 00:31:39,300
Eat the side dishes.

479
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:12,100
Sis Wang, after you finish tidying up, come home early.

480
00:32:12,460 --> 00:32:13,020
Good.

481
00:32:15,380 --> 00:32:16,780
Sit down, continue eating.

482
00:32:16,860 --> 00:32:17,660
Don't waste it.

483
00:33:33,140 --> 00:33:33,580
Okay,

484
00:33:33,700 --> 00:33:34,500
your turn.

485
00:33:34,620 --> 00:33:35,700
Tell me your hope.

486
00:33:35,820 --> 00:33:37,260
Why me again?

487
00:33:37,380 --> 00:33:39,380
Does this bottle have a grudge against me?

488
00:33:39,380 --> 00:33:42,140
Don't talk too much nonsense, say it quickly.

489
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:45,020
If angels could grant you one wish,

490
00:33:45,020 --> 00:33:46,460
what hope will you make?

491
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:48,460
I want you to disappear immediately.

492
00:33:49,140 --> 00:33:50,100
Lian Lian, you know, don't you?

493
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,260
Right now you're like a big 100 watt light bulb. [*disturbing people dating]

494
00:33:53,180 --> 00:33:54,780
Why do you keep doing that to me?

495
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:55,940
Am I really that radiant?

496
00:33:56,260 --> 00:33:58,860
This whole night apart from expressing his feelings for Ke Ying,

497
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:00,100
You just cursed me to disappear.

498
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,500
Your profession as a doctor is so noble,

499
00:34:03,500 --> 00:34:05,780
Could it be that your thoughts are also equally noble?

500
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:08,780
Wish for a world of peace or something.

501
00:34:09,500 --> 00:34:10,460
Great journalist Lian,

502
00:34:10,740 --> 00:34:11,620
then I'll ask you.

503
00:34:11,940 --> 00:34:13,220
What are your hopes?

504
00:34:13,860 --> 00:34:15,100
You have to be honest, yeah.

505
00:34:17,700 --> 00:34:19,220
My hope, yes...

506
00:34:21,900 --> 00:34:28,140
I am ready to follow in the footsteps of the true knights of yore,

507
00:34:29,220 --> 00:34:31,940
in the sleeping wilderness,

508
00:34:32,260 --> 00:34:33,740
stepping where my horse takes me.

509
00:34:34,740 --> 00:34:35,820
My destiny

510
00:34:35,980 --> 00:34:38,460
will become a touching legend.

511
00:34:39,580 --> 00:34:41,460
Following my own wishes,

512
00:34:41,860 --> 00:34:44,820
that will be my attitude in life.

513
00:34:45,620 --> 00:34:46,540
Time...

514
00:34:47,940 --> 00:34:52,260
in fact it passes in endless fantasy,

515
00:34:53,300 --> 00:34:58,740
or did he make lasting achievements in the wider world?

516
00:34:59,860 --> 00:35:00,860
At the moment...

517
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,220
Who is running while crying in this world?

518
00:35:04,540 --> 00:35:07,620
Who is running rampant while using violence in this world?

519
00:35:07,860 --> 00:35:09,660
When you open your eyes,

520
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:13,060
there are only cries that pity the weak.

521
00:35:13,380 --> 00:35:14,860
When you close your eyes,

522
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:19,100
there was only the howling of the wind from the roar of giant beasts.

523
00:35:19,380 --> 00:35:22,300
This world needs saving,

524
00:35:22,380 --> 00:35:26,260
need the great Knight Don Quixote!

525
00:35:29,100 --> 00:35:30,740
Two crazy people.

526
00:35:31,060 --> 00:35:31,980
I can't drink anymore.

527
00:35:33,100 --> 00:35:33,780
I go first.

528
00:35:34,620 --> 00:35:36,380
You're just thinking about leaving, aren't you?

529
00:35:37,380 --> 00:35:39,020
Yuze, sorry, okay?

530
00:35:39,340 --> 00:35:41,780
Today I have disturbed your romantic date with Ying Ying.

531
00:35:42,220 --> 00:35:43,780
You guys just continue another day.

532
00:35:43,820 --> 00:35:45,500
You definitely won't let us.

533
00:35:46,780 --> 00:35:47,380
I'll let you guys.

534
00:35:47,460 --> 00:35:48,580
I'm about to leave town.

535
00:35:51,300 --> 00:35:52,340
Didn't you just come back?

536
00:35:52,340 --> 00:35:53,260
Why go again?

537
00:35:53,460 --> 00:35:56,140
Our Editor-in-Chief insisted on me going out of town

538
00:35:56,140 --> 00:35:57,580
to make a follow-up report.

539
00:36:00,700 --> 00:36:02,140
This is completely out of control.

540
00:36:02,860 --> 00:36:03,660
Initially,

541
00:36:03,860 --> 00:36:05,580
I will investigate a very big case.

542
00:36:06,660 --> 00:36:08,220
Even he had agreed to it.

543
00:36:08,420 --> 00:36:10,420
However, the Editor-in-Chief suddenly retracted his words.

544
00:36:11,060 --> 00:36:13,380
He insisted on me following up on a vague report.

545
00:36:14,460 --> 00:36:15,820
Where do you think there is such a coincidence?

546
00:36:16,060 --> 00:36:16,900
What does this mean?

547
00:36:17,140 --> 00:36:18,980
This means that there must be a big problem in this.

548
00:36:21,140 --> 00:36:21,980
Stay cool.

549
00:36:22,340 --> 00:36:24,460
I definitely won't give up that easily.

550
00:36:25,580 --> 00:36:27,100
How could you get rid of me that easily?

551
00:36:27,980 --> 00:36:28,900
I've saved it here.

552
00:36:30,460 --> 00:36:31,060
Lian Lian,

553
00:36:31,540 --> 00:36:32,820
What big case do you want to investigate?

554
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:35,100
Our office received a letter.

555
00:36:35,860 --> 00:36:37,260
Inside the letter were written seven words.

556
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:40,820
Investigate the Feng Family, there is rot within it.

557
00:36:43,100 --> 00:36:44,580
Isn't that for Qiao Yu?

558
00:36:44,580 --> 00:36:45,820
Right, for Qiao Yu.

559
00:36:45,900 --> 00:36:47,620
He was so timid, how dare he handle it?

560
00:36:47,700 --> 00:36:49,140
So, I'll just take over this case.

561
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:51,620
The Editor-in-Chief has agreed,

562
00:36:51,620 --> 00:36:52,700
but not even half a day,

563
00:36:52,900 --> 00:36:53,900
suddenly changed his mind.

564
00:36:54,620 --> 00:36:56,700
Insisting on having me make an investigative report out of town.

565
00:36:58,340 --> 00:36:59,900
The leader arranged for you to go out of town,

566
00:36:59,900 --> 00:37:00,700
you just listen.

567
00:37:00,940 --> 00:37:02,100
He must have his own reasons.

568
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:03,700
Isn't it just because you're afraid of getting into trouble?

569
00:37:05,580 --> 00:37:06,660
Silly time with him.

570
00:37:07,660 --> 00:37:09,100
What Feng or Zheng Family,

571
00:37:09,100 --> 00:37:09,820
after I come back,

572
00:37:10,020 --> 00:37:11,220
I will continue to investigate to the roots!

573
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,580
Lian Lian, I'll take you.

574
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,220
No need.

575
00:37:15,220 --> 00:37:16,860
Just take care of your beloved lover.

576
00:37:19,020 --> 00:37:19,660
See you soon.

577
00:37:36,820 --> 00:37:37,740
I've investigated.

578
00:37:37,740 --> 00:37:39,500
All cell phone numbers are sold on the internet,

579
00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:41,100
absolutely no idea who bought it.

580
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:48,700
Who do you think this mysterious person is?

581
00:37:49,540 --> 00:37:51,340
Not only know about Shen Shijie,

582
00:37:51,580 --> 00:37:54,020
Even about me, he knows so clearly.

583
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:04,180
Boss, don't look at me like that.

584
00:38:04,380 --> 00:38:06,540
Even given three times the courage, I wouldn't dare to play with you either.

585
00:38:07,580 --> 00:38:09,700
Now we must quickly find this mysterious person.

586
00:38:10,060 --> 00:38:11,740
Every day we are played until we are overwhelmed,

587
00:38:11,900 --> 00:38:12,740
how can that be?

588
00:38:13,740 --> 00:38:15,380
Asking us to kill the police?

589
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:16,900
I'm horrified just thinking about it.

590
00:38:22,340 --> 00:38:23,220
Mysterious person?

591
00:38:34,580 --> 00:38:35,220
Halo.

592
00:38:38,020 --> 00:38:39,060
Mr. Feng, huh?

593
00:38:40,100 --> 00:38:40,580
What?

594
00:38:40,580 --> 00:38:41,500
Have you arrived here?

595
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:43,020
Sorry not welcoming, sorry not welcoming.

596
00:38:43,020 --> 00:38:43,940
I'll go there right now.

597
00:39:06,540 --> 00:39:07,220
This side.

598
00:39:46,140 --> 00:39:46,820
Okay.

599
00:39:48,260 --> 00:39:48,980
Ten thousand.

600
00:39:50,140 --> 00:39:51,140
OK, ten thousand.

601
00:39:52,140 --> 00:39:52,820
Mr. Feng,

602
00:39:53,620 --> 00:39:55,260
I won't make you bet much anymore.

603
00:39:55,260 --> 00:39:57,100
I will definitely win this round.

604
00:40:07,100 --> 00:40:07,740
Call, ten thousand.

605
00:40:08,980 --> 00:40:09,900
Add another ten thousand.

606
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,620
What cards do you have?

607
00:40:24,940 --> 00:40:26,020
You're probably bullying me, okay?

608
00:40:27,380 --> 00:40:28,500
I'll be honest with you,

609
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:29,540
this is my card

610
00:40:29,900 --> 00:40:30,700
really not small.

611
00:40:32,020 --> 00:40:33,220
I'm guessing it shouldn't be small either.

612
00:40:35,700 --> 00:40:36,580
A pair of aces, right?

613
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:46,140
You must be bullying me.

614
00:40:47,980 --> 00:40:48,620
Call.

615
00:40:49,180 --> 00:40:49,820
Open the card.

616
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:51,020
Pair of axles.

617
00:41:02,140 --> 00:41:04,020
Two pairs of Jacks and Kings, beating Aces.

618
00:41:12,340 --> 00:41:14,860
These two pairs of your cards... your acting is really good.

619
00:41:15,020 --> 00:41:16,220
I didn't expect it at all.

620
00:41:16,500 --> 00:41:17,820
I've always thought you were bluffing.

621
00:41:18,340 --> 00:41:19,540
However, after all,

622
00:41:19,540 --> 00:41:20,860
The cards in my hand are a pair of Aces.

623
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:22,540
It has to be opened, right?

624
00:41:23,060 --> 00:41:25,580
Defeated like this by you, it's a shame.

625
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,940
If you want to win, you have to learn to fold.

626
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:29,380
The losers are usually the greedy ones.

627
00:41:30,060 --> 00:41:31,500
I've guessed the cards in your hand.

628
00:41:31,500 --> 00:41:33,420
So, you have to think of a way to withdraw your chips.

629
00:41:34,620 --> 00:41:35,740
You don't study the cards in my hand,

630
00:41:35,740 --> 00:41:37,140
just greedy to raise.

631
00:41:38,620 --> 00:41:39,900
If you don't lose, who else will lose?

632
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,260
Be careful on the way.

633
00:43:00,740 --> 00:43:01,420
Pure Tea

634
00:43:01,860 --> 00:43:02,620
You are busy first.

635
00:43:07,060 --> 00:43:08,740
You think this is strange, don't you?

636
00:43:10,060 --> 00:43:10,860
What's weird?

637
00:43:12,100 --> 00:43:13,980
Big people like Mr. Feng

638
00:43:14,380 --> 00:43:15,940
can still play with us.

639
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:18,980
The emperor can also have fun with the people.

640
00:43:20,020 --> 00:43:21,540
Do you feel him

641
00:43:21,820 --> 00:43:23,340
very similar to someone?

642
00:43:23,980 --> 00:43:24,900
Who?

643
00:43:27,060 --> 00:43:28,500
