00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:33,020
=Episode 25=

3
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,900
These two days, I have to

4
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,340
prepare mid-semester exam material.

5
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:45,780
I didn't go to the company first.

6
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:47,500
Good.

7
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,900
I give you a suggestion.

8
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:54,100
Say.

9
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:56,420
For now, meetings can be held.

10
00:01:57,020 --> 00:01:58,780
However, don't just sign any documents

11
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,740
from anyone.

12
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:04,100
Understand.

13
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:06,740
If anyone doesn't understand,

14
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:07,740
just call me.

15
00:02:09,380 --> 00:02:10,100
Good.

16
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:24,620
If there's nothing, I'll go first.

17
00:02:55,620 --> 00:02:59,420
(Incoming Call; Feng Xiaosheng)

18
00:02:59,740 --> 00:03:00,580
Halo.

19
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:01,820
Ke Ying.

20
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,260
I know,

21
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:05,940
even though now saying this all,

22
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,300
maybe it's no use anymore.

23
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:10,580
However, I

24
00:03:10,580 --> 00:03:12,060
still want to tell you...

25
00:03:13,980 --> 00:03:14,740
sorry

26
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:18,820
Previous problems...

27
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:24,020
Ying?

28
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:26,020
If there's nothing, I'll close it first.

29
00:03:29,380 --> 00:03:30,180
Halo.

30
00:03:32,860 --> 00:03:33,700
Ying.

31
00:03:34,260 --> 00:03:35,020
Ying!

32
00:04:02,420 --> 00:04:03,420
Let him go.

33
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:05,740
Tell them to stop and let him go!

34
00:04:06,820 --> 00:04:08,580
Who are you talking to?

35
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:10,140
I'm talking to you,

36
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:10,860
Feng Yong.

37
00:04:11,060 --> 00:04:12,580
Tell them to let him go!

38
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:50,220
Give me the bag!

39
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:09,540
I'm the one who doesn't handle matters well.

40
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,740
It's not your fault.

41
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:15,740
It's just that something is crazy.

42
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:20,860
We made a mistake.

43
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:23,940
It should be that time

44
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:25,860
we can't find fugitives like him!

45
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:30,620
Sheng...

46
00:05:31,780 --> 00:05:33,100
I might think,

47
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:35,940
if you help him out of a dead end,

48
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:37,260
at least

49
00:05:37,580 --> 00:05:38,780
there must be gratitude,

50
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:40,780
so, it is easier to handle it.

51
00:05:44,500 --> 00:05:45,860
It was because Sheng was too kind.

52
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:48,980
How could he have thought of it,

53
00:05:49,340 --> 00:05:49,900
in this world,

54
00:05:49,900 --> 00:05:51,220
there are still ungrateful people.

55
00:05:54,580 --> 00:05:56,500
God is unfair.

56
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,220
Could it be him?

57
00:05:58,220 --> 00:05:59,580
already knows that he is

58
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:02,100
not from the Feng family?

59
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:04,340
Know it or not

60
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:06,140
it's no longer important.

61
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:10,580
I already understand it.

62
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,900
He is one

63
00:06:13,180 --> 00:06:15,020
an indiscriminate depraved wolf.

64
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,420
Even his biological father,

65
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:19,340
if need be bitten,

66
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:21,700
he would still bite him.

67
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:25,580
If so, next...

68
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:53,420
Take care, yes.

69
00:06:54,180 --> 00:06:55,100
You owe me your life.

70
00:06:57,100 --> 00:06:58,540
It's clear you owe me.

71
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,620
Good.

72
00:07:02,620 --> 00:07:03,660
Consider me the one who owes you.

73
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:05,780
Give me the water.

74
00:07:12,860 --> 00:07:14,060
Why drink so much water?

75
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:15,340
Speeds up metabolism.

76
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:17,260
So that the medicine can wear off quickly.

77
00:08:14,260 --> 00:08:15,180
Hello, Mom.

78
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:16,500
Mom called me, okay?

79
00:08:17,140 --> 00:08:18,980
It's you, yeah.

80
00:08:19,260 --> 00:08:20,020
Why don't you

81
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:21,140
pick up the phone from me?

82
00:08:22,180 --> 00:08:23,140
What's your cell phone?

83
00:08:23,140 --> 00:08:25,420
just used as decoration?

84
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,380
Not so.

85
00:08:27,380 --> 00:08:28,340
I was teaching

86
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,220
So, I turned off the cell phone.

87
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:30,700
Soon I'll be home.

88
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:32,820
You want to go home, right?

89
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:34,420
So, be careful on the road, okay?

90
00:08:34,420 --> 00:08:35,010
Of.

91
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:35,650
Stay cool.

92
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,010
You're really good at lying

93
00:08:41,010 --> 00:08:42,010
it doesn't even need preparation.

94
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:56,940
Why force yourself?

95
00:08:59,500 --> 00:09:00,580
Call them again,

96
00:09:00,780 --> 00:09:01,860
and say not coming home today.

97
00:09:07,260 --> 00:09:07,940
Lately,

98
00:09:07,940 --> 00:09:09,980
my parents are very sad.

99
00:09:11,220 --> 00:09:12,620
Today is my father's birthday.

100
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:14,100
If I don't come home too,

101
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,340
do you really want me

102
00:09:16,340 --> 00:09:17,940
broke up with my father?

103
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:25,500
Finished.

104
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,220
Look no further.

105
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,060
He must be stuck in traffic.

106
00:09:38,060 --> 00:09:39,340
It's up to you whether you want to come or not.

107
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:41,980
You're angry, aren't you?

108
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:44,260
You're sulking at your own daughter, aren't you?

109
00:09:45,820 --> 00:09:46,660
Base.

110
00:09:57,380 --> 00:09:58,420
The.

111
00:10:00,420 --> 00:10:01,740
I think,

112
00:10:01,740 --> 00:10:03,860
our words at that time to Ying Ying

113
00:10:04,700 --> 00:10:06,100
seems a little outrageous.

114
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:08,460
What do you think we do?

115
00:10:08,460 --> 00:10:09,260
interfere

116
00:10:09,260 --> 00:10:10,740
young people's love affairs?

117
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:14,740
Yuze doesn't hate Ying Ying.

118
00:10:15,500 --> 00:10:16,420
After all,

119
00:10:16,820 --> 00:10:18,700
they both are also not married.

120
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,860
Even though you're married,

121
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,620
You can also still feel incompatible and get divorced.

122
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,500
I think, Ying Ying

123
00:10:26,940 --> 00:10:28,580
not that kind of person.

124
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,580
He does this

125
00:10:29,580 --> 00:10:31,060
there must be a reason of its own.

126
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:35,500
He's gone home.

127
00:10:38,500 --> 00:10:39,460
Ying Ying.

128
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:40,460
Mother father.

129
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:41,340
I am home.

130
00:10:48,180 --> 00:10:49,940
Ha... just you?

131
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,500
He was out of town on duty.

132
00:10:54,940 --> 00:10:56,300
Working out of town?

133
00:10:56,860 --> 00:10:58,620
OK, OK.

134
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:00,620
Why buy cake?

135
00:11:00,620 --> 00:11:01,620
that big?

136
00:11:01,820 --> 00:11:03,420
If you don't finish it, it will be wasted.

137
00:11:03,740 --> 00:11:05,100
Quickly go wash your hands and eat.

138
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:05,740
Go away.

139
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,700
Go away, go away.

140
00:11:06,700 --> 00:11:07,420
Good.

141
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:14,460
You quickly put away your sullen face.

142
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:16,180
It's a good day.

143
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:17,180
Don't make trouble.

144
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:27,620
(Happy family, always warm, I always love you, Ying Ying)

145
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:29,140
Well, look quickly.

146
00:11:29,140 --> 00:11:30,020
What is it?

147
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:31,460
(Happy family, always warm, I always love you, Ying Ying)

148
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:33,500
Truly your beloved daughter.

149
00:11:36,940 --> 00:11:38,260
Hurry, sit down.

150
00:11:39,460 --> 00:11:40,180
Good.

151
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,300
What are you doing?

152
00:11:41,300 --> 00:11:42,420
Pour wine for your father.

153
00:11:42,620 --> 00:11:44,740
Celebrating your birthday.

154
00:11:46,580 --> 00:11:47,420
Think quickly

155
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:49,140
What wish do you want to make next?

156
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,700
Why turn off the lights?

157
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:02,340
These are the rules.

158
00:12:02,340 --> 00:12:03,500
Hurry up and make an application.

159
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:04,500
Good.

160
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:08,180
I hope...

161
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:09,380
Wait.

162
00:12:10,060 --> 00:12:11,100
You have to make a wish in your heart,

163
00:12:11,100 --> 00:12:12,260
can't say it.

164
00:12:13,260 --> 00:12:13,980
No.

165
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:16,180
Today is my 60th birthday.

166
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,460
I have to say it.

167
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:19,940
Mother.

168
00:12:20,460 --> 00:12:21,700
Just listen to father's words.

169
00:12:23,100 --> 00:12:23,860
Okay.

170
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,300
Time goes by so fast.

171
00:12:30,660 --> 00:12:32,660
In an instant already 60 years old.

172
00:12:33,940 --> 00:12:36,540
Sixty years is one Jiazi period.

173
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,540
Looking back over these 60 years,

174
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,300
the sweet and bitterness of life

175
00:12:42,940 --> 00:12:44,660
I've passed it before.

176
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:47,300
What I have to do

177
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:49,420
almost everything has been realized.

178
00:12:50,740 --> 00:12:52,820
For the past,

179
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,380
I have no regrets.

180
00:12:56,300 --> 00:12:57,500
For the future,

181
00:12:59,740 --> 00:13:01,820
I only have one request.

182
00:13:05,940 --> 00:13:07,580
Hopefully my wife

183
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:10,900
stay healthy

184
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:14,780
and happy every day.

185
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:18,500
For my daughter,

186
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:23,780
I hope the work goes smoothly,

187
00:13:24,580 --> 00:13:26,340
peaceful and happy.

188
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:28,860
Apart from this,

189
00:13:30,020 --> 00:13:31,220
no longer.

190
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:38,620
My husband.

191
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,900
Blow out the candle.

192
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:57,100
Come here and sit.

193
00:13:58,740 --> 00:13:59,740
Just say it straight.

194
00:14:05,860 --> 00:14:06,540
Even though you

195
00:14:06,540 --> 00:14:08,420
don't like your current identity,

196
00:14:09,540 --> 00:14:11,460
but I have to still call you Sheng.

197
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:17,820
Sheng.

198
00:14:19,180 --> 00:14:20,620
Have you ever thought,

199
00:14:21,940 --> 00:14:24,020
why does this woman want to help you?

200
00:14:25,540 --> 00:14:26,620
He has

201
00:14:27,380 --> 00:14:28,980
a very deep grudge against you.

202
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,940
Where possible he tried with all his heart

203
00:14:31,940 --> 00:14:33,340
help you check your company account.

204
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:36,620
What's the goal?

205
00:14:36,700 --> 00:14:37,340
You don't have to

206
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:38,900
no matter what the goal is.

207
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:40,020
From you

208
00:14:40,020 --> 00:14:41,300
create a fake car project.

209
00:14:41,660 --> 00:14:42,740
What is your goal?

210
00:14:43,740 --> 00:14:45,820
Aoxin's car is not a trick.

211
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:48,260
That was Sheng's dream.

212
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:49,620
Dream?

213
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:51,900
His dream

214
00:14:52,580 --> 00:14:53,860
is cheating people, huh?

215
00:14:54,780 --> 00:14:56,340
Not much better than me.

216
00:14:56,820 --> 00:14:58,380
Sheng does not deceive people.

217
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:03,100
The car factory he built in Germany

218
00:15:04,300 --> 00:15:05,860
will soon mass produce.

219
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:09,060
Mobile Aoxin

220
00:15:09,300 --> 00:15:10,540
is not a hoax.

221
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:12,660
It is

222
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:14,380
a gift from Sheng to everyone.

223
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:21,900
Last year,

224
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:25,940
Sheng finds out that he has an illness.

225
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:30,540
Until the end of last year, he was diagnosed as unable to recover.

226
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:34,620
Lord

227
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:37,140
leaving him too little time.

228
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,020
He couldn't help but move quickly.

229
00:15:42,660 --> 00:15:43,940
Mobile Aoxin

230
00:15:44,460 --> 00:15:45,620
almost used

231
00:15:45,820 --> 00:15:47,420
all company funds.

232
00:15:50,620 --> 00:15:52,620
In order to avoid breaking the capital chain,

233
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:55,420
all funds that can be used

234
00:15:55,420 --> 00:15:57,460
must be issued to get out of the crisis.

235
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:00,300
So,

236
00:16:01,340 --> 00:16:04,500
the Aoxin car should be launched earlier

237
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:05,620
and ordered faster.

238
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:09,420
Taking advantage of the momentum to get a down payment,

239
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,380
Facilitate relationships with banks

240
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:15,180
and build trust

241
00:16:15,180 --> 00:16:17,260
investors and suppliers.

242
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:20,660
Extending what must be extended,

243
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:22,460
contracts that had to be continued, were also continued.

244
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:25,900
Fight for the Feng Group to survive.

245
00:16:28,500 --> 00:16:29,780
Three months.

246
00:16:30,700 --> 00:16:32,260
It only takes three months,

247
00:16:33,220 --> 00:16:34,300
Feng family

248
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:36,780
will be able to rise again.

249
00:16:46,460 --> 00:16:48,020
Very good and touching.

250
00:16:48,100 --> 00:16:49,340
However, what does that have to do with me?

251
00:16:49,340 --> 00:16:50,580
That was his dream.

252
00:16:50,580 --> 00:16:51,940
I also don't like dreaming.

253
00:16:52,780 --> 00:16:54,060
All I want is money.

254
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,900
Money?

255
00:16:56,900 --> 00:16:57,940
Correct.

256
00:16:58,980 --> 00:17:00,340
Who doesn't like money?

257
00:17:01,180 --> 00:17:02,580
You put me in the company

258
00:17:02,580 --> 00:17:03,780
as a mascot.

259
00:17:04,020 --> 00:17:05,140
Of course you can't

260
00:17:05,140 --> 00:17:07,140
using only silver pieces worth 1.8 million

261
00:17:07,140 --> 00:17:09,260
to get rid of me, right?

262
00:17:09,260 --> 00:17:11,140
I'm not a beggar either.

263
00:17:12,220 --> 00:17:13,660
How much money do you want?

264
00:17:20,050 --> 00:17:22,290
I am also part of the Feng family.

265
00:17:23,860 --> 00:17:26,460
For the sake of considering your own company...

266
00:17:29,420 --> 00:17:30,220
Otherwise, it's like this.

267
00:17:31,380 --> 00:17:33,180
I want half of it

268
00:17:33,300 --> 00:17:34,500
down payment for Aoxin's car.

269
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:37,620
Now,

270
00:17:38,860 --> 00:17:40,900
already more than twenty thousand cars have been ordered.

271
00:17:42,260 --> 00:17:44,220
The down payment was more than billions of yuan.

272
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:49,780
You want half?

273
00:17:51,900 --> 00:17:53,300
Too little, huh?

274
00:17:54,620 --> 00:17:56,340
This money is used by the company

275
00:17:57,100 --> 00:17:58,460
for emergencies!

276
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:05,140
Not giving me this money is also fine.

277
00:18:05,460 --> 00:18:06,420
You use it first.

278
00:18:07,100 --> 00:18:08,820
Later I will sell some of my shares

279
00:18:09,020 --> 00:18:10,660
to get through my life.

280
00:18:10,900 --> 00:18:12,180
I heard that the chairman of the board of directors

281
00:18:12,180 --> 00:18:13,540
I want to sell shares, it seems

282
00:18:13,820 --> 00:18:15,460
have to make an announcement, right?

283
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:19,580
Very troublesome.

284
00:18:20,540 --> 00:18:21,900
It's okay if it's a hassle.

285
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:22,740
Who told

286
00:18:22,740 --> 00:18:24,380
I am part of the Feng family?

287
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:26,940
Must prioritize company profits.

288
00:18:36,460 --> 00:18:37,220
Ying Ying.

289
00:18:37,300 --> 00:18:38,220
Put it here first.

290
00:18:38,780 --> 00:18:40,260
I want to talk to you about something serious.

291
00:18:40,500 --> 00:18:41,780
When will you bring

292
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:43,060
Feng is here?

293
00:18:44,020 --> 00:18:45,620
Don't look at your father without a voice.

294
00:18:45,860 --> 00:18:47,900
In his heart he longed to meet her.

295
00:18:48,860 --> 00:18:49,540
I ask you,

296
00:18:49,540 --> 00:18:50,700
don't just stay silent.

297
00:18:51,980 --> 00:18:53,260
I listened to him.

298
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:57,180
You two are engaged,

299
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,220
we still haven't met him,

300
00:18:59,220 --> 00:19:00,020
especially,

301
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:01,780
meeting between two large families.

302
00:19:02,060 --> 00:19:04,020
You're not right, aren't you?

303
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:11,940
He is busy.

304
00:19:12,060 --> 00:19:13,540
Every day here and there.

305
00:19:14,540 --> 00:19:15,900
Is it true that if you're busy you don't eat?

306
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:19,180
Find a meal time to meet him,

307
00:19:19,180 --> 00:19:20,500
not too much, right?

308
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:22,020
Good.

309
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:22,980
I'll take him another day,

310
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:23,780
of?

311
00:19:25,180 --> 00:19:25,940
My wife.

312
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,620
Where are my glasses?

313
00:19:29,260 --> 00:19:30,780
It's under the tea table.

314
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:33,780
Why didn't I find it?

315
00:19:34,260 --> 00:19:35,780
You look for it yourself.

316
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:36,540
Go away.

317
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:37,660
I have become

318
00:19:37,660 --> 00:19:38,780
Doraemon your father.

319
00:19:38,780 --> 00:19:39,740
You see for yourself.

320
00:19:40,140 --> 00:19:41,180
Slowly, yes.

321
00:19:41,180 --> 00:19:41,940
Give it to me.

322
00:19:44,380 --> 00:19:45,300
Where?

323
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:47,740
Isn't it here?

324
00:19:48,300 --> 00:19:49,260
Look at it.

325
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:00,540
It's okay to give you the money.

326
00:20:02,180 --> 00:20:03,900
The company will be yours sooner or later.

327
00:20:05,660 --> 00:20:07,300
Also it's okay you spend

328
00:20:07,900 --> 00:20:09,020
this money.

329
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,300
However...

330
00:20:17,220 --> 00:20:18,500
Want to discuss a deal with me?

331
00:20:21,420 --> 00:20:22,980
Now there are journalists

332
00:20:23,380 --> 00:20:25,300
who was investigating the problems of the car factory.

333
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:30,380
You fixed this problem for me

334
00:20:32,060 --> 00:20:33,700
and I'll give you half the down payment.

335
00:20:36,260 --> 00:20:37,180
Lian Lian?

336
00:20:37,860 --> 00:20:38,620
Correct.

337
00:20:40,220 --> 00:20:42,260
Looks like your Ke Ying

338
00:20:42,660 --> 00:20:43,860
who leaked it to him.

339
00:20:46,620 --> 00:20:48,780
It is very suitable to hand over this problem

340
00:20:49,900 --> 00:20:51,020
for you to take care of.

341
00:20:52,380 --> 00:20:53,500
Not Ke Ying.

342
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,660
You are now burning alive

343
00:20:58,940 --> 00:21:00,180
without you realizing it.

344
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,620
Been obsessed.

345
00:21:05,660 --> 00:21:06,780
Be careful.

346
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,780
Don't play with fire and burn yourself.

347
00:21:15,900 --> 00:21:16,420
You don't have to

348
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:17,540
don't care about Ke Ying.

349
00:21:17,940 --> 00:21:19,060
After tidying up Lian Lian,

350
00:21:20,420 --> 00:21:21,420
give half the down payment.

351
00:21:47,780 --> 00:21:48,460
Ayah.

352
00:21:50,500 --> 00:21:51,540
I'll help you put it in.

353
00:21:51,860 --> 00:21:52,540
No need, no need.

354
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:53,700
These photos

355
00:21:53,700 --> 00:21:55,460
sorted by time.

356
00:21:55,780 --> 00:21:56,540
You don't know.

357
00:21:56,540 --> 00:21:57,780
It's better for me to be alone.

358
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:58,500
Good.

359
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:00,780
Mari.

360
00:22:00,780 --> 00:22:01,780
Stop first

361
00:22:01,780 --> 00:22:02,740
and eat the fruit.

362
00:22:02,740 --> 00:22:04,060
Come, come, come.

363
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:12,060
The phone rings.

364
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:12,700
I'll just pick it up.

365
00:22:14,740 --> 00:22:16,260
Halo.

366
00:22:20,060 --> 00:22:21,900
Ying Ying, for you.

367
00:22:24,140 --> 00:22:24,860
Halo.

368
00:22:25,420 --> 00:22:26,060
Ying Ying.

369
00:22:27,740 --> 00:22:29,220
Young people now

370
00:22:29,300 --> 00:22:31,260
everyone likes taking photos using cellphones

371
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:32,900
or digital camera.

372
00:22:33,140 --> 00:22:33,940
Arriving at the place,

373
00:22:33,940 --> 00:22:36,460
immediately took so many photos.

374
00:22:37,020 --> 00:22:38,020
However, once the cellphone is replaced

375
00:22:38,020 --> 00:22:38,940
or lost.

376
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:40,060
All photos will also be lost.

377
00:22:40,540 --> 00:22:41,660
So, photos

378
00:22:41,660 --> 00:22:42,860
must be washed

379
00:22:42,860 --> 00:22:44,220
can then be stored properly.

380
00:22:46,060 --> 00:22:47,500
Today is my uncle's 60th birthday.

381
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:49,740
I called to ask how he was.

382
00:22:53,020 --> 00:22:53,900
How are you?

383
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,300
Who?

384
00:22:59,540 --> 00:23:00,060
Nobody.

385
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:00,780
Just my colleague.

386
00:23:02,260 --> 00:23:03,740
Her colleague Ying Ying.

387
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:04,980
Mother.

388
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:05,780
This photo of you

389
00:23:05,780 --> 00:23:07,500
really very good.

390
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,020
Good.

391
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,940
You see first who took the photo.

392
00:23:10,940 --> 00:23:12,660
Light, angle,

393
00:23:12,660 --> 00:23:13,940
and image composition.

394
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:17,300
That's because I'm photogenic.

395
00:23:17,700 --> 00:23:18,380
Truly.

396
00:23:18,380 --> 00:23:19,380
Correct.

397
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:21,740
I didn't make a mistake in looking for a wife.

398
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,020
Ying Ying.

399
00:23:24,180 --> 00:23:25,060
Eat the fruit.

400
00:23:26,020 --> 00:23:26,900
Mother, I'm not eating.

401
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,820
I'm on a diet.

402
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:28,740
What is a diet for?

403
00:23:28,740 --> 00:23:29,620
Look at you

404
00:23:29,620 --> 00:23:31,140
thin as a sheet of paper.

405
00:23:31,340 --> 00:23:32,700
Come on, eat it.

406
00:23:35,340 --> 00:23:35,900
Ayah.

407
00:23:35,900 --> 00:23:37,220
How many photos did you wash?

408
00:23:37,220 --> 00:23:38,220
Did you wash all the photos

409
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,020
what's in the phone?

410
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:39,700
Correct.

411
00:23:39,700 --> 00:23:41,820
I washed it in an online shop.

412
00:23:41,820 --> 00:23:42,900
Washing photos in online stores

413
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:44,500
not only cheap and easy,

414
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,940
also delivered to your home.

415
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:47,340
It's really nice.

416
00:23:47,740 --> 00:23:48,340
The.

417
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:49,660
You washed so many photos,

418
00:23:49,660 --> 00:23:51,700
This photo album won't be enough.

419
00:23:51,700 --> 00:23:52,780
Have to buy another new one.

420
00:23:53,660 --> 00:23:54,900
Let's try entering it first.

421
00:23:55,340 --> 00:23:57,740
If it doesn't work, we buy it again.

422
00:23:57,740 --> 00:23:58,380
I'll tell you.

423
00:23:58,380 --> 00:23:59,780
Must pay attention when buying.

424
00:24:00,300 --> 00:24:02,620
Must buy exactly this one.

425
00:24:02,660 --> 00:24:03,700
If not,

426
00:24:03,700 --> 00:24:05,420
it will fall apart when you put it.

427
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:07,020
Good.

428
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:14,300
Ying Ying.

429
00:24:14,740 --> 00:24:16,340
What did Yuze say to you?

430
00:24:19,780 --> 00:24:22,540
He wishes dad a happy birthday.

431
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:21,860
Mother.

432
00:25:22,100 --> 00:25:23,380
I received a call first.

433
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:24,580
Ayah.

434
00:25:24,580 --> 00:25:25,740
I'll take the call first, okay?

435
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:26,460
Good.

436
00:25:42,860 --> 00:25:43,580
Halo.

437
00:25:44,540 --> 00:25:45,340
Halo.

438
00:25:46,620 --> 00:25:47,860
Are you still at your mother and father's house?

439
00:25:48,620 --> 00:25:49,300
Of.

440
00:25:53,620 --> 00:25:54,580
What's the problem?

441
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:57,300
I'm downstairs now.

442
00:25:58,340 --> 00:25:59,500
You'll see me when you come down.

443
00:26:01,940 --> 00:26:02,660
Good.

444
00:26:18,220 --> 00:26:19,020
Very good.

445
00:26:19,020 --> 00:26:19,780
Actually this kid...

446
00:26:19,780 --> 00:26:20,460
Ayah.

447
00:26:20,940 --> 00:26:22,060
There is a little problem

448
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:23,020
with my students.

449
00:26:23,940 --> 00:26:25,020
I should probably go.

450
00:26:25,020 --> 00:26:26,300
I have to take care of it.

451
00:26:26,860 --> 00:26:27,700
Hurry up and go.

452
00:26:27,700 --> 00:26:28,900
Children's problems are more important.

453
00:26:29,300 --> 00:26:30,020
What the hell?

454
00:26:30,020 --> 00:26:30,660
It is late.

455
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,900
Just let your father take you.

456
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:32,540
No need.

457
00:26:33,380 --> 00:26:34,860
It's not very late.

458
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:36,340
Mother.

459
00:26:36,340 --> 00:26:37,660
I also really want to accompany father

460
00:26:37,660 --> 00:26:38,940
past his birthday.

461
00:26:39,340 --> 00:26:40,060
However, what can be done,

462
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,820
Who told me to be a lecturer?

463
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:42,860
The most important student problem,

464
00:26:42,860 --> 00:26:43,580
True, or not?

465
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:44,860
Truly.

466
00:26:44,860 --> 00:26:45,620
Hurry up and go.

467
00:26:45,940 --> 00:26:46,860
Be careful on the way.

468
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:47,300
Good.

469
00:26:47,300 --> 00:26:47,980
Stay cool.

470
00:26:48,260 --> 00:26:49,420
- No need to worry. - Yes, yes.

471
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:50,660
Be careful on the road, yes.

472
00:26:51,060 --> 00:26:51,660
Ayah.

473
00:26:52,260 --> 00:26:53,260
Happy birthday.

474
00:26:53,340 --> 00:26:53,940
Fine.

475
00:26:53,940 --> 00:26:54,900
Thank you, thank you.

476
00:26:54,900 --> 00:26:55,540
I'm going, yeah.

477
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:57,260
See you soon.

478
00:26:57,260 --> 00:26:57,740
I'll go first, okay?

479
00:26:57,740 --> 00:26:58,700
Be careful on the road, yes.

480
00:26:58,700 --> 00:26:59,300
See you soon.

481
00:27:18,500 --> 00:27:19,340
Actually you don't need to

482
00:27:19,340 --> 00:27:20,540
specifically to pick me up.

483
00:27:21,540 --> 00:27:22,940
This afternoon it was like that,

484
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:23,820
Big Boss Feng

485
00:27:23,820 --> 00:27:25,420
For now it shouldn't bother me.

486
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,460
I've arrived at the door.

487
00:28:08,660 --> 00:28:09,940
You can go home.

488
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:29,060
What do you want?

489
00:28:29,980 --> 00:28:30,540
Do you still want to

490
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,220
check every

491
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:32,180
room in my house?

492
00:28:32,980 --> 00:28:34,500
Haven't you installed surveillance cameras?

493
00:28:34,500 --> 00:28:35,620
Just monitor from there.

494
00:28:36,700 --> 00:28:37,260
Don't pretend to be stupid,

495
00:28:37,260 --> 00:28:37,980
you're tired, aren't you?

496
00:28:38,860 --> 00:28:40,180
Quickly pack your things and come with me.

497
00:28:41,540 --> 00:28:42,420
What do you mean?

498
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,420
You should know what I mean.

499
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,620
I don't know.

500
00:28:46,780 --> 00:28:47,340
I just know

501
00:28:47,340 --> 00:28:48,180
our previous cooperation

502
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:48,900
pretty fun.

503
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:50,140
I don't want any changes.

504
00:28:50,140 --> 00:28:50,900
I want to.

505
00:28:57,580 --> 00:28:58,260
Follow it.

506
00:28:59,420 --> 00:29:00,100
Listen to my words.

507
00:29:01,100 --> 00:29:02,060
Pack your things

508
00:29:02,340 --> 00:29:03,180
and stay at my place.

509
00:29:05,020 --> 00:29:05,780
As a replacement,

510
00:29:05,780 --> 00:29:06,700
I can promise you.

511
00:29:08,460 --> 00:29:09,700
As long as you stay at my place,

512
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:11,780
I won't go to your parents' house again.

513
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:01,540
Sis.

514
00:32:05,580 --> 00:32:06,300
I...

515
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:11,300
What really happened?

516
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:14,500
A word or two

517
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:15,620
I can't explain it to you either.

518
00:32:16,620 --> 00:32:17,660
When tailing Ba Lian,

519
00:32:17,660 --> 00:32:18,940
I fell into the valley

520
00:32:18,940 --> 00:32:20,020
and was unconscious for two days.

521
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:21,540
Luckily there was a farmer who saved me.

522
00:32:21,540 --> 00:32:22,820
Otherwise, my life will also be lost.

523
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:24,020
Then, I went home and rushed to take a shower,

524
00:32:24,020 --> 00:32:24,500
change clothes

525
00:32:24,500 --> 00:32:25,460
come straight here to meet you.

526
00:32:27,580 --> 00:32:28,500
What is this?

527
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,700
What happened?

528
00:32:31,020 --> 00:32:32,020
This bunch of bastards

529
00:32:32,100 --> 00:32:33,180
bullying me because I'm new,

530
00:32:33,180 --> 00:32:34,700
accidentally put something in my car,

531
00:32:35,300 --> 00:32:36,380
then directed me

532
00:32:36,380 --> 00:32:37,420
all the way to Mount Yuncang.

533
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:42,580
Then Ba Lian

534
00:32:42,780 --> 00:32:43,860
and I moved a tree.

535
00:32:43,860 --> 00:32:45,660
He left me there and ran away.

536
00:32:46,260 --> 00:32:47,100
During the trip,

537
00:32:47,100 --> 00:32:48,700
I'm like a fool played by them.

538
00:32:48,940 --> 00:32:50,260
I was shocked and troubled.

539
00:32:50,260 --> 00:32:51,100
With 5000 yuan

540
00:32:51,100 --> 00:32:52,380
want to chase me away.

541
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:54,420
I don't want to do it.

542
00:32:54,860 --> 00:32:55,780
Plus,

543
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:56,540
I don't know either

544
00:32:56,540 --> 00:32:57,740
what are they actually carrying?

545
00:32:57,740 --> 00:32:59,100
Where there is a face back to see you.

546
00:32:59,460 --> 00:33:00,820
So, I continued to tail Ba Lian

547
00:33:00,820 --> 00:33:01,980
through hills and valleys.

548
00:33:02,260 --> 00:33:03,220
Finally I understand

549
00:33:03,220 --> 00:33:04,700
what are they actually carrying?

550
00:33:04,700 --> 00:33:05,900
and where the goods come from.

551
00:33:06,620 --> 00:33:07,620
Don't make me curious.

552
00:33:08,260 --> 00:33:09,140
What are they carrying?

553
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:12,740
It's not.

554
00:33:28,060 --> 00:33:28,980
I can't sleep.

555
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,180
Can I borrow a book from your book room?

556
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:33,140
Go away.

557
00:33:33,500 --> 00:33:34,460
The door is not locked.

558
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:56,340
Mr. Feng.

559
00:33:57,100 --> 00:33:58,500
You and Miss Ke already live together?

560
00:33:58,740 --> 00:33:59,460
You just said

561
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:00,460
they transport gold?

562
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:03,980
Ya, emas.

563
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,060
It's all wrapped inside an electromagnetic coil.

564
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:08,260
In total there were more than 20 people carrying him.

565
00:35:42,580 --> 00:35:43,700
What book are you reading?

566
00:35:45,940 --> 00:35:46,700
Novel.

567
00:35:50,180 --> 00:35:51,020
Are you done chatting?

568
00:35:51,740 --> 00:35:52,500
Already.

569
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:53,660
He has gone?

570
00:35:54,900 --> 00:35:55,620
Already.

571
00:35:56,460 --> 00:35:57,700
Lend me the book.

572
00:35:57,700 --> 00:35:58,940
I went to sleep first.

573
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:08,100
Were you eavesdropping?

574
00:36:10,940 --> 00:36:11,660
Of.

575
00:36:12,860 --> 00:36:13,580
Why?

576
00:36:13,940 --> 00:36:14,940
Curious.

577
00:36:15,900 --> 00:36:16,940
If you were me,

578
00:36:16,940 --> 00:36:18,180
Aren't you curious?

579
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:19,460
What have you heard?

580
00:36:19,620 --> 00:36:21,380
Smuggling, lifting goods,

581
00:36:21,860 --> 00:36:22,940
it's not.

582
00:36:24,900 --> 00:36:26,500
However, if you think about it, it's also very strange.

583
00:36:27,100 --> 00:36:28,660
Obviously the Feng Group's money can be moved

584
00:36:28,660 --> 00:36:30,300
abroad through

585
00:36:30,300 --> 00:36:31,300
overseas investment channels.

586
00:36:32,100 --> 00:36:33,380
Why should you use

587
00:36:33,380 --> 00:36:34,740
such an ancient way?

588
00:36:35,900 --> 00:36:37,220
There must be other problems.

589
00:36:40,340 --> 00:36:41,500
You're very smart.

590
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,940
Your line of logic is very clear.

591
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,900
As smart as anything

592
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:46,420
will also still be detained by you here.

593
00:36:55,740 --> 00:36:56,660
Don't mess around.

594
00:36:57,060 --> 00:36:58,620
If you really have that thought,

595
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,740
You won't let me sleep in the guest room.

596
00:37:02,860 --> 00:37:03,860
Thank you for the book.

597
00:37:14,100 --> 00:37:14,700
Why this script

598
00:37:14,700 --> 00:37:15,860
not publishable?

599
00:37:23,100 --> 00:37:24,340
There's no why.

600
00:37:25,340 --> 00:37:26,180
This is for your good.

601
00:37:29,540 --> 00:37:30,580
I don't need to.

602
00:37:31,700 --> 00:37:33,140
Do you know how many people

603
00:37:33,140 --> 00:37:34,700
Who will be involved if this manuscript is published?

604
00:37:36,700 --> 00:37:37,860
Not only the Feng Group

605
00:37:37,860 --> 00:37:39,140
who will fall into the vortex of public opinion,

606
00:37:39,740 --> 00:37:40,540
but also the government

607
00:37:40,540 --> 00:37:41,700
and related members.

608
00:37:42,900 --> 00:37:43,700
Even your mother,

609
00:37:43,700 --> 00:37:46,100
deputy mayor, will be affected.

610
00:37:50,180 --> 00:37:51,060
Lian.

611
00:37:52,700 --> 00:37:53,900
Before doing anything,

612
00:37:53,900 --> 00:37:55,060
must be thought about deeply

613
00:37:55,060 --> 00:37:56,460
and consider the consequences.

614
00:37:57,580 --> 00:37:59,180
It can't just be a momentary emotion.

615
00:38:00,100 --> 00:38:01,340
I'm not emotional for a moment.

616
00:38:02,060 --> 00:38:03,540
I've thought about it very clearly.

617
00:38:04,460 --> 00:38:05,620
Have you considered everything?

618
00:38:08,060 --> 00:38:08,860
Editor in chief.

619
00:38:09,860 --> 00:38:10,820
Do you still remember

620
00:38:10,820 --> 00:38:11,540
your word to me

621
00:38:11,540 --> 00:38:13,060
when I just came to work?

622
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,220
I remember everything.

623
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:19,620
I didn't forget a single word.

624
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:24,140
I remember you once said,

625
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:25,700
although

626
00:38:25,700 --> 00:38:27,300
the sun shines on the whole earth

627
00:38:27,580 --> 00:38:28,860
this place we live,

628
00:38:29,700 --> 00:38:31,580
but there are lots of small places

629
00:38:31,940 --> 00:38:33,500
who don't get sunlight.

630
00:38:35,540 --> 00:38:37,340
They are covered with dark clouds,

631
00:38:37,580 --> 00:38:39,220
covered in weeds,

632
00:38:39,540 --> 00:38:41,100
blocked by flooding.

633
00:38:42,380 --> 00:38:43,900
How many people keep groping

634
00:38:43,900 --> 00:38:45,100
in their confusion.

635
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:46,300
Meanwhile we,

636
00:38:46,580 --> 00:38:48,180
person holding a torch.

637
00:38:48,820 --> 00:38:49,460
Our existence

638
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:51,380
can only give them hope of survival.

639
00:38:52,700 --> 00:38:53,940
You once said,

640
00:38:53,940 --> 00:38:55,620
there is a new belief there is freedom.

641
00:38:55,620 --> 00:38:57,180
It is better to die than not to be serious.

642
00:38:57,420 --> 00:38:58,180
Hence, this article

643
00:38:58,180 --> 00:38:59,380
must be published!

644
00:39:00,620 --> 00:39:02,420
Announce everything we know

645
00:39:02,420 --> 00:39:03,700
to the public.

646
00:39:05,420 --> 00:39:07,020
No matter how many people will be involved,

647
00:39:07,820 --> 00:39:09,220
they should pay up

648
00:39:09,220 --> 00:39:10,300
their actions.

649
00:39:12,980 --> 00:39:13,740
Even though...

650
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,460
she is my mother.

651
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,900
Hello teacher.

652
00:39:30,980 --> 00:39:31,860
Qiao Yu.

653
00:39:32,180 --> 00:39:34,540
How was your and Lian Lian's research process?

654
00:39:34,540 --> 00:39:35,700
about the Feng Group?

655
00:39:38,060 --> 00:39:39,620
Is the manuscript finished?

656
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,940
Then bring it here for me to see.

657
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:43,740
Correct.

658
00:39:43,940 --> 00:39:45,100
Come here now.

659
00:39:45,340 --> 00:39:46,420
I happen to be at home.

660
00:39:47,380 --> 00:39:47,900
Oh yes,

661
00:39:48,180 --> 00:39:49,580
You came alone, okay?

662
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:51,540
Don't bring that Miss Lian Lian.

663
00:39:51,540 --> 00:39:52,940
He is too noisy.

664
00:39:52,940 --> 00:39:54,820
I get dizzy when I meet him.

665
00:39:57,940 --> 00:39:58,980
Editor in chief.

666
00:40:02,980 --> 00:40:03,940
You go back first.

667
00:40:04,500 --> 00:40:05,820
I will consider this matter again.

668
00:40:05,820 --> 00:40:07,700
What else needs to be considered?

669
00:40:09,100 --> 00:40:09,860
Lian Lian.

670
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:12,500
I understand your mood now,

671
00:40:13,340 --> 00:40:14,620
but I also hope you can understand

672
00:40:14,620 --> 00:40:15,220
my situation,

673
00:40:15,220 --> 00:40:15,940
of?

674
00:40:19,860 --> 00:40:20,660
Okay.

675
00:40:21,140 --> 00:40:21,940
I hope you can

676
00:40:21,940 --> 00:40:23,180
make a decision as soon as possible.

677
00:40:29,940 --> 00:40:31,700
What are you looking at? You guys don't have jobs, do you?

678
00:41:54,180 --> 00:41:54,580
Nice shot.

679
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:55,540
Again, again, again.

680
00:42:05,420 --> 00:42:05,940
Come on, come on.

681
00:42:13,460 --> 00:42:14,140
Give it to me.

682
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:19,700
Good.

683
00:42:20,060 --> 00:42:21,060
Good, good shot!

684
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:24,180
This side.

685
00:42:24,180 --> 00:42:24,980
I'll watch again.

686
00:42:31,940 --> 00:42:32,700
Good!

687
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:34,340
You can come in too.

688
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:36,580
You guys play.

689
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:37,700
Here, I have business looking for you.

690
00:42:38,060 --> 00:42:38,500
See you soon.

691
00:42:39,020 --> 00:42:39,700
I'll get clothes first.

692
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:40,140
Good.

693
00:42:58,620 --> 00:42:59,220
How?

694
00:43:02,060 --> 00:43:03,140
My father had a habit of recording.

695
00:43:03,140 --> 00:43:04,140
When there is a suspicious case,

696
00:43:04,140 --> 00:43:05,300
he will definitely record everything.

697
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:09,740
(This thinking is very strange.)

698
00:43:10,260 --> 00:43:11,620
(However, he is very afraid)

699
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:12,740
(and very serious too.)

700
00:43:13,220 --> 00:43:14,540
(In front of me, he even)

701
00:43:14,700 --> 00:43:15,940
(following Feng Xiaosheng from behind)

702
00:43:15,940 --> 00:43:17,540
(and called him by the name of Shen Shijie.)

703
00:43:17,900 --> 00:43:20,300
(Feng Xiaosheng has no response at all.)

704
00:43:20,620 --> 00:43:22,340
(However, later in the video,)

705
00:43:22,700 --> 00:43:23,540
(I realized that)

706
00:43:23,540 --> 00:43:25,020
(when Feng Xiaosheng heard)

707
00:43:25,020 --> 00:43:26,260
(nama Shen Shijie,)

708
00:43:26,260 --> 00:43:27,740
(her hands subconsciously)

709
00:43:27,740 --> 00:43:29,780
(responds by clenching his fists.)

710
00:43:29,900 --> 00:43:30,940
(This proves)

711
00:43:30,940 --> 00:43:32,780
(Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie)

712
00:43:32,780 --> 00:43:35,180
(it is very possible to have a relationship.)

713
00:43:37,620 --> 00:43:38,660
