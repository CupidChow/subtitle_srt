5
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:54,420
Are you following me, Sis?

6
00:01:56,700 --> 00:01:57,980
Hello, Mr. Feng.

7
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:01,500
That... we've met before.

8
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,020
At the forum event location.

9
00:02:03,020 --> 00:02:05,020
I... I volunteered for that event.

10
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:18,260
I'm the person who welcomes you into the event location.

11
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,220
Do you remember?

12
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:21,860
I've forgotten.

13
00:02:22,180 --> 00:02:23,260
What are you following me for?

14
00:02:23,860 --> 00:02:24,340
I...

15
00:02:28,300 --> 00:02:29,580
I'm not following you.

16
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:30,660
That...

17
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,460
I'm a fan of Mr. Feng.

18
00:02:32,980 --> 00:02:34,420
All your reports, I've heard them.

19
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:35,780
I really admire you.

20
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:37,780
You're my inspiration.

21
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:39,020
So,

22
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,780
can i have your autograph

23
00:02:58,660 --> 00:02:59,580
Thank you, Mr. Feng.

24
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,780
You really didn't say anything?

25
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:23,020
Calm down, Sis Qiang.

26
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:24,540
Our mouths are tightly closed.

27
00:03:25,340 --> 00:03:26,340
After all,

28
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:28,060
This isn't the first time I've been there either.

29
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:33,420
Then, why did the police let you go?

30
00:03:34,340 --> 00:03:35,940
Lately I haven't committed any violations either,

31
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:37,460
why do they have to lock me up?

32
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:40,940
Kak Qiang,

33
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,380
I look outside...

34
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:43,980
Hua Zi?

35
00:03:45,820 --> 00:03:48,060
Hua Zi, why have you come out?

36
00:03:49,060 --> 00:03:51,180
You won't have any trouble in there, right?

37
00:03:51,260 --> 00:03:51,820
No.

38
00:03:52,220 --> 00:03:53,020
That's good.

39
00:03:53,780 --> 00:03:54,780
Di mana Pi Ku dan Leng Tou?

40
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,020
Still squatting at the police station.

41
00:03:59,780 --> 00:04:01,700
Why are you the only one released?

42
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:07,060
no,

43
00:04:07,060 --> 00:04:08,940
Wu, what do you mean?

44
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:11,100
What does it mean that I'm the only one who was released?

45
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:12,100
Calm down first.

46
00:04:12,100 --> 00:04:14,020
Don't think anything strange.

47
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:16,220
I... I didn't mean anything weird.

48
00:04:18,250 --> 00:04:19,250
Based on your words,

49
00:04:20,420 --> 00:04:21,930
even though we're not looking for people to get them out,

50
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:23,020
Pi Ku and Leng Tou will also be released.

51
00:04:23,020 --> 00:04:24,140
Ya, 'kan, Kak Qiang?

52
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:25,140
Wu.

53
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:27,420
Did you say what's going on outside?

54
00:04:28,940 --> 00:04:30,060
I look outside,

55
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:31,940
parked car carrying furniture.

56
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:33,540
Furniture transporter?

57
00:04:40,460 --> 00:04:42,140
You've worked hard, bro.

58
00:04:42,220 --> 00:04:43,780
Slowly, slowly.

59
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:45,220
Don't hit it and break it.

60
00:04:47,540 --> 00:04:48,180
Kak Qiang.

61
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:48,940
Kak Kan.

62
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:50,740
There is also Wu apparently.

63
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:51,420
Kak Kan.

64
00:04:52,020 --> 00:04:53,220
You are...

65
00:04:54,500 --> 00:04:57,020
Sis Meng said, recently this club has been neglected,

66
00:04:57,020 --> 00:04:58,100
kinda messed up,

67
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,260
So, asked me to help watch him for a few days.

68
00:05:00,580 --> 00:05:02,460
Once he finds the right person, it will be arranged again.

69
00:05:04,340 --> 00:05:07,060
Later, when my office is tidy, you guys come and drink tea.

70
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:08,620
Fine, fine, fine.

71
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:11,540
After tidying up, I will entertain you.

72
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:25,020
He's using the office that Dao Jian used to use, right?

73
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,900
Judging from this,

74
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:27,460
Does that mean Sis Kan will continue Dao Jian's work?

75
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:28,860
Kak Qiang,

76
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:30,900
how is the background?

77
00:05:34,540 --> 00:05:35,460
You don't know, right?

78
00:05:35,740 --> 00:05:37,460
Sis Kan is not an ordinary person.

79
00:05:37,620 --> 00:05:39,660
He was the most important person in second uncle's heart.

80
00:05:39,980 --> 00:05:40,780
Little second aunt.

81
00:05:40,780 --> 00:05:41,780
Little second aunt, you understand?

82
00:05:41,900 --> 00:05:42,900
Your two heads.

83
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:44,780
Little second aunt?

84
00:05:46,100 --> 00:05:47,380
If second uncle hears this,

85
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:48,540
your other leg will also be broken.

86
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,700
Come, Brother Qiang, drink some tea.

87
00:05:57,780 --> 00:05:58,780
Try a little, Sis.

88
00:06:03,540 --> 00:06:04,460
Sis Kan, this is it,

89
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,340
was also kicked out of this place in the past.

90
00:06:06,740 --> 00:06:08,260
He used to be the club boss.

91
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,100
He has many beautiful girls under him.

92
00:06:12,100 --> 00:06:13,340
How dignified.

93
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:16,220
Then, this matter reached second aunt's ears,

94
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,540
so, second aunt came and finished him off.

95
00:06:18,820 --> 00:06:20,220
Finally the second uncle moved him

96
00:06:20,220 --> 00:06:21,820
and opened a Japanese restaurant elsewhere.

97
00:06:26,220 --> 00:06:27,740
Seeing today,

98
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:29,340
it looks like this place wants to be revived.

99
00:06:30,060 --> 00:06:34,220
Wasn't he afraid that second aunt would come and finish him off and throw him out again?

100
00:06:34,580 --> 00:06:35,420
Why?

101
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,660
Second uncle's household affairs, you also want to interfere?

102
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:38,380
No.

103
00:06:38,740 --> 00:06:39,900
I just want to hear gossip.

104
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,660
Come on, Sis Qiang.

105
00:06:40,660 --> 00:06:41,220
Come on, have some tea.

106
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:42,700
Come on, don't gossip anymore.

107
00:06:43,220 --> 00:06:44,820
Wu, come with me out.

108
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:57,860
Brother Qiang, I'm coming too, okay?

109
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:01,540
You don't have to.

110
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:03,420
You just enjoy your chicken here.

111
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:04,060
Eat it.

112
00:07:04,940 --> 00:07:05,860
Go first, okay?

113
00:07:20,020 --> 00:07:20,860
Kak Qiang.

114
00:07:21,300 --> 00:07:23,380
In my opinion, in the future we want to open a restaurant

115
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,460
which specializes in selling seafood like this,

116
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:26,780
can also make money.

117
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:30,500
It requires large investment capital.

118
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,460
Do you have one?

119
00:07:32,020 --> 00:07:32,900
I don't have any.

120
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:34,300
I don't have either.

121
00:07:40,980 --> 00:07:42,180
You wait for me here for a moment.

122
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:18,060
Smuggling?

123
00:08:20,620 --> 00:08:21,860
With second uncle's current condition,

124
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:23,620
still have to take this risk and return to his old profession?

125
00:08:29,060 --> 00:08:30,140
He didn't say what was smuggled?

126
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,930
This is not discussed in detail.

127
00:08:33,050 --> 00:08:34,900
However, I assume this is big business.

128
00:08:35,020 --> 00:08:35,570
If not,

129
00:08:35,570 --> 00:08:37,620
he won't ask me to contact old relations.

130
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:41,500
Just calm down,

131
00:08:41,690 --> 00:08:42,690
if there's any more movement,

132
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:44,500
I will report it to you immediately.

133
00:08:45,820 --> 00:08:46,580
One more.

134
00:08:47,060 --> 00:08:48,300
Bring Wu often,

135
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:50,060
build him well.

136
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,020
Fine.

137
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:54,340
I understand, I understand.

138
00:09:15,380 --> 00:09:18,700
(Feng Xiaosheng)

139
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,460
Now it has to move faster.

140
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:24,180
(New Development Land)

141
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:54,060
Miss Ke.

142
00:10:55,540 --> 00:10:56,380
You must be tired, right?

143
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:57,460
Drink a cup of coffee.

144
00:10:58,060 --> 00:10:58,820
Thank You.

145
00:11:02,780 --> 00:11:04,260
Please tidy up this table.

146
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:05,140
A temporary transaction journal is not required.

147
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:06,380
Put it back in the meeting room.

148
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:07,700
Good.

149
00:11:21,460 --> 00:11:23,100
Supervisor Yuan didn't say anything, right?

150
00:11:23,820 --> 00:11:26,660
He? What can he say?

151
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:32,820
It seems like he's not afraid of being examined.

152
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,580
However, he is really good at bookkeeping.

153
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:36,820
If there's a chance,

154
00:11:36,820 --> 00:11:38,460
I also want to learn from him.

155
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,140
Sis Ke,

156
00:11:41,580 --> 00:11:43,020
You don't praise him anymore.

157
00:11:43,700 --> 00:11:45,100
If you praise him again,

158
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,140
he will float away and forget himself.

159
00:11:55,300 --> 00:11:57,260
Why didn't your chairman of the board of directors come today?

160
00:12:02,540 --> 00:12:03,580
That is true.

161
00:12:04,340 --> 00:12:06,060
He also didn't say he had anything to do.

162
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,660
Sorry, sorry.

163
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:21,420
What's wrong with you?

164
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,460
Bring a beat-up electric motorbike and crash here and there!

165
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:25,140
If it scratches my car, will you be able to compensate me?

166
00:12:28,260 --> 00:12:29,220
What did you say?

167
00:12:32,180 --> 00:12:33,220
What did you say just now?

168
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:36,220
Why an electric motorbike?

169
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:37,900
Is there a problem with you?

170
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:41,060
You are called looking down on people.

171
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:44,700
I have a Mercedes, but I don't use it.

172
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,340
I really like driving electric motorbikes, why is that?

173
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,660
Low carbon emissions, environmentally friendly, get it, right?

174
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:53,540
Isn't my car better than yours?

175
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,700
Bro,

176
00:12:58,380 --> 00:13:00,020
So people don't act like that.

177
00:13:00,820 --> 00:13:02,140
What is this?

178
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:44,500
The shop has been around for a long time.

179
00:13:45,100 --> 00:13:46,460
The owner's name is Li Mingshan.

180
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:48,420
So far, we have not found any irregularities.

181
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,100
Only shop selling aquatic products.

182
00:13:51,380 --> 00:13:52,620
I heard, business is pretty good.

183
00:13:54,340 --> 00:13:55,340
Impossible.

184
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,540
What is You Qiang looking for?

185
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:02,380
I've sent someone to investigate.

186
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,100
Stay cool.

187
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,220
No matter what stealth,

188
00:14:04,220 --> 00:14:05,820
I will definitely make them reveal their true form.

189
00:14:06,660 --> 00:14:08,220
You guys should hurry up and investigate.

190
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,660
You Qiang asked me to be on call 24 hours a day for these two days,

191
00:14:10,660 --> 00:14:11,700
don't turn off your cell phone.

192
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:13,540
Pages,

193
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,220
in these two days there will definitely be a big movement.

194
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,420
Anyway in these two days.

195
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:26,540
If only in these two days...

196
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:28,380
I was suddenly taken away,

197
00:14:30,020 --> 00:14:31,900
can't provide information, how?

198
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,380
Kapten Xiao,

199
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:35,020
how about like this?

200
00:14:35,020 --> 00:14:37,020
You also give me advanced items.

201
00:14:37,020 --> 00:14:38,300
For example, voice listening devices,

202
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:39,180
tracking device,

203
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:39,900
What...

204
00:14:39,900 --> 00:14:41,180
po... basically this kind of stuff.

205
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:41,700
You know, right?

206
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,900
If my situation is threatened,

207
00:14:42,900 --> 00:14:44,140
i can tell you,

208
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:46,740
You can send a rescue squad for me, right?

209
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,980
You watch too many movies, huh?

210
00:14:48,980 --> 00:14:49,580
Nope.

211
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:51,980
Isn't that real?

212
00:14:53,740 --> 00:14:54,900
Not completely fictional.

213
00:14:56,180 --> 00:14:58,260
Such technology does exist,

214
00:14:58,420 --> 00:14:59,380
but it can't be used.

215
00:14:59,380 --> 00:15:00,300
Why?

216
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,020
Once these items are found,

217
00:15:02,020 --> 00:15:03,620
I don't even know how to die.

218
00:15:04,740 --> 00:15:06,540
We've had bitter experiences,

219
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,620
can't happen to you again.

220
00:15:09,700 --> 00:15:10,940
Wu, I'll tell you, yeah.

221
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,900
Whatever problems you encounter later,

222
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,060
any item is unreliable,

223
00:15:15,340 --> 00:15:16,380
can only rely on humans.

224
00:15:19,420 --> 00:15:20,700
I will act according to the situation.

225
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,300
If there's a chance,

226
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:27,100
I will teach you to use a gun.

227
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,580
We'll use guns too, right?

228
00:15:30,940 --> 00:15:32,140
Just in case.

229
00:15:37,780 --> 00:15:38,460
Kapten Xiao,

230
00:15:39,020 --> 00:15:41,260
Recently I felt that something was wrong with Ke Ying.

231
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:45,380
What's wrong?

232
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,980
I can't explain it,

233
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,580
this is just instinct.

234
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:51,900
I feel, her relationship with Feng Xiaosheng is not that simple.

235
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,140
The two of them are definitely not just lovers.

236
00:15:55,300 --> 00:15:56,540
Have you investigated it?

237
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:58,180
I mean to, but I don't dare.

238
00:15:58,740 --> 00:16:00,540
Because of our current relationship

239
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:02,060
quite complicated.

240
00:16:03,580 --> 00:16:04,540
Our relationship was strained.

241
00:16:04,540 --> 00:16:05,540
I'm still not an expert.

242
00:16:07,900 --> 00:16:08,860
Okay.

243
00:16:09,580 --> 00:16:11,060
Don't worry about this anymore.

244
00:16:11,060 --> 00:16:12,420
I will send someone else to investigate.

245
00:16:13,860 --> 00:16:14,620
Kapten Xiao,

246
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:20,820
a few days ago, Feng Xiaosheng gifted me a car.

247
00:16:21,820 --> 00:16:23,220
Gift you a car?

248
00:16:23,420 --> 00:16:23,980
Correct.

249
00:16:24,460 --> 00:16:25,500
Did you drive it here?

250
00:16:26,420 --> 00:16:26,900
Of.

251
00:16:26,900 --> 00:16:27,860
It's below.

252
00:16:27,860 --> 00:16:29,180
I'll show you later.

253
00:16:29,820 --> 00:16:30,460
You...

254
00:16:31,900 --> 00:16:32,740
Look how panicked you are.

255
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:33,660
Afraid, right?

256
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,180
Am I that stupid?

257
00:16:35,780 --> 00:16:38,380
If a sound-tapping or tracking device is installed,

258
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:39,660
won't we both end?

259
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:42,780
Here, let me show you how great it is.

260
00:16:42,940 --> 00:16:43,820
Mercedes.

261
00:16:51,740 --> 00:16:52,620
What are you doing?

262
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:57,300
What are you looking at?

263
00:16:57,300 --> 00:16:58,660
Never seen a luxury car key, huh?

264
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:09,580
No money.

265
00:17:21,300 --> 00:17:22,610
What's that?

266
00:17:24,740 --> 00:17:25,660
You...

267
00:17:25,660 --> 00:17:26,850
Just looking around.

268
00:17:27,180 --> 00:17:28,300
Please have a look.

269
00:17:30,860 --> 00:17:32,580
Luckily it's just a location tracker.

270
00:17:32,980 --> 00:17:35,700
If this is a voice listening device, we're done for.

271
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:38,460
He's following me?

272
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:39,820
Just you alone?

273
00:17:40,300 --> 00:17:42,300
The clinic is small, so it's just me alone.

274
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:43,820
Just selling medicine?

275
00:17:45,340 --> 00:17:46,220
This...

276
00:17:46,460 --> 00:17:48,460
not only sells medicine, can examine patients too.

277
00:17:48,620 --> 00:17:50,300
Above is the clinic.

278
00:17:52,180 --> 00:17:53,700
Would you like to look up?

279
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:55,660
Let me accompany you.

280
00:18:05,860 --> 00:18:06,660
Go fast, go fast.

281
00:18:08,380 --> 00:18:09,100
No, no.

282
00:18:09,540 --> 00:18:10,660
My electric motorbike is below.

283
00:18:11,020 --> 00:18:12,340
If I go, I'll be found out.

284
00:18:13,780 --> 00:18:14,940
There's no time left, hurry up and leave.

285
00:18:15,420 --> 00:18:16,180
Captain Xiao, you go quickly.

286
00:18:16,180 --> 00:18:17,020
I have a way.

287
00:18:17,660 --> 00:18:18,820
- Then you be careful. - Good.

288
00:18:18,820 --> 00:18:19,540
Must be careful.

289
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:20,540
I know.

290
00:18:22,500 --> 00:18:23,340
Hurry up.

291
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:47,540
Boss, can you change something else, no?

292
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,020
I'm tired of seeing it.

293
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,020
Bos?

294
00:18:59,540 --> 00:19:00,020
no,

295
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:01,060
why did you come here?

296
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:09,660
What's wrong with you?

297
00:19:09,660 --> 00:19:10,860
Why just barge in?

298
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,220
Why did you come in here?

299
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:14,220
You... you're disturbing my patient, understand?

300
00:19:14,260 --> 00:19:15,500
Mr. Meng, don't panic, yes.

301
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,500
Continue the relaxation.

302
00:19:16,500 --> 00:19:17,500
- What's the relaxation? - Meditate.

303
00:19:17,500 --> 00:19:18,500
Close your eyes and meditate.

304
00:19:18,500 --> 00:19:19,500
- What meditation? - You're...

305
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:20,260
hurry and go right now.

306
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,700
Otherwise, I will report to the police!

307
00:19:21,700 --> 00:19:22,900
Report it to the police?

308
00:19:23,740 --> 00:19:24,860
This is my boss.

309
00:19:25,420 --> 00:19:26,340
No, no, he...

310
00:19:26,660 --> 00:19:27,340
That's okay.

311
00:19:27,340 --> 00:19:27,940
You continue with your work.

312
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:28,740
You continue with your work.

313
00:19:29,020 --> 00:19:29,500
no,

314
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,700
he's bothering you, understand?

315
00:19:30,700 --> 00:19:31,460
It's okay, it's okay, it's okay.

316
00:19:31,460 --> 00:19:32,660
No, don't disturb the patient!

317
00:19:32,660 --> 00:19:33,500
Hurry up!

318
00:19:36,500 --> 00:19:37,660
What are you doing here?

319
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:41,020
I... I changed the bandage.

320
00:20:01,260 --> 00:20:01,940
Bos,

321
00:20:02,740 --> 00:20:03,860
how about like this?

322
00:20:04,260 --> 00:20:05,220
We...

323
00:20:05,460 --> 00:20:05,980
What if

324
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,500
shall we talk somewhere else?

325
00:20:15,260 --> 00:20:15,980
This side.

326
00:20:27,500 --> 00:20:28,460
Are you ready to go?

327
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:29,740
Of.

328
00:20:30,660 --> 00:20:31,500
Wait.

329
00:20:31,740 --> 00:20:32,900
Bring the medicine.

330
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:35,020
What other medicine?

331
00:20:35,020 --> 00:20:36,700
I... my wound has even become a scab.

332
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:37,500
Come on, come on, come on.

333
00:20:38,020 --> 00:20:39,820
I've prescribed the medicine.

334
00:20:39,820 --> 00:20:42,500
This... if you don't take it, who will pay the money?

335
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:44,020
I even gave you a discount.

336
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:44,860
Nine hundred and twenty eight yuan,

337
00:20:44,860 --> 00:20:45,700
30 percent discount,

338
00:20:45,700 --> 00:20:46,660
so 700 yuan.

339
00:20:48,100 --> 00:20:48,500
Nope.

340
00:20:48,500 --> 00:20:48,900
No, no.

341
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:49,820
Wait, Mr. Feng.

342
00:20:50,340 --> 00:20:51,260
Wait.

343
00:20:51,820 --> 00:20:52,940
You're blackmailing people, right?

344
00:20:53,500 --> 00:20:54,980
Since when is my discount not 40 percent?

345
00:20:55,220 --> 00:20:57,180
I'm a VIP client here, understand?

346
00:20:57,180 --> 00:20:57,940
Try looking at the notes.

347
00:20:57,940 --> 00:20:59,700
Since when is the price for me not 556.8 yuan?

348
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:03,180
Truly.

349
00:21:03,740 --> 00:21:05,020
I'm forgetful.

350
00:21:05,700 --> 00:21:07,940
You... you're an old customer, right?

351
00:21:08,260 --> 00:21:09,500
That's right, 40 percent.

352
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:10,740
VIP.

353
00:21:11,020 --> 00:21:13,380
Five hundred fifty six point eight yuan.

354
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:14,220
Correct.

355
00:21:14,220 --> 00:21:15,500
That's right, give me the money.

356
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:16,660
How ridiculous.

357
00:21:19,180 --> 00:21:22,020
Five hundred fifty six point eight yuan.

358
00:21:23,380 --> 00:21:24,220
Count, yes.

359
00:21:24,340 --> 00:21:25,340
OK, OK.

360
00:21:25,500 --> 00:21:25,980
Okay.

361
00:21:26,820 --> 00:21:27,500
I go.

362
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:28,460
Fine.

363
00:21:30,020 --> 00:21:32,180
If it still doesn't work, I'll destroy your shop.

364
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:36,020
Sick people don't be so angry.

365
00:21:36,900 --> 00:21:38,380
If there is any disease, check carefully.

366
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:40,500
So fussy.

367
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:42,820
Next time come again, yes.

368
00:21:52,020 --> 00:21:52,980
Bos,

369
00:21:53,740 --> 00:21:55,460
actually how did you find this place?

370
00:21:57,180 --> 00:21:59,020
You can't be following me, right?

371
00:22:00,220 --> 00:22:01,020
What are you sick with?

372
00:22:04,700 --> 00:22:05,700
There isn't any.

373
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:10,140
Pain is nothing to be ashamed of,

374
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:13,020
but never seek treatment in a dark clinic like this.

375
00:22:13,260 --> 00:22:14,500
Don't harm yourself.

376
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:17,660
A few more days,

377
00:22:18,500 --> 00:22:19,980
I will take you to the right place.

378
00:22:19,980 --> 00:22:20,620
No need.

379
00:22:23,020 --> 00:22:25,260
Then, don't eat your medicine again.

380
00:22:26,500 --> 00:22:28,260
It's hundreds of yuan.

381
00:22:28,340 --> 00:22:29,500
Don't throw it away.

382
00:22:31,740 --> 00:22:32,940
When did it start?

383
00:22:41,860 --> 00:22:42,420
Sis,

384
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,660
are you really...

385
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:47,820
following me?

386
00:22:57,020 --> 00:22:57,740
Okay.

387
00:22:58,460 --> 00:22:59,500
Not very exciting.

388
00:23:00,580 --> 00:23:01,900
If you don't trust me so much,

389
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,460
I'll go, no problem.

390
00:23:04,620 --> 00:23:06,500
Is it true that I can't work anywhere else?

391
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:10,020
Don't do useless things like this.

392
00:23:10,700 --> 00:23:12,020
If this gets out,

393
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:13,900
it's not just our brotherhood that will be damaged,

394
00:23:13,900 --> 00:23:15,700
but I will also be laughed at by many people.

395
00:23:20,420 --> 00:23:21,140
Sis,

396
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,940
I call you "Sis",

397
00:23:24,460 --> 00:23:26,500
Thank you for your kindness to me all this time.

398
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,820
this car,

399
00:23:31,260 --> 00:23:32,220
I can't accept it.

400
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,020
this key,

401
00:23:34,700 --> 00:23:35,620
I'll return it to you.

402
00:23:41,980 --> 00:23:42,660
This.

403
00:23:47,580 --> 00:23:48,620
Thank you, Sis.

404
00:23:55,180 --> 00:23:56,740
I was once betrayed by my brother.

405
00:23:57,580 --> 00:23:58,540
My life almost disappeared.

406
00:23:59,940 --> 00:24:01,020
Now consider others as brothers again,

407
00:24:01,820 --> 00:24:03,140
Of course I will be more alert.

408
00:24:07,700 --> 00:24:08,660
We'll talk elsewhere.

409
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,740
There's serious business.

410
00:24:28,260 --> 00:24:28,940
Sis Ke,

411
00:24:29,340 --> 00:24:30,220
This

412
00:24:30,660 --> 00:24:32,020
is Mr. Wang from our company,

413
00:24:32,020 --> 00:24:33,180
Wang Changjun,

414
00:24:33,740 --> 00:24:35,220
CEO of the company.

415
00:24:35,660 --> 00:24:37,460
Cambridge University graduate.

416
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:38,940
Wait, An.

417
00:24:39,620 --> 00:24:42,420
We're just chatting together, can you not be so formal?

418
00:24:42,900 --> 00:24:44,300
If I wanted to know something like this,

419
00:24:44,660 --> 00:24:46,140
can't I just see it on the company website?

420
00:24:46,140 --> 00:24:47,180
Do I need to ask you?

421
00:24:49,900 --> 00:24:50,340
This...

422
00:24:51,380 --> 00:24:52,540
Just calm down.

423
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,380
The contents of the conversation between the two of us,

424
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:57,060
I definitely won't tell anyone.

425
00:24:57,060 --> 00:24:58,820
Even though the chairman of the board of directors asked me,

426
00:24:58,820 --> 00:24:59,780
I will also close my mouth tightly.

427
00:24:59,780 --> 00:25:00,540
I swear.

428
00:25:03,300 --> 00:25:04,100
Of?

429
00:25:04,900 --> 00:25:07,100
Tell me a little gossip that outsiders don't know.

430
00:25:12,580 --> 00:25:13,260
Okay,

431
00:25:13,620 --> 00:25:15,140
If so, I'll tell you a little gossip.

432
00:25:16,900 --> 00:25:18,660
Mr. Wang from our company,

433
00:25:18,780 --> 00:25:20,940
the type who hides a knife behind his smile.

434
00:25:21,140 --> 00:25:22,620
If he wants to kill someone,

435
00:25:22,620 --> 00:25:24,180
will have no mercy at all.

436
00:25:24,500 --> 00:25:26,780
The person I fear most in the company is him.

437
00:25:30,420 --> 00:25:32,860
Ini Yuan Fenfang,

438
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:34,740
company financial supervisor.

439
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:37,260
That day I said,

440
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:38,460
this person,

441
00:25:38,460 --> 00:25:40,020
his temperament was a bit strange.

442
00:25:40,180 --> 00:25:41,620
All day his face was sullen.

443
00:25:41,860 --> 00:25:42,580
Meet anyone,

444
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:44,260
as if they owed him eight million yuan.

445
00:25:44,940 --> 00:25:46,940
You praise him for being good at bookkeeping, right?

446
00:25:47,740 --> 00:25:48,820
Actually,

447
00:25:48,820 --> 00:25:50,180
You are praising the wrong person.

448
00:25:50,620 --> 00:25:52,420
He's actually not that competent.

449
00:25:52,700 --> 00:25:54,420
He always relied on his subordinates.

450
00:25:54,620 --> 00:25:55,420
However,

451
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:58,540
he is very loyal to the company.

452
00:25:59,180 --> 00:26:00,140
I heard,

453
00:26:00,380 --> 00:26:04,580
The chairman of the board of directors' father himself gave him this position.

454
00:26:04,580 --> 00:26:05,820
He is his confidant.

455
00:26:08,860 --> 00:26:10,180
His name is also the financial supervisor,

456
00:26:10,180 --> 00:26:13,060
definitely have to gain the trust of the biggest boss.

457
00:26:17,820 --> 00:26:18,860
This person...

458
00:26:19,900 --> 00:26:20,980
who's he?

459
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:23,740
Why have I never seen him in the office?

460
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:29,100
He is Lawyer Yang, the company's legal advisor.

461
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:31,380
He also rarely comes to the office,

462
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:32,700
I rarely interact with him.

463
00:26:33,260 --> 00:26:35,300
He's Big Boss Feng's personal follower.

464
00:26:35,980 --> 00:26:37,260
I'm telling you, yeah.

465
00:26:37,260 --> 00:26:41,140
Even the chairman of the board of directors was very reluctant when he met him.

466
00:26:43,940 --> 00:26:48,220
This is the person in charge of the Aoxin new energy car project, Mr. Xu, right?

467
00:26:49,700 --> 00:26:51,140
That's right, he's the one.

468
00:26:53,140 --> 00:26:54,180
Sis Ke,

469
00:26:55,260 --> 00:26:57,580
Don't look at his ordinary looks,

470
00:26:58,420 --> 00:27:01,060
but his wife was very beautiful.

471
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:05,980
Sis Ke,

472
00:27:06,500 --> 00:27:07,980
I'll take the call first, okay?

473
00:27:08,540 --> 00:27:09,420
Let's just go together.

474
00:27:09,420 --> 00:27:10,780
I want to see the transaction journal in the meeting room.

475
00:27:15,020 --> 00:27:15,780
An.

476
00:27:17,700 --> 00:27:20,500
Gang, what did he do wrong to the chairman of the board of directors?

477
00:27:24,380 --> 00:27:25,860
Actually, I'm surprised too.

478
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:27,940
However, if you think about it, it's normal.

479
00:27:28,100 --> 00:27:29,700
That person is so stupid.

480
00:27:29,700 --> 00:27:31,700
His brain wasn't working at all.

481
00:27:33,660 --> 00:27:35,020
Isn't it just a matter of getting fired?

482
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:36,140
Why keep him?

483
00:27:38,500 --> 00:27:39,500
Gang

484
00:27:40,660 --> 00:27:42,140
different from other people.

485
00:27:44,300 --> 00:27:46,380
He has an older brother named Hai,

486
00:27:46,500 --> 00:27:48,020
following the chairman of the board of directors for many years.

487
00:27:48,860 --> 00:27:50,380
He is the driver and personal bodyguard.

488
00:27:50,780 --> 00:27:52,660
The chairman of the board of directors really trusted him.

489
00:27:55,900 --> 00:28:00,700
Now, even though he is gone, his services remain.

490
00:28:08,500 --> 00:28:10,100
You go first, we'll chat again later.

491
00:28:10,100 --> 00:28:11,140
Good.

492
00:28:20,780 --> 00:28:21,700
Smuggling?

493
00:28:22,820 --> 00:28:24,420
You're telling me to join Brother Qiang in smuggling?

494
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,220
Boss, that's illegal.

495
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:30,540
If caught, you will go to prison.

496
00:28:30,980 --> 00:28:32,780
This isn't the first time you've done something illegal either.

497
00:28:33,020 --> 00:28:34,420
This is a different kind.

498
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:35,900
What I did before was nothing.

499
00:28:36,820 --> 00:28:37,780
Why? Afraid?

500
00:28:39,620 --> 00:28:40,420
What is smuggled?

501
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:41,620
Not know.

502
00:28:41,620 --> 00:28:43,060
I asked you to go there to find out

503
00:28:43,060 --> 00:28:45,180
what is smuggled and who is it smuggled through?

504
00:28:46,140 --> 00:28:48,500
So, you asked us to go there even though you weren't clear yet?

505
00:28:49,340 --> 00:28:50,500
What if it's drugs?

506
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,380
Smuggling drugs is punishable by death.

507
00:28:53,380 --> 00:28:54,540
I'm not satisfied with life yet.

508
00:28:54,780 --> 00:28:55,660
I don't want to.

509
00:28:56,180 --> 00:28:58,060
If it is smuggled abroad, how could it be drugs?

510
00:28:58,420 --> 00:28:59,420
Just calm down.

511
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:00,780
Second uncle didn't have anything like that.

512
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:07,020
Have you thought about it?

513
00:29:07,300 --> 00:29:08,500
Dare or not?

514
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:14,500
Sis.

515
00:29:17,340 --> 00:29:19,780
How about you just tell Sis Qiang to do it?

516
00:29:19,980 --> 00:29:21,180
However, he had to go there too.

517
00:29:21,780 --> 00:29:22,980
You Qiang's guts weren't that big.

518
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,220
He was there to drive a car carrying contraband.

519
00:29:25,220 --> 00:29:27,100
He didn't dare do anything other than that.

520
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:35,220
OK, I'll do it.

521
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:40,460
Consider this time as my return to you.

522
00:29:42,020 --> 00:29:42,580
When you return later,

523
00:29:42,580 --> 00:29:45,220
We walk our separate paths, not bothering each other.

524
00:29:45,220 --> 00:29:46,620
Besides, you can't trust me either.

525
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:48,260
Before you suspected me of being a wiretap,

526
00:29:48,260 --> 00:29:49,340
then you also followed me.

527
00:29:49,500 --> 00:29:50,180
Later, we...

528
00:29:50,180 --> 00:29:51,420
Are you vengeful?

529
00:29:58,060 --> 00:29:58,940
Come back.

530
00:29:58,940 --> 00:29:59,740
Don't wander around these two days.

531
00:29:59,740 --> 00:30:02,420
Just follow You Qiang so he doesn't get suspicious.

532
00:30:30,900 --> 00:30:33,100
It's not that I like nagging you guys, okay?

533
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:35,740
I'm too lazy to nag you.

534
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:40,060
This problem is your own fault, right?

535
00:30:54,900 --> 00:30:55,900
Leng Tou,

536
00:30:56,860 --> 00:30:58,860
you're really great, yeah.

537
00:31:00,380 --> 00:31:02,060
Celebrating birthday.

538
00:31:08,340 --> 00:31:10,740
Do you know when you were born?

539
00:31:11,060 --> 00:31:12,420
Only managed to hook one girl,

540
00:31:12,700 --> 00:31:14,980
then want to show off in front of everyone, right?

541
00:31:19,700 --> 00:31:21,020
In the end what?

542
00:31:26,380 --> 00:31:27,420
How?

543
00:31:28,780 --> 00:31:30,300
Ma... enter the police station.

544
00:31:31,500 --> 00:31:32,180
Of.

545
00:31:34,500 --> 00:31:35,500
Look at it.

546
00:31:38,780 --> 00:31:40,380
Even there still...

547
00:31:40,900 --> 00:31:42,340
still matching clothes.

548
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:47,500
How many affairs are pending!

549
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:51,100
Almost even dragged me in!

550
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,020
I'm telling you,

551
00:31:54,500 --> 00:31:56,300
I I...

552
00:31:56,700 --> 00:31:57,700
I I...

553
00:31:58,340 --> 00:31:59,460
Kak Qiang, Kak Qiang, Kak Qiang.

554
00:32:00,220 --> 00:32:01,380
Calm yourself, calm yourself.

555
00:32:01,900 --> 00:32:04,580
I think they can get out safely,

556
00:32:04,580 --> 00:32:05,620
that's already good.

557
00:32:06,580 --> 00:32:07,460
Get out of there!

558
00:32:10,100 --> 00:32:11,740
You're just as troublesome.

559
00:32:13,580 --> 00:32:15,140
(Wu)

560
00:32:22,820 --> 00:32:23,700
Wu?

561
00:32:24,780 --> 00:32:26,300
Wu, where are you?

562
00:32:26,300 --> 00:32:27,060
Halo, Rade, River.

563
00:32:27,700 --> 00:32:28,780
I'm under the club.

564
00:32:28,780 --> 00:32:29,820
I was beaten by people.

565
00:32:30,860 --> 00:32:31,420
Halo?

566
00:32:31,940 --> 00:32:32,340
Fast!

567
00:32:32,340 --> 00:32:32,980
Follow me!

568
00:32:33,380 --> 00:32:34,340
Come on, come on!

569
00:32:34,340 --> 00:32:35,020
Hajar!

570
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:40,460
Who beat Wu?

571
00:33:19,180 --> 00:33:20,580
What have you been up to lately?

572
00:33:20,660 --> 00:33:21,860
Where have you been?

573
00:33:21,860 --> 00:33:23,860
This is my clothes that I just bought, quite expensive.

574
00:33:24,940 --> 00:33:26,020
Branded too.

575
00:33:26,020 --> 00:33:26,940
Next time I'll buy a set too.

576
00:33:27,180 --> 00:33:27,860
Kak Qiang.

577
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:31,900
Kak Qiang.

578
00:33:33,820 --> 00:33:35,180
What a stupid kid.

579
00:33:35,340 --> 00:33:36,820
I almost died from panic!

580
00:33:37,220 --> 00:33:37,820
I'm fine.

581
00:33:39,340 --> 00:33:40,020
Wu,

582
00:33:40,620 --> 00:33:43,220
is this Mr. Feng's new car?

583
00:33:44,060 --> 00:33:44,940
Kak Qiang.

584
00:33:45,740 --> 00:33:46,940
This is a sign of my devotion to you.

585
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:49,380
Listen, no?

586
00:33:49,380 --> 00:33:50,620
Sign of devotion, sign of devotion.

587
00:33:51,420 --> 00:33:52,540
Where did you get this much money?

588
00:33:52,540 --> 00:33:53,940
You don't have to turn it around.

589
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:56,140
Do not steal, rob or break the law.

590
00:33:56,540 --> 00:33:57,940
This car is very nice.

591
00:33:57,940 --> 00:33:59,140
You just use it calmly.

592
00:33:59,540 --> 00:34:00,420
Am I using it?

593
00:34:00,740 --> 00:34:01,500
You use it.

594
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:05,340
Kak Qiang,

595
00:34:06,780 --> 00:34:08,060
Master Feng gave it to me.

596
00:34:08,420 --> 00:34:09,420
I don't need it.

597
00:34:10,020 --> 00:34:10,980
You just use it.

598
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:13,580
Daily shuttle Qiang Qiang to school,

599
00:34:13,580 --> 00:34:14,820
it also becomes more prestigious, right?

600
00:34:16,860 --> 00:34:18,820
I... can't, can't.

601
00:34:18,820 --> 00:34:19,780
Sis.

602
00:34:20,060 --> 00:34:21,340
Anyway, you can.

603
00:34:21,820 --> 00:34:23,730
Without you, there would be no me now.

604
00:34:26,140 --> 00:34:27,250
However, Mr. Feng...

605
00:34:27,250 --> 00:34:28,170
That's okay.

606
00:34:28,540 --> 00:34:29,690
He already gave it to me.

607
00:34:30,170 --> 00:34:32,140
It's none of my business who I want to give this car to.

608
00:34:32,940 --> 00:34:34,340
This is a little goodwill from your sister.

609
00:34:35,380 --> 00:34:36,620
Accept it.

610
00:34:43,820 --> 00:34:45,100
Little boy.

611
00:34:48,980 --> 00:34:49,690
Okay.

612
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:51,650
If that's the case, I'll use it first.

613
00:34:51,860 --> 00:34:53,730
Whenever you want to wear it, just tell me, okay?

614
00:34:53,900 --> 00:34:54,460
Good.

615
00:34:58,900 --> 00:34:59,580
Leng Tou.

616
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:00,940
What are you doing?

617
00:35:01,100 --> 00:35:02,580
I only touched it briefly.

618
00:35:03,100 --> 00:35:04,700
Is this a car you can touch as you please?

619
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:07,980
Is this a car you can touch as you please?

620
00:35:07,980 --> 00:35:09,140
Don't move.

621
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:10,140
Yes, right?

622
00:35:10,220 --> 00:35:10,780
I beat you.

623
00:35:11,340 --> 00:35:12,020
Stop it.

624
00:35:12,020 --> 00:35:12,740
Kak Qiang,

625
00:35:12,740 --> 00:35:13,660
that's it, that's it

626
00:35:13,780 --> 00:35:16,980
We've worked hard all year, right?

627
00:35:17,260 --> 00:35:17,500
Of.

628
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:18,580
Dirty and tiring work like this,

629
00:35:19,220 --> 00:35:20,140
just leave it to the three of us.

630
00:35:20,380 --> 00:35:21,180
Beat him!

631
00:36:18,860 --> 00:36:19,620
How?

632
00:36:20,100 --> 00:36:21,460
Are there any new discoveries?

633
00:36:23,500 --> 00:36:24,100
Ada.

634
00:36:30,740 --> 00:36:33,300
This is a report from Aoxin new energy automobile factory.

635
00:36:33,460 --> 00:36:35,100
Take a look at labor costs here.

636
00:36:39,060 --> 00:36:41,740
Although calculated based on the average employee's income

637
00:36:41,740 --> 00:36:42,940
throughout the province last year,

638
00:36:45,020 --> 00:36:48,300
This labor cost is only enough to pay the wages of 200 people.

639
00:36:49,260 --> 00:36:52,380
For giant factories with investments of hundreds of billions of yuan,

640
00:36:52,780 --> 00:36:53,860
with this few people...

641
00:36:55,420 --> 00:36:56,140
is that possible?

642
00:37:04,580 --> 00:37:05,820
You mean,

643
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:07,220
this project commits forgery?

644
00:37:16,820 --> 00:37:18,220
Take a look at the part I circled.

645
00:37:22,380 --> 00:37:23,500
Just on this page,

646
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:25,620
26 and 28,

647
00:37:25,620 --> 00:37:28,020
these numbers appear repeatedly following a certain pattern.

648
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:30,540
What does that mean?

649
00:37:32,140 --> 00:37:35,300
This is caused by psychological factors when someone manipulates data.

650
00:37:43,580 --> 00:37:44,580
Manipulating data?

651
00:37:48,460 --> 00:37:49,380
This means...

652
00:37:51,300 --> 00:37:52,380
false report?

653
00:37:54,620 --> 00:37:55,980
If there is no other coincidence,

654
00:37:56,100 --> 00:37:57,020
Correct.

655
00:38:06,580 --> 00:38:08,540
If that's the case, tomorrow I'll ask them for a list of employees.

656
00:38:13,380 --> 00:38:14,820
Pre-sales of new cars are about to start.

657
00:38:16,220 --> 00:38:17,580
You go straight to the factory

658
00:38:18,140 --> 00:38:20,580
and holding large employee mobilization meetings,

659
00:38:20,580 --> 00:38:21,780
wouldn't it be better?

660
00:38:26,420 --> 00:38:27,700
That's also a good way.

661
00:38:30,820 --> 00:38:32,060
Good way?

662
00:38:33,540 --> 00:38:34,980
If we do like this,

663
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,460
we will make the enemy alert.

664
00:38:36,460 --> 00:38:37,900
Take you to the company to check the books,

665
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,580
has made the enemy alert.

666
00:38:39,580 --> 00:38:40,380
Correct,

667
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:43,300
but they weren't sure what I could actually find.

668
00:38:45,580 --> 00:38:47,380
Maybe they really trusted Yuan Fenfang

669
00:38:47,380 --> 00:38:49,700
and thought the bookkeeping he made would be perfect without any gaps.

670
00:38:50,980 --> 00:38:52,740
Maybe he also feels, I'm just pretending,

671
00:38:53,020 --> 00:38:55,460
at best it just fools you, unable to find anything at all.

672
00:38:56,580 --> 00:38:57,780
Then, what do you want?

673
00:39:01,820 --> 00:39:03,540
I have one assumption,

674
00:39:04,700 --> 00:39:06,420
but I need time to confirm it.

675
00:39:14,300 --> 00:39:14,860
Oh yes,

676
00:39:14,900 --> 00:39:15,900
where is your lackey?

677
00:39:16,220 --> 00:39:17,500
I haven't seen him for days.

678
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:19,300
Secretly making trouble again?

679
00:39:23,540 --> 00:39:26,300
You have stabbed his hand, you have vented your anger.

680
00:39:27,300 --> 00:39:28,580
Don't be endless.

681
00:39:30,900 --> 00:39:32,620
Can't I worry about it?

682
00:39:35,820 --> 00:39:37,780
Why don't you worry about me?

683
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:42,140
Hold on to your bad thoughts first.

684
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:44,140
He is fine,

685
00:39:44,540 --> 00:39:45,820
his hand is about to heal.

686
00:39:47,780 --> 00:39:49,220
If so, that's a shame.

687
00:40:27,860 --> 00:40:28,460
Look, there's a car.

688
00:40:30,620 --> 00:40:31,580
What are they?

How about I call my friends first?

698
00:41:04,860 --> 00:41:05,900
I'm afraid that you won't be able to contact me,

699
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:07,220
they'll think something happened to me.

700

701
00:41:09,260 --> 00:41:10,580

who will look for you?

706
00:41:18,020 --> 00:41:19,300
Who will look for you? There isn't any.
