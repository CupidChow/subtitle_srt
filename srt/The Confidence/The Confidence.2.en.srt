=Episode 2=

3
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:34,970
There are people donating money to the campus to build buildings,

4
00:01:34,970 --> 00:01:36,560
today all the leaders came.

5
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,050
Stop it.

6
00:01:39,130 --> 00:01:39,970
I'll close first, okay?

7
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:41,370
My cellphone got hot.

8
00:01:42,130 --> 00:01:43,280
Take care of yourself.

9
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,010
Hello, Mrs. Ke.

10
00:01:46,330 --> 00:01:46,920
Halo.

11
00:01:47,480 --> 00:01:48,010
Good.

12
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:49,330
Just send it to my cell phone.

13
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,410
Excuse me,

14
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:04,330
How do I get to the dean's office?

15
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:06,370
Over there is the third floor.

16
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:14,410
The third floor?

17
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:22,970
Thank you, Mrs. Ke.

18
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:28,330
You're okay, right?

19
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:29,410
Don't come any closer, don't come any closer!

20
00:02:31,600 --> 00:02:32,210
Good.

21
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:33,240
I won't come any closer.

22
00:02:37,970 --> 00:02:38,770
Mr. Feng.

23
00:02:39,770 --> 00:02:40,440
Tuan Fe...

24
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,520
I'm Shen Yueming from the dean's office.

25
00:02:51,130 --> 00:02:51,690
Bu Ke?

26
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,490
What's wrong with you?

27
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:54,970
I'm fine.

28
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,570
It doesn't matter.

29
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,690
I'm really okay.

30
00:02:57,970 --> 00:02:58,850
That's good then.

31
00:02:59,490 --> 00:03:00,130
Mr. Feng,

32
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:00,800
I'm late coming out

33
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:01,570
didn't have time to pick you up.

34
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,720
Please.

35
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:05,520
Please too.

36
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:13,850
Mr. Feng,

37
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:14,970
there's a telephone.

38
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,170
Ying Ying.

39
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:27,170
Why did your foot suddenly sprain?

40
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,610
Here, let me see.

41
00:04:32,480 --> 00:04:33,130
Can it move?

42
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:38,040
The bones should be okay,

43
00:04:38,570 --> 00:04:39,890
but don't move this ice bag.

44
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:41,320
I carry the spray in my bag,

45
00:04:41,410 --> 00:04:42,610
try using it for a few days.

46
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,450
Surface.

47
00:04:52,010 --> 00:04:53,570
Aku melihat Shen Shijie.

48
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:55,450
Really.

49
00:04:56,690 --> 00:04:57,850
I've actually seen it.

50
00:04:58,010 --> 00:04:59,080
He is on our campus.

51
00:05:00,010 --> 00:05:01,730
He donated a building to our campus.

52
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:10,800
Shen Shijie donated a building to your campus?

53
00:05:10,920 --> 00:05:12,570
Now he goes by a nickname,

54
00:05:13,290 --> 00:05:14,450
Namanya Feng Xiaosheng.

55
00:05:21,010 --> 00:05:21,730
Ying Ying,

56
00:05:23,610 --> 00:05:25,610
Have you been sleeping lately?

57
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,010
still not sleeping?

58
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:33,450
Don't think nonsense,

59
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,200
think I have a mental disorder.

60
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,080
I... I really saw it.

61
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,970
I know.

62
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:39,850
I certainly wouldn't think so

63
00:05:39,850 --> 00:05:41,130
that you have a mental disorder.

64
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,410
However, Ying Ying, we also know,

65
00:05:44,450 --> 00:05:46,760
Shen Shijie sudah mati.

66
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:49,290
He was completely dead.

67
00:05:56,320 --> 00:05:56,760
Recently,

68
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,610
representatives of superior entrepreneurs in our city,

69
00:05:58,610 --> 00:06:00,450
chairman of the board of directors of Feng-Fuyong Holding Company,

70
00:06:00,450 --> 00:06:02,360
Tuan Feng Xiaosheng,

71
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:03,610
representing the Feng Group,

72
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:05,450
menyumbang Gedung Zhenzhi Universitas Nanzhou

73
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:07,080
and education funds of 50 million yuan,

74
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,640
to help with research

75
00:06:08,640 --> 00:06:09,920
new energy of Nanzhou University.

76
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:11,170
After the donation ceremony,

77
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:11,890
Feng Xiaosheng

78
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:13,570
and the students of Nanzhou University

79
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:14,690
hold discussions.

80
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:16,080
You don't know, right?

81
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:17,690
He went to Europe not for a review,

82
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:18,640
but rather go for treatment.

83
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,520
Isn't it in discussion?

84
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,890
Have any students asked about it?

85
00:06:21,010 --> 00:06:22,690
He already gave an immediate response,

86
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:24,320
just a review.

87
00:06:24,730 --> 00:06:26,320
Where is there a review that takes seven months?

88
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:27,450
Previously when

89
00:06:27,450 --> 00:06:28,170
Aoxin car press conference,

90
00:06:28,170 --> 00:06:29,320
his face already looked pale.

91
00:06:29,480 --> 00:06:30,890
It can be seen from the live broadcast.

92
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:32,200
This time he was

93
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:33,450
looks much better,

94
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:34,610
his body is also fit.

95
00:06:35,850 --> 00:06:37,520
In essence, the look on someone's face

96
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:38,890
it can be seen with the naked eye.

97
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:40,450
Facial expressions improve,

98
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:41,760
the person also looks radiant.

99
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:44,610
OK, I want to go teach.

100
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:46,080
Go away.

101
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:21,000
(Feng Conglomerate Holding Company)

102
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:50,000
(Office of the Chairman of the Board of Directors)

103
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:17,040
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

104
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:18,890
Thank You.

105
00:08:20,010 --> 00:08:23,320
Now all the furniture has been replaced with new ones according to your request.

106
00:08:23,320 --> 00:08:24,410
Are you satisfied?

107
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:26,240
Very satisfied.

108
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:29,010
Today's schedule

109
00:08:29,010 --> 00:08:30,010
arranged like this.

110
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:30,800
Is there a meeting?

111
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:32,760
There are three meetings.

112
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,560
First meeting...

113
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:34,810
Do I have to attend everything?

114
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:36,410
If not mandatory,

115
00:08:36,410 --> 00:08:37,490
help me reject everything.

116
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:39,170
So,

117
00:08:39,410 --> 00:08:40,200
give me all

118
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,170
company financial reports

119
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:42,050
for the last three years.

120
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:44,320
Good.

121
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:51,560
Is there anything else?

122
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:53,440
There isn't any,

123
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,250
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

124
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:55,640
Call me if you need.

125
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:20,560
(Meeting room) OK, that's it.

126
00:09:20,730 --> 00:09:21,410
Recently.

127
00:09:24,410 --> 00:09:25,050
Tongbin,

128
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:26,410
and also Chen.

129
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:32,760
The city-level leader asked again

130
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:34,320
about murder cases 1-28.

131
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:38,290
What is the actual situation on your side?

132
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:43,370
Bureau Chief Liu,

133
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,760
the suspects in the 1-28 murder case, Shen Shijie, Wu Yajun and friends,

134
00:09:46,760 --> 00:09:47,760
even though they are dead,

135
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:49,440
but there are still many situations

136
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:50,320
that we don't know yet.

137
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:52,320
So, we still have to wait.

138
00:09:53,080 --> 00:09:53,970
Give me a time limit.

139
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:02,410
OK, OK.

140
00:10:03,370 --> 00:10:04,850
I won't force you,

141
00:10:05,290 --> 00:10:06,080
also does not determine

142
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:06,850
time limit for you.

143
00:10:06,970 --> 00:10:07,810
However...

144
00:10:08,810 --> 00:10:09,610
However,

145
00:10:11,050 --> 00:10:12,000
you have to remember.

146
00:10:12,290 --> 00:10:14,050
Every time a city-level leader questions me,

147
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:16,850
I will punish you again.

148
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:17,730
Good.

149
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:19,170
Please punish as much as you like.

150
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:22,930
Be careful, Bureau Chief Liu.

151
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:27,370
Stop!

152
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:31,250
sister,

153
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:32,850
touch your conscience and think,

154
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:35,200
How many times have I been your scapegoat?

155
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:36,730
Why should I?

156
00:10:36,730 --> 00:10:38,320
You're younger than me.

157
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:40,290
You talk better than me.

158
00:10:40,850 --> 00:10:42,560
You are also my boss.

159
00:10:42,930 --> 00:10:43,560
Oh yes.

160
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:45,810
Am I included

161
00:10:45,810 --> 00:10:47,120
save your life?

162
00:10:50,490 --> 00:10:52,320
OK, I admit it.

163
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:54,290
You are my life saver.

164
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:56,250
However, I want to ask you.

165
00:10:56,320 --> 00:10:57,850
Kasus Shen Shijie,

166
00:10:57,850 --> 00:10:59,730
you want to check it out until

167
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:00,850
to what extent are you satisfied?

168
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:03,290
Look at your attitude,

169
00:11:03,290 --> 00:11:04,850
watch your attitude.

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,170
Shouldn't I confirm the chain of evidence?

171
00:11:18,410 --> 00:11:21,850
Especially the roots in the ground, I have to dig them out.

172
00:11:21,850 --> 00:11:23,730
I already know what you want to say.

173
00:11:24,730 --> 00:11:26,000
Kau mau bilang Shen Shijie

174
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:27,250
killed the victim in cases 1-28,

175
00:11:27,250 --> 00:11:28,850
he had no motive for the murder.

176
00:11:29,410 --> 00:11:31,440
The argument that day was just an excuse.

177
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,610
There must be a mastermind behind this, right?

178
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,850
However, what was Shen Shijie like?

179
00:11:37,080 --> 00:11:38,490
He's a criminal

180
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:39,610
which cannot be forgiven.

181
00:11:39,850 --> 00:11:40,850
He even had the heart to kill

182
00:11:40,850 --> 00:11:41,680
his own subordinates.

183
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:42,850
People like him,

184
00:11:42,850 --> 00:11:44,610
does he need a motive to kill people?

185
00:11:44,730 --> 00:11:45,850
No, no.

186
00:11:45,970 --> 00:11:46,490
Just think about it

187
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:48,290
victims of 1-28 cases, Ma Bin,

188
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:49,000
who is he

189
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:51,560
He was the mortal enemy of the Feng brothers.

190
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:54,810
From nothing to a conglomerate,

191
00:11:54,810 --> 00:11:56,850
they always want to kill the opponent.

192
00:11:58,080 --> 00:11:58,970
Why can it be so coincidental?

193
00:12:00,080 --> 00:12:01,290
At the banquet,

194
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,120
accidentally killed by Shen Shijie?

195
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,490
This story is too far fetched.

196
00:12:06,610 --> 00:12:07,410
So,

197
00:12:07,810 --> 00:12:09,170
after Shen Shijie killed him,

198
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:11,490
he has run away.

199
00:12:11,850 --> 00:12:12,610
After more than a month,

200
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:14,440
why did he return to Nanzhou?

201
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:16,000
Taking a risk this big,

202
00:12:16,170 --> 00:12:16,850
What is the reason?

203
00:12:18,250 --> 00:12:19,730
Not only did Shen Shijie return,

204
00:12:19,850 --> 00:12:20,410
but it also appears

205
00:12:20,410 --> 00:12:21,730
a mysterious informant.

206
00:12:23,050 --> 00:12:24,170
This guy doesn't just know

207
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:25,200
Dia kembali ke Nanzhou,

208
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:26,760
but also know the hiding place.

209
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,930
However, who is this person?

210
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:31,640
Any more?

211
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:33,000
Shen Shijie is this person

212
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:35,410
cruel and merciless.

213
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:37,120
Its counter-sensing ability is very strong.

214
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:38,410
So, before that,

215
00:12:38,760 --> 00:12:40,370
we don't have his fingerprints,

216
00:12:40,520 --> 00:12:42,050
I don't have any archives for it.

217
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:42,640
Moreover,

218
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:43,730
their DNA samples.

219
00:12:44,080 --> 00:12:45,560
Why not long before?

220
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,760
he fell off the cliff,

221
00:12:46,760 --> 00:12:48,610
all this data is immediately available?

222
00:12:48,730 --> 00:12:50,760
Is this not something to be suspicious of?

223
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:52,370
Kapten Xiao,

224
00:12:52,370 --> 00:12:53,560
you understand me very well.

225
00:12:54,080 --> 00:12:55,370
I'm always like this.

226
00:12:55,560 --> 00:12:57,000
The more the durian falls,

227
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,560
the more I consider it a trap.

228
00:13:01,080 --> 00:13:01,930
Don't tell me now you

229
00:13:01,930 --> 00:13:03,290
also suspect that

230
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:04,760
Shen Shijie's corpse was a trap?

231
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,410
I just didn't say it.

232
00:13:09,970 --> 00:13:10,610
Okay.

233
00:13:11,170 --> 00:13:12,290
All your words are true.

234
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,050
It's just the problem,

235
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:17,370
now Deputy Governor Zhang has been questioned

236
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,320
and drag a number

237
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:20,640
officials and companies.

238
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,640
It seems that this time it's superior

239
00:13:22,640 --> 00:13:23,880
want to be serious.

240
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:26,440
It's a mess right now.

241
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:27,410
Can we

242
00:13:27,410 --> 00:13:28,410
do not add

243
00:13:28,410 --> 00:13:30,250
chaos in these chaotic times?

244
00:13:30,930 --> 00:13:31,640
Or,

245
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,000
can we talk about it another time?

246
00:13:34,200 --> 00:13:35,610
I think this is a good thing,

247
00:13:35,610 --> 00:13:36,320
Kapten Xiao.

248
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:37,730
This is an opportunity.

249
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,560
We all know clearly, who helped Shen Shijie

250
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:41,610
are the Feng brothers.

251
00:13:42,520 --> 00:13:43,850
As long as we have proof,

252
00:13:43,850 --> 00:13:46,000
then we can uncover everything.

253
00:13:46,640 --> 00:13:47,880
Like I said,

254
00:13:48,760 --> 00:13:50,970
time is truth's best friend.

255
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,120
Stop!

256
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:06,810
Please!

257
00:14:06,810 --> 00:14:07,320
Stop!

258
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:08,440
Stop!

259
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:10,410
Please!

260
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:11,080
Robbery!

261
00:14:11,170 --> 00:14:11,680
Stop!

262
00:14:12,200 --> 00:14:13,200
Stop!

263
00:14:13,290 --> 00:14:14,440
Police, help!

264
00:14:14,680 --> 00:14:15,440
After... after... after...

265
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,410
Go, go, go.

266
00:14:17,080 --> 00:14:17,850
Police!

267
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:18,730
I...

268
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:29,290
Don't move!

269
00:14:33,930 --> 00:14:34,250
Naik.

270
00:14:34,250 --> 00:14:34,970
Road!

271
00:14:38,930 --> 00:14:44,250
(Firmly Eradicate the Dangerous Mafia)

272
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,250
You said you didn't rob.

273
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:46,680
Look at the statement.

274
00:14:47,200 --> 00:14:48,200
Are you chasing him?

275
00:14:48,290 --> 00:14:49,170
Did you hit him?

276
00:14:49,370 --> 00:14:50,120
I chased him,

277
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:50,930
but didn't hit him.

278
00:15:00,760 --> 00:15:01,640
Go ahead.

279
00:15:01,970 --> 00:15:02,850
Mr Officer,

280
00:15:03,410 --> 00:15:04,930
I really didn't hit him.

281
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:05,760
I chased him

282
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:07,050
because at first I wanted to help him.

283
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:07,880
Really.

284
00:15:08,290 --> 00:15:08,850
Look at my looks

285
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:09,760
nor like a beater,

286
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:10,520
yes, right?

287
00:15:11,490 --> 00:15:12,440
Meng Hui,

288
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:13,250
Correct?

289
00:15:14,050 --> 00:15:14,970
Seems right.

290
00:15:15,250 --> 00:15:16,000
Correct.

291
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,320
Why just your own name?

292
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:18,520
don't you remember?

293
00:15:19,250 --> 00:15:21,810
This name is rarely used,

294
00:15:21,930 --> 00:15:23,290
so, easy to forget.

295
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,410
Usually they always call me Wu,

296
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:26,370
I am used to.

297
00:15:30,640 --> 00:15:31,320
Meng Hui,

298
00:15:31,320 --> 00:15:31,970
twenty six years old,

299
00:15:31,970 --> 00:15:33,250
Orang Tai'an, Shandong.

300
00:15:33,250 --> 00:15:34,200
Kidnapped and sold when he was five years old.

301
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:35,640
When he was 15 years old, he returned to his place of birth

302
00:15:35,640 --> 00:15:37,250
to find birth parents.

303
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:38,640
From 2007 to now,

304
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:39,520
used to be a security guard,

305
00:15:39,520 --> 00:15:40,560
restaurant chef assistant,

306
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:41,520
fitness trainer,

307
00:15:41,520 --> 00:15:42,520
project manager,

308
00:15:42,520 --> 00:15:43,440
used to sell used cars,

309
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:44,930
once sold a yacht,

310
00:15:45,200 --> 00:15:46,320
then deliver the food.

311
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:47,560
Seven months ago,

312
00:15:47,560 --> 00:15:48,880
meet You Qiang

313
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:50,440
and become his subordinates.

314
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:53,610
You're...

315
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:56,250
When I was little I didn't become evil,

316
00:15:56,640 --> 00:15:57,640
after adulthood,

317
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:00,200
why even take the wrong path?

318
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:04,170
Try telling me,

319
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:08,680
how can you blend in with

320
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:09,640
You Qiang?

321
00:16:10,170 --> 00:16:11,170
Mr Officer.

322
00:16:12,050 --> 00:16:14,370
You've looked into that much detail,

323
00:16:15,490 --> 00:16:16,640
so, you must know

324
00:16:16,640 --> 00:16:18,610
if I have to and there is no other way.

325
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,000
Forced?

326
00:16:23,080 --> 00:16:24,320
There's no other way?

327
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:26,320
No, I really don't have any other way.

328
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,320
There really is no other way.

329
00:16:33,170 --> 00:16:34,410
In reality,

330
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:36,290
This is also your fault, the police...

331
00:16:36,290 --> 00:16:37,320
who is too diligent.

332
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:39,880
Around February or March this year,

333
00:16:39,880 --> 00:16:40,970
the Complex Huyan,

334
00:16:41,490 --> 00:16:42,640
I am also a loyal friend,

335
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,000
help my friend collect money,

336
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:45,120
and want to scare them.

337
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:48,680
As a result, coincidentally, you guys, the police are raiding gambling

338
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:50,170
and check up to our place.

339
00:16:50,170 --> 00:16:51,810
Everyone was scared and panicked.

340
00:16:52,610 --> 00:16:53,560
Of course,

341
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:55,320
maybe it's also because of my abilities

342
00:16:55,970 --> 00:16:57,170
has been seen

343
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:58,440
and liked by You Qiang,

344
00:16:58,440 --> 00:16:59,730
he forced me to come with him

345
00:16:59,730 --> 00:17:00,640
and become his subordinates.

346
00:17:07,920 --> 00:17:09,680
I also have no other way.

347
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,010
Just think about it, a good young man like me,

348
00:17:12,010 --> 00:17:13,560
where is it possible to follow the mafia?

349
00:17:13,560 --> 00:17:14,440
Oh, right?

350
00:17:14,440 --> 00:17:16,280
Their actions clearly include...

351
00:17:17,130 --> 00:17:18,610
kidnapping ra...

352
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:21,040
kidnapping people and forcing good people to do bad things.

353
00:17:22,130 --> 00:17:22,920
Mr Officer.

354
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,280
Today I met you.

355
00:17:26,250 --> 00:17:27,440
Let's just say I report a crime.

356
00:17:28,320 --> 00:17:28,970
Really.

357
00:17:29,530 --> 00:17:31,890
Every day I follow You Qiang,

358
00:17:31,890 --> 00:17:33,890
he told me to beat and kill every day.

359
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:35,850
I'm telling you the truth.

360
00:17:36,770 --> 00:17:38,490
I feel very guilty.

361
00:17:40,650 --> 00:17:42,800
If you already follow You Qiang,

362
00:17:44,040 --> 00:17:45,800
Then, why do you still continue to deliver food?

363
00:17:46,320 --> 00:17:48,250
Because I love this job.

364
00:17:48,560 --> 00:17:49,530
You just want to search

365
00:17:49,530 --> 00:17:50,970
your biological parents.

366
00:17:52,770 --> 00:17:53,610
Because of this work,

367
00:17:53,610 --> 00:17:55,370
places traveled and people met a lot.

368
00:17:55,490 --> 00:17:56,530
Maybe someday,

369
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,080
Your wish can really come true.

370
00:18:00,010 --> 00:18:01,800
You can find your biological parents.

371
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:15,610
You know quite a lot too.

372
00:18:19,440 --> 00:18:20,130
Because you have

373
00:18:20,130 --> 00:18:21,440
check that detail,

374
00:18:22,650 --> 00:18:23,680
I think you told me to come here,

375
00:18:23,680 --> 00:18:25,040
nor is it just for chatting.

376
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:27,160
If necessary,

377
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:29,080
please just be straight forward.

378
00:18:36,370 --> 00:18:37,370
The person in this photo

379
00:18:37,370 --> 00:18:38,370
bernama Feng Xiaosheng.

380
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,010
Founder of Feng Group,

381
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:42,080
putra Feng Yong,

382
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,650

389
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:00,440
understand?

390
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:01,370
Then, just collect it.

391
00:19:01,370 --> 00:19:02,010
Fine.

392
00:19:02,650 --> 00:19:03,320

395
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:06,250
I'll go there first.

396
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:07,610
Slowly.

397
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:09,010
Yu Chengbo,

398
00:19:09,010 --> 00:19:09,850
Mrs. Lecturer Ke is looking for you.

399
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,610
Miss Lecturer?

400
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:13,160
Help me explain it.

401
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:14,200
Good.

402
00:19:18,970 --> 00:19:19,560
Sorry,

403
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:20,440
I accidentally.

404
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:21,320
You're okay, right?

405
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:26,650
It doesn't matter.

406
00:19:27,400 --> 00:19:29,250
Because you didn't mean to,

407
00:19:29,250 --> 00:19:30,200
I will forgive you.

408
00:19:30,440 --> 00:19:31,200
I'm grateful.

409
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:32,320
Thank You.

410
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,440
I still have things to do,

411
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,250
I'll go first, okay?

412
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,850
How?

413
00:19:38,490 --> 00:19:39,800
Are you hurt?

414
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,160
I am alright.

415
00:19:41,160 --> 00:19:42,680
I told you to take it slow,

416
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:43,920
you are really stubborn.

417
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,490
Base.

418
00:19:45,490 --> 00:19:46,610
Slowly, yes.

419
00:19:49,160 --> 00:19:49,800
Halo,

420
00:19:49,800 --> 00:19:50,920
I came to re-register.

421
00:19:50,970 --> 00:19:51,730
What major?

422
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:52,650
International finance.

423
00:19:53,490 --> 00:19:54,250
Yu Chengbo,

424
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,850

425
00:19:58,970 --> 00:20:00,130

428
00:20:11,400 --> 00:20:12,130
Come in.

429
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:13,920
Mrs. Ke, looking for me?

430
00:20:18,680 --> 00:20:19,850
This is the contact number

431
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,250
Professor Fan Jianxin from the Institute of Accountancy.

432
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:23,370
This semester he needs an assistant

433
00:20:23,730 --> 00:20:25,320
to help him do the translation work.

434
00:20:25,610 --> 00:20:26,730
I recommended you to him.

435
00:20:27,650 --> 00:20:29,490
Although the salary will not be very high,

436
00:20:30,160 --> 00:20:31,440
but you can learn a lot of things.

437
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:32,130
Really?

438
00:20:32,610 --> 00:20:33,400
That's good.

439
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:35,160
Don't be happy yet.

440
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,200
Professor Fan has high standards.

441
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:38,490
Stay cool,

442
00:20:38,490 --> 00:20:39,370
I will try.

443
00:20:40,130 --> 00:20:40,730
Just that,

444
00:20:40,730 --> 00:20:41,400
go away

445
00:20:43,010 --> 00:20:43,730
Bu Ke,

00:20:44,370 --> 00:20:45,370
tonight in the small field

447
00:20:45,370 --> 00:20:45,920

449
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,400

450
00:20:49,890 --> 00:20:50,800
I'm not coming

451
00:20:50,800 --> 00:20:51,730

I bought it a long time ago.

495
00:24:57,160 --> 00:24:57,770
However, I always do

496
00:24:57,770 --> 00:24:59,010
dare not take it out.

497
00:24:59,730 --> 00:25:01,650
I only dare to hide and see for myself,

499
00:25:06,130 --> 00:25:07,680

501
00:25:10,730 --> 00:25:11,800
or keep a dog.

- Marry him! - Marry him!

Can you keep two cats?

512
00:26:01,850 --> 00:26:02,890
Yes.

513
00:26:04,040 --> 00:26:04,920
I'm ready!

514
00:28:18,010 --> 00:28:19,250
Don't, don't.

515
00:28:23,890 --> 00:28:24,370
Don't.

00:28:27,800 --> 00:28:28,440
Do not come close.

517
00:28:28,440 --> 00:28:30,610
Don't kill me, don't...

518
00:30:02,800 --> 00:30:03,560
Miss Ke,

519
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:05,850
try to remember it carefully.

520
00:30:06,160 --> 00:30:07,440
Are you alone

521
00:30:07,560 --> 00:30:08,800
who forgot to close the window?

522
00:30:11,040 --> 00:30:11,850
Everything has been checked,

523
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:13,160
there was no trace of the intruder.

524
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:16,010
Policeman,

525
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,040
I'm certain,

526
00:30:17,040 --> 00:30:18,530
before I went to sleep I did

527
00:30:18,530 --> 00:30:19,730
closed my doors and windows.

528
00:30:20,490 --> 00:30:22,160
Now the window is open,

529
00:30:22,370 --> 00:30:23,800
the door is also open.

530
00:30:23,800 --> 00:30:24,890
If no one comes in,

531
00:30:25,280 --> 00:30:26,320
So, who comes in?

532
00:30:27,080 --> 00:30:28,440
Can you guys use

533
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:29,440
special skills

534
00:30:29,890 --> 00:30:30,800
the police?

535
00:30:31,650 --> 00:30:32,530
For example,

536
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:34,370
comb with a small brush

537
00:30:34,370 --> 00:30:35,650
to check

538
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:37,650
are there any suspicious traces.

539
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:41,530
For example hair, fingerprints, dandruff.

540
00:30:43,040 --> 00:30:43,970
Miss Ke.

541
00:30:44,400 --> 00:30:45,400
The situation you reported,

542
00:30:45,400 --> 00:30:46,850
I have written it down in detail.

543
00:30:47,280 --> 00:30:48,560
We have also checked the location

544
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:49,730
and it wasn't found

545
00:30:49,730 --> 00:30:50,920
there are traces of intruders.

546
00:30:51,370 --> 00:30:52,250
Let's make it like this,

547
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:53,200
these several days,

548
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:54,610
try to pay attention

549
00:30:55,250 --> 00:30:56,370
and see if there is anyone suspicious

550
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:57,530
or something happens.

551
00:30:57,530 --> 00:30:58,490
If there are,

552
00:30:58,530 --> 00:30:59,680
please report the police immediately.

553
00:31:00,280 --> 00:31:01,370
Thank you for your cooperation.

Surface.

557
00:31:11,250 --> 00:31:12,280
You are...

558
00:31:13,920 --> 00:31:14,770
I'm girlfriend...

559
00:31:15,970 --> 00:31:16,770
her fiancé.

560
00:31:17,280 --> 00:31:18,920
I'm his fiancé.

561
00:31:20,440 --> 00:31:21,280
It is such a coincidence.

562
00:31:22,040 --> 00:31:23,530
Please accompany Miss Ke.

563
00:31:23,770 --> 00:31:25,160
He was a little scared.

564
00:32:08,440 --> 00:32:09,160
Ke Ying.

565
00:32:09,970 --> 00:32:10,850
I told you

566
00:32:10,850 --> 00:32:11,920
to you on the phone,

567
00:32:12,400 --> 00:32:13,680
Shen Shijie sudah mati.

568
00:32:14,160 --> 00:32:16,160
I saw him jump into the ravine.

569
00:32:17,280 --> 00:32:18,970
Don't suspect this any more.

570
00:32:20,610 --> 00:32:21,800
Officer Chen, I know.

571
00:32:22,400 --> 00:32:23,560
However, today I invite you here...

572
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:26,130
is to prove a point.

573
00:32:26,130 --> 00:32:27,160
If it can be proven,

574
00:32:27,160 --> 00:32:28,610
then this matter relates to you.

575
00:32:28,610 --> 00:32:29,970
Related to me?

576
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:32,440
Later someone will come.

577
00:32:32,770 --> 00:32:33,800
I'll call him.

578
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:35,530
You take the photo with this camera.

579
00:32:35,770 --> 00:32:36,610
Expressions, reactions,

580
00:32:36,610 --> 00:32:38,010
You have to photograph it clearly.

581
00:32:38,040 --> 00:32:38,800
Ke Ying,

582
00:32:39,370 --> 00:32:40,650
this is not good.

583
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,890
However, I...

584
00:32:58,400 --> 00:32:59,040
Ke Ying.

585
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:01,040
Ke Ying!

586
00:33:02,890 --> 00:33:03,680
Shen Shijie!

587
00:33:47,680 --> 00:33:49,010
At that time you called him from behind,

588
00:33:49,010 --> 00:33:50,490
even though he turned his head,

589
00:33:50,890 --> 00:33:51,680
but that also can't be proven

590
00:33:51,680 --> 00:33:53,040
that he was Shen Shijie.

591
00:33:53,770 --> 00:33:55,040
Please you believe me.

592
00:33:56,610 --> 00:33:58,370
Feng Xiaosheng dan Shen Shijie,

593
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,770
there's definitely a connection.

594
00:34:00,040 --> 00:34:01,680
I wouldn't look wrong.

595
00:34:02,010 --> 00:34:03,970
Their eyes are similar.

596
00:34:04,730 --> 00:34:05,890
Aren't you, the police

597
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:07,650
always look at fingerprints when investigating cases?

598
00:34:07,920 --> 00:34:08,920
Isn't your foundation is

599
00:34:08,920 --> 00:34:09,680
There isn't any

600
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,160
the same fingerprint in this world?

601
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:12,810
What about the eyes?

602
00:34:12,810 --> 00:34:14,330
In this world where is it possible?

603
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:15,440
similar eyes?

604
00:34:15,730 --> 00:34:16,570
They are the same person.

605
00:34:16,570 --> 00:34:17,600
They are the same person.

606
00:34:17,880 --> 00:34:18,680
Shen Shijie telah kembali.

607
00:34:18,680 --> 00:34:19,400
He came looking for me,

608
00:34:19,400 --> 00:34:20,570
I can feel it.

609
00:34:21,810 --> 00:34:22,530
No.

610
00:34:22,970 --> 00:34:24,360
This isn't just my feeling.

611
00:34:25,970 --> 00:34:27,160
This is a fact.

612
00:34:29,050 --> 00:34:29,570
Ke Ying.

613
00:34:29,570 --> 00:34:30,810
Officer Chen.

614
00:34:32,810 --> 00:34:34,360
Please don't assume

615
00:34:35,570 --> 00:34:36,160
I said

616
00:34:36,160 --> 00:34:37,330
all this because it has

617
00:34:37,330 --> 00:34:38,360
got a shock.

618
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:41,920
I want to ask you,

619
00:34:42,730 --> 00:34:43,400
When we

620
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:44,680
discussing this,

621
00:34:45,920 --> 00:34:47,120
You have to instill

622
00:34:47,120 --> 00:34:49,360
a thought in the head,

623
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,490
namely...

624
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:52,920
Ke Ying is not crazy.

625
00:34:54,490 --> 00:34:55,360
No problem.

626
00:34:56,290 --> 00:34:57,290
Actually, Ke Ying,

627
00:34:57,290 --> 00:34:58,400
I really admire you.

628
00:34:59,290 --> 00:35:01,090
A meek woman like you,

629
00:35:01,330 --> 00:35:03,360
if you want to escape from the hands of three people

630
00:35:03,360 --> 00:35:04,730
very cruel criminal,

631
00:35:05,600 --> 00:35:07,250
that's almost impossible.

632
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:10,330
I've been a police officer for 30 years.

633
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:12,360
Criminal case of

634
00:35:12,360 --> 00:35:13,200
small to large,

635
00:35:13,200 --> 00:35:14,360
I've experienced a lot.

636
00:35:16,050 --> 00:35:16,840
However, you...

637
00:35:17,810 --> 00:35:18,880
not only managed to escape,

638
00:35:19,640 --> 00:35:20,290
but also causes

639
00:35:20,290 --> 00:35:22,050
one person died, two people were injured.

640
00:35:22,880 --> 00:35:24,680
You could say this is a miracle.

641
00:35:28,200 --> 00:35:29,400
That's because you're brave

642
00:35:30,250 --> 00:35:32,090
and you handle it calmly.

643
00:35:33,330 --> 00:35:35,010
You also said that I was calm.

644
00:35:36,840 --> 00:35:38,680
Then, why don't you believe me?

645
00:35:40,050 --> 00:35:41,680
Ke Ying, do you believe me?

646
00:35:43,330 --> 00:35:44,090
Of course.

647
00:35:44,090 --> 00:35:44,920
Okay.

648
00:35:46,200 --> 00:35:46,730
At the moment at all

649
00:35:46,730 --> 00:35:48,120
there is no evidence or indication,

650
00:35:48,680 --> 00:35:50,970
which can prove that Shen Shijie is still alive.

651
00:35:52,120 --> 00:35:53,050
However, I really saw it,

652
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,090
dia adalah Shen Shijie.

653
00:35:54,090 --> 00:35:55,120
Ke Ying.

654
00:35:57,290 --> 00:35:59,010
Time is the best medicine.

655
00:36:00,050 --> 00:36:01,490
can offer everything.

656
00:36:02,920 --> 00:36:04,840
All you need now is time.

657
00:36:09,840 --> 00:36:10,360
As a policeman

658
00:36:10,360 --> 00:36:11,570
who is investigating this case...

659
00:36:12,290 --> 00:36:12,970
Ke Ying,

660
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,400
i want to tell you,

661
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,400
no matter when,

662
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:19,250
any thoughts or hints

663
00:36:19,250 --> 00:36:20,090
what you have,

664
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:22,090
you can tell us any time.

665
00:36:22,770 --> 00:36:24,200
We will definitely appreciate it.

666
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:26,440
Because this is our responsibility.

667
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,880
However, Ke Ying...

668
00:36:30,920 --> 00:36:32,490
I also have to tell you,

669
00:36:32,920 --> 00:36:35,090
your actions this morning

670
00:36:35,090 --> 00:36:36,600
really inappropriate.

671
00:36:37,810 --> 00:36:39,090
You should trust the police,

672
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:40,970
believe in the law.

673
00:36:41,880 --> 00:36:42,680
Of?

674
00:37:15,570 --> 00:37:16,330
Sis Qiang has come.

675
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:18,570
Kak Qiang.

676
00:37:20,570 --> 00:37:21,120
Qiang.

677
00:37:24,770 --> 00:37:26,570
Ba Lian asked me to meet.

678
00:37:33,810 --> 00:37:34,490
Come on, Wu.

679
00:37:34,490 --> 00:37:35,120
Sit down, sit down.

680
00:37:35,330 --> 00:37:35,970
Come on, come on, come on.

681
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:36,810
Ayo.

682
00:37:37,010 --> 00:37:37,810
Come on, drink.

683
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:39,360
Let's play cards.

684
00:37:39,360 --> 00:37:40,050
Main brag?

685
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:40,490
Yes.

686
00:37:40,490 --> 00:37:41,090
Let's start.

687
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:41,770
Good.

688
00:37:44,090 --> 00:37:44,640
Three.

689
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,360
Don't hit me.

690
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:14,770
Don't hit me.

691
00:38:15,730 --> 00:38:16,570
Don't hit me.

692
00:39:03,020 --> 00:39:06,900
(Payphone)

693
00:39:33,090 --> 00:39:34,050
What are you doing?

694
00:39:34,050 --> 00:39:35,250
Hiding like that.

695
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:42,330
I've been watching it.

696
00:39:42,570 --> 00:39:43,400
There's no one behind.

697
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:48,600
What's wrong with your hand?

698
00:39:49,730 --> 00:39:50,120
It doesn't matter.

699
00:39:51,490 --> 00:39:52,360
Just bumped.

700
00:39:54,570 --> 00:39:55,570
What's the problem?

701
00:40:00,840 --> 00:40:01,530
Lately,

702
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:02,810
in the gambling place increased

703
00:40:02,810 --> 00:40:04,570
someone with a scar on his face.

704
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:07,570
You Qiang was very reluctant towards him.

705
00:40:08,360 --> 00:40:09,680
Also gave him a lot of money.

706
00:40:09,840 --> 00:40:10,840
How much did he give her?

707
00:40:12,570 --> 00:40:13,440
About 500 thousand yuan.

708
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:16,570
Slowly, really here?

709
00:40:17,290 --> 00:40:18,400
About here.

710
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:19,970
Let's look again.

711
00:40:21,090 --> 00:40:21,920
Let's change places.

712
00:40:29,770 --> 00:40:31,010
Ba Lian is a fugitive.

713
00:40:31,090 --> 00:40:32,880
He's probably carrying a gun.

714
00:40:37,970 --> 00:40:39,050
Most likely they are

715
00:40:39,290 --> 00:40:40,970
talking about smuggling.

716
00:40:41,530 --> 00:40:42,330
Help us keep an eye out

717
00:40:42,330 --> 00:40:43,120
and find out.

718
00:40:48,090 --> 00:40:49,770
You said you were a fugitive

719
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,680
have a gun?

720
00:40:51,810 --> 00:40:52,440
Correct.

721
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:56,680
When looking for information,

722
00:40:56,770 --> 00:40:58,360
you have to take care of your own safety.

723
00:40:58,840 --> 00:40:59,770
If you encounter danger,

724
00:41:00,050 --> 00:41:01,090
you can stop at any time.

725
00:41:02,090 --> 00:41:04,360
Look, I'm dying to do it,

726
00:41:04,970 --> 00:41:06,530
You won't let me work thanklessly, right?

727
00:41:08,730 --> 00:41:09,920
I understand what you mean.

728
00:41:11,120 --> 00:41:11,810
Won't.

729
00:41:14,810 --> 00:41:15,360
Okay.

730
00:41:16,050 --> 00:41:17,490
With your guarantee, I'm willing to do anything.

731
00:41:19,400 --> 00:41:19,970
He came.

732
00:41:22,440 --> 00:41:24,400
He is indeed the most handsome man on campus.

733
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:25,050
Miao Miao,

734
00:41:25,050 --> 00:41:26,160
are you sure you can conquer it?

735
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,250
If you can't,

736
00:41:27,250 --> 00:41:28,530
How can I avenge the collision?

737
00:41:28,530 --> 00:41:29,290
Pay close attention.

738
00:41:29,290 --> 00:41:30,050
Hurry up, hurry up.

739
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,090
Senior Brother.

740
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:33,490
Senior Brother Yu.

741
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:34,490
What else?

742
00:41:35,970 --> 00:41:37,250
I just want to ask

743
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:38,840
to Senior Brother about organization.

744
00:41:39,250 --> 00:41:40,730
It depends on your own hobbies.

745
00:41:41,640 --> 00:41:42,360
What about Senior Brother?

746
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:43,490
What organization does Senior Brother belong to?

747
00:41:43,680 --> 00:41:44,600
Financial management.

748
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:46,970
Finance?

749
00:41:47,330 --> 00:41:48,490
Is there anything else?

750
00:41:49,330 --> 00:41:50,090
There isn't any.

751
00:41:53,730 --> 00:41:54,640
Do you still have anything else to do?

752
00:41:55,570 --> 00:41:56,920
Do you have any business?

753
00:41:57,200 --> 00:41:58,200
I want to submit a report.

754
00:41:58,770 --> 00:41:59,640
Then, go.

755
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:20,680
This is

756
00:42:20,680 --> 00:42:22,570
a new kind of PTSD therapy.

757
00:42:22,770 --> 00:42:25,050
What is meant by PTSD is

758
00:42:25,160 --> 00:42:27,090
post-traumatic stress disorder.

759
00:42:27,090 --> 00:42:27,600
This side.

760
00:42:27,880 --> 00:42:29,200
He can connect

761
00:42:29,200 --> 00:42:31,120
the power of creation and the power of destruction,

762
00:42:31,640 --> 00:42:32,440
makes our hearts

763
00:42:32,440 --> 00:42:34,010
reconnect with

764
00:42:34,440 --> 00:42:35,290
previous personal

765
00:42:35,290 --> 00:42:36,770
who is healthy and calm

766
00:42:36,770 --> 00:42:37,840
starting from deficiencies.

767
00:42:38,770 --> 00:42:39,810
Our final goal is

768
00:42:39,810 --> 00:42:40,810
let them

769
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:43,250
vent the stress in my heart on this mask.

770
00:42:43,840 --> 00:42:45,050
In order for trauma to colonize the heart

771
00:42:45,050 --> 00:42:45,840
left behind here

772
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:47,120
and complete self-healing.

773
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,490
Finally, exit this door

774
00:42:48,490 --> 00:42:49,530
with a light step.

775
00:42:50,570 --> 00:42:51,680
(If the depression is serious,)

776
00:42:51,680 --> 00:42:52,840
(there will be an anxiety disorder)

777
00:42:52,840 --> 00:42:54,330
(or neurasthenia.)

778
00:42:55,440 --> 00:42:56,840
(Worse will arise)

779
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,330
(mild schizophrenia.)

780
00:42:58,640 --> 00:43:01,120
(Auditory or visual hallucinations will occur.)

781
00:43:02,200 --> 00:43:03,090
(When you walk down the street)

782
00:43:03,250 --> 00:43:03,970
(will feel everyone)

783
00:43:03,970 --> 00:43:04,880
(watching you.)

784
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:06,530
(Even if it's just passing by)

785
00:43:06,530 --> 00:43:07,360
(with strangers,)

786
00:43:07,970 --> 00:43:08,600
(you will feel it too)

787
00:43:08,600 --> 00:43:10,120
(That person has bad intentions towards you.)

788
00:43:11,810 --> 00:43:12,680
(You'll hear someone)

789
00:43:12,680 --> 00:43:14,010
(suddenly calls your name.)

790
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:14,530
(Ke Ying.)

791
00:43:14,570 --> 00:43:15,250
(Even)

792
00:43:15,250 --> 00:43:16,840
(another strange sound.)

793
00:43:16,840 --> 00:43:17,730
(Ke Ying.)

794
00:43:18,490 --> 00:43:19,810
