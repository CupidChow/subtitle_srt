00:01:30,580 --> 00:01:32,300
=Episode 7=

3
00:01:38,580 --> 00:01:39,900
In June this year.

4
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:41,820
Before June,

5
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,860
probably around April or May.

6
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:45,340
major surgery.

7
00:01:45,620 --> 00:01:47,140
There should be records that can be checked.

8
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:47,140
I...

9
00:02:49,340 --> 00:02:50,540
There was a little problem,

10
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:51,940
looks like our game

11
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:54,020
will end early.

12
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,060
What are you doing?

13
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:02,900
It is okay, right?

14
00:03:07,060 --> 00:03:07,700
Buddy,

15
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:09,260
who... who are you?

16
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:15,620
Do you know who I am?

17
00:03:17,260 --> 00:03:18,260
I'm a policeman,

18
00:03:18,260 --> 00:03:19,660
If you do this, it includes attacking the police.

19
00:03:20,020 --> 00:03:21,180
Pe... slow down a little, slow down a little.

20
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:21,740
It hurts, it hurts, it hurts.

21
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,420
Dude, just kidding.

22
00:03:22,580 --> 00:03:24,740
Buddy, I'm telling you, yeah.

23
00:03:25,300 --> 00:03:26,500
Bosku, Dao Jian,

24
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,860
the famous second uncle, you know, right?

25
00:03:28,340 --> 00:03:29,260
He is our boss.

26
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,500
This

27
00:03:31,180 --> 00:03:32,500
is the boss's lover.

28
00:03:33,620 --> 00:03:34,700
If second uncle finds out,

29
00:03:34,940 --> 00:03:35,780
you dare touch his girlfriend,

30
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,260
bullying his best friend,

31
00:03:36,260 --> 00:03:37,260
you will die.

32
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:38,580
I suggest you leave immediately.

33
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,540
Medium Frog on the street,

34
00:03:41,540 --> 00:03:42,980
Maybe there's still time if you go now.

35
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:44,300
Why are you just standing there?

36
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:45,420
Call the boss quickly!

37
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:48,220
Plan a little, release.

38
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:53,620
You know yourself too.

39
00:03:54,140 --> 00:03:55,460
Don't let me see you again.

40
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:57,940
If I see you again...

41
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:03,660
You're fine, right?

42
00:04:08,780 --> 00:04:09,580
What do you want?

43
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:14,340
Do not act carelessly.

44
00:04:16,900 --> 00:04:18,140
Watch your mouth.

45
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:40,180
Who is that damn kid?

46
00:04:42,180 --> 00:04:43,260
Your ex-boyfriend, huh?

47
00:04:44,900 --> 00:04:45,620
You don't recognize him?

48
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:46,380
How can I recognize it?

49
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:47,660
Like a masked hero.

50
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:49,500
Your guts are so big,

51
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:50,620
dare to bring a man to this place.

52
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:52,060
If Brother Dao Jian finds out, you can be beaten to death.

53
00:04:57,900 --> 00:04:58,740
Your stuff.

54
00:05:24,940 --> 00:05:26,940
Captain Xiao, long time no see.

55
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:36,020
Not this

56
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:37,780
that famous second uncle?

57
00:05:37,780 --> 00:05:38,500
Kapten Xiao,

58
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:41,020
your joke is too big.

59
00:05:41,180 --> 00:05:41,700
All of these

60
00:05:41,700 --> 00:05:43,180
I told you several years ago.

61
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,620
Why open an old story?

62
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,620
I'm not offending you, am I?

63
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:47,500
How do you know

64
00:05:47,500 --> 00:05:48,620
you didn't offend me?

65
00:05:50,420 --> 00:05:50,780
no,

66
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:52,020
what do you mean by that?

67
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,660
What does that mean?

68
00:05:55,780 --> 00:05:56,460
Feng Meng,

69
00:05:57,620 --> 00:05:59,780
your cheap nightclub,

70
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:01,460
pornographic action, betting, drugs, it's all there.

71
00:06:01,820 --> 00:06:03,340
Even the provincial committee leaders know,

72
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:04,740
and scolded me directly.

73
00:06:04,740 --> 00:06:06,020
What do you think I mean?

74
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:07,620
Why?

75
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,980
You're planning on waiting for me to get fired,

76
00:06:10,340 --> 00:06:12,100
then pay my pension?

77
00:06:14,380 --> 00:06:15,180
This... this...

78
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:17,260
understand, understand.

79
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:19,900
However, I'll tell you the truth.

80
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:21,940
Since I retired,

81
00:06:21,980 --> 00:06:24,180
I have transferred many businesses.

82
00:06:24,620 --> 00:06:25,460
That night club

83
00:06:25,460 --> 00:06:27,220
it has nothing to do with me anymore.

84
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,220
Nothing to do with you,

85
00:06:28,220 --> 00:06:29,780
why did you come here?

86
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:32,340
Last year, you were still the owner,

87
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:33,740
now it's Zhang Zhigao.

88
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:35,340
Who is Zhang Zhigao?

89
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:36,700
What does that have to do with you?

90
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:39,460
Don't say you don't know him, okay?

91
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:41,220
Zhang Zhigao ini,

92
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,180
I really don't know.

93
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:45,500
To be honest,

94
00:06:45,500 --> 00:06:46,620
at that time, all the procedures

95
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:48,140
handled by a lawyer.

96
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,060
Transferred to whom,

97
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:50,060
I really don't know.

98
00:06:50,700 --> 00:06:51,620
You calm your emotions first.

99
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:52,420
Like this,

100
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,140
After I get home, I'll check

101
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:55,260
who actually did it

102
00:06:55,260 --> 00:06:56,260
something that violates the law like this.

103
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,060
I'll tell him to

104
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,020
come straight to report to you.

105
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:58,980
Who makes trouble for you,

106
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:00,260
- that means trouble for me too. - Captain Xiao.

107
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,300
Xu Jie has been caught.

108
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:03,540
Immediately interrogated.

109
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:04,060
Good.

110
00:07:09,580 --> 00:07:13,300
Captain Xiao, I was also asked for help.

111
00:07:16,580 --> 00:07:18,300
You are generous,

112
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:19,940
how much is the fine, I will pay it.

113
00:07:20,260 --> 00:07:21,140
You just say the numbers.

114
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:28,380
Who?

115
00:07:30,820 --> 00:07:31,540
Chairman Pei.

116
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,020
Hello, hello.

117
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,140
Good.

118
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:50,660
You just calm down.

119
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:51,580
I understand.

120
00:07:59,660 --> 00:08:00,540
Did you ask him for help?

121
00:08:01,700 --> 00:08:02,420
Who?

122
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:07,260
Chief Pei that?

123
00:08:10,780 --> 00:08:12,940
You're using your top to pressure me, aren't you?

124
00:08:14,540 --> 00:08:16,220
This... this I really don't dare.

125
00:08:16,220 --> 00:08:17,260
How can I do something like that?

126
00:08:17,980 --> 00:08:18,700
After all,

127
00:08:19,020 --> 00:08:20,500
with our relationship,

128
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:21,580
what's the problem

129
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:22,900
I'll just look for you straight away.

130
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:24,860
Why beat around the bush like that?

131
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:23,420
Say it.

132
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:26,620
Ask for cigarettes, Policeman.

133
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,340
I was the one who hit that person.

134
00:09:45,340 --> 00:09:47,100
This bastard's father owes me.

135
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:48,660
I made him bear it.

136
00:09:49,580 --> 00:09:50,380
Just like that.

137
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:52,740
OK, you guys talk first.

138
00:09:58,580 --> 00:09:59,540
Say it well.

139
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,980
Latest news,

140
00:10:08,980 --> 00:10:10,660
at 20.16

141
00:10:10,780 --> 00:10:12,620
Nanzhou City police received a report,

142
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:14,660
said, a high-end nightclub on Huaihai Street,

143
00:10:14,660 --> 00:10:15,540
Jujinxiao,

144
00:10:15,540 --> 00:10:17,260
engaging in gambling and pornography.

145
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,020
After receiving the report, the police

146
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,540
immediately go to the location and carry out an investigation.

147
00:10:20,860 --> 00:10:23,020
Currently, it is still under investigation.

148
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:45,700
You are the owner

149
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,020
Jujinxiao nightclub, right?

150
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,140
True, right?

151
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:53,620
Correct.

152
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:55,300
When we did the inspection,

153
00:10:55,340 --> 00:10:57,740
it was discovered that in the nightclub there was a group of people gambling,

154
00:10:57,740 --> 00:10:59,420
committing pornographic acts, and so on.

155
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:00,980
As the person in charge,

156
00:11:01,380 --> 00:11:03,020
You must bear the appropriate punishment.

157
00:11:07,900 --> 00:11:09,420
I want to see my lawyer.

158
00:11:12,420 --> 00:11:13,780
Attorney's name and telephone.

159
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:24,900
Bureau Chief Liu.

160
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:26,860
Tongbin.

161
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:28,500
He is Chief Li.

162
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:29,420
- Hello, Captain Xiao. - Bureau Chief Liu,

163
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:31,500
we hardly get a chance,

164
00:11:31,500 --> 00:11:32,780
just caught this guy.

165
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:34,660
Chairman Li is the head of the investigation team

166
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,020
sent by superiors.

167
00:11:38,260 --> 00:11:39,660
Our task this time is more special,

168
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:41,500
never been discussed

169
00:11:41,500 --> 00:11:42,900
with any local party.

170
00:11:45,260 --> 00:11:47,020
Hello, Chairman Li.

171
00:11:47,180 --> 00:11:47,660
Halo.

172
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:50,740
Kapten Xiao,

173
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,460
the situation is like this.

174
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:54,340
A month ago,

175
00:11:54,340 --> 00:11:54,980
we've started

176
00:11:54,980 --> 00:11:56,500
watching over the Feng family.

177
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:58,500
Everyone related to Feng Meng,

178
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,020
will be handed over to the investigation team.

179
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:01,180
However, the child most likely has

180
00:12:01,180 --> 00:12:01,980
kill our people.

181
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:02,860
However, neither do you

182
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,060
find evidence to convict him.

183
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:06,740
Report from anonymous telephone

184
00:12:06,740 --> 00:12:07,660
cannot be used as evidence.

185
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,180
Xu Jie is the one who bears the punishment,

186
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:10,980
nor would he mention Zhang Zhigao's name.

187
00:12:11,060 --> 00:12:12,420
Dia dan Zhang Zhigao...

188
00:12:12,540 --> 00:12:14,180
most likely don't know each other.

189
00:12:14,420 --> 00:12:15,540
Between the two of them,

190
00:12:15,780 --> 00:12:16,380
it should still be there

191
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:17,460
other intermediaries.

192
00:12:17,460 --> 00:12:18,540
It doesn't matter if you know him or not,

193
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:19,860
even if you have to grope in the dark,

194
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:20,540
maybe someday

195
00:12:20,540 --> 00:12:21,260
down to this boy.

196
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,060
Then?

197
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:25,300
Even if we catch him,

198
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:27,100
the real culprit behind this

199
00:12:27,100 --> 00:12:28,540
will still be free outside.

200
00:12:29,780 --> 00:12:30,460
Kapten Xiao,

201
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:32,420
crackdown on black world crime

202
00:12:32,540 --> 00:12:33,860
highly prioritized by the center.

203
00:12:35,460 --> 00:12:37,460
Our target is not just the Feng family,

204
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:38,780
but we also have to

205
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,180
investigate which office

206
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,660
who works with him,

207
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:42,660
eradicate it from the roots.

208
00:12:42,980 --> 00:12:44,100
Pak Xiao Tongbin,

209
00:12:45,900 --> 00:12:47,540
this is a big chess game.

210
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,380
We need to

211
00:12:48,380 --> 00:12:49,740
Full cooperation from the police.

212
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:50,860
Right now, it's all action

213
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,100
related to the Feng family,

214
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:54,260
must be approved by the investigative team.

215
00:12:54,460 --> 00:12:55,540
Can't make them suspicious.

216
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:01,540
Just calm down,

217
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:03,620
we will definitely work together.

218
00:13:10,340 --> 00:13:11,260
Good!

219
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,660
Second Uncle, that's great!

220
00:13:12,660 --> 00:13:13,500
Good.

221
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:14,660
Good, Second Uncle.

222
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:16,980
Don't keep shouting,

223
00:13:16,980 --> 00:13:18,300
civilized place,

224
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,820
can't be noisy.

225
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:21,220
Keep the attitude.

226
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:22,580
Keep the attitude.

227
00:13:26,580 --> 00:13:27,460
Enthusiasm, Sister Qiang.

228
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:31,380
Enthusiasm, Sister Qiang.

229
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:34,220
Straighten your hips.

230
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:35,460
Okay, Second Uncle.

231
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:44,580
How Qiang, bola...

232
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:45,100
The ball...

233
00:13:46,620 --> 00:13:47,380
Kak Qiang.

234
00:13:47,540 --> 00:13:48,940
- The ball. - The ball, it wasn't hit.

235
00:13:48,940 --> 00:13:49,820
The ball is still here.

236
00:13:49,820 --> 00:13:50,500
Second Uncle,

237
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,740
I... I'm not playing anymore, Second Uncle.

238
00:13:51,740 --> 00:13:52,300
If I play,

239
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:53,500
My waist can get gout.

240
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:55,220
A short break.

241
00:13:55,220 --> 00:13:55,980
I'm tired too.

242
00:13:56,540 --> 00:13:57,340
Go ahead, Second Uncle.

243
00:14:02,220 --> 00:14:03,740
Reduce smoking.

244
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:06,620
Don't just know every day

245
00:14:06,620 --> 00:14:07,860
fight and kill.

246
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:11,260
What Sheng said was also true.

247
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,540
The present age

248
00:14:14,540 --> 00:14:16,460
change quickly.

249
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:18,060
We have to learn

250
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:20,660
think about problems scientifically.

251
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:22,900
You have to keep up with the times,

252
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:24,380
must be able to change.

253
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,500
Otherwise, all of us

254
00:14:25,500 --> 00:14:27,180
will be eliminated by time.

255
00:14:27,260 --> 00:14:27,980
That's right, Second Uncle.

256
00:14:27,980 --> 00:14:28,460
Correct.

257
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:31,180
How is business lately?

258
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:33,940
I heard, you're being watched by the police?

259
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:37,540
Catch gambling,

260
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,700
including normal things.

261
00:14:41,620 --> 00:14:44,460
There was a slight loss.

262
00:14:45,300 --> 00:14:46,340
How much?

263
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:49,100
One hundred eighty-nine thousand.

264
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,980
I'm looking for a way.

265
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,940
Big or little money,

266
00:14:56,940 --> 00:14:58,260
it's still a joint fund.

267
00:15:00,260 --> 00:15:01,500
Has it been processed?

268
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:03,100
Because of whom?

269
00:15:04,100 --> 00:15:05,340
Hua Zi.

270
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:06,940
Second Uncle,

271
00:15:07,300 --> 00:15:08,500
that's when it happened

272
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,860
too sudden

273
00:15:10,260 --> 00:15:11,660
The money disappeared,

274
00:15:12,380 --> 00:15:13,540
the person is back.

275
00:15:20,260 --> 00:15:21,180
You Qiang,

276
00:15:22,780 --> 00:15:24,300
Looks like I still need to teach you

277
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:26,260
how to lead a group, huh?

278
00:15:29,660 --> 00:15:30,740
Who's name is Hua Zi?

279
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:34,980
Second Uncle,

280
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:35,660
I understand.

281
00:15:35,660 --> 00:15:37,460
Company money, no matter how much, is still a big deal.

282
00:15:37,460 --> 00:15:38,300
You just calm down about this kid.

283
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,380
When I come home, I'll definitely...

284
00:15:40,460 --> 00:15:41,660
You are Hua Zi?

285
00:15:41,700 --> 00:15:42,580
Second Uncle, sorry!

286
00:15:42,580 --> 00:15:43,220
You are Hua Zi?

287
00:15:43,220 --> 00:15:43,940
Sorry, Second Uncle!

288
00:15:43,940 --> 00:15:44,980
You are Hua Zi?

289
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:46,580
- You're still back? - Second Uncle, Second Uncle.

290
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:47,940
- Second Uncle. - Do you still dare to come back?

291
00:15:48,300 --> 00:15:49,180
Second Uncle, Second Uncle.

292
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,860
I'm sorry, Second Uncle.

293
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,860
If I get money, do I share it with you?

294
00:15:53,980 --> 00:15:54,780
Ada.

295
00:15:54,860 --> 00:15:55,500
Ada?

296
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:57,420
You're so happy when you get money,

297
00:15:57,420 --> 00:15:58,100
now the money is gone,

298
00:15:58,100 --> 00:15:59,340
You're irresponsible, aren't you?

299
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:00,740
I will take responsibility.

300
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:02,060
What do you think, Second Uncle?

301
00:16:04,900 --> 00:16:05,740
I swear,

302
00:16:05,740 --> 00:16:06,220
Second Uncle,

303
00:16:06,220 --> 00:16:08,460
I will definitely lead the group well.

304
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:09,420
Lost money

305
00:16:09,420 --> 00:16:10,940
I'll definitely look for it again,

306
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,980
compensate the company for losses.

307
00:16:12,100 --> 00:16:13,860
You can rest easy about this.

308
00:16:14,300 --> 00:16:16,220
You can rest assured regarding all company business.

309
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,100
I'm there to take care of it.

310
00:16:18,380 --> 00:16:19,020
Come, Second Uncle,

311
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:19,900
You don't get emotional.

312
00:16:25,420 --> 00:16:26,900
What wine is this?

313
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:32,140
What wine is this?

314
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,660
Say.

315
00:16:57,500 --> 00:16:58,500
Already found out.

316
00:16:59,100 --> 00:17:00,740
There really is a team of investigators like that,

317
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:03,220
but no one knows clearly the situation.

318
00:17:05,060 --> 00:17:05,860
Besides that,

319
00:17:07,380 --> 00:17:08,380
I went home

320
00:17:08,380 --> 00:17:09,820
Branch Chief Wang and Chief Liu,

321
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:12,220
but didn't get any information.

322
00:17:12,540 --> 00:17:14,780
Then, the things I brought,

323
00:17:15,020 --> 00:17:16,460
they dare not accept.

324
00:17:16,620 --> 00:17:19,820
Apparently, there is a bit of a problem.

325
00:17:20,100 --> 00:17:21,660
However, what stage are you actually at...

326
00:17:22,260 --> 00:17:23,500
it's still hard to say.

327
00:17:23,940 --> 00:17:25,460
There's nothing hard to say.

328
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:29,060
The storm will arrive soon.

329
00:17:32,260 --> 00:17:35,020
In the past it was always just thunder without rain,

330
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:36,540
passed in a single blow of the wind.

331
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,140
This time...

332
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,140
Obtained wealth

333
00:17:41,140 --> 00:17:42,580
relying on power,

334
00:17:44,300 --> 00:17:45,660
it's too fragile.

335
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:48,700
Once power is destroyed,

336
00:17:50,380 --> 00:17:53,660
all wealth turns into paper money.

337
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,060
Although the logic is simple,

338
00:17:59,340 --> 00:18:02,660
but how many people can realize it

339
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,020
and stop right next to a cliff?

340
00:18:10,700 --> 00:18:12,180
What about company affairs?

341
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:15,940
It is being carried out according to plan.

342
00:18:16,260 --> 00:18:17,660
I'll give you three months.

343
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,460
At this time or not...

344
00:18:22,380 --> 00:18:23,540
Only three months.

345
00:18:27,140 --> 00:18:28,300
You can't take more than a day either.

346
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:29,660
Understand.

347
00:18:39,220 --> 00:18:40,220
It still hurts, doesn't it?

348
00:18:40,820 --> 00:18:41,820
I don't feel sick anymore.

349
00:18:42,980 --> 00:18:44,020
Do you have any wounds on your body?

350
00:18:44,420 --> 00:18:45,220
Let me see.

351
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:48,220
Nothing, never mind.

352
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:49,500
What do you want to see?

353
00:18:51,820 --> 00:18:53,380
Why hide this from me?

354
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:54,540
If it's not a coincidence

355
00:18:54,540 --> 00:18:55,820
I came and met you,

356
00:18:56,220 --> 00:18:57,420
You want to cover this up completely, right?

357
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,540
I didn't mean to hide it from you.

358
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:02,020
My phone is completely broken.

359
00:19:02,020 --> 00:19:03,740
At that time I was in a hurry to take the students home,

360
00:19:03,860 --> 00:19:04,940
I forgot to fix it.

361
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:05,860
I think, two more days

362
00:19:05,860 --> 00:19:06,900
I'm going home too, right?

363
00:19:06,940 --> 00:19:07,980
Who knows, when you climb a mountain,

364
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:09,020
I even fell into the ditch.

365
00:19:10,860 --> 00:19:12,380
Your student's house

366
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:14,540
where is it actually?

367
00:19:15,860 --> 00:19:17,380
The house is very far away,

368
00:19:17,620 --> 00:19:18,580
in mountainous areas.

369
00:19:19,100 --> 00:19:20,540
After arriving at the bus station,

370
00:19:20,540 --> 00:19:21,860
I had to climb two hills.

371
00:19:21,860 --> 00:19:23,100
Your body is completely unharmed?

372
00:19:23,660 --> 00:19:24,580
Can't, I have to see it.

373
00:19:24,580 --> 00:19:25,340
So that I can be calmer.

374
00:19:27,140 --> 00:19:27,860
Surface.

375
00:19:28,460 --> 00:19:29,060
Did you do it on purpose?

376
00:19:29,060 --> 00:19:30,060
want to take a chance on me?

377
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,300
You're great too.

378
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:35,380
OK, OK, I won't look.

379
00:19:36,860 --> 00:19:38,380
What do you want to eat tonight? I'll cook it.

380
00:19:39,380 --> 00:19:39,860
Let me see

381
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:40,820
what vegetables are there in the refrigerator?

382
00:20:01,220 --> 00:20:02,460
This time you fell like this,

383
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:03,900
including work accidents, right?

384
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:09,900
What kind of work accident?

385
00:20:11,020 --> 00:20:11,900
Just this small wound,

386
00:20:11,900 --> 00:20:12,420
want to make it

387
00:20:12,420 --> 00:20:13,300
until one school finds out,

388
00:20:13,300 --> 00:20:14,820
Wouldn't I lose more?

389
00:21:00,820 --> 00:21:01,700
face

390
00:21:03,380 --> 00:21:05,100
these few days I really miss you.

391
00:21:07,620 --> 00:21:08,340
Base,

392
00:21:09,060 --> 00:21:10,660
If you miss me, why don't you call me?

393
00:21:30,300 --> 00:21:30,820
Kak Qiang,

394
00:21:31,700 --> 00:21:32,580
when are you

395
00:21:32,700 --> 00:21:33,940
let us meet

396
00:21:33,940 --> 00:21:34,660
Big Boss Feng?

397
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,700
Adore him.

398
00:21:37,420 --> 00:21:39,460
The big boss is our emperor.

399
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,940
Are thugs like you who...

400
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:43,300
the level is like this,

401
00:21:43,300 --> 00:21:44,460
can you meet him at will?

402
00:21:46,620 --> 00:21:48,220
Just being able to meet second uncle is already good.

403
00:21:49,140 --> 00:21:51,220
The big boss is long gone

404
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:54,100
become a famous legend.

405
00:21:54,660 --> 00:21:56,220
He has a great son,

406
00:21:57,460 --> 00:22:00,420
can create a small property company

407
00:22:00,820 --> 00:22:01,860
in an instant to be

408
00:22:01,860 --> 00:22:03,700
the greatest company in the province.

409
00:22:05,100 --> 00:22:06,820
The market value is nearly one hundred billion.

410
00:22:07,380 --> 00:22:07,900
This...

411
00:22:08,380 --> 00:22:09,820
Nearly one hundred billion?

412
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:15,940
A fool like you,

413
00:22:15,940 --> 00:22:16,540
don't count anymore.

414
00:22:16,540 --> 00:22:18,140
If you count all day, you won't understand.

415
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:20,420
Bos,

416
00:22:20,420 --> 00:22:21,580
where are we going to eat tonight?

417
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:24,540
Let me welcome your arrival.

418
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:27,860
Ayo.

419
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:29,620
Today I'm the treat.

420
00:22:32,780 --> 00:22:35,180
Sis Qiang, Dao Jian is back.

421
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:38,220
Who?

422
00:22:38,300 --> 00:22:39,060
Dao Jian.

423
00:22:39,780 --> 00:22:40,460
Dao Jian?

424
00:22:42,540 --> 00:22:43,540
It's just a matter of time.

425
00:22:43,620 --> 00:22:44,940
There is a second uncle to protect,

426
00:22:44,940 --> 00:22:46,340
any problem can be covered.

427
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:48,340
Lagi pula, Dao Jian...

428
00:22:48,780 --> 00:22:50,220
that Dao Jian matter

429
00:22:50,220 --> 00:22:51,460
not a big deal either.

430
00:22:55,820 --> 00:22:57,340
(Kantor)

431
00:22:58,340 --> 00:22:59,020
Qiang.

432
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:02,560
(Kantor)

433
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:03,580
Second uncle called you.

434
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,150
(Kantor)

435
00:23:06,180 --> 00:23:06,700
Wu,

436
00:23:07,140 --> 00:23:07,860
follow me.

437
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:12,620
Wu.

438
00:23:33,820 --> 00:23:34,780
Why drive so fast?

439
00:23:34,780 --> 00:23:35,860
Hurry up for reincarnation, huh?

440
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:37,220
Sorry, Boss. Excuse me.

441
00:23:37,540 --> 00:23:38,580
I... I'll take it slow.

442
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:39,860
Wu.

443
00:23:40,620 --> 00:23:42,220
Do you know Mr. Feng?

444
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,820
Mr. Feng which one do you mean?

445
00:23:47,180 --> 00:23:48,700
Strange.

446
00:23:59,820 --> 00:24:00,860
Park the car properly,

447
00:24:01,060 --> 00:24:01,860
and wait here.

448
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:02,820
OK, Boss.

449
00:24:26,380 --> 00:24:28,460
Mr. Zhang, chairman of the board of directors called.

450
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:38,540
Enter.

451
00:24:41,820 --> 00:24:43,540
Chairman of the Board of Directors, Mr. Zhang has arrived.

452
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,620
Mr. Feng.

453
00:24:47,620 --> 00:24:48,260
Sit down.

454
00:24:48,860 --> 00:24:49,540
Please.

455
00:24:55,340 --> 00:24:57,220
I've brought the person.

456
00:24:57,340 --> 00:24:58,100
Sorry to bother.

457
00:24:58,180 --> 00:24:58,860
No hassle.

458
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:00,380
Not a big deal.

459
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:01,940
It's just that this kid...

460
00:25:02,340 --> 00:25:03,140
a little sneaky.

461
00:25:03,740 --> 00:25:05,220
No problem, a little clever is better.

462
00:25:06,140 --> 00:25:08,540
True, clever, clever.

463
00:25:10,060 --> 00:25:11,460
You always follow second uncle's side?

464
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:14,060
I am now helping second uncle

465
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,140
managing the club.

466
00:25:15,140 --> 00:25:16,060
I saw on the news,

467
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:18,020
he said yesterday the police went to the club?

468
00:25:18,740 --> 00:25:20,140
Just a routine check,

469
00:25:20,500 --> 00:25:21,380
once second uncle intervened,

470
00:25:21,380 --> 00:25:22,540
all problems were immediately resolved.

471
00:25:23,820 --> 00:25:26,300
For the public, he said changes would be made,

472
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,340
but actually,

473
00:25:27,340 --> 00:25:28,420
no problem whatsoever.

474
00:25:30,500 --> 00:25:32,220
At your convenience

475
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:33,740
can also come visit.

476
00:25:33,860 --> 00:25:34,500
Good.

477
00:25:35,300 --> 00:25:36,020
Before you come,

478
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:37,020
tell me first,

479
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:38,980
I will arrange it well for you.

480
00:25:40,100 --> 00:25:40,940
As I remember, in the past,

481
00:25:40,980 --> 00:25:42,020
the one on second uncle's side

482
00:25:42,020 --> 00:25:43,100
surnamed Shen.

483
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,580
Did I remember wrong?

484
00:25:51,820 --> 00:25:52,420
No.

485
00:25:52,980 --> 00:25:53,780
That person...

486
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,940
namanya Shen Shijie.

487
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:56,860
where is he

488
00:25:57,380 --> 00:25:58,060
something happened,

489
00:25:58,540 --> 00:25:59,220
is dead.

490
00:26:02,220 --> 00:26:03,020
Oh, I see.

491
00:26:05,260 --> 00:26:06,580
You guys wait for me for a moment at the door,

492
00:26:06,860 --> 00:26:08,300
there are still some things I need to take care of.

493
00:26:08,500 --> 00:26:09,220
After it finishes,

494
00:26:09,580 --> 00:26:10,740
we go down together

495
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:12,300
Good.

496
00:26:39,860 --> 00:26:40,500
Wu.

497
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:41,140
Wu.

498
00:26:41,140 --> 00:26:42,020
Yes, Bos.

499
00:26:42,780 --> 00:26:43,540
Are we going?

500
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,300
Say hello.

501
00:26:51,260 --> 00:26:52,380
The person in this photo

502
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,420
namanya Feng Xiaosheng,

503
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:55,700
son of Feng Yong,

504
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,860
founder of the Feng Group.

505
00:26:57,020 --> 00:26:58,500
currently serves as chairman of the group's board of directors.

506
00:27:01,340 --> 00:27:03,060
Boss, who is he?

507
00:27:04,140 --> 00:27:05,100
Mr. Feng.

508
00:27:05,500 --> 00:27:06,180
Hello, Mr. Feng.

509
00:27:14,780 --> 00:27:15,780
Car show.

510
00:27:18,820 --> 00:27:19,580
Do you like it?

511
00:27:20,540 --> 00:27:21,260
Reasonable.

512
00:27:22,460 --> 00:27:23,260
Would you like to drive it?

513
00:27:25,460 --> 00:27:26,340
Can you drive?

514
00:27:26,660 --> 00:27:27,340
That...

515
00:27:27,700 --> 00:27:28,940
car racer.

516
00:27:30,060 --> 00:27:31,420
He always drives for me.

517
00:27:32,700 --> 00:27:33,740
Thank you for coming.

518
00:27:34,500 --> 00:27:35,380
You are too shy.

519
00:27:35,380 --> 00:27:36,660
In the future, just ask him to follow me.

520
00:27:36,820 --> 00:27:37,540
Good.

521
00:27:37,860 --> 00:27:38,580
Bring the car.

522
00:27:39,700 --> 00:27:40,820
However, Boss...

523
00:27:43,420 --> 00:27:44,100
What is it?

524
00:27:44,780 --> 00:27:46,220
Not willing to follow me, huh?

525
00:27:46,220 --> 00:27:47,220
No, no.

526
00:27:47,220 --> 00:27:48,700
It's just too sudden.

527
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:49,980
In the future,

528
00:27:50,460 --> 00:27:51,820
follow Mr. Feng well.

529
00:27:52,900 --> 00:27:53,700
Mr. Feng,

530
00:27:53,780 --> 00:27:55,140
this, thank you.

531
00:27:56,140 --> 00:27:57,060
Give me the car keys.

532
00:27:57,260 --> 00:27:58,540
Sis, the car is over there.

533
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:07,460
How long have you been following Dao Jian?

534
00:28:07,780 --> 00:28:08,460
I?

535
00:28:08,780 --> 00:28:10,820
I've been with Brother Dao Jian for quite a long time.

536
00:28:11,100 --> 00:28:12,500
What kind of person is he?

537
00:28:12,620 --> 00:28:14,220
There's nothing I can say about Brother Dao Jian,

538
00:28:14,220 --> 00:28:15,740
he is very good to his men.

539
00:28:29,460 --> 00:28:30,540
Why do I hear?

540
00:28:30,540 --> 00:28:31,940
different from what you said?

541
00:28:34,100 --> 00:28:35,580
I heard, he's someone who

542
00:28:35,580 --> 00:28:36,820
not good?

543
00:28:38,060 --> 00:28:39,460
Following the boss like this,

544
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,300
not afraid that one day he will betray you,

545
00:28:41,300 --> 00:28:42,420
and cost you your life?

546
00:28:44,740 --> 00:28:45,420
Bos,

547
00:28:46,460 --> 00:28:47,660
Being afraid is also useless.

548
00:28:47,660 --> 00:28:49,220
We as men,

549
00:28:49,380 --> 00:28:50,940
how can you choose your own boss?

550
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:51,700
Who do we follow?

551
00:28:51,700 --> 00:28:52,780
Nor am I the one who decides.

552
00:28:52,780 --> 00:28:54,020
This is also not ordering food.

553
00:28:56,260 --> 00:28:57,100
Life...

554
00:28:57,260 --> 00:28:58,740
actually just a bet.

555
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:01,780
For me, winning or losing doesn't matter.

556
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,220
After all, I have nothing to fear,

557
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:04,060
my life is also worthless.

558
00:29:05,060 --> 00:29:06,060
That's right, right, Boss?

559
00:29:08,620 --> 00:29:09,700
What are you doing?

560
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:14,100
Wu, 'can?

561
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:16,620
I like you.

562
00:29:17,940 --> 00:29:19,100
Get on, you drive.

563
00:29:34,300 --> 00:29:36,060
Who arranged this seating?

564
00:29:45,940 --> 00:29:46,820
Off you go.

565
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:48,420
Good.

566
00:29:56,220 --> 00:29:57,020
Boss, ask a moment,

567
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,460
how to start this car?

568
00:30:01,700 --> 00:30:02,620
Step on the pedal.

569
00:30:03,900 --> 00:30:04,780
Step on the pedal.

570
00:30:14,540 --> 00:30:15,380
Thank You.

571
00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:23,340
Bu Ke.

572
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:30,420
Mrs. Ke, have you come?

573
00:30:31,420 --> 00:30:32,580
You're fine, right?

574
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,180
I'm fine,

575
00:30:34,180 --> 00:30:35,220
just slightly injured.

576
00:30:35,700 --> 00:30:36,700
That's good then.

577
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:38,820
It is true,

578
00:30:38,820 --> 00:30:39,940
electric motorbike riders now

579
00:30:39,940 --> 00:30:41,060
really annoying

580
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:42,620
Everyone rides it fast,

581
00:30:42,620 --> 00:30:43,540
and ride it on the road,

582
00:30:43,540 --> 00:30:44,260
break through at will.

583
00:30:44,260 --> 00:30:44,900
Correct.

584
00:30:44,980 --> 00:30:46,780
No matter whether you walk or take a car,

585
00:30:46,780 --> 00:30:48,140
it still scares you.

586
00:30:48,140 --> 00:30:48,820
Our country too

587
00:30:48,820 --> 00:30:49,940
does not issue rules

588
00:30:49,940 --> 00:30:50,660
to take care of it.

589
00:30:50,660 --> 00:30:51,780
- Be... - Report.

590
00:30:52,580 --> 00:30:53,860
This is an assignment from a previous class.

591
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,660
You...

592
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,300
Go to class.

593
00:31:03,820 --> 00:31:04,620
See you, ma'am.

594
00:31:14,780 --> 00:31:17,100
(Lian Damao)

595
00:31:19,860 --> 00:31:20,620
Halo.

596
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:22,820
Throw your Yang Yuze

597
00:31:22,820 --> 00:31:24,220
and come into my arms.

598
00:31:26,420 --> 00:31:27,220
You'll come straight later

599
00:31:27,220 --> 00:31:28,060
send the documents

600
00:31:28,060 --> 00:31:28,620
just go to my email.

601
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,740
Okay.

602
00:31:30,100 --> 00:31:31,100
Thank You.

603
00:31:31,220 --> 00:31:31,940
See you soon.

604
00:31:32,820 --> 00:31:34,060
Miss Lian, what do you drink today?

605
00:31:34,060 --> 00:31:34,700
As usual.

606
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:35,820
Okay, wait a minute.

607
00:31:41,180 --> 00:31:43,100
Why don't you sit in your usual place today?

608
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,060
You're getting thinner.

609
00:31:46,060 --> 00:31:47,300
Because you miss me, huh?

610
00:31:50,780 --> 00:31:51,900
When are you coming back?

611
00:31:51,900 --> 00:31:52,740
Just arrived today.

612
00:31:52,940 --> 00:31:54,340
Once you have finished reporting work to your superior,

613
00:31:54,340 --> 00:31:55,580
immediately came looking for you.

614
00:31:55,780 --> 00:31:57,100
Even an invitation from Handsome Qiao

615
00:31:57,100 --> 00:31:58,140
I also refuse.

616
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,980
If in terms of loyalty, friends,

617
00:31:59,980 --> 00:32:01,300
I must be first class, right?

618
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:04,340
The look on your face is not very good.

619
00:32:04,780 --> 00:32:06,460
Even though I'm dressed up, I can still see it.

620
00:32:07,740 --> 00:32:09,100
Is your insomnia still not getting better?

621
00:32:11,540 --> 00:32:13,100
Still because of the previous incident?

622
00:32:17,060 --> 00:32:18,300
How was your inspection?

623
00:32:18,300 --> 00:32:19,340
Have there been any results?

624
00:32:19,540 --> 00:32:20,900
I've helped you check the documents,

625
00:32:21,300 --> 00:32:22,340
and I'll bring it to you.

626
00:32:22,940 --> 00:32:23,900
Very good.

627
00:32:23,900 --> 00:32:25,460
I just wanted to discuss this matter with you.

628
00:32:25,660 --> 00:32:26,580
You don't need to worry,

629
00:32:26,700 --> 00:32:27,340
this time,

630
00:32:27,340 --> 00:32:29,300
could definitely be made into a film.

631
00:32:29,860 --> 00:32:30,580
At first,

632
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:31,460
no problem,

633
00:32:31,460 --> 00:32:32,700
absolutely no news.

634
00:32:32,940 --> 00:32:33,900
However, when we investigated

635
00:32:33,900 --> 00:32:35,460
information inside Chunhui Steel Industry,

636
00:32:35,460 --> 00:32:36,900
these people can't keep calm.

637
00:32:37,340 --> 00:32:38,740
Originally surnamed Luo,

638
00:32:38,740 --> 00:32:39,780
destroyed his car.

639
00:32:39,780 --> 00:32:40,420
Then, put a stack

640
00:32:40,420 --> 00:32:41,780
dead mice in it.

641
00:32:42,300 --> 00:32:43,740
The one surnamed Luo was really scared.

642
00:32:43,940 --> 00:32:44,980
I even advised him,

643
00:32:44,980 --> 00:32:46,340
I said, you don't need to be afraid,

644
00:32:46,580 --> 00:32:47,900
but instead he shouted at me.

645
00:32:48,060 --> 00:32:48,780
He says,

646
00:32:48,780 --> 00:32:50,140
"You are the daughter of the deputy mayor,

647
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:51,700
Of course there's no need to be afraid."

648
00:32:52,860 --> 00:32:54,260
So what if it's the deputy mayor's daughter?

649
00:32:54,620 --> 00:32:55,380
Not the deputy mayor's daughter

650
00:32:55,380 --> 00:32:56,620
also being followed by people,

651
00:32:56,620 --> 00:32:57,220
and almost pushed

652
00:32:57,220 --> 00:32:58,820
under the vehicle tire.

653
00:33:00,740 --> 00:33:01,900
Is someone taking revenge on you?

654
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:05,020
It's okay, I can deal with it.

655
00:33:05,020 --> 00:33:06,140
However, this time,

656
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:07,820
Luckily there is Handsome Qiao.

657
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:08,820
- If he wasn't there... - Excuse me.

658
00:33:09,020 --> 00:33:10,140
- Please. - Thank You.

659
00:33:10,380 --> 00:33:11,020
I really don't know

660
00:33:11,020 --> 00:33:11,980
What to do.

661
00:33:13,380 --> 00:33:15,860
This kid is quite brave too.

662
00:33:16,060 --> 00:33:17,580
I may have misunderstood him before,

663
00:33:17,740 --> 00:33:18,500
consider it

664
00:33:18,500 --> 00:33:20,500
an empty head that can only lick.

665
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:22,780
Maksudmu Qiao Yu

666
00:33:22,780 --> 00:33:23,540
which is always the case

667
00:33:23,540 --> 00:33:24,700
against you?

668
00:33:25,420 --> 00:33:26,260
Correct.

669
00:33:26,780 --> 00:33:28,380
This time, luckily he was there.

670
00:33:29,180 --> 00:33:30,460
this child,

671
00:33:30,860 --> 00:33:31,980
not only brave,

672
00:33:31,980 --> 00:33:33,220
he's also quite intelligent.

673
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:34,180
Nobody can

674
00:33:34,180 --> 00:33:34,980
hidden from him.

675
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,460
Today I still talk about it.

676
00:33:36,460 --> 00:33:37,980
I said, he has a dog's nose,

677
00:33:38,100 --> 00:33:39,980
it would be a shame not to be a paparazzi.

678
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:45,700
Oh, yeah, didn't you say

679
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:47,340
Is there a big problem you want to tell me?

680
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:48,940
What problem?

681
00:33:51,500 --> 00:33:52,100
Ke Ying?

682
00:33:57,620 --> 00:33:58,300
Ke Ying.

683
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:01,180
I'm asking you.

684
00:34:02,660 --> 00:34:03,980
You... what did you say?

685
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,100
Come on, Money Boss.

686
00:34:14,660 --> 00:34:15,460
Cheers to you.

687
00:34:29,100 --> 00:34:30,060
Today is a great opportunity.

688
00:35:09,700 --> 00:35:10,500
Forest Zhang.

689
00:35:11,620 --> 00:35:12,420
Drink again.

690
00:35:13,100 --> 00:35:13,780
Don't want any more.

691
00:35:14,460 --> 00:35:15,260
Drink another glass.

692
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,140
Mari.

693
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:22,980
Come, come, come, over here.

694
00:35:31,340 --> 00:35:32,140
Come on, Boss Zhang.

695
00:35:32,140 --> 00:35:32,900
We're over here.

696
00:35:33,060 --> 00:35:34,180
Let's go.

697
00:35:39,580 --> 00:35:40,140
Ayo.

698
00:35:42,660 --> 00:35:43,980
I'll get you a beer.

699
00:35:49,660 --> 00:35:51,420
Boss Zhang, let's have another drink.

700
00:35:52,500 --> 00:35:53,500
Forest Zhang?

701
00:35:55,260 --> 00:35:56,180
Forest Zhang?

702
00:35:57,460 --> 00:35:58,500
Forest Zhang?

703
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,140
Mrs. Ke, where is Boss Zhang?

704
00:37:06,700 --> 00:37:07,740
Shen Shijie,

705
00:37:08,900 --> 00:37:10,380
don't overdo it.

706
00:37:10,500 --> 00:37:11,820
You really hate me, don't you?

707
00:37:12,900 --> 00:37:14,500
Then, try to hate me well.

708
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:03,580
Where is Boss Zhang?

709
00:38:06,420 --> 00:38:07,500
It just came out.

710
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:09,180
Didn't you see it?

711
00:38:32,140 --> 00:38:33,700
Bu Ke is great, yes.

712
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:38,580
That man from earlier

713
00:38:38,580 --> 00:38:39,900
definitely interested in you.

714
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:41,340
Don't be careless.

715
00:38:41,340 --> 00:38:42,660
It's not that I'm exaggerating,

716
00:38:42,940 --> 00:38:43,660
I even feel

717
00:38:43,660 --> 00:38:44,940
he was a little serious.

718
00:38:45,340 --> 00:38:46,100
Where there are people who

719
00:38:46,100 --> 00:38:47,460
came to the party, but still so serious?

720
00:38:47,580 --> 00:38:48,380
Correct.

721
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:49,460
Men like this

722
00:38:49,460 --> 00:38:50,580
could not be found

723
00:38:50,580 --> 00:38:51,500
in a place like this.

724
00:38:52,500 --> 00:38:53,980
You should be grateful, you know?

725
00:38:54,300 --> 00:38:55,220
Men like this

726
00:38:55,220 --> 00:38:56,500
very rare.

727
00:38:56,940 --> 00:38:57,740
Besides that...

728
00:38:57,740 --> 00:38:58,580
Nona Shen,

729
00:38:58,820 --> 00:39:00,140
hang on a moment,

730
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,220
I'll call the doctor.

731
00:39:09,580 --> 00:39:10,500
What is it?

732
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,420
What happened?

733
00:39:27,860 --> 00:39:28,940
What is this?

734
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:30,380
My goodness.

735
00:40:27,220 --> 00:40:35,340
(Buchuo Antique Museum)

736
00:41:03,380 --> 00:41:05,100
We've checked Dao Jian's phone,

737
00:41:05,300 --> 00:41:06,500
there are no photos inside.

738
00:41:07,940 --> 00:41:09,300
The thug who became the scapegoat

739
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,220
give his name.

740
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:12,820
We have also arrested him and are interrogating him.

741
00:41:13,380 --> 00:41:14,260
Useless.

742
00:41:14,980 --> 00:41:16,820
It has absolutely nothing to do with Dao Jian.

743
00:41:17,420 --> 00:41:19,580
So, you guys just gave up Dao Jian like that?

744
00:41:20,980 --> 00:41:23,060
Pretend nothing ever happened?

745
00:41:24,020 --> 00:41:26,380
Received illicit money from the Feng Group,

746
00:41:27,100 --> 00:41:28,940
then conspired with them?

747
00:41:30,580 --> 00:41:31,740
If so, what else can you do?

748
00:41:32,460 --> 00:41:33,620
Just arrest him and immediately punish him?

749
00:41:34,260 --> 00:41:35,340
Do you have any proof?

750
00:41:36,220 --> 00:41:37,420
I am the proof,

751
00:41:37,420 --> 00:41:40,020
I saw with my own eyes him killing people!

752
00:41:43,820 --> 00:41:45,300
Did you see that person's face?

753
00:42:04,900 --> 00:42:05,980
You're there at all

754
00:42:05,980 --> 00:42:07,900
did not see Dao Jian's face.

755
00:42:09,380 --> 00:42:10,260
To be honest,

756
00:42:11,580 --> 00:42:13,220
suspicious of you too

757
00:42:13,220 --> 00:42:14,500
still not gone.

758
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,500
Suspicion of me?

759
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:19,780
What suspicion?

760
00:42:19,780 --> 00:42:20,780
Kill Uncle Chen?

761
00:42:21,500 --> 00:42:22,420
Correct.

762
00:42:22,540 --> 00:42:23,580
You're the one calling,

763
00:42:23,580 --> 00:42:24,860
You made a promise to him.

764
00:42:25,740 --> 00:42:27,740
Even though you're Chen's informant,

765
00:42:28,060 --> 00:42:29,820
but this is not your own wish.

766
00:42:30,380 --> 00:42:31,300
Chen promised to

767
00:42:31,300 --> 00:42:33,060
help you find your biological parents,

768
00:42:33,180 --> 00:42:35,100
but he keeps not giving you news.

769
00:42:35,580 --> 00:42:36,540
So,

770
00:42:37,380 --> 00:42:38,980
you harbor hatred,

771
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,340
giving rise to hidden motives.

772
00:42:41,460 --> 00:42:42,340
No!

773
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:53,260
How could I kill?

774
00:42:53,820 --> 00:42:55,700
How could I kill Uncle Chen?

775
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:04,060
I know you weren't the one who killed him,

776
00:43:07,460 --> 00:43:09,660
because I believe in Chen's judgment.

777
00:43:15,060 --> 00:43:16,460
So, what are you going to do now?

778
00:43:16,740 --> 00:43:20,500
You guys can't do anything to Dao Jian?

779
00:43:22,340 --> 00:43:23,340
Dao Jian is nothing more than that

780
00:43:23,340 --> 00:43:24,660
just a murder knife.

781
00:43:25,820 --> 00:43:27,180
What we have to do now,

782
00:43:27,340 --> 00:43:28,340
not just

783
00:43:28,340 --> 00:43:29,820
get this murder knife,

784
00:43:30,500 --> 00:43:33,140
but also want to cut off the hand holding the knife,

785
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:34,780
bring out the real culprit

786
00:43:34,780 --> 00:43:36,260
who hides behind

787
00:43:36,260 --> 00:43:38,140
Making him feel legal sanctions.

788
00:43:39,660 --> 00:43:41,740
Chen always calls you Wu, right?

789
00:43:43,180 --> 00:43:44,380
Everyone calls me Wu.

790
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:46,340
