=Episode 22=

3
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:34,810
Jin.

4
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:35,450
You've come.

5
00:01:36,850 --> 00:01:37,610
Wu,

6
00:01:37,890 --> 00:01:38,810
Say hello to Sis Jin.

7
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:39,970
Kak Jin

8
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:42,090
Qiang.

9
00:01:42,850 --> 00:01:44,810
Why bring beginners here?

10
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:46,730
Beginner?

11
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:48,530
Beginner.

12
00:01:49,090 --> 00:01:50,450
Jin.

13
00:01:51,250 --> 00:01:52,090
Come on, come on.

14
00:01:52,090 --> 00:01:55,130
This beginner is my most competent man.

15
00:01:56,930 --> 00:01:57,730
it's you,

16
00:01:57,890 --> 00:01:59,450
affairs specifically entrusted by the boss,

17
00:01:59,450 --> 00:02:00,690
can I do it haphazardly?

18
00:02:08,210 --> 00:02:09,930
Come on, buddy, let's go.

19
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:23,770
These are all fancy dishes,

20
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:24,730
less fit to drink with this.

21
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:25,970
Open that, open that.

22
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:26,490
Mari.

23
00:02:26,810 --> 00:02:27,690
This is good.

24
00:02:28,370 --> 00:02:28,970
Bos.

25
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,570
I said something, yeah.

26
00:02:33,610 --> 00:02:34,770
Smuggling this time

27
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:36,450
only involves a few of us, yes.

28
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:37,930
Let's get to know each other,

29
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:39,370
you guys call him Sis Qiang.

30
00:02:39,970 --> 00:02:40,890
Kak Qiang.

31
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:41,930
Just call me Queban.

32
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:43,370
Kak Qiang, Namaku Guo Bao.

33
00:02:43,370 --> 00:02:44,290
Fine, fine, fine.

34
00:02:45,530 --> 00:02:46,370
I'm Wu.

35
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:50,610
Before we do the smuggling,

36
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:52,930
we live in this house.

37
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:54,530
No matter what business there is,

38
00:02:54,650 --> 00:02:55,970
no one can leave.

39
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:56,890
Understand?

40
00:02:57,170 --> 00:02:57,890
- Understand. - Understand.

41
00:02:57,890 --> 00:02:58,450
Understand.

42
00:03:01,810 --> 00:03:02,650
Jin.

43
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:04,650
When do we ship?

44
00:03:04,650 --> 00:03:06,650
Don't lock us up too long, yeah.

45
00:03:08,930 --> 00:03:10,250
I don't know.

46
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:11,970
We are all the same,

47
00:03:12,490 --> 00:03:13,410
we are waiting for the call.

48
00:03:16,730 --> 00:03:17,410
Qiang.

49
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,850
We both haven't had a drink in a while, right?

50
00:03:20,490 --> 00:03:21,330
Let's have a toast.

51
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:23,610
The beer's not bad, isn't it?

52
00:03:23,610 --> 00:03:24,810
Come on, cheers.

53
00:03:24,810 --> 00:03:25,330
Mari.

54
00:03:25,330 --> 00:03:26,130
Friends, let's toast.

55
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:28,450
Everyone works hard, yeah.

56
00:03:45,930 --> 00:03:47,050
Look at the color of this car.

57
00:03:48,050 --> 00:03:48,930
The model is good.

58
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,890
Correct.

59
00:03:50,690 --> 00:03:51,650
Not bad, not bad.

60
00:03:51,650 --> 00:03:53,290
This car is our flagship series.

61
00:03:53,890 --> 00:03:54,610
We are also looking forward to it.

62
00:03:55,130 --> 00:03:56,810
We believe this car will be a big seller.

63
00:03:56,810 --> 00:03:57,610
It's good indeed.

64
00:03:58,330 --> 00:03:58,850
Correct.

65
00:03:59,050 --> 00:04:00,130
The longer the better.

66
00:04:00,370 --> 00:04:01,010
Look at it.

67
00:04:02,810 --> 00:04:04,010
There are too many people here.

68
00:04:06,130 --> 00:04:07,330
What is this?

69
00:04:07,810 --> 00:04:09,810
I heard earlier that some people have even raised prices and are selling queue numbers.

70
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:12,610
According to you,

71
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:15,690
is the car really that good?

72
00:04:16,610 --> 00:04:17,730
The car is good or not,

73
00:04:17,730 --> 00:04:18,890
I'm not very clear.

74
00:04:19,330 --> 00:04:20,530
However, the car has not been released yet,

75
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,770
even if the car expert comes,

76
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:23,130
they also can't see the problem.

77
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:26,250
Just looking at the official data released,

78
00:04:26,370 --> 00:04:27,890
it really amazes people.

79
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:29,650
For example, this charging technology,

80
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:31,130
can be fully charged in five minutes.

81
00:04:31,130 --> 00:04:32,730
The battery will not degrade.

82
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,810
Tesla will also go crazy, this car is number one in the world.

83
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:40,290
This car model is quite good.

84
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:42,930
(Aoxin)

85
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:48,530
Manager Liu.

86
00:04:49,290 --> 00:04:50,690
Miss Ke wants to buy a car,

87
00:04:50,690 --> 00:04:51,970
do you have to wait three months?

88
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:53,530
Really sorry.

89
00:04:53,970 --> 00:04:54,610
Miss Ke,

90
00:04:54,970 --> 00:04:56,410
our order was really too much.

91
00:04:56,410 --> 00:04:57,770
I'll try to be available early,

92
00:04:57,770 --> 00:04:59,290
but I can't guarantee when.

93
00:04:59,810 --> 00:05:01,690
Best charging technology

94
00:05:01,690 --> 00:05:03,650
which exists today

95
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,530
also need 75 minutes.

96
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:07,090
Seventy-five minutes?

97
00:05:07,090 --> 00:05:09,530
Seventy-five minutes versus five minutes.

98
00:05:09,690 --> 00:05:12,010
What's more, achieved in two years.

99
00:05:13,330 --> 00:05:14,690
Still not suspicious?

100
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:19,290
I understand.

101
00:05:20,170 --> 00:05:21,610
This is fake.

102
00:05:21,610 --> 00:05:23,810
This car's technology is fake, right?

103
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:26,410
That's all I have to do.

104
00:05:26,850 --> 00:05:28,250
How much down payment do I have to pay?

105
00:05:28,250 --> 00:05:29,570
If you are, there's no need.

106
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:31,210
How can that be?

107
00:05:31,210 --> 00:05:32,770
Doesn't everyone have to pay a down payment?

108
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:34,970
The company does determine this before taking the car

109
00:05:34,970 --> 00:05:36,250
must pay a down payment of 50 thousand.

110
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:37,290
However, you don't need to.

111
00:05:37,290 --> 00:05:38,930
Providing the car faster is not my job,

112
00:05:38,930 --> 00:05:41,970
but regarding your down payment, I can still make a decision.

113
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:44,810
However, if this is fake,

114
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:47,290
wouldn't it be exposed as soon as the car was released?

115
00:05:47,370 --> 00:05:49,770
How to cover up a lie this big?

116
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:54,610
Pretty good.

117
00:05:54,650 --> 00:05:55,170
Mr. Liu.

118
00:05:55,170 --> 00:05:57,330
Distributor from Shandong would like to meet you.

119
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:58,530
What do you think?

120
00:06:00,730 --> 00:06:02,810
If so, we won't bother you anymore, you get busy.

121
00:06:02,810 --> 00:06:04,090
I'll treat you another time.

122
00:06:04,330 --> 00:06:05,090
OK, Miss Ke.

123
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:05,810
Then, I'm not taking you.

124
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:06,570
Be careful on the way.

125
00:06:06,730 --> 00:06:07,490
Thank You.

126
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:09,210
Hello, please.

127
00:06:11,490 --> 00:06:12,090
Halo.

128
00:06:12,650 --> 00:06:13,450
Sister Ke.

129
00:06:13,930 --> 00:06:15,930
If you want to buy a car, you don't need to come here.

130
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:18,010
If I tell Mr. Xu,

131
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:19,850
he will definitely order it for you.

132
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:20,930
you come here,

133
00:06:21,130 --> 00:06:22,570
instead it made Liu Li even busier.

134
00:06:22,770 --> 00:06:24,090
If I don't come see for myself,

135
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:26,050
I really didn't expect this car to be so popular.

136
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:28,450
The sales are indeed good.

137
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:30,410
This is also offline sales only,

138
00:06:30,410 --> 00:06:32,810
I heard, there are more people ordering online.

139
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:34,330
Previously, chairman of the board of directors

140
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:36,330
I've spent a lot of money on advertising.

141
00:06:36,650 --> 00:06:39,570
Everyone knows about our new energy cars.

142
00:06:46,650 --> 00:06:47,930
Who's he?

143
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:49,770
So?

144
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:51,890
He's the technology supervisor on the American side,

145
00:06:51,890 --> 00:06:52,570
David.

146
00:06:53,330 --> 00:06:54,930
He is responsible for all communications

147
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:57,170
between our company and American companies.

148
00:06:57,170 --> 00:06:58,250
Really understand China.

149
00:06:58,250 --> 00:07:01,930
His Mandarin is even more fluent than mine.

150
00:07:02,290 --> 00:07:03,370
However,

151
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:05,370
this foreigner...

152
00:07:07,370 --> 00:07:08,530
Why?

153
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:11,610
It's hard to say.

154
00:07:16,410 --> 00:07:17,650
Are you familiar with him?

155
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:19,010
I?

156
00:07:20,090 --> 00:07:21,650
I'm not familiar with him.

157
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:38,050
(Amazing Acceleration Performance)

158
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:41,410
It is such a coincidence.

159
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:43,410
You also came to see the car?

160
00:07:44,890 --> 00:07:45,890
Just looking around.

161
00:07:47,610 --> 00:07:48,930
This car is quite good,

162
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:50,690
just have to wait three months.

163
00:07:50,690 --> 00:07:51,810
I'm waiting in line too.

164
00:07:55,410 --> 00:07:57,930
Madam Chairman of the Board of Directors, you think too much.

165
00:07:58,170 --> 00:08:00,770
I have no intention of buying a car through your connections.

166
00:08:02,290 --> 00:08:03,210
However,

167
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,410
unmarketed cars,

168
00:08:06,410 --> 00:08:08,290
it's been blown out of proportion to this.

169
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,810
Your fiancé is quite great, huh.

170
00:08:15,330 --> 00:08:16,090
Correct.

171
00:08:17,690 --> 00:08:19,610
Selling too much is also a problem.

172
00:08:20,610 --> 00:08:21,930
Too many orders,

173
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:24,810
I'm afraid the factory...

174
00:08:28,570 --> 00:08:30,170
You are busy first, I still have business.

175
00:08:42,490 --> 00:08:43,730
The one who spoke to you earlier

176
00:08:43,730 --> 00:08:45,650
is Feng Xiaosheng's fiancee, right?

177
00:08:46,370 --> 00:08:48,210
It's always been in the news lately.

178
00:08:49,650 --> 00:08:50,530
(Correct.)

179
00:08:50,930 --> 00:08:52,690
(Overselling is also a problem.)

180
00:08:52,930 --> 00:08:54,410
Too many orders,

181
00:08:56,690 --> 00:08:58,370
I'm afraid the factory...

182
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:06,610
Where are you going?

183
00:09:07,570 --> 00:09:08,970
Confirmed my guess.

184
00:09:08,970 --> 00:09:09,690
Come with me.

185
00:09:10,090 --> 00:09:10,770
Not...

186
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:17,970
It seems like you were a bit distant from him earlier.

187
00:09:17,970 --> 00:09:20,050
You don't like that David?

188
00:09:22,290 --> 00:09:23,730
In that case, I will be frank with you.

189
00:09:24,210 --> 00:09:25,530
That stranger

190
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:27,850
what a bastard man.

191
00:09:29,290 --> 00:09:30,090
Fuck?

192
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:31,890
Why?

193
00:09:31,890 --> 00:09:33,210
I see he's pretty neat.

194
00:09:35,450 --> 00:09:36,810
Just the outer appearance.

195
00:09:37,050 --> 00:09:39,050
Otherwise, how to deceive people?

196
00:09:45,250 --> 00:09:46,010
Sister Ke.

197
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:51,210
What girls brains are now all off, huh?

198
00:09:51,850 --> 00:09:53,450
Just given a few sweet words,

199
00:09:53,570 --> 00:09:55,210
still don't know anything,

200
00:09:55,210 --> 00:09:56,730
directly tricked into sleeping with him.

201
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,890
In our company, there really are girls who fall for their words?

202
00:10:01,930 --> 00:10:03,850
Not just one.

203
00:10:05,650 --> 00:10:06,770
Let me tell you,

204
00:10:06,770 --> 00:10:09,250
after sleeping with them, I don't even remember their names.

205
00:10:09,250 --> 00:10:10,770
According to you, isn't he a jerk?

206
00:10:12,410 --> 00:10:14,290
Then, everyone lets him do as he pleases?

207
00:10:16,170 --> 00:10:17,570
What can be done?

208
00:10:17,570 --> 00:10:19,970
The company treated him like a golden child,

209
00:10:20,210 --> 00:10:22,050
even his cell phone number is kept secret.

210
00:10:23,690 --> 00:10:24,890
Let me tell you,

211
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:29,770
his name wasn't even in the company contact book.

212
00:10:49,370 --> 00:10:50,770
Fine, I understand.

213
00:11:07,970 --> 00:11:09,330
The wind is very comfortable.

214
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:10,010
Correct.

215
00:11:11,010 --> 00:11:12,290
I really like.

216
00:11:12,290 --> 00:11:13,370
Like it, right?

217
00:11:15,130 --> 00:11:16,130
Come on, look here.

218
00:11:16,930 --> 00:11:18,250
- Smile. - Cheese!

219
00:12:05,810 --> 00:12:07,010
This is what I found.

220
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:15,330
(Living expenses for Loushan Village orphans; Shen Shijie)

221
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:18,930
I think there's something strange

222
00:12:19,090 --> 00:12:20,730
about Jie's problem.

223
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:24,330
While investigating Jie's files,

224
00:12:24,330 --> 00:12:25,570
I also looked at mine.

225
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:27,690
There are absolutely no files.

226
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:33,700
Also, files from all the children in our class

227
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:35,050
also no longer there.

228
00:12:37,370 --> 00:12:38,410
I also found that

229
00:12:38,410 --> 00:12:40,330
because of the demolition of the orphanage ten years ago,

230
00:12:40,330 --> 00:12:42,010
a lot of data was lost.

231
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:46,010
However, why are only Jie's files still complete?

232
00:12:50,890 --> 00:12:51,890
No need to investigate any further.

233
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:53,250
More or less the same as I thought.

234
00:12:54,530 --> 00:12:55,730
I just want to make sure.

Buy two ships with this money.

237
00:13:08,130 --> 00:13:10,050
We don't have much time anymore.

238
00:13:11,930 --> 00:13:14,170
Got it, I'll do it right away.

239
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:18,530
Halo.

Do you have contact information for David, the American?

241
00:13:22,730 --> 00:13:23,850
David who?

242
00:13:25,650 --> 00:13:27,330
Forget it, I'll just find my own way.

245
00:14:46,530 --> 00:14:47,330
Hello, sir.

246
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:47,970
We are...

247
00:14:48,850 --> 00:14:50,250
Nanzhou Financial Daily reporter.

248
00:14:50,650 --> 00:14:51,210
today,

249
00:14:51,530 --> 00:14:53,290
I've made an interview appointment

250
00:14:53,410 --> 00:14:54,330
with the manager here.

251
00:14:54,690 --> 00:14:55,250
Manager?

252
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,410
Which manager?

253
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:03,770
Money Manager.

254
00:15:06,890 --> 00:15:08,130
Money Manager?

255
00:15:09,170 --> 00:15:09,890
It's just here

256
00:15:09,890 --> 00:15:11,930
whose surnames are Chen and Li,

257
00:15:12,570 --> 00:15:13,970
there is no Manager Wang.

258
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:15,850
That,

259
00:15:16,050 --> 00:15:16,890
I mean Manager Li.

260
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,410
I just remembered wrongly.

261
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:19,650
Manager Li, Manager Li.

262
00:15:19,730 --> 00:15:20,970
We made an appointment with Manager Li.

263
00:15:21,770 --> 00:15:23,290
Manager Li didn't come to work today.

264
00:15:24,530 --> 00:15:25,130
What if,

265
00:15:25,250 --> 00:15:25,850
we

266
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:27,290
wait a minute here?

267
00:15:31,010 --> 00:15:33,290
This factory is very famous.

268
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:36,090
Usually there would be lots of reporters coming for interviews, right?

269
00:15:36,650 --> 00:15:37,170
There isn't any.

270
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:38,850
Doesn't allow interviews.

271
00:15:39,530 --> 00:15:42,970
Be it a television station or a news agency,

272
00:15:43,410 --> 00:15:44,810
not all can do interviews.

273
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,610
Just be honest,

274
00:15:50,570 --> 00:15:52,330
Manager Li is no longer at work

275
00:15:52,330 --> 00:15:53,690
for half a month.

276
00:15:54,330 --> 00:15:56,850
Even if you wait, it's in vain.

277
00:15:59,890 --> 00:16:02,170
He really didn't keep his word.

278
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,410
Previously we had agreed

279
00:16:04,770 --> 00:16:05,890
will come to interview him.

280
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,250
He hasn't come to work for half a month,

281
00:16:08,530 --> 00:16:10,290
but didn't tell us.

282

285
00:16:16,290 --> 00:16:18,890
Our editor-in-chief has given us orders,

286
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:20,130
if we come here,

287
00:16:20,210 --> 00:16:21,970
but didn't take some good photos here,

288
00:16:22,370 --> 00:16:23,250
then we have nothing to report.

289
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:26,330
You give us a clue

290
00:16:26,570 --> 00:16:29,130
about when is the best time for us to come here.

291
00:16:30,330 --> 00:16:33,210
Then, you guys just wait when the higher ups come for inspection,

292
00:16:33,330 --> 00:16:34,330
it must be busy at that time.

293
00:16:35,450 --> 00:16:37,170
If you come on a weekday,

294
00:16:37,290 --> 00:16:38,290
all the same,

Not a single bird, cat or dog.

Okay.

298
00:16:47,450 --> 00:16:48,610
Thank you sir.

299

You're welcome, you're welcome.

300
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:51,930
Then, please come back.

301
00:16:51,930 --> 00:16:53,490
Okay, thank you.

302
00:16:53,490 --> 00:16:54,570
OK, thank you sir.

What do you see?

314
00:17:45,290 --> 00:17:46,770
How did you get here?

315
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:48,850
Which one is David?

316
00:17:48,850 --> 00:17:50,330
Why do you want his contact?

317
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:55,170
There is.

318
00:17:55,410 --> 00:17:56,810
Here is a detailed explanation.

319
00:17:56,810 --> 00:17:59,690
He holds the core technology of the Aoxin project.

320
00:18:00,850 --> 00:18:02,010
So, you mean

321
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:04,490
can verify the correctness of the project through him?

322
00:18:04,490 --> 00:18:05,290
Most likely.

323
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:07,330
The biggest selling point of this project is the technology.

324
00:18:07,490 --> 00:18:09,090
The company treated him like a golden child,

325
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:11,970
His cellphone number was kept secret from internal staff.

326
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:13,090
Secret?

327
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,850
Let me ask An for his contact.

328
00:18:15,850 --> 00:18:16,570
Wait.

329
00:18:17,210 --> 00:18:19,330
If I could ask for it from An, I would have done it earlier.

330

I, the chairman of the board of directors,

331
00:18:21,210 --> 00:18:22,770
Can't get the employee's phone number?

332
00:18:22,770 --> 00:18:24,010
Just for one phone number,

333
00:18:24,330 --> 00:18:25,850
do you want to make the enemy alert?

334
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,130

Liu Li.

336
00:18:51,130 --> 00:18:52,130
What can he do?

337
00:19:00,330 --> 00:19:01,530
Help me step on it.

338
00:19:02,330 --> 00:19:03,170
What do you want to do?

339
00:19:03,170 --> 00:19:04,570
I told you to step on it, yes, just step on it.

340
00:19:18,530 --> 00:19:19,490
Is it?

341
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:21,330
I'll call you later.

346
00:19:47,130 --> 00:19:48,210
Don't bring it up again.

347
00:19:49,050 --> 00:19:49,970
Look at my cell phone,

348
00:19:49,970 --> 00:19:51,130
fell like this.

349
00:19:51,530 --> 00:19:53,570
Initially I had promised a friend to go for a walk.

350
00:19:55,050 --> 00:19:56,610
Now they can't even call them.

351
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:58,850
Then, use my cell phone.

352
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:01,370
This... I don't feel good.

353
00:20:01,570 --> 00:20:02,090
No problem.

354
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:03,090
Do not hesitate.

355
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,770
If that's the case, I'll use it, okay?

356
00:20:17,210 --> 00:20:18,130
Halo.

357
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:19,850
Hello, it's me.

358
00:20:19,850 --> 00:20:21,330
My cell phone is broken.

359
00:20:22,010 --> 00:20:23,450
Now I use

360
00:20:23,690 --> 00:20:25,770
Manager Liu's cell phone from the Marketing Department.

361
00:20:26,010 --> 00:20:27,250
Where have you been?

362
00:20:29,010 --> 00:20:30,250
You've arrived, haven't you?

363
00:20:30,450 --> 00:20:31,650
I'm on the first floor,

364
00:20:31,650 --> 00:20:32,970
in the food area.

365
00:20:33,050 --> 00:20:34,050
Here.

366
00:20:37,730 --> 00:20:38,290
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

367
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:40,370
Liu Li, 'kan?

368
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:41,570
I know about you.

369
00:20:41,970 --> 00:20:43,170
Nice to meet you, Chairman of the Board of Directors.

370
00:20:45,090 --> 00:20:46,770
I went to see the exhibition earlier,

371
00:20:46,850 --> 00:20:47,730
the decoration is very nice.

372
00:20:47,730 --> 00:20:48,490
You've worked hard.

373
00:20:48,930 --> 00:20:49,570
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

374
00:20:49,770 --> 00:20:51,130
that's our job.

375
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:52,610
(David) Can get recognition from you,

376
00:20:52,610 --> 00:20:53,810
more tired also matches.

377
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:57,810
Manager Liu.

378
00:20:58,250 --> 00:20:59,330
Thanks for the phone.

379
00:21:00,010 --> 00:21:00,970
You're welcome.

380
00:21:01,130 --> 00:21:02,090
Aren't you hungry?

381
00:21:02,090 --> 00:21:02,850
Let's go eat.

382
00:21:02,850 --> 00:21:03,290
Correct.

383
00:21:03,290 --> 00:21:04,170
Let's go.

384
00:21:04,170 --> 00:21:04,970
See you, Chairman of the Board of Directors.

385
00:21:04,970 --> 00:21:05,850
See you, Miss Ke.

386
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:06,890
See you, Manager Liu.

387
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:23,290
Come on, let's sit down.

388
00:21:23,610 --> 00:21:24,410
Please sit.

389
00:21:27,650 --> 00:21:28,730
What next?

390
00:21:30,050 --> 00:21:31,490
Lend me your cell phone.

391
00:21:37,850 --> 00:21:38,770
Just use this one.

392
00:21:51,570 --> 00:21:52,370
Sorry.

393
00:21:55,010 --> 00:21:55,890
Halo.

394
00:21:56,210 --> 00:21:57,610
Halo, David.

395
00:21:57,890 --> 00:21:59,050
I'm Julia.

396
00:21:59,050 --> 00:22:00,290
You... Julia?

397
00:22:01,290 --> 00:22:02,090
Irritating.

398
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:03,970
Have you forgotten me?

399
00:22:04,490 --> 00:22:06,370
At that time I was still accompanying you to drink.

400
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:08,170
Sorry.

401
00:22:08,170 --> 00:22:10,970
Just now your voice was a little unclear.

402
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,010
Well then, are you free tonight?

403
00:22:14,810 --> 00:22:16,090
I'll go look for you.

404
00:22:16,370 --> 00:22:18,330
Are you still living where you were at that time...

405
00:22:19,530 --> 00:22:20,890
Hotel Four Seasons.

406
00:22:22,810 --> 00:22:23,810
Good.

407
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:26,450
Then, at 20.00,

408
00:22:26,450 --> 00:22:28,570
Let's meet at the Four Seasons Hotel bar, okay?

409
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:29,690
See you later.

410
00:22:39,970 --> 00:22:40,970
Don't look at me.

411
00:22:56,410 --> 00:22:58,570
Do you think those dilapidated jars...

412
00:22:59,570 --> 00:23:00,930
how much can it be sold for?

413
00:23:00,930 --> 00:23:02,450
That item is very valuable.

414
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,050
A dilapidated object like that has no value.

415
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,330
Don't you see that everything inside is empty?

416
00:23:09,090 --> 00:23:10,170
Empty?

417
00:23:14,570 --> 00:23:15,690
Correct.

418
00:23:16,210 --> 00:23:17,290
Empty.

419
00:23:19,690 --> 00:23:21,170
Look at your stupid self.

420
00:23:21,770 --> 00:23:22,930
You think

421
00:23:22,930 --> 00:23:25,130
we just smuggle it?

422
00:23:26,930 --> 00:23:28,010
If so, according to you,

423
00:23:28,010 --> 00:23:29,450
what goes into it?

424
00:23:32,130 --> 00:23:33,450
Valuable goods.

425
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,290
Correct.

426
00:23:37,010 --> 00:23:38,490
If you want to send rice,

427
00:23:38,970 --> 00:23:40,530
also no need to ask us.

428
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:41,490
Right, right?

429
00:23:42,810 --> 00:23:44,250
You finally understand, Newbie.

430
00:23:45,370 --> 00:23:46,290
today,

431
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,730
let me tell you

432
00:23:47,730 --> 00:23:50,690
the most important points in doing work in this area.

433
00:23:51,650 --> 00:23:53,010
The most important point

434
00:23:53,370 --> 00:23:55,130
is to have to work without knowing anything,

435
00:23:55,250 --> 00:23:56,930
what we get is money of unknown origin.

436
00:23:58,650 --> 00:23:59,930
Smuggling

437
00:23:59,930 --> 00:24:03,130
different from your usual way of collecting debts.

438
00:24:03,570 --> 00:24:05,850
You have to face many people and many things, right?

439
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,690
The more you know and understand,

440
00:24:07,970 --> 00:24:09,370
then your risk is smaller.

441
00:24:09,770 --> 00:24:11,130
We are the opposite.

442
00:24:11,890 --> 00:24:14,570
We had to work without knowing anything

443
00:24:14,570 --> 00:24:15,810
to avoid risks.

444
00:24:16,410 --> 00:24:17,210
Just think about it.

445
00:24:17,570 --> 00:24:18,650
If you knew that

446
00:24:18,650 --> 00:24:20,930
the items you smuggled are very valuable,

447
00:24:21,250 --> 00:24:23,330
wouldn't you be greedy,

448
00:24:23,610 --> 00:24:25,010
Thinking about reaping the biggest profits yourself?

449
00:24:25,410 --> 00:24:26,290
Correct.

450
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:27,730
However, if you know

451
00:24:27,730 --> 00:24:29,250
that the contraband is dangerous,

452
00:24:30,330 --> 00:24:31,650
for example a gun,

453
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,570
wouldn't you be afraid?

454
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:34,890
Don't dare anymore?

455
00:24:34,890 --> 00:24:35,530
Correct.

456
00:24:35,530 --> 00:24:37,610
If you don't dare, how can you make money?

457
00:24:39,130 --> 00:24:39,650
Makes sense.

458
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,450
About knowing or not knowing,

459
00:24:42,050 --> 00:24:43,770
if caught by the police,

460
00:24:43,770 --> 00:24:45,370
the charges are much different.

461
00:24:46,490 --> 00:24:48,450
So, the best way is

462
00:24:48,930 --> 00:24:52,570
become a stupid driver who works for money.

463
00:24:53,610 --> 00:24:55,250
Don't play with this useless stuff.

464
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,610
I'm bored.

465
00:24:56,610 --> 00:24:58,370
Working without knowing anything is safest.

466
00:24:58,530 --> 00:24:59,610
Do you understand?

467
00:25:00,850 --> 00:25:01,890
I understand.

468
00:25:02,130 --> 00:25:04,170
It turns out that pretending to be stupid is also a science.

469
00:25:06,250 --> 00:25:07,090
If you understand,

470
00:25:07,410 --> 00:25:08,610
absorb it well.

471
00:25:08,610 --> 00:25:09,450
I went to pee.

472
00:25:09,450 --> 00:25:10,130
Good.

473
00:25:19,410 --> 00:25:20,330
Money.

474
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:29,650
Kapten Xiao.

475
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:32,090
Who's this?

476
00:25:32,450 --> 00:25:34,010
More and more handsome, yes.

477
00:25:35,130 --> 00:25:35,810
Don't, don't.

478
00:25:35,810 --> 00:25:37,290
Old men don't always joke like this.

479
00:25:37,890 --> 00:25:38,770
Look at you.

480
00:25:38,850 --> 00:25:39,730
Let me introduce you.

481
00:25:39,730 --> 00:25:41,090
This is my partner, Wang Lina.

482
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:41,930
Hello, Captain Xiao.

483
00:25:42,090 --> 00:25:42,770
Halo.

484
00:25:43,330 --> 00:25:44,050
Ayo.

485
00:25:44,050 --> 00:25:45,250
We chat in the meeting room.

486
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:50,210
Have the documents been photocopied?

487
00:25:51,050 --> 00:25:52,250
According to logic,

488
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:53,410
working in the Narcotics Unit,

489
00:25:53,410 --> 00:25:55,330
the more normal your appearance looks,

490
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,410
the more unrecognizable they are when they blend in, the better.

491
00:25:58,930 --> 00:26:00,330
Where is there anyone like you,

492
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,290
more and more handsome,

493
00:26:02,690 --> 00:26:04,410
more and more, less and less like a good person.

494
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,090
Let me interview you for a moment.

495
00:26:06,610 --> 00:26:08,570
Every day you frown like this,

496
00:26:09,130 --> 00:26:11,290
Isn't your sister-in-law annoyed to see you?

497
00:26:12,410 --> 00:26:13,810
Does this have anything to do with you?

498
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,170
My wife really likes me like this.

499
00:26:16,810 --> 00:26:17,770
Okay.

500
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,450
I applaud your confidence.

501
00:26:23,490 --> 00:26:25,250
How will the affairs I hand over to you proceed?

502
00:26:30,330 --> 00:26:31,570
Li Mingshan ini

503
00:26:31,570 --> 00:26:33,170
a tropical fish seller.

504
00:26:33,290 --> 00:26:35,570
Almost none of our young colleagues knew him.

505
00:26:35,810 --> 00:26:36,650
However,

506
00:26:37,450 --> 00:26:39,010
Mr. Lu suspects that she is Lu Er.

507
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:48,050
Lu Er?

508
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,370
That Lu Er shot me?

509
00:26:57,650 --> 00:26:59,330
Because of that shot,

510
00:27:00,650 --> 00:27:03,050
Chen took advantage of me for ten years.

511
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:05,090
Treat clients to drinks,

512
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:06,450
be the scapegoat,

513
00:27:06,610 --> 00:27:08,450
I did all that.

514
00:27:12,570 --> 00:27:13,970
I'm not afraid of anything,

515
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,290
just afraid of him.

516
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:18,050
Usually he always babbles,

517
00:27:19,050 --> 00:27:20,410
but if you think back,

518
00:27:20,410 --> 00:27:22,090
if it weren't for him repeatedly warning,

519
00:27:22,410 --> 00:27:23,690
I also wouldn't have lived until now.

520
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:25,130
Correct.

521
00:27:29,250 --> 00:27:30,210
When there's time,

522
00:27:31,090 --> 00:27:33,250
let's go together and drink at his grave.

523
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:42,090
You can also look at this photo.

524
00:27:53,290 --> 00:27:55,170
This bastard fought quite hard, huh.

525
00:27:55,970 --> 00:27:57,610
So fat like this.

526
00:28:02,890 --> 00:28:03,890
Look at him.

527
00:28:04,090 --> 00:28:04,930
On his neck

528
00:28:04,930 --> 00:28:06,250
and behind his collar.

529
00:28:06,490 --> 00:28:08,250
We've compared these birthmarks.

530
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:09,930
Almost exactly the same as

531
00:28:09,930 --> 00:28:11,090
Lu Er's birthmark in the file.

532
00:28:17,250 --> 00:28:18,610
It's been almost ten years.

533
00:28:19,490 --> 00:28:21,330
So far there has been no information about Lu Er.

534
00:28:22,410 --> 00:28:25,130
To think this bastard was hiding right under my eyes.

535
00:28:26,530 --> 00:28:27,450
Okay.

536
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,490
What's around you is invisible.

537
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:31,490
This bastard appeared,

538
00:28:31,610 --> 00:28:32,850
there must be something big.

539
00:28:33,650 --> 00:28:34,690
How?

540
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:36,050
Give orders,

541
00:28:36,690 --> 00:28:37,650
let's work together.

542
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:51,250
Wu.

543
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:54,650
Can you find a place and sit down?

544
00:28:55,130 --> 00:28:56,650
Put down what you're holding.

545
00:28:56,650 --> 00:28:58,570
It's so noisy, it's just annoying.

546
00:29:09,570 --> 00:29:10,290
Kak Qiang.

547
00:29:11,490 --> 00:29:14,490
What do you think is actually contained in this jar?

548
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:15,730
If it

549
00:29:15,730 --> 00:29:16,810
drugs or similar,

550
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,730
can we still have a way to live?

551
00:29:22,610 --> 00:29:24,530
Since you came with me,

552
00:29:25,050 --> 00:29:27,810
You should have anticipated your ending would be like now.

553
00:29:27,810 --> 00:29:29,370
What's the bad ending?

554
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:30,530
Sis, you just talk nonsense.

555
00:29:30,930 --> 00:29:32,770
I want to end up like you,

556
00:29:33,050 --> 00:29:34,210
looking for a good wife,

557
00:29:34,210 --> 00:29:35,250
have children

558
00:29:37,810 --> 00:29:39,570
Get married and have children,

559
00:29:39,570 --> 00:29:41,410
it's that easy.

560
00:29:42,330 --> 00:29:43,530
Am I not the same as you now?

561
00:29:43,530 --> 00:29:44,690
Also locked up here.

562
00:29:44,690 --> 00:29:46,370
Don't say locked up.

563
00:29:46,650 --> 00:29:47,490
If you say locked up,

564
00:29:47,490 --> 00:29:48,930
it feels like we are in prison.

565
00:29:51,090 --> 00:29:52,210
Little brat.

566
00:29:53,050 --> 00:29:54,210
All aspects of you are good,

567
00:29:54,370 --> 00:29:55,690
it's just that your guts are a bit small.

568
00:29:57,610 --> 00:29:59,650
Don't keep scaring yourself.

569
00:30:01,210 --> 00:30:02,930
You have to think more positively,

570
00:30:02,930 --> 00:30:04,770
then good things will come naturally.

571
00:30:05,890 --> 00:30:07,330
If you always think about bad things,

572
00:30:07,330 --> 00:30:09,010
then good things will never come.

573
00:30:09,010 --> 00:30:10,570
Now you should think,

574
00:30:11,290 --> 00:30:13,970
we complete this transaction safely and securely.

575
00:30:14,490 --> 00:30:15,330
Then, money...

576
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,330
money comes.

577
00:30:17,650 --> 00:30:19,810
What if it's not safe?

578
00:30:24,730 --> 00:30:27,210
Didn't I keep telling you to think positively?

579
00:30:27,210 --> 00:30:27,810
You're...

580
00:30:27,810 --> 00:30:28,570
I can't control my thoughts.

581
00:30:28,570 --> 00:30:29,370
Now I

582
00:30:29,370 --> 00:30:30,850
full of negative energy.

583
00:30:35,330 --> 00:30:36,370
Wu.

584
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:37,810
Listen to Sis Qiang,

585
00:30:38,570 --> 00:30:39,370
it'll be okay.

586
00:30:39,850 --> 00:30:41,770
Sis Qiang doesn't want to die either.

587
00:30:42,170 --> 00:30:43,370
I also want to live.

588
00:30:43,370 --> 00:30:44,170
In the future,

589
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:48,250
I still want to have fun with my child every day.

590
00:30:48,530 --> 00:30:49,570
True, or not?

591
00:30:52,330 --> 00:30:53,290
My son, Qiang...

592
00:30:58,610 --> 00:31:00,010
I've said from the start,

593
00:31:00,730 --> 00:31:01,450
I...

594
00:31:02,050 --> 00:31:03,250
I shouldn't have come here!

595
00:31:06,010 --> 00:31:06,810
What?

596
00:31:09,730 --> 00:31:10,610
Kak Qiang,

597
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:12,530
I will tell you the truth.

598
00:31:12,810 --> 00:31:14,970
This time I came not at all of my own will.

599
00:31:15,690 --> 00:31:16,570
Nope.

600
00:31:16,690 --> 00:31:18,050
What do you mean?

601
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:26,490
Lord Feng told me to come to be a spy.

602
00:31:31,690 --> 00:31:33,330
You're looking for death!

603
00:31:35,370 --> 00:31:37,810
Wasn't it you who told me to take her heart before?

604
00:31:38,010 --> 00:31:38,690
no,

605
00:31:38,690 --> 00:31:40,330
moreover now he is very good to me,

606
00:31:40,330 --> 00:31:41,650
gave me a Mercedes and also...

607
00:31:42,090 --> 00:31:43,370
I told you to take...

608
00:31:43,450 --> 00:31:44,210
I...

609
00:31:49,290 --> 00:31:50,650
Then, what did he tell you to do?

610
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:54,690
He told me to find out what was being smuggled this time,

611
00:31:55,650 --> 00:31:57,930
also smuggled from where and to where.

612
00:31:57,930 --> 00:32:00,370
Once you know, go back and report to him.

613
00:32:08,530 --> 00:32:09,650
I told you, right?

614
00:32:09,930 --> 00:32:11,130
I shouldn't have come.

615
00:32:42,330 --> 00:32:43,570
In this operation to arrest Lu Er,

616
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:46,050
there is a risk that your informant's identity will be revealed,

617
00:32:46,450 --> 00:32:47,690
it's time to get him out.

618
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:50,570
That's it.

619
00:32:51,690 --> 00:32:53,050
That should be enough, right?

620
00:32:53,370 --> 00:32:54,170
Setting Lu E,

621
00:32:54,170 --> 00:32:56,810
blocked the Feng family's exit,

622
00:32:56,810 --> 00:32:58,370
everything went very smoothly.

623
00:32:58,690 --> 00:32:59,890
It's time to pull the net.

624
00:33:01,250 --> 00:33:02,210
Bureau Chief Liu.

625
00:33:02,810 --> 00:33:04,570
I keep feeling like something is wrong.

626
00:33:07,450 --> 00:33:08,810
What's wrong?

627
00:33:10,690 --> 00:33:11,650
Too smooth.

628
00:33:12,810 --> 00:33:14,050
Too smooth?

629
00:33:14,570 --> 00:33:15,290
Correct,

630
00:33:15,450 --> 00:33:16,450
too smooth.

631
00:33:17,450 --> 00:33:18,450
Try to think about it,

632
00:33:18,570 --> 00:33:20,450
even that bastard Lu Er came out of hiding,

633
00:33:20,810 --> 00:33:23,250
this money that the Feng family wants to move must be very important,

634
00:33:23,250 --> 00:33:24,290
can't tolerate mistakes.

635
00:33:24,890 --> 00:33:26,650
However, now they do it like this,

636
00:33:26,930 --> 00:33:28,410
Don't you think it's too risky?

637
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:31,010
This is not the Feng brothers' style of acting.

638
00:33:31,690 --> 00:33:32,930
They depend on luck,

639
00:33:32,930 --> 00:33:34,330
so cornered he would do anything.

640
00:33:35,770 --> 00:33:36,810
In essence, Bureau Chief Liu,

641
00:33:37,050 --> 00:33:39,130
I think we should stick with the old ways.

642
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:41,290
Before knowing the opponent's main goal,

643
00:33:41,770 --> 00:33:43,450
You must prepare a backup plan carefully.

644
00:33:43,610 --> 00:33:45,890
This problem must be seen from a broader realm.

645
00:33:47,650 --> 00:33:48,850
Stay cool.

646
00:33:49,170 --> 00:33:50,570
You just focus on chasing your fugitive,

647
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:53,130
I'll coordinate the rest.

648
00:33:56,970 --> 00:33:57,970
However,

649
00:33:58,970 --> 00:34:00,250
still have to be careful.

650
00:34:00,250 --> 00:34:01,210
Good.

651
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:13,930
Have you checked your communications equipment?

652
00:34:13,930 --> 00:34:14,640
Already.

653
00:34:15,050 --> 00:34:15,970
At night you have to be more alert.

654
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:16,450
Good.

655
00:34:19,130 --> 00:34:19,640
Have arrived.

656
00:34:20,160 --> 00:34:20,850
Captain Xiao has arrived.

657
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:26,290
Kapten Xiao.

658
00:34:35,890 --> 00:34:39,240
No matter what means, carefully protect this person's safety.

659
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:41,160
- Good. - Good.

660
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:41,610
Good.

661
00:34:42,050 --> 00:34:42,570
Let's go.

662
00:34:42,720 --> 00:34:43,410
Move.

663
00:35:16,330 --> 00:35:17,250
Can it work?

664
00:35:42,210 --> 00:35:42,930
Cheers.

665
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:13,050
Hello, I want to order alcohol.

666
00:36:15,610 --> 00:36:16,890
Whatever he orders,

667
00:36:16,890 --> 00:36:18,010
I'm the one paying.

668
00:36:18,330 --> 00:36:18,850
Thank you very much,

669
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:19,770
but it's not necessary.

670
00:36:19,770 --> 00:36:20,570
Mari.

671
00:36:20,650 --> 00:36:21,490
Do not hesitate.

672
00:36:21,490 --> 00:36:22,370
What do you want to drink?

673
00:36:22,850 --> 00:36:23,490
Okay.

674
00:36:24,290 --> 00:36:25,770
Mojito.

675
00:36:25,770 --> 00:36:26,730
Two glasses of mojito.

676
00:36:28,570 --> 00:36:29,330
Do you know,

677
00:36:30,170 --> 00:36:31,730
my favorite thing is

678
00:36:32,250 --> 00:36:35,130
ordered a glass of mojito at the airport at 06.00.

679
00:36:36,090 --> 00:36:37,090
Really interesting.

680
00:36:39,050 --> 00:36:40,730
Do you want to

681
00:36:41,690 --> 00:36:43,330
try it in my room?

682
00:36:44,890 --> 00:36:45,890
What do you think?

683
00:36:48,530 --> 00:36:49,410
No problem.

684
00:36:50,770 --> 00:36:52,050
I want to pay.

685
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:02,090
Come on, hurry up.

686
00:37:06,210 --> 00:37:06,970
Are you ready?

687
00:37:07,410 --> 00:37:08,050
Of course.

688
00:37:08,410 --> 00:37:08,850
Good.

689
00:37:08,850 --> 00:37:09,450
Let's go.

690
00:37:21,700 --> 00:37:24,000
(In ten minutes call me)

691
00:37:33,890 --> 00:37:34,410
Good.

692
00:37:36,130 --> 00:37:36,970
Please come in.

693
00:37:41,090 --> 00:37:42,090
Please sit.

694
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,050
Beautiful lady.

695
00:38:10,930 --> 00:38:13,770
This is the best quality whiskey.

696
00:38:14,890 --> 00:38:16,010
Try it.

697
00:38:26,610 --> 00:38:27,610
Cheers.

698
00:38:33,090 --> 00:38:34,010
Drink more.

699
00:38:34,010 --> 00:38:34,810
Drink more.

700
00:38:35,610 --> 00:38:36,370
Correct.

701
00:38:36,770 --> 00:38:37,850
Fine.

702
00:38:47,690 --> 00:38:48,610
Your hair...

703
00:38:49,850 --> 00:38:51,370
why is it so long?

704
00:38:52,170 --> 00:38:54,970
It's really beautiful.

705
00:38:58,970 --> 00:39:00,530
This whiskey of yours is really delicious.

706
00:39:01,650 --> 00:39:02,730
Let's drink a little more.

707
00:39:02,730 --> 00:39:03,530
In that case...

708
00:39:03,530 --> 00:39:04,730
drink more.

709
00:39:09,450 --> 00:39:10,290
Mari.

710
00:40:00,130 --> 00:40:01,410
OK, OK.

711
00:40:03,530 --> 00:40:04,690
Wait, wait.

712
00:40:06,930 --> 00:40:07,530
Halo.

713
00:40:08,970 --> 00:40:09,290
What?

714
00:40:09,290 --> 00:40:10,170
Report?

715
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:10,770
I'm outside,

716
00:40:10,770 --> 00:40:11,850
I can't send it to you.

717
00:40:12,970 --> 00:40:14,090
Do you have a laptop?

718
00:40:16,530 --> 00:40:17,170
Lend it to me.

719
00:40:17,850 --> 00:40:18,450
Good.

720
00:40:18,970 --> 00:40:20,050
OK, I'll send it right away.

721
00:40:23,130 --> 00:40:24,050
I'll send it immediately.

722
00:40:24,370 --> 00:40:25,130
Laptop.

723
00:40:29,250 --> 00:40:30,090
Laptop.

724
00:40:32,210 --> 00:40:33,090
Laptop.

725
00:40:36,970 --> 00:40:37,730
Password.

726
00:40:38,290 --> 00:40:39,010
Password?

727
00:40:40,930 --> 00:40:41,610
Good.

728
00:40:54,370 --> 00:40:55,530
Go take a shower.

729
00:40:55,650 --> 00:40:56,610
Mandi?

730
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,090
I understand.

731
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,730
Then you... wait for me.
