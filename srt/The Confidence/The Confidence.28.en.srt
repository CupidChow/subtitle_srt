=Episode 28=

3
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:36,050
In addition, the Feng Group recently

4
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,290
also invested large amounts

5
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:39,810
in several domestic unicorn companies.

6
00:01:40,130 --> 00:01:41,170
So are some of these companies

7
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:42,890
succeeded in becoming a public company in America,

8
00:01:44,410 --> 00:01:46,090
hence the domestic assets of the Feng Group

9
00:01:46,090 --> 00:01:47,250
can be rushed outside

10
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:48,250
openly.

11
00:01:51,530 --> 00:01:52,290
Kapten Xiao,

12
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,810
once they hit the bell,

13
00:01:56,010 --> 00:01:57,770
then our previous work will be in vain.

14
00:01:59,050 --> 00:02:00,410
So, we have to find out soon

15
00:02:00,770 --> 00:02:02,130
evidence of their crimes.

16
00:02:02,570 --> 00:02:03,410
Hurry up,

17
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:04,490
speed up your steps.

18
00:02:05,130 --> 00:02:06,890
Unicorn company?

19
00:02:18,410 --> 00:02:19,930
Do you know

20
00:02:20,210 --> 00:02:21,130
what is a unicorn company?

21
00:02:24,890 --> 00:02:26,330
Sebelumnya, Feng Xiaosheng

22
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:28,050
seems to have

23
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:29,490
told me the same topic.

24
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,410
I don't really care.

25
00:02:35,810 --> 00:02:36,250
Unikorn

26
00:02:36,250 --> 00:02:37,730
is a kind of living creature in myth,

27
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:39,690
rare and valuable.

28
00:02:40,850 --> 00:02:41,970
Meanwhile, unicorn companies

29
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:44,090
is the concept introduced

30
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:45,610
by a venture capitalist,

31
00:02:45,610 --> 00:02:47,090
Aileen Lee, in 2013.

32
00:02:47,690 --> 00:02:48,690
The short is

33
00:02:49,490 --> 00:02:50,850
companies whose valuation exceeds

34
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,210
one billion American dollars, ever got

35
00:02:53,210 --> 00:02:54,890
private equity and has not yet entered the stock exchange

36
00:02:55,170 --> 00:02:56,610
within ten years of its founding.

37
00:02:57,570 --> 00:02:58,290
Is this related?

38
00:02:58,290 --> 00:02:59,250
with the Feng Group?

39
00:03:03,050 --> 00:03:04,090
These few years,

40
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:07,050
The Feng Group successively stopped

41
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:07,970
ongoing project

42
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:09,210
and newly built domestically.

43
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:10,730
A large amount of funds poured in

44
00:03:10,730 --> 00:03:11,930
abroad through

45
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:12,730
foreign investment.

46
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,530
The Supervision Department must have noticed

47
00:03:15,530 --> 00:03:16,410
this strange movement.

48
00:03:16,770 --> 00:03:17,850
Therefore, at the beginning of this year,

49
00:03:18,410 --> 00:03:20,290
they block the outflow route of funds.

50
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:22,810
Furthermore, after the third quarter report,

51
00:03:23,730 --> 00:03:24,610
Feng Group invested in

52
00:03:24,610 --> 00:03:26,090
dozens of unicorn companies.

53
00:03:26,090 --> 00:03:27,650
The speed and scale

54
00:03:27,650 --> 00:03:28,650
very abnormal.

55
00:03:29,410 --> 00:03:30,330
Besides, all this

56
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:31,650
have to wait until next April,

57
00:03:32,170 --> 00:03:33,330
it will only be known to the market.

58
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:36,170
Pause that time

59
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:37,530
played beautifully.

60
00:03:44,810 --> 00:03:47,290
In that case, the Feng Group invests in so many unicorn companies,

61
00:03:49,050 --> 00:03:50,450
how does the money come out?

62
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:52,650
First,

63
00:03:53,930 --> 00:03:55,570
domestically, they use the yuan to

64
00:03:55,570 --> 00:03:57,090
invest in unicorn companies.

65
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,410
After this company

66
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,570
become a public company abroad,

67
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:00,730
money will be paid in American dollars.

68
00:04:01,330 --> 00:04:02,170
Second,

69
00:04:02,490 --> 00:04:03,650
after the quarterly report is announced,

70
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,570
there will be half a year of report vacuum time.

71
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,410
In this period,

72
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,290
financial activities are unknown to people.

73
00:04:10,210 --> 00:04:10,650
Until now

74
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:11,890
everyone realizes it,

75
00:04:12,050 --> 00:04:12,650
Feng Group already

76
00:04:12,650 --> 00:04:13,930
escape first.

77
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:21,040
Unicorn or what is it,

78
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:23,930
Is it really that easy to become a public company in America?

79
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:27,130
The existence of investment banks is not in vain.

80
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:28,250
Of course,

81
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:30,410
facilitation payments must still be given.

82
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,370
Enter.

83
00:04:39,650 --> 00:04:40,290
Sis,

84
00:04:40,930 --> 00:04:42,010
can you go home from work?

85
00:04:44,610 --> 00:04:46,090
You looked for me just to ask

86
00:04:46,090 --> 00:04:47,170
can you come home from work?

87
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:49,890
This is my first day at work,

88
00:04:50,210 --> 00:04:51,250
I myself

89
00:04:51,570 --> 00:04:53,050
I'm a bit skeptical.

90
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:54,570
I see,

91
00:04:54,850 --> 00:04:55,410
after work time

92
00:04:55,410 --> 00:04:56,690
it's been so long.

93
00:04:56,970 --> 00:04:57,610
our business units

94
00:04:57,610 --> 00:04:58,490
everyone is overtime.

95
00:04:59,130 --> 00:05:00,690
If I leave straight away, that's not good either.

96
00:05:00,810 --> 00:05:01,730
However, if it stays there,

97
00:05:02,050 --> 00:05:03,250
I don't know what to do either.

98
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:08,730
If so, go home.

99
00:05:09,290 --> 00:05:10,090
Good.

100
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:16,450
Mine.

101
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:31,690
Halo.

102
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:32,890
Mr. Feng,

103
00:05:32,890 --> 00:05:34,010
are you free to talk?

104
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:38,770
Of.

105
00:05:38,810 --> 00:05:39,490
Say it.

106
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:43,010
The task that second uncle ordered,

107
00:05:43,090 --> 00:05:44,450
he said there was someone in the factory helping.

108
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:45,490
Inside the material warehouse,

109
00:05:45,490 --> 00:05:46,690
there are ready-to-use items.

110
00:05:47,290 --> 00:05:47,890
If I go there,

111
00:05:47,890 --> 00:05:49,290
at least just start a fire.

112
00:05:51,970 --> 00:05:52,690
I really don't know

113
00:05:52,690 --> 00:05:53,890
why does he want to do that?

114
00:05:54,210 --> 00:05:54,690
So, I think,

115
00:05:54,690 --> 00:05:56,250
I have to tell you first

116
00:05:56,330 --> 00:05:57,890
and hear your opinion.

117
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:00,450
Mr. Feng.

118
00:06:04,290 --> 00:06:05,450
Just do as he says.

119
00:06:34,170 --> 00:06:34,970
Let's go.

120
00:06:55,410 --> 00:06:56,130
Sis,

121
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:57,850
Today I invited Sis Qiang

122
00:06:57,850 --> 00:06:58,690
and friends

123
00:06:58,810 --> 00:06:59,890
gathered at Jujinxiao.

124
00:07:00,610 --> 00:07:01,930
You and Kak Ke also come along.

125
00:07:02,890 --> 00:07:04,410
Today is a big day in my life

126
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:05,370
and very meaningful.

127
00:07:05,530 --> 00:07:06,930
I'm treating you all to some fun.

128
00:07:09,370 --> 00:07:10,250
Are you interested?

129
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:12,130
Do you want to go play together for a while?

130
00:07:12,130 --> 00:07:12,850
Come on.

131
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:15,330
Mr. Meng did the treating,

132
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:16,690
however,

133
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:17,890
Of course you have to liven it up, right?

134
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:20,410
Please don't call me Mr. Meng.

135
00:07:21,170 --> 00:07:22,650
Deliberately embarrassing me, huh?

136
00:07:22,970 --> 00:07:24,250
Just call Wu,

137
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:25,210
more familiar.

138
00:07:25,410 --> 00:07:26,210
That's right, right, Brother-in-law?

139
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,010
Ayo.

140
00:07:58,570 --> 00:07:59,290
Fast.

141
00:08:02,090 --> 00:08:02,650
Ayo.

142
00:08:09,890 --> 00:08:10,730
This time,

143
00:08:10,730 --> 00:08:11,890
how is the quality of the alcohol?

144
00:08:12,330 --> 00:08:13,170
No problem.

145
00:08:13,450 --> 00:08:14,930
Our place never sells fake alcohol.

146
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:16,290
How do guests respond?

147
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,770
Very good.

148
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:19,410
Nobody reported it

149
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:19,970
there is a problem.

150
00:08:19,970 --> 00:08:21,250
- May Nan. - Think.

151
00:08:22,810 --> 00:08:23,490
What is it?

152
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:26,050
The large room above was emptied.

153
00:08:26,970 --> 00:08:28,410
Will Mr. Feng come?

154
00:08:28,970 --> 00:08:29,690
Of.

155
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:32,040
You're a fan of Mr. Feng, right?

156
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:33,890
Of course.

157
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:35,450
Mr. Feng is rich,

158
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:36,490
also handsome.

159
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:38,330
Powerful, cool, boss style.

160
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:40,010
So perfect, right?

161
00:08:40,410 --> 00:08:41,770
You little girls indeed

162
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:42,680
shallow.

163
00:08:44,330 --> 00:08:46,050
Mr. Feng will not like your type.

164
00:08:46,410 --> 00:08:47,130
Go to work.

165
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:48,970
Zhu Di.

166
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:49,890
I'm telling you, yeah.

167
00:08:50,650 --> 00:08:52,570
If you want to approach Mr. Feng,

168
00:08:53,290 --> 00:08:54,490
that is also not impossible.

169
00:08:55,410 --> 00:08:56,250
I'm telling you, yeah.

170
00:08:56,610 --> 00:08:58,130
His current girlfriend,

171
00:08:58,290 --> 00:09:00,050
used to work here.

172
00:09:01,130 --> 00:09:02,250
Seriously?

173
00:09:02,490 --> 00:09:03,450
In the newspaper it was written,

174
00:09:03,450 --> 00:09:04,890
her boyfriend is a lecturer.

175
00:09:05,130 --> 00:09:06,330
Look, you don't even believe it.

176
00:09:06,890 --> 00:09:07,930
I saw with my own eyes,

177
00:09:07,930 --> 00:09:09,170
he was beaten by Kak Dao Jian,

178
00:09:09,170 --> 00:09:09,970
and Sis Wu

179
00:09:09,970 --> 00:09:11,170
who took him to the hospital.

180
00:09:11,370 --> 00:09:12,370
What are you saying?

181
00:09:13,410 --> 00:09:14,530
Don't look for trouble, yes.

182
00:09:17,770 --> 00:09:19,010
Manager, Mr. Feng has arrived.

183
00:09:19,490 --> 00:09:20,370
Okay.

184
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:21,610
I'll remind you, okay?

185
00:09:21,810 --> 00:09:22,770
Mr. Feng has come,

186
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,850
don't just talk anything.

187
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:24,770
Don't look for trouble for me.

188
00:09:35,050 --> 00:09:35,930
Thank you.

189
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:36,810
It doesn't matter.

190
00:12:40,090 --> 00:12:41,370
(Fire occurs)

191
00:12:41,370 --> 00:12:42,170
(around 11 o'clock)

192
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:43,330
(last night.)

193
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:44,570
(The cause of the fire is unclear.)

194
00:12:44,570 --> 00:12:46,090

(and cause)

196
00:12:47,170 --> 00:12:48,530
(unknown object explodes.)

197
00:12:48,610 --> 00:12:50,050
(At 23.28,)

198
00:12:50,050 --> 00:12:50,810
(fire brigade arrives)

199
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:52,490
(after receiving reports from residents.)

200
00:12:52,490 --> 00:12:54,850
(However, due to illegal construction around the factory area,)

201
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:56,610
(water supply pipe is damaged,)

202
00:12:56,610 --> 00:12:57,850
(causes a hydrant outside the factory)

203
00:12:57,850 --> 00:12:58,930
(unable to remove water.)

204
00:12:58,930 --> 00:12:59,610
(Fire team too)

205
00:12:59,610 --> 00:13:01,130
(had to find another source of water.)

206
00:13:01,130 --> 00:13:02,850
(Factory area 1500 square meters,)

207
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:04,770
(burnt area is about 600 square meters.)

208
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:06,050
(Fire team reports that)

209
00:13:06,050 --> 00:13:07,970
(The fire came from factory building number three.)

210
00:13:08,250 --> 00:13:09,170
(The cause of the fire is unclear,)

211
00:13:09,170 --> 00:13:10,290
(still under investigation.)

212
00:13:10,770 --> 00:13:12,890
(No fire victims were found.)

213
00:13:13,290 --> 00:13:14,450
(Now factory buildings nearby)

214
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,930
(checking)

215
00:13:15,930 --> 00:13:17,010
(property loss.)

216
00:13:17,730 --> 00:13:19,050
(According to information from local residents,)

217
00:13:19,050 --> 00:13:20,650
(around 11 o'clock last night,)

218
00:13:20,650 --> 00:13:21,890
(suddenly there is an explosion.)

219
00:13:22,210 --> 00:13:23,610
(According to internal analysis,)

220
00:13:23,610 --> 00:13:25,010
(fire should cause)

221
00:13:25,010 --> 00:13:25,970
(a large number of batteries)

222
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:27,490
(new stored energy car)

223
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:28,650
(inside the car factory explodes.)

224
00:13:28,810 --> 00:13:30,330
(Aoxin's new energy car factory)

225
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:30,850
(owned by)

226
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:33,090
(Feng-Fuyong Holding Company,)

227
00:13:33,090 --> 00:13:34,770
(which is also the core company)

228
00:13:34,770 --> 00:13:35,890
(from Feng Group.)

229
00:13:36,250 --> 00:13:36,930
(Not long ago,)

230
00:13:36,930 --> 00:13:38,250
(Aoxin's car just held)

231
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:39,490
(massive presale.)

232
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,290
Did you know beforehand?

233
00:13:53,610 --> 00:13:54,810
Big Boss Feng did it?

234
00:13:56,370 --> 00:13:57,290
If not?

235
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:03,610
Unexpected method

236
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,410
kill a thousand opponents

237
00:14:04,410 --> 00:14:05,810
and sacrificed 800 of his own soldiers,

238
00:14:07,370 --> 00:14:08,890
don't give a way out for yourself.

239
00:14:11,690 --> 00:14:12,850
It seems that must be resisted

240
00:14:13,650 --> 00:14:14,690
not just us.

241
00:14:34,450 --> 00:14:35,290
Gang.

242
00:14:40,570 --> 00:14:41,370
Chairman of the Board of Directors.

243
00:14:41,530 --> 00:14:42,090
Journalists have

244
00:14:42,090 --> 00:14:43,410
crowded the entrance.

245
00:14:43,410 --> 00:14:44,530
If you leave at this time,

246
00:14:44,530 --> 00:14:45,410
You will definitely be intercepted

247
00:14:45,410 --> 00:14:46,090
and asked this and that.

248
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:46,890
How, how.

249
00:14:46,890 --> 00:14:47,890
Have you seen the news?

250
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:50,690
Suddenly there was a fire that big,

251
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:52,170
how big is the loss?

252
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:53,490
Gang,

253
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:54,610
You go out first in my car.

254
00:14:54,610 --> 00:14:55,410
An follow him.

255
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:56,570
Divert journalists at the entrance,

256
00:14:56,570 --> 00:14:57,770
take them for a spin.

257
00:14:58,610 --> 00:14:59,650
I'm going out in your car.

258
00:14:59,650 --> 00:15:00,370
Fine.

259
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:01,330
I think so too.

260
00:15:01,730 --> 00:15:02,210
Fast.

261
00:15:21,250 --> 00:15:22,010
Halo.

262
00:15:23,930 --> 00:15:24,970
Deputy Governor Tang.

263
00:15:25,210 --> 00:15:26,610
Hello, it's me.

264
00:15:27,450 --> 00:15:28,130
Good.

265
00:15:28,610 --> 00:15:29,530
Fine.

266
00:15:30,050 --> 00:15:31,650
I will immediately reprimand the Feng Group.

267
00:15:32,490 --> 00:15:33,570
Leaders, please don't worry.

268
00:15:34,050 --> 00:15:35,610
I will definitely act with caution.

269
00:15:41,810 --> 00:15:43,450
For overseas visits, I do

270
00:15:43,530 --> 00:15:45,250
I want to ask another colleague to replace me.

271
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:46,570
I...

272
00:15:46,730 --> 00:15:48,290
I'm really busy here.

273
00:15:51,130 --> 00:15:52,170
Fine, fine, fine.

274
00:15:52,730 --> 00:15:53,690
I understand.

275
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:55,450
Leaders, please don't worry.

276
00:15:56,930 --> 00:15:57,690
OK, see you.

277
00:15:57,690 --> 00:15:58,930
See you, Deputy Governor Tang.

278
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:09,570
Is it about visiting abroad?

279
00:16:15,770 --> 00:16:17,050
We can't go out anymore.

280
00:16:26,370 --> 00:16:27,930
This cunning fellow surnamed Feng,

281
00:16:28,090 --> 00:16:29,570
his actions were too extreme!

282
00:16:35,490 --> 00:16:37,090
Although there was no fire from this Feng Yong,

283
00:16:39,450 --> 00:16:41,050
we also find it difficult to get out.

284
00:16:42,450 --> 00:16:43,730
It's just this reason

285
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,090
better.

286
00:16:46,850 --> 00:16:48,290
We were too careless.

287
00:16:51,850 --> 00:16:52,850
Now what should I do?

288
00:16:54,410 --> 00:16:55,330
Do not panic.

289
00:16:56,570 --> 00:16:57,770
Now can't get out,

290
00:16:58,090 --> 00:16:59,370
we can only think of another way.

291
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:02,730
Go away.

292
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:04,410
Calm yourself.

293
00:17:04,930 --> 00:17:06,010
Don't be gloomy.

294
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:07,850
Good.

311
00:18:58,970 --> 00:19:00,290
I'm a reporter from Nanzhou Financial Daily.

312
00:19:00,290 --> 00:19:01,130
- I want to ask... - Stop!

313
00:19:01,570 --> 00:19:02,610
Please come out.

314
00:19:04,770 --> 00:19:05,810
Please leave.

315
00:19:06,010 --> 00:19:07,010
Sorry.

320
00:19:36,130 --> 00:19:38,450
You called me at this time, not to comfort, right?

321
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:40,050
I want to ask you.

322
00:19:40,490 --> 00:19:41,530
What do you think is possible

323
00:19:41,530 --> 00:19:42,370
be the cause of the fire?

324
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,370
Sorry.

325
00:19:43,450 --> 00:19:44,090
I can't

326
00:19:44,090 --> 00:19:45,450
answer this question now.

327
00:19:45,850 --> 00:19:47,330
If I knew the cause of the fire,

328
00:19:47,330 --> 00:19:48,770
then this fire would not have happened.

329
00:19:48,770 --> 00:19:50,690
At this time something like this happened,

330
00:19:51,130 --> 00:19:51,690
you even...

331
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:52,610
It's a bit troublesome.

332
00:19:55,530 --> 00:19:56,610
Are you on site?

333
00:19:57,570 --> 00:19:58,610
Take care of your safety.

334
00:20:27,770 --> 00:20:29,370
What explanation do you want?

335
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:36,130
What explanation?

336
00:20:38,450 --> 00:20:40,090
Why not bake earlier?

337
00:20:40,810 --> 00:20:42,930
What do you mean burn it now?

338
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:44,450
I'm busy here and there,

339
00:20:44,450 --> 00:20:45,690
just cleaned it up

340
00:20:45,690 --> 00:20:46,690
the journalists.

341
00:20:47,610 --> 00:20:49,050
Then, you do this,

342
00:20:50,930 --> 00:20:51,970
You playing me?

343
00:20:53,810 --> 00:20:55,690
Suddenly there was a change.

344
00:20:57,210 --> 00:20:58,810
Even though I really don't have the heart,

345
00:21:00,290 --> 00:21:01,970
but for mutual benefit,

346
00:21:04,290 --> 00:21:05,450
Like it or not, I have to do it.

347
00:21:11,050 --> 00:21:12,370
For you, like it or not,

348
00:21:13,210 --> 00:21:14,210
then, what about me?

349
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:16,370
Car factories worth billions,

350
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:17,610
burned in one night.

351
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:20,330
As chairman of the board of directors of the Feng Group,

352
00:21:21,130 --> 00:21:22,130
I should at least give

353
00:21:22,130 --> 00:21:22,970
an explanation to

354
00:21:23,930 --> 00:21:24,850
journalists blocking the door

355
00:21:24,850 --> 00:21:26,290
and tens of thousands of existing buyers

356
00:21:26,290 --> 00:21:28,050
spend money to order a car, right?

357
00:21:28,450 --> 00:21:29,690
natural disasters,

358
00:21:31,370 --> 00:21:32,370
state of emergency,

359
00:21:34,930 --> 00:21:36,610
no one can predict it.

360
00:21:38,610 --> 00:21:40,850
Regarding media and buyers,

361
00:21:42,450 --> 00:21:43,250
company

362
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:44,850
can hold a press conference.

363
00:21:46,450 --> 00:21:47,970
Explain to the public

364
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:50,930
that three months later,

365
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:52,970
the new car will still be delivered.

366
00:21:54,690 --> 00:21:57,370
All of them are produced by German car factory assembly lines.

367
00:21:58,210 --> 00:21:59,370
All imported cars,

368
00:22:00,370 --> 00:22:01,450
the quality is higher.

369
00:22:03,090 --> 00:22:03,970
I told you,

370
00:22:05,690 --> 00:22:07,770
as long as it can get through the current crisis,

371
00:22:08,690 --> 00:22:09,810
stabilize trust

372
00:22:09,930 --> 00:22:11,530
investors and suppliers,

373
00:22:14,130 --> 00:22:15,370
three months later,

374
00:22:17,210 --> 00:22:18,210
Our Feng Group

375
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:21,370
will rise again.

376
00:22:26,690 --> 00:22:27,610
In three months

377
00:22:27,810 --> 00:22:28,770
or shorter,

378
00:22:29,450 --> 00:22:30,850
most of the Feng Group's assets

379
00:22:30,850 --> 00:22:31,970
will be run abroad.

380
00:22:32,690 --> 00:22:34,690
It's not just one or two billion anymore.

381
00:22:48,130 --> 00:22:48,850
Okay.

382
00:22:49,450 --> 00:22:50,610
Well then, let's wait.

383
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:52,250
Three months later,

384
00:22:52,770 --> 00:22:53,850
what the results will be like.

385
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,370
All medicines can be poison,

386
00:23:07,610 --> 00:23:08,530
relax a little.

387
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:26,930
All your guesses are correct.

388
00:23:28,290 --> 00:23:29,210
This is also a

389
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:30,330
an opportunity for us.

390
00:23:31,730 --> 00:23:32,610
Big Boss Feng said,

391
00:23:32,690 --> 00:23:33,370
three months later,

392
00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,650
the car will be provided by the German car factory,

393
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:35,770
that's definitely bullshit.

394
00:23:36,090 --> 00:23:37,410
What should we do next?

395
00:23:38,050 --> 00:23:39,170
Do what he says first.

396
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,130
You come back.

397
00:23:41,530 --> 00:23:42,330
We practice

398
00:23:42,330 --> 00:23:43,650
how to answer journalists' questions.

399
00:23:48,890 --> 00:23:49,970
(The cause of the fire this time)

400
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:50,930
(completely because)

401
00:23:50,930 --> 00:23:51,810
(major error occurs)

402
00:23:51,810 --> 00:23:52,930
(in group safety management.)

403
00:23:53,130 --> 00:23:54,690
(The group will assume all responsibility,)

404
00:23:55,330 --> 00:23:56,690
(will not look for excuses to avoid.)

405
00:23:57,290 --> 00:23:58,170
(We will help the police

406
00:23:58,170 --> 00:23:59,690
and firefighters in research,)

407
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:01,090
(also opens all access)

408
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:02,330
(for fellow journalists)

409
00:24:02,330 --> 00:24:03,210
(to report it.)

410
00:24:04,330 --> 00:24:05,730
The ministry concerned just now

411
00:24:05,730 --> 00:24:07,890
ordered a special investigation into new energy cars,

412
00:24:08,210 --> 00:24:09,130
Feng Group live

413
00:24:09,130 --> 00:24:10,170
there was a big fire.

414
00:24:10,770 --> 00:24:12,530
It could be said to be a precise fire.

415
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,410
This is because they have no other way,

416
00:24:17,410 --> 00:24:18,770
has reached a dead end.

417
00:24:19,970 --> 00:24:21,090
This is a solution,

418
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:23,450
we have to press harder.

419
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:24,770
A dead end is not enough,

420
00:24:25,250 --> 00:24:25,890
we have to press

421
00:24:25,890 --> 00:24:26,930
until they despair,

422
00:24:26,930 --> 00:24:27,850
take a big risk,

423
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:29,290
and more and more weaknesses are revealed.

424
00:24:32,250 --> 00:24:33,330
(Fire Clarification Press Release)

425
00:24:33,330 --> 00:24:34,770
Next is a question and answer session.

426
00:24:38,650 --> 00:24:39,850
There have been rumors lately

427
00:24:39,850 --> 00:24:41,250
that Aoxin's car technology is fake,

428
00:24:41,330 --> 00:24:41,810
Aoxin only

429
00:24:41,810 --> 00:24:42,930
to defraud funds and subsidies.

430
00:24:42,930 --> 00:24:44,010
How do you explain it?

431
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:46,610
I don't think this question needs to be explained.

432
00:24:46,930 --> 00:24:47,650
Fake or not,

433
00:24:47,650 --> 00:24:48,770
we prove it with facts.

434
00:24:49,170 --> 00:24:49,850
Here,

435
00:24:49,850 --> 00:24:50,610
I announced it to

436
00:24:50,610 --> 00:24:52,250
all buyers who have paid a down payment,

437
00:24:52,410 --> 00:24:53,570
if you don't believe us,

438
00:24:53,570 --> 00:24:55,010
please come to the shop anytime,

439
00:24:55,330 --> 00:24:56,690
to take back the entire down payment.

440
00:24:57,690 --> 00:24:58,170
For buyers

441
00:24:58,170 --> 00:24:59,090
who believes in us,

442
00:24:59,290 --> 00:25:00,770
the only promise we can give

443
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:02,690
is to hand over the car on time.

444
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,970
Next question.

445
00:25:09,410 --> 00:25:11,250
Pre-sales of Aoxin new energy cars are very hot.

446
00:25:11,490 --> 00:25:12,170
However,

447
00:25:12,170 --> 00:25:13,450
car factory assembly line this time

448
00:25:13,450 --> 00:25:15,050
suffered serious damage in the fire.

449
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,050
I'd like to ask,

450
00:25:16,130 --> 00:25:17,130
three months later,

451
00:25:17,130 --> 00:25:18,650
how does your company hand over cars?

452
00:25:19,850 --> 00:25:21,050
Thank you for your question.

453
00:25:21,610 --> 00:25:22,130
Your question

454
00:25:22,130 --> 00:25:23,010
coincidence is

455
00:25:23,010 --> 00:25:24,010
purpose we hold

456
00:25:24,010 --> 00:25:24,930
media meeting this time.

457
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:26,730
Here, I represent

458
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:28,690
Feng-Fuyong Holding Company

459
00:25:28,690 --> 00:25:29,570
officially announced,

460
00:25:30,410 --> 00:25:32,570
all Aoxin new energy cars are bespoke

461
00:25:32,730 --> 00:25:34,290
will be produced by

462
00:25:34,290 --> 00:25:35,970
Feng Group assembly line in Europe.

463
00:25:36,210 --> 00:25:37,490
If you hand over the car a day late,

464
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:38,450
we will refund

465
00:25:38,450 --> 00:25:40,050
10 percent of the total price of the car.

466
00:25:40,210 --> 00:25:41,410
If you hand over your car two days late,

467
00:25:41,410 --> 00:25:42,890
we will refund 20 percent

468
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:44,130
of the total price of the car,

469
00:25:44,130 --> 00:25:45,370
and so on.

470
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,610
Next question.

471
00:26:59,810 --> 00:27:00,930
When are you coming back?

472
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:03,010
It's been two or three days ago.

473
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:13,730
It's okay.

474
00:27:19,010 --> 00:27:20,250
Just a little unused to it.

475
00:27:23,210 --> 00:27:24,170
That's good then.

476
00:27:27,850 --> 00:27:29,050
What's looking for me?

477
00:27:36,050 --> 00:27:37,090
If there's nothing,

478
00:27:37,810 --> 00:27:38,930
I go first.

479
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:41,490
Above is holding a press conference,

480
00:27:41,770 --> 00:27:42,890
soon finished.

481
00:27:46,970 --> 00:27:47,770
Oh yes.

482
00:27:50,690 --> 00:27:52,250
In the future, it is best to reduce contact.

483
00:27:54,130 --> 00:27:55,130
He's the one

484
00:27:55,930 --> 00:27:57,690
angry and jealous.

485
00:27:58,610 --> 00:27:59,490
If found out,

486
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,290
there will be another problem later.

487
00:28:03,970 --> 00:28:04,850
Ying Ying.

488
00:28:08,410 --> 00:28:09,330
There are several things,

489
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:11,450
I still can't think of it.

490
00:28:12,570 --> 00:28:13,850
So, I came back to ask you.

491
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:19,770
Which matter?

492
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,090
Did Feng Xiaosheng threaten you?

493
00:28:31,250 --> 00:28:32,210
I told you,

494
00:28:32,850 --> 00:28:33,730
No.

495
00:28:34,130 --> 00:28:35,690
Can you tell me the truth?

496
00:28:35,690 --> 00:28:36,330
I always

497
00:28:36,330 --> 00:28:37,410
tell you honestly

498
00:28:37,570 --> 00:28:39,290
No, you always lie to me.

499
00:28:42,250 --> 00:28:43,770
Yes, you always want to win.

500
00:28:44,850 --> 00:28:46,050
However, you will not catch up

501
00:28:46,050 --> 00:28:46,930
property and wealth.

502
00:28:47,530 --> 00:28:48,050
If you

503
00:28:48,050 --> 00:28:49,490
it's like you said,

504
00:28:50,370 --> 00:28:51,370
you can't be

505
00:28:51,370 --> 00:28:52,410
a lecturer at the university.

506
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:53,850
Yang Yuze.

507
00:28:53,850 --> 00:28:55,530
At that time, I was too angry with you,

508
00:28:56,410 --> 00:28:57,970
that's why I was fooled by you.

509
00:29:04,170 --> 00:29:05,410
You are so afraid of Shen Shijie.

510
00:29:07,050 --> 00:29:07,890
You can't possibly fall in love

511
00:29:07,890 --> 00:29:09,490
at Feng Xiaosheng who was so similar to him.

512
00:29:12,850 --> 00:29:14,130
What else are you really hiding from me?

513
00:29:16,930 --> 00:29:18,330
Is it true as you say,

514
00:29:20,450 --> 00:29:21,290
Feng Xiaosheng

515
00:29:21,890 --> 00:29:23,090
really is Shen Shijie?

516
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:29,370
The words I said when my illness recurred,

517
00:29:29,450 --> 00:29:30,730
Do you believe it too?

518
00:29:32,770 --> 00:29:33,690
I believe.

519
00:29:34,930 --> 00:29:36,090
As long as your words,

520
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,650
I believe everything.

521
00:29:51,290 --> 00:29:53,690
Then, I told you I don't love you anymore,

522
00:29:54,010 --> 00:29:55,090
I have fallen in love with Feng Xiaosheng,

523
00:29:55,090 --> 00:29:56,490
why don't you want to believe?

524
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,370
Because I was once loved by you.

525
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:02,810
I know how it feels

526
00:30:02,810 --> 00:30:03,690
you love someone.

527
00:30:09,850 --> 00:30:10,650
Ying Ying.

528
00:30:14,410 --> 00:30:14,810
Can you

529
00:30:14,810 --> 00:30:15,930
give me a little confidence?

530
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:21,090
Don't bear it all alone.

531
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,170
I don't need your lies

532
00:30:25,170 --> 00:30:26,050
and your protection.

533
00:30:28,290 --> 00:30:29,570
I am a man.

534
00:30:31,050 --> 00:30:32,050
I want to protect you.

535
00:30:33,410 --> 00:30:34,330
Thank you to all of you.

536
00:30:34,530 --> 00:30:35,650
Due to time constraints,

537
00:30:35,810 --> 00:30:37,050
press conference this time

538
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:38,210
ends here.

539
00:30:38,210 --> 00:30:39,490
Thanks to CEO Feng Xiaosheng,

540
00:30:39,490 --> 00:30:41,170
Also thank you for coming to the media.

541
00:30:41,930 --> 00:30:42,770
Thank You.

542
00:30:48,050 --> 00:30:48,730
Where is Ke Ying?

543
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:52,690
I still saw him in the room earlier.

544
00:30:59,970 --> 00:31:00,880
(Incoming Call; Feng Xiaosheng)

545
00:31:14,930 --> 00:31:15,690
Mr. Meng?

546
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:17,170
What are you doing?

547
00:31:21,010 --> 00:31:21,730
It's bad, I've run away.

548
00:31:23,370 --> 00:31:24,170
Secretary An,

549
00:31:24,170 --> 00:31:25,170
Why did you have to show up now?

550
00:31:25,170 --> 00:31:26,450
I'm watching a play.

551
00:31:26,450 --> 00:31:27,250
As soon as you shout,

552
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,410
the person immediately ran away.

553
00:31:28,730 --> 00:31:29,650
The press conference has ended.

554
00:31:29,650 --> 00:31:30,770
The chairman of the board of directors is waiting for you.

555
00:31:30,970 --> 00:31:31,810
Waiting for me?

556
00:31:32,170 --> 00:31:32,730
Fine, let's go.

557
00:31:32,730 --> 00:31:33,770
Let's go quickly.

558
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:42,010
You're always hiding.

559
00:31:42,010 --> 00:31:43,050
I saw a play,

560
00:31:43,050 --> 00:31:43,850
who is hiding?

561
00:31:43,930 --> 00:31:45,010
I went to smoke.

562
00:31:46,010 --> 00:31:46,770
Sis.

563
00:31:50,450 --> 00:31:51,650
What are you doing in the hall there?

564
00:31:51,770 --> 00:31:53,330
I... I just wanted to go there to smoke.

565
00:31:53,530 --> 00:31:54,250
no,

566
00:31:54,650 --> 00:31:56,210
I happened to see a couple cheating

567
00:31:56,410 --> 00:31:57,890
were making out there.

568
00:31:58,290 --> 00:31:59,210
I'm having fun listening,

569
00:31:59,210 --> 00:32:00,210
Secretary An instead

570
00:32:00,210 --> 00:32:01,490
shouted and startled them.

571
00:32:01,490 --> 00:32:02,730
So, the play was interrupted.

572
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:04,890
Have you seen your Sis Ke?

573
00:32:04,890 --> 00:32:05,810
Of.

574
00:32:06,330 --> 00:32:07,170
Looks like it's that way.

575
00:32:07,330 --> 00:32:08,330
What is it? Something happened?

576
00:32:13,010 --> 00:32:13,730
I...

577
00:32:38,890 --> 00:32:39,650
He has gone.

578
00:32:58,370 --> 00:32:59,170
Hurry over there.

579
00:33:00,050 --> 00:33:01,330
He's looking for you everywhere.

580
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:09,530
Why are you helping me?

581
00:33:10,210 --> 00:33:11,330
Why what?

582
00:33:12,050 --> 00:33:13,410
Does helping people also need a reason?

583
00:33:14,090 --> 00:33:14,970
Miss Ke.

584
00:33:16,210 --> 00:33:17,170
In this world,

585
00:33:17,930 --> 00:33:19,090
there are still many good people.

586
00:33:20,890 --> 00:33:21,890
I know you used to...

587
00:33:24,570 --> 00:33:24,930
I know

588
00:33:24,930 --> 00:33:26,130
You didn't like me before.

589
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:29,050
However, I can swear,

590
00:33:29,610 --> 00:33:31,250
I have no evil intentions towards you.

591
00:33:38,810 --> 00:33:41,000
(Incoming Call; Feng Xiaosheng)

592
00:33:41,410 --> 00:33:42,290
Answer quickly.

593
00:33:42,930 --> 00:33:44,010
Be careful, he's suspicious.

594
00:33:49,210 --> 00:33:50,170
You go first.

595
00:33:50,730 --> 00:33:51,850
I have my own way.

596
00:34:11,890 --> 00:34:14,330
(Sorry, the number you dialed)

597
00:34:14,330 --> 00:34:16,050
(did not answer.)

598
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,600
(Try again in a moment.)

599
00:34:25,890 --> 00:34:26,770
Chairman of the Board of Directors,

600
00:34:27,010 --> 00:34:28,290
let's not look for Kak Ke anymore.

601
00:34:28,290 --> 00:34:29,250
Later the journalists come down,

602
00:34:29,250 --> 00:34:30,250
they will definitely want to interview you again.

603
00:34:43,490 --> 00:34:44,450
Mr. Feng.

604
00:34:46,600 --> 00:34:47,370
Market section

605
00:34:47,370 --> 00:34:48,570
I'll leave it to you two.

606
00:34:48,890 --> 00:34:49,490
Good.

607
00:34:49,810 --> 00:34:50,640
Watch closely.

608
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:51,970
Meeting report

609
00:34:51,970 --> 00:34:53,010
I've sent it to your email box.

610
00:34:55,890 --> 00:34:56,640
Mr. Feng,

611
00:34:56,640 --> 00:34:57,690
Miss Ke has come.

612
00:35:00,650 --> 00:35:01,570
It's finished?

613
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:02,930
Of.

614
00:35:03,130 --> 00:35:03,730
Mr. Feng,

615
00:35:03,730 --> 00:35:04,850
I'll bring the car here.

616
00:35:23,050 --> 00:35:24,010
Where are you going?

617
00:35:25,450 --> 00:35:26,210
It's stuffy inside,

618
00:35:26,210 --> 00:35:27,170
I went out to get some fresh air.

619
00:35:28,410 --> 00:35:29,490
Why don't you answer my phone?

620
00:35:30,770 --> 00:35:31,810
You called me?

621
00:35:35,930 --> 00:35:36,930
Where's my phone?

622
00:35:38,090 --> 00:35:39,130
Left it in the toilet.

623
00:35:40,130 --> 00:35:40,490
Gang,

624
00:35:40,490 --> 00:35:41,370
go to the toilet

625
00:35:41,370 --> 00:35:42,610
and look for Miss Ke's cell phone.

626
00:35:49,410 --> 00:35:50,090
How do I look

627
00:35:50,090 --> 00:35:50,690
on stage today?

628
00:35:53,210 --> 00:35:54,210
Quite good.

629
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:56,410
Quite good?

630
00:35:56,970 --> 00:35:57,850
Then, why should you?

631
00:35:58,010 --> 00:35:59,050
out looking for fresh air?

632
00:36:02,650 --> 00:36:03,650
Because I feel guilty.

633
00:36:04,690 --> 00:36:05,570
Feel guilty?

634
00:36:05,570 --> 00:36:06,530
Feeling guilty about what?

635
00:36:08,970 --> 00:36:10,650
Feel yourself rocking.

636
00:36:11,490 --> 00:36:12,210
Mr. Feng,

637
00:36:13,170 --> 00:36:14,130
have found.

638
00:36:34,210 --> 00:36:34,890
Mr. Feng,

639
00:36:35,170 --> 00:36:36,370
can i interview you for a minute?

640
00:36:37,330 --> 00:36:37,970
Master Feng!

641
00:36:39,890 --> 00:36:41,170
All news material today,

642
00:36:41,210 --> 00:36:42,490
should be enough once compiled.

643
00:36:42,490 --> 00:36:42,970
Enough.

644
00:36:42,970 --> 00:36:43,810
Enough, enough.

645
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,450
OK, you guys go home first.

646
00:36:46,690 --> 00:36:47,810
I'm going back to the office.

647
00:36:48,210 --> 00:36:49,130
OK, see you.

648
00:36:49,130 --> 00:36:49,690
See you soon.

649
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:13,210
(Sorry,)

650
00:37:13,410 --> 00:37:15,610
(the number you dialed is currently inactive.)

651
00:37:18,690 --> 00:37:19,690
Qiao Yu.

652
00:37:20,330 --> 00:37:22,130
I want to see how long you can avoid me.

653
00:37:49,690 --> 00:37:50,690
Yang Yuze!

654
00:38:12,210 --> 00:38:13,330
What is this?

655
00:38:13,970 --> 00:38:15,170
Why is he avoiding me?

656
00:38:27,970 --> 00:38:29,130
What the hell is he doing?

657
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:30,810
Just like a thief.

658
00:38:43,210 --> 00:38:44,010
Big Boss,

659
00:38:44,690 --> 00:38:46,210
since this woman named Ke Ying

660
00:38:46,210 --> 00:38:47,490
come to the company,

661
00:38:47,530 --> 00:38:48,170
chairman of the board of directors

662
00:38:48,170 --> 00:38:49,370
like different people,

663
00:38:49,650 --> 00:38:51,490
he is very obedient to her.

664
00:38:51,490 --> 00:38:52,370
As long as this woman

665
00:38:52,370 --> 00:38:53,370
don't agree,

666
00:38:54,010 --> 00:38:55,930
the chairman of the board of directors will not sign at all.

667
00:38:57,050 --> 00:38:58,170
This woman

668
00:38:58,210 --> 00:38:59,490
strange and unreasonable,

669
00:38:59,690 --> 00:39:00,970
arbitrary.

670
00:39:01,490 --> 00:39:02,850
Just came to the company,

671
00:39:03,010 --> 00:39:04,690
Department of Finance, Yuan Fenfang,

672
00:39:04,690 --> 00:39:05,690
it has been thoroughly checked by him.

673
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,010
Oh yes.

674
00:39:07,330 --> 00:39:08,890
He also asked all

675
00:39:09,170 --> 00:39:10,330
business unit data.

676
00:39:10,690 --> 00:39:11,450
The whole project

677
00:39:11,450 --> 00:39:12,810
that we invested in recently,

678
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,130
had been checked by him from start to finish.

679
00:39:23,210 --> 00:39:24,690
Who is he anyway?

680
00:39:26,210 --> 00:39:27,050
He asked,

681
00:39:28,610 --> 00:39:29,850
then, you give it all?

682
00:39:35,170 --> 00:39:36,850
The chairman of the board of directors himself asked for it,

683
00:39:37,490 --> 00:39:39,010
which subordinate dares to say what.

684
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,170
Changjun and others,

685
00:39:41,490 --> 00:39:42,490
also can't do anything.

686
00:39:42,970 --> 00:39:44,010
Truly.

687
00:39:44,130 --> 00:39:45,050
Big Boss,

688
00:39:45,170 --> 00:39:46,210
indeed the chairman of the board of directors

689
00:39:46,210 --> 00:39:47,690
himself who asked for it.

690
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:49,370
We also can't do anything.

691
00:39:49,850 --> 00:39:50,850
You also know,

692
00:39:50,850 --> 00:39:53,530
because of the incident at the board of directors meeting at the end of last year,

693
00:39:54,050 --> 00:39:55,370
everyone knows that

694
00:39:55,690 --> 00:39:57,330
the chairman of the board of directors doesn't like me.

695
00:39:58,170 --> 00:39:58,970
Big Boss,

696
00:39:59,490 --> 00:40:00,370
if not for

697
00:40:00,370 --> 00:40:01,370
your trust,

698
00:40:01,490 --> 00:40:02,210
me at all

699
00:40:02,210 --> 00:40:03,490
can't stay in the company.

700
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:05,210
In the past,

701
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:06,810
when the chairman of the board of directors is abroad,

702
00:40:07,130 --> 00:40:08,690
if everyone has an opinion,

703
00:40:09,050 --> 00:40:10,170
they still do not dare

704
00:40:10,170 --> 00:40:11,490
express it directly.

705
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:13,650
Now that the chairman of the board of directors has returned,

706
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:16,650
people started to get restless.

707
00:40:36,010 --> 00:40:38,370
Changjun's money is no longer useful.

708
00:40:39,490 --> 00:40:40,690
Before Sheng left,

709
00:40:41,650 --> 00:40:43,330
he has paved the way for him.

710
00:40:45,490 --> 00:40:47,330
To think it was even a puppet

711
00:40:48,210 --> 00:40:49,690
also not willing to handle it.

712
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:55,330
It's not that Wang Changjun is useless,

713
00:40:56,690 --> 00:40:59,210
but rather because Sheng was too authoritative in the company.

714
00:41:00,690 --> 00:41:02,490
That person can be arbitrary,

715
00:41:03,530 --> 00:41:03,970
Is not that

716
00:41:03,970 --> 00:41:05,650
because of borrowing Sheng's influence?

717
00:41:07,170 --> 00:41:08,490
That everyone trusts

718
00:41:10,690 --> 00:41:12,210
not him, but Sheng.

719
00:41:14,930 --> 00:41:16,650
Sheng, my son.

720
00:41:20,690 --> 00:41:21,610
Big Boss, sit down.

721
00:41:21,610 --> 00:41:22,490
Sit down, sit down.

722
00:41:39,050 --> 00:41:40,930
Ke Ying, this woman

723
00:41:42,210 --> 00:41:43,490
is a disaster.

724
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:47,050
Can't let it

725
00:41:48,330 --> 00:41:50,490
berada di sisi Shen Shijie lagi.

726
00:41:51,610 --> 00:41:52,690
He is malicious.

727
00:42:00,010 --> 00:42:01,010
However, that person,

728
00:42:02,210 --> 00:42:03,810
now really appreciate it.

729
00:42:05,130 --> 00:42:06,650
The two never parted,

730
00:42:06,650 --> 00:42:08,410
whatever you do, always together.

731
00:42:10,810 --> 00:42:11,970
Want to find an opportunity to

732
00:42:11,970 --> 00:42:12,970
giving up is difficult.

733
00:42:14,690 --> 00:42:15,530
Besides that,

734
00:42:17,530 --> 00:42:18,810
previous failure,

735
00:42:19,810 --> 00:42:21,570
already made the person alert.

736
00:42:22,690 --> 00:42:24,090
Always be careful wherever you are.

737
00:42:25,410 --> 00:42:26,570
It's a bit difficult to do.

738
00:42:29,450 --> 00:42:30,850
He hired Gang again?

739
00:42:33,090 --> 00:42:33,890
Correct.

740
00:42:36,370 --> 00:42:37,690
I don't know what else appeals

741
00:42:37,690 --> 00:42:39,210
which he used on Gang.

742
00:42:40,970 --> 00:42:43,050
Now he is indifferent to me.

743
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:45,530
Not responding to Wechat,

744
00:42:47,050 --> 00:42:48,970
didn't even take my call.

745
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:54,170
Actually,

746
00:42:56,610 --> 00:42:57,210
I think we are

747
00:42:57,210 --> 00:42:58,570
you can change your mindset.

748
00:42:59,810 --> 00:43:01,330
Don't have to do it

749
00:43:01,330 --> 00:43:02,850
brutal action on Ke Ying.

750
00:43:04,490 --> 00:43:06,130
This cursed couple is none other than that

751
00:43:07,410 --> 00:43:08,930
just taking advantage of each other.

752
00:43:10,450 --> 00:43:12,210
Not necessarily inseparable.

753
00:43:14,010 --> 00:43:15,650
We just need to stay away

754
00:43:16,490 --> 00:43:17,690
these two people,

755
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,050
