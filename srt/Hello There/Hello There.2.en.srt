Sir, please come in.

This way, please.

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:00,340
Okay.

8
00:01:00,340 --> 00:01:00,940
This way.

9
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:04,930
Brother,

10
00:01:05,459 --> 00:01:07,020
since you came back yesterday,

11
00:01:07,060 --> 00:01:08,380
you've taken shower at least three times.

12
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:10,539
Did you fall into a cesspool?

13
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:12,700
I thought food could shut you up.

14
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:18,539
Pick them up.

15
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:19,539
No.

16
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:24,020
Don't think you can threaten me with that whip.

17
00:01:24,539 --> 00:01:25,420
I'm just too hungry.

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:26,460
Otherwise, I wouldn't be so obedient

19
00:01:26,539 --> 00:01:27,500
even if you beat me up.

20
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:30,140
You took me down the mountain

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:31,380
but went to have fun at night alone.

22
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:32,500
Have you taken me

23
00:01:32,500 --> 00:01:33,420
as your brother or not?

24
00:01:34,100 --> 00:01:36,340
You and I are on the verge of insanity after practicing the skills in the Book of Xincan.

25
00:01:37,060 --> 00:01:39,060
Only the Book of Yueque which has the same origin as it

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,060
can help us retain sanity.

27
00:01:40,539 --> 00:01:42,860
Ruoyu found that the Tang Sect's martial arts skills

28
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:44,300
are similar to those in the Book of Yueque.

29
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:46,580
I sneaked into the Tang Sect last night.

30
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,340
But someone got in my way

31
00:01:50,539 --> 00:01:51,700
and I found nothing.

32
00:01:53,050 --> 00:01:54,330
What a surprise.

33
00:01:54,820 --> 00:01:55,979
That guy must be very capable.

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:57,420
I'd like to meet him.

35
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:24,900
Hi, there. We meet again.

36
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,540
You ugly monster.

37
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,100
I didn't go after you

38
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:30,500
but you came to me yourself.

39
00:02:31,220 --> 00:02:31,860
You...

40
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:32,860
I...

41
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:37,140
Did you just call me ugly?

42
00:02:37,340 --> 00:02:38,980
You're the ugliest one here!

43
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:42,250
So you're not only ugly

44
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,930
but also blind!

45
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:46,620
I was merciful the other day.

46
00:02:47,100 --> 00:02:50,340
I won't go easy one you this time.

47
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:53,900
Wait.

48
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,660
Brother, I'm protecting myself.

49
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:02,380
You won't tie me up, will you?

50
00:03:02,460 --> 00:03:03,300
Don't draw blood.

51
00:03:03,340 --> 00:03:04,220
OK.

52
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:06,780
I have 100 ways

53
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:08,500
to kill people without drawing blood.

54
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:10,700
How dare you look down on me?

55
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:13,620
Brothers, teach him a hard lesson.

56
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,740
Young lad,

57
00:04:01,060 --> 00:04:01,890
you'd better know the score here.

58
00:04:02,500 --> 00:04:03,780
Now that you're in Shu,

59
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:06,060
you should go by the rules of Shu.

60
00:04:06,980 --> 00:04:08,380
You should thank God

61
00:04:08,740 --> 00:04:10,660
that you caught my eye.

62
00:04:20,610 --> 00:04:21,450
What are you doing?

63
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:25,180
Dirty.

64
00:04:35,340 --> 00:04:36,140
Do you hear that?

65
00:04:36,700 --> 00:04:39,180
Your brother should be a warning to you.

66
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:41,980
So you'd better play nice.

67
00:04:42,700 --> 00:04:44,260
Otherwise...

68
00:04:55,220 --> 00:04:55,780
Brother.

69
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:57,620
How is that? Neat, right?

70
00:05:10,140 --> 00:05:11,100
Now it's neat.

71
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:12,700
You noticed trivial details like those?

72
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,260
Your obsession with neatness is incurable.

73
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:15,780
You...

74
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,660
What?

75
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,420
Who allowed you to sit next to my brother?

76
00:05:18,500 --> 00:05:19,140
Get out!

77
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:21,540
Fine. I'll go.

78
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:23,700
It's no big deal.

79
00:05:27,260 --> 00:05:28,490
Where are my sugar cakes?

80
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:29,900
You ugly monster.

81
00:05:29,900 --> 00:05:30,780
How dare you eat my cakes?

82
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:31,540
Stop!

83
00:05:31,940 --> 00:05:33,020
Sorry. Sorry.

84
00:05:33,020 --> 00:05:33,860
I'm sorry. Don't hit me.

85
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:35,180
I'm sorry.

86
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,020
Sorry.

87
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:38,540
Don't hit me.

88
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:50,900
Sparing your enemy's face is basic courtesy.

89
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:52,580
Don't you know the rules of fights?

90
00:06:31,140 --> 00:06:32,540
Please, don't notice me.

91
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:33,060
Stop.

92
00:06:36,540 --> 00:06:38,420
Sir, please spare my life.

93
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:42,100
I didn't mean to pick a fight.

94
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:44,500
I just wanted to see whether you're well-trained.

95
00:06:44,659 --> 00:06:45,300
Yeah.

96
00:06:45,540 --> 00:06:47,340
The Tang Sect is recruiting martial arts masters

97
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,420
as senior guards.

98
00:06:48,659 --> 00:06:50,580
I noticed that both of you were very capable,

99
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:52,060
so I came to invite you

100
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:53,810
to be guards in the Tang Sect.

101
00:06:53,810 --> 00:06:54,850
You're from the Tang Sect?

102
00:06:57,740 --> 00:06:58,540
Is he…

103
00:06:59,220 --> 00:07:01,460
Is he intimidated by my background?

104
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:07,420
Yeah. The Tang Sect is the greatest sect in Shu.

105
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:11,220
I am the famous young mistress of the Tang Sect,

106

Tang Buyan.

107
00:07:13,180 --> 00:07:14,140
I'm here

108

to test your skills.

109
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:18,610
Looks like you're not interested.

110
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:20,340
Then I'll take my leave.

111
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:21,540
No need to walk me out.

112
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:24,740
I didn't let you go.

113
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:28,020
Sir, please spare my life. Don't kill me.

114
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:29,260
What I said is true.

115
00:07:29,540 --> 00:07:31,260
I swear.

116
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:31,900

You have no idea how rare it is.

123
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:52,340
It only grows one inch in ten years.

124

I'm hungry. Do you have anything delicious?

128

Give it to me.

Guard Han, since you've become one of us,

136
00:08:28,810 --> 00:08:30,490
you must follow the rules of the Tang Sect.

137

You should do what I say.

138
00:08:32,299 --> 00:08:34,490
Otherwise, I can kick you out

139
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:35,940
just like I can invite you in.

140
00:08:36,299 --> 00:08:36,900
Do you hear me?

141
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:39,580
Okay.

142
00:08:43,659 --> 00:08:44,300

Senior sister.

144

I heard you brought someone back.

This is the young man I told you about.

I'm Li Han. My brother is Li Yan.

148
00:08:57,860 --> 00:09:00,130
Yan said that you and your brother are highly skilled in martial arts.

149
00:09:00,420 --> 00:09:02,340
Why are you willing to be guards here?

150
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:04,420
We passed this place and ran out of money.

151
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:06,900
Young Mistress earnestly invited us to work here,

152
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:08,530
so we didn't refuse.

153
00:09:08,900 --> 00:09:09,580
But...

154
00:09:09,770 --> 00:09:10,460
Senior sister.

155
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:15,580
Fine. Since that's the case,

156
00:09:15,940 --> 00:09:18,660
go to Yan's house and get some rest.

157
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,860
Thank you, senior sister.

158
00:09:20,090 --> 00:09:22,180
Let's go. I'll take you to your room.

159

This way.

Check their background carefully.

161

Yes, senior sister.

162
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,980
Li Han is in good shape.

163
00:10:18,900 --> 00:10:20,460
I have to say,

164
00:10:21,380 --> 00:10:23,340
he's not a bad match for me.

165
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:44,940
It worked so quickly?

166
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:55,580
No matter how capable you are,

167
00:10:56,020 --> 00:10:57,660
once I use the smoke to knock you out,

168
00:10:58,260 --> 00:11:00,130
you're fish in the barrel.

Breaking in when I'm having a bath

170

are the best in the martial arts world.

305

00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,220
The book's name

322
00:25:10,700 --> 00:25:11,730

323
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,700
Three words?

324
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:14,580
