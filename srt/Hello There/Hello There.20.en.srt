[Episode 20]

4
00:00:59,620 --> 00:01:00,220
Xue.

5
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:01,700
You've stayed in there for too long.

6
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:02,740
Come out and eat something.

7
00:01:18,380 --> 00:01:19,340
Be quiet.

8
00:02:16,579 --> 00:02:18,140
Are you sure this is proper?

9
00:02:19,130 --> 00:02:20,860
Of course.

10
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:22,890
This is what practicing together means.

11
00:02:41,700 --> 00:02:43,090
Brother, I'm coming in.

12
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,579
Brother, I've made great progress in practicing the Book of Yueque.

13
00:02:52,820 --> 00:02:54,650
Okay. I got it.

14
00:02:56,380 --> 00:02:57,820
You may leave now.

15
00:02:58,620 --> 00:02:59,420
Who is there?

16
00:03:00,260 --> 00:03:02,660
You woke me up at such an ungodly hour.

17
00:03:07,540 --> 00:03:10,100
Why are you guys here?

18
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,180
By nature, we desire food and sex.

19
00:03:15,980 --> 00:03:16,620
What's wrong with him?

20
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:19,060
He's been like this since he woke up.

21
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:20,540
I don't know what's wrong with him either.

22
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,700
Why did you sound so sarcastic?

23
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:27,500
Yeah, I slept with your brother. So what?

24
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:30,500
Don't worry. I'll be responsible for him.

25
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:34,180
Be careful with what you look at.

26
00:03:34,370 --> 00:03:35,180
Be careful with what you listen to.

27
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:36,180
Always have a sense of propriety.

28
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:39,780
Sorry for bothering you.

29
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:42,500
Xue.

30
00:03:43,460 --> 00:03:44,060
He...

31
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,700
Why is Yun Gaixue so odd today?

32
00:03:49,860 --> 00:03:51,170
Forget it.

33
00:03:51,980 --> 00:03:53,660
How do you feel after we practiced together last night?

34
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:54,820
Anything different?

35
00:03:56,220 --> 00:03:58,820
I feel full of energy now.

36
00:04:01,300 --> 00:04:02,820
Why do I feel tired so quickly?

37
00:04:03,980 --> 00:04:06,460
Did we not practice long enough?

38
00:04:06,780 --> 00:04:07,780
Come.

39
00:04:13,700 --> 00:04:14,420
Xue.

40
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:16,019
Your brother and Tang Buyan

41
00:04:16,019 --> 00:04:17,579
practiced too late last night.

42
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:18,930
That's why they slept together…

43
00:04:18,980 --> 00:04:20,100
em, slept in the same room.

44
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:21,220
Don't overthink.

45
00:04:21,450 --> 00:04:23,180
Don't worry.

46
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:27,660
I understand the bedroom stuff.

47
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:29,940
They were just practicing intimate skills.

48
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,340
Where did you learn that?

49
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:36,820
It's easy.

50
00:04:37,340 --> 00:04:38,460
It's human nature.

51
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,140
Who are you?

52
00:04:42,380 --> 00:04:43,700
Where is the old Xue?

53
00:04:46,420 --> 00:04:48,980
There are lines in the Book of Yueque that I don't understand.

54
00:04:49,580 --> 00:04:51,780
I need to continue my training. Excuse me.

55
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:18,060
Go get ready.

56
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:25,300
Xue is behaving so differently

57
00:05:25,580 --> 00:05:27,260
because his personality had changed drastically

58
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:28,580
after he practiced the Book of Xincan.

59
00:05:28,700 --> 00:05:30,820
And now that he's made great progress in practicing the Book of Yueque,

60
00:05:30,980 --> 00:05:32,050
he became his old self again.

61
00:05:32,420 --> 00:05:33,220
His old self?

62
00:05:34,100 --> 00:05:37,460
Well, the true Yun Gaixue keeps reminding me of a monk.

63
00:05:40,380 --> 00:05:41,180
The Book of Yueque works so quickly?

64
00:05:42,780 --> 00:05:43,820
Let's go, Li Chengxi.

65
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:45,220
Let's go practice together.

66
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:49,540
Maybe my disease can be cured

67
00:05:49,659 --> 00:05:51,020
if we practice together more often.

68
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,659
I need to take you to a place first.

69
00:06:41,380 --> 00:06:42,780
Did he prepare all these

70
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:45,460
because he's afraid that I may turn my back on him someday?

71
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:49,409
Yan.

72
00:06:50,220 --> 00:06:50,860
I...

73
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:51,930
Don't worry.

74
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,380
Since we've practiced together,

75
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,980
I will be responsible for you.

76
00:06:59,180 --> 00:07:00,220
Don't you believe me?

77
00:07:00,700 --> 00:07:02,620
Then, in half a month...

78
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:04,100
No, in three days.

79
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:06,300
Let's get married in three days.

80
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:14,980
Li Chengxi.

81
00:07:15,340 --> 00:07:16,820
I'm not a martial arts master like you,

82
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,500
but as long as we're together,

83
00:07:18,700 --> 00:07:20,860
I'll protect you with my life.

84
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:23,140
After we get married,

85
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,980
I'll move the Tang Sect to Xuanqi Mountain.

86
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:29,300
You'll be in charge of the internal affairs.

87
00:07:29,700 --> 00:07:30,420
As for me,

88
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:32,050
I'll be in charge of money.

89
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:33,540
And…

90
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,340
You call the shots.

♫The east wind blows through calm and good times♫

92
00:07:37,300 --> 00:07:38,020

Form is emptiness.

00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,059
Emptiness is form.

117
00:08:45,780 --> 00:08:46,620
When are you going to

118
00:08:46,620 --> 00:08:47,820
return the old Xue to me?

119
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:49,220
Return Xue to me!

120
00:08:49,460 --> 00:08:51,660
Return him!

121
00:08:56,540 --> 00:08:57,380
Childish.

122
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:05,900
-Bravo! -Bravo!

123
00:09:11,620 --> 00:09:13,370
-Bravo! -Bravo!

124
00:10:22,820 --> 00:10:23,420
What do you think?

125
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:25,140
You look very beautiful.

126
00:10:35,020 --> 00:10:35,820
Sir.

127
00:10:37,540 --> 00:10:38,060
Sir,

128
00:10:38,140 --> 00:10:39,500
someone who is badly injured outside

129
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,370
asked to see you.

130
00:10:40,460 --> 00:10:42,740
He said he's an old friend of you and Miss Tang.

131
00:10:51,540 --> 00:10:52,340
Why are you dressed like that?

132
00:10:56,460 --> 00:10:58,540
Li Chengxi and I are getting married tomorrow.

133
00:11:03,540 --> 00:11:04,820
I wish nothing but a happy life for you.

134
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,220
Of course we'll live a happy life.

135
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:09,460
Mr. Li,

136
00:11:09,810 --> 00:11:11,420
you're not welcome here in Xuanqi Mountain.

137
00:11:17,140 --> 00:11:18,580
I know you don't want to see me,

138
00:11:19,340 --> 00:11:20,300
but I had to come.

139
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:21,300
Li Chengtian…

140
00:11:25,260 --> 00:11:26,700
Li Chengtian will come after you.

141
00:11:28,090 --> 00:11:29,300
You must be careful.

142
00:11:31,980 --> 00:11:33,580
I know I was wrong.

143
00:11:33,980 --> 00:11:35,180
I was too selfish.

144
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,460
But

145
00:11:37,020 --> 00:11:38,340
Li Chengtian has been secretly planning

146
00:11:38,340 --> 00:11:39,500
to take the Book of Yueque away from your hands.

147
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,730
He knows that you two gentlemen are highly skilled in martial arts,

148
00:11:43,260 --> 00:11:44,540
so he plans to make you the target.

149
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:47,700
I tried my best to come here

150
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:49,140
to tell you

151
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:50,020
that I...

152
00:11:54,740 --> 00:11:56,020
Please believe me.

153
00:11:57,300 --> 00:11:58,100
Mr. Li,

154
00:11:59,260 --> 00:12:00,780
please keep Yan safe.

155
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:09,300
Of course I will.

156
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,340
I'm relieved to hear that.

157
00:12:17,180 --> 00:12:18,530
I know you don't welcome me.

158
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:20,500
Now that I've given you the warning,

159
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
I should take my leave.

160
00:12:32,500 --> 00:12:33,420
Let me check on him.

161
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:46,540
He is indeed badly injured,

162
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:49,740
and there's still the Book of Xincan's power left in his body.

163
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,060
It seems that he was indeed hurt by Li Chengtian.

164
00:12:53,500 --> 00:12:55,860
Why don't we let him stay?

165
00:12:56,060 --> 00:12:58,180
We can send him away immediately after he gets better.

166
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:00,700
Okay.

167
00:13:21,980 --> 00:13:22,780
Sorry.

168
00:13:23,340 --> 00:13:24,140
I didn't know

169
00:13:25,420 --> 00:13:26,860
you were getting married tomorrow.

170
00:13:27,700 --> 00:13:28,500
I'm leaving now.

171
00:13:29,260 --> 00:13:30,060
It's okay.

172
00:13:30,540 --> 00:13:31,620
You got hurt

173
00:13:31,650 --> 00:13:32,980
because of us.

174
00:13:34,820 --> 00:13:36,260
That's what I should do.

175
00:13:37,420 --> 00:13:38,340
I'll go back now.

176
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:39,940
Take care of yourselves.

177
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:44,700
You're too weak

178
00:13:44,860 --> 00:13:45,700
to go anywhere now.

179
00:13:46,340 --> 00:13:47,900
Just stay and have a good rest.

180
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:52,420
In that case,

181
00:13:53,260 --> 00:13:54,940
I'll feel very honored to attend your wedding.

182
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,300
Mr. Li?

183
00:14:24,940 --> 00:14:25,820
What are you doing here?

184
00:14:26,980 --> 00:14:28,140
I stayed indoors for too long,

185
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:29,620
so I came out for a walk

186
00:14:29,820 --> 00:14:30,620
to have a stretch.

187
00:14:31,180 --> 00:14:32,380
I didn't expect to get tired so quickly.

188
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:34,860
I'll be fine after some rest.

189
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:35,860
Don't mind me.

190
00:14:35,980 --> 00:14:37,450
It's okay. Let me help you back.

191
00:14:40,260 --> 00:14:41,060
Be careful.

192
00:14:52,260 --> 00:14:52,900
Hurry up.

193
00:14:53,010 --> 00:14:53,700
Coming.

194
00:14:53,780 --> 00:14:54,220
Here.

195
00:14:54,500 --> 00:14:55,100
Give me that.

196
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:55,730
Okay.

197
00:14:55,980 --> 00:14:56,770
This way.

198
00:14:57,180 --> 00:14:57,860
Be careful.

199
00:14:58,940 --> 00:14:59,820
Don't spill the wine.

200
00:15:00,100 --> 00:15:00,860
Higher.

201
00:15:02,060 --> 00:15:02,860
Okay.

202
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,820
Just hang it there.

203
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:04,900
Okay, to the left.

204
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,940
It's the Bone Softening Powder.

205
00:15:41,740 --> 00:15:43,010
This poison is colorless and odorless.

206
00:15:43,260 --> 00:15:44,100
It can't be noticed

207
00:15:44,290 --> 00:15:45,530
until it attacks your immune system.

208
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:46,370
No.

209
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:47,820
Yan is in danger.

210
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:51,900
I warned you,

211
00:15:52,860 --> 00:15:54,580
but you still failed to protect Yan.

212
00:15:54,940 --> 00:15:55,980
Put me down!

213
00:15:57,820 --> 00:15:58,540
Li Jian.

214
00:15:59,260 --> 00:16:00,140
What do you want?

215
00:16:06,420 --> 00:16:06,940
Yan!

216
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Let go of me!

217
00:16:08,340 --> 00:16:09,540
I won't let you leave me again.

218
00:16:14,780 --> 00:16:16,820
How are you going to protect her

219
00:16:17,100 --> 00:16:18,300
if you succumbed to the Bone Softening Powder so easily?

220
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:20,980
Since you can't protect her,

221
00:16:21,490 --> 00:16:22,980
I will do that.

222
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:23,900
Li Jian,

223
00:16:24,340 --> 00:16:25,690
don't flatter yourself.

224
00:16:25,690 --> 00:16:27,180
I don't need your protection.

225
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:05,220
Li Chengtian.

226
00:17:06,339 --> 00:17:07,859
Well done.

227
00:17:10,380 --> 00:17:12,260
Just remember what you promised me.

228
00:17:15,900 --> 00:17:16,740
Physician Yan,

229
00:17:17,420 --> 00:17:18,700
if you move again,

230
00:17:19,099 --> 00:17:21,260
I can't guarantee that my guards won't hurt you.

231
00:17:22,619 --> 00:17:23,540
Give them to me.

232
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,460
Li Chengxi,

233
00:17:28,980 --> 00:17:30,340
hand over the Book of Yueque.

234
00:17:30,620 --> 00:17:32,180
Otherwise, all of them will die.

235
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:33,700
Li Chengtian,

236
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:35,820
you are a sect chief.

237
00:17:36,340 --> 00:17:37,540
You should help the weak

238
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:39,100
and benefit the martial arts world.

239
00:17:39,780 --> 00:17:41,860
How can you fight and kill for your own interests?

240
00:17:49,580 --> 00:17:50,380
Li Chengtian,

241
00:17:51,300 --> 00:17:52,540
you want the Book of Yueque.

242
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,380
Fine.

243
00:17:54,340 --> 00:17:55,580
But you have to let them go first.

244
00:17:55,820 --> 00:17:57,940
You're not in a place to bargain with me.

245
00:18:00,740 --> 00:18:02,740
Li Chengtian, you promised me.

246
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:04,180
She's just a woman.

247
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,100
I'll return her to you after I'm done.

248
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:07,900
Cut the crap.

249
00:18:08,340 --> 00:18:09,340
Kill me if you dare.

250
00:18:09,980 --> 00:18:10,580
You think I don't dare?

251
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,180
Stop!

252
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:14,180
Li Chengtian, don't you want the Book of Yueque?

253
00:18:15,060 --> 00:18:15,780
I'll give it to you.

254
00:18:16,850 --> 00:18:19,210
[The Book of Yueque]

255
00:18:18,780 --> 00:18:20,420
Take it.

256
00:18:23,900 --> 00:18:24,420
Yan.

257
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,660
The Book of Yueque. It's really the Book of Yueque.

258
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,660
Back then, your father

259
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,900
kneeled in front of me

260
00:18:42,930 --> 00:18:44,220
like you're doing right now

261
00:18:44,300 --> 00:18:46,220
and let me drain his energy.

262
00:18:48,020 --> 00:18:48,740
What did you say?

263
00:18:49,860 --> 00:18:50,380
Oh,

264
00:18:51,970 --> 00:18:53,100
you don't know it, do you?

265
00:18:54,620 --> 00:18:55,940
I was the one

266
00:18:55,980 --> 00:18:57,140
who should've been abandoned.

267
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,420
I was the Shadow.

268
00:19:01,740 --> 00:19:03,620
We're both the sons of the chief of the Lingjue Sect.

269
00:19:04,420 --> 00:19:06,380
I was born merely three minutes later than him.

270
00:19:07,660 --> 00:19:09,380
But why was I destined to be the Shadow?

271
00:19:09,410 --> 00:19:11,090
Why didn't I deserve the surname Li?

272
00:19:11,140 --> 00:19:13,860
Why was I destined to be drained of my energy?

273
00:19:17,140 --> 00:19:18,260
My fate

274
00:19:18,980 --> 00:19:20,580
should be controlled by myself.

275
00:19:24,500 --> 00:19:26,220
Answer killing with killing will get you nowhere.

276
00:19:26,700 --> 00:19:28,420
You should get over the past

277
00:19:29,420 --> 00:19:30,660
and stop killing.

278
00:19:37,500 --> 00:19:38,300
Li Chengxi!

279
00:19:55,980 --> 00:19:57,060
The Book of Xinyue

280
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,820
is so powerful.

281
00:20:01,460 --> 00:20:02,060
Take him down!

282
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:38,940
Go to hell!

283
00:20:59,380 --> 00:21:00,100
Li Jian!

284
00:21:02,740 --> 00:21:03,500
Li Jian.

285
00:21:05,540 --> 00:21:06,340
Li Jian.

286
00:21:11,860 --> 00:21:12,660
Li Jian.

287
00:21:14,740 --> 00:21:16,260
Why did you...

288
00:21:19,140 --> 00:21:20,060
You are

289
00:21:21,340 --> 00:21:22,660
my last light.

290
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:27,740
Yan,

291
00:21:29,740 --> 00:21:30,540
please,

292
00:21:31,980 --> 00:21:32,620
please

293
00:21:34,010 --> 00:21:35,460
be happy.

294
00:21:51,450 --> 00:21:52,220
Li Jian!

295
00:21:54,860 --> 00:21:55,660
Li Jian!

296
00:21:57,420 --> 00:21:58,220
Li Jian!

297
00:22:01,530 --> 00:22:02,380
Useless thing.

298
00:22:03,180 --> 00:22:04,940
You gave up your life for a woman!

299
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:11,860
Sister-in-law.

300
00:22:16,580 --> 00:22:17,420
Li Chengxi.

301
00:22:19,060 --> 00:22:20,980
Li Yuan made me lose everything back then.

302
00:22:22,180 --> 00:22:22,860
Today,

303
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,420
I will let you lose everything too.

304
00:22:27,460 --> 00:22:28,620
Kill them!

305
00:22:40,580 --> 00:22:41,250
Li Chengtian!

306
00:22:42,940 --> 00:22:43,860
Do you want to save them?

307
00:22:44,260 --> 00:22:45,580
I'll give you a chance now.

308
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:47,100
If you kill one of them,

309
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:48,620
I'll let the other person go.

310
00:22:58,060 --> 00:22:58,940
If not,

311
00:22:59,460 --> 00:23:00,620
both of them will have to die.

312
00:23:12,940 --> 00:23:13,500
Fine.

313
00:23:14,580 --> 00:23:16,180
Since you can't decide,

314
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,580
I'll make the decision for you.

315
00:23:19,220 --> 00:23:20,020
Wait.

316
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:21,540
Li Chengxi.

317
00:23:22,060 --> 00:23:23,490
I'm already dying.

318
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:24,700
I can't live long.

319
00:23:24,900 --> 00:23:25,900
Choose Yun Gaixue.

320
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:27,180
I won't blame you.

321
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:31,340
Sister-in-law,

322
00:23:32,140 --> 00:23:33,170
you are wrong.

323
00:23:33,540 --> 00:23:34,540
All beings are equal.

324
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:36,780
We should all strive to survive.

325
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,900
Cut the crap.

326
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:39,540
Yun Gaixue,

327
00:23:39,780 --> 00:23:41,420
I'll send you to hell now.

328
00:23:42,140 --> 00:23:42,940
No!

329
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,020
♫Is it right or wrong to let go♫

330
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:59,910
♫With a heart beating warm but pretending to be cold♫

331
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:56,060

Yan.

♫Whether I lose you or keep you♫

♫We can't escape the torture♫

336

Yan.

337
00:24:07,380 --> 00:24:08,420
You'll be fine.

338
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:09,730
Remember?

339
00:24:10,220 --> 00:24:11,740
We've found the Book the Yueque.

Even if you keep injecting your inner power into her body,

you are only able to keep her heart beating.
