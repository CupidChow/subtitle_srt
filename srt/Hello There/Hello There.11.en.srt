172
00:09:43,460 --> 00:09:45,310
♫Seas and fields♫

173
00:09:45,310 --> 00:09:47,410
♫Can't change♫

174
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:49,130
♫What I would do for you♫

175
00:09:49,130 --> 00:09:50,980
♫Keep the vow♫

176
00:09:50,980 --> 00:09:54,380
♫Let's forget the twists and turns♫

177
00:09:54,380 --> 00:10:00,890
♫Rejoice in our wonderful encounter♫

178
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:11,060
Where's my brother?

179
00:10:11,300 --> 00:10:12,180
I can't find him.

180
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:16,940
But I can stall Shen Yi.

181
00:10:19,060 --> 00:10:20,740
Does your allergy medicine work?

182
00:10:21,860 --> 00:10:23,100
You'll know later.

183
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,500
Let me tell you.

184
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:25,340
I offended the Fengming Pavilion manager

185
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,140
because of you.

186
00:10:27,500 --> 00:10:29,100
Remember what you promised me.

187
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:29,900
Cut the crap.

188
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:31,580
I'm just trying your new medicine like a guinea pig.

189
00:10:31,700 --> 00:10:32,180
Got it.

190
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:52,100
Why does this outfit look so familiar?

191
00:10:53,620 --> 00:10:54,100
Forget it.

192
00:10:54,660 --> 00:10:56,260
As long as my Dear Li likes it.

193
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:57,500
Besides,

194
00:10:57,780 --> 00:10:59,420
no matter what outfit I wear,

195
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:00,980
I'm beautiful.

196
00:11:24,660 --> 00:11:25,740
My beautiful face!

197
00:11:26,690 --> 00:11:27,530
What's going on?

198
00:11:45,220 --> 00:11:46,980
Why is my heart beating like this again?

199
00:11:47,460 --> 00:11:49,100
I even have a fever.

200
00:11:49,620 --> 00:11:51,660
What's wrong with me?

201
00:11:54,260 --> 00:11:54,850
Yan.

202
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,140
I...

203
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,060
Tang Buyan.

204
00:11:58,300 --> 00:11:59,100
What are you doing?

205
00:12:05,620 --> 00:12:07,500
Shen Yi, you're finally here.

206
00:12:07,620 --> 00:12:09,260
Something went wrong just now.

207
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:09,700
I...

208
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,460
I think you're the biggest problem.

209
00:12:12,020 --> 00:12:13,500
If you like Li Chengxi, you should have told me earlier.

210
00:12:13,820 --> 00:12:15,380
Let's compete fair and square.

211
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:17,060
What are you doing now?

212
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:19,340
On the surface, you said you would help me pursue Li Chengxi,

213
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,460
but in fact,

214
00:12:20,660 --> 00:12:22,060
you were plotting away this whole time.

215
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,850
You are really scheming.

216
00:12:24,940 --> 00:12:26,300
What do you mean?

217
00:12:26,660 --> 00:12:27,660
What are you talking about?

218
00:12:27,900 --> 00:12:28,860
This date was prepared

219
00:12:28,860 --> 00:12:30,260
for you two.

220
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:32,100
It was an accident.

221
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:32,940
Enough.

222
00:12:35,180 --> 00:12:36,100
Manager Shen.

223
00:12:37,020 --> 00:12:37,940
I'm not at Fengming Pavilion

224
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,660
for love

225
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:41,660
but to buy information.

226
00:12:42,340 --> 00:12:43,140
So please

227
00:12:43,380 --> 00:12:45,220
stop using these tactics.

228
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,770
Also,

229
00:12:47,610 --> 00:12:48,420
Miss Tang,

230
00:12:50,180 --> 00:12:51,000
please respect yourself.

231
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:53,780
Li Chengxi.

232
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,020
Even if it was an accident,

233
00:13:11,500 --> 00:13:12,660
you also messed up

234
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:14,380
the third thing.

235
00:13:15,020 --> 00:13:15,980
However,

236
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,980
I'm generous.

237
00:13:18,340 --> 00:13:19,940
I can give you another chance.

238
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:23,100
I still need to think about

239
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:24,980
how I can get to Dear Li's heart.

240
00:13:25,820 --> 00:13:26,620
Remember,

241
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:28,540
you still owe me one.

242
00:13:42,700 --> 00:13:43,500
Young Master.

243
00:13:45,300 --> 00:13:46,100
Young Master.

244
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:49,460
Young Master.

245
00:13:49,740 --> 00:13:50,860
I haven't found any ancient script

246
00:13:50,860 --> 00:13:52,380
in other places.

247
00:13:52,770 --> 00:13:53,900
But I heard that

248
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:55,780
there is a secret warehouse in Fengming Pavilion

249
00:13:56,220 --> 00:13:57,740
which contains the most valuable information.

250
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:58,450
Okay.

251
00:13:59,260 --> 00:14:01,100
Find someone who understands the ancient script as soon as possible,

252
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:02,740
and leave Fengming Pavilion.

253
00:14:03,220 --> 00:14:03,860
Tomorrow night,

254
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:06,260
I'll find out where the secret vault is.

255
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:07,890
Alright.

256
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:23,740
Mr. Li.

257
00:14:24,380 --> 00:14:25,500
You're still up.

258
00:14:26,340 --> 00:14:27,420
Are you still angry?

259
00:14:33,500 --> 00:14:34,370
I'm sorry.

260
00:14:34,620 --> 00:14:36,420
I made a big mistake today.

261
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:38,580
So you should be mad at me.

262
00:14:39,010 --> 00:14:39,500
But

263
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:42,060
you should give me a chance to apologize.

264
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,460
What did you do wrong?

265
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:50,380
I...

266
00:14:51,340 --> 00:14:52,220
I shouldn't have

267
00:14:54,180 --> 00:14:57,140
kept it from you.

268
00:14:58,300 --> 00:14:59,100
Yes.

269
00:14:59,540 --> 00:15:01,340
I should have told you earlier

270
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,780
that this date was actually specially

271
00:15:02,780 --> 00:15:03,820
prepared for you by Shen Yi.

272
00:15:04,060 --> 00:15:05,180
Then, it wouldn't have been

273
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:06,220
such an awkward situation.

274
00:15:06,260 --> 00:15:07,460
There's no need to explain further.

275
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:08,940
I'm tired.

276
00:15:09,220 --> 00:15:09,940
Rest early.

277
00:15:11,370 --> 00:15:11,860
But...

278
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:16,900
My nose...

279
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:25,300
Why did I make him even angrier?

280
00:15:26,380 --> 00:15:27,620
What should I do now?

281
00:15:33,650 --> 00:15:34,380
Why is my heart

282
00:15:35,220 --> 00:15:36,660
aching?

283
00:15:37,540 --> 00:15:39,580
Is my heart disease worsening?

284
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:41,740
No.

285
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:55,460
Physician Yan.

286
00:15:55,980 --> 00:15:57,740
Help me. I can't take it anymore.

287
00:15:58,050 --> 00:15:59,020
Take a look.

288
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:00,940
Didn't you just bump your nose?

289
00:16:01,610 --> 00:16:02,650
It's no big deal.

290
00:16:02,940 --> 00:16:04,380
Why are you making a fuss?

291
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:05,940
Apply this for the night.

292
00:16:06,100 --> 00:16:06,900
It'll be fine tomorrow.

293
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:08,220
Not this.

294
00:16:08,420 --> 00:16:09,220
It's here.

295
00:16:09,980 --> 00:16:11,780
My heart disease is getting worse.

296
00:16:13,700 --> 00:16:14,500
What's going on?

297
00:16:14,700 --> 00:16:15,940
These days,

298
00:16:16,420 --> 00:16:17,460
sometimes,

299
00:16:17,620 --> 00:16:19,340
my heart pounds.

300
00:16:19,690 --> 00:16:21,660
Sometimes it aches.

301
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,500
Especially when Li Chengxi is angry at me,

302
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,340
this condition gets worse.

303
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,300
Please help me.

304
00:16:29,380 --> 00:16:30,380
I can't

305
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:31,860
heal your illness.

306
00:16:33,060 --> 00:16:33,860
What?

307
00:16:34,820 --> 00:16:36,420
You can't cure it?

308
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:41,900
Are you kidding me?

309
00:16:43,220 --> 00:16:44,380
You said

310
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,260
you can cure me with a strong medicine.

311
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,340
Yes.

312
00:16:48,380 --> 00:16:50,700
But this medicine is with Li Chengxi.

313
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:52,020
Only he can cure you.

314
00:16:53,220 --> 00:16:55,220
Li Chengxi can cure diseases?

315
00:16:57,660 --> 00:16:58,460
Someone

316
00:16:58,620 --> 00:17:00,380
is waiting for you to grow up.

317
00:17:00,890 --> 00:17:03,140
Goodness knows when that will happen.

318
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,099
Forget it.

319
00:17:04,619 --> 00:17:05,579
Since his brother

320
00:17:05,579 --> 00:17:07,579
is a good test subject,

321
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:08,740
I'll help him.

322
00:17:09,619 --> 00:17:11,460
Li Chengxi is the root of your problem.

323
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,099
What?

324
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:19,810
Could it be that

325
00:17:20,650 --> 00:17:22,060
Li Chengxi used

326
00:17:22,060 --> 00:17:23,260
some strange magic on me?

327
00:17:24,780 --> 00:17:25,900
Silly girl.

328
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,900
You're in love with Li Chengxi.

329
00:17:31,820 --> 00:17:32,420
You...

330
00:17:34,420 --> 00:17:35,770
What are you talking about?

331
00:17:36,020 --> 00:17:37,460
I can only fall in love with the Destined One.

332
00:17:37,460 --> 00:17:38,780
How could I like someone else?

333
00:17:38,820 --> 00:17:39,340
Wrong.

334
00:17:40,220 --> 00:17:41,900
You need the Destined One.

335
00:17:42,620 --> 00:17:43,820
But you like

336
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:45,500
Li Chengxi.

337
00:17:45,500 --> 00:17:46,980
I don't believe you.

338
00:17:47,180 --> 00:17:48,180
You old fox.

339
00:17:48,460 --> 00:17:49,500
You always want to fool me.

340
00:17:49,780 --> 00:17:51,580
I'm different from that fool Yun Gaixue.

341
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:52,860
You can't scare me.

342
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:17,260
Physician Yan is really good at talking nonsense.

343
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:20,700
How could I like Li Chengxi?

344
00:18:21,610 --> 00:18:22,860
It must be because

345
00:18:23,420 --> 00:18:25,380
he was mad at me and ignored me.

346
00:18:26,260 --> 00:18:28,580
If something goes wrong between good friends,

347
00:18:28,980 --> 00:18:31,340
they will be worried and sad.

348
00:18:32,580 --> 00:18:34,540
It's definitely not because of love.

349
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:42,410
No.

350
00:18:43,050 --> 00:18:45,340
I have to think of a way

351
00:18:45,540 --> 00:18:46,700
to apologize to him

352
00:18:46,780 --> 00:18:47,820
and show my sincerity.

353
00:18:48,820 --> 00:18:49,770
Maybe

354
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,820
when he calms down,

355
00:18:52,540 --> 00:18:54,100
my illness

356
00:18:54,610 --> 00:18:55,940
will be cured.

357
00:19:04,900 --> 00:19:06,220
If I want to apologize,

358
00:19:06,780 --> 00:19:08,780
I should at least buy a decent gift.

359
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:11,140
But

360
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:13,460
I've known Li Chengxi for so long and

361
00:19:13,940 --> 00:19:15,940
I don't even know what he likes.

362
00:19:17,910 --> 00:19:19,550
[Supreme Jade Shop]

363
00:19:23,380 --> 00:19:24,940
Everyone, please come and judge.

364
00:19:25,020 --> 00:19:25,660
This man

365
00:19:25,700 --> 00:19:27,580
stole my jade pendant in broad daylight.

366
00:19:27,940 --> 00:19:28,780
Stole?

367
00:19:29,380 --> 00:19:30,660
I just entered the store.

368
00:19:31,060 --> 00:19:32,100
I haven't even stepped near the counter.

369
00:19:32,420 --> 00:19:34,140
Madam, don't accuse a good person.

370
00:19:34,530 --> 00:19:35,300
A good person?

371
00:19:35,540 --> 00:19:36,850
Why are you wearing a mask in broad daylight?

372
00:19:36,850 --> 00:19:37,980
What kind of good person are you?

373
00:19:38,530 --> 00:19:39,660
If you don't return the jade now,

374
00:19:39,700 --> 00:19:40,820
you can't leave.

375
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:42,300
Guards, arrest him!

376
00:19:44,420 --> 00:19:45,050
Stop!

377
00:19:50,660 --> 00:19:51,900
-Why is it with him? -It's there.

378
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:52,460
He stole it.

379
00:19:52,460 --> 00:19:53,740
He was the one who stole it.

380
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:56,260
Is this your jade?

381
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:57,980
Thank you.

382
00:19:58,260 --> 00:19:59,740
You judged him by his appearance,

383
00:20:00,220 --> 00:20:01,900
and framed him for being a bad guy.

384
00:20:01,900 --> 00:20:03,060
Apologize to him now.

385
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:05,700
Since it's a misunderstanding,

386
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:07,620
you don't have to apologize.

387
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:10,340
You are really reasonable.

388
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:10,860
Here.

389
00:20:11,180 --> 00:20:11,730
Miss.

390
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:12,980
Thank you.

391
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,020
What are you looking at?

392
00:20:15,060 --> 00:20:15,860
Leave if you're not buying.

393
00:20:15,860 --> 00:20:16,700
Don't block the door.

394
00:20:21,020 --> 00:20:21,980
May I know your name?

395
00:20:22,460 --> 00:20:23,980
Thank you for your words.

396
00:20:24,380 --> 00:20:25,260
But I'm worried that

397
00:20:25,580 --> 00:20:27,090
the thief is a local gangster.

398
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,420
I'm afraid you'll be in trouble.

399
00:20:28,980 --> 00:20:30,220
As the Young Mistress of the Tang Sect,

400
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:31,660
I'm not afraid of trouble.

401
00:20:31,820 --> 00:20:32,860
If he dares to come again,

402
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,100
I can handle him.

403
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:35,220
I'll protect you.

404
00:20:49,260 --> 00:20:49,700
Well,

405
00:20:50,540 --> 00:20:52,020
how should I repay you

406
00:20:52,020 --> 00:20:53,220
for saving me?

407
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:55,050
What is this?

408
00:20:55,250 --> 00:20:57,420
I, Tang Buyan, love to help people.

409
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:02,610
You're a man.

410
00:21:03,010 --> 00:21:03,900
Tell me.

411
00:21:04,020 --> 00:21:05,660
What gifts do men like?

412
00:21:09,900 --> 00:21:10,740
Miss Tang,

413
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:11,900
who is the person

414
00:21:12,340 --> 00:21:13,260
to you?

415
00:21:13,420 --> 00:21:14,060
It's...

416
00:21:14,300 --> 00:21:14,820
You

417
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:17,020
have fallen in love with Li Chengxi.

418
00:21:18,340 --> 00:21:19,140
A brother.

419
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:21,420
He's definitely a friend.

420
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:23,380
He's a very, very close friend.

421
00:21:25,290 --> 00:21:27,660
I made him angry before.

422
00:21:27,860 --> 00:21:29,180
I want to buy him a gift,

423
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:31,220
but I don't know what to choose.

424
00:21:33,700 --> 00:21:36,060
This jade coronet looks good.

425
00:21:37,140 --> 00:21:37,820
Really?

426
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,010
Okay, that's it then.

427
00:21:48,220 --> 00:21:49,620
I was lucky to meet you today.

428
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:50,700
How about...

429
00:21:52,220 --> 00:21:53,380
It's already late.

430
00:21:53,940 --> 00:21:55,700
I have to go.

431
00:21:55,770 --> 00:21:56,980
Let's have dinner together sometime.

432
00:21:59,220 --> 00:21:59,700
Tang...

433
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:06,060
Will we

434
00:22:07,060 --> 00:22:08,100
meet again?

435
00:23:06,700 --> 00:23:07,300
Assistant manager.

436
00:23:09,380 --> 00:23:10,100
Assistant manager.

437
00:23:15,980 --> 00:23:16,820
Did you see him?

438
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,660
The guy who hit my acupoint.

439
00:23:21,020 --> 00:23:21,500
Me?

440
00:23:21,780 --> 00:23:22,380
Not you.

441
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:26,340
Someone broke in.

442
00:23:26,660 --> 00:23:27,500
Go and report to the manager.

443
00:23:27,700 --> 00:23:28,300
Okay.

444
00:23:31,300 --> 00:23:32,020
Manager, I have bad news.

445
00:23:32,250 --> 00:23:33,300
A thief broke in.

446
00:23:34,940 --> 00:23:35,500
This way.

447
00:23:35,620 --> 00:23:36,620
Okay, hurry up.

448
00:23:38,900 --> 00:23:39,380
Hurry.

449
00:23:42,700 --> 00:23:43,220
Keep up!

450
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:51,740
A thief broke in.

451
00:23:52,420 --> 00:23:53,490
Did something happen to my cousin?

452
00:23:53,980 --> 00:23:55,220
Everyone in Fengming Pavilion, be on guard

453
00:23:55,460 --> 00:23:56,220
and strengthen the search.

454
00:23:56,460 --> 00:23:57,100
Yes.

455
00:23:58,020 --> 00:23:58,700
The thief is there.

456
00:24:00,260 --> 00:24:00,820
You misunderstood.

457
00:24:00,900 --> 00:24:01,690
I'm not a thief.

458
00:24:02,180 --> 00:24:03,860
Why would a thief admit that he's a thief?

459
00:24:04,540 --> 00:24:05,050
Go after him!

460
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:16,940
Thief!

461
00:24:25,900 --> 00:24:26,940
He is so powerful.

462
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:28,780
He actually hit my mute acupoint from such a distance.

463
00:24:29,940 --> 00:24:30,700
I fumbled.

464
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:32,260
I was going to stab his Fengchi Acupoint

465
00:24:32,260 --> 00:24:33,220
so that he can't move.

466
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:35,940
Hurry! He's over there!

467
00:24:37,420 --> 00:24:37,900
Follow him!

468
00:24:38,180 --> 00:24:38,940
Hurry, catch up with him.

469
00:24:40,660 --> 00:24:41,380
Physician Yan.

470
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,900
I wonder if Li Chengxi will like it.

471
00:24:51,900 --> 00:24:53,660
But it took me a long time to choose it.

472
00:24:56,180 --> 00:24:57,610
I hope it'll make him less angry.

473
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:12,380
Li Chengxi.

474
00:25:17,060 --> 00:25:17,980
Li Chengxi.

475
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,380
Li Jian?

476
00:25:40,500 --> 00:25:41,420
Why are you here?

477
00:25:44,820 --> 00:25:45,860
What happened?

478
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:47,140
Why can't you speak?

479
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:50,340
I came to Fengming Pavilion to look for my cousin,

480
00:25:50,420 --> 00:25:51,620
but I was mistaken as a thief

481
00:25:51,740 --> 00:25:52,740
and was hit by on my mute acupoint.

482
00:25:52,940 --> 00:25:53,820
I can't explain.

483
00:25:53,940 --> 00:25:54,660
Li Jian,

484
00:25:55,140 --> 00:25:57,290
what are you signaling?

485
00:26:01,340 --> 00:26:03,140
What's on your neck?

486
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,380
Yan.

487
00:26:11,220 --> 00:26:11,940
Li Chengxi.

488
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:13,220
Why are you here?

489
00:26:18,260 --> 00:26:19,060
Who are you?

490
00:26:19,460 --> 00:26:20,780
How dare you break into Fengming Pavilion at night?

491
00:26:21,460 --> 00:26:22,900
Break into Fengming Pavilion at night?

492
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:24,140
What's going on?

493
00:27:03,220 --> 00:27:04,620
Why do you have a teardrop mole too?
