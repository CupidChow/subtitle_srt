00:00:57,420 --> 00:00:59,380
What kind of stupid token did Shen Yi give?

6
00:00:59,740 --> 00:01:00,660
She even bragged.

7
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:01,940
She said her aunt would treat us as honored guests

8
00:01:01,940 --> 00:01:03,340
when she saw this.

9
00:01:03,940 --> 00:01:04,660
What happened then?

10
00:01:04,980 --> 00:01:06,140
Not only did her aunt not see us,

11
00:01:06,180 --> 00:01:07,620
but also sent puppets to attack us.

12
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:08,289
Hush.

13
00:01:08,289 --> 00:01:08,980
Lower your voice.

14
00:01:09,380 --> 00:01:10,780
These puppets are very vigilant.

15
00:01:10,940 --> 00:01:12,180
They will find out if we are careless.

16
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:13,060
What are you afraid of?

17
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:14,940
I am worried that I have no one to kill.

18

If it weren't for you, the burden,

19
00:01:17,539 --> 00:01:19,450
I would have killed them all.

20
00:01:22,100 --> 00:01:23,100
I'm a burden?

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:25,420
Why don't you have a try?

22
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:01,660
You're still a burden.

23
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,420
Thank you for forgiving me

24

If you keep talking rubbish,

26
00:02:08,460 --> 00:02:09,660
I'll throw you into the puppet pile.

27
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:27,060
Again. Here.

28
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,620
Master, another two men and one woman broke into the valley.

29

It hasn't been so lively for years.

Yan.

35
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:11,290
This is the mung bean soup for you

36
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:12,540
to reduce internal heat.

37
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:13,580
Yan.

38
00:03:14,450 --> 00:03:15,900
This is your favorite, syrup of plum.

39
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:20,260
How do you know I love syrup of plum best?

41

Mr. Li, please behave yourself.

I'm Yan's fiance.

I'm afraid you shouldn't do something so intimate.

These puppets are so annoying.

00:06:08,340 --> 00:06:09,340
They won't die,

87
00:06:09,820 --> 00:06:10,940
and they keep pestering us.

88
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:22,780
I have an idea.

89
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:25,970
Tell me.

90

of different colours.

92
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:31,460
As long as we wear the same clothes as them,

93
00:06:31,500 --> 00:06:32,490
we'll be treated as the same kind,

94
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:33,580
and they won't attack us.

95
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:35,140
You're right.

96
00:06:37,580 --> 00:06:39,100
You did use your brain today.

97
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:41,980
Go to hell. I'm always clever.

98
00:06:51,340 --> 00:06:52,140
And this.

99
00:06:54,260 --> 00:06:56,180
No, I can't afford it.

100
00:06:56,940 --> 00:06:57,659
If you don't bring this,

101
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,980
you'll definitely be recognized.

102
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:00,220
Hurry up. Don't waste time.

103
00:07:00,850 --> 00:07:01,860
I...

104
00:07:09,460 --> 00:07:10,180
Give it a try.

105
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,260
I'm really smart.

106
00:07:28,410 --> 00:07:30,580
Yan, I'm familiar with this area.

107
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:31,860
Why don't I explore the way first?

108
00:07:32,140 --> 00:07:33,340
And I'll tell you how to go later.

109
00:07:34,340 --> 00:07:36,100
Okay. Thank you.

110
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:37,500
You're welcome.

111
00:07:38,140 --> 00:07:39,380
This is what I should do.

112
00:07:51,820 --> 00:07:52,620
Li Chengxi,

113
00:07:53,409 --> 00:07:55,060
you've been against me several times.

114
00:07:55,340 --> 00:07:56,340
And you even want to take Yan away?

115
00:07:58,220 --> 00:07:59,020
Dream on.

116
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,700
Yan, I just saw

117
00:08:06,700 --> 00:08:08,140
the Wushan symbol there.

118
00:08:08,620 --> 00:08:09,410
The direction

119
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:11,060
points to the cave not far from here.

120
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:11,740
Really?

121
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:12,700
Let's go.

122
00:08:13,020 --> 00:08:13,810
Let's go to the cave.

123
00:08:13,940 --> 00:08:14,340
Okay.

124
00:08:16,660 --> 00:08:17,300
Yan.

125
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:31,140
There's candlelight inside.

126
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:33,370
Physician Yan and Yun Gaixue could be inside.

127
00:08:44,700 --> 00:08:45,980
So, they're locals.

128
00:08:46,060 --> 00:08:48,020
I thought they were some high-class puppets.

129
00:08:49,420 --> 00:08:50,940
They can't be caught here

130
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,020
to do labor, right?

131
00:08:55,900 --> 00:08:56,220
How could it happen!

132
00:08:56,220 --> 00:08:56,700
Be careful.

133
00:09:13,940 --> 00:09:15,340
How can they attack people?

134
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:17,420
This kind of puppet is very aggressive.

135
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:18,940
I'm afraid my flute

136
00:09:19,340 --> 00:09:20,540
can't control them at all.

137
00:09:21,060 --> 00:09:22,100
Let's save him now.

138
00:09:23,060 --> 00:09:25,090
Yan, it's dangerous in the cave.

139
00:09:25,140 --> 00:09:26,380
I'm afraid you'll be in danger if you go in.

140
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:28,500
Let me do it.

141
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:34,130
Oh no.

142
00:09:45,580 --> 00:09:47,500
Wait here. I'll save him.

143
00:09:48,380 --> 00:09:49,890
Yan! Yan!

144
00:09:50,300 --> 00:09:52,020
Yan! Yan!

145
00:10:17,460 --> 00:10:18,260
Li Chengxi.

146
00:10:19,860 --> 00:10:20,370
Be careful.

147
00:10:37,900 --> 00:10:38,700
Sorry.

148
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:39,340
It's okay.

149
00:10:39,500 --> 00:10:40,260
Leave it to me.

150
00:11:10,060 --> 00:11:10,820
Li Chengxi.

151
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:11,820
Look!

152
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:13,060
The spring is their life-gate.

153
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,660
Screw you!

154
00:11:57,090 --> 00:11:58,740
Yan, are you okay?

155
00:11:59,500 --> 00:12:00,060
I'm fine.

156
00:12:00,380 --> 00:12:01,020
I didn't expect

157
00:12:02,300 --> 00:12:03,820
you came back to save me.

158
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:08,700
I'm just being righteous.

159
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:10,100
The situation is critical.

160
00:12:10,100 --> 00:12:12,300
Whoever is here, I will come in and save him.

161
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,820
We'd better find the exit of the cave

162
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:18,460
and meet Li Jian quickly.

163
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:21,860
Did you hurt your hand?

164
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:25,460
It's nothing.

165
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:29,820
Yan.

166
00:12:31,300 --> 00:12:33,020
Don't get hurt again to save me.

167
00:12:33,900 --> 00:12:35,860
Every time I wish I was the one who got hurt.

168
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,490
Every time?

169
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,300
I got hurt for you before?

170
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:46,900
How about this?

171
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:48,260
Tell me

172
00:12:48,300 --> 00:12:50,060
what happened between us before.

173
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:54,940
I remember

174
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,260
the first time we met

175
00:12:57,900 --> 00:12:58,820
was in Shu.

176
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:00,740
At that time,

177
00:13:01,420 --> 00:13:02,250
Xue and I...

178
00:13:02,860 --> 00:13:03,780
Both of us

179
00:13:04,620 --> 00:13:05,460
were robbed by you

180
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:07,820
on the way.

181
00:13:34,660 --> 00:13:35,580
I've said so much.

182
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,660
I don't know if you remember anything.

183
00:13:39,980 --> 00:13:40,780
Yan.

184
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:42,260
Yan.

185
00:13:45,540 --> 00:13:46,220
Great!

186
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,660
Wonderful!

187
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:51,540
I think your story is very, very good.

188
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:54,100
I'm particularly willing to trust you.

189
00:13:54,260 --> 00:13:55,260
But I...

190
00:13:56,580 --> 00:13:57,980
I really

191
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,100
can't remember anything.

192
00:14:00,220 --> 00:14:00,700
It's okay.

193
00:14:01,300 --> 00:14:02,140
Don't force yourself.

194
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:03,980
Now,

195
00:14:04,460 --> 00:14:06,340
we should find the mechanism to get out first.

196
00:14:18,340 --> 00:14:19,980
Where is it?

197
00:14:31,460 --> 00:14:33,260
It must be with the statue.

198
00:14:53,980 --> 00:14:55,500
There is no such thing here.

199
00:15:13,650 --> 00:15:14,260
Yan.

200
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:15,620
I found it.

201
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:17,220
Really?

202
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,060
Where?

203
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:19,460
It's...

204
00:15:24,820 --> 00:15:25,660
Yan.

205
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:27,220
You...

206
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:28,540
Are you okay?

207
00:15:30,340 --> 00:15:31,220
Are you

208
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:32,980
uncomfortable?

209
00:15:33,460 --> 00:15:34,420
I'm fine.

210
00:15:34,620 --> 00:15:35,820
And I don't feel any discomfort.

211
00:15:35,940 --> 00:15:36,620
What's wrong?

212
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:39,100
Nothing.

213
00:15:39,580 --> 00:15:40,820
Since the symptom of the black face

214
00:15:41,020 --> 00:15:42,340
has no other influence for the time being,

215
00:15:43,140 --> 00:15:44,180
to prevent her from being frightened,

216
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:45,820
I should hide it from her for now.

217
00:15:46,460 --> 00:15:47,420
It won't be too late to tell her

218
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,180
when we find Brother Yan

219
00:15:49,700 --> 00:15:50,980
and let him make a diagnosis and give treatment.

220
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:08,100
Where is Li Jian?

221
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:09,940
Wasn't he outside the stone gate just now?

222
00:16:10,460 --> 00:16:11,340
Why is he gone?

223
00:16:11,980 --> 00:16:13,060
Did something happen?

224
00:16:13,620 --> 00:16:14,900
After all, he's the son of the Lord of the Valley.

225
00:16:15,380 --> 00:16:16,660
He should be fine.

226
00:16:17,740 --> 00:16:18,410
How about

227
00:16:18,860 --> 00:16:19,860
we go to find Brother Yan first,

228
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,620
and then meet up with Li Jian.

229
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:55,940
I'm thirsty. I'll get some water from the river.

230
00:16:56,180 --> 00:16:56,940
River?

231
00:17:00,700 --> 00:17:01,540
Let me do it.

232
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:03,100
Stay here.

233
00:17:27,369 --> 00:17:27,900
You...

234
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:44,660
What are you doing?

235
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:47,020
I didn't mean it.

236
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:47,660
You are...

237
00:17:47,970 --> 00:17:48,810
You have water on you.

238
00:17:52,780 --> 00:17:53,650
Go away!

239
00:17:54,100 --> 00:17:54,940
Rascal!

240
00:17:55,420 --> 00:17:56,060
Yan.

241
00:17:56,620 --> 00:17:57,700
I didn't mean it.

242
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:01,060
What are you going to do?

243
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:01,980
Let me help you.

244
00:18:02,340 --> 00:18:03,660
I need to relieve myself.

245
00:18:03,660 --> 00:18:04,740
Are you going to help me too?

246
00:18:04,820 --> 00:18:05,380
Get out of the way.

247
00:18:15,490 --> 00:18:16,620
Where are these puppets

248
00:18:16,770 --> 00:18:18,060
in the middle of the night?

249
00:18:18,380 --> 00:18:19,260
Who knows?

250
00:18:19,780 --> 00:18:21,060
And we're out of wine.

251
00:18:24,530 --> 00:18:25,540
I'll take a leak.

252
00:18:25,620 --> 00:18:26,740
You can rest here.

253
00:18:27,740 --> 00:18:28,860
Don't make too much noise.

254
00:18:28,940 --> 00:18:30,860
You'll suffer if you mess with those puppets.

255
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:33,540
I'm not afraid of those puppets.

256
00:18:33,780 --> 00:18:34,540
You

257
00:18:34,900 --> 00:18:36,460
mind your own business.

258
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,140
Li Chengxi

259
00:18:43,500 --> 00:18:45,500
gets fresh with me when Li Jian is not around.

260
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:47,300
He is dressed like a gentleman,

261
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,700
but he's actually a hooligan.

262
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:51,700
He wastes such a good-looking face.

263
00:18:52,060 --> 00:18:54,060
Toilet. Toilet.

264
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:00,380
Little black ghost.

265
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:01,380
Puppets.

266
00:19:05,530 --> 00:19:07,060
The little black ghost is quite interesting.

267
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:12,900
Forget it. I'd better go to the toilet first.

268
00:19:19,500 --> 00:19:22,260
Why is Serene Valley full of puppets?

269
00:19:22,940 --> 00:19:24,460
Luckily, I ran fast.

270
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:27,300
Otherwise, I would've been taken to make mud.

271
00:19:29,700 --> 00:19:30,500
But

272
00:19:31,100 --> 00:19:32,140
he just said

273
00:19:33,090 --> 00:19:35,460
little black ghost?

274
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:39,100
Huh?

275
00:19:44,620 --> 00:19:45,540
Little black ghost.

276
00:19:45,820 --> 00:19:46,530
Little black ghost.

277
00:19:46,900 --> 00:19:47,540
Little black ghost.

278
00:19:48,060 --> 00:19:48,860
Li Chengxi.

279
00:19:49,380 --> 00:19:50,260
There's a little black ghost.

280
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:51,740
There's a little black ghost in the water.

281
00:19:54,730 --> 00:19:55,370
It's okay.

282
00:19:56,300 --> 00:19:57,140
She has left.

283
00:20:24,900 --> 00:20:26,020
Li Chengxi.

284
00:20:26,140 --> 00:20:27,300
What are you doing?

285
00:20:30,380 --> 00:20:31,180
Nothing.

286
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:33,780
The little black ghost you mentioned

287
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:35,820
might be a new puppet.

288
00:20:36,420 --> 00:20:37,300
Don't look back.

289
00:20:37,980 --> 00:20:39,060
Don't attract her again.

290
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:47,420
Crazy bastard.

291
00:20:49,500 --> 00:20:50,220
Crazy bastard.

292
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:51,700
What's wrong?

293
00:20:53,340 --> 00:20:54,540
I saw a puppet just now.

294
00:20:54,860 --> 00:20:55,940
She was all black.

295
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,300
Even her face was black.

296
00:20:57,420 --> 00:20:59,050
Only her teeth and eyes were floating there.

297
00:20:59,050 --> 00:20:59,900
It's so fun!

298
00:21:01,500 --> 00:21:02,380
No way.

299
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:05,460
This puppet is obviously made with human form.

300
00:21:05,570 --> 00:21:06,580
Why is it black?

301
00:21:07,020 --> 00:21:08,020
How would I know?

302
00:21:08,140 --> 00:21:10,180
Maybe it's because

303
00:21:10,300 --> 00:21:12,260
the night is so black that I can't see anything.

304
00:21:17,500 --> 00:21:18,460
I have an idea.

305
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:19,980
In that case,

306
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,460
why don't we pretend to be this black puppet?

307
00:21:23,180 --> 00:21:23,940
In this way,

308
00:21:23,980 --> 00:21:25,820
other puppets won't find us.

309
00:21:25,900 --> 00:21:27,380
That's right. Why didn't I think of that?

310
00:21:27,380 --> 00:21:28,490
Yes.

311
00:21:31,180 --> 00:21:31,580
Let's go.

312
00:21:32,020 --> 00:21:32,420
Let's go.

313
00:21:41,620 --> 00:21:42,860
Done.

314
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:44,780
How did it go?

315
00:21:46,460 --> 00:21:47,460
Perfect.

316
00:21:48,980 --> 00:21:50,300
Look at you now.

317
00:21:50,620 --> 00:21:52,460
Even if your brother is standing in front of you,

318
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,660
he can't recognize you at all.

319
00:21:55,060 --> 00:21:55,860
I'll draw it for you too.

320
00:21:56,050 --> 00:21:56,580
No need.

321
00:21:57,620 --> 00:21:58,980
I'm fine now.

322
00:21:59,410 --> 00:22:01,460
I'm so kind to help you this time,

323
00:22:01,620 --> 00:22:02,740
and you don't appreciate it?

324
00:22:03,500 --> 00:22:04,780
What a pity.

325
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:07,940
You missed a chance

326
00:22:07,940 --> 00:22:09,740
to become the strongest puppet in Serene Valley

327
00:22:14,940 --> 00:22:15,620
It doesn't matter.

328
00:22:16,460 --> 00:22:18,940
You're the strongest puppet.

329
00:22:19,460 --> 00:22:20,340
That is enough.

330
00:22:24,700 --> 00:22:26,020
You bastard!

331
00:22:26,220 --> 00:22:28,700
I've been strict with you since you were little.

332
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,620
How dare you have evil intentions?

333
00:22:30,980 --> 00:22:33,890
You use dirty tricks as soon as you get into the valley.

334
00:22:34,700 --> 00:22:36,460
And you want to hurt the girl?

335
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:37,660
Bah!

336
00:22:38,090 --> 00:22:39,980
You're just like your damn father.

337
00:22:43,460 --> 00:22:44,340
Where's your mask?

338
00:22:45,300 --> 00:22:46,740
Did I ask you to take it off?

339
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:47,860
Where's the mask?

340
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:50,780
I've grown up.

341
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:54,260
Do you want me to wear a mask forever?

342
00:22:54,580 --> 00:22:55,730
So what?

343
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,420
Did I ask you to take it off?

344
00:22:58,980 --> 00:23:00,940
Your face makes me sick.

345
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:01,820
How dare you take it off!

346
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:03,060
How dare you take it off!

347
00:23:03,500 --> 00:23:05,620
How dare you take it off!

348
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:10,420
You stay right here to reflect on yourself.

349
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,780
I'm so mad.

350
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:35,820
What are you doing now?

351
00:23:36,260 --> 00:23:37,100
I thought about it.

352
00:23:37,420 --> 00:23:39,340
The black puppet is too dark.

353
00:23:39,660 --> 00:23:40,820
If she attacks us,

354
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,220
we can't see her or fight back.

355
00:23:43,050 --> 00:23:44,620
It's better to make a trap.

356
00:23:45,100 --> 00:23:47,220
Maybe we can catch one to play with.

357
00:23:48,730 --> 00:23:49,540
You are so childish.

358
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:19,380
This is the little black ghost

359
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:20,580
I saw by the river.

360
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:25,700
Yan.

361
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:36,780
Watch out!

362
00:24:46,820 --> 00:24:47,580
Li Chengxi.

363
00:24:47,740 --> 00:24:48,220
You...

364
00:24:48,340 --> 00:24:49,180
Are you okay?

365
00:24:49,340 --> 00:24:50,140
Are you okay?

366
00:24:50,940 --> 00:24:52,660
Why did you block it for me?

367
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,980
What if the secret weapon is poisonous?

368
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:56,850
I'm glad you're fine.

369
00:24:59,700 --> 00:25:00,460
Li Chengxi.

370
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,380
Li Chengxi.

371
00:25:02,730 --> 00:25:03,500
Li Chengxi.

372
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:08,060
This is...
