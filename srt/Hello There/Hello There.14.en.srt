You're so handsome.

103
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:43,700
Why do you wear a mask to hide your face?

104
00:06:44,060 --> 00:06:45,060
Don't wear it anymore.

105
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,460
I don't know what you've been through,

106

108

No one will dare to mess with you anymore.

109
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:03,930
Here, drink the decoction.

110
00:07:09,180 --> 00:07:10,020

Don't you think you should repay me?

114
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:16,300
I

115
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:18,700
don't need any treasures.

116
00:07:18,980 --> 00:07:20,100
I just want you

117
00:07:20,620 --> 00:07:21,940
to go back to the Tang Sect with me.

118
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,580
Let's get to know each other first.

119
00:07:23,820 --> 00:07:25,780
Other things can wait.

120
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,500
Have you

121
00:07:30,060 --> 00:07:31,780
forgotten what happened before?

122
00:07:31,980 --> 00:07:32,980
No.

123
00:07:33,260 --> 00:07:34,380
I was

124
00:07:34,780 --> 00:07:36,500
chasing a man with a mole below his eye.

125
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:38,860
He ran so fast.

126
00:07:39,420 --> 00:07:41,460
I somehow fell asleep later.

127
00:07:41,700 --> 00:07:42,610
When I woke up,

128
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:44,260
that man I'd been chasing became you.

129
00:07:45,260 --> 00:07:46,940
Those two men with us were so strange.

130
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:47,980
They attacked us for no reason.

131
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:49,580
But don't worry.

132
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:51,060
After I return to the Tang Sect,

133
00:07:51,140 --> 00:07:52,980
I'll send someone to wipe them out.

134
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:54,810
Do you remember

135
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:56,420
who I am?

136
00:07:57,330 --> 00:07:59,180
You are my Destined One.

137
00:08:00,300 --> 00:08:00,780
By the way,

138
00:08:01,220 --> 00:08:03,410
I don't know your name yet.

139
00:08:10,740 --> 00:08:11,180
Yan.

140
00:08:12,700 --> 00:08:13,420
You...

141
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:15,100
You've lost your memory.

142
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,380
That's what happened.

143
00:08:41,890 --> 00:08:42,700
Now you know.

144
00:08:50,660 --> 00:08:53,380
I've forgotten so many things?

145
00:08:54,980 --> 00:08:55,530
Li Jian,

146
00:08:56,180 --> 00:08:57,100
you mean

147
00:08:57,580 --> 00:08:58,380
I've promised

148
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:00,500
to marry you?

149
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:06,020
Then after I get better,

150
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:07,260
let's go back to the Tang Sect and get married.

151
00:09:09,860 --> 00:09:11,380
But the Tang Sect is far away.

152
00:09:11,860 --> 00:09:13,220
Traveling far soon after you get better

153
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:14,860
is not good for your recovery.

154
00:09:15,860 --> 00:09:17,020
If you don't mind,

155
00:09:17,900 --> 00:09:19,220
why don't we get married here?

156
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:21,060
Here?

157
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:24,180
Don't you think it's too shabby here?

158
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,900
It was not easy for me to find the Destined One.

159
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:31,220
I must not let him leave.

160
00:09:31,740 --> 00:09:32,420
How about this?

161
00:09:32,620 --> 00:09:34,060
Don't you have a cousin

162
00:09:34,060 --> 00:09:35,220
who owns Fengming Pavilion?

163
00:09:35,500 --> 00:09:37,060
We'll get married at Fengming Pavilion.

164
00:09:37,860 --> 00:09:39,250
I'll send a letter to my senior sister now

165
00:09:39,380 --> 00:09:40,620
and ask them to celebrate with us.

166
00:09:44,340 --> 00:09:45,020
Okay.

167
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:52,020
Brother,

168
00:09:52,780 --> 00:09:54,220
don't be too sad.

169
00:09:56,820 --> 00:09:59,540
Although Tang Buyan kept competing with me for your attention,

170
00:09:59,940 --> 00:10:01,530
I'm also sad that she's gone.

171
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:02,940
Everyone in Fengming Pavilion

172
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:04,380
is looking for Tang Buyan and my cousin.

173
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:05,700
Take a rest.

174
00:10:06,420 --> 00:10:07,620
We haven't found them yet,

175
00:10:07,660 --> 00:10:08,860
you can't collapse.

176
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:10,460
Yeah, brother.

177
00:10:11,260 --> 00:10:13,020
Will you feel better

178
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:14,420
if you tie me up?

179
00:10:14,500 --> 00:10:15,420
I won't fight back.

180
00:10:15,980 --> 00:10:17,620
I just interrogated Black Wind's Double Tyrants.

181
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:20,140
I tried some brutal ways to elicit the truth.

182
00:10:20,650 --> 00:10:21,340
But

183
00:10:22,260 --> 00:10:23,500
they insisted

184
00:10:23,660 --> 00:10:25,460
that Miss Tang had passed out when they saw her.

185
00:10:26,460 --> 00:10:27,260
Li,

186
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:28,740
pull yourself together.

187
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:31,140
Miss Tang is waiting for you to avenge her.

188
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:32,100
No!

189
00:10:33,620 --> 00:10:34,900
Yan will be fine.

190
00:10:35,220 --> 00:10:36,220
She must be fine.

191
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:36,900
Okay.

192
00:10:36,900 --> 00:10:38,820
We all hope so,

193
00:10:38,860 --> 00:10:40,500
but so many days have passed.

194
00:10:40,820 --> 00:10:42,420
The hope is slim.

195
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:44,220
Li,

196
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:46,300
don't forget that you still have Xue.

197
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:47,860
You have to find

198
00:10:48,700 --> 00:10:49,660
the one who can read

199
00:10:49,660 --> 00:10:50,730
ancient scripts for him.

200
00:10:51,770 --> 00:10:52,580
Moreover,

201
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,780
if Miss Tang is still alive,

202
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:56,860
she will need the Book of Yueque too.

203
00:10:59,770 --> 00:11:00,660
Actually,

204
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:03,820
I can read ancient scripts.

205
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:08,370
It's a family skill.

206
00:11:08,500 --> 00:11:09,900
Everyone in my family needs to learn it.

207
00:11:27,620 --> 00:11:29,340
This ancient script

208
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:30,940
isn't about martial arts.

209
00:11:32,940 --> 00:11:35,100
It's about where to find the second volume of the Book of Yueque.

210
00:11:37,370 --> 00:11:38,740
It says

211
00:11:39,980 --> 00:11:41,660
the second volume

212
00:11:43,380 --> 00:11:44,460
is hidden in Serene Valley.

213
00:11:46,850 --> 00:11:48,580
Brother, what are we waiting for?

214
00:11:48,730 --> 00:11:50,140
Let's go to Serene Valley to find the Book of Yueque.

215
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:51,140
No.

216
00:11:53,580 --> 00:11:54,420
I can't go.

217
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:56,460
I have to stay to look for her.

218
00:11:57,460 --> 00:11:58,410
I won't give up

219
00:12:00,090 --> 00:12:01,340
until I find her.

220
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:03,860
Brother Yan,

221
00:12:05,060 --> 00:12:06,180
please take Xue

222
00:12:06,260 --> 00:12:07,540
to Serene Valley to find the Book of Yueque.

223
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,380
Brother,

224
00:12:08,700 --> 00:12:09,780
I'm not going without you.

225
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,060
I'll stay here with you.

226
00:12:11,420 --> 00:12:11,900
Xue,

227
00:12:13,220 --> 00:12:13,940
be a good boy.

228
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,020
Serene Valley is my ancestral land.

229
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,820
My aunt lives there.

230
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:22,970
[Fengming]

231
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,940
Take this with you.

232
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:24,940
You will be treated as distinguished guests.

233
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:27,820
I have to stay to look for my cousin,

234
00:12:28,100 --> 00:12:29,460
so I won't go with you.

235
00:12:35,780 --> 00:12:38,050
[A few days later]

236
00:12:38,660 --> 00:12:39,900
Senior sister will be very glad

237
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:40,700
to know that I've found

238
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:41,700
the Destined One.

239
00:12:42,020 --> 00:12:42,970
It's been days.

240
00:12:43,340 --> 00:12:44,220
Guess she'll soon be here.

241
00:12:44,340 --> 00:12:46,420
She can make it to attend our wedding.

242
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:50,260
Watermelon!

243
00:12:50,500 --> 00:12:50,940
Let's go.

244
00:12:51,220 --> 00:12:52,340
I'll buy you a watermelon.

245
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:14,260
Yan.

246
00:13:18,820 --> 00:13:19,330
Sorry.

247
00:13:19,940 --> 00:13:20,740
I mistook you for someone else.

248
00:13:21,140 --> 00:13:22,420
You didn't.

249
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:28,900
You can't  just walk away after you molested me.

250
00:13:29,300 --> 00:13:30,540
I won't let you go.

251
00:13:30,620 --> 00:13:31,420
Don't go.

252
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:37,380
Ladies and gentlemen,

253
00:13:37,410 --> 00:13:39,180
please help me.

254
00:13:40,380 --> 00:13:42,650
This man just groped me

255
00:13:43,260 --> 00:13:45,020
and thought he could just walk away.

256
00:13:45,020 --> 00:13:45,940
Excuse me.

257
00:13:46,850 --> 00:13:48,460
He pushed me to the ground

258
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,940
and wanted to leave.

259
00:13:52,300 --> 00:13:54,780
I'm still a maiden.

260
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:56,940
How could you do this to me?

261
00:13:56,940 --> 00:13:59,060
He looks like a decent man,

262
00:13:59,340 --> 00:14:01,260
but he molested a woman on the street.

263
00:14:01,460 --> 00:14:02,100
Yeah.

264
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:03,370
-That's impossible. -He's a beast.

265
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:05,060
Obviously, he was set up.

266
00:14:06,410 --> 00:14:07,860
He looks so genteel.

267
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:09,380
He doesn't look like someone who would molest women.

268
00:14:26,660 --> 00:14:27,420
Another victim!

269
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:27,940
Let go of me!

270
00:14:28,100 --> 00:14:28,890
The last victim is still on the ground.

271
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:29,660
Let go.

272
00:14:32,060 --> 00:14:33,820
I shouldn't have defended you.

273
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,500
So you're indeed a rogue.

274
00:14:36,100 --> 00:14:36,740
Yeah.

275
00:14:36,860 --> 00:14:38,620
We didn't wrong him.

276
00:14:38,860 --> 00:14:39,340
He is a rogue.

277
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:40,380
Yan,

278
00:14:41,900 --> 00:14:42,660
what's wrong with you?

279
00:14:45,020 --> 00:14:45,540
I...

280
00:15:02,700 --> 00:15:03,620
You lost your memory?

281
00:15:03,860 --> 00:15:04,620
What did the doctor say?

282
00:15:05,140 --> 00:15:05,890
Is it bad?

283
00:15:06,420 --> 00:15:08,140
We visited all the famous doctors nearby.

284
00:15:08,180 --> 00:15:09,460
They all said that she's in the clear

285
00:15:09,940 --> 00:15:11,220
and just needs time to recover fully.

286
00:15:15,300 --> 00:15:15,900
Yan,

287
00:15:16,610 --> 00:15:17,580
I'll take you to Physician Yan.

288
00:15:17,900 --> 00:15:18,900
He can definitely cure you.

289
00:15:19,580 --> 00:15:20,060
Wait.

290
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:21,700
Who are you?

291
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:23,700
You can't take me wherever you want, you lunatic.

292
00:15:26,900 --> 00:15:27,580
Yan,

293
00:15:28,180 --> 00:15:29,460
Mr. Li is caring about you.

294
00:15:29,650 --> 00:15:30,660
Don't blame him.

295
00:15:31,180 --> 00:15:32,060
It's getting late.

296
00:15:32,460 --> 00:15:33,700
Let me walk you to your room.

297
00:15:36,460 --> 00:15:37,260
Take your hands off her.

298
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,860
What are you doing?

299
00:15:39,180 --> 00:15:40,740
How dare you touch my Destined One?

300
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:41,700
Behave yourself or I'll cripple you!

301
00:15:42,780 --> 00:15:43,730
The Destined One?

302
00:15:44,660 --> 00:15:45,180
Yan,

303
00:15:45,610 --> 00:15:46,380
he's lying to you.

304
00:15:46,580 --> 00:15:47,490
He's not…

305
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:48,260
Enough.

306
00:15:48,770 --> 00:15:50,820
I don't know what you have got against me,

307
00:15:51,220 --> 00:15:52,580
but here's my advice.

308
00:15:52,740 --> 00:15:54,180
Don't cross a line.

309
00:15:54,580 --> 00:15:56,420
You don't want me to punch you.

310
00:16:02,780 --> 00:16:03,300
By the way,

311
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:04,780
I almost forgot to tell you this.

312
00:16:05,420 --> 00:16:07,420
Yan and I will get married in three days.

313
00:16:07,890 --> 00:16:09,620
I believe you know what to do

314
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:12,020
in Yan's best interest.

315
00:16:18,580 --> 00:16:19,620
Dear Li.

316
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:21,220
If you approach her now,

317
00:16:21,380 --> 00:16:22,580
she'll only resist you more.

318
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:24,930
Let me talk to her.

319
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:27,850
Girls understand each other better.

320
00:16:34,220 --> 00:16:35,460
Boss! Boss!

321
00:16:36,020 --> 00:16:37,060
Boss!

322
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:38,860
Zhuang, Ba, you finally showed up.

323
00:16:39,540 --> 00:16:39,980
Have a seat.

324
00:16:45,100 --> 00:16:45,900
Where is my senior sister?

325
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:52,250
She…

326
00:16:52,940 --> 00:16:54,500
She's busy with the affairs in the sect.

327
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:56,060
She can't make time to see you.

328
00:16:56,980 --> 00:16:58,300
She said

329
00:16:58,740 --> 00:17:00,420
you can go back to see her with your husband

330
00:17:00,420 --> 00:17:01,540
after you get married.

331
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,780
I see.

332
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:04,980
Fine.

333
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,050
We're here with you.

334
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:10,530
Don't worry, boss.

335
00:17:13,579 --> 00:17:14,220
You must be tired.

336
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:15,140
Here.

337
00:17:16,819 --> 00:17:17,540
Have some water.

338
00:17:21,020 --> 00:17:21,579
By the way,

339
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,460
you all know Li Chengxi, right?

340
00:17:25,540 --> 00:17:27,540
What happened between him and me?

341
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:28,740
Li Chengxi...

342
00:17:31,020 --> 00:17:31,700
Boss,

343
00:17:32,300 --> 00:17:34,220
it's a long story.

344
00:17:35,740 --> 00:17:36,580
Back then,

345
00:17:37,300 --> 00:17:39,380
Zhuang and I searched every place with you

346
00:17:39,380 --> 00:17:40,860
for the Destined One.

347
00:17:41,180 --> 00:17:43,100
We ran into Li Chengxi

348
00:17:43,100 --> 00:17:45,180
and he has a tear mole below his eye.

349
00:17:45,620 --> 00:17:46,540
We planned to give him the blood test.

350
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,340
But...

351
00:17:48,500 --> 00:17:51,020
I couldn't beat him and was tricked by him.

352
00:17:51,220 --> 00:17:52,660
How was that possible?

353
00:17:52,980 --> 00:17:53,580
It was a mistake.

354
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:55,340
A mistake.

355
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,820
Li Chengxi heard that the Tang Sect was recruiting guards,

356
00:17:58,900 --> 00:18:01,020
so he came with his younger brother Yun Gaixue.

357
00:18:02,060 --> 00:18:03,220
He has a younger brother?

358
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:03,940
Yes.

359
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:06,300
The two of them are very cunning.

360
00:18:06,380 --> 00:18:08,130
They used the names Li Han and Li Yan

361
00:18:09,060 --> 00:18:10,140
to hide their identities

362
00:18:10,620 --> 00:18:11,620
and got in the Tang Sect.

363
00:18:11,940 --> 00:18:13,060
Their goal was to steal

364
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:14,660
the Book of Yueque.

365
00:18:19,100 --> 00:18:20,660
The Book of Yueque.

366
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:22,260
What is it?

367
00:18:22,820 --> 00:18:23,980
It's…

368
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:24,900
It's a secret book

369
00:18:25,100 --> 00:18:27,660
passed down from generation to generation.

370
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,580
Did we give them the blood test?

371
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:33,740
Of course.

372
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,180
Both of them took the test.

373
00:18:35,500 --> 00:18:36,460
However,

374
00:18:36,580 --> 00:18:38,220
neither of them is the Destined One.

375
00:18:39,620 --> 00:18:40,340
What happened next?

376
00:18:40,700 --> 00:18:41,420
Later,

377
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,220
they took the Book of Yueque and went to Xuanqi Mountain.

378
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:47,300
Then you buried…

379
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:55,740
Then you finished

380
00:18:56,180 --> 00:18:58,300
the tasks our senior sister left you,

381
00:18:58,900 --> 00:19:00,580
and went to Fengming Pavilion

382
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:02,140
to find someone with a tear mole.

383
00:19:04,020 --> 00:19:05,140
Since that's the case,

384
00:19:05,540 --> 00:19:07,660
it seems that Li Chengxi is not a good guy.

385
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:10,860
Then why does he keep pestering me?

386
00:19:11,540 --> 00:19:12,180
Boss,

387
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:15,380
I'll be honest with you now.

388
00:19:15,500 --> 00:19:16,460
Li Chengxi

389
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:18,980
has always been carrying a torch for you.

390
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:20,500
To get rid of him,

391
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:21,820
you gave them the Book of Yueque

392
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:23,020
and asked them to leave.

393
00:19:24,100 --> 00:19:27,100
As for how you ran into him again,

394
00:19:28,380 --> 00:19:29,180
we don't know.

395
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:35,380
It made sense now!

396
00:19:36,410 --> 00:19:38,090
Li Chengxi must have

397
00:19:38,090 --> 00:19:39,420
fallen in love with me

398
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,020
after the blood test.

399
00:19:42,340 --> 00:19:44,500
Of course he would.

400
00:19:44,700 --> 00:19:46,380
I'm so smart and powerful after all.

401
00:19:46,660 --> 00:19:47,820
After knowing that I was coming to

402
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:49,500
Fengming Pavilion to buy someone with a tear mole,

403
00:19:49,580 --> 00:19:50,780
he stalked me

404
00:19:50,780 --> 00:19:51,980
and followed me here.

405
00:19:54,220 --> 00:19:55,900
I'm not surprised at all

406
00:19:56,370 --> 00:20:00,770
that he's fallen for so attractive a woman like me.

407
00:20:08,940 --> 00:20:09,740
Mr. Li,

408
00:20:11,820 --> 00:20:13,500
we've told her what you wanted us to say.

409
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:14,860
Maybe her memory loss

410
00:20:15,100 --> 00:20:17,340
is the grace of God after she suffered so much.

411
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:18,540
You're right.

412
00:20:18,980 --> 00:20:20,300
Forgetting the painful past

413
00:20:20,780 --> 00:20:21,980
is a better choice.

414
00:20:27,420 --> 00:20:28,220
Rest assured.

415
00:20:28,460 --> 00:20:29,770
I'll protect Yan

416
00:20:30,340 --> 00:20:31,380
with my life.

417
00:20:32,220 --> 00:20:33,820
I won't let anything happen to her.

418
00:20:34,580 --> 00:20:36,580
The long journey must have tired you.

419
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:38,180
I've prepared rooms for you.

420
00:20:38,410 --> 00:20:39,220
Go get some rest.

421
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:45,770
They're both surnamed Li,

422
00:20:46,420 --> 00:20:47,420
but they're so different from each other.

423
00:20:48,460 --> 00:20:49,780
Our boss has gone through so much.

424
00:20:50,100 --> 00:20:51,500
She deserves such a good man.

425
00:21:05,420 --> 00:21:07,620
I don't know what you have got against me,

426
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,340
but here's my advice.

427
00:21:09,730 --> 00:21:11,180
Don't cross a line.

428
00:21:11,500 --> 00:21:13,620
You don't want me to punch you.

429
00:21:19,500 --> 00:21:20,300
Sir,

430
00:21:21,060 --> 00:21:21,820
it's cold outside.

431
00:21:22,420 --> 00:21:23,580
Why don't you go get some rest?

432
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:27,810
Ruoyu,

433
00:21:28,860 --> 00:21:31,220
I need your help tomorrow.

434
00:21:32,660 --> 00:21:33,250
Sure.

435
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:39,540
Have some water, cousin-in-law.

436
00:21:43,900 --> 00:21:45,580
Congratulations.

437
00:21:46,060 --> 00:21:49,140
You and my cousin are a perfect match.

438
00:21:49,450 --> 00:21:51,020
I envy you so much.

439
00:21:53,620 --> 00:21:55,460
My cousin is much better than my husband.

440
00:21:56,620 --> 00:21:58,020
Your husband?

441
00:21:58,700 --> 00:21:59,940
Li Chengxi, the guy who hugged you

442
00:21:59,940 --> 00:22:01,460
in the hall during the day.

443
00:22:01,740 --> 00:22:02,490
He's your husband?

444
00:22:02,900 --> 00:22:03,730
Cousin-in-law,

445
00:22:03,980 --> 00:22:05,740
don't be fooled by his appearance.

446
00:22:05,940 --> 00:22:07,780
In fact, he is a sloppy man.

447
00:22:08,020 --> 00:22:09,620
He bathes in dirty ditches

448
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:11,290
and never wipes his ass after using the toilet.

449
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:12,060
Besides,

450
00:22:12,460 --> 00:22:13,820
his feet stink.

451
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:15,140
He also snores,

452
00:22:15,260 --> 00:22:16,500
grinds his teeth, and farts during sleep.

453
00:22:17,340 --> 00:22:17,940
But…

454
00:22:18,140 --> 00:22:19,060
But he doesn't look like

455
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:21,220
someone who has disgusting personal hygiene.

456
00:22:21,220 --> 00:22:21,940
Cousin-in-law,

457
00:22:22,340 --> 00:22:23,420
don't judge a book by its cover.

458
00:22:23,660 --> 00:22:25,780
Don't be fooled by his appearance.

459
00:22:26,380 --> 00:22:28,100
And most importantly,

460
00:22:28,460 --> 00:22:30,940
he's violent and enjoys beating women.

461
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:33,020
He carries a whip with him

462
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:34,700
so he can tie people up and beat them.

463
00:22:37,060 --> 00:22:37,540
Well…

464
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:42,300
Why did these words sound so familiar?

465
00:22:44,500 --> 00:22:45,140
Cousin-in-law,

466
00:22:45,700 --> 00:22:47,100
you've suffered a lot.

467
00:22:51,250 --> 00:22:53,300
Do you know what he did that hurt me the deepest?

468
00:22:53,300 --> 00:22:55,660
He messes around with other women just because he's handsome.

469
00:22:56,340 --> 00:22:58,180
He called me baby and said he loved me,

470
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,740
but the next second, he hugged you in the hall.

471
00:23:02,220 --> 00:23:03,740
He is actually such a scumbag.

472
00:23:04,740 --> 00:23:05,220
Cousin,

473
00:23:05,580 --> 00:23:06,780
I'll teach him a lesson for you.

474
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:08,540
I'll go beat him up now.

475
00:23:09,620 --> 00:23:10,340
Actually...

476
00:23:10,820 --> 00:23:12,500
Actually, I love him for who he is.

477
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:13,900
The more of a jerk he is,

478
00:23:14,660 --> 00:23:15,780
the more I love him.

479
00:23:19,740 --> 00:23:20,300
Well…

480
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:23,460
Since you love him so much,

481
00:23:23,860 --> 00:23:26,060
you must be very happy living with him.

482
00:23:28,780 --> 00:23:29,980
You are right.

483
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,490
If I'm to tell you all the stories between him and me,

484
00:23:33,740 --> 00:23:35,810
it'll take at least three days and nights.

485
00:23:37,140 --> 00:23:39,860
We met on a dark night.

486
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:41,420
He came from the sky

487
00:23:41,620 --> 00:23:43,300
and held me. We then spun in the air.

488
00:23:43,300 --> 00:23:45,050
To tell you all the stories between him and me,

489
00:23:45,050 --> 00:23:46,780
it'll take at least three days and nights.

490
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:49,420
You've said that hundreds of times.

491
00:23:51,380 --> 00:23:51,860
Go take a nap.

492
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:54,140
Have some rest.

493
00:23:55,420 --> 00:23:56,860
I'm not done yet.

494
00:24:19,340 --> 00:24:21,730
[Yan, I'll wait for you in the suburb.]

495
00:24:24,420 --> 00:24:26,100
I never knew my cousin was so romantic.

496
00:24:26,220 --> 00:24:27,290
He sent a pigeon to give you the letter.

497
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,580
Your cousin wants to see me.

498
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:31,860
I gotta go.

499
00:24:32,660 --> 00:24:33,180
Okay.

500
00:24:33,460 --> 00:24:34,740
Don't keep him waiting.

501
00:24:35,180 --> 00:24:36,300
Let's continue when you come back.

502
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,660
Small gourds for sale.

503
00:24:52,660 --> 00:24:53,860
Take a look.

504
00:24:54,260 --> 00:24:55,260
Hello, would you like to buy one?

505
00:24:55,780 --> 00:24:56,380
Yan.

506
00:24:57,620 --> 00:24:58,140
Yan.

507
00:24:58,380 --> 00:24:58,940
Sir.

508
00:25:00,020 --> 00:25:00,780
Take a look.

509
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:05,100
Small gourds for sale.

510
00:25:06,700 --> 00:25:07,940
Come and have a look.

511
00:25:13,100 --> 00:25:13,780
Li Jian.

512
00:25:15,060 --> 00:25:16,100
Why are you here?

513
00:25:19,180 --> 00:25:20,690
What's your name, miss?

514
00:25:21,530 --> 00:25:22,770
It's fate

515
00:25:23,210 --> 00:25:25,180
that we met in the wilderness.

516
00:25:25,660 --> 00:25:27,060
Are you crazy?

517
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:29,420
That is what you said to me

518
00:25:29,860 --> 00:25:30,940
when we first met.

519
00:25:32,220 --> 00:25:33,140
Do you remember?

520
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:37,020
Well,

521
00:25:38,330 --> 00:25:40,220
that does sound like

522
00:25:40,220 --> 00:25:41,020
something I would say.

523
00:25:44,700 --> 00:25:45,490
I know.

524
00:25:46,100 --> 00:25:47,900
As the Young Mistress of the Tang Sect,

525
00:25:48,380 --> 00:25:49,490
I'm powerful

526
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:50,500
and smart.

527
00:25:50,700 --> 00:25:53,100
It's understandable that you've fallen in love with me.

528
00:25:53,580 --> 00:25:54,180
However,

529
00:25:54,580 --> 00:25:56,620
I've found my Destined One.

530
00:25:56,780 --> 00:25:57,380
You...

531
00:25:57,820 --> 00:25:58,940
You should forget me.

532
00:25:59,500 --> 00:26:00,300
Besides,

533
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:02,420
you can't let Shen Yi down.

534
00:26:02,580 --> 00:26:03,770
What does it have to do with her?

535
00:26:04,460 --> 00:26:05,020
Well…

536
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:06,740
I just invited you here to tell you

537
00:26:06,930 --> 00:26:08,420
that we've found another way

538
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:09,580
to cure your blood vessel disease.

539
00:26:09,660 --> 00:26:10,220
Stop.

540
00:26:10,820 --> 00:26:11,740
I won't believe

541
00:26:11,940 --> 00:26:13,340
a single word

542
00:26:13,340 --> 00:26:14,180
coming out of your mouth.

543
00:26:14,380 --> 00:26:16,620
You already have Shen Yi. Stop pestering me.

544
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,140
What are you doing?

545
00:26:19,420 --> 00:26:20,780
Are you trying to force me into submission?

546
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:21,540
Let go of me!

547
00:26:21,650 --> 00:26:22,420
Let go!

548
00:27:09,260 --> 00:27:10,340
Do you remember anything?

549
00:27:12,980 --> 00:27:13,980
Yeah, I remember.
