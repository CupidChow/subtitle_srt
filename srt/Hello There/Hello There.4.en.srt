[Hello There]

[Episode 4]

4
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:53,370
Arrest them!

5
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:00,860
Young Mistress!

6
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:09,770
Help!

7
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:28,300
I only used 10 percent of my power.

8
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:29,930
How could this happen?

9
00:01:31,820 --> 00:01:32,660
See?

10
00:01:33,289 --> 00:01:34,539
He is the murderer.

11
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,060
Let's see where you can go today.

12
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:37,380
Help me! Senior Sister!

13
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:37,860
Let's go!

14
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,220
Hurry!

15
00:01:39,780 --> 00:01:40,220
Yan.

16
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:41,020
-Catch them! -Catch them!

17
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:41,900
-Yan. -Hurry.

18
00:01:42,539 --> 00:01:43,140
Hurry!

19
00:01:48,580 --> 00:01:50,580
Don't kill me!

20
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:52,410
Are you kidding me? Ugly Monster.

21
00:01:52,820 --> 00:01:54,900
I am the greatest devil in the world.

22
00:01:55,180 --> 00:01:57,050
You're not afraid of me, but you're also hiding behind me.

23
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:58,900
Are you insulting me?

24
00:02:00,300 --> 00:02:02,140
Xue. Leave us for now.

25
00:02:02,380 --> 00:02:02,980
Why?

26
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:04,180
You'll be hungry again

27
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,860
if you don't find anything to eat now.

28
00:02:07,740 --> 00:02:08,860
I didn't have dinner

29
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:10,139
because of you, Ugly Monster!

30
00:02:10,740 --> 00:02:11,940
Brother, keep an eye on her.

31
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,980
I'll go get some food.

32
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:20,170
What do you want?

33
00:02:20,660 --> 00:02:21,460
I'm warning you.

34
00:02:21,579 --> 00:02:22,300
Don't do anything stupid.

35
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,220
My senior sister will come to save me soon.

36
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:28,100
Brother, I was wrong.

37
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:29,780
Please spare my life.

38
00:02:30,100 --> 00:02:31,820
Better to get rid of an enmity than keep it alive.

39
00:02:31,860 --> 00:02:33,500
Why don't we sit down

40
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,540
and have some tea?

41
00:02:34,579 --> 00:02:35,140
I really...

42
00:02:35,140 --> 00:02:35,820
Shut up!

43
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:49,420
Don't move.

44
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:08,860
As expected,

45
00:03:09,740 --> 00:03:11,620
Tang Buyan can increase my power of catalysis .

46
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:19,210
How do you feel?

47
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,020
Try to hit this tree

48
00:03:23,660 --> 00:03:25,100
with the power I just gave you.

49
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:36,980
Nothing has changed.

50
00:03:52,579 --> 00:03:53,260
Okay.

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:03:56,100
Let's go back.

52
00:04:03,460 --> 00:04:04,340
Look.

53
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:10,860
What's going on?

54
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:14,500
What happened?

55
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,100
When I first met you,

56
00:04:16,220 --> 00:04:18,019
you could make the tree blossom.

57
00:04:18,450 --> 00:04:20,620
Why does it work when I do this?

58
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:35,540
Do it.

59
00:04:47,140 --> 00:04:48,260
So,

60
00:04:48,659 --> 00:04:50,900
your power will urge these plants to grow old.

61
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:52,420
And the power I use

62
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,380
can reverse your power.

63
00:04:55,180 --> 00:04:55,940
Let's go.

64
00:04:56,980 --> 00:04:57,860
Go find Xue.

65
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:00,900
I need to go to the toilet.

66
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:04,460
I want to go to the forest.

67
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,340
Go ahead. I'll wait for you here.

68
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,500
Why are you here?

69
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:28,980
It's none of your business.

70
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:29,820
I...

71
00:05:29,940 --> 00:05:31,100
You want to run away, right?

72
00:05:31,620 --> 00:05:32,420
No.

73
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm here to relieve myself.

74
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:37,300
Okay. Then do it.

75
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:38,659
Let's go back together after that.

76
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:42,780
Why don't you take off your pants?

77
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:45,180
You... rogue!

78
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,260
Miss Tang.

79
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,580
Now that you're cleared of suspicion,

80
00:06:16,220 --> 00:06:17,780
it's time for you to fulfill your promise.

81
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,780
If he knows I lied to him,

82
00:06:20,260 --> 00:06:22,820
he will make me a mummy on the spot.

83
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:24,780
Yes.

84
00:06:24,940 --> 00:06:26,460
I did promise you.

85
00:06:26,820 --> 00:06:29,220
But Book of Yueque is such a precious thing,

86
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:31,340
I can't carry it

87
00:06:31,340 --> 00:06:32,220
with me.

88
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:35,420
Why don't you send me back to the Tang Sect?

89
00:06:35,580 --> 00:06:36,580
I'll take you to get it.

90
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:39,300
Are you trying to lure us to the Tang Sect

91
00:06:39,659 --> 00:06:40,930
and arrange for someone to arrest us?

92
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:43,020
No way.

93
00:06:43,180 --> 00:06:45,020
Am I that kind of person?

94
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:46,060
Right?

95
00:06:46,100 --> 00:06:48,090
Book of Yueque is engraved on a giant stone.

96
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:50,860
It can only appear on a full moon night.

97
00:06:51,820 --> 00:06:52,900
Since it's a giant stone,

98
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:54,659
how can we carry it?

99
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:55,980
That's right.

100
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:58,020
How could I forget that?

101
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,340
But don't worry.

102
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:02,460
The Tang Sect has many disciples.

103
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,860
We will definitely deliver it

104
00:07:04,860 --> 00:07:05,700
to you.

105
00:07:05,930 --> 00:07:07,060
Xuanqi Mountain, right?

106
00:07:08,020 --> 00:07:09,730
Leave it to me.

107
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:13,380
Book of Yueque is not engraved on the giant stone.

108
00:07:15,460 --> 00:07:17,060
Ugly Monster.

109
00:07:17,060 --> 00:07:18,180
How dare you lie to us!

110
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:19,460
You liar!

111
00:07:19,540 --> 00:07:20,700
Please spare my life.

112
00:07:21,820 --> 00:07:24,140
We Tang Sect have all kinds of martial arts.

113
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:27,220
Book of Yueque, Book of Rique and even Book of Mental Disorder.

114
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,180
You have everything you want anyway.

115
00:07:30,260 --> 00:07:31,780
Since you haven't practiced Book of Yueque,

116
00:07:32,210 --> 00:07:34,100
why can you use the power of catalysis?

117
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,659
What is the power of catalysis?

118
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,380
I don't know how to do it.

119
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:40,860
Didn't that tree come back to life

120
00:07:41,100 --> 00:07:42,540
just because you took my hand?

121
00:07:43,220 --> 00:07:44,580
You ugly monster!

122
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:45,450
How dare you get fresh with my brother

123
00:07:45,540 --> 00:07:46,540
when I'm not around?

124
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,060
Do you want to die?

125
00:07:48,420 --> 00:07:49,620
Can you figure it out?

126
00:07:49,620 --> 00:07:51,100
He took my hand first.

127
00:07:51,340 --> 00:07:52,659
And you devil

128
00:07:52,700 --> 00:07:54,180
always talk about killing people.

129
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,220
Aren't you afraid of being struck by lightning?

130
00:07:56,580 --> 00:07:57,340
I'm a devil.

131
00:07:57,340 --> 00:07:57,980
Lightning?

132
00:07:57,980 --> 00:07:58,980
Should I talk about saving people

133
00:07:58,980 --> 00:08:00,420
instead of killing people?

134
00:08:02,020 --> 00:08:03,180
Have you ever been struck by lightning?

135
00:08:04,940 --> 00:08:05,780
People like your brother

136
00:08:05,780 --> 00:08:07,100
are struck by lightning.

137
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:08,660
I'll kill you now.

138
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:09,540
You...

139
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:10,660
Stop!

140
00:08:10,820 --> 00:08:12,100
Help!

141
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:12,900
Don't run!

142
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,810
Don't chase me!

143
00:08:13,810 --> 00:08:14,380
I'll kill you!

144
00:08:14,380 --> 00:08:15,580
Boss, help me.

145
00:08:32,340 --> 00:08:33,500
Ugly Monster, I'll kill you!

146
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:34,179
Enough, stop chasing.

147
00:08:34,179 --> 00:08:34,820
Stop!

148
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:37,260
Alright, time to sleep.

149
00:08:52,380 --> 00:08:54,940
I'll run when they're asleep.

150
00:08:55,500 --> 00:08:58,420
Let the government arrest them tonight.

151
00:09:03,340 --> 00:09:05,580
Brother, tie her up with your rope.

152
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:06,620
Otherwise,

153
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,900
what if she runs away while we are asleep?

154
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:10,300
Devil.

155
00:09:10,770 --> 00:09:12,900
The hostages are human too. I need to sleep.

156
00:09:13,620 --> 00:09:16,700
Fine. Since you don't want to be tied,

157
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:19,220
it should be the same to break your tendon.

158
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:21,380
You... I...

159
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:26,260
Tie me up.

160
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:28,260
I like to be tied when sleeping.

161
00:09:28,460 --> 00:09:29,660
I feel safe.

162
00:09:31,540 --> 00:09:32,300
Tie me up.

163
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:42,540
Don't run away while we're asleep,

164
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,300
or I'll break your leg.

165
00:09:48,740 --> 00:09:50,380
Alright, go to sleep.

166
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,020
Why are you so close to her? Brother.

167
00:09:58,500 --> 00:09:59,340
No.

168
00:10:00,740 --> 00:10:02,020
You have to sleep on my side.

169
00:11:01,340 --> 00:11:02,460
Senior Sister.

170
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:08,820
Why did you lose so much weight?

171
00:11:11,060 --> 00:11:12,460
It's flat.

172
00:11:18,620 --> 00:11:19,700
Senior Sister.

173
00:12:03,860 --> 00:12:05,340
What are you doing?

174
00:12:05,460 --> 00:12:07,780
How could you molest me, you pervert?

175
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:10,220
Are you crazy?

176
00:12:10,820 --> 00:12:11,820
I molested you?

177
00:12:12,260 --> 00:12:13,740
What are you dreaming about?

178
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:15,500
Then why are you lying next to me?

179
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:16,900
What's wrong with me lying here?

180
00:12:17,220 --> 00:12:18,860
And why don't you say you molested me?

181
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,340
I molested you? I...

182
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:24,860
What's wrong with you?

183
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,740
Why did you bring a mummy back?

184
00:12:27,650 --> 00:12:29,060
Take a good look at this.

185

I love bunny heads.

I'm good at roasting rabbits.

Look.

I'll kill her now!

You've suffered, Yan.

Everything is under my control.

244
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:07,940
I know that

245
00:14:07,940 --> 00:14:10,300
the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain

246

hid here.

My lord, we've searched everywhere.

248
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:15,250
They are not here.

249
00:14:16,220 --> 00:14:17,060
Really?

250
00:14:17,180 --> 00:14:17,860
They are not here.

251
00:14:19,580 --> 00:14:21,500
They must be scared away

252
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,340
by my official authority.

253
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:25,580
Order the whole city to search for the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

254
00:14:25,780 --> 00:14:26,460
Yes.

255
00:14:29,650 --> 00:14:32,630
[Tang Sect]

256
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:37,460
Yan, are you hurt?

257
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:38,980
Did they do anything to you?

258
00:14:39,660 --> 00:14:41,020
Senior Sister, don't worry.

259
00:14:41,380 --> 00:14:42,060
I'm fine.

260
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:43,900
Those two little demons

261
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:45,660
are no match for me.

262
00:14:46,420 --> 00:14:47,460
At this point,

263
00:14:47,610 --> 00:14:48,620
you still haven't taken a serious look.

264
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:49,860
It's all my fault

265
00:14:50,620 --> 00:14:51,820
for not taking good care of you.

266
00:14:52,900 --> 00:14:54,180
I'm sorry for your brother's instructions.

267
00:14:54,220 --> 00:14:55,220
Senior Sister.

268
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:56,580
How could this be your fault?

269
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:59,620
We should blame the disciples

270
00:14:59,620 --> 00:15:01,100
for not training well.

271
00:15:01,340 --> 00:15:02,340
Their martial arts are too weak.

272
00:15:02,580 --> 00:15:04,900
That's why the Double Demons can take advantage of it.

273
00:15:05,460 --> 00:15:08,580
I must

274
00:15:08,580 --> 00:15:09,780
train them hard tomorrow.

275
00:15:10,820 --> 00:15:11,570
Yan.

276
00:15:12,100 --> 00:15:13,220
You can put your mind

277
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:14,620
on the affairs of the Tang Sect now.

278
00:15:15,220 --> 00:15:16,780
I'm really glad.

279
00:15:18,220 --> 00:15:19,740
You barely escaped death.

280
00:15:19,940 --> 00:15:21,900
Go back and rest.

281
00:15:23,180 --> 00:15:24,980
I'm sweating now.

282
00:15:25,220 --> 00:15:26,300
I need to take a shower first,

283
00:15:26,540 --> 00:15:27,780
so that I can sleep comfortably.

284

You two go and get me some water.

285
00:15:30,250 --> 00:15:31,580
Yes, Young Mistress.

286
00:15:39,700 --> 00:15:40,700
What happened?

287
00:15:41,140 --> 00:15:41,900
Come on.

288
00:15:41,980 --> 00:15:42,940
Tell me.

289
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:44,460
What is there to say?

290
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:46,060
Just gossip.

291
00:15:46,100 --> 00:15:47,420
Young Mistress will come soon.

292
00:15:47,460 --> 00:15:48,380
She won't come.

293
00:15:48,620 --> 00:15:49,540
Just tell me.

294

The water is so cold.

00:16:03,460 --> 00:16:04,140
Really?

299
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:10,780
It's not cold.

300
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:13,130
It's not cold?

301
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:21,330
It's not cold.

to ninety-nine-year-old men,

are all here.

309
00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:08,980
Do you know why I called you here?

310
00:17:09,140 --> 00:17:10,740
-No. -No.

311
00:17:14,380 --> 00:17:15,940
There were so many people

312
00:17:16,339 --> 00:17:17,819
when suppressing the coffin home,

313
00:17:18,050 --> 00:17:20,500
and someone could still kidnap me.

314
00:17:21,540 --> 00:17:23,420
As disciples of the Tang Sect,

315

First,

321
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:46,940
check if you practice diligently

322
00:17:47,140 --> 00:17:48,460
and whether your body is strong.

323

Why do I feel something is missing?

You three, take off your clothes.

328
00:18:44,700 --> 00:18:45,900
We need to do that too?

329
00:19:32,620 --> 00:19:33,660
Did you find anything?

330
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:36,860
You are not the one who killed the mummy in the coffin home.

331
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:40,300
First,

332
00:19:40,780 --> 00:19:43,250
the mummy's power in the coffin home is drained,

333

but the hair is still black.

334
00:19:45,460 --> 00:19:48,220
But the mummy you caused is white hair.

335
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,660
He obviously died of extreme aging.

336

Second,

337
00:19:52,620 --> 00:19:54,900
the mummies appeared a few months ago.

338

But you've only been in Shu for half a month.

00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:11,780
So you're not the real murderer

345
00:20:12,690 --> 00:20:15,100
and you won't kill me, right?

346
00:20:16,050 --> 00:20:17,500
Since you're not the murderer,

347
00:20:17,730 --> 00:20:19,260
why didn't you explain before?

348
00:20:19,700 --> 00:20:21,140
What's the use of explaining?

349
00:20:21,540 --> 00:20:23,300
People only see

350
00:20:23,300 --> 00:20:24,780
what they want to see.

351
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:29,900
Brother.

352
00:20:31,540 --> 00:20:32,180
I know.

353
00:20:32,780 --> 00:20:34,020
It's not nice

354
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:34,980
to be misunderstood.

355
00:20:35,810 --> 00:20:36,820
That's how

356
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:37,980
I got my reputation as a Demoness.

357
00:20:38,660 --> 00:20:40,300
But this

358
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:41,180
is the way of the world.

359
00:20:42,180 --> 00:20:44,100
Since we can't control others,

360
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:45,740
then regard what they said

361
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:47,300
as farts.

362
00:20:49,250 --> 00:20:51,100
Since you're not the murderer now,

363
00:20:51,770 --> 00:20:54,140
we are still good brothers.

364
00:20:59,060 --> 00:21:00,460
The murderer is from the Tang Sect.

365
00:21:01,220 --> 00:21:02,020
What?

366
00:21:02,300 --> 00:21:03,980
If the murderer wants to frame me,

367
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:05,900
he will surely destroy the evidence.

368
00:21:06,180 --> 00:21:08,260
So we must do it before the coroner examines the body.

369
00:21:09,260 --> 00:21:10,460
Last night I went to the coffin home

370
00:21:11,060 --> 00:21:12,300
and ran into the murderer.

371
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:15,090
He deliberately hid his moves during the fight.

372
00:21:15,420 --> 00:21:17,060
I hit his right arm with a whip.

373
00:21:17,410 --> 00:21:20,300
In a hurry, he escaped with the Tang Sect's martial arts.

374
00:21:20,700 --> 00:21:21,980
Tang Sect's martial arts?

375
00:21:22,660 --> 00:21:23,980
You... You must be mistaken.

376
00:21:24,020 --> 00:21:26,140
How could the murderer be a member of the Tang Sect?

377
00:21:27,620 --> 00:21:28,530
To catch a thief, you must find the stolen goods.

378
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:29,700
How about this?

379
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:32,220
Let me go back

380
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:34,620
and investigate everyone.

381
00:21:34,980 --> 00:21:37,300
Then we'll know ifhe's from the Tang Sect.

382
00:21:37,740 --> 00:21:38,460
Okay.

383
00:21:39,780 --> 00:21:40,620
Don't worry.

384
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:42,620
If the murderer is a member of the Tang Sect,

385
00:21:42,900 --> 00:21:44,380
I will find him personally.

386
00:21:44,580 --> 00:21:45,860
But if you go back like this,

387
00:21:47,250 --> 00:21:48,860
they will suspect you.

388
00:21:50,380 --> 00:21:51,450
What should I do?

389
00:21:57,700 --> 00:21:58,380
Boss.

390
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:01,020
What are you thinking?

391
00:22:02,940 --> 00:22:03,820
Nothing.

392
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:06,140
I'm going out for a walk.

393
00:22:06,300 --> 00:22:07,540
Let them continue.

394
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,260
You just escaped from the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

395
00:22:10,540 --> 00:22:12,380
What if you run into them again?

396
00:22:13,020 --> 00:22:13,940
Those two demons

397
00:22:13,940 --> 00:22:15,700
are being chased by the whole city.

398
00:22:16,380 --> 00:22:17,900
Who dares to make trouble?

399
00:22:18,060 --> 00:22:18,660
Let's go.

400
00:22:27,860 --> 00:22:28,820
Did you find anything?

401
00:22:29,620 --> 00:22:30,980
You would never think

402
00:22:31,340 --> 00:22:33,100
that person was Chang Feng.

403
00:22:33,900 --> 00:22:35,700
He's usually cautious and timid,

404
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:37,860
why did he kill those Teardrop Mole people?

405
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:39,900
The murderer is really from the Tang Sect.

406
00:22:40,500 --> 00:22:42,540
What are you waiting for? Let's arrest him now.

407
00:22:42,700 --> 00:22:43,420
Wait.

408
00:22:45,740 --> 00:22:46,930
How's the wound?

409
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,340
It's a whip wound.

410
00:22:48,610 --> 00:22:50,460
It's about this long.

411
00:22:51,780 --> 00:22:52,540
No.

412
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:54,580
Last night when I whipped,

413
00:22:54,820 --> 00:22:56,140
I used icy martial skill.

414
00:22:56,380 --> 00:22:57,900
The wound is more like the wound of a blade wound.

415
00:22:58,300 --> 00:22:59,860
If his wound was just a normal whip wound,

416
00:23:00,300 --> 00:23:01,500
he might not be the murderer.

417
00:23:01,980 --> 00:23:04,860
Why don't we catch him first?

418
00:23:05,180 --> 00:23:06,980
What if he uses some way

419
00:23:06,980 --> 00:23:07,940
to cover the wound?

420
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:10,380
Arrest him? Okay.

421
00:23:10,740 --> 00:23:12,940
No, if he is not the murderer,

422
00:23:13,300 --> 00:23:15,290
the real murderer will be alerted.

423
00:23:15,930 --> 00:23:17,380
There's no way out.

424
00:23:17,610 --> 00:23:18,860
Should we just sit doing nothing

425
00:23:19,140 --> 00:23:20,700
and wait for the murderer to commit another crime?

426
00:23:24,330 --> 00:23:25,100
Three days.

427
00:23:26,540 --> 00:23:27,500
According to my investigation,

428
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:30,100
there was only one mummy that died six months ago.

429
00:23:30,850 --> 00:23:31,980
And there were three mummies

430
00:23:31,980 --> 00:23:34,420
that died from six months ago to one month ago.

431
00:23:34,900 --> 00:23:36,540
There were four mummies

432
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,770
that died just in the last month.

433
00:23:39,020 --> 00:23:40,580
You mean

434
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:43,900
the murderer is committing crimes more and more frequently?

435
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:45,620
Now, every seven days,

436
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,610
the murderer kills one person.

437
00:23:47,300 --> 00:23:48,420
So, in three days,

438
00:23:48,900 --> 00:23:51,650
we can use this to lure the snake out of its hole.

439
00:23:51,900 --> 00:23:53,580
Good for you, Li Chengxi.

440
00:23:53,780 --> 00:23:56,020
You're almost as smart as me.

441
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:57,980
Our ideas

442
00:23:58,060 --> 00:23:59,900
are of course much better than yours. Ugly Monster.

443
00:24:01,220 --> 00:24:02,620
That's your brother's idea.

444
00:24:02,620 --> 00:24:03,780
It has nothing to do with you.

445
00:24:04,140 --> 00:24:06,820
Besides, people with a tear mole within a radius of 500 li

446
00:24:06,820 --> 00:24:08,460
are either dead or have escaped.

447
00:24:08,980 --> 00:24:10,620
Where can we find the bait?

448
00:24:13,290 --> 00:24:14,860
There are no Teardrop Mole people.

449
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:17,700
But we have a beauty.

450
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:21,490
We can use the beauty trap.

451
00:24:23,140 --> 00:24:25,500
You? Beauty?

452
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:27,620
You're disgusting.

453
00:24:27,770 --> 00:24:29,180
Are you blind?

454
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:31,900
Why am I not a beauty?

455
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:35,980
But with my fame in Shu,

456
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:38,180
I can't pretend to be the beauty.

457
00:24:38,860 --> 00:24:40,580
Then what's the use of your plan?

458
00:24:41,380 --> 00:24:42,380
I can't.

459
00:24:42,580 --> 00:24:43,780
But you can do it.

460
00:24:44,220 --> 00:24:45,340
I can disguise you.

461
00:24:45,500 --> 00:24:47,700
I'm sure that even your brother can't recognize you.

462
00:24:47,780 --> 00:24:48,500
Dream on.

463
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:50,380
How could I pretend to be a woman?

464
00:24:51,660 --> 00:24:52,820
If you can't,

465
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,620
your brother will have to do it.

466
00:24:54,860 --> 00:24:55,660
Don't even think about it.

467
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,420
I'm not doing it. And I won't allow my brother to do that either.

468
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,460
There's no way out.

469
00:24:59,540 --> 00:25:00,620
Do you have a better idea?

470
00:25:00,660 --> 00:25:01,180
I...

471
00:25:01,620 --> 00:25:03,700
The devil of Xuanqi Mountain?

472
00:25:03,820 --> 00:25:05,700
I think it's all bragging.

473
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:09,100
You're more like a rat from Xuanqi Mountain.

474
00:25:09,340 --> 00:25:11,420
Tang Buyan, you're the rat.

475
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:12,970
You just want me to pretend to be a woman.

476
00:25:13,340 --> 00:25:14,980
I'll do it. I'm not afraid.

477
00:25:23,340 --> 00:25:24,500
My junior brothers,

478
00:25:25,180 --> 00:25:26,420
why did Young Mistress ask me

479
00:25:26,420 --> 00:25:27,820
to purchase with you?

480
00:25:28,380 --> 00:25:29,220
Our boss thinks

481
00:25:29,220 --> 00:25:30,980
that Senior Sister has a lot of work to do,

482
00:25:30,980 --> 00:25:32,490
so she wants to give her an inkstone.

483
00:25:32,580 --> 00:25:34,460
But she doesn't know what kind of one she should give her.

484
00:25:34,900 --> 00:25:35,900
Senior Chang Feng.

485
00:25:35,900 --> 00:25:38,260
Aren't you the trusted subordinate of Senior Sister?

486
00:25:38,260 --> 00:25:40,490
And you manage so many things in the Tang Sect.

487
00:25:40,660 --> 00:25:41,380
I guess

488
00:25:41,460 --> 00:25:43,060
you must know her preferences.

489
00:25:43,780 --> 00:25:44,780
I see.

490
00:25:45,330 --> 00:25:47,500
It's really hard for Senior Sister to manage the Tangs.

491
00:25:48,580 --> 00:25:49,530
Young Mistress is very thoughtful.

492
00:25:50,340 --> 00:25:50,900
Let's go.

493
00:25:51,010 --> 00:25:51,540
Let's go.

494
00:26:53,210 --> 00:26:54,140
What's going on?

495
00:26:54,660 --> 00:26:56,060
Why is it different from the plan?

496
00:26:58,940 --> 00:27:00,260
You perverts!

497
00:27:00,540 --> 00:27:01,300
How dare you hit me?

498
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,700
It was you!

499
00:27:10,780 --> 00:27:12,780
Don't let me see you around the inn again.

500
00:27:13,060 --> 00:27:15,690
Or I'll beat you up every time I see you.

501
00:27:23,500 --> 00:27:25,300
You evil woman from the Western Region!

502
00:27:25,500 --> 00:27:26,660
Do you know who we are?

503
00:27:27,860 --> 00:27:29,140
You live in this inn, right?

504
00:27:29,900 --> 00:27:30,810
Wait for us.

505
00:27:30,570 --> 00:27:33,260
[Yunlai Inn]

506
00:28:10,980 --> 00:28:12,340
I finally caught you.

507
00:28:14,140 --> 00:28:14,860
Miss.

508
00:28:17,740 --> 00:28:19,700
It's dangerous here.

509
00:28:20,020 --> 00:28:21,100
Let me send you back.
