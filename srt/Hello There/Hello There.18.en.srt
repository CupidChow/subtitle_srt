00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:04,930
Oh, no! The Nightmarish Incense!

5
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:06,620
Run! Run!

6
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:07,660
Run!

7
00:01:08,180 --> 00:01:11,300
What are you saying, you old hag?

8
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,020
Don't make a sound.

9
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:06,670
Hush.

10
00:02:33,340 --> 00:02:34,020
Xue.

11
00:03:30,860 --> 00:03:31,660
Yan.

12
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:35,220
What you said in the illusion just now...

13
00:03:36,180 --> 00:03:37,620
All of them are my heartfelt words.

14
00:03:39,100 --> 00:03:40,420
I'm sorry, Li Chengxi.

15
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:43,540
I made you suffer a lot.

16
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:47,180
But I will never forget you again.

17
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:54,060
Me too.

18
00:03:54,980 --> 00:03:56,100
I'll never let you go again.

19
00:04:32,460 --> 00:04:33,340
Finally.

20
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:35,420
They are finally together.

21
00:04:36,500 --> 00:04:38,420
Such a touching scene.

22
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,409
You should take a good look!

23
00:04:41,620 --> 00:04:42,180
Look here.

24
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,340
See?

25
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:48,140
They are a perfect match.

26
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:50,180
Stop daydreaming!

27
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:51,540
There is no chance for you!

28
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,020
Put him in solitary confinement

29
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,740
until I'm satisfied.

30
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:10,220
By the way,

31
00:05:11,460 --> 00:05:12,420
Li Chengxi.

32
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,250
I want to find Li Jian.

33
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:16,620
He did help me a lot

34
00:05:17,100 --> 00:05:18,620
when I lost my memories.

35
00:05:18,860 --> 00:05:20,500
I think I should explain to him face-to-face

36
00:05:20,940 --> 00:05:23,620
why I can't marry him.

37
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:24,180
OK.

38
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:26,420
As long as it's what you want,

39
00:05:26,980 --> 00:05:27,820
we'll do it together.

40
00:05:38,620 --> 00:05:40,140
Your sweet words

41
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,140
make me blush.

42
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:47,620
I brought a perfect couple together.

43
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:50,260
I'm really meritorious.

44
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:51,780
By the way, Lord,

45
00:05:52,460 --> 00:05:53,980
where are our friends?

46
00:06:00,090 --> 00:06:00,820
Xue!

47
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:02,980
Xue!

48
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:07,300
Xue!

49
00:06:08,490 --> 00:06:09,180
Xue!

50
00:06:09,900 --> 00:06:10,420
Xue!

51
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:11,900
I don't want to be a shadow.

52
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,100
I don't want to be a shadow.

53
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:22,020
You're awake.

54
00:06:22,540 --> 00:06:23,100
Xue.

55
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:26,500
Brother.

56
00:06:30,180 --> 00:06:32,580
I just dreamed of Li Chengtian again.

57
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,540
He's still the same. So pretentious.

58
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:36,780
He asked me to call him Uncle. How does he deserves it!

59
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,460
What kind of uncle is he?

60
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:42,220
What?

61
00:06:43,060 --> 00:06:44,420
You two are Li Chengtian's nephews?

62
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,420
What a sin!

63
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,860
What a sin!

64
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:03,300
Let me out!

65
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:04,500
Let me out!

66
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:06,180
Let me out!

67
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,780
Why didn't you tell me

68
00:07:15,260 --> 00:07:16,980
that he is Li Chengtian's nephew?

69
00:07:18,820 --> 00:07:20,860
I even set him up with that girl.

70
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:25,380
Li Chengtian!

71
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:27,060
You failed me.

72
00:07:27,540 --> 00:07:29,500
You made me suffer all my life!

73
00:07:30,580 --> 00:07:32,340
Now the boys from your family

74
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,340
are going out to harm other girls!

75
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:37,210
You are really a haunting ghost.

76
00:07:42,890 --> 00:07:43,700
Li Chengtian

77
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:46,780
is my biological father?

78
00:07:55,100 --> 00:07:56,020
My son.

79
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,659
You look

80
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:01,740
just like Li Chengtian.

81
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:05,540
That's why I feel disgusted every time I see you.

82
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:07,220
I asked you to wear a mask

83
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:08,820
because I didn't want to see your face.

84
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:10,300
I didn't expect...

85
00:08:10,900 --> 00:08:12,060
I just didn't expect

86
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:15,100
that the poison seeds from your Li family would be so haunting.

87
00:08:15,700 --> 00:08:17,780
One after another.

88
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,540
You guys are everywhere!

89
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:22,140
Get out!

90
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:24,020
Get out of here!

91
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,610
Get out!

92
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:43,940
If you dare to take it off,

93
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:45,780
I'll kill you.

94
00:08:46,170 --> 00:08:46,660
Hurry!

95
00:08:47,010 --> 00:08:47,620
Cousin.

96
00:08:48,660 --> 00:08:49,460
Come and chase me.

97
00:08:50,860 --> 00:08:51,660
Cousin.

98
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:53,820
Take off your mask and let me see your face,

99
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:54,620
OK?

100
00:08:59,300 --> 00:09:00,100
Fine.

101
00:09:08,420 --> 00:09:09,140
Go away.

102
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,340
Who told you to take off your mask?

103
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:13,580
Who told you to take it off?

104
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,620
Who told you to take it off?

105
00:09:14,780 --> 00:09:16,300
How dare you!

106
00:09:17,660 --> 00:09:18,700
Who told you to take it off!

107
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,140
Who told you to take it off!

108
00:09:29,470 --> 00:09:32,880
[Serene Valley]

109
00:09:39,860 --> 00:09:41,850
Get lost! Don't come back again if you leave!

110
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,100
We are all the same.

111
00:09:58,890 --> 00:10:00,940
No one can choose their origin.

112
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:03,580
But we can choose our own lives.

113
00:10:04,740 --> 00:10:05,540
Hold tight!

114
00:10:06,700 --> 00:10:08,500
Let me go, or we'll all fall!

115
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:10,380
I will never give up on my friends!

116
00:10:11,540 --> 00:10:13,260
You're so handsome.

117
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,300
Then why are you wearing a mask?

118
00:10:15,780 --> 00:10:16,700
Don't wear it anymore.

119
00:10:16,980 --> 00:10:18,140
I'm here.

120
00:10:18,340 --> 00:10:20,860
No one will bully you anymore!

121
00:10:23,260 --> 00:10:25,460
I'm Yan's Destined One.

122
00:10:26,620 --> 00:10:27,420
Li Chengxi.

123
00:10:28,940 --> 00:10:29,820
If it weren't for you,

124
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:33,420
Yan and I would have long been together.

125
00:10:38,460 --> 00:10:39,250
Yan.

126
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:41,660
No matter what it takes,

127
00:10:43,100 --> 00:10:44,860
even if I have to destroy Li Chengxi

128
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:47,980
and all obstacles,

129
00:10:49,770 --> 00:10:51,940
I'll have you by my side.

130
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:31,220
I've thought about

131
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:33,020
what you suggested last time.

132
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,460
I can help you get the Book of Yueque.

133
00:11:38,180 --> 00:11:39,340
But when it's done,

134
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:41,700
you have to kill

135
00:11:43,540 --> 00:11:45,220
Li Chengxi for me.

136
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,660
As I expected.

137
00:11:49,820 --> 00:11:50,860
In that case,

138
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:53,050
let's form an alliance

139
00:11:53,460 --> 00:11:54,660
and work together.

140
00:12:16,780 --> 00:12:18,020
What's going on?

141
00:12:18,300 --> 00:12:19,500
Why are you two sitting so close?

142
00:12:21,090 --> 00:12:21,610
Shh.

143
00:12:33,860 --> 00:12:34,380
Get up!

144
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:38,060
You can't be with that sweet young thing!

145
00:12:38,860 --> 00:12:41,060
Didn't you set us up before?

146
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:43,060
Why are you trying to break us apart now?

147
00:12:43,060 --> 00:12:45,460
That's because I was blind before.

148
00:12:45,780 --> 00:12:46,780
I can't believe I didn't see that

149
00:12:46,780 --> 00:12:49,060
this guy is actually Li Chengtian's nephew.

150
00:12:49,540 --> 00:12:52,060
All men from the Li family deserve to die alone

151
00:12:52,100 --> 00:12:53,100
and die miserably.

152
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:55,220
You two must not get together!

153
00:12:55,890 --> 00:12:56,700
Lord.

154
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:58,700
We are not the puppets you made.

155
00:12:58,700 --> 00:12:59,660
You can't control us.

156
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:02,260
And I'll never leave him again.

157
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:04,660
Why are you so ungrateful?

158
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:05,940
I did it for your own good!

159
00:13:06,180 --> 00:13:08,730
I don't know what grudges you have against Li Chengtian,

160
00:13:09,100 --> 00:13:11,060
but I can't change my family background.

161
00:13:11,860 --> 00:13:12,660
Besides,

162
00:13:13,300 --> 00:13:15,620
Xue and I have long left the Lingjue Sect.

163
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:17,660
And we have nothing to do with him.

164
00:13:17,660 --> 00:13:19,180
That's right. That scumbag.

165
00:13:19,180 --> 00:13:20,460
What kind of uncle is he?

166
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:25,700
Well said. I like that.

167
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,700
Lord, if you want to hear me scolding him more,

168
00:13:31,180 --> 00:13:33,100
I can scold him

169
00:13:33,100 --> 00:13:34,620
from morning to night, unrepeated.

170
00:13:35,220 --> 00:13:36,020
But

171
00:13:36,300 --> 00:13:39,100
our Tang family has a century-old blood vessel disease.

172
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:40,820
The Book of Yueque

173
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,900
may be my last hope of survival.

174
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:44,420
You don't want

175
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,460
the world

176
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:46,060
to miss a person

177
00:13:46,060 --> 00:13:47,780
who will curse Li Chengtian with you, right?

178
00:13:48,300 --> 00:13:49,090
Tang Sect?

179
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:51,980
Why does it sound so familiar?

180
00:13:52,980 --> 00:13:55,060
No. I've heard it somewhere.

181
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:57,060
Where did I hear it?

182
00:13:59,370 --> 00:14:00,380
The Book of Yueque, right?

183
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:00,820
Yes.

184
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:02,940
Come. Come with me and get it.

185
00:14:03,020 --> 00:14:03,460
Okay.

186
00:14:08,460 --> 00:14:09,740
Then I'll never let you

187
00:14:09,740 --> 00:14:11,700
be with that boy!

188
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:14,060
Even if he has left the Lingjue Sect,

189
00:14:14,460 --> 00:14:16,210
he is still a poison seed from the Li family.

190
00:14:16,900 --> 00:14:17,890
He doesn't deserve you.

191
00:14:19,130 --> 00:14:20,980
I've made up my mind.

192
00:14:22,140 --> 00:14:23,380
I want to be with him even if I die.

193
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,580
No one can break us apart.

194
00:14:26,020 --> 00:14:26,820
You...

195
00:14:27,420 --> 00:14:29,100
Why are you so stubborn?

196
00:14:30,060 --> 00:14:31,060
In that case,

197
00:14:31,300 --> 00:14:32,860
I can only kill him

198
00:14:33,140 --> 00:14:34,860
to end your ill-fated relationship.

199
00:14:49,460 --> 00:14:50,250
Wait for me here.

200
00:14:50,300 --> 00:14:51,100
Don't go out.

201
00:14:51,460 --> 00:14:52,100
Be careful.

202
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:02,580
Brother, let me help you!

203
00:15:03,580 --> 00:15:04,900
Xue! Xue!

204
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:22,100
Lord, we don't have to be like this.

205
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:24,140
Please show us some mercy.

206
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:26,610
Let's talk, Lord!

207
00:15:37,820 --> 00:15:38,500
Watch out!

208
00:15:45,500 --> 00:15:46,260
Maniac!

209
00:16:12,700 --> 00:16:14,380
I'll kill them all!

210
00:16:30,260 --> 00:16:30,900
Are you alright?

211
00:16:30,900 --> 00:16:31,980
Did you get hurt?

212
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:33,420
I'm fine.

213
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:41,380
How dare you ruin my puppets!

214
00:16:41,700 --> 00:16:42,900
I'll avenge them!

215
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,380
Lord, calm down, please!

216
00:16:46,540 --> 00:16:47,100
Lord!

217
00:16:47,380 --> 00:16:48,780
This kind of demon deserves to die.

218
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:50,380
But the reason Yun Gaixue is acting this way

219
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,820
is all Li Chengtian's fault

220
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:54,100
Li Chengtian?

221
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,420
Li Chengtian! Li Chengtian!

222
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:02,420
All the men from the Li family are bad.

223
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:04,380
Li Chengtian is Li Chengtian.

224
00:17:04,579 --> 00:17:05,579
They are them.

225
00:17:06,740 --> 00:17:08,420
Yun Gaixue hurt these puppets

226
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:10,050
because he was possessed.

227
00:17:10,940 --> 00:17:12,819
Although they are relatives of Li Chengtian,

228
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,690
their parents died when they were young.

229
00:17:15,460 --> 00:17:16,420
And he forced them

230
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,460
to master the martial skill of fighting against each other.

231
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:21,220
They don't want to hurt each other,

232
00:17:21,579 --> 00:17:23,060
so they became like this.

233
00:17:23,900 --> 00:17:25,220
Brothers hurting each other.

234
00:17:27,490 --> 00:17:29,100
What a pity.

235
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:32,060
You are all Li Chengtian's victims.

236
00:17:32,530 --> 00:17:33,220
So,

237
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,460
why do the poor have to make things difficult for the poor?

238
00:17:38,340 --> 00:17:39,140
Fine.

239
00:17:40,420 --> 00:17:42,340
Since we are in the same boat,

240
00:17:42,740 --> 00:17:44,220
I won't kill them.

241
00:17:45,380 --> 00:17:46,220
Thank you, Lord.

242
00:17:49,820 --> 00:17:50,340
Lord.

243
00:17:50,620 --> 00:17:52,220
Do you know where Li Jian is?

244
00:17:52,260 --> 00:17:53,740
Don't mention that unfilial kid to me again.

245
00:17:54,900 --> 00:17:55,540
Also,

246
00:17:55,780 --> 00:17:56,820
you two from the Li family,

247
00:17:57,060 --> 00:17:58,300
don't ever show up in front of me again.

248
00:17:58,300 --> 00:17:58,980
Get lost now!

249
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:03,100
By the way,

250
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:06,500
where is the Book of Yueque?

251
00:18:06,500 --> 00:18:07,300
The Book of Yueque?

252
00:18:10,180 --> 00:18:11,380
Where is the Book of Yueque?

253
00:18:12,290 --> 00:18:12,980
The Book...

254
00:18:13,700 --> 00:18:14,660
Leave me alone.

255
00:18:14,940 --> 00:18:16,490
I'll tell you when I find it.

256
00:18:18,570 --> 00:18:19,540
Where is the Book of Yueque?

257
00:18:20,980 --> 00:18:21,940
Where is it?

258
00:18:22,220 --> 00:18:22,740
Lord.

259
00:18:24,780 --> 00:18:25,300
Xue.

260
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:34,570
-Physician Yan. -Maniac!

261
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:35,140
Brother Yan!

262
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,660
Why are you acting tough?

263
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,500
I'm so powerful. I don't need your help.

264
00:18:58,260 --> 00:18:59,820
Now you got hurt, and I have to take care of you.

265
00:19:00,660 --> 00:19:01,250
Water.

266
00:19:10,340 --> 00:19:10,820
Here!

267
00:19:16,660 --> 00:19:17,660
My arm...

268
00:19:18,900 --> 00:19:20,300
Forget it.

269
00:19:23,060 --> 00:19:23,620
Here.

270
00:19:27,660 --> 00:19:28,940
May you choke to death.

271
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,380
Drink, drink!

272
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,500
I don't feel well either, lying here like this.

273
00:19:37,900 --> 00:19:38,580
If only

274
00:19:38,580 --> 00:19:41,060
someone could adjust my position for me.

275
00:19:42,980 --> 00:19:43,620
Here.

276
00:19:47,420 --> 00:19:48,420
Slow down.

277
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:54,700
Are you feeling better?

278
00:19:58,300 --> 00:20:00,860
The bed is a little cold, too.

279
00:20:06,900 --> 00:20:08,220
You are not thinking of me warming your bed,

280
00:20:08,220 --> 00:20:08,700
right?

281
00:20:09,980 --> 00:20:12,420
I just want you to get me a hot water bottle.

282
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,460
There's nothing here!

283
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:15,140
Why should I have to serve you?

284
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:16,660
By the way,

285
00:20:17,180 --> 00:20:19,700
remember to bring me some food when you come back.

286
00:20:23,140 --> 00:20:23,940
Just wait!

287
00:20:54,460 --> 00:20:55,260
Yan.

288
00:20:56,620 --> 00:20:58,260
We'll find the Book of Yueque.

289
00:20:59,740 --> 00:21:00,540
Don't worry.

290
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,700
♫Is it right or wrong to let go♫

291
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:05,700

292

♫With a heart beating warm but pretending to be cold♫

293

295

♫We can't escape the torture♫

297
00:21:15,500 --> 00:21:17,100
you have to live well.

298
00:21:17,700 --> 00:21:19,500
I told you not to talk nonsense.

299
00:21:20,660 --> 00:21:21,500
I told you.

300
00:21:22,460 --> 00:21:23,820
I'll cure you.

301
00:21:22,810 --> 00:21:27,010
♫Your figure is very thin♫

302

♫You said to me♫

313
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:42,340
Li Jian.

314
00:22:42,900 --> 00:22:44,500
Where have you been these days?

315
00:22:44,580 --> 00:22:45,820
We were all worried about you.

316
00:22:48,140 --> 00:22:48,930
I was

317
00:22:50,620 --> 00:22:51,780
caught by that woman.

318
00:22:52,380 --> 00:22:53,900
And I was locked up in the room for a few days.

319
00:22:55,980 --> 00:22:58,220
Was it the Lord of the Valley who whipped you?

320
00:23:01,580 --> 00:23:02,980
She blamed me for taking off my mask.

321
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:05,730
It's all my fault.

322
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:08,100
I shouldn't have let you take off your mask.

323
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:11,100
Your wounds are so bad. It must hurt.

324
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:14,660
It's okay.

325
00:23:15,460 --> 00:23:16,500
She always hated me.

326
00:23:17,290 --> 00:23:18,300
I'm used to it.

327
00:23:22,820 --> 00:23:24,180
Go back and apply some medicine.

328
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,540
Have a good rest.

329
00:23:29,780 --> 00:23:30,660
Thank you, Yan.

330
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:33,340
Thanks to you…

331
00:23:34,100 --> 00:23:34,900
Actually,

332
00:23:36,180 --> 00:23:37,740
I have regained my memory.

333
00:23:40,540 --> 00:23:42,460
I can't marry you

334
00:23:42,460 --> 00:23:43,500
like I promised.

335
00:23:46,090 --> 00:23:46,900
I...

336
00:23:51,100 --> 00:23:53,420
I still want to be with the one I love.

337
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:05,820
I'm sorry.

338
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,380
It's okay.

339
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:10,660
You don't have to blame yourself.

340
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,260
Love

341
00:24:12,940 --> 00:24:14,050
can't be forced.

342
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:15,980
In that case,

343
00:24:17,100 --> 00:24:17,900
our engagement

344
00:24:19,580 --> 00:24:20,460
is annulled.

345
00:24:23,860 --> 00:24:24,660
Thank you.

346
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:28,770
Then I should

347
00:24:29,460 --> 00:24:30,300
go back to my room now.

348
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:51,740
What's wrong?

349
00:24:55,180 --> 00:24:55,860
Nothing.

350
00:25:26,220 --> 00:25:26,810
I found it.

351
00:25:27,300 --> 00:25:28,220
I found it!

352
00:25:28,580 --> 00:25:29,220
Right here.

353
00:25:29,620 --> 00:25:30,820
You found it so soon.

354
00:25:33,020 --> 00:25:34,860
How dare you show up in front of me?

355
00:25:35,580 --> 00:25:36,620
I'll kill you!

356
00:25:36,620 --> 00:25:37,530
Lord! Lord!

357
00:25:37,530 --> 00:25:39,060
The Book of Yueque. The Book!

358
00:25:40,380 --> 00:25:41,180
Yes.

359
00:25:41,700 --> 00:25:42,620
This painting

360
00:25:44,140 --> 00:25:45,620
will tell you where the Book of Yueque is.

361
00:25:47,460 --> 00:25:48,460
Where the Book of Yueque is?

362
00:25:48,940 --> 00:25:49,780
What do you mean?

363
00:25:54,860 --> 00:25:55,380
Lord?

364
00:25:56,660 --> 00:25:57,660
Lord!

365
00:26:02,060 --> 00:26:05,050
What the hell is this drawing?

366
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:08,980
The Book

367
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:10,940
of

368
00:26:12,300 --> 00:26:12,900
Yueque.

369
00:26:15,500 --> 00:26:17,140
The waning moon is the Book of Yueque.

370
00:26:17,300 --> 00:26:18,420
The Book is in the sky.

371
00:26:27,820 --> 00:26:28,660
I see.

372
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,860
Isn't the moon reflected in the well?

373
00:26:31,020 --> 00:26:33,060
It means that the Book is in this well.

374
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,260
You see. Pretty much what I said.

375
00:26:35,740 --> 00:26:37,140
Since we've figured it out,

376
00:26:37,140 --> 00:26:37,860
what are we waiting for?

377
00:26:37,940 --> 00:26:38,660
Let's go and find it!

378
00:26:39,380 --> 00:26:41,700
Wait. You know where this well is?

379
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:43,300
Smarty pants. Do you know where the book is?

380
00:26:43,330 --> 00:26:44,140
Of course,

381
00:26:44,900 --> 00:26:45,620
I don't know.

382
00:26:46,100 --> 00:26:47,500
But Li Jian should know.

383
00:26:48,020 --> 00:26:49,500
You are familiar with things in the Valley.

384
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,860
Do you know where the well is?

385
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:53,420
But

386
00:26:54,100 --> 00:26:55,290
there are so many wells in the Serene Valley.

387
00:26:55,780 --> 00:26:56,980
Which one is it?

388
00:26:56,980 --> 00:26:57,900
There's a tree

389
00:26:58,100 --> 00:26:59,140
beside the well in the painting.

390
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,100
And there's a puppet reading under the tree.

391
00:27:01,580 --> 00:27:03,060
Yan, I'm sorry.

392
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:04,980
I've never been to this place.

393
00:27:05,580 --> 00:27:07,420
It's okay. The Valley is just this big.

394
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:08,330
We can definitely find it.

395
00:27:11,420 --> 00:27:12,260
In that case,

396
00:27:12,780 --> 00:27:14,010
let's split up.

397
00:27:14,700 --> 00:27:15,700
I'll team up with Yan.

398
00:27:16,180 --> 00:27:17,660
Brother Yan and Xue are a team.

399
00:27:17,940 --> 00:27:19,660
Mr. Li is familiar with the valley.

400
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:21,300
So you can go and find it alone,

401
00:27:21,700 --> 00:27:22,260
right?

402
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:23,660
Sure.

403
00:27:23,940 --> 00:27:24,460
Let's go!

404
00:27:24,580 --> 00:27:25,620
Let's go.

405
00:27:25,860 --> 00:27:26,860
Let's go.

406
00:27:36,660 --> 00:27:37,330
All right.

407
00:27:38,020 --> 00:27:39,060
Let's split up.

408
00:27:39,580 --> 00:27:40,980
Yan and I will go this way.

409
00:27:41,220 --> 00:27:42,420
Okay, we'll go that way.

410
00:27:42,580 --> 00:27:43,420
In that case,

411
00:27:43,620 --> 00:27:44,780
I'll go this way.

412
00:27:45,100 --> 00:27:46,380
Be careful.

413
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:33,540
What can I do for you?

414
00:28:34,660 --> 00:28:36,140
I hope you keep your promise.

415
00:28:36,580 --> 00:28:37,780
Kill Li Chengxi.

416
00:28:39,180 --> 00:28:40,060
Don't worry.

417
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:42,090
After I get the Book of Yueque,

418
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:44,100
I won't spare his life.

419
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,700
That book is in the well.

420
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:49,700
Okay.

421
00:28:59,660 --> 00:29:00,620
I just found this place,

422
00:29:00,810 --> 00:29:01,650
and you came.

423
00:29:24,220 --> 00:29:25,340
You're hiding your face.

424
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,420
Let's see who you really are!
