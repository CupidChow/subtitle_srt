174
00:11:20,540 --> 00:11:21,700
Yan may be naughty,

175
00:11:21,940 --> 00:11:22,980
but she's a kind girl.

176
00:11:23,330 --> 00:11:24,420
There must be misunderstandings.

177
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:25,540
Please investigate it.

178
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,490
Misunderstandings?

179
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,860
How is that possible?

180
00:11:28,260 --> 00:11:29,500
There is a witness who can testify

181
00:11:30,100 --> 00:11:33,210
that Tang Buyan often harasses men

182
00:11:33,340 --> 00:11:34,780
who have a teardrop mole on the street.

183
00:11:34,980 --> 00:11:36,180
We have witness and evidence.

184
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:37,580
What more do you need?

185
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:39,140
Hurry and hand over Tang Buyan.

186
00:11:39,140 --> 00:11:40,340
I, Tang Buyan, am here.

187
00:11:40,770 --> 00:11:41,610
Let's see who dares to take me.

188
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,780
Tang Buyan, how dare you!

189
00:11:43,580 --> 00:11:45,980
In broad daylight,

190
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:47,660
how dare you, a suspect in murders and body dumps,

191
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:49,580
be so arrogant?

192
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:52,340
Stop talking nonsense!

193
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:53,580
Yan.

194
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,780
Who did I kill? And whose body did I dump!

195
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,660
What Know-It-All?

196
00:11:58,010 --> 00:11:59,420
You're more like a big fool!

197
00:11:59,620 --> 00:12:00,900
You should retire and go back to your hometown now.

198
00:12:00,900 --> 00:12:01,700
Stop being the scourge to the people here.

199
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:02,380
You...

200
00:12:04,220 --> 00:12:05,260
How dare you...

201
00:12:05,940 --> 00:12:07,460
How dare you question me?

202
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:09,580
You think I don't know, right?

203
00:12:10,020 --> 00:12:11,740
I'll make you convinced today.

204
00:12:12,140 --> 00:12:12,820
Let me ask you.

205
00:12:13,100 --> 00:12:15,340
Someone saw several mummies

206
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:18,580
at the foot of the mountain.

207
00:12:20,490 --> 00:12:21,420
These bodies' faces

208
00:12:21,940 --> 00:12:23,980
can't be seen clearly,

209
00:12:24,540 --> 00:12:26,370
but how can they escape

210
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:28,890
my sharp eyes?

211
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:30,370
I saw through them at one glance.

212
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:32,300
They have a common characteristic.

213
00:12:32,580 --> 00:12:33,180
That is, they all have a teardrop mole

214
00:12:33,460 --> 00:12:34,940
on their faces.

215
00:12:35,340 --> 00:12:38,180
And all these dead people, the men with a teardrop mole,

216
00:12:38,370 --> 00:12:41,140
were all teased by you in public.

217
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:42,370
So what?

218
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:44,420
Do I have to kill them just because I've teased them?

219
00:12:46,300 --> 00:12:46,980
You…

220
00:12:48,650 --> 00:12:49,780
I'm teasing you now.

221
00:12:49,780 --> 00:12:50,260
Yan.

222
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:51,700
Do I have to kill you too?

223
00:12:52,620 --> 00:12:53,460
I'm so angry.

224
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:55,140
Let me ask you.

225
00:12:55,700 --> 00:12:57,980
Did you threaten a man with a teardrop mole on the street

226
00:12:57,980 --> 00:13:00,420
saying that you would kill him?

227
00:13:00,780 --> 00:13:01,580
Is that true?

228
00:13:02,140 --> 00:13:02,700
My lord.

229
00:13:02,820 --> 00:13:04,700
Yan is still a child.

230
00:13:05,180 --> 00:13:06,180
It's just a joke.

231
00:13:06,380 --> 00:13:07,100
A joke?

232
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:09,540
Chief Lan, are you kidding me?

233
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:11,100
Without any evidence,

234
00:13:11,180 --> 00:13:12,610
how can I just come to your door and arrest her?

235
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,020
Do you recognize this?

236
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:30,340
How do you have my bead?

237
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:31,180
Tang Buyan,

238
00:13:31,970 --> 00:13:33,820
you're quite bold.

239
00:13:34,460 --> 00:13:36,810
Since you admit that this bead is yours,

240
00:13:36,980 --> 00:13:39,460
you have also admitted that you killed those victims.

241
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:40,900
Nonsense!

242
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:42,780
Bastard, listen carefully.

243
00:13:42,890 --> 00:13:44,620
I did catch those people to test them,

244
00:13:44,620 --> 00:13:46,980
but I let them go after the test. I didn't kill anyone.

245
00:13:47,020 --> 00:13:47,500
I…

246
00:13:47,700 --> 00:13:48,620
Yes, my lord.

247
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:51,180
Didn't you just say there were female corpses?

248
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,500
Our boss only tests men.

249
00:13:53,780 --> 00:13:55,300
She never catches girls.

250
00:13:55,660 --> 00:13:56,220
Yes!

251
00:13:56,260 --> 00:13:57,700
Our boss is so bad at martial arts.

252
00:13:57,740 --> 00:13:59,780
How could she be able to turn people into mummies?

253
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:08,260
I see.

254
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:10,620
You, she-devil,

255
00:14:10,620 --> 00:14:12,300
are really something.

256
00:14:12,530 --> 00:14:15,020
You released those people in public.

257
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:17,060
Then you followed them

258
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:18,780
and killed them all.

259
00:14:19,060 --> 00:14:21,940
As for why you killed these girls,

260
00:14:22,260 --> 00:14:24,060
it was just to misdirect and confuse us

261
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:25,570
and confuse us.

262
00:14:26,380 --> 00:14:29,300
As for how you turned them into mummies…

263
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:32,380
I'll take you back for interrogation.

264
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:33,700
My lord,

265
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,220
there must be something wrong.

266
00:14:35,580 --> 00:14:37,660
A bead alone can't prove anything.

267
00:14:38,060 --> 00:14:41,020
My deduction is tight

268
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,460
and flawless.

269
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,380
Are you questioning my judgment?

270
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:47,420
I didn't mean that.

271
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:49,460
That would be the best.

272
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:51,100
From now on,

273
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:54,300
if anyone dares to stop me from handling the case,

274
00:14:54,620 --> 00:14:56,660
From now on, anyone who dares stop me will be treated as accomplices.

275
00:15:03,140 --> 00:15:03,820
Wait.

276
00:15:06,020 --> 00:15:07,340
This case has nothing to do with the Tang Sect.

277
00:15:07,980 --> 00:15:10,380
I'm  innocent and I'm not afraid of the inquiry.

278
00:15:10,860 --> 00:15:12,010
I'll come with you.

279
00:15:12,850 --> 00:15:13,490
Yan.

280
00:15:13,820 --> 00:15:14,460
Senior Sister.

281
00:15:16,010 --> 00:15:17,060
I don't believe

282
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:19,900
you can convict me, you big fool.

283
00:15:20,100 --> 00:15:20,820
Out of the way.

284
00:15:21,380 --> 00:15:22,020
This…

285
00:15:22,100 --> 00:15:23,220
Why is she so arrogant?

286
00:15:23,580 --> 00:15:24,220
Take her away.

287
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:41,140
Senior Sister.

288
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:42,460
You came at the right time.

289
00:15:42,700 --> 00:15:43,900
Let's get Yan out.

290
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:44,660
Senior!

291
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:45,620
What's wrong?

292
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,580
I'm afraid it's not that simple.

293
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:50,180
Look. Rumor has it that

294
00:15:48,380 --> 00:15:51,370
[Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain practise occult arts and have turned bloodthirsty Li Chengxi and Yun Gaixue]

295
00:15:50,300 --> 00:15:52,100
The Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain have evil power.

296
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,010
They are bloodthirsty.

297
00:15:53,180 --> 00:15:54,690
If they come off the mountain, there will be bloodshed.

298
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:57,140
Who would have thought that Li Han and Li Yan

299
00:15:57,140 --> 00:15:58,580
are the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

300
00:15:58,980 --> 00:15:59,500
Senior Sister.

301
00:15:59,980 --> 00:16:00,980
Could they be the ones

302
00:16:01,210 --> 00:16:02,620
who committed the mummies' case?

303
00:16:07,020 --> 00:16:07,820
Where are you going?

304
00:16:09,410 --> 00:16:10,060
To rescue them.

305
00:16:10,940 --> 00:16:11,700
Rescue?

306
00:16:14,180 --> 00:16:15,220
I'm right here.

307
00:16:15,260 --> 00:16:16,130
Who are you going to rescue?

308
00:16:19,340 --> 00:16:21,260
You are going to save that ugly monster, right?

309
00:16:21,900 --> 00:16:22,300
Yes.

310
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:23,460
Yes？

311
00:16:23,660 --> 00:16:25,580
To practice the Book of Yueque, one can absorb other people's powers.

312
00:16:26,060 --> 00:16:27,380
If Tang Buyan is the murderer,

313
00:16:27,690 --> 00:16:28,700
we can take this opportunity

314
00:16:28,700 --> 00:16:29,780
to make her hand over the Book of Yueque.

315
00:16:30,140 --> 00:16:30,850
Fine.

316
00:16:31,140 --> 00:16:31,860
We can save her first.

317
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:33,340
After we get the book,

318
00:16:33,770 --> 00:16:35,020
then we can kill her.

319
00:16:48,580 --> 00:16:49,380
Cheers.

320
00:16:52,260 --> 00:16:54,020
Didn't Know-It-All say he would interrogate me?

321
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:55,380
Why is he just locking me up?

322
00:16:55,540 --> 00:16:56,490
You are indeed young.

323
00:16:56,660 --> 00:16:59,140
Have you ever heard of him investigating someone?

324
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,700
Know-It-All.

325
00:17:00,780 --> 00:17:02,100
He will know everything without interrogation.

326
00:17:10,140 --> 00:17:10,859
Li Han. Li Yan.

327
00:17:11,140 --> 00:17:12,050
You came to save me?

328
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:13,730
Great!

329
00:17:13,900 --> 00:17:15,260
I'll raise your salary when we get back.

330
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:24,660
You wish!

331
00:17:25,020 --> 00:17:26,420
Do you really think we're here to save you?

332
00:17:27,619 --> 00:17:29,580
We're here for your Book of Yueque.

333
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,740
Tell me, where is the Book of Yueque?

334
00:17:31,940 --> 00:17:32,980
Hand it over now.

335
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:34,330
We'll take you out.

336
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:36,580
What the hell is the Book of Yueque?

337
00:17:37,220 --> 00:17:38,220
Forget it.

338
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:40,900
Looks like they think I have that book.

339
00:17:41,380 --> 00:17:43,420
Anyway, let's get out first.

340
00:17:44,180 --> 00:17:44,980
Okay.

341
00:17:45,460 --> 00:17:47,420
I can give it to you.

342
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:50,820
I've just been accused of murder.

343
00:17:51,060 --> 00:17:52,660
You have to clear my name.

344
00:17:52,860 --> 00:17:53,660
And I can give that book to you.

345
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:55,300
Aren't you the murderer?

346
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:57,180
Murder is illegal, okay?

347
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:58,420
I'm just a civilian.

348
00:17:58,420 --> 00:17:59,420
How could I do

349
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:00,540
such a crazy thing?

350
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:04,620
If you didn't kill them,

351
00:18:05,380 --> 00:18:06,380
among your Tang Sect,

352
00:18:06,540 --> 00:18:08,140
who has ever practiced the Book of Yueque?

353
00:18:08,500 --> 00:18:09,900
No one.

354
00:18:10,660 --> 00:18:12,100
How can just anyone

355
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:14,700
practice our secret martial arts?

356
00:18:15,140 --> 00:18:16,820
Then is there anyone else

357
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,780
who can access such a unique secret book?

358
00:18:20,140 --> 00:18:22,420
It is strictly guarded

359
00:18:22,420 --> 00:18:23,860
by the higher-ranking  disciples of our Tang Sect.

360
00:18:25,220 --> 00:18:27,020
Just tell me whether you'll save me or not.

361
00:18:30,860 --> 00:18:31,420
Let's go.

362
00:18:31,500 --> 00:18:33,810
[Prison]

363
00:18:34,460 --> 00:18:35,420
You mean

364
00:18:36,060 --> 00:18:38,540
the two new guards of your Tang Sect

365
00:18:38,820 --> 00:18:41,460
are the legendary Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain?

366
00:18:41,980 --> 00:18:43,100
And now

367
00:18:43,580 --> 00:18:44,900
both of them are missing.

368
00:18:45,060 --> 00:18:45,770
Exactly.

369
00:18:46,380 --> 00:18:48,090
This case has nothing to do with our Tang Sect.

370
00:18:48,380 --> 00:18:50,100
Please clear our name.

371
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,300
I see.

372
00:19:01,860 --> 00:19:02,860
I knew it.

373
00:19:03,140 --> 00:19:05,940
There was a part that couldn't be explained clearly.

374
00:19:06,180 --> 00:19:07,820
Turns out the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain

375
00:19:07,940 --> 00:19:09,330
came to our town.

376
00:19:10,260 --> 00:19:11,580
The time they appeared

377
00:19:11,860 --> 00:19:14,340
was also the time we found the mummies.

378
00:19:14,660 --> 00:19:17,020
They went to your Tang Sect under cover

379
00:19:17,300 --> 00:19:20,020
just to frame Tang Buyan.

380
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:21,420
In this way,

381
00:19:21,420 --> 00:19:24,050
time, location, characters, and motive

382
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:26,900
are all linked to each other.

383
00:19:27,980 --> 00:19:29,340
The case can be closed now.

384
00:19:29,620 --> 00:19:30,660
They are the culprits.

385
00:19:31,140 --> 00:19:32,010
My lord, you are so wise.

386
00:19:32,260 --> 00:19:33,020
Then can you

387
00:19:33,020 --> 00:19:34,140
release my little sister?

388
00:19:34,500 --> 00:19:35,660
Don't worry. I'll...

389
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,220
Report!

390
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:38,530
My lord, bad news!

391
00:19:38,740 --> 00:19:39,810
There were two people who broke into the prison

392
00:19:39,810 --> 00:19:41,050
and saved Tang Buyan.

393
00:19:41,580 --> 00:19:43,660
How... This has nothing to do with Yan.

394
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:44,860
Don't panic.

395
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:48,870
[Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain practise occult arts and have turned bloodthirsty Li Chengxi and Yun Gaixue]

396
00:19:47,540 --> 00:19:48,900
Is it these two?

397
00:19:50,090 --> 00:19:51,660
Yes, they are the ones who broke into the prison.

398
00:19:53,500 --> 00:19:56,100
Everything is under my control.

399
00:19:56,780 --> 00:19:59,500
They didn't break into the prison to save Tang Buyan,

400
00:19:59,770 --> 00:20:02,380
but because you found out their real identity.

401
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:05,580
So they kidnapped Tang Buyan to threaten you

402
00:20:05,860 --> 00:20:09,540
and staged her escape from prison.

403
00:20:10,290 --> 00:20:13,860
My lord, you're so perceptive.

404
00:20:14,340 --> 00:20:15,580
Your judgment is like God.

405
00:20:16,420 --> 00:20:17,420
Of course.

406
00:20:17,620 --> 00:20:19,460
Otherwise, how can they call me "Know-It-All"?

407
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:21,460
Gather people

408
00:20:21,820 --> 00:20:24,060
to capture the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain as soon as possible.

409
00:20:24,340 --> 00:20:24,900
Yes!

410
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,340
Don't worry.

411
00:20:56,900 --> 00:20:58,380
Why are we here?

412
00:20:58,860 --> 00:21:00,090
Aren't you going to clear your name?

413
00:21:00,900 --> 00:21:02,460
Of course, you have to start by investigating the body.

414
00:21:02,780 --> 00:21:03,890
Is that so?

415
00:21:19,900 --> 00:21:21,060
Look at you.

416
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:22,260
Shivering like a rat.

417
00:21:26,660 --> 00:21:27,980
You're even afraid of rats.

418
00:21:28,250 --> 00:21:29,260
You're more timid.

419
00:21:29,660 --> 00:21:31,500
That was because I hadn't paid attention just now.

420
00:21:31,820 --> 00:21:33,820
Then I was also just pretending.

421
00:21:34,020 --> 00:21:35,540
If you two are both afraid,

422
00:21:35,780 --> 00:21:36,890
you can go to the door and guard it.

423
00:21:47,140 --> 00:21:48,100
Judging from the state of these bodies,

424
00:21:48,620 --> 00:21:49,940
it's true that their power has been drained.

425
00:21:56,780 --> 00:21:58,330
And it's true that all of them have a teardrop mole on their face.

426
00:22:00,100 --> 00:22:02,420
Why did the culprit only target the people I tested?

427
00:22:02,860 --> 00:22:04,780
Did he have any grudge against me?

428
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:07,370
Stop it.

429
00:22:09,250 --> 00:22:11,900
Li Han! Ghost! Ghost!

430
00:22:19,860 --> 00:22:20,580
Ghost!

431
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:24,100
You're so timid, you ugly monster.

432
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:26,540
Tang Buyan.

433
00:22:26,940 --> 00:22:28,140
How dare you hold my brother!

434
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:28,860
Let go of him!

435
00:22:31,300 --> 00:22:32,060
Li Yan!

436
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:34,660
People can be scarred to death, you know!

437
00:22:34,780 --> 00:22:35,700
When I return to the Tang Sect,

438
00:22:36,020 --> 00:22:37,300
I'll deduct your salary.

439
00:22:38,500 --> 00:22:39,780
How dare you threaten me?

440
00:22:40,100 --> 00:22:41,100
I'll kill you!

441
00:22:41,100 --> 00:22:41,780
Wait.

442
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:43,900
Someone's here.

443
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,860
You… Wait for me.

444
00:22:46,140 --> 00:22:46,700
Hurry!

445
00:22:50,340 --> 00:22:52,300
Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain!

446
00:22:52,660 --> 00:22:54,860
How dare you commit a crime in my prefecture?

447
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:57,420
What's going on?

448
00:22:57,700 --> 00:22:59,660
You have just accused me of murder.

449
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:02,060
Now you say my two guards are the murderers.

450
00:23:02,500 --> 00:23:04,860
And they are the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

451
00:23:05,220 --> 00:23:07,180
Can you be more ridiculous?

452
00:23:08,140 --> 00:23:09,740
I wronged you. I was wrong.

453
00:23:10,010 --> 00:23:10,660
Yan.

454
00:23:11,220 --> 00:23:12,660
They are really the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

455
00:23:12,900 --> 00:23:13,570
Come to me!

456
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:14,340
Hurry up!

457
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:14,860
Hurry!

458
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:16,540
You want to leave?

459
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,620
Let her go.

460
00:23:17,860 --> 00:23:19,620
Why should I listen to you?

461
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,620
I won't.

462
00:23:20,980 --> 00:23:21,980
Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain!

463
00:23:22,740 --> 00:23:24,260
How dare you!

464
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:26,380
You killed people with a mole of a teardrop on their face

465
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:27,660
and framed Tang Buyan.

466
00:23:28,060 --> 00:23:29,130
I've found out

467
00:23:29,130 --> 00:23:30,700
what happened to the case.

468
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,740
Crystal clear.

469
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:33,060
Surrender now!

470
00:23:34,660 --> 00:23:35,980
What do you want?

471
00:23:36,380 --> 00:23:37,180
Nonsense!

472
00:23:38,570 --> 00:23:40,690
I, Yun Gaixue, have always killed people openly.

473
00:23:40,780 --> 00:23:42,500
Framing some losers

474
00:23:42,860 --> 00:23:44,820
is not my style as a big devil.

475
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:45,700
Fine.

476
00:23:46,770 --> 00:23:47,780
Since you've admitted it.

477
00:23:48,340 --> 00:23:48,890
Li Chengxi.

478
00:23:49,420 --> 00:23:50,570
Since your brother has admitted it,

479
00:23:51,260 --> 00:23:52,220
your cover is blown too.

480
00:23:52,620 --> 00:23:55,660
You really are the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain?

481
00:23:56,140 --> 00:23:58,020
We are from Xuanqi Mountain.

482
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:00,140
But we didn't do it.

483
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:02,330
Brother, stop talking to him.

484
00:24:02,500 --> 00:24:03,340
Just kill them all.

485
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:04,940
Arrest them!

486
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:05,980
Yes!

487
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:07,500
Senior Sister.

488
00:24:07,500 --> 00:24:07,940
Yan.

489
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:14,580
Young Master!

490
00:24:23,260 --> 00:24:23,980
Help!
