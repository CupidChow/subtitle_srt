[Hello There]

[Episode 7]

4
00:00:53,620 --> 00:00:54,460
What?

5
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:56,140
I have to pull weeds

6
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,260
for these black radishes?

7
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:05,459
Fine. I'll do it.

8
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:08,820
I definitely won't need your help this time.

9
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:39,460
Watch out!

10
00:01:49,460 --> 00:01:50,580
I didn't fall.

11
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:54,940
Li Chengxi.

12
00:01:55,539 --> 00:01:57,340
Why are you lying on the floor?

13
00:01:58,580 --> 00:01:59,370
I'll be kind.

14
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:00,620
Let me help you.

15
00:02:02,930 --> 00:02:03,500
Here.

16
00:02:27,620 --> 00:02:29,410
I'm really tired today.

17
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,579
Then have a good rest.

18
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:36,060
We'll talk about the rest tomorrow.

19
00:02:41,020 --> 00:02:41,610
All right.

20
00:02:52,329 --> 00:02:53,660
The starry sky is so beautiful.

21
00:03:05,740 --> 00:03:07,500
Sitting quietly like this,

22
00:03:07,740 --> 00:03:09,580
it feels so great to be carefree.

23
00:03:14,420 --> 00:03:17,060
If you like it, then be it.

24
00:03:18,660 --> 00:03:19,820
It's not that easy.

25
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:21,730
I still have a blood vessel issue to solve.

26
00:03:26,820 --> 00:03:28,300
Let's forget it.

27
00:03:29,100 --> 00:03:30,340
I'll seize every happy day while I can.

28
00:03:31,900 --> 00:03:32,740
Li Chengxi,

29
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,540
leave me a room in Xuanqi Mountain.

30
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,579
Okay.

31
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:57,460
I'll leave you a room.

32
00:03:58,579 --> 00:04:00,500
You're really a good friend. Very good.

33
00:04:18,899 --> 00:04:19,660
Morning.

34
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:21,940
I slept so well last night.

35
00:04:22,420 --> 00:04:23,460
You slept well?

36
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:24,940
I think you were just exhausted

37
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:25,850
and passed out.

38
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,420
My brother is famous for

39
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:29,020
his strict supervision in Xuanqi Mountain.

40
00:04:29,260 --> 00:04:30,220
You must have been tortured hard

41
00:04:30,220 --> 00:04:31,340
by my brother yesterday.

42
00:04:31,730 --> 00:04:33,580
No. Yesterday your brother...

43
00:04:33,580 --> 00:04:35,500
Young Master!

44
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:36,620
Bad news!

45
00:04:36,740 --> 00:04:37,900
The formation down the mountain was broken.

46
00:04:38,060 --> 00:04:39,540
A dozen of martial artists broke in.

47
00:04:39,740 --> 00:04:41,659
They were shouting and want us to hand over the Wushan.

48
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:42,580
What?

49
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,420
They came so soon.

50
00:04:44,860 --> 00:04:46,580
How dare they break into my mountain?

51
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,620
Their heads can be offerings to worship my sword.

52
00:04:48,700 --> 00:04:49,260
Wait.

53
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:50,850
Don't act rashly.

54
00:04:51,380 --> 00:04:52,460
Let's take a look first.

55
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,180
What a stupid maze!

56
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,530
It made us a mess!

57
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:02,500
I must get the Wushan today!

58
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:03,820
Yes.

59
00:05:03,980 --> 00:05:05,570
The Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain harm the martial arts circle

60
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:06,500
and monopolize the Wushan.

61
00:05:06,660 --> 00:05:07,860
Everyone wants them to be executed.

62
00:05:07,940 --> 00:05:08,820
Brothers, let's go!

63
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:10,060
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

64
00:05:10,340 --> 00:05:11,620
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

65
00:05:11,740 --> 00:05:12,860
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

66
00:05:12,940 --> 00:05:14,140
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

67
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:15,500
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

68
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:16,900
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

69
00:05:17,060 --> 00:05:18,260
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

70
00:05:18,340 --> 00:05:19,500
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

71
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:20,740
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

72
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:21,980
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

73
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:23,260
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

74
00:05:23,660 --> 00:05:24,660
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

75
00:05:25,060 --> 00:05:26,180
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

76
00:05:26,420 --> 00:05:27,340
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

77
00:05:27,460 --> 00:05:28,420
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

78
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:29,860
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

79
00:05:30,060 --> 00:05:31,140
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

80
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:32,500
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

81
00:05:32,659 --> 00:05:33,930
Crush Xuanqi Mountain!

82
00:05:47,420 --> 00:05:49,020
Looks like it's getting interesting.

83
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:52,460
Who was shouting about crushing Xuanqi Mountain?

84
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:54,060
Come out if you dare!

85
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:55,460
Fine.

86
00:06:01,300 --> 00:06:02,540
It's you!

87
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:06,660
I'll chop you into minced meat.

88
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:09,180
Why are you stopping me?

89
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:10,540
They are already at our door.

90
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:11,340
Let's kill them!

91
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:13,780
Everyone,

92
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:16,170
you are just here for the Wushan.

93
00:06:16,860 --> 00:06:17,740
I'll give them to you.

94
00:06:23,100 --> 00:06:23,820
Are those the Wushan?

95
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,540
You just give them what they want?

96
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,610
What about my dignity?

97
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:31,180
Wushan is not rare.

98
00:06:31,930 --> 00:06:33,140
It only works to suppress

99
00:06:33,140 --> 00:06:34,140
my brother's demonic energy.

100
00:06:35,100 --> 00:06:36,060
If you want,

101
00:06:36,380 --> 00:06:37,180
just take them.

102
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:39,020
But after that,

103
00:06:39,180 --> 00:06:40,260
you must leave immediately.

104
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:42,020
Don't cause any more trouble.

105
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:43,220
Otherwise,

106
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,980
don't blame me for being rude.

107
00:06:46,300 --> 00:06:47,290
The two of them

108
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:48,820
are good at acting.

109
00:06:49,100 --> 00:06:51,020
Even I would believe these were the real Wushan.

110
00:06:51,180 --> 00:06:51,980
What?

111
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:53,740
Wushan is an extraordinary medicine

112
00:06:53,820 --> 00:06:54,780
and is extremely rare.

113
00:06:55,020 --> 00:06:55,690
How could it be possible to

114
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:57,340
get a basket of it so easily?

115
00:06:57,500 --> 00:06:58,610
They must be lying.

116
00:06:58,780 --> 00:06:59,700
Hand over the real Wushan.

117
00:07:00,020 --> 00:07:01,100
Hand over the real Wushan.

118
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:02,410
Hand over the real Wushan.

119
00:07:02,780 --> 00:07:03,860
Hand over the real Wushan.

120
00:07:04,180 --> 00:07:05,340
Hand over the real Wushan.

121
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:07,300
You're right.

122
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:09,060
Wushan is indeed rare.

123
00:07:09,300 --> 00:07:11,180
But if you get the Wushan,

124
00:07:11,420 --> 00:07:12,290
how will you divide them?

125
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,290
Don't listen to her nonsense.

126
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:18,100
Let's get the real Wushan first.

127
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:18,900
Look.

128
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:20,580
Why are you getting so impatient?

129
00:07:21,220 --> 00:07:22,820
You look guilty.

130
00:07:22,980 --> 00:07:24,500
Are you trying to

131
00:07:24,580 --> 00:07:25,660
to have the Wushan all to yourself?

132
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:27,980
Cut the crap. Just kill them.

133
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,700
This is interesting.

134
00:07:58,820 --> 00:07:59,540
Look.

135
00:07:59,659 --> 00:08:00,900
The great devil is killing people.

136
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:02,780
Guys, let's go together.

137
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:04,900
Kill the great devil and eliminate the hazard of the martial arts circle.

138
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:34,940
Who are you? You can actually stabilize my brother.

139
00:08:41,610 --> 00:08:43,659
Physician Yan, it's you.

140
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:44,820
Miss Tang.

141
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:47,020
Long time no see.

142
00:08:48,820 --> 00:08:49,940
Your disease

143
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:53,370
hasn't recovered at all.

144
00:08:56,460 --> 00:08:59,140
If you can't cure it,

145
00:08:59,420 --> 00:09:01,900
then other physicians can't cure it too.

146
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:04,730
Li Chengxi.

147
00:09:04,980 --> 00:09:06,660
This is Yan Ran, a miraculous physician,

148
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:09,060
also known as Yanwang Chou.

149
00:09:09,380 --> 00:09:11,010
He has excellent medical skills.

150
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:13,620
If he ranks second in the world,

151
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:14,860
no one dares to be number one.

152
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:20,380
Well,

153
00:09:24,220 --> 00:09:27,340
don't be fooled by Physician Yan's appearance.

154
00:09:27,940 --> 00:09:29,420
Since he's a strange doctor,

155
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,820
he has to be extraordinary.

156
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,540
As long as his medical skills are good.

157
00:09:33,820 --> 00:09:34,770
We only need his medical skills to be good.

158
00:09:42,180 --> 00:09:42,700
Guys,

159
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:44,180
let's attack together

160
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:45,380
now that Yun Gaixue can't move.

161
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:46,260
Wait.

162
00:09:46,580 --> 00:09:48,260
You always ask us to do it.

163
00:09:48,700 --> 00:09:49,740
Why don't you do it yourself?

164
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,860
I'm giving you the chance

165
00:09:51,860 --> 00:09:52,740
to make a great achievement.

166
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:53,820
We don't need it.

167
00:09:58,940 --> 00:10:01,300
I didn't expect all heroes

168
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:02,980
to be here.

169
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,580
Who is this?

170
00:10:16,180 --> 00:10:16,980
Do you know him?

171
00:10:17,380 --> 00:10:18,420
Li Chengtian.

172
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:22,180
Why did he turn his back to us after he showed up?

173
00:10:22,660 --> 00:10:23,900
He must be a master.

174
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,700
Masters all look like this when they show up.

175
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:32,180
Isn't he

176
00:10:32,570 --> 00:10:33,980
Master Li Chengtian,

177
00:10:33,980 --> 00:10:36,180
the chief of Lingjue Sect, the world's strongest sect?

178
00:10:36,460 --> 00:10:37,500
Why is he here?

179
00:10:37,860 --> 00:10:39,900
Chief Li also wants the Wushan?

180
00:10:42,620 --> 00:10:44,100
Don't get me wrong.

181
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:46,620
I'm not here for the Wushan,

182
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:48,620
but to persuade

183
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:51,620
my two nephews to turn over a new leaf.

184
00:10:52,780 --> 00:10:53,860
We have nothing to do

185
00:10:54,340 --> 00:10:55,860
with Lingjue Sect.

186
00:10:56,380 --> 00:10:58,460
Xi'er, I know

187
00:10:58,660 --> 00:11:00,340
you've been holding grudges

188
00:11:00,340 --> 00:11:01,770
for I taught you ancestral skills.

189
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:04,060
But I only did that to teach you martial arts

190
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:05,770
and help you grow up soon.

191
00:11:06,410 --> 00:11:07,740
You betrayed Lingjue Sect.

192
00:11:08,060 --> 00:11:10,380
Do you know how sad I am?

193
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:12,220
What happened?

194
00:11:13,130 --> 00:11:14,220
Don't you understand?

195
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:19,300
The Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain had ancestral skills passed down to them,

196
00:11:19,650 --> 00:11:20,620
yet they are unhappy about it.

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,020
In the end, they betrayed Lingjue Sect.

198
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,940
How ungrateful.

199
00:11:31,580 --> 00:11:32,740
My confidant.

200
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:36,580
Thank you.

201
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:43,700
But now you've become possessed by demons while practicing martial arts,

202
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,100
and are despised by all martial artists.

203
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,850
Today, I must

204
00:11:48,850 --> 00:11:50,700
take you back and discipline you strictly.

205
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:52,140
I can't let you harm the martial arts circle anymore.

206
00:11:52,220 --> 00:11:52,700
Right?

207
00:11:52,850 --> 00:11:53,780
-Yes. -Yes.

208
00:11:53,860 --> 00:11:55,100
Shut up, mister.

209
00:11:55,900 --> 00:11:58,060
Where did you come from?

210
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:00,300
When did you see them harming the martial arts circle?

211
00:12:00,580 --> 00:12:01,890
Obviously it's these people

212
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:03,100
who came here to robb the Wushan.

213
00:12:03,260 --> 00:12:05,420
Even if they are here to rob,

214
00:12:06,140 --> 00:12:07,940
you shouldn't kill them.

215
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:08,860
What do you mean?

216
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:10,460
You came up to rob the Wushan.

217
00:12:10,540 --> 00:12:11,770
But we have to welcome you

218
00:12:11,770 --> 00:12:12,940
with open arms?

219
00:12:13,450 --> 00:12:14,580
According to this logic,

220
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:17,300
I'll take some people to Lingjue Sect tomorrow.

221
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,260
Chief Li, please welcome us with open arms

222
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:20,540
and let us rob you.

223
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:23,100
Ridiculous! Ridiculous!

224
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,010
You can make up stories,

225
00:12:25,010 --> 00:12:26,500
and I can't be unreasonable?

226
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,740
You martial artists

227
00:12:28,820 --> 00:12:29,940
speak of benevolence and morality all day,

228
00:12:29,980 --> 00:12:31,340
but in fact, you're full of bad ideas.

229
00:12:32,060 --> 00:12:33,940
Although Li Chengxi is cursed by you,

230
00:12:34,250 --> 00:12:35,180
I believe

231
00:12:35,490 --> 00:12:37,860
he is not a person

232
00:12:37,900 --> 00:12:39,180
who would betray his sect.

233
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:41,300
There must have been some problems with your Lingjue Sect.

234
00:12:41,420 --> 00:12:41,820
You...

235
00:12:41,820 --> 00:12:42,450
Enough.

236
00:12:43,490 --> 00:12:45,100
It's more important to treat Xue now.

237
00:12:46,140 --> 00:12:46,980
I'll say it again.

238
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,780
If someone makes trouble again,

239
00:12:56,860 --> 00:12:58,140
he'll be just like this tree.

240
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:12,420
You're so stubborn.

241
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:20,820
Guys, let's stay on Xuanqi Mountain.

242
00:13:20,890 --> 00:13:22,340
I don't believe we can't get the real Wushan.

243
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:22,860
Right?

244
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,180
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain.

245
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:26,700
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain.

246
00:13:26,820 --> 00:13:28,140
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain.

247
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:28,820
Brother,

248
00:13:29,980 --> 00:13:32,660
we can't defeat the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

249
00:13:32,980 --> 00:13:35,220
Can we get the Wushan if we stay here?

250
00:13:36,060 --> 00:13:37,180
If we can't get the Wushan in the hard way,

251
00:13:37,660 --> 00:13:39,380
we can use some tactics.

252
00:13:39,740 --> 00:13:41,490
When the dark night comes...

253
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:43,220
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain.

254
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:44,780
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain.

255
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:45,700
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain.

256
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:46,780
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain!

257
00:13:47,420 --> 00:13:49,540
Stay on Xuanqi Mountain!

258
00:13:52,940 --> 00:13:55,020
You were hit just now. Are you okay?

259
00:13:56,500 --> 00:13:57,300
I'm fine.

260
00:14:00,860 --> 00:14:01,540
Don't worry.

261
00:14:01,620 --> 00:14:02,660
With Physician Yan here,

262
00:14:02,780 --> 00:14:04,340
Yun Gaixue will be fine.

263
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:05,940
When Xue was possessed before,

264
00:14:06,340 --> 00:14:09,060
he can be suppressed by icy martial skills and Wushan.

265
00:14:09,700 --> 00:14:11,260
I didn't expect it to be so serious this time.

266
00:14:13,380 --> 00:14:15,340
Yun Gaixue is possessed.

267
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:20,940
Chief,

268
00:14:21,100 --> 00:14:22,580
Young Master and Shadow have started

269
00:14:22,580 --> 00:14:23,780
to practice Book of Xincan.

270
00:14:23,980 --> 00:14:25,500
But they are brothers after all.

271
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,100
I'm worried that when Young Master turns 18,

272
00:14:28,660 --> 00:14:30,460
he won't absorb Shadow's power.

273
00:14:31,220 --> 00:14:32,860
This is the fate of twins.

274
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:34,180
No one can disobey it.

275
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,140
Even if Xi and Xue disagree,

276
00:14:39,060 --> 00:14:41,940
we must do everything to force them to finish it.

277
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:43,380
Yes.

278
00:14:45,780 --> 00:14:46,540
Keep quiet.

279
00:14:57,300 --> 00:14:58,860
On the 18th birthday,

280
00:14:57,990 --> 00:15:00,770
[Lingjue Sect]

281
00:14:59,500 --> 00:15:01,130
I didn't absorb Xue's power.

282
00:15:01,660 --> 00:15:04,100
So we were both possessed by demons.

283
00:15:04,780 --> 00:15:05,940
In order to get rid of the inner demon,

284
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,420
I started looking for a solution.

285
00:15:10,220 --> 00:15:12,460
I didn't expect that the two of them

286
00:15:12,460 --> 00:15:13,740
suffered so much in the past.

287
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,580
If it weren't for the Book of Xincan in Lingjue Sect,

288
00:15:17,580 --> 00:15:19,740
they would have grown up healthily

289
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:21,420
like normal kids.

290
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:25,860
Does the Book of Yueque work?

291
00:15:26,180 --> 00:15:27,300
Have you started practicing?

292
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,890
I'm practicing it.

293
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:31,300
But I'm not sure if it'll work,

294
00:15:31,700 --> 00:15:34,180
so I didn't dare to let Xue try.

295
00:15:46,020 --> 00:15:46,740
Physician Yan.

296
00:15:50,980 --> 00:15:53,020
Physician Yan, how is Xue?

297
00:15:54,620 --> 00:15:56,340
Don't worry. He's fine.

298
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:58,060
I told you.

299
00:15:58,140 --> 00:16:00,980
With Physician Yan, Yun Gaixue will be fine.

300
00:16:01,940 --> 00:16:02,940
He is possessed by demons.

301
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,180
His meridians are blocked.

302
00:16:04,340 --> 00:16:06,420
He only has a few months to live.

303
00:16:07,580 --> 00:16:09,010
You just said he was fine.

304
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:09,780
Yes.

305
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:11,620
His disease is fine.

306
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:14,100
I've been a physician for so many years.

307
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:15,420
This is the first time

308
00:16:15,460 --> 00:16:16,700
I've met such a challenging disease.

309
00:16:16,940 --> 00:16:19,460
Is there any cure?

310
00:16:19,700 --> 00:16:21,820
The meridians are blocked. How can we cure them?

311
00:16:22,220 --> 00:16:24,580
You should start preparing for the funeral.

312
00:16:31,660 --> 00:16:33,540
If you met an ordinary physician,

313
00:16:33,740 --> 00:16:35,020
he would say that.

314
00:16:35,460 --> 00:16:36,860
But you are lucky

315
00:16:37,220 --> 00:16:38,820
to meet me.

316
00:16:39,580 --> 00:16:42,420
I will never send him to hell.

317
00:16:43,940 --> 00:16:46,780
Can't you finish your words at once?

318
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:48,780
We were so worried.

319
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:52,220
By the way,

320
00:16:52,620 --> 00:16:53,500
show me Wushan.

321
00:16:53,940 --> 00:16:54,500
Yes.

322
00:16:55,740 --> 00:16:56,900
This is the Wushan.

323
00:16:58,610 --> 00:16:59,700
This ugly thing

324
00:16:59,780 --> 00:17:01,340
is really the Wushan.

325
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,859
So you weren't acting just now?

326
00:17:08,290 --> 00:17:09,380
I knew it.

327
00:17:09,660 --> 00:17:12,260
How could Yun Gaixue be so good at acting?

328
00:17:12,380 --> 00:17:13,619
It does work.

329
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,060
But it's not mature yet.

330
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:16,940
A basket of trash.

331
00:17:17,329 --> 00:17:18,660
This is even more useless to you.

332
00:17:19,220 --> 00:17:20,859
So I came here for nothing.

333
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,300
No, no.

334
00:17:25,579 --> 00:17:27,660
I'm here to help you.

335
00:17:32,340 --> 00:17:32,980
Physician Yan,

336
00:17:33,580 --> 00:17:35,410
I'll go and ripen the Wushan.

337
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:36,780
Get more matured ones.

338
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:38,100
Otherwise, it won't work well.

339
00:17:38,180 --> 00:17:38,700
Okay.

340
00:17:39,020 --> 00:17:40,060
I'll go with you.

341
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:48,650
I tried so hard to give you a chance,

342
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:49,980
but you got nothing.

343
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:51,460
It's my fault.

344
00:17:52,010 --> 00:17:54,020
Li Chengxi has been keeping the Book of Yueque with him.

345
00:17:54,530 --> 00:17:55,820
I can't do it.

346
00:18:00,460 --> 00:18:03,260
It seems I have to think of another way.

347
00:18:18,260 --> 00:18:19,140
Are you okay?

348
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:21,460
I'm fine.

349
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:24,180
Don't worry. I'm here.

350
00:18:25,340 --> 00:18:25,900
Here.

351
00:19:00,020 --> 00:19:02,340
This matured Wushan really has a mind of its own.

352
00:19:14,460 --> 00:19:15,940
Physician Yan, take a look.

353
00:19:16,380 --> 00:19:17,580
Are these enough?

354
00:19:18,020 --> 00:19:18,660
If not,

355
00:19:19,140 --> 00:19:20,380
I can make more.

356
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:25,220
Okay. Put them down here.

357
00:19:25,620 --> 00:19:26,940
I haven't figured out how to cure him.

358
00:19:27,700 --> 00:19:29,860
I heard that the Book of Yueque works.

359
00:19:30,220 --> 00:19:31,100
However,

360
00:19:31,300 --> 00:19:33,500
I'm not sure if I can get rid of the demonic energy.

361
00:19:33,980 --> 00:19:35,340
I've practiced a part of it.

362
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:38,460
But I haven't figured out the last move.

363
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,380
The last move?

364
00:19:43,580 --> 00:19:44,890
[Secret of Kungfu]

365
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:51,540
Only the one you fall in love with

366
00:19:52,340 --> 00:19:54,900
can help you practice this skill.

367
00:19:59,980 --> 00:20:01,100
Give me your hand.

368
00:20:07,660 --> 00:20:10,490
I can't feel anything with your pulse.

369
00:20:12,180 --> 00:20:14,260
When do you usually get possessed?

370
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:16,140
The property of my martial skills

371
00:20:16,340 --> 00:20:17,700
helps me to control the demonic energy more easily.

372
00:20:18,780 --> 00:20:20,940
It nearly broke out several times.

373
00:20:21,460 --> 00:20:22,690
It seems that

374
00:20:24,940 --> 00:20:26,780
they all have something to do with

375
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:30,460
being in close physical contact with Miss Tang.

376
00:20:36,620 --> 00:20:38,500
I didn't expect you to be such a pervert.

377
00:20:39,740 --> 00:20:41,660
Do you get possessed

378
00:20:42,450 --> 00:20:43,490
when touching other women too?

379
00:20:45,620 --> 00:20:48,980
I've never had close contact with other women.

380
00:20:50,460 --> 00:20:51,540
So,

381
00:20:52,580 --> 00:20:54,500
you're easily possessed

382
00:20:55,860 --> 00:20:56,900
once you have close contact with women.

383
00:20:57,740 --> 00:20:58,660
That's easy.

384
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:01,060
Just find a random woman and try it.

385
00:21:05,740 --> 00:21:08,290
Are you still...

386
00:21:15,780 --> 00:21:18,900
I didn't expect the chief of Xuanqi Mountain

387
00:21:19,420 --> 00:21:20,900
to still be a virgin.

388
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,020
If you don't have a suitable candidate,

389
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:26,620
why don't you go to the brothel in the city?

390
00:21:27,460 --> 00:21:28,100
That's not necessary.

391
00:21:30,460 --> 00:21:31,140
Sugar cake.

392
00:21:31,940 --> 00:21:34,260
Don't take my sugar cake. Stop there.

393
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:35,700
This guy...

394
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:37,660
is he the reincarnation of a starving ghost?

395
00:21:37,930 --> 00:21:39,660
He doesn't forget to eat even when he's sick.

396
00:21:42,860 --> 00:21:45,140
What? Why are you hesitating?

397
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:46,740
Don't you want to cure your brother?

398
00:21:50,420 --> 00:21:51,140
Physician Yan,

399
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,900
I'll leave Xue to you.

400
00:21:54,900 --> 00:21:55,570
I...

401
00:21:57,140 --> 00:21:58,020
I'll try it.

402
00:21:58,580 --> 00:21:59,060
By the way,

403
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:01,660
remember to try a few more times

404
00:22:02,290 --> 00:22:03,620
to ensure your success.

405
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:18,490
You mean

406
00:22:19,420 --> 00:22:21,180
you want to test the demonic energy

407
00:22:21,180 --> 00:22:22,380
through intimate contact with me?

408
00:22:23,060 --> 00:22:25,060
Physician Yan said so.

409
00:22:25,860 --> 00:22:27,500
If you feel uncomfortable,

410
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:29,180
you can reject it.

411
00:22:30,860 --> 00:22:31,500
It's okay.

412
00:22:31,940 --> 00:22:34,250
It's for curing your demonic energy anyway.

413
00:22:34,660 --> 00:22:36,820
You helped me a lot in the Tang Sect.

414
00:22:37,100 --> 00:22:38,500
I should help you.

415
00:22:39,620 --> 00:22:40,300
But

416
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:41,860
what should I do?

417
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,580
Like this?

418
00:23:03,300 --> 00:23:03,860
You...

419
00:23:05,460 --> 00:23:07,340
can you let go of me first?

420
00:23:08,420 --> 00:23:09,140
What's wrong?

421
00:23:14,060 --> 00:23:15,820
Is this not close enough?

422
00:23:17,330 --> 00:23:19,340
What else should we try?

423
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:21,420
The Book of Yueque is about martial skills.

424
00:23:21,940 --> 00:23:23,980
Why don't we practice it together?

425
00:23:24,620 --> 00:23:25,340
Practice?

426
00:23:26,980 --> 00:23:27,740
How?

427
00:23:28,820 --> 00:23:29,860
Watch me.

428
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:19,100
How is it, Li Chengxi?

429
00:24:19,380 --> 00:24:21,010
Were you possessed just now?

430
00:24:34,580 --> 00:24:36,140
Your eyes didn't turn blue.

431
00:24:36,820 --> 00:24:38,820
That means it worked.

432
00:24:40,180 --> 00:24:41,460
Maybe, we're

433
00:24:41,860 --> 00:24:43,740
not intimate enough.

434
00:24:46,010 --> 00:24:48,820
It's possible.

435
00:24:50,900 --> 00:24:52,940
I have a book with some movements

436
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:54,420
that we can try.

437
00:24:55,380 --> 00:24:55,980
Look.

438
00:25:00,260 --> 00:25:00,730
This...

439
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:03,820
[×ography Writer——I won't tell you -Get on the horse]

440
00:25:04,930 --> 00:25:05,700
Where did you get this?

441
00:25:05,860 --> 00:25:07,860
It was in between Zhi's dialogue novel.

442
00:25:08,020 --> 00:25:09,740
He read it secretly, so I confiscated it.

443
00:25:11,820 --> 00:25:12,820
No.

444
00:25:12,980 --> 00:25:13,620
It's inappropriate.

445
00:25:13,820 --> 00:25:16,020
Why is it inappropriate? I think some...

446
00:25:16,300 --> 00:25:16,940
No.

447
00:25:17,500 --> 00:25:18,220
Yes.

448
00:25:18,500 --> 00:25:19,060
Just take a look.

449
00:25:19,060 --> 00:25:19,580
No.

450
00:25:36,060 --> 00:25:36,780
Li Chengxi.

451
00:25:37,620 --> 00:25:39,740
Your eyes are turning blue.
