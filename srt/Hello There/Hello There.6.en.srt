to be depressed like this either.

I thought you were just neglectful of your duties.

I didn't expect

you to be so cruel.

31
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,820
You colluded with the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain to kidnap senior sister

32
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:36,810
and even killed her.

Senior sister.

She committed suicide.

37
00:05:45,850 --> 00:05:47,060
Nonsense!

38
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:49,700
Why would she commit suicide

39
00:05:50,220 --> 00:05:51,330
and abandon her position as chief?

40
00:05:53,659 --> 00:05:55,659
You must have killed her together.

41
00:05:56,180 --> 00:05:57,780
I want to kill you to avenge her!

In our sect,

you and I were the ones closest to senior sister.

45
00:06:33,040 --> 00:06:35,570
I'm just as sad that she's gone.

46
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:38,060
But she really committed suicide.

47
00:06:38,659 --> 00:06:40,460
This has nothing to do with

48
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:41,420
Li Chengxi and Yun Gaixue.

49
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:43,220

51

If you don't believe me,

52
00:06:47,060 --> 00:06:48,690
you can go and confirm it with Know-It-All.

53
00:06:49,580 --> 00:06:50,180
At that time,

54
00:06:50,659 --> 00:06:52,540
you and the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain were the only ones there.

55
00:06:52,940 --> 00:06:54,100
Of course the officials will believe

56
00:06:54,659 --> 00:06:55,780
whatever you say.

don't gloat too soon.

59

I'm not the only one who wants to kill you.

60
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:04,340
There's also...

61
00:07:10,730 --> 00:07:11,300
Senior brother.

62
00:07:21,180 --> 00:07:21,820
Obviously,

63
00:07:22,780 --> 00:07:24,140
Chang Feng was being used

64
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,540
and now he's been silenced.

65
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:30,980
Although Young Mistress Tang is free-spirited,

66
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:32,860
she always has Tang Sect's best interests in mind.

67
00:07:33,540 --> 00:07:34,580
Moreover, she and Chief Lan

68
00:07:34,659 --> 00:07:35,900
were as close as sisters.

69
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,700
Besides,

70
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:39,900
Chief Lan had already planned

71
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,180
to pass her position to Buyan

72
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:42,460
when she comes of age.

73
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:45,300
Buyan has no reason to kill Chief Lan.

74
00:07:59,380 --> 00:08:00,580
How is your internal injury?

75
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:03,620
It's nothing serious.

76
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:05,810
Do you have any idea

77
00:08:06,180 --> 00:08:07,490
who the man in black today was?

78
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:09,460
All these years,

79
00:08:09,540 --> 00:08:10,580
I've been doing blood tests for the Destined One everywhere

80
00:08:10,850 --> 00:08:11,820
and have offended many people.

81
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,740
People have tried to kill me before.

82
00:08:14,140 --> 00:08:16,580
The man in black must be one of them.

83
00:08:17,380 --> 00:08:18,180
But don't worry.

84
00:08:18,380 --> 00:08:19,500
I've sent someone to investigate it.

85
00:08:21,820 --> 00:08:23,180
The man in black is very skilled.

86
00:08:23,660 --> 00:08:25,180
You must be more careful in future.

87
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,700
Don't go out alone

88
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,460
and strengthen defence within Tang Sect.

89
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:31,340
It's fine.

90
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:32,299
Since I was young,

91
00:08:32,419 --> 00:08:33,940
countless people have been against me.

92
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:36,179
But I'm still alive and kicking.

93
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:44,380
I just didn't expect

94
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,580
Chang Feng to have such a big misunderstanding about me.

95
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:49,930
It's all my fault

96
00:08:50,740 --> 00:08:52,500
that the situation has reached this state.

97
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:54,380
Don't blame yourself too much.

98
00:08:55,100 --> 00:08:56,220
If it weren't for me,

99
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,140
senior sister and Chang Feng might not have died,

100
00:09:00,540 --> 00:09:01,660
and you wouldn't have gotten hurt.

101
00:09:02,980 --> 00:09:03,700
It's all my fault.

102
00:09:04,300 --> 00:09:04,980
One is willful

103
00:09:05,420 --> 00:09:06,780
because one has someone to rely on.

104
00:09:07,820 --> 00:09:08,380
It takes time

105
00:09:08,610 --> 00:09:10,220
for a person to become mature.

106
00:09:15,570 --> 00:09:16,060
You're right.

107
00:09:17,180 --> 00:09:18,980
I'll be on my own from now on.

108
00:09:20,940 --> 00:09:22,260
I should pull myself together.

109
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:25,780
I'm sorry.

110
00:09:26,300 --> 00:09:28,620
I didn't know you were looking for your Destined One before,

111
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:29,700
so I misunderstood you.

112
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:31,820
It's okay.

113
00:09:32,300 --> 00:09:33,540
I'm used to it anyway.

114
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:36,180
Do you have other solutions

115
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:37,420
for your blood vessel issue?

116
00:09:39,340 --> 00:09:41,020
If I had another solution,

117
00:09:41,540 --> 00:09:42,860
I wouldn't have ended up like this.

118
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:45,500
My brother and senior sister would also not have...

119
00:09:53,980 --> 00:09:55,420
If you need to do blood tests for the Destined One,

120
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:56,820
Xue and I can...

121
00:10:02,020 --> 00:10:03,020
Li Chengxi.

122
00:10:04,060 --> 00:10:05,020
Don't tell me

123
00:10:05,500 --> 00:10:06,780
you were with this ugly monster

124
00:10:07,020 --> 00:10:08,140
since last night.

125
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:08,820
Xue.

126
00:10:09,460 --> 00:10:10,020
Don't be rude.

127
00:10:11,460 --> 00:10:12,140
Li Chengxi.

128
00:10:12,740 --> 00:10:13,660

not her!

130
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:15,650
You are with her everyday and negelecting me

131
00:10:15,650 --> 00:10:16,660
and neglect me.

132
00:10:16,740 --> 00:10:17,100
No.

133
00:10:17,220 --> 00:10:18,100
What do you mean, no?

134
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:18,780
Have you forgotten

135
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,740
how much you used to dislike

136
00:10:19,740 --> 00:10:20,820
this ugly monster?

137
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:21,860
Tell me...

138
00:10:25,420 --> 00:10:26,020
The Blood Testing Stone.

139
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,940
You stabbed me?

140
00:10:47,540 --> 00:10:48,100
Let me do it.

141
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:17,850
I always thought

142
00:11:18,340 --> 00:11:19,780
you were my Destined One.

143
00:11:21,100 --> 00:11:23,820
As expected, dreams rarely come true.

144
00:11:25,210 --> 00:11:26,020
See it now?

145
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,100
Don't bother my brother anymore.

146
00:11:29,500 --> 00:11:31,580
But even if we're not each other's Destined One,

147
00:11:31,860 --> 00:11:33,580
it's fate made us go through so much together

148
00:11:33,740 --> 00:11:34,820
so much together.

149
00:11:35,220 --> 00:11:36,620
Let's be buddies from now on.

150
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:38,100
Buddies?

151
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:40,100
You're still stealing my brother?

152
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:41,660
You're getting bolder.

153
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,340
Anyway,

154
00:11:44,380 --> 00:11:46,300
thank you for voluntarily helping me with blood testing.

155
00:11:49,220 --> 00:11:50,540
If you really want to thank me,

156
00:11:51,380 --> 00:11:52,300
just give me the Book of...

157
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:52,900
Xue.

158
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:04,860
Li Chengxi.

159
00:12:05,380 --> 00:12:05,860
Let me ask you.

160
00:12:06,370 --> 00:12:07,010
How could you let her test your blood

161
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:07,780
so easily?

162
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:08,740
Didn't you say

163
00:12:08,740 --> 00:12:10,170
we came here for the Book of Yueque?

164
00:12:10,810 --> 00:12:11,380
Yes.

165
00:12:11,700 --> 00:12:13,300
Then why did you stop me from asking her for it just now?

166
00:12:13,420 --> 00:12:14,460
It's not the right time yet.

167
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:16,940
Then when is the right time?

168
00:12:17,530 --> 00:12:18,020
Just wait.

169
00:12:19,020 --> 00:12:20,420
I have something to do.

170
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:22,500
Something to do?

171
00:12:24,780 --> 00:12:26,260

Only the Wushan that blooms on Xuanqi Mountain once every three years

But in order to completely eliminate the demonic energy,

205

we need to practice the Book of Yueque.

I...

341
00:22:29,740 --> 00:22:30,140
Oh no.

342
00:22:34,380 --> 00:22:34,780
Oh no.

343
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:35,620
It's okay. I...

344
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:52,220
You're fine now.

345
00:22:59,060 --> 00:22:59,420
You...

346
00:22:59,940 --> 00:23:01,020
Don't get me wrong.

347
00:23:01,420 --> 00:23:03,540
I was just trying to suck the bee's poison out.

348
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:04,900
You saved me

349
00:23:04,940 --> 00:23:06,820
and I saved you back, so we're even.

350
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:07,780
You're welcome.

351
00:23:08,500 --> 00:23:09,500
I didn't misunderstand you.

352
00:23:19,900 --> 00:23:20,580
I get it.

353
00:23:21,220 --> 00:23:22,100
It has to be symmetrical, right?

354
00:23:24,700 --> 00:23:25,180
Got it.

355
00:23:25,940 --> 00:23:26,460
Here.

356
00:23:36,820 --> 00:23:37,540
Don't worry.

357
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,660
I made it very symmetrical.

358
00:24:02,580 --> 00:24:03,500
What's wrong?

359
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:10,820
You'll

360
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:12,660
get poisoned too.

361
00:24:12,770 --> 00:24:13,460
It's fine.

362
00:24:13,980 --> 00:24:16,580
There is a little toxin in the blood of all Tang Sect members.

363
00:24:17,300 --> 00:24:18,420
An ordinary toxin like this

364
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:19,900
has no effect on us.

365
00:24:56,020 --> 00:24:57,060
Li Chengxi.

366
00:24:59,420 --> 00:25:00,380
Are you okay?

367
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,580
I'm fine.

368
00:25:05,540 --> 00:25:06,900
What happened to my mouth?

369
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:09,380
The effect of the poison on your mouth hasn't subsided.

370
00:25:09,780 --> 00:25:10,660
I applied some medicine for you.

371
00:25:12,060 --> 00:25:12,700
Thank you.

372
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:13,660
By the way,

373
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:15,810
I'm here to inform you about something.

374
00:25:16,580 --> 00:25:17,020
What's the matter?

375
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:18,180
A few days ago,

376
00:25:18,330 --> 00:25:20,220
I heard some rumors on my way

377
00:25:20,660 --> 00:25:23,570
that the Wushan in your Xuanqi Mountain can cure all diseases

378
00:25:23,740 --> 00:25:25,420
and even boosts your power and skills.

379
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:27,180
Many people are planning to come to Xuanqi Mountain

380
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,060
for a piece of the pie.

381
00:25:28,300 --> 00:25:28,780
I

382
00:25:28,940 --> 00:25:30,660
travelled all day and night without rest

383
00:25:31,260 --> 00:25:32,700
just to arrive before them

384
00:25:32,860 --> 00:25:33,820
to inform you first.

385
00:25:35,060 --> 00:25:36,340
Brother, let me tell you. I just...

386
00:25:39,820 --> 00:25:41,660
Who is this ugly monster with a sausage mouth?

387
00:25:41,980 --> 00:25:42,940
She's even uglier than Tang Buyan.

388
00:25:45,260 --> 00:25:46,050
Tang Buyan?

389
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:47,700
Why are you here?

390
00:25:48,060 --> 00:25:49,620
Brother, did you go down the mountain without telling me?

391
00:25:49,780 --> 00:25:50,980
Why did you bring the ugly monster here?

392
00:25:51,060 --> 00:25:51,500
Xue.

393
00:25:52,340 --> 00:25:52,900
Don't be rude.

394
00:25:55,940 --> 00:25:56,740
Tang Buyan.

395
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,100
How dare you bite my brother!

396
00:25:59,340 --> 00:26:00,700
I was saving him.

397
00:26:00,900 --> 00:26:02,540
I sucked the bee's poison out for him.

398
00:26:03,780 --> 00:26:05,580
The one on the right is bee poison. Then what about the left one?

399
00:26:06,260 --> 00:26:08,300
You know your brother has OCD.

400
00:26:08,330 --> 00:26:09,340
So what?

401
00:26:09,420 --> 00:26:10,580
His OCD doesn't mean you can bite him.

402
00:26:12,060 --> 00:26:12,380
What are you doing?

403
00:26:12,380 --> 00:26:12,820
Stop!

404
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:13,500
Brother, don't worry.

405
00:26:13,620 --> 00:26:14,180
I won't kill her.

406
00:26:14,420 --> 00:26:14,980
Let's bite her back.

407
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:15,940
An eye for an eye.

408
00:26:16,220 --> 00:26:16,700
Stop it.

409
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:17,820
All visitors are guests.

410
00:26:20,780 --> 00:26:21,900
Yun Gaixue.

411
00:26:22,300 --> 00:26:24,340
You're still as annoying as ever.

412
00:26:25,570 --> 00:26:27,540
I'm here to inform you

413
00:26:28,180 --> 00:26:30,220
that many people are trying to steal your Wushan.

414
00:26:30,660 --> 00:26:31,140
What?

415
00:26:31,540 --> 00:26:33,140
How dare they covet my stuff?

416
00:26:33,700 --> 00:26:34,300
Let them try.

417
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:35,450
I'll kill them all.

418
00:26:36,900 --> 00:26:37,820
Do not resort to killing.

419
00:26:38,500 --> 00:26:39,820
You always talk about fighting and killing.

420
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:40,740
So vulgar.

421
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:42,020
Look at your brother.

422
00:26:42,900 --> 00:26:43,780
By the way, Li Chengxi,

423
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:45,660
is Wushan really that miraculous?

424
00:26:45,980 --> 00:26:46,660
What does it look like?

425
00:26:46,860 --> 00:26:48,050
Can you show me?

426
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:49,180
The Wushan has not matured yet.

427
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:51,380
Is it big?

428
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:54,060
When it has matured, can I have a small piece?

429
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,940
What if it could cure my disease?

430
00:26:56,060 --> 00:26:56,820
Dream on.

431
00:26:57,420 --> 00:26:58,620
Why would our Xuanqi Mountain's treasure

432
00:26:58,620 --> 00:26:59,610
be given to an outsider like you?

433
00:27:00,780 --> 00:27:02,220
I gave you my Book of Yueque.

434
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:04,100
Yet you can't even give me a small piece of Wushan?

435
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:05,700
Wushan does not work against your disease.

436
00:27:06,820 --> 00:27:07,740
We won't know

437
00:27:07,810 --> 00:27:09,300
if it works until we try.

438
00:27:10,820 --> 00:27:11,260
Okay.

439
00:27:11,940 --> 00:27:13,180
Let's talk about it again when the Wushan has matured.

440
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,500
Then I'll stay and wait.

441
00:27:16,420 --> 00:27:17,500
You even want to stay?

442
00:27:17,980 --> 00:27:20,540
You can't live on Xuanqi Mountain for free.

443
00:27:21,300 --> 00:27:22,980
I'm not a freeloader.

444
00:27:23,260 --> 00:27:24,460
I'll pay, okay?

445
00:27:24,740 --> 00:27:27,020
What I don't lack is money.

446
00:27:30,700 --> 00:27:31,330
Where is my money?

447
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:34,340
Where is your money?

448
00:27:35,020 --> 00:27:35,620
Where is your money?

449
00:27:36,740 --> 00:27:38,250
Did someone steal it?

450
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:41,260
I'll borrow it.

451
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:42,940
Can I borrow it?

452
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:43,580
No.

453
00:27:44,180 --> 00:27:45,780
No pain, no gain.

454
00:27:45,780 --> 00:27:47,420
This is how we do it on Xuanqi Mountain.

455
00:27:47,580 --> 00:27:48,740
Even I have to make money.

456
00:27:49,020 --> 00:27:49,940
If you want money,

457
00:27:49,980 --> 00:27:50,980
you have to stay and work.

458
00:27:51,180 --> 00:27:51,580
You...

459
00:27:52,420 --> 00:27:54,940
Don't tell me Tang Sect members are so spoiled

460
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,060
you don't even know how to work?

461
00:27:56,220 --> 00:27:58,380
Who says so?

462
00:27:58,540 --> 00:27:59,220
Fine, I'll work.

463
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:00,260
I have nothing to fear.

464
00:28:07,860 --> 00:28:08,730
This commotion about Wushan.

465
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:10,580
Someone must be targeting Xuanqi Mountain.

466
00:28:11,250 --> 00:28:11,890
Go and check

467
00:28:12,660 --> 00:28:13,300
who is

468
00:28:13,660 --> 00:28:15,140
spreading the rumor.

469
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:16,420
Yes.

470
00:28:26,460 --> 00:28:27,580
Work hard.

471
00:28:27,900 --> 00:28:28,490
Don't slack off.

472
00:28:28,860 --> 00:28:29,900
Or else I'll punish you.

473
00:28:30,300 --> 00:28:30,700
Yes.

474
00:28:38,540 --> 00:28:40,100
A devious and domineering young master

475
00:28:40,940 --> 00:28:42,860
with a witty, cute and pretty wife.

476
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:45,860
How sweet.

477
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:49,220
This young master

478
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,580
is of age.

479
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:53,380
Why didn't he bring a wife home?

480
00:28:59,860 --> 00:29:01,220
Here comes the wife.

481
00:29:03,370 --> 00:29:03,740
Young Master.

482
00:29:03,900 --> 00:29:04,420
Second Young Master.

483
00:29:06,540 --> 00:29:08,140
This is the butler of Xuanqi Mountain, Zhi.

484
00:29:09,180 --> 00:29:09,740
Zhi.

485
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,260
This is Tang Buyan, the chief of Tang Sect.

486
00:29:14,260 --> 00:29:15,980
Show them around our farm

487
00:29:16,460 --> 00:29:17,980
and assign work to her and Xue.

488
00:29:18,820 --> 00:29:19,500
Yes, Young Master.

489
00:29:19,940 --> 00:29:21,180
Our farm is divided into

490
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:22,740
the livestock area in the front yard

491
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:24,140
and the crops area behind the mountain.

492
00:29:24,420 --> 00:29:25,380
The main tasks in the livestock area include

493
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:26,980
transporting and applying fertilizer,

494
00:29:27,530 --> 00:29:28,380
catching geese and gathering eggs,

495
00:29:28,660 --> 00:29:29,300
and prodding donkeys to grind beans.

496
00:29:29,980 --> 00:29:31,090
The main tasks in the crops area behind the mountain

497
00:29:31,180 --> 00:29:32,260
include picking fruits,

498
00:29:32,900 --> 00:29:33,700
transporting water for irrigation,

499
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:34,660
and removing weeds.

500
00:29:35,460 --> 00:29:37,260
I'll work with the crops and she'll work with the manure.

501
00:29:37,460 --> 00:29:38,620
I'm the chief of the Tang Sect.

502
00:29:38,700 --> 00:29:40,300
How dare you make me work with manure?

503
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,010
Second Young Master.

504
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:43,380
There are tons of poisonous bees behind the mountain.

505
00:29:43,460 --> 00:29:44,180
Aren't you afraid?

506
00:29:44,220 --> 00:29:45,610
I'm the great devil.

507
00:29:45,810 --> 00:29:46,700
Why would I be afraid of poisonous bees?

508
00:29:49,140 --> 00:29:50,380
Thank you, Second Young Master.

509
00:29:52,180 --> 00:29:53,260
You have no idea

510
00:29:53,460 --> 00:29:55,340
how your brother and I were almost poisoned to death

511
00:29:55,540 --> 00:29:57,180
when we were behind the mountain.

512
00:29:57,980 --> 00:29:59,820
Asking me to work behind the mountains

513
00:30:00,220 --> 00:30:01,820
is akin to sending me to my death.

514
00:30:02,380 --> 00:30:02,820
So,

515
00:30:03,050 --> 00:30:04,700
thank you for your consideration.

516
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:07,180
As long as I don't have to be around those poisonous bees,

517
00:30:07,460 --> 00:30:09,330
it doesn't matter if I have to carry 100 buckets of manure.

518
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:10,700
Wait. Stop.

519
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:12,180
I change my mind.

520
00:30:12,740 --> 00:30:14,060
You'll work with the crops

521
00:30:14,100 --> 00:30:15,100
and I'll work with the manure.

522
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,740
How can you go back on your word?

523
00:30:19,010 --> 00:30:20,460
If you don't let me work with the manure,

524
00:30:20,780 --> 00:30:22,540
then aren't you sending me to my death?

525
00:30:22,700 --> 00:30:24,900
I'm the Second Young Master of Xuanqi Mountain.

526
00:30:25,020 --> 00:30:26,420
My word is law.

527
00:30:26,540 --> 00:30:27,140
No.

528
00:30:27,260 --> 00:30:28,100
I'll work with the manure.

529
00:30:30,420 --> 00:30:31,100
Get out of the way.

530
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:34,620
Get out of the way!

531
00:30:40,580 --> 00:30:41,180
You ugly monster!

532
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:41,460
You...

533
00:30:41,490 --> 00:30:42,060
Second Young Master.

534
00:30:42,970 --> 00:30:44,100
Yun Gaixue.

535
00:30:44,540 --> 00:30:46,060
Why did you fall down?

536
00:30:46,330 --> 00:30:46,940
Are you okay?

537
00:30:47,620 --> 00:30:49,460
Just let me work with the manure.

538
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:50,580
Please.

539
00:30:51,100 --> 00:30:51,980
No.

540
00:30:52,540 --> 00:30:53,980
I said I'll work with the manure.

541
00:30:54,140 --> 00:30:54,780
It's decided.

542
00:30:57,180 --> 00:30:57,580
Young Master,

543
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,180
you'll supervise Miss Tang.

544
00:30:59,340 --> 00:31:00,220
I'll supervise Second Young Master.

545
00:31:00,410 --> 00:31:00,810
Good.

546
00:31:07,380 --> 00:31:09,140
My brother has always been stern and merciless

547
00:31:09,540 --> 00:31:10,700
while Zhi is lax.

548
00:31:31,820 --> 00:31:32,330
Zhi.

549
00:31:32,940 --> 00:31:33,420
You do it.

550
00:31:33,700 --> 00:31:34,820
No.

551
00:31:54,620 --> 00:31:55,140
It's scratched.

552
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:02,020
Does it hurt?

553
00:32:02,940 --> 00:32:03,740
It's just a minor injury.

554
00:32:04,220 --> 00:32:05,060
It will heal soon.

555
00:32:05,730 --> 00:32:06,980
You don't have to worry, Miss Tang.

556
00:32:07,340 --> 00:32:08,900
No matter how small the injury is, it's still a wound.

557
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:10,460
What if it gets infected?

558
00:32:11,380 --> 00:32:12,300
Let me bandage it for you.

559
00:32:31,540 --> 00:32:32,500
Move along.

560
00:32:33,460 --> 00:32:34,140
Let's go.

561
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,420
Let's go.

562
00:32:40,900 --> 00:32:42,260
Can you move?

563
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:45,140
Come on.

564
00:32:45,700 --> 00:32:47,770
Move along.

565
00:32:50,620 --> 00:32:51,700
Move along.

566
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:52,700
Let's go.

567
00:32:53,620 --> 00:32:54,380
Let's go.

568
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,500
How dare you steal food?

569
00:33:10,300 --> 00:33:10,780
Sugar cake.

570
00:33:14,020 --> 00:33:15,020
Second Young Master,

571
00:33:15,340 --> 00:33:16,570
you have to hurry up.

572
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:19,180
Otherwise, you won't have food to eat later.

573
00:33:44,540 --> 00:33:47,140
Second Young Master, come on.

574
00:33:52,940 --> 00:33:53,940
Second Young Master.

575
00:33:54,220 --> 00:33:55,060
Zhi.

576
00:34:05,340 --> 00:34:07,180
I'm so relaxed.

577
00:34:07,860 --> 00:34:09,260
Tang Buyan wouldn't have imagined this.

578
00:34:10,540 --> 00:34:11,820
She must be especially miserable now.

579
00:34:27,780 --> 00:34:28,620
What a bitter life.

580
00:34:29,860 --> 00:34:31,300
Yong,

581
00:34:32,100 --> 00:34:34,380
you suffered a miserable death.
