4
00:01:41,780 --> 00:01:43,300
Physician Yan, help!

5
00:02:26,579 --> 00:02:27,540
It seems that your heart disease

6
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,410
is getting worse.

7
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:31,340
What... What heart disease?

8
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:32,820
You...

9
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:37,940
Don't talk nonsense.

10
00:02:38,180 --> 00:02:40,130
I'm just having a fever.

11
00:02:41,660 --> 00:02:41,900
A fever?

12
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:42,340
Come on.

13
00:02:42,579 --> 00:02:44,020
Don't argue with me.

14
00:02:44,300 --> 00:02:45,810
The cure for your heart disease is right here.

15
00:02:58,260 --> 00:02:59,940
Why hasn't Li Chengxi woken up yet?

16
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:01,980
Didn't he use icy martial skill

17
00:03:02,020 --> 00:03:03,140
to freeze us?

18
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,700
You see, this idiot

19
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:08,020
has protected you with his inner strength.

20
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:09,130
So you're fine.

21
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:11,180
As for him,

22
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,220
you'd better begin to prepare for his funeral.

23
00:03:17,579 --> 00:03:18,380
Li Chengxi.

24
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:23,540
Poor thing.

25
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:25,460
He hasn't

26
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,300
got married yet.

27
00:03:28,579 --> 00:03:30,500
Now he will go to hell at such a young age.

28
00:03:39,780 --> 00:03:41,380
Is there really no hope for him?

29
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,100
If he met someone else,

30
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:45,660
of course not.

31
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:47,500
But he is lucky

32
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:48,500
to meet me.

33
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:50,900
I tried so hard

34
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:52,940
to pull him back from the King of Hell.

35
00:03:54,380 --> 00:03:55,740
It's just that

36
00:03:57,740 --> 00:03:59,780
many parts of his body haven't defrosted yet.

37
00:04:00,060 --> 00:04:02,700
We need a human body to warm him up.

38
00:04:03,580 --> 00:04:04,820
A human body?

39
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,620
Thank you, Physician Yan.

40
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:10,940
I'll go make the medicine.

41
00:04:11,540 --> 00:04:12,580
I'll leave him to you.

42
00:04:35,380 --> 00:04:36,940
What happened to my brother, you maniac?

43
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,580
Li Chengxi.

44
00:04:44,180 --> 00:04:45,700
Please get better soon.

45
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,300
How is Dear Li?

46
00:04:55,300 --> 00:04:56,220
How is my brother?

47
00:04:57,659 --> 00:04:58,340
What?

48
00:04:58,810 --> 00:05:00,020
You don't trust my medical skills?

49
00:05:00,380 --> 00:05:02,300
No, we're just worried about them.

50
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,580
You crazy bastard! Tell me!

51
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:05,900
How is my brother?

52
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:07,260
Nah, I'd better go check on him.

53
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,260
Didn't you say

54
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:12,900
they suffered from frostbite?

55
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:14,580
I practiced fire martial skill.

56
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,940
It can help my brother get defrosted.

57
00:05:16,250 --> 00:05:17,340
With your power,

58
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:18,980
you'll burn them to death.

59
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:19,410
I...

60
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:20,220
Enough.

61
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,420
Physician Yan, I'm really worried about Yan.

62
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:29,860
Let me take a look.

63
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:31,420
After all, I'm her Destined One.

64
00:05:31,900 --> 00:05:34,020
I'll spend the rest of my life with her.

65
00:05:37,490 --> 00:05:38,940
It's not that I don't want you to go in.

66
00:05:39,220 --> 00:05:40,260
This is the first time I've met this kind of situation

67
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:42,300
since I practiced medicine.

68
00:05:42,540 --> 00:05:43,820
It took me 10...

69
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:44,940
no...

70
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,620
12 levels of my power

71
00:05:47,860 --> 00:05:50,100
to pull them back from hell.

72
00:05:50,380 --> 00:05:51,980
Now it is the critical moment for their treatments.

73
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:53,659
If I let you in rashly,

74
00:05:53,780 --> 00:05:54,820
all my efforts will be

75
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,980
in vain.

76
00:05:56,380 --> 00:05:56,900
But they are alone in the room,

77
00:05:57,220 --> 00:05:59,060
as a single man and a single woman.

78
00:05:59,300 --> 00:06:00,610
I'm afraid it'll damage Yan's reputation.

79
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:01,660
That's right.

80
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:03,180
There are so many rooms in Fengming Pavilion.

81
00:06:03,260 --> 00:06:04,660
I'll just open another room for her.

82
00:06:04,940 --> 00:06:06,860
Then I have to go back and forth in two rooms.

83
00:06:06,980 --> 00:06:08,170
If it affects the treatments,

84
00:06:08,500 --> 00:06:10,420
and causes them to be disabled for the rest of their lives,

85
00:06:11,140 --> 00:06:13,180
will it make your wish come ture?

86
00:06:13,260 --> 00:06:13,820
I...

87
00:06:14,250 --> 00:06:15,700
Or for Mr. Li, is Tang Buyan's reputation

88
00:06:16,060 --> 00:06:18,500
more important than her life?

89
00:06:18,700 --> 00:06:19,100
I

90
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:21,740
didn't mean that.

91
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:23,020
All right.

92
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:25,410
The patients need to rest.

93
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,460
Don't bother them anymore.

94
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,020
If you keep pestering me,

95
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:30,540
I won't treat them.

96
00:06:30,540 --> 00:06:31,340
Xue.

97
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:32,740
Let's go.

98
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:37,220
Listen.

99
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,650
Don't go in there.

100
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:40,300
If you affect my brother's treatment,

101
00:06:41,170 --> 00:06:42,180
I'll teach you a lesson.

102
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,300

If it weren't for me,

00:08:07,180 --> 00:08:09,010
you wouldn't have been hurt so badly.

139

It's all my fault.

140
00:08:12,370 --> 00:08:13,410
I'd rather get hurt myself than

141
00:08:14,980 --> 00:08:16,220
let anything happen to you.

142
00:08:21,660 --> 00:08:23,380
I don't want anything to happen to you, either.

143

What are you...

00:08:35,380 --> 00:08:35,780
Brother,

149
00:08:36,380 --> 00:08:37,580
that Blood Testing Stone was fake.

150
00:08:42,210 --> 00:08:43,220
I'm not blaming you.

151
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:44,780
I've worked so hard for you.

152
00:08:44,780 --> 00:08:46,100
Why didn't you try harder?

153
00:08:47,460 --> 00:08:48,180
Do you really think

154
00:08:48,180 --> 00:08:49,380
you're Tang Buyan's Destined One?

155
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:50,940
If I hadn't applied the Blood Testing Stone,

156
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,180
do you think that thing would have glowed?

157
00:08:55,540 --> 00:08:56,340
You mean

158
00:08:56,900 --> 00:08:58,540
I'm not Yan's Destined One?

159
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:01,100
You didn't seize the great chance

160
00:09:01,100 --> 00:09:02,020
this morning.

161
00:09:02,340 --> 00:09:03,140
I'm so mad.

162
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:16,220
Hi.

163
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,220
Hi.

164
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:22,900
Brother.

165
00:09:23,580 --> 00:09:25,290
this demoness said it herself.

166
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:01,660
You really played some tricks.

167
00:10:03,580 --> 00:10:04,220
Tell us.

168
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:05,260
What happened?

169
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,660
I just made a joke.

170
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:09,610
Yes.

171
00:10:09,810 --> 00:10:10,370
This thing

172
00:10:10,530 --> 00:10:11,420
only works for seven days.

173
00:10:11,580 --> 00:10:12,770
It won't work after seven days.

174
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,540
It'll stop working the day after tomorrow.

175
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,220
Let's test again the day after tomorrow.

176
00:10:16,490 --> 00:10:17,100
Don't bother.

177
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:19,340
Yan, I...

178
00:10:19,540 --> 00:10:20,620
The Blood Testing Stone was a joke.

179
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:21,780
What about the incense?

180
00:10:25,940 --> 00:10:26,850
So this morning，

181
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:28,140
it was you.

182
00:10:28,980 --> 00:10:29,460
No.

183
00:10:29,740 --> 00:10:30,180
Enough.

184
00:10:30,980 --> 00:10:32,060
Yan and I need to rest.

185
00:10:32,530 --> 00:10:33,370
You may leave.

186
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:38,140
Didn't you hear that?

187
00:10:38,380 --> 00:10:39,580
My brother wants to rest.

188
00:10:40,260 --> 00:10:40,820
Get lost.

189
00:10:41,380 --> 00:10:41,820
Go!

190
00:10:43,700 --> 00:10:44,380
Go!

191
00:11:01,980 --> 00:11:02,780
I...

192
00:11:05,780 --> 00:11:08,180
I just said no more tests.

193
00:11:08,380 --> 00:11:09,060
It's for real.

194
00:11:09,660 --> 00:11:10,700
I've thought it through.

195
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:13,660
Even if Li Jian is my Destined One,

196
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:17,490
I don't want to be with him unhappily.

197
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:22,130
I still

198
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:25,180
want to be with

199
00:11:25,780 --> 00:11:26,580
the person I like.

200
00:11:38,900 --> 00:11:39,620
Yan.

201
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,100
I came this morning

202
00:11:41,820 --> 00:11:42,930
to tell you that

203
00:11:43,300 --> 00:11:44,820
when you had an outbreak of blood vessel disease,

204
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:45,740
and suddenly fainted yesterday,

205
00:11:46,060 --> 00:11:46,980
I injected the power of the Book of Yueque into your body

206
00:11:49,100 --> 00:11:50,780
under the emergency.

207
00:11:51,970 --> 00:11:52,780
Physician Yan said

208
00:11:53,500 --> 00:11:55,530
your blood vessel disease has indeed got better.

209
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,010
In other words,

210
00:11:57,380 --> 00:11:59,340
if someone can help us decipher the Book of Yueque,

211
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:01,980
maybe it can cure your blood vessel disease.

212
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:03,220
Really?

213
00:12:03,580 --> 00:12:04,540
That's great.

214
00:12:05,740 --> 00:12:06,540
Yan.

215
00:12:07,820 --> 00:12:08,860
There's something

216
00:12:10,340 --> 00:12:11,490
I didn't dare to tell you before.

217
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:14,780
Now that I've found another solution,

218
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,420
I can finally tell you.

219
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:20,580
I like you.

220
00:12:22,180 --> 00:12:23,260
I've fallen in love with you

221
00:12:23,980 --> 00:12:25,260
since Xuanqi Mountain.

222
00:12:35,220 --> 00:12:36,100
Li Chengxi,

223
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:38,740
don't feel too burdened.

224
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:41,260
Even if we can't decipher the Book of Yueque,

225
00:12:43,260 --> 00:12:44,340
I won't  regret

226
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:45,820
being with you.

227
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:49,700
Don't worry.

228
00:12:50,810 --> 00:12:51,650
As long as I'm here,

229
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:55,060
I will never let you leave me again.

230
00:13:09,060 --> 00:13:09,660
By the way,

231
00:13:10,380 --> 00:13:11,980
don't you always want to go shopping?

232
00:13:13,420 --> 00:13:14,620
I'll go shopping with you tomorrow

233
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:15,940
until you're satisfied.

234
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:17,140
Great.

235
00:13:18,970 --> 00:13:19,860
But...

236
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,700
Didn't you say you were badly injured?

237
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:24,540
I...

238
00:13:24,980 --> 00:13:25,780
I...

239
00:13:28,900 --> 00:13:30,100
Good for you, Li Chengxi.

240
00:13:30,580 --> 00:13:32,100
How dare you lie to me?

241
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:35,220
I won't do it again.

242
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:37,300
I was wrong.

243
00:14:01,100 --> 00:14:01,900
Do I look good?

244
00:14:06,460 --> 00:14:08,340
Of course. It was picked by me.

245
00:14:12,740 --> 00:14:14,180
I am talking about you.

246
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,420
Really?

247
00:14:19,300 --> 00:14:19,860
Let's go.

248
00:14:24,980 --> 00:14:26,860
Yan, I'm sorry about what happened before.

249
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,660
After the blood test tomorrow,

250

then I...

252
00:14:36,180 --> 00:14:38,020
I will never appear in front of you again.

253
00:14:38,740 --> 00:14:39,850
If I'm lucky,

254

I hope you can give me a chance

255
00:14:42,780 --> 00:14:44,290
to help you get rid of your blood vessel issue.

256
00:14:44,900 --> 00:14:46,900
I've told you that there's no need to test it.

Please get out of the way.
