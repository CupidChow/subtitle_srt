Let's see exactly who you are.

6

Li Chengtian! It's you bastard!

7
00:01:28,820 --> 00:01:29,730
Is he Li Chengtian?

8
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:37,259
Do it!

9
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:47,020
What are you doing?

10
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:49,050
Stop pretending.

11
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:51,660
My brother already knew there was something wrong with you.

12
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:56,410
Loser! If they didn't have evidence,

13
00:01:56,900 --> 00:01:58,220
how could they control you beforehand?

14
00:01:58,860 --> 00:01:59,660

16

Later, until Ruoyu exposed her identity and died,

18
00:02:06,620 --> 00:02:07,420
I could be sure

19
00:02:07,660 --> 00:02:09,100
there must be a mastermind

20
00:02:09,220 --> 00:02:10,660
behind all these.

21
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,260
And the person behind this

22
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,660
probably aimed at the Book of Yueque.

23
00:02:15,260 --> 00:02:16,460
I found something was wrong with Li Jian,

24
00:02:17,460 --> 00:02:18,660
and decided to play along.

25
00:02:19,100 --> 00:02:19,730
As a result,

26
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:21,500
he lured you out.

27
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:37,300
Come with me.

28
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:38,820

29
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:41,860

30

Yes.

35

Don't alarm him.

36
00:03:16,140 --> 00:03:18,060
Did you know there was something wrong with Li Jian?

37
00:03:19,900 --> 00:03:20,540
Yes.

38

39
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:34,900
Wait a minute.

40
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,780
When did you start suspecting me?

41
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:41,980
At the time when I first entered the valley.

42
00:04:00,300 --> 00:04:01,980
Yan, I just saw

43
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:03,420
the sign of Wushan.

44
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:05,060
The direction it points to

45
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:06,340
is the cave not far from here.

46
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:19,100
I thought

47
00:04:19,730 --> 00:04:21,339
you just wanted to be with Yan,

48
00:04:22,019 --> 00:04:24,700
so I tested you by suggesting to act separately in three groups.

49
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,940
Later,

50
00:04:33,740 --> 00:04:35,740
I found that you and Ruoyu had the same bell.

51
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:36,940
I realized

52
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,900
the mastermind behind you two

53
00:04:39,340 --> 00:04:40,340
was the same person.

54
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:44,780
Li Jian,

55
00:04:45,140 --> 00:04:46,380
you know that the Book of Yueque

56
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,020
is so important to me and Li Chengxi.

57
00:04:48,380 --> 00:04:49,700
Why are you still doing this?

58
00:04:49,980 --> 00:04:51,060
I did it for you.

59
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:52,700
If there is no Book of Yueque,

60
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:54,780
you can only be with me.

61

65

67

spend a short life with the one I love.

68

I don't want to go through the endless pain

69

with someone I don't love.

70

71

When I was traveling outside,

I got hurt by a thief.

and often disappeared for days.

99

when you would take me back to the Lingjue Sect.

101

Why did you betray me and marry someone else?

Marrying her can help me stabilize the Lingjue Sect.

00:11:22,220 --> 00:11:23,940
she turned against Master uncle.

173
00:11:24,610 --> 00:11:26,820
The Book of Xinyue was split into two.

174
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:30,290
Mother took away the Book of Yueque

175
00:11:30,940 --> 00:11:32,540
and lived in Serene Valley with a maid.

176
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:35,460
And then she married into the Tang Sect.

177
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,140
Master uncle

178
00:11:37,540 --> 00:11:39,060
took away the Book of Xincan instead.

179
00:11:39,510 --> 00:11:41,450
[The Book of Xinyue]

180
00:11:39,530 --> 00:11:40,900
He founded the Lingjue Sect.

181
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:54,220
My mother passed away when I was two.

182
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:58,220
I know that my mother left me the skills in the Book of Yueque.

183
00:11:59,140 --> 00:12:00,260
In order to complete my mother's undone career,

184
00:12:00,300 --> 00:12:01,620
I practiced hard.

185
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:04,020
But when I was 20,

186
00:12:04,300 --> 00:12:05,700
I started to age rapidly.

187
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:07,140
Then I realized that

188
00:12:07,340 --> 00:12:09,620
my mother was possessed by a demon

189
00:12:09,500 --> 00:12:11,430
[The Book of Yueque]

190
00:12:09,620 --> 00:12:10,740
because she was practicing the Book of Yueque.

191
00:12:11,980 --> 00:12:14,860
And this strange disease can also pass down to my descendants.

192
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,980
My children will die of the disease as well.

193
00:12:19,460 --> 00:12:21,100
Therefore, I went around to seek medical treatment,

194
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:23,820
but I never found a cure.

195
00:12:35,300 --> 00:12:36,060
Impossible.

196
00:12:37,700 --> 00:12:38,540
That's impossible.

197
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,340
To prevent my descendants from practicing it blindly,

198
00:12:44,100 --> 00:12:46,340
I could only divide the Book of Yueque into two

199
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:50,570
and keep the first half in the family's tomb.

200
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:52,500
The second half

201
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:55,420
was kept by the Shen family, which my mother's maid is from,

202
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,420
for generations.

203
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:15,570
The Shen family lived in seclusion in Serene Valley.

204
00:13:15,700 --> 00:13:17,700
To recognize the descendants of the maid,

205
00:13:17,940 --> 00:13:20,260
just take the person's blood from his heart and drip it on the Blood Testing Stone.

206
00:13:20,660 --> 00:13:22,300
If the Blood Testing Stone glows,

207
00:13:22,490 --> 00:13:24,340
the person is a descendant of the maid.

208
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,060
It turns out my way

209
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:27,300
to find the Destined One

210
00:13:27,300 --> 00:13:29,540
is wrong.

211
00:13:33,260 --> 00:13:34,740
Does it say

212
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:36,260
how to solve the blood vessel issue?

213
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:41,380
To solve the blood vessel issue in Tang family,

214
00:13:41,900 --> 00:13:44,820
the descendants of the Tang family need to find the person who practices the Book of Xincan,

215
00:13:44,980 --> 00:13:48,020
and combine it with the Book of Yueque into the Book of Xinyue.

216
00:13:48,420 --> 00:13:50,060
When the ninth level of power is achieved,

217
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,620
the power of catalysis will be produced.

218
00:13:52,260 --> 00:13:54,450
The Tang family's blood vessel issue will be solved.

219
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,420
The person who practices the Book of Xincan

220
00:13:57,980 --> 00:13:59,940
has a teardrop mole on his face.

221
00:14:01,170 --> 00:14:04,620
Because of the different property of their martial skills, the teardrop mole can either be red or blue.

222
00:14:06,420 --> 00:14:08,730
It really needs to be practiced with the Book of Xincan.

223
00:14:08,900 --> 00:14:10,300
Your speculation is correct.

224
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,770
So, I'm also her Destined One?

225
00:14:14,660 --> 00:14:16,540
Brother, I don't want to practice with this ugly monster.

226
00:14:16,930 --> 00:14:17,740
What are you thinking?

227
00:14:18,180 --> 00:14:19,620
She's your sister-in-law.

228
00:14:19,780 --> 00:14:20,290
What?

229
00:14:26,580 --> 00:14:27,540
Brother Yan is right.

230
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:48,980
Lord,

231
00:14:49,900 --> 00:14:51,700
thank you for giving us the Book of Yueque.

232
00:14:52,780 --> 00:14:54,530
We're going back.

233
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,010
Don't worry too much.

234
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:03,140
After all, Li Jian is Li Chengtian's son.

235
00:15:03,420 --> 00:15:04,700
He won't be hurt.

236
00:15:05,050 --> 00:15:07,020
Do you think she's worried?

237
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,820
Lord, we're leaving.

238
00:15:33,020 --> 00:15:34,980
Please take good care of yourself.

239
00:15:43,320 --> 00:15:43,820
Let's go.

240
00:16:22,500 --> 00:16:23,220
Zhi.

241
00:16:26,660 --> 00:16:27,660
Zhi!

242
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,900
Zhi!

243
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,340
Young Master. Miss Tang.

244
00:16:32,420 --> 00:16:33,300
Zhi.

245
00:16:33,540 --> 00:16:34,340
Zhi.

246
00:16:35,740 --> 00:16:37,930
I'm finally back in my place.

247
00:16:39,500 --> 00:16:40,300
Second Young Master.

248
00:16:41,460 --> 00:16:42,340
Physician Yan.

249
00:16:44,580 --> 00:16:46,620
Young Master. Second Young Master.

250
00:16:46,780 --> 00:16:48,260
You are finally back.

251
00:16:48,650 --> 00:16:50,330
I've lost weight

252
00:16:50,500 --> 00:16:51,900
because I worked so hard to manage Xuanqi Mountain.

253
00:16:59,570 --> 00:17:00,860
Because we lacked labor force in Xuanqi Mountain,

254
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:02,780
the production has decreased.

255
00:17:03,130 --> 00:17:04,500
Now that you're back,

256
00:17:05,220 --> 00:17:06,490
the problem of farm work is solved.

257
00:17:07,619 --> 00:17:08,500
So we are back

258
00:17:08,500 --> 00:17:09,900
only to do farm work for you.

259
00:17:09,980 --> 00:17:11,220
Zhi.

260
00:17:11,300 --> 00:17:12,500
No, no, no.

261
00:17:13,060 --> 00:17:14,900
I mean Ruoyu can do farm work.

262
00:17:20,569 --> 00:17:22,140
Where is Ruoyu?

263
00:17:24,140 --> 00:17:25,740
Where... Where is Ruoyu?

264
00:17:26,819 --> 00:17:27,730
My brother said

265
00:17:27,819 --> 00:17:28,820
Ruoyu found her family

266
00:17:28,940 --> 00:17:29,700
and went home.

267
00:17:30,140 --> 00:17:31,260
Her family?

268
00:17:31,930 --> 00:17:33,700
Ruoyu is so inconsiderate.

269
00:17:34,140 --> 00:17:35,460
Why didn't she send me a message?

270
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:37,900
Let's not talk about this.

271
00:17:38,220 --> 00:17:39,180
Let's talk about something happy.

272
00:17:39,580 --> 00:17:41,540
We finally found the Book of Yueque.

273
00:17:41,780 --> 00:17:43,740
How about having a celebration party tonight?

274
00:17:43,780 --> 00:17:44,900
Celebration party sounds good.

275
00:17:44,980 --> 00:17:45,540
Young Master,

276
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:46,300
we haven't done this in Xuanqi Mountain

277
00:17:46,340 --> 00:17:48,090
for a long time.

278
00:17:49,940 --> 00:17:52,380
Okay. Let's throw a celebration party.

279
00:17:53,140 --> 00:17:53,900
Tang Buyan.

280
00:17:54,180 --> 00:17:55,300
You wouldn't go back to the Tang Sect,

281
00:17:55,380 --> 00:17:57,060
and came to Xuanqi Mountain with us.

282
00:17:57,340 --> 00:17:59,020

Your tooth was not broken because of the hard rope
