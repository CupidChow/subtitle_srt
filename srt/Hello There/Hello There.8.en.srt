[Hello There]

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,010
[Episode 8]

4
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:54,410
Young Master.

5
00:00:54,620 --> 00:00:56,780
I didn't find the source of the Wushan rumors.

6
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:58,180
But I heard

7
00:00:58,580 --> 00:00:59,980
the assistant manager of Fengming Pavilion, Jin Badou,

8
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,060
has arrived at Xuanqi Mountain.

9
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:03,940
Maybe we can buy information from him.

10
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:04,860
Okay.

11
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:08,180
Zhi, go with Ruoyu.

12
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:09,020
Yes.

13
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,620
Young Master, there's one more thing.

14
00:01:11,140 --> 00:01:12,580
The martial artists who demanded for the Wushan yesterday

15
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:13,500
haven't left the mountain yet.

16
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:14,740
They are waiting outside the gate.

17
00:01:14,900 --> 00:01:16,090
They bribed the servants

18
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:18,060
and want to sneak in to steal the Wushan.

19
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,700
They refused to accept the real Wushan when it was offered to them,

20
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:22,980
yet they insist on stealing it.

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,500
Those idiots.

22
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:27,580
In that case,

23
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:31,580
we'll end them once and for all.

24
00:01:31,700 --> 00:01:33,500
Miss Tang, do you have any ideas?

25
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:40,500
Wait.

26
00:01:43,460 --> 00:01:43,900
Wait.

27
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:44,539
Wait.

28
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,100
What are you doing?

29
00:01:49,620 --> 00:01:50,660
Why are you sneaking around?

30
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:52,020
Brother.

31
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:53,979
My cousin's grandaunt's

32
00:01:53,979 --> 00:01:56,100
grandson's aunt's intimate friend

33
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:57,460
works as a servant in Xuanqi Mountain.

34
00:01:58,130 --> 00:01:59,180
He just told me

35
00:01:59,340 --> 00:02:00,650
that Wushan grows behind the mountain

36
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:02,220
and will mature tonight.

37
00:02:04,820 --> 00:02:05,460
Really?

38
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:07,420
Is your news reliable?

39
00:02:08,539 --> 00:02:09,979
I'm the Black Wind's Little Tyrant.

40
00:02:10,060 --> 00:02:10,940
Of course my news is reliable.

41
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:16,980
The details about your relative

42
00:02:17,890 --> 00:02:20,020
seem to have changed.

43
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:21,060
Have they changed?

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:21,900
Have they not?

45
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:23,900
Don't mind these trivial details.

46
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:24,900
The Wushan is the priority.

47
00:02:25,100 --> 00:02:26,220
That makes sense.

48
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:31,940
Let's go steal the Wushan today.

49
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:43,700
Look.

50
00:02:44,260 --> 00:02:46,700
This Wushan I've made is so exquisite

51
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,780
those scumbag martial artists

52
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:50,100
will never forget this.

53
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,940
It does look like a miraculous medicine.

54
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:54,980
But why does it have such a weird smell?

55
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,260
After all, Yun Gaixue

56
00:02:57,260 --> 00:02:59,090
personally doused this radish with manure.

57
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:03,540
I'll add some more bitter gourd juice.

58
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:09,260
That's perfect.

59
00:03:11,340 --> 00:03:12,060
How is it?

60
00:03:13,820 --> 00:03:15,260
What's going on?

61
00:03:15,860 --> 00:03:17,570
Why does I feel so weak?

62
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:20,220
Did someone poison me?

63
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:21,540
But I have to say

64
00:03:21,860 --> 00:03:24,730
that you're too rough with Yun Gaixue.

65
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:26,410
Even I'm shocked.

66
00:03:26,610 --> 00:03:27,700
I'm not as extreme as you.

67
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:29,380
The way you're making this medicine

68
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:30,980
looks quite disgusting.

69
00:03:32,290 --> 00:03:33,260
Ugly monster.

70
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:35,450
How dare you try to poison me?

71
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:36,690
I'll destroy you.

72
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:47,220
Xue.

73
00:03:47,579 --> 00:03:48,300
Brother, bad news!

74
00:03:48,460 --> 00:03:50,220
The ugly monster and this man are trying to kill us.

75
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,260
This is Physician Yan.

76
00:03:52,820 --> 00:03:54,260
He's here to treat you.

77
00:03:54,780 --> 00:03:55,410
He won't hurt you.

78
00:03:55,610 --> 00:03:56,579
Li Chengxi.

79
00:03:56,740 --> 00:03:58,420
Are you bewitched by the ugly monster?

80
00:03:58,780 --> 00:03:59,460
Let me tell you.

81
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:00,940
As long as I'm here,

82
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,380
you won't be able to attack Xuanqi Mountain.

83
00:04:02,380 --> 00:04:03,340
Stop messing around.

84
00:04:03,660 --> 00:04:05,290
Focus on cooperating with Physician Yan for your treatment.

85
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:08,980
Go to sleep.

86
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:16,779
Physician Yan,

87
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,940
please take care of my brother.

88
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:21,220
The Wushan is ready.

89
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:22,580
Let's prepare for the next step.

90
00:04:22,620 --> 00:04:23,170
Okay.

91
00:04:30,530 --> 00:04:31,140
Let's go.

92
00:04:42,740 --> 00:04:43,860
The great devil is awake.

93
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:45,380
How dare you do this to me?

94
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,020
When I can move,

95
00:04:47,020 --> 00:04:48,620
your corpse will be so disfigured nobody will know it's you.

96
00:04:48,900 --> 00:04:50,780
I really want to cut open your head

97
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,460
to see what it looks like inside.

98
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:54,280
You want to cut open my head?

99
00:04:58,420 --> 00:04:59,659
Why are you holding a spoon?

100
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:01,580
Do you really want to take my brain?

101
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:02,500
Don't you know

102
00:05:02,690 --> 00:05:04,060
strange doctors like me

103
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:06,020
like exotic food,

104
00:05:06,580 --> 00:05:08,100
especially the ones we've just dissected?

105
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,740
Sprinkle some cumin

106
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:14,380
and some salt and pepper.

107
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,500
Then, scoop up a mouthful

108
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:21,420
and you will experience a subtle

109
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:22,740
and lively

110
00:05:25,020 --> 00:05:25,940
taste.

111
00:05:27,100 --> 00:05:29,340
You lunatic! Even if I become a ghost,

112
00:05:29,660 --> 00:05:31,180
I will come back to kill you.

113
00:05:33,460 --> 00:05:34,500
I'm so scared.

114
00:05:36,820 --> 00:05:38,380
But you can't move now.

115
00:05:38,980 --> 00:05:40,290
How can you deal with me?

116
00:05:46,659 --> 00:05:47,900
You lunatic!

117
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:50,020
If you're so fearless, don't leave. Come back!

118
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:59,620
Great devil of Xuanqi Mountain?

119
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,660
All he can do

120
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:02,810
is making threats.

121
00:06:02,900 --> 00:06:04,300
Empty threats!

122
00:06:04,580 --> 00:06:07,180
Right? And they said this place is heavily guarded

123
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:07,940
and impenetrable?

124
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,340
I think Xuanqi Mountain

125
00:06:09,340 --> 00:06:11,500
is not even as good as our Black Wind Fortress' little hill.

126
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,900
It's a hike.

127
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:14,980
Look here.

128
00:06:15,780 --> 00:06:16,940
This won't do either.

129
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:18,780
They are looking down on me.

130
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:19,980
No.

131
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:21,700
It's me.

132
00:06:22,020 --> 00:06:22,940
What's the difference?

133
00:06:24,660 --> 00:06:26,340
How dare you look down on us!

134
00:06:26,580 --> 00:06:27,260
Fine.

135
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:28,620
In a moment, you'll experience

136
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,900
the multitude of traps I've prepared for you.

137
00:06:31,300 --> 00:06:32,850
Let's see if you still can laugh then.

138
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,300
If they fall into a trap

139
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:35,810
and get suspicious,

140
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:36,820
what should we do?

141
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:40,140
One never knows how to cherish things

142
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,100
that are easily obtained.

143
00:06:42,420 --> 00:06:45,020
Instead, things are only regarded as precious

144
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:46,620
if they are laboriously obtained.

145
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:48,409
Just wait and see.

146
00:07:29,300 --> 00:07:31,140
What great devil of Xuanqi Mountain?

147
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:33,020
Not only does he make threats,

148
00:07:33,140 --> 00:07:34,340
but also plays dirty.

149
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:35,490
I, Black Wind...

150
00:07:36,540 --> 00:07:37,500
I, Black Wind's Big Tyrant,

151
00:07:37,780 --> 00:07:39,490
despise them from the bottom of my heart.

152
00:07:39,740 --> 00:07:42,100
That's right. He even set up traps.

153
00:07:42,620 --> 00:07:44,580
He's more sinister than us.

154
00:07:44,900 --> 00:07:46,300
What great devil?

155
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:47,180
Big whoop!

156
00:07:49,659 --> 00:07:51,050
Is that the Wushan?

157
00:07:58,900 --> 00:08:01,260
We've traveled across much land and water,

158
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,300
and encountered many obstacles.

159
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:04,220
Brother,

160
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,660
this has been tough.

161
00:08:06,810 --> 00:08:08,060
Exactly.

162
00:08:12,620 --> 00:08:14,060
They're so pitiful.

163
00:08:15,380 --> 00:08:17,460
They just wanted to steal some Wushan.

164
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:19,740
Did I go too far?

165
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:22,700
I'm a little regretful...

166
00:08:23,700 --> 00:08:27,140
regretful that I wasn't harsher.

167
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,420
If I knew it was going to be this fun,

168
00:08:29,460 --> 00:08:30,940
I would have set up more levels of traps.

169
00:08:34,460 --> 00:08:34,860
Let's go.

170
00:08:35,299 --> 00:08:36,100
What a pity.

171
00:08:52,980 --> 00:08:53,890
This must be delicious.

172
00:09:06,340 --> 00:09:06,900
Brother,

173
00:09:08,380 --> 00:09:10,660
why does the Wushan have such a stench?

174
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:12,540
It's similar to the stench in the latrine.

175
00:09:12,660 --> 00:09:13,860
That stench.

176
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:14,540
Is it?

177
00:09:14,580 --> 00:09:15,220
A little.

178
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:17,460
Think about your body odor.

179
00:09:17,700 --> 00:09:18,740
Stop talking and eat quickly.

180
00:09:22,980 --> 00:09:23,380
Brother,

181
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:26,580
did you hear something?

182
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:27,900
Why are you so...

183
00:09:28,580 --> 00:09:29,340
Fine, let's go.

184
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:31,940
I heard something.

185
00:09:33,420 --> 00:09:33,850
Hurry.

186
00:09:35,460 --> 00:09:37,220
It's time for my performance.

187
00:09:39,980 --> 00:09:42,420
How dare you break into Xuanqi Mountain at this late hour

188
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:44,100
and eat our only Wushan?

189
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,700
Spit it out!

190
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:47,260
Stop right there now!

191
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:50,860
Stop right there!

192
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:54,650
Let's go!

193
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:01,780
Bad news!

194
00:10:02,010 --> 00:10:05,020
The only real Wushan was stolen by the Black Wind's Double Tyrants!

195
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:06,060
What?

196
00:10:06,380 --> 00:10:07,220
I was guarding here all night.

197
00:10:07,420 --> 00:10:08,460
They actually stole it?

198
00:10:08,780 --> 00:10:09,170
What?

199
00:10:09,660 --> 00:10:12,380
How dare the Black Wind's Double Tyrants act so selfishly

200
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:13,940
and steal the Wu-Wu-Wushan?

201
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:16,260
W-W-Where are th-they?

202
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,180
They went that way. Go after them!

203
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:20,580
H-H-Hurry! Go after them!

204
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:21,620
Catch them!

205
00:10:21,620 --> 00:10:21,980
Go!

206
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:22,500
Go!

207
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,580
Brother.

208
00:10:33,940 --> 00:10:36,460
I feel like my inner energy is swirling

209
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:37,420
fiercely and vigorously.

210
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:39,420
I can fight for three days and three nights, nonstop.

211
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:41,330
Me too.

212
00:10:41,580 --> 00:10:43,380
Wushan really is a miraculous medicine.

213
00:10:43,620 --> 00:10:45,220
-Only those who've tried it will know. -They're here. Come on.

214
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:46,540
Hurry up.

215
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:49,940
Run!

216
00:10:49,980 --> 00:10:51,900
Wait, why do we need to run?

217
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:53,620
I don't know. It's my occupational habit acting up. Let's just run.

218
00:10:56,540 --> 00:10:58,260
-Wushan, where are you? -Hurry.

219
00:10:58,660 --> 00:10:59,500
Hurry up.

220
00:11:03,940 --> 00:11:05,100
Quickly.

221
00:11:06,380 --> 00:11:07,140
Keep up with them.

222
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:08,900
The Wushan rumor is fake.

223
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:10,740
There's no one real Wushan.

224
00:11:12,460 --> 00:11:13,540
Those idiots.

225
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:15,140
They were fooled by Li Chengxi.

226
00:11:19,780 --> 00:11:20,460
Your Majesty.

227
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,220
Useless!

228
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:25,660
How dare you instigate everyone to steal Wushan?

229
00:11:26,420 --> 00:11:27,980
You can't even accomplish a small task like this.

230
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:28,980
I'll call them back.

231
00:11:29,060 --> 00:11:29,650
No need.

232
00:11:30,260 --> 00:11:31,620
These people are of no use now.

233
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:34,220
I've set a trap on the mountain.

234
00:11:34,660 --> 00:11:36,780
You just need to lure Li Chengxi into the trap.

235
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:38,980
You must make sure he is hit hard this time

236
00:11:39,620 --> 00:11:41,010
and get the Book of Yueque.

237
00:11:43,530 --> 00:11:44,180
Yes.

238
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:49,620
Those bastards who coveted Wushan

239
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:51,060
are finally lured away.

240
00:11:51,700 --> 00:11:53,010
I can finally sleep well.

241
00:11:55,660 --> 00:11:56,500
But

242
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,660
who instigated this commotion?

243
00:11:59,180 --> 00:12:01,340
I've asked Zhi and Ruoyu to go down the mountain to investigate.

244
00:12:01,780 --> 00:12:02,940
We'll find out soon.

245
00:12:06,300 --> 00:12:07,220
Young Master.

246
00:12:12,580 --> 00:12:13,260
Young Master.

247
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:15,060
Didn't I ask you to go to Fengming Pavilion

248
00:12:15,100 --> 00:12:16,300
to buy information from Jin Badou?

249
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:17,620
How did you end up like this?

250
00:12:17,900 --> 00:12:18,460
Young Master.

251
00:12:18,820 --> 00:12:21,180
When we were heading down the mountain, we were ambushed by Wang Di

252
00:12:21,300 --> 00:12:22,780
before we could find Jin Badou.

253
00:12:23,260 --> 00:12:24,820
He insisted that the Wushan

254
00:12:24,980 --> 00:12:26,180
the Black Wind's Double Tyrants stole was fake.

255
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,180
He even interrogated us about the whereabouts of the real Wushan.

256
00:12:30,210 --> 00:12:32,500
Young Master, I'm sorry I failed at my job.

257
00:12:32,620 --> 00:12:34,540
This bastard saw through the trick.

258
00:12:37,300 --> 00:12:37,900
All right.

259
00:12:38,780 --> 00:12:40,140
You two, go back and rest first.

260
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:42,140
I'll head down the mountain and look for Jin Badou personally.

261
00:12:42,700 --> 00:12:43,700
-Okay. -Okay.

262
00:12:45,770 --> 00:12:48,180
Li Chengxi, I'll head down the mountain with you.

263
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:48,900
No.

264
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,420
Zhi and Ruoyu have just been ambushed.

265
00:12:51,700 --> 00:12:53,340
It's dangerous for you to head down the mountain now.

266
00:12:53,940 --> 00:12:55,940
I'm intending to head to Fengming Pavilion

267
00:12:55,940 --> 00:12:57,220
to buy information about the Teardrop Mole people anyway.

268
00:12:57,980 --> 00:12:59,340
If you don't take me with you, I'll have to go alone.

269
00:12:59,660 --> 00:13:01,860
Wouldn't that be more dangerous?

270
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:08,500
You lunatic.

271
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:10,540
What are you doing to me?

272
00:13:10,860 --> 00:13:11,860
Let go of me!

273
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,540
You lunatic, let go of me!

274
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:28,850
I made a mistake.

275
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:29,980
A mistake?

276
00:13:34,220 --> 00:13:35,580
I was going to pierce the Baihui acupoint.

277
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:37,220
Why did I pierce the Brain acupoint?

278
00:13:37,500 --> 00:13:38,100
This...

279
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:40,260
It's the alcohol's fault.

280
00:13:41,340 --> 00:13:42,780
It's the alcohol's fault.

281
00:13:42,820 --> 00:13:44,340
What will happen to me now?

282
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:49,980
Don't worry. Nothing will happen.

283
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:55,020
The Baihui acupoint can enhance your hearing and sight.

284
00:13:55,340 --> 00:13:56,860
The Brain acupoint

285
00:13:57,650 --> 00:13:58,900
can make you delirious,

286
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,100
foam at the mouth,

287
00:14:00,260 --> 00:14:01,940
and paralyze your brain.

288
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,820
It's okay. It's useless for you to have a brain anyway.

289
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:12,700
You...

290
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:21,660
It seems that I did pierce the right acupoint.

291
00:14:21,660 --> 00:14:22,180
Really?

292
00:14:22,900 --> 00:14:23,780
Yes, I saw it wrongly.

293
00:14:25,020 --> 00:14:25,780
It's all your fault.

294
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,260
Stop staring at me.

295
00:14:28,060 --> 00:14:30,300
I get nervous when you stare at me.

296
00:14:30,620 --> 00:14:32,580
My hands tremble when I'm nervous.

297
00:14:32,970 --> 00:14:34,180
Then, it becomes easy to make mistakes.

298
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:47,780
I forgot to tell you.

299
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,100
I just pierced 49 of your acupoints.

300
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:53,100
That's my own special technique, the Ultimate Seven Steps of...

301
00:14:56,060 --> 00:14:56,860
Death.

302
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:00,260
I think I've already taken six steps.

303
00:15:00,420 --> 00:15:02,020
So if you take another step,

304
00:15:02,900 --> 00:15:04,980
you'll bleed from all 7 orifices.

305
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,180
Bleed from all 7 orifices?

306
00:15:10,370 --> 00:15:11,650
You'll be dead.

307
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:12,820
Really?

308
00:15:14,340 --> 00:15:14,860
Don't move.

309
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:17,580
What do you mean?

310
00:15:18,900 --> 00:15:19,900
Where are you going?

311
00:15:20,980 --> 00:15:21,700
You lunatic!

312
00:15:22,260 --> 00:15:23,260
Help me fix this.

313
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:25,940
You're not allowed to leave, you lunatic!

314
00:15:47,020 --> 00:15:47,620
Watch out!

315
00:15:55,460 --> 00:15:56,060
Watch out!

316
00:16:01,250 --> 00:16:01,890
Tang Buyan.

317
00:16:14,540 --> 00:16:15,130
Are you okay?

318
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:16,460
Let me take you to treat your wound.

319
00:16:17,580 --> 00:16:19,500
Miss Tang!

320
00:16:42,780 --> 00:16:43,420
Pardon me.

321
00:16:56,100 --> 00:16:56,660
It hurts.

322
00:16:57,460 --> 00:16:58,100
It hurts.

323
00:17:26,810 --> 00:17:27,740
It's so hot.

324
00:17:33,460 --> 00:17:34,540
It's so hot.

325
00:17:36,780 --> 00:17:38,260
Let go of me.

326
00:17:48,180 --> 00:17:50,380
Senior sister, I'm training.

327
00:17:55,740 --> 00:17:56,260
Yan.

328
00:18:02,860 --> 00:18:06,620
Senior sister, I'm tired from the training.

329
00:18:07,340 --> 00:18:09,740
Can I stop training?

330
00:18:12,940 --> 00:18:13,420
Okay.

331
00:18:14,860 --> 00:18:16,300
If you're tired,

332
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:18,060
you don't have to train.

333
00:18:30,980 --> 00:18:32,060
Senior sister,

334
00:18:32,610 --> 00:18:35,180
you haven't hugged me in a long time.

335
00:18:33,660 --> 00:18:36,760
♫The east wind blows through calm and good times♫

336
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,680
♫Making ripples♫

337
00:18:37,740 --> 00:18:41,260
Senior sister, your hug is so warm.

338

He was kind enough to treat my wound, yet I hit him.

I didn't mean to hit you.

I'm really fine.

Let's go.

416
00:22:21,460 --> 00:22:23,620
The physician said your blood vessel disease is progressing faster than expected.

417
00:22:25,460 --> 00:22:27,410
You won't be able to live past 25 years old.
