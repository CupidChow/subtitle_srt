00:01:05,420 --> 00:01:07,140
Why are you frowning?

6
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,130
It's pretty easy.

7
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:12,340
Physician Yan, do you have an idea?

8
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:13,260
Brother Li.

9
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:15,940
Since that girl likes you,

10
00:01:16,539 --> 00:01:19,580
why don't you play tricks to get some information.

11
00:01:20,289 --> 00:01:21,620
Just use your charms.

12
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:24,420
Even if it becomes true,

13
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:25,980
you won't suffer losses.

14
00:01:26,300 --> 00:01:26,980
Am I right,

15
00:01:27,010 --> 00:01:27,660
Miss Tang?

16
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:29,620
Yes!

17
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:34,660
No, no, no.

18
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:35,460
Brother.

19
00:01:35,900 --> 00:01:36,620
What are charms?

20
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:38,740
Why don't you want to sell charms to that demoness?

21
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:39,860
So?

22
00:01:40,300 --> 00:01:41,780
Why don't you sell your charms instead of your brother?

23
00:01:44,020 --> 00:01:44,740
But

24
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,100
do you have charms?

25
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:48,539
Why don't I have them?

26
00:01:48,850 --> 00:01:49,820
I have whatever my brother has.

27
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:51,060
You are quite confident.

28
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:53,020
But you are not the one

29
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,700
she likes.

30
00:01:57,140 --> 00:01:57,820
Enough.

31
00:01:58,180 --> 00:01:59,780
None of you need to sell your charms.

32
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:00,660
I'll do it.

33
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:06,060
I mean,

34
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,340
with my intelligence

35
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,919
and my eloquent tongue,

36
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:12,060
I believe I can definitely convince her.

37
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:15,570
Just wait for my good news.

00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:27,900
It's glamorous.

Manager Shen.

42
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:38,270
Chief Tang came to see me...

43
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,630
Is it because Dear Li has agreed to the marriage?

44
00:02:43,270 --> 00:02:44,450
Chief Shen.

45
00:02:44,740 --> 00:02:45,920
What happened last time

46
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,470
was really just an accident.

47
00:02:47,890 --> 00:02:50,500
Li Chengxi has no intention to get married now.

48
00:02:50,790 --> 00:02:51,460
Think about it.

49
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:54,400
Love can't be forced.

50
00:02:55,160 --> 00:02:56,460
I have to try it

51
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:58,270
to know whether he will love me or not.

52
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,960
I'm afraid he is too strong-minded,

53
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:03,350
you can't force him even if you want to.

54
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:05,450
In my opinion,

55
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:09,610
nothing is more reliable than money.

56
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:11,450
I'm willing to

57
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:12,840
pay double for the news this time.

58
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:15,740
Five times.

59
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:17,670
Five times the price.

60
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,730
You're asking for a lot, Chief Tang.

61
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:22,710
But the last thing Fengming Pavilion needs

62
00:03:22,710 --> 00:03:23,970
is money.

63
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:26,110
What I need

64
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:27,960
is a unique handsome young man

65
00:03:27,960 --> 00:03:29,760
like Dear Li.

66
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:36,230
At this point,

67
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:38,579
I have nothing to hide.

68
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:40,730
To be honest,

69
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:43,460
Li Chengxi

70
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:45,890
only has a handsome face,

71
00:03:46,270 --> 00:03:47,910
he is actually

72
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:49,710
very unbearable.

73
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:53,579
He

74
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:55,890
has super severe OCD.

75
00:03:56,350 --> 00:03:57,860
Everything has to be in pairs.

76
00:03:58,160 --> 00:03:59,250
He is a quibbler.

77
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:00,470
Besides,

78
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,600
he is

79
00:04:01,810 --> 00:04:03,110
indifferent.

80
00:04:03,830 --> 00:04:05,630
He always keeps a stiff face

81
00:04:06,340 --> 00:04:08,020
and makes people shudder.

82
00:04:08,190 --> 00:04:09,280
He even uses emotional abuse.

83
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:11,510
What's wrong with OCD?

84
00:04:12,520 --> 00:04:14,280
As long as Dear Li likes it,

85
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:16,050
I'll buy two portions of everything I buy.

86
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:17,850
I can even change the servants

87
00:04:18,610 --> 00:04:19,950
into twins.

88
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,560
Besides,

89
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:25,120
the colder a man is,

90
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:27,680
the more I want to conquer him.

91
00:04:30,580 --> 00:04:31,880
Not only that,

92
00:04:32,130 --> 00:04:32,720
he...

93
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:33,560
He

94
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:36,120
is brutal.

95
00:04:36,630 --> 00:04:38,050
He loves to hit women.

96
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:40,830
Really?

97
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,130
Yes!

98
00:04:42,460 --> 00:04:43,810
The closer their relationship is,

99
00:04:43,810 --> 00:04:45,240
the crueler he is.

100
00:04:45,490 --> 00:04:46,500
If he is happy,

101
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,050
he'll slap on your face.

102
00:04:48,470 --> 00:04:49,560
If he is unhappy,

103
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:50,950
he'll kick you.

104
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:52,580
We women

105
00:04:53,090 --> 00:04:53,840
don't have to

106
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:56,280
suffer like this,

107
00:04:56,950 --> 00:04:57,500
right?

108
00:04:59,930 --> 00:05:01,660
I finally found a man like him!

109
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,760
I love him so much.

110
00:05:04,090 --> 00:05:05,310
When we get married,

111
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,950
I'll lock him up in the room

112
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,960
and let him beat me every day.

113
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:11,360
Oh my god.

114
00:05:11,780 --> 00:05:14,260
The masochist enjoys being oppressed.

115
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:15,520
I don't believe it.

116
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,320
Even if a woman can stand a violent man,

117
00:05:17,320 --> 00:05:18,540
can she endure a nauseous man?

118
00:05:19,040 --> 00:05:20,850
He... He's very sloppy.

119
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:22,490
Yes, and he's very dirty.

120
00:05:22,740 --> 00:05:24,710
He takes it as a bath when falling into the ditch.

121
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:26,730
He never wipes it when he goes to the toilet.

122
00:05:27,230 --> 00:05:27,610
He...

123
00:05:27,950 --> 00:05:28,410
His

124
00:05:29,290 --> 00:05:30,510
feet stink.

125
00:05:30,890 --> 00:05:32,740
He snores, grinds his teeth and even farts

126
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:34,830
when sleeping.

127
00:05:35,040 --> 00:05:36,050
And he doesn't wash his clothes

128
00:05:36,350 --> 00:05:37,980
for half a month.

129
00:05:39,370 --> 00:05:41,640
What a tasteful man!

130
00:05:45,750 --> 00:05:46,300
But

131
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:48,650
how do you know that?

132
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:51,890
Do you like him?

133
00:05:55,250 --> 00:05:55,830
I...

134
00:05:57,770 --> 00:06:00,500
Manager Shen, what are you thinking?

135
00:06:01,250 --> 00:06:02,720
Dear Li is so excellent.

136
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:05,030
You lied to me about how unbearable he was.

137
00:06:05,540 --> 00:06:07,090
You don't want us to get married.

138
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,020
Do you like him?

139
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,090
How is that possible?

140
00:06:12,300 --> 00:06:13,980
Why would I ask for abuse?

141
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:16,710
Besides, he's not the Destined One.

142
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,300
There's no way I like him.

143
00:06:18,890 --> 00:06:20,020
You don't like him

144
00:06:20,530 --> 00:06:22,000
or you can't like him?

145
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:23,680
Chief Tang,

146
00:06:24,140 --> 00:06:25,950
I know you can only marry the Destined One

147
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:27,750
because of your blood problem.

148
00:06:28,550 --> 00:06:29,890
But even so,

149
00:06:30,310 --> 00:06:31,700
can you really resist his charms

150
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:34,770
seeing each other day and night?

151
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:38,340
What are you talking about?

152
00:06:39,130 --> 00:06:40,480
Li Chengxi and I

153
00:06:40,730 --> 00:06:42,070
are companions in misfortune.

154
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:43,080
We're brothers.

155
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:46,650
In that case,

156
00:06:47,159 --> 00:06:48,040
why should you ruin

157
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:49,680
your brother's good marriage?

158
00:06:50,350 --> 00:06:51,020
How about this?

159
00:06:51,780 --> 00:06:53,250
You help me chase Li Chengxi.

160
00:06:54,040 --> 00:06:54,800
I

161
00:06:55,180 --> 00:06:56,140
will give you the information

162
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:58,409
about Teardrop Mole people for free after the thing is done.

163
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:00,340
We can benefit each other.

164
00:07:00,810 --> 00:07:01,480
What do you think?

165
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:03,410
This...

166
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,230
How about this?

167
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,090
You only need to do three things for me.

168
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:12,860
After these three things are done,

169
00:07:12,940 --> 00:07:14,870
I will give you the information about Teardrop Mole people

170
00:07:15,380 --> 00:07:17,650
no matter whether I can get married with Dear Li or not.

171
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:19,160
At the same time,

172
00:07:19,410 --> 00:07:21,850
I will also tell the news of the person with ancient script

173
00:07:22,690 --> 00:07:23,360
to him.

174
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:26,510
If Shen Yi can't marry him,

175
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,890
we can get the news.

176
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:29,320
If they can get married,

177
00:07:29,320 --> 00:07:29,910
I can help my brother

178
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:31,760
accomplish the most important event of his life

179
00:07:32,180 --> 00:07:33,440
and we can still get the news.

180
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:35,920
It's a good deal.

181
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:37,930
Why am I hesitating?

182
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:41,750
I promise you.

183
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:44,150
But we have to make three rules.

184
00:07:45,870 --> 00:07:46,290
First,

185
00:07:46,790 --> 00:07:48,050
not killing.

186
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:48,810
Second,

187
00:07:49,310 --> 00:07:50,610
I won't do anything against justice.

188
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:51,960
Third,

189
00:07:54,020 --> 00:07:55,820
don't hurt Li Chengxi.

190
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,340
If you agree to these three conditions,

191
00:07:58,930 --> 00:07:59,640
I'll help you.

192
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:01,030
Okay.

193
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:02,790
It's a deal then.

194
00:08:03,890 --> 00:08:05,020
But

195
00:08:05,190 --> 00:08:06,240
you must promise

196
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,130
not to tell Dear Li.

197
00:08:08,760 --> 00:08:10,060
Otherwise,

198
00:08:10,270 --> 00:08:11,070
the agreement will be invalid.

199
00:08:12,500 --> 00:08:13,630
Don't worry.

200
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:14,300
I...

201
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:16,990
I dare not tell him.

202
00:08:21,860 --> 00:08:22,950
So,

203
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,020
the first thing I ask you to do for me is

204
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,190
is to let Dear Li live in Fengming Pavilion.

205
00:08:51,260 --> 00:08:51,890
What do you think?

206
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:53,320
Did she give you a hard time?

207
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:07,050
Shen Yi

208
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:09,150
is really tough.

209
00:09:09,700 --> 00:09:10,160
However,

210
00:09:10,710 --> 00:09:12,130
who am I?

211
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:14,650
I'm a good talker,

212
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:15,620
and I'm eloquent.

213
00:09:15,910 --> 00:09:18,980
I enlightened her with affection and made her understand with reason.

214
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:19,860
Finally,

215
00:09:19,990 --> 00:09:21,250
she reluctantly agreed.

216
00:09:21,460 --> 00:09:23,850
We can forget about the wedding for now.

217
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:24,650
We can also discuss about

218
00:09:24,980 --> 00:09:26,200
the news later.

219
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,690
You talked big before,

220
00:09:29,810 --> 00:09:30,400
but

221
00:09:30,530 --> 00:09:32,000
you didn't get any news.

222
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:39,260
Where did you fall into?

223
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,720
Crazy bastard, how dare you mess with me?

224
00:09:44,980 --> 00:09:46,570
Needling or dressing?

225
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:48,040
Choose one of them.

226
00:09:48,210 --> 00:09:49,430
I won't choose anything.

227
00:09:49,430 --> 00:09:50,140
Neither?

228
00:09:50,140 --> 00:09:51,320
Then I'll do both.

229
00:09:51,490 --> 00:09:51,950
Brother!

230
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:52,410
Xue!

231
00:09:52,790 --> 00:09:53,250
Don't mess around.

232
00:09:53,840 --> 00:09:54,760
I'm messing around?

233
00:09:55,560 --> 00:09:56,060
Yan.

234
00:09:56,440 --> 00:09:58,880
Please apply it evenly.

235
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:00,390
No problem.

236
00:10:00,850 --> 00:10:01,980
Crazy bastard.

237
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:06,600
This time,

238
00:10:06,860 --> 00:10:08,660
I still have some progress.

239
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:11,100
I have successfully persuaded Shen Yi

240
00:10:11,390 --> 00:10:12,900
to let us live in Fengming Pavilion.

241
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:13,870
What?

242
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:16,140
We are going to live with that demoness?

243
00:10:16,680 --> 00:10:17,730
I...

244
00:10:21,010 --> 00:10:22,610
This is my plan.

245
00:10:23,070 --> 00:10:24,330
It's a stalling tactic.

246
00:10:24,750 --> 00:10:25,460
Do you understand?

247
00:10:26,470 --> 00:10:28,320
We can only get the news

248
00:10:28,700 --> 00:10:30,840
if we move in first.

249
00:10:35,460 --> 00:10:36,090
It's okay.

250
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:37,980
You agreed?

251
00:10:38,610 --> 00:10:39,990
I'll move to Fengming Pavilion tomorrow.

252
00:10:42,220 --> 00:10:42,680
Ruoyu.

253
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:45,030
Go to other places and ask around.

254
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:47,050
We can't just rely on Fengming Pavilion.

255
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:47,930
Yes.

256
00:11:03,010 --> 00:11:04,100
This is the place

257
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:05,950
our manager specially selected for you.

258
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:08,430
It's close to Manager's bedroom.

259
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:09,980
There are two rooms

260
00:11:10,400 --> 00:11:11,110
on this side.

261
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:12,880
Look over there.

262
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:14,310
There are two rooms as well.

263
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:16,870
Please choose at will.

264
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:18,380
Call me if you need anything.

265
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:19,770
Okay, go ahead.

266
00:11:21,570 --> 00:11:22,370
In that case,

267
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:25,480
Xue and I will stay in two rooms on this side,

268
00:11:26,150 --> 00:11:28,500
and Brother Li and Miss Tang will stay in two rooms on that side.

269
00:11:28,840 --> 00:11:29,340
What do you think?

270
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:31,190
Why should I live with you?

271
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:32,950
Because I am the one

272
00:11:33,370 --> 00:11:35,090
who keeps you alive now.

273
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:36,730
From morning to night,

274
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,710
you need acupuncture and medicine,

275
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:41,390
and you also need to apply ointment and soak in the medicine bath.

276
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:43,120
You can't miss even one of them.

277
00:11:43,790 --> 00:11:44,630
Would you ask your brother

278
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,850
if he would let you waste all the previous efforts?

279
00:11:46,980 --> 00:11:47,440
Brother.

280
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:49,160
Don't listen to this crazy man.

281
00:11:49,420 --> 00:11:50,890
He just wants to play tricks on me.

282
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:53,030
But your condition has indeed improved.

283
00:11:53,530 --> 00:11:55,170
It's all thanks to Brother Yan.

284
00:11:56,430 --> 00:11:56,890
By the way,

285
00:11:57,520 --> 00:11:58,030
Xue,

286
00:11:58,820 --> 00:12:00,000
how are you doing with Book of Yueque?

287
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:01,090
Have you made any breakthroughs?

288
00:12:01,550 --> 00:12:02,810
If you drive this crazy man away,

289
00:12:02,810 --> 00:12:03,910
I'll master it in three days.

290
00:12:04,830 --> 00:12:05,800
If you don't want others

291
00:12:06,010 --> 00:12:07,310
to treat you like a patient,

292
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:08,860
just focus on cultivating Book of Yueque.

293
00:12:09,740 --> 00:12:10,250
Brother Yan.

294
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:11,970
I'm counting on you

295
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:13,440
before Xue masters it.

296
00:12:18,270 --> 00:12:18,940
This way, please.

297
00:12:23,900 --> 00:12:24,360
By the way,

298
00:12:25,110 --> 00:12:26,880
we can't delay getting the news any longer.

299
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:28,520
We need to find out as soon as possible.

300
00:12:29,690 --> 00:12:30,570
In that case,

301
00:12:30,910 --> 00:12:32,930
be nice to Shen Yi.

302
00:12:33,350 --> 00:12:35,400
Try to get close to her

303
00:12:35,870 --> 00:12:36,580
and chat with her.

304
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:38,680
Maybe when she's happy...

305
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:40,780
Why are you leaving?

306
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,350
Who cares?

307
00:13:04,680 --> 00:13:05,890
Li Chengxi.

308
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,120
Once you enter my territory,

309
00:13:08,370 --> 00:13:10,770
just wait to be conquered.

310
00:13:16,520 --> 00:13:19,040
[Fengming Pavilion]

311
00:14:01,500 --> 00:14:02,210
Dear Li.

312
00:14:10,740 --> 00:14:12,550
Don't go, Dear Li.

313
00:14:43,500 --> 00:14:45,180
Manager Shen, don't waste your time.

314
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:48,160
Don't you want the news, Dear Li?

315
00:14:49,420 --> 00:14:50,850
You can ask me one question

316
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,860
as long as you hold me up.

317
00:14:53,490 --> 00:14:55,220
I'll tell you everything I know.

318
00:15:12,770 --> 00:15:14,370
The way you hold me up

319
00:15:14,530 --> 00:15:15,960
is really special.

320
00:15:16,420 --> 00:15:17,180
Can't I?

321
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:18,690
Of course you can.

322
00:15:19,240 --> 00:15:20,790
You are so handsome,

323
00:15:21,090 --> 00:15:21,970
of course you can do anything.

324
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,940
Where is the person

325
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:25,410
who knows ancient script now?

326
00:15:25,660 --> 00:15:26,590
He is...

327
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,280
I changed my mind.

328
00:15:30,280 --> 00:15:31,630
I don't want to say it anymore.

329
00:15:32,010 --> 00:15:32,850
Dear Li.

330
00:15:33,140 --> 00:15:34,820
Do you feel very angry now

331
00:15:34,820 --> 00:15:35,700
and want to hit someone?

332
00:15:36,080 --> 00:15:36,630
Come on.

333
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:38,310
Release your nature.

334
00:15:38,770 --> 00:15:39,400
Torture me!

335
00:15:39,610 --> 00:15:40,200
Hit me!

336
00:15:40,700 --> 00:15:41,880
I won't fight back.

337
00:15:46,370 --> 00:15:48,720
I told you Li Chengxi was not easy to deal with.

338
00:15:49,140 --> 00:15:50,700
But you didn't listen to me.

339
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:51,870
Great.

340
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,800
Now you've messed up.

341
00:15:53,220 --> 00:15:53,640
Yes.

342
00:15:54,220 --> 00:15:55,360
That's the feeling.

343
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:57,250
I really like it.

344
00:16:14,470 --> 00:16:15,050
You're here.

345
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:16,650
I've been waiting for you for a long time.

346
00:16:22,610 --> 00:16:23,290
I know.

347
00:16:23,750 --> 00:16:25,720
You want to ask about the progress between Li Chengxi and me, right?

348
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:32,570
Li Chengxi

349
00:16:32,950 --> 00:16:34,630
is far more difficult to deal with than I thought.

350
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:37,520
It seems that if I want to take him down,

351
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,370
I have to

352
00:16:39,370 --> 00:16:40,800
use my special skills.

353
00:16:42,270 --> 00:16:42,940
I know.

354
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:44,750
You want to know what I'll do, right?

355
00:16:46,550 --> 00:16:48,190
As the owner of Fengming Pavilion,

356
00:16:48,440 --> 00:16:49,830
I'm best at

357
00:16:49,830 --> 00:16:50,880
collecting information, of course.

358
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:52,260
Know yourself and your enemy,

359
00:16:52,850 --> 00:16:54,240
and you can defeat them at one stroke.

360
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:57,470
I know.

361
00:16:58,400 --> 00:17:00,540
You want me to send Jin Badou

362
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,470
to investigate Li Chengxi's past, right?

363
00:17:05,540 --> 00:17:07,130
Manager, what can I do for you?

364
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:12,550
I know.

365
00:17:13,520 --> 00:17:15,569
You want to know why I don't ask Jin Badou to do that.

366
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:18,089
Jin Badou's investigation can only be superficial,

367
00:17:18,510 --> 00:17:20,359
and can't go deep into Li Chengxi's heart.

368
00:17:23,089 --> 00:17:24,010
So,

369
00:17:24,770 --> 00:17:25,859
this matter

370
00:17:27,500 --> 00:17:28,590
can only depend on you.

371
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:33,970
Manager Shen,

372
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:37,870
we don't have to make it troublesome.

373
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:39,430
It's tiring.

374
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:43,170
Just tell me what you need me to do.

375
00:17:52,150 --> 00:17:52,780
This is

376
00:17:53,550 --> 00:17:55,430
my list of 100 questions to be answered sincerely.

377
00:17:56,520 --> 00:17:57,870
Answering the above questions

378
00:17:58,030 --> 00:17:59,550
can deeply analyze

379
00:17:59,550 --> 00:18:00,890
the most unknown

380
00:18:01,060 --> 00:18:03,660
and the truest side of a person's heart.

381
00:18:08,070 --> 00:18:08,830
So,

382
00:18:09,460 --> 00:18:11,390
the second thing I ask you to do is

383
00:18:12,020 --> 00:18:14,120
to let Li Chengxi fill out these questionnaires.

384
00:18:14,750 --> 00:18:16,850
When I control his heart,

385
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:19,700
he won't be able to escape from me.

386
00:18:38,940 --> 00:18:39,910
Good skill.

387
00:18:40,830 --> 00:18:41,460
Li Chengxi.

388
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:44,400
You must be bored to practice alone here.

389
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:45,830
I'll practice with you.

390
00:18:56,410 --> 00:18:57,040
Li Chengxi.

391
00:18:57,670 --> 00:19:00,230
What kind of girls' hairstyle do you like?

392
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:02,330
Why do you suddenly ask this?

393
00:19:03,890 --> 00:19:05,230
Just a chat.

394
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:10,480
Just a little braid on one side.

395
00:19:11,070 --> 00:19:12,200
Just a little braid on one side.

396
00:19:12,790 --> 00:19:15,770
What kind of clothes do you like for girls?

397
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:17,330
Light yellow skirt.

398
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:19,680
Light yellow skirt.

399
00:19:23,080 --> 00:19:25,810
What type of girl do you like?

400
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,010
The seductive one,

401
00:19:32,780 --> 00:19:34,840
the cute one,

402
00:19:37,020 --> 00:19:39,120
or the tough one?

403
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:45,300
Full of foolishness.

404
00:19:48,150 --> 00:19:48,870
Do you like

405
00:19:49,870 --> 00:19:51,300
silly girls?

406
00:19:58,270 --> 00:20:01,340
Then when was your first kiss?

407
00:20:01,050 --> 00:20:04,090

I didn't sleep all night yesterday

439
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:25,840
to specially develop this invincible armor.

440

It doesn't matter whether it's an acupuncture treatment

Nice armor.

446
00:21:40,830 --> 00:21:41,840
Just so so.

447
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,120
It's just right

448
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:46,970
for our smoking therapy today.

449
00:21:47,930 --> 00:21:49,230

It's strange.

Why does this flower bloom suddenly?

453
00:22:05,570 --> 00:22:06,620
Anything else you want to ask?

454
00:22:14,980 --> 00:22:16,910
If you really like someone,

455
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:18,670
will you confess your love

456
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:19,980
or protect her quietly?

457
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:58,700
It's so strange.

458
00:22:59,750 --> 00:23:00,420
Why is my heart

459
00:23:00,810 --> 00:23:02,980
beating so fast?

00:23:04,540 --> 00:23:05,500

This lunatic is choking me to death.

463
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:10,540
Take off your mask.

464
00:23:10,540 --> 00:23:11,090
I ask you to take it off for me.

466
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:12,560

468

Xue.

469
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:16,340
Take it off for me.

470

Xue.

471
00:23:21,330 --> 00:23:22,890
As long as you stop resisting treatment,

472
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:24,950
I believe Brother Yan won't do this to you again.

473
00:23:25,160 --> 00:23:26,080
Don't believe him.

474
00:23:26,710 --> 00:23:27,800
You're not on my side anymore.

475
00:23:29,690 --> 00:23:30,620
I can't stay here anymore.

478
00:23:39,140 --> 00:23:40,020
I didn't expect

479
00:23:40,280 --> 00:23:42,040
your private interaction with Li

480
00:23:42,540 --> 00:23:43,680
were so...

481
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:45,650
I was about to tell you.

482
00:23:45,990 --> 00:23:46,620
Just now,

483
00:23:46,870 --> 00:23:48,630
I was almost hurt by Li Chengxi.

484
00:23:48,970 --> 00:23:49,390
Then,

485
00:23:49,940 --> 00:23:51,660
my heartbeat became abnormal.

486
00:23:54,680 --> 00:23:56,570
Why do I feel my heart is still beating fast?

487
00:23:57,660 --> 00:23:59,050
Did I get hurt

488
00:23:59,050 --> 00:24:00,180
by Li Chengfeng's martial arts?

489
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:02,120
Physician Yan, please check it for me.

490
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:20,590
Things are not going well.

491
00:24:21,010 --> 00:24:21,810
What's wrong?

492
00:24:21,980 --> 00:24:22,820
Is it serious?

493
00:24:25,170 --> 00:24:25,930
I'm out of wine.

494
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:28,830
Forget about the wine.

495
00:24:28,990 --> 00:24:31,260
I'm asking about my illness.

496
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:34,410
Your illness

497
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,050
a mental disease.

498
00:24:37,140 --> 00:24:38,150
There's no cure yet

499
00:24:38,990 --> 00:24:41,890
We need to wait for a powerful medicine.

500
00:24:42,350 --> 00:24:43,360
What powerful medicine?

501
00:24:44,160 --> 00:24:45,710
When can it be cured?

502
00:24:46,340 --> 00:24:48,860
You'll know when the time comes.

503
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,550
Physician Yan.

504
00:24:51,710 --> 00:24:53,060
I'm going to buy wine.

505

[Li Chengxi's Preference Questionnaire]

506
00:25:06,750 --> 00:25:08,220
Now I see.

507
00:25:08,930 --> 00:25:11,030
Dear Li may look cold,

508
00:25:11,960 --> 00:25:14,770
but deep down in his heart,

509
00:25:15,400 --> 00:25:16,580
he is very enthusiastic.

510
00:25:18,930 --> 00:25:21,870
He doesn't open his heart easily.

511
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,560
But once someone goes in,

512
00:25:25,230 --> 00:25:26,780
he will lose control

513
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,170
and burst out all his passion.

514
00:25:29,980 --> 00:25:31,190
I am right.

515
00:25:31,700 --> 00:25:32,160
This

516
00:25:32,750 --> 00:25:34,970
is the man I'm destined to be with.

517
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,310
How did you analyze that?

518
00:25:42,740 --> 00:25:43,540
I've decided.

519
00:25:44,590 --> 00:25:46,770
You can create a romantic date

520
00:25:47,280 --> 00:25:49,290
based on these Questionnaires.

521
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:54,670
Okay.

522
00:25:55,220 --> 00:25:55,800
But

523
00:25:55,970 --> 00:25:56,900
this is the last thing

524
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,950
I do for you.

525
00:25:58,870 --> 00:25:59,840
Don't worry.

526
00:26:00,890 --> 00:26:02,270
Dear Li

527
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:04,620
can't escape from me.

528
00:26:08,780 --> 00:26:09,540
Jin!

529
00:26:10,080 --> 00:26:10,800
Manager.

530
00:26:10,920 --> 00:26:11,930
What can I do for you?

531
00:26:12,520 --> 00:26:14,450
Take Chief Tang to Lingyue Pavilion

532
00:26:14,620 --> 00:26:15,840
and set up my date site.

533
00:26:16,890 --> 00:26:17,390
Remember,

534
00:26:18,150 --> 00:26:19,950
what Chief Tang said is my words.

535
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:22,090
I'll do as Chief Tang says.

536
00:26:23,310 --> 00:26:24,150
Also,

537
00:26:24,820 --> 00:26:26,670
if you screw this up,

538
00:26:27,300 --> 00:26:29,400
then you can quit your position.

539
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:32,300
Yes, Manager.

540
00:26:34,440 --> 00:26:34,990
Please.

541
00:26:36,790 --> 00:26:37,340
Give me a hand.

542
00:26:37,550 --> 00:26:38,140
Okay.

543
00:26:39,400 --> 00:26:39,990
Be careful.

544
00:26:41,160 --> 00:26:41,750
Come on.

545
00:26:44,730 --> 00:26:45,530
Put this over there.

546
00:26:45,610 --> 00:26:46,030
Okay.

547
00:26:47,170 --> 00:26:47,630
Not bad.

548
00:26:48,050 --> 00:26:48,550
Not bad.

549
00:26:51,240 --> 00:26:51,830
Remember,

550
00:26:52,290 --> 00:26:54,270
petals are signals.

551
00:26:54,690 --> 00:26:56,280
Once the signals are sent,

552
00:26:56,280 --> 00:26:57,670
the date will start immediately.

553
00:26:57,920 --> 00:26:59,560
Don't stop even if you make any mistakes.

554
00:26:59,770 --> 00:27:01,320
We must proceed with the whole process.

555
00:27:01,700 --> 00:27:02,710
Yes, Miss Tang.

556
00:27:02,830 --> 00:27:03,420
I'll listen to you.

557
00:27:05,270 --> 00:27:05,690
Also,

558
00:27:05,980 --> 00:27:08,590
don't let anyone ruin the date site.

559
00:27:09,890 --> 00:27:11,150
Send someone to tell Li Chengxi

560
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:13,580
to come to Lingyue Pavilion at nine p.m.

561
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:15,010
Tell him

562
00:27:16,310 --> 00:27:17,450
I have something to tell him.

563
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:18,790
Okay.

564
00:27:21,690 --> 00:27:22,190
My Lord.

565
00:27:22,820 --> 00:27:24,210
How is it going?

566
00:27:24,710 --> 00:27:26,770
The owner of Fengming Pavilion is very difficult to deal with.

567
00:27:27,320 --> 00:27:28,910
Li Chengxi hasn't made any progress yet.

568
00:27:29,710 --> 00:27:31,430
I've been spying on Fengming Pavilion these days.

569
00:27:32,610 --> 00:27:33,790
It's heavily guarded here.

570
00:27:34,210 --> 00:27:35,890
I don't want to alert them,

571
00:27:36,220 --> 00:27:37,270
so there's no progress yet.

572
00:27:37,650 --> 00:27:38,530
Go back and wait for my order.

573
00:27:38,700 --> 00:27:39,120
Yes.

574
00:27:40,720 --> 00:27:41,770
Get lost!

575
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:44,120
I said I wouldn't drink your stinky medicine.

576
00:27:51,510 --> 00:27:52,050
Who's there?

577
00:27:54,830 --> 00:27:55,620
Who's there?

578
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,280
No one is here.
