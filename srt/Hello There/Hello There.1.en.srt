Boss.

-Boss! -Boss!

7
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:18,060
-Boss! -Boss, what's wrong?

8
00:02:18,620 --> 00:02:20,100
Is it another outbreak of blood vessel disease?

9
00:02:20,300 --> 00:02:21,380
Did you wake up because of scare?

10
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:33,020
Luckily, it was just a dream.

11

Zhuang. Ba.

12
00:02:38,740 --> 00:02:40,260
How's the thing I asked you to do?

13
00:02:40,300 --> 00:02:41,780
Don't worry. It goes well.

14
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:57,200
Have some more.

15
00:03:07,460 --> 00:03:10,450
As the famous Young Mistress of the Tang Sect in Shu,

16
00:03:11,420 --> 00:03:13,740
I have a blood vessel issue.

17
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,579
If I can't find the destined one,

18
00:03:17,170 --> 00:03:20,100
I'll age quickly to death before 25.

19
00:03:20,380 --> 00:03:21,579
But I haven't achieved

20
00:03:21,579 --> 00:03:22,980
my ambition.

21
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:25,579
How can I be trampled by fate?

22
00:03:26,100 --> 00:03:27,900
My fate is controlled by me instead of God.

23
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:46,100
My destined one.

24
00:03:46,579 --> 00:03:47,940
I'm coming.

25
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:14,020
What the hell, Boss?

26
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:15,940
What new posture is this?

27
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:25,700
Bad news! The Tang Sect's female tyrant

28
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,940
is here to catch men again!

29
00:04:33,700 --> 00:04:35,380
Everyone, please don't be afraid.

30
00:04:35,860 --> 00:04:37,020
I only want him.

31
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:39,860
Others can just do what you need to do.

32
00:04:40,140 --> 00:04:41,860
You want us to abandon our friends?

33
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,260
Impossible.

34
00:04:47,420 --> 00:04:49,100
Impossible for us to disagree.

35
00:04:59,620 --> 00:05:00,780
Don't come over!

36

Don't come over!

Here, teardrop mole guy.

39

Let me give you a blood test.

40
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:12,500
Wait. You female tyrant.

41
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:14,620
In this way you can only get my body

42
00:05:14,660 --> 00:05:16,100
but not my heart.

43
00:05:20,980 --> 00:05:22,740
How dare you break my necklace?

44
00:05:23,460 --> 00:05:24,460
Keep it safe.

Aren't you good at running?

60
00:06:35,659 --> 00:06:36,220
I won't run anymore.

Isn't that fate?

What did you say?

81
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,100
I said you were looking for death.

If you don't take it in the easy way,

I didn't expect you really are something.

Do you want to go back with me

103

and be my wife?

104

Shameless!

105
00:11:07,740 --> 00:11:10,100
Don't you think I'd have a secret weapon

106
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:11,620
since I've been dominating in Shu for years?

107
00:11:12,220 --> 00:11:13,980
I'll show you what I've got!

108

Look! Darts!

109
00:11:24,580 --> 00:11:26,500
How dare you sprinkle the tickling powder on me!

I'll kill you.

114

It's too stiff.

Don't go.

Put me down!

119

Isn't that the female tyrant from Tang Sect?

120

-What are you looking at? -She is hung on a tree.

-What a shame. -That's right.

124

She's finally getting what was coming to her.

125
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:07,460
She deserves it.

126

Come back.

127
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:11,260
You embarrassed me.

Enjoy.

132
00:12:40,380 --> 00:12:41,340
Don't you think I'll forgive you

133
00:12:41,340 --> 00:12:42,180
with a couple of sugar snacks.

134
00:12:42,580 --> 00:12:43,370
Impossible.

135
00:12:44,900 --> 00:12:46,820
Li Chengxi, let me tell you.

136
00:12:47,370 --> 00:12:48,980
Unless you let me tie the rope...

137
00:12:50,380 --> 00:12:52,100
Either eat it or I'll tie you up.

138
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:55,700
It's not delicious at all.

139
00:12:56,140 --> 00:12:57,660
I just don't want to waste food.

140
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:08,220
Where are you going?

141
00:13:08,610 --> 00:13:09,650
Are you going to kill someone?

142
00:13:10,260 --> 00:13:11,740
Don't get in my way this time.

143
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,130
I told you that unless you're protecting yourself,

144
00:13:15,620 --> 00:13:16,540
you can't kill people.

145
00:13:16,540 --> 00:13:18,460
Then why did you take me with you out of the mountain if we can't kill people?

146
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:19,860
We're going to the Tang Sect

147
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:21,340
and find the Book of Yueque.

148
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:22,540
That's right.

149
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:24,260
Let's wipe out the Tang Sect

150
00:13:24,660 --> 00:13:25,820
and then get the Book of Yueque.

151
00:13:40,540 --> 00:13:42,890
Li Chengxi, if you tie me up again,

152
00:13:43,140 --> 00:13:44,500
I'll be really mad at you.

153
00:13:59,020 --> 00:14:00,220
Will Boss be okay?

154
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:01,220
Of course she will be fine.

155
00:14:10,540 --> 00:14:11,300
Doctor.

156
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:17,460
Doctor.

157
00:14:17,580 --> 00:14:19,980
The damage to Young Mistress Tang's body is worse than expected.

158
00:14:20,260 --> 00:14:22,300
The blood vessel issue has been induced in advance.

159
00:14:22,540 --> 00:14:25,260
I'm afraid she won't live to 25 years old.

160
00:14:26,700 --> 00:14:27,780
How does this happen?

161
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:29,860
What should we do?

162
00:14:31,100 --> 00:14:32,340
Is there a way to stabilize her condition?

163
00:14:32,420 --> 00:14:33,420
Forgive me for my incompetence.

164
00:14:33,620 --> 00:14:35,010
There is no cure.

165
00:14:35,340 --> 00:14:36,620
We can only let her rest well.

166
00:14:36,820 --> 00:14:37,940
Don't let her get too excited.

167
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:40,180
She definitely can't wear down her body too much.

168
00:14:40,490 --> 00:14:41,220
Otherwise...

169
00:14:42,370 --> 00:14:43,340
I'll take my leave.

170
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:52,940
Boss.

171
00:14:53,820 --> 00:14:55,140
Boss, you're awake.

00:14:56,420 --> 00:14:57,540
I thought...

173
00:14:59,140 --> 00:15:00,340
What did you think?

174
00:15:02,220 --> 00:15:04,020
If you hadn't held me back,

175
00:15:04,250 --> 00:15:05,980
I would have beaten them up.

176
00:15:07,140 --> 00:15:09,020
They made such a fool of me.

177
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:12,340
I must take revenge today.

178
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:14,970
Go and check

179
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,940
where that red guy and blue guy live.

180
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:18,700
Okay, we'll go right away.

181
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:19,420
Go.

182

Let's go.

Senior sister,

188

I was looking for my destined one.

189
00:15:44,860 --> 00:15:46,420
But Senior sister, let me tell you.

190
00:15:46,780 --> 00:15:48,610
I might have found him already.

191
00:15:52,260 --> 00:15:53,220
Listen to me.

192
00:15:53,740 --> 00:15:54,140
Well...

193
00:15:54,540 --> 00:15:55,780
Here's the thing.

194
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,460
On a dark night,

195
00:15:58,980 --> 00:16:00,500
the chickens were crowing and the dogs were barking.

196
00:16:08,140 --> 00:16:10,740
Although the process of our battle

197
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:12,370
was a bit intense,

198
00:16:12,900 --> 00:16:15,580
my sharp sixth sense told me

199
00:16:16,020 --> 00:16:20,420
that blue guy must be my destined one.

200
00:16:22,380 --> 00:16:23,180
Yan.

201
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:26,250
The Tang family's blood vessel issue has been there for centuries.

202
00:16:26,860 --> 00:16:28,580
It's not as easy to solve as you think.

203
00:16:28,820 --> 00:16:30,980
You'll be an adult in two months,

204
00:16:31,340 --> 00:16:32,540
and you can inherit the chief position.

205
00:16:35,140 --> 00:16:38,820
You just stay here and recuperate.

206
00:16:39,140 --> 00:16:40,060
Don't run around.

207
00:16:40,970 --> 00:16:42,850
If I can't find my destined one,

208
00:16:43,420 --> 00:16:45,060
I will age quickly to death before 25,

209
00:16:45,220 --> 00:16:47,660
just like my brother.

210
00:16:47,860 --> 00:16:49,860
It'll be a waste to be the chief.

211
00:16:57,060 --> 00:16:57,940
Senior sister,

212
00:16:59,620 --> 00:17:01,820
isn't it good enough that you are the deputy chief now?

213
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:03,340
Just be it forever.

214
00:17:03,980 --> 00:17:04,660
As for me,

215
00:17:04,900 --> 00:17:07,020
I'll focus on finding my destined one.

216
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:08,700
There are seven years left.

217
00:17:09,060 --> 00:17:10,700
I believe I will find him eventually.

218
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:13,060
The Tang Sect's blood vessel issue will be solved.

219

Yan,

220
00:17:15,780 --> 00:17:17,940
you're the only descendant of the Tang Sect now.

221
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:20,140
I can't let you take the risk anymore.

222
00:17:21,460 --> 00:17:22,540
As for those two,

223
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:25,329
we don't know who they are so they're dangerous.

224
00:17:25,780 --> 00:17:27,140
I'll find them for you.

225
00:17:28,020 --> 00:17:29,860
You just stay here and recuperate.

226
00:17:29,940 --> 00:17:31,210
Senior sister.

227

Don't be capricious.

228
00:17:47,460 --> 00:17:48,500
I hate you.

229
00:18:01,900 --> 00:18:03,300
Let me tell you.

230
00:18:03,940 --> 00:18:07,380
Today, I was the one who got bullied by the female tyrant.

231
00:18:08,420 --> 00:18:11,540
Tomorrow it will be your turn.

232

What's that sound?

233

Go and take a look.

Yes.

236

Zhuang, didn't I ask you to meet me up outside

237
00:18:55,060 --> 00:18:56,140
with the password?

238

By the way.

Why did you raise your hand?

243
00:19:33,220 --> 00:19:35,740
Great job, Zhuang. We're connected mentally.

244

There's someone over there. Go and have a look.

Where are you going?

249
00:20:18,220 --> 00:20:20,860
When did Zhuang's waist become so narrow?

250
00:20:58,900 --> 00:20:59,770
Mosquito.

251

Mosquito.

252

It's buzzing.

I'll use a hidden weapon to distract him.

Let's sneak out.

and tickle him?
