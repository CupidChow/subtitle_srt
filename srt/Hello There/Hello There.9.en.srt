What's your purpose?

69

that Wushan is a miraculous medicine?

71

What are you talking about?

72

I'm only here because I've also heard

that Wushan is miraculous.

74

There was a misunderstanding between us.

But treasure belongs to anyone

capable enough to get it.

You can't monopolize

78
00:03:31,340 --> 00:03:32,700
a treasure like Wushan.

79
00:03:32,900 --> 00:03:34,100
You won't confess?

80

I have an idea to make you confess.

I'll give you one last chance.

87

Say what?

00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:38,740
What is that?

103
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:41,860
Stay away from me.

104
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,540
I really don't want to use this.

105
00:04:45,659 --> 00:04:47,220
It's too cruel.

106
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:02,020
A little itchy.

107
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:03,460
A little itchy.

108
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:08,420
Itchy.

I'll confess.

Don't let me see you again.

Don't.

It's so itchy.

Untie me.

Don't go.

Untie me.

Is my hair white?

140
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:12,540
Actually,

141
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:14,340
it turned white this morning.

142
00:06:15,460 --> 00:06:16,260
But don't worry.

143
00:06:16,940 --> 00:06:17,940
Only two strands are white.

144
00:06:30,860 --> 00:06:31,660
Physician Yan.

145
00:06:32,540 --> 00:06:34,220
Is my blood vessel issue

146
00:06:34,220 --> 00:06:35,220
flaring up in advance?

147
00:06:35,740 --> 00:06:36,659
Can I be saved?

148
00:06:37,659 --> 00:06:38,220
Don't worry.

149
00:06:38,420 --> 00:06:39,140
It's just white hair.

150
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:39,980
Just pull it out.

151
00:06:42,650 --> 00:06:43,900
What? You don't want to pull it out?

152
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:45,580
Fine.

153
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:47,050
Make juice out of Wushan

154
00:06:47,220 --> 00:06:47,900
and dye it.

155
00:06:49,940 --> 00:06:50,300
No.

156
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:52,420
You mean my white hair

157
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,290
is permanent?

158
00:06:57,659 --> 00:06:58,700
Just kidding.

159
00:07:02,420 --> 00:07:03,500
Drink this and get some rest

160
00:07:03,940 --> 00:07:05,380
and it'll be back to normal.

161
00:07:06,170 --> 00:07:06,580
Really?

162
00:07:08,220 --> 00:07:09,140
That's a relief.

163
00:07:09,500 --> 00:07:10,300
Thank you, Physician Yan.

164
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:11,140
Go.

165
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:22,980
Is she

166
00:07:23,780 --> 00:07:24,500
really okay?

167
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:26,700
This time,

168
00:07:26,740 --> 00:07:29,660
I'm afraid her blood vessel disease has really flared up in advance.

169
00:07:30,940 --> 00:07:32,340
I can only suppress it temporarily.

170
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:35,300
I'm afraid

171
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:37,940
she can't live past 20 years old.

172
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:40,500
Twenty?

173
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:41,940
That means...

174
00:07:43,420 --> 00:07:44,460
You care so much about her.

175
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:46,260
Have you fallen in love with her?

176
00:07:50,260 --> 00:07:51,220
I've completed the first level

177
00:07:51,220 --> 00:07:52,220
of the Book of Yueque.

178
00:07:53,300 --> 00:07:53,820
But

179
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:55,860
there were no signs of possession after that.

180
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:57,820
Does this mean

181
00:07:58,540 --> 00:07:59,340
the Book of Yueque is effective?

182
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:01,500
It's useless to change the subject.

183
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:04,460
Looks like when you didn't come back last night,

184
00:08:04,900 --> 00:08:06,820
you and her did more than

185
00:08:07,460 --> 00:08:10,660
you needed to.

186
00:08:11,060 --> 00:08:12,140
This concerns Yan's reputation.

187
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:13,700
Physician Yan, please be careful with your words.

188
00:08:15,340 --> 00:08:16,260
You're even calling her Yan now,

189
00:08:16,260 --> 00:08:17,100
yet you say there's nothing?

190
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:18,700
Don't worry.

191
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:19,900
I won't tell anyone.

192
00:08:20,860 --> 00:08:21,460
Tell me.

193
00:08:29,860 --> 00:08:30,300
Okay.

194
00:08:31,780 --> 00:08:32,460
You said

195
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:34,700
you couldn't figure out

196
00:08:34,700 --> 00:08:35,620
the last sentence of the first level.

197
00:08:36,020 --> 00:08:37,140
Then how did you complete it?

198
00:08:37,809 --> 00:08:39,539
The last sentence in the Book of Yueque says

199
00:08:39,980 --> 00:08:41,299
that only the one you love

200
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:42,980
can help you practice this skill.

201
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:45,020
Yesterday, Yan and I were ambushed.

202
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:46,540
She got injured saving me.

203
00:08:47,180 --> 00:08:48,020
It all happened so quickly.

204
00:08:49,220 --> 00:08:50,610
I don't know how I completed the level.

205
00:08:53,180 --> 00:08:54,700
So you did fall in love with Miss Tang.

206
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:56,060
I didn't expect

207
00:08:56,260 --> 00:08:57,580
a robot like you

208
00:08:57,700 --> 00:08:58,900
to feel love too.

209
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,780
Unfortunately,

210
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:02,860
you are not her Destined One.

211
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:07,010
But it doesn't matter.

212
00:09:08,490 --> 00:09:09,580
There are still two years left.

213
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:11,460
It's still early to declare her blood vessel disease

214
00:09:11,540 --> 00:09:12,500
as incurable.

215
00:09:16,580 --> 00:09:17,500
Didn't you say

216
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:19,060
it can only be suppressed temporarily?

217
00:09:20,500 --> 00:09:22,260
Do you have another solution?

218
00:09:25,060 --> 00:09:25,780
Well...

219
00:09:26,260 --> 00:09:29,260
Not for now.

220
00:09:32,140 --> 00:09:34,020
But all solution is created by people.

221
00:09:34,700 --> 00:09:37,220
We can consider this as a complicated disease.

222
00:09:38,180 --> 00:09:40,780
Let me help her with the research.

223
00:09:43,740 --> 00:09:44,660
Young Master Li,

224
00:09:45,500 --> 00:09:46,580
let me give you a piece of advice.

225
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:48,100
Life is short.

226
00:09:48,100 --> 00:09:49,180
It's good to have fun while we can.

227
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:51,500
Besides, Miss Tang is in an unusual situation.

228
00:09:51,820 --> 00:09:52,740
What if she...

229
00:09:57,340 --> 00:09:59,860
What if she never experiences the sweetness of love?

230
00:10:00,260 --> 00:10:01,140
That would be a pity.

231
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:02,740
So,

232
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:04,500
as the man,

233
00:10:05,340 --> 00:10:05,980
take the initiative.

234
00:10:12,820 --> 00:10:13,460
What are you thinking about?

235
00:10:13,940 --> 00:10:14,940
Can you figure it out just by thinking?

236
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:17,300
Do you know what she likes?

237
00:10:18,140 --> 00:10:18,540
I...

238
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:19,900
You're hopeless.

239
00:10:20,770 --> 00:10:22,580
You'd better rush your fool of a brother

240
00:10:23,060 --> 00:10:25,260
to practice the Book of Yueque.

241
00:10:28,530 --> 00:10:28,940
Okay.

242
00:10:48,580 --> 00:10:49,020
Brother.

243
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:50,900
Brother, help me quickly.

244
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:52,260
Yesterday, that lunatic used

245
00:10:52,260 --> 00:10:53,100
something called

246
00:10:53,100 --> 00:10:54,460
the Ultimate Seven Steps of Death on me.

247
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,100
One more step and I'll die.

248
00:10:56,420 --> 00:10:57,500
I've already taken six steps.

249
00:10:57,500 --> 00:10:57,940
I...

250
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:09,100
You really didn't move at all.

251
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:12,420
Not bad.

252
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:14,100
You're very obedient.

253
00:11:14,940 --> 00:11:15,740
What do you mean?

254
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:18,700
Were you lying to me?

255
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:22,380
I'll kill you now.

256
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:24,820
Brother.

257
00:11:27,780 --> 00:11:28,980
I am now, I...

258
00:11:30,180 --> 00:11:30,740
Brother.

259
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,380
Give my sword back.

260
00:11:32,650 --> 00:11:33,940
I must kill him today.

261
00:11:34,380 --> 00:11:35,660
Otherwise, what dignity would there be left of me,

262
00:11:35,660 --> 00:11:36,380
the great devil of Xuanqi Mountain?

263
00:11:36,780 --> 00:11:37,250
Xue.

264
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:39,220
Don't always talk about fighting and killing.

265
00:11:39,860 --> 00:11:40,740
It's bad for your illness.

266

Now,

267

only he can cure you.

268
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:46,020
He's not a bad person.

269
00:11:46,860 --> 00:11:48,100
Cooperate with him for your treatment.

270

Li Chengxi.

271
00:11:51,620 --> 00:11:52,500
Now you're siding with outsiders

272
00:11:52,500 --> 00:11:53,260
instead of me?

[Book of Yueque]

274
00:11:58,980 --> 00:11:59,940
Take the Book of Yueque

275
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:01,340
and train well.

276
00:12:04,140 --> 00:12:04,820

Physician Yan,

279
00:12:27,980 --> 00:12:29,780
if you are sincere about curing Xue,

280
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:31,020
don't provoke him all the time

281

lest it backfires.

282

If he goes crazy,

283
00:12:35,940 --> 00:12:36,660
even I can't control him.

284

Don't worry.

I won't let him go crazy.

Make a bigger fire.

You have so many good qualities,

329

but your OCD is a little annoying.

330

You...

331
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,700
don't like it?

332

No.

Coming.

Let's go.

344

Why?

350
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:13,420
Do you want to watch from the sidelines?

351
00:15:12,820 --> 00:15:14,890
♫Flowers in her hat, cosmetics fragrant♫

352
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:14,700
I...

353
00:15:14,740 --> 00:15:15,460
Xue.

354
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:16,700
Didn't I tell you

355
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:18,250
♫The young man in the tavern♫

356
00:15:16,820 --> 00:15:17,930
not to disrespect Physician Yan?

357
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:20,410
♫A little too arrogant♫

358
00:15:20,380 --> 00:15:20,650
Come on.

359

Come on, dance.

360

♫Don’t ask too many corny questions♫

364

Are you afraid I'll run away or is it that you can't bear to leave me?

365
00:15:29,020 --> 00:15:31,620
♫Take the risk and fall in love♫

Yun Gaixue.

376
00:15:47,160 --> 00:15:49,740
♫Everything you said is right♫

377
00:15:47,420 --> 00:15:48,900
Why do you dance with two left feet?

378
00:15:49,010 --> 00:15:50,060
Do you have bad coordination?

379
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:52,360
♫Let’s go, fight back bravely♫

380
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,740
You're insulting my coordination?

381
00:15:51,740 --> 00:15:52,580
You're the one with bad coordination.

382
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:55,820
♫Don’t submit to fate, I’m the world's greatest♫

383
00:15:52,810 --> 00:15:53,780
I'm talking about you.

384
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:54,420
What's wrong?

385
00:15:54,490 --> 00:15:55,020
Dare to compete?

386
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,220
Of course.

387
00:15:58,780 --> 00:16:00,170
Dance competition!

388
00:17:08,780 --> 00:17:09,859
Don't just watch.

389
00:17:10,460 --> 00:17:13,060
Romance is in the air tonight. This is a great chance.

390
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:25,339
Brother Yan, please enlighten me.

391
00:17:27,569 --> 00:17:28,980
Since you've called me a brother,

392
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:31,620
I'll teach you well tonight.

393
00:17:32,540 --> 00:17:33,540
From what I know,

394
00:17:34,580 --> 00:17:37,340
women like to be romanced.

395
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:39,340
But most women

396
00:17:39,460 --> 00:17:41,900
like sparkly things.

397
00:17:42,660 --> 00:17:44,380
For example, fireflies,

398
00:17:44,810 --> 00:17:46,020
fireworks,

399
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:48,420
and even the stars in the sky.

400
00:17:49,060 --> 00:17:51,140
If those don't work, try luminous pearls too.

401
00:17:52,540 --> 00:17:54,700
You must seize this opportunity.

402
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,100
You dance so well.

403
00:18:06,420 --> 00:18:06,980
Yes.

404
00:18:08,660 --> 00:18:10,540
Nice.

405
00:18:11,780 --> 00:18:13,380
You dance like a toad,

406
00:18:13,380 --> 00:18:14,450
so hideous.

407
00:18:14,450 --> 00:18:15,460
You're the hideous one.

408
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:16,700
I danced way better than you.

409
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:19,420
Tell me, who won?

410
00:18:19,540 --> 00:18:19,940
Tell me.

411
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:25,570
It's late.

412
00:18:25,570 --> 00:18:26,220
Time to sleep.

413
00:18:28,380 --> 00:18:29,370
-I won! -I won!

414

415
00:18:32,780 --> 00:18:34,260

416
00:18:34,340 --> 00:18:35,460
-I won! -I won!

417

I won...

418

I'm the winner.

419
00:18:38,810 --> 00:18:39,660
Why are you silent?

420
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:41,660
Silence means consent, so I won.

421
00:18:42,660 --> 00:18:43,620
Time to take your medicine.

422
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:45,970
Yun Gaixue.

423
00:18:45,970 --> 00:18:47,460
I'm telling you, I'm the winner.

424
00:18:47,580 --> 00:18:48,660
You have to admit defeat.

425
00:18:59,020 --> 00:19:00,460
Why did you bring me here?

Li Chengxi.

511
00:22:27,660 --> 00:22:28,460
You changed your clothes?

512
00:22:28,900 --> 00:22:30,020
It's not symmetrical.

513
00:22:31,540 --> 00:22:32,020
You...

514
00:22:32,620 --> 00:22:33,220
don't like it?

515
00:22:33,380 --> 00:22:34,060
I like it.

516
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:36,140
Wait.

517
00:22:36,860 --> 00:22:38,580
It's fine if this ugly monster goes.

518
00:22:38,580 --> 00:22:39,540
Why are you going too?

519
00:22:41,420 --> 00:22:43,340
How can I bear to leave you

520
00:22:43,780 --> 00:22:45,140
before I thoroughly examine you?

521
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:47,300
I...

522
00:22:47,850 --> 00:22:48,860
Go.

523
00:22:53,420 --> 00:22:53,900
Zhi.

524
00:22:54,340 --> 00:22:55,580
I'll leave Xuanqi Mountain to you.

525
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:56,980
Young Master, don't worry.

526
00:22:57,260 --> 00:22:58,660
I’ll take care of everything here,

527
00:22:58,940 --> 00:22:59,540
big and small.

528
00:23:01,490 --> 00:23:01,930
Let's go.

529
00:23:04,180 --> 00:23:04,940
Ruoyu.

530
00:23:05,290 --> 00:23:05,820
I have to go.

531
00:23:06,330 --> 00:23:07,340
Ruoyu.

532
00:23:12,860 --> 00:23:18,620
[Three days later]

533
00:23:18,740 --> 00:23:22,230
[Fengming Pavilion]

534
00:23:28,220 --> 00:23:29,500
Look.

535
00:23:29,700 --> 00:23:30,820
There's a martial arts competition here.

536
00:23:31,330 --> 00:23:32,420
I heard the winner will marry into the wife's family.

537
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:33,860
Hurry up.

538
00:23:34,380 --> 00:23:35,060
It's right ahead.

539
00:23:42,220 --> 00:23:43,140
It's so lively over there.

540
00:23:43,730 --> 00:23:44,420
Let's take a look.

541
00:23:45,620 --> 00:23:46,250
Wait for me.

542
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:09,980
Bravo!

543
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:11,100
Bravo!

544
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:13,340
Who else?

545
00:24:14,460 --> 00:24:15,420
Who else?

546
00:24:16,300 --> 00:24:17,460
These two cowards

547
00:24:17,860 --> 00:24:18,780
are still alive.

548
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:21,060
The champion of this competition

549
00:24:21,370 --> 00:24:22,860
will definitely be us,

550
00:24:23,180 --> 00:24:24,540
the Black Wind's Double Tyrants.

551
00:24:25,420 --> 00:24:25,980
Definitely.

552
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:26,980
Listen up.

553
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:29,980
If you don't agree, try us.

554
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:32,580
Let me teach you two a lesson.

555
00:24:39,860 --> 00:24:42,700
This lady is so beautiful.

556
00:24:42,700 --> 00:24:44,420
These two toads sure can jump.

557
00:24:44,980 --> 00:24:46,820
I'll beat them up and leave them croaking.

558
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:52,980
Another ugly monster.

559
00:24:54,820 --> 00:24:55,940
Don't be a hindrance.

560
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:01,780
This young sir

561
00:25:01,780 --> 00:25:03,940
actually ignored my beauty.

562
00:25:05,180 --> 00:25:06,460
So domineering.

563
00:25:20,620 --> 00:25:22,140
Bravo!

564
00:25:22,220 --> 00:25:22,860
Bravo!

565
00:25:23,060 --> 00:25:23,900
Bravo!

566
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:27,700
Brother.

567
00:25:27,770 --> 00:25:28,940
Look where you're hitting.

568
00:25:35,330 --> 00:25:36,740
Bravo!

569
00:25:37,780 --> 00:25:38,900
Bravo!

570
00:25:47,660 --> 00:25:48,180
Join him down there.

571
00:25:50,780 --> 00:25:51,540
I'll go by myself.

572
00:26:00,580 --> 00:26:01,380
Just you wait and see.

573
00:26:01,980 --> 00:26:02,900
If I don't take revenge,

574
00:26:03,290 --> 00:26:04,500
I swear I'll no longer be human.

575
00:26:06,300 --> 00:26:07,050
That's it?

576
00:26:07,780 --> 00:26:08,730
Brother, wait for me.

577
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:10,620
That wasn't even a warmup for me.

578
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:14,820
Young sir, don't leave in such a hurry.

579
00:26:17,340 --> 00:26:18,860
Don't you want to exchange blows with me?

580
00:26:22,340 --> 00:26:23,140
You want a beating too?

581
00:26:23,780 --> 00:26:24,380
Sure.

582
00:27:17,340 --> 00:27:17,780
You...

583
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:25,540
Handsome.

584
00:27:39,300 --> 00:27:41,180
This young hero is so handsome.

585
00:27:47,380 --> 00:27:48,570
What a strange day.

586
00:27:49,340 --> 00:27:50,860
Why are all the men I run into

587
00:27:50,860 --> 00:27:52,420
playing hard to get?

588
00:27:53,100 --> 00:27:54,700
That one just now looks domineering

589
00:27:54,900 --> 00:27:56,180
but is actually a fool.

590
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,940
This one...

591
00:27:58,220 --> 00:27:59,380
is more suited to my taste.

592
00:28:01,500 --> 00:28:02,860
Young sir, thank you for saving me.

593
00:28:03,420 --> 00:28:05,660
I don't know how to repay...

594
00:28:17,660 --> 00:28:19,460
How is he unaffected by my seduction skill?

595
00:28:19,740 --> 00:28:21,740
So her powers can confuse others' emotions.

596
00:28:22,260 --> 00:28:23,820
No wonder Xue behaved abnormally.

597
00:28:25,860 --> 00:28:26,660
Lady, please conduct yourself with dignity.

598
00:28:29,970 --> 00:28:30,460
Xue.

599
00:28:32,420 --> 00:28:34,300
Who exactly is this young sir?

600
00:28:34,860 --> 00:28:36,780
How was he not confused by my seduction skill?

601
00:28:44,300 --> 00:28:44,940
Is he okay?

602
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:55,810
So it's the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

603
00:28:56,380 --> 00:28:57,380
I knew it.

604
00:28:57,820 --> 00:29:00,100
How else could you face a beauty like me,

605
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,540
and even resist my seduction skill?

606
00:29:01,780 --> 00:29:03,500
Ordinary men don't have such composure.

607
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:04,980
You demoness.

608
00:29:05,420 --> 00:29:06,660
How dare you play dirty tricks on me?

609
00:29:06,900 --> 00:29:07,740
I'll kill you!

610
00:29:07,780 --> 00:29:08,340
Stop!

611
00:29:12,420 --> 00:29:13,620
Don't be rude to our manager.

612
00:29:15,660 --> 00:29:16,500
Manager?

613
00:29:18,340 --> 00:29:19,140
Could it be...

614
00:29:19,620 --> 00:29:21,300
she's the manager of Fengming Pavilion?

615
00:29:24,940 --> 00:29:25,780
I've heard a lot about you.

616
00:29:25,980 --> 00:29:27,620
You look beautiful today...

617
00:29:28,580 --> 00:29:31,020
You really have a unique aura.

618
00:29:31,860 --> 00:29:32,900
Let me introduce myself.

619
00:29:33,260 --> 00:29:34,220
I am...

620
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,940
The chief of Tang Sect in Shu, Tang Buyan.

621
00:29:37,700 --> 00:29:38,820
You have good judgment.

622
00:29:40,340 --> 00:29:41,420
You came to me

623
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,540
for the list of Teardrop Mole people

624
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,620
and information of people who know the ancient script.

625
00:29:46,580 --> 00:29:47,090
Yes.

626
00:29:47,290 --> 00:29:48,660
You're indeed the manager of Fengming Pavilion.

627
00:29:48,900 --> 00:29:50,060
You're really well-informed.

628
00:29:50,580 --> 00:29:53,260
Manager Shen, please name a price.

629
00:29:53,540 --> 00:29:54,700
What price?

630
00:29:55,380 --> 00:29:57,810
These information are for free.

631
00:29:58,420 --> 00:29:58,940
Really?

632
00:29:59,180 --> 00:30:00,060
Since Young Sir Li

633
00:30:00,060 --> 00:30:02,010
won this competition where I'm seeking for a husband,

634
00:30:02,180 --> 00:30:03,860
he is now my husband.

635
00:30:04,860 --> 00:30:06,010
When a wife deals with her husband

636
00:30:06,060 --> 00:30:07,340
and his friends,

637
00:30:07,580 --> 00:30:09,340
there's no accepting money.

638
00:30:09,420 --> 00:30:10,300
Husband?

639
00:30:11,250 --> 00:30:12,180
Martial arts competition seeking a husband?

640
00:30:12,540 --> 00:30:13,570
Manager Shen, there is a misunderstanding.

641
00:30:14,060 --> 00:30:14,980
I came on stage

642
00:30:15,250 --> 00:30:16,060
only to save my brother.

643
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,220
But you ruined the stage of my competition.

644
00:30:21,460 --> 00:30:22,540
It doesn't make sense

645
00:30:22,540 --> 00:30:23,580
if you don't compensate me with a husband.

646
00:30:24,460 --> 00:30:25,060
Besides,

647
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:26,940
if you marry me,

648
00:30:27,450 --> 00:30:29,580
you'll become the second owner of Fengming Pavilion.

649
00:30:30,180 --> 00:30:32,380
You can get all the information you want.

650
00:30:33,060 --> 00:30:34,460
Young sir Li, what do you think?

651
00:30:34,740 --> 00:30:35,260
No thank you.

652
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:36,620
Goodbye.

653
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:42,180
What about the information on the ancient script?

654
00:30:47,380 --> 00:30:47,940
Well,

655
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,340
manager Shen,

656
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,740
you are beautiful and magnanimous.

657
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:53,580
Don't mind them.

658
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:56,620
Let's discuss the sale of these information.

659
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:57,980
Unless

660
00:30:58,620 --> 00:31:00,580
Young sir Li marries into my family,

661
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:02,620
these information...

662
00:31:03,900 --> 00:31:04,580
will not be for sale.

663
00:31:04,940 --> 00:31:06,260
Manager Shen, you...

664
00:31:15,260 --> 00:31:15,900
Manager.

665
00:31:16,500 --> 00:31:17,740
You're letting them go just like that?

666
00:31:18,780 --> 00:31:19,500
Don't worry.

667
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,500
They'll be back again.
