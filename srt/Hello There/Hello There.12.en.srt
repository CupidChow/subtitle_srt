[Episode 12]

4
00:00:53,900 --> 00:00:55,500
Why do you have a teardrop mole too?

5
00:01:10,900 --> 00:01:13,580
Why is my heart aching again?

6
00:01:14,300 --> 00:01:17,220
Was Yan Ran right in saying

7
00:01:17,660 --> 00:01:19,420
that I've fallen in love with Li Chengxi?

8
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:21,330
Catch that thief!

9
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:23,140
Behave yourself!

10
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:33,060
Manager?

11
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:37,340
-Manager. -Manager.

12
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:39,020
What are you doing?

13
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:41,420
I'm catching the thief that broke into Fengming Pavilion.

14
00:01:41,539 --> 00:01:42,420
Thief?

15
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:43,700
This is my cousin!

16
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:46,900
Hi, cousin.

17
00:01:51,259 --> 00:01:52,210
What's going on?

18
00:01:52,900 --> 00:01:53,690
I'm Li Jian,

19
00:01:54,020 --> 00:01:55,060
Shen Yi's cousin.

20
00:01:55,220 --> 00:01:56,780
Someone hit my acupoint with a silver needle

21
00:01:56,820 --> 00:01:57,620
which made me unable to speak.

22
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,020
That's why there was a misunderstanding.

23
00:02:00,620 --> 00:02:01,900
No wonder I saw a silver needle

24
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:02,980
at the back of your neck.

25
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:08,419
So,

26
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:10,900
you were helping him pull out the silver needle?

27
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:11,940
Yes.

28
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:16,820
This is how you do your job?

29
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:18,620
Taking my cousin as a thief?

30
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:21,180
This gentleman is in black

31
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:22,300
and wearing a mask.

32
00:02:22,579 --> 00:02:23,820
It's a very misleading outfit.

33
00:02:25,660 --> 00:02:26,500
Wait, Manager.

34
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:28,500
Since your cousin is not the thief,

35
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:30,980
then the real thief must still be here.

36
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,900
Yeah.

37
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:34,540
A long time has passed.

38
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:36,780
That thief might have left.

39
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:41,940
Dear Li is right.

40
00:02:42,820 --> 00:02:44,100
It's already so late.

41
00:02:45,020 --> 00:02:46,620
The thief must have left.

42
00:02:47,460 --> 00:02:48,780
Everybody, go back and rest.

43
00:02:49,100 --> 00:02:50,210
You've been bustling around all night.

44
00:02:50,410 --> 00:02:51,220
Badou,

45
00:02:51,890 --> 00:02:53,740
take my cousin to rest in his room.

46
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:56,020
Go.

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:02:58,579
Cousin,

48
00:02:59,380 --> 00:03:02,020
Mr. Li, Miss Tang, good night.

49
00:03:04,580 --> 00:03:05,300
Please.

50
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:12,980
Dear Li,

51
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:14,860
good night.

52
00:03:45,300 --> 00:03:45,940
-You... -You...

53
00:03:50,260 --> 00:03:51,060
You go first.

54
00:03:52,260 --> 00:03:54,180
I was at fault in that matter.

55
00:03:54,620 --> 00:03:56,900
I bought this jade coronet for you.

56
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:00,580
It's for me?

57
00:04:07,620 --> 00:04:09,260
I don't know what you like,

58
00:04:09,580 --> 00:04:11,300
so I asked Li Jian.

59
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:12,700
He said you would like this.

60
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:24,460
When do you plan

61
00:04:25,340 --> 00:04:26,540
to give Li Jian the blood test?

62
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:29,140
Well...

63
00:04:32,380 --> 00:04:34,659
Whether he is the Destined One or not,

64
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,700
my family have the right to know it.

65
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:38,380
So,

66
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:41,260
I'll do it tomorrow.

67
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:46,380
Okay.

68
00:04:50,260 --> 00:04:50,940
Good night.

69
00:05:13,380 --> 00:05:14,780
Why am I hungry again?

70
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,220
It seems that I need to have some supper tonight.

71
00:05:19,220 --> 00:05:20,620
The thief last night was a tough guy.

72
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:21,940
Many people were injured by him.

73
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:24,220
Yes. Even Physician Yan was badly injured.

74
00:05:24,500 --> 00:05:25,540
A doctor has been called in,

75
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:26,780
but no one knows if he can be cured.

76
00:05:26,970 --> 00:05:27,540
What did you say?

77
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,700
Who was injured?

78
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:30,020
Physician Yan.

79
00:05:30,220 --> 00:05:31,100
When we arrived,

80
00:05:31,220 --> 00:05:32,540
he was lying on the floor.

81
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:33,380
He must have been badly injured.

82
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:33,980
Madman.

83
00:05:36,020 --> 00:05:36,740
Madman.

84
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:39,020
Madman.

85
00:05:40,610 --> 00:05:41,420
Madman.

86
00:05:42,020 --> 00:05:42,930
You're really going to die?

87
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:45,740
Xue.

88
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:48,610
I don't have much time left.

89
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:51,130
But I'm the only one

90
00:05:52,220 --> 00:05:53,820
who can cure your illness.

91
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:56,780
Xue.

92
00:05:57,700 --> 00:05:58,700
After I die,

93
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:02,540
don't be too sad.

94
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,180
What are you talking about?

95
00:06:06,020 --> 00:06:06,860
Why would I be sad?

96
00:06:07,820 --> 00:06:08,620
Die.

97
00:06:09,100 --> 00:06:10,140
Die now.

98
00:06:10,420 --> 00:06:11,980
Once you die, I can immediately finish training in the Book of Yueque.

99
00:06:17,980 --> 00:06:18,980
I was just saying.

100
00:06:18,980 --> 00:06:20,460
I don't want you to die.

101
00:06:22,620 --> 00:06:23,460
Xue.

102
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:25,580
I know

103
00:06:26,980 --> 00:06:29,020
you actually care about me, right?

104
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:31,540
Nonsense.

105
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:33,260
I just...

106
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:36,620
I am...

107
00:06:39,740 --> 00:06:40,540
Xue,

108
00:06:41,620 --> 00:06:42,740
are you crying?

109
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:46,370
How's that possible?

110
00:06:47,500 --> 00:06:48,290
Look at yourself.

111
00:06:49,820 --> 00:06:50,740
Your face is so pale.

112
00:07:04,660 --> 00:07:05,540
How dare you!

113
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:07,810
How dare you fool me like this?

114
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:16,580
Aren't you dying?

115
00:07:16,780 --> 00:07:17,660
Why are you so energetic?

116
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:20,180
I'm just playing tough.

117
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:21,220
I'm just playing tough.

118
00:07:25,460 --> 00:07:26,460
-Blood! Don't come near me! -No.

119
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:27,580
You're really hurt?

120
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:28,410
I...

121
00:07:28,460 --> 00:07:29,020
Get out.

122
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:29,660
I'll dress the cut myself.

123
00:07:29,660 --> 00:07:30,380
I didn't mean it.

124
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:31,140
Leave.

125
00:07:33,940 --> 00:07:35,020
How could you kick me?

126
00:07:35,540 --> 00:07:36,580
If you weren't injured,

127
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:37,820
I would teach you a hard lesson.

128
00:07:40,060 --> 00:07:41,659
God, it hurts like hell.

129
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:42,659
It won't

130
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:43,740
stop bleeding.

131
00:07:43,940 --> 00:07:44,620
What should I do?

132
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:47,420
You had it coming.

133
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:57,900
By the riverside,

134
00:07:58,340 --> 00:07:59,659
a pair of turtledoves are cooing.

135
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:01,980
There is a maiden fair

136
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:03,700
whom a young man is wooing.

137
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:10,220
I, Tang Buyan, am a defender of justice.

138
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:12,540
If he dares to appear again,

139
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:13,900
I'll protect you.

140
00:08:25,420 --> 00:08:26,140
Mr. Li.

141
00:08:27,980 --> 00:08:28,780
Miss Tang.

142
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,780
Mr. Li, I finally found you.

143
00:08:47,140 --> 00:08:47,820
You were looking for me?

144
00:08:48,690 --> 00:08:49,100
Yes.

145
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:52,380
I need your help with something.

146
00:08:52,620 --> 00:08:53,420
Anything.

147
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:56,620
Actually, I'm dying.

148
00:08:56,980 --> 00:08:59,380
Everyone in my family has blood vessel disease.

149
00:08:59,610 --> 00:09:01,340
None of us can live past 25 years old.

150
00:09:01,900 --> 00:09:04,820
And I may not be able to make it to 20 years old.

151
00:09:05,140 --> 00:09:06,130
Is there a cure?

152
00:09:06,740 --> 00:09:07,180
Yes.

153
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,740
As long as I marry the Destined One,

154
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,420
my disease will be cured.

155
00:09:11,740 --> 00:09:12,780
According to my ancestors,

156
00:09:13,250 --> 00:09:14,530
someone with a teardrop mole below his eye

157
00:09:14,820 --> 00:09:17,180
whose blood can light the Blood Testing Stone

158
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:18,340
is the Destined one.

159
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:19,940
So…

160
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,180
I know it's rude to ask for this,

161
00:09:23,420 --> 00:09:26,020
but can you let me...

162
00:09:26,020 --> 00:09:26,580
Sure.

163
00:09:29,620 --> 00:09:31,820
I'll be very glad if I can help you.

164
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:34,460
You're so kind.

165
00:09:34,780 --> 00:09:35,340
Thank you.

166
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:38,890
Miss Tang,

167
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:41,140
it's getting cold. Wrap up warm.

168
00:09:43,730 --> 00:09:44,420
No, thank you.

169
00:09:44,460 --> 00:09:45,540
I'm not that fragile.

170
00:10:03,140 --> 00:10:04,100
Are you okay?

171
00:10:06,540 --> 00:10:07,940
Miss Tang, I think

172
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:09,260
I sprained my ankle.

173
00:10:10,620 --> 00:10:11,620
It's all my fault.

174
00:10:12,180 --> 00:10:13,770
Let me take you to Physician Yan.

175
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,610
Be careful.

176
00:10:15,580 --> 00:10:16,300
Li Chengxi.

177
00:10:16,620 --> 00:10:17,340
What are you doing here?

178
00:10:18,460 --> 00:10:20,140
Li Jian sprained his ankle.

179
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:21,380
Come and give me a hand.

180
00:10:21,820 --> 00:10:22,780
Don't bother.

181
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:23,900
I got it.

182
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:28,980
Li Chengxi.

183
00:10:29,060 --> 00:10:31,220
Li Jian is the one who needs help. Why are you carrying me?

184
00:10:31,300 --> 00:10:32,020
Put me down.

185
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,460
Mr. Li,

186
00:10:33,820 --> 00:10:34,820
Miss Tang asked you to put her down.

187
00:10:34,980 --> 00:10:35,420
Move!

188
00:10:36,060 --> 00:10:37,100
You've gone too far.

189
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:39,300
Mr. Li,  your ankle healed so fast.

190
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:42,500
I'm just worried about her.

191
00:10:43,660 --> 00:10:45,820
Li Chengxi, what's wrong?

192
00:10:46,900 --> 00:10:48,020
Put me down!

193
00:10:57,290 --> 00:10:57,980
Cousin,

194
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,300
what took you so long?

195
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:02,820
Mr. Li, how's your ankle?

196
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:03,940
It's just a minor injury.

197
00:11:04,100 --> 00:11:04,660
I'm fine.

198
00:11:05,020 --> 00:11:06,060
Stop dawdling.

199
00:11:06,180 --> 00:11:07,060
Do the test now.

200
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:41,300
It turns out that Mr. Li is not…

201
00:11:48,100 --> 00:11:48,740
Yan,

202
00:11:49,260 --> 00:11:51,220
I'm the Destined One for you!

203
00:11:51,940 --> 00:11:53,100
That's great, Miss Tang.

204
00:11:53,810 --> 00:11:55,100
It's such a surprise

205
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:56,180
that the Destined One you went through

206
00:11:56,300 --> 00:11:57,300
so much to find is my cousin.

207
00:11:58,780 --> 00:12:00,780
You two are such a perfect match.

208
00:12:01,620 --> 00:12:02,540
Dear Li,

209
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:04,980
you are happy for Miss Tang too, aren't you?

210
00:12:13,940 --> 00:12:14,780
Miss Tang,

211
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,540
it's only a few years left

212
00:12:16,540 --> 00:12:17,940
before your blood vessel disease takes your life.

213
00:12:18,260 --> 00:12:19,380
You can't wait any longer.

214
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:20,620
Why don't you two get married immediately?

215
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:21,460
-No. -No.

216
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:29,530
Cousin,

217
00:12:30,100 --> 00:12:31,020
you are a man.

218
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:33,260
Yan is a girl. She must feel shy now.

219
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,620
Make your attitude clear to her.

220
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:36,580
Of course, I'm willing to help Yan

221
00:12:36,580 --> 00:12:37,620
cure her disease.

222
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:39,380
But in the end,

223
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,180
it's Yan's decision to make.

224
00:12:41,980 --> 00:12:44,650
It's just that the disease has been bothering you for so many years.

225
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:46,220
I'm afraid that if you delay this any longer,

226
00:12:46,580 --> 00:12:47,780
you'll be in more danger.

227
00:12:48,260 --> 00:12:49,580
You should solve it as soon as possible.

228
00:12:50,860 --> 00:12:52,140
Thank you, Mr. Li.

229
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:53,180
I...

230
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:55,740
I'll make the decision as soon as possible.

231
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:56,660
Okay.

232
00:12:57,340 --> 00:12:57,980
I'll wait for you.

233
00:13:28,660 --> 00:13:30,500
Now that I've found the Destined One,

234
00:13:31,820 --> 00:13:33,380
I should be happy.

235
00:13:35,660 --> 00:13:38,140
But why am I not happy at all?

236
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:40,580
Why am I so upset?

237
00:13:42,220 --> 00:13:43,020
Could it be

238
00:13:43,700 --> 00:13:45,620
that Physician Yan was right?

239
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:50,200
♫Is it right or wrong to let go♫

240
00:13:46,820 --> 00:13:48,420
Have I fallen in love with Li Chengxi?

241
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:51,380
No way.

242
00:13:51,710 --> 00:13:57,090
♫With a heart beating warm but pretending to be cold♫

243
00:13:51,860 --> 00:13:54,020
It must be because I've just met Li Jian

244
00:13:54,140 --> 00:13:55,220
and am not familiar with him yet.

245
00:13:56,020 --> 00:13:57,980
As long as we get familiar with each other,

246
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:00,120
♫Whether I lose you or keep you♫

247
00:13:58,210 --> 00:13:59,500
I'll be willing to marry him.

00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:05,820
♫We can't escape the torture♫

249
00:14:08,540 --> 00:14:10,700
At the thought of marrying Li Jian,

250
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:13,510
♫Your figure is very thin♫

251
00:14:11,060 --> 00:14:12,580
I somehow feel even more upset.

00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:19,630
♫Choking up, I look even weaker♫

253

♫No matter how much I say♫

255
00:14:23,380 --> 00:14:24,020
Brother,

256

senior sister,

257
00:14:27,780 --> 00:14:29,660
I wish you were still here.

258
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,020
So you could tell me

259
00:14:31,670 --> 00:14:37,080
♫Thousand years of reincarnation is too confusing♫

260
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:33,980

00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:42,160
♫I can't tell what character I'm playing♫

♫Closing my eyes♫

263

♫Reaching out and touching with my hands♫

♫Feeling your face based on memory♫

265

The disease has been bothering you for so many years.

266
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,140
I'm afraid that if you delay this any longer,

♫The mockery of fate, how difficult it is♫

268

♫Yearning is easily broken♫

270
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:04,220

Who's there?

275
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:35,660
It's me.

276
00:15:36,260 --> 00:15:37,060
Cousin,

277
00:15:37,660 --> 00:15:39,180
do we have to meet up like this?

278
00:15:40,060 --> 00:15:41,260
Can't we behave normally?

279
00:15:42,740 --> 00:15:44,380
This meeting is very important.

280
00:15:44,820 --> 00:15:46,420
It's related to the survival of the Four Great Sects.

281
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,820
So we must be careful.

282
00:15:49,460 --> 00:15:50,180
Cousin,

283
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:53,380
can we talk in a more comfortable way?

284
00:15:53,620 --> 00:15:54,260
No.

285
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:56,420
Because this is my style.

286
00:15:56,900 --> 00:15:57,700
Fine.

287
00:15:58,140 --> 00:15:59,140
Keep going on with your lunatic style.

288
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,780
I quit.

289
00:16:03,260 --> 00:16:04,540
For you to marry Tang Buyan,

290
00:16:04,980 --> 00:16:06,140
and for me to marry Li Chengxi,

291
00:16:06,340 --> 00:16:08,940
we must work together to get between them.

292
00:16:12,340 --> 00:16:13,300
What's your plan?

293
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:15,540
Come here.

294
00:16:24,650 --> 00:16:25,780
Believe me.

295
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,060
When what is done can't be undone,

296
00:16:28,220 --> 00:16:31,020
Li Chengxi will have no choice but to change his mind.

297
00:16:39,220 --> 00:16:40,020
Yan,

298
00:16:40,420 --> 00:16:41,980
there's a good dessert shop in Fengqi Town.

299
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,180
Why don't we go there together?

300
00:16:44,300 --> 00:16:47,220
But I don't have much appetite recently.

301
00:16:47,460 --> 00:16:48,740
Maybe next time.

302
00:16:54,180 --> 00:16:54,700
Yan,

303
00:16:55,260 --> 00:16:57,620
there seems to be sand in my right eye.

304
00:16:57,900 --> 00:16:58,940
Can you take a look for me?

305
00:17:01,980 --> 00:17:02,780
Where is it?

306
00:17:03,220 --> 00:17:03,700
Here.

307
00:17:06,300 --> 00:17:07,220
Let me see.

308
00:17:10,220 --> 00:17:11,060
Dear Li.

309
00:17:11,900 --> 00:17:12,700
Look.

310
00:17:13,339 --> 00:17:15,540
My cousin and cousin-in-law are such a good match.

311
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:18,660
They look perfect together.

312
00:17:19,490 --> 00:17:21,859
I've been worried about my cousin-in-law's disease,

313
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:23,619
but it seems

314
00:17:24,420 --> 00:17:26,140
that they can have a baby next year.

315
00:17:27,859 --> 00:17:28,660
Mr. Li,

316
00:17:29,170 --> 00:17:31,140
maybe it's because your eyes are small.

317
00:17:31,300 --> 00:17:33,220
I can't see any sand.

318
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,690
Maybe it's because the sand is too small.

319
00:17:35,980 --> 00:17:36,460
Yan,

320
00:17:36,860 --> 00:17:38,580
can you take me to Physician Yan?

321
00:17:38,780 --> 00:17:39,540
I can't see clearly.

322
00:17:40,540 --> 00:17:41,700
Okay. Follow me.

323
00:17:47,660 --> 00:17:49,580
Looks like they're going on a date.

324
00:17:51,580 --> 00:17:54,500
Dear Li, why don't we go on a date as well?

325
00:17:57,500 --> 00:17:58,540
I'm not feeling well.

326
00:17:59,380 --> 00:18:00,180
Excuse me.

327
00:18:05,260 --> 00:18:06,500
It's getting late.

328
00:18:07,060 --> 00:18:08,740

00:19:33,170 --> 00:19:39,380
♫No matter how much I say♫

341
00:19:36,660 --> 00:19:38,140
What took you so long to come to me?

342
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:39,540
I miss you so much.

343
00:19:40,900 --> 00:19:42,340
I miss you so much.

344
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:47,350
♫Thousand years of reincarnation is too confusing♫

345
00:19:47,640 --> 00:19:52,420
♫I can't tell what character I'm playing♫

346
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:55,870
♫Closing my eyes♫

347
00:19:56,230 --> 00:19:58,550
♫Reaching out and touching with my hands♫

348
00:19:58,780 --> 00:20:04,330
♫Feeling your face based on memory♫

349
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:09,520
♫The mockery of fate, how difficult it is♫

350
00:20:08,500 --> 00:20:09,290
Stop looking.

351
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:15,160
♫Yearning is easily broken♫

352
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:13,380
That's odd.

353
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:16,740
Li Chengxi never felt a thing for Shen Yi.

354
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:18,410
♫The more you want to escape♫

355
00:20:17,020 --> 00:20:18,420
Why has he suddenly accepted her?

356
00:20:18,830 --> 00:20:21,090
♫The deeper the pain is♫

357
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,940
There must be something wrong.

358
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,420
Yan.

359
00:20:21,710 --> 00:20:27,360
♫The tears try not to glisten♫

360
00:20:23,340 --> 00:20:24,420
People change.

361
00:20:25,540 --> 00:20:26,780
My cousin is quite good-looking.

362
00:20:27,180 --> 00:20:28,810
Maybe Mr. Li didn't like her at first,

363
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:30,930
but after spending so much time with her,

364
00:20:33,020 --> 00:20:33,820
he naturally fell for her.

365
00:20:38,620 --> 00:20:42,810
♫Your figure is very thin♫

366
00:20:43,510 --> 00:20:48,930
♫Choking up, I look even weaker♫

367
00:20:44,140 --> 00:20:44,940
Yan,

368
00:20:45,540 --> 00:20:46,540
you have blood vessel disease.

369
00:20:47,180 --> 00:20:48,620
You can only be with the Destined One.

370
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:50,620
As your best friend,

371
00:20:49,990 --> 00:20:52,300
♫Breath and pulse♫

372
00:20:51,530 --> 00:20:52,980
Mr. Li will surely be happy for us.

00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:58,340
♫Are quietly stopped by eternity♫

374

♫I can't tell what character I'm playing♫

00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:35,410
♫You said to me♫

382
00:21:29,420 --> 00:21:30,220
What are you doing?

383
00:21:33,020 --> 00:21:33,860
Dear Li,

384
00:21:34,420 --> 00:21:35,900
don't you want your pretty girl?

385
00:21:36,820 --> 00:21:37,940
Pretty girl?

386
00:21:38,340 --> 00:21:40,180
But you are not my pretty girl.

387
00:21:40,460 --> 00:21:42,540
My pretty girl is much more beautiful than you.

388
00:21:44,340 --> 00:21:45,730
Tang Buyan is more beautiful than me?

389
00:21:45,980 --> 00:21:46,940
Are you blind?

390
00:21:48,820 --> 00:21:49,730
What a pity.

391
00:21:50,180 --> 00:21:51,100
Your pretty girl

392
00:21:51,100 --> 00:21:52,780
is going to marry someone else.

393
00:21:53,140 --> 00:21:54,660
What are you talking about?

394
00:21:55,980 --> 00:21:57,090
How's it possible

395
00:21:57,090 --> 00:21:58,980
that my pretty girl will marry someone else?

396
00:22:09,940 --> 00:22:10,730
Dear Li,

397
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:12,740
are you very angry now?

398
00:22:12,740 --> 00:22:13,740
You want to beat me, don't you?

399
00:22:14,180 --> 00:22:14,660
Come on.

400
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:16,580
Beat me! Give me a hard time!

401
00:22:38,620 --> 00:22:41,180
Can't believe she had the nerve to take advantage of my brother.

402
00:22:41,460 --> 00:22:42,500
I won't let it happen.

403
00:22:44,140 --> 00:22:46,100
Brother, why are you drunk again?

404
00:22:46,580 --> 00:22:47,460
I'm not drunk.

405
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:51,060
Xue, you came.

406
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:56,100
You used your kung fu?

407
00:22:56,970 --> 00:22:58,460
Did you do something bad again?

408
00:22:59,020 --> 00:23:00,180
I didn't.

409
00:23:00,530 --> 00:23:01,540
Listen.

410
00:23:02,100 --> 00:23:04,860
Good boys don't do bad things.

411
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:06,850
If you do something bad,

412
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,180
you'll be punished.

413
00:23:13,980 --> 00:23:15,140
Seriously?

414
00:23:15,620 --> 00:23:17,140
I just saved you.

415
00:23:25,860 --> 00:23:27,220
Treat me rudely.

416
00:23:27,620 --> 00:23:28,490
I love it.

417
00:23:29,220 --> 00:23:29,660
Come on.

418
00:23:29,940 --> 00:23:30,660
Give me a hard time.

419
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:31,340
Don't stop.

420
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:39,020
It's over?

421
00:23:40,100 --> 00:23:41,140
Dear Li,

422
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:42,340
let's keep doing it.

423
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:44,580
Dear Li.

424
00:23:47,810 --> 00:23:48,740
Dear Li.

425
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:09,460
Great.

426
00:24:09,820 --> 00:24:10,540
Xue?

427
00:24:11,460 --> 00:24:12,860
Why are you here?

428
00:24:15,700 --> 00:24:16,610
You tell me.

429
00:24:50,340 --> 00:24:50,940
Morning.

430
00:25:04,180 --> 00:25:06,380
You must have been exhausted last night.

431
00:25:06,620 --> 00:25:08,780
I thought you'd sleep in.

432
00:25:12,290 --> 00:25:14,180
You heard that?

433
00:25:16,180 --> 00:25:17,100
I'm fine.

434
00:25:17,580 --> 00:25:18,380
But I kept

435
00:25:20,020 --> 00:25:21,300
that person up all night.

436
00:25:21,820 --> 00:25:24,180
That person's still unable to get off the bed yet.

437
00:25:29,540 --> 00:25:30,500
Li Chengxi.

438
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,660
How on earth do you feel about that person?

439
00:25:34,740 --> 00:25:35,660
How do I feel?

440
00:25:38,700 --> 00:25:39,500
That person

441
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:43,180
is the most important one to me in the world.

442
00:25:44,980 --> 00:25:46,260
I will protect that person forever.

443
00:25:58,020 --> 00:25:58,660
You...

444
00:26:02,290 --> 00:26:02,980
Yan.

445
00:26:03,740 --> 00:26:04,410
Yan!

446
00:26:18,340 --> 00:26:19,060
Yan!

447
00:26:19,940 --> 00:26:20,740
Yan.

448
00:26:26,500 --> 00:26:27,290
What's wrong with you?

449
00:26:30,820 --> 00:26:31,620
Are you okay?

450
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:33,260
Whether I'm fine or not

451
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:34,940
has nothing to do with you.

452
00:26:36,980 --> 00:26:37,540
I...

453
00:26:46,140 --> 00:26:46,980
Cake!

454
00:26:49,060 --> 00:26:51,580
Li Chengxi, you kept me up all night.

455
00:26:51,740 --> 00:26:53,300
You can't give me some cakes and expect me to forgive you.

456
00:26:54,540 --> 00:26:55,300
I know.

457
00:26:55,820 --> 00:26:56,730
It was my fault.

458
00:26:57,540 --> 00:26:58,260
Enjoy the cakes.

459
00:27:04,420 --> 00:27:05,060
So,

460
00:27:05,420 --> 00:27:08,300
the person in question is Yun Gaixue?

461
00:27:08,380 --> 00:27:09,180
Yeah.

462
00:27:09,820 --> 00:27:10,460
What's wrong?

463
00:27:14,060 --> 00:27:15,850
Nothing.

464
00:27:19,900 --> 00:27:20,460
Yan,

465
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:22,900
you looked pale just now.

466
00:27:23,810 --> 00:27:25,060
You should go and see Physician Yan.

467
00:27:26,060 --> 00:27:26,740
Okay.

468
00:27:27,180 --> 00:27:28,860
I'll go to him now.

469
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:50,500
Stop sighing. I'm not less frustrated than you.

470
00:27:51,900 --> 00:27:52,580
Cousin,

471
00:27:52,860 --> 00:27:54,620
I don't blame you for the failure of our plan.

472
00:27:54,930 --> 00:27:56,540
We can come up with a new plan.

473
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:58,090
Are you sure you don't blame me?

474
00:27:58,580 --> 00:28:00,140
Your expression

475
00:28:00,140 --> 00:28:01,100
is saying that you blame everything on me.

476
00:28:02,020 --> 00:28:04,060
I was so close,

477
00:28:04,780 --> 00:28:06,580
and that douchebag came out of nowhere.

478
00:28:07,220 --> 00:28:08,020
And you.

479
00:28:08,260 --> 00:28:10,180
You're already Tang Buyan's Destined One.

480
00:28:10,180 --> 00:28:11,180
You should've long got to her.

481
00:28:13,060 --> 00:28:14,620
Let's stop pointing fingers at each other.

482
00:28:14,860 --> 00:28:16,220
We should focus on what to do next.

483
00:28:18,140 --> 00:28:18,820
Forget it.

484
00:28:20,100 --> 00:28:21,940
Since Li Chengxi can't be seduced,

485
00:28:22,380 --> 00:28:23,580
you're the only one we can count on now.

486
00:28:25,340 --> 00:28:26,260
What are you going to do?

487
00:28:28,060 --> 00:28:30,100
Just treat Tang Buyan well.

488
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:34,380
I'll take care of the rest.

489
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,500
Yan.

490
00:28:53,820 --> 00:28:55,420
I heard you weren't feeling well yesterday.

491
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:56,340
Are you okay?

492
00:28:57,500 --> 00:28:58,300
I'm fine.

493
00:28:58,700 --> 00:29:00,420
Has your blood vessel disease worsened?

494
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:03,780
Don't worry.

495
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,660
I'm your Destined One.

496
00:29:05,820 --> 00:29:07,460
I'll cure your disease.

497
00:29:09,620 --> 00:29:10,740
If you don't object,

498
00:29:11,460 --> 00:29:12,700
we can get married right away.

499
00:29:19,060 --> 00:29:21,290
There's no need to rush.

500
00:29:28,650 --> 00:29:29,460
Yan,

501
00:29:30,220 --> 00:29:32,100
if you don't cure your disease now,

502
00:29:32,420 --> 00:29:33,980
you'll only have one or two years left.

503
00:29:34,420 --> 00:29:36,180
I can't stand by and let you die.

504
00:29:37,780 --> 00:29:38,580
I...

505
00:29:41,220 --> 00:29:41,890
Cousin,

506
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,420
simply talking with her won't work.

507
00:29:43,770 --> 00:29:45,900
Let me do you a favor.

508
00:29:47,860 --> 00:29:49,100
It was an effort for me

509
00:29:49,180 --> 00:29:50,580
to get this exotic incense.

510
00:29:50,980 --> 00:29:51,700
You'll be grateful to me afterwards.

511
00:30:11,820 --> 00:30:13,410
Why is it so hot suddenly?

512
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:22,010
Brother Yan,

513
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:23,660
did Yan faint yesterday

514
00:30:24,060 --> 00:30:25,380
because her disease has worsened?

515
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:27,580
I was about to talk to you about it.

516
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:29,570
I checked her pulse

517
00:30:30,060 --> 00:30:32,620
and found that her disease has gotten better.

518
00:30:33,340 --> 00:30:34,140
What

519
00:30:34,860 --> 00:30:36,180
did you do to her?

520
00:30:39,250 --> 00:30:40,420
After she fainted yesterday,

521
00:30:41,180 --> 00:30:42,180
I hurriedly injected my power

522
00:30:42,810 --> 00:30:43,980
into her body.

523
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:49,660
The Book of Yueque?

524
00:30:50,940 --> 00:30:51,980
Why didn't it occur to me?

525
00:30:52,860 --> 00:30:54,860
The Book of Yueque extended Tang Sishi's life,

526
00:30:55,140 --> 00:30:56,580
so if Yan makes good use of it,

527
00:30:57,020 --> 00:30:58,700
it may work for her too.

528
00:30:58,860 --> 00:30:59,660
In other words,

529
00:30:59,940 --> 00:31:01,060
the Book of Yueque

530
00:31:01,220 --> 00:31:02,180
can save not only Xue

531
00:31:03,340 --> 00:31:04,300
but also Yan.

532
00:31:04,860 --> 00:31:06,570
It's very likely.

533
00:31:34,020 --> 00:31:34,660
Yan.

534
00:31:37,980 --> 00:31:38,660
Yan.

535
00:31:40,140 --> 00:31:41,260
I fell in love with you

536
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:43,220
at first sight.

537
00:31:45,780 --> 00:31:46,820
Let's get married.

538
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,740
Okay.

539
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:05,980
Yan.

540
00:32:06,300 --> 00:32:07,060
Great news, Yan...

541
00:32:15,050 --> 00:32:15,860
Yan.

542
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:26,500
It's so hot.

543
00:32:26,860 --> 00:32:27,540
Are you okay?

544
00:32:27,820 --> 00:32:28,980
It's so hot.

545
00:32:32,540 --> 00:32:33,140
Yan.

546
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:34,900
No.

547
00:32:35,380 --> 00:32:36,420
Why?

548
00:32:36,660 --> 00:32:37,740
Aren't you hot?

549
00:32:50,700 --> 00:32:51,500
Yan.

550
00:32:57,660 --> 00:32:58,340
No!

551
00:33:16,940 --> 00:33:17,900
Li Chengxi.

552
00:33:29,620 --> 00:33:30,540
Li Chengxi.

553
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:32,020
I...

554
00:33:32,940 --> 00:33:33,980
I think

555
00:33:35,460 --> 00:33:37,340
I've fallen in love with you.

556
00:33:40,340 --> 00:33:41,220
What should I do?

557
00:33:42,740 --> 00:33:43,500
I've

558
00:33:44,820 --> 00:33:45,940
fallen in love with you too.
