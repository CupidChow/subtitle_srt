[Hello There]

00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:51,010
[Episode 15]

4
00:00:56,180 --> 00:00:57,300
Did you remember anything?

5
00:01:07,700 --> 00:01:08,820
Yes.

6
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,020
Great!

7
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:13,420
Yan.

8
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:14,940
You finally remembered.

9
00:01:15,460 --> 00:01:16,820
I did.

10
00:01:17,300 --> 00:01:18,620
You knocked me off my feet.

11
00:01:19,700 --> 00:01:21,860
You are really like what my cousin said.

12
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:24,420
Brother-in-law. My advice to you is to be a gentleman.

13
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:27,460
Otherwise, I'll teach you how to be a gentleman now.

14
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:28,500
Yan.

15
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:32,180
Mr. Li.

16
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:33,820
Please behave yourself.

17
00:01:35,140 --> 00:01:37,100
Stop harassing my fiancée!

18
00:01:41,860 --> 00:01:42,539
Let go of her!

19
00:01:45,580 --> 00:01:46,259
What?

20
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,050
You want to knock him off his feet too?

21
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:50,100
Yan.

22
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:51,340
Mr. Li.

23
00:01:52,060 --> 00:01:53,259
Yan is a naive and lively girl.

24
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:55,220
She might have offended you.

25
00:01:55,940 --> 00:01:57,060
But as a man,

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,130
how can you hurt her, a girl?

27
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:03,020
It's none of your business.

28
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:05,020
Yan is my fiancée.

29
00:02:05,300 --> 00:02:07,020
Her business is my business.

30
00:02:10,180 --> 00:02:11,260
Did you get hurt?

31
00:02:12,260 --> 00:02:12,940
I'm fine.

32
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,940
I mean before.

33
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:16,780
That's good.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,100
As long as I'm here,

35
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:19,860
I won't let him bully you again.

36
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:30,780
Let's go.

37
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:41,980
Young Master.

38
00:02:42,620 --> 00:02:43,620
It's my fault.

39
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:45,100
I failed to stall Li Jian.

40
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:46,540
It doesn't matter.

41
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:51,180
Young Master.

42
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,060
This time, the plan failed.

43
00:02:53,620 --> 00:02:55,300
What are you going to do next?

44
00:02:55,780 --> 00:02:56,620
As for the rest,

45
00:02:57,420 --> 00:02:58,579
I can do it myself.

46
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:01,180
Yes.

47
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:10,100
Dear Li.

48
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:11,300
Have something.

49
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:15,340
I heard about what happened during the day.

50
00:03:15,540 --> 00:03:16,780
Don't be too sad.

51
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:18,100
You see.

52
00:03:18,460 --> 00:03:20,450
Since Tang Buyan has already forgotten about you,

53
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:22,820
why don't you consider me?

54
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:25,140
I won't give up on her.

55
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:27,260
Please leave, Manager Shen.

56
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:31,810
Sure.

57
00:03:32,740 --> 00:03:34,060
I hope you can still be this persistent

58
00:03:34,460 --> 00:03:36,340
in a few days.

59
00:03:52,660 --> 00:03:53,300
Manager.

60
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,130
There are so many good men.

61
00:03:55,380 --> 00:03:56,750
Why does it have to be him?

62
00:03:58,180 --> 00:03:59,730
Don't you think it's so sexy

63
00:04:00,020 --> 00:04:01,180
when he turns me down?

64
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:02,100
Yes.

65
00:04:09,100 --> 00:04:10,340
He came from the sky

66
00:04:10,540 --> 00:04:13,060
and held me, and we twirled in the air.

67
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:16,339
I'm so in love!

68
00:04:23,660 --> 00:04:25,260
Dear Li.

69
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:36,620
Dear Li.

70
00:04:55,060 --> 00:04:55,850
Mr. Li.

71
00:04:57,220 --> 00:04:58,140
What do you want with my fiancée

72
00:04:58,340 --> 00:04:59,820
in the middle of the night?

73
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:03,940
A haunting ghost!

74
00:05:06,980 --> 00:05:07,940
Same to you.

75
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:43,580
Dear Li.

76
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:46,380
What are you thinking about at this late hour?

77
00:05:53,500 --> 00:05:54,780
Do you know what love is?

78
00:05:55,659 --> 00:05:56,340
Love?

79
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,860
Love is not something you say.

80
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:00,460
It's something you make.

81
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:03,260
Dear Li,

82
00:06:03,900 --> 00:06:07,260
why don't we go back to our room and discuss it?

83
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,380
You're right.

84
00:06:19,690 --> 00:06:20,460
Yan and I

85
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:23,180
have gone through life and death several times.

86
00:06:23,780 --> 00:06:24,980
The feelings between us

87
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:27,980
have long been beyond mere words.

88
00:06:31,100 --> 00:06:33,060
But she doesn't remember anything.

89
00:06:34,370 --> 00:06:35,659
Even if her memory is gone,

90
00:06:37,380 --> 00:06:38,940
our feelings are still there.

91
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:41,580
Really?

92
00:06:44,100 --> 00:06:46,659
Then why would she be so cruel to you?

93
00:06:47,540 --> 00:06:48,820
There are so many women in the world.

94
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:51,060
Why does it have to be her?

95
00:06:52,020 --> 00:06:53,260
Why don't you look at others?

96
00:06:54,140 --> 00:06:54,940
Such as me.

97
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:00,180
The night is still young.

98
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,820
Why don't we...

99
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:02,820
Manager Shen.

100
00:07:06,060 --> 00:07:07,580
Why are you so obsessed with me?

101
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:12,180
I will never give up on Yan.

102
00:07:19,100 --> 00:07:20,260
But why?

103
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:23,100
Whether it's her appearance, figure, or wealth,

104
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,620
she's nothing compared to me.

105
00:07:26,490 --> 00:07:27,820
She doesn't need to compete with anyone.

106
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,700
I like her

107
00:07:32,740 --> 00:07:34,050
because she is who she is.

108
00:07:35,730 --> 00:07:36,580
That's it.

109
00:07:52,540 --> 00:07:55,490
It's just because she's who she is.

110
00:08:08,020 --> 00:08:08,700
Fine.

111
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:10,980
I'll help you this time.

112
00:08:13,140 --> 00:08:14,900
But whether you can get Tang Buyan back

113
00:08:15,540 --> 00:08:16,780
is up to you.

114
00:08:27,650 --> 00:08:28,100
Cousin.

115
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:30,700
Brother, we need to talk.

116
00:09:03,500 --> 00:09:04,900
What are you doing here?

117
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:07,340
Yan.

118
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,820
If I can cure your blood vessel disease,

119
00:09:10,420 --> 00:09:11,860
can you not marry Li Jian?

120
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:13,780
What are you doing?

121
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:16,300
Don't blame me if you don't leave now.

122
00:09:16,370 --> 00:09:17,820
Are you really going to marry him

123
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:18,620
when you haven't retrieved your memories?

124
00:09:22,060 --> 00:09:22,860
Yan.

125
00:09:23,820 --> 00:09:24,780
Go to the Serene Valley with me.

126
00:09:26,060 --> 00:09:27,860
We'll look for the second half of the Book of Yueque.

127
00:09:28,980 --> 00:09:30,890
Maybe that book can solve your blood vessel disease.

128
00:09:31,300 --> 00:09:32,220
The Book of Yueque?

129
00:09:33,610 --> 00:09:35,140
The book

130
00:09:35,140 --> 00:09:35,900
that you stole from my house?

131
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:41,540
That book was given to me

132
00:09:42,650 --> 00:09:44,420
by you personally.

133
00:09:46,940 --> 00:09:47,860
Would you like to give it a try?

134
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,820
If not,

135
00:09:50,850 --> 00:09:52,180
I won't harass you ever again.

136
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:03,900
It looks like

137
00:10:04,620 --> 00:10:06,260
I have to make her think of me.

138
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:13,700
Do you remember

139
00:10:14,820 --> 00:10:16,140
what happened here?

140
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:36,060
Tang Buyan.

141
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:38,420
I think

142
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:41,890
I'm really falling in love with you.

143
00:10:44,850 --> 00:10:45,740
What should I do?

144
00:10:50,380 --> 00:10:51,340
Li Chengxi.

145
00:10:51,980 --> 00:10:52,780
I...

146
00:10:53,420 --> 00:10:54,580
I think

147
00:10:56,060 --> 00:10:57,860
I'm really falling in love with you.

148
00:10:58,900 --> 00:10:59,770
What should I do?

149
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:06,580
Li Chengxi.

150
00:11:07,460 --> 00:11:08,260
I...

151
00:11:08,900 --> 00:11:09,980
I think

152
00:11:11,500 --> 00:11:13,300
I'm really falling in love with you.

153
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:15,100
What should I do?

154
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:20,130
Li Chengxi.

155
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:21,700
I...

156
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:23,540
I think

157
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,900
I'm really falling in love with you.

158
00:11:27,860 --> 00:11:28,700
What should I do?

159
00:11:32,220 --> 00:11:33,020
Li Chengxi.

160
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:34,340
I...

161
00:11:34,780 --> 00:11:35,300
Yan.

162
00:11:35,460 --> 00:11:36,420
I think

163
00:11:37,900 --> 00:11:39,660
I'm really falling in love with you.

164
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:41,370
Yan.

165
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,300
Yan?

166
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:27,220
Did she have any serious illness before?

167
00:12:30,260 --> 00:12:31,170
That's it.

168
00:12:31,620 --> 00:12:33,980
She was stimulated so that the disease was triggered.

169
00:12:34,580 --> 00:12:36,340
You can't stimulate her anymore.

170
00:12:37,140 --> 00:12:40,380
Otherwise, her condition will get worse.

171
00:12:41,540 --> 00:12:43,060
And she won't live for three months.

172
00:12:51,130 --> 00:12:51,940
Boss!

173
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:55,300
Boss!

174
00:12:56,900 --> 00:12:57,700
Boss!

175
00:13:02,340 --> 00:13:03,500
Is this what you want?

176
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:05,660
You keep saying you like her.

177
00:13:06,250 --> 00:13:07,780
And you don't care about her life?

178
00:13:09,980 --> 00:13:11,340
Do you want her to remember that she loves you

179
00:13:11,460 --> 00:13:12,260
and die,

180
00:13:12,940 --> 00:13:13,700
or let her

181
00:13:13,700 --> 00:13:15,060
live happily forever.

182
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,660
If you really like Yan,

183
00:13:26,100 --> 00:13:27,020
please don't

184
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,620
show up in front of her ever again.

185
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,860
How is she?

186
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:01,780
If you want to know,

187
00:14:02,380 --> 00:14:03,340
go check her out for yourself.

188
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:06,180
What?

189
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:09,260
You are going to give up in just two days?

190
00:14:10,260 --> 00:14:11,420
I can't just watch her

191
00:14:11,420 --> 00:14:12,540
die like this.

192
00:14:14,330 --> 00:14:15,740
But it's not the first day that Tang Buyan

193
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:16,820
has had her blood vessel disease.

194
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:19,060
Brother Yan told me

195
00:14:19,980 --> 00:14:21,100
that the Book of Yueque

196
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:23,540
may cure her disease.

197
00:14:24,740 --> 00:14:26,260
But whether the second part of the book

198
00:14:26,300 --> 00:14:27,420
is in the valley

199
00:14:28,900 --> 00:14:30,380
or whether that book can cure her,

200
00:14:31,740 --> 00:14:32,700
I'm not sure.

201
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:36,500
I can't let her take the risk again.

202
00:14:38,220 --> 00:14:39,700
I couldn't wish more that you would give up on her.

203
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:41,340
Then I'll have a chance with you.

204
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:42,780
Oh, right.

205
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:45,700
This book

206
00:14:46,780 --> 00:14:47,420
is for you.

207
00:14:47,660 --> 00:14:48,370
I hope

208
00:14:48,620 --> 00:14:49,500
you won't use it.

209

No.

You can't fool me.

00:18:35,980 --> 00:18:36,770
Actually,

245
00:18:37,380 --> 00:18:39,100
I used to be a very proud person.

246
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,100
There were so many people

247
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:42,820
who wanted to be my lovers.

248
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:45,900
But I chose Li Chengxi.

249
00:18:47,460 --> 00:18:48,780
In order to get him,

250
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,460
I am even a little unscrupulous.

251
00:18:55,420 --> 00:18:56,460
But in his heart,

252
00:18:57,460 --> 00:18:59,100
there is always another girl.

253
00:19:03,900 --> 00:19:05,220
Who can say for sure

254
00:19:06,420 --> 00:19:07,860
about love?

255
00:19:14,500 --> 00:19:15,500
Life

256
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:17,460
can be long

257
00:19:18,340 --> 00:19:19,140
or short.

258
00:19:19,900 --> 00:19:21,460
It's not easy for two lovebirds

259
00:19:23,100 --> 00:19:23,900
to be together.

just make do with it.

But if it's possible,

263
00:19:35,620 --> 00:19:37,620
why don't you follow your heart?

264
00:19:51,460 --> 00:19:52,380
Can we

265
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:55,100
postpone our wedding?

266
00:19:59,180 --> 00:20:00,180
Postpone our wedding?

267
00:20:01,340 --> 00:20:01,900
Yan.

268
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,500
We're getting married tomorrow.

269
00:20:03,580 --> 00:20:04,540
Why did you suddenly...

270
00:20:05,260 --> 00:20:06,050
Li Jian.

271
00:20:06,540 --> 00:20:07,730
I've always believed that

272
00:20:08,460 --> 00:20:10,050
you were my destined one.

273
00:20:10,180 --> 00:20:12,340
I should marry you.

274
00:20:12,820 --> 00:20:14,140
But now that I think about it,

275
00:20:14,380 --> 00:20:16,180
I was being too selfish.

276
00:20:16,980 --> 00:20:17,980
You are not a tool

277
00:20:17,980 --> 00:20:19,580
to cure my blood vessel disease.

278
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:20,770
I shouldn't

279
00:20:20,900 --> 00:20:21,810
marry you

280
00:20:21,810 --> 00:20:23,580
just because you are my destined one,

281
00:20:23,980 --> 00:20:24,780
but

282
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:27,780
we have to love each other from the bottom of our hearts.

283
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:29,380
But...

284
00:20:29,660 --> 00:20:30,900
I do love you from the bottom of my heart.

285
00:20:32,900 --> 00:20:33,340
Besides,

286
00:20:33,570 --> 00:20:34,980
I never thought I was your tool.

287
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:36,730
I'm willing to

288
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:38,210
let you use me to solve your problem.

289
00:20:48,060 --> 00:20:48,860
I'm sorry.

290
00:20:49,460 --> 00:20:51,500
I promised to marry you,

291
00:20:51,860 --> 00:20:53,130
but now I have to go back on my word.

292
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:55,900
But I really appreciate you

293
00:20:55,900 --> 00:20:57,660
for helping me with my disease.

294
00:20:58,780 --> 00:20:59,580
But

295
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,140
I can't remember anything.

296
00:21:03,460 --> 00:21:04,980
For me now,

297
00:21:05,780 --> 00:21:07,340
we've only known each other for a few days.

298
00:21:09,020 --> 00:21:09,900
Can you

299
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:11,940
give me more time

300
00:21:12,500 --> 00:21:14,020
to really fall in love with you

301
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:15,580
before we get married?

302
00:21:18,500 --> 00:21:19,300
But

303
00:21:19,700 --> 00:21:20,780
your blood vessel disease...

304
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,220
Actually,

305
00:21:22,700 --> 00:21:24,010
Li Chengxi told me

306
00:21:24,540 --> 00:21:26,380
that if I can find the second half of the Book of Yueque,

307
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:27,340
maybe

308
00:21:27,570 --> 00:21:29,100
it can cure me.

309
00:21:29,690 --> 00:21:30,820
What if you can't find it?

310
00:21:31,500 --> 00:21:32,300
The doctor said

311
00:21:32,380 --> 00:21:33,660
you only have three months to live.

312
00:21:34,060 --> 00:21:34,620
Do you know

313
00:21:34,620 --> 00:21:36,260
you're playing with your life?

314
00:21:36,620 --> 00:21:37,940
Giving up before I find it.

315
00:21:38,260 --> 00:21:39,770
This is not my style.

316
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:49,180
In that case,

317
00:21:50,020 --> 00:21:50,940
I'll listen to you.

318
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:03,420
Put this over there.

00:22:44,460 --> 00:22:45,260
Why are you here?

323
00:22:45,980 --> 00:22:47,260
Didn't Li Jian tell you?

324
00:22:47,340 --> 00:22:48,820
We agreed yesterday

325
00:22:48,820 --> 00:22:50,060
to suspend the wedding.

326
00:22:50,460 --> 00:22:51,260
Well...

327
00:22:52,140 --> 00:22:53,700
I really don't know.

328
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:58,100
But you are so determined to find your destined one.

329
00:22:58,540 --> 00:22:59,810
Now that you've found him,

330
00:22:59,980 --> 00:23:01,290
why did you give up?

331
00:23:02,660 --> 00:23:04,940
Look at these accessories as well as your wedding gown.

332
00:23:05,860 --> 00:23:06,970
They are so beautiful.

No need.

No.

that you came around to the idea last night.

342
00:23:34,060 --> 00:23:34,980
You don't want to delay the wedding.

343
00:23:35,020 --> 00:23:35,940
As planned,

Okay.

I'm so happy.

Well,

you get changed first.

355

My cousin and I will wait for you outside.

Let's go.

357

Go!

358
00:24:00,970 --> 00:24:01,420
Hurry up.

Li Chengxi.

Today is my wedding day with Yan.

375
00:26:03,660 --> 00:26:04,380
What are you doing?

376
00:26:12,780 --> 00:26:13,330
Li Chengxi.

You are in love?

381
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,860
Do you dare tell Yan in her face

382
00:26:26,140 --> 00:26:28,100
that you have a clear conscience about this wedding?

383
00:26:35,900 --> 00:26:37,290
I did bribe the physician.

384
00:26:38,540 --> 00:26:39,340
So what?

385
00:26:40,060 --> 00:26:41,140
You kept harassing Yan.

386
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:42,740
Only in this way

387
00:26:43,340 --> 00:26:44,580
can I make you let her be.

388
00:26:45,460 --> 00:26:46,380
Let us be.

Where am I?

390
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:17,500
This...

391
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:20,100
Well...

392
00:27:21,380 --> 00:27:23,060
Didn't we agree not to get married?

393
00:27:23,860 --> 00:27:24,700
What happened?

394
00:27:25,900 --> 00:27:26,580
Boss.

395
00:27:27,620 --> 00:27:28,860
You were compelled?

396

Boss.

397
00:27:29,740 --> 00:27:30,540
Are you okay?

398
00:27:31,820 --> 00:27:32,500
I'm fine.

399
00:27:33,380 --> 00:27:34,180
I just

400
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:35,940
feel a little dizzy.

401
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,050
How did it happen?

402
00:27:39,860 --> 00:27:41,020
What the hell is going on here?

403
00:27:42,010 --> 00:27:43,620
Yan had been determined to postpone the wedding,

404
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,540
but she suddenly changed her mind this morning.

405
00:27:46,340 --> 00:27:47,140
During this period,

406
00:27:48,660 --> 00:27:50,140
there must have been someone who did it to her on purpose.

407
00:27:52,700 --> 00:27:53,140
Yan.

408
00:27:53,570 --> 00:27:54,220
I didn't do it.

409
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:55,820
How could I do such a thing?

410
00:28:05,700 --> 00:28:06,660
Why did you do that?

411
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:10,140
Young Master,

412
00:28:10,820 --> 00:28:12,140
are you asking me?

413
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:13,820
Of course, I'm asking you.

414
00:28:15,100 --> 00:28:16,340
Why did you compel Yan?

415
00:28:17,020 --> 00:28:17,730
Young Master.

416
00:28:18,620 --> 00:28:20,540
There must be some misunderstanding.

417
00:28:21,420 --> 00:28:22,660
I didn't compel

418
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:24,460
Miss Tang.

419
00:28:34,300 --> 00:28:35,860
I saw you sneaking around

420
00:28:36,660 --> 00:28:38,140
and eavesdropping outside Li Jian's room last night.

421
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:39,940
I knew

422
00:28:40,500 --> 00:28:41,460
you must be up to something.

423
00:28:42,260 --> 00:28:42,860
So I decided to

424
00:28:43,220 --> 00:28:44,380
wait and see.

425
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:49,580
I didn't expect that Yan would suddenly chang her mind

426
00:28:49,580 --> 00:28:50,740
and decide to get married today,

427
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:52,740
after you brought the wedding gown

428
00:28:53,420 --> 00:28:55,220
to Yan's room

429
00:28:55,780 --> 00:28:56,940
and tidied her hair.

430
00:29:00,500 --> 00:29:01,300
I'm sure

431
00:29:02,490 --> 00:29:03,660
you're the reason

432
00:29:04,380 --> 00:29:05,780
Yan suddenly changed her mind.

433
00:29:06,380 --> 00:29:07,940
I just noticed her eyes were lifeless.

434
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:08,900
So I knew

435
00:29:09,380 --> 00:29:10,860
you had done something to her.

436
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:15,220
Now I have the witness and evidence.

437
00:29:16,300 --> 00:29:17,460
What else do you want to say?

438
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,330
Young Master, I didn't.

439
00:29:21,140 --> 00:29:23,140
It's all a coincidence.

440
00:29:23,460 --> 00:29:24,380
Coincidence?

441
00:29:25,580 --> 00:29:27,340
When I tried to wake up Yan's memory,

442
00:29:27,700 --> 00:29:28,900
you destroyed my plans.

443
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:30,540
How would you explain that?

444
00:29:33,180 --> 00:29:34,700
Who ordered you to do this?

445
00:29:51,340 --> 00:29:52,140
Young Master.

446
00:29:53,380 --> 00:29:54,660
For all these years,

447
00:29:56,100 --> 00:29:57,220
you really can't

448
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:00,250
feel my feelings for you at all?

449
00:30:01,140 --> 00:30:01,900
What do you mean?

450
00:30:02,460 --> 00:30:04,220
No one ordered me to do it.

451
00:30:05,660 --> 00:30:08,180
I just don't want you to marry another woman.

452
00:30:09,180 --> 00:30:11,540
No matter if it's Shen Yi or Tang Buyan,

453
00:30:12,060 --> 00:30:12,820
they both can't.

454
00:30:15,300 --> 00:30:17,940
That's why I forced Tang Buyan to marry Li Jian.

455
00:30:19,140 --> 00:30:21,220
Because only when they are together

456
00:30:21,420 --> 00:30:23,340
can I dispel all of your thoughts about her.

457
00:30:24,620 --> 00:30:26,460
Only then can you belong to me.

458
00:30:28,180 --> 00:30:29,100
You can only

459
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:32,060
belong to me.

460
00:30:33,250 --> 00:30:34,500
At this point,

461
00:30:34,900 --> 00:30:35,980
you still want to hide it from me?

462
00:30:37,380 --> 00:30:39,740
When did you learn the sorcery to control people's minds?

463
00:30:41,060 --> 00:30:41,980
Why didn't I know?

464
00:30:46,100 --> 00:30:46,900
Ruoyu.

465
00:30:49,540 --> 00:30:51,380
You grew up on Xuanqi Mountain

466
00:30:51,940 --> 00:30:53,500
with me and Xue.

467
00:30:54,980 --> 00:30:55,820
I don't believe

468
00:30:55,820 --> 00:30:57,210
you would hurt others

469
00:30:57,210 --> 00:30:58,250
for your own benefit.

470
00:30:59,460 --> 00:31:00,660
If you have any difficulties,

471
00:31:01,380 --> 00:31:02,220
you can tell me.

472
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:04,100
We can solve it together.

473
00:31:28,340 --> 00:31:28,820
Ruoyu.

474
00:31:28,940 --> 00:31:29,340
You...

475
00:31:38,260 --> 00:31:39,180
Sir.

476
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,170
I had no choice.

477
00:31:45,220 --> 00:31:46,220
I'm sorry.

478
00:31:49,900 --> 00:31:51,100
Love

479
00:31:52,420 --> 00:31:53,860
is fake.

480
00:31:56,740 --> 00:31:57,930
But my feelings toward you

481
00:31:59,780 --> 00:32:01,540
and Second Master

482
00:32:02,580 --> 00:32:03,580
are real.

483
00:32:06,530 --> 00:32:07,900
If there is a next life,

484
00:32:09,980 --> 00:32:11,100
I hope…

485
00:32:16,820 --> 00:32:18,290
Ruoyu…

486
00:32:45,820 --> 00:32:47,340
She is also a pitiful girl.

487
00:32:48,820 --> 00:32:49,500
Yan.

488
00:32:50,420 --> 00:32:51,420
It's all my fault

489
00:32:52,140 --> 00:32:53,420
that you got hurt by Ruoyu.

490
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,290
Although Ruoyu

491
00:32:55,290 --> 00:32:56,130
compelled you,

492
00:32:56,860 --> 00:32:58,260
this wedding is my wish.

493
00:32:59,380 --> 00:33:00,660
Since we've already bowed to each other,

494
00:33:01,620 --> 00:33:02,340
why don't we

495
00:33:03,660 --> 00:33:04,860
continue the wedding?

496
00:33:06,500 --> 00:33:08,060
I told you last night

497
00:33:08,300 --> 00:33:08,940
that we would get married.

498
00:33:09,540 --> 00:33:10,380
But not now.

499
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:12,020
Besides,

500
00:33:12,580 --> 00:33:13,540
I've decided

501
00:33:14,500 --> 00:33:16,260
to go to the Serene Valley with Li Chengxi

502
00:33:16,660 --> 00:33:17,500
to find the Book of Yueque.

503
00:33:32,220 --> 00:33:32,820
Yan.

504
00:33:33,900 --> 00:33:34,820
Have you really decided to

505
00:33:35,060 --> 00:33:36,460
go to the valley with me?

506
00:33:37,900 --> 00:33:39,780
Maybe it can cure my disease.

507
00:33:40,380 --> 00:33:40,940
Okay.

508
00:33:41,820 --> 00:33:42,620
I'll definitely help you.

509
00:33:48,140 --> 00:33:48,820
Yan.

510
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:50,970
Today's wedding

511
00:33:51,140 --> 00:33:52,100
is all my fault.

512
00:33:52,860 --> 00:33:54,100
If I had found out earlier,

513
00:33:54,530 --> 00:33:55,900
we wouldn't have ended up like this.

514
00:33:57,220 --> 00:33:57,780
Li Jian.

515
00:33:58,140 --> 00:33:59,100
You don't have to blame yourself.

516
00:33:59,220 --> 00:34:00,620
It's not your fault.

517
00:34:01,180 --> 00:34:01,690
Yan.

518
00:34:02,260 --> 00:34:02,980
I've made up my mind.

519
00:34:03,340 --> 00:34:04,180
I'm willing to wait for you

520
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,540
until the day

521
00:34:06,540 --> 00:34:07,100
you really want to marry me.

522
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:08,540
You want to go to the Serene Valley.

523
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:09,900
I'll come with you.

524
00:34:12,940 --> 00:34:14,820
I'm fine though.

525
00:34:15,020 --> 00:34:15,900
Just...

526
00:34:16,610 --> 00:34:17,179
Yan.

527
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:18,489
You don't know.

528
00:34:18,580 --> 00:34:19,739
The Serene Valley is very dangerous.

529
00:34:20,020 --> 00:34:21,540
Once people outside the valley enter it, they may never come out alive.

530
00:34:21,699 --> 00:34:22,900
If you have one more person with you,

531
00:34:23,179 --> 00:34:24,020
it will be safer.

532
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:25,210
No need.

533
00:34:28,860 --> 00:34:30,179
I'll protect Yan myself.

534
00:34:32,780 --> 00:34:35,139
Li Chengxi is really skilled at martial arts.

535
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:36,219
But there are puppets

536
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:41,100
made by the Lord of the Serene Valley

537
00:34:41,699 --> 00:34:42,820
in there.

538
00:34:43,340 --> 00:34:45,420
They will attack those who trespass into the valley.

539
00:34:46,260 --> 00:34:47,100
No matter how skilled he is,

540
00:34:47,340 --> 00:34:48,940
he can't resist so many puppets.

541
00:34:50,139 --> 00:34:50,850
I

542
00:34:51,540 --> 00:34:53,900
used to spend some time in the valley,

543
00:34:54,460 --> 00:34:55,540
and I am familiar with the valley.

544
00:34:56,219 --> 00:34:58,180
So I also know how to control puppets.

545
00:34:58,860 --> 00:35:00,140
I can definitely help you.

546
00:35:00,420 --> 00:35:01,100
Really?

547
00:35:02,020 --> 00:35:02,580
But

548
00:35:02,860 --> 00:35:04,620
the Serene Valley does not allow outsiders to enter.

549
00:35:04,700 --> 00:35:06,220
How did you get in?

550
00:35:07,010 --> 00:35:08,020
Actually,

551
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,100
the Lord of the valley

552
00:35:10,610 --> 00:35:11,380
is

553
00:35:13,130 --> 00:35:13,940
my mother.

554
00:35:15,340 --> 00:35:15,900
Really?

555
00:35:17,500 --> 00:35:19,140
If that's the case you should definitely come with us.

556
00:35:19,420 --> 00:35:20,180
Maybe

557
00:35:20,420 --> 00:35:22,660
we can find the Book of Yueque without any effort.

558
00:35:27,980 --> 00:35:28,780
In that case,

559
00:35:29,780 --> 00:35:30,940
we'll set out tomorrow.

560
00:35:51,940 --> 00:35:52,740
Be careful.

561
00:35:53,050 --> 00:35:54,540
The puppets in the valley are very dangerous.

562
00:35:58,300 --> 00:36:00,450
[Serene Valley]

563
00:36:09,260 --> 00:36:09,980
They are coming.

564
00:36:17,300 --> 00:36:18,220
Why are we so unlucky?

565
00:36:18,380 --> 00:36:19,730
We met them right after we came in.

566
00:36:20,460 --> 00:36:21,060
Watch out!

567
00:36:32,660 --> 00:36:33,300
Li Jian.

568
00:36:33,780 --> 00:36:35,580
Is this the danger you mentioned?

569
00:36:37,260 --> 00:36:39,020
You made moves before I could finish.

570
00:36:40,090 --> 00:36:40,820
But

571
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:42,900
the fun is yet to come.

572
00:36:43,740 --> 00:36:44,340
Let's go.

573
00:37:03,580 --> 00:37:05,820
That color represents farming.

574
00:37:06,060 --> 00:37:07,900
What do these two colors represent?

575
00:37:08,180 --> 00:37:09,340
Are they

576
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:11,460
servants?

577
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:25,340
What happened?

578
00:37:25,660 --> 00:37:26,820
That group of puppets was so stupid just now.

579
00:37:27,140 --> 00:37:28,820
Why are they so fierce?

580
00:37:30,860 --> 00:37:32,380
The puppets in earth-colored clothes just now

581
00:37:32,380 --> 00:37:33,500
are quite low-class.

582
00:37:33,940 --> 00:37:34,820
They are not aggressive.

583
00:37:35,060 --> 00:37:36,660
They just do some odd jobs in the valley

584
00:37:36,740 --> 00:37:37,690
and are easier to control.

585
00:37:38,140 --> 00:37:39,570
And these ones in red and green clothes

586
00:37:40,020 --> 00:37:41,890
should be the more advanced ones that she has developed,

587
00:37:43,130 --> 00:37:43,980
which are more aggressive.

588
00:37:44,780 --> 00:37:45,420
But

589
00:37:45,780 --> 00:37:47,020
your mother really has nothing better to do.

590
00:37:47,300 --> 00:37:49,010
She developed so many kinds of puppets.

591
00:37:49,420 --> 00:37:51,020
Luckily, you can control them.

592
00:37:52,980 --> 00:37:53,700
Are you okay?

593
00:38:14,010 --> 00:38:15,220
Li Chengxi, watch out!

594
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,300
Why are they suddenly going crazy?

595
00:38:22,650 --> 00:38:23,940
Tell them to stop!

596
00:38:24,620 --> 00:38:25,380
I don't know why

597
00:38:25,570 --> 00:38:26,660
they suddenly lost control.

598
00:38:27,260 --> 00:38:28,340
Maybe what I learned before

599
00:38:28,580 --> 00:38:29,540
has been improved by her.

600
00:38:30,540 --> 00:38:31,260
Don't worry.

601
00:38:31,380 --> 00:38:32,220
I'll figure something out.

602
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:34,210
Be careful, Li Chengxi!

603
00:39:05,340 --> 00:39:06,540
The valley is too dangerous.

604
00:39:07,100 --> 00:39:08,060
Let's go find

605
00:39:08,180 --> 00:39:09,340
Brother Yan and Xue first.

606
00:39:10,260 --> 00:39:10,740
That's right.

607
00:39:10,940 --> 00:39:12,100
Let's hurry up and find

608
00:39:12,100 --> 00:39:13,140
the mark you mentioned.

609
00:39:13,780 --> 00:39:15,810
By the way, what does the mark look like?

610
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:16,900
It looks like Wushan.

611
00:39:17,260 --> 00:39:17,820
Wushan?

612
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:19,300
What is Wushan?

613
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:22,820
When I was fighting,

614
00:39:23,570 --> 00:39:25,380
I saw their mark on the tree.

615
00:39:35,860 --> 00:39:36,340
Here!

616
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:50,140
This thing looks so strange!
