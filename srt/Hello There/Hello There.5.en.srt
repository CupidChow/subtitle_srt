Why are you here?

00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,490
Senior sister, why are you here?

8
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:11,100
It must be a mistake.

9
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:12,550

Did you get it wrong?

13
00:01:19,940 --> 00:01:21,100
Just take a look at the wound.

14
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:27,620
How is this possible?

16
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,100
You must have hurt

yourself accidentally, right?

18
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:35,460
Was it Chang Feng?

19
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:37,180
Did you hurt yourself on purpose

20
00:01:37,460 --> 00:01:39,100
because you wanted to protect Chang Feng?

21
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:39,780
No.

22
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:41,340
This has nothing to do with Chang Feng.

23
00:01:44,820 --> 00:01:45,740

Stop asking, Yan.

26
00:01:50,780 --> 00:01:51,979

She doesn't have much inner strength.

36
00:02:07,820 --> 00:02:09,449
It doesn't seem like she got it by absorbing others' powers.

That means

38

senior sister is not the murderer?

39
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:14,380
If it's not her, why did she admit to it?

40

It must be her.

Yes.

The murderer must be Chang Feng.

46
00:02:22,340 --> 00:02:24,060

Why did you draw it like this?

I've loved Sishi since I was young.

But compared to being with him,

what I wanted more was for him to be able to resolve his blood vessel issues

So I followed our ancestral teachings,

and looked everywhere for Teardrop Mole women.

00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:11,140
we found a book

177
00:11:11,140 --> 00:11:12,860
called the Book of Yueque.

178
00:11:14,780 --> 00:11:15,700
The Book of Yueque?

179
00:11:16,620 --> 00:11:17,260
That's right.

180
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:19,460
I guess this Book of Yueque

181
00:11:19,820 --> 00:11:21,540
was left by the ancestors of the Tang family

182
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:22,980
and can help extend one's life.

183
00:11:23,620 --> 00:11:24,660
Since the Teardrop Mole people

184
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:26,420
were the key to solving the blood vessel issue,

185
00:11:26,900 --> 00:11:28,500
then perhaps, if you absorb the power of a Teardrop Mole person,

186
00:11:28,700 --> 00:11:29,740
you could extend your life.

187
00:11:31,380 --> 00:11:32,540
So, you...

188
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,610
Brother.

189
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:39,780
They really have the Book of Yueque.

190
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,300
We should snatch it.

191
00:11:45,620 --> 00:11:47,660
Initially, your brother didn't agree to it.

192
00:11:48,460 --> 00:11:49,530
I convinced him

193
00:11:50,220 --> 00:11:53,220
to absorb 10% of each person's power every time.

194
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:55,780
He reluctantly agreed

195
00:11:56,460 --> 00:11:57,860
because he couldn't bear to leave us both.

196
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:02,460
He did live past 25 years old,

197
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,020
but he's aging every day.

198
00:12:07,020 --> 00:12:07,900
Sometimes,

199
00:12:09,060 --> 00:12:10,300
he would get worried about you,

200
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:12,980
and would even visit you secretly.

201
00:12:32,780 --> 00:12:33,300
Brother.

202
00:12:33,380 --> 00:12:35,260
You've been by my side all this time.

203
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,780
If he only absorbed 10% of their power,

204
00:12:39,900 --> 00:12:41,340
where did those mummies come from?

205
00:12:41,900 --> 00:12:42,980
10% of their power

206
00:12:43,420 --> 00:12:45,420
wasn't enough to maintain Sishi's life.

207
00:12:46,180 --> 00:12:47,100
And even if I let

208
00:12:47,180 --> 00:12:48,170
those Teardrop Mole people go,

209
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:50,180
it would only ruin Tang Sect's reputation.

210
00:12:50,340 --> 00:12:50,890
So,

211
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:54,780
I sucked them dry.

212
00:12:56,370 --> 00:12:57,100
At first,

213
00:12:58,100 --> 00:12:58,940
one Teardrop Mole person

214
00:13:00,540 --> 00:13:02,540
could sustain Sishi for a year.

215
00:13:03,780 --> 00:13:05,220
But as time went by,

216
00:13:06,780 --> 00:13:08,700
he aged faster

217
00:13:08,770 --> 00:13:09,790
and faster.

218
00:13:11,260 --> 00:13:12,660
I had to take risks

219
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:16,020
and kill people nearby.

220
00:13:16,900 --> 00:13:17,370
Yan.

221
00:13:18,580 --> 00:13:19,260
I just didn't expect

222
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:20,860
that you would get sucked into this.

223
00:13:21,660 --> 00:13:23,100
You don't want to get her involved,

224
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:24,900
so you tried to frame us?

225
00:13:25,220 --> 00:13:26,210
In that case,

226
00:13:26,780 --> 00:13:29,100
why did you fight with Chief Tang just now?

227
00:13:29,860 --> 00:13:31,380
I just wanted to pass my power and skills

228
00:13:31,420 --> 00:13:32,340
to Sishi.

229
00:13:34,610 --> 00:13:35,340
I just

230
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:38,220
want him to live for a few more days.

231
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:41,380
Senior sister.

232
00:13:45,180 --> 00:13:45,820
Yan.

233
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,490
We didn't tell you

234
00:13:49,380 --> 00:13:50,500
because we don't want

235
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:51,940
these sins and pain

236
00:13:52,460 --> 00:13:53,530
to affect your life.

237
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:56,300
Your brother and I just hope

238
00:13:56,860 --> 00:13:57,820
that our Yan

239
00:13:58,460 --> 00:13:59,740
can live simply and

240
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:02,060
happily forever.

241
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,130
But...

242
00:14:06,980 --> 00:14:09,060
But I really want to share your burden.

243
00:14:09,460 --> 00:14:10,060
Senior sister,

244
00:14:10,900 --> 00:14:12,380
I know you are kind by nature.

245
00:14:12,780 --> 00:14:13,420
Everything you did

246
00:14:13,420 --> 00:14:15,180
was to save my brother.

247
00:14:15,370 --> 00:14:15,940
But...

248
00:14:16,650 --> 00:14:18,500
But we can't exchange others' lives

249
00:14:18,500 --> 00:14:19,810
for our own.

250
00:14:20,540 --> 00:14:21,860
If my brother knew,

251
00:14:22,300 --> 00:14:24,460
he wouldn't agree to it.

252
00:14:25,580 --> 00:14:27,500
I know I've committed a grave sin.

253
00:14:29,020 --> 00:14:30,060
I can't be forgiven.

254
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:35,220
I'm sorry.

255
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:39,100
It's all my fault.

256
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:40,540
Brother.

257
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:42,580
You're awake.

258
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:48,180
I heard

259
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:50,180
everything you said.

260
00:15:07,660 --> 00:15:08,460
Yan.

261
00:15:09,580 --> 00:15:10,650
If it weren't for me,

262
00:15:11,820 --> 00:15:14,220
she wouldn't have done so many wrong things.

263
00:15:16,260 --> 00:15:17,260
Actually,

264
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:20,460
I deserve to die.

265
00:15:21,580 --> 00:15:22,180
Brother.

266
00:15:35,050 --> 00:15:35,820
Junior sister.

267
00:15:38,940 --> 00:15:39,820
Let me go.

268
00:15:43,180 --> 00:15:43,850
Truth be told,

269
00:15:45,980 --> 00:15:47,380
I'm tired of this.

270
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:49,300
Living in this underground palace,

271
00:15:50,060 --> 00:15:52,380
dragging out my existence.

272
00:15:55,700 --> 00:15:56,100
Sishi.

273
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:56,540
Brother.

274
00:15:59,820 --> 00:16:00,620
After all,

275
00:16:02,370 --> 00:16:04,300
me not being able to leave you

276
00:16:06,860 --> 00:16:07,940
brought harm to

277
00:16:08,860 --> 00:16:10,900
so many innocent lives.

278
00:16:24,760 --> 00:16:27,700
[Tang Sect]

279
00:16:41,380 --> 00:16:41,900
How is it?

280
00:16:42,180 --> 00:16:43,500
Do you like your birthday gift?

281
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:49,900
Isn't this my favorite wolf tooth necklace?

282
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,500
You actually managed to make it?

283
00:16:52,580 --> 00:16:53,780
You're the best.

284
00:16:56,370 --> 00:16:56,940
Brother.

285
00:16:57,780 --> 00:16:58,660
What's wrong?

286
00:16:59,420 --> 00:16:59,940
I'm fine.

287
00:17:00,220 --> 00:17:00,940
It's just a minor injury.

288
00:17:04,220 --> 00:17:07,220
If I didn't ask for this gift,

289
00:17:07,819 --> 00:17:10,339
you wouldn't have taken the risk to kill the Snow Wolf.

290
00:17:11,700 --> 00:17:12,500
It's okay.

291
00:17:13,220 --> 00:17:14,060
Our Yan

292
00:17:14,420 --> 00:17:16,140
deserves only the best.

293
00:17:16,940 --> 00:17:17,460
Look.

294
00:17:18,180 --> 00:17:19,819
I made the same one for myself.

295
00:17:20,180 --> 00:17:22,180
From now on, this is our token.

296
00:17:22,540 --> 00:17:24,460
It will always be with you, just like I will.

297
00:17:25,700 --> 00:17:26,099
Here.

298
00:17:26,180 --> 00:17:27,260
Let me put it on for you.

299
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:31,380
Do you like it?

300
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:02,940
When I was born,

301
00:18:04,340 --> 00:18:05,730
my father was nearly 25 years old.

302
00:18:07,020 --> 00:18:08,050
After he died,

303
00:18:09,140 --> 00:18:10,340
my mother was so sad

304
00:18:11,220 --> 00:18:12,300
that she left with him.

305
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,780
I don't even know what they look like.

306
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:18,140
My brother raised me.

307
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:24,010
He is the best brother in the world.

308
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:29,540
For as long as I can remember, I've known

309
00:18:30,060 --> 00:18:32,420
that all members of the Tang family can't live past 25 years old.

310
00:18:34,500 --> 00:18:35,340
One day,

311
00:18:35,540 --> 00:18:37,820
my brother will leave me like my father did.

312
00:18:39,820 --> 00:18:40,500
So,

313
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:42,730
I've been working hard

314
00:18:43,740 --> 00:18:44,980
to live happily

315
00:18:45,780 --> 00:18:48,340
like they hoped.

316
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,020
I've tried hard to find the Destined One

317
00:18:51,420 --> 00:18:53,380
from our ancestral teachings.

318
00:18:55,820 --> 00:18:57,220
But why does the Tang family

319
00:18:57,220 --> 00:18:58,620
have to bear such a fate?

320
00:18:59,900 --> 00:19:02,140
Why did my brother leave me again?

321
00:19:03,620 --> 00:19:05,380
Is there really no other way

322
00:19:05,850 --> 00:19:08,020
to save my brother besides absorbing others' power?

323
00:19:13,340 --> 00:19:14,140
So,

324
00:19:14,380 --> 00:19:16,500
your power will cause these plants to age.

325
00:19:16,860 --> 00:19:18,100
And the power that I produce

326
00:19:18,460 --> 00:19:19,740
can reverse that.

327
00:19:23,940 --> 00:19:24,740
Do you remember

328
00:19:25,460 --> 00:19:27,340
that my power of hypnotization, when used by you,

329
00:19:27,740 --> 00:19:28,970
can reverse the withering of plants?

330
00:19:29,740 --> 00:19:31,220
If you could use it on people,

331
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:33,860
would it make them younger?

332
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:36,260
Really?

333
00:19:37,260 --> 00:19:38,020
Li Chengxi.

334
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,500
You can help me, right?

335
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:42,300
But I'm not sure if it'll work.

336
00:19:42,700 --> 00:19:44,060
What if it makes things worse?

337
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:44,900
No.

338
00:19:46,460 --> 00:19:48,260
Nothing can be worse than this.

339
00:19:50,460 --> 00:19:52,340
Even if there's only a one in a thousand chance,

340
00:19:52,930 --> 00:19:53,900
I still want to try.

341
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:32,440
♫Is it right or wrong to let go♫

342
00:20:33,950 --> 00:20:39,330
♫With a heart beating warm but pretending to be cold♫

343
00:20:40,070 --> 00:20:42,360
♫Whether I lose you or keep you♫

344
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:48,060
♫We can't escape the torture♫

♫Thousand years of reincarnation is too confusing♫

♫Closing my eyes♫

♫Reaching out and touching with my hands♫

♫The mockery of fate, how difficult it is♫

Brother!

352
00:21:15,460 --> 00:21:16,020
Brother.

353
00:21:17,180 --> 00:21:17,900
Sishi.

354
00:21:18,250 --> 00:21:19,860
You really became younger.

♫The more you want to escape♫

359

Brother.

Brother!

366

Brother.

367
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:38,660
It must be because I wasn't strong enough just now.

368
00:21:39,220 --> 00:21:39,980
Let's try again.

369

Let's try again.

Yan.

371
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,020

Don't worry.

Brother.

383
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:01,060

Don't be bound by

408
00:23:18,500 --> 00:23:20,340
the blood vessel issue, like your brother.

409
00:23:22,100 --> 00:23:22,820
Regarding the Destined One,

410
00:23:23,980 --> 00:23:24,860
don't force it.

411
00:23:27,820 --> 00:23:29,420
If you don't meet the Destined One,

412
00:23:30,540 --> 00:23:32,130
but you meet the one you love,

413

don't miss him.

I'm sorry.

00:24:47,570 --> 00:24:49,250
I regret it, Sishi.

427
00:24:52,860 --> 00:24:54,700
We wasted too much time.

428
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:58,420
In the next life,

429
00:25:01,380 --> 00:25:03,900
we must be together.

430
00:25:18,820 --> 00:25:19,500
Yan.

431
00:25:22,050 --> 00:25:22,740
The kite...

432
00:25:24,180 --> 00:25:25,020
is going to break.

433
00:26:23,260 --> 00:26:23,860
Brother.

434
00:26:24,620 --> 00:26:25,380
Don't worry.

435
00:26:26,300 --> 00:26:28,250
I will solve the blood issue of the Tang family

Chief Lan,

what's going on?

439

My lord,

440
00:26:54,260 --> 00:26:56,820
I asked you here today to tell you that

441
00:26:59,260 --> 00:27:00,860
I'm the murderer of the mummies.

442
00:27:05,820 --> 00:27:07,140
What's going on?

443
00:27:07,900 --> 00:27:10,260
I really don't understand this time.

444
00:27:11,740 --> 00:27:13,500
In order to save my beloved,

445
00:27:14,740 --> 00:27:16,300
I absorbed their strength

446
00:27:17,460 --> 00:27:19,260
and framed the two from Xuanqi Mountain.

447
00:27:20,300 --> 00:27:21,540
This has nothing to do with anyone else.

448
00:27:23,700 --> 00:27:24,420
Chief Lan,

449
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:26,500
what can I say?

450
00:27:26,620 --> 00:27:27,180
You...

451
00:27:27,260 --> 00:27:28,180
You are so foolish.

452
00:27:28,660 --> 00:27:29,980
You killed so many people

453
00:27:30,250 --> 00:27:31,420
just for your personal desires.

454
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:34,860
If the former chief knew you were like this before he died,

455
00:27:35,140 --> 00:27:36,660
he wouldn't have died in peace.

456
00:27:36,900 --> 00:27:37,500
My lord,

457
00:27:38,260 --> 00:27:39,460
I started this.

458
00:27:40,460 --> 00:27:41,810
I should end it.

459
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:50,540
This...

460
00:27:51,300 --> 00:27:52,580
Senior sister.

461
00:27:55,820 --> 00:27:56,460
Senior sister!

462
00:27:56,940 --> 00:27:57,820
Senior sister!

463
00:27:58,380 --> 00:27:59,460
Senior sister.

464
00:28:00,090 --> 00:28:01,770
Why are you so silly?

465
00:28:03,340 --> 00:28:04,140
I know

466
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:06,300
I've sinned.

467
00:28:07,740 --> 00:28:08,780
Even if I die,

468
00:28:10,420 --> 00:28:11,820
it's hard for me to pay for my sins.

469
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:13,500
Senior sister.

470
00:28:15,540 --> 00:28:16,340
Yan.

471
00:28:17,940 --> 00:28:20,220
I haven't told you something.

472
00:28:21,700 --> 00:28:23,940
The doctor said the progression of your blood vessel disease is ahead of schedule.

473
00:28:25,660 --> 00:28:27,460
You can't live past the age of 25.

474
00:28:28,420 --> 00:28:29,260
Senior sister,

475
00:28:30,180 --> 00:28:31,380
stop talking.

476
00:28:32,340 --> 00:28:33,620
Stop it.

477
00:28:34,700 --> 00:28:36,500
Live well.

478
00:28:38,100 --> 00:28:39,220
From now on,

479
00:28:40,580 --> 00:28:42,380
I won't be with you anymore.

480
00:28:44,380 --> 00:28:45,380
Senior sister.

481
00:28:45,780 --> 00:28:46,900
Senior sister.

482
00:28:47,980 --> 00:28:49,050
Sishi,

483
00:28:50,820 --> 00:28:52,140
I'm coming to be with you.

484
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,060
In this life,

485
00:28:56,740 --> 00:28:58,500
we'll go to the netherworld together.

486
00:29:00,020 --> 00:29:00,820
In the next life,

487
00:29:02,900 --> 00:29:04,620
we will be together forever.

488
00:29:07,540 --> 00:29:08,100
We will never

489
00:29:10,780 --> 00:29:11,980
be apart.

490
00:29:15,060 --> 00:29:17,220
Senior sister!

491
00:29:17,820 --> 00:29:18,980
Senior sister!

492
00:29:19,740 --> 00:29:20,810
Senior sister!

493
00:29:28,980 --> 00:29:29,820
Senior sister.

494
00:29:38,740 --> 00:29:40,020
I know everything

495
00:29:40,460 --> 00:29:42,860
there is to know about this world.

496
00:29:43,260 --> 00:29:44,820
But I really don't understand

497
00:29:45,980 --> 00:29:48,060
feelings and relationships.

498
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:05,620
My brother and senior sister have left.

499
00:30:06,260 --> 00:30:07,220
From now on,

500
00:30:07,620 --> 00:30:10,300
I'm really alone.

501
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:14,020
I'm really alone.

502
00:30:50,780 --> 00:30:52,010
What are you doing?

503
00:30:52,420 --> 00:30:53,050
Senior Chang.

504
00:30:53,490 --> 00:30:55,300
Boss and senior sister are dealing with some family matters inside.

505
00:30:55,740 --> 00:30:56,650
You can't go in.

506
00:30:56,820 --> 00:30:57,660
Family matters?

507
00:31:00,780 --> 00:31:02,300
Then why are they in there?

508
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:07,300
I want to see senior sister.

509
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:09,250
She said

510
00:31:09,250 --> 00:31:11,340
the Young Mistress was bewitched by the Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain.

511
00:31:11,820 --> 00:31:12,900
Now, I can't go in

512
00:31:13,020 --> 00:31:13,980
but they are inside.

513
00:31:14,180 --> 00:31:15,300
What are you trying to do?

514
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:16,380
Boss said

515
00:31:16,610 --> 00:31:17,700
no one can go in.

516
00:31:17,860 --> 00:31:18,260
You...

517
00:31:39,730 --> 00:31:40,340
Brother.

518
00:31:41,460 --> 00:31:43,460
The ugly monster is especially ugly today.

519
00:31:44,140 --> 00:31:45,610
You better not die before me.

520
00:31:46,620 --> 00:31:48,460
I don't want to turn into this.

521
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:51,460
Boss,

522
00:31:53,060 --> 00:31:54,180
You've been like this all day.

523
00:31:56,420 --> 00:31:57,540
Go back now.

524
00:31:58,100 --> 00:31:58,940
If you continue being like this,

525
00:32:00,330 --> 00:32:02,220
senior sister and Chief will be sad too.

526
00:32:03,180 --> 00:32:03,940
Yes, Boss.

527
00:32:04,860 --> 00:32:07,660
You can't take it if you kneel like this for the whole day.

528
00:32:11,180 --> 00:32:11,740
Ugly monster.

529
00:32:12,940 --> 00:32:13,740
Don't be like this.

530
00:32:15,420 --> 00:32:16,220
It's no big deal,

531
00:32:17,330 --> 00:32:18,860
I'll give you my title - the great devil.

532
00:32:28,340 --> 00:32:28,860
Boss.

533
00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:32,660
Leave her to me.

534
00:32:32,980 --> 00:32:34,100
I'll take her back to rest.

535
00:32:34,740 --> 00:32:35,620
It's improper for men and women to touch each other.

536
00:32:38,370 --> 00:32:39,860
Isn't he also a man?

537
00:32:56,340 --> 00:32:57,050
Brother.

538
00:32:58,180 --> 00:32:58,900
Senior sister.

539
00:33:00,500 --> 00:33:01,020
Brother.

540
00:33:03,620 --> 00:33:04,260
Senior sister.

541
00:33:06,140 --> 00:33:06,530
Brother.

542
00:33:06,700 --> 00:33:07,370
Senior sister.

543
00:33:09,300 --> 00:33:09,780
Brother!

544
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:11,060
Don't go.

545
00:33:12,340 --> 00:33:12,900
Brother.

546
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:15,460
Don't leave me alone.

547
00:33:18,980 --> 00:33:19,500
Brother.

548
00:33:23,330 --> 00:33:24,140
Don't go.

549
00:33:36,620 --> 00:33:37,140
I won't go.

550
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:42,940
What did you say?

551
00:33:45,580 --> 00:33:47,780
Senior sister passed away?

552
00:33:56,300 --> 00:33:59,700
The Double Demons of Xuanqi Mountain must have killed my senior sister.

553
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:02,780
And Young Mistress,

554
00:34:05,140 --> 00:34:07,140
you lured a wolves into the house.

555
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:10,659
Do you want to avenge your senior sister?

556
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:15,580
I can help you kill the enemy

557
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:19,020
or

558
00:34:19,420 --> 00:34:20,780
seize the position of Chief.
