[Episode 17]

4
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:14,700
I've seen stupid people,

5
00:01:15,100 --> 00:01:17,500
but I've never seen anyone as stupid as these four.

6
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:20,100
They knocked themselves out.

7
00:01:21,660 --> 00:01:22,780
They may be stupid,

8
00:01:23,780 --> 00:01:24,900
but why do I

9
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:26,980
like them so much?

10
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:34,300
Especially this sweet young thing.

11
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:36,979
In the end, he risked his life

12
00:01:36,979 --> 00:01:38,020
to save the ugly girl.

13
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:39,500
Not bad.

14
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:43,539
Much better than my idiot son.

15
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,460
This guy clearly likes the ugly girl.

16
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,090
I'm in a good mood today.

17
00:01:53,090 --> 00:01:54,770
I'll set you up

18
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:58,420
so that you lovers can be together.

19
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:22,140
Good morning, Li Chengxi.

20
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,940
Oh no, Li Chengxi! We've been ambushed!

21
00:02:36,100 --> 00:02:36,900
Li Chengxi.

22
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,100
What's so interesting about this puppet?

23
00:02:43,700 --> 00:02:44,140
This...

24
00:02:45,220 --> 00:02:46,300
is a living person?

25
00:02:53,860 --> 00:02:54,380
Xue.

26
00:02:55,140 --> 00:02:56,180
So the little ghost that I saw

27
00:02:56,180 --> 00:02:57,540
last night was him?

28
00:02:58,450 --> 00:02:59,140
Yan.

29
00:02:59,700 --> 00:03:00,860
This is my brother, Yun Gaixue.

30
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,860
And that is...

31
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:10,820
Doctor Yan.

32
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:20,420
Li.

33
00:03:23,300 --> 00:03:24,100
Why are you here?

34
00:03:28,660 --> 00:03:29,220
I...

35
00:03:34,579 --> 00:03:35,250
Yan.

36
00:03:35,660 --> 00:03:36,660
Check on Xue.

37
00:03:57,020 --> 00:03:58,460
Oh my god, you little black thing.

38
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,660
Why did you paint your face so dark?

39
00:04:05,660 --> 00:04:06,060
Yeah.

40
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:08,300
It's a skill to be able to paint your face so dark.

41
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:09,420
Li Chengxi,

42
00:04:09,820 --> 00:04:10,740
do you have a handkerchief?

43
00:04:10,900 --> 00:04:11,820
I want to wipe my face too.

44
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,940
Your face is clean. You don't need to wipe it.

45
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:21,380
Physician Yan, what are you doing?

46
00:04:23,170 --> 00:04:24,420
The Serene Valley is full of danger.

47
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,700
Let me check your pulse for you

48
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:26,780
in case you've been poisoned.

49
00:04:32,010 --> 00:04:33,460
Don't talk about Yan's dark face.

50
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:42,020
Tang Buyan.

51
00:04:42,500 --> 00:04:43,300
What happened?

52
00:04:43,780 --> 00:04:44,610
Did you lose your memory?

53
00:04:44,980 --> 00:04:45,890
Lost her memory?

54
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:48,060
How can you tell?

55
00:04:49,180 --> 00:04:49,980
Brother Yan,

56
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:51,900
Yan did lose her memory.

57
00:04:52,460 --> 00:04:53,250
Is there any solution?

58
00:04:54,580 --> 00:04:55,700
She took an amnesia pill.

59
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:57,620
This pill has no antidote.

60
00:04:59,420 --> 00:05:00,220
However,

61
00:05:00,980 --> 00:05:02,620
if someone important to her

62
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,300
gives her some external stimulation,

63
00:05:04,540 --> 00:05:05,420
it might help.

64
00:05:05,420 --> 00:05:06,540
External stimulation?

65
00:05:07,300 --> 00:05:09,460
Ugly monster, why don't I punch you?

66
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:10,340
What do you think?

67
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:12,260
This might help you recover your memory.

68
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:12,820
Get lost.

69
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:22,620
It's getting late.

70
00:05:22,890 --> 00:05:23,980
Let's get something to eat.

71
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:44,940
Yun Gaixue.

72
00:05:45,500 --> 00:05:47,250
Why do you keep smiling at me?

73
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:49,900
Is there something on my face?

74
00:05:49,980 --> 00:05:51,020
No.

75
00:05:54,409 --> 00:05:55,220
Ugly monster.

76
00:05:55,420 --> 00:05:57,300
I've thought about something for a long time.

77
00:05:57,460 --> 00:05:58,740
I've decided to tell you.

78
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:04,740
Go ahead.

79
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,260
Let me punch you.

80
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,780
I can definitely cure your memory loss.

81
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,220
Get lost!

82
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:11,260
Trust me.

83
00:06:11,260 --> 00:06:12,060
It will definitely work.

84
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:13,660
If one punch doesn't work, let's do two punches.

85
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:15,980
Why don't you let me punch you?

86
00:06:15,980 --> 00:06:17,860
Maybe it can help your brain.

87
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,500
My brain is normal,

88
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:21,140
unlike yours.

89
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:21,780
I...

90
00:06:30,740 --> 00:06:31,340
You...

91
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:39,860
Brother Yan.

92
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,300
Why is Yan's face black?

93
00:06:43,900 --> 00:06:45,820
I went to the cave you mentioned just now

94
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:48,300
and found a pool of black blood inside.

95
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,020
Miss Tang must have been infected after touching the blood,

96
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:52,500
worsening her blood vessel disease.

97
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:55,620
Is there any solution?

98
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:56,500
This...

99
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:06,820
Xue.

100
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:08,300
Where's Yan?

101
00:07:08,700 --> 00:07:10,140
She went to the bathroom.

102
00:07:10,820 --> 00:07:12,300
Why isn't she back yet?

103
00:07:12,580 --> 00:07:13,180
Oh no.

104
00:07:16,140 --> 00:07:17,580
This Yun Gaixue

105
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:19,460
is always laughing at me

106
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:21,060
but won't tell me what's on my face.

107
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,740
There are so many puppets in the Serene Valley.

108
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,620
Could these puppets infect humans?

109
00:07:38,690 --> 00:07:40,260
I'm already infected, right?

110
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,740
Yan.

111
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:03,420
This is a tranquilizing pill.

112
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:05,300
It can protect her heart.

113
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:13,220
Physician Yan,

114
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,660
why is my face so dark?

115
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,020
What happened?

116
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,340
Did I really get infected?

117
00:08:18,340 --> 00:08:19,820
Have I turned into a puppet?

118
00:08:19,890 --> 00:08:20,900
I'm still young.

119
00:08:21,140 --> 00:08:23,020
I don't want to be a puppet.

120
00:08:23,620 --> 00:08:25,140
If you really became a puppet,

121
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:26,340
it's not that bad.

122
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:28,140
You'll be immortal.

123
00:08:28,490 --> 00:08:29,860
Your blood vessel issues would be resolved.

124
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:31,740
Physician Yan, you're still joking

125
00:08:31,860 --> 00:08:33,419
in such a situation.

126
00:08:35,419 --> 00:08:36,059
Yan.

127
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:38,740
The puppets in Serene Valley are made of wood.

128
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:39,980
They can't infect humans.

129
00:08:40,980 --> 00:08:41,900
Your symptoms

130
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,820
are caused by the aggravation of your blood vessel disease.

131
00:08:47,420 --> 00:08:49,180
Aggravation?

132
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,780
Am I going to die soon?

133
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:53,780
Why is my life so miserable?

134
00:08:55,140 --> 00:08:55,780
Actually,

135
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,220
why don't we try

136
00:08:57,460 --> 00:08:59,940
using the martial skills from the Book of Yueque and the Book of Xincan?

137
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:03,660
We're already at rock bottom.

138
00:09:05,460 --> 00:09:06,740
It's our last hope.

139
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:08,220
Let's try it.

140
00:09:30,820 --> 00:09:32,660
What happened to the ugly little girl and the sweet young thing?

141
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,060
Master, they are still the same.

142
00:09:35,300 --> 00:09:36,100
There's no progress.

143
00:09:36,260 --> 00:09:36,820
What?

144
00:09:38,900 --> 00:09:41,340
I even made them hug.

145
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,100
How could that have been useless?

146
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:51,420
That sweet young thing

147
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:53,260
has such a handsome face.

148
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:57,420
Why isn't the ugly girl tempted?

149
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:02,250
You idiot.

150
00:10:02,620 --> 00:10:04,540
You've been so gallant and protective.

151
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,250
You've done so much,

152
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,020
but you didn't say anything sweet.

153
00:10:08,020 --> 00:10:08,860
What's the use of all that?

154
00:10:11,100 --> 00:10:14,140
I have to do it myself after all.

155
00:10:31,860 --> 00:10:32,700
Li Chengxi.

156
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:33,940
What are you doing?

157
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,140
Li Chengxi, I'm allergic to this.

158
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:08,180
Take it away.

159
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:16,100
Woman.

160
00:11:17,060 --> 00:11:19,260
You've managed to get my attention.

161
00:11:19,900 --> 00:11:21,060
Are you crazy?

162
00:11:26,300 --> 00:11:27,940
I've done so much for you.

163
00:11:28,140 --> 00:11:29,460
Don't you understand?

164
00:11:30,300 --> 00:11:32,740
Or would you only understand my heart

165
00:11:33,620 --> 00:11:35,540
if I commit myself to you?

166
00:11:36,450 --> 00:11:38,260
What are you doing?

167
00:11:54,500 --> 00:11:55,420
Li Chengxi.

168
00:11:56,020 --> 00:11:57,820
You're here. What's this?

169
00:11:58,140 --> 00:11:58,860
I didn't expect

170
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:00,660
that the Lord of the Valley made

171
00:12:00,700 --> 00:12:01,940
a puppet that looks exactly like me.

172
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:05,060
Yan, are you okay?

173
00:12:05,300 --> 00:12:06,220
Are you hurt?

174
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:08,260
I'm fine.

175
00:12:09,180 --> 00:12:11,900
Since the Lord made a puppet like you,

176
00:12:11,940 --> 00:12:12,860
could it be that

177
00:12:13,010 --> 00:12:15,340
Yun Gaixue and Physician Yan are fake too?

178
00:12:17,500 --> 00:12:18,220
No.

179
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,180
Let's check again.

180
00:12:21,260 --> 00:12:22,180
Just in case.

181
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:32,300
What?

182
00:12:33,260 --> 00:12:35,100
You think I'm a puppet?

183
00:12:35,620 --> 00:12:36,420
Li Chengxi.

184
00:12:36,940 --> 00:12:37,460
You're just letting

185
00:12:37,460 --> 00:12:38,890
this ugly monster mess around like that?

186
00:12:39,820 --> 00:12:41,380
It's not that difficult.

187
00:12:41,700 --> 00:12:42,780
We just need to ask a few questions

188
00:12:42,780 --> 00:12:44,860
that only we know the answers to.

189
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:47,260
If you can answer it, you're definitely not a puppet.

190
00:12:47,340 --> 00:12:49,460
You lost your memory. How would you know?

191
00:12:49,660 --> 00:12:51,820
I have amnesia, not dementia.

192
00:12:52,180 --> 00:12:53,140
I've confirmed these questions

193
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,380
with your brother.

194
00:12:55,660 --> 00:12:56,620
They will definitely confirm

195
00:12:56,620 --> 00:12:58,060
if you're really Yun Gaixue.

196
00:12:59,340 --> 00:13:00,020
Fine.

197
00:13:00,020 --> 00:13:01,700
Since my brother has agreed, go ahead.

198
00:13:03,100 --> 00:13:04,060
First question.

199
00:13:06,300 --> 00:13:08,260
Do you use your left or right hand to pick your nose?

200
00:13:09,740 --> 00:13:11,140
What kind of question is that?

201
00:13:11,380 --> 00:13:13,620
It's exactly the same answer that your brother predicted.

202
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:15,220
Question two.

203
00:13:15,980 --> 00:13:17,540
If you forget to bring tissues to the toilet,

204
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:19,420
would you use your fingers or your underpants?

205
00:13:19,500 --> 00:13:20,930
Do you want to die?

206
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:22,180
Bingo, again!

207
00:13:24,300 --> 00:13:25,020
The third question.

208
00:13:25,100 --> 00:13:26,220
Who is your brother's grandmother's

209
00:13:26,260 --> 00:13:27,450
grandson's nephew's

210
00:13:27,500 --> 00:13:29,100
fourth aunt's third grandaunt to you?

211
00:13:37,620 --> 00:13:38,740
You've gotten all of them right.

212
00:13:39,100 --> 00:13:40,540
You're indeed brothers.

213
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:42,060
You have complementary IQ.

214
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:43,180
Of course.

215
00:13:43,180 --> 00:13:45,140
My brother and I are the closest.

216
00:13:45,660 --> 00:13:46,940
Since you've asked me,

217
00:13:46,940 --> 00:13:48,420
shouldn't you ask this maniac?

218
00:13:48,860 --> 00:13:49,500
Go ahead.

219
00:13:57,060 --> 00:13:58,340
Li Chengxi, what are you doing?

220
00:13:59,540 --> 00:14:01,740
Brother Yan knows I won't hurt him.

221
00:14:01,940 --> 00:14:02,770
Since you didn't hide,

222
00:14:03,500 --> 00:14:04,900
it must be you.

223
00:14:05,780 --> 00:14:07,020
I thought you were going to say that

224
00:14:07,220 --> 00:14:08,580
this maniac is a weakling,

225
00:14:08,580 --> 00:14:10,100
and would never be able to escape your whip.

226
00:14:14,220 --> 00:14:16,340
All right, we shouldn't stay here for long.

227
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:18,780
We need to get Yan's face back to normal as soon as possible

228
00:14:19,340 --> 00:14:20,540
and find the Book of Yueque.

229
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:25,780
It failed!

230
00:14:27,020 --> 00:14:28,100
It was almost successful,

231
00:14:28,540 --> 00:14:30,020
but Li Chengxi came and made trouble.

232
00:14:35,420 --> 00:14:37,180
I was helping them,

233
00:14:37,500 --> 00:14:38,820
but they didn't appreciate it.

234
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:42,780
Looks like

235
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,650
I need to try harder.

236
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:47,580
This time,

237
00:14:50,660 --> 00:14:53,460
they won't be able to escape.

238
00:15:49,060 --> 00:15:49,660
Yan.

239
00:16:01,420 --> 00:16:02,660
Her face is back to normal.

240
00:16:03,220 --> 00:16:04,300
She's fine now.

241
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,340
That's good.

242
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:09,300
In that case,

243
00:16:10,220 --> 00:16:12,100
we'll continue to search for the Book of Yueque tomorrow.

244
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:25,860
I want ten more.

245
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,340
This is...

246
00:16:50,780 --> 00:16:51,420
Xue.

247
00:16:52,020 --> 00:16:53,050
Something is wrong here.

248
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:54,220
Don't touch it.

249
00:17:07,859 --> 00:17:08,900
How dare you trespass on

250
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:10,220
such important land in the Serene Valley?

251
00:17:12,660 --> 00:17:14,380
We need to see the Lord.

252
00:17:15,140 --> 00:17:16,300
If you want to see her,

253
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,380
you have to win this game.

254
00:17:19,530 --> 00:17:20,700
What?

255
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,180
I can just beat you up.

256
00:17:22,339 --> 00:17:22,780
Wait.

257
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:24,740
Judging from all the signs when we entered the Valley,

258
00:17:25,210 --> 00:17:27,060
the Lord behaves strangely.

259
00:17:27,339 --> 00:17:29,460
Maybe, only by following her requirements

260
00:17:29,740 --> 00:17:30,860
can we pass smoothly.

261
00:17:32,100 --> 00:17:32,900
Fine.

262
00:17:33,780 --> 00:17:35,340
I'll get some exercise.

263
00:17:35,340 --> 00:17:36,140
Wait.

264
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:39,700
They're the two chosen candidates.

265
00:17:43,540 --> 00:17:46,260
You need to tie your hands together

266
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,060
and can only move things with your faces.

267
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:50,700
After you reach the destination through the wooden bridge,

268
00:17:50,740 --> 00:17:51,980
we'll have a quiz.

269
00:17:52,330 --> 00:17:53,780
Finish it within the specified time.

270
00:17:53,860 --> 00:17:55,020
Even if we succeed,

271
00:17:55,220 --> 00:17:56,900
how stupid does someone have to be

272
00:17:56,900 --> 00:17:59,180
to force us to play such a ridiculous game?

273
00:18:09,070 --> 00:18:10,460
[The master of Shu. The invincible young master]

274
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:15,660
Did I

275
00:18:16,220 --> 00:18:18,740
force Li Chengxi to do such things before?

276
00:18:25,140 --> 00:18:27,300
Don't look at me.

277
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:28,860
Listen to her carefully.

278
00:18:49,820 --> 00:18:51,700
You chose the silk handkerchief.

279
00:18:51,900 --> 00:18:54,420
You're obviously cheating.

280
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:56,420
Get out of the Serene Valley if you don't accept this.

281
00:18:56,540 --> 00:18:56,940
I...

282
00:18:58,740 --> 00:18:59,860
The game starts now.

283
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:21,790
♫The story unlocks a new chapter♫

284
00:19:21,790 --> 00:19:24,360

Start.

303
00:20:10,740 --> 00:20:12,380
One question per person. You can't answer each other's question.

304
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:14,380
If you can't finish within the assigned time,

305
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:15,740
you will be punished.

306
00:20:16,580 --> 00:20:17,500
This question is for the girl.

307
00:20:17,740 --> 00:20:19,980
How many eyelashes are there in the boy's left eye?

308
00:20:21,500 --> 00:20:23,020
Who can answer that?

309
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,290
That's so brave and sweet.

310
00:20:32,500 --> 00:20:35,500
My heart is pounding.

311
00:20:37,330 --> 00:20:38,420
It's you, the Lord.

312
00:20:43,450 --> 00:20:45,130
It's me.

313
00:20:45,300 --> 00:20:46,460
You sweet young thing.

314
00:20:46,700 --> 00:20:48,100
If it weren't for my plan,

315
00:20:48,380 --> 00:20:50,660
you two wouldn't have progressed so quickly.

316
00:20:51,140 --> 00:20:52,740
So you're the Lord.

317
00:20:53,300 --> 00:20:54,780
You sent so many puppets to beat us up

318
00:20:55,010 --> 00:20:56,500
and now you're playing with us while dressing as a puppet.

319
00:20:57,140 --> 00:20:58,460
Give me the Book of Yueque

320
00:20:58,500 --> 00:20:59,660
or I won't let you off.

321
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,540
How can you talk to your elders like that?

322
00:21:04,220 --> 00:21:05,980
Lord of the Valley, please don't be angry.

323
00:21:06,300 --> 00:21:07,740
We're here

324
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,380
to ask for the Book of Yueque.

325
00:21:10,540 --> 00:21:13,090
We've played so many of the games with you.

326
00:21:13,490 --> 00:21:16,450
Can you lend us the Book of Yueque?

327
00:21:18,100 --> 00:21:21,100
No, I haven't had enough fun yet.

328
00:21:21,660 --> 00:21:24,650
Unless you play another game with me,

329
00:21:25,050 --> 00:21:25,780
there's no need

330
00:21:26,500 --> 00:21:27,570
to talk about any book.

331
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:34,860
OK.

332
00:21:43,380 --> 00:21:43,940
Come on.

333
00:21:44,220 --> 00:21:45,020
You two, sit here.

334
00:21:45,580 --> 00:21:46,220
You two, sit here.

335
00:21:50,820 --> 00:21:51,540
Look.

336
00:21:52,660 --> 00:21:54,260
This game is called

337
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:58,340
Walking into Your Heart.

338
00:22:37,180 --> 00:22:37,860

Where are we?

Brother.

Where are you?

00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:54,460
Brother!

Brother!

344
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,140
Where are you?

345
00:23:16,220 --> 00:23:17,060
Hey, little boy.

346
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:19,620
Are you okay?

347
00:23:25,090 --> 00:23:26,300
There's some noise over there. Let's go and take a look.

348
00:23:50,260 --> 00:23:51,180
Boy,

349
00:23:53,260 --> 00:23:54,380
are you okay?

350
00:24:12,220 --> 00:24:13,100
Gentlemen,

351
00:24:13,580 --> 00:24:14,290
what are your names?

352
00:24:14,780 --> 00:24:16,500
We met

353
00:24:16,810 --> 00:24:17,780
in the wilderness.

354
00:24:18,180 --> 00:24:19,300
It's fate.

355
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:23,130
Have you ever been struck by lightning?

Since you're using it to remove your demonic energy,

358
00:24:25,180 --> 00:24:26,100
not to harm people....

359
00:24:26,340 --> 00:24:27,620
I said we're buddies.

360
00:24:28,020 --> 00:24:28,810
Here you go.

361
00:24:29,700 --> 00:24:31,780
Got it. It has to be symmetrical, right?

362

♫Is it right or wrong to let go♫

00:24:41,700 --> 00:24:42,580
I think

368
00:24:43,340 --> 00:24:45,140
I've fallen for you.

♫We can't escape the torture♫

372

fallen in love with you.

Yan.

374
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:55,100

♫Your figure is very thin♫

What's wrong?

378
00:24:59,940 --> 00:25:05,350
♫Choking up, I look even weaker♫

Li Chengxi.

00:25:02,220 --> 00:25:04,140
Li Chengxi, I remember now.

381
00:25:04,300 --> 00:25:05,740
I remember everything.

382

♫It won't help♫

383
00:25:06,820 --> 00:25:09,060
Really? You regained your memory?

00:25:08,620 --> 00:25:14,830
♫No matter how much I say♫

385
00:25:09,940 --> 00:25:11,050
I got all my memories back.

386
00:25:12,090 --> 00:25:13,770
And do you remember

387
00:25:14,060 --> 00:25:15,540
the little girl who was struck by lightning

388
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:17,540
who you met when you were young?

389
00:25:17,390 --> 00:25:22,800
♫Thousand years of reincarnation is too confusing♫

390

That's me, too.

00:25:19,540 --> 00:25:21,660
But when I woke up,

392
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:23,300
I lost this memory.

393
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,870
♫I can't tell what character I'm playing♫

394

But

00:25:24,140 --> 00:25:25,300
I remembered everything

396
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:26,260
just now.

397
00:25:26,780 --> 00:25:28,220
We've known each other for a long time.

♫Closing my eyes♫

I know how I feel now.

♫The mockery of fate, how difficult it is♫

405
00:25:40,700 --> 00:25:42,100
I can make a decision now.

♫Yearning is easily broken♫

Great.

You old hag.

430
00:27:24,460 --> 00:27:25,660
What spell did you cast on him?

431
00:27:25,780 --> 00:27:27,050
Why hasn't he woken up after so long?

432
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:29,860
Don't be ungrateful.

433
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:33,260
I carefully prepared this incense

434
00:27:33,700 --> 00:27:35,420
for them to have sweet dreams.

435
00:27:36,340 --> 00:27:37,260
I'm afraid the two of them

436
00:27:37,460 --> 00:27:39,690
won't want to wake up for the rest of their lives.

437
00:27:39,690 --> 00:27:40,340
What?

438
00:27:41,500 --> 00:27:42,780
He'll never wake up?

439
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:44,140
I knew you didn't have good intentions.

440
00:27:44,820 --> 00:27:46,340
Brother, wake up.

441
00:27:47,140 --> 00:27:48,140
Wake up, brother!

442

Xue.

443

Don't waste your energy.

444
00:27:53,500 --> 00:27:54,610
If my guess is right,

445
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,340
unless the Lord disperses the incense herself

446
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:00,340
or the dreamers

447
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,860
have a strong will to escape,

448
00:28:04,300 --> 00:28:06,620
it's hard to wake them up by force.

449
00:28:06,740 --> 00:28:08,660
Old hag, wake them up

450
00:28:08,900 --> 00:28:10,540
or I'll let make you lie down for the rest of your life too.

451
00:28:12,300 --> 00:28:13,660
Don't even think of breaking them up.

00:28:30,420 --> 00:28:32,340
Oh, no! The Nightmarish Incense!
