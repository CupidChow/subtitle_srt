1
00:01:48,024 --> 00:01:51,402
Then, I took it out.

2
00:01:54,322 --> 00:01:55,448
Its size was

3
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:58,785
about this big.

4
00:01:59,661 --> 00:02:02,831
It was nice yellow with many holes.

5
00:02:03,581 --> 00:02:05,375
It looked so good.

6
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:08,211
I carried it around in my arms.

7
00:02:10,505 --> 00:02:14,759
Then I saw a girl sitting on the street
with her younger sibling on her back.

8
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:18,054
I could tell they were starved.

9
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:21,141
Their faces were yellow,

10
00:02:21,891 --> 00:02:23,643
and the younger one's body was limp

11
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,311
with no energy to cry.

12
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:31,359
So I turned away to eat it.

13
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,613
But I ended up giving it to them.

14
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:40,910
Since I had it in my arms all day,

15
00:02:41,578 --> 00:02:44,539
it must have been warm.

16
00:02:47,167 --> 00:02:48,251
That nice castella.

17
00:02:49,085 --> 00:02:50,795
It'd be the last one

18
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:53,089
I could ever have in my life.

19
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,053
They were devouring it.

20
00:03:00,054 --> 00:03:02,348
She was shoving it
in the younger one's mouth.

21
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,312
Would God remember that?

22
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,105
It was 30 years ago.

23
00:03:12,108 --> 00:03:13,151
For sure.

24
00:03:14,027 --> 00:03:15,528
That's His specialty.

25
00:03:16,863 --> 00:03:17,989
Right.

26
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:22,410
Remember you played the pipe for me?

27
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:27,123
Can you play that one more time?

28
00:03:50,146 --> 00:03:51,898
You know how to do cardiac massage?

29
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,319
Do it.

30
00:03:58,863 --> 00:03:59,781
Stop.

31
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:04,160
Again.

32
00:04:16,422 --> 00:04:17,382
Two hundred joules.

33
00:04:29,894 --> 00:04:30,728
Charge.

34
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:37,360
The ones who want to connect
with God tend to have self-hatred

35
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,280
and unknowingly seek for misfortune.

36
00:04:40,363 --> 00:04:42,615
They're quite vulnerable to demons.

37
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:45,910
Just like Saint Bruno said,
suicide is to die a martyr for Satan.

38
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,747
It's the worst sin among murders.

39
00:04:50,665 --> 00:04:52,792
It's like a life sentence in hell.

40
00:04:55,670 --> 00:04:57,880
Say 20 Hail Marys, get plenty of sunlight,

41
00:04:57,964 --> 00:04:59,716
and take a cold shower.

42
00:04:59,799 --> 00:05:02,385
Take God's gift of science.

43
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:06,097
Talk to a psychiatrist
and take antidepressants.

44
00:05:08,433 --> 00:05:10,810
Please stop thinking of suicide.

45
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:14,063
And forget about him, he's gone. Please.

46
00:05:21,446 --> 00:05:22,322
Father.

47
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:26,784
I'll take care of my relationships
and other businesses.

48
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,330
You just sit there and pray for me.

49
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:35,335
Could you ask the bishop
to send me to Emmanuel labs, please?

50
00:05:38,212 --> 00:05:41,758
I heard it's not approved by the Vatican.

51
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:45,428
Sarah died on Monday.

52
00:05:45,511 --> 00:05:47,388
She had surgery eight times.

53
00:05:48,056 --> 00:05:50,266
Hyo-seong's been
in a coma since yesterday.

54
00:05:52,018 --> 00:05:55,229
It's painful to see people die like this.

55
00:05:55,897 --> 00:06:00,777
No one knows
what's going on in that laboratory.

56
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:05,114
I want to save people.

57
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,699
My gosh.

58
00:06:07,658 --> 00:06:10,578
I told you to go to medical school
since you were young.

59
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,332
It would've been great to check my eyes
if you became an ophthalmologist.

60
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,500
Father.

61
00:06:15,583 --> 00:06:17,835
-Can I go to Emmanuel Lab--
-Hey.

62
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:20,046
Let's stop chatting
and give the formula of absolution.

63
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,260
I told you to do your confessions.

64
00:06:29,847 --> 00:06:33,142
Hello, I'm sorry to leave all of you
without a proper goodbye.

65
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,105
It was such a last minute vacation.

66
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:41,359
I packed everything I could,

67
00:06:42,276 --> 00:06:44,070
but everyone says I won't need a thing.

68
00:06:44,153 --> 00:06:46,406
Because the hotel
provided by the church is so nice.

69
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:50,618
I'm happy
I became a priest in times like this.

70
00:09:04,001 --> 00:09:07,755
In your name, I pray that Jesus Christ
will allow me the following.

71
00:09:09,131 --> 00:09:12,385
Like a leper rotting in the flesh,
let all avoid me.

72
00:09:13,636 --> 00:09:17,723
Like a cripple with no limbs,
let me not move freely.

73
00:09:19,976 --> 00:09:23,312
Remove my cheeks
that tears may not roll down them.

74
00:09:24,355 --> 00:09:28,693
Crush my lips and tongue
so that these don't commit sin.

75
00:09:28,776 --> 00:09:32,321
Pull out all of my nails so that I may be
unable to grab even the tinniest things.

76
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:36,033
Let my shoulders and back be crooked
so that I cannot lift anything.

77
00:09:38,494 --> 00:09:42,248
Do not let me think straight
as if I'm a patient with brain tumor.

78
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:46,002
Put my body part
that has been kept pure to shame

79
00:09:46,085 --> 00:09:47,837
so that it would not be proud.

80
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:49,839
Let me stay in humiliation.

81
00:09:51,173 --> 00:09:53,301
Don't let anyone pray for me.

82
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:57,597
May only Jesus Christ's mercy
have pity on me.

83
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,316
It has already been a month.

84
00:10:09,191 --> 00:10:11,319
The scenary out the window
is so phenominal

85
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,821
and it let me forget about TV.

86
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,910
The hotel owner gave me a room
with a view and told me I was handsome.

87
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:24,749
Thanks to her, my skin got so tan
and it's even peeling...

88
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:58,801
Time of death, 3:31 p.m.

89
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:15,484
In your name, I pray that Jesus Christ
will allow me the following.

90
00:12:17,027 --> 00:12:20,281
Like a leper rotting in the flesh,
let all avoid me.

91
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,867
Like a cripple with no limbs...

92
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,910
Look, look at his skin.

93
00:12:44,388 --> 00:12:46,432
Father, please hold my hand.

94
00:12:46,515 --> 00:12:48,350
Please pray for me.

95
00:12:50,478 --> 00:12:54,732
Father,
my five-year-old girl has leukemia.

96
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:59,278
PLEASE PRAY FOR US

97
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,126
You're saying people come to us

98
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:20,257
to beg for a prayer
from the bandaged man.

99
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:23,093
What a rumor.

100
00:13:28,891 --> 00:13:31,268
I heard there were some who got healed.

101
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,815
It could be psychologica.

102
00:13:37,107 --> 00:13:40,736
Since you're the only one
survived out of 50 applicants.

103
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,490
Isn't that so?

104
00:13:49,912 --> 00:13:52,081
-You're lucky!
-You're lucky!

105
00:13:52,164 --> 00:13:53,874
I envy you.

106
00:13:53,958 --> 00:13:55,209
Look at him.

107
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:10,808
Are you the only survivor out of 500?

108
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:15,020
My kid has cancer!

109
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:18,232
Would you pray for him?

110
00:14:20,609 --> 00:14:22,611
It's just a psychological effect.

111
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,738
I can't do anything.

112
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,286
Channel nine isn't working.

113
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,579
Let's pray, son.

114
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:35,875
What?

115
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,669
By any chance,

116
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:41,505
didn't you live in Busan?

117
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:48,596
We're gathered here
praying for Gang-u Lee.

118
00:14:50,472 --> 00:14:52,641
He was born out of Your love.

119
00:14:53,934 --> 00:14:56,854
He has a soft-heart
where he can't even pass by

120
00:14:58,397 --> 00:15:00,566
a wounded animal on the street.

121
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,652
Please have mercy on him.

122
00:15:04,862 --> 00:15:07,865
I pray in Jesus' name.

123
00:15:07,948 --> 00:15:08,866
-Amen.
-Amen.

124
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,536
Come on.

125
00:15:13,621 --> 00:15:15,164
I don't believe in this stuff

126
00:15:15,915 --> 00:15:18,083
but since you're my friend,
I let you do it.

127
00:15:23,047 --> 00:15:25,007
Hey, now I think I recognize you.

128
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:27,259
I'm sorry, you're still a priest.

129
00:15:30,137 --> 00:15:31,764
I'm sorry, Father.

130
00:15:35,142 --> 00:15:38,354
You used to come over for noodles.

131
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,688
Fifth grade, right?

132
00:15:40,439 --> 00:15:42,524
You lived at the church orphanage, right?

133
00:15:43,943 --> 00:15:45,778
My son was so kind-hearted

134
00:15:45,861 --> 00:15:48,280
that he was so good to the orphans too.

135
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:49,865
Wasn't he?

136
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:53,077
Your sister was so shy
and ran out whenever I came over.

137
00:15:54,828 --> 00:15:56,705
She had calluses on her feet

138
00:15:56,789 --> 00:15:59,541
and Gang-u made me touch them.

139
00:16:04,171 --> 00:16:07,383
Her parents rented
a small room in our house.

140
00:16:09,343 --> 00:16:12,596
Her father was a high school drop out.

141
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:17,977
This is my blood shed for you
so that sins may be forgiven.

142
00:16:18,477 --> 00:16:20,187
One snowy spring day,

143
00:16:20,688 --> 00:16:23,524
they left her in my room
and said they'd be back soon.

144
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:25,859
But they never came back.

145
00:16:26,360 --> 00:16:27,236
HAPPY CLASSIC BOUTIQUE

146
00:16:27,319 --> 00:16:29,446
So I took the three-year-old in

147
00:16:30,030 --> 00:16:32,866
and raised her
like a daughter and a puppy.

148
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:35,285
She'd call me "Mommy" too.

149
00:16:35,369 --> 00:16:36,245
HAPPY HANBOK

150
00:16:36,328 --> 00:16:37,913
I'm her mommy-in-law now.

151
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:43,669
Marriage is no big deal.

152
00:16:44,461 --> 00:16:47,965
She just moved
from sleeping in my bed to Gang-u's.

153
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:55,806
Why'd you buy the laver
at that place again, Mom?

154
00:16:57,349 --> 00:17:00,394
I told you it's no good

155
00:17:00,477 --> 00:17:04,648
and the owner is a cocksucker.

156
00:17:36,180 --> 00:17:37,306
You hate it that much?

157
00:17:38,348 --> 00:17:39,433
No, it's not that.

158
00:17:40,059 --> 00:17:41,769
I'm sensitive to smell these days.

159
00:17:42,728 --> 00:17:45,105
I suddenly got a whiff of blood.

160
00:17:49,985 --> 00:17:51,028
Gang-u's home.

161
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:54,531
-Mom, I think I caught a cold.
-What?

162
00:17:54,615 --> 00:17:55,991
Sang-hyeon, you came early.

163
00:17:56,075 --> 00:17:58,118
I told you to wear your long johns.

164
00:17:58,202 --> 00:18:00,621
-We're here, too.
-Welcome.

165
00:18:00,704 --> 00:18:01,872
How are you?

166
00:18:01,955 --> 00:18:03,457
My friend the priest.

167
00:18:03,540 --> 00:18:06,335
This is our dam construction manager
and his wife.

168
00:18:06,418 --> 00:18:10,047
It's an honor, Father. I'm Yeong-du.

169
00:18:10,130 --> 00:18:12,466
She's a Filipina, so she's Catholic.

170
00:18:12,966 --> 00:18:14,635
Say hello, Evelyn.

171
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:24,853
Tae-ju!

172
00:18:26,063 --> 00:18:27,189
How have you been?

173
00:18:33,362 --> 00:18:36,532
Here comes the police chief.

174
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,451
Please, stop calling me that.

175
00:18:39,535 --> 00:18:41,703
I quit the force a long time ago.

176
00:18:43,413 --> 00:18:45,833
He's the security head.
This is Father Hyeon.

177
00:18:45,916 --> 00:18:48,585
-Hello.
-Do you like fishing?

178
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:53,298
Get on his good side
and you can fish there though its banned.

179
00:18:53,382 --> 00:18:55,926
Daytimes are a bit tricky.
Come by at nights.

180
00:18:56,009 --> 00:18:58,137
Have a seat, Father.

181
00:18:58,220 --> 00:18:59,263
Yes, please.

182
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:08,063
Koreans don't appreciate mahjong.

183
00:19:10,190 --> 00:19:12,985
Would you like to play, Father?

184
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:14,736
I don't know how to play.

185
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:22,077
Did I tell you
about Father Hyeon praying for Gang-u?

186
00:19:24,204 --> 00:19:28,041
I was standing right next to my son.

187
00:19:28,125 --> 00:19:33,213
Suddenly, I felt something hot
come down on my head.

188
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:35,048
I felt tingly all over

189
00:19:35,132 --> 00:19:38,760
like someone was poking me with needles.

190
00:19:38,844 --> 00:19:40,095
Oh my.

191
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:44,308
Then my boy said

192
00:19:44,892 --> 00:19:47,352
"Mom, it feels hot right here."

193
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:53,483
Then the cancer vanished.

194
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:54,902
It vanished?

195
00:19:57,613 --> 00:20:00,282
You always feel tingly
because of your blood pressure.

196
00:20:00,365 --> 00:20:02,826
But I did a biopsy just in case.

197
00:20:02,910 --> 00:20:03,744
What?

198
00:20:05,412 --> 00:20:06,872
Your first endoscope showed

199
00:20:06,955 --> 00:20:09,666
it was esophagus cancer.

200
00:20:10,667 --> 00:20:13,712
Women shouldn't get sedated endoscopes.

201
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:17,883
Doctors secretly molest them.

202
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,933
I win.

203
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,103
Three closed triplets.

204
00:20:30,687 --> 00:20:32,064
That's eight points.

205
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:37,069
Mrs. Ra.

206
00:20:37,861 --> 00:20:39,988
Can we turn the heater down?

207
00:20:40,822 --> 00:20:42,032
But I'm cold.

208
00:20:42,950 --> 00:20:44,284
Thank you.

209
00:20:44,368 --> 00:20:45,869
Gang-u says he's cold!

210
00:20:45,953 --> 00:20:47,079
I'm losing so much.

211
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:49,957
Thank you very much.

212
00:20:51,166 --> 00:20:52,042
Okay.

213
00:21:16,650 --> 00:21:18,610
What's with me today?

214
00:21:19,695 --> 00:21:21,655
Instead of the hot water bag.

215
00:21:54,980 --> 00:21:57,065
I'm going down
to get the lights in the store.

216
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:59,693
Okay, let's do it.

00:23:09,388 --> 00:23:11,014
Don't you love our mahjong gang?

219

Wednesdays. Mercury. Water.

220
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,857
Oasis. How's that for our gang's name?

221
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,351
My God.

222
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:10,073
Pull out all of my nails...

HAPPY CLASSIC BOUTIQUE

224
00:26:27,043 --> 00:26:29,087
She's Veronica, a Catholic.

225
00:26:30,547 --> 00:26:32,424
She was in a bad hit-and-run.

226
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:36,177
Lost a lot of blood.

227
00:26:36,886 --> 00:26:38,597
She's still conscious though.

228
00:26:43,977 --> 00:26:46,104
Let this water call
to mind your baptismal sharing.

229
00:26:46,187 --> 00:26:50,191
In Christ's redeeming passion
and resurrection.

230
00:26:51,735 --> 00:26:52,902
Veronica.

231
00:26:53,862 --> 00:26:54,946
Make your confession.

232
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,082
I confess...

233
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:19,471
By the power
the apostolic see has given me

234
00:27:19,554 --> 00:27:21,806
in the name of the Father,
the son, and the holy spirit,

235
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:24,768
I grant you a plenary indulgence and...

236
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:33,276
pardon for all your sins. Amen.

237
00:27:37,113 --> 00:27:39,783
Through this holy anointing,

238
00:27:42,285 --> 00:27:44,412
may the lord in his love
and mercy help you

239
00:27:46,956 --> 00:27:49,918
with the grace of the holy spirit.

240
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:53,755
And

241
00:27:54,839 --> 00:27:57,092
may the Lord free you from sin,

242
00:27:58,051 --> 00:27:59,803
save you,

243
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,138
and lighten your suffering with mercy.

244
00:28:04,683 --> 00:28:05,517
Amen.

245
00:31:41,024 --> 00:31:42,942
Where did you wander off to this time?

246
00:31:45,278 --> 00:31:47,697
I woke up and I was at the pharmacy.

247
00:31:48,197 --> 00:31:50,199
And some man walked past.

248
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:53,244
Aren't there pills for sleepwalking?

249
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:57,040
I should lock your room from the outside.

250
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:59,292
Should've got me pills for my cold.

251
00:32:01,127 --> 00:32:01,961
Wasn't it cold?

252
00:32:02,879 --> 00:32:04,339
You never even catch a cold.

253
00:32:08,009 --> 00:32:09,385
She's a yeti, Mom.

254
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,147
Smells like when you had gastritis.

255
00:32:21,731 --> 00:32:23,524
I'll go find the pills.

256
00:32:26,569 --> 00:32:28,488
Must you do this to believe me?

257
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:35,411
Don't grab my heart so hard.

258
00:32:52,428 --> 00:32:54,806
I drank Hyo-seong's blood

259
00:32:55,306 --> 00:32:56,933
and the blisters disappeared.

260
00:32:57,892 --> 00:33:00,269
It's as if the vampire cells
suppressed the disease.

261
00:33:02,230 --> 00:33:03,940
But it doesn't last very long.

262
00:33:06,442 --> 00:33:07,276
Father.

263
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,905
I didn't choose the blood
that was transfused into me.

264
00:33:12,365 --> 00:33:14,492
You know I went there to do good.

265
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:23,042
Now, I thirst after all sinful pleasures.

266
00:33:24,127 --> 00:33:27,755
But how can I get
human blood without killing?

267
00:33:28,589 --> 00:33:29,507
First,

268
00:33:30,508 --> 00:33:33,219
the lord said
not to worry about what to eat.

269
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:35,805
For he feeds even the birds in the sky.

270
00:33:36,723 --> 00:33:37,557
Here.

271
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,411
I think I won.

272
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,246
My goodness.

273
00:34:00,913 --> 00:34:01,789
Small four winds.

274
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:04,709
Closed, half flush, bonus three points.

275
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,004
28,000 won. You lose!

276
00:34:11,299 --> 00:34:14,719
Is he from Macao or something?

277
00:34:15,261 --> 00:34:20,683
He's the only one
who survived out of 500.

278
00:34:20,767 --> 00:34:22,310
Five hundred, my ass.

HAPPY CLASSIC BOUTIQUE

280
00:34:59,764 --> 00:35:01,099
When did you go out?

281
00:35:01,974 --> 00:35:03,851
I didn't see you pass by.

282
00:35:53,151 --> 00:35:56,737
It's a kind of an infectious disease.

283
00:35:58,573 --> 00:35:59,490
Scary, isn't it?

284
00:36:00,074 --> 00:36:03,411
You look so different
without your glasses.

285
00:36:06,122 --> 00:36:07,498
How can you get infected?

286
00:36:10,209 --> 00:36:12,503
Not through a kiss for sure.

287
00:36:13,379 --> 00:36:15,840
I never kissed anyone in my life.

288
00:36:20,678 --> 00:36:21,554
Until now.

289
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:52,877
I don't get shy.

290
00:36:55,213 --> 00:36:57,131
I didn't run out because I was shy.

291
00:36:58,549 --> 00:37:01,135
When I was young, back in Busan,

292
00:37:02,678 --> 00:37:04,722
it was because I was sick of everything.

293
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:11,979
The mom, idiot son,

294
00:37:12,521 --> 00:37:14,523
and the dark, damp house.

295
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,860
The nonstop weepy, old songs.

296
00:37:25,076 --> 00:37:27,036
I waited for you to come.

297
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,248
You were just an orphanage boy,

298
00:37:32,375 --> 00:37:34,210
I would look out the window

299
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:36,629
when I was young.

300
00:37:38,881 --> 00:37:41,008
Because the idiot liked you.

301
00:37:42,009 --> 00:37:44,095
When you came, he left me alone.

302
00:37:52,061 --> 00:37:54,272
I'm not a shy person.

303
00:38:08,202 --> 00:38:10,288
I run out on my bare feet

304
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,125
to escape from this hell sooner.

305
00:38:23,551 --> 00:38:25,678
I even run out from my sleep.

306
00:38:26,178 --> 00:38:28,014
They think I'm sleepwalking.

307
00:38:28,681 --> 00:38:30,558
I feel awake only then

308
00:38:30,641 --> 00:38:32,643
and asleep the rest of the time.

309
00:39:56,060 --> 00:39:57,186
Honey!

310
00:39:58,729 --> 00:39:59,563
Tae-ju!

311
00:39:59,647 --> 00:40:01,148
Hot water bag!

312
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:03,359
Tae-ju?

313
00:40:05,486 --> 00:40:06,821
Tae-ju!

314
00:40:40,020 --> 00:40:41,313
You bitch!

315
00:40:41,897 --> 00:40:44,066
There she goes again.

316
00:40:44,150 --> 00:40:46,360
I fed you and raised you!

317
00:40:46,444 --> 00:40:48,821
-You know that?
-Go put her to bed!

318
00:40:49,780 --> 00:40:52,992
You can't even change
your husband's hot water bag?

319
00:40:53,075 --> 00:40:56,662
How dare you!

320
00:40:56,745 --> 00:40:57,955
-I win.
-What?

321
00:40:58,038 --> 00:40:59,707
-Let go!
-My gosh.

322
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,088
You have stomach troubles?

323
00:41:06,714 --> 00:41:08,132
What took you so long?

324
00:41:08,215 --> 00:41:10,885
Eat up other's money
and you'll get diarrhea.

325
00:41:20,895 --> 00:41:21,896
What's got into you?

326
00:41:23,647 --> 00:41:25,232
This looks fun.

327
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:28,235
So exciting to touch.

328
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,656
I could do it all night, too.

329
00:41:32,740 --> 00:41:34,492
You don't even know how to do it.

330
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:36,535
Me?

331
00:41:37,786 --> 00:41:39,163
I know how to do it.

332
00:41:40,539 --> 00:41:41,665
I'm good.

333
00:41:44,251 --> 00:41:47,046
They are on fire.

334
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,217
I can't wait till next Wednesday.

335
00:41:51,300 --> 00:41:53,344
Then how about Sundays, too?

336
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:56,138
Why not?

337
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,224
Well...

338
00:42:00,601 --> 00:42:03,145
It's Easter Sunday.
I'm staying at the hospital.

339
00:42:04,396 --> 00:42:07,024
It's best to leave things in wanting.

340
00:42:09,401 --> 00:42:11,320
-Mom.
-Yeah.

341
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:14,406
You know.

342
00:42:14,490 --> 00:42:15,324
Yeah?

343
00:42:16,534 --> 00:42:18,786
I don't want to live like this anymore.

344
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:21,789
I...

345
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:27,127
want to help the needy.

346
00:42:31,131 --> 00:42:34,593
Maybe I can volunteer
at a hospital or something.

347
00:42:38,013 --> 00:42:38,931
On Sundays.

348
00:43:26,687 --> 00:43:27,896
Thanks for coming.

349
00:43:29,523 --> 00:43:30,858
Don't ever come again.

350
00:43:32,318 --> 00:43:34,820
But I came to help the needy.

351
00:43:37,948 --> 00:43:41,327
Its a bigger sin for a priest.

352
00:43:42,286 --> 00:43:44,330
I'm not even Catholic.

353
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,459
To me, you're just a needy, single man.

354
00:43:49,460 --> 00:43:53,380
We can both go to hell for this.

355
00:43:54,048 --> 00:43:56,467
I don't have faith. I'm not going to hell.

356
00:44:01,930 --> 00:44:02,890
But...

357
00:44:06,101 --> 00:44:08,395
I have a terrible disease.

358
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:11,398
I'm too damn healthy.

359
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:14,985
Just once, I wish I could be sick in bed.

360
00:44:42,388 --> 00:44:43,347
It's okay.

361
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,892
Hyo-seong is a nice guy,

362
00:44:47,851 --> 00:44:48,936
but he's in a coma.

363
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:54,817
Unless his vitals drop,
no one will come in here at nights.

364
00:46:39,546 --> 00:46:42,090
Sorry, I hurt you.

365
00:46:45,761 --> 00:46:46,929
No,

366
00:46:48,013 --> 00:46:49,139
its good.

367
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:52,434
It's strange, but good.

368
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:57,940
Is it supposed to feel this good?

369
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:36,645
What's wrong with me?

370
00:47:39,606 --> 00:47:41,358
Are other women like this?

371
00:47:43,986 --> 00:47:45,320
Am I a pervert?

372
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,542
Did you eat?

373
00:51:28,460 --> 00:51:30,337
Oh, yes.

374
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:35,342
Can we meet during the day next week?

375
00:51:36,718 --> 00:51:38,178
Daytimes are a bit difficult.

376
00:51:39,763 --> 00:51:41,389
We could be together longer.

377
00:51:45,393 --> 00:51:48,313
I don't want to keep
my disease a secret from you.

378
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,441
I am...

379
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:57,531
a kind of a...

380
00:52:47,038 --> 00:52:49,499
I don't kill anyone, you know.

381
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,751
About Hyo-seong,

382
00:52:52,752 --> 00:52:55,297
he loved helping the hungry.

383
00:52:56,798 --> 00:52:59,843
He'd offer me his blood,
if he wasn't in a coma.

384
00:53:01,261 --> 00:53:04,347
If you only heard the sponge cake story.

385
00:53:06,725 --> 00:53:09,394
No one blames someone
for getting hurt in an accident.

386
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:12,480
No one gets criticized for having cancer.

387
00:53:16,318 --> 00:53:18,486
I went there to do good!

388
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:29,331
So what if I'm a vampire?

389
00:53:31,458 --> 00:53:34,419
Tae-ju, did you like me
because I'm a priest?

390
00:53:35,503 --> 00:53:38,548
Its not that, is it? That's just my job.

391
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:42,260
Being a vampire
is like having different palates

392
00:53:43,303 --> 00:53:45,805
or different life patterns.

393
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:46,848
Don't you think?

394
00:53:47,766 --> 00:53:50,602
When two people are in love,
does it really matter?

395
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:53,647
No, what I mean is...

396
00:53:55,774 --> 00:53:57,234
You hate that I'm a vampire?

397
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,737
Think I could've slept
with you if I wasn't?

398
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,281
How could I have sex with you?

399
00:54:03,990 --> 00:54:05,533
As just a priest?

400
00:54:08,995 --> 00:54:10,330
Come with me.

401
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:12,249
I'll take you away from this hell.

402
00:54:16,211 --> 00:54:19,047
You liked doing it with me.
Gang-u's no fun.

403
00:54:25,679 --> 00:54:26,596
Tae-ju?

404
00:54:35,063 --> 00:54:36,106
What's going on?

405
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,403
The toilet's not flushing.

406
00:54:54,457 --> 00:54:55,834
It's going down now.

407
00:55:14,352 --> 00:55:15,228
Closing time.

408
00:56:06,029 --> 00:56:06,863
Hello?

409
00:56:07,364 --> 00:56:08,823
How can

410
00:56:10,116 --> 00:56:11,993
someone become a vampire?

411
00:56:14,913 --> 00:56:17,165
Can you catch it through sex?

412
00:56:22,962 --> 00:56:25,131
Can you turn me into one?

413
00:57:07,424 --> 00:57:08,800
Vampires are

414
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,095
cuter than I thought.

415
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:20,979
Can you bend this?

416
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:23,565
What for?

417
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:45,253
Can you jump down from here?

418
00:57:57,056 --> 00:57:58,683
Is it too high?

419
00:58:37,013 --> 00:58:38,264
I'm ready.

420
00:59:25,645 --> 00:59:26,854
Did Gang-u do that?

421
00:59:29,315 --> 00:59:30,483
Does he hurt you often?

422
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,030
Not often.

423
00:59:37,615 --> 00:59:41,869
Want me to rip him up like that coin?

424
00:59:54,007 --> 00:59:55,174
I lived

425
00:59:56,301 --> 00:59:59,220
as their dog my whole life.

426
01:00:00,805 --> 01:00:03,725
Feeding the idiot, washing him,

427
01:00:04,225 --> 01:00:06,352
and even helping him masturbate.

428
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,397
You know.

429
01:00:10,982 --> 01:00:13,151
I'm practically a virgin.

430
01:00:15,194 --> 01:00:16,029
He's...

431
01:00:17,572 --> 01:00:18,406
Does it hurt?

432
01:00:19,198 --> 01:00:20,074
It hurts, right?

433
01:00:30,293 --> 01:00:33,796
Can't you volunteer somewhere else?

434
01:00:34,964 --> 01:00:36,799
Mental hospitals are so scary.

435
01:00:37,800 --> 01:00:38,676
Isn't it?

436
01:00:45,808 --> 01:00:46,643
Drink it.

437
01:00:53,441 --> 01:00:55,777
Can't you go back to the lab

438
01:00:56,861 --> 01:00:58,321
to find out the cause?

439
01:00:59,572 --> 01:01:01,282
Ask if there's any way for a cure?

440
01:01:02,659 --> 01:01:05,870
Sunlight is bound
to hit me on my way there.

441
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,373
Sunlight.

442
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:15,213
I wish I can see the sunrise
over the sea before I die.

443
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:19,842
What are you thinking?

444
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:23,596
Vampires can't see the sunlight.

445
01:01:24,597 --> 01:01:26,808
I don't care if it's at night.

446
01:01:27,975 --> 01:01:30,061
The moon, the stars,

447
01:01:30,978 --> 01:01:33,314
and even a firefly.

448
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,401
I don't care you're a vampire.

449
01:01:36,901 --> 01:01:39,320
Make the blind see.

450
01:01:41,948 --> 01:01:43,700
Please give me some of your blood.

451
01:01:44,200 --> 01:01:46,703
It even killed the disease, EV!

452
01:01:47,412 --> 01:01:49,831
Please, Sang-hyeon.

453
01:01:49,914 --> 01:01:51,249
I said I'm okay with it.

454
01:01:52,291 --> 01:01:53,501
Sang-hyeon.

455
01:01:54,335 --> 01:01:55,503
Father Hyeon.

456
01:01:56,546 --> 01:01:58,464
It's really fine.

457
01:01:59,340 --> 01:02:01,551
Just a little bit, please?

458
01:02:04,137 --> 01:02:06,848
I'm no longer a priest nor a friar.

459
01:02:09,183 --> 01:02:11,894
Forget the rules. Forget the Vatican.

460
01:02:13,020 --> 01:02:14,480
It's none of my business now.

461
01:02:24,157 --> 01:02:27,493
I don't know why you wandered astray.

462
01:02:28,995 --> 01:02:32,749
But I know you'll get through this.

463
01:02:34,375 --> 01:02:38,838
I took pity on you when you were young.

464
01:02:40,423 --> 01:02:43,468
We had you over for noodles.

465
01:02:45,219 --> 01:02:48,222
You can stay here as long as you want.

466
01:02:48,306 --> 01:02:49,515
You understand?

467
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:51,476
Thank you.

468
01:02:55,772 --> 01:02:57,356
Tae-ju...

469
01:02:59,442 --> 01:03:01,110
She could act cold,

470
01:03:02,445 --> 01:03:04,697
but she's really warm-hearted.

471
01:03:06,282 --> 01:03:07,492
I'm giving the shop

472
01:03:08,367 --> 01:03:12,497
and everything to her.

473
01:03:15,875 --> 01:03:17,919
Did I do it too hard?

474
01:03:23,382 --> 01:03:24,592
It's perfect.

475
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:30,890
One more time, then?

476
01:03:59,168 --> 01:04:00,795
Good night.

477
01:04:00,878 --> 01:04:02,338
Sweet dreams.

478
01:05:21,208 --> 01:05:22,293
Hurry and get out.

479
01:05:25,004 --> 01:05:26,088
Hurry.

480
01:05:27,715 --> 01:05:28,674
Go.

481
01:05:30,301 --> 01:05:31,510
Someone will see you.

482
01:05:40,269 --> 01:05:41,270
No. Don't.

483
01:06:27,650 --> 01:06:29,193
Remember Tae-ju when she was young?

484
01:06:30,945 --> 01:06:32,321
Wasn't she cute?

485
01:06:33,531 --> 01:06:35,741
When she was twelve,

486
01:06:35,825 --> 01:06:38,536
she woke me up and showed me her panties.

487
01:06:39,537 --> 01:06:40,746
Said she peed blood.

488
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:46,252
She said she'd die
because she took too many weird pills.

489
01:06:47,962 --> 01:06:50,172
We hugged each other and cried all night.

490
01:06:53,759 --> 01:06:54,969
What are we waiting for?

491
01:06:56,303 --> 01:06:58,639
-Planning on taking all night?
-What?

492
01:07:01,517 --> 01:07:02,518
It's only 9:00 p.m.

493
01:07:03,352 --> 01:07:07,606
The hospital
and police questioning will take hours.

494
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,068
What if the sun comes up?

495
01:07:25,666 --> 01:07:27,293
I said, no!

496
01:07:28,502 --> 01:07:30,004
Just a little bit?

497
01:07:31,922 --> 01:07:34,216
They'll find out with an autopsy.

498
01:07:35,760 --> 01:07:38,054
I thought about it a lot.

499
01:07:38,596 --> 01:07:40,264
Why go somewhere else for blood?

500
01:07:40,931 --> 01:07:42,850
We have blood right here.

501
01:07:45,102 --> 01:07:46,353
Put the knife down.

502
01:07:47,646 --> 01:07:48,939
Yeah, put it down.

503
01:07:53,736 --> 01:07:55,696
No! Don't come near me!

504
01:08:45,329 --> 01:08:47,706
Tae-ju!

505
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:36,130
We have an injured,
unconscious female here.

506
01:09:36,213 --> 01:09:38,299
We'll be going soon. Please prepare.

507
01:09:38,382 --> 01:09:40,009
-Check it out quick!
-Yes, sir!

508
01:09:40,092 --> 01:09:41,719
How did that go?

509
01:09:42,386 --> 01:09:45,222
It's just not possible
because it's too dark right now.

510
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,193
Don't mention

511
01:09:57,276 --> 01:10:00,905
that I let you fish here.

512
01:10:02,156 --> 01:10:04,700
I'll take care of everything.

513
01:10:21,634 --> 01:10:23,886
Father Hyeon is here.

514
01:10:31,018 --> 01:10:33,979
He became ill again for our sins.

515
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:39,276
Grant me the following

516
01:10:39,818 --> 01:10:42,655
in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.

517
01:10:43,489 --> 01:10:47,993
Like a leper rotting in the flesh,
let all avoid me.

518
01:10:48,619 --> 01:10:51,205
Like a cripple with no limbs,

519
01:10:51,747 --> 01:10:54,583
let me not move freely.

520
01:10:55,251 --> 01:10:56,961
Remove my cheeks

521
01:10:57,044 --> 01:10:59,797
that tears may not roll down them.

522
01:11:02,466 --> 01:11:04,551
There was a house
at the bottom of the lake.

523
01:11:05,052 --> 01:11:06,595
A submerged village.

524
01:11:07,846 --> 01:11:10,516
I thought he was drown and dead.

525
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:15,229
But when I went up,
he'd float up again and again.

526
01:11:16,355 --> 01:11:18,107
So I put him in a closet in the house

527
01:11:18,190 --> 01:11:20,609
and a big rock on his chest.

528
01:11:22,945 --> 01:11:25,322
What if he comes out and chases me?

529
01:11:27,408 --> 01:11:30,869
I should've put a rock
at the closet door, too.

530
01:11:32,246 --> 01:11:34,248
Death is the end. Right, Father?

531
01:11:35,749 --> 01:11:36,875
You die and that's it?

532
01:11:51,557 --> 01:11:52,641
See?

533
01:11:54,727 --> 01:11:57,021
Vampires are not immortal.

534
01:11:59,231 --> 01:12:00,816
You still want my blood?

535
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:07,948
You want to see
this dark world that badly?

536
01:12:10,242 --> 01:12:12,453
You live on other's blood

537
01:12:13,287 --> 01:12:15,581
but won't give me a drop of yours.

538
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:23,922
Give me absolution
and I'll give it to you.

539
01:12:31,847 --> 01:12:34,058
Merciful Father,

540
01:12:35,059 --> 01:12:38,312
You saved the world through the death
and resurrection of the Son.

541
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:42,107
And sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins.

542
01:12:43,025 --> 01:12:46,820
Through the ministry of the Church,
may God give you pardon and peace.

543
01:12:47,571 --> 01:12:51,450
And I absolve you
from your sins in the name of the Father,

544
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:53,160
of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.

545
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:54,161
Amen.

546
01:12:55,245 --> 01:12:57,498
Let us praise the Lord.

547
01:13:02,169 --> 01:13:05,214
The Lord's mercy endures forever.

548
01:13:08,133 --> 01:13:12,054
The Lord has forgiven your sins.

549
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:44,730
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

550
01:14:45,981 --> 01:14:46,899
Amen.

551
01:14:50,694 --> 01:14:52,404
I pray to Tae-ju.

552
01:14:52,488 --> 01:14:53,489
Tae-ju,

553
01:14:54,406 --> 01:14:57,159
please wake up and listen to my prayer.

554
01:14:59,995 --> 01:15:02,372
I said Gang-u was drunk
from a bottle of soju,

555
01:15:02,456 --> 01:15:06,752
so say the same to the cops.

556
01:15:07,753 --> 01:15:10,672
When this is all over,
we will be together.

557
01:15:10,756 --> 01:15:13,425
We must not meet for a while.

558
01:15:15,844 --> 01:15:18,305
Though my face
may seem cold and rigid,

559
01:15:18,388 --> 01:15:22,059
my heart only beats for you.

560
01:15:23,685 --> 01:15:25,604
When we meet again,

561
01:15:26,605 --> 01:15:28,941
I believe we'll finally be happy.

562
01:15:31,443 --> 01:15:32,319
Father Hyeon.

563
01:15:33,237 --> 01:15:34,696
Doing it this way,

564
01:15:35,447 --> 01:15:39,535
I feel like I am not dying
but living inside you.

565
01:16:24,746 --> 01:16:26,915
-Stop all the...
-Thinking.

566
01:16:27,749 --> 01:16:33,714
The police needs
the body to close the case.

567
01:16:35,632 --> 01:16:36,883
Mrs. Ra.

568
01:16:36,967 --> 01:16:39,553
Gang-u couldn't swim.

569
01:16:39,636 --> 01:16:42,931
You need to move on with your life.

570
01:16:44,182 --> 01:16:45,559
Gang-u can swim.

571
01:16:53,400 --> 01:16:55,652
Father Hyeon's still not taking calls?

572
01:16:56,278 --> 01:16:58,238
It must've been a big shock.

573
01:17:02,034 --> 01:17:04,161
Still, he could've come to the funeral.

574
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:12,419
Gang-u!

575
01:17:13,754 --> 01:17:14,588
Gang-u!

576
01:17:19,217 --> 01:17:20,761
I'm Sang-hyeon, ma'am.

577
01:17:21,261 --> 01:17:22,679
I know I'm all wet.

578
01:17:22,763 --> 01:17:24,306
My poor baby.

579
01:17:25,140 --> 01:17:26,642
What took you so long?

580
01:17:26,725 --> 01:17:28,644
Why didn't you call?

581
01:17:29,603 --> 01:17:31,229
Bastard! You son of a bitch!

582
01:17:31,313 --> 01:17:32,606
You bastard!

583
01:17:34,483 --> 01:17:36,735
-Oh my!
-Mrs. Ra!

584
01:17:36,818 --> 01:17:39,029
-Wake up, Mrs. Ra!
-Bring some water!

585
01:17:39,112 --> 01:17:40,614
My goodness.

586
01:17:41,323 --> 01:17:44,493
Mrs. Ra, drink this.

587
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:52,584
This is why we should all watch
our blood pressures.

588
01:17:53,585 --> 01:17:54,920
Watch our drinking.

589
01:17:55,671 --> 01:17:57,339
And stay away from salty foods.

590
01:17:59,883 --> 01:18:04,346
Let's give Mrs. Ra
our positive energy, oasis-style.

591
01:18:04,429 --> 01:18:06,765
We should cheer her up.

592
01:18:07,557 --> 01:18:09,768
Starting with Tae-ju.

593
01:18:12,771 --> 01:18:13,605
Mom.

594
01:18:14,481 --> 01:18:17,734
How long has it been?

595
01:19:00,777 --> 01:19:01,903
Why are you so wet?

596
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:03,572
What?

597
01:19:07,242 --> 01:19:08,201
Is there a leak?

598
01:19:11,371 --> 01:19:12,873
Why is it so damp?

599
01:19:18,128 --> 01:19:20,547
Come here and don't bother.

600
01:19:27,637 --> 01:19:29,806
It's all psychological.

601
01:19:32,309 --> 01:19:34,603
Stop making a fuss
and will you come here?

602
01:20:30,742 --> 01:20:31,952
Was he here, too?

603
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:38,375
He? Who?

604
01:21:57,621 --> 01:21:58,538
Don't fall for it.

605
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,041
It's all just an illusion.

606
01:22:01,124 --> 01:22:02,626
Of course.

607
01:22:02,709 --> 01:22:04,336
It's just psychological.

608
01:23:04,270 --> 01:23:05,105
Are you leaving?

609
01:23:09,150 --> 01:23:14,239
How can someone do it
five times, straight?

610
01:24:06,416 --> 01:24:10,003
Mom never once
threw me a birthday party.

611
01:24:19,095 --> 01:24:19,929
How dare you.

612
01:24:38,114 --> 01:24:41,910
But she always gave me plenty to eat.

613
01:24:44,204 --> 01:24:45,413
Then thank her.

614
01:24:48,208 --> 01:24:49,167
Thank you.

615
01:24:54,547 --> 01:24:55,715
You know.

616
01:24:56,216 --> 01:24:58,551
Can't you go see that detective?

617
01:24:59,094 --> 01:25:00,428
Aren't you thirsty these days?

618
01:25:05,850 --> 01:25:08,061
I'll throw you a birthday party this year.

619
01:25:11,356 --> 01:25:14,484
Really?
The first birthday party in my life?

620
01:25:16,402 --> 01:25:19,322
But I don't know

621
01:25:19,864 --> 01:25:21,282
when my birthday is.

622
01:25:35,630 --> 01:25:37,549
But who made you boss?

623
01:25:38,550 --> 01:25:40,885
Telling me this and that
and hitting me around.

624
01:25:42,804 --> 01:25:45,765
Gang-u never laid a hand on me.

625
01:26:32,187 --> 01:26:36,232
Did Gang-u beat you or not?

626
01:26:37,817 --> 01:26:39,611
Why does that matter?

627
01:26:41,571 --> 01:26:43,323
That's why he died.

628
01:26:44,073 --> 01:26:45,742
Don't make excuses.

629
01:26:46,576 --> 01:26:48,494
You would've killed him anyway.

630
01:26:49,329 --> 01:26:52,707
So you can have me for yourself.

631
01:26:52,790 --> 01:26:54,792
Do you know how hard I tried

632
01:26:55,335 --> 01:26:56,544
not to kill people?

633
01:26:59,756 --> 01:27:01,633
You can't even begin to imagine.

634
01:27:04,093 --> 01:27:07,055
A bloodthirsty beast
is growling inside me.

635
01:27:08,389 --> 01:27:11,226
But I tiptoed around,
afraid I might hurt anyone.

636
01:27:14,562 --> 01:27:16,022
I killed him because of you.

637
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,276
To save you.

638
01:27:23,780 --> 01:27:25,073
To save me?

639
01:27:28,910 --> 01:27:30,912
Then why am I living a nightmare?

640
01:27:32,914 --> 01:27:35,124
I stay up trembling at the thought

641
01:27:35,667 --> 01:27:39,879
of your cold hand touching me.

642
01:27:40,713 --> 01:27:41,798
How did this happen?

643
01:27:49,806 --> 01:27:50,974
Mom.

644
01:27:53,935 --> 01:27:54,894
Mom.

645
01:27:55,979 --> 01:27:57,772
I'm done for.

646
01:27:57,855 --> 01:27:59,774
He's going to kill me.

647
01:28:00,441 --> 01:28:02,068
Poor Gang-u.

648
01:28:02,860 --> 01:28:05,947
No, you're the poorest, Mom.

649
01:28:07,073 --> 01:28:11,202
You treated that devil like a son
and this is what you get?

650
01:28:13,121 --> 01:28:14,289
Did I do it alone?

651
01:28:15,832 --> 01:28:17,542
-It was--
-Your idea.

652
01:28:23,464 --> 01:28:26,342
No, it was his idea.

653
01:28:26,426 --> 01:28:28,553
He said he'll kill the mother and the son.

654
01:28:29,721 --> 01:28:31,014
I'm not lying!

655
01:29:04,297 --> 01:29:07,675
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

656
01:29:09,469 --> 01:29:12,555
We were a happy family of three
till you infested us.

657
01:29:13,097 --> 01:29:14,349
You're a germ!

658
01:29:20,188 --> 01:29:23,316
You said I was cute, you cunt.

659
01:29:35,620 --> 01:29:37,622
Mommy.

660
01:29:38,998 --> 01:29:40,375
Wake up.

661
01:29:41,959 --> 01:29:43,628
You can't die like this.

662
01:29:45,380 --> 01:29:46,255
Mommy.

663
01:29:50,093 --> 01:29:52,804
Tell me you forgive me.

664
01:29:53,763 --> 01:29:56,224
Mom, look at me.

665
01:29:56,766 --> 01:30:00,978
If you forgive me, blink once.

666
01:30:01,062 --> 01:30:03,439
Just one blink? Please?

667
01:30:06,484 --> 01:30:07,568
Just once?

668
01:30:08,361 --> 01:30:10,154
Just once, please?

669
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:21,040
Let's go.

670
01:30:21,124 --> 01:30:23,918
That devil will suck
all the blood out of you, too!

671
01:30:29,048 --> 01:30:30,091
Let go!

672
01:30:32,343 --> 01:30:33,511
Let go!

673
01:30:40,226 --> 01:30:41,519
Stay back!

674
01:30:41,602 --> 01:30:42,728
You devil!

675
01:30:52,071 --> 01:30:53,573
I want to go to Gang-u.

676
01:30:54,323 --> 01:30:55,867
Kill me, please.

677
01:30:55,950 --> 01:30:57,452
You want to go?

678
01:31:00,705 --> 01:31:02,415
Go to your husband?

679
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:10,006
Really?

680
01:35:52,830 --> 01:35:54,749
Happy birthday, Tae-ju.

681
01:36:00,796 --> 01:36:02,339
Make it completely white.

682
01:36:03,549 --> 01:36:04,800
Just like daylight.

683
01:37:12,117 --> 01:37:14,453
That's a good girl.

684
01:37:14,537 --> 01:37:16,247
Well done.

685
01:37:16,956 --> 01:37:18,958
From now on,

686
01:37:19,041 --> 01:37:22,795
we wear shoes
inside the house like in the States.

687
01:37:23,295 --> 01:37:24,964
Because I'm in charge now.

688
01:37:26,757 --> 01:37:30,302
You have to sleep during the day, too.

689
01:37:31,136 --> 01:37:32,471
And eat at night...

690
01:37:35,182 --> 01:37:36,141
Did you just move?

691
01:37:44,900 --> 01:37:46,944
Watch TV while I'm out.

692
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:52,867
A scary movie is going to be on.

693
01:40:04,832 --> 01:40:06,291
I'm not ashamed at all!

694
01:40:08,002 --> 01:40:10,671
I told you I'll get the blood.

695
01:40:11,296 --> 01:40:12,548
Stealing from the hospital?

696
01:40:12,631 --> 01:40:14,550
-There's more.
-What?

697
01:40:14,633 --> 01:40:16,844
I'm helping people
who want to commit suicide.

698
01:40:16,927 --> 01:40:19,722
I know many people like that
from listening to confessions.

699
01:40:20,514 --> 01:40:23,434
If I run out,
I'll find more through the internet.

700
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:25,894
They face death

701
01:40:26,729 --> 01:40:30,566
more peacefully if I help them.

702
01:40:35,362 --> 01:40:37,698
If they just give it to you,
what fun is that?

703
01:40:47,374 --> 01:40:49,084
It tastes much better this way.

704
01:40:49,835 --> 01:40:51,670
How many has to die for your taste?

705
01:40:52,755 --> 01:40:54,006
Maybe

706
01:40:54,089 --> 01:40:58,052
around 500? How's that, Father?

707
01:40:58,969 --> 01:41:00,846
I told you I'm not a priest anymore!

708
01:41:01,430 --> 01:41:02,306
Oh dear,

709
01:41:03,348 --> 01:41:04,808
Father is mad.

710
01:41:06,185 --> 01:41:07,811
Stop acting so humane.

711
01:41:07,895 --> 01:41:09,688
You're not even human.

712
01:41:11,857 --> 01:41:12,858
Then what are we?

713
01:41:12,941 --> 01:41:15,110
We're human-eating beasts.

714
01:41:22,576 --> 01:41:24,536
Is it a sin for a fox to eat a chicken?

715
01:41:50,104 --> 01:41:52,481
Don't make me regret saving you.

716
01:41:53,857 --> 01:41:54,900
Kill me or save me,

717
01:41:55,776 --> 01:41:58,362
you'll regret either way.

718
01:41:59,113 --> 01:42:00,697
Let's break up now.

719
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,711
You drop me like that

720
01:42:15,921 --> 01:42:17,464
because I wanted to break up?

721
01:42:27,057 --> 01:42:29,434
You're the only one I've got now.

722
01:42:30,477 --> 01:42:32,187
HAPPY HANBOK

723
01:42:32,271 --> 01:42:34,273
Hey, come out quick.

724
01:42:46,869 --> 01:42:48,912
Hey, come out quick.

725
01:43:42,049 --> 01:43:45,510
You said women are safe from EV.

726
01:43:46,011 --> 01:43:50,682
Your blood is completely mixed with mine.

727
01:43:51,516 --> 01:43:52,351
Then,

728
01:43:53,727 --> 01:43:55,687
I'm no longer a woman?

729
01:44:07,074 --> 01:44:08,158
Hang in there.

730
01:44:13,038 --> 01:44:14,081
I'll get a doctor.

731
01:44:51,994 --> 01:44:52,911
Hello.

732
01:44:56,248 --> 01:44:57,374
Hello--

733
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:27,654
Tae-ju.

734
01:45:29,823 --> 01:45:31,241
What day is it today?

735
01:45:40,751 --> 01:45:43,795
The eyes are so telling.

736
01:45:43,879 --> 01:45:45,589
They can express everything

737
01:45:45,672 --> 01:45:48,300
between yes and no.

738
01:45:48,383 --> 01:45:51,386
How do you communicate
with just a yes and a no?

739
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:55,390
You need a subject
and verb to communicate.

740
01:45:58,268 --> 01:46:02,147
The subject is what's being stared at.

741
01:46:03,148 --> 01:46:05,776
If you stare at something
for over four seconds,

742
01:46:06,443 --> 01:46:10,238
others will automatically
turn to look, too.

743
01:46:10,989 --> 01:46:12,449
Is that a published study?

744
01:46:14,743 --> 01:46:16,203
I haven't had the chance to yet.

745
01:46:17,913 --> 01:46:21,833
I'm an expert at reading the eyes
after two years of marriage.

746
01:46:23,418 --> 01:46:24,961
That's why her Korean's not improving.

747
01:46:25,045 --> 01:46:27,714
Can you tell what Mom's saying?

748
01:46:27,798 --> 01:46:29,508
That's what I'm talking about.

749
01:46:30,092 --> 01:46:33,637
Tae-ju just saw me peek over at Mrs. Ra.

750
01:46:34,346 --> 01:46:38,558
She knew what I was going to say,
before I said it.

751
01:46:39,184 --> 01:46:40,811
By glancing at my eyes.

752
01:46:43,105 --> 01:46:44,398
Mrs. Ra said I'd win

753
01:46:45,107 --> 01:46:48,026
if I took this piece.

754
01:46:48,735 --> 01:46:51,238
And that she wants some vodka.

755
01:46:51,780 --> 01:46:52,614
Vodka.

756
01:46:55,367 --> 01:46:56,243
I win.

757
01:46:57,327 --> 01:47:00,163
Closed, self-draw,
bonus three points, big three dragons.

758
01:47:01,998 --> 01:47:03,792
See that?

759
01:47:05,252 --> 01:47:06,128
Thank you,

760
01:47:06,670 --> 01:47:07,921
Mrs. Ra.

761
01:47:10,298 --> 01:47:12,342
You want to play that bad?

762
01:47:14,553 --> 01:47:15,554
Oh, right.

763
01:47:15,637 --> 01:47:17,973
How about teaming her up with Evelyn?

764
01:47:19,057 --> 01:47:23,228
If you blink, it means "yes."

765
01:47:23,937 --> 01:47:26,857
A long blink means "no."

766
01:47:27,732 --> 01:47:28,859
Okay?

767
01:47:28,942 --> 01:47:31,778
Blink if you understand.

768
01:47:43,623 --> 01:47:44,624
Throw it away.

769
01:47:45,375 --> 01:47:46,918
Mrs. Ra is back.

770
01:47:47,586 --> 01:47:49,880
Evelyn? Vodka.

771
01:48:07,481 --> 01:48:08,315
"D."

772
01:48:09,274 --> 01:48:10,108
"D"?

773
01:48:11,276 --> 01:48:12,402
"D," what?

774
01:48:13,236 --> 01:48:14,946
Is she moving her finger?

775
01:48:16,364 --> 01:48:17,741
What's wrong with her nail?

776
01:48:18,783 --> 01:48:20,368
Wait.

777
01:48:20,452 --> 01:48:21,286
"L."

778
01:48:22,329 --> 01:48:24,247
-"L"?
-"L," it's another letter.

779
01:48:24,331 --> 01:48:26,458
-What?
-What is it?

780
01:48:26,541 --> 01:48:27,375
What?

781
01:48:28,919 --> 01:48:30,003
"L, D."

782
01:48:30,921 --> 01:48:31,755
Or "D, L"?

783
01:48:32,255 --> 01:48:34,549
"D" comes last, "L, D."

784
01:48:35,050 --> 01:48:36,551
Maybe she wants the LCD on?

785
01:48:37,219 --> 01:48:39,054
There's probably a C somewhere.

786
01:48:39,763 --> 01:48:41,389
"C."

787
01:48:42,349 --> 01:48:43,266
"C."

788
01:48:58,990 --> 01:48:59,866
Found it.

789
01:49:05,956 --> 01:49:07,874
"Kill"?

790
01:49:09,376 --> 01:49:10,544
"Kill all"?

791
01:49:19,427 --> 01:49:22,889
She definitely killed it all
in this round.

792
01:49:24,724 --> 01:49:26,142
"D" comes last.

793
01:49:26,226 --> 01:49:27,394
"Killed All."

794
01:49:27,477 --> 01:49:29,354
Mrs. Ra, is it "Kill all," right?

795
01:49:33,149 --> 01:49:34,901
She says, no.

796
01:49:35,443 --> 01:49:36,403
Then

797
01:49:37,696 --> 01:49:39,030
"KLD"? "Killed"?

798
01:49:40,031 --> 01:49:41,741
Am I right?

799
01:49:44,119 --> 01:49:45,161
See?

800
01:49:45,787 --> 01:49:47,372
It's "Killed."

801
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:51,084
Whatever, let's keep playing.

802
01:49:52,627 --> 01:49:54,212
-Whose turn is it?
-Wait.

803
01:49:55,672 --> 01:49:57,173
Killed who?

804
01:50:12,897 --> 01:50:15,567
Mahjong brings back memories of Gang-u?

805
01:50:16,860 --> 01:50:19,946
Mom, it's not your fault.

806
01:50:20,030 --> 01:50:22,073
He didn't die because of you.

807
01:50:22,699 --> 01:50:24,951
Stop playing and go to bed.

808
01:50:27,495 --> 01:50:28,830
Tae-ju's so strong.

809
01:50:37,756 --> 01:50:40,508
Mrs. Ra, stop torturing yourself.

810
01:50:40,592 --> 01:50:42,218
Look at me.

811
01:50:42,969 --> 01:50:45,221
It was an accident. It was no one's fault.

812
01:50:45,305 --> 01:50:47,140
No one killed Gang-u.

813
01:51:20,799 --> 01:51:22,967
It's not like Tae-ju
and Sang-hyeon killed…

814
01:52:45,842 --> 01:52:48,011
Selfish humans.

815
01:52:49,888 --> 01:52:52,640
Bastards coming to play mahjong

816
01:52:52,724 --> 01:52:55,310
with a grieving family.

817
01:53:01,065 --> 01:53:01,900
What?

818
01:53:03,610 --> 01:53:05,945
Why you little shit.

819
01:53:09,240 --> 01:53:11,117
I'm leaving,

820
01:53:12,160 --> 01:53:14,496
because shit smells, not scares.

821
01:53:38,728 --> 01:53:41,189
Honey! No!

822
01:53:54,452 --> 01:53:55,578
Yeong-du.

823
01:53:56,663 --> 01:53:58,039
Yeong-du?

824
01:54:23,940 --> 01:54:25,024
Stop it.

825
01:55:12,030 --> 01:55:15,116
You easy-blood drinking coward.

826
01:55:57,158 --> 01:55:58,576
It's because he's dead

827
01:55:58,660 --> 01:56:00,536
and the heart stopped pumping.

828
01:56:03,790 --> 01:56:05,667
Cut off the ankles

829
01:56:06,542 --> 01:56:10,004
and hang them over the bathtub

830
01:56:10,088 --> 01:56:12,548
and let gravity do the rest.

831
01:56:14,467 --> 01:56:17,845
We can put the blood in tupperware
and keep it in the fridge.

832
01:56:19,889 --> 01:56:21,891
I thought of using a motor pump

833
01:56:21,975 --> 01:56:24,268
but this works best.

834
01:56:25,603 --> 01:56:28,022
Sucking a little
and throwing the body away

835
01:56:30,984 --> 01:56:32,777
is treating life too lightly, isn't it?

836
01:56:52,130 --> 01:56:53,339
Evelyn.

837
01:56:56,259 --> 01:56:57,844
How could I have made

838
01:56:58,720 --> 01:57:01,764
all those kimbaps without you?

839
01:57:03,182 --> 01:57:04,809
It's over now.

840
01:57:06,686 --> 01:57:07,937
Happy?

841
01:57:21,492 --> 01:57:24,954
Tae-ju. Listen to me carefully.

842
01:57:28,416 --> 01:57:29,751
Why do I have to run away?

843
01:57:34,380 --> 01:57:35,673
From my own house?

844
01:57:35,757 --> 01:57:39,385
Won't they search the house
when they find the four people missing?

845
01:57:47,518 --> 01:57:52,106
They'll barge into the house
without dusting off their shoes.

846
01:57:52,690 --> 01:57:54,567
If they open the wardrobe

847
01:57:54,650 --> 01:57:57,695
and the curtains in daylight,

848
01:57:57,779 --> 01:58:00,198
then we'll die?

849
01:58:04,911 --> 01:58:06,287
What are you doing?

850
01:58:11,959 --> 01:58:13,920
You already had your fill.

851
01:58:50,373 --> 01:58:51,707
Where are we going?

852
01:59:02,426 --> 01:59:03,803
Where are we going?

853
01:59:05,221 --> 01:59:06,389
The sun's coming up!

854
01:59:17,692 --> 01:59:18,526
What?

855
01:59:18,609 --> 01:59:19,527
What was it?

856
01:59:20,987 --> 01:59:22,572
There.

857
01:59:40,464 --> 01:59:43,050
Oh my.

858
01:59:55,271 --> 01:59:56,814
My...

859
02:00:41,817 --> 02:00:44,237
Didn't you have your fill from Evelyn?

860
02:07:23,594 --> 02:07:26,764
I wanted to live
with you forever and ever.

861
02:07:30,851 --> 02:07:32,436
Together again in hell then.

862
02:07:36,565 --> 02:07:37,858
When you're dead,

863
02:07:38,776 --> 02:07:39,652
you're dead.

864
02:07:42,363 --> 02:07:45,574
It's been fun, Father.

865
02:14:02,034 --> 02:14:07,039
