00:00:52,677 --> 00:00:54,596
EPISODE 4

2
00:00:57,599 --> 00:01:00,060
Ha-yeong's son looks awfully familiar.

3
00:01:00,852 --> 00:01:02,062
I wonder why.

4
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:05,106
Our brother-in-law

5
00:01:06,149 --> 00:01:07,108
is Chae Chi-su.

6
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,027
What? From the choir?

7
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:12,322
They dated
while attending the same college.

8
00:01:15,867 --> 00:01:18,912
Didn't you say her son was my age though?

9
00:01:20,497 --> 00:01:22,874
Did they have their son in college?

10
00:01:22,957 --> 00:01:26,878
A situation called for them
to get married early.

11
00:01:28,755 --> 00:01:30,298
I'll be damned!

12
00:01:31,174 --> 00:01:34,010
They say the innocent looking ones
always cause trouble.

13
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:37,180
This coming from someone
who painted herself out to be a nerd.

14
00:01:38,932 --> 00:01:39,766
Let's go.

15
00:01:40,266 --> 00:01:42,268
The house seems well sorted.

16
00:01:43,895 --> 00:01:45,146
Don't worry about me.

17
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:48,691
I'll take some time off
to make it to the States.

18
00:01:49,442 --> 00:01:52,403
Sure. Don't skip any meals either, Chi-su.

19
00:01:56,533 --> 00:01:57,575
Hold on.

20
00:02:03,164 --> 00:02:05,291
Don't tell me she's been staying here.

21
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:11,798
And she brought a guest?

22
00:02:14,884 --> 00:02:16,886
What song are we dancing to tomorrow?

23
00:02:16,970 --> 00:02:19,347
Which is more important?
Protesting or dancing?

24
00:02:19,931 --> 00:02:22,058
It doesn't matter as long as we're happy.

25
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:25,311
Then how about "First Love" by Clon?

26
00:02:25,436 --> 00:02:28,648
-I just loved being by your side
-I just loved being by your side

27
00:02:28,731 --> 00:02:32,944
-I don't know why I'm like this these days
-I don't know why I'm like this these days

28
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:44,247
Ha-yeong.

29
00:02:48,293 --> 00:02:49,460
Bahn Ha-ni.

30
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:58,803
-Bahn Ha-ni.
-Yes.

31
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:01,389
Ha-yeong.

32
00:03:03,558 --> 00:03:04,475
Who are you?

33
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:08,855
Ha-yeong, calm down and hear me out.

34
00:03:08,938 --> 00:03:11,357
-I'll explain everything.
-Explain what?

35
00:03:11,441 --> 00:03:14,068
She's the spitting image of you!

36
00:03:14,152 --> 00:03:16,863
Right. You know now that you've seen her.

37
00:03:16,946 --> 00:03:18,865
This doesn't make any sense.

38
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:22,243
This drove me just as crazy
when she appeared.

39
00:03:22,327 --> 00:03:24,370
Was this what you asked Seong-u about?

40
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,790
About sending someone back
who's from the past?

41
00:03:27,874 --> 00:03:30,335
-Were you referring to her?
-I'm sorry.

42
00:03:30,418 --> 00:03:34,839
But I really have no idea
what I'm supposed to do either.

43
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,466
Isn't it obvious?

44
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:43,264
Are you saying you know?

45
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:48,478
Send her back to her father!

46
00:03:51,606 --> 00:03:52,440
Her father?

47
00:03:59,030 --> 00:04:01,074
Mom!

48
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:02,825
Scarlett!

49
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:04,327
Mom, don't send me back.

50
00:04:04,410 --> 00:04:05,411
Scarlett…

51
00:04:06,204 --> 00:04:07,872
I want to live with you.

52
00:04:07,956 --> 00:04:10,833
Scarlett? Is her father a foreigner?

53
00:04:12,335 --> 00:04:13,169
I'm sorry.

54
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:16,714
-Are you kidding me?
-That hurts!

55
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,424
-You're insane!
-I'm sorry.

56
00:04:18,508 --> 00:04:21,177
-I'm sorry.
-What are you doing? Let go of her!

57
00:04:22,303 --> 00:04:24,764
-Shut up!
-Who do you think you are, Bald Eagle?

58
00:04:41,698 --> 00:04:42,573
Get out.

59
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,868
Get out of my house!

60
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:51,040
Are we staying at the dry sauna again?

61
00:04:51,124 --> 00:04:53,293
It's uncomfortable there.

62
00:04:54,669 --> 00:04:58,589
I can't believe you're saying this
when you got us kicked out.

63
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:01,217
Then what? Should I tell her who I am?

64
00:05:01,926 --> 00:05:05,972
Be grateful that my fast-thinking
is what got us out of that mess.

65
00:05:06,055 --> 00:05:10,018
My goodness. Sure thing.
I couldn't be more grateful.

66
00:05:10,101 --> 00:05:12,395
I appreciate you
coming to me from the future.

67
00:05:12,478 --> 00:05:15,273
I've been blessed
by your boundless generosity.

68
00:05:16,691 --> 00:05:20,611
If that's how you feel, buy me tteokbokki.

69
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,781
I'm also craving some hot fish cake soup.

70
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,159
Hey!

71
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,331
My gosh, Mother.

72
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:34,292
It's not like
I left you alone for too long.

73
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:37,128
I have to find it.

74
00:05:38,254 --> 00:05:42,008
-Our Ha-ni is here.
-Why would she be here at this hour?

75
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,720
Not that bitch, but our Ha-ni.

76
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,681
What nonsense are you going on about?

77
00:05:48,765 --> 00:05:50,767
Mother? Mother!

78
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,269
Mother, please snap out of it.

79
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:02,362
Ok-jeong,
where have you been all this time

80
00:06:02,445 --> 00:06:05,114
when the house is a right mess?

81
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:07,575
Mother, my gosh.

82
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,577
You're killing me.

83
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:13,456
All the sewing was done by hand
and not a machine.

84
00:06:13,539 --> 00:06:16,501
The Italian cashmere
gives it a soft touch and lightweight.

85
00:06:16,959 --> 00:06:19,629
While keeping it traditional,
the design also includes

86
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,381
the current trend in coats.

87
00:06:21,464 --> 00:06:24,592
-Also--
-It's a one-and-only limited edition.

88
00:06:24,675 --> 00:06:28,679
Of course. That's why we're only
showcasing this to our VIP customers.

89
00:06:29,263 --> 00:06:31,391
It's pretty. I wonder what I should do.

90
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:35,269
I guess I'll have to think about it…

91
00:06:41,275 --> 00:06:43,194
You said it was a limited edition.

92
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,114
Yes, and only two are being sold in Korea.

93
00:06:46,197 --> 00:06:49,075
How is it a limited edition
when there are two?

94
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:56,165
You seem familiar. Have we met before?

95
00:06:56,958 --> 00:07:00,002
No, but then again
I'm not good with men's faces.

96
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:04,674
You don't know me?

97
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:07,427
Were you born overseas?

98
00:07:08,636 --> 00:07:10,930
Is there a reason why I should know you?

99
00:07:12,932 --> 00:07:15,101
Whatever. Just take off that coat.

100
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:17,228
I'd rather die than wear the same one.

101
00:07:17,311 --> 00:07:20,481
Let's be honest here.
I look better than you wearing this,

102
00:07:20,565 --> 00:07:23,693
so take it off yourself.
It's also very expensive.

103
00:07:25,736 --> 00:07:28,781
You must really not know who I am.

104
00:07:28,865 --> 00:07:32,243
You'll be surprised
when you find out who I am.

105
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:36,122
SON OF A CEO VERSUS TOP CELEBRITY

106
00:07:36,706 --> 00:07:40,168
I only came by
to check out the new product.

107
00:07:40,251 --> 00:07:44,005
I only wanted to try it on
before buying it second-hand.

108
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,840
SON OF A CEO VERSUS TOP CELEBRITY

109
00:07:45,923 --> 00:07:48,968
OLD NEWS VERSUS RICH BOY WHO WAS CUT OFF

110
00:07:49,051 --> 00:07:50,511
Are you both going to buy it?

111
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:53,055
-Of course, and no installments.
-Cash.

112
00:08:10,281 --> 00:08:13,117
You've got to be kidding me.

113
00:08:15,203 --> 00:08:18,664
Hey. How can you be up
for a bath right now?

114
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,082
Why can't I be?

115
00:08:20,166 --> 00:08:23,461
The juice is sweet and the water is warm.

116
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:24,712
It's the best.

117
00:08:26,088 --> 00:08:30,968
You really don't worry
about anything, do you?

118
00:08:31,052 --> 00:08:32,762
Why bother worrying

119
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,097
when I'll be back home
when it rains again?

120
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:45,358
Tell me about it.
I really hope it rains soon.

121
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:48,694
This place is the bomb though.

122
00:08:49,070 --> 00:08:51,322
Can't we just live here
for the time being?

123
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,534
Once we spend the money Seong-u gave us,
we'll have to leave.

124
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:57,703
How can you be that old
and not have your own house?

125
00:08:57,787 --> 00:09:00,206
Half the people in Korea don't own homes.

126
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:03,960
Exactly. So why did you have
to be a part of that half?

127
00:09:05,253 --> 00:09:08,005
-And you're mooching off me right now.
-Stop hitting me!

128
00:09:08,089 --> 00:09:09,882
I'm doing this because I want to.

129
00:09:09,966 --> 00:09:12,218
I'd love to go back to my own time.

130
00:09:13,302 --> 00:09:16,764
Back there, I have a home, parents,
friends, and I'm also popular.

131
00:09:16,847 --> 00:09:19,517
But here? I have nothing!

132
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:21,227
Fine.

133
00:09:21,852 --> 00:09:24,897
I'm sorry I only have
my old age to show for myself.

134
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:38,536
Can't we just find a place to stay
if we have money?

135
00:09:47,795 --> 00:09:49,297
What are you doing here?

136
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,426
What? Why are you here?

137
00:09:53,509 --> 00:09:54,969
Auntie.

138
00:09:55,803 --> 00:09:57,346
Who are you calling your aunt?

139
00:09:58,931 --> 00:10:01,976
Mom and I have nowhere to go.

140
00:10:02,059 --> 00:10:04,395
Can't you help us just this once?

141
00:10:07,815 --> 00:10:09,942
How can you look just like her?

142
00:10:11,444 --> 00:10:13,154
I don't want to see you, so leave.

143
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:18,242
Then give me money
so that I can go see Grandma.

144
00:10:18,326 --> 00:10:21,996
What? And have my mom faint on the spot?

145
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,040
No way!

146
00:10:24,749 --> 00:10:26,292
You never know.

147
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:29,211
She might be thrilled
to have a pretty granddaughter.

148
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,299
That's the same haughty expression
Ha-ni used to make back in the day.

149
00:10:34,133 --> 00:10:37,720
Meanwhile, you've changed a great deal.

150
00:10:37,803 --> 00:10:39,221
You were a loser after all.

151
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,307
Hey, how dare you?

152
00:10:41,390 --> 00:10:42,558
Besides…

153
00:10:44,727 --> 00:10:47,021
I'm not asking for charity.

154
00:10:47,104 --> 00:10:49,190
My mom's been your maid for years,

155
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,400
so you'll be paying her for her hard work!

156
00:10:54,028 --> 00:10:55,029
What's this?

157
00:11:04,288 --> 00:11:06,582
You're shameless, aren't you?

158
00:11:06,666 --> 00:11:09,418
How can you use your daughter
to extort money from me?

159
00:11:10,586 --> 00:11:11,671
I did?

160
00:11:12,171 --> 00:11:13,881
This won't happen a second time.

161
00:11:13,964 --> 00:11:16,884
Take the money
and manage your life with your daughter.

162
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:20,471
And don't tell Seong-u
since it's embarrassing.

163
00:11:21,055 --> 00:11:23,140
-Ha-yeong--
-Keep this from Mom as well.

164
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:26,560
She already fainted once
when I had Seong-u.

165
00:11:27,311 --> 00:11:29,063
Don't let history repeat itself.

166
00:11:30,189 --> 00:11:31,982
Got it. I'm sorry about this.

167
00:11:38,656 --> 00:11:42,159
Seriously? What on earth
did you say to Ha-yeong?

168
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:45,204
I told you to stay put and do nothing.

169
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:50,292
How many zeroes are there?

170
00:11:52,128 --> 00:11:53,587
It's 10 million won!

171
00:11:54,296 --> 00:11:55,464
What?

172
00:12:01,137 --> 00:12:02,138
Good job.

173
00:12:04,265 --> 00:12:05,683
You did well, my daughter!

174
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:17,695
Damn it.

175
00:12:21,490 --> 00:12:22,783
Anthony, we should go.

176
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,702
Ms. Kim must not be coming.

177
00:12:24,785 --> 00:12:27,455
He's right. It's already been two hours.

178
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:29,582
I need this role to get back on top.

179
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,167
Unbelievable.

180
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:33,711
But you aren't even
being considered for the show.

181
00:12:33,919 --> 00:12:35,546
How do you expect to get a part?

182
00:12:35,629 --> 00:12:37,548
It's why I must meet her in person.

183
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:39,717
How can you when you're being ignored?

184
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:47,057
Jeong-man, where does
Ms. Kim work these days?

185
00:12:47,141 --> 00:12:51,270
Who knows? All I heard are rumors
about a temple in the woods.

186
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:54,273
-Can you get me the location?
-What for?

187
00:12:54,356 --> 00:12:56,525
"It's the thirsty ones
who visit the bank."

188
00:12:57,026 --> 00:12:59,862
The bank? Shouldn't you dig a well?

189
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,990
As if anyone has time for that.
There's free water at banks.

190
00:13:03,657 --> 00:13:05,951
What matters
is that you get your damn water.

191
00:13:06,035 --> 00:13:07,328
That's the way of life.

192
00:13:08,662 --> 00:13:10,873
You're awesome, Anthony!

193
00:13:10,956 --> 00:13:12,458
-Have you lost it?
-Sorry.

194
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:14,376
Anyway, have these wrapped up to go.

195
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:17,213
She just had to be a regular
at an expensive place.

196
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:18,172
Got it.

197
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:28,140
I used to eat only
at Michelin-starred restaurants.

198
00:13:28,224 --> 00:13:29,475
Look where I am now.

199
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:34,688
What did the newbie just say?

200
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:36,148
What restaurant?

201
00:13:36,857 --> 00:13:38,818
Restaurant called "Ms. Lee's," I think.

202
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:39,985
Who's Ms. Lee?

203
00:13:40,069 --> 00:13:41,737
How should I know?

204
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:44,240
I know a Mr. Lee,

205
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,325
but not a Ms. Lee.

206
00:13:48,702 --> 00:13:50,287
Before I married--

207
00:13:50,371 --> 00:13:51,247
Ladies!

208
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,207
-What?
-What is it?

209
00:13:54,708 --> 00:13:58,003
I need a place to stay for a while.
Which hotel is the cheapest?

210
00:13:59,213 --> 00:14:01,715
-Is he immature or just dumb?
-Seriously?

211
00:14:02,842 --> 00:14:04,635
All hotels are pricey, you know.

212
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:08,347
Then where's a cheap place I can stay?
I'm kind of broke, you see.

213
00:14:09,974 --> 00:14:14,270
I guess student housing
would be the cheapest.

214
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:17,356
Can I stay in one
even though I'm not a student?

215
00:14:18,732 --> 00:14:20,192
Nice.

216
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:22,736
Geum-ja, this is bad.

217
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,780
The new guy must not be so bright.

218
00:14:26,156 --> 00:14:30,494
Standing all day
keeps the legs swollen, right?

219
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:36,500
Mi-ja, ask your husband
to massage your legs for you

220
00:14:36,584 --> 00:14:40,379
rather than other parts of your body.

221
00:14:41,797 --> 00:14:46,093
My gosh. You and your shameless remarks.

222
00:14:46,677 --> 00:14:50,723
I was referring to your shoulders.
Your mind must be in the gutter!

223
00:14:51,682 --> 00:14:53,893
-What?
-What the hell?

224
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:01,400
Because of the newbie, we won't
be able to talk so freely anymore.

225
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,652
Sorry? What did you say?

226
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,362
-Nothing. Come join us.
-Join us.

227
00:15:05,446 --> 00:15:08,282
Let your shoes dry and get some rest.

228
00:15:08,365 --> 00:15:10,367
How can you rest in this small room?

229
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:13,329
Are you kidding me? Back in the day,

230
00:15:13,579 --> 00:15:16,373
we had to crouch down
at the corner of the cafeteria.

231
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:18,292
Compared to that, this is heaven.

232
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:28,427
Are you sure that this is allowed?

233
00:15:28,510 --> 00:15:30,888
Who cares? We're employees too, right?

234
00:15:30,971 --> 00:15:33,223
I know he sort of dragged us here,

235
00:15:34,224 --> 00:15:35,976
but I still feel uncomfortable.

236
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:41,357
Don't you worry. I have connections
in this company, you see.

237
00:15:43,567 --> 00:15:47,321
As if. Just how great
is this so-called connection?

238
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,491
Are you perhaps acquainted
with the Head of Security?

239
00:15:50,574 --> 00:15:52,034
The Head of Security?

240
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:57,164
A connection that would matter
is one you'd have with the CEO.

241
00:16:03,796 --> 00:16:07,383
Geum-ja, it seems like that idiot
is a pathological liar too.

242
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,316
CAFETERIA EMPLOYEES ONLY

243
00:16:29,321 --> 00:16:31,865
SUPERMAN

244
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,742
This way, please. Come on.

245
00:16:38,622 --> 00:16:40,082
Why are you calling me?

246
00:16:40,165 --> 00:16:41,792
Buy me dinner.

247
00:16:42,292 --> 00:16:45,379
-Why?
-You agreed to pay me back.

248
00:16:45,462 --> 00:16:48,882
Thanks to me, you found the keyring
your dad made for you.

249
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,760
Right. But not today though.

250
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:53,387
I'm busy house hunting.

251
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,514
You're moving? Where to?

252
00:16:56,598 --> 00:16:58,142
Shinjae-dong…

253
00:16:59,435 --> 00:17:00,269
Why do you ask?

254
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:04,148
Got it. Just buy dinner when you're done.

255
00:17:07,818 --> 00:17:08,902
Seriously?

256
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:13,615
One mistake and now
he's trying to mooch off me.

257
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,367
Ja and Ja!

258
00:17:15,451 --> 00:17:17,453
-What?
-What is it?

259
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,079
When do we get off today?

260
00:17:19,580 --> 00:17:20,497
At 6 p.m.

261
00:17:20,789 --> 00:17:22,082
Can't I get off early?

262
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,459
Why? Is something up?

263
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,961
I need to go house hunting
in Shinjae-dong.

264
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,005
I see.

265
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,925
I understand your situation,

266
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:35,345
but the prepping for tomorrow
will take some time.

267
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:37,389
Where are the vegetables?

268
00:18:03,373 --> 00:18:05,793
-Gosh, that felt nice.
-It was really nice.

269
00:18:05,876 --> 00:18:08,212
-I even took a nap.
-It was great.

270
00:18:11,507 --> 00:18:13,092
Did that fool do this?

271
00:18:13,175 --> 00:18:14,134
That fool?

272
00:18:16,261 --> 00:18:18,639
JA AND JA,
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU

273
00:18:19,807 --> 00:18:23,352
The previous tenant lived here
all by herself,

274
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,853
so it's very clean.

275
00:18:24,937 --> 00:18:28,565
The landlord also took very good care
of this place.

276
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:31,527
It looks like we won't have to hang
new wallpapers.

277
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:32,820
-Yes.
-Of course.

278
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:35,447
Isn't this place a little tacky?

279
00:18:35,531 --> 00:18:37,699
This is more than good enough.

280
00:18:39,701 --> 00:18:41,453
How much is this place?

281
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,248
The deposit is 5 million,
and the rent is 200,000 won.

282
00:18:45,082 --> 00:18:46,416
Why is it so cheap?

283
00:18:46,959 --> 00:18:48,377
It's a really nice place.

284
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,963
Consider yourself lucky.

285
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:54,007
-Right?
-Yes, of course.

286
00:18:54,091 --> 00:18:56,510
Then we'll take it.

287
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,347
-When do you plan to move?
-Right now.

288
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,333
This is nice.

289
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:35,799
You're dressed like
you're going to the Himalayas.

290
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:37,551
It's pretty much the same thing.

291
00:19:37,926 --> 00:19:40,262
I need to conquer
and win over Ms. Kim's heart.

292
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,349
Why didn't you get changed?

293
00:19:45,142 --> 00:19:47,144
I'm always the only one who's prepared.

294
00:19:47,227 --> 00:19:50,147
I think I still feel a bit seasick.

295
00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:53,483
I didn't even go to the army

296
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:55,861
because I tore
my anterior cruciate ligament.

297
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:03,660
Instead, I'll be here praying for you.

298
00:20:06,663 --> 00:20:09,541
You both just want
to benefit off my career, don't you?

299
00:20:09,625 --> 00:20:11,460
You'd better wait here.

300
00:20:11,543 --> 00:20:13,420
Make sure he doesn't go anywhere.

301
00:20:13,503 --> 00:20:14,713
I don't feel well.

302
00:20:14,796 --> 00:20:16,798
-Really? Try to get it out of you.
-Okay.

303
00:20:19,468 --> 00:20:21,011
Anthony!

304
00:20:22,679 --> 00:20:24,097
I'm off now.

305
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,600
I need to go west…

306
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,445
He's quite unbelievable.

307
00:20:39,279 --> 00:20:42,199
Once he sets a goal,
he does everything to get it done.

308
00:20:42,866 --> 00:20:43,992
Gyeong-sik.

309
00:20:44,618 --> 00:20:47,454
He used to slack off in school,
so he may be a bit dumb.

310
00:20:48,580 --> 00:20:50,874
But he came this far
thanks to his tenacity.

311
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:37,713
Who are you?

312
00:21:39,089 --> 00:21:41,383
You came so far to write your script.

313
00:21:42,092 --> 00:21:44,011
I wanted to get here before mealtime.

314
00:21:45,012 --> 00:21:46,555
So I came as fast as I could.

315
00:21:47,806 --> 00:21:49,224
What…

316
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,226
Anthony?

317
00:21:51,310 --> 00:21:52,769
I'm glad you recognize me.

318
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:56,231
Yes, that's right. I'm Anthony.

319
00:21:56,815 --> 00:22:01,028
But what brings you all the way here?

320
00:22:02,946 --> 00:22:04,614
It's red sea bream.

321
00:22:04,698 --> 00:22:07,659
I heard you like wild fish,
so I brought you this.

322
00:22:07,743 --> 00:22:10,996
Why did you bring this here?

323
00:22:13,123 --> 00:22:14,958
Why don't you have a bite.

324
00:22:17,544 --> 00:22:20,088
Then I guess I'll have a taste.

325
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:26,720
How's the texture?

326
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,850
It's nice.

327
00:22:33,769 --> 00:22:34,895
Now tell me.

328
00:22:36,313 --> 00:22:41,276
How did this red sea bream end up
coming all the way

329
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:42,903
to the mountain?

330
00:22:43,487 --> 00:22:44,863
I'll be straightforward.

331
00:22:45,447 --> 00:22:47,741
I'd like you to cast me for your drama.

332
00:22:50,702 --> 00:22:54,873
Haven't we already settled the issue?

333
00:22:54,956 --> 00:22:56,208
No.

334
00:22:56,291 --> 00:23:00,045
Listen. I'll be honest with you.

335
00:23:00,128 --> 00:23:04,299
I'm not very fond of…

336
00:23:06,259 --> 00:23:09,471
your negative image.

337
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,015
Negative image?

338
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:17,104
I don't want to take the risk
of casting you for my drama.

339
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,482
I'm sorry.

340
00:23:20,565 --> 00:23:23,735
I'm sure it wasn't easy for you

341
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,281
to bring this sashimi all the way up here.

342
00:23:29,491 --> 00:23:30,659
I caught it myself.

343
00:23:31,868 --> 00:23:32,702
What?

344
00:23:33,745 --> 00:23:35,122
I went boat fishing

345
00:23:36,206 --> 00:23:39,292
-for over ten hours to catch this.
-Wait.

346
00:23:39,376 --> 00:23:43,130
You could have gotten this
at a fish market.

347
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:45,757
You didn't have to do that.

348
00:23:46,967 --> 00:23:49,177
It was because you're worth it.

349
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,014
I had to do that to capture your heart.

350
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:02,691
Anthony.

351
00:24:04,276 --> 00:24:08,238
You really know
how to make a person feel bad.

352
00:24:15,662 --> 00:24:17,914
I'll put your name up as a candidate.

353
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:20,792
Really?

354
00:24:21,501 --> 00:24:23,295
-Really?
-But…

355
00:24:25,797 --> 00:24:27,799
if you ever happen to get involved

356
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:33,096
in even the smallest scandal,

357
00:24:34,723 --> 00:24:36,933
I'll pretend like this never happened.

358
00:24:38,059 --> 00:24:41,938
I will make sure I don't get involved
in anything scandalous.

359
00:24:43,356 --> 00:24:44,733
I'll keep my eyes on you.

360
00:24:48,361 --> 00:24:52,199
By the way, how did you manage
to climb all the way up here?

361
00:24:52,782 --> 00:24:55,994
Goodness, what's there to ask?
I drove here.

362
00:24:57,078 --> 00:24:57,913
What?

363
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,791
There's a road that leads to this place.
Didn't you know?

364
00:25:06,588 --> 00:25:08,507
Look at this TV. It's huge.

365
00:25:08,590 --> 00:25:10,008
Unbelievable.

366
00:25:10,091 --> 00:25:11,551
This is so big.

367
00:25:11,635 --> 00:25:12,761
Get out of there.

368
00:25:12,844 --> 00:25:17,140
She's from the countryside.

369
00:25:17,766 --> 00:25:21,561
We're here to buy a fridge
and washing machine.

370
00:25:21,645 --> 00:25:23,563
Are you looking for a specific brand?

371
00:25:23,647 --> 00:25:25,857
Just the cheapest one will do.

372
00:25:25,941 --> 00:25:27,317
Okay. Just a second.

373
00:25:29,611 --> 00:25:30,612
Let's buy this too.

374
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:35,575
No one uses a cassette player these days.
I don't even have a cassette tape.

375
00:25:35,909 --> 00:25:37,911
I brought a few.

376
00:25:40,664 --> 00:25:41,623
Ta-da.

377
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:47,379
You still have this?

378
00:25:47,462 --> 00:25:49,172
I recorded it a few days ago.

379
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:52,634
I guess you're right.

380
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:06,439
This is your best room?
It's the same as the last one.

381
00:26:07,107 --> 00:26:08,608
There's a window.

382
00:26:08,692 --> 00:26:11,444
Student housings these days
try to provide a nice view.

383
00:26:11,736 --> 00:26:12,821
Oh, I see.

384
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,615
-How much is it?
-It's 370,000 won a month.

385
00:26:16,157 --> 00:26:19,286
But if you pay for three months
in advance, it's 350,000 won.

386
00:26:20,704 --> 00:26:23,707
Okay. I just need to live here
for 100 days.

387
00:26:23,790 --> 00:26:24,791
I'll take it.

388
00:26:24,874 --> 00:26:27,168
-Okay. Come to my office.
-Okay.

389
00:26:34,676 --> 00:26:36,094
It's pretty.

390
00:26:38,471 --> 00:26:40,098
If I didn't buy that coat,

391
00:26:40,181 --> 00:26:42,684
I would've been able to stay
at a better place.

392
00:26:45,687 --> 00:26:47,856
He said something about a nice view.

393
00:26:52,068 --> 00:26:54,529
Where the heck is my nice view?

394
00:26:58,199 --> 00:26:59,159
Hi, Aunt.

395
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:02,579
You're unbelievable.

396
00:27:03,163 --> 00:27:06,082
I'm 20 years older,
but you're making me carry everything.

397
00:27:06,333 --> 00:27:08,126
You're so rude.

398
00:27:08,209 --> 00:27:10,211
You were just like me.

399
00:27:14,716 --> 00:27:16,718
Hey, isn't he that beggar guy?

400
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:19,429
-Yu-hyeon.
-How are you?

401
00:27:19,512 --> 00:27:23,141
-I think you're right.
-He must live in this neighborhood.

402
00:27:23,224 --> 00:27:24,309
I guess so.

403
00:27:25,518 --> 00:27:28,730
But who's that rich-looking woman?

404
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:31,691
They're all limited edition.

405
00:27:31,775 --> 00:27:34,986
You really are the only person
who cares about me.

406
00:27:36,237 --> 00:27:40,033
But seriously, what's going on?
Why are you working at the cafeteria?

407
00:27:41,409 --> 00:27:43,870
And why are you
staying at a student housing?

408
00:27:43,953 --> 00:27:46,414
I just need to endure this for 100 days.

409
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,041
So stop worrying about me.

410
00:27:48,124 --> 00:27:51,503
It'll only make your pretty face
have more wrinkles.

411
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:56,132
-I think I know what he is.
-You are so cheeky.

412
00:27:56,925 --> 00:27:58,301
I saw it in a drama once.

413
00:27:59,010 --> 00:28:01,137
That gigolo in A Blue Bird Has It.

414
00:28:01,721 --> 00:28:04,808
-A Blue Bird Has It?
-Don't you remember?

415
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,894
The guy who goes "It's the best!"
The one with Jeol-bong.

416
00:28:08,395 --> 00:28:09,979
Oh, that show?

417
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:13,066
That drama is from ages ago.

418
00:28:13,650 --> 00:28:15,318
Gosh, anyway…

419
00:28:15,402 --> 00:28:18,613
That's what he is, right?
That's what gigolos do.

420
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:20,240
My goodness.

421
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,201
No wonder he was able
to get that money so quickly.

422
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:25,620
-I feel so upset.
-Just go.

423
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:27,872
My goodness.

424
00:28:28,498 --> 00:28:31,584
-He's a pervert and a gigolo?
-Go on.

425
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:32,711
Let's go.

426
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,213
Bye.

427
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:44,514
Hey, it's me. Did you look into
what I asked you to?

428
00:28:47,350 --> 00:28:48,351
I see.

429
00:28:48,977 --> 00:28:52,439
By the way, have someone tail Yu-hyeon.

430
00:28:53,481 --> 00:28:56,192
I will now begin a presentation
on Anthony's reputation

431
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,862
in the entertainment industry
and big data analysis

432
00:28:59,112 --> 00:29:01,489
so that he can get casted
for Ms. Kim's drama.

433
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:06,619
Gyeong-sik, don't feel bad.
Just tell me the truth.

434
00:29:06,703 --> 00:29:07,871
Okay.

435
00:29:09,414 --> 00:29:12,917
First of all, here are
some positive images of Anthony.

436
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,628
People think he's handsome, well-dressed,

437
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:18,631
has nice teeth, and amazing skin.

438
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:20,592
Now it's time for the negative stuff.

439
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:23,386
People think he's rude, arrogant,
loves sponsorship,

440
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:25,972
two-faced, has a horrible personality,
dumb,

441
00:29:26,055 --> 00:29:27,599
and doesn't know how to spell.

442
00:29:27,807 --> 00:29:29,768
For example, let's see his recent post.

443
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:34,647
He wrote,
"Be careful not to capture a cold."

444
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,401
There was also, "I am glarying at you."

445
00:29:38,485 --> 00:29:41,780
These two posts made 2,000 fans
cancel their fan page memberships.

446
00:29:41,946 --> 00:29:44,282
It was a very shocking incident
among the fans.

447
00:29:44,365 --> 00:29:48,203
You know what?
This actually reminds me of the live chat.

448
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:51,790
He wanted to say, "You're so funny
that it cracks me up."

449
00:29:52,165 --> 00:29:54,584
But he said, "You're so funny
that I do crack."

450
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:57,128
His fans were so shocked
that they all logged out.

451
00:29:57,420 --> 00:29:58,630
Do you remember that?

452
00:29:58,713 --> 00:30:00,757
But I must say, this was the best one.

453
00:30:01,883 --> 00:30:04,552
"Lock up the barn
after the dog is stolen."

454
00:30:10,391 --> 00:30:13,812
Gosh, seriously. I remember that one.

455
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:17,857
You have no idea
how much of an issue it was.

456
00:30:17,941 --> 00:30:20,944
His fans kept calling the agency

457
00:30:21,027 --> 00:30:25,156
asking us to stop him
from posting on social media.

458
00:30:27,075 --> 00:30:29,077
There's no need to dwell in the past.

459
00:30:29,160 --> 00:30:29,994
There's more.

460
00:30:30,078 --> 00:30:33,748
"Plastic surgery addict, looks older
than his age, failed all his movies,

461
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:36,376
very hard to like,
looks tacky for some reason."

462
00:30:36,459 --> 00:30:37,293
That's a lot.

463
00:30:37,377 --> 00:30:38,962
I've heard enough. Let's stop.

464
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,255
No, there's still more.

465
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:43,675
"Poop machine, plastic surgery monster,
idiot, high maintenance,

466
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:45,301
has a nasty personality, and…"

467
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,597
Where is Anthony?

468
00:30:50,098 --> 00:30:51,266
You prepared too much.

469
00:30:53,893 --> 00:30:56,104
I told you to stop, Gyeong-sik.

470
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:05,697
We should be eating jjajangmyeon.

471
00:31:05,780 --> 00:31:08,199
Why do we always have to eat instant food?

472
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,120
Why are you complaining
after having finished everything?

473
00:31:12,203 --> 00:31:15,582
Plus, I even got you pickled radish.
This stuff is expensive.

474
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,918
If we went to a Chinese restaurant,
this would have been free.

475
00:31:23,172 --> 00:31:24,048
Old lady.

476
00:31:25,008 --> 00:31:26,843
Do you live in this neighborhood?

477
00:31:26,926 --> 00:31:29,095
Yes, we moved here today.

478
00:31:29,178 --> 00:31:32,599
Gosh, how interesting. I live here too.

479
00:31:32,682 --> 00:31:34,767
I guess it must be fate.

480
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,020
No, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

481
00:31:37,103 --> 00:31:40,356
Coincidences stack and become fate.

482
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:42,901
Now that we're neighbors,

483
00:31:42,984 --> 00:31:45,653
I'll give you a beer.
You gave me some last time.

484
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,407
No, it's okay. I'm not done unpacking,
so I need to get going now.

485
00:31:49,490 --> 00:31:51,826
I'll leave you to eat.

486
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,588
Hey, listen. Mr. Blue Bird.

487
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:05,548
What? What bird?

488
00:32:06,674 --> 00:32:10,261
Do me a favor
and stop hitting on my mom, okay?

489
00:32:11,262 --> 00:32:12,221
"Mom"?

490
00:32:14,390 --> 00:32:16,851
No wonder you seemed so familiar.

491
00:32:17,894 --> 00:32:20,980
How young was she when she had you?

492
00:32:21,648 --> 00:32:24,984
Stop being so curious about my family.

493
00:32:25,610 --> 00:32:28,821
My mom may not be
in her best condition right now,

494
00:32:28,905 --> 00:32:31,950
but she used to be really popular
in the past.

495
00:32:32,033 --> 00:32:36,162
You're not on the same level as her.

496
00:32:36,245 --> 00:32:39,832
"Level"? I'm on the highest level
anyone can be.

497
00:32:39,916 --> 00:32:42,168
You'll be shocked once you hear who I am.

498
00:32:43,378 --> 00:32:44,837
I already know.

499
00:32:45,713 --> 00:32:49,175
So don't ever hit on my mom again.

500
00:32:57,558 --> 00:32:59,894
That rude brat.

501
00:33:03,147 --> 00:33:04,857
I feel so bad for her.

502
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,698
What's taking you so long?

503
00:33:11,781 --> 00:33:13,783
I'm buying water and food for tomorrow.

504
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,538
I'm warning you.
Don't ever get involved with that guy.

505
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:23,209
The moment you do,
your life will become a complete mess.

506
00:33:23,292 --> 00:33:25,753
-You know that, right?
-Do you think I'm crazy?

507
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:31,759
By the way, you've been talking to me
like I'm your friend for a while now.

508
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:36,973
I mean, I can't keep being distant.

509
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:40,601
And it'd be weird
to use honorifics to myself.

510
00:33:41,561 --> 00:33:44,605
I get what you mean,
but it doesn't feel nice.

511
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:49,986
You know you've been looking down on me
ever since you got money, right?

512
00:33:50,570 --> 00:33:52,530
If it upsets you, try to do better.

513
00:33:53,364 --> 00:33:55,950
I should've been more humble in the past.

514
00:33:56,034 --> 00:33:58,578
People must have hated me so much.

515
00:34:03,166 --> 00:34:04,751
Do you need a bag? It's 20 won.

516
00:34:04,834 --> 00:34:08,671
Can I also get a big-sized
standard plastic bag?

517
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:12,383
Did you move here? You guys look new.

518
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:17,680
Yes, we moved to the house with red bricks

519
00:34:17,764 --> 00:34:20,058
that's located
at the far end of the alley.

520
00:34:20,141 --> 00:34:23,728
You moved into the rooftop house?

521
00:34:23,811 --> 00:34:25,146
Yes. Why?

522
00:34:25,229 --> 00:34:28,858
My goodness. You two must be fearless.

523
00:34:29,525 --> 00:34:31,235
What do you mean?

524
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,820
Didn't you hear?

525
00:34:32,904 --> 00:34:35,698
Apparently, that place is haunted.

526
00:34:35,782 --> 00:34:38,201
All the tenants
moved out in less than a month.

527
00:34:38,284 --> 00:34:39,410
It's haunted?

528
00:34:43,623 --> 00:34:44,957
Let's move right now.

529
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,001
I can't live here.

530
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:48,294
Do you have money?

531
00:34:49,629 --> 00:34:52,507
Are you saying we should live here
with a ghost?

532
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:55,968
Why not? I'm living with
someone from the past.

533
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,554
But I'm really scared of ghosts.

534
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:03,101
You must not know this
since you're still young.

535
00:35:03,184 --> 00:35:07,063
Humans are scarier than ghosts.
And money is scarier than humans.

536
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:12,193
Ghosts don't kill people,
but you could die if you have no money.

537
00:35:12,276 --> 00:35:13,945
Then what are we supposed to do?

538
00:35:15,071 --> 00:35:18,324
I'll make sure
this place doesn't get haunted.

539
00:35:19,075 --> 00:35:20,201
So don't worry.

540
00:35:27,333 --> 00:35:28,292
It stinks.

541
00:35:29,001 --> 00:35:30,586
Does this really repel ghosts?

542
00:35:30,670 --> 00:35:32,046
Of course.

543
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,590
We even hung a cross.

544
00:35:35,967 --> 00:35:37,760
That cross reminds me of grandma.

545
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,388
Does she still go to mass?

546
00:35:41,222 --> 00:35:42,306
Yes.

547
00:35:43,349 --> 00:35:45,810
Can I hear her voice one time?

548
00:35:46,602 --> 00:35:49,522
I won't say anything, so let me.

549
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,316
She's probably asleep right now.

550
00:35:53,442 --> 00:35:54,277
Go to bed.

551
00:36:04,287 --> 00:36:05,621
I'm so scared.

552
00:36:07,915 --> 00:36:09,000
Should we sing?

553
00:36:09,083 --> 00:36:12,044
Do you want to see a snake
in the middle of the night?

554
00:36:15,381 --> 00:36:19,635
Our journey together

555
00:36:20,553 --> 00:36:22,972
May be difficult

556
00:36:23,931 --> 00:36:29,562
But you can always count on me

557
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,572
Do you finally understand

558
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:43,075
The hopes I have for you?

559
00:36:43,159 --> 00:36:45,828
With this small heart of mine

560
00:36:45,912 --> 00:36:49,582
-I love you
-I love you

561
00:36:51,250 --> 00:36:57,798
-Stay by my side forever
-Stay by my side forever

562
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:04,972
-I want you to fulfill my dream
-I want you to fulfill my dream

563
00:37:06,265 --> 00:37:08,976
-Hear me out
-Hear me out

564
00:37:09,560 --> 00:37:13,981
You will be

565
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,736
My one and only

566
00:37:47,181 --> 00:37:49,225
-Are you ready?
-You bet.

567
00:37:49,308 --> 00:37:52,270
You seemed
a little out of breath yesterday.

568
00:37:52,353 --> 00:37:56,107
-Will you manage?
-Don't you worry. I've still got it.

569
00:38:00,111 --> 00:38:01,404
THIS IS UNFAIR

570
00:39:06,886 --> 00:39:09,055
JOA CONFECTIONERY
SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

571
00:39:47,968 --> 00:39:50,805
SQUID-GOOD INCIDENT WAS FABRICATED
UNFAIRLY DISMISSED

572
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,276
I'll proceed as planned.

573
00:40:04,360 --> 00:40:05,444
Okay.

574
00:40:08,364 --> 00:40:09,740
Right, Ms. Oh.

575
00:40:10,408 --> 00:40:13,702
Which snack is your favorite?

576
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:15,830
My favorite?

577
00:40:18,833 --> 00:40:23,087
I like the diet bars that our team made

578
00:40:23,170 --> 00:40:25,423
two years ago.

579
00:40:26,215 --> 00:40:29,635
Not only are they tasty,
but they're nutritious as well.

580
00:40:29,718 --> 00:40:31,095
Judging by

581
00:40:31,178 --> 00:40:34,265
the constant sales volume,
they meet the market's needs.

582
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,851
Yes, that's a good product.

583
00:40:38,227 --> 00:40:39,645
-You may go.
-Okay.

584
00:40:42,231 --> 00:40:46,152
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-MAN

585
00:40:56,245 --> 00:40:59,582
JOA CORN

586
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,724
Are you trying to comfort me?

587
00:41:29,153 --> 00:41:30,404
It's sweet.

588
00:41:33,073 --> 00:41:34,074
It's tasty.

589
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:43,626
I'm sure your mom went to a good place.

590
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,883
Especially the snacks my dad used to buy

591
00:41:50,966 --> 00:41:53,469
on his way home
from work to make me feel better

592
00:41:54,595 --> 00:41:56,180
were the tastiest.

593
00:41:57,806 --> 00:42:00,684
That's why even to this day,
I become happy

594
00:42:01,977 --> 00:42:03,646
whenever I eat snacks.

595
00:42:06,982 --> 00:42:08,692
Snacks that make you happy…

596
00:42:12,738 --> 00:42:14,365
Call Mr. Kim to my office.

597
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:20,496
WHY SHOULD I BE FIRED?

598
00:42:22,456 --> 00:42:23,666
Ms. Bahn.

599
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:28,003
-Yes?
-You should stop doing this.

600
00:42:29,588 --> 00:42:30,548
I'm sorry.

601
00:42:31,090 --> 00:42:34,510
But I need to tell others
about the unfair treatment I got.

602
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:38,097
That's not it.
You can go back to work starting Monday.

603
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,142
Really?

604
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:44,853
Are you saying I can go back to the mart?

605
00:42:44,937 --> 00:42:48,482
No. You will be working
at the Joa Confectionery headquarters.

606
00:42:52,736 --> 00:42:53,988
What?

607
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,116
What's going on?

608
00:42:59,201 --> 00:43:02,329
I'll be going back to work
starting Monday.

609
00:43:03,247 --> 00:43:04,081
What?

610
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:07,251
What?

611
00:43:15,009 --> 00:43:16,302
One hundred and eleven.

612
00:43:17,469 --> 00:43:18,762
One hundred and twelve.

613
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:22,391
One hundred and thirteen.

614
00:43:22,474 --> 00:43:23,934
Anthony.

615
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:27,187
I'm dying here.
Please show me mercy just once, please?

616
00:43:27,271 --> 00:43:29,607
Is someone threatening you?

617
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,152
I'm just trying
to help you get a good body.

618
00:43:33,444 --> 00:43:34,987
Men should have strong thighs.

619
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,238
Do 5,000 reps.

620
00:43:36,322 --> 00:43:38,365
I won't do that ever again.

621
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,783
Please forgive me.

622
00:43:39,867 --> 00:43:41,910
You did nothing wrong.

623
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,662
It's me who has a bad reputation.

624
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:45,873
Go on.

625
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:56,050
Anthony.

626
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:56,967
Yes?

627
00:43:58,802 --> 00:44:00,721
I have to run something by you.

628
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:03,891
You're too good looking

629
00:44:03,974 --> 00:44:07,770
to do a commercial for a snack, right?

630
00:44:07,853 --> 00:44:08,854
Isn't that obvious?

631
00:44:08,937 --> 00:44:11,023
JOA CONFECTIONERY
ADVERTISEMENT CONTRACT

632
00:44:11,106 --> 00:44:13,692
But don't actors these days

633
00:44:13,776 --> 00:44:16,195
try different things
to change their image?

634
00:44:16,278 --> 00:44:18,697
I said I'm not doing
that Joa Confectionary ad.

635
00:44:24,953 --> 00:44:27,539
Darn it. I need to save money,

636
00:44:28,207 --> 00:44:30,167
but I can't quit coffee cold turkey.

637
00:45:34,773 --> 00:45:36,066
Who are you?

638
00:45:37,693 --> 00:45:39,361
CHA SEUNG-SEOK
JOA CONFECTIONERY

639
00:45:44,158 --> 00:45:47,661
So Ms. Han told you to tail me?

640
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:49,288
Yes.

641
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:51,623
Gosh, she needs to stop worrying about me.

642
00:45:52,666 --> 00:45:53,625
Hold on.

643
00:45:54,752 --> 00:45:57,588
Are my dad and aunt both in on this?

644
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:00,048
I'm not sure about that.

645
00:46:00,132 --> 00:46:01,216
You little…

646
00:46:01,717 --> 00:46:03,427
This is a warning.

647
00:46:03,510 --> 00:46:05,637
You're dead meat if I ever see you again.

648
00:46:05,721 --> 00:46:07,389
I'll get scolded by Ms. Han.

649
00:46:07,473 --> 00:46:08,974
I don't care!

650
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,645
No.

651
00:46:14,480 --> 00:46:18,317
Hey. I think I could actually
make good use of you.

652
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,154
-Sorry?
-You better choose your side.

653
00:46:22,237 --> 00:46:24,948
Is it them or me? Be wise.

654
00:46:26,784 --> 00:46:29,244
-Well--
-What's there to ponder about?

655
00:46:30,287 --> 00:46:34,374
Whose do you think is nastier?
Me or my aunt?

656
00:46:39,338 --> 00:46:42,007
-I'll side with you, young master.
-Good thinking.

657
00:46:43,008 --> 00:46:46,637
-Don't call me that. It's old-fashioned.
-Then how should I address you?

658
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,517
-"Sir" will suffice.
-Yes, sir.

659
00:47:05,781 --> 00:47:07,324
Shall we clink our glasses?

660
00:47:08,534 --> 00:47:10,619
Pour me a glass of that too.

661
00:47:10,702 --> 00:47:12,329
You're too young to drink.

662
00:47:13,413 --> 00:47:14,748
You're still a student.

663
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:17,584
Are you scolding me?

664
00:47:18,168 --> 00:47:20,254
When I helped you get your job back?

665
00:47:21,713 --> 00:47:25,008
Have them before they get burnt.
You don't like them well done.

666
00:47:25,425 --> 00:47:26,760
How did you…

667
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:29,346
Right. Of course, you'd know that.

668
00:47:30,055 --> 00:47:32,307
I keep forgetting that you're me.

669
00:47:32,391 --> 00:47:33,475
Me too.

670
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,727
Ma'am.

671
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:38,146
-May we have gochujang…
-Instead of ssamjang?

672
00:47:42,985 --> 00:47:44,486
Thank you.

673
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:51,034
Tell me the truth.

674
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,203
You're happy I'm here, right?

675
00:47:53,287 --> 00:47:55,038
-What do you think?
-You're not?

676
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,707
I'm not sure.

677
00:47:57,583 --> 00:47:58,625
Still…

678
00:47:59,543 --> 00:48:02,087
-I can agree with this one thing.
-What?

679
00:48:03,088 --> 00:48:05,674
That "joy is doubled when shared."

680
00:48:07,175 --> 00:48:09,761
Just double?
It should be at least tenfold.

681
00:48:10,846 --> 00:48:14,683
Fine. I like the sound of that.
Let's say it's tenfold.

682
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,980
Wait!
We haven't clinked our glasses just yet.

683
00:48:21,273 --> 00:48:22,107
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

684
00:48:33,243 --> 00:48:34,536
No, something else.

685
00:48:47,174 --> 00:48:48,675
Doesn't this one look okay?

686
00:48:49,217 --> 00:48:50,636
-You…
-Next.

687
00:48:58,310 --> 00:48:59,686
It doesn't look bad,

688
00:49:01,063 --> 00:49:02,356
but it looks too average.

689
00:49:02,439 --> 00:49:06,026
It's my first day at work.
I shouldn't stand out.

690
00:49:06,693 --> 00:49:10,405
Bahn Ha-ni and "standing out"
goes hand in hand.

691
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,532
And why are you only wearing pants?

692
00:49:13,784 --> 00:49:16,745
What about those tight skirts
that office ladies wear?

693
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:18,580
With tanned stockings.

694
00:49:19,498 --> 00:49:20,540
I don't wear skirts.

695
00:49:21,458 --> 00:49:24,002
Why not? I love short skirts.

696
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,296
I gained a bit of weight.

697
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:30,467
Let's pick one from the ones I wore.

698
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:32,469
I'll go get changed.

699
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:37,057
You should've been strict
with what you ate on a regular basis.

700
00:49:49,903 --> 00:49:51,029
Ha-ni!

701
00:50:08,714 --> 00:50:10,424
Let's see how fat you've…

702
00:50:15,303 --> 00:50:17,764
What happened to your leg?

703
00:50:18,765 --> 00:50:19,891
Close the door.

704
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:45,917
What do you think?

705
00:50:46,835 --> 00:50:49,421
Her condition hasn't worsened.

706
00:50:49,504 --> 00:50:50,881
I see no big difference.

707
00:50:52,090 --> 00:50:54,885
Then why does Mom say Grandma
talks nonsense nowadays?

708
00:50:59,014 --> 00:51:00,057
What did she say?

709
00:51:00,140 --> 00:51:02,267
Her condition hasn't worsened.

710
00:51:02,350 --> 00:51:04,936
It could be temporary,
so don't worry too much.

711
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:07,647
I'm glad.

712
00:51:09,274 --> 00:51:12,360
We'll go back to Daejeon then.

713
00:51:12,444 --> 00:51:14,696
We should eat.
I hadn't seen you in a while.

714
00:51:16,114 --> 00:51:18,950
Then instead of spending money
at a restaurant,

715
00:51:19,034 --> 00:51:20,619
let's eat at your place.

716
00:51:20,702 --> 00:51:22,412
Ha-ni must be home too.

717
00:51:23,997 --> 00:51:26,917
She left home, Mom.

718
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:29,044
What do you mean? To where?

719
00:51:30,337 --> 00:51:32,672
-She moved out.
-What?

720
00:51:34,299 --> 00:51:37,219
It's nothing. Go back to sleep.

721
00:51:48,063 --> 00:51:50,440
Did you injure your leg?

722
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,194
-Yes.
-What happened?

723
00:51:55,862 --> 00:51:58,990
I was reckless and refused
to listen to my parents.

724
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:01,034
When did that happen?

725
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:13,296
You told me not to run away, right?

726
00:52:15,966 --> 00:52:17,342
Once you return,

727
00:52:19,094 --> 00:52:22,472
don't you forget what you said, Ha-ni.

728
00:52:35,110 --> 00:52:36,278
MOM

729
00:52:36,361 --> 00:52:37,237
It's Mom.

730
00:52:38,238 --> 00:52:39,489
Mom's calling.

731
00:52:42,117 --> 00:52:44,411
-Give it to me.
-No! I want to answer it!

732
00:52:44,494 --> 00:52:46,663
Hey, Ha-ni!

733
00:52:50,083 --> 00:52:52,002
-Hello? Ha-ni.
-Hey, Mom.

734
00:52:53,253 --> 00:52:54,212
It's Mom.

735
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,717
I heard you moved out.

736
00:52:59,593 --> 00:53:02,262
My workplace was too far from there.

737
00:53:03,847 --> 00:53:06,099
Where is your house?

738
00:53:06,183 --> 00:53:07,142
In Shinjae-dong.

739
00:53:07,642 --> 00:53:09,769
Thank goodness it's nearby.

740
00:53:10,353 --> 00:53:13,106
Tell me the address. Let me stop by.

741
00:53:13,190 --> 00:53:14,149
What?

742
00:53:14,232 --> 00:53:17,194
I had to visit the hospital in a hurry
because of Grandma.

743
00:53:17,277 --> 00:53:19,070
We're about to go back home.

744
00:53:19,154 --> 00:53:20,322
No.

745
00:53:20,405 --> 00:53:22,991
I'll call you again
after I finish unpacking.

746
00:53:23,074 --> 00:53:25,535
It won't take long. Tell me your address.

747
00:53:25,619 --> 00:53:27,621
-Hurry.
-I love you, Mom!

748
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,376
What did you just say?

749
00:53:34,419 --> 00:53:37,797
Nothing. I'll text you my address.

750
00:53:53,480 --> 00:53:57,442
Was it that wrong of me
to say that I love her?

751
00:53:57,525 --> 00:53:59,152
Why did you panic?

752
00:54:01,446 --> 00:54:03,114
She'd think it's odd.

753
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:04,282
Why would she?

754
00:54:04,866 --> 00:54:08,703
I always told my family that I loved them.

755
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:12,666
People rarely say that once they grow up.

756
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:15,961
MOM

757
00:54:17,212 --> 00:54:20,131
You better stay put.

758
00:54:28,431 --> 00:54:30,892
Why are you outside? I could've come in.

759
00:54:30,976 --> 00:54:34,729
It's a rooftop. The stairs are steep.
It's dangerous.

760
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:37,983
It's not like you live on the rooftop
of a skyscraper.

761
00:54:38,900 --> 00:54:40,402
Where do you live?

762
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:41,736
You can't come.

763
00:54:41,820 --> 00:54:44,990
I haven't unpacked yet. It's still a mess.

764
00:54:45,073 --> 00:54:46,449
Next time.

765
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:48,535
And Grandma's here too.

766
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:51,830
-Mother, what are you doing?
-You wench!

767
00:54:51,913 --> 00:54:54,666
You wench. You little witch.

768
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,960
-Goodness.
-You witch.

769
00:54:57,043 --> 00:54:59,713
-Mother!
-I will kill you.

770
00:54:59,796 --> 00:55:01,256
-Goodness!
-You…

771
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,925
You wench.

772
00:55:04,009 --> 00:55:06,761
-Mother, please!
-You're dead meat!

773
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:08,847
Goodness! Why are you so strong?

774
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,349
Please stop, Mother!

775
00:55:11,433 --> 00:55:13,643
-Please, Mother!
-You wench.

776
00:55:26,740 --> 00:55:29,868
Why have Mom and Grandma aged so much?

777
00:55:32,787 --> 00:55:35,582
Don't tell me you saw everything.

778
00:55:36,750 --> 00:55:38,376
They could've seen you.

779
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,670
That's why I was hiding.

780
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:44,674
But Mom had so many wrinkles

781
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:46,384
and her hair turned white.

782
00:55:47,552 --> 00:55:49,304
Twenty years have passed.

783
00:55:49,387 --> 00:55:50,972
It's natural.

784
00:55:55,268 --> 00:55:57,645
And why was Grandma treating you that way?

785
00:55:59,022 --> 00:56:00,690
She cherished me the most.

786
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,364
Grandma…

787
00:56:11,326 --> 00:56:12,327
has dementia.

788
00:56:13,828 --> 00:56:14,996
She does?

789
00:56:16,331 --> 00:56:20,043
The great Ms. Lee Hong-nyeon is demented?

790
00:56:28,718 --> 00:56:29,928
Grandma!

791
00:56:31,763 --> 00:56:34,432
Goodness, my little puppy.

792
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:36,267
-How was school?
-Good.

793
00:56:36,351 --> 00:56:37,936
Did you go on a date today?

794
00:56:38,019 --> 00:56:40,397
-What?
-Why are you all dressed up?

795
00:56:41,398 --> 00:56:44,567
I got this made by a dressmaker.
How does it look?

796
00:56:44,651 --> 00:56:47,695
Totally.
From behind, you look like a young lady.

797
00:56:47,779 --> 00:56:51,199
Goodness. Look at you being all foxy

798
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:53,576
and sugarcoating your words.

799
00:56:53,660 --> 00:56:56,788
You're the spitting image of me
when I was your age.

800
00:56:56,871 --> 00:56:59,499
You bet.
I'm your granddaughter, after all.

801
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:01,418
Of course, I take after you.

802
00:57:23,898 --> 00:57:25,233
When you go back,

803
00:57:28,987 --> 00:57:30,155
tell her

804
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:35,160
that you love her every single day.

805
00:57:36,953 --> 00:57:40,081
Tell her that I love her so much…

806
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,210
and that I'm sorry.

807
00:58:14,282 --> 00:58:16,242
She must be disappointed.

808
00:58:16,784 --> 00:58:18,786
Good morning, guys!

809
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:28,588
Good morning.

810
00:58:31,007 --> 00:58:32,717
What? What's going on?

811
00:58:33,801 --> 00:58:35,512
A rumor has been going around.

812
00:58:36,095 --> 00:58:37,472
A rumor?

813
00:58:37,555 --> 00:58:41,059
Our chairman has committed nepotism.

814
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:46,189
That has never happened before.

815
00:58:46,272 --> 00:58:48,066
What's even more shocking

816
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:51,277
is that Ms. Oh wasn't aware of this.

817
00:58:52,570 --> 00:58:55,698
She's totally shook up
after learning about it this morning.

818
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,202
So that's why she looks so downcast.

819
00:59:03,706 --> 00:59:06,167
I'm sure you had your reasons

820
00:59:06,251 --> 00:59:07,961
about hiring this new employee.

821
00:59:08,878 --> 00:59:11,673
But you could've told Ms. Oh in advance.

822
00:59:11,756 --> 00:59:13,132
It's the "catfish effect".

823
00:59:14,425 --> 00:59:16,177
Having a new rival

824
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:19,639
brings up the other employees' potential.

825
00:59:21,266 --> 00:59:25,812
But I doubt a mere contract worker
would do such a thing.

826
00:59:25,895 --> 00:59:27,897
You could be right.

827
00:59:29,941 --> 00:59:35,613
If that contract worker isn't a catfish
like I had previously thought…

828
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:45,665
she'd just become their prey.

829
00:59:47,959 --> 00:59:49,210
You can do it,

830
00:59:50,962 --> 00:59:52,046
Bahn Ha-ni.

831
00:59:59,971 --> 01:00:02,515
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT TEAM TEAM LEADER
OH JI-EUN

832
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:04,892
SECTION CHIEF
GO JEONG-DO

833
01:00:04,976 --> 01:00:06,686
By the way,

834
01:00:08,104 --> 01:00:11,232
why is the chairman's favorite
still not here?

835
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:14,861
Beats me. I doubt she'd be late
on her first day at work.

836
01:00:16,571 --> 01:00:18,698
Maybe it was a fake rumor.

837
01:00:35,798 --> 01:00:38,426
I'm sorry for being late.

838
01:00:39,469 --> 01:00:44,515
I'm Bahn Ha-ni, your new teammate.

839
01:01:00,406 --> 01:01:01,532
"Bahn Ha-ni"?

840
01:01:15,004 --> 01:01:16,923
SPECIAL THANKS TO JIN HEE-KYUNG

841
01:01:47,245 --> 01:01:49,580
-It really must be fate.
-It's a coincidence.

842
01:01:49,664 --> 01:01:50,707
No!

843
01:01:50,790 --> 01:01:53,084
-Are you okay?
-No. We're ill-fated.

844
01:01:53,167 --> 01:01:55,169
You only started this because of a girl,

845
01:01:55,294 --> 01:01:56,754
so why are you so attached?

846
01:01:56,838 --> 01:01:58,506
You've changed a lot.

847
01:01:58,589 --> 01:02:00,925
You were the Lee Hyo-ri
of our high school.

848
01:02:01,008 --> 01:02:04,137
This isn't a photoshoot.
It's an ad for Joa Confectionary.

849
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:05,304
Holy crap.

850
01:02:06,472 --> 01:02:08,975
What kind of Superman cries so sadly?

851
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:12,520
Hey! When you're down,
have this and cheer up!

852
01:02:14,105 --> 01:02:18,151
