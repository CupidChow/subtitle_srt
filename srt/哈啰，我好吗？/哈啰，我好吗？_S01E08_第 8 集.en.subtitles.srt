00:00:52,886 --> 00:00:53,928
EPISODE 8

2
00:00:54,012 --> 00:00:55,013
Ms. Oh.

3
00:00:57,807 --> 00:00:58,767
Yes?

4
00:00:59,768 --> 00:01:02,353
I want to do it.

5
00:01:03,146 --> 00:01:06,191
-Do what?
-You told me

6
00:01:06,274 --> 00:01:09,235
to prove to you that I'm someone

7
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:11,571
this team needs.

8
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,491
-So?
-I'd like to compete

9
00:01:15,825 --> 00:01:17,285
in the contest.

10
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:26,294
I'll do my best.

11
00:01:27,712 --> 00:01:30,632
So if I end up doing a good enough job,

12
00:01:30,715 --> 00:01:34,594
I'd like for you to acknowledge me
as a member of your team.

13
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,642
Sure.

14
00:01:41,935 --> 00:01:44,479
I'll look forward to some good news.

15
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,566
Sure.

16
00:01:49,984 --> 00:01:51,319
I'll do my best.

17
00:01:52,111 --> 00:01:55,115
-Hanwoo.
-Galbi.

18
00:01:55,198 --> 00:01:56,866
-Hanwoo.
-Galbi.

19
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,409
-We've got this.
-Hanwoo Galbi!

20
00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:00,578
-We can do this.
-Yes, we can!

21
00:02:03,832 --> 00:02:06,626
Ladies, we're teammates now,
so let's work hard.

22
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:11,339
I'll get going then. See you tomorrow.

23
00:02:13,716 --> 00:02:14,551
Bye!

24
00:02:16,052 --> 00:02:17,178
Bye.

25
00:02:17,262 --> 00:02:18,888
-Bye!
-Bye.

26
00:02:20,682 --> 00:02:22,851
Just you wait, evil old man!

27
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:24,018
Take care.

28
00:02:28,231 --> 00:02:29,274
You know,

29
00:02:30,024 --> 00:02:32,277
I get how he asked us to team up with him,

30
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,362
but why are we called Hanwoo Galbi?

31
00:02:34,445 --> 00:02:35,405
Well…

32
00:02:36,072 --> 00:02:39,242
I guess he wants to have his fill
of ribs with the prize money.

33
00:02:39,325 --> 00:02:40,952
Seriously?

34
00:02:41,494 --> 00:02:44,122
I'd gladly buy him some if he asks.

35
00:02:45,415 --> 00:02:46,416
Why would you?

36
00:02:46,499 --> 00:02:48,668
How about a round of drinks?

37
00:02:48,751 --> 00:02:50,044
-Just for an hour.
-Come on.

38
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:52,172
-We'll get drunk fast.
-Just go home.

39
00:02:52,255 --> 00:02:55,383
-No, this is a night to enjoy drinks.
-Come on.

40
00:03:00,805 --> 00:03:02,265
JOA CONFECTIONERY

41
00:03:27,707 --> 00:03:29,167
Have you had dinner yet?

42
00:03:34,464 --> 00:03:35,548
Here you go.

43
00:03:41,804 --> 00:03:43,348
I figured my recipes

44
00:03:44,349 --> 00:03:47,518
were at least worth beef instead of pork.

45
00:03:48,645 --> 00:03:51,731
I'll treat you to something nicer
once I receive my salary.

46
00:03:52,315 --> 00:03:55,360
Should we order some rice
and doenjang stew?

47
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,488
No. I'm filling my stomach
with meat today.

48
00:03:59,489 --> 00:04:03,284
Anyway, you never offered to buy me dinner
no matter how much I begged you to,

49
00:04:03,952 --> 00:04:05,328
so what gives?

50
00:04:06,621 --> 00:04:10,083
Yesterday, you suggested that
we enter the contest together.

51
00:04:10,166 --> 00:04:11,042
Right.

52
00:04:11,709 --> 00:04:13,753
Let's do it together.

53
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,507
-What?
-You're a wonderful cook

54
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:18,841
and have many certificates.

55
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,635
Work with me on this.

56
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:25,056
Hold on a second.

57
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:32,522
Yu-hyeon declined,

58
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,024
so what other choice do I have?

59
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,027
Anthony.

60
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,571
Anthony.

61
00:04:46,619 --> 00:04:49,372
He was a useless prick anyway,

62
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,999
so this is for the best.

63
00:04:52,166 --> 00:04:54,043
Since we're in this together,

64
00:04:55,044 --> 00:04:59,549
how about a quick smooch?
No, wait. A kiss.

65
00:05:01,259 --> 00:05:03,678
Come on. You're embarrassing me.

66
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:07,765
I'm embarrassed too.

67
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:09,475
So kiss me.

68
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:24,407
No!

69
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,327
No?

70
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,829
No. Hold on.

71
00:05:38,546 --> 00:05:41,841
Due to personal reasons,
team Hanwoo Galbi has been disbanded.

72
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,634
Take care, everyone.

73
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:47,263
WILL YOU LEAVE THE CHAT ROOM?

74
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:54,854
When it comes to meat, pork is the best.

75
00:05:57,398 --> 00:05:58,316
What?

76
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:01,527
Count me in. The contest, I mean.

77
00:06:11,204 --> 00:06:14,332
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-MAN

78
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:16,959
Ji-suk, I know what's worrying you.

79
00:06:18,127 --> 00:06:21,089
However, it's also our job

80
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:25,259
to carry on the corporate philosophy of
Joa Confectionery that our father left us.

81
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,553
So let's put our faith
in Ji-eun this time.

82
00:06:27,637 --> 00:06:28,805
Well…

83
00:06:30,014 --> 00:06:31,099
You're right.

84
00:06:31,933 --> 00:06:35,686
Come to think of it,
I think Ji-eun's right.

85
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:38,898
Sales and profit aren't everything.

86
00:06:40,149 --> 00:06:44,904
It's also about time for us
to make room for the new generation.

87
00:06:44,987 --> 00:06:48,116
Leave me out of it, will you?
I'm not that old.

88
00:07:01,629 --> 00:07:05,341
You've worked hard over the years too.

89
00:07:05,424 --> 00:07:07,718
It's time you took a break as well.

90
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:14,308
You're right. And I'll be able to
thanks to how great they're doing.

91
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:26,237
Where on your face though?
There's nothing more to shave down.

92
00:07:26,320 --> 00:07:28,698
Could my bone
be growing back or something?

93
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,950
You must be chewing only on this side.

94
00:07:31,033 --> 00:07:32,827
This came for you.

95
00:07:33,411 --> 00:07:35,455
RECIPIENT: ANTHONY

96
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:36,497
SENDER: BAHN HA-NI

97
00:07:37,081 --> 00:07:39,459
-Bahn Ha-ni?
-Wait a second.

98
00:07:40,168 --> 00:07:41,794
Did she send this?

99
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:50,720
Unbelievable. She ripped them into pieces.

100
00:07:52,221 --> 00:07:55,183
Then the issue is solved, right?

101
00:07:59,479 --> 00:08:03,483
Who is she to tell me
that I became a loser?

102
00:08:03,566 --> 00:08:07,236
How dare she say that
to the greatest star in the universe!

103
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,696
As if she's any better.

104
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:11,282
Says the tramp who had a kid so young.

105
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:12,450
Exactly.

106
00:08:12,533 --> 00:08:14,869
The Lee Hyo-ri of Hosu High
is now just an old hag.

107
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,372
She doesn't look that bad, you know.

108
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,208
Do you know how popular she was?

109
00:08:20,291 --> 00:08:22,126
Someone like you
wouldn't have had a chance.

110
00:08:22,210 --> 00:08:24,337
People would've slapped you for trying.

111
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:26,172
I was only siding with you.

112
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:28,174
I never asked you to.

113
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:30,009
Hey! I completed a piece.

114
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,137
It's not a puzzle for you to match.

115
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,722
I'm sorry.

116
00:08:36,057 --> 00:08:39,977
Those who are supposed to be my family
are of no help at all.

117
00:08:41,270 --> 00:08:43,940
By the way,
have you heard back from Ms. Kim?

118
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,568
Not yet, but the other actors
have been talking to the press.

119
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:52,031
Really? Then, we should do that too.

120
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,700
There's nothing
to write articles about though.

121
00:08:54,784 --> 00:08:55,618
Damn it!

122
00:08:59,038 --> 00:09:00,164
Mr. Park.

123
00:09:01,749 --> 00:09:06,295
You can just copy
what the others have been saying.

124
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,923
-Sure thing.
-Mr. Park!

125
00:09:09,006 --> 00:09:11,092
-Got it.
-You're killing me.

126
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,346
Anthony.

127
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:18,891
You're trending online at the moment.

128
00:09:18,975 --> 00:09:21,519
Maybe this will make you popular again.

129
00:09:22,228 --> 00:09:24,272
That's out of the blue. What's up?

130
00:09:24,855 --> 00:09:26,524
Hold on. Let me check.

131
00:09:26,607 --> 00:09:29,318
Mr. Park, something doesn't seem right.

132
00:09:33,531 --> 00:09:34,991
Hey, wait.

133
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,870
What on earth did you post
on your SNS page?

134
00:09:39,954 --> 00:09:41,163
Nothing.

135
00:09:42,832 --> 00:09:47,503
The main character in Ms. Kim's
new drama series is a chef,

136
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:51,507
so I posted a photo of me
with the food I had delivered last night.

137
00:09:53,009 --> 00:09:55,469
That must be
what the reporters wrote about.

138
00:09:57,430 --> 00:10:00,933
This is the life of a "celubrity."
Wait. Is it "celebrity"?

139
00:10:01,017 --> 00:10:03,311
Anyway, this is the life
of a top celebrity.

140
00:10:03,394 --> 00:10:05,563
"Groping a watermelon."

141
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:07,773
"Seedy progress."

142
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:10,860
"Foot fetish."

143
00:10:12,695 --> 00:10:16,198
Not one word was written correctly.

144
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,036
-Not even one.
-What do you mean?

145
00:10:20,661 --> 00:10:24,874
Mr. Park, you're aware
that Anthony lived in the US.

146
00:10:25,541 --> 00:10:27,793
I agree it was too much, but…

147
00:10:27,877 --> 00:10:31,005
I booked a nice Japanese restaurant,
so why don't we--

148
00:10:31,088 --> 00:10:33,257
Who do they think they are?
Sejong the Great?

149
00:10:33,341 --> 00:10:35,343
It's not like they never make mistakes.

150
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:37,303
-Just to drag me through the mud…
-Sure.

151
00:10:37,386 --> 00:10:39,513
-I'd appreciate it if you did that.
-Damn it.

152
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:41,766
Sure thing. All right.

153
00:10:44,644 --> 00:10:45,728
Damn it.

154
00:10:45,811 --> 00:10:50,274
How is it that nothing
ever works out these days?

155
00:10:51,108 --> 00:10:54,487
Mr. Park. I don't think this will do.

156
00:10:54,570 --> 00:10:56,530
We should give them
something else to gossip about.

157
00:10:56,614 --> 00:10:58,407
Do you have any other ideas?

158
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:00,868
I suggested this last time,

159
00:11:00,951 --> 00:11:04,246
but how about volunteering
at an animal shelter with his haters?

160
00:11:04,330 --> 00:11:05,956
I already put together a list.

161
00:11:07,083 --> 00:11:08,626
That doesn't sound so bad.

162
00:11:08,709 --> 00:11:11,337
Volunteer work helps reshape your image.

163
00:11:11,420 --> 00:11:12,338
What do you think?

164
00:11:12,922 --> 00:11:15,675
Gather everyone who left
hateful comments about me tomorrow.

165
00:11:15,758 --> 00:11:17,385
Would they show up though?

166
00:11:17,468 --> 00:11:20,429
We included volunteer work
within the settlement.

167
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:22,306
-Did we?
-Did we?

168
00:11:22,390 --> 00:11:26,185
-We did.
-Also, call that loser Bahn Ha-ni too.

169
00:11:26,268 --> 00:11:29,021
Tell her I'll sue her for violating
our terms if she refuses.

170
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,731
You know what? Just sue her.

171
00:11:42,618 --> 00:11:43,661
What is it?

172
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,372
Do I have something on my face?

173
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,082
No.

174
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:51,001
-Can I ask you something?
-What?

175
00:11:52,086 --> 00:11:55,131
What's your relationship
with that Anthony guy?

176
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:59,677
We just went to the same high school.

177
00:12:00,428 --> 00:12:03,639
I know you lived a promiscuous life,

178
00:12:05,307 --> 00:12:07,309
but why did you kiss
your high school friend?

179
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,438
Sorry?

180
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:12,690
What do you mean?

181
00:12:12,773 --> 00:12:14,859
I ran into him

182
00:12:16,026 --> 00:12:18,195
-and he said you two kissed.
-He must be insane!

183
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:20,448
That never happened!

184
00:12:21,073 --> 00:12:22,032
What happened was…

185
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,286
We fell and our lips touched.

186
00:12:27,538 --> 00:12:28,998
-Is that so?
-Yes.

187
00:12:29,081 --> 00:12:31,542
It's actually the worst memory I have.

188
00:12:33,043 --> 00:12:36,255
Then he must have lied just to show off.

189
00:12:36,338 --> 00:12:38,382
-What a coward.
-Chun-sik said that?

190
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:41,427
Is Chun-sik his name?

191
00:12:41,510 --> 00:12:42,803
Yes, Yang Chun-sik.

192
00:12:42,887 --> 00:12:45,222
That's one tacky name.

193
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:50,853
He doesn't seem to like
his past being mentioned,

194
00:12:50,936 --> 00:12:52,521
so just pretend you don't know.

195
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:53,689
I'll think about it.

196
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:06,452
Well, this is me.

197
00:13:06,535 --> 00:13:07,495
Sure.

198
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:13,918
-What's this?
-Well…

199
00:13:14,001 --> 00:13:16,504
we're teammates now, so let's shake on it.

200
00:13:23,344 --> 00:13:25,304
You've got to be kidding me.

201
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:31,519
I'll get going then.

202
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:32,520
Sure.

203
00:13:39,777 --> 00:13:41,237
The old lady's hand…

204
00:13:42,988 --> 00:13:44,240
is so tiny.

205
00:13:54,500 --> 00:13:55,918
What's up with you?

206
00:13:56,502 --> 00:14:00,589
-Have you been secretly dating him?
-Date him? Of course not.

207
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,216
Why were you holding hands?

208
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:04,760
What you saw was a handshake…

209
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:06,720
between two teammates.

210
00:14:07,429 --> 00:14:08,264
Teammates?

211
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,309
We're working on a project
together at work.

212
00:14:14,728 --> 00:14:15,938
-Really?
-Yes.

213
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:24,154
It must be true
since you haven't blinked twice.

214
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,449
This will strictly be business.

215
00:14:27,533 --> 00:14:28,826
Don't you dare date him.

216
00:14:28,909 --> 00:14:30,578
I told you not to worry.

217
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,252
Hold on. Did you have barbecue with him?

218
00:14:39,628 --> 00:14:43,424
Sorry. I owed him, you see.

219
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,551
While I was here eating ramyeon?

220
00:14:45,634 --> 00:14:47,845
I can't believe you could stomach that.

221
00:14:47,928 --> 00:14:52,391
It's my day off tomorrow,
so I thought I'd take you out.

222
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,644
Tomorrow?

223
00:14:56,687 --> 00:14:58,022
And go where?

224
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:05,863
My son, where are you off to
so early in the morning?

225
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:09,950
The book store to get some books I need.

226
00:15:10,034 --> 00:15:12,536
Why don't I pick them up
on my way home from work?

227
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:16,457
It's all right. I need them right away,
so I'll get them myself.

228
00:15:29,136 --> 00:15:30,554
My son.

229
00:15:31,847 --> 00:15:33,682
What have you been studying lately?

230
00:15:44,068 --> 00:15:46,445
Where are we going
that you want me dressed casually?

231
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:49,198
Someplace you love.

232
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,240
Place that I love?

233
00:15:56,622 --> 00:15:58,540
Ta-da!

234
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:04,254
This is so cool!

235
00:16:04,338 --> 00:16:06,757
Ours is right up there.

236
00:16:06,840 --> 00:16:07,841
Follow me.

237
00:16:11,428 --> 00:16:12,429
Ta-da.

238
00:16:13,263 --> 00:16:14,515
A trampoline!

239
00:16:25,901 --> 00:16:28,320
I haven't done this in a while, you know.

240
00:16:32,241 --> 00:16:34,410
Bahn Ha-ni!

241
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:47,589
Do you have money for this though?

242
00:16:48,465 --> 00:16:50,509
You said cellphones cost
over a million won.

243
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,469
It'll be on a 36-month installment plan.

244
00:16:53,262 --> 00:16:56,181
Before you leave for your own timeline,

245
00:16:56,265 --> 00:16:58,600
make sure to give it back
so that I can use it.

246
00:16:58,684 --> 00:17:01,979
Gosh. I wanted to show it off
to my friends though.

247
00:17:02,062 --> 00:17:03,355
You can take mine instead.

248
00:17:03,439 --> 00:17:06,525
But yours isn't the latest model.

249
00:17:06,608 --> 00:17:10,404
Back where you come from,
it'll be as good as new.

250
00:17:10,487 --> 00:17:12,573
You couldn't take photos
with phones back then.

251
00:17:13,782 --> 00:17:14,783
You're right.

252
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:18,454
Then I'll give it to you
as a goodbye present.

253
00:17:23,250 --> 00:17:24,793
I'm the one paying for it.

254
00:17:36,388 --> 00:17:40,225
I can't believe I got a cell phone today.
Gosh, I'm so happy.

255
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:44,063
Me too. I had to spend some money,
but it still feels great.

256
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:49,401
But you suddenly bought me a cell phone.

257
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:50,944
Why are you being so nice?

258
00:17:52,863 --> 00:17:56,658
-Let's just say I'm bribing you.
-"A bribe"?

259
00:17:57,284 --> 00:18:00,329
Blue Bird and I decided
to enter a contest together

260
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:04,500
to come up with an idea for a new snack.

261
00:18:04,583 --> 00:18:07,711
I see. So that's what you're
working on together?

262
00:18:07,795 --> 00:18:10,714
Yes, exactly.
It'd be great if you could help us out.

263
00:18:11,298 --> 00:18:12,925
You love snacks.

264
00:18:15,302 --> 00:18:16,637
Of course.

265
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:20,808
I know everything about snacks.

266
00:18:24,061 --> 00:18:25,354
Stop it.

267
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:29,399
Hey, did you think you could avoid us
by skipping school?

268
00:18:30,150 --> 00:18:31,527
I'm sorry.

269
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:33,987
That's So-hye.

270
00:18:34,071 --> 00:18:36,824
"So-hye"? Do you know her?

271
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:38,575
She's my friend.

272
00:18:38,659 --> 00:18:41,453
Hey, you don't have any friends here.

273
00:18:41,537 --> 00:18:44,540
We couldn't even go on dates
because we were busy looking for you.

274
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:47,668
How are you going to compensate
for the damage you've caused us?

275
00:18:48,377 --> 00:18:51,255
I can't get you any more money.

276
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:54,049
That's not our problem, is it?

277
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:55,968
Why don't you go steal us some?

278
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:58,554
She's not going to steal anything,
you morons!

279
00:19:00,556 --> 00:19:01,890
Scarlett.

280
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,809
"Scarlett"? Who is she?

281
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,771
Hey, who the hell are you?

282
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:11,984
I'm a girl who's here
to save her friend in the name of justice.

283
00:19:12,067 --> 00:19:14,820
I'm the goddess of Hosu High School.
The most beautiful…

284
00:19:17,072 --> 00:19:18,073
Hey!

285
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:21,118
Are you okay?

286
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:23,036
My gosh. Your nose is bleeding.

287
00:19:23,704 --> 00:19:26,498
Hey! That's cheating!
You can't hit me while I'm talking--

288
00:19:31,962 --> 00:19:36,216
You see, I'm in a very good mood today.

289
00:19:36,842 --> 00:19:40,888
So just leave while I'm being nice.

290
00:19:42,097 --> 00:19:43,515
Whatever, old lady.

291
00:19:43,599 --> 00:19:46,435
Why don't you go do something
about your freckles and wrinkles?

292
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,814
Okay, fine. That's true.

293
00:19:50,898 --> 00:19:53,150
But as old as I am,

294
00:19:54,610 --> 00:19:57,029
I'd appreciate it if you'd just leave

295
00:19:57,112 --> 00:19:59,865
so that I don't lose
my last grasp on sanity.

296
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:01,950
I don't think so.

297
00:20:07,247 --> 00:20:10,834
How dare you!
How dare you kick my chicken?

298
00:20:16,506 --> 00:20:18,008
Bring it on!

299
00:20:21,678 --> 00:20:23,555
Are you okay?

300
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:26,099
My body isn't as nimble as it used to be.

301
00:20:26,808 --> 00:20:28,435
You brats!

302
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,659
You're bleeding from both nostrils.

303
00:20:54,002 --> 00:20:55,629
We meet again, Ms. Bahn.

304
00:20:57,923 --> 00:20:59,341
Why did you fight those kids?

305
00:21:00,050 --> 00:21:01,969
Will you take a look at those girls?

306
00:21:03,553 --> 00:21:04,805
I'm sorry.

307
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,058
They beat us up a lot more.

308
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:12,479
And those girls got together in a group
to gang up on another girl.

309
00:21:12,562 --> 00:21:14,314
They're horrible kids.

310
00:21:15,023 --> 00:21:17,526
Then who beat them up?

311
00:21:23,991 --> 00:21:26,910
An attention seeker and an old lady.

312
00:21:27,869 --> 00:21:29,121
What great friends you have.

313
00:21:34,334 --> 00:21:37,212
Will you please stop?

314
00:21:38,338 --> 00:21:41,174
What? What did you just say?

315
00:21:41,883 --> 00:21:45,053
Stop messing with my friends!

316
00:21:47,097 --> 00:21:48,557
You little brat.

317
00:22:05,532 --> 00:22:06,366
So-hye.

318
00:22:07,951 --> 00:22:10,662
-Dad.
-What happened?

319
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,415
What? Mr. Go.

320
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:23,216
Sorry I scolded you last time.

321
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,136
I was really stressed
because of my daughter.

322
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,181
-I reacted too sensitively.
-No, it's okay.

323
00:22:29,264 --> 00:22:31,058
I was the one who made a mistake.

324
00:22:31,141 --> 00:22:32,976
I'll be more careful from now on.

325
00:22:34,603 --> 00:22:36,855
I thought she was just skipping school.

326
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:40,317
I had no idea she was being bullied.

327
00:22:41,818 --> 00:22:44,029
-Try it.
-It's gross.

328
00:22:44,112 --> 00:22:45,781
It's really delicious.

329
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:47,783
Try a bite. Here.

330
00:22:51,161 --> 00:22:52,746
It bit me.

331
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:56,917
That's how you eat it.

332
00:22:57,501 --> 00:22:59,503
I haven't seen my daughter laugh
in so long.

333
00:23:00,670 --> 00:23:02,047
Thank you for everything.

334
00:23:02,130 --> 00:23:06,093
Thanks to you, I was able to avoid
getting in trouble.

335
00:23:06,176 --> 00:23:07,260
It's nothing.

336
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:11,264
-Let me.
-No, I'll do it. It's okay.

337
00:23:11,348 --> 00:23:15,310
By the way, your daughter is
very bright and pretty.

338
00:23:16,269 --> 00:23:19,564
Gosh, she looks just like you.

339
00:23:22,275 --> 00:23:23,318
Right.

340
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:26,988
-Thank you.
-Sure.

341
00:23:29,866 --> 00:23:31,118
-Bye.
-Did you eat a lot?

342
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,202
Thank you.

343
00:23:32,285 --> 00:23:35,539
Give me that. I'll carry it.

344
00:23:35,622 --> 00:23:36,873
Gosh, it's heavy.

345
00:23:38,458 --> 00:23:40,752
He's just like our dad, isn't he?

346
00:23:43,004 --> 00:23:45,924
-Yes, he is.
-I want to hurry back and see Dad.

347
00:23:48,969 --> 00:23:50,679
I almost forgot.

348
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:54,182
Did you come up with any ideas
for the in-house contest?

349
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,268
No, I'm still thinking about it.

350
00:23:58,061 --> 00:24:01,898
The first snack I made after I entered
Joa Confectionary 20 years ago

351
00:24:02,399 --> 00:24:04,151
is my daughter's favorite snack.

352
00:24:04,234 --> 00:24:05,402
Really?

353
00:24:06,528 --> 00:24:07,529
Is that true?

354
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:10,699
You must be so proud.

355
00:24:10,782 --> 00:24:12,117
Of course.

356
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:14,578
What I meant to say was

357
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:18,790
that you should think about that
before coming up with new ideas.

358
00:24:19,708 --> 00:24:22,669
Think about what your favorite snack was
20 years ago.

359
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:27,424
Then think about what kind of snack
you'd still enjoy after 20 years.

360
00:24:28,633 --> 00:24:30,802
Okay. Thank you, Mr. Go.

361
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,929
-Good luck.
-Got it.

362
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,433
-I'll see you.
-I have a cell phone now,

363
00:24:36,516 --> 00:24:37,809
so I'll call you, So-hye.

364
00:24:38,852 --> 00:24:40,020
-Bye.
-Let's go.

365
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:41,897
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

366
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:49,821
But isn't it weird?

367
00:24:50,363 --> 00:24:52,157
I used to fight really well.

368
00:24:53,867 --> 00:24:58,622
Chun-sik didn't stand a chance against me
even though he was the school bully.

369
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:03,376
-You fool.
-What?

370
00:25:03,460 --> 00:25:06,129
That's because he went easy on you.

371
00:25:07,923 --> 00:25:09,090
You're such a fool.

372
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:12,844
That's not true. And that's mine!

373
00:25:18,099 --> 00:25:22,020
Okay. Now we need to
come up with ideas for the contest,

374
00:25:22,103 --> 00:25:23,605
so think while you eat.

375
00:25:24,564 --> 00:25:26,775
Thanks to you,
I'll get to eat tons of snacks.

376
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:32,155
What was your favorite snack of all time?

377
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,914
Rice Cracker.

378
00:25:41,873 --> 00:25:43,792
The one you always got at Hyeongje Mart?

379
00:25:52,050 --> 00:25:54,594
Forty five, forty six, forty seven,

380
00:25:54,678 --> 00:25:57,430
-forty eight, forty nine, fifty.
-Guys, what are you doing?

381
00:25:57,514 --> 00:26:00,141
We're going for the world record
on touching our heads with our feet.

382
00:26:00,225 --> 00:26:01,851
Just pay for it and go.

383
00:26:01,935 --> 00:26:03,353
-Your foot didn't touch your head.
-It did.

384
00:26:03,436 --> 00:26:04,604
-It didn't.
-It did.

385
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,856
You didn't hear it, but it hit my hair.

386
00:26:06,940 --> 00:26:09,901
You're supposed to hit your head,
not your hair.

387
00:26:09,985 --> 00:26:13,238
You punk.
Then we shouldn't have counted that.

388
00:26:13,321 --> 00:26:15,323
-Sixty one.
-No, it's sixty nine.

389
00:26:15,407 --> 00:26:17,826
We need to leave out the ones
that don't count.

390
00:26:17,909 --> 00:26:19,035
Start from sixty one.

391
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:22,247
Yes, Rice Cracker was really delicious.

392
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:25,125
By the way,

393
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,962
you know those guys at Hyeongje Mart?

394
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:31,548
What do you think they were?

395
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:34,509
Isn't it obvious? They were aliens.

396
00:26:34,592 --> 00:26:36,177
-"Aliens"?
-Yes.

397
00:26:37,012 --> 00:26:38,596
They visited Earth

398
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:41,016
but couldn't get back
because their spaceship broke.

399
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,810
So they kept doing weird stuff

400
00:26:43,893 --> 00:26:45,770
to send signals to outer space.

401
00:26:47,522 --> 00:26:51,401
Yes, I remember. That's what I thought
as I watched The X-Files.

402
00:26:51,484 --> 00:26:53,862
When I first came here,
I went to our neighborhood,

403
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,698
and I noticed that Hyeongje Mart was gone.

404
00:26:56,781 --> 00:26:58,950
-Did you not keep in touch?
-No.

405
00:26:59,993 --> 00:27:02,787
I never heard from them
after I moved to Daejeon.

406
00:27:04,164 --> 00:27:05,457
Just a second.

407
00:27:07,667 --> 00:27:08,501
Hello?

408
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:11,379
Oh, yes.

409
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:13,923
What?

410
00:27:16,301 --> 00:27:19,012
Oh, I see. Okay.

411
00:27:22,390 --> 00:27:24,142
What is it? Did something happen?

412
00:27:33,526 --> 00:27:35,445
Where are we?

413
00:27:36,112 --> 00:27:37,530
You like puppies.

414
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,115
Look. Look at that puppy.

415
00:27:39,199 --> 00:27:41,242
Why are we here?

416
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,829
This is a shelter for abandoned dogs.

417
00:27:47,707 --> 00:27:49,209
We're here to do volunteer work.

418
00:27:50,251 --> 00:27:53,129
I thought you were busy with the contest.

419
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:57,967
-I didn't exactly volunteer.
-Then what?

420
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:04,682
How long have you worked here?

421
00:28:04,766 --> 00:28:06,601
It's been about three years.

422
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,604
It's just a photo
so act like we're in conversation.

423
00:28:09,687 --> 00:28:10,605
Okay.

424
00:28:12,816 --> 00:28:16,611
Gosh, you startled me.
Make it look natural. Stand far away.

425
00:28:16,694 --> 00:28:19,072
People don't like unnatural stuff.
Keep it natural.

426
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,868
Anthony, it's time,
but one person isn't here yet.

427
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:26,246
Who didn't show up on a day like today?

428
00:28:33,420 --> 00:28:35,922
Why did you follow me here?

429
00:28:36,005 --> 00:28:37,382
I didn't follow you here.

430
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:42,429
ANTHONY

431
00:28:43,847 --> 00:28:45,724
I can't believe he's a celebrity.

432
00:28:46,891 --> 00:28:48,643
Why are his lips so thick?

433
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:50,687
It's thick enough to fill three plates.

434
00:28:56,526 --> 00:28:59,612
She told me it was a lie,
but why can't I stop thinking about it?

435
00:29:02,991 --> 00:29:04,075
Filthy jerk.

436
00:29:05,994 --> 00:29:08,163
I can't believe this idiot is a celebrity.

437
00:29:08,246 --> 00:29:10,123
"What a messed up world.

438
00:29:10,206 --> 00:29:12,083
He lied about his personality and name.

439
00:29:12,167 --> 00:29:13,585
And you did what with who?

440
00:29:13,668 --> 00:29:16,546
Quit lying about yourself,
you f****** jerk."

441
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:18,965
Did you write this?

442
00:29:19,048 --> 00:29:20,800
Well, yes.

443
00:29:21,843 --> 00:29:23,386
But they're all facts.

444
00:29:23,470 --> 00:29:26,222
That doesn't matter.
It's still considered defamation.

445
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:30,185
What will you do? The plaintiff is
willing to settle under a few conditions.

446
00:29:32,145 --> 00:29:33,521
Fine. I'll settle.

447
00:29:37,108 --> 00:29:41,070
Does that mean you're also here
for the same reason?

448
00:29:43,406 --> 00:29:44,824
Did you always hate Anthony?

449
00:29:44,908 --> 00:29:47,035
I didn't even know he was a celebrity.

450
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,077
What?

451
00:29:48,870 --> 00:29:50,038
Then what happened?

452
00:29:50,830 --> 00:29:53,082
I don't know.
I just got angry all of a sudden.

453
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:54,918
What's going on?

454
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:56,544
Why is everyone here?

455
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:03,802
You're all the same.

456
00:30:04,844 --> 00:30:06,054
Your daughter's here too?

457
00:30:06,137 --> 00:30:08,807
Did you write hateful comments about me?

458
00:30:09,557 --> 00:30:10,767
What's that?

459
00:30:10,850 --> 00:30:15,438
It's when someone badmouths someone online

460
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:18,107
and leaves a malicious comment.

461
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,861
Why would I do that online
when I can do it face to face?

462
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,490
You both look so much alike
that it's starting to bother me.

463
00:30:26,699 --> 00:30:28,952
Anyway, you'd better do a good job.

464
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:33,832
-Everyone, gather around.
-Take one each.

465
00:30:38,419 --> 00:30:40,004
I'm sure you all know

466
00:30:40,588 --> 00:30:44,509
that other celebrities
never go easy on their haters.

467
00:30:44,592 --> 00:30:46,010
But this is who I am.

468
00:30:46,094 --> 00:30:47,929
I, Anthony,

469
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:51,224
was kind enough to forgive you like this.

470
00:30:52,392 --> 00:30:54,727
Let's forget about the past.

471
00:30:54,811 --> 00:30:57,397
Let's use this chance
to make this world a better place

472
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:01,234
and to cleanse your souls
so you can become better people.

473
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,570
What do you say?

474
00:31:04,445 --> 00:31:05,697
Isn't that nice?

475
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:10,743
-Let's all clap!
-Give him a round of applause.

476
00:31:10,827 --> 00:31:14,622
I told you your jobs earlier,
so you can start working there.

477
00:31:14,706 --> 00:31:17,500
Let's go. Go on.

478
00:31:17,584 --> 00:31:19,127
Get to work.

479
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:23,423
Ms. Bahn, you're in charge
of feeding the dogs.

480
00:31:23,506 --> 00:31:24,799
Oh, okay.

481
00:31:25,800 --> 00:31:27,677
You're not on the list.

482
00:31:27,760 --> 00:31:29,846
-Are you here to help?
-No way. I'm not--

483
00:31:29,929 --> 00:31:32,473
Yes, she's here to help.

484
00:31:32,557 --> 00:31:36,519
She absolutely adores puppies.
Isn't that right? Come on.

485
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:37,937
-Come this way.
-Sure.

486
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:39,230
-But--
-Let's go.

487
00:31:39,314 --> 00:31:40,857
-What's my job?
-Oh, right.

488
00:31:41,357 --> 00:31:43,651
Mr. Han, you were asked
to do something special.

489
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:46,237
-What?
-Please come with me.

490
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:47,322
But…

491
00:31:51,784 --> 00:31:54,370
Yes, Ms. Han.
He came to do volunteer work.

492
00:31:55,288 --> 00:31:57,332
-"Volunteer work"?
-Yes.

493
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,084
What's gotten into him?

494
00:32:01,794 --> 00:32:02,921
Anything else?

495
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:06,132
He decided to enter
the company in-house contest.

496
00:32:06,841 --> 00:32:09,177
The contest? Alone?

497
00:32:09,260 --> 00:32:12,180
He asked around at first,
but he eventually teamed up

498
00:32:12,263 --> 00:32:15,183
with Ms. Bahn Ha-ni
from the Product Development Team.

499
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,602
What kind of a name is that?
Who is this Bahn Ha-ni?

500
00:32:17,685 --> 00:32:21,314
The lady who's rumored to have
gotten the job thanks to the chairman.

501
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:22,857
He's unbelievable.

502
00:32:26,903 --> 00:32:31,366
I think we need to continue
to keep an eye on Yu-hyeon.

503
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,117
So get ready to switch teams.

504
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:35,203
Pardon? "Switch teams"?

505
00:32:39,082 --> 00:32:42,001
They're sick,
so they're not potty trained.

506
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:45,380
I'm impressed that you volunteered
to take care of these guys.

507
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,341
-Me?
-Well then.

508
00:32:49,842 --> 00:32:51,052
I'll leave you to it.

509
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,641
My gosh. Anthony, that jerk.

510
00:33:10,863 --> 00:33:13,533
Gyeong-sik, this place looks nice.
Let's take a photo here.

511
00:33:13,616 --> 00:33:14,617
Okay.

512
00:33:16,744 --> 00:33:17,829
Let's take a photo.

513
00:33:17,912 --> 00:33:19,038
Forget it.

514
00:33:19,622 --> 00:33:21,708
It's all a part of the settlement.

515
00:33:24,502 --> 00:33:27,088
-Make it quick.
-Okay.

516
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:30,008
I think it'll look nice
if you hold the dog for the photo.

517
00:33:30,091 --> 00:33:31,134
Really? Okay.

518
00:33:31,217 --> 00:33:32,844
-Here.
-Okay. Come on.

519
00:33:32,927 --> 00:33:36,014
There we go. Good dog.

520
00:33:36,097 --> 00:33:38,516
-Are you having fun?
-The dog's peeing!

521
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:45,523
Gosh, I'm sorry.

522
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:47,608
One, two…

523
00:33:58,244 --> 00:34:00,204
Why don't you come here and help me out?

524
00:34:00,288 --> 00:34:02,957
Why? You're the one
who got yourself in trouble.

525
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:06,085
I helped you
every time you got yourself in trouble.

526
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:09,797
You're an adult.

527
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,424
I'm still a little kid.

528
00:34:12,091 --> 00:34:14,052
Learn to clean up after yourself.

529
00:34:14,135 --> 00:34:15,303
Got it? Okay, good.

530
00:34:17,847 --> 00:34:19,974
Hey!

531
00:34:27,315 --> 00:34:28,900
Let's take a photo here.

532
00:34:30,276 --> 00:34:33,029
How about you prepare the food?

533
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,699
Well, I guess that could work. Okay.

534
00:34:37,825 --> 00:34:40,453
Make it look natural.

535
00:34:41,454 --> 00:34:42,538
I'm sorry.

536
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:46,834
It's okay.
It's not like you did it on purpose.

537
00:34:48,711 --> 00:34:49,629
Smile.

538
00:34:51,881 --> 00:34:53,216
I think that's enough.

539
00:34:53,299 --> 00:34:54,258
Let's go.

540
00:35:08,356 --> 00:35:09,982
Look. They keep liking it.

541
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:11,943
Do you see that?

542
00:35:12,777 --> 00:35:14,237
Jeong-man.

543
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:15,738
How do they like my photos?

544
00:35:15,822 --> 00:35:17,448
You're getting so many likes.

545
00:35:18,241 --> 00:35:19,075
That's good.

546
00:35:19,700 --> 00:35:21,619
I'm glad I volunteered.

547
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:25,540
Hey. Why aren't you working?

548
00:35:25,623 --> 00:35:29,252
-Shouldn't you help your mom?
-It's none of your beeswax.

549
00:35:29,335 --> 00:35:31,629
That's true. Let's go take more photos.

550
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:33,297
Okay.

551
00:35:35,716 --> 00:35:36,843
Hey, kid.

552
00:35:38,678 --> 00:35:40,513
-What is it?
-You're incredible.

553
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:43,683
How did you intimidate Anthony like that?

554
00:35:44,559 --> 00:35:46,477
Gosh. Here.

555
00:35:47,103 --> 00:35:48,020
CEO PARK JEONG-MAN

556
00:35:50,064 --> 00:35:51,149
What is this?

557
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,401
Call me if you're interested
in becoming a star.

558
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:56,362
My name rings out a bit
in this line of work.

559
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,531
Well, I'll give you that.

560
00:35:59,490 --> 00:36:03,035
Seeing how you transformed Chun-sik,
I can see how competent you are.

561
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,621
I'll think about it.

562
00:36:10,293 --> 00:36:11,419
She gives me the chills.

563
00:36:12,378 --> 00:36:15,214
She really is something
despite her young age.

564
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:17,383
Sit down.

565
00:36:23,973 --> 00:36:25,016
Is this it?

566
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:29,228
I couldn't sleep a wink for days
because I craved it so much.

567
00:36:30,354 --> 00:36:32,315
You should've asked me to buy some.

568
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,692
She closes down
once she runs out of ingredients.

569
00:36:34,775 --> 00:36:36,027
Let's hurry.

570
00:36:41,657 --> 00:36:44,202
Grandma, it's been way too long,
hasn't it?

571
00:36:44,285 --> 00:36:46,370
Goodness. You must have been so busy.

572
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:49,040
I'd like 3,000 won's worth
of twisted breadsticks to go.

573
00:36:49,123 --> 00:36:51,292
-Okay.
-I'll eat one right now.

574
00:36:51,375 --> 00:36:52,210
Sure.

575
00:36:57,548 --> 00:36:58,591
It's so delicious.

576
00:37:07,350 --> 00:37:09,435
I won't ask for a bite, so take your time.

577
00:37:11,687 --> 00:37:13,648
How do you know this place?

578
00:37:15,942 --> 00:37:17,151
When I was young,

579
00:37:18,110 --> 00:37:20,279
my grandmother used to work here.

580
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:23,824
So after school, Ha-ni and I would often…

581
00:37:27,495 --> 00:37:29,914
have these twisted breadsticks.

582
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,876
I wonder how tasty they are
for you to eat them that often.

583
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:35,169
-Should I try some?
-Sure.

584
00:37:36,545 --> 00:37:38,005
-I'll try one.
-Okay.

585
00:37:48,975 --> 00:37:50,893
-Here.
-Gosh, thanks.

586
00:37:54,855 --> 00:37:56,357
It's so good.

587
00:37:57,108 --> 00:37:59,819
-It's so tasty.
-It's my treat today.

588
00:37:59,902 --> 00:38:01,237
Really? Thanks.

589
00:38:01,737 --> 00:38:03,781
-Enjoy and eat up.
-Okay.

590
00:38:04,365 --> 00:38:06,742
Wait. Should I buy some for my grandma?

591
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:10,371
Ma'am, may I get 1,000 won's worth to go?

592
00:38:27,096 --> 00:38:28,848
You can give me your vests.

593
00:38:32,476 --> 00:38:34,312
Did you post the photos in real time?

594
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:36,314
Yes. They shared them and wrote about you.

595
00:38:37,732 --> 00:38:38,691
It worked.

596
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:41,277
-Tell them they can leave.
-No.

597
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,904
They all worked so hard.
We ought to buy them a meal.

598
00:38:44,739 --> 00:38:46,615
That's just a waste of money.

599
00:38:46,699 --> 00:38:48,576
What if they badmouth you?

600
00:38:48,659 --> 00:38:50,828
-Why would they?
-Look at their faces.

601
00:38:58,044 --> 00:38:59,712
Look for the cheapest place.

602
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:02,882
Great job today, everyone.

603
00:39:02,965 --> 00:39:05,134
The dogs looked so happy.

604
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:08,763
Please treat him well.

605
00:39:08,846 --> 00:39:11,974
If you post great stories about him,
I'll treat you again.

606
00:39:14,393 --> 00:39:15,853
Eat up.

607
00:39:15,936 --> 00:39:16,937
Anthony!

608
00:39:17,021 --> 00:39:20,232
-Anthony!
-Anthony!

609
00:39:21,233 --> 00:39:24,820
-Why beer? Chicken would have been enough.
-Chicken and beer go hand in hand.

610
00:39:24,904 --> 00:39:25,780
Are you paying?

611
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,576
-Enjoy.
-Enjoy.

612
00:39:30,659 --> 00:39:31,702
Enjoy.

613
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:34,830
Excuse me. Can we have some Coke?

614
00:39:34,914 --> 00:39:37,291
Coke isn't good for you. Just have water.

615
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:41,420
I'll drink whatever I want,
so can you mind your own business?

616
00:39:42,004 --> 00:39:43,047
Sure.

617
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,276
Yu-hyeon.

618
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,279
Why aren't you eating?

619
00:40:08,197 --> 00:40:09,657
I'm not hungry.

620
00:40:10,699 --> 00:40:11,534
By the way,

621
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:15,579
do you smell anything on me?

622
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,584
I smell urine.

623
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,754
Damn it. I used soap, but it still stinks.

624
00:40:24,964 --> 00:40:28,759
If you go inside,
the smell of chicken might hide it.

625
00:40:30,302 --> 00:40:31,387
It's cold. Go inside.

626
00:40:31,470 --> 00:40:34,557
I don't want to see that guy's face.

627
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:38,477
I wanted to brainstorm some ideas with you
while eating chicken.

628
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,232
Have you thought of anything?

629
00:40:45,067 --> 00:40:46,527
I just ate lots of snacks.

630
00:40:50,656 --> 00:40:52,366
Then do you want to talk more inside?

631
00:40:53,409 --> 00:40:54,660
Hey, don't pour the sauce.

632
00:40:54,743 --> 00:40:57,705
-Great job, everyone.
-Good job, guys.

633
00:40:57,788 --> 00:40:59,248
-Cheers.
-We really worked hard.

634
00:40:59,331 --> 00:41:00,791
-Good work.
-Good work.

635
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,376
We're going to brainstorm.

636
00:41:11,302 --> 00:41:12,595
He's so obnoxious.

637
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:23,522
What? I didn't drink any milk.

638
00:41:25,316 --> 00:41:27,485
HEALTHY CHICKEN DUNKED IN MILK
TO REMOVE THE SMELL

639
00:41:28,819 --> 00:41:30,696
Hey! Anthony!

640
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,073
Are you okay? Anthony!

641
00:41:37,995 --> 00:41:39,121
Anthony.

642
00:41:39,205 --> 00:41:41,290
-Eat up. Eat more.
-It's nothing.

643
00:41:44,460 --> 00:41:45,377
Excuse me.

644
00:41:48,589 --> 00:41:49,965
This is urgent.

645
00:41:51,759 --> 00:41:52,760
Excuse me.

646
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,440
Hey, Chun-sik.

647
00:42:07,399 --> 00:42:08,567
Anthony.

648
00:42:09,276 --> 00:42:11,195
-What's wrong?
-Move.

649
00:42:11,278 --> 00:42:12,279
Are you sick?

650
00:42:12,363 --> 00:42:14,573
Are you okay?
Shouldn't you go to a hospital?

651
00:42:15,324 --> 00:42:16,200
Move.

652
00:42:17,952 --> 00:42:19,286
The word shouldn't get out.

653
00:42:20,663 --> 00:42:23,332
Block the entrance
and don't let anyone come in.

654
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:37,137
Did you eat a lot?

655
00:42:37,721 --> 00:42:39,348
-Coming!
-This is good.

656
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:40,933
You should eat more.

657
00:42:41,016 --> 00:42:42,226
-Sir.
-Yes?

658
00:42:42,309 --> 00:42:44,937
-Your most expensive dish…
-Yes?

659
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:47,439
-Please serve one per table.
-Okay.

660
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:51,277
And please prepare
one serving per person to go as well.

661
00:42:51,360 --> 00:42:53,612
Yes, sir. I'll get them ready immediately.

662
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:09,044
I had no idea.

663
00:43:10,504 --> 00:43:12,047
What took you so long?

664
00:43:12,631 --> 00:43:14,008
I was talking with Anthony.

665
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,469
What did you guys have to talk about
in the toilet?

666
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,596
This and that.

667
00:43:20,889 --> 00:43:22,808
-Eat up.
-Are you okay?

668
00:43:22,891 --> 00:43:25,269
You should've checked properly.

669
00:43:25,352 --> 00:43:27,438
They used milk to get rid of the smell.

670
00:43:27,980 --> 00:43:29,898
Damn it. Are you serious?

671
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,860
-Sir.
-Yes?

672
00:43:33,736 --> 00:43:35,654
The toilet is completely clogged.

673
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,656
-It is?
-It's totally clogged.

674
00:43:38,490 --> 00:43:41,118
Just who did that?

675
00:43:41,201 --> 00:43:42,411
Who was it?

676
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:44,288
-Who went in there?
-Gyeong-sik.

677
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,457
-Yes?
-Go start the engine right now.

678
00:43:47,082 --> 00:43:48,500
-Right now?
-Was it you?

679
00:43:48,584 --> 00:43:49,501
Shut up.

680
00:43:52,004 --> 00:43:54,173
Wait. Before I went in,

681
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:58,927
Anthony and that woman came out.

682
00:44:01,847 --> 00:44:04,725
No way. Then was it Anthony?

683
00:44:04,808 --> 00:44:06,769
-Was it him?
-Gosh.

684
00:44:07,269 --> 00:44:08,479
I should post about this.

685
00:44:08,562 --> 00:44:10,230
Take out your phones right now.

686
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:12,941
Let's all bring him down.

-Post it.
-No way.

690
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:19,531
Post it, and I'll reply to it

691
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:21,241
-How could he?
-Anthony…

692
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:24,161
That's so disgusting. Poor him.

693
00:44:24,244 --> 00:44:25,454
Unbelievable.

694
00:44:25,537 --> 00:44:27,164
It was me.

695
00:44:29,083 --> 00:44:30,501
It was actually me.

696
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:33,671
I hadn't gone to the bathroom in a week.

697
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,255
I'll go unclog it.

698
00:44:36,715 --> 00:44:38,217
It won't take long.

699
00:44:39,176 --> 00:44:40,928
I'm sorry.

700
00:44:41,011 --> 00:44:43,263
It won't take long. Eat up.

701
00:44:52,940 --> 00:44:53,899
Hey.

00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,486
-Why did you do it?
-Do what?

703
00:44:58,654 --> 00:45:01,490
Why did you say it was you?

704
00:45:04,493 --> 00:45:06,120
It would put you in a tough spot.

705
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:09,039
They all hate you back there.

706
00:45:23,137 --> 00:45:24,096
Thanks.

00:45:26,890 --> 00:45:27,933
No problem.

708
00:45:29,518 --> 00:45:32,438
I'm Bahn Ha-ni the Righteous. Remember?

709
00:45:35,065 --> 00:45:37,234
Right. You beat me up so often.

710
00:45:39,653 --> 00:45:41,905
Are you still lactose-intolerant?

711
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,452
I tried everything to fix it,
but it's not that easy.

712
00:45:49,538 --> 00:45:54,168
Does that mean on that day
when you were wearing that uniform…

713
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:56,753
Yes. You're right.

714
00:45:56,837 --> 00:45:58,046
Every time I drink milk,

715
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:00,340
it bursts out like a broken faucet.

716
00:46:02,926 --> 00:46:06,555
You have it rough.
You can't eat whatever you want.

717
00:46:07,222 --> 00:46:09,766
Surprisingly, many people
are lactose-intolerant.

718
00:46:09,850 --> 00:46:11,560
They just don't say it out loud.

719
00:46:12,519 --> 00:46:13,562
You're right.

720
00:46:16,106 --> 00:46:17,774
My boy! Are you all right?

721
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,652
Someone, please call the paramedics!

722
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,779
Hey.

723
00:46:22,863 --> 00:46:24,948
Hey, wake up.

724
00:46:25,032 --> 00:46:26,158
Did you eat this?

725
00:46:26,658 --> 00:46:28,243
Who fed this to my son? Who?

726
00:46:30,954 --> 00:46:32,206
-That's it.
-What?

727
00:46:34,249 --> 00:46:38,128
Snacks for those who can't eat
whatever they want.

728
00:47:04,196 --> 00:47:05,197
Do-yun.

729
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:14,998
You're unbelievable.

730
00:47:16,083 --> 00:47:18,794
-Mother.
-That's what you're eating at this hour?

731
00:47:18,877 --> 00:47:20,879
And you're hiding it?

732
00:47:22,631 --> 00:47:24,091
That's not it.

733
00:47:24,174 --> 00:47:27,553
Haven't I told you numerous times
not to trail off like that?

734
00:47:31,390 --> 00:47:32,349
I'm sorry.

735
00:47:32,432 --> 00:47:35,769
No matter how fancy you look
on the outside,

736
00:47:36,395 --> 00:47:37,604
it can never change

737
00:47:39,231 --> 00:47:40,607
who you truly are.

738
00:47:45,779 --> 00:47:46,822
Mother…

739
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,841
Is something wrong?

740
00:48:07,217 --> 00:48:08,844
What do you like so much about her?

741
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:10,387
What?

742
00:48:11,513 --> 00:48:14,474
I've always bought you the best toys,

743
00:48:14,558 --> 00:48:17,185
so why did you have to choose
such a lowly girl?

744
00:48:19,813 --> 00:48:20,939
Mother.

745
00:48:21,773 --> 00:48:22,941
You're out of line.

746
00:48:23,025 --> 00:48:24,192
You shouldn't…

747
00:48:24,818 --> 00:48:27,237
You shouldn't be siding with her
right now.

748
00:48:27,321 --> 00:48:29,698
Please come to your senses.

749
00:48:31,950 --> 00:48:33,368
Mother, please.

750
00:48:34,786 --> 00:48:36,663
Please stop disappointing me.

751
00:48:38,915 --> 00:48:40,000
Yang Do-yun!

752
00:48:40,709 --> 00:48:42,502
How dare you talk to me like that?

753
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:50,344
I listen to you
not because I'm scared of you,

754
00:48:51,053 --> 00:48:53,597
but because I pity you.

755
00:49:50,862 --> 00:49:54,241
I'm finally back in Seoul

756
00:49:55,200 --> 00:49:57,411
after I ran away like that.

757
00:49:59,538 --> 00:50:01,373
Has it been

758
00:50:01,456 --> 00:50:06,920
twenty years since Gi-tae left?

759
00:50:07,713 --> 00:50:10,173
Mother. Do you remember now?

760
00:50:10,924 --> 00:50:12,968
After we lost him,

761
00:50:13,051 --> 00:50:16,638
you said you'd make a living
as a taxi driver.

762
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:21,017
I just couldn't understand why.

763
00:50:21,727 --> 00:50:25,397
But now that I've traveled to
so many places in this cab,

764
00:50:25,981 --> 00:50:28,316
I finally understand why.

765
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:34,281
If you stayed in one place,
you'd be reminded of him.

766
00:50:34,948 --> 00:50:37,033
Traveling like this

767
00:50:38,034 --> 00:50:40,120
was your way

768
00:50:41,204 --> 00:50:43,331
of enduring the pain.

769
00:50:45,667 --> 00:50:48,587
Yes. I believe so.

770
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,505
I'm sorry.

771
00:50:51,131 --> 00:50:52,716
After losing my son,

772
00:50:52,799 --> 00:50:56,052
I've become such an inconvenience to you.

773
00:50:57,053 --> 00:50:58,430
Not at all.

774
00:51:00,432 --> 00:51:02,434
If it wasn't for you,

775
00:51:02,517 --> 00:51:05,979
I wouldn't have been able
to endure those long years.

776
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,858
Ok-jeong.

777
00:51:10,442 --> 00:51:15,405
You and I have spent more years together
than I did with my son.

778
00:51:16,740 --> 00:51:18,492
You're pretty much my daughter.

779
00:51:21,244 --> 00:51:22,162
Mother.

780
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:25,582
Once I'm done here,

781
00:51:26,249 --> 00:51:28,710
I'll make your life easier.

782
00:51:28,794 --> 00:51:29,878
What?

783
00:51:29,961 --> 00:51:33,465
Mother, what are you saying?

784
00:51:36,384 --> 00:51:39,971
Let's hurry. Ha-yeong must be waiting.

785
00:51:47,020 --> 00:51:49,022
Goodness.

786
00:51:51,358 --> 00:51:53,276
I can't believe
it cost me two million won.

787
00:51:53,360 --> 00:51:55,862
-And why do they have chicken to go?
-Beats me.

788
00:51:55,946 --> 00:51:57,656
How could you not know?

789
00:51:57,739 --> 00:51:59,741
Whatever.

790
00:51:59,825 --> 00:52:00,659
Goodbye.

791
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:01,952
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

792
00:52:02,035 --> 00:52:02,869
Never mind.

793
00:52:03,703 --> 00:52:04,830
Gosh.

794
00:52:08,500 --> 00:52:09,751
-Ha-ni.
-Yes?

795
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:12,295
Get in. I'll drop you off.

796
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:16,341
-It's okay. We can take the bus--
-Yes! I've always wanted to ride one.

797
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:18,134
It's a celebrity's van!

798
00:52:18,218 --> 00:52:19,469
Hey…

799
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:22,806
Thanks.

800
00:52:25,976 --> 00:52:27,018
Me too.

801
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:30,438
Who are you?

802
00:52:32,190 --> 00:52:33,316
I'm her neighbor.

803
00:52:37,946 --> 00:52:40,365
This makes me feel like a star!

804
00:52:41,616 --> 00:52:42,742
Hey.

805
00:52:47,205 --> 00:52:49,082
She looks exactly like you.

806
00:52:50,208 --> 00:52:51,751
-What?
-She's your spitting image.

807
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:55,422
She looks and acts just like you.

808
00:52:56,590 --> 00:52:58,925
That's because we are.

809
00:53:01,303 --> 00:53:02,429
How could I not realize?

810
00:53:03,513 --> 00:53:07,142
-Realize what?
-That you hadn't changed at all.

811
00:53:08,476 --> 00:53:11,187
You're still just as confident, amazing,

812
00:53:12,814 --> 00:53:14,107
and radiant

813
00:53:16,067 --> 00:53:17,611
as you were back then.

814
00:53:19,362 --> 00:53:22,157
That's rich! You called her lousy before!

815
00:53:22,240 --> 00:53:24,117
-When did I?
-At the secondhand shop!

816
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:26,661
-Shut up if you want a ride.
-You said so.

817
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:27,913
-I didn't.
-You did.

818
00:53:27,996 --> 00:53:31,416
Gosh! Stop it, already!
I'm really frazzled.

819
00:53:34,336 --> 00:53:35,837
I'll go now.

820
00:53:45,555 --> 00:53:48,642
Gosh. I haven't had one of these
in a while. It's so tasty.

821
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:51,436
Had I known, I would've bought more.

822
00:53:51,519 --> 00:53:53,563
This reminds me

823
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:56,358
of when Ha-yeong and Ha-ni were little.

824
00:53:57,525 --> 00:54:01,029
When their dad told them
that these were made using real goldfish,

825
00:54:01,112 --> 00:54:03,740
they cried a river.

826
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:07,410
Grandma. Do you remember that?

827
00:54:09,621 --> 00:54:13,583
Do you think I'm demented or something?
Why would I forget that?

828
00:54:15,460 --> 00:54:16,503
Well…

829
00:54:17,462 --> 00:54:19,673
She's in great condition today.

830
00:54:20,507 --> 00:54:22,300
She even remembered your dad's passing.

831
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:25,845
Really?

832
00:54:27,013 --> 00:54:30,558
Grandma, can you recognize me?

833
00:54:32,143 --> 00:54:34,270
Why do you keep asking me?

834
00:54:34,813 --> 00:54:36,147
You're Ha-yeong.

835
00:54:37,315 --> 00:54:39,317
Grandma, what about me?

836
00:54:40,485 --> 00:54:45,824
You're my great-grandson
who looks exactly like your dad.

837
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,577
I'm glad he doesn't take after you.

838
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:52,038
That's right.

839
00:54:53,206 --> 00:54:55,125
Why are you glaring at me?

840
00:54:55,208 --> 00:54:56,668
What's wrong? It's the truth.

841
00:54:57,585 --> 00:54:59,379
Why are you always out to get me?

842
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:03,717
Ok-jeong, I should go rest first.

843
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,261
Okay. You must be tired
from the long car ride.

844
00:55:06,344 --> 00:55:07,804
-I'll make the bed for you.
-No.

845
00:55:07,887 --> 00:55:10,974
It's okay.
You haven't seen her in a while.

846
00:55:11,057 --> 00:55:14,019
You should chat
with Ms. Laser Eyes over here.

847
00:55:15,645 --> 00:55:16,688
Grandma!

848
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:21,359
Right. Have you contacted Ha-ni?

849
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:25,280
No. I was too busy.

850
00:55:25,363 --> 00:55:28,450
You should. Tell her to come by tomorrow
and have dinner with us.

851
00:55:29,534 --> 00:55:31,119
Is she visiting us tomorrow?

852
00:55:32,537 --> 00:55:33,621
My son.

853
00:55:34,330 --> 00:55:37,417
Since when did you like your aunt so much?

854
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:39,335
Go to your room if you're done!

855
00:55:43,631 --> 00:55:44,674
Hey.

856
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:48,511
Why would you scold him like that?
He just got back.

857
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:51,473
-I'm going to send him back.
-Isn't he here for his vacation?

858
00:55:52,724 --> 00:55:54,267
I have my reasons.

859
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:11,701
You poor thing.

860
00:56:12,577 --> 00:56:16,372
I'll save you no matter what.

861
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,255
Bye. Take care.

862
00:56:30,512 --> 00:56:33,932
Thank you. Thanks to you,
we had a comfortable ride back home.

863
00:56:34,516 --> 00:56:35,892
Bye, Mr. Chun-sik.

864
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:38,812
Don't call me that.

865
00:56:41,272 --> 00:56:43,191
-Goodbye, Ha-ni.
-Bye.

866
00:56:43,274 --> 00:56:44,442
Bye.

867
00:56:52,492 --> 00:56:54,577
-Why aren't you leaving?
-Why aren't you?

868
00:56:54,661 --> 00:56:56,204
What's it to you?

869
00:56:57,288 --> 00:56:59,499
We live in the same neighborhood.

870
00:57:01,042 --> 00:57:03,294
-Are you marking your territory?
-Why would I?

871
00:57:04,295 --> 00:57:05,463
Never mind, then.

872
00:57:07,841 --> 00:57:09,008
Ha-ni.

873
00:57:10,426 --> 00:57:11,511
Yes?

874
00:57:11,594 --> 00:57:14,597
Could I have a cup of coffee?

875
00:57:20,895 --> 00:57:23,273
Our house is pretty tiny.

876
00:57:24,023 --> 00:57:25,275
It's okay. I've been there.

877
00:57:30,363 --> 00:57:32,240
-Anthony.
-We want coffee too.

878
00:57:32,323 --> 00:57:33,324
Damn it.

879
00:57:38,621 --> 00:57:39,456
Gosh.

880
00:57:40,623 --> 00:57:41,541
Why are you here?

881
00:57:41,624 --> 00:57:43,626
She and I need to talk about work.

882
00:57:43,710 --> 00:57:46,546
Right? We need to talk about the contest.

883
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:48,381
That's true but…

884
00:57:49,757 --> 00:57:50,842
It's a bit too late.

885
00:57:58,516 --> 00:58:00,143
-This is unbelievable.
-Move.

886
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,269
Damn it.

887
00:58:02,729 --> 00:58:05,315
Gosh, come on. Just leave.

888
00:58:06,399 --> 00:58:07,442
Come on.

889
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,235
I can't believe this.

890
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:12,447
Hey, hurry up.

891
00:58:13,448 --> 00:58:16,493
How could you attract
those good-for-nothings?

892
00:58:16,576 --> 00:58:18,244
I didn't attract anyone.

893
00:58:21,414 --> 00:58:23,333
Damn it.

894
00:58:29,964 --> 00:58:31,883
-Tell me the truth.
-About what?

895
00:58:34,886 --> 00:58:36,054
Do you like Ha-ni?

896
00:58:37,805 --> 00:58:39,349
Me? Who?

897
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:43,228
That old lady? Goodness.

898
00:58:44,562 --> 00:58:46,189
Do you like her?

899
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,361
Yes. I think so.

900
00:59:36,656 --> 00:59:38,533
-What shampoo do you use?
-Why?

901
00:59:38,616 --> 00:59:39,784
You smell nice.

902
00:59:39,867 --> 00:59:43,288
Look for a place in her neighborhood.
Somewhere close to her place.

903
00:59:43,371 --> 00:59:45,999
Is Anthony
falling for his first love again?

904
00:59:46,082 --> 00:59:47,041
You did that on purpose!

905
00:59:47,625 --> 00:59:49,419
Are you entering the contest with her?

906
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:51,629
What makes you think you'll win?

907
00:59:51,713 --> 00:59:54,632
Watch out! I'm going to win
and take all your money!

908
00:59:54,716 --> 00:59:56,676
Are you really going to manage her?

909
00:59:56,759 --> 00:59:58,553
Are you out of your mind?

910
00:59:58,636 --> 01:00:02,557
Not you! Our Ha-ni is here right now!

911
01:00:03,683 --> 01:00:07,645
