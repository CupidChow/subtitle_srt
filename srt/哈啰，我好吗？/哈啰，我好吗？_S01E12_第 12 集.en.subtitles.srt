EPISODE 12

2
00:01:04,773 --> 00:01:06,107
What are you doing here?

3
00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:10,945
What is it? What's wrong?

4
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,239
I'm sorry.

5
00:01:14,324 --> 00:01:16,117
Sorry? What about?

6
00:01:18,953 --> 00:01:20,246
Well…

7
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:21,456
Ji-eun.

8
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,629
Please head inside.

9
00:01:43,186 --> 00:01:46,314
-But…
-At least tell us what this is about.

10
00:01:46,397 --> 00:01:49,150
We received a tip-off
that she had plagiarized her idea

11
00:01:49,234 --> 00:01:51,069
for the in-house contest.

12
00:01:51,569 --> 00:01:52,445
It was plagiarized?

13
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,282
"Plagiarized"?

14
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,620
No way. It's not true.

15
00:02:02,664 --> 00:02:04,040
What are you talking about?

16
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:07,001
We need to conduct an investigation,
so please come with us.

17
00:02:11,756 --> 00:02:12,882
Ms. Bahn!

18
00:02:12,966 --> 00:02:15,426
What are they saying?

19
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:17,929
Shouldn't we first inform Ms. Oh--

20
00:02:18,012 --> 00:02:19,139
-We should.
-Right.

21
00:02:24,018 --> 00:02:25,270
What's going on?

22
00:02:25,895 --> 00:02:27,814
-Well--
-Please get to work.

23
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,743
The Inspection Division?

24
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:42,704
I'm afraid there's been

25
00:02:42,787 --> 00:02:45,373
an unfortunate turn of events
during the in-house contest.

26
00:02:56,050 --> 00:02:57,385
My goodness.

27
00:02:57,468 --> 00:02:59,554
-My gosh!
-Goodness!

28
00:02:59,637 --> 00:03:00,680
Gosh.

29
00:03:00,763 --> 00:03:02,307
Goodness, are you all right?

30
00:03:02,390 --> 00:03:06,144
Be more careful.
You don't want to injure your back.

31
00:03:06,227 --> 00:03:07,729
I'm okay, ladies.

32
00:03:08,605 --> 00:03:11,232
But we're not. We feel terrible.

33
00:03:12,817 --> 00:03:15,153
Hey, you. Mr. Han!

34
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,698
Me?

35
00:03:18,781 --> 00:03:21,451
Of course.
Who else here has "Han" for a surname?

36
00:03:22,702 --> 00:03:24,787
Bring the rest of the rice, will you?

37
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:27,707
-Me?
-Do you want us to do it, then?

38
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,586
Okay.

39
00:03:33,129 --> 00:03:35,173
-He's going.
-Nice.

40
00:03:35,256 --> 00:03:36,674
Good.

41
00:03:36,758 --> 00:03:38,384
You should be careful.

42
00:03:41,179 --> 00:03:42,222
Mr. Han Yu-hyeon?

43
00:03:42,931 --> 00:03:45,683
-Yes? Who are you?
-We're from the Inspection Division.

44
00:03:45,767 --> 00:03:47,185
Please come with us.

45
00:03:49,604 --> 00:03:52,023
What? Why do I need to go with you?

46
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:53,441
You and Ms. Bahn

47
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:56,319
are being investigated for plagiarizing
for the in-house contest.

48
00:03:56,402 --> 00:03:57,445
"Plagiarizing"?

49
00:03:57,528 --> 00:04:00,240
Ms. Bahn is already being questioned,
so come with us.

50
00:04:02,825 --> 00:04:04,494
Let go. I can walk on my own.

51
00:04:05,870 --> 00:04:08,790
There seems to be a misunderstanding.
I'll be right back.

52
00:04:08,873 --> 00:04:10,166
Don't you worry.

53
00:04:14,045 --> 00:04:16,547
What on earth is going on?

54
00:04:16,631 --> 00:04:18,758
What do you mean you were tipped off?

55
00:04:18,841 --> 00:04:21,427
The Inspection Division
was informed this morning

56
00:04:21,511 --> 00:04:23,054
that the winning product

57
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:25,974
plagiarized a product that was
soon to be released by Geoseong.

58
00:04:26,724 --> 00:04:28,434
Yu-hyeon would never do such a thing.

59
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:31,271
They're investigating it.
We'll soon see what happened.

60
00:04:31,354 --> 00:04:33,022
Whether Yu-hyeon was in on it,

61
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,110
or if he was fooled
by that employee Bahn Ha-ni.

62
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,323
Then let me take the lead
in the investigation.

63
00:04:42,407 --> 00:04:45,243
I'll start by verifying
the authenticity of the tip-off.

64
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,787
You and Yu-hyeon are cousins, remember?

65
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:50,790
It won't matter if Yu-hyeon is innocent

66
00:04:50,873 --> 00:04:54,043
if you taint the investigation
by getting involved.

67
00:04:54,877 --> 00:04:58,756
Not taking any action is what's best
for the company and Yu-hyeon right now.

68
00:05:02,677 --> 00:05:05,430
Plagiarism? What the hell is going on?

69
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,598
It's like you heard.

70
00:05:07,682 --> 00:05:10,727
The Inspection Division
is already investigating the case.

71
00:05:10,810 --> 00:05:12,270
No matter what,

72
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:16,065
make sure they do a thorough job
getting to the bottom of this.

73
00:05:17,483 --> 00:05:21,529
But what if Yu-hyeon
is involved in this incident?

74
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:23,573
Our reputation is on the line!

75
00:05:23,656 --> 00:05:27,660
I don't care who was involved.
Everyone involved will pay the price.

76
00:05:28,953 --> 00:05:30,038
I understand.

77
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,374
We will conduct a thorough investigation,

78
00:05:33,958 --> 00:05:36,377
so tuck your worries away
and get some rest.

79
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:38,796
She's right.
You seem like you could use some.

80
00:05:40,381 --> 00:05:43,051
Call me if there's any progress.

81
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:53,686
GEOSEONG CONFECTIONERY
PRODUCT PROPOSAL

82
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:58,441
It's a product soon to be launched
by Geoseong.

83
00:05:59,734 --> 00:06:00,985
What do you think?

84
00:06:01,069 --> 00:06:03,071
GLUTEN-FREE STAR-SNACK

85
00:06:04,155 --> 00:06:05,323
No way.

86
00:06:06,324 --> 00:06:09,410
How could the product be exactly the same?

87
00:06:09,494 --> 00:06:11,370
Could this be a coincidence?

88
00:06:11,454 --> 00:06:14,540
Or maybe you'd like to confess
to plagiarizing the product.

89
00:06:15,458 --> 00:06:16,959
Plagiarism?

90
00:06:17,043 --> 00:06:18,711
I swear I didn't do such a thing.

91
00:06:21,380 --> 00:06:25,051
How could I have known
that they were making the same snack?

92
00:06:25,134 --> 00:06:26,969
I never copied anyone's work.

93
00:06:27,053 --> 00:06:30,640
Ms. Bahn and I went over
every little detail

94
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,475
and came up with this product.

95
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:36,354
Could Ms. Bahn have disguised
Geoseong's recipe

96
00:06:36,437 --> 00:06:39,357
as her own to fool you?

97
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:42,610
She's not that kind of person
and what you're saying is nonsense.

98
00:06:42,693 --> 00:06:45,071
I worked with her
during the whole process.

99
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:49,033
I know first-hand that she worked hard
making this product.

100
00:06:49,117 --> 00:06:52,078
If word gets out that you copied
the work of our rival company,

101
00:06:52,620 --> 00:06:55,123
the damage done to Joa will be immense.

102
00:06:55,706 --> 00:06:58,960
Do you think you can manage that alone?

103
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,090
I didn't do it.

104
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:08,136
I didn't do anything that deceitful.

105
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,308
Old lady.

106
00:07:17,687 --> 00:07:18,855
Are you all right?

107
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:22,942
I'm sure that this is
just a misunderstanding.

108
00:07:23,025 --> 00:07:26,320
The truth will be revealed in the end,
so don't worry.

109
00:07:30,366 --> 00:07:32,160
I'll head back to the office then.

110
00:07:33,578 --> 00:07:34,412
Sure.

111
00:07:47,508 --> 00:07:48,885
You should stop by the house.

112
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,138
Uncle wasn't feeling well,
so he went home early today.

113
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:19,415
What the hell? Why are you here?

114
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,710
Do-yun said to check up on you
since you went home early today.

115
00:08:23,419 --> 00:08:25,254
It's not like you to take a nap though.

116
00:08:26,923 --> 00:08:28,716
-Are you sick?
-As if.

117
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,260
I'm just tired, that's all.

118
00:08:32,428 --> 00:08:34,931
Anyway, what brings you by?

119
00:08:35,598 --> 00:08:38,476
You should know
I won't be at work for a few days.

120
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:40,728
It's because I've been put on leave,

121
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,897
so this isn't me breaking my promise.

122
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:47,151
Dad.

123
00:08:47,235 --> 00:08:50,446
You know me.
I won't do anything that deceitful.

124
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,323
Old lady isn't the type either.

125
00:08:58,579 --> 00:09:02,041
I believe you. I know my son
wouldn't do something like that.

126
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:05,836
It's probably a misunderstanding,
so let's be patient.

127
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,760
You must be fond of the long johns.
I see you're wearing it today as well.

128
00:09:12,843 --> 00:09:15,555
As if. I was just cold, that's all.

129
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:19,308
You must be getting old now
seeing how you get cold.

130
00:09:24,188 --> 00:09:25,189
What now?

131
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,194
Don't be sick, okay?
I don't want to have to grow up.

132
00:09:33,239 --> 00:09:36,242
You saying that
shows how much you've matured.

133
00:09:41,080 --> 00:09:43,958
Stop it. This is embarrassing.

134
00:09:44,458 --> 00:09:47,753
Dad, I'm stronger than you now.

135
00:09:49,005 --> 00:09:51,173
-You must be so proud.
-Of course, I am.

136
00:09:59,682 --> 00:10:00,975
Look how weak you've become.

137
00:10:27,335 --> 00:10:28,419
There.

138
00:10:28,502 --> 00:10:30,004
Don't you know this song either?

139
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,882
I think I heard my dad
playing it in his car.

140
00:10:35,009 --> 00:10:37,136
So this is what they call
a generation gap.

141
00:10:37,219 --> 00:10:40,264
How do you know
all those old songs and dances?

142
00:10:40,973 --> 00:10:42,975
I listen to them every day.

143
00:10:43,059 --> 00:10:44,101
What?

144
00:10:48,272 --> 00:10:49,398
I mean…

145
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,194
K-pop songs catch on
a little later in the States.

146
00:10:53,903 --> 00:10:57,823
At times, it's as if you've come here
from the past.

147
00:11:00,743 --> 00:11:01,702
Me?

148
00:11:01,786 --> 00:11:04,622
Yes, you know old songs and celebrities,

149
00:11:04,705 --> 00:11:06,707
but not the ones
that are currently trending.

150
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:09,543
I know someone who's currently famous.

151
00:11:10,252 --> 00:11:12,963
Not only that, but we're kind of close.

152
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,840
Really? Who?

153
00:11:18,219 --> 00:11:22,515
"I don't want to be playing
immature games with him.

154
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:24,642
But for you,

155
00:11:25,976 --> 00:11:27,770
I will accept this cook-off."

156
00:11:30,314 --> 00:11:31,399
How was that?

157
00:11:32,983 --> 00:11:36,278
Tone it down a notch.
You sound like the Terminator.

158
00:11:36,362 --> 00:11:39,865
Why can't I get the emotions right
when I've done this for so long?

159
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:40,908
Damn it.

160
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,202
It's not like you to be this nervous.

161
00:11:43,285 --> 00:11:46,872
I went through hoops
to get this far in my career, you know.

162
00:11:46,956 --> 00:11:49,083
The peak is right in front of me.

163
00:11:51,127 --> 00:11:52,169
It's salty.

164
00:11:52,253 --> 00:11:54,463
What are you doing over there?

165
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:56,090
Pickling the onions.

166
00:11:56,173 --> 00:11:59,510
How can you worry about that
when my audition is in a few hours?

167
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,013
You've been nervous about this
and haven't been able to eat properly.

168
00:12:03,097 --> 00:12:05,433
I figured this would
increase your appetite.

169
00:12:05,516 --> 00:12:07,309
I've been trying to drop some weight.

170
00:12:07,393 --> 00:12:10,146
When will you ever
be of any help in my life?

171
00:12:10,729 --> 00:12:12,523
-Sorry about that.
-What went in there?

172
00:12:13,190 --> 00:12:14,859
-Fish sauce.
-Gosh, get lost.

173
00:12:15,651 --> 00:12:17,111
It stinks.

174
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,242
This is out of the blue.

175
00:12:23,325 --> 00:12:24,535
SCARLETT

176
00:12:26,036 --> 00:12:27,288
What is it?

177
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:30,458
What? I'm busy, so bye.

178
00:12:32,918 --> 00:12:34,670
-Who was that?
-Ha-ni's daughter.

179
00:12:35,838 --> 00:12:39,258
This isn't some amusement park.
Why did she bring her friend here?

180
00:12:39,758 --> 00:12:42,553
You! Did you just hang up on me?

181
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:48,726
No, actually…
I just have an important audition today.

182
00:12:49,435 --> 00:12:50,478
An audition?

183
00:12:51,979 --> 00:12:54,315
"Yes. Even if I lose everything I have…"

184
00:12:54,398 --> 00:12:55,566
What's your friend's name?

185
00:12:55,649 --> 00:12:57,485
It's Go So-hye. Pretty name, right?

186
00:12:57,568 --> 00:12:59,445
-"Everything I've…"
-Do you want to be a star?

187
00:12:59,528 --> 00:13:01,489
-Mr. Park.
-"Even if it turns into dust…"

188
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,825
-Where are the other celebrities?
-Can you keep it down?

189
00:13:06,744 --> 00:13:08,787
What's gotten into him?

190
00:13:10,915 --> 00:13:12,708
Why are you so short-tempered today?

191
00:13:12,791 --> 00:13:14,460
Why did you bring them with us?

192
00:13:14,543 --> 00:13:16,378
Don't you know how important this is?

193
00:13:16,462 --> 00:13:19,215
But they begged me to let them follow us.

194
00:13:19,298 --> 00:13:20,925
You tell them to leave, then.

195
00:13:23,302 --> 00:13:24,261
This is incredible.

196
00:13:24,970 --> 00:13:27,056
Anthony, have some of this.

197
00:13:27,139 --> 00:13:29,350
It's chamomile tea.
This will help calm you down.

198
00:13:36,023 --> 00:13:37,441
I burned my tongue.

199
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,944
I'm pissed off as it is,
but you bring me hot tea?

200
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,571
-I'm sorry.
-Unbelievable.

201
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,829
-Why is he so on edge?
-We should just go.

202
00:13:50,913 --> 00:13:52,456
We shouldn't have come.

203
00:14:07,555 --> 00:14:12,351
I've known you to be a prick,
but you're even worse today.

204
00:14:12,434 --> 00:14:15,312
I'm not in a good mood today,
so cut it out.

205
00:14:15,396 --> 00:14:17,982
Everyone's worried about you,
so why are you upset?

206
00:14:19,441 --> 00:14:22,736
I'm not. This audition
is just that important to me.

207
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:24,405
It's my last chance.

208
00:14:24,488 --> 00:14:28,742
-How is this your last chance?
-I've tanked three projects in a row now,

209
00:14:28,826 --> 00:14:30,703
so I'm walking on thin ice.

210
00:14:30,786 --> 00:14:33,998
If I don't get this part,
my life will be over.

211
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:36,876
Why would your life be over?

212
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:40,045
You'll just be a less popular celebrity.

213
00:14:40,129 --> 00:14:41,088
What?

214
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:43,591
Mister.

215
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:48,512
At first, I was embarrassed that my mom
wasn't a celebrity

216
00:14:48,596 --> 00:14:51,307
and was living a crappy life.

217
00:14:52,308 --> 00:14:54,435
But I've been quite proud of her recently.

218
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,229
-Do you know why?
-Why?

219
00:14:57,938 --> 00:15:00,691
Her childhood dream
may not have come true,

220
00:15:00,774 --> 00:15:04,778
but she's been living her life proudly
in the best possible way.

221
00:15:06,155 --> 00:15:07,907
She also smiles at the little things.

222
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:09,783
She seems happy.

223
00:15:11,827 --> 00:15:14,663
The Chun-sik I know was a jerk,

224
00:15:15,331 --> 00:15:18,167
but he was someone
who got happy over a salad bun.

225
00:15:19,335 --> 00:15:23,631
But you're loaded now
and are a household name,

226
00:15:24,298 --> 00:15:25,799
but you don't seem happy at all.

227
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:32,097
Anthony, the director is asking for you.

228
00:15:33,057 --> 00:15:34,266
Wait, your hair…

229
00:15:34,808 --> 00:15:37,061
-Let me grab the stylist.
-No.

230
00:15:38,228 --> 00:15:39,229
I'm good.

231
00:15:49,198 --> 00:15:50,407
"Yes, it's okay.

232
00:15:52,868 --> 00:15:54,828
Even if I lose everything I have,

233
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,623
if it's for your sake,

234
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,794
I'd…

235
00:16:04,797 --> 00:16:06,465
be happy with that."

236
00:16:54,888 --> 00:16:58,308
The person you have dialed
is currently unavailable.

237
00:16:58,392 --> 00:17:00,811
Your call will be connected to voice mail…

238
00:17:03,605 --> 00:17:05,566
I told her not to go anywhere.

239
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:29,882
Do you remember the girl I come here with?

240
00:17:29,965 --> 00:17:31,341
-Did she come today?
-Sorry.

241
00:17:32,259 --> 00:17:33,302
Ha-ni!

242
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,640
Ha-ni.

243
00:17:40,851 --> 00:17:42,019
Bahn Ha-ni!

244
00:18:01,497 --> 00:18:03,290
Hey, you're home. Do you want ramyeon?

245
00:18:05,793 --> 00:18:08,504
"You're home"? Where were you?

246
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:12,549
What do you mean? I was home.

247
00:18:19,098 --> 00:18:20,724
You were home?

248
00:18:20,808 --> 00:18:23,727
I searched the entire neighborhood
looking for you.

249
00:18:23,811 --> 00:18:25,604
Really? I'm sorry.

250
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,023
-Where's your phone?
-What?

251
00:18:28,107 --> 00:18:29,316
Why didn't you pick up?

252
00:18:29,900 --> 00:18:32,986
I forgot to charge it,

253
00:18:33,570 --> 00:18:34,613
so it turned off.

254
00:18:36,073 --> 00:18:37,616
Didn't I tell you

255
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,660
not to go anywhere?

256
00:18:42,371 --> 00:18:45,791
I'm not a prisoner.
Why do I always need to stay home?

257
00:18:46,583 --> 00:18:48,377
Plus, I don't cause trouble these days.

258
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,420
Are you kidding me right now?

259
00:18:50,504 --> 00:18:53,715
Do you know how distressed I am
by the fact that you're here?

260
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:56,468
I'm always nervous and anxious.
It drives me crazy.

261
00:18:58,387 --> 00:19:00,347
Do you think I want to be here?

262
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,808
I'm also dying to go back.

263
00:19:02,891 --> 00:19:06,186
I miss Mom, Dad, and Grandma.

264
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:08,981
I miss them every night,
but I do my best to hold it in.

265
00:19:09,064 --> 00:19:12,693
Exactly. I'll help you go back
safe and sound.

266
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,070
So will you please just stay home?

267
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:18,574
I'm already having a hard time,
so don't make it worse!

268
00:19:45,058 --> 00:19:46,935
What are you doing out in the cold?

269
00:19:47,519 --> 00:19:49,104
Please, leave.

270
00:20:01,450 --> 00:20:03,493
Just leave, okay?

271
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,538
I'm embarrassed.

272
00:20:24,431 --> 00:20:25,432
Are you done crying?

273
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,853
I normally don't cry that easily.

274
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:31,897
Don't lie to me.

275
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:36,235
Last time, you were sitting here
crying all by yourself.

276
00:20:36,318 --> 00:20:37,527
How do you know that?

277
00:20:37,611 --> 00:20:39,238
That's not all.

278
00:20:39,321 --> 00:20:41,490
I carried you on my back
when you got drunk,

279
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,992
and you cried that day too.

280
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,244
When did I do that?

281
00:20:45,327 --> 00:20:48,664
Then I guess my back was wet
because you drooled on me.

282
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:01,969
By the way…

283
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:04,513
why were you crying?

284
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:06,932
Is it because of what happened today?

285
00:21:10,143 --> 00:21:11,895
No, it's just…

286
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,482
I just feel so pathetic

287
00:21:17,150 --> 00:21:18,277
and I hate myself.

288
00:21:20,362 --> 00:21:24,700
I thought I'd be an amazing person
when I grew up.

289
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:28,078
But now that I've become one,

290
00:21:29,037 --> 00:21:32,457
I'm still foolish and clumsy.

291
00:21:37,379 --> 00:21:38,588
I'm a mess.

292
00:21:40,882 --> 00:21:43,385
Everyone's like that.

293
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:48,181
People just pretend to be mature
as they age.

294
00:21:48,265 --> 00:21:51,852
But deep down inside,
we're not that different.

295
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:52,978
But still…

296
00:21:55,856 --> 00:21:58,066
I didn't know I'd be this pathetic.

297
00:21:59,276 --> 00:22:02,070
It's not her fault that she's in danger,

298
00:22:03,780 --> 00:22:05,198
but I took my anger out on her.

299
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:08,368
And the fact that I couldn't say anything

300
00:22:09,536 --> 00:22:11,038
even after what happened today…

301
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:15,292
makes me feel useless.

302
00:22:17,294 --> 00:22:20,380
I don't agree. I think you're amazing.

303
00:22:23,550 --> 00:22:24,760
-Me?
-Yes.

304
00:22:25,469 --> 00:22:27,220
Every time I look at you,

305
00:22:28,597 --> 00:22:31,725
you make me want to be a better person.

306
00:22:32,642 --> 00:22:36,563
Not everyone has the ability
to do that, you know.

307
00:22:36,646 --> 00:22:38,482
The ability to change someone's life

308
00:22:38,565 --> 00:22:40,776
and make them want to become
a better person.

309
00:22:40,859 --> 00:22:44,696
It's like a supernatural power.
You're like Superman.

310
00:22:45,322 --> 00:22:46,364
Thank you…

311
00:22:47,657 --> 00:22:49,034
for saying that.

312
00:22:49,117 --> 00:22:53,747
Plus, no one thought we'd win the contest.

313
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:56,124
But we did.

314
00:22:57,084 --> 00:22:59,252
So I'm sure we'll overcome…

315
00:23:01,254 --> 00:23:02,380
what happened today.

316
00:23:06,134 --> 00:23:09,930
Let's wish each other good luck
just like how we did for the contest.

317
00:23:10,013 --> 00:23:10,972
We're a team.

318
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:21,900
Old Lady.

319
00:23:22,484 --> 00:23:23,693
Cheer up.

320
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,347
-What are you doing?
-What?

321
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:55,684
Here.

322
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:57,394
NORTH, EAST, SOUTH, WEST

323
00:23:58,436 --> 00:24:00,981
-What is that?
-Just pick one.

324
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,987
East, four times.

325
00:24:08,113 --> 00:24:10,407
One, two, three, four.

326
00:24:11,366 --> 00:24:13,702
"Say that you're sorry."

327
00:24:14,619 --> 00:24:15,912
What's that?

328
00:24:15,996 --> 00:24:18,373
It's your punishment. Now apologize to me.

329
00:24:18,456 --> 00:24:19,499
Why should I?

330
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,419
Because you hurt me.

331
00:24:30,177 --> 00:24:31,261
I'm sorry

332
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:33,680
for hurting you.

333
00:24:37,517 --> 00:24:39,519
I was exhausted today,

334
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:42,522
and I think I took it out on you.

335
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,192
Why? Did something happen?

336
00:24:46,818 --> 00:24:50,405
It's nothing to worry about.
It'll get better.

337
00:24:50,488 --> 00:24:53,950
If you're having a hard time,
feel free to tell me.

338
00:24:54,576 --> 00:24:56,369
I'll always be on your side.

339
00:24:58,371 --> 00:24:59,456
Thank you.

340
00:25:01,124 --> 00:25:02,626
It's my turn.

341
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:06,254
I choose South. Five times.

342
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:08,465
One, two, three, four, five.

343
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:12,260
Gosh.

344
00:25:12,969 --> 00:25:15,013
This is the worst punishment.

345
00:25:15,096 --> 00:25:17,474
I guess I'm also being punished
for hurting you.

346
00:25:18,808 --> 00:25:21,186
I guess I have no choice. Okay then.

347
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:43,500
SAY THAT YOU'RE SORRY

348
00:25:57,681 --> 00:25:58,848
What are you doing?

349
00:25:59,724 --> 00:26:02,185
I just have a few things to think about.

350
00:26:06,231 --> 00:26:09,526
Honey, do you know anything
about the plagiarism incident?

351
00:26:11,361 --> 00:26:12,529
No.

352
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:16,283
I don't know.

353
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:20,704
Okay then. I'm going to wash up.

354
00:26:38,555 --> 00:26:39,973
Hello, sir.

355
00:26:40,056 --> 00:26:42,267
I'm Yang Do-yun,
the Product Director at Joa Confectionary.

356
00:26:43,143 --> 00:26:45,520
Can we meet tomorrow?

357
00:26:46,813 --> 00:26:49,482
Okay, thank you. Where should we meet?

358
00:26:50,859 --> 00:26:52,027
Okay.

359
00:26:52,110 --> 00:26:53,445
OVEN-BAKED RICE TOFU SNACK

360
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,659
RICE TOFU SNACK RECIPE

361
00:27:00,785 --> 00:27:02,746
It's like they copied our proposal.

362
00:27:03,538 --> 00:27:06,082
How can everything be exactly the same?

363
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:11,171
Come in.

364
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:15,717
-Sir.
-Seung-seok, what's up?

365
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:20,680
Are you okay about
what happened earlier today?

366
00:27:21,431 --> 00:27:24,809
No, not really.
But I'm sure it'll be fine.

367
00:27:24,893 --> 00:27:26,603
We didn't plagiarize anything.

368
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:29,939
People just have similar ideas, right?

369
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:32,609
Geoseong probably had
the same idea by coincidence.

370
00:27:34,361 --> 00:27:36,321
Yes, I agree.

371
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,783
It was either a coincidence
or a misunderstanding.

372
00:27:41,451 --> 00:27:43,244
Anyway, thanks for being concerned.

373
00:27:43,912 --> 00:27:45,580
No problem.

374
00:27:45,663 --> 00:27:47,665
Anyway, good night.

375
00:27:48,333 --> 00:27:49,334
You too.

376
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:09,729
Wake up.

377
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:16,069
What's with you? Why are you
cleaning so early in the morning?

378
00:28:16,152 --> 00:28:17,487
Shouldn't you go to work?

379
00:28:18,738 --> 00:28:20,115
I took a few days off.

380
00:28:22,325 --> 00:28:26,121
Really? Then why don't we go somewhere?

381
00:28:27,122 --> 00:28:29,749
No. I'm going to clean the house,
so wake up.

382
00:28:30,250 --> 00:28:32,794
No. We hate cleaning.

383
00:28:34,003 --> 00:28:35,422
That's because we had Mom.

384
00:28:37,799 --> 00:28:39,259
Now wake up already.

385
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:47,684
Ladies.

386
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:49,310
Are you busy?

387
00:28:50,145 --> 00:28:51,813
-My goodness.
-Hey.

388
00:28:53,648 --> 00:28:55,692
-You poor thing.
-Are you okay?

389
00:28:55,775 --> 00:28:58,486
I'm okay. I get to sleep in. It's nice.

390
00:28:58,987 --> 00:29:02,991
You have no idea how worried we were
after you got dragged out like that.

391
00:29:03,074 --> 00:29:04,617
We were worried sick.

392
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:06,578
I thought you guys hated me.

393
00:29:06,661 --> 00:29:09,289
It's okay for me
to be hard on someone I care about,

394
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:11,916
but it's never okay
when someone else does it.

395
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,586
Anyway, thank you.

396
00:29:14,669 --> 00:29:16,963
It'll all turn out well, so don't worry.

397
00:29:17,046 --> 00:29:17,881
Okay.

398
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,342
-Thank goodness.
-By the way, where's Seung-seok?

399
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:22,343
The newbie?

400
00:29:23,303 --> 00:29:26,514
I heard he went back to his old team.

401
00:29:34,939 --> 00:29:36,024
Yu-hyeon.

402
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,692
-Hey.
-What's up?

403
00:29:37,776 --> 00:29:40,779
I went to your room this morning
to discuss something,

404
00:29:40,862 --> 00:29:41,821
but you left early.

405
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:45,867
I had to come earlier than usual
because I got transferred to another team.

406
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:48,161
I'm happy for you.

407
00:29:48,244 --> 00:29:51,289
A smart and competent guy like you
shouldn't work at the cafeteria.

408
00:29:52,582 --> 00:29:55,084
Does that mean you no longer need

409
00:29:55,752 --> 00:29:58,463
-to keep an eye on me?
-What?

410
00:30:00,006 --> 00:30:01,508
Let's talk somewhere else.

411
00:30:01,591 --> 00:30:04,260
I think you might feel uncomfortable
talking about it here.

412
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,028
Mom.

413
00:30:26,449 --> 00:30:29,410
Are you here to meet the team manager
from Geoseong Confectionery?

414
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,287
How did you--

415
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:34,123
There's no need to wait. He's not coming.

416
00:30:43,466 --> 00:30:47,554
I thought about it all night.

417
00:30:48,471 --> 00:30:50,723
-And it seemed so weird.
-What do you mean?

418
00:30:50,807 --> 00:30:53,768
It's true they investigated me
for plagiarism.

419
00:30:54,727 --> 00:30:59,274
But I didn't know which company
I plagiarized until I was questioned.

420
00:31:00,149 --> 00:31:04,279
But how did you know
that the company in question was

421
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,156
-Geoseong Confectionery.
-What?

422
00:31:07,240 --> 00:31:09,325
I never told you about it.

423
00:31:11,286 --> 00:31:14,038
That's because
they're our biggest competitor--

424
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,707
Why did you do it, Seung-seok?

425
00:31:22,839 --> 00:31:23,840
By any chance…

426
00:31:26,759 --> 00:31:30,555
was my aunt involved in this?

427
00:31:33,975 --> 00:31:36,728
No, I don't understand what you mean.

428
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:39,689
-What?
-I think you're mistaken.

429
00:31:40,398 --> 00:31:42,650
I need to go now. I'll see you.

430
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:46,446
Seung-seok.

431
00:31:51,242 --> 00:31:53,161
So what is it that you want to know?

432
00:31:54,537 --> 00:31:56,122
I don't think Yu-hyeon

433
00:31:56,205 --> 00:31:58,833
or Ms. Bahn plagiarized
Geoseong Confectionery's product.

434
00:31:59,375 --> 00:32:01,127
They would have been caught.

435
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,547
So I wanted to see
if it was really a coincidence,

436
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:06,841
or if there was a back story to it.

437
00:32:06,925 --> 00:32:10,637
I wanted to ask Geoseong Confectionery
how they came to develop it.

438
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,597
But seeing that you're here,

439
00:32:12,680 --> 00:32:14,807
I'm guessing it wasn't just a coincidence.

440
00:32:16,017 --> 00:32:19,395
You're extremely smart, my son.

441
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:23,983
Okay, fine. I did it.

442
00:32:24,901 --> 00:32:28,738
I stole the recipe
that Yu-hyeon developed for the contest

443
00:32:28,821 --> 00:32:30,490
and gave it to Geoseong Confectionery.

444
00:32:31,449 --> 00:32:33,451
Why would you do that?

445
00:32:33,534 --> 00:32:35,828
To nip the bud.

446
00:32:38,164 --> 00:32:39,749
You see…

447
00:32:40,500 --> 00:32:43,795
I devoted my entire life
to Joa Confectionary.

448
00:32:43,878 --> 00:32:48,675
And I will get rid of
anyone who gets in the way of my plan,

449
00:32:49,425 --> 00:32:50,843
even if that person is

450
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:54,514
my one and only nephew.

451
00:32:55,765 --> 00:32:57,517
What do you mean?

452
00:32:58,309 --> 00:33:01,521
Chairman Han will step down
from his position soon,

453
00:33:01,604 --> 00:33:03,439
and he's going to go blind.

454
00:33:05,566 --> 00:33:06,901
You knew?

455
00:33:08,653 --> 00:33:11,447
I guess you knew about it too.

456
00:33:11,990 --> 00:33:16,285
Then do you also know that he wishes
to hire someone else to replace him?

457
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:19,622
Mom, don't tell me you're--

458
00:33:19,706 --> 00:33:20,707
Yes.

459
00:33:21,290 --> 00:33:23,501
I'm never going to have Joa Confectionary

460
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:27,839
hopelessly taken away from me again

461
00:33:27,922 --> 00:33:29,799
for the sake of my family.

462
00:33:29,882 --> 00:33:31,509
Don't say it's for the family.

463
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,720
This is merely to satisfy your greed.

464
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,472
That greed of yours
will never be satisfied.

465
00:33:41,185 --> 00:33:44,522
You may be my mother,
but I won't let this slide.

466
00:33:46,899 --> 00:33:48,276
Take this.

467
00:33:49,694 --> 00:33:51,154
Do you think…

468
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,907
I'm the only one involved in this?

469
00:33:58,828 --> 00:34:00,621
BAHN HA-NI

470
00:34:08,504 --> 00:34:11,049
Ms. Oh, you must also be worried.

471
00:34:11,132 --> 00:34:13,134
-What?
-About Ms. Bahn.

472
00:34:13,926 --> 00:34:15,511
She must've grown on me.

473
00:34:15,595 --> 00:34:16,971
It's hard to focus on work.

474
00:34:18,139 --> 00:34:19,474
Me too.

475
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:24,771
The office feels so empty
now that she's not here.

476
00:34:24,854 --> 00:34:27,273
I'm going to stop worrying about her.

477
00:34:27,356 --> 00:34:30,818
She's not the type
to do anything like that anyway.

478
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:34,739
You're right. She wasn't exactly
great at first,

479
00:34:34,822 --> 00:34:38,868
but it was amazing how she used our snacks
to save a drowning kid.

480
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,036
Exactly.

481
00:34:40,119 --> 00:34:46,042
Seeing her convince the farmers
at the strawberry farm really moved me.

482
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:49,045
She may be a bit clumsy,
but she's always up for a challenge.

483
00:34:49,128 --> 00:34:52,840
We all know she's not the type
to do something so deceitful.

484
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:54,967
My gosh.

485
00:34:55,051 --> 00:34:59,138
I bet she's really upset and sad
right now.

486
00:35:01,724 --> 00:35:05,269
I need to meet someone outside.
I'll go home straight from there.

487
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,688
-Oh, okay. Bye.
-Goodbye.

488
00:35:07,772 --> 00:35:08,940
Bye, Ms. Oh.

489
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:35,007
Come in.

490
00:35:39,387 --> 00:35:41,097
Hey, Yu-hyeon. What is it?

491
00:35:41,764 --> 00:35:44,725
Do you want to grab some drinks?

492
00:35:49,063 --> 00:35:52,358
Ta-da. So-hye and I went to a photo booth.

493
00:35:52,441 --> 00:35:56,279
Technology must've improved.
The photos look awesome.

494
00:35:56,362 --> 00:35:58,865
I asked you to help me with this.

495
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:00,700
I know you can manage without me.

496
00:36:05,454 --> 00:36:07,540
By the way, why did you fall out
with Ji-eun?

497
00:36:07,623 --> 00:36:09,000
You didn't tell me last time.

498
00:36:11,043 --> 00:36:14,505
It was my fault.

499
00:36:16,090 --> 00:36:19,594
I did something to hurt her.

500
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:24,223
Then you could've apologized
and reconciled.

501
00:36:24,307 --> 00:36:26,309
That's easier said than done.

502
00:36:26,392 --> 00:36:30,021
Gosh, why is everything so complicated
with adults?

503
00:36:30,104 --> 00:36:31,814
If you're sorry, then apologize.

504
00:36:31,898 --> 00:36:33,316
If you fought, then reconcile.

505
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:36,027
If you hurt someone, you can embrace them.

506
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:38,696
I just don't get it.

507
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:45,328
When are we eating?

508
00:36:45,411 --> 00:36:46,662
I'm famished.

509
00:36:46,746 --> 00:36:49,332
I was too busy cleaning to cook anything.

510
00:36:49,415 --> 00:36:50,958
Let's just have tteokbokki.

511
00:36:52,460 --> 00:36:54,754
Awesome. I'll go buy some.

512
00:36:54,837 --> 00:36:57,548
-You can finish up cleaning.
-No.

513
00:36:58,174 --> 00:37:00,384
Let's order in.

514
00:37:02,011 --> 00:37:03,971
Why won't you let me go outside?

515
00:37:18,653 --> 00:37:19,862
Ji-eun.

516
00:37:34,669 --> 00:37:36,128
Is there something on my face?

517
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:39,590
No. It's just that you've turned out
extremely gorgeous.

518
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:42,802
Then again, you just didn't
doll yourself up back then.

519
00:37:42,885 --> 00:37:44,845
-You were pretty to begin with.
-What?

520
00:37:44,929 --> 00:37:49,600
Oh, she tends to be a bit random.

521
00:37:50,309 --> 00:37:53,562
You're right. In that sense,
she really does take after you.

522
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:58,985
-Eat up.
-There.

523
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:01,862
Have this.

524
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,116
You love dipping liver
in the tteokbokki sauce.

525
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:06,117
Yes.

526
00:38:06,826 --> 00:38:07,785
What?

527
00:38:10,162 --> 00:38:11,372
How did you…

528
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,003
Ji-eun.

529
00:38:31,183 --> 00:38:32,184
I'm sorry.

530
00:38:34,687 --> 00:38:36,731
-It was work-related.
-Okay.

531
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,191
What did you want to talk about?
You look so serious.

532
00:38:40,693 --> 00:38:42,320
I have a question.

533
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:48,326
But I just can't ask Aunt myself
in case it's true.

534
00:38:51,370 --> 00:38:52,330
What is it about?

535
00:38:55,791 --> 00:38:56,834
What should I do

536
00:38:58,044 --> 00:39:01,797
if Aunt was not the person
I thought she was?

537
00:39:05,760 --> 00:39:08,262
-I don't follow you.
-The recent plagiarism incident.

538
00:39:09,972 --> 00:39:12,600
I think she's involved.

539
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:16,479
-What?
-I don't want to believe it either.

540
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:19,774
I don't even understand
why she'd do such a thing.

541
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:23,319
But that's the only way
it makes any sense.

542
00:39:25,613 --> 00:39:26,614
Han Yu-hyeon.

543
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:31,035
You're suspecting my mom right now.

544
00:39:31,118 --> 00:39:32,787
In that case, bring me proof.

545
00:39:32,870 --> 00:39:34,497
If it's solid,

546
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:37,083
then I won't sit still
even if it's my own mom.

547
00:39:39,460 --> 00:39:40,336
I'm leaving.

548
00:40:00,731 --> 00:40:02,775
What are you talking about?

549
00:40:02,858 --> 00:40:05,611
They must have documents
related to Geoseong Confectionery,

550
00:40:05,694 --> 00:40:07,321
but you found none?

551
00:40:07,405 --> 00:40:09,156
We're still looking into it,

552
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:12,451
but we found nothing in their possession
that could prove the charge.

553
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:15,496
Okay. You may leave.

554
00:40:26,507 --> 00:40:28,384
We should speed things up.

555
00:40:34,181 --> 00:40:37,726
Ji-eun… I should've known.

556
00:40:49,280 --> 00:40:52,533
GEOSEONG CONFECTIONERY NEW PRODUCT PLANS

557
00:40:53,909 --> 00:40:56,662
PASTE

558
00:41:28,736 --> 00:41:29,820
What is it?

559
00:41:31,614 --> 00:41:34,658
So you're saying that there is

560
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:37,828
a baby inside you?

561
00:41:40,623 --> 00:41:41,790
Yes.

562
00:41:42,791 --> 00:41:45,920
I can't believe it! She's pregnant!

563
00:41:51,592 --> 00:41:52,801
Congratulations, Ji-eun.

564
00:41:54,845 --> 00:41:55,846
Thanks.

565
00:41:56,347 --> 00:42:00,893
Had your grandma been alive,
she would have been exhilarated.

566
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:04,396
Right.

567
00:42:05,189 --> 00:42:08,901
Ever since you were young,
you wanted to be a good mom.

568
00:42:10,277 --> 00:42:13,697
Your grandmother must have given you
a beautiful baby.

569
00:42:14,406 --> 00:42:15,699
Don't you think so?

570
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:18,744
Yes. I believe so.

571
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:24,333
By the way, who's your husband?

572
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,085
Is he handsome?

573
00:42:26,168 --> 00:42:29,088
Yes. He's extremely handsome.

574
00:42:30,589 --> 00:42:33,842
Could you perhaps show us a photo?

575
00:42:34,802 --> 00:42:35,803
A photo?

576
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,059
Here.

577
00:42:46,397 --> 00:42:49,942
No way. He's so good-looking!

578
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:52,570
Wait. Where did you meet
such a good-looking man?

579
00:42:53,904 --> 00:42:55,239
When I was studying abroad

580
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,158
-in New York.
-"New York"?

581
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,410
In America?

582
00:43:00,119 --> 00:43:02,663
Ji-eun, you've succeeded…

583
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:09,878
I mean…

584
00:43:10,879 --> 00:43:13,424
My mom had often told me

585
00:43:14,049 --> 00:43:16,093
that you did.

586
00:43:19,805 --> 00:43:22,099
-She really is random.
-Yes.

587
00:43:22,683 --> 00:43:24,351
How's his personality?

588
00:43:25,561 --> 00:43:27,187
Is he kind? Does he treat you well?

589
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:28,772
Yes.

590
00:43:29,773 --> 00:43:32,943
He's very kindhearted and treats me well.

591
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:36,071
He's incredible.

592
00:43:38,198 --> 00:43:40,492
If he has some great friends,

593
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:42,828
could you introduce them to my mom?

594
00:43:43,996 --> 00:43:45,748
There are only weirdos around her.

595
00:43:45,831 --> 00:43:47,499
My daughter.

596
00:43:47,583 --> 00:43:49,251
Eat this. You're hungry, right?

597
00:43:49,335 --> 00:43:51,337
Here you go.

598
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:52,713
You said you were hungry.

599
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:55,382
Look at you eating so well. Eat up.

600
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,510
You don't have to see me out.

601
00:43:58,594 --> 00:44:00,220
But you're pregnant.

602
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,972
My car's right there.

603
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:03,057
Still…

604
00:44:04,558 --> 00:44:05,559
I'll tag along.

605
00:44:05,643 --> 00:44:07,311
Go back in and wash the dishes.

606
00:44:08,395 --> 00:44:10,689
I have to talk to her.

607
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:13,901
Fine.

608
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,905
I hope you visit us again.

609
00:44:21,241 --> 00:44:24,078
I will. Goodbye.

610
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:28,666
Go inside.

611
00:44:29,375 --> 00:44:30,417
-Let's go.
-Okay.

612
00:44:35,923 --> 00:44:39,176
Your daughter looks exactly like you
when you were in high school.

613
00:44:40,219 --> 00:44:43,430
Seeing her reminded me of the past.

614
00:44:44,014 --> 00:44:45,015
I feel the same way.

615
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:50,437
Back then,
I thought we were pretty grown up.

616
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:53,148
But we were kids like her.

617
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,192
I know.

618
00:44:56,777 --> 00:44:59,405
-By the way, Ji-eun…
-Yes?

619
00:45:01,740 --> 00:45:05,119
I wanted to apologize.

620
00:45:06,120 --> 00:45:07,287
For what?

621
00:45:07,371 --> 00:45:11,291
When you had visited me at the hospital,

622
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:15,671
I said some things I should've never said

623
00:45:15,754 --> 00:45:17,339
and hurt you.

624
00:45:18,549 --> 00:45:20,426
I had wanted to apologize sooner,

625
00:45:21,260 --> 00:45:22,970
but I couldn't muster up the courage.

626
00:45:25,347 --> 00:45:26,640
I'm sorry.

627
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:30,644
Don't be.

628
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:34,857
You were having

629
00:45:35,482 --> 00:45:37,609
a tough time because your dad

630
00:45:38,694 --> 00:45:39,778
had passed away.

631
00:45:41,029 --> 00:45:44,158
Despite being aware of that,

632
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:47,411
I hated you a lot back then.

633
00:45:49,371 --> 00:45:52,207
But if you think about it, we were both

634
00:45:54,042 --> 00:45:55,669
very young.

635
00:45:57,671 --> 00:45:58,839
But, still…

636
00:46:00,799 --> 00:46:05,053
thank you for apologizing.

637
00:46:06,722 --> 00:46:10,058
Don't thank me.
I'm sorry I couldn't say it sooner.

638
00:46:15,397 --> 00:46:19,067
Actually, I visited you today
to tell you this.

639
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:21,570
What?

640
00:46:22,738 --> 00:46:26,492
Don't worry too much
about the plagiarism incident.

641
00:46:26,575 --> 00:46:29,620
I'm confident that it'll turn out well,

642
00:46:29,703 --> 00:46:32,956
so don't be too anxious.

643
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:36,001
Just think that you're taking a break.

644
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:38,879
Thanks, Ji-eun.

645
00:46:42,716 --> 00:46:46,303
-By the way, you're popular in our team.
-What?

646
00:46:46,386 --> 00:46:49,014
They are all worried and waiting for you.

647
00:46:50,349 --> 00:46:52,559
It's as if they knew how popular
you used to be.

648
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,072
What are you doing?

649
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:08,367
I'm writing down the things
I should tell Ji-eun when I return.

650
00:47:08,951 --> 00:47:10,452
-Like what?
-What?

651
00:47:11,161 --> 00:47:14,248
"You're going to be a pretty, smart,

652
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:16,416
and successful woman.

653
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:20,170
And you'll meet a handsome husband
in New York,

654
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:21,713
so have some confidence."

655
00:47:28,095 --> 00:47:31,682
All right. Go back safely

656
00:47:31,765 --> 00:47:34,726
-and make sure you tell her that.
-Okay.

657
00:47:47,155 --> 00:47:48,156
Do-yun.

658
00:47:49,992 --> 00:47:51,410
Is something wrong?

659
00:47:52,244 --> 00:47:54,538
Why are you drinking alone?

660
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:58,083
You don't have to worry about me.
You can sleep first.

661
00:48:20,522 --> 00:48:22,065
What brings you here this late?

662
00:48:25,986 --> 00:48:28,238
Since I was young,
I hated how selfish you are

663
00:48:28,864 --> 00:48:32,409
and tried to deny it.

664
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,123
But you've finally won.

665
00:48:39,916 --> 00:48:43,378
-What?
-What do I need to do from now on…

666
00:48:44,296 --> 00:48:47,049
in order to protect you and Ji-eun?

667
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:51,803
YEJOO HOUSING

668
00:48:57,976 --> 00:48:59,186
Aunt.

669
00:49:01,313 --> 00:49:03,982
You always look after me. Thank you.

670
00:49:04,066 --> 00:49:07,319
How could I not?

671
00:49:19,998 --> 00:49:22,292
Seung-seok, let's talk.

672
00:49:38,266 --> 00:49:40,394
You had him transferred?

673
00:49:40,477 --> 00:49:43,021
He was promoted, so he'll stay quiet.

674
00:49:47,192 --> 00:49:51,113
Do-yun, I feel so reassured
to have you on my side.

675
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:54,282
You were in a haste and left many traces.

676
00:49:54,366 --> 00:49:55,659
I'm getting rid of them,

677
00:49:55,742 --> 00:49:58,453
so from now on,
make sure you run everything by me.

678
00:50:11,091 --> 00:50:13,135
Do you think you can trust your son?

679
00:50:13,218 --> 00:50:14,636
You don't have to worry.

680
00:50:15,220 --> 00:50:19,057
Even the weakest animals
will bare their teeth

681
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,767
in order to protect their family.

682
00:50:20,851 --> 00:50:23,228
I'm sure you know best.

683
00:50:24,020 --> 00:50:25,605
How are things going?

684
00:50:26,648 --> 00:50:28,984
Soon, they'll be releasing the articles.

685
00:50:29,067 --> 00:50:31,862
You'll have to purchase
all the thrown-out stocks,

686
00:50:33,196 --> 00:50:34,698
so prepare yourself.

687
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,251
So this is how it ends.

688
00:50:49,254 --> 00:50:50,714
-Having fun?
-Yes.

689
00:50:51,757 --> 00:50:55,260
I really love that I can read comic books
and watch dramas

690
00:50:55,343 --> 00:50:57,095
until the end.

691
00:50:58,972 --> 00:51:02,726
But I'm not too happy
about finding out how I'll turn out.

692
00:51:02,809 --> 00:51:04,770
I'm not buying you more comics.

693
00:51:04,853 --> 00:51:06,396
-I was kidding.
-I won't.

694
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:07,606
Apologize.

695
00:51:07,689 --> 00:51:08,899
You're so cheap.

696
00:51:11,067 --> 00:51:12,068
Who could that be?

697
00:51:19,451 --> 00:51:20,660
Anthony.

698
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:22,162
I heard you're on a break.

699
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:23,580
How did you know that?

700
00:51:24,122 --> 00:51:25,415
Let's go on a picnic.

701
00:51:30,003 --> 00:51:31,630
Are we really going out?

702
00:51:33,006 --> 00:51:35,675
Wait here. I'll get ready in a jiffy.

703
00:51:35,759 --> 00:51:38,261
Scarlett texted me, saying she was bored.

704
00:51:40,430 --> 00:51:42,849
I'm sorry for inconveniencing you.

705
00:51:42,933 --> 00:51:47,062
Don't be. I wanted to go out as well.
I'm glad she texted me. Let's go.

706
00:51:47,979 --> 00:51:50,357
Look at her. She's dancing with joy.

707
00:51:53,527 --> 00:51:54,528
Okay.

708
00:51:55,111 --> 00:51:58,990
By the way, could we invite
one more person?

709
00:51:59,074 --> 00:52:00,242
Sure.

710
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,577
Who is it?

711
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:09,960
We're here.

712
00:52:11,461 --> 00:52:14,214
-Did you bring your wallet?
-Of course.

713
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:17,175
But why do I need it
when there's no money inside?

714
00:52:17,259 --> 00:52:19,427
Hey, I thought we were going on a picnic.

715
00:52:19,511 --> 00:52:22,514
-So why did he tag along?
-Because I planned this picnic.

716
00:52:22,597 --> 00:52:25,433
You should be thankful and not complain.

717
00:52:26,226 --> 00:52:27,853
Gosh, stop fighting.

718
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:30,146
My mom's not interested
in either of you anyway.

719
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:32,983
She'll be going on a blind date
with a handsome man.

720
00:52:33,066 --> 00:52:34,317
Let's go.

721
00:52:35,360 --> 00:52:37,237
-What? A blind date?
-What? A blind date?

722
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:49,124
Ha-ni.

723
00:52:49,624 --> 00:52:51,334
About what you said earlier,

724
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:54,713
you shouldn't be going on blind dates
with just anyone,

725
00:52:54,796 --> 00:52:57,591
or you could end up meeting a dirtbag.

726
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,093
He's right. There are so many weirdos
these days.

727
00:53:00,176 --> 00:53:01,261
Exactly.

728
00:53:01,344 --> 00:53:02,929
Better than you two, at least.

729
00:53:03,013 --> 00:53:04,639
What's so wrong with us?

730
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,601
-Men of our caliber isn't easy to come by.
-He's right.

731
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,728
We're actually quite decent.

732
00:53:09,811 --> 00:53:11,062
You said it.

733
00:53:11,146 --> 00:53:14,649
At times like these,
they get along so well.

734
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:17,485
Anyway, I'm against her
dating either of you.

735
00:53:18,278 --> 00:53:21,197
Enough with the nonsense. Let's eat.

736
00:53:21,281 --> 00:53:22,198
All right.

737
00:53:22,991 --> 00:53:24,868
My head was hurting anyway.

738
00:53:24,951 --> 00:53:27,037
It's so nice to be out.

739
00:53:27,120 --> 00:53:30,206
So that's why you didn't look
too well today.

740
00:53:30,290 --> 00:53:32,250
You didn't eat anything today, did you?

741
00:53:32,334 --> 00:53:36,421
Ha-ni, I also haven't been
eating well lately because of an audition.

742
00:53:36,504 --> 00:53:38,465
Here you go.

743
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:40,717
Not you. I want her to give me one.

744
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,720
-Then don't.
-Fine. I'll eat it.

745
00:53:43,803 --> 00:53:45,388
Here you go. Eat up.

746
00:53:45,472 --> 00:53:46,681
Thanks.

747
00:53:49,142 --> 00:53:51,686
-Is it good?
-I made this.

748
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:53,647
Don't lie. You bought it.

749
00:53:56,358 --> 00:53:57,567
Thanks for the meal.

750
00:53:58,443 --> 00:53:59,611
It's so delicious.

751
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,824
-Mister, come with me.
-To where?

752
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:06,868
I want some ice cream.

753
00:54:06,952 --> 00:54:08,161
But why me?

754
00:54:08,244 --> 00:54:10,830
Because you're the richest one here.

755
00:54:11,790 --> 00:54:13,416
I bought all of this.

756
00:54:14,626 --> 00:54:16,920
-Ha-ni, do you want anything?
-I'm okay.

757
00:54:17,003 --> 00:54:18,088
-I want coffee.
-Coffee?

758
00:54:18,171 --> 00:54:19,631
-Yes.
-Buy it yourself.

759
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:22,467
-See you soon.
-Okay.

760
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:43,697
Here's your laundry.

761
00:54:44,614 --> 00:54:46,908
-It's our photo album.
-I was just looking.

762
00:54:49,744 --> 00:54:50,870
Goodness.

763
00:54:54,332 --> 00:54:57,669
I recently saw a girl
who looked exactly like Ha-ni.

764
00:54:57,752 --> 00:55:00,714
-What?
-Ha-ni said it was her friend's daughter.

765
00:55:03,091 --> 00:55:05,885
I'm right. She looks exactly like Ha-ni

766
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,013
when she was in high school.

767
00:55:08,096 --> 00:55:10,348
Don't tell me you saw her too.

768
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:13,393
What? Did you see her too?

769
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,103
Where?

770
00:55:16,938 --> 00:55:19,649
Ha-ni let her stay at my house
without my knowing.

771
00:55:19,733 --> 00:55:20,650
What?

772
00:55:24,779 --> 00:55:26,072
Actually,

773
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:29,576
she said it was her own daughter.

774
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:30,493
What?

775
00:55:32,287 --> 00:55:35,623
Hey, Ha-ni has never been pregnant before.
Don't be ridiculous.

776
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,375
That's what I mean.

777
00:55:37,459 --> 00:55:40,003
Then who in the world is that girl?

778
00:55:40,587 --> 00:55:44,340
Why would she lie about her
and live with her even to this day?

779
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:47,177
"Even to this day"?

780
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,307
What was his name again? Jobs?
Did he call you again?

781
00:55:52,390 --> 00:55:54,851
No. Not yet.

782
00:55:56,352 --> 00:55:58,772
And the old phone didn't ring again?

783
00:56:02,150 --> 00:56:04,319
If something ever happens,

784
00:56:04,402 --> 00:56:07,822
promise me that you'll call me.
I'll run over right away.

785
00:56:07,906 --> 00:56:08,948
Thank you.

786
00:56:09,741 --> 00:56:13,244
Despite what happened at work,
you're still taking care of me.

787
00:56:13,912 --> 00:56:16,372
Remember what I said? We're a team.

788
00:56:17,332 --> 00:56:20,251
Hey, let's go over there and make a wish.

789
00:56:30,678 --> 00:56:33,264
WISHING TOWER

790
00:56:40,730 --> 00:56:43,024
Did you pray that she'd return safely?

791
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:46,194
Yes. I also prayed

792
00:56:46,277 --> 00:56:50,281
that we'd all be a little bit happier
than we were yesterday.

793
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:51,950
What about you?

794
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,454
I prayed that all the people I love

795
00:56:56,538 --> 00:56:59,499
won't get hurt in any kind of way.

796
00:57:01,584 --> 00:57:04,379
I'm sure your wish will come true.

797
00:57:04,462 --> 00:57:05,755
Yours too.

798
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:18,768
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-MAN

799
00:57:21,938 --> 00:57:24,190
-We have a problem.
-What is it?

800
00:57:25,483 --> 00:57:27,026
Metallic substances were found

801
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:31,614
in Mom's Love, a popular baby snack
made by Joa Confectionery.

802
00:57:31,698 --> 00:57:35,160
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
is carrying out an urgent investigation.

803
00:57:35,243 --> 00:57:38,329
This came to light when a victim
posted about this incident

804
00:57:38,413 --> 00:57:40,498
-on a popular community webpage.
-What's going on?

805
00:57:42,667 --> 00:57:45,962
Ji-man. This is only the beginning.

806
00:57:49,007 --> 00:57:51,468
Metallic substances were found
in a premium baby snack

807
00:57:51,551 --> 00:57:52,802
made by Joa Confectionery.

808
00:57:52,886 --> 00:57:56,097
The company has ceased all sales
and recalled the products.

809
00:57:56,181 --> 00:57:58,349
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety
believes

810
00:57:58,433 --> 00:58:01,311
that the metallic substances were mixed in

811
00:58:01,394 --> 00:58:03,688
during the manufacturing process.

812
00:58:04,272 --> 00:58:05,815
-They're carrying out
-Sir!

813
00:58:05,899 --> 00:58:07,650
an urgent investigation on the matter.

814
00:58:09,235 --> 00:58:10,612
Sir!

815
00:58:12,447 --> 00:58:14,282
Gosh, my teeth are smarting.

816
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:16,242
Aren't you cold?

817
00:58:16,326 --> 00:58:19,913
Gosh, ice cream tastes the best
when it's cold.

818
00:58:20,580 --> 00:58:22,832
It must be great to be young. Hold on.

819
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:28,421
-Hey, Jeong-man.
-Hey, Anthony! You made it!

820
00:58:28,505 --> 00:58:29,589
Made what?

821
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,425
You got the lead role in Ms. Kim's drama!

822
00:58:32,509 --> 00:58:33,927
Congratulations!

823
00:58:34,552 --> 00:58:35,553
Seriously?

824
00:58:42,101 --> 00:58:43,937
What's all this ruckus about?

825
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,733
It's all thanks to you!

826
00:58:48,816 --> 00:58:50,193
I did it!

827
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:55,156
You're suffocating me! Let me go!

828
00:58:58,993 --> 00:58:59,869
What's wrong?

829
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:05,333
Ha-ni, I got the lead role
I wanted desperately.

830
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:08,962
-Good for you.
-Good for you!

831
00:59:10,505 --> 00:59:13,091
I'm proud of you! Congratulations!

832
00:59:13,174 --> 00:59:14,008
You're the best!

833
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:18,054
Your prayer was really heard.

834
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:20,139
Soon, we'll receive some good news
as well.

835
00:59:21,849 --> 00:59:24,060
Congratulations, Yang Chun-sik.

836
00:59:24,143 --> 00:59:25,395
Thanks.

837
00:59:30,358 --> 00:59:32,235
I had a blast today.

838
00:59:32,318 --> 00:59:33,820
We took a nice trip

839
00:59:33,903 --> 00:59:35,905
and had loads of delicious food.

840
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:38,199
I'm happy that you had a great time.

841
00:59:58,219 --> 01:00:00,680
Hey, Do-yun. What is it?

842
01:00:04,100 --> 01:00:05,101
What?

843
01:00:22,952 --> 01:00:23,953
Dad.

844
01:00:25,371 --> 01:00:26,372
Dad.

845
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:30,084
Dad.

846
01:00:31,002 --> 01:00:33,087
Your prayer was really heard.

847
01:00:33,171 --> 01:00:35,548
Soon, we'll receive some good news
as well.

848
01:01:10,124 --> 01:01:12,919
Something's happened to Joa Confectionery.

849
01:01:13,002 --> 01:01:14,962
-What do I do now?
-Don't you worry about it.

850
01:01:15,046 --> 01:01:16,422
Something's not right.

851
01:01:16,506 --> 01:01:19,884
They don't seem like
a mother and a daughter.

852
01:01:19,967 --> 01:01:22,887
I guess there's nothing I can do
at a time like this.

853
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:24,347
I want to see Dad too.

854
01:01:24,430 --> 01:01:27,100
It wasn't that bad.

855
01:01:27,183 --> 01:01:30,311
At times, I felt as if someone had
sent her to me as a gift.

856
01:01:30,395 --> 01:01:32,647
Are you saying that I'm going to die?

857
01:01:34,107 --> 01:01:38,111
