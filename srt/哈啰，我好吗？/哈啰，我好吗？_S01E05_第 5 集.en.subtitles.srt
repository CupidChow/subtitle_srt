00:01:02,228 --> 00:01:03,271
You can do it,

00:01:04,939 --> 00:01:05,774
Bahn Ha-ni.

00:01:09,444 --> 00:01:12,113
JOA CONFECTIONERY

5
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,369
Hello.

6
00:01:18,453 --> 00:01:22,540
I'm Bahn Ha-ni,
and today's my first day of work.

7
00:01:23,124 --> 00:01:26,377
I was told to come here
to find out where I should go.

8
00:01:26,461 --> 00:01:27,670
Just a second.

9
00:01:33,426 --> 00:01:34,719
BAHN HA-NI

10
00:01:34,803 --> 00:01:36,054
"Product Development Team"?

11
00:01:36,137 --> 00:01:38,014
Take the elevator to the sixth floor.

12
00:01:38,890 --> 00:01:39,724
Thank you.

13
00:02:05,208 --> 00:02:06,918
-I'm all done.
-Good job.

14
00:02:07,001 --> 00:02:08,795
-Thank you.
-But about this…

15
00:02:10,171 --> 00:02:12,340
"He left his current residence
in Shinjae-dong

16
00:02:12,423 --> 00:02:16,010
and had rice soup with egg for brunch.
Didn't do much in the afternoon.

17
00:02:16,094 --> 00:02:19,597
He came back outside
and had pork cutlet for dinner."

18
00:02:21,641 --> 00:02:22,809
Is there a problem?

19
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:26,771
Well, doesn't it seem like
I'm eating too well?

20
00:02:29,858 --> 00:02:32,986
Then should I change
the pork cutlet to ramyeon?

21
00:02:33,069 --> 00:02:33,903
Will you do that?

22
00:02:33,987 --> 00:02:36,948
I'll say you ate instant ramyeon
to make it seem more pitiful.

23
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:38,074
You're clever.

24
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,453
Gosh, come on. I had to compete
with 200 other applicants to get the job.

25
00:02:43,413 --> 00:02:45,290
You really are smart.

26
00:02:46,207 --> 00:02:48,793
Why don't we celebrate that
with some iced Americano?

27
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:49,961
Sure.

28
00:03:02,557 --> 00:03:03,600
Oh, gosh!

29
00:03:06,978 --> 00:03:08,146
I'm sorry.

30
00:03:10,148 --> 00:03:11,232
It's okay.

31
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:14,444
Wait…

32
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,572
BAHN HA-NI

33
00:03:33,880 --> 00:03:35,298
Oh, no.

34
00:03:41,512 --> 00:03:44,766
I accidentally bumped into a lady
on my way here.

35
00:03:47,185 --> 00:03:51,064
-I knew that was going to happen.
-Pardon?

36
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,108
What if I asked for hot coffee?
That would have been bad.

37
00:03:54,984 --> 00:03:57,987
Gosh, you're right.
You really are amazing.

38
00:03:59,656 --> 00:04:00,490
There's only half.

39
00:04:06,412 --> 00:04:08,831
There. Here you go.

40
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:11,751
You really are smart.

41
00:04:11,834 --> 00:04:14,504
Thank you. Enjoy your coffee then.

42
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,798
-You're leaving?
-Well…

43
00:04:17,298 --> 00:04:18,800
I need to give this back.

44
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:21,469
BAHN HA-NI

45
00:04:21,552 --> 00:04:22,512
It's the old lady.

46
00:04:30,937 --> 00:04:33,648
I'm sorry for being late.

47
00:04:34,565 --> 00:04:39,612
I'm Bahn Ha-ni, your new teammate.

48
00:04:46,661 --> 00:04:47,662
"Bahn Ha-ni"?

49
00:04:50,123 --> 00:04:52,667

56
00:05:51,559 --> 00:05:52,935
Ha-ni, I love you!

57
00:05:59,025 --> 00:06:02,111
You're the best, Ji-eun.

58
00:06:06,074 --> 00:06:07,909
We did great today.

59
00:06:20,171 --> 00:06:21,756
I think everyone loved it.

60
00:06:21,839 --> 00:06:23,216
We did great.

61
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:26,386
Guys, I need to take photos
for the school newspaper.

62
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:27,929
Let's start with the dance team.

63
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:31,474
In one, two…

64
00:06:32,517 --> 00:06:35,228
Ji-eun, you're not a member
of the dance team.

65
00:06:35,311 --> 00:06:36,187
What?

66
00:06:36,854 --> 00:06:38,064
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

67
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:42,944
In one, two, three.

68
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:51,994

OH JI-EUN

00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:53,371

HOSU HIGH SCHOOL

71
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:57,875
It really is her.

72
00:06:58,876 --> 00:07:00,294
Hosu High School's Lee Hyo-ri.

73
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:02,338
Bahn Ha-ni.

74
00:07:20,148 --> 00:07:21,399
Hello, everyone.

75
00:07:21,482 --> 00:07:24,235
It's time for the Joa Exercise.

76
00:07:24,318 --> 00:07:26,195
Let's all get up

77
00:07:26,279 --> 00:07:28,698
and start the day with lots of energy.

78
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:40,751
I'll call you later.

79
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:48,176
One. Two.

80
00:07:49,635 --> 00:07:51,846
Three. Four.

81
00:07:52,513 --> 00:07:56,225
Good job. One. Two.

82
00:07:57,226 --> 00:08:00,146
Three. Four.

83
00:08:00,229 --> 00:08:03,065
Faster. One, two, three, four.

84
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:04,650
One, two, three. Great.

85
00:08:05,234 --> 00:08:06,903
One, two, three, four.

86
00:08:06,986 --> 00:08:07,862
One, two...

87
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,323
I guess it really is fate.

88
00:08:10,948 --> 00:08:11,782
Two.

89
00:08:12,867 --> 00:08:14,619
-Three.
-I can't believe she's here.

90
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:16,204
Four. Good job.

91
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:17,538
One.

92
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,833
It has been sunny for days now

93
00:08:20,917 --> 00:08:24,295
and it's likely
that it won't rain this week as well.

94
00:08:24,795 --> 00:08:27,423
-My gosh.
-Today the temperature in Seoul--

95
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,635
When will it rain?

96
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:38,184
I don't need to study
and I don't have to take any tests.

97
00:08:38,267 --> 00:08:43,397
And I love that I don't have to hear
my mom nagging at me.

98
00:08:46,651 --> 00:08:49,320
But I'm bored to death.

99
00:08:50,112 --> 00:08:52,865
I also want a smartphone.

100
00:08:59,997 --> 00:09:00,957
I'm hungry.

101
00:09:06,254 --> 00:09:08,714
If you're hungry,
buy yourself a gimbap with this.

102
00:09:08,798 --> 00:09:10,758
Make sure you stay home.

103
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:14,011
I helped her get 10 million won,

104
00:09:14,512 --> 00:09:16,639
but all I get is a gimbap?

105
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,480
ORDER HERE
TOUCH THE SCREEN

106
00:09:33,864 --> 00:09:37,118
I'm sorry. You can go first.

107
00:09:39,704 --> 00:09:42,456
I see. So this is how you do it.

108
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:43,708
My gosh.

109
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,377
What a wonderful world it's become.

110
00:09:46,460 --> 00:09:48,462
Please choose what you'd like to order.

111
00:09:52,133 --> 00:09:54,093
What? A hamburger costs how much?

112
00:09:57,722 --> 00:10:00,141
"Go So-hye"? What a pretty name.

113
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:04,312
I promise I'll pay you back the rest.

114
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,358
But why aren't you at school at this hour?

115
00:10:11,902 --> 00:10:13,070
What about you?

116
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:19,285
Well, I'm sure we both have our reasons.

117
00:10:24,665 --> 00:10:27,335
By the way,
don't kids do part-time jobs these days?

118
00:10:27,918 --> 00:10:31,589
-I haven't seen any hiring ads.
-You want a part-time job?

119
00:10:41,182 --> 00:10:42,350
This is amazing.

120
00:10:42,433 --> 00:10:43,934
This is really unbelievable.

121
00:10:45,227 --> 00:10:48,147
You can even find part-time jobs
on your cell phone?

122
00:10:48,731 --> 00:10:50,900
My gosh, they pay you 10,000 won per hour?

123
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,444
I'll get rich
just by doing part-time jobs.

124
00:11:04,413 --> 00:11:05,581
What's this?

125
00:11:07,875 --> 00:11:09,960
KING STAR AGENCY
URGENTLY LOOKING FOR MODELS

126
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:33,567
Ms. Bahn.

127
00:11:33,651 --> 00:11:36,654
I heard you got an offer
to perform at Times Square, New York.

128
00:11:36,737 --> 00:11:38,823
Do you plan to start
a career in the States?

129
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:41,992
I love you, Ha-ni!

130
00:11:42,076 --> 00:11:44,328
-You're mine forever!
-No!

131
00:11:55,756 --> 00:11:56,757
What are you doing?

132
00:11:56,841 --> 00:11:59,009
Checking how long it takes
to die when shot in the heart.

133
00:11:59,093 --> 00:12:00,344
You crazy punk.

134
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:02,972
Okay, let's hit the world record.

135
00:12:03,681 --> 00:12:05,683
The world record is
2 hours and 28 seconds.

136
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,643
Then I fail.

137
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,607
Ms. Bahn, it was an honor
to work with a top celebrity like you.

138
00:12:15,317 --> 00:12:16,736
Please.

139
00:12:16,819 --> 00:12:20,030
Mr. Bodyguard, please don't die.

140
00:12:20,114 --> 00:12:22,324
I'd like to spend my last moment

141
00:12:22,408 --> 00:12:24,827
listening to "Song of Peace,"
your favorite song.

142
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,997
Please, play it for me.

143
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:03,532
BAHN HA-NI

144
00:13:05,326 --> 00:13:06,243
Kid.

145
00:13:07,745 --> 00:13:08,662
Hey, kid.

146
00:13:10,289 --> 00:13:11,165
Pardon?

147
00:13:12,291 --> 00:13:15,586
-What did you just say?
-Can you make it to the shoot this week?

148
00:13:16,670 --> 00:13:18,005
Yes, of course!

149
00:13:24,345 --> 00:13:25,930
What's my role?

150
00:13:26,013 --> 00:13:28,599
It's a minor role.
You're an extra for a snack commercial.

151
00:13:28,682 --> 00:13:29,850
"An extra"?

152
00:13:31,435 --> 00:13:33,312
I'm Hosu High School's Lee Hyo-ri.

153
00:13:35,231 --> 00:13:36,607
Forget it if you're not interested.

154
00:13:36,690 --> 00:13:39,610
The pay is 500,000 won.
We have tons of other applicants.

155
00:13:39,693 --> 00:13:41,195
I love snacks.

156
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,530
Here's one.

157
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:47,409
How about "Going bananas for a banana"?

158
00:13:48,661 --> 00:13:49,870
Isn't it catchy?

159
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:52,915
Well, I'll put it on the list.

160
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:57,962
"Going bananas for a banana."

161
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:01,799
-I guess it's not so bad.
-Right?

162
00:14:01,882 --> 00:14:06,595
Why don't we try using a cuter font?

163
00:14:07,388 --> 00:14:08,472
Okay. Just a second.

164
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:11,225
-Is everything going well?
-Hey, Ms. Oh.

165
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:13,102
-Let's get started.
-Gosh.

166
00:14:13,185 --> 00:14:15,145
Are those materials for the presentation?

167
00:14:15,229 --> 00:14:18,357
We didn't even eat lunch,
but I guess we're working overtime again.

168
00:14:18,440 --> 00:14:20,359
If you're hungry, how about some burgers?

169
00:14:20,442 --> 00:14:21,861
-Burgers?
-My gosh.

170
00:14:21,944 --> 00:14:24,864
I feel sick because we had to spend
all morning tasting snacks.

171
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,323
Who would want a burger?

172
00:14:26,907 --> 00:14:30,077
Then what was I supposed to recommend?

173
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:31,829
You're always picking fights.

174
00:14:32,496 --> 00:14:34,373
What? Are you serious right now?

175
00:14:34,456 --> 00:14:36,041
Gosh, I've had enough of you two.

176
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:40,004
Then let's order what you like.
How about tteokbokki?

177
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,673
-There's a famous place nearby.
-They don't do deliveries.

178
00:14:43,257 --> 00:14:46,093
-Oh, darn it.
-Why don't I go buy it?

179
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:49,513
Will you do that for us?

180
00:14:50,097 --> 00:14:51,140
-Sure.
-Okay.

181
00:14:51,223 --> 00:14:53,350
Wait. You can pay with this.

182
00:14:53,434 --> 00:14:55,144
I see. Okay.

183
00:14:56,186 --> 00:14:58,105
What should I buy?

184
00:14:58,188 --> 00:15:01,233
Tteokbokki, fritters, and sundae.

185
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:03,861
Just get a combination of everything.

186
00:15:03,944 --> 00:15:08,115
When I order sundae,
should I ask them for other stuff

187
00:15:08,198 --> 00:15:10,784
like liver, lungs, and stomach?

188
00:15:11,702 --> 00:15:14,079
-Sure. Whatever.
-Just buy whatever you want.

189
00:15:14,663 --> 00:15:17,041
I see. "Buy whatever."

190
00:15:19,168 --> 00:15:20,294
And one more thing.

191
00:15:21,253 --> 00:15:22,421
The fritters.

192
00:15:23,505 --> 00:15:26,425
Do you want them covered
in tteokbokki sauce?

193
00:15:26,508 --> 00:15:28,928
Or do you want them nice and crispy?

194
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:33,432
She really cares about the details.
Anything will do.

195
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:34,850
-You can choose.
-Okay.

196
00:15:35,643 --> 00:15:36,852
I'll be right back.

197
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:50,783
My goodness, look at him.

198
00:15:50,866 --> 00:15:53,243
I'm doing this because my eyes hurt.

199
00:15:54,411 --> 00:15:57,164
Did they bring a bag of beans
along with the onions?

200
00:15:57,247 --> 00:15:59,500
I put all the ingredients inside.

201
00:16:00,417 --> 00:16:02,586
-I didn't see any beans.
-I wouldn't know.

202
00:16:02,670 --> 00:16:05,339
Maybe they ran away.

203
00:16:07,758 --> 00:16:09,301
Is that supposed to be a joke?

204
00:16:09,385 --> 00:16:10,427
My gosh.

205
00:16:11,762 --> 00:16:13,931
Go find the beans.

206
00:16:15,641 --> 00:16:17,935
-You're doing great.
-Go find them!

207
00:16:24,900 --> 00:16:26,276
Darn it.

208
00:16:28,028 --> 00:16:30,739
Working in the kitchen
is a lot harder than I thought.

209
00:16:33,575 --> 00:16:34,535
My gosh.

210
00:16:59,393 --> 00:17:00,936
-No!
-Are you okay?

211
00:17:01,020 --> 00:17:02,396
No!

212
00:17:09,737 --> 00:17:10,946
Old Lady.

213
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:18,871
I actually have something for you.

214
00:17:19,496 --> 00:17:20,914
Oh, I left it in the kitchen.

215
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,459
What are you even doing here?

216
00:17:23,542 --> 00:17:25,919
I work at Joa Confectionery.

217
00:17:26,003 --> 00:17:29,006
We're colleagues. It really must be fate.

218
00:17:29,590 --> 00:17:30,632
It's a coincidence.

219
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:33,385
No. We're ill-fated.

220
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,516
I'll pay for the tteokbokki.

221
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,519
It's not an ill-fated relationship.

222
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:44,563
Can I…

223
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:48,275
Wait. Are you sold out already?

224
00:17:48,358 --> 00:17:51,487
-Yes, I used up all the ingredients I had.
-Oh, no.

225
00:17:52,529 --> 00:17:53,989
What now?

226
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:57,284
You ruined my first day at work!

227
00:18:00,412 --> 00:18:03,499
I'm walking on eggshells
over there as is, you know.

228
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:07,586
-Ma'am, can I have a taste?
-Sure.

229
00:18:15,844 --> 00:18:17,304
I got it. Let's head back now.

230
00:18:28,315 --> 00:18:29,608
I'm sorry.

231
00:18:30,567 --> 00:18:34,780
It's not like I ordered you
to make the rice cakes from scratch.

232
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:38,033
Even a child wouldn't mess up
a simple order like this.

233
00:18:40,494 --> 00:18:43,622
We can't sit around
and skip our meal all together,

234
00:18:43,705 --> 00:18:47,084
so let's get some sandwiches or some cake.

235
00:18:47,167 --> 00:18:48,752
-I'll--
-No.

236
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:50,963
Let me.

237
00:18:51,046 --> 00:18:52,673
-Wait.
-Stop her.

238
00:18:54,258 --> 00:18:56,593
What the hell? How did you get in here?

239
00:18:58,679 --> 00:18:59,721
Here's your tteokbokki.

240
00:19:12,109 --> 00:19:13,694
What's he up to?

241
00:19:14,319 --> 00:19:15,946
He seems to be making tteokbokki.

242
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:18,115
But I told him to fetch the beans.

243
00:19:18,198 --> 00:19:20,909
It's not strange for him
to go off the rails like that.

244
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,912
But he needs to peel the onions too.

245
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,039
He already finished that.

246
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:28,500
You have no idea how fast he works.

247
00:19:29,918 --> 00:19:32,504
Who on earth is he really?

248
00:19:40,429 --> 00:19:42,472
-What the…
-Hi.

249
00:19:42,556 --> 00:19:46,059
I ruined her tteokbokki, you see.
I'm sorry I'm late.

250
00:19:48,520 --> 00:19:51,857
Gosh, look at this. It smells incredible.

251
00:19:54,735 --> 00:19:56,028
-Goodness.
-Take a whiff.

252
00:19:56,653 --> 00:19:57,529
It's delicious.

253
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:02,534
It tastes the same.

254
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:06,663
-Did you make this yourself?
-Well, I tried recreating the dish.

255
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:11,543
If you want, I'll make
the rice cakes myself next time,

256
00:20:11,627 --> 00:20:13,253
so don't be too harsh on her.

257
00:20:13,837 --> 00:20:16,548
What? I wasn't scolding her.

258
00:20:17,174 --> 00:20:18,050
Enjoy.

259
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,847
You sure are clumsy, aren't you?

260
00:20:25,891 --> 00:20:26,934
BAHN HA-NI

261
00:20:27,684 --> 00:20:28,936
I'll catch you later.

262
00:20:39,112 --> 00:20:39,947
It's good.

263
00:20:40,447 --> 00:20:41,907
Ms. Bahn.

264
00:20:42,491 --> 00:20:44,034
We should talk.

265
00:20:44,785 --> 00:20:45,619
Sure.

266
00:21:04,638 --> 00:21:05,973
The door is open.

267
00:21:39,381 --> 00:21:41,008
Wait. Hold on.

268
00:21:42,926 --> 00:21:44,594
-Yes?
-That…

269
00:21:46,513 --> 00:21:47,806
I think that's mine.

270
00:21:49,766 --> 00:21:51,977
CHAE SEONG-U

271
00:21:59,818 --> 00:22:02,029
Actually, Chae Seong-u is my name.

272
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:07,951
Thank you.

273
00:22:21,631 --> 00:22:23,508
You've changed a lot.

274
00:22:24,593 --> 00:22:26,595
You were the Lee Hyo-ri
of our high school.

275
00:22:28,555 --> 00:22:29,890
Do you know me?

276
00:22:30,557 --> 00:22:31,850
Don't you recognize me?

277
00:22:33,268 --> 00:22:35,312
-No, I don't.
-Of course.

278
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:38,148
I've changed a lot myself.

279
00:22:40,650 --> 00:22:41,651
I'm…

280
00:22:45,864 --> 00:22:46,907
Oh Ji-eun.

281
00:22:50,452 --> 00:22:51,870
-Oh Ji-eun?
-Yes.

282
00:22:52,996 --> 00:22:54,289
Ji-eun!

283
00:22:56,166 --> 00:22:57,793
Gosh, it's been so long.

284
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:01,505
Have you been well?

285
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:03,590
Yes, as you can see.

286
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:06,885
You know,

287
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:10,889
I've always wanted to apologize
if I ever got to see you again.

288
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:11,973
No, don't.

289
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,143
Let's not dredge up our shabby past.
I don't even remember it.

290
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:22,609
You look incredible.

291
00:23:22,692 --> 00:23:25,112
Had you not told me,
I wouldn't have known.

292
00:23:25,946 --> 00:23:27,072
Likewise.

293
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:31,034
I still can't believe who I'm seeing.

294
00:23:31,743 --> 00:23:35,080
This is what happened
to the great Bahn Ha-ni.

295
00:23:41,253 --> 00:23:45,465
Anyway, how do you know
that cook from earlier?

296
00:23:45,549 --> 00:23:49,010
Oh, him. It's a long story.

297
00:23:49,511 --> 00:23:53,890
To put it short, I lent him some money.

298
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:56,643
You lent him money?

299
00:23:56,726 --> 00:23:57,769
Yes.

300
00:23:58,603 --> 00:23:59,563
Money...

301
00:23:59,646 --> 00:24:01,398
Why do you ask?

302
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,067
Oh, it's nothing.

303
00:24:05,652 --> 00:24:09,614
Anyway, I had no idea
we'd meet again like this.

304
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:13,368
It's great to see you again
after all these years...

305
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:15,245
-Bahn Ha-ni.
-Same here.

306
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:19,040
I was a nervous wreck
with this being my first day and all.

307
00:24:19,624 --> 00:24:21,376
I hope we get along, Ji-eun.

308
00:24:21,460 --> 00:24:22,461
Right.

309
00:24:25,589 --> 00:24:28,258
Right, of course. If you need help,

310
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:29,885
feel free to ask me.

311
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,388
But since we're at a workplace,

312
00:24:33,472 --> 00:24:35,599
let's keep our personal lives separate.

313
00:24:36,308 --> 00:24:39,478
The other employees might find
our relationship uncomfortable.

314
00:24:40,479 --> 00:24:42,481
You know what I mean, right?

315
00:24:42,564 --> 00:24:46,485
Yes, of course. Right. Sorry about that.

316
00:24:51,031 --> 00:24:53,825
-Go ahead and take the call.
-Then…

317
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,120
-Will you excuse me?
-Sure.

318
00:24:57,704 --> 00:24:59,164
You didn't have to walk away.

319
00:25:01,291 --> 00:25:03,668
Could Yu-hyeon have asked the chairman

320
00:25:03,752 --> 00:25:06,421
for a favor since he owes her?

321
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:10,884
Anyway, Ji-eun.
You were the coolest just now.

322
00:25:13,428 --> 00:25:17,849
You said just now to ask you

323
00:25:17,933 --> 00:25:19,851
if I needed anything.

324
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,603
Sure. What is it?

325
00:25:23,855 --> 00:25:25,440
I need to take the afternoon off.

326
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:27,692
What?

327
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:40,413
I was asked to come down here.

328
00:25:41,081 --> 00:25:42,082
Auntie.

329
00:25:43,625 --> 00:25:45,710
My gosh, Seong-u.

330
00:25:46,294 --> 00:25:49,256
This girl says she entered
Ms. Bahn's house on your request.

331
00:25:49,339 --> 00:25:50,674
I need you to verify that.

332
00:25:51,299 --> 00:25:54,177
Auntie, why was she stealing
from our house?

333
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,390
Her?

334
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,893
She's the niece
of my friend's sister, you see. 

335
00:26:02,477 --> 00:26:05,105
Her Korean isn't as good
since she grew up in the States.

336
00:26:05,188 --> 00:26:08,567
-She must've misunderstood me.
-Her Korean seems fine to me.

337
00:26:08,650 --> 00:26:11,987
She called me a brat and an imbecile.

338
00:26:18,743 --> 00:26:19,828
That's--

339
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,663
Seong-u, wait for me outside.

340
00:26:23,164 --> 00:26:25,500
-Mom?
-Wait for me in my car!

341
00:26:26,459 --> 00:26:27,294
Sure.

342
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:33,008
Ha-yeong.

343
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:35,760
Hi, there.

344
00:26:36,595 --> 00:26:37,554
Leave that here.

345
00:26:41,057 --> 00:26:41,933
We should talk.

346
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:51,067
Are you kidding me?

347
00:26:55,030 --> 00:26:56,573
I'm sorry, Ha-yeong.

348
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,366
You're sorry?

349
00:26:58,450 --> 00:26:59,993
Is that all you can say?

350
00:27:00,076 --> 00:27:02,245
How much more do I need to suffer?

351
00:27:02,329 --> 00:27:03,663
How much more

352
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,249
must I endure your shenanigans?

353
00:27:07,292 --> 00:27:10,211
Haven't you done enough
by taking Dad away from me?

354
00:27:12,922 --> 00:27:14,007
Ha-yeong…

355
00:27:14,090 --> 00:27:16,551
Because of my selfish sister,

356
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:19,554
I haven't been able to say the word "Dad"

357
00:27:20,263 --> 00:27:22,057
for the past 20 years.

358
00:27:25,060 --> 00:27:28,396
I thought it'd get better
once I got older and became a mom,

359
00:27:29,773 --> 00:27:32,233
but I still miss him like crazy.

360
00:27:32,776 --> 00:27:34,069
Just once,

361
00:27:35,612 --> 00:27:37,489
I want to hold his hand,

362
00:27:38,281 --> 00:27:39,366
hug him,

363
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:42,077
and hear his voice.

364
00:27:45,121 --> 00:27:45,997
I'm sorry.

365
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:51,044
I'm sorry, Ha-yeong.

366
00:27:51,628 --> 00:27:53,797
If you're really sorry,
stay out of my life.

367
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:59,052
The sight of you and your daughter
who's the spitting image of you

368
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:01,304
gives me the creeps.

369
00:28:12,482 --> 00:28:13,566
I'm sorry…

370
00:28:16,569 --> 00:28:17,612
Ha-yeong.

371
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:25,370
What is it?

372
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,205
So-hye did what?

373
00:28:27,288 --> 00:28:29,374
CHIEF GO JEONG-DO

374
00:28:29,457 --> 00:28:31,501
Okay, I got it.

375
00:28:31,584 --> 00:28:33,920
I'll tell her off once I get home.

376
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:36,923
Okay. Sure thing.

377
00:28:38,216 --> 00:28:40,301
Why? Is something up at home?

378
00:28:40,385 --> 00:28:43,054
My daughter's giving me a headache.

379
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:45,473
She skipped the academy today

380
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,434
and she still isn't home.

381
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,729
-She's in tenth grade, isn't she?
-Yes.

382
00:28:50,812 --> 00:28:54,524
Kids her age
love spending time with friends.

383
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,775
Yes, of course.

384
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:57,485
Ms. Oh.

385
00:28:57,986 --> 00:29:01,489
What were you like in high school?
I bet you were popular.

386
00:29:01,573 --> 00:29:04,159
Unbelievable. What a waste of a question.

387
00:29:04,242 --> 00:29:06,327
Isn't it obvious?

388
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:07,829
She's pretty and smart.

389
00:29:07,912 --> 00:29:10,999
Unlike someone,
boys would've lined up to see her.

390
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:12,625
She must've been a queen bee.

391
00:29:17,672 --> 00:29:20,049
Well, you know…

392
00:29:21,092 --> 00:29:24,429
Didn't Ms. Bahn cross the line
on her first day?

393
00:29:24,512 --> 00:29:26,973
She was late, messed up our lunch,
and took the afternoon off.

394
00:29:27,056 --> 00:29:30,018
Tell me about it.
Who could've got her this job?

395
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:32,604
Maybe she's
the chairman's secret daughter.

396
00:29:32,687 --> 00:29:34,022
Yong-hwa!

397
00:29:36,191 --> 00:29:38,318
-Sorry about that.
-It's all right.

398
00:29:40,028 --> 00:29:43,990
You all did a great job today
despite not getting to eat dinner yet.

399
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:44,949
It's nothing.

400
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:48,244
I'll set my phone on mute,

401
00:29:48,328 --> 00:29:50,622
so treat yourselves to anything
and have fun.

402
00:29:51,372 --> 00:29:54,459
-No way.
-Ms. Oh, you're the best!

403
00:29:54,542 --> 00:29:56,628
I'll get going first,
so hurry home as well.

404
00:29:56,711 --> 00:29:57,879
-Right.
-Good night.

405
00:29:57,962 --> 00:30:00,215
-Ms. Oh!
-Ms. Oh!

406
00:30:00,298 --> 00:30:01,966
-Please don't.
-Ms. Oh!

407
00:30:02,050 --> 00:30:04,803
-Ms. Oh!
-We love you, Ms. Oh!

408
00:30:14,854 --> 00:30:16,981
What were you like in high school?

409
00:30:17,065 --> 00:30:19,526
-I bet you were popular.
-She's pretty and smart.

410
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:22,654
Unlike someone,
boys would've lined up to see her.

411
00:30:22,737 --> 00:30:24,405
She must've been a queen bee.

412
00:30:24,489 --> 00:30:26,950
Ji-eun, you're not a member
of the dance team.

413
00:30:27,033 --> 00:30:27,909
What?

414
00:30:28,576 --> 00:30:29,786
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

415
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:32,997
I told you to bring Ha-ni,

416
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:35,041
not her little minion! Damn it!

417
00:30:41,548 --> 00:30:43,675
PURPLE KARAOKE

418
00:30:43,758 --> 00:30:50,265
It's time you became my love

419
00:30:50,849 --> 00:30:57,063
I wish to depend on you in every way

420
00:30:57,146 --> 00:31:04,028
You will forever be my guardian angel

421
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:09,826
That you'll dearly love only me

422
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:14,622
Promise me

423
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:38,396
Hey!

424
00:31:40,356 --> 00:31:41,816
I told you not to bring that.

425
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,987
But Bald Eagle said that you can keep it.

426
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:49,616
Besides, it's a waste
to just throw them away.

427
00:31:49,699 --> 00:31:51,326
Where is your love for the environment?

428
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:55,038
-Why on earth did you steal her clothes?
-I need pretty clothes for the shoot--

429
00:31:56,039 --> 00:31:57,582
What? A shoot?

430
00:31:57,665 --> 00:32:00,627
Gosh, what I meant was…

431
00:32:00,710 --> 00:32:03,713
You barely have clothes
that are fit for the office.

432
00:32:03,796 --> 00:32:05,840
I never asked you to do this.

433
00:32:05,924 --> 00:32:08,843
Also, I told you
not to wander around on your own.

434
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:11,804
Why should I stay confined
like a prisoner?

435
00:32:12,722 --> 00:32:14,724
Just wait until I get back.

436
00:32:15,558 --> 00:32:18,227
Bald Eagle will pay
for how she treated me here.

437
00:32:18,311 --> 00:32:21,814
I'm begging you not to do anything.

438
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:26,069
In this timeline
and even in yours, just stay put.

439
00:32:41,501 --> 00:32:43,044
Look how pretty this is.

440
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:46,673
Would you like to wear it
to work tomorrow?

441
00:33:10,947 --> 00:33:13,992
When you're feeling down and frustrated

442
00:33:14,075 --> 00:33:16,452
Head up the mountain and scream

443
00:33:16,536 --> 00:33:18,663
Keep it down, will you?

444
00:33:18,746 --> 00:33:19,580
Gosh.

445
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,958
Why on earth are you yelling?

446
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:25,545
I told you earlier

447
00:33:26,796 --> 00:33:28,631
not to do anything.

448
00:33:31,926 --> 00:33:33,011
Ha-ni, the table's set.

449
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,514
Dad, I was in the middle of recording!

450
00:33:36,597 --> 00:33:38,057
Gosh, I'm sorry.

451
00:33:39,934 --> 00:33:43,563
This is the song
I listen to all the time in my cab.

452
00:33:44,063 --> 00:33:46,858
When you're feeling down
Just sing like me

453
00:33:46,941 --> 00:33:49,068
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

454
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:54,574
Dad, are you tone-deaf?
You're a terrible singer.

455
00:33:54,657 --> 00:33:56,367
Who are you calling tone-deaf?

456
00:33:56,451 --> 00:33:58,703
I sound better than them, don't I?

457
00:33:58,786 --> 00:34:01,205
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

458
00:34:03,207 --> 00:34:04,834
That's awful!

459
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,753
Come on, Ha-ni. Sing with me.

460
00:34:06,836 --> 00:34:10,048
Just like me
Stretch out your chest and go

461
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:12,467
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

462
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:15,887
Dad, you're doing it all wrong.

463
00:34:15,970 --> 00:34:17,430
-Then?
-Repeat after me.

464
00:34:17,513 --> 00:34:18,347
Sure.

465
00:34:19,474 --> 00:34:22,685
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

466
00:34:22,769 --> 00:34:25,855
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

467
00:34:25,938 --> 00:34:28,816
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

468
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,986
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

469
00:34:32,987 --> 00:34:34,405
That's awful!

470
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,115
Let's sing it once more.

471
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,743
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

472
00:34:38,826 --> 00:34:42,288
Ba ba ba ba ba, ba ba ba

473
00:34:53,091 --> 00:34:54,175
Where are you off to?

474
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:56,094
To buy some beer.

475
00:34:59,305 --> 00:35:01,099
But there's plenty in the fridge.

476
00:35:18,950 --> 00:35:19,784
Ha-ni!

477
00:35:21,285 --> 00:35:23,621
Wait up! Let's talk!

478
00:35:24,413 --> 00:35:25,498
Ha-ni, wait up!

479
00:35:26,958 --> 00:35:29,669
Don't stop me. I'm going to audition.

480
00:35:30,211 --> 00:35:33,339
You promised to back me up yesterday!

481
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:36,843
Ha-ni, watch out!

482
00:35:50,356 --> 00:35:51,649
Ha-ni!

483
00:36:49,790 --> 00:36:53,169
Haven't you done enough
by taking Dad away from me?

484
00:36:55,838 --> 00:36:58,549
I still miss him like crazy.

485
00:37:15,399 --> 00:37:16,943
Me too.

486
00:37:19,779 --> 00:37:22,573
I miss Dad too.

487
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:38,214
What kind of Superman cries so sadly?

488
00:37:50,434 --> 00:37:52,353
What a bizarre fate you have.

489
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,689
Do I have bad luck?

490
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:59,944
You will have plenty of wealth
until the day you die.

491
00:38:00,027 --> 00:38:02,154
But your fame has ended already.

492
00:38:03,698 --> 00:38:06,617
Then what about Ms. Kim's drama?

493
00:38:06,701 --> 00:38:10,037
Judging by this reading,
it has fallen through.

494
00:38:12,039 --> 00:38:14,375
Sir, is there anything we can do about it?

495
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:17,086
Perhaps, a talisman or some other--

496
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:22,258
You fool. Do you expect to change
one's fate with a piece of paper?

497
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:26,053
Your best bet

498
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:29,181
is to perform a rite.

499
00:38:30,850 --> 00:38:32,727
"A rite"? How much is it?

500
00:38:35,354 --> 00:38:38,983
Usually, I'd charge
at least 100 million won.

501
00:38:40,609 --> 00:38:42,528
-A hundred million?
-A hundred million?

502
00:38:42,611 --> 00:38:44,613
You're not going to fool us, you quack.

503
00:38:44,697 --> 00:38:47,742
"Quack"? I may look like this,
but I majored in engineering.

504
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:52,621
Hold on.
Do you give discounts to celebrities?

505
00:38:52,705 --> 00:38:55,166
That's absurd.
Let's not waste our time and just go.

506
00:38:57,043 --> 00:38:59,337
You only started this because of a girl,

507
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:01,088
so why are you so attached?

508
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:07,845
-What did you say?
-What's wrong?

509
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:12,183
Have you become too avaricious
and forgot your past?

510
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,813
God, he's such a nuisance.

511
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:18,731
Sir.

512
00:39:20,775 --> 00:39:23,235
-Sir.
-Hey, let go. Let me go.

513
00:39:23,319 --> 00:39:27,073
I'll give you some advice out of pity
since you come every day.

514
00:39:27,156 --> 00:39:29,408
Let's be frank.
Not everyone can become a star.

515
00:39:29,492 --> 00:39:31,786
-Your looks matter greatly.
-I need to do this.

516
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:35,289
Everyone says that,
but it's easier said than done.

517
00:39:35,373 --> 00:39:37,291
I need to find someone.

518
00:39:37,375 --> 00:39:39,418
Then go to a detective agency, not here.

519
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,046
If I become a star,
I could go on TV Loaded With Love.

520
00:39:42,129 --> 00:39:44,465
They can find anyone I want to look for.

521
00:39:46,133 --> 00:39:47,927
That's why I need to do this.

522
00:39:57,353 --> 00:39:59,939
Why didn't he look for her
once he became a star?

523
00:40:00,439 --> 00:40:02,691
He was about to,

524
00:40:03,192 --> 00:40:04,985
but then the show was canceled.

525
00:40:05,528 --> 00:40:07,488
Isn't it back on now?

526
00:40:07,571 --> 00:40:10,825
He went on a power trip,
so the producer blacklisted him.

527
00:40:11,617 --> 00:40:15,037
Afterward, he became a top star
and had a hectic schedule.

528
00:40:15,621 --> 00:40:17,123
He gradually forgot about her.

529
00:40:17,790 --> 00:40:20,376
Who was this woman
he was desperate to find?

530
00:40:22,586 --> 00:40:23,879
His first love.

531
00:40:25,589 --> 00:40:26,715
"First love…"

532
00:40:35,433 --> 00:40:36,434
Sleeping already?

533
00:40:37,768 --> 00:40:39,979
Don't you know something
called beauty sleep?

534
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:49,864
You're so carefree,

535
00:40:50,573 --> 00:40:53,075
seeing how you can sleep
after what you've done.

536
00:40:53,159 --> 00:40:55,411
I'm sleepy. Don't talk to me.

537
00:41:20,436 --> 00:41:22,146
What are those?

538
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,401
Do you remember those?
Glow-in-the-dark stickers.

539
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:33,073
I used to have those on my ceiling
when I was young.

540
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:34,658
You do remember.

541
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:46,086
To be honest, I turned on
your favorite song to cheer you up.

542
00:41:46,170 --> 00:41:47,880
I didn't think you'd get so upset.

543
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,758
So I gave it some thought.

544
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:54,512
"What else could possibly cheer me up?"

545
00:41:57,389 --> 00:42:01,644
Remember how ecstatic you were
after sticking them on the ceiling?

546
00:42:02,436 --> 00:42:04,813
You'd always have good dreams.

547
00:42:13,030 --> 00:42:15,241
What's wrong? Do you not like them either?

548
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:18,369
I do.

549
00:42:23,999 --> 00:42:25,042
They're pretty.

550
00:42:29,922 --> 00:42:32,258
Among all those countless stars,

551
00:42:34,134 --> 00:42:37,846
where could Dad be?

552
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:42,059
Would he be happy

553
00:42:43,477 --> 00:42:45,312
with how I've turned out?

554
00:42:50,025 --> 00:42:51,193
Thank you,

555
00:42:52,611 --> 00:42:53,612
Bahn Ha-ni.

556
00:43:10,045 --> 00:43:13,632
Come on. Why are you yawning?

557
00:43:13,716 --> 00:43:15,050
Did you not sleep well?

558
00:43:15,134 --> 00:43:17,469
I just lost sleep over something.

559
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,514
It's obviously related to a woman.

560
00:43:21,348 --> 00:43:23,100
No. It's not like that.

561
00:43:27,646 --> 00:43:30,316
But whenever I think about that old lady,

562
00:43:32,568 --> 00:43:33,527
I feel bad.

563
00:43:34,445 --> 00:43:37,197
"Old lady"? Is she old?

564
00:43:37,281 --> 00:43:38,949
Yes, she even has a kid.

565
00:43:40,576 --> 00:43:41,869
A kid?

566
00:43:43,162 --> 00:43:47,207
Could she be nearby?

567
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,834
Yes, she works here.

568
00:43:50,085 --> 00:43:52,963
Ma'am, are you okay?

569
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:57,718
You must be tired as well.
I'll go out and buy some coffee.

570
00:43:58,260 --> 00:43:59,553
All right.

571
00:44:00,054 --> 00:44:02,681
Oh, right. I have something for you guys.

572
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,288
Miss.

573
00:44:27,331 --> 00:44:28,791
Hello, sir.

574
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:31,085
What were you staring at?

575
00:44:31,877 --> 00:44:34,630
The snacks in the front row.

576
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:38,133
These are the most popular snacks.

577
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:42,137
The more recent the manufactured date,
the more popular the snack is.

578
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,431
You know so much.

579
00:44:44,515 --> 00:44:46,642
I learned this working at the supermarket.

580
00:44:47,184 --> 00:44:50,646
Right. Just like you said,
I have good news.

581
00:44:51,605 --> 00:44:54,441
I got a job
at Joa Confectionery headquarters.

582
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:56,360
Oh, my! Congratulations.

583
00:44:57,653 --> 00:44:58,612
That's great news.

584
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,075
But I've only inconvenienced
the team until now.

585
00:45:03,158 --> 00:45:05,786
I don't know what to do.

586
00:45:05,869 --> 00:45:07,246
That's fine.

587
00:45:07,329 --> 00:45:11,500
Take the bull by the horns
like you always have.

588
00:45:13,669 --> 00:45:16,296
I won't give up.
I'll put my heart into it.

589
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,384
Hey, old lady.

590
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,678
What? Why are you guys together?

591
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:25,931
Do you know him?

592
00:45:27,307 --> 00:45:29,643
Of course, I do.

593
00:45:29,727 --> 00:45:31,854
Do you not know him?

594
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,064
He's…

595
00:45:40,696 --> 00:45:42,740
Goodbye, sir.

596
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,657
Goodbye.

597
00:45:48,996 --> 00:45:50,038
What did you tell her?

598
00:45:50,122 --> 00:45:52,958
That you're actually senile
even though you don't look like it.

599
00:45:53,584 --> 00:45:55,711
I told her to be careful
since you could rob her.

600
00:45:55,794 --> 00:45:57,796
-How dare you?
-What?

601
00:45:57,880 --> 00:46:00,299
Hold on. How do you know her?

602
00:46:01,216 --> 00:46:03,635
She obviously doesn't know
that you're the chairman.

603
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:06,054
That's none of your business.

604
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,933
Pretend you don't know me
even if you run into me at work.

605
00:46:12,311 --> 00:46:13,979
That's exactly what I want to do.

606
00:46:15,439 --> 00:46:16,440
Goodbye.

607
00:46:27,576 --> 00:46:29,161
You're holding out pretty well.

608
00:46:29,661 --> 00:46:32,122
I thought you'd get sick of it
and quit soon.

609
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:35,375
Well, I didn't like it at first.

610
00:46:38,420 --> 00:46:41,173
-But things got pretty interesting.
-How so?

611
00:46:42,132 --> 00:46:44,343
Are you curious? Are you?

612
00:46:46,094 --> 00:46:48,472
-Then will you buy this?
-Forget it. I'm not curious.

613
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,681
Then forget it.

614
00:46:50,265 --> 00:46:51,391
Goodbye.

615
00:47:33,058 --> 00:47:34,017
Ms. Bahn.

616
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,019
What are you doing?

617
00:47:36,103 --> 00:47:37,646
-Good morning.
-Good Morning.

618
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:41,859
I wanted to be of help,

619
00:47:41,942 --> 00:47:44,987
but I didn't know what to do.

620
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:48,949
So I thought I'd clean up to cheer you up.

621
00:47:49,032 --> 00:47:49,867
I see.

622
00:47:49,950 --> 00:47:53,370
We have cleaners for that.

623
00:47:53,453 --> 00:47:55,497
I see.

624
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,249
-Then--
-Hello.

625
00:47:57,332 --> 00:47:59,251
I'll make five cups of coffee.

626
00:47:59,334 --> 00:48:03,213
No. We stay away from strong beverages
for product tasting in the mornings.

627
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,216
I see. I'm sorry.

628
00:48:07,259 --> 00:48:11,889
Then just let me know
if you need anything.

629
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:13,098
-Sure.
-Okay.

630
00:48:27,487 --> 00:48:28,405
JOA EXERCISE

631
00:48:29,740 --> 00:48:30,782
Good morning.

632
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:34,077
-Hello, ma'am.
-Hello, ma'am.

633
00:48:34,703 --> 00:48:36,538
Yes. Hello.

634
00:48:47,591 --> 00:48:51,887
Hello, everyone.
It's time for the Joa Exercise.

635
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:56,099
Let's all get up
and start the day with lots of energy.

636
00:49:02,773 --> 00:49:03,982
What?

637
00:49:05,692 --> 00:49:07,402
-What?
-What?

638
00:49:07,903 --> 00:49:08,946
Did she practice?

639
00:49:11,448 --> 00:49:13,742
Dance start. One.

640
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:15,994
Two.

641
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:17,746
Three.

642
00:49:18,872 --> 00:49:20,666
Four. Good job.

643
00:49:20,749 --> 00:49:21,750
One.

644
00:49:22,876 --> 00:49:23,710
Two.

645
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:25,420
-How did she get so good?
-Three.

646
00:49:26,380 --> 00:49:28,465
-Four. Faster.
-Is that even possible?

647
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,342
One, two, three, four.

648
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:32,135
One, two. Good.

649
00:49:32,219 --> 00:49:34,179
One, two, three, four.

650
00:49:34,262 --> 00:49:36,014
One, two. Good job.

651
00:49:36,098 --> 00:49:37,015
One.

652
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:39,101
Two.

653
00:49:40,143 --> 00:49:41,103
Three.

654
00:49:42,062 --> 00:49:43,939
Four. That's good.

655
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:44,856
One.

656
00:49:45,941 --> 00:49:46,775
Two.

657
00:49:47,567 --> 00:49:48,485
Three.

658
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:52,114
Four. Faster again.

659
00:49:52,197 --> 00:49:55,200
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

660
00:49:55,826 --> 00:49:59,538
One, two, three, four.
One, two. Slow down again.

661
00:49:59,621 --> 00:50:00,622
One.

662
00:50:01,373 --> 00:50:03,208
-Two.
-Did you teach her?

663
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:04,918
-No, it wasn't me.
-Three.

664
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,086
Four.

665
00:50:07,087 --> 00:50:10,799
One, two, three, four.
One, two. That's good.

666
00:50:10,882 --> 00:50:14,845
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

667
00:50:26,732 --> 00:50:28,984
Today is the day of my debut.

668
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,280
By the way,

669
00:50:34,573 --> 00:50:37,784
I wouldn't run into Ha-ni here, would I?

670
00:50:44,416 --> 00:50:45,250
Who's that?

671
00:50:46,209 --> 00:50:47,085
A celebrity?

672
00:50:55,677 --> 00:50:56,845
Why are we here?

673
00:50:58,722 --> 00:51:00,265
Anthony, you see--

674
00:51:00,348 --> 00:51:02,601
This isn't a photoshoot.

675
00:51:02,684 --> 00:51:04,436
It's an ad for Joa Confectionary.

676
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,981
-Actually--
-Do I look like a fool to you?

677
00:51:08,565 --> 00:51:11,026
Are you kidding me? I'm Anthony.

678
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:12,486
That's who I am.

679
00:51:13,111 --> 00:51:14,613
I--

680
00:51:14,696 --> 00:51:15,697
Holy crap.

681
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,492
Who is she? Get rid of her.

682
00:51:18,575 --> 00:51:20,744
-Sorry. Gyeong-sik, hurry.
-Okay.

683
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:23,497
Hey, kid.

684
00:51:24,289 --> 00:51:26,708
Sir, is there a celebrity in here?
Who is it?

685
00:51:26,792 --> 00:51:29,086
That's none of your business.
Just go, kid.

686
00:51:31,671 --> 00:51:33,215
I'm not a kid.

687
00:51:33,298 --> 00:51:35,634
I'm also going to become a star soon.

688
00:51:35,717 --> 00:51:36,760
As if.

689
00:51:39,221 --> 00:51:42,474
JOA CONFECTIONERY

690
00:51:42,557 --> 00:51:43,809
Who was that?

691
00:51:44,309 --> 00:51:46,061
She says she's going to be a star.

692
00:51:59,866 --> 00:52:02,160
I'm only doing this

693
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:05,122
because I need to behave
until Ms. Kim finalizes the cast.

694
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:07,290
Thank you, Anthony.

695
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:10,627
You're just as considerate
as you are handsome.

696
00:52:10,710 --> 00:52:12,379
You're the best of the best.

697
00:52:13,213 --> 00:52:14,047
Damn it.

698
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:21,763
He's so handsome.

699
00:52:21,847 --> 00:52:24,015
Look at him scooping.
His arms are so muscular.

700
00:52:24,099 --> 00:52:25,559
I'm full just by looking at him.

701
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:29,437
How is he so handsome?
He's so good-looking.

702
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:34,693
Could you give me
a bit more stir-fried spicy pork?

703
00:52:34,776 --> 00:52:36,361
No. You all get the same amount.

704
00:52:36,444 --> 00:52:39,447
Then could you give me more lettuce?

705
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:41,408
You only get five pieces.

706
00:52:43,577 --> 00:52:44,786
Look at his shoulders.

707
00:52:45,704 --> 00:52:50,041
Ms. Bang, so this is why you insisted
on coming here to eat.

708
00:52:50,125 --> 00:52:53,336
You fall for every guy
who's even the slightest bit good-looking.

709
00:52:53,420 --> 00:52:57,299
That's why I will never fall
for your pitiful looks,

710
00:52:57,382 --> 00:52:58,967
so don't you worry.

711
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:00,969
What's wrong with my face?

712
00:53:01,052 --> 00:53:02,637
-Want me to show you?
-Sure.

713
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:03,930
-What's wrong?
-Here.

714
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,557
-Look.
-Are you Tom and Jerry?

715
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:07,726
You always bicker. Let's eat first.

716
00:53:12,898 --> 00:53:14,983
Hey! We meet again.

717
00:53:15,066 --> 00:53:17,277
Aren't you happy to run into me here?

718
00:53:17,861 --> 00:53:19,863
Not really.

719
00:53:21,364 --> 00:53:24,868
You should have meat
when going through a rough patch.

720
00:53:27,287 --> 00:53:29,164
No. That's okay.

721
00:53:31,333 --> 00:53:34,002
Old lady. Do you know
what the meaning of lettuce is?

722
00:53:35,086 --> 00:53:38,381
-Well, does it even have one?
-Yes.

723
00:53:38,882 --> 00:53:40,175
"When you're down,

724
00:53:41,176 --> 00:53:42,552
wrap it up and eat it away."

725
00:53:53,313 --> 00:53:54,689
You can do it!

726
00:53:59,236 --> 00:54:01,488
I wonder what Yu-hyeon is thinking.

727
00:54:01,571 --> 00:54:04,491
Beats me. No one knows what he's scheming.

728
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,826
How's the new employee?

729
00:54:07,827 --> 00:54:11,206
-What?
-You know, the woman the chairman hired.

730
00:54:11,706 --> 00:54:12,958
Oh, her.

731
00:54:14,542 --> 00:54:16,211
She's still getting the hang of things.

732
00:54:17,420 --> 00:54:19,297
How should I put it?

733
00:54:19,381 --> 00:54:22,968
She makes so many mistakes and is sloppy.

734
00:54:23,051 --> 00:54:25,804
Judging by how she left early
on her first day at work,

735
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:28,390
she seems brazen and irresponsible.

736
00:54:28,473 --> 00:54:30,684
She's also so self-centered.

737
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:33,103
She thinks the world revolves around her.

738
00:54:33,186 --> 00:54:34,688
Her heyday has long passed.

739
00:54:35,897 --> 00:54:37,274
Do you know each other?

740
00:54:37,857 --> 00:54:39,985
No, not at all.

741
00:54:40,735 --> 00:54:43,863
I just have that feeling.

742
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,699
I've never seen you badmouth anyone.

743
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,618
-Really?
-Yes.

744
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,661
Hold still.

745
00:54:52,455 --> 00:54:53,957
Wait!

746
00:54:54,916 --> 00:54:58,211
Why does she get to be a starfish,
when I'm seaweed?

747
00:54:58,795 --> 00:55:01,298
This was the last remaining costume.

748
00:55:01,381 --> 00:55:03,967
And it's not seaweed. It's kelp.

749
00:55:05,093 --> 00:55:06,845
They're the same thing.

750
00:55:06,928 --> 00:55:09,431
If you color my entire face black,

751
00:55:09,514 --> 00:55:11,891
no one will be able to see me.

752
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:13,184
Your face?

753
00:55:13,268 --> 00:55:16,479
You'll just be dancing in the back.
Sit down. Come on.

754
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:18,773
Then who'll take center stage?

755
00:55:21,192 --> 00:55:22,819
Are you kidding me?

756
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,865
Wasn't lying to me enough?
Now, I need to wear this?

757
00:55:26,948 --> 00:55:29,951
Don't you know I went to the salon
this morning to get my hair done?

758
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:32,287
Are you serious?

759
00:55:32,370 --> 00:55:34,748
Oh, I apologize.

760
00:55:35,415 --> 00:55:37,917
Let's take a short break. I'm sorry.

761
00:55:38,001 --> 00:55:40,086
ANTHONY
WAITING ROOM

762
00:55:41,254 --> 00:55:45,717
Anthony, let me explain.
It's supposed to be comical.

763
00:55:45,800 --> 00:55:48,887
Comical, my foot.
You've gone nuts, haven't you?

764
00:55:49,471 --> 00:55:50,722
Go get the car.

765
00:55:52,474 --> 00:55:54,142
What? Is that a no?

766
00:55:55,602 --> 00:55:57,228
Please, Anthony. Just this once.

767
00:55:57,312 --> 00:55:59,397
I never said I'd kill you two.

768
00:56:00,231 --> 00:56:01,733
I'm just opting out.

769
00:56:02,442 --> 00:56:04,903
I'm Anthony. That's who I am.

770
00:56:05,445 --> 00:56:09,199
I'd rather retire than dance
in a squid costume. Got that?

771
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,537
What are you doing?

772
00:56:15,121 --> 00:56:16,247
You can't do that.

773
00:56:17,749 --> 00:56:19,334
Mr. Park's life is at stake.

774
00:56:19,959 --> 00:56:23,671
He stood surety for the wrong person
and is at the risk of losing everything!

775
00:56:32,555 --> 00:56:34,307
CRUNCHY SQUID-FLAVORED SNACK
SQUID-GOOD

776
00:56:38,978 --> 00:56:41,272
-Thank you for doing this.
-My pleasure.

777
00:56:46,569 --> 00:56:49,739
-Here.
-Cheers.

778
00:56:52,826 --> 00:56:54,369
Let's begin.

779
00:56:55,995 --> 00:56:57,539
Get the music ready.

780
00:56:57,622 --> 00:56:58,832
Wrap it up.

781
00:56:59,541 --> 00:57:00,708
Here we go.

782
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:12,887
Squid is good
Deliciously good

783
00:57:12,971 --> 00:57:15,265
Nutritious as well

784
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:18,643
It has ten legs, a perfect squid

785
00:57:19,227 --> 00:57:23,565
Oh, everybody loves it

786
00:57:25,567 --> 00:57:27,152
Let's do that again. Anthony.

787
00:57:27,652 --> 00:57:30,447
-Be more cheerful.
-I can't hear you.

788
00:57:30,530 --> 00:57:32,240
Be more cheerful and energetic!

789
00:57:32,907 --> 00:57:33,741
Got it.

790
00:57:35,076 --> 00:57:36,035
Let's do it again.

791
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:39,289
This is our final draft,
so make sure there aren't any typos.

792
00:57:39,372 --> 00:57:41,124
-Yes, ma'am.
-Yes, ma'am.

793
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:49,382
Kim Yong-hwa
of Product Development speaking.

794
00:57:51,843 --> 00:57:52,844
What did you say?

795
00:57:55,472 --> 00:57:56,556
How could you…

796
00:57:57,891 --> 00:57:59,726
All right.

797
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:04,647
That was the factory in Anseong.
They have some issues,

798
00:58:04,731 --> 00:58:06,441
so our goods won't be here on time.

799
00:58:06,524 --> 00:58:08,860
The earliest they can do
is tomorrow morning.

800
00:58:08,943 --> 00:58:10,945
That won't work.
We have to pitch tomorrow.

801
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,780
It'll be too late by that time.

802
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,949
How about we postpone it to the afternoon?

803
00:58:15,033 --> 00:58:18,703
The chairman and the executive
 will be there, so it won't be easy.

804
00:58:24,167 --> 00:58:27,253
Call the factory
in Pocheon right now and tell them

805
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:29,214
to prepare a production line.

806
00:58:29,297 --> 00:58:32,759
We'll bring the ingredients and the recipe

807
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:36,137
to manufacture the sample there.

808
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:38,765
That could work.

809
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,433
You're incredible, Ms. Oh.

810
00:58:42,477 --> 00:58:45,188
It'll take half a day to go there
and come back.

811
00:58:45,271 --> 00:58:47,732
-How will we prepare for the pitch?
-You're right.

812
00:58:48,566 --> 00:58:51,027
None of us have the time
to go there this instant.

813
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,739
Me. Trust me and let me do this.

814
00:59:00,912 --> 00:59:02,872
Would that be okay?

815
00:59:03,998 --> 00:59:07,627
She's only picking up the sample.
What could possibly go wrong?

816
00:59:14,926 --> 00:59:17,136
When you get there,

817
00:59:17,220 --> 00:59:21,391
the person in charge will have
everything set up and be waiting.

818
00:59:21,474 --> 00:59:24,143
This is important,
so you can't mess it up.

819
00:59:25,061 --> 00:59:28,189
I won't.
I'll bring the goods back safe and sound.

820
00:59:28,898 --> 00:59:30,024
I'll take it now.

821
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,235
Goodbye.

822
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,870
JOA CONFECTIONERY

823
00:59:42,954 --> 00:59:44,581
Goodness. Oh, gosh.

824
00:59:45,123 --> 00:59:46,207
Excuse me.

825
00:59:48,334 --> 00:59:49,919
Gosh, I almost got caught.

826
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:53,881
Bahn Ha-ni?

827
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,556
That's not me.

828
01:00:01,639 --> 01:00:03,558
-Ha-ni, stop right there.
-Darn it.

829
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:04,684
She caught me.

830
01:00:05,184 --> 01:00:07,895
Bahn Ha-ni! Stop right there!

831
01:00:08,730 --> 01:00:09,564
Hey!

832
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:15,153
"Bahn Ha-ni"?

833
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:19,115
Anthony!

834
01:00:30,209 --> 01:00:31,919
Why you…

835
01:00:32,003 --> 01:00:34,130
Bahn Ha-ni! Stop right there!

836
01:01:15,546 --> 01:01:16,673
You're in!

837
01:01:17,507 --> 01:01:19,133
Excuse me, I…

838
01:01:19,217 --> 01:01:20,385
Testicles?

839
01:01:21,094 --> 01:01:22,512
Get in!

840
01:01:22,595 --> 01:01:25,264
-I don't have any money.
-I know.

841
01:01:25,348 --> 01:01:26,474
I also have a kid.

842
01:01:26,557 --> 01:01:29,060
-You should wear warmer clothes.
-What was that?

843
01:01:30,228 --> 01:01:31,312
No way!

844
01:01:32,355 --> 01:01:33,481
Gyeong-sik!

845
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,941
What is that?

846
01:01:35,024 --> 01:01:36,317
There!

847
01:01:37,068 --> 01:01:39,195
Who in the world is she?

848
01:01:39,821 --> 01:01:41,364
I want you out of my team.

849
01:01:41,447 --> 01:01:45,034
