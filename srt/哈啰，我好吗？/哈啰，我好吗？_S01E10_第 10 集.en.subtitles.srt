EPISODE 10

2
00:00:57,891 --> 00:01:00,977
They said they'd soon be back with Ha-ni.
What's taking them so long?

3
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:04,522
My goodness.

4
00:01:05,398 --> 00:01:07,067
Why on earth would this fall?

5
00:01:14,449 --> 00:01:15,533
Hello?

6
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,080
What?

7
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:21,623
No way…

8
00:01:22,874 --> 00:01:27,378
Ok-jeong, what did you just say?

9
00:01:27,462 --> 00:01:30,423
Stop crying and say that again.

10
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:33,551
What did you just say?

11
00:01:34,385 --> 00:01:36,846
What happened to Gi-tae?

12
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:41,935
Stop crying and tell me!

13
00:02:03,748 --> 00:02:04,791
Grandma.

14
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,053
Is it you, my puppy?

15
00:02:31,025 --> 00:02:32,068
Ha-ni.

16
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:34,529
My sweet little puppy.

17
00:02:37,407 --> 00:02:38,449
Grandma.

18
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:40,869
Do you recognize me?

19
00:02:44,330 --> 00:02:47,625
How did you make it
all the way here alone?

20
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,838
You have no idea how worried I was

21
00:02:52,964 --> 00:02:54,716
when I heard you were sick.

22
00:02:54,799 --> 00:02:56,551
Goodness.

23
00:02:56,634 --> 00:03:00,388
What a long trip you've made.

24
00:03:00,972 --> 00:03:02,932
Hardly. I took the bus.

25
00:03:04,392 --> 00:03:08,021
You know, I had something to give you.

26
00:03:08,104 --> 00:03:09,480
I'm glad you're here.

27
00:03:18,114 --> 00:03:21,284
Keep this with you always.

28
00:03:21,910 --> 00:03:23,703
It's the only way you'll live.

29
00:03:23,786 --> 00:03:24,954
What is this?

30
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:28,499
And what do you mean I'll live?

31
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:33,004
You must answer the phone.

32
00:03:33,838 --> 00:03:36,841
No matter what, you must answer that call.

33
00:03:41,846 --> 00:03:43,056
Grandma…

34
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:45,934
I guess you're really unwell.

35
00:03:48,228 --> 00:03:52,732
What on earth happened
to the great Lee Hong-nyeon?

36
00:03:53,608 --> 00:03:55,485
My puppy.

37
00:03:55,568 --> 00:03:59,822
I'll make sure you survive.

38
00:03:59,906 --> 00:04:02,116
I'll make sure you do.

39
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,805
-How did you get in here?
-Gosh!

40
00:04:24,973 --> 00:04:27,767
Wait. Were you home all this time?

41
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:30,353
What's that in your hand?

42
00:04:31,688 --> 00:04:33,439
Are you here to steal from us again?

43
00:04:33,523 --> 00:04:35,984
Of course not. Grandma gave this to me.

44
00:04:36,067 --> 00:04:38,945
-You know my great grandmother?
-That's none of your business.

45
00:04:39,696 --> 00:04:42,031
Anyway, I'm busy, so maybe next time.

46
00:04:42,949 --> 00:04:45,743
Can I have your phone number?

47
00:04:45,827 --> 00:04:47,036
Why do you want it?

48
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:51,124
I haven't been able
to focus on my studies.

49
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,670
All I can think about is you.
It's driving me crazy.

50
00:04:56,546 --> 00:04:57,380
What?

51
00:04:58,506 --> 00:05:01,050
Seriously? Pull yourself together!

52
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,511
-Do you even know who I am?
-Who are you?

53
00:05:03,594 --> 00:05:04,637
Ha-ni?

54
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:14,439
My goodness.

55
00:05:14,522 --> 00:05:16,607
My gosh. No way.

56
00:05:17,275 --> 00:05:21,112
How can you look exactly the same
as Ha-ni back in high school?

57
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,656
-Goodness.
-No, you're mistaken.

58
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:26,034
Wait. Hold on a second.

59
00:05:26,117 --> 00:05:27,618
I'm sorry!

60
00:05:29,078 --> 00:05:31,831
My gosh. Who is that girl?

61
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:33,916
Seong-u, do you know her?

62
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:37,295
She's the daughter of
Aunt Ha-ni's friend of a friend.

63
00:05:38,129 --> 00:05:39,213
That's what I heard.

64
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:41,132
The daughter of

65
00:05:42,258 --> 00:05:43,593
Ha-ni's friend of a friend?

66
00:05:51,059 --> 00:05:52,518
Wait, this belongs to Mother.

67
00:06:11,704 --> 00:06:13,664
Mom, I'm sorry.

68
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:18,544
I wanted to stay and be with you more.

69
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:22,965
But I'm sorry.

70
00:06:30,640 --> 00:06:32,725
Thanks to the changed ingredients,

71
00:06:32,809 --> 00:06:36,104
Joa Strawberry has been
receiving good reviews.

72
00:06:36,187 --> 00:06:40,108
And people are enjoying it
regardless of gender and age.

73
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:43,736
The power of one's palate
never ceases to amaze me.

74
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:47,198
Consumers are quick to catch
the slightest change to the taste.

75
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,616
That's why…

76
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,202
I'm making sure that

77
00:06:51,285 --> 00:06:53,830
my world-class palate
stays at the top of its game.

78
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,081
This isn't for free.

79
00:06:57,333 --> 00:06:59,502
Unbelievable.
Draw that tongue of yours back in.

80
00:07:00,086 --> 00:07:02,421
-I see the white coating on it.
-White coating?

81
00:07:02,505 --> 00:07:05,049
I make myself nearly vomit to clean it,
you know.

82
00:07:05,133 --> 00:07:07,051
-No, I don't know.
-Why not?

83
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:10,972
Them arguing tells us
it's time to end the meeting.

84
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,224
You're right. That'll be all for today.

85
00:07:13,307 --> 00:07:14,934
-Good job, everyone.
-Good job.

86
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,769
-What?
-Did you hit me?

87
00:07:16,853 --> 00:07:18,146
-So what?
-Unbelievable.

88
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:19,522
"So what?"

89
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:21,065
You're unbelievable.

90
00:07:22,233 --> 00:07:24,944
Hold on a second. Gosh.

91
00:07:27,738 --> 00:07:30,658
There's no need to worry.
They're just putting on a show.

92
00:07:31,325 --> 00:07:34,287
-Sorry?
-It's obvious that they're dating.

93
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,913
Maybe they want us to know now.

94
00:07:35,997 --> 00:07:37,457
Did you know?

95
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:41,043
Only they don't know that
they're the company's official couple.

96
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:42,712
Unbelievable.

97
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,088
Fools, right?

98
00:07:49,385 --> 00:07:52,221
How do you do this kind of research?

99
00:07:52,847 --> 00:07:56,309
You gather a group of consumers
online or through social media

100
00:07:56,392 --> 00:07:59,103
and collect the data
from the survey they fill out.

101
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:03,316
For renewed products like Joa Strawberry
or newly-launched products,

102
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:05,860
the opinions of various consumers

103
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,863
are the most objective data
we can depend on.

104
00:08:09,697 --> 00:08:11,157
The opinions of consumers.

105
00:08:12,366 --> 00:08:13,701
That's right.

106
00:08:13,784 --> 00:08:15,953
It's lunchtime, so let's get going.

107
00:08:18,748 --> 00:08:20,541
Ha-ni and I will head out first,

108
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,710
so join us after five minutes.

109
00:08:22,793 --> 00:08:24,170
-Got it, honey?
-Got it.

110
00:08:25,129 --> 00:08:27,465
I don't think there's any need for this.

111
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:30,718
Still, it's better to be cautious
at the office.

112
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,721
It's how we've kept our secret.

113
00:08:36,474 --> 00:08:37,558
Right.

114
00:08:38,976 --> 00:08:40,061
That reminds me.

115
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,647
Are you dating someone at work too?

116
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:45,691
It'll be fun to go on
a double date sometime.

117
00:08:46,275 --> 00:08:47,485
A double date?

118
00:08:48,736 --> 00:08:51,072
That handsome cook at the cafeteria.

119
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:52,490
Isn't he your boyfriend?

120
00:08:52,573 --> 00:08:55,785
No way. It's not what you think.

121
00:08:55,868 --> 00:08:59,413
Don't lie to me.
He even made tteokbokki for you back then.

122
00:08:59,497 --> 00:09:00,623
It's not like that.

123
00:09:01,874 --> 00:09:03,251
I have to take this.

124
00:09:04,168 --> 00:09:06,045
You're just trying to change the subject.

125
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:09,340
Mom?

126
00:09:09,423 --> 00:09:12,885
I'll be stopping
by your house this evening.

127
00:09:12,969 --> 00:09:15,680
My house? Why?

128
00:09:16,430 --> 00:09:17,723
Is something up?

129
00:09:17,807 --> 00:09:20,643
I should say it in person,
so I'll see you then. Bye.

130
00:09:28,943 --> 00:09:31,404
-Why on earth do you have this?
-Mother?

131
00:09:31,487 --> 00:09:35,157
I gave it to Ha-ni, so why do you have it?

132
00:09:35,783 --> 00:09:38,369
-Ha-ni?
-Give it back to her right away.

133
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:40,162
She'll die if you don't.

134
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:43,207
-Mother, please.
-Right now!

135
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,210
Anthony, will you go home now?

136
00:09:46,752 --> 00:09:49,213
Since we're here, let's get a bite to eat.

137
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:51,215
You used to live around here.

138
00:09:51,299 --> 00:09:53,259
Isn't there some place nice?

139
00:09:54,302 --> 00:09:56,804
Yes, Mom's Snacks. It's great.

140
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,222
My mouth is already watering.

141
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,475
I don't see Mom's Snacks.

142
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:04,437
It must have gone out of business.

143
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:06,522
It must have meant a lot to you.

144
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:11,110
I always went there after skipping class.

145
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,905
I had my first kiss nearby too.

146
00:10:14,989 --> 00:10:18,200
Your first kiss?
With that first love of yours?

147
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:35,301
Even the school has changed a lot.

148
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:47,063
Ha-ni.

149
00:10:47,980 --> 00:10:49,106
Ha-ni…

150
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,504
Ha-ni…

151
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,806
Dad.

152
00:11:30,648 --> 00:11:31,816
Dad…

153
00:11:34,276 --> 00:11:35,528
No!

154
00:11:44,328 --> 00:11:47,164
Dad…

155
00:11:47,998 --> 00:11:49,333
-My gosh.
-Dad…

156
00:11:50,292 --> 00:11:52,420
Dad!

157
00:11:53,212 --> 00:11:54,880
I'm sorry, Ha-ni.

158
00:11:54,964 --> 00:11:57,216
It's all my fault.

159
00:11:58,008 --> 00:11:59,927
Dad… No! Please…

160
00:12:00,636 --> 00:12:01,762
Please…

161
00:12:11,188 --> 00:12:12,148
What's on your mind?

162
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:14,358
Past memories.

163
00:12:16,068 --> 00:12:19,864
Has reuniting with your first love
stirred up emotions inside?

164
00:12:22,116 --> 00:12:23,742
Is that what it is?

165
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,787
It could also be guilt.

166
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:28,789
Guilt? For what?

167
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,710
The reason she changed…

168
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,505
Well, it could be my fault.

169
00:12:36,589 --> 00:12:37,756
What do you mean by that?

170
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:41,427
The death of Ha-ni's father.

171
00:12:44,221 --> 00:12:46,056
I'm partially at fault.

172
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,350
What?

173
00:12:49,727 --> 00:12:50,936
We should go, Jeong-man.

174
00:13:10,873 --> 00:13:13,250
Did you throw
all the salt we have in here?

175
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,503
This could elevate
someone's blood pressure.

176
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:16,837
I won't

177
00:13:18,088 --> 00:13:19,340
let it happen again.

178
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,676
Newbie, you'd better watch it.

179
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,804
We have our eyes on you at all times.

180
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:41,237
-Please enjoy.
-Thank you.

181
00:13:44,698 --> 00:13:46,534
Here you go.

182
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:50,788
Hey, Mr. Competent.

183
00:13:50,871 --> 00:13:54,667
Do you know how I can
appease the ladies' anger?

184
00:13:55,459 --> 00:13:57,878
I'm too scared to even talk to them.

185
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,257
This is because
I disbanded Hanwoo Galbi, right?

186
00:14:10,683 --> 00:14:14,103
-Wait. This isn't what I usually drink.
-How is it?

187
00:14:14,186 --> 00:14:17,856
I tried selecting
the best coffee for you today.

188
00:14:21,735 --> 00:14:23,612
Dark roast coffee. How smooth.

189
00:14:23,696 --> 00:14:25,614
I taste the heaviness on my tongue.

190
00:14:25,698 --> 00:14:27,032
The aftertaste is rich too.

191
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,577
Nice choice!

192
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:34,999
Unbelievable. The way you describe
the taste of your coffee

193
00:14:35,082 --> 00:14:36,166
is so artistic.

194
00:14:36,250 --> 00:14:37,084
Right.

195
00:14:38,002 --> 00:14:41,213
Wait. I shouldn't enjoy this on my own.

196
00:14:41,297 --> 00:14:44,425
Order two more to-go
for the ladies at the kitchen.

197
00:14:44,508 --> 00:14:45,676
Sure thing.

198
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:55,811
-Hello?
-Newbie.

199
00:14:56,729 --> 00:14:59,315
Where have you gone
to slack off this time?

200
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:01,317
Slack off?

201
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:04,486
I'm here fetching
the most delicious coffee for you.

202
00:15:04,570 --> 00:15:06,739
Cut the excuses and get back to work!

203
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:08,991
Yes, ma'am.

204
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:17,166
How bitter.

205
00:15:26,592 --> 00:15:28,010
You don't like it here too?

206
00:15:30,638 --> 00:15:32,848
I'm sorry for being so picky.

207
00:15:33,766 --> 00:15:36,477
It's not you, but the little one inside.

208
00:15:38,604 --> 00:15:39,980
Aren't you craving anything?

209
00:15:45,069 --> 00:15:47,071
-There is this one thing.
-What is it?

210
00:15:48,155 --> 00:15:52,242
I'd like some twisted breadsticks
from Granny's.

211
00:15:54,119 --> 00:15:55,829
Let's go then. I'll buy loads of it.

212
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:59,583
We can leave right after
I'm back from the restroom.

213
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:04,713
Sure.

214
00:16:11,470 --> 00:16:13,514
-Mom?
-Oh, hey.

215
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:16,934
-What brings you here?
-For lunch.

216
00:16:17,434 --> 00:16:19,979
-Who did you come with?
-I'm here for lunch too.

217
00:16:20,062 --> 00:16:20,980
Get going then.

218
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:45,587
Okay. Let's get going.

219
00:16:46,088 --> 00:16:47,214
Thanks, honey.

220
00:16:56,640 --> 00:17:00,102
You know, I saw that guy just now.

221
00:17:00,185 --> 00:17:01,603
-Who?
-Well…

222
00:17:02,521 --> 00:17:03,981
Pocheon Factory's head manager.

223
00:17:04,064 --> 00:17:05,774
-The head manager?
-Yes.

224
00:17:07,276 --> 00:17:08,360
I wonder why he's here.

225
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,663
What do you think? Can you do it?

226
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,292
But wouldn't that

227
00:17:24,376 --> 00:17:26,462
do considerable damage to the company?

228
00:17:29,131 --> 00:17:30,549
That's what I want.

229
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:35,804
It's time you work at the headquarters.

230
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,182
By the way,

231
00:17:38,265 --> 00:17:40,893
I heard your daughter is
about to graduate college.

232
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,104
It's hard to get a job these days.

233
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:47,024
You must be extremely worried about her.

234
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:49,735
Well, yes.

235
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:56,283
Take your time
and think about it over lunch.

236
00:17:57,117 --> 00:17:58,202
I'll call you again.

237
00:18:12,508 --> 00:18:14,218
I had a strange feeling about this.

238
00:18:16,678 --> 00:18:18,639
I'm glad I recorded the conversation.

239
00:18:21,016 --> 00:18:22,142
But seriously,

240
00:18:22,893 --> 00:18:26,396
what is Ms. Han trying to do?

241
00:18:32,319 --> 00:18:35,364
Hey, what are you doing? Pack your stuff.

242
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:36,448
Why?

243
00:18:37,199 --> 00:18:40,077
Didn't you get my text?
Mom's on her way here.

244
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,247
What? Why all of a sudden?

245
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:45,791
I don't know.
I'll call you once she leaves.

246
00:18:45,874 --> 00:18:47,960
-Wait outside.
-Okay.

247
00:18:49,128 --> 00:18:50,254
My gosh, seriously.

248
00:18:50,337 --> 00:18:52,381
Just put them in here.

249
00:19:00,681 --> 00:19:02,307
Mom, I live up there.

250
00:19:05,853 --> 00:19:08,981
Your place is nice and tidy.

251
00:19:09,731 --> 00:19:10,774
Here.

252
00:19:11,525 --> 00:19:13,777
Let me give you something to drink.

253
00:19:13,861 --> 00:19:15,904
No, it's okay. Come sit down.

254
00:19:16,947 --> 00:19:19,116
Goodness, this sitting mat…

255
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:22,953
What's the matter?

256
00:19:23,787 --> 00:19:27,374
Earlier at Ha-yeong's place,
I saw a girl who looked just like you.

257
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,419
What?

258
00:19:30,502 --> 00:19:33,630
She ran away,
so I didn't get a closer look,

259
00:19:34,214 --> 00:19:37,009
but she looked so much like you.

260
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:39,511
Seong-u told me
she's your friend's daughter.

261
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:40,637
Who is that girl?

262
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,890
Well, she's…

263
00:19:43,473 --> 00:19:44,474
my friend's daughter.

264
00:19:45,642 --> 00:19:47,728
Everyone says we look alike,

265
00:19:47,811 --> 00:19:49,563
but it's because
you didn't get a good look.

266
00:19:49,646 --> 00:19:52,649
She doesn't look like me at all.

267
00:19:53,275 --> 00:19:54,276
Really?

268
00:19:55,777 --> 00:19:57,279
But why was she at Ha-yeong's?

269
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,782
She met Seong-u once.

270
00:20:01,408 --> 00:20:02,534
Where is she now?

271
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,662
She went to the States
with my friend today.

272
00:20:07,831 --> 00:20:10,167
Maybe she went there
to say goodbye to Seong-u.

273
00:20:11,335 --> 00:20:12,336
Is that true?

274
00:20:12,419 --> 00:20:14,880
Of course. Why would I lie about that?

275
00:20:15,923 --> 00:20:19,051
Did you come here to ask me that?

276
00:20:20,469 --> 00:20:22,971
No, I wanted to see how you were doing.

277
00:20:23,805 --> 00:20:28,435
And your grandma wanted me
to give you this.

278
00:20:29,019 --> 00:20:30,062
This?

279
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:34,733
It's my old cell phone charger.

280
00:20:34,816 --> 00:20:36,526
Why did she want me to have this?

281
00:20:36,610 --> 00:20:39,905
I brought it because she made a fuss
saying you needed to have it.

282
00:20:39,988 --> 00:20:42,658
You can keep it or throw it away.

283
00:20:46,370 --> 00:20:47,496
I should go now.

284
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,624
You're leaving already?

285
00:20:50,707 --> 00:20:53,794
Ha-yeong can't take care of your grandma
all by herself. I should go.

286
00:20:55,420 --> 00:20:56,964
-Mom.
-Go on inside.

287
00:20:57,047 --> 00:20:57,965
Let me…

288
00:20:58,966 --> 00:20:59,841
Yu-hyeon.

289
00:21:00,801 --> 00:21:03,387
-What brings you here?
-Who is he?

290
00:21:03,971 --> 00:21:06,139
Oh, she's my mom.

291
00:21:06,223 --> 00:21:07,182
Oh, I see.

292
00:21:07,266 --> 00:21:09,601
Hello, I'm Han Yu-hyeon.

293
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:10,769
I'm her work colleague.

294
00:21:11,561 --> 00:21:14,189
A work colleague? Is that all?

295
00:21:14,982 --> 00:21:16,066
What?

296
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:21,530
I mean, it's weird that you're here
at such a late hour.

297
00:21:21,613 --> 00:21:25,492
Oh, I'm sorry.
I needed to discuss something about work.

298
00:21:25,575 --> 00:21:27,452
-I'll come back next time.
-Okay.

299
00:21:28,328 --> 00:21:30,247
No, I was just about to leave.

300
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:32,582
You can stay and discuss whatever.

301
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,167
-Mom.
-Just stay.

302
00:21:34,251 --> 00:21:36,169
Yu-hyeon, I'll be right back.

303
00:21:36,253 --> 00:21:37,629
-Bye, ma'am.
-Just stay.

304
00:21:37,713 --> 00:21:39,006
Gosh, Mom.

305
00:21:40,173 --> 00:21:42,384
Hey, did you…

306
00:21:43,593 --> 00:21:45,595
wanted to move out because of him?

307
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:47,973
Gosh, no.

308
00:21:48,849 --> 00:21:50,559
I like him.

309
00:21:50,642 --> 00:21:54,271
He's handsome, tall, and polite.

310
00:21:55,772 --> 00:21:57,357
It's not what you think.

311
00:21:58,608 --> 00:22:00,861
I'm saying he seems like a catch.

312
00:22:00,944 --> 00:22:02,487
You should go back inside.

313
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:09,077
-Ha-ni.
-Yes?

314
00:22:11,371 --> 00:22:13,999
I'm grateful that you're doing well.

315
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:22,049
It's cold. You should go. Go on.

316
00:22:58,877 --> 00:23:01,713
After you suggested using tofu,

317
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:05,217
I brought some toppings we could use.
What do you think?

318
00:23:05,842 --> 00:23:07,636
I think they're nice.

319
00:23:07,719 --> 00:23:10,931
But I don't think
fruit goes well with tofu.

320
00:23:12,140 --> 00:23:14,559
The nuts are actually a good idea.

321
00:23:15,519 --> 00:23:17,229
But can you think of anything else?

322
00:23:18,021 --> 00:23:19,022
Anything else?

323
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:23,944
How about sesame seeds?

324
00:23:24,027 --> 00:23:25,445
My mom used to dip tofu

325
00:23:25,529 --> 00:23:29,324
into beaten eggs with sesame seeds
before she fried them.

326
00:23:29,407 --> 00:23:30,784
And they were really good.

327
00:23:30,867 --> 00:23:34,412
I think that'd work.
They would go well together.

328
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,207
Let's try making it
in the kitchen tomorrow.

329
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:39,209
I should go now.

330
00:23:41,419 --> 00:23:46,049
By the way, is your mother a cab driver?

331
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:48,468
I saw her cab from up here.

332
00:23:49,052 --> 00:23:50,804
Yes, she's been doing it for a while.

333
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:53,098
That's amazing.

334
00:23:53,181 --> 00:23:55,892
I really like cab drivers.

335
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:56,810
Why?

336
00:23:56,893 --> 00:24:00,814
Back when I was young,
a cab driver saved my life.

337
00:24:03,733 --> 00:24:05,777
But where's your daughter?

338
00:24:09,573 --> 00:24:10,907
Oh, right.

339
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,785
It's so cold.

340
00:24:24,671 --> 00:24:26,006
Is Mom gone?

341
00:24:27,883 --> 00:24:30,886
Gosh, it's so cold.
I almost froze to death.

342
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:34,514
My goodness.

343
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:36,516
I told you not to go to Ha-yeong's.

344
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:38,685
I missed grandma so much.

345
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:42,939
Mom almost found out this time.

346
00:24:43,023 --> 00:24:46,902
You know what? Mom said my name
as soon as she saw me.

347
00:24:47,402 --> 00:24:49,613
It's really hard to fool mom.

348
00:24:49,696 --> 00:24:52,782
She may have aged,
but she's still so quick-witted.

349
00:24:53,783 --> 00:24:54,784
Did you have fun?

350
00:24:54,868 --> 00:24:57,954
Anyway, I told her you went to the States.

351
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:01,208
So from now on,
don't even go near Ha-yeong's place.

352
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:02,959
Okay, I won't.

353
00:25:03,543 --> 00:25:05,170
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

354
00:25:07,547 --> 00:25:09,674
Mom came and gave me this.

355
00:25:10,508 --> 00:25:13,595
Apparently, grandma told her
to give me this.

356
00:25:13,678 --> 00:25:15,055
She said the same thing to me.

357
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:17,766
I wonder why.

358
00:25:19,226 --> 00:25:20,352
Let me see.

359
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:23,897
Okay.

360
00:25:33,114 --> 00:25:34,199
There we go.

361
00:25:36,701 --> 00:25:37,869
Does it turn on?

362
00:25:37,953 --> 00:25:39,913
No, it's completely out.

363
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,457
But I can't use this here anyway.

364
00:25:42,540 --> 00:25:43,917
You're right.

365
00:25:45,543 --> 00:25:47,879
Anyway, I'll be really busy
starting from tomorrow.

366
00:25:47,963 --> 00:25:50,590
So please don't cause any trouble
and stay put.

367
00:25:50,674 --> 00:25:51,925
Okay.

368
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,681
By the way, where's Dad?

369
00:25:59,224 --> 00:26:00,892
-What?
-I mean,

370
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:04,521
I've seen Grandma, Mom, and Ha-yeong.

371
00:26:05,730 --> 00:26:08,316
But I've never seen Dad.

372
00:26:10,819 --> 00:26:12,237
Dad is

373
00:26:13,363 --> 00:26:16,199
busy working in Daejeon.

374
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,744
Oh, I see.

375
00:26:20,537 --> 00:26:23,248
Then why don't we take a trip to Daejeon?

376
00:26:23,331 --> 00:26:24,416
Hey!

377
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:26,668
I'm just kidding.

378
00:26:27,210 --> 00:26:29,462
Gosh, it's freezing.

379
00:26:44,811 --> 00:26:46,604
Please look to your front.

380
00:26:50,150 --> 00:26:51,776
Keep your eyes open and don't move.

381
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:54,654
The only thing we can do
is slow things down.

382
00:26:54,738 --> 00:26:57,198
It's hard to expect things to get better.

383
00:26:59,492 --> 00:27:02,871
Are you saying I'll eventually go blind?

384
00:27:05,248 --> 00:27:08,335
You should tell your family
before it's too late.

385
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,758
Not yet.

386
00:27:16,593 --> 00:27:18,970
Especially not to him.

387
00:28:12,857 --> 00:28:14,567
Goodness, I'm sorry.

388
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:18,321
You…

389
00:28:18,405 --> 00:28:21,074
Why are you wearing sunglasses
in the middle of the night?

390
00:28:21,157 --> 00:28:21,991
Why are you here?

391
00:28:22,075 --> 00:28:24,411
I'm on my way to dinner.
I got hungry while working.

392
00:28:24,494 --> 00:28:26,162
What work? The cafeteria is closed.

393
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,288
None of your business.

394
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,957
I'll see you.

395
00:28:31,376 --> 00:28:32,419
Do you want me

396
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:34,337
to buy you dinner?

397
00:28:45,598 --> 00:28:47,434
How do you know this place?

398
00:28:47,517 --> 00:28:49,185
Do-yun brought me here.

399
00:28:49,936 --> 00:28:52,731
But why didn't you ever teach me
how to drink

400
00:28:52,814 --> 00:28:54,107
like you did with Do-yun?

401
00:28:54,816 --> 00:28:57,152
You were always too busy to drink with me.

402
00:28:58,403 --> 00:28:59,404
Was I?

403
00:29:01,030 --> 00:29:03,074
How's the preparation
for the contest going?

404
00:29:03,158 --> 00:29:05,493
It's going okay.

405
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,453
It's fun.

406
00:29:08,288 --> 00:29:12,417
You used to make such a fuss
because you hated snacks.

407
00:29:12,500 --> 00:29:13,793
What's gotten into you?

408
00:29:13,877 --> 00:29:15,795
It's not the snacks I hated.

409
00:29:16,421 --> 00:29:17,630
I was just angry at you.

410
00:29:18,631 --> 00:29:19,716
What?

411
00:29:20,300 --> 00:29:24,012
People always say
snacks remind them of the good days.

412
00:29:25,430 --> 00:29:26,765
But snacks only remind me of

413
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,268
how lonely I used to be.

414
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,858
Back then, I admit I didn't spend
a lot of time with you

415
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:38,526
because I was too busy with work.

416
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:41,237
It's fine. It's all in the past.

417
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:44,908
So how do you feel about snacks now?

418
00:29:47,869 --> 00:29:50,371
I'm still not that fond of them.

419
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:52,832
But how should I put it?

420
00:29:52,916 --> 00:29:55,752
I think I kind of get
why people become so happy

421
00:29:56,628 --> 00:29:58,713
over a bag of snacks.

422
00:30:05,094 --> 00:30:06,888
Here. Pour me a glass.

423
00:30:08,014 --> 00:30:09,015
Sure.

424
00:30:11,017 --> 00:30:13,853
Hey, one hand should hold the bottle,

425
00:30:13,937 --> 00:30:17,315
and the other hand should support
your wrist or arm.

426
00:30:17,398 --> 00:30:18,858
Why does that even matter?

427
00:30:19,442 --> 00:30:22,779
This is why you need to learn
how to drink from adults. Try it.

428
00:30:24,781 --> 00:30:25,865
Here.

429
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:30,161
Hey, hey!

430
00:30:31,746 --> 00:30:33,414
You shouldn't pour too much.

431
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,334
Gosh, just drink it.
It's all going to go in your belly anyway.

432
00:30:46,928 --> 00:30:50,390
I can't believe
we're drinking together like this.

433
00:30:53,726 --> 00:30:55,228
-Cheers.
-Okay.

434
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:06,447
Shall we give it a try?

435
00:31:28,428 --> 00:31:29,512
Press it again.

436
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,365
Let's try one more time.

437
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:53,411
Here we go.

438
00:32:19,062 --> 00:32:20,355
What do you think?

439
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:22,607
It's not bad.

440
00:32:23,316 --> 00:32:25,360
But it tastes a bit bland.

441
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:26,361
Gosh.

442
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:28,196
Maybe it's just you.

443
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:31,240
I'm an expert when it comes to snacks.

444
00:32:31,324 --> 00:32:35,161
I can tell if it's going to be a hit
just by tasting it.

445
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:39,624
Then why don't we test our new product?

446
00:32:39,707 --> 00:32:41,709
-Test it?
-Yes.

447
00:32:41,793 --> 00:32:43,503
Tomorrow's the weekend.

448
00:32:43,586 --> 00:32:45,838
So we should go outside

449
00:32:45,922 --> 00:32:48,591
and let people taste it
for the next two days.

450
00:32:50,051 --> 00:32:51,094
Tomorrow?

451
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,763
I have plans tomorrow.

452
00:32:53,846 --> 00:32:56,849
Gosh, then that won't work. What a pity.

453
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:58,267
Let's do it on Sunday.

454
00:32:58,351 --> 00:33:00,561
We can't gather enough information
in one day.

455
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:03,856
And it's hard to get feedback
from a variety of age groups.

456
00:33:04,524 --> 00:33:06,109
Then…

457
00:33:06,192 --> 00:33:08,403
Why don't we ask our acquaintances?

458
00:33:08,486 --> 00:33:10,071
We have no acquaintances.

459
00:33:10,154 --> 00:33:11,239
I'll take care of it.

460
00:33:11,322 --> 00:33:14,450
So that means tomorrow,
we're all free to do whatever.

461
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:17,537
Okay?

462
00:33:31,968 --> 00:33:33,219
Gosh, you startled me!

463
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:36,139
-Gosh.
-Where are you sneaking off to?

464
00:33:36,222 --> 00:33:38,558
I'm meeting someone.

465
00:33:39,267 --> 00:33:40,393
You're meeting someone?

466
00:33:41,060 --> 00:33:42,478
-Who?
-What?

467
00:33:43,187 --> 00:33:44,731
I'm meeting So-hye.

468
00:33:44,814 --> 00:33:47,275
Gosh, don't lie to me.

469
00:33:48,359 --> 00:33:50,695
Hey, I'm you.

470
00:33:50,778 --> 00:33:52,488
I can see your eyes flickering.

471
00:33:52,572 --> 00:33:55,158
-Open your bag.
-Are you my teacher or what?

472
00:33:55,241 --> 00:33:57,744
Why are you checking what's in my bag?

473
00:33:57,827 --> 00:33:58,953
Three, two, one.

474
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,997
You're just like Mom.

475
00:34:01,998 --> 00:34:06,127
I didn't want to wake you
by making a sound.

476
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:09,672
I was being considerate
so you could sleep in.

477
00:34:09,756 --> 00:34:11,716
Where are you off to with this outfit?

478
00:34:11,799 --> 00:34:14,677
I felt so stuffy inside.

479
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:18,014
So I thought I'd go for a walk.

480
00:34:22,101 --> 00:34:23,895
-What's this?
-Don't touch it.

481
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:26,230
That's mine!

482
00:34:26,314 --> 00:34:27,440
It's mine!

483
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:32,695
"The Point Entertainment"?

484
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:42,288
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

485
00:34:45,917 --> 00:34:47,293
What is this?

486
00:34:48,127 --> 00:34:49,545
Answer me!

487
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:53,758
This one.

488
00:34:53,841 --> 00:34:55,968
-The third one.
-No, not this. This won't do.

489
00:34:56,052 --> 00:34:58,471
-Doesn't this one look too cheap?
-How about…

490
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:02,100
Did you give her this?

491
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:05,728
-No.
-Hello, ma'am.

492
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,605
We were meaning to visit you.

493
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:09,941
We'd like to make your daughter
into a top star.

494
00:35:10,024 --> 00:35:13,444
Forget it. She has neither the intentions

495
00:35:13,528 --> 00:35:15,279
nor the ability to become a celebrity,

496
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,906
so don't give her false hope.

497
00:35:16,989 --> 00:35:19,784
I don't have the ability?
How could you say that?

498
00:35:20,284 --> 00:35:22,328
These days,
kids who are impudent and rude,

499
00:35:22,411 --> 00:35:24,539
and who interfere in adults' conversation

500
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:26,624
are complimented for their "swag."

501
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:28,918
The public loves them.

502
00:35:29,669 --> 00:35:31,754
-Sir.
-Chun-sik.

503
00:35:33,047 --> 00:35:34,590
No. Anthony.

504
00:35:35,508 --> 00:35:37,343
Let me ask you a favor.

505
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:40,972
If she ever comes here again
and does something foolish,

506
00:35:42,223 --> 00:35:43,349
let me know.

507
00:35:45,685 --> 00:35:46,894
Let's go.

508
00:35:47,645 --> 00:35:50,523
No. I want to watch them film
and become a celebrity too!

509
00:35:50,606 --> 00:35:52,859
-Have you gone insane?
-Goodness.

510
00:35:52,942 --> 00:35:55,486
Why are you so immature and reckless?

511
00:35:55,570 --> 00:35:57,697
How am I being reckless?

512
00:35:58,364 --> 00:36:01,576
Must I stay home waiting for you all day
and do as you say?

513
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:03,452
Am I a doll or something?

514
00:36:03,536 --> 00:36:07,748
That's no way to talk to your mom!

515
00:36:08,291 --> 00:36:10,668
What an impudent, little girl.

516
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:12,920
You were worse than me at my age.

517
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,381
A dean beat you with a mop
for being cheeky.

518
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:19,051
How did you know that?

519
00:36:19,135 --> 00:36:20,386
Did you tell her?

520
00:36:21,971 --> 00:36:24,307
Yes. Let's say that I did.

521
00:36:25,808 --> 00:36:28,603
Come on out. Stop talking nonsense,
and we'll talk at home.

522
00:36:29,604 --> 00:36:31,355
-I don't want to.
-What?

523
00:36:31,439 --> 00:36:33,900
-Hey.
-No. Don't do that.

524
00:36:33,983 --> 00:36:35,067
-Wait.
-Hey.

525
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,360
Gosh. Stop it!

526
00:36:36,444 --> 00:36:37,570
I don't want to!

527
00:36:37,653 --> 00:36:41,699
Mother, that's enough.
You know what kids are like at her age!

528
00:36:41,782 --> 00:36:43,284
"Mother"?

529
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:46,662
Stop calling me that!
I've never been married before!

530
00:36:48,497 --> 00:36:50,041
But you had her?

531
00:36:50,124 --> 00:36:52,501
Gosh. I had no idea. I'm sorry.

532
00:36:53,628 --> 00:36:57,089
I'm sorry. I really had no idea
and told her to bring her parents--

533
00:36:57,173 --> 00:37:00,176
Anthony. Mr. Park. We're in huge trouble.

534
00:37:01,385 --> 00:37:02,511
Gosh.

535
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,264
What's wrong? Where's the model?

536
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:07,475
She left in an ambulance.

537
00:37:08,309 --> 00:37:09,769
How did she get hurt?

538
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:12,396
She tripped on one of the cables..

539
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,981
This is not good.

540
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:16,359
We need to get this done
by the end of the day.

541
00:37:18,486 --> 00:37:20,363
-Is she a part of your entourage?
-Who?

542
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:22,198
Her.

543
00:37:24,784 --> 00:37:27,119
-Please help us out!
-Ha-ni.

544
00:37:28,120 --> 00:37:29,330
Are you crazy?

545
00:37:29,872 --> 00:37:32,416
Come on. How could I be a model?

546
00:37:32,500 --> 00:37:35,044
Ha-ni, it's not hard at all.

547
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:36,337
Just put on some clothes

548
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:38,381
and pose like you did before.

549
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,049
You'll be done in no time.

550
00:37:40,132 --> 00:37:42,718
We're going to make extreme changes
on Photoshop,

551
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,054
so you won't even recognize yourself.

552
00:37:45,137 --> 00:37:48,015
I don't care. I won't do it.

553
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,267
Then may I do it?

554
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,519
I know I can do it.

555
00:37:57,358 --> 00:37:59,151
Yes. That's it.

556
00:37:59,235 --> 00:38:03,447
Hey, let's include the girl
and make you guys look like a family.

557
00:38:03,531 --> 00:38:06,784
Ms. Bahn will feel more comfortable
if her daughter joins. Right?

558
00:38:07,535 --> 00:38:11,998
So you want us to pose like a family.

559
00:38:12,081 --> 00:38:13,666
That means I'll be in the picture.

560
00:38:13,749 --> 00:38:15,668
-I'm down!
-Me too!

561
00:38:15,751 --> 00:38:17,086
I'm down.

562
00:38:17,169 --> 00:38:20,214
Me and Ha-ni as a family?

563
00:38:20,298 --> 00:38:23,843
That means I'll pose as her husband.
Okay. I'll do it.

564
00:38:23,926 --> 00:38:25,594
Don't be ridiculous.

565
00:38:26,262 --> 00:38:28,973
This is absurd.

566
00:38:30,266 --> 00:38:31,392
Ha-ni.

567
00:38:34,437 --> 00:38:36,647
This isn't going to be aired on TV.

568
00:38:36,731 --> 00:38:39,483
We're just dressing up for pictures.
Is that too much?

569
00:38:40,735 --> 00:38:42,987
-Yes.
-Please. Just this once.

570
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:46,824
This is my lifelong dream.
Please, just this once.

571
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,535
And we've never taken a photo together.

572
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:50,745
What if…

573
00:38:53,873 --> 00:38:56,500
someone sees the photos?

574
00:38:57,084 --> 00:38:58,461
Who cares?

575
00:38:58,544 --> 00:39:00,046
I'll be long gone by then.

576
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:04,967
If you do this,

577
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:07,178
I won't cause any more trouble

578
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:11,349
and stay home all day
until the day I leave.

579
00:39:11,432 --> 00:39:14,643
I'm begging you. Please?

580
00:39:15,269 --> 00:39:17,480
They're all waiting for you.

581
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:24,737
Gosh.

582
00:39:37,625 --> 00:39:39,543
Goodness. This is so moist.

583
00:39:39,627 --> 00:39:41,128
It's not sticky at all.

584
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:47,134
At this rate, I'll be radiating
in front of the camera.

585
00:39:47,218 --> 00:39:51,055
Hey. I get it, so be quiet.

586
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:54,433
I'll put makeup on you,
so close your eyes.

587
00:39:55,351 --> 00:39:57,728
Today's my dream day,

588
00:39:57,812 --> 00:39:59,438
so please make me look pretty.

589
00:39:59,522 --> 00:40:00,523
Okay.

590
00:40:06,987 --> 00:40:08,531
This is going to be great.

591
00:40:08,614 --> 00:40:10,074
I agree.

592
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:17,581
What do you think?

593
00:40:18,374 --> 00:40:20,376
Hey, you look good.

594
00:40:20,459 --> 00:40:22,920
Right. Can I keep this hoodie?

595
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:26,048
It's so comfortable and nice.

596
00:40:26,132 --> 00:40:27,591
Sure, you can. I'll tell them.

597
00:40:45,734 --> 00:40:48,279
Look at you.

598
00:40:48,863 --> 00:40:51,490
You look amazing. I barely recognized you.

599
00:40:51,574 --> 00:40:52,616
Isn't she pretty?

600
00:40:52,700 --> 00:40:53,993
-Hey.
-Who's that?

601
00:40:54,076 --> 00:40:55,077
Hey.

602
00:40:55,911 --> 00:40:56,912
Who is she?

603
00:40:57,455 --> 00:40:58,414
Ms. Bahn.

604
00:40:59,039 --> 00:41:00,374
Isn't she pretty?

605
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,418
Let's begin.

606
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:13,262
Imagine that you're a family. That's it.

607
00:41:13,345 --> 00:41:15,764
-Goodness.
-Smile.

608
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,477
Do your own thing.
Let's not get all touchy.

609
00:41:19,560 --> 00:41:20,811
But we're a family.

610
00:41:21,812 --> 00:41:23,063
I'm not dreaming, am I?

611
00:41:24,940 --> 00:41:26,066
Are you that happy?

612
00:41:26,150 --> 00:41:28,319
Of course. This is my first photo shoot.

613
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:31,447
I'm taking the magazine back with me.

614
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,699
It'll be my most cherished item.

615
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:36,869
All right. Pose. Let's all pose.

616
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,427
-Hey.
-Hey.

617
00:41:55,387 --> 00:41:58,891
Look at you smiling from ear to ear.

618
00:41:58,974 --> 00:42:00,017
Be quiet.

619
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,312
You.

620
00:42:04,563 --> 00:42:06,941
-Why are you here?
-I'm not here to see you.

621
00:42:07,024 --> 00:42:08,442
He invited me over.

622
00:42:09,318 --> 00:42:11,028
This is my house.

623
00:42:11,111 --> 00:42:15,616
I see. It must be grand
to live in such a large house.

624
00:42:15,699 --> 00:42:18,077
Whereas, your one and only son lives
in a tiny box

625
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:19,620
and can barely stretch his legs.

626
00:42:19,703 --> 00:42:22,373
Uncle, I called him over
because I needed to talk with him.

627
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,333
Hello.

628
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,752
Ji Eun!

629
00:42:27,795 --> 00:42:31,549
I can't even give you a tight hug
in case I startle my nephew.

630
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,759
What? "Nephew"?

631
00:42:34,426 --> 00:42:38,305
-Your pregnancy was a secret, right?
-Yu-hyeon, you're such a party pooper.

632
00:42:38,389 --> 00:42:39,390
Yu-hyeon.

633
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:42,601
Pregnancy? What is this about?

634
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,688
Please congratulate us.

635
00:42:47,231 --> 00:42:49,400
I'm happy for you!

636
00:42:49,483 --> 00:42:51,610
That's wonderful news!

637
00:42:55,197 --> 00:42:57,324
I'm truly happy for you.

638
00:42:59,118 --> 00:43:00,953
Let me know if you need anything.

639
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,621
I'll buy anything for your baby.

640
00:43:02,705 --> 00:43:04,873
You're not in the position to spend money.

641
00:43:04,957 --> 00:43:06,250
But thank you.

642
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:08,460
It's okay.
I got my first paycheck yesterday.

643
00:43:08,544 --> 00:43:11,797
You won't be left with much
after I deduct your debt from it.

644
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,010
Had I not met this heinous loan shark,
I would've bought her baby a ton of gifts.

645
00:43:16,093 --> 00:43:17,886
You little--

646
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:19,847
Look.

647
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:22,057
Don't shout. You'll startle my nephew.

648
00:43:22,141 --> 00:43:23,350
Okay.

649
00:43:23,434 --> 00:43:26,145
-It'll be all your fault.
-Goodness.

650
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,315
You're unbelievable.

651
00:43:30,649 --> 00:43:31,942
Are you happy?

652
00:43:41,827 --> 00:43:44,872
What? If you're done eating,
you should leave.

653
00:43:45,539 --> 00:43:46,915
I will.

654
00:43:48,751 --> 00:43:49,793
Here.

655
00:43:50,919 --> 00:43:52,296
What is this?

656
00:43:52,379 --> 00:43:55,924
Ja and Ja from the cafeteria told me

657
00:43:56,008 --> 00:43:58,802
that I should buy my parents something
with my first paycheck.

658
00:43:59,470 --> 00:44:01,930
You don't even have much money.

659
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,515
-Give it back.
-You little punk.

660
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:05,100
I knew it.

661
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:23,577
Did you get this for me to wear?

662
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:26,747
Isn't it pretty?
It's double-layered, so it's very warm.

663
00:44:28,248 --> 00:44:29,083
Bye.

664
00:44:33,504 --> 00:44:34,380
Gosh.

665
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:37,800
Let's see.

666
00:44:38,759 --> 00:44:43,222
I guess the color is very beautiful.

667
00:44:45,933 --> 00:44:49,895
Goodness, you didn't have to get me one.

668
00:44:49,978 --> 00:44:52,856
That's what you're supposed to do
with your first paycheck.

669
00:44:54,817 --> 00:44:57,027
Let's go. I'll drive you home.

670
00:44:57,111 --> 00:44:59,154
It's okay. There's a bus station nearby.

671
00:45:00,197 --> 00:45:02,658
Do you take the bus?

672
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:05,619
You bet. I even mastered subway transfers.

673
00:45:05,702 --> 00:45:10,416
Oh, I see. You're truly incredible.

674
00:45:10,999 --> 00:45:13,669
But the weather is pretty cold today,

675
00:45:14,294 --> 00:45:15,295
so I'll drop you off.

676
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:16,713
Really?

677
00:45:21,635 --> 00:45:23,929
Mister, thank you for the hoodie.

678
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:26,765
Thanks to you, I had a blast today.

679
00:45:26,849 --> 00:45:29,351
I'll cherish this memory
even after I go back.

680
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:31,186
"Go back"? Where to?

681
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:33,147
Oh, she meant…

682
00:45:34,231 --> 00:45:35,315
school.

683
00:45:35,816 --> 00:45:38,318
You go to Hosu High School, right?

684
00:45:39,278 --> 00:45:41,155
Why haven't you been going?

685
00:45:41,238 --> 00:45:42,990
-Well…
-Well…

686
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,910
I have my reasons. Why are you so nosy?

687
00:45:46,994 --> 00:45:47,953
Just go home already.

688
00:45:50,706 --> 00:45:53,876
I'm sorry. She's a bit rude.

689
00:45:53,959 --> 00:45:57,254
It's okay. She reminds me of you
when you were young.

690
00:45:57,963 --> 00:45:59,298
Right.

691
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:03,802
This won't be on the magazine,

692
00:46:03,886 --> 00:46:05,637
but it looked too nice. It's for you.

693
00:46:12,269 --> 00:46:13,937
This really is a nice photo.

694
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,149
-Ha-ni.
-Yes?

695
00:46:18,233 --> 00:46:20,235
Thank you for smiling once again.

696
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:41,423
Blood! I'm bleeding!

697
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:42,674
Blood? Where?

698
00:46:47,012 --> 00:46:50,474
Gosh, you're such a baby.

699
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:53,644
It's really painful and sore.

700
00:46:54,436 --> 00:46:56,813
Why did you wear such high heels?

701
00:46:57,397 --> 00:47:00,108
-Because they're pretty.
-You're already pretty.

702
00:47:00,776 --> 00:47:01,735
I'm aware of that.

703
00:47:02,402 --> 00:47:05,364
By the way,
you didn't look too bad yourself.

704
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,451
So wear some makeup on a daily basis

705
00:47:09,535 --> 00:47:11,537
and style your hair.

706
00:47:12,204 --> 00:47:14,540
It's uncomfortable. And no one cares.

707
00:47:14,623 --> 00:47:16,416
I do.

708
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:22,464
-What?
-Your old self cares about you.

709
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:34,184
Hold on.

710
00:47:36,436 --> 00:47:39,147
Isn't that Blue Bird and that woman?

711
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:43,026
Goodness.

712
00:47:43,110 --> 00:47:45,612
Are you sure you don't need
to go to the hospital?

713
00:47:46,196 --> 00:47:49,366
Maybe it's because I haven't had
greasy food in a while.

714
00:47:49,449 --> 00:47:51,868
It's okay.
Some digestive medicine will do the trick.

715
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,036
You should go.

716
00:47:53,120 --> 00:47:54,288
Okay.

717
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,999
Right, Yu-hyeon.

718
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,043
Here's some extra money for you.

719
00:48:03,297 --> 00:48:06,008
It's okay. I'll be making big bucks soon.
I don't need it.

720
00:48:06,091 --> 00:48:07,926
How will you be doing that?

721
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:09,761
I'm attending the contest.

722
00:48:09,845 --> 00:48:12,639
I'm going to win first place
and snatch all of Dad's money.

723
00:48:13,849 --> 00:48:15,726
Don't be ridiculous.

724
00:48:15,809 --> 00:48:17,936
You were never interested in the company.

725
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:21,607
How about I send you on a trip?

726
00:48:21,690 --> 00:48:23,734
Would you like to go abroad and have fun?

727
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,069
Or is there anything you'd like to learn?

728
00:48:27,904 --> 00:48:30,073
No. I like how things are right now.

729
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:33,952
You like how things are right now?
What do you mean?

730
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,912
How should I put it?

731
00:48:36,496 --> 00:48:40,375
Having a companion
to work towards the same goal

732
00:48:42,502 --> 00:48:43,629
makes me happy.

733
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,967
So stop worrying about me and go.

734
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:50,636
Okay.

735
00:48:51,720 --> 00:48:52,763
Aunt.

736
00:48:56,141 --> 00:48:57,142
Aunt.

737
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,479
You always look after me. Thank you.

738
00:49:01,146 --> 00:49:03,690
How could I not?

739
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:07,444
-Bye.
-Bye.

740
00:49:11,031 --> 00:49:12,199
Bye.

741
00:49:21,833 --> 00:49:23,627
You should be ashamed of yourself.

742
00:49:23,710 --> 00:49:25,587
-You filthy Blue Bird!
-Don't touch him.

743
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,255
What?

744
00:49:28,131 --> 00:49:29,675
What are you talking about?

745
00:49:43,980 --> 00:49:47,901
It's me. I need you to check
Yu-hyeon's progress for the contest.

746
00:49:57,703 --> 00:49:58,870
So…

747
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,665
you thought I was a gigolo all along.

748
00:50:02,332 --> 00:50:03,375
Is that it?

749
00:50:04,543 --> 00:50:06,962
Well, you see…

750
00:50:07,045 --> 00:50:09,423
When we saw you earlier,

751
00:50:09,506 --> 00:50:11,842
she had bought you clothes

752
00:50:11,925 --> 00:50:14,052
-and even gave you money. Right?
-Right.

753
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,470
How dare you?

754
00:50:15,971 --> 00:50:18,515
She's still young, so I get it. But you?

755
00:50:21,143 --> 00:50:23,562
So that's why you drew the line

756
00:50:23,645 --> 00:50:25,480
saying you live in a cheap house.

757
00:50:25,564 --> 00:50:28,859
-So that I wouldn't leech off of you.
-I'm sorry.

758
00:50:28,942 --> 00:50:32,112
It's because she kept
calling you Blue Bird.

759
00:50:32,779 --> 00:50:35,490
Anyway,
I'm sorry about the misunderstanding.

760
00:50:35,991 --> 00:50:38,118
I really had no idea she was your aunt.

761
00:50:39,745 --> 00:50:41,580
It's okay. At least you know now.

762
00:50:42,497 --> 00:50:45,083
By the way, what will we do tomorrow?

763
00:50:45,167 --> 00:50:47,169
We were going to do a survey.

764
00:50:47,252 --> 00:50:50,630
Oh, that? I already called everyone.

765
00:50:51,673 --> 00:50:52,591
Called who?

766
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:54,593
Okay.

767
00:50:56,762 --> 00:50:59,306
-No, I just don't know
-No, I just don't know

768
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:02,225
-You loved me so much
-You loved me so much

769
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,019
Accentuate.

770
00:51:04,102 --> 00:51:06,188
-So why am I shaken up?
-So why am I shaken up?

771
00:51:06,271 --> 00:51:07,189
Accentuate.

772
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,274
-It's not that I hate you
-It's not that I hate you

773
00:51:09,357 --> 00:51:11,067
What is this?

774
00:51:11,151 --> 00:51:13,111
This is irritating. Can't we just leave?

775
00:51:14,029 --> 00:51:16,948
-What is love?
-What is love?

776
00:51:17,032 --> 00:51:18,575
One more time.

777
00:51:18,658 --> 00:51:22,496
-You were devoted to me
-You were devoted to me

778
00:51:22,579 --> 00:51:25,373
-So why am I leaving you?
-So why am I leaving you?

779
00:51:25,457 --> 00:51:28,418
-I just don't know
-I just don't know

780
00:51:28,502 --> 00:51:30,754
-Let's do it again. Go.
-Goodness.

781
00:51:30,837 --> 00:51:31,671
What?

782
00:51:34,007 --> 00:51:35,592
Why are they here?

783
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:39,054
What? I thought you needed
a variety of age groups.

784
00:51:39,137 --> 00:51:43,016
I mean, how did you gather all of them?

785
00:51:43,683 --> 00:51:45,936
I asked the ghost to invite those ladies.

786
00:51:46,019 --> 00:51:48,647
So-hye brought those students.

787
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:51,775
And that man…
I found his business card at home.

788
00:51:51,858 --> 00:51:53,777
He helped you get your money back, right?

789
00:51:54,820 --> 00:51:56,655
You're incredibly nosy.

790
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:59,032
She did gather a variety of people.

791
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,201
-So why am I leaving you?
-So why am I leaving you?

792
00:52:01,284 --> 00:52:03,703
-I just don't know
-I just don't know

793
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:07,332
2080 SINGING CLASS
LET'S ALL BECOME SUPERSTARS

794
00:52:08,959 --> 00:52:11,294
The class is in full swing.

795
00:52:11,378 --> 00:52:12,295
Let's hurry.

796
00:52:12,379 --> 00:52:13,547
Okay.

797
00:52:20,512 --> 00:52:24,516
Thank you so much for making time today.

798
00:52:27,644 --> 00:52:31,231
Please try these snacks

799
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:33,483
and fill out the questionnaire.

800
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:37,279
Your honesty is the most important,

801
00:52:37,362 --> 00:52:41,199
so please write down all the things
that the snacks lack.

802
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,201
PLEASE EVALUATE YOUR SNACK OF CHOICE

803
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,119
100 POINTS

804
00:52:45,787 --> 00:52:47,706
PLEASE LET US KNOW WHY
IT LACKS AN EDGE

805
00:52:51,793 --> 00:52:55,213
Did you read the ones the students wrote?

806
00:52:55,297 --> 00:52:58,508
I think they didn't like the snacks,

807
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:00,135
but I don't get what they wrote.

808
00:53:00,218 --> 00:53:01,469
"It lacks an edge."

809
00:53:01,553 --> 00:53:04,639
"I have a lot to say but CBF."

810
00:53:04,723 --> 00:53:07,183
"Not fun, cool, or sexy."

811
00:53:07,267 --> 00:53:08,518
What do they mean?

812
00:53:08,602 --> 00:53:12,022
What's wrong? I like this one.

813
00:53:12,772 --> 00:53:16,318
"That guy is sweeter than these snacks.
I'll cherish him in my heart."

814
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:18,904
Come on. This isn't a popularity poll.

815
00:53:18,987 --> 00:53:20,030
What's with you?

816
00:53:20,614 --> 00:53:21,615
Anyway…

817
00:53:22,282 --> 00:53:26,328
Just like she said,
they must think the snacks are too boring.

818
00:53:26,411 --> 00:53:29,706
See? I told you. I know my onions
when it comes to snacks.

819
00:53:30,707 --> 00:53:33,293
It's not just the students.

820
00:53:33,376 --> 00:53:37,005
Even the middle-aged ladies said
that the taste wasn't bad,

821
00:53:37,088 --> 00:53:39,090
but everything about the snack
was too bland.

822
00:53:39,174 --> 00:53:41,343
The majority found the snacks boring.

823
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:46,514
It's getting late.

824
00:53:47,515 --> 00:53:48,683
Let's resume tomorrow.

825
00:53:48,767 --> 00:53:50,435
He's right. Let's sleep first.

826
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:52,145
What time is it?

827
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:55,982
Okay, then.
Mr. Blue Bird, you should leave.

828
00:53:56,066 --> 00:53:58,777
I'm not Blue Bird. I'll get going, then.

829
00:54:00,153 --> 00:54:02,072
-Okay.
-You don't need to see me out.

830
00:54:03,198 --> 00:54:05,367
-Good job today.
-You too.

831
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:07,369
Goodnight.

832
00:54:07,452 --> 00:54:09,245
Hey, kid. Goodnight.

833
00:54:09,829 --> 00:54:11,164
Goodbye.

834
00:54:31,434 --> 00:54:33,269
HYEONGJE MART

835
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:36,106
WE ARE UP FOR A CHALLENGE

836
00:54:36,189 --> 00:54:37,691
Put that in.

837
00:54:43,029 --> 00:54:45,699
I wonder what they're up to this time.

838
00:54:45,782 --> 00:54:47,492
Who cares?

839
00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,577
We'll just watch them
and have puffed rice.

840
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:53,331
Every neighborhood
has a couple of eccentrics.

841
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,834
They're not eccentrics.

842
00:54:55,917 --> 00:54:57,919
-They're aliens.
-"Aliens"?

843
00:55:03,258 --> 00:55:05,885
Yeong-gu, this is our 372nd attempt.

844
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:08,847
No, the 373rd. We also tried
holding in our poop last time.

845
00:55:08,930 --> 00:55:11,558
You're right. Let's succeed this time!

846
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:12,892
We must.

847
00:55:12,976 --> 00:55:17,063
We've been working on this machine
day and night for the past month.

848
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:20,775
We'll be sending puffed rice to the moon
for the first time in history.

849
00:55:24,237 --> 00:55:26,990
-Il-gu, put it in.
-Okay!

850
00:55:27,866 --> 00:55:29,784
-They're about to do it.
-Let's see.

851
00:55:34,706 --> 00:55:36,291
On the count of three…

852
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:39,252
Hey, moon rabbit!

853
00:55:39,335 --> 00:55:42,213
Here comes the puffed rice!

854
00:55:42,297 --> 00:55:43,882
-One!
-One!

855
00:55:43,965 --> 00:55:45,008
-Two!
-Two!

856
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,843
-Three!
-Three!

857
00:55:46,926 --> 00:55:48,053
-Puff!
-Puff!

858
00:55:48,136 --> 00:55:49,929
Puff!

859
00:56:21,586 --> 00:56:22,837
That's it.

860
00:56:23,922 --> 00:56:24,881
What?

861
00:56:27,342 --> 00:56:28,843
The snack we're working on.

862
00:56:30,303 --> 00:56:32,097
I've got an idea

863
00:56:33,181 --> 00:56:34,432
on how to make it.

864
00:56:38,520 --> 00:56:40,021
We'll pour puffed rice

865
00:56:41,898 --> 00:56:43,358
on top of our tofu snacks.

866
00:56:45,401 --> 00:56:48,655
Other ingredients could ruin
the taste of tofu.

867
00:56:48,738 --> 00:56:51,032
But puffed rice will complement it.

868
00:56:52,033 --> 00:56:54,661
It'll also add to
the taste and the texture.

869
00:56:55,245 --> 00:56:58,289
It'll make up for the snack's weakness.

870
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:14,389
It'll also bring a sense of nostalgia.

871
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,789
2020 JOA CONFECTIONERY
IDEA CONTEST PRESENTATION

872
00:57:44,544 --> 00:57:48,882
I've been praying for rain
every single day.

873
00:57:49,549 --> 00:57:51,634
But I'll pray for something else today.

874
00:57:51,718 --> 00:57:53,470
Please give courage

875
00:57:53,553 --> 00:57:57,682
to the 37-year-old me
so she can do well on her presentation.

876
00:58:10,737 --> 00:58:11,738
Hold on.

877
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,366
That's my phone.

878
00:58:41,100 --> 00:58:42,644
Hello.

879
00:58:42,727 --> 00:58:46,523
I'm here presenting for team Star Land.
I work for the Product Development Team.

880
00:58:46,606 --> 00:58:49,317
My name is Bahn Ha-ni.

881
00:59:55,300 --> 00:59:57,844
I'll change that destiny or whatever.
You can do it.

882
00:59:57,927 --> 01:00:00,096
-That little boy is Yu-hyeon?
-Yes.

883
01:00:00,179 --> 01:00:01,931
I was so surprised too.

884
01:00:02,015 --> 01:00:04,517
-Cheers!
-I don't remember anything except this.

885
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:06,644
-What's that?
-Ha-ni's smile.

886
01:00:06,728 --> 01:00:07,645
Don't worry.

887
01:00:07,729 --> 01:00:08,771
I'll keep that promise.

888
01:00:08,855 --> 01:00:10,940
You've kept this all along?

889
01:00:11,024 --> 01:00:15,486
It's time. Come here with the girl
