JOA CONFECTIONERY

3
00:00:57,265 --> 00:00:58,892
Goodness. Oh, gosh.

4
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:00,518
Excuse me.

5
00:01:02,645 --> 00:01:04,272
Gosh, I almost got caught.

6
00:01:07,984 --> 00:01:08,902
Bahn Ha-ni?

7
00:01:10,904 --> 00:01:12,947
-Ha-ni, stop right there.
-Darn it.

8
00:01:13,031 --> 00:01:14,157
She caught me.

9
00:01:14,657 --> 00:01:17,202
Bahn Ha-ni! Stop right there!

10
00:01:17,702 --> 00:01:18,745
"Bahn Ha-ni"?

11
00:01:22,457 --> 00:01:23,625
Anthony!

12
00:01:24,793 --> 00:01:25,835
Where is he going?

13
00:01:29,798 --> 00:01:31,549
Why you…

14
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,885
Bahn Ha-ni! Stop right there!

15
00:01:53,655 --> 00:01:54,572
Bahn Ha-ni?

16
00:02:02,038 --> 00:02:04,666
Where did she go?

17
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:24,269
Excuse me, I…

18
00:02:28,273 --> 00:02:29,274
Testicles?

19
00:02:30,233 --> 00:02:31,401
Anthony?

20
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,112
You work here, Testicles?

21
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:38,449
Yes. And will you quit
calling me Testicles?

22
00:02:39,450 --> 00:02:43,121
The company must be a colossal mess
to hire just about anyone.

23
00:02:45,206 --> 00:02:48,376
Anyway, weren't you
after someone just now?

24
00:02:48,877 --> 00:02:50,003
Bahn--

25
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:51,087
The box!

26
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,131
"The box"?

27
00:02:55,592 --> 00:02:56,926
Maybe I heard wrong.

28
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:58,887
JOA CONFECTIONERY

29
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:11,191
Bahn Ha-ni,
just wait until I get home later.

30
00:03:26,539 --> 00:03:27,415
Old lady!

31
00:03:27,916 --> 00:03:29,459
I doubt you're already off work.

32
00:03:29,542 --> 00:03:31,085
I'm heading out for work.

33
00:03:32,712 --> 00:03:33,922
Is it urgent?

34
00:03:34,422 --> 00:03:36,716
Cabs don't come by often at this hour.

35
00:03:47,810 --> 00:03:49,145
Hey, it's me.

36
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,688
SEARCHING FOR TAXI

37
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:04,369
Get in!

38
00:04:05,411 --> 00:04:06,579
SQUID-GOOD

39
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:07,705
CONTAINS REAL SQUID

40
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:18,383
Newbie, if you're done with the dishes,
help peel the garlic.

41
00:04:19,676 --> 00:04:20,551
Who are you?

42
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,934
Greetings.

43
00:04:28,518 --> 00:04:33,231
I'm here to complete
a very important dishwashing mission.

44
00:04:33,731 --> 00:04:34,983
Hello, I'm Cha Seung-seok.

45
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,237
But where's the newbie?

46
00:04:49,956 --> 00:04:53,209
-"Contains real squid"?
-There's squid inside.

47
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,335
What is that?

48
00:04:56,879 --> 00:04:59,590
-Can you close the window?
-I can't.

49
00:05:01,050 --> 00:05:03,594
-Why not?
-It's busted.

50
00:05:05,346 --> 00:05:06,848
Is she the squid?

51
00:05:09,058 --> 00:05:09,892
Here.

52
00:05:12,562 --> 00:05:14,897
Just imagine
we're going on a drive and relax.

53
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,573
What's this Blue Bird up to?

54
00:05:24,073 --> 00:05:26,117
Is he after my money?

55
00:05:36,377 --> 00:05:38,504
I hear there's an issue
at the Anseong factory.

56
00:05:39,005 --> 00:05:41,632
It's being taken care of.
Everything will be sorted by tomorrow.

57
00:05:41,716 --> 00:05:44,927
Wouldn't it be difficult
to prepare the sample product then?

58
00:05:46,304 --> 00:05:48,514
Could it be ready
for the executive meeting?

59
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:52,352
There's no need to worry.
Ms. Oh has it under control.

60
00:05:52,435 --> 00:05:53,269
I see.

61
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:55,772
Here.

62
00:05:56,439 --> 00:05:58,107
I can't. Not while on the clock.

63
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:00,860
I'm offering you a glass as your uncle.

64
00:06:02,403 --> 00:06:03,529
Sure.

65
00:06:07,617 --> 00:06:11,496
It's rude not to have a drink
with this delicious meal.

66
00:06:20,129 --> 00:06:21,214
You're right.

67
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:25,635
Do-yun, do you remember this place?

68
00:06:27,303 --> 00:06:30,973
Of course. It's the place
where you poured me my first drink.

69
00:06:33,142 --> 00:06:35,311
You're my son too in a way.

70
00:06:38,147 --> 00:06:39,524
I'm more than grateful.

71
00:06:40,233 --> 00:06:43,611
Thanks to you,
I never felt the absence of my father.

72
00:06:43,694 --> 00:06:46,447
You grew up well on your own accord.

73
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,619
If only Yu-hyeon
were half the man you are.

74
00:06:53,371 --> 00:06:55,665
He's like a ray of sunshine though.

75
00:06:56,374 --> 00:06:57,208
I don't know.

76
00:06:58,584 --> 00:07:02,380
For some reason, the sight of him laughing

77
00:07:03,381 --> 00:07:04,674
makes my heart sting.

78
00:07:05,675 --> 00:07:06,926
It seems to me

79
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:10,346
that he's forcing himself to smile
after his mother died.

80
00:07:12,765 --> 00:07:17,645
He's probably doing that for your sake.
He's considerate.

81
00:07:17,728 --> 00:07:19,605
Him? Considerate?

82
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:24,444
His temper tantrums
only proves to me how petty he is.

83
00:07:25,903 --> 00:07:27,780
Anyway, that's enough about him.

84
00:07:27,864 --> 00:07:29,240
Let's have another glass.

85
00:07:29,323 --> 00:07:31,075
-Sure.
-Good.

86
00:07:39,083 --> 00:07:40,418
Sorry, I'm late.

87
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:49,427
Did you have a drink?

88
00:07:51,095 --> 00:07:52,638
A little, with the chairman.

89
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:56,559
Before a meeting though?

90
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,686
-You're not even a big drinker.
-I know.

91
00:08:04,275 --> 00:08:06,652
You must be tipsy
judging by how cheery you are.

92
00:08:06,736 --> 00:08:08,654
It's not like that.

93
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:10,656
I'm just happy.

94
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,869
I envy Yu-hyeon
for having such a great father.

95
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:19,373
Well…

96
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:23,044
I envy you for having such a cool mother.

97
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:25,171
Although, she's a little scary.

98
00:08:26,255 --> 00:08:27,548
I mean, a lot.

99
00:08:31,469 --> 00:08:32,678
MOTHER

100
00:08:32,762 --> 00:08:35,640
Speak of the devil, right?

101
00:08:35,723 --> 00:08:36,641
Quiet.

102
00:08:39,393 --> 00:08:40,895
Yes, She-devil.

103
00:08:41,562 --> 00:08:43,523
I mean, Mother.

104
00:08:45,566 --> 00:08:46,442
Of course.

105
00:08:50,696 --> 00:08:52,657
Anthony, is something up?

106
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:54,492
What? It's nothing.

107
00:08:57,703 --> 00:08:58,579
You're in!

108
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,999
What the heck? What do you mean I'm in?

109
00:09:02,083 --> 00:09:05,878
You're one of the three candidates
for the lead role in Ms. Kim's new series.

110
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,384
CRUNCHY SQUID-FLAVORED SNACK
SQUID-GOOD

111
00:09:14,136 --> 00:09:17,807
Squid is good
Deliciously good

112
00:09:17,890 --> 00:09:20,226
Nutritious as well

113
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,354
It has ten legs, a perfect squid

114
00:09:23,854 --> 00:09:28,526
Oh, everybody loves it

115
00:09:29,652 --> 00:09:32,613
Squid, squid, squid

116
00:09:32,697 --> 00:09:34,865
Squid, squid, squid

117
00:09:36,284 --> 00:09:38,369
Squid, squid, squid

118
00:09:38,452 --> 00:09:39,829
Nice. This is the best.

119
00:09:39,912 --> 00:09:41,789
He's done a complete 180.

120
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:47,670
Squid is good
Deliciously good

121
00:09:47,753 --> 00:09:50,464
Nutritious as well

122
00:09:50,548 --> 00:09:53,926
It has ten legs, a perfect squid

123
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:59,056
Oh, everybody loves it

124
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,147
Anthony, that was incredible.

125
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,858
Okay, we'll take a short break.

126
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:13,029
Why is the squid
suddenly in such a good mood?

127
00:10:14,030 --> 00:10:15,615
You killed it just now!

128
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,199
Did I look good on camera?

129
00:10:17,283 --> 00:10:19,285
I had no idea you had that in you.

130
00:10:19,368 --> 00:10:21,120
-Did you see his expressions?
-Yes.

131
00:10:21,704 --> 00:10:24,790
You practically starved yesterday,
so let's eat something.

132
00:10:25,708 --> 00:10:27,418
They even have salad buns.

133
00:10:27,501 --> 00:10:30,588
I wouldn't have worked out
had I known I'd be in this suit.

134
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,177
I'll never stop craving these salad buns.

135
00:10:36,260 --> 00:10:37,386
They're addictive.

136
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:58,532
This is my favorite snack of all time.

137
00:11:02,119 --> 00:11:04,163
-Thanks, ma'am.
-Have a good day.

138
00:11:04,246 --> 00:11:05,081
Come on.

139
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:08,042
This is the best.

140
00:11:08,125 --> 00:11:09,585
I wouldn't mind stuffing myself.

141
00:11:12,254 --> 00:11:13,589
Disgusting.

142
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:18,094
I'll go first. Pay for mine too, okay?

143
00:11:18,177 --> 00:11:19,845
MOM'S SNACKS

144
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,442
Chun-sik, who do you think you are?

145
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,903
Me? I'm the Captain of Hosu High

146
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,655
and you're the queen bee of Hosu High.

147
00:11:38,572 --> 00:11:41,367
Bahn Ha-ni, be my girl.

148
00:11:41,992 --> 00:11:43,077
Idiot.

149
00:11:50,918 --> 00:11:54,672
You're the first girl
to brush me off like this. It's why…

150
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:56,257
I'm drawn to you.

151
00:11:58,175 --> 00:12:00,261
As if this would work on me.

152
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:05,015
Wipe your mouth first
before you yap away like that.

153
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,684
You're disgusting.

154
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,694
Damn!

155
00:12:21,282 --> 00:12:23,033
It's hot in here.

156
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:24,410
-Is it?
-Yes.

157
00:12:29,665 --> 00:12:31,625
Wait, what's with that huge mole?

158
00:12:38,382 --> 00:12:39,425
No way!

159
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:41,844
Is he Yang Chun-sik?

160
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,778
Hi, there. I'm from the headquarters.

161
00:12:58,861 --> 00:12:59,862
Sure, welcome.

162
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,031
We were waiting for you.

163
00:13:02,114 --> 00:13:04,700
These are the ingredients you'll need

164
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:07,495
and the recipe is in this flash drive.

165
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:11,624
Sure. We'll get on it right away.

166
00:13:11,707 --> 00:13:12,875
Thank you.

167
00:13:16,337 --> 00:13:18,297
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

168
00:13:48,369 --> 00:13:50,037
I guess I should thank you.

169
00:13:51,121 --> 00:13:52,248
You even gave me a ride.

170
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,667
At least buy me a meal if you're grateful.

171
00:13:54,750 --> 00:13:56,919
I will once I receive my first paycheck.

172
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:59,922
Nice. I'll be sure
to order something expensive.

173
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:09,974
-Look.
-Yes?

174
00:14:12,643 --> 00:14:15,354
I don't have any money.

175
00:14:17,565 --> 00:14:19,441
I know. You seem that way.

176
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,026
I'll tell you this too.

177
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:24,196
I'm a temp, so I can't even get a loan.

178
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:28,325
My rent is 200,000 won
with only 5 million won deposit.

179
00:14:28,409 --> 00:14:30,953
I also have a kid. She's 17.

180
00:14:31,537 --> 00:14:32,371
I know all that.

181
00:14:33,956 --> 00:14:35,958
But if your daughter's 17,

182
00:14:38,127 --> 00:14:40,296
how old were you when you got pregnant?

183
00:14:42,673 --> 00:14:44,550
Well, I was young.

184
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,552
Who's the dad?

185
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:49,263
-I don't know.
-You don't know?

186
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,725
I never took you for one of those people,

187
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,519
but it seems like you are.

188
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:58,355
Yes, I lived a carefree life.

189
00:14:58,898 --> 00:15:01,358
No wonder your kid…

190
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:04,737
is a brat.

191
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:10,200
Sure thing.

192
00:15:12,620 --> 00:15:13,871
-Anthony.
-Yes?

193
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:15,497
Here's your iced Americano.

194
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:19,001
-It's not a latte, right?
-Of course not.

195
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:25,049
-It's good.
-Isn't it?

196
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:27,468
By the way, did you sort out his schedule?

197
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:28,928
You'll be done by six.

198
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:31,430
The other day,
it took two more hours though.

199
00:15:31,513 --> 00:15:33,974
Will you stop messing around with him?

200
00:15:34,058 --> 00:15:36,143
Think of the old days, darn it.

201
00:15:36,852 --> 00:15:38,228
Go and check again.

202
00:15:38,312 --> 00:15:39,229
Yes, sir.

203
00:15:39,813 --> 00:15:41,065
You'll step over my legs?

204
00:15:42,691 --> 00:15:45,986
Run. Get running!

205
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:50,282
How did it go with Ms. Kim?

206
00:15:50,366 --> 00:15:53,619
I'll get you this role no matter what…

207
00:16:03,921 --> 00:16:04,797
My coffee.

208
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:07,508
-Here.
-Unbelievable.

209
00:16:15,224 --> 00:16:17,726
I really need this role, you know.

210
00:16:26,944 --> 00:16:27,945
What's wrong?

211
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:30,864
I…

212
00:16:30,948 --> 00:16:32,866
-What's happening?
-What's wrong?

213
00:16:35,494 --> 00:16:36,578
What's going on?

214
00:16:37,204 --> 00:16:38,205
Anthony!

215
00:16:43,752 --> 00:16:46,338
-Jeong-man--
-Will you stop farting?

216
00:16:47,798 --> 00:16:50,801
Why do people take dumps
at their workplace?

217
00:16:50,884 --> 00:16:53,262
I can't focus with them coming in and out.

218
00:16:54,471 --> 00:16:57,099
They still get paid
for the time spent on the toilet.

219
00:16:58,434 --> 00:16:59,977
I see.

220
00:17:00,894 --> 00:17:02,980
-That must be why you--
-Seriously?

221
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:06,442
-I've unclogged it.
-Help.

222
00:17:10,279 --> 00:17:13,490
Okay, good.
What's wrong with my stomach today?

223
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:16,535
Anyway, make sure nobody…

224
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:17,995
comes in.

225
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,914
Seeing how he responds to a drop of milk,

226
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:22,541
he sure is Yang Chun-sik.

227
00:17:25,127 --> 00:17:27,337
What did he do to his face though?

228
00:17:28,756 --> 00:17:31,925
Now that his identity's been confirmed,

229
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:34,762
I'll go for the final blow.

230
00:17:35,637 --> 00:17:39,558
Squid, squid, Squid-good

231
00:17:40,142 --> 00:17:41,310
ANTHONY
WAITING ROOM

232
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,982
Gyeong-sik…

233
00:17:48,442 --> 00:17:50,819
Gyeong-sik!

234
00:17:52,071 --> 00:17:53,739
-What is it, Anthony?
-What's wrong?

235
00:17:53,822 --> 00:17:55,074
What's the matter?

236
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,576
What is that?

237
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,832
YANG CHUN-SIK,
I KNOW WHAT YOU DID WHEN YOU WERE 17

238
00:18:10,464 --> 00:18:13,634
Who wrote that?

239
00:18:26,522 --> 00:18:28,732
It's rush hour.
You'll get caught in traffic.

240
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:32,319
We should hurry then.
Thank you for everything.

241
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:36,031
There's a route
that our employees use during rush hour.

242
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,950
Should I tell you?

243
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:39,493
Yes, that would be great.

244
00:18:39,576 --> 00:18:43,914
Drive straight once you leave the factory,
and you'll see a bus stop.

245
00:18:59,221 --> 00:19:00,180
What's going on?

246
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,558
I wonder what's up.

247
00:19:02,641 --> 00:19:04,226
-Someone help him!
-My goodness!

248
00:19:04,893 --> 00:19:07,563
Someone should go down and help him!

249
00:19:07,646 --> 00:19:09,773
-My goodness!
-Oh, dear!

250
00:19:09,857 --> 00:19:12,943
-Why did he go in there? It's dangerous.
-My gosh!

251
00:19:13,026 --> 00:19:15,279
-What's going on?
-My goodness.

252
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:16,572
There! Look!

253
00:19:16,655 --> 00:19:18,282
-My gosh.
-Oh, my goodness.

254
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:21,535
-Someone needs to help!
-What's he doing there?

255
00:19:21,618 --> 00:19:23,537
-Where are you…
-Do something!

256
00:19:23,620 --> 00:19:24,872
-Help him!
-Goodness!

257
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:28,125
-My gosh.
-Where's the help?

258
00:19:28,208 --> 00:19:31,712
He could really die.
Is there a lifebelt nearby?

259
00:19:32,588 --> 00:19:34,298
-Oh, gosh.
-My goodness.

260
00:19:34,381 --> 00:19:36,884
-What are you going to do with this?
-Hurry.

261
00:19:36,967 --> 00:19:38,719
We need to save him.

262
00:19:38,802 --> 00:19:40,262
They called 911.

263
00:19:40,345 --> 00:19:41,722
But they're not here yet.

264
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,727
Go and bring more snacks.

265
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:49,438
Okay. Just a second.

266
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,024
Hurry!

267
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:29,853
Hold on. I'll be right there!

268
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:42,324
NO SWIMMING

269
00:20:53,543 --> 00:20:57,089
Hey, kid! Hey!

270
00:20:57,172 --> 00:20:58,674
Hold onto this. Here.

271
00:20:58,757 --> 00:21:00,634
-That's it!
-There.

272
00:21:00,717 --> 00:21:01,969
-My gosh.
-She did it!

273
00:21:02,052 --> 00:21:03,845
I'm going to push you.

274
00:21:05,389 --> 00:21:06,932
You hold onto this, okay?

275
00:21:07,516 --> 00:21:08,517
You'll be fine.

276
00:21:14,481 --> 00:21:17,109
Hey, kid. Are you okay?

277
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:23,240
I'll give you a push. You go first.

278
00:21:39,172 --> 00:21:40,173
Old Lady.

279
00:22:01,611 --> 00:22:02,612
Dad.

280
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,712
She was brave 20 years ago,

281
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,465
and she still is.

282
00:22:39,566 --> 00:22:42,486
My gosh, Old Lady!
Have you lost your mind?

283
00:22:42,569 --> 00:22:44,279
Do you really think you're Superman?

284
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,656
You could've died!

285
00:22:47,407 --> 00:22:48,450
You're so reckless.

286
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:50,994
What if you really died?

287
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:57,626
They must be madly in love.
She could've died just now.

288
00:22:57,709 --> 00:23:00,670
It's because they're young.
We were just like them.

289
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:06,593
-What are you doing?
-What?

290
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:21,149
We were running low on sugar
because of the shock.

291
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:23,276
What is this snack? It's delicious.

292
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,986
-I was so startled.
-Me too.

293
00:23:34,496 --> 00:23:37,833
Because of what happened,
this is all we have left.

294
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:41,336
Do you really expect me to believe that?

295
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:45,048
If I were in your shoes,
I wouldn't believe it too.

296
00:23:45,632 --> 00:23:47,926
But I swear I'm telling the truth.

297
00:23:48,927 --> 00:23:51,638
I clearly told you

298
00:23:52,305 --> 00:23:56,059
not to make any mistakes
because it's really important.

299
00:23:59,354 --> 00:24:00,981
I'm sorry.

300
00:24:02,899 --> 00:24:04,901
I'm sick of hearing you apologize.

301
00:24:04,985 --> 00:24:07,279
I don't care if you're sorry.
What am I going to do?

302
00:24:10,657 --> 00:24:14,786
Ms. Bahn, can we talk in private?

303
00:24:31,761 --> 00:24:32,888
Hey.

304
00:24:34,264 --> 00:24:35,265
I'm really sorry.

305
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:38,560
Didn't I make myself clear?

306
00:24:38,643 --> 00:24:40,729
Keep your work and private life separate.

307
00:24:41,688 --> 00:24:42,522
I'm sorry.

308
00:24:42,606 --> 00:24:45,442
You're always telling me
that you're sorry.

309
00:24:45,942 --> 00:24:47,819
And it makes you seem so incompetent.

310
00:24:47,903 --> 00:24:51,156
You shouldn't have made a mistake
in the first place.

311
00:24:51,823 --> 00:24:52,866
I'm sorry…

312
00:24:57,954 --> 00:24:59,456
You don't need to apologize.

313
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:02,918
So tell me.
How are you going to take responsibility?

314
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:05,337
Pardon?

315
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:11,676
You must not know this
since you've never had a proper job.

316
00:25:11,760 --> 00:25:14,721
When you do something wrong at work,
you don't just apologize.

317
00:25:14,804 --> 00:25:17,349
You need to take responsibility, okay?

318
00:25:18,725 --> 00:25:21,978
Do I need to teach you everything?

319
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,814
Then what can I do

320
00:25:26,608 --> 00:25:27,943
to take responsibility?

321
00:25:36,368 --> 00:25:39,371
When something's not right for you,

322
00:25:40,747 --> 00:25:43,750
it's best to just give up.

323
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,044
Ms. Oh.

324
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:51,132
If you give me one more chance--

325
00:25:51,216 --> 00:25:53,009
Was that not clear enough?

326
00:25:53,093 --> 00:25:54,553
Then I'll be kind enough

327
00:25:54,636 --> 00:25:58,974
to explain what I really meant
one last time.

328
00:26:01,685 --> 00:26:02,561
Ms. Bahn.

329
00:26:04,688 --> 00:26:06,731
I want you

330
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:09,109
out of my team.

331
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,197
Ms. Oh.

332
00:26:14,281 --> 00:26:16,324
-My goodness.
-Ms. Oh.

333
00:26:16,408 --> 00:26:18,618
What are you doing? Get off me.

334
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,876
What just happened? Are you okay?

335
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:28,712
Why are you still here?

336
00:26:29,212 --> 00:26:32,966
Ma'am, she could have been hurt
if she fell down the stairs.

337
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:36,469
No, I didn't mean to push her on purpose.

338
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:39,806
-It was a mistake--
-Who cares? She could've gotten hurt!

339
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:40,890
Ms. Oh.

340
00:26:42,017 --> 00:26:43,685
I'm really sorry.

341
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:46,354
It's all my fault.

342
00:26:47,188 --> 00:26:50,025
Like you said,
I'll take full responsibility.

343
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:55,071
I promise I'll take responsibility
for what happened.

344
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,240
What do you mean you'll…

345
00:26:57,907 --> 00:26:59,367
Gosh, forget it.

346
00:27:02,662 --> 00:27:06,541
She's pretty, but she's a real witch.

347
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:11,713
I made a mistake,
so she has every right to be angry.

348
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:13,757
You already apologized.

349
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:15,008
When you're an adult,

350
00:27:15,508 --> 00:27:18,470
you can't just get away
with an apology like a child.

351
00:27:18,970 --> 00:27:21,806
You need to take responsibility
for what you did wrong.

352
00:27:21,890 --> 00:27:25,352
Even so,
she looks so much younger than you.

353
00:27:25,435 --> 00:27:27,312
Why did she have to be so rude?

354
00:27:27,395 --> 00:27:30,607
She's not younger than me.
We went to school together.

355
00:27:31,358 --> 00:27:33,568
You went to school together? University?

356
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:36,863
-High school.
-"High school"?

357
00:27:36,946 --> 00:27:38,698
Do I also know her?

358
00:27:40,241 --> 00:27:41,076
Yes.

359
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:43,161
Who is she?

360
00:27:46,790 --> 00:27:47,624
Ji-eun.

361
00:27:49,876 --> 00:27:50,794
What?

362
00:27:52,253 --> 00:27:54,589
That witch was Ji-eun, my best friend?

363
00:27:56,091 --> 00:27:59,678
Ji-eun, what was that back there?

364
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:04,391
Did you forget
that you're a cool and rational person?

365
00:28:08,061 --> 00:28:09,270
Get to your senses.

366
00:28:09,354 --> 00:28:12,565
Get to your senses and be cool, okay?

367
00:28:12,649 --> 00:28:14,234
Wash your face first.

368
00:28:14,317 --> 00:28:15,902
You can't go home like that.

369
00:28:22,283 --> 00:28:24,035
Tell me what happened.

370
00:28:24,119 --> 00:28:28,081
You guys used to be best friends.
What made you fall apart?

371
00:28:35,547 --> 00:28:37,549
Ha-ni!

372
00:28:41,761 --> 00:28:42,679
Ha-ni.

373
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,768
I kept calling you.

374
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:51,396
I was worried because you didn't pick up.

375
00:28:52,272 --> 00:28:53,440
I went to your house

376
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,734
and your mom told me to come here.

377
00:28:59,237 --> 00:29:00,613
How do you feel?

378
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:14,669
I wrote this every day
while you were gone.

379
00:29:16,713 --> 00:29:18,381
I know it's hard right now,

380
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:21,301
but everything will be okay in due time.

381
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:24,053
How is it going to be okay?

382
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,432
-Ha-ni.
-Will my dad come back to life?

383
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:29,142
Or…

384
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:32,979
will I be able to forget the fact
that I made him die?

385
00:29:34,439 --> 00:29:36,775
Tell me! How is it going to be okay?

386
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,404
I'm sorry, Ha-ni. That's not what I meant.

387
00:29:41,488 --> 00:29:43,448
How would you know how I feel?

388
00:29:44,783 --> 00:29:46,701
You're an orphan.

389
00:29:49,329 --> 00:29:50,163
Ha-ni.

390
00:29:53,249 --> 00:29:54,292
Take this back.

391
00:29:55,293 --> 00:29:57,587
Your letters won't make me feel better.

392
00:29:57,670 --> 00:29:59,088
Just go away!

393
00:29:59,172 --> 00:30:02,675
YOU DIDN'T COME TO SCHOOL AGAIN.
OUR FRIENDS ARE REALLY WORRIED.

394
00:30:34,791 --> 00:30:37,627
My gosh, you're unbelievable.

395
00:30:38,127 --> 00:30:42,257
Where have you been looking like that?

396
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,551
It's none of your business.

397
00:30:48,054 --> 00:30:48,888
My gosh.

398
00:30:50,181 --> 00:30:52,267
I had no idea I would end up like this.

399
00:30:53,351 --> 00:30:56,896
But I don't look that awful
thanks to my pretty face.

400
00:30:57,480 --> 00:30:58,982
It's like you have a mustache.

401
00:31:10,577 --> 00:31:11,411
My gosh.

402
00:31:11,494 --> 00:31:12,996
Seriously? My gosh.

403
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:25,800
Bahn Ha-ni?

404
00:31:27,927 --> 00:31:31,764
Come here. I'm warning you.

405
00:31:32,891 --> 00:31:36,811
If you leave the house again,
I swear I'll shave your head.

406
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,773
You really sound like a mom.

407
00:31:41,316 --> 00:31:44,402
Do adults take lectures
on how to scold kids or something?

408
00:31:45,194 --> 00:31:47,530
You're in no position to talk back.

409
00:31:47,614 --> 00:31:48,865
Follow me outside.

410
00:31:56,873 --> 00:31:57,707
"A mom"?

411
00:31:59,667 --> 00:32:04,422
My goodness, was that her…

412
00:32:15,350 --> 00:32:18,394
Stop trying to find part-time jobs.
Stay home from now on.

413
00:32:18,478 --> 00:32:20,605
Then at least buy me a cell phone.

414
00:32:20,688 --> 00:32:22,774
Why do you want one?
You'll be leaving soon.

415
00:32:22,857 --> 00:32:25,818
Who knows when I'll be going back?
I see no signs of rain.

416
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:29,405
And do you know how suffocating it is
to wait in such a tiny ass house?

417
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:31,407
Is your ass this big?

418
00:32:32,325 --> 00:32:35,203
Yes, this is how big my ass is.

419
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:39,374
Let's drop it.

420
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:43,670
I've been through enough today.

421
00:32:56,808 --> 00:32:58,977
Will you stop eating snacks?

422
00:32:59,060 --> 00:33:00,853
You have a fat belly for a reason.

423
00:33:00,937 --> 00:33:03,731
Stop nagging. It's my belly, not yours.

424
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:13,574
"Along with the spring breeze in March,
flowers will bloom,

425
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:16,452
and every flower will attract
bees and butterflies."

426
00:33:16,953 --> 00:33:20,498
Spring breeze, my foot.
It's freezing outside.

427
00:33:24,043 --> 00:33:26,004
What's this? Is there a blackout?

428
00:33:26,713 --> 00:33:29,257
-Turn on the candle.
-Just a second.

429
00:33:31,134 --> 00:33:32,343
Oh, my gosh!

430
00:33:33,970 --> 00:33:35,471
You're scarier than a ghost.

431
00:33:36,639 --> 00:33:38,391
Give me back my leg.

432
00:33:39,017 --> 00:33:41,436
Give me back my leg.

433
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,271
That doesn't scare me one bit.

434
00:33:45,231 --> 00:33:49,652
Will you please stop?
You're like a little kid.

435
00:33:52,321 --> 00:33:53,281
That wasn't me.

436
00:34:18,723 --> 00:34:21,350
There's nothing here.
Are you sure you weren't mistaken?

437
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,436
I have perfect eyesight.

438
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:27,482
I swear I saw a ghost
with really long hair.

439
00:34:29,025 --> 00:34:32,779
I'm sorry.
You're the only neighbor I know.

440
00:34:33,780 --> 00:34:34,989
By the way, do you feel okay?

441
00:34:36,157 --> 00:34:38,242
You didn't have time
to dry your clothes earlier.

442
00:34:38,326 --> 00:34:41,996
If you dress like that,
you'll catch a cold.

443
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,624
You should wear warmer clothes.

444
00:34:45,249 --> 00:34:48,669
What was that? Are you hitting on my mom?

445
00:34:48,753 --> 00:34:50,505
What? Is there a problem with that?

446
00:34:58,221 --> 00:34:59,514
I'm kidding.

447
00:34:59,597 --> 00:35:02,183
You guys seemed really tense
because of the ghost,

448
00:35:02,683 --> 00:35:04,018
so I tried to make you laugh.

449
00:35:05,311 --> 00:35:08,397
Everything seems fine,
so I'll get going now.

450
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,024
Good night.

451
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:15,321
Look at that Blue Bird
trying to act all cool.

452
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:17,573
"The spring breeze.

453
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:22,578
Every flower will attract
bees and butterflies."

454
00:35:24,872 --> 00:35:25,748
No way.

455
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,917
What's with that look?

456
00:35:29,043 --> 00:35:30,044
What do you mean?

457
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:32,463
You look sad

458
00:35:33,506 --> 00:35:36,592
and wistful to let him go.

459
00:35:38,219 --> 00:35:39,345
It's not like that.

460
00:35:39,428 --> 00:35:42,765
Gosh, it's cold. Come inside. I'm scared.

461
00:35:42,849 --> 00:35:45,101
-Come inside.
-This feels ominous.

462
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,022
It sure does.

463
00:36:06,664 --> 00:36:07,874
What do you mean?

464
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,084
You want to postpone
the meeting to the afternoon?

465
00:36:10,751 --> 00:36:13,546
There were some issues yesterday
getting the goods

466
00:36:13,629 --> 00:36:15,631
from the factory in Pocheon.

467
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:19,177
Why did you wait until now to report this?

468
00:36:20,094 --> 00:36:23,639
Taking care of the matter first
seemed more pressing.

469
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,851
So I told him
that we should report it afterward.

470
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:31,439
The factory in Anseong
will deliver the goods before noon,

471
00:36:31,522 --> 00:36:34,567
so there will be no problems
holding the meeting then.

472
00:36:34,650 --> 00:36:36,944
The schedule has been pushed back already.

473
00:36:37,737 --> 00:36:39,363
"There will be no problems"?

474
00:36:41,073 --> 00:36:42,158
I'm sorry, ma'am.

475
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:47,580
-Sir.
-Why are you in a rush?

476
00:36:48,206 --> 00:36:50,208
-It's the news.
-What?

477
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:53,753
This is the stream
where the accident occurred yesterday.

478
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:55,379
Take a look at this footage.

479
00:36:55,463 --> 00:36:57,924
This woman,
an employee at a confectionery company,

480
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:01,010
is saving the student herself
using the snacks…

481
00:37:01,594 --> 00:37:03,012
Wait. That's…

482
00:37:03,095 --> 00:37:05,264
This footage has gone viral online.

483
00:37:05,348 --> 00:37:08,059
Some have commented
on the irony of excessive packaging,

484
00:37:08,142 --> 00:37:11,562
while others claimed that the student
was saved thanks to the snacks.

485
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,314
People are wondering

486
00:37:13,397 --> 00:37:17,693
where they could purchase this snack
that hasn't been released yet--

487
00:37:17,777 --> 00:37:21,280
If it wasn't for those snacks,
who knows what would've happened to him?

488
00:37:21,364 --> 00:37:24,033
It's all thanks to her and her snacks.

489
00:37:24,116 --> 00:37:26,702
I tried the snack, and it was delicious.

490
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:29,038
You're right.
It was my first time trying it…

491
00:37:32,208 --> 00:37:35,002
-Sir?
-Call off the meeting altogether.

492
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,546
-What? Call it off?
-Yes.

493
00:37:37,630 --> 00:37:40,925
And order all the production lines
to make this snack right away.

494
00:37:41,592 --> 00:37:43,469
But we haven't finalized it yet.

495
00:37:44,053 --> 00:37:46,430
The consumers have already vouched for it.

496
00:37:47,014 --> 00:37:50,810
Minimize the nitrogen gas
and increase the quantity

497
00:37:50,893 --> 00:37:52,603
and promote the snack using that.

498
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:54,689
Yes, sir.

499
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:58,734
You go first.

500
00:38:00,403 --> 00:38:02,488
I told her to take the bull by the horns,

501
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,533
and she even saved someone.

502
00:38:07,159 --> 00:38:09,620
What a fascinating woman she is.

CONFECTIONERY EMPLOYEE SAVES CHILD

506
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:21,382
Who in the world is she?

507
00:38:22,383 --> 00:38:24,719
She's the one the chairman hired

508
00:38:24,802 --> 00:38:28,055
for our Product Development Team.

509
00:38:29,223 --> 00:38:30,141
The chairman?

510
00:38:32,226 --> 00:38:33,686
Where did he find her?

511
00:38:34,270 --> 00:38:38,274
She was a contract worker
who helped out during promotional events.

512
00:38:38,357 --> 00:38:40,401
"Promotional events"?

513
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:46,407
What in the world is he thinking?

514
00:38:51,287 --> 00:38:53,456
-You may leave.
-Yes, ma'am.

515
00:38:55,374 --> 00:38:58,377
I'm sorry for disappointing you, Mother.

516
00:39:01,422 --> 00:39:03,007
This is our workplace.

517
00:39:06,385 --> 00:39:07,470
Yes, ma'am.

518
00:39:13,934 --> 00:39:15,686
Did you look into it?

LETTER OF RESIGNATION

520
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:33,329
Ms. Oh,
were you able to push back the meeting?

521
00:39:33,412 --> 00:39:36,040
The goods will be here before noon.

522
00:39:37,958 --> 00:39:40,336
Is there a problem?

523
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:51,055
Congratulations, Ms. Bahn.

524
00:39:53,182 --> 00:39:54,350
You scored big this time.

525
00:40:00,648 --> 00:40:01,982
Yes, ma'am.

526
00:40:02,566 --> 00:40:04,110
I'll see you then.

527
00:40:04,652 --> 00:40:05,778
Thank you.

528
00:40:07,321 --> 00:40:10,032
Anthony.
Ms. Kim wants to see you next week.

529
00:40:10,116 --> 00:40:13,619
Gosh. I think you will get the role.

530
00:40:14,453 --> 00:40:15,287
Jeong-man.

531
00:40:16,372 --> 00:40:17,748
Before we meet with her,

532
00:40:17,832 --> 00:40:19,750
we have to catch the blackmailer.

533
00:40:20,501 --> 00:40:22,002
I should be known forever

534
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:25,131
as the naturally handsome Anthony,
not Yang Chun-sik.

535
00:40:25,214 --> 00:40:27,967
You bet. The moment
everyone finds out about your past,

536
00:40:28,050 --> 00:40:31,053
your role and everything
you had will go up in flames.

537
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:34,473
-What about the security footage?
-Here he comes.

538
00:40:34,557 --> 00:40:36,976
Anthony. I got it.

539
00:40:43,274 --> 00:40:45,109
Hold on. What's that?

540
00:40:45,192 --> 00:40:46,569
Isn't that her?

541
00:40:46,652 --> 00:40:49,530
Hey, wait. That's her, isn't it?

542
00:40:49,613 --> 00:40:52,324
-Who?
-The kelp.

543
00:40:54,827 --> 00:40:55,953
Or was it seaweed?

544
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:58,164
I got you.

545
00:40:58,664 --> 00:41:00,708
Scarlett, good job.

546
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:02,293
KING STAR AGENCY

547
00:41:02,376 --> 00:41:05,337
I'm only paying you in cash
since you just came from America

548
00:41:05,421 --> 00:41:07,298
and don't have a bank account yet.

549
00:41:12,136 --> 00:41:13,053
See you again soon.

550
00:41:18,309 --> 00:41:21,103
Hey, kid. Can you spare a minute?

551
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:25,691
-My gosh.
-No way.

552
00:41:25,774 --> 00:41:27,485
So it actually works.

553
00:41:28,068 --> 00:41:31,489
I heard kids learn to swim using snacks
and thought it was ridiculous.

554
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,825
Ms. Bahn.
You're more valiant than I thought.

555
00:41:34,909 --> 00:41:37,161
How did you jump in like that?

556
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,872
Everyone's crazy online as well.

557
00:41:39,955 --> 00:41:41,916
The seven most-searched keywords

558
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:44,126
are about our company.

559
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,546
All the marts and convenience stores
are queuing up for our snack.

560
00:41:47,630 --> 00:41:49,465
We've hit the jackpot.

561
00:41:50,090 --> 00:41:51,091
Not really.

562
00:41:51,175 --> 00:41:54,261
We did all the hard work,
and someone else got the credit.

563
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,679
Who cares?

564
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,265
I was in sales before
so I know how hard promotion is.

565
00:41:58,349 --> 00:42:02,520
Anyway, thanks to Ms. Bahn,
this snack will become a hit.

566
00:42:02,603 --> 00:42:03,437
I agree.

567
00:42:04,313 --> 00:42:06,774
Ms. Oh, did you see her video?

568
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,609
It has over 300,000 views.

569
00:42:12,488 --> 00:42:15,658
Aren't you supposed
to be working right now?

570
00:42:15,741 --> 00:42:17,159
Go on, then.

571
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:20,287
Back to work.

572
00:42:27,253 --> 00:42:28,504
Hello, sir.

573
00:42:29,797 --> 00:42:32,091
Who here is busy today?

574
00:42:32,174 --> 00:42:34,176
-All right.
-Good.

575
00:42:34,260 --> 00:42:35,928
That's it.

576
00:42:36,011 --> 00:42:40,766
Thanks to our leader and the director,
we get to have beef.

577
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,228
All right.
Would you like to say a few words, Ms. Oh?

578
00:42:44,311 --> 00:42:45,312
Should I?

579
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:49,024
I'm sure you all know

580
00:42:49,108 --> 00:42:52,111
that our new product launch
has become very promising

581
00:42:52,194 --> 00:42:56,448
thanks to its sudden
and unexpected popularity.

582
00:42:56,532 --> 00:42:57,366
Right.

583
00:42:58,158 --> 00:43:00,119
But you see,

584
00:43:01,287 --> 00:43:05,124
I don't believe
this was all thanks to just one person.

585
00:43:07,543 --> 00:43:12,881
I believe we reaped this fruit
thanks to all of your hard work.

586
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:17,136
-I agree.
-Great job, everyone.

587
00:43:18,304 --> 00:43:20,222
Shall we clink our glasses now?

588
00:43:20,306 --> 00:43:21,348
-Okay.
-Okay.

589
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:23,434
Snacks for three-year-olds...

590
00:43:23,517 --> 00:43:25,060
-To 80-year-olds.
-To 80-year-olds.

591
00:43:25,144 --> 00:43:28,522
-Joa is the best!
-Joa is the best!

592
00:43:33,068 --> 00:43:36,947
Ms. Bahn. You're quite the drinker.
How much do you drink?

593
00:43:37,031 --> 00:43:39,199
Just a bit.

594
00:43:39,283 --> 00:43:40,909
I doubt that.

595
00:43:40,993 --> 00:43:42,911
I know a drinker when I see one.

596
00:43:42,995 --> 00:43:44,913
-Let me.
-No, let me.

597
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:49,460
Due to our hectic schedule,
we couldn't even give you a welcome party.

598
00:43:49,543 --> 00:43:51,712
Thank you for your hard work.

599
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:57,343
You sure know how to treat your alcohol.

600
00:43:57,426 --> 00:44:00,095
-Look at that.
-Ms. Bahn, look here.

601
00:44:00,179 --> 00:44:01,555
One, two, three.

602
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:04,683
Good. Can I post this online?

603
00:44:04,767 --> 00:44:05,726
What?

604
00:44:07,603 --> 00:44:08,979
Come on.

605
00:44:09,063 --> 00:44:11,607
Don't you know how famous you are?

606
00:44:11,690 --> 00:44:14,234
People call you
Joa Confectionery's Michael Phelps.

607
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:15,194
Jeez.

608
00:44:16,403 --> 00:44:19,531
-Could I get one with you too?
-Sure.

609
00:44:19,615 --> 00:44:22,201
You copy everything I do. I hate it.

610
00:44:22,284 --> 00:44:24,536
One, two, three.

611
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:27,122
That's enough. Let's drink.

612
00:44:27,206 --> 00:44:28,916
-We came here to drink.
-Fine.

613
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,209
Let's clink our glasses.

614
00:44:30,292 --> 00:44:31,710
Good work, everyone.

615
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:33,379
-Great job.
-Thank you.

616
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:37,675
Gosh, I'm getting drunk.

617
00:44:38,592 --> 00:44:42,137
Gosh. You can really hold your liquor.

618
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:46,850
Well, I think you could outdrink Ms. Oh.

619
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,019
Right?

620
00:44:49,728 --> 00:44:51,146
She's second to none.

621
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:58,862
Hey, kid.

622
00:44:59,822 --> 00:45:02,866
Do you know what defamation is?

623
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:08,455
I don't know what you've heard from who,

624
00:45:08,539 --> 00:45:12,000
but if you blabber nonsense
about Anthony being Yang Chun-sik…

625
00:45:12,084 --> 00:45:17,464
Spreading groundless rumors like that
could get you into serious trouble.

626
00:45:18,507 --> 00:45:22,886
Are you threatening me right now?

627
00:45:23,762 --> 00:45:26,432
What? You're the one
who threatened us first.

628
00:45:26,515 --> 00:45:29,935
We caught you on camera
running away after leaving that message!

629
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:32,104
Hey, shut it!

630
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,649
How dare you shout at her like that.

631
00:45:35,733 --> 00:45:39,153
Did Chun-sik tell you guys
to intimidate me?

632
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:40,279
Stop calling him that.

633
00:45:40,362 --> 00:45:42,531
I mean, Chun-sik is…

634
00:45:42,614 --> 00:45:46,952
I mean, Anthony is from abroad
and naturally good-looking.

635
00:45:47,035 --> 00:45:48,537
He never went under the knife.

636
00:45:48,620 --> 00:45:51,206
And he was never
a troublemaker at Hosu High School.

637
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:57,463
I never said he went there.

638
00:45:57,546 --> 00:45:59,423
Stop speaking nonsense.

639
00:45:59,506 --> 00:46:01,467
You might as well just leave. Go.

640
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:06,722
I wasn't going to go this far,
but I have no choice.

641
00:46:12,644 --> 00:46:15,981
Tell Chun-sik… No. Tell Mr. Anthony

642
00:46:16,565 --> 00:46:18,066
that if he keeps this up,

643
00:46:19,109 --> 00:46:22,571
I'll spread his photos
and tell everyone about him!

644
00:46:26,366 --> 00:46:27,576
Where…

645
00:46:29,161 --> 00:46:30,037
did you get this?

646
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,164
I have plenty of photos.

647
00:46:32,956 --> 00:46:36,502
So you can just keep that one.

648
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:42,758
Gosh…

649
00:46:43,675 --> 00:46:45,093
Anthony.

650
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:47,721
-Did she leave?
-Come here quickly.

651
00:46:48,555 --> 00:46:49,890
Anthony.

652
00:47:03,403 --> 00:47:04,238
This is nice.

653
00:47:12,371 --> 00:47:15,290
Hey, go first. Go on, now.

654
00:47:16,917 --> 00:47:20,379
-There are so many of them.
-I want a funny one.

655
00:47:20,462 --> 00:47:21,463
How about this?

656
00:47:23,674 --> 00:47:24,508
How do I look?

657
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:26,927
-Here. Wear this.
-This?

658
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:29,930
-You should wear one too.
-Sure.

659
00:47:31,265 --> 00:47:33,725
Ji-eun. Hurry up.

660
00:47:38,355 --> 00:47:41,066
-What are you doing here?
-I'm visiting my girlfriend.

661
00:47:41,149 --> 00:47:43,277
Come on. Get lost.

662
00:47:53,954 --> 00:47:54,955
Bahn Ha-ni?

663
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,666
Jeong-man, find out where she lives.

664
00:47:58,166 --> 00:48:00,294
-Where she lives?
-Hurry up!

665
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:06,133
-More beer.
-Here.

666
00:48:06,216 --> 00:48:07,259
No, I got it.

667
00:48:14,349 --> 00:48:15,809
Ms. Oh.

668
00:48:15,893 --> 00:48:16,894
-Ms. Oh.
-How about it?

669
00:48:17,811 --> 00:48:20,063
Want to make a bet for lunch tomorrow?

670
00:48:20,147 --> 00:48:22,691
-What's the menu?
-The winner can choose.

671
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:23,692
I'm down.

672
00:48:23,775 --> 00:48:26,278
Come on. Ms. Oh will obviously win.

673
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:29,281
-She hates losing.
-You don't know that.

674
00:48:29,781 --> 00:48:33,869
People like Ms. Bahn,
who look like they've been through a lot,

675
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:36,121
are always heavy drinkers.

676
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:54,473
Let's go, Joa!

677
00:48:58,727 --> 00:49:01,647
-Look at you!
-Nice!

678
00:49:05,901 --> 00:49:09,029
Even I don't know why I feel this way

679
00:49:09,112 --> 00:49:11,657
I don't know, there's no way to tell

680
00:49:11,740 --> 00:49:15,035
You loved me so dearly

681
00:49:15,118 --> 00:49:18,455
I don't know why I'm being swayed

682
00:49:18,538 --> 00:49:22,334
I didn't even fall out of love with you

683
00:49:22,417 --> 00:49:24,086
I really don't--

684
00:49:24,169 --> 00:49:26,463
You should only sing the first verse.

685
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:31,134
-This is the etiquette for karaokes?
-I apologize.

686
00:49:31,218 --> 00:49:33,345
It's just been so long.

687
00:49:37,432 --> 00:49:42,688
You're the only one I love

688
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,235
Why can't you believe me?

689
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:55,325
-I will love you until the day I die
-I envy you.

690
00:50:00,956 --> 00:50:02,290
INTERLUDE SKIPPED

691
00:50:05,168 --> 00:50:07,087
It's the karaoke etiquette.

692
00:50:09,339 --> 00:50:12,676
My man has a killer body

693
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,304
You're my man

694
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:20,142
-Let's go out there.
-No. You go ahead.

695
00:50:20,225 --> 00:50:23,645
I'd like to wake up
In the morning together

696
00:50:23,729 --> 00:50:28,108
You're the only one I love

697
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,402
Why can't you believe me?

698
00:50:30,485 --> 00:50:32,404
Since it was a draw, how about a new bet?

699
00:50:32,487 --> 00:50:35,073
-What are we betting on?
-The points.

700
00:50:35,157 --> 00:50:36,450
-I love you!
-Who scores higher.

701
00:50:36,533 --> 00:50:38,368
-Deal!
-All right!

702
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:42,581
-Even if I die
-Even if I die

703
00:50:42,664 --> 00:50:46,752
-I love you
-I love you

704
00:50:47,335 --> 00:50:53,717
-Stay by my side forever
-Stay by my side forever

705
00:50:54,217 --> 00:51:00,807
-I want you to fulfill my dream
-I want you to fulfill my dream

706
00:51:00,891 --> 00:51:07,731
-Hear me out
-Hear me out

707
00:51:08,315 --> 00:51:13,945
-You will be my one and only
-You will be my one and only

708
00:51:14,529 --> 00:51:17,699
-My one and only
-My one and only

709
00:51:19,493 --> 00:51:21,495
-A hundred points!
-My goodness!

710
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:37,511
Oh, gosh.

711
00:51:52,150 --> 00:51:54,319
Do you not have…

712
00:51:56,238 --> 00:51:57,531
any pride?

713
00:51:58,198 --> 00:52:00,575
After being humiliated by me,

714
00:52:00,659 --> 00:52:03,203
you still had the courage to come here?

715
00:52:08,208 --> 00:52:11,711
That's because I'm also a member
of the Product Development Team.

716
00:52:12,838 --> 00:52:13,797
At least for now.

717
00:52:15,340 --> 00:52:18,301
"Member of the Product Development Team,"
my foot.

718
00:52:19,010 --> 00:52:23,265
You lucked out
while working at the supermarket.

719
00:52:23,348 --> 00:52:24,182
I know

720
00:52:24,808 --> 00:52:27,519
that I'm not good enough

721
00:52:28,645 --> 00:52:30,522
for your team.

722
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:32,357
But

723
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:38,280
I'm going to put my heart into this.

724
00:52:40,198 --> 00:52:41,199
So, please

725
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,035
give me a chance.

726
00:52:46,329 --> 00:52:47,247
Is this

727
00:52:49,416 --> 00:52:50,917
because of your daughter?

728
00:52:51,418 --> 00:52:53,962
That girl I saw yesterday…
She's your daughter, right?

729
00:52:57,591 --> 00:53:01,219
She's the spitting image of you.

730
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:04,848
She's the reason why you're putting up

731
00:53:04,931 --> 00:53:06,850
with all this humiliation, right?

732
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:09,019
Yes.

733
00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,438
It's all for her.

734
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:15,233
I'll be honest.
Before she came into my life,

735
00:53:15,734 --> 00:53:19,404
I was quick to give up
and didn't care much about my life.

736
00:53:19,487 --> 00:53:22,699
But I don't want to be an embarrassment

737
00:53:23,283 --> 00:53:25,785
to her anymore.

738
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:28,121
So, please…

739
00:53:29,164 --> 00:53:31,917
Please give me one chance.

740
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:36,379
I'll do my utmost best
to grow as an individual

741
00:53:38,673 --> 00:53:39,925
who befits your team.

742
00:53:51,978 --> 00:53:54,147
I thought everything had changed.

743
00:53:55,357 --> 00:54:00,445
I thought the once radiant Bahn Ha-ni
was long gone.

744
00:54:02,322 --> 00:54:03,365
So why?

745
00:54:05,325 --> 00:54:07,452
Why are you radiating once again

746
00:54:09,579 --> 00:54:10,455
like you did…

747
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,626
twenty years ago?

748
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:23,677
So who are these people

749
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:26,263
that Chairman Han met with?

750
00:54:27,222 --> 00:54:29,349
They're management specialists.

751
00:54:29,432 --> 00:54:30,976
"Management specialists"?

752
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:35,480
He's been secretly in touch
with former CEOs through a headhunter.

753
00:54:36,773 --> 00:54:39,484
Could he be…

754
00:54:43,947 --> 00:54:45,448
You should see this as well.

755
00:54:48,910 --> 00:54:50,161
What is this?

756
00:54:50,245 --> 00:54:53,206
It's Chairman Han's medical record
from the hospital he visits.

757
00:55:33,788 --> 00:55:36,750
-Bahn Ha-ni!
-Bahn Ha-ni!

758
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,993
Goodness.
She will be crawling home anytime soon.

759
00:56:17,791 --> 00:56:18,792
Old lady!

760
00:56:21,920 --> 00:56:22,754
Hey…

761
00:56:24,839 --> 00:56:27,675
Don't be afraid

762
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:32,889
-Old lady.
-To hide your love from me

763
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,933
-Your worrisome…
-Hey, old lady.

764
00:56:36,643 --> 00:56:37,936
Why are you so drunk?

765
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:40,271
It's the Blue Bird.

766
00:56:40,855 --> 00:56:44,609
Come here. Let's dance together!

767
00:56:45,693 --> 00:56:50,031
Well, you look very happy today.

768
00:56:50,115 --> 00:56:54,160
I'm on cloud nine.

769
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:56,746
Why? Did you win the lottery?

770
00:56:56,830 --> 00:56:58,498
No.

771
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:04,838
Maybe it's a lot better than that.

772
00:57:05,463 --> 00:57:07,674
"A lot better"? What is it?

773
00:57:09,008 --> 00:57:13,930
For the first time in 20 years,
I was awesome.

774
00:57:14,514 --> 00:57:17,600
And I didn't run away like a coward.

775
00:57:18,101 --> 00:57:21,229
I was super confident.

776
00:57:22,272 --> 00:57:23,106
Okay. Well,

777
00:57:23,690 --> 00:57:26,776
I don't really know
what's going on, but good job.

778
00:57:26,860 --> 00:57:28,903
You're super awesome.

779
00:57:34,492 --> 00:57:35,660
What is it?

780
00:57:36,870 --> 00:57:38,163
Thank you.

781
00:57:38,788 --> 00:57:39,622
For what?

782
00:57:40,248 --> 00:57:45,170
For telling me that I'm awesome right now.

783
00:57:47,380 --> 00:57:50,800
Because it's totally true.

784
00:57:53,219 --> 00:57:54,512
I feel great.

785
00:57:57,432 --> 00:57:59,601
Then can I sing once more?

786
00:58:00,602 --> 00:58:01,436
Sure.

787
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:10,528
Stay by my side forever

788
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,448
Hear me out

789
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:16,034
You will be…

790
00:58:21,748 --> 00:58:22,957
Old lady!

791
00:58:35,053 --> 00:58:37,222
This is the way to my house.

792
00:58:38,014 --> 00:58:39,098
Are you awake now?

793
00:58:40,433 --> 00:58:42,352
Should I put you down?

794
00:58:44,270 --> 00:58:45,730
It's warm.

795
00:58:48,149 --> 00:58:49,901
This reminds me of my dad.

796
00:58:52,153 --> 00:58:54,781
Did he give you piggyback rides often?

797
00:58:55,740 --> 00:58:56,574
Yes.

798
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:01,412
He would give me a piggyback ride

799
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,416
and sing to me every day.

800
00:59:06,751 --> 00:59:07,794
What song?

801
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,134
What song?

802
00:59:17,637 --> 00:59:19,430
What? Are you asleep?

803
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:43,788
We should take another walk
around the block.

804
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:31,085
Hello? Excuse me.

805
01:00:32,879 --> 01:00:33,880
Excuse me.

806
01:00:34,714 --> 01:00:35,882
I have a question.

807
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:38,301
Gosh, I'm busy right now. What is it?

808
01:01:26,099 --> 01:01:28,643
How long have I walked
with her on my back?

809
01:01:28,726 --> 01:01:29,644
My back hurts.

810
01:01:29,727 --> 01:01:32,438
Bahn Ha-ni, the Lee Hyo-ri of Hosu High?

811
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,899
My Ha-ni?

812
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:37,777
How do you know
what she looked like in high school?

813
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:40,405
-Because I've met her then.
-You met my mom?

814
01:01:40,488 --> 01:01:41,447
A contest?

815
01:01:41,531 --> 01:01:43,533
Last year,
the first prize was 5 million won.

816
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:46,202
-But it's 10 million won this year.
-How much?

817
01:01:46,953 --> 01:01:48,705
Tell me honestly.

818
01:01:48,788 --> 01:01:50,540
What have you gotten yourself into?

819
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:54,544
