EPISODE 7

2
00:01:04,647 --> 00:01:07,233
What the hell? Did you get my mom drunk?

3
00:01:07,317 --> 00:01:09,402
No, her team went out for drinks today.

4
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:13,031
Why is she on your back then?

5
00:01:16,826 --> 00:01:18,411
I bumped into her on the street.

6
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:19,996
Wait. Darn it.

7
00:01:22,165 --> 00:01:24,125
Anyway, I saved her from tripping.

8
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:26,795
-Take this.
-What?

9
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,466
She'll wake up tomorrow
with a terrible hangover,

10
00:01:31,549 --> 00:01:32,801
so make sure she takes it.

11
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:36,679
Why would you get this for her though?

12
00:01:36,763 --> 00:01:37,847
Do you…

13
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:40,642
like my mom?

14
00:01:41,309 --> 00:01:43,561
Me? Like who?

15
00:01:44,395 --> 00:01:47,190
-The old lady?
-I warned you before.

16
00:01:47,273 --> 00:01:48,775
My mom is off-limits!

17
00:01:48,858 --> 00:01:50,693
What? As if I'd ever.

18
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,070
You are Blue Bird after all.

19
00:01:53,446 --> 00:01:55,240
What? "Blue Bird"?

20
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:58,952
Why do you keep calling me that?

21
00:01:59,619 --> 00:02:00,912
A Blue Bird Has It.

22
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:03,123
Don't you know the TV series?

23
00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:05,875
A gigolo like you is portrayed in it.

24
00:02:06,876 --> 00:02:07,877
A gigolo?

25
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:11,047
That TV series aired ages ago!

26
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:13,466
What?

27
00:02:15,468 --> 00:02:16,970
-It's Blue Bird.
-What?

28
00:02:42,245 --> 00:02:45,456
It must be the rooftop apartment.
I'll go and get the photo.

29
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:48,042
-No, let me.
-You'll do it yourself?

30
00:02:48,126 --> 00:02:49,919
There's something I want to check.

31
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:53,047
What is there to check?
All you need is that photo.

32
00:02:54,007 --> 00:02:56,801
It was a sticker photo of me and Ha-ni.

33
00:02:57,802 --> 00:03:00,305
The girl must know Ha-ni in some way.

34
00:03:02,015 --> 00:03:05,268
Hold on a second. Are you saying…

35
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:06,186
Hey!

36
00:03:07,437 --> 00:03:10,023
Anthony, this isn't the time for romance!

37
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:12,275
Answer me!

38
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:14,319
Romance won't put food on the table!

39
00:03:26,623 --> 00:03:29,709
Hello? Excuse me.

40
00:03:31,044 --> 00:03:34,088
Excuse me. I have a question.

41
00:03:34,172 --> 00:03:36,799
Gosh, I'm busy right now. What is it?

42
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:45,850
You. You're the prick from the boutique.

43
00:03:45,934 --> 00:03:47,810
Hey, it's you.

44
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,356
What brings you by though?

45
00:03:54,776 --> 00:03:56,694
Mister, this is all that we have…

46
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:58,863
What the hell?

47
00:03:59,822 --> 00:04:01,491
How did you get here?

48
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,371
Bahn Ha-ni?

49
00:04:08,706 --> 00:04:11,501
How can you be here?

50
00:04:11,584 --> 00:04:15,129
Do you two know each other?
Why did he call you by your mom's name?

51
00:04:17,257 --> 00:04:18,341
Your mom?

52
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:23,304
Wait, are you…
Are you Bahn Ha-ni's daughter?

53
00:04:29,686 --> 00:04:32,021
I'm thirsty. Give me some water.

54
00:04:35,275 --> 00:04:36,442
I…

55
00:04:37,402 --> 00:04:38,569
Hold on. You're Testicles.

56
00:04:40,780 --> 00:04:42,031
You…

57
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:46,828
Wait a second. It's washed-up Anthony.

58
00:04:46,911 --> 00:04:48,621
Why are you at my house?

59
00:04:48,705 --> 00:04:50,915
I already apologized for everything!

60
00:04:53,209 --> 00:04:54,544
Do you know them both?

61
00:05:03,052 --> 00:05:04,721
Are you kidding me?

62
00:05:04,804 --> 00:05:07,515
Just how wasted are you?

63
00:05:08,266 --> 00:05:09,559
Damn it!

64
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,361
She's…

65
00:05:21,821 --> 00:05:22,947
Bahn Ha-ni?

66
00:05:31,414 --> 00:05:33,750
What the hell? Why did he come here?

67
00:05:35,209 --> 00:05:38,004
Anthony's first love
was called the Lee Hyo-ri of Hosu High?

68
00:05:38,087 --> 00:05:42,175
That's right. I heard
she was stunning and popular.

69
00:05:43,301 --> 00:05:44,719
Why did they break up then?

70
00:05:44,802 --> 00:05:46,721
They never actually dated.

71
00:05:46,804 --> 00:05:48,264
He just had a crush on her.

72
00:05:48,348 --> 00:05:51,476
But even actresses fall at his feet now.

73
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,020
Anthony.

74
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,733
Hey. Anthony?

75
00:06:00,777 --> 00:06:01,903
Hey, hold on.

76
00:06:02,945 --> 00:06:05,073
-Anthony, are you all right?
-Are you okay?

77
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,076
My Ha-ni…

78
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,412
What happened up there?

79
00:06:11,496 --> 00:06:13,373
How many fingers do I have up?

80
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:19,379
My Ha-ni…

81
00:06:22,090 --> 00:06:22,924
is Testicles.

82
00:06:25,426 --> 00:06:26,552
What?

83
00:06:27,136 --> 00:06:29,680
Testicles. Testicles!

84
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:32,517
Damn it.

85
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:34,727
Seriously?

86
00:06:35,728 --> 00:06:37,480
This is dowdy. What else do you have?

87
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,649
Wear the one covered in barf then.

88
00:06:41,818 --> 00:06:44,695
Don't just wash those.
Have them dry-cleaned.

89
00:06:45,446 --> 00:06:48,324
-They're expensive.
-Jeez. Must you be so fussy?

90
00:06:48,408 --> 00:06:51,244
By the way, that man from earlier.

91
00:06:52,995 --> 00:06:55,665
-How do you know him?
-We went to the same…

92
00:06:57,708 --> 00:06:58,543
What?

93
00:06:59,127 --> 00:07:00,962
I mean, I heard from Mom

94
00:07:01,045 --> 00:07:03,339
that they went to the same high school.

95
00:07:06,676 --> 00:07:08,428
No wonder he was so shocked to see you.

96
00:07:09,011 --> 00:07:13,474
It's true that you're the spitting image
of her younger self.

97
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:17,353
How do you know what
she looked like in high school?

98
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:18,896
Because I met her then.

99
00:07:19,814 --> 00:07:22,316
We did? I mean, you met my mom?

100
00:07:24,026 --> 00:07:25,319
When?

101
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,908
Back in the day,
I was being picked on by an ugly bully.

102
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,871
And suddenly, a girl came and saved me,

103
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:37,081
calling herself Superman.

104
00:07:40,376 --> 00:07:41,502
It turned out…

105
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,422
to be her.

106
00:07:56,642 --> 00:07:58,603
By the way, what's your name?

107
00:07:58,686 --> 00:07:59,979
My name?

108
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:04,734
I'm Superman who saved you
from those villains.

109
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:05,943
"Superman"?

110
00:08:09,822 --> 00:08:10,823
That crybaby?

111
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,326
The one who cried
after having his necklace stolen?

112
00:08:13,409 --> 00:08:14,744
Yes, that's right.

113
00:08:15,369 --> 00:08:17,205
Wait. How do you know that though?

114
00:08:18,581 --> 00:08:21,417
You're the crybaby I saw a few days ago?

115
00:08:21,501 --> 00:08:22,585
No way!

116
00:08:24,587 --> 00:08:25,421
A few days ago?

117
00:08:27,381 --> 00:08:31,636
No, you heard me wrong.
My mom told me a few days ago.

118
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:35,056
Anyway, get going. I need to go to sleep.

119
00:08:35,139 --> 00:08:36,265
Hey!

120
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:39,352
Have them dry-cleaned.

121
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:42,939
Get out. Leave. Go!

122
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,865
That was close.

123
00:08:53,449 --> 00:08:55,284
You and your big mouth.

124
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:58,788
Why the hell was Chun-sik here though?

125
00:09:17,348 --> 00:09:20,893
Even 20 years from now,
you'll still be amazing, confident,

126
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:25,147
and be loved by everyone around you.
You'll be living as happily as ever.

127
00:09:25,231 --> 00:09:26,649
The giant squid?

128
00:09:38,995 --> 00:09:42,540
Bahn Ha-ni, the Lee Hyo-ri of Hosu High?

129
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,337
Anthony.

130
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,800
It's why one should never
meet their first love again.

131
00:09:52,883 --> 00:09:54,969
Drink this and forget about her.

132
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:12,236
-Thank you for tonight.
-Thank you, sir.

133
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:16,991
She's adorable.

134
00:10:26,959 --> 00:10:30,463
My gosh. Are we home already?

135
00:10:30,546 --> 00:10:32,632
-Why not sleep some more?
-No, I'm good.

136
00:10:34,008 --> 00:10:35,092
Gosh.

137
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:39,305
Oh, no. I bet I was a mess today.

138
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,933
Not really.
It was nice to see you have fun.

139
00:10:43,017 --> 00:10:46,062
I've known you for ten years,
but I didn't know you liked to sing.

140
00:10:49,273 --> 00:10:51,442
If it's okay with you,
let's cure that hangover.

141
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:53,819
The hangover?

142
00:10:54,403 --> 00:10:55,321
Here you go.

143
00:10:56,113 --> 00:10:56,989
Did you see that?

144
00:11:00,117 --> 00:11:01,077
Thanks.

145
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:03,287
Don't worry about being bloated tomorrow
and eat up.

146
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:05,831
Well, I'm pretty even when I'm bloated.

147
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,001
You're fun when you're drunk.

148
00:11:09,085 --> 00:11:10,586
Thank you.

149
00:11:15,091 --> 00:11:16,717
I feel so much better. It's so good.

150
00:11:17,343 --> 00:11:20,221
You and Bahn Ha-ni
are acquaintances, aren't you?

151
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:27,937
How did you know?

152
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:31,482
There was a vibe between you two.

153
00:11:31,565 --> 00:11:35,861
You seem to find her uncomfortable,
but yet I could tell you were once close.

154
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:42,326
You see,

155
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,623
we were friends in high school.

156
00:11:48,624 --> 00:11:50,918
Meaning you aren't anymore.

157
00:11:53,421 --> 00:11:56,090
We used to be the best of friends,

158
00:11:58,592 --> 00:12:03,472
but she was also the one
who made me feel inferior.

159
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:06,100
I see.

160
00:12:06,892 --> 00:12:09,645
I bet I was childish today.

161
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,771
Of course not.

162
00:12:11,397 --> 00:12:14,567
Just so you know,
you were definitely the better dancer.

163
00:12:20,531 --> 00:12:21,699
Thanks.

164
00:12:22,783 --> 00:12:27,329
Thanks for being so understanding
despite how foolish I was today.

165
00:12:27,413 --> 00:12:29,165
Foolish? As if.

166
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:33,502
You're the smartest colleague I have,

167
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:37,089
the most beautiful wife,
and the best woman there is.

168
00:12:38,174 --> 00:12:42,303
At our next team dinner, I'll make
you proud with my tambourine skills.

169
00:12:42,386 --> 00:12:43,888
How did it go again?

170
00:12:43,971 --> 00:12:45,639
Like this.

171
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,807
You were quite good.

172
00:12:47,808 --> 00:12:50,102
-Can I have some of the broth?
-No way.

173
00:12:53,272 --> 00:12:54,648
What a pretty sight, right?

174
00:12:56,025 --> 00:12:57,401
Tell me about it.

175
00:12:57,485 --> 00:13:00,029
Yu-hyeon should also find
a decent woman to marry.

176
00:13:00,821 --> 00:13:02,656
No, he needs to grow up first.

177
00:13:03,824 --> 00:13:06,911
Says the man who'll dote
on his daughter-in-law and grandchildren.

178
00:13:09,205 --> 00:13:10,122
You're right.

179
00:13:10,206 --> 00:13:13,125
I'd love to see that happen one day.

180
00:13:19,173 --> 00:13:20,424
Gosh, it's so good.

181
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:21,842
-Sure.
-Do you want some?

182
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,597
-I cooked it well, right?
-You sure did.

183
00:13:30,184 --> 00:13:33,229
How long did I walk with her on my back?

184
00:13:34,772 --> 00:13:35,648
My back hurts.

185
00:13:35,731 --> 00:13:38,943
Darling, I'm sorry
that your back is hurting.

186
00:13:39,026 --> 00:13:42,071
If I had been there,
I would've given you a massage.

187
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:43,322
What the hell?

188
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:48,327
The others will hear you
if you kiss me like that.

189
00:13:48,410 --> 00:13:49,620
You're embarrassing me.

190
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:53,916
Darling, come on. Don't be upset.

191
00:13:54,416 --> 00:13:57,336
Hey, you! Just kiss her already
and go to bed.

192
00:13:57,419 --> 00:13:59,421
Darling, just a second.

193
00:13:59,505 --> 00:14:02,341
Hey! Who are you to butt in?

194
00:14:02,424 --> 00:14:04,969
Get yourself a girlfriend too, you loser.

195
00:14:05,052 --> 00:14:07,555
What? A loser?

196
00:14:07,638 --> 00:14:10,683
You! Meet me outside.

197
00:14:10,766 --> 00:14:12,685
JOO HOUSING

198
00:14:17,106 --> 00:14:18,315
Yu-hyeon?

199
00:14:18,983 --> 00:14:21,694
Why the hell are you
coming from that room?

200
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:25,406
It took too long to commute from home,
so I moved in today.

201
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,035
You were a little too cute back there.

202
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:32,371
I think my eardrums almost melted.

203
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:36,709
Sorry about that.
From now on, to protect your hearing,

204
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:38,878
I'll stick to texting with my girlfriend.

205
00:14:39,753 --> 00:14:41,088
-Would you?
-Good night.

206
00:14:55,644 --> 00:14:56,812
Yu-hyeon?

207
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,691
-Good night.
-Sure, you too.

208
00:15:11,493 --> 00:15:13,746
He seemed to have bought the lie, ma'am.

209
00:15:13,829 --> 00:15:16,206
I'll brief you in detail soon.

210
00:15:20,002 --> 00:15:21,253
Come in.

211
00:15:26,550 --> 00:15:28,010
Chairman Han went to bed.

212
00:15:29,053 --> 00:15:30,095
I see.

213
00:15:31,138 --> 00:15:33,891
Anyway, have you considered my offer?

214
00:15:35,726 --> 00:15:38,270
Yes. I'm at your service, ma'am.

215
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,525
Those serving as
the chairman's eyes and ears

216
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:45,569
all work for me now.

217
00:15:46,695 --> 00:15:49,198
I guess it's time
we moved on to the next phase.

218
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:52,910
I'll make sure things go smoothly.

219
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:00,876
Ji-man.

220
00:16:02,836 --> 00:16:06,507
Darkness is coming your way.

221
00:16:23,899 --> 00:16:27,027
Gosh. My head's killing me.

222
00:16:27,861 --> 00:16:29,989
Don't we have any painkillers?

223
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,039
Here.

224
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:47,297
Thanks.

225
00:16:48,966 --> 00:16:51,844
Why do you drink something
that tastes foul and bitter?

226
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:59,309
It began to taste sweeter
once I grew older.

227
00:17:01,812 --> 00:17:04,273
Maybe it was because I was burned
so much in life.

228
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:06,900
So you're dating Blue Bird
to ruin the rest of your life?

229
00:17:06,984 --> 00:17:08,485
Why would I date him?

230
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:09,987
What?

231
00:17:10,070 --> 00:17:12,573
You must not remember
how he carried you home last night.

232
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,366
He did?

233
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:20,164
Did you just say that he carried me home?

234
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:24,084
I'll get that.

235
00:17:31,633 --> 00:17:32,843
What the hell?

236
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:38,682
Are you kidding me?
Why the hell are you here?

237
00:17:40,184 --> 00:17:42,644
Save it. Just give me my photo.

238
00:17:44,188 --> 00:17:45,564
What photo?

239
00:17:47,691 --> 00:17:49,234
Are you going to keep this up?

240
00:17:51,820 --> 00:17:53,989
You used your daughter to blackmail me.

241
00:17:57,409 --> 00:17:58,952
What are you talking about?

242
00:17:59,036 --> 00:18:00,829
I bet you wanted something in return.

243
00:18:04,666 --> 00:18:08,045
I don't want to talk about this anymore,
so just bring me my photo.

244
00:18:09,004 --> 00:18:10,380
I'll wait downstairs.

245
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,225
What is it?

246
00:18:24,019 --> 00:18:25,604
Did Chun-sik just give you money?

247
00:18:26,688 --> 00:18:28,065
"Yang Chun-sik"?

248
00:18:28,857 --> 00:18:30,692
I haven't seen him in 20 years.

249
00:18:30,776 --> 00:18:33,237
Didn't you know? He's Yang Chun-sik.

250
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:36,949
No way.

251
00:18:37,699 --> 00:18:39,201
Anthony is Yang Chun-sik?

252
00:18:39,284 --> 00:18:40,869
I guess you had no idea.

253
00:18:41,995 --> 00:18:45,290
But then again, it's probably because
he got tons of plastic surgery.

254
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,086
Enough about that.

255
00:18:49,169 --> 00:18:51,588
But why did he give us money?

256
00:18:51,672 --> 00:18:53,715
I don't know. Why did he give us money?

257
00:18:53,799 --> 00:18:57,261
Tell me honestly.
What photo is he talking about?

258
00:18:57,344 --> 00:18:59,138
What have you gotten yourself into?

259
00:19:04,101 --> 00:19:05,102
Long time no see.

260
00:19:05,185 --> 00:19:07,354
We saw each other earlier.
Where is my photo?

261
00:19:13,777 --> 00:19:16,488
Is this it?
Your daughter said you have tons.

262
00:19:17,531 --> 00:19:18,782
Gosh, she's unbelievable.

263
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,369
Sorry.

264
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:26,707
I'll give you the rest of the photos
as soon as I find them.

265
00:19:26,790 --> 00:19:30,210
Make sure I don't ever have to
come here again, okay?

266
00:19:30,294 --> 00:19:31,420
You can go now.

267
00:19:36,216 --> 00:19:37,301
Take this.

268
00:19:40,220 --> 00:19:41,638
I know you did it for money.

269
00:19:42,347 --> 00:19:44,725
You're raising a daughter all alone
in a rooftop house,

270
00:19:44,808 --> 00:19:47,227
so I understand how hard it can be.

271
00:19:47,311 --> 00:19:48,520
It's fine, so just take it.

272
00:19:50,981 --> 00:19:52,065
I totally get…

273
00:19:53,066 --> 00:19:55,152
why you got the wrong idea.

274
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:56,862
But…

275
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:01,658
this is just wrong.

276
00:20:04,745 --> 00:20:05,787
Hey.

277
00:20:09,541 --> 00:20:10,459
Hey.

278
00:20:11,835 --> 00:20:14,213
Take the money.
Don't come asking for it again.

279
00:20:15,005 --> 00:20:15,881
Chun-sik.

280
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,887
You're worse than before. You know that?

281
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:24,223
What?

282
00:20:24,306 --> 00:20:27,392
I get that you're rich now
after becoming famous as Anthony.

283
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:30,687
But you're no better than my pitiful self.

284
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:35,651
I'll get rid of the photos
and make sure I don't get in your way.

285
00:20:36,235 --> 00:20:37,819
Let's not see each other again.

286
00:21:00,634 --> 00:21:02,010
Where are you going?

287
00:21:03,136 --> 00:21:04,221
Why do you care?

288
00:21:10,185 --> 00:21:11,770
Give me the other photos.

289
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:13,438
I gave you everything.

290
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:16,566
Don't lie to me.

291
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,491
Hey, no. Wait.

292
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:27,411
Get off me. Let go.

293
00:21:27,494 --> 00:21:29,037
There aren't any more photos.

294
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,134
Here's one.

295
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,927
But I look good in that one.

296
00:21:44,511 --> 00:21:46,346
Quit playing around. Give me everything.

297
00:21:47,264 --> 00:21:48,682
Are there any on your phone?

298
00:21:55,147 --> 00:21:58,108
-Why won't this turn on?
-The battery's dead.

299
00:21:58,191 --> 00:22:01,236
And how can I take photos
when it doesn't have a camera?

300
00:22:03,030 --> 00:22:04,531
What's with you all of a sudden?

301
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,950
Why did you do that to Chun-sik?

302
00:22:07,034 --> 00:22:08,035
Are you insane?

303
00:22:08,118 --> 00:22:10,162
-I did it because I'm sane.
-What?

304
00:22:10,245 --> 00:22:11,747
You're living like this,

305
00:22:11,830 --> 00:22:14,416
but Chun-sik was acting like
he's a big shot.

306
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,293
So I got annoyed and pranked him.

307
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:17,502
You call that a prank?

308
00:22:21,089 --> 00:22:23,342
Okay, fine. But you know what?

309
00:22:24,092 --> 00:22:25,886
Because of that prank of yours,

310
00:22:25,969 --> 00:22:30,682
you have no idea how embarrassed I was
to face Chun-sik after 20 years.

311
00:22:51,495 --> 00:22:52,537
Yu-hyeon.

312
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:57,209
Good.
Did you look into what I asked you to?

313
00:22:57,292 --> 00:22:58,335
Well, the thing is…

314
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,547
You can't receive your payment in advance.

315
00:23:02,631 --> 00:23:06,009
Why not?
I'm an employee at Joa Confectionery.

316
00:23:06,093 --> 00:23:07,427
It's not that.

317
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:10,972
Your bank account is frozen.

318
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:12,933
What?

319
00:23:14,643 --> 00:23:16,436
Darn that old man!

320
00:23:17,938 --> 00:23:20,315
Why have the sales
for Joa Strawberry decreased?

321
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:23,860
We started using strawberries
from a different farm.

322
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,780
And because of that,
the snack must have tasted different.

323
00:23:27,364 --> 00:23:28,782
Why did you change the farm?

324
00:23:28,865 --> 00:23:33,370
There was a problem with the farm
that used to produce strawberries for us.

325
00:23:33,453 --> 00:23:35,956
So we urgently switched
to a different farm.

326
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:37,916
So you changed the raw materials?

327
00:23:38,625 --> 00:23:41,670
They made a mistake
trying to meet the launch date.

328
00:23:42,379 --> 00:23:46,800
We reduced the price
to how much it used to cost ten years ago.

329
00:23:46,883 --> 00:23:48,427
But I guess the consumers weren't happy.

330
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:51,388
If it tastes different,
the price no longer matters.

331
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:53,807
The market's already giving us
negative feedback.

332
00:23:53,890 --> 00:23:56,935
That will eventually ruin
our company reputation in the long run.

333
00:23:58,019 --> 00:24:00,439
Steady selling products
like Joa Strawberry

334
00:24:00,522 --> 00:24:03,733
have loyal customers,
so the sales will quickly jump back up.

335
00:24:03,817 --> 00:24:05,652
That's using their loyalty against them.

336
00:24:10,574 --> 00:24:11,908
First,

337
00:24:12,826 --> 00:24:16,121
I want you to meet the CEO
of the original farm

338
00:24:16,204 --> 00:24:20,959
and ask him if he can provide
organic strawberries for us again.

339
00:24:21,042 --> 00:24:22,210
Okay, sir.

340
00:24:23,295 --> 00:24:24,921
Let go of me.

341
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:28,008
-No, you can't.
-Let me in! Gosh!

342
00:24:28,091 --> 00:24:29,342
We're having a meeting.

343
00:24:29,426 --> 00:24:32,137
Dad, am I really your son?

344
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,931
-Am I adopted or something?
-What are you talking about?

345
00:24:35,015 --> 00:24:37,601
Why did you freeze my bank account?

346
00:24:37,684 --> 00:24:39,811
Why are you making my life so miserable?

347
00:24:39,895 --> 00:24:43,523
The creditor has every right
to receive money from the debtor.

348
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,401
Is there something wrong with that?

349
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:50,405
You said I won't have to pay you anything
if I work here for 100 days.

350
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,240
You still have a long way to go.

351
00:24:52,324 --> 00:24:54,701
-Damn it!
-What did you just say?

352
00:24:54,784 --> 00:24:56,620
Where are you manners?!

353
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:02,626
You're not only cheap,
but you're also immature.

354
00:25:03,126 --> 00:25:06,713
I don't even get paid that much.
Why would you take that from me?

355
00:25:06,796 --> 00:25:09,591
-Are you a loan shark or something?
-You little…

356
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:16,389
Hello, everyone.
It's time for the Joa Exercise.

357
00:25:16,473 --> 00:25:19,476
Let's all get up
and start the day with lots of energy.

358
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:21,770
I'm not done here.
What are you doing?

359
00:25:21,853 --> 00:25:23,480
It's time to exercise.

360
00:25:25,106 --> 00:25:27,025
Hey, do the exercise.

361
00:25:27,108 --> 00:25:29,236
I don't know how to do this, okay?

362
00:25:29,319 --> 00:25:31,571
Don't lie.
You loved this when you were young.

363
00:25:31,655 --> 00:25:34,407
You used to do this with Do-yun
and your grandfather.

364
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:37,953
Dance start.

365
00:25:40,121 --> 00:25:41,915
-Two.
-Why do you do this?

366
00:25:41,998 --> 00:25:44,000
You need to move your body
to use your head.

367
00:25:44,084 --> 00:25:45,877
-Four. Good job.
-You're doing great.

368
00:25:45,961 --> 00:25:47,212
Spread your arms out more.

369
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:51,550
I don't have to
since I have long arms and legs.

370
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:53,510
Okay? There! Look!

371
00:25:53,593 --> 00:25:55,595
-There you go!
-One, two, three four.

372
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:57,514
One, two. Good.

373
00:25:57,597 --> 00:25:59,516
One, two, three, four.

374
00:25:59,599 --> 00:26:01,142
One, two. Good job.

375
00:26:01,226 --> 00:26:03,895
One. Two.

376
00:26:14,531 --> 00:26:17,033
Hello. Where to, sir?

377
00:26:17,117 --> 00:26:18,285
Daejeon Hotel, please.

378
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,537
Gosh, I'm in a hurry.

379
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:22,789
What's wrong? Is there a problem?

380
00:26:22,872 --> 00:26:26,001
No, forget it. I don't have much time.
I'll just take another cab.

381
00:26:26,793 --> 00:26:28,545
Don't worry.

382
00:26:28,628 --> 00:26:31,256
If I don't get there in time,
I won't ask you to pay.

383
00:26:31,339 --> 00:26:32,674
What?

384
00:26:47,981 --> 00:26:51,943
Oh, gosh! Will you please slow down?
Please slow down!

385
00:26:52,027 --> 00:26:56,114
I won't get paid if I'm late.
I don't want that to happen.

386
00:26:58,158 --> 00:26:59,701
Ma'am!

387
00:27:05,540 --> 00:27:08,043
We've arrived at Daejeon Hotel, sir.

388
00:27:11,171 --> 00:27:13,340
You didn't need to drive so fast.

389
00:27:15,216 --> 00:27:18,720
It seemed to be important,
so I didn't want you to be in a rush.

390
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,847
Oh, right. Thank you.

391
00:27:30,273 --> 00:27:31,316
Hello?

392
00:27:32,400 --> 00:27:34,569
What? My mother-in-law did what?

393
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,699
My goodness gracious.

394
00:27:41,117 --> 00:27:42,827
-Goodness.
-Oh, gosh.

395
00:27:42,911 --> 00:27:44,746
-What happened to you?
-Never mind that.

396
00:27:44,829 --> 00:27:46,748
I can't take care of her anymore.

397
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:49,042
You can't quit all of sudden.

398
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:52,504
No, I couldn't care less.
Just find someone else.

399
00:27:52,587 --> 00:27:55,799
Ma'am, can you at least stay
until I find someone new?

400
00:27:55,882 --> 00:27:58,301
I'm sick and tired of this. My goodness.

401
00:27:58,385 --> 00:28:01,179
-I can't believe that woman.
-My goodness. Mother.

402
00:28:03,723 --> 00:28:05,016
Oh, gosh.

403
00:28:06,142 --> 00:28:08,353
-Mother.
-Hey, Ok-jeong.

404
00:28:11,147 --> 00:28:12,357
Mother.

405
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,403
We need to get going.
Hurry up and get ready.

406
00:28:17,153 --> 00:28:18,279
Where do you need to go?

407
00:28:18,863 --> 00:28:20,949
We need to go see Ha-ni.

408
00:28:21,032 --> 00:28:25,453
I bet she is desperately waiting for me.

409
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,039
Why do you suddenly want to see Ha-ni?

410
00:28:31,835 --> 00:28:35,380
I found this. I found it.

411
00:28:36,172 --> 00:28:37,048
What?

412
00:28:37,632 --> 00:28:41,177
I need to see Ha-ni and give this to her.

413
00:28:41,261 --> 00:28:42,971
This will save her.

414
00:28:45,140 --> 00:28:46,558
I'll look for a rest home.

415
00:28:46,641 --> 00:28:48,435
You've done enough, Mom.

416
00:28:49,269 --> 00:28:52,689
Let me take her to a doctor first.

417
00:28:53,690 --> 00:28:57,235
Then why don't you stay at my place
for a bit? Seong-u misses you.

418
00:28:59,320 --> 00:29:02,157
I feel like I'm burdening you.

419
00:29:03,283 --> 00:29:05,535
By the way, is Ha-ni okay?

420
00:29:06,953 --> 00:29:08,580
Why do you ask?

421
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,498
No reason.

422
00:29:11,124 --> 00:29:14,919
Your grandmother keeps mentioning her,
and it's starting to worry me.

423
00:29:15,712 --> 00:29:17,255
You should call her.

424
00:29:20,717 --> 00:29:21,885
Okay.

425
00:29:26,806 --> 00:29:28,641
BAHN HA-NI

426
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:57,754
You look just like your dad.

427
00:29:58,338 --> 00:30:00,465
Do you know my dad?

428
00:30:00,548 --> 00:30:04,594
Of course.
Chi-su and I go to the same church.

429
00:30:04,677 --> 00:30:06,429
"Chi-su"?

430
00:30:10,225 --> 00:30:11,601
I mean…

431
00:30:15,063 --> 00:30:17,941
You look just like Bald Eagle
when you're anxious.

432
00:30:18,024 --> 00:30:19,651
-What's with you?
-Come on.

433
00:30:19,734 --> 00:30:21,277
I just think you're cute.

434
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,197
We're of a similar age. Mind your manners.

435
00:30:24,864 --> 00:30:27,534
Hey, watch how you talk to me.

436
00:30:29,035 --> 00:30:31,079
-Do you want a scolding from your aunt?
-What?

437
00:30:31,704 --> 00:30:35,208
I don't think you're old enough
to be my aunt.

438
00:30:35,291 --> 00:30:39,337
Gosh, I bet you were adorable
when you were a little baby.

439
00:30:46,261 --> 00:30:47,345
I miss her.

440
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,391
I should've asked her name.

441
00:30:53,142 --> 00:30:54,644
Your name is Scarlett?

442
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:56,980
Yes.

443
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,525
But I grew up in Koreatown,
so I don't speak English.

444
00:31:00,608 --> 00:31:03,611
-So don't talk to me in English.
-Don't worry. I'm no good either.

445
00:31:05,238 --> 00:31:06,739
But, to be honest,

446
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:09,117
I didn't think you'd call me.

447
00:31:09,951 --> 00:31:13,496
I promised you to pay you back
at the burger joint.

448
00:31:14,414 --> 00:31:16,332
Thank you for keeping your promise.

449
00:31:16,416 --> 00:31:18,501
I should be thanking you.

450
00:31:18,585 --> 00:31:21,546
If it weren't for you,
I would've only had fries that day.

451
00:31:22,255 --> 00:31:26,384
Plus, I only end up feeling depressed
if I stay home all alone.

452
00:31:27,260 --> 00:31:29,262
Why? Is there something wrong?

453
00:31:30,763 --> 00:31:33,850
Well, it's too complicated to explain.

454
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:38,146
Anyway, I was going to call you
as soon as I got paid.

455
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:41,399
But it was really hard to find a payphone.

456
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:42,859
So that's why it took a while.

457
00:31:43,443 --> 00:31:46,571
Why don't you have a cell phone?
Didn't your parents get you one?

458
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:48,823
Don't even get me started.

459
00:31:48,907 --> 00:31:52,035
She makes a huge fuss about
how expensive it is.

460
00:31:52,118 --> 00:31:54,913
I'm working part-time
so I can buy one myself.

461
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:56,372
I see.

462
00:31:57,206 --> 00:32:01,127
While we're on the subject,
let's go check out some cell phones.

463
00:32:06,549 --> 00:32:09,469
Gosh, they're so pretty.

464
00:32:10,887 --> 00:32:12,138
Don't you think so?

465
00:32:15,808 --> 00:32:17,143
Where did she go?

466
00:32:17,977 --> 00:32:18,978
So-hye.

467
00:32:32,575 --> 00:32:33,493
A contest?

468
00:32:33,576 --> 00:32:34,702
JOA CONFECTIONERY
IN-HOUSE IDEA CONTEST

469
00:32:34,786 --> 00:32:35,662
-Mr. Go.
-Yes?

470
00:32:35,745 --> 00:32:37,789
Are you going to enter
the in-house contest?

471
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:40,458
I already have enough
on my plate with work.

472
00:32:40,541 --> 00:32:42,460
I know you've been planning it for a year

473
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:45,421
after you almost made it to the finals
last year.

474
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,007
I also know you've been
working hard on it yourself.

475
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:49,634
Gosh, you got me.

476
00:32:49,717 --> 00:32:53,304
Do you want to make a bet to see who wins?

477
00:32:53,388 --> 00:32:55,807
-A bet on what?
-One month's worth of lunch tickets.

478
00:32:56,391 --> 00:32:58,351
One month's worth? That's a bit too much.

479
00:32:58,893 --> 00:33:00,228
-Fine, let's do it.
-Deal?

480
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:01,771
Ms. Bang, do you want to join?

481
00:33:01,854 --> 00:33:03,523
Forget it.

482
00:33:03,606 --> 00:33:05,984
I don't get why men love making bets.

483
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:08,528
Plus, isn't it a bit unfair
for an employee

484
00:33:08,611 --> 00:33:11,406
from the Product Development Team
to enter the contest?

485
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,533
Not exactly.

486
00:33:14,117 --> 00:33:18,496
The purpose of the contest
is not only to gather lots of new ideas,

487
00:33:18,579 --> 00:33:20,999
but it's also to boost the loyalty
of our employees.

488
00:33:21,082 --> 00:33:22,959
And if you get good results,

489
00:33:23,042 --> 00:33:25,586
it'll be a chance
to be acknowledged as our team member.

490
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:28,089
I see.

491
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:30,842
What do you say?

492
00:33:31,384 --> 00:33:32,552
Ms. Bahn.

493
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:38,057
Would you also like to enter the contest?

494
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:40,435
Pardon?

495
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:42,895
I mean, who knows?

496
00:33:43,813 --> 00:33:48,151
You might get lucky once again.

497
00:33:56,492 --> 00:33:58,119
Are you sure about the bet?

498
00:33:58,202 --> 00:34:00,288
-The winner gets it all.
-Stop it already.

499
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:01,706
-Lunch tickets?
-Gosh.

500
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,499
-By the way, Mr. Go.
-Yes?

501
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:05,126
How are things with the samples?

502
00:34:05,209 --> 00:34:07,962
The samples are in the office,
so let's check right now.

503
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,465
"Samples"? Wait. By any chance,

504
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:13,676
are you talking about the snacks

505
00:34:15,344 --> 00:34:18,139
that were in the small glass bowls?

506
00:34:18,222 --> 00:34:20,349
Yes, the ones with the snacks.

507
00:34:21,476 --> 00:34:22,602
About that…

508
00:34:29,400 --> 00:34:31,527
I threw them all away
and washed the bowls.

509
00:34:32,403 --> 00:34:33,362
What?

510
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,656
We purposely left them there
to taste them.

511
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:37,992
-Why did you throw them away?
-I'm sorry.

512
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,328
I'll ask the cleaning lady.

513
00:34:40,411 --> 00:34:42,121
Forget it!

514
00:34:42,205 --> 00:34:43,331
Why would you do that?

515
00:34:43,414 --> 00:34:45,416
My gosh, this is driving me crazy.

516
00:34:54,133 --> 00:34:55,593
Aren't you embarrassed

517
00:34:55,676 --> 00:34:59,555
to work in the Product Development Team
when you don't even know the basics?

518
00:34:59,639 --> 00:35:01,140
I'm sorry.

519
00:35:01,224 --> 00:35:05,728
I'll try harder to learn more
and do my best to be better.

520
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:10,024
What's the point of giving me
all those empty promises?

521
00:35:11,776 --> 00:35:13,069
I'm sorry.

522
00:35:15,446 --> 00:35:17,115
Do you remember what you said?

523
00:35:17,657 --> 00:35:21,452
You told me that you didn't want to
embarrass yourself any longer.

524
00:35:21,536 --> 00:35:23,329
Then prove it.

525
00:35:23,871 --> 00:35:28,000
Prove that you're someone we need.

526
00:35:28,084 --> 00:35:30,461
And this time around,
don't rely on your luck.

527
00:35:30,545 --> 00:35:31,546
Show me your skill.

528
00:35:34,423 --> 00:35:35,424
Goodness.

529
00:35:41,973 --> 00:35:46,227
Someone the Product
Development Team needs?

530
00:35:57,530 --> 00:35:59,365
Half the original price?

531
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:01,993
I rushed over here in a cab
during my break time

532
00:36:02,076 --> 00:36:04,120
because I heard you guys paid a lot.

533
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:07,874
That's just how the pricing is
for secondhand goods.

534
00:36:07,957 --> 00:36:10,001
I know that,

535
00:36:10,084 --> 00:36:12,587
but I only wore this once.

536
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:15,673
It's a limited edition,
and there are only two in this country.

537
00:36:15,756 --> 00:36:20,052
We actually got hold of the other one,
so yours isn't as valuable.

538
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,929
Seriously?

539
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:25,892
Shouldn't you give me a premium
since I wore it?

540
00:36:25,975 --> 00:36:29,187
-Shouldn't you?
-I'm sorry, but we can't do that.

541
00:36:29,270 --> 00:36:30,897
I'm so speechless…

542
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,695
You're selling that
after what you've said?

543
00:36:37,778 --> 00:36:40,114
Don't be ridiculous.

544
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:42,700
I just came to ask about its market price.

545
00:36:42,783 --> 00:36:44,660
If you're humiliated right now,

546
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,704
you should sell it and run away.

547
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:51,250
You really don't know who I am, do you?

548
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,753
Since I can't do it myself, tell him.

549
00:36:55,755 --> 00:36:56,797
Tell him what?

550
00:36:58,591 --> 00:37:01,594
Tell him who I am.

551
00:37:02,637 --> 00:37:03,804
I'm not following…

552
00:37:05,681 --> 00:37:09,769
Forget it. No matter how much you beg,
I'm not selling this.

553
00:37:09,852 --> 00:37:10,853
Never.

554
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,398
I pushed back my entire schedule today,
you know?

555
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:17,860
-What's next on my schedule?
-Nothing.

556
00:37:19,528 --> 00:37:20,696
Start the car.

557
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,615
Goodbye.

558
00:37:35,211 --> 00:37:36,420
I'm not selling either!

559
00:37:43,719 --> 00:37:44,971
Come on!

560
00:37:49,558 --> 00:37:52,561
By the way, what's your relationship
with Bahn Ha-ni?

561
00:37:52,645 --> 00:37:54,188
I doubt you're her husband.

562
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,315
What's it to you?

563
00:37:56,399 --> 00:38:00,403
Forget it. Judging by how vain you are
despite being poor,

564
00:38:00,486 --> 00:38:03,823
you and Ha-ni must both be lousy.

565
00:38:03,906 --> 00:38:05,533
"Lousy"?

566
00:38:06,659 --> 00:38:10,204
You must not know
what kind of person she is.

567
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:14,625
I know her a lot better than you do.

568
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,169
As if. In that case,
you wouldn't have said that.

569
00:38:17,253 --> 00:38:20,256
She's in no position to be called that
by people like you. She's…

570
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:23,676
an awesome woman!

571
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:31,142
"An awesome woman"?
What do you know about her?

572
00:38:31,726 --> 00:38:33,644
We even smooched…

573
00:38:41,652 --> 00:38:43,029
Darn it!

574
00:38:43,779 --> 00:38:45,156
We kissed!

575
00:38:46,282 --> 00:38:48,409
"Kissed"?

576
00:39:08,721 --> 00:39:09,847
Are you okay?

577
00:39:21,650 --> 00:39:22,818
No!

578
00:39:30,993 --> 00:39:32,203
That little…

579
00:39:39,960 --> 00:39:42,838
Why am I imagining something
so ludicrous and obnoxious?

580
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:49,053
That little…

581
00:39:49,136 --> 00:39:52,264
JOA STRAWBERRY

582
00:40:07,029 --> 00:40:08,489
They have the same strawberry taste.

583
00:40:10,741 --> 00:40:11,784
So you're saying

584
00:40:12,493 --> 00:40:17,164
that these two taste exactly the same?

585
00:40:21,627 --> 00:40:22,461
I'm sorry.

586
00:40:23,838 --> 00:40:26,841
I only said so because it did.

587
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:29,677
But if you were to ask me why…

588
00:40:32,513 --> 00:40:36,559
Forget it. You're still struggling
with your given tasks.

589
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:38,519
I doubt you could carry out a taste test.

590
00:40:39,603 --> 00:40:40,813
I'm sorry.

591
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,567
It lacks that natural sweetness.

592
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,819
And the roof of my mouth.

593
00:40:47,528 --> 00:40:51,115
This one doesn't melt as much
at the roof of my mouth.

594
00:40:51,198 --> 00:40:54,160
Gosh, Yong-hwa. You're really a gem.

595
00:40:56,662 --> 00:40:59,999
To maintain his palate, he doesn't drink,
smoke, or even drink coffee.

596
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:01,834
He's so fussy.

597
00:41:01,917 --> 00:41:03,002
Because of my palate,

598
00:41:03,085 --> 00:41:08,007
I know exactly what my girlfriend ate
before kissing me.

599
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:10,801
Gosh! Are you a pervert?

600
00:41:10,885 --> 00:41:12,887
I'm not interested in your dating life.

601
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:15,264
Stop fighting, you two!

602
00:41:15,347 --> 00:41:19,351
First, we've confirmed that these two
don't taste the same.

603
00:41:19,435 --> 00:41:21,353
Let's call it a day for today.

604
00:41:21,437 --> 00:41:24,648
Tomorrow, let's go to the farm together.

605
00:41:24,732 --> 00:41:25,816
-Okay.
-Good work.

606
00:41:25,900 --> 00:41:28,110
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

607
00:41:37,244 --> 00:41:40,164
Did something bad happen?

608
00:41:40,247 --> 00:41:41,290
No.

609
00:41:41,916 --> 00:41:43,709
I went somewhere for some money

610
00:41:44,418 --> 00:41:46,045
and ended up ruining my day.

611
00:41:46,128 --> 00:41:50,174
-Why do you need money?
-Bus, food, coffee, phone bills…

612
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:51,383
Everything requires money.

613
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,386
I can't believe I became dirt-poor.

614
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:59,642
Money is always a problem
whether you have it or not.

615
00:41:59,725 --> 00:42:01,769
We can't help but worry about the future.

616
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:05,189
We'll worry about money
until the day we die.

617
00:42:05,272 --> 00:42:08,067
Tell me about it.
I wish it fell from the sky.

618
00:42:10,027 --> 00:42:12,238
Hey, they're holding a contest
this year as well.

619
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,365
Goodness, time flies.

620
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:18,035
Last year, the first prize was
five million won.

621
00:42:18,118 --> 00:42:21,288
Yes. But it's ten million won this year.

622
00:42:21,372 --> 00:42:22,289
How much?

623
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:29,755
Someone the Product
Development Team needs.

624
00:42:30,631 --> 00:42:32,633
2020 JOA CONFECTIONERY
IN-HOUSE IDEA CONTEST

625
00:42:39,431 --> 00:42:40,516
Ten million won.

626
00:42:42,226 --> 00:42:43,435
Hello.

627
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,229
Hello… No, wait.

628
00:42:45,312 --> 00:42:46,939
Shouldn't you thank me first?

629
00:42:47,022 --> 00:42:50,484
I have so many pain-relief patches
on my back thanks to you.

630
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:53,195
I heard what happened this morning.

631
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,364
I'm sorry.

632
00:42:56,156 --> 00:42:57,741
And thank you.

633
00:42:57,825 --> 00:43:00,828
Then why don't you treat me to a meal?

634
00:43:00,911 --> 00:43:02,413
I have a few questions to ask.

635
00:43:02,496 --> 00:43:06,542
I'm afraid I have to go home right away.

636
00:43:06,625 --> 00:43:08,127
You always act so busy.

637
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:11,964
By the way, are you interested
in participating?

638
00:43:12,047 --> 00:43:13,549
Not at all.

639
00:43:14,216 --> 00:43:17,636
I'm still new here,
so I don't know much anyway.

640
00:43:18,387 --> 00:43:20,681
What? Yu-hyeon.

641
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,350
-Are you participating?
-Yes.

642
00:43:24,184 --> 00:43:26,604
What is it?
Do you think I'm not qualified?

643
00:43:31,525 --> 00:43:33,527
NATIONAL TECHNICAL
QUALIFICATION CERTIFICATE

644
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:35,738
Korean, Western, Chinese,
Japanese cuisines,

645
00:43:35,821 --> 00:43:39,658
baking, blowfish,
and barista certificates. See?

646
00:43:41,243 --> 00:43:43,912
What do you think?
I'm qualified, aren't I?

647
00:43:44,872 --> 00:43:47,833
So that's how you made that tteokbokki.

648
00:43:49,501 --> 00:43:51,337
Do you want to join me?

649
00:43:51,420 --> 00:43:53,922
No. I'm not ready yet.

650
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:57,384
Oh well, then.

651
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:03,891
Should I ask Seung-seok
and the Ja sisters to join me?

652
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:16,236
I guess she stayed home all day
like a good girl.

653
00:44:18,197 --> 00:44:19,198
I'm…

654
00:44:25,329 --> 00:44:26,330
What are you doing?

655
00:44:28,415 --> 00:44:31,168
I'm desperately praying for rain.

656
00:44:31,251 --> 00:44:32,628
Rain?

657
00:44:32,711 --> 00:44:35,547
It will have to rain for me to go home.

658
00:44:35,631 --> 00:44:37,633
Then we won't have to
see each other anymore.

659
00:44:43,472 --> 00:44:44,306
Move aside.

660
00:44:46,684 --> 00:44:48,060
What are you doing?

661
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:50,312
Two is better than one.

662
00:44:51,897 --> 00:44:54,650
Right. I'm sure you want me gone
as soon as possible.

663
00:44:57,027 --> 00:44:58,654
That's not true.

664
00:45:02,282 --> 00:45:04,743
It's true that
you are one terrible troublemaker,

665
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:08,372
but there were times I was happier
thanks to you.

666
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:11,917
What's gotten into you?

667
00:45:13,919 --> 00:45:16,922
I mean, think about it.

668
00:45:17,673 --> 00:45:20,175
All the trouble you caused

669
00:45:20,259 --> 00:45:22,052
was due to my shortcomings.

670
00:45:23,971 --> 00:45:28,392
Like you said, I'm living a pitiful life.

671
00:45:29,476 --> 00:45:32,813
There you go again.
I told you to be confident.

672
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:39,027
But you've been doing slightly better.

673
00:45:40,320 --> 00:45:43,657
So always be confident
and cheer up even more.

674
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,075
Like your old self.

675
00:45:47,494 --> 00:45:49,872
Thanks, Ha-ni.

676
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,666
Don't be so corny.

677
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:54,168
Hurry up and pray.

678
00:46:21,737 --> 00:46:23,822
Forget about the strawberries.

679
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,700
They're going to grow something else.
What should we do?

680
00:46:27,242 --> 00:46:30,120
I think they're quite upset

681
00:46:30,204 --> 00:46:33,081
because we were the ones
who broke the contract.

682
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,001
Shouldn't we look for another farm?

683
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:39,505
There aren't many all-organic farms
and the production cost is high.

684
00:46:39,588 --> 00:46:43,050
That's why we never really considered
switching farms.

685
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,720
Then what now? They're no longer going
to grow strawberries.

686
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:51,767
Let's try to convince the owners.

687
00:46:54,812 --> 00:46:55,854
We're truly sorry.

688
00:46:57,773 --> 00:47:01,109
We had to change vendors against our will

689
00:47:01,735 --> 00:47:04,947
due to our product renewal schedule.

690
00:47:05,030 --> 00:47:06,824
We sincerely apologize.

691
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:08,742
What's done cannot be undone.

692
00:47:08,826 --> 00:47:11,620
What's the point of apologizing now?

693
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:15,123
We've been working with your company
for the past decade.

694
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:18,877
So how could you betray us like this?

695
00:47:18,961 --> 00:47:20,504
We're truly sorry.

696
00:47:21,588 --> 00:47:25,425
We'll come up with a preventative measure

697
00:47:25,509 --> 00:47:28,804
to make sure this never happens again.

698
00:47:28,887 --> 00:47:31,014
"A preventative measure"?

699
00:47:31,098 --> 00:47:32,683
How can we trust you?

700
00:47:32,766 --> 00:47:35,602
You guys are the ones who broke
our trust after ten years!

701
00:47:36,228 --> 00:47:39,398
We're no longer going
to grow strawberries.

702
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:43,652
We were able to offer quality products
to our customers because--

703
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:46,321
I don't want to hear it.
We're leaving. Let's go.

704
00:47:46,405 --> 00:47:49,032
-Let's go.
-Let's go.

705
00:47:49,116 --> 00:47:51,076
-Wait.
-Please wait.

706
00:47:51,159 --> 00:47:52,619
What should I do?

707
00:48:16,894 --> 00:48:18,979
Hey, old lady. What a surprise.

708
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:21,148
Yu-hyeon, you said

709
00:48:21,732 --> 00:48:23,734
you could cook anything, right?

710
00:48:23,817 --> 00:48:26,153
I showed you my certificates yesterday.

711
00:48:26,236 --> 00:48:29,615
Then could you tell me some recipes

712
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,200
that use strawberries?

713
00:48:32,951 --> 00:48:33,952
Strawberries?

714
00:48:41,585 --> 00:48:42,628
Gosh.

715
00:48:42,711 --> 00:48:45,505
Is there really no way to convince them?

716
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:47,883
They seem very upset.

717
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:50,844
They are even refusing to hear us out.

718
00:48:52,888 --> 00:48:56,808
First, let's go back to the company
and think of a solution.

719
00:48:56,892 --> 00:49:00,479
Gosh, why isn't Ms. Bahn picking up?

720
00:49:00,562 --> 00:49:02,105
Where could she be?

721
00:49:02,189 --> 00:49:03,774
Unbelievable.

722
00:49:03,857 --> 00:49:06,485
They say that people
don't change that easily.

723
00:49:06,568 --> 00:49:09,154
-I'm sick of her.
-Let's go look for her.

724
00:49:09,237 --> 00:49:10,864
-Okay.
-Gosh, my legs.

725
00:49:11,365 --> 00:49:13,116
-Gosh.
-Goodness.

726
00:49:16,495 --> 00:49:19,623
What did you want to show us
to call us back here again?

727
00:49:20,374 --> 00:49:21,208
Sorry?

728
00:49:21,291 --> 00:49:23,835
One of your workers asked us
to spare an hour.

729
00:49:26,004 --> 00:49:28,465
Ms. Bahn, where have you…

730
00:49:28,548 --> 00:49:30,425
What is that?

731
00:49:37,265 --> 00:49:40,102
By the way, what are you planning?

732
00:49:40,185 --> 00:49:41,186
What do you mean?

733
00:49:41,269 --> 00:49:44,648
I'm talking about Yu-hyeon. How long
will you lock him up in the kitchen?

734
00:49:44,731 --> 00:49:46,274
I didn't lock him up.

735
00:49:46,358 --> 00:49:48,777
He volunteered to work there for 100 days.

736
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:51,196
But still, if you want him
to take over this place,

737
00:49:51,279 --> 00:49:53,573
he should work for the right department.

738
00:49:54,074 --> 00:49:56,118
Why should I? He's uninterested.

739
00:49:56,201 --> 00:49:58,578
He's neither competent nor ready
to take on that role.

740
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:00,414
Then what will you do?

741
00:50:00,497 --> 00:50:03,792
You're not getting any younger, you know?

742
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:06,628
What's wrong with my age?

743
00:50:06,712 --> 00:50:08,088
I'm still as fit as a fiddle.

744
00:50:08,171 --> 00:50:11,216
Don't you know you should never brag
about being healthy?

745
00:50:11,299 --> 00:50:13,927
By the way, how's the preparation
for the contest going?

746
00:50:15,262 --> 00:50:18,223
Great. After all, Do-yun's overseeing it.

747
00:50:18,306 --> 00:50:21,810
Are you bragging about your son?

748
00:50:22,728 --> 00:50:25,939
That is right. I am bragging about my son.

749
00:50:38,952 --> 00:50:40,328
What's going on?

750
00:50:40,412 --> 00:50:41,288
What? What is it?

751
00:50:42,247 --> 00:50:44,374
-Where is my sofa?
-Right.

752
00:50:45,459 --> 00:50:46,460
Well…

753
00:50:47,919 --> 00:50:50,130
Joa Confectionery In-house Contest.

754
00:50:50,213 --> 00:50:52,549
We've been holding this contest
for over 30 years.

755
00:50:52,632 --> 00:50:56,511
Most of our steady-sellers
were prize-winning products.

756
00:50:56,595 --> 00:50:59,306
Not only will the winner receive
ten million won,

757
00:50:59,389 --> 00:51:03,226
but their product will be released
and receive a portion of the sales.

758
00:51:03,310 --> 00:51:05,520
It is an important event
that the employees

759
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:07,522
look forward to all year.

760
00:51:07,606 --> 00:51:11,777
And who is the star
of this important event this year?

761
00:51:11,860 --> 00:51:14,112
It is you.

762
00:51:14,196 --> 00:51:15,489
That's right!

763
00:51:16,323 --> 00:51:18,450
Our mission is to win the prize money

764
00:51:18,533 --> 00:51:20,952
and to get revenge
on that heinous loan shark.

765
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:22,621
Let's overthrow Chairman Han!

766
00:51:22,704 --> 00:51:24,915
-That little…
-Let's overthrow Chairman…

767
00:51:26,041 --> 00:51:27,876
Seung-seok, I really like you.

768
00:51:27,959 --> 00:51:30,504
You and I are a team.

769
00:51:30,587 --> 00:51:32,506
Our team's name will be "Hanwoo Galbi."

770
00:51:32,589 --> 00:51:34,299
"Hanwoo Galbi"?

771
00:51:34,382 --> 00:51:36,093
"H" for "Han Ji-man."

772
00:51:36,176 --> 00:51:38,011
"W for "the worst human in the world."

773
00:51:38,095 --> 00:51:40,680
"G" for "getting worse every day."

774
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:44,601
"B" for "belligerent geezer,
I'll teach you a lesson!"

775
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,021
But I have no desire to--

776
00:51:48,105 --> 00:51:49,022
Hanwoo.

777
00:51:50,190 --> 00:51:51,316
Galbi.

778
00:51:51,399 --> 00:51:52,859
-Hanwoo!
-Galbi!

779
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:54,194
-Hanwoo!
-Galbi!

780
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,071
-Hanwoo!
-Galbi!

781
00:52:01,701 --> 00:52:04,621
What are you trying to do with this?

782
00:52:04,704 --> 00:52:05,747
Try them.

783
00:52:06,665 --> 00:52:10,127
We made them with the strawberries
that could be the last batch

784
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,003
grown at the farm.

785
00:52:13,338 --> 00:52:14,589
You too.

786
00:52:15,257 --> 00:52:16,216
-Okay.
-Okay.

787
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:17,884
Try them.

788
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:38,864
This is my first time making anything
with strawberries.

789
00:52:40,073 --> 00:52:41,783
But isn't it strange?

790
00:52:42,367 --> 00:52:44,995
They're tasty when grilled, fried,

791
00:52:45,954 --> 00:52:47,998
made into a salad, or ground.

792
00:52:48,081 --> 00:52:49,583
They are all tasty.

793
00:52:50,584 --> 00:52:52,294
It's all because of these strawberries.

794
00:52:55,130 --> 00:52:58,508
Thanks to all your hard work
growing these strawberries,

795
00:52:58,592 --> 00:53:02,596
Joa Strawberry was
all the more tasty and unique.

796
00:53:03,889 --> 00:53:07,100
However, if you give up on growing them,

797
00:53:08,018 --> 00:53:11,563
we will no longer be able
to taste this again.

798
00:53:16,484 --> 00:53:18,028
It breaks our hearts to do so,

799
00:53:18,653 --> 00:53:22,157
and no one else wants to grow them

800
00:53:22,782 --> 00:53:24,117
as much as we do.

801
00:53:24,201 --> 00:53:26,494
Ms. Oh, did you hear that?

802
00:53:26,578 --> 00:53:30,165
They don't really want to give up.

803
00:53:30,957 --> 00:53:33,919
Perhaps they're more desperate
than we are.

804
00:53:40,634 --> 00:53:41,635
Sir.

805
00:53:43,094 --> 00:53:47,098
Does this mean you're willing
to give us another chance?

806
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:51,228
Go tell your company that we're still in.

807
00:54:10,121 --> 00:54:11,248
It's so cramped in here.

808
00:54:11,331 --> 00:54:13,458
-Go over there.
-Move your dirty butt.

809
00:54:13,541 --> 00:54:14,876
What? "Dirty butt"?

810
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:17,003
-I ought to--
-Be quiet.

811
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,046
Goodness.

812
00:54:41,403 --> 00:54:46,449
I would like to ask the chairman
and the rest of you

813
00:54:46,533 --> 00:54:49,327
for a difficult favor.

814
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,622
The ingredients used
for Joa Strawberry changed

815
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,000
during the renewal process.

816
00:54:55,083 --> 00:54:59,337
I'm sure you all know that the taste
has changed slightly.

817
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:27,115
"Attempting to do something impossible
is foolish."

818
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:32,996
I think it's right for us
to compensate them

819
00:55:33,079 --> 00:55:35,290
regarding the violation of the contract,

820
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:38,626
and purchase the strawberries

821
00:55:38,710 --> 00:55:41,921
according to their desired price.

822
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:46,468
Must we go so far as to suffer a loss?

823
00:55:47,844 --> 00:55:51,765
I understand what you're getting at,
but this isn't a charity.

824
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,225
The stockholders will oppose--

825
00:55:54,309 --> 00:55:55,143
Why don't we…

826
00:55:56,561 --> 00:55:58,772
hear her out first?

827
00:56:01,775 --> 00:56:03,401
I believe

828
00:56:04,152 --> 00:56:07,155
this is an essential step for us to take

829
00:56:08,281 --> 00:56:10,158
in building a responsible company.

830
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:16,748
We've always strived to offer
tasty and healthy snacks to our customers.

831
00:56:16,831 --> 00:56:20,293
We've been following that principle
for the last 60 years.

832
00:56:20,877 --> 00:56:24,130
We should admit to our shortcomings,

833
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,425
and motivate, not only the customers,
but also the manufacturers.

834
00:56:27,509 --> 00:56:30,011
Following our old principle

835
00:56:30,095 --> 00:56:32,722
is how we can repay our customers

836
00:56:32,806 --> 00:56:34,891
who love and purchase our snacks.

837
00:56:35,767 --> 00:56:38,561
I believe it will pave the way
for a better future

838
00:56:39,396 --> 00:56:42,065
and help us grow as a company.

839
00:57:02,210 --> 00:57:03,169
Ms. Oh.

840
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,683
-We did it!
-Yes!

841
00:57:20,979 --> 00:57:24,149
-We did it!
-Thank you!

842
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:27,986
-I can't believe this!
-We did it!

843
00:57:30,238 --> 00:57:33,825
Ms. Bahn, may I have a word with you?

844
00:57:43,168 --> 00:57:44,377
Thanks.

845
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,797
We got through this thanks to you.

846
00:57:48,756 --> 00:57:49,841
It was nothing.

847
00:57:50,717 --> 00:57:55,680
I just didn't want
those tasty strawberries to disappear.

848
00:57:55,763 --> 00:57:58,057
In any case,
you do deserve the compliment.

849
00:58:00,018 --> 00:58:01,936
That doesn't mean I've acknowledged you.

850
00:58:03,229 --> 00:58:04,105
Okay.

851
00:58:05,023 --> 00:58:06,024
Anyway…

852
00:58:07,442 --> 00:58:09,068
it was cold out today.

853
00:58:11,029 --> 00:58:12,614
Thank you for your hard work.

854
00:58:55,031 --> 00:58:56,991
ATTEMPTING TO DO SOMETHING IMPOSSIBLE
IS FOOLISH

855
00:58:59,494 --> 00:59:01,829
You've been doing slightly better.

856
00:59:01,913 --> 00:59:04,666
So always be confident
and cheer up even more.

857
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:06,376
Like your old self.

858
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:17,512
Hey, old lady!

859
00:59:18,304 --> 00:59:20,682
Did you use the recipes I sent you?

860
00:59:20,765 --> 00:59:21,641
Yu-hyeon.

861
00:59:23,184 --> 00:59:24,310
Thank you.

862
00:59:25,103 --> 00:59:27,981
I've never revealed those recipes
to anyone before.

863
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:31,317
I'll really treat you to a meal this time.

864
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,027
-I'll call you later.
-Okay.

865
00:59:44,706 --> 00:59:46,958
Let's call it a day.

866
00:59:47,041 --> 00:59:49,419
Thank you for running around
in the cold today.

867
00:59:49,502 --> 00:59:50,712
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

868
00:59:55,717 --> 00:59:56,718
Ms. Oh.

869
00:59:59,470 --> 01:00:00,388
Yes?

870
01:00:01,389 --> 01:00:03,975
I want to do it.

871
01:00:04,726 --> 01:00:05,560
Do what?

872
01:00:05,643 --> 01:00:07,812
You told me

873
01:00:07,895 --> 01:00:11,107
to prove to you that I'm someone

874
01:00:11,774 --> 01:00:13,192
this team needs.

875
01:00:13,776 --> 01:00:14,611
So?

876
01:00:14,694 --> 01:00:16,404
I'd like to compete

877
01:00:18,072 --> 01:00:19,407
in the contest.

878
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,875
Let's do it together.

879
01:01:10,958 --> 01:01:11,876
The contest?

880
01:01:11,959 --> 01:01:13,670
Is there anything else?

881
01:01:13,753 --> 01:01:16,964
What's your relationship
with that Anthony guy?

882
01:01:17,048 --> 01:01:19,550
-Bahn Ha-ni?
-Did she send this?

883
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:21,344
I don't think this will do.

884
01:01:21,427 --> 01:01:22,887
Do you have any other ideas?

885
01:01:22,970 --> 01:01:25,056
I want to hurry back and see Dad.

886
01:01:25,139 --> 01:01:28,976
Once I'm done here,
I'll make your life easier.

887
01:01:29,060 --> 01:01:31,729
She's not going to steal anything,
you morons!

888
01:01:32,730 --> 01:01:35,024
