00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,345
EPISODE 15

2
00:01:04,397 --> 00:01:05,732
Honey.

3
00:01:10,111 --> 00:01:11,237
I'm here.

4
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:13,490
Have you been well?

5
00:01:23,458 --> 00:01:24,834
Dad?

6
00:01:26,878 --> 00:01:30,340
Ha-ni. How did you get here?

7
00:01:33,635 --> 00:01:35,970
It's dangerous to be roaming outside
like this.

8
00:01:36,054 --> 00:01:37,472
Let's go home. Hurry.

9
00:01:37,555 --> 00:01:39,057
-Wait.
-Come here right now!

10
00:01:44,562 --> 00:01:46,981
WE LOVE YOU, DAD!

11
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:51,903
Dad?

12
00:01:55,573 --> 00:01:57,450
Why are you here?

13
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,077
Why?

14
00:02:01,037 --> 00:02:04,082
BAHN GI-TAE

15
00:02:10,255 --> 00:02:11,381
Ha-ni, watch out!

16
00:02:14,926 --> 00:02:16,094
Ha-ni!

17
00:02:23,434 --> 00:02:24,435
Was it that day?

18
00:02:29,566 --> 00:02:32,068
Is that when Dad…

19
00:02:35,530 --> 00:02:36,948
Let me explain everything.

20
00:02:37,031 --> 00:02:39,159
I'll tell you what happened,
so let's go home.

21
00:02:39,242 --> 00:02:42,036
No! This can't be true!

22
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:44,747
Ha-ni…

23
00:02:50,295 --> 00:02:51,671
Because of me…

24
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:55,717
This was all my fault.

25
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,303
-No.
-I did this to Dad.

26
00:02:58,386 --> 00:03:00,763
No, it wasn't your fault.

27
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:04,976
It wasn't your fault.
You're not to blame at all.

28
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:10,148
You aren't to blame, so don't think that.

29
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:14,527
No, it was my fault. I did this.

30
00:03:31,377 --> 00:03:33,504
JOA CONFECTIONERY
SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

31
00:03:39,636 --> 00:03:41,429
Hey, Mom. What--

32
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:45,141
Can you slow down? I didn't hear you.

33
00:03:47,018 --> 00:03:48,186
What did you just say?

34
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,479
Why was she there?

35
00:04:01,366 --> 00:04:02,742
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAN JI-SUK

36
00:04:25,098 --> 00:04:26,099
Dad,

37
00:04:26,599 --> 00:04:29,435
don't worry too much. I'm sure we'll win.

38
00:04:31,562 --> 00:04:33,231
What I'm worried about

39
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,025
isn't the result of the meeting.

40
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:42,865
Once this is all over,
someone will end up hurt.

41
00:04:44,742 --> 00:04:46,035
That's…

42
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:49,205
what pains me the most.

43
00:04:57,588 --> 00:04:58,798
The result is out, sir.

44
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:06,222
JOA CONFECTIONERY
SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

45
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:20,236
We thank our shareholders for making time

46
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,529
to attend today's meeting.

47
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:26,034
I will now announce the voting result.

48
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,663
The shareholders have voted regarding

49
00:05:31,581 --> 00:05:34,250
the dismissal
of Joa Confectionery's chairman.

50
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,881
What do you think happened?

51
00:05:39,964 --> 00:05:42,050
Did we win or lose?

52
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,844
The wait is killing me!

53
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:47,930
Let's stay patient for a while longer.

54
00:05:51,267 --> 00:05:52,852
Over there. He's back!

55
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:54,479
-Hey.
-He's back.

56
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:56,439
How did it go?

57
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,946
We won!

58
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,202
Thank you!

59
00:06:12,872 --> 00:06:14,040
Good job, guys.

60
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:18,294
Wait. Old lady…

61
00:06:18,377 --> 00:06:20,505
I mean, did Ms. Bahn go somewhere?

62
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:23,591
She left after receiving a call.

63
00:06:23,674 --> 00:06:24,759
Is that so?

64
00:06:26,969 --> 00:06:29,138
-We did it.
-Nicely done.

65
00:06:29,222 --> 00:06:31,265
-Give me a hug.
-Sure thing.

66
00:06:31,349 --> 00:06:33,309
-Good job, guys.
-Good job.

67
00:06:36,312 --> 00:06:38,981
The person you have dialed cannot…

68
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,609
Where did she go?

69
00:07:04,132 --> 00:07:05,466
This isn't the end.

70
00:07:06,592 --> 00:07:09,762
I won't go down without a fight.

71
00:07:10,429 --> 00:07:13,099
Joa Confectionery
should've been mine from the start!

72
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:16,602
Mother, that's enough.

73
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:20,898
What did you even do?
You told me not to worry.

74
00:07:21,607 --> 00:07:23,609
You said that you'd make sure we win,

75
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,403
so what just happened?

76
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:29,532
Ms. Han Ji-suk.

77
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,829
Who are you people?

78
00:07:38,416 --> 00:07:41,461
You are under arrest
for stock price manipulation

79
00:07:41,544 --> 00:07:43,379
and violating the Food Sanitation Act.

80
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,423
What? What…

81
00:07:46,174 --> 00:07:47,592
What are you saying?

82
00:07:47,675 --> 00:07:49,802
Do you have proof? Show me.

83
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:52,305
Arrest her.

84
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:55,349
Let go!

85
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:59,145
Do-yun, call my lawyer immediately.

86
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:12,325
You…

87
00:08:13,284 --> 00:08:14,202
Come with us.

88
00:08:24,712 --> 00:08:26,005
Aunt?

89
00:08:36,224 --> 00:08:37,975
Dad, what's going on?

90
00:08:39,477 --> 00:08:40,770
Do-yun.

91
00:08:41,896 --> 00:08:42,730
Are you all right?

92
00:08:45,399 --> 00:08:46,317
Do-yun?

93
00:08:51,197 --> 00:08:52,323
I'm sorry…

94
00:08:53,491 --> 00:08:55,409
for bringing you so much pain.

95
00:08:58,079 --> 00:08:59,247
It's okay, Uncle.

96
00:09:00,331 --> 00:09:01,874
This was the only way

97
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,710
to stop her.

98
00:09:06,587 --> 00:09:09,715
It was the only way
to stop her from turning into a monster.

99
00:09:10,216 --> 00:09:12,510
But you got hurt in the process.

100
00:09:14,345 --> 00:09:15,388
Do-yun…

101
00:09:15,972 --> 00:09:18,140
your heart was broken instead.

102
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,439
You should go after her.

103
00:09:26,691 --> 00:09:27,567
Sure.

104
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:31,070
We'll talk later.

105
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:13,821
Ha-ni.

106
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:17,116
Mom.

107
00:10:21,495 --> 00:10:22,872
She won't budge.

108
00:10:24,540 --> 00:10:25,583
She says…

109
00:10:26,667 --> 00:10:28,836
she wants to stay with your dad.

110
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:41,140
Get up.

111
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,184
We should go.

112
00:10:44,185 --> 00:10:45,936
It's dangerous to be outside.

113
00:10:46,812 --> 00:10:48,272
Let's hurry home.

114
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:51,067
I'm going to go back.

115
00:10:52,860 --> 00:10:56,864
I'm going to go back and save our dad.

116
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,618
I will save him no matter what.

117
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:12,004
This wouldn't have happened to him
had I not gone to that audition.

118
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,424
This is all my fault.

119
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,346
I'm the one who did this to Dad.

120
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:24,892
No. I told you it's not your fault.

121
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:26,894
Stand up, Ha-ni.

122
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:30,398
Don't you dare think that.

123
00:11:30,898 --> 00:11:32,483
Your dad died protecting you

124
00:11:32,566 --> 00:11:34,527
because you meant more to him
than his life.

125
00:11:34,610 --> 00:11:36,070
WE LOVE YOU, DAD!

126
00:11:40,825 --> 00:11:41,700
Mom…

127
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,537
If it ever happens again,

128
00:11:46,414 --> 00:11:49,667
I will do exactly what your father did.

129
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,796
It's not your fault.

130
00:11:55,005 --> 00:11:56,257
Never.

131
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,592
You're not to blame.

132
00:12:05,182 --> 00:12:07,476
It's not your fault.

133
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,869
I'm so sorry.

134
00:12:25,828 --> 00:12:31,292
I'm sorry for not telling you this
20 years ago.

135
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:36,547
I'm so sorry it took me so long

136
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:39,717
to take you in my arms.

137
00:12:44,889 --> 00:12:46,098
I'm sorry.

138
00:13:01,655 --> 00:13:02,823
Do-yun.

139
00:13:06,410 --> 00:13:07,912
What happened?

140
00:13:08,412 --> 00:13:09,788
I heard Mother was arrested.

141
00:13:15,377 --> 00:13:16,378
Just…

142
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:21,550
let me stay this way for a little while.

143
00:13:28,265 --> 00:13:30,351
It's been hard for you, hasn't it?

144
00:13:31,477 --> 00:13:35,814
I'm sorry for making you think
you were all alone.

145
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:40,903
It's over now though.

146
00:13:43,447 --> 00:13:44,490
But…

147
00:13:45,908 --> 00:13:46,742
your mother…

148
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:52,456
It was the only way to save my mom

149
00:13:52,540 --> 00:13:53,457
and also you.

150
00:13:55,167 --> 00:13:56,168
Do-yun.

151
00:13:57,211 --> 00:14:00,548
The loneliness that built up inside her
throughout the years

152
00:14:01,382 --> 00:14:02,883
made her this way,

153
00:14:04,218 --> 00:14:06,387
so I'll have to be a better son.

154
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,558
You must be heartbroken though.

155
00:14:11,892 --> 00:14:12,977
But…

156
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:16,146
don't endure all the agony
on your own anymore.

157
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,108
Tell me everything.

158
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,193
I'll do better.

159
00:14:22,403 --> 00:14:24,488
Right. Thank you for saying that.

160
00:14:25,823 --> 00:14:29,243
It's because of you
that I was able to return to my place.

161
00:14:30,744 --> 00:14:31,954
I want to thank you too…

162
00:14:32,955 --> 00:14:36,125
for coming back to me and our child.

163
00:14:52,099 --> 00:14:52,975
Dad.

164
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:56,353
Were you already aware of everything?

165
00:14:58,188 --> 00:14:59,148
Yes.

166
00:15:00,357 --> 00:15:01,400
And…

167
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:05,571
if it weren't for Do-yun,

168
00:15:06,488 --> 00:15:09,450
we would've had a hard time
protecting this company.

169
00:15:10,868 --> 00:15:14,079
We wouldn't have been able to stop Ji-suk.

170
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:23,589
Yes, sir. Please take
good care of my mother.

171
00:15:25,174 --> 00:15:26,550
Thank you.

172
00:15:33,015 --> 00:15:34,224
What are you doing here?

173
00:15:37,227 --> 00:15:38,228
You know…

174
00:15:40,522 --> 00:15:44,735
Anyway, how's Ji-eun?
She must have been startled.

175
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,780
Thankfully, she's been hanging in there.

176
00:15:52,034 --> 00:15:54,912
You should've told me in advance.

177
00:15:54,995 --> 00:15:57,915
Instead, I suspected you and got angry.

178
00:15:59,166 --> 00:16:00,209
I'm sorry about that.

179
00:16:00,292 --> 00:16:03,087
I had no choice
if I were to fool my mother too.

180
00:16:05,506 --> 00:16:07,257
Will she be all right?

181
00:16:08,592 --> 00:16:11,720
It'll take some time, but she'll be okay.

182
00:16:15,766 --> 00:16:19,228
Thanks, Do-yun,
for protecting Joa Confectionery.

183
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:22,523
It was all you, actually.
You and the other employees.

184
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:25,693
I know.

185
00:16:25,776 --> 00:16:28,904
My feet almost fell off
from all the running I had to do.

186
00:16:30,781 --> 00:16:32,032
You did well.

187
00:16:49,883 --> 00:16:53,929
Come on, puppy. Stop picking at your food.

188
00:16:54,013 --> 00:16:55,806
You should have a hearty breakfast.

189
00:16:56,515 --> 00:16:57,474
Right.

190
00:17:00,686 --> 00:17:02,980
Why do you seem under the weather today?

191
00:17:03,063 --> 00:17:05,274
Did your mother scold you again?

192
00:17:06,150 --> 00:17:07,860
No, of course not.

193
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,492
It's good. It's really delicious.

194
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:20,164
Don't fill your tummy
with snacks all the time

195
00:17:20,914 --> 00:17:22,791
and eat a variety of nutrients.

196
00:17:22,875 --> 00:17:25,627
It's the key to a healthy mind and body.

197
00:17:28,922 --> 00:17:29,882
Here.

198
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:51,904
I know how much you're hurting

199
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,406
and how much pain you're in.

200
00:17:56,533 --> 00:17:58,660
I know what you're going through
better than anyone.

201
00:17:59,536 --> 00:18:00,954
Then do you also know…

202
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:03,332
what I can do

203
00:18:04,124 --> 00:18:06,085
to make things better?

204
00:18:14,968 --> 00:18:17,721
But I do know one thing.

205
00:18:19,223 --> 00:18:22,768
If you keep being like this,

206
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:25,979
Dad will be extremely upset.

207
00:18:28,148 --> 00:18:29,274
Right.

208
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:30,734
So…

209
00:18:32,986 --> 00:18:34,321
don't skip your meals, okay?

210
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:37,366
Okay.

211
00:18:41,703 --> 00:18:42,913
See you later.

212
00:19:08,689 --> 00:19:09,565
Old Lady!

213
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,570
What happened yesterday?

214
00:19:14,653 --> 00:19:16,613
You disappeared
and didn't answer my calls.

215
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:19,241
I went to your place this morning,
but you weren't there.

216
00:19:19,324 --> 00:19:20,576
Is something wrong?

217
00:19:21,827 --> 00:19:22,995
I'll tell you later.

218
00:19:24,663 --> 00:19:26,999
I heard about the meeting.
Congratulations.

219
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,668
It was all thanks to you.

220
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:31,003
I didn't do anything.

221
00:19:32,045 --> 00:19:35,632
Just knowing that you're there for me
is more than enough to cheer me up.

222
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:37,968
Thank you.

223
00:19:38,677 --> 00:19:41,013
I'll call you later.
Let's go home together.

224
00:19:41,597 --> 00:19:43,348
Okay, sure. Let's go inside.

225
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:49,646
JOA CONFECTIONARY

226
00:19:50,439 --> 00:19:51,690
I wonder if she's okay.

227
00:19:57,196 --> 00:19:59,239
It feels a bit empty without the newbie.

228
00:19:59,323 --> 00:20:01,450
-I agree.
-I bet he won't come down here again.

229
00:20:02,034 --> 00:20:03,243
Probably not.

230
00:20:03,327 --> 00:20:06,663
Everyone knows
he's the chairman's son now,

231
00:20:06,747 --> 00:20:08,665
and he even won the big fight.

232
00:20:08,749 --> 00:20:12,419
So he'll probably become
someone really high up in the company.

233
00:20:14,713 --> 00:20:16,089
Ladies.

234
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:17,591
Good morning.

235
00:20:17,674 --> 00:20:19,968
Goodness, I can't believe this.

236
00:20:20,052 --> 00:20:21,845
Why are you back here again?

237
00:20:21,929 --> 00:20:24,681
Isn't it obvious? I'm here to cook.

238
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:28,018
What's wrong? Did I get fired?

239
00:20:28,101 --> 00:20:29,561
Or did I get transferred?

240
00:20:29,645 --> 00:20:31,855
No, it's just that you're
the chairman's son.

241
00:20:31,939 --> 00:20:33,315
Are you allowed to be here?

242
00:20:33,398 --> 00:20:35,025
Gosh, I won't deny

243
00:20:35,692 --> 00:20:38,946
that I'm the chairman's son,
but I'm Han Yu-hyeon,

244
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:40,364
your dummy cook!

245
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:43,325
You're not a dummy anymore.

246
00:20:43,408 --> 00:20:45,786
You're the mascot of the kitchen now.

247
00:20:45,869 --> 00:20:46,828
You're our mascot.

248
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,705
-I'm the mascot.
-That's right.

249
00:20:54,211 --> 00:20:55,212
Ms. Oh.

250
00:20:58,966 --> 00:21:02,344
How long will Ms. Oh be gone?

251
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:05,264
Is she on a leave because of Ms. Han?

252
00:21:05,347 --> 00:21:08,183
Well, she never told us why,

253
00:21:08,267 --> 00:21:10,394
but I totally get why she'd want a break.

254
00:21:10,477 --> 00:21:12,646
Her mother-in-law might end up in prison.

255
00:21:13,188 --> 00:21:14,398
"Prison"?

256
00:21:17,234 --> 00:21:20,946
Does that mean she really tried
to manipulate the stock price?

257
00:21:23,532 --> 00:21:27,744
You don't think anything will happen
to Ms. Oh, do you?

258
00:21:28,245 --> 00:21:29,621
I'm sure she'll be fine.

259
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:32,833
She supported us
when we tried to gain help

260
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:34,710
from our minority shareholders.

261
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,733
Anthony.

262
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,652
How long are you going to do this?

263
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:03,989
If you keep stalling,
it won't do you any good.

264
00:22:04,072 --> 00:22:07,909
He's right.
Anthony, I understand how you feel,

265
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,703
but it's time you get to your senses.

266
00:22:09,786 --> 00:22:10,954
Get out.

267
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:13,290
This isn't going to solve anything!

268
00:22:13,957 --> 00:22:16,001
You're Anthony.

269
00:22:16,084 --> 00:22:18,337
You became a top class actor

270
00:22:18,420 --> 00:22:20,505
with a goal to find your first love.

271
00:22:20,589 --> 00:22:22,215
You're an amazing guy

272
00:22:22,299 --> 00:22:25,927
who came this far by never giving up
even when your popularity faded.

273
00:22:26,011 --> 00:22:27,387
You can't give up like this!

274
00:22:31,433 --> 00:22:34,019
If I become a star,
I could go on TV Loaded With Love.

275
00:22:34,102 --> 00:22:36,480
They can find anyone I want to look for.

276
00:22:38,023 --> 00:22:39,566
That's why I need to do this.

277
00:22:39,649 --> 00:22:41,234
Mr. Yang.

278
00:22:41,318 --> 00:22:43,737
It's true that you assaulted
and tormented those kids.

279
00:22:43,820 --> 00:22:46,239
You and your gang stole money

280
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:47,949
and hit them because you felt like it.

281
00:22:48,033 --> 00:22:51,244
You also mocked poor kids like Ji-eun.

282
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:53,580
The first thing you should do
is apologize,

283
00:22:54,081 --> 00:22:56,333
not hide here.

284
00:23:06,760 --> 00:23:08,887
-Where are you going?
-Anthony.

285
00:23:14,601 --> 00:23:15,644
Old lady.

286
00:23:16,728 --> 00:23:18,772
You seemed down since this morning.

287
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:20,148
Is something wrong?

288
00:23:20,899 --> 00:23:24,277
I went to see my dad
at the cinerarium yesterday.

289
00:23:25,904 --> 00:23:28,698
I'm sorry. I didn't know
your father had passed away.

290
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:30,158
It's okay.

291
00:23:31,660 --> 00:23:33,245
But it wasn't just me.

292
00:23:34,871 --> 00:23:37,541
She also found out
that our dad had passed away.

293
00:23:39,709 --> 00:23:42,671
It was the one thing
I wanted to keep from her.

294
00:23:45,882 --> 00:23:47,259
It's all my fault.

295
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:51,638
I shouldn't have left her all alone.

296
00:23:53,140 --> 00:23:54,683
Don't blame yourself too much.

297
00:23:55,934 --> 00:23:58,061
The shareholders meeting kept you busy.

298
00:23:59,146 --> 00:24:01,481
She's with her family,

299
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,901
so I'm sure she'll overcome it.

300
00:24:06,987 --> 00:24:07,946
Thank you.

301
00:24:08,613 --> 00:24:09,739
But…

302
00:24:11,533 --> 00:24:12,909
are you okay?

303
00:24:16,246 --> 00:24:19,583
It's been ages
since I last visited Dad there.

304
00:24:21,001 --> 00:24:23,587
I couldn't dare visit him,

305
00:24:24,546 --> 00:24:27,215
because I was too scared…

306
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,970
to face him.

307
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,101
I know how that feels.

308
00:24:40,061 --> 00:24:43,231
It was when my mom passed away
when I was little.

309
00:24:44,900 --> 00:24:48,945
I arrived at her funeral,
but all I wanted to do was run away.

310
00:24:49,988 --> 00:24:51,448
I was scared to go inside.

311
00:24:53,408 --> 00:24:54,910
It felt as if

312
00:24:56,119 --> 00:24:59,664
I could turn back time
by not going inside.

313
00:25:04,252 --> 00:25:06,546
It must've been really hard for you.

314
00:25:08,798 --> 00:25:09,633
But…

315
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:15,472
while I was crying outside,
someone suddenly showed up, held my hand,

316
00:25:15,555 --> 00:25:17,515
and took me inside.

317
00:25:19,309 --> 00:25:23,897
That person's hand felt so warm
that I still remember it to this day.

318
00:25:26,566 --> 00:25:27,692
I see.

319
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,909
I wish

320
00:25:36,493 --> 00:25:38,954
I could help you feel

321
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:42,666
the same warmth I felt that day.

322
00:25:48,588 --> 00:25:49,589
Thank you.

323
00:25:50,423 --> 00:25:52,425
I'll cheer up

324
00:25:52,509 --> 00:25:55,804
and do everything I can
to find a way to send her back.

325
00:25:57,722 --> 00:26:02,102
It's the least I can do to repay her
for all that she's given me.

326
00:26:05,021 --> 00:26:06,147
Let's do it together.

327
00:26:06,815 --> 00:26:08,858
I'm sure there will be a way.

328
00:26:21,079 --> 00:26:21,997
Anthony.

329
00:26:24,249 --> 00:26:25,333
Hey, Ha-ni.

330
00:26:26,084 --> 00:26:29,379
I was worried about you.
You never picked up my calls.

331
00:26:30,672 --> 00:26:31,631
Are you okay?

332
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:35,385
I don't know.

333
00:26:36,845 --> 00:26:39,681
I wanted to talk about it with someone,

334
00:26:41,474 --> 00:26:43,852
and you're the only person who knows

335
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:47,480
how foolish I can be.

336
00:26:51,860 --> 00:26:52,777
Yu-hyeon.

337
00:26:53,820 --> 00:26:55,739
Right. I'll give you some privacy.

338
00:27:05,915 --> 00:27:08,209
I'm all ears.

339
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,503
Go ahead and tell me.

340
00:27:13,840 --> 00:27:17,510
Your daughter came to see me
at the hotel I was hiding at.

341
00:27:20,430 --> 00:27:22,349
She went to see you?

342
00:27:22,432 --> 00:27:24,142
She told me…

343
00:27:25,226 --> 00:27:27,896
that the first thing I should do
is apologize.

344
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,690
She said I shouldn't be hiding.

345
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:34,110
She talked as if she knew me
from 20 years ago.

346
00:27:36,071 --> 00:27:38,448
I felt so embarrassed,

347
00:27:40,283 --> 00:27:41,951
and I wanted to run away.

348
00:27:46,373 --> 00:27:47,290
Chun-sik.

349
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:51,169
Honestly, I felt the same way.

350
00:27:52,212 --> 00:27:54,047
I always wanted to run away

351
00:27:54,756 --> 00:27:56,341
from the girl I was 20 years ago.

352
00:27:58,635 --> 00:28:02,055
But once I started to face my past,

353
00:28:02,764 --> 00:28:04,682
I started gaining the courage to change.

354
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:10,438
So instead of avoiding your past,

355
00:28:11,439 --> 00:28:15,068
I hope you are able to stand
face to face with your past self.

356
00:28:18,822 --> 00:28:19,739
I'm sure

357
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:23,618
you already know what you need to do

358
00:28:24,744 --> 00:28:26,287
to make up for your past mistakes.

359
00:28:33,503 --> 00:28:34,671
Okay, thanks.

360
00:28:36,464 --> 00:28:39,134
I really hated my past,

361
00:28:40,635 --> 00:28:42,470
but I guess I did one thing right.

362
00:28:45,098 --> 00:28:46,850
Liking you, I mean.

363
00:28:50,353 --> 00:28:51,271
I'll go now.

364
00:28:52,147 --> 00:28:53,523
Have a safe trip home.

365
00:29:02,240 --> 00:29:03,283
Cheer up.

366
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:16,796
You really are amazing.

367
00:29:18,006 --> 00:29:19,132
What do you mean?

368
00:29:22,343 --> 00:29:24,262
What's this sound?

369
00:29:24,345 --> 00:29:25,847
I think it's coming from inside.

370
00:29:27,140 --> 00:29:28,683
What is this sound?

371
00:29:40,904 --> 00:29:42,197
How is this…

372
00:29:42,697 --> 00:29:43,990
Hurry and answer it.

373
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,242
Your grandmother said you had to
answer this for her to live.

374
00:29:50,205 --> 00:29:51,206
Hello?

375
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:54,542
Ha-ni, it's me, your dad.

376
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,713
Dad?

377
00:30:00,381 --> 00:30:02,634
Ha-ni, I'm sorry.

378
00:30:03,259 --> 00:30:05,762
Dad, how in the world…

379
00:30:05,845 --> 00:30:07,555
I wanted to help you,

380
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:10,809
but it only ended up putting you
and your past self in danger.

381
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:13,520
-Dad.
-Ha-ni, there's not enough time.

382
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:15,897
-You need to find the way.
-What?

383
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,817
What do you mean?

384
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,569
Think about it carefully.
I'm sure you know the way.

385
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:24,030
You must find the way back, okay?

386
00:30:29,118 --> 00:30:30,245
Dad.

387
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:31,663
Dad!

388
00:30:41,256 --> 00:30:44,050
Didn't you say your father passed away?

389
00:30:45,385 --> 00:30:46,886
It really was Dad.

390
00:30:46,970 --> 00:30:50,473
Dad who passed away 20 years ago.

391
00:30:51,808 --> 00:30:53,017
But…

392
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,603
how is this possible?

393
00:30:57,772 --> 00:31:00,775
He told me to find the way back.

394
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:03,903
The way back?
What's that supposed to mean?

395
00:31:03,987 --> 00:31:06,155
He told me I'd know,

396
00:31:06,239 --> 00:31:07,699
but I don't think I do.

397
00:31:10,785 --> 00:31:12,662
If only I could talk to him longer.

398
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,920
"Seven days left"?

399
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:24,173
What's this?

400
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:29,721
What happens in seven days?

401
00:31:29,804 --> 00:31:31,222
Is it your birthday?

402
00:31:31,764 --> 00:31:34,309
There's not enough time.
You need to find the way.

403
00:31:34,392 --> 00:31:37,061
Think about it carefully.
I'm sure you know the way.

404
00:31:37,145 --> 00:31:38,479
There's no time?

405
00:31:40,857 --> 00:31:42,108
Was he

406
00:31:44,068 --> 00:31:45,320
referring to this?

407
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:58,750
I'll protect you.

408
00:32:07,508 --> 00:32:08,635
My Lord.

409
00:32:09,177 --> 00:32:11,471
Please hear my prayer.

410
00:32:12,221 --> 00:32:15,058
Please help me use the rest of my life

411
00:32:15,683 --> 00:32:20,188
to give light, strength,

412
00:32:21,522 --> 00:32:23,733
and courage to this child.

413
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:30,031
Please protect my Ha-ni from all evil,

414
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,368
and please help her

415
00:32:35,411 --> 00:32:38,164
overcome whatever hardships

416
00:32:39,874 --> 00:32:42,543
that she may face…

417
00:33:15,451 --> 00:33:16,494
Why is that…

418
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,838
Hey, it's me.

419
00:33:28,047 --> 00:33:29,549
Is everything okay?

420
00:33:40,685 --> 00:33:41,978
What happened?

421
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:43,146
Grandma…

422
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:57,160
We found her unconscious this morning.

423
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,748
She woke up not too soon after,

424
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,585
but she kept
refusing to go to the hospital.

425
00:34:06,502 --> 00:34:08,546
She insisted on staying with her.

426
00:34:10,256 --> 00:34:11,299
What did Ha-yeong say?

427
00:34:12,133 --> 00:34:14,302
Apparently, she's become very weak.

428
00:34:14,385 --> 00:34:17,263
Fortunately, she wasn't injured
or anything,

429
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:23,811
but I was scared
to see her fall unconscious.

430
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,109
I'm sure she'll be okay.

431
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,487
Don't worry too much.

432
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:34,447
Okay.

433
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,743
-But don't you need to go to work?
-I took the day off.

434
00:34:39,535 --> 00:34:42,080
I need to go somewhere today.

435
00:34:44,791 --> 00:34:46,042
Must we go today?

436
00:34:46,125 --> 00:34:47,960
I'm really worried about Grandma.

437
00:34:48,044 --> 00:34:49,754
We have no time.

438
00:34:50,505 --> 00:34:52,840
We can't just wait for that man to call.

439
00:34:52,924 --> 00:34:54,467
Did something happen?

440
00:34:54,550 --> 00:34:56,052
I'll tell you on our way.

441
00:34:56,135 --> 00:34:57,553
Do you have your wallet?

442
00:34:58,179 --> 00:34:59,263
Yes.

443
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:05,269
Mr. Blue Bird.

444
00:35:05,353 --> 00:35:07,605
You really don't need to help.

445
00:35:07,688 --> 00:35:10,817
Did you forget the recent accident?
I can't let you go by yourselves.

446
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,194
Get in.

447
00:35:13,820 --> 00:35:14,862
Thank you.

448
00:35:22,995 --> 00:35:25,414
The talisman is in your wallet, right?

449
00:35:25,498 --> 00:35:26,791
Of course.

450
00:35:28,334 --> 00:35:29,335
See?

451
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,263
What? Why has it changed?

452
00:35:40,346 --> 00:35:41,556
This too.

453
00:35:42,557 --> 00:35:44,183
What do you mean? "This too"?

454
00:35:45,768 --> 00:35:48,563
The talisman above our door
has turned black as well.

455
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:50,106
Just like this one.

456
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:54,068
Does that mean it's no longer effective?

457
00:35:55,194 --> 00:35:58,114
Is death approaching me once again?

458
00:36:05,246 --> 00:36:06,747
Dad called.

459
00:36:09,876 --> 00:36:11,169
He called this phone.

460
00:36:13,921 --> 00:36:16,507
Really? He did?

461
00:36:16,591 --> 00:36:19,677
Remember when Grandma told you
that you had to pick up a call

462
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:21,971
from this old phone if you wanted to live?

463
00:36:22,054 --> 00:36:24,348
And you also heard it ring.

464
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:27,602
The person who called then

465
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:29,312
was Dad.

466
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:34,567
What did he say?

467
00:36:35,234 --> 00:36:38,571
He said we have to find a way
to take you back.

468
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:47,538
Death is getting stronger.

469
00:36:50,333 --> 00:36:51,751
Seeing how you're still alive,

470
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:54,921
someone must be protecting you from it.

471
00:36:55,004 --> 00:36:56,255
What do you mean?

472
00:36:56,339 --> 00:36:58,633
Has anything happened to someone
around you?

473
00:36:58,716 --> 00:37:01,844
Perhaps, they got injured
or their illness worsened.

474
00:37:01,928 --> 00:37:03,512
Does that mean Grandma…

475
00:37:04,096 --> 00:37:06,098
Then what can we do?

476
00:37:06,182 --> 00:37:08,768
Should we get a stronger talisman?

477
00:37:08,851 --> 00:37:11,562
This is only temporary.
We need to get to the core of it.

478
00:37:11,646 --> 00:37:13,481
No talisman can stop

479
00:37:13,564 --> 00:37:15,483
the time from ticking.

480
00:37:15,566 --> 00:37:16,567
"Time"?

481
00:37:18,819 --> 00:37:19,820
Wait.

482
00:37:22,782 --> 00:37:24,367
Are you talking about this?

483
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,620
How long has this been here?

484
00:37:27,703 --> 00:37:28,871
Ever since I came here.

485
00:37:29,789 --> 00:37:32,166
Back then, it said "100 days".

486
00:37:33,709 --> 00:37:35,169
6 DAYS LEFT

487
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:38,047
We really are running out of time.

488
00:37:38,130 --> 00:37:40,925
She needs to go back
before something worse happens.

489
00:37:41,717 --> 00:37:43,135
But how?

490
00:37:46,389 --> 00:37:48,641
Didn't your father tell you everything?

491
00:37:48,724 --> 00:37:51,519
Find out how at all costs.
You're the only one who can.

492
00:37:53,521 --> 00:37:54,730
If I do manage…

493
00:37:56,857 --> 00:37:58,526
to go back in time,

494
00:37:58,609 --> 00:38:01,612
would I be able to save my dad?

495
00:38:02,488 --> 00:38:05,366
No, I'm going to see to it no matter what.

496
00:38:05,866 --> 00:38:06,742
I'll save him.

497
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,244
Is that…

498
00:38:09,620 --> 00:38:10,913
possible?

499
00:38:16,210 --> 00:38:17,295
No.

500
00:38:19,213 --> 00:38:20,423
Why not?

501
00:38:21,007 --> 00:38:22,800
I've already seen the future,

502
00:38:22,883 --> 00:38:24,885
so I can prevent his death.

503
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:26,470
You shouldn't change the past.

504
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,390
If you go back and change the past,

505
00:38:30,182 --> 00:38:31,809
your present self will be in peril.

506
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,895
You could completely vanish
from this world.

507
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,280
Then what should I do?

508
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:55,958
-Grandma.
-Yes?

509
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,044
How much do you love me?

510
00:38:58,127 --> 00:39:00,629
To the moon and back?

511
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:02,131
No.

512
00:39:02,214 --> 00:39:06,844
I love you so much that I could sacrifice
my own life for you.

513
00:39:07,553 --> 00:39:09,180
I'm so darn popular.

514
00:39:09,263 --> 00:39:13,267
Then promise me you'll only love me
until the day you die.

515
00:39:13,351 --> 00:39:14,477
You bet.

516
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:20,149
I love you with all of my heart.

517
00:39:23,652 --> 00:39:26,864
I love you too, Grandma…

518
00:39:28,616 --> 00:39:30,493
with all of my heart.

519
00:39:34,705 --> 00:39:36,248
And…

520
00:39:38,709 --> 00:39:39,877
I'm sorry.

521
00:39:45,883 --> 00:39:47,218
Dad called?

522
00:39:50,679 --> 00:39:52,014
Unbelievable.

523
00:39:52,098 --> 00:39:53,766
He passed away 20 years ago,

524
00:39:53,849 --> 00:39:56,352
so how could he have called you
on that old phone?

525
00:39:56,435 --> 00:39:58,062
I don't know.

526
00:39:59,271 --> 00:40:00,356
But…

527
00:40:01,690 --> 00:40:03,150
it really was him.

528
00:40:03,234 --> 00:40:04,735
Does that mean…

529
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,115
Yes.

530
00:40:10,324 --> 00:40:14,120
I'm sure it was him.

531
00:40:15,496 --> 00:40:17,289
The love he had for his daughters

532
00:40:18,582 --> 00:40:20,626
was truly immeasurable.

533
00:40:25,881 --> 00:40:29,802
He must have been heartbroken
to see how you had changed

534
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,554
after the incident.

535
00:40:33,889 --> 00:40:38,018
Thanks to him, you could open your heart
once again and reach out to us.

536
00:40:39,353 --> 00:40:40,354
You're right.

537
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:45,609
He sent my younger self to me as a gift.

538
00:40:49,363 --> 00:40:51,824
That's how I was able to change.

539
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:04,044
When you're feeling down,
Just sing like me

540
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,131
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

541
00:41:07,214 --> 00:41:09,842
Dad, are you tone-deaf?
You're a terrible singer.

542
00:41:09,925 --> 00:41:11,594
Who are you calling tone-deaf?

543
00:41:11,677 --> 00:41:13,929
I sound better than them, don't I?

544
00:41:14,013 --> 00:41:16,432
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

545
00:41:29,528 --> 00:41:30,946
Dad.

546
00:41:35,409 --> 00:41:38,954
-What's behind your back?
-Something you always wanted.

547
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:42,208
Could it be…

548
00:41:43,292 --> 00:41:44,960
Ta-da.

549
00:41:46,003 --> 00:41:48,797
You're the best!

550
00:41:48,881 --> 00:41:49,715
Here you go.

551
00:41:52,426 --> 00:41:53,719
Let's see.

552
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:00,726
Dad, should we take one together?

553
00:42:00,809 --> 00:42:02,478
Sure. Let's stand over here.

554
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:04,396
-All right.
-Okay.

555
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,357
One, two, three.

556
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:08,484
-Kimchi.
-Kimchi.

557
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,074
Dad…

558
00:42:34,969 --> 00:42:37,137
What if I go back…

559
00:42:40,015 --> 00:42:41,267
and he dies?

560
00:42:42,268 --> 00:42:44,144
I'm scared.

561
00:42:45,688 --> 00:42:47,690
I don't think I can live with myself

562
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:52,236
if he dies like that.

563
00:42:55,489 --> 00:42:56,657
"Why?

564
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,744
Why did she come into my life?"

565
00:43:02,788 --> 00:43:04,999
At first, I really disliked you.

566
00:43:07,126 --> 00:43:08,669
But now, I get it.

567
00:43:09,962 --> 00:43:12,089
Dad sent you to me.

568
00:43:14,133 --> 00:43:15,092
He did?

569
00:43:17,970 --> 00:43:21,223
My life had been completely ruined,

570
00:43:23,851 --> 00:43:28,272
and Dad wanted to remind me
of how I used to be.

571
00:43:30,065 --> 00:43:33,902
He wanted to tell me that through you.

572
00:43:37,323 --> 00:43:38,407
He wanted to show…

573
00:43:40,326 --> 00:43:42,453
how radiant…

574
00:43:46,290 --> 00:43:48,459
we were.

575
00:43:55,215 --> 00:43:58,010
COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES
JOA CONFECTIONERY

576
00:44:01,305 --> 00:44:02,514
COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES

577
00:44:09,021 --> 00:44:10,189
-Anthony.
-Anthony.

578
00:44:13,400 --> 00:44:16,528
Jeong-man.
I want to hold a press conference.

579
00:44:25,746 --> 00:44:28,457
Thank you. Because of you and that kid,

580
00:44:29,208 --> 00:44:31,877
I've finally mustered up the courage
to face my past self.

581
00:45:05,494 --> 00:45:07,746
Hello, I'm Anthony.

582
00:45:14,920 --> 00:45:19,800
First of all, I'd like to sincerely thank
all of you for coming…

583
00:45:27,933 --> 00:45:29,059
What's going on?

584
00:45:35,149 --> 00:45:36,400
Why isn't he reading it?

585
00:45:45,784 --> 00:45:48,579
ANTHONY'S WRITTEN APOLOGY
HELLO, I'M ANTHONY

586
00:45:55,002 --> 00:45:56,086
I admit to

587
00:45:57,379 --> 00:45:59,173
all the accusations of bullying

588
00:46:01,383 --> 00:46:02,634
that were made recently.

589
00:46:08,557 --> 00:46:10,517
I'd also like to apologize

590
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:14,104
to all the people
who have suffered losses because of me.

591
00:46:15,189 --> 00:46:19,151
But most of all,
I'd like to sincerely apologize

592
00:46:20,694 --> 00:46:22,196
to the victims of bullying

593
00:46:24,198 --> 00:46:27,910
that I had committed in the past.

594
00:46:36,668 --> 00:46:40,964
I thought it was right to
apologize to them in person.

595
00:46:42,049 --> 00:46:42,925
But…

596
00:46:44,259 --> 00:46:47,346
I realized that it could also
be another form of violence.

597
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:51,767
From this moment on…

598
00:46:54,770 --> 00:46:55,979
I, Anthony,

599
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,399
I will leave…

600
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:03,487
the entertainment industry.

601
00:47:07,866 --> 00:47:11,787
I am truly grateful for all the love
you have given me thus far.

602
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,498
And I am terribly sorry.

603
00:47:15,332 --> 00:47:19,253
I will never be able
to undo what I've done.

604
00:47:21,004 --> 00:47:22,381
I'm really sorry.

605
00:47:24,299 --> 00:47:26,134
I will repent for what I did…

606
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,636
Dear my younger self.

607
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:31,473
Ever since you came here,

608
00:47:32,182 --> 00:47:35,477
you have changed the lives
of those around you.

609
00:47:55,414 --> 00:47:56,456
Anthony.

610
00:48:04,673 --> 00:48:07,968
You must have been shocked. I'm sorry.
I should've told you in advance.

611
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:12,097
But this is the right thing to do.

612
00:48:15,851 --> 00:48:16,685
Anthony…

613
00:48:17,352 --> 00:48:19,062
Gyeong-sik, I'm sorry…

614
00:48:20,814 --> 00:48:22,608
that I couldn't be a better celebrity.

615
00:48:26,361 --> 00:48:28,071
Don't cry. Okay?

616
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,532
Anthony…

617
00:48:36,204 --> 00:48:37,372
I'm sorry.

618
00:48:38,540 --> 00:48:40,250
Don't be.

619
00:48:41,168 --> 00:48:44,671
I always tried to look tough.

620
00:48:47,507 --> 00:48:50,677
I think I was just trying to hide
how lonely and afraid I was.

621
00:48:53,472 --> 00:48:54,431
Thank you…

622
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:58,602
for currying favor with someone like me.

623
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:06,193
Don't thank me.

624
00:49:08,779 --> 00:49:11,657
Do you know when I felt the happiest…

625
00:49:14,159 --> 00:49:15,577
and the greatest?

626
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:22,376
It was whenever I was

627
00:49:23,877 --> 00:49:25,921
with my beloved star.

628
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:34,137
Me too.

629
00:49:36,890 --> 00:49:40,268
Cutting through the rough waves…

630
00:49:40,352 --> 00:49:41,353
Thank you.

631
00:49:43,897 --> 00:49:44,981
I'm truly grateful.

632
00:49:45,065 --> 00:49:49,444
…we gradually became better people.

633
00:49:57,411 --> 00:49:58,787
Look at me too.

634
00:49:59,913 --> 00:50:02,833
Fine. Go to bed.

635
00:50:02,916 --> 00:50:04,292
Sleep.

636
00:50:14,136 --> 00:50:15,095
Come join us.

637
00:50:39,953 --> 00:50:42,164
You were such a pretty, little girl.

638
00:50:42,748 --> 00:50:43,874
But back then,

639
00:50:44,916 --> 00:50:47,878
I was too busy raising you two

640
00:50:48,587 --> 00:50:50,422
to notice.

641
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,226
After 20 years…

642
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:06,021
After you entered our lives,

643
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:08,565
we finally learned…

644
00:51:11,651 --> 00:51:13,195
We learned

645
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:17,616
how to embrace and comfort each other
in times of pain.

646
00:51:59,741 --> 00:52:01,368
That took you long enough.

647
00:52:02,828 --> 00:52:06,206
I had to take care of the company
and Uncle as well.

648
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:08,166
I was busy.

649
00:52:09,668 --> 00:52:11,461
-How are you?
-What do you think?

650
00:52:13,171 --> 00:52:15,131
Do I look peachy to you?

651
00:52:15,757 --> 00:52:17,342
Do I look fine?

652
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:20,136
Your mother has been suffering in here,

653
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:23,056
and you finally managed to come
with a lawyer.

654
00:52:27,185 --> 00:52:29,145
How dare you betray me?

655
00:52:30,105 --> 00:52:31,857
You, of all people?

656
00:52:32,607 --> 00:52:33,817
I gave my all to you

657
00:52:34,609 --> 00:52:36,987
to retrieve what is rightfully ours.

658
00:52:37,821 --> 00:52:38,989
Everything.

659
00:52:42,951 --> 00:52:45,203
At first, I thought the same way.

660
00:52:46,746 --> 00:52:50,417
I thought it was the only way
to protect the ones I loved. However…

661
00:52:51,167 --> 00:52:53,295
I was wrong, and you were too.

662
00:52:54,588 --> 00:52:56,882
I had to make things right
before it was too late.

663
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,428
I…

664
00:53:04,014 --> 00:53:05,473
I wasn't wrong.

665
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:10,020
Please.

666
00:53:11,688 --> 00:53:13,023
Just let go.

667
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,911
I'll make sure you won't feel lonely

668
00:53:26,828 --> 00:53:27,829
anymore.

669
00:53:29,581 --> 00:53:32,000
Ji-eun is worried sick about you.

670
00:53:32,667 --> 00:53:36,755
And Uncle spends the entire day
in your empty office.

671
00:53:41,468 --> 00:53:42,302
We'll wait

672
00:53:43,762 --> 00:53:46,765
until you come back to us.

673
00:54:21,508 --> 00:54:24,636
Tell me how I can be of help.

674
00:54:24,719 --> 00:54:27,347
Quit spewing nonsense and scaring them.

675
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:29,557
I told you guys already.

676
00:54:30,308 --> 00:54:32,310
She's the one who knows the answer.

677
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:36,523
Anyone could say that. Even I could.

678
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,358
Be careful what you say to me.

679
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:40,986
"Go pray somewhere. Go visit someone."

680
00:54:41,069 --> 00:54:42,988
You see these scenes in the movies.

681
00:54:43,071 --> 00:54:44,489
Light shines down from the sky

682
00:54:44,572 --> 00:54:46,992
and takes the spirit away.

683
00:54:47,075 --> 00:54:49,911
Give us some details, will you?

684
00:54:49,995 --> 00:54:51,371
"You can't do this or that.

685
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:53,039
Think. You know the answer."

686
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:55,667
The old lady and the kid
are just waiting anxiously.

687
00:54:56,584 --> 00:54:57,919
Is this a joke to you?

688
00:55:01,464 --> 00:55:03,550
Don't stare at me like that.
You're scaring me.

689
00:55:04,676 --> 00:55:05,552
Never mind.

690
00:55:06,553 --> 00:55:07,846
You're a fool

691
00:55:07,929 --> 00:55:11,850
who neither listens nor remembers,
so what could I say to you?

692
00:55:11,933 --> 00:55:14,352
"A fool"? Who are you calling a fool?

693
00:55:14,436 --> 00:55:16,021
You shouldn't be here.

694
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,107
Be by her side.

695
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:22,068
When one is too burdened,

696
00:55:22,152 --> 00:55:24,112
one fails to see what's in front of them.

697
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:28,158
They'll fall deeper and deeper
into their own thoughts.

698
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:31,703
You should shed some light

699
00:55:31,786 --> 00:55:33,329
and pull her out of there.

700
00:55:35,957 --> 00:55:37,292
Reach out to her.

701
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:38,793
Remember what happened to you.

702
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:42,172
To me?

703
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:48,553
I wanted to stay by Grandma's side.

704
00:55:49,220 --> 00:55:52,515
Mom has been busy
taking her to the hospital,

705
00:55:52,599 --> 00:55:54,976
and no one will be home
once Ha-yeong goes to work.

706
00:55:55,060 --> 00:55:57,145
-What about your work?
-I took a few days off.

707
00:55:58,188 --> 00:56:01,524
I'll be by your side at all times,
so don't you worry.

708
00:56:02,275 --> 00:56:03,526
Okay.

709
00:56:08,114 --> 00:56:10,825
They're our old diaries and photos.

710
00:56:10,909 --> 00:56:11,868
You're right.

711
00:56:12,368 --> 00:56:17,040
Maybe there could be hints in here
about what Dad said.

712
00:56:18,541 --> 00:56:20,710
It's a collection of photos that he took.

713
00:56:23,046 --> 00:56:25,673
Dad and I used to look at the photos

714
00:56:25,757 --> 00:56:29,010
we took together.

715
00:56:40,313 --> 00:56:41,689
Who is it?

716
00:56:41,773 --> 00:56:43,233
Delivery.

717
00:56:44,609 --> 00:56:45,777
Yu-hyeon?

718
00:56:51,282 --> 00:56:52,575
This is a surprise.

719
00:56:53,993 --> 00:56:54,911
Ta-da.

720
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,664
-What is that?
-It's for our birthday party.

721
00:56:58,873 --> 00:57:01,000
-It's not my birthday.
-It's mine.

722
00:57:04,838 --> 00:57:06,005
You're here too.

723
00:57:08,007 --> 00:57:10,093
Ta-da. This is for you.

724
00:57:10,176 --> 00:57:12,303
I heard you saying
that it was your birthday.

725
00:57:12,387 --> 00:57:13,680
Really?

726
00:57:16,015 --> 00:57:16,975
Ta-da.

727
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:21,104
Is it really your birthday?
This is so sudden.

728
00:57:21,187 --> 00:57:22,814
Yes, it is.

729
00:57:22,897 --> 00:57:24,983
A month from today.

730
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:26,067
-What?
-What?

731
00:57:26,151 --> 00:57:27,986
You'll congratulate me, right?

732
00:57:31,322 --> 00:57:33,533
Now, you should blow out the candle.

733
00:57:33,616 --> 00:57:35,535
But it'll be your birthday in a month.

734
00:57:35,618 --> 00:57:37,245
Come on. You do it.

735
00:57:37,328 --> 00:57:40,790
Anything you wish for will come true.

736
00:57:40,874 --> 00:57:41,916
You can do it too.

737
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,835
I'll let you just this once.

738
00:58:13,573 --> 00:58:14,908
How is it? Isn't it tasty?

739
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,285
It is.

740
00:58:17,368 --> 00:58:18,578
Let me try.

741
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,127
It's soft and savory.

742
00:58:29,881 --> 00:58:30,840
It's good.

743
00:58:32,592 --> 00:58:34,219
To be frank,

744
00:58:34,302 --> 00:58:37,847
I just wanted to make you smile.

745
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,226
I wanted to lessen
the burden you've been carrying.

746
00:58:41,309 --> 00:58:43,895
But then again,
this was all I could prepare.

747
00:58:43,978 --> 00:58:45,188
Thank you.

748
00:58:46,105 --> 00:58:49,567
Thanks to you,
my heart feels much lighter.

749
00:58:51,319 --> 00:58:52,403
I'm glad.

750
00:58:56,824 --> 00:58:59,244
What's going on here?

751
00:58:59,327 --> 00:59:01,871
Did something happen between you two
while I was away?

752
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:05,291
Well…

753
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,043
I'll bring some beverages.

754
00:59:07,126 --> 00:59:08,419
Okay.

755
00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:14,300
What? What were you looking at?

756
00:59:14,384 --> 00:59:17,387
They're photos my dad took.
He enjoyed taking photos.

757
00:59:18,137 --> 00:59:19,389
-May I see them?
-Sure.

758
00:59:23,101 --> 00:59:24,227
He's good.

759
00:59:32,527 --> 00:59:33,695
What?

760
00:59:43,037 --> 00:59:44,372
BAHN GI-TAE

761
00:59:54,340 --> 00:59:55,508
He's…

762
01:00:02,807 --> 01:00:03,850
What is it?

763
01:00:07,145 --> 01:00:09,981
This was your dad?

764
01:00:11,107 --> 01:00:12,108
Yes.

765
01:00:14,193 --> 01:00:15,194
That's my dad.

766
01:01:06,120 --> 01:01:07,330
This is him.

767
01:01:07,413 --> 01:01:08,831
Come on.

768
01:01:08,915 --> 01:01:10,708
Is this what he meant?

769
01:01:10,792 --> 01:01:12,669
What does that mean?

770
01:01:13,586 --> 01:01:15,672
I only have three days left.

771
01:01:18,466 --> 01:01:20,635
I'm worried sick about her.

772
01:01:20,718 --> 01:01:24,931
I'll come running if anything happens.
So feel free to call me whenever.

773
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:28,601
Dad, help.

774
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:30,728
So that she can get back safely.

775
01:01:30,812 --> 01:01:33,856
I think I found the way back.

776
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:38,695
Thank you for protecting me until now.

777
01:01:38,778 --> 01:01:42,782
