1
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,452
Did you get back safely?

2
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,581
I bet it hasn't changed much.

3
00:01:23,833 --> 00:01:26,836
How silly of me.
I forgot to say hello, didn't I?

4
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:32,008
Hello…

5
00:01:35,595 --> 00:01:36,721
me.

EPISODE 1

00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,494
EMERGENCY CENTER

8
00:02:01,830 --> 00:02:03,414
Come on. Hurry!

9
00:02:04,040 --> 00:02:04,874
Who do we have?

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:05,959
A traffic accident.

11
00:02:06,042 --> 00:02:07,836
-She's unconscious with shallow breaths.
-Her vitals?

12
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:09,671
-Unstable
-Let's hook her up.

13
00:02:13,049 --> 00:02:15,260
People say that all kinds of thoughts

14
00:02:16,177 --> 00:02:18,388
flash through your head
at the brink of death.

15
00:02:19,472 --> 00:02:20,932
In my case though,

16
00:02:21,724 --> 00:02:23,768
only one thought came to mind.

17
00:02:27,021 --> 00:02:27,981
Please…

18
00:02:29,774 --> 00:02:30,775
Just please…

19
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:32,986
don't

20
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,406
let me wake up.

21
00:02:37,699 --> 00:02:40,326
-Cardiac arrest. Perform CPR!
-Performing CPR.

22
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,705
Defibrillator!

23
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,458
Hold on a second.

24
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:50,670
-What are you doing?
-Charge 150 Joules.

25
00:02:52,046 --> 00:02:53,298
No, don't.

26
00:02:53,381 --> 00:02:55,800
-Please, don't do anything.
-Clear.

27
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:02,974
You're probably busy enough,
so don't bother to save me.

28
00:03:03,725 --> 00:03:04,934
Please, I beg you!

29
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:07,395
My life couldn't possibly be any worse

30
00:03:07,478 --> 00:03:09,898
and being born again
is the only option I have left!

31
00:03:10,773 --> 00:03:12,025
Charge 200 Joules.

32
00:03:19,574 --> 00:03:22,744
My heart,
don't you dare start pumping again.

33
00:03:24,078 --> 00:03:26,539
Living as the 37-year-old Bahn Ha-ni…

34
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,708
She's back.

35
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:33,129
I'm better off dead at this point.

36
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,346

Oh, everybody loves it

53
00:04:31,062 --> 00:04:32,689
Everyone!

54
00:04:32,772 --> 00:04:36,025
I present you Squid-good,
the latest snack from Joa Confectionery.

55
00:04:36,109 --> 00:04:38,403
Please have a taste.

56
00:04:38,486 --> 00:04:40,363
Yes, come over here.

57
00:04:45,326 --> 00:04:47,954
You only get a taste, not two fistfuls.

58
00:04:48,037 --> 00:04:49,205
If you want more,

59
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:53,876
ask your mom to buy you
a packet of the snack

60
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:55,712
that the young lady is selling.

61
00:04:56,796 --> 00:04:58,840
-Old lady.
-What?

62
00:04:59,507 --> 00:05:01,551
You're old, not young.

63
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:05,054
What do you think you're doing?

64
00:05:05,847 --> 00:05:07,724
You must be his mother.

65
00:05:07,807 --> 00:05:09,934
It's the newly released snack,
and you can get

66
00:05:10,018 --> 00:05:13,187
-for a buy-one-get-one-free deal--
-Are you out of your mind?

67
00:05:15,273 --> 00:05:17,525
-Sorry?
-What are you feeding my boy?

68
00:05:20,069 --> 00:05:22,155
-It's Squid-good.
-Squid?

69
00:05:24,699 --> 00:05:26,367
My boy! Are you all right?

70
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,245
Someone, please call the paramedics.

71
00:05:29,829 --> 00:05:31,414
My dear boy!

72
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,125
Ha-ni, you must be startled. Oh, dear.

73
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,710
I'm all right.

74
00:05:36,336 --> 00:05:38,296
So how's the boy?

75
00:05:38,379 --> 00:05:39,255
You have no idea.

76
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:42,842
The boy's been hospitalized
but the mom's throwing a fit.

77
00:05:42,925 --> 00:05:44,343
But why?

78
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:47,889
-This isn't our fault though.
-Customer complaints have nothing

79
00:05:47,972 --> 00:05:49,682
to do with us being at fault.

80
00:05:49,766 --> 00:05:54,228
It's up to the customers to decide
who's right and who's wrong.

81
00:05:56,481 --> 00:05:57,940
When will I find everything?

82
00:06:00,610 --> 00:06:02,737
What are you doing, sir?

83
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,616
I'm packing up my things
since I may be reassigned.

84
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:11,037
The mom's adamant about suing
the supermarket and Joa Confectionery.

85
00:06:12,955 --> 00:06:13,956
She's suing?

86
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:16,209
Ha-ni, there's no need for you to worry.

87
00:06:16,292 --> 00:06:18,920
I'll get down on my knees
and beg for forgiveness

88
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:21,089
although I can't say that'll work.

89
00:06:21,172 --> 00:06:23,841
-But sir…
-Just a second.

90
00:06:24,592 --> 00:06:25,760
Yes, honey.

91
00:06:26,260 --> 00:06:29,388
You want our youngest
to take piano lessons?

92
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:32,600
Of course not. Why?
Because I'll be fired soon.

93
00:06:33,643 --> 00:06:36,229
Our eldest should stop
taking English classes too.

94
00:06:36,729 --> 00:06:38,231
Are you kidding me?

95
00:06:38,314 --> 00:06:39,440
Go ahead and drink that.

96
00:06:39,524 --> 00:06:41,442
I told you that I'll be fired soon.

97
00:06:42,151 --> 00:06:43,736
Globalization, my ass.

98
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:46,197
I'm hanging up!
I should just divorce her, damn it.

99
00:06:48,533 --> 00:06:49,742
So which hospital…

100
00:06:50,952 --> 00:06:51,994
is the boy at?

101
00:06:52,078 --> 00:06:54,789
Are you volunteering to go on my behalf?

102
00:06:56,165 --> 00:06:57,917
Why not? I'll give you a ride.

103
00:07:01,671 --> 00:07:04,882
You must be wondering
if this is what made me want to die.

104
00:07:06,134 --> 00:07:07,176
As if.

105
00:07:08,010 --> 00:07:12,181
If that was the case, one out of two
people with jobs would be dead.

106
00:07:12,265 --> 00:07:13,307
Ms. Bahn Ha-ni?

107
00:07:16,185 --> 00:07:17,061
Do I know you?

108
00:07:17,145 --> 00:07:19,313
I'm Lee Man-jin
from Gangnam Police Station.

109
00:07:20,481 --> 00:07:22,859
You're under arrest for failing
to comply with the summons.

110
00:07:23,484 --> 00:07:26,612
But why? I didn't do anything wrong.

111
00:07:26,696 --> 00:07:28,656
You can explain yourself at the station.

112
00:07:28,739 --> 00:07:30,575
-You have the right to remain--
-Mister.

113
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:32,994
I mean, Detective.

114
00:07:33,077 --> 00:07:34,203
Just a second.

115
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,664
I really didn't do anything wrong.

116
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:39,709
No, that's not what I said.

117
00:07:39,792 --> 00:07:41,294
Unbelievable.

118
00:07:42,378 --> 00:07:45,548
-Can you believe it?
-Darn it.

119
00:07:45,631 --> 00:07:47,341
What's with that squid?

120
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:49,343
She was accused of slander.

121
00:07:49,427 --> 00:07:51,679
She was arrested
for not answering a summon.

122
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:53,181
-I said it's not true.
-Damn it.

123
00:07:53,264 --> 00:07:56,434
-Come on!
-This is all a misunderstanding!

124
00:07:56,517 --> 00:07:58,227
-Just shut up!
-Hold on.

125
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,646
-Let me go!
-Who's this pervert?

126
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:03,316
-Stop it!
-Get over here.

127
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:04,650
Get in there already.

128
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:07,904
-Just get in there.
-But…

129
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,155
You've got it all wrong!

130
00:08:13,075 --> 00:08:15,119
No, this isn't what you think.

131
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:19,207
It's not. It really isn't!

132
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,709
It's not. This isn't what you think!

133
00:08:23,002 --> 00:08:26,380
Could there be
a more humiliating first encounter?

134
00:08:29,884 --> 00:08:32,178
Ms. Squid meets Mr. Pervert.

135
00:09:16,681 --> 00:09:19,559
-So how is the horse doing today?
-Absolutely great.

136
00:09:20,184 --> 00:09:22,603
How about the winner gets a wish today?

137
00:09:22,687 --> 00:09:24,689
What kind of crazy are you up to?

138
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:26,399
Win and you'll find out.

139
00:09:27,483 --> 00:09:29,860
-Can you get Andrea ready?
-Sure.

140
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,372
Are you still not ready?
You put the bet in place.

141
00:09:41,455 --> 00:09:43,291
Hold on, will you?

142
00:09:44,625 --> 00:09:46,168
-I'm good.
-Hey.

143
00:09:46,252 --> 00:09:47,837
What?

144
00:09:51,382 --> 00:09:52,883
Get over here.

145
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,262
Damn it.

146
00:10:01,225 --> 00:10:05,146
Up until last month, you roamed overseas
to get your fill of paragliding.

147
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,231
-Are you already fed up with it?
-Dad.

148
00:10:07,315 --> 00:10:09,817
What if I crash land in North Korea
while paragliding?

149
00:10:10,484 --> 00:10:11,527
I'll die.

150
00:10:11,611 --> 00:10:14,113
So you've moved on to horseback riding?

151
00:10:14,196 --> 00:10:17,867
Dad, do you know how it feels like
to ride across the plains on Mimi's back?

152
00:10:18,367 --> 00:10:21,370
It's as if the wind, myself, and Mimi…

153
00:10:22,872 --> 00:10:24,373
have become one.

154
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:27,710
-You ridiculous brat.
-What?

155
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:29,754
You're no Prince Charming.

156
00:10:29,837 --> 00:10:32,089
Don't just yell at me.
Do-yun was out there too.

157
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:35,551
He's earned his break, not like you!

158
00:10:35,635 --> 00:10:36,719
That's hardly the case.

159
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:39,680
Just so you know, I have over 80 licenses.

160
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:43,225
This month, I became
a certified horse trainer.

161
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:46,687
And? Have you earned any money
with those licenses of yours?

162
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,109
I wouldn't nag if you're able to earn
at least a million won a month.

163
00:10:52,193 --> 00:10:53,653
A million won? Seriously?

164
00:10:53,736 --> 00:10:57,490
That much I can earn in a week.
You've got to be kidding me.

165
00:10:58,199 --> 00:10:59,450
Is that so?

166
00:11:00,034 --> 00:11:02,036
-Do-yun, let's make a bet.
-Sure.

167
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:06,165
Would he be able to earn
a million won in a week? Yes or no?

168
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:10,753
Uncle, I…

169
00:11:14,465 --> 00:11:15,883
I bet that he can't--

170
00:11:15,966 --> 00:11:18,594
Do-yun, are you kidding me?
I'm disappointed.

171
00:11:18,677 --> 00:11:20,471
Dad, I'm Han Yu-hyeon.

172
00:11:20,554 --> 00:11:22,515
I end up doing whatever I put my mind to.

173
00:11:23,891 --> 00:11:25,017
Fine.

174
00:11:25,101 --> 00:11:27,686
Then I'll give you a week

175
00:11:27,770 --> 00:11:29,855
for you to earn a million won.

176
00:11:30,439 --> 00:11:34,402
Manage to do so and I won't interfere
with what you do with your life anymore.

177
00:11:34,485 --> 00:11:35,736
Are you sure?

178
00:11:35,820 --> 00:11:38,489
A man shouldn't go back
on his words, okay?

179
00:11:40,991 --> 00:11:43,661
"Scuba diving, paragliding, origami art,

180
00:11:43,744 --> 00:11:46,622
dancesport, pet care, natural dyeing,

181
00:11:46,705 --> 00:11:48,165
teddy bear making…"

182
00:11:48,749 --> 00:11:50,793
"Food carving"?
What kind of a skill is that?

183
00:11:52,795 --> 00:11:53,712
Something like this.

184
00:11:54,630 --> 00:11:56,090
Did you work in nightclubs?

185
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:01,095
No, I learned all these as hobbies.

186
00:12:01,178 --> 00:12:02,304
For fun?

187
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:06,267
You have a number of skills,
but none of them are useful.

188
00:12:06,350 --> 00:12:08,811
The list is long, so keep reading.

189
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:11,230
Here we go.

190
00:12:11,313 --> 00:12:14,316
You can cook Korean, Chinese,
Japanese, and Western cuisine

191
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,318
and are a certified barista.

192
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:18,320
Should I find you a job at a restaurant?

193
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,033
Actually, no.
I'll only be working for a week,

194
00:12:23,117 --> 00:12:25,244
so find me a job that pays a lot.

195
00:12:45,139 --> 00:12:49,143
Sir, you remind me of an eraser.

196
00:12:49,226 --> 00:12:51,687
-There's no end to the skin you shed.
-What?

197
00:12:51,770 --> 00:12:54,106
It's nothing. Now, please flip.

198
00:13:12,166 --> 00:13:14,418
After all that you've said,

199
00:13:14,502 --> 00:13:16,420
you've only earned 28,700 won.

200
00:13:16,504 --> 00:13:19,340
You see, my plan was to
earn 150,000 won a day

201
00:13:19,423 --> 00:13:22,051
-to make a million by the end of the week.
-So?

202
00:13:22,134 --> 00:13:24,929
I scrubbed people's backs
with all the might I had…

203
00:13:25,971 --> 00:13:27,598
and my shoulder popped out.

204
00:13:27,681 --> 00:13:29,475
-And?
-What?

205
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:32,394
That's all you can say
when your son has a dislocated shoulder?

206
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:35,439
-So let's forget about the bet.
-You brat--

207
00:13:35,523 --> 00:13:37,149
Ji-man, please calm down.

208
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:38,567
Enough talking.

209
00:13:38,651 --> 00:13:40,986
You're to get out of this house instantly!

210
00:13:41,695 --> 00:13:42,988
Ji-man, please.

211
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:47,618
He hasn't worked a day in his life
but opted to take on hard labor.

212
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:50,120
You should be proud--

213
00:13:50,204 --> 00:13:51,914
You taking his side all the time

214
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,833
is why he's still a big baby at 30!

215
00:13:54,917 --> 00:13:57,670
What do you mean I take his side?

216
00:13:57,753 --> 00:13:58,963
Don't just stand there.

217
00:13:59,046 --> 00:14:02,341
I clearly told you
that I'd kick you out of this house

218
00:14:03,008 --> 00:14:05,219
if you couldn't make
a million won in a week.

219
00:14:05,302 --> 00:14:08,055
When did you say that? I don't remember.

220
00:14:10,307 --> 00:14:11,475
I knew you'd say that.

221
00:14:17,773 --> 00:14:21,569
Then I'll give you a week
for you to earn a million won.

222
00:14:21,652 --> 00:14:25,739
Manage to do so and I won't interfere
with what you do with your life anymore.

223
00:14:26,323 --> 00:14:27,157
Are you sure?

224
00:14:27,241 --> 00:14:29,785
A man shouldn't go back
on his words, okay?

225
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:35,082
However, if you don't manage
to earn a million won in a week,

226
00:14:35,165 --> 00:14:36,667
I'll kick you out of the house.

227
00:14:37,751 --> 00:14:38,919
You're on.

228
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,129
If I don't earn the money,

229
00:14:40,212 --> 00:14:42,715
I'll leave the house, not wearing
a single underwear you bought me.

230
00:14:42,798 --> 00:14:44,008
Auntie…

231
00:14:44,758 --> 00:14:47,553
Ji-man.
You won't follow through on this, right?

232
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:51,599
Of course not.

233
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:56,312
He's my one and only son after all.

234
00:14:57,271 --> 00:14:59,189
I'll let him keep his underwear.

235
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:03,903
-Dad…
-Take off the damn coat!

236
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:06,113
Dad, why are you being this way?

237
00:15:06,196 --> 00:15:08,449
If it's a midlife crisis,
see a doctor for it.

238
00:15:08,532 --> 00:15:10,242
-You brat!
-Seriously?

239
00:15:10,326 --> 00:15:11,452
Dad, please.

240
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,829
-Get back here.
-Damn it.

241
00:15:13,913 --> 00:15:16,332
Dad, please calm down.

242
00:15:21,211 --> 00:15:23,339
-What the hell?
-Seriously?

243
00:15:24,715 --> 00:15:26,300
Catch me if you can.

244
00:15:27,509 --> 00:15:28,802
I'll never let you back in.

245
00:15:31,889 --> 00:15:33,599
What the hell? Go after him.

246
00:15:33,682 --> 00:15:34,892
Got it.

247
00:15:39,897 --> 00:15:40,814
Damn it.

248
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,069
He'll pay for this.

249
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:48,822
What the hell?

250
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:56,413
Officer, didn't you see
an old man swinging a golf club?

251
00:15:56,497 --> 00:15:59,375
He's trying to kill me
and I need your help.

252
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:02,711
Look here, mister.
Why aren't you wearing any pants?

253
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:06,048
-He stole them!
-Okay, we'll talk at the station.

254
00:16:06,131 --> 00:16:08,717
No, wait.
You should be arresting the old man.

255
00:16:08,801 --> 00:16:11,220
That hurts. You're hurting my shoulder!

256
00:16:12,221 --> 00:16:14,098
Excuse me, officer.

257
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:19,186
This is a huge misunderstanding.
This isn't what it looks like.

258
00:16:19,269 --> 00:16:21,146
Excuse me? Come on, officer.

259
00:16:22,439 --> 00:16:23,857
Hey, you!

260
00:16:33,617 --> 00:16:36,036
It's not what you think.

261
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:38,580
I don't expose myself to girls
in front of the school.

262
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:40,332
I'm not a pervert.

263
00:16:40,416 --> 00:16:44,503
Besides, this is a limited edition coat.
There's only two of this in Korea.

264
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,672
-Would you like to check?
-Please, no.

265
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:49,049
-Here.
-Don't come any closer.

266
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:49,967
But…

267
00:16:51,301 --> 00:16:53,721
That's rich considering
the state you're in.

268
00:16:53,804 --> 00:16:57,182
Still, it's better to be clothed
than naked.

269
00:16:59,143 --> 00:17:00,310
Damn it!

270
00:17:01,061 --> 00:17:03,063
Hey, it's the movie actor Anthony!

271
00:17:31,008 --> 00:17:33,886
Who here goes by the ID, "Poopy Anthony"?

272
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:37,097
We're here for the slander case.

273
00:17:37,681 --> 00:17:38,515
This way, please.

274
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,269
That is a vulgar nickname
to give a person.

275
00:17:44,354 --> 00:17:45,939
Wait. Is he a pervert?

276
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:47,900
I said it's a misunderstanding!

277
00:17:48,776 --> 00:17:51,653
Besides, look who's talking.
You look like a poison dart frog.

278
00:17:51,737 --> 00:17:53,989
Do you have any idea how much this costs?

279
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,325
-Not at all.
-You just don't get it, do you?

280
00:17:56,408 --> 00:17:58,285
That's enough. The both of you.

281
00:17:58,368 --> 00:17:59,453
Please keep it down.

282
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,206
Anyway, the one you're after…

283
00:18:03,040 --> 00:18:04,458
is her.

284
00:18:13,050 --> 00:18:14,802
The giant squid? Hey.

285
00:18:19,932 --> 00:18:23,894
They say you meet your enemies
at the worst place and time.

286
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:29,691
Anthony…

287
00:19:20,075 --> 00:19:21,201
Dong-u!

288
00:19:25,205 --> 00:19:26,415
Run!

289
00:19:27,166 --> 00:19:29,126
Dong-u!

290
00:19:36,884 --> 00:19:38,218
Wake up.

291
00:19:41,054 --> 00:19:42,139
We need a medic!

292
00:19:43,390 --> 00:19:44,725
We need a medic!

293
00:19:47,436 --> 00:19:48,937
Come on. Let's go home.

294
00:19:49,897 --> 00:19:51,982
We promised to go see Mom.

295
00:19:56,236 --> 00:19:57,821
We need a medic!

296
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,951
Isn't this enough?

297
00:20:03,619 --> 00:20:04,703
It's good, right?

298
00:20:05,662 --> 00:20:06,914
-You did great.
-You too.

299
00:20:08,624 --> 00:20:12,127
I told you the actors could get hurt
because of all these pebbles.

300
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,713
I told you we should shoot in the sand.

301
00:20:22,846 --> 00:20:26,266
I wanted to shoot on a cloudy day,
but I don't see a single cloud.

302
00:20:27,184 --> 00:20:28,727
Gosh, it's steaming hot.

303
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:30,729
-Anthony, that was great.
-Yes.

304
00:20:31,980 --> 00:20:34,399
This is what actors do, right?

305
00:20:34,483 --> 00:20:35,442
You're right.

306
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:38,779
-Get this helmet off me.
-Okay.

307
00:20:39,404 --> 00:20:41,907
-You did great.
-Gosh, this is nice and cool.

308
00:20:41,990 --> 00:20:43,533
Wipe my neck.

309
00:20:46,787 --> 00:20:48,330
How was my method acting?

310
00:20:48,413 --> 00:20:50,249
Did you see the sincerity in my eyes?

311
00:20:50,332 --> 00:20:53,543
I almost thought you actually used to be
in special forces.

312
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:55,087
You were great.

313
00:20:55,170 --> 00:20:58,048
It wasn't easy
being a social service agent either.

314
00:20:58,882 --> 00:21:01,551
Anthony, you have no idea how hard
it was to get this.

315
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:02,886
Thank you.

316
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:05,222
How was his acting?

317
00:21:05,305 --> 00:21:08,308
His vocal tone, diction, and breathing
were all amazing.

318
00:21:08,392 --> 00:21:09,559
He was unbelievable.

319
00:21:11,228 --> 00:21:13,647
-It was good, right?
-Yes, you were incredible.

320
00:21:15,732 --> 00:21:16,900
This is nice.

321
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,321
What's this?

322
00:21:23,031 --> 00:21:24,533
Did you put milk in my coffee?

323
00:21:26,201 --> 00:21:27,327
Hey, that latte is mine.

324
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:29,162
Who told you you could drink latte?

325
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:31,331
Americanos are too bitter.

326
00:21:31,415 --> 00:21:32,874
Then have sikhye or misugaru.

327
00:21:32,958 --> 00:21:34,960
Damn it!

328
00:21:35,043 --> 00:21:37,754
I'd better not catch
any of you drinking lattes from now.

329
00:21:38,755 --> 00:21:40,173
-It's here.
-What?

330
00:21:40,257 --> 00:21:41,341
It's here.

331
00:21:43,343 --> 00:21:44,386
Where is the bathroom?

332
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,640
There are no…
This place is a natural reserve.

333
00:21:48,724 --> 00:21:50,934
So we weren't able to build any bathrooms.

334
00:21:51,768 --> 00:21:54,563
-And?
-This place needs to be protected…

335
00:21:54,646 --> 00:21:56,189
I'll dig up a hole!

336
00:21:56,273 --> 00:21:57,232
Are you kidding me?

337
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,988
THE GREAT ACTOR ANTHONY

338
00:22:04,031 --> 00:22:05,282
Anthony, here.

339
00:22:22,174 --> 00:22:23,383
Who's there?

340
00:22:25,761 --> 00:22:27,471
An armed communist guerrilla?

341
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:32,100
Please don't harm me.

342
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:34,019
I won't report you! Don't hurt me!

343
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,355
Hey, what photo did you just take?

344
00:22:38,065 --> 00:22:39,941
Did you take a photo of me taking a dump?

345
00:22:40,025 --> 00:22:42,152
What? Do you think I'm crazy?

346
00:22:42,235 --> 00:22:44,738
Why would I take a photo
of you taking a dump?

347
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:47,532
My goodness.

348
00:22:50,660 --> 00:22:52,537
Are you Anthony, the actor?

349
00:22:53,413 --> 00:22:55,665
Seeing that you followed me
all the way here,

350
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:58,752
-you must be my stalker.
-"A stalker"?

351
00:22:59,503 --> 00:23:02,214
I personally don't like you at all.

352
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,882
You don't like me? Give me that.

353
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:05,884
No, no! Give it back!

354
00:23:05,967 --> 00:23:08,845
-How do you delete the photos?
-That's a film camera.

355
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:10,347
Then give me the film.

356
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:11,932
I didn't take any photos of you!

357
00:23:12,015 --> 00:23:13,934
You're not supposed to open that!

358
00:23:14,017 --> 00:23:15,227
Says who?

359
00:23:19,064 --> 00:23:21,191
Do you expect me to believe you?

360
00:23:23,610 --> 00:23:25,112
What do you think you're doing?

361
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:27,155
That camera is precious to me!

362
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:29,866
That means nothing to me.

363
00:23:29,950 --> 00:23:33,370
Just be grateful
that I won't be suing you.

364
00:23:34,037 --> 00:23:35,747
You're unbelievable.

365
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:38,750
I can't believe you'd take
a photo of me taking a dump.

366
00:24:01,565 --> 00:24:02,607
Dad.

367
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,783
Anthony is the main character?

368
00:24:11,867 --> 00:24:13,702
I bet 500 won and my testicle…

369
00:24:13,785 --> 00:24:16,204
-that this movie…
-"That this movie is going to fail."

370
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:21,877
Why did you write this
when you don't even have testicles?

371
00:24:23,420 --> 00:24:25,338
So he won't know if I'm a man or a woman.

372
00:24:25,422 --> 00:24:27,215
You tried to play smart.

373
00:24:27,799 --> 00:24:30,218
I'm not going to settle.
I want her punished by law.

374
00:24:30,302 --> 00:24:32,512
We can't forgive her.
She has no testicles.

375
00:24:32,596 --> 00:24:35,348
Don't you know malicious comments
are a big issue these days?

376
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:37,893
Okay, I'm sorry.

377
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:41,354
I tried calling his agency,
and I even sent direct messages.

378
00:24:42,063 --> 00:24:43,565
But he never apologized.

379
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,610
Why do I need to apologize?
You should be the one apologizing.

380
00:24:46,693 --> 00:24:48,695
Let's be honest. I was pretty upset too.

381
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,988
Why would you be upset?

382
00:24:50,071 --> 00:24:52,490
You broke my dad's camera,

383
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,993
and you accused me
for having taken a weird photo.

384
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,788
What? A weird photo? What kind of photo?

385
00:25:05,629 --> 00:25:08,340
Anthony was hiding in the mountain

386
00:25:09,716 --> 00:25:11,801
-and taking a…
-I'd like to settle.

387
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:15,430
-We'll settle.
-We'll settle.

388
00:25:18,975 --> 00:25:21,353
You did the right thing! You really did!

389
00:25:21,436 --> 00:25:23,355
-You did great.
-I'll tell the press

390
00:25:23,438 --> 00:25:26,775
to write an article
saying you forgave a cyberbully.

391
00:25:26,858 --> 00:25:30,153
He's right. There was an actor
who got rid of all his haters

392
00:25:30,237 --> 00:25:32,155
by doing volunteer work with cyberbullies.

393
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:33,156
Exactly.

394
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,700
Really? Then let me do the same.

395
00:25:36,910 --> 00:25:39,287
Volunteer work with
the generous actor, Anthony.

396
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:43,458
-But you've never done volunteer work.
-I'll put on an act. I'm an actor.

397
00:25:47,337 --> 00:25:49,047
LETTER OF APOLOGY

398
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,883
You're an adult.

399
00:25:51,967 --> 00:25:53,885
You should be grateful it ended here.

400
00:25:54,761 --> 00:25:56,846
-I'm sorry.
-You may go now.

401
00:25:59,474 --> 00:26:00,392
Hey.

402
00:26:02,727 --> 00:26:03,812
What?

403
00:26:04,562 --> 00:26:06,564
If it's okay with you,

404
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:08,483
can you give me that?

405
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:10,360
Give you what?

406
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,903
You will meet an important person
who will turn your life around.

407
00:26:54,487 --> 00:26:57,699
Whatever happens,
don't let go of that person.

408
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,743
I'm going to meet an important person?

409
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:03,371
But I met a horrible customer, a pervert,

410
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,332
and that annoying actor.

411
00:27:06,166 --> 00:27:07,667
What a punch in the face.

412
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:20,055
-Hey, Ha-yeong.
-Are you on your way?

413
00:27:20,138 --> 00:27:22,182
-It's at 6:00 p.m., right?
-What is?

414
00:27:24,434 --> 00:27:26,603
I told you numerous times
about your blind date.

415
00:27:27,479 --> 00:27:30,732
Well… Ha-yeong, you see…

416
00:27:31,483 --> 00:27:34,402
I still have some work to do.

417
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,321
Can I take a rain check?

418
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,449
Hey! I told you that this guy is

419
00:27:39,532 --> 00:27:41,409
the building owner's son.

420
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:43,620
Please don't embarrass me.

421
00:27:43,703 --> 00:27:47,457
But Ha-yeong,
I have a really important appointment.

422
00:27:56,508 --> 00:27:58,426
"You will meet an important person.

423
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:03,264
Whatever happens,
don't let go of that person."

424
00:28:03,348 --> 00:28:05,350
LUCKY COLOR: SKY BLUE

425
00:28:05,433 --> 00:28:06,726
"Don't let go."

426
00:28:22,909 --> 00:28:24,411
Is she supposed to be a squid?

427
00:28:38,967 --> 00:28:40,009
Here you go.

428
00:28:41,678 --> 00:28:44,472
You're done now. He can go.

429
00:28:45,348 --> 00:28:46,307
Thank you.

430
00:28:54,315 --> 00:28:56,693
-Yu-hyeon?
-Yes?

431
00:28:57,318 --> 00:28:59,571
Why are you wearing that?

432
00:29:00,321 --> 00:29:04,033
Ji-eun, let's say you're at
a public bathhouse and a fire breaks out,

433
00:29:04,117 --> 00:29:06,745
and you can only hide one area
of your entire body.

434
00:29:06,828 --> 00:29:08,538
Which part would you have to hide?

435
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:13,585
My goodness. I don't know.

436
00:29:17,172 --> 00:29:18,298
Your face.

437
00:29:19,340 --> 00:29:21,301
My face? Yes, you're right.

438
00:29:21,801 --> 00:29:24,053
Yu-hyeon, this way.

439
00:29:24,137 --> 00:29:25,472
Keep walking straight.

440
00:29:29,726 --> 00:29:33,021
Let's go to the department store
and get you some clothes.

441
00:29:33,104 --> 00:29:36,483
Nice. They told me
they're getting new products today.

442
00:29:36,566 --> 00:29:38,693
Ji-eun, what's the limit on this?

443
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,654
Do-yun was sorry he couldn't come,
and he gave you that card.

444
00:29:42,238 --> 00:29:43,990
It's not mine, so go splurge.

445
00:29:44,073 --> 00:29:46,951
You're so down-to-earth. You're an angel.

446
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:49,621
By the way,

447
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:54,918
you should apologize
to the chairman this time.

448
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,170
I think he's really angry.

449
00:29:57,253 --> 00:30:00,673
Why do I need to apologize?
Do-yun went there too.

450
00:30:01,424 --> 00:30:02,717
Why is he only angry at me?

451
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:04,928
Then what do you plan to do?

452
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:07,180
I don't know.

453
00:30:07,263 --> 00:30:10,642
I'll book myself a hotel
and think about it there.

454
00:30:20,693 --> 00:30:23,071
My lucky color. "Sky blue."

455
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,032
How much is this?

456
00:30:26,950 --> 00:30:28,493
It's 199,000 won.

457
00:30:32,372 --> 00:30:34,457
Can I get a refund if it doesn't fit?

458
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,358
Yu-hyeon, take this.

459
00:31:00,441 --> 00:31:03,319
Forget it. It still hurts a little,
but I can't be bothered.

460
00:31:04,487 --> 00:31:08,324
But still, take care of your body,
and don't skip any meals.

461
00:31:09,284 --> 00:31:10,827
Thanks, Ji-eun.

462
00:31:16,291 --> 00:31:17,375
Are you here alone?

463
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:19,085
I'll take you to your seat.

464
00:31:22,505 --> 00:31:23,882
This way.

465
00:31:28,511 --> 00:31:29,804
Hey, you're the squid lady.

466
00:31:30,930 --> 00:31:32,307
I almost didn't recognize you.

467
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:36,561
You seem different yourself
now that you're wearing pants.

468
00:31:38,229 --> 00:31:39,439
Ms. Bahn Ha-ni?

469
00:31:44,235 --> 00:31:45,278
I'm sorry I'm late.

470
00:31:46,321 --> 00:31:48,865
I'm Jeong Jun-su.
Doctor Bahn Ha-yeong set us up.

471
00:31:50,325 --> 00:31:51,326
Hello.

472
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:05,506
So you're working at Joa Confectionery
as a contract worker,

473
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:08,217
not a full-time employee?

474
00:32:08,301 --> 00:32:09,886
Well, yes.

475
00:32:09,969 --> 00:32:12,555
Considering your age,
I'm sure you have some savings.

476
00:32:14,933 --> 00:32:18,311
Well, you see,
they don't pay me that much.

477
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:20,229
Oh, I see.

478
00:32:21,898 --> 00:32:24,317
To be honest, I begged your sister

479
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:25,735
to set us up on a date.

480
00:32:26,778 --> 00:32:28,863
You did? Why?

481
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:31,449
I saw the photo she had of you.

482
00:32:31,532 --> 00:32:34,994
But you look nothing like the photos.

483
00:32:36,287 --> 00:32:37,830
Oh, well…

484
00:32:38,373 --> 00:32:41,334
The camera apps these days
make you look nicer than you seem.

485
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:51,219
Now that I take a close look at you,

486
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:52,762
you remind me of a poem.

487
00:32:53,805 --> 00:32:56,391
-Do you know the poem called Four Seasons?
-Oh, yes.

488
00:32:57,058 --> 00:32:59,727
A bed full of red and yellow flowers

489
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:02,855
People think it's a song sung by Turtles.

490
00:33:02,939 --> 00:33:06,192
But I have to say,
the original version is the best one.

491
00:33:06,275 --> 00:33:09,612
I was talking about Four Seasons
by Kang Hyeon-uk, the poet.

492
00:33:14,033 --> 00:33:15,326
I see.

493
00:33:15,410 --> 00:33:19,372
I don't know much about literature.

494
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,624
It's okay if you don't know.

495
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,171
"In springtime,
you were like cherry blossoms.

496
00:33:30,049 --> 00:33:33,344
In the summer,
you were like the cool breeze.

497
00:33:35,430 --> 00:33:38,307
During fall, you were like the sky.

498
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,105
And during winter, you were like
the white snow.

499
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:50,403
You were happiness in and of itself."

500
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:57,910
What a beautiful poem.

501
00:33:58,536 --> 00:34:00,329
No matter how beautiful it may be,

502
00:34:00,413 --> 00:34:03,291
it can't be more beautiful
than our time together.

503
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,462
Jun-su.

504
00:34:07,545 --> 00:34:09,505
While you enjoy the poem I recited,

505
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:13,468
is it okay if I go to the men's room?

506
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:14,886
Sure.

507
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:18,556
I haven't met someone so beautiful
in a long time, so I'm nervous.

508
00:34:23,728 --> 00:34:27,273
You know what?
He's a warm-hearted guy who loves poems.

509
00:34:28,775 --> 00:34:30,193
I should try dating him.

510
00:34:31,861 --> 00:34:35,740
He might really be the important person
that I was destined to meet today.

511
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,884
What's taking him so long?

512
00:34:57,512 --> 00:34:59,222
I wonder if something happened.

513
00:35:02,725 --> 00:35:05,436

INCOMING CALL

517
00:35:15,404 --> 00:35:16,656
Hello?

518
00:35:16,739 --> 00:35:19,325
Ha-ni, did you get the money?

519
00:35:19,408 --> 00:35:20,409
Oh, yes.

520
00:35:21,160 --> 00:35:24,956
But why aren't you coming?
And why did you send me money?

521
00:35:25,039 --> 00:35:27,125
It's for the food I had today.

522
00:35:27,208 --> 00:35:29,752
You can use that to pay for the meal
we had today.

523
00:35:30,336 --> 00:35:33,881
Sometimes, it's better to leave
the beautiful moments behind you.

524
00:35:35,049 --> 00:35:37,885
And I think that's what we should do.

525
00:35:37,969 --> 00:35:40,304
I had fun. Farewell.

526
00:35:41,180 --> 00:35:43,099
Hello? Hello…

527
00:35:47,728 --> 00:35:49,856
What a crazy jerk.

528
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:52,150
Why did he act like a gentleman

529
00:35:52,650 --> 00:35:54,861
if he was going to reject me like this?

530
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:39,405
I had no dreams, goals, or hope.

531
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,533
What did I even expect?

532
00:36:45,036 --> 00:36:47,288
I was never happy with my life.

533
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:50,708
But this day, the scar in my heart
didn't fade very easily

534
00:36:52,710 --> 00:36:56,214
just like the stain on my jacket.

535
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,108
Sir.

536
00:37:17,568 --> 00:37:19,153
I'm afraid this card is…

537
00:37:19,237 --> 00:37:20,112
What's wrong?

538
00:37:20,196 --> 00:37:22,657
It has been reported stolen and is frozen.

539
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:28,913
YU-HYEON

540
00:37:28,996 --> 00:37:30,456
Pick up.

541
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:33,918
Pick up.

542
00:37:34,001 --> 00:37:36,420
-The number you have dialed…
-Damn it.

543
00:37:39,215 --> 00:37:41,550
BROTHER

544
00:37:43,386 --> 00:37:44,929
The number you have dialed…

545
00:37:46,931 --> 00:37:48,391
MY DEAR YU-HYEON

546
00:37:53,229 --> 00:37:54,230
Please…

547
00:37:55,064 --> 00:37:57,108
Please…

548
00:38:00,736 --> 00:38:02,571
Take heed of what I'm about to say.

549
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:04,156
Do not pick up his calls.

550
00:38:04,740 --> 00:38:07,994
If you do, I will kick you out. I mean it.

551
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:10,079
Especially you, Do-yun.

552
00:38:10,705 --> 00:38:14,250
Do not give him a single penny.

553
00:38:14,917 --> 00:38:16,669
Okay. I'm sorry.

554
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:20,840
Ji-man, why are you doing this
to Yu-hyeon?

555
00:38:20,923 --> 00:38:24,760
Must you do this to your poor boy
who lost his mom at a young age?

556
00:38:25,594 --> 00:38:27,930
That's exactly why I pampered him.

557
00:38:28,014 --> 00:38:30,224
And now, he still hasn't matured.

558
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:32,518
Let me repeat myself.

559
00:38:32,601 --> 00:38:34,645
You better not help him out.

560
00:38:46,991 --> 00:38:49,618
What's gotten into him?

561
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,705
Ji-eun, did Yu-hyeon tell you
anything in particular?

562
00:38:54,373 --> 00:38:58,210
No. He just said he was going
to let off steam.

563
00:38:58,919 --> 00:39:00,963
He seemed pretty laid back.

564
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:06,427
What should we do with him?

565
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:08,054
He must be panicking right now.

566
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:12,767
I bought this brand new pair today.

567
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:15,561
There are only two pairs of these
in this entire country.

568
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:23,277
-Is this the police--
-Hold on.

569
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,613
Come on. Damn it.

570
00:39:25,696 --> 00:39:26,864
Excuse me.

571
00:39:30,242 --> 00:39:33,954
You see, I'm in a pickle right now.

572
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,874
Could you lend me some money?

573
00:39:37,666 --> 00:39:38,501
I'm sorry?

574
00:39:38,584 --> 00:39:41,879
You were my cellmate.
We should help each other out.

575
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,716
A cellmate? What are you on about?

576
00:39:45,800 --> 00:39:48,135
Fine. I'll pay you twofold tomorrow.

577
00:39:48,219 --> 00:39:50,096
No. I'll pay you threefold.

578
00:39:50,179 --> 00:39:54,266
Forget it. How could I possibly trust
a pervert?

579
00:39:57,019 --> 00:39:58,771
Today's such a shitty day.

580
00:40:09,532 --> 00:40:12,410
I'll pay tenfold.

581
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:15,079
So help me put an end to this.

582
00:40:19,041 --> 00:40:20,292
Please.

583
00:40:44,650 --> 00:40:46,318
Give me your number.

584
00:40:48,779 --> 00:40:49,780
Thank you.

585
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:52,450
I will repay your kindness no matter what.

586
00:40:53,492 --> 00:40:54,869
Forget about that.

587
00:40:55,619 --> 00:40:58,497
I'll tell you my bank account number,
so just pay me back.

588
00:40:59,748 --> 00:41:00,875
1.4 million won.

589
00:41:20,060 --> 00:41:21,770
You're despicable.

590
00:41:22,563 --> 00:41:24,398
You're nothing but a pooper.

591
00:41:24,982 --> 00:41:26,400
Look at you posing.

592
00:41:46,086 --> 00:41:47,838
That looks refreshing.

593
00:41:50,007 --> 00:41:51,258
Hi again.

594
00:41:51,342 --> 00:41:54,386
-Are you following me?
-I was here first.

595
00:42:14,823 --> 00:42:17,451
Whenever I'm struggling in life,

596
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,455
there are various ways
for me to find comfort.

597
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,834
Softhearted words, a warm shower,

598
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:27,920
a refreshing beer…

599
00:42:28,629 --> 00:42:32,174
And this may sound cruel,

600
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,094
but watching someone else

601
00:42:35,678 --> 00:42:36,929
who's more pitiful than me.

602
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:53,237
Why are you giving them to me?

603
00:42:53,821 --> 00:42:54,697
Just because.

604
00:42:55,739 --> 00:42:57,324
I'll pay you back.

605
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,536
Forget it.
Don't worry about it and just have them.

606
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:10,963
STORE MANAGER

607
00:43:16,468 --> 00:43:18,554
-Hello, sir.
-Ha-ni, what…

608
00:43:19,221 --> 00:43:21,140
What the hell happened?

609
00:43:21,223 --> 00:43:23,058
I'm truly sorry.

610
00:43:23,142 --> 00:43:26,020
I've been out of it.

611
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,897
I'll stop by the hospital tomorrow.

612
00:43:28,981 --> 00:43:30,816
I'll kneel in front--

613
00:43:30,899 --> 00:43:32,359
Forget it. It's done for.

614
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:34,695
Look at the posts online right now!

615
00:43:42,578 --> 00:43:44,705
SQUID-GOOD INCIDENT
JOA CONFECTIONERY

616
00:43:44,788 --> 00:43:47,124
O MART HAS FINALLY DONE IT

617
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,294
ATTITUDE OF SQUID-GOOD EMPLOYEE

618
00:43:50,377 --> 00:43:54,173
MY SON ALMOST DIED AFTER EATING
SQUID-GOOD FROM JOA CONFECTIONERY

619
00:43:55,341 --> 00:43:56,216
What should I do?

620
00:43:56,925 --> 00:43:58,302
O MART HAS ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS

621
00:43:58,385 --> 00:43:59,928
I DON'T EVEN LIKE THEIR NAME

622
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:02,640
THE EMPLOYEE JUST VANISHED
AMIDST THE COMMOTION

623
00:44:02,723 --> 00:44:04,642
Why did it blow up so much?

624
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:08,604
What did I do so wrong?

625
00:45:00,948 --> 00:45:02,074
Strangely enough

626
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:05,202
at that moment,

627
00:45:05,994 --> 00:45:07,955
I wasn't afraid of dying.

628
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:12,668
Because my dream,

629
00:45:13,210 --> 00:45:14,711
my bright future,

630
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:17,923
and my radiant life…

631
00:45:20,968 --> 00:45:22,428
had all disappeared…

632
00:45:26,432 --> 00:45:27,724
ever since that day…

633
00:45:31,854 --> 00:45:32,855
twenty years ago.

634
00:45:37,443 --> 00:45:41,113
-Young Power! Open Your Heart!
-Open Your Heart!

635
00:45:41,196 --> 00:45:42,573
HOSU HIGH SCHOOL

636
00:45:42,656 --> 00:45:43,490
20 YEARS AGO

637
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,200
Hello, I'm Rocky, your host.

638
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:49,079
Today, I'm at Hosu High School in Seoul.

639
00:45:49,163 --> 00:45:53,375
Today, you will be able
to open your heart.

640
00:45:53,459 --> 00:45:55,752
Let's bring in our first student.

641
00:45:58,297 --> 00:46:01,467
I came here to confess my love.

642
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:03,260
-Ha-ni!
-Bahn Ha-ni!

643
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:04,761
-Bahn Ha-ni!
-I was amazed

644
00:46:04,845 --> 00:46:08,307
by how well you danced
during our school festival.

645
00:46:08,390 --> 00:46:09,808
I want to be your friend.

646
00:46:09,892 --> 00:46:11,727
You'll be a great singer.

647
00:46:11,810 --> 00:46:13,270
I'll be your manager.

648
00:46:13,353 --> 00:46:14,730
Bahn Ha-ni from 10th grade, class 3.

649
00:46:14,813 --> 00:46:16,565
I love you! Be my girlfriend!

650
00:46:16,648 --> 00:46:18,150
Can you see my heart?

651
00:46:21,695 --> 00:46:25,365
Let's give a round of applause
for Bahn Ha-ni.

652
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,534
You too?

653
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:29,286
BAHN HA-NI

654
00:46:29,369 --> 00:46:31,121
Hosu High School's Lee Hyo-ri!

655
00:46:31,205 --> 00:46:33,332
-Bahn Ha-ni is the best!
-Bahn Ha-ni is the best!

656
00:46:33,415 --> 00:46:35,083
-We're in love with you!
-We're in love with you!

657
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:36,793
-We love you, Ha-ni!
-We love you, Ha-ni!

658
00:46:36,877 --> 00:46:38,670
-Hosu High School's Lee Hyo-ri!
-Hosu High School's Lee Hyo-ri!

659
00:46:38,754 --> 00:46:41,840
-Bahn Ha-ni is the best!
-Who in the world is she?

660
00:46:41,924 --> 00:46:43,675
-We love you, Ha-ni!
-We love you, Ha-ni!

661
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:47,054
Ha-ni, they're all calling for you.

662
00:46:47,137 --> 00:46:48,430
Shouldn't you go outside?

663
00:46:48,514 --> 00:46:49,640
Let them be.

664
00:46:50,557 --> 00:46:54,186
The star should always appear
at the last moment.

665
00:47:21,129 --> 00:47:23,257
Captain, we brought her.

666
00:47:23,966 --> 00:47:25,926
Hey! Treat her with care!

667
00:47:28,387 --> 00:47:32,766
My apologies. I told them to escort you,
but these idiots didn't know better.

668
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:35,727
Wait!

669
00:47:35,811 --> 00:47:36,895
Don't do anything.

670
00:47:37,896 --> 00:47:40,315
I won't be able to tell you this
once I see your face.

671
00:47:43,026 --> 00:47:47,030
I mean, after what happened
at the snack stand recently…

672
00:47:48,574 --> 00:47:51,827
Anyway, stop playing hard to get
and be my girlfriend already.

673
00:47:51,910 --> 00:47:54,454
Being the girlfriend
of Captain Yang Chun-sik

674
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:56,748
from Hosu High School
would be grand, right?

675
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,676
Ha-ni, why won't you answer me?

676
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:20,814
I'm sorry. It's me. Oh Ji-eun.

677
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:23,692
You idiots.

678
00:48:24,443 --> 00:48:28,530
I told you to bring Ha-ni,
not her little minion! Damn it!

679
00:48:28,614 --> 00:48:30,782
Who are you calling a minion, you idiot?

680
00:48:58,310 --> 00:49:00,562
-Chun-sik, are you okay?
-Are you okay?

681
00:49:00,646 --> 00:49:02,230
Ji-eun, are you all right?

682
00:49:02,314 --> 00:49:03,815
-Yes.
-Wake up.

683
00:49:03,899 --> 00:49:06,151
Hey. Damn it.

684
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:07,694
-What should I do?
-Hey.

685
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:11,615
If you call her a minion one more time,

686
00:49:11,698 --> 00:49:13,700
I will make you pay!

687
00:49:18,580 --> 00:49:20,832
Those good-for-nothing jerks.

688
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:21,958
Ha-ni's here.

689
00:49:47,025 --> 00:49:50,654
All right. The beauty queen
of Hosu High School,

690
00:49:50,737 --> 00:49:52,781
Bahn Ha-ni, is here with us.

691
00:49:52,864 --> 00:49:54,783
No wonder they love you.

692
00:49:54,866 --> 00:49:56,535
You're full of charms.

693
00:49:57,035 --> 00:49:59,121
YOUNG POWER, OPEN YOUR HEART

694
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:03,917
Okay. I think we need to hear this.

695
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,796
Do you like anyone here at this school?

696
00:50:09,756 --> 00:50:11,174
Well…

697
00:50:12,926 --> 00:50:14,302
Yes, I do.

698
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:16,596
She does. Let's find out who it is.

699
00:50:19,891 --> 00:50:22,018
My crush is…

700
00:50:27,315 --> 00:50:28,191
Ha-ni!

701
00:50:28,775 --> 00:50:30,819
Say that it's me! Say it!

702
00:50:32,154 --> 00:50:33,488
Bahn

703
00:50:34,156 --> 00:50:35,449
Ha…

704
00:50:36,867 --> 00:50:37,826
Ni!

705
00:50:42,998 --> 00:50:45,417
You charm everyone around you

706
00:50:45,500 --> 00:50:48,086
and make them
fall in love with you, Ha-ni.

707
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:51,131
I love you! You are…

708
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:53,508
the best!

709
00:51:17,491 --> 00:51:18,325
Ha-ni.

710
00:51:25,207 --> 00:51:26,374
Bahn Ha-ni.

711
00:51:27,542 --> 00:51:29,878
Gosh, that girl.

712
00:51:34,674 --> 00:51:36,676
-Didn't you hear me call?
-I was practicing.

713
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,845
No. Quit this nonsense.

714
00:51:38,929 --> 00:51:40,847
Go to Hyeongje Mart
and buy some scallions.

715
00:51:41,723 --> 00:51:43,725
Tell Ha-yeong to do it.

716
00:51:43,809 --> 00:51:45,602
Why am I always doing errands?

717
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,687
Don't talk like that about your sister.

718
00:51:47,771 --> 00:51:49,981
She's a senior in high school.

719
00:51:50,065 --> 00:51:52,484
Dad and Grandma are almost here, so hurry.

720
00:51:53,151 --> 00:51:54,986
I'm going to buy snacks with the change.

721
00:51:55,070 --> 00:51:58,490
Hey. We're about to have dinner.
Don't be absurd.

722
00:51:59,282 --> 00:52:01,910
Gosh, that girl and her snacks.

723
00:52:05,664 --> 00:52:08,542
Sir, how much are these scallions?

724
00:52:12,128 --> 00:52:13,463
What are you doing?

725
00:52:13,547 --> 00:52:16,842
We're breaking the world record
for the longest hug while doing a split.

726
00:52:16,925 --> 00:52:18,802
Get the change yourself and go.

727
00:52:18,885 --> 00:52:22,180
Don't talk. I'm about to burst
at the slightest movement.

728
00:52:23,139 --> 00:52:24,307
Okay. 180 degrees, now.

729
00:52:27,519 --> 00:52:29,020
I want this too. How much?

730
00:52:29,104 --> 00:52:31,481
A bundle of scallions and that snack
cost 750 won.

731
00:52:31,565 --> 00:52:34,109
Make it 1,000-won.
We can't give you any change now.

732
00:52:34,192 --> 00:52:35,694
I said, be quiet.

733
00:52:35,777 --> 00:52:38,780
I'm multitasking.
This is what a true challenger does.

734
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:42,033
Again. 180 degrees!

735
00:52:43,535 --> 00:52:47,122
HYEONGJE MART

736
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:49,749
Dad!

737
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,131
Stop taking photos.

738
00:52:56,214 --> 00:52:57,549
Get in.

739
00:52:59,301 --> 00:53:02,053
-Dad, promise me one thing.
-Yes?

740
00:53:02,137 --> 00:53:04,431
-What is it?
-Promise me first.

741
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,601
-Fine.
-Promise,

742
00:53:07,684 --> 00:53:09,060
copied, signed,

743
00:53:09,144 --> 00:53:10,770
and laminated.

744
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:13,815
You have my word, so tell me.

745
00:53:14,733 --> 00:53:18,862
When Mom tries
to beat me to a pulp tomorrow,

746
00:53:18,945 --> 00:53:20,780
promise me you'll be by my side.

747
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:23,116
Why would she do that in the first place?

748
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:26,661
Because I'll be doing something
that calls for it.

749
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,038
Which is?

750
00:53:28,121 --> 00:53:30,707
You'll eventually find out tomorrow,

751
00:53:30,790 --> 00:53:34,294
so don't tell her about our promise. Okay?

752
00:53:34,920 --> 00:53:37,589
You're not doing anything illegal,
are you?

753
00:53:38,632 --> 00:53:41,509
Come on, Dad. I'm your daughter.

754
00:53:42,636 --> 00:53:45,263
All right. You always have my trust.

755
00:53:46,765 --> 00:53:48,892
Side with me tomorrow,

756
00:53:48,975 --> 00:53:52,062
and I'll promise you
a lavish lifestyle forever.

757
00:53:56,149 --> 00:53:58,109
-Here.
-What? What is this?

758
00:54:03,865 --> 00:54:06,826
Don't tell her about this either.

759
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,582
It'll be our little secret.

760
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:36,564
How do I look?

761
00:54:37,941 --> 00:54:38,942
Don't I look ill?

762
00:54:39,526 --> 00:54:41,528
No, you just look terrifying.

763
00:54:42,696 --> 00:54:44,406
How can I get out of here early?

764
00:54:46,157 --> 00:54:49,619
If I skip school,
they'll call my mom immediately.

765
00:54:59,671 --> 00:55:02,048
You know I'm lactose-intolerant.

766
00:55:02,132 --> 00:55:04,300
You said you could give your life for me.

767
00:55:04,384 --> 00:55:05,677
Was it a lie?

768
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:07,137
No.

769
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:09,597
If I drink this,

770
00:55:10,181 --> 00:55:12,142
does that mean we're dating?

771
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:13,893
Of course.

772
00:55:17,230 --> 00:55:18,606
Sure, I can drink this.

773
00:55:25,488 --> 00:55:28,283
Ma'am, Chun-sik isn't doing well.

774
00:55:28,366 --> 00:55:30,410
I think I should take him to a hospital.

775
00:55:32,245 --> 00:55:35,206
First, take him to the nurse's office.

776
00:55:36,916 --> 00:55:40,086
Gosh! Chun-sik, are you okay?

777
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,172
You're breaking into a cold sweat.

778
00:55:42,255 --> 00:55:45,508
Ma'am, I think it's best
we take him to a hospital.

779
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:47,469
I'll take him.

780
00:55:51,431 --> 00:55:53,558
We're going out starting today.

781
00:55:54,517 --> 00:55:56,227
I know.

782
00:55:57,771 --> 00:56:00,106
What should we do?
Do you want to go watch a movie?

783
00:56:05,111 --> 00:56:06,696
I think you should go

784
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,865
to the toilet first.

785
00:56:08,948 --> 00:56:12,494
I'll finish in ten seconds.

786
00:56:34,474 --> 00:56:36,518
MY LOVE HA-NI

787
00:56:36,601 --> 00:56:39,813
Chun-sik, let's break up.

788
00:56:40,688 --> 00:56:43,691
Have a great time with the toilet.

789
00:56:43,775 --> 00:56:45,110
Bye!

790
00:56:45,193 --> 00:56:48,238
Ha-ni! You'll pay for this!

791
00:56:58,748 --> 00:57:01,042
IT'S YOUR TURN TO BE THE NEW FIN.K.L.

792
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:23,148

793
00:57:23,231 --> 00:57:24,482
She really is something.

794
00:57:25,233 --> 00:57:26,401
She has potential.

795
00:57:49,966 --> 00:57:51,092
Bahn Ha-ni.

796
00:58:05,732 --> 00:58:07,567
I told you to cut that nonsense.

797
00:58:07,650 --> 00:58:09,777
You've ruined everything.

798
00:58:11,321 --> 00:58:13,239
It was an important audition.

799
00:58:13,323 --> 00:58:14,574
I don't care.

800
00:58:14,657 --> 00:58:17,535
How dare you skip school? My gosh.

801
00:58:17,619 --> 00:58:20,622
Why does she become more defiant
as time goes by?

802
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:23,124
That's enough. You too, Ha-ni.

803
00:58:24,042 --> 00:58:26,628
I told you I wanted to become a singer!

804
00:58:26,711 --> 00:58:29,422
Do you want me to break your legs?

805
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,007
We'll talk at home.

806
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:32,717
No, we won't.

807
00:58:32,800 --> 00:58:34,344
I'm going to audition again.

808
00:58:34,844 --> 00:58:35,845
Gosh.

809
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,361
-Gosh, she must be insane.
-What?

810
00:58:51,444 --> 00:58:53,613
No. Let me.

811
00:58:58,284 --> 00:58:59,118
Ha-ni!

812
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,872
Wait up! Let's talk!

813
00:59:03,581 --> 00:59:05,250
Ha-ni, wait up!

814
00:59:06,042 --> 00:59:08,711
Don't stop me. I'm going to audition.

815
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:12,507
You promised to back me up yesterday!

816
00:59:15,009 --> 00:59:16,010
Ha-ni, watch out!

817
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,571
It can't be.

818
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:37,865
Am I going to die?

819
00:59:40,326 --> 00:59:41,995
What about my radiant dream?

820
00:59:43,121 --> 00:59:44,664
My promising future?

821
00:59:45,832 --> 00:59:47,375
What will happen to them?

822
01:00:18,239 --> 01:00:19,240
Are you okay?

823
01:00:26,205 --> 01:00:27,206
Is this…

824
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,251
a hospital?

825
01:00:30,335 --> 01:00:32,754
Yes. You were in an accident last night.

826
01:00:34,922 --> 01:00:35,840
An accident?

827
01:00:36,341 --> 01:00:38,635
Yes. You were in a critical state,

828
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:41,304
so we got a CT scan and an ECG.

829
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,264
Fortunately, you're okay.

830
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:46,434
Oh, I see.

831
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:47,935
What's your name?

832
01:00:48,436 --> 01:00:49,312
Bahn Ha-ni.

833
01:00:53,650 --> 01:00:55,693
It's Bahn Ha-ni.

834
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:56,778
Okay.

835
01:00:57,362 --> 01:00:59,238
When is your birthday?

836
01:00:59,822 --> 01:01:02,075
-November 18, 1984.
-November 18, 1984.

837
01:01:02,867 --> 01:01:06,871
Hey, kid. Aren't you too young
to be born in 1984?

838
01:01:06,954 --> 01:01:08,081
I'm 17 years old.

839
01:01:08,164 --> 01:01:10,625
Then you weren't born in that year.

840
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:13,044
Tell me your guardian's name.

841
01:01:13,711 --> 01:01:15,088
Bahn Gi-tae.

01:01:16,589 --> 01:01:17,632
What's his number?

843
01:01:17,715 --> 01:01:20,343
It's 018-458-1128.

844
01:01:21,344 --> 01:01:23,054
No one uses "018" these days.

845
01:01:23,137 --> 01:01:25,973
Why not? Mine also starts
with those digits.

846
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,496
Are you…

847
01:01:49,080 --> 01:01:50,164
You…

848
01:01:52,333 --> 01:01:53,710
You can't be…

849
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:57,213
Are you…

850
01:01:57,922 --> 01:02:00,967
Do you know me, ma'am?

BAHN HA-NI

852
01:02:11,602 --> 01:02:15,398

to give up on everything,

01:02:15,481 --> 01:02:17,400
on the year I turned 37…

854
01:02:18,818 --> 01:02:21,529
you came to me.

855
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,533
The most obnoxious girl in the world.

HOW SHOULD I BEGIN?

863

"Twenty years in the future?

864
01:03:29,388 --> 01:03:31,557
Just thinking about it is terrifying.

865
01:03:32,058 --> 01:03:34,560
How old would I look at the age of 37?

866
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:36,604
I can't imagine myself,

867
01:03:37,396 --> 01:03:39,315
but I can guarantee one thing.

868
01:03:40,107 --> 01:03:44,487
Even 20 years from now,
you'll still be amazing, confident,

869
01:03:44,570 --> 01:03:47,406
and be loved by everyone around you.

01:03:54,664 --> 01:03:55,957
come true?"

What are you doing here?

874
01:04:06,467 --> 01:04:08,177
How can my 17-year-old self be here?

875
01:04:08,928 --> 01:04:10,346
You just don't get it, do you?

876
01:04:11,222 --> 01:04:13,182
Don't you dare set foot in here again!

877
01:04:13,266 --> 01:04:15,059
There must be a conspiracy.

878
01:04:15,142 --> 01:04:17,520
Call the writer and say
I want to meet in person.

879
