EPISODE 13

2
00:00:53,803 --> 00:00:55,597
I had a blast today.

3
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:58,641
We took a nice trip
and had loads of delicious food.

4
00:00:59,225 --> 00:01:01,436
I'm happy that you had a great time.

5
00:01:11,112 --> 00:01:12,238
Mom?

6
00:01:14,741 --> 00:01:15,909
Who is she?

7
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:20,705
-Well--
-Who is she?

8
00:01:23,041 --> 00:01:24,626
-But…
-Move.

9
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:28,046
Why is she living with you
when she should've returned to the States?

10
00:01:28,630 --> 00:01:30,715
Mom, you see--

11
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,926
Who are you? Tell me who you are.

12
00:01:33,009 --> 00:01:36,012
-What are you?
-Mom, that hurts.

13
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,695
Mom?

14
00:01:54,072 --> 00:01:55,406
Mom!

15
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,408
Mom.

16
00:02:21,474 --> 00:02:22,725
How can this be?

17
00:02:24,269 --> 00:02:25,395
This is insane.

18
00:02:26,396 --> 00:02:27,355
No…

19
00:02:28,523 --> 00:02:29,440
she's our Ha-ni.

20
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:37,365
Mom, don't be ridiculous.
How can she be Ha-ni?

21
00:02:37,448 --> 00:02:38,616
As if I wouldn't…

22
00:02:40,285 --> 00:02:41,911
recognize my own daughter.

23
00:02:48,209 --> 00:02:49,085
Mom.

24
00:03:07,061 --> 00:03:08,229
I…

25
00:03:10,273 --> 00:03:12,483
I missed you so much, Mom.

26
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:15,528
Right.

27
00:03:16,696 --> 00:03:17,739
Ha-ni.

28
00:03:31,294 --> 00:03:33,087
When did you get so old?

29
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:35,757
Did I?

30
00:03:50,772 --> 00:03:53,566
The Ministry of Food and Drug Safety's
investigation into

31
00:03:53,650 --> 00:03:55,985
Joa Confectionery regarding
the metallic substances

32
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,404
-found in its baby snack revealed…
-They're always in trouble.

33
00:03:58,488 --> 00:04:00,823
Those who mess with children's food

34
00:04:00,907 --> 00:04:03,117
-should be ruined.
-The boycotting of

35
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:05,328
Joa's products has spread online…

36
00:04:08,581 --> 00:04:11,376
Don't be sick, okay?
I hate to have to grow up.

37
00:04:12,168 --> 00:04:15,213
Stop it. This is embarrassing.

38
00:04:15,296 --> 00:04:17,048
Dad, I'm stronger than you now.

39
00:04:18,091 --> 00:04:19,384
You must be so proud.

40
00:04:19,467 --> 00:04:21,177
Of course, I am.

41
00:04:25,723 --> 00:04:26,766
Yu-hyeon.

42
00:04:28,768 --> 00:04:29,769
Yu-hyeon?

43
00:04:32,230 --> 00:04:33,231
Yu-hyeon.

44
00:04:34,691 --> 00:04:37,235
Yu-hyeon!

45
00:04:52,458 --> 00:04:54,585
Yu-hyeon, can you turn on the lights?

46
00:05:00,466 --> 00:05:02,010
Uncle, it's Do-yun.

47
00:05:04,178 --> 00:05:05,346
Can't you see me?

48
00:05:10,893 --> 00:05:13,563
So the lights weren't off.

49
00:05:34,167 --> 00:05:35,168
Dad!

50
00:05:37,628 --> 00:05:39,380
Why the hell did you call him?

51
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:41,883
Dad.

52
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:44,552
Are you okay? I heard you collapsed.

53
00:05:46,345 --> 00:05:49,140
Something happened at work,
and it shocked him a little.

54
00:05:49,223 --> 00:05:50,266
He'll be all right.

55
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:54,604
Are you really okay?

56
00:05:55,271 --> 00:05:57,899
You're not ill, are you?

57
00:05:57,982 --> 00:05:59,275
I told you I'm not.

58
00:06:00,443 --> 00:06:02,653
I'm busy dealing with the mess at work,

59
00:06:02,737 --> 00:06:04,113
so hurry back.

60
00:06:05,782 --> 00:06:07,533
Have all the products been recalled?

61
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:11,829
We have recalled all the products
and announced that we'd be

62
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,624
-paying compensations.
-Do-yun…

63
00:06:14,707 --> 00:06:17,627
We should talk once
you're done briefing my dad.

64
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:18,586
Sure.

65
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:32,433
Yu-hyeon…

66
00:06:33,434 --> 00:06:34,644
must be shocked.

67
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:36,729
It seems that way.

68
00:06:37,772 --> 00:06:40,358
I'll explain
my condition to him when I can,

69
00:06:42,193 --> 00:06:46,072
so cover for me for the time being.

70
00:06:47,490 --> 00:06:51,244
He may be older now,
but he's still emotionally fragile.

71
00:06:52,787 --> 00:06:55,581
He'll have a hard time
coping with my illness.

72
00:06:57,208 --> 00:06:58,668
Of course. You can count on me.

73
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:03,047
He had to lose his mother first,

74
00:07:04,715 --> 00:07:08,761
and here I am
also hammering nails into his heart.

75
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:14,684
I'll talk to him and send him home.
You should get some rest.

76
00:07:34,912 --> 00:07:36,497
I heard what happened on the news.

77
00:07:37,623 --> 00:07:40,209
Was he shocked because of that?

78
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:42,044
Yes.

79
00:07:42,795 --> 00:07:44,755
This will damage our company's business,

80
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:47,341
as well as its reputation.

81
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:50,845
What do we do now?

82
00:07:50,928 --> 00:07:53,764
We'll solve things one step at a time.

83
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,850
Don't you worry about it.

84
00:07:58,519 --> 00:08:01,063
I guess there's nothing I can do
at a time like this.

85
00:08:04,025 --> 00:08:05,943
Is Dad really all right though?

86
00:08:06,777 --> 00:08:09,947
Of course. He'll get better once he rests.

87
00:08:12,575 --> 00:08:13,868
Thanks, Do-yun.

88
00:08:14,702 --> 00:08:18,080
I'm glad that he has you
at a time like this.

89
00:08:19,415 --> 00:08:21,542
Let's go. I should head back inside.

90
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:25,213
Why isn't Aunt here though?

91
00:08:27,089 --> 00:08:29,008
I thought she'd be the first one here.

92
00:08:33,596 --> 00:08:35,765
She's busy with damage control.

93
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,058
I'm here on her behalf.

94
00:08:40,186 --> 00:08:42,563
I couldn't care less about what you think,

95
00:08:43,147 --> 00:08:46,067
but this is as far as you go
with your doubts and suspicions.

96
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:08,047
I know you were all alarmed after
receiving the call at this hour.

97
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:13,052
What I'm about to tell you
is confidential, so bear that in mind.

98
00:09:15,846 --> 00:09:19,725
Our company
has never been met with a crisis

99
00:09:19,809 --> 00:09:21,394
of this size before.

100
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,647
However, even in this gravest of times,

101
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:29,569
the chairman's health
is also at great risk.

102
00:09:33,656 --> 00:09:37,910
So until this crisis is over, we'll enter
a state of emergency management

103
00:09:37,994 --> 00:09:41,539
with me holding the reins.

104
00:09:54,343 --> 00:09:55,886
Girls, pack your bags.

105
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:57,388
What?

106
00:09:57,471 --> 00:10:00,057
When you're at work during the day, Ha-ni…

107
00:10:01,100 --> 00:10:03,436
I doubt she's been eating properly.

108
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,521
So for now, you'll stay with Ha-yeong.

109
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,689
No.

110
00:10:07,523 --> 00:10:09,150
I mean…

111
00:10:09,233 --> 00:10:10,860
Yes, let's go.

112
00:10:11,402 --> 00:10:13,154
We'll get to see Grandma

113
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,739
and Dad will visit us too.

114
00:10:25,458 --> 00:10:28,169
I already told you
he's busy working in Daejeon.

115
00:10:29,545 --> 00:10:31,547
But I want to see him.

116
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,717
We have a lot to pack up anyway,

117
00:10:35,426 --> 00:10:36,886
so just leave for now.

118
00:10:36,969 --> 00:10:38,596
I'll come by soon.

119
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,474
Right, sure.

120
00:10:42,516 --> 00:10:44,226
Ha-yeong, let's go.

121
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:46,228
Sure thing, Mom.

122
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,526
I won't be gone long, so stay put.

123
00:10:52,610 --> 00:10:55,446
But I'd like to walk you out as well.

124
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:57,948
It's cold outside.

125
00:10:58,032 --> 00:11:00,034
I'll come by again soon, so stay here.

126
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:02,286
Got it.

127
00:11:15,299 --> 00:11:16,342
Wait.

128
00:11:19,220 --> 00:11:21,263
Doesn't she know?

129
00:11:24,308 --> 00:11:25,935
I still don't believe it's true,

130
00:11:26,018 --> 00:11:29,063
but let's say that she really is
the younger you.

131
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,482
How can she not know that Dad is dead?

132
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,150
I think…

133
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:37,696
she traveled to this timeline
before the incident happened.

134
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:44,662
Okay, then.

135
00:11:45,746 --> 00:11:46,789
Make sure…

136
00:11:48,124 --> 00:11:50,543
-she never finds out.
-Got it.

137
00:11:52,753 --> 00:11:54,088
Thanks, Mom.

138
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,215
I'm sorry, Ha-yeong.

139
00:11:57,258 --> 00:11:58,300
Don't mention it.

140
00:11:59,135 --> 00:12:00,761
There's no need to apologize to me.

141
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:03,889
Call me if you need anything.

142
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:10,813
Are you sure you're okay though?

143
00:12:12,314 --> 00:12:13,357
You know…

144
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,193
It wasn't that bad.

145
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,030
At times…

146
00:12:21,031 --> 00:12:23,284
I felt as if someone had
sent her to me as a gift.

147
00:12:25,327 --> 00:12:27,413
Right, I see.

148
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:32,460
Now I understand
what brought on this change.

149
00:12:35,546 --> 00:12:38,299
Well, head inside then.

150
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:53,814
I wanted to go with Mom, you know.

151
00:12:57,735 --> 00:13:02,198
It's tough enough for her and Ha-yeong
because of Grandma.

152
00:13:03,991 --> 00:13:06,452
We'll only be making things
harder for them.

153
00:13:08,537 --> 00:13:10,289
We'll visit them some other time.

154
00:13:13,292 --> 00:13:14,251
Got it.

155
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,922
It's fascinating though.

156
00:13:18,923 --> 00:13:20,799
I wonder how Mom recognized me.

157
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,181
It's because she's our mom.

158
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,165
Lastly, despite the role being aimed
by other talented actors,

159
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,583
-Ms. Kim Bok-sun's--
-Stop.

160
00:13:55,501 --> 00:13:58,087
Ms. Kim hates having
her full name mentioned.

161
00:13:59,797 --> 00:14:01,006
Oh, right.

162
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,591
Why do you think

163
00:14:02,675 --> 00:14:06,178
you were chosen by Ms. Kim for the role?

164
00:14:08,180 --> 00:14:09,098
I guess

165
00:14:10,057 --> 00:14:11,559
my sincerity got through to her.

166
00:14:12,351 --> 00:14:13,561
Your sincerity?

167
00:14:13,644 --> 00:14:16,230
She saw me put my heart on full display

168
00:14:16,313 --> 00:14:18,566
and witnessed my inner beauty

169
00:14:18,649 --> 00:14:21,026
from how serious I am
about people and my work.

170
00:14:22,570 --> 00:14:23,612
I see.

171
00:14:24,446 --> 00:14:27,616
Thank you for making time
out of your busy schedule to talk to me.

172
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:29,702
Don't mention it.
The pleasure was all mine.

173
00:14:31,787 --> 00:14:32,830
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

174
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:36,375
It's been a while since
he had an exclusive interview.

175
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,501
Right.

176
00:14:38,085 --> 00:14:39,295
Gosh.

177
00:14:44,383 --> 00:14:46,552
-Here you go.
-Oh, right.

178
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:49,889
-I hope it turns out well.
-Sure.

179
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:51,223
-Thank you.
-No problem.

180
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,393
-Thank you so much.
-Sure.

181
00:14:54,476 --> 00:14:56,145
Thank you!

182
00:14:57,021 --> 00:14:59,189
Gosh. Good job.

183
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,778
-It's been a while? As if.
-I'm not wrong, you know.

184
00:15:06,447 --> 00:15:07,364
Anthony!

185
00:15:07,865 --> 00:15:09,199
What is it?

186
00:15:09,283 --> 00:15:11,452
You've been asked
to be in a mobile phone ad.

187
00:15:11,535 --> 00:15:13,329
This is for you to use.

188
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:14,788
A mobile phone ad?

189
00:15:15,372 --> 00:15:17,041
Will you soon be at the top again?

190
00:15:17,124 --> 00:15:19,627
It's nothing new, so don't get excited.
Act natural.

191
00:15:21,003 --> 00:15:22,296
What is it?

192
00:15:22,379 --> 00:15:27,551
The color is of a radiant shade of violin.

193
00:15:27,635 --> 00:15:28,594
It's just my style.

194
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:31,972
Anthony, it's violet, not "violin."

195
00:15:36,435 --> 00:15:37,436
Ta-da.

196
00:15:39,980 --> 00:15:40,814
There.

197
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:47,488
Every shot looks like a photo shoot.

198
00:15:47,571 --> 00:15:51,116
To celebrate your interview today
and the mobile phone ad,

199
00:15:51,200 --> 00:15:54,286
why don't we get lunch
at someplace decent?

200
00:15:55,162 --> 00:15:58,248
I can't. I have someplace to visit
before my life gets hectic again.

201
00:16:04,546 --> 00:16:07,549
-Are you here for something specific?
-Yes, a gift, actually.

202
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,427
Can you recommend a product for dry skin?

203
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:15,224
This one is popular these days.
Would you like to try it?

204
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,475
Sure.

205
00:16:28,112 --> 00:16:29,113
I quite like it.

206
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:30,489
I'll take a set.

207
00:16:31,865 --> 00:16:33,075
No, two, please.

208
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,000
-What?
-This is weird.

209
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,711
-What do you mean?
-You've been off work for days.

210
00:16:43,794 --> 00:16:45,045
How long is this break?

211
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:50,300
I'll be back at the office soon.

212
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:52,344
-Did you get fired?
-Of course not.

213
00:16:54,304 --> 00:16:57,808
By the way, shouldn't the contest results
be out by now?

214
00:16:57,891 --> 00:16:59,977
Oh, that. You see…

215
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:05,274
Someone must be here. Who is it?

216
00:17:08,777 --> 00:17:10,946
Anthony, what brings you by?

217
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:13,615
No way. It's Chun-sik again.

218
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:15,075
How annoying.

219
00:17:15,159 --> 00:17:16,285
Get ready to be annoyed…

220
00:17:17,161 --> 00:17:18,495
with this high-quality beef.

221
00:17:21,915 --> 00:17:25,669
Gosh, Chun-sik. It's cold outside.
Hurry inside.

222
00:17:25,753 --> 00:17:26,795
Thanks.

223
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:30,549
Don't just stand there.

224
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:31,884
Bring our guest a beverage.

225
00:17:31,967 --> 00:17:33,719
Gosh.

226
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:36,847
Don't forget.
No milk since that'll upset his stomach.

227
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:38,849
Unbelievable.

228
00:17:43,270 --> 00:17:44,480
What brings you by though?

229
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,648
I'll be busy soon,

230
00:17:46,732 --> 00:17:50,778
so I came to see your pretty face
before that happens.

231
00:17:54,114 --> 00:17:56,116
Hey, what are you doing?
That's disgusting.

232
00:17:56,200 --> 00:17:58,869
-What's with you?
-I feel even more disgusted.

233
00:18:01,789 --> 00:18:03,415
Surprise. I got you a gift.

234
00:18:06,126 --> 00:18:07,920
Nice! Chun-sik…

235
00:18:08,003 --> 00:18:10,881
I mean, Anthony, you're the best.

236
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:13,175
-You're the best, Anthony.
-What is this?

237
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:15,094
It's a token of gratitude.

238
00:18:15,177 --> 00:18:16,428
I owe your daughter one.

239
00:18:18,972 --> 00:18:21,475
Let's go eat something nice.

240
00:18:21,558 --> 00:18:22,976
What about the beef you bought?

241
00:18:23,060 --> 00:18:24,311
Have it next time.

242
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:28,023
Today, I'll treat you guys
to a full-course meal.

243
00:18:30,317 --> 00:18:32,277
Anthony, you're amazing.

244
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:46,792
-Is this steak? It looks delicious.
-Enjoy.

245
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:48,836
-It looks yummy.
-Will you be quiet?

246
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:50,879
Let her be. Look how happy she is.

247
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,673
I'll buy you this often.

248
00:18:52,756 --> 00:18:54,591
You can't eat Western food without soup.

249
00:18:54,675 --> 00:18:55,884
Don't they have soup here?

250
00:18:55,968 --> 00:18:58,220
I need to have soup with pepper
to stimulate my appetite.

251
00:18:58,303 --> 00:19:00,973
Western food, soup, and pepper?

252
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,685
That's so old-fashioned.

253
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,228
How do you know about that?

254
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,313
She's very old-fashioned.

255
00:19:08,397 --> 00:19:10,524
No, I don't think that's it.
She's a bit weird.

256
00:19:10,607 --> 00:19:12,234
Why do you think I'm weird?

257
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:15,279
I didn't get a chance to ask you this
at the audition,

258
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,073
but how did you know
I used to love salad bread?

259
00:19:22,411 --> 00:19:23,996
-I told her.
-No.

260
00:19:24,079 --> 00:19:27,332
It didn't seem like she knew
because someone told her.

261
00:19:28,375 --> 00:19:31,879
She was very confident
and talked as if she'd seen it herself.

262
00:19:34,047 --> 00:19:35,132
Let me ask you this.

263
00:19:37,426 --> 00:19:39,428
Could it be that she's not your daughter…

264
00:19:45,726 --> 00:19:47,352
and actually you from the past?

265
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,148
Are you nuts?

266
00:19:51,231 --> 00:19:53,942
What kind of nonsense is that?

267
00:19:55,861 --> 00:19:57,446
Right, sweetheart?

268
00:19:59,656 --> 00:20:01,033
Yes, exactly.

269
00:20:01,116 --> 00:20:04,953
Gosh, Chun-sik is really weird.

270
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:07,956
-You're weird.
-You really are.

271
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:15,672
I guess so. I've been watching movies
about time traveling these days.

272
00:20:15,756 --> 00:20:18,842
Because of that,
I keep getting these funny ideas.

273
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:21,094
My imagination's been going crazy.

274
00:20:23,096 --> 00:20:24,056
Eat up.

275
00:20:32,022 --> 00:20:34,066
Let me take this call.

276
00:20:34,149 --> 00:20:34,983
Okay.

277
00:20:36,777 --> 00:20:39,738
Where are you going?

278
00:20:44,826 --> 00:20:45,786
Hello?

279
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,289
What? Really?

280
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,543
Thank you. Okay, bye.

281
00:21:13,272 --> 00:21:14,273
Hey, Old Lady.

282
00:21:14,356 --> 00:21:16,942
Yu-hyeon, did you get a call
from the office?

283
00:21:17,025 --> 00:21:20,112
Yes, they told me to come back to work.

284
00:21:20,195 --> 00:21:21,363
Did you also get a call?

285
00:21:22,447 --> 00:21:25,158
Yes, I think the misunderstanding
finally got resolved.

286
00:21:25,242 --> 00:21:28,287
See? I told you everything will be okay.

287
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:32,082
Yes, you were right.

288
00:21:33,750 --> 00:21:35,210
I'll see you tomorrow, Old Lady.

289
00:21:43,885 --> 00:21:47,222
We couldn't find any evidence
to prove it was plagiarized.

290
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:51,852
So we decided to settle the issue
just by canceling their award.

291
00:21:51,935 --> 00:21:53,145
Okay, you may leave.

292
00:22:02,195 --> 00:22:03,947
I never should've trusted you.

293
00:22:04,531 --> 00:22:05,907
I'm sorry, Mother.

294
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,618
Do you think I'm a joke?

295
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,371
No, that's not it.

296
00:22:12,748 --> 00:22:15,917
I just figured doing what's not right

297
00:22:16,001 --> 00:22:18,754
would eventually end up

298
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,841
harming the family in the long run.

299
00:22:22,924 --> 00:22:26,345
"Family"? You don't even deserve
to say that word right now.

300
00:22:30,223 --> 00:22:31,349
Okay. Just leave.

301
00:22:33,727 --> 00:22:35,062
I'm sorry, Mother.

302
00:22:45,113 --> 00:22:46,198
What's all that?

303
00:22:47,157 --> 00:22:49,534
I'm going to take this to Ha-ni tomorrow.

304
00:22:49,618 --> 00:22:52,704
I doubt they were able to eat
anything decent on their own.

305
00:22:53,955 --> 00:22:56,500
Mom, do you actually believe that?

306
00:22:56,583 --> 00:23:00,212
Do you think you won't be able
to recognize your son

307
00:23:00,295 --> 00:23:02,297
after all those years?

308
00:23:04,299 --> 00:23:07,636
I'm sure she's Ha-ni.

309
00:23:08,220 --> 00:23:12,182
I don't know why this is happening,

310
00:23:14,267 --> 00:23:17,187
but I'm sure there's a reason.

311
00:23:27,989 --> 00:23:30,033
You're so much prettier now.

312
00:23:30,117 --> 00:23:33,662
Your skin looks so soft.
It makes you glow.

313
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,248
Let's see.

314
00:23:38,834 --> 00:23:40,877
We really do look alike.

315
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,088
Do you think so?

316
00:23:44,464 --> 00:23:47,050
Then why don't we try something?

317
00:23:51,888 --> 00:23:54,141
Make a face. Ta-da.

318
00:23:58,979 --> 00:23:59,980
Take a look.

319
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:08,113
Gosh, it actually looks like
someone took a selfie.

320
00:24:08,196 --> 00:24:09,614
-Right?
-Yes.

321
00:24:09,698 --> 00:24:11,158
I think it's cool too.

322
00:24:14,161 --> 00:24:15,453
Can you send me this?

323
00:24:15,954 --> 00:24:19,291
Once I go back, I want to look at it
every time I miss you.

324
00:24:22,669 --> 00:24:24,129
Can't I take this?

325
00:24:24,212 --> 00:24:26,006
I don't think you can.

326
00:24:28,425 --> 00:24:30,051
That's the saddest thing ever.

327
00:24:31,344 --> 00:24:33,638
Instead, I'll use it
as much as I want here.

328
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:36,141
Oh, right.

329
00:24:40,395 --> 00:24:41,354
Okay.

330
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:45,525
I thought you still had a few days off.

331
00:24:45,609 --> 00:24:46,818
Why are you suddenly going to work?

332
00:24:48,778 --> 00:24:49,946
Something came up.

333
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:51,823
I see.

334
00:24:55,035 --> 00:24:57,037
Something's happened to Joa Confectionery.

335
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,122
What do you mean?

336
00:24:59,706 --> 00:25:02,500
Look. There are tons of articles.

337
00:25:02,584 --> 00:25:03,752
What is this?

338
00:25:05,337 --> 00:25:06,755
JOA CONFECTIONARY

339
00:25:09,341 --> 00:25:10,300
What?

340
00:25:10,383 --> 00:25:12,802
JOA CONFECTIONARY RECALLS
BABY SNACK WITH METALLIC SUBSTANCES

341
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:19,559
I saw the articles last night,
and I was shocked.

342
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:22,896
You saw them too?

343
00:25:23,897 --> 00:25:27,692
I wonder if the chairman is okay.

344
00:25:28,235 --> 00:25:30,028
Stuff like this keeps happening.

345
00:25:31,821 --> 00:25:32,864
I'm sure he's fine.

346
00:25:37,744 --> 00:25:39,996
Yu-hyeon, is there something wrong?

347
00:25:40,956 --> 00:25:42,916
You don't look well.

348
00:25:44,292 --> 00:25:48,380
I just have a lot on my mind
due to a few things.

349
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:51,549
I don't know what's going on,

350
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:55,804
but if you ever need my help,
let me know whenever.

351
00:25:56,638 --> 00:25:59,349
You were a big comfort to me,

352
00:25:59,432 --> 00:26:02,852
and I want to do the same for you.

353
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:06,356
Thank you.

354
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,117
Congratulations, Ms. Bahn.

355
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,370
I'm glad things worked out.

356
00:26:20,453 --> 00:26:21,538
See?

357
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:24,791
I told you she would never do
something like that.

358
00:26:25,542 --> 00:26:28,670
You weren't the only one who said that.
We all thought the same thing.

359
00:26:29,713 --> 00:26:33,341
Thank you all so much for trusting me.

360
00:26:33,425 --> 00:26:34,592
I'm glad you're back.

361
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:39,764
Yes, thank you.

362
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:43,143
But what happened?

363
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,936
The articles seemed really serious.

364
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,981
The whole company's been troubled
because of that.

365
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,691
Some say there will be

366
00:26:49,774 --> 00:26:52,360
disciplinary measures
after the investigation is over.

367
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:54,029
That's not all.

368
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,656
Mothers are furious at us
for messing with baby snacks,

369
00:26:56,740 --> 00:26:59,659
so they even started
boycotting our products.

370
00:26:59,743 --> 00:27:01,286
It's a complete mess.

371
00:27:01,369 --> 00:27:03,371
Thanks to that, our stock price…

372
00:27:04,789 --> 00:27:06,124
It went down even more.

373
00:27:06,207 --> 00:27:08,626
Gosh, I'm doomed. This is so bad.

374
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:12,380
We're trying our best to deal with it,

375
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:16,384
so try not to get too swayed
and just focus on work.

376
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:18,053
-Okay.
-Got it.

377
00:27:18,136 --> 00:27:19,804
-Okay.
-Let's get back to work.

378
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:22,557
-Let's go.
-What is that?

379
00:27:24,100 --> 00:27:26,102
Thank you for helping me.

380
00:27:26,186 --> 00:27:29,522
I'll make sure
you're not held responsible,

381
00:27:29,606 --> 00:27:30,523
so don't worry.

382
00:27:31,524 --> 00:27:33,485
Actually, I've been thinking…

383
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:36,321
Compared to the risk I'm taking,

384
00:27:36,404 --> 00:27:39,866
I don't think I'm getting
enough out of this.

385
00:27:42,702 --> 00:27:44,788
I don't know what you're scheming,

386
00:27:45,789 --> 00:27:48,458
but I'm smart enough to know
how big of an issue this is.

387
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:51,544
What did you just say?

388
00:27:55,715 --> 00:27:59,969
But wouldn't that
do considerable damage to the company?

389
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:02,472
That's what I want.

390
00:28:03,973 --> 00:28:06,810
It's time you work at the headquarters.

391
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:09,187
By the way, I heard your daughter

392
00:28:09,270 --> 00:28:11,523
-How dare you?
-is about to graduate college.

393
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:15,860
Don't look at me that way.

394
00:28:15,944 --> 00:28:19,656
You and I are on the same boat anyway.

395
00:28:21,491 --> 00:28:26,287
Take your time to think about it,
and call me once you make up your mind.

396
00:28:47,809 --> 00:28:48,685
Do-yun.

397
00:28:49,519 --> 00:28:52,147
There's something I need you to do for me.

398
00:28:54,482 --> 00:28:55,483
Ladies.

399
00:28:56,985 --> 00:28:59,195
Ladies, I made you kale juice

400
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:01,489
to celebrate my return.

401
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,784
-Thank you.
-Thanks.

402
00:29:09,164 --> 00:29:10,540
What is this?

403
00:29:11,040 --> 00:29:12,917
-Did you make this with grass?
-Come on.

404
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:15,837
That stuff is really good for your skin.

405
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,756
It'll make you look ten years younger.

406
00:29:18,256 --> 00:29:21,801
I must say, it's nice to have him back.

407
00:29:22,844 --> 00:29:25,263
-You're happy I'm back, right?
-Yes.

408
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:27,390
Goodness.

409
00:29:28,099 --> 00:29:29,893
-Hey.
-Did you hear the news?

410
00:29:29,976 --> 00:29:34,314
The company's apparently going to fire
all the kitchen and cleaning staff.

411
00:29:34,397 --> 00:29:36,232
What? What do you mean?

412
00:29:36,316 --> 00:29:39,986
They're going to fire all of us
and hire a subcontractor for the job.

413
00:29:40,069 --> 00:29:42,197
Are you sure you're not mistaken?

414
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,574
-The chairman would never do that.
-I agree.

415
00:29:44,657 --> 00:29:48,536
Look around.
He even let us use this lounge.

416
00:29:48,620 --> 00:29:51,664
And he hired all the kitchen
and cleaning staff full-time.

417
00:29:51,748 --> 00:29:53,666
He'd never do such a thing.

418
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,464
DAD

419
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,465
Hey, Do-yun. It's me.

420
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:45,260
Did Dad get discharged today?

421
00:30:46,302 --> 00:30:48,012
I came to the hospital,

422
00:30:48,930 --> 00:30:50,849
but he's not here, and he won't pick up.

423
00:30:52,225 --> 00:30:54,978
Something urgent came up.
He went on a business trip abroad.

424
00:30:55,061 --> 00:30:56,312
He went abroad?

425
00:30:57,981 --> 00:31:01,693
Why would he go on a business trip
when he's not even feeling well?

426
00:31:01,776 --> 00:31:04,612
It was an urgent matter,
so he had to go himself.

427
00:31:08,283 --> 00:31:11,703
Okay. Then tell him to call me

428
00:31:11,786 --> 00:31:13,371
if you get a hold of him.

429
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:15,164
I will.

430
00:31:20,587 --> 00:31:21,713
Let's go.

431
00:31:28,845 --> 00:31:33,975
I'd like to tell Yu-hyeon myself
once I'm ready to do so.

432
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:35,935
Okay.

433
00:31:43,818 --> 00:31:44,736
Watch the stairs.

434
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,741
Here you go.

435
00:31:54,495 --> 00:31:55,538
Nice.

436
00:31:59,584 --> 00:32:01,377
It's so delicious.

437
00:32:01,461 --> 00:32:04,297
You always made jangjorim with pork
instead of beef.

438
00:32:04,380 --> 00:32:05,506
What's gotten into you?

439
00:32:08,885 --> 00:32:09,844
Look at you.

440
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:15,183
I'm starting to remember how bright
and pretty you used to be.

441
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,936
I know, right?
What happened to the old Ha-ni?

442
00:32:18,019 --> 00:32:19,938
She's a lot better now.

443
00:32:20,021 --> 00:32:23,066
But when we first met,
she was a complete mess.

444
00:32:23,149 --> 00:32:24,817
She was so depressed.

445
00:32:27,695 --> 00:32:30,782
That's too salty on its own.
Eat it with rice.

446
00:32:32,116 --> 00:32:34,911
-You didn't eat, right?
-Seriously?

447
00:32:34,994 --> 00:32:37,705
Nice. It's been ages
since I got to eat your food.

448
00:32:37,789 --> 00:32:40,917
Mom's homemade meal

449
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:43,836
I love my mom's homemade meal

450
00:32:47,298 --> 00:32:51,511
My parents and friends keep asking
if everything's okay with the company.

451
00:32:51,594 --> 00:32:54,514
It's making me feel so nervous.

452
00:32:54,597 --> 00:32:55,515
You're right.

453
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:58,601
People started boycotting
some of our other products too.

454
00:32:58,685 --> 00:33:00,395
This is really bad.

455
00:33:00,478 --> 00:33:03,898
There's actually a stock market site
I frequently visit,

456
00:33:04,440 --> 00:33:07,527
and I keep seeing weird posts
ever since yesterday.

457
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,778
Like what?

458
00:33:08,861 --> 00:33:11,781
-What's this?
-Some think this was all fabricated.

459
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:12,865
"Fabricated"?

460
00:33:12,949 --> 00:33:15,618
After the issue plummeted our stocks,

461
00:33:15,702 --> 00:33:19,497
a certain group of people apparently
have been buying our stocks.

462
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:21,582
So they think this was all planned.

463
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,001
That's absurd.

464
00:33:23,084 --> 00:33:25,294
So they think someone did this on purpose?

465
00:33:25,378 --> 00:33:27,088
-I'm just stating the rumor.
-Gosh.

466
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,382
That can't be true.

467
00:33:29,465 --> 00:33:30,883
-Who in the world…
-It can't be.

468
00:33:30,967 --> 00:33:32,093
-No way.
-It's absurd.

469
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:34,345
-Who would do that?
-I'm sure it's wrong.

470
00:33:34,429 --> 00:33:35,680
-You think so?
-Of course.

471
00:33:35,763 --> 00:33:36,806
It could be true.

472
00:33:42,228 --> 00:33:43,604
Are you okay?

473
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,274
You don't look so well.

474
00:33:46,357 --> 00:33:50,403
I'm okay. I think I'm just stressed
due to what's been going on at work.

475
00:33:52,238 --> 00:33:54,532
Here. It's warm yuja tea.

476
00:33:54,615 --> 00:33:56,701
I'm sure it'll help you feel better.

477
00:33:57,410 --> 00:33:58,453
Thanks.

478
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:07,545
By any chance,

479
00:34:08,921 --> 00:34:10,965
if it seems like

480
00:34:12,425 --> 00:34:16,262
someone you know is doing something wrong,

481
00:34:17,472 --> 00:34:18,973
what would you do?

482
00:34:21,559 --> 00:34:24,020
Does that person

483
00:34:24,937 --> 00:34:26,439
mean a lot to you?

484
00:34:27,648 --> 00:34:28,816
Yes.

485
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:30,359
Then…

486
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:35,406
you should tell that person to stop

487
00:34:36,574 --> 00:34:39,327
before they ruin themself.

488
00:34:52,131 --> 00:34:53,633
What brings you here?

489
00:34:54,383 --> 00:34:55,218
Mother.

490
00:34:59,347 --> 00:35:04,602
I have something to tell you.

491
00:35:04,685 --> 00:35:06,938
-What is it?
-Well…

492
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:14,278
If, by any chance, you were involved with

493
00:35:15,530 --> 00:35:19,242
the recent events that have been
happening to the company,

494
00:35:22,578 --> 00:35:25,331
I think you should stop.

495
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:34,090
Are you trying to lecture me right now?

496
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:37,176
No, Mother. That's not it.

497
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,427
I don't want you

498
00:35:39,011 --> 00:35:43,975
to ruin yourself anymore.

499
00:35:46,435 --> 00:35:51,023
I want to help you before that happens.

500
00:35:51,107 --> 00:35:52,483
Shut up.

501
00:35:53,526 --> 00:35:55,236
You may be Do-yun's wife,

502
00:35:55,319 --> 00:35:57,780
but I've never considered you
as my daughter-in-law.

503
00:35:58,781 --> 00:36:01,117
How dare you?

504
00:36:02,285 --> 00:36:03,286
Listen carefully.

505
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:05,538
That baby of yours is our bloodline,

506
00:36:05,621 --> 00:36:06,998
but not you.

507
00:36:19,552 --> 00:36:20,803
Is something wrong?

508
00:36:21,804 --> 00:36:23,139
No.

509
00:36:27,351 --> 00:36:29,353
-What is it?
-It's nothing.

510
00:36:29,937 --> 00:36:31,147
Go take a shower.

511
00:36:31,230 --> 00:36:32,773
I'll prepare dinner.

512
00:36:39,488 --> 00:36:41,616
I said I'd take care of it.

513
00:36:41,699 --> 00:36:44,660
-Stop dragging her into this.
-I don't plan on doing that either.

514
00:36:47,246 --> 00:36:49,207
Did you take care
of what I asked you to do?

515
00:36:51,334 --> 00:36:53,753
I'm meeting the factory head manager
tomorrow,

516
00:36:53,836 --> 00:36:54,795
so that's that.

517
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,638
I bought this for you two.
I hope I'm not being a nuisance.

518
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,765
The more, the merrier.

519
00:37:06,974 --> 00:37:08,059
Gochujang.

520
00:37:14,899 --> 00:37:16,484
We're out of gochujang.

521
00:37:16,567 --> 00:37:19,362
I need to go buy some gochujang.
Wait for me.

522
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:22,573
We can dip it in salt. It's much tastier.

523
00:37:22,657 --> 00:37:25,743
I always have beef with gochujang.

524
00:37:26,994 --> 00:37:28,371
You're as picky as your mom.

525
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:29,622
I can hear you.

526
00:37:36,587 --> 00:37:37,755
I'm out of money.

527
00:37:38,798 --> 00:37:40,633
Use my card. It's in the inner pocket.

528
00:37:40,716 --> 00:37:42,093
Take whichever card you want.

529
00:37:43,344 --> 00:37:45,930
Yes! Can I just buy whatever I want?

530
00:37:46,013 --> 00:37:47,556
Sure. Anything you want.

531
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:49,100
Even a house or a car.

532
00:37:50,643 --> 00:37:51,936
Oh, yes.

533
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:55,940
Bye.

534
00:37:56,023 --> 00:37:58,985
Beef gets cooked quickly! Hurry!

535
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:16,002
God, that little wench. She's out again.

536
00:38:27,513 --> 00:38:29,432
I almost died!

537
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,394
Hey! Have you gone insane?

538
00:38:41,110 --> 00:38:42,862
The meat's getting burned. Come eat.

539
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:49,618
-What? You're here too.
-We need to talk.

540
00:39:02,631 --> 00:39:05,718
Scarlett wanted to have some meat,

541
00:39:05,801 --> 00:39:07,762
but she had no grill. So…

542
00:39:08,554 --> 00:39:10,014
I'm sorry,

543
00:39:10,097 --> 00:39:13,184
but I don't want you to see her anymore.

544
00:39:13,893 --> 00:39:16,103
Even if she contacts you, just ignore her.

545
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:19,190
Why are you being like this
out of the blue?

546
00:39:19,273 --> 00:39:21,192
Did I do something wrong?

547
00:39:22,068 --> 00:39:24,653
-I won't do it again.
-That's not why. It's just…

548
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,448
We're in a bit of a situation.

549
00:39:27,531 --> 00:39:29,367
And what's that?

550
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:34,663
I knew something was off,
but I didn't want to fight.

551
00:39:34,747 --> 00:39:37,166
I'm not a prisoner.

552
00:39:37,249 --> 00:39:40,002
Why do you forbid me from going out
and meeting people?

553
00:39:40,086 --> 00:39:41,504
Why do I have to stay home?

554
00:39:41,587 --> 00:39:43,255
What are you hiding from me?

555
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:44,382
Nothing.

556
00:39:45,674 --> 00:39:47,343
You can't fool me.

557
00:39:47,426 --> 00:39:48,803
I can tell when you're lying.

558
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:51,097
Tell me the truth.

559
00:39:51,180 --> 00:39:53,808
If you don't, I'm going to do
whatever I want from now on.

560
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,643
I'll go wherever I want

561
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,520
and never listen to you,

562
00:39:57,603 --> 00:39:59,480
so do as you wish.

563
00:40:04,902 --> 00:40:07,071
Anthony, I'm sorry,

564
00:40:07,655 --> 00:40:10,324
but could you leave?

565
00:40:20,167 --> 00:40:21,168
Something's not right.

566
00:40:22,253 --> 00:40:26,173
They don't seem like
a mother and a daughter.

567
00:40:28,801 --> 00:40:30,052
So…

568
00:40:32,304 --> 00:40:33,639
So, are you saying

569
00:40:35,015 --> 00:40:36,642
that I'm going to die?

570
00:40:38,394 --> 00:40:40,688
That means the incident that happened
just now

571
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,815
and the accident back then

572
00:40:43,566 --> 00:40:45,401
weren't coincidental.

573
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,070
Probably not.

574
00:40:53,617 --> 00:40:55,870
No, don't you worry about a thing.

575
00:40:56,954 --> 00:41:01,834
No matter what, I'm going to send you back
safe and sound.

576
00:41:03,127 --> 00:41:04,503
I'm scared.

577
00:41:05,713 --> 00:41:08,966
This is exactly why
I didn't want to tell you about this.

578
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,933
I'm sorry. I had no idea

579
00:41:18,767 --> 00:41:20,561
and threatened to do as I wished.

580
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:23,689
Don't be. I'm going to make sure

581
00:41:24,690 --> 00:41:27,651
nothing happens to you.

582
00:41:27,735 --> 00:41:30,029
So don't be afraid.

583
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:31,822
Okay?

584
00:41:55,763 --> 00:41:58,015
Maybe it's because of that rumor,

585
00:41:58,098 --> 00:41:59,808
I just can't seem to focus.

586
00:42:00,434 --> 00:42:03,020
We're already feeling troubled as is.

587
00:42:03,103 --> 00:42:05,356
Where in the world is Yu-hyeon?

588
00:42:05,439 --> 00:42:08,192
I don't know. He took the day off
for some reason.

589
00:42:08,275 --> 00:42:10,694
Perhaps, he's looking for another job.

590
00:42:24,166 --> 00:42:27,670
That man, Cha Seung-seok, is in Incheon.

591
00:42:27,753 --> 00:42:28,754
Incheon?

592
00:42:32,591 --> 00:42:36,762
He was promoted by Joa Confectionery
and was sent to the Incheon branch.

593
00:42:37,304 --> 00:42:39,431
Oh, I see.

594
00:42:41,308 --> 00:42:43,269
Thank you. It was urgent.

595
00:42:43,352 --> 00:42:44,562
Don't worry about it.

596
00:42:45,729 --> 00:42:49,650
I owe you for what I did to you
when we first met.

597
00:42:49,733 --> 00:42:52,736
We're even now, okay?

598
00:42:53,445 --> 00:42:54,321
Okay.

599
00:42:55,364 --> 00:42:59,827
By the way, he seemed to be in
quite a predicament.

600
00:43:01,036 --> 00:43:02,746
He became an orphan at a young age.

601
00:43:02,830 --> 00:43:06,709
The only family he has
is his sick grandma.

602
00:43:27,521 --> 00:43:31,817
Excuse me. May I ask you a question?

603
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:38,991
Is anyone in?

604
00:43:51,253 --> 00:43:52,379
Excuse me.

605
00:43:53,547 --> 00:43:55,090
Is anyone in there?

606
00:44:02,264 --> 00:44:03,265
Excuse me.

607
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:13,609
Ma'am.

608
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:15,986
Ma'am.

609
00:44:16,070 --> 00:44:17,237
Ma'am.

610
00:44:20,824 --> 00:44:27,581
QUARANTINE AREA

611
00:44:36,256 --> 00:44:37,633
MY GRANDSON

612
00:44:40,386 --> 00:44:43,472
Grandma, how are you feeling?
Are you in pain?

613
00:44:44,932 --> 00:44:47,559
Seung-seok. It's me, Yu-hyeon.

614
00:44:50,771 --> 00:44:54,066
Why do you have her phone?

615
00:44:54,149 --> 00:44:56,110
Your grandma wasn't feeling well,

616
00:44:56,193 --> 00:44:57,903
so I took her to the hospital.

617
00:44:58,737 --> 00:45:01,240
She's sleeping right now,

618
00:45:01,865 --> 00:45:02,991
so don't worry too much.

619
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,146
Grandma!

620
00:45:34,106 --> 00:45:35,899
-Hey.
-Yu-hyeon.

621
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,693
Dinner's ready. Let's eat.

622
00:45:42,990 --> 00:45:43,991
All right.

623
00:45:49,496 --> 00:45:52,499
Grandma, it's hot. You better be careful.

624
00:45:54,918 --> 00:45:57,504
So you're Seung-seok's friend?

625
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,467
I've never seen such a young man
like you cook so well.

626
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,344
To tell you the truth,
I'm pretty much good

627
00:46:04,428 --> 00:46:05,804
at everything.

628
00:46:05,888 --> 00:46:07,181
Do you want to see?

629
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:10,350
Ta-da.

630
00:46:12,352 --> 00:46:14,605
My eyesight isn't that great.

631
00:46:16,148 --> 00:46:19,318
Just know that I'm good at anything
and everything.

632
00:46:19,401 --> 00:46:21,403
Thank you so much.

633
00:46:21,487 --> 00:46:24,239
How could I repay your kindness?

634
00:46:24,323 --> 00:46:25,782
Don't worry about it.

635
00:46:25,866 --> 00:46:27,284
- Grandma.
- Yes?

636
00:46:28,994 --> 00:46:31,371
Take your time and chew well.

637
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:36,460
-Eat up.
-Okay.

638
00:46:45,135 --> 00:46:45,969
Yu-hyeon.

639
00:46:47,262 --> 00:46:48,263
I'm truly sorry.

640
00:46:50,724 --> 00:46:51,934
I understand.

641
00:46:53,101 --> 00:46:54,811
You must've had your reasons.

642
00:46:57,231 --> 00:46:58,357
I'm sorry.

643
00:46:59,024 --> 00:47:02,361
Hey. I'm not here to blame you

644
00:47:02,945 --> 00:47:04,655
or hear an apology.

645
00:47:05,697 --> 00:47:09,535
But do tell me this one thing.

646
00:47:10,577 --> 00:47:13,664
My aunt told you to do it, didn't she?

647
00:47:17,626 --> 00:47:18,710
Yes.

648
00:47:19,920 --> 00:47:23,090
Actually, there is one more accomplice

649
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,510
who helped her out.

650
00:47:41,775 --> 00:47:44,528
Hello, Yu-hyeon. What is it?

651
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,407
Ji-eun, can we talk for a minute?

652
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,378
To tell you the truth, I know everything.

653
00:48:02,004 --> 00:48:06,300
I know that Aunt was the one
behind the recent plagiarism incident.

654
00:48:09,219 --> 00:48:13,181
I also know that you refused to help her.

655
00:48:14,016 --> 00:48:17,436
And that's probably why
Ms. Bahn and I could return.

656
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:26,445
I'm sorry for not telling you
about this sooner.

657
00:48:26,528 --> 00:48:31,408
Don't be.
Ji-eun, you're a truly good person.

658
00:48:32,701 --> 00:48:36,371
And I understand the situation
you were in.

659
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:43,795
How involved was Do-yun in this incident?

660
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:46,381
Not at all. You got it wrong.

661
00:48:46,465 --> 00:48:49,468
Do-yun is in the dark.

662
00:48:50,218 --> 00:48:54,473
If he finds out that I was swayed,

663
00:48:55,766 --> 00:48:58,268
he'll be greatly disappointed in me.

664
00:48:59,728 --> 00:49:01,897
Right. You're probably right.

665
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:04,858
The Do-yun I know…

666
00:49:06,234 --> 00:49:08,236
would never do such a thing.

667
00:49:16,912 --> 00:49:19,706
So, how much do you want?

668
00:49:20,916 --> 00:49:22,376
I guess that depends

669
00:49:23,043 --> 00:49:27,422
on how important this is to her.

670
00:49:38,850 --> 00:49:40,686
You've been duplicating the ledgers

671
00:49:40,769 --> 00:49:42,562
and embezzling money.

672
00:49:43,397 --> 00:49:45,190
Then you gambled with it.

673
00:49:45,774 --> 00:49:49,444
I believe we could exchange those photos

674
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:53,407
with the voice recording that you have.

675
00:49:56,451 --> 00:49:57,494
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAN JI-SUK

676
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,620
Did he have any copies?

677
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:04,042
Probably not. Even if he did,
he won't be able to do anything

678
00:50:04,126 --> 00:50:06,086
since we have something on him.

679
00:50:07,546 --> 00:50:09,548
All right. Good job.

680
00:50:12,426 --> 00:50:14,094
How's my brother doing?

681
00:50:14,177 --> 00:50:15,971
Does he like the villa?

682
00:50:17,431 --> 00:50:20,016
I'd like you to take

683
00:50:20,100 --> 00:50:23,270
the shares he has for this company.

684
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:26,440
What do you say?

685
00:50:27,733 --> 00:50:29,818
-Sorry?
-I'm sure you can wheedle him

686
00:50:29,901 --> 00:50:31,528
into giving those shares to you.

687
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,406
Must you go that far?

688
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:37,784
It's because of you
that he has gone blind.

689
00:50:39,703 --> 00:50:42,497
It was bound to happen anyway,

690
00:50:42,581 --> 00:50:43,999
so why is that my fault?

691
00:50:44,082 --> 00:50:47,544
Were you always this cruel?

692
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,089
Are you trying to be good all of a sudden?

693
00:50:51,631 --> 00:50:53,967
You and I are already in the same boat.

694
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:17,783
Should I get you something to eat?

695
00:51:17,866 --> 00:51:20,786
I don't think you even had dinner.

696
00:51:21,953 --> 00:51:23,121
I'm not hungry.

697
00:51:23,205 --> 00:51:24,456
Still…

698
00:51:25,999 --> 00:51:28,710
you should eat something to stay strong.

699
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:39,638
Can I stay with our parents?

700
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:42,516
Why all of a sudden?

701
00:51:43,934 --> 00:51:48,021
To be honest,
I'm scared of being home alone all day.

702
00:51:48,730 --> 00:51:52,108
I get startled whenever the wind
rattles the windows,

703
00:51:52,192 --> 00:51:56,446
and the sound of a cat's meow
gives me goosebumps.

704
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:03,453
I just want to stay with them.

705
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:10,877
She's going to die?

706
00:52:10,961 --> 00:52:12,712
I don't understand it either.

707
00:52:12,796 --> 00:52:15,715
But if she doesn't return soon,

708
00:52:15,799 --> 00:52:17,342
something bad may happen to her.

709
00:52:20,178 --> 00:52:22,180
How can she go back?

710
00:52:22,264 --> 00:52:25,433
I'm still looking into that.

711
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:30,522
In any case,
I know you two are already busy

712
00:52:31,064 --> 00:52:33,441
taking care of Seong-u and Grandma.

713
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:37,988
I'm sorry for being a burden.

714
00:52:38,071 --> 00:52:39,531
Don't be sorry.

715
00:52:39,614 --> 00:52:41,324
Our family is in danger.

716
00:52:43,034 --> 00:52:44,327
When times are rough,

717
00:52:45,078 --> 00:52:47,330
we need to protect each other.

718
00:52:47,956 --> 00:52:50,876
I told Seong-u
that she'll be staying here temporarily

719
00:52:51,376 --> 00:52:53,920
due to certain reasons,

720
00:52:54,004 --> 00:52:56,631
-so don't worry.
-Thank you.

721
00:52:57,799 --> 00:52:58,967
You too.

722
00:52:59,551 --> 00:53:00,427
You, fool.

723
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:04,723
How could you carry the burden
all by yourself every single time?

724
00:53:05,390 --> 00:53:06,850
It must have eaten you up

725
00:53:08,059 --> 00:53:09,728
every time you did that.

726
00:53:10,604 --> 00:53:11,605
It's okay.

727
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:15,358
I'm fine now.

728
00:53:15,442 --> 00:53:17,068
I'm no longer alone.

729
00:53:27,495 --> 00:53:30,248
It's even tastier
since my puppy gave it to me.

730
00:53:30,332 --> 00:53:31,249
Is that so?

731
00:53:32,876 --> 00:53:34,711
-Have some.
-Okay.

732
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:39,507
My son? What are you doing?

733
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:43,970
I'm just tending to our guest.

734
00:53:46,973 --> 00:53:48,642
Go to your room this instant.

735
00:53:55,231 --> 00:53:57,692
-I'm sorry.
-Me too.

736
00:54:01,029 --> 00:54:02,322
Hey.

737
00:54:02,405 --> 00:54:04,407
We'll take care of her, so you should go.

738
00:54:04,491 --> 00:54:07,494
Once you wrap up everything,
move back here immediately.

739
00:54:08,411 --> 00:54:09,412
Okay.

740
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,332
-Hey.
-Yes?

741
00:54:14,793 --> 00:54:17,921
Listen to mom and Ha-yeong.

742
00:54:18,004 --> 00:54:20,215
And please watch what you say

743
00:54:21,257 --> 00:54:22,467
in front of Seong-u.

744
00:54:22,550 --> 00:54:23,760
I will.

745
00:54:25,845 --> 00:54:26,972
Do you have your wallet?

746
00:54:28,223 --> 00:54:30,642
Make sure you carry it with you
wherever you go.

747
00:54:30,725 --> 00:54:31,768
Okay.

748
00:54:32,477 --> 00:54:35,480
In return, you better come visit me often.

749
00:54:35,563 --> 00:54:36,398
Okay?

750
00:54:42,070 --> 00:54:43,238
I will.

751
00:55:04,509 --> 00:55:05,593
Yu-hyeon.

752
00:55:11,474 --> 00:55:13,476
Hi, old lady.

753
00:55:22,736 --> 00:55:24,320
It's so cold out.

754
00:55:24,404 --> 00:55:27,240
How long have you been waiting for me?

755
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,284
You should've called.

756
00:55:29,367 --> 00:55:32,078
It's okay. I wasn't cold at all.

757
00:55:33,204 --> 00:55:36,833
I loved waiting for you

758
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,919
because I knew you'd come eventually.

759
00:55:44,841 --> 00:55:45,884
Old lady.

760
00:55:46,843 --> 00:55:48,636
I mean, Ms. Bahn.

761
00:55:51,097 --> 00:55:55,018
How much do you know

762
00:55:56,478 --> 00:55:57,687
about me?

763
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:07,530
I know that you're a good person.

764
00:56:08,990 --> 00:56:12,702
You're kindhearted, cheerful,
and warmhearted.

765
00:56:14,746 --> 00:56:18,958
No. I mean who I really am.

766
00:56:22,295 --> 00:56:23,797
What do you mean?

767
00:56:27,175 --> 00:56:28,343
Even if…

768
00:56:30,637 --> 00:56:34,224
I don't turn out to be
who you thought I was,

769
00:56:36,226 --> 00:56:37,811
don't be too shocked.

770
00:56:38,895 --> 00:56:39,896
Because…

771
00:56:41,981 --> 00:56:44,317
I never meant to deceive you.

772
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:52,575
-Yu-hyeon.
-I should go.

773
00:56:52,659 --> 00:56:53,993
I wanted to tell you this.

774
00:57:19,394 --> 00:57:24,983
DAD

775
00:57:42,417 --> 00:57:45,420
Sir, please follow that car.

776
00:58:07,775 --> 00:58:09,527
YU-HYEON, IS SOMETHING WRONG?

777
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:14,240
YOU'RE WORRYING ME, SO PLEASE REPLY

778
00:58:14,991 --> 00:58:16,576
God, I can't believe it.

779
00:58:16,659 --> 00:58:18,495
-Did you hear?
-About what?

780
00:58:19,204 --> 00:58:20,371
What's going on?

781
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,373
A hit list has been circulating

782
00:58:23,791 --> 00:58:25,251
on the intranet.

783
00:58:25,793 --> 00:58:27,253
-What?
-What do you mean?

784
00:58:27,837 --> 00:58:29,589
Someone has posted

785
00:58:29,672 --> 00:58:32,842
a list of people who'll get laid off
on the anonymous bulletin board.

786
00:58:32,926 --> 00:58:34,344
"Laid off"?

787
00:58:34,427 --> 00:58:37,680
Yes. Those in culinary, cleaning,
and parking will be sacked.

788
00:58:37,764 --> 00:58:39,182
They'll outsource the workers.

789
00:58:40,016 --> 00:58:41,518
I feel terrible for them.

790
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:44,354
Last year, they were made
full-time employees

791
00:58:44,437 --> 00:58:47,148
and even sent rice cakes
to all the departments.

792
00:58:48,024 --> 00:58:50,693
Hold on. There's more.

793
00:58:50,777 --> 00:58:54,405
What? Is there something else?

794
00:58:54,489 --> 00:58:57,116
Temporary workers
who were hired this year will

795
00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,868
have their contracts terminated.

796
00:58:59,786 --> 00:59:02,497
Does that mean Ms. Bahn will…

797
01:00:13,651 --> 01:00:14,902
Dad…

798
01:01:18,716 --> 01:01:21,928
Yu-hyeon, I'm…

799
01:01:22,011 --> 01:01:25,098
Why isn't Dad coming to visit Grandma?
Is he that busy?

800
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:27,183
I should go visit your dad.

801
01:01:29,102 --> 01:01:31,312
He's finally back at the top again.

802
01:01:31,396 --> 01:01:34,232
Here's the proposal for
our consumer compensation plan.

803
01:01:34,315 --> 01:01:35,900
Old lady!

804
01:01:35,983 --> 01:01:38,695
How do you know Yu-hyeon?

805
01:01:39,404 --> 01:01:42,865
Isn't that man with the chairman his son?

806
01:01:43,491 --> 01:01:46,619
I didn't even know who he really was.

807
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:50,707
