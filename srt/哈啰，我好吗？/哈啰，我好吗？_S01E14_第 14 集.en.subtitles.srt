EPISODE 14

2
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:16,993
JOA CONFECTIONERY

3
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:22,123
PERSONNEL RESTRUCTURING PROPOSAL

4
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,835
We'll now begin the voting process
for the personnel restructuring

5
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,378
that's been added to the agenda.

6
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:42,519
I vote against…

7
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:47,023
the restructuring.

8
00:01:52,904 --> 00:01:53,822
What?

9
00:01:55,782 --> 00:01:57,742
How dare you interrupt this meeting.

10
00:01:58,326 --> 00:02:01,579
Chairman Han Ji-man would never agree
to such a disgraceful decision

11
00:02:01,663 --> 00:02:04,332
that'll result in the employees
being forcibly pushed out

12
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,210
just for the sake of cost-cutting.

13
00:02:10,880 --> 00:02:12,090
Being the chairman's son

14
00:02:12,173 --> 00:02:14,759
doesn't give you the right
to cause mayhem at a meeting.

15
00:02:16,928 --> 00:02:19,389
Don't just stand there and escort him out.

16
00:02:32,360 --> 00:02:34,571
-Chairman Han?
-Sir?

17
00:02:42,203 --> 00:02:45,748
That'll be all for today's board meeting.

18
00:02:49,961 --> 00:02:51,963
You're all dismissed.

19
00:03:19,115 --> 00:03:20,033
Here you go.

20
00:03:23,703 --> 00:03:26,205
Here's the proposal for
our consumer compensation plan.

21
00:03:26,289 --> 00:03:29,459
We'll proceed once you approve.

22
00:03:30,668 --> 00:03:31,669
Sure.

23
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:35,506
I'll go over the details with Mr. Kim

24
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:37,383
and sign the document.

25
00:03:37,467 --> 00:03:39,427
You should head back to the office first.

26
00:03:40,428 --> 00:03:41,429
Sure.

27
00:03:45,266 --> 00:03:46,434
I'll get going then.

28
00:03:56,194 --> 00:03:58,821
Tell me what's in this envelope.

29
00:04:03,826 --> 00:04:05,954
TRANSFER OF SHARES

30
00:04:06,537 --> 00:04:09,415
You'll be transferring
all your shares to Director Yang.

31
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,671
I see.

32
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:19,133
Do-yun probably had no other choice.

33
00:04:20,134 --> 00:04:23,638
He couldn't possibly
make an enemy out of his mom.

34
00:04:58,673 --> 00:05:00,425
What the hell is going on?

35
00:05:00,925 --> 00:05:02,135
What are you doing here?

36
00:05:05,388 --> 00:05:06,514
Damn it.

37
00:05:06,597 --> 00:05:09,392
You're supposed to be on a business trip.
Why are you here?

38
00:05:10,226 --> 00:05:12,729
I knew you weren't
taking my calls for a reason.

39
00:05:13,229 --> 00:05:15,273
-You wanted to rest this badly?
-You…

40
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,775
Why on earth are you here?

41
00:05:18,443 --> 00:05:20,903
-How did you know?
-I didn't want to get fired.

42
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:22,655
Are you restructuring the company

43
00:05:22,739 --> 00:05:25,366
because I'm close to paying back the debt?

44
00:05:26,367 --> 00:05:28,745
Restructuring? What are you talking about?

45
00:05:28,828 --> 00:05:32,540
The company took a weird turn
ever since you went away on a break.

46
00:05:32,623 --> 00:05:34,042
You can't fire me, you know.

47
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,752
You're not making any sense.

48
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:38,963
Restructuring? That's absurd.

49
00:05:39,047 --> 00:05:42,133
This look doesn't suit you at all,
so let's head back to the office.

50
00:06:00,485 --> 00:06:01,778
Yu-hyeon.

51
00:06:04,113 --> 00:06:07,909
I'm afraid my eyes--

52
00:06:07,992 --> 00:06:09,202
I know!

53
00:06:11,913 --> 00:06:14,290
So what if you have poor vision?

54
00:06:16,334 --> 00:06:17,877
You have me, you know.

55
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:22,173
This is when you should make use
of your healthy son,

56
00:06:22,256 --> 00:06:23,591
Han Yu-hyeon.

57
00:07:26,154 --> 00:07:27,238
Ji-suk.

58
00:07:28,281 --> 00:07:30,825
You're done
running the show as you please.

59
00:07:31,617 --> 00:07:32,452
No.

60
00:07:33,828 --> 00:07:34,912
You're wrong.

61
00:07:36,164 --> 00:07:40,835
I'm willing to do anything it takes
for Joa Confectionery.

62
00:07:41,419 --> 00:07:45,339
And what you see as
the best option for the company

63
00:07:46,674 --> 00:07:49,635
is firing our hard-working employees?

64
00:07:50,887 --> 00:07:55,016
They are also the rightful owners
of this company as much as we are.

65
00:07:55,099 --> 00:07:56,058
Rightful owners?

66
00:07:58,186 --> 00:08:00,480
It's your unrealistic ideals

67
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:01,981
that made you this way.

68
00:08:02,607 --> 00:08:04,817
This is a company we're running.

69
00:08:04,901 --> 00:08:10,448
Our job is to increase sales and profit
for our shareholders.

70
00:08:11,032 --> 00:08:12,575
What's so bad about

71
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:15,912
They're just replaceable cogs
in the corporate machine.

72
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:18,164
What's wrong with firing them?

73
00:08:27,131 --> 00:08:31,636
For the first time,
I'm glad to have lost my vision.

74
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:37,600
At least I don't have to actually see
the monster you've turned into.

75
00:08:51,447 --> 00:08:53,115
How the hell did this happen?

76
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,452
How did he turn up here with Yu-hyeon?

77
00:08:56,536 --> 00:08:59,539
When the hell did his secretary
switch sides again?

78
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:02,083
-Please calm down.
-Calm down?

79
00:09:03,125 --> 00:09:04,752
You told me to do better,

80
00:09:04,835 --> 00:09:06,921
but what have you done to help?

81
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:08,923
How did you let it get this far?

82
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:12,510
-It's actually better this way.
-What?

83
00:09:12,593 --> 00:09:15,972
Both sides will fight
with all cards on the table.

84
00:09:16,055 --> 00:09:18,224
There was a limit to your method anyway.

85
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:22,478
Did you really believe that you could

86
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:25,773
take over a company of this size
with lies and tricks?

87
00:09:25,856 --> 00:09:27,858
Are you blaming me for what happened?

88
00:09:29,402 --> 00:09:30,403
Of course not.

89
00:09:30,987 --> 00:09:33,281
All I'm saying is
that our fight has started now.

90
00:09:34,282 --> 00:09:35,658
Officially, this time.

91
00:09:44,542 --> 00:09:46,544
Have you been under
a lot of stress lately?

92
00:09:47,545 --> 00:09:50,548
Yes, there were some incidents.

93
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,509
Is there perhaps an issue?

94
00:09:54,594 --> 00:09:57,680
The fetus is smaller
than the average size.

95
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,771
Then, what should I do?

96
00:10:06,272 --> 00:10:09,525
Please be wary not to stress yourself

97
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,485
and try to relax.

98
00:10:12,028 --> 00:10:15,615
The baby can only be happy
if the mother is.

99
00:10:17,992 --> 00:10:18,993
Right.

100
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:20,911
OBGYN CLINIC

101
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:23,497
Isn't it fascinating?

102
00:10:23,581 --> 00:10:24,832
-I see its hands.
-Where?

103
00:10:24,915 --> 00:10:26,834
-Right here.
-Are these the hands?

104
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:29,045
-Yes.
-I see. How fascinating.

105
00:10:29,795 --> 00:10:32,006
The sharp nose must take after yours.

106
00:10:32,089 --> 00:10:33,007
-You think?
-Yes.

107
00:10:33,090 --> 00:10:34,133
It's more like yours.

108
00:10:47,188 --> 00:10:48,814
Don't worry, Ms. Bahn.

109
00:10:50,358 --> 00:10:51,192
Sorry?

110
00:10:51,275 --> 00:10:53,527
It's probably just a groundless rumor.

111
00:10:53,611 --> 00:10:56,364
The company can't fire you for no reason

112
00:10:56,447 --> 00:10:58,115
while your contract is valid.

113
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,118
Right. Thank you for saying that.

114
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,203
Sure.

115
00:11:03,579 --> 00:11:06,248
I just don't feel like
coming to work these days.

116
00:11:07,291 --> 00:11:09,377
What's gotten into you all?

117
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:11,837
We should all try to hang in there.

118
00:11:13,589 --> 00:11:15,299
Let's go grab some lunch.

119
00:11:15,383 --> 00:11:17,718
Maybe that'll give us a surge of energy.

120
00:11:17,802 --> 00:11:19,011
Sure, let's go.

121
00:11:19,095 --> 00:11:21,931
By the way, Ok-ju's been away
from her desk for a while.

122
00:11:22,681 --> 00:11:24,642
She went to a friend of hers in HR

123
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:26,685
to ask about Ha-ni's contract.

124
00:11:26,769 --> 00:11:28,521
Just in case there is a way.

125
00:11:29,730 --> 00:11:31,524
Big news, guys!

126
00:11:32,149 --> 00:11:33,734
What's the fuss about?

127
00:11:33,818 --> 00:11:36,237
The restructuring was scrapped…

128
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:38,864
I mean, it was taken off
the table completely.

129
00:11:40,699 --> 00:11:41,659
Why all of a sudden?

130
00:11:41,742 --> 00:11:43,786
The board was going to approve it,

131
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:47,873
but the chairman's son made an entrance
along with the chairman himself

132
00:11:47,957 --> 00:11:50,292
-and canceled the vote.
-Hold on a second.

133
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:53,921
The chairman's son? I thought he wasn't
interested in the company.

134
00:11:56,507 --> 00:12:00,094
Isn't that man with the chairman his son?

135
00:12:02,763 --> 00:12:06,058
Hold on. Isn't that
one of the kitchen employees?

136
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:08,853
Yes, it is.
The one who made the tteokbokki!

137
00:12:12,606 --> 00:12:14,984
-What?
-No way. Seriously?

138
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:16,152
What the hell?

139
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,362
Come on. Let's take a look.

140
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:31,125
Even if I don't turn out to be
who you thought I was,

141
00:12:31,208 --> 00:12:32,877
don't be too shocked.

142
00:12:36,297 --> 00:12:37,548
-What?
-Let's go.

143
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:56,275
Thanks.
I've been an immature brat all this time,

144
00:12:57,318 --> 00:12:59,528
but you and Aunt
taught me about the real world.

145
00:13:01,947 --> 00:13:03,199
I'm glad to have helped.

146
00:13:11,081 --> 00:13:11,999
Do-yun.

147
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:16,170
-I'm back from the ob-gyn.
-We'll talk later.

148
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:42,029
I see you really had no idea
about who Yu-hyeon is.

149
00:13:42,738 --> 00:13:44,114
No.

150
00:13:45,699 --> 00:13:48,536
I didn't know you were part
of his extended family either.

151
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,080
So tell me.

152
00:13:52,206 --> 00:13:55,042
How do you know Yu-hyeon?

153
00:13:56,085 --> 00:13:58,587
You even entered the contest together,

154
00:13:58,671 --> 00:14:01,674
so it didn't seem like
you were just acquaintances.

155
00:14:04,760 --> 00:14:06,762
He was someone that I was thankful for,

156
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,640
made me get butterflies,

157
00:14:10,724 --> 00:14:13,811
and someone I could lean on at times.

158
00:14:16,188 --> 00:14:17,773
But I don't know anymore.

159
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,152
I didn't even know who he really was.

160
00:14:26,991 --> 00:14:29,994
This revelation must have upset you.

161
00:14:33,622 --> 00:14:34,748
So…

162
00:14:35,457 --> 00:14:38,919
what exactly is going on at the company?

163
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:43,883
I'd love

164
00:14:44,633 --> 00:14:49,305
nothing more than to tell you
everything that's been going on.

165
00:14:49,889 --> 00:14:50,931
But…

166
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,268
I can't since it's also a family matter.

167
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,813
Right, of course.

168
00:14:57,897 --> 00:15:00,107
I don't know what to do either.

169
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,068
I'm frustrated

170
00:15:03,986 --> 00:15:05,070
and heartbroken.

171
00:15:05,154 --> 00:15:07,072
But you need to regain your strength.

172
00:15:08,908 --> 00:15:10,284
For your baby's sake, right?

173
00:15:16,707 --> 00:15:18,792
Ha-ni, do you remember

174
00:15:19,543 --> 00:15:22,504
what we used to do to blow off steam

175
00:15:23,339 --> 00:15:26,133
whenever life got too frustrating?

176
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:32,097
How about a short round
after we get off work?

177
00:15:32,181 --> 00:15:33,557
What?

178
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:41,482
-Your love is what I only need to be happy
-Your love is what I only need to be happy

179
00:15:42,858 --> 00:15:45,110
-Always…
-Always…

180
00:16:15,307 --> 00:16:16,308
Here.

181
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,144
Gosh, it's so good.

182
00:16:29,405 --> 00:16:30,489
It's so good.

183
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:36,120
I had no idea I'd be back here with you.

184
00:16:36,203 --> 00:16:38,455
Tell me about it. This is great.

185
00:16:38,539 --> 00:16:41,500
-Isn't it delicious?
-It sure is.

186
00:16:41,583 --> 00:16:44,586
-Should we buy some to-go?
-Why not?

187
00:16:47,923 --> 00:16:49,216
You have some on your face.

188
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,896
Old lady!

189
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:35,345
Are you back from work?

190
00:17:35,429 --> 00:17:37,806
Yes. And you?

191
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,684
You're not giving Mom and Ha-yeong
a hard time, right?

192
00:17:41,351 --> 00:17:42,936
Of course not.

193
00:17:43,020 --> 00:17:45,647
This place is really nice.

194
00:17:45,731 --> 00:17:47,858
The house is huge, and Mom…

195
00:17:50,110 --> 00:17:51,695
She cooks me delicious food.

196
00:17:53,113 --> 00:17:56,033
And I got myself a minion.

197
00:17:58,869 --> 00:18:00,245
Thank you.

198
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,873
I'm doing well, so don't worry.

199
00:18:02,956 --> 00:18:05,334
Just come visit when you have time.

200
00:18:06,001 --> 00:18:07,044
Okay.

201
00:18:11,215 --> 00:18:12,341
I'm home.

202
00:18:17,012 --> 00:18:18,347
Hey, Ha-yeong.

203
00:18:19,306 --> 00:18:20,766
Hey, Mom.

204
00:18:24,812 --> 00:18:26,105
Stop calling me by my name.

205
00:18:27,231 --> 00:18:28,732
Do you want some sweet potatoes?

206
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:32,694
No, you can have them all.

207
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:44,039
YU-HYEON, IS SOMETHING WRONG?
YOU'RE WORRYING ME, SO PLEASE REPLY

208
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,476
I'M RELIEVED TO SEE YOU'RE DOING WELL

209
00:19:23,245 --> 00:19:24,204
Who is it?

210
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:26,582
It's me.

211
00:19:28,750 --> 00:19:29,751
Yu-hyeon?

212
00:19:43,724 --> 00:19:45,475
It's cold outside.

213
00:19:54,818 --> 00:19:55,903
I feel so much better.

214
00:20:01,533 --> 00:20:04,369
It's freezing outside, isn't it?

215
00:20:05,495 --> 00:20:06,413
No.

216
00:20:07,206 --> 00:20:08,957
I feel better now that I'm with you.

217
00:20:17,841 --> 00:20:19,343
Are you kidding me?

218
00:20:20,719 --> 00:20:23,639
I was so worried
because you didn't contact me for a week.

219
00:20:23,722 --> 00:20:25,182
And you ignored me earlier today.

220
00:20:25,265 --> 00:20:26,558
Why did you lie to me?

221
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,187
Do you think I'm a joke?
Do you think I'm that dumb?

222
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,612
I'm sorry for worrying you.

223
00:20:40,489 --> 00:20:42,699
No, it's just that--

224
00:20:42,783 --> 00:20:44,785
So many things happened.

225
00:20:47,788 --> 00:20:49,665
They were too much for me to handle.

226
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:54,253
So I needed time to organize my thoughts.

227
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,630
What happened?

228
00:20:57,881 --> 00:21:01,051
I was hurt by those
who I trusted the most.

229
00:21:02,636 --> 00:21:07,057
And it took me so long to notice the scars
of the person I loved the most.

230
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:11,478
So I felt miserable and distressed.

231
00:21:12,646 --> 00:21:13,939
And I thought of you

232
00:21:15,232 --> 00:21:17,234
every time I felt that way.

233
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:23,448
But still,
you could've at least texted me.

234
00:21:24,741 --> 00:21:26,326
I felt like that'd make me

235
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,288
run over here to see you.

236
00:21:40,841 --> 00:21:42,342
I have so much to tell you.

237
00:21:44,928 --> 00:21:49,016
And there will come a day
when I'm ready to tell you everything.

238
00:21:52,769 --> 00:21:54,896
But for now, I should go.

239
00:21:57,107 --> 00:21:59,901
By the way, where's the kid?

240
00:22:01,111 --> 00:22:02,237
Is everything okay?

241
00:22:03,947 --> 00:22:05,866
I also have a lot to tell you.

242
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:08,327
But it can wait.

243
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:11,788
She's staying at my sister's place,

244
00:22:11,872 --> 00:22:13,457
so you don't need to worry.

245
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:20,047
I'm sorry I wasn't there for you guys.

246
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:22,632
No, I'm the one who's sorry.

247
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:27,054
I'm sorry I can't be of any help

248
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:29,806
when you're going through so much.

249
00:22:32,142 --> 00:22:33,143
No, it's okay.

250
00:22:33,894 --> 00:22:37,314
I feel a lot better
now that I've seen you.

251
00:22:49,743 --> 00:22:50,786
Do-yun.

252
00:22:54,581 --> 00:22:57,334
Can we talk for a moment?

253
00:22:58,752 --> 00:23:00,212
Can it wait if it isn't urgent?

254
00:23:02,172 --> 00:23:07,094
We haven't talked to each other
for a really long time.

255
00:23:07,928 --> 00:23:09,513
You know how things are at work.

256
00:23:12,891 --> 00:23:14,935
Do-yun, I'm not stupid.

257
00:23:16,019 --> 00:23:17,854
I can tell there's something wrong

258
00:23:18,855 --> 00:23:23,110
with our relationship
as well as the relationship

259
00:23:24,152 --> 00:23:28,532
between your mother, the chairman,
and Yu-hyeon.

260
00:23:30,242 --> 00:23:33,078
What is it that you want to say?

261
00:23:34,746 --> 00:23:35,831
To be honest…

262
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,417
I'm really scared

263
00:23:40,836 --> 00:23:42,671
that everything might go wrong.

264
00:23:46,341 --> 00:23:48,927
You're the only person I can rely on,

265
00:23:49,553 --> 00:23:52,806
but you're like
a different person these days.

266
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:13,118
Dad, what are you thinking about?

267
00:24:15,537 --> 00:24:17,122
Now that I'm blind,

268
00:24:17,706 --> 00:24:21,585
I've become more aware of the things
that I haven't been able to notice.

269
00:24:23,503 --> 00:24:26,965
I was so pathetic and foolish.

270
00:24:29,634 --> 00:24:31,261
A person I know

271
00:24:32,470 --> 00:24:34,264
once said this to me.

272
00:24:35,223 --> 00:24:38,101
I thought I'd be an amazing person

273
00:24:38,685 --> 00:24:41,354
when I grew up.

274
00:24:41,855 --> 00:24:44,566
But now that I've become one,

275
00:24:45,442 --> 00:24:49,446
I'm still foolish and clumsy.

276
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:55,160
I'm a mess.

277
00:24:58,038 --> 00:25:00,874
People who know how to look back
on themselves

278
00:25:01,958 --> 00:25:06,338
can't be foolish and clumsy.

279
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:09,925
I'm sure that person is very wise.

280
00:25:11,051 --> 00:25:13,136
See? You just said it yourself.

281
00:25:13,220 --> 00:25:16,973
That proves that you're also not
pathetic and foolish.

282
00:25:17,057 --> 00:25:20,143
Among all the old men I know,
you're the best.

283
00:25:20,227 --> 00:25:21,394
You're amazing.

284
00:25:25,232 --> 00:25:26,233
You punk.

285
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:29,319
Did that lady make you grow up?

286
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:32,113
Yes.

287
00:25:32,697 --> 00:25:37,327
She somehow makes me want to be
a better person.

288
00:25:39,871 --> 00:25:41,081
I see.

289
00:25:47,504 --> 00:25:50,548
-Sir.
-What is it?

290
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,051
Ms. Han asked for
a general stockholders' meeting

291
00:25:53,134 --> 00:25:54,803
to discuss your dismissal.

292
00:25:56,346 --> 00:25:59,307
I can't say I didn't see this coming.

293
00:26:00,267 --> 00:26:02,936
-How is the situation?
-We're at a disadvantage.

294
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:06,106
Shouldn't we also take action?

295
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:10,860
Let's talk about that later.

296
00:26:11,987 --> 00:26:14,698
Mr. Kim, can we talk in private?

297
00:26:19,119 --> 00:26:20,745
Can you tell me what's going on?

298
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:25,792
If the stockholders vote in favor
of the chairman's dismissal,

299
00:26:25,875 --> 00:26:28,336
the chairman will have no choice
but to step down.

300
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:32,549
Is there any way to stop it?

301
00:26:32,632 --> 00:26:35,427
The only way is to have the stockholders
reject the dismissal.

302
00:26:35,510 --> 00:26:37,137
But Ms. Han and her supporters

303
00:26:37,220 --> 00:26:39,806
have six percent more shares
than the people on our side.

304
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:42,684
Then is there a way for us
to acquire more shares?

305
00:26:44,853 --> 00:26:48,315
The major stockholders and organizations
are already supporting Ms. Han.

306
00:26:49,107 --> 00:26:51,609
So is there no way to fight back?

307
00:26:52,277 --> 00:26:55,864
We have the minority stockholders,
but there's not enough of them.

308
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:25,018
-Grandma.
-Eat up.

309
00:27:26,478 --> 00:27:30,231
Ok-jeong, why didn't you
cook something better for our guest?

310
00:27:31,691 --> 00:27:35,487
Mother, she's Ha-ni.

311
00:27:35,570 --> 00:27:37,322
What are you talking about?

312
00:27:38,198 --> 00:27:40,575
My puppy is right here.

313
00:27:41,701 --> 00:27:43,578
-Goodness, Mother.
-Mom.

314
00:27:44,412 --> 00:27:46,456
-Just let her be.
-Grandma.

315
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:49,542
Then can I also have some more meat?

316
00:27:49,626 --> 00:27:52,087
Goodness, you're just like me.

317
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:55,924
You really know
how to make people like you.

318
00:28:08,311 --> 00:28:09,687
My son.

319
00:28:13,817 --> 00:28:15,110
Let's talk in your room.

320
00:28:31,084 --> 00:28:33,878
Seong-u, what did I tell you?

321
00:28:33,962 --> 00:28:35,964
I told you not to show interest in her.

322
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:37,882
I'm sorry, Mom.

323
00:28:39,843 --> 00:28:42,971
For the first time in my life,
I can't do what you ask.

324
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,223
-Seong-u.
-Nietzsche, the great philosopher,

325
00:28:45,306 --> 00:28:48,518
and Rilke, the poet, were able to become
better at what they do

326
00:28:48,601 --> 00:28:50,353
because they were both in love
with Lou Andreas-Salomé.

327
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:53,189
And the genius painter, Salvador Dali,
was able to paint his works

328
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:55,108
thanks to his muse, Gala.

329
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:57,944
So why am I not allowed to love Scarlett?

330
00:28:58,778 --> 00:29:00,405
-"Love"?
-That's right.

331
00:29:00,947 --> 00:29:02,907
I'm in love with Scarlett.

332
00:29:06,369 --> 00:29:07,412
"Love"?

333
00:29:07,495 --> 00:29:09,164
You darn punk!

334
00:29:09,247 --> 00:29:12,917
Do you even know who she is?

335
00:29:13,001 --> 00:29:17,046
How dare you speak such nonsense?

336
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:18,882
Mom, calm down.

337
00:29:18,965 --> 00:29:21,134
How do you expect me to calm down?
Come here!

338
00:29:21,217 --> 00:29:24,012
You have the worst taste in women

339
00:29:24,095 --> 00:29:26,431
just like your father.

340
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:30,643
We should just end our lives here and now!

341
00:29:31,603 --> 00:29:33,229
You're going to put your guard up?

342
00:29:33,855 --> 00:29:35,315
Come here, you punk.

343
00:29:35,398 --> 00:29:37,150
Why can't she just talk to him?

344
00:29:37,233 --> 00:29:39,027
Why does she have to hit him?

345
00:29:39,903 --> 00:29:42,405
You also used to hit me
instead of talking to me.

346
00:29:42,489 --> 00:29:44,032
What am I going to do with you?

347
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:46,367
-Just clean the table.
-What am I going to do?

348
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,037
Am I sensing a little embarrassment?

349
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:50,205
Cut it out.

350
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:56,377
Why isn't Dad coming to visit Grandma?

351
00:29:56,461 --> 00:29:57,754
Is he that busy?

352
00:30:00,924 --> 00:30:03,843
I think he's too busy
to think about any of us.

353
00:30:05,261 --> 00:30:07,555
You guys always say he's busy.

354
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,849
But if he's there all alone,
how will he eat?

355
00:30:11,226 --> 00:30:13,812
He's old enough to cook for himself.

356
00:30:13,895 --> 00:30:15,605
You won't even let me call him.

357
00:30:15,688 --> 00:30:17,690
Daejeon isn't even that far from here.

358
00:30:17,774 --> 00:30:20,693
But you always talk as if he can't come
because he lives too far.

359
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:24,072
Hey, he's just busy, okay?
Stop nitpicking.

360
00:30:24,614 --> 00:30:27,826
Mom, do you want me
to help you wash the dishes?

361
00:30:27,909 --> 00:30:30,119
-Sure.
-Okay. Either come and help

362
00:30:30,203 --> 00:30:31,412
or just go inside.

363
00:30:32,872 --> 00:30:35,959
I bet Dad would be thrilled to see me.

364
00:30:42,966 --> 00:30:44,050
Of course.

365
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:48,304
He would've been extremely happy.

366
00:30:49,597 --> 00:30:50,682
Mom.

367
00:30:54,102 --> 00:30:55,895
I should go visit your dad

368
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:58,231
while Ha-yeong's home.

369
00:30:58,314 --> 00:30:59,858
I haven't seen him in a while.

370
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:02,527
Okay.

371
00:31:17,458 --> 00:31:20,962
There's so much going on with the company
that I can't focus on work.

372
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:25,425
Do you think the chairman
will really get dismissed

373
00:31:25,508 --> 00:31:28,177
if Ms. Han wins the vote
at the stockholders' meeting?

374
00:31:28,261 --> 00:31:32,140
If the stockholders vote in favor
of his dismissal, he won't have a choice.

375
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:35,518
But if that happens,
it won't just end with the chairman--

376
00:31:35,602 --> 00:31:36,978
Of course not.

377
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:41,399
-We might lose our jobs too.
-Us too?

378
00:31:41,482 --> 00:31:44,027
The private equity firm
that supports Ms. Han

379
00:31:44,110 --> 00:31:45,987
is famous for being a corporate raider.

380
00:31:46,070 --> 00:31:47,822
Once they take over a company,

381
00:31:47,906 --> 00:31:50,658
they lay off a bunch of employees
to make it seem like

382
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:52,869
things are more financially stable--

383
00:31:52,952 --> 00:31:55,038
Then they sell the company.

384
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,124
-That's their tactic.
-Exactly.

385
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,876
What are we going to do?

386
00:32:14,140 --> 00:32:16,476
-Hey, Ha-ni.
-Yu-hyeon.

387
00:32:16,559 --> 00:32:20,188
By any chance,
is there anything I can do to help?

388
00:32:21,189 --> 00:32:23,107
You really are Superman.

389
00:32:23,733 --> 00:32:25,902
-Do you have supernatural powers?
-What?

390
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:28,780
How did you know I needed help?

391
00:32:29,906 --> 00:32:32,784
-I just figured.
-See? You do have super powers.

392
00:32:33,368 --> 00:32:36,788
Then can you come down to the cafeteria?

393
00:32:37,747 --> 00:32:39,749
Shouldn't we do something to help?

394
00:32:40,917 --> 00:32:43,920
Yes, we should do something
to protect the company and our jobs.

395
00:32:45,463 --> 00:32:46,673
But…

396
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:52,428
Yes, it's not easy to take action
considering Ms. Oh's position

397
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:53,805
in the company.

398
00:32:59,185 --> 00:33:01,938
If you think it's the right thing to do,

399
00:33:03,231 --> 00:33:04,232
you should do it.

400
00:33:05,274 --> 00:33:08,236
I may not be able to help,

401
00:33:09,737 --> 00:33:13,866
but I'm always going to support
your opinions.

402
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,370
So don't worry about me.

403
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:21,124
Just do what you want to do.

404
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:27,588
Why did you gather us? I mean…

405
00:33:27,672 --> 00:33:29,132
Why did you gather us, sir?

406
00:33:29,716 --> 00:33:31,509
Just treat me comfortably.

407
00:33:31,592 --> 00:33:33,011
You used to call me "Dummy."

408
00:33:33,094 --> 00:33:36,681
That's because I didn't know
you were the chairman's son.

409
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,809
Then call me "Newbie."

410
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:41,686
I like that nickname the best.

411
00:33:41,769 --> 00:33:44,856
Is that really okay with you, Newbie?

412
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:45,898
Yes.

413
00:33:47,233 --> 00:33:48,693
-Yu-hyeon.
-Hey.

414
00:33:50,862 --> 00:33:53,448
-Thank you, Seung-seok
-Of course, I should help.

415
00:33:53,531 --> 00:33:54,449
It's for you.

416
00:33:55,074 --> 00:33:56,492
What is all this?

417
00:33:57,285 --> 00:34:00,329
This is a list
of all the minority stockholders.

418
00:34:01,414 --> 00:34:03,291
What are we going to do with this?

419
00:34:03,374 --> 00:34:05,793
There will be a vote
at the stockholders' meeting.

420
00:34:05,877 --> 00:34:07,962
We'll have to convince
the other stockholders

421
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,964
aside from those who support Ms. Han.

422
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:13,885
Gosh, do you really think this will help?

423
00:34:13,968 --> 00:34:15,094
Let's give it a try.

424
00:34:15,762 --> 00:34:19,557
It's better to do something
than to do nothing and get fired.

425
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:21,934
This is regarding all of us now.

426
00:34:22,018 --> 00:34:23,895
-Okay, let's do it.
-Let's give it a try.

427
00:34:23,978 --> 00:34:24,896
Yu-hyeon.

428
00:34:31,319 --> 00:34:32,153
Hello.

429
00:34:32,236 --> 00:34:34,781
-Hello.
-What's going on?

430
00:34:34,864 --> 00:34:36,532
Why don't you hear them out yourself?

431
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:42,622
I grew up eating our company's snacks,

432
00:34:42,705 --> 00:34:44,499
so it was always my dream to work here.

433
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,251
I started my youth here,

434
00:34:47,919 --> 00:34:50,004
so I want to protect the company.

435
00:34:50,797 --> 00:34:53,382
My daughter's favorite snack

436
00:34:53,466 --> 00:34:56,511
is the first snack I made
after I got a job here.

437
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:59,180
I'm pretty much the owner of this company,

438
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:01,724
so I can't just sit back and do nothing.

439
00:35:03,059 --> 00:35:07,438
The thing is, my nephews really love me.

440
00:35:09,023 --> 00:35:10,942
After I told them I work
at a confectionary company,

441
00:35:11,025 --> 00:35:13,152
they began treating me
as if I'm Santa Claus.

442
00:35:16,531 --> 00:35:19,158
In order to maintain this popularity,

443
00:35:19,242 --> 00:35:22,787
I'm going to bury my bones here.

444
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:32,296
-Shall we recite our chant and go?
-Okay.

445
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,507
-Snacks for 3-year-olds…
-To 80-year-olds.

446
00:35:34,590 --> 00:35:36,926
-Joa is the best!
-Joa is the best!

447
00:35:37,009 --> 00:35:39,428
-Let's do this!
-Joa!

448
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:44,892
By transferring your stocks,
you'll be giving us your voting right.

449
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:46,936
Please help us.

450
00:35:48,146 --> 00:35:49,856
Please, sir.

451
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:53,401
-Just sign it. It's not much anyway.
-I'll do it, then.

452
00:35:53,484 --> 00:35:54,694
POWER OF ATTORNEY

453
00:35:54,777 --> 00:35:56,404
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

454
00:35:56,487 --> 00:35:58,030
-Take this.
-Okay,.

455
00:35:59,240 --> 00:36:00,741
-Enjoy.
-Okay.

456
00:36:00,825 --> 00:36:02,743
-Here you go.
-One minute.

457
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,747
-Goodbye.
-Bye.

458
00:36:20,469 --> 00:36:22,763
-Gosh, you have such great hair.
-Ma'am.

459
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,724
You're all working so hard.

460
00:36:24,807 --> 00:36:28,269
Ma'am, please. Just this once.

461
00:36:28,352 --> 00:36:29,979
-Just this once, please.
-All right.

462
00:36:30,563 --> 00:36:32,440
Yes! Thank you.

463
00:36:34,317 --> 00:36:36,235
-Over there.
-Be quiet.

464
00:36:36,319 --> 00:36:38,571
-That won't work.
-He'll lose.

465
00:36:39,655 --> 00:36:40,781
Gosh!

466
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:44,410
I won.

467
00:36:48,122 --> 00:36:49,832
Hey.

468
00:36:56,005 --> 00:36:57,173
-Joa!
-Joa!

469
00:36:58,591 --> 00:36:59,675
Done.

470
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,093
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

471
00:37:05,431 --> 00:37:08,851
How dare they go around convincing
the shareholders to oppose

472
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,311
the chairman's dismissal?

473
00:37:10,937 --> 00:37:12,271
What the hell are they doing?

474
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:16,150
Unlike Uncle, I guess you've failed
to win the employees' hearts.

475
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:18,986
There you go again!
Are you seriously blaming me for this?

476
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,571
Don't worry.

477
00:37:20,655 --> 00:37:23,741
I'll meet with our shareholders
and make sure they're not swayed.

478
00:37:28,454 --> 00:37:30,790
Despite all this,
what if they turn the tide?

479
00:37:33,626 --> 00:37:34,627
What will you do then?

480
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,755
That will never happen.

481
00:37:39,048 --> 00:37:42,260
Those puny shares won't change anything.

482
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:45,763
They may try,
but they won't get their way.

483
00:37:47,098 --> 00:37:49,892
After all the effort I've put into this…

484
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:51,018
"Turn the tide"?

485
00:37:52,770 --> 00:37:54,355
Not on my watch.

486
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,733
You're right.

487
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,860
They won't get their way.

488
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:33,978
What's wrong?

489
00:38:37,606 --> 00:38:39,775
I'm just so grateful.

490
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:45,906
At first, I was determined
to make this work no matter what,

491
00:38:47,742 --> 00:38:49,493
but I wasn't so sure I could.

492
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,496
I was lonely and afraid.

493
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:55,708
But they're all rooting for me now.

494
00:38:56,375 --> 00:38:58,085
How could I repay their kindness?

495
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,546
There's no need for that.

496
00:39:00,629 --> 00:39:02,673
We didn't do this to help you.

497
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,926
We all just want to protect
Joa Confectionery.

498
00:39:07,636 --> 00:39:11,474
For some, this is their workplace
where they make money.

499
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:16,020
For others, Joa Confectionery's snacks
are like precious memories.

500
00:39:21,108 --> 00:39:23,069
I think I finally understand

501
00:39:24,695 --> 00:39:25,529
why my dad

502
00:39:26,906 --> 00:39:28,491
loved his company.

503
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,652
Today's the first shooting
of Ms. Kim's drama.

504
00:40:06,695 --> 00:40:08,364
I must look the best. Ready?

505
00:40:08,447 --> 00:40:09,740
I was born ready.

506
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:20,251
Today will be the best day of his life.

507
00:40:20,334 --> 00:40:22,211
You're right. Ever since he was cast,

508
00:40:22,294 --> 00:40:25,089
everyone's been talking about him
on their social media.

509
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:27,383
He's finally back at the top again.

510
00:40:27,466 --> 00:40:28,467
You got that right.

511
00:40:31,554 --> 00:40:33,055
Looking good.

512
00:40:36,142 --> 00:40:37,351
Good.

513
00:40:37,435 --> 00:40:40,813
-I loved you
-Gosh.

514
00:40:41,564 --> 00:40:43,441
Anthony, you're looking great.

515
00:40:43,524 --> 00:40:45,568
You look amazing like you were
in your heyday.

516
00:40:45,651 --> 00:40:46,944
-Jeong-man.
-Yes?

517
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:48,154
I'm still in my heyday.

518
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:55,327
What lovely weather.

519
00:40:55,411 --> 00:40:56,745
It's the best.

520
00:40:59,415 --> 00:41:01,584
I can't believe this.

521
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:04,044
-Anthony.
-Yes, I'm listening.

522
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:08,007
You said you valued sincerity the most
as an actor,

523
00:41:08,090 --> 00:41:11,510
but there have been many suspicions
about you lying.

524
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:16,765
-Sorry?
-What do you mean?

525
00:41:16,849 --> 00:41:18,893
You've disguised yourself as a gentleman

526
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:20,394
who studied abroad.

527
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:23,439
However, you were kicked out of school
when you were young

528
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:25,774
for bullying other students.

529
00:41:28,402 --> 00:41:30,196
I think you got it all wrong.

530
00:41:31,197 --> 00:41:32,239
I've never done that.

531
00:41:32,323 --> 00:41:33,908
Yes, you have.

532
00:41:36,076 --> 00:41:37,411
I was that victim.

533
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,208
-Please move aside. Excuse us.
-Wait!

534
00:41:42,708 --> 00:41:44,627
-Chun-sik! Yang Chun-sik!
-Hold on!

535
00:41:48,506 --> 00:41:50,257
BEFORE AND AFTER SURGERY

536
00:41:51,133 --> 00:41:55,221
Chun-sik, it took me so many years
to confirm that it was really you.

537
00:41:55,846 --> 00:41:58,349
Thanks to your plastic surgeon
coming clean,

538
00:41:58,432 --> 00:41:59,850
I could finally find you.

539
00:42:00,726 --> 00:42:03,187
But it seems like…

540
00:42:05,105 --> 00:42:07,441
you don't even remember me at all.

541
00:42:08,567 --> 00:42:11,737
-Chun-sik.
-I'm sorry! We'll talk later!

542
00:42:11,820 --> 00:42:13,864
-We'll explain it all later!
-Yang Chun-sik!

543
00:42:13,948 --> 00:42:15,699
-We'll call you later!
-Wait!

544
00:42:15,783 --> 00:42:17,159
-Is it true?
-We'll talk again!

545
00:42:17,243 --> 00:42:18,827
Chun-sik!

546
00:42:18,911 --> 00:42:20,538
We'll call you again!

547
00:42:20,621 --> 00:42:22,248
We'll call later! I'm sorry!

548
00:42:22,331 --> 00:42:23,999
-We will!
-Chun-sik!

549
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:25,709
Next news.

550
00:42:25,793 --> 00:42:28,128
The news that the actor, Anthony,
used to be a bully

551
00:42:28,212 --> 00:42:30,130
has shocked the public.

552
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:32,591
-The reporter who exposed him,
-What's going on?

553
00:42:32,675 --> 00:42:34,635
-his former colleague,
-What is it?

554
00:42:34,718 --> 00:42:37,805
-claimed that he was also a victim.
-Do you know him?

555
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:39,014
-He also claimed
-Yes.

556
00:42:39,098 --> 00:42:41,517
that Anthony has had
plastic surgery to start anew,

557
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:45,020
using the before-surgery photo as proof,
shocking the public.

558
00:42:45,104 --> 00:42:50,234
Once this issue surfaced,
other victims have been posting online…

559
00:42:59,285 --> 00:43:02,454
Is our company cursed or what?

560
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:04,665
Issues keep popping up left and right.

561
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,959
What is it this time?

562
00:43:07,042 --> 00:43:08,627
I'm already terrified.

563
00:43:08,711 --> 00:43:12,590
You know that actor, Anthony?

564
00:43:12,673 --> 00:43:14,008
The model for Squid-good.

565
00:43:14,091 --> 00:43:17,469
He's in a scandal for having been a bully
during high school.

566
00:43:17,553 --> 00:43:18,596
"Anthony"?

567
00:43:18,679 --> 00:43:20,556
What? "Bullying"?

568
00:43:21,181 --> 00:43:24,643
How could a dirtbag like him
become a celebrity?

569
00:43:24,727 --> 00:43:26,854
Goodness. Look at his face.

570
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,608
He claimed not to have received surgery,
but he had actually done a 180.

571
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,235
What's wrong? What's all this fuss about?

572
00:43:33,319 --> 00:43:34,987
Ms. Oh, check this out.

573
00:43:35,070 --> 00:43:36,030
What?

574
00:43:36,530 --> 00:43:37,865
Goodness.

575
00:43:38,365 --> 00:43:40,159
Yang Chun-sik?

576
00:43:40,743 --> 00:43:43,871
Gosh. How did you know
Anthony's real name?

577
00:43:44,580 --> 00:43:47,041
Wait. Yang Chun-sik. Anthony.

578
00:43:51,378 --> 00:43:54,256
Gosh, we're going to be bombarded
with complaint calls.

579
00:43:55,257 --> 00:43:59,303
At this rate, shouldn't we be carrying out
an exorcism or something?

580
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,265
-The person you have called cannot…
-Come on.

581
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,101
He's not picking up.

582
00:44:06,185 --> 00:44:08,979
I can't believe Anthony was Yang Chun-sik.

583
00:44:12,316 --> 00:44:13,734
I'm so shocked.

584
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:15,611
I was also shocked to find out.

585
00:44:15,694 --> 00:44:20,491
We've finally managed to reunite
after 20 years.

586
00:44:21,325 --> 00:44:23,661
So why are we all suffering
from misfortunes?

587
00:44:26,830 --> 00:44:30,334
We all have no one to blame but ourselves.

588
00:44:30,918 --> 00:44:33,712
Both Chun-sik and me.

589
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,090
I didn't know this when I was young,

590
00:44:36,173 --> 00:44:37,591
but now I do.

591
00:44:39,218 --> 00:44:40,594
As an adult,

592
00:44:41,178 --> 00:44:44,306
you need to take responsibility
for your own life.

593
00:44:50,437 --> 00:44:51,313
What is it?

594
00:44:52,481 --> 00:44:53,565
Ha-ni.

595
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:57,736
You've grown into an amazing adult.

596
00:45:01,990 --> 00:45:04,993
I can't say the same about myself,

597
00:45:05,077 --> 00:45:08,664
but after surrounding myself with those
who believed that I was a good person,

598
00:45:09,998 --> 00:45:12,876
I did feel the desire to better myself.

599
00:45:17,089 --> 00:45:18,382
You're right.

600
00:45:19,091 --> 00:45:22,469
I have someone like that too.

601
00:45:28,851 --> 00:45:29,685
What is it?

602
00:45:29,768 --> 00:45:32,104
Did you see the news about Chun-sik?

603
00:45:32,187 --> 00:45:33,605
I know.

604
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,941
I've been calling him,
but he just won't pick up.

605
00:45:36,024 --> 00:45:37,818
Shouldn't you go see him?

606
00:45:37,901 --> 00:45:41,822
He may have a terrible temper,
but he's extremely soft on the inside.

607
00:45:42,823 --> 00:45:43,949
Should I go?

608
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,326
You're not going anywhere.

609
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:48,287
I'm sure his agency is panicking as well.

610
00:45:48,370 --> 00:45:51,165
I'll keep calling, so you just stay put.

611
00:45:52,082 --> 00:45:54,001
You better not go anywhere.

612
00:45:57,713 --> 00:45:59,465
ANTHONY

613
00:46:03,802 --> 00:46:05,929
The person you have called…

614
00:46:08,474 --> 00:46:11,560
Still, how could you release
the article right away?

615
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:14,104
You should've confirmed with us first.

616
00:46:14,188 --> 00:46:17,191
Fine. Anyway, I'll call you back later.

617
00:46:21,111 --> 00:46:23,322
Damn it!

618
00:46:23,906 --> 00:46:26,116
-The person you have called…
-Anthony.

619
00:46:27,659 --> 00:46:30,245
I'll take care of this.

620
00:46:31,038 --> 00:46:32,831
You should go somewhere quiet.

621
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,377
What about that reporter
who claimed to be a victim?

622
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:39,755
I've been calling him,
but he's not picking up.

623
00:46:39,838 --> 00:46:41,715
This is driving me nuts.

624
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:44,468
Had he told us about this beforehand,

625
00:46:44,551 --> 00:46:46,970
we would've dissuaded him
from going public.

626
00:46:47,054 --> 00:46:50,849
How the hell did he get that photo anyway?
That damn doctor…

627
00:46:58,524 --> 00:47:00,484
Jeong-man, I should go home.

628
00:47:02,361 --> 00:47:03,987
Let me drive you.

629
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,156
It's okay.

630
00:47:18,460 --> 00:47:19,586
What should I do?

631
00:47:28,345 --> 00:47:30,806
Gosh. No.

632
00:47:40,899 --> 00:47:42,317
I'm better than this.

633
00:47:42,401 --> 00:47:45,279
How could I sit still
when my friend's troubled?

634
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:46,363
Yes.

635
00:48:16,143 --> 00:48:17,978
It's me. Open up.

636
00:48:22,190 --> 00:48:24,985
Hurry up. I'll be waiting until you do.

637
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:41,460
Drinking won't solve anything.

638
00:48:41,543 --> 00:48:44,463
I don't get why adults drink
whenever they're troubled.

639
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,425
-Why are you here?
-I wanted to check on you.

640
00:48:48,508 --> 00:48:51,345
You've checked, so leave.
I'm in no mood to chat.

641
00:48:51,428 --> 00:48:55,349
Well, that's rude. I risked my life
to come here because I was worried.

642
00:48:58,810 --> 00:49:03,273
Mr. Yang. It's true that you assaulted
and tormented those kids.

643
00:49:03,357 --> 00:49:05,901
You and your gang stole their money

644
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:07,694
and hit them
because they got on your nerves.

645
00:49:07,778 --> 00:49:10,989
You also mocked poor kids like Ji-eun.

646
00:49:11,073 --> 00:49:13,659
The first thing you should do
is apologize,

647
00:49:13,742 --> 00:49:15,786
not hide here.

648
00:49:18,955 --> 00:49:20,332
ANTHONY SUSPECTED OF BEING A BULLY

649
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:24,378
It's not getting any better.

650
00:49:25,921 --> 00:49:27,964
What should we do about Ms. Kim's drama?

651
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,092
That's not the problem right now.

652
00:49:30,842 --> 00:49:32,719
He will have to drop out.

653
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:36,640
We'll have to pay the cancellation fees
for all the commercials.

654
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,058
Gosh, my head.

655
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:40,143
He'll still be able to work, right?

656
00:49:41,019 --> 00:49:42,938
We should put out the fire first.

657
00:49:43,438 --> 00:49:46,316
He'll have to kneel down and apologize.

658
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,610
He'll have to lay low for about a year.

659
00:49:48,694 --> 00:49:50,195
Then we'll look for a way.

660
00:49:51,863 --> 00:49:53,573
Will that even work?

661
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:55,283
Gosh, that startled me.

662
00:49:56,535 --> 00:49:58,203
Let's go home.

663
00:50:00,205 --> 00:50:01,623
This is driving me up the wall.

664
00:50:29,568 --> 00:50:30,402
Old lady!

665
00:50:31,695 --> 00:50:32,654
Yu-hyeon.

666
00:50:33,905 --> 00:50:35,866
Judging by the voice, it must be her.

667
00:50:35,949 --> 00:50:36,908
Grandpa…

668
00:50:37,951 --> 00:50:39,327
I mean, Mr. Chairman.

669
00:50:39,411 --> 00:50:42,789
I prefer that you call me Grandpa.

670
00:50:44,374 --> 00:50:45,917
How are you feeling?

671
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:48,795
I was deeply heartbroken.

672
00:50:49,921 --> 00:50:54,426
However, you and the other employees
have joined hands to help me.

673
00:50:54,509 --> 00:50:55,844
I couldn't be more grateful.

674
00:50:55,927 --> 00:50:58,180
We did what we ought to do.

675
00:50:58,263 --> 00:51:00,766
We all cherish this company.

676
00:51:01,433 --> 00:51:04,895
What you had told me back then

677
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:07,147
still resonates with me.

678
00:51:08,440 --> 00:51:12,235
You said eating our snacks
brought back happy memories.

679
00:51:13,278 --> 00:51:16,198
During the past several decades
at this company,

680
00:51:16,698 --> 00:51:20,410
that was the most precious
and rewarding thing to hear.

681
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:24,206
Thank you for saying that.

682
00:51:24,706 --> 00:51:26,833
I'm the one who's thankful.

683
00:51:26,917 --> 00:51:29,294
You even snapped some sense into him.

684
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:32,756
I was already like that.

685
00:51:35,634 --> 00:51:36,551
Anyway…

686
00:51:37,385 --> 00:51:40,680
I'll do my best
so that all of your hard work pays off.

687
00:51:41,389 --> 00:51:44,309
Okay. We'll be praying.

688
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:47,229
I'll see you later.

689
00:51:48,772 --> 00:51:49,606
You should go in.

690
00:51:51,983 --> 00:51:53,944
JOA CONFECTIONERY
SHAREHOLDERS MEETING

691
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:05,372
Ha-ni.

692
00:52:05,872 --> 00:52:08,583
Thank you so much for your hard work.

693
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:12,003
By the way, how are things looking?

694
00:52:12,087 --> 00:52:13,630
I'm not sure.

695
00:52:13,713 --> 00:52:15,966
We all tried our best,

696
00:52:16,049 --> 00:52:18,552
but there's not much we can do
with our little shares.

697
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:21,513
We did everything we could.
All that we can do now is wait.

698
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:25,058
Of course. Thanks to all the legwork,
our soles have peeled off.

699
00:52:25,141 --> 00:52:26,101
We should have hope.

700
00:52:26,685 --> 00:52:28,812
I've been walking around endlessly

701
00:52:28,895 --> 00:52:30,772
and lost so much weight.

702
00:52:34,150 --> 00:52:35,485
I don't see it.

703
00:52:35,569 --> 00:52:37,529
Do you want to die? Do you?

704
00:52:37,612 --> 00:52:40,282
Anyway, good work, everyone.

705
00:52:40,949 --> 00:52:44,077
Let's end this with our chant.

706
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:45,203
-Okay.
-Let's do that.

707
00:52:47,122 --> 00:52:48,707
-Snacks for 3-year-olds…
-To 80-year-olds.

708
00:52:48,790 --> 00:52:51,293
-Joa is the best!
-Joa is the best!

709
00:52:52,377 --> 00:52:53,753
Let's not give up!

710
00:52:59,134 --> 00:53:02,012
Pack your things, my son.

711
00:53:03,805 --> 00:53:07,309
I did you a favor and bought
the newest suitcases, so pack well.

712
00:53:07,392 --> 00:53:10,061
Mother, I don't want to go back to the US.

713
00:53:10,145 --> 00:53:11,146
My son.

714
00:53:11,646 --> 00:53:13,690
Do you have to send him away
when he doesn't want to go?

715
00:53:13,773 --> 00:53:15,191
Be quiet.

716
00:53:17,402 --> 00:53:19,446
Why are you sending him off so abruptly?

717
00:53:19,529 --> 00:53:21,031
He has a lot to study,

718
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:23,450
and my husband feels lonely.

719
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:25,827
Go to your room and start packing.

720
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,539
Lucky you for riding a plane, though.

721
00:53:35,795 --> 00:53:36,713
Wait.

722
00:53:37,756 --> 00:53:39,549
I'm going to visit your dad,

723
00:53:39,633 --> 00:53:41,635
so take good care of Ha-ni
and your grandma.

724
00:53:41,718 --> 00:53:43,553
Okay. You can go.

725
00:53:44,387 --> 00:53:47,223
I'm going to work.
Stay home with your grandma.

726
00:53:47,307 --> 00:53:49,434
Buy some snacks on your way home.

727
00:53:49,517 --> 00:53:51,770
You just had a meal. Why would you eat…

728
00:53:56,399 --> 00:53:58,193
Fine. I'll buy some.

729
00:53:59,527 --> 00:54:04,574
I love that you don't nag
like you used to.

730
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:06,868
-Gosh, that little…
-Goodbye.

731
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:34,771
Hello?

732
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,942
Oh, thank you.

733
00:54:39,025 --> 00:54:42,153
Then I'll talk with my eldest daughter
and call you back.

734
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,698
Okay. Thank you.

735
00:54:52,247 --> 00:54:55,250
Do-yun, can you please stop?

736
00:54:58,628 --> 00:55:01,297
Stopping right now won't change anything.

737
00:55:02,382 --> 00:55:03,591
I must protect my mother…

738
00:55:04,551 --> 00:55:07,512
-and you.
-You're not protecting me by doing this.

739
00:55:08,471 --> 00:55:10,181
Why have you changed so much?

740
00:55:10,265 --> 00:55:11,391
Ji-eun.

741
00:55:13,601 --> 00:55:18,189
I'm aware that you were involved
in the plagiarism incident.

742
00:55:19,232 --> 00:55:20,150
I know that.

743
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,863
I also know that you had no choice.

744
00:55:25,780 --> 00:55:28,283
And I had no other choice but to do this
to protect you.

745
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,662
Do-yun.

746
00:55:41,463 --> 00:55:42,630
I didn't do it.

747
00:55:43,882 --> 00:55:45,884
-What?
-Mother told me…

748
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:50,013
that I had to do it for our family.

749
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,726
But I ended up not doing it.

750
00:55:58,855 --> 00:56:03,068
It wasn't the right thing to do
for our family or the baby.

751
00:56:05,028 --> 00:56:05,862
Is that true?

752
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,324
You didn't, did you?

753
00:56:10,283 --> 00:56:13,078
I'm sorry. I thought…

754
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,123
-I'm sorry.
-No, it was my fault.

755
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:22,170
I was embarrassed by the fact
that I let myself be swayed.

756
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,547
That's why I didn't come clean to you.

757
00:56:26,132 --> 00:56:28,593
I'm sorry for not telling you sooner.

758
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,014
No. I'm sorry.

759
00:56:34,057 --> 00:56:35,058
I…

760
00:56:36,309 --> 00:56:38,186
I should've known better.

761
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:43,983
Do-yun. It's not too late to stop.

762
00:56:44,067 --> 00:56:45,485
You can stop now.

763
00:56:48,905 --> 00:56:49,906
No.

764
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:52,450
I've already come too far.

765
00:56:55,912 --> 00:56:57,372
I can't stop here.

766
00:56:59,791 --> 00:57:01,668
Whatever the result may be,

767
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:05,004
you will get hurt.

768
00:57:06,381 --> 00:57:08,383
You don't want this to happen either.

769
00:57:10,051 --> 00:57:11,386
So, please…

770
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:17,934
The shareholders meeting must take place.

771
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:20,436
That's the only way it'll end.

772
00:57:26,901 --> 00:57:28,278
I'll get going now.

773
00:57:39,497 --> 00:57:42,417
The news that Joa Confectionery's dispute
over management rights

774
00:57:42,500 --> 00:57:44,419
will depend on today's
shareholders meeting

775
00:57:44,502 --> 00:57:47,547
has drawn the attention
of the business world.

776
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:51,384
We will now begin the voting
regarding the dismissal

777
00:57:51,468 --> 00:57:53,636
of Joa Confectionery's chairman.

778
00:57:55,847 --> 00:57:57,515
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR HAN JI-SUK

779
00:59:09,170 --> 00:59:12,048
What? I thought she was going to see Dad.

780
00:59:18,012 --> 00:59:19,222
Honey.

781
00:59:27,897 --> 00:59:28,940
I'm here.

782
00:59:30,191 --> 00:59:31,526
Have you been well?

783
00:59:43,246 --> 00:59:44,080
Dad?

784
00:59:47,208 --> 00:59:50,545
Ha-ni. How did you get here?

785
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:57,051
It's dangerous to be roaming outside
like this.

786
00:59:57,135 --> 00:59:58,636
Let's go home. Hurry.

787
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:00,388
-Wait.
-Come here right now!

788
01:00:01,055 --> 01:00:02,098
Oh, no.

789
01:00:06,060 --> 01:00:08,146
WE LOVE YOU, DAD!

790
01:00:11,816 --> 01:00:13,026
Dad?

791
01:00:13,693 --> 01:00:16,696
BAHN GI-TAE

792
01:00:55,401 --> 01:00:58,696
How much you're hurting
and how much pain you're in…

793
01:00:58,780 --> 01:01:00,531
If it ever happens again,

794
01:01:00,615 --> 01:01:03,326
I will do exactly what your father did.

795
01:01:04,077 --> 01:01:05,578
It's not your fault.

796
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:11,000
I hope you are able to stand
face to face with your past self.

797
01:01:11,084 --> 01:01:12,335
Hurry and answer it.

798
01:01:13,378 --> 01:01:16,297
Your grandmother said you had to
answer this for her to live.

799
01:01:19,634 --> 01:01:23,638
