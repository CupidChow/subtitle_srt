1
00:00:52,552 --> 00:00:54,387
I saw you

2
00:00:54,471 --> 00:00:57,265
getting down on your knees and begging!

3
00:00:58,391 --> 00:01:01,311
You have no house, money, or pride.

4
00:01:02,020 --> 00:01:05,106
How dare you give me
such a miserable and humiliating future?

5
00:01:05,732 --> 00:01:09,069
What kind of a life did you live
to turn out so pathetically?

6
00:01:15,742 --> 00:01:17,952
Did you just hit me? What for?

7
00:01:18,036 --> 00:01:19,329
How dare you hit me!

8
00:01:20,038 --> 00:01:21,081
I…

9
00:01:23,708 --> 00:01:25,210
I also

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:28,713
hate my life and wish I were dead.

11
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:33,593
I'm well aware that my life is screwed!

12
00:01:33,676 --> 00:01:35,094
Then die!

13
00:01:35,178 --> 00:01:38,681
Forget it.
I doubt you even have the courage to,

14
00:01:38,765 --> 00:01:40,558
so I'll do it for you.

15
00:01:41,851 --> 00:01:44,979
Now that I know my future,
what hope do I have in life?

16
00:01:55,490 --> 00:01:57,492
I didn't stop you from leaving

17
00:01:58,868 --> 00:02:02,372
because I thought you'd be better off
resenting me instead.

18
00:02:04,833 --> 00:02:06,626
It would hurt less

19
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,004
than you hating yourself

20
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:12,799
after knowing the truth.

21
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:27,981
MOM

22
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,610
-Hey, Mom.
-I heard you caused trouble at Ha-yeong's.

23
00:02:34,195 --> 00:02:35,029
Yes.

24
00:02:35,113 --> 00:02:38,241
Gosh. Even at that age?

25
00:02:39,742 --> 00:02:42,328
Why don't you just move back to Daejeon?

26
00:02:43,705 --> 00:02:45,665
How can I go back there?

27
00:02:45,748 --> 00:02:48,668
I'll handle your grandma,
so head down here.

28
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:53,339
I can't right now
because of my current situation.

29
00:02:53,423 --> 00:02:54,757
What situation?

30
00:02:55,675 --> 00:02:57,510
I have my work here

31
00:02:58,303 --> 00:02:59,721
among other things.

32
00:02:59,804 --> 00:03:02,849
As if a temp job at a supermarket
is a big deal.

33
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:06,227
Don't make it any harder on your sister

34
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:08,146
and come home to get married.

35
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,356
I don't intend to marry.

36
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,359
Then what?
You will grow old a pitiful woman?

37
00:03:15,820 --> 00:03:17,155
Darn it.

38
00:03:17,655 --> 00:03:18,740
VACANT

39
00:03:18,823 --> 00:03:20,575
-City Hall Intersection.
-Sure thing.

40
00:03:21,534 --> 00:03:23,745
I have a customer, so I'll call you back.

41
00:03:23,828 --> 00:03:26,581
-Shit. What the hell?
-Goodness.

42
00:03:27,332 --> 00:03:29,792
Mother, my gosh.
I'm terribly sorry about this.

43
00:03:30,627 --> 00:03:32,170
My mother-in-law has dementia

44
00:03:32,253 --> 00:03:34,547
and I couldn't find anyone to watch her.
I'm sorry.

45
00:03:34,631 --> 00:03:37,175
Mother, please go back to sleep.

46
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:49,604
Why on earth am I living this way?

47
00:03:50,813 --> 00:03:51,689
Is it okay

48
00:03:53,358 --> 00:03:54,859
for me to live like this?

49
00:03:56,653 --> 00:03:58,196
What if

50
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:02,325
my whole life had stopped since that day?

51
00:04:39,904 --> 00:04:42,282
Are these wrinkles?
What are these dark spots?

52
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,076
-Is it seaweed?
-Stop it.

53
00:04:45,159 --> 00:04:46,786
They are freckles.

54
00:04:49,247 --> 00:04:50,999
This isn't my house.

55
00:04:51,082 --> 00:04:53,710
It's Ha-yeong's.
She lets me live with her.

56
00:04:53,793 --> 00:04:56,754
You can go back to Daejeon
or sleep outside. I don't care.

57
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:01,551
What did I do so wrong in my past life
to have you as my sister?

58
00:05:01,634 --> 00:05:03,261
Just leave.

59
00:05:03,344 --> 00:05:06,014
Ma'am. Please.

60
00:05:06,097 --> 00:05:08,975
Just this once.
Please forgive me this once.

61
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,687
This can't be my future.

62
00:05:13,271 --> 00:05:16,024
There is no way I let this happen!

63
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,846
Where the hell could she have gone?

64
00:05:50,141 --> 00:05:52,143
My life is already hard enough.

65
00:05:52,769 --> 00:05:56,230
Why does she have to make it worse
by appearing out of nowhere?

66
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,374
Is it her?

67
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:19,045
I'm sure of it, boss.

68
00:06:29,972 --> 00:06:33,351
Don't just stand there and grab her.

69
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:40,399
No, don't. Please don't kill me!

70
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:42,777
Help me!

71
00:06:54,080 --> 00:06:56,124
So it wasn't a kidnapping.

72
00:06:56,207 --> 00:06:58,292
You were only trying
to stop a suicide attempt.

73
00:06:58,376 --> 00:07:02,380
She kept sighing on the bridge
and was about to jump.

74
00:07:02,463 --> 00:07:03,506
Is it true?

75
00:07:07,426 --> 00:07:08,261
It's not.

76
00:07:08,344 --> 00:07:10,429
It's all right. Please don't be scared.

77
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:13,683
Then why were you at the bridge
at this hour?

78
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,853
Well…

79
00:07:16,936 --> 00:07:19,021
Did you get into an argument
with your husband?

80
00:07:19,105 --> 00:07:21,274
Of course not. I'm not even married.

81
00:07:21,357 --> 00:07:22,650
Was it your boyfriend then?

82
00:07:22,733 --> 00:07:24,235
I don't have a boyfriend.

83
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,696
Do you have a job?

84
00:07:26,779 --> 00:07:29,490
I was probably fired today.

85
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:33,035
Where do you live then?

86
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:35,955
Luxury Village in Gangnam.

87
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:37,415
That's a pricey apartment.

88
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:39,542
-It's my sister's.
-I see.

89
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:43,379
Then we'll take you home tonight--

90
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,339
-I can't go home.
-Why not?

91
00:07:46,841 --> 00:07:49,302
My sister kicked me out.

92
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,262
Do you see what I mean?

93
00:07:52,638 --> 00:07:54,515
It was pretty obvious.

94
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,269
I had no intention of dying
this time around.

95
00:07:58,352 --> 00:08:00,563
But you had in the past?

96
00:08:04,859 --> 00:08:07,820
I wasn't really trying to kill myself.

97
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:11,324
You could say I got lucky.

98
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:15,369
A truck came at me, so…

99
00:08:26,047 --> 00:08:28,341
CALL IF YOU FIND SOMEONE IN NEED
SUICIDE HOTLINE

100
00:08:45,983 --> 00:08:47,318
Take this too.

101
00:08:49,445 --> 00:08:51,614
-Sorry?
-Fate brought us together,

102
00:08:51,697 --> 00:08:54,200
so call me when you're in a pickle.

103
00:08:55,993 --> 00:08:57,328
DEBT COLLECTION

104
00:08:57,912 --> 00:08:58,871
Thank you.

105
00:09:00,289 --> 00:09:01,541
Miss.

106
00:09:02,250 --> 00:09:04,335
Say the Korean word
for "suicide" backwards.

107
00:09:08,297 --> 00:09:09,507
"Let's live."

108
00:09:09,590 --> 00:09:10,675
That's right.

109
00:09:10,758 --> 00:09:13,094
They're like two sides of a coin.

110
00:09:13,177 --> 00:09:14,595
If you have the courage to die,

111
00:09:14,679 --> 00:09:17,974
use it to live your life to the fullest.

112
00:09:19,141 --> 00:09:20,893
I wish you good luck.

113
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:32,113
I lived my life
regretting what happened that day

114
00:09:33,197 --> 00:09:36,867
and I was scared of causing
another moment I'd regret.

115
00:09:38,327 --> 00:09:41,163
I remember my dad chasing after me.

116
00:09:58,347 --> 00:10:01,100
Okay, I'll just reenact the scene.

117
00:10:14,322 --> 00:10:15,740
I can do this.

118
00:10:28,669 --> 00:10:31,130
Seriously? You almost killed me!

119
00:10:31,213 --> 00:10:34,091
What's wrong? Weren't you going to?

120
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:36,135
Why would I die?

121
00:10:36,218 --> 00:10:38,638
I only thought that
this would take me back.

122
00:10:39,221 --> 00:10:41,474
Then give it a shot. I'll push you.

123
00:10:41,557 --> 00:10:44,852
I'm not sure it'll work,
so what if I actually die?

124
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:48,064
Hold on. I see that you're scared to die.

125
00:10:50,191 --> 00:10:51,150
Hey!

126
00:10:51,651 --> 00:10:53,486
Dying isn't easy, you know.

127
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:57,281
You may not know this
because you're still young,

128
00:10:57,365 --> 00:11:00,618
but dying is just as hard and difficult
as living.

129
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:03,537
What the hell should I do then?

130
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:05,164
Am I supposed to live this way

131
00:11:05,247 --> 00:11:07,667
in this crazy world
watching my crappy life?

132
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:10,461
I don't intend to take care of you either.

133
00:11:10,544 --> 00:11:12,922
Then send me back to where I came from.

134
00:11:13,005 --> 00:11:14,590
You promised me!

135
00:11:14,674 --> 00:11:17,635
Once I find a way,
I'll send you back in a heartbeat

136
00:11:17,718 --> 00:11:19,095
even if you insist on staying.

137
00:11:35,986 --> 00:11:37,196
Have you eaten?

138
00:11:40,074 --> 00:11:41,784
Let's go to the convenience store.

139
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:43,869
I'll buy you something.

140
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:45,955
Forget it. I'm getting fried chicken.

141
00:11:47,331 --> 00:11:49,041
You don't have any money.

142
00:11:52,336 --> 00:11:54,422
-Yes, I do.
-Wait, that's my credit card.

143
00:11:54,505 --> 00:11:57,550
Give it back. Hey, give it back!

144
00:11:59,635 --> 00:12:00,678
Hey!

145
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:18,571
Come on in.

146
00:12:29,248 --> 00:12:30,374
So, what will it be?

147
00:12:32,460 --> 00:12:34,170
Tuna with mayonnaise.

148
00:12:34,253 --> 00:12:37,423
Your name. What will you say your name is?

149
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:39,175
Why do you get annoyed so easily?

150
00:12:39,967 --> 00:12:43,804
Also, I thought about it on our way here.

151
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:46,724
You're the one who should
change your name.

152
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:50,644
I mean, just think about it.

153
00:12:50,728 --> 00:12:54,732
I'm way prettier
and definitely more charming.

154
00:12:54,815 --> 00:12:57,526
"Bahn Ha-ni" fits me better,
don't you think?

155
00:12:59,236 --> 00:13:00,404
You can be…

156
00:13:01,739 --> 00:13:03,741
How about "Bahn Seong-mun."

157
00:13:04,408 --> 00:13:08,496
It can be your way of seeking forgiveness
for what you did to my life.

158
00:13:11,874 --> 00:13:16,337
What I've been curious about for 20 years
has finally become clear to me.

159
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,463
And what would that be?

160
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:18,923
Why Mom…

161
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,842
kept smacking me 20 years ago.

162
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:23,552
Stop hitting me!

163
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:27,515
Fine. Tell everyone that
you're Bahn Ha-ni from 20 years ago.

164
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,352
Just don't ask me for help
when people drag you away to torture you.

165
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,191
Then what should I do?

166
00:13:39,652 --> 00:13:40,736
For now,

167
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,365
you'll be my niece who studied abroad.

168
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:45,908
That'll make things easier.

169
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,202
But I can't speak any English.

170
00:13:48,953 --> 00:13:50,829
Say you only lived in Koreatown!

171
00:14:01,590 --> 00:14:02,633
Are you asleep?

172
00:14:05,469 --> 00:14:06,637
Why?

173
00:14:07,888 --> 00:14:09,306
I came up with a name.

174
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:12,309
What is it?

175
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,979
Remember the movie Dad loves?

176
00:14:15,062 --> 00:14:17,064
Gone with the Wind.

177
00:14:17,147 --> 00:14:18,816
I'm naming myself after the heroine.

178
00:14:20,150 --> 00:14:23,153
-Scarlett?
-Yes, that's the one.

179
00:14:26,657 --> 00:14:28,993
So the rest of our family
lives in Daejeon?

180
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,038
Yes.

181
00:14:34,039 --> 00:14:35,916
Grandma must be old by now.

182
00:14:36,959 --> 00:14:40,337
Mom and Dad too. Are they doing all right?

183
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,132
Go to sleep.

184
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:46,343
We need to leave
before the workers come tomorrow.

185
00:14:47,052 --> 00:14:49,972
By the way,
Dad was really mad then, wasn't he?

186
00:14:50,764 --> 00:14:52,558
-When?
-You know.

187
00:14:52,641 --> 00:14:55,769
The day I skipped school
to be at that audition.

188
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,941
Dad was so worried that he followed me.

189
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,027
I feel sorry.

190
00:15:08,741 --> 00:15:09,867
Me too.

191
00:15:33,223 --> 00:15:34,808
Are you "Debt No More"?

192
00:15:34,892 --> 00:15:37,394
And you're "Box Office Domination"?

193
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:40,856
-The merchandise?
-Show me the money first.

194
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:01,210
They're all grade-A merchandise.

195
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:03,921
I don't joke around
when it comes to merchandise.

196
00:16:04,004 --> 00:16:07,508
Shouldn't I get a discount
considering the amount I'm buying?

197
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,844
Seriously? I said, no discounts.

198
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:12,721
You sure are a stickler.

199
00:16:13,555 --> 00:16:15,391
Just enough for a cab ride home.

200
00:16:15,474 --> 00:16:17,726
I'm only selling these
because I need the money,

201
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,312
and it breaks my heart as it is.

202
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:23,065
And I came to buy these in person
all the way from Dangjin

203
00:16:23,148 --> 00:16:24,858
because I appreciate their value.

204
00:16:30,614 --> 00:16:31,448
Thank you.

205
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,788
Here.

206
00:16:38,288 --> 00:16:41,083
An odd number seems heartless,
so let's make it even.

207
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:52,052
I bought a lot.

208
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,435
-Another--
-Seriously?

209
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:07,943
What a sweet deal!

210
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,280
Anthony, how did it go?

211
00:17:11,363 --> 00:17:13,615
They are all limited edition.

212
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:18,954
I wonder who the seller was though.

213
00:17:19,038 --> 00:17:20,831
Someone rich wouldn't sell these.

214
00:17:21,331 --> 00:17:23,250
Maybe it's a gigolo who's now broke?

215
00:17:24,168 --> 00:17:27,504
No wonder he wouldn't give me a discount.
I barely got 20,000 won back.

216
00:17:27,588 --> 00:17:28,505
You got a discount?

217
00:17:28,589 --> 00:17:30,007
-Yes.
-No way.

218
00:17:30,090 --> 00:17:32,426
-Sweet, right?
-Let's get jjajangmyeon with that.

219
00:17:33,260 --> 00:17:36,722
But didn't you say that
they had initials engraved on them?

220
00:17:37,264 --> 00:17:39,516
They won't show though.
That's why they were so cheap.

221
00:17:39,600 --> 00:17:41,351
I can just keep them on.

222
00:17:41,977 --> 00:17:43,395
You're the smartest.

223
00:17:44,104 --> 00:17:47,900
Anthony may seem extravagant
and like a big spender,

224
00:17:47,983 --> 00:17:50,402
but he's more frugal than you think.

225
00:17:52,696 --> 00:17:54,698
I'm feeling generous.
Tangsuyuk is on me too.

226
00:17:55,866 --> 00:17:58,869
Then I'll head to
the Chinese restaurant near our office.

227
00:17:58,952 --> 00:17:59,995
Okay. Let's go.

228
00:18:00,954 --> 00:18:02,164
Yes!

229
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,374
-Anthony.
-Yes?

230
00:18:05,542 --> 00:18:06,376
It's stuck.

231
00:18:07,586 --> 00:18:10,130
-What's stuck?
-This.

232
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:13,926
You put on the ring?
Of course, it's stuck.

233
00:18:14,009 --> 00:18:15,344
-Gyeong-sik.
-Yes?

234
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,846
Buy me a cutting machine.
One that works really well.

235
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:45,791
I had to sell all my precious babies
because of Dad.

236
00:18:51,171 --> 00:18:52,005
That's right.

237
00:18:53,423 --> 00:18:55,592
I won't let him do this to me.

238
00:18:55,676 --> 00:18:58,345
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

239
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:04,601
Do-yun, let's eat lunch together tomorrow.

240
00:19:11,567 --> 00:19:15,279
Gosh, I feel like
you're trying to bribe me.

241
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:18,907
Maybe it's because you're a director,
but you really are quick-witted.

242
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:21,451
Do you need some money, Yu-hyeon?

243
00:19:23,745 --> 00:19:26,707
Can you give me 1.82 billion won?

244
00:19:28,167 --> 00:19:30,711
Isn't that a bit too much
for just one lunchbox?

245
00:19:30,794 --> 00:19:31,962
Forget it, then.

246
00:19:35,090 --> 00:19:36,133
Here.

247
00:19:37,092 --> 00:19:38,385
Let me get a job here.

248
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:43,765
You're really going to do this?

249
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:46,768
What else can I do?
Dad really wants his money back.

250
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,270
And I need to work to do that.

251
00:19:49,396 --> 00:19:51,440
What exactly is your plan?

252
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:05,537
What are you doing here?

253
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:09,374
What? I was just passing by.

254
00:20:09,458 --> 00:20:12,127
Why are you passing by
the company building?

255
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,254
Because I want to.

256
00:20:14,922 --> 00:20:16,924
Do you own this land or what?

257
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:18,550
Yes, I do.

258
00:20:18,634 --> 00:20:20,510
I own it all the way up to there.

259
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:23,138
I'm jealous.

260
00:20:23,972 --> 00:20:25,057
Good for you.

261
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:27,851
I'll be on my way,
so you should get going too.

262
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:29,770
Don't pretend to be busy. You're a bum.

263
00:20:29,853 --> 00:20:31,563
I'm not jobless. I got a job.

264
00:20:31,647 --> 00:20:34,024
What? Where?

265
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:36,860
It's none of your business.
I'm busy, so I'll be off.

266
00:20:41,740 --> 00:20:43,742
That little punk.

267
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:03,136
That punk.

268
00:21:04,012 --> 00:21:06,640
He's one good-looking fellow.

269
00:21:10,852 --> 00:21:12,646
This PC cafe is amazing.

270
00:21:12,729 --> 00:21:14,189
I want to play games.

271
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,191
Just follow me.

272
00:21:18,777 --> 00:21:20,279
-I want to play games.
-There we go.

273
00:21:22,864 --> 00:21:24,950
These guys know everything.

274
00:21:25,033 --> 00:21:28,453
If we're lucky, we might find a way
to send you back in time.

275
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:31,415
Really? Then let's look it up.

276
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,625
HOW TO GO BACK IN TIME

277
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,590
-"The only way to go back
-"The only way to go back

278
00:21:40,674 --> 00:21:42,634
-to your happy past…
-to your happy past…

279
00:21:49,641 --> 00:21:53,020
-is to create a happier future."
-is to create a happier future."

280
00:21:53,520 --> 00:21:55,939
My gosh, what is this?

281
00:21:56,023 --> 00:21:57,607
-Damn it.
-You said they know everything.

282
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,693
They're all just talking nonsense.

283
00:21:59,776 --> 00:22:03,280
There has to be someone
who knows about this stuff.

284
00:22:03,864 --> 00:22:06,074
There is everything on the internet.

285
00:22:06,158 --> 00:22:08,660
This particle
that travels faster than light

286
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:12,122
can be observed when
moving in the same pattern…

287
00:22:12,205 --> 00:22:15,625
It can be explained with the theory
of relativity established in 1915.

288
00:22:15,709 --> 00:22:19,129
That’s right.
That was the law of universal gravity.

289
00:22:19,212 --> 00:22:20,714
According to this theory,

290
00:22:20,797 --> 00:22:23,967
time and space are closely connected
to each other

291
00:22:24,051 --> 00:22:26,345
-and creates the fourth dimension.
-By the way,

292
00:22:26,428 --> 00:22:28,597
doesn't he look like our physics teacher?

293
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,640
-So if you look here…
-Oh, right.

294
00:22:30,724 --> 00:22:33,852
He made us lose interest in physics.
You're totally right.

295
00:22:33,935 --> 00:22:37,064
He looks just like our physics teacher.

296
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,565
My gosh.

297
00:22:38,648 --> 00:22:40,692
Anyway, this isn't going to work.

298
00:22:40,776 --> 00:22:42,402
By any chance,

299
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:45,322
do you happen to know anyone
who's really smart?

300
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,656
Where's the printout?

301
00:22:56,666 --> 00:22:58,001
So what do you want to know?

302
00:23:01,588 --> 00:23:05,300
I don't know where to begin.

303
00:23:05,884 --> 00:23:10,013
But you see,
you're the smartest person I know.

304
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:13,100
What is it about? Go ahead and tell me.

305
00:23:14,184 --> 00:23:18,480
It's something that's actually happened.

306
00:23:19,314 --> 00:23:22,943
It's totally absurd
and completely impossible,

307
00:23:23,527 --> 00:23:25,112
but it actually happened.

308
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,239
What is this about?

309
00:23:27,322 --> 00:23:29,825
Well, you see…

310
00:23:33,537 --> 00:23:36,915
Let's say someone from the past
suddenly showed up.

311
00:23:37,791 --> 00:23:39,292
How can I send that person back?

312
00:23:43,964 --> 00:23:44,965
Who came?

313
00:23:45,841 --> 00:23:46,842
I can't…

314
00:23:48,385 --> 00:23:49,845
tell you.

315
00:23:49,928 --> 00:23:53,723
But it's someone that shouldn't be here.

316
00:23:56,810 --> 00:23:57,853
Aunt.

317
00:23:59,229 --> 00:24:01,481
Don't just stay home reading comic books.

318
00:24:02,149 --> 00:24:04,276
You should go outside
and meet some friends.

319
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,407
No, it's not that.

320
00:24:11,408 --> 00:24:12,367
Aunt.

321
00:24:13,201 --> 00:24:15,495
Since you're here,
you should eat with Mom.

322
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,165
I bet she's still angry at me.

323
00:24:18,748 --> 00:24:20,834
And isn't she working at the hospital?

324
00:24:20,917 --> 00:24:22,836
Today's her day off.

325
00:24:22,919 --> 00:24:24,754
She went to meet someone nearby.

326
00:24:27,924 --> 00:24:29,676
Nearby where?

327
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:38,268
What's taking her so long?

328
00:25:06,671 --> 00:25:07,964
Excuse me.

329
00:25:16,681 --> 00:25:17,682
Yes?

330
00:25:20,352 --> 00:25:22,354
-You left your bag.
-What?

331
00:25:22,437 --> 00:25:23,396
Your bag.

332
00:25:25,649 --> 00:25:26,858
Oh, right.

333
00:26:04,729 --> 00:26:05,855
Are you okay?

334
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:08,692
Did you meet Ha-yeong?

335
00:26:08,775 --> 00:26:10,610
Don't worry. I didn't get caught.

336
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:14,447
Did you figure out how I can go back?

337
00:26:17,534 --> 00:26:18,910
Then what are we going to do?

338
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,956
Don't tell me I have to live here.

339
00:26:24,291 --> 00:26:26,835
I don't know yet.

340
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:30,213
You promised to help me go back.

341
00:26:30,297 --> 00:26:32,799
You have to send me back!

342
00:26:32,882 --> 00:26:33,967
How dare you!

343
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,099
How dare you cause a scene
when you're neither a human nor a ghost?

344
00:26:53,403 --> 00:26:55,530
You were born with so much luck.

345
00:26:58,408 --> 00:27:00,910
How did you end up
living such a misfortunate life?

346
00:27:02,996 --> 00:27:04,706
What do you mean?

347
00:27:05,582 --> 00:27:07,250
Hey, don't respond.

348
00:27:07,334 --> 00:27:08,793
He's either one of the two.

349
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,380
He either wants us to join a cult
or give him money.

350
00:27:13,340 --> 00:27:14,674
Let's go.

351
00:27:15,717 --> 00:27:18,386
You're two different individuals
with the same fortune.

352
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,431
My goodness, how strange.

353
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:26,478
If you're not a ghost, it means…

354
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:32,650
you're both the same person.

355
00:27:35,904 --> 00:27:38,281
If you need help, come with me.

356
00:27:48,541 --> 00:27:50,251
-Wait a minute.
-My gosh.

357
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,587
-Here. Pull it out.
-My goodness.

358
00:27:53,922 --> 00:27:56,508
-Pull on it harder!
-It's too slippery.

359
00:27:56,591 --> 00:27:59,636
If I don't get this out,
Anthony might really cut my finger off.

360
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,222
Just pull it out. Tug on it harder.

361
00:28:02,305 --> 00:28:04,015
Get it out! Pull it out right now!

362
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:08,311
-How did it go?
-I took it off.

363
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:10,271
No, not the ring.

364
00:28:10,355 --> 00:28:12,315
The old photos that I told you to steal.

365
00:28:13,483 --> 00:28:15,568
-That's done too.
-Let's take a look.

366
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:18,655
I've been through so much.

367
00:28:24,536 --> 00:28:27,205
Korea really is the best
when it comes to cosmetic surgery.

368
00:28:30,708 --> 00:28:32,710
Delete the files and burn the flash drive.

369
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:33,670
Okay.

370
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:35,338
-Anthony.
-Yes?

371
00:28:35,422 --> 00:28:37,924
You actually received
two commercial offers.

372
00:28:40,093 --> 00:28:41,136
-Really?
-Yes.

373
00:28:42,512 --> 00:28:45,098
I've still got it.
What kind of commercials are they?

374
00:28:45,181 --> 00:28:47,225
One is for Joa Confectionery.

375
00:28:47,308 --> 00:28:50,103
A snack? I'm not going to shoot
a snack commercial.

376
00:28:50,645 --> 00:28:54,315
Really? Well, the other one
is for a health supplement.

377
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:58,319
Well, it's actually for a magazine.

378
00:28:58,403 --> 00:29:00,363
-Show him the proposal.
-Okay.

379
00:29:00,447 --> 00:29:01,614
Let me see.

380
00:29:04,325 --> 00:29:05,785
"Can't you…"

381
00:29:08,538 --> 00:29:09,539
POWERMAN WILL HELP YOU GET BETTER

382
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,708
Who came up with this slogan?

383
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,209
CAN'T YOU GET IT UP, ANTHONY?

384
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:15,503
Jeong-man, why didn't you say no to this?

385
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:18,673
Our profit is low and we haven't
had commercial offers in ages.

386
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,842
So you just want me to do everything?

387
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,303
Am I your only source of income?

388
00:29:24,596 --> 00:29:25,722
Say no to both of them.

389
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:27,515
Nothing ever works out these days.

390
00:29:30,393 --> 00:29:32,061
Should we go to a fortune-teller?

391
00:29:34,689 --> 00:29:36,232
Do you know a good shaman?

392
00:29:44,115 --> 00:29:49,162
How did you know that we're both
the same person?

393
00:29:50,079 --> 00:29:51,372
It wasn't me.

394
00:29:55,168 --> 00:29:56,961
I was able to know thanks to Jobs.

395
00:30:01,090 --> 00:30:04,677
Then do you know what I can do

396
00:30:06,012 --> 00:30:07,514
to go back?

397
00:30:23,279 --> 00:30:25,281
AX squared plus B squared X.

398
00:30:25,365 --> 00:30:27,992
BX squared plus C equals zero.

399
00:30:28,993 --> 00:30:32,121
Then X equals to minus B plus
minus root A divided by 2A.

400
00:30:34,958 --> 00:30:37,377
-Minus B plus minus root A…
-Hey.

401
00:30:37,460 --> 00:30:40,255
Don't you find him a little strange?

402
00:30:45,802 --> 00:30:48,179
It's because
I've majored in Natural Sciences.

403
00:30:51,766 --> 00:30:55,311
Hey, kid. I see a big cross behind you.

404
00:30:57,188 --> 00:31:00,024
Someone in your family
is either Christian or Catholic.

405
00:31:01,901 --> 00:31:03,903
How did you know?

406
00:31:04,612 --> 00:31:06,823
Our grandma is Catholic.

407
00:31:12,245 --> 00:31:14,038
I smell gasoline.

408
00:31:14,622 --> 00:31:16,124
Someone in your family drives.

409
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,962
Yes, you're right.
My dad is a taxi driver.

410
00:31:21,045 --> 00:31:22,839
He's giving me goosebumps.

411
00:31:24,799 --> 00:31:25,967
Hey.

412
00:31:26,509 --> 00:31:30,138
That could apply to any other family.

413
00:31:30,221 --> 00:31:32,640
But still, he's willing to help.

414
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:35,435
Let's try doing what he says.

415
00:31:35,518 --> 00:31:38,521
How do you think
he's going to help you go back?

416
00:31:38,605 --> 00:31:40,690
I can tell that he's a con artist.

417
00:31:40,773 --> 00:31:43,443
You're looking in all the wrong places.

418
00:31:44,152 --> 00:31:47,906
You don't know why she's here,
but you just want her to go back.

419
00:31:47,989 --> 00:31:50,158
That's why you're not getting anywhere.

420
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:52,869
What…

421
00:31:54,287 --> 00:31:55,413
do you mean?

422
00:31:55,496 --> 00:31:57,999
There must be a reason why she ended up

423
00:31:58,082 --> 00:31:59,918
in a world where she doesn't belong.

424
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,211
So first, you need to find out why.

425
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:09,302
Then what do I need to do?

426
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:11,804
The only way…

427
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,815
is to perform a rite.

428
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:26,235
"A rite"?

429
00:32:26,319 --> 00:32:30,114
You need to do it when it rains heavily.

430
00:32:33,201 --> 00:32:34,118
Rain?

431
00:32:38,915 --> 00:32:40,959
How much does it cost?

432
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:45,421
It normally starts from ten million won,

433
00:32:45,505 --> 00:32:48,007
but you seem to be struggling,
so five million…

434
00:32:48,091 --> 00:32:51,052
I recently got fired.

435
00:32:51,135 --> 00:32:53,596
-We accept credit cards.
-My limit isn't that high.

436
00:32:55,515 --> 00:32:56,766
Then how much can you pay?

437
00:33:00,186 --> 00:33:01,521
Let me repeat myself.

438
00:33:02,605 --> 00:33:06,901
Make sure you pay me back my 1,410,000 won
by the end of this week.

439
00:33:06,985 --> 00:33:08,403
I got it.

440
00:33:09,153 --> 00:33:10,071
I think

441
00:33:10,905 --> 00:33:15,535
I can manage to get 1,400,000 won.

442
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:21,916
Wire me the money by today.

443
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,168
I'll give you a special discount.

444
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:28,506
Thank you!

445
00:33:29,215 --> 00:33:31,467
I'm finally going back!

446
00:33:31,551 --> 00:33:33,177
Yes!

447
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:36,347
Hey, go wait outside.

448
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:37,765
Why?

449
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:39,976
Just do as I say.

450
00:33:55,742 --> 00:33:56,784
First,

451
00:33:57,785 --> 00:34:01,539
I agreed to do this
because I don't know what else to do.

452
00:34:03,332 --> 00:34:06,461
But that money means a lot to me.

453
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:09,213
-If you're lying to me--
-What?

454
00:34:11,007 --> 00:34:14,427
Do I need to tell you
that you killed your father

455
00:34:14,510 --> 00:34:16,220
to make you believe me?

456
00:34:23,561 --> 00:34:25,104
Come back on a rainy day.

457
00:34:43,539 --> 00:34:44,415
What are you doing?

458
00:34:46,375 --> 00:34:47,794
Can you buy me a cell phone?

459
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,713
You'll be going back soon.

460
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,799
It won't even work there.

461
00:34:52,882 --> 00:34:54,634
What? Really?

462
00:34:54,717 --> 00:34:57,887
By the way, do you have 1,400,000 won?

463
00:34:58,971 --> 00:35:00,556
I'm going to get it starting now.

464
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,814
MR. PERVERT

465
00:35:12,652 --> 00:35:15,947
OLD LADY

466
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:23,579
The number you have…

467
00:35:28,918 --> 00:35:30,711
What's wrong? Is he not picking up?

468
00:35:31,379 --> 00:35:33,548
Could that bum have conned you?

469
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:36,509
-He couldn't even pay for the sauna.
-The number…

470
00:35:36,592 --> 00:35:38,886
How will he pay you back 1,400,000 won?

471
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:40,930
It's 1,410,000 won.

472
00:35:45,893 --> 00:35:47,603
OLD LADY: PLEASE CALL ME

473
00:35:53,609 --> 00:35:55,236
GIVE ME A CALL
EXCUSE ME

474
00:36:05,913 --> 00:36:08,416
Don't we need to wire the money
by tonight?

475
00:36:09,041 --> 00:36:10,418
Isn't there anyone else?

476
00:36:18,801 --> 00:36:20,052
SUICIDE HOTLINE

477
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,137
Not this one.

478
00:36:22,221 --> 00:36:23,222
Hold on.

479
00:36:28,978 --> 00:36:29,937
Where did it go?

480
00:36:30,938 --> 00:36:32,982
Here it is!

481
00:36:33,065 --> 00:36:35,568
DEBT COLLECTION

482
00:36:43,242 --> 00:36:44,577
Who is it?

483
00:36:44,660 --> 00:36:46,078
It's room service.

484
00:36:46,162 --> 00:36:47,330
Room service…

485
00:36:50,958 --> 00:36:51,792
Who are you?

486
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:54,170
Are you Mr. Han Yu-hyeon?

487
00:36:56,756 --> 00:36:57,757
Probably not.

488
00:37:06,766 --> 00:37:09,894
Boss, there's nothing here
that we can sell.

489
00:37:11,520 --> 00:37:14,649
Has he gone insane?

490
00:37:15,274 --> 00:37:18,486
How could he hire some thugs?

491
00:37:19,445 --> 00:37:20,488
Thugs?

492
00:37:21,280 --> 00:37:23,324
You're a habitual offender, aren't you?

493
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:25,868
But you're wrong.

494
00:37:25,952 --> 00:37:27,286
There is this poor woman--

495
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,496
Woman?

496
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,500
Hey, old lady.

497
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,588
Is this the person who owes you?

498
00:37:38,464 --> 00:37:40,675
Yes. It's him.

499
00:37:40,758 --> 00:37:42,260
What are you on about?

500
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:44,887
I wired you the money as well as
the sauna fee.

501
00:37:53,187 --> 00:37:54,105
What?

502
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:56,399
HAN YU-HYEON
1,410,000 WON

503
00:38:02,613 --> 00:38:03,614
Did he?

504
00:38:06,117 --> 00:38:09,745
I borrowed 140,000 won
and paid you hundredfold in a few days!

505
00:38:09,829 --> 00:38:11,580
Why are you doing this to me?

506
00:38:11,664 --> 00:38:14,208
I'm sorry.

507
00:38:14,875 --> 00:38:18,296
Boss. She's much more ruthless
than we are.

508
00:38:18,379 --> 00:38:19,463
Gosh.

509
00:38:21,632 --> 00:38:24,510
How could you repay my kindness this way?

510
00:38:24,593 --> 00:38:27,013
After all, I saved your life.

511
00:38:28,139 --> 00:38:31,809
I'm going through something urgent
right now.

512
00:38:33,185 --> 00:38:34,312
I'm sorry.

513
00:38:34,395 --> 00:38:38,733
It seems like there has been
a slight misunderstanding.

514
00:38:38,816 --> 00:38:40,234
Let's end it here.

515
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,902
What are you talking about?

516
00:38:41,986 --> 00:38:43,612
You're all the same.

517
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:46,490
You dragged me here from the hotel
while I was relaxing.

518
00:38:46,574 --> 00:38:48,200
We need to go home and rest too.

519
00:38:49,410 --> 00:38:52,788
There's no rest to being a thug.

520
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,417
Look at you.
You should watch what you say.

521
00:38:57,126 --> 00:39:00,212
It's people who run off
after borrowing money

522
00:39:00,296 --> 00:39:01,881
who should be suffering, not us.

523
00:39:01,964 --> 00:39:04,967
We strictly abide labor laws.

524
00:39:05,051 --> 00:39:06,135
You bet.

525
00:39:06,218 --> 00:39:09,013
Then what about me?
How am I to go home like this?

526
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:15,144
Hey, lady. Do you know how to drive?

527
00:39:16,187 --> 00:39:17,063
Sorry?

528
00:39:27,323 --> 00:39:29,867
Sir. Get home safe.

529
00:39:34,663 --> 00:39:36,791
You should watch out, old lady.

530
00:39:36,874 --> 00:39:39,794
Also, let's never meet again.

531
00:39:41,879 --> 00:39:43,589
-Sir.
-What is it this time?

532
00:39:43,672 --> 00:39:45,216
Your belongings.

533
00:39:52,515 --> 00:39:53,682
Oh, no.

534
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,352
Come on.

535
00:40:01,107 --> 00:40:03,234
-Sir.
-What?

536
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:07,655
Where did you get that keychain?

537
00:40:07,738 --> 00:40:09,031
What's it to you?

538
00:40:10,783 --> 00:40:12,076
Because I think it's mine.

539
00:40:13,285 --> 00:40:14,286
What?

540
00:40:17,289 --> 00:40:19,500
That lily of the valley keychain…

541
00:40:20,668 --> 00:40:23,629
My dad made one for me,

542
00:40:24,130 --> 00:40:25,673
and I lost it.

543
00:40:41,355 --> 00:40:43,983
For every 10 won we find,
you'll get a beating, okay?

544
00:40:44,692 --> 00:40:47,278
-I really have no money.
-Search him.

545
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:54,702
What?

546
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,037
-What is it?
-Captain.

547
00:40:57,121 --> 00:40:58,789
This is the only thing he has.

548
00:40:58,873 --> 00:41:02,376
-Not this! Anything but this!
-Let me see it.

549
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:06,922
It looks pretty.

550
00:41:07,006 --> 00:41:08,466
Ha-ni would love this.

551
00:41:08,549 --> 00:41:12,219
No! My mom gave that to me!

552
00:41:12,303 --> 00:41:15,181
"No! My mom gave that to me!"

553
00:41:17,933 --> 00:41:19,810
It's okay.

554
00:41:19,894 --> 00:41:23,689
Tell her you helped a poor friend out,
and she'll love it even more.

555
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:25,941
Please give it back, mister.

556
00:41:26,025 --> 00:41:26,984
-Please.
-Hey!

557
00:41:27,860 --> 00:41:28,861
Why am I a "mister"?

558
00:41:28,944 --> 00:41:30,946
Do I need to teach you a lesson?

559
00:41:31,030 --> 00:41:32,448
You little…

560
00:41:34,700 --> 00:41:36,869
Does it hurt? Not for me.

561
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,746
Hey, don't cry.

562
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:40,122
Yang Chun-sik!

563
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:42,875
Could that be our dear Ha-ni?

564
00:41:44,084 --> 00:41:45,169
Hi, babe.

565
00:42:02,853 --> 00:42:04,605
How could you steal from a little boy?

566
00:42:05,606 --> 00:42:08,692
Do this again, and you'll pay for it.

567
00:42:09,610 --> 00:42:10,694
Got that?

568
00:42:13,781 --> 00:42:15,324
Are you okay?

569
00:42:15,407 --> 00:42:17,159
Are you all right?

570
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,760
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

571
00:42:38,931 --> 00:42:40,307
Let me do it for you.

572
00:42:47,523 --> 00:42:49,483
It's a smile pendant. How pretty.

573
00:42:50,192 --> 00:42:52,820
My late mom made it for me.

574
00:42:53,404 --> 00:42:55,698
She said I looked the prettiest
when I smiled.

575
00:42:55,781 --> 00:42:57,074
I see.

576
00:42:58,325 --> 00:43:01,203
Then you should wipe those tears
and smile for her again.

577
00:43:07,001 --> 00:43:09,336
You really have a beautiful smile.

578
00:43:10,588 --> 00:43:12,673
By the way, what's your name?

579
00:43:12,756 --> 00:43:14,049
My name?

580
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:18,804
I'm Superman who saved you
from those villains.

581
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:19,972
"Superman"?

582
00:43:20,055 --> 00:43:21,181
Yes.

583
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:24,435
If you ever find someone in trouble,

584
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,729
do the same, and be their Superman.

585
00:43:26,812 --> 00:43:27,813
Okay?

586
00:43:29,106 --> 00:43:31,483
I'll get going then. Bye.

587
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:00,721
What is it?

588
00:44:04,850 --> 00:44:06,101
Superman?

589
00:44:06,894 --> 00:44:07,978
What?

590
00:44:09,104 --> 00:44:10,105
I mean…

591
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:13,984
Prove that this is yours.

592
00:44:14,985 --> 00:44:18,739
One of the flowers is cut off.

593
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:21,075
I messed around while Dad was making it

594
00:44:21,158 --> 00:44:23,535
and one of them came off.

595
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:26,330
And my sister has the same one.

596
00:44:28,457 --> 00:44:29,458
It is her.

597
00:44:31,794 --> 00:44:32,836
Here you go.

598
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,255
Take it. You said it's yours.

599
00:44:43,389 --> 00:44:45,015
Thank you.

600
00:44:45,099 --> 00:44:46,642
That's it?

601
00:44:46,725 --> 00:44:47,851
What?

602
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:50,729
Since you owe me,
it's your turn to repay me this time.

603
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,525
But I don't have any money.

604
00:44:54,608 --> 00:44:55,692
I didn't ask for any.

605
00:44:57,069 --> 00:44:58,153
Then…

606
00:44:58,737 --> 00:44:59,738
Well…

607
00:45:01,615 --> 00:45:03,075
I'll let you know next time.

608
00:45:34,064 --> 00:45:35,315
What is all this?

609
00:45:36,483 --> 00:45:38,152
I'll be going back soon,

610
00:45:38,235 --> 00:45:41,155
so I prepared a surprise farewell party.

611
00:45:41,738 --> 00:45:43,157
Where did you get the money?

612
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:46,743
What? You gave me money
for food and transportation.

613
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:51,331
So you chose to starve
and prepare all this?

614
00:45:51,415 --> 00:45:53,709
Yes, because I'll be leaving soon.

615
00:45:54,293 --> 00:45:56,044
I can skip a meal.

616
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,922
The rite is supposed to be on a rainy day.

617
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:00,215
Who knows when it'll rain?

618
00:46:00,299 --> 00:46:03,385
Who knows? It could rain tomorrow.

619
00:46:04,219 --> 00:46:07,347
That's why we should say farewell
in advance.

620
00:46:09,183 --> 00:46:11,560
Are you that exhilarated to go back?

621
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:13,479
Of course.

622
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,649
Seeing how I turned out 20 years later
was downright terrifying.

623
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:23,447
Fine. I'm sorry about that.

624
00:46:23,530 --> 00:46:26,992
There you go again.
You used to be such a confident girl.

625
00:46:27,075 --> 00:46:28,702
Why do you always seem daunted now?

626
00:46:29,953 --> 00:46:32,122
You don't even speak for yourself
when wronged.

627
00:46:32,206 --> 00:46:34,249
You keep apologizing to everyone.

628
00:46:35,042 --> 00:46:36,585
Don't you feel sorry for yourself?

629
00:46:38,545 --> 00:46:39,379
What?

630
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:43,717
To be honest, I don't care if I embarrass
myself in front of others.

631
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:45,511
They will forget about it in time.

632
00:46:46,220 --> 00:46:48,472
But I can never forget humiliating myself.

633
00:46:49,932 --> 00:46:52,935
I remember stealing a bubblegum
when I was seven,

634
00:46:53,018 --> 00:46:56,355
spotting my dad's taxi and running away
in elementary school,

635
00:46:56,438 --> 00:47:00,234
and turning a blind eye to Ji-eun
being bullied in middle school.

636
00:47:01,276 --> 00:47:03,487
-You--
-Do you not remember that?

637
00:47:03,987 --> 00:47:05,906
Have you forgotten about them?

638
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:10,035
-No.
-See?

639
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:13,914
You should stop running away
or humiliating yourself.

640
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,333
You'll only feel sorry for yourself
that way.

641
00:47:24,049 --> 00:47:26,885
The press release will be distributed
after 10 a.m. today.

642
00:47:26,969 --> 00:47:29,805
I believe the Squid-good incident
will finally come to an end.

643
00:47:29,888 --> 00:47:31,640
-That is all.
-Good work.

644
00:47:32,349 --> 00:47:35,602
Although it may have been fabricated
by a problematic consumer,

645
00:47:35,686 --> 00:47:39,773
it won't be easy for us to restore
our product's tarnished image.

646
00:47:40,315 --> 00:47:42,859
We're currently looking for a new model

647
00:47:42,943 --> 00:47:46,947
to produce a comical advertisement
that will restore the product's image.

648
00:47:47,030 --> 00:47:49,658
The development process was long,

649
00:47:49,741 --> 00:47:52,744
and it received a high score
during the taste test.

650
00:47:52,828 --> 00:47:55,038
It'd be a waste to end the product.

651
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:58,667
That's right.
Alongside Squid-good's advertisement,

652
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,836
we're thinking about moving up
the release date

653
00:48:00,919 --> 00:48:04,464
of our upcoming products in order
to achieve our yearly sales goal.

654
00:48:05,674 --> 00:48:07,217
Would this be possible?

655
00:48:08,010 --> 00:48:10,053
We'd be on a tight schedule,

656
00:48:10,137 --> 00:48:13,640
but we were already preparing
for the next lineup anyway.

657
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:16,310
I believe it will be possible.

658
00:48:18,020 --> 00:48:19,563
When can you complete it?

659
00:48:21,481 --> 00:48:22,983
When would you like it?

660
00:48:26,612 --> 00:48:28,614
Two weeks. Is that possible?

661
00:48:29,531 --> 00:48:31,491
Yes, sir. We'll prepare to do so.

662
00:48:41,793 --> 00:48:44,087
"Don't be afraid of losing things.

663
00:48:45,172 --> 00:48:47,758
You will gain more in the end."

664
00:48:48,592 --> 00:48:50,594
There is nothing more
I could possibly lose.

665
00:48:57,309 --> 00:48:59,144
When will it rain?

666
00:49:02,105 --> 00:49:03,231
How's the forecast?

667
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:05,609
Don't talk to me, I'm busy.

668
00:49:06,360 --> 00:49:08,779
Tell me what the forecast says.

669
00:49:08,862 --> 00:49:10,405
I said I'm busy.

670
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:12,282
Then buy me a cell phone.

671
00:49:14,242 --> 00:49:15,452
You're unbelievable.

672
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,039
Gosh.

673
00:49:20,832 --> 00:49:22,668
SQUID-GOOD INCIDENT
REVEALED TO BE A FABRICATION

674
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:30,550
"The child's mother wanted
a compensation fee…"

675
00:49:34,513 --> 00:49:36,640
It's going to work out.

676
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,558
What? Will it rain today?

677
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:43,271
No. I think I can get my job back.

678
00:49:44,022 --> 00:49:47,192
What? I can't come back to work?

679
00:49:47,275 --> 00:49:48,944
-So--
-What do you mean?

680
00:49:49,027 --> 00:49:52,447
Joa Confectionery sent over
a new employee.

681
00:49:52,531 --> 00:49:54,658
But I was unjustly fired.

682
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:57,452
I know. I also think it was terrible.

683
00:49:57,536 --> 00:50:00,580
But I can't fire the new employee
just because of you.

684
00:50:02,124 --> 00:50:03,041
Fine.

685
00:50:03,625 --> 00:50:06,294
If that's what you want,
then let's do that.

686
00:50:07,421 --> 00:50:09,506
Hello, is this HR?

687
00:50:09,589 --> 00:50:13,301
You know that new employee with triplets?

688
00:50:13,385 --> 00:50:16,179
The one who wanted to make money
for her baby's formula.

689
00:50:17,055 --> 00:50:18,265
Fire her.

690
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:22,561
-Don't be afraid of losing things.
-I know her husband is very ill.

691
00:50:22,644 --> 00:50:24,062
But what can I do?

692
00:50:24,146 --> 00:50:28,066
How could she take Ha-ni's place
here at the mart? Can she?

693
00:50:28,150 --> 00:50:29,735
No, she can't.

694
00:50:29,818 --> 00:50:33,739
So give her a few diapers
and send her home.

695
00:50:33,822 --> 00:50:34,781
Gosh, the phone…

696
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:40,036
I guess you can receive calls
while you're on the phone.

697
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:40,954
BAHN HA-NI

698
00:50:41,037 --> 00:50:42,789
Ha-ni?

699
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:43,957
Did you know?

700
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,294
If your superior is an asshole,
you can just badmouth them.

701
00:50:47,377 --> 00:50:49,504
But if they pretend to be nice,

702
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:53,425
you only end up badmouthing
and blaming yourself.

703
00:50:53,508 --> 00:50:56,636
Come on, Ha-ni. "Pretend to be nice"?
I think the world of you.

704
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:58,972
Then you should be more straightforward

705
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,225
and not hurt my self-esteem.

706
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:03,518
Come on.

707
00:51:03,602 --> 00:51:05,562
I'm going to quit,

708
00:51:06,104 --> 00:51:07,981
so let me say one thing.

709
00:51:11,109 --> 00:51:14,905
I'm saying this because I'm worried
about your health.

710
00:51:16,907 --> 00:51:20,577
You should get a checkup
for any tonsil stones.

711
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:21,620
Why?

712
00:51:22,954 --> 00:51:24,748
Every time you open your mouth,

713
00:51:25,791 --> 00:51:27,250
I get a warm whiff

714
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:30,086
of a foul smell.

715
00:51:31,338 --> 00:51:33,048
Goodness, how could you?

716
00:51:34,341 --> 00:51:37,010
Ha-ni, it's because I have indigestion.

717
00:51:56,071 --> 00:51:57,113
Wait up!

718
00:51:57,781 --> 00:51:59,032
How did it go?

719
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:00,534
Did you get your job back?

720
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:03,119
No, I decided to quit.

721
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:05,705
Then why are you all smiles?

722
00:52:09,835 --> 00:52:11,962
Because it had been ages…

723
00:52:14,422 --> 00:52:16,633
since I had done something for myself.

724
00:52:16,716 --> 00:52:17,801
What do you mean?

725
00:52:17,884 --> 00:52:19,261
You said so yourself.

726
00:52:20,262 --> 00:52:22,305
You told me not to humiliate myself.

727
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:26,226
Still, we need to put food on the table.

728
00:52:26,309 --> 00:52:28,103
You should have begged them.

729
00:52:28,186 --> 00:52:30,772
I don't care. My life is already done for.

730
00:52:30,856 --> 00:52:32,274
I'm going to do what I want.

731
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:37,946
Then how are we going to eat
while I'm here?

732
00:52:38,029 --> 00:52:41,116
You don't have any money or a job.
Should we just starve?

733
00:52:41,199 --> 00:52:44,369
Once the house gets fixed,
we won't be able to live there anymore.

734
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:49,583
What is it?

735
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:55,130
PUNISH THE BUILDING OWNER
WHO EXPLOITS SMALL BUSINESSES

736
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,260
-Thank you.
-Enjoy.

737
00:53:00,343 --> 00:53:01,344
Thank you.

738
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,139
Do you want more?

739
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:16,735
Hey, old man!

740
00:53:17,485 --> 00:53:18,820
You're so greedy.

741
00:53:18,904 --> 00:53:21,656
"One per person."
We have fixed quantities, okay?

742
00:53:21,740 --> 00:53:23,992
You idiot.

743
00:53:24,075 --> 00:53:27,537
Are you talking down to an employee
just because you own the place?

744
00:53:27,621 --> 00:53:31,708
I might as well report this
on the company intranet.

745
00:53:33,501 --> 00:53:34,961
-Gosh.
-Give that back.

746
00:53:36,129 --> 00:53:37,756
You only get one serving.

747
00:53:38,757 --> 00:53:39,633
Next.

748
00:53:39,716 --> 00:53:41,718
How did you get in here?

749
00:53:41,801 --> 00:53:44,471
In here? I have a cooking certificate
for Korean cuisine.

750
00:53:44,554 --> 00:53:46,056
I applied for the job and passed.

751
00:53:46,806 --> 00:53:48,475
What are you scheming?

752
00:53:48,558 --> 00:53:50,435
You told me to pay you back!

753
00:53:50,518 --> 00:53:51,937
So I'm working hard!

754
00:53:54,356 --> 00:53:56,900
I can see right through you.

755
00:53:56,983 --> 00:54:00,695
You thought
I'd give up and forgive you, didn't you?

756
00:54:01,863 --> 00:54:03,949
I don't care how long it takes.

757
00:54:04,032 --> 00:54:04,991
Pay me back!

758
00:54:08,203 --> 00:54:11,373
Dad, why are you doing this to me?

759
00:54:11,456 --> 00:54:13,083
Are you bored? Are you lonely?

760
00:54:14,501 --> 00:54:15,794
I have an important meeting.

761
00:54:15,877 --> 00:54:17,420
If you're done, get out of here.

762
00:54:18,546 --> 00:54:20,632
Darn it!

763
00:54:21,549 --> 00:54:23,009
CHAIRMAN

764
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:24,010
Dad.

765
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:27,722
Forgive me this once, please?

766
00:54:27,806 --> 00:54:29,641
I'll do anything you say.

767
00:54:30,642 --> 00:54:32,852
You always get sick of everything
so quick.

768
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:34,562
What's with you?

769
00:54:34,646 --> 00:54:36,815
You know I always finish what I start.

770
00:54:37,524 --> 00:54:38,525
Really?

771
00:54:40,068 --> 00:54:41,319
In that case…

772
00:54:43,571 --> 00:54:47,200
Work at our cafeteria for 100 days.

773
00:54:48,618 --> 00:54:51,121
If you succeed, I'll get rid of your debt

774
00:54:51,204 --> 00:54:53,915
and let you do whatever you want.

775
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,293
You better keep your word.

776
00:54:57,377 --> 00:55:00,714
Promise me you won't pester me
once I hold out for 100 days.

777
00:55:02,799 --> 00:55:06,678
I doubt you will stay even for ten days.

778
00:55:06,761 --> 00:55:09,472
You will get sick of it
and run away again.

779
00:55:11,016 --> 00:55:13,143
Dad, don't you know who I am?

780
00:55:13,226 --> 00:55:16,354
Even if I shed tears of blood
while peeling those onions,

781
00:55:16,438 --> 00:55:17,981
I will never give up.

782
00:55:19,941 --> 00:55:21,401
You just wait and see.

783
00:55:32,704 --> 00:55:34,873
Him and his useless pride.

784
00:55:39,044 --> 00:55:40,128
But, still…

785
00:55:41,004 --> 00:55:44,466
I'll get to see him for the next 100 days.

786
00:55:46,593 --> 00:55:49,637
What was Yu-hyeon planning to do?

787
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:53,725
This is how they have always been.

788
00:55:53,808 --> 00:55:55,935
They bicker until one of them yields.

789
00:55:56,019 --> 00:55:58,521
Aren't they both too headstrong?

790
00:55:59,439 --> 00:56:00,440
I'm not sure.

791
00:56:01,441 --> 00:56:04,611
Nevertheless, I envy their relationship.

792
00:56:08,531 --> 00:56:11,409
I love seeing you like this.

793
00:56:11,951 --> 00:56:16,164
-What?
-You look like a poor, drenched puppy.

794
00:56:18,416 --> 00:56:20,752
JOA CONFECTIONERY
SHOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY

795
00:56:23,797 --> 00:56:24,672
THIS IS UNFAIR

796
00:56:48,029 --> 00:56:49,239
You still got it.

797
00:56:49,322 --> 00:56:52,158
I didn't know I could remember this.

798
00:56:53,535 --> 00:56:55,161
What are they doing?

799
00:57:09,592 --> 00:57:11,010
SQUID-FOOD INCIDENT
WHY ME

800
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,066
What's gotten into you
to do something like this?

801
00:57:25,150 --> 00:57:26,901
I didn't want to humiliate myself.

802
00:57:28,027 --> 00:57:31,114
Especially in front of my teenage self.

803
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:35,535
You're finally acting like
the true Bahn Ha-ni.

804
00:57:41,458 --> 00:57:44,752
You're having Geoseong snacks
in front of Joa Confectionery.

805
00:57:44,836 --> 00:57:47,630
They are so obnoxious.
That's why I bought this.

806
00:57:48,214 --> 00:57:50,467
What? "Obnoxious"?

807
00:57:50,550 --> 00:57:53,136
What is it? Did something happen?

808
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,141
It must have been so unfair for you.

809
00:57:59,517 --> 00:58:02,145
I hope you can return
to your workplace soon.

810
00:58:04,063 --> 00:58:06,691
Contract workers like me are like flies.

811
00:58:07,275 --> 00:58:08,401
But still…

812
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,489
I shouldn't give up
just because I've been swatted once.

813
00:58:14,782 --> 00:58:17,869
I'm truly sorry.

814
00:58:19,120 --> 00:58:20,371
Why would you be?

815
00:58:20,955 --> 00:58:22,624
I may have grown older,

816
00:58:22,707 --> 00:58:25,043
but I don't think I've matured enough.

817
00:58:28,588 --> 00:58:31,674
I feel the same way.

818
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,929
I constantly feel indebted

819
00:58:36,012 --> 00:58:37,639
to the hardworking youth.

820
00:58:39,307 --> 00:58:40,892
Thank you for enduring.

821
00:58:41,601 --> 00:58:45,104
And thank you for not giving up
and standing your ground.

822
00:58:47,815 --> 00:58:52,320
Your encouraging words
are giving me courage.

823
00:58:53,071 --> 00:58:54,656
I'm glad you feel that way.

824
00:58:55,949 --> 00:58:58,117
Let's be patient.

825
00:58:59,035 --> 00:59:01,246
I'm sure you'll receive good news.

826
00:59:02,372 --> 00:59:03,665
Thank you.

827
00:59:06,584 --> 00:59:09,170
By the way, young women these days
rarely eat snacks

828
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:11,214
since they don't want to gain weight.

829
00:59:11,297 --> 00:59:13,383
I love snacks so much.

830
00:59:15,343 --> 00:59:16,511
I agree.

831
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:20,348
I could skip a meal,
but I could never give up on snacks.

832
00:59:20,974 --> 00:59:21,808
Is that so?

833
00:59:22,308 --> 00:59:23,810
Especially the snacks…

834
00:59:26,020 --> 00:59:30,483
that my dad used to buy on his way home
from work to make me feel better…

835
00:59:35,405 --> 00:59:36,698
were the tastiest.

836
00:59:39,534 --> 00:59:42,745
That's why even to this day,
I become happy

837
00:59:43,871 --> 00:59:45,748
whenever I eat snacks.

838
00:59:56,718 --> 00:59:58,636
-Guess what?
-What?

839
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,432
I've never seen you grinning
from ear to ear before.

840
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,434
Really?

841
01:00:05,351 --> 01:00:08,062
I guess I was reminiscing
about the good old days.

842
01:00:09,105 --> 01:00:11,524
Seeing you smile

843
01:00:11,608 --> 01:00:13,901
made me happy for the first time
after coming here.

844
01:00:19,657 --> 01:00:21,284
Every time I was happy,

845
01:00:21,868 --> 01:00:24,037
I would do that out of habit.

846
01:00:25,830 --> 01:00:28,833
It would be great
if I could keep making you smile.

847
01:00:34,297 --> 01:00:38,051
Why did we cross paths?

848
01:00:41,804 --> 01:00:43,598
What song are we dancing to tomorrow?

849
01:00:43,681 --> 01:00:46,434
Which is more important?
Protesting or dancing?

850
01:00:46,517 --> 01:00:48,478
It doesn't matter as long as we're happy.

851
01:00:49,187 --> 01:00:51,981
Then how about "First Love" by Clon?

852
01:00:52,690 --> 01:00:55,652
-I just loved being by your side
-I just loved being by your side

853
01:00:55,735 --> 01:00:58,821
-I don't know why I'm like this these days
-I don't know why I'm like this these days

854
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:10,875
Ha-yeong.

855
01:01:15,338 --> 01:01:16,631
Bahn Ha-ni.

856
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:20,343
Yes.

857
01:01:23,096 --> 01:01:24,430
Bahn Ha-ni.

858
01:01:36,818 --> 01:01:38,569
SPECIAL THANKS TO CHO HAN-CHEUL

859
01:02:09,016 --> 01:02:10,893
I really hope it rains soon.

860
01:02:11,686 --> 01:02:13,146
You seem familiar.

861
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:15,148
Whatever. Just take off that coat.

862
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,608
I think I know what he is.

863
01:02:17,692 --> 01:02:20,862
-I guess it must be fate.
-No, I'm sure it's just a coincidence.

864
01:02:20,945 --> 01:02:22,655
Don't ever get involved with that guy.

865
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:24,490
-Buy me dinner.
-Why?

866
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:26,492
You agreed to pay me back.

867
01:02:27,785 --> 01:02:29,287
You still have this?

868
01:02:29,370 --> 01:02:31,330
I have to find it.

869
01:02:31,414 --> 01:02:34,000
Our Ha-ni is here.

870
01:02:34,083 --> 01:02:38,004
