00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,471
EPISODE 9

2
00:00:55,054 --> 00:00:56,973
-This is unbelievable.
-Move.

3
00:00:57,056 --> 00:00:58,183
Damn it.

4
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:01,561
Gosh, come on. Just leave.

5
00:01:01,644 --> 00:01:04,105
Come on.

6
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:06,900
Hey, hurry up.

7
00:01:07,859 --> 00:01:10,945
How could you attract
those good-for-nothings?

8
00:01:11,029 --> 00:01:12,572
I didn't attract anyone.

9
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:17,452
Damn it.

10
00:01:22,332 --> 00:01:24,375
-Tell me the truth.
-About what?

11
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,045
Do you like Ha-ni?

12
00:01:28,797 --> 00:01:30,340
Me? Who?

13
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:33,092
That old lady? Goodness.

14
00:01:34,093 --> 00:01:35,970
Do you like her?

15
00:01:38,973 --> 00:01:41,392
Yes. I think so.

16
00:01:50,360 --> 00:01:52,195
We were robbed.

17
00:01:53,530 --> 00:01:54,614
What the hell?

18
00:01:55,156 --> 00:01:56,950
Seriously? Were we robbed?

19
00:01:57,033 --> 00:01:58,535
Stealing from the poor?

20
00:01:58,618 --> 00:02:00,578
We don't have anything worth stealing!

21
00:02:00,662 --> 00:02:02,872
- We were robbed.
- Old lady, what is it? A robber?

22
00:02:02,956 --> 00:02:04,541
Don't you worry.

23
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,501
I served in the Marine Corps,

24
00:02:06,584 --> 00:02:08,461
so I'll teach that robber a lesson.

25
00:02:08,545 --> 00:02:10,964
As a former member of the special forces,

26
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:13,508
-I'll sort this out for you.
-What a liar.

27
00:02:13,591 --> 00:02:16,177
I looked it up.
You were a social service agent.

28
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,512
You have no idea

29
00:02:17,595 --> 00:02:20,849
how hard I had to train
for Saving the Last Soldier.

30
00:02:20,932 --> 00:02:22,392
All you do is lie!

31
00:02:22,475 --> 00:02:24,435
As if you know anything.

32
00:02:24,519 --> 00:02:26,187
Stop it, the both of you!

33
00:02:32,402 --> 00:02:34,445
Wait. What's that sound?

34
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:37,115
-This isn't funny.
-There's that voice again.

35
00:02:37,198 --> 00:02:38,241
What?

36
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,880
Get the garlic and the cross.

37
00:02:51,963 --> 00:02:53,673
Why? Are you heading out there?

38
00:02:54,757 --> 00:02:55,842
It could be a cat.

39
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,554
Then why would you need
garlic and a cross?

40
00:03:00,305 --> 00:03:04,100
He's right. Why would you need them
if there were no ghosts?

41
00:03:04,183 --> 00:03:07,562
Well, it's better than
going out there unarmed.

42
00:03:08,563 --> 00:03:09,856
-What the…
-Damn it.

43
00:03:25,121 --> 00:03:27,123
Where are you? Come out here!

44
00:03:27,206 --> 00:03:28,499
Come on out!

45
00:03:29,334 --> 00:03:31,920
-I'm scared.
-She had to have gone this way.

46
00:03:32,003 --> 00:03:33,296
I'm scared.

47
00:03:34,923 --> 00:03:36,007
Jeez!

48
00:03:50,855 --> 00:03:52,815
Anthony? Did you see a ghost?

49
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:54,651
Wake up.

50
00:03:58,196 --> 00:03:59,239
Sneakers?

51
00:04:00,198 --> 00:04:01,074
-Hold on.
-What?

52
00:04:01,157 --> 00:04:03,451
Why is a ghost wearing sneakers?

53
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,495
Don't be ridiculous.
Ghosts don't have feet.

54
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:09,707
-Wait. It's running away.
-It's getting away!

55
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,084
-It's running off.
-Hey!

56
00:04:11,167 --> 00:04:13,044
-Get her.
-Hey, stop right there!

57
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,671
Stop right there.

58
00:04:14,754 --> 00:04:16,422
-Stop!
-Hey, get up.

59
00:04:27,976 --> 00:04:28,977
What the hell?

60
00:04:35,483 --> 00:04:36,567
Go. Get her.

61
00:04:37,151 --> 00:04:39,320
What the hell? What was that?

62
00:04:40,989 --> 00:04:43,574
Hey, stop right there.

63
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,743
Who the hell are you?

64
00:04:49,038 --> 00:04:51,457
-You!
-Stop right there!

65
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:53,626
-Hey, stop right there.
-Stop!

66
00:05:02,719 --> 00:05:03,886
Watch your step.

67
00:05:09,183 --> 00:05:10,393
What the…

68
00:05:10,476 --> 00:05:12,312
-Stop her.
-Hey!

69
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:14,272
-Stop right there.
-Damn it.

70
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:17,358
-Yu-hyeon, what's going on?
-Get that ghost!

71
00:05:24,532 --> 00:05:25,616
You…

72
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:28,411
-Hey.
-What the hell?

73
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,626
Damn it. You did that on purpose!

74
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,309
-I'm sorry too.
-You're sorry?

75
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:54,187
You must be out of your mind.

76
00:05:54,270 --> 00:05:56,105
-You're the one who's insane.
-Hey, wait.

77
00:05:56,189 --> 00:05:59,067
This isn't the time for that.
What about the ghost?

78
00:06:01,277 --> 00:06:02,695
We'll finish this later.

79
00:06:02,779 --> 00:06:04,739
Fine by me, Yang Chun-sik.

80
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,246
-How did you know?
-What?

81
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:13,915
How did you know that?

82
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,252
You really must be Yang Chun-sik.

83
00:06:23,049 --> 00:06:24,300
First the ghost, then him.

84
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,038
-What?
-What the hell?

85
00:06:59,585 --> 00:07:00,962
Wait. Did you catch her?

86
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,216
What the hell?

87
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,343
Who are you?

88
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:13,099
I'm a ghost.

89
00:07:16,394 --> 00:07:17,645
A ghost, my ass.

90
00:07:18,396 --> 00:07:19,730
Tell us who you are!

91
00:07:20,356 --> 00:07:21,941
Don't hit me!

92
00:07:22,024 --> 00:07:24,986
How dare you when you're my tenants.

93
00:07:25,069 --> 00:07:26,362
You're our landlady?

94
00:07:32,994 --> 00:07:34,245
I'm sorry.

95
00:07:34,328 --> 00:07:36,539
I had no idea that my daughter

96
00:07:36,622 --> 00:07:39,083
had been doing this
to drive the tenants away.

97
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:43,337
I told you I wanted this place for myself.
I want to use it as my studio.

98
00:07:43,421 --> 00:07:44,672
Why must you rent it out?

99
00:07:44,755 --> 00:07:47,258
Why do you need one
when all you do is loaf around?

100
00:07:47,341 --> 00:07:48,843
That's hardly the case.

101
00:07:48,926 --> 00:07:52,847
I provide singing lessons
for the ladies of our neighborhood.

102
00:07:52,930 --> 00:07:56,100
So you had no idea
that this was happening.

103
00:07:56,684 --> 00:07:57,643
Of course not.

104
00:07:57,727 --> 00:08:00,563
If I had, I wouldn't have paid
for a pricey exorcism.

105
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:03,983
Hold on. Did you know about
this place being haunted then?

106
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,735
Well, you see--

107
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,946
No wonder the rent was questionably low.

108
00:08:09,655 --> 00:08:12,325
While you girls stay here,

109
00:08:12,408 --> 00:08:15,036
I promise not to raise
the deposit or rent,

110
00:08:15,119 --> 00:08:17,079
so please let it slide just this once.

111
00:08:17,163 --> 00:08:18,623
Lower the rent by 50,000 won.

112
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:21,250
But it's already lower
than the market price--

113
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:23,461
Mom, let's just call the police--

114
00:08:23,544 --> 00:08:27,465
Okay, fine. I'll lower the rent.
I'll do that, okay?

115
00:08:27,548 --> 00:08:30,801
-You imbecile! Get going.
-But Mom…

116
00:08:30,885 --> 00:08:33,471
You never do anything right, do you?

117
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:46,359
Hold on. Where did everyone go?

118
00:08:56,244 --> 00:08:57,662
What's everyone doing there?

119
00:08:59,455 --> 00:09:00,873
We're watching, so carry on.

120
00:09:01,832 --> 00:09:03,626
They're no help at all.

121
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,337
So you were going to
outnumber me, is that it?

122
00:09:07,004 --> 00:09:09,090
Seriously? Just leave if you're scared.

123
00:09:09,924 --> 00:09:11,634
Scared? Me?

124
00:09:11,717 --> 00:09:13,511
You know who I am anyway,

125
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:17,515
I'll give you a taste
of Hosu High's Captain Yang.

126
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,851
Get ready to have
your pretty teeth knocked out.

127
00:09:20,935 --> 00:09:24,188
It's been a while
since I've thrown my fists around.

128
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:28,067
I wasn't going to do this
with it being childish and all…

129
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,280
Take that!

130
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,201
Korean, Chinese, and western cuisine.

131
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:38,995
-Are you hungry?
-Not that!

132
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,080
Taekwondo, judo, kendo, and jiu-jitsu.

133
00:09:41,163 --> 00:09:42,498
See my degrees.

134
00:09:43,666 --> 00:09:46,460
Then I guess the fight won't be so boring.

135
00:09:47,670 --> 00:09:50,256
You guys are not to butt in.

136
00:09:50,339 --> 00:09:51,591
Got it.

137
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:54,302
This fight…

138
00:09:56,178 --> 00:09:58,514
-is for real.
-That's what I wanted too.

139
00:10:03,978 --> 00:10:06,647
I'm sorry, but can I ask
what this fight is about?

140
00:10:06,731 --> 00:10:08,524
I've been curious about that as well.

141
00:10:16,449 --> 00:10:20,286
By the way, is Anthony
falling for his first love again?

142
00:10:20,369 --> 00:10:23,247
Could be. But wasn't he
complaining earlier today?

143
00:10:23,331 --> 00:10:24,749
And what about him?

144
00:10:24,832 --> 00:10:27,376
Who is that certified cook?

145
00:10:27,460 --> 00:10:29,962
-Is he her boyfriend?
-I'm not sure,

146
00:10:30,046 --> 00:10:32,506
but he seems to be bothering Anthony.

147
00:10:32,590 --> 00:10:34,050
Darn it.

148
00:10:34,967 --> 00:10:37,970
This is only going to make
our lives harder, isn't it?

149
00:10:43,809 --> 00:10:45,019
Unbelievable.

150
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:50,608
The others are waiting,
so I'll cut to the chase.

151
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:54,737
Did you mean what you said earlier?
About liking Ha-ni.

152
00:10:55,780 --> 00:10:57,615
How is that any of your concern?

153
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,951
You're handsome enough
to meet any woman you want.

154
00:11:01,035 --> 00:11:05,081
So why are you suddenly hooked on
an older woman with a kid?

155
00:11:05,164 --> 00:11:08,000
-You know why better than anyone.
-What?

156
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,877
She's old and a single mother

157
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:11,587
but she's still cool and confident.

158
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,757
She's sweet and sees me the way I am
without any prejudice.

159
00:11:15,549 --> 00:11:19,512
Also, I don't care about
your past relationship with her.

160
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:23,265
But if you're thinking about messing
with her with feelings you've once had,

161
00:11:26,310 --> 00:11:27,311
then get lost.

162
00:11:29,105 --> 00:11:31,440
Feelings I once had? What about you, then?

163
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:38,697
Me? Well, I'm dead serious now.

164
00:11:40,157 --> 00:11:42,535
It's why I've decided
to be the old lady's…

165
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,788
I mean, Bahn Ha-ni's

166
00:11:47,164 --> 00:11:48,582
Superman.

167
00:11:53,754 --> 00:11:54,839
Superman?

168
00:11:57,967 --> 00:12:01,011
How corny. I'd at least be Ironman.

169
00:12:24,869 --> 00:12:25,995
Who is it?

170
00:12:29,123 --> 00:12:30,416
Hold on.

171
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,918
Why are you back here?

172
00:12:33,002 --> 00:12:35,379
To help you clean up.

173
00:12:35,463 --> 00:12:38,382
How nice of you to get here
after we're all done.

174
00:12:38,466 --> 00:12:39,425
Nicely done.

175
00:12:41,051 --> 00:12:42,386
I'm glad you're here.

176
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:44,430
I had something to discuss with you.

177
00:12:44,513 --> 00:12:45,514
What is it?

178
00:12:45,598 --> 00:12:48,893
I have an idea for the contest.

179
00:12:53,814 --> 00:12:56,108
So you want to come up with a snack

180
00:12:56,192 --> 00:12:58,569
that can be consumed
by those who can't eat them?

181
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:02,698
Do you remember that boy who got sick?

182
00:13:02,781 --> 00:13:06,202
Oh, him. He had an allergic reaction
to the snack I gave him.

183
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:10,664
I was reminded of that incident
thanks to Chun-sik getting sick

184
00:13:10,748 --> 00:13:12,166
at the chicken restaurant.

185
00:13:12,833 --> 00:13:14,877
Who knew he'd be of help?

186
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,295
Anyway, I like the idea.

187
00:13:18,005 --> 00:13:20,341
Well, I think it's good as well.

188
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,801
But won't the target market be too small?

189
00:13:23,385 --> 00:13:27,515
That's why the snack must be tasty as well
for everyone to enjoy.

190
00:13:28,807 --> 00:13:29,767
Right.

191
00:13:29,850 --> 00:13:30,726
That's right.

192
00:13:30,809 --> 00:13:32,520
This is what I love about snacks.

193
00:13:32,603 --> 00:13:34,813
-You open one bag like this and…
-That's right.

194
00:13:34,897 --> 00:13:37,024
-…enjoy it together.
-Enjoy it together.

195
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:39,151
Try this one.

196
00:13:39,235 --> 00:13:40,528
Here you go.

197
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,533
-This is also a snack.
-This is really good!

198
00:13:45,616 --> 00:13:48,202
-What is this?
-I found it in a store.

199
00:13:51,997 --> 00:13:54,959
Yu-hyeon, why are you so upset today?

200
00:13:55,751 --> 00:13:56,835
I hate Dad.

201
00:13:56,919 --> 00:14:00,005
He promised to come home early
and play with me, but he's late again.

202
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,552
I see it's because you miss your dad.

203
00:14:04,635 --> 00:14:06,845
He must love the company more.

204
00:14:07,805 --> 00:14:09,181
He always lies to me.

205
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:11,267
That's not it.

206
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:13,060
Your father loves you dearly.

207
00:14:14,061 --> 00:14:15,396
It's just that

208
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,775
he's spending a lot of his time
making snacks to make people happy.

209
00:14:22,444 --> 00:14:24,238
To make people happy?

210
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:27,908
With snacks?

211
00:14:31,370 --> 00:14:33,455
This is my favorite.

212
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:45,509
-What is it?
-Nothing.

213
00:14:47,595 --> 00:14:49,013
When shall we begin then?

214
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:53,392
We'll start researching tomorrow,
come up with a recipe,

215
00:14:53,475 --> 00:14:55,352
and a design. Then we'll make a sample.

216
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:57,980
We'll start tomorrow then.

217
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:02,192
You know I only accept first place, right?

218
00:15:02,276 --> 00:15:03,319
Unless it's my grades.

219
00:15:03,402 --> 00:15:05,613
Anyway, let's give it our all.

220
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,783
-We can do it!
-We can do it!

221
00:15:28,302 --> 00:15:31,472
Who the hell is it
this early in the morning?

222
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,393
-Who is it?
-It's me.

223
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:40,689
What the hell?

224
00:15:41,398 --> 00:15:43,567
What are you doing here this early?

225
00:15:44,151 --> 00:15:44,985
What?

226
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,449
It's time to go to work.

227
00:15:51,992 --> 00:15:55,663
But it's only five in the morning.

228
00:15:55,746 --> 00:15:58,374
We agreed to get started on our project.

229
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:01,043
Brainstorming in the morning
will wake us up.

230
00:16:01,126 --> 00:16:03,545
I'll wait outside, so get ready for work.

231
00:16:08,467 --> 00:16:09,593
What is going on?

232
00:16:18,769 --> 00:16:21,313
-Here you go.
-What is it?

233
00:16:21,397 --> 00:16:24,274
Hot tea. It'll warm you up in no time.

234
00:16:28,821 --> 00:16:29,738
Thanks.

235
00:16:36,954 --> 00:16:39,873
Old lady. What shampoo do you use?

236
00:16:41,208 --> 00:16:42,626
Why do you ask?

237
00:16:42,710 --> 00:16:45,045
No reason. You smell nice.

238
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,941
You should hold on to that
if you don't want to fall.

239
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,658
KITCHEN

240
00:17:15,659 --> 00:17:17,828
We'll brainstorm over a light breakfast.

241
00:17:19,830 --> 00:17:20,873
Here.

242
00:17:26,170 --> 00:17:28,172
-Thank you.
-Sure.

243
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:34,136
Last night, I did some research
based on your idea.

244
00:17:34,219 --> 00:17:35,387
Take a look.

245
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:42,394
-Didn't you sleep?
-No.

246
00:17:42,978 --> 00:17:45,939
According to my research,
flour contains gluten,

247
00:17:46,023 --> 00:17:48,776
which is mainly why
people can't eat snacks.

248
00:17:48,859 --> 00:17:51,528
There aren't a lot of gluten-free products
in Korea,

249
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:55,365
but there are many gluten-free products
in the overseas market…

250
00:17:58,702 --> 00:17:59,536
What's wrong?

251
00:18:00,746 --> 00:18:03,207
No, it's nothing. Keep going.

252
00:18:05,292 --> 00:18:06,418
I forgot.

253
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:20,182
Who is it this time?

254
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:25,854
Ha-ni.

255
00:18:32,361 --> 00:18:34,238
-Where's your mom?
-She went to work.

256
00:18:34,321 --> 00:18:35,322
Already?

257
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:39,284
She left with Blue Bird
early in the morning.

258
00:18:39,368 --> 00:18:40,494
Who's Blue Bird?

259
00:18:40,577 --> 00:18:43,455
The guy you were fighting with yesterday.
The tall guy.

260
00:18:44,623 --> 00:18:45,707
That jerk.

261
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,878
So here's what I think.
Gluten-free flour is nice,

262
00:18:49,962 --> 00:18:52,005
but they're hard to find in Korea.

263
00:18:52,089 --> 00:18:56,009
So why don't we just find
a new ingredient to use as a base?

264
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,721
For example, rice or beans.
They could work nicely.

265
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:03,016
-I think that's a good idea.
-Right?

266
00:19:04,268 --> 00:19:07,604
I'll also do research
whenever I can at work.

267
00:19:07,688 --> 00:19:08,564
Okay.

268
00:19:09,189 --> 00:19:11,358
Wait up. I'll walk you to your office.

269
00:19:13,819 --> 00:19:14,778
No, it's okay.

270
00:19:14,862 --> 00:19:16,822
I don't want to say goodbye just yet.

271
00:19:21,368 --> 00:19:22,953
Hello, ladies.

272
00:19:26,999 --> 00:19:28,000
Who are you?

273
00:19:30,127 --> 00:19:33,005
I'll explain later.

274
00:19:33,672 --> 00:19:35,090
Let's go, Old Lady.

275
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:37,009
I'll see you again.

276
00:19:40,929 --> 00:19:41,972
"Old Lady"?

277
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,814
Old Lady, get in.

278
00:19:58,780 --> 00:19:59,740
Hey.

279
00:19:59,823 --> 00:20:02,326
Do you want to eat lunch
and go for a walk in the park?

280
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:05,996
I'm working outside the office today.

281
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:07,581
Really?

282
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:09,875
Then let's go home together.

283
00:20:09,958 --> 00:20:11,919
I won't be dropping by the office.

284
00:20:13,545 --> 00:20:16,381
Then let's brainstorm together
over some chicken and beer.

285
00:20:20,260 --> 00:20:22,137
-I should go now.
-Okay.

286
00:20:23,305 --> 00:20:25,515
-I'll call you.
-Okay.

287
00:20:30,437 --> 00:20:32,981
-I should go back down.
-I'm going up.

288
00:20:34,191 --> 00:20:35,400
When did you get in here?

289
00:20:35,484 --> 00:20:38,487
I told you to pay off your debt,
but you're busy hitting on a girl.

290
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:41,031
All I need to do is keep my promise.

291
00:20:41,114 --> 00:20:44,159
Why do you care if I hit on a girl or not?

292
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:45,619
That's none of your business.

293
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:46,703
Tell me something.

294
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:50,040
Are you entering the contest with her?

295
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,002
Don't tell me you're even going to take
my prize money from me.

296
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:56,171
-"Prize money"?
-Yes.

297
00:20:57,589 --> 00:21:00,759
What makes you think you'll win?

298
00:21:04,388 --> 00:21:05,389
Watch out!

299
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:08,392
Watch out! I'm going to win
and take all of your money!

300
00:21:11,144 --> 00:21:12,229
Gosh.

301
00:21:17,067 --> 00:21:21,280
CHAIRMAN HAN JI-MAN

302
00:21:21,363 --> 00:21:24,700
I sent her to the Product Development Team
hoping to improve things there,

303
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:28,495
but she even managed
to do something to him.

304
00:21:29,663 --> 00:21:33,250
My goodness, what an incredible woman.

305
00:21:36,295 --> 00:21:37,587
The coffee's gone cold.

306
00:21:42,551 --> 00:21:43,635
Gyeong-sik.

307
00:21:44,761 --> 00:21:46,221
Look for a place in Ha-ni's neighborhood.

308
00:21:48,056 --> 00:21:50,183
Somewhere close to her place.

309
00:21:50,267 --> 00:21:51,310
Are you going to move?

310
00:21:51,393 --> 00:21:54,813
No, actually, let's just move
our office to her neighborhood.

311
00:21:55,981 --> 00:21:58,817
We should talk about it with Mr. Park.

312
00:21:58,900 --> 00:22:00,694
Anthony!

313
00:22:00,777 --> 00:22:04,656
Anthony! I have great news for you!

314
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:07,534
-What is it?
-The volunteer work brought us luck.

315
00:22:08,035 --> 00:22:09,369
Do they want an interview?

316
00:22:09,453 --> 00:22:10,954
No, the local government PR Team

317
00:22:11,038 --> 00:22:14,166
called and asked if you could be
their honorary ambassador.

318
00:22:15,125 --> 00:22:16,835
Which local government?

319
00:22:16,918 --> 00:22:19,421
Your old neighborhood
where Hosu High School is.

320
00:22:19,504 --> 00:22:22,174
Hosu High School? I know that place.

321
00:22:23,842 --> 00:22:26,803
-What are you doing here?
-She told me you offered her something.

322
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:28,347
I brought her from Ha-ni's place
this morning.

323
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:29,681
-Me?
-Well, it wasn't me.

324
00:22:44,613 --> 00:22:46,281
This smells amazing.

325
00:22:46,364 --> 00:22:48,116
You just need to microwave it.

326
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,118
It's like I'm at a restaurant.

327
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,120
The world has gotten so much better.

328
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:05,884
It even tastes amazing. This is great.

329
00:23:08,595 --> 00:23:10,222
Are you really going to manage her?

330
00:23:10,305 --> 00:23:12,099
Are you out of your mind?

331
00:23:12,182 --> 00:23:15,060
-It's all for you.
-How exactly?

332
00:23:15,143 --> 00:23:16,937
If we sign a deal with her,

333
00:23:17,020 --> 00:23:19,981
you'll get to meet her mom often.

334
00:23:28,532 --> 00:23:30,617
-Do you think so?
-Of course.

335
00:23:30,700 --> 00:23:32,577
And if we give her a big down payment,

336
00:23:32,661 --> 00:23:35,122
it'll help them become
more stable financially.

337
00:23:37,457 --> 00:23:41,586
Then let me teach her who's boss
before you sign her.

338
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:42,546
You do that.

339
00:23:55,016 --> 00:23:56,309
What are you doing?

340
00:23:59,062 --> 00:24:00,647
She was hungry.

341
00:24:03,233 --> 00:24:04,359
Here's your water.

342
00:24:04,442 --> 00:24:07,779
Hey, kid. Do you have no hands?
Why are you slaving him around?

343
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,782
I never asked him to do anything.
He just did it for me.

344
00:24:12,534 --> 00:24:13,743
Stand up.

345
00:24:15,245 --> 00:24:16,538
Are you a slave?

346
00:24:16,621 --> 00:24:18,582
Why don't you just feed her?

347
00:24:18,665 --> 00:24:20,167
But this is how I treat you.

348
00:24:20,250 --> 00:24:21,877
She and I are different--

349
00:24:21,960 --> 00:24:24,004
Will you stop yelling when I'm eating?

350
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:35,515
Gosh, there's dust everywhere.

351
00:24:35,599 --> 00:24:36,766
Sorry.

352
00:24:40,896 --> 00:24:42,814
-I have something to tell you.
-Go on.

353
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:46,234
If you want to sign with us,
you need to stick to some rules.

354
00:24:47,194 --> 00:24:49,362
-First, respect me--
-I won't sign then.

355
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,158
No, you don't need to respect me.

356
00:24:55,327 --> 00:24:57,037
Just treat me with manners…

357
00:25:02,125 --> 00:25:03,585
Eat up. Chew slowly.

358
00:25:22,729 --> 00:25:26,149
When you taste a snack,
you need to use all five senses.

359
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,610
From the moment you bite
to the moment you swallow.

360
00:25:29,194 --> 00:25:32,614
You need to try and taste everything
step by step.

361
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,953
At first, it's just sweet.

362
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:40,205
But as I keep chewing,
it starts to taste salty.

363
00:25:40,288 --> 00:25:43,166
Right? It's called "sweet and salty."

364
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:45,377
Those two things need to stay in harmony

365
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,672
so that people won't stop
eating our snacks.

366
00:25:49,798 --> 00:25:51,800
Back when I used to work at a supermarket,

367
00:25:51,883 --> 00:25:55,512
I could tell what kind of snacks the kids
liked just by looking at their faces.

368
00:25:55,595 --> 00:25:57,806
Kids can't lie.

369
00:25:57,889 --> 00:26:00,934
So if they don't like what they taste,
they just leave right away.

370
00:26:01,768 --> 00:26:03,853
You guys will be
doing market research later.

371
00:26:03,937 --> 00:26:05,563
I guess you'll be of great help.

372
00:26:05,647 --> 00:26:07,357
Not at all.

373
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:10,151
All I did was work at a supermarket.

374
00:26:11,278 --> 00:26:13,738
The field is the best place
to learn things.

375
00:26:14,823 --> 00:26:17,534
These are the notes I took
back when I was in sales.

376
00:26:18,285 --> 00:26:21,121
I'm sure it'll help you out
when you do your work.

377
00:26:22,497 --> 00:26:23,873
Thank you.

378
00:26:25,166 --> 00:26:26,251
Are you serious?

379
00:26:26,334 --> 00:26:28,586
You didn't even flinch
when we begged you for that.

380
00:26:28,670 --> 00:26:31,047
She's right.
You told me that's confidential.

381
00:26:31,631 --> 00:26:34,342
-Gosh, this is upsetting.
-Why is it upsetting?

382
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,721
I can do what I want with it.
It's none of your business.

383
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:42,517
Tasting snacks on an empty stomach
made me feel greasy inside.

384
00:26:43,226 --> 00:26:44,936
Ms. Oh, let's go eat.

385
00:26:45,729 --> 00:26:47,147
I have a lunch appointment.

386
00:26:47,230 --> 00:26:48,940
Is that so?

387
00:26:49,024 --> 00:26:51,318
-Ms. Bahn, let's go.
-Okay.

388
00:26:51,401 --> 00:26:53,278
I'll see you guys downstairs.

389
00:26:53,361 --> 00:26:54,404
Come on.

390
00:26:57,073 --> 00:26:58,033
What was that?

391
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,452
He used to scold her
for being incompetent.

392
00:27:00,535 --> 00:27:04,456
-What's with him?
-The lunch menu is jjamppong.

393
00:27:04,539 --> 00:27:06,708
Gosh, spicy food
isn't good for the tongue.

394
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:08,460
I'm talking about work,

395
00:27:08,543 --> 00:27:09,961
but you're talking about food?

396
00:27:10,045 --> 00:27:13,423
You weren't talking about work.
You were chewing out Ms. Bahn.

397
00:27:14,924 --> 00:27:15,925
What did you say?

398
00:27:16,718 --> 00:27:18,803
I don't even chew on gum
to protect my jaws.

399
00:27:19,304 --> 00:27:20,597
Why would I chew her out?

400
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,599
Stop making me look bad.

401
00:27:24,934 --> 00:27:26,269
Why do you always…

402
00:27:27,562 --> 00:27:29,439
Gosh. I'll see you after lunch, Ms. Oh.

403
00:27:29,522 --> 00:27:30,357
Come here.

404
00:27:49,209 --> 00:27:52,420
THE IMPORTANCE OF TASTING

405
00:27:54,589 --> 00:27:59,469
BLUEBERRY, SUGAR PALM

406
00:28:03,056 --> 00:28:04,974
CRANBERRY, MANDARIN

407
00:28:23,743 --> 00:28:25,495
Hey, Do-yun.

408
00:28:26,913 --> 00:28:29,999
I think I need to go to the hospital.

409
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:36,381
Everything will be fine. Don't worry.

410
00:28:50,186 --> 00:28:53,815
The size of your fibroid didn't increase
as you were worrying.

411
00:28:53,898 --> 00:28:55,066
I see.

412
00:28:55,150 --> 00:28:59,320
But why does my lower abdomen
hurt so much?

413
00:29:00,155 --> 00:29:01,990
Did things get worse?

414
00:29:09,038 --> 00:29:12,417
Congratulations, you two.
You're six weeks pregnant.

415
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:15,044
What?

416
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:20,300
I'm pregnant?

417
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:22,594
Yes, this happens sometimes.

418
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:26,347
Couples give up on IVF
and decide to take it easy,

419
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,725
and they get naturally pregnant.

420
00:29:30,435 --> 00:29:34,522
But didn't you say that
it would be difficult for me

421
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:36,900
to get pregnant?

422
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:40,820
To be honest, your husband was fine.

423
00:29:41,613 --> 00:29:45,909
You were just exhausted
due to the constant IVF procedures.

424
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:47,494
That's why he told you that.

425
00:29:50,288 --> 00:29:51,164
Do-yun.

426
00:29:51,915 --> 00:29:53,291
What did I tell you?

427
00:29:53,374 --> 00:29:56,377
I told you our kid will come to us
if we kept waiting.

428
00:29:57,837 --> 00:29:58,922
Is this our baby?

429
00:30:11,768 --> 00:30:14,354
Do-yun. Do you remember?

430
00:30:15,188 --> 00:30:18,817
I drank quite a lot at our team dinner.

431
00:30:19,609 --> 00:30:20,693
Will that be all right?

432
00:30:20,777 --> 00:30:23,071
I'm sure it's fine.
Even the doctor said so.

433
00:30:24,030 --> 00:30:25,323
I hope so.

434
00:30:27,242 --> 00:30:29,494
-What is it?
-I…

435
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,838
I danced really aggressively
at the karaoke.

436
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:42,048
I did body waves and whatnot.

437
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,342
Will our baby be okay?

438
00:30:44,425 --> 00:30:46,719
It's fine. Just be careful from now on.

439
00:30:46,803 --> 00:30:51,015
No, listen. I sang really loud
at the karaoke .

440
00:30:51,099 --> 00:30:52,976
I shouted and yelled.

441
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:57,647
What if our baby heard that
and was shocked?

442
00:30:58,439 --> 00:31:00,233
Gosh, what am I going to do with you?

443
00:31:01,359 --> 00:31:02,944
You're still like a baby to me.

444
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:04,737
How will you become a mother?

445
00:31:07,657 --> 00:31:09,909
A mother?

446
00:31:12,704 --> 00:31:13,538
Me?

447
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:22,672
Am I really going to be a mother?

448
00:31:24,424 --> 00:31:25,466
Ji-eun.

449
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,511
What did you say you want to become
in 20 years?

450
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:31,139
I want to become a good mother.

451
00:31:31,931 --> 00:31:33,016
A good mother?

452
00:31:33,933 --> 00:31:34,893
What's a good mother?

453
00:31:37,395 --> 00:31:40,607
Instead of dying early like my mom did,

454
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,026
I want to pack lunches

455
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,820
and chat with my kid after school.

456
00:31:46,696 --> 00:31:50,700
And when it rains, I'll wait outside
with an umbrella in my hand.

457
00:31:52,076 --> 00:31:54,787
I want to be a mom
who's always there for my child,

458
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:58,291
so that they won't be lonely like me.

459
00:32:01,544 --> 00:32:02,670
My goodness.

460
00:32:06,633 --> 00:32:08,134
It really came to us.

461
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:19,354
Our baby.

462
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:32,075
Chairman Han owns 24 percent
of the company shares.

463
00:32:32,158 --> 00:32:35,244
And with those who are in favor,
it adds up to 62 percent.

464
00:32:36,829 --> 00:32:40,208
If you take away the 20 percent I own,

465
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,710
that only leaves him with 42 percent.

466
00:32:43,294 --> 00:32:44,170
Yes.

467
00:32:44,837 --> 00:32:48,257
But even if we gather
all the possible shares,

468
00:32:48,341 --> 00:32:50,718
it only amounts to 40 percent.

469
00:32:51,970 --> 00:32:54,222
Is there a way to increase
the number of shares?

470
00:32:54,305 --> 00:32:57,058
We'll do our best to buy the shares
in the market.

471
00:32:57,141 --> 00:32:59,435
But if they do the same,

472
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:02,105
we can't guarantee anything
with the money we have.

473
00:33:11,823 --> 00:33:12,991
So I've been thinking.

474
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:17,453
I wanted to make you a tough offer.

475
00:33:18,329 --> 00:33:19,497
Go ahead.

476
00:33:21,165 --> 00:33:23,668
We can plummet the share price
of Joa Confectionary.

477
00:33:23,751 --> 00:33:26,462
We can then buy all the shares
for sale on the market.

478
00:33:27,839 --> 00:33:30,550
Do you think you can do that?

479
00:33:30,633 --> 00:33:32,677
If something bad happens to the company,

480
00:33:33,261 --> 00:33:35,096
it will reflect on the stock market.

481
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:45,732
Everyone you offered the CEO position to
has turned down the offer.

482
00:33:49,318 --> 00:33:52,030
If they all turned me down,
there's nothing I can do.

483
00:33:58,578 --> 00:34:00,621
I'll have to keep looking.

484
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:36,365
-Hey, new boy.
-Yes?

485
00:34:36,449 --> 00:34:38,951
Will you snap out of it?

486
00:34:39,035 --> 00:34:40,828
You've had bloodshot eyes all day.

487
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:45,249
I'm sorry.
I didn't get any sleep last night.

488
00:34:45,333 --> 00:34:47,585
I don't know what you do at night,

489
00:34:47,668 --> 00:34:50,546
but this is your workplace,
so you need to work harder.

490
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:51,714
-Of course.
-Of course!

491
00:34:51,798 --> 00:34:53,716
-Gosh.
-I'm sorry.

492
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,593
I'll go splash my face with cold water.

493
00:34:56,928 --> 00:34:58,721
What are you doing after work today?

494
00:34:58,805 --> 00:35:02,183
I'll treat you to dinner.
Should we have some beef ribs?

495
00:35:02,266 --> 00:35:05,812
Sure. I'll chew them
until my new dental implants fall off.

496
00:35:17,698 --> 00:35:18,741
Hello.

497
00:35:18,825 --> 00:35:22,578
I'll be managing the cafeteria
starting from today. I'm Cha Seung-seok.

498
00:35:23,162 --> 00:35:24,247
You moved here?

499
00:35:24,330 --> 00:35:26,666
Isn't he that the guy
who did the dishes last time?

500
00:35:26,749 --> 00:35:29,127
You're right. But why would he manage
the cafeteria?

501
00:35:29,210 --> 00:35:30,837
Hey. What's going on?

502
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,296
I…

503
00:35:34,257 --> 00:35:37,301
I was demoted for misusing
the company credit card.

504
00:35:37,385 --> 00:35:39,846
Gosh. Why did you do such a thing?

505
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:42,765
You're the one who wanted
pork cutlets over the weekend!

506
00:35:44,642 --> 00:35:45,852
Be quiet.

507
00:35:45,935 --> 00:35:48,729
Those ladies are upset right now,
so we'll talk next time.

508
00:35:53,276 --> 00:35:55,444
Why are you just standing there?

509
00:35:55,528 --> 00:35:57,029
Come prepare these anchovies.

510
00:35:57,113 --> 00:35:59,031
-Sorry?
-Come here this instant.

511
00:35:59,657 --> 00:36:00,658
Yes, ma'am.

512
00:36:03,202 --> 00:36:04,120
Thank you.

513
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:05,496
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

514
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:11,002
By the way, where did Ms. Bahn
disappear to this time?

515
00:36:11,085 --> 00:36:13,254
They loved it and bought several at once.

516
00:36:13,754 --> 00:36:15,798
-Really?
-Yes. They loved it.

517
00:36:15,882 --> 00:36:17,008
-They're sold out?
-What?

518
00:36:17,091 --> 00:36:18,134
Is she slacking off?

519
00:36:19,927 --> 00:36:21,387
-Really?
-They liked it.

520
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:22,722
-You're the best.
-Ms. Bahn.

521
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:25,266
What are you doing?

522
00:36:25,349 --> 00:36:28,436
I had to ask her about something.

523
00:36:29,145 --> 00:36:32,148
Do you think on-site surveys are a joke?

524
00:36:32,231 --> 00:36:35,693
That's not it. They were doing
a three-hour sampling event

525
00:36:35,776 --> 00:36:38,362
for our company's new product.

526
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:41,699
-But the event ended after one hour.
-That shouldn't happen.

527
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:44,869
I mean…

528
00:36:45,494 --> 00:36:48,206
How could they end the event
in just an hour?

529
00:36:48,289 --> 00:36:49,916
That's not it.

530
00:36:50,666 --> 00:36:54,503
If a sampling event has ended
sooner than expected,

531
00:36:54,587 --> 00:36:57,340
that means the mart has already sold
all of the products.

532
00:36:59,008 --> 00:37:02,386
Then have our snacks been sold out?

533
00:37:03,179 --> 00:37:04,138
Yes.

534
00:37:04,222 --> 00:37:07,934
I asked her and she told me
that the customers loved it

535
00:37:08,017 --> 00:37:10,186
and bought them every time they tried it.

536
00:37:11,103 --> 00:37:12,355
And as a result…

537
00:37:15,483 --> 00:37:17,026
it's sold out.

538
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:21,113
I guess we don't need to do
this on-site survey anymore.

539
00:37:21,197 --> 00:37:22,365
You're right.

540
00:37:22,448 --> 00:37:25,284
By the way, how did you know
about the sampling event?

541
00:37:25,368 --> 00:37:28,621
I had gone to the staff room
to check the amount of snacks

542
00:37:28,704 --> 00:37:31,249
and checked
at the sampling event schedule.

543
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:34,502
I heard you worked at a mart before.

544
00:37:34,585 --> 00:37:36,087
I guess you had it locked down.

545
00:37:37,004 --> 00:37:40,341
-"Locked down"?
-You've had it under control.

546
00:37:42,051 --> 00:37:42,885
It's a compliment.

547
00:37:45,096 --> 00:37:46,973
-Thank you.
-All right, then.

548
00:37:47,056 --> 00:37:50,142
Let's check the sales volume
for the other snacks and call it a day.

549
00:37:50,226 --> 00:37:51,477
Okay.

550
00:37:53,688 --> 00:37:55,106
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

551
00:37:59,068 --> 00:38:00,069
Hi, Mom.

552
00:38:00,152 --> 00:38:03,406
Can you stop by Ha-yeong's place
this evening?

553
00:38:03,990 --> 00:38:04,949
Ha-yeong's place?

554
00:38:05,658 --> 00:38:07,618
Are you in Seoul?

555
00:38:09,370 --> 00:38:13,541
We decided to admit your grandma
to a nursing hospital in Seoul.

556
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:15,835
She'll move in as soon as
there's a vacancy,

557
00:38:15,918 --> 00:38:18,087
so you should come see her before that.

558
00:38:19,755 --> 00:38:23,050
Okay. I'll be there.

559
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:31,809
Hey, where are you?

560
00:38:32,893 --> 00:38:34,270
I'm doing something outside.

561
00:38:34,353 --> 00:38:35,980
What could you possibly be doing?

562
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,692
-Ha-ni?
-Gosh. Go away.

563
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:43,988
What is it?

564
00:38:45,614 --> 00:38:46,615
Mom?

565
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:49,201
Okay.

566
00:38:51,912 --> 00:38:53,080
Cassette tape?

567
00:38:53,914 --> 00:38:55,124
Suit yourself.

568
00:38:59,587 --> 00:39:01,797
-What did she say?
-What's it to you?

569
00:39:07,261 --> 00:39:08,262
It looks good.

570
00:39:09,055 --> 00:39:11,098
Let's go with this contract.

571
00:39:11,182 --> 00:39:12,099
MANAGEMENT CONTRACT

572
00:39:12,892 --> 00:39:14,602
Okay, then.

573
00:39:14,685 --> 00:39:18,064
We'll set a date soon
to sign the contract,

574
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:19,774
so make sure to bring your mom.

575
00:39:21,067 --> 00:39:22,068
What?

576
00:39:23,444 --> 00:39:25,196
Why her?

577
00:39:25,279 --> 00:39:27,698
You're a minor, so you need to bring
a guardian.

578
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,451
I see. Well…

579
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:33,287
Can I just bring her seal?

580
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,332
What's wrong? Is she busy with work?

581
00:39:37,875 --> 00:39:40,753
Well, that too.

582
00:39:40,836 --> 00:39:42,546
It can't be helped then.

583
00:39:42,630 --> 00:39:45,549
I'll wait in front of her company building

584
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:47,093
and bring her here.

585
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,220
Gosh, I can't believe I'm doing this.

586
00:39:49,303 --> 00:39:50,513
Forget it.

587
00:40:00,815 --> 00:40:03,484
What are you doing? People might see us!

588
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:05,361
What? There's no one around us.

589
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:08,864
By the way, is my princess craving
some pasta?

590
00:40:08,948 --> 00:40:12,326
We're getting off work early
for once today.

591
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:15,371
I was going to go to your house

592
00:40:16,497 --> 00:40:18,207
and cook you something tasty.

593
00:40:20,709 --> 00:40:21,961
I can't wait!

594
00:40:23,963 --> 00:40:25,714
Goodness, who was it?

595
00:40:25,798 --> 00:40:28,551
Who seduced this pretty, little baby?

596
00:40:28,634 --> 00:40:30,803
-It was you.
-Was it me?

597
00:40:30,886 --> 00:40:33,764
Don't do this. What if people see us?

598
00:40:33,848 --> 00:40:36,517
Don't you worry. There's no one here

599
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:37,768
except for Ms. Bahn.

600
00:40:49,697 --> 00:40:50,781
Ms. Bahn.

601
00:40:54,535 --> 00:40:55,536
Ms. Bahn.

602
00:40:56,579 --> 00:40:57,997
Wait.

603
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:59,290
Ms. Bahn.

604
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,083
Ms. Bahn.

605
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,710
Ms. Bahn.

606
00:41:02,793 --> 00:41:04,503
Ms. Bahn!

607
00:41:04,587 --> 00:41:07,548
Ha-ni.

608
00:41:07,631 --> 00:41:09,133
I'm begging you.

609
00:41:09,717 --> 00:41:12,636
They can't know about this.

610
00:41:12,720 --> 00:41:15,764
Please keep this a secret.

611
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:19,143
Why? Aren't you allowed to
date fellow employees?

612
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:22,188
That's not it.

613
00:41:22,855 --> 00:41:25,316
People will start talking
if they find out.

614
00:41:26,066 --> 00:41:28,444
And if we break up,

615
00:41:28,527 --> 00:41:30,905
I'll be the one who suffers
the biggest loss.

616
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:34,950
Don't you worry. I won't tell a soul.

617
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:40,706
Thank you. I truly mean it.

618
00:41:40,789 --> 00:41:43,000
Whatever you ask me to do from now on,

619
00:41:43,083 --> 00:41:45,461
I'll do it. Just tell me anything.

620
00:41:45,544 --> 00:41:46,712
Salute!

621
00:41:55,054 --> 00:41:56,639
TOFU

622
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:24,708
Hey, what's up?

623
00:42:24,792 --> 00:42:27,044
I found a base ingredient
that we could use.

624
00:42:27,127 --> 00:42:29,505
-What is it?
-Tofu.

625
00:42:30,089 --> 00:42:31,924
How about we make a snack out of tofu?

626
00:42:32,007 --> 00:42:33,926
That sounds good.

627
00:42:34,009 --> 00:42:36,595
Should we give it a try today after work?

628
00:42:36,679 --> 00:42:39,640
I'm a little bit busy this evening.

629
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,976
How about tomorrow?

630
00:42:42,059 --> 00:42:44,478
Okay. We'll talk again tomorrow.

631
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:45,938
Bye.

632
00:42:48,315 --> 00:42:50,401
Hey, Do-yun. What's up?

633
00:42:51,026 --> 00:42:53,696
This is refreshing. Have some.

634
00:42:53,779 --> 00:42:56,657
I was looking forward to
having you buy me dinner.

635
00:42:57,283 --> 00:42:59,076
But this restaurant is tacky.

636
00:42:59,785 --> 00:43:03,080
This is where your dad taught me
how to drink for the first time.

637
00:43:03,163 --> 00:43:04,540
My dad did?

638
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,750
Yes. I was so wasted that night

639
00:43:06,834 --> 00:43:08,794
that he had to carry me home on his back.

640
00:43:08,877 --> 00:43:11,964
Gosh, that old man must have fed you
a gallon.

641
00:43:12,798 --> 00:43:15,050
I drank because I wanted to. I was happy.

642
00:43:16,343 --> 00:43:19,013
I envied you back then

643
00:43:19,722 --> 00:43:23,017
for having a dad who taught you
how to drink and also about life.

644
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:26,437
I guess that's how people are.

645
00:43:27,313 --> 00:43:30,649
We always yearn for things

646
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:31,817
that we don't have.

647
00:43:33,527 --> 00:43:36,697
What's going on?
Why are you so emotional today?

648
00:43:36,780 --> 00:43:37,948
Is something wrong?

649
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:41,827
Since I grew up without a dad,

650
00:43:42,453 --> 00:43:44,538
I wonder if I could be a good one.

651
00:43:45,247 --> 00:43:47,833
I'm happy and afraid at the same time.

652
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:50,753
Hold on. What does this mean?

653
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:54,173
Don't tell me…

654
00:43:55,007 --> 00:43:57,176
That's right, you're going to be an uncle.

655
00:43:57,259 --> 00:43:59,762
Yes! I'm going to be an uncle!

656
00:44:01,013 --> 00:44:02,848
You did it!

657
00:44:02,931 --> 00:44:04,600
I'm going to be an uncle.

658
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:08,270
Don't tell my mom or your dad just yet.

659
00:44:08,354 --> 00:44:09,938
I'll tell them this weekend,

660
00:44:10,022 --> 00:44:12,858
-so make sure you come.
-You bet. Congratulations.

661
00:44:12,941 --> 00:44:14,443
I can guarantee this.

662
00:44:14,526 --> 00:44:18,447
You'll become the best dad ever.

663
00:44:22,701 --> 00:44:24,662
Thanks, Yu-hyeon.

664
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,121
Should we have some soju?

665
00:44:26,622 --> 00:44:27,623
Should we?

666
00:44:27,706 --> 00:44:28,999
One bottle of soju, please.

667
00:44:30,542 --> 00:44:32,461
I'm going to be an uncle.

668
00:44:38,217 --> 00:44:41,512
Mom, we'll clean up. Just rest.

669
00:44:43,013 --> 00:44:44,973
I feel bad.

670
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,769
I wonder if I'm only sending her away

671
00:44:49,395 --> 00:44:52,564
just to make my life easier.

672
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:54,566
You did everything you could.

673
00:44:55,234 --> 00:44:58,487
It's not good for her
to be in a taxi all day.

674
00:44:58,570 --> 00:45:01,407
That place is full of great doctors

675
00:45:01,490 --> 00:45:03,325
and has high-quality facilities.

676
00:45:03,992 --> 00:45:06,995
It'll be better for her too.

677
00:45:08,455 --> 00:45:11,917
Right. You're a smart girl.

678
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,377
I'm sure you're right.

679
00:45:14,753 --> 00:45:18,715
Mother, would you like some hot tea?

680
00:45:19,341 --> 00:45:20,467
No, thanks.

681
00:45:21,427 --> 00:45:23,679
I'm going to take a rest.

682
00:45:25,139 --> 00:45:28,142
Ha-yeong, you should rest up as well.

683
00:45:28,225 --> 00:45:29,601
I'll do the dishes.

684
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:31,728
We need to talk.

685
00:45:50,873 --> 00:45:51,915
How are you doing?

686
00:45:53,083 --> 00:45:56,336
I'm doing well.

687
00:45:57,629 --> 00:45:58,630
What about her?

688
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:00,883
Your daughter.

689
00:46:02,176 --> 00:46:04,386
She's also doing well.

690
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,224
You should be careful while Mom's here.

691
00:46:10,601 --> 00:46:11,810
Don't let her find out.

692
00:46:12,936 --> 00:46:14,855
Okay. I'll be careful.

693
00:46:14,938 --> 00:46:18,442
And even if Seong-u calls you,
don't meet with him.

694
00:46:19,151 --> 00:46:20,569
Especially not your daughter.

695
00:46:20,652 --> 00:46:22,905
Why? Is something going on with him?

696
00:46:22,988 --> 00:46:23,989
No, it's…

697
00:46:26,074 --> 00:46:27,951
You've confused him.

698
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:31,830
Okay. I'll do that.

699
00:46:32,372 --> 00:46:33,332
And…

700
00:46:35,709 --> 00:46:36,710
Here.

701
00:46:40,839 --> 00:46:42,299
A cassette player?

702
00:46:42,382 --> 00:46:44,510
Listen to it when you're alone.

703
00:46:45,802 --> 00:46:48,138
-Listen to the tape.
-What is it?

704
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:55,479
I'm too busy to listen to this.
Just tell me.

705
00:47:03,195 --> 00:47:07,366
This is the song
I listen to all the time in my cab.

706
00:47:07,449 --> 00:47:10,244
When you're feeling down,
Just sing like me

707
00:47:10,327 --> 00:47:12,829
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

708
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:16,375
Dad, are you tone-deaf?
You're a terrible singer.

709
00:47:16,458 --> 00:47:18,043
Who are you calling tone-deaf?

710
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:20,546
I sound better than them, don't I?

711
00:47:20,629 --> 00:47:22,798
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

712
00:47:22,881 --> 00:47:25,634
-This is--
-You said you wanted…

713
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,554
-Come on, Ha-ni.
-…to hear his voice.

714
00:47:29,346 --> 00:47:30,430
Where did you get this?

715
00:47:31,473 --> 00:47:33,892
I found it by chance.

716
00:47:33,976 --> 00:47:35,352
That's awful!

717
00:47:35,435 --> 00:47:36,770
Let's sing it once more.

718
00:47:36,853 --> 00:47:38,897
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

719
00:47:38,981 --> 00:47:41,275
Ha-yeong! Ha-ni!

720
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:44,861
-Mom.
-Where are you going this late at night?

721
00:47:45,821 --> 00:47:48,865
Your grandma has disappeared.

722
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:50,284
What do you mean?

723
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,035
She went into her room to rest.

724
00:47:52,119 --> 00:47:55,038
I had just gone to the bathroom.

725
00:47:55,122 --> 00:47:56,623
She must have left then.

726
00:47:56,707 --> 00:47:57,874
Mom, I'll go with you.

727
00:47:57,958 --> 00:47:59,668
I'll bring a coat. Wait for me.

728
00:47:59,751 --> 00:48:02,129
No. You and Seong-u should stay here.

729
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,839
She might come back.

730
00:48:03,922 --> 00:48:07,009
Okay. I'll call the police.

731
00:48:07,092 --> 00:48:08,302
Mother!

732
00:48:10,512 --> 00:48:11,722
Excuse me.

733
00:48:11,805 --> 00:48:14,641
Excuse me, but have you seen
an old lady nearby?

734
00:48:15,892 --> 00:48:17,436
What should I do?

735
00:48:17,519 --> 00:48:18,979
Mother!

736
00:48:19,062 --> 00:48:20,606
Grandma!

737
00:48:20,689 --> 00:48:22,482
Grandma!

738
00:48:25,527 --> 00:48:27,195
Grandma!

739
00:48:29,656 --> 00:48:31,325
-Grandma!
-Mother!

740
00:48:32,659 --> 00:48:34,328
Mother!

741
00:48:34,411 --> 00:48:35,704
What should we do, Ha-ni?

742
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:37,247
Grandma!

743
00:48:37,998 --> 00:48:39,291
-Mother…
-Grandma…

744
00:48:39,374 --> 00:48:40,917
Goodness.

745
00:48:41,001 --> 00:48:43,837
It's so cold. Where could she have gone?

746
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:46,882
Mom, does she have any close friends
in Seoul?

747
00:48:46,965 --> 00:48:49,009
No. She had left Seoul ages ago.

748
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:55,641
Hold on. Yes, Ha-yeong.

749
00:48:56,183 --> 00:48:57,100
What?

750
00:48:57,851 --> 00:49:00,145
The police haven't found anything?

751
00:49:03,565 --> 00:49:04,524
Okay.

752
00:49:08,111 --> 00:49:10,489
Where could she be this late at night?

753
00:49:11,573 --> 00:49:14,284
Mom. You don't think

754
00:49:15,494 --> 00:49:17,537
she went there, do you?

755
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:19,122
"There"?

756
00:49:24,127 --> 00:49:25,962
There. Be careful.

757
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:31,343
Grandma! Stop! It's dangerous!

758
00:49:31,426 --> 00:49:33,261
I have to save her this time.

759
00:49:33,345 --> 00:49:36,098
I have to save my dear Ha-ni.

760
00:49:36,181 --> 00:49:37,683
-Mom.
-Mother!

761
00:49:37,766 --> 00:49:39,726
How did you come all the way here?

762
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:42,104
Gi-tae.

763
00:49:42,187 --> 00:49:45,190
I'll make sure I save Ha-ni at all costs.

764
00:49:45,273 --> 00:49:48,443
You sacrificed your own life to save her.

765
00:49:48,527 --> 00:49:51,113
I won't let her go like this.

766
00:49:51,196 --> 00:49:53,490
Grandma. I'm here.

767
00:49:53,573 --> 00:49:55,534
I'm alive and well!

768
00:49:59,579 --> 00:50:02,624
Not you. I'm talking about Ha-ni.

769
00:50:02,708 --> 00:50:04,876
She's here right now!

770
00:50:06,545 --> 00:50:08,839
-Grandma.
-Mother.

771
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:14,469
What? Who are you?

772
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:18,807
Do you know me?

773
00:50:25,021 --> 00:50:26,898
It's cold. Let's go home.

774
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:47,169
I'm alive and well!

775
00:50:48,086 --> 00:50:51,006
Not you. I'm talking about Ha-ni.

776
00:50:51,089 --> 00:50:52,799
She's here right now!

777
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:05,771
How did she find her way there

778
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:08,648
when she forgets her own name
from time to time?

779
00:51:10,025 --> 00:51:14,571
That's because it's a memory
that she can't let go of.

780
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,408
Don't worry too much about her.

781
00:51:18,492 --> 00:51:19,951
Go home and rest up.

782
00:51:23,497 --> 00:51:25,957
I'm sorry, Mom.

783
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:29,377
I told you. It wasn't your fault.

784
00:51:30,712 --> 00:51:31,880
Still…

785
00:51:32,923 --> 00:51:37,135
You all got hurt
and suffered because of me.

786
00:51:43,975 --> 00:51:48,104
But you know what? From now on,
I'm going to live my life to the fullest.

787
00:51:48,688 --> 00:51:50,816
I'm no longer going to run away

788
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:52,526
or hide.

789
00:51:53,485 --> 00:51:56,822
I'm going to do my best
until the day I die.

790
00:51:59,241 --> 00:52:03,411
Because Dad's the only reason
I'm still alive to this day.

791
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:07,541
Ha-ni.

792
00:52:10,210 --> 00:52:13,505
So don't you worry about me anymore.

793
00:52:31,690 --> 00:52:34,276
She's definitely going to say no.

794
00:52:37,112 --> 00:52:38,488
I'm home.

795
00:52:39,531 --> 00:52:40,866
Hey, you're home.

796
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:47,831
-Hey.
-Yes?

797
00:52:47,914 --> 00:52:49,374
-What were you up to?
-What?

798
00:52:49,457 --> 00:52:52,752
Nothing. I wasn't doing much.

799
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,006
What are those? Snacks?

800
00:52:56,715 --> 00:52:57,924
We have plenty.

801
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,134
These aren't snacks.

802
00:52:59,676 --> 00:53:02,012
They're for the contest.

803
00:53:02,095 --> 00:53:03,179
What is it?

804
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,434
-Tofu.
-Tofu?

805
00:53:08,143 --> 00:53:10,979
-What for?
-We're going to make snacks with these.

806
00:53:11,980 --> 00:53:14,649
Is that even possible?

807
00:53:15,775 --> 00:53:17,319
Why is Mom in Seoul?

808
00:53:18,778 --> 00:53:21,323
Grandma will be admitted
to a nursing home.

809
00:53:22,157 --> 00:53:23,909
Her dementia got worse.

810
00:53:23,992 --> 00:53:26,369
How bad is it that she needs
to be admitted?

811
00:53:29,414 --> 00:53:33,001
Can I see her for just a while?

812
00:53:33,710 --> 00:53:35,629
What if Mom sees you?

813
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,088
Don't you dare!

814
00:53:37,172 --> 00:53:38,465
Fine.

815
00:53:47,474 --> 00:53:48,934
Anthony, we're here.

816
00:53:54,439 --> 00:53:55,774
I haven't been here in ages.

817
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,485
I remember crying a lot when leaving.

818
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,364
It is indeed nice to be back.

819
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:05,492
Mr. Park, Anthony's reputation
must have gotten better.

820
00:54:05,575 --> 00:54:07,661
Not everyone gets to be
an honorary ambassador.

821
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:08,703
Do you think so?

822
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:11,706
I didn't get an offer like this
even during my heyday.

823
00:54:12,749 --> 00:54:13,750
-Jeong-man.
-Yes?

824
00:54:13,833 --> 00:54:17,671
Do you think the word has spread
about this place being my hometown?

825
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,633
No, the chief of this district saw
how you volunteered at the shelter

826
00:54:22,217 --> 00:54:23,843
and was deeply moved. That's why.

827
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,595
Then I'm relieved.

828
00:54:26,096 --> 00:54:28,014
All that work for the article paid off.

829
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:31,059
-They must be waiting for you. Let's go.
-Okay.

830
00:54:31,142 --> 00:54:35,271
JUNGNANG-GU DISTRICT OFFICE

831
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:37,607
HONORARY AMBASSADOR
APPOINTMENT CEREMONY

832
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:40,860
I was greatly moved by how you volunteered
at the animal shelter.

833
00:54:40,944 --> 00:54:42,320
I did what needed to be done.

834
00:54:42,404 --> 00:54:44,739
I recently adopted a dog.

835
00:54:44,823 --> 00:54:48,159
I adopted him from the same shelter
you volunteered at.

836
00:54:48,243 --> 00:54:49,077
I see.

837
00:54:49,160 --> 00:54:52,580
-I even named him Thony.
-Sorry?

838
00:54:52,664 --> 00:54:55,917
He has large, fierce eyes and a face
that's identical to yours.

839
00:54:56,001 --> 00:54:59,879
Whenever I call his name,
he understands me and comes running.

840
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,965
He's so adorable.

841
00:55:04,801 --> 00:55:06,302
The chief is here.

842
00:55:07,512 --> 00:55:09,222
Hello, Anthony.

843
00:55:09,305 --> 00:55:10,140
Hello.

844
00:55:10,223 --> 00:55:12,392
-It's an honor to meet you.
-Likewise.

845
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:16,187
I appoint you as
the honorary ambassador of our district.

846
00:55:34,956 --> 00:55:37,667
We'll be filming our promotional video
in this sewing room.

847
00:55:37,751 --> 00:55:39,753
I didn't know you ran a place like this.

848
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,464
Our district has many facilities

849
00:55:42,547 --> 00:55:45,091
in the garment production industry.

850
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:47,886
We've made use of this
to launch a joint brand name

851
00:55:47,969 --> 00:55:49,846
with other sewing industries.

852
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,348
As you can see,
we make high-quality clothing

853
00:55:52,432 --> 00:55:54,309
and aim to go global in the future.

854
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:57,395
This will be a great spot
to film the promotional video.

855
00:55:57,479 --> 00:55:59,147
This place is for filming,

856
00:55:59,230 --> 00:56:01,483
but we do the photo shoot in the showroom.

857
00:56:01,566 --> 00:56:02,817
Jeong-man.

858
00:56:02,901 --> 00:56:06,154
Do we have a photo shoot
scheduled for this weekend?

859
00:56:06,237 --> 00:56:07,113
Yes. Why?

860
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,616
I want that little girl to watch me.

861
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:12,952
Right. Once she sees that,
she'll realize that you're a top star.

862
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:14,496
That's not it.

863
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:17,540
If we do that, her mom will have to come.

864
00:56:17,624 --> 00:56:19,709
Just wait and see.
I have it all planned out.

865
00:56:33,598 --> 00:56:34,724
By the way,

866
00:56:35,266 --> 00:56:38,394
are you sure we can cook here?

867
00:56:38,478 --> 00:56:40,980
Why not? This place is made for this.

868
00:56:41,064 --> 00:56:42,607
It's so spacious.

869
00:56:42,690 --> 00:56:44,859
There are all kinds of utensils.

870
00:56:44,943 --> 00:56:47,153
Right. You're right.

871
00:56:47,237 --> 00:56:49,864
But aren't these facilities prohibited
from personal use?

872
00:56:49,948 --> 00:56:51,533
It's okay.

873
00:56:51,616 --> 00:56:54,035
We're also employees here.

874
00:56:57,789 --> 00:57:00,250
It'll take some time to drain the tofu,

875
00:57:00,333 --> 00:57:01,709
so let's have breakfast.

876
00:57:01,793 --> 00:57:03,253
I brought some porridge.

877
00:57:11,094 --> 00:57:15,515
Yu-hyeon, I'm grateful.

878
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:20,478
But you don't need to do this.

879
00:57:21,521 --> 00:57:23,022
It's uncomfortable.

880
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,151
That's why I'm doing it.

881
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:29,237
What?

882
00:57:29,320 --> 00:57:32,198
That way, I'll be on your mind.

883
00:57:38,830 --> 00:57:40,874
Where are the spoons?

884
00:57:45,837 --> 00:57:47,213
That's all I ask of you

885
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,133
for now.

886
00:57:51,885 --> 00:57:53,887
Just keep thinking about me

887
00:57:55,889 --> 00:57:57,515
and how I keep being around you.

888
00:58:21,915 --> 00:58:24,083
-Should I make some ribs?
-That'd be nice too.

889
00:58:54,322 --> 00:58:55,448
Grandma.

890
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:01,162
Our stylish Ms. Lee Hong-nyeon.

891
00:59:02,747 --> 00:59:05,291
Why have you fallen so ill? Why?

892
00:59:08,836 --> 00:59:10,213
Where is it?

893
00:59:10,296 --> 00:59:12,048
What has gotten into you?

894
00:59:12,131 --> 00:59:13,633
-I'm sure it's at home.
-Really?

895
00:59:14,676 --> 00:59:16,844
Where did you leave your wallet?

896
00:59:16,928 --> 00:59:18,179
Beats me.

897
00:59:18,263 --> 00:59:20,848
I gave you my card for groceries.
Is it on the table?

898
00:59:22,850 --> 00:59:23,685
I found it.

899
00:59:24,269 --> 00:59:25,270
Let's go, Mom.

900
00:59:26,437 --> 00:59:28,690
-Gosh.
-You made me come all the way here.

901
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,078
Grandma.

902
00:59:52,547 --> 00:59:54,716
Is it you, my puppy?

903
01:00:36,924 --> 01:00:39,719
Keep this with you always.

904
01:00:39,802 --> 01:00:41,304
It's the only way you'll live.

905
01:00:41,387 --> 01:00:43,723
-Are you dating someone at work too?
-No, I'm not.

906
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:46,601
-A work colleague? Is that all?
-What?

907
01:00:46,684 --> 01:00:49,395
You should tell your family
before it's too late

908
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:52,565
-Not yet.
-Who did you come with?

909
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:53,858
I saw that guy just now.

910
01:00:54,359 --> 01:00:55,902
By the way, where's Dad?

911
01:00:55,985 --> 01:00:56,861
Where is she now?

912
01:00:57,445 --> 01:00:59,864
I've never seen Dad.

913
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:04,744
