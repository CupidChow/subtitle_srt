00:00:52,802 --> 00:00:54,596
EPISODE 2

2
00:01:02,103 --> 00:01:03,063
How great

3
00:01:04,022 --> 00:01:06,649
would it have been if my life had ended

4
00:01:06,733 --> 00:01:08,068
that day?

5
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,323
Then I wouldn't

6
00:01:15,241 --> 00:01:16,868
have had to live so miserably

7
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:21,498
for the past 20 years.

8
00:01:40,475 --> 00:01:44,229
Bahn Ha-ni. 37 years old.
She died in a car accident.

9
00:01:44,979 --> 00:01:46,272
But, sir…

10
00:01:46,356 --> 00:01:48,441
Let's have a moment of silence
for the dead.

11
00:01:48,525 --> 00:01:49,609
Rest in peace.

12
00:01:49,692 --> 00:01:53,071
All your organs will become a ray of hope
to those who need them.

13
00:01:53,154 --> 00:01:55,698
Every body part will be used preciously.
Thank you.

14
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:00,036
-What did you want to say?
-Well, I see no liver or gallbladder.

15
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:02,288
What? Wait.

16
00:02:03,081 --> 00:02:04,374
Let me check something.

17
00:02:06,793 --> 00:02:07,794
I knew it.

18
00:02:08,378 --> 00:02:11,548
This is typical among people
who lived overly submissive lives.

19
00:02:11,631 --> 00:02:14,926
They always beg and apologize to others,
so their fingerprints disappear,

20
00:02:15,009 --> 00:02:17,554
and the liver and gallbladder
lose their functions.

21
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,181
She must have lived a really tough life.

22
00:02:20,265 --> 00:02:22,642
Don't get your personal emotions involved.

23
00:02:22,725 --> 00:02:27,397
This is quite common in Korea. But how
many personal emotions do you think exist?

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,899
-Let's find out.
-Let's hit the world record.

25
00:02:30,692 --> 00:02:31,693
Who are you people?

26
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,365
I'm her family.

27
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,659
They say you live long
if you get badmouthed.

28
00:02:40,243 --> 00:02:43,079
I badmouthed her so much,
but she died so early.

29
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,790
My son almost died because of her.

30
00:02:45,874 --> 00:02:48,251
I guess this is what you call karma.

31
00:02:48,334 --> 00:02:52,046
She and I recited the famous poem,
Four Seasons, together.

32
00:02:52,130 --> 00:02:53,464
She was my soul mate.

33
00:02:54,257 --> 00:02:57,343
A bed full of red

34
00:02:58,595 --> 00:02:59,929
And yellow flowers

35
00:03:00,013 --> 00:03:02,265
This used to be her favorite outfit.

36
00:03:02,932 --> 00:03:05,935
We should let her wear it
before we say goodbye to her.

37
00:03:06,853 --> 00:03:10,148
She often used to leave
this malicious comment when she was alive.

38
00:03:10,231 --> 00:03:13,401
I hated this comment.
Please bury it with her.

39
00:03:13,985 --> 00:03:17,196
Here's the money
for the meal you paid for me.

40
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200
And I personally think
you look better in this.

41
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:25,914
Goodbye, Squid Lady, my fellow inmate.

42
00:03:29,292 --> 00:03:30,460
Squid is good

43
00:03:31,085 --> 00:03:32,170
Deliciously good

44
00:03:32,962 --> 00:03:35,089
Nutritious as well

45
00:03:35,173 --> 00:03:36,549
It has ten legs

46
00:03:36,633 --> 00:03:38,134
-A perfect squid
-Get out of here!

47
00:03:38,217 --> 00:03:42,513
-I want you all out of my life!
-Oh, everybody loves it

48
00:03:44,474 --> 00:03:47,268
Squid, squid, squid

49
00:03:47,352 --> 00:03:50,605
Squid, squid, squid

50
00:03:50,688 --> 00:03:55,777
Squid, squid, squid

51
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,740
Squid is good

52
00:04:00,823 --> 00:04:02,492
Deliciously good

53
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:05,245
Nutritious as well

54
00:04:05,328 --> 00:04:06,788
It has ten legs

55
00:04:06,871 --> 00:04:08,373
A perfect squid

56
00:04:09,582 --> 00:04:13,920
Oh, everybody loves it

57
00:04:24,764 --> 00:04:25,890
Are you okay?

58
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,229
Just like always,

59
00:04:31,312 --> 00:04:34,065
I figured I had imagined something weird.

60
00:04:35,525 --> 00:04:36,901
But in that very moment,

61
00:04:37,443 --> 00:04:40,405
something I had never imagined

62
00:04:40,488 --> 00:04:41,906
suddenly started to happen.

63
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:43,783
What's your name?

64
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:44,784
Bahn Ha-ni.

65
00:04:46,744 --> 00:04:48,746
It's Bahn Ha-ni.

66
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,831
Okay.

67
00:04:50,415 --> 00:04:52,208
When is your birthday?

68
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,712
-November 18, 1984.
-November 18, 1984.

69
00:04:55,795 --> 00:04:59,299
Hey, kid. Aren't you too young to be born
in 1984?

70
00:04:59,382 --> 00:05:00,717
I'm 17 years old.

71
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:03,136
Then you weren't born in that year.

72
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,680
Tell me your guardian's name.

73
00:05:05,763 --> 00:05:07,056
Bahn Gi-tae.

74
00:05:08,558 --> 00:05:09,892
What's his number?

75
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,020
It's 018-458-1128.

76
00:05:13,062 --> 00:05:14,772
No one uses "018" these days.

77
00:05:14,856 --> 00:05:18,109
Why not? Mine also starts
with those digits.

78
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:31,080
Are you…

79
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:32,790
You…

80
00:05:34,917 --> 00:05:35,877
You can't be…

81
00:05:36,586 --> 00:05:39,047
Do you know me, ma'am?

82
00:05:41,924 --> 00:05:43,468
BAHN HA-NI

83
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,348
This is crazy.

84
00:06:04,322 --> 00:06:05,782
What's your problem?

85
00:06:06,949 --> 00:06:08,951
Is she mentally insane?

86
00:06:10,244 --> 00:06:12,330
Hey, wake up. Wake up.

87
00:06:12,413 --> 00:06:13,498
It's a dream. Wake up.

88
00:06:13,581 --> 00:06:15,041
Wake up, Ha-ni!

89
00:06:15,124 --> 00:06:17,919
This is a dream! It has to be a dream!

90
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:21,923
Gosh, it hurts.

91
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,466
Why does it hurt?

92
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:26,677
-Ouch!
-My goodness.

93
00:06:28,304 --> 00:06:30,389
What was that for?

94
00:06:30,473 --> 00:06:32,225
What do you think you're doing?

95
00:06:33,059 --> 00:06:35,394
-Did it hurt?
-Obviously!

96
00:06:37,271 --> 00:06:39,398
Nurse, what's wrong with this woman?

97
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,193
Ma'am, please calm down
and lie back in your bed.

98
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:50,785
She has it.

99
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:54,038
She has a heart-shaped mole
just like mine.

100
00:06:57,667 --> 00:06:59,669
She even has hair on it.

101
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:03,756
What are you doing?

102
00:07:05,466 --> 00:07:07,844
What… What are you doing here?

103
00:07:08,845 --> 00:07:13,182
How can my 17-year-old self
be here right now?

104
00:07:13,724 --> 00:07:14,642
Hurry.

105
00:07:18,146 --> 00:07:19,564
Hey!

106
00:07:20,064 --> 00:07:22,692
Hey!

107
00:07:22,775 --> 00:07:25,570
Let go! Let me go! Hey!

108
00:07:28,239 --> 00:07:29,282
What's her deal?

109
00:07:29,866 --> 00:07:31,951
This is unbelievable! This is absurd!

110
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,662
Hey! Who are you?

111
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,123
No, wait.

112
00:07:37,206 --> 00:07:38,541
I'm not crazy.

113
00:07:38,624 --> 00:07:39,625
-I'm fine.
-Attention.

114
00:07:39,709 --> 00:07:41,586
-Wait.
-Will the guardians

115
00:07:41,669 --> 00:07:45,423
of Bahn Ha-ni,
a freshman in Hosu High School,

116
00:07:45,506 --> 00:07:47,008
please come to the ER?

117
00:07:47,091 --> 00:07:49,719
Doctor, do you hear that?

118
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:52,305
Bahn Ha-ni, a freshman

119
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:54,932
in Hosu High School,
is looking for her parents.

120
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:58,394
Don't you get it?
I'm looking for my parents!

121
00:08:00,897 --> 00:08:03,316
Am I imagining things?

122
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,835
Excuse me.

123
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,630
Have you found my parents yet?

124
00:08:25,713 --> 00:08:27,715
Can you wait?
I have to see another patient.

125
00:08:27,798 --> 00:08:29,884
-I'll check a bit later.
-Okay.

126
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:45,149
"100 days to go"?

127
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:48,694
What's happening in 100 days?

128
00:08:54,492 --> 00:08:56,160
My gosh.

129
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,621
I got a huge scar on my arm.

130
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:03,000
It stings.

131
00:09:06,671 --> 00:09:08,005
Hey, kid.

132
00:09:09,090 --> 00:09:10,341
Watch where you're going.

133
00:09:10,424 --> 00:09:11,968
You have eyes too.

134
00:09:12,051 --> 00:09:13,803
You could've stepped aside.

135
00:09:13,886 --> 00:09:15,304
What… What a rude brat.

136
00:09:15,388 --> 00:09:18,558
By the way, do you know
where the payphone is?

137
00:09:18,641 --> 00:09:20,226
I can't seem to find one.

138
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:23,187
Who uses a payphone these days?

139
00:09:23,271 --> 00:09:24,188
What?

140
00:09:28,234 --> 00:09:31,070
Hey, haven't we met somewhere?

141
00:09:32,321 --> 00:09:33,614
I've never seen you before.

142
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:34,865
What?

143
00:09:36,158 --> 00:09:38,411
No, I'm sure we've met.

144
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:53,426
What happened to Hyo-ri?

145
00:09:54,468 --> 00:09:56,637
I HOPE WE WILL NEVER CHANGE

146
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,766
-What about her?
-Why is she so old?

147
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,312
What are you talking about?
She's in her second heyday these days.

148
00:10:04,395 --> 00:10:07,523
And that was shot in Jeju Island
right after she got married--

149
00:10:07,607 --> 00:10:08,774
She's married?

150
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:11,902
Hyo-ri got married?

151
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:17,450
You must not watch TV a lot.

152
00:10:17,533 --> 00:10:19,493
The guy right next to her…

153
00:10:21,579 --> 00:10:24,290
Why am I explaining this to you?

154
00:10:25,082 --> 00:10:26,417
My gosh.

155
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:36,052
BEST MEDICAL FACILITY
FOR HEART SURGERY IN 2020

156
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:41,891
What? 2020?

157
00:10:50,441 --> 00:10:53,277
What… What are you doing here?

158
00:10:53,986 --> 00:10:58,240
How can my 17-year-old self
be here right now?

159
00:11:06,207 --> 00:11:07,208
Hey, lady.

160
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:14,632
Who are you?

161
00:11:15,925 --> 00:11:17,968
I want you to answer me clearly.

162
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:21,305
Do you know me?

163
00:11:27,395 --> 00:11:28,938
Do you know me or not?

164
00:11:33,275 --> 00:11:36,654
I'm sure I've seen that kid somewhere.

165
00:11:37,613 --> 00:11:38,948
Where did I see her?

166
00:11:39,657 --> 00:11:41,033
Excuse me.

167
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:44,328
You still haven't paid for your treatment.

168
00:11:44,912 --> 00:11:47,123
-What?
-You need to pay.

169
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:49,250
Bye then.

170
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:50,334
Okay.

171
00:11:51,627 --> 00:11:54,296
BAHN HA-NI

172
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:03,722
So you're telling me

173
00:12:03,806 --> 00:12:07,143
you're me in 20 years?

174
00:12:08,477 --> 00:12:10,229
I can't believe it either.

175
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:12,481
But I think so.

176
00:12:14,024 --> 00:12:15,526
I can't believe this.

177
00:12:17,486 --> 00:12:19,447
What am I doing in the future?

178
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:22,616
I'm very confused as well.

179
00:12:23,701 --> 00:12:26,162
How did you end up here?

180
00:12:26,245 --> 00:12:27,955
How am I supposed to know?

181
00:12:28,038 --> 00:12:29,331
I woke up, and here I was.

182
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:32,042
Don't you remember anything?

183
00:12:32,626 --> 00:12:34,378
What happened?

184
00:12:39,508 --> 00:12:42,219
I secretly went to an audition
and got caught.

185
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:47,099
I remember my dad chasing after me.

186
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,609
What is it?
Have you figured something out?

187
00:12:56,692 --> 00:12:57,776
What?

188
00:13:00,237 --> 00:13:01,822
No, it's nothing.

189
00:13:06,494 --> 00:13:08,204
Do you know who my best friend is?

190
00:13:08,996 --> 00:13:10,122
Your best friend?

191
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,420
Ji-eun. Don't you know her?

192
00:13:17,296 --> 00:13:21,592
Oh, yes. Oh Ji-eun.
Kids used to call her my minion.

193
00:13:22,968 --> 00:13:24,094
Unbelievable.

194
00:13:26,430 --> 00:13:27,515
Ask me questions too.

195
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:30,935
Ask me something you know.
I mean, something only I would know.

196
00:13:34,647 --> 00:13:35,731
Do you remember

197
00:13:36,315 --> 00:13:39,360
when Yang Chun-sik kissed you
in front of a snack stand?

198
00:13:40,444 --> 00:13:41,487
Do you remember that?

199
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,367
I never even told Ji-eun about that.

200
00:13:46,450 --> 00:13:49,954
Do you also remember what it tasted like

201
00:13:50,037 --> 00:13:51,580
when you kissed him?

202
00:14:01,924 --> 00:14:03,008
-Salad sandwich.
-Salad sandwich.

203
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:08,389
This is so shocking.

204
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:12,643
Seriously? So you really are me?

205
00:14:13,811 --> 00:14:14,687
I mean…

206
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:17,606
This makes no sense at all.

207
00:14:18,899 --> 00:14:20,859
How? How is this possible?

208
00:14:20,943 --> 00:14:22,903
I'm also really confused.

209
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:27,032
I can't believe my 17-year-old self
is right here--

210
00:14:27,116 --> 00:14:28,325
No.

211
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:30,911
That's not what I meant.

212
00:14:32,037 --> 00:14:34,832
How in the world did I, Bahn Ha-ni,

213
00:14:36,834 --> 00:14:39,295
become so ugly?

214
00:14:40,963 --> 00:14:42,923
How badly did you age?

215
00:14:43,007 --> 00:14:45,843
How could this turn into that?

216
00:14:47,970 --> 00:14:48,804
I'm sorry.

217
00:14:50,347 --> 00:14:52,850
Time wasn't very kind to me.

218
00:14:53,851 --> 00:14:55,895
I guess Hyo-ri aged well.

219
00:14:58,105 --> 00:14:59,273
Are these wrinkles?

220
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,401
What are these dark spots?

221
00:15:02,484 --> 00:15:03,569
Is it seaweed?

222
00:15:03,652 --> 00:15:05,070
Stop it.

223
00:15:06,071 --> 00:15:06,947
They're freckles.

224
00:15:18,626 --> 00:15:20,085
Hey, you need to hide.

225
00:15:20,878 --> 00:15:23,130
-My gosh.
-My goodness. Hurry.

226
00:15:23,213 --> 00:15:24,089
My gosh.

227
00:15:26,675 --> 00:15:29,303
Hey, don't you think something's weird?

228
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,221
Gosh.

229
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,900
Bahn Ha-ni isn't a common name.

230
00:15:42,983 --> 00:15:44,526
But two of them came in at the same time.

231
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:45,819
I know, right?

232
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,657
By the way, did you find
the student's parents?

233
00:15:50,449 --> 00:15:52,534
-No, not yet.
-What are we going to do?

234
00:15:53,243 --> 00:15:55,746
She seems a little confused.

235
00:15:55,829 --> 00:15:58,290
Yes, so I called the cops.

236
00:15:58,374 --> 00:16:00,501
They'll come for her soon.

237
00:16:00,584 --> 00:16:01,585
I see.

238
00:16:06,757 --> 00:16:08,342
The number you have dialed…

239
00:16:10,761 --> 00:16:12,179
Do-yun.

240
00:16:14,598 --> 00:16:16,058
The number you have dialed…

241
00:16:17,226 --> 00:16:18,185
Ji-eun.

242
00:16:20,938 --> 00:16:22,648
The number you have dialed…

243
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:26,360
Gosh, why isn't anyone picking up?

244
00:16:32,783 --> 00:16:34,159
What am I going to do?

245
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:37,788
What should I do?

246
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:40,582
What if the cops take me
to a strange place?

247
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:42,876
Will you stop?
I can't think because of you.

248
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:44,503
I'm trying to find a way.

249
00:16:44,586 --> 00:16:46,547
Nothing's going to happen to you.

250
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,758
What if they do
some weird experiments on me?

251
00:16:51,218 --> 00:16:54,638
Who knows? They might take me too.

252
00:17:03,689 --> 00:17:05,941
Are they our test subjects?

253
00:17:06,525 --> 00:17:09,028
Yes, she has the ability to time travel.

254
00:17:10,821 --> 00:17:11,947
Gosh, you punk.

255
00:17:13,741 --> 00:17:15,409
How interesting.

256
00:17:15,492 --> 00:17:16,660
Is she the mother?

257
00:17:19,621 --> 00:17:22,124
They're actually the same person.

258
00:17:22,207 --> 00:17:23,375
Really?

259
00:17:24,793 --> 00:17:26,462
That's quite a change.

260
00:17:26,545 --> 00:17:29,006
She really didn't age well.

261
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:33,719
Oh, right. Peppermint Candy is
in theaters again. What do you say?

262
00:17:33,802 --> 00:17:34,887
The tickets are on me.

263
00:17:34,970 --> 00:17:36,221
Sounds nice.

264
00:17:37,848 --> 00:17:41,351
How fast do you think I can finish
this peppermint candy without chewing it?

265
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,438
-Let's find out.
-Let's hit the world record.

266
00:17:45,272 --> 00:17:46,690
There are speed eating records

267
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,109
for onions, garlic,
chili peppers, and wasabi.

268
00:17:49,193 --> 00:17:50,527
-What's the world record?
-24 seconds.

269
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:54,490
That's impossible.
Let's see how many I can eat instead.

270
00:17:55,908 --> 00:17:57,576
More. You need to eat more.

271
00:17:58,285 --> 00:17:59,912
The best record is 82 candies.

272
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:03,624
That's impossible.

273
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:06,752
Let's finish the experiment.
I want maximum voltage.

274
00:18:06,835 --> 00:18:07,711
What?

275
00:18:08,378 --> 00:18:09,588
Got it.

276
00:18:13,133 --> 00:18:15,135
Increasing voltage.

277
00:18:23,477 --> 00:18:27,397
I want to go back!

278
00:18:31,568 --> 00:18:33,153
What do we do?

279
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:36,281
I don't want to be electrocuted!

280
00:18:36,365 --> 00:18:37,533
Neither do I.

281
00:18:48,669 --> 00:18:50,546
SAVING THE LAST SOLDIER

282
00:18:53,215 --> 00:18:54,383
How many tickets?

283
00:18:57,886 --> 00:18:58,971
How many were sold?

284
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,307
Only 70 thousand.

285
00:19:03,851 --> 00:19:04,685
ANTHONY'S LOSING STREAK AT BOX OFFICE
COULDN'T BE SAVED

286
00:19:04,768 --> 00:19:06,478
Not 700 thousand, but 70 thousand?

287
00:19:08,021 --> 00:19:11,108
That's probably less than
all the sergeants in the military.

288
00:19:11,191 --> 00:19:15,571
Come on, Anthony.
You know how it is with movies.

289
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,447
They can't always be huge hits.

290
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:20,534
I tanked three movies in a row.

291
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:22,077
There must be a conspiracy.

292
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,747
-A conspiracy?
-I blame the haters online.

293
00:19:26,331 --> 00:19:28,125
They're praying for me to fail.

294
00:19:28,917 --> 00:19:30,836
Anthony, it's about time we accepted it.

295
00:19:32,004 --> 00:19:33,547
-Accept what?
-Truth be told,

296
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:37,342
not that many haters have been commenting.
You're just not that popular anymore.

297
00:19:37,885 --> 00:19:40,637
Don't be ridiculous.
A smash TV series or a movie

298
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,306
will instantly restore my fame.

299
00:19:43,515 --> 00:19:45,142
I won't crumble like this.

300
00:19:45,225 --> 00:19:48,395
I, Anthony, will return to his throne.

301
00:19:49,563 --> 00:19:51,315
Right, of course.

302
00:19:51,899 --> 00:19:53,233
You can absolutely do it.

303
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,069
What's going on with
Writer Kim's new TV series?

304
00:19:56,862 --> 00:19:58,280
Well…

305
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,866
Okay, I'll be honest with you.

306
00:20:00,949 --> 00:20:02,993
You're not even being
considered for the role.

307
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,786
You just lack any merit.

308
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:08,624
Jeong-man,

309
00:20:09,208 --> 00:20:12,586
if that's the case,
you should make me desirable again.

310
00:20:13,128 --> 00:20:14,963
Isn't that your job as my agent?

311
00:20:15,714 --> 00:20:18,383
You don't get paid
just to decide what's for lunch.

312
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:19,927
Okay?

313
00:20:21,136 --> 00:20:23,347
You. Call the writer

314
00:20:23,430 --> 00:20:25,057
and say I want to meet in person.

315
00:20:25,140 --> 00:20:26,975
Right. Sure thing.

316
00:20:34,942 --> 00:20:36,151
Damn it!

317
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:40,697
This is what I get for making a star
out of a school bully?

318
00:20:40,781 --> 00:20:43,825
Seriously, someone who knows
about his past should surface

319
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:46,203
and teach him a lesson!

320
00:21:02,469 --> 00:21:03,470
Hey, old lady!

321
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,055
Are you better?

322
00:21:05,138 --> 00:21:08,642
Well… I'm… I'm quite busy, so…

323
00:21:11,395 --> 00:21:12,688
Where are you headed?

324
00:21:13,438 --> 00:21:15,607
It's none of your business,
so leave me alone.

325
00:21:15,691 --> 00:21:17,317
Anyway, who's this?

326
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:21,863
This doesn't concern you,
so please go about your own day.

327
00:21:21,947 --> 00:21:23,490
Leave us be, will you?

328
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:24,783
-Don't.
-Hey!

329
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:28,287
It's that brat from earlier.
Do you know each other?

330
00:21:28,370 --> 00:21:30,038
-Just get lost!
-Just get lost!

331
00:21:35,085 --> 00:21:36,336
Damn it.

332
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:39,840
Old lady, this is rude, you know.

333
00:21:39,923 --> 00:21:43,427
Hey, wait. Just hold on for a second.

334
00:21:44,553 --> 00:21:46,013
Look at this for a second.

335
00:21:48,432 --> 00:21:49,474
-Damn it.
-What…

336
00:21:49,558 --> 00:21:50,809
What the hell?

337
00:21:50,892 --> 00:21:52,394
Seriously?

338
00:21:52,894 --> 00:21:55,147
Stop following me.
Can't you see it's annoying?

339
00:21:55,230 --> 00:21:56,648
I'm annoying you?

340
00:21:57,691 --> 00:21:59,860
Old lady, you see this?

341
00:22:01,194 --> 00:22:04,239
You were about to get hit by a truck
when I saved you

342
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:05,615
by taking you in my arms.

343
00:22:24,551 --> 00:22:27,596
I even dislocated my other shoulder,
and it hurts like hell.

344
00:22:27,679 --> 00:22:29,848
Gosh, I'm so sorry.

345
00:22:29,931 --> 00:22:32,809
-You're sorry? That's all you can say?
-I mean…

346
00:22:34,478 --> 00:22:35,645
Thank you.

347
00:22:36,938 --> 00:22:39,524
There's no need to thank me.
If you're grateful though,

348
00:22:40,484 --> 00:22:42,486
you can pay my hospital bill.

349
00:22:43,987 --> 00:22:46,239
-What?
-I'm not normally one

350
00:22:46,323 --> 00:22:48,700
to take credit for such actions,

351
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:52,662
but I saved your life.

352
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:54,748
What's taking so long?

353
00:22:55,749 --> 00:22:57,375
I don't know what's going on here,

354
00:22:57,459 --> 00:23:00,170
but deal with it quickly
and get back to my crisis.

355
00:23:04,966 --> 00:23:08,929
Okay, I'll take care of
your hospital bill,

356
00:23:09,012 --> 00:23:10,138
if you agree to help…

357
00:23:12,808 --> 00:23:14,142
with her situation.

358
00:23:16,103 --> 00:23:17,604
Where could the kid have gone?

359
00:23:17,687 --> 00:23:20,273
She left her bed
while I was with another patient.

360
00:23:20,357 --> 00:23:23,110
-Let's search again. I'll go this way.
-Sure.

361
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:38,542
Shouldn't I be the one
in the wheelchair though?

362
00:23:39,126 --> 00:23:41,378
Enough talking, more pushing.

363
00:23:42,003 --> 00:23:43,380
You little brat.

364
00:23:46,049 --> 00:23:47,175
Seriously?

365
00:24:12,033 --> 00:24:12,868
Where is the kid?

366
00:24:13,451 --> 00:24:15,120
She said she'll go home and left.

367
00:24:17,247 --> 00:24:19,499
How can you let her run off all alone?

368
00:24:19,583 --> 00:24:21,710
You asked me to
bring her out of the hospital,

369
00:24:21,793 --> 00:24:23,920
not be with her until you got out.

370
00:24:24,004 --> 00:24:25,422
Seriously?

371
00:24:27,007 --> 00:24:29,134
Hold on!

372
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:33,221
While you're at it,

373
00:24:35,056 --> 00:24:37,976
could you lend me 10,000 won
for a cab ride?

374
00:24:41,271 --> 00:24:42,480
I saved your life.

375
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,044
Take the bus if you're broke.

376
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,671
Someone sure spoiled the hell out of you.

377
00:25:08,882 --> 00:25:10,008
What the hell?

378
00:25:10,884 --> 00:25:12,260
I'm a patient, you know.

379
00:25:12,761 --> 00:25:15,347
How can I take a cab with 2,000 won?

380
00:25:24,481 --> 00:25:27,567
Where on earth did our house go?

381
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:31,446
Seriously, what is going on?

382
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:33,907
Mom, Dad,

383
00:25:34,824 --> 00:25:35,951
Grandma…

384
00:25:36,785 --> 00:25:39,204
Where is everybody?

385
00:25:54,261 --> 00:25:56,930
Damn it. Where did she go?

386
00:25:58,723 --> 00:26:01,518
Oh, okay. Let's think.

387
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,521
Where would I have gone?

388
00:26:05,855 --> 00:26:06,856
If it were me…

389
00:26:08,108 --> 00:26:15,073
HOSU HIGH SCHOOL, HOSU MIDDLE SCHOOL

390
00:26:21,538 --> 00:26:22,789
My school…

391
00:26:24,207 --> 00:26:26,042
Why has it changed so much?

392
00:26:31,548 --> 00:26:32,590
It's like I said.

393
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:37,095
So many things have changed.

394
00:26:42,100 --> 00:26:43,393
What do I do now?

395
00:26:44,602 --> 00:26:47,897
Our house is gone,
and my school isn't like it used to be.

396
00:26:50,692 --> 00:26:53,153
Where can I possibly go?

397
00:27:02,537 --> 00:27:03,788
HA-YEONG

398
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,376
-Hey, Ha-yeong.
-Where are you?

399
00:27:09,002 --> 00:27:10,420
Did you sleep out last night?

400
00:27:14,215 --> 00:27:15,759
No, that's not it.

401
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:19,054
Whatever. You know Seong-u is
coming back to Korea today, right?

402
00:27:19,596 --> 00:27:24,184
My gosh, I forgot.
Okay, I'll be right over.

403
00:27:24,267 --> 00:27:25,226
Sure.

404
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,231
HOSU HIGH SCHOOL, HOSU MIDDLE SCHOOL

405
00:27:57,634 --> 00:27:58,468
What's this?

406
00:27:59,719 --> 00:28:02,889
Eating snacks lifts you up
when you're in a bad mood.

407
00:28:03,473 --> 00:28:06,810
I'll try and figure out a way
to get you back to your life.

408
00:28:06,893 --> 00:28:09,396
Really? Will I be able to?

409
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:13,274
You were brought here somehow,
so I'm sure there's a way back.

410
00:28:31,543 --> 00:28:33,586
A fiery energy surrounds you today.

411
00:28:34,421 --> 00:28:37,132
This is the day to make your investment.

412
00:28:40,218 --> 00:28:42,887
By the way, where are we headed?

413
00:28:44,848 --> 00:28:47,642
My gosh! Is this where you live?

414
00:28:49,728 --> 00:28:50,603
Opened.

415
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:53,481
That's so fascinating. I want to try.

416
00:28:56,359 --> 00:28:57,694
Opened.

417
00:28:57,777 --> 00:28:59,070
It worked!

418
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:01,531
No way.

419
00:29:03,408 --> 00:29:05,994
You're me, so it makes sense.

420
00:29:15,920 --> 00:29:17,839
This is incredible!

421
00:29:19,883 --> 00:29:21,509
Wait, what's this?

422
00:29:29,642 --> 00:29:31,895
Check out this pretty scale.

423
00:29:31,978 --> 00:29:35,231
-Let me measure my weight.
-Wait, stop. Don't!

424
00:29:38,026 --> 00:29:39,819
Go and change first.

425
00:29:41,821 --> 00:29:44,240
No way. Is this really where we live?

426
00:29:44,324 --> 00:29:47,410
What about Mom and Dad?
I don't see Grandma either.

427
00:29:47,494 --> 00:29:48,953
Did they all go out?

428
00:29:49,037 --> 00:29:51,247
The grown-ups all live in Daejeon.

429
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:54,793
Daejeon? Wait a second.
That's where Daejeon Expo Park is.

430
00:29:54,876 --> 00:29:57,670
-But why?
-They moved there a while ago.

431
00:30:00,423 --> 00:30:01,841
Anyway, get changed.

432
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:04,636
Unbelievable.

433
00:30:04,719 --> 00:30:07,055
The old me couldn't look shabbier,

434
00:30:07,138 --> 00:30:09,224
but she must be loaded!

435
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:14,539
How is it that I must
tip-toe around my own house?

436
00:31:16,666 --> 00:31:18,877
No one's here, right? Right?

437
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,573
Okay, that's good.

438
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,949
It's all done.

439
00:31:53,536 --> 00:31:54,913
How do I look?

440
00:31:56,497 --> 00:31:57,582
What the hell?

441
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,918
Hey! Are you out of your mind?

442
00:32:00,501 --> 00:32:02,045
What do you think you're doing?

443
00:32:02,128 --> 00:32:04,505
-Take them off.
-They're yours anyway

444
00:32:04,589 --> 00:32:06,049
which means they're also mine.

445
00:32:06,132 --> 00:32:09,135
Must you be so petty
when it comes to sharing?

446
00:32:09,218 --> 00:32:10,637
That's because they're not mine.

447
00:32:12,180 --> 00:32:13,222
Then whose are they?

448
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,767
Your car has arrived.

449
00:32:17,226 --> 00:32:18,686
YOUR CAR HAS ARRIVED

450
00:32:18,770 --> 00:32:19,854
What do I do?

451
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,789
Stay here and don't make a sound.

452
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:39,374
Why must I hide

453
00:32:39,457 --> 00:32:42,210
in this tiny room when this is my house?

454
00:32:43,127 --> 00:32:46,130
This… isn't my house.

455
00:32:47,256 --> 00:32:48,675
Whose is it, then?

456
00:32:48,758 --> 00:32:49,926
Ha-yeong's.

457
00:32:50,510 --> 00:32:51,803
She lets me live with her.

458
00:32:52,387 --> 00:32:53,346
Ha-yeong?

459
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:55,515
Bald Eagle?

460
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:03,773
Ha-yeong.

461
00:33:05,900 --> 00:33:07,902
Chi-su, gosh.

462
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:09,195
Could you…

463
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:13,282
deliver that to your sister Ha-ni?

464
00:33:13,866 --> 00:33:15,535
Thanks in advance.

465
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,135
Again?

466
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:34,887
Leave it with the rest.

467
00:33:34,971 --> 00:33:36,055
BAHN HA-NI

468
00:33:37,807 --> 00:33:39,350
This is from Chae Chi-su.

469
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:42,020
You know him, right?
He's the most handsome guy

470
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:45,606
-and the smartest at our church--
-Like I could give a damn.

471
00:33:57,994 --> 00:33:59,370
Damn it!

472
00:34:03,583 --> 00:34:06,044
Hey, Bald Eagle.
Pulling on your hair like that

473
00:34:06,127 --> 00:34:07,920
only leads to a mess around the house.

474
00:34:10,089 --> 00:34:11,257
It slipped my mind.

475
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,522
Ha-ni, we're home!

476
00:34:26,606 --> 00:34:28,274
Are you telling me

477
00:34:28,357 --> 00:34:30,193
-that you're her housekeeper?
-Auntie!

478
00:34:32,028 --> 00:34:33,154
Where did she go?

479
00:34:33,237 --> 00:34:36,449
I, Bahn Ha-ni,
grow up to be Ha-yeong's maid

480
00:34:36,532 --> 00:34:38,493
in 20 years?

481
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:40,620
Will you please keep it down?

482
00:34:40,703 --> 00:34:42,246
They'll hear you!

483
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:47,376
How did my life get like this?

484
00:34:47,460 --> 00:34:50,004
Why did I grow up to be a loser?

485
00:34:50,088 --> 00:34:51,464
Keep it down!

486
00:34:58,346 --> 00:35:00,223
-What was that noise?
-What do you mean?

487
00:35:00,306 --> 00:35:02,100
Did you bring a guest without asking?

488
00:35:02,183 --> 00:35:04,143
You must've heard what came from my phone.

489
00:35:04,227 --> 00:35:05,770
I was watching something, you see.

490
00:35:05,853 --> 00:35:07,271
It didn't sound that way.

491
00:35:07,355 --> 00:35:08,856
But it was.

492
00:35:14,320 --> 00:35:17,323
Mom, Dad's on the phone!

493
00:35:17,406 --> 00:35:19,158
Sure thing. I'm coming.

494
00:35:20,493 --> 00:35:22,286
Seong-u's hungry, so set the table.

495
00:35:29,627 --> 00:35:32,338
Please. Just please stay quietly in here.

496
00:35:32,421 --> 00:35:34,382
I'm begging you.

497
00:35:35,758 --> 00:35:38,219
-Here you go. Dig in.
-Thanks.

498
00:35:38,761 --> 00:35:41,889
My goodness.
It looks like you lost some weight.

499
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:45,643
-Studying in college is tough, right?
-Not really.

500
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:49,021
I'm finally able to study at my own level.
It's been a blast.

501
00:35:50,189 --> 00:35:52,024
Goodness, my son.

502
00:35:53,025 --> 00:35:55,319
I always wonder
who you got your smarts from.

503
00:35:56,112 --> 00:35:58,865
You got into an Ivy League school
at the age of 17.

504
00:35:58,948 --> 00:36:01,075
Based on the evolution theory,

505
00:36:01,159 --> 00:36:03,703
I probably got equal amounts
from both you and Dad.

506
00:36:03,786 --> 00:36:06,330
Seong-u, are you seeing anyone?

507
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:08,541
That's what college students do.

508
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:12,336
Hey. How dare you compare him
with those average students?

509
00:36:13,504 --> 00:36:14,839
I'm not interested in dating.

510
00:36:15,339 --> 00:36:17,258
I don't even have enough time

511
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:21,345
to research all the secrets
of the universe.

512
00:36:23,055 --> 00:36:24,849
Right. That's true.

513
00:36:25,433 --> 00:36:26,726
I'll cook some more meat.

514
00:36:29,312 --> 00:36:31,314
Seong-u, you're making me teary-eyed.

515
00:36:39,989 --> 00:36:40,948
Eat up.

516
00:36:41,449 --> 00:36:43,409
Did you crave Korean food?

517
00:36:45,244 --> 00:36:46,370
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

518
00:36:46,454 --> 00:36:48,623
I SERIOUSLY NEED TO PEE

519
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,208
HAVE YOU GONE INSANE?

520
00:36:50,291 --> 00:36:52,877
HOLD IT IN!

521
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:56,422
I CAN'T HOLD IT IN ANYMORE

522
00:36:56,505 --> 00:36:58,299
PEE YOUR PANTS A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME

523
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:01,135
You've grown a lot of hair.

524
00:37:06,849 --> 00:37:09,352
What are you doing? Cook more meat.

525
00:37:10,436 --> 00:37:12,980
What? I'm warming up my wrist

526
00:37:13,689 --> 00:37:15,691
so that I can cook better.

527
00:37:16,484 --> 00:37:17,693
You won't be disappointed.

528
00:37:31,999 --> 00:37:33,167
I almost peed my pants.

529
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:41,425
What is this?

530
00:37:49,058 --> 00:37:49,934
What is that?

531
00:37:50,017 --> 00:37:52,478
I think it's coming from the bathroom.

532
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,231
I'll… I'll check.

533
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,233
Forget it. Focus on the meat.

534
00:37:58,609 --> 00:37:59,819
Okay.

535
00:38:18,838 --> 00:38:20,506
A fiery energy surrounds you today.

536
00:38:21,173 --> 00:38:22,133
Fire.

537
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:41,319
-Fire!
-Fire!

538
00:38:45,781 --> 00:38:46,907
Seong-u! Goodness!

539
00:38:50,786 --> 00:38:52,788
Bahn Ha-ni!

540
00:39:03,424 --> 00:39:04,675
Good.

541
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,694
What? I still had this?

542
00:39:26,447 --> 00:39:28,240
When did you come here, you rat?

543
00:39:28,991 --> 00:39:30,868
Why are you already back?

544
00:39:32,036 --> 00:39:33,287
I'm the chairman.

545
00:39:34,080 --> 00:39:36,916
What's it to you what time I come home?

546
00:39:38,459 --> 00:39:39,877
I should've booked it.

547
00:39:49,720 --> 00:39:50,679
What is this?

548
00:39:56,268 --> 00:39:58,729
-Receipts.
-Of what?

549
00:39:58,813 --> 00:40:02,733
The money you spent on your hobbies
and all sorts of licenses.

550
00:40:02,817 --> 00:40:04,735
Credit card transactions and bills.

551
00:40:04,819 --> 00:40:06,153
Why did you keep them?

552
00:40:06,237 --> 00:40:07,947
So that you'll pay me back.

553
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:11,575
Why the hell are you doing this to me?

554
00:40:11,659 --> 00:40:13,160
Are you ill or something?

555
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:16,705
I'm right. You have male menopause.

556
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,458
Raspberry wine is the best for that.

557
00:40:19,542 --> 00:40:20,709
Should I buy some?

558
00:40:21,335 --> 00:40:24,088
You punk. You just don't get it, do you?

559
00:40:24,755 --> 00:40:26,757
Then what do you want me to do?

560
00:40:26,841 --> 00:40:28,008
Let's cut to the chase.

561
00:40:28,092 --> 00:40:31,846
You failed to keep your promise,
so get out of my house.

562
00:40:32,680 --> 00:40:34,390
Don't you dare set foot in here again

563
00:40:34,473 --> 00:40:36,308
until you pay me back!

564
00:40:37,935 --> 00:40:40,312
Fine. How much is the total?

565
00:40:41,939 --> 00:40:44,150
1,820,180,000 won.

566
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:48,154
I'll do you a favor and leave out
the 180,000 won.

567
00:40:50,156 --> 00:40:51,699
How… How much again?

568
00:40:51,782 --> 00:40:54,160
What is it? Do you need me to repeat it?

569
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:56,996
It's 1.82 billion won, you bastard!

570
00:41:01,125 --> 00:41:02,376
Damn it.

571
00:41:04,086 --> 00:41:07,006
You're such a cheapskate.
Fine, I'll pay you back!

572
00:41:08,799 --> 00:41:12,052
Damn it. It's 1.82 billion won.

573
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:17,141
Damn it. Omitting 180,000 won, right?

574
00:41:18,267 --> 00:41:19,518
That little bastard.

575
00:41:20,019 --> 00:41:23,689
By the way, everything in that suitcase

576
00:41:23,772 --> 00:41:24,940
was bought with my money.

577
00:41:25,608 --> 00:41:27,193
Leave them all behind.

578
00:41:27,276 --> 00:41:29,945
You're wrong.
My ex-girlfriends bought them for me.

579
00:41:30,029 --> 00:41:31,739
-You wish.
-Ex-girlfriends?

580
00:41:31,822 --> 00:41:33,949
Come here, you bastard!

581
00:41:37,578 --> 00:41:39,038
You must've been worried sick.

582
00:41:39,538 --> 00:41:40,831
The fire was put out early,

583
00:41:40,915 --> 00:41:43,167
so not much was burned.

584
00:41:43,250 --> 00:41:44,710
Okay, then. Goodbye.

585
00:41:44,793 --> 00:41:45,878
-Goodbye.
-Thank you.

586
00:41:50,925 --> 00:41:52,301
What's with you?

587
00:41:52,384 --> 00:41:54,512
You're acting so out of character.

588
00:41:55,221 --> 00:41:56,514
I'm sorry.

589
00:41:59,225 --> 00:42:01,602
We'll be at a hotel
until everything gets sorted out.

590
00:42:01,685 --> 00:42:04,688
You can go back to Daejeon
or sleep outside. I don't care.

591
00:42:05,397 --> 00:42:06,649
Okay.

592
00:42:09,109 --> 00:42:13,197
What did I do so wrong in my past life
to have you as my sister?

593
00:42:14,073 --> 00:42:15,199
Let's go.

594
00:42:27,586 --> 00:42:29,296
You must have been startled.

595
00:42:29,380 --> 00:42:31,173
It wasn't my fault this happened.

596
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:43,435
Goodness. You should've been more careful.

597
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:45,354
This was all because of you.

598
00:42:45,938 --> 00:42:48,315
I told you to keep it down.

599
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:51,902
I didn't expect it to shoot water
up my butt.

600
00:42:51,986 --> 00:42:53,529
What would you know?

601
00:42:53,612 --> 00:42:55,823
You only wipe your butt with toilet paper.

602
00:43:00,452 --> 00:43:01,870
Where will we be staying?

603
00:43:05,583 --> 00:43:06,750
I'm tired.

604
00:43:17,344 --> 00:43:18,637
I feel so refreshed.

605
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:23,017
Aren't you washing up?

606
00:43:23,100 --> 00:43:25,894
I can't be bothered. I'll do it tomorrow.

607
00:43:25,978 --> 00:43:27,479
Gosh, so disgusting.

608
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,024
And what's with these frumpy pants?

609
00:43:31,150 --> 00:43:33,527
Your legs get chilly as you age.

610
00:43:41,577 --> 00:43:42,661
I'm hungry.

611
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:49,335
Here.

612
00:43:54,006 --> 00:43:56,967
I don't want this. I want their mom.

613
00:43:58,093 --> 00:44:00,679
It's expensive. It's about 20,000 won.

614
00:44:00,763 --> 00:44:03,849
What? A fried chicken costs that much?

615
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:07,394
Gimbap worth 5,000 won
and 15,000 won tteokbokki are common.

616
00:44:08,896 --> 00:44:11,231
It must be difficult to live in 2020.

617
00:44:11,815 --> 00:44:13,150
You're too young to know this,

618
00:44:13,233 --> 00:44:16,028
but making a living
is the most difficult thing to do in life.

619
00:44:17,446 --> 00:44:19,448
But still, you're 37 years old.

620
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,241
You have no money to order chicken?

621
00:44:23,619 --> 00:44:24,620
Money?

622
00:44:27,414 --> 00:44:28,290
Right.

623
00:44:34,505 --> 00:44:37,758
Hey, I'm waiting for you. Where are you?

624
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:42,721
What?

625
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,227
Hello?

626
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:51,438
Hey. Why haven't you wired me
the money yet?

627
00:44:51,522 --> 00:44:52,648
Who is this?

628
00:44:53,816 --> 00:44:57,319
I covered your hospital bills
since you got hurt because of me.

629
00:44:57,820 --> 00:44:59,947
But you should pay me back
for everything else.

630
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,824
Oh, it's you, old lady.

631
00:45:02,658 --> 00:45:04,993
So… Where are you right now?

632
00:45:10,457 --> 00:45:12,292
MEN'S BATH

633
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:22,928
Where's the money?

634
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:26,140
Let's go inside and talk.

635
00:45:27,474 --> 00:45:28,517
Could you pay for this?

636
00:45:31,895 --> 00:45:35,149
Do you still not have any money?

637
00:45:36,316 --> 00:45:39,862
Since I already owe you,
please lend me 10,000 won more.

638
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:43,824
I saved your life.

639
00:45:46,034 --> 00:45:47,786
Why does it still hurt?

640
00:45:51,999 --> 00:45:54,084
I'm parched. Can I drink some sikhye?

641
00:45:54,168 --> 00:45:55,335
Just drink water!

642
00:45:56,253 --> 00:45:58,338
Why are you shouting at me?

643
00:45:58,422 --> 00:45:59,339
You found her.

644
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,800
What? Why are you here?

645
00:46:01,884 --> 00:46:03,135
What's it to you?

646
00:46:03,218 --> 00:46:05,179
What do you mean?

647
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:07,639
I'm asking you why you're here.

648
00:46:07,723 --> 00:46:10,142
Is it broken? What's going on?

649
00:46:16,398 --> 00:46:20,360
It would be perfect
if we also had a fried chicken.

650
00:46:21,361 --> 00:46:24,072
This 37-year-old doesn't even have
any money.

651
00:46:24,656 --> 00:46:26,241
Old lady, you must be really poor.

652
00:46:28,285 --> 00:46:31,955
You're one to talk when I paid
for your entrance fee and the eggs.

653
00:46:32,498 --> 00:46:34,208
Let me repeat myself.

654
00:46:34,833 --> 00:46:39,379
Make sure you pay me back my 1,410,000 won
by the end of this week.

655
00:46:39,463 --> 00:46:42,549
I got it. I never go back on my words.

656
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:44,301
Why did you eat two of them?

657
00:46:44,384 --> 00:46:46,595
Finders keepers.

658
00:46:47,221 --> 00:46:48,805
She has no manners.

659
00:46:49,681 --> 00:46:51,058
Old lady.

660
00:46:52,476 --> 00:46:54,019
You don't look like sisters.

661
00:46:54,811 --> 00:46:55,771
Are you her mom?

662
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,106
Mind your own business.

663
00:47:11,787 --> 00:47:13,497
Doctor Park has become a snob.

664
00:47:13,580 --> 00:47:16,250
He was a doctor who once
circumcised boys in Yongdu-dong

665
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:18,710
until I had brought him over to Apgujeong.

666
00:47:20,254 --> 00:47:23,757
How dare you blackmail me
with my before surgery photos?

667
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,759
What's wrong?

668
00:47:26,593 --> 00:47:28,637
He won't give me fillers for free anymore.

669
00:47:29,304 --> 00:47:30,597
Fillers?

670
00:47:30,681 --> 00:47:33,392
CHANG PLASTIC SURGERY CLINIC

671
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:43,110
Damn it.

672
00:47:48,782 --> 00:47:51,660
-What's wrong?
-The doctor refused to give free fillers.

673
00:47:51,743 --> 00:47:54,288
-Fillers too?
-Be quiet.

674
00:47:57,082 --> 00:48:01,420
Hey, let's just stop visiting
these clinics now.

675
00:48:01,503 --> 00:48:03,922
-It's an addiction.
-Don't be absurd.

676
00:48:04,006 --> 00:48:06,258
What will you do about these laugh lines?

677
00:48:06,341 --> 00:48:08,885
I should get rid of them
before meeting with Writer Kim.

678
00:48:08,969 --> 00:48:11,888
You should accept the fact
that you're getting older now.

679
00:48:11,972 --> 00:48:16,393
And there are more injection holes
than pores on your face.

680
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,104
There you go again.

681
00:48:20,105 --> 00:48:22,190
-Are you asking for a fight?
-No. I understand.

682
00:48:22,274 --> 00:48:24,610
I'll look for another clinic.

683
00:48:24,693 --> 00:48:27,613
He's right. Our handsome Anthony
shouldn't have

684
00:48:28,697 --> 00:48:30,490
-laugh lines.
-Right.

685
00:48:32,117 --> 00:48:33,619
Do everything you can

686
00:48:34,369 --> 00:48:36,622
to get all of my photos from Dr. Park.

687
00:48:37,873 --> 00:48:38,874
-What photos?
-Damn it!

688
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:40,125
He startled me.

689
00:48:40,208 --> 00:48:43,045
Photos of me before the surgery.
Before surgery photos.

690
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,381
FRIENDS FOREVER

691
00:48:53,096 --> 00:48:54,181
Get up.

692
00:48:55,307 --> 00:48:57,517
-Hey, get up.
-Why?

693
00:48:58,268 --> 00:48:59,686
I want to sleep in.

694
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:01,563
It's Monday. I have to go to work.

695
00:49:01,647 --> 00:49:03,023
Get up.

696
00:49:03,815 --> 00:49:05,359
I'll see you later then.

697
00:49:06,151 --> 00:49:08,236
It's warm and cozy here.

698
00:49:08,320 --> 00:49:09,905
Will you please listen to me?

699
00:49:09,988 --> 00:49:12,115
I already want to leave you here as is.

700
00:49:12,199 --> 00:49:15,577
Gosh. You know I'm not a morning person.

701
00:49:17,245 --> 00:49:19,498
We can talk again once you grow up.

702
00:49:19,581 --> 00:49:22,417
I will never turn out like you, old lady.

703
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:24,961
I get it.

704
00:49:26,213 --> 00:49:27,339
So,

705
00:49:28,340 --> 00:49:29,883
could you not call me that?

706
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:32,886
What should I call you then?

707
00:49:34,054 --> 00:49:36,431
I can't consider you my sister.

708
00:49:39,559 --> 00:49:40,852
Let's talk about it later.

709
00:49:44,940 --> 00:49:45,941
Darn it.

710
00:50:04,710 --> 00:50:06,545
Count the boxes properly.

711
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:09,548
-Be accurate.
-I'm fired?

712
00:50:10,507 --> 00:50:13,719
The headquarters made that decision.

713
00:50:13,802 --> 00:50:15,095
What can I do?

714
00:50:15,679 --> 00:50:19,850
But it wasn't my fault.
It's not right for me to get fired.

715
00:50:21,268 --> 00:50:22,352
You're right.

716
00:50:22,436 --> 00:50:25,772
I'll go back there and talk to them.

717
00:50:26,565 --> 00:50:29,317
"I was incompetent. Fire me instead."

718
00:50:29,401 --> 00:50:30,610
Darn it.

719
00:50:31,820 --> 00:50:33,780
What is it, honey?

720
00:50:33,864 --> 00:50:36,658
The landowner wants to raise the rent?

721
00:50:36,742 --> 00:50:37,868
By 100 million?

722
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:43,582
Pack up this instant.

723
00:50:44,124 --> 00:50:45,625
Isn't it obvious?

724
00:50:46,334 --> 00:50:50,130
I'll get fired from work,
and we'll become dirt poor.

725
00:50:50,672 --> 00:50:52,466
Send our oldest kid to my mom's

726
00:50:53,633 --> 00:50:55,135
and our second to your mom's.

727
00:50:55,635 --> 00:50:59,097
You and I can sleep on the streets
or something.

728
00:50:59,181 --> 00:51:03,185
You can keep the house.

729
00:51:03,977 --> 00:51:07,189
I'll try to fix this myself.

730
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:09,232
Really?

731
00:51:14,154 --> 00:51:17,282
We're recalling all Squid-good products.

732
00:51:17,365 --> 00:51:19,659
Ms. Oh is looking
into the manufacturing process

733
00:51:19,743 --> 00:51:22,162
and the product itself.

734
00:51:22,245 --> 00:51:24,539
How could you let
something like this happen

735
00:51:24,623 --> 00:51:27,000
as soon as we released our new product?

736
00:51:28,627 --> 00:51:29,628
I'm sorry.

737
00:51:30,128 --> 00:51:33,298
But we were able to respond quickly enough

738
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,967
and calm down the negative opinions
that had become viral.

739
00:51:36,551 --> 00:51:38,845
We just need to negotiate with the victim…

740
00:51:39,846 --> 00:51:43,350
We should hold off the compensation
for now.

741
00:51:49,189 --> 00:51:51,399
This is the analysis report on Squid-good.

742
00:51:53,276 --> 00:51:57,030
So there's nothing wrong
with the product itself?

743
00:51:57,739 --> 00:52:01,368
No, sir. We retrieved the product
and requested a thorough analysis.

744
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:04,079
They couldn't find anything wrong with it.

745
00:52:04,162 --> 00:52:07,082
If that's the case,

746
00:52:07,165 --> 00:52:08,834
why did that happen to that boy?

747
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,462
He may have had a condition,

748
00:52:12,546 --> 00:52:14,506
or it could've been intentional.

749
00:52:15,090 --> 00:52:16,591
The boy's mother

750
00:52:16,675 --> 00:52:20,595
was the one who demanded
a hefty sum of compensation first.

751
00:52:20,679 --> 00:52:24,182
Okay, but there's no way to prove that?

752
00:52:24,266 --> 00:52:25,475
No, sir.

753
00:52:26,101 --> 00:52:30,021
So I'm planning to meet with her myself.

754
00:52:30,939 --> 00:52:32,482
All right.

755
00:52:32,566 --> 00:52:36,361
Then I'll leave this issue to you
and trust that you'll solve it.

756
00:52:38,780 --> 00:52:39,823
Yes, sir.

757
00:52:54,462 --> 00:52:55,714
You're always like this.

758
00:52:57,465 --> 00:52:59,134
-Sorry?
-You're always striving

759
00:53:01,469 --> 00:53:03,722
to outdo your husband.

760
00:53:09,019 --> 00:53:10,395
I'm sorry, Mother.

761
00:53:12,522 --> 00:53:14,733
That wasn't my intention.

762
00:53:14,816 --> 00:53:16,735
I wonder

763
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:19,821
if you're just slow-witted
or as sly as a fox.

764
00:53:37,797 --> 00:53:40,008
Why are we here?
Are you visiting a patient?

765
00:53:41,343 --> 00:53:44,554
I need to do something.

766
00:53:44,638 --> 00:53:46,097
Wait here.

767
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,975
I don't want to. I'll be bored.

768
00:53:54,689 --> 00:53:58,652
Buy your favorite snack with my card.

769
00:53:59,611 --> 00:54:00,654
Just one.

770
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:13,124
Get out of here!

771
00:54:13,208 --> 00:54:14,918
-Gosh!
-Please.

772
00:54:15,001 --> 00:54:18,088
-What's with you?
-Could you forgive me this once?

773
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:22,592
Instead of the compensation fee,
you brought some measly fruits,

774
00:54:22,676 --> 00:54:25,303
-and you want me to forgive you?
-I'm truly sorry.

775
00:54:25,387 --> 00:54:28,431
But I didn't force him to eat the snack.

776
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:31,601
This is unbelievable.
Are you saying that I'm deceiving you?

777
00:54:31,685 --> 00:54:34,270
-No, ma'am. That's not it.
-Whatever.

778
00:54:34,354 --> 00:54:37,148
I have no business with you,
so just leave.

779
00:54:37,232 --> 00:54:39,609
Ma'am. Please.

780
00:54:39,693 --> 00:54:42,487
Just this once.
Please forgive me this once.

781
00:54:42,570 --> 00:54:45,949
That's such a cheap fruit basket.

782
00:54:51,454 --> 00:54:52,580
What should I do?

783
00:55:24,112 --> 00:55:25,113
What was that?

784
00:55:28,408 --> 00:55:29,659
OH JI-EUN

785
00:55:31,244 --> 00:55:34,039
I'm Oh Ji-eun,
the team leader of Joa Confectionery's

786
00:55:34,122 --> 00:55:35,415
Product Development Team.

787
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:39,502
I came to discuss the compensation fee.

788
00:55:40,962 --> 00:55:44,591
So how much are you thinking?

789
00:55:45,550 --> 00:55:49,763
Since the headquarters sent you,
it must be a good amount.

790
00:55:51,765 --> 00:55:53,475
This is so funny.

791
00:55:56,394 --> 00:55:58,146
I heard it was critical.

792
00:55:59,105 --> 00:56:02,233
But he seems to be doing better
than I thought.

793
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:05,820
He is not.

794
00:56:05,904 --> 00:56:09,491
He almost died
because of that Squid-good snack.

795
00:56:10,742 --> 00:56:12,160
He needs to rest.

796
00:56:12,243 --> 00:56:14,871
-Let's talk in the lounge.
-Okay.

797
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:02,627
Do you want some?

798
00:57:05,380 --> 00:57:06,673
CHOCO CHIP

799
00:57:14,389 --> 00:57:15,348
CHOCO CHIP

800
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,568
Hey.

801
00:57:27,694 --> 00:57:29,028
Hey, what's wrong?

802
00:57:37,036 --> 00:57:38,621
These were expensive.

803
00:57:39,706 --> 00:57:40,790
Mom!

804
00:57:42,167 --> 00:57:43,710
Mom!

805
00:57:46,171 --> 00:57:47,213
Mom…

806
00:57:48,256 --> 00:57:50,717
-Oh, no. What's wrong with him?
-Goodness.

807
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,093
Call the doctor.

808
00:57:52,594 --> 00:57:54,262
Oh, dear.

809
00:57:54,345 --> 00:57:56,431
-Goodness.
-What should we do?

810
00:57:56,514 --> 00:57:58,475
What's going on? What happened to him?

811
00:57:59,225 --> 00:58:00,727
I don't know.

812
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:03,480
He was just eating some snacks
and then this happened.

813
00:58:04,439 --> 00:58:07,734
Hey. Hey, wake up.

814
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:09,736
-Please call a doctor.
-Hey.

815
00:58:09,819 --> 00:58:12,322
My son! What's wrong with you?

816
00:58:12,405 --> 00:58:14,782
What happened to you?

817
00:58:15,283 --> 00:58:18,828
Are you okay? Try to breathe.

818
00:58:18,912 --> 00:58:20,622
Breathe. It's okay. Mom's here.

819
00:58:20,705 --> 00:58:22,081
-Oh, no.
-This is…

820
00:58:23,708 --> 00:58:26,544
-This is from Geoseong Confectionery.
-What?

821
00:58:27,253 --> 00:58:28,630
Did you eat this?

822
00:58:28,713 --> 00:58:30,715
Who fed this to my son? Who?

823
00:58:31,216 --> 00:58:33,092
Was it you? Did you give this to him?

824
00:58:36,304 --> 00:58:38,014
That's… That's not what happened.

825
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,600
It wasn't intentional.

826
00:58:46,189 --> 00:58:48,358
Bahn… Bahn Ha-ni?

827
00:58:49,817 --> 00:58:51,611
-Over here!
-Please move aside.

828
00:58:57,575 --> 00:58:59,661
-Call his doctor and check his vitals.
-Okay.

829
00:59:00,328 --> 00:59:02,205
-He'll be okay.
-Okay.

830
00:59:03,039 --> 00:59:05,250
Will he be okay?

831
00:59:05,333 --> 00:59:07,085
What should I do?

832
00:59:07,168 --> 00:59:08,670
-He'll be fine.
-Okay.

833
00:59:09,295 --> 00:59:10,838
-It's okay.
-It's okay. Mom's here.

834
00:59:14,175 --> 00:59:15,969
Let me go!

835
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,514
-That hurts!
-Who the hell are you?

836
00:59:19,597 --> 00:59:20,640
What are you?

837
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:25,144
I told you to just wait for me.

838
00:59:25,687 --> 00:59:28,856
Why did you barge into my life
and cause a mess?

839
00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,985
A mess? In your life?

840
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,319
Don't make me laugh.

841
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,406
You've been living
this crappy life all along!

842
00:59:38,533 --> 00:59:39,617
What?

843
00:59:40,994 --> 00:59:42,036
Crappy?

844
00:59:42,120 --> 00:59:46,249
I saw you getting down
on your knees and begging!

845
00:59:48,001 --> 00:59:50,336
You have no house, money, or pride.

846
00:59:51,629 --> 00:59:54,424
How dare you give me
such a miserable and humiliating future?

847
00:59:55,133 --> 00:59:58,219
What kind of a life did you live
to become so pathetic?

848
01:00:00,221 --> 01:00:01,264
You're right.

849
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:06,019
To be honest, I had no idea
I'd turn out this way.

850
01:00:08,146 --> 01:00:09,272
Had I not

851
01:00:10,648 --> 01:00:12,650
been so reckless 20 years ago…

852
01:00:13,901 --> 01:00:16,613
-Had nothing happened that day…
-Ha-ni, watch out!

853
01:00:28,166 --> 01:00:29,208
However,

854
01:00:30,460 --> 01:00:32,587
that was one thing
I didn't want you to know.

855
01:00:35,006 --> 01:00:37,675
Because I knew very well how you'd feel

856
01:00:39,177 --> 01:00:40,845
once you found out.

857
01:00:45,642 --> 01:00:46,684
Ha-ni!

858
01:01:04,369 --> 01:01:07,372
BAHN GI-TAE

859
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:15,773
I'm not even married.

860
01:02:15,857 --> 01:02:17,942
I don't have a boyfriend.
I was probably fired.

861
01:02:18,025 --> 01:02:21,237
-My sister kicked me out.
-There's no way I let this happen!

862
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:22,572
This can't be my future.

863
01:02:22,655 --> 01:02:24,866
By the way, what's your name?

864
01:02:24,949 --> 01:02:27,118
I'm Superman who saved you
from those villains.

865
01:02:27,201 --> 01:02:28,244
Superman?

866
01:02:28,953 --> 01:02:32,331
Someone rich wouldn't sell these.
Maybe it's a gigolo who's now broke?

867
01:02:32,415 --> 01:02:35,585
If we're lucky, we might find a way
to send you back in time.

868
01:02:35,668 --> 01:02:38,129
You're two different individuals
with the same fortune.

869
01:02:38,212 --> 01:02:41,883
If you're not a ghost, it means
you're both the same person.

870
