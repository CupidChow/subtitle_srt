1
00:00:52,761 --> 00:00:54,512
FINALE

2
00:01:07,233 --> 00:01:08,318
What is it?

3
00:01:09,694 --> 00:01:13,406
This was your dad?

4
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:14,324
Yes.

5
00:01:14,908 --> 00:01:16,326
That's my dad.

6
00:01:16,951 --> 00:01:17,786
This is him.

7
00:01:17,869 --> 00:01:19,579
The person who took me to my dad

8
00:01:21,122 --> 00:01:22,665
at my mom's funeral.

9
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:24,501
Really?

10
00:01:25,418 --> 00:01:27,045
So you met my dad?

11
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,101
Mom…

12
00:01:50,777 --> 00:01:52,529
BAHN GI-TAE

13
00:01:53,822 --> 00:01:55,281
Why are you crying, young man?

14
00:01:56,407 --> 00:01:57,534
My mom…

15
00:01:59,953 --> 00:02:02,664
She passed away.

16
00:02:03,373 --> 00:02:05,250
I see.

17
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:10,255
You must have been too scared to go in.

18
00:02:16,719 --> 00:02:17,846
Did you know this?

19
00:02:19,055 --> 00:02:22,642
Eating this snack when you're down
lifts up your mood instantly.

20
00:02:28,773 --> 00:02:30,984
And this lily of the valley

21
00:02:31,526 --> 00:02:34,362
is a gift I'm giving you.

22
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,500
Come on.

23
00:02:47,584 --> 00:02:51,337
I'll take you where your family is.

24
00:02:52,297 --> 00:02:53,798
Thanks to the snack he gave me,

25
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,510
I was able to find comfort by sharing it

26
00:02:58,845 --> 00:02:59,971
with my dad.

27
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:02,515
How fascinating.

28
00:03:03,349 --> 00:03:05,059
Our fates must be entwined.

29
00:03:05,143 --> 00:03:08,187
We met as kids and you also met my dad.

30
00:03:13,109 --> 00:03:15,153
It must be thanks to him

31
00:03:16,029 --> 00:03:17,488
that you've turned out so great.

32
00:03:18,072 --> 00:03:19,032
Thanks…

33
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:23,244
for having a good memory of my father.

34
00:03:28,833 --> 00:03:31,586
Is this what he meant?

35
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:34,923
-What do you mean?
-You see,

36
00:03:35,632 --> 00:03:39,385
I went to see Jobs again
because I was frustrated.

37
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:41,679
Anyway, he said to me

38
00:03:41,763 --> 00:03:44,140
that I can't understand
what I'm being told

39
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:47,018
and that I can't remember what I saw.

40
00:03:47,602 --> 00:03:50,230
-What does that mean?
-I have no idea.

41
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:52,357
What I'm sure of is

42
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,027
that it has to do with you
getting back to your timeline.

43
00:04:07,664 --> 00:04:08,581
I'm sorry.

44
00:04:11,751 --> 00:04:14,462
-About what?
-When I first got here,

45
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,425
I accused you of leading a pathetic life.

46
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:20,843
Well,

47
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:23,846
it was true at the time.

48
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:26,683
It wasn't.

49
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:31,229
The reason why we received
all this help so far…

50
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:36,526
is because you're a good person.

51
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:40,947
It's all thanks to you.

52
00:04:41,948 --> 00:04:43,366
It's because you came here.

53
00:04:44,534 --> 00:04:48,162
I finally get it now.

54
00:04:49,664 --> 00:04:51,749
I now know why your life

55
00:04:51,833 --> 00:04:55,837
has been so difficult and painful.

56
00:05:03,553 --> 00:05:04,595
I'm sure…

57
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:08,850
you'll be able to get over this too.

58
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,729
Because…

59
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:15,940
you're me.

60
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:27,535
What are you taking photos of?

61
00:05:28,119 --> 00:05:29,370
Isn't this a wildflower?

62
00:05:29,454 --> 00:05:31,581
No, it's only a weed.

63
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:33,416
Seriously?

64
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:35,668
Where on earth are the flowers then?

65
00:05:35,752 --> 00:05:39,422
I told you that the weather is
still too cold for flowers to bloom.

66
00:05:39,505 --> 00:05:42,508
But this is my first time
taking photos outside.

67
00:05:42,592 --> 00:05:45,678
I'm sure there are flowers
waiting for me somewhere.

68
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:50,099
Don't go too far though.

69
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:05,281
It's a flower.

70
00:06:13,372 --> 00:06:14,373
Where did it go?

71
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,668
Ha-ni.

72
00:06:19,420 --> 00:06:20,963
Ha-ni.

73
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:24,801
Ha-ni!

74
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,095
Anthony, I'll only ask this once more.

75
00:07:09,178 --> 00:07:10,888
Are you sure you won't regret it?

76
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:12,473
What can I regret

77
00:07:13,099 --> 00:07:14,934
when I just began to repent?

78
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,937
Still, it's hard-earned money.

79
00:07:18,020 --> 00:07:21,441
That was earned by Anthony.
Besides, I'm still young.

80
00:07:21,524 --> 00:07:24,360
I can work hard again, so don't worry.

81
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:28,364
But it's your life savings.
Why not donate only half…

82
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:31,325
-or two-thirds--
-It's a done deal.

83
00:07:32,034 --> 00:07:34,412
I already agreed to donate
all my life savings

84
00:07:34,495 --> 00:07:37,081
and that it should be used
to help the recovery

85
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,543
of all the victims of school bullying,
so let's leave it at that.

86
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:44,213
I see. So you already signed the check.

87
00:07:44,297 --> 00:07:47,091
Right. Well done.

88
00:07:47,175 --> 00:07:50,303
Can we at least leak that to the press?

89
00:07:50,386 --> 00:07:53,097
No, never. I didn't do it for publicity.

90
00:07:54,807 --> 00:07:57,518
So this is what you're trying to say.

91
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:59,103
What your right hand did--

92
00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,646
Don't let your enemies know.

93
00:08:00,730 --> 00:08:03,524
That describes this situation perfectly.
Good job.

94
00:08:04,609 --> 00:08:05,443
What?

95
00:08:05,526 --> 00:08:06,777
There's the Anthony I know.

96
00:08:07,862 --> 00:08:09,322
You haven't changed.

97
00:08:09,405 --> 00:08:10,823
I'll get going then.

98
00:08:10,907 --> 00:08:13,409
-Stay for lunch.
-No, maybe some other time.

99
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,745
Dear Gyeong-sik, take care.

100
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:17,246
I wish you well.

101
00:08:29,967 --> 00:08:31,761
Damn it.

102
00:08:31,844 --> 00:08:35,223
I'd love nothing more
than for him to come back

103
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:38,184
and pound me with his list of complaints.

104
00:08:39,644 --> 00:08:40,645
Me too.

105
00:08:42,063 --> 00:08:43,523
I miss him already.

106
00:08:53,241 --> 00:08:54,158
Gyeong-sik.

107
00:08:56,786 --> 00:08:58,788
Would you like to become an actor?

108
00:08:58,871 --> 00:08:59,914
What?

109
00:09:00,498 --> 00:09:01,666
Ta-da.

110
00:09:02,833 --> 00:09:03,751
There.

111
00:09:03,834 --> 00:09:05,378
What's all this?

112
00:09:05,461 --> 00:09:08,673
Do you know the meaning behind lettuce?

113
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,342
-What is it?
-Wrap…

114
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:14,595
your sadness and eat it away!

115
00:09:19,517 --> 00:09:21,811
Come on. That's so childish.

116
00:09:23,479 --> 00:09:24,438
But you smiled.

117
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,109
I'm glad I got a smile out of you.

118
00:09:30,361 --> 00:09:31,612
What happened to your finger?

119
00:09:32,572 --> 00:09:34,073
I cut myself while cooking.

120
00:09:34,782 --> 00:09:36,951
Are you okay? Is it bad?

121
00:09:37,034 --> 00:09:38,494
It's no big deal.

122
00:09:39,078 --> 00:09:41,455
It's been a while
since I've cooked, that's all.

123
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:45,501
You know…

124
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:49,714
I dreamed of Dad for the first time
since I arrived here.

125
00:09:51,549 --> 00:09:52,717
Dad?

126
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:55,636
I was brought back to the first day
I took photos outdoors

127
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,722
with the camera Dad bought me.

128
00:09:58,556 --> 00:09:59,640
The first day?

129
00:10:01,976 --> 00:10:05,605
But then I heard Grandma's voice.

130
00:10:07,940 --> 00:10:11,235
You don't think something's
happened to her, do you?

131
00:10:13,237 --> 00:10:14,322
Don't be ridiculous.

132
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,409
I'm worried sick about her.

133
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:20,328
Remember what the shaman said?

134
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,915
I'm only alive
because someone's preventing my death.

135
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,296
It's why I was afraid you might
have gotten hurt because of me.

136
00:10:30,379 --> 00:10:32,089
That's not it.

137
00:10:32,173 --> 00:10:34,300
And Grandma's doing much better.

138
00:10:34,383 --> 00:10:37,678
What if she falls unconscious
because of me again?

139
00:10:37,762 --> 00:10:40,598
Then, let's go
and see her after breakfast.

140
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:44,935
But once you see that she's okay,

141
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:47,647
you have to stop worrying.

142
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:54,695
I want to sleep with Grandma tonight.

143
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:56,238
Sure, let's do that.

144
00:10:57,698 --> 00:11:00,785
Anyway, eat your breakfast first.

145
00:11:01,744 --> 00:11:03,120
Ta-da.

146
00:11:04,372 --> 00:11:05,331
Who is it?

147
00:11:05,414 --> 00:11:08,250
Ha-ni, can we talk?

148
00:11:08,334 --> 00:11:09,460
Hey, Anthony.

149
00:11:12,088 --> 00:11:13,089
Anthony.

150
00:11:15,466 --> 00:11:18,552
I'm no longer Anthony,
so call me Chun-sik.

151
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:22,848
Well, I saw your press conference.

152
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:27,061
It was quite admirable.

153
00:11:27,144 --> 00:11:28,396
As if.

154
00:11:29,647 --> 00:11:31,273
I owe it all to you and her.

155
00:11:31,357 --> 00:11:32,650
Thanks.

156
00:11:34,026 --> 00:11:35,778
Are you headed somewhere?

157
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,907
Rather than as Anthony,

158
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:43,702
I'm planning to see the world
as Yang Chun-sik.

159
00:11:44,870 --> 00:11:48,165
But first, I had something to tell you.

160
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,084
What is it?

161
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:55,506
Do you remember

162
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,970
the day you left me in the restroom
and ran off 20 years ago?

163
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:03,389
HOSU HIGH SCHOOL

164
00:12:03,472 --> 00:12:04,557
Chun-sik…

165
00:12:05,349 --> 00:12:06,642
let's break up.

166
00:12:08,227 --> 00:12:10,855
Have a great time with the toilet.

167
00:12:10,938 --> 00:12:11,939
Bye!

168
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,900
Ha-ni! You'll pay for this!

169
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:17,361
I was so angry that…

170
00:12:17,445 --> 00:12:18,529
Miss.

171
00:12:19,071 --> 00:12:20,364
I told the teacher…

172
00:12:20,448 --> 00:12:23,993
-Weren't you off to the hospital?
-Bahn Ha-ni, skipped school.

173
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,203
She fed me milk and went to an audition.

174
00:12:26,287 --> 00:12:27,997
-Now, I have diarrhea.
-What?

175
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,708
…that you went to the audition.

176
00:12:31,292 --> 00:12:33,335
Yes, please tell her off.

177
00:12:35,504 --> 00:12:37,173
Is this Ha-ni's mother?

178
00:12:37,256 --> 00:12:38,966
IT'S YOUR TURN TO BE THE NEW FIN.K.L.

179
00:12:39,049 --> 00:12:40,092
Bahn Ha-ni!

180
00:12:42,344 --> 00:12:45,890
That's why your parents
showed up at your audition.

181
00:12:47,516 --> 00:12:48,559
And then the accident…

182
00:12:51,353 --> 00:12:52,313
Ha-ni.

183
00:12:53,397 --> 00:12:54,773
Ha-ni.

184
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,527
Dad!

185
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,362
Oh, no.

186
00:13:08,704 --> 00:13:10,164
Your father…

187
00:13:13,209 --> 00:13:15,002
died because of me.

188
00:13:15,085 --> 00:13:16,003
I'm sorry.

189
00:13:16,629 --> 00:13:19,757
No, that was on me.

190
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:23,260
It's something that I have to own up to
and take responsibility for.

191
00:13:25,888 --> 00:13:27,723
I'm truly grateful

192
00:13:28,766 --> 00:13:30,059
for your honesty though.

193
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:35,731
Bahn Ha-ni sure is different.

194
00:13:37,733 --> 00:13:38,901
Anthony…

195
00:13:40,402 --> 00:13:41,529
and even Yang Chun-sik.

196
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:47,326
I get why you've always
had a place in their hearts.

197
00:13:52,915 --> 00:13:54,333
Chun-sik left?

198
00:13:55,084 --> 00:13:56,001
Yes.

199
00:13:57,044 --> 00:13:58,754
I should've said goodbye too.

200
00:13:59,964 --> 00:14:03,926
You helped him change his mind
and that he's grateful for.

201
00:14:04,468 --> 00:14:05,761
As if.

202
00:14:05,844 --> 00:14:08,430
All I did here was cause trouble.

203
00:14:08,514 --> 00:14:09,682
No way.

204
00:14:10,224 --> 00:14:12,434
Come to think of it, you're like…

205
00:14:15,521 --> 00:14:16,647
a rugby ball.

206
00:14:17,398 --> 00:14:19,441
No one knows where you'll bounce off to,

207
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:23,696
but you do so
in a way that changes our lives.

208
00:14:25,531 --> 00:14:28,117
Thanks for saying that.

209
00:14:35,499 --> 00:14:38,836
Unbelievable. Is he drunk or what?

210
00:14:42,214 --> 00:14:43,173
Are you all right?

211
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:45,676
Yes.

212
00:14:49,513 --> 00:14:50,890
Hey.

213
00:14:50,973 --> 00:14:52,766
Don't let your mind wander again.

214
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,603
A lot of people drive
like maniacs these days.

215
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:58,480
Especially in alleyways like this.

216
00:15:11,452 --> 00:15:12,620
"Three days"?

217
00:15:14,455 --> 00:15:15,998
I only have three days left.

218
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,836
Come on. Let's not keep Mom waiting.

219
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,407
-Dad.
-Yes?

220
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,326
Aunt is here.

221
00:15:57,915 --> 00:15:59,166
How have you been?

222
00:15:59,833 --> 00:16:01,377
Why are you here?

223
00:16:02,753 --> 00:16:04,713
To laugh at my pathetic situation?

224
00:16:07,591 --> 00:16:10,260
Ji-suk, I'm sorry.

225
00:16:11,804 --> 00:16:15,557
I should've been more attentive
to your needs.

226
00:16:16,976 --> 00:16:19,645
If only I had listened to you more

227
00:16:19,728 --> 00:16:23,023
and made sure that
you were satisfied with your life.

228
00:16:25,025 --> 00:16:28,112
Please forgive
your pathetic older brother.

229
00:16:31,615 --> 00:16:35,494
Don't ever come back
if that's all you have to say.

230
00:16:37,246 --> 00:16:38,455
Ji-suk,

231
00:16:40,249 --> 00:16:42,292
I missed you so much.

232
00:16:46,296 --> 00:16:48,716
It kills me to think that my ugly side

233
00:16:51,593 --> 00:16:53,804
was what you saw last.

234
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,725
I was blinded by greed,

235
00:16:58,308 --> 00:16:59,268
and I…

236
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:11,947
I'm sorry, Ji-man.

237
00:17:13,949 --> 00:17:15,701
Yu-hyeon, you too.

238
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,455
I'm sorry to have acted so shamefully.

239
00:17:22,124 --> 00:17:23,167
Aunt.

240
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,502
Come back to us soon.

241
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:28,172
Without you,

242
00:17:28,255 --> 00:17:32,134
life has been too lonely for us.

243
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,883
Grandma.

244
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:17,679
Sweetheart, is that you?

245
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:24,978
Do you feel okay?

246
00:18:25,562 --> 00:18:28,148
Don't worry about me.

247
00:18:28,232 --> 00:18:31,652
Seeing you smile is more than enough

248
00:18:33,445 --> 00:18:36,406
to make me feel better.

249
00:18:36,490 --> 00:18:39,409
I'm sorry, Grandma.

250
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,703
It's all because of me.

251
00:18:42,329 --> 00:18:46,250
You're sick because I'm here.

252
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:49,086
Don't be sorry.

253
00:18:50,045 --> 00:18:53,966
And the fact that you're here again

254
00:18:55,759 --> 00:18:59,471
feels like a dream to me. I feel so happy.

255
00:19:02,808 --> 00:19:04,017
Ha-ni.

256
00:19:05,602 --> 00:19:07,354
As you live life,

257
00:19:08,605 --> 00:19:13,193
you'll come across painful moments
that you can't run away from.

258
00:19:14,278 --> 00:19:15,195
When that happens,

259
00:19:16,196 --> 00:19:18,991
close your eyes

260
00:19:20,617 --> 00:19:24,913
and count to three.

261
00:19:26,248 --> 00:19:27,791
When you open your eyes again,

262
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:30,294
you'll realize

263
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:35,799
that you've become a little bit stronger.

264
00:19:37,259 --> 00:19:38,302
Grandma.

265
00:19:39,803 --> 00:19:40,679
I love you.

266
00:19:50,147 --> 00:19:52,774
Why are you suddenly looking through
our family photos?

267
00:19:53,317 --> 00:19:56,987
I'm hoping I might be able
to find some clues to send her back.

268
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:11,043
These are the photos Dad and I took
on that trip.

269
00:20:11,126 --> 00:20:15,505
I used to nag at you guys
for always taking photos.

270
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:20,219
But now that I look at them,
they're all very nice memories.

271
00:20:24,181 --> 00:20:25,140
This is…

272
00:20:25,849 --> 00:20:26,683
What is it?

273
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,941
It's here.

274
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,025
What?

275
00:20:36,151 --> 00:20:37,778
The place I dreamed of last night.

276
00:20:40,906 --> 00:20:43,033
Then was this the first place

277
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,453
we went with Dad to take photos?

278
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:53,961
What is this a photo of?

279
00:21:00,676 --> 00:21:01,802
Yu-hyeon.

280
00:21:03,762 --> 00:21:05,430
Where were you guys?

281
00:21:05,514 --> 00:21:07,849
At my sister's place to visit our grandma.

282
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,226
I see.

283
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:11,812
Do you guys like Chinese food?

284
00:21:16,108 --> 00:21:18,277
Why are you suddenly
making us jjajangmyeon?

285
00:21:18,360 --> 00:21:20,153
She was really craving it

286
00:21:20,237 --> 00:21:22,739
in front of the convenience store
last time.

287
00:21:25,450 --> 00:21:26,994
How do you remember that?

288
00:21:27,077 --> 00:21:29,579
I remember everything
that has anything to do with you.

289
00:21:30,872 --> 00:21:31,873
Gross.

290
00:21:31,957 --> 00:21:33,292
He definitely is a gigolo.

291
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:34,584
Cut it out.

292
00:21:36,420 --> 00:21:38,130
-Can you take out the dishes?
-Sure.

293
00:21:44,344 --> 00:21:45,637
Are you okay?

294
00:21:56,064 --> 00:21:57,316
You'll hurt your hands.

295
00:22:08,368 --> 00:22:10,037
Don't get any funny ideas.

296
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,788
My hands slipped. That's all.

297
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:22,549
It's turning black again.

298
00:22:34,561 --> 00:22:35,771
Old lady.

299
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:38,106
If you keep being nervous,

300
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:40,776
she'll feel even more nervous.

301
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,988
But we only have two days left.

302
00:22:46,406 --> 00:22:48,992
What if she fails to go back?

303
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:51,203
What if something happens?

304
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,580
Nothing happened yet.

305
00:22:53,663 --> 00:22:55,457
Plus, you have me.

306
00:22:55,540 --> 00:22:57,959
I'll come running if anything happens.

307
00:22:58,043 --> 00:22:59,795
So feel free to call me whenever.

308
00:23:02,214 --> 00:23:03,215
Thank you so much.

309
00:23:03,924 --> 00:23:06,676
You need to stop thanking me
and apologizing to me.

310
00:23:07,511 --> 00:23:08,637
We're a team.

311
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:12,808
I'll be off now.

312
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:26,988
Dad, help.

313
00:23:30,367 --> 00:23:32,160
So that she won't get hurt.

314
00:23:34,538 --> 00:23:36,623
So that she can get back safely.

315
00:23:41,128 --> 00:23:42,629
Please, help me.

316
00:23:51,471 --> 00:23:52,681
What are you praying for?

317
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:55,725
Nothing.

318
00:24:00,438 --> 00:24:01,940
It's all because of me.

319
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,945
It's because I'm here.
That's why Grandma's sick,

320
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,865
and you keep getting hurt.

321
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:11,074
That's not true.

322
00:24:12,409 --> 00:24:13,410
And…

323
00:24:14,703 --> 00:24:16,246
you'll make it back safely.

324
00:24:19,541 --> 00:24:23,128
To be honest, I was scared to go back.

325
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,549
If I go back,
I'll have to face Dad's death.

326
00:24:29,092 --> 00:24:29,926
But…

327
00:24:31,011 --> 00:24:33,221
I don't want to put you in danger either.

328
00:24:33,305 --> 00:24:34,306
I know.

329
00:24:35,640 --> 00:24:37,142
I also feel heartbroken.

330
00:24:37,767 --> 00:24:41,313
I can't seem to send you back,
or let you stay here.

331
00:24:43,231 --> 00:24:44,065
But…

332
00:24:46,568 --> 00:24:48,445
I won't let anything dangerous

333
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:55,619
happen to you.

334
00:25:26,316 --> 00:25:27,400
Dad.

335
00:25:30,570 --> 00:25:32,197
Dad.

336
00:26:35,051 --> 00:26:37,721
Ha-ni, over here.

337
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:41,308
Over here.

338
00:26:46,980 --> 00:26:48,023
You need to go.

339
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,736
It's time.

340
00:26:56,114 --> 00:26:57,115
Ha-ni.

341
00:27:02,287 --> 00:27:04,789
Could that place be the way back?

342
00:28:15,819 --> 00:28:20,281
I think I finally found the way back.

343
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:24,411
I couldn't bring myself
to say goodbye to you,

344
00:28:25,954 --> 00:28:27,956
so I'm leaving you a letter instead.

345
00:28:37,841 --> 00:28:39,300
Have you lost your mind?

346
00:28:39,801 --> 00:28:41,344
Watch where you're going.

347
00:28:51,855 --> 00:28:52,897
I'll be fine.

348
00:28:53,857 --> 00:28:56,067
I'll be fine. Don't be scared.

349
00:29:02,198 --> 00:29:05,493
Thank you for protecting me until now.

350
00:29:07,328 --> 00:29:09,247
This time, it's my turn to protect you.

351
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:11,666
I'll go back as fast as I can

352
00:29:12,542 --> 00:29:15,295
so you can become happy again.

353
00:29:21,551 --> 00:29:22,886
Old lady!

354
00:29:24,971 --> 00:29:26,181
Did you find her?

355
00:29:26,765 --> 00:29:28,475
Get in.

356
00:29:35,982 --> 00:29:38,026
This was where I first met her.

357
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,361
Come to think of it, I met her here too.

358
00:29:53,041 --> 00:29:54,709
Where could she have gone?

359
00:29:56,211 --> 00:29:58,171
She's probably all alone and scared.

360
00:30:00,048 --> 00:30:02,008
I don't get how she's going to go back.

361
00:30:04,219 --> 00:30:06,679
Is there anywhere else we can check?

362
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:23,738
No, she's not here either.

363
00:30:24,739 --> 00:30:27,408
What did she write in the letter?

364
00:30:29,202 --> 00:30:30,328
She said she'll go back

365
00:30:30,411 --> 00:30:33,665
as fast as she can
so I can become happy again.

366
00:30:33,748 --> 00:30:36,543
"So you can become happy again"?

367
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:44,133
Lily of the valley?

368
00:30:44,217 --> 00:30:45,426
What? What is it?

369
00:30:46,553 --> 00:30:49,848
-She told me she dreamt of Dad yesterday.
-A dream?

370
00:30:54,561 --> 00:30:55,728
No way.

371
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:03,528
It's where I went to take photos
with my dad for the very first time.

372
00:31:06,823 --> 00:31:10,118
I took photos with the film camera
that my dad had bought for me.

373
00:31:10,618 --> 00:31:12,912
The photos were a mess,

374
00:31:12,996 --> 00:31:16,833
but he was really happy to see
my first work of art.

375
00:31:18,251 --> 00:31:20,545
Do you think that's where it is?

376
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:21,963
The way for her to go back.

377
00:31:23,715 --> 00:31:24,716
Yes.

378
00:31:26,175 --> 00:31:28,011
That's where it might be.

379
00:31:32,849 --> 00:31:36,561
That was where I found
this lily of the valley.

380
00:31:36,644 --> 00:31:38,271
I found it inside the tunnel

381
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:42,650
where I got lost.

382
00:31:43,735 --> 00:31:44,861
Ha-ni!

383
00:31:47,447 --> 00:31:48,448
Ha-ni.

384
00:31:50,158 --> 00:31:52,368
Ha-ni!

385
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:04,881
Ha-ni.

386
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:13,806
Why did you come inside the tunnel?
It's dangerous.

387
00:32:13,890 --> 00:32:14,974
Do you know

388
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,310
how much I looked for you?

389
00:32:17,393 --> 00:32:20,688
I saw a pretty flower
right outside the tunnel,

390
00:32:20,772 --> 00:32:23,024
so I thought there might be more inside.

391
00:32:23,858 --> 00:32:26,110
But I accidentally slipped.

392
00:32:29,447 --> 00:32:30,615
Goodness.

393
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:34,494
Gosh, it's really swollen.

394
00:32:35,203 --> 00:32:36,996
You should've been more careful.

395
00:32:37,997 --> 00:32:39,457
Let's go check that place out.

396
00:32:39,540 --> 00:32:42,460
There's definitely something there.

397
00:32:42,543 --> 00:32:46,756
You fool, it's hard for flowers
to grow in a place like this.

398
00:32:46,839 --> 00:32:48,841
I think you were mistaken.

399
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:50,551
No, there are flowers here.

400
00:32:50,635 --> 00:32:53,179
I found one. Look over there.

401
00:32:57,725 --> 00:32:59,352
Hey, you're right.

402
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:02,063
I told you so.

403
00:33:07,318 --> 00:33:08,444
Here.

404
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,155
It's a lily of the valley.

405
00:33:11,864 --> 00:33:15,159
Do you know the meaning
behind this flower?

406
00:33:15,243 --> 00:33:17,120
There's a meaning behind this one too?

407
00:33:17,745 --> 00:33:18,621
What is it?

408
00:33:18,705 --> 00:33:21,290
"Finding happiness again."

409
00:33:22,834 --> 00:33:25,003
What a beautiful meaning.

410
00:33:25,086 --> 00:33:26,337
"Finding happiness again."

411
00:33:28,715 --> 00:33:31,926
I'll make you a pretty keychain
with that flower.

412
00:33:32,677 --> 00:33:34,345
Ba ba ba

413
00:33:56,659 --> 00:33:57,785
Ha-ni!

414
00:34:03,082 --> 00:34:04,834
How did you find me here?

415
00:34:04,917 --> 00:34:06,544
Did you think I wouldn't know?

416
00:34:07,336 --> 00:34:08,838
I'm Bahn Ha-ni.

417
00:34:09,547 --> 00:34:10,381
I'm…

418
00:34:11,174 --> 00:34:12,091
I'm you.

419
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:14,177
I'm sorry

420
00:34:14,927 --> 00:34:16,596
that I left without saying anything.

421
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:19,057
It's okay. I understand.

422
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,560
I couldn't bring myself to say goodbye.

423
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:26,981
I already have to say goodbye to Dad
once I go back.

424
00:34:28,649 --> 00:34:31,152
I just couldn't bring myself
to say goodbye to you too.

425
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:32,195
Me too.

426
00:34:32,820 --> 00:34:36,866
I'm just as scared as you are
to say goodbye to you.

427
00:34:40,369 --> 00:34:43,873
But you can't just leave
without saying goodbye.

428
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:45,166
I'm sorry.

429
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,669
I had to leave as quickly as possible
to protect you.

430
00:34:57,386 --> 00:34:59,722
1 DAY LEFT

431
00:35:08,689 --> 00:35:11,025
I finally get what Dad meant

432
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,319
when he told me to find the way.

433
00:35:14,737 --> 00:35:15,863
Right.

434
00:35:16,489 --> 00:35:20,243
That must be why he showed up in my dream
and told me about this place.

435
00:35:21,702 --> 00:35:22,620
Thank you.

436
00:35:23,621 --> 00:35:26,749
I was lost for the past 20 years,

437
00:35:27,667 --> 00:35:29,836
but you helped me find my way again.

438
00:35:29,919 --> 00:35:33,422
Thank you for coming here
so I wouldn't have to go alone.

439
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:39,887
I'll go with you until as far as I can.

440
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:45,226
Goodbye, kid.

441
00:35:45,309 --> 00:35:46,435
Thank you.

442
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:49,021
I had a great time
thanks to you, Blue Bird.

443
00:35:51,232 --> 00:35:53,276
Thank you for saving me

444
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,279
when I was young, Ha-ni.

445
00:35:59,532 --> 00:36:00,533
Goodbye.

446
00:36:10,418 --> 00:36:11,752
Shall we go?

447
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:13,171
Yes.

448
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:50,875
Our journey together

449
00:36:51,709 --> 00:36:55,588
May be difficult

450
00:36:55,671 --> 00:36:58,216
But you can always

451
00:36:58,799 --> 00:37:02,887
Count on me

452
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:10,311
Do you finally understand

453
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:14,023
The hopes I have for you?

454
00:37:14,106 --> 00:37:17,360
With this small heart of mine

455
00:37:17,443 --> 00:37:21,530
I love you

456
00:37:22,823 --> 00:37:25,952
-Stay
-Stay

457
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:30,873
-By my side forever
-By my side forever

458
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:34,210
-I want you
-I want you

459
00:37:34,293 --> 00:37:38,923
-To fulfill my dream
-To fulfill my dream

460
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,592
-Hear me out
-Hear me out

461
00:37:41,676 --> 00:37:46,222
-You will be
-You will be

462
00:37:46,305 --> 00:37:52,228
-My one and only
-My one and only

463
00:38:02,571 --> 00:38:05,116
I'll strive to live my life to the fullest

464
00:38:05,199 --> 00:38:07,910
so that your time here won't go to waste.

465
00:38:09,078 --> 00:38:10,538
So…

466
00:38:11,872 --> 00:38:13,833
don't resent yourself.

467
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:19,380
Do your best and hang in there.

468
00:38:21,507 --> 00:38:25,136
The life you'll lead

469
00:38:25,219 --> 00:38:27,596
will define me.

470
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,892
Thank you so much

471
00:38:33,394 --> 00:38:34,979
for coming into my life…

472
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:38,024
Bahn Ha-ni.

473
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:43,738
Take this.

474
00:38:45,823 --> 00:38:49,535
You said the meaning
behind lily of the valley was

475
00:38:49,618 --> 00:38:51,495
"finding happiness again."

476
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,291
I already found mine,

477
00:38:57,001 --> 00:38:58,294
so you should take it.

478
00:39:32,328 --> 00:39:34,455
As you live life,

479
00:39:35,122 --> 00:39:40,086
you'll come across painful moments
that you just can't run away from.

480
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:45,466
When that happens, close your eyes

481
00:39:46,008 --> 00:39:50,846
and count to three.

482
00:39:52,181 --> 00:39:54,100
When you open your eyes again,

483
00:39:54,767 --> 00:39:56,185
you'll realize

484
00:39:56,936 --> 00:40:01,482
that you've become a little bit stronger.

485
00:40:03,776 --> 00:40:04,860
One.

486
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:07,530
Two.

487
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:10,991
Three.

488
00:40:58,914 --> 00:41:01,542
BAHN GI-TAE

489
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:15,222
My princess.

490
00:41:17,558 --> 00:41:19,477
Did you get back safely?

491
00:41:23,814 --> 00:41:24,815
Dad…

492
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,699
I'm sorry.

493
00:41:35,451 --> 00:41:37,036
I really am.

494
00:41:42,583 --> 00:41:44,001
It's okay.

495
00:41:47,421 --> 00:41:48,547
Ha-ni.

496
00:41:52,134 --> 00:41:53,511
Thank you for everything.

497
00:42:06,398 --> 00:42:09,693
Dad…

498
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,397
Are you okay, old lady?

499
00:42:50,818 --> 00:42:52,653
I'm fine.

500
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,282
But she…

501
00:42:58,993 --> 00:42:59,994
But she…

502
00:43:02,288 --> 00:43:04,290
I'm worried about her.

503
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,395
Did she really go back?

504
00:43:37,239 --> 00:43:38,449
I hope she won't be

505
00:43:40,075 --> 00:43:42,202
in too much pain.

506
00:43:44,371 --> 00:43:46,457
Had I known she'd leave so suddenly,

507
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:49,084
I would've treated her better.

508
00:44:03,682 --> 00:44:05,643
Hello, my puppy.

509
00:44:09,146 --> 00:44:10,272
Grandma.

510
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:21,075
I'm sorry.

511
00:44:22,451 --> 00:44:23,661
I'm sorry

512
00:44:24,161 --> 00:44:27,581
that I've blamed you all these years.

513
00:44:31,919 --> 00:44:33,462
I'm sorry.

514
00:45:25,472 --> 00:45:28,183
Hello, me.

515
00:45:28,267 --> 00:45:30,060
How are you doing?

516
00:45:30,602 --> 00:45:32,229
My life has been the same

517
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:35,274
even after you've left.

518
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,361
Every day, I eat and go to work.

519
00:45:40,779 --> 00:45:43,031
-Isn't this so nice?
-It's so warm today.

520
00:45:43,115 --> 00:45:46,743
At times, I see my friends
that I've missed.

521
00:45:46,827 --> 00:45:48,078
That's my life.

522
00:45:52,166 --> 00:45:55,502
I haven't been out in a while.
This feels amazing.

523
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,923
I had no idea you still remembered
this place.

524
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:01,467
Of course, I do.

525
00:46:01,550 --> 00:46:04,595
We used to come here often after school.

526
00:46:05,971 --> 00:46:08,640
It feels awesome to come here
with you again.

527
00:46:08,724 --> 00:46:12,311
By the way, how's our team doing?

528
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:15,230
They love that you're not there
to keep an eye on them.

529
00:46:15,314 --> 00:46:17,774
They want you to take a longer leave.

530
00:46:19,026 --> 00:46:19,860
Really?

531
00:46:20,861 --> 00:46:24,364
Of course not.
They're all waiting for you.

532
00:46:24,448 --> 00:46:25,532
You startled me.

533
00:46:29,828 --> 00:46:30,829
Ji-eun.

534
00:46:31,997 --> 00:46:33,582
Should we be friends again?

535
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:35,584
What?

536
00:46:36,251 --> 00:46:39,004
Weren't we friends already?

537
00:46:40,881 --> 00:46:41,882
No.

538
00:46:42,466 --> 00:46:45,802
Not as the lousy
and immature 17-year-olds we once were,

539
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:51,058
but as mature 37-year-olds.

540
00:46:57,523 --> 00:46:58,607
Thank you,

541
00:46:59,191 --> 00:47:02,361
my friend, Bahn Ha-ni.

542
00:47:04,905 --> 00:47:07,908
Right. There has been
one huge change, though.

543
00:47:07,991 --> 00:47:09,284
TEAM LEADER
GO JEONG-DO

544
00:47:11,537 --> 00:47:14,706
Gosh. He's late on his first day.

545
00:47:14,790 --> 00:47:18,043
Rumor has it that he barely made it
into our company.

546
00:47:18,126 --> 00:47:22,714
What an impudent bastard.

547
00:47:27,386 --> 00:47:28,428
Hello, everyone.

548
00:47:28,512 --> 00:47:32,015
I'll be joining your team starting today.

549
00:47:32,599 --> 00:47:33,600
I'm Han Yu-hyeon.

550
00:47:45,612 --> 00:47:46,863
Hello, everyone.

551
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:49,491
It's time for the Joa Exercise.

552
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,785
Let's all get up

553
00:47:51,868 --> 00:47:54,162
and start the day with lots of energy.

554
00:48:11,096 --> 00:48:12,180
One.

555
00:48:13,056 --> 00:48:14,057
Two.

556
00:48:15,058 --> 00:48:16,018
Three.

557
00:48:17,144 --> 00:48:18,478
Four. Good job.

558
00:48:18,562 --> 00:48:19,855
One.

559
00:48:20,897 --> 00:48:21,815
Two.

560
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:23,900
Three.

561
00:48:24,651 --> 00:48:26,570
Four. Faster.

562
00:48:26,653 --> 00:48:30,240
One, two, three, four. One, two. Great.

563
00:48:30,324 --> 00:48:34,161
One, two, three, four. One, two. Good job.

564
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:35,329
One.

565
00:48:36,371 --> 00:48:37,497
Two.

566
00:48:38,206 --> 00:48:39,207
Three.

567
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,210
Four. Good job.

568
00:48:42,294 --> 00:48:43,128
One.

569
00:48:44,046 --> 00:48:45,047
Two.

570
00:48:45,797 --> 00:48:46,965
Three.

571
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,551
Four. Faster again.

572
00:48:49,635 --> 00:48:53,722
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

573
00:48:53,805 --> 00:48:57,351
One, two, three, four.
One, two. Slow down again.

574
00:48:57,434 --> 00:48:58,477
One.

575
00:48:59,478 --> 00:49:00,479
Two.

576
00:49:01,438 --> 00:49:02,439
Three.

577
00:49:03,315 --> 00:49:04,316
Four.

578
00:49:05,025 --> 00:49:08,862
One, two, three, four. One, two. Good job.

579
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:13,033
One, two, three, four.
One, two, three, four.

580
00:49:16,662 --> 00:49:19,081
After returning from his backpacking trip,

581
00:49:19,164 --> 00:49:21,333
Chun-sik has found something new.

582
00:49:27,756 --> 00:49:29,758
Here's one serving of tteokbokki.

583
00:49:30,384 --> 00:49:31,927
The salad bread is on the house.

584
00:49:32,010 --> 00:49:34,012
-Thank you.
-Enjoy your meal.

585
00:49:34,096 --> 00:49:35,305
CHUN'S KITCHEN

586
00:49:35,389 --> 00:49:36,223
Help us, Mr. Yang!

587
00:49:36,306 --> 00:49:38,308
-What is it?
-My friend is being bullied!

588
00:49:38,392 --> 00:49:41,144
What? Take me there. Those bastards…

589
00:49:41,853 --> 00:49:46,316
He's now a guardian angel for bullied kids

590
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:48,318
and the owner of Chun's Kitchen.

591
00:49:55,534 --> 00:49:57,035
You're doing well, Chun-sik!

592
00:49:57,119 --> 00:49:59,371
You startled me. Why are you here?

593
00:49:59,454 --> 00:50:01,248
What's with that attitude?

594
00:50:01,331 --> 00:50:03,959
You said I could come here whenever
I wanted

595
00:50:04,042 --> 00:50:05,585
since you bullied me 20 years ago!

596
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:07,754
Two servings of tteokbokki
for the price of one.

597
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:11,925
We're closed for the day, sir.

598
00:50:12,008 --> 00:50:13,468
Goodbye, now.

599
00:50:13,552 --> 00:50:15,053
Come on.

600
00:50:15,887 --> 00:50:17,806
You still have a lot.

601
00:50:22,310 --> 00:50:25,605
By the way, that looks like the jacket
I sold.

602
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:30,318
Yours was probably fake.

603
00:50:30,402 --> 00:50:32,028
This is from the department store.

604
00:50:32,112 --> 00:50:34,948
This is a one-of-a-kind limited edition.

605
00:50:37,242 --> 00:50:38,910
Let me see!

606
00:50:39,578 --> 00:50:41,371
See? Look at this.

607
00:50:41,455 --> 00:50:44,249
"HYH" Han Yu-hyeon! My initials are on it!

608
00:50:44,332 --> 00:50:45,834
Let me go. Let go.

609
00:50:45,917 --> 00:50:46,918
I said, let go.

610
00:50:49,546 --> 00:50:50,464
Hold on.

611
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:52,966
Don't tell me you're…

612
00:50:55,010 --> 00:50:56,344
Are you "Debt No More"?

613
00:50:56,428 --> 00:50:57,512
And you're…

614
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,097
"Box Office Domination"?

615
00:51:04,978 --> 00:51:09,691
Actually, my real name is Ha Yeon-u… Hu.

616
00:51:09,775 --> 00:51:11,318
It's Ha Yeon-hu.

617
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:14,029
As if. Everyone knows
that you're Yang Chun-sik.

618
00:51:14,112 --> 00:51:15,530
You're not fooling anyone!

619
00:51:18,325 --> 00:51:19,743
-Let go.
-Is this mine too?

620
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,411
Don't be absurd.

621
00:51:21,495 --> 00:51:23,705
-I'll just check my initials.
-Let go. It hurts.

622
00:51:23,789 --> 00:51:26,500
-It hurts.
-Don't pinch me!

623
00:51:26,583 --> 00:51:28,502
You're going to break my arm. My arm.

624
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:30,670
Don't scratch it. It hurts.

625
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,633
-Come here. Give me that.
-I'm right.

626
00:51:34,716 --> 00:51:36,551
-You're going to scratch it.
-"HYH".

627
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:38,094
It is mine, you idiot!

628
00:51:38,178 --> 00:51:41,223
You're probably the most curious

629
00:51:41,306 --> 00:51:43,099
about Mom and Ha-yeong.

630
00:51:44,976 --> 00:51:47,646
Mom moved into Ha-yeong's house.

631
00:51:48,563 --> 00:51:50,607
Grandma is staying at a nursing hospital.

632
00:51:50,690 --> 00:51:52,609
-We visit her on the weekends.
-Is it good?

633
00:51:52,692 --> 00:51:54,194
Eat up, Mother.

634
00:51:54,277 --> 00:51:56,571
Who are you?

635
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:58,657
Why are you eating with us?

636
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:02,202
Mother, she's Ha-ni.

637
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:15,966
You look so pale.

638
00:52:16,591 --> 00:52:21,054
You should have a big appetite
if you're young.

639
00:52:23,515 --> 00:52:26,184
Try this. It's tasty.

640
00:52:27,102 --> 00:52:29,479
Thank you, Grandma.

641
00:52:31,439 --> 00:52:34,734
You look like my granddaughter
when you smile.

642
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:37,237
How pretty.

643
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,282
Is your granddaughter pretty?

644
00:52:40,866 --> 00:52:45,370
You bet. She's the most beautiful girl
in the world.

645
00:52:45,453 --> 00:52:47,038
She's my little puppy.

646
00:52:48,373 --> 00:52:50,083
Grandma. What about me?

647
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:53,503
Ok-jeong.

648
00:52:53,587 --> 00:52:57,132
Why did you bring this ugly girl again?

649
00:52:57,215 --> 00:52:58,675
I'm sorry, Mother.

650
00:52:59,217 --> 00:53:01,052
-They say you and I look alike.
-Hey.

651
00:53:01,136 --> 00:53:02,971
Don't say that.

652
00:53:10,854 --> 00:53:13,690
My beautiful, little puppy.

653
00:53:15,817 --> 00:53:17,736
My dear puppy.

654
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:21,072
I love you.

655
00:53:22,115 --> 00:53:24,784
I love you even more, Grandma.

656
00:53:34,294 --> 00:53:36,922
Right, Yu-hyeon and I

657
00:53:37,005 --> 00:53:40,050
-are slowly getting to know each other.
-It's warm.

658
00:53:42,302 --> 00:53:43,929
He's a chairman now?

659
00:53:44,888 --> 00:53:49,351
Judging by how my dad gave
the position to Do-yun so quickly,

660
00:53:49,434 --> 00:53:52,354
maybe it was his plan all along.

661
00:54:00,737 --> 00:54:02,489
Left foot forward.

662
00:54:02,572 --> 00:54:04,199
Right foot back.

663
00:54:04,282 --> 00:54:05,867
Turn.

664
00:54:05,951 --> 00:54:08,244
Let's change partners.

665
00:54:08,328 --> 00:54:11,790
All right, then. Let's do it again.

666
00:54:11,873 --> 00:54:14,793
One, two, three. Two, two…

667
00:54:14,876 --> 00:54:17,837
Now, you finally know how your father felt

668
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,590
when you were busy having fun.

669
00:54:20,674 --> 00:54:23,009
I wasn't slacking off.

670
00:54:25,887 --> 00:54:27,472
I was busy getting these.

671
00:54:28,515 --> 00:54:30,058
It's amazing every single time.

672
00:54:30,850 --> 00:54:31,810
What is this?

673
00:54:31,893 --> 00:54:32,978
NAIL ARTISTRY CERTIFICATION

674
00:54:33,061 --> 00:54:35,271
You even got
a nail artistry certification.

675
00:54:35,355 --> 00:54:36,606
Please do mine.

676
00:54:42,153 --> 00:54:45,365
-What was that?
-I wanted to cherish your cute face.

677
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:47,367
No.

678
00:54:48,702 --> 00:54:49,828
Let's take one together.

679
00:54:50,996 --> 00:54:52,247
All right.

680
00:54:53,415 --> 00:54:55,458
One, two, three.

681
00:55:02,966 --> 00:55:04,009
Okay.

682
00:55:10,932 --> 00:55:11,933
You erased them.

683
00:55:23,028 --> 00:55:24,612
Old lady.

684
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:26,698
Close your eyes.

685
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,661
-Why?
-Just do it.

686
00:55:39,419 --> 00:55:41,463
Okay. Open them.

687
00:55:47,218 --> 00:55:48,428
Is this a gift?

688
00:55:48,511 --> 00:55:49,679
What?

689
00:55:50,597 --> 00:55:51,931
Why do you look disappointed?

690
00:55:53,141 --> 00:55:55,477
Wait. What were you expecting?

691
00:55:55,560 --> 00:55:58,229
I wasn't expecting anything.

692
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,149
Gosh, this is so pretty.

693
00:56:01,816 --> 00:56:04,152
I made it myself.

694
00:56:04,235 --> 00:56:06,613
Do you know the meaning behind freesias?

695
00:56:07,322 --> 00:56:10,241
I only know the meaning behind lettuce.

696
00:56:11,743 --> 00:56:15,955
They mean "a new beginning."

697
00:56:19,084 --> 00:56:20,627
Thank you.

698
00:56:22,754 --> 00:56:24,172
I have something for you too.

699
00:56:24,255 --> 00:56:26,216
-What is it?
-Close your eyes.

700
00:56:26,800 --> 00:56:29,219
-What is it?
-Close your eyes first.

701
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:34,933
I'm really going to be disappointed
if you give me snacks or something.

702
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:38,228
Keep them shut.

703
00:56:38,311 --> 00:56:39,354
Okay.

704
00:56:58,456 --> 00:56:59,749
Shall we go over there?

705
00:57:00,250 --> 00:57:01,626
I saw something pretty.

706
00:57:05,755 --> 00:57:06,881
Wait up!

707
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,977
Have you been waiting for a long time?
I'm sorry.

708
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,896
I'm sorry to make
the great Min Gyeong-sik wait.

709
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:22,939
I apologize.

710
00:57:24,774 --> 00:57:25,650
Jeong-man.

711
00:57:25,733 --> 00:57:28,403
Did you forget that I changed my name
ages ago?

712
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:32,574
Oh, right. I've been so used to that name
that it just came out. Sorry.

713
00:57:34,409 --> 00:57:36,161
-Say it.
-What?

714
00:57:36,244 --> 00:57:38,496
Alexandro.

715
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:43,334
-What?
-"Dro."

716
00:57:45,420 --> 00:57:46,588
"Alexandro."

717
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,134
You're good. Call me that, okay?

718
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:52,927
Let's do that.

719
00:57:54,846 --> 00:57:57,307
What is this? Americano?

720
00:57:58,016 --> 00:58:00,185
Didn't I tell you I wanted a cafe latte?

721
00:58:00,268 --> 00:58:02,770
I was so used to buying coffee
for Anthony that I…

722
00:58:02,854 --> 00:58:04,856
I told you not to bring him up.

723
00:58:05,523 --> 00:58:06,524
-Get me a new one.
-Okay.

724
00:58:06,608 --> 00:58:08,359
It's so bitter.

725
00:58:08,443 --> 00:58:09,569
I should gargle.

726
00:58:10,528 --> 00:58:11,863
Don't you forget.

727
00:58:11,946 --> 00:58:13,865
Two shots of espresso and a lot of milk.

728
00:58:13,948 --> 00:58:15,366
Unbelievable.

729
00:58:19,579 --> 00:58:22,165
He's worse than Anthony.

730
00:58:22,248 --> 00:58:25,084
Had Scarlett been here,
she would've taught him a lesson.

731
00:58:26,419 --> 00:58:29,506
Hello, everyone. I'm Kim Ji-hyeong
from Endless Challenges.

732
00:58:29,589 --> 00:58:32,383
I'm here with two very special guests.

733
00:58:32,467 --> 00:58:35,970
They're in the Guinness World Records
for signing up for the most challenges.

734
00:58:36,054 --> 00:58:38,264
They're brothers Na Yeong-gu and Na Il-gu.

735
00:58:38,348 --> 00:58:39,849
Hello.

736
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:42,185
You two are truly incredible.

737
00:58:42,268 --> 00:58:46,439
May I ask you why
you've been challenging yourselves nonstop

738
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:47,982
for almost 40 years?

739
00:58:48,066 --> 00:58:51,277
For a very long time,
we had run a small store.

740
00:58:51,361 --> 00:58:55,156
We were average Joes
who had no particular talents.

741
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,701
But challenging ourselves
to new things every day

742
00:58:58,785 --> 00:59:02,080
gave us strength and courage.

743
00:59:02,163 --> 00:59:05,333
It doesn't matter even if you collapse
or fail every day.

744
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:07,961
When that happens, tell yourself this.

745
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:09,671
"You're doing well.

746
00:59:09,754 --> 00:59:12,507
You're the most magnificent star
in your life.

747
00:59:12,590 --> 00:59:15,218
That is, if you refuse to give up

748
00:59:15,301 --> 00:59:17,053
and get back on your feet once again."

749
00:59:38,992 --> 00:59:41,369
That was the toughest and loneliest day

750
00:59:41,452 --> 00:59:42,954
in my entire life.

751
00:59:44,789 --> 00:59:48,876
I wanted someone to embrace me.

752
00:59:51,212 --> 00:59:53,965
That's when a miracle happened.

753
00:59:55,216 --> 00:59:57,927
Me from 20 years ago visited me.

754
00:59:59,679 --> 01:00:02,181
"Hello, me."

755
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:06,519
And since that day…

756
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:13,067
I gained the courage to start anew.

757
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:20,700
You'll probably never get this letter,

758
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,704
but nevertheless,
I wanted to tell you this.

759
01:00:29,083 --> 01:00:32,045
I love you, Bahn Ha-ni.

760
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,048
And…

761
01:00:36,382 --> 01:00:39,052
goodbye, me.

762
01:01:44,325 --> 01:01:46,494
Twenty years from now?

763
01:01:46,577 --> 01:01:47,829
LETTER TO MYSELF 20 YEARS LATER

764
01:01:47,912 --> 01:01:49,622
It's a frightening thought.

765
01:01:50,623 --> 01:01:53,292
How old would I look at the age of 37?

766
01:01:55,461 --> 01:01:57,422
I can't picture it,

767
01:01:57,505 --> 01:01:59,799
but I'd like to tell my future self this.

768
01:02:00,800 --> 01:02:02,552
Dear future me,

769
01:02:03,553 --> 01:02:06,806
it's okay if you didn't turn out
the way I wanted,

770
01:02:07,932 --> 01:02:12,353
because I'm still the one who loves
and roots for you the most.

771
01:02:15,314 --> 01:02:16,399
So tell me.

772
01:02:17,442 --> 01:02:19,652
Can you confidently say
that you cherish me

773
01:02:20,528 --> 01:02:22,196
every single day?

774
01:02:25,742 --> 01:02:29,746
