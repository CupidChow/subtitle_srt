EPISODE 11

2
00:01:05,023 --> 00:01:06,024
What the hell?

3
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:11,529
My gosh. Seriously?

4
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,655
Who on earth are you?

5
00:01:14,574 --> 00:01:16,451
I went to the salon early in the morning.

6
00:01:19,079 --> 00:01:21,706
-Do I look weird?
-Of course not!

7
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:23,541
You look perfect!

8
00:01:24,709 --> 00:01:27,670
Your hair and outfit today

9
00:01:27,754 --> 00:01:30,298
make you seem like a true businesswoman.

10
00:01:30,381 --> 00:01:31,424
I'm glad.

11
00:01:31,925 --> 00:01:34,427
I see you put in the effort
for today's presentation.

12
00:01:34,511 --> 00:01:36,179
That too…

13
00:01:38,223 --> 00:01:40,141
But I wanted to show myself

14
00:01:41,601 --> 00:01:43,102
that I can change.

15
00:01:45,104 --> 00:01:47,273
I'm proud of you, Bahn Ha-ni.

16
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:54,239
I'll get going then.

17
00:01:55,073 --> 00:01:56,407
Go, go, Bahn Ha-ni

18
00:01:56,491 --> 00:01:58,201
You're the best in the world

19
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,788
I'm falling for you,
The charming, Bahn Ha-ni

20
00:02:02,330 --> 00:02:03,832
I can do it!

21
00:02:15,051 --> 00:02:16,636
2020 JOA CONFECTIONERY
IDEA CONTEST PRESENTATION

22
00:02:20,431 --> 00:02:21,683
I hardly recognized you.

23
00:02:22,433 --> 00:02:23,476
It looks good on you.

24
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:25,520
-Do I look okay?
-Yes.

25
00:02:26,855 --> 00:02:28,523
That reminds me. Did you get it?

26
00:02:28,606 --> 00:02:31,818
Yes, my cousin-in-law
hadn't thrown it out yet.

27
00:02:32,485 --> 00:02:34,028
Why do you need it though?

28
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:37,448
To start afresh.

29
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:40,285
What?

30
00:02:40,368 --> 00:02:42,996
Ms. Bahn Ha-ni,
please get ready for your presentation.

31
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:49,169
-I'll get going.
-Sure.

32
00:02:51,462 --> 00:02:52,338
Old lady!

33
00:02:53,673 --> 00:02:54,924
Just be yourself in there.

34
00:03:04,225 --> 00:03:07,437
Thank you for teaming up with me on this.

35
00:03:07,520 --> 00:03:09,814
I wouldn't have made it this far
without you.

36
00:03:10,523 --> 00:03:11,691
Of course.

37
00:03:13,776 --> 00:03:14,694
We're the best.

38
00:03:16,070 --> 00:03:17,030
Now, break a leg.

39
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,449
I'll head inside.

40
00:03:25,455 --> 00:03:26,664
All right. Thank you.

41
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:32,503
JUDGE

42
00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,423
The next presenter is ready.

43
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:37,300
We'll begin.

44
00:03:42,764 --> 00:03:44,349
2020 JOA CONFECTIONERY
IDEA CONTEST PRESENTATION

45
00:04:03,618 --> 00:04:07,205
Hello.
I'm here presenting for team Star Land.

46
00:04:07,288 --> 00:04:09,207
I work for the Product Development Team.

47
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:11,542
My name is Bahn Ha-ni.

48
00:04:21,594 --> 00:04:25,890
I've been praying for rain
every single day.

49
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,934
But I'll pray for something else today.

50
00:04:29,227 --> 00:04:30,270
Please give courage

51
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:34,190
to the 37-year-old me
so she can do well on her presentation.

52
00:04:44,867 --> 00:04:45,827
Hold on.

53
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,372
That's my phone.

54
00:04:52,917 --> 00:04:57,130
Before I was offered a position
on the Product Development Team,

55
00:04:57,213 --> 00:04:58,631
I worked at a supermarket.

56
00:04:59,215 --> 00:05:02,427
Squid is good, deliciously good

57
00:05:03,469 --> 00:05:07,098
I used to promote products
made by Joa Confectionery.

58
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:12,645
The Squid-good incident
that you're all aware of

59
00:05:14,022 --> 00:05:16,232
happened on my watch.

60
00:05:23,239 --> 00:05:25,366
While preparing for this presentation,

61
00:05:25,450 --> 00:05:28,411
the memories of that incident
came rushing back to me.

62
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:33,624
And then a friend
who was lactose intolerant

63
00:05:34,208 --> 00:05:36,461
also said this to me,

64
00:05:37,295 --> 00:05:40,506
that there are quite a lot of people
in this world

65
00:05:41,382 --> 00:05:44,594
who aren't able to eat
everything they want.

66
00:05:46,679 --> 00:05:49,599
That's when it hit me.

67
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:54,562
What if there was a product out there

68
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:58,775
that could be consumed by children
who are allergic?

69
00:06:00,151 --> 00:06:02,528
Alleviating that worry is what led me

70
00:06:02,612 --> 00:06:06,783
to come up with
the gluten-free snack Star Land.

71
00:06:22,673 --> 00:06:23,841
No way.

72
00:06:25,593 --> 00:06:26,761
Why would this ring?

73
00:06:28,888 --> 00:06:30,681
How can a call get through?

74
00:06:33,935 --> 00:06:36,270
Ha-ni. Bahn Ha-ni?

75
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,564
That voice…

76
00:06:38,648 --> 00:06:39,899
No way!

77
00:06:41,526 --> 00:06:43,861
It's Bald Eagle!

78
00:06:45,279 --> 00:06:46,656
Hey, Auntie.

79
00:06:47,615 --> 00:06:48,991
Why wasn't the door locked?

80
00:06:49,951 --> 00:06:52,870
-Where is your mom?
-She went to work.

81
00:06:53,788 --> 00:06:55,456
I've brought kimchi and some dishes.

82
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,125
-Put them in the fridge.
-Sure.

83
00:06:57,834 --> 00:06:59,794
By the way, did you make these yourself?

84
00:07:00,711 --> 00:07:02,797
I bought them at the department store.
Why?

85
00:07:03,464 --> 00:07:06,342
Well, if you had made them yourself,

86
00:07:06,425 --> 00:07:09,637
I'd have to worry
about them being poisonous.

87
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:12,473
-What?
-Just kidding.

88
00:07:15,309 --> 00:07:18,521
Gosh, look at this mess.

89
00:07:19,397 --> 00:07:20,731
Don't you bother to clean up?

90
00:07:20,815 --> 00:07:23,901
As if. We usually keep the house clean,

91
00:07:23,985 --> 00:07:26,028
but we've been busy lately.

92
00:07:34,287 --> 00:07:36,289
That's really not necessary.

93
00:07:39,333 --> 00:07:41,878
-Don't you have a vacuum?
-No, we don't.

94
00:07:43,963 --> 00:07:46,549
Wait. Shouldn't you be at school?

95
00:07:46,632 --> 00:07:50,386
-I don't attend one.
-What? How clueless can your mother be?

96
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:52,805
You've been back from the States
for a while now.

97
00:07:52,889 --> 00:07:54,932
I'll attend one once I go back but…

98
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:56,350
You're going back?

99
00:07:56,434 --> 00:07:58,144
I thought you were staying for good.

100
00:07:59,687 --> 00:08:00,980
Well…

101
00:08:02,482 --> 00:08:03,816
You see…

102
00:08:06,277 --> 00:08:07,278
Are you all right?

103
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,199
You're clumsy just like your mom.
Do you have a plaster?

104
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,250
The lily of the valley key ring!

105
00:08:23,794 --> 00:08:25,838
-Do you know what that is?
-Well, Dad…

106
00:08:29,175 --> 00:08:30,593
I mean…

107
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:36,849
You and my mom each got one from your dad.

108
00:08:38,017 --> 00:08:40,019
It was supposed to be a good luck charm.

109
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:51,322
There's some place I need to be,
so see yourself out.

110
00:08:51,405 --> 00:08:54,450
-Thanks for the dishes.
-Hey, where are you off to?

111
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:01,624
She's so easily distracted
just like her mother.

112
00:09:02,416 --> 00:09:03,834
Unbelievable.

113
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,432
Hold on. I can't believe
she still has this.

114
00:09:21,894 --> 00:09:24,188
Of course, you're right to worry about

115
00:09:24,272 --> 00:09:26,065
the target market being small

116
00:09:26,148 --> 00:09:27,858
which will result in low profit.

117
00:09:28,734 --> 00:09:31,779
It's why we tried hard
to come up with a flavor

118
00:09:31,862 --> 00:09:35,616
that appeals to others as well as
those who are lactose intolerant.

119
00:09:38,661 --> 00:09:41,414
Whenever I was having a bad day,

120
00:09:41,497 --> 00:09:44,875
my dad would take me
to a neighborhood corner shop

121
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:47,753
to buy me a packet of sweet snacks.

122
00:09:50,047 --> 00:09:52,008
It's what I still do at this age.

123
00:09:52,091 --> 00:09:54,760
I yearn for snacks whenever I feel down.

124
00:10:03,185 --> 00:10:04,645
Has the presentation begun?

125
00:10:06,022 --> 00:10:09,442
She went in a while ago, so yes.

126
00:10:11,193 --> 00:10:14,155
I was hoping she could
go in there with this.

127
00:10:14,238 --> 00:10:16,490
-What's that?
-A key ring.

128
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:22,121
Wait. That's the one
I gave to your mother.

129
00:10:22,705 --> 00:10:25,666
What? Why did you have this?

130
00:10:26,167 --> 00:10:29,503
I told you before
how we met a long time ago.

131
00:10:29,587 --> 00:10:31,672
She dropped it that day,

132
00:10:31,756 --> 00:10:34,675
and I only got to return it recently.

133
00:10:38,179 --> 00:10:40,514
So that's when I lost it!

134
00:10:41,223 --> 00:10:44,185
I looked all over the house for nothing.

135
00:10:46,354 --> 00:10:47,355
What?

136
00:10:51,233 --> 00:10:55,988
I mean, my mom told me that she turned
the whole house upside down to find it.

137
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:58,491
I see.

138
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:02,411
So, does this have some special meaning?

139
00:11:03,913 --> 00:11:06,290
-It's what the flower symbolizes.
-Which is what?

140
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:07,750
As if I'd tell you.

141
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:11,253
As if I want to know.

142
00:11:14,048 --> 00:11:17,593
Like so, snacks remind me
of the heartwarming times

143
00:11:17,676 --> 00:11:18,844
and bring me joy.

144
00:11:20,304 --> 00:11:24,683
It's why I want children
who are lactose intolerant

145
00:11:24,767 --> 00:11:29,355
to enjoy snacks instead of fearing them.

146
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:34,276
What could possibly be better than the act

147
00:11:37,321 --> 00:11:39,240
of bringing joy to others?

148
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,550
When will he get his next gig?

149
00:12:02,054 --> 00:12:03,764
Anthony, are you all right?

150
00:12:04,598 --> 00:12:05,433
I don't know.

151
00:12:10,604 --> 00:12:11,981
I've been feeling off lately.

152
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:14,275
Tell me your symptoms.

153
00:12:14,358 --> 00:12:15,985
My heart's pounding manically.

154
00:12:19,655 --> 00:12:21,198
And I have trouble breathing.

155
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:24,743
Could this be a panic attack?

156
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,622
-A panic attack?
-A lot of celebrities suffer from it.

157
00:12:28,706 --> 00:12:29,540
What else?

158
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:36,255
Nothing comes to mind when I close my eyes

159
00:12:37,465 --> 00:12:40,009
-except this.
-What's that?

160
00:12:41,177 --> 00:12:42,553
Ha-ni's smile.

161
00:12:45,514 --> 00:12:46,432
Anthony.

162
00:12:47,391 --> 00:12:48,976
I don't think it's a panic attack.

163
00:12:49,059 --> 00:12:51,437
-What is it then?
-It's obvious.

164
00:12:51,937 --> 00:12:52,771
You're lovesick.

165
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:56,692
Lovesick? Me? The great Anthony?

166
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,486
Anthony!

167
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,821
-I finally got the call.
-From Ha-ni?

168
00:13:00,905 --> 00:13:03,491
What the hell?
No, Ms. Kim's new drama series.

169
00:13:03,574 --> 00:13:05,367
Your audition has been scheduled.

170
00:13:06,285 --> 00:13:07,119
Really?

171
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,330
What's wrong? What's with that long face?

172
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:11,040
Wait, are you sick?

173
00:13:11,123 --> 00:13:14,043
I'm just worried since I must do my best.

174
00:13:15,211 --> 00:13:18,088
It is said that people used
to grill pork belly

175
00:13:18,172 --> 00:13:21,008
whenever something
needed to be celebrated.

176
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:24,428
Isn't jjajangmyeon
what you eat to celebrate?

177
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:27,306
-That's right. Jjajangmyeon.
-No, it's meat, of course.

178
00:13:29,058 --> 00:13:31,310
What on earth are we celebrating though?

179
00:13:31,393 --> 00:13:33,395
Us winning the contest.

180
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:34,980
But we haven't won yet.

181
00:13:35,064 --> 00:13:37,191
We all worked hard and you presented it.

182
00:13:37,274 --> 00:13:38,108
Of course, we won.

183
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:42,071
-Really?
-Well, probably.

184
00:13:43,197 --> 00:13:45,157
That being said, here.

185
00:13:45,824 --> 00:13:47,201
-Cheers!
-Cheers!

186
00:14:01,715 --> 00:14:05,010
The more I see you two,
the more you seem alike.

187
00:14:08,847 --> 00:14:10,975
-What?
-I'm right, aren't I?

188
00:14:11,767 --> 00:14:14,311
You like the same food
and you behave the same.

189
00:14:14,395 --> 00:14:17,648
On top of that,
she's the spitting image of you as a kid.

190
00:14:19,191 --> 00:14:22,027
And how would you even know
my face as a kid?

191
00:14:22,111 --> 00:14:23,320
Seriously?

192
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,407
You're the Superman

193
00:14:26,490 --> 00:14:29,577
who saved me from the bullies
that stole my mom's necklace.

194
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,413
When on earth did I save you?

195
00:14:34,248 --> 00:14:37,167
My gosh! How stupid of me.

196
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:38,878
I got it all on my blouse.

197
00:14:38,961 --> 00:14:40,713
Gosh. You should've been more careful.

198
00:14:40,796 --> 00:14:42,840
I know. What do I do with this?

199
00:14:42,923 --> 00:14:45,801
This needs to be scrubbed with water.

200
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,636
Come with me.

201
00:14:47,720 --> 00:14:49,555
Just do it yourself.

202
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:51,557
Come on!

203
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:53,934
Excuse us!

204
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:58,105
Seriously?

205
00:14:59,523 --> 00:15:01,525
She said her mom told her a few days ago,

206
00:15:01,609 --> 00:15:03,152
but the old lady seems clueless.

207
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:09,199
JOBS

208
00:15:11,869 --> 00:15:12,995
It's time.

209
00:15:13,078 --> 00:15:16,415
Come here with the girl
from the past before it's too late.

210
00:15:17,041 --> 00:15:18,000
What?

211
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:22,129
The girl from the past?

212
00:15:23,714 --> 00:15:26,342
That little boy is Yu-hyeon?

213
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:27,468
Yes.

214
00:15:27,551 --> 00:15:30,387
I was so surprised too.

215
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:36,977
Don't tell me
you let him know that you know.

216
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:41,982
-I did.
-What?

217
00:15:42,066 --> 00:15:44,485
I spilled food on purpose
to drag you out here

218
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:46,487
before he figured it out.

219
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:49,740
Don't you worry though.

220
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,701
No one would even think
to guess I'm from the past.

221
00:15:55,412 --> 00:15:57,873
You can have a son
without a husband, right?

222
00:15:58,749 --> 00:15:59,750
Mom.

223
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:04,546
I was wondering about
when Dad passed away.

224
00:16:06,173 --> 00:16:07,216
Yes?

225
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:11,845
Do you know if Ha-ni
had a boyfriend around that time?

226
00:16:11,929 --> 00:16:13,889
What? What are you talking about?

227
00:16:15,057 --> 00:16:19,103
Oh, I was just curious
if she could've been seeing someone

228
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:21,563
around the time I had Seong-u.

229
00:16:23,691 --> 00:16:25,359
Ever since the incident,

230
00:16:25,442 --> 00:16:28,278
she lived on antidepressants
and didn't leave the house

231
00:16:29,196 --> 00:16:32,199
unless it was to go and see the doctor.
So a boyfriend?

232
00:16:33,033 --> 00:16:35,452
She dropped out of high school

233
00:16:35,536 --> 00:16:39,665
and it took her three years
to finally move on and take the GED.

234
00:16:41,709 --> 00:16:42,918
Why do you ask though?

235
00:16:43,919 --> 00:16:45,838
Well, it's just that…

236
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,090
Then…

237
00:16:48,173 --> 00:16:51,051
do you know what medication
she used to take?

238
00:16:51,927 --> 00:16:53,220
Ha-ni!

239
00:16:53,303 --> 00:16:55,347
Mother?

240
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,975
Mother, what's wrong?

241
00:16:58,058 --> 00:17:00,227
The girl who came from the past?

242
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,565
What does that even mean?

243
00:17:10,612 --> 00:17:11,697
Sorry about that.

244
00:17:12,573 --> 00:17:15,492
The stain wouldn't come off.

245
00:17:15,576 --> 00:17:16,618
I know, right?

246
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:19,747
It's all right.
Let's eat up before the meat is burned.

247
00:17:26,128 --> 00:17:27,671
What are you looking at?

248
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:29,923
It's nothing.

249
00:17:38,057 --> 00:17:40,142
HEAVY RAIN EXPECTED TONIGHT
IN THE METROPOLITAN AREA

250
00:17:42,519 --> 00:17:43,812
It's going to rain tonight.

251
00:17:58,410 --> 00:18:00,454
Red to the east and white to the west.

252
00:18:00,537 --> 00:18:02,372
Fish to the east and meat to the west.

253
00:18:03,707 --> 00:18:05,417
The food is all ready.

254
00:18:06,710 --> 00:18:07,961
Wait.

255
00:18:12,841 --> 00:18:14,885
The colors are beautiful.

256
00:18:16,011 --> 00:18:17,054
Good job.

257
00:18:19,848 --> 00:18:22,142
I hope they get here
before it starts to rain.

258
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:31,276
What? Is there a blackout?

259
00:18:38,408 --> 00:18:39,827
Who are you?

260
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,456
How dare you show up here!

261
00:18:54,925 --> 00:18:56,552
I understand what you mean,

262
00:18:57,553 --> 00:19:00,013
but it looks like you've made
a big mistake.

263
00:19:05,435 --> 00:19:07,354
They will be in danger.

264
00:19:09,606 --> 00:19:11,692
We need to arrive before it rains.
Let's hurry.

265
00:19:11,775 --> 00:19:14,111
-Wait…
-Taxi!

266
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:16,196
Old Lady, where are you going?

267
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:21,827
I'm sorry. I'll explain next time.

268
00:19:24,788 --> 00:19:25,664
What…

269
00:19:28,250 --> 00:19:30,460
I'm sorry. I'll see you.

270
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:35,465
What just happened?

271
00:19:36,758 --> 00:19:38,802
Sir, you're getting a call.

272
00:19:38,886 --> 00:19:40,470
What? Oh, okay.

273
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:44,933
She even forgot her phone.

274
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:53,317
Does this mean I can go home now?

275
00:19:54,526 --> 00:19:55,652
But this is…

276
00:19:56,945 --> 00:19:57,946
all so sudden.

277
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,450
First…

278
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:04,119
let's go to the shaman.

279
00:20:23,597 --> 00:20:24,681
I'll make sure

280
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,267
to send you back.

281
00:20:37,819 --> 00:20:38,820
Oh, right.

282
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:42,032
I was there earlier to give you this.

283
00:20:42,115 --> 00:20:43,742
Why?

284
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,870
I thought it might help you with
your presentation.

285
00:20:47,955 --> 00:20:50,249
You know the meaning behind this flower.

286
00:20:50,832 --> 00:20:52,793
-Finding happiness again.
-Yes.

287
00:20:54,628 --> 00:20:57,172
So don't lose it.
Keep it with you at all times.

288
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,841
Okay, I will.

289
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,598
I'll never lose this keychain,
and I'll never lose

290
00:21:08,475 --> 00:21:10,102
my happiness either.

291
00:21:13,313 --> 00:21:14,648
But it's amazing, right?

292
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:17,985
-What do you mean?
-The fact that Blue Bird

293
00:21:18,068 --> 00:21:21,363
is the one who picked this up
and gave it back to you after 20 years.

294
00:21:26,326 --> 00:21:27,369
Yes, it really is.

295
00:21:32,874 --> 00:21:34,710
JOBS

296
00:21:35,877 --> 00:21:37,379
What took you so long to pick up?

297
00:21:38,171 --> 00:21:40,299
Don't come here with
the girl from the past. It's dangerous.

298
00:21:41,049 --> 00:21:42,801
What do you mean it's dangerous?

299
00:21:44,011 --> 00:21:45,137
Who are you?

300
00:21:48,682 --> 00:21:51,101
They're probably on their way here.

301
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,978
It's dangerous here, so stop them.

302
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,857
And they need to be somewhere safe
until it stops raining.

303
00:22:01,695 --> 00:22:04,573
By the way, do you know
where the payphone is?

304
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:07,075
What happened to Hyo-ri?

305
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:08,160
What about her?

306
00:22:08,243 --> 00:22:10,245
Hyo-ri got married?

307
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:11,538
That crybaby?

308
00:22:11,621 --> 00:22:13,206
The one who cried
after having his necklace stolen?

309
00:22:14,624 --> 00:22:17,085
You're the crybaby I saw a few days ago?

310
00:22:17,169 --> 00:22:18,545
No way!

311
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:26,386
You really have a beautiful smile.

312
00:22:32,809 --> 00:22:34,853
So that's when I lost it!

313
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,815
I looked all over the house for nothing.

314
00:22:43,445 --> 00:22:45,822
Sir, can you drive a bit faster?

315
00:22:45,906 --> 00:22:46,990
Okay.

316
00:22:58,752 --> 00:22:59,961
Aren't we there yet?

317
00:23:00,462 --> 00:23:02,130
I think it's going to rain soon.

318
00:23:03,965 --> 00:23:06,676
Is this the right way?

319
00:23:08,178 --> 00:23:11,098
Sir, do we still have a long way to go?

320
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:15,227
I'm following the navigation.

321
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:18,313
But this is also my first time here.

322
00:23:19,356 --> 00:23:21,149
Are you sure this is the right address?

323
00:23:21,733 --> 00:23:24,277
Yes. We're headed to the place
near Woomin Park, right?

324
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:28,448
Judging by the estimated arrival time,
I think we're almost there.

325
00:23:29,116 --> 00:23:30,200
Just wait a bit longer.

326
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:40,669
Take a right after 100m.

327
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:46,383
No, not there!

328
00:23:46,466 --> 00:23:47,843
Don't go there!

329
00:23:47,926 --> 00:23:49,970
Mother, what's the matter with you?

330
00:23:50,053 --> 00:23:52,472
Grandma, please stop.

331
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:56,977
Mother.

332
00:23:57,060 --> 00:23:59,104
Take me. I'll go instead.

333
00:24:00,397 --> 00:24:02,440
Don't you dare lay a finger on Ha-ni!

334
00:24:16,872 --> 00:24:18,874
I don't see any lights here.

335
00:24:19,457 --> 00:24:20,542
Is this the place?

336
00:24:23,086 --> 00:24:26,089
I'll try calling the shaman.

337
00:24:30,218 --> 00:24:31,344
Where is my cell phone?

338
00:24:32,679 --> 00:24:33,763
Oh, gosh.

339
00:24:34,598 --> 00:24:35,849
Bald Eagle was right.

340
00:24:35,932 --> 00:24:38,727
You're so clumsy just like I am.

341
00:24:40,562 --> 00:24:41,730
You can use this.

342
00:24:48,820 --> 00:24:50,071
SCARLETT

343
00:24:51,239 --> 00:24:53,200
-Old Lady.
-Yu-hyeon.

344
00:24:53,283 --> 00:24:55,827
Are you on your way to see Jobs?

345
00:24:56,536 --> 00:24:59,039
How do you know that?

346
00:24:59,122 --> 00:25:00,874
I'll explain once we meet.

347
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,002
Stop where you are and wait there.
Where are you?

348
00:25:06,213 --> 00:25:07,672
I don't know.

349
00:25:07,756 --> 00:25:12,010
Do you see any big buildings nearby?
I'll find my way there.

350
00:25:14,429 --> 00:25:17,182
I don't see anything here.

351
00:25:19,684 --> 00:25:23,980
If you check my cell phone,
you'll find a GPS location tracking app.

352
00:25:24,064 --> 00:25:25,690
It's connected to this phone,

353
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:27,525
so try searching our location.

354
00:25:28,485 --> 00:25:31,238
What? A location tracking app?

355
00:25:32,822 --> 00:25:34,699
You've been checking my whereabouts?

356
00:25:34,783 --> 00:25:36,826
I had it installed just in case.

357
00:25:37,869 --> 00:25:39,496
Moms do that kind of stuff.

358
00:25:40,705 --> 00:25:42,040
You're not even my real mom.

359
00:25:45,502 --> 00:25:47,003
A location tracking app?

360
00:25:52,842 --> 00:25:55,095
It's still checking your location.
Just a second.

361
00:25:56,554 --> 00:25:59,099
You will soon be
arriving at your destination.

362
00:25:59,182 --> 00:26:02,227
Yu-hyeon, we're apparently almost there.

363
00:26:09,317 --> 00:26:10,402
It's raining.

364
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,623
Why aren't the brakes working?

365
00:26:23,707 --> 00:26:25,583
Sir, what's the matter?

366
00:26:25,667 --> 00:26:28,420
-What's going on?
-Sir.

367
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:40,849
Old Lady.

368
00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:44,686
What's going on?

369
00:26:45,353 --> 00:26:46,354
Old Lady.

370
00:26:47,564 --> 00:26:48,606
Old Lady!

371
00:27:02,954 --> 00:27:06,666
You have arrived at your destination.
Ending navigation.

372
00:27:13,673 --> 00:27:17,135
Kung dari shabara, ba ba ba

373
00:27:17,719 --> 00:27:21,056
Everyone goes through hardships

374
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:25,310
Don't obsess too much over one thing

375
00:27:25,393 --> 00:27:29,397
When you're feeling down
Just forget about it like me

376
00:27:29,481 --> 00:27:33,151
Dad, I told you
that's not how you sing it.

377
00:27:34,611 --> 00:27:36,446
I guess you feel better now.

378
00:27:39,366 --> 00:27:40,575
-Dad.
-Yes?

379
00:27:40,658 --> 00:27:41,701
Am I heavy?

380
00:27:41,785 --> 00:27:44,829
No, you're lighter than a feather.

381
00:27:45,955 --> 00:27:47,832
How's your ankle?

382
00:27:47,916 --> 00:27:50,251
I just sprained it a little.

383
00:27:50,335 --> 00:27:52,796
I'm dancing to a Fin.K.L song
at the school festival.

384
00:27:52,879 --> 00:27:54,172
So I need to practice.

385
00:27:54,255 --> 00:27:57,467
I'll put some ice on your ankle
once we get home.

386
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:59,052
So don't overdo it for a while.

387
00:27:59,135 --> 00:28:03,306
No, I'm Hosu High School's Lee Hyo-ri.
Without me, it won't be Fin.K.L.

388
00:28:03,390 --> 00:28:05,141
Goodness.

389
00:28:05,642 --> 00:28:09,312
I got so shocked during work
that I ran over to you right away.

390
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:12,649
I exaggerated a bit
because I wanted you to come.

391
00:28:13,858 --> 00:28:15,193
Good job.

392
00:28:15,276 --> 00:28:18,279
You can call me whenever you're
having a hard time or in pain.

393
00:28:18,947 --> 00:28:22,867
I'll come faster than lighting
to save you, Ha-ni.

394
00:28:22,951 --> 00:28:23,868
Do you mean that?

395
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:27,497
Then you'd better come running
whenever I call you.

396
00:28:28,039 --> 00:28:28,998
You got it.

397
00:28:55,316 --> 00:28:56,484
Dad.

398
00:28:57,402 --> 00:28:59,362
-Dad.
-Old Lady.

399
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:03,074
Old Lady.

400
00:29:08,037 --> 00:29:10,331
-Where…
-You're at a hospital.

401
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:12,333
You fainted due to shock,

402
00:29:12,417 --> 00:29:13,835
but you're apparently fine.

403
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,463
What about the kid?

404
00:29:16,546 --> 00:29:19,507
She's okay too. Your daughter…

405
00:29:20,800 --> 00:29:21,676
I mean…

406
00:29:22,677 --> 00:29:25,805
The girl from the past is also fine.

407
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:32,061
What? How did you find out?

408
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:35,732
He told me.

409
00:29:42,071 --> 00:29:43,406
How did you come here?

410
00:29:47,702 --> 00:29:48,787
We have a problem.

411
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:50,580
"A problem"?

412
00:29:53,166 --> 00:29:56,711
The reason she came here to meet you
from 20 years ago was because

413
00:29:57,712 --> 00:30:00,048
someone desperately
wanted you guys to meet.

414
00:30:02,675 --> 00:30:04,928
Who would want that for us?

415
00:30:05,011 --> 00:30:06,554
You'll find out soon.

416
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:11,184
But because of that,
the heavens have lost balance.

417
00:30:13,186 --> 00:30:15,271
-What?
-After she came here,

418
00:30:15,772 --> 00:30:18,191
the world lost its balance.

419
00:30:28,201 --> 00:30:29,452
Then…

420
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,872
Then what do we need to do?

421
00:30:36,501 --> 00:30:39,712
The same two people aren't allowed
to exist together.

422
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:42,924
The one who doesn't belong here must go.

423
00:30:44,509 --> 00:30:45,927
Does that mean…

424
00:30:48,346 --> 00:30:49,264
she's going to die?

425
00:30:51,432 --> 00:30:53,393
Then, was yesterday's accident--

426
00:30:53,476 --> 00:30:55,353
Yes, that's right. As it started to rain,

427
00:30:55,436 --> 00:30:58,690
the shadows of death
found their way to her.

428
00:31:07,198 --> 00:31:09,993
Use this to hide her presence
as much as you can.

429
00:31:10,076 --> 00:31:11,327
This time…

430
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:14,497
I won't let this slide.

431
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:43,818
Hey, wait.

432
00:31:46,154 --> 00:31:49,282
What do we need to do
to send that little girl back?

433
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,454
How interesting.

434
00:31:55,538 --> 00:31:57,832
I thought you'd ask
if this is even possible.

435
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:00,960
Well, Old Lady was

436
00:32:02,378 --> 00:32:04,088
shaking in fear.

437
00:32:04,172 --> 00:32:06,424
That means you were telling the truth.

438
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:09,636
The fact that the girl came from the past

439
00:32:10,720 --> 00:32:12,221
and that she's in danger.

440
00:32:12,805 --> 00:32:15,558
I'll try to find a way,
so wait until I do.

441
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:19,103
What if something happens to them again?

442
00:32:20,313 --> 00:32:21,856
Then that'd be their fate.

443
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:23,149
"Fate"?

444
00:32:24,067 --> 00:32:26,277
How can you be so irresponsible?

445
00:32:26,361 --> 00:32:28,446
If that's their destiny,

446
00:32:29,822 --> 00:32:31,199
there's nothing I can do.

447
00:32:33,826 --> 00:32:34,827
Fine.

448
00:32:35,703 --> 00:32:40,124
Then I'll change that destiny or whatever.

449
00:32:54,347 --> 00:32:55,348
Goodness.

450
00:32:56,140 --> 00:32:57,934
Fate can be so amusing.

451
00:32:59,435 --> 00:33:03,481
I guess he's going to pay you back
for what he owes you.

452
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:40,226
Yu-hyeon.

453
00:33:45,523 --> 00:33:47,900
Thanks to the location tracking app
on your phone,

454
00:33:47,984 --> 00:33:49,736
I found you guys pretty quickly.

455
00:33:49,819 --> 00:33:52,196
I owe you once again.

456
00:33:54,449 --> 00:33:55,366
Thank you.

457
00:33:56,784 --> 00:33:58,327
I bet you had a hard time.

458
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:01,205
You should get some rest over the weekend.

459
00:34:02,165 --> 00:34:03,416
And as for her…

460
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,586
You should take good care of her.

461
00:34:07,253 --> 00:34:08,296
I'll be off now.

462
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,716
-By the way--
-I won't tell anyone.

463
00:34:13,217 --> 00:34:16,763
I don't think
anyone will believe me anyway.

464
00:34:40,495 --> 00:34:41,662
Hey, you're up.

465
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:45,416
Where are we?

466
00:34:45,500 --> 00:34:49,754
The hospital.
Thankfully, we weren't injured.

467
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,050
Did it stop raining?

468
00:34:55,009 --> 00:34:56,511
-Yes.
-Seriously?

469
00:34:57,929 --> 00:34:59,722
So I have to wait until it rains again?

470
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,728
I talked to the shaman over the phone.

471
00:35:06,312 --> 00:35:07,814
He told us to wait.

472
00:35:27,875 --> 00:35:29,168
I'm sorry for being late.

473
00:35:29,252 --> 00:35:32,171
There was a traffic jam nearby.

474
00:35:32,255 --> 00:35:33,422
It's all right.

475
00:35:34,215 --> 00:35:37,760
I was surprised
when you suddenly wanted to see me.

476
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:40,054
It's been ages
since we had a meal together.

477
00:35:40,138 --> 00:35:42,932
I wanted to personally congratulate you
on your pregnancy.

478
00:35:43,724 --> 00:35:44,934
Eat up.

479
00:35:45,017 --> 00:35:46,144
They look so tasty.

480
00:35:46,227 --> 00:35:48,729
Mother, have some.

481
00:35:48,813 --> 00:35:49,814
Here.

482
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,698
It's so scrumptious.

483
00:35:59,448 --> 00:36:00,992
Have some of this as well.

484
00:36:01,909 --> 00:36:04,954
I often had this during my pregnancy.

485
00:36:06,455 --> 00:36:09,000
-When you were pregnant with Do-yun?
-Exactly.

486
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:11,460
Perhaps, he didn't want me to suffer.

487
00:36:11,544 --> 00:36:13,004
I never had morning sickness.

488
00:36:13,963 --> 00:36:17,049
He was such a wonderful son
even before he was born.

489
00:36:18,676 --> 00:36:19,927
That sounds like him.

490
00:36:20,761 --> 00:36:22,805
You'll be able
to understand me eventually,

491
00:36:22,889 --> 00:36:24,849
but that's how mothers feel.

492
00:36:24,932 --> 00:36:26,684
That young kid who never left my side

493
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:29,145
turned 10 then 20.

494
00:36:29,228 --> 00:36:32,315
He's older than I was when I had him.

495
00:36:32,398 --> 00:36:34,525
And now, he's a dad.

496
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,905
Nevertheless,
he's still the apple of my eye.

497
00:36:38,988 --> 00:36:41,032
He's my precious, little boy.

498
00:36:42,366 --> 00:36:45,494
-I see.
-That's why I was so worried,

499
00:36:45,578 --> 00:36:48,998
attached, and tried to direct him
down the right path.

500
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:51,626
Because of that,

501
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,132
I think I may have been
a bit too harsh on you.

502
00:36:59,759 --> 00:37:01,427
Not at all.

503
00:37:02,970 --> 00:37:07,141
I completely understand.

504
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,269
You're such a thoughtful
and kindhearted girl.

505
00:37:10,353 --> 00:37:13,689
I should've embraced you sooner.

506
00:37:13,773 --> 00:37:16,192
You grew up lacking parental love,

507
00:37:16,275 --> 00:37:19,153
and I made you feel even lonelier,
my child.

508
00:37:24,700 --> 00:37:25,993
I'm sorry.

509
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:28,955
I'm sorry, Ji-eun.

510
00:37:31,123 --> 00:37:33,960
-Mother.
-I'm not a good enough person.

511
00:37:34,710 --> 00:37:38,965
There's not much I can do
for you guys or my grandchild.

512
00:37:40,216 --> 00:37:44,178
Don't say that. You're just fine.

513
00:37:44,262 --> 00:37:46,847
Ji-eun, to tell you the truth,

514
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,518
I have so many things
I want to do for you and Do-yun.

515
00:37:51,769 --> 00:37:55,231
To be precise,
I could even sacrifice my life for you.

516
00:37:56,315 --> 00:37:57,441
I know.

517
00:37:58,526 --> 00:38:00,528
I know how you feel.

518
00:38:06,200 --> 00:38:07,201
Right.

519
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:15,376
Why are you here on the weekend?

520
00:38:15,459 --> 00:38:17,336
I'd like to ask you the same thing.

521
00:38:17,420 --> 00:38:19,046
Why are you working today?

522
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,049
I was organizing the contest evaluations.

523
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:23,134
Sit down.

524
00:38:23,634 --> 00:38:27,138
Weren't there many great ideas?

525
00:38:28,472 --> 00:38:32,685
There were. But most of all,
Star Land was truly remarkable.

526
00:38:32,768 --> 00:38:34,562
I heard Yu-hyeon was part of it.

527
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:38,399
I thought all those certificates
and licenses were useless,

528
00:38:39,317 --> 00:38:41,944
but I guess they finally paid off.

529
00:38:43,195 --> 00:38:45,656
Then did you make him work here
on purpose?

530
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:46,741
So that he'd grow up?

531
00:38:48,451 --> 00:38:50,619
He was always gone,

532
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:54,498
so I wanted to keep him by my side
and see him whenever I wanted.

533
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:59,712
After some time,
I won't be able to see him anyway.

534
00:38:59,795 --> 00:39:01,422
Come on. Don't be ridiculous.

535
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,930
-Do-yun.
-Yes?

536
00:39:11,265 --> 00:39:15,603
The doctor said I'll be going blind soon.

537
00:39:17,646 --> 00:39:20,649
-What?
-I thought you should be the first to know

538
00:39:21,317 --> 00:39:24,528
if anything ever happened to me.

539
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:27,782
Uncle, I don't understand.

540
00:39:27,865 --> 00:39:31,827
Please keep this a secret
from your mom and Yu-hyeon

541
00:39:32,912 --> 00:39:34,205
for the time being.

542
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,798
They say there are blessings in disguise.

543
00:39:43,881 --> 00:39:47,802
I'm truly exhilarated
that we'll be having a new family member.

544
00:40:20,835 --> 00:40:23,379
If you ever find someone in trouble,

545
00:40:23,462 --> 00:40:25,589
do the same, and be their Superman.

546
00:40:25,673 --> 00:40:26,674
Okay?

547
00:40:29,510 --> 00:40:30,719
Don't worry.

548
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,849
I'll keep that promise at all costs.

549
00:40:52,783 --> 00:40:53,951
Don't tell me…

550
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:56,787
-you did this.
-What?

551
00:40:59,373 --> 00:41:01,959
Bald Eagle made our house squeaky clean.

552
00:41:02,042 --> 00:41:02,960
She was here?

553
00:41:03,043 --> 00:41:04,962
Yes. She brought some dishes and kimchi.

554
00:41:09,842 --> 00:41:10,968
What is that?

555
00:41:12,887 --> 00:41:14,305
A vacuum?

556
00:41:14,388 --> 00:41:15,890
What? It's a vacuum?

557
00:41:16,432 --> 00:41:18,726
Gosh, it looks so fascinating.

558
00:41:27,443 --> 00:41:29,778
I thought you might need one.

559
00:41:30,696 --> 00:41:33,282
Eat the kimchi and the side dishes
that are in the fridge.

560
00:41:34,241 --> 00:41:35,075
And…

561
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:40,080
thanks for allowing me
to hear Dad's voice once again.

562
00:41:42,082 --> 00:41:43,209
What's that?

563
00:41:44,919 --> 00:41:46,253
It's nothing.

564
00:41:47,254 --> 00:41:49,340
Ha-yeong bought that.

565
00:41:50,549 --> 00:41:51,467
What?

566
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:54,261
What's gotten into her?

567
00:41:55,721 --> 00:41:58,724
They say people change drastically
when they're nearing death.

568
00:41:58,807 --> 00:42:01,519
Could she be sick?

569
00:42:02,269 --> 00:42:03,270
Watch what you say.

570
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,648
Fine.

571
00:42:12,947 --> 00:42:14,240
MEDICATION INFO

572
00:42:27,878 --> 00:42:32,007
Ha-yeong, me too.
Thank you for everything.

573
00:42:32,091 --> 00:42:35,052
DANGEROUS TO TAKE WHEN PREGNANT

574
00:42:40,307 --> 00:42:41,475
Dinner's ready.

575
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:43,936
-Grandma's hungry. Let's eat.
-Okay.

576
00:42:45,062 --> 00:42:46,146
Mom.

577
00:42:46,689 --> 00:42:49,733
Are you sure those were
the anti-depressants Ha-ni took back then?

578
00:42:49,817 --> 00:42:52,403
Yes. What is this about?

579
00:42:54,196 --> 00:42:55,197
Never mind.

580
00:42:56,657 --> 00:42:59,410
I have some work left.
You two can eat first.

581
00:42:59,493 --> 00:43:01,870
Okay, then.

582
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:09,878
She's definitely not Ha-ni's daughter.

583
00:43:14,258 --> 00:43:17,428
Then who is she?

584
00:43:29,607 --> 00:43:31,275
What's with the talisman?

585
00:43:32,067 --> 00:43:33,027
Well…

586
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:38,741
It's supposed to bring in good luck.

587
00:43:39,575 --> 00:43:41,660
Hey, you blinked twice.

588
00:43:41,744 --> 00:43:43,454
You're not fooling me.

589
00:43:44,538 --> 00:43:45,831
What's that for?

590
00:43:46,874 --> 00:43:50,127
Don't tell me you're trying
to paralyze me like a jiangshi.

591
00:43:50,210 --> 00:43:52,379
What? A jiangshi?

592
00:43:54,715 --> 00:43:55,883
Don't you remember this?

593
00:43:56,884 --> 00:43:58,802
Dad used to watch the movie every night.

594
00:44:00,012 --> 00:44:01,805
Right. I remember now.

595
00:44:01,889 --> 00:44:03,724
I wish there was a talisman for that.

596
00:44:03,807 --> 00:44:06,185
Then I'd stick it on your forehead

597
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:08,395
and lock you up in this house.

598
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:11,774
Why? In case I'd cause trouble again?

599
00:44:11,857 --> 00:44:14,234
No. I'm just worried.

600
00:44:17,655 --> 00:44:19,907
Who could that be at this hour?

601
00:44:20,866 --> 00:44:21,909
Hey, old lady.

602
00:44:26,455 --> 00:44:27,915
Why are you here?

603
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,042
Why did you leave the hospital so soon?

604
00:44:30,125 --> 00:44:32,878
Car accidents could cause
some serious aftereffects.

605
00:44:32,961 --> 00:44:35,047
As you can see, I'm fine.

606
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,507
I appreciate your concern.

607
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:40,052
-Did you have dinner?
-We were just about to.

608
00:44:40,135 --> 00:44:42,471
I made this in a haste. Have it.

609
00:44:43,597 --> 00:44:45,766
-What is this?
-Porridge.

610
00:44:46,642 --> 00:44:49,019
-You didn't have to.
-And you.

611
00:44:49,103 --> 00:44:50,145
Yes?

612
00:44:50,688 --> 00:44:51,772
Listen to your mom.

613
00:44:53,148 --> 00:44:55,484
Don't wander around
without her permission.

614
00:44:58,862 --> 00:45:00,072
Here.

615
00:45:01,907 --> 00:45:02,991
Bye.

616
00:45:12,876 --> 00:45:15,170
Call me if you want to go somewhere.

617
00:45:15,254 --> 00:45:16,547
Don't worry her.

618
00:45:16,630 --> 00:45:18,757
What? What is this about?

619
00:45:20,092 --> 00:45:21,844
Why would he give me this?

620
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,808
-I'll be back.
-What? Where are you going?

621
00:45:28,475 --> 00:45:29,435
Stay here.

622
00:45:29,935 --> 00:45:31,603
Where are you going?

623
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:37,443
-Wait.
-What?

624
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,529
What is it? Is something wrong?

625
00:45:42,364 --> 00:45:44,700
Thank you. I truly mean it.

626
00:45:44,783 --> 00:45:46,326
For what this time?

627
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:49,121
Just everything.

628
00:45:54,126 --> 00:45:56,462
I'll get going then.
Go have some porridge.

629
00:45:56,545 --> 00:45:57,796
It'll get cold.

630
00:45:59,465 --> 00:46:00,340
Bye.

631
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:28,410
Hurry up.

632
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:33,290
I can't believe he made this for us.

633
00:46:35,459 --> 00:46:37,920
He was the one who saved us
from that accident.

634
00:46:38,003 --> 00:46:39,922
-Really?
-Yes.

635
00:46:41,548 --> 00:46:42,966
So that's why he said that.

636
00:46:43,050 --> 00:46:44,259
And…

637
00:46:45,719 --> 00:46:48,055
-he knows everything now.
-About what?

638
00:46:49,181 --> 00:46:51,517
That you're me.

639
00:46:51,600 --> 00:46:54,061
What? Really?

640
00:46:56,271 --> 00:46:59,525
So you can be yourself in front of him.

641
00:47:01,485 --> 00:47:02,611
Let's eat.

642
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:04,696
Okay.

643
00:47:05,531 --> 00:47:07,241
What's this? It's vegetable porridge.

644
00:47:07,324 --> 00:47:09,159
Thank you for the meal.

645
00:47:12,412 --> 00:47:13,413
Not bad.

646
00:47:16,291 --> 00:47:21,004
Thanks to him, I now have the courage
to protect you.

647
00:47:22,214 --> 00:47:27,094
We have someone on our side
who believes in us.

648
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:34,434
These days, Yu-hyeon is…

649
00:47:37,521 --> 00:47:39,356
Mr. Han looks happy these days.

650
00:47:40,357 --> 00:47:43,443
I was wondering why he stayed around
for so long this time.

651
00:47:45,028 --> 00:47:46,196
So, why is it?

652
00:47:46,280 --> 00:47:49,533
I believe it's because of Ms. Bahn Ha-ni.

653
00:47:50,284 --> 00:47:51,577
"Bahn Ha-ni"?

654
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:54,496
He has changed a lot while preparing
for the contest with her.

655
00:47:55,163 --> 00:47:57,124
He looked ambitious and enthusiastic.

656
00:47:57,958 --> 00:48:00,252
He seemed motivated to win.

657
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:09,386
Ms. Bahn.

658
00:48:09,469 --> 00:48:11,555
-Yes?
-Have you finished organizing

659
00:48:11,638 --> 00:48:12,848
the surveys we took?

660
00:48:12,931 --> 00:48:15,225
I already sent them to you.

661
00:48:15,309 --> 00:48:18,270
-Here it is.
-I'm looking at it right now.

662
00:48:19,396 --> 00:48:23,942
Gosh. Ms. Bahn, how could you do
something like this?

663
00:48:25,319 --> 00:48:26,153
It's perfect.

664
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:28,822
It's impeccable.

665
00:48:29,406 --> 00:48:30,365
Thank you.

666
00:48:30,449 --> 00:48:32,492
-Thank you.
-You're too outstanding.

667
00:48:32,576 --> 00:48:37,080
Ms. Bahn, could you look over
this design draft for me?

668
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:39,207
I don't know much about designs.

669
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,044
Don't be humble.

670
00:48:42,127 --> 00:48:45,631
Your recent presentation was outstanding.

671
00:48:45,714 --> 00:48:47,507
-Was it?
-Come on over here.

672
00:48:48,008 --> 00:48:49,468
Here.

673
00:48:49,551 --> 00:48:52,054
How about changing the color?

674
00:48:52,137 --> 00:48:53,805
For honey butter and this one.

675
00:48:53,889 --> 00:48:57,017
Gosh, you're awesome.

676
00:48:58,560 --> 00:48:59,561
Like this?

677
00:49:05,525 --> 00:49:06,610
Hello, Mother.

678
00:49:12,491 --> 00:49:14,785
You want me to do what?

679
00:49:14,868 --> 00:49:17,162
Didn't you say you understood me?

680
00:49:18,121 --> 00:49:20,499
You said you'd do anything for our family.

681
00:49:21,792 --> 00:49:22,793
Well…

682
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:27,172
I did say that, but this is--

683
00:49:27,255 --> 00:49:30,050
Back when my father was alive,

684
00:49:32,260 --> 00:49:35,222
I was more competent than my brother,

685
00:49:35,305 --> 00:49:38,558
but I had to remain in his shadow
because I was a woman.

686
00:49:38,642 --> 00:49:42,062
In the end, Do-yun met the same fate
as mine.

687
00:49:42,729 --> 00:49:45,023
That's why I'm planning

688
00:49:45,857 --> 00:49:48,151
to take back everything I've lost.

689
00:49:48,819 --> 00:49:50,237
At least for our family's sake.

690
00:49:57,828 --> 00:50:01,331
By "our family", do you mean--

691
00:50:01,415 --> 00:50:04,167
Do-yun, you, and…

692
00:50:08,255 --> 00:50:10,090
my one and only grandchild.

693
00:50:12,092 --> 00:50:14,469
You don't need anyone else, do you?

694
00:50:19,141 --> 00:50:20,016
Come in.

695
00:50:32,195 --> 00:50:33,155

697
00:50:43,457 --> 00:50:44,958
It's okay.

698
00:50:45,625 --> 00:50:49,004

Set it to something you'll never forget.

713
00:52:15,924 --> 00:52:17,676
Then I'll use this.

00:53:10,478 --> 00:53:11,730
MY FRIEND SO-HYE

719
00:53:14,149 --> 00:53:15,942
Hey, So-hye.

720
00:53:16,026 --> 00:53:18,570
Why did you call me
so early in the morning?

721
00:53:21,448 --> 00:53:22,449
What?

722
00:53:24,910 --> 00:53:26,912
What? Really?

723
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:29,748
Okay.

724
00:53:30,248 --> 00:53:32,709
I'll call you back later. Bye.

725
00:53:33,293 --> 00:53:34,586
So-hye? What is it?

726
00:53:34,669 --> 00:53:37,756
Today's her school anniversary,
so there's no class.

727
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,174
She wants to hang out.

728
00:53:39,257 --> 00:53:41,551
Where do you think you're going?

729
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,762
I told you to stay home
for the time being.

730
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:47,140
I was going to invite her over
since it's cold outside anyway.

731
00:53:48,934 --> 00:53:49,809
Really?

732
00:53:51,478 --> 00:53:54,731
Then you should clean up before she comes.

733
00:53:55,607 --> 00:53:58,276
I can't be bothered to.

734
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:01,321
I don't even clean my own room.
Don't be ridiculous.

735
00:54:02,447 --> 00:54:03,698
Just sleep.

736
00:54:04,950 --> 00:54:06,159
I'll do it for you.

737
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:24,761
I'm done cleaning.

738
00:54:27,847 --> 00:54:29,307
I'm off to work now.

739
00:54:29,891 --> 00:54:31,559
Don't create a mess.

740
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:33,478
Have a proper meal, not just snacks.

741
00:54:33,561 --> 00:54:36,815
And most of all, be careful what you say
in front of her.

742
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:39,609
I got it. Gosh.

743
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,654
You're an even bigger nagger than Mom.

744
00:54:42,737 --> 00:54:46,032
Hey, let's be honest. She's much worse.

745
00:54:46,116 --> 00:54:48,660
She was the biggest nagger in the world.

746
00:54:48,743 --> 00:54:53,164
You're right.
Even if I was the slightest bit late,

747
00:54:53,248 --> 00:54:55,583
she'd blow up my phone.

748
00:54:56,418 --> 00:54:59,921
If I could've screened my calls like now,
I wouldn't have picked up.

749
00:55:00,714 --> 00:55:02,090
You're right.

750
00:55:02,173 --> 00:55:03,008
Oh, right.

751
00:55:03,800 --> 00:55:06,886
I got a call a few days ago.

752
00:55:06,970 --> 00:55:08,972
-A call?
-On that phone.

753
00:55:09,055 --> 00:55:11,349
It suddenly rang out of the blue.

754
00:55:13,977 --> 00:55:15,895
Don't be absurd.

755
00:55:15,979 --> 00:55:18,690
This doesn't even work here.

756
00:55:20,066 --> 00:55:22,152
I'm telling you.

757
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:26,740
From who?

758
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:29,075
I don't know that.

759
00:55:29,784 --> 00:55:31,786
They hung up before I could pick up.

760
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:37,292
You must answer the phone.

761
00:55:37,375 --> 00:55:40,295
No matter what, you must answer that call.

762
00:55:41,921 --> 00:55:44,674
Right. Grandma told me to answer it
at all costs.

763
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,010
"Grandma"?

764
00:55:49,929 --> 00:55:52,432
Someone called that old phone?

765
00:55:52,932 --> 00:55:55,685
Yes. Apparently, our grandma had told her

766
00:55:55,769 --> 00:55:58,480
that she had to pick it up
if she wanted to live.

767
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,940
Since she has dementia,

768
00:56:01,024 --> 00:56:03,902
it may have just sounded
like she was rambling.

769
00:56:03,985 --> 00:56:06,988
But since she said someone had called her,

770
00:56:07,072 --> 00:56:08,656
it keeps bothering me.

771
00:56:10,241 --> 00:56:11,826
Let's wait for now.

772
00:56:11,910 --> 00:56:15,580
Whether it be through that phone or
the shaman, we'll find a way to save her.

773
00:56:18,249 --> 00:56:19,667
Thank you.

774
00:56:19,751 --> 00:56:21,586
-For what?
-Just because.

775
00:56:22,796 --> 00:56:26,299
I'm grateful I have someone to confide in.

776
00:56:35,975 --> 00:56:36,810
Ha-ni.

777
00:56:37,393 --> 00:56:38,269
Anthony.

778
00:56:38,353 --> 00:56:41,815
I hardly recognized you
because you looked so beautiful.

779
00:56:42,315 --> 00:56:43,316
Why are you here?

780
00:56:43,399 --> 00:56:46,152
I had work nearby,
so I was just passing by.

781
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:48,738
I saw you but didn't know
if it was really you or not.

782
00:56:48,822 --> 00:56:51,116
So I came to check. It really is you.

783
00:56:51,199 --> 00:56:54,869
If you were passing by,
just go about your day.

784
00:56:54,953 --> 00:56:57,497
Don't honk your horn at us
and cause a commotion.

785
00:56:58,998 --> 00:57:00,542
Are you going to work?

786
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,627
Get in. I'll drop you off.

787
00:57:02,710 --> 00:57:04,170
I thought you had work.

788
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:06,256
I can just take the bus.

789
00:57:06,339 --> 00:57:07,715
No, I have no work.

790
00:57:08,883 --> 00:57:12,053
Actually, I do. But it's not that urgent.

791
00:57:12,887 --> 00:57:15,723
Then let's hop in since it's cold.

792
00:57:22,856 --> 00:57:23,857
Hey.

793
00:57:26,234 --> 00:57:29,279
-Why are you here?
-Just get going.

794
00:57:30,196 --> 00:57:31,573
Thanks for the ride.

795
00:57:32,782 --> 00:57:34,200
Let me turn the seat heater on.

796
00:57:47,422 --> 00:57:49,966
Thanks for the ride, Anthony.

797
00:57:50,049 --> 00:57:52,927
No, it was my pleasure.
What time will you get off work today?

798
00:57:53,595 --> 00:57:55,054
-Why?
-Because…

799
00:57:56,097 --> 00:58:00,727
I'll be coming back here for work
around the time you clock out.

800
00:58:00,810 --> 00:58:02,145
I get off at 6 p.m.

801
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:04,898
I never asked you.

802
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:06,566
We're neighbors anyway.

803
00:58:06,649 --> 00:58:08,193
I could tag along.

804
00:58:08,276 --> 00:58:09,819
I'm late. I should get going.

805
00:58:09,903 --> 00:58:11,321
Okay. Get there safe.

806
00:58:11,404 --> 00:58:13,406
-Drive safely.
-Okay. Don't forget your meals.

807
00:58:13,490 --> 00:58:14,699
Wait up.

808
00:58:16,409 --> 00:58:17,869
You better watch out.

809
00:58:18,786 --> 00:58:19,871
When driving, that is.

810
00:58:22,999 --> 00:58:25,210
How can I get him away from her?

811
00:58:25,293 --> 00:58:27,003
JOA CONFECTIONERY

812
00:58:27,086 --> 00:58:28,713
-Hello.

813
00:58:28,796 --> 00:58:30,548
-Hello.
-Hello.

814
00:58:38,139 --> 00:58:39,057
Two, three.

815
00:58:39,140 --> 00:58:41,476
-Happy victory to you

00:58:41,559 --> 00:58:44,103
-Happy victory to you
-Happy victory to you

817
00:58:44,187 --> 00:58:48,608
-Happy victory, dear Ms. Bahn
-Happy victory, dear Ms. Bahn

818
00:58:51,236 --> 00:58:53,404
Wait. What is this about?

819
00:58:53,905 --> 00:58:55,406
I knew you were one of a kind,

820
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:57,867
but you definitely exceeded
my expectations!

821
00:58:57,951 --> 00:59:01,663
You won the in-house contest.

822
00:59:02,330 --> 00:59:05,124
-I did?
-It was announced online this morning.

823
00:59:05,208 --> 00:59:06,501
I'm so jealous!

824
00:59:07,293 --> 00:59:09,546
-That was too short. Let's sing again.
-Okay.

825
00:59:09,629 --> 00:59:11,756
-Happy victory to you
-Happy victory to you

826
00:59:11,839 --> 00:59:13,883
-Happy victory to you
-Happy victory to you

827
00:59:13,967 --> 00:59:18,346
-Happy victory, dear Ms. Bahn
-Happy victory, dear Ms. Bahn

828
00:59:19,138 --> 00:59:21,599
-Congratulations!
-Congratulations!

829
00:59:28,648 --> 00:59:30,024
-Thank you.
-Let's eat.

830
00:59:30,108 --> 00:59:31,234
-Okay.
-It looks tasty.

831
00:59:31,317 --> 00:59:32,485
Let's have a taste.

832
00:59:33,736 --> 00:59:34,988
-Goodness.
-I'm so jealous.

833
00:59:35,947 --> 00:59:37,156
Who are you?

834
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,242
We're from the Inspection Division.

835
00:59:39,325 --> 00:59:40,952
-"Inspection"?
-"Inspection"?

836
00:59:41,035 --> 00:59:42,620
But why?

837
00:59:42,704 --> 00:59:45,415
Ms. Bahn, we need to talk.

838
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:50,920
-Excuse me.
-What is this about?

839
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:53,172
Mr. Han Yu-hyeon?

840
00:59:53,798 --> 00:59:54,799
Yes? Who are you?

841
00:59:54,882 --> 00:59:57,594
We're from the Inspection Division.
Please come with us.

842
01:00:00,054 --> 01:00:02,390
What? Why do I need to go with you?

843
01:00:03,641 --> 01:00:06,769
-But…
-At least tell us what this is about.

844
01:00:06,853 --> 01:00:09,439
We received a tip-off
that she had plagiarized her idea

845
01:00:09,522 --> 01:00:11,149
for the in-house contest.

846
01:00:12,817 --> 01:00:14,152
You and Ms. Bahn

847
01:00:14,235 --> 01:00:16,821
are being investigated for plagiarizing
for the in-house contest.

848
01:00:16,904 --> 01:00:18,281
"Plagiarizing"?

849
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:58,196
If word gets out that you copied
the work of our rival company,

850
01:00:58,279 --> 01:01:00,281
do you think you can manage that alone?

851
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:01,491
Don't you know this song either?

852
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,826
It's as if you've come here from the past.

853
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,453
I will accept this cook-off.

854
01:01:05,536 --> 01:01:07,246
It's not like you to be this nervous.

855
01:01:07,330 --> 01:01:10,583
I went through hoops
to get this far in my career, you know.

856
01:01:10,667 --> 01:01:12,460
Did you just hang up on me?

857
01:01:12,543 --> 01:01:16,756
I thought I'd be an amazing person
when I grew up.

858
01:01:16,839 --> 01:01:18,675
Cheer up.

859
01:01:18,758 --> 01:01:20,301
I told her not to go anywhere.

860
01:01:20,385 --> 01:01:22,679
Ha-ni. Bahn Ha-ni!
