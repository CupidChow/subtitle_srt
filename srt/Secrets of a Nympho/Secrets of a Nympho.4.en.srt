1
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:16,975
Is this what you want?

2
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,007
She wanted to have sex with us.

3
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:27,485
Do you think...

4
00:00:28,570 --> 00:00:30,739
she had a reason to do that to you?

5
00:00:31,051 --> 00:00:32,553
Yup.

6
00:00:32,578 --> 00:00:34,497
Money.

7
00:00:37,245 --> 00:00:38,621
Trust me.

8
00:00:38,646 --> 00:00:41,858
The same way Brian
trusted me to keep you safe.

9
00:00:42,791 --> 00:00:45,419
Let me deal with Marion.

10
00:00:47,257 --> 00:00:48,842
He is my friend.

11
00:00:48,867 --> 00:00:52,788
I can get the truth out of
him quicker than you can.

12
00:01:03,563 --> 00:01:07,942
Cheers motherfuckers!
Cheers!

13
00:01:07,942 --> 00:01:09,444
Take it easy man!

14
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:11,636
You're so intense.

15
00:01:12,184 --> 00:01:14,352
Is he on crack again?

16
00:01:15,622 --> 00:01:17,249
Not yet,

17
00:01:17,535 --> 00:01:19,913
- unless, you want some?
- Hey!

18
00:01:20,318 --> 00:01:21,820
Let's not do that.

19
00:01:21,845 --> 00:01:23,430
Let's just drink.

20
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:25,043
Come on, Bri.

21
00:01:25,068 --> 00:01:27,487
You know beer doesn't do anything for me.

22
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,422
Okay okay.

23
00:01:29,422 --> 00:01:30,840
But I'm driving you home, okay?

24
00:01:30,865 --> 00:01:33,993
My driver can take yours instead.

25
00:01:34,469 --> 00:01:37,222
- Yes dad.
- Thanks dad.

26
00:01:37,247 --> 00:01:38,556
But,

27
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,809
if you guys wanna partake...

28
00:01:41,574 --> 00:01:42,889
Nope.

29
00:01:43,035 --> 00:01:45,330
- I've got enough for everyone!
- Such a jerk.

30
00:01:45,355 --> 00:01:47,273
- You're embarrassing us!
- Not here man, damn.

31
00:01:47,315 --> 00:01:48,650
It's our party, isn't it?

32
00:01:48,691 --> 00:01:51,903
- So awkward.
- Me, I wanna partake.

33
00:01:51,928 --> 00:01:52,957
Oops.

34
00:02:09,032 --> 00:02:11,451
You look like you've been intoxicated
by something else.

35
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:14,467
Wait, hold up.

36
00:02:15,259 --> 00:02:18,763
I thought you were going to party?

37
00:02:19,834 --> 00:02:21,919
Better safe than sorry.

38
00:02:25,978 --> 00:02:27,104
Besides,

39
00:02:27,646 --> 00:02:29,732
I've been there, and I've done that.

40
00:02:30,722 --> 00:02:31,883
That one right there?

41
00:02:33,235 --> 00:02:35,362
That one I haven't done.

42
00:02:37,907 --> 00:02:39,366
The question is,

43
00:02:39,366 --> 00:02:42,953
which one of you is she looking at?

44
00:02:44,522 --> 00:02:45,542
You know what,

45
00:02:46,082 --> 00:02:47,708
I'm happy for you dude.

46
00:02:47,708 --> 00:02:50,753
This is the first time I've seen
you this happy, so go ahead.

47
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,506
- Hands off, this is yours. Good luck, man.
- How generous.

48
00:02:53,506 --> 00:02:55,508
So selfless.

49
00:02:55,863 --> 00:02:57,823
I don't need your blessing bro.

50
00:02:58,094 --> 00:03:00,638
- There you go.
- My man!

51
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,369
How you doin'?

52
00:03:18,916 --> 00:03:22,118
So you're the player of the group?

53
00:03:22,493 --> 00:03:24,995
Me? Nah.

54
00:03:25,871 --> 00:03:28,791
I'm just the fun guy
trying to know your name.

55
00:03:29,625 --> 00:03:30,918
But if you're game,

56
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:32,795
I'm willing to play.

57
00:03:34,255 --> 00:03:36,340
I'm Marion by the way.

58
00:03:36,882 --> 00:03:38,342
Well, no.

59
00:03:38,342 --> 00:03:40,302
I'm just here for a drink.

60
00:03:40,327 --> 00:03:41,870
I'll join you then.

61
00:03:42,135 --> 00:03:43,845
Are you a transferee?

62
00:03:44,332 --> 00:03:46,459
I don't think I've seen you last year.

63
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:52,273
You know,

64
00:03:52,648 --> 00:03:55,526
you should stop wasting both of our time.

65
00:03:56,983 --> 00:03:59,502
I suggest you go back to your friends.

66
00:04:02,908 --> 00:04:03,951
Bye Marion.

67
00:04:51,081 --> 00:04:52,374
Dude.

68
00:04:52,750 --> 00:04:54,877
Emerson was right.

69
00:04:55,211 --> 00:04:57,880
She was eyeing Brian the whole time.

70
00:05:13,479 --> 00:05:14,722
Dude!

71
00:05:17,107 --> 00:05:20,819
Hannah Andal, incoming sophomore
at Potenciana University.

72
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,905
You want her number? Here.

73
00:05:23,489 --> 00:05:25,407
I don't get you, man.

74
00:05:25,432 --> 00:05:27,159
I called dibs.

75
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:30,913
- Why did you hit on her?
- Easy! Come on!

76
00:05:30,938 --> 00:05:34,058
I just wanted to do you a solid, dude.

77
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,855
- I'm your wingman, dude.
- I don't need your fucking help.

78
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:39,838
Okay.

79
00:05:41,361 --> 00:05:42,905
You know what?

80
00:05:44,083 --> 00:05:45,324
I'm good.

81
00:05:46,173 --> 00:05:47,591
Hannah's all yours.

82
00:05:47,616 --> 00:05:49,493
I have my own party with Molly.

83
00:05:50,539 --> 00:05:51,762
I'm out.

84
00:10:21,119 --> 00:10:22,871
I love you Hannah.

85
00:10:41,142 --> 00:10:42,432
Are you okay?

86
00:10:44,562 --> 00:10:45,900
I'm fine.

87
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:52,188
These Valiums have been paid, alright.

88
00:10:57,656 --> 00:10:59,228
If you...

89
00:11:00,695 --> 00:11:03,111
need someone to spend the night with,

90
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:05,830
I can stay here.

91
00:11:06,790 --> 00:11:08,353
You don't have to be alone.

92
00:11:10,508 --> 00:11:11,971
I'm okay.

93
00:11:12,882 --> 00:11:15,468
I have my own demons.

94
00:11:15,977 --> 00:11:18,915
I don't need one more to keep me company.

95
00:11:26,184 --> 00:11:28,572
Why won't you give me a chance?

96
00:11:30,272 --> 00:11:34,033
Hannah, I've never felt anything
like this for anyone before.

97
00:11:34,643 --> 00:11:37,730
You deserve better
than how Brian treats you.

98
00:11:38,655 --> 00:11:40,324
You deserve someone who

99
00:11:40,725 --> 00:11:42,634
prioritizes you.

100
00:11:44,578 --> 00:11:47,111
I can also give you everything he can.

101
00:11:47,995 --> 00:11:49,497
I promise,

102
00:11:49,916 --> 00:11:51,668
when I get my winnings,

103
00:11:51,693 --> 00:11:53,392
I'll take you out on a trip.

104
00:11:54,401 --> 00:11:58,280
Out of town, out of the country,
anything. Anything you want.

105
00:11:58,892 --> 00:12:00,063
Come on.

106
00:12:04,222 --> 00:12:09,103
You asked me once, about
what Brian has that you don't.

107
00:12:10,103 --> 00:12:12,314
Brian isn't insecure.

108
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:15,900
He's not annoying, and
he's definitely not desperate.

109
00:12:28,521 --> 00:12:29,837
Hello Bri?

110
00:12:31,500 --> 00:12:33,986
I told you, I'm not busy tonight.

111
00:12:35,064 --> 00:12:36,815
I'm at home.

112
00:12:39,341 --> 00:12:40,635
See you later.

113
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:01,415
Hey! You're too loud!

114
00:14:01,676 --> 00:14:03,970
Why shouldn't I be? I'm happy.

115
00:14:04,134 --> 00:14:08,299
You're happy. Why can't
we tell the world we're happy?

116
00:14:10,056 --> 00:14:14,049
It's been a week since I've
cleared things up with Hannah so...

117
00:14:16,062 --> 00:14:17,111
Exactly.

118
00:14:18,315 --> 00:14:19,783
It's only been a week Brian.

119
00:14:21,151 --> 00:14:24,400
I don't want people to think
that I stole you from her.

120
00:14:26,336 --> 00:14:29,297
What are your friends
and family going to say?

121
00:14:29,451 --> 00:14:31,244
I'm sure when they find out,

122
00:14:31,583 --> 00:14:33,275
things will only get complicated.

123
00:14:35,131 --> 00:14:36,454
We're good, aren't we?

124
00:14:37,918 --> 00:14:39,541
Just the two of us.

125
00:14:41,254 --> 00:14:43,721
In our own perfect, little world.

126
00:14:45,131 --> 00:14:46,572
We're happy, aren't we?

127
00:14:47,636 --> 00:14:50,197
Yes. I understand.

128
00:14:52,057 --> 00:14:54,104
But I have a correction to make.

129
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:57,797
You didn't steal me from her.

130
00:14:58,438 --> 00:15:00,633
I've always been yours.

131
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:04,178
Are we clear about that?

132
00:15:06,863 --> 00:15:08,782
Okay.

133
00:15:23,880 --> 00:15:25,306
Vaping isn't allowed here.

134
00:15:25,853 --> 00:15:27,239
- Yes, ma'am.
- It was him, ma'am.

135
00:15:27,264 --> 00:15:28,768
- Asshole.
- That was yours.

136
00:15:31,974 --> 00:15:33,174
Anyway,

137
00:15:34,057 --> 00:15:37,545
My teammates told me Marion
doesn't take bets anymore.

138
00:15:38,662 --> 00:15:40,831
I think he has a new business venture.

139
00:15:40,856 --> 00:15:42,983
Well he needs it.

140
00:15:43,008 --> 00:15:45,777
He gave Brian's bookie a
huge down payment, didn't he?

141
00:15:45,802 --> 00:15:47,799
He'll be dead if he doesn't cover it.

142
00:15:51,241 --> 00:15:53,072
Are you going through something?

143
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:57,690
That's bad vibes, bro.

144
00:15:58,874 --> 00:16:00,943
If I wanted a serious conversation,

145
00:16:01,626 --> 00:16:03,529
I would have invited Brian.

146
00:16:05,088 --> 00:16:06,172
Chill, man.

147
00:16:06,197 --> 00:16:08,658
Let's just drink. On me.

148
00:16:12,433 --> 00:16:14,509
Marion, what the fuck man?

149
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:17,502
Why would you gamble 500,000?

150
00:16:19,285 --> 00:16:20,620
It's a sure win.

151
00:16:20,645 --> 00:16:23,356
Sure win? We just lost!

152
00:16:24,065 --> 00:16:27,861
We lost all our savings.
Didn't we talk about this?

153
00:16:28,361 --> 00:16:29,555
Bri, that's enough.

154
00:16:31,631 --> 00:16:33,717
We only take 10%,

155
00:16:33,742 --> 00:16:37,078
10% of our share!

156
00:16:37,103 --> 00:16:39,353
We don't gamble.

157
00:16:40,314 --> 00:16:43,314
That was our deal. How can I trust you now?

158
00:16:43,810 --> 00:16:45,311
I'm sorry, Bri.

159
00:16:45,645 --> 00:16:47,480
- Sorry.
- Wow sorry.

160
00:16:47,505 --> 00:16:49,549
I analyzed the bet.

161
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:53,272
- It was supposed to be a sure win.
- Fuck this, man!

162
00:16:55,698 --> 00:16:57,157
I'll cover my share.

163
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,986
But you take care of your fucking debt.

164
00:17:03,277 --> 00:17:05,713
Seriously? Their fight was that intense?

165
00:17:06,391 --> 00:17:07,853
Extremely intense.

166
00:17:09,736 --> 00:17:11,655
Fuck you, Bri.

167
00:17:11,853 --> 00:17:13,807
Pompous ass.

168
00:17:16,980 --> 00:17:19,357
I'll fucking kill you.

169
00:17:20,580 --> 00:17:24,250
- Bro easy.
- I'll fucking slap you with your money.

170
00:17:24,275 --> 00:17:27,612
What the fuck, seriously? Marion said that?

171
00:17:27,879 --> 00:17:29,506
But...

172
00:17:30,006 --> 00:17:32,884
do you really think he could be involved
with Brian's incident?

173
00:17:33,049 --> 00:17:35,051
I honestly don't know bro.

174
00:17:35,319 --> 00:17:37,822
That's why I'm keeping this from Gab.

175
00:17:37,847 --> 00:17:40,016
I don't want her near Marion.

176
00:17:40,926 --> 00:17:43,011
And given his mental state, bro.

177
00:17:43,036 --> 00:17:45,140
We don't know what he's capable of.

178
00:17:49,587 --> 00:17:52,170
Let me know if you need anything.
Keep me posted, okay?

179
00:17:52,195 --> 00:17:53,951
I need to know everything that's going on.

180
00:17:54,070 --> 00:17:56,656
And about Hanna's files in her cloud,

181
00:17:57,375 --> 00:17:58,835
Leave it up to me.

182
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:00,320
I got it.

183
00:18:00,783 --> 00:18:02,201
Bro.

184
00:18:02,533 --> 00:18:05,568
About you and coach Saenz,

185
00:18:06,531 --> 00:18:07,769
I wish,

186
00:18:07,794 --> 00:18:12,163
you had told me sooner so
I could have helped you too.

187
00:18:14,217 --> 00:18:16,011
I'm really sorry bro.

188
00:18:16,469 --> 00:18:18,471
It's not that I didn't trust you.

189
00:18:19,697 --> 00:18:22,158
It's just difficult to...

190
00:18:22,183 --> 00:18:26,568
open up those kinds of
things. I mean, we're close.

191
00:18:27,686 --> 00:18:30,646
But... okay take Brian for example.

192
00:18:31,484 --> 00:18:35,097
I tried to talk to him,
but it was really hard for me.

193
00:18:36,531 --> 00:18:38,533
But I had to.

194
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:41,786
It was weighing me down so I had to.

195
00:18:41,953 --> 00:18:43,872
I wanted one of my friends to know.

196
00:18:44,956 --> 00:18:48,326
Well, bro we all had secrets.

197
00:18:49,366 --> 00:18:51,619
But from now on,

198
00:18:51,644 --> 00:18:53,396
in honor of Brian,

199
00:18:54,346 --> 00:18:56,765
- no more secrets, alright?
- I promise.

200
00:18:56,801 --> 00:18:58,529
You and I,

201
00:18:59,304 --> 00:19:00,874
- we're good right?
- Of course we are.

202
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:11,566
Dad?

203
00:19:12,525 --> 00:19:14,652
What are you doing here?

204
00:19:15,111 --> 00:19:17,447
You're not responding
to any of my messages.

205
00:19:17,781 --> 00:19:19,859
And you're not answering my calls either.

206
00:19:20,434 --> 00:19:23,491
I was busy, sorry.

207
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:26,375
You're busy with your podcast, right?

208
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:28,360
It's always about the podcast.

209
00:19:32,879 --> 00:19:34,672
Dad, please.

210
00:19:35,190 --> 00:19:36,775
If you're going to lecture me,

211
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:38,760
can you do it at home and not here?

212
00:19:39,609 --> 00:19:41,702
And if you're following my podcast,

213
00:19:42,555 --> 00:19:45,335
then you know I haven't done anything new,

214
00:19:46,074 --> 00:19:48,061
since we last talked.

215
00:19:49,437 --> 00:19:52,164
Does that mean you're done with it?

216
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:55,452
No.

217
00:19:56,444 --> 00:19:58,164
I'm just getting my facts straight.

218
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:01,248
Because like you said,

219
00:20:01,273 --> 00:20:03,234
in case I get into trouble
with certain people,

220
00:20:03,939 --> 00:20:06,609
they won't have anything on me.

221
00:20:07,223 --> 00:20:09,233
Because I only tell the truth.

222
00:20:12,405 --> 00:20:14,366
If you're evidence is real,

223
00:20:14,838 --> 00:20:16,923
then why can't we go to the police?

224
00:20:17,085 --> 00:20:19,379
Let's tell them everything you know.

225
00:20:21,469 --> 00:20:22,843
So we can end this.

226
00:20:23,631 --> 00:20:24,883
Come on.

227
00:20:25,184 --> 00:20:26,226
Let's go.

228
00:20:31,050 --> 00:20:32,593
I'm guessing,

229
00:20:32,618 --> 00:20:34,320
you have nothing.

230
00:20:39,821 --> 00:20:41,492
So let it go.

231
00:20:46,570 --> 00:20:47,695
Gab,

232
00:20:48,590 --> 00:20:50,030
Believe me or not,

233
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:53,453
I respect your hard work.

234
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:58,429
I don't want to ruin it.

235
00:21:00,688 --> 00:21:02,180
I don't want to bother you.

236
00:21:03,928 --> 00:21:07,570
I can go to your school
and spill your secrets.

237
00:21:09,118 --> 00:21:10,804
Be mad at me all you want,

238
00:21:11,811 --> 00:21:14,695
but I just want to make sure you're safe.

239
00:21:15,648 --> 00:21:17,718
If you do that,

240
00:21:18,837 --> 00:21:20,733
then forget about having a daughter.

241
00:21:29,895 --> 00:21:31,367
Marion Valles!

242
00:21:33,012 --> 00:21:34,514
And who the fuck are you?

243
00:21:34,834 --> 00:21:37,695
I heard you were hitting on my girlfriend!

244
00:21:41,479 --> 00:21:42,939
Fuck you.

245
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:47,513
- Son of a bitch.
- Hold him.

246
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:49,515
Fuck you!

247
00:21:50,875 --> 00:21:52,060
Marion!

248
00:21:54,787 --> 00:21:56,288
Run!

249
00:21:56,661 --> 00:21:58,038
Let's go!

250
00:22:02,278 --> 00:22:03,586
Fuck you!

251
00:22:13,831 --> 00:22:15,782
My, my. Mr. Gochuico.

252
00:22:16,376 --> 00:22:18,779
I've never seen you this thirsty.

253
00:22:20,296 --> 00:22:22,590
It's my turn to be like Brian.

254
00:22:22,615 --> 00:22:24,575
It's my turn to stop you.

255
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:30,150
I guess...

256
00:22:30,890 --> 00:22:33,736
I'm doing this because...

257
00:22:35,848 --> 00:22:37,532
Brian's gone.

258
00:22:39,828 --> 00:22:41,102
Fuck.

259
00:22:42,151 --> 00:22:43,721
I miss that jerk.

260
00:22:45,697 --> 00:22:47,266
I miss Jiggy too.

261
00:22:49,784 --> 00:22:50,811
You.

262
00:22:52,620 --> 00:22:54,023
Our circle, right?

263
00:22:56,457 --> 00:22:58,042
You know what I mean?

264
00:22:58,067 --> 00:23:00,445
Ever since Brian died

265
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,907
we're never complete.

266
00:23:04,705 --> 00:23:06,165
Oh well.

267
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:10,759
I know we were just in a fight
but that felt like we're friends again.

268
00:23:13,399 --> 00:23:15,711
I get it bro, I feel you.

269
00:23:18,104 --> 00:23:19,340
Thanks for that.

270
00:23:20,481 --> 00:23:21,801
I know I've been...

271
00:23:23,255 --> 00:23:24,985
distant.

272
00:23:26,279 --> 00:23:28,265
We all have different ways of mourning.

273
00:23:30,658 --> 00:23:31,701
That's just it.

274
00:23:31,834 --> 00:23:32,903
That's why

275
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:35,747
I'm worried about you, bro.

276
00:23:36,341 --> 00:23:39,443
Man, I know you.

277
00:23:41,294 --> 00:23:42,603
You might be

278
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:46,306
doing too much blow, fucker.

279
00:23:47,850 --> 00:23:50,376
Next thing I know, you OD-ed.

280
00:23:51,140 --> 00:23:52,832
Fuck.

281
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:58,170
I don't think I'd be
able to handle that, bro.

282
00:23:59,716 --> 00:24:01,173
Fuck this, bro.

283
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:06,402
- Asshole.
- You're such a drama king, man.

284
00:24:06,427 --> 00:24:09,722
But seriously, I appreciate that.

285
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,488
You don't have to worry about me.

286
00:24:13,386 --> 00:24:15,214
I'm getting my shit together.

287
00:24:16,454 --> 00:24:19,144
I'll pay my debt to the bookie.

288
00:24:20,265 --> 00:24:21,558
How?

289
00:24:21,904 --> 00:24:23,160
More gambling?

290
00:24:24,145 --> 00:24:25,396
No, man.

291
00:24:25,421 --> 00:24:26,756
You know what?

292
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,593
Since, you backed me up,

293
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:32,800
let me make it up to you.

294
00:24:34,633 --> 00:24:36,510
I have a special event.

295
00:24:38,380 --> 00:24:39,715
Come.

296
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:43,481
So you can see

297
00:24:43,706 --> 00:24:45,541
how I'm going to make money.

298
00:24:45,566 --> 00:24:47,193
More money

299
00:24:47,485 --> 00:24:50,363
than Brian and I's gambling
business ever made.

300
00:24:52,058 --> 00:24:53,466
Ms. San Andres?

301
00:24:53,491 --> 00:24:55,785
Here's your monthly stipend.

302
00:24:55,827 --> 00:24:57,620
- Thank you, ma'am.
- You're welcome.

303
00:25:03,251 --> 00:25:05,002
Hey! Look!

304
00:25:05,044 --> 00:25:08,131
Sam and Molly messaged me already.
I told you they would.

305
00:25:08,172 --> 00:25:10,758
They're talking to all
scholars for this gig.

306
00:25:10,941 --> 00:25:12,151
They're both so nice.

307
00:25:12,176 --> 00:25:14,173
Hey, wait up!

308
00:25:16,321 --> 00:25:18,489
Remember our deal.

309
00:25:19,155 --> 00:25:21,949
Keep that door closed

310
00:25:21,974 --> 00:25:24,837
- at all times.
- Thank you, ma'am.

311
00:25:39,662 --> 00:25:41,372
Why are you here?

312
00:25:41,581 --> 00:25:44,000
We didn't send you an email.

313
00:25:44,542 --> 00:25:45,835
I know.

314
00:25:46,002 --> 00:25:50,339
It's a good thing they
told me about this gig.

315
00:25:50,798 --> 00:25:52,717
I kinda need the money.

316
00:25:53,050 --> 00:25:55,219
Maybe I can help.

317
00:25:55,344 --> 00:25:57,346
You know what, Gab?

318
00:25:58,473 --> 00:26:01,434
Maybe you're the right
girl that we're looking for.

319
00:26:02,226 --> 00:26:04,254
What? Are you...

320
00:26:07,607 --> 00:26:09,108
Molly's right.

321
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:10,610
You can join.

322
00:26:10,816 --> 00:26:13,235
Alright, we'll give you a shot.

323
00:26:14,043 --> 00:26:15,336
Okay.

324
00:26:15,757 --> 00:26:17,592
Let's not waste our time here.

325
00:26:17,617 --> 00:26:19,436
Girls, this will be quick.

326
00:26:23,818 --> 00:26:28,114
We're looking for dancers for
an exclusive house party event.

327
00:26:28,728 --> 00:26:30,188
To be more precise,

328
00:26:30,213 --> 00:26:33,925
we're looking for dancers
and entertainers for our guest.

329
00:26:34,589 --> 00:26:36,675
We will pay the girls we like,

330
00:26:36,868 --> 00:26:40,205
20,000 for a night of
drinking and partying.

331
00:26:40,387 --> 00:26:41,805
That's it.

332
00:27:21,430 --> 00:27:23,959
Hey flopcast! It's your turn.

333
00:27:26,504 --> 00:27:29,298
Show us what you got
and put your heart in it.

334
00:29:56,952 --> 00:29:58,412
Stop the music!

335
00:30:03,624 --> 00:30:05,000
Ladies...

336
00:30:05,375 --> 00:30:06,710
and gentlemen.

337
00:30:07,288 --> 00:30:08,957
I welcome you to,

338
00:30:09,713 --> 00:30:13,217
First Class!

339
00:30:14,843 --> 00:30:17,721
A night full of drugs,

340
00:30:18,352 --> 00:30:20,271
and sex.

341
00:30:20,849 --> 00:30:22,392
Name it.

342
00:30:22,690 --> 00:30:26,485
And we've got you all covered, bitches!

343
00:30:30,254 --> 00:30:31,672
Don't worry.

344
00:30:32,392 --> 00:30:34,185
Because for tonight,

345
00:30:34,947 --> 00:30:36,490
you can do anything.

346
00:30:37,282 --> 00:30:39,576
Anything you want to do.

347
00:30:40,094 --> 00:30:45,307
I got you covered! Enjoy!

348
00:30:45,332 --> 00:30:46,708
Music!

349
00:31:03,483 --> 00:31:05,485
Wow, flopcast.

350
00:31:05,977 --> 00:31:08,563
Who knew you could be this hot?

351
00:31:08,791 --> 00:31:11,084
Hot? I feel cold, actually.

352
00:31:12,251 --> 00:31:14,545
Well that's perfect

353
00:31:14,570 --> 00:31:16,863
for the person we'd like you to meet.

354
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:21,785
As promised, we have a
special participant in this party.

355
00:31:21,810 --> 00:31:23,645
Marion.

356
00:31:37,334 --> 00:31:39,778
Sam and Molly are a little too excited.

357
00:31:39,803 --> 00:31:41,638
We haven't even talked.

358
00:31:41,663 --> 00:31:43,415
This feels too close already.

359
00:31:44,690 --> 00:31:46,592
You don't need to move away.

360
00:31:47,608 --> 00:31:49,730
We can talk like this.

361
00:31:51,256 --> 00:31:53,567
If you wanna move closer,

362
00:31:54,725 --> 00:31:56,676
then that's better than okay with me.

363
00:31:59,037 --> 00:32:02,225
What if I want to enjoy your party first?

364
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,876
It looks fun.

365
00:32:05,112 --> 00:32:06,280
Wild.

366
00:32:10,055 --> 00:32:12,349
I heard the entrance fee's pricey.

367
00:32:12,747 --> 00:32:14,678
5,000 per head?

368
00:32:18,045 --> 00:32:21,612
Give me 3 more tabs.
I'll send you the 15,000.

369
00:32:21,795 --> 00:32:23,129
Calm down.

370
00:32:23,200 --> 00:32:24,868
Can't you see I'm busy?

371
00:32:25,256 --> 00:32:27,306
I'll go to you later.

372
00:32:33,690 --> 00:32:35,233
Tabs?

373
00:32:35,901 --> 00:32:38,528
You mean ecstasy?

374
00:32:40,787 --> 00:32:43,617
I didn't know there'd be
other businesses in your party.

375
00:32:45,717 --> 00:32:49,694
I didn't expect you'd know about
that kind of thing, Ms. San Andres.

376
00:32:53,374 --> 00:32:54,583
Here.

377
00:32:56,741 --> 00:32:59,428
I'll give you some for free.

378
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:03,078
No, thanks.

379
00:33:03,701 --> 00:33:06,905
Free stuff won't help your business.

380
00:33:07,429 --> 00:33:08,429
Right?

381
00:33:09,496 --> 00:33:10,975
Well...

382
00:33:13,227 --> 00:33:15,600
you can pay me some other way.

383
00:33:18,402 --> 00:33:19,537
Come on.

384
00:33:20,779 --> 00:33:22,045
Open up.

385
00:33:25,469 --> 00:33:26,678
Open up.

386
00:33:28,975 --> 00:33:30,393
You know what

387
00:33:30,687 --> 00:33:32,313
I think I need a drink.

388
00:33:32,807 --> 00:33:34,334
Cause that's a big one.

389
00:33:34,856 --> 00:33:36,599
I could get choked.

390
00:33:39,193 --> 00:33:40,319
Go.

391
00:33:41,075 --> 00:33:43,498
Get a drink. Loosen up.

392
00:33:43,971 --> 00:33:45,390
You bore me.

393
00:33:45,842 --> 00:33:48,557
Brian said you were fun.

394
00:34:06,596 --> 00:34:09,516
Oh shit. Sorry, sorry.

395
00:34:13,178 --> 00:34:16,793
Hey, what happened? Where is Gab?

396
00:34:17,500 --> 00:34:19,752
I don't get her.

397
00:34:19,980 --> 00:34:21,732
She wasn't game at all.

398
00:34:21,757 --> 00:34:23,592
Our deal is off.

399
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,305
Wait, I'll take care of it.

400
00:34:26,470 --> 00:34:28,847
The night is still young anyway.

401
00:34:29,848 --> 00:34:31,475
Alright.

402
00:34:40,442 --> 00:34:41,629
Hold her.

403
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:02,464
Name it. And we've got
you all covered, bitches!

404
00:35:02,514 --> 00:35:04,474
Fuck, I can't hear anything.

405
00:35:05,663 --> 00:35:07,177
Don't worry.

406
00:35:09,779 --> 00:35:10,947
Hello?

407
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:13,725
Hello Gab. I know what Marion's been doing.

408
00:35:14,518 --> 00:35:15,811
Emerson.

409
00:35:16,470 --> 00:35:19,514
Chill, okay? I came straight away.

410
00:35:21,332 --> 00:35:24,116
I found my way in through Sam and Molly.

411
00:35:24,468 --> 00:35:26,345
So I took the chance.

412
00:35:26,561 --> 00:35:27,687
Fuck!

413
00:35:28,080 --> 00:35:29,664
You're in his party?

414
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:32,554
Is that why you're not answering my calls?

415
00:35:34,718 --> 00:35:36,219
Get out of there!

416
00:35:36,837 --> 00:35:38,464
I'm on my way.

417
00:35:38,489 --> 00:35:40,241
But Emerson, it's a good opportunity.

418
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:45,273
I'm already here, and
Marion's been telling me a lot so,

419
00:35:45,562 --> 00:35:48,357
I just need to talk to
him in a quieter place,

420
00:35:48,382 --> 00:35:50,437
so I can record him better.

421
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:52,608
Hello?

422
00:35:53,202 --> 00:35:54,548
Hello, Gab?

423
00:35:55,433 --> 00:35:58,186
Shit. Fuck this.

424
00:36:34,097 --> 00:36:35,390
Hannah?

425
00:36:35,495 --> 00:36:38,790
- What the fuck, bro? That's my girl.
- What do you want?

426
00:36:39,561 --> 00:36:41,229
I'm sorry.

427
00:36:42,898 --> 00:36:44,774
Here, bro.

428
00:37:07,208 --> 00:37:09,836
Marion said you're looking for a drink.

429
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:12,280
Try our favorite.

430
00:37:17,715 --> 00:37:19,425
Come on, Gab.

431
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,163
If you're not gonna party with us,
then leave the party.

432
00:37:23,188 --> 00:37:25,774
And forget about our deal.

433
00:37:26,232 --> 00:37:27,901
Yeah.

434
00:37:29,085 --> 00:37:30,795
- Drink?
- You guys,

435
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:33,239
I was a little surprised, that's all.

436
00:37:34,950 --> 00:37:37,744
Cheers!

437
00:37:42,332 --> 00:37:44,501
- Cheers!
- It's good.

438
00:37:46,419 --> 00:37:47,879
That's really good.

439
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,478
Come on, Gab.

440
00:38:03,657 --> 00:38:05,242
Let loose.

441
00:38:05,477 --> 00:38:07,897
We're all fucking young,

442
00:38:08,806 --> 00:38:11,017
wild, and fucked up.

443
00:38:11,042 --> 00:38:13,378
What the fuck is happening?

444
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:17,853
Just take it all, Gab. We've got you.

445
00:41:32,562 --> 00:41:34,622
- Stop!
- Just do it!

446
00:41:34,647 --> 00:41:36,983
That's not true!

447
00:41:37,195 --> 00:41:38,626
Can't you just

448
00:41:38,651 --> 00:41:41,029
for once

449
00:41:41,054 --> 00:41:42,953
do what I want?

450
00:41:43,898 --> 00:41:46,400
If you don't belong in their world,

451
00:41:46,479 --> 00:41:49,482
then you're going to be their victim.

452
00:41:51,639 --> 00:41:53,683
You're not just an addict,

453
00:41:53,708 --> 00:41:55,507
you're a rapist!
