1
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:13,805
I welcome you to...

2
00:00:14,597 --> 00:00:19,227
First class!

3
00:00:19,310 --> 00:00:20,729
Get out of there!

4
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,731
I'm on my way.

5
00:00:43,418 --> 00:00:47,047
You know I came to Potenciana
a year earlier than you did.

6
00:00:48,751 --> 00:00:51,754
I already know how everything works.

7
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:55,138
And it's so much different
from our State University.

8
00:00:56,181 --> 00:00:58,141
Here, they always say

9
00:00:58,183 --> 00:01:00,143
everyone belongs to a level.

10
00:01:00,560 --> 00:01:02,437
And the scholars...

11
00:01:03,354 --> 00:01:05,732
are way down at the bottom,
far from everyone else.

12
00:01:07,817 --> 00:01:09,986
Jiggy! Babe!

13
00:01:14,783 --> 00:01:17,577
Is that why you dote on him too much?

14
00:01:17,602 --> 00:01:18,912
Why do you ask?

15
00:01:18,912 --> 00:01:22,665
- Well, he's big time isn't he?
- Don't say that!

16
00:01:22,665 --> 00:01:25,043
Are you calling me a gold digger?

17
00:01:25,543 --> 00:01:28,129
If we weren't friends I'd have
hit you in the head already.

18
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:29,422
Exactly!

19
00:01:29,547 --> 00:01:33,218
I can ask you straight to your
face because we are friends.

20
00:01:33,218 --> 00:01:35,220
There's no judgment.

21
00:01:35,438 --> 00:01:37,065
So is it true?

22
00:01:38,605 --> 00:01:40,065
Here's the thing.

23
00:01:40,892 --> 00:01:42,560
I'm not gonna lie to you.

24
00:01:46,272 --> 00:01:49,047
Yes, he's loaded and that's a huge factor.

25
00:01:50,902 --> 00:01:52,028
Because of him,

26
00:01:52,028 --> 00:01:57,492
I got to go on dates to places I've never
been and got to do things I've never done.

27
00:01:58,289 --> 00:01:59,331
But...

28
00:02:00,411 --> 00:02:02,872
even without those things,

29
00:02:03,123 --> 00:02:07,585
like money and adventure,

30
00:02:07,919 --> 00:02:10,046
I really do love him.

31
00:02:11,047 --> 00:02:12,590
Because,

32
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:15,260
he shows me a side of him

33
00:02:15,301 --> 00:02:17,595
that nobody else sees.

34
00:02:18,221 --> 00:02:20,974
I know him the most and,

35
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:25,019
I think that's how he grew on me.

36
00:02:25,061 --> 00:02:27,564
And deep down,

37
00:02:27,730 --> 00:02:30,108
I know he needs me more.

38
00:02:32,318 --> 00:02:34,362
Because I even get to show him love

39
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,364
that money can't buy.

40
00:02:37,282 --> 00:02:38,366
Sweet...

41
00:02:38,741 --> 00:02:39,993
I know right?

42
00:02:40,118 --> 00:02:41,995
but fucked up.

43
00:02:45,498 --> 00:02:46,749
But you know what?

44
00:02:47,257 --> 00:02:50,844
Hanging out with Jiggy
and Brian, I've noticed that

45
00:02:51,045 --> 00:02:53,131
they only seem to have the perfect life

46
00:02:53,464 --> 00:02:55,758
but they're also fucked up.

47
00:02:56,176 --> 00:02:57,468
I mean...

48
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:00,263
you're not supposed to get
everything you want, right?

49
00:03:02,265 --> 00:03:04,100
It's not all about material things, is it?

50
00:03:04,202 --> 00:03:05,303
Mm?

51
00:03:05,461 --> 00:03:07,296
When it comes to people,

52
00:03:07,937 --> 00:03:09,814
they can demand just as much,

53
00:03:09,981 --> 00:03:11,566
take just as much,

54
00:03:11,691 --> 00:03:13,943
and buy people just as easy.

55
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:17,780
You know,

56
00:03:17,906 --> 00:03:19,574
this is why you're the coolest.

57
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:21,201
Jiggy told me that

58
00:03:21,201 --> 00:03:24,954
nobody talks to Brian the way you do.

59
00:03:24,979 --> 00:03:27,618
Well, he doesn't let anybody
talk to him the way you do.

60
00:03:30,168 --> 00:03:31,920
Why shouldn't I? Look at that.

61
00:03:32,045 --> 00:03:35,215
- Mm? What?
- I'm not like his girlfriend.

62
00:03:36,345 --> 00:03:37,609
Look!

63
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,939
She's latched onto him like
he's the last man on earth.

64
00:03:41,939 --> 00:03:43,056
Oh my god.

65
00:03:45,265 --> 00:03:46,809
What do you think?

66
00:03:47,393 --> 00:03:48,937
Of Hannah?

67
00:03:50,438 --> 00:03:53,650
I actually don't know much about her.

68
00:03:53,675 --> 00:03:54,817
Although,

69
00:03:54,817 --> 00:03:57,654
I do know that she's on scholarship too,

70
00:03:58,279 --> 00:04:00,198
- She is?
- Mhmm.

71
00:04:00,949 --> 00:04:05,995
But she's also a model
and a part-time influencer.

72
00:04:06,329 --> 00:04:10,083
I mean, she's gorgeous.

73
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:13,711
And when you're beautiful,
that's the only thing that matters.

74
00:04:15,171 --> 00:04:16,422
I think.

75
00:04:20,260 --> 00:04:21,719
Babe!

76
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:23,721
- Jiggy?
- Babe!

77
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:26,516
I'll go ahead. Bye!

78
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,602
- Babe!
- You guys take care.

79
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:35,650
How's your back?

80
00:08:30,927 --> 00:08:32,512
Fuck.

81
00:08:51,280 --> 00:08:54,742
You said you wanted to
talk in a quiet place so...

82
00:08:55,159 --> 00:08:56,536
we're here.

83
00:08:58,204 --> 00:09:00,998
Don't mind them. They're about to sleep.

84
00:09:01,415 --> 00:09:03,334
I'm giving you what you want.

85
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:08,464
I just want to...

86
00:09:10,716 --> 00:09:13,719
talk to you about Brian.

87
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:24,522
Fuck.

88
00:09:26,377 --> 00:09:27,478
Gab?

89
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:31,112
Gab?

90
00:09:34,865 --> 00:09:35,950
Gab!

91
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,628
Fuck this! Brian again?!

92
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,506
He just hit on you, Gab.

93
00:09:51,132 --> 00:09:52,383
That's it.

94
00:09:54,552 --> 00:09:56,637
No. That's not true.

95
00:09:57,013 --> 00:09:59,515
He was playing you.

96
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:01,976
You're lying.

97
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:08,065
He loves me. Brian loves me.

98
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:11,319
You're a liar.

99
00:10:13,946 --> 00:10:17,325
He told me about it with pride,

100
00:10:17,742 --> 00:10:19,702
that you're a virgin.

101
00:10:22,330 --> 00:10:26,125
Don't worry. This is
gonna feel so much better

102
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,127
because you're on E.

103
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,422
Fuck you.

104
00:10:32,965 --> 00:10:36,636
- Come on!
- You're lying!

105
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:46,187
- Fuck!
- Let me go!

106
00:10:53,819 --> 00:10:56,155
Why did you have to choose Brian?!

107
00:10:56,989 --> 00:10:58,491
Why not me?

108
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:06,415
Answer me, Hannah!

109
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:08,501
Brian loves me.

110
00:11:09,752 --> 00:11:13,089
Brian loved me.

111
00:11:13,114 --> 00:11:15,966
- Gab!
- Hey! Let's drink!

112
00:11:19,754 --> 00:11:20,846
Gab!

113
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:26,060
- Gab!
- Why not me?!

114
00:11:26,936 --> 00:11:28,396
Tell me!

115
00:11:28,813 --> 00:11:30,690
Tell me, Hannah!

116
00:11:36,946 --> 00:11:38,364
Fuck!

117
00:11:38,406 --> 00:11:39,657
What the fuck, bro?!

118
00:11:41,075 --> 00:11:42,201
Let her go!

119
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:46,288
Fuck you! You're not just
an addict, but also a rapist!

120
00:11:46,831 --> 00:11:48,541
Emerson!

121
00:11:48,666 --> 00:11:50,251
- Emerson!
- Gab!

122
00:11:50,276 --> 00:11:51,377
Gab.

123
00:11:53,546 --> 00:11:55,256
Fucking junkie!

124
00:12:10,229 --> 00:12:11,480
Gab.

125
00:12:15,276 --> 00:12:17,027
Hold on tight, Gab.

126
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,029
I can't believe you.

127
00:12:19,238 --> 00:12:21,031
Hey.

128
00:12:23,312 --> 00:12:24,358
Careful.

129
00:12:34,545 --> 00:12:36,005
Fuck!

130
00:12:42,595 --> 00:12:44,805
- Let's go, Gab.
- Fuck.

131
00:12:44,847 --> 00:12:49,477
Fuck. Emerson, we need to go to the police
and tell them about Marion.

132
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,479
- Yes, Gab.
- Do you understand?

133
00:12:51,520 --> 00:12:54,648
- Yes, we're going to do that.
- He tried to rape me!

134
00:12:56,233 --> 00:12:58,110
He tried to kill me!

135
00:12:58,110 --> 00:13:01,155
We'll do it. I won't let
Marion get away with this.

136
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,825
Fuck Sam and Molly.

137
00:13:04,909 --> 00:13:09,872
I'm sure they had something to do
with this. I'm sure they were in on this.

138
00:13:11,373 --> 00:13:12,833
Gab, I promise.

139
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:15,544
I swear they will all pay for this.

140
00:13:15,961 --> 00:13:17,630
But...shit.

141
00:13:17,838 --> 00:13:21,258
You can't talk to the police in that state.

142
00:13:21,717 --> 00:13:23,636
They won't believe you.

143
00:13:23,677 --> 00:13:25,554
They might even arrest you.

144
00:13:25,846 --> 00:13:29,266
If that happens then Marion stays free.

145
00:13:29,558 --> 00:13:33,062
Fuck this! FUCK!!!

146
00:13:43,781 --> 00:13:46,617
I was so afraid for this to happen, Gab.

147
00:13:46,742 --> 00:13:48,953
You shouldn't have gone there.

148
00:13:49,036 --> 00:13:52,122
- I wish you'd have listened to me.
- Shut it.

149
00:13:52,248 --> 00:13:56,460
I took the opportunity
to clear Brian's name.

150
00:13:56,460 --> 00:13:58,212
Because I couldn't do it.

151
00:13:58,212 --> 00:14:00,631
I just wanted to make it up to him.

152
00:14:00,673 --> 00:14:02,040
This is all my fault.

153
00:14:02,040 --> 00:14:05,736
What are you talking
about? How is it your fault?

154
00:14:05,761 --> 00:14:07,805
Before he died

155
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:11,308
he told me Hannah
wanted to tell him something.

156
00:14:11,642 --> 00:14:15,563
That she was keeping something from him
and I don't know what it is.

157
00:14:15,729 --> 00:14:18,190
But I didn't listen to him.

158
00:14:19,608 --> 00:14:22,945
Instead, I pushed him away.

159
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:25,823
If only I tried to understand him.

160
00:14:26,031 --> 00:14:28,117
I should've listened.

161
00:14:28,242 --> 00:14:30,911
Then maybe he'd still
be fucking alive today.

162
00:14:31,328 --> 00:14:33,622
He shouldn't have died.

163
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:35,541
I feel the same way, Gab.

164
00:14:37,334 --> 00:14:40,671
If I had asked more about that
night he entrusted you to me

165
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,548
then I would have been able to help him.

166
00:14:42,548 --> 00:14:45,134
I know how you feel.

167
00:14:46,635 --> 00:14:50,180
If I had asked more about that
night he entrusted you to me

168
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,474
I could have helped him.

169
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:56,061
We couldn't do anything for Brian then.

170
00:14:56,437 --> 00:14:58,731
But together, Gab,

171
00:14:58,981 --> 00:15:00,733
we can have each other's backs for Brian.

172
00:15:01,483 --> 00:15:03,569
Fuck, where's my phone?

173
00:15:16,790 --> 00:15:18,334
I'm so wasted...

174
00:15:20,044 --> 00:15:21,378
I didn't mean to...

175
00:15:22,046 --> 00:15:23,672
I need to talk to Gab.

176
00:15:25,341 --> 00:15:29,845
Marion, I think we have a bigger problem.

177
00:15:31,555 --> 00:15:32,723
I think...

178
00:15:33,265 --> 00:15:36,185
Gab had another reason
for coming to our party.

179
00:15:46,528 --> 00:15:48,822
Where's my bag?

180
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:51,617
Where the fuck is my
bag? My phone's in there!

181
00:15:51,742 --> 00:15:53,369
We need it!

182
00:15:53,369 --> 00:15:57,706
- We need my phone to pin Marion down!
- We can't go back there.

183
00:15:57,998 --> 00:16:00,334
- Fuck this!
- Calm down.

184
00:16:01,627 --> 00:16:04,964
- We still have a shot against him.
- What?

185
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,216
Here.

186
00:16:08,175 --> 00:16:10,344
I recorded a video earlier.

187
00:16:15,099 --> 00:16:17,726
Let's go to the police. Now.

188
00:16:17,935 --> 00:16:19,895
I was actually planning to do that, Gab.

189
00:16:20,553 --> 00:16:21,614
But,

190
00:16:21,639 --> 00:16:23,558
because of Marion's message,

191
00:16:23,941 --> 00:16:27,736
now that he knows we're out to get him,

192
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:30,990
this may not be the best move for us.

193
00:16:31,073 --> 00:16:33,867
We're running in circles here!

194
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,204
So we do the best move and then what?

195
00:16:37,329 --> 00:16:38,706
He gets away again?

196
00:16:39,123 --> 00:16:41,625
Fuck it, enough!

197
00:16:47,881 --> 00:16:50,050
I'm gonna do things my way.

198
00:16:50,592 --> 00:16:52,386
What do you mean?

199
00:16:53,095 --> 00:16:54,680
There's something you need to know.

200
00:16:58,726 --> 00:17:00,310
I'll be honest with you.

201
00:17:00,811 --> 00:17:03,647
Good evening to all my virgins and freaks.

202
00:17:04,773 --> 00:17:08,402
I am so sorry for making
you wait for so long.

203
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,447
But as promised,

204
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:14,033
here's the latest update

205
00:17:14,324 --> 00:17:17,119
from Brian Zuniga and Hannah Andal's case.

206
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:19,121
Don't worry.

207
00:17:19,997 --> 00:17:22,875
Your patience won't go unrewarded.

208
00:17:23,125 --> 00:17:26,462
Because I went into a deep dive

209
00:17:27,337 --> 00:17:30,466
into the secret world
of Potenciana University

210
00:17:30,758 --> 00:17:35,763
for this fucking ultimate exposé.

211
00:17:36,138 --> 00:17:38,474
Like Alice in Wonderland,

212
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:41,351
I fell down into a rabbit hole.

213
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:45,814
I didn't expect that world to be so dark,

214
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:48,192
so deep...

215
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,779
and so disgusting.

216
00:17:51,945 --> 00:17:57,159
Tradition, legacy, and wealth.

217
00:17:57,326 --> 00:18:00,913
On the surface, that's what
Potenciana University is all about.

218
00:18:01,830 --> 00:18:03,582
But behind all that,

219
00:18:04,166 --> 00:18:09,797
are nothing more but
spoiled, entitled students

220
00:18:10,089 --> 00:18:13,342
who use their parents' money and power.

221
00:18:14,843 --> 00:18:16,929
And they use it for parties,

222
00:18:17,137 --> 00:18:18,597
alcohol,

223
00:18:18,722 --> 00:18:20,307
and drugs and sex.

224
00:18:20,557 --> 00:18:23,894
Be careful what you wish for, darling.

225
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:28,732
Because if you don't belong to their world,

226
00:18:31,485 --> 00:18:34,655
they'll step on you like dirt,

227
00:18:35,656 --> 00:18:38,992
and judge your character.

228
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:43,080
Like I said earlier,

229
00:18:43,539 --> 00:18:47,000
this is the ultimate exposé.

230
00:18:50,921 --> 00:18:53,841
And that includes unmasking myself.

231
00:19:01,682 --> 00:19:07,146
I am hoping you believe
what I tell you tonight.

232
00:19:09,273 --> 00:19:11,608
And that is why I need you to see

233
00:19:11,692 --> 00:19:15,612
the face of one of their victims.

234
00:19:28,959 --> 00:19:31,295
I am Gab San Andres.

235
00:19:31,545 --> 00:19:34,464
And I was almost killed

236
00:19:34,965 --> 00:19:37,426
and raped

237
00:19:38,552 --> 00:19:41,221
by Marion Valles.

238
00:19:54,776 --> 00:19:56,111
Unmasked!

239
00:19:56,695 --> 00:19:59,615
Your Girl V has finally
revealed herself to be

240
00:19:59,615 --> 00:20:02,751
What are you talking
about? How is it your fault?

241
00:20:03,160 --> 00:20:07,070
But even more distressing news is her rape

242
00:20:07,093 --> 00:20:10,632
accusation against her
co-student, Marion Valles.

243
00:20:10,931 --> 00:20:12,808
For your information,

244
00:20:13,295 --> 00:20:15,464
I didn't rape Gab.

245
00:20:15,589 --> 00:20:17,966
What happened was consensual.

246
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,677
Gab was willing to join the party.

247
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:22,471
Everyone saw her

248
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:26,099
dancing and having fun with Marion.

249
00:20:27,476 --> 00:20:29,394
Gab was lying.

250
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:32,314
She took drugs on her own.

251
00:20:33,732 --> 00:20:37,069
Why is she putting the blame on us now?

252
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:39,404
Hashtag,

253
00:20:40,155 --> 00:20:41,823
we need justice.

254
00:20:42,241 --> 00:20:43,700
We were just having fun.

255
00:20:44,952 --> 00:20:47,454
It was actually Gab who told me to

256
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:49,456
choke her.

257
00:20:50,666 --> 00:20:52,292
I was shocked to learn

258
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:55,128
that that was her kink.

259
00:20:56,088 --> 00:20:57,464
So why...

260
00:20:58,632 --> 00:21:00,676
why is she calling me a criminal?

261
00:21:24,157 --> 00:21:25,211
Dad?

262
00:21:26,910 --> 00:21:30,163
Dad please, can we not argue today?

263
00:21:31,081 --> 00:21:32,833
I'm sorry, Gab.

264
00:21:35,836 --> 00:21:37,212
I'm right here.

265
00:21:37,671 --> 00:21:39,423
You're not alone.

266
00:21:43,468 --> 00:21:44,886
You're not alone.

267
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:54,521
Dad.

268
00:21:59,234 --> 00:22:00,861
I'm sorry.

269
00:22:03,530 --> 00:22:05,365
I'm really sorry.

270
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:11,663
Sorry.

271
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:29,931
This way, dad.

272
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,020
It's not that.

273
00:22:35,645 --> 00:22:38,273
I've gotten to know those names before.

274
00:22:38,940 --> 00:22:41,401
They had an illegal business then.

275
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:43,403
And I made a report about it.

276
00:22:44,071 --> 00:22:45,697
But when they found out,

277
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,658
they used their money

278
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,994
and influence

279
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:53,413
to bury the story.

280
00:22:53,830 --> 00:22:55,415
No, not just the story.

281
00:22:56,041 --> 00:22:57,417
But me as well.

282
00:22:57,417 --> 00:23:00,045
They found a way to ruin me too.

283
00:23:02,964 --> 00:23:05,217
So that's why you warned me about them.

284
00:23:10,972 --> 00:23:12,349
I'm sorry, dad.

285
00:23:13,809 --> 00:23:15,977
If I just knew all that,

286
00:23:16,061 --> 00:23:19,272
I wouldn't have said the things I said.

287
00:23:22,359 --> 00:23:24,361
It's my fault too.

288
00:23:24,986 --> 00:23:27,572
If I was braver back then,

289
00:23:27,864 --> 00:23:30,242
and pushed through with the exposé,

290
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:33,120
then maybe I could have taken them down.

291
00:23:33,703 --> 00:23:36,873
And that Valles wouldn't
have had this much influence,

292
00:23:36,873 --> 00:23:38,875
and the audacity to do what he did to you.

293
00:23:41,628 --> 00:23:43,296
Today,

294
00:23:44,881 --> 00:23:47,050
we're facing them head on.

295
00:23:50,989 --> 00:23:52,011
Come on.

296
00:23:55,976 --> 00:23:59,896
- Don't worry attorney, we'll fix this.
- Yes.

297
00:24:00,939 --> 00:24:03,233
Ms. San Andres.

298
00:24:05,026 --> 00:24:08,697
Well we're all here to talk
about what has happened.

299
00:24:09,948 --> 00:24:12,451
Looks like you've
already settled things here.

300
00:24:14,453 --> 00:24:17,622
What kind of evidence you still need, Dean?

301
00:24:17,914 --> 00:24:19,624
Everything was caught on video, right?

302
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:21,918
I'm sorry, Ms. San Andres.

303
00:24:22,002 --> 00:24:24,129
That video is circumstantial.

304
00:24:24,379 --> 00:24:28,341
And your sexual act was consensual.
Right, attorney?

305
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,343
Yes.

306
00:24:32,262 --> 00:24:35,265
They fed me drugs without my knowledge.

307
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:38,101
How can I give my fucking consent?

308
00:24:38,560 --> 00:24:40,437
That man choked me.

309
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:44,191
If it wasn't for Emerson,
he might have killed me.

310
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,902
Sir that's not true.

311
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:50,197
You asked me to choke you.

312
00:24:50,822 --> 00:24:52,491
I was so shocked that

313
00:24:52,908 --> 00:24:55,577
- you were so kinky.
- You're disgustingly rude.

314
00:24:55,744 --> 00:24:58,872
Stop threatening my client, Mr. San Andres.

315
00:24:58,872 --> 00:25:01,249
- You're all a bunch of liars.
- Enough.

316
00:25:01,708 --> 00:25:04,211
This matter is beyond the University.

317
00:25:04,586 --> 00:25:07,088
And the courts will have to settle this.

318
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:10,842
Do expect that we'll be filing
a case against your client.

319
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:14,304
Well it's your daughter's
word against theirs.

320
00:25:14,387 --> 00:25:17,224
Everyone will see you for
who you really are, Gab.

321
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:20,644
That you are nothing more

322
00:25:20,727 --> 00:25:22,646
than an attention seeking

323
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:25,148
wannabe reporter.

324
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:30,570
You're not just an addict,
you're a fucking rapist.

325
00:25:31,404 --> 00:25:33,573
Everyone will soon wake up and see

326
00:25:33,657 --> 00:25:35,992
that if you could do it to me

327
00:25:36,409 --> 00:25:38,745
then you could have done it to Hannah too.

328
00:25:39,246 --> 00:25:42,624
And you could have even hurt Brian.

329
00:25:43,166 --> 00:25:45,585
I didn't do anything to them.

330
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:48,505
That's enough.

331
00:25:48,672 --> 00:25:50,507
Stop it.

332
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:53,176
All of you are suspended

333
00:25:53,343 --> 00:25:55,845
until this case is closed.

334
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:58,807
Let's go.

335
00:25:59,015 --> 00:26:01,309
This is pointless.

336
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:23,790
Chloe.

337
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:26,084
Did you get my messages?

338
00:26:26,209 --> 00:26:28,086
Why haven't you been texting me back?

339
00:26:30,839 --> 00:26:33,049
Chloe, are you okay?

340
00:26:36,303 --> 00:26:37,846
I'm sorry, Chloe.

341
00:26:38,805 --> 00:26:41,558
I heard you and Jiggy broke up.

342
00:26:41,891 --> 00:26:43,560
Seriously, Gab?

343
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,939
Everything's clear.

344
00:26:50,275 --> 00:26:52,902
You're just like them.

345
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:56,281
Liars.

346
00:26:57,616 --> 00:26:59,618
You all deserve each other.

347
00:27:04,998 --> 00:27:08,960
I really wanted to tell you
about Jiggy and Coach,

348
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:12,756
- even about the podcast but I got busy-
- But did you?

349
00:27:13,506 --> 00:27:14,758
Gab.

350
00:27:15,675 --> 00:27:19,095
You're the only friend I had in Potenciana.

351
00:27:20,221 --> 00:27:23,808
I can't believe you did that to me.

352
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:27,354
You know what?

353
00:27:28,355 --> 00:27:31,441
The fact that you're V is easier to accept.

354
00:27:32,442 --> 00:27:36,154
But you knew about Jiggy and Coach,
and you didn't tell me?

355
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:45,038
Coach Saenz may have left Potenciana,

356
00:27:46,122 --> 00:27:49,125
but Jiggy still chose him over me.

357
00:27:52,337 --> 00:27:54,464
I thought Jiggy loved me.

358
00:27:57,217 --> 00:27:59,803
But everything is a fucking lie!

359
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,307
My own best friend

360
00:28:04,891 --> 00:28:07,018
also made a fool out of me.

361
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:09,020
Chloe...

362
00:28:09,604 --> 00:28:12,982
give me a chance to make it up to you.

363
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:17,862
- I just don't want you to get hurt.
- I'm already hurt.

364
00:28:19,906 --> 00:28:23,660
I don't know who to trust here anymore.

365
00:28:34,045 --> 00:28:37,340
If the only thing you're
looking for is my forgiveness,

366
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,802
I'll give it to you.

367
00:28:41,594 --> 00:28:43,513
I forgive you, Gab.

368
00:28:47,976 --> 00:28:50,145
But I will never

369
00:28:50,437 --> 00:28:54,941
ever forget what you did.

370
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,612
Our friendship is done.

371
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:02,741
Chloe.

372
00:29:08,955 --> 00:29:10,081
Gab.

373
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:13,543
Thank you for giving me
the chance to talk to you.

374
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:21,342
I know you're just being a
guidance counselor, Ms. Arceo.

375
00:29:22,719 --> 00:29:24,262
It's more than that.

376
00:29:24,721 --> 00:29:27,807
I just want you to know that I
understand what you're going through.

377
00:29:27,974 --> 00:29:31,811
And I know that this
fight isn't an easy one.

378
00:29:32,103 --> 00:29:33,813
Don't stop.

379
00:29:35,273 --> 00:29:38,943
I'm so sorry I wasn't
able to defend you earlier.

380
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:41,905
I am nothing against them too.

381
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:47,869
But I am glad to know
you changed your mind.

382
00:29:49,662 --> 00:29:51,164
Just like you,

383
00:29:51,289 --> 00:29:55,668
Hannah is also a victim of
these rich and powerful kids.

384
00:30:01,716 --> 00:30:04,260
Have you visited her yet?

385
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,057
No, I haven't.

386
00:30:09,766 --> 00:30:13,895
I'm not sure if I need to.

387
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:18,233
She'd appreciate it if you visit her.

388
00:30:18,983 --> 00:30:24,447
And she'd be grateful for your help
in seeking justice for her too.

389
00:30:29,702 --> 00:30:32,080
I'll try.

390
00:30:59,691 --> 00:31:00,733
Bitch.

391
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,235
Attention seeker.

392
00:31:03,278 --> 00:31:04,445
Bully.

393
00:31:04,571 --> 00:31:06,322
Finicky. Promiscuous.

394
00:31:08,116 --> 00:31:11,452
I thought you were that simple, Hannah.

395
00:31:12,120 --> 00:31:13,997
That's why I was so quick to be mad at you.

396
00:31:14,789 --> 00:31:16,541
You made it easy for me to hate you,

397
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:19,252
and envy you, even.

398
00:31:56,247 --> 00:31:57,957
Alright.

399
00:32:06,341 --> 00:32:08,343
What are you doing here?

400
00:32:08,468 --> 00:32:11,012
I told you not to be rude, remember?

401
00:32:11,220 --> 00:32:14,891
Well, you can't hide
behind your lawyers now.

402
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:18,061
Are you kidding me, asshole?

403
00:32:18,895 --> 00:32:21,147
If you hurt me,

404
00:32:21,397 --> 00:32:23,399
I'll have you rot in jail.

405
00:32:23,691 --> 00:32:25,026
Dickhead.

406
00:32:25,109 --> 00:32:26,986
There's only us in here.

407
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:30,239
Nobody else around to
help you, just like Gab.

408
00:32:37,121 --> 00:32:41,417
It's just your word, against mine.

409
00:32:52,679 --> 00:32:56,265
Fuck you asshole!

410
00:32:58,851 --> 00:33:00,436
You wanna drink?

411
00:33:13,241 --> 00:33:14,951
That was heavy.

412
00:33:16,661 --> 00:33:18,287
Are you drunk already?

413
00:33:18,413 --> 00:33:20,665
I told you we should have gotten beer.

414
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:25,378
You had to try gin.

415
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,924
Yeah but it tastes like gasoline.

416
00:33:34,721 --> 00:33:36,347
What's bothering you?

417
00:33:42,603 --> 00:33:43,855
Do you think

418
00:33:48,526 --> 00:33:50,361
Brian loved me?

419
00:33:51,070 --> 00:33:52,363
Yes.

420
00:33:52,488 --> 00:33:55,491
Where's this doubt coming from?

421
00:34:01,289 --> 00:34:03,583
I really don't know

422
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:06,502
what to believe anymore.

423
00:34:13,051 --> 00:34:16,679
It doesn't matter anymore since

424
00:34:18,848 --> 00:34:20,975
nothing's gonna change anyway.

425
00:34:21,851 --> 00:34:24,854
- Let's just fucking drink.
- Hey Gab.

426
00:34:25,813 --> 00:34:27,288
Gab.

427
00:34:27,774 --> 00:34:30,068
Brian's my best friend.

428
00:34:31,402 --> 00:34:33,696
You changed him.

429
00:34:34,197 --> 00:34:36,032
He loved you, okay?

430
00:34:36,199 --> 00:34:38,493
And if he was here today,

431
00:34:38,659 --> 00:34:44,040
he'd be here instead of
me, taking care of you.

432
00:34:48,961 --> 00:34:52,548
Why are you doing this anyway?

433
00:34:53,216 --> 00:34:54,675
What?

434
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:57,929
Emerson, please

435
00:34:58,054 --> 00:35:01,432
don't give me that bullshit reason again.

436
00:35:01,641 --> 00:35:03,434
I'm not buying it.

437
00:35:16,239 --> 00:35:18,241
I miss him so much.

438
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:21,244
Gab, come on.

439
00:35:27,834 --> 00:35:30,002
Hey.

440
00:35:30,128 --> 00:35:33,798
I'm sure Brian wouldn't want
to see you crying like this.

441
00:35:34,507 --> 00:35:35,716
You know,

442
00:35:35,842 --> 00:35:38,594
I didn't even cry during his funeral.

443
00:35:40,596 --> 00:35:42,557
But not once

444
00:35:42,890 --> 00:35:44,892
did I think

445
00:35:45,101 --> 00:35:48,146
- that I wasn't his friend.
- Mm?

446
00:35:48,688 --> 00:35:50,606
I get it, you know.

447
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:54,026
Besides, he doesn't like the drama.

448
00:35:54,152 --> 00:35:56,028
So stop crying.

449
00:35:58,212 --> 00:35:59,245
Shit.

450
00:36:00,867 --> 00:36:02,827
Thank you.

451
00:36:02,852 --> 00:36:04,604
For what?

452
00:36:07,373 --> 00:36:08,666
Just...

453
00:36:08,875 --> 00:36:11,794
- Stop crying, it's okay.
- thank you, for everything.

454
00:36:48,706 --> 00:36:50,666
Shit.

455
00:40:17,373 --> 00:40:19,500
Thanks again for visiting Hannah.

456
00:40:19,750 --> 00:40:22,670
People don't come often.

457
00:40:23,662 --> 00:40:25,244
Are you her sister?

458
00:40:26,535 --> 00:40:27,870
Best friend?

459
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:32,179
I'm just an acquaintance, doc.

460
00:40:32,638 --> 00:40:34,181
I see.

461
00:40:35,224 --> 00:40:37,685
Well coma patients usually wake up

462
00:40:37,726 --> 00:40:41,188
after hearing a trigger
from their environment.

463
00:40:42,690 --> 00:40:44,108
Usually,

464
00:40:44,942 --> 00:40:47,069
it's from familiar voices of their family.

465
00:40:47,736 --> 00:40:49,071
Loved ones, you know?

466
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,663
Anyway, we can transfer her to a
regular room now that she's stable.

467
00:40:58,122 --> 00:41:00,791
Of course she still
needs regular monitoring

468
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:02,918
but there's no need
for her to be in the ICU.

469
00:41:07,506 --> 00:41:09,008
Ma'am?

470
00:41:09,091 --> 00:41:12,052
Hannah's family haven't come, have they?

471
00:41:14,972 --> 00:41:16,307
No, they haven't.

472
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,147
Alright. Please inform
them when they do, okay?

473
00:41:23,272 --> 00:41:24,607
Thank you.

474
00:41:38,746 --> 00:41:41,123
Sometimes, hunches are correct.

475
00:41:41,457 --> 00:41:44,210
You feel like you just know a person.

476
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:46,212
No words needed.

477
00:41:48,047 --> 00:41:52,843
So to all my subscribers who stayed,

478
00:41:53,594 --> 00:41:55,763
even when I'm not V anymore,

479
00:41:56,055 --> 00:41:57,765
thank you.

480
00:41:58,641 --> 00:42:01,393
But I do have a favor to ask.

481
00:42:02,353 --> 00:42:05,022
To those who know Hannah Andal,

482
00:42:05,147 --> 00:42:10,194
and her family, relatives,
or to anyone who knows her,

483
00:42:10,653 --> 00:42:12,738
please let me know.

484
00:42:18,827 --> 00:42:23,290
Here. That's her. That's Hannah.

485
00:42:23,916 --> 00:42:26,335
To whoever knows her,

486
00:42:26,335 --> 00:42:29,630
to anybody close to her and her family,

487
00:42:29,630 --> 00:42:32,925
let's help Hannah recover faster.

488
00:42:33,300 --> 00:42:36,554
Wherever you are, we can go to you.

489
00:42:36,845 --> 00:42:38,556
Please.

490
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:40,558
Message me.

491
00:43:13,257 --> 00:43:17,344
Hannah, you won't believe
how relieved I am that you're awake,

492
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,264
I was so worried about you.

493
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:23,100
But I knew you'd fight.

494
00:43:23,183 --> 00:43:25,102
And now you're here.

495
00:43:28,564 --> 00:43:31,150
I want to know everything that happened

496
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:33,152
while I was unconscious.

497
00:43:34,069 --> 00:43:38,240
Let's go, Miss. Hannah's
house is right over there.

498
00:43:38,782 --> 00:43:42,411
Aunt Edna's been waiting for you.

499
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:51,295
How are you?

500
00:43:51,795 --> 00:43:53,297
I'm good.

501
00:43:53,505 --> 00:43:57,509
Thank you so much for
messaging me, Ms. Edna.

502
00:43:58,469 --> 00:44:01,847
If I knew about Hannah earlier,

503
00:44:02,056 --> 00:44:05,100
I would have communicated with you sooner.

504
00:44:06,268 --> 00:44:09,855
Don't think about it too much, Ms. Edna.

505
00:44:11,065 --> 00:44:12,691
I suggest you take some rest.

506
00:44:12,983 --> 00:44:14,693
Don't think about it.

507
00:44:14,943 --> 00:44:16,695
You need to recover first.

508
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,198
Please?

509
00:44:19,490 --> 00:44:21,700
I want to know everything.

510
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,705
The police are investigating.

511
00:44:26,872 --> 00:44:31,794
And they've been talking
to possible suspects.

512
00:44:32,169 --> 00:44:34,463
Like Brian's friends.

513
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:37,091
But they all had an alibi.

514
00:44:38,801 --> 00:44:40,719
What did the police say?

515
00:44:41,136 --> 00:44:43,931
They believe Brian
took his life out of guilt.

516
00:44:44,181 --> 00:44:46,350
after raping you and,

517
00:44:46,558 --> 00:44:49,645
after thinking he killed you.

518
00:44:53,691 --> 00:44:57,778
Then this certain podcast came up.

519
00:44:58,153 --> 00:45:00,531
With an anonymous podcaster

520
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:03,534
and nobody knew where she came from.

521
00:45:05,661 --> 00:45:11,792
She got each suspect involved.

522
00:45:11,917 --> 00:45:14,211
And you're one of them, Hannah.

523
00:45:16,004 --> 00:45:18,465
Did they find out who she is?

524
00:45:18,757 --> 00:45:20,467
It was Gab.

525
00:45:23,429 --> 00:45:27,015
How? How could she accuse me?

526
00:45:27,266 --> 00:45:32,938
I guess she believed Brian
wouldn't do the things he's accused of.

527
00:45:33,897 --> 00:45:35,524
But don't worry,

528
00:45:35,691 --> 00:45:37,776
she's done blaming you.

529
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:40,362
She's on your side now.

530
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:45,409
In fact, she's looking for your family now
out of so much concern.

531
00:45:47,244 --> 00:45:49,121
She won't find anyone.

532
00:45:49,788 --> 00:45:52,124
Hannah's awake now.

533
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:56,086
I'll tell her we talked.

534
00:45:56,628 --> 00:45:59,173
And that someone from the island Tanglaw

535
00:45:59,298 --> 00:46:01,175
cares and worries about her.

536
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,510
Thank you so much, Gab.

537
00:46:03,719 --> 00:46:07,306
I loved that child too,

538
00:46:07,431 --> 00:46:12,019
and it hurts that

539
00:46:13,520 --> 00:46:15,481
she got the same fate as her sister

540
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,984
who was just as unlucky

541
00:46:18,984 --> 00:46:20,986
at Potenciana.

542
00:46:21,278 --> 00:46:22,946
That's too bad.

543
00:46:24,031 --> 00:46:25,365
Sister?

544
00:46:25,657 --> 00:46:28,702
Hannah has a sister?

545
00:46:29,286 --> 00:46:30,704
I know.

546
00:46:33,582 --> 00:46:35,918
I wanna talk to Gab.

547
00:46:36,084 --> 00:46:37,920
For what?

548
00:46:39,505 --> 00:46:41,256
I want to know

549
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,884
what else she found out.

550
00:46:45,886 --> 00:46:48,555
At the right time, Hannah.

551
00:46:49,973 --> 00:46:52,518
What do you mean

552
00:46:52,726 --> 00:46:54,520
she was unlucky?

553
00:46:55,687 --> 00:46:59,191
She was raped at Potenciana.

554
00:47:05,489 --> 00:47:07,616
I was with him on the rooftop.

555
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:11,245
I was just trying to fix our relationship.

556
00:47:11,411 --> 00:47:13,848
And then Marion came.

557
00:47:17,824 --> 00:47:19,784
And he was so angry.
