1
00:00:13,062 --> 00:00:15,064
Good evening...

2
00:00:18,547 --> 00:00:21,820
to all my virgins and freaks.

3
00:00:23,578 --> 00:00:26,623
And welcome to another episode
of Murder Nights,

4
00:00:26,718 --> 00:00:28,750
with me...

5
00:00:28,834 --> 00:00:31,044
your girl, V.

6
00:00:38,677 --> 00:00:40,470
Unlike everyone else...

7
00:00:40,495 --> 00:00:42,514
I'm not a tease.

8
00:00:42,514 --> 00:00:44,224
This one isn't just new...

9
00:00:44,224 --> 00:00:48,061
our latest true crime story is on-going

10
00:00:48,086 --> 00:00:50,705
It was a few hours ago

11
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:53,483
when news broke out
at Potenciana University

12
00:00:53,483 --> 00:00:56,285
in the town of San Lucas.

13
00:01:04,738 --> 00:01:06,121
Once a year

14
00:01:06,121 --> 00:01:08,123
they hold a barristers' night

15
00:01:08,123 --> 00:01:10,876
at Potenciana University.

16
00:01:12,293 --> 00:01:14,713
It's a wild party...

17
00:01:14,713 --> 00:01:18,191
for all their future attorneys at law.

18
00:01:23,914 --> 00:01:27,934
Sex, passion, scandal,

19
00:01:27,934 --> 00:01:31,730
betrayal, and more sex.

20
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:34,983
I'm giving you everything.

21
00:01:36,484 --> 00:01:38,194
Correction,

22
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:40,155
it's not just going to be wild

23
00:01:40,155 --> 00:01:41,323
but...

24
00:01:41,323 --> 00:01:43,909
steaming hot too.

25
00:01:43,909 --> 00:01:46,161
Isn't it ironic?

26
00:01:46,161 --> 00:01:47,996
For one night...

27
00:01:47,996 --> 00:01:50,457
there are no restrictions,

28
00:01:50,535 --> 00:01:52,876
no right or wrong,

29
00:01:53,894 --> 00:01:56,646
and there are no rules.

30
00:01:56,671 --> 00:01:59,341
There are no limits,

31
00:01:59,341 --> 00:02:01,526
you can do whatever you like
-Shit.

32
00:02:01,551 --> 00:02:03,803
with whomever you want.

33
00:02:47,015 --> 00:02:48,374
You two!

34
00:02:51,126 --> 00:02:53,103
Hannah!!!

35
00:02:53,353 --> 00:02:56,773
Submit me coach!

36
00:03:01,820 --> 00:03:03,530
Jiggy!

37
00:03:05,991 --> 00:03:08,284
What are you doing?

38
00:03:08,743 --> 00:03:10,745
What the hell?

39
00:03:12,414 --> 00:03:14,207
Babe!

40
00:03:16,751 --> 00:03:18,837
- Hello?
- Dude, are you sure..

41
00:03:18,837 --> 00:03:20,839
- Yeah, right there.
- with what you're doing?

42
00:03:20,839 --> 00:03:22,841
What did you say?

43
00:03:22,841 --> 00:03:24,592
Fuck...

44
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:26,594
Don't worry about it.

45
00:03:26,594 --> 00:03:28,555
I won't screw it up.

46
00:03:37,580 --> 00:03:39,249
Rape!

47
00:03:39,274 --> 00:03:40,483
Rape!!!

48
00:03:41,234 --> 00:03:42,986
Babe!

49
00:03:56,316 --> 00:03:59,653
But the problem with playing with fire...

50
00:04:00,268 --> 00:04:02,020
you don't just get burned.

51
00:04:02,756 --> 00:04:03,882
You...

52
00:04:03,882 --> 00:04:05,884
die.

53
00:04:07,177 --> 00:04:09,095
Stop taking photos!

54
00:04:09,095 --> 00:04:12,307
Enough! Enough!
I said stop taking photos!

55
00:04:12,390 --> 00:04:14,784
I said enough! Hey!
Are you deaf?

56
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:17,020
Fuck you! Asshole!

57
00:04:22,023 --> 00:04:23,725
Stop taking photos! Please!
You! Stop that!

58
00:04:23,725 --> 00:04:25,477
Please stop taking photos.

59
00:04:25,477 --> 00:04:27,928
That's enough! Hey! Hey!
Fuck you!

60
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:33,546
- Stop being insensitive!
- Stop taking pictures!

61
00:04:42,007 --> 00:04:46,122
Brian Zuniga, 19 years old,

62
00:04:46,647 --> 00:04:48,413
sophomore student.

63
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,084
Dead.

64
00:04:50,483 --> 00:04:53,880
Our story starts with him.

65
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:55,882
Help us!

66
00:04:55,882 --> 00:04:57,759
It's Hannah!

67
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,596
Help! Help! Hannah's hurt!

68
00:05:01,596 --> 00:05:04,224
And like every good story...

69
00:05:04,563 --> 00:05:08,686
the plot always thickens.

70
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:11,564
Hannah what happened... Hannah!

71
00:05:11,564 --> 00:05:14,400
Hannah...Help!

72
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:16,361
Hannah!

73
00:05:16,361 --> 00:05:18,613
Hannah...Hannah...

74
00:05:18,613 --> 00:05:21,366
Hannah! What happened...

75
00:05:21,391 --> 00:05:24,911
Hannah...Hannah...Hannah...

76
00:07:08,938 --> 00:07:12,071
If Brian is Potenciana's prince,

77
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:16,048
then Hannah Andal, his girlfriend,

78
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:17,909
is the princess.

79
00:07:19,212 --> 00:07:20,501
She's beautiful...

80
00:07:20,922 --> 00:07:22,006
kind-hearted...

81
00:07:22,089 --> 00:07:23,633
smart...

82
00:07:24,024 --> 00:07:26,526
and she comes from an affluent family.

83
00:07:27,094 --> 00:07:29,180
They're just made for each other.

84
00:07:29,305 --> 00:07:32,892
Everybody thinks they're the perfect couple

85
00:07:33,455 --> 00:07:36,681
and they lived happily ever after.

86
00:07:37,355 --> 00:07:39,357
That's what everybody thought,

87
00:07:39,382 --> 00:07:41,227
about Brian and Hannah's love story,

88
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,489
and not this horrible tragedy.

89
00:07:47,531 --> 00:07:50,868
Oh shit, Brian posted 10 minutes ago!

90
00:07:53,037 --> 00:07:56,582
Wait, is this a suicide note?

91
00:07:57,848 --> 00:08:00,226
This is a suicide note!
I think you're right!

92
00:08:00,251 --> 00:08:04,382
It sounds like a suicide note!

93
00:08:25,514 --> 00:08:27,683
Don't get too excited...

94
00:08:28,745 --> 00:08:32,749
like I said, it's only been hours since.

95
00:08:32,774 --> 00:08:35,777
The investigation has just started.

96
00:08:41,685 --> 00:08:43,396
Here's a spicy scoop.

97
00:08:43,749 --> 00:08:45,792
Just in, from a reliable source.

98
00:08:45,817 --> 00:08:48,149
Hannah Andal is alive.

99
00:08:51,907 --> 00:08:54,432
She's stable, but in a coma.

100
00:08:56,337 --> 00:08:58,240
And when she wakes up

101
00:08:58,281 --> 00:08:59,741
we hope she can shed some light

102
00:08:59,766 --> 00:09:02,829
on this mystery with Brian Zuniga.

103
00:09:08,728 --> 00:09:11,272
Broken by an anonymous podcaster,

104
00:09:11,272 --> 00:09:12,899
known only as "Your Girl, V",

105
00:09:12,899 --> 00:09:14,609
news of the tragedy

106
00:09:14,634 --> 00:09:17,678
that has befallen the
quiet town of San Lucas

107
00:09:17,795 --> 00:09:20,965
and its prestigious Potenciana University

108
00:09:20,990 --> 00:09:23,767
has gained overnight national attention.

109
00:09:30,040 --> 00:09:31,260
Here is a statement,

110
00:09:31,285 --> 00:09:33,579
from Congressman Ramon Zuniga,

111
00:09:33,604 --> 00:09:36,273
brother of the suspect, Brian Zuniga.

112
00:09:36,298 --> 00:09:39,843
I ask my fellow residents of San Lucas,

113
00:09:40,249 --> 00:09:43,503
and all my colleagues
at Potenciana, to respect

114
00:09:43,769 --> 00:09:45,562
my brother's memory.

115
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:47,081
And to please

116
00:09:47,462 --> 00:09:49,381
trust the justice system...

117
00:09:49,657 --> 00:09:51,951
in finding the real culprit.

118
00:09:53,834 --> 00:09:55,461
Agent Abueva...

119
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:58,935
is she the reason why
the director asked us here?

120
00:10:00,671 --> 00:10:03,352
Get access to the CCTV
footage of the whole area.

121
00:10:05,704 --> 00:10:07,497
The thing is...

122
00:10:07,683 --> 00:10:09,935
that building's too old.

123
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,838
The wiring's faulty and so is the camera.

124
00:10:13,395 --> 00:10:15,522
Was it faulty? Or cut?

125
00:10:17,363 --> 00:10:19,782
Do you really think that?

126
00:10:20,733 --> 00:10:22,318
The case is closed.

127
00:10:22,528 --> 00:10:25,489
Brian has confessed...

128
00:10:25,514 --> 00:10:27,641
and I'm sure when the DNA test is done,

129
00:10:28,152 --> 00:10:31,197
it'll match the blood
stains on Hannah's fingers.

130
00:10:31,561 --> 00:10:34,689
Agent Dick, don't let the news
and the internet cloud your judgment.

131
00:10:34,714 --> 00:10:37,091
Brian and Hannah were in a relationship.

132
00:10:37,116 --> 00:10:41,036
During their sexual act,
Hannah could've scratched Brian.

133
00:10:41,871 --> 00:10:43,122
Just look at this...

134
00:10:43,147 --> 00:10:45,357
there's a lot of entry
and exit points here.

135
00:10:45,547 --> 00:10:47,174
There's a lot of hiding spots

136
00:10:48,352 --> 00:10:51,021
for a possible third party last night.

137
00:10:51,156 --> 00:10:53,325
Are you saying there's
a killer at Potenciana?

138
00:10:55,401 --> 00:10:58,904
Let's not jump to conclusions
Agent Dick, and just do our job.

139
00:10:58,929 --> 00:11:01,723
Call for everyone who
attended the party last night.

140
00:11:04,383 --> 00:11:06,593
Ma'am, I just got a text from Teodoro

141
00:11:06,732 --> 00:11:10,152
He's on his way and the
students are ready upstairs.

142
00:11:11,585 --> 00:11:13,379
Miss Arceo,

143
00:11:13,404 --> 00:11:16,657
Brian and I share one
class in creative writing

144
00:11:16,682 --> 00:11:18,726
and we're not even friends.

145
00:11:19,371 --> 00:11:20,873
At this point Gab,

146
00:11:20,898 --> 00:11:24,443
they're talking to everyone
connected to Brian

147
00:11:24,698 --> 00:11:27,617
and everyone at the
main building last night.

148
00:11:27,726 --> 00:11:29,728
They even talked to me!

149
00:11:32,901 --> 00:11:35,028
Just answer them directly.

150
00:11:35,635 --> 00:11:37,178
Be honest.

151
00:11:42,004 --> 00:11:43,524
Gab...

152
00:11:46,964 --> 00:11:48,966
I'm done...

153
00:11:50,580 --> 00:11:52,582
Calm down, Chloe.

154
00:11:52,762 --> 00:11:54,764
I understand your pain.

155
00:11:54,892 --> 00:11:57,811
You’re the first one
who saw Brian last night.

156
00:11:59,005 --> 00:12:00,840
You know what, I suggest...

157
00:12:00,865 --> 00:12:02,409
that you go home.

158
00:12:02,759 --> 00:12:04,052
And I'll make sure,

159
00:12:04,077 --> 00:12:07,122
you'll get your proper
trauma counseling, okay?

160
00:12:07,201 --> 00:12:08,452
Okay.

161
00:12:08,484 --> 00:12:11,987
Agent Abueva, please take care of Gab.

162
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,828
Miss San Andres, I'm Agent Abueva.

163
00:12:44,400 --> 00:12:46,068
Miss San Andres?

164
00:12:57,406 --> 00:12:59,575
Brian and I were group mates

165
00:12:59,751 --> 00:13:02,212
and we're working on a thesis.

166
00:13:02,616 --> 00:13:05,535
That's why we're always together.

167
00:13:05,941 --> 00:13:10,071
I think that's enough reason
for Hannah to be jealous of me.

168
00:13:11,623 --> 00:13:14,125
And you have no ill feelings with Hannah?

169
00:13:15,021 --> 00:13:17,566
Weren't you fighting over a certain video?

170
00:13:19,745 --> 00:13:22,164
Ma'am, I think you'd agree

171
00:13:22,271 --> 00:13:26,317
that a drunk video taken without
your knowledge would anger you.

172
00:13:27,802 --> 00:13:29,512
Besides...

173
00:13:29,957 --> 00:13:32,752
they're not really my friends!

174
00:13:32,929 --> 00:13:35,182
I'm not a party girl...

175
00:13:35,207 --> 00:13:36,375
unlike...

176
00:13:36,485 --> 00:13:39,238
Sam, Molly, and Hannah...

177
00:13:40,267 --> 00:13:43,145
they just like to force their shit on me.

178
00:13:47,084 --> 00:13:50,630
The barristers' night started at 7PM.

179
00:13:50,655 --> 00:13:55,118
At approximately 10PM, Brian
Zuniga fell from the main building.

180
00:13:55,143 --> 00:13:56,602
I've already told you earlier

181
00:13:56,847 --> 00:14:00,058
I was with Chloe that fucking night.

182
00:14:05,111 --> 00:14:07,822
- Babe, why are we here?
- Shh...

183
00:14:11,283 --> 00:14:14,870
- Someone might see us here!
- Shh...No, there's no CCTV.

184
00:14:15,306 --> 00:14:16,766
Yeah but...

185
00:14:19,283 --> 00:14:22,495
Shit...Baby can we just go
back to the party, please?

186
00:14:24,601 --> 00:14:26,811
Baby...

187
00:14:26,836 --> 00:14:29,673
I am the party.

188
00:15:58,299 --> 00:16:01,576
Submit me, coach...

189
00:16:04,785 --> 00:16:06,326
Jiggy!

190
00:16:08,968 --> 00:16:10,850
What are you doing?

191
00:16:11,745 --> 00:16:13,497
What the hell?

192
00:16:13,522 --> 00:16:15,149
Babe!

193
00:16:19,434 --> 00:16:21,895
Did you really stay at the bonfire area?

194
00:16:22,219 --> 00:16:24,263
Can I get some coffee?

195
00:16:25,359 --> 00:16:27,872
For the nerves, you know?

196
00:17:17,153 --> 00:17:19,066
- Hello?
- Dude, are you sure

197
00:17:19,091 --> 00:17:20,923
- Stay right there.
- with what you're doing?

198
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:22,449
What?

199
00:17:22,474 --> 00:17:24,106
Fuck!

200
00:17:24,617 --> 00:17:26,368
Don't worry about it.

201
00:17:26,762 --> 00:17:28,514
I won't fuck it up.

202
00:17:37,589 --> 00:17:40,633
I was at the garden all night

203
00:17:41,541 --> 00:17:43,000
Hello, bro?

204
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:46,811
Hello? Where are you?

205
00:17:48,382 --> 00:17:53,429
Emerson, I'll tell you
about it once I'm done.

206
00:17:59,288 --> 00:18:01,790
And as team captain,

207
00:18:01,815 --> 00:18:03,733
it's my responsibility

208
00:18:03,758 --> 00:18:08,137
to keep my members in check that night.

209
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:12,180
And coach asked me to keep an eye on them.

210
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:14,793
Actually...

211
00:18:14,867 --> 00:18:17,620
I'm not really updated on
Bri's private life anymore.

212
00:18:17,645 --> 00:18:21,107
Especially when I started
training Taekwondo.

213
00:18:22,693 --> 00:18:25,779
It was… as far as I remember,

214
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:28,741
he had a huge fight with Hannah.

215
00:18:28,766 --> 00:18:32,103
If you and Brian treat
each other like brothers...

216
00:18:32,504 --> 00:18:37,175
then you probably know
what they were fighting about.

217
00:18:46,597 --> 00:18:48,850
I believe...uhm...

218
00:18:48,875 --> 00:18:51,002
Hannah was jealous of...

219
00:18:51,027 --> 00:18:53,446
Gab San Andres?

220
00:18:53,651 --> 00:18:56,477
It's that fucking San Andres.

221
00:18:57,186 --> 00:18:59,313
It's Gab San Andres.

222
00:18:59,338 --> 00:19:01,273
Perhaps there's another reason why

223
00:19:01,298 --> 00:19:04,384
Brian's friends keep on saying your name.

224
00:19:07,657 --> 00:19:10,284
Maybe he said something
about having feelings for you?

225
00:19:10,997 --> 00:19:13,374
Maybe Hannah knew about it?

226
00:19:16,533 --> 00:19:19,453
You think Brian has feelings for me?

227
00:19:20,879 --> 00:19:22,422
I doubt it.

228
00:19:22,733 --> 00:19:24,610
That's not possible.

229
00:19:24,635 --> 00:19:26,345
And how so?

230
00:19:26,370 --> 00:19:27,747
Ma'am...

231
00:19:27,983 --> 00:19:29,735
the Zuniga Hall,

232
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:31,637
the Galman library,

233
00:19:32,153 --> 00:19:34,114
the Valles complex,

234
00:19:34,139 --> 00:19:35,766
and the Guico gym,

235
00:19:35,791 --> 00:19:38,668
they had all those built.

236
00:19:38,693 --> 00:19:39,736
In short,

237
00:19:39,761 --> 00:19:42,430
they practically own Potenciana.

238
00:19:43,291 --> 00:19:45,502
And I'm just a scholar here

239
00:19:46,663 --> 00:19:49,666
He'd never fall for someone like me

240
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:51,767
My apologies, jerk!

241
00:21:02,456 --> 00:21:04,104
Excuse me...

242
00:21:04,104 --> 00:21:06,073
Do you know where Zuniga Hall is?

243
00:21:08,674 --> 00:21:12,671
Oh my god, look at her face!
I know right?

244
00:21:12,696 --> 00:21:14,488
Is anything wrong?

245
00:21:14,511 --> 00:21:15,791
It's very easy.

246
00:21:20,711 --> 00:21:22,130
How much?

247
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:25,575
150 for the ham, 180 for the bacon.

248
00:21:34,259 --> 00:21:36,804
I'll buy one...tomorrow.

249
00:21:38,331 --> 00:21:39,787
Miss! Miss!

250
00:21:39,812 --> 00:21:42,964
You might wanna join.
Thank you!

251
00:21:44,339 --> 00:21:46,532
Can I call you Gab?

252
00:21:47,848 --> 00:21:51,519
Is there something wrong
with my sample story?

253
00:21:51,544 --> 00:21:53,597
Well from our e-mails,

254
00:21:53,622 --> 00:21:55,916
we asked you to write about

255
00:21:55,941 --> 00:21:59,277
the Bulb Music Festival
for your try out piece.

256
00:21:59,751 --> 00:22:02,129
Right?
Mhmm...

257
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:03,322
Yeah...

258
00:22:03,347 --> 00:22:08,644
not this exposé on the smuggling
on the port of San Lucas.

259
00:22:09,542 --> 00:22:12,587
Isn't that more interesting?

260
00:22:12,612 --> 00:22:15,489
Uhm...since Zuniga shipping is involved

261
00:22:15,514 --> 00:22:20,394
and we all know the Zuniga family
is on Potenciana's board, right?

262
00:22:20,599 --> 00:22:22,143
Exactly!

263
00:22:22,336 --> 00:22:24,463
We don't want to ruffle any feathers.

264
00:22:25,055 --> 00:22:27,057
- Right?
- Mhmm...

265
00:22:27,575 --> 00:22:30,411
this is still so serious.

266
00:22:31,171 --> 00:22:33,423
We need a feature writer

267
00:22:33,448 --> 00:22:35,229
not a wannabe reporter.

268
00:22:35,362 --> 00:22:36,739
Get it?

269
00:22:38,360 --> 00:22:40,487
- Got it.
- Okay, okay.

270
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:43,473
I'll give you another
chance to write for us.

271
00:22:46,560 --> 00:22:52,316
How about the latest Enriquez
installation in the Gallery Chelo?

272
00:22:52,408 --> 00:22:53,534
Have you seen it?

273
00:22:53,800 --> 00:22:56,594
Actually...no.

274
00:22:56,722 --> 00:22:57,890
I see.

275
00:23:02,584 --> 00:23:03,669
Okay!

276
00:23:09,675 --> 00:23:11,510
If you don't want me...

277
00:23:11,979 --> 00:23:13,690
then I don't want you either.

278
00:23:19,357 --> 00:23:21,108
Hi...?

279
00:23:21,640 --> 00:23:23,517
Hi!

280
00:23:26,564 --> 00:23:30,026
Welcome...to...Truth Talks! With Gab.

281
00:23:30,227 --> 00:23:33,982
And this is our very first episode so...

282
00:23:34,007 --> 00:23:35,729
I hope this doesn't flop.

283
00:23:40,956 --> 00:23:43,667
This just in!

284
00:23:43,803 --> 00:23:46,305
A staff under Zuniga shipping

285
00:23:46,330 --> 00:23:48,499
was caught involved-

286
00:23:48,524 --> 00:23:51,292
A staff from Zuniga
shipping was caught involved

287
00:23:51,317 --> 00:23:53,402
in a smuggling incident of high-end cars.

288
00:23:53,427 --> 00:23:56,555
These are cars like Ferrari, and more.

289
00:24:00,182 --> 00:24:02,650
And from what I hear...

290
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,636
you tip off the customs yourselves

291
00:24:05,661 --> 00:24:07,714
so you can buy it back through biddings.

292
00:24:08,422 --> 00:24:10,048
What a great MO, isn't it?

293
00:24:10,073 --> 00:24:13,451
This staff member is already in hiding.

294
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:16,224
Does the Zuniga family
know about his side gig?

295
00:24:16,249 --> 00:24:18,376
Or maybe...

296
00:24:18,401 --> 00:24:20,862
this is where the Potenciana
donations are from.

297
00:24:20,887 --> 00:24:23,120
For more details, tune in here

298
00:24:23,145 --> 00:24:25,439
at Truth Talks with Gab.

299
00:24:33,588 --> 00:24:36,181
Hey look it's FLOPcast.

300
00:24:52,696 --> 00:24:54,114
Psst.

301
00:24:55,740 --> 00:24:57,617
- Psst.
- Call me flopcast again-

302
00:24:57,642 --> 00:24:58,727
Easy!

303
00:24:58,752 --> 00:25:01,296
Gab, right?

304
00:25:02,387 --> 00:25:04,723
Truth Talks with Gab, am I right?

305
00:25:05,976 --> 00:25:07,186
You've seen it?

306
00:25:08,001 --> 00:25:09,581
Til the end.

307
00:25:12,339 --> 00:25:15,217
You're BZ77?

308
00:25:18,429 --> 00:25:22,099
Brian Zuniga, number
77 in our basketball team

309
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,190
Nice to meet you.

310
00:25:24,394 --> 00:25:27,272
- We've met at the bar.
- I know.

311
00:25:28,585 --> 00:25:30,212
Zuniga?

312
00:25:31,108 --> 00:25:33,694
Zuniga Shipping and Zuniga Hall?

313
00:25:33,719 --> 00:25:34,784
Yup!

314
00:25:36,574 --> 00:25:38,243
What's this?

315
00:25:38,331 --> 00:25:39,791
Is this supposed to be a prank?

316
00:25:39,816 --> 00:25:41,745
- Wow.
- And you're happy about it?

317
00:25:42,445 --> 00:25:44,495
The exposé was about you.

318
00:25:44,520 --> 00:25:46,689
Well there wasn’t anything wrong about it.

319
00:25:46,714 --> 00:25:48,215
It was all true.

320
00:25:48,656 --> 00:25:50,574
Actually, the staff member was caught.

321
00:25:50,599 --> 00:25:51,892
The one you were referring to,

322
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:54,711
he's been fired from our company already.

323
00:25:56,545 --> 00:25:59,214
Besides, I find your delivery

324
00:25:59,239 --> 00:26:02,200
so passionate. I like that.

325
00:26:04,749 --> 00:26:07,166
Although, you didn't
highlight your beauty very well.

326
00:26:07,825 --> 00:26:09,743
Maybe you can...

327
00:26:10,363 --> 00:26:12,574
work on better lighting?

328
00:26:12,599 --> 00:26:14,726
Or...make up would help.

329
00:26:15,644 --> 00:26:17,229
Oh really?

330
00:26:17,442 --> 00:26:19,861
Then go ahead and make your own podcast.

331
00:26:19,886 --> 00:26:22,352
- Woah.
- What a meddler.

332
00:26:22,377 --> 00:26:24,128
I have a correction to make.

333
00:26:24,153 --> 00:26:26,943
I'm not into Ferrari cars,

334
00:26:26,968 --> 00:26:29,925
I'm more of an SUV guy, just to be clear.

335
00:26:40,386 --> 00:26:42,317
Hi classmates!

336
00:27:19,187 --> 00:27:21,378
Excuse...excuse me.

337
00:27:23,659 --> 00:27:26,386
So what are your plans, bro?

338
00:27:26,731 --> 00:27:29,401
How many dates have you had with Hannah?

339
00:27:29,426 --> 00:27:32,137
The whole school already
thinks she's your girlfriend.

340
00:27:32,404 --> 00:27:33,822
I know right?

341
00:27:33,847 --> 00:27:36,432
We went on a few dates but, I don't know...

342
00:27:40,274 --> 00:27:43,778
Hey Brian! Look! You're the top student!

343
00:27:43,964 --> 00:27:45,424
I got the top spot, bro!

344
00:27:45,449 --> 00:27:48,118
- Can I see?
- Hey make way!

345
00:27:48,143 --> 00:27:50,103
- You're blocking it.
- Oh wow!

346
00:27:50,128 --> 00:27:52,863
I'm the top student, bro!

347
00:27:52,888 --> 00:27:55,682
- Congrats bro, congrats!
- Thanks, guys!

348
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:58,636
I'm on 8th place! How 'bout you?

349
00:27:59,178 --> 00:28:01,972
You're so proud of being
the top student, aren't you?

350
00:28:02,868 --> 00:28:06,518
I saw all your exams and quiz papers...

351
00:28:07,178 --> 00:28:09,138
it's all blank.

352
00:28:09,530 --> 00:28:11,323
Now you're at the top?

353
00:28:11,603 --> 00:28:14,272
So? Why are you asking me?

354
00:28:14,297 --> 00:28:16,007
Did I write those grades?

355
00:28:17,527 --> 00:28:22,240
Whatever shit you're
doing, Mr. Brian Zuniga...

356
00:28:22,873 --> 00:28:24,959
I will expose you.

357
00:28:26,229 --> 00:28:27,939
Now wait a minute...

358
00:28:27,964 --> 00:28:30,550
What's your problem, anyway?
You're still on the top list.

359
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,244
This isn't about me!

360
00:28:32,411 --> 00:28:34,956
It's about fairness.

361
00:28:36,032 --> 00:28:39,202
So whatever shit you're doing...

362
00:28:39,588 --> 00:28:41,131
I'll find out.

363
00:28:41,815 --> 00:28:43,275
Go ahead!

364
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,370
- You're top 10?
- You're 11.

365
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,441
Okay, for our next pairing we have...

366
00:28:57,533 --> 00:28:59,660
Gab San Andres...

367
00:28:59,940 --> 00:29:01,233
...and...

368
00:29:03,078 --> 00:29:04,871
Brian Zuniga.

369
00:29:41,749 --> 00:29:44,995
Oh no! Oh shit. Shit, shit shit!

370
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:49,045
What happened?

371
00:29:52,323 --> 00:29:53,866
Gab!

372
00:29:55,607 --> 00:29:57,109
I'm sorry I'm late.

373
00:29:57,239 --> 00:30:00,034
I had to attend
basketball practice earlier,

374
00:30:00,450 --> 00:30:01,784
I'm sorry.

375
00:30:03,750 --> 00:30:06,169
You can go fuck yourself.

376
00:30:07,876 --> 00:30:10,879
I can offer you a ride...
let me make it up to you.

377
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:14,795
You know what...

378
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:17,322
that's the problem with you rich people.

379
00:30:17,610 --> 00:30:20,447
You think the whole
world revolves around you.

380
00:30:20,472 --> 00:30:23,559
You think you can get everything you want.

381
00:30:24,297 --> 00:30:26,967
Well, you're wrong, Gab.

382
00:30:27,541 --> 00:30:30,752
And I think you should get to
know me first before judging me.

383
00:30:30,777 --> 00:30:32,779
No, not interested.

384
00:30:33,593 --> 00:30:38,261
And tomorrow, I'll be
requesting for a new thesis parter.

385
00:30:38,754 --> 00:30:41,674
Gab, please. I'm really, really sorry.

386
00:30:42,044 --> 00:30:44,463
Can you at least accept my help?

387
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:48,625
I mean, how are you gonna
get home in your broken bicycle?

388
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:52,111
See? It's about to rain,
how are you getting home?

389
00:30:52,136 --> 00:30:53,679
So, come on...

390
00:30:54,616 --> 00:30:57,035
We can bring this in the car. Come on.

391
00:30:57,069 --> 00:30:59,697
- I said no.
- Let's go, come on.

392
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,518
- Go!
- Will it fit there?

393
00:31:06,125 --> 00:31:10,671
Gab, I'm really, really sorry.
I'll make it up to you, I promise.

394
00:31:11,868 --> 00:31:14,424
If my bike was fine, I wouldn't be here.

395
00:31:15,490 --> 00:31:17,659
That is if...

396
00:31:17,684 --> 00:31:20,228
I can still change your mind

397
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,506
to take me again as your thesis partner.

398
00:31:24,602 --> 00:31:26,081
I have a question for you.

399
00:31:26,106 --> 00:31:27,190
Yes?

400
00:31:27,215 --> 00:31:30,135
Chloe told me that for every group work,

401
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:33,538
you pay your group mates to do your part.

402
00:31:34,851 --> 00:31:37,353
Couldn't you just pay me too?

403
00:31:38,289 --> 00:31:39,708
Well...

404
00:31:40,047 --> 00:31:42,257
I know you're not like them.

405
00:31:42,995 --> 00:31:45,688
And I'm sure you wouldn't want that.

406
00:31:45,713 --> 00:31:48,139
After everything you've shouted at me

407
00:31:48,164 --> 00:31:50,083
and that challenge in the hallway...

408
00:31:50,108 --> 00:31:53,361
a part of me wants to prove myself to you.

409
00:31:53,487 --> 00:31:55,197
So, please...

410
00:31:57,098 --> 00:31:58,141
Gab...

411
00:31:58,532 --> 00:31:59,741
I'm sorry.

412
00:32:12,774 --> 00:32:15,110
Where is he now...

413
00:32:18,535 --> 00:32:20,355
Section 13... I think this is it...

414
00:32:23,124 --> 00:32:25,159
Why isn't he here yet?

415
00:32:25,184 --> 00:32:27,728
I'm doing it by myself agai-
Waiting for someone?

416
00:32:30,730 --> 00:32:32,425
Let me bring this, okay?

417
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:38,135
Okay...let's go?

418
00:32:41,694 --> 00:32:44,690
Partner... let's go.

419
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:46,008
Alright.

420
00:32:50,226 --> 00:32:54,606
- Here's the next chapter, go ahead.
- You're supposed to do...

421
00:32:54,631 --> 00:32:56,775
What's that supposed
to be? Why is it blank?

422
00:32:56,800 --> 00:32:58,802
Well I'm still trying to teach you.

423
00:32:58,827 --> 00:33:02,789
But you're the one who
doesn't know anything.

424
00:33:07,368 --> 00:33:08,912
Hey!

425
00:33:09,468 --> 00:33:11,553
Are you drunk?

426
00:33:13,599 --> 00:33:15,559
Alright, alright.

427
00:33:32,018 --> 00:33:34,187
- See? It's the same!
- Okay!

428
00:33:34,212 --> 00:33:37,033
Good job!

429
00:33:44,611 --> 00:33:45,847
Hey Gab...

430
00:33:45,872 --> 00:33:48,041
Before you go, I have something for you.

431
00:33:48,066 --> 00:33:49,192
Hold on...

432
00:33:50,248 --> 00:33:53,960
I know your podcasting
is very important so...

433
00:33:54,678 --> 00:33:56,514
I hope this can help.

434
00:33:58,180 --> 00:34:00,724
- Ring light?
- Yes.

435
00:34:01,729 --> 00:34:03,731
Do I look that bad?

436
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:07,340
Not at all!

437
00:34:07,699 --> 00:34:09,743
I find you very beautiful...

438
00:34:10,898 --> 00:34:13,681
No, seriously. I think you're gorgeous.

439
00:34:14,997 --> 00:34:17,332
So when you use that...

440
00:34:17,357 --> 00:34:19,642
I get to see your pretty face better.

441
00:34:26,275 --> 00:34:27,422
Right?

442
00:34:29,276 --> 00:34:30,806
Especially...

443
00:34:32,464 --> 00:34:35,533
your cute little nose...

444
00:34:43,840 --> 00:34:46,197
your tender lips.

445
00:35:08,476 --> 00:35:10,311
Are you okay?

446
00:35:10,903 --> 00:35:13,595
- Uhm...
- You okay, Gab?

447
00:35:15,684 --> 00:35:17,936
This is wrong. Don't you have a girlfriend?

448
00:35:17,961 --> 00:35:19,630
How about Hannah then?

449
00:35:19,793 --> 00:35:21,336
What about Hannah?

450
00:35:21,578 --> 00:35:23,330
Who says we're together?

451
00:35:23,355 --> 00:35:25,441
No, she's not my girlfriend.

452
00:35:26,257 --> 00:35:28,301
We've just dated a few times.

453
00:35:30,263 --> 00:35:32,474
Sam and Molly...

454
00:35:32,779 --> 00:35:36,032
and everyone at school think so.

455
00:35:37,190 --> 00:35:40,485
The way Hannah clings
to you makes it obvious.

456
00:35:40,510 --> 00:35:41,970
Well...

457
00:35:42,209 --> 00:35:46,213
Gab, they're wrong about Hannah and me.

458
00:35:47,323 --> 00:35:49,501
We're not together...

459
00:35:50,510 --> 00:35:52,345
We're not together.

460
00:35:56,434 --> 00:35:59,312
I don't want Hannah.

461
00:35:59,337 --> 00:36:01,505
I want you, Gab.

462
00:36:02,401 --> 00:36:04,987
I only want you.

463
00:36:07,309 --> 00:36:09,269
Well...

464
00:36:10,341 --> 00:36:12,760
I have no interest in being the other woman

465
00:36:13,557 --> 00:36:16,435
and in whatever's going
on between you and Hannah.

466
00:36:17,338 --> 00:36:19,533
I don't want to get caught up in it.

467
00:36:20,087 --> 00:36:21,413
Okay...

468
00:36:23,077 --> 00:36:25,208
but you kissed me back.

469
00:36:29,315 --> 00:36:33,133
Does that mean if I
clear things with Hannah,

470
00:36:34,427 --> 00:36:37,262
will you give us a chance?

471
00:36:44,686 --> 00:36:46,605
If you can fix it...

472
00:37:01,217 --> 00:37:02,564
Good night, Gab!

473
00:37:19,428 --> 00:37:23,209
What happened, Hannah?
Did Brian break up with you?

474
00:37:23,428 --> 00:37:24,804
Worse!

475
00:37:25,679 --> 00:37:27,556
He says we were never a couple

476
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,748
and that he wanted to clear it out with me.

477
00:37:34,898 --> 00:37:36,859
What do you mean?

478
00:37:36,884 --> 00:37:40,131
But...I thought you've had sex already.

479
00:37:42,104 --> 00:37:44,569
I tried to initiate it so many times...

480
00:37:47,015 --> 00:37:48,558
we'll make out...

481
00:37:49,632 --> 00:37:51,842
we've reached second base but that's it!

482
00:37:52,557 --> 00:37:54,768
I don't get him!

483
00:37:55,365 --> 00:37:57,185
Me neither!

484
00:37:57,210 --> 00:37:59,748
Girl, you're like so hot.

485
00:37:59,773 --> 00:38:02,025
How can he resist you?

486
00:38:02,411 --> 00:38:05,372
Not unless he's gay

487
00:38:05,397 --> 00:38:06,732
or...

488
00:38:07,199 --> 00:38:08,670
there's a third party.

489
00:38:08,901 --> 00:38:12,697
I heard you've been spotted
at the business district...

490
00:38:13,416 --> 00:38:17,553
Perhaps there's a sugar
daddy we don't know about?

491
00:38:18,648 --> 00:38:21,150
I don't have another man...

492
00:38:22,661 --> 00:38:24,955
and I don't go anywhere else...

493
00:38:27,508 --> 00:38:30,553
I only want Brian!!!

494
00:38:33,546 --> 00:38:36,951
And when I find the woman who stole him...

495
00:38:36,976 --> 00:38:39,977
I'll make sure to break her face!

496
00:38:40,002 --> 00:38:42,560
Oh my god Hannah you're bleeding!

497
00:38:44,673 --> 00:38:47,801
- Let's go...
- Let's go Hannah.

498
00:39:05,059 --> 00:39:07,028
I know what you did, Bri...

499
00:39:08,195 --> 00:39:10,614
I know you've broken
things off with Hannah.

500
00:39:14,277 --> 00:39:16,404
I feel bad, and guilty because,

501
00:39:18,291 --> 00:39:21,210
I know I'm the reason for her pain.

502
00:39:21,235 --> 00:39:22,445
I understand.

503
00:39:27,877 --> 00:39:29,086
Look,

504
00:39:30,443 --> 00:39:32,472
Hannah and I weren't really a thing, Gab...

505
00:39:34,174 --> 00:39:37,219
For me, we were just
getting to know each other.

506
00:39:37,609 --> 00:39:39,356
She felt otherwise.

507
00:39:43,386 --> 00:39:46,208
That's exactly what I mean, Bri...

508
00:39:57,153 --> 00:39:59,130
I feel like...

509
00:40:00,620 --> 00:40:03,415
I took you from her because I know...

510
00:40:03,931 --> 00:40:05,595
I know she loves you.

511
00:40:11,091 --> 00:40:12,129
Gab...

512
00:40:14,404 --> 00:40:16,397
I don't love Hannah...

513
00:40:18,502 --> 00:40:19,651
Okay?

514
00:40:21,039 --> 00:40:22,916
I never said I did.

515
00:40:23,948 --> 00:40:25,532
I never felt it.

516
00:40:27,626 --> 00:40:29,077
But with you...

517
00:40:30,811 --> 00:40:32,413
I am sure.

518
00:40:36,359 --> 00:40:39,587
Gab I don't wanna hide
my feelings for you anymore.

519
00:40:43,585 --> 00:40:46,671
I want us to have a clean slate.

520
00:40:48,936 --> 00:40:50,403
Let's start anew...

521
00:40:54,030 --> 00:40:55,293
Gab, I love you.

522
00:41:00,797 --> 00:41:02,028
I love you.

523
00:42:34,230 --> 00:42:35,230
It's okay.

524
00:44:03,437 --> 00:44:05,342
I love you, Gab.

525
00:44:09,101 --> 00:44:10,663
I love you, Brian.

526
00:44:24,622 --> 00:44:26,458
Fuck you, Brian!

527
00:44:30,230 --> 00:44:32,899
I saw Hannah kiss you in the library.

528
00:44:33,638 --> 00:44:35,765
- What?
- Are you denying it?

529
00:44:36,665 --> 00:44:38,708
I saw it!

530
00:44:44,164 --> 00:44:46,458
I didn't want it to happen, Gab.

531
00:44:46,991 --> 00:44:49,410
Seriously? You're lying!

532
00:44:49,912 --> 00:44:51,830
Didn't you kiss her too?!

533
00:44:51,965 --> 00:44:53,467
I had to do it!

534
00:44:53,831 --> 00:44:55,667
I had to make her believe...

535
00:44:55,692 --> 00:44:57,577
Believe what? What are you talking about?

536
00:44:57,602 --> 00:45:00,521
You wanna make her
believe you love her too?

537
00:45:00,546 --> 00:45:02,590
The way you made me believe you?

538
00:45:03,439 --> 00:45:04,732
For what?

539
00:45:04,757 --> 00:45:07,713
- So you can cheat on both of us!
- Please, Gab...

540
00:45:09,929 --> 00:45:12,307
I'm not even sleeping with her.

541
00:45:12,888 --> 00:45:14,717
I'm not cheating on you.

542
00:45:19,525 --> 00:45:22,778
She's keeping something from me
and I need to find out what it is.

543
00:45:24,853 --> 00:45:26,396
So please...

544
00:45:28,080 --> 00:45:30,291
Hiding what? What are you talking about?

545
00:45:43,833 --> 00:45:49,713
There's still a lot of unanswered
questions, my virgins and freaks.

546
00:45:49,878 --> 00:45:52,839
Why are you really
here? Is it to help Brian?

547
00:45:52,864 --> 00:45:55,116
Or help Marion?

548
00:45:55,144 --> 00:45:57,563
Do you think they got the joke?

549
00:45:58,165 --> 00:46:01,210
About the door?
