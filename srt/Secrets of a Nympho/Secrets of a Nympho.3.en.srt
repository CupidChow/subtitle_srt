00:00:13,815 --> 00:00:15,557
Hello, virgins and freaks.

2
00:00:17,998 --> 00:00:20,644
I know you're all
waiting for the latest tea

3
00:00:20,669 --> 00:00:23,073
from our Potenciana murder and rape case.

4
00:00:24,531 --> 00:00:26,408
If the knockers are real,

5
00:00:26,433 --> 00:00:28,226
who are they?

6
00:00:32,157 --> 00:00:35,118
Have you heard of V's podcast?

7
00:00:35,785 --> 00:00:37,579
I just want to know,

8
00:00:38,121 --> 00:00:39,581
is it you?

9
00:01:14,918 --> 00:01:17,170
Is this what you want?

10
00:04:02,492 --> 00:04:03,568
Hello.

11
00:04:04,369 --> 00:04:05,428
It's done.

12
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,667
It's over.

13
00:04:14,545 --> 00:04:16,547
Fuck you, Hannah.

14
00:04:48,203 --> 00:04:51,790
Is there nobody here?! Here we go. Dude,

15
00:04:52,018 --> 00:04:54,520
open my tab, okay?

16
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,352
Okay, listen up everyone!

17
00:04:57,602 --> 00:04:59,312
Because I love you guys,

18
00:04:59,437 --> 00:05:00,981
Yeah! All of you!

19
00:05:01,189 --> 00:05:03,733
Shots on me! Let's go!!!

20
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:11,158
Cheers!

21
00:05:30,677 --> 00:05:33,722
Why would Jiggy clean Hannah's condo?

22
00:05:33,805 --> 00:05:36,308
Was he the last guy who was there?

23
00:05:36,391 --> 00:05:37,559
Why not, right?

24
00:05:37,642 --> 00:05:40,812
It's possible that Hannah
and Jiggy had a relationship.

25
00:05:54,910 --> 00:05:57,162
So is there another person?

26
00:05:57,579 --> 00:06:01,082
If these two people
targeted Brian and Hannah,

27
00:06:01,541 --> 00:06:03,501
then it must have been planned.

28
00:06:04,085 --> 00:06:06,129
That's why their actions are so precise.

29
00:06:06,213 --> 00:06:08,632
They didn't leave a trace at all.

30
00:06:09,049 --> 00:06:10,926
Ladies!

31
00:06:13,261 --> 00:06:15,180
Do you wanna go out?

32
00:06:15,513 --> 00:06:17,265
With the two of us?

33
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,559
I'm really, really sorry.

34
00:06:19,976 --> 00:06:22,562
But I don't do hags.

35
00:06:23,230 --> 00:06:24,731
Man, another round.

36
00:06:25,357 --> 00:06:27,943
Are you sure, sir?
This is your fifth round.

37
00:06:28,485 --> 00:06:31,529
I don't care. I just
want everyone to drink,

38
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:34,407
and maybe give these two...

39
00:06:34,574 --> 00:06:36,284
hags, some drinks too.

40
00:06:36,493 --> 00:06:38,662
Thanks, but no thanks.

41
00:06:40,372 --> 00:06:42,791
Yeah, right.

42
00:06:47,212 --> 00:06:48,755
Sir.

43
00:07:17,951 --> 00:07:20,662
So it seems like...

44
00:07:21,204 --> 00:07:25,208
Potenciana's star varsity
player isn't just into sports,

45
00:07:25,375 --> 00:07:28,128
but he's into covering up crimes too.

46
00:07:28,586 --> 00:07:31,089
According to our source,

47
00:07:31,214 --> 00:07:34,843
Taekwondo team's main man, Jiggy Galman,

48
00:07:34,968 --> 00:07:38,096
is in a secret relationship with Hannah.

49
00:07:38,513 --> 00:07:40,640
What the hell are they talking about?

50
00:07:40,974 --> 00:07:42,475
But wait...

51
00:07:42,809 --> 00:07:44,477
there's more.

52
00:07:45,478 --> 00:07:49,065
Jiggy isn't the only man...

53
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:52,569
in Hannah's room.

54
00:07:54,112 --> 00:07:56,781
We can't confirm who this is yet.

55
00:07:57,907 --> 00:07:59,409
Members of

56
00:07:59,443 --> 00:08:02,905
- the Taekwondo team, perhaps?
- Fuck.

57
00:08:04,914 --> 00:08:08,293
Fuck!!!

58
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:18,762
If you have some insights,

59
00:08:18,845 --> 00:08:21,848
our comment section is open.

60
00:08:22,515 --> 00:08:24,184
And of course,

61
00:08:24,476 --> 00:08:26,269
they will deny this.

62
00:08:26,394 --> 00:08:30,106
Of course, they will say I'm a liar.

63
00:08:30,482 --> 00:08:33,026
But I have proof.

64
00:08:33,485 --> 00:08:34,652
I have...

65
00:08:34,778 --> 00:08:36,863
a video of Jiggy.

66
00:08:37,072 --> 00:08:38,365
Isn't that him?

67
00:08:38,490 --> 00:08:39,674
The rapist?

68
00:08:39,699 --> 00:08:41,576
Right?

69
00:08:46,039 --> 00:08:48,500
I'm on the right track.

70
00:08:49,125 --> 00:08:51,461
I've got you, Jiggy.

71
00:08:51,546 --> 00:08:54,466
- Rapist!
- Fucking pig!

72
00:09:00,929 --> 00:09:04,349
Mr. Galman, you are
needed at the dean's office.

73
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:05,934
Please follow me.

74
00:09:06,142 --> 00:09:09,020
- Why does he need to see me, ma'am?
- He wants to talk to you.

75
00:09:09,104 --> 00:09:11,147
Come on, I'll walk you to the office.

76
00:09:15,701 --> 00:09:18,162
And if I continue poking the bear...

77
00:09:18,571 --> 00:09:22,033
he'll soon wake up and
come out of his cave.

78
00:09:23,076 --> 00:09:26,204
I will clean your name, Brian.

79
00:09:26,579 --> 00:09:28,581
What's happening here, boys?

80
00:09:29,428 --> 00:09:34,808
Now the Taekwondo team is involved
in Brian and Hannah's incident too?

81
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:38,915
The case is closed. Why
is this still happening?

82
00:09:40,157 --> 00:09:42,076
The team isn't involved.

83
00:09:42,101 --> 00:09:43,644
It's just Jiggy!

84
00:09:44,164 --> 00:09:46,583
I had nothing to do with it.

85
00:09:46,825 --> 00:09:47,951
What the fuck?

86
00:09:47,976 --> 00:09:49,352
Language.

87
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:53,231
Why are you so quick to believe
that podcast anyway?

88
00:09:53,356 --> 00:09:58,111
We don't know who it is,
or what she looks like.

89
00:09:58,236 --> 00:10:00,989
It's not that we believe her,

90
00:10:01,156 --> 00:10:02,907
but she's got followers.

91
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:05,218
And if we do nothing about it,

92
00:10:05,243 --> 00:10:07,704
how are your parents

93
00:10:07,814 --> 00:10:10,166
and the whole Potenciana
University going to take it?

94
00:10:10,206 --> 00:10:12,208
Do you have a relationship with Hannah?

95
00:10:12,500 --> 00:10:13,751
Dean.

96
00:10:13,838 --> 00:10:15,924
Why is my team here?

97
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:18,743
Why didn't anyone inform me about this?

98
00:10:19,238 --> 00:10:20,907
It's just an SOP, coach.

99
00:10:21,234 --> 00:10:22,527
We're just making sure

100
00:10:22,552 --> 00:10:24,596
that none of them are involved.

101
00:10:24,846 --> 00:10:26,097
Dean, please.

102
00:10:26,431 --> 00:10:28,071
Do not insult my boys.

103
00:10:28,099 --> 00:10:30,101
I can vouch for all of them.

104
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:31,786
We're not so sure about Jiggy.

105
00:10:31,811 --> 00:10:33,354
Shut your mouth!

106
00:10:33,855 --> 00:10:35,315
Coach.

107
00:10:35,665 --> 00:10:37,667
Count us out.

108
00:10:37,692 --> 00:10:39,861
This guy is a fucking pig!

109
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:42,825
He's destroying the team's reputation!

110
00:10:42,850 --> 00:10:45,258
- Fuck you, man!
- Hey hey hey!

111
00:10:45,283 --> 00:10:47,452
- Enough.
- Do you want me to suspend you?!

112
00:10:47,535 --> 00:10:49,662
Dean, please.

113
00:10:50,288 --> 00:10:52,248
I can handle my boys, okay?

114
00:10:52,749 --> 00:10:55,460
They're just under a
lot of pressure right now.

115
00:10:56,419 --> 00:10:58,171
Dean.

116
00:10:59,380 --> 00:11:03,051
They always bring
recognition to the university.

117
00:11:03,460 --> 00:11:05,003
Now what?

118
00:11:05,725 --> 00:11:08,311
You accuse them just
because a podcast said so?

119
00:11:08,524 --> 00:11:11,861
Mr. Saenz, every new
information is important.

120
00:11:11,886 --> 00:11:15,014
We must give justice to the right person.

121
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:16,801
Justice?

122
00:11:17,031 --> 00:11:19,033
The case is closed.

123
00:11:19,846 --> 00:11:22,682
These kids should be focusing
on their training right now.

124
00:11:22,987 --> 00:11:24,822
Our match is nearing.

125
00:11:26,699 --> 00:11:28,243
And yet,

126
00:11:28,493 --> 00:11:30,828
you accuse them of being criminals?

127
00:11:30,912 --> 00:11:32,747
No more interrogation.

128
00:11:32,956 --> 00:11:35,333
Dean, Ms. Arceo,

129
00:11:35,809 --> 00:11:38,520
Jiggy's lawyers are
already trying to find this...

130
00:11:38,545 --> 00:11:39,879
Girl, V.

131
00:11:40,018 --> 00:11:42,770
And they are going to make sure
she's lawfully punished.

132
00:11:43,883 --> 00:11:46,553
We will be talking to Jiggy's lawyers.

133
00:11:46,970 --> 00:11:49,973
So we can assist them in case they
need help from the administration.

134
00:11:51,599 --> 00:11:53,685
I think they can handle it.

135
00:11:54,018 --> 00:11:56,062
If there's anything we can do to help,

136
00:11:56,187 --> 00:11:59,232
it's to stay united with
our stand and decisions.

137
00:11:59,941 --> 00:12:01,985
We know who our enemies are.

138
00:12:02,452 --> 00:12:05,747
They're the ones destroying
our beloved university.

139
00:12:06,176 --> 00:12:08,262
We shouldn't be up against each other.

140
00:12:14,351 --> 00:12:15,769
Gab.

141
00:12:16,921 --> 00:12:18,351
What do you think?

142
00:12:19,419 --> 00:12:21,546
Do you believe that Your Girl V?

143
00:12:21,688 --> 00:12:24,524
Because she could be making up stories and

144
00:12:24,549 --> 00:12:26,484
she could be doing this for clout.

145
00:12:28,511 --> 00:12:29,781
I don't know.

146
00:12:31,055 --> 00:12:33,508
But her sources seem verified.

147
00:12:35,059 --> 00:12:36,477
Fuck it.

148
00:12:37,202 --> 00:12:40,623
I cannot believe Jiggy's a murderer.

149
00:12:40,857 --> 00:12:45,403
Like...how did I fall for
a murderer and rapist?

150
00:12:45,575 --> 00:12:49,120
Just leave him, Chloe.
And stay away from him.

151
00:12:49,490 --> 00:12:53,953
And put me on speed dial just in
case you need me, call me immediately.

152
00:12:54,787 --> 00:12:56,914
But I love him Gab.

153
00:12:57,290 --> 00:12:59,876
I'm still conflicted about it.

154
00:13:00,313 --> 00:13:03,570
A part of me knows he's not
capable of doing such a thing.

155
00:13:04,352 --> 00:13:06,327
Chloe, wake up.

156
00:13:06,716 --> 00:13:09,047
Quit being an idiot.

157
00:13:09,969 --> 00:13:12,305
If he can molest Hannah,

158
00:13:12,795 --> 00:13:14,937
and if he can kill Brian...

159
00:13:15,885 --> 00:13:17,762
he can do it to you just as easily.

160
00:13:17,787 --> 00:13:20,915
- He's not-
- Stop it, Chloe.

161
00:13:24,942 --> 00:13:28,029
- Gab...
- Shh...

162
00:13:40,266 --> 00:13:42,185
Fuck Jiggy, man!

163
00:13:42,210 --> 00:13:44,545
Dragging the team into this!

164
00:13:46,631 --> 00:13:48,091
What did you say?

165
00:13:48,456 --> 00:13:49,916
Just 'fess up!

166
00:13:50,168 --> 00:13:52,211
The team isn't for trash like you, asshole.

167
00:13:52,345 --> 00:13:53,888
Are you fucking dumb?

168
00:13:54,197 --> 00:13:56,032
I had nothing to do with it.

169
00:13:56,057 --> 00:13:57,767
Idiot!

170
00:14:02,855 --> 00:14:04,273
Ouch!

171
00:14:05,233 --> 00:14:06,776
Enough! That's enough!

172
00:14:06,943 --> 00:14:09,195
Go ahead, Jiggy! I got this!

173
00:14:09,220 --> 00:14:10,889
Enough, man. Stop.

174
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:27,296
Chloe?

175
00:14:28,416 --> 00:14:29,565
Chloe!

176
00:14:29,590 --> 00:14:31,092
- What?
- Hey! Why are you running away from me?

177
00:14:31,092 --> 00:14:32,844
- You scared me!
- What's going on?

178
00:14:32,869 --> 00:14:35,767
- What are you doing?
- Don't tell me you're in on it too.

179
00:14:37,473 --> 00:14:40,205
Hey, wait! Can we talk?

180
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:45,440
Speak up, seriously.

181
00:14:46,023 --> 00:14:47,233
Fine.

182
00:14:47,525 --> 00:14:48,901
Let's talk.

183
00:14:49,485 --> 00:14:51,978
But you have to answer my question first.

184
00:14:52,822 --> 00:14:54,885
Did you cheated on me?

185
00:14:57,285 --> 00:14:58,713
Cheat.

186
00:14:59,495 --> 00:15:00,747
What?

187
00:15:01,844 --> 00:15:03,721
If there's a "did"

188
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:05,952
you just use "cheat".

189
00:15:08,504 --> 00:15:12,166
I don't care! Can you answer my question?

190
00:15:14,249 --> 00:15:16,251
If I tell you,

191
00:15:16,304 --> 00:15:18,139
I'm sure you won't believe me.

192
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:20,549
Try me.

193
00:15:23,019 --> 00:15:24,604
I'm your boyfriend.

194
00:15:25,021 --> 00:15:26,564
You know me.

195
00:15:27,565 --> 00:15:30,463
And I don't understand
why you believe in gossip.

196
00:15:34,530 --> 00:15:38,659
Come on... Hannah? Really?

197
00:15:40,411 --> 00:15:42,246
You're prettier than her.

198
00:15:44,081 --> 00:15:45,474
Really?

199
00:15:46,501 --> 00:15:47,771
Of course.

200
00:15:50,544 --> 00:15:51,912
You're my baby.

201
00:15:54,842 --> 00:15:56,326
And cheat on you?

202
00:15:57,969 --> 00:16:02,024
I would never, never cheat on you.

203
00:16:04,594 --> 00:16:06,930
You like this huh?

204
00:16:07,177 --> 00:16:09,304
- You like it?
- Yes.

205
00:16:23,553 --> 00:16:26,764
Were you the one who messaged the podcast?

206
00:16:26,959 --> 00:16:28,252
Huh?

207
00:16:30,603 --> 00:16:31,854
You can tell me anything.

208
00:16:31,902 --> 00:16:33,904
- No, no.
- Are you sure?

209
00:16:34,066 --> 00:16:35,734
I didn't tell them anything.

210
00:16:36,008 --> 00:16:37,844
Okay.

211
00:16:53,837 --> 00:16:56,295
You like that, huh?

212
00:16:56,358 --> 00:16:58,899
Like that?

213
00:17:48,497 --> 00:17:53,502
Why would someone give
me 50,000 pesos for this?

214
00:18:10,853 --> 00:18:13,522
Is this enough to implicate Jiggy?

215
00:18:14,320 --> 00:18:16,906
Then why hasn't he
released a statement yet?

216
00:18:18,262 --> 00:18:19,555
Isn't he panicking?

217
00:18:21,543 --> 00:18:23,294
I need to wait.

218
00:18:27,745 --> 00:18:29,580
- Gab?
- Shit.

219
00:18:33,330 --> 00:18:34,832
Gab!

220
00:18:37,918 --> 00:18:40,295
- Hello?
- Wait a minute!

221
00:18:41,298 --> 00:18:42,674
You're taking too long!

222
00:18:46,661 --> 00:18:48,705
- What happened?
- Hi!

223
00:18:49,209 --> 00:18:51,753
- What's happening?
- I have good news.

224
00:18:52,505 --> 00:18:53,592
What?

225
00:18:53,980 --> 00:18:56,482
Jiggy and I are back together.

226
00:18:56,883 --> 00:18:58,134
You're back with Jiggy?

227
00:18:58,772 --> 00:18:59,773
Yeah, duh.

228
00:19:00,280 --> 00:19:02,950
So what happened to his
possible involvement in a crime?

229
00:19:05,658 --> 00:19:07,159
Well, Gab...

230
00:19:07,467 --> 00:19:09,385
I realized...

231
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,433
why would I believe gossip from a
podcaster over my own boyfriend, right?

232
00:19:14,458 --> 00:19:17,545
Chloe stay away from him!

233
00:19:18,633 --> 00:19:19,676
Hey Gab!

234
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,279
Chloe told me you've been renting here.

235
00:19:27,304 --> 00:19:29,932
So we planned to drop by.

236
00:19:30,679 --> 00:19:34,225
It's been a long time since
I've seen you, so...how are you?

237
00:19:34,503 --> 00:19:36,130
Babe, what do you mean drop by?

238
00:19:36,873 --> 00:19:40,918
We really came here
for you because I thought

239
00:19:40,943 --> 00:19:44,447
you might be sad since
your housemates aren't here.

240
00:19:44,558 --> 00:19:45,768
So...

241
00:19:46,508 --> 00:19:48,259
I can't be the only happy person here.

242
00:19:48,284 --> 00:19:49,380
Let's drink?

243
00:19:51,192 --> 00:19:52,875
I'm coming in.

244
00:19:54,622 --> 00:19:57,877
- Babe!
- You are so nice, thank you.

245
00:19:58,387 --> 00:20:00,347
You're so hospitable.

246
00:20:05,929 --> 00:20:07,624
So I just need to drop that?

247
00:20:08,496 --> 00:20:10,915
Yeah. Have you not tried this before?

248
00:20:12,789 --> 00:20:13,811
No.

249
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:16,255
Okay, so Jiggy goes first. Babe.

250
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:18,115
Show Gab how to do it. Go ahead.

251
00:20:23,068 --> 00:20:25,153
You're so great at that!

252
00:20:25,178 --> 00:20:27,639
I guess your training's paying off, babe.

253
00:20:34,943 --> 00:20:36,152
Is that your room?

254
00:20:36,878 --> 00:20:39,923
Oh! Can I see your room, please?

255
00:20:40,465 --> 00:20:41,549
It's a mess.

256
00:20:41,574 --> 00:20:44,076
Please, Gab? I haven't
been to your room yet.

257
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,638
No, Chloe. It's really messy.

258
00:20:45,662 --> 00:20:48,289
- Come on, I wanna see it!
- Chloe!

259
00:20:48,485 --> 00:20:51,572
- It's a mess.
- I wanna see it though!

260
00:20:51,921 --> 00:20:54,590
Baby, respect her space.

261
00:20:56,181 --> 00:20:59,309
We're friends but you're
such a secretive person.

262
00:20:59,759 --> 00:21:01,594
It's just a room, Chloe.

263
00:21:01,761 --> 00:21:03,263
It's not a secret.

264
00:21:04,545 --> 00:21:06,213
And besides...

265
00:21:06,769 --> 00:21:08,354
everyone has a secret.

266
00:21:08,685 --> 00:21:10,311
Right, Jiggy?

267
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,063
Well, if you ask me...

268
00:21:12,647 --> 00:21:14,399
I have nothing to hide.

269
00:21:14,723 --> 00:21:17,476
Except that big dick.

270
00:21:20,321 --> 00:21:21,573
Is it true?

271
00:21:22,007 --> 00:21:24,843
Is V telling the truth about you?

272
00:21:25,316 --> 00:21:28,528
I know you're protecting Chloe.

273
00:21:29,581 --> 00:21:31,541
But I told her everything.

274
00:21:33,097 --> 00:21:35,141
So we can have a clean slate.

275
00:21:35,920 --> 00:21:38,298
You don't have to talk
shit about me anymore.

276
00:21:40,871 --> 00:21:42,581
And Gab don't worry,

277
00:21:43,636 --> 00:21:45,382
I already forgave you.

278
00:21:49,283 --> 00:21:50,451
Actually Gab,

279
00:21:50,476 --> 00:21:52,604
Jiggy's told me all about it.

280
00:21:52,864 --> 00:21:55,534
Coach sent him a text
last barristers' night.

281
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:57,228
And that's why he left me.

282
00:21:58,028 --> 00:22:01,948
That's what annoyed me. Of all
nights, it had to be barristers' night.

283
00:22:02,533 --> 00:22:04,910
That's the only time we don't train.

284
00:22:05,160 --> 00:22:06,494
But coach,

285
00:22:06,634 --> 00:22:08,678
kept on texting me.

286
00:22:09,100 --> 00:22:11,394
But it's okay because,

287
00:22:11,419 --> 00:22:13,629
coach was just excited to tell him that

288
00:22:13,654 --> 00:22:15,406
they got in the tournament in Korea.

289
00:22:19,881 --> 00:22:20,942
Okay.

290
00:22:22,621 --> 00:22:24,581
Let's just say I believe you.

291
00:22:26,665 --> 00:22:29,751
But what does Your Girl V's source say?

292
00:22:29,776 --> 00:22:32,820
You've been seen lurking
around Hannah's condo.

293
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:35,876
No, Gab. Jiggy's already
told me about that too.

294
00:22:36,721 --> 00:22:40,559
He was just there because one of
his bros got involved with Hannah and

295
00:22:40,584 --> 00:22:42,336
he was just looking out for his teammate.

296
00:22:42,768 --> 00:22:46,855
- He was drunk and has suicidal tendencies.
- Who's this teammate?

297
00:22:47,617 --> 00:22:52,497
I'm not the type of person who
exposes someone's mental condition.

298
00:22:53,522 --> 00:22:56,191
Well I'm sorry but I won't say who it is.

299
00:22:56,634 --> 00:22:59,220
Wasn't that so sweet of him?

300
00:23:00,423 --> 00:23:01,507
Guys,

301
00:23:01,900 --> 00:23:03,443
I'm just so happy that

302
00:23:03,468 --> 00:23:06,220
my best friend and my boyfriend

303
00:23:06,245 --> 00:23:08,456
are talking again. Right?

304
00:23:12,425 --> 00:23:14,177
Let's call it quits.

305
00:23:15,478 --> 00:23:16,562
Gab.

306
00:23:18,373 --> 00:23:20,458
I'm not playing games with you, Chloe.

307
00:23:20,483 --> 00:23:22,491
Stay away from that guy.

308
00:23:23,205 --> 00:23:24,706
He's dangerous!

309
00:23:24,731 --> 00:23:27,567
Can't you be more discerning?
He's making a fool out of you!

310
00:23:27,805 --> 00:23:28,854
Really?

311
00:23:29,131 --> 00:23:30,716
Well, fuck you.

312
00:23:31,553 --> 00:23:33,888
What the fuck is your problem with me?

313
00:23:33,913 --> 00:23:35,498
What did I ever do to you?

314
00:23:37,797 --> 00:23:38,895
You know what?

315
00:23:38,920 --> 00:23:41,214
I knew it.

316
00:23:41,239 --> 00:23:42,573
You and V,

317
00:23:43,128 --> 00:23:44,963
you're conspiring against me.

318
00:23:45,341 --> 00:23:46,843
You're her source, aren't you?

319
00:23:48,386 --> 00:23:49,804
Tell me!

320
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,931
Chloe, come on.

321
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:56,005
Gab, is it you?

322
00:23:58,210 --> 00:23:59,998
I'm just protecting my friend!

323
00:24:00,929 --> 00:24:02,222
Protecting?

324
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:03,943
So it is you.

325
00:24:05,634 --> 00:24:06,968
No!

326
00:24:08,178 --> 00:24:12,506
But that doesn't mean her
source isn't telling the truth.

327
00:24:13,600 --> 00:24:14,726
Chloe!

328
00:24:16,748 --> 00:24:17,874
You know what?

329
00:24:18,176 --> 00:24:19,469
Fuck you!

330
00:24:19,684 --> 00:24:22,020
My girlfriend should be
staying away from you!

331
00:24:22,707 --> 00:24:24,906
You're brainwashing her!

332
00:24:25,673 --> 00:24:26,824
Let's go!

333
00:24:28,358 --> 00:24:31,153
- Fuck this!
- Chloe seriously?

334
00:24:36,157 --> 00:24:37,450
Chloe!

335
00:24:37,631 --> 00:24:39,300
Come on, don't go with him!

336
00:24:39,325 --> 00:24:42,454
Gab! Can you hear yourself?

337
00:24:42,607 --> 00:24:44,484
I can take care of myself!

338
00:24:44,509 --> 00:24:45,635
Shit.

339
00:24:54,619 --> 00:24:56,204
Hey!

340
00:24:59,103 --> 00:25:02,898
Hey! Who are you? What are you doing?

341
00:25:10,843 --> 00:25:12,762
Emerson?

342
00:25:21,437 --> 00:25:22,623
Coach.

343
00:25:36,285 --> 00:25:37,662
Where am I?

344
00:25:40,146 --> 00:25:42,899
If you don't want to be expelled, untie me.

345
00:25:43,920 --> 00:25:46,486
We should be asking you that question.

346
00:25:47,166 --> 00:25:48,716
What are you doing here?

347
00:25:49,481 --> 00:25:52,067
And why did you take my phone?

348
00:25:52,186 --> 00:25:54,647
- Is snatching your new side job?
- Coach,

349
00:25:54,671 --> 00:25:57,298
- tell us the truth.
- Or else we'll call the police.

350
00:26:00,975 --> 00:26:02,186
Go ahead.

351
00:26:02,603 --> 00:26:03,980
Call the police.

352
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:06,649
We'll see who they'll believe.

353
00:26:09,980 --> 00:26:11,190
Is that your phone?

354
00:26:21,038 --> 00:26:22,165
Love?

355
00:26:22,915 --> 00:26:24,327
Who's Love?

356
00:26:24,725 --> 00:26:25,815
Please.

357
00:26:26,252 --> 00:26:27,378
Don't answer it.

358
00:26:28,171 --> 00:26:31,048
- Your wife?
- Coach doesn't have a wife.

359
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:32,550
His girlfriend, maybe?

360
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:35,111
Does your girlfriend know
what you've been doing?

361
00:26:35,136 --> 00:26:36,238
Please.

362
00:26:36,846 --> 00:26:38,306
Don't answer.

363
00:26:39,646 --> 00:26:40,772
Hello, love?

364
00:26:41,085 --> 00:26:43,504
Where are you? Hello?

365
00:26:44,987 --> 00:26:46,309
Can you hear me?

366
00:26:47,102 --> 00:26:49,187
Jiggy?!

367
00:26:55,794 --> 00:26:57,379
Let me call him.

368
00:30:23,407 --> 00:30:25,618
- Are you okay?
- I'm okay.

369
00:30:25,702 --> 00:30:27,829
- Were you hurt?
- I'm okay.

370
00:30:28,117 --> 00:30:29,785
Where's Chloe?

371
00:30:32,450 --> 00:30:33,868
She's home.

372
00:30:34,514 --> 00:30:38,643
- How can I be sure she's-
- Then fucking call her!

373
00:30:39,460 --> 00:30:40,795
I don't give a shit!

374
00:30:41,710 --> 00:30:43,962
What more do you fucking need from us?!

375
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:49,845
Love, didn't I tell you

376
00:30:50,194 --> 00:30:53,067
that I can handle this?

377
00:30:53,199 --> 00:30:55,452
Look at what happened to you.

378
00:30:57,732 --> 00:30:58,941
Bro.

379
00:31:00,288 --> 00:31:02,123
You could have told us.

380
00:31:03,499 --> 00:31:05,641
Why didn't you tell any of us?

381
00:31:06,073 --> 00:31:07,742
Brian knew.

382
00:31:08,217 --> 00:31:10,109
He was the only person I trusted.

383
00:31:10,786 --> 00:31:12,580
Now he's dead!

384
00:31:12,830 --> 00:31:14,290
What about Chloe?

385
00:31:14,989 --> 00:31:16,417
What about her?

386
00:31:16,601 --> 00:31:18,686
You're lying to my friend!

387
00:31:18,711 --> 00:31:19,712
Sure.

388
00:31:20,271 --> 00:31:22,273
Everybody lies, right?

389
00:31:22,349 --> 00:31:24,226
But that doesn't make me a criminal.

390
00:31:24,251 --> 00:31:26,921
- You're fucked up!
- I'm fucked up?

391
00:31:27,444 --> 00:31:28,904
I'm fucked up?!

392
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:32,609
- Tying him down is what's fucked up!
- Enough.

393
00:31:33,813 --> 00:31:35,231
Alright.

394
00:31:37,096 --> 00:31:38,264
Ask us.

395
00:31:39,275 --> 00:31:40,797
Let's end this.

396
00:31:42,105 --> 00:31:43,419
What do you want to know?

397
00:31:43,903 --> 00:31:45,738
Why did you kill Brian?

398
00:31:46,175 --> 00:31:48,390
Are you fucking kidding me?

399
00:31:49,617 --> 00:31:53,287
Why would I kill the only person I trust?

400
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:56,540
And rape Hannah?

401
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:59,168
Are you just that stupid?

402
00:31:59,668 --> 00:32:00,753
Okay.

403
00:32:01,378 --> 00:32:03,464
You didn't have anything to do with Hannah?

404
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,759
Then why did you clean her house?

405
00:32:06,926 --> 00:32:08,886
What evidence are you hiding?

406
00:32:08,990 --> 00:32:10,951
She came to us first.

407
00:32:13,641 --> 00:32:16,268
We don't even know how
she found out about us.

408
00:32:17,311 --> 00:32:18,771
But she did.

409
00:32:49,301 --> 00:32:51,428
Hey you, work on your endurance.

410
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:03,274
Coach and I were shocked
when we saw the video.

411
00:33:04,608 --> 00:33:06,610
Nobody was supposed to know about it.

412
00:33:07,820 --> 00:33:12,867
Coach thought the person who did it
might have had issues with any of us.

413
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:15,661
We had no idea

414
00:33:16,094 --> 00:33:18,347
where room 808 was or

415
00:33:18,372 --> 00:33:19,957
who H was.

416
00:33:32,612 --> 00:33:34,113
Is this what you want?

417
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:36,682
She wanted to have sex with us.

418
00:33:39,160 --> 00:33:40,703
Not just sex.

419
00:33:40,728 --> 00:33:42,938
She wanted us to role play.

420
00:33:43,402 --> 00:33:46,143
And pretend to violate her.

421
00:34:18,541 --> 00:34:21,747
It started out normal
but Hannah got weirder.

422
00:34:22,575 --> 00:34:24,743
I don't know what happened.

423
00:34:25,564 --> 00:34:27,483
But she said it was one of her kinks.

424
00:35:03,416 --> 00:35:05,644
We thought she would stop.

425
00:35:05,669 --> 00:35:08,615
That she won't blackmail us anymore
if we do what she wants.

426
00:35:10,558 --> 00:35:12,059
But she didn't.

427
00:35:13,205 --> 00:35:15,270
She wanted to expose us.

428
00:35:17,625 --> 00:35:19,752
Of course if that happens,

429
00:35:20,692 --> 00:35:22,315
Coach will lose his job.

430
00:35:23,679 --> 00:35:24,794
And I

431
00:35:26,083 --> 00:35:28,502
will be disowned by my whole family.

432
00:35:33,257 --> 00:35:35,092
We didn't know that

433
00:35:35,592 --> 00:35:37,636
she'd use our recording

434
00:35:38,053 --> 00:35:39,888
to blackmail us even more.

435
00:35:41,301 --> 00:35:43,845
Why? What's in the video?

436
00:35:44,553 --> 00:35:47,014
She just told us to wait for her message.

437
00:35:47,669 --> 00:35:50,046
Or was it a call? I don't know anymore.

438
00:35:52,168 --> 00:35:54,956
Then it came after a week.

439
00:35:55,648 --> 00:35:57,995
Then after a week came barristers' night.

440
00:35:59,175 --> 00:36:01,093
The incident happened.

441
00:36:01,118 --> 00:36:02,453
Now she's in a coma.

442
00:36:03,247 --> 00:36:06,916
I don't wanna say I'm happy about it but...

443
00:36:07,666 --> 00:36:09,376
I am.

444
00:36:11,081 --> 00:36:12,307
Do you think...

445
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:16,216
she had a reason to do that to you?

446
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,546
We've thought about it so many times.

447
00:36:22,328 --> 00:36:24,564
And we have a number of ideas.

448
00:36:27,561 --> 00:36:29,646
Didn't you say it was about money?

449
00:36:30,981 --> 00:36:32,149
Yeah.

450
00:36:32,983 --> 00:36:34,318
And Marion.

451
00:36:35,986 --> 00:36:37,780
Money for Marion?

452
00:36:37,821 --> 00:36:39,490
How can you say that?

453
00:36:40,157 --> 00:36:42,242
I saw him in Hannah's condo.

454
00:36:42,993 --> 00:36:44,787
You saw him?

455
00:36:51,409 --> 00:36:52,994
No, I mean...

456
00:36:54,246 --> 00:36:55,706
I saw his,

457
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:59,343
- the spoon he uses for-
- I get it.

458
00:37:03,138 --> 00:37:04,848
Do you know about this?

459
00:37:06,172 --> 00:37:07,927
You know about their possible relationship?

460
00:37:07,927 --> 00:37:09,162
It's about Marion's debt.

461
00:37:09,186 --> 00:37:10,562
Yup.

462
00:37:11,066 --> 00:37:12,609
Money.

463
00:37:26,370 --> 00:37:27,830
Good shit?

464
00:38:06,858 --> 00:38:08,985
That's motive number 1.

465
00:38:26,638 --> 00:38:27,681
That's it.

466
00:38:29,666 --> 00:38:33,628
It means Marion's been
going to Hannah's secret condo.

467
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:37,900
All along, he was Hannah's secret lover.

468
00:38:39,479 --> 00:38:40,814
Jealousy.

469
00:38:41,093 --> 00:38:42,178
Right?

470
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,323
That's motive number 2.

471
00:38:47,612 --> 00:38:51,325
Agent Abueva should know all of these.

472
00:38:51,496 --> 00:38:53,790
And get Brian's case opened again.

473
00:38:55,011 --> 00:38:58,348
And focus on Marion this time.

474
00:39:00,545 --> 00:39:02,380
Hold on, Gab.

475
00:39:03,121 --> 00:39:05,457
If you go straight to the police,

476
00:39:05,802 --> 00:39:09,514
they're going to need
solid evidence from you.

477
00:39:10,873 --> 00:39:12,624
I knew it.

478
00:39:15,814 --> 00:39:18,734
Are you really here to help Brian?

479
00:39:18,820 --> 00:39:20,905
Or cover up Marion's crimes?

480
00:39:21,931 --> 00:39:24,046
They're both important to me, Gab.

481
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,015
What do you mean?

482
00:39:28,060 --> 00:39:29,330
Trust me.

483
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,852
The same way Brian
trusted me to keep you safe.

484
00:39:39,670 --> 00:39:40,963
Hello, bro.

485
00:39:42,681 --> 00:39:44,933
Hello? Where did you go?

486
00:39:46,694 --> 00:39:48,654
The party just started.

487
00:39:48,679 --> 00:39:51,473
I just need to take care
of something real quick.

488
00:39:51,933 --> 00:39:53,352
Bro?

489
00:39:53,377 --> 00:39:54,629
I have a favor to ask.

490
00:39:55,385 --> 00:39:58,430
If you see Gab San Andres,

491
00:39:58,939 --> 00:40:00,232
can you...

492
00:40:01,942 --> 00:40:04,611
can you keep an eye on her for me?

493
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,574
Please tell her I'll be quick,
and I'll come back right away.

494
00:40:09,783 --> 00:40:11,118
Gab?

495
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:13,209
Flopcast?

496
00:40:13,662 --> 00:40:14,997
You're together?

497
00:40:15,571 --> 00:40:20,410
You're such a jerk. Don't let her
hear you say that or she'll punch you.

498
00:40:20,435 --> 00:40:23,438
But I thought you and Hannah were together?

499
00:40:23,563 --> 00:40:25,023
Now it's Gab?

500
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:26,675
How did that happen, bro?

501
00:40:27,698 --> 00:40:29,499
It's complicated.

502
00:40:30,637 --> 00:40:34,391
I admit it was sudden but

503
00:40:35,642 --> 00:40:37,060
I'm happy, man.

504
00:40:37,644 --> 00:40:39,563
We're happy.

505
00:40:44,487 --> 00:40:49,159
Emerson, I'll tell you about
it when I'm done with this.

506
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,241
Until then,

507
00:40:52,327 --> 00:40:54,584
can I trust you with Gab?

508
00:41:01,335 --> 00:41:03,462
I've known him for a long time.

509
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,884
That was the first time I
heard him talk like that.

510
00:41:10,993 --> 00:41:12,852
He may not have told me,

511
00:41:15,640 --> 00:41:17,642
but I knew he loved you.

512
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:24,441
That's why I did the favor he asked.

513
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,202
Okay.

514
00:41:38,174 --> 00:41:40,509
Let's say I agree to this.

515
00:41:42,042 --> 00:41:43,668
What do you plan to do?

516
00:41:46,683 --> 00:41:48,491
Give me a few days.

517
00:41:49,953 --> 00:41:51,907
Let me deal with Marion.

518
00:41:54,389 --> 00:41:55,974
He is my friend.

519
00:41:56,014 --> 00:41:59,585
I can get the truth out of
him better than you can.

520
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:09,662
If you only listened to me,

521
00:42:11,977 --> 00:42:13,690
if you just trusted me,

522
00:42:16,119 --> 00:42:18,448
this wouldn't have
happened to you and Brian.

523
00:42:21,373 --> 00:42:22,874
I'm sorry, Hannah.

524
00:42:31,601 --> 00:42:33,686
I analyzed the bet.

525
00:42:34,345 --> 00:42:37,307
- It's a sure win!
- Fuck this, man!

526
00:42:39,003 --> 00:42:40,629
Fuck you, Bri.

527
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:43,987
Who do you think you are, asshole?

528
00:42:45,518 --> 00:42:47,716
I'll fucking kill you.

529
00:42:50,357 --> 00:42:54,278
I can go to the school
and spill your secrets.

530
00:42:57,907 --> 00:42:59,492
Ladies,

531
00:42:59,725 --> 00:43:01,310
and gentlemen.

532
00:43:01,899 --> 00:43:03,818
I welcome you to...

533
00:43:04,280 --> 00:43:07,717
First class!
