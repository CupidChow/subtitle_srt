1
00:00:12,679 --> 00:00:14,023
Jiggy sent a message.

2
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:15,974
What did he say?

3
00:00:18,226 --> 00:00:19,878
Hannah is a fucking snake.

4
00:00:31,656 --> 00:00:33,074
What the fuck?

5
00:00:33,867 --> 00:00:36,119
That's our old principal!

6
00:00:39,008 --> 00:00:42,016
Shit. Even San Lucas'
old chief of police is here.

7
00:00:49,030 --> 00:00:51,577
And it hurts that

8
00:00:53,178 --> 00:00:55,080
she suffered the same fate as her sister

9
00:00:55,555 --> 00:00:58,500
who was just as unlucky

10
00:00:58,808 --> 00:01:00,210
at Potenciana.

11
00:01:01,144 --> 00:01:02,145
That's too bad.

12
00:01:03,980 --> 00:01:05,090
Sister?

13
00:01:05,482 --> 00:01:08,093
Hannah has a sister?

14
00:01:09,152 --> 00:01:11,054
What do you mean

15
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:12,890
she was unlucky?

16
00:01:14,866 --> 00:01:17,060
She was raped at Potenciana.

17
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:21,671
Imagine.

18
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,360
You and me together,

19
00:01:26,377 --> 00:01:28,505
for hours in bed.

20
00:01:28,713 --> 00:01:34,219
We look out the window, and
the Eiffel Tower's right there.

21
00:01:50,781 --> 00:01:51,820
Dude!

22
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:53,822
I don't wanna be a part of this!

23
00:01:56,116 --> 00:01:57,492
Ramon!

24
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:00,411
Those monsters Zuniga and Valles,

25
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:02,413
and their henchmen,

26
00:02:03,998 --> 00:02:04,999
it's them.

27
00:02:06,209 --> 00:02:07,903
They're the ones who need to pay.

28
00:02:09,921 --> 00:02:11,840
You wouldn't have known

29
00:02:12,056 --> 00:02:15,476
if Zuniga and Valles have
already filled their pockets.

30
00:02:15,541 --> 00:02:18,586
Even that reporter Hizon.

31
00:02:19,299 --> 00:02:24,054
I don't know why we wasted time
asking for help from him.

32
00:02:24,743 --> 00:02:27,370
You said you were going to help me.

33
00:02:28,212 --> 00:02:29,550
Joey.

34
00:02:33,027 --> 00:02:37,891
All we have are circumstantial evidence.

35
00:02:39,075 --> 00:02:41,728
We need a direct evidence.

36
00:02:42,829 --> 00:02:44,064
Ms. Arceo,

37
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:47,054
I really didn't want to get involved,

38
00:02:47,427 --> 00:02:49,528
but you heard the chief.

39
00:02:50,329 --> 00:02:52,164
Let them do their job.

40
00:02:52,429 --> 00:02:54,473
They know what they're doing.

41
00:04:16,435 --> 00:04:18,325
You're late for Brian's service.

42
00:04:20,731 --> 00:04:23,442
I thought you weren't gonna show up.

43
00:04:24,659 --> 00:04:26,494
But thank you, Gab.

44
00:04:26,614 --> 00:04:28,658
Thanks for everything.

45
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,758
I only did that to uncover
the truth, Hannah.

46
00:04:36,442 --> 00:04:38,278
It's the right thing to do, isn't it?

47
00:04:39,195 --> 00:04:42,031
So I really hope you're telling the truth.

48
00:04:42,818 --> 00:04:44,528
What do you mean?

49
00:04:44,726 --> 00:04:46,895
I hope you're also doing the right thing

50
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:49,898
and that you're not lying.

51
00:04:53,002 --> 00:04:55,779
I know about unit 808, Hannah.

52
00:04:56,963 --> 00:04:59,282
And I've seen all of your videos.

53
00:05:01,688 --> 00:05:03,703
I'm not gonna deny that, Gab.

54
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,208
But if you want to know more,

55
00:05:09,558 --> 00:05:11,461
invite me to your live stream.

56
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:14,147
I'll tell you everything.

57
00:07:31,284 --> 00:07:33,536
Why do you hate me?

58
00:07:35,678 --> 00:07:37,346
Hate?

59
00:07:37,678 --> 00:07:39,596
I don't hate you.

60
00:07:41,539 --> 00:07:44,166
Hate is a strong word, Gab.

61
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:46,945
Come on, Hannah.

62
00:07:47,216 --> 00:07:48,843
It's fine.

63
00:07:49,343 --> 00:07:53,556
I've always known you hated me
even before the incident happened.

64
00:07:54,724 --> 00:07:57,518
Why did you take that
video of me and Emerson?

65
00:07:57,977 --> 00:07:59,937
We weren't even close then.

66
00:08:01,105 --> 00:08:04,384
Gab, that's old news.

67
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:09,238
Yeah right. Old news?

68
00:08:09,572 --> 00:08:12,408
I haven't forgotten about
Ms. Arceo taking your side.

69
00:08:14,076 --> 00:08:17,205
I wish I was that close to
the guidance counselor.

70
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,249
She was doing her job.

71
00:08:20,374 --> 00:08:22,460
That's it.

72
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:27,157
To be honest,

73
00:08:28,716 --> 00:08:30,452
I took that video,

74
00:08:31,059 --> 00:08:32,544
so you'll stay away.

75
00:08:36,682 --> 00:08:39,336
Brian's world is dangerous, Gab.

76
00:08:40,886 --> 00:08:42,968
If you stick your fingers
in places you shouldn't

77
00:08:43,856 --> 00:08:45,342
they'll suck you in even deeper.

78
00:08:47,818 --> 00:08:49,638
No emergency exit.

79
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:53,642
What do you mean?

80
00:08:58,746 --> 00:09:00,940
That world is dangerous, Gab.

81
00:09:02,333 --> 00:09:05,070
I've been a victim of that world.

82
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,364
As a woman,

83
00:09:08,631 --> 00:09:10,867
I wanted to protect you from them.

84
00:09:15,638 --> 00:09:18,792
I don't want the same world
to make a victim out of you.

85
00:09:21,978 --> 00:09:23,588
We're the same, Gab.

86
00:09:24,313 --> 00:09:26,675
No, we're not.

87
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:30,387
I don't take videos of my conquests.

88
00:09:31,737 --> 00:09:33,056
Conquests?

89
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,644
You think that?

90
00:09:40,246 --> 00:09:41,731
What are they then?

91
00:09:43,749 --> 00:09:45,276
I know you know.

92
00:09:46,627 --> 00:09:48,321
You're not stupid, Gab.

93
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:51,282
Go ahead. Say it.

94
00:09:54,969 --> 00:09:59,082
Why did you take those
videos, Hannah Andal?

95
00:10:06,853 --> 00:10:10,927
I wanted to avenge my
sister for what they did to her.

96
00:10:21,138 --> 00:10:22,564
Tina...

97
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,941
I'm on the honor roll, just like you were.

98
00:10:26,346 --> 00:10:28,695
I told you I'd make it, didn't I?

99
00:10:29,712 --> 00:10:33,992
As promised, I'm determined
to follow your footsteps.

100
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:37,328
I was accepted at Potenciana too.

101
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:39,622
On scholarship, just like you were.

102
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:43,626
You were right, sis.

103
00:10:43,976 --> 00:10:46,087
Potenciana's huge.

104
00:10:46,937 --> 00:10:48,923
I'm happy to have visited it, finally.

105
00:10:49,914 --> 00:10:53,970
So when school starts, I won't get lost.

106
00:10:54,779 --> 00:10:57,599
I found each one of them too.

107
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:01,561
I'll bring them to justice
one by one for you.

108
00:11:02,953 --> 00:11:04,725
Watch me, okay?

109
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,585
I hope you enjoy it.

110
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:09,528
And I hope it makes you happy.

111
00:11:09,877 --> 00:11:11,821
Because I'm going to punish them.

112
00:11:21,044 --> 00:11:22,379
Let's go.

113
00:11:22,712 --> 00:11:23,963
Dickhead.

114
00:11:28,062 --> 00:11:31,678
Hannah, don't be scared.

115
00:11:33,317 --> 00:11:35,678
That man was guilty.

116
00:11:36,112 --> 00:11:37,514
He deserved that.

117
00:11:43,077 --> 00:11:46,388
What happened to Christina was his fault.

118
00:11:49,125 --> 00:11:50,756
I hate that guy.

119
00:11:52,712 --> 00:11:55,263
Serves him right.

120
00:12:30,504 --> 00:12:31,735
Look at this.

121
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:35,118
Don't worry.

122
00:12:40,885 --> 00:12:46,907
Chief of Police Singson's body
has been found after 48 hours.

123
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,485
The body was found in a river in San Lucas.

124
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:54,231
Singson's involvement in human trafficking
and corruption has also been discovered

125
00:12:54,256 --> 00:12:59,344
leading to assumptions that this
might have something to do with his death.

126
00:12:59,594 --> 00:13:02,095
Prior to finding the body,

127
00:13:02,095 --> 00:13:05,789
the police received some
anonymous tips regarding the matter.

128
00:13:07,119 --> 00:13:12,618
Nobody said anything about you or me.
You're fine.

129
00:13:15,294 --> 00:13:20,660
I know you found out about her
when you went to Tanglaw.

130
00:13:21,475 --> 00:13:24,370
Yeah, she killed herself.

131
00:13:25,066 --> 00:13:26,164
No!

132
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:29,863
They killed her from the inside.

133
00:13:31,753 --> 00:13:34,756
She had no choice but to kill herself.

134
00:13:37,386 --> 00:13:39,761
So everyone who did that to her,

135
00:13:40,555 --> 00:13:43,348
everyone who didn't help her,

136
00:13:44,125 --> 00:13:45,626
I'll make them pay.

137
00:15:19,164 --> 00:15:20,749
Hit me!

138
00:15:21,448 --> 00:15:22,491
Harder!

139
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:26,536
More!

140
00:15:27,582 --> 00:15:28,914
Yeah!

141
00:15:41,234 --> 00:15:42,819
Hit me!

142
00:15:42,844 --> 00:15:45,096
Like that! More!

143
00:15:50,519 --> 00:15:52,646
I want more!

144
00:16:10,664 --> 00:16:13,375
What exactly did you do, Hannah?

145
00:16:15,418 --> 00:16:16,851
I recorded them.

146
00:16:18,338 --> 00:16:22,773
I record them in their
most vulnerable state.

147
00:16:24,177 --> 00:16:26,711
I use those recordings to blackmail them,

148
00:16:28,306 --> 00:16:29,975
to harass them.

149
00:16:30,494 --> 00:16:31,922
To kill them?

150
00:16:35,063 --> 00:16:37,101
Did you kill them, Hannah Andal?

151
00:16:38,024 --> 00:16:40,625
Because all of these people are dead.

152
00:16:41,820 --> 00:16:44,320
Are you calling me a killer?

153
00:16:46,708 --> 00:16:50,625
- Oh my god, Gab!
- It's a yes or no question, Hannah Andal.

154
00:16:52,497 --> 00:16:53,898
No.

155
00:16:55,667 --> 00:16:58,795
Maybe God's finally being fair

156
00:16:59,754 --> 00:17:01,673
and the heavens are ready to judge them.

157
00:17:01,994 --> 00:17:03,496
Or perhaps it's karma?

158
00:17:03,521 --> 00:17:05,857
Whatever you like to believe in.

159
00:17:06,281 --> 00:17:07,741
I believe in the truth.

160
00:17:07,766 --> 00:17:09,643
Well this is the truth.

161
00:17:09,817 --> 00:17:12,194
I cannot kill anyone.

162
00:17:13,994 --> 00:17:15,203
How about Brian?

163
00:17:15,562 --> 00:17:18,440
- What about him?
- Brian is dead.

164
00:17:19,482 --> 00:17:21,651
Is that just a coincidence?

165
00:17:22,027 --> 00:17:25,133
Fuck you! I loved Brian.

166
00:17:25,986 --> 00:17:30,930
- He was the only one who cared for me.
- Then why did you call him a trap earlier?

167
00:17:32,545 --> 00:17:34,964
He's running a gambling operation.

168
00:17:35,269 --> 00:17:36,854
He does drugs.

169
00:17:37,292 --> 00:17:38,710
He fucks around.

170
00:17:38,735 --> 00:17:40,805
And I know you've heard about it.

171
00:17:42,923 --> 00:17:45,891
I sacrificed and compromised a lot.

172
00:17:46,927 --> 00:17:49,971
I've sacrificed myself and my values

173
00:17:49,996 --> 00:17:51,695
just to be with him.

174
00:17:52,232 --> 00:17:54,312
Just so I could belong in his world.

175
00:17:56,662 --> 00:17:58,827
You've seen his world haven't you, Gab?

176
00:17:59,648 --> 00:18:01,608
How about you?

177
00:18:02,317 --> 00:18:05,117
What have you given up to be with him?

178
00:18:06,367 --> 00:18:08,619
What have you sacrificed for Brian?

179
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:13,828
This is not about me.

180
00:18:16,075 --> 00:18:18,406
Then who is this all about?

181
00:18:25,507 --> 00:18:28,226
This interview is about you, Hannah Andal.

182
00:18:29,844 --> 00:18:35,039
The night before Brian Zuniga died,
he texted me,

183
00:18:35,579 --> 00:18:39,531
that he found out something about you,
that's why he had to meet you.

184
00:18:41,606 --> 00:18:44,067
What did he find out?

185
00:18:44,523 --> 00:18:47,946
Is it the reason why he's dead?

186
00:18:53,785 --> 00:18:56,523
He knew about the videos.

187
00:18:59,666 --> 00:19:01,523
He was disgusted.

188
00:19:03,778 --> 00:19:05,726
And he broke up with me.

189
00:19:08,516 --> 00:19:12,234
I know you were the reason why
he didn't take me back.

190
00:19:14,472 --> 00:19:17,531
I'm guessing that's why
you visited me in the hospital.

191
00:19:18,768 --> 00:19:22,828
Because deep inside,
you feel guilty for me.

192
00:19:25,025 --> 00:19:26,703
I was just confused.

193
00:19:27,652 --> 00:19:30,989
Desperate to get answers to my questions.

194
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:34,000
Confused?

195
00:19:35,512 --> 00:19:37,973
How do you think I feel?

196
00:19:42,762 --> 00:19:45,320
I'm the one who needs answers Gab.

197
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,089
What are you supposed to be?

198
00:19:48,844 --> 00:19:51,914
Are you a friend or an enemy?

199
00:19:57,098 --> 00:19:59,059
Honestly,

200
00:20:00,685 --> 00:20:02,711
I really don't know.

201
00:20:04,939 --> 00:20:06,320
Fine.

202
00:20:08,568 --> 00:20:10,492
If you're not my friend,

203
00:20:11,529 --> 00:20:13,364
then you're my ally.

204
00:20:13,761 --> 00:20:15,914
That's how I'll see you from now on.

205
00:20:31,674 --> 00:20:34,453
Thanks for the time, Hannah.

206
00:20:35,136 --> 00:20:37,305
And believe it or not,

207
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:40,734
however you feel about me,

208
00:20:41,442 --> 00:20:43,406
I'm so sorry for what happened to you.

209
00:20:47,002 --> 00:20:48,999
What's done is done.

210
00:20:49,692 --> 00:20:51,945
I don't want to hold grudges anymore.

211
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:53,530
Especially towards you.

212
00:20:54,989 --> 00:21:00,036
It's just too bad we loved the same man.

213
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:04,313
Do you miss Brian?

214
00:21:09,916 --> 00:21:14,186
I guess we both have to
move on from him and all of this.

215
00:21:17,891 --> 00:21:20,115
So what are your plans?

216
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:22,809
Now that you're out of Potenciana.

217
00:21:25,061 --> 00:21:27,438
Technically, I'm not cleared yet but

218
00:21:27,438 --> 00:21:30,900
I've already applied to other schools
and I get to keep my scholarship.

219
00:21:31,317 --> 00:21:33,875
How about you? Will you
be staying in Potenciana?

220
00:21:35,446 --> 00:21:37,532
Nothing's changed, really.

221
00:21:37,557 --> 00:21:40,894
It took sometime but after all this,

222
00:21:41,244 --> 00:21:44,747
I'm going to make true
of my sister's dream.

223
00:21:44,973 --> 00:21:47,142
I'll go to France

224
00:21:47,167 --> 00:21:49,127
to continue my studies.

225
00:21:49,127 --> 00:21:50,859
And live there for good.

226
00:21:51,588 --> 00:21:53,453
There, I'll be free.

227
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:56,484
Good luck.

228
00:22:10,106 --> 00:22:11,758
What was that for?

229
00:22:12,630 --> 00:22:15,140
You miss Brian, right?

230
00:22:16,021 --> 00:22:18,523
I was the last girl he kissed.

231
00:22:19,032 --> 00:22:22,368
Think of it as his goodbye kiss to you.

232
00:22:24,454 --> 00:22:25,906
Bye, Gab.

233
00:22:44,846 --> 00:22:48,453
Now the world knows about us, Brian Zuniga.

234
00:22:50,928 --> 00:22:53,367
You gave me a lot of problems,

235
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:56,736
and a lot of headaches too.

236
00:22:57,737 --> 00:22:59,489
But oh well,

237
00:23:00,471 --> 00:23:01,679
it is what it is.

238
00:23:03,368 --> 00:23:04,461
I love you.

239
00:23:07,622 --> 00:23:11,719
I'm okay now at least.

240
00:23:15,546 --> 00:23:18,351
Because I know you didn't have
anything to do with the incident and...

241
00:23:21,511 --> 00:23:23,351
you really did love me.

242
00:23:29,811 --> 00:23:33,648
Thank you for being a part of my life.

243
00:23:35,984 --> 00:23:39,086
I discovered a lot of things
about myself because of you.

244
00:23:43,157 --> 00:23:44,492
Bye.

245
00:23:56,671 --> 00:23:59,922
Sorry. You're housemate let me in.

246
00:24:05,138 --> 00:24:07,266
Why did you take a video of me and Emerson?

247
00:24:07,719 --> 00:24:09,701
We weren't even close then.

248
00:24:09,726 --> 00:24:11,226
That's old news.

249
00:24:11,648 --> 00:24:14,247
Yeah right. Old news?

250
00:24:14,272 --> 00:24:16,691
I haven't forgotten about
Ms. Arceo taking your side.

251
00:24:16,849 --> 00:24:19,769
I wish I was that close to
the guidance counselor.

252
00:24:20,762 --> 00:24:22,656
She was just doing her job.

253
00:24:24,782 --> 00:24:27,285
She just mentioned your name
and you're already pissed.

254
00:24:28,578 --> 00:24:30,913
It's not that.

255
00:24:30,938 --> 00:24:34,983
I was just thinking about what you said.
Ms. Arceo does seem close to Hannah.

256
00:24:35,008 --> 00:24:36,836
Too close, you know?

257
00:24:39,886 --> 00:24:41,641
Chloe actually mentioned that

258
00:24:42,633 --> 00:24:47,273
Ms. Arceo visited Hannah
every single day she was in a coma.

259
00:24:49,390 --> 00:24:53,728
I think she'd do the same for any student.

260
00:24:53,753 --> 00:24:55,000
No way.

261
00:24:55,516 --> 00:25:00,547
She didn't do that for our
teammate when he was hospitalized.

262
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:03,488
The guy was there for 13 days,

263
00:25:03,723 --> 00:25:07,977
and he didn't hear anything from Ms. Arceo.
Not a single get well soon gift.

264
00:25:08,242 --> 00:25:12,330
Maybe Hannah's case was different?
Your teammate wasn't dying was he?

265
00:25:13,414 --> 00:25:14,687
I guess...

266
00:25:15,583 --> 00:25:19,305
Anyway, what are your plans?

267
00:25:20,004 --> 00:25:21,797
It's your last day in Potenciana.

268
00:25:22,799 --> 00:25:24,391
Do you need anything?

269
00:25:26,636 --> 00:25:30,922
It's just the clearance. I can handle it.
You don't have to look out for me anymore.

270
00:25:33,559 --> 00:25:35,867
What if I want to?

271
00:25:37,199 --> 00:25:38,602
Is that okay?

272
00:25:42,568 --> 00:25:44,117
Coffee's ready.

273
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,427
I'm glad you found a new school for you.

274
00:25:56,040 --> 00:25:58,126
That's why I wanted to see you,

275
00:25:58,151 --> 00:26:00,737
because I might not be
able to see you again.

276
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:05,164
I also wanted to thank you.

277
00:26:06,050 --> 00:26:07,802
Thank me for what?

278
00:26:07,878 --> 00:26:09,463
For helping Hannah,

279
00:26:09,586 --> 00:26:13,548
and the Potenciana community,
by uncovering the truth.

280
00:26:15,026 --> 00:26:18,654
That's the reason I took up Journalism.

281
00:26:21,274 --> 00:26:23,276
What? What happened?

282
00:26:25,445 --> 00:26:27,447
Your bracelet's cute.

283
00:26:29,449 --> 00:26:32,577
My best friend gave this to me years ago.

284
00:26:32,657 --> 00:26:34,201
Like what they say,

285
00:26:34,370 --> 00:26:36,247
Paris is the city of love,

286
00:26:36,372 --> 00:26:38,541
where you can love freely.

287
00:26:38,702 --> 00:26:41,789
It's always been a
dream of mine to go there.

288
00:26:44,125 --> 00:26:47,295
Hannah says it's where she's headed too.

289
00:26:49,445 --> 00:26:52,646
Well, Paris has its allure to everyone.

290
00:26:55,154 --> 00:26:57,573
Who knows? You might end up there too.

291
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:03,928
But for now, I'd like to wish you good
luck, and may you live the life you want.

292
00:27:06,319 --> 00:27:08,311
I wish that for you too, Ms. Arceo.

293
00:27:34,305 --> 00:27:39,725
Hey, Gab. Are you okay?
You look like you're in deep thought.

294
00:27:41,729 --> 00:27:44,272
I was thinking about
what you said yesterday.

295
00:27:45,942 --> 00:27:51,038
Why are Hannah and Ms. Arceo so close?

296
00:28:08,172 --> 00:28:10,049
I said that?

297
00:28:12,187 --> 00:28:13,491
Come on.

298
00:28:14,821 --> 00:28:17,717
Oh. I forgot about that.

299
00:28:18,224 --> 00:28:20,639
Okay, what about it?

300
00:28:21,686 --> 00:28:23,420
I find it suspicious.

301
00:28:24,730 --> 00:28:29,436
I don't know if this a reach,
or if it makes sense even, but...

302
00:28:30,903 --> 00:28:32,210
what if...

303
00:28:33,447 --> 00:28:38,131
Ms. Arceo and Hannah's
sister knew each other?

304
00:28:47,564 --> 00:28:48,639
Wait.

305
00:28:50,631 --> 00:28:55,772
How are we going to find Christina in
the yearbooks if she didn't graduate?

306
00:28:57,953 --> 00:29:01,357
Not her. We're looking for Ms. Arceo.

307
00:29:01,934 --> 00:29:05,062
We need to know if they met or

308
00:29:05,087 --> 00:29:09,467
if she was a teacher then,
or if they were batch mates.

309
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:11,208
Okay, got it.

310
00:29:15,656 --> 00:29:18,553
- Gab, look.
- What?

311
00:29:19,994 --> 00:29:22,678
Coach Saenz as a student

312
00:29:23,289 --> 00:29:24,850
just looks weird.

313
00:29:28,781 --> 00:29:29,873
See?

314
00:29:35,114 --> 00:29:36,498
Brian's older brother?

315
00:29:38,137 --> 00:29:40,522
- They were batch mates.
- Yup.

316
00:29:41,432 --> 00:29:44,741
Also Sonny, Marion's older brother.

317
00:29:47,813 --> 00:29:50,366
Don't get distracted,
they're not who we're looking for.

318
00:30:04,045 --> 00:30:06,631
Ms. Arceo, right?

319
00:30:07,166 --> 00:30:10,428
She was a teacher by the time
Ramon and his friends graduated.

320
00:30:13,673 --> 00:30:15,466
Student teacher, you mean.

321
00:30:15,653 --> 00:30:18,530
She was an assistant
adviser to Potenciana Cares.

322
00:30:22,306 --> 00:30:23,842
Christina?

323
00:30:25,810 --> 00:30:28,155
Emerson, isn't this Christina?

324
00:30:28,322 --> 00:30:29,657
Right there.

325
00:30:38,989 --> 00:30:41,905
Coach. Thank you for meeting me.

326
00:30:43,494 --> 00:30:45,022
What do you need from me?

327
00:30:46,038 --> 00:30:48,663
Jiggy told me not to talk to you.

328
00:30:48,999 --> 00:30:50,960
But you sounded desperate.

329
00:30:52,962 --> 00:30:54,991
We just have a few questions about Hannah.

330
00:30:57,258 --> 00:30:58,428
Again?

331
00:31:00,678 --> 00:31:02,647
Aren't you fucking done with this?

332
00:31:03,222 --> 00:31:05,108
- I don't want anything to do with this.
- No.

333
00:31:05,641 --> 00:31:07,131
This is about her sister.

334
00:31:09,854 --> 00:31:11,053
Christina.

335
00:31:18,779 --> 00:31:20,114
Come in.

336
00:31:22,158 --> 00:31:23,249
Sit.

337
00:31:25,453 --> 00:31:27,204
All good, ma'am.

338
00:31:40,634 --> 00:31:42,139
Hannah's sister,

339
00:31:42,606 --> 00:31:44,249
Christina.

340
00:31:45,931 --> 00:31:47,944
I don't know anyone named Christina.

341
00:31:50,394 --> 00:31:52,803
You attended Potenciana at the same time.

342
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:58,178
Beautiful, tan, long-haired.

343
00:31:58,944 --> 00:32:00,772
I said I don't know her.

344
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:08,405
She was on scholarship
but she didn't graduate.

345
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:10,998
Christina?

346
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:15,967
She killed herself.

347
00:32:17,869 --> 00:32:20,162
Hannah said that she was raped.

348
00:32:21,822 --> 00:32:24,326
But the culprits were never caught.

349
00:32:34,021 --> 00:32:36,053
I don't know what you're talking about.

350
00:32:37,795 --> 00:32:39,264
Hannah also said

351
00:32:40,110 --> 00:32:43,788
she'd avenge her sister and
take down everyone involved.

352
00:32:44,891 --> 00:32:46,351
Coach.

353
00:32:46,719 --> 00:32:50,306
Is this why she's been targeting you?
Because you know something?

354
00:32:53,183 --> 00:32:54,810
I don't know anything.

355
00:32:54,948 --> 00:32:56,983
I have no idea what you're talking about.

356
00:32:58,509 --> 00:33:00,553
Then why is she targeting you, coach?

357
00:33:02,912 --> 00:33:04,580
What do you want to know?

358
00:33:05,398 --> 00:33:07,066
What are you trying to prove?

359
00:33:07,258 --> 00:33:09,843
I've already said
I don't know anything about it!

360
00:33:10,352 --> 00:33:12,999
If you don't know anything about it
then why is she targeting you?

361
00:33:13,834 --> 00:33:15,169
I don't know, okay?

362
00:33:15,211 --> 00:33:17,172
I didn't do anything to her!

363
00:33:17,725 --> 00:33:20,122
You didn't do anything to her?
So you were there?

364
00:33:20,818 --> 00:33:21,819
Fuck.

365
00:33:21,844 --> 00:33:24,641
Why is she doing this?
What did you do, coach?

366
00:33:25,364 --> 00:33:26,699
I don't know.

367
00:33:26,866 --> 00:33:27,992
I don't know!

368
00:33:27,992 --> 00:33:30,850
- Then why is she doing this to you?!
- I was just there!

369
00:33:45,553 --> 00:33:47,305
Fuck you, Ramon!

370
00:33:50,131 --> 00:33:53,194
I was there but I didn't
do anything to her!

371
00:33:54,483 --> 00:33:57,928
I didn't do anything, I
didn't even touch her!

372
00:34:02,075 --> 00:34:03,994
They just dragged me into it.

373
00:34:04,312 --> 00:34:06,355
They got me involved.

374
00:34:06,380 --> 00:34:08,715
I didn't do anything.

375
00:34:10,124 --> 00:34:11,793
They did it.

376
00:34:13,412 --> 00:34:17,791
I just watched. They dragged me into it
but I had nothing to do with what they did!

377
00:34:18,373 --> 00:34:20,041
It wasn't me.

378
00:34:21,078 --> 00:34:23,581
It wasn't me!

379
00:34:23,818 --> 00:34:25,623
It was Sonny and Ramon!

380
00:34:26,464 --> 00:34:29,259
She wanted to kill herself.

381
00:34:29,843 --> 00:34:31,636
Why are you asking me about it?

382
00:34:48,489 --> 00:34:50,452
Coach Saenz already told us.

383
00:34:51,617 --> 00:34:53,217
You can deny all you want.

384
00:34:54,036 --> 00:34:56,670
But the truth has its way of catching up.

385
00:35:00,039 --> 00:35:01,833
About what?

386
00:35:02,699 --> 00:35:04,827
That I raped Hannah's sister?

387
00:35:06,661 --> 00:35:08,288
Or that Ramon did it?

388
00:35:08,884 --> 00:35:10,842
Is that what you wanna hear?

389
00:35:13,055 --> 00:35:14,483
Come on.

390
00:35:16,316 --> 00:35:17,859
She was practically asking for it.

391
00:35:19,622 --> 00:35:22,374
She wanted to be in Potenciana.

392
00:35:23,847 --> 00:35:28,061
She was looking for someone
to take advantage of.

393
00:35:34,874 --> 00:35:37,053
Just like you.

394
00:35:38,247 --> 00:35:40,958
- Rot in hell! How about that?
- That's enough!

395
00:35:40,983 --> 00:35:44,506
- Get him out of here.
- Go.

396
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:56,468
I'm sorry, Gab.

397
00:35:56,548 --> 00:35:58,716
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

398
00:35:58,741 --> 00:36:00,743
But thank you.

399
00:36:01,310 --> 00:36:02,975
Thanks for...

400
00:36:03,876 --> 00:36:07,710
for fighting for Brian and me,
that we may get the justice we deserve.

401
00:36:08,106 --> 00:36:10,775
If you're not my friend,

402
00:36:11,467 --> 00:36:12,967
then at least you're my ally.

403
00:36:13,657 --> 00:36:15,772
That's how I see you.

404
00:36:25,547 --> 00:36:26,889
Emerson,

405
00:36:28,291 --> 00:36:29,654
he confessed.

406
00:36:30,716 --> 00:36:33,734
their circle had everything to do
with what happened to Christina.

407
00:36:40,601 --> 00:36:42,640
Emerson, we made a mistake.

408
00:36:43,604 --> 00:36:45,351
I made a mistake.

409
00:36:46,502 --> 00:36:49,422
Marion had nothing to
do with Brian's death.

410
00:36:51,541 --> 00:36:53,101
Hannah fooled us.

411
00:37:04,666 --> 00:37:07,382
I know it was difficult for us,

412
00:37:07,628 --> 00:37:10,339
to befriend her perpetrators,

413
00:37:12,470 --> 00:37:15,584
but I feel like the universe
conspired to help us.

414
00:37:16,707 --> 00:37:19,577
Because their loved ones,

415
00:37:20,682 --> 00:37:23,281
come up to me themselves.

416
00:37:25,129 --> 00:37:26,570
Are you ready?

417
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,882
I've prepared for this for
quite some time, Nancy.

418
00:37:35,239 --> 00:37:37,687
I've been waiting for this day for so long,

419
00:37:39,451 --> 00:37:42,234
to finally face Ramon Zuniga.

420
00:37:54,758 --> 00:37:59,513
Ms. Andal as part of our security measures
for Congressman Zuniga,

421
00:37:59,513 --> 00:38:00,848
I need to check your for weapons.

422
00:38:00,848 --> 00:38:01,883
Okay.

423
00:38:03,022 --> 00:38:04,062
Let me do that.

424
00:38:04,087 --> 00:38:06,180
So Hannah can be more comfortable.

425
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:08,063
Is that okay?

426
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,185
Sure.

427
00:38:09,967 --> 00:38:13,001
Please. Please, Ms. Arceo.

428
00:38:13,026 --> 00:38:15,344
Tell me what happened that night.
