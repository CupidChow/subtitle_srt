1
00:00:11,857 --> 00:00:13,275
Just like you,

2
00:00:13,596 --> 00:00:17,434
Hannah is also a victim of
these rich and powerful kids.

3
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:24,357
You're not just an addict,
you're a fucking rapist.

4
00:00:40,749 --> 00:00:42,959
To whoever knows her,

5
00:00:42,984 --> 00:00:46,296
to anybody close to her and her family,

6
00:00:46,321 --> 00:00:49,299
let's help Hannah recover faster.

7
00:00:49,872 --> 00:00:52,881
Wherever you are, we can go to you.

8
00:00:53,486 --> 00:00:55,405
Please.

9
00:00:55,430 --> 00:00:56,473
Message me.

10
00:01:08,636 --> 00:01:11,263
Did they find out who she is?

11
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:12,843
It was Gab.

12
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,115
How? How could she accuse me?

13
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:24,670
I guess she believed Brian wouldn't do
the things he's accused of.

14
00:01:24,695 --> 00:01:29,464
In fact, she's looking for your parents now
out of so much concern.

15
00:01:31,202 --> 00:01:32,615
She won't find anyone.

16
00:01:34,161 --> 00:01:36,365
And it hurts that

17
00:01:38,181 --> 00:01:40,391
she suffered the same fate as her sister

18
00:01:40,558 --> 00:01:43,645
who was just as unlucky

19
00:01:43,839 --> 00:01:45,442
at Potenciana.

20
00:01:46,189 --> 00:01:47,373
That's too bad.

21
00:01:48,895 --> 00:01:50,146
Sister?

22
00:01:50,171 --> 00:01:53,299
Hannah has a sister?

23
00:01:54,048 --> 00:01:56,300
What do you mean

24
00:01:56,709 --> 00:01:57,974
she was unlucky?

25
00:01:59,919 --> 00:02:01,982
She was raped at Potenciana.

26
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:11,517
Sister.

27
00:02:14,542 --> 00:02:16,168
Sister?

28
00:02:23,533 --> 00:02:25,035
Sister?

29
00:02:41,098 --> 00:02:45,435
Sister!!!

30
00:04:34,148 --> 00:04:35,819
Here they are.

31
00:04:37,777 --> 00:04:40,640
Always happy together.

32
00:04:42,907 --> 00:04:45,015
If you don't mind, how did Tina die?

33
00:04:46,828 --> 00:04:48,249
She took her own life.

34
00:04:49,927 --> 00:04:51,595
And since then,

35
00:04:52,079 --> 00:04:55,062
not once has Hannah smiled that way.

36
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:03,883
The rapists,

37
00:05:04,089 --> 00:05:05,757
were they caught?

38
00:05:07,265 --> 00:05:11,227
I don't know much about
what happened to Christina.

39
00:05:11,252 --> 00:05:12,878
But I heard,

40
00:05:13,127 --> 00:05:16,839
her mom took hush
money and settled the case.

41
00:05:17,524 --> 00:05:21,608
And that ruined Tina.

42
00:05:22,637 --> 00:05:23,971
Just think about it.

43
00:05:24,138 --> 00:05:27,975
How could her own mother not fight for her?

44
00:05:28,632 --> 00:05:31,844
Shame on her.

45
00:05:33,053 --> 00:05:35,389
How about their dad? Where is he?

46
00:05:36,807 --> 00:05:39,059
He left them a long time ago.

47
00:05:39,184 --> 00:05:43,647
That's why their mother
treated them that way.

48
00:05:44,189 --> 00:05:47,025
Like they were nothing but burden to her.

49
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:51,332
From my room,

50
00:05:51,572 --> 00:05:53,240
every single day,

51
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,786
I would hear Wilma tell her daughters that.

52
00:05:58,398 --> 00:06:02,611
I couldn't help but feel sorry for them.

53
00:06:04,852 --> 00:06:07,146
When Christina passed away,

54
00:06:07,310 --> 00:06:12,815
I decided to take care of Hannah.

55
00:06:12,840 --> 00:06:16,844
Especially because her mom
was in a relationship then.

56
00:06:17,712 --> 00:06:19,964
That man didn't look at
her like she was a child.

57
00:06:20,184 --> 00:06:23,145
You can easily see the lust in his eyes.

58
00:06:44,458 --> 00:06:50,422
What a horrible and painful
experience for them both.

59
00:06:54,593 --> 00:06:58,931
I understand why she'd
keep her past a secret.

60
00:06:59,139 --> 00:07:01,183
You said it yourself.

61
00:07:01,391 --> 00:07:03,894
It was horrible, and it was painful.

62
00:07:04,019 --> 00:07:07,606
Nobody deserves to feel that much pain.

63
00:07:09,399 --> 00:07:13,403
Before Hannah left for Potenciana,

64
00:07:13,987 --> 00:07:18,158
I saw a new and different
sparkle in her eyes.

65
00:07:18,575 --> 00:07:21,662
She looked hopeful.

66
00:07:22,037 --> 00:07:28,252
And I knew she wanted to
leave all her sorrows here.

67
00:07:28,852 --> 00:07:30,354
Finally,

68
00:07:30,379 --> 00:07:34,633
she had a chance at a
new life at San Lucas.

69
00:07:36,139 --> 00:07:37,926
Now that you're here,

70
00:07:38,739 --> 00:07:42,432
as a friend who cares about her,

71
00:07:43,892 --> 00:07:45,394
I guess,

72
00:07:45,812 --> 00:07:51,340
she got the new life I've
always wanted for her.

73
00:07:55,011 --> 00:07:57,794
Hearing Hannah's past,

74
00:07:58,782 --> 00:08:01,841
I feel closer to her.

75
00:08:03,328 --> 00:08:05,038
Thank you.

76
00:08:20,332 --> 00:08:22,692
I was with Brian that night.

77
00:08:25,767 --> 00:08:27,894
We were at the rooftop.

78
00:08:28,356 --> 00:08:31,246
I was trying to fix our relationship.

79
00:08:47,372 --> 00:08:49,666
Then Marion came.

80
00:08:51,460 --> 00:08:53,211
Fuck you!

81
00:08:54,442 --> 00:08:56,798
Marion!

82
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:02,763
He was enraged.

83
00:09:05,737 --> 00:09:08,281
No Marion!

84
00:09:14,051 --> 00:09:16,817
He hit Brian on the head.

85
00:09:22,371 --> 00:09:24,659
He tore off my clothes.

86
00:09:26,328 --> 00:09:28,520
I couldn't move.

87
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:44,285
He banged my head on the floor.

88
00:09:45,177 --> 00:09:47,596
I was bleeding...

89
00:09:48,558 --> 00:09:50,480
Brian tried to save my life.

90
00:09:53,702 --> 00:09:56,121
Before I passed out,

91
00:09:57,601 --> 00:09:59,152
I saw...

92
00:10:03,377 --> 00:10:05,394
I saw Marion holding...

93
00:10:06,034 --> 00:10:08,203
Brian's phone.

94
00:10:08,629 --> 00:10:11,754
Maybe that's how he
made Brian's "confession".

95
00:10:16,078 --> 00:10:19,511
I couldn't believe he would do that to us.

96
00:10:20,394 --> 00:10:22,590
Brian was his best friend.

97
00:10:24,195 --> 00:10:26,071
I'm sorry, Ms. Andal.

98
00:10:26,096 --> 00:10:30,183
But no one deserves what you experienced
at the hands of Marion Valles.

99
00:10:30,361 --> 00:10:33,364
It's not just Marion I
want to put behind bars,

100
00:10:33,728 --> 00:10:35,699
but also his brother,

101
00:10:37,879 --> 00:10:39,675
Sonny Valles.

102
00:10:40,944 --> 00:10:43,105
Why are you implicating his brother?

103
00:10:44,700 --> 00:10:47,863
Because he's Marion's drug source.

104
00:10:49,508 --> 00:10:51,093
That night,

105
00:10:51,580 --> 00:10:55,285
I saw Marion's eyes.

106
00:10:56,042 --> 00:10:58,683
He wasn't himself that night.

107
00:11:01,490 --> 00:11:03,940
I'm pretty sure he was high.

108
00:11:04,926 --> 00:11:06,918
That's why he did that to us.

109
00:11:07,525 --> 00:11:11,320
That's what made him attack us
like some vicious animal.

110
00:11:20,984 --> 00:11:23,401
Let me go! I'm innocent!

111
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:26,673
Hannah's lying! Let me go, fuck.

112
00:11:26,698 --> 00:11:29,576
Let me go! Fuck this.

113
00:11:29,601 --> 00:11:31,478
Sonny!

114
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,931
Fuck, what are we gonna do?

115
00:11:35,140 --> 00:11:37,476
Let's call dad.

116
00:11:37,501 --> 00:11:40,420
You know how they are.
They won't answer!

117
00:11:40,639 --> 00:11:42,892
They don't care about us.

118
00:11:42,917 --> 00:11:45,128
It's just you and me, little brother.

119
00:11:45,153 --> 00:11:49,230
- We can settle this.
- Sonny!

120
00:11:50,394 --> 00:11:52,479
Fuck this, Sonny!

121
00:11:52,504 --> 00:11:54,964
Brother!

122
00:11:55,426 --> 00:11:58,522
I'm fucking innocent!

123
00:11:58,522 --> 00:12:00,707
Let me go!

124
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:18,542
I was with Brian that night.

125
00:12:19,628 --> 00:12:21,339
We were at the rooftop.

126
00:12:21,891 --> 00:12:24,902
Because I was trying
to fix our relationship.

127
00:12:25,257 --> 00:12:27,759
And then Marion came.

128
00:12:29,112 --> 00:12:31,657
He was enraged.

129
00:12:33,019 --> 00:12:35,605
He hit Brian's head.

130
00:12:37,949 --> 00:12:42,357
And then...he tore my clothes off.

131
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,886
I couldn't move.

132
00:13:50,751 --> 00:13:53,044
Ha! Yes I'm in!

133
00:13:53,069 --> 00:13:55,074
I now have access to Hannah's cloud.

134
00:13:56,222 --> 00:14:00,402
Damn, that's a lot of videos.

135
00:14:01,186 --> 00:14:03,683
Alright, scroll down.

136
00:14:05,957 --> 00:14:07,792
Wait. This.

137
00:14:07,817 --> 00:14:10,528
- This one? Alright.
- Check the file date.

138
00:14:12,656 --> 00:14:15,496
Shit. Open it.

139
00:14:17,869 --> 00:14:19,871
Holy shit!

140
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,230
Boss, do I really have to see that?

141
00:15:01,692 --> 00:15:03,486
Come on, man.

142
00:15:05,417 --> 00:15:07,027
What a sight.

143
00:15:07,179 --> 00:15:08,388
I guess

144
00:15:08,433 --> 00:15:13,007
Hannah found out about what you did for her and Brian.

145
00:15:13,208 --> 00:15:14,793
She seems sincere.

146
00:15:15,736 --> 00:15:19,406
And after everything we found about her,

147
00:15:19,431 --> 00:15:21,641
and her struggles,

148
00:15:21,666 --> 00:15:25,437
I don't regret any of it.

149
00:15:26,201 --> 00:15:27,827
As for me,

150
00:15:28,440 --> 00:15:30,608
I'm grateful for Hannah.

151
00:15:30,887 --> 00:15:35,183
Because of her, we got to talk.

152
00:15:38,225 --> 00:15:41,976
Gab, about what happened earlier...

153
00:15:43,334 --> 00:15:47,006
Emerson, let's not complicate things.

154
00:15:51,504 --> 00:15:53,288
We were drunk

155
00:15:55,266 --> 00:15:58,477
and emotional

156
00:15:58,735 --> 00:16:01,488
and we just needed someone
to spend the night with, okay?

157
00:16:01,926 --> 00:16:04,554
That didn't mean anything.

158
00:16:12,634 --> 00:16:14,014
Jiggy sent a message.

159
00:16:14,727 --> 00:16:16,036
What did he say?

160
00:16:18,069 --> 00:16:19,741
Hannah is a fucking snake.

161
00:16:31,471 --> 00:16:32,848
What the fuck?

162
00:16:33,733 --> 00:16:36,100
That's our old principal!

163
00:16:38,780 --> 00:16:42,139
Shit. Even San Lucas'
old chief of police is here.

164
00:16:47,936 --> 00:16:53,116
Hannah waking up helped put Marion to jail
and cleared Brian's name

165
00:16:54,192 --> 00:16:57,570
but this is just the beginning
of another chapter to our story.

166
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,407
What secrets are you still keeping?

167
00:19:57,959 --> 00:19:59,794
Imagine.

168
00:20:00,128 --> 00:20:03,339
You and me together,

169
00:20:03,889 --> 00:20:05,658
for hours in bed.

170
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:11,973
We look out the window,
and the Eiffel Tower's right there.

171
00:20:12,423 --> 00:20:15,033
- Don't look too far ahead, love.
- It's exciting isn't it?

172
00:20:15,511 --> 00:20:19,849
Instead let's focus on how to get there
for your doctorate, okay?

173
00:20:19,874 --> 00:20:24,003
And you will be a very good med student.

174
00:20:25,061 --> 00:20:29,482
Just a few more work
to secure our documents,

175
00:20:29,507 --> 00:20:32,135
we can finally migrate to Paris.

176
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:38,207
Exactly. We'll be us. Not a
student and teacher together.

177
00:20:38,510 --> 00:20:42,825
No more judgmental looks from

178
00:20:42,825 --> 00:20:47,510
San Lucas' conservative eyes.

179
00:20:47,535 --> 00:20:50,636
And no more annoying suitor.

180
00:20:50,972 --> 00:20:53,653
Let's not ruin our day
by talking about him.

181
00:20:54,098 --> 00:20:56,864
Let's not talk about that asshole, okay?

182
00:20:58,288 --> 00:20:59,873
Okay, fine.

183
00:21:02,081 --> 00:21:07,712
You know love, I'm inspired by you
and our future together.

184
00:21:07,846 --> 00:21:10,182
And of course, that includes Hannah.

185
00:21:10,539 --> 00:21:13,542
She's actually very excited to meet you.

186
00:21:13,567 --> 00:21:18,614
She wants to know if you're as pretty
in person as you are in your photos.

187
00:21:19,123 --> 00:21:22,460
Of course I had to tell her
you're even more beautiful in person.

188
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:28,020
On a more serious note,

189
00:21:28,674 --> 00:21:32,720
I appreciate how understanding
you are of our situation.

190
00:21:33,070 --> 00:21:34,363
Why shouldn't I?

191
00:21:34,388 --> 00:21:37,905
When you love someone,

192
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:43,577
you give importance to what's
important to them too, right?

193
00:21:44,315 --> 00:21:45,871
You're right, love.

194
00:21:46,586 --> 00:21:48,499
I promise,

195
00:21:48,861 --> 00:21:51,614
I'll always take care of Hannah too.

196
00:21:52,423 --> 00:21:54,258
I love you, Tina.

197
00:21:54,283 --> 00:21:56,507
I love you too, Nancy.

198
00:22:52,508 --> 00:22:55,469
There's no business to finish, really.

199
00:22:55,494 --> 00:23:00,791
- If only I was there with your sister.
- That's enough.

200
00:23:01,277 --> 00:23:02,907
Don't say that, Nancy.

201
00:23:03,644 --> 00:23:07,273
Playing it in your head over and over
won't change anything.

202
00:23:08,180 --> 00:23:10,206
You didn't do anything wrong.

203
00:23:12,328 --> 00:23:14,705
And you've always done
everything for my sister.

204
00:23:28,289 --> 00:23:32,313
Christina? Christina.

205
00:23:32,338 --> 00:23:36,093
- What happened? What's wrong?
- My key...

206
00:23:36,118 --> 00:23:42,450
- The key...where's my key...
- What are you talking about?

207
00:23:42,475 --> 00:23:46,329
Where's my key?

208
00:23:46,354 --> 00:23:50,203
- The key...
- Christina, what happened to you?

209
00:23:50,228 --> 00:23:52,940
My key...

210
00:24:01,613 --> 00:24:05,325
What happened to you?

211
00:24:20,349 --> 00:24:22,643
I was walking up the stairs

212
00:24:23,106 --> 00:24:25,406
but someone grabbed me.

213
00:24:27,478 --> 00:24:30,286
It was dark for a moment.

214
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:34,206
Carlo Saenz,

215
00:24:35,069 --> 00:24:39,323
I remember seeing him.
He was driving the car.

216
00:24:40,507 --> 00:24:41,669
Ramon!

217
00:24:43,727 --> 00:24:46,289
Have fun my friends!

218
00:24:47,697 --> 00:24:49,574
Enough!

219
00:24:51,961 --> 00:24:55,214
Let me go!

220
00:25:13,190 --> 00:25:16,944
Sub? Sub? That's the jackpot right there.

221
00:25:22,867 --> 00:25:26,414
- Let her go, man.
- Fuck you!

222
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:29,332
That's enough!

223
00:25:43,888 --> 00:25:46,891
- Dude, please!
- Don't tell me what to do!

224
00:25:48,768 --> 00:25:50,019
Ramon!

225
00:25:54,891 --> 00:25:57,281
Ramon Zuniga was there too.

226
00:25:59,353 --> 00:26:02,899
I heard his voice even
when we were still in the car.

227
00:26:04,675 --> 00:26:08,888
I'm also sure Ramon
was talking to Sonny Valles

228
00:26:08,913 --> 00:26:11,406
about where they brought me.

229
00:26:13,501 --> 00:26:18,839
He was the one who encouraged Ramon
to do what they did to me.

230
00:26:21,086 --> 00:26:23,399
I beg you.

231
00:26:25,152 --> 00:26:27,530
Help me.

232
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:31,641
- Please help me put them in jail.
- Chief.

233
00:26:42,060 --> 00:26:46,922
Dear, it's not that we're ignoring you,

234
00:26:49,487 --> 00:26:54,108
but all we have are
circumstantial evidence.

235
00:26:55,490 --> 00:26:58,017
We need a direct evidence.

236
00:26:59,198 --> 00:27:02,709
We can't just arrest those
people you're accusing.

237
00:27:02,709 --> 00:27:03,709
Sir.

238
00:27:04,610 --> 00:27:07,192
You're the chief of police.

239
00:27:09,163 --> 00:27:11,833
Are you really taking this lightly?

240
00:27:11,858 --> 00:27:15,404
Does she look like she's lying?

241
00:27:16,061 --> 00:27:17,395
Dean,

242
00:27:18,122 --> 00:27:19,872
you can't let them get away with this.

243
00:27:21,116 --> 00:27:24,126
She's also a student of Potenciana.

244
00:27:25,793 --> 00:27:28,380
We can't let this slide.

245
00:27:29,254 --> 00:27:31,759
We need to protect this student.

246
00:27:34,472 --> 00:27:35,890
Ms. Arceo,

247
00:27:36,309 --> 00:27:38,640
I really didn't want to get involved,

248
00:27:39,086 --> 00:27:41,393
but you heard the chief.

249
00:27:42,047 --> 00:27:43,520
Let them do their job.

250
00:27:44,041 --> 00:27:46,004
They know what they're doing.

251
00:27:49,423 --> 00:27:52,301
Those monsters Zuniga and Valles,

252
00:27:52,696 --> 00:27:54,698
and their henchmen,

253
00:27:55,519 --> 00:27:57,062
it's them.

254
00:27:57,922 --> 00:27:59,828
They're the ones who need to pay.

255
00:28:01,830 --> 00:28:03,457
You wouldn't have known

256
00:28:03,921 --> 00:28:07,383
if Zuniga and Valles have
already filled their pockets.

257
00:28:07,715 --> 00:28:10,422
Even that reporter Hizon.

258
00:28:11,118 --> 00:28:15,928
I didn't know why we wasted our time
asking for help from him.

259
00:28:16,663 --> 00:28:19,014
You said you were going to help me.

260
00:28:20,269 --> 00:28:22,563
Why is it not on your paper?

261
00:28:22,588 --> 00:28:24,677
Where's the important part?

262
00:28:26,733 --> 00:28:29,983
Why didn't you name those rapists?

263
00:28:30,114 --> 00:28:33,326
I'm in a hurry. I don't
have time to talk to you.

264
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:37,061
- Mr. Hizon!
- Sir!

265
00:28:40,313 --> 00:28:42,120
How much did they pay you?

266
00:28:43,479 --> 00:28:44,790
Joey.

267
00:28:51,327 --> 00:28:54,967
Let's just not wallow in our sorrows.

268
00:28:56,491 --> 00:29:02,432
God wouldn't have let us crossed paths,
if not to give my sister justice.

269
00:29:04,755 --> 00:29:08,092
Sister!!!

270
00:29:08,117 --> 00:29:09,702
Tina...

271
00:29:10,073 --> 00:29:11,942
I'm on the honor roll, just like you were.

272
00:29:12,565 --> 00:29:14,945
I told you I'd make it, didn't I?

273
00:29:15,789 --> 00:29:20,242
As promised, I'm determined
to follow your footsteps.

274
00:29:21,149 --> 00:29:23,579
I was accepted at Potenciana too.

275
00:29:23,941 --> 00:29:25,693
On scholarship, just like you were.

276
00:29:25,917 --> 00:29:28,625
You were right, sis.

277
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:31,170
Potenciana's huge.

278
00:29:31,949 --> 00:29:34,326
I'm happy to have visited it, finally.

279
00:29:35,010 --> 00:29:38,594
So when school starts, I won't get lost.

280
00:29:39,348 --> 00:29:42,476
I found each one of them too.

281
00:29:42,501 --> 00:29:46,480
I'll bring them to justice
one by one for you.

282
00:29:49,336 --> 00:29:50,939
Watch me, okay?

283
00:29:52,820 --> 00:29:54,697
I hope you enjoy it.

284
00:29:54,947 --> 00:29:56,740
And I hope it makes you happy.

285
00:29:56,765 --> 00:29:59,351
Because it's time to punish them.

286
00:30:34,923 --> 00:30:36,610
Now this is what I'm talking about.

287
00:30:38,484 --> 00:30:40,280
I haven't even ordered,

288
00:30:41,763 --> 00:30:43,659
but I'm already served a hot meal.

289
00:30:47,988 --> 00:30:49,039
Hannah.

290
00:30:52,988 --> 00:30:54,127
Hi, Hannah.

291
00:30:57,988 --> 00:31:02,010
Order anything you want, okay? I got it.

292
00:31:03,332 --> 00:31:05,347
I collected a hefty one earlier.

293
00:31:11,009 --> 00:31:12,354
I'm going to take a piss.

294
00:31:17,930 --> 00:31:19,056
Stay there.

295
00:31:20,015 --> 00:31:21,475
I'll be right back.

296
00:31:33,387 --> 00:31:36,220
That's exactly what I tell my subordinates.

297
00:31:37,916 --> 00:31:40,507
You have to get along well with the rich.

298
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:44,011
That's the secret

299
00:31:44,832 --> 00:31:47,180
to keeping this job.

300
00:31:48,727 --> 00:31:52,019
You know sometimes,

301
00:31:52,417 --> 00:31:55,647
being shady is required
to adapt to the job.

302
00:31:57,511 --> 00:32:00,931
Because if you stay a goody-two-shoes

303
00:32:01,565 --> 00:32:06,241
those rich monsters will devour you alive.

304
00:32:07,463 --> 00:32:08,660
You get it?

305
00:32:09,739 --> 00:32:10,811
Hey.

306
00:32:11,817 --> 00:32:13,751
You've been checking
your phone for a while now.

307
00:32:13,759 --> 00:32:16,196
Are you waiting for a
text from your boyfriend?

308
00:32:16,631 --> 00:32:19,296
No, I was just checking the time.

309
00:32:19,466 --> 00:32:21,593
- Where were we?
- Bullshit.

310
00:32:21,994 --> 00:32:23,759
Show me your phone.

311
00:32:26,323 --> 00:32:27,742
Why?

312
00:32:28,476 --> 00:32:32,100
I said give it to me.
I just want to see it.

313
00:32:33,422 --> 00:32:34,561
Hand me the phone.

314
00:32:37,252 --> 00:32:38,645
Are you gonna hand it or what?

315
00:32:39,986 --> 00:32:41,780
Let me fucking see it.

316
00:32:41,805 --> 00:32:44,016
- Were you fucking recording me?!
- That's mine.

317
00:32:44,057 --> 00:32:45,851
- Why are you fucking spying on me?!
- I said that's mine!

318
00:32:45,851 --> 00:32:47,686
- Who sent you, huh?!
- Give me my phone.

319
00:32:47,728 --> 00:32:49,188
Bitch!

320
00:32:52,339 --> 00:32:53,590
Fuck you bitch!

321
00:32:55,152 --> 00:32:56,528
Give it to me.

322
00:32:57,383 --> 00:33:01,011
Fuck you! Fucking cunt!

323
00:33:03,920 --> 00:33:06,080
Who fucking sent you?!

324
00:33:08,704 --> 00:33:10,122
Motherfucker.

325
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,551
Fucking bitch!

326
00:33:35,391 --> 00:33:36,475
Hannah!

327
00:33:51,836 --> 00:33:53,212
Let's go.

328
00:33:53,734 --> 00:33:54,813
Dickhead.

329
00:34:01,223 --> 00:34:04,526
I know it was difficult for us,

330
00:34:05,339 --> 00:34:08,113
to befriend her perpetrators,

331
00:34:09,409 --> 00:34:12,033
but I feel like the universe
conspired to help us.

332
00:34:20,492 --> 00:34:22,961
I only want Brian!

333
00:34:32,911 --> 00:34:36,224
Rape! Help!

334
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:49,827
I'm sorry, Gab.

335
00:34:50,695 --> 00:34:53,262
I'm sorry you had to go through that.

336
00:34:54,743 --> 00:34:56,369
But thank you.

337
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,020
Thanks for...

338
00:34:59,539 --> 00:35:03,918
for fighting for Brian and me.
That we may get the justice we deserve.

339
00:35:13,688 --> 00:35:17,349
Hannah, don't be scared.

340
00:35:27,449 --> 00:35:29,481
If you want more truth,

341
00:35:30,713 --> 00:35:32,590
Have me as a guest on your live stream.

342
00:35:33,391 --> 00:35:35,059
I'll tell you everything.
