1
00:00:12,637 --> 00:00:15,751
I'm going to fulfill my sister's dream.

2
00:00:16,236 --> 00:00:18,238
I will go to France.

3
00:00:18,263 --> 00:00:20,087
Your bracelet's cute.

4
00:00:22,193 --> 00:00:25,154
My best friend gave this to me years ago.

5
00:00:25,179 --> 00:00:27,181
Paris is the city of love.

6
00:00:27,206 --> 00:00:28,916
It's Ms. Arceo.

7
00:00:28,941 --> 00:00:32,653
She was an assistant adviser
to Potenciana Cares. Christina...

8
00:00:33,029 --> 00:00:35,349
Emerson, isn't this Christina?

9
00:00:47,813 --> 00:00:51,689
If we work hard for it,
then our documents are secured.

10
00:00:51,783 --> 00:00:54,285
And we'll be able to migrate to Paris.

11
00:00:54,378 --> 00:01:00,927
Exactly. And we'll be free to be us,
not a student or a teacher.

12
00:01:03,646 --> 00:01:06,758
Dude! I don't wanna be a part of this!

13
00:01:08,943 --> 00:01:10,111
Ramon!

14
00:01:10,403 --> 00:01:13,656
I found each one of them too.

15
00:01:13,881 --> 00:01:17,843
I'll bring them to justice
one by one for you.

16
00:01:25,264 --> 00:01:26,862
Hannah' sister,

17
00:01:27,381 --> 00:01:28,469
Christina.

18
00:01:29,464 --> 00:01:31,909
Coach Saenz already told us.

19
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:34,594
You can deny all you want.

20
00:01:35,084 --> 00:01:37,503
But the truth has its way of catching up.

21
00:01:41,117 --> 00:01:42,878
About what?

22
00:01:43,812 --> 00:01:46,089
That I raped Hannah's sister?

23
00:01:47,398 --> 00:01:49,109
Emerson.

24
00:01:50,110 --> 00:01:51,512
He confessed.

25
00:01:51,778 --> 00:01:54,614
All of them were involved
with Christina's incident.

26
00:01:54,718 --> 00:01:56,678
Emerson we made a mistake.

27
00:01:57,612 --> 00:01:59,614
I made a mistake.

28
00:02:00,576 --> 00:02:03,273
Marion had nothing to
do with Brian's death.

29
00:02:05,291 --> 00:02:07,210
We were duped by Hannah.

30
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,657
Bri!

31
00:02:12,257 --> 00:02:15,426
-My Name is Brian Zuniga, 19 years old,
- Hey stop taking photos!

32
00:02:15,566 --> 00:02:18,193
- sophomore student, dead.
- Hey stop that! Leave it alone!

33
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:20,512
- And you know what they say...
- Stop it, stop! Enough!

34
00:02:20,537 --> 00:02:22,934
- the dead don't lie.
- Fuck it. I said stop taking photos!

35
00:02:22,976 --> 00:02:26,146
So everything I'm
about to tell you are true.

36
00:02:26,171 --> 00:02:29,976
Starting with that
night, Barrister's Night.

37
00:02:47,601 --> 00:02:48,853
On second thought,

38
00:02:49,192 --> 00:02:51,616
let's go back to a few weeks earlier...

39
00:02:51,641 --> 00:02:55,353
to one of the happiest moments of my life,

40
00:02:55,525 --> 00:02:58,319
when I was with the woman who changed me.

41
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:00,039
Sweet.

42
00:03:00,118 --> 00:03:01,453
Light.

43
00:03:01,759 --> 00:03:05,263
It's not as bitter as
the one we had earlier.

44
00:03:05,643 --> 00:03:07,103
That's Merlot.

45
00:03:07,145 --> 00:03:09,570
It's known for its soft and sensual notes.

46
00:03:10,815 --> 00:03:13,445
My Dad told me once,

47
00:03:14,986 --> 00:03:19,249
talking about wine is the
easiest means to small talk.

48
00:03:19,657 --> 00:03:23,370
So once you're a famous journalist

49
00:03:23,370 --> 00:03:26,366
meeting a lot of people,
this could help you socialize.

50
00:03:28,249 --> 00:03:30,922
The way you say it, you seem
to know it will surely happen.

51
00:03:30,922 --> 00:03:31,922
Of course!

52
00:03:33,382 --> 00:03:35,051
Because I believe in you.

53
00:03:35,991 --> 00:03:38,368
I know how good you are.

54
00:03:39,903 --> 00:03:41,487
You're drunk.

55
00:03:41,638 --> 00:03:43,848
- Drunk?
- You're really drunk.

56
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:46,609
No, I'm still okay.

57
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,116
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

58
00:03:53,086 --> 00:03:55,255
- Mmm.
- Mmm!

59
00:04:01,240 --> 00:04:02,783
Uhm...

60
00:04:04,509 --> 00:04:05,827
Well...

61
00:04:07,509 --> 00:04:08,760
Thanks?

62
00:04:08,785 --> 00:04:11,370
Thank you for the lesson.

63
00:04:11,574 --> 00:04:15,119
And for your parents for
taking you around the world.

64
00:04:15,176 --> 00:04:19,013
Because of them, you were
able to learn all those things.

65
00:04:20,003 --> 00:04:21,508
Well, yes.

66
00:04:22,049 --> 00:04:26,241
Those 2 weeks in a year, that's
the only time we're with our parents.

67
00:04:27,562 --> 00:04:29,366
Because they're always busy.

68
00:04:30,152 --> 00:04:33,321
More often than not,

69
00:04:33,526 --> 00:04:35,555
my brother and I would
just stay in the hotel.

70
00:04:35,903 --> 00:04:37,571
It's sad, right?

71
00:04:37,596 --> 00:04:39,807
It was supposed to be family time but,

72
00:04:40,045 --> 00:04:43,631
they just couldn't find time for us.

73
00:04:44,677 --> 00:04:46,012
Aww.

74
00:04:47,370 --> 00:04:52,093
Poor Mr. Zuniga.

75
00:04:52,971 --> 00:04:54,848
But come on,

76
00:04:54,937 --> 00:04:57,940
your parents still took you to Europe.

77
00:04:58,591 --> 00:05:01,928
I mean, even if it's
just in the hotel room,

78
00:05:01,991 --> 00:05:05,453
- it's still in Europe.
- Yes, I know.

79
00:05:05,478 --> 00:05:07,063
Think about this.

80
00:05:07,469 --> 00:05:11,598
You own a yacht that you
can sail anytime you want.

81
00:05:11,855 --> 00:05:12,981
Right?

82
00:05:13,423 --> 00:05:17,843
I think you should be thankful,

83
00:05:18,992 --> 00:05:22,829
because despite your parents' limited time,

84
00:05:22,854 --> 00:05:25,460
they still gave it to you and your brother.

85
00:05:29,369 --> 00:05:33,165
You've been talking about your
mom and dad for a while now.

86
00:05:33,999 --> 00:05:37,015
So I think, even though

87
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:41,299
the time you spent were cut short,
it had a huge impact on you.

88
00:05:41,324 --> 00:05:45,203
It was that memorable for you.

89
00:05:45,553 --> 00:05:47,805
- Right?
- Right.

90
00:05:48,473 --> 00:05:50,099
Thank you.

91
00:05:51,142 --> 00:05:52,226
For what?

92
00:05:52,807 --> 00:05:54,684
For always speaking your mind.

93
00:05:54,897 --> 00:05:57,275
For being honest with me.

94
00:05:58,207 --> 00:06:01,084
You're welcome, Mr. Zuniga.

95
00:06:05,834 --> 00:06:08,101
- Cheers?
- Cheers.

96
00:06:17,115 --> 00:06:18,408
Delicious.

97
00:06:19,049 --> 00:06:21,249
Wait, let me see.

98
00:06:22,548 --> 00:06:24,015
If you're not drunk,

99
00:06:24,816 --> 00:06:28,403
What are the 5 S of wine tasting?

100
00:06:32,365 --> 00:06:34,280
See the color,

101
00:06:35,436 --> 00:06:37,616
- swirl...
- Okay.

102
00:06:39,197 --> 00:06:40,319
sniff,

103
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:45,245
sip and savor.

104
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:49,714
Wow! Very good, Ms. San Andres.

105
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:52,745
Give it to me.

106
00:06:53,162 --> 00:06:55,839
I have one more S

107
00:06:56,280 --> 00:06:58,240
I haven't taught you yet.

108
00:06:58,396 --> 00:06:59,856
Huh?

109
00:07:00,254 --> 00:07:01,385
What is it?

110
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,925
Mhmm.

111
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:07,770
Come.

112
00:07:09,452 --> 00:07:10,729
Sway.

113
00:07:12,723 --> 00:07:15,331
Unfortunately, a week later,

114
00:07:15,546 --> 00:07:20,510
I found out a secret about Hannah,
that destroyed my relationship with Gab.

115
00:07:21,635 --> 00:07:22,995
We're done.

116
00:07:23,548 --> 00:07:24,752
Gab.

117
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:26,446
It's over.

118
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,115
Gab.

119
00:07:29,888 --> 00:07:31,473
Gab!

120
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:32,921
But that night, I was
sure I was fixing things.

121
00:08:37,745 --> 00:08:41,222
- Watch it!
- Gab!

122
00:08:42,578 --> 00:08:45,748
You wanna make another sex video with me?

123
00:08:45,773 --> 00:08:47,775
Creep!

124
00:08:51,977 --> 00:08:53,267
Shit.

125
00:08:58,277 --> 00:08:59,695
Emerson.

126
00:09:00,159 --> 00:09:02,286
Hello? Where did you go?

127
00:09:02,609 --> 00:09:04,236
The party just started.

128
00:09:04,261 --> 00:09:07,181
I just need to take care
of something real quick.

129
00:09:07,418 --> 00:09:08,711
Bro?

130
00:09:08,736 --> 00:09:10,292
I have a favor to ask.

131
00:09:10,805 --> 00:09:13,511
If you see Gab San Andres,

132
00:09:14,561 --> 00:09:16,187
can you...

133
00:09:17,504 --> 00:09:19,506
can you keep an eye on her for me?

134
00:09:24,438 --> 00:09:29,698
But I was wrong. It was Hannah all along
who had other plans for me.

135
00:09:29,723 --> 00:09:30,803
Hannah.

136
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,957
Fuck me.

137
00:09:57,080 --> 00:09:58,665
Hannah!

138
00:10:01,648 --> 00:10:03,814
Can you stop pretending now?

139
00:10:04,584 --> 00:10:08,758
- What's up with you?
- I know who you are and I know your plans about my family.

140
00:10:10,610 --> 00:10:13,064
- So please.
- What are you talking about?

141
00:10:13,558 --> 00:10:15,768
Just stop this Hannah!

142
00:10:16,125 --> 00:10:18,627
I know you're doing this for your sister.

143
00:10:19,198 --> 00:10:23,619
So stop dragging me and my family
or else I'll fucking expose you!

144
00:10:23,827 --> 00:10:24,912
What?

145
00:10:25,549 --> 00:10:29,678
Please don't make excuses
when you just want to break up with me.

146
00:10:31,338 --> 00:10:34,916
I'll make sure you go straight to jail.

147
00:10:37,257 --> 00:10:40,719
You won't have any face to show.

148
00:10:41,386 --> 00:10:45,432
- I know you're having an affair with Gab.
- You're crazy.

149
00:10:45,641 --> 00:10:47,309
You're insane!

150
00:10:48,977 --> 00:10:50,689
- Seriously?
- Hannah!

151
00:10:52,413 --> 00:10:53,665
Enough!

152
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,985
- Rape! Help!
- What did you say? Hannah! Please!

153
00:10:58,132 --> 00:11:00,301
Rape!

154
00:13:02,986 --> 00:13:05,696
I'm surprised to see you, Gab.

155
00:13:06,907 --> 00:13:08,813
What are you doing here?

156
00:13:10,728 --> 00:13:12,024
How can I help you?

157
00:13:14,396 --> 00:13:16,649
I just wanted to ask something.

158
00:13:17,751 --> 00:13:18,907
What is it?

159
00:13:20,299 --> 00:13:22,773
It's about your best friend, Christina.

160
00:13:25,659 --> 00:13:27,821
I don't know what you're talking about.

161
00:13:36,790 --> 00:13:39,272
In the yearbooks we saw,

162
00:13:39,838 --> 00:13:42,016
you and Christina had
a lot of photos together.

163
00:13:43,302 --> 00:13:45,763
You really are close.

164
00:13:46,437 --> 00:13:49,437
So you've known Hannah all along?

165
00:13:50,200 --> 00:13:53,009
I don't see what my friendship with
Hannah's sister has to do with you.

166
00:13:53,704 --> 00:13:56,665
What's your point, Ms. San Andres?

167
00:13:58,083 --> 00:14:00,419
Hannah told me

168
00:14:00,752 --> 00:14:03,755
about what happened to Christina

169
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:11,596
at the hands of Ramon Zuniga,
Sonny Valles, and Coach Saenz.

170
00:14:12,514 --> 00:14:15,415
From the look of your face right now,

171
00:14:16,384 --> 00:14:21,102
I'm guessing Hannah isn't
the only one holding a grudge.

172
00:14:24,963 --> 00:14:27,508
You amaze me, Ms. Arceo.

173
00:14:30,323 --> 00:14:32,367
All this time,

174
00:14:33,827 --> 00:14:37,456
you've been so close to
your loved one's perpetrators.

175
00:14:38,832 --> 00:14:42,586
You ignored what they did,
and you acted as if nothing is up.

176
00:14:43,714 --> 00:14:44,813
Why?

177
00:14:46,757 --> 00:14:48,508
To set them up for the long game?

178
00:14:50,087 --> 00:14:54,344
While you wait for right
time and day to take revenge?

179
00:14:58,769 --> 00:15:00,687
I guess who ever said it was right.

180
00:15:01,196 --> 00:15:04,733
Keep your friends close,
and your enemies closer.

181
00:15:06,318 --> 00:15:07,402
Wow.

182
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:11,156
You're reaching Ms. San Andres.

183
00:15:13,707 --> 00:15:16,485
I understand you, Ms. Arceo.

184
00:15:17,287 --> 00:15:19,456
You're wasting my time.

185
00:15:19,998 --> 00:15:22,417
Really, I do.

186
00:15:23,877 --> 00:15:31,626
I've been there too.
I know how hard it is to stand up to them.

187
00:15:36,014 --> 00:15:39,976
That's why you used
Hannah to get them, right?

188
00:15:41,311 --> 00:15:42,860
Shut up!

189
00:15:44,856 --> 00:15:50,509
And don't throw some
accusations at me, Ms. San Andres.

190
00:15:50,779 --> 00:15:53,735
Otherwise, I'm gonna sue you for slander.

191
00:15:55,784 --> 00:15:57,696
I'm sorry, Ms. Arceo.

192
00:15:58,887 --> 00:16:02,907
I'm so sorry I have to tell you this.

193
00:16:04,584 --> 00:16:07,629
But your plan didn't work.

194
00:16:07,796 --> 00:16:09,422
You failed.

195
00:16:10,702 --> 00:16:14,618
Marion and Sonny Valles walk free.

196
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:19,307
All charges against them have been dropped.

197
00:16:21,726 --> 00:16:22,811
What?

198
00:16:25,515 --> 00:16:27,461
You're lying.

199
00:16:38,126 --> 00:16:40,501
Emerson sent this to me earlier.

200
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:43,707
Idiots, am I right?

201
00:16:44,207 --> 00:16:46,668
Guilty assholes who
act like they did nothing.

202
00:16:47,337 --> 00:16:52,007
Heartbreaking isn't it, Ms. Arceo?
Take a good look.

203
00:16:52,207 --> 00:16:56,618
They're free and that's it.

204
00:16:58,889 --> 00:17:00,515
No.

205
00:17:01,001 --> 00:17:03,351
This can't happen.

206
00:17:03,376 --> 00:17:09,626
We made sure they couldn't get away,
we made sure!

207
00:17:11,860 --> 00:17:14,321
Poor Christina.

208
00:17:17,073 --> 00:17:20,410
I guess this is what she went through too.

209
00:17:21,297 --> 00:17:23,925
Fuck them!

210
00:17:26,181 --> 00:17:29,025
They can't get away with this!

211
00:17:34,006 --> 00:17:40,179
Fuck you too! If you hadn't meddled,
this would have been done long ago!

212
00:17:48,813 --> 00:17:50,948
Did you hear that?

213
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:14,101
Ms. Arceo, please. I beg you.
Think about Hannah.

214
00:18:14,591 --> 00:18:16,284
Think about Christina.

215
00:18:17,257 --> 00:18:19,807
You used her sister

216
00:18:20,637 --> 00:18:25,016
and when you had the chance
to save Hannah, you didn't take it.

217
00:18:25,600 --> 00:18:28,315
How do you think Christina would feel?

218
00:18:29,896 --> 00:18:35,612
Please. Please, Ms. Arceo.
Tell me what happened that night.

219
00:18:41,305 --> 00:18:43,474
Oh babe!

220
00:18:47,540 --> 00:18:49,667
Shit.

221
00:18:52,006 --> 00:18:54,409
Oh babe, I love it.

222
00:18:55,630 --> 00:18:57,090
You two!

223
00:18:57,257 --> 00:19:00,343
- Sorry, Ms. Arceo!
- It's not what it looks like!

224
00:19:00,343 --> 00:19:02,762
Principal's office, Monday.

225
00:19:04,307 --> 00:19:06,850
Where could Hannah be?

226
00:19:10,987 --> 00:19:12,689
Rape!

227
00:19:17,764 --> 00:19:21,190
- Rape! Help!
- Hannah!

228
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:24,775
Where...

229
00:21:09,688 --> 00:21:16,229
Hannah? Hannah!
What happened? Hannah...

230
00:21:17,675 --> 00:21:25,643
Hannah... What happened
to you? Hannah! Help!

231
00:21:36,898 --> 00:21:41,337
Ms. Andal as part of our security measures
for Congressman Zuniga,

232
00:21:41,392 --> 00:21:43,853
- I need to check you for weapons.
- Okay.

233
00:21:45,275 --> 00:21:46,317
Let me do that.

234
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:48,553
So Hannah can be more comfortable.

235
00:21:49,124 --> 00:21:50,194
Is that okay?

236
00:21:50,263 --> 00:21:51,389
- Sure.
- Alright, sir.

237
00:21:55,435 --> 00:21:56,978
Thank you, Congressman.

238
00:21:57,488 --> 00:21:59,740
For meeting me.

239
00:22:00,358 --> 00:22:01,526
Don't mention it.

240
00:22:02,483 --> 00:22:04,319
After everything that has happened,

241
00:22:04,638 --> 00:22:07,015
I feel more connected
with you because of Brian.

242
00:22:08,332 --> 00:22:09,625
Now I see,

243
00:22:11,002 --> 00:22:15,214
why my brother was head over heels for you.

244
00:22:20,210 --> 00:22:21,753
Sorry.

245
00:22:21,906 --> 00:22:23,658
Please, take a seat.

246
00:22:30,996 --> 00:22:34,933
Sorry we had to frisk you a while ago.

247
00:22:36,387 --> 00:22:40,230
With politics, you can
never be too careful.

248
00:22:40,715 --> 00:22:45,193
You never know when your
enemies are gonna show up.

249
00:22:46,361 --> 00:22:51,348
Am I right, Ms. Hannah Paraiso?

250
00:22:57,013 --> 00:22:59,199
So you already know who I am.

251
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:04,858
Of course.

252
00:23:05,841 --> 00:23:07,426
I'm not stupid.

253
00:23:08,364 --> 00:23:10,408
After Brian's death,

254
00:23:10,608 --> 00:23:12,277
Carlos was hit first,

255
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:14,471
and Sonny came next.

256
00:23:16,205 --> 00:23:20,129
You've been on their
tails for quite some time.

257
00:23:22,605 --> 00:23:23,871
But I must admit,

258
00:23:25,149 --> 00:23:28,653
using your stepfather's
name was a good move.

259
00:23:28,678 --> 00:23:30,430
That got me stuck for a while.

260
00:23:34,291 --> 00:23:36,668
So why did you agree to meet me?

261
00:23:37,936 --> 00:23:41,231
Why didn't you just
report me to the police?

262
00:23:45,503 --> 00:23:47,755
Because that was an election year.

263
00:23:49,140 --> 00:23:53,227
And I didn't want you
dragging my name into the mud.

264
00:23:56,889 --> 00:24:01,192
Is that the same reason why
our case was closed quickly?

265
00:24:03,129 --> 00:24:04,630
Don't get me wrong.

266
00:24:04,783 --> 00:24:06,368
I love my brother,

267
00:24:06,816 --> 00:24:09,590
but he is gone.

268
00:24:11,192 --> 00:24:13,069
I know him very well.

269
00:24:13,990 --> 00:24:21,205
He wouldn't want our name to be tarnished.

270
00:24:25,581 --> 00:24:27,958
And that's the only thing
that matters to you, right?

271
00:24:36,011 --> 00:24:37,471
Of course.

272
00:24:37,496 --> 00:24:39,832
This is our legacy.

273
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,559
And I will do everything
in my power to protect it.

274
00:24:46,285 --> 00:24:47,327
Here.

275
00:24:50,485 --> 00:24:52,362
5 million pesos.

276
00:24:56,177 --> 00:24:57,387
Is that enough?

277
00:25:02,413 --> 00:25:04,457
This is enough.

278
00:25:09,170 --> 00:25:11,381
Living in Paris is costly.

279
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,602
Besides, this is what my
sister has always wanted.

280
00:25:15,343 --> 00:25:18,679
And it's just right that you pay for it.

281
00:25:19,388 --> 00:25:21,056
That sound's fair.

282
00:25:22,109 --> 00:25:23,576
You know what, Hannah?

283
00:25:23,601 --> 00:25:25,186
You're not just smart,

284
00:25:26,396 --> 00:25:29,482
but you're also practical. And,

285
00:25:32,235 --> 00:25:33,986
that's what I like.

286
00:25:36,114 --> 00:25:38,491
If your sister was anything like you,

287
00:25:38,516 --> 00:25:42,820
and she just did what I wanted,

288
00:25:43,389 --> 00:25:46,058
I would have given her everything.

289
00:25:49,585 --> 00:25:52,088
Allow me to show you my gratitude.

290
00:25:54,257 --> 00:25:59,265
Now this is definitely
why my brother liked you.

291
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:02,530
You were right.

292
00:26:02,983 --> 00:26:05,647
My sister and I are different.

293
00:26:08,351 --> 00:26:10,879
Back then when we'd find
ourselves in the middle of a fight,

294
00:26:11,077 --> 00:26:12,996
she'd stop me.

295
00:26:13,943 --> 00:26:15,987
She thought I was too short tempered.

296
00:26:17,193 --> 00:26:19,236
But she's gone.

297
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:22,013
Nobody can stop me now!

298
00:26:45,183 --> 00:26:47,518
And you took her from me.

299
00:26:47,768 --> 00:26:52,607
There is nobody to blame here but you!

300
00:27:42,809 --> 00:27:44,978
Just make sure it's good.

301
00:27:45,620 --> 00:27:48,772
- For the Congressman
- Where is Hannah Andal?

302
00:27:51,203 --> 00:27:52,648
Congressman!

303
00:27:54,919 --> 00:28:00,922
Thank you for those who tipped us
about Hannah Andal's whereabouts.

304
00:28:01,425 --> 00:28:04,887
The police are currently on
their way to the Zuniga estate.

305
00:28:05,930 --> 00:28:07,557
Don't worry guys,

306
00:28:07,667 --> 00:28:09,419
I will keep you updated.

307
00:28:20,278 --> 00:28:22,154
- Emerson?
- Gab.

308
00:28:22,363 --> 00:28:23,698
Did they find Hannah?

309
00:28:23,850 --> 00:28:26,770
Ramon is dead and Hannah is missing.

310
00:29:04,101 --> 00:29:05,936
Don't be scared.

311
00:29:07,241 --> 00:29:09,327
I won't hurt you.

312
00:29:25,781 --> 00:29:28,235
You had nothing to do
with my sister's death.

313
00:29:28,674 --> 00:29:30,968
I'm not gonna do anything to you.

314
00:29:33,017 --> 00:29:34,602
How about Brian?

315
00:29:35,770 --> 00:29:37,647
What did Brian have to do with your sister?

316
00:29:38,272 --> 00:29:39,815
Seriously?

317
00:29:41,695 --> 00:29:45,508
Brian knew about what
his brother did to my sister.

318
00:29:46,947 --> 00:29:49,116
Did he report it to the police?

319
00:29:49,909 --> 00:29:51,160
He did not!

320
00:29:51,339 --> 00:29:54,217
He also tried to hide the truth.

321
00:29:55,859 --> 00:29:57,903
He kept it from you, didn't he?

322
00:29:58,695 --> 00:30:01,515
Did he tell you about me?

323
00:30:02,860 --> 00:30:04,429
He said nothing, didn't he?

324
00:30:05,007 --> 00:30:06,406
See?

325
00:30:07,385 --> 00:30:11,734
He's a Zuniga, and they're all the same.

326
00:30:15,008 --> 00:30:17,453
To protect themselves,

327
00:30:17,478 --> 00:30:21,515
they will use their money and power.

328
00:30:23,702 --> 00:30:25,164
And what about us?

329
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:29,532
You, me, my sister.

330
00:30:29,636 --> 00:30:31,638
Even your dad.

331
00:30:32,118 --> 00:30:34,286
We're nothing against them!

332
00:30:35,993 --> 00:30:37,539
What the fuck, Hannah?

333
00:30:39,625 --> 00:30:42,044
Do you honestly think that's
enough reason to do this?

334
00:30:43,087 --> 00:30:45,089
You murdered people.

335
00:30:46,382 --> 00:30:48,092
We're just like them.

336
00:30:48,492 --> 00:30:52,883
How about our families?
How about their families? Their children?

337
00:30:54,969 --> 00:30:56,679
Well, screw you too!

338
00:30:57,802 --> 00:31:01,723
Do you think I enjoyed this?

339
00:31:02,509 --> 00:31:05,414
Do you think I liked whoring myself out?

340
00:31:07,076 --> 00:31:09,078
Do you think I wanted to kill?

341
00:31:11,487 --> 00:31:14,823
I just want justice for my sister.

342
00:31:16,078 --> 00:31:17,455
That's all I wanted.

343
00:31:17,884 --> 00:31:21,578
But in every turn I
take, they block me.

344
00:31:25,478 --> 00:31:27,688
They made me do this.

345
00:31:28,937 --> 00:31:31,304
Whatever you say Hannah,

346
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,312
you're still a monster to me.

347
00:31:37,831 --> 00:31:39,625
So cut to the chase.

348
00:31:41,103 --> 00:31:43,117
What do you want from me?

349
00:31:48,743 --> 00:31:51,162
I want you to free me.

350
00:31:56,010 --> 00:31:58,429
I want to be with my sister.

351
00:31:58,454 --> 00:32:00,312
Free me, Gab.

352
00:32:01,248 --> 00:32:03,542
Free us all.

353
00:32:04,301 --> 00:32:07,211
We were both their victims, Hannah.

354
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:10,716
We're both holding a grudge.

355
00:32:13,093 --> 00:32:16,055
But I will never do what you did.

356
00:32:16,764 --> 00:32:18,724
Because if I do,

357
00:32:18,749 --> 00:32:20,843
that would mean I've already
given up on everything,

358
00:32:20,868 --> 00:32:23,406
that I'm just as much
of a coward as you are.

359
00:32:24,330 --> 00:32:26,624
I will always fight fair, Hannah.

360
00:32:26,649 --> 00:32:29,318
I will always do the right thing.

361
00:32:29,742 --> 00:32:31,786
I'm not like you.

362
00:32:32,613 --> 00:32:34,365
You lost your cause.

363
00:32:34,752 --> 00:32:38,506
And that's even worse

364
00:32:39,022 --> 00:32:41,357
than what they did to your sister.

365
00:32:51,357 --> 00:32:53,426
Take that back!

366
00:32:53,968 --> 00:32:57,388
I love my sister and she knows it.

367
00:32:58,305 --> 00:33:01,600
Do it Gab! Just kill me!

368
00:33:02,520 --> 00:33:04,897
Put an end to everything!

369
00:33:16,692 --> 00:33:18,986
I'm sorry Hannah.

370
00:33:21,707 --> 00:33:24,106
I can't give you what you want.
