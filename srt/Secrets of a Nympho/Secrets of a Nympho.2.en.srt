1
00:00:11,901 --> 00:00:15,238
Our latest true crime
story is still on-going.

2
00:00:17,017 --> 00:00:22,220
Once a year, they hold a barrister's
night at Potenciana University.

3
00:00:30,931 --> 00:00:36,110
Brian Zuniga, 19 years
old, sophomore student,

4
00:00:36,611 --> 00:00:37,862
Dead.

5
00:00:38,571 --> 00:00:40,615
Help us!

6
00:00:40,615 --> 00:00:43,785
It's Hannah! Help!

7
00:00:43,952 --> 00:00:45,370
Hannah what happened-

8
00:00:45,411 --> 00:00:46,746
Hannah!

9
00:00:46,913 --> 00:00:48,623
Hannah...

10
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,376
You're right!

11
00:00:51,376 --> 00:00:53,378
This looks like a suicide note!

12
00:00:54,613 --> 00:00:56,381
You might know anything about

13
00:00:56,381 --> 00:00:59,300
Brian and Hannah's fight
before the crime happened.

14
00:00:59,592 --> 00:01:01,094
It's Gab San Andres...

15
00:01:01,094 --> 00:01:03,096
It's that fucking San Andres.

16
00:01:03,096 --> 00:01:04,681
It's about Gab San Andres.

17
00:01:04,681 --> 00:01:07,600
You think Brian likes me?

18
00:01:08,184 --> 00:01:09,602
That's impossible.

19
00:01:09,769 --> 00:01:12,021
I don't think he’ll like me.

20
00:01:25,511 --> 00:01:27,370
I read in a meme,

21
00:01:27,745 --> 00:01:29,706
that living in guilt and regret

22
00:01:29,731 --> 00:01:32,041
is getting yourself trapped in the past.

23
00:01:32,996 --> 00:01:34,460
But the problem is,

24
00:01:34,961 --> 00:01:38,631
the only way to escape
it is by fixing the present,

25
00:01:38,656 --> 00:01:40,574
and facing what's in front of you

26
00:01:41,217 --> 00:01:42,844
however painful and

27
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:46,681
impossible it may seem.
Hey guys, listen.

28
00:01:46,806 --> 00:01:50,810
We should make a petition to
change the name of this hall.

29
00:01:50,835 --> 00:01:53,504
I mean, look at that!

30
00:01:53,896 --> 00:01:57,208
Potenciana shouldn't be associated

31
00:01:57,233 --> 00:02:01,696
with monsters like Brian Zuñiga. Right?

32
00:02:02,572 --> 00:02:06,492
Come on, what do you
think? Fill me in, whatever...

33
00:02:29,807 --> 00:02:31,434
Congressman Zuniga...

34
00:02:31,517 --> 00:02:33,061
this was the right move.

35
00:02:33,936 --> 00:02:37,565
You cannot carry this
scandal to your re-election.

36
00:02:38,107 --> 00:02:39,776
Not to mention,

37
00:02:40,193 --> 00:02:43,529
Zuniga Shipping stocks
have been affected too.

38
00:02:46,273 --> 00:02:49,077
But we're still talking about my brother.

39
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,120
Congressman...

40
00:02:51,746 --> 00:02:54,210
you didn't throw Brian under the bus.

41
00:02:55,041 --> 00:02:57,794
For now, we're just
working with what we have.

42
00:02:58,753 --> 00:03:00,713
All evidence points to him.

43
00:03:02,335 --> 00:03:03,483
Look...

44
00:03:04,008 --> 00:03:06,886
I understand all the logic behind this.

45
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:08,513
But this...

46
00:03:09,028 --> 00:03:12,022
this will definitely
break my father's heart.

47
00:03:15,244 --> 00:03:17,246
Based on the detectives' reports,

48
00:03:17,271 --> 00:03:19,916
Brian Zuniga's case has been ruled out

49
00:03:19,941 --> 00:03:23,695
as rape and attempted homicide,
in the court of San Lucas.

50
00:03:24,320 --> 00:03:27,448
Here is Congressman Zuniga's response.

51
00:03:27,488 --> 00:03:29,073
It may be difficult to accept,

52
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:32,453
but the whole Zuniga family,

53
00:03:32,620 --> 00:03:35,123
apologizes for everything

54
00:03:35,164 --> 00:03:38,084
my brother has done.

55
00:03:38,876 --> 00:03:42,046
We are on the process of communicating

56
00:03:42,588 --> 00:03:44,674
with the victim's family.

57
00:03:44,823 --> 00:03:45,852
Again...

58
00:03:47,390 --> 00:03:50,471
I ask for forgiveness.

59
00:03:51,273 --> 00:03:52,682
- Well, well!
- I hope...

60
00:03:52,807 --> 00:03:55,726
- Who's this Captain? Quite intriguing.
- that one day...

61
00:03:55,768 --> 00:03:57,270
Is he your boyfriend?

62
00:04:55,267 --> 00:04:57,269
- Chloe!
- Gab!

63
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,916
- Gab!
- Sorry, excuse me...

64
00:04:59,957 --> 00:05:02,435
- Hi! I'm glad you came.
- Hi!

65
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:05,463
- I couldn't sleep so...
- It's fine you're gonna have fun.

66
00:05:05,488 --> 00:05:08,065
Jiggy and our friends are here.

67
00:05:08,090 --> 00:05:10,927
- Huh?
- Jiggy's right there, I'll introduce you.

68
00:05:10,952 --> 00:05:12,695
No, it's fine! I'm good.

69
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:14,055
- What?
- I'm good, really.

70
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:16,458
No, you're not. So come on, let's party.

71
00:05:18,146 --> 00:05:19,564
Here.

72
00:05:19,936 --> 00:05:21,204
Let's go!

73
00:05:21,229 --> 00:05:23,981
- Hey! Woah!
- Guys, guys, guys!

74
00:05:24,106 --> 00:05:26,734
I'd like you to meet my best friend, Gab.

75
00:05:26,897 --> 00:05:29,733
Gab, that's Jiggy, my
boyfriend, you know him.

76
00:05:29,779 --> 00:05:32,782
That's Marion, Emerson,

77
00:05:32,807 --> 00:05:34,008
Molly...

78
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:36,452
Hannah at the back, and Brian.

79
00:05:36,702 --> 00:05:37,870
Hi, Gab.

80
00:05:44,043 --> 00:05:47,672
Everyone, back to the game?

81
00:05:47,964 --> 00:05:49,674
Back to the game!

82
00:05:49,699 --> 00:05:51,901
- I need to go the restroom.
- It's your turn.

83
00:05:51,926 --> 00:05:54,845
- Will you be okay?
- Yeah I'm okay.

84
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:53,362
Hi Gab!

85
00:06:53,735 --> 00:06:55,612
Hey...

86
00:07:07,912 --> 00:07:09,603
- What?
- Hmm?

87
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:11,464
I'm sorry, what?

88
00:07:11,559 --> 00:07:13,019
Huh?

89
00:07:13,044 --> 00:07:16,327
Oh, I thought you were saying something.

90
00:07:16,352 --> 00:07:18,929
No, I wasn't.

91
00:07:31,150 --> 00:07:32,943
So...Gab...I'll be over there.

92
00:07:33,084 --> 00:07:35,252
- Sure.
- It's Emerson.

93
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:37,865
Okay, Emerson.

94
00:07:46,224 --> 00:07:48,768
- Hey Gab...
- Hey!

95
00:07:48,793 --> 00:07:51,921
- You came back! Here I have some more.
- Maybe that's enough.

96
00:07:51,962 --> 00:07:54,173
- I'm good, I'm good.
- No, let's drink some more.

97
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:55,674
Hey, that's enough.

98
00:07:55,699 --> 00:07:57,943
That hit me hard, man.

99
00:07:57,968 --> 00:07:59,804
My head hurts.

100
00:08:13,234 --> 00:08:16,195
My head hurts so much.

101
00:08:21,384 --> 00:08:23,386
I only want Brian!

102
00:08:23,411 --> 00:08:27,873
And when I find out who stole him from me,

103
00:08:28,457 --> 00:08:31,419
I'll break her damn face!

104
00:08:55,985 --> 00:08:58,279
Gab! Oh my god!

105
00:08:58,362 --> 00:09:01,073
Why didn't you tell me you're into Emerson?

106
00:09:01,242 --> 00:09:03,411
I didn't know he was your type.

107
00:09:03,939 --> 00:09:05,733
What are you talking about?

108
00:09:06,976 --> 00:09:09,174
Don't play coy with me.

109
00:09:10,416 --> 00:09:12,585
Seriously, I have no
idea what you're saying.

110
00:09:13,919 --> 00:09:15,337
Really?

111
00:09:15,713 --> 00:09:16,714
What?

112
00:09:18,174 --> 00:09:19,592
This is what I'm talking about.

113
00:09:23,126 --> 00:09:24,628
Seriously, Chloe.

114
00:09:25,162 --> 00:09:27,456
Hannah sent it to everyone.

115
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:36,151
So tell me about Emerson...

116
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,206
Gab, don't take it seriously. It's a joke.

117
00:09:46,035 --> 00:09:47,912
What's your deal?

118
00:09:48,599 --> 00:09:50,977
Don't drag me into your shit.

119
00:09:51,510 --> 00:09:53,751
We're not fucking friends, bitch.

120
00:09:56,114 --> 00:09:57,948
Relax.

121
00:10:13,894 --> 00:10:16,081
- You have a problem with me?!
- Gab, what's going on?

122
00:10:16,106 --> 00:10:17,733
Gab, stop!

123
00:10:19,068 --> 00:10:20,277
Stop...

124
00:10:20,486 --> 00:10:22,183
let her go.

125
00:10:40,589 --> 00:10:42,341
Gab, what's wrong?

126
00:10:42,466 --> 00:10:45,928
The term just started and
you've already picked a fight?

127
00:10:46,554 --> 00:10:48,305
Why did you attack Hannah?

128
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:50,704
You're on scholarship, remember?

129
00:10:50,753 --> 00:10:53,714
This will not look good on your records.

130
00:10:54,855 --> 00:10:56,899
She took a video of me without my consent.

131
00:10:57,189 --> 00:10:59,066
And then she sent it to everybody.

132
00:10:59,852 --> 00:11:01,771
Why would she do that?

133
00:11:02,570 --> 00:11:03,737
First of all,

134
00:11:04,025 --> 00:11:05,995
what you did was indecent.

135
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:08,659
Second,

136
00:11:09,041 --> 00:11:12,461
if you're concerned about it, you
should've reported the video to the admin.

137
00:11:12,621 --> 00:11:16,125
You should not take matter
like this into your own hands.

138
00:11:17,084 --> 00:11:18,794
Are you serious?

139
00:11:19,587 --> 00:11:21,630
I'm the victim here!

140
00:11:22,256 --> 00:11:25,634
Are you sure you didn't provoke Hannah?

141
00:11:30,389 --> 00:11:33,809
Isn't she the one who's hurt
and in the clinic right now?

142
00:11:34,229 --> 00:11:36,554
The second she steps out of the clinic

143
00:11:36,579 --> 00:11:38,289
you better say sorry,

144
00:11:38,314 --> 00:11:40,608
or else I'll put this on your record

145
00:11:40,774 --> 00:11:43,694
and there's a possibility
you'd lose your scholarship.

146
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:02,773
Fuck you, Brian!

147
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:06,694
I saw Hannah kiss you in the library.

148
00:13:07,561 --> 00:13:09,188
- What?
- Seriously?

149
00:13:10,572 --> 00:13:12,324
I saw it!

150
00:13:17,913 --> 00:13:20,207
- I didn't want that to happen, Gab.
- Huh?

151
00:13:20,624 --> 00:13:23,210
You didn't want it? Liar!

152
00:13:23,794 --> 00:13:25,629
You kissed her back, didn't you!

153
00:13:25,796 --> 00:13:27,214
I had to do it.

154
00:13:27,589 --> 00:13:29,341
I had to make her believe.

155
00:13:29,466 --> 00:13:32,136
What do you mean? What are you saying?

156
00:13:32,428 --> 00:13:34,446
You want her to believe
that you love her too?

157
00:13:34,471 --> 00:13:36,265
The way you made me believe you?

158
00:13:37,349 --> 00:13:38,434
And for what?

159
00:13:38,726 --> 00:13:41,395
- So you can cheat on both of us!
- Please, Gab.

160
00:13:43,897 --> 00:13:45,899
I'm not even sleeping with her.

161
00:13:46,757 --> 00:13:48,592
I'm not cheating on you.

162
00:13:53,198 --> 00:13:55,951
She's hiding something from me
and I need to find out what it is.

163
00:13:58,536 --> 00:13:59,626
So please...

164
00:14:01,915 --> 00:14:04,042
What are you talking about?

165
00:14:09,763 --> 00:14:10,853
What?!

166
00:14:13,635 --> 00:14:16,013
Can you just trust me right now?

167
00:14:17,471 --> 00:14:19,307
Give me a week.

168
00:14:21,101 --> 00:14:22,311
A week?

169
00:14:23,437 --> 00:14:25,397
Why not now?

170
00:14:25,814 --> 00:14:29,318
Why can't you tell me now?! Do it now!

171
00:14:34,467 --> 00:14:37,451
A week. I can fix everything.

172
00:14:40,579 --> 00:14:42,247
We're done.

173
00:14:42,623 --> 00:14:45,292
- Gab...
- It's over.

174
00:14:46,930 --> 00:14:48,041
Gab...

175
00:14:48,796 --> 00:14:51,632
Gab!

176
00:16:46,955 --> 00:16:52,336
There's still a lot of unanswered
questions, my virgins and freaks.

177
00:16:53,921 --> 00:16:57,132
And you know I gave you the first scoop.

178
00:16:59,301 --> 00:17:02,374
I'll be the one to end it too.

179
00:17:04,765 --> 00:17:09,269
And wherever this investigation leads me,

180
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,856
I'll bring you along for the ride.

181
00:17:15,275 --> 00:17:17,027
As always...

182
00:17:17,653 --> 00:17:20,197
my eyes are open wide and I'm all ears...

183
00:17:20,989 --> 00:17:22,616
for you.

184
00:17:24,618 --> 00:17:26,370
Because I'm your girl...

185
00:17:27,591 --> 00:17:28,660
...V.

186
00:18:31,852 --> 00:18:33,812
They may have given up on you,

187
00:18:34,591 --> 00:18:36,384
but I haven't.

188
00:18:37,524 --> 00:18:39,656
I'll fight for you, Brian.

189
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:45,966
Everyone is yet to process the news about

190
00:18:45,991 --> 00:18:49,614
the closed rape, murder and suicide
case involving Brian and Hannah.

191
00:18:50,756 --> 00:18:54,009
- Why was the case closed immediately?
- So it's true!

192
00:18:54,374 --> 00:18:58,628
Why was it so easy for Brian's
family to accept what happened?

193
00:18:58,653 --> 00:19:02,741
Where's the DNA test?

194
00:19:04,079 --> 00:19:06,706
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

195
00:19:07,863 --> 00:19:09,823
Why couldn't they wait

196
00:19:09,848 --> 00:19:12,453
for Hannah Andal to wake
up before closing the case?

197
00:19:13,643 --> 00:19:16,563
Why did the investigators
never focus on Hannah?

198
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:20,391
Who is she, really?

199
00:19:21,281 --> 00:19:22,616
Where did she come from?

200
00:20:16,456 --> 00:20:17,707
Fuck!

201
00:20:21,461 --> 00:20:23,088
Dad!

202
00:20:24,005 --> 00:20:26,174
What are you doing here?

203
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:54,369
Dad please don't take
out your anger on my stuff.

204
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,497
You know I need those.

205
00:20:59,040 --> 00:21:00,876
How do you want me to feel about this?

206
00:21:01,543 --> 00:21:02,919
You're my child.

207
00:21:03,649 --> 00:21:06,068
And I know you bare
too much on that thing.

208
00:21:07,924 --> 00:21:11,386
Before you judge my podcast,

209
00:21:11,759 --> 00:21:15,054
maybe you'd like to
know more about it first?

210
00:21:15,470 --> 00:21:18,445
Because I do my research
before putting out anything.

211
00:21:19,070 --> 00:21:22,181
I do my work as a reporter
just like you taught me.

212
00:21:23,684 --> 00:21:25,227
If that's the case,

213
00:21:25,363 --> 00:21:27,281
then why do you have to show your body too?

214
00:21:30,238 --> 00:21:31,239
Dad...

215
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:34,492
that's how I get people to watch.

216
00:21:35,093 --> 00:21:36,678
That's the reason why

217
00:21:36,703 --> 00:21:40,248
they listen to what I have to say.

218
00:21:40,624 --> 00:21:44,127
And that's how I sustain my life.

219
00:21:46,755 --> 00:21:49,216
If you just accept what
I'm trying to send you,

220
00:21:50,015 --> 00:21:51,850
then you won't have to do this.

221
00:21:52,177 --> 00:21:55,096
I worked hard to earn my scholarship.

222
00:21:55,722 --> 00:21:57,098
I chose

223
00:21:57,182 --> 00:21:58,934
to attend Potenciana.

224
00:21:59,309 --> 00:22:01,895
It isn't your responsibility to take.

225
00:22:02,588 --> 00:22:03,714
Besides...

226
00:22:04,231 --> 00:22:07,609
Dad, I know things are
complicated for you too...

227
00:22:08,151 --> 00:22:11,196
Especially without a regular job.

228
00:22:12,489 --> 00:22:14,074
You don't have to worry about me.

229
00:22:14,783 --> 00:22:16,952
I can take care of myself.

230
00:22:17,494 --> 00:22:19,412
Same goes for me, dad.

231
00:22:20,372 --> 00:22:22,374
I can take care of myself too.

232
00:22:23,583 --> 00:22:25,502
So don't worry about me.

233
00:22:25,794 --> 00:22:28,755
And dad I swear, I'm
not crossing any lines.

234
00:22:29,839 --> 00:22:31,758
That's exactly the problem.

235
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,344
You're almost there.

236
00:22:36,846 --> 00:22:39,599
Don’t cross the Zunigas.

237
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,518
They make a dangerous enemy.

238
00:22:44,604 --> 00:22:45,939
I know Brian.

239
00:22:47,974 --> 00:22:52,019
I'm sure he isn't capable of doing
those things they accuse him of.

240
00:22:52,862 --> 00:22:57,492
I do this because I need to find
out the truth about him and Hannah.

241
00:23:00,120 --> 00:23:01,371
The truth?

242
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:04,124
Leave the job to the detectives.

243
00:23:04,374 --> 00:23:05,959
That's their responsibility.

244
00:23:07,294 --> 00:23:12,382
The truth won't feed you.
But the lies won't make me sleep.

245
00:23:13,591 --> 00:23:15,510
Listen to me.

246
00:23:15,844 --> 00:23:18,138
What you may think is true,

247
00:23:18,346 --> 00:23:19,472
isn't always the truth.

248
00:23:20,515 --> 00:23:22,309
Sometimes it's just a trap,

249
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:25,061
meant to sink you deeper into a pit.

250
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,897
And you don't think I'd survive?

251
00:23:29,357 --> 00:23:31,276
I've heard this before, dad.

252
00:23:31,735 --> 00:23:34,029
You've told me this a million times.

253
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:36,364
But you can't change my mind.

254
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,494
I don't care about what
you'd like to believe.

255
00:23:43,079 --> 00:23:44,956
This isn't a democracy.

256
00:23:47,083 --> 00:23:49,044
Stop doing the podcast.

257
00:23:49,627 --> 00:23:50,962
Or else...

258
00:23:51,087 --> 00:23:53,882
I'll drag you out of Potenciana myself.

259
00:23:55,091 --> 00:23:56,968
I've seen this so many times.

260
00:23:58,887 --> 00:24:03,141
One day you'll wake up
not knowing who you are.

261
00:24:16,029 --> 00:24:17,405
Come on, babe.

262
00:24:18,573 --> 00:24:19,657
Babe, please?

263
00:24:21,451 --> 00:24:23,328
Babe I need this!

264
00:24:23,536 --> 00:24:25,789
Wait a minute, just hold on.

265
00:24:26,122 --> 00:24:29,250
Do we have to do this now?
Are we really doing it here?

266
00:24:29,466 --> 00:24:33,720
- Can't we do it after school?
- There's nobody here.

267
00:24:34,214 --> 00:24:35,632
Please, please, please?

268
00:24:37,146 --> 00:24:38,843
Please.

269
00:24:56,403 --> 00:24:57,529
Please.

270
00:24:57,695 --> 00:25:01,491
- Why here? Not here!
- There's nobody around! Please?

271
00:25:01,491 --> 00:25:03,785
Somebody might see us!

272
00:25:45,990 --> 00:25:47,121
Captain?

273
00:25:47,495 --> 00:25:49,831
- Coach! Oh shit...fuck.
- Coach!

274
00:25:51,641 --> 00:25:53,935
- Ms. Angeles!
- Sorry coach, sorry sorry!

275
00:25:53,960 --> 00:25:55,837
- Please join the mass.
- Yes, coach!

276
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,170
I need a moment with my team captain.

277
00:26:00,737 --> 00:26:02,948
Please join us later guys.

278
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:08,074
- Let's all pray for Hannah's recovery.
- Please help us.

279
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,976
Thank you!

280
00:26:17,025 --> 00:26:19,736
Hi! Let's all pray for Hannah.

281
00:26:31,331 --> 00:26:33,875
Hannah's so lucky to have you.

282
00:26:34,334 --> 00:26:36,586
You still care for her until now.

283
00:26:38,421 --> 00:26:43,551
Are her parents and
family joining the mass?

284
00:26:44,052 --> 00:26:47,263
Well, that’s what best friends are for.

285
00:26:47,263 --> 00:26:48,515
And please,

286
00:26:48,765 --> 00:26:50,683
don't act like you care for Hannah.

287
00:26:50,993 --> 00:26:53,203
We know you hate her.

288
00:26:53,578 --> 00:26:56,789
Yeah...and we may not have caught you yet

289
00:26:56,814 --> 00:26:58,900
but Hannah was sure

290
00:26:59,523 --> 00:27:01,858
that you were trying to steal

291
00:27:02,176 --> 00:27:04,011
Brian from her.

292
00:27:06,741 --> 00:27:08,117
There it is.

293
00:27:08,535 --> 00:27:10,411
I knew it.

294
00:27:11,412 --> 00:27:14,290
You were the one who
told the police lies about me.

295
00:27:16,125 --> 00:27:18,461
Well I'm still here!

296
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:21,806
And I wasn't arrested.

297
00:27:22,465 --> 00:27:25,009
Because all you have are gossips.

298
00:27:25,885 --> 00:27:28,596
Anyway, I don't have time for this.

299
00:27:29,338 --> 00:27:31,340
Let's just pray for Hannah,

300
00:27:31,365 --> 00:27:32,992
and hope she wakes up soon,

301
00:27:33,164 --> 00:27:35,041
to tell everyone the truth.

302
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:56,541
Who are you?!

303
00:27:58,251 --> 00:28:01,087
Code! Code! Doc!

304
00:28:03,753 --> 00:28:07,131
What happened to you?

305
00:28:07,927 --> 00:28:12,015
Fuck this, Gab! Coach caught
Jiggy and me in the locker room.

306
00:28:12,599 --> 00:28:13,725
What?

307
00:28:14,183 --> 00:28:15,977
What's wrong with Jiggy?

308
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:19,063
Didn't he realize you
could lose your scholarship?

309
00:28:19,188 --> 00:28:21,858
He didn't want it, I did.

310
00:28:25,486 --> 00:28:28,114
I just want things to go
back the way they were.

311
00:28:30,325 --> 00:28:33,119
After the incident with Brian and Hannah...

312
00:28:33,703 --> 00:28:36,497
I just felt him drifting away.

313
00:28:37,498 --> 00:28:40,501
Gab, I think there's
something he isn't telling me...

314
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:44,172
like he's hiding something.

315
00:28:48,134 --> 00:28:50,053
I just don't want us to break up.

316
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:54,557
But now I think I might
have cost him the team.

317
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,729
Chloe, don't panic yet, okay?

318
00:29:00,450 --> 00:29:02,248
If coach is as pissed as you think he is,

319
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:05,604
then both of you should've been called
to the principal's office by now, right?

320
00:29:05,956 --> 00:29:08,750
So let's just wait til we
know what they talked about.

321
00:29:12,598 --> 00:29:13,682
Do I look okay?

322
00:29:13,868 --> 00:29:15,411
Forgiveness is a gift

323
00:29:15,453 --> 00:29:16,788
and never deserved.

324
00:29:17,872 --> 00:29:19,207
Forgiveness for our sins

325
00:29:19,232 --> 00:29:21,943
from God is not deserved.

326
00:29:22,375 --> 00:29:23,752
For most of us,

327
00:29:24,061 --> 00:29:25,938
what Brian Zuniga has done

328
00:29:26,196 --> 00:29:28,115
is maybe unforgivable.

329
00:29:28,440 --> 00:29:29,942
But just like God...

330
00:29:30,067 --> 00:29:31,778
We must impart the gift

331
00:29:31,803 --> 00:29:33,721
of forgiveness upon him.

332
00:29:34,013 --> 00:29:35,306
Otherwise...

333
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:38,590
we are left with nothing
but hate and resentment

334
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,155
which is like taking poison.

335
00:29:41,722 --> 00:29:43,640
We make ourselves miserable,

336
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,301
and angry,

337
00:29:45,326 --> 00:29:48,079
and we sometimes hold
a grudge for a lifetime.

338
00:29:49,502 --> 00:29:50,920
Are you crying?

339
00:29:52,845 --> 00:29:54,221
No.

340
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,277
- Are you sure?
- I guess I just felt that.

341
00:29:57,302 --> 00:29:58,570
Really?

342
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:05,754
And now to give us some messages
for their good friend Hannah,

343
00:30:05,779 --> 00:30:07,864
here are Sam and Molly.

344
00:30:14,307 --> 00:30:15,880
Good morning, everyone.

345
00:30:15,905 --> 00:30:18,700
For those who don't know us,

346
00:30:19,168 --> 00:30:22,255
I am Sam, and this is my friend, Molly.

347
00:30:23,725 --> 00:30:26,353
We are Hannah's best friends.

348
00:30:27,432 --> 00:30:29,475
And our today's prayer

349
00:30:29,500 --> 00:30:34,147
together with the rest of you,
is for our friend's speedy recovery.

350
00:30:37,398 --> 00:30:38,668
Hannah,

351
00:30:38,693 --> 00:30:41,237
is one of the best people I've met.

352
00:30:41,696 --> 00:30:44,115
She's a very helpful person,

353
00:30:44,407 --> 00:30:46,451
and generous at that.

354
00:30:47,201 --> 00:30:49,162
Just ask her,

355
00:30:49,329 --> 00:30:52,832
and you will receive whatever you need.

356
00:30:54,042 --> 00:30:55,752
That's true.

357
00:30:56,294 --> 00:31:00,715
Her door was always open to anyone.

358
00:31:02,110 --> 00:31:03,968
Just knock,

359
00:31:04,594 --> 00:31:06,721
and she'll let you in.

360
00:31:15,063 --> 00:31:17,148
Why are they laughing?

361
00:31:29,118 --> 00:31:33,081
Thank you, thank you, everyone!
Don't forget to tag us!

363
00:31:39,003 --> 00:31:41,047
Girl, you were so great earlier.

364
00:31:53,518 --> 00:31:55,770
You think they got the joke?

365
00:31:56,479 --> 00:31:59,148
About the door?

366
00:31:59,816 --> 00:32:01,234
That was careless of you.

367
00:32:01,943 --> 00:32:04,737
She never confirmed it with us, you know.

368
00:32:05,071 --> 00:32:07,991
I saw some of them laughing.

369
00:32:08,324 --> 00:32:12,203
Maybe...they know about
Hannah's secret condo.

370
00:32:12,402 --> 00:32:13,788
It looks to me like...

371
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,667
she's had a lot of customers there.

372
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:25,633
Hello virgins, and freaks.

373
00:32:25,658 --> 00:32:27,803
I know a lot of you are waiting for the

374
00:32:27,803 --> 00:32:30,747
latest tea from Potenciana's
murder-rape case.

375
00:32:32,056 --> 00:32:36,352
So we know our ever demure
and virgin Hannah Andal...

376
00:32:36,790 --> 00:32:37,870
well...

377
00:32:37,895 --> 00:32:39,856
and this is according to my source,

378
00:32:39,881 --> 00:32:44,474
lives a secret life in a secret condo...

379
00:32:44,842 --> 00:32:46,594
with a secret door...

380
00:32:46,865 --> 00:32:49,544
and a secret knock.

381
00:32:50,113 --> 00:32:52,074
Simply knock on her door,

382
00:32:52,333 --> 00:32:55,386
and she'll knock you out.

383
00:33:40,792 --> 00:33:46,923
It seems like Hannah was
involved in not just one guy...

384
00:33:46,948 --> 00:33:48,508
not just two...

385
00:33:48,633 --> 00:33:50,426
and who knows?

386
00:33:50,533 --> 00:33:53,661
Maybe not just three.

387
00:33:53,830 --> 00:33:55,415
What does this mean?

388
00:33:55,723 --> 00:33:57,016
I don't know...

389
00:33:57,178 --> 00:34:01,766
All I can say is if Hannah
is involved with multiple men...

390
00:34:02,436 --> 00:34:06,206
well, these are all possible suspects

391
00:34:06,231 --> 00:34:09,278
that our police haven't talked to.

392
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:13,825
So what do you think my virgins and freaks?

393
00:34:14,132 --> 00:34:16,092
If the knockers are real,

394
00:34:16,128 --> 00:34:17,922
then who are they?

395
00:34:18,569 --> 00:34:20,154
Your...

396
00:34:20,179 --> 00:34:23,265
class president? Your editor-in-chief?

397
00:34:23,290 --> 00:34:25,591
Your student assistant? Or maybe...

398
00:34:25,903 --> 00:34:27,786
your star varsity!

399
00:34:30,049 --> 00:34:31,175
Who knows?

400
00:34:31,817 --> 00:34:33,945
Take care, my loves...

401
00:34:33,970 --> 00:34:35,096
You never know...

402
00:34:35,348 --> 00:34:38,392
anyone could be that guy...or guys!

403
00:34:40,340 --> 00:34:43,468
So if you see or hear anything,

404
00:34:43,526 --> 00:34:45,695
or...feel...

405
00:34:46,899 --> 00:34:49,735
just drop me a message, and let's talk.

406
00:34:49,760 --> 00:34:52,220
-  Wait babe, I'm listening to V.
- Goodnight, I love you all.

407
00:34:52,245 --> 00:34:55,581
Just turn it off, damn it!
I wanna know what's happening!

408
00:34:55,606 --> 00:34:57,635
- What are you doing?
- I told you

409
00:34:57,660 --> 00:35:00,580
- turn this shit off!
- Why are you so cross?

410
00:35:00,989 --> 00:35:03,099
- You're so annoying!
- What's wrong with you?

411
00:35:03,124 --> 00:35:04,817
There you go! Phone's all yours!

412
00:35:04,842 --> 00:35:06,594
You're pissing me off!

413
00:35:11,527 --> 00:35:13,402
Do you really want me to leave you?

414
00:35:15,178 --> 00:35:16,846
Get in the car!

415
00:35:17,597 --> 00:35:19,223
Now!

416
00:35:27,773 --> 00:35:29,775
What's this about, Ms. Arceo?

417
00:35:30,167 --> 00:35:32,920
Did i get another demerit?
This is making me nervous.

418
00:35:32,945 --> 00:35:34,363
Have a seat.

419
00:35:40,036 --> 00:35:41,746
This is about Hannah.

420
00:35:42,233 --> 00:35:45,027
I know that you guys are not in good terms.

421
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:49,670
I remember your fight
about her video prank.

422
00:35:51,339 --> 00:35:52,715
That was a long time ago.

423
00:35:53,090 --> 00:35:54,217
I know...

424
00:35:54,467 --> 00:35:56,260
but I want you to know

425
00:35:56,510 --> 00:35:59,055
that Hannah felt guilty about what she did.

426
00:36:01,974 --> 00:36:04,143
How did you know that?

427
00:36:04,810 --> 00:36:06,520
She talked to me.

428
00:36:07,063 --> 00:36:09,815
Her conscience wouldn't
leave her alone for days.

429
00:36:10,107 --> 00:36:12,652
And Hannah isn't someone
who's used to quarrels.

430
00:36:13,069 --> 00:36:17,031
She pulled the prank because
she wanted to be close to you.

431
00:36:18,616 --> 00:36:20,618
I guess she's just a liar, ma'am.

432
00:36:21,535 --> 00:36:24,288
She probably did that to get to you first.

433
00:36:24,956 --> 00:36:28,042
Because if I reported the
incident first, she'd be in trouble.

434
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:31,504
I don't think so...

435
00:36:31,754 --> 00:36:33,422
She seemed sincere.

436
00:36:33,756 --> 00:36:35,466
And besides,

437
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:38,386
she's fighting for her life right now.

438
00:36:38,719 --> 00:36:41,806
How do you think she'd
be able to get back at you?

439
00:36:44,934 --> 00:36:46,644
I don't know, but...

440
00:36:48,271 --> 00:36:51,857
based on how she treats me,
I don't think she's guilty at all.

441
00:36:53,943 --> 00:36:56,737
Have you heard of V's podcast?

442
00:36:59,657 --> 00:37:00,950
I have.

443
00:37:02,410 --> 00:37:07,623
She said in her podcast
about having a reliable source.

444
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:10,209
I just want to know...

445
00:37:11,085 --> 00:37:12,712
is it you?

446
00:37:15,298 --> 00:37:19,051
Me? No, I'm not. I don't
know anything about V.

447
00:37:22,179 --> 00:37:25,891
You're the only person I know
who has a grudge against Hannah.

448
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:31,564
Ms. Arceo, if I am holding
a grudge against Hannah,

449
00:37:32,231 --> 00:37:34,817
then I should have
reported her to you earlier.

450
00:37:35,067 --> 00:37:36,819
But I didn't.

451
00:37:42,491 --> 00:37:47,204
Sorry if I might have accused you.
You may go.

452
00:37:48,134 --> 00:37:49,582
Alright.

453
00:37:59,633 --> 00:38:00,718
Gab!

454
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:05,239
Jiggy just broke up with me!

455
00:38:05,264 --> 00:38:08,601
What? Why did he break up with you?

456
00:38:08,918 --> 00:38:11,087
Was it because coach caught you two?

457
00:38:11,437 --> 00:38:13,189
Was he kicked out of the team?

458
00:38:13,522 --> 00:38:16,317
No...I don't get it actually...

459
00:38:16,788 --> 00:38:19,249
Because coach gave him another chance.

460
00:38:19,522 --> 00:38:22,483
We were okay. We even went out on a date.

461
00:38:24,575 --> 00:38:25,868
But then...

462
00:38:25,993 --> 00:38:28,871
when he heard about V's podcast...

463
00:38:29,789 --> 00:38:30,915
he just...

464
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:34,725
he lost it and broke it off with me.

465
00:38:37,296 --> 00:38:39,673
Why would he be mad at...

466
00:38:40,091 --> 00:38:41,550
V's podcast?

467
00:38:43,677 --> 00:38:46,138
Do you think he knows something
about Hannah and Brian?

468
00:38:46,806 --> 00:38:49,308
No, I don't think so.

469
00:38:49,558 --> 00:38:51,560
I love Jiggy and...

470
00:38:51,644 --> 00:38:54,772
it's impossible that
he's involved. I doubt it.

471
00:38:55,272 --> 00:38:58,567
Chloe, I get you, okay?

472
00:38:58,651 --> 00:39:00,277
But the thing is

473
00:39:00,528 --> 00:39:03,989
your feelings for Jiggy may
be clouding your judgment.

474
00:39:04,990 --> 00:39:07,076
What if he's hiding
something from you?

475
00:39:08,661 --> 00:39:12,331
Think about it, why would he
react that way about the podcast?

476
00:39:19,338 --> 00:39:22,675
Remember that night I
told you we got separated?

477
00:39:23,592 --> 00:39:27,054
I remember him coming
from the main building.

478
00:39:32,518 --> 00:39:33,811
Gab...

479
00:39:34,562 --> 00:39:36,897
I know what you're thinking, but...

480
00:39:37,064 --> 00:39:38,941
I just think it's impossible because

481
00:39:39,817 --> 00:39:43,404
the roof deck was too far away
and he came for me immediately.

482
00:39:44,530 --> 00:39:45,781
Please.

483
00:39:47,366 --> 00:39:48,868
Please...

484
00:39:49,034 --> 00:39:52,413
I don't know what to think anymore, Chloe.

485
00:39:55,666 --> 00:39:58,085
But as long as we're not sure,

486
00:39:59,295 --> 00:40:01,922
can you stay away from
Jiggy in the meantime?

487
00:40:02,965 --> 00:40:04,967
He might be dangerous, Chloe.

488
00:40:14,768 --> 00:40:17,855
Alright, alright. I'm on my way to the car.

489
00:40:18,022 --> 00:40:19,940
Hold on, go ahead.

490
00:40:20,191 --> 00:40:22,943
I'm here. Let me handle this, I got it.

491
00:40:24,320 --> 00:40:25,404
Okay, okay.

492
00:40:26,197 --> 00:40:28,282
Alright. Okay, bye.

493
00:40:35,456 --> 00:40:37,958
Hey! Fuck!

494
00:40:38,542 --> 00:40:39,960
I'm in a hurry.

495
00:42:07,590 --> 00:42:10,634
I can't believe Jiggy's a murderer.

496
00:42:11,135 --> 00:42:14,930
Like, how did I fall for a
murderer and a rapist?

497
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:19,143
Just leave him, Chloe. Stay away from him.

498
00:42:20,603 --> 00:42:21,770
Hey!!!

499
00:42:27,568 --> 00:42:29,278
Enough! Fuck this!

500
00:42:34,491 --> 00:42:35,743
Is it true?

501
00:42:36,410 --> 00:42:39,538
Is V telling the truth about you?
