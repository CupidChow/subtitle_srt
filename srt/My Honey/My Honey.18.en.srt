Are you done talking?

Ningyu,

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,200
I'm grateful

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:12,120
for your help when I needed money most.

7
00:00:12,560 --> 00:00:14,520
But now I'm more convinced

8
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:16,920
that Ye Juncheng will be the champion
of the Oil Painting Competition.

Are you finished?

12
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:28,240
Just a few more moments.

13
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:30,600
I'm really suffering.

14
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:33,480
I'll pay you 8.8 yuan, the market price.

15
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:35,560
Let me have a look first.

16
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,760
Su Ziying, what have you painted?

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,600
I didn't mean to paint, actually.

18
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:47,080
I just wanted you to feel

19
00:00:47,080 --> 00:00:48,320
how a model would feel.

20
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:50,920
So, think about what you'll paint.

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:53,000
I bragged already.

22
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:54,840
Here's your schedule.

23
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,480
From two to five in the afternoon,

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:57,760
you'll observe life.

25
00:00:57,760 --> 00:00:59,160
(Eye exercises, breakfast,
reading (at least 10 pages))

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:00,610
(Textbook preview, oral practice,
running (jogging))

27
00:01:00,610 --> 00:01:01,890
(Homework, lunch,
kitchen cleaning (It must be tidy.))

(Sunbathing, painting,
life observing, dinner)

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:14,840
I watched the interviews
of many famous oil painters.

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,200
They said that inspiration usually
came from minutiae of life.

31
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,400
I asked you to observe life.

32
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:27,640
Why are you staring at me?

33
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:29,720
You're my model.

34
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:31,800
My life and inspiration

35
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:33,160
come from observing you.

36
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:36,240
Don't be glib-tongued.

37
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:38,930
Su Ziying,

38
00:01:39,800 --> 00:01:40,720
speaking of that,

39
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:42,920
why are you so confident in me?

40
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:45,360
Because you're weird.

41
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:47,920
Artists are weirdos.

42
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,360
Say something nice, okay?

43
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:54,920
You...

44
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:56,000
You're the painter

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:01:59,160
I have confidence in.

46
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:01,440
You must be good.

47
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:03,880
Don't be glib-tongued.

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,040
Do you have inspiration?

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:08,880
What will you paint for the competition?

50
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:11,360
Not yet.

51
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:20,120
Stop painting.

52
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,360
Hello, students and teachers.

53
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:38,160
After rounds of fierce competition,

54
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:39,520
in the end,

55
00:02:39,520 --> 00:02:41,480
two oil paintings

56
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:43,040
will compete for the final Gold Award.

57
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:44,400

Girl Playing Pipa from Bai Ningyu

59

and Legend of Star and Moon

61
00:02:57,400 --> 00:02:58,640
from Ye Juncheng

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:02:59,880
of Qingyuan Art College.

63

(This is the moment)

(he's everywhere.)

(Without him,)

(would never be in chaos.)

70
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,960
Through consistent comments
from the judges,

71
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:45,600
the champion goes to...

72
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:50,920
Girl Playing Pipa from Bai Ningyu

73
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:53,480
of Zhongyang Academy of Art.

74
00:03:53,480 --> 00:03:54,440
Give him a big hand.

75
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,720
Well, let's have our champion

76
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,280
give his acceptance speech.

77
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,840
I knew

78
00:04:09,320 --> 00:04:10,240
I would be the champion.

79
00:04:11,240 --> 00:04:12,800
I'm very satisfied

80
00:04:14,600 --> 00:04:15,760
with the judges' decision.

81
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:20,400
In painting, diligent practice
isn't enough.

82
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:22,400
Talent is

83
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:23,520
more important.

84
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,440
Besides,

85
00:04:26,440 --> 00:04:28,480
Ye Juncheng's painting is good, too.

86
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:31,080
He just used too many skills,

87
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:33,200
instead of feelings.

88
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:34,840
Sir,

89
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:36,790
I have a different opinion.

90
00:04:38,920 --> 00:04:39,520
Sorry,

91
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:41,040
girl.

92
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,200
This is a professional
oil painting competition

93
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,520
and we don't need public judges.

94
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:48,140
Paintings should
be enjoyed by the public.

95
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:49,280
Besides,

96
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,720
I'm the model for these two paintings.

97
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:53,560
Why can't I give an opinion?

98
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,880
Well, Miss Model,

99
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,080
what suggestions do you have?

100
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,560
I think Ye Juncheng's painting is better,

101
00:05:02,680 --> 00:05:04,240
especially in the expression of emotions.

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:06,280
As the model,

103
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,000
in his painting,

104
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,040
I've felt unprecedented
expressiveness and vitality.

105
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:15,040
In terms of either painting or character,

106
00:05:16,360 --> 00:05:16,920
I think...

107
00:05:16,920 --> 00:05:18,400
Miss Model, you'd better shut up.

108
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:20,840
You're the one who should shut up.

109
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:22,760
Let her finish.

110
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:34,740
(I can lose everything
of the world but you.)

111
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:37,160
I think Ye Juncheng's painting is better,

112
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,680
especially in the expression of emotions.

113
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,560
As the model,

114
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,200
in his painting, I've felt...

115
00:05:43,200 --> 00:05:44,200
What are you looking at?

116
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:45,280
Leave!

117
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:46,280
Why are you still sitting here?

118
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:50,600
How could he be so happy after losing?

119
