00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:06,600
Hurry. Hurry.

4
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:10,520
I could have done more exercise.

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:13,440
Su Ziying, have a collective sense
of honor, will you?

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:14,880
Fine, fine.

7
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,400
You don't exactly come
for the ball game, do you?

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,080
Qingyuan, Qingyuan, forward, forward!

9
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:24,680
Qingyuan, Qingyuan,

10
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,040
forward, forward!

14
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:40,960
Lin Han told me

15
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:43,480
that Ye Juncheng never attended
such a game before.

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:46,760
He's doing this just for you.

17
00:00:46,760 --> 00:00:48,720
I never mind who he cares about.

18
00:00:49,240 --> 00:00:50,600
Lin Han also said

19
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:53,640
that Ye Juncheng made everything
clear to Hua Yun.

20
00:00:53,880 --> 00:00:56,040
But she still clung to him.

21
00:00:57,320 --> 00:00:57,760
Su Ziying.

22
00:01:02,040 --> 00:01:02,480
Su Ziying,

23
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:03,960
let me explain.

24
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:05,600
It's not what you think it is.

25
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:08,320
Bai Ningyu. Bai Ningyu.

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:22,040
Ningyu.

27
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:49,320
Why did you stare at him?

28
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:50,840
Are you acquainted with him?

29
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:52,160
He's Ningyu.

30
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,800
I served as his model.

31
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,120
Why must I explain so much to you?

32
00:01:56,120 --> 00:01:57,200
It's none of your business.

33
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,080
Su Ziying,

34
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:00,080
you served as somebody else's model?

35
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:02,440
What's the problem?

36
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:05,400
Fine. Whatever.

37
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:06,160
I don't care, anyway.

38
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,320
Juncheng, do your best.

39
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:09,680
I'll always support you.

40
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:13,510
Here.

41
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:15,540
Have some water before the game.

42
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:22,240
What?

43
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:23,760
Su Ziying,

44
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,600
you're still employed by me.

45
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,880
I order you to open it for me.

46
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:32,840
Why can't you do it by yourself?

47
00:02:35,960 --> 00:02:38,280
I'll save my strength
to defeat Bai Ningyu.

48
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:16,960
Juncheng, Juncheng, you'll succeed.

49
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,480
Ningyu, Ningyu, go and win.

50
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:24,200
Ye Juncheng,

51
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:25,000
go back on defense.

52
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,178
Su Ziying, don't ruin
the collective honor

53
00:03:28,202 --> 00:03:30,200
for your personal feelings.

54
00:03:36,960 --> 00:03:38,280
In either basketball or painting,

55
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,640
you'll be defeated by me.

56
00:03:40,240 --> 00:03:41,840
And for this oil painting competition,

57
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,320
I plan to use Su Ziying as my model, too.

58
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:45,160
You!

59
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,120
Qingyuan, Qingyuan, forward, forward!

60
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:01,840
You'll always score!

61
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:17,280
It's a goal!

62
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:18,680
Yeah!

63
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:19,400
Wow.
