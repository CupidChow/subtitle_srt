How about you put on that dress?

00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:30,160
I believe it conforms better
to oil painting aesthetics.

I'll complain about you!

Ziying, are you all right?

5
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,600
Su Ziying?

00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:49,040
Why is it you again?

Is there a kind of person...?

00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:53,120
Leave.

9
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:54,440
Leave immediately.

10
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:56,640

and thoughtful...

Are you sure?

15
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:05,080
Then he must be
having a split personality.

I have to

17

tell you something today.

18

that you can't wait to see me?

Not at all.

28
00:01:44,160 --> 00:01:45,200
Su Ziying is gone.

29
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:46,920
Did she have so much fun last night

30

that she stayed in Ye Juncheng's home?

She...

32
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:51,920
What kind of girl
do you think Ziying is?

33
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:53,920
She never stays out all night.

34
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:55,240
She isn't like you.

35
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:56,920
Come on, when you talk about her,

don't insult me.

I'm really anxious.

I can't get through to her.

39
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:01,200
Ah?

40
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:01,680
Go, go, go.

Let's go check if she's home.

Ziying,

43
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:44,460
I'm back.

44
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:46,040
Are you hungry?

45
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,600
I've brought you something to eat.

Ziying,

47

did I scare you?

48
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:56,760
I fell in love with you at first sight.

49
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:58,760
I'm the one who pursued you.

50

You're scared of me?

51
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,360
Stay away.

What's so great about him?

I'm gentler than him,

more considerate than him,

55
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:10,520
and I love you more than he does.

56
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:12,480
This isn't love!

57
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:13,840
Then what is love?
