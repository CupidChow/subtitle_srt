Shame on her.)

00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:12,960
That's her. That's her.

5
00:00:13,220 --> 00:00:14,720
(She doesn't appear to be so shameless.)
I really didn't know she was shameless.

6
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,000
That's her.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,680
Excuse me.

8
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:27,680
What on earth are you talking about?

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,320
You don't know what you did?

10
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:31,520
Clarify it.

11
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:33,440
Oops.

12
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,640
Why did your lunch fall by itself?

13
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:36,560
Oh, no.

14
00:00:36,560 --> 00:00:37,360
Are you nuts?

15
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:37,920
Oh my God.

16
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:39,560
Dear me.

17
00:00:39,560 --> 00:00:40,000
You...

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:41,040
Clarify it.

19
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:41,600
Don't bother to go after them.

20
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:42,880
I know what they talked about.

What?

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,120
Su Ziying hooked up with a rich boy?

25
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:55,040
Shh.

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,000
Keep your voice down,

27
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:57,120
or the whole school would hear you.

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,360
Come on.

29
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:00,800
How could Su Ziying
hook up with a rich guy?

30
00:01:03,240 --> 00:01:04,000
I mean...

31
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:06,560
Why did she do that?

32
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,920
That guy even made a PPT
to cook up the story.

33
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:10,000
That's strange.

34
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:11,600
Not exactly.

35
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,000
Even an errant man likes
to apologize with a PPT.

(White Paper for How a Material Girl
Seduced a Rich Boy)

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,480
Also, this guy used "seduced",

38
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:18,680
instead of "hooked up".

39
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:23,800
Don't worry.

40
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:25,560
I'll check out who made this PPT.

41
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,440
Right.

42
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:27,280
Let's find him

43
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:28,820
and screw him.

44
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:31,040
Some information is true.

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:32,480
After all,

46
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:35,680
Ye Juncheng and I
have some money trading.

47
00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:41,080
Ziying,

48
00:01:41,080 --> 00:01:42,080
where are you going?

49
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,220
To work.

50
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:44,240
I won't stop working

51
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:45,460
unless I die.

52
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,120
Come on.

53
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:52,880
Why is she so unmindful?

54
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,360
Whoever started the trouble must end it.

55
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:00,320
I'll ask Ye Juncheng
to solve the problem.

56
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,960
When did you friend him on WeChat?

57
00:02:09,680 --> 00:02:10,640
Are you acquainted with him?

58
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:14,590
This isn't the point, okay?

59
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:32,440
Hello, Miss.

60
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,120
What would you like?

61
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,120
You don't look very beautiful.

62
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:40,200
Who are you looking for?

63
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:42,720
Where's Ye Juncheng?

64
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:44,680
Aren't you together?

65
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:46,760
Ye Juncheng isn't here.

66
00:02:47,320 --> 00:02:48,000
If you want to talk to him...

67
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:48,800
I want to talk to you.

68
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:55,040
Let's talk somewhere else.

69
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:06,480
What do you think?

70
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,400
Do you like the PowerPoint
I made for you?

71
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:12,280
So, it's you.

72
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,320
Mm.

73
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:15,280
I forgot to introduce myself.

74
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:16,880
I'm Hua Yun.

75
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,960
I study business abroad.

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,760
I am

77
00:03:22,320 --> 00:03:23,120
Ye Juncheng's fiancée.

78
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:28,080
I grew up with him.

79
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,600
We're typical childhood sweethearts.

80
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:32,520
We're family friends, too.

81
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,200
I study business abroad

82
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,760
just to help Ye Juncheng
with his business later.

83
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:41,640
A poor student like you
can't be as good as me.

84
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:44,080
Besides,

85
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:47,480
a humble girl like you
wants to marry such a rich guy?

86
00:03:48,040 --> 00:03:49,640
That's not going to happen.

87
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:50,840
So,

88
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:53,800
you'd better stay away from him!

89
00:03:55,520 --> 00:03:57,560
Are you listening?

90
00:03:57,560 --> 00:03:59,080
I'm summarizing what you said.

91
00:03:59,080 --> 00:04:00,680
What's the point of that?

92
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:02,400
Let me put it simply.

93
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,320
Stay away from him

94
00:04:03,320 --> 00:04:04,480
unless you want to be screwed!

95
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:08,040
You were so excited

96
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:09,400
that you didn't make yourself clear.

97
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:11,160
I summarized something for you.

98
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:13,626
In the first few minutes,

99
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:14,960
you demonstrated
your relationship with him.

100
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:16,920
Childhood sweethearts.
Families of equal status.

101
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:20,320
Then you added your achievements.

102
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,200
I failed to congratulate you.

103
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,080
It had nothing to do with me, though.

104
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:27,240
But what you said next
has something to do with me.

105
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:29,480
If I understand correctly,

106
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:30,920
you're threatening me.

107
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:32,640
I'm not threatening you,

108
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:34,720
but warning you.

109
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:35,920
There's no difference.

110
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:37,360
Don't bother!

111
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:38,360
Let me put it simply.

112
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:39,280
Stay away from him

113
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:40,440
unless you want to be screwed!

114
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,880
Let me tell you something, too.

115
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,680
Whether I'm in a relationship
with Ye Juncheng

116
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:44,760
has nothing to do with you.

117
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:45,800
You...

118
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:48,000
Ye Juncheng is independent.

119
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:49,520
He chooses what kind of girl he likes.

120
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:50,600
No one can manipulate him.

121
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:52,560
By the way,

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:53,320
the PPT you made...

123
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:54,600
Oh, no.

124
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:56,360
The PowerPoint you made...

125
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,240
It's ugly.

126

127

Are you listening?

128
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,160
I'm summarizing what you said.

129
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:34,920
(Ye Juncheng)
What's the point of that?

130
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:36,360
Let me put it simply.

131
00:05:36,640 --> 00:05:37,440
