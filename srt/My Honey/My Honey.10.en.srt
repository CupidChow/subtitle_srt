1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:00,960
Su Ziying.

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:09,760
Are you dating this guy?

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,040
Yeah.

4
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,240
Hey!

5
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:22,480
Do you know "first come, first served"?

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,200
How dare you touch my girl!

7
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:26,800
First come, first served?

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:27,760
Funny.

9
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,760
I've only heard
that latecomers getting ahead of others.

10
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:31,880
You're breaking the rule!

11
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:33,000
I am the rule!

12
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:35,560
Are you done staring at each other?

13
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:37,960
Why did you come here?
To stare at each other or read books?

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:39,680
- The latter.
- The latter.

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,560
At ten tomorrow morning,

16
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,360
I'll wait for you at the school gate.

17
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:47,040
Tomorrow morning?

18
00:00:47,560 --> 00:00:48,640
Where will we go?

19
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:49,600
We'll go look for inspiration.

20
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:51,280
And we'll stay out overnight.

21
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:52,560
What?

22
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:54,400
Stay out overnight?

23
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:55,240
I...

24
00:00:56,680 --> 00:00:57,440
You mustn't go.

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:00,800
Stay out overnight?

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,960
Even I haven't stayed out
overnight with her.

27
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:04,780
You want to stay out overnight?

28
00:01:04,780 --> 00:01:08,260
=My Honey=

29
00:01:08,260 --> 00:01:11,020
=EP10 Fight for Her Favor, Men!=

30
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,960
Sorry.

31
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:20,840
I'm late.

32
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,320
If you want Ziying to like you,

33
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:25,960
stop pulling a long face to her.

34
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:27,880
It's okay.

35
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:30,480
A boy is supposed to wait for a girl.

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,600
You...

37
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:33,560
Are you all right?

38
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,560
Here I am.

39
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:37,200
I am free today.

40
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:38,280
Shall we go together?

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:39,720
Juncheng,

42
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,760
you don't mind, do you?

43
00:01:42,520 --> 00:01:44,880
You must be polite
to Ziying's friends, too.

44
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,800
I... I don't mind.

45
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,440
If you don't mind,

46
00:01:49,720 --> 00:01:50,720
take me, too.

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,120
It's getting cold.

48
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,800
I'll go get a coat from the car.

49
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:04,240
- Let me do it.
- Let me do it.

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:10,800
What are they hurrying to do?

51
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:17,160
Give it to me.

52
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:17,880
Wait.

53
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:18,760
Let me wash it.

54
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:19,600
No, no, let me do it.

55
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Me.

56
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:20,480
Me.

57
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:20,760
But...

58
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:21,760
I'll wash it.

59
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:22,640
Let go of it.

60
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:23,520
I'll take care of it.

61
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,200
Here. Here.

62
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:25,200
Wash them.

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:25,840
Thank you.

64
00:02:30,880 --> 00:02:31,800
No, no, no. Here you go.

65
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:32,440
I'll leave them to you.

66
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:38,280
The food is ready.

67
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:40,320
It stinks so much.

68
00:02:41,960 --> 00:02:43,240
It doesn't stink at all.

69
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:43,960
It smells great.

70
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:45,440
Don't touch it.

71
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:46,600
It's mine.

72
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:47,320
It's mine.

73
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,760
You two, leave some food for us.

74
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:50,280
It's mine.

75
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,120
Mine.

76
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:51,760
Mine.

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,160
It's...

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:57,700
We have only one tent.

79
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,970
How shall we sleep tonight?

80
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:00,530
I'll sleep in it.

81
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:01,790
Me, too.

82
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:04,020
It's raining so heavily.

83
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:04,880
I'm not good with cold.

84
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:05,800
It's warm in the tent.

85
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:06,770
I must sleep in it.

86
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:08,030
I'm not good with cold, either.

87
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:09,090
And I'm afraid of the dark.

88
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:10,040
You're a man.

89
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,040
Don't you feel ashamed?

90
00:03:11,550 --> 00:03:12,840
You don't feel ashamed, either.
What's the problem?

91
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:13,240
What did I...?

92
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:14,230
Stop quarreling, both of you.

93
00:03:42,240 --> 00:03:43,030
Su Ziying.

94
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:44,520
Su Ziying.

95
00:03:47,600 --> 00:03:48,400
What's up?

96
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:49,520
Get up for work.

97
00:03:49,800 --> 00:03:50,680
But it's so late.

98
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:52,320
This is your work.

99
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:09,400
Lin Han.

100
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:11,880
You stay.

101
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,160
I have something to tell you.

102
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:21,540
(How lovely can a jealous boyfriend be?)

103
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,360
Do you also like Su Ziying?

104
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:26,600
Don't talk nonsense.

105
00:04:27,320 --> 00:04:28,690
Then you and Ye Juncheng...

106
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,690
I'm the only opposite-sex friend
Su Ziying has had

107
00:04:30,690 --> 00:04:32,400
since she was in middle school.

108
00:04:32,690 --> 00:04:34,920
I don't want her to...

109
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:37,520
How shall I put it?

110
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:39,390
To be seduced by a man.

111
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:41,680
To fall for a honey trap.
Isn't it more appropriate?

112
00:04:42,900 --> 00:04:43,720
Yes, yes.

113
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:44,540
That's it.

114
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:45,850
That's what I mean.
