00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:09,560
Ye Juncheng,

2
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:11,680
when can we get there?

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:13,200
How do I know?

4
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:20,420
Can't you read?

5
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,400
(2012, Star & Moon Lake)
This map was made in 2012.

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,760
Ten years ago.

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:26,120
Maps are similar, aren't they?

8
00:00:26,600 --> 00:00:27,680
I found this map at home.

9
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,440
So, I didn't want to spend five yuan
on a new one.

10
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:31,960
Ye Juncheng,

11
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:33,000
what a miser you are!

12
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:36,550
Su Ziying, are you or are you not going
to find the Star & Moon Lake?

13
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:38,840
I'm not the one who wants to see it.

14
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:41,640
Su Ziying, hurry.

15
00:00:43,720 --> 00:00:44,160
Ouch.

16
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:47,940
=My Honey=

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:48,940
=EP11 Love with One Kiss=

18
00:00:48,940 --> 00:00:50,700
=EP11 Love with Two Kisses=

19
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:00,200
Lin Han.

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:01,480
Mm?

21
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:04,720
I have something to tell you.

22
00:01:06,800 --> 00:01:08,120
You sound terrifying.

23
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:09,880
Don't be so serious, will you?

24
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,120
Be serious.

25
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,560
Think about it.

26
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:19,240
Why did Ye Juncheng take Su Ziying here?

27
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:20,120
He...

28
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:21,520
He likes Su Ziying

29
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:22,720
and he's up to something.

30
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:23,480
Then why are you here?

31
00:01:24,120 --> 00:01:25,240
To protect Su Ziying.

32
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:26,520
Then why am I here?

33
00:01:29,320 --> 00:01:29,880
I don't know.

34
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:31,480
You have to know.

35
00:01:31,480 --> 00:01:33,040
Why do I always follow Su Ziying?

36
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,920
Why do I keep hanging out with you two?

37
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:37,440
And why did I come
all the way to this place?

38
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:42,040
Do you...

39
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:45,560
Do you also like Su Ziying?

40
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,000
Lin Han, you idiot.

41
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,560
Come on.

42
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:52,000
You can't be adoring
the arrogant Ye Juncheng, can you?

43
00:01:52,400 --> 00:01:54,160
He's so annoying.

44
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:55,640
Su Ziying doesn't like him.

45
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:56,440
But he keeps...

46
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:09,560
How thrilling!

47
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,600
Are you all right?

48
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:12,320
Yes.

49
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,320
What were you catching? The void?

50
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:17,040
I didn't expect you
to come down so quickly.

51
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:18,280
And...

52
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,360
If I touch you again,

53
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:21,480
you'll slap me.

54
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:24,200
I think you failed
to catch me deliberately.

55
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:25,400
Stop pretending,

56
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:26,320
or it'll get back to you.

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:27,760
Find the way quickly.

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:34,360
I twisted my ankle.

59
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:35,600
It just got back to you.

60
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:38,820
I twisted it
when I was trying to catch you.

61
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:41,400
What are you staring at me for?

62
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,320
I'm not strong enough to carry you.

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:44,160
I can't walk, anyway.

64
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,080
How about you go without me?

65
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:49,280
Let me stay alone

66
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,160
in the wilderness

67
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,930
to rot.

68
00:02:57,200 --> 00:02:57,760
Su Ziying,

69
00:02:58,200 --> 00:02:58,960
you're really leaving?

70
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,520
How heartless you are!

71
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,080
Hey, Su Ziying.

72
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:05,680
Slow down.

73
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:10,760
So, this is the Star & Moon Lake?

74
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:15,920
Come on.

75
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:18,070
Only the moon

76
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:20,560
and the bulbs...

77
00:03:21,520 --> 00:03:22,880
Why can it be called Star & Moon?

78
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,440
What a waste of time!

79
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,320
Let's get back.

80
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:29,960
Hey, wait.

81
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,360
Look over there.

82
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:54,000
What just happened...

83
00:03:56,360 --> 00:03:57,800
Forget it.

84
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:01,800
Okay, that's good.

85
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:06,800
Shall I not forget it, then?

86
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:08,680
Lin Han,

87
00:04:08,680 --> 00:04:09,840
I'm a hothead.

88
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:11,720
I have to tell you something.

89
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,440
I adore you

90
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:14,720
and I'm up to something.

91
00:04:15,080 --> 00:04:16,240
I'm afraid you would be taken
by some other girl

92
00:04:16,240 --> 00:04:17,280
if I didn't tell you earlier.

93
00:04:23,480 --> 00:04:24,600
I'm done.

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,760
It's your turn to say something.

95
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:31,560
What should I say?

96
00:04:33,800 --> 00:04:36,040
According to idol dramas,

97
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,520
you should say,

98
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:41,120
“Be my girlfriend.”

99
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,840
Fireflies?

100
00:05:00,610 --> 00:05:02,050
So, fireflies are the stars.

101
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:04,400
But fireflies in winter?

102
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:07,360
They're Divine Fireflies, I guess.

103
00:05:08,200 --> 00:05:10,800
They fly in the mountains in winter.

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:15,040
They still glow even when it is
below six degrees centigrade.

105
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:18,800
They look so beautiful.

106
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
They don't fly in winter
to look beautiful,

107
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,360
but for mat...

108
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,320

109

and reproducing.

110
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:30,080
It's animal instinct.

111
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,040
Su Ziying, don't be a buzzkill, okay?

112
