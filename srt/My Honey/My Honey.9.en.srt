1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:02,760
Am I supposed to be the girl

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:04,000
Ye Juncheng met when he was little?

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:05,800
If I am,

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,440
that would be too dramatic.

5
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:10,000
Let me think about it.

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:11,520
When I was little...

7
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:12,720
What are you thinking?

8
00:00:12,720 --> 00:00:13,320
Nothing.

9
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:15,160
You look flurried.

10
00:00:15,160 --> 00:00:18,600
You can't be thinking
of Ye Juncheng, can you?

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,760
Thinking of him?

12
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:20,960
Impossible.

13
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:25,000
According to my love experience
from watching 102 Korean dramas,

14
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,920
I'm sure
you're not only thinking of him,

15
00:00:26,920 --> 00:00:28,800
but also in love with him.

16
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,520
Don't be kidding.

17
00:00:30,520 --> 00:00:32,280
I'm in love with him?

18
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:34,320
He isn't my cup of tea.

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,540
Then who's your cup of tea?

20
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:39,820
=My Honey=

21
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:42,340
=EP9 My Cup of Tea=

22
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,280
I like...

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:45,080
A gentle and sunny boy

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:48,440
who glitters

25
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:51,000
even when he stands there quietly.

26
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,200
Oh.

27
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:55,280
Look, is that the guy
you're talking about?

28
00:01:06,160 --> 00:01:07,560
I like uninhibited

29
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:08,880
and wild rock boys.

30
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:10,280
Right. Wild rock boys.

31
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,880
Oh.

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:17,720
Wait a minute for me.

33
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:19,400
I'll start to paint later.

34
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:21,920
I don't like rock boys.

35
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,840
I like someone
who likes to do the housework.

36
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:30,360
Someone who enjoys ACGN.
[Animation, Comic, Game, and Novel]

37
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,600
Someone who has the mind
of a lovely girl.

38
00:01:44,760 --> 00:01:46,160
Someone who has muscles.

39
00:01:51,640 --> 00:01:52,760
No, no.

40
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,960
I like someone who can understand me.

41
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,120
What's on your mind?

42
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:57,440
I'm done.

43
00:01:58,080 --> 00:01:59,200
Get ready to work.

44
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,400
Look.

45
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,120
If you put the current switch here,

46
00:02:06,440 --> 00:02:09,160
the whole circuit will be short-circuited
just like a glitch in your brain.

47
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:12,520
Then give me more coaching.

48
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,040
Come on.

49
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:17,400
Su Ziying,

50
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,320
are you keeping something from me?

51
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:21,760
What can I keep from you?

52
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:23,440
Just focus on the exercise.

53
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:24,388
Have you mastered
the electromagnetic induction

54
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,360
of the experimental class?

55
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,080
Induction?

56
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:28,600
What induction?

57
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,440
Su Ziying,

58
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,240
do you have chemistry with me?

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:35,240
Stop.

60
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:37,000
You're just a friend.

61
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:39,240
I don't want to be
one of your ex-girlfriends

62
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,120
who threaten to kill themselves for you.

63
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,400
I don't ask them to kill themselves.

64
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:45,240
In love,

65
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,400
no one can control himself.

66
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:51,440
When you said that,

67
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:52,560
you sounded

68
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,760
really like

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,480
a feckless womanizer.

70
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:55,920
I didn't.

you...

73
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,000
You've grown up.

74
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,000
Don't you want to have a relationship

75
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,360
or have chemistry with someone?

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:09,200
Chemistry?

77
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:33,760
Not at all.

78
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:34,920
