You were way too shameless!

For everything.

Tell me.

Under what circumstances
would you let go of me?

27
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:55,840
Be my girlfriend.

28

Anything but this.

29

Anything but this?

(Contract)
I signed the contract for you.

33
00:01:11,480 --> 00:01:13,600
You can't get the money back.

34
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:17,360
I had expected something wiser.

35
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:18,640
But at last, you still used money.

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:20,800
I used my sincerity and true heart.

37
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:22,440
Love can't be rushed.

38
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,400
We need this chance to develop feelings.

39
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:27,080
Get dressed and go out.

40
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:29,600
We invited Ziying to the park
for sketching.

41
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:30,840
Don't be late.

00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:51,000
Su Ziying, what are you wearing?

47
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,280
(Medical isolation mask)
I'm trying to protect you.

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:54,640
As stipulated in the contract

49
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:57,480
I'll keep you company
when you do sketching these days.

50
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,160
In case I hurt you

51
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:00,640
due to unintentional contact,

52
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:01,720
I'll always be wearing this.

53
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:06,680
Then I can touch you
without slapping you.

54
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:07,800
Go.

55
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:08,760
Let's go for the sketching.

56
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:10,680
This is such an ugly place.

57
00:02:11,480 --> 00:02:12,530
I don't have any inspiration.

58
00:02:12,600 --> 00:02:13,440
Even my good mood is ruined.

59
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:15,800
Ye Juncheng,

60
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:18,040
I'm not skipping work.

61
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:19,520
Su Ziying,

62
00:02:19,960 --> 00:02:21,800
if you dare to wear this again tomorrow,

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,600
I'll fire you immediately.

64
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,240
Ye Juncheng, be reasonable, will you?

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:28,200
Boss is always reasonable.

66
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:36,040
Boss,

67
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,040
what are you going to paint today?

68
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,000
Su Ziying,

69
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:42,080
what are you doing again?

70
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:44,080
You asked me
not to wear the protective suit, huh?

71
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:46,160
But I still need necessary protection,

72
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:47,240
right?

73
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:48,920
In case you touch me.

74
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:51,880
Su Ziying,

75
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:53,880
do you fear that I may touch you

76
00:02:57,240 --> 00:02:58,960
or that you can't help touching me?

77
00:03:02,960 --> 00:03:03,840
Keep your distance

78
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,080
and start to paint.

Ah?

88

Do you want to know

89
00:03:33,400 --> 00:03:34,720
why I love painting?

90
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:36,440
I don't.

91
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:42,360
I'm all ears, Boss.

92
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:47,240
Because painting can accelerate time

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:56,280
and get me immersed in my own world.

94
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,680
I feel

95
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,280
that time becomes gentle

96
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,440
and warm.

97
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:03,440
The faster time ticks,

98
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:05,640
the sooner I can see her.

99
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:08,560
Her? Who?

100
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,400
A girl I often saw at the window

101
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,920
when I was little.

102
00:04:14,520 --> 00:04:16,000
Every time she appeared,

103
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,000
she brought me light.

104
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:20,120
Because of her,

105
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:22,200
I painted the first picture of my life.

106
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,000
I wanted to give it to her.

107
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:28,000
Did you meet her later?

108
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:30,640
Later, I moved away too.

109
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,200
Last time

110
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,880
I returned to that place

111
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:35,920
when I looked for your grandma with you.

112
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:39,360
That's my hometown.

113
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:41,160
Do you know her name?

114
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:43,120
I can help you look for her.

115
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:45,960
All I remember is
that her family ran a grocery.

116
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:47,840
Grocery?

117
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,160
In my memories,
for miles around that place,

118
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:52,040
only my family ran a grocery.

119
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,280
I'll go ask my grandma.

120
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:58,600
Maybe she'll know that.
