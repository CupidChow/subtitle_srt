00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:00,480
Bah.

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:02,560
Su Ziying,

3
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:03,760
how weak you were!

4
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:05,400
Why did you just let her
spill the water on you?

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:07,560
What else could I do?

6
00:00:07,810 --> 00:00:10,360
Pull her hair or slap her?

7
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:13,720
After all, she said
she was Ye Juncheng's fiancée.

8
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:14,600
Bah!

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:17,480
Why did you trust her?

10
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,680
An ugly girl like her
just came to make trouble.

11
00:00:20,920 --> 00:00:22,440
You didn't see her.

12
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:23,680
How do you know she's ugly?

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,440
All girls

14
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,440
who play dirty tricks

15
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:28,920
are either ugly or malicious.

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,360
By the way,

17
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:34,920
you and Ye Juncheng
kissed several times.

18
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,600
You should have been in a relationship.

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,640
Based on my experience
from 102 Korean dramas

20
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,400
and my first love,

21
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,560
nothing in love should be delayed.

22
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:48,120
Your first love?

23
00:00:48,720 --> 00:00:49,640
When did you and Lin Han

24
00:00:50,560 --> 00:00:52,200
start a relationship?

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:55,080
Not yet.

26
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,000
But soon, I guess.

27
00:00:58,400 --> 00:00:59,120
Su Ziying,

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:00,440
don't interrupt.

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,080
We're talking about your problem.

30
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:04,080
When will you be
in a relationship with him?

31
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:07,120
I don't know.

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:12,760
Then go ask him.

33
00:01:12,760 --> 00:01:14,200
A girl of the new era

34
00:01:14,440 --> 00:01:15,600
should be active

35
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,000
and daring in love.

36
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,280
Go. Go right away.

39
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:31,080
There you are.

40
00:01:35,470 --> 00:01:37,000
Juncheng, what makes you so happy?

41
00:01:37,480 --> 00:01:39,800
I knew you cared for me.

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,150
Why is it you?

43
00:01:41,480 --> 00:01:42,470
How did you come in?

44
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:43,720
Your mother told me

45
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,400
the password to your door, of course.

46
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:47,520
I don't care how you got in.

47
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:48,320
Get out immediately.

48
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:49,920
Oh, dear.

49
00:01:50,480 --> 00:01:51,760
You know.

50
00:01:51,760 --> 00:01:53,320
I just came back to China

51
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,440
and I have nowhere to live.

52
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,960
See? I've brought my luggage.

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,400
I can book a hotel room for you.

54
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
No. I want to stay here.

55
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:04,840
Ye Juncheng...

56
00:02:09,040 --> 00:02:11,640
Juncheng, I said I could
carry the luggage myself.

57
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:16,600
Sorry to have interrupted you.

58
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:19,280

(Girls' Dormitory No admission for Boys)

61

This is the Girls' Dormitory.

62
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,240
You mustn't come in.

63

Come on.

64
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:31,160
Su Ziying misunderstood me.

65
00:02:31,160 --> 00:02:32,200
I have to explain to her.

66
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,080
Well, well,

67
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:35,440
I guess someone should
solve his problem first.

Hey, what are you doing here?

69

This is the Girls' Dormitory. Go, go, go.

70
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:40,640
Get out.

71
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:41,480
Leave immediately.

72
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:50,240
The game against Zhongyang Academy of Art
is a few days away.

73
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:52,080
We haven't got a point guard yet.

Lin Han,

75
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:53,960
what do you think we should do?

76
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:57,560
Shall we

77
00:02:57,920 --> 00:02:59,160
search different grades for one?

78
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:00,600
Mm.

79
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:03,240
We lost to Zhongyang Academy of Art
for consecutive years.

80
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:04,880
If we lose again,

81
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:06,680
what a humiliation it'll be!

82
00:03:06,880 --> 00:03:07,550
Yeah.

83
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:09,440
Hey.

84
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,000
Watch out!

85
00:03:22,960 --> 00:03:24,520
Lin Han, are you all right?

86
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,360
Ye Juncheng?

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:28,400
To what honor do I owe this?

88
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:33,120

she doesn't want to see you now.

No.

92
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:37,240
I'm here to see you.

93
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:39,560
Me?

94
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:41,250
Lin Han,

95
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:42,840
do me a favor.

96
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,640
I want to explain to Su Ziying.

Don't try to play tricks.

98

I don't buy it.

99

What do you buy, then?

100

I can do anything.

No, no, no.

Stay away from me.

103

I won't sell out my friend for anything.

104

I just won't.

105

Are you sure?

106
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:19,840
I heard you needed a point guard.

107
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:23,680
Aha.

108
