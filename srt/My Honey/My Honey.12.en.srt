Did you have a secret date

with Ye Juncheng?

we suffered a lot in the forest.

A lot?

Mm.

Get packed quickly.

I can't walk.

Don't stare at me like that.

I can't watch such scenes anymore.

kissed?

Did he force a kiss on you?

If it has to be something,

who forced a kiss on him.

Come on.

71
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:02,600
When you like someone,

72
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:03,640
you should let him know.

73
00:03:04,240 --> 00:03:05,960
I don't want to be dilatory.

74
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:10,960
So, did you tell Ye Juncheng?

75
00:03:11,320 --> 00:03:12,280
What?

76
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:13,840
Tell him that you like him.

77
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:14,920
Don't talk nonsense.

78
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,040
Su Ziying,

79
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:18,120
you're screwed, too.

80
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:19,560
You're in love.

81
00:03:20,160 --> 00:03:21,720
You don't even dare to deny it.

82
00:03:22,280 --> 00:03:24,760
I told you what I did to Lin Han.

83
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:26,640
You should tell me what happened, too.

84
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:29,400
You and Ye Juncheng
were gone last night.

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,760
Didn't you...?

86
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,170
Wait.

87
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:40,440
Su Ziying, you have
skin-to-skin heterophobia, don't you?

88
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:42,200
Did you

89
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:44,360
beat Ye Juncheng

90
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:46,240
so that he was crippled?

91
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:49,920
I'm confused, too.

92
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:52,400
Why are my symptoms gone?

93
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:55,640
Based on my experience
from 102 Korean dramas

94
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:58,640
and my coming first love,

95
00:03:59,240 --> 00:04:01,280
your illness is just psychological.

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,270
Perhaps you've accepted
Ye Juncheng in your heart.

97
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:06,480
So,

98
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,120
you're willing to get close to him.

99
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:15,440
Grandma, who am I?

100
00:04:15,440 --> 00:04:18,040
Ziying, don't be silly.

101
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:21,320
I just worry that you would forget me.

102
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,600
Come on.

103
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:23,960
Look.

104
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:26,160
What's this?

In case I forget you,

106
