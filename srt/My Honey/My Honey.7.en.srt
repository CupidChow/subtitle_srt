What is wrong with Ye Juncheng?

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:06,040
I think he's kind of overbearing.

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:07,200
Like a boss.

5

You think this is what a boss did?

Right.

12

Girls don't like such bossy guys.

Apply it when you're back to your dorm.

have you ever pursued a girl?

I've never needed to pursue a girl.

45
