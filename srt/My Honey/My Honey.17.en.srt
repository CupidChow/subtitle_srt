Doctor, be gentle! Be gentle!

Relax. Relax.

5
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,720
I haven't started yet.

6
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:07,040
Doctor, ignore him.

7
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:07,840
Finish up with splints on him.

Listen to her.

It hurts.

Be gentle. Be gentle.

Ye Juncheng, I was hurt because of you.

Be gentle. Be gentle.

Stop shouting.

15
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,800
So, I allowed you to live in my home

16
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:31,440
and offered a private doctor.

17

Stop yelling. Stop it.

What do you want?

24
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:01,600
About Hua Yun,

25
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,120
I want to explain it to you personally.

26
00:01:04,160 --> 00:01:04,510
Okay.

27
00:01:04,520 --> 00:01:04,960
Go ahead.

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:06,280
Be specific.

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:07,360
Don't miss anything.

30
00:01:08,360 --> 00:01:09,400
Don't you think

31
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:11,240
you sound too assertive?

32
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:13,680
You insist on explaining to me

33
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:14,840
and you're in the wrong.

34
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:16,280
So, either with feelings

35
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:17,280
or with reasons,

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:18,920
I can be more assertive, right?

37
00:01:19,640 --> 00:01:21,600
You made impeccable sense.

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:23,760
You can tell your story.

39
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:26,820
In short,

40
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:28,080
Hua Yun likes me,

41
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,080
but I don't like her.

42
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:30,640
I've never liked her.

43
00:01:31,240 --> 00:01:32,080
Are you...?

44
00:01:32,080 --> 00:01:32,800
We're never engaged.

45
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:33,880
Did you...?

46
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:35,680
I never gave her any promise
either explicitly or implicitly.

47
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:37,040
Do your parents...?

48
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:38,880
My parents' will can't interfere
with my choice.

49
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:41,150
You still don't believe me?

50
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:43,430
Do I have to say

51
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,040
that before I met you,

52
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:46,360
I had been a bachelor?

53
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,000
What?

54
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,320
Bachelor.

55
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,040
It means he's been single.

56
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:52,080
Up to now.

57
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:56,400
So, he's an innocent virgin
who has never been in a relationship.

58
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:57,600
Believe it or not,
I'll beat you even if you're wounded.

59
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,440
- Don't.
- Don't.

60

We'll leave you alone.

Do you want me to defeat you again?

80
00:02:56,120 --> 00:02:57,600
Are you trying to enrage me?

81
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:58,720

No way.
