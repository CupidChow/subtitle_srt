1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:01,080
Come on.

2
00:00:01,360 --> 00:00:03,040
If you want to cry, cry in my arms.

3
00:00:06,280 --> 00:00:07,520
How shall I put it?

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,000
Friendship comes

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:09,800
before competition.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:14,320
It's about taking part.

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:15,000
Lin Han,

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:15,880
- shut up!
- Shut up!

9
00:00:17,240 --> 00:00:17,640
Come on.

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:18,120
I'm okay.

11
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:19,440
Don't be overacting.

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:21,000
You're certainly okay.

13
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Su Ziying confessed love to you.

14
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,200
It's more valuable than anything.

15
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:26,400
What is the saying?

16
00:00:27,280 --> 00:00:29,440
I lost the whole world, but I got you.

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:31,440
Focus on your snacks.

18
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:33,280
Under specific circumstances,

19
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,240
I was just talking about the painting.

20
00:00:34,240 --> 00:00:35,160
When did I confess my love?

21
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:36,440
Tut-tut.

22
00:00:36,720 --> 00:00:37,800
Su Ziying,

23
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:39,480
I've known you for years,

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,840
but I didn't know you could be so brave.

25
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:42,840
Lin Han.

26
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:44,400
Ye Juncheng, look.

27
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:46,040
Su Ziying is taking advantage
of her illness again.

28
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:47,200
Come on, slap him as you wish.

29
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,560
Well, when you two tease each other,

30
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,680
don't hurt the innocent guy.

31
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:51,760
That's right.

32
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:52,480
Wanqian, you...

33
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,480
Forget it. Let's just drink.

34
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:54,880
Here.

35
00:00:54,880 --> 00:00:55,720
Cheers.

36
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:57,680
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

37
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:00,440
I'll get you three drunk tonight.

38
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:30,040
Ye Juncheng,

39
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:30,800
come on.

40
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:31,720
I believe in you.

41
00:01:39,120 --> 00:01:39,840
(No.)

42
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:41,400
(I can't let him out.)

43
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:42,800
(I must hold back my desire.)

44
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,400
Thank you.

45
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,900
=My Honey=

46
00:02:02,900 --> 00:02:05,660
=EP19 You Confessed Love First=

47
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:09,680
Morning.

48
00:02:10,480 --> 00:02:11,400
You're awake?

49
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,200
Last night, we messed up your home.

50
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:16,240
I'll go tidy it up later.

51
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,360
You messed up my heart, too.

52
00:02:21,160 --> 00:02:21,760
How about

53
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:23,780
fixing it up?

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:26,880
Don't talk nonsense.

55
00:02:28,760 --> 00:02:29,520
Last night,

56
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:31,320
you told me many secrets

57
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,480
that I didn't know before.

58
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:33,520
What did I say?

59
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:34,880
You don't remember?

60
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:37,480
Well,

61
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,720
all secrets you had since you were born.

62
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
And all the dark secrets you keep.

63
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:43,640
You've told me everything.

64
00:02:43,880 --> 00:02:44,640
No way.

65
00:02:45,520 --> 00:02:46,240
Ye Juncheng,

66
00:02:46,240 --> 00:02:47,200
you know what?

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:48,000
Don't try to blackmail me.

68
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:50,320
I don't have dark secrets.

69
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,320
Well...

70
00:02:52,960 --> 00:02:54,080
You love me.

71
00:02:54,760 --> 00:02:55,560
Isn't it a secret?

72
00:02:56,960 --> 00:02:57,640
Ye Juncheng, you...

73
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,440
You indeed said that.

74
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:01,640
I don't care.

75
00:03:02,320 --> 00:03:03,800
Now that you said you love me,

76
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:05,240
you must be responsible for me.

77
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:09,480
Su Ziying,

78
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:12,640
are you going to deny it?

79
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:17,160

I always answer for what I did.

81
