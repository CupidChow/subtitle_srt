00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:04,440
Yeah!

5
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,280
Isn't this too dramatic?

6
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,320
There's something more dramatic.

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:12,720
Oh.

8
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:14,920
Ta-da.

00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,840
Happy birthday, Su Ziying!

10

Happy Birthday!

11
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:24,760
What are you? A repeater?

12
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:28,000
I didn't spend your birthday
in the past 21 years.

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:30,720
I'd like to say
"Happy Birthday" 21 times first.

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,920
For each of your birthdays after,

15
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:33,120
I'll be with you.

16
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,400
He's so romantic.

17
00:00:36,240 --> 00:00:37,080
He is?

18
00:00:37,560 --> 00:00:38,760
When you're 80,

19
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,800
I'll say "Happy Birthday" to you
80 times at one time.

20
00:00:41,400 --> 00:00:41,880
Good girl.

21
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:43,320
You have no idea.

22

All right. All right.

Time is running out.

24
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:46,480
You should make a wish.

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:47,800
I'll go turn off the light.

26
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:48,280
Okay.

27
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:49,760
You...

28
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:50,720
Light the candles.

29
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,000
All right. Don't rush me.

I'm not scared.

I was quite unlucky.

First,

55
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:06,280
I fell in the studio

56

and made myself very awkward.

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,880
Later, I found
that you were afraid of the dark.

58
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:12,240
I pulled your shirt

59
00:02:12,240 --> 00:02:13,800
and took you to somewhere brighter.

60
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:17,360
I don't even know
why I fell in love with you.

61
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,520
There's no reason in love.
