What is this weird illness?

(Lin Han)
Skin-to-skin heterophobia.

23
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:11,880
A form of OCD.

24
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:13,720
To put it simply,

25
00:01:13,720 --> 00:01:16,600
she's scared of any skin contact
with the opposite sex.

26
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:17,720
She can't touch a male

and be touched by a male.

28

What?

You don't understand?

30
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:23,880
Let me show you.

31
00:01:26,200 --> 00:01:27,120
Like this.

32
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:28,360
When I touch her through her coat,

33
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:29,440
it's okay.

34
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:31,680
But if I do like this...

35
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:36,680
Three, two, one.

36
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,080
Now you understand, huh?

Come on.

Su Ziying,

39
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:49,760
isn't it a standard plot in idol dramas?

40
00:01:49,760 --> 00:01:51,060
You're the heroine with an illness

41
00:01:51,080 --> 00:01:53,180
and you bumped
into the hero dramatically.

42
00:01:54,400 --> 00:01:56,400
So vulgar but exciting.

43
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:57,280
Stop.

44
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:59,160
I hear that junior

45

parked his car in the principal's spot
on his first day to school.

46
00:02:01,880 --> 00:02:02,960
I don't want to screw with him.

Hey.

Don't be scared.

I'll protect you.

All right, Lin Han.

51
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:10,080
I'm going to work part-time
in the library.

52
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:11,720
And I have a part-time job
in a shopping mall tonight.

53
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:12,520
I should go.

54
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:14,840
Okay.

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:16,120
Class,

56
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:18,920
I've especially invited
a senior girl of yours

57
00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:19,760
to be your model today.

58
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:21,840
When you paint,

59
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,160
pay attention to the perspective
and the contrast of objects and shades.

60
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,680
Okay. Here you go.

61
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:29,720
Sir,

62
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
could you ask her to take off her coat?

63
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,400
(This guy looks ugly from behind.)

64
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:34,600
(It can't be...)

65
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,160
I want to get a good look
at the model's body shape.

66
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:37,480
(It's really him.)

67
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:39,040
I won't take it off, junior.

68
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,320
No such request has been made before.

69
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,040
How about you put on that dress?

70
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:45,080
I believe it conforms better
to oil painting aesthetics.

71
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,880
Junior,

72
00:02:51,880 --> 00:02:52,920
are you here to paint

73
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,320
or take revenge?

74
00:02:54,320 --> 00:02:55,800
Senior,

75
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,160
are you here to serve as a model

76
00:02:57,160 --> 00:02:58,360
or quarrel with me?

77
00:02:58,440 --> 00:02:59,240
Come on.

78
00:02:59,240 --> 00:03:00,960
You two, stop.

79
00:03:00,960 --> 00:03:02,120
Let's not change anything today,

80
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:02,880
okay?

81
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:03,960
All right. Class, here you go.

82
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:04,360
Hurry.

83
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:07,280
I can get changed.

84
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,040
But it charges

85
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:11,480
an extra price.

86
00:03:14,160 --> 00:03:15,120
What's the price?

87
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:17,280
The market price is 800 yuan.

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:18,880
You can pay as much as you want.

89
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:24,640
(8.8 yuan received on WeChat)

90
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:25,760
8.8 yuan?

91
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,280
You asked me to pay as much as I wanted.

92
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:28,120
You...

93
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:43,200

(Seriously?)

- (Are boys nowadays so weak?)
- Buddy...

105
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:03,840
Why did that guy faint
simply after I slapped him?

106
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,560
Will a young girl like me
be responsible for a man's death?

107
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:08,600
Ouch.

108
00:04:12,440 --> 00:04:14,600
Boy, you can't do this.

109

Nothing?

113
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:22,320
Then why is my son crying?

114
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:22,960
What a rude girl you are!

115
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:23,680
I really did nothing.
