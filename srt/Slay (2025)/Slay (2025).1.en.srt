1
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:13,747
(Upbeat tempo)

2
00:00:20,253 --> 00:00:23,423
They say a woman is like fire.

3
00:00:24,057 --> 00:00:25,991
She will give you a warm hug

4
00:00:25,992 --> 00:00:27,394
on a cold night.

5
00:00:28,595 --> 00:00:31,163
A woman is like fire.

6
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,400
A light that will guide you in the dark.

7
00:00:34,401 --> 00:00:36,001
She is hot.

8
00:00:36,002 --> 00:00:37,736
She will ignite your deepest,

9
00:00:37,737 --> 00:00:39,105
darkest desire.

10
00:00:40,607 --> 00:00:44,577
As kids, we were taught
not to play with fire.

11
00:00:45,779 --> 00:00:47,380
And just like fire,

12
00:00:48,481 --> 00:00:50,750
you shouldn’t play with a woman’s heart.

13
00:00:51,985 --> 00:00:55,789
Just like fire, a woman is deadly.

14
00:00:56,389 --> 00:00:59,458
A woman’s rage is uncontrollable.

15
00:00:59,459 --> 00:01:02,828
Her small spark can set
off a massive wildfire.

16
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,597
So be careful,

17
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:07,132
there is nothing deadlier-

18
00:01:07,133 --> 00:01:09,302
Than a woman on fire.

19
00:01:14,174 --> 00:01:24,417
(Blaring trumpet / upbeat instrumental)

20
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:57,383
(Upbeat instrumental continues)

21
00:02:01,354 --> 00:02:02,355
(Phone tone sound)

22
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:08,894
"- You’re so hot, Coach Zach!"
"- So lit, bro."

23
00:02:08,895 --> 00:02:10,529
"Is it summertime already?
Why are you making me sweat?"

24
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:12,531
"- Looking good, sir!"
"- Internet legend!"

25
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:15,401
"- Mom, rice please! Coach Zach’s abs
is my main dish!"

26
00:03:00,246 --> 00:03:02,582
And before we end another episode

27
00:03:03,116 --> 00:03:05,051
of workout with Coach Z,

28
00:03:05,985 --> 00:03:09,923
let’s remember to pause, meditate.

29
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:33,179
(Zach screaming)
(Alarm blaring)

30
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:49,762
(Zach screaming)
(Alarm blaring)

31
00:03:55,201 --> 00:03:58,171
(Zach screaming)

32
00:03:58,304 --> 00:03:59,205
Coach?!

33
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,206
Coach?!

34
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,375
Oh my god!

35
00:04:04,377 --> 00:04:05,378
Coach?!

36
00:04:05,612 --> 00:04:06,679
Coach?!

37
00:04:09,315 --> 00:04:10,216
Coach?!

38
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:11,184
Oh my!

39
00:04:12,652 --> 00:04:16,022
Let’s remember to pause, meditate,

40
00:04:16,222 --> 00:04:18,324
and let your body rest.

41
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:23,930
(Beeping sound)
"- What a waste, you were so hot."

42
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:24,963
"- Rest in peace, Idol"

43
00:04:24,964 --> 00:04:26,365
"- Such a a tragedy, my condolences"

44
00:04:26,366 --> 00:04:27,533
"- Was it really an accident?"

45
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:29,067
"- Foul play!"

46
00:04:29,068 --> 00:04:30,402
"- I bet someone was jealous
because he’s famous."

47
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:32,071
"- Who killed Zach??"

48
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,829
Coach Zach is still alive, right?

49
00:05:30,463 --> 00:05:31,464
I don’t know,

50
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,900
let’s just hope for the best.

51
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,004
Turn on the emergency light!

52
00:05:39,806 --> 00:05:42,007
I’m Inspector Juro Catapang,

53
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:43,675
lead investigator in this case.

54
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,210
Come with me.

55
00:05:45,211 --> 00:05:46,713
I need your statement.

56
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,951
(Clock ticking)

57
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:57,456
How and why did Zach Zamora
burst into flames?

58
00:05:57,457 --> 00:05:58,925
From what I heard,

59
00:05:59,692 --> 00:06:01,461
Zach wasn’t a saint.

60
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:06,499
I’m not so surprised
this happened to him.

61
00:06:06,833 --> 00:06:08,501
Coach Zach was my boss.

62
00:06:09,736 --> 00:06:11,504
I’m a chef at his restaurant.

63
00:06:11,671 --> 00:06:12,672
Since when?

64
00:06:13,005 --> 00:06:14,574
Just recently.

65
00:06:14,741 --> 00:06:16,409
Not even a month.

66
00:06:17,844 --> 00:06:19,112
How was he as a boss?

67
00:06:21,514 --> 00:06:22,749
Olivia Baltazar.

68
00:06:22,882 --> 00:06:24,516
Just call me Liv, Inspector.

69
00:06:24,517 --> 00:06:27,419
Out of all days, this had to happen today.

70
00:06:27,420 --> 00:06:29,222
It’s your anniversary with Zach, isn’t it?

71
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,291
Did I say something wrong?

72
00:06:32,492 --> 00:06:33,692
No, you’re right.

73
00:06:33,693 --> 00:06:37,029
It’s been a year since Zach
and I got together.

74
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:42,367
One year of being happily in love.

75
00:06:42,368 --> 00:06:43,302
(Camera shutter)

76
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:44,270
Ten seconds left.

77
00:06:44,270 --> 00:06:45,071
Don’t give up!

78
00:06:45,071 --> 00:06:45,538
Go!

79
00:06:45,538 --> 00:06:46,205
Keep going!

80
00:06:46,206 --> 00:06:48,874
Eight, seven, six, five,

81
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:52,043
four, three, two, one!

82
00:06:52,044 --> 00:06:53,545
Yehey!

83
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:54,547
Woah!

84
00:06:54,714 --> 00:06:55,714
Yeah!

85
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:56,849
Good job, baby!

86
00:06:56,883 --> 00:06:57,750
Good job!

87
00:06:57,751 --> 00:06:59,752
Good job! Good job!

88
00:06:59,786 --> 00:07:01,253
My good girl. My good girl.

89
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:02,622
Put me down! Put me down!

90
00:07:02,722 --> 00:07:04,223
- I’m lifting you even higher!
- Oh my god!

91
00:07:05,224 --> 00:07:06,391
Everyone’s looking at us!

92
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,526
Hey, a lot of people are staring!

93
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:09,895
- This is embarrassing.
- So what? Let them stare.

94
00:07:09,896 --> 00:07:10,897
I don’t care.

95
00:07:12,231 --> 00:07:14,734
I’m not used to getting attention like you.

96
00:07:15,334 --> 00:07:18,103
Love, get used to it, okay?

97
00:07:18,104 --> 00:07:20,606
I courted you for a year
before you said yes.

98
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:22,274
We can’t keep this private.

99
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:23,075
Not at all.

100
00:07:23,075 --> 00:07:23,910
Yeah.

101
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:25,811
As early as now, as early as now, love,

102
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:30,983
I will let the whole world know that
I love this woman very much!

103
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:33,885
- I love this woman very much!
- Keep it down!

104
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:35,087
Hey! My god!

105
00:07:39,258 --> 00:07:40,126
See?

106
00:07:40,827 --> 00:07:41,427
What?

107
00:07:41,428 --> 00:07:42,761
Welcome.
(Chuckles)

108
00:07:42,762 --> 00:07:44,263
What is this place?

109
00:07:48,167 --> 00:07:50,101
I bet it’s your first time here.

110
00:07:50,102 --> 00:07:51,436
Yeah.

111
00:07:51,437 --> 00:07:52,004
What?

112
00:07:52,005 --> 00:07:53,306
This is so cool.

113
00:07:53,973 --> 00:07:54,973
I didn’t know this place even existed.

114
00:07:54,974 --> 00:07:55,775
Yes.

115
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,612
I learned about this
when I was training in Thailand.

116
00:08:00,279 --> 00:08:04,116
I figured that it’s better to meditate
with incense after working out.

117
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,220
(Glass tapping)
Solid right?

118
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:08,821
- Exactly!
- Eight feet tall,

119
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:10,289
fireproof,

120
00:08:10,456 --> 00:08:12,225
shock proof,

121
00:08:14,126 --> 00:08:16,595
and it’s literally unbreakable.

122
00:08:16,596 --> 00:08:17,530
(Glass door opening)

123
00:08:18,331 --> 00:08:18,965
Wow!

124
00:08:18,966 --> 00:08:20,032
Wait till you get inside,

125
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:21,367
it’s so peaceful.

126
00:08:21,400 --> 00:08:23,302
This makes meditating so much better.

127
00:08:23,803 --> 00:08:25,471
It’s so relaxing,

128
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:27,373
and it gives you a sense of clarity.

129
00:08:27,473 --> 00:08:29,809
(Beeping sound) (Door opens)
You wanna go inside?

130
00:08:29,842 --> 00:08:30,610
Okay.

131
00:08:30,611 --> 00:08:32,078
Get inside, try it out.

132
00:08:33,646 --> 00:08:35,314
What? I’ll take my shoes off, alright?

133
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:38,017
- Yes, please.
- I don't want to make it dirty.

134
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:40,953
- Okay
- What? It’s so cool!

135
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:43,055
I know, right?
Do you notice how quiet it is inside?

136
00:08:44,156 --> 00:08:45,825
This is so cool!
(Door closing)

137
00:08:47,493 --> 00:08:48,728
Sit down, baby.

138
00:08:48,961 --> 00:08:50,630
Okay.

139
00:09:04,343 --> 00:09:05,645
Okay, we’re ready.

140
00:09:05,811 --> 00:09:07,712
Is that a firework?
Why is it taking so long to light up?

141
00:09:07,713 --> 00:09:09,048
(Both laughing)

142
00:09:10,182 --> 00:09:13,852
Okay. So, first step.

143
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,387
Okay.

144
00:09:14,388 --> 00:09:15,555
Close your eyes.

145
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,023
Close my eyes.

146
00:09:18,424 --> 00:09:20,359
And then, let’s start with breathing.

147
00:09:20,560 --> 00:09:23,361
Breathe in through your nose,

148
00:09:23,362 --> 00:09:24,764
breathe out through your mouth.

149
00:09:25,264 --> 00:09:29,302
(Deep breath)

150
00:09:35,408 --> 00:09:37,576
I nearly crashed into his car,
how frustrating. It’s his fault for not making way.

151
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,277
Why?

152
00:09:38,377 --> 00:09:39,278
It was embarrassing towards-

153
00:09:39,545 --> 00:09:40,446
What?

154
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,881
Auntie, good evening.

155
00:09:43,449 --> 00:09:46,385
Zach, good night!

156
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:49,288
You guys got home late,

157
00:09:49,422 --> 00:09:50,056
don’t you think?

158
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,057
It’s pretty late.

159
00:09:51,390 --> 00:09:52,958
Babe, good night.

160
00:09:52,959 --> 00:09:54,026
Love you.

161
00:09:54,393 --> 00:09:56,062
Bye, take care.

162
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:05,271
Do you guys use condoms?

163
00:10:05,504 --> 00:10:08,139
Mom, stop! He might hear you!

164
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,308
Oh please.

165
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:15,580
Don’t you know that STD cases
among teenagers are rising because

166
00:10:15,581 --> 00:10:18,783
they aren't properly informed
about reproductive health?

167
00:10:18,784 --> 00:10:20,652
Aren’t you aware of that?
I’m worried!

168
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:21,487
Well, actually,

169
00:10:21,488 --> 00:10:23,889
we both made an agreement, Mom,

170
00:10:25,358 --> 00:10:27,426
that we’ll wait

171
00:10:28,527 --> 00:10:29,929
until we get married.

172
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:31,764
And did he agree to that?

173
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,500
Given his looks,
it seems like a lot of people

174
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,469
are drawn to him,
offering things you can’t provide.

175
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:39,839
Mom, Zach respects my decision.

176
00:10:40,272 --> 00:10:43,776
Actually, I appreciate him
even more because of that.

177
00:10:43,909 --> 00:10:47,313
At first, I admit...
he was quite arrogant.

178
00:10:47,747 --> 00:10:51,384
But you know, I got to know him.

179
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,786
He’s just, he’s just really nice.

180
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:55,955
He’s a nice guy.

181
00:10:56,288 --> 00:10:58,124
To be young and idealistic.

182
00:10:59,091 --> 00:11:02,560
Mom, not all guys are exactly like dad.

183
00:11:02,561 --> 00:11:04,664
There are loyal and
faithful ones out there.

184
00:11:05,831 --> 00:11:07,465
Would you like me to
find you a boyfriend?

185
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:08,633
Oh no! Please stop.

186
00:11:08,634 --> 00:11:09,368
I don’t want that.

187
00:11:09,368 --> 00:11:10,336
I’m not interested on having a boyfriend.

188
00:11:10,337 --> 00:11:11,804
I’m completely fine being on my own.

189
00:11:11,937 --> 00:11:13,204
Don’t you want to have a companion?

190
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:14,973
After what your Dad did to me?

191
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:17,108
It’s like I’ve had enough
at this point, right?

192
00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:18,677
I’m done with all the drama.

193
00:11:18,678 --> 00:11:19,712
I’m good now.

194
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:23,983
Stop giving me all these ideas.

195
00:11:25,217 --> 00:11:27,653
How amazing, love!

196
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:30,021
I didn’t know you make your own meals.

197
00:11:30,022 --> 00:11:30,990
No, I did not.

198
00:11:30,991 --> 00:11:32,858
Sugar made all of these.

199
00:11:33,125 --> 00:11:36,795
I’m just very very lucky that
I found a boarder who’s nice,

200
00:11:36,796 --> 00:11:38,898
and you know, a good cook.

201
00:11:39,165 --> 00:11:41,900
You’re still lucky to have me
because apparently,

202
00:11:41,901 --> 00:11:43,835
your boyfriend also knows how to cook.

203
00:11:43,836 --> 00:11:45,170
I made this for you.

204
00:11:45,171 --> 00:11:45,871
You made that?

205
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:46,572
Yeah!

206
00:11:46,572 --> 00:11:47,173
Really?

207
00:11:47,174 --> 00:11:48,174
Of course.

208
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,874
Strawberry pancake?

209
00:11:49,875 --> 00:11:50,843
(Utensils clinking)
What’s wrong with that?

210
00:11:50,844 --> 00:11:52,912
This is the only thing I can show off.

211
00:11:53,279 --> 00:11:58,017
It’s the only dish Mommy taught me
how to make before she-

212
00:11:59,018 --> 00:11:59,719
you know.

213
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:06,525
But isn’t this fattening?
(Liv laughing)

214
00:12:06,759 --> 00:12:08,193
It kind of ruins the workout, doesn’t it?

215
00:12:08,194 --> 00:12:10,028
That’s fine, it’s easy to burn anyway.

216
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,362
And besides, it’s Tuesday.

217
00:12:11,363 --> 00:12:12,565
It’s our cheat day,

218
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:14,733
so it’s fine for you to eat that.

219
00:12:14,734 --> 00:12:16,936
Fine then, let me try it.
Go ahead, try it out.

220
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:18,236
Okay

221
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:21,207
Oh, just a moment, let me get some extra syrup,
so it’ll taste even more delicious.

222
00:12:28,180 --> 00:12:32,318
(Cell phone vibrating)

223
00:12:36,722 --> 00:12:37,756
(Suspenseful music starts)

224
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:39,959
Hey, Coach Z!
Did you like my nude photos?

225
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:45,497
You weren’t around
when I went to the gym.

226
00:12:45,498 --> 00:12:46,565
Can you train me
personally again?

227
00:12:46,732 --> 00:12:47,566
Babe, here.

228
00:12:48,868 --> 00:12:49,468
Hey!

229
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:50,503
Give me that!

230
00:12:52,404 --> 00:12:55,206
So today really is your cheat day, huh?

231
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,208
What do you mean?

232
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:58,110
Why is someone sending you nude photos?

233
00:13:00,212 --> 00:13:03,682
Zach, I do not like cheaters.

234
00:13:04,583 --> 00:13:06,418
My dad cheated on my mom before.

235
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:09,889
Hold on...

236
00:13:13,159 --> 00:13:14,259
What are you talking about?

237
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,128
I don’t even know who this woman is.

238
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:17,763
So, why-

239
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:19,231
Take a look at this,
see for yourself.

240
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:20,432
Look at this.

241
00:13:20,433 --> 00:13:22,167
I never responded to her.

242
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,768
So why is she sending you nude photos?

243
00:13:23,769 --> 00:13:24,769
Who is she?

244
00:13:24,770 --> 00:13:25,471
I don’t know.

245
00:13:25,472 --> 00:13:27,173
Probably because I’m famous?

246
00:13:29,108 --> 00:13:33,012
Cause I’m the most popular
fitness influencer right now.

247
00:13:34,446 --> 00:13:40,319
Baby, I think you have to
accept that...

248
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:43,088
girls flock to me.

249
00:13:44,824 --> 00:13:46,090
See for yourself, look at her face,

250
00:13:46,091 --> 00:13:47,693
do you think I would
engage with that woman?

251
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,494
Come on!

252
00:13:49,495 --> 00:13:51,797
You know, if I’m picky with my food,

253
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,732
then I’m even more picky with women.

254
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:57,969
That’s why I chose someone special like you.

255
00:13:57,970 --> 00:14:00,105
Love, you have to believe me.

256
00:14:00,472 --> 00:14:01,207
Think about it,

257
00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:03,876
would I have given you my password
if I was hiding something from you?

258
00:14:03,976 --> 00:14:05,477
I don’t think so, right?
It’s nothing.

259
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,114
I haven’t been cheating,
and I’ve always been honest to you.

260
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:34,974
Hello there, ma’am!

261
00:14:35,074 --> 00:14:37,142
Hello. How are you doing, Daisy?

262
00:14:37,209 --> 00:14:38,177
Where’s Amelie?

263
00:14:38,178 --> 00:14:39,712
Oh, over there, ma’am.

264
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:42,014
I see, thank you.

265
00:14:49,188 --> 00:14:50,356
Hey!

266
00:14:52,791 --> 00:14:53,525
(Glass clinking)

267
00:14:54,894 --> 00:14:55,761
Guess what?

268
00:14:56,195 --> 00:14:57,096
What?

269
00:14:58,764 --> 00:14:59,932
Luke just proposed.

270
00:15:01,367 --> 00:15:02,268
Wait, wait, wait.

271
00:15:03,736 --> 00:15:04,637
Let me do that again.

272
00:15:06,038 --> 00:15:08,206
Luke just proposed!

273
00:15:08,207 --> 00:15:09,207
(Percussive instrumental)

274
00:15:09,208 --> 00:15:11,042
Oh my god, Congrats!

275
00:15:11,043 --> 00:15:12,343
Yeah, Thank you.

276
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:14,379
Actually, the set up was really nice.

277
00:15:14,380 --> 00:15:16,581
There were tulips from Netherlands,

278
00:15:16,582 --> 00:15:20,552
a quartet, everything that
you could ever dream of.

279
00:15:21,220 --> 00:15:24,657
And girl, especially, the ring.

280
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,026
Look at the ring!

281
00:15:27,092 --> 00:15:28,961
Look at the cut, the carat.

282
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:30,829
It’s emerald cut, girl!

283
00:15:30,896 --> 00:15:32,196
It’s so beautiful,

284
00:15:32,197 --> 00:15:33,899
a tear fell when I saw it.

285
00:15:34,300 --> 00:15:35,401
It is beautiful.

286
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,303
It feels-

287
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:39,438
Are you jealous?

288
00:15:40,072 --> 00:15:40,606
(chuckles)

289
00:15:40,906 --> 00:15:42,374
Don’t be jealous!

290
00:15:42,775 --> 00:15:45,644
I’m sure your time will come... with Zach!

291
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:47,379
Even bigger.

292
00:15:48,981 --> 00:15:50,249
What’s with the face?

293
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,051
Did you guys fight?

294
00:15:52,918 --> 00:15:54,319
I feel paranoid.

295
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:58,657
There’s this girl who’s
sending Zach her nudes.

296
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:00,592
Zach’s cheating?

297
00:16:00,926 --> 00:16:03,661
I mean, I saw their conversation,

298
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,596
Zach never responded to her.

299
00:16:05,597 --> 00:16:07,099
He only left the messages on read.

300
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:08,934
On read?

301
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:10,436
- Yeah.
- That’s it?

302
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,403
- Yeah.
- No harm!

303
00:16:12,404 --> 00:16:14,105
No foul!

304
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:17,476
And besides, Zach should
never pick a fight with you.

305
00:16:18,010 --> 00:16:19,311
And if he does,

306
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:21,780
he’ll be going against a lot of people.

307
00:16:36,295 --> 00:16:38,330
How amazing, this shines so brightly.

308
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:40,131
Yeah. Girl, it’s beautiful.

309
00:16:40,132 --> 00:16:40,833
Dear!

310
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:42,267
Hi!

311
00:16:42,268 --> 00:16:44,168
Hey, Pa.

312
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:46,138
Amelie, I see you have a visitor.

313
00:16:48,140 --> 00:16:49,008
Auntie Marga...

314
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:55,913
Amelie, tell our helpers
to serve some food, okay?

315
00:16:55,914 --> 00:16:57,549
Your sister doesn’t come here very often.

316
00:16:57,983 --> 00:17:00,719
Ah, Nova, please hand me my bag.

317
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,191
How much do you need?

318
00:17:07,192 --> 00:17:08,326
Ten?

319
00:17:08,327 --> 00:17:09,028
Twenty?

320
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:10,696
Twenty, ma’am?

321
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:12,064
- Twenty.
- Twenty.

322
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,302
I’m not here to ask for money.

323
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,171
I’m just here to visit Amelie.

324
00:17:19,471 --> 00:17:20,773
Are you sure?

325
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:22,674
You and your mother might need it.

326
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:25,943
Thanks anyway,

327
00:17:25,944 --> 00:17:30,783
but I have a good job at the pharma company.

328
00:17:31,550 --> 00:17:33,685
I’m actually up for a promotion.

329
00:17:33,952 --> 00:17:36,254
Oh. Really, dear?

330
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:37,356
Wow!

331
00:17:37,489 --> 00:17:39,091
Congrats, dear. Congrats, dear.

332
00:17:39,425 --> 00:17:40,159
You know...

333
00:17:40,225 --> 00:17:42,561
You really are exactly like your mother.

334
00:17:44,530 --> 00:17:45,763
Oh, my goodness.

335
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,733
We’re so proud of you, dear.

336
00:17:47,866 --> 00:17:50,269
You’re just exactly like your mother.

337
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:53,505
At least, the both of you will no longer
have to ask my husband for money.

338
00:17:54,106 --> 00:17:55,873
Let’s go, we’re running late.

339
00:17:55,874 --> 00:17:57,042
Bye, dear.

340
00:17:57,543 --> 00:17:58,510
(Kiss sound)

341
00:17:58,511 --> 00:17:59,711
Dear.

342
00:18:01,213 --> 00:18:02,247
Bye, Pa.

343
00:18:02,281 --> 00:18:02,915
Let’s go, honey

344
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:03,549
You guys take care.

345
00:18:03,615 --> 00:18:04,416
Bye.

346
00:18:08,387 --> 00:18:10,189
Marga said that?

347
00:18:11,123 --> 00:18:13,391
How about I pour paint
thinner all over her face?

348
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,594
She speaks as if she has been feeding us.

349
00:18:15,894 --> 00:18:17,529
Oh Mom, aren’t you used to it?

350
00:18:19,465 --> 00:18:23,235
I honestly don’t get what her
problem with us is.

351
00:18:23,535 --> 00:18:25,471
When I caught her and your dad,

352
00:18:25,637 --> 00:18:27,004
and I was pregnant with you back then,

353
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:28,841
they never heard anything from me.

354
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,441
I never went after them,

355
00:18:30,442 --> 00:18:31,476
I kept quiet,

356
00:18:31,477 --> 00:18:32,678
It wasn’t a problem to me.

357
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:35,247
They were happy,
and I stayed out of it.

358
00:18:35,414 --> 00:18:37,549
(Melancholic instrumental)

359
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,588
Mom,

360
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:48,927
did you ever think of
giving Pa another chance?

361
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,930
I no longer felt the need

362
00:18:52,264 --> 00:18:53,966
to fight for him.

363
00:18:54,166 --> 00:18:54,933
First of all,

364
00:18:54,934 --> 00:18:56,601
I was already satisfied with the life
I had back then,

365
00:18:56,602 --> 00:18:58,003
and I already had you.

366
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,105
If I were to have a husband

367
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,343
who’s just going to
bring me pain, forget it.

368
00:19:05,043 --> 00:19:07,179
Don’t you want a normal family?

369
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,186
Do you feel incomplete

370
00:19:14,686 --> 00:19:16,722
because you grew up
far away from your father?

371
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:17,823
(Tongue clicking)

372
00:19:17,824 --> 00:19:21,960
Well, sometimes that
thought crosses my mind, Mom.

373
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,633
Like, what if I grew up
with both my parents?

374
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,836
I bet that would've been so nice.

375
00:19:40,646 --> 00:19:42,548
I’m really sorry, dear.

376
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:45,082
That is something
I wasn’t able to give you.

377
00:19:45,083 --> 00:19:50,656
I thought sacrificing my life
for you would be enough.

378
00:19:52,658 --> 00:19:53,992
But I guess not.

379
00:20:03,635 --> 00:20:04,869
- I can’t see anything.
- We’re already here,

380
00:20:04,870 --> 00:20:06,037
- just a little more.
- I’m not kidding.

381
00:20:06,038 --> 00:20:07,738
I can’t see anything, Zach.

382
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,006
What’s this about?

383
00:20:09,007 --> 00:20:10,174
You’re not supposed to see anything.

384
00:20:10,175 --> 00:20:11,577
How many fingers am I holding up?

385
00:20:12,778 --> 00:20:14,178
- It’s already late
(Zach laughs)

386
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:15,013
We’re almost there

387
00:20:15,013 --> 00:20:15,881
Where are we headed?

388
00:20:15,882 --> 00:20:17,114
Watch your step, be careful.

389
00:20:17,115 --> 00:20:18,683
Wait, hold on.
I’m wearing heels.

390
00:20:18,684 --> 00:20:19,251
What now?

391
00:20:19,252 --> 00:20:20,484
Where should I face?
What should I do?

392
00:20:20,485 --> 00:20:22,186
- Ready?
- Okay, ready.

393
00:20:22,187 --> 00:20:24,523
And, surprise.

394
00:20:27,392 --> 00:20:30,696
- This is for you.
- Wow, really?

395
00:20:31,697 --> 00:20:33,130
You did all this?

396
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:34,099
Yeah.

397
00:20:34,100 --> 00:20:35,866
Well, little help from my friends.

398
00:20:35,867 --> 00:20:37,668
But yeah, I was the one
who conceptualized all this.

399
00:20:37,669 --> 00:20:40,439
But wait, our anniversary
is still two weeks from now.

400
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:44,675
I had to do all of this now
because if I did it on our anniversary,

401
00:20:44,676 --> 00:20:45,876
it wouldn’t be a surprise

402
00:20:45,877 --> 00:20:47,111
- since you’d already be expecting it.
- Wow.

403
00:20:47,112 --> 00:20:49,046
All the lights, in fairness to you,

404
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,148
I see the effort.

405
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,285
Thank you.

406
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:55,721
(Deep sigh)

407
00:20:56,688 --> 00:20:57,888
Okay, Wow.

408
00:20:57,889 --> 00:20:58,757
So, where do we start?

409
00:20:58,757 --> 00:20:59,725
Ah, okay!

410
00:21:01,059 --> 00:21:01,893
Here.

411
00:21:02,094 --> 00:21:04,896
I even ordered this from France.

412
00:21:09,534 --> 00:21:10,369
Okay.

413
00:21:15,941 --> 00:21:17,075
Are you okay?

414
00:21:19,144 --> 00:21:20,178
What’s wrong?

415
00:21:21,146 --> 00:21:22,581
You seem bothered.

416
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:24,716
You can tell me, love.

417
00:21:25,417 --> 00:21:28,387
(Crickets chirping)

418
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,589
I don’t have a problem with Mom.

419
00:21:30,756 --> 00:21:31,957
I’m just you know,

420
00:21:32,424 --> 00:21:36,194
I’m grateful for everything
she’s doing for me.

421
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,197
It’s just that I’m curious

422
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,334
on what my life would be like

423
00:21:43,101 --> 00:21:46,104
if I had a complete family.

424
00:21:46,772 --> 00:21:47,339
Aw.

425
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,141
Love.

426
00:21:50,876 --> 00:21:51,843
I get you.

427
00:21:51,844 --> 00:21:53,845
Really, I do.

428
00:21:54,112 --> 00:21:55,947
It’s completely normal to think about that.

429
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,950
Every person is always looking
for something that is missing.

430
00:21:59,951 --> 00:22:00,951
It’s normal.

431
00:22:00,952 --> 00:22:02,020
You’re okay.

432
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:03,622
You’re fine.

433
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:06,825
(Emotional music intensifies)

434
00:22:07,192 --> 00:22:08,293
(Sigh)

435
00:22:10,195 --> 00:22:12,831
If I were to have a child,

436
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,500
I would like my child to have
a mother and a father.

437
00:22:16,368 --> 00:22:19,538
I don’t want my child to
grow up feeling incomplete.

438
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:22,540
You already want to have a baby?

439
00:22:22,541 --> 00:22:23,875
Well, I'm good with that.

440
00:22:25,377 --> 00:22:26,545
(Scoffs)

441
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:28,246
C'mon. Let's just eat.

442
00:22:29,848 --> 00:22:31,383
Finish all your food.

443
00:22:32,150 --> 00:22:34,486
The food is really good,
in fairness to you.

444
00:22:36,922 --> 00:22:37,823
(Clears throat)
- Love,

445
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:44,663
what if I’m craving something?

446
00:22:46,665 --> 00:22:48,367
Someone else.

447
00:22:50,168 --> 00:22:52,036
(Suspenseful music)

448
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:53,505
Zach, I’m not ready.

449
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:55,340
It’s okay, love.

450
00:22:56,241 --> 00:22:57,241
Don’t resist.

451
00:22:57,242 --> 00:22:58,243
It will be fine.

452
00:23:00,078 --> 00:23:01,812
Yeah, but I’m not,

453
00:23:01,813 --> 00:23:02,647
I’m not ready.

454
00:23:02,648 --> 00:23:04,850
(Deep breath) (Grunts lightly)
- Stop playing hard to get, alright?

455
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:06,418
It will be fine.

456
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,919
Just relax, breathe.

457
00:23:08,920 --> 00:23:09,888
Zach, you’re hurting me

458
00:23:12,524 --> 00:23:13,724
Come here.

459
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:14,959
- No.
- Don’t run.

460
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:16,194
- Don’t run, Liv.
- No.

461
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,196
- Don’t run.
- Zach, I’m going home.

462
00:23:19,865 --> 00:23:21,133
Zach, stop!

463
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:23,034
Zach, please! Zach!

464
00:23:23,268 --> 00:23:24,603
Don’t run!

465
00:23:25,203 --> 00:23:27,072
(Grunts in frustration)

466
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,577
Come on!

467
00:23:36,615 --> 00:23:38,382
(Upbeat party music)

468
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:39,917
(Girls cheering)
- Oh my god, guys!

469
00:23:39,918 --> 00:23:41,385
Wait, it's not here yet.

470
00:23:41,386 --> 00:23:42,787
Let’s wait for my bestie first

471
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:43,755
before we have a toast,

472
00:23:43,756 --> 00:23:46,624
but I just wanna say
I’m so excited!

473
00:23:46,625 --> 00:23:47,592
Finally!

474
00:23:47,593 --> 00:23:48,794
She’s finally joining us.

475
00:23:49,394 --> 00:23:50,861
Oh my god, it’s here!

476
00:23:50,862 --> 00:23:52,063
Are you guys ready?

477
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:55,267
One, two-

478
00:23:58,103 --> 00:23:59,271
I’m gonna get it ready.

479
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:00,971
Let’s go, girls!

480
00:24:00,972 --> 00:24:03,974
(Screaming in excitement) (laughing)

481
00:24:03,975 --> 00:24:05,242
Bestie!

482
00:24:05,243 --> 00:24:08,313
- Over here! Hello!
- Hey!

483
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:09,981
Champagne, I see.

484
00:24:09,982 --> 00:24:12,583
- Hi, girl!
- Of course, life is better with sparkles.

485
00:24:12,584 --> 00:24:15,553
But, first of, I wanna introduce you
to my law school friends.

486
00:24:15,554 --> 00:24:16,455
This is Bea!

487
00:24:16,455 --> 00:24:17,355
- Bea
- Hi!

488
00:24:17,355 --> 00:24:18,323
Hi, I’m Liv.

489
00:24:18,323 --> 00:24:19,291
- This is Trish.
- Liv.

490
00:24:19,292 --> 00:24:21,592
And my bestie, Liv!

491
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,593
So pretty!

492
00:24:22,594 --> 00:24:23,994
We’re making the most out
of everything right now.

493
00:24:23,995 --> 00:24:27,097
I will no longer be able to drink
once I get back to law school,

494
00:24:27,098 --> 00:24:28,966
so let’s have fun and let’s celebrate!

495
00:24:28,967 --> 00:24:30,267
And because of that,

496
00:24:30,268 --> 00:24:31,836
here you go, my treat.

497
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,905
- Wow!
- Well, it’s dad’s treat.

498
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:36,441
But, you know what I mean.
(Yana laughs)

499
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,776
Thank you.

500
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:39,643
You know what?

501
00:24:39,644 --> 00:24:41,779
You don't have a glass.

502
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,913
Well, this is mine.

503
00:24:42,914 --> 00:24:44,181
The whole bottle is mine.

504
00:24:44,182 --> 00:24:45,382
My gosh, bestie!

505
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:47,285
I don’t get to do this everyday!

506
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:49,787
- Cheers, girls! Cheers!
(Phone ringing)

507
00:24:49,788 --> 00:24:51,590
- Hold on.
(Glasses clinking)

508
00:24:57,662 --> 00:25:01,933
I saw Zach’s story, the one he posted.

509
00:25:02,234 --> 00:25:05,704
So cute! You guys celebrated in advance?

510
00:25:10,809 --> 00:25:13,178
But why are you ignoring his calls?

511
00:25:15,680 --> 00:25:17,014
Well...

512
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:18,149
Are you guys fighting?

513
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:20,519
Are you guys okay?

514
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,256
Bestie, is team Liv-Zach over?

515
00:25:25,790 --> 00:25:28,894
Well, I think I just
need space to think.

516
00:25:30,996 --> 00:25:32,897
It just seems like we have
different needs

517
00:25:32,898 --> 00:25:34,332
when it comes to having a relationship.

518
00:25:35,066 --> 00:25:36,535
Oh, no.

519
00:25:38,503 --> 00:25:39,437
You know what?

520
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,072
It’s okay.

521
00:25:41,073 --> 00:25:42,339
We’re here to have fun.

522
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:43,874
Let’s not think about that first,

523
00:25:43,875 --> 00:25:45,710
let’s distract each other,

524
00:25:46,077 --> 00:25:47,645
let’s have fun!

525
00:25:47,646 --> 00:25:48,580
Okay?

526
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:50,982
Come on guys, let’s have fun!

527
00:25:51,516 --> 00:25:53,017
Oh my god!

528
00:25:53,018 --> 00:25:55,053
Mister waiter no longer bothered
to bring me a glass!

529
00:26:10,068 --> 00:26:11,536
(Car door thuds)

530
00:26:16,474 --> 00:26:18,109
It’s a good thing you
finally came home.

531
00:26:19,010 --> 00:26:20,045
What are you doing here?

532
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:21,379
Why are you here?

533
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:23,415
I wanted to apologize to you,

534
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:27,052
but it seems like I’m the only
one affected here.

535
00:26:30,622 --> 00:26:32,724
Look at you, you’re extremely drunk.
You even went out to party.

536
00:26:32,924 --> 00:26:34,426
Where were you exactly? Huh?

537
00:26:34,793 --> 00:26:36,393
You have not been replying
to any of my messages.

538
00:26:36,394 --> 00:26:37,796
You don't answer my calls either.

539
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:39,898
I was with Yana.

540
00:26:40,465 --> 00:26:41,766
I don't care.

541
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:44,235
Babe, I’m your boyfriend, right?

542
00:26:45,904 --> 00:26:47,505
I’m your priority.

543
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:52,143
It has always been like that, right?

544
00:26:56,247 --> 00:26:58,917
I’m your boyfriend,
and I’m your priority, right?!

545
00:27:04,823 --> 00:27:06,523
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

546
00:27:06,524 --> 00:27:07,726
I’m sorry!

547
00:27:08,426 --> 00:27:09,794
- I’m sorry, babe.
- Don’t touch me.

548
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,096
I’m sorry.

549
00:27:11,496 --> 00:27:13,298
I don’t want to argue with you.

550
00:27:14,199 --> 00:27:16,067
Don’t you dare turn your back on me.

551
00:27:16,368 --> 00:27:18,136
I’m still not done talking to you.

552
00:27:22,774 --> 00:27:23,642
Okay.

553
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:27,278
I...

554
00:27:29,114 --> 00:27:30,382
I think we need some time off.

555
00:27:31,616 --> 00:27:32,784
Time off?

556
00:27:33,451 --> 00:27:35,120
You don’t want me anymore?

557
00:27:35,320 --> 00:27:36,621
Are you breaking up with me?

558
00:27:37,288 --> 00:27:38,323
Don’t break up with me.

559
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:39,290
I’m sorry,

560
00:27:39,291 --> 00:27:40,792
I’m sorry if I hurt you.

561
00:27:42,127 --> 00:27:43,294
Liv, please.

562
00:27:43,995 --> 00:27:44,796
No.

563
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,564
It’s not like that,

564
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:48,333
it’s nothing like that.

565
00:27:50,535 --> 00:27:52,404
I just need some space, okay?

566
00:27:54,472 --> 00:27:58,043
Look at this, look at us,
we’re constantly fighting.

567
00:27:58,476 --> 00:28:01,012
No, this is not healthy.

568
00:28:01,212 --> 00:28:02,147
Are you for real?

569
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:04,181
Is this how it’s gonna be?!

570
00:28:04,182 --> 00:28:05,984
Does everything depend
on your mood now?!

571
00:28:06,117 --> 00:28:08,019
Our relationship depends on your mood?

572
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:09,954
Do you think I’m a toy
you can just play with?!

573
00:28:10,121 --> 00:28:11,523
Is that it, Liv?!

574
00:28:12,691 --> 00:28:14,793
Love. I mean...

575
00:28:16,394 --> 00:28:17,495
Zach.

576
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:20,598
Zach.

577
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:22,500
Zach.

578
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,337
Just relax, okay?

579
00:28:30,842 --> 00:28:33,178
We just need some time and space, that’s it.

580
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,717
That’s all I’m asking you for,

581
00:28:39,684 --> 00:28:41,186
please understand.

582
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:51,362
Let’s first figure out what
we really want in life, okay?

583
00:29:00,438 --> 00:29:01,706
Liv.

584
00:29:03,842 --> 00:29:04,776
Liv!

585
00:29:04,777 --> 00:29:07,712
(Sniffles)

586
00:29:21,559 --> 00:29:24,095
Hey, that might seek revenge.

587
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:31,870
Liv, aren’t you afraid that
Coach Zach might hurt you?

588
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:33,772
Why would he hurt me?

589
00:29:34,038 --> 00:29:34,973
You said it yourself,

590
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:37,908
he didn’t take the whole
cool off idea very well.

591
00:29:37,909 --> 00:29:46,484
I noticed Coach Zach seems...
controlling and possessive.

592
00:29:46,684 --> 00:29:49,153
People like that have a tendency to be
aggressive when

593
00:29:49,154 --> 00:29:51,356
they don’t get what they want, right?

594
00:29:52,257 --> 00:29:53,958
Do you have an ex boyfriend who’s like that?

595
00:29:53,992 --> 00:29:56,961
Not an ex, but my brother.

596
00:29:57,262 --> 00:30:01,166
He came across someone
who’s exactly like that.

597
00:30:02,934 --> 00:30:04,903
Good thing my brother is a fighter.

598
00:30:06,938 --> 00:30:08,540
He won’t allow anyone to step over him.

599
00:30:10,175 --> 00:30:12,777
He always fights for
what he thinks is right.

600
00:30:13,344 --> 00:30:14,913
What happened to your brother then?

601
00:30:16,915 --> 00:30:18,516
(Gate squeaking)

602
00:30:22,520 --> 00:30:23,554
Dear.

603
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:24,522
Oh, Pa!

604
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:26,457
Hi.

605
00:30:29,194 --> 00:30:29,928
Hi.

606
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:31,296
Hello.

607
00:30:31,297 --> 00:30:33,163
- Sorry, I still have these gloves on.
- Sorry, sorry.

608
00:30:33,164 --> 00:30:36,467
I brought you guys some fruits from the farm.

609
00:30:36,634 --> 00:30:37,701
Oh, thank you

610
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,871
Oh, by the way, this is Sugar.

611
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:40,572
Hello.

612
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:42,339
- Hi.
- Sugar, this is my dad.

613
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:43,340
She’s our new boarder.

614
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:44,374
Oh.

615
00:30:44,375 --> 00:30:45,676
He’s your dad?

616
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:47,145
You look young!

617
00:30:47,478 --> 00:30:48,813
- Wow!
- Thank you.

618
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:51,382
That explains why he’s a womanizer.

619
00:30:52,750 --> 00:30:53,718
Sorry.

620
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:55,987
Sorry, sorry.

621
00:30:56,187 --> 00:30:58,823
I’ll bring the fruits inside.

622
00:30:59,390 --> 00:31:01,359
- Slow down, it’s heavy.
- I can manage.

623
00:31:05,129 --> 00:31:06,865
I’m sorry about Sugar,

624
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,734
she can be tactless sometimes,

625
00:31:11,169 --> 00:31:13,571
but she’s a nice person.

626
00:31:14,672 --> 00:31:16,207
What she said was true, anyway.

627
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:18,509
It’s okay.

628
00:31:19,177 --> 00:31:22,180
It’s a good thing you take
after your mother.

629
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:26,618
Your entire life, she was like your
mother and father already.

630
00:31:28,419 --> 00:31:34,058
(Phone ringing)

631
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:45,336
Pa, why did you give up on Mom before?

632
00:31:47,071 --> 00:31:50,408
Back when you cheated on her.

633
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:52,609
Why didn’t you try to win her back?

634
00:31:52,610 --> 00:31:54,245
I tried several times.

635
00:31:56,214 --> 00:32:00,018
But she couldn't trust me anymore

636
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,821
Your mom can be stubborn sometimes.

637
00:32:04,789 --> 00:32:06,057
If she’s done with something,

638
00:32:06,557 --> 00:32:07,891
she’ll no longer look back,

639
00:32:07,892 --> 00:32:09,427
nothing can stop her.

640
00:32:10,194 --> 00:32:12,563
So, we moved on separately.

641
00:32:19,804 --> 00:32:23,775
Dear, I just hope you don’t end up like your mother.

642
00:32:24,509 --> 00:32:28,980
Learn to forgive.
Everyone makes mistakes.

643
00:32:29,747 --> 00:32:32,050
You just have to figure out which
is more valuable to you;

644
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:36,254
your pride, or your loved one.

645
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:39,590
Zach?

646
00:32:41,426 --> 00:32:42,327
Zach?

647
00:32:43,828 --> 00:32:46,764
(Suspenseful music)

648
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,167
(Girl moans)

649
00:32:50,168 --> 00:32:51,702
(Laughs and giggles)
- Yeah! Yeah!

650
00:32:51,703 --> 00:32:52,837
Yes!

651
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,807
Tell me you want it.

652
00:32:55,808 --> 00:32:57,475
I want more.

653
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:00,345
(Zach moans) Alright.

654
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:05,183
Zach, is that you?

655
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:11,356
(Suspenseful music intensifies)

656
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:12,824
Oh my gosh.

657
00:33:12,825 --> 00:33:14,358
I’m sorry, I’m sorry.

658
00:33:14,359 --> 00:33:16,027
(Slams)

659
00:33:18,296 --> 00:33:20,198
No, no, no, no!

660
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,267
Really? Really?

661
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,370
(Stammering)
- What are you doing here, Liv?

662
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:26,471
Huh?

663
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:28,473
It really is your cheat day, isn’t it?

664
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:30,107
That one time in the week

665
00:33:30,108 --> 00:33:33,177
that you’re allowed to
taste anything that’s unhealthy.

666
00:33:33,511 --> 00:33:37,382
Sugar, carbs, or even another woman!

667
00:33:38,383 --> 00:33:39,650
What’s your problem?

668
00:33:41,052 --> 00:33:42,986
Didn’t we decide to take a break?

669
00:33:42,987 --> 00:33:45,856
There’s nothing wrong with this.
Why are you being dramatic, Liv?

670
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:46,657
Why?

671
00:33:46,658 --> 00:33:49,293
I was just gone for a while,
you've already replaced me?!

672
00:33:49,894 --> 00:33:50,828
Her?

673
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:51,996
Her?

674
00:33:51,997 --> 00:33:53,330
Her over you?

675
00:33:53,331 --> 00:33:55,366
That was just for fun, okay?

676
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,168
Let me make things clear again.

677
00:33:58,169 --> 00:33:59,704
Didn’t we decide to take a break?

678
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:01,605
That means this is okay, right?

679
00:34:01,606 --> 00:34:03,006
So what seems to be the problem?

680
00:34:03,007 --> 00:34:03,908
What is it, Liv, baby?

681
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:06,209
I said I needed space to think.

682
00:34:06,210 --> 00:34:08,011
I never said you should
replace me with someone else.

683
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:08,846
Baby.

684
00:34:09,347 --> 00:34:10,615
Baby, that was just playtime.

685
00:34:10,715 --> 00:34:11,315
Please!

686
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,518
Me choosing her over you?!

687
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:14,352
My god.

688
00:34:14,419 --> 00:34:16,754
Baby, c'mon.

689
00:34:17,688 --> 00:34:20,191
Of course I have needs, okay?

690
00:34:20,558 --> 00:34:23,261
I was just using her to
get what you can’t give,

691
00:34:23,361 --> 00:34:25,930
and that’s it, nothing more.

692
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:28,933
Do that again.

693
00:34:30,868 --> 00:34:32,103
That’s it? That’s all you’ve got?

694
00:34:34,872 --> 00:34:35,807
That’s the best you can do?

695
00:34:37,875 --> 00:34:38,943
You’re disgusting.

696
00:34:39,043 --> 00:34:40,544
- One more time, I dare you.
- You disgust me!

697
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,978
(Struggling / Groans in pain)
- Stop, Liv!

698
00:34:41,979 --> 00:34:43,381
Can you stop it?!

699
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:47,452
- Enough!
- Don’t you dare hurt me again!

700
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:54,559
Liv, did you really think that
you’re that special?

701
00:34:55,827 --> 00:34:56,828
Huh?!

702
00:34:57,662 --> 00:34:59,362
That’s enough!
You’re hurting me, let go of me.

703
00:34:59,363 --> 00:35:00,731
I don’t care!

704
00:35:00,832 --> 00:35:02,834
- Let go of me.
- You’re not special, Liv!

705
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,937
Did you really think that
I would be loyal to you?!

706
00:35:06,938 --> 00:35:08,538
(Sobbing) Let go of me.

707
00:35:08,539 --> 00:35:11,909
That I would wait around after
you slammed your gate at me?!

708
00:35:12,376 --> 00:35:14,545
(Sobbing) Let go of me!

709
00:35:14,979 --> 00:35:16,681
Baby, you’re not that special.

710
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:18,616
(Groans)

711
00:35:18,616 --> 00:35:19,383
No!

712
00:35:19,384 --> 00:35:21,318
You’re not special, okay?

713
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:24,388
In fact, you’re boring.

714
00:35:26,124 --> 00:35:27,024
You know what, Liv?

715
00:35:27,025 --> 00:35:30,027
I'm not even surprised
that your dad left you,

716
00:35:31,629 --> 00:35:33,029
because you’re boring.

717
00:35:33,030 --> 00:35:35,800
(Liv sobs and sniffles)

718
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:39,804
Let me go, let go of me.

719
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:41,472
We’re over.

720
00:35:42,440 --> 00:35:43,841
We’re over!

721
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:46,010
(Sniffles)

722
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:50,280
Come back here!

723
00:35:50,281 --> 00:35:51,982
(Camera shutter)
(Fire rustling)

724
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:55,887
(Zach screaming in agony)

725
00:35:56,988 --> 00:36:00,958
Just find whoever did this to Zach.

726
00:36:04,996 --> 00:36:07,064
She must pay for her sins.

727
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,699
“She”?

728
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:14,472
So you think a woman
did this to Zach?

729
00:36:14,906 --> 00:36:16,039
(Suspenseful music intensifies)

730
00:36:16,040 --> 00:36:20,845
(Stutters, sobs, and sniffles)

731
00:36:20,978 --> 00:36:21,512
Or...

732
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:25,816
Or a guy! I...

733
00:36:26,984 --> 00:36:29,353
I-... I don't care!

734
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:36,359
Gender... gender, doesn’t matter.

735
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,729
I couldn’t care less
if it’s a girl or a boy.

736
00:36:39,697 --> 00:36:43,701
Just, just find whoever
did this to him, please.

737
00:36:47,038 --> 00:36:48,906
Please, inspector.

738
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:53,911
Crime doesn’t discriminate

739
00:36:54,412 --> 00:36:56,514
and neither should justice.

740
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:04,355
(sniffling)

741
00:37:05,089 --> 00:37:06,591
(Fire crackling)

742
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:08,693
Relax, who are you arguing with?

743
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,928
That damned coach is
exploiting me for his agenda.

744
00:37:11,128 --> 00:37:12,330
I'll kill him!

745
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:15,233
He suffered a heart attack while working out.

746
00:37:16,067 --> 00:37:19,003
The weights he was holding slipped from his hands.

747
00:37:19,303 --> 00:37:20,771
I finally found our new chef.

748
00:37:21,606 --> 00:37:22,673
Meet Sugar Alvarez.

749
00:37:23,007 --> 00:37:24,375
Sugar... Alvarez.

750
00:37:24,475 --> 00:37:25,543
Nice to meet you coach.

751
00:37:26,677 --> 00:37:28,913
I knew someone named Alvarez too.

752
00:37:29,146 --> 00:37:30,848
Sugar, what did he say?

753
00:37:30,915 --> 00:37:32,083
Tell us what he said now!

754
00:37:32,750 --> 00:37:33,451
Who's next?
