anything you say
can and will be used

363
00:20:44,034 --> 00:20:44,993
[INSPECTOR KIRBY]
against you in a court of law.

[INSPECTOR GEORGIA]
I'm sorry,

366
00:20:47,162 --> 00:20:51,083
but we have a warrant of arrest
for Miss Amelie Baltazar.

367
00:20:51,458 --> 00:20:53,292
You're under arrest, Miss Alvarez,

368
00:20:53,293 --> 00:20:54,878
in the murder of Zach Zamora.

369
00:20:55,045 --> 00:20:56,505
Why? Hold on.
