00:00:00,333 --> 00:00:08,800
(Gemini by Julie Anne San Jose Playing)

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:12,679
(Zach screaming in agony)

3
00:00:12,887 --> 00:00:16,099
[LIV] No! No!

4
00:00:16,182 --> 00:00:19,144
I'm inspector Juro Catapang, lead investigator in this case.

5
00:00:19,227 --> 00:00:20,228
I need your statement.

6
00:00:20,478 --> 00:00:21,604
Zach, I'm not ready.

7
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:23,356
Don't resist, it'll be fine.

8
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:24,649
Zach, please!

9
00:00:24,774 --> 00:00:25,233
Zach!

10
00:00:25,233 --> 00:00:26,109
Don't run!

11
00:00:26,609 --> 00:00:28,235
Is Team Liv-Zach over?!

12
00:00:28,236 --> 00:00:30,864
Oh, I think I just need space to think.

13
00:00:31,114 --> 00:00:34,284
It seems like we have
different needs in a relationship.

14
00:00:34,367 --> 00:00:36,661
Dear, I hope you don't end up like your mom.

15
00:00:36,745 --> 00:00:37,829
Learn how to forgive.

16
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:39,456
We all make mistakes.

17
00:00:39,622 --> 00:00:40,749
Zach, is that you?

18
00:00:41,791 --> 00:00:43,126
No, no, no!

19
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:44,961
Stop it!

20
00:00:45,503 --> 00:00:46,421
We're over!

21
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:48,631
She must pay for her sins.

22
00:00:48,882 --> 00:00:51,217
So you think a woman did this to Zach?

23
00:00:51,593 --> 00:00:54,179
Girl or a guy! I don't care!

24
00:00:54,262 --> 00:00:57,891
Just find whoever did this to him, please.

25
00:00:58,016 --> 00:00:59,142
(sniffling)

26
00:00:59,267 --> 00:01:04,272
(Theme song playing)

27
00:01:42,352 --> 00:01:45,396
(Suspenseful music playing)

28
00:02:08,795 --> 00:02:10,338
I just want one thing

29
00:02:11,714 --> 00:02:16,177
to find out how and why
Zach Zamora burst into flames.

30
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,445
Sir...

31
00:02:35,738 --> 00:02:39,242
I'm used to cooking food over fire,

32
00:02:39,617 --> 00:02:40,785
not people.

33
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:47,167
Whoever did this to Coach wanted him tosuffer.

34
00:02:50,211 --> 00:02:50,879
(Grunts)

35
00:02:51,796 --> 00:02:53,506
[SUGAR] Drink some water first!
[Byron grunts]

36
00:02:54,549 --> 00:02:56,216
Hey, that’s too much—too much!

37
00:02:56,217 --> 00:02:57,260
Relax!

38
00:02:57,427 --> 00:02:59,512
What I said really worked.

39
00:02:59,762 --> 00:03:01,013
When I mentioned it was Coach Zach,

40
00:03:01,014 --> 00:03:02,514
your anger just came rushing out.

41
00:03:02,515 --> 00:03:05,518
(Laughs)

42
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:06,394
Hey.

43
00:03:06,394 --> 00:03:07,103
Just a moment.

44
00:03:07,562 --> 00:03:09,022
Breathe!

45
00:03:09,439 --> 00:03:11,816
In fairness, it was effective.

46
00:03:12,233 --> 00:03:13,776
- It helped.
- Told you.

47
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,613
I can’t help it.

48
00:03:17,739 --> 00:03:20,491
I think signing a contract with him was a bad move.

49
00:03:21,826 --> 00:03:23,286
He's only nice at first.

50
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:26,706
He'll gain your trust, and once he has you by the neck,

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:29,083
he will treat you like an animal.

52
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:32,712
Frustrated much?

53
00:03:33,379 --> 00:03:38,343
Why did you agree to be managed
by that Coach Zach anyway?

54
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,220
How worthless.

55
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:42,347
He was popular.

56
00:03:44,057 --> 00:03:45,683
Come to think of it,

57
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:48,853
he was a popular varsity player back in college.

58
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,313
He also has his own gym.

59
00:03:50,396 --> 00:03:50,939
Whatever.

60
00:03:50,940 --> 00:03:53,775
Forget about that Coach Zach,
stop dwelling on him!

61
00:03:54,525 --> 00:03:55,568
Byron, listen to me.

62
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:58,404
You need to give it your all.

63
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:02,242
Once you win that fight, you'll be famous.

64
00:04:02,909 --> 00:04:05,954
And you'll get rich too, right?

65
00:04:06,996 --> 00:04:11,125
Byron Alvarez, MMA Champion.

66
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,627
And of course, I'll be rich too once you're rich!

67
00:04:13,628 --> 00:04:14,795
- Oh, of course!
- There we go, perfect.

68
00:04:14,796 --> 00:04:18,215
Our plan to put up a restobar will soon come true.

69
00:04:18,216 --> 00:04:19,341
It's nice to dream.

70
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,593
It's not a dream!

71
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,887
It's our future!

72
00:04:23,137 --> 00:04:24,846
Tell me, do you want Mom and Dad to get rich?

73
00:04:24,847 --> 00:04:25,390
Of course.

74
00:04:25,431 --> 00:04:25,932
Including Kiko?

75
00:04:26,099 --> 00:04:26,516
Yes.

76
00:04:26,557 --> 00:04:27,016
Me?

77
00:04:27,141 --> 00:04:28,392
Definitely, especially you, of course!

78
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:29,644
Well, you better start training then.
Shape up!

79
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:30,979
Faster, I'll take a video of you.

80
00:04:31,104 --> 00:04:31,396
Okay.

81
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,480
Faster!

82
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:33,564
There you go.

83
00:04:33,606 --> 00:04:34,983
This is for your social media post!

84
00:04:35,066 --> 00:04:35,358
(Shushing)

85
00:04:38,236 --> 00:04:39,654
One, two, three...

86
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:39,946
Hey!

87
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:42,364
Surprise!

88
00:04:42,365 --> 00:04:45,034
(Cheering)

89
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:48,621
What's the occasion?

90
00:04:49,289 --> 00:04:50,498
Look at your mom.

91
00:04:51,457 --> 00:04:54,544
You guys haven't left yet, but she's already sad.

92
00:04:54,836 --> 00:04:55,420
Stop!

93
00:04:55,837 --> 00:04:56,587
(Laughing)

94
00:04:56,713 --> 00:05:01,509
Well, I’m just not used to
having the both of them gone.

95
00:05:01,884 --> 00:05:02,635
I see.

96
00:05:02,636 --> 00:05:04,387
- Mom's being dramatic, right?
- I agree.

97
00:05:04,512 --> 00:05:06,346
Mom, I will only be having my training in Manila.

98
00:05:06,347 --> 00:05:06,931
(Sugar giggles)

99
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:09,058
Sugar's the one who's going far away.

100
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,560
She's going to Bali, Indonesia.

101
00:05:10,685 --> 00:05:12,312
Stop it, Byron.

102
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:16,649
Mom, I'll only be gone for 6 months.

103
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,402
I'm only going to look for a foreigner.

104
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,611
(Whooing)

105
00:05:21,612 --> 00:05:22,405
How surprising!

106
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:24,615
I’ve been meaning to give you this.

107
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,826
One for you, and one for us.

108
00:05:27,618 --> 00:05:29,078
It’s important that you take care of it, okay?

109
00:05:29,579 --> 00:05:31,914
If you ever start missing us,

110
00:05:32,206 --> 00:05:34,542
just look at it, and it’ll feel like
we’re right there with you.

111
00:05:34,709 --> 00:05:35,084
Wow.

112
00:05:38,963 --> 00:05:40,882
Alright, thank you.

113
00:05:41,257 --> 00:05:41,758
(Giggles)

114
00:05:43,509 --> 00:05:44,802
Come on, let's eat!

115
00:05:44,969 --> 00:05:46,929
(Everyone chattering)

116
00:05:50,767 --> 00:05:52,685
Miss Philippines, can you move faster? Please.

117
00:05:52,727 --> 00:05:54,062
Yes, sir. Yes!

118
00:05:55,438 --> 00:05:56,147
Sugar?

119
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:56,939
What is it, ma’am?

120
00:05:56,981 --> 00:05:58,566
Finish that already.
Yes.

121
00:05:59,067 --> 00:05:59,484
Okay.

122
00:05:59,942 --> 00:06:02,028
Alright, ma’am. Thank you.

123
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:13,206
(Phone ringing)

124
00:06:13,623 --> 00:06:17,125
Byron! Good day from Bali!

125
00:06:17,126 --> 00:06:18,211
How are you doing there?

126
00:06:18,586 --> 00:06:19,921
I'm going to kill him!

127
00:06:20,046 --> 00:06:21,339
I'm going to beat him up!

128
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:22,631
Hey, calm down. What happened?

129
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,549
Who did you fight with?

130
00:06:23,591 --> 00:06:25,468
That monstrous coach is clearly biased.

131
00:06:27,428 --> 00:06:28,471
He left me out of the lineup

132
00:06:28,513 --> 00:06:30,098
just because I refused to take steroids.

133
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:32,266
Byron, don’t you ever take steroids, alright?

134
00:06:32,767 --> 00:06:33,892
That’s harmful to your body.

135
00:06:33,893 --> 00:06:35,144
Never… never take them.

136
00:06:35,186 --> 00:06:36,604
He says he’s going to choose someone else.

137
00:06:36,771 --> 00:06:37,897
Someone who knows how to follow orders.

138
00:06:37,980 --> 00:06:38,898
Just leave instead.

139
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,150
Look for another management team.

140
00:06:41,609 --> 00:06:42,902
But my hands are tied!

141
00:06:44,404 --> 00:06:45,863
I'm bound by my contract.

142
00:06:47,281 --> 00:06:48,574
I won't be able to compete as well.

143
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,327
He will destroy me in the MMA community.

144
00:06:52,245 --> 00:06:53,955
Sugar, I could lose my career.

145
00:06:54,497 --> 00:06:55,373
Byron, just leave already.

146
00:06:55,374 --> 00:06:56,666
Go back to our house instead.

147
00:06:57,125 --> 00:06:58,126
What about the restaurant?

148
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:00,128
What about our dreams?

149
00:07:00,753 --> 00:07:02,255
Leave it to me.

150
00:07:02,755 --> 00:07:06,175
I'll work harder here so we can save more.

151
00:07:06,426 --> 00:07:07,635
You're going to leave, alright?

152
00:07:08,136 --> 00:07:10,221
Bye now, I still have to work.

153
00:07:11,764 --> 00:07:12,515
Bye

154
00:07:24,652 --> 00:07:32,285
(Phone ringing)

155
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,787
Mom, I'll just call you later.

156
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,290
I'm still at work.

157
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:38,249
Dear.

158
00:07:38,541 --> 00:07:39,792
Dear, please come home.

159
00:07:42,128 --> 00:07:43,171
Are you crying?

160
00:07:44,464 --> 00:07:46,007
Your brother is gone...

161
00:07:46,090 --> 00:07:47,758
it's Byron...

162
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,552
your brother is dead.

163
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,722
He's already dead.

164
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,015
Ma'am?

165
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,184
Ma'am, can I talk to you?

166
00:07:57,059 --> 00:07:58,311
Why? What's wrong?

167
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,439
Something happened to my brother.

168
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:02,523
I have to go home.

169
00:08:02,773 --> 00:08:03,858
Are you sure about that?

170
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,695
- Yes.
- You went through a lot just to get here, remember?

171
00:08:07,737 --> 00:08:09,614
And now you're leaving all of a sudden?

172
00:08:11,365 --> 00:08:14,577
Sugar, if you leave now.

173
00:08:15,328 --> 00:08:16,412
You cannot return anymore.

174
00:08:17,246 --> 00:08:20,708
You won't be able to get your full salary as well.

175
00:08:23,169 --> 00:08:24,669
I want to see my brother.

176
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:25,796
I'm going home.

177
00:08:26,589 --> 00:08:29,049
I'm sorry, but I have to go home, ma'am.

178
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:30,301
I'm sorry.

179
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:32,720
I'm really sorry, I'm sorry.

180
00:08:32,887 --> 00:08:34,013
I'm sorry.

181
00:08:34,263 --> 00:08:36,182
(Sobbing)

182
00:08:37,975 --> 00:08:40,937
He had a heart attack while working out.

183
00:08:41,646 --> 00:08:44,357
The weights slipped from his hands while he was lifting it.

184
00:08:47,652 --> 00:08:48,444
Steroids.

185
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,989
They said that was the reason
why he had a heart attack.

186
00:09:12,802 --> 00:09:14,095
This can't be.

187
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:16,347
Mom, open it.

188
00:09:16,472 --> 00:09:18,349
Open it, Mom.

189
00:09:18,432 --> 00:09:20,141
I want to see him.

190
00:09:20,142 --> 00:09:21,561
Open it, please.

191
00:09:22,061 --> 00:09:24,479
Please, open it. I'm begging you.

192
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,814
Mom, open it.

193
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,191
No my dear.

194
00:09:27,233 --> 00:09:32,530
(Crying in despair)

195
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:00,933
Again, my condolences.

196
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,103
I would also like to let you know that

197
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:05,646
I already have an update.

198
00:10:06,063 --> 00:10:10,151
Do you want me to wait for Sugar before...

199
00:10:11,527 --> 00:10:12,945
Were you able to talk to Coach Zach?

200
00:10:13,321 --> 00:10:17,366
He denies encouraging the use of
steroids in his program.

201
00:10:18,576 --> 00:10:20,536
No... he's lying.

202
00:10:21,829 --> 00:10:24,999
He's been pressuring his trainees to take steroids.

203
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:27,001
There’s no solid evidence.

204
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:28,085
One more thing...

205
00:10:28,252 --> 00:10:29,337
Byron is strong.

206
00:10:29,378 --> 00:10:33,049
He wouldn’t be pressured into taking it, unless...

207
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:34,550
What are you trying to say, attorney?

208
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,595
That my brother took steroids on his own?

209
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,139
According to witnesses,

210
00:10:40,222 --> 00:10:42,683
he was desperate to win the championship,

211
00:10:42,725 --> 00:10:45,311
and he would do anything and everything.

212
00:10:45,436 --> 00:10:46,896
My brother is a good fighter!

213
00:10:47,229 --> 00:10:50,066
He doesn't have to take steroids to win!

214
00:10:51,192 --> 00:10:53,277
He was pressured into taking it
because he was being threatened!

215
00:10:53,402 --> 00:10:53,778
Dear...

216
00:10:53,861 --> 00:10:55,488
Have that coach investigated!

217
00:10:55,529 --> 00:10:59,283
I'm telling you, he's the reason why my brother died!

218
00:10:59,533 --> 00:11:03,287
Even the police have already ruled
out the angle of foul play.

219
00:11:06,123 --> 00:11:10,418
The investigation on this case will be discontinued.

220
00:11:10,419 --> 00:11:11,836
(Sugar whimpers)

221
00:11:11,837 --> 00:11:13,756
Your brother died in an accident.

222
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:16,467
So, now my son is the one at fault here?!

223
00:11:19,261 --> 00:11:20,054
I'm sorry.

224
00:11:20,346 --> 00:11:21,013
I'm sorry.

225
00:11:25,017 --> 00:11:26,811
It’s a good thing she finally left.

226
00:11:27,186 --> 00:11:27,687
(Sugar's mom sobbing)

227
00:11:30,606 --> 00:11:31,190
(Sugar sobbing)

228
00:11:34,235 --> 00:11:35,444
This is all my fault.

229
00:11:37,571 --> 00:11:41,200
Dear, it's not your fault.

230
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:44,662
No.

231
00:11:47,748 --> 00:11:52,503
Byron couldn't leave his career because of our plans.

232
00:11:54,380 --> 00:11:56,757
He didn't want me to extend in Bali anymore.

233
00:11:57,717 --> 00:11:58,134
That's why...

234
00:11:58,426 --> 00:12:00,803
that's why even if he knew that it was dangerous,

235
00:12:00,845 --> 00:12:03,305
he still chose to stay with that Coach Zach.

236
00:12:03,973 --> 00:12:05,516
Sugar, no one is blaming you.

237
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,769
Mom, I'll make it up to all of you.

238
00:12:11,355 --> 00:12:13,149
I will make Coach Zach pay.

239
00:12:19,447 --> 00:12:19,989
Zach!

240
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,491
Yo, I finally found our new chef!

241
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,412
Hopefully, she'll stay longer here than our previous one.

242
00:12:27,163 --> 00:12:28,122
Meet Sugar Alvarez.

243
00:12:30,875 --> 00:12:32,501
Sugar... Alvarez?

244
00:12:33,335 --> 00:12:34,462
Nice to meet you, coach.

245
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,882
I knew someone named Alvarez.

246
00:12:39,550 --> 00:12:43,012
Too bad for that guy—he had potential,

247
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:45,681
but he’s too stubborn and didn't listen.

248
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:49,185
Maybe you know him? Byron Alvarez?

249
00:12:52,313 --> 00:12:55,649
But all the Alvarezes I know are fighters.

250
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,360
I can even do what you're doing.

251
00:12:59,028 --> 00:13:01,071
It's so easy, I used to do that back in the province.

252
00:13:02,156 --> 00:13:03,032
You're funny.

253
00:13:03,908 --> 00:13:04,575
I like you.

254
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:10,873
(Suspenseful music playing)

255
00:13:11,290 --> 00:13:15,002
[SUGAR VOICEOVER]
So you're the demon responsible for my brother's death.

256
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,003
200 more.

257
00:13:16,962 --> 00:13:17,463
Okay.

258
00:13:17,505 --> 00:13:19,548
Before you end up in hell,

259
00:13:20,758 --> 00:13:22,510
I'll take you to jail first.

260
00:13:23,636 --> 00:13:24,345
Are you delicious?

261
00:13:25,179 --> 00:13:25,554
Huh?

262
00:13:26,764 --> 00:13:27,765
I mean, are you a good cook?

263
00:13:28,140 --> 00:13:29,433
What's your speciality?

264
00:13:34,230 --> 00:13:35,855
After the guests finish their workout,

265
00:13:35,856 --> 00:13:38,859
they head straight to this bistro
for their post-workout meal.

266
00:13:39,151 --> 00:13:41,529
I want the menu to change every month,

267
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:43,614
and unhealthy foods are a no-go, alright?

268
00:13:44,031 --> 00:13:49,078
I don’t want anything with GMOs,
preservatives, or even artificial sweeteners.

269
00:13:49,745 --> 00:13:51,247
That would ruin my brand.

270
00:13:53,082 --> 00:13:54,291
Uh... your brand?

271
00:13:57,169 --> 00:14:02,967
Healthy and all-natural fitness
program for optimum performance.

272
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:03,551
I see.

273
00:14:03,592 --> 00:14:05,886
You know, I always tell my students that

274
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:07,805
if you want to be like me,

275
00:14:08,055 --> 00:14:09,390
all you need are two things.

276
00:14:10,266 --> 00:14:12,601
Discipline and dedication.

277
00:14:14,979 --> 00:14:16,105
Including steroids.

278
00:14:19,483 --> 00:14:20,484
Steroids?

279
00:14:23,445 --> 00:14:25,865
(Suspenseful music playing)

280
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:26,782
Feel this.

281
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:32,830
It's all natural.

282
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:36,500
Steroids are for losers.

283
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:49,763
(Upbeat instrumental playing)

284
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:57,187
I didn’t know plenty of influencers come here.

285
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:58,856
Are you talking about Liv?

286
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:01,609
The girl in pink, isn't she an influencer?

287
00:15:02,067 --> 00:15:03,110
She's not an influencer.

288
00:15:04,528 --> 00:15:07,865
I always see her in Coach Zach’s
social media posts.

289
00:15:08,824 --> 00:15:11,284
Isn’t that what they call a collaboration?

290
00:15:11,285 --> 00:15:12,202
Something like that.

291
00:15:12,286 --> 00:15:13,078
Are they close?

292
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,039
They're more than close.

293
00:15:28,677 --> 00:15:29,803
Who are those people she's with?

294
00:15:30,679 --> 00:15:32,556
The girl in white, that’s A.

295
00:15:33,515 --> 00:15:37,811
She might look like an angel,
but she definitely ain't one.

296
00:15:39,521 --> 00:15:43,067
And the one with the yellow ribbon, that’s Yana.

297
00:15:44,318 --> 00:15:47,196
They say her family’s so well-connected,

298
00:15:47,905 --> 00:15:52,743
and her dad works directly for a Dubai sheik.

299
00:15:54,870 --> 00:15:59,208
They’re known as "The Squad",
as in Pep Squad.

300
00:15:59,875 --> 00:16:02,628
They used to be campus cheerleaders that

301
00:16:02,711 --> 00:16:04,088
became inseparable friends.

302
00:16:04,296 --> 00:16:09,426
Like a perfectly balanced pyramid
that can’t be knocked down.

303
00:16:26,568 --> 00:16:30,948
(Suspenseful music playing)

304
00:17:03,897 --> 00:17:05,232
Why are you following me? Huh?

305
00:17:05,357 --> 00:17:05,649
Huh?

306
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:06,358
Why?

307
00:17:09,820 --> 00:17:10,529
Why are you following me?

308
00:17:10,571 --> 00:17:12,865
I'm not following you, ma'am.

309
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:13,741
Don’t come any closer.

310
00:17:14,450 --> 00:17:15,325
You’ve been following me since the gym.

311
00:17:16,118 --> 00:17:17,785
I’m not following you, ma’am.

312
00:17:17,786 --> 00:17:19,705
I’m just looking for a place to rent.

313
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,457
Somewhere close to the gym.

314
00:17:21,498 --> 00:17:25,502
Someone mentioned that I might find a place to rent here.

315
00:17:26,587 --> 00:17:29,923
It’s too difficult to go back to the province after work.

316
00:17:30,507 --> 00:17:31,592
Are you sure you work at the gym?

317
00:17:31,842 --> 00:17:32,384
Yes.

318
00:17:32,384 --> 00:17:33,135
Show me your ID.

319
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:34,511
Hurry up, hand it over!

320
00:17:36,263 --> 00:17:37,556
Here you go. Here's my ID.

321
00:17:50,861 --> 00:17:51,278
Hello?

322
00:17:51,904 --> 00:17:52,571
Yeah, Zach.

323
00:17:53,447 --> 00:17:56,575
Do you know anyone named Sugar Alvarez?

324
00:18:07,878 --> 00:18:08,504
Here you go.

325
00:18:10,964 --> 00:18:11,965
7,000 a month.

326
00:18:12,674 --> 00:18:14,635
That includes water, electricity, and wi-fi.

327
00:18:14,802 --> 00:18:16,345
Two months advance, two months deposit.

328
00:18:17,554 --> 00:18:19,056
That’s way too expensive!

329
00:18:20,641 --> 00:18:21,892
Can’t you give me a discount?

330
00:18:22,935 --> 00:18:24,228
Please, madam.

331
00:18:25,020 --> 00:18:27,815
You don’t look like the selfish type.

332
00:18:29,274 --> 00:18:33,654
Honestly, you look like you’re
overflowing with blessings.

333
00:18:33,695 --> 00:18:35,364
Share some with me, won’t you?

334
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:39,368
Oh, wait—look at that!
You’re smiling! I knew it!

335
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:42,329
Turns out, you're not the stone-cold,
no-smile type after all.

336
00:18:42,412 --> 00:18:44,123
See how witty I am?

337
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:48,043
Now that you’re laughing,
can you finally give me a discount?

338
00:18:48,335 --> 00:18:49,836
Okay, fine, fine.

339
00:18:49,837 --> 00:18:50,838
Okay, you good now?

340
00:18:50,963 --> 00:18:52,714
- Are you done?
- Okay, I'm done.

341
00:18:53,257 --> 00:18:53,799
(Deep breath)

342
00:18:54,174 --> 00:18:56,426
Okay, and since you're Zach’s employee,

343
00:18:58,512 --> 00:18:59,555
you can just pay a
one-month deposit instead.

344
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:00,055
Perfect!

345
00:19:00,806 --> 00:19:01,265
Thank you.

346
00:19:01,890 --> 00:19:03,308
Consider that as reparations
for what happened earlier.

347
00:19:05,978 --> 00:19:07,688
Also, I’m sorry about the...

348
00:19:07,771 --> 00:19:08,730
the taser.

349
00:19:09,690 --> 00:19:11,900
It’s just that Mom and I are the only ones at home,

350
00:19:11,942 --> 00:19:13,527
so she taught me to be extra vigilant.

351
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:16,029
You don't have a dad?

352
00:19:16,613 --> 00:19:17,531
Oh no, I mean...

353
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:19,366
My dad’s still alive.

354
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,120
It’s just that Mom and I don't live with him.

355
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,414
(Humming softly)

356
00:19:26,081 --> 00:19:27,206
How about you?

357
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,917
Your family? Are they with you?

358
00:19:29,334 --> 00:19:30,752
They're in the province.

359
00:19:31,461 --> 00:19:33,672
My Papa works as a security guard.

360
00:19:34,631 --> 00:19:37,926
My Mama stays with my
younger brother because

361
00:19:38,385 --> 00:19:40,429
he just started his first year of college.

362
00:19:41,638 --> 00:19:44,099
So, they’re relying on me.

363
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,977
I can't afford to fail in my mission here.

364
00:19:50,230 --> 00:19:51,940
Actually, Zach may look mean,

365
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:56,570
but he's not a difficult person to please.

366
00:19:56,904 --> 00:19:57,905
I’ve heard that...

not many people stick around with Coach Zach.

368
00:20:02,492 --> 00:20:07,247
Employees, and especially trainees.

369
00:20:08,290 --> 00:20:09,583
Do you know anything about that?

370
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,630
Well, he doesn’t really discuss his work with me.

371
00:20:16,089 --> 00:20:16,965
It’s his business,

372
00:20:20,344 --> 00:20:22,596
and he should manage it the way he deems best.

373
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:25,974
And since we’re going to be housemates now,

374
00:20:29,519 --> 00:20:32,898
I will tell you Zach’s biggest secret.

375
00:20:34,900 --> 00:20:35,734
What is it?

376

Coach Zach, there's something I want you to try.

380

How surprising!

381
00:21:40,966 --> 00:21:42,926
I've been meaning to give you this.

382
00:21:43,135 --> 00:21:45,095
One for you, and one for us.

383
00:21:45,846 --> 00:21:47,264
It’s important that you take care of it, okay?

384
00:21:47,764 --> 00:21:51,143
If you ever start missing us, just look at it,

385
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:52,894

387
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:23,342
Coach is really kind.

388
00:22:24,634 --> 00:22:26,136
I can't say anything bad about him.

389
00:22:26,803 --> 00:22:28,388
He's easy to work with.

390
00:22:30,265 --> 00:22:31,932
This is why I feel sorry for him.

391
00:22:31,933 --> 00:22:34,770
I don't know why this happened to him,

392
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:38,023
or who would do this to him.

393
00:22:39,149 --> 00:22:41,026
But I believe in karma.

394
00:22:41,568 --> 00:22:43,403
If you do wrong things to other people,

395
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:44,863
it's true that...

396
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:48,742

- What exactly happened?
- Just tell us already.

- Sugar, tell us!
- What did he ask you?

Sugar, you're not saying anything!

Did you see anything?

Does Coach have something against you
to be saying stuff like this?

418
00:23:52,681 --> 00:23:53,723
Why would he do that?
