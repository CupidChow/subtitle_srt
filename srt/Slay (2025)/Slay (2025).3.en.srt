1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:06,214
(Gemini by Julie Anne San Jose Playing)

2
00:00:09,718 --> 00:00:13,013
I'm used to cooking food over fire,

3
00:00:13,388 --> 00:00:14,431
not people.

4
00:00:14,723 --> 00:00:19,185
Whoever did this to coach
wanted to make him suffer.

5
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:20,687
I will kill him!

6
00:00:20,854 --> 00:00:21,979
Who did you fight with?

7
00:00:21,980 --> 00:00:23,940
That monstrous coach is biased.

8
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,985
He didn't include me in the lineup
because I refused to take steroids.

9
00:00:27,277 --> 00:00:30,739
He had a heart attack while working out.

10
00:00:31,031 --> 00:00:33,825
The weights he was holding slipped from his hands.

11
00:00:34,075 --> 00:00:38,121
Steroids, this was the
reason why he had a heart attack.

12
00:00:39,664 --> 00:00:41,416
I finally found our new chef.

13
00:00:41,624 --> 00:00:42,751
Meet Sugar Alvarez.

14
00:00:42,959 --> 00:00:44,418
Sugar Alvarez.

15
00:00:44,419 --> 00:00:45,628
Nice to meet you, coach.

16
00:00:45,795 --> 00:00:49,049
- Sugar, hurry up and just tell us already!
- Come on, tell us what he said!

17
00:00:49,424 --> 00:00:50,091
Who's next?

18
00:00:57,307 --> 00:01:03,146
(Theme song playing)

19
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:41,100
Every after workout, I make sure I cover myself with this.

20
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:42,310
Tea tree oil.

21
00:01:43,394 --> 00:01:48,566
It soothes my skin, and it relaxes my muscles.

22
00:01:49,484 --> 00:01:52,195
People often compare women to fire.

23
00:01:52,403 --> 00:01:55,030
A woman is warm, a woman is glowing.

24
00:01:55,031 --> 00:01:56,908
She is hot.

25
00:02:09,462 --> 00:02:13,882
Just like fire, a woman can
either choose to spark life or destroy it.

26
00:02:13,883 --> 00:02:17,554
She can even choose to bring
warmth or ignite chaos.

27
00:02:20,390 --> 00:02:21,808
(Deep breath)

28
00:02:24,727 --> 00:02:26,061
The question is...

29
00:02:26,062 --> 00:02:28,022
Which kind of woman do you deserve?

30
00:02:28,189 --> 00:02:29,274
(Grunts)

31
00:02:32,443 --> 00:02:37,282
And before we end another
episode of workout with Coach Z,

32
00:02:38,324 --> 00:02:42,412
let's remember to pause, meditate...

33
00:02:43,955 --> 00:02:45,915
...and let your body rest.

34
00:02:52,589 --> 00:02:54,673
- "You're so delicious, sir!"
- "Internet legend!"

35
00:02:54,674 --> 00:02:57,760
-"Mom, rice please! Coach Zach's
abs is my main dish!"

36
00:02:58,386 --> 00:02:59,095
(Screaming in agony)

37
00:02:59,096 --> 00:03:04,726
(Fire alarm beeping)

38
00:03:05,018 --> 00:03:10,315
(Screaming in agony)
(Fire alarm beeping)

39
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,098
Liv?

40
00:03:45,099 --> 00:03:45,808
A?

41
00:03:45,809 --> 00:03:47,560
- What are you doing here?
- What's happening?

42
00:03:47,769 --> 00:03:48,186
I don't know.

43
00:03:48,561 --> 00:03:50,063
It looks like there's a fire.

44
00:03:52,190 --> 00:03:54,901
(Fire alarm beeping)
(Screaming in agony)

45
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:56,069
Coach!

46
00:03:56,444 --> 00:03:57,237
Coach!

47
00:03:57,779 --> 00:03:59,364
Oh my god!

48
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,200
Coach!

49
00:04:02,617 --> 00:04:03,493
Coach!

50
00:04:06,496 --> 00:04:07,121
Coach!

51
00:04:09,332 --> 00:04:15,630
(Screaming in agony) (Fire alarm beeping)

52
00:04:24,097 --> 00:04:25,014
Are you done?

53
00:04:26,933 --> 00:04:27,892
Can I interview you now?

54
00:04:29,852 --> 00:04:31,145
That was my fiancé.

55
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:34,941
He just told me that I shouldn't be talking
to you without a lawyer present.

56
00:04:35,358 --> 00:04:37,902
Look, Miss, um...

57
00:04:38,111 --> 00:04:38,945
Baltazar.

58
00:04:39,487 --> 00:04:40,697
My question is simple.

59
00:04:41,572 --> 00:04:43,866
I just want to know what you saw.

60
00:04:44,242 --> 00:04:46,244
Well, basically, we saw the same thing.

61
00:04:46,703 --> 00:04:47,954
Zach was on fire.

62
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,706
What more do you want from me?

63
00:04:50,915 --> 00:04:52,208
Your cooperation.

64
00:04:53,126 --> 00:04:54,419
Don't you want the case solved?

65
00:04:55,920 --> 00:04:57,880
Aren't you interested to find out

66
00:04:58,339 --> 00:04:59,799
who did this to your friend?

67
00:05:02,927 --> 00:05:04,512
Zach, stop bothering me.

68
00:05:05,471 --> 00:05:07,807
Don't be assuming, I didn't come here for you.

69
00:05:09,934 --> 00:05:12,478
Luke! My brother, hello!

70
00:05:12,603 --> 00:05:13,563
Hi, Auntie!

71
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:14,939
- Hi!
- Hey, Zach!

72
00:05:15,315 --> 00:05:16,316
(Grunts) Okay.

73
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,152
- Hi, Auntie. Nice to see you.
- Hi, nice to see you, dear.

74
00:05:19,277 --> 00:05:20,236
How's the gym?

75
00:05:20,528 --> 00:05:21,487
The gym is doing good.

76
00:05:21,488 --> 00:05:23,196
We have plenty of new clients, right?

77
00:05:23,197 --> 00:05:23,614
Yeah.

78
00:05:23,823 --> 00:05:26,993
In fact, the reason why I'm here now is
because I wanted to give you this.

79
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:30,038
It's your share for being an investor of the gym.

80
00:05:30,663 --> 00:05:32,081
Alright!

81
00:05:32,457 --> 00:05:33,207
Umm...

82
00:05:34,292 --> 00:05:35,001
Thanks.

83
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:36,252
- Alright.
- Thanks, Zach.

84
00:05:36,419 --> 00:05:39,630
Now you've got something extra
for your wedding with Amelie.

85
00:05:40,298 --> 00:05:42,383
It's as if Luke is the one covering the costs!

86
00:05:42,508 --> 00:05:43,884
I already spoke to Luke's mom,

87
00:05:43,885 --> 00:05:45,595
and she said she'll take care of everything.

88
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:48,056
As long as the wedding turns out to be fabulous!

89
00:05:48,222 --> 00:05:50,807
- So exciting!
- Actually Mom...

90
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:53,436
I was thinking we want something...

91
00:05:53,978 --> 00:05:55,396
Something a bit smaller...

92
00:05:55,605 --> 00:05:56,397
More intimate...

93
00:05:56,564 --> 00:05:58,775
Maybe Bali, or Phuket.

94
00:05:58,941 --> 00:06:00,360
With friends and family only.

95
00:06:00,735 --> 00:06:02,612
Weren't you listening, Amelie?

96
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,198
The wedding has to be big.

97
00:06:05,448 --> 00:06:06,907
My visitors are already excited.

98
00:06:06,908 --> 00:06:08,201
(Chuckles)

99
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:10,119
Amelie, Auntie's right.

100
00:06:10,286 --> 00:06:13,122
Many people should witness your wedding.

101
00:06:13,289 --> 00:06:16,125
It's not like you're ashamed of Luke, right?

102
00:06:17,418 --> 00:06:18,169
(Scoffs)

103
00:06:22,465 --> 00:06:24,758
Anyway Liv, you have to be there.

104
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,219
You're my Maid of Honor.

105
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:27,678
Okay, see you soon.

106
00:06:28,679 --> 00:06:29,013
Bye.

107
00:06:30,765 --> 00:06:34,185
Dear, do you really have to invite
that woman to your wedding?

108
00:06:34,936 --> 00:06:37,021
Mom, she's family.

109
00:06:37,480 --> 00:06:38,523
She's my sister.

110
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,024
Half-sister.

111
00:06:40,274 --> 00:06:41,984
A child out of wedlock.

112
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,695
She's actually a stain in our reputation.

113
00:06:45,613 --> 00:06:46,155
(Sighs)

114
00:06:46,156 --> 00:06:51,202
Mom, it's not such a big deal that I have a half-sister.

115
00:06:51,828 --> 00:06:53,788
Also, we're no longer in the '70s.

116
00:06:53,955 --> 00:06:56,165
Having an illegitimate child is no longer an issue.

117
00:06:56,290 --> 00:06:58,834
Don't you give me that woke, progressive lecture.

118
00:06:58,835 --> 00:07:02,713
Once you're married,
you'll understand.

119
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:04,841
When you take his last name,

120
00:07:05,216 --> 00:07:07,051
you take on all his problems too.

121
00:07:07,844 --> 00:07:10,388
If you didn't want someone with a child,

122
00:07:11,055 --> 00:07:13,015
why did you marry Dad?

123
00:07:15,059 --> 00:07:18,146
Well, because my love for him is bigger than his past.

124
00:07:32,118 --> 00:07:33,536
Come here.

125
00:07:33,786 --> 00:07:36,037
You should always put oil here.

126
00:07:36,038 --> 00:07:38,666
Let's take care of the equipment, alright?

127
00:07:45,882 --> 00:07:46,257
A.

128
00:07:48,468 --> 00:07:50,887
Have you spoken with Liv?

129
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:54,807
What? Why?

130
00:07:55,016 --> 00:07:55,683
Last night?

131
00:07:57,602 --> 00:07:58,060
Yeah.

132
00:07:58,728 --> 00:08:01,063
Did she mention anything about me, or about violence?

133
00:08:03,858 --> 00:08:05,568
We didn't discuss anything.

134
00:08:11,657 --> 00:08:12,575
Why?

135
00:08:14,035 --> 00:08:15,286
What did you do this time?

136
00:08:15,995 --> 00:08:17,788
Tell me, did you cheat on Liv?

137
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,583
Zach, did you cheat on Liv?

138
00:08:21,584 --> 00:08:22,626
Answer me.

139
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:25,713
Liv told me about a girl she's been jealous of.

140
00:08:26,839 --> 00:08:27,882
So what now, Zach?

141
00:08:28,257 --> 00:08:29,091
Look at me!

142
00:08:30,092 --> 00:08:31,511
Did you cheat on Liv?

143
00:08:34,430 --> 00:08:36,933
There's nothing going on
between me and that woman!

144
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:38,601
What's your problem?!

145
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:40,186
You're both the same!

146
00:08:41,854 --> 00:08:42,647
Forget it!

147
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:49,278
(Exclaims loudly) Luke!

148
00:08:49,904 --> 00:08:51,154
Let's spar.

149
00:08:51,155 --> 00:08:53,449
You're already too advanced for him,
it's time to level up.

150
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:56,911
- Sure thing, bro.
- Okay.

151
00:09:03,417 --> 00:09:05,127
Alright, I'll start down here so that...

152
00:09:05,378 --> 00:09:05,670
Okay.

153
00:09:06,003 --> 00:09:07,463
...so you have an advantage, bro.

154
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:08,673
Okay, okay, alright.

155
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:16,806
Oh, you're getting strong, Luke!

156
00:09:16,931 --> 00:09:18,224
(Laughs)

157
00:09:20,893 --> 00:09:23,020
(Grunts)

158
00:09:28,359 --> 00:09:28,901
Luke!

159
00:09:29,193 --> 00:09:29,860
Hey, Zach!

160
00:09:29,861 --> 00:09:32,112
(Grunting)

161
00:09:32,113 --> 00:09:36,032
(People cheering)

162
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:38,118
Zach, Luke, that's enough!

163
00:09:38,119 --> 00:09:38,911
Luke!

164
00:09:39,036 --> 00:09:40,329
Can't you see he's tapping out?!

165
00:09:40,621 --> 00:09:41,247
That's enough!

166
00:09:41,414 --> 00:09:41,872
Luke!

167
00:09:42,039 --> 00:09:43,165
Luke!

168
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:43,958
Luke!

169
00:09:44,125 --> 00:09:44,667
Luke!

170
00:09:45,681 --> 00:09:46,432
Hey, what's wrong?

171
00:09:46,433 --> 00:09:48,266
Didn't you see that he tapped out
for quite some time now?!

172
00:09:48,267 --> 00:09:49,309
We were just playing!

173
00:09:49,310 --> 00:09:50,435
- What's wrong with that?
- Luke!

174
00:09:50,436 --> 00:09:51,104
- We were just playing.
- Here's the deal...

175
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:52,479
- This is how we fight.
- If you and Liv are fighting,

176
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,314
don't take it out on my fiancée, Zach!

177
00:09:54,315 --> 00:09:55,650
Oh, okay, okay.

178
00:09:55,858 --> 00:09:56,943
This is how we usually do things here.

179
00:09:57,110 --> 00:09:58,069
What's the big deal?

180
00:09:58,069 --> 00:09:58,403
God!

181
00:09:58,694 --> 00:09:59,654
Shut up, Zach!

182
00:09:59,654 --> 00:10:00,488
Listen to me.

183
00:10:01,155 --> 00:10:02,323
What I dislike is...

184
00:10:04,075 --> 00:10:06,119
when a woman acts
arrogant towards me.

185
00:10:07,286 --> 00:10:09,205
(Grunts in frustration)

186
00:10:09,872 --> 00:10:10,456
Nice one!

187
00:10:10,957 --> 00:10:12,291
What was that about?

188
00:10:12,583 --> 00:10:13,583
How are you, Luke?

189
00:10:13,584 --> 00:10:14,502
Are you alright?

190
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:16,337
Shut up!

191
00:10:17,171 --> 00:10:17,880
Asshole.

192
00:10:18,965 --> 00:10:19,674
You good?

193
00:10:20,633 --> 00:10:21,509
See?

194
00:10:21,968 --> 00:10:22,802
He's doing just fine.

195
00:10:26,597 --> 00:10:27,849
I'm good.

196
00:10:28,057 --> 00:10:29,724
See? He's alright!

197
00:10:29,725 --> 00:10:31,435
What's the big deal? My God!

198
00:10:31,436 --> 00:10:34,897
Next time bro, tap harder. I didn't feel it.
I'm sorry, okay?

199
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:37,316
(Scoffs)

200
00:10:38,025 --> 00:10:40,153
God! These people! So petty!

201
00:10:40,361 --> 00:10:42,155
(Exclaims)

202
00:10:43,197 --> 00:10:45,158
That was embarrassing,
why did you do that?

203
00:10:46,325 --> 00:10:48,244
There... there were people watching.

204
00:10:49,745 --> 00:10:51,414
Luke, I was just defending you!

205
00:10:52,248 --> 00:10:53,791
I looked like a weakling.

206
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,127
I'll go get some ice.

207
00:11:08,931 --> 00:11:11,601
Luke, so what? You're not gonna see me anymore?

208
00:11:13,561 --> 00:11:15,229
You're working overtime again?

209
00:11:16,230 --> 00:11:18,274
But Luke, you told me
you were gonna see me!

210
00:11:19,150 --> 00:11:21,527
So, now you prioritize your work over me?

211
00:11:25,406 --> 00:11:26,324
Is that for Amelie?

212
00:11:26,491 --> 00:11:27,283
Yes, sir.

213
00:11:31,829 --> 00:11:32,830
Yeah, okay!

214
00:11:33,664 --> 00:11:38,294
(Suspenseful music playing)

215
00:11:41,339 --> 00:11:42,590
I need you now!

216
00:11:45,134 --> 00:11:46,676
No, that's so unfair!

217
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:47,678
You're always like that!

218
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,806
You'd rather spend your time there than be with me.

219
00:11:51,182 --> 00:11:52,725
You're so unfair!

220
00:11:56,103 --> 00:11:57,687
You have to give me a specific time.

221
00:11:57,688 --> 00:11:59,857
I can't just wait here for nothing.

222
00:12:04,695 --> 00:12:05,821
Really?

223
00:12:06,781 --> 00:12:07,823
What now?!

224
00:12:09,450 --> 00:12:10,701
I don't know about you anymore!

225
00:12:10,868 --> 00:12:12,453
You're always like this, Luke.

226
00:12:12,995 --> 00:12:13,829
And then?

227
00:12:16,958 --> 00:12:17,542
You know what?

228
00:12:17,917 --> 00:12:19,669
Whatever Luke, forget it!

229
00:12:19,919 --> 00:12:22,129
I'm no longer in the mood to see your face anyway!

230
00:12:22,630 --> 00:12:23,673
Forget it!

231
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:31,847
Try our S'mores Tart as well.

232
00:12:32,223 --> 00:12:33,599
This is my specialty.

233
00:12:43,067 --> 00:12:43,776
(Coughs in disgust)

234
00:12:44,944 --> 00:12:45,903
That's salty!

235
00:12:46,070 --> 00:12:48,406
Did you put salt in there?!
I didn't, ma'am.

236
00:12:48,614 --> 00:12:49,323
What do you mean?!

237
00:12:49,324 --> 00:12:51,408
Taste it!

238
00:12:51,409 --> 00:12:52,034
(Screams in pain)

239
00:12:52,702 --> 00:12:53,286
Ouch!

240
00:12:53,494 --> 00:12:54,662
I said, try it!

241
00:12:55,496 --> 00:12:57,331
You're crossing the line.

242
00:12:58,082 --> 00:13:01,001
You have no right to disrespect me,
even if you're a customer!

243
00:13:01,002 --> 00:13:02,211
How dare you talk back?

244
00:13:02,378 --> 00:13:03,504
Why? Who do you think you are?

245
00:13:03,713 --> 00:13:05,590
You're nothing but a dumb server!

246
00:13:06,007 --> 00:13:06,882
I'm a chef here.

247
00:13:06,882 --> 00:13:07,466
Chef?!

248
00:13:07,592 --> 00:13:08,801
A dumb chef!

249
00:13:08,968 --> 00:13:09,927
My God!

250
00:13:10,219 --> 00:13:11,721
You don't even know how to take orders!

251
00:13:12,179 --> 00:13:12,888
Stupid!

252
00:13:23,024 --> 00:13:24,566
- Oh!
- Alright, Miss A,

253
00:13:24,567 --> 00:13:26,611
let's take a look at your back.

254
00:13:27,153 --> 00:13:28,946
- I like this one!
- 15 and a half.

255
00:13:29,572 --> 00:13:31,990
Ball gown with crystals on it!

256
00:13:31,991 --> 00:13:32,992
- Alright.
- Jonas!

257
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:34,076
- Oh.
- I like this one.

258
00:13:34,077 --> 00:13:35,786
- Show it to Amelie.
- Yes, ma'am.

259
00:13:36,829 --> 00:13:38,331
Oh, this is nice.

260
00:13:41,334 --> 00:13:42,293
This one.

261
00:13:43,044 --> 00:13:45,129
This one looks really good, right?

262
00:13:46,130 --> 00:13:47,465
Do you like this Miss A?

263
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:55,139
I'll just go with the one from earlier instead.

264
00:13:55,431 --> 00:13:57,057
The ball gown with the crystals.

265
00:13:57,058 --> 00:14:00,144
Alright! I think it's perfect, madam!

266
00:14:03,564 --> 00:14:05,232
"Viral Videos Now"

267
00:14:05,399 --> 00:14:07,443
Taste it!
I think this is her.

268
00:14:07,860 --> 00:14:09,027
(Murmuring)

269
00:14:09,028 --> 00:14:10,236
Even if you're a customer here,

270
00:14:10,237 --> 00:14:11,988
you've no right to disrespect me like that.

271
00:14:11,989 --> 00:14:14,158
Yes? Is there something you want to say?

272
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:17,119
Ma'am, Miss A resembles the girl in the video.

273
00:14:17,495 --> 00:14:18,621
What video?

274
00:14:24,669 --> 00:14:25,835
Taste it!

275
00:14:25,836 --> 00:14:27,171
- I said try it!
- Ma'am!

276
00:14:27,588 --> 00:14:29,340
You're crossing the line.

277
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:31,549
Even if you're a customer here,

278
00:14:31,550 --> 00:14:33,843
you've no right to disrespect me like this.

279
00:14:33,844 --> 00:14:34,470
And why…

280
00:14:34,804 --> 00:14:36,013
This is not her.

281
00:14:36,263 --> 00:14:37,390
She just look like Amelie.

282
00:14:38,224 --> 00:14:41,685
My daughter will never do
something as cheap as this.

283
00:14:41,686 --> 00:14:43,062
You're a dumb chef!

284
00:14:43,521 --> 00:14:44,522
My God!

285
00:14:45,731 --> 00:14:46,815
You know what, guys?

286
00:14:46,816 --> 00:14:47,525
It's a wrap.

287
00:14:47,650 --> 00:14:49,735
We're done here, you can leave.

288
00:14:50,861 --> 00:14:51,404
Go ahead.

289
00:14:51,529 --> 00:14:54,490
Take the stuff! Hurry up!

290
00:14:55,574 --> 00:14:56,325
Let's go!

291
00:15:00,496 --> 00:15:02,957
You are such an embarrassment.

292
00:15:03,624 --> 00:15:05,209
Why are you embarrassing me?

293
00:15:05,543 --> 00:15:06,752
What have you done?

294
00:15:07,294 --> 00:15:07,920
Answer me!

295
00:15:07,921 --> 00:15:09,587
Why did you do that?!

296
00:15:09,588 --> 00:15:10,839
What was that stupidity all about?!

297
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:11,716
What was that?!

298
00:15:11,716 --> 00:15:12,049
Mom!

299
00:15:12,049 --> 00:15:12,842
Why?!

300
00:15:12,842 --> 00:15:13,426
That hurts!

301
00:15:13,676 --> 00:15:14,385
Why?

302
00:15:14,677 --> 00:15:16,220
Why did you do that?!

303
00:15:19,598 --> 00:15:20,099
The...

304
00:15:20,433 --> 00:15:21,934
The chef put...

305
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:24,103
She put salt in my coffee.

306
00:15:25,563 --> 00:15:27,439
I got mad. I snapped at her.

307
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:28,357
She's so stupid!

308
00:15:29,233 --> 00:15:30,276
Stupid?!

309
00:15:31,527 --> 00:15:34,155
There are a lot of stupid
people in the world, Amelie.

310
00:15:34,613 --> 00:15:39,869
Your job is to make sure their
stupidity does not affect you.

311
00:15:40,494 --> 00:15:43,122
It's not just you who will be put to shame.

312
00:15:43,664 --> 00:15:45,583
Have you thought about
how this impacts me?

313
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:47,460
What will my friends say?

314
00:15:47,835 --> 00:15:49,670
What will Luke's family say?!

315
00:15:50,963 --> 00:15:51,464
Really?

316
00:15:53,674 --> 00:15:56,385
You're worried about what other people think?

317
00:15:57,636 --> 00:16:00,181
Did you even ask how I'm doing?

318
00:16:00,848 --> 00:16:03,184
If I'm okay? Or what I'm feeling?

319
00:16:03,392 --> 00:16:03,934
Stop!

320
00:16:04,643 --> 00:16:05,936
I'm not a bad mother!

321
00:16:06,771 --> 00:16:09,398
You're the one with the scandalous video!

322
00:16:10,566 --> 00:16:11,734
I'm sorry, I'm stupid.

323
00:16:12,735 --> 00:16:16,781
Yes Amelie, that was so stupid!

324
00:16:18,073 --> 00:16:19,241
No.

325
00:16:20,534 --> 00:16:24,830
It was stupid of me to expect you
to have a little bit of compassion!

326
00:16:25,956 --> 00:16:26,749
But no.

327
00:16:27,625 --> 00:16:30,127
You're only worried about your reputation!

328
00:16:30,336 --> 00:16:34,882
(Emotional music playing)

329
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:56,654
Ma'am, here are your drinks.

330
00:17:13,754 --> 00:17:14,880
(Sighs deeply)

331
00:17:31,647 --> 00:17:32,857
Are you stalking me?

332
00:17:33,357 --> 00:17:34,441
You're overreacting.

333
00:17:34,817 --> 00:17:36,026
Stalking really?

334
00:17:36,485 --> 00:17:38,863
Can't it be that I just want to talk?

335
00:17:39,196 --> 00:17:40,030
What for?

336
00:17:41,198 --> 00:17:43,075
To ruin my life even more?

337
00:17:43,409 --> 00:17:45,160
Haven't you done enough damage?

338
00:17:46,871 --> 00:17:50,749
People are canceling me now
because of your stupidity.

339
00:17:55,254 --> 00:17:56,380
There's salt on your face.

340
00:17:57,590 --> 00:17:58,799
And on the other side too.

341
00:18:00,551 --> 00:18:02,303
Darn it! Isn't this what you wanted?!

342
00:18:02,428 --> 00:18:03,470
You're so frustrating!

343
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:06,222
I told you, I wasn't the one who sabotaged-
Whatever!

344
00:18:06,223 --> 00:18:07,933
The damage has been done!

345
00:18:08,392 --> 00:18:09,893
No matter how much you apologize,

346
00:18:09,894 --> 00:18:11,352
you can't take it back.

347
00:18:11,353 --> 00:18:12,104
Stupid!

348
00:18:12,229 --> 00:18:16,442
First of all, I have no plans of apologizing to you.

349
00:18:17,943 --> 00:18:20,446
I approached you because I pity you.

350
00:18:21,530 --> 00:18:23,365
I don't need your pity!

351
00:18:25,784 --> 00:18:26,994
It was Coach Zach.

352
00:18:28,245 --> 00:18:29,955
He circulated that video.

353
00:18:30,122 --> 00:18:32,333
He was recording us the
whole time it was happening.

354
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,586
I also think he was the one
who put salt in your coffee.

355
00:18:38,714 --> 00:18:41,175
He was the only person there
when everything happened.

356
00:18:41,926 --> 00:18:43,218
Why would he do that?

357
00:18:43,427 --> 00:18:45,763
That's what I wanted to ask you.

358
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,933
What did you do for him to sabotage you like this?

359
00:18:49,141 --> 00:18:49,975
How about you?

360
00:18:51,018 --> 00:18:52,728
Why are you telling me this now?!

361
00:18:52,895 --> 00:18:56,356
I actually wanted to talk to Liv about this, but...

362
00:18:56,357 --> 00:18:57,149
You know her?

363
00:18:58,025 --> 00:18:59,151
You know my sister?

364
00:18:59,318 --> 00:19:04,239
Yeah, I live with her.
I'm currently renting a place from her.

365
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:07,326
Your sister's really nice,
I don't know what happened you.

366
00:19:07,493 --> 00:19:09,495
The thing is, Liv might think

367
00:19:09,745 --> 00:19:11,956
I'm trying to sabotage her boyfriend.

368
00:19:12,373 --> 00:19:17,127
But then I realized that you were the one getting slandered.

369
00:19:17,628 --> 00:19:20,714
So you deserve to know who sabotaged you.

370
00:19:25,052 --> 00:19:27,930
And how will I know if you're telling the truth?

371
00:19:29,098 --> 00:19:32,476
That you're not making up some stupid story?

372
00:19:33,185 --> 00:19:36,230
(Chuckling)

373
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:41,652
What will I even gain from
pitting you against Coach?

374
00:19:42,695 --> 00:19:44,738
If you don't believe me, that's your choice.

375
00:19:45,114 --> 00:19:47,491
You can always find the truth yourself.

376
00:19:55,749 --> 00:19:56,583
(Scoffs in disgust)

377
00:20:05,592 --> 00:20:06,677
Come on, keep up!

378
00:20:07,761 --> 00:20:09,220
Slow down, bestie.

379
00:20:09,221 --> 00:20:10,681
- I'm already tired.
- Come on, faster!

380
00:20:13,809 --> 00:20:14,560
- Break!
- Hold on.

381
00:20:14,561 --> 00:20:15,728
Wait, I have an idea.

382
00:20:16,937 --> 00:20:18,230
You know what, I think...

383
00:20:18,772 --> 00:20:22,526
today is the perfect day for you to
propose your business deal to Zach.

384
00:20:23,962 --> 00:20:24,838
Are you sure?

385
00:20:24,863 --> 00:20:26,364
Yeah, trust me, bestie.

386
00:20:26,906 --> 00:20:28,449
You know that I'm rooting for you.

387
00:20:28,824 --> 00:20:30,034
You can do it. Hold on.

388
00:20:31,535 --> 00:20:32,328
Emman?

389
00:20:32,578 --> 00:20:35,413
Oh. What is it, ma'am?

390
00:20:35,414 --> 00:20:37,083
Emman, please call your boss.

391
00:20:37,875 --> 00:20:39,168
Uh, what should I say to him?

392
00:20:39,585 --> 00:20:41,878
Stop asking, just call him already, hurry.

393
00:20:41,879 --> 00:20:42,713
Alright then.

394
00:20:51,389 --> 00:20:52,473
You can do it, bestie.

395
00:20:52,765 --> 00:20:54,558
You can do it, I trust you.

396
00:20:55,059 --> 00:20:56,143
Go bestie!

397
00:20:56,978 --> 00:20:57,979
Bestie, wait!

398
00:21:01,399 --> 00:21:02,566
Uh, Coach?

399
00:21:03,401 --> 00:21:05,277
Miss A asked me to call you.

400
00:21:05,820 --> 00:21:06,445
What is it about?

401
00:21:08,114 --> 00:21:09,322
I have no idea.

402
00:21:09,323 --> 00:21:11,283
She just said she needs you.

403
00:21:15,329 --> 00:21:20,835
(Suspenseful music playing)

404
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:34,056
What's this?

405
00:21:35,808 --> 00:21:36,892
- Uh...
- This is such a mess!

406
00:21:38,436 --> 00:21:40,061
We have so many clients here.

407
00:21:40,062 --> 00:21:41,731
Didn't I remind you countless times?

408
00:21:41,856 --> 00:21:43,816
Isn't it getting through to your head?!

409
00:21:45,026 --> 00:21:47,153
Clean up this mess, or else you'll get it from me!

410
00:21:47,611 --> 00:21:49,237
Alright coach, I'm really sorry.

411
00:21:49,238 --> 00:21:50,114
- I'm sorry.
- Hurry!

412
00:21:51,907 --> 00:21:53,492
Oh, hi sir.

413
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:54,702
- Hello.
- How are you, sir?

414
00:21:55,036 --> 00:21:55,661
Yeah, I'm good.

415
00:21:55,870 --> 00:21:57,912
Are you enjoying your workout here so far?

416
00:21:57,913 --> 00:21:58,664
Yeah, yeah.

417
00:21:59,206 --> 00:22:01,332
How long have you been a member here for?

418
00:22:01,333 --> 00:22:02,251
If you don't mind me asking.

419
00:22:02,252 --> 00:22:04,211
Uh... going two.

420
00:22:04,462 --> 00:22:06,047
- Going two years now?
- Yes.

421
00:22:06,213 --> 00:22:09,382
I've noticed how much you've improved
compared to the first time you were here.

422
00:22:09,383 --> 00:22:10,885
Your cardio has gotten stronger too.

423
00:22:11,135 --> 00:22:12,886
- Looks like you're doing cardio everyday.
- Yes.

424
00:22:12,887 --> 00:22:14,346
Thank you, thank you.

425
00:22:17,141 --> 00:22:20,603
(Murmuring)

426
00:22:20,770 --> 00:22:21,437
- Ma'am!
- Taste it!

427
00:22:21,437 --> 00:22:22,188
- I said try it!
- Hey!

428
00:22:22,188 --> 00:22:22,938
Ma'am!

429
00:22:23,981 --> 00:22:25,316
You're crossing the line.

430
00:22:26,442 --> 00:22:27,068
Try it!

431
00:22:27,068 --> 00:22:27,777
I said try it!

432
00:22:27,778 --> 00:22:30,237
Hey! Ma'am, you're crossing the line.

433
00:22:30,905 --> 00:22:32,739
Even though you're a customer here,

434
00:22:32,740 --> 00:22:34,825
you have no right to disrespect me like this.

435
00:22:35,242 --> 00:22:36,409
Why? Who do you think you are?!

436
00:22:36,410 --> 00:22:38,245
You're nothing but a dumb server!

437
00:22:38,913 --> 00:22:39,622
Million.

438
00:22:39,914 --> 00:22:40,581
15?

439
00:22:41,332 --> 00:22:43,666
Oh, without the equipments?

440
00:22:43,667 --> 00:22:44,667
I'll talk to you later, alright?

441
00:22:44,668 --> 00:22:45,252
I'll be quick.

442
00:22:45,253 --> 00:22:46,462
Alright. Okay, okay, okay.

443
00:22:46,921 --> 00:22:49,548
(Suspenseful music playing)

444
00:23:07,608 --> 00:23:08,609
You jerk!

445
00:23:09,068 --> 00:23:09,944
What's this?!

446
00:23:10,069 --> 00:23:11,695
Why are there videos of me like these, Zach?!

447
00:23:12,446 --> 00:23:13,863
Those videos.

448
00:23:13,864 --> 00:23:14,906
Why do you have these?

449
00:23:14,907 --> 00:23:15,825
I'm deleting these right now!

450
00:23:15,826 --> 00:23:18,619
This is a violation of my privacy!

451
00:23:18,994 --> 00:23:19,954
Delete it now!

452
00:23:19,955 --> 00:23:21,205
Delete those videos right now.

453
00:23:21,747 --> 00:23:23,374
Or else what?

454
00:23:23,874 --> 00:23:24,750
- Huh?
- I'm going to report you.

455
00:23:24,751 --> 00:23:26,209
I'll call the police on you!

456
00:23:26,210 --> 00:23:27,086
You're going to report me?

457
00:23:27,086 --> 00:23:28,003
You're reporting me?

458
00:23:28,004 --> 00:23:29,420
Yes! I will report you!

459
00:23:29,421 --> 00:23:31,966
Fine, report me to the police then!

460
00:23:32,258 --> 00:23:33,509
Let them have a look.

461
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,638
I wonder how your family is going to react.

462
00:23:38,222 --> 00:23:41,350
And your fiancé once they find out about this.

463
00:23:42,268 --> 00:23:42,893
Zach!

464
00:23:42,894 --> 00:23:44,145
Zach please delete them!

465
00:23:44,270 --> 00:23:45,020
No!

466
00:23:45,271 --> 00:23:45,855
(Grunts)

467
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:47,398
Delete it!

468
00:23:47,399 --> 00:23:48,774
Delete those, Zach!

469
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:51,152
Delete those right now!

470
00:23:52,444 --> 00:23:53,279
You won't get this.

471
00:23:54,697 --> 00:23:55,364
(Grunts)

472
00:23:56,115 --> 00:23:57,032
Stop it.

473
00:23:57,032 --> 00:23:57,616
Please.

474
00:23:58,993 --> 00:23:59,618
Zach, please!

475
00:23:59,618 --> 00:24:00,578
Think about my situation.

476
00:24:00,953 --> 00:24:02,162
I don't feel sorry for you.

477
00:24:02,163 --> 00:24:03,580
Zach, please delete it already.

478
00:24:03,581 --> 00:24:05,456
Please, please, please, Zach.
I'm begging you.

479
00:24:05,457 --> 00:24:06,625
Delete it right now.

480
00:24:06,792 --> 00:24:08,460
Please, please.
No. Please.

481
00:24:08,502 --> 00:24:09,086
No!

482
00:24:11,172 --> 00:24:11,547
(Grunts in frustration)

483
00:24:22,325 --> 00:24:23,827
(Screams in agony)

484
00:24:26,848 --> 00:24:28,350
He's not my friend!

485
00:24:29,017 --> 00:24:30,810
He was just my sister's boyfriend,

486
00:24:31,019 --> 00:24:32,771
and my fiancé's business partner.

487
00:24:33,021 --> 00:24:34,147
Nothing more to it!

488
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:42,822
(Clears throat)

489
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:45,951
He's not my friend.

490
00:24:47,452 --> 00:24:49,788
You know what, I have more
important things to do

491
00:24:50,205 --> 00:24:53,333
than help you solve this stupid crime!

492
00:25:05,303 --> 00:25:07,680
I really don't know what happened, Inspector.

493
00:25:07,681 --> 00:25:11,184
But if the fire intentional,
they should be held accountable.

494
00:25:11,393 --> 00:25:12,769
Why is Zach calling you?

495
00:25:12,894 --> 00:25:15,270
No, he's just consulting
a contract with me.

496
00:25:15,271 --> 00:25:16,605
He's just asking for my advice.

497
00:25:16,606 --> 00:25:17,482
(Giggles nervously)

498
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:19,608
Yana, just be careful with him, okay?

499
00:25:19,609 --> 00:25:21,151
I want my money back!

500
00:25:21,152 --> 00:25:24,197
I don't care how you will pay me!

501
00:25:24,364 --> 00:25:26,324
I don't care if you have to sell your kidney!

502
00:25:26,491 --> 00:25:28,868
Well, I'm happy that Yana
is here with us now.

503
00:25:29,077 --> 00:25:30,536
We'll be able to take care of her.

504
00:25:30,537 --> 00:25:31,705
We need to protect her.

505
00:25:31,955 --> 00:25:33,915
Where's my money?

506
00:25:34,708 --> 00:25:36,835
I'm sure you'll take me seriously now.
