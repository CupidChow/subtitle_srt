[JIGGER] What?

547
00:27:01,828 --> 00:27:02,370
[JIGGER] What?

548
00:27:03,204 --> 00:27:04,539
Will you give my money?

549
00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,333
Or should I unload this
entire clip on you?!

550
00:27:08,168 --> 00:27:09,002
[JIGGER] What, huh?

551
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:11,129
Are you just going to stare?

552
00:27:11,671 --> 00:27:13,923
Or are you going to do something
about my missing money?

553
00:27:15,175 --> 00:27:16,343
You damn rich people.

554
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:17,969
You act like you're something special.

555
00:27:19,638 --> 00:27:20,930
You like to belittle us.

556
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:23,642
You think you're better than the poor?

557
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:25,685
Do you think you're God?

558
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:27,145
What, huh?!

559
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:29,773
Where's your attitude now?

560
00:27:31,566 --> 00:27:33,068
Where’s my money?

561
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:38,490
Be satisfied with whatever I give you!

562
00:27:38,782 --> 00:27:40,533
Don’t tell me what to do!

563
00:27:40,617 --> 00:27:41,368

[AMELIE] She killed him!

00:28:04,307 --> 00:28:05,183
Amelie?

575
00:28:18,697 --> 00:28:21,408
[AMELIE VOICEOVER] Now that I know
what kind of mother I really have,

576
00:28:21,408 --> 00:28:23,284
I’m scared now to face the truth,

577
00:28:23,284 --> 00:28:26,079
knowing she’s the reflection of my future.

578
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:32,001
Talk to the inspector about my case.

579
00:28:32,419 --> 00:28:34,587
Tell her to look really closely into this.

580
00:28:34,796 --> 00:28:38,550
The results came back for
the fingerprint analysis we did.

581
00:28:38,675 --> 00:28:42,429
We finally found out whose
fingerprints are on the paraphernalia.

582
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:45,473
Whose fingerprints were on there?

583
00:28:45,473 --> 00:28:46,933
It was Jigger Mendoza.

584
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:48,560
Isn’t he your supervisor at the gym?

585
00:28:48,560 --> 00:28:51,020
He was found unconscious and bleeding.

586
00:28:52,522 --> 00:28:54,315
So this is where Hector is hiding.

587
00:28:55,191 --> 00:28:56,151
Jackpot!

588
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:58,403
What happened to you?

589
00:28:58,778 --> 00:28:59,738
Marga.

590
00:29:01,781 --> 00:29:03,241
Are you talking about Ma’am Marga?
