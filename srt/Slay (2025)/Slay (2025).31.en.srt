Soon after, Byron died.

359
00:18:27,611 --> 00:18:29,655
His death was suspicious.

360
00:18:31,115 --> 00:18:31,907
Jigger,

361
00:18:33,325 --> 00:18:36,662
you need to tell the police
what you witnessed.

362
00:18:39,790 --> 00:18:41,416
Aside from witnessing the confrontation between

363
00:18:41,417 --> 00:18:43,711
Byron Alvarez and Hector Baltazar,

364
00:18:44,586 --> 00:18:46,672
did you notice anything
else that was suspicious?

365
00:18:49,883 --> 00:18:50,551
Go ahead.

366
00:18:50,551 --> 00:18:51,385
Don’t be afraid.

367
00:18:51,802 --> 00:18:53,095
Tell them what you know.

368
00:18:55,639 --> 00:18:56,806
[INHALES SHARPLY]

369
00:18:56,807 --> 00:19:01,770
I remember about one week after
they had the confrontation,

370
00:19:02,688 --> 00:19:06,400
I saw Sir Hector in the gym’s locker room.

371
00:19:07,234 --> 00:19:14,575
He was fixing some injections and
some medicines in bottles.

372
00:19:15,784 --> 00:19:17,035
It looked like steroids.

373
00:19:18,954 --> 00:19:21,540
But I had no idea what
he did with them.

374
00:19:35,345 --> 00:19:38,098
Sir Jigger, I just want to-

375
00:19:38,515 --> 00:19:42,728
I apologize for disturbing
you but I just want to ask

376
00:19:43,604 --> 00:19:47,107
if you remember that my brother was once
a trainer here as his side job?

377
00:19:48,734 --> 00:19:49,568
Byron?

378
00:19:49,568 --> 00:19:50,444
Yes.

379
00:19:50,986 --> 00:19:51,612
Yes.

380
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:52,863
Why?

381
00:19:53,113 --> 00:19:55,741
Was Ma’am Marga one of his clients before?

382
00:19:56,492 --> 00:19:57,826
Amelie’s mom?

383
00:19:59,828 --> 00:20:03,582
Uhh. I'm not sure.

384
00:20:05,876 --> 00:20:06,752
Alright.

385
00:20:11,965 --> 00:20:16,428
Sir, we have a warrant to
search your premises.

386
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:19,097
Take me to Hector Baltazar’s locker.

387
00:20:20,015 --> 00:20:21,016
Sir Hector?

388
00:20:21,642 --> 00:20:22,392
What for?

389
00:20:23,018 --> 00:20:28,524
We received a tip that he had something
to do with Byron Alvarez’s murder.

390
00:20:29,691 --> 00:20:30,651
Let’s go to the locker room.

391
00:20:51,130 --> 00:20:53,340
I've been waiting for
you since yesterday.

392
00:20:54,091 --> 00:20:55,509
I was supposed to tell you something.

393
00:20:56,927 --> 00:20:57,803
Sorry, ma’am.

394
00:20:58,595 --> 00:21:00,848
Chief assigned me to another case.

395
00:21:01,807 --> 00:21:05,769
They were understaffed and that
case is about pedophilia.

396
00:21:06,562 --> 00:21:07,604
Do your best out there.

397
00:21:07,980 --> 00:21:10,524
Make sure those animals end up behind bars.

398
00:21:10,774 --> 00:21:14,945
And don’t you dare mess this up
like you did with my case.

399
00:21:15,279 --> 00:21:16,113
Yes, ma’am.

400
00:21:17,364 --> 00:21:19,658
Ma’am. I am really sorry.

401
00:21:19,908 --> 00:21:21,702
I got carried away by my
emotions during that time.

402
00:21:22,452 --> 00:21:25,080
I really thought Yana poisoned you.

403
00:21:26,331 --> 00:21:27,124
It won’t happen again.

404
00:21:27,374 --> 00:21:28,834
Hmm.
Just keep quiet already.

405
00:21:31,211 --> 00:21:33,630
What were you about to tell me?

406
00:21:33,672 --> 00:21:41,388
Yana told me that their
eye drops came from Liv.

407
00:21:43,599 --> 00:21:49,229
And I have a new theory
about Zach’s murderer.

[SUGAR] Wait.

412
00:22:05,787 --> 00:22:06,663
[SUGAR] Wait.

413
00:22:06,663 --> 00:22:07,414
[POLICEMAN 1] What do you mean "wait?"

414
00:22:07,414 --> 00:22:08,040
Hold on.

00:22:08,582 --> 00:22:09,666
- [SUGAR] Wait.
- Hey! What are you doing?

416
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:11,710
I’m Byron’s sister!

417
00:22:12,002 --> 00:22:15,547
I have the right to know what’s happening here.

418
00:22:18,634 --> 00:22:20,385
Sir Hector’s not answering the call.

419

We have a warrant.

420
00:22:22,554 --> 00:22:24,181
We can open that locker without him.

421
00:22:24,473 --> 00:22:25,140
Go ahead and open it.

422
00:22:37,319 --> 00:22:38,612
Are those steroids? [SOBS]

423
00:22:40,364 --> 00:22:42,907
Didn’t your brother die because
of a steroid overdose?

424
00:22:42,908 --> 00:22:43,533
What?

425
00:22:43,534 --> 00:22:44,785
It’s possible that he
didn’t do that to himself.

426
00:22:45,243 --> 00:22:46,620
There could be foul play in the case.

427
00:22:46,828 --> 00:22:48,080
Huh? [SUGAR SOBS]

[AMELIE VOICEOVER] There are
many ways to hide the truth.

But one thing is almost certain.

No matter how much you hide it,
the truth will always come out.

Why did you rush home, dear?

00:23:33,792 --> 00:23:36,086
I found Byron’s killer.

This is just what we need,
so Sugar gets mad at Liv.

Wait. What eye drops
is she talking about?

436
00:23:42,759 --> 00:23:45,637
Zach didn’t die because he was burned.

437
00:23:46,555 --> 00:23:48,807
He was poisoned using eye drops.

438
00:23:49,099 --> 00:23:52,310
Because someone is trying
to set up the three of you.
