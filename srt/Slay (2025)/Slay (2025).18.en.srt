00:00:09,884 --> 00:00:11,260
I got bored of our relationship.

3
00:00:11,261 --> 00:00:14,472
I wanted to experiment. I wanted to have fun.

4
00:00:15,306 --> 00:00:16,725
That's where Zach came in.

5
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:19,727
Zach filmed videos without Amelie's knowledge.

6
00:00:19,728 --> 00:00:20,770
A hidden camera?

7
00:00:21,104 --> 00:00:22,605
I couldn't believe it either, Godfather.

8
00:00:22,647 --> 00:00:25,400
It's one thing if your partner agrees to be filmed.

9
00:00:25,817 --> 00:00:28,028
But to film her without her knowledge?

10
00:00:28,111 --> 00:00:28,737
That's a crime!

12

Yeah.

13
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:34,116
I just didn't say it because I know
you and Luke were broken up.

14

And I just thought to myself,
that you're a grown woman, you know?

15
00:00:37,078 --> 00:00:39,706
There isn't anything wrong if
you and Zach flirted with each other.

There's something you need to see.

to exchange clothes with.

Your imagination is wild.

718
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:15,952
That's why you took some tea tree oil.

719
00:33:15,994 --> 00:33:19,163
You switched it with the body oil that he uses.

720
00:33:19,831 --> 00:33:21,416
And you tampered with the lighter.

721
00:33:21,833 --> 00:33:22,792

I have nothing to do with that lighter.

725
00:33:26,421 --> 00:33:28,381
And that tea tree oil doesn't belong to me.

726
00:33:28,756 --> 00:33:30,675
If it isn't yours, then whose is it?

727

Whose is it?

00:33:33,344 --> 00:33:34,303
Ms. Baltazar.

Huh?

731
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,267
Because you're lying.

No!

733
00:33:40,184 --> 00:33:41,144
Just admit it.

734
00:33:41,936 --> 00:33:44,605
That the tea tree oil used to burn
the victim came from you.

have been removed from the Internet.
