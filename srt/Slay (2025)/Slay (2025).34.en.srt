00:08:15,453 --> 00:08:16,204
Liv.

185
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:18,789
You can talk to the inspector
handling my case.

186
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:20,791
Ask them

187
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:22,460
[HECTOR] to investigate further.

188
00:08:23,085 --> 00:08:27,882
My fingerprints are not present in the
paraphernalia they got from my locker.

189
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,717
Because I did not touch those things.

190
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:32,803
Alright, Dad.
Okay.

191
00:08:37,058 --> 00:08:39,227
Last stop. Let’s go!

192
00:08:40,770 --> 00:08:41,687
Someone’s there.

193
00:08:43,064 --> 00:08:44,064
There’s blood!

194
00:08:44,065 --> 00:08:45,358
Hey! Don’t approach!

195
00:08:46,901 --> 00:08:49,153
There’s blood! Someone call for an ambulance!

196
00:08:52,156 --> 00:08:53,366
[LOURDES] Sugar?

197
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:56,117
I already bought groceries,

198
00:08:56,118 --> 00:08:57,827
and also some of your snacks.

199
00:08:57,828 --> 00:08:59,287
Wow! Thank you, dear.

200
00:08:59,288 --> 00:09:00,498
How have you been?

201
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:03,876
- Mom.
- Oh?

202
00:09:04,460 --> 00:09:06,503
When you go back
home to the province,

203
00:09:06,504 --> 00:09:10,841
please explain to Kiko why
I can't go home yet.

204
00:09:11,217 --> 00:09:13,427
With everything that's going on with Liv,

205
00:09:13,469 --> 00:09:15,345
and with my job-

206
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,888
Come here, Sugar.

207
00:09:16,889 --> 00:09:19,308
It's a good thing that you work hard,

208
00:09:19,850 --> 00:09:23,770
but don't forget to relax.

209
00:09:23,771 --> 00:09:25,648
I have an idea.

210
00:09:27,191 --> 00:09:28,525
[SUGAR] What are you up to, Mom?

211
00:09:28,526 --> 00:09:30,570
Hold on.

212
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:36,032
What if we do what we used to do?

213
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,076
I think I know what you're talking about.

214
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:38,368
We used to watch movies-

215
00:09:38,369 --> 00:09:39,786
Movies! Yes!

216
00:09:39,787 --> 00:09:41,247
Okay then, but,

217
00:09:41,539 --> 00:09:42,582
I want to watch horror!

218
00:09:43,165 --> 00:09:45,334
I want to watch something to make me giddy!

219
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:47,335
Okay, alright then!

220
00:09:47,336 --> 00:09:48,336
I'll go ahead and pick.

221
00:09:48,337 --> 00:09:49,255
Okay, okay.

222
00:09:49,256 --> 00:09:51,799
Here! My friend told me this is good.

223
00:09:53,384 --> 00:09:55,219
I think you're forgetting something, Mom.

224
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:56,345
Huh?

225
00:09:56,887 --> 00:09:58,014
This is incomplete!

226
00:10:01,058 --> 00:10:02,018
[LOURDES] I almost forgot!

227
00:10:03,311 --> 00:10:04,770
- Here.
- Ohh!

228
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:15,948
Thanks for letting me choose.

229
00:10:16,324 --> 00:10:17,992
I should be the one
thanking you, Mom.

230
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:20,577
At least I got to enjoy
my rest day, right?

231
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,495
Yes! And I got to spend it with you!

232
00:10:22,496 --> 00:10:23,538
- Right?
- That's true!

233
00:10:23,539 --> 00:10:24,332
Isn't it cool, Mom?

234
00:10:24,582 --> 00:10:25,166
Hmm?

235
00:10:25,167 --> 00:10:28,835
There are some things
we never get tired of.

236
00:10:28,836 --> 00:10:30,129
Like us bonding!

237
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:32,757
Yes.

238
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,220
Inspector.

239
00:10:38,512 --> 00:10:40,723
I was able contact my dad.

240
00:10:42,391 --> 00:10:43,851
Did he tell you where he is?

241
00:10:45,061 --> 00:10:46,520
No. He didn’t tell me.

242
00:10:46,687 --> 00:10:49,315
We only talked for a short time,
then the line was cut.

243
00:10:49,774 --> 00:10:52,902
But he asked me to do something.

244
00:10:54,737 --> 00:10:56,238
He said he’s innocent.

245
00:10:56,572 --> 00:10:58,032
And that he was being framed up.

246
00:10:59,659 --> 00:11:00,868
And I believe him.

247
00:11:01,202 --> 00:11:02,953
It's expected for you to say that.

248
00:11:03,371 --> 00:11:04,622
Of course, he’s your dad.

249
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,540
Uhm. The…

250
00:11:07,708 --> 00:11:12,588
Please check the fingerprints on
the evidence you gathered.

251
00:11:13,047 --> 00:11:14,090
Here.

252
00:11:15,216 --> 00:11:20,888
Here’s a copy of the ID
with my father’s fingerprint.

253
00:11:21,222 --> 00:11:25,767
Please compare that to the fingerprint
found in the paraphernalia.

254
00:11:25,768 --> 00:11:29,897
That will prove that my dad is
innocent of the accusations.

255
00:11:31,190 --> 00:11:32,399
Thank you, Miss Baltazar.

256
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,527
But even before you arrived,

257
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:39,031
the result already came out for
the requested fingerprint analysis.

258
00:11:39,407 --> 00:11:43,077
We confirmed whose fingerprints
were found on the paraphernalia.

259
00:11:43,953 --> 00:11:47,081
So whose fingerprints are those?

260
00:11:48,541 --> 00:11:49,375
It’s your dad’s.

261
00:11:49,792 --> 00:11:51,001
They belong to Hector Baltazar.

262
00:12:19,405 --> 00:12:21,824
The money that was found at the
crime scene has been checked.

263
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:24,577
Only Mendoza’s fingerprints were found.

264
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:28,038
It’s possible that the assailant was wearing gloves.

265
00:12:29,498 --> 00:12:30,166
What does that mean?

266
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:32,293
Robbery but they left behind the money?

267
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:36,714
Or maybe a double-crossing took place?

268
00:12:37,548 --> 00:12:38,966
Which led to Mendoza being killed?

269
00:12:41,427 --> 00:12:43,554
If he doesn't survive this operation,

270
00:12:44,555 --> 00:12:49,685
he will be the third murder victim
who's connected to the gym.

271
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:55,024
Inspector Catapang mentioned that there’s
no such thing as coincidence.

272
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:57,901
Just unsolved mysteries.

273
00:12:57,902 --> 00:12:58,486
Hmm.

274
00:12:59,862 --> 00:13:02,239
Don’t you think all of these
killings are connected?

275
00:13:03,741 --> 00:13:04,867
Byron Alvarez.

276
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:06,160
Zach Zamora.

00:13:07,536 --> 00:13:08,454
Jigger Mendoza.

278
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:15,336
Hector Baltazar got jealous of Byron Alvarez.

279
00:13:15,544 --> 00:13:16,253
He killed him.

280
00:13:17,046 --> 00:13:19,215
Zach cheated on Liv.

281
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:20,508
He killed him.

282
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,510
How about this one?

283
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:26,847
What do you think his offense could be?

284
00:13:33,521 --> 00:13:36,482
Hector. This is Attorney Silverio.

285
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:37,191
Hello.

286
00:13:37,191 --> 00:13:37,858
Attorney.

287
00:13:38,108 --> 00:13:38,734
Have a seat.

288
00:13:39,401 --> 00:13:41,737
Alfred already told me about your problem.

289
00:13:44,406 --> 00:13:45,282
I will help you.

290
00:13:46,867 --> 00:13:48,577
We will talk to the authorities.

291
00:13:50,538 --> 00:13:51,205
What?

292
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:52,665
I need to surrender?

293
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:53,249
Yes.

294
00:13:53,249 --> 00:13:54,208
Attorney, I don’t want to go to jail.

295
00:13:54,625 --> 00:13:55,626
We can post bail.

296
00:13:56,043 --> 00:13:58,003
Just like you said, you were
only framed, right?

297
00:13:58,754 --> 00:14:02,842
It’s better to talk and cooperate than to keep hiding.

298
00:14:04,093 --> 00:14:05,010
Just trust the process.

299
00:14:05,511 --> 00:14:06,679
Attorney Silverio is great at what he does.

300
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:09,306
But first, we need to talk to your family.

301

302
00:14:20,067 --> 00:14:21,944
I’m happy to see you both again.

303
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,948
[HECTOR] I thought I would just
be hiding away for life.

304
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:30,828
But Attorney Silverio promised
that he would help fix this.

305
00:14:30,953 --> 00:14:31,996
He will help me.

306
00:14:32,830 --> 00:14:34,248
We can all be together again.

307
00:14:36,792 --> 00:14:37,543
Where, Dad?

308
00:14:39,253 --> 00:14:40,963
At the jail’s visitors’ area?

309
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,300
Liv. Stop being a pessimist.

310
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:49,054
Miss Baltazar, your father said he is innocent.

311
00:14:49,972 --> 00:14:52,391
It seems he also convinced
you to believe his lies.

312
00:14:53,517 --> 00:14:54,767
Liv, what’s the problem?

313
00:14:54,768 --> 00:14:55,477

314
00:14:57,062 --> 00:14:57,605

315
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:00,733
Do you believe their false
accusations against me?

316
00:15:01,817 --> 00:15:03,402
Don’t you trust your dad?

317
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:04,862
I do, Dad.

318
00:15:05,529 --> 00:15:06,238
I trust you.

319
00:15:08,032 --> 00:15:10,075
I even followed your advice.

320
00:15:11,785 --> 00:15:15,623
I had the evidence checked for your fingerprints.

321
00:15:16,999 --> 00:15:17,583
Dad.

322
00:15:19,043 --> 00:15:21,003
The fingerprints they found were all yours.

323
00:15:21,170 --> 00:15:22,296
That’s impossible!

324
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:25,299
The results of the lab report came out.

325
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:30,095
Your fingerprints are all over the evidence.

326
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:32,138

on the plastic sachet.

329
00:15:37,269 --> 00:15:38,812
They are probably mistaken.

330
00:15:39,229 --> 00:15:42,524
Maybe they are working
with the one trying to frame me.

331
00:15:43,484 --> 00:15:44,485
They’re just trying to pin it on me.

332
00:15:45,527 --> 00:15:47,279
Why would they pin it on you?

333
00:15:47,947 --> 00:15:49,740
Who did you mess with?

334
00:15:50,074 --> 00:15:51,158
I have no idea!

00:15:52,326 --> 00:15:53,285
You have no idea?

336
00:15:54,370 --> 00:15:59,375
Or maybe you’re just pretending you
don’t know so we can protect you?

I didn't kill Byron.

I didn't kill anybody.
