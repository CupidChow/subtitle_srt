00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,385
[DEBBIE] They’re already struggling.

537
00:21:02,386 --> 00:21:04,721
No surprise, especially with
Uncle Charlie’s gambling habit.

538
00:21:04,972 --> 00:21:07,598
It’s no wonder Yana’s always borrowing money.

539
00:21:07,599 --> 00:21:09,308
Dad, I can’t stay here, okay?

540
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,145
Maybe… maybe you can send me some money.

541
00:21:13,522 --> 00:21:15,023
Come on, get inside.

542
00:21:15,399 --> 00:21:17,401
Where are you?
Why do I hear “Cubao?”

543
00:21:17,776 --> 00:21:19,111
You kicked Yana out?

544
00:21:19,486 --> 00:21:20,153
But why?

545
00:21:20,153 --> 00:21:20,988
Someone came to our house,

546
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:22,698
screaming, demanding
Yana to pay her back.

547
00:21:23,407 --> 00:21:25,158
Apparently, Yana’s got money problems.

548
00:21:25,367 --> 00:21:27,244
We’re going to invite you to
the precinct for questioning.

549
00:21:27,369 --> 00:21:29,663
We found some information that
gives us enough reason

550
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:34,251
to believe you had a motive
to kill Zach Zamora.
