357
00:17:45,898 --> 00:17:47,191
That was you, Amelie?

358
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,444
You had a relationship with my brother?

359
00:17:51,612 --> 00:17:53,280
What do you know about his death?

360
00:17:54,531 --> 00:17:55,491
Huh?

361
00:17:55,991 --> 00:17:58,577
This is the bracelet, I’m sure.
What do you know about my brother?

362
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:00,995
What the hell, Sugar?

363
00:18:00,996 --> 00:18:02,081
What are you talking about?

364
00:18:02,456 --> 00:18:05,876
My gosh, why do you think
I would care about your brother?

365
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:09,338
I barely even noticed your brother.

366
00:18:09,963 --> 00:18:13,925
And if my bracelet is
your only basis, my goodness.

367
00:18:13,926 --> 00:18:15,886
Go to the freaking jewelry shop.

368
00:18:16,136 --> 00:18:17,513
It’s not the only one.

00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,138
[EXASPERATED SIGH]
My God.

370
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:20,306
Sugar.

371
00:18:20,307 --> 00:18:22,226
What a stupid accusation.

372
00:18:28,190 --> 00:18:30,109
Let them post bail.

373
00:18:30,859 --> 00:18:33,695
They’ll all go back to jail anyway,
due to Yana’s testimony.

374
00:18:34,613 --> 00:18:39,159
I also have full trust in you,
Inspector Dimaunahan.

375
00:18:45,457 --> 00:18:50,838
Mr. Zamora, steroids were not
found in Zach’s autopsy.

376
00:18:51,880 --> 00:18:54,967
[CHUCKLES] I knew it.

377
00:18:56,301 --> 00:18:57,636
My son is clean.

378
00:18:58,637 --> 00:19:01,140
The jealous ones just made
a rumor out of it.

379
00:19:01,557 --> 00:19:04,309
However, Mr. Zamora,
we have cause for concern.

380
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:07,271
Tetrahydrozoline was found in Zach’s body.

381
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:09,648
What’s that?

382
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:12,317
It’s an active ingredient
found in eye drops.

383
00:19:12,734 --> 00:19:15,027
It can be seen in the body
when it’s ingested.

384
00:19:15,028 --> 00:19:17,489
Which means he drank it.

385
00:19:18,323 --> 00:19:19,782
Is that a problem?

386
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:22,119
Eye drops are toxic, Mr. Zamora.

387
00:19:22,828 --> 00:19:26,664
So, it’s either he intentionally ingested it,

388
00:19:26,665 --> 00:19:28,292
or somebody poisoned him.

389
00:19:41,930 --> 00:19:45,893
[SUGAR VOICEOVER] Do we really know the
people who matter to us?

390
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:53,192
Or do we all have deadly secrets
we're trying to keep?

[LIV SIGHS]

392
00:20:08,540 --> 00:20:12,127
The leftover water in the bottle turned out
positive with tetrahydrozoline.

393
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:18,090
Somebody put some eyedrops in
Zach Zamora’s water bottle.

394
00:20:18,091 --> 00:20:19,717
Ma’am, let’s go and find those four women.

395
00:20:19,718 --> 00:20:21,594
So they will know we already know what they did.

396
00:20:21,595 --> 00:20:22,387
No, no, no.

397
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:25,014
We will entrap them once again.

398
00:20:25,015 --> 00:20:27,016
I’m giving you a chance

399
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,435
to confess to your crime.

400
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:31,396
Stop playing innocent.

401
00:20:31,813 --> 00:20:39,529
I have circumstantial evidence that
points to you as Zach’s real killer.

402
00:20:39,655 --> 00:20:41,364
I was also Byron’s friend.

403
00:20:41,365 --> 00:20:45,911
I just want to know if you think Sir Hector
had something to do with his death.
