Hold on.

357
00:18:08,699 --> 00:18:11,076
You can't just arrest
people like this!

358
00:18:11,118 --> 00:18:12,411
You have the right to remain silent.

359
00:18:12,452 --> 00:18:14,788
- Anything you say can be used against you-
- Hold on, let's talk about this.

360
00:18:14,830 --> 00:18:16,289
- [INSPECTOR GEORGIA] in a court of law.
- [AMELIE] Dad, I don't want to go to jail!

361
00:18:16,331 --> 00:18:18,750
- [HECTOR] Hold on, let's talk about this.
- [INSPECTOR GEORGIA] You have the right to call an attorney.

362
00:18:18,792 --> 00:18:20,669
All right. I will call a lawyer.

363
00:18:20,961 --> 00:18:22,671
I'll call a lawyer first!
What's going on?

364
00:18:22,713 --> 00:18:24,840
This can't be!
Liv, help me!

365
00:18:25,090 --> 00:18:26,842
[INSPECTOR KIRBY] Alright.
We'll let you call a lawyer.

366
00:18:27,050 --> 00:18:27,592
Just come with us.

367
00:18:27,593 --> 00:18:29,344
Alright, let me call my lawyer!

368
00:18:29,469 --> 00:18:29,970
Let's go.

369
00:18:29,970 --> 00:18:30,929
Hold on, wait!
Wait!

370
00:18:30,929 --> 00:18:31,888
- [INSPECTOR GEORGIA] Sir,
- [HECTOR] Wait a minute!

371
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:32,931
[INSPECTOR GEORGIA] Let's just cooperate, sir.

372
00:18:32,973 --> 00:18:34,056
- [INSPECTOR GEORGIA] Let's just cooperate.
- [HECTOR] Don't you-

373
00:18:34,057 --> 00:18:35,392
-[HECTOR] Don't you touch my daughter
- [INSPECTOR GEORGIA] Let's just cooperate.

374
00:18:35,475 --> 00:18:36,934
[INSPECTOR GEORGIA] We have
a warrant, sir! Let's go!

375
00:18:36,935 --> 00:18:38,436
- [INSPECTOR GEORGIA] Let's go, let's go.
- [HECTOR] Wait. Dear!

376
00:18:38,437 --> 00:18:39,354
- [AMELIE] Mom!
- [HECTOR] You go with them, dear.

377
00:18:39,563 --> 00:18:40,105
[AMELIE] Mom!

378
00:18:40,147 --> 00:18:41,732
- [INSPECTOR GEORGIA] You can come by the precinct.
- [HECTOR] Be careful.

379
00:18:41,773 --> 00:18:43,316
You can now look for an attorney.

380
00:18:43,650 --> 00:18:44,818
- [INSPECTOR KIRBY] Let's go!
- [SUGAR] Hold on.

381
00:18:44,860 --> 00:18:45,569
Wait a minute.

382
00:18:46,486 --> 00:18:47,195
[LIV] Sugar!

383
00:18:48,864 --> 00:18:51,408
I won't talk to you until
my attorney gets here.

384
00:18:52,492 --> 00:18:53,702
My parents are also coming.

385
00:18:55,579 --> 00:18:57,664
Your arresting on what grounds?

386
00:18:58,331 --> 00:19:00,375
Yana told us that
you can't do this!

387
00:19:00,792 --> 00:19:03,795
You can't use the recording
of the four us talking!

388
00:19:04,171 --> 00:19:05,005
Us and Liv!

389
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:06,965
That's illegal!

390
00:19:07,424 --> 00:19:10,385
That goes against the Anti-Wiretapping Law!

391
00:19:10,594 --> 00:19:13,221
That's not the only evidence
we have against you!

392
00:19:14,014 --> 00:19:18,810
We have a statement corroborating
all of the circumstantial evidence

393
00:19:18,935 --> 00:19:21,188
surrounding your case!

394
00:19:21,813 --> 00:19:23,148
That's why we had you arrested!

395
00:19:23,774 --> 00:19:25,400
Statement? Excuse me!

396
00:19:26,193 --> 00:19:28,236
What statement?
From who?

397
00:19:35,660 --> 00:19:36,286
Yana!

398
00:19:38,538 --> 00:19:39,581
Did they arrest you too?

399
00:19:40,415 --> 00:19:41,249
Are you okay?

400
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:46,588
She doesn't have handcuffs on.

401
00:19:49,883 --> 00:19:51,343
Why aren't you in handcuffs?

402
00:19:54,846 --> 00:19:56,098
Mommy was right.

403
00:19:56,640 --> 00:19:58,558
It was true that you betrayed us!

404
00:19:58,725 --> 00:19:59,142
[AMELIE SCREAMS IN ANGER]

405
00:19:59,143 --> 00:20:01,102
What betrayal is your mother talking about?

406
00:20:01,103 --> 00:20:01,812
[SUGAR] What?!

407
00:20:01,813 --> 00:20:04,772
That we were harboring
traitors in our house!

408
00:20:04,773 --> 00:20:05,315
Huh?

409
00:20:05,398 --> 00:20:06,482
You have no shame, Yana!

410
00:20:06,483 --> 00:20:08,360
Don't speak ill about my father!

411
00:20:08,401 --> 00:20:11,987
Because I have more scandalous things
to reveal about your mother's wickedness!

412
00:20:11,988 --> 00:20:13,072
- You thought I didn't know?
- [AMELIE] What the hell are you talking about?!

413
00:20:13,073 --> 00:20:15,157
[AMELIE AND
YANA ARGUING]

414
00:20:15,158 --> 00:20:16,159
[INSPECTOR GEORGIA] That's enough!

415
00:20:16,201 --> 00:20:17,201
[AMELIE AND
YANA ARGUING]

416
00:20:17,202 --> 00:20:18,578
Hey, Yana! Stop that!

417
00:20:18,620 --> 00:20:19,745
[INSPECTOR GEORGIA]
Ladies, that's enough!

418
00:20:19,746 --> 00:20:20,997
What are you doing?!

419
00:20:21,164 --> 00:20:21,623
A...

420
00:20:22,124 --> 00:20:23,375
Inspector Manapat,

421
00:20:24,876 --> 00:20:26,461
please process these three women.

422
00:20:27,129 --> 00:20:28,130
Don't touch me.

423
00:21:21,725 --> 00:21:24,310
[YANA VOICEOVER] If your
treachery is the reason

424
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:26,646
for the downfall of
those you care for,

425
00:21:27,522 --> 00:21:30,775
is it worth crowning yourself the
smartest creature of them all?

426
00:21:47,918 --> 00:21:49,753
Stop playing coy!

427
00:21:49,836 --> 00:21:52,589
I know you have something to do
with what happened to Yana.

428
00:21:52,714 --> 00:21:55,634
Because you know that we're
cooperating with the police!

429
00:21:56,676 --> 00:21:58,845
I may have no proof
against the both of you,

430
00:21:58,887 --> 00:22:00,889
but at least I got to
bring you two down.

431
00:22:01,973 --> 00:22:05,100
I still got my revenge
on both of you!

432
00:22:05,101 --> 00:22:06,061
For what?

433
00:22:06,186 --> 00:22:08,103
We haven't done anything wrong to you!
[YANA SCREAMS]

434
00:22:08,104 --> 00:22:10,649
We found tetrahydrozoline
in Zach's body.

435
00:22:10,732 --> 00:22:12,776
Eye drops can be
poisonous, Mr. Zamora.

436
00:22:12,859 --> 00:22:15,528
Either, he drank it on purpose,

437
00:22:15,612 --> 00:22:17,989
or someone poisoned him.
