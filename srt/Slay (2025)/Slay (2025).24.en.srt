00:00:09,259 --> 00:00:12,302
If I were to represent you
you need to be honest with me.

3
00:00:12,303 --> 00:00:14,304
I only wanted to burn his office.

4
00:00:14,305 --> 00:00:16,640
[STUTTERING] I just wanted to buy
more time so

5
00:00:16,641 --> 00:00:18,476
that I could bring him
his money but...

[YANA CRYING]
[SUGAR] What's "F.O."-

00:00:52,135 --> 00:00:53,385
Friendship over!

[YANA BAWLING]
- [SUGAR] Sorry, sorry.

10
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:02,103
[SUGAR] This is my fault.

11
00:01:03,271 --> 00:01:05,356
I should have encouraged you to...

12
00:04:47,578 --> 00:04:49,872
I'm not going to allow you
to ruin our friendship.

13
00:04:51,207 --> 00:04:52,291
Come on, let's go.

17
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:07,432
Why, what's up?

18
00:05:08,057 --> 00:05:10,310
You don't eat fried fish anymore?

19
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:13,688
What else would you like?
I'll go buy some from the store.

It's not the fish, it-

22
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:18,609
It's you.

23
00:05:19,110 --> 00:05:20,069
What did I do wrong?

24
00:05:20,236 --> 00:05:22,029
[STUTTERING] I mean, sorry...

25
00:05:22,030 --> 00:05:24,032
[STUTTERING] I mean it's me.

26
00:05:25,033 --> 00:05:25,950
It's just...

27
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:28,703
I've been so bad to you before but...

28
00:05:28,911 --> 00:05:30,747
Until now, you're still here.

29
00:05:31,331 --> 00:05:32,623
Oh, it's nothing.

30
00:05:33,624 --> 00:05:35,752
And I understand you Yana.

31
00:05:36,461 --> 00:05:39,546

Why are you doing this?

36
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:52,226
Why are you being so kind to me?

37
00:05:53,144 --> 00:05:54,437
You really have to ask?

38
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,980
Of course, you're my friend!

39
00:05:56,647 --> 00:05:57,940
Just a friend, really?

40
00:05:59,317 --> 00:06:00,777
You might ask for something
in exchange later on.

41
00:06:01,736 --> 00:06:04,197
I might not be able to give
you what you want.

42
00:06:04,989 --> 00:06:07,283
Don't be silly. I'm not asking
anything in exchange.

43
00:06:10,578 --> 00:06:11,287
Thank you.

44
00:06:13,915 --> 00:06:15,541

I'm sorry if...

56
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:58,728
I was too harsh on you earlier.

00:07:59,187 --> 00:08:00,021
I'm sorry.

58
00:08:01,147 --> 00:08:02,440
You were harsh?

59
00:08:02,982 --> 00:08:05,151
Or you really did do
something wrong?

this is what I get?

00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:23,461
Shouldn't you instead be grateful
that I'm doing this for you?

Hello, uh, sir.

Who's the new investigator assigned
to Zach Zamora's case?

112
00:17:49,276 --> 00:17:51,779
It is Inspector Georgia Dimaunahan.

She's upstairs.

00:17:52,614 --> 00:17:53,989
Alright, thank you.

Kirby Manapat, ma'am.

117
00:18:07,544 --> 00:18:10,130
I am working on the case
with Inpector Juro Catapang.

00:18:12,549 --> 00:18:14,635
Well, I'm taking over.

119
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,846
I've already studied the report

120
00:18:18,097 --> 00:18:20,140
that you made about the case.

121
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:28,857
Let's see what we have here.

122
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:38,659
Yes, correct.

123
00:18:44,957 --> 00:18:46,625
Huh.

124
00:18:47,751 --> 00:18:50,963
Have you ever heard of the
"Triangle of Fire", Manapat?

125
00:18:51,588 --> 00:18:55,007
If one isn't present, then
there would be no fire.

126
00:18:55,008 --> 00:18:56,468
Exactly.

127
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,887
We've already established the ignition.

128
00:18:59,596 --> 00:19:01,181
Next, we have the fuel.

129
00:19:01,765 --> 00:19:04,059
And finally, oxygen.

130
00:19:04,685 --> 00:19:06,770
The fireworks powder.

00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:09,773
There you have it!

132
00:19:11,150 --> 00:19:13,485
There you have it, you can create fire!

133
00:19:25,414 --> 00:19:27,958
[KIRBY] So, what do you mean?

00:19:28,792 --> 00:19:30,294
Can you not see it?

00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,297
It has been here all along.

136
00:19:33,881 --> 00:19:35,799
Uh... What is?

137
00:19:36,466 --> 00:19:39,678
The victim's killer isn't a single person.

138
00:19:55,027 --> 00:19:59,114
to kill Zach Zamora.

139
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:05,369
This is why your investigation went astray.

140
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,872
Because you were focused
on one killer.

141
00:20:07,873 --> 00:20:09,374
When in fact...

142
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,001

00:20:11,710 --> 00:20:13,002
There are three.

144
00:20:13,003 --> 00:20:16,381
Zach Zamora has three killers.

145
00:20:17,382 --> 00:20:19,008
[AMELIE VOICEOVER] Three versus one.

146
00:20:19,009 --> 00:20:22,054
Three girls are now the
suspects of Zach's murder.

147
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:25,599
Will it also be three girls vs. Liv?

148
00:20:27,017 --> 00:20:29,435
I know you three very well!

149
00:20:29,436 --> 00:20:33,732
You three killed Zach Zamora.

You cheated on me with that woman!?

Wait until Amelie hears of this!

152
00:20:38,445 --> 00:20:41,907
She told me that all of those
contributed to burning Zach.

153
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:43,366
Tell me the truth.

154
00:20:43,367 --> 00:20:46,578
Individually you all have a
connection to burning Zach.

155
00:20:46,745 --> 00:20:50,040
You three, did you plan to kill Zach?
