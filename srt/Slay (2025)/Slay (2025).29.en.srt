This is ridiculous!

539
00:27:34,357 --> 00:27:35,858
You put us in jail!

540
00:27:35,984 --> 00:27:37,943
So it wasn't us that killed Zach.

541
00:27:37,944 --> 00:27:41,030
[STAMMERS] Just tell me how my boyfriend died.

542
00:27:41,447 --> 00:27:43,157
Stop playing dumb!

543
00:27:44,534 --> 00:27:46,869
I have incriminating evidence

544
00:27:48,079 --> 00:27:49,330
that points to you

545
00:27:51,332 --> 00:27:52,417
as Zach's

546
00:27:53,459 --> 00:27:54,669
real killer!
