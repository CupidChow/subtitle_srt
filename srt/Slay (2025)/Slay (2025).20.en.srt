544
00:24:50,606 --> 00:24:51,607
Alright, okay.

545
00:24:51,774 --> 00:24:56,237
Well, don't you worry, we have a
physical therapist slash trainer here.

546
00:24:57,029 --> 00:24:57,780
Wait.

547
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,781
Steve!

548
00:24:58,906 --> 00:24:59,490
Leonard?

549
00:24:59,491 --> 00:25:01,617
Can you please call Coach Beldon?

550
00:25:01,742 --> 00:25:03,536
Tell him I've got a client for him.

551
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:04,620
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

552
00:25:04,703 --> 00:25:05,830
Alright.

553
00:25:08,541 --> 00:25:09,458
[GROANS]

554
00:25:09,458 --> 00:25:10,334
- Bro?
- Mm?

555
00:25:12,169 --> 00:25:13,921
I think I know that girl.

556
00:25:14,296 --> 00:25:18,467
...Online harassment, the spread of sex
videos on the Internet.

557
00:25:19,051 --> 00:25:20,219
That girl.

558
00:25:21,804 --> 00:25:22,555
Yana?

559
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:24,849
I do not know her name.

560
00:25:26,225 --> 00:25:27,643
But I do know...

561
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,312
Days before Zach died,

562
00:25:31,647 --> 00:25:33,190
they fought.

563
00:25:33,899 --> 00:25:34,650
What?

564
00:25:38,404 --> 00:25:41,449
I was outside the bar one night,

565
00:25:42,366 --> 00:25:44,827
I saw Zach fighting with someone.

566
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:47,746
And it's that girl.

567
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:02,511
Zach?

568
00:26:08,976 --> 00:26:10,311
Where is my money?

569
00:26:10,394 --> 00:26:12,730
I'm still missing some of
the money I owe you but if you-

570
00:26:12,771 --> 00:26:13,814
Damn it, Yana!

571
00:26:14,815 --> 00:26:17,443
I just need time, I promise,
I will pay you back, okay?

572
00:26:17,485 --> 00:26:18,527
[BREATHING PANICALLY] I just-

573
00:26:19,612 --> 00:26:20,571
Just make sure of it.

574
00:26:22,156 --> 00:26:24,074
Otherwise, you won't just be buried in debt.

575
00:26:38,631 --> 00:26:41,342
Well then, let's see who'll get buried first.

576
00:26:41,383 --> 00:26:43,135
[YANA BREATHING DEEPLY]

577
00:26:43,552 --> 00:26:45,012
I must say...

578
00:26:46,680 --> 00:26:48,724
I was surprised with what Zach did.

579
00:26:49,308 --> 00:26:50,601
But that girl?

580
00:26:51,393 --> 00:26:52,853
Made a threat on him.

581
00:26:53,229 --> 00:26:53,979
What?

582
00:26:56,357 --> 00:26:57,483
Do you think

583
00:26:58,234 --> 00:27:00,486
that she had something to do with
what happened to your son?

584
00:27:04,949 --> 00:27:08,244
So that's all for today and
I'll keep you updated for more.

585
00:27:08,494 --> 00:27:09,370
- Bye guys!
- Hey Yana.

586
00:27:09,870 --> 00:27:10,621
Hi.

587
00:27:10,663 --> 00:27:11,205
Hi.

588
00:27:11,205 --> 00:27:12,122
You guys just got here?

589
00:27:12,248 --> 00:27:12,998
- [SUGAR] Mmm.
- [LIV] Yeah.

590
00:27:13,082 --> 00:27:14,249
Let's go workout?

591
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,000
Okay.

592
00:27:16,418 --> 00:27:17,169
Yana!

593
00:27:18,128 --> 00:27:18,879
Uncle Leonard?

594
00:27:19,046 --> 00:27:20,339
Did you and Zach fight?

595
00:27:22,007 --> 00:27:23,926
My friend saw you fighting.

596
00:27:24,343 --> 00:27:25,261
Was it about money?!

597
00:27:25,511 --> 00:27:26,971
Is that why you threatened him!?

598
00:27:27,096 --> 00:27:28,556
Did you kill my son!?

599
00:27:34,937 --> 00:27:36,564
[YANA VOICEOVER] I'm not a lawyer yet.

600
00:27:37,731 --> 00:27:40,693
It seems I'll be a suspect
before I become one.

601
00:27:41,277 --> 00:27:45,155
But I've always been fierce and
relentless in defending my friends.

602
00:27:45,864 --> 00:27:46,907
So...

603
00:27:47,324 --> 00:27:49,660
I'll just have to do the same for myself.

604
00:27:51,161 --> 00:27:52,496
[MARGA] Why are you causing a scandal?

605
00:27:52,538 --> 00:27:54,915
[WOMAN] Tell that woman to face me

606
00:27:54,957 --> 00:27:56,250
because she owes me money!

607
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,500
[WOMAN] Yana!

608
00:27:57,501 --> 00:27:59,837
So Yana Chua is now the suspect, partner?

609
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:01,087
Get a background check on her.

610
00:28:01,088 --> 00:28:03,591
If she really threatened Zach,
then she has motive.

611
00:28:03,716 --> 00:28:05,843
[MARGA ON PHONE] Oh, so you still don't know?

612
00:28:05,926 --> 00:28:10,306
Yana knew about Amelie and
your boyfriend's affair long ago.

613
00:28:10,431 --> 00:28:11,765
She hid it from you.

614
00:28:11,890 --> 00:28:13,183
And she hid it from us.

615
00:28:13,225 --> 00:28:15,686
What other secrets is that girl hiding?
