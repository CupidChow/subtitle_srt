And speaking of expensive watches,

92
00:05:19,902 --> 00:05:22,196
our question for today is…

93
00:05:22,697 --> 00:05:27,159
Is it illegal to buy fake luxury items?

94
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:29,870
Well, according to our law books,

95
00:05:29,871 --> 00:05:32,122
it is not illegal to wear knockoffs,

96
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:33,582
and buy knockoffs.

97
00:05:33,583 --> 00:05:35,876
What's illegal is if you sell those.

98
00:05:35,877 --> 00:05:37,419
So, if you are a seller,

99
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:39,212
a case can be filed against you.

100
00:05:39,213 --> 00:05:41,131
So it's not technically illegal,

101
00:05:41,132 --> 00:05:42,716
but in my opinion,

102
00:05:42,717 --> 00:05:46,011
I think that we should
just support original products.

103
00:05:46,012 --> 00:05:48,597
And I really don't believe that
we should be buying fake items,

104
00:05:48,598 --> 00:05:51,141
