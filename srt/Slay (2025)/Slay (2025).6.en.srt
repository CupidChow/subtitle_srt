The guy you sold the fake watch to.

722
00:34:16,228 --> 00:34:16,687
Why?

723
00:34:17,313 --> 00:34:18,898
Do you have anything to do with his death?

724
00:34:19,982 --> 00:34:23,569
Surely you didn’t kill him because he
was trying to collect payment, right?

725
00:34:25,404 --> 00:34:27,823
How can you be sure Zach’s
death was premeditated

726
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:29,492
and not an accident?

727
00:34:29,867 --> 00:34:31,744
I was able to piece together the killer’s plan.

728
00:34:32,662 --> 00:34:35,081
He tampered with the victim’s lighter.
