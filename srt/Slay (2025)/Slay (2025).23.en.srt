You put gunpowder in Zach Zamora's incense holder.

A sworn statement from your cousin, Debbie Tapanes.

150
00:07:17,186 --> 00:07:21,482
That proves that you stole fireworks gunpowder from their shop.

We'll respond to this affidavit

00:07:31,784 --> 00:07:33,326

denying Debbie Tapanes' accusation.

154
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,041
You put gunpowder in Zach's incense.

155
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,703
We had it checked at the lab.

156
00:07:42,003 --> 00:07:45,673
And it matched with the gunpowder that we found at the crime scene.

157
00:07:52,388 --> 00:07:53,388
What's that?

158
00:07:53,681 --> 00:07:54,432
That looks like...

159
00:07:54,557 --> 00:07:55,308
Gunpowder.

160
00:07:55,558 --> 00:07:56,958
Have this checked at the crime lab.

161
00:07:57,477 --> 00:07:59,228
But from the look and smell of it,

162
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:00,477
it's similar to gunpowder.

163
00:08:00,563 --> 00:08:02,607
Why would there be gunpowder inside the gym?

164
00:08:02,732 --> 00:08:03,732
Exactly.

165
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,861
That means, someone put this here.

Where is your evidence to support that?

Find the connection between the fireworks powder and my client.
