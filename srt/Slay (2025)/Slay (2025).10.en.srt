Its value will definitely
increase once I'm famous.

534
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:02,889
But I heard it'll be worth even more
with your signature on it.

535
00:28:03,306 --> 00:28:05,350
- Yeah, of course, no problem.
- Right? That's how it works, right?

537
00:28:24,452 --> 00:28:26,037
Byron, it's not true, right?

538
00:28:30,792 --> 00:28:32,043
You weren't an addict.

539
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,672
You weren't selling steroids.

540
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:39,050
We're not like that.

541
00:28:40,135 --> 00:28:41,428
We're not that kind of people.

542
00:28:43,888 --> 00:28:45,640
Do you think Jenny is telling the truth?

543
00:28:48,184 --> 00:28:50,061
We've established that she and
Sugar are know each other.

544
00:28:50,937 --> 00:28:53,773
Her expression clearly shows the trauma
of what she's been through.

545
00:28:55,024 --> 00:28:59,779
If she set Jenny on fire, there's a chance
she also did the same to Zach.

546
00:29:00,530 --> 00:29:02,824
Could it be that Sugar is an arsonist?

547
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,952
Catapang, you need to see this.

548
00:29:08,079 --> 00:29:09,456
Your bike is on fire!

549
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,583
My bike!

550
00:29:13,084 --> 00:29:14,460
Why are you all just
standing there?

551
00:29:14,461 --> 00:29:15,336
Get some water!

552
00:29:16,171 --> 00:29:16,755
Now!

00:29:39,652 --> 00:29:40,570
So, who's the girl?

556
00:29:41,529 --> 00:29:42,821
I don't know!

557
00:29:42,822 --> 00:29:43,323
But you know what?

558
00:29:43,324 --> 00:29:46,326
I think she knows Sugar because
she mentioned something.

559
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:51,414
She said, "Fire is Sugar's solution
to every problem."

[YANA SCOFFS]
How strange.

561
00:29:53,626 --> 00:29:55,084
I wonder what that means.

562
00:29:56,377 --> 00:29:57,545
You know what? I think...

563
00:29:58,546 --> 00:30:01,424
I think Sugar is an arsonist.

564
00:30:03,802 --> 00:30:05,220
Who could have done this?

565
00:30:05,887 --> 00:30:07,931
We just saw it on fire.

566
00:30:09,057 --> 00:30:12,602
But it seems like Kirby's
bike was their target.

567
00:30:13,311 --> 00:30:14,938
They didn't burn anything else but this.

568
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,816
I'm certain whoever did this
hasn't gone far yet.

569
00:30:19,150 --> 00:30:20,109
Team, search the area.

570
00:30:20,568 --> 00:30:21,110
Yes, sir.
Check carefully.

571
00:30:34,249 --> 00:30:34,958
Inspector, over here.

572
00:30:50,557 --> 00:30:53,017
Sir, I think this is what caused the fire.

573
00:30:57,647 --> 00:30:59,148
I recognize this blowtorch!

Cat and mouse is
the name of the game.

575
00:31:05,029 --> 00:31:08,658
And like all games,
the chase must end.

576
00:31:09,450 --> 00:31:13,162
The cat finds the mouse,
the detective catches the kill.

577
00:31:13,746 --> 00:31:16,082
The suspect faces justice.

578
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:24,173
Miss Sugar Alvarez was
caught by the CCTV.

00:31:24,591 --> 00:31:27,302
You were found at the crime scene
at the time of the fire.

You barely know this person!

You didn't even know she's
burned someone before!

Sugar's been manipulating you just
to get herself out of this!

If you don't wanna help her, it's fine.

But don't stop me from being
a true friend to her.

Can you talk to Liv?

587
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:46,988
Tell her that if she continues to help
Sugar, she'll get herself in trouble.

00:31:47,155 --> 00:31:47,989
Aren't you scared?
