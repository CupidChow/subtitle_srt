I wonder if Zach’s killer did it.

547
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,405
It’s possible, Godfather,

548
00:24:50,863 --> 00:24:53,408
but they might have done it just for fun too.

549
00:24:54,575 --> 00:24:56,661
Let’s focus on the evidence we have for now.

550
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,416
What’s this?

551
00:25:02,291 --> 00:25:06,629
We found pure, undiluted
tea tree oil on Zach’s skin,

552
00:25:07,004 --> 00:25:08,423
which is why he caught fire so quickly.

553
00:25:08,714 --> 00:25:11,968
I also checked the body oil bottle
we found among Zach’s things.

554
00:25:12,885 --> 00:25:14,429
It was pure tea tree oil.

555

But according to the label,

556
00:25:16,889 --> 00:25:18,266
it shouldn’t have been pure.

557
00:25:18,724 --> 00:25:20,560
It should’ve contained different ingredients.

We’re not sure, Godfather,
