00:26:21,746 --> 00:26:23,665
This is exactly why I've been bothering Yana.

537
00:26:24,124 --> 00:26:28,128
I wanted to ask her what on what should be done
when a person has a video recording of a crime.

538
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,683
But she's been ignoring me.

539
00:26:42,767 --> 00:26:46,187
Wait, so, you were able to record
the burning of the bike?

540
00:26:49,941 --> 00:26:52,193
When there is smoke,
there is fire.

541
00:26:52,569 --> 00:26:55,530
Got a secret, better
pray it stays hidden.

542
00:27:00,368 --> 00:27:02,829
And if you have ever committed a crime,

543
00:27:03,079 --> 00:27:05,832
Trust me, there is no escaping it.

544
00:27:06,541 --> 00:27:09,502
The truth always comes out.

545
00:27:09,878 --> 00:27:12,088
So—so, Emman was the one
who set the bike on fire?

546
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:18,927
It's clear from the security footage that you
set Inspector Kirby's bike on fire.

547
00:27:18,928 --> 00:27:20,012
- Come with us, let's go!
- Sir, hold on!

548
00:27:20,013 --> 00:27:20,472
Sir!

549
00:27:20,639 --> 00:27:22,765
You tampered the lighter that's
why a fire broke out.

550
00:27:22,766 --> 00:27:24,016
You killed Coach Zach!

551
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:24,726
Why?

552
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,062
You wanted revenge on Coach Zach?

553
00:27:27,312 --> 00:27:29,147
Because of what happened
to your brother, Byron?

554
00:27:29,564 --> 00:27:30,190
Hello?!
Who was that?

555
00:27:31,900 --> 00:27:33,692
A woman who wants to meet us,

556
00:27:33,693 --> 00:27:34,736
but she didn't introduce herself.

557
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:37,072
She said she knows something
about Coach Zach's killer.

558
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:39,616
[LIV] I will destroy you,

559
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:43,118
and I will make your life a living hell!

560
00:27:43,119 --> 00:27:44,328
I believe this is yours.

561
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:45,371
- "Where are you, dude?"
- "Dude, want to buy some steroids?

562
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:46,247
"I need the money for my girlfriend."

563
00:27:46,289 --> 00:27:47,456
My brother has a girlfriend?

564
00:27:47,457 --> 00:27:48,041
Inspector.

565
00:27:48,249 --> 00:27:50,209
We received a tip from a woman.

566
00:27:50,210 --> 00:27:52,754
She's saying she knows
who killed the victim.

567
00:27:53,004 --> 00:27:54,756
Do you know who it is?
