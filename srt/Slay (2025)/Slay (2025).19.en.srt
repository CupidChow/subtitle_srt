Can you just see me for who I am?

710
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:02,151
Accept me for who I am.

711
00:31:02,777 --> 00:31:04,487
Yes, you are my daughter.

712
00:31:04,779 --> 00:31:06,781
And I know what's best for you.

713
00:31:07,282 --> 00:31:08,741
That's why

714
00:31:09,325 --> 00:31:13,746
I don't tolerate weaknesses
and imperfections.

715
00:31:14,539 --> 00:31:16,165
And you know what, one day,

716
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,334
when you have a child of your own,

717
00:31:19,127 --> 00:31:21,379
you will understand what I'm saying.

718
00:31:22,088 --> 00:31:27,218
And you will learn to appreciate
everything that I did for you!

719
00:31:29,220 --> 00:31:32,015
[AMELIE SOBBING]

720
00:31:59,334 --> 00:32:00,959
[LIV] That was you in the video, right!?

721
00:32:00,960 --> 00:32:02,502
It's all over social media!

722
00:32:02,503 --> 00:32:03,963
[AMELIE] What!?

723
00:32:07,050 --> 00:32:08,509
What do you mean I won't stop?

724
00:32:09,010 --> 00:32:12,931
I saw my sister and my boyfriend!

725
00:32:13,222 --> 00:32:15,266
In bed, together!

726
00:32:16,643 --> 00:32:18,811
[MARGA] What are they going to
think of you now, huh?!

727
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,521
You are disgusting!

728
00:32:21,356 --> 00:32:23,441
You are so stupid!

729
00:32:24,317 --> 00:32:25,985
[ELIZA] The wedding is off!

730
00:32:26,694 --> 00:32:28,446
This is over!

731
00:32:30,531 --> 00:32:32,700
No, tell me, was it worth it!?

732
00:32:33,618 --> 00:32:35,912
The way you fooled me.

733
00:32:44,712 --> 00:32:46,589
[AMELIE] I'm sorry, universe.

734
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:51,302
I can't handle this anymore.

735
00:32:53,221 --> 00:32:56,057
[WATER SPLASHES]

736
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,704
Hey Yana, where is Amelie?

737
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,497
I'm worried for my sister!

738
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:21,708
[YANA CRYING] We're at the hospital right now.

739
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,127
So what, are you happy now?

740
00:33:24,627 --> 00:33:25,003
Huh?!

741
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:26,504
That this happened to your sister?

742
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:27,880
I do not know her name.

743
00:33:28,214 --> 00:33:31,551
But I know, days before Zach died,

744
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:32,884
they fought.

745
00:33:32,885 --> 00:33:33,720
[LEONARD] Yana!

746
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,429
Uncle Leonard?

747
00:33:34,637 --> 00:33:35,680
I heard that you and Zach fought?

748
00:33:35,847 --> 00:33:36,973
[LEONARD] Was it about money?

749
00:33:37,181 --> 00:33:38,307
Did you kill my son?!
