Why not?

537
00:27:59,302 --> 00:28:01,513
You don't want me to
embarass your mistress?

538
00:28:02,097 --> 00:28:04,724
[BETTY] Leona, do we need to call security?

539
00:28:05,392 --> 00:28:07,685
[MARGA] Are you the owner
of this gallery, huh?

540
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,687
[BETTY] Yes.

541
00:28:08,812 --> 00:28:12,148
Do you know what kind
of artist Leona is?

542
00:28:16,403 --> 00:28:17,404
[HECTOR SOFTLY] Marga.

543
00:28:17,570 --> 00:28:20,115
[MARGA] "Strength of a woman."

544
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:21,907
You hypocrite!

545
00:28:21,908 --> 00:28:22,701
[HECTOR SOFTLY] Marga, please.

546
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,786
You know you're a mistress!

547
00:28:25,078 --> 00:28:26,162
One night stand.

548
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,622
A harlot!

549
00:28:28,748 --> 00:28:31,418
You know what your strength is?

550
00:28:32,335 --> 00:28:35,171
To steal somebody's husband!

551
00:28:42,053 --> 00:28:43,638
What the hell are you wearing?

552
00:28:44,180 --> 00:28:45,598
Are we in P.E. class?

553
00:28:45,974 --> 00:28:46,766
Yana?

554
00:28:47,142 --> 00:28:48,810
[AMELIE] And what is that paper bag?

555
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:50,686
Is it Christmas season?

556
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:52,522
Is it for an exchange gift?

557
00:28:53,273 --> 00:28:56,151
That's what I wanted to
tell you a while ago, okay?

558
00:28:56,234 --> 00:28:57,026
What?

559
00:28:58,278 --> 00:28:59,237
Basically,

560
00:28:59,654 --> 00:29:00,738
[STUTTERS] This is Gabo's.

561
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:01,531
What?!

562
00:29:01,823 --> 00:29:02,615
Gabo?

563
00:29:04,617 --> 00:29:05,577
Hurry up!

564
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:06,369
What do you mean Gabo?

565
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:09,581
We need to leave now.
That new investigator is here!

566
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:13,542
She might interrogate us!

567
00:29:13,543 --> 00:29:14,710
Wait, you met her?

568
00:29:14,711 --> 00:29:16,378
No, I just saw her talking to Liv.

569
00:29:16,379 --> 00:29:17,172
Huh?

570
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,215
She really does look scary.

571
00:29:20,049 --> 00:29:20,967
Promise!

572
00:29:22,051 --> 00:29:23,845
Are you talking about me?

573
00:29:24,053 --> 00:29:24,846
[SNIFFLES]

574
00:29:25,513 --> 00:29:28,975
I am Inspector Georgia Dimaunahan.

575
00:29:29,309 --> 00:29:31,144
And you three...

576
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,813
I know you three very well!

577
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:39,527
Because you three are the
ones that killed Zach Zamora!

578
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:43,656
[YANA] Excuse me,
how dare you accuse us?

579
00:29:43,990 --> 00:29:46,700
Did you know that we could
sue you for slander?

580
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:47,911
Slander?

581
00:29:48,077 --> 00:29:49,162
[CHUCKLES] Oh.

582
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:52,207
Not if I have proof!

583
00:29:54,209 --> 00:29:56,252
[SUGAR SOBS] Yes, I admit it.

584
00:29:56,586 --> 00:29:59,297
I tampered with Coach Zach's lighter.

585
00:29:59,380 --> 00:29:59,964
[YANA ON TAPE] My...

586
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:00,965
[GULPS]

587
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:04,510
Mommy's family owns a firework company.

588
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:06,554
[SNIFFLES]

589
00:30:07,722 --> 00:30:09,766
That's where I got the fireworks powder from.

590
00:30:10,350 --> 00:30:14,436
[AMELIE ON TAPE] I replaced Zach's body oil
with pure tea tree oil.

591
00:30:14,437 --> 00:30:15,522
[YANA SOBBING]

592
00:30:17,482 --> 00:30:18,525
Gotcha!

593
00:30:21,069 --> 00:30:24,781
[LIV VOICEOVER] My friends and I,
we're all good at keeping secrets.

594
00:30:25,240 --> 00:30:29,452
So, will they ever find out who
betrayed them this time?

595
00:30:34,040 --> 00:30:35,333
Well, who isn't here?

596
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:37,293
Who called us here?

597
00:30:38,044 --> 00:30:39,920
And who's not affected
with the recording?

598
00:30:39,921 --> 00:30:40,922
Liv...?

599
00:30:41,422 --> 00:30:43,799
Guys, let us talk about this properly.

600
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:44,926
What are you guys doing here?

601
00:30:44,968 --> 00:30:46,219
I have to give you something.

602
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,262
[YANA SHRIEKS]

603
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:49,012
The kids are in big trouble.

604
00:30:49,013 --> 00:30:51,099
There is a new investigator in Zach’s case.

605
00:30:51,307 --> 00:30:54,769
And she is very determined to
pin the murder on us.

606
00:30:54,978 --> 00:30:58,356
She has a recording of us talking
about how Zach died.

607
00:30:58,523 --> 00:31:00,859
We can use this as leverage

608
00:31:00,900 --> 00:31:02,693
so one of them betrays the others.

609
00:31:02,694 --> 00:31:04,904
We just need to find out who

610
00:31:04,946 --> 00:31:07,907
the weakest is among the group.

611
00:31:07,991 --> 00:31:10,535
I can reduce the punishment
for your crimes.

612
00:31:11,452 --> 00:31:12,996
But if you do not help me out,

613
00:31:13,538 --> 00:31:14,581
you will rot in jail.
