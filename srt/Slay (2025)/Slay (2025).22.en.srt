Just so I could provide for you!

539
00:23:11,723 --> 00:23:13,558
But now I'm having a hard time.

540
00:23:14,976 --> 00:23:16,061
Maybe you're right.

541
00:23:16,645 --> 00:23:17,646
I have a gambling addiction.

542
00:23:21,024 --> 00:23:23,652
And I don't know how to get out of this. [POLICE SIREN]

543
00:23:26,029 --> 00:23:26,822
So I'm...

544
00:23:27,239 --> 00:23:28,281
I'm sorry.

545
00:23:28,615 --> 00:23:29,366
Okay?

546
00:23:30,033 --> 00:23:30,826
Yana.

547
00:23:31,701 --> 00:23:32,786
I'm sorry.

548
00:23:34,371 --> 00:23:35,372
[POLICE] Good day.

549
00:23:36,581 --> 00:23:38,250
[POLICE]  Are you Charlie Chua?

550
00:23:40,627 --> 00:23:41,837
Uh... I am.

551
00:23:42,087 --> 00:23:45,006
There's a complaint against you from Nolan Tapanes.

552
00:23:45,340 --> 00:23:47,884
You have many debts that you haven't paid.

553
00:23:48,510 --> 00:23:50,219
You thought you could hide from me?

554
00:23:50,220 --> 00:23:52,347
I filed a complaint in the district but you ignored it.

555
00:23:53,056 --> 00:23:55,058
You really have no intention to pay me back.

556
00:23:55,308 --> 00:23:57,686
That's why my lawyer escalated it to the fiscal, Charlie.

557
00:23:57,853 --> 00:23:59,229
We're suing you for estafa.

558
00:24:01,648 --> 00:24:02,274
Estafa?

559
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:05,694
Yes, your daddy owes me a lot.

560
00:24:06,236 --> 00:24:07,487
He doesn't want to pay up?

561
00:24:07,654 --> 00:24:08,321
So there...

562
00:24:08,405 --> 00:24:09,281
Nolan.

563
00:24:09,906 --> 00:24:10,699

Let's talk about this.

565

We've brought your warrant of arrest that came from the judge.

566

Come with us quietly.

[POLICE] Come with us to the precinct. [YANA] Please don't hurt my daddy!

00:24:40,353 --> 00:24:41,021
Sorry!

584
00:24:41,062 --> 00:24:41,480

587
00:24:45,734 --> 00:24:47,277
I'm sorry, Yana! [COPS] You dare escape, huh!?

588
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,528
- Yana, I'm sorry! - Daddy I'll follow you.

Hey isn't that "Lawgirl"?

00:24:50,197 --> 00:24:52,156
That's "lawgirl" Yana Chua!

591
00:24:52,157 --> 00:24:53,741
That's her daddy, right? Why's he being arrested?

592
00:24:53,742 --> 00:24:54,868
I don't know!

593
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:08,882
Can you stop that please?

594
00:25:09,007 --> 00:25:10,759
Can you please leave my dad and I alone, okay?

595
00:25:10,800 --> 00:25:11,593
Can you just stop?

596
00:25:12,260 --> 00:25:13,678
Can you just stop taking a video?

597
00:25:13,720 --> 00:25:14,137
Gabo!

Can you just stop?

Huh? [EXHALES]

616
00:25:35,784 --> 00:25:37,619
We came from the Baltazars' house.

617
00:25:38,036 --> 00:25:39,162
But you don't live there anymore.

618
00:25:39,996 --> 00:25:42,165
We spoke to your cousin, Debbie Tapanes.

619
00:25:42,332 --> 00:25:46,253
And she told us that this is where we could find your dad, Charlie Chua.

620
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:48,964
We were going to ask him where we could find you but,

621
00:25:49,047 --> 00:25:50,881
who would've thought that you were here too.

00:25:59,266 --> 00:26:00,976
to believe that you had motive

626
00:26:01,101 --> 00:26:03,436

She's being interrogated by the investigators now.

633

Why didn't she say anything?

634
00:26:24,958 --> 00:26:26,459
She said she was trying to call you guys,

635
00:26:26,626 --> 00:26:28,169
but apparently you guys were ignoring her.

You planned to burn Zach!
