or you'll surrender!

533
00:21:42,217 --> 00:21:43,051
What is it?

534
00:21:43,176 --> 00:21:44,886
You're so stubborn, get out of the way!

535
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:46,013
- [AMELIE] Just stop, Mom!

536
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:47,556
- [AMELIE] Stop!
- You don't want to get out of the way, huh?

537
00:21:47,556 --> 00:21:50,475
[SUGAR VOICEOVER] If I were in
Amelie's position,

538
00:21:50,475 --> 00:21:52,019
- [SUGAR VOICEOVER] I'd do the same thing.
- Mom!

539
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:53,312
- [AMELIE] Mom!
- [SUGAR VOICEOVER] I'd defend my mom

540
00:21:53,395 --> 00:21:55,188
- [AMELIE] Mom!
- [SUGAR VOICEOVER] and let her escape.

541
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,941
[TIRES SQUEALING]

542
00:21:57,941 --> 00:21:59,609
[SUGAR VOICEOVER] But Marga isn't my mother.

543
00:22:00,444 --> 00:22:01,236
[AMELIE STUTTERS] Mom!

544
00:22:01,403 --> 00:22:02,279
- Mom!
- [SUGAR VOICEOVER] Unfortunately for her.

545
00:22:02,696 --> 00:22:05,198
[SUGAR VOICEOVER] I will personally
send her to jail.

546
00:22:06,074 --> 00:22:07,451
[KIRBY] What's his case?

547
00:22:07,534 --> 00:22:08,410
[POLICEMAN] Pedophilia.

548
00:22:08,410 --> 00:22:09,244
You know him?

549
00:22:09,411 --> 00:22:10,954
He's a close friend of Leonard.

550
00:22:11,121 --> 00:22:13,206
Please contact Inspector Juro.

551
00:22:13,206 --> 00:22:15,083
[ROLDAN] Our daughter's in trouble.

552
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,669
Marga is a wanted person because

553
00:22:18,045 --> 00:22:20,130
she is Byron's real killer.

554
00:22:20,213 --> 00:22:21,798
My brother died, Amelie!

555
00:22:21,798 --> 00:22:23,425
- He got murdered!
- So what do you want?

556
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,052
Do you want to kill her too?

557
00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,054
She took a life, Amelie.

558
00:22:27,471 --> 00:22:29,181
So she should pay it with her life.

559
00:22:29,222 --> 00:22:30,432
[KIRBY] He was arrested.

560
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:31,975
[KIRBY] Alleged pedophile.

561
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,686
Here are the pictures
of all of their victims.

562
00:22:34,978 --> 00:22:35,896
I recognize him.

563
00:22:35,937 --> 00:22:37,022
Who is he?

564
00:22:37,314 --> 00:22:38,357
That's Zach.

565
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,234
Zach Zamora.
