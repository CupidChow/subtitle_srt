I want you to be a lawyer even
if I am no longer here.

00:22:25,135 --> 00:22:27,011
Dad, why are you saying goodbye?

556
00:22:27,012 --> 00:22:28,679
Don't talk like that, okay?

557
00:22:28,680 --> 00:22:30,431
You are going to live!

558
00:22:30,432 --> 00:22:32,683
You're going to live!

559
00:22:32,684 --> 00:22:35,311
I am sorry, please forgive me.

560
00:22:35,312 --> 00:22:39,399
If I wasn't a good father to you.

561
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:45,489
At least I'm not as bad as Leonard.

562
00:22:46,239 --> 00:22:47,281
Ahhhh!

- [GABO ] Uncle?
- [LIV] Uncle?

564
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,243
Don't leave me! Don't talk like that.

565
00:22:51,244 --> 00:22:52,829
I still need you, okay?

566
00:22:53,163 --> 00:22:54,830
I still need you, okay?

00:22:55,792 --> 00:22:57,626
I love you so much.

When does fatherhood end?

574
00:23:16,895 --> 00:23:17,813
Never.

575
00:23:18,522 --> 00:23:20,357
Until my blood runs dry.

576
00:23:20,857 --> 00:23:27,364
Until my dying breath,
I will always be my father's daughter.

577
00:23:28,323 --> 00:23:30,825
It is called dissociative amnesia.

578
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,701
Certain types of drugs or alcohol

579
00:23:32,702 --> 00:23:36,080
can make people forget their bad memories.

580
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:41,336
There is a way to recover
these buried memories through therapy.

581
00:23:41,711 --> 00:23:44,673
So, Zach was drinking that?

582
00:23:47,175 --> 00:23:49,970
Yes, he got water from the dispenser.

583
00:23:51,763 --> 00:23:55,225
Did you notice anything unusual in his water?

584
00:23:55,517 --> 00:23:58,019
Inspector, I am glad you're okay.

585
00:23:58,395 --> 00:24:01,398
I saw you in Zach's office

586
00:24:02,482 --> 00:24:04,484
on the day that he died.
