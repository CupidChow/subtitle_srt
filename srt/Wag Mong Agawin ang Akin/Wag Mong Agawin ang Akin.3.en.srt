1
00:00:00,291 --> 00:00:03,002
Benito, you’re hurting me.

2
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:04,686
Christine?

3
00:00:06,123 --> 00:00:07,143
Christine!

4
00:00:07,168 --> 00:00:08,218
All mine.

5
00:00:08,512 --> 00:00:11,182
You don’t have any other family.

6
00:00:11,720 --> 00:00:13,388
You’re mine!

7
00:00:14,708 --> 00:00:16,710
- I can’t take it anymore, Marie.
- Hey, Jasmine.

8
00:00:17,559 --> 00:00:20,186
I feel so dirty.

9
00:00:20,311 --> 00:00:23,606
Hello, Sephy. Do you
remember that girl who went viral?

10
00:00:23,606 --> 00:00:24,899
Yes, of course!

11
00:00:25,066 --> 00:00:28,153
Shit. Prima sent me an email.

12
00:00:28,178 --> 00:00:29,070
Prima?

13
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:30,947
- Yes, they saw my video that went viral.

14
00:00:30,947 --> 00:00:32,115
The company of your idol?

15
00:00:32,115 --> 00:00:33,491
Did you just say Prima?

16
00:00:33,765 --> 00:00:34,932
We’re from Prima.

17
00:00:36,502 --> 00:00:38,630
If you love your girlfriend–

18
00:00:38,655 --> 00:00:40,365
Then why are you here with me?

19
00:00:49,742 --> 00:00:51,493
I love you, Christine.

20
00:02:13,992 --> 00:02:17,704
Do you really need to look at your
ex’s photo while we’re having sex?

21
00:02:17,729 --> 00:02:19,648
Yeah, is that a problem?

22
00:02:19,673 --> 00:02:21,383
If you don’t like it, you can leave.

23
00:02:24,442 --> 00:02:25,797
Come here.

24
00:03:11,514 --> 00:03:12,723
Tin.

25
00:03:13,902 --> 00:03:16,209
You’re looking at your
daughter's picture again.

26
00:03:17,071 --> 00:03:19,553
Why do you keep on entertaining pain?

27
00:03:21,951 --> 00:03:23,928
I’m not trying to hurt myself.

28
00:03:25,914 --> 00:03:28,865
I need to have faith, to keep me alive.

29
00:03:29,930 --> 00:03:31,483
I understand that.

30
00:03:33,125 --> 00:03:34,961
But give yourself a break.

31
00:03:35,861 --> 00:03:38,155
You’re just making
things worse for yourself.

32
00:03:39,536 --> 00:03:42,122
I know when to snap out of this.

33
00:03:44,033 --> 00:03:45,201
You know what?

34
00:03:45,677 --> 00:03:47,554
Prima has a new model.

35
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:50,514
She’d be the same age as Lara if–

36
00:03:53,389 --> 00:03:56,326
I believe we’ll meet again.

37
00:03:59,365 --> 00:04:01,897
We’re not even sure if she's still alive.

38
00:04:04,327 --> 00:04:08,272
All those private investigators you
keep hiring always hit dead ends.

39
00:04:09,794 --> 00:04:11,772
They suddenly just stop giving updates.

40
00:04:13,093 --> 00:04:14,135
Come on.

41
00:04:16,714 --> 00:04:18,279
I have a feeling–

42
00:04:19,926 --> 00:04:21,261
Oh, Tin.

43
00:04:22,585 --> 00:04:25,462
How could I let go of being a mother if

44
00:04:25,848 --> 00:04:28,268
I could still feel that she’s alive?

45
00:04:32,981 --> 00:04:36,484
Tin, I’m here for you.

46
00:04:37,484 --> 00:04:39,903
We got this, together.

47
00:04:41,244 --> 00:04:42,263
Right?

48
00:05:21,925 --> 00:05:23,593
Are you dating someone?

49
00:05:24,115 --> 00:05:26,613
Oh Tin, I know that look.

50
00:05:27,691 --> 00:05:28,776
Lovers’ quarrel?

51
00:05:30,986 --> 00:05:34,073
I’m not dating anyone, I’m just tired.

52
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:38,129
We launched a new male
model under Prima today.

53
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:39,612
He was so friendly.

54
00:05:40,308 --> 00:05:42,113
It drained all my energy.

55
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,862
That’s what makes them good.

56
00:05:45,237 --> 00:05:46,326
You know?

57
00:05:46,877 --> 00:05:48,212
Good company.

58
00:05:58,451 --> 00:05:59,994
Is that Ryan again?

59
00:06:01,397 --> 00:06:03,065
Is he still bothering you?

60
00:06:05,228 --> 00:06:08,189
He really takes after his asshole dad.

61
00:06:09,237 --> 00:06:10,864
Charming on the outside but

62
00:06:11,258 --> 00:06:13,301
so rotten on the inside.

63
00:06:14,717 --> 00:06:20,598
It’s a good thing Benito
bequeathed Prima to you.

64
00:06:21,375 --> 00:06:25,496
In all fairness, you worked really hard.

65
00:06:27,618 --> 00:06:30,371
He can give Ryan everything else,

66
00:06:31,186 --> 00:06:32,793
just leave Prima to me.

67
00:06:33,773 --> 00:06:37,110
In exchange for all the
abuse he put me through.

68
00:06:38,301 --> 00:06:39,719
At least this time,

69
00:06:40,413 --> 00:06:42,665
I’m the master of my own body.

70
00:06:43,196 --> 00:06:44,530
My own life.

71
00:06:46,217 --> 00:06:47,719
Very well said, Tin.

72
00:06:48,070 --> 00:06:51,285
Besides, there are so many men around.

73
00:06:51,879 --> 00:06:52,954
On the brightside,

74
00:06:52,954 --> 00:06:55,331
you can choose whoever
you want at any time.

75
00:06:55,855 --> 00:06:58,149
Especially if you can afford them.

76
00:07:01,087 --> 00:07:03,801
Speaking of, how is your boy toy?

77
00:07:05,562 --> 00:07:06,897
I don’t know,

78
00:07:07,656 --> 00:07:09,866
he just ghosted me.

79
00:07:11,085 --> 00:07:14,660
He even stopped posting on social media.

80
00:07:16,505 --> 00:07:18,293
Maybe he found someone already.

81
00:07:19,781 --> 00:07:23,051
Maybe something happened to him,
aren’t you gonna try and check in on  him?

82
00:07:24,277 --> 00:07:30,199
Dear, this is not the first
time a guy ghosted me.

83
00:07:30,505 --> 00:07:31,589
It is what it is.

84
00:07:32,777 --> 00:07:36,441
Besides, there’s always someone new.

85
00:07:36,929 --> 00:07:38,681
Someone younger.

86
00:07:39,696 --> 00:07:41,155
More attractive.

87
00:07:46,340 --> 00:07:48,968
The number you have reached is not in ser–

88
00:07:49,523 --> 00:07:51,525
Oh my god, girl.

89
00:07:52,714 --> 00:07:54,799
Here I am talking to you.

90
00:07:54,861 --> 00:07:56,696
While you're busy with your phone.

91
00:07:57,385 --> 00:07:58,887
Who is this lucky guy?

92
00:07:59,606 --> 00:08:01,524
Nothing, I was just checking on something.

93
00:08:03,746 --> 00:08:05,206
Whatever.

94
00:08:05,643 --> 00:08:07,353
Fine, let's just drink.

95
00:08:07,715 --> 00:08:08,800
Cheers.

96
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,282
Cheers.

97
00:08:43,817 --> 00:08:45,577
My man.

98
00:08:46,347 --> 00:08:47,932
That’s what I'm talking about.

99
00:08:48,551 --> 00:08:50,761
By the way, we need to check out later.

100
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,919
Where’s Jasmine?

101
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:58,897
What happened?

102
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:07,317
Have you fallen?

103
00:09:11,344 --> 00:09:12,929
Damn girl.

104
00:09:14,303 --> 00:09:15,596
That’s a first.

105
00:09:15,895 --> 00:09:18,064
I didn’t fall for him.

106
00:09:19,178 --> 00:09:21,972
But there’s something about him.

107
00:09:22,128 --> 00:09:24,319
It’s like there’s a connection between us.

108
00:09:25,815 --> 00:09:27,525
Oh no girl–

109
00:09:28,494 --> 00:09:30,621
You really fell for him.

110
00:09:31,856 --> 00:09:33,149
First of all,

111
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,491
you didn’t let him pay.

112
00:09:36,146 --> 00:09:37,153
Second,

113
00:09:38,081 --> 00:09:39,541
you let him kiss you on the lips?

114
00:09:40,016 --> 00:09:41,601
And you liked it.

115
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:43,121
Third,

116
00:09:43,171 --> 00:09:45,423
he made you feel “something.”

117
00:09:46,642 --> 00:09:49,395
I wasn’t planning on making him pay.

118
00:09:50,084 --> 00:09:52,878
And you know I want to start over.

119
00:09:53,094 --> 00:09:54,470
It’s my way of thanking him.

120
00:09:54,642 --> 00:09:56,185
Thank you?

121
00:09:57,100 --> 00:09:58,154
Oh, please.

122
00:09:58,337 --> 00:10:01,171
If I were you, I’d give
in to your feelings.

123
00:10:01,579 --> 00:10:03,081
These things don’t happen often.

124
00:10:03,574 --> 00:10:07,370
And he’s not even sure
if they’re still together.

125
00:10:07,709 --> 00:10:08,710
So go for it.

126
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:12,531
As if you’d go for something like this.

127
00:10:13,075 --> 00:10:15,694
I’ll think about it like
ten thousand times.

128
00:10:21,294 --> 00:10:24,038
What if the guy’s another asshole?

129
00:10:28,226 --> 00:10:30,788
What if I have children
and still be like this?

130
00:10:37,678 --> 00:10:41,057
I don’t want my child to end up like me.

131
00:10:41,169 --> 00:10:42,545
Having a slut for a mom.

132
00:10:44,388 --> 00:10:45,931
That’s why I got an abortion.

133
00:10:48,058 --> 00:10:49,310
Marie.

134
00:10:56,592 --> 00:10:58,594
There’s still a chance for you to meet Tom.

135
00:10:58,924 --> 00:11:00,885
Who knows you might end up together.

136
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:01,937
What?

137
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:03,275
What do you mean, what?

138
00:11:03,402 --> 00:11:05,237
Aren’t you modeling for Prima?

139
00:11:05,534 --> 00:11:06,619
Prima?

140
00:11:07,273 --> 00:11:09,942
Oh right, is this really
happening? Am I dreaming?

141
00:11:10,129 --> 00:11:13,591
Want me to slap you, so you’ll wake up from
that dream of yours?

142
00:11:15,833 --> 00:11:18,093
You’re modeling for Prima.

143
00:11:18,745 --> 00:11:20,413
- Let’s just eat.
- I’m hungry.

144
00:11:20,438 --> 00:11:21,461
Dig in.

145
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:25,457
Sir, have you seen the
guest from the pavilion?

146
00:11:25,482 --> 00:11:27,640
They already checked out an hour ago.

147
00:13:35,095 --> 00:13:36,148
Anton?

148
00:13:38,267 --> 00:13:39,318
Sorry.

149
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:44,268
Sorry I forgot to lock the door.

150
00:13:54,359 --> 00:13:55,944
I miss you, love.

151
00:13:56,272 --> 00:13:57,982
When are you coming back?

152
00:13:58,808 --> 00:14:02,312
I’ve been calling you but
your phone’s out of service.

153
00:14:11,574 --> 00:14:12,783
Hello, Tom?

154
00:14:14,542 --> 00:14:15,601
I’m sorry.

155
00:14:15,626 --> 00:14:17,002
I’m sorry.

156
00:14:18,393 --> 00:14:21,020
I’m sorry, my phone was off, I was just–

157
00:14:21,300 --> 00:14:22,509
No Tom, no need to explain.

158
00:14:23,685 --> 00:14:25,020
I understand.

159
00:14:25,948 --> 00:14:27,741
I’m the one who should apologize.

160
00:14:27,766 --> 00:14:29,184
I was a bit harsh.

161
00:14:29,577 --> 00:14:30,661
No, I get it.

162
00:14:31,210 --> 00:14:32,670
I’m glad you messaged me.

163
00:14:33,158 --> 00:14:34,201
I miss you,

164
00:14:34,712 --> 00:14:35,796
it’s been a week.

165
00:14:35,986 --> 00:14:37,196
I’ve missed you too.

166
00:14:37,459 --> 00:14:38,502
Are we still together?

167
00:14:39,428 --> 00:14:41,555
Yes, we’re still together Tom.

168
00:14:41,953 --> 00:14:43,788
I love you, you know that.

169
00:14:45,217 --> 00:14:49,054
But, I still haven’t decided.

170
00:14:49,661 --> 00:14:51,663
I need to think about it more.

171
00:14:54,745 --> 00:14:56,038
I respect that.

172
00:14:57,875 --> 00:14:58,915
Thank you.

173
00:15:01,358 --> 00:15:04,904
We’re heading back to
Manila. I’ll meet you after?

174
00:15:06,855 --> 00:15:08,356
Okay, I'll wait for you.

175
00:15:08,745 --> 00:15:10,914
I’ll call you when I’m on my way.

176
00:15:12,567 --> 00:15:14,778
Okay, I love you.

177
00:15:14,913 --> 00:15:15,947
Love you.

178
00:15:33,721 --> 00:15:36,391
Next time, tell me when you're coming home.

179
00:15:36,669 --> 00:15:39,797
So I could cook your favorite food.

180
00:15:39,907 --> 00:15:42,410
Mom, you know anything
you cook is my favorite.

181
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:46,403
Mom, are you just cooking all day?

182
00:15:46,442 --> 00:15:48,403
Do you even eat? You’re losing weight.

183
00:15:48,864 --> 00:15:53,494
Oh please, I’m getting
sick of eating the food here.

184
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:54,540
Just eat.

185
00:15:54,807 --> 00:15:56,684
Mom, take care of yourself.

186
00:15:58,086 --> 00:16:01,256
As you can see, your mom is still sexy.

187
00:16:01,486 --> 00:16:02,570
Just eat.

188
00:16:04,158 --> 00:16:05,701
Mom, before I forget.

189
00:16:06,006 --> 00:16:07,916
You know I don’t want
to stay long because of–

190
00:16:09,712 --> 00:16:10,713
Thank you.

191
00:16:11,589 --> 00:16:12,766
Wait, I don’t–

192
00:16:12,791 --> 00:16:13,901
Hey bro!

193
00:16:13,926 --> 00:16:14,938
We won.

194
00:16:18,724 --> 00:16:19,766
- Mom.
- We won.

195
00:16:20,626 --> 00:16:21,644
I’ll go ahead.

196
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,065
Yeah, sure.

197
00:16:24,899 --> 00:16:25,940
Wait.

198
00:16:28,330 --> 00:16:29,581
I know you're mad at me.

199
00:16:31,333 --> 00:16:33,877
But don’t disrespect your mother.

200
00:16:35,097 --> 00:16:36,223
When did I do that?

201
00:16:38,682 --> 00:16:40,196
You’re being rude.

202
00:16:40,668 --> 00:16:42,419
It's like we're not your parents.

203
00:16:42,949 --> 00:16:45,910
I know you’re the one providing for us.

204
00:16:46,643 --> 00:16:49,187
But, you shouldn’t treat us like this.

205
00:16:51,313 --> 00:16:52,320
Tom, please stop.

206
00:16:53,986 --> 00:16:55,487
I respect her.

207
00:16:55,943 --> 00:16:57,153
Do you?

208
00:16:57,178 --> 00:16:58,192
Of course.

209
00:16:59,226 --> 00:17:00,561
I love your mom.

210
00:17:00,640 --> 00:17:01,845
That’s why I came back.

211
00:17:01,979 --> 00:17:04,356
You left us for some old rich woman.

212
00:17:04,381 --> 00:17:05,715
Don’t use that against me.

213
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,742
You don’t know the whole story.

214
00:17:08,235 --> 00:17:09,278
Edgar, stop.

215
00:17:09,278 --> 00:17:10,738
As far as I know–

216
00:17:10,738 --> 00:17:15,501
You got sick and came back, ‘cause
she didn’t want to take care of you.

217
00:17:15,526 --> 00:17:16,573
That’s why you’re here.

218
00:17:16,598 --> 00:17:17,766
Edgar, stop.

219
00:17:20,695 --> 00:17:23,323
Christine is older than you, right?

220
00:17:23,818 --> 00:17:25,069
She’s also rich?

221
00:17:26,354 --> 00:17:28,106
So what’s the difference between us?

222
00:17:30,572 --> 00:17:32,407
I didn’t leave a family behind.

223
00:17:34,610 --> 00:17:36,111
Son.

224
00:17:37,267 --> 00:17:38,290
Tom!

225
00:17:44,891 --> 00:17:45,923
Tom!

226
00:17:53,087 --> 00:17:54,338
I’m really sorry.

227
00:17:55,329 --> 00:17:56,377
It’s okay.

228
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:57,849
I missed this.

229
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,888
Are you hungry? Do you
want me to cook for you?

230
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,080
There’s no need.

231
00:18:04,789 --> 00:18:07,333
I know that you’re still
hurt about what happened.

232
00:18:08,469 --> 00:18:10,262
And I understand.

233
00:18:11,098 --> 00:18:12,766
And I’m glad you’re here.

234
00:18:14,345 --> 00:18:15,555
I love you.

235
00:18:15,580 --> 00:18:16,957
I love you, too.

236
00:18:45,254 --> 00:18:46,422
Hello.

237
00:18:46,875 --> 00:18:49,253
- Yes?
- Where is the HR’s office?

238
00:18:49,253 --> 00:18:50,462
It’s on the eight floor.

239
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:52,548
Oh, eight floor, thank you.

240
00:19:07,046 --> 00:19:09,007
Prima Beauty.

241
00:19:13,271 --> 00:19:14,439
This is it, Jasmine.

242
00:19:14,913 --> 00:19:17,382
This is your chance to start anew.

243
00:19:17,999 --> 00:19:20,419
Just like what Miss
Christine said, grab it.

244
00:19:22,009 --> 00:19:25,012
This is your chance to start over.

245
00:19:46,942 --> 00:19:48,778
Miss Jasmine Reyes?

246
00:19:48,803 --> 00:19:50,367
They’re waiting for you.

247
00:19:50,846 --> 00:19:52,399
This way, please.

248
00:19:57,588 --> 00:20:00,549
A warm welcome to Prima
Beauty, Miss Jasmine.

249
00:20:00,574 --> 00:20:02,461
-Thank you, ma’am.
-Thank you for your time.

250
00:20:04,162 --> 00:20:08,041
She has shown that no
matter the obstacles in life,

251
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:11,242
nothing stands in the way of your dreams.

252
00:20:12,589 --> 00:20:14,340
No matter what you’ve been through

253
00:20:14,755 --> 00:20:20,336
if you use your talents,
patience, wits and beauty

254
00:20:20,763 --> 00:20:23,125
dreams will not just be dreams.

255
00:20:23,845 --> 00:20:27,807
We watched streetlamp
girl Miss Jasmine Reyes.

256
00:20:27,966 --> 00:20:30,219
The new face of Prima Beauty.

257
00:20:35,783 --> 00:20:37,164
It’s your fuck buddy.

258
00:20:37,701 --> 00:20:39,829
Be quiet, she’s not my fuck buddy.

259
00:20:40,248 --> 00:20:42,459
Hmm, casual friend?

260
00:20:43,119 --> 00:20:44,329
FWB?

261
00:20:44,969 --> 00:20:46,262
Friends with benefits.

262
00:20:46,287 --> 00:20:47,330
Okay.

263
00:20:47,474 --> 00:20:49,518
Let's draft the contract for Miss Jasmine.

264
00:20:49,989 --> 00:20:51,616
It looks like the board approves.

265
00:20:52,414 --> 00:20:53,456
So,

266
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:57,012
are we really gonna make this decision now?

267
00:20:58,405 --> 00:21:00,365
Who here disagrees?

268
00:21:03,240 --> 00:21:05,993
Great! So we’ve come to a decision.

269
00:21:06,742 --> 00:21:08,771
I hope you accept our offer,

270
00:21:09,004 --> 00:21:10,005
Miss Jasmine.

271
00:21:10,603 --> 00:21:12,140
Is it okay with you?

272
00:21:13,519 --> 00:21:14,979
Are you okay?

273
00:21:15,004 --> 00:21:16,080
No.

274
00:21:16,588 --> 00:21:18,906
No, I meant-

275
00:21:19,663 --> 00:21:23,041
Yes, it would be an honor to
be the face of Prima Beauty.

276
00:21:23,746 --> 00:21:26,081
I was just surprised
there wasn’t an interview.

277
00:21:27,165 --> 00:21:30,710
Never forget that mama is so proud of you.

278
00:21:32,400 --> 00:21:35,611
But I really want to be a part of this.

279
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:39,875
Sorry, I was just starstruck.

280
00:21:43,414 --> 00:21:44,557
Of course,

281
00:21:44,886 --> 00:21:47,013
you’ll be a part of this.

282
00:21:47,701 --> 00:21:50,120
This is your interview with everyone.

283
00:21:51,085 --> 00:21:52,112
And also-

284
00:21:52,857 --> 00:21:54,651
You can let go of my hand.

285
00:21:55,312 --> 00:21:56,410
I’m sorry.

286
00:22:01,188 --> 00:22:03,774
Now be with my staff,
they’ll take care of you.

287
00:22:04,243 --> 00:22:05,954
They’ll explain everything to you.

288
00:22:06,298 --> 00:22:09,217
- Sorry, I have to go. I have a meeting.
- Okay.

289
00:22:14,791 --> 00:22:15,959
Did I say something wrong?

290
00:22:15,984 --> 00:22:16,852
No, nothing.

291
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:18,328
Well, maybe it’s just her migraine.

292
00:22:18,430 --> 00:22:20,349
I’ll leave you here, okay? Excuse me.

293
00:23:34,725 --> 00:23:38,353
Sis, why did you leave? You don’t have
a meeting scheduled after.

294
00:23:38,455 --> 00:23:40,123
I thought you were gonna interview her?

295
00:23:40,863 --> 00:23:42,073
I can’t help it.

296
00:23:43,525 --> 00:23:45,527
She reminds me of Lara.

297
00:23:46,904 --> 00:23:49,031
If she’s still alive, she
would’ve been that age.

298
00:23:50,404 --> 00:23:53,950
And I don’t want the
board to think I'm emotional.

299
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:56,976
They might think I’m a weak leader.

300
00:23:57,920 --> 00:23:59,002
Sis,

301
00:23:59,818 --> 00:24:01,528
don’t think that way.

302
00:24:02,075 --> 00:24:08,039
And it’s only natural you’d feel the
way you do, when you met Jasmine.

303
00:24:08,889 --> 00:24:09,917
Okay?

304
00:24:10,048 --> 00:24:11,074
Calm down.

305
00:24:14,240 --> 00:24:16,785
Benito, please I’m begging you.

306
00:24:18,796 --> 00:24:21,590
Aunt Fely got into an accident.

307
00:24:22,565 --> 00:24:25,151
I need to find my daughter Benito.

308
00:24:25,627 --> 00:24:27,404
Please, I'm begging you.

309
00:24:29,082 --> 00:24:31,646
Please, I'm begging you, Benito.

310
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:37,154
Please, I'm begging you, my daughter–

311
00:24:41,475 --> 00:24:46,288
You should’ve thought of that first

312
00:24:46,883 --> 00:24:48,009
what you were going to do

313
00:24:48,596 --> 00:24:50,389
before you disobeyed me.

314
00:24:52,709 --> 00:24:53,877
Benito.

315
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:58,045
My daughter, Benito.

316
00:24:58,708 --> 00:25:02,128
I thought the pain would lessen, over time.

317
00:25:04,304 --> 00:25:05,471
But I was wrong.

318
00:25:07,656 --> 00:25:10,076
It hurts more, as time goes on.

319
00:25:12,795 --> 00:25:16,381
It hurts even more that I haven’t
seen my daughter for so long.

320
00:25:17,732 --> 00:25:21,903
Any updates from your private investigator?

321
00:25:23,005 --> 00:25:24,632
Did he find anything?

322
00:25:27,337 --> 00:25:28,380
Almost.

323
00:25:28,910 --> 00:25:31,162
He has talked to a lot of people.

324
00:25:31,939 --> 00:25:35,400
I’m actually meeting him next
week, so he could update me.

325
00:25:36,381 --> 00:25:42,345
I hope he doesn’t back out or disappear,
like the previous ones.

326
00:25:45,310 --> 00:25:46,398
You know what,

327
00:25:47,918 --> 00:25:49,670
just stay here and rest.

328
00:25:49,695 --> 00:25:52,156
I’ll handle Jasmine. Okay?

329
00:25:52,329 --> 00:25:54,164
Everything will be alright.

330
00:25:56,330 --> 00:25:57,498
Thank you, Sephy.

331
00:25:57,855 --> 00:25:59,648
And I’ll go to Vince’s place later.

332
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:02,002
He said he’ll cook dinner, join us.

333
00:26:03,967 --> 00:26:05,003
Okay,

334
00:26:05,420 --> 00:26:07,297
Tom will be coming home late anyways.

335
00:26:07,691 --> 00:26:09,276
Hmm, perfect!

336
00:26:09,276 --> 00:26:11,444
Alright, just stay here and rest.

337
00:26:26,722 --> 00:26:27,723
Hello, babe.

338
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:31,193
Yes, can you cook for three later?

339
00:26:31,528 --> 00:26:33,475
I invited Christine.

340
00:26:34,579 --> 00:26:37,256
Yay! Thanks, babe. Love you.

341
00:26:39,557 --> 00:26:42,477
Hey, congrats. I told
you, you would get in.

342
00:26:42,517 --> 00:26:44,853
- You didn’t even need our help.
- Thank you.

343
00:26:45,359 --> 00:26:46,652
Thank you.

344
00:26:47,397 --> 00:26:48,773
Jasmine!

345
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:51,943
Welcome, we are so
happy to have you onboard.

346
00:26:52,199 --> 00:26:57,579
Oh, this is our ever gorgeous
head of promo and marketing.

347
00:26:58,105 --> 00:26:59,273
Sir Sephy.

348
00:26:59,607 --> 00:27:01,359
- Sir Sephy.
- Hi.

349
00:27:01,738 --> 00:27:05,365
Oh, I just need to borrow Anton for a
while. We need to discuss something.

350
00:27:12,575 --> 00:27:14,369
Congrats Miss Jasmine Reyes.

351
00:27:15,008 --> 00:27:16,885
And thank you Mister Tom.

352
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:17,886
Lopez.

353
00:27:18,175 --> 00:27:19,802
Welcome to Prima Beauty.

354
00:27:20,315 --> 00:27:22,442
You didn’t even bother
to say goodbye last time.

355
00:27:23,169 --> 00:27:25,338
‘Cause you were sound asleep.

356
00:27:25,363 --> 00:27:26,740
I didn’t want to wake you.

357
00:27:30,452 --> 00:27:33,163
So how are you and your secret girlfriend?

358
00:27:33,487 --> 00:27:34,739
Are you still together?

359
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:38,583
Apparently.

360
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,702
But I do want to thank you.

361
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:43,221
For you know, being there for me.

362
00:27:44,449 --> 00:27:47,660
Anyway, if you change
your mind, I’ll be here.

363
00:27:48,392 --> 00:27:49,602
Yes, that’s right.

364
00:27:51,002 --> 00:27:53,546
Maybe it’s just in the I don’t know.

365
00:27:58,222 --> 00:28:00,998
Especially now that we’re working together.

366
00:28:02,514 --> 00:28:03,765
Uhm, Jasmine.

367
00:28:03,765 --> 00:28:06,393
- This is Ryan Soriano, our COO.
- Hi.

368
00:28:06,778 --> 00:28:09,322
Jasmine, can I talk to you?

369
00:28:09,432 --> 00:28:10,475
Alone?

370
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:29,661
I know you.

371
00:30:30,435 --> 00:30:31,477
I know.

372
00:30:31,889 --> 00:30:33,933
And I’m here to congratulate you.

373
00:30:34,204 --> 00:30:36,373
And I want to remind you.

374
00:30:37,246 --> 00:30:39,123
That if you keep my secrets.

375
00:30:39,537 --> 00:30:40,808
I will keep yours.

376
00:30:43,216 --> 00:30:44,755
I understand.

377
00:30:46,328 --> 00:30:50,841
If you’ll be nice, I’ll return the favor.

378
00:30:53,064 --> 00:30:54,232
COO?

379
00:30:55,394 --> 00:30:57,175
That’s a pretty high position, right?

380
00:30:58,898 --> 00:31:01,901
So you’re holding onto
an important position.

381
00:31:02,253 --> 00:31:04,380
You have a name you’re protecting.

382
00:31:04,563 --> 00:31:06,565
So we both have a secret.

383
00:31:07,060 --> 00:31:11,216
Just to let you know,
I’m done with that life.

384
00:31:13,192 --> 00:31:14,289
How about you?

385
00:31:14,289 --> 00:31:15,364
Sir?

386
00:31:17,667 --> 00:31:23,606
Don’t worry, no one will know
you slept with a sixteen-year-old.

387
00:31:24,924 --> 00:31:27,606
Or was I seventeen back then?

388
00:31:34,001 --> 00:31:35,630
I’ll go ahead, Sir.

389
00:31:36,654 --> 00:31:38,184
Behave yourself.

390
00:32:04,184 --> 00:32:05,519
Are you done?

391
00:32:06,215 --> 00:32:07,800
Can I get my phone back?

392
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:10,637
Sorry, I just need to log out my account.

393
00:32:10,637 --> 00:32:12,096
It’s okay.

394
00:32:12,322 --> 00:32:13,406
Okay, here.

395
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:16,267
Thank you for letting me borrow your phone,
my battery was low.

396
00:32:16,640 --> 00:32:18,642
Hey, don’t forget your promise.

397
00:32:18,771 --> 00:32:20,565
You told me you’d do it.

398
00:32:21,147 --> 00:32:22,774
You said I can record you.

399
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,966
Of course, give me your phone.

400
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,328
Okay.

401
00:32:36,579 --> 00:32:38,331
Let’s do it?

402
00:32:38,456 --> 00:32:39,540
Let’s go.

403
00:33:33,594 --> 00:33:35,430
What do you think of Jasmine?

404
00:33:38,013 --> 00:33:41,432
I think you made the
right decision to pick her.

405
00:33:42,351 --> 00:33:44,770
She’s smart, she’s funny.

406
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:50,320
You know her?

407
00:33:51,891 --> 00:33:54,852
Streetlamp girl, right?
The one who went viral?

408
00:33:55,072 --> 00:33:58,867
I remember, she couldn’t let go of
your hand, ‘cause she was starstruck.

409
00:34:02,970 --> 00:34:04,179
Miss?

410
00:34:05,566 --> 00:34:07,360
Sorry.

411
00:34:07,790 --> 00:34:08,958
You again?

412
00:34:11,335 --> 00:34:12,712
She’s funny.

413
00:34:14,736 --> 00:34:16,779
There’s such a rule here?

414
00:34:16,804 --> 00:34:17,838
Yeah.

415
00:34:17,863 --> 00:34:20,611
- The loud guy.
- Oh okay.

416
00:34:22,987 --> 00:34:27,658
And she’s inspiring young
people to work hard and study hard.

417
00:34:42,801 --> 00:34:44,908
I think she’s the perfect Prima girl.

418
00:34:51,377 --> 00:34:52,428
What?

419
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:54,843
Christine

420
00:34:56,155 --> 00:34:57,799
I think we can make this work.

421
00:35:00,577 --> 00:35:03,371
Is this about your proposal?

422
00:35:03,685 --> 00:35:05,561
Aren’t we gonna talk about it?

423
00:35:11,585 --> 00:35:17,627
I thought you respected my
decision to take time to think about it.

424
00:35:19,413 --> 00:35:21,498
I know, but–

425
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:25,127
I just thought this could help you decide.

426
00:35:28,946 --> 00:35:29,947
Love.

427
00:35:31,917 --> 00:35:33,377
Don’t worry.

428
00:35:35,330 --> 00:35:37,249
I’m not looking for somebody else.

429
00:35:39,407 --> 00:35:41,493
You’re the only one for me.

430
00:35:41,939 --> 00:35:42,952
Okay?

431
00:35:45,210 --> 00:35:46,753
You’re the only one I love.

432
00:35:48,646 --> 00:35:50,398
If that’s what’s bothering you.

433
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:55,570
I just can’t give you
what you want right now.

434
00:36:20,949 --> 00:36:24,410
She’s really smart, but I don’t know.

435
00:36:24,736 --> 00:36:28,615
We don’t know her personally, we don’t know
what her background is.

436
00:36:29,102 --> 00:36:30,645
So what do you think, guys?

437
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:34,457
Actually, she has a clean background.

438
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:38,738
She has good grades and a clean record.

439
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,990
No scandals. No issues.

440
00:36:41,466 --> 00:36:45,178
I guess she’s perfect for our
girl-next-door image for Prima Beauty.

441
00:36:46,954 --> 00:36:48,581
There’s nothing to worry about.

442
00:36:49,055 --> 00:36:52,558
You were the one who picked
a drug addict model before.

443
00:36:53,186 --> 00:36:55,647
That was a big PR disaster.

444
00:36:55,872 --> 00:36:59,208
Exactly, that’s why I don’t
want that to happen again.

445
00:36:59,842 --> 00:37:03,349
We don’t know if it’s
just a good girl act or

446
00:37:03,349 --> 00:37:07,130
she just sold us on her
streetlamp girl image.

447
00:37:08,242 --> 00:37:09,827
She’s already hired.

448
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:12,724
So it means, she’s already cleared.

449
00:37:13,080 --> 00:37:16,334
The board already voted on
it, all they need to do is sign.

450
00:37:16,359 --> 00:37:18,402
So what are you worried about?

451
00:37:21,036 --> 00:37:22,042
Okay.

452
00:37:22,531 --> 00:37:24,283
So you all heard Madam.

453
00:37:24,450 --> 00:37:27,244
I guess we’ll work on our
next step at our next meeting.

454
00:37:28,237 --> 00:37:29,272
Sir Ryan?

455
00:37:29,807 --> 00:37:31,128
-Miss Christine?
-Yeah.

456
00:37:37,880 --> 00:37:39,131
Seriously?

457
00:37:39,423 --> 00:37:41,968
The company’s hiring
an idiot from social media

458
00:37:42,152 --> 00:37:45,947
who’s studying under a streetlamp,
and it's already considered a good image?

459
00:37:45,972 --> 00:37:47,807
She’s actually very smart.

460
00:37:48,202 --> 00:37:50,394
She has a degree in Business Management.

461
00:37:51,268 --> 00:37:54,522
And it looks like she reminds
Christine of her dead daughter.

462
00:37:55,705 --> 00:37:56,873
Yeah, right.

463
00:37:57,798 --> 00:38:00,259
I saw how she looked at Jasmine.

464
00:38:03,108 --> 00:38:06,403
That’s right, we can
use that against Christine.

465
00:38:06,760 --> 00:38:10,305
Mom, I don’t even want her in Prima.

466
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:11,790
I have to get rid of her.

467
00:38:12,886 --> 00:38:15,263
Why are you even defending her, Ryan?

468
00:38:16,080 --> 00:38:18,745
Mom, I'm just correcting you.

469
00:38:19,505 --> 00:38:22,299
She’s not stupid, but she’s dangerous.

470
00:38:23,438 --> 00:38:26,149
It could ruin me if she
stays, I can’t afford that.

471
00:38:28,723 --> 00:38:32,893
Out of all people, why does
she have something on you?

472
00:38:33,620 --> 00:38:37,457
I want to get dirt on
Christine, not on you.

473
00:38:37,482 --> 00:38:38,649
Wait.

474
00:38:39,947 --> 00:38:41,031
Speaking of,

475
00:38:41,378 --> 00:38:44,006
what’s the dirt you have on Christine?

476
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:50,327
My friend told me she saw
Christine the other day with some guy.

477
00:38:50,911 --> 00:38:54,498
I don’t know who the guy
is, that’s why I wanna find out.

478
00:38:55,900 --> 00:38:57,568
Like I told you before–

479
00:38:59,331 --> 00:39:02,034
If I can’t have you, nobody else can.

480
00:39:57,173 --> 00:40:00,301
Stop it Ryan, I’m your stepmom.

481
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:03,293
Aren’t you comfortable with me?

482
00:40:03,318 --> 00:40:06,405
I’ve always had a crush
on you, you know that?

483
00:40:15,963 --> 00:40:17,589
And there you have it everyone.

484
00:40:17,614 --> 00:40:20,284
Congratulations, Miss Jasmine Reyes.

485
00:40:20,309 --> 00:40:22,603
The new face of Prima Beauty.

486
00:40:22,628 --> 00:40:23,646
You know,

487
00:40:23,671 --> 00:40:26,674
you’re the reason why I
have the confidence now,

488
00:40:26,699 --> 00:40:29,160
because of your inspirational messages.

489
00:40:31,013 --> 00:40:32,181
Congrats.

490
00:40:38,589 --> 00:40:41,342
Love, we’re in the office.
