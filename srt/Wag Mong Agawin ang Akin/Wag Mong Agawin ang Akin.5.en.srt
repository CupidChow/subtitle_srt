1
00:00:04,946 --> 00:00:06,731
And there you have it everyone.

2
00:00:06,756 --> 00:00:09,217
Congratulations, Miss Jasmine Reyes.

3
00:00:09,217 --> 00:00:11,553
The new face of Prima Beauty.

4
00:00:12,445 --> 00:00:13,638
You know what,

5
00:00:13,976 --> 00:00:15,849
Prima has a new model.

6
00:00:15,874 --> 00:00:17,726
She’d be the same age as Lara if–

7
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,147
I believe we’ll meet again.

8
00:00:22,406 --> 00:00:26,234
You know, you’re the reason
why I have the confidence now,

9
00:00:26,259 --> 00:00:28,789
because of your inspirational messages.

10
00:00:30,655 --> 00:00:31,791
Congrats again.

11
00:00:31,816 --> 00:00:33,401
There’s something about him.

12
00:00:33,971 --> 00:00:36,250
It’s like there’s a connection between us.

13
00:00:38,327 --> 00:00:41,914
Love, we’re in the office.

14
00:00:48,655 --> 00:00:50,949
What’s the dirt you
have on Christine?

15
00:00:50,974 --> 00:00:53,136
She saw Christine the
other day with some guy.

16
00:00:53,724 --> 00:00:57,270
I don’t know who the guy
is, that’s why I wanna find out.

17
00:00:58,707 --> 00:01:01,128
Stop it Ryan, I’m your stepmom.

18
00:01:01,153 --> 00:01:03,825
Aren’t you comfortable with me?

19
00:01:03,850 --> 00:01:06,858
I’ve always had a crush
on you. You know that.

20
00:02:41,841 --> 00:02:43,343
Good morning.

21
00:02:44,299 --> 00:02:45,467
Morning.

22
00:02:49,918 --> 00:02:51,628
Thank you for not leaving.

23
00:02:52,737 --> 00:02:54,322
Are you okay now?

24
00:02:55,632 --> 00:02:58,098
I’m okay, thanks to you.

25
00:02:58,747 --> 00:03:00,222
How about you, are you okay?

26
00:03:05,738 --> 00:03:06,894
No.

27
00:03:07,395 --> 00:03:09,004
We’re being unfaithful.

28
00:03:12,551 --> 00:03:13,560
How about you?

29
00:03:14,112 --> 00:03:17,606
Do you feel okay
cheating on your girlfriend?

30
00:03:19,714 --> 00:03:21,038
Of course, I feel guilty.

31
00:03:21,214 --> 00:03:22,414
I love her.

32
00:03:25,764 --> 00:03:27,558
I’d like to ask you something.

33
00:03:42,433 --> 00:03:43,449
Hello?

34
00:04:02,468 --> 00:04:04,707
Didn’t she ask for an apology?

35
00:04:07,309 --> 00:04:10,308
She always tells me
that hiding our relationship

36
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:13,629
is for my benefit, for my protection,

37
00:04:13,654 --> 00:04:15,865
even this plan not to meet with each other.

38
00:04:19,050 --> 00:04:24,722
I want to marry her so that we can
face whatever her problems are, together.

39
00:04:26,581 --> 00:04:28,355
But her rejection.

40
00:04:29,279 --> 00:04:33,505
I don’t know. It feels like she doesn’t
believe that I can take care of her.

41
00:04:34,933 --> 00:04:37,410
I understand what she said

42
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:39,573
that I could be in danger.

43
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,651
But she doesn’t trust
that I can handle myself.

44
00:04:46,981 --> 00:04:48,652
That I can take care of myself,

45
00:04:48,878 --> 00:04:50,083
take care of her.

46
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,637
Why do you think she thinks that way?

47
00:04:55,333 --> 00:04:56,472
I don’t know.

48
00:04:56,984 --> 00:04:58,692
Is it because I’m younger?

49
00:04:59,509 --> 00:05:02,347
I know she’s not that shallow.

50
00:05:05,269 --> 00:05:07,454
But sometimes it just makes me wonder.

51
00:05:31,956 --> 00:05:35,835
Happy Birthday to you,

52
00:05:35,835 --> 00:05:40,590
Happy Birthday to you,

53
00:05:40,590 --> 00:05:48,514
Happy Birthday, Happy Birthday,
Happy Birthday to you,

54
00:05:55,426 --> 00:05:57,238
Mommy is sad.

55
00:05:59,215 --> 00:06:01,333
Because she can’t see

56
00:06:02,848 --> 00:06:04,882
the person she loves.

57
00:06:28,611 --> 00:06:33,009
But there’s this interesting person that
she‘d like to get to know more.

58
00:06:58,404 --> 00:06:59,572
Hello?

59
00:07:00,376 --> 00:07:01,824
Hello, Jasmine?

60
00:07:02,266 --> 00:07:03,643
It’s Christine.

61
00:07:07,517 --> 00:07:10,196
Why are you so nervous?

62
00:07:10,221 --> 00:07:12,365
Relax, it’s just the two of us.

63
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:15,821
This is a dream come true for me.

64
00:07:16,005 --> 00:07:18,610
To have coffee and have a meal with you.

65
00:07:19,329 --> 00:07:20,838
Like we’re friends.

66
00:07:22,294 --> 00:07:26,102
Actually, the reason I called you is
to see how you’re doing.

67
00:07:26,536 --> 00:07:27,971
How are you in Prima?

68
00:07:27,996 --> 00:07:31,064
How are the people treating you?

69
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:33,469
Everyone is so nice.

70
00:07:34,431 --> 00:07:37,071
So this is how the corporate world is?

71
00:07:37,481 --> 00:07:40,853
The CEO personally checks on their staff.

72
00:07:42,151 --> 00:07:45,837
I actually saw your pictures
during the perfume shoot.

73
00:07:46,209 --> 00:07:48,526
You were so amazing.

74
00:07:48,551 --> 00:07:51,235
You don’t seem like a beginner.

75
00:07:51,958 --> 00:07:54,923
You’re impressive and you make me proud.

76
00:07:54,948 --> 00:07:56,159
Good job.

77
00:07:56,184 --> 00:07:57,470
Thank you.

78
00:07:57,495 --> 00:08:01,522
The photographer was also helpful in
motivating me so I was able to do it well.

79
00:08:04,158 --> 00:08:11,025
Honestly, I don’t normally do this,
talking to talents outside of work.

80
00:08:12,235 --> 00:08:13,326
But

81
00:08:14,939 --> 00:08:16,120
I don’t know.

82
00:08:17,926 --> 00:08:19,803
I feel so comfortable with you.

83
00:08:21,654 --> 00:08:24,838
Really? Thank you, Miss Christine.

84
00:08:27,222 --> 00:08:29,517
You remind me of my daughter.

85
00:08:30,166 --> 00:08:31,563
You have a child?

86
00:08:34,009 --> 00:08:35,110
Before.

87
00:08:36,626 --> 00:08:40,422
I had a streak of bad luck many years ago.

88
00:08:42,250 --> 00:08:44,267
A lot of hardship.

89
00:08:45,534 --> 00:08:46,827
Losses.

90
00:08:48,743 --> 00:08:50,578
Lowest point of my life,

91
00:08:52,053 --> 00:08:54,173
was the time I lost my daughter.

92
00:08:55,867 --> 00:08:58,495
Benito, please I’m begging you.

93
00:08:59,348 --> 00:09:00,724
Lara!

94
00:09:04,735 --> 00:09:06,086
I’m so sorry.

95
00:09:07,765 --> 00:09:13,009
Uh, about your interview on
the Donatella Online in 2017,

96
00:09:13,576 --> 00:09:19,767
you said in your early twenties, “I’ve
suffered the most painful loss in my life.”

97
00:09:20,857 --> 00:09:24,533
Like life was suffocating you.

98
00:09:27,775 --> 00:09:31,086
You didn’t really explain
what you meant by “loss.”

99
00:09:31,414 --> 00:09:35,041
So I guess the people thought that it
was about your husband.

100
00:09:37,946 --> 00:09:42,853
Looks like you've been
following my life's journey.

101
00:09:43,345 --> 00:09:47,065
Of course, Miss Christine.
I’m your biggest fan.

102
00:09:47,368 --> 00:09:51,825
The hardship, the losses.

103
00:09:52,017 --> 00:09:53,715
I really felt it all.

104
00:09:54,665 --> 00:09:57,606
Hmm, it may not be the same but,

105
00:09:58,025 --> 00:10:01,976
I think I’ve also felt the
lowest point of my life.

106
00:10:02,119 --> 00:10:04,275
Let’s go. Come on!

107
00:10:15,768 --> 00:10:20,022
Was this the time you lost your parents?

108
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:25,333
Hmm not really, it was after that.

109
00:10:30,483 --> 00:10:32,360
Honestly,

110
00:10:33,003 --> 00:10:36,103
I don’t remember my parents anymore.

111
00:10:37,938 --> 00:10:42,908
I also can’t remember why they left me.

112
00:10:47,001 --> 00:10:49,986
All I remember is the hatred in my heart,

113
00:10:51,642 --> 00:10:53,798
because they left me alone.

114
00:10:58,064 --> 00:11:00,187
I was taken by a procurer.

115
00:11:02,479 --> 00:11:04,898
Po-procurer?

116
00:11:06,916 --> 00:11:09,502
Sorry, Miss Christine.
I’m being too emotional.

117
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:11,295
No, it’s okay. It’s okay.

118
00:11:11,320 --> 00:11:13,267
It’s all right with me if you open-up.

119
00:11:14,131 --> 00:11:17,134
It’s just that I remembered my parents.

120
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:19,843
I can’t help but feel emotional.

121
00:11:21,618 --> 00:11:24,704
Do you want to talk
about happy stuff instead?

122
00:11:26,409 --> 00:11:27,952
Sure, of course.

123
00:11:30,757 --> 00:11:31,883
Uhm.

124
00:11:33,180 --> 00:11:36,405
What advice can you give for my job?

125
00:11:37,213 --> 00:11:44,995
I’m a model but I have bigger dreams that’s
why I worked hard to finish my studies.

126
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,748
I have a degree.

127
00:11:49,814 --> 00:11:53,149
Okay then, listen carefully.

128
00:11:59,048 --> 00:12:00,086
Ryan.

129
00:12:00,728 --> 00:12:02,857
Come on, Mom. Why are you disturbing me?

130
00:12:03,048 --> 00:12:06,746
Can’t you at least make an effort to know
about the progress of the investigation?

131
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:09,979
Here.

132
00:12:10,783 --> 00:12:12,492
That’s the latest update.

133
00:12:12,517 --> 00:12:16,259
I don’t know if it’s connected to
Christine but it’s worth checking out.

134
00:12:40,250 --> 00:12:41,346
Miss, wait.

135
00:12:41,611 --> 00:12:43,262
Are you Annie San Jose?

136
00:12:44,056 --> 00:12:45,334
Who’s asking?

137
00:12:45,359 --> 00:12:48,814
My client who’s willing to pay
in exchange for information.

138
00:12:49,461 --> 00:12:52,322
You were the one collecting
stray kids before, right?

139
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:42,772
Her name’s Jasmine,

140
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:46,283
and she’s such a joy to be with.

141
00:13:48,694 --> 00:13:50,985
I told her that we should
see each other again.

142
00:13:52,748 --> 00:13:54,583
We’ve actually set a date already.

143
00:13:57,367 --> 00:13:59,369
I hope it’s okay with you

144
00:14:00,571 --> 00:14:02,819
that there’s someone
like Jasmine in my life.

145
00:14:04,546 --> 00:14:06,065
But honestly,

146
00:14:08,913 --> 00:14:10,729
I’m hoping that

147
00:14:12,968 --> 00:14:14,237
she’s you.

148
00:14:15,968 --> 00:14:17,984
You both look alike anyway.

149
00:14:22,569 --> 00:14:25,115
Marcus is still looking for you.

150
00:14:28,632 --> 00:14:30,214
I just hope.

151
00:14:34,607 --> 00:14:36,276
I just hope that he finds you.

152
00:14:56,270 --> 00:14:58,981
Oh, it’s already been four hours, huh?

153
00:14:59,616 --> 00:15:02,898
That’s why the waiter kept looking at us.

154
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,312
Don't worry, I’ll give them a big tip.

155
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:09,780
So that’s rule number 27, okay?

156
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:15,164
You should compensate the person
who provides you with good service.

157
00:15:15,546 --> 00:15:16,594
Okay?

158
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:18,937
I had fun Jasmine.

159
00:15:19,530 --> 00:15:21,198
I enjoyed your company.

160
00:15:21,341 --> 00:15:24,625
I enjoyed your company
more, Miss Christine.

161
00:15:25,492 --> 00:15:27,585
I wish you were my mother.

162
00:15:27,926 --> 00:15:30,139
My life would’ve been happier.

163
00:15:32,734 --> 00:15:33,833
Jasmine,

164
00:15:34,850 --> 00:15:36,160
what if

165
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:38,103
your parents suddenly came back?

166
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,743
Will you be able to forgive them?

167
00:15:42,030 --> 00:15:43,415
Even just one of them?

168
00:15:43,734 --> 00:15:44,818
Uhm.

169
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:48,989
Like your mom?

170
00:15:53,172 --> 00:15:54,382
I don’t know.

171
00:15:55,547 --> 00:15:57,647
It's hard to tell.

172
00:15:59,161 --> 00:16:02,132
But I think I’ll just choose

173
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:04,702
not to have them around.

174
00:16:06,961 --> 00:16:08,600
I’ve been used to it anyway.

175
00:16:10,914 --> 00:16:13,007
I lived without them.

176
00:16:13,798 --> 00:16:17,176
I can live longer even without them.

177
00:16:18,851 --> 00:16:19,910
I don’t know.

178
00:16:23,598 --> 00:16:25,014
I understand.

179
00:16:26,456 --> 00:16:30,168
I guess I’ll feel the same
way if I were in your shoes.

180
00:16:31,451 --> 00:16:33,140
But you know Jasmine,

181
00:16:34,308 --> 00:16:37,398
just because you had irresponsible parents,

182
00:16:39,300 --> 00:16:42,359
doesn’t mean there won’t
be any good parents for you.

183
00:16:44,867 --> 00:16:45,916
What?

184
00:16:47,676 --> 00:16:49,836
What I mean is

185
00:16:51,515 --> 00:16:53,190
if it’s okay with you,

186
00:16:53,378 --> 00:16:55,233
if it’s not too weird,

187
00:16:56,471 --> 00:16:58,556
you can treat me as your mother.

188
00:17:01,195 --> 00:17:02,427
Really?

189
00:17:03,829 --> 00:17:04,830
Here.

190
00:17:13,699 --> 00:17:14,700
Wow.

191
00:17:15,284 --> 00:17:17,077
Is this really for me?

192
00:17:17,812 --> 00:17:18,896
It’s yours.

193
00:17:19,676 --> 00:17:21,414
Thank you, Miss Christine.

194
00:17:22,053 --> 00:17:23,179
Here.

195
00:17:28,693 --> 00:17:29,860
Lara?

196
00:17:32,760 --> 00:17:34,219
It’s for my daughter.

197
00:17:36,676 --> 00:17:37,699
See.

198
00:17:38,821 --> 00:17:43,493
Every year, I’ve been buying her gifts
ever since I lost her.

199
00:17:44,574 --> 00:17:47,513
I never missed a birthday
without getting her something.

200
00:17:49,104 --> 00:17:50,188
Supposedly,

201
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:53,984
this is for her birthday this year.

202
00:17:56,950 --> 00:18:00,162
But I guess it will just be a dream for me
to have her wear this.

203
00:18:04,058 --> 00:18:05,379
Back then

204
00:18:08,054 --> 00:18:09,306
I couldn’t afford it.

205
00:18:10,795 --> 00:18:12,489
But now that I can afford it,

206
00:18:13,857 --> 00:18:14,942
she’s gone.

207
00:18:20,974 --> 00:18:23,393
So this is really important to you.

208
00:18:25,187 --> 00:18:27,272
Why are you giving it to me?

209
00:18:30,533 --> 00:18:33,552
Think of it as a gift from Lara.

210
00:18:35,524 --> 00:18:37,512
A reminder that

211
00:18:37,942 --> 00:18:40,802
even if you’re missing
a big part in your heart,

212
00:18:42,436 --> 00:18:46,273
you’ll still find something
precious from what she left.

213
00:18:48,645 --> 00:18:50,730
Thank you, Miss Christine.

214
00:18:51,556 --> 00:18:53,692
And thank you to Lara.

215
00:18:56,468 --> 00:19:03,559
Remember that I’m just here if
you need to talk or you need advice.

216
00:19:13,678 --> 00:19:15,012
Come here.

217
00:19:15,291 --> 00:19:16,834
I’ll help you wear it.

218
00:19:18,139 --> 00:19:19,908
Take care of it, okay?

219
00:19:21,816 --> 00:19:23,735
It suits you very well.

220
00:19:34,076 --> 00:19:39,873
Welcome to the launch of Prima’s newest
perfume line, Scent of Summer.

221
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,945
It’s so nice here, right?

222
00:19:42,806 --> 00:19:44,224
So many handsome boys.

223
00:19:45,017 --> 00:19:46,059
Really handsome.

224
00:19:46,421 --> 00:19:48,204
Look at the way he stares at you.

225
00:19:48,229 --> 00:19:49,813
What are you talking about?

226
00:19:49,838 --> 00:19:51,631
Stop staring, you’ve seen me naked anyway.

227
00:19:51,907 --> 00:19:53,961
You look better with your clothes on.

228
00:19:54,258 --> 00:19:55,736
You’re such a flirt, huh?

229
00:19:55,736 --> 00:19:57,963
- You’re a flirt, too.
- Bro. Miss Christine is here.

230
00:19:57,988 --> 00:19:59,698
Let me join you, I wanna see her.

231
00:20:01,649 --> 00:20:06,094
Sis, oh my god. Look around.

232
00:20:06,119 --> 00:20:07,414
Hi, Miss Christine.

233
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:08,832
- Hi, Chelsea.
- Hi.

234
00:20:08,914 --> 00:20:10,125
Hi.

235
00:20:10,320 --> 00:20:12,281
Look Sis, it’s so pretty.

236
00:20:12,468 --> 00:20:13,651
Congratulations.

237
00:20:14,814 --> 00:20:15,857
Thank you.

238
00:20:20,227 --> 00:20:21,485
Miss Christine.

239
00:20:22,069 --> 00:20:23,570
Jasmine.

240
00:20:23,766 --> 00:20:25,560
I’m glad you’re here too.

241
00:20:26,697 --> 00:20:28,615
Can’t I have fun as well?

242
00:20:37,554 --> 00:20:38,752
Are you okay?

243
00:20:39,641 --> 00:20:40,948
Why do you ask?

244
00:20:40,973 --> 00:20:42,257
What’s the problem?

245
00:20:42,282 --> 00:20:44,201
Are you and your girlfriend still talking?

246
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:45,880
Not yet.

247
00:20:48,117 --> 00:20:50,254
Since when did you become
close with Miss Christine?

248
00:20:51,578 --> 00:20:52,657
Last week.

249
00:20:53,087 --> 00:20:56,174
But we’ve felt comfortable
with each other ever since.

250
00:20:56,992 --> 00:21:00,464
You know, you should cherish that.
Miss Christine isn’t like that with others.

251
00:21:00,489 --> 00:21:02,758
She chooses who she can trust.

252
00:21:02,783 --> 00:21:03,977
Really?

253
00:21:04,721 --> 00:21:06,615
I guess I really am so lucky.

254
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:08,533
Have you seen Anton and Ericka?

255
00:21:08,558 --> 00:21:10,978
I also can’t find Marie.

256
00:21:42,079 --> 00:21:43,460
It’s really hot today.

257
00:21:43,825 --> 00:21:45,921
Look at you, you’re sweating–

258
00:21:47,194 --> 00:21:49,275
Why, what’s your problem?

259
00:21:50,353 --> 00:21:52,570
You were just flirting with me earlier.

260
00:21:52,595 --> 00:21:54,765
Now it’s like you’re disgusted with me.

261
00:21:56,514 --> 00:21:58,562
Is your girlfriend here?

262
00:21:59,856 --> 00:22:01,441
Sorry, I just have a lot on my mind.

263
00:23:05,485 --> 00:23:06,502
Sis,

264
00:23:07,311 --> 00:23:09,836
are you and Tom just
going to ignore each other?

265
00:23:11,543 --> 00:23:12,569
Yes.

266
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,601
Just like in the office.

267
00:23:15,769 --> 00:23:18,688
Good thing you can endure it.

268
00:23:18,688 --> 00:23:20,524
Especially since you work together.

269
00:23:24,493 --> 00:23:26,055
There’s no other choice.

270
00:24:01,801 --> 00:24:03,305
Oh my god, Sis.

271
00:24:03,751 --> 00:24:06,309
My dad almost caught me.

272
00:24:06,334 --> 00:24:10,118
Vince persisted to take me home since
my car was under traffic restrictions.

273
00:24:10,143 --> 00:24:12,968
Of course, we kissed
goodbye inside the car and then,

274
00:24:12,993 --> 00:24:15,744
right after, my dad went
outside. It was so crazy.

275
00:24:15,744 --> 00:24:16,861
Oh my god.

276
00:24:16,886 --> 00:24:19,139
I know, my god.

277
00:24:19,431 --> 00:24:20,675
You know what,

278
00:24:20,873 --> 00:24:23,884
I just wish that we don’t have to keep
secrets anymore, right?

279
00:24:25,961 --> 00:24:27,144
I agree.

280
00:24:29,137 --> 00:24:32,079
I wish there weren't
a lot of complications.

281
00:24:34,149 --> 00:24:35,202
I know.

282
00:26:08,340 --> 00:26:10,164
What the fuck, man. What was that?

283
00:26:10,189 --> 00:26:12,817
Bro, Ericka and I were
just having fun with Marie.

284
00:26:12,842 --> 00:26:14,825
With Marie, huh? With Marie.

285
00:26:14,850 --> 00:26:17,761
Yeah, well I’m in an
open relationship anyway.

286
00:26:17,786 --> 00:26:18,918
Besides,

287
00:26:18,952 --> 00:26:20,578
we really like to experiment.

288
00:26:27,051 --> 00:26:28,292
Why so serious?

289
00:26:31,925 --> 00:26:35,129
What do you call it when you love someone,

290
00:26:35,154 --> 00:26:37,075
but you’re also attracted to someone else?

291
00:26:41,034 --> 00:26:42,130
That’s cool.

292
00:26:42,702 --> 00:26:44,926
That’s exactly why I’m
in an open relationship.

293
00:26:45,091 --> 00:26:46,191
right?

294
00:26:46,513 --> 00:26:47,763
Now that I think about it.

295
00:26:49,281 --> 00:26:52,778
But we are young consenting adults.

296
00:26:53,046 --> 00:26:55,536
We tend to get attracted

297
00:26:56,099 --> 00:26:57,626
to where there’s more excitement.

298
00:26:57,964 --> 00:26:59,442
Just like you with Jasmine.

299
00:27:00,316 --> 00:27:01,402
Maybe.

300
00:27:02,370 --> 00:27:05,060
I mean, we’re all looking for true love.

301
00:27:06,082 --> 00:27:08,200
It’s just that not all can stay faithful.

302
00:27:08,666 --> 00:27:10,763
Like you, with your girlfriend.

303
00:27:11,942 --> 00:27:16,786
So until Ericka and I can finally
be faithful with each other,

304
00:27:17,880 --> 00:27:19,692
we’ll just stay in this set up.

305
00:27:29,230 --> 00:27:32,484
Here, let’s stay here to avoid the noise.

306
00:27:35,437 --> 00:27:37,940
Really, you’ve never had a boyfriend?

307
00:27:37,965 --> 00:27:39,631
With your beauty?

308
00:27:40,390 --> 00:27:41,516
I really haven’t.

309
00:27:42,514 --> 00:27:43,974
No one has attempted.

310
00:27:45,194 --> 00:27:48,381
Don’t say that, you’re a wonderful lady.

311
00:27:48,875 --> 00:27:52,670
Maybe there hasn’t been
anyone who deserves you yet.

312
00:27:54,476 --> 00:27:57,646
I’m actually dating someone.

313
00:27:58,457 --> 00:28:00,668
But we’re just starting.

314
00:28:03,644 --> 00:28:07,670
We’re not okay right now since he has
his other priorities.

315
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:13,117
The problem is, I really like him.

316
00:28:15,850 --> 00:28:18,371
This is my first time feeling
this way, Miss Christine.

317
00:28:18,974 --> 00:28:22,769
I like him so much that it’s
starting to affect my work.

318
00:28:27,505 --> 00:28:29,878
Do you have any advice for me?

319
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:32,419
Have you felt this way too?

320
00:28:34,425 --> 00:28:35,760
Believe it or not,

321
00:28:37,061 --> 00:28:38,083
yes.

322
00:28:38,108 --> 00:28:39,985
And I can totally relate.

323
00:28:41,693 --> 00:28:43,278
What I can say is,

324
00:28:43,995 --> 00:28:45,830
if you aren’t his priority,

325
00:28:46,516 --> 00:28:47,726
then leave.

326
00:28:50,027 --> 00:28:54,157
It’s hard to get stuck in
a one-way relationship.

327
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:57,360
Even if I love him?

328
00:29:00,363 --> 00:29:04,951
Sometimes you just have to let go of people
for many different reasons.

329
00:29:07,177 --> 00:29:09,679
If he can't give you what you need,

330
00:29:10,610 --> 00:29:11,986
then let go.

331
00:29:12,935 --> 00:29:16,730
Because it won’t help
you grow as an individual.

332
00:29:18,899 --> 00:29:21,360
I’ve given up a lot for my career.

333
00:29:22,569 --> 00:29:24,612
And I don’t think I’ll stop,

334
00:29:24,637 --> 00:29:26,694
because this is all I have.

335
00:29:30,231 --> 00:29:32,650
Well, what did your boyfriend say?

336
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:34,182
Huh?

337
00:29:34,814 --> 00:29:39,819
I mean, what did he say when you
chose your career over him?

338
00:29:41,149 --> 00:29:42,859
I don’t have a boyfriend.

339
00:29:43,698 --> 00:29:46,409
Like I said, I’ve let go of them.

340
00:29:47,401 --> 00:29:49,528
I want to focus more on Prima.

341
00:29:49,871 --> 00:29:54,292
Instead of focusing on people that
can possibly ruin my plans in life.

342
00:30:14,123 --> 00:30:15,152
Hello?

343
00:30:15,177 --> 00:30:16,387
Hello, Christine.

344
00:30:17,732 --> 00:30:19,192
Can we talk later?

345
00:30:23,038 --> 00:30:24,081
Sure.

346
00:30:25,937 --> 00:30:27,075
I miss you.

347
00:30:27,784 --> 00:30:29,077
I miss you, too.

348
00:30:32,836 --> 00:30:34,546
Are you still mad at me?

349
00:30:35,901 --> 00:30:38,195
You know I don’t get mad at you.

350
00:30:39,508 --> 00:30:41,719
But until when are we
going to be like this?

351
00:30:46,636 --> 00:30:47,845
I don’t know.

352
00:30:49,556 --> 00:30:52,141
Tin, let’s fight for this.

353
00:30:53,725 --> 00:30:55,852
I’m not scared of Ryan.

354
00:30:57,114 --> 00:30:59,325
I’m not scared of anyone.

355
00:31:00,436 --> 00:31:04,440
Let me face the challenges for both of us.

356
00:31:07,739 --> 00:31:09,408
I don’t want to risk it, Tom.

357
00:31:11,181 --> 00:31:13,296
I don’t fall for just anyone.

358
00:31:14,616 --> 00:31:17,109
But I always lose the people I love

359
00:31:18,454 --> 00:31:21,332
whenever I take risks.

360
00:31:23,910 --> 00:31:26,079
I already lost my daughter.

361
00:31:29,196 --> 00:31:32,157
I can’t afford to lose you too.

362
00:31:32,717 --> 00:31:33,849
Okay?

363
00:31:35,705 --> 00:31:36,873
I can’t.

364
00:31:38,281 --> 00:31:39,907
I won’t let it happen.

365
00:31:43,187 --> 00:31:44,939
I love you so much, Tin.

366
00:31:45,549 --> 00:31:47,300
Don’t push me away.

367
00:31:50,178 --> 00:31:52,472
I really love you too, Tom.

368
00:32:02,670 --> 00:32:05,187
Our set up stays the same, okay?

369
00:32:06,611 --> 00:32:09,390
We still can’t see each other until

370
00:32:10,345 --> 00:32:12,406
everything cools down.

371
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:15,433
I know.

372
00:32:19,647 --> 00:32:21,774
Thank you for understanding.

373
00:34:27,710 --> 00:34:30,004
I didn’t mean to deceive you.

374
00:34:30,539 --> 00:34:32,708
And to ruin your relationship with Tom.

375
00:34:35,927 --> 00:34:37,262
I don’t have a boyfriend.

376
00:34:38,391 --> 00:34:40,768
Like I said, I’ve let go of them.

377
00:34:43,593 --> 00:34:47,973
Instead of focusing on people that
can possibly ruin my plans in life.

378
00:34:48,419 --> 00:34:50,396
You really love your girlfriend, don’t you?

379
00:34:50,421 --> 00:34:52,340
Would I propose if I don’t?

380
00:35:11,092 --> 00:35:13,139
But I don’t understand,

381
00:35:13,501 --> 00:35:15,943
you said you didn’t have someone you love.

382
00:35:19,989 --> 00:35:22,607
Didn't you say that it'd
only complicate your plans?

383
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:05,990
Yo!

384
00:37:06,015 --> 00:37:07,600
Can’t get a ride? Hop in.

385
00:37:07,625 --> 00:37:09,076
I booked one already.

386
00:37:09,101 --> 00:37:11,062
You booked a ride or a client?

387
00:37:13,203 --> 00:37:15,463
I think we should stop this.

388
00:37:15,488 --> 00:37:17,993
I know Miss Christine is your girlfriend.

389
00:37:18,170 --> 00:37:19,879
I don’t want to deceive her.

390
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:23,199
I don't want to make myself believe
that we can be together.

391
00:37:23,812 --> 00:37:24,967
Hello, Boss Ryan.

392
00:37:24,992 --> 00:37:26,946
I got Tom and Jasmine’s picture.

393
00:37:26,971 --> 00:37:28,087
Well, what do you know?

394
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,806
A mother and daughter
hooking up with the same guy.

395
00:37:30,831 --> 00:37:32,282
If only they knew.

396
00:37:41,623 --> 00:37:42,869
This is you, right?

397
00:37:42,894 --> 00:37:44,272
Are you tired of me?

398
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:46,202
That’s why you replaced
me with someone younger?

399
00:37:46,227 --> 00:37:47,803
Are you not happy with me?

400
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:54,093
I just want you to be my wife.

401
00:38:03,616 --> 00:38:05,677
So you know what’s going
on between me and Tom.

402
00:38:05,702 --> 00:38:06,843
Look me in the eye.

403
00:38:06,868 --> 00:38:08,640
Look me in the eye.
