1
00:00:56,477 --> 00:00:59,188
- You feel so good. Fuck.
- Faster.

2
00:01:00,393 --> 00:01:03,563
- Just like that. Keep going.
- Your butt feels nice.

3
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:06,816
Right there. Keep going.

4
00:01:30,882 --> 00:01:33,551
Keep going.

5
00:01:36,596 --> 00:01:38,264
You feel so good.

6
00:01:46,064 --> 00:01:47,273
You feel so good.

7
00:01:47,298 --> 00:01:48,309
Almost there.

8
00:01:48,334 --> 00:01:49,356
Almost there.

9
00:01:49,513 --> 00:01:50,597
Almost there.

10
00:02:19,115 --> 00:02:20,283
I love you.

11
00:02:23,666 --> 00:02:24,917
I love you.

12
00:02:27,638 --> 00:02:28,764
Here you go.

13
00:02:29,058 --> 00:02:30,066
Thanks…

14
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,819
Your rate is expensive but it was worth it.

15
00:02:33,009 --> 00:02:34,218
What was your name again?

16
00:02:34,243 --> 00:02:35,363
Jasmine.

17
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:37,124
I’ll see you next time.

18
00:02:38,579 --> 00:02:39,613
Take care.

19
00:02:41,134 --> 00:02:42,168
Love.

20
00:02:44,286 --> 00:02:49,750
Don’t wait for me, okay?
I still need to review the reports.

21
00:02:50,813 --> 00:02:53,566
If you want, you can just go home. Hmm?

22
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:58,177
I love you.

23
00:02:58,607 --> 00:02:59,650
I love you.

24
00:05:11,066 --> 00:05:12,359
Psst, Jasmine.

25
00:05:14,423 --> 00:05:20,137
Oh my, it’s Miss Christine Soriano.
Thank you, Marie. I love you.

26
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:23,111
I forgot to buy it earlier
because I was so busy.

27
00:05:24,042 --> 00:05:25,669
She’s so pretty, right?

28
00:05:26,028 --> 00:05:28,912
Yeah. When I saw her face in the magazine,
I bought it immediately.

29
00:05:28,937 --> 00:05:30,038
She’s your idol, right?

30
00:05:30,063 --> 00:05:32,649
Of course, I actually
really want to meet her.

31
00:05:33,283 --> 00:05:35,619
It’s amazing how she
turned her life around.

32
00:05:35,957 --> 00:05:37,500
I was inspired by the saying–

33
00:05:37,962 --> 00:05:42,842
“Even if you’re going through a rough time,
you can still keep on dreaming.”

34
00:05:42,867 --> 00:05:44,201
You’re right.

35
00:05:44,201 --> 00:05:46,530
-This is why you’re my best friend.
- Ow! Stop shaking me.

36
00:05:46,554 --> 00:05:48,431
I feel sore.

37
00:05:48,431 --> 00:05:49,682
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

38
00:05:49,724 --> 00:05:51,701
There were so many
requests, it was so annoying.

39
00:05:51,726 --> 00:05:52,760
You know.

40
00:05:52,979 --> 00:05:55,982
I kinda feel sore too,

41
00:05:56,282 --> 00:05:58,910
even if the sex earlier wasn’t too rough.

42
00:05:59,012 --> 00:06:00,888
Seriously, do you wanna know why?

43
00:06:01,016 --> 00:06:03,185
What’s inside that bag of
yours? Are there rocks in it?

44
00:06:03,613 --> 00:06:04,947
- Oh, shit.
- See, it’s so heavy.

45
00:06:05,025 --> 00:06:06,276
What time is it?

46
00:06:06,795 --> 00:06:07,813
Eleven.

47
00:06:08,532 --> 00:06:10,909
Shit. We have a deadline later.

48
00:06:11,127 --> 00:06:12,220
Wait.

49
00:06:12,288 --> 00:06:14,832
- Hey, Jasmine. Jasmine.
- I need to– My professor is so–

50
00:06:14,869 --> 00:06:17,226
Excuse me, may I sit
here? I just need to study.

51
00:06:17,251 --> 00:06:18,628
- Hey! Get up.
- I won’t take long.

52
00:06:18,669 --> 00:06:20,068
- Let’s find a convenience store
- My professor is so strict,

53
00:06:20,068 --> 00:06:21,982
- where you can sit properly.
- I need to finish this.

54
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,925
- You’re so stubborn, stand up. Let’s go.
- I’ll be quick.

55
00:06:23,925 --> 00:06:24,926
Promise.

56
00:06:24,967 --> 00:06:26,469
- I’ll just do some proofreading
- You are so stubborn.

57
00:06:26,546 --> 00:06:28,506
and edit some stuff, then I’m done.

58
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,114
You have access to the internet, right?

59
00:06:30,139 --> 00:06:33,059
Let me connect to it. You have
unlimited data credits, right?

60
00:06:33,429 --> 00:06:34,463
Of course.

61
00:06:34,815 --> 00:06:36,692
Thank you. Thank you.

62
00:06:37,381 --> 00:06:38,456
Here you go.

63
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,900
Wow, You’re automatically connected.

64
00:06:40,925 --> 00:06:41,985
Of course.

65
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:43,094
Okay.

66
00:07:27,873 --> 00:07:28,923
Morning.

67
00:07:29,734 --> 00:07:30,741
Good morning, ma’am.

68
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:31,750
Morning.

69
00:07:32,663 --> 00:07:33,675
Good morning, ma’am.

70
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:34,784
Morning.

71
00:07:35,079 --> 00:07:36,122
Good morning, ma’am.

72
00:07:36,147 --> 00:07:37,214
Morning.

73
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,451
- Morning.
- Good morning, ma’am.

74
00:08:00,518 --> 00:08:01,727
Good morning, ma’am.

75
00:08:01,856 --> 00:08:02,940
Morning.

76
00:08:04,026 --> 00:08:05,111
Good morning, ma’am.

77
00:08:05,136 --> 00:08:06,137
Good morning.

78
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:08,504
Good morning, ma’am.

79
00:08:08,529 --> 00:08:11,908
You should quit that secret crush you have
for Miss Christine, okay?

80
00:08:12,462 --> 00:08:13,588
It’s hopeless.

81
00:08:14,219 --> 00:08:17,056
Besides, she’s way up high now,
she won’t be looking down anymore.

82
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,710
Good morning, ma’am.

83
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:22,285
Prepare all my meetings for the day.

84
00:08:22,444 --> 00:08:24,321
There’s nothing wrong
with just looking, right?

85
00:08:27,503 --> 00:08:28,595
I’ll go ahead.

86
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:29,712
All right.

87
00:08:31,435 --> 00:08:34,021
Sis, can you stop being so upset?

88
00:08:35,009 --> 00:08:39,138
Of course, we’re selling beauty products,
so their focus is about beauty.

89
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:43,908
And, just think of it as a compliment.
The tagline is quite vague anyway.

90
00:08:51,404 --> 00:08:53,240
That’s not the point, Sephy.

91
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:57,036
The reason I allowed that
magazine to feature me

92
00:08:57,549 --> 00:09:01,094
was because I want to become
an inspiration to the readers.

93
00:09:02,372 --> 00:09:06,042
That I never gave up on any challenges
that came into my life.

94
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:08,172
But how will I do that

95
00:09:08,781 --> 00:09:11,968
if they think that I became
successful just because of my beauty?

96
00:09:13,051 --> 00:09:16,304
Well sis, you are actually really pretty.

97
00:09:17,982 --> 00:09:19,191
And what can we do?

98
00:09:19,991 --> 00:09:22,452
It’s a man behind the
desk in that magazine.

99
00:09:23,470 --> 00:09:25,347
And just to make you feel better–

100
00:09:26,005 --> 00:09:27,798
It’s a dying medium.

101
00:09:27,992 --> 00:09:32,245
Of course, they’ll go for desperate
moves to trend, just to survive.

102
00:09:32,491 --> 00:09:34,118
Just like what your ex-husband did.

103
00:09:35,292 --> 00:09:36,877
May his soul rest in peace.

104
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:38,864
I mean–

105
00:09:39,974 --> 00:09:44,771
You’re the real reason why the
company survived from his bad leadership.

106
00:09:47,487 --> 00:09:48,822
The people who matter

107
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:51,181
know your true worth.

108
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:53,345
don’t forget that.

109
00:09:56,511 --> 00:09:57,679
Thank you, Sephy.

110
00:09:58,923 --> 00:10:04,012
I’ll make sure that I will not break
that trust that you guys gave me.

111
00:10:04,304 --> 00:10:05,930
Of course, there you go.

112
00:10:11,269 --> 00:10:12,645
Ryan.

113
00:10:12,670 --> 00:10:13,737
Mom.

114
00:10:16,574 --> 00:10:17,992
What’s up? What brings you here?

115
00:10:20,236 --> 00:10:21,821
Can’t I just visit my son?

116
00:10:22,238 --> 00:10:26,159
Mom, come on. Can you spare me the drama?
I know you need something from me.

117
00:10:26,635 --> 00:10:27,703
What is it?

118
00:10:29,245 --> 00:10:32,040
It’s just that I was out one night.

119
00:10:32,707 --> 00:10:34,375
Then I saw Christine.

120
00:10:35,210 --> 00:10:38,630
She was with her widowed friend, Hilda.

121
00:10:39,923 --> 00:10:42,175
And they were with this guy.

122
00:10:42,592 --> 00:10:44,177
A younger guy, actually.

123
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:47,430
Do you think that’s her boyfriend?

124
00:10:47,722 --> 00:10:50,058
Mom, what is this about?

125
00:10:53,561 --> 00:10:55,104
It’s worth checking out.

126
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,066
Maybe we can make a scandal out of it?

127
00:10:58,107 --> 00:10:58,900
Hmm.

128
00:10:59,752 --> 00:11:00,786
Come on.

129
00:11:01,903 --> 00:11:04,030
It’s been what? Fourteen years?

130
00:11:04,554 --> 00:11:08,516
Aren’t you going to stop looking for a way
to kick Christine out of Prima?

131
00:11:09,118 --> 00:11:11,120
You’re the only one preventing it.

132
00:11:11,663 --> 00:11:14,832
You know that you can
convince the board to buy her out.

133
00:11:15,625 --> 00:11:18,836
I just don’t understand why you’re
being so kind to that stepmother of yours.

134
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:19,862
Mom.

135
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,132
As long as I'm here

136
00:11:24,008 --> 00:11:25,718
Prima will be hers.

137
00:11:27,470 --> 00:11:28,680
You know that

138
00:11:29,138 --> 00:11:30,390
this is all she has.

139
00:11:30,807 --> 00:11:32,559
Anyway, I have a lot to do.

140
00:11:33,184 --> 00:11:36,521
We’ll be launching a new
perfume line under Prima so–

141
00:11:37,105 --> 00:11:38,314
I’m busy.

142
00:11:40,743 --> 00:11:41,793
Whatever.

143
00:11:41,818 --> 00:11:42,852
Bye!

144
00:12:03,548 --> 00:12:07,802
I thought it was just for the ‘gram?
You’re actually really studious.

145
00:12:08,469 --> 00:12:11,222
Don’t disturb her, she’s still studying.

146
00:12:11,556 --> 00:12:16,311
Oh, come on, don’t worry about it. You guys
can keep talking, I can still concentrate.

147
00:12:16,602 --> 00:12:19,063
You know, girl, we’re proud of you.

148
00:12:19,063 --> 00:12:21,566
It’s good that you’re
continuing with your studies.

149
00:12:23,067 --> 00:12:25,653
Well, Miss Christine Soriano said that–

150
00:12:25,653 --> 00:12:28,740
Education is one of the things
we shouldn’t be ashamed of.”

151
00:12:29,111 --> 00:12:34,116
After I graduate, I’ll make
sure to work for Prima.

152
00:12:34,704 --> 00:12:40,376
Wow, go for it. In my case, I have to let
my siblings finish their studies first.

153
00:12:40,626 --> 00:12:42,712
Besides, they said I’m not that smart.

154
00:12:43,421 --> 00:12:44,714
You got that right.

155
00:12:44,922 --> 00:12:47,717
Well, I tried to apply for a different job,

156
00:12:47,925 --> 00:12:51,304
but nothing happened.
I still came back to this.

157
00:12:51,387 --> 00:12:54,682
That’s why I’m just
having fun with this job.

158
00:12:54,849 --> 00:12:56,768
I don’t know what else to do.

159
00:12:56,934 --> 00:13:00,063
If I’m not going to enjoy it, I
might have given up on life.

160
00:13:10,861 --> 00:13:13,534
Jasmine.

161
00:13:14,369 --> 00:13:17,622
Help! Help!

162
00:13:20,166 --> 00:13:21,184
Jasmine.

163
00:13:21,876 --> 00:13:23,686
Remove those cycling shorts you’re wearing.

164
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,500
Last time, a customer complained that
you were still wearing one.

165
00:13:28,383 --> 00:13:31,427
Well, ma’am, my cycling
shorts are see-through anyway.

166
00:13:31,761 --> 00:13:35,640
Still, don’t wear one
today. Just do what I say.

167
00:13:35,681 --> 00:13:37,809
How are you going to get more customers?

168
00:13:38,893 --> 00:13:42,313
Girl, you’re wearing cycling shorts even
if you’ll just take it off later?

169
00:13:45,149 --> 00:13:46,818
What’s the point?

170
00:13:59,914 --> 00:14:01,624
Guys, let’s go.

171
00:14:01,624 --> 00:14:05,086
Hi, Sir, good evening. Come on, girls.

172
00:14:06,254 --> 00:14:10,925
Aren’t they all pretty? Go ahead and
sit beside them… Sit beside them, go.

173
00:14:10,925 --> 00:14:12,009
Sit there.

174
00:14:12,176 --> 00:14:13,886
Entertain them, okay?

175
00:14:13,970 --> 00:14:15,680
They have to enjoy tonight.

176
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:17,348
Well, sir, enjoy!

177
00:14:17,348 --> 00:14:18,724
Thanks. Thanks.

178
00:14:20,059 --> 00:14:21,686
Are you sure they aren’t underage?

179
00:14:21,686 --> 00:14:24,480
Dude, they’re legit. Trust me.

180
00:14:26,107 --> 00:14:31,654
Ah girls, girls, well? Do you have any
secret talents? Singing, dancing, poems?

181
00:14:32,196 --> 00:14:36,617
We’re celebrating the promotion of
our trainee to being a regular employee.

182
00:14:36,893 --> 00:14:37,961
Who?

183
00:14:39,304 --> 00:14:40,605
- Wow, congratulations!
- Right.

184
00:14:40,630 --> 00:14:41,389
Thank you.

185
00:14:41,414 --> 00:14:43,207
Well then, let’s forget about
our girlfriends for tonight.

186
00:14:43,287 --> 00:14:44,997
And just drink. Go ahead and drink.

187
00:14:45,246 --> 00:14:49,417
Here, drink. drink, drink. Here you go.

188
00:14:50,774 --> 00:14:51,983
May I know your name?

189
00:14:52,008 --> 00:14:53,426
Can I book a room with you?

190
00:14:53,509 --> 00:14:54,510
Yeah, sure.

191
00:14:54,594 --> 00:14:56,596
Dude, That was quick.

192
00:14:56,976 --> 00:14:59,187
Just kidding, go ahead.

193
00:14:59,806 --> 00:15:00,882
It’s okay.

194
00:15:00,927 --> 00:15:01,936
Cheers?

195
00:15:16,824 --> 00:15:18,075
Bye, ma’am.

196
00:15:18,201 --> 00:15:19,285
Bye.

197
00:15:22,538 --> 00:15:23,748
Christine.

198
00:15:24,707 --> 00:15:25,958
What do you want?

199
00:15:27,460 --> 00:15:29,212
Are you mad at me again?

200
00:15:33,007 --> 00:15:36,344
You know I’m the only
reason you’re still here, right?

201
00:15:39,787 --> 00:15:41,789
Let go of me.

202
00:15:44,987 --> 00:15:46,530
Like I told you before–

203
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:50,441
If I can’t have you, nobody else can.

204
00:15:52,235 --> 00:15:56,447
If you want to stay longer in this company,
you’ll behave yourself.

205
00:15:58,092 --> 00:15:59,426
Just saying.

206
00:16:01,306 --> 00:16:03,820
Just make one little mistake, Christine.

207
00:16:25,935 --> 00:16:27,228
There’s no need.

208
00:16:27,812 --> 00:16:29,021
If that’s what you want.

209
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:31,315
I didn’t book you to have sex with me.

210
00:16:31,857 --> 00:16:33,943
Why? Do you think it’s dirty?

211
00:16:34,193 --> 00:16:37,572
I never thought about that.
I just have a girlfriend so I can’t.

212
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,284
So, why did you book me?

213
00:16:41,742 --> 00:16:43,995
I just wanted to avoid
the noise downstairs.

214
00:16:46,080 --> 00:16:48,165
That’s easy, just go home.

215
00:16:48,791 --> 00:16:50,543
I wouldn’t want to be a buzz-kill.

216
00:16:53,379 --> 00:16:57,466
Aren’t you already? You
not wanting to have sex?

217
00:16:58,009 --> 00:17:00,177
I know that you also
just wanted a breather.

218
00:17:00,469 --> 00:17:02,722
I noticed you were uncomfortable earlier.

219
00:17:04,932 --> 00:17:07,059
Why would I be uncomfortable?

220
00:17:07,084 --> 00:17:09,670
You guys are my customers, this is my job.

221
00:17:19,322 --> 00:17:23,618
See you soon, Love.

222
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:27,747
I couldn’t leave it in the car.

223
00:17:28,623 --> 00:17:29,624
I wasn’t asking.

224
00:17:29,832 --> 00:17:31,042
Let me see it.

225
00:17:34,503 --> 00:17:36,005
Wow, it’s so beautiful.

226
00:17:36,088 --> 00:17:37,256
Miss, do you mind?

227
00:17:39,401 --> 00:17:40,477
I’ll go ahead.

228
00:17:40,676 --> 00:17:42,261
Wait, you can’t.

229
00:17:42,286 --> 00:17:43,361
Wait a minute.

230
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:45,431
Don’t go yet.

231
00:17:46,244 --> 00:17:47,787
Why can’t I go?

232
00:17:48,142 --> 00:17:50,102
There’s a camera right outside.

233
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:56,067
If my boss sees you leaving earlier
than expected, they’ll get mad at me.

234
00:18:07,161 --> 00:18:10,998
If only I knew that we’d be here for
thirty minutes staring at each other

235
00:18:12,500 --> 00:18:17,296
I would have brought my reviewer with me
just so I can use my time right.

236
00:18:17,421 --> 00:18:18,506
You’re studying?

237
00:18:20,174 --> 00:18:23,094
Is it your first time seeing
a studying sex worker?

238
00:18:23,302 --> 00:18:27,348
Not really. I know it’s not rare but
it’s my first time to meet one.

239
00:18:27,382 --> 00:18:28,449
Wow!

240
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,060
Okay, go ahead and use
your phone, I won’t bother you.

241
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:34,271
No phones allowed though.

242
00:18:35,231 --> 00:18:38,317
By the way, why do you have a phone?

243
00:18:38,710 --> 00:18:40,629
So you’re a VIP, huh?

244
00:18:40,778 --> 00:18:42,697
There’s such a rule here?

245
00:18:42,722 --> 00:18:43,806
Yeah.

246
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:48,486
I guess my friend’s a
VIP, it’s my first time here.

247
00:18:50,454 --> 00:18:51,497
Oh the loud guy?

248
00:18:51,497 --> 00:18:52,623
The loud guy.

249
00:18:52,648 --> 00:18:54,733
- Loud guy.
- Oh okay.

250
00:18:57,378 --> 00:19:01,173
Here, use my phone. I’m sure you
have your reviewer in your email.

251
00:19:02,174 --> 00:19:03,509
Yeah, I do.

252
00:19:05,776 --> 00:19:07,403
Are you sure about this?

253
00:19:07,957 --> 00:19:09,376
I’m not gonna decline.

254
00:19:10,630 --> 00:19:12,132
Just don’t tell my boss.

255
00:19:13,187 --> 00:19:15,940
I promise, I won’t. Go ahead and review.

256
00:19:19,501 --> 00:19:24,339
Sorry Hilda, I’m not in the mood
today. Ryan and I fought again earlier.

257
00:19:25,865 --> 00:19:29,285
You know what ‘Tin,
Ryan will always be Ryan.

258
00:19:29,493 --> 00:19:32,496
He’s just a kid, who will never grow up.

259
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,373
Just let him be.

260
00:19:34,957 --> 00:19:37,918
He’ll eventually give up on you.

261
00:19:40,629 --> 00:19:47,261
I don’t want to admit it but the reason
I still own Prima is because of Ryan.

262
00:19:49,096 --> 00:19:52,391
He can easily manipulate
people if he wants to.

263
00:19:53,446 --> 00:19:55,699
And I can lose the company.

264
00:19:57,897 --> 00:20:02,109
This is the only thing I have that I
can call mine, so I can’t let that happen.

265
00:20:03,527 --> 00:20:06,989
This is the only reason
why I’m persevering in life.

266
00:20:07,823 --> 00:20:09,700
Then go for the other option.

267
00:20:10,868 --> 00:20:11,952
Be with him.

268
00:20:13,967 --> 00:20:15,034
What?

269
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:16,957
You’re single.

270
00:20:18,876 --> 00:20:20,586
Don’t you feel lonely?

271
00:20:20,836 --> 00:20:24,173
No one’s waiting for you,
every time you go home.

272
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:28,135
I’m okay.

273
00:20:29,845 --> 00:20:31,347
And why?

274
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:36,352
Oh no, Tin. Is this
post-menopausal syndrome?

275
00:20:40,731 --> 00:20:45,069
I’m fine and content. So don’t worry.

276
00:20:45,778 --> 00:20:50,533
In fact, I'm always excited to go home.

277
00:20:50,950 --> 00:20:54,411
Ooh, I love it! That’s my bestie.

278
00:20:54,578 --> 00:20:55,654
Cheers?

279
00:20:55,663 --> 00:20:57,122
Cheers.

280
00:20:57,147 --> 00:20:58,899
I’m happy for you.

281
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,352
Why?

282
00:21:18,644 --> 00:21:20,187
Nothing, it’s just weird.

283
00:21:22,888 --> 00:21:24,557
You’re weirder.

284
00:21:24,974 --> 00:21:27,560
You brought an engagement
ring to this kind of place.

285
00:21:27,685 --> 00:21:31,188
I didn’t know that my
friend was bringing us here.

286
00:21:31,915 --> 00:21:33,124
Was that a major subject?

287
00:21:33,149 --> 00:21:34,608
Glad you were able to focus.

288
00:21:35,813 --> 00:21:39,858
I need to be flexible if I
want change in my life.

289
00:21:41,907 --> 00:21:46,454
Besides, I have a dream,
even if I’m just a sex worker.

290
00:21:46,704 --> 00:21:48,789
And I admire you for that.

291
00:21:49,290 --> 00:21:50,875
May I know your name?

292
00:21:53,043 --> 00:21:55,212
Oops. Time’s up.

293
00:21:57,548 --> 00:21:59,133
See you next time.

294
00:22:00,176 --> 00:22:04,930
There is no next time, you don’t belong
to these kinds of places.

295
00:22:39,451 --> 00:22:42,788
Good evening, ma’am. Have you eaten?

296
00:22:43,690 --> 00:22:44,899
Later.

297
00:22:45,638 --> 00:22:47,598
Were you able to light Lara’s altar?

298
00:22:47,598 --> 00:22:48,891
Yes, ma’am.

299
00:23:30,933 --> 00:23:33,978
Sorry, dear. Mama came home late today.

300
00:23:50,035 --> 00:23:51,453
Good night, my dear.

301
00:24:44,340 --> 00:24:46,050
I’ve been waiting for you.

302
00:24:47,217 --> 00:24:48,385
Really?

303
00:24:50,346 --> 00:24:53,682
By the way, thank you
for the plant you gave me.

304
00:24:55,017 --> 00:24:56,310
Let’s shower together?

305
00:24:57,811 --> 00:24:58,812
Sure.

306
00:26:02,459 --> 00:26:04,253
That’s so sweet.

307
00:26:04,795 --> 00:26:06,755
He really just let you study?

308
00:26:07,423 --> 00:26:09,758
I said it already, yes.
Jeez, let’s just talk later.

309
00:26:09,758 --> 00:26:11,172
Oh come on.

310
00:26:11,468 --> 00:26:15,264
You said that you can still concentrate
even if we’re talking here.

311
00:26:15,556 --> 00:26:17,975
What’s up? You’re into him?

312
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:18,667
She’s into him?

313
00:26:19,101 --> 00:26:19,810
She said he was handsome.

314
00:26:19,810 --> 00:26:20,936
- He was handsome. Really handsome.
- He was handsome.

315
00:26:21,217 --> 00:26:22,177
Hey!

316
00:26:22,328 --> 00:26:25,289
I don’t really wanna burst your bubble–

317
00:26:25,746 --> 00:26:27,623
But he’s in a relationship.

318
00:26:28,610 --> 00:26:30,738
He even brought an engagement ring.

319
00:26:30,763 --> 00:26:31,822
Too bad.

320
00:26:31,947 --> 00:26:34,533
You know that we don’t belong
to those types of guys, Marie.

321
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:35,718
I know.

322
00:26:35,883 --> 00:26:38,719
But it’s not bad to add
that to your dreams, right?

323
00:26:39,514 --> 00:26:42,142
I just want you to be
happy with a boyfriend.

324
00:26:42,802 --> 00:26:45,263
Someone you’ll love and would love you.

325
00:26:45,614 --> 00:26:47,699
Someone she would kiss for the first time.

326
00:26:48,005 --> 00:26:50,591
Where do you think I can
find someone like that?

327
00:26:51,175 --> 00:26:55,679
And who do you think
will love girls like us?

328
00:26:58,073 --> 00:27:00,242
- Everyone get ready, you’re next.
- We’re sorry.

329
00:27:00,267 --> 00:27:01,935
Jasmine, you’re up again.

330
00:27:03,562 --> 00:27:04,480
I’ll go ahead.

331
00:27:04,480 --> 00:27:04,980
Good luck.

332
00:27:04,980 --> 00:27:05,856
You can do it.

333
00:27:57,972 --> 00:27:59,391
I love you so much.

334
00:27:59,946 --> 00:28:01,364
I love you, too.

335
00:28:03,123 --> 00:28:06,210
Love, starting this
Friday, I’ll be on leave.

336
00:28:06,915 --> 00:28:09,292
I’ll be going to a resort
with Anton and Ericka.

337
00:28:09,317 --> 00:28:11,110
We’ll be gone for about one week.

338
00:28:12,999 --> 00:28:15,168
So, you’ll be gone for a while.

339
00:28:16,565 --> 00:28:18,817
I’ll be sad for a week.

340
00:28:19,876 --> 00:28:22,920
That’s the thing, I
have a surprise for you.

341
00:28:24,040 --> 00:28:26,125
I booked a separate room for us.

342
00:28:26,542 --> 00:28:28,252
I want you to join us, love.

343
00:28:31,380 --> 00:28:32,923
I want to, Tom.

344
00:28:34,444 --> 00:28:35,779
I really do.

345
00:28:37,386 --> 00:28:41,766
But you know that we can’t, right?

346
00:28:44,560 --> 00:28:45,578
If that’s the case —

347
00:28:47,197 --> 00:28:51,243
Maybe it’s time we bring this relationship
to the next level.

348
00:28:53,486 --> 00:28:59,075
So that we’ll no longer have to be
scared of what others have to say about us.

349
00:29:00,201 --> 00:29:04,330
And we won’t need to be scared that
we might be forced to break up anytime.

350
00:29:08,571 --> 00:29:09,780
Stay here, wait a minute.

351
00:29:14,777 --> 00:29:15,853
What’s that?

352
00:29:21,740 --> 00:29:22,832
Love.

353
00:29:39,615 --> 00:29:44,453
I know that we can’t let others
know about our relationship.

354
00:29:45,329 --> 00:29:47,998
So, I’m okay if we’ll have
our wedding in secret.

355
00:29:48,958 --> 00:29:51,085
Even if we won’t have a ceremony.

356
00:29:51,164 --> 00:29:52,328
Even if it’s just simple

357
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:55,798
Or we just register in front of a judge.

358
00:29:56,132 --> 00:29:57,383
That’s fine with me.

359
00:29:58,735 --> 00:30:00,821
I just want you to be my wife.

360
00:30:01,928 --> 00:30:04,889
I want to spend the rest of
my life waking up with you.

361
00:30:05,691 --> 00:30:06,734
I love you.

362
00:30:13,566 --> 00:30:14,650
Tom.

363
00:30:17,820 --> 00:30:19,029
I’m sorry.

364
00:30:20,865 --> 00:30:21,866
But —

365
00:30:23,993 --> 00:30:25,870
I just can’t understand this.

366
00:30:26,162 --> 00:30:27,717
What? Is it still going to be a
problem when we’re married

367
00:30:27,765 --> 00:30:29,726
if you’re my boss and I’m just an employee?

368
00:30:30,708 --> 00:30:32,877
What else can your stepson do by then?

369
00:30:33,546 --> 00:30:35,714
He’s not the only issue, Tom.

370
00:30:36,380 --> 00:30:38,924
It’s just that this situation
is very complicated.

371
00:30:39,091 --> 00:30:41,427
Then, how long are we going to hide?

372
00:30:42,182 --> 00:30:44,351
Are you just gonna keep me a secret?

373
00:30:45,347 --> 00:30:47,224
They can use you.

374
00:30:49,493 --> 00:30:51,662
I don’t want you to get hurt.

375
00:30:52,109 --> 00:30:56,446
You’re younger than me. You’re
my employee. I’m your boss.

376
00:30:57,453 --> 00:31:00,212
What if they call you a gold digger?

377
00:31:00,237 --> 00:31:02,573
- Then I’ll just resign…
- Or that you’re using —

378
00:31:02,781 --> 00:31:04,992
I’ll look for a different job.

379
00:31:06,269 --> 00:31:08,938
I was ready for the worst
when I started loving you.

380
00:31:09,997 --> 00:31:14,293
I’m ready to face what other
people would say about us.

381
00:31:15,051 --> 00:31:16,110
How about you?

382
00:31:17,338 --> 00:31:19,006
Are you going to fight for me?

383
00:31:23,385 --> 00:31:25,137
Maybe you’re just really ashamed of me?

384
00:31:25,137 --> 00:31:27,915
- Since I haven’t proven anything yet?
- I am not ashamed of you, Tom.

385
00:31:30,741 --> 00:31:33,661
I just don’t want you to get
caught up in my problems.

386
00:31:36,085 --> 00:31:38,421
I know you wouldn’t understand but–

387
00:31:38,702 --> 00:31:40,120
I love you, Tom.

388
00:31:41,134 --> 00:31:44,679
I really love you, please
believe me. I love you.

389
00:31:48,157 --> 00:31:51,661
Don’t underestimate me
because I'm just younger.

390
00:31:52,257 --> 00:31:55,761
You just need to tell me what’s going on,
I would understand.

391
00:33:06,363 --> 00:33:11,120
Dear love, this ring shows how serious
I am with our relationship.

392
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,728
But I understand where you’re coming from.

393
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,831
I know it’s a hard
decision for you to make.

394
00:33:23,005 --> 00:33:24,923
A lot of people depend on you.

395
00:33:24,923 --> 00:33:25,758
Were you caught in traffic?

396
00:33:25,758 --> 00:33:27,051
Not just me.

397
00:33:27,295 --> 00:33:29,088
Oh not really, it was just –

398
00:33:29,260 --> 00:33:31,179
There was an accident on the highway.

399
00:33:33,932 --> 00:33:35,559
So, where are we staying?

400
00:33:35,601 --> 00:33:37,019
- Over there?
- Let me just check, sir.

401
00:33:38,205 --> 00:33:39,785
How was your commute?

402
00:33:40,197 --> 00:33:43,784
It’s a good thing I have a VIP client
that allowed us to go on this trip.

403
00:33:44,318 --> 00:33:46,590
Let’s celebrate your
graduation at the same time.

404
00:33:47,363 --> 00:33:49,615
This is going to be fun,
right? Happy graduation!

405
00:33:50,908 --> 00:33:55,120
When I come back... I really hope and pray
to see the ring on your finger.

406
00:33:56,664 --> 00:33:57,998
If not,

407
00:33:58,745 --> 00:33:59,746
it’s okay.

408
00:34:00,586 --> 00:34:02,087
I will understand.

409
00:34:03,092 --> 00:34:05,187
It would have been better
if I had someone with me.

410
00:34:05,881 --> 00:34:08,008
What about us? Aren’t we
with you? Don’t we count?

411
00:34:08,300 --> 00:34:09,468
I don’t think you guys count.

412
00:34:10,788 --> 00:34:12,540
I love you so much, Christine.

413
00:34:13,641 --> 00:34:16,827
I will continue loving you,
whatever your decision will be.

414
00:34:17,935 --> 00:34:20,229
Love, Tom.

415
00:34:29,172 --> 00:34:32,259
Wow! Oh my god, sis!

416
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,660
Is this really happening?

417
00:34:39,456 --> 00:34:42,042
Wait, you rejected him?

418
00:34:42,835 --> 00:34:43,961
Sis?

419
00:34:44,211 --> 00:34:46,547
I don’t want to add to his problems.

420
00:34:46,755 --> 00:34:49,633
But what if he’s willing to support you?

421
00:34:51,462 --> 00:34:52,880
I don’t want to risk it.

422
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:58,017
I’m sure Ryan and Stella
would just use him against me.

423
00:34:58,434 --> 00:35:00,686
I might even lose him.

424
00:35:01,520 --> 00:35:03,981
And this company if that happens.

425
00:35:05,524 --> 00:35:07,609
Especially since he’s just an employee.

426
00:35:08,527 --> 00:35:10,028
He can’t fight back.

427
00:35:12,823 --> 00:35:15,492
So I don’t want to add
to his problems anymore.

428
00:35:19,430 --> 00:35:20,447
Sis.

429
00:35:21,498 --> 00:35:23,459
Is that really your reason?

430
00:35:25,627 --> 00:35:29,131
How long would you stay
a prisoner of your past?

431
00:35:29,757 --> 00:35:35,137
This is it. This is your chance to
finally prioritize yourself.

432
00:35:35,554 --> 00:35:38,640
This is your chance to be happy.

433
00:35:40,976 --> 00:35:42,519
Do you actually love him?

434
00:35:45,105 --> 00:35:46,440
I really do.

435
00:35:46,523 --> 00:35:48,025
I really love her.

436
00:35:48,150 --> 00:35:49,276
Really?

437
00:35:49,902 --> 00:35:51,278
Then why isn’t she here?

438
00:35:51,445 --> 00:35:52,863
Why isn’t she with us today?

439
00:35:53,322 --> 00:35:55,157
I just told you, it’s complicated.

440
00:35:55,532 --> 00:35:59,369
I mean, she has a lot
on her plate. She’s busy.

441
00:35:59,536 --> 00:36:00,617
Dude,

442
00:36:01,025 --> 00:36:03,495
even the members of the royal family

443
00:36:03,495 --> 00:36:07,425
have given up their rights and titles
just to be with the ones they love.

444
00:36:08,003 --> 00:36:11,215
While your girlfriend is just a
simple citizen of the Philippines.

445
00:36:12,091 --> 00:36:16,011
Well, we can’t really
compare other people’s lives.

446
00:36:16,595 --> 00:36:18,388
My point is–

447
00:36:20,224 --> 00:36:24,019
If she loves you, she
wouldn’t keep you a secret.

448
00:36:25,723 --> 00:36:26,740
Right, babe?

449
00:36:27,064 --> 00:36:28,690
Hmm. Hm-mmm.

450
00:36:29,393 --> 00:36:31,520
Especially if she’s proud of you.

451
00:36:32,556 --> 00:36:38,312
Whatever the explanation, a secret
relationship just doesn’t make sense.

452
00:36:39,576 --> 00:36:42,204
Unless both of you agree to it.

453
00:36:43,038 --> 00:36:44,706
Did you two agree to it?

454
00:36:46,208 --> 00:36:49,628
Quit it, you two. I just need
to focus on why I came here.

455
00:36:49,753 --> 00:36:50,796
Which is–

456
00:36:51,678 --> 00:36:54,819
To look for a relationship that
doesn’t need to be kept secret.

457
00:37:00,229 --> 00:37:01,314
Right?

458
00:37:02,426 --> 00:37:07,056
So now that we were caught by the
client’s wife, what are we gonna do now?

459
00:37:07,081 --> 00:37:08,148
Nothing.

460
00:37:08,361 --> 00:37:10,238
The boss told us to stay where we are.

461
00:37:11,204 --> 00:37:13,189
He didn’t even ask for a refund,

462
00:37:13,214 --> 00:37:15,567
maybe he’s too scared that
it might be traced by his wife.

463
00:37:28,667 --> 00:37:30,711
You remembered your mom, huh?

464
00:37:30,815 --> 00:37:31,907
Huh?

465
00:37:31,962 --> 00:37:33,130
Not really.

466
00:37:33,130 --> 00:37:35,424
They were just noisy so they caught my eye.

467
00:37:36,466 --> 00:37:38,635
I know you, besides,
they weren’t that loud.

468
00:37:38,660 --> 00:37:39,994
That look you have.

469
00:37:40,639 --> 00:37:42,282
You’re still looking for her, aren’t you?

470
00:37:43,370 --> 00:37:45,956
How about you? Are you
still looking for your mom?

471
00:37:46,210 --> 00:37:48,337
You know that person
doesn’t really care about me.

472
00:37:51,713 --> 00:37:53,924
That’s why you were given to Miss Annie.

473
00:37:55,753 --> 00:37:57,297
But I do kinda miss it.

474
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:01,116
When she still took care of me
before she became an addict.

475
00:38:02,420 --> 00:38:06,872
I miss how it feels to be loved
without asking for anything in return.

476
00:38:08,649 --> 00:38:11,861
It must be nice to have a
family that loves you, huh?

477
00:38:12,713 --> 00:38:15,132
A mother that takes care of you.

478
00:38:20,331 --> 00:38:23,959
Maybe I had one, I just can’t remember.

479
00:38:26,417 --> 00:38:30,087
Jeez. Let’s just stop
feeling sorry for ourselves.

480
00:38:30,614 --> 00:38:33,033
We should be having fun here.

481
00:38:33,715 --> 00:38:35,467
What's happening to us?

482
00:38:36,068 --> 00:38:38,779
Wait, I’ll just get something
from our room, I’ll be back.

483
00:38:40,675 --> 00:38:42,218
Miss!

484
00:39:31,977 --> 00:39:35,043
Hey, Sis. Look at this girl.

485
00:39:35,168 --> 00:39:37,838
She’s not only pretty
but hard-working too.

486
00:39:37,863 --> 00:39:40,198
A lot have been asking
if she’s actually a model.

487
00:39:40,334 --> 00:39:42,544
You’re right. She is pretty.

488
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:44,383
How did I become a prostitute?

489
00:39:44,445 --> 00:39:45,905
I can’t remember anymore.

490
00:39:45,930 --> 00:39:49,725
The only thing I remember is my grandmother
who died because of an accident.

491
00:39:52,438 --> 00:39:54,148
It’s complicated.

492
00:39:54,468 --> 00:39:57,596
That doesn’t change the
fact that we love each other.

493
00:39:58,001 --> 00:40:01,963
If you love your girlfriend,
then why are you here with me?

494
00:40:02,276 --> 00:40:03,527
Because I like you.

495
00:40:10,091 --> 00:40:11,092
Hello, Sephy.

496
00:40:11,193 --> 00:40:13,820
Do you remember that
girl that went viral?

497
00:40:15,729 --> 00:40:18,941
Shit. Prima sent me an email.

498
00:40:18,966 --> 00:40:19,880
- Prima?
- Yes.

499
00:40:19,880 --> 00:40:22,090
- You mean Prima–
- They saw my video that went viral.
