1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,256
If you’re looking for Christine,

2
00:00:06,474 --> 00:00:07,934
she’s in room 402.

3
00:00:08,382 --> 00:00:10,884
And I think she’s having fun with someone.

4
00:00:11,636 --> 00:00:12,762
If you know what I mean.

5
00:00:13,491 --> 00:00:14,977
I really love you.

6
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:16,241
Fuck you!

7
00:00:16,266 --> 00:00:17,296
Tom.

8
00:00:19,233 --> 00:00:20,386
Fuck you!

9
00:00:20,729 --> 00:00:21,813
Let me explain.

10
00:00:21,968 --> 00:00:23,832
He’s your fucking stepson!

11
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:25,835
No, I’m so sorry.

12
00:00:26,651 --> 00:00:29,028
We may have started off badly, but

13
00:00:29,053 --> 00:00:31,472
I know that what I feel for you is right.

14
00:00:32,657 --> 00:00:34,159
The tickets for tomorrow's concert.

15
00:00:34,159 --> 00:00:36,202
As well as the dinner reservation
I have with Jasmine.

16
00:00:36,202 --> 00:00:37,579
- Okay, sir.
- Thank you.

17
00:00:37,604 --> 00:00:38,680
- Come on?
- Let’s go!

18
00:00:38,705 --> 00:00:41,040
Tell me where my daughter is.

19
00:00:41,065 --> 00:00:42,183
You wait.

20
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,587
Unless you want to meet her in hell.
You might as well bring Tom, too.

21
00:00:47,413 --> 00:00:48,459
No!

22
00:00:51,483 --> 00:00:53,340
I saw this in Ryan’s stuff.

23
00:00:53,365 --> 00:00:55,280
That’s your private
investigator’s notebook.

24
00:00:55,305 --> 00:00:57,766
He’s the one who told me that
Jasmine is your daughter.

25
00:01:01,853 --> 00:01:02,979
Jasmine.

26
00:02:17,512 --> 00:02:18,571
Jasmine,

27
00:02:21,862 --> 00:02:23,831
I have something to tell you.

28
00:02:27,612 --> 00:02:29,197
I hope you can accept.

29
00:02:32,044 --> 00:02:33,587
I’m sorry, please wait a minute.

30
00:02:40,743 --> 00:02:42,036
Hello, Marie.

31
00:02:42,987 --> 00:02:46,034
Jasmine, there are posts going viral
on social media.

32
00:02:46,541 --> 00:02:48,167
Huh? What is it?

33
00:02:48,449 --> 00:02:50,260
I’ll send it to you, check it out.

34
00:02:50,504 --> 00:02:51,556
All right.

35
00:02:51,581 --> 00:02:53,041
Why, what happened?

36
00:03:11,453 --> 00:03:13,526
I’m so sorry, Miss Christine.

37
00:03:13,582 --> 00:03:14,767
Jasmine.

38
00:03:16,102 --> 00:03:17,366
Jasmine?

39
00:03:21,999 --> 00:03:23,349
Hello, Sephy?

40
00:03:23,374 --> 00:03:24,429
Hello.

41
00:03:24,454 --> 00:03:27,999
Sephy, send me Jasmine’s address, please.

42
00:03:28,234 --> 00:03:30,044
Sure Sis, I’ll send it to you.

43
00:03:30,179 --> 00:03:32,007
I hope you two can talk it out.

44
00:03:33,101 --> 00:03:36,814
I hope so, too.
Especially now that she needs me.

45
00:03:37,592 --> 00:03:39,677
I’ll just see you later, okay?

46
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:42,180
I just need to finish something.

47
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:45,099
Thanks, Sephy.

48
00:03:46,851 --> 00:03:49,062
No, Sis. Thank you.

49
00:03:49,687 --> 00:03:51,314
Thank you for giving me the courage.

50
00:03:53,765 --> 00:03:54,897
Okay, bye.

51
00:04:03,534 --> 00:04:05,161
I really need to face this.

52
00:04:06,824 --> 00:04:10,578
No matter what happens,
I’ll be proud of myself.

53
00:04:57,547 --> 00:04:59,716
I’m sorry, I just went straight inside.

54
00:05:02,093 --> 00:05:03,386
Where’s Jasmine?

55
00:05:04,572 --> 00:05:06,023
I thought she’s with you?

56
00:05:06,289 --> 00:05:07,731
She hasn’t arrived yet.

57
00:05:08,258 --> 00:05:09,812
I can’t contact her, either.

58
00:05:12,006 --> 00:05:15,600
Marie, I have something to tell you.

59
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,228
I love you.

60
00:05:54,353 --> 00:05:55,730
I love you, too.

61
00:06:14,415 --> 00:06:15,750
Oh my god.

62
00:06:16,759 --> 00:06:17,770
Why?

63
00:06:35,937 --> 00:06:36,979
Yeah, I just saw it.

64
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:39,107
Wait, let me call Jasmine.

65
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:47,490
The number you dialed is not in service.

66
00:06:51,976 --> 00:06:54,497
The number you dialed is not in service.

67
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:56,667
What’s wrong, son? Is there a problem?

68
00:06:56,791 --> 00:06:58,835
I have to go, Ma. There’s an emergency.

69
00:06:59,350 --> 00:07:01,686
All right, take care.

70
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,467
Here’s our picture from
when we were in elementary.

71
00:07:07,056 --> 00:07:10,225
And here’s the one from
when we were in high school.

72
00:07:11,319 --> 00:07:15,031
Here are all the pictures of Jasmine
when she was growing up.

73
00:07:16,214 --> 00:07:18,591
I saved it all.

74
00:07:18,896 --> 00:07:23,109
I thought that someday when we pass away,

75
00:07:23,317 --> 00:07:25,987
at least someone would
remember that we existed.

76
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:29,382
Someone would recognize our faces.

77
00:07:29,626 --> 00:07:31,795
We don’t have any parents to do it for us.

78
00:07:32,827 --> 00:07:36,205
But Jasmine and I didn't lose hope.

79
00:07:36,442 --> 00:07:41,572
Maybe someday, someone would
come back that would change our life–

80
00:07:43,433 --> 00:07:45,233
and help rid us from this hell.

81
00:07:46,425 --> 00:07:48,094
But no one came yet.

82
00:07:51,686 --> 00:07:53,530
Jasmine admires you a lot.

83
00:07:54,182 --> 00:07:56,429
That’s why she tried
so hard to finish school.

84
00:07:56,601 --> 00:08:00,313
So that she’ll have a better life
similar to how your life turned better.

85
00:08:02,356 --> 00:08:04,062
Has she told stories about me?

86
00:08:04,087 --> 00:08:05,711
Has she been looking for me?

87
00:08:07,028 --> 00:08:10,281
We’ve been going to this place.

88
00:08:10,642 --> 00:08:13,161
It was where her grandmother
had an accident, I think?

89
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:14,676
That’s all I know.

90
00:08:27,177 --> 00:08:30,239
Ma’am, what are we going to do
with Jasmine’s issue?

91
00:08:33,515 --> 00:08:36,310
Anton, I want you to come up
with a press release.

92
00:08:36,576 --> 00:08:40,953
Announcing that we’re removing Jasmine
in our Prima Perfume line.

93
00:08:40,978 --> 00:08:44,774
And we are doing a thorough
investigation on the said exposé, okay?

94
00:08:45,316 --> 00:08:48,694
As for you Tom, you’ll
review the press release

95
00:08:48,694 --> 00:08:53,013
because I don’t want people to think that
we’re condemning Jasmine.

96
00:08:54,742 --> 00:08:56,494
And by the way, if you have time

97
00:08:57,245 --> 00:08:59,789
and you see her, ask her
how she’s doing for me, okay?

98
00:08:59,956 --> 00:09:02,041
Tell her if she needs
anything, I’m here to help.

99
00:09:02,865 --> 00:09:05,242
Ma’am, do you have any idea
who released those photos?

100
00:09:08,127 --> 00:09:09,809
You know my son, right?

101
00:09:10,486 --> 00:09:11,613
He plays dirty.

102
00:09:12,564 --> 00:09:18,153
That’s why I’m doing my best to prevent him
from becoming like his bastard father.

103
00:09:19,159 --> 00:09:22,496
That is why I’m hoping
you can help me with that.

104
00:09:30,861 --> 00:09:37,118
Okay, if Jasmine contacts you or
you see any sign of her, call me.

105
00:09:37,660 --> 00:09:41,038
And girl, if you’ve already
saved up, just leave.

106
00:09:41,770 --> 00:09:43,105
Do it for your child.

107
00:09:43,499 --> 00:09:46,294
The kid’s grown up, he might start
asking about your job.

108
00:09:49,046 --> 00:09:53,467
Okay, call me if Jasmine contacted you.

109
00:09:53,639 --> 00:09:54,650
All right? Okay, bye.

110
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:05,022
Are you judging us because of what we wear?

111
00:10:07,867 --> 00:10:10,257
Because of our jobs?

112
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:13,364
That’s not enough for you to judge us.

113
00:10:15,406 --> 00:10:16,921
I feel offended.

114
00:10:19,535 --> 00:10:23,233
Sorry, I didn’t mean to offend you.

115
00:10:26,302 --> 00:10:29,248
I was just thinking about the hardships
both of you have gone through.

116
00:10:59,254 --> 00:11:00,491
- Hello.
- Hello?

117
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,952
- Hello, Marie?
- Hello, Jasmine.

118
00:11:02,370 --> 00:11:04,997
Do you remember where Grandma Fely
got into an accident?

119
00:11:05,022 --> 00:11:06,374
Yeah, I remember.

120
00:11:06,374 --> 00:11:09,168
Pick me up here please? I’m so tired.

121
00:11:09,794 --> 00:11:11,200
All right then.

122
00:11:19,438 --> 00:11:22,983
Weren’t you informed that Christine
is no longer the CEO of Prima?

123
00:11:24,187 --> 00:11:25,383
May I sit?

124
00:11:27,555 --> 00:11:28,627
Sure.

125
00:11:38,280 --> 00:11:39,657
I’m here for you.

126
00:11:42,675 --> 00:11:44,927
Are you aware of what
your son has been doing?

127
00:11:52,159 --> 00:11:53,184
Yes.

128
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:58,714
And are you also aware that
he’s been killing people?

129
00:12:05,281 --> 00:12:06,373
Yes.

130
00:12:06,764 --> 00:12:08,972
Then, why aren’t you doing anything?

131
00:12:11,591 --> 00:12:13,218
Are you okay with that?

132
00:12:15,316 --> 00:12:17,193
You have to stop your son.

133
00:12:18,526 --> 00:12:20,778
You have to have him arrested.

134
00:12:28,539 --> 00:12:30,458
How can a mother do that to her son?

135
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,720
I can’t afford to ruin my son’s life.

136
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,017
Ryan needs some serious help, Stella.

137
00:12:51,145 --> 00:12:52,730
If you can’t do it–

138
00:12:55,136 --> 00:12:56,145
who will?

139
00:12:59,278 --> 00:13:01,280
Who else has to die–

140
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:05,034
before you take action?

141
00:13:35,688 --> 00:13:38,414
You all just know the name “Jasmine,”
but none of you know,

142
00:13:38,610 --> 00:13:42,227
anything about her life so you
have no right to speak badly of her.

143
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:45,287
Because none of you have any idea
how she ended up in such a life.

144
00:13:46,947 --> 00:13:49,094
She was sold by the person who adopted her,

145
00:13:49,119 --> 00:13:53,064
she worked hard to
have a better life now so–

146
00:13:53,237 --> 00:13:54,947
so shouldn’t we admire her for that?

147
00:13:59,494 --> 00:14:05,041
She didn’t stay a victim, she persevered to
achieve a better life, she fought back.

148
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,376
Don’t trap her in the past.

149
00:14:07,836 --> 00:14:11,623
She’s been through enough.
Let her be happy now.

150
00:14:12,227 --> 00:14:15,191
What happens now will dictate the future.

151
00:14:15,611 --> 00:14:17,363
Take me with you.

152
00:14:17,388 --> 00:14:19,891
Mama just really needs to do this.

153
00:14:19,916 --> 00:14:24,595
It is the duty of the parents to ensure
that their child has a good future.

154
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:29,952
And a mother wants nothing
but the best for her child.

155
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:31,954
Take care of yourself.

156
00:14:33,080 --> 00:14:34,123
Christine!

157
00:14:46,343 --> 00:14:47,845
Take care of it, okay?

158
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:06,488
- Ryan, listen to me.
- What?

159
00:15:06,567 --> 00:15:08,086
Listen to me.

160
00:15:08,991 --> 00:15:11,910
Ryan, I miss my son.

161
00:15:12,828 --> 00:15:14,747
You killed your son, Mom.

162
00:15:15,956 --> 00:15:17,291
You killed your son!

163
00:15:17,790 --> 00:15:18,915
Ryan.

164
00:15:19,126 --> 00:15:20,210
- Ryan!
- Can you not?

165
00:15:20,377 --> 00:15:22,463
Ryan, I’m sorry. I’m sorry.

166
00:15:22,463 --> 00:15:24,840
I didn’t know this would happen to you.

167
00:15:25,493 --> 00:15:30,387
I know I’ve hurt you. I pushed
you to the edge, I’m sorry.

168
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:36,208
I know you’re in there, Ryan.

169
00:15:36,930 --> 00:15:38,932
My charming little son.

170
00:15:40,946 --> 00:15:42,566
And you know what?

171
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:48,173
You don’t have to be alone in this,
we’re in this together.

172
00:15:48,198 --> 00:15:48,922
Are we?

173
00:15:48,947 --> 00:15:51,867
I’ll never leave you alone,
I promise Mommy’s here.

174
00:15:51,892 --> 00:15:53,657
Mommy’s here, okay?

175
00:15:53,768 --> 00:15:55,165
Mr. Ryan Soriano.

176
00:15:55,367 --> 00:15:57,367
- We are arresting you for murder.
- What’s this?

177
00:15:57,891 --> 00:15:59,214
Do you have a warrant?

178
00:15:59,583 --> 00:16:01,168
Mom, I didn’t do anything wrong.

179
00:16:01,314 --> 00:16:04,055
- Mom, I’m not guilty.
- Ryan, Ryan!

180
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,181
- Let go of me.
- Ryan!

181
00:16:05,206 --> 00:16:06,256
Ryan!

182
00:16:06,256 --> 00:16:07,758
No matter how difficult.

183
00:16:08,342 --> 00:16:09,927
No matter how hard.

184
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,182
No matter how painful.

185
00:16:12,841 --> 00:16:17,220
A mother can sacrifice for the
sake of her child’s future.

186
00:16:22,488 --> 00:16:23,522
Lara?

187
00:16:28,751 --> 00:16:30,336
Mama’s here.

188
00:16:35,961 --> 00:16:37,448
Why now?

189
00:16:38,613 --> 00:16:40,156
Why did you leave me?

190
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,795
Everything that happened
to you is my fault.

191
00:16:48,674 --> 00:16:52,845
Allow me to make up
for all of my shortcomings.

192
00:16:55,222 --> 00:16:58,642
Easy for you to say
since you had a good life.

193
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,579
You became rich! You had a better life!

194
00:17:01,937 --> 00:17:05,837
You don’t even know
what I did just to survive.

195
00:17:09,236 --> 00:17:12,072
I lived in the streets because
I didn’t have a mother.

196
00:17:12,364 --> 00:17:14,925
I became a prostitute
because I didn’t have a mother.

197
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:18,037
I was deprived of affection
because I didn’t have a mother!

198
00:17:19,856 --> 00:17:24,360
Ever since we got separated,

199
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:28,380
I’ve been broken.

200
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:33,510
Not a night goes by that I don't pray

201
00:17:33,969 --> 00:17:37,806
that this day will come,
to be with you again.

202
00:17:40,017 --> 00:17:42,895
Didn’t you do anything to find me?

203
00:17:44,766 --> 00:17:48,910
I did everything I could.

204
00:17:49,443 --> 00:17:50,931
Believe me.

205
00:17:53,572 --> 00:17:55,324
I’m sorry, Jasmine.

206
00:17:56,116 --> 00:17:57,409
I’m sorry, my child.

207
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,877
I attempted suicide,

208
00:18:08,045 --> 00:18:12,591
hoping that in my next life, there would
be a mother that would take care of me.

209
00:18:15,677 --> 00:18:18,180
I almost gave up too.

210
00:18:20,210 --> 00:18:23,338
I couldn’t bear the
beatings I got from Benito.

211
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,856
I was crying everyday.

212
00:18:30,192 --> 00:18:32,666
I wanted to die

213
00:18:33,237 --> 00:18:35,948
so that all my sufferings will end.

214
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,743
But I remembered–

215
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:43,372
I remembered that I have a child.

216
00:18:46,333 --> 00:18:51,088
I still need to make it up to her,
I need to stay strong.

217
00:18:55,970 --> 00:18:57,038
Lara.

218
00:18:58,392 --> 00:19:02,282
I’ll let you eat everything
you want to eat.

219
00:19:04,078 --> 00:19:07,269
We’ll go anywhere you want to go.

220
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,357
You’re the reason I’m alive, Jasmine.

221
00:19:12,442 --> 00:19:15,391
Can’t we just think about the present?

222
00:19:16,321 --> 00:19:18,448
You, me.

223
00:19:21,456 --> 00:19:23,458
Us. We’re together now.

224
00:19:24,288 --> 00:19:27,666
We'll never be apart, no matter what.

225
00:19:36,008 --> 00:19:37,593
I’m sorry, Jasmine.

226
00:19:40,554 --> 00:19:42,264
I love you so much.

227
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:58,238
Let's leave all the pain, all the anger,
and all the burden in the past.

228
00:20:02,802 --> 00:20:04,429
I’m sorry, Jasmine.

229
00:20:10,751 --> 00:20:15,422
And let's embrace the new chapters that
will come in our lives.

230
00:20:16,131 --> 00:20:19,801
Don’t worry, I’ve already
talked to Mom and Dad.

231
00:20:19,951 --> 00:20:21,011
Are you sure?

232
00:20:21,011 --> 00:20:22,596
Everything’s gonna be okay, okay?

233
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,805
Love will win.

234
00:20:27,216 --> 00:20:28,268
Love you.

235
00:20:28,268 --> 00:20:29,478
I love you, too.

236
00:20:39,905 --> 00:20:41,949
Babe, your shoelace.

237
00:20:42,437 --> 00:20:43,499
Oh yeah.

238
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:48,937
Anton.

239
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:50,136
Yeah?

240
00:20:50,735 --> 00:20:51,792
What?

241
00:20:51,792 --> 00:20:54,169
Hey, what’s that?

242
00:20:54,616 --> 00:20:56,046
You’re so slow.

243
00:20:56,419 --> 00:20:57,639
Take it.

244
00:20:57,664 --> 00:20:59,333
Then ask me to marry you.

245
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:00,926
Don’t you want to?

246
00:21:02,219 --> 00:21:03,219
I do.

247
00:21:03,462 --> 00:21:04,713
Then, do it.

248
00:21:06,438 --> 00:21:09,034
Ericka, will you–

249
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:10,644
No need to ask.

250
00:21:11,193 --> 00:21:12,403
Of course, it’s a yes.

251
00:21:22,239 --> 00:21:24,825
-I believe that as long as we’re alive,
-Shit.

252
00:21:25,036 --> 00:21:26,481
there is still hope.

253
00:21:29,282 --> 00:21:30,283
Hello?

254
00:21:30,308 --> 00:21:33,350
Hello, Ms. Marie Dela Cruz, this is Regine
from Makeup Academy

255
00:21:33,375 --> 00:21:37,004
and we received your application
and after our selection process,

256
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,926
you are chosen as one of our scholars.

257
00:21:39,951 --> 00:21:43,218
Madam, thank you for this great news.

258
00:21:43,243 --> 00:21:45,988
I’ve always wanted to study, thank you.
Thank you so much.

259
00:21:46,013 --> 00:21:47,305
Thank you. Thank you.

260
00:21:52,362 --> 00:21:53,678
Oh my god.

261
00:21:54,002 --> 00:21:58,715
I was so scared to stay single before.

262
00:22:00,067 --> 00:22:02,444
Because it felt like I was so weak.

263
00:22:04,909 --> 00:22:09,199
I felt like I was alone.

264
00:22:11,775 --> 00:22:16,863
But then I realized, I was never alone.

265
00:22:18,996 --> 00:22:21,540
I have my friends and family

266
00:22:23,528 --> 00:22:25,809
who always supported me.

267
00:22:27,637 --> 00:22:32,309
And then now, I have you guys–

268
00:22:34,459 --> 00:22:38,630
I’m with you all through
this spiritual journey.

269
00:22:41,064 --> 00:22:42,315
Pray for me?

270
00:22:43,718 --> 00:22:46,309
We can take back all that was lost.

271
00:22:46,379 --> 00:22:49,279
We can still chase our
dreams from the past.

272
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:53,998
What’s important now is
that you’re no longer alone.

273
00:22:54,520 --> 00:22:57,121
You now have your family by your side.

274
00:22:59,293 --> 00:23:02,297
Mom, you should eat
more, you’re getting skinnier.

275
00:23:02,297 --> 00:23:03,381
Hmmm, it’s okay.

276
00:23:11,181 --> 00:23:18,396
Don’t be afraid to face the truth now.
This would help strengthen us.

277
00:23:25,695 --> 00:23:27,364
Marie told me.

278
00:23:29,157 --> 00:23:30,659
You two should talk.

279
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:42,587
I’m sorry, I didn’t know
what was happening to you.

280
00:23:43,547 --> 00:23:45,006
I should’ve done more for you.

281
00:23:46,174 --> 00:23:48,135
You were a big help.

282
00:23:50,595 --> 00:23:52,889
I’m glad that you’ve finally met your mom.

283
00:23:53,765 --> 00:23:56,059
But I know you need
more time to process this.

284
00:23:57,018 --> 00:23:59,187
If you need anything,
I’m just here for you.

285
00:24:00,234 --> 00:24:01,360
Thank you.

286
00:24:02,862 --> 00:24:05,865
When we’re ready, let’s meet again.

287
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:21,710
This is the right time for us to free
ourselves to be able to face the future.

288
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:23,292
We had fun times.

289
00:24:23,748 --> 00:24:27,544
We had love and I’ll forever treasure that.

290
00:24:43,315 --> 00:24:44,733
I love you so much.

291
00:24:45,385 --> 00:24:46,721
I love you.

292
00:25:06,934 --> 00:25:08,048
I love you.

293
00:25:08,169 --> 00:25:09,424
I love you.

294
00:25:11,610 --> 00:25:13,070
So many things went wrong.

295
00:25:14,724 --> 00:25:17,537
That’s not important, what matters is that,

296
00:25:18,779 --> 00:25:22,241
what we felt then was real, Tom.

297
00:25:23,239 --> 00:25:25,199
And those feelings saved me.

298
00:25:27,204 --> 00:25:30,291
But those feelings have to end.

299
00:25:32,056 --> 00:25:36,602
Feelings change, we have to move forward.

300
00:25:38,495 --> 00:25:42,374
And I want to be a good mother to Jasmine,
that’s all that matters now.

301
00:25:45,397 --> 00:25:46,606
I understand.

302
00:25:48,184 --> 00:25:50,090
She’s lucky to have you as her mother.

303
00:25:58,660 --> 00:26:00,287
Slowly.

304
00:26:03,520 --> 00:26:04,562
Okay, stay here.

305
00:26:05,436 --> 00:26:07,354
I’ll move a bit, wait.

306
00:26:08,441 --> 00:26:09,484
Okay, stay here.

307
00:26:09,776 --> 00:26:11,153
What’s this, Ma?

308
00:26:11,653 --> 00:26:13,238
Wait, here it is.

309
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,872
- Happy birthday!
- Happy birthday!

310
00:26:17,951 --> 00:26:19,552
Thank you, Ma.

311
00:26:19,577 --> 00:26:21,846
- Happy birthday, Jasmine.
- Thank you.

312
00:26:21,871 --> 00:26:24,614
- What’s this, Ma? This is a lot.
- Here you go.

313
00:26:25,041 --> 00:26:29,504
We’ll celebrate all of your
missed birthdays today.

314
00:26:29,707 --> 00:26:31,251
This is a lot, Ma.

315
00:26:33,508 --> 00:26:34,968
This is so much fun.

316
00:26:34,968 --> 00:26:37,095
I never forgot you, Jasmine.

317
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,432
Every time it was your
birthday, I got you presents,

318
00:26:40,432 --> 00:26:41,975
and I kept them all.

319
00:26:42,392 --> 00:26:45,979
Because I knew that we
would see each other again.

320
00:26:46,794 --> 00:26:51,424
I did have one gift that I didn’t
keep and I was able to give to you.

321
00:26:57,532 --> 00:26:59,200
I’ll take care of this, Ma.

322
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:03,621
I’ll take care of this bracelet
because this is special to me.

323
00:27:06,374 --> 00:27:09,169
Who would have thought
that it really was for me?

324
00:27:12,255 --> 00:27:16,301
The first time I saw you, I had a
feeling that you were my daughter.

325
00:27:18,386 --> 00:27:23,850
Destiny brings people
together for a reason.

326
00:27:24,768 --> 00:27:25,894
Happy birthday, dear.

327
00:27:25,894 --> 00:27:27,228
- Thank you, Ma.
- Excuse me.

328
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:29,767
Can we light the candles now?
I’m getting hungry.

329
00:27:30,071 --> 00:27:31,281
- Of course.
- Sure.

330
00:27:31,306 --> 00:27:32,383
Is it okay?

331
00:27:32,408 --> 00:27:33,826
We were being too dramatic.

332
00:27:34,274 --> 00:27:35,681
I’m hungry, sorry.

333
00:27:35,681 --> 00:27:37,517
Okay, let’s do this, light up the candles.

334
00:27:40,033 --> 00:27:41,076
- Hurry, hurry.
- There.

335
00:27:48,178 --> 00:27:50,743
Yay! Happy birthday!

336
00:27:51,044 --> 00:27:52,712
Happy birthday, dear.

337
00:27:52,712 --> 00:27:53,868
Thank you, Ma.

338
00:27:54,214 --> 00:27:56,925
This is my advance birthday gift to you.

339
00:27:57,675 --> 00:27:59,751
A brand new building.

340
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:01,856
Thank you. Thank you, Ma.

341
00:28:01,881 --> 00:28:03,298
I love you.

342
00:28:05,482 --> 00:28:11,029
And you will be the owner of a new brand
that will be known in the beauty industry.

343
00:28:11,768 --> 00:28:15,229
A name that symbolizes
the beauty of each Filipina.

344
00:28:15,891 --> 00:28:17,018
Sampaguita.

345
00:28:17,474 --> 00:28:19,563
This is all yours, Jasmine.

346
00:28:21,490 --> 00:28:25,202
Ma, what do I know about
managing a business?

347
00:28:25,907 --> 00:28:27,390
I’ll teach you.

348
00:28:27,885 --> 00:28:29,762
I built Prima.

349
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:32,009
So I’ll teach you everything I know

350
00:28:32,794 --> 00:28:36,790
so that the Sampaguita
beauty line will be successful.

351
00:28:37,298 --> 00:28:41,970
For the meantime, I’ll enroll you in
advanced courses for management, okay?

352
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:46,141
Aunty, Jasmine, maybe you can–

353
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,478
After my course in Makeup Academy,
is it okay if I can apply in your company?

354
00:28:51,146 --> 00:28:54,353
Come on, you don’t have to apply,
you already have a position.

355
00:28:55,154 --> 00:28:57,571
- I have a position!
- You’ll have a job!

356
00:28:58,528 --> 00:29:00,525
Thank you, Ma.

357
00:29:05,452 --> 00:29:06,995
So how long will you stay there, bro?

358
00:29:07,787 --> 00:29:10,165
Maybe two to three months, I’m not sure.

359
00:29:10,415 --> 00:29:11,833
I just need time to think.

360
00:29:13,349 --> 00:29:16,186
Just don’t stay there for four months.

361
00:29:18,595 --> 00:29:20,216
That would be the month of our wedding.

362
00:29:20,241 --> 00:29:21,359
What?

363
00:29:21,384 --> 00:29:22,927
Have you proposed, Anton?

364
00:29:22,927 --> 00:29:23,970
Show them.

365
00:29:25,805 --> 00:29:28,433
Take note, I proposed to him.

366
00:29:28,458 --> 00:29:29,478
Wow!

367
00:29:30,852 --> 00:29:33,271
Of course, we live in modern times now.

368
00:29:34,126 --> 00:29:36,461
It’s normal for a woman to make the move.

369
00:29:37,066 --> 00:29:38,985
It looked like he didn’t want to marry me.

370
00:29:39,571 --> 00:29:42,882
So I did it, let’s secure the future.

371
00:29:42,907 --> 00:29:44,159
Oh, come on.

372
00:29:44,824 --> 00:29:48,923
I did look for a ring, you just
found one before me. That’s it.

373
00:29:50,246 --> 00:29:52,624
Sure, whatever.

374
00:29:53,642 --> 00:29:55,118
I’m happy for both of you.

375
00:29:55,335 --> 00:29:58,546
Well, at least one of
us got a happy ending.

376
00:30:02,133 --> 00:30:03,718
What, why so quiet?

377
00:30:05,000 --> 00:30:07,059
Don’t worry about me, I’m fine.

378
00:30:07,883 --> 00:30:09,642
I’ll see you guys in three months?

379
00:30:11,499 --> 00:30:12,834
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

380
00:30:13,227 --> 00:30:16,021
Three months, okay? If you go beyond that–

381
00:30:23,341 --> 00:30:25,010
This is a nice shade, Ma.

382
00:30:25,035 --> 00:30:27,742
- We chose the right color.
- Yeah.

383
00:30:28,952 --> 00:30:31,412
Yeah, this looks good on fair skin.

384
00:30:31,579 --> 00:30:32,830
- Right?
- Hm-mmm.

385
00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:34,415
That’s good for contour, Ma.

386
00:30:35,707 --> 00:30:38,118
That would definitely
be a hit in the market.

387
00:30:38,218 --> 00:30:44,849
Charges against former Prima
Beauty executive Ryan Soriano continue.

388
00:30:45,316 --> 00:30:47,596
This was after the families of those who

389
00:30:47,596 --> 00:30:50,115
were allegedly killed
gave their statements.

390
00:30:50,139 --> 00:30:52,601
We can all recall that Soriano
was arrested by the police

391
00:30:52,601 --> 00:30:54,801
after he was charged with murder.

392
00:30:55,524 --> 00:30:57,693
He won’t be able to hurt us anymore.

393
00:31:20,208 --> 00:31:22,502
How’s your group therapy going?

394
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:25,300
It’s okay.

395
00:31:25,899 --> 00:31:27,901
It’s working actually, it’s effective.

396
00:31:28,618 --> 00:31:31,203
Makes me realize how to love myself first.

397
00:31:32,181 --> 00:31:33,349
It makes sense, right?

398
00:31:34,165 --> 00:31:39,231
How can I love someone,
if I lack love for myself?

399
00:31:41,232 --> 00:31:42,567
That’s nice.

400
00:31:43,401 --> 00:31:46,029
Oh why don’t you try?

401
00:31:46,648 --> 00:31:47,983
Try to attend once.

402
00:31:49,032 --> 00:31:51,242
It might help with your past traumas.

403
00:31:52,913 --> 00:31:56,917
I know you’ve been
bottling it up for a long time,

404
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,294
so try it.

405
00:32:00,280 --> 00:32:01,477
Oh she’s here.

406
00:32:01,502 --> 00:32:02,538
- Hi.
- Hi.

407
00:32:02,563 --> 00:32:04,191
Christine, sit beside me.

408
00:32:04,216 --> 00:32:05,355
Thank you.

409
00:32:06,095 --> 00:32:07,763
How are you?

410
00:32:09,590 --> 00:32:11,717
I’m okay, just getting by.

411
00:32:13,431 --> 00:32:15,058
That’s just how it is Stella.

412
00:32:16,355 --> 00:32:20,192
You’re not just a mother to Ryan,
you’re also the mother of Prima.

413
00:32:22,387 --> 00:32:25,890
If there’s one thing that I realized,

414
00:32:26,991 --> 00:32:29,800
you are a tough woman.

415
00:32:32,387 --> 00:32:37,267
I just learnt to be tough after everything
you and your son put me through.

416
00:32:37,292 --> 00:32:40,425
Who wouldn’t be tough, right?

417
00:32:40,820 --> 00:32:44,782
You’re also a tough woman, Stella.

418
00:32:45,783 --> 00:32:48,578
You just made the
toughest decision of your life.

419
00:32:50,394 --> 00:32:51,771
Thank you.

420
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:55,425
We should meet more often.

421
00:32:55,450 --> 00:32:57,118
- Yeah.
- You’re right.

422
00:32:57,298 --> 00:32:59,136
- Next time, let's go to the spa.
- Sure.

423
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,104
I like that.

424
00:33:01,104 --> 00:33:02,855
And after that, you know–

425
00:33:29,298 --> 00:33:32,385
Aunty Fely, I’m with Lara now.

426
00:33:33,136 --> 00:33:36,681
Grandma Fely, my name is Jasmine now.

427
00:33:37,480 --> 00:33:39,274
I’m sure you don’t know me anymore.

428
00:33:40,348 --> 00:33:42,726
See, I’ve gotten prettier.

429
00:33:43,482 --> 00:33:45,442
Of course, you take after me.

430
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:54,115
Aunty Fely, I’ll be forever grateful
to you for taking care of my daughter.

431
00:33:54,949 --> 00:33:56,784
Thank you so much.

432
00:33:58,419 --> 00:34:00,504
Please always guide us.

433
00:34:01,038 --> 00:34:02,540
We love you.

434
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:24,395
You look busy.

435
00:34:25,146 --> 00:34:28,107
Oh, you’re here. Have a seat.

436
00:34:32,695 --> 00:34:34,238
Why are you busy?

437
00:34:37,033 --> 00:34:38,951
Management crash course.

438
00:34:39,327 --> 00:34:43,122
Yeah, I heard. They said
you’ll be launching Sampaguita.

439
00:34:43,320 --> 00:34:44,822
Nice name.

440
00:34:45,072 --> 00:34:46,365
I actually love it.

441
00:34:48,974 --> 00:34:50,809
You look different.

442
00:34:51,595 --> 00:34:53,203
You look so fresh.

443
00:34:54,815 --> 00:34:58,008
I was just able to rest and think.

444
00:34:59,219 --> 00:35:03,758
I realized what’s important to me and
what I think is worth pursuing.

445
00:35:05,681 --> 00:35:07,891
I became a better man for you.

446
00:35:08,850 --> 00:35:10,351
I think, this time–

447
00:35:10,656 --> 00:35:12,903
fate really intended to have us meet again.

448
00:37:47,434 --> 00:37:49,978
I guess it’s true when
they say that time heals.

449
00:37:52,788 --> 00:37:57,709
I thought I would never be
ready for us to meet again.

450
00:37:59,535 --> 00:38:03,527
I regret the days when I
tried to push you away.

451
00:38:06,966 --> 00:38:08,592
It really hurt.

452
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:16,972
You’re right though, you don’t deserve
to be loved half-heartedly.

453
00:38:18,306 --> 00:38:23,011
The pain we felt back then
saved us from future pain.

454
00:38:24,887 --> 00:38:29,642
But I promise you, you’ll never
have to go through that pain alone.

455
00:39:12,516 --> 00:39:13,576
I love you.

456
00:39:13,601 --> 00:39:14,810
I love you, too.

457
00:39:27,073 --> 00:39:31,368
Jasmine and I will have
a fresh start together.

458
00:39:32,661 --> 00:39:39,585
Destiny may have hindered us, but the love
between a mother and daughter

459
00:39:39,585 --> 00:39:44,423
still prevailed even though they were both
robbed of happiness just to be together.

460
00:39:45,716 --> 00:39:49,804
A new beginning, a new chapter.
