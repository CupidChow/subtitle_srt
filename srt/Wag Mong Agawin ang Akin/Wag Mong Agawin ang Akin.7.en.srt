1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,923
<i>I think we should stop this.</i>

2
00:00:07,215 --> 00:00:09,570
<i>I know that Miss
Christine is your girlfriend.</i>

3
00:00:09,804 --> 00:00:11,422
<i>I don’t want to deceive her.</i>

4
00:00:11,469 --> 00:00:14,764
<i>I don't want to make myself believe
that we can be together.</i>

5
00:00:15,663 --> 00:00:17,206
Well, what do you know?

6
00:00:17,231 --> 00:00:19,882
A mother and daughter hooking up
with the same guy.

7
00:00:19,907 --> 00:00:21,304
If only they knew.

8
00:00:30,613 --> 00:00:31,698
What did I do?

9
00:00:31,698 --> 00:00:32,866
What did you do?

10
00:00:32,891 --> 00:00:34,200
This is you, right?

11
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:35,535
Are you tired of me?

12
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,542
That’s why you replaced
me with someone younger?

13
00:00:37,567 --> 00:00:39,195
Are you not happy with me?

14
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,307
I just want you to be my wife.

15
00:00:54,764 --> 00:00:57,053
So you know what’s going
on between me and Tom.

16
00:00:57,078 --> 00:00:58,183
Look me in the eye.

17
00:00:58,208 --> 00:00:59,793
Look me in the eye.

18
00:02:20,843 --> 00:02:22,014
Please stop.

19
00:02:22,929 --> 00:02:25,280
I beg you, I can’t take it anymore.

20
00:02:25,305 --> 00:02:26,521
I can’t take it anymore.

21
00:02:29,315 --> 00:02:30,400
Please stop.

22
00:03:07,687 --> 00:03:08,688
Hello boss, Ryan.

23
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,447
<i>Philippines, still hauling in
gold medal on the last day</i>

24
00:03:17,447 --> 00:03:21,538
<i>of competition at the
Southeast Asian Games—</i>

25
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:28,958
<i>Breaking news – a man was
found dead in a vacant lot.</i>

26
00:03:28,983 --> 00:03:32,838
<i>Based on the gathered IDs
and police information, the man</i>

27
00:03:32,838 --> 00:03:35,687
<i>was identified as Marcus Fidel, </i>

28
00:03:35,733 --> 00:03:40,095
<i>a private investigator.
Authorities are still investigating</i>

29
00:03:40,095 --> 00:03:43,772
<i>the motive and who killed the man.</i>

30
00:03:44,968 --> 00:03:46,184
Oh, my god.

31
00:03:47,520 --> 00:03:48,521
Christine!

32
00:03:48,934 --> 00:03:50,727
Did you kill that man?

33
00:03:51,228 --> 00:03:54,523
I shouldn’t have given
you the photo of that man.

34
00:03:55,067 --> 00:03:57,444
<i>You’re not thinking.</i>

35
00:03:58,396 --> 00:04:00,649
How can I protect you now?

36
00:04:01,994 --> 00:04:03,871
There’s no one to protect, Ma.

37
00:04:04,462 --> 00:04:05,630
Ryan!

38
00:04:06,999 --> 00:04:09,084
Was it you who killed Marcus?

39
00:04:12,381 --> 00:04:13,880
How could you?

40
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,822
Honestly, I thought he was your boyfriend.

41
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:24,709
But it turns out, he’s way more important.

42
00:04:25,619 --> 00:04:27,704
He was looking for your dead daughter.

43
00:04:28,842 --> 00:04:30,344
My daughter is not dead.

44
00:04:30,671 --> 00:04:33,390
Lara is alive, she’s just missing.

45
00:04:33,415 --> 00:04:36,919
Oh, Christine. Lara, Lara, Lara.

46
00:04:37,170 --> 00:04:38,171
Yes!

47
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:43,032
Marcus did say who and where she was.

48
00:04:43,746 --> 00:04:47,166
But don’t worry, she’s not with me.

49
00:04:49,984 --> 00:04:52,821
Where is she? Tell me, Ryan.

50
00:04:57,783 --> 00:04:58,951
Christine.

51
00:05:01,511 --> 00:05:03,805
I have everything you need.

52
00:05:06,099 --> 00:05:08,518
But you still treat me this way?

53
00:05:11,626 --> 00:05:14,712
In fact, I saved all the information.

54
00:05:15,077 --> 00:05:16,537
Just to be fair.

55
00:05:17,979 --> 00:05:18,980
By the way–

56
00:05:20,332 --> 00:05:22,578
This last private
investigator of yours is good,

57
00:05:22,578 --> 00:05:25,478
I didn’t get anything from the others.

58
00:05:26,858 --> 00:05:27,910
You?

59
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:33,041
You were responsible for the disappearance
of my previous investigators?

60
00:05:34,125 --> 00:05:35,918
You’re really evil!

61
00:05:35,918 --> 00:05:37,420
You criminal!

62
00:05:38,933 --> 00:05:43,108
Why won’t you tell me where my daughter is?

63
00:05:43,457 --> 00:05:48,170
‘Cause I don’t want you
having anyone else, but me.

64
00:05:51,043 --> 00:05:53,014
You should be with me.

65
00:05:54,962 --> 00:05:57,632
I’m the only one who loves you this much.

66
00:06:03,914 --> 00:06:08,544
I accept all of you so you don’t need
your daughter or anyone else.

67
00:06:10,453 --> 00:06:12,121
No please, Ryan.

68
00:06:13,161 --> 00:06:15,414
Please tell me where my daughter is.

69
00:06:15,976 --> 00:06:17,478
Don’t hurt her.

70
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:20,893
Don’t get her involved
in this, please Ryan.

71
00:06:22,298 --> 00:06:23,299
Please.

72
00:06:25,501 --> 00:06:27,890
I beg you, Ryan.

73
00:06:33,063 --> 00:06:35,065
You don’t have to keep begging.

74
00:06:37,104 --> 00:06:41,053
I will tell you who and where she is.

75
00:06:42,978 --> 00:06:44,905
Just do everything I want.

76
00:06:46,381 --> 00:06:49,885
Yeah, I’ll do anything.

77
00:06:50,182 --> 00:06:53,269
I’ll do it just tell me, what
do you want me to do?

78
00:06:53,624 --> 00:06:55,234
- Christine.
- Tell me.

79
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,369
You know what I really want.

80
00:06:59,569 --> 00:07:00,724
Right?

81
00:07:01,593 --> 00:07:02,630
You.

82
00:07:03,796 --> 00:07:04,966
You.

83
00:07:07,051 --> 00:07:08,553
I’ve missed you.

84
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,194
I miss you, Christine.

85
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,549
If you’re looking for Christine,

86
00:07:46,809 --> 00:07:48,561
she’s in room 402.

87
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:52,003
And I think she’s having fun with someone.

88
00:07:52,158 --> 00:07:53,660
If you know what I mean.

89
00:07:59,191 --> 00:08:00,651
Ryan, no.

90
00:11:03,474 --> 00:11:04,509
Tom!

91
00:11:26,325 --> 00:11:29,709
I wanna see your face Christine,
I wanna see your face.

92
00:11:33,286 --> 00:11:37,107
Say that you love me Christine,
say that you love me!

93
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:39,791
I love you.

94
00:11:40,060 --> 00:11:41,453
I really love you.

95
00:11:52,102 --> 00:11:53,441
I love you.

96
00:12:06,513 --> 00:12:07,773
I love you.

97
00:12:09,233 --> 00:12:10,485
Fuck you!

98
00:12:10,510 --> 00:12:11,528
Tom!

99
00:12:15,591 --> 00:12:16,855
Fuck you!

100
00:12:18,645 --> 00:12:19,743
Tom.

101
00:12:24,169 --> 00:12:25,369
Tom.

102
00:12:33,244 --> 00:12:34,478
Let me explain.

103
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,297
He’s your fucking stepson!

104
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,590
No, I’m so sorry.

105
00:12:39,125 --> 00:12:41,268
I’m so sorry, Tom.

106
00:12:43,919 --> 00:12:45,379
Let’s get married.

107
00:12:46,098 --> 00:12:49,101
I don’t care about Prima or anything else.

108
00:12:49,266 --> 00:12:51,935
Christine, that won’t
solve any of our problems.

109
00:12:54,035 --> 00:12:56,121
What do you want us to do then?

110
00:12:56,378 --> 00:12:57,872
What do you want?

111
00:12:58,918 --> 00:13:00,905
Christine, I want to be with you.

112
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:04,399
But after all that happened between us,

113
00:13:05,526 --> 00:13:07,429
do we still deserve each other?

114
00:13:08,745 --> 00:13:10,872
Is our relationship still worth saving?

115
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:15,781
What should we do?

116
00:13:16,183 --> 00:13:17,697
Let’s fix this.

117
00:13:18,336 --> 00:13:21,715
Let’s fix this. Please,
Tom, we can still fix this.

118
00:13:22,282 --> 00:13:24,785
This relationship is
bringing out the worst in us.

119
00:13:26,007 --> 00:13:28,634
We can’t even trust each other anymore.

120
00:13:30,517 --> 00:13:33,353
I think we need to face the truth.

121
00:13:33,572 --> 00:13:36,992
No, no, Tom.

122
00:13:38,729 --> 00:13:40,189
No, Tom, please.

123
00:13:40,729 --> 00:13:41,981
Please.

124
00:13:44,253 --> 00:13:45,588
Tom, please.

125
00:13:46,925 --> 00:13:48,150
Tom.

126
00:14:14,835 --> 00:14:15,896
Tom.

127
00:14:22,550 --> 00:14:24,469
I know you’re still hurting.

128
00:14:27,032 --> 00:14:29,702
We may have started off badly,

129
00:14:30,932 --> 00:14:33,810
but I know that what
I feel for you is right.

130
00:14:36,951 --> 00:14:39,120
Tom, I'm willing to be by your side.

131
00:15:33,794 --> 00:15:36,088
What else do you want to know?

132
00:15:36,774 --> 00:15:40,736
I already told you that the
person in that picture is Jasmine.

133
00:15:41,831 --> 00:15:44,084
I sold her to the club before.

134
00:15:49,327 --> 00:15:51,121
No, please, no!

135
00:15:57,371 --> 00:15:58,414
Friend.

136
00:15:59,294 --> 00:16:00,451
Sis.

137
00:16:01,876 --> 00:16:05,755
Tom and Jasmine are the
last of your concerns right now.

138
00:16:07,299 --> 00:16:08,884
What Ryan did,

139
00:16:10,052 --> 00:16:13,764
what he did to you,

140
00:16:14,496 --> 00:16:15,539
is it all true?

141
00:16:16,350 --> 00:16:17,726
Can he really kill someone?

142
00:16:22,321 --> 00:16:24,101
It’s my fault, Sephy.

143
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:27,778
It’s all my fault.

144
00:16:27,803 --> 00:16:28,987
Sis.

145
00:16:30,032 --> 00:16:31,726
You can’t be like this.

146
00:16:31,852 --> 00:16:33,744
I’m gonna call the police.

147
00:16:36,161 --> 00:16:40,080
No, I don’t want to
make a big deal out of it.

148
00:16:40,105 --> 00:16:42,501
But, we can’t just–

149
00:16:42,681 --> 00:16:44,182
Friend, this can’t be.

150
00:16:46,752 --> 00:16:48,313
Let’s just go home.

151
00:16:49,662 --> 00:16:52,206
They’ll pick us up tomorrow.

152
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:57,975
If you want, I’ll just stay
here with you, okay?

153
00:16:57,975 --> 00:16:59,463
I won’t leave you alone.

154
00:17:00,844 --> 00:17:02,186
Do you want anything?

155
00:17:12,281 --> 00:17:15,017
<i>I’ll do everything to see you, Lara.</i>

156
00:17:16,243 --> 00:17:20,205
<i>I just hope that when we
meet, you can accept me.</i>

157
00:17:54,093 --> 00:17:56,137
What now? There’s proof.

158
00:17:56,467 --> 00:17:57,477
Huh?

159
00:17:58,619 --> 00:17:59,870
Show her, hurry.

160
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,491
- What are you talking about?
- Oh boy.

161
00:18:01,747 --> 00:18:04,062
There you go.

162
00:18:04,095 --> 00:18:05,596
Bro, you can’t deny that.

163
00:18:06,881 --> 00:18:09,112
- Let me see it again.
- What do you call each other?

164
00:18:09,421 --> 00:18:11,673
Babe? Honey? Sweetheart?

165
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,885
- Babe.
- Oh.

166
00:18:15,511 --> 00:18:17,596
Seems like you guys
haven’t talked about it yet.

167
00:18:17,621 --> 00:18:18,775
Seems like it.

168
00:18:19,334 --> 00:18:21,837
- Girls, let’s leave them alone for now.
- Let’s go.

169
00:18:22,031 --> 00:18:23,562
- Bro.
- Bye.

170
00:18:35,823 --> 00:18:38,450
Let's stand by what the people are saying.

171
00:18:38,819 --> 00:18:40,069
Let’s be a couple.

172
00:18:40,335 --> 00:18:41,557
Are you sure?

173
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:44,500
Christine and I are no longer together.

174
00:18:44,525 --> 00:18:48,593
And I’m lucky to be with someone
who's proud to be with me.

175
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:51,296
Do you love me?

176
00:18:52,968 --> 00:18:54,135
I love you.

177
00:21:14,106 --> 00:21:15,649
Where’s my daughter?

178
00:21:17,043 --> 00:21:19,556
We’re not even done yet and
you’re already demanding from me?

179
00:21:20,030 --> 00:21:22,699
I’ll tell you about her, after
you’ve done a lot for me.

180
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,247
Tell me where my daughter is.

181
00:21:30,272 --> 00:21:31,418
What the hell, Christine?

182
00:21:32,233 --> 00:21:33,651
I gave you a chance.

183
00:21:35,041 --> 00:21:39,128
Why can’t you just accept the fact
that I’m the one who truly loves you?

184
00:21:40,772 --> 00:21:44,234
And don’t you dare
blame me for your stupidity.

185
00:21:44,698 --> 00:21:47,868
This all wouldn’t have happened
if you chose to be with me from the start.

186
00:21:48,697 --> 00:21:49,948
You wait.

187
00:21:51,004 --> 00:21:54,549
Unless you want to meet her in hell.
You might as well bring Tom, too.

188
00:22:02,534 --> 00:22:04,356
So you guys are officially a couple?

189
00:22:06,481 --> 00:22:09,233
Wow, congratulations!

190
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:12,464
But why do you look grumpy?
Aren’t you supposed to be happy?

191
00:22:14,833 --> 00:22:17,085
Tom and I are officially together but–

192
00:22:17,957 --> 00:22:19,173
it doesn’t feel right.

193
00:22:19,343 --> 00:22:22,888
Miss Christine did say that
she won’t fire me at work.

194
00:22:25,302 --> 00:22:27,095
But what if she changes her mind?

195
00:22:29,014 --> 00:22:30,640
I don’t want to lose everything.

196
00:22:31,683 --> 00:22:33,852
It’s scary to think that I
might lose everything.

197
00:22:35,817 --> 00:22:39,278
I sold my body my
whole life just to get here.

198
00:22:42,168 --> 00:22:43,612
It’s scary.

199
00:22:43,612 --> 00:22:45,322
You’re overthinking again.

200
00:22:45,754 --> 00:22:47,702
You have a degree, Jasmine.

201
00:22:48,554 --> 00:22:50,764
You can apply for a lot of jobs.

202
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:54,748
So you know what’s going
on between me and Tom.

203
00:22:55,207 --> 00:22:57,709
I am so disappointed in you, Jasmine.

204
00:22:59,961 --> 00:23:02,213
What did I get myself into?

205
00:23:03,399 --> 00:23:04,901
Will I be able to leave?

206
00:23:06,843 --> 00:23:09,179
Haven't we gone through enough?

207
00:23:09,922 --> 00:23:11,715
You were able to turn a new leaf.

208
00:23:12,863 --> 00:23:13,936
You can handle this.

209
00:23:15,152 --> 00:23:16,269
I can handle this.

210
00:23:32,769 --> 00:23:35,943
Timmy, please ready the
tickets for tomorrow's concert.

211
00:23:35,968 --> 00:23:38,166
As well as the dinner
reservation I have with Jasmine.

212
00:23:38,166 --> 00:23:39,751
- Okay, sir.
- Thank you.

213
00:23:39,751 --> 00:23:41,253
- Come on?
- Let’s go!

214
00:23:56,637 --> 00:23:57,727
Ryan.

215
00:23:57,727 --> 00:23:58,854
No. Don’t.

216
00:23:58,854 --> 00:23:59,981
Stop, Ryan.

217
00:24:00,006 --> 00:24:01,145
- What?
- No.

218
00:24:01,170 --> 00:24:02,290
No, Ryan.

219
00:24:02,315 --> 00:24:04,651
Please, Ryan, I’m begging you.

220
00:24:05,133 --> 00:24:06,718
Please.

221
00:24:07,424 --> 00:24:10,449
Are you refusing me?

222
00:24:17,691 --> 00:24:20,516
<i>Until when are you going to
keep doing this to me, Ryan?</i>

223
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:22,898
As long as I feel like it.

224
00:24:23,767 --> 00:24:25,018
No, please.

225
00:24:27,159 --> 00:24:28,160
No.

226
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:30,510
You feel so good.

227
00:24:38,393 --> 00:24:39,811
<i>I don’t want this, Ryan.</i>

228
00:25:22,697 --> 00:25:24,040
What is this, Stella?

229
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:30,797
Documents transferring your shares and
your positions in Prima, to me.

230
00:25:32,871 --> 00:25:34,331
Have you gone mad?

231
00:25:38,488 --> 00:25:42,533
Christine, in exchange for this,
is what you’ve always wanted.

232
00:25:42,558 --> 00:25:44,080
What you’ve been looking for.

233
00:25:44,727 --> 00:25:49,440
Where and who your daughter, Lara, is.

234
00:25:50,968 --> 00:25:53,638
How can I be sure that
you’re telling the truth?

235
00:25:55,196 --> 00:25:56,948
Because you’re desperate?

236
00:25:57,472 --> 00:25:58,848
I’m desperate, too.

237
00:26:00,016 --> 00:26:01,184
It’s a win-win situation.

238
00:26:40,265 --> 00:26:46,563
If you sign that, you’ll know
who and where your daughter is.

239
00:27:36,265 --> 00:27:37,848
You can have Prima.

240
00:27:38,740 --> 00:27:41,201
Just tell me where my daughter is.

241
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,223
You know who she is.

242
00:27:47,664 --> 00:27:49,400
Jasmine Reyes.

243
00:27:55,602 --> 00:27:57,092
Jasmine Reyes.

244
00:28:02,203 --> 00:28:04,197
I’m sorry it has to come to this.

245
00:28:13,996 --> 00:28:15,819
I saw this in Ryan’s stuff.

246
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:19,184
That’s your private
investigator’s notebook.

247
00:28:20,404 --> 00:28:23,741
He’s the one who told me
that Jasmine is your daughter.

248
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,466
Lara.

249
00:28:49,868 --> 00:28:54,080
Christine, I’m happy for the both of you.

250
00:28:56,547 --> 00:28:58,585
Please be happy, okay?

251
00:29:00,758 --> 00:29:01,830
And thank you.

252
00:29:11,374 --> 00:29:12,375
My daughter.

253
00:29:15,253 --> 00:29:16,296
Jasmine.

254
00:29:19,007 --> 00:29:20,300
Jasmine.

255
00:29:20,325 --> 00:29:23,203
All I remember is the hatred in my heart.

256
00:29:25,610 --> 00:29:27,348
I’ll just choose–

257
00:29:28,508 --> 00:29:29,968
not to have them around.

258
00:29:31,911 --> 00:29:33,871
I’ve been used to it anyway.

259
00:29:48,495 --> 00:29:49,537
<i>Hello, Jasmine.</i>

260
00:29:50,487 --> 00:29:52,686
Ah hello, Miss Christine.

261
00:29:54,338 --> 00:29:56,059
Jasmine, can we talk?

262
00:29:58,829 --> 00:30:00,539
Can we just talk tomorrow?

263
00:30:01,309 --> 00:30:03,853
A lot has happened today,

264
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:06,166
I feel like taking a rest.

265
00:30:07,180 --> 00:30:11,518
I understand. Let’s meet tomorrow, please.

266
00:30:11,900 --> 00:30:14,486
What is this about?

267
00:30:15,725 --> 00:30:18,227
I was hoping to tell you in person.

268
00:30:20,276 --> 00:30:25,440
Okay, just text me where
we’ll meet tomorrow.

269
00:30:26,353 --> 00:30:27,479
All right.

270
00:30:30,453 --> 00:30:32,121
Take care, my dear.

271
00:30:37,456 --> 00:30:38,764
What, what did she say?

272
00:30:39,425 --> 00:30:41,635
I don’t know why she wants to meet.

273
00:30:42,363 --> 00:30:45,199
But her voice is different like–

274
00:30:45,749 --> 00:30:48,002
like she’ll break down any minute.

275
00:30:48,604 --> 00:30:49,609
Oh no.

276
00:30:49,841 --> 00:30:52,636
What if this is about Tom?

277
00:30:53,059 --> 00:30:55,853
But we have nothing else to talk about.

278
00:30:56,980 --> 00:30:59,399
Jasmine, what did you get yourself into?

279
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:02,001
You have to relax, just relax.

280
00:31:02,026 --> 00:31:04,612
Don’t overthink, Jasmine. Okay?

281
00:31:04,637 --> 00:31:06,361
That’s just how life is.

282
00:31:07,202 --> 00:31:10,039
That heart you are so careful not to hurt.

283
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:15,665
When you let other people in, you
no longer control what happens next.

284
00:31:15,665 --> 00:31:18,960
The important thing is
that you gave your all.

285
00:31:19,994 --> 00:31:22,286
Wow, where did that come from?

286
00:31:22,311 --> 00:31:26,065
Girl, I can be a love expert just
by watching all of your dramas.

287
00:31:26,090 --> 00:31:27,242
Just kidding.

288
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:32,267
- Just calm down, okay? Calm down.
- Whatever. Yeah, okay.

289
00:31:37,066 --> 00:31:38,400
How’s work?

290
00:31:38,784 --> 00:31:40,035
It’s okay, mom.

291
00:31:41,734 --> 00:31:43,278
I know you, Tom.

292
00:31:47,572 --> 00:31:49,324
Christine and I broke up.

293
00:31:50,477 --> 00:31:51,687
What happened?

294
00:31:52,563 --> 00:31:53,981
A lot happened.

295
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:57,702
I know it hurts.

296
00:32:00,308 --> 00:32:03,282
That’s how it is when you fall in love,

297
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:08,886
you give it your all so you
would really feel the pain.

298
00:32:10,303 --> 00:32:16,267
But many have told me that love
should be a two-way street, give and take.

299
00:32:17,484 --> 00:32:20,195
You should leave some for yourself.

300
00:32:21,050 --> 00:32:23,428
So that it won’t hurt if it ends.

301
00:32:26,178 --> 00:32:28,847
When your dad left us,

302
00:32:30,490 --> 00:32:37,705
I got hurt, but I never
regretted loving him so much.

303
00:32:38,404 --> 00:32:42,992
And I can love him even more now.

304
00:32:47,090 --> 00:32:48,925
How much do you love Christine?

305
00:32:50,973 --> 00:32:56,895
Only you can measure
the love that you can give.

306
00:32:58,268 --> 00:33:00,186
Are you ready to get hurt?

307
00:33:19,580 --> 00:33:22,417
Hello, dear. How are you?

308
00:33:30,883 --> 00:33:32,009
Hello, Sephy?

309
00:33:32,009 --> 00:33:35,054
Tin, is it true that you’re
no longer the CEO?

310
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:36,561
What happened?

311
00:33:38,984 --> 00:33:40,004
Wait.

312
00:33:41,750 --> 00:33:42,979
<i>Speaking of the devil.</i>

313
00:33:42,979 --> 00:33:46,649
<i>Gosh, I think this is the
comeback of the evil empire.</i>

314
00:33:46,674 --> 00:33:49,886
All right, I’ll call you later.

315
00:34:01,251 --> 00:34:02,777
Hello, everyone.

316
00:34:02,868 --> 00:34:04,203
Did you miss me?

317
00:34:05,344 --> 00:34:07,763
Mom, what’s going on?

318
00:34:08,896 --> 00:34:12,556
Ryan, I came to tell you that,

319
00:34:12,581 --> 00:34:16,252
I’m back as a CEO of Prima Beauty.

320
00:34:16,353 --> 00:34:20,732
Oh and by the way, Christine Soriano
will advise all of you via a formal memo.

321
00:34:20,757 --> 00:34:23,218
Wait, what are you talking about?

322
00:34:23,384 --> 00:34:25,177
Did you do this behind my back?

323
00:34:26,120 --> 00:34:27,747
Let’s talk later, okay?

324
00:34:28,243 --> 00:34:29,363
Mom.

325
00:34:31,748 --> 00:34:37,546
Ryan, don’t let your horns out.
A lot are watching, a lot are listening.

326
00:34:39,488 --> 00:34:40,489
Excuse me.

327
00:34:40,908 --> 00:34:41,954
Mom.

328
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:02,016
That was intense.

329
00:35:03,512 --> 00:35:06,265
Sorry, I wasn’t able to tell you.

330
00:35:06,290 --> 00:35:08,459
But, why give up?

331
00:35:08,644 --> 00:35:09,770
Why now?

332
00:35:10,714 --> 00:35:16,554
You know what would make me
give up everything, even Prima.

333
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:21,220
Wait, is this about your daughter?

334
00:35:24,705 --> 00:35:27,725
Christine gave me forty
percent of her shares.

335
00:35:27,750 --> 00:35:29,877
Making me the largest shareholder.

336
00:35:29,877 --> 00:35:34,257
And it is stipulated in the
contract that I am the new CEO.

337
00:35:34,282 --> 00:35:39,405
Mom, you can’t just
easily pass a position over.

338
00:35:39,430 --> 00:35:42,155
We have a say on the matter,
the board has a say on this.

339
00:35:42,546 --> 00:35:44,214
We’ll have it checked legally.

340
00:35:45,260 --> 00:35:47,470
Are you really not convinced
that this is authentic?

341
00:35:47,703 --> 00:35:51,457
Mom, this is business,
don’t take it personally.

342
00:35:53,204 --> 00:35:54,789
I know, Ryan.

343
00:35:55,111 --> 00:35:56,904
And as far as I can remember,

344
00:35:57,488 --> 00:35:59,782
I was the CEO of Prima for 10 years, right?

345
00:36:00,616 --> 00:36:03,661
Nothing will change with
the plans that have been set.

346
00:36:03,661 --> 00:36:05,705
This is just a change of leadership.

347
00:36:06,080 --> 00:36:09,000
So, let’s all keep
moving forward, all right?

348
00:36:21,811 --> 00:36:23,181
What are you doing?

349
00:36:23,472 --> 00:36:25,074
Why didn’t you tell me?

350
00:36:25,099 --> 00:36:26,642
You should’ve consulted me!

351
00:36:28,119 --> 00:36:31,289
Ryan, we waited for this, didn’t we?

352
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,733
I saw an opportunity so I grabbed it.

353
00:36:33,733 --> 00:36:36,027
Then how did you get her to sign?

354
00:36:37,028 --> 00:36:40,448
I gave her what she needed.
The red notebook in your drawer.

355
00:36:45,661 --> 00:36:47,455
You ruined my plans.

356
00:36:48,664 --> 00:36:50,917
I wanted Christine to be here,

357
00:36:51,584 --> 00:36:52,627
here!

358
00:36:53,334 --> 00:36:54,919
And you took her away from me.

359
00:36:57,232 --> 00:36:58,984
That’s exactly what I did.

360
00:36:59,009 --> 00:37:01,219
- I took her away from you.
- What?

361
00:37:01,219 --> 00:37:02,803
To save her from you.

362
00:37:02,828 --> 00:37:04,891
What the hell are you talking about?

363
00:37:05,222 --> 00:37:06,307
Ryan.

364
00:37:08,594 --> 00:37:09,602
Ryan!

365
00:37:09,602 --> 00:37:10,811
What are you doing?

366
00:37:11,896 --> 00:37:15,297
You promised me that you
would never be like your father.

367
00:37:15,322 --> 00:37:16,442
Oh fuck that!

368
00:37:16,442 --> 00:37:17,944
Yes, fuck that!

369
00:37:18,794 --> 00:37:20,588
Look at yourself right now.

370
00:37:20,613 --> 00:37:22,907
You’re killing people because of her.

371
00:37:23,741 --> 00:37:26,035
I can’t bear to look at you like this.

372
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:28,496
You’re even worse than your father!

373
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:39,008
What?

374
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,159
You’re angry?

375
00:37:41,641 --> 00:37:42,934
You wanna hurt me?

376
00:37:47,746 --> 00:37:50,833
No matter what you say or do,

377
00:37:51,333 --> 00:37:58,127
it won’t change the fact that I am
still the CEO of Prima and your mother.

378
00:38:00,493 --> 00:38:02,662
I’m better than my father.

379
00:38:04,659 --> 00:38:06,377
I know how to love.

380
00:38:08,452 --> 00:38:10,538
And I know how to stand up for myself.

381
00:38:12,563 --> 00:38:14,806
I fight for what I want.

382
00:38:17,791 --> 00:38:19,789
I’m not like my father, mom.

383
00:38:20,941 --> 00:38:23,026
With all his other girls out there.

384
00:38:25,133 --> 00:38:27,177
I only love Christine–

385
00:38:29,066 --> 00:38:30,693
and you took her away from me.

386
00:38:32,546 --> 00:38:33,881
No, Ryan.

387
00:38:34,729 --> 00:38:39,317
You only love yourself
and your fucking ego.

388
00:38:48,409 --> 00:38:49,618
Fuck!

389
00:38:50,703 --> 00:38:51,871
Fuck!

390
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:53,026
Go ahead.

391
00:38:53,644 --> 00:38:54,932
You wanna go crazy?

392
00:38:54,957 --> 00:38:56,250
That’s what’s happening to you.

393
00:38:56,250 --> 00:39:00,129
You better stop this, Ryan, because
you’re going mad. You’re going mad!

394
00:39:00,324 --> 00:39:01,534
I’m not done.

395
00:39:03,260 --> 00:39:06,555
Taking Prima away from
Christine was a mistake.

396
00:39:07,236 --> 00:39:08,358
Oh yeah?

397
00:39:09,568 --> 00:39:12,571
Go ahead, prove me wrong.

398
00:39:50,932 --> 00:39:52,056
Hold on.

399
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:55,020
I’ll show you something.

400
00:39:55,565 --> 00:39:56,685
Here.

401
00:39:59,680 --> 00:40:01,432
Oh wow, it’s Jasmine.

402
00:40:02,650 --> 00:40:04,068
This is very good, babe.

403
00:40:04,068 --> 00:40:05,152
I know.

404
00:40:05,404 --> 00:40:07,323
This will ruin them.

405
00:40:45,593 --> 00:40:48,137
I’m so sorry, Miss Christine.

406
00:40:55,146 --> 00:40:58,399
I have terribly offended you.

407
00:41:00,958 --> 00:41:06,046
I loved him even though
he loved someone else.

408
00:41:10,759 --> 00:41:13,596
It wasn’t intentional but

409
00:41:16,205 --> 00:41:18,373
what’s worse is that

410
00:41:19,157 --> 00:41:21,945
my rival is the person

411
00:41:22,907 --> 00:41:28,610
I admire the most. My inspiration.

412
00:41:29,336 --> 00:41:31,694
Who am I, right?

413
00:41:32,930 --> 00:41:36,016
Who am I compared to you?

414
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:41,813
At first I was happy,

415
00:41:43,396 --> 00:41:46,235
but I realized that it wasn’t okay,

416
00:41:47,483 --> 00:41:50,009
that we were hurting someone,

417
00:41:50,775 --> 00:41:53,111
and that he wasn’t happy with me.

418
00:41:56,301 --> 00:41:58,899
He still loves you,

419
00:42:00,100 --> 00:42:01,769
Miss Christine.

420
00:42:03,938 --> 00:42:07,316
That's what I see, that’s what I feel.

421
00:42:07,341 --> 00:42:13,524
I kept pushing it, but I can see in
his eyes that it’s you that he loves.

422
00:42:16,413 --> 00:42:19,328
You’re the one he needs, Miss Christine.

423
00:42:20,562 --> 00:42:22,564
I’m so sorry.

424
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,547
I’m ready to understand you,

425
00:42:33,634 --> 00:42:37,429
to forgive you for everything you’ve done.

426
00:42:40,057 --> 00:42:42,059
I’m here to–

427
00:42:42,299 --> 00:42:45,719
to make up for all the
things I couldn’t give you.

428
00:42:52,903 --> 00:42:54,029
Jasmine,

429
00:42:54,767 --> 00:42:56,810
I have something to tell you.

430
00:43:00,376 --> 00:43:02,378
I hope you can accept.

431
00:43:58,052 --> 00:44:00,637
<i>Jasmine, there are posts
going viral on social media.</i>

432
00:44:00,637 --> 00:44:02,598
<i>Huh? What is it?</i>

433
00:44:02,903 --> 00:44:04,892
I’m so sorry, Miss Christine.

434
00:44:04,892 --> 00:44:07,770
Anton, I want you to come
up with a press release.

435
00:44:07,770 --> 00:44:12,191
Announcing that we’re removing Jasmine
in our Prima Perfume line.

436
00:44:13,192 --> 00:44:14,777
They only know the name “Jasmine”.

437
00:44:14,777 --> 00:44:16,904
But none of you know
anything about her life

438
00:44:16,904 --> 00:44:19,507
so you have no right to speak badly of her.

439
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:22,743
Because none of you have any idea
how she ended up in such a life.

440
00:44:26,372 --> 00:44:27,790
Lara!

441
00:44:29,082 --> 00:44:30,667
Lara?

442
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,468
Why now?

443
00:44:33,305 --> 00:44:35,182
Why did you leave me?

444
00:44:36,227 --> 00:44:39,063
Everything that happened
to you is my fault.

445
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:41,532
You became rich! You had a better life!

446
00:44:41,557 --> 00:44:44,643
You don’t even know
what I did just to survive.

447
00:44:44,681 --> 00:44:47,726
I lived in the streets because
I didn’t have a mother.

448
00:44:47,726 --> 00:44:50,354
I became a prostitute
because I didn’t have a mother.

449
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:53,690
I was deprived of affection
because I didn’t have a mother!
