1
00:00:04,838 --> 00:00:06,798
I’d like to ask you something.

2
00:00:11,311 --> 00:00:12,347
Hello?

3
00:00:12,500 --> 00:00:14,305
I had fun Jasmine.

4
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:15,782
I enjoyed your company.

5
00:00:15,807 --> 00:00:18,601
I enjoyed your company
more, Miss Christine.

6
00:00:18,626 --> 00:00:20,484
I wish you were my mother.

7
00:00:20,509 --> 00:00:22,427
My life would’ve been happier.

8
00:00:23,085 --> 00:00:24,417
Why so serious?

9
00:00:24,585 --> 00:00:27,193
What do you call it when you love someone,

10
00:00:27,218 --> 00:00:28,906
but you’re also attracted to someone else?

11
00:00:29,179 --> 00:00:30,233
That’s cool.

12
00:00:30,765 --> 00:00:32,613
Congratulations.

13
00:00:32,638 --> 00:00:33,758
Miss Christine.

14
00:00:33,783 --> 00:00:35,414
I’m glad you’re here too.

15
00:00:35,439 --> 00:00:37,149
Can’t I have fun as well?

16
00:00:40,307 --> 00:00:42,531
I really like him.

17
00:00:42,657 --> 00:00:44,843
This is my first time feeling
this way, Miss Christine.

18
00:00:45,334 --> 00:00:49,396
I like him so much that it’s
starting to affect my work.

19
00:00:49,421 --> 00:00:51,617
If he can't give you what you need,

20
00:00:51,781 --> 00:00:52,849
then let go.

21
00:00:53,109 --> 00:00:55,232
I already lost my daughter.

22
00:00:55,257 --> 00:00:58,203
I can’t afford to lose you too.

23
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:39,289
Yo!

24
00:02:39,314 --> 00:02:40,690
Can’t get a ride? Hop in.

25
00:02:41,071 --> 00:02:42,401
I booked one already.

26
00:02:43,446 --> 00:02:45,263
You booked a ride or a client?

27
00:02:58,553 --> 00:02:59,631
What are you doing?

28
00:03:01,089 --> 00:03:03,383
What did you book? Is it a client or a car?

29
00:03:05,093 --> 00:03:07,332
If you don’t want to be in a scandal,

30
00:03:07,588 --> 00:03:09,506
pretend that you don’t know me.

31
00:03:09,936 --> 00:03:12,305
Or maybe you want to be in
the news with the headlines,

32
00:03:12,964 --> 00:03:17,219
"A Prima Beauty executive
is having sex with a minor.”

33
00:03:18,144 --> 00:03:21,022
Correction, I had no idea
that you were underage then.

34
00:03:23,593 --> 00:03:24,841
My ride is here.

35
00:03:26,237 --> 00:03:27,348
What did you say?

36
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,391
What did you say?

37
00:03:28,416 --> 00:03:29,687
My booked ride is here.

38
00:03:30,512 --> 00:03:32,765
Then should I pay you to come with me?

39
00:03:34,944 --> 00:03:37,179
I haven’t done that job in a long time.

40
00:03:38,374 --> 00:03:39,969
I am the new face of Prima beauty

41
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:41,649
-remember?
-I don't care.

42
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,651
"Breaking news, the new
face of Prima Beauty,

43
00:03:47,912 --> 00:03:50,623
together with her friend, are found dead."

44
00:03:51,476 --> 00:03:53,015
How do you like that?

45
00:03:54,703 --> 00:03:55,849
Get in the car!

46
00:03:56,664 --> 00:03:57,737
Get in!

47
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:34,474
I saw the updates of
the Prima Events earlier.

48
00:04:34,499 --> 00:04:36,286
You were with Christine?

49
00:04:36,311 --> 00:04:38,122
What were you two talking about?

50
00:04:39,864 --> 00:04:41,465
I just thanked her.

51
00:04:43,180 --> 00:04:45,575
I know your lying Jasmine, come on.

52
00:04:46,969 --> 00:04:50,014
I’m actually dating someone.

53
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:53,960
We’re not okay right now since
he has his other priorities.

54
00:04:55,270 --> 00:04:59,316
The problem is, I really like him.

55
00:05:00,989 --> 00:05:03,403
This is my first time feeling
this way, Miss Christine.

56
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:13,505
You were right about Miss Christine.

57
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,899
Once she gets what she wants,

58
00:05:17,264 --> 00:05:19,016
she’ll leave you hanging.

59
00:05:19,569 --> 00:05:21,508
So you believed her?

60
00:05:22,491 --> 00:05:24,407
She tried getting close to you?

61
00:05:24,967 --> 00:05:28,411
Did she mention to you that,
she considers you as her daughter?

62
00:05:28,638 --> 00:05:30,323
She tells that to everyone.

63
00:05:31,748 --> 00:05:33,624
So she’s just pretending to be motherly?

64
00:05:33,649 --> 00:05:34,827
Exactly.

65
00:05:35,175 --> 00:05:38,094
She doesn’t care if she’ll hurt others.

66
00:05:38,663 --> 00:05:41,458
If it would boost her life
and career, she’ll do it.

67
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:43,924
So she’s just selfish?

68
00:05:47,435 --> 00:05:49,066
That’s all we talked about.

69
00:05:50,350 --> 00:05:51,371
Okay.

70
00:05:52,335 --> 00:05:54,064
That’s all I need to know.

71
00:05:54,974 --> 00:05:56,274
You can go now.

72
00:05:56,299 --> 00:05:57,415
Ah!

73
00:05:57,440 --> 00:05:58,671
By the way, Jasmine,

74
00:05:59,854 --> 00:06:01,731
this talk we had

75
00:06:01,756 --> 00:06:03,613
don’t let others know about it

76
00:06:03,638 --> 00:06:05,156
if you don’t want them involved.

77
00:06:22,046 --> 00:06:24,391
You are so full of yourself.

78
00:06:27,787 --> 00:06:30,702
I think I found the key
to your secret, Christine.

79
00:06:32,013 --> 00:06:34,724
I think I’m gonna find
that guy you're hiding.

80
00:06:48,159 --> 00:06:50,782
Our set up stays the same, okay?

81
00:06:52,229 --> 00:06:54,882
We still can’t see each other until

82
00:06:55,834 --> 00:06:57,795
everything cools down.

83
00:07:21,732 --> 00:07:22,859
Are you okay?

84
00:07:23,324 --> 00:07:25,118
You’ve been quiet the whole time.

85
00:07:29,042 --> 00:07:31,075
I’ve been thinking, Tom.

86
00:07:32,902 --> 00:07:35,384
I think we should stop this.

87
00:07:35,409 --> 00:07:36,433
Huh?

88
00:07:39,464 --> 00:07:41,925
I know that Miss
Christine is your girlfriend.

89
00:07:49,298 --> 00:07:51,012
I don’t want to deceive her.

90
00:07:52,833 --> 00:07:56,878
I don't want to make myself
believe that we can be together.

91
00:08:00,704 --> 00:08:02,708
I know how much you love her.

92
00:08:06,493 --> 00:08:07,952
I’m sorry, Jasmine.

93
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:12,360
I should’ve controlled my
feelings for you, but I couldn’t.

94
00:08:14,461 --> 00:08:16,557
You don’t have to apologize, Tom.

95
00:08:18,461 --> 00:08:19,727
I hope.

96
00:08:22,118 --> 00:08:24,295
I just hope you’ll be happy with her.

97
00:08:51,911 --> 00:08:53,574
- Hello?
- Hello, Boss Ryan?

98
00:08:53,638 --> 00:08:54,992
I got their picture.

99
00:08:55,615 --> 00:08:58,412
That's good. Send it to me now.

100
00:08:59,451 --> 00:09:00,508
Please.

101
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,549
Finally,

102
00:09:06,808 --> 00:09:09,769
I know who you’re hiding, Christine.

103
00:09:29,553 --> 00:09:30,959
Well, what do you know?

104
00:09:31,818 --> 00:09:34,493
A mother and daughter
hooking up with the same guy.

105
00:09:35,896 --> 00:09:37,354
If only they knew.

106
00:09:42,092 --> 00:09:43,377
Come on!

107
00:09:44,021 --> 00:09:46,875
What else do you want from me?
I’ve told you everything.

108
00:09:48,102 --> 00:09:50,229
Are you still looking for your mother?

109
00:09:50,857 --> 00:09:52,101
My mother?

110
00:09:53,021 --> 00:09:55,096
How did you know about my mother?

111
00:09:55,592 --> 00:09:57,674
Let’s just say, I took a guess.

112
00:09:57,982 --> 00:10:02,101
Since you gave fake identities of your
parents to the H.R. Department.

113
00:10:02,583 --> 00:10:04,123
Who are you really, Jasmine?

114
00:10:05,802 --> 00:10:07,212
What do you want?

115
00:10:08,013 --> 00:10:09,668
Do I owe you anything?

116
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:11,277
What do you want me to do?

117
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,596
That’s what I want to hear.

118
00:10:34,153 --> 00:10:36,754
- Are you following me?
- Wait, wait.

119
00:10:37,639 --> 00:10:39,180
Don’t feel alarmed, Jasmine.

120
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:43,381
I just want to know who’s the guy
you mentioned that Christine let go.

121
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:46,726
- What’s in it for you?
- Why are you being defensive? Wait.

122
00:10:47,107 --> 00:10:49,523
You haven't heard what I have to offer.

123
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:53,688
This man has nothing to do with this.

124
00:10:53,713 --> 00:10:55,446
Oh come on, Jasmine.

125
00:10:55,471 --> 00:10:57,056
Let’s not kid ourselves.

126
00:10:57,545 --> 00:10:58,908
You’re easy to read,

127
00:10:59,107 --> 00:11:00,576
eyes don’t lie.

128
00:11:01,943 --> 00:11:04,413
You love that man, but he’s with Christine.

129
00:11:05,317 --> 00:11:08,497
Now he’s being neglected
so it’s affecting you.

130
00:11:08,685 --> 00:11:11,065
And now, you’re the
one who’s being ignored.

131
00:11:11,090 --> 00:11:12,154
Am I right?

132
00:11:13,068 --> 00:11:15,257
Miss Christine doesn’t deserve Tom.

133
00:11:15,282 --> 00:11:19,006
Tom really doesn’t deserve Christine.

134
00:11:19,975 --> 00:11:22,056
He’s not the right person for her.

135
00:11:23,194 --> 00:11:24,691
She needs someone–

136
00:11:25,083 --> 00:11:27,537
someone who can be faithful to her.

137
00:11:27,562 --> 00:11:29,188
Someone like me.

138
00:11:29,248 --> 00:11:31,399
Who truly loves her, right?

139
00:11:33,014 --> 00:11:34,059
Oh well.

140
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,823
I’m doing this because I’m
offering you the chance to have Tom.

141
00:11:39,561 --> 00:11:42,343
And when Christine sees those photos,

142
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:44,954
I’m pretty sure they’ll break up.

143
00:11:44,954 --> 00:11:47,123
Don’t you like that
win-win situation for us?

144
00:11:48,490 --> 00:11:50,324
This is not what I want.

145
00:11:54,445 --> 00:11:57,614
Well, if you don’t take
Tom away from Christine,

146
00:11:57,639 --> 00:12:00,857
I’ll take matters into my own hands.

147
00:12:01,527 --> 00:12:02,862
How do you like that?

148
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:07,938
You’re the worst.

149
00:12:08,397 --> 00:12:12,192
I’m fucking doing this
for Christine’s sake.

150
00:12:12,638 --> 00:12:15,248
I’m just saving her from you and Tom.

151
00:12:36,289 --> 00:12:38,624
What happened to you?
Why do you look like that?

152
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,376
It’s nothing.

153
00:12:43,221 --> 00:12:44,320
Marie,

154
00:12:45,847 --> 00:12:47,561
what happened to you?

155
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,851
Come on, Jasmine, it’s
not like this is anything new.

156
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:58,600
I thought you were going to quit the club?

157
00:12:59,752 --> 00:13:02,536
I’ve already accepted that
this is going to be my life, Jasmine.

158
00:13:10,153 --> 00:13:11,749
Just leave.

159
00:13:13,685 --> 00:13:17,922
You’re just accepting it because
you think there's no other choice.

160
00:13:18,614 --> 00:13:20,721
But you do have a choice, Marie.

161
00:13:23,732 --> 00:13:25,653
I’ll help you.

162
00:13:27,550 --> 00:13:28,918
I’ll take care of you.

163
00:13:32,853 --> 00:13:34,583
I was able to leave, see?

164
00:13:36,478 --> 00:13:38,582
I know that you can too.

165
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:43,835
You have me,

166
00:13:44,239 --> 00:13:46,699
how many times do I have to remind you?

167
00:14:14,866 --> 00:14:16,627
What’s that? It’s already late.

168
00:14:16,652 --> 00:14:18,024
It’s for you, ma’am.

169
00:15:00,782 --> 00:15:01,892
Hilda.

170
00:15:01,917 --> 00:15:03,152
Come in, have a seat.

171
00:15:04,344 --> 00:15:05,856
What did you do to him?

172
00:15:06,782 --> 00:15:07,854
What?

173
00:15:07,879 --> 00:15:09,095
What are you talking about?

174
00:15:10,384 --> 00:15:12,325
You had my boyfriend killed.

175
00:15:13,587 --> 00:15:14,652
Hilda,

176
00:15:14,820 --> 00:15:18,929
you better think about what you’re saying.
You don’t know who you’re dealing with.

177
00:15:19,704 --> 00:15:21,151
You had him killed

178
00:15:21,470 --> 00:15:23,130
because you thought

179
00:15:23,244 --> 00:15:25,354
that he was Christine’s secret boyfriend.

180
00:15:26,125 --> 00:15:27,524
I had no idea

181
00:15:27,876 --> 00:15:30,012
that you were worse than your father.

182
00:15:32,017 --> 00:15:33,870
You have no proof, Hilda.

183
00:15:34,454 --> 00:15:36,977
And if that information
came from Christine,

184
00:15:37,002 --> 00:15:38,687
you quickly believed her?

185
00:15:41,829 --> 00:15:43,400
I know you, Ryan.

186
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:45,903
You better watch out.

187
00:15:46,900 --> 00:15:48,781
With what you’re doing,

188
00:15:49,712 --> 00:15:52,279
you’re pushing Christine
further away from you.

189
00:16:14,765 --> 00:16:19,103
All right son, go to sleep. Don’t
play your mobile games anymore.

190
00:16:19,103 --> 00:16:21,355
But there’s no school tomorrow, Ma.

191
00:16:21,355 --> 00:16:23,607
Since there’s no school, just let him be.

192
00:16:23,607 --> 00:16:24,775
Thank you, Pa!

193
00:16:24,775 --> 00:16:27,611
Don't spoil him too much.

194
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:30,948
I heard the gate open.

195
00:16:39,775 --> 00:16:40,913
Tom, wait.

196
00:16:51,024 --> 00:16:52,529
Don’t avoid me.

197
00:16:54,447 --> 00:16:56,771
Let’s get this over with.

198
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,728
You were gone for four years.

199
00:17:01,064 --> 00:17:02,855
And you think I'll
get over it that easily?

200
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:04,214
Forgive me, son.

201
00:17:05,933 --> 00:17:10,062
But I had to do it for
the sake of all our lives.

202
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,044
You chose money over us.

203
00:17:13,069 --> 00:17:15,619
It’s such a shallow
reason, I can’t accept it.

204
00:17:16,548 --> 00:17:19,163
What do you want me to
do, so you can forgive me?

205
00:17:19,501 --> 00:17:20,748
Curse me!

206
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,962
Hit me!

207
00:17:22,153 --> 00:17:23,742
Get it all out!

208
00:17:26,118 --> 00:17:27,253
But remember,

209
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,795
I never stopped loving all of you.

210
00:17:33,399 --> 00:17:34,766
As much as I want,

211
00:17:35,782 --> 00:17:37,686
I can’t change the past.

212
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:40,918
I just hope that one day,

213
00:17:41,212 --> 00:17:42,728
you can forgive me.

214
00:18:13,613 --> 00:18:15,781
I just want you to be my wife.

215
00:18:19,570 --> 00:18:22,614
I want to spend the rest of
my life waking up with you.

216
00:18:23,476 --> 00:18:25,454
I love you so much, Christine.

217
00:18:26,821 --> 00:18:30,574
I will continue loving you,
whatever your decision will be.

218
00:18:31,086 --> 00:18:32,921
Love, Tom.

219
00:18:50,810 --> 00:18:52,769
Take care of it, okay?

220
00:18:53,882 --> 00:18:56,051
I had fun Jasmine.

221
00:18:56,051 --> 00:18:57,886
I enjoyed your company.

222
00:18:57,886 --> 00:19:00,973
I enjoyed your company
more, Miss Christine.

223
00:19:00,973 --> 00:19:03,016
I wish you were my mother.

224
00:19:03,334 --> 00:19:05,711
My life would’ve been happier.

225
00:19:32,108 --> 00:19:34,423
Were all the departments given food?

226
00:19:34,423 --> 00:19:35,632
Yes sir, everyone got it.

227
00:19:35,632 --> 00:19:36,858
That’s good.

228
00:19:36,883 --> 00:19:38,027
Everyone!

229
00:19:38,714 --> 00:19:41,174
Cheers!

230
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:44,370
Congrats to us, our efforts paid off.

231
00:19:45,162 --> 00:19:47,482
Our first batch has sold out in the market.

232
00:19:47,507 --> 00:19:51,928
And our local partners are
requesting for the next batch.

233
00:19:51,953 --> 00:19:55,241
So, congratulations.

234
00:19:55,266 --> 00:19:57,184
And–

235
00:19:57,209 --> 00:19:58,572
To thank everyone,

236
00:19:58,840 --> 00:20:03,374
we'll be having a thanksgiving party and
that will be scheduled next week.

237
00:20:03,839 --> 00:20:05,380
I wanna see you all there.

238
00:20:05,405 --> 00:20:06,782
Especially you, Jasmine.

239
00:20:07,723 --> 00:20:10,517
Thank you, but I’m sorry,

240
00:20:10,542 --> 00:20:12,711
I’m not free next week.

241
00:20:12,711 --> 00:20:14,004
I have plans.

242
00:20:16,473 --> 00:20:18,198
Just come, Jasmine.

243
00:20:18,563 --> 00:20:22,364
This will be my thanks for everything
you have done here at Prima.

244
00:20:23,125 --> 00:20:25,198
Also for teaching me that,

245
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:28,379
there’s something more
important than my career.

246
00:20:29,524 --> 00:20:32,152
Thank you very much.

247
00:20:35,496 --> 00:20:36,641
Congrats.

248
00:20:37,214 --> 00:20:38,503
Cheers, guys.

249
00:20:38,528 --> 00:20:40,489
Cheers!

250
00:20:55,996 --> 00:20:57,028
Hey, girl!

251
00:20:57,653 --> 00:20:59,046
Why do you look so down?

252
00:20:59,794 --> 00:21:01,437
Enjoy the fruits of your labor.

253
00:21:02,730 --> 00:21:04,003
Want me to feed you?

254
00:21:05,479 --> 00:21:08,107
I can feed myself, you know.

255
00:21:08,389 --> 00:21:10,474
So, why do you look so sad?

256
00:21:15,848 --> 00:21:17,033
It’s nothing.

257
00:21:18,137 --> 00:21:21,745
I just realized how simple
our lives were before.

258
00:21:24,276 --> 00:21:26,097
After work,

259
00:21:26,847 --> 00:21:28,887
we would just rest or study.

260
00:21:31,714 --> 00:21:34,049
The world is so complicated.

261
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:38,178
I didn’t realize that it was scary.

262
00:21:41,542 --> 00:21:44,837
You know, feeling scared is normal.

263
00:21:45,595 --> 00:21:48,849
We don’t know what’s gonna
happen in the coming days.

264
00:21:49,933 --> 00:21:51,476
What’s important

265
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:53,645
is that you end the day, feeling happy.

266
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:55,689
You’re happy, right?

267
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,551
Am I?

268
00:21:59,576 --> 00:22:00,736
I think so.

269
00:22:00,736 --> 00:22:02,821
Here, you’re not eating.

270
00:22:19,171 --> 00:22:21,290
There, put some blush on.

271
00:22:23,052 --> 00:22:24,915
Look at you, girl.

272
00:22:24,940 --> 00:22:28,235
Thanks a lot for helping me out.

273
00:22:29,574 --> 00:22:31,492
This is my new life now.

274
00:22:31,855 --> 00:22:34,805
I am the stylist, the make up artist,

275
00:22:34,845 --> 00:22:37,361
the executive assistant of the prettiest

276
00:22:37,361 --> 00:22:39,352
-woman in the world,
- What are you talking about?

277
00:22:39,377 --> 00:22:41,563
- Miss Jasmine Reyes.
- Don’t be silly.

278
00:22:41,588 --> 00:22:43,882
Oh come on, it’s just me.

279
00:22:43,907 --> 00:22:45,781
Why didn’t I think of this before?

280
00:22:45,781 --> 00:22:47,491
This is easy, and besides–

281
00:22:48,359 --> 00:22:49,760
there’s so many hotties.

282
00:22:49,785 --> 00:22:51,536
This is great.

283
00:22:53,371 --> 00:22:54,539
Tom’s looking.

284
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:57,260
Such a flirt!

285
00:22:57,988 --> 00:22:59,200
You tease.

286
00:23:00,758 --> 00:23:01,808
Wait up.

287
00:23:04,841 --> 00:23:06,593
Listen everyone, listen.

288
00:23:06,618 --> 00:23:08,605
Before we start the party.

289
00:23:08,803 --> 00:23:10,888
Miss Christine will give a short message.

290
00:23:11,322 --> 00:23:12,520
Miss Christine?

291
00:23:29,147 --> 00:23:31,024
- She’s so sexy.
- Dang!

292
00:23:31,049 --> 00:23:32,683
She’s so hot. That’s my idol.

293
00:23:33,019 --> 00:23:34,221
First for of all,

294
00:23:34,246 --> 00:23:37,124
I’d like to call
Jasmine, to join me.

295
00:23:37,124 --> 00:23:38,558
- Me? Is it me?
- You, yeah you.

296
00:23:38,855 --> 00:23:39,962
Thank you.

297
00:23:44,214 --> 00:23:48,051
I just wanted to acknowledge
your dedication to Prima.

298
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:51,817
For canceling your personal plans.

299
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:53,281
So that–

300
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:55,517
you can celebrate with us.

301
00:23:56,369 --> 00:23:58,996
I made the right choice in making you

302
00:23:59,397 --> 00:24:02,150
the new face of my company.

303
00:24:03,309 --> 00:24:05,862
You are a part of Prima’s success.

304
00:24:07,136 --> 00:24:08,547
And thank you,

305
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:10,198
for making sure that

306
00:24:10,474 --> 00:24:12,434
my staff are enjoying themselves.

307
00:24:14,184 --> 00:24:17,103
Be it a woman or a man.

308
00:24:18,420 --> 00:24:20,088
You really are an angel.

309
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:24,616
Thank you everyone, so let’s have fun.

310
00:24:33,216 --> 00:24:35,385
Then let’s start the party!

311
00:24:37,981 --> 00:24:40,025
Here, let’s start drinking.

312
00:24:40,379 --> 00:24:41,771
- Hi, sir!
- Thank you.

313
00:24:41,771 --> 00:24:43,773
- Go ahead sir, I’ll stay here.
- Thank you.

314
00:24:55,394 --> 00:24:56,703
Yeah, this is my shot.

315
00:24:56,703 --> 00:24:58,456
Wait a minute, I’ll be back.

316
00:24:59,487 --> 00:25:01,197
Hmm, hold on.

317
00:25:02,531 --> 00:25:05,242
Jasmine, hi.

318
00:25:07,709 --> 00:25:12,046
Now you know why Tom’s
head over heels for her.

319
00:25:13,105 --> 00:25:14,310
Right?

320
00:25:14,346 --> 00:25:17,641
She’s incredibly sexy and beautiful.

321
00:25:21,057 --> 00:25:24,120
By the way, she’s my stepmom.

322
00:25:24,423 --> 00:25:25,878
Should I be jealous?

323
00:25:53,426 --> 00:25:54,636
It’s so hot.

324
00:25:56,394 --> 00:25:57,555
Yeah.

325
00:25:58,468 --> 00:26:01,808
Do you mean the weather or Miss Christine?

326
00:26:16,471 --> 00:26:18,515
Being alone doesn’t suit you.

327
00:26:20,682 --> 00:26:22,726
You can accompany me if you want.

328
00:26:56,277 --> 00:26:57,563
What did I do?

329
00:26:58,193 --> 00:26:59,778
What did you do?

330
00:27:01,598 --> 00:27:03,019
This is you, right?

331
00:27:04,652 --> 00:27:05,933
Why, Tom?

332
00:27:07,330 --> 00:27:09,034
Are you tired of me?

333
00:27:09,332 --> 00:27:11,494
That’s why you replaced
me with someone younger?

334
00:27:13,173 --> 00:27:14,841
Are you not happy with me?

335
00:27:16,660 --> 00:27:18,018
Let me explain.

336
00:27:19,346 --> 00:27:20,930
How will you explain this?

337
00:27:20,930 --> 00:27:23,395
It’s obvious that you’re having an affair.

338
00:27:24,854 --> 00:27:26,335
How long has this been going?

339
00:27:26,977 --> 00:27:29,722
Were you with her during
the nights we weren’t together?

340
00:27:30,166 --> 00:27:32,028
How many times did you two do it?

341
00:27:32,053 --> 00:27:34,193
How many times?

342
00:27:34,527 --> 00:27:36,196
- I’m sorry, please let me-
- No!

343
00:27:36,196 --> 00:27:37,906
- Let me explain.
- No.

344
00:27:37,931 --> 00:27:41,747
That time, I thought we broke up.
I couldn’t even call you.

345
00:27:42,079 --> 00:27:44,943
I had no idea what our
status was at that time.

346
00:27:44,968 --> 00:27:46,075
Sorry.

347
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:51,052
You looked for someone else because
I rejected your proposal?

348
00:27:51,934 --> 00:27:54,244
How long have you been deceiving me?

349
00:27:54,779 --> 00:27:58,607
While you were having sex with me,
you were also having sex with her?

350
00:27:58,973 --> 00:28:01,029
What kind of person are you?

351
00:28:04,067 --> 00:28:05,482
I was just lonely.

352
00:28:05,507 --> 00:28:06,724
And weak.

353
00:28:08,223 --> 00:28:10,263
That wasn’t weakness, Tom.

354
00:28:11,536 --> 00:28:15,125
You thought you weren’t gonna
get caught, that’s why you did it.

355
00:28:16,743 --> 00:28:18,606
But you were caught.

356
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:21,935
Do you love her?

357
00:28:30,580 --> 00:28:31,935
Love, I’m sorry.

358
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,082
- I’m sorry.
- Don’t you dare call me “Love.”

359
00:28:35,363 --> 00:28:37,991
I can’t even look at you, get out.

360
00:28:38,573 --> 00:28:40,275
Get out!

361
00:28:40,730 --> 00:28:42,056
Leave!

362
00:28:42,784 --> 00:28:44,034
Sorry.

363
00:30:06,166 --> 00:30:07,292
Sorry.

364
00:30:07,697 --> 00:30:09,073
No, I can’t.

365
00:30:09,682 --> 00:30:10,934
I just can’t.

366
00:30:12,449 --> 00:30:13,575
I’m sorry.

367
00:30:21,260 --> 00:30:22,500
Fuck.

368
00:30:27,966 --> 00:30:29,426
Have you seen Jasmine?

369
00:30:29,958 --> 00:30:32,994
No, I’ve also been looking for Tom.

370
00:30:33,497 --> 00:30:36,083
Well, you know the possibilities.

371
00:30:37,514 --> 00:30:39,892
My job with Jasmine’s over now so–

372
00:30:39,917 --> 00:30:41,105
Let’s go?

373
00:30:41,130 --> 00:30:42,635
So, we’re gonna have fun too?

374
00:30:42,971 --> 00:30:44,592
- Let’s go?
- Come on.

375
00:31:38,203 --> 00:31:42,500
Sis, can you stop blaming yourself?

376
00:31:43,507 --> 00:31:45,114
It’s Tom who cheated,

377
00:31:45,545 --> 00:31:47,526
this is all his fault.

378
00:31:48,395 --> 00:31:51,231
And what he did isn’t justified.

379
00:31:52,005 --> 00:31:55,577
I’m also a secret of my boyfriend.

380
00:31:56,656 --> 00:31:59,500
I can be myself in Manila,
but we can’t show off

381
00:31:59,500 --> 00:32:02,300
our relationship in public because of him.

382
00:32:02,521 --> 00:32:06,275
But I will never, ever cheat on him.

383
00:32:07,161 --> 00:32:10,164
Maybe I gave him a reason to cheat.

384
00:32:12,821 --> 00:32:13,961
First,

385
00:32:15,642 --> 00:32:17,560
I rejected his proposal.

386
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:20,389
Second,

387
00:32:21,984 --> 00:32:24,320
I told him that we shouldn’t meet.

388
00:32:27,309 --> 00:32:31,021
Maybe Jasmine is giving
Tom the affection he needs

389
00:32:31,658 --> 00:32:33,242
right now.

390
00:32:36,624 --> 00:32:37,756
Sis,

391
00:32:38,523 --> 00:32:39,632
look at you.

392
00:32:40,235 --> 00:32:42,350
You’re the victim here.

393
00:32:42,670 --> 00:32:46,591
And please stop justifying the
reason why Tom cheated on you.

394
00:32:46,943 --> 00:32:48,890
He’s just a flirt.

395
00:32:49,065 --> 00:32:50,280
Definitely.

396
00:32:50,630 --> 00:32:54,578
That’s why he couldn’t stick to
just one person, and got Jasmine.

397
00:32:54,837 --> 00:32:57,734
And that Jasmine–

398
00:32:57,848 --> 00:32:59,558
I thought she was an angel.

399
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,734
Apparently, she’s a bitch.

400
00:33:14,293 --> 00:33:15,713
So, what’s your plan?

401
00:33:16,118 --> 00:33:17,953
How will you get Christine tonight?

402
00:35:15,768 --> 00:35:17,218
Don’t sit.

403
00:35:20,159 --> 00:35:22,703
What, are you nervous?

404
00:35:24,875 --> 00:35:26,105
You should be.

405
00:35:34,797 --> 00:35:36,961
So you know what’s going
on between me and Tom.

406
00:35:38,899 --> 00:35:40,493
I don’t have a boyfriend.

407
00:35:40,518 --> 00:35:41,899
I let him go.

408
00:35:41,924 --> 00:35:43,868
I want to focus more on Prima.

409
00:35:43,893 --> 00:35:48,314
Instead of focusing on people that
can possibly ruin my plans in life.

410
00:35:52,613 --> 00:35:55,824
You knew, but you still did it.

411
00:36:00,879 --> 00:36:03,256
I am so disappointed in you, Jasmine.

412
00:36:05,204 --> 00:36:06,414
Look me in the eye.

413
00:36:08,499 --> 00:36:10,084
Look me in the eye.

414
00:36:12,485 --> 00:36:13,752
Miss Christine.

415
00:36:14,641 --> 00:36:16,316
We’re no longer together.

416
00:36:17,286 --> 00:36:19,455
You broke my trust.

417
00:36:24,092 --> 00:36:26,993
I remember you telling me
that he had other priorities.

418
00:36:28,102 --> 00:36:30,470
So you knew he had a girlfriend.

419
00:36:30,698 --> 00:36:34,375
You knew he was taken,
so why did you continue the affair?

420
00:36:34,400 --> 00:36:39,024
Miss Christine, I made
a mistake, I’m sorry.

421
00:36:39,684 --> 00:36:41,144
Don’t worry.

422
00:36:41,902 --> 00:36:43,946
I’m a good person, Jasmine.

423
00:36:46,323 --> 00:36:48,337
I won’t fire you at work.

424
00:36:49,375 --> 00:36:51,377
But that’s about it.

425
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,737
Leave before I do something I’ll regret.

426
00:36:58,704 --> 00:37:00,426
I may have made a mistake,

427
00:37:01,552 --> 00:37:02,553
Tom and I,

428
00:37:03,379 --> 00:37:06,090
but you’re at fault too for
turning your back on him.

429
00:37:08,547 --> 00:37:09,664
You little–

430
00:37:13,618 --> 00:37:15,985
Didn’t you say that you
didn’t have a boyfriend?

431
00:37:16,387 --> 00:37:17,790
That you’ve let go?

432
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:21,884
That it’s better to just focus on Prima

433
00:37:21,909 --> 00:37:25,376
instead of focusing on the people that
could ruin your plans in life?

434
00:37:26,496 --> 00:37:28,749
Didn’t you say all that, Miss Christine?

435
00:37:30,361 --> 00:37:32,748
Now that I know that
you were referring to Tom,

436
00:37:33,727 --> 00:37:35,896
I felt sorry for him.

437
00:37:37,254 --> 00:37:39,924
I couldn’t imagine how he could have felt.

438
00:37:41,305 --> 00:37:43,998
You have no idea about
what’s really happening.

439
00:37:45,789 --> 00:37:47,040
And so does Tom.

440
00:38:56,534 --> 00:38:59,940
If you’re looking for
Christine, she’s in Room 402.

441
00:38:59,983 --> 00:39:02,823
And I think she was
having fun with someone.

442
00:39:02,987 --> 00:39:04,675
If you know what I mean.

443
00:39:05,860 --> 00:39:07,111
I really love you.

444
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:08,721
- You motherfucker!
- Tom!

445
00:39:11,080 --> 00:39:12,299
You mother-fucker!

446
00:39:12,324 --> 00:39:13,573
Let me explain.

447
00:39:13,616 --> 00:39:15,573
He’s your fucking stepson.

448
00:39:15,703 --> 00:39:17,673
No, I’m so sorry.

449
00:39:18,252 --> 00:39:20,941
We may have started off badly, but

450
00:39:20,941 --> 00:39:23,778
I know that what I feel for you is right.

451
00:39:24,596 --> 00:39:28,199
Tickets for tomorrow's concert as well as
the dinner reservation I have with Jasmine.

452
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:29,450
- Okay, sir.
- Thank you.

453
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:30,551
- Come on?
- Let’s go!

454
00:39:30,576 --> 00:39:32,953
Tell me where my daughter is.

455
00:39:32,953 --> 00:39:36,207
You wait, unless you
want to meet her in hell.

456
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:37,877
You might as well bring Tom, too.

457
00:39:38,801 --> 00:39:39,802
No!

458
00:39:43,339 --> 00:39:45,216
I saw these in Ryan’s stuff.

459
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:47,093
That’s your private
investigator’s notebook.

460
00:39:47,093 --> 00:39:49,970
He’s the one who told me
that Jasmine is your daughter.

461
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:55,088
Jasmine.
