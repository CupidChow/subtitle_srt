1
00:00:00,041 --> 00:00:02,752
Oh my, it’s Miss Christine Soriano.

2
00:00:02,843 --> 00:00:04,970
Thank you, Marie. I love you.

3
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:07,039
It’s good that you’re
continuing with your studies.

4
00:00:07,257 --> 00:00:10,093
Well, it’s because Miss
Christine Soriano said that–

5
00:00:10,252 --> 00:00:13,297
"Education is one of the things
we shouldn’t be ashamed of."

6
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:18,643
So, after I graduate, I’ll
make sure to work for Prima.

7
00:00:18,668 --> 00:00:20,378
I just want you to be my wife.

8
00:00:20,403 --> 00:00:23,976
You’re younger than me. You’re my employee.
I’m your boss.

9
00:00:24,001 --> 00:00:28,210
I’m ready to face what other
people would say about us.

10
00:00:29,195 --> 00:00:30,488
May I know your name?

11
00:00:30,488 --> 00:00:32,073
Can I book a room with you?

12
00:00:32,098 --> 00:00:33,099
Yeah, sure.

13
00:00:33,337 --> 00:00:35,172
I just wanted to avoid
the noise downstairs.

14
00:00:35,296 --> 00:00:37,595
I would have brought my reviewer with me.

15
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:38,726
You’re studying?

16
00:00:38,751 --> 00:00:41,629
Is it your first time seeing
a studying sex worker?

17
00:00:42,539 --> 00:00:44,291
I love you so much, Christine.

18
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:47,445
I will continue loving you,
whatever your decision will be.

19
00:00:49,636 --> 00:00:50,762
Miss?

20
00:02:54,483 --> 00:02:56,110
I’m really sorry, miss.

21
00:02:56,662 --> 00:02:57,739
Jasmine.

22
00:02:57,764 --> 00:02:59,307
Jasmine, sorry.

23
00:02:59,716 --> 00:03:01,784
Who would’ve thought that
we’d see each other again?

24
00:03:02,371 --> 00:03:03,915
Well, at least not in a bar.

25
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:06,522
Well, you did say that we
won’t see each other again,

26
00:03:06,547 --> 00:03:08,006
but here we are.

27
00:03:08,247 --> 00:03:10,499
It’s like the universe
wants us to meet again.

28
00:03:11,094 --> 00:03:13,179
Wow, was that a pick up line?

29
00:03:13,646 --> 00:03:14,939
You have a girlfriend, right?

30
00:03:16,083 --> 00:03:17,459
Typical.

31
00:03:17,569 --> 00:03:20,489
I’m just saying, I don’t think
there’s anything wrong with that.

32
00:03:20,885 --> 00:03:22,636
So you actually believe in destiny?

33
00:03:23,498 --> 00:03:24,518
In the universe?

34
00:03:25,639 --> 00:03:26,678
Yes.

35
00:03:27,705 --> 00:03:29,475
You’re actually a romantic guy.

36
00:03:29,500 --> 00:03:30,927
Is that how it is?

37
00:03:30,952 --> 00:03:31,794
Of course.

38
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:33,342
Jasmine.

39
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:35,159
Jasmine, look, your video went viral.

40
00:03:36,163 --> 00:03:37,253
Check out the comments.

41
00:03:37,473 --> 00:03:38,850
They’re asking if you’re a model.

42
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:40,595
You’re right.

43
00:03:42,725 --> 00:03:43,910
Don’t you look hot here?

44
00:03:43,935 --> 00:03:46,108
Oh my god, Sis!

45
00:03:46,308 --> 00:03:47,810
Look at this girl.

46
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:49,702
She’s not only pretty

47
00:03:50,063 --> 00:03:51,356
but hardworking too.

48
00:03:51,674 --> 00:03:53,801
A lot have been asking
if she’s actually a model.

49
00:03:56,358 --> 00:03:57,476
You’re right.

50
00:03:57,927 --> 00:03:59,053
She is pretty.

51
00:04:00,147 --> 00:04:01,185
Oh!

52
00:04:01,246 --> 00:04:03,206
She can be the model for the perfume line,

53
00:04:03,231 --> 00:04:05,734
because it’s all about
women's desire, right?

54
00:04:06,108 --> 00:04:07,570
- Yeah.
- And you can tell that

55
00:04:07,570 --> 00:04:09,703
she’s willing to work and learn.

56
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,396
She just might be the next

57
00:04:11,516 --> 00:04:13,977
famous figure like
Badjao Girl or Carrot Man.

58
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:17,398
- I’m sorry ma’am, but you really can’t–
- Ma, come on!

59
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:18,174
No, it’s okay.

60
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:18,991
Christine, I’m sorry.

61
00:04:19,578 --> 00:04:20,704
I tried to stop her.

62
00:04:22,191 --> 00:04:23,317
Hello, Christine.

63
00:04:24,050 --> 00:04:27,595
You can’t just barge into my
office without an appointment.

64
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,749
You can’t just do whatever you want.

65
00:04:31,674 --> 00:04:35,428
You need to respect the
positions we have in this company.

66
00:04:37,612 --> 00:04:39,989
Weren’t you the first one
who meddled with our lives?

67
00:04:41,379 --> 00:04:44,966
So you don’t get to choose what kind of
treatment I wanna give you.

68
00:04:46,707 --> 00:04:49,668
I heard that you were going
to phase out the Stella Powder.

69
00:04:50,128 --> 00:04:51,880
You can’t do that, that’s my product.

70
00:04:52,646 --> 00:04:54,356
That was your product.

71
00:04:55,427 --> 00:04:56,595
It wasn’t selling.

72
00:04:57,496 --> 00:04:59,665
It needs to be reformulated and changed.

73
00:05:00,381 --> 00:05:01,404
Sorry,

74
00:05:01,798 --> 00:05:02,841
it’s just business.

75
00:05:04,991 --> 00:05:06,044
Well.

76
00:05:06,912 --> 00:05:08,417
I have news for you.

77
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:09,885
And it’s bad.

78
00:05:12,064 --> 00:05:14,108
Your days in this office are numbered.

79
00:05:14,826 --> 00:05:17,454
I already know about
your secrets and your lies.

80
00:05:18,108 --> 00:05:19,196
So, if I were you,

81
00:05:19,498 --> 00:05:20,749
I’d pack up.

82
00:05:21,393 --> 00:05:24,897
Leave quietly. If you
don’t want any scandals.

83
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:33,621
Christine, honestly.

84
00:05:34,643 --> 00:05:36,223
I don’t know what’s going on.

85
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:39,573
But you have an option–

86
00:05:40,624 --> 00:05:42,292
Not to lose this company.

87
00:05:44,040 --> 00:05:45,197
I’ll take care of you

88
00:05:46,006 --> 00:05:47,299
if you choose me.

89
00:05:57,041 --> 00:05:58,094
Oh my god.

90
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:00,894
Are those two satan's offspring?

91
00:06:10,268 --> 00:06:11,315
Hi, Jasmine.

92
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:13,634
- This is my girlfriend, Ericka.
- Hey, hi!

93
00:06:13,664 --> 00:06:14,749
- Nice to meet you.
- I’ll go ahead.

94
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:15,416
Come on, let’s dance.

95
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,425
Sure, let’s go.

96
00:06:16,793 --> 00:06:18,643
Finally we’ve met!

97
00:06:22,987 --> 00:06:24,005
Well, bro?

98
00:06:24,930 --> 00:06:26,473
You look lonely.

99
00:06:27,206 --> 00:06:28,282
Are you lonely?

100
00:06:48,503 --> 00:06:51,006
Wow! You’re so sexy.

101
00:06:51,031 --> 00:06:52,240
- Hey! You bastard!
- Bastard!

102
00:06:52,494 --> 00:06:53,870
- You bastard!
- You’re so dramatic–

103
00:06:53,895 --> 00:06:54,872
Are you okay, Jasmine?

104
00:06:54,897 --> 00:06:56,024
You son of a bitch!

105
00:07:00,128 --> 00:07:01,129
Are you okay?

106
00:07:01,129 --> 00:07:01,754
Babe!

107
00:07:01,754 --> 00:07:02,547
Are you okay?

108
00:07:02,572 --> 00:07:03,281
Yeah.

109
00:07:04,215 --> 00:07:05,049
That sick bastard!

110
00:07:05,049 --> 00:07:06,050
That bastard!

111
00:07:06,994 --> 00:07:09,079
You didn’t have to interfere.

112
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:12,100
I could’ve handled it myself.

113
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:17,432
I saw the guy harassing you, so of course,
I wouldn’t just let him be.

114
00:07:21,328 --> 00:07:22,954
I’m okay with it.

115
00:07:23,380 --> 00:07:26,216
I was just surprised by what happened.

116
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:30,901
I’ll be able to move on eventually.

117
00:07:33,906 --> 00:07:35,116
I’m used to it.

118
00:07:35,477 --> 00:07:37,386
No woman is used to being harassed.

119
00:07:38,353 --> 00:07:41,147
Yes, there is. Me, remember?

120
00:07:41,444 --> 00:07:42,945
I’m being paid to have sex.

121
00:07:43,554 --> 00:07:45,222
Do you like what you’re doing?

122
00:07:52,322 --> 00:07:53,490
Can I book you for a night?

123
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,601
Huh?

124
00:07:56,491 --> 00:07:58,034
I’ll pay you for one night.

125
00:07:58,803 --> 00:08:01,190
Nothing will happen, we’ll just talk.

126
00:08:31,063 --> 00:08:32,269
Feels so good.

127
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:35,472
- Say it louder.
- It feels so good, keep going.

128
00:08:35,597 --> 00:08:36,723
So good.

129
00:08:37,271 --> 00:08:38,647
Tell me–

130
00:08:38,819 --> 00:08:41,155
Tell me my dick is big.

131
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:43,254
Your dick is big.

132
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:44,864
Say it again.

133
00:08:44,889 --> 00:08:45,931
Your dick is big.

134
00:08:45,956 --> 00:08:47,458
Again.

135
00:08:48,326 --> 00:08:50,411
- Keep going.
- Your dick is–

136
00:08:50,436 --> 00:08:52,421
Your dick is huge.

137
00:08:52,736 --> 00:08:54,280
You’re making me cum.

138
00:08:54,305 --> 00:08:56,223
Your dick is huge.

139
00:08:58,579 --> 00:08:59,789
Say it again.

140
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,316
- So good.
- Keep going.

141
00:09:01,341 --> 00:09:03,135
Feels so good.

142
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:08,130
So, long story short, my
proposal was rejected.

143
00:09:08,295 --> 00:09:12,549
That’s why I’m here,
for “healing” like they say.

144
00:09:12,684 --> 00:09:14,894
That’s because you keep acting like a hero.

145
00:09:16,401 --> 00:09:19,279
So are we just going to talk again?

146
00:09:20,296 --> 00:09:21,839
Why? Do you have to study?

147
00:09:22,032 --> 00:09:23,842
I don’t think there’s
any phone signal here.

148
00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:26,619
Not anymore. I just graduated.

149
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:28,058
Finally.

150
00:09:28,472 --> 00:09:29,515
It was just yesterday.

151
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,043
Congrats!

152
00:09:31,255 --> 00:09:34,258
So, it's your turn now.
I have a lot to ask.

153
00:09:34,516 --> 00:09:36,643
What do you wanna know about my life?

154
00:09:36,783 --> 00:09:38,410
How did I become a prostitute?

155
00:09:39,161 --> 00:09:42,498
So you’re not just a boxer,
you’re a psychic, too?

156
00:09:42,966 --> 00:09:44,133
Silly.

157
00:09:44,823 --> 00:09:48,077
I don’t even know who
I am, where I am from.

158
00:09:50,370 --> 00:09:53,373
I didn’t get a chance
to meet my relatives and

159
00:09:54,010 --> 00:09:56,605
I can’t even remember my parents.

160
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,105
Can’t you remember at least one of them?

161
00:10:01,454 --> 00:10:02,956
Not even one.

162
00:10:03,448 --> 00:10:06,801
I can only remember my grandmother who died
because of an accident.

163
00:10:13,516 --> 00:10:15,101
Oh my dear, what’s wrong?

164
00:10:35,217 --> 00:10:38,988
Grandma Fely!

165
00:10:40,071 --> 00:10:44,033
Grandma Fely!

166
00:10:45,353 --> 00:10:50,107
Grandma Fely!

167
00:10:55,839 --> 00:10:59,012
Grandma Fely!

168
00:11:05,081 --> 00:11:10,410
So long story short, I became homeless
when I was eight years old.

169
00:11:17,511 --> 00:11:19,096
Someone adopted me, though.

170
00:11:19,253 --> 00:11:22,777
Took care of me and
gave me food and clothing.

171
00:11:23,032 --> 00:11:25,201
Hey kid, where are you from?

172
00:11:26,103 --> 00:11:27,855
I don’t know,

173
00:11:28,022 --> 00:11:30,316
I’m lost.

174
00:11:31,061 --> 00:11:33,332
Oh no, you poor child.

175
00:11:33,556 --> 00:11:35,480
Where’s your mom?

176
00:11:36,379 --> 00:11:39,073
I don’t know.

177
00:11:39,073 --> 00:11:43,452
Grandma Fely was run over by a car.

178
00:11:45,143 --> 00:11:48,761
Oh my gosh. What’s your name?

179
00:11:49,807 --> 00:11:51,434
Lara.

180
00:11:51,838 --> 00:11:52,839
Lara?

181
00:11:53,954 --> 00:11:57,456
Starting today, your name will be Jasmine.

182
00:11:58,423 --> 00:11:59,591
Are you hungry?

183
00:12:00,161 --> 00:12:01,705
Yes.

184
00:12:01,949 --> 00:12:05,912
Let’s eat first and then I’ll
help you look for your mom.

185
00:12:06,229 --> 00:12:08,315
- Hmm?
- Okay.

186
00:12:12,488 --> 00:12:15,136
But her kindness comes with a price.

187
00:12:28,919 --> 00:12:31,004
Hey, prepare me some coffee.

188
00:12:31,525 --> 00:12:34,228
Why do you keep drawing, you’re
not gonna learn anything from that.

189
00:12:34,438 --> 00:12:36,106
I shouldn’t have let you go to school.

190
00:12:36,495 --> 00:12:38,504
I work as prostitute so
that I can pay for rent,

191
00:12:38,529 --> 00:12:40,740
so we could eat and so
that you can go to school.

192
00:12:40,983 --> 00:12:42,443
And this is all you do?

193
00:12:45,052 --> 00:12:50,557
Aunty, this is my math assignment.

194
00:12:50,582 --> 00:12:53,794
How dare you answer back at me?

195
00:12:54,010 --> 00:12:58,723
Hey you little brat, know your place.
Look at your siblings.

196
00:12:59,333 --> 00:13:00,376
They’re obedient.

197
00:13:02,468 --> 00:13:03,506
Wash that.

198
00:13:04,055 --> 00:13:05,223
It stinks already.

199
00:13:09,506 --> 00:13:12,134
It’s hard to find someone who’s truly kind.

200
00:13:12,927 --> 00:13:14,596
Everything has a price.

201
00:13:16,576 --> 00:13:19,663
She brought me into the
club where I’m working at now.

202
00:13:20,426 --> 00:13:21,801
Once you’re at the table,

203
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:25,109
order a lot of iced tea so that
we get a lot of commissions.

204
00:13:26,576 --> 00:13:31,247
I fed you. I provided all your needs.
It’s about time you help me!

205
00:13:31,492 --> 00:13:33,160
Nothing’s for free in this world, girl.

206
00:13:35,621 --> 00:13:39,625
If you do good, I’ll vouch
for you to the manager.

207
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:42,297
I’ll give you a lot of commissions.

208
00:13:43,106 --> 00:13:46,750
For your tuition fee. You want
to continue studying, right?

209
00:13:48,366 --> 00:13:49,385
Let’s go.

210
00:13:49,410 --> 00:13:52,621
Come on, stop being so dramatic.

211
00:13:55,454 --> 00:13:57,456
Aren’t you looking for your parents?

212
00:13:57,963 --> 00:13:59,090
Your mother?

213
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,133
Have you tried going back to
where the accident happened?

214
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:05,883
Maybe your mother’s looking for you.

215
00:14:06,224 --> 00:14:09,734
A mother would always look for their child.

216
00:14:11,315 --> 00:14:13,304
That’s only if she loves her child.

217
00:14:15,002 --> 00:14:16,378
What if she doesn’t?

218
00:14:16,764 --> 00:14:18,349
Would she still be searching?

219
00:14:19,485 --> 00:14:21,112
Are you sure this is the place?

220
00:14:21,553 --> 00:14:24,597
Yeah. This is where
Grandma Fely got hit by the car.

221
00:14:25,573 --> 00:14:27,449
- I wish I was run over by a car too.
- Hey.

222
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:31,662
If I lived with her, then
maybe I didn’t have to–

223
00:14:31,996 --> 00:14:33,570
Come on, Jasmine.

224
00:14:33,789 --> 00:14:37,126
You’ve gone through a lot,
that’s why you’re stronger now.

225
00:14:37,589 --> 00:14:40,175
See, you were able to
graduate without anyone’s help.

226
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:43,173
Besides, maybe your mom
is still searching for you,

227
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:45,117
it’s just that it’s not yet time for
both of you to find each other.

228
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,561
If she really looked for me, then
she should have found me already.

229
00:14:53,555 --> 00:14:54,723
But she hasn’t,

230
00:14:55,350 --> 00:14:56,935
so why should I look for her?

231
00:15:00,487 --> 00:15:04,574
Besides, I’m okay now. It’s done.

232
00:15:05,318 --> 00:15:07,237
I’ve graduated.

233
00:15:07,721 --> 00:15:09,264
I’m free.

234
00:15:10,599 --> 00:15:12,768
And this is gonna be my last job.

235
00:15:15,487 --> 00:15:17,030
I’m so impressed by your strength.

236
00:15:17,794 --> 00:15:19,337
We just spoke with each other today.

237
00:15:19,376 --> 00:15:21,003
Well, twice.

238
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:22,241
But you know,

239
00:15:23,281 --> 00:15:25,950
I’m interested to know your story.

240
00:15:27,118 --> 00:15:28,578
I’m sleepy.

241
00:15:31,158 --> 00:15:32,914
Come on, let’s sleep.

242
00:16:28,752 --> 00:16:32,106
I’m sure this would
really suit you, my dear.

243
00:16:46,243 --> 00:16:47,328
Goodnight.

244
00:16:47,723 --> 00:16:48,724
Goodnight.

245
00:17:21,888 --> 00:17:26,851
Hello, Marcus? Any news with
that prostitute they were saying?

246
00:17:28,022 --> 00:17:29,339
I’m still tracing her.

247
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:33,442
They couldn’t give me a last name
so the search is quite difficult.

248
00:17:34,295 --> 00:17:35,778
All they know is the name “Annie.”

249
00:17:36,995 --> 00:17:39,831
But they said she’s the one
who’s picking up stray kids

250
00:17:39,856 --> 00:17:41,817
and selling them to some pimp.

251
00:17:41,945 --> 00:17:43,021
Okay then.

252
00:17:43,308 --> 00:17:45,143
Please keep me updated.

253
00:17:46,362 --> 00:17:48,114
Thank you, Marcus.

254
00:18:04,775 --> 00:18:05,834
Ching.

255
00:18:06,256 --> 00:18:08,675
Can you really just leave your child?

256
00:18:08,700 --> 00:18:12,809
Mama? Where are you going?

257
00:18:18,970 --> 00:18:21,890
Why are you leaving?

258
00:18:25,906 --> 00:18:27,434
I’ll come back, my dear.

259
00:18:29,081 --> 00:18:31,114
Take me with you.

260
00:18:33,523 --> 00:18:35,442
I’ll come back, my dear.

261
00:18:35,733 --> 00:18:38,277
I wanna go with you.

262
00:18:44,388 --> 00:18:48,976
Lara, my dear. Don’t be stubborn, okay?

263
00:18:50,029 --> 00:18:52,699
You’ll stay with your Grandma Fely.

264
00:18:52,894 --> 00:18:57,270
Aunt Fely. Please take care of my daughter.

265
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,502
I’ll be sending you money.

266
00:19:03,952 --> 00:19:04,995
Ching.

267
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:09,924
A child should always
be by their mother’s side.

268
00:19:11,294 --> 00:19:14,207
Please don’t do this to your daughter.

269
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:27,256
My dear. Be good, all right?

270
00:19:28,121 --> 00:19:31,917
Never forget that mama is so proud of you.

271
00:19:33,009 --> 00:19:35,971
Mama just really needs to do this.

272
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,205
She needs to leave.

273
00:19:40,457 --> 00:19:43,252
When you grow up, you’ll understand.

274
00:19:45,293 --> 00:19:47,420
I love you so much, my dear.

275
00:19:52,266 --> 00:19:54,707
I’ll leave my daughter to you.

276
00:19:56,251 --> 00:19:59,213
Take good care of yourself.

277
00:20:34,805 --> 00:20:36,015
Aunt Fely?

278
00:20:36,706 --> 00:20:37,756
Lara.

279
00:20:37,781 --> 00:20:39,657
- Mama!
- My dear!

280
00:20:41,487 --> 00:20:44,490
Aunt Fely, you can’t be here.

281
00:20:44,633 --> 00:20:47,504
What happened to your face again, Ching?

282
00:20:48,700 --> 00:20:49,743
Christine?

283
00:20:50,432 --> 00:20:51,469
Christine!

284
00:20:51,494 --> 00:20:52,120
Aunty.

285
00:20:52,404 --> 00:20:55,115
Mama, look at my drawing.

286
00:20:55,861 --> 00:20:57,612
That’s nice, dear.

287
00:20:59,327 --> 00:21:03,785
Let Aunt Fely keep it for the meantime
and when I get to visit,

288
00:21:03,973 --> 00:21:05,558
I’ll look at all of it.

289
00:21:06,731 --> 00:21:08,149
Okay? I’m sorry, dear.

290
00:21:08,863 --> 00:21:10,198
Ma.

291
00:21:10,488 --> 00:21:11,520
- Sorry,
- Mama.

292
00:21:11,536 --> 00:21:14,003
mama will visit next time. I’m sorry.

293
00:21:14,028 --> 00:21:15,154
Christine!

294
00:21:15,286 --> 00:21:17,301
Mama.

295
00:21:17,813 --> 00:21:21,358
- Aunty, please take care of Lara.
- Mama.

296
00:21:21,782 --> 00:21:23,575
Please take care of my daughter, Aunty.

297
00:21:24,174 --> 00:21:25,864
Ching, take care of yourself.

298
00:21:25,889 --> 00:21:28,057
I’m sorry, wait for mama.

299
00:21:28,129 --> 00:21:29,167
Mama.

300
00:21:29,303 --> 00:21:30,679
Let’s go.

301
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,624
- Come on. Let’s go.
- I’ll visit you, my dear.

302
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:33,583
- Mama, mama!

303
00:21:33,608 --> 00:21:35,192
I’m sorry.

304
00:21:35,468 --> 00:21:37,053
Let’s go.

305
00:21:37,468 --> 00:21:40,095
- Ching, take care of yourself.
- Mama! Mama!

306
00:21:41,989 --> 00:21:43,023
I’m sorry.

307
00:21:44,441 --> 00:21:45,457
There, there, child.

308
00:21:45,829 --> 00:21:48,039
Ching, be careful.

309
00:21:49,237 --> 00:21:51,490
- Come now. Don’t cry.
- Mama, mama.

310
00:21:51,735 --> 00:21:53,069
Christine!

311
00:22:11,887 --> 00:22:12,971
Christine!

312
00:22:15,094 --> 00:22:16,095
What were you doing?

313
00:22:16,785 --> 00:22:18,454
I was just looking at something outside.

314
00:22:18,479 --> 00:22:19,512
What were you doing?

315
00:22:20,527 --> 00:22:22,024
I was just looking at something out–

316
00:22:22,049 --> 00:22:23,925
You think I didn’t see what you were doing?

317
00:22:23,950 --> 00:22:25,414
- Benito, you’re hurting me.
- Huh?

318
00:22:28,218 --> 00:22:29,678
You think I’m stupid?

319
00:22:30,444 --> 00:22:34,281
I told you, you should only focus on me.

320
00:22:34,623 --> 00:22:36,458
Why did you let them come here?

321
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:37,856
I didn’t tell them to come–

322
00:22:38,106 --> 00:22:39,483
Don’t answer back!

323
00:22:39,981 --> 00:22:41,232
Stop answering back at me.

324
00:22:42,285 --> 00:22:45,413
The money you’re sending should be enough.

325
00:22:45,762 --> 00:22:46,799
Got it?

326
00:22:47,382 --> 00:22:51,052
Ever since you got
married to me, you’re mine.

327
00:22:51,984 --> 00:22:56,363
All mine. You don’t have any other family.

328
00:22:56,903 --> 00:22:58,488
You’re mine!

329
00:23:18,287 --> 00:23:19,346
Please don’t.

330
00:23:19,371 --> 00:23:20,457
Don’t cry.

331
00:23:20,482 --> 00:23:21,525
Don’t.

332
00:23:21,525 --> 00:23:23,176
Don’t cry, come on.

333
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:25,244
- Please don’t!
- Come on.

334
00:23:25,269 --> 00:23:26,312
Don’t!

335
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:27,630
- Don’t.
- Come on.

336
00:23:27,655 --> 00:23:28,906
Come on.

337
00:23:32,968 --> 00:23:34,219
Don’t cry.

338
00:23:35,773 --> 00:23:37,358
- Don’t.
- Come on.

339
00:24:06,590 --> 00:24:07,608
Jasmine?

340
00:24:07,633 --> 00:24:09,218
Jasmine? Jasmine!

341
00:24:09,345 --> 00:24:11,473
Hey, Jasmine.

342
00:24:11,498 --> 00:24:14,584
Hey, what are you doing?

343
00:24:15,218 --> 00:24:17,471
- I can’t take it anymore, Marie.
- Hey, Jasmine.

344
00:24:17,893 --> 00:24:20,442
I feel so dirty.

345
00:24:21,768 --> 00:24:23,311
You can do this, you can do this.

346
00:24:23,336 --> 00:24:24,671
I’m right here with you, okay?

347
00:24:26,023 --> 00:24:28,943
Help, help!

348
00:25:27,984 --> 00:25:31,571
The number you dialed is not in service.

349
00:27:28,055 --> 00:27:29,223
Let’s have breakfast.

350
00:27:29,953 --> 00:27:31,037
Come on.

351
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:37,259
Hello, Sephy.

352
00:27:37,824 --> 00:27:40,493
Do you remember that girl who went viral?

353
00:27:40,518 --> 00:27:42,270
Yes, of course.

354
00:28:06,877 --> 00:28:08,010
I’m putting it in.

355
00:28:08,370 --> 00:28:09,633
I’m putting it in.

356
00:28:09,658 --> 00:28:10,677
The condom.

357
00:28:10,702 --> 00:28:12,081
- No need, it’s hard already.
- Get the co–

358
00:28:12,106 --> 00:28:13,024
Get the condom.

359
00:28:13,024 --> 00:28:13,942
I’m putting it in.

360
00:28:13,942 --> 00:28:15,276
- Get the condom.
- Let’s just go for it.

361
00:28:15,301 --> 00:28:17,253
Fuck, I said get the condom.

362
00:28:17,783 --> 00:28:18,822
Bitch–

363
00:28:19,114 --> 00:28:20,490
This wasn’t in our arrangement.

364
00:28:20,623 --> 00:28:22,000
No, wait, let’s just do this.

365
00:28:22,284 --> 00:28:24,077
You’ll agree to this, right?

366
00:28:24,319 --> 00:28:25,279
I’ll pay you more.

367
00:28:25,405 --> 00:28:26,432
I’ll give you a tip.

368
00:28:26,457 --> 00:28:27,288
Come on, let’s–

369
00:28:27,313 --> 00:28:28,620
You stupid bastard.

370
00:28:28,665 --> 00:28:30,917
Do you think that would
be enough if I get pregnant?

371
00:28:32,252 --> 00:28:33,753
- Bitch. You’re just a prostitute.

372
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:34,879
- Why are you complaining?
- You idiot.

373
00:28:34,979 --> 00:28:36,523
Wow,  you’re so proud even
with that little dick of yours.

374
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:38,174
It’s like the size of my pinky finger.

375
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:38,925
What is that?

376
00:28:38,925 --> 00:28:39,968
- I won’t allow it.
- What is that? You fucker.

377
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:40,761
- No matter what you say,
- Fuck you.

378
00:28:40,761 --> 00:28:42,446
- I still won’t allow it, bitch.
- Where's my cellphone?

379
00:28:42,470 --> 00:28:44,472
- I already paid you.
- I don’t care, I’ll take a video of you.

380
00:28:44,472 --> 00:28:45,765
Look at this bastard’s tiny dick.

381
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:46,741
Tiny.

382
00:28:46,766 --> 00:28:48,101
- Stop it.
- Get out.

383
00:28:48,143 --> 00:28:48,810
Tiny.

384
00:28:48,810 --> 00:28:50,478
- Bitch.
- Tiny dick. Look at it, it’s fucking tiny.

385
00:28:50,478 --> 00:28:52,230
- What is that, a chili?
- You bitch.

386
00:28:52,882 --> 00:28:54,592
Good morning.

387
00:28:54,924 --> 00:28:57,302
You took so long. I ordered breakfast.

388
00:28:57,496 --> 00:29:00,003
Thank you. I still had a client earlier.

389
00:29:04,137 --> 00:29:07,682
Shit. Prima sent me an email.

390
00:29:07,707 --> 00:29:08,721
Prima?

391
00:29:08,746 --> 00:29:09,556
Yes,

392
00:29:09,581 --> 00:29:11,416
- they saw my video that went viral.
- You mean Prima–

393
00:29:11,416 --> 00:29:12,959
The company of your idol?

394
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:14,978
- Yes, Christine Soriano.
- Jasmine.

395
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:15,336
Oh my god.

396
00:29:15,336 --> 00:29:16,671
Did you just say Prima?

397
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:17,380
Yeah.

398
00:29:17,380 --> 00:29:18,423
Prima?

399
00:29:18,448 --> 00:29:21,493
Uh, hello? We’re from Prima.

400
00:29:21,518 --> 00:29:22,527
Really?

401
00:29:22,552 --> 00:29:25,054
Yeah, Anton and I are from the Marketing
and Promo department.

402
00:29:25,675 --> 00:29:28,303
I think they're looking
for our replacement.

403
00:29:28,736 --> 00:29:32,197
Bro, I think they’re looking
for your replacement.

404
00:29:33,771 --> 00:29:37,900
Come on, they’re looking
for the new face of Prima.

405
00:29:38,096 --> 00:29:40,370
And you might be who
they’re looking for, Jasmine.

406
00:29:40,395 --> 00:29:43,398
Many people thought you looked beautiful
in your viral video.

407
00:29:43,961 --> 00:29:45,838
Don’t forget about me
when you become famous.

408
00:29:45,863 --> 00:29:47,175
Don’t be silly.

409
00:29:47,694 --> 00:29:49,071
Don’t even dare.

410
00:29:49,096 --> 00:29:52,432
But I really can’t
believe it, I feel so lucky.

411
00:29:53,421 --> 00:29:56,048
Let’s practice how you’ll
answer when they interview you.

412
00:29:56,073 --> 00:29:57,776
- Yes, please, let’s do that.
- All right.

413
00:29:58,712 --> 00:30:02,091
Okay, so, their first question would be:

414
00:30:03,441 --> 00:30:06,861
Where do you see yourself
in this company in five years?

415
00:30:07,409 --> 00:30:10,667
That’s so serious. Can she answer with,
as long as Prima wants her?

416
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:17,312
The second question might be about what
would be your contributions to the company.

417
00:30:18,526 --> 00:30:19,645
You have a point.

418
00:30:24,984 --> 00:30:27,236
Now I feel nervous.

419
00:30:30,908 --> 00:30:33,432
I think I can do this.

420
00:30:36,959 --> 00:30:39,253
The number you have reached is not in-

421
00:30:44,062 --> 00:30:48,358
Jasmine, it’s very important for you to see
your goals and dreams

422
00:30:48,528 --> 00:30:50,071
clearly in your mind.

423
00:30:52,070 --> 00:30:53,447
I can do that. I can do it.

424
00:30:53,780 --> 00:30:56,116
I’ll do anything just to reach my dreams.

425
00:30:56,414 --> 00:30:57,498
Am I right?

426
00:30:58,133 --> 00:31:00,928
Well, they’ve seen your viral video anyway.

427
00:31:00,953 --> 00:31:01,970
Hm-mmm.

428
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,789
Just don’t forget–

429
00:31:04,041 --> 00:31:07,753
Prima, they’ll want to see
that you are quite fashionable.

430
00:31:08,214 --> 00:31:09,632
- And stylish.
- That’ll be easy.

431
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,571
You should look pleasant.

432
00:31:14,092 --> 00:31:17,054
You should show them that
you’re an asset to the company.

433
00:31:17,482 --> 00:31:19,525
Very presentable.

434
00:31:19,661 --> 00:31:22,057
I think the reason they
like you is because it’s good

435
00:31:22,082 --> 00:31:24,440
publicity seeing you
studying in that viral video.

436
00:31:24,465 --> 00:31:26,092
It’s quite inspirational.

437
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:28,911
That’s what Christine Soriano likes.

438
00:31:29,506 --> 00:31:32,050
Whenever you see the brand,

439
00:31:32,544 --> 00:31:34,045
you’re reminded of success.

440
00:31:34,651 --> 00:31:35,716
Beauty.

441
00:31:36,143 --> 00:31:37,686
And hard work, of course.

442
00:31:37,966 --> 00:31:39,676
Which I believe you already have.

443
00:31:40,143 --> 00:31:41,150
Of course.

444
00:31:44,941 --> 00:31:49,495
Also, Prima gives very high salaries

445
00:31:49,582 --> 00:31:51,751
to their talents and endorsers, right?

446
00:31:51,776 --> 00:31:53,069
That’s great.

447
00:32:01,464 --> 00:32:03,507
Oh, you’re doing your makeup?

448
00:32:03,969 --> 00:32:05,345
As usual.

449
00:32:07,925 --> 00:32:10,303
Do you think you’re lucky because of Tom?

450
00:32:11,924 --> 00:32:13,045
Hmm,

451
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:17,263
I’m so close to believing in luck.

452
00:32:17,901 --> 00:32:19,570
Believing in the universe.

453
00:32:20,242 --> 00:32:21,368
But too bad.

454
00:32:21,808 --> 00:32:23,226
He has a girlfriend, right?

455
00:32:24,609 --> 00:32:28,905
But if no one knows,
no one gets hurt, right?

456
00:32:30,066 --> 00:32:32,819
You know, you’re so mean.

457
00:32:33,006 --> 00:32:35,166
How dare you, you’re meaner than me.

458
00:32:36,850 --> 00:32:40,228
But hey, I like him for you.

459
00:32:40,596 --> 00:32:43,682
Look at how he gets to you,
you’re even wearing lipstick.

460
00:32:43,707 --> 00:32:45,500
- Even curling your hair.
- Come on.

461
00:32:45,525 --> 00:32:47,698
- That’s not true, well maybe a little.
- Jeez.

462
00:32:50,280 --> 00:32:51,364
But you know,

463
00:32:51,823 --> 00:32:54,493
if it’s luck that’s following you around,

464
00:32:56,087 --> 00:32:58,214
That just means that it’s all meant to be.

465
00:32:58,766 --> 00:32:59,850
You’re right.

466
00:33:00,854 --> 00:33:02,272
You’re meeting someone.

467
00:33:02,420 --> 00:33:03,502
Ah.

468
00:33:04,695 --> 00:33:08,115
Okay then, I’m meeting
this foreigner I met outside.

469
00:33:08,488 --> 00:33:10,740
- Bye,  good luck with your date.
- Bye.

470
00:33:10,765 --> 00:33:11,806
Bye.

471
00:33:23,686 --> 00:33:26,188
I’ll get into Prima.

472
00:33:27,616 --> 00:33:30,369
I’ll finally meet Miss Christine Soriano.

473
00:33:49,193 --> 00:33:52,030
The number you have
reached is not in service

474
00:33:52,030 --> 00:33:54,383
at this time and there is no new number

475
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:56,948
please be sure you have che-

476
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:27,499
Oh?

477
00:34:30,732 --> 00:34:32,359
What are you doing here?

478
00:34:33,441 --> 00:34:36,215
Ahh, I have an idea.

479
00:34:36,573 --> 00:34:39,574
Wait, you’re making me feel nervous.

480
00:34:44,637 --> 00:34:47,717
- Wow, I’m very impressed.
- Tada!

481
00:34:47,874 --> 00:34:49,996
I feel like you’re the one courting me.

482
00:34:50,167 --> 00:34:52,545
Why? Are guys the only
ones allowed to court?

483
00:34:53,377 --> 00:34:54,754
No, just kidding.

484
00:34:55,582 --> 00:34:57,731
I just want to express my gratitude.

485
00:34:58,411 --> 00:35:03,290
So here you go, everything you
gave me last night, I spent it for this.

486
00:35:05,186 --> 00:35:06,903
We should drink that, okay?

487
00:35:07,279 --> 00:35:09,073
I spent a fortune on it.

488
00:35:09,106 --> 00:35:10,809
You have nothing to worry about.

489
00:35:12,582 --> 00:35:13,791
Thank you.

490
00:35:19,492 --> 00:35:23,911
And, I’m sorry. You got
into a fight because of me.

491
00:35:24,801 --> 00:35:27,429
Oh yeah my face still feels sore.

492
00:35:28,029 --> 00:35:30,657
Maybe you should have
your girlfriend treat it.

493
00:35:33,668 --> 00:35:34,715
Sorry.

494
00:35:34,715 --> 00:35:36,114
It’s okay.

495
00:35:36,818 --> 00:35:38,569
Do you have a boyfriend?

496
00:35:38,594 --> 00:35:40,387
What boyfriend?

497
00:35:41,304 --> 00:35:43,432
I don’t think that’s meant for me.

498
00:35:46,584 --> 00:35:49,211
You’ve had no boyfriend since birth?

499
00:35:49,576 --> 00:35:51,578
Yeah, I swear.

500
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:55,027
I don’t have plans to have one yet.

501
00:35:55,027 --> 00:35:58,406
Besides, I wanted to be
able to finish college first.

502
00:35:59,456 --> 00:36:01,166
Thinking outside the box.

503
00:36:02,118 --> 00:36:04,220
I just didn’t want to
continue working in the club.

504
00:36:07,923 --> 00:36:10,192
You really love your girlfriend, don’t you?

505
00:36:11,718 --> 00:36:13,678
Would I propose if I don’t?

506
00:36:17,690 --> 00:36:19,692
What did you like about her?

507
00:36:22,677 --> 00:36:24,505
We’re both hardworking.

508
00:36:24,947 --> 00:36:28,993
Both of us can handle
whatever’s thrown at us.

509
00:36:31,606 --> 00:36:33,524
Except for your proposal.

510
00:36:34,364 --> 00:36:36,616
Just like what I said last night,

511
00:36:37,124 --> 00:36:38,501
it’s complicated.

512
00:36:38,891 --> 00:36:41,727
That doesn’t change the
fact that we love each other.

513
00:36:44,097 --> 00:36:48,351
All right then, if you
love your girlfriend–

514
00:36:49,892 --> 00:36:51,643
Then why are you here with me?

515
00:36:53,480 --> 00:36:54,637
And–

516
00:36:56,797 --> 00:37:00,343
why were you trying to kiss me earlier?

517
00:37:02,448 --> 00:37:03,658
Because I like you.

518
00:37:08,861 --> 00:37:11,196
I mean, who wouldn’t like you?

519
00:37:11,854 --> 00:37:13,189
Being with you is fun.

520
00:37:13,606 --> 00:37:14,700
Not much hang-ups?

521
00:37:14,725 --> 00:37:15,751
Exactly.

522
00:37:18,858 --> 00:37:20,067
Like the Earth is flat?

523
00:37:21,641 --> 00:37:24,227
Just kidding, don’t be too serious.

524
00:37:25,714 --> 00:37:30,343
The Earth is round,
sometimes we’re at the bottom.

525
00:37:31,248 --> 00:37:34,255
Eventually though, you’ll rise up.

526
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,336
Right?

527
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:41,801
Smart, witty, future face of Prima Beauty.

528
00:37:42,102 --> 00:37:45,481
I don’t know. Maybe I just needed
someone to distract me from my anxiety.

529
00:37:45,817 --> 00:37:47,682
I have a feeling that when I go back to
Manila,

530
00:37:47,682 --> 00:37:50,108
I wouldn’t have a girlfriend anymore.

531
00:37:50,132 --> 00:37:51,435
I don’t know.

532
00:37:53,896 --> 00:37:57,325
Your girlfriend is so lucky, you know?

533
00:37:59,474 --> 00:38:01,013
I envy her.

534
00:38:02,276 --> 00:38:06,013
I guess it would feel nice if someone’s
going crazy over of me.

535
00:38:09,453 --> 00:38:10,746
Come on, let’s eat.

536
00:38:11,168 --> 00:38:12,223
All right.

537
00:38:12,248 --> 00:38:13,666
The food’s cold now.

538
00:38:21,094 --> 00:38:23,325
You’re funny, you know?

539
00:38:23,928 --> 00:38:26,387
You’re not the type of guy
who breaks up with their partner

540
00:38:26,387 --> 00:38:28,787
when their proposal’s been rejected.

541
00:38:28,812 --> 00:38:31,317
I’m not that kind of jerk.

542
00:38:32,304 --> 00:38:33,872
Maybe just a little.

543
00:38:37,961 --> 00:38:42,302
So if you’re not sure
about your relationship

544
00:38:43,883 --> 00:38:45,968
does that mean that there’s a chance–

545
00:38:46,419 --> 00:38:48,021
that you guys aren’t together anymore?

546
00:38:50,423 --> 00:38:51,967
What’s your status then?

547
00:38:54,756 --> 00:38:55,840
I don’t know.

548
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:00,433
You know, Christine
Soriano said in her interview:

549
00:39:01,338 --> 00:39:03,825
When opportunity presents itself,

550
00:39:03,850 --> 00:39:04,977
grab it.

551
00:39:05,468 --> 00:39:09,317
Because you never know when
a chance would show itself aga–

552
00:42:38,758 --> 00:42:40,635
I love you, Christine.

553
00:43:35,320 --> 00:43:36,654
Have you fallen?

554
00:43:38,591 --> 00:43:41,261
Damn girl, that’s a first.

555
00:43:41,965 --> 00:43:43,774
There’s something about him.

556
00:43:43,998 --> 00:43:46,414
It’s like there’s a connection between us.

557
00:43:47,541 --> 00:43:48,602
Tom.

558
00:43:49,293 --> 00:43:52,016
I know that you’re still
hurt about what happened.

559
00:43:52,041 --> 00:43:53,668
And I understand.

560
00:43:53,990 --> 00:43:55,283
I love you.

561
00:43:55,424 --> 00:43:56,485
I love you, too.

562
00:43:56,610 --> 00:43:59,029
This is your chance to start anew.

563
00:43:59,730 --> 00:44:01,648
Just like what Miss
Christine said, grab it.

564
00:44:02,389 --> 00:44:05,059
A warm welcome to Prima
Beauty, Miss Jasmine.

565
00:44:05,059 --> 00:44:06,018
Thank you, ma’am.

566
00:44:06,018 --> 00:44:07,436
Thank you for taking this time.

567
00:44:07,461 --> 00:44:10,492
So how are you and your secret girlfriend?

568
00:44:13,267 --> 00:44:15,436
She reminds me of Lara.

569
00:44:16,069 --> 00:44:18,238
COO? That’s a pretty high position, right?

570
00:44:18,614 --> 00:44:21,200
So you’re holding onto
an important position.

571
00:44:21,492 --> 00:44:23,660
You have a name you’re protecting.

572
00:44:23,715 --> 00:44:27,093
Just to let you know,
I’m done with that life.

573
00:44:28,125 --> 00:44:30,586
So we both have secrets.
