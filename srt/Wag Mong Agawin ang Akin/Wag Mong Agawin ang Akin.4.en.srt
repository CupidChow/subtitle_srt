1
00:00:05,281 --> 00:00:06,490
Have you fallen?

2
00:00:09,130 --> 00:00:10,590
Damn girl.

3
00:00:10,615 --> 00:00:11,783
That’s a first.

4
00:00:12,493 --> 00:00:14,412
There’s something about him.

5
00:00:14,767 --> 00:00:17,103
It’s like there’s a connection between us.

6
00:00:17,866 --> 00:00:18,911
Tom!

7
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,178
I know that you’re still
hurt about what happened.

8
00:00:22,498 --> 00:00:23,874
And I understand.

9
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:25,790
And I’m glad you’re here.

10
00:00:28,286 --> 00:00:29,495
You know what?

11
00:00:29,972 --> 00:00:31,640
Prima has a new model.

12
00:00:31,895 --> 00:00:33,605
She’d be the same age as Lara if–

13
00:00:35,374 --> 00:00:38,335
I believe we’ll meet again.

14
00:00:39,891 --> 00:00:40,930
Uhm, Jasmine.

15
00:00:40,955 --> 00:00:42,790
This is Ryan Soriano, our COO.

16
00:00:42,815 --> 00:00:44,438
Jasmine, can I talk to you?

17
00:00:44,463 --> 00:00:45,475
Alone?

18
00:00:46,083 --> 00:00:49,545
Just to let you know,
I’m done with that life.

19
00:00:50,166 --> 00:00:52,043
So we both have a secret.

20
00:00:52,252 --> 00:00:54,713
What’s the dirt you have on Christine?

21
00:00:54,738 --> 00:00:56,740
She saw Christine the
other day with some guy.

22
00:00:57,233 --> 00:01:00,945
I don’t know who the guy
is, that’s why I wanna find out.

23
00:02:10,191 --> 00:02:12,568
So everything’s settled
for the contract signing.

24
00:02:13,125 --> 00:02:16,045
All that’s left is the menu, just
pick from the links that I sent you.

25
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:17,089
- Okay?
- Okay.

26
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:18,179
- Thank you.
- Okay.

27
00:02:18,204 --> 00:02:19,288
- Sephy.
- Thanks.

28
00:02:19,610 --> 00:02:21,176
Are you visiting your parents?

29
00:02:21,535 --> 00:02:22,587
Why?

30
00:02:25,115 --> 00:02:28,869
Ew! I hate these clothes,
my god it’s so not me.

31
00:02:28,894 --> 00:02:30,100
It’s Vince’s clothes.

32
00:02:30,635 --> 00:02:34,722
I know you’re visiting your parents
when you come to the office like that.

33
00:02:35,319 --> 00:02:36,654
When are you coming out?

34
00:02:36,947 --> 00:02:41,585
It’s better this way, that they don’t know.

35
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:44,859
Rather than giving my
father a heart attack.

36
00:02:45,707 --> 00:02:46,916
You’re right.

37
00:02:47,332 --> 00:02:49,209
Oh wait, let me ask you.

38
00:02:49,807 --> 00:02:52,101
How are you and your lover boy Tom?

39
00:02:52,719 --> 00:02:54,680
When do you plan to
stop keeping it a secret?

40
00:02:55,722 --> 00:02:57,516
I can’t help but feel guilty.

41
00:02:59,226 --> 00:03:02,312
He’s bringing up the proposal again.

42
00:03:02,785 --> 00:03:06,414
As long as he understands
your circumstances.

43
00:03:06,615 --> 00:03:07,913
That’s what's important.

44
00:03:08,368 --> 00:03:11,621
Vince and I agree even
though we have circumstances.

45
00:03:11,975 --> 00:03:15,979
I mean, my parents would die if they
found out I was gay.

46
00:03:16,257 --> 00:03:19,302
And on the other hand,
it could ruin his career.

47
00:03:19,809 --> 00:03:21,034
In your case,

48
00:03:21,700 --> 00:03:23,618
you’re the only one with the circumstance.

49
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,442
So you have to make sure that
he understands you.

50
00:03:28,673 --> 00:03:29,674
Okay, sis?

51
00:03:31,461 --> 00:03:32,629
Okay bye, sis.

52
00:03:42,999 --> 00:03:46,419
Introducing the new face of Prima Beauty.

53
00:03:46,444 --> 00:03:48,654
Jasmine Reyes or most
known for being a streetlamp girl

54
00:03:48,679 --> 00:03:51,648
signed a contract with Prima Beauty.

55
00:03:51,673 --> 00:03:55,718
According to Prima Beauty’s CEO,
Jasmine Reyes’ image is perfect

56
00:03:55,743 --> 00:03:58,434
to empower young
women like her to reach for

57
00:03:58,434 --> 00:04:01,208
their dreams even in the face of adversity.

58
00:04:01,232 --> 00:04:06,154
Jasmine Reyes will be the face of their
new perfume line.

59
00:04:06,437 --> 00:04:08,097
And there you have it everyone.

60
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:10,625
Congratulations, Miss Jasmine Reyes.

61
00:04:10,650 --> 00:04:13,255
The new face of Prima Beauty.

62
00:04:22,224 --> 00:04:23,725
Jasmine, congratulations!

63
00:04:38,767 --> 00:04:40,046
I need to go to the bathroom.

64
00:04:40,071 --> 00:04:41,197
- Sure.
- Just wait here.

65
00:04:41,222 --> 00:04:42,240
Hurry up.

66
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,957
Congratulations, hija.

67
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:52,000
Thank you.

68
00:04:52,250 --> 00:04:54,127
Technology nowadays is insane,

69
00:04:54,152 --> 00:04:58,596
you just need to pose on social media
and you’ll go viral.

70
00:04:59,164 --> 00:05:01,583
It’s so much easier nowadays.

71
00:05:02,195 --> 00:05:05,490
Uhm, sorry but who are you again ma’am?

72
00:05:06,153 --> 00:05:08,282
Oh, I’m Stella Soriano.

73
00:05:08,307 --> 00:05:11,602
You’ve met my son Ryan, the COO of Prima.

74
00:05:12,270 --> 00:05:16,107
Oh, and who are you?

75
00:05:16,132 --> 00:05:17,169
Oh,

76
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,236
I just happen to be the
previous CEO of Prima,

77
00:05:21,654 --> 00:05:23,948
that my ex-husband took from me,

78
00:05:23,948 --> 00:05:26,075
and gave to someone else.

79
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:30,954
Oh! Jasmine,

80
00:05:31,427 --> 00:05:33,721
since you’re the new face of Prima.

81
00:05:34,617 --> 00:05:36,243
You need to have class.

82
00:05:36,946 --> 00:05:39,991
You need to be prim
and proper, you know that.

83
00:05:40,394 --> 00:05:42,396
‘Cause that’s our brand's image.

84
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:46,839
Prim and proper? Oh no.

85
00:05:46,864 --> 00:05:48,239
That’s not me,

86
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,500
you should’ve gotten a different model.

87
00:05:51,103 --> 00:05:53,282
You know what, I was
actually surprised too.

88
00:06:01,396 --> 00:06:02,820
Okay.
Excuse me.

89
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:03,903
-Oh sure.
-Sure.

90
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,907
So, what are your future plans?

91
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,159
Oh Stella,

92
00:06:08,630 --> 00:06:10,382
what are you doing here?

93
00:06:10,827 --> 00:06:12,579
Isn’t it your bedtime?

94
00:06:13,121 --> 00:06:16,458
You should enjoy being a senior.

95
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:23,041
Thank you for the rescue, Miss Christine.

96
00:06:24,008 --> 00:06:25,515
She’s so full of herself.

97
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:30,896
Don’t mind her, she likes to
project her drama in life to everyone.

98
00:06:32,946 --> 00:06:34,948
Don’t throw your pearls to pigs.

99
00:06:35,192 --> 00:06:37,355
Your quote from that photo shoot was funny,

100
00:06:37,355 --> 00:06:39,649
but I get what you meant.

101
00:06:40,483 --> 00:06:41,567
Impressive.

102
00:06:42,546 --> 00:06:43,881
Oh, Miss Christine,

103
00:06:44,256 --> 00:06:47,509
I must have bought every single
magazine issue that you were featured in.

104
00:06:48,032 --> 00:06:49,367
That’s how much I idolize you.

105
00:06:50,753 --> 00:06:52,905
Thank you, I appreciate it.

106
00:06:53,305 --> 00:06:54,514
Wait, are you alone?

107
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,915
Where are your parents?

108
00:06:57,550 --> 00:06:59,009
It’s just me.

109
00:07:00,459 --> 00:07:02,127
I’ve been an orphan.

110
00:07:02,926 --> 00:07:04,803
Oh, I’m sorry to hear that.

111
00:07:06,009 --> 00:07:07,527
It’s okay Miss Christine,

112
00:07:07,552 --> 00:07:09,053
I’m here with my best friend.

113
00:07:09,254 --> 00:07:11,987
She’s like a mother to me, even though
we’re only two years apart.

114
00:07:13,751 --> 00:07:14,793
You know,

115
00:07:15,518 --> 00:07:18,855
you’re the reason why I
have the confidence now,

116
00:07:19,882 --> 00:07:22,301
because of your inspirational messages.

117
00:07:23,184 --> 00:07:25,603
I really strived to finish my studies.

118
00:07:27,677 --> 00:07:30,081
But, no matter what happens,

119
00:07:30,384 --> 00:07:33,053
I’ll do my best to work for Prima.

120
00:07:34,084 --> 00:07:37,003
But thank God, you approached me.

121
00:07:38,385 --> 00:07:41,013
I don’t want to be just
a model, Miss Christine.

122
00:07:41,688 --> 00:07:44,733
I really want to be in operations.

123
00:07:45,559 --> 00:07:47,519
I am a Management graduate.

124
00:07:49,181 --> 00:07:51,099
I know that’s why I’m impressed.

125
00:07:51,428 --> 00:07:52,513
Don’t worry,

126
00:07:52,804 --> 00:07:58,476
we’ll find a place for
you here in the company.

127
00:07:58,501 --> 00:07:59,521
Okay?

128
00:07:59,564 --> 00:08:00,688
Thank you.

129
00:08:00,688 --> 00:08:02,940
Sis, I just need to talk
to you about something.

130
00:08:02,940 --> 00:08:04,400
- Oh okay.
- Excuse me.

131
00:08:04,567 --> 00:08:05,902
Alright, excuse me.

132
00:08:05,927 --> 00:08:07,470
Thank you, Miss Christine.

133
00:08:13,433 --> 00:08:14,434
Congrats again.

134
00:08:18,873 --> 00:08:21,792
What are you looking at Mister Lopez?

135
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:23,324
Nothing.

136
00:08:23,349 --> 00:08:25,976
Aren’t you used to people
admiring your beauty?

137
00:08:28,591 --> 00:08:29,717
This is on me.

138
00:08:33,054 --> 00:08:36,599
Well, starting today this is your life now.

139
00:08:49,629 --> 00:08:51,714
You really made it, I’m so proud of you.

140
00:08:51,739 --> 00:08:53,991
You’re overreacting, but thank you.

141
00:08:53,991 --> 00:08:55,201
You’re still excited about it.

142
00:08:55,365 --> 00:08:57,367
I need to pee again.

143
00:08:57,758 --> 00:08:59,509
I should’ve gone to ther restroom earlier.

144
00:09:00,115 --> 00:09:02,211
- Is there a restroom here somewhere?
- Over there.

145
00:09:02,236 --> 00:09:03,365
There’s one there.

146
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:04,474
Okay, wait here.

147
00:09:04,499 --> 00:09:05,511
Sure.

148
00:09:11,147 --> 00:09:12,732
Hi, congratulations.

149
00:09:12,757 --> 00:09:13,792
Thank you.

150
00:09:14,195 --> 00:09:16,489
I’m also a model here, hair and make up.

151
00:09:17,499 --> 00:09:18,517
Wow,

152
00:09:19,124 --> 00:09:20,708
what’s it like working here?

153
00:09:21,169 --> 00:09:23,504
Well, mostly it’s just my hair they see.

154
00:09:23,678 --> 00:09:24,793
I’m a hair double.

155
00:09:25,299 --> 00:09:27,301
Oh, that’s a thing.

156
00:09:28,698 --> 00:09:30,742
Just maintain your
assets and you’ll be okay.

157
00:09:30,767 --> 00:09:33,686
You know, if we have it, we use it.

158
00:09:34,475 --> 00:09:35,601
Hello!

159
00:09:36,032 --> 00:09:38,368
You’ve met my good friend, Chelsea.

160
00:09:44,262 --> 00:09:46,598
You know what, Chelsea was also from
the perfume line.

161
00:09:47,343 --> 00:09:48,421
Everything was set,

162
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:51,382
we we’re about to shoot the ads
and the line up was all prepared.

163
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:54,260
But, Christine found
someone else she likes,

164
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:56,038
and she was replaced just like that.

165
00:09:56,407 --> 00:09:58,617
That doesn’t sound like Miss Christine.

166
00:09:59,038 --> 00:10:01,374
I think there’s a reason why that happened.

167
00:10:01,557 --> 00:10:03,768
That’s why she left when you arrived.

168
00:10:04,011 --> 00:10:05,888
Don’t be so sure.

169
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:09,758
All I know is that when she
gets want she wants with you,

170
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:10,788
you’re out.

171
00:10:12,291 --> 00:10:13,709
You know what, Sir?

172
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,449
I met your mom earlier

173
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:18,297
and you sound just like her.

174
00:10:21,203 --> 00:10:23,289
In this industry, one
mistake and you’re out.

175
00:10:23,289 --> 00:10:24,498
So be careful.

176
00:10:30,796 --> 00:10:32,506
Oh, you're done?

177
00:10:32,506 --> 00:10:34,261
Infairness the restroom
was air conditioned.

178
00:10:35,069 --> 00:10:36,355
It looks nice.

179
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,417
Yeah it is.

180
00:10:38,635 --> 00:10:39,864
- Oh.
- Oh?

181
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,474
I forgot my contract.

182
00:10:41,474 --> 00:10:42,475
Why, where is it?

183
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:45,369
- Sir Jonathan?
- Yes?

184
00:10:45,394 --> 00:10:47,021
Have you seen my contract?

185
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:49,381
The contracts are with Sir Tom.

186
00:10:50,558 --> 00:10:51,976
- Ah okay, Thank you.
- Sure.

187
00:10:52,898 --> 00:10:53,919
Wait.

188
00:10:53,944 --> 00:10:55,921
- I just need to get my contract from Tom.
- Okay.

189
00:10:55,946 --> 00:10:57,258
Hurry up.

190
00:11:00,817 --> 00:11:02,569
What are we gonna do with the contracts?

191
00:11:02,594 --> 00:11:04,764
I’ll take care of it, I’ll
give them to Jasmine.

192
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:06,690
- I’ll bring it to the legal department.
- Okay.

193
00:11:06,903 --> 00:11:08,000
- Let’s go.
- Let’s go.

194
00:11:32,054 --> 00:11:33,526
Here are the contracts, love.

195
00:11:35,528 --> 00:11:36,612
Thank you.

196
00:11:42,508 --> 00:11:43,619
Love

197
00:14:02,204 --> 00:14:03,235
What?

198
00:14:03,631 --> 00:14:04,652
Did you get it?

199
00:14:04,677 --> 00:14:09,139
No, he went inside Miss Christine’s office
and locked the door.

200
00:14:10,271 --> 00:14:12,080
Do you think they’re doing something else?

201
00:14:12,446 --> 00:14:13,488
You think?

202
00:14:15,428 --> 00:14:16,763
No, that’s impossible.

203
00:14:18,098 --> 00:14:21,936
Their age difference is too big.

204
00:14:22,528 --> 00:14:23,737
Why? How old is Tom?

205
00:14:23,823 --> 00:14:24,863
Twenty-eight.

206
00:14:24,863 --> 00:14:25,864
How about Miss Christine?

207
00:14:27,337 --> 00:14:30,465
She just had her birthday,
so I think forty-two?

208
00:14:30,574 --> 00:14:32,154
Wow, that’s a big age gap.

209
00:14:33,588 --> 00:14:35,256
Come on, let’s go home.

210
00:14:35,321 --> 00:14:36,329
That’s fine.

211
00:14:36,465 --> 00:14:37,543
It’s nothing.

212
00:14:40,337 --> 00:14:43,966
So, for this quarter the numbers
are looking good.

213
00:14:44,938 --> 00:14:45,938
Okay,

214
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:47,906
let’s maintain those numbers.

215
00:14:48,332 --> 00:14:50,773
So what’s our target for the next quarter?

216
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:53,674
Actually, that’s what I
want to bring up with you.

217
00:14:54,270 --> 00:14:56,402
Considering we have a new model.

218
00:14:56,937 --> 00:14:59,857
It’s somewhat risky, if we use her
as the face of the company,

219
00:14:59,857 --> 00:15:01,233
the sales could decrease.

220
00:15:01,955 --> 00:15:03,480
Sales could also increase,

221
00:15:03,809 --> 00:15:06,145
since her story is very inspirational.

222
00:15:06,995 --> 00:15:10,456
People like inspirational stories.

223
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:14,231
I hope you’re making the
right decision here Christine.

224
00:15:15,598 --> 00:15:17,529
There you go again, Ryan.

225
00:15:18,471 --> 00:15:21,683
Did I embarrass you in
front of the Marketing team?

226
00:15:22,118 --> 00:15:23,354
Is that your ego talking?

227
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,760
Come on, grow-up Ryan.

228
00:15:25,785 --> 00:15:27,954
You really got Dad’s style.

229
00:15:29,293 --> 00:15:31,003
He trained me well.

230
00:15:32,463 --> 00:15:36,884
You were just Dad’s assistant, remember?

231
00:15:38,403 --> 00:15:39,489
Yes,

232
00:15:39,645 --> 00:15:41,272
and I’m not ashamed of it.

233
00:15:41,974 --> 00:15:44,893
I even tell our employees about it,
in our training sessions.

234
00:15:45,254 --> 00:15:48,773
To inspire them, that hard work pays.

235
00:15:49,614 --> 00:15:53,326
Not just because you're the wife or
son of the owner.

236
00:15:55,136 --> 00:15:56,172
Okay,

237
00:15:56,833 --> 00:15:57,901
my bad.

238
00:15:58,439 --> 00:16:00,107
I shouldn’t have said that, I’m sorry.

239
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:04,989
I rose through the ranks, ‘cause
I worked hard for it, right?

240
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:06,924
After experiencing bruises,

241
00:16:07,216 --> 00:16:08,509
broken bones,

242
00:16:08,890 --> 00:16:11,351
and abuse from him.

243
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:13,847
You know I deserve this Ryan.

244
00:16:14,973 --> 00:16:16,892
I rebuilt this company.

245
00:16:17,126 --> 00:16:19,113
You can bring this up
with the board, if you want.

246
00:16:19,774 --> 00:16:20,830
Christine,

247
00:16:24,328 --> 00:16:26,246
you’re not the only one deserving.

248
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:28,237
You bastard!

249
00:16:28,237 --> 00:16:29,822
Who were you with?

250
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:31,532
When are you gonna stop?

251
00:16:31,532 --> 00:16:32,741
You’re too old for this!

252
00:16:32,741 --> 00:16:34,535
At your age–

253
00:16:34,743 --> 00:16:36,286
When will you stop?

254
00:16:36,537 --> 00:16:38,247
You don’t need to shout at me.

255
00:16:38,247 --> 00:16:39,373
Yes, I will shout at you.

256
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:41,458
Because you’re a cheater, you don’t stop.

257
00:16:41,628 --> 00:16:43,395
You don’t want to stop!

258
00:16:44,008 --> 00:16:47,053
Fine, go with them and
make their life miserable.

259
00:16:47,297 --> 00:16:49,675
- Don’t you fucking shout at me!
- I will shout at–

260
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:52,219
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it.

261
00:17:11,245 --> 00:17:12,300
Mom.

262
00:17:13,738 --> 00:17:14,989
Son, I'm sorry.

263
00:17:15,171 --> 00:17:17,048
I can’t do this anymore.

264
00:17:17,944 --> 00:17:22,743
I know it will cost me, but I just can’t.

265
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,587
I’m filing for an annulment.

266
00:17:27,107 --> 00:17:30,610
And I know, we’ll lose
our place in the company.

267
00:17:32,001 --> 00:17:34,253
Mom, what can I do to help?

268
00:17:35,804 --> 00:17:38,891
Ryan, fight for your right as his son.

269
00:17:39,475 --> 00:17:40,601
I wanna help you.

270
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,635
Okay?

271
00:17:42,203 --> 00:17:45,581
He already pushed me away,
don’t let him do this to you.

272
00:17:45,606 --> 00:17:47,274
Okay?
Promise?

273
00:17:47,274 --> 00:17:48,942
Promise.
I will.

274
00:17:49,485 --> 00:17:51,278
I’ll take care of you, Mom.

275
00:17:51,361 --> 00:17:54,782
So promise me, you won’t end up like him.

276
00:17:54,901 --> 00:17:55,933
No.

277
00:17:55,958 --> 00:17:58,085
I know you’ll be better.

278
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:01,538
Promise me, okay?

279
00:18:02,206 --> 00:18:03,248
Promise.

280
00:18:23,310 --> 00:18:26,688
So what did you do this time that
your Dad punched you?

281
00:18:26,939 --> 00:18:28,816
The file’s spelling was wrong.

282
00:18:29,015 --> 00:18:30,067
Fuck, right?

283
00:18:31,193 --> 00:18:32,486
Here’s an ice pack,

284
00:18:33,153 --> 00:18:34,279
so it heals faster.

285
00:18:34,304 --> 00:18:35,311
Thanks.

286
00:18:35,781 --> 00:18:38,659
He punched you because
of a misspelled word?

287
00:18:41,119 --> 00:18:44,081
I get yelled at when the
coffee I make is wrong.

288
00:18:44,488 --> 00:18:48,534
Remember, he likes black
coffee to cure hangovers.

289
00:18:49,422 --> 00:18:53,635
There was this one time his secretary
made him an instant coffee.

290
00:18:54,007 --> 00:18:55,926
I was just the one who gave it to him.

291
00:18:56,628 --> 00:19:00,034
He cursed me out.

292
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:01,640
That bad?

293
00:19:01,640 --> 00:19:04,059
- I can’t believe you married my Dad
- You said it.

294
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:06,030
He just gaslighted you.

295
00:19:07,408 --> 00:19:09,661
I didn’t know he was that terrible.

296
00:19:10,065 --> 00:19:15,362
I guess, my love wasn’t
enough to change him.

297
00:19:15,904 --> 00:19:20,617
I just suffered more.

298
00:19:29,006 --> 00:19:31,050
I want to get out of here.

299
00:19:32,064 --> 00:19:33,690
Can you come with me?

300
00:19:34,642 --> 00:19:37,770
Why is Dad so bitter?

301
00:19:39,295 --> 00:19:42,798
‘Cause he drinks black coffee.

302
00:19:44,960 --> 00:19:46,419
Were you being funny?

303
00:19:49,557 --> 00:19:50,591
Christine?

304
00:19:55,790 --> 00:19:57,625
After you made love,

305
00:19:58,739 --> 00:20:00,991
how often does he beat you?

306
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:03,076
Once a week?

307
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:04,636
Twice a week?

308
00:20:07,837 --> 00:20:11,632
Almost everyday.

309
00:20:13,170 --> 00:20:19,051
Particularly, when the business isn’t good.

310
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:27,322
There are days when–

311
00:20:28,078 --> 00:20:30,038
he’s really affectionate.

312
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,858
You’d think he’s a changed man

313
00:20:36,490 --> 00:20:37,700
and he’s sorry.

314
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:39,321
You know.

315
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,661
Especially when he’s not in the mood,

316
00:20:46,657 --> 00:20:48,242
and I make mistakes.

317
00:20:52,042 --> 00:20:56,797
So after all that, you’d
still sleep with him?

318
00:20:59,466 --> 00:21:01,843
Most of the time he just forces me.

319
00:21:06,107 --> 00:21:07,400
Do you love him?

320
00:21:16,503 --> 00:21:18,922
Stop it Ryan, I’m your stepmom.

321
00:21:24,083 --> 00:21:26,544
Aren’t you comfortable with me?

322
00:21:27,136 --> 00:21:30,181
I know you didn’t marry my father for love.

323
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:42,968
You know what?

324
00:21:44,997 --> 00:21:47,833
I’ve always had a crush on you.

325
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:55,981
I know how Dad abuses you.

326
00:21:58,233 --> 00:22:01,862
That’s why no one will
understand you, like I do.

327
00:23:33,164 --> 00:23:34,457
You know what Tin?

328
00:23:34,855 --> 00:23:37,022
I remember everything.

329
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,308
We made love.

330
00:23:39,927 --> 00:23:41,870
We had so much fun.

331
00:23:41,895 --> 00:23:43,940
We’ve been through a lot.

332
00:23:45,951 --> 00:23:50,183
That was a mistake and
it won’t happen again.

333
00:23:55,142 --> 00:23:58,645
By the way, Mom hired
a private investigator.

334
00:23:59,075 --> 00:24:00,576
You or your mother?

335
00:24:00,765 --> 00:24:02,016
Stop this nonsense.

336
00:24:02,511 --> 00:24:04,722
You should be thanking me.

337
00:24:04,836 --> 00:24:06,588
‘Cause I’m protecting you.

338
00:24:06,613 --> 00:24:07,939
Protection from what?

339
00:24:07,964 --> 00:24:08,967
Huh?

340
00:24:08,992 --> 00:24:10,425
Or do you mean harassment?

341
00:24:11,236 --> 00:24:15,894
Time is ticking Christine, don’t let
anyone be like that missing boy toy.

342
00:24:17,674 --> 00:24:19,676
Missing boy toy?

343
00:24:20,333 --> 00:24:22,419
How is your boy toy?

344
00:24:22,419 --> 00:24:23,795
I don’t know.

345
00:24:24,574 --> 00:24:26,742
He ghosted me.

346
00:24:27,597 --> 00:24:29,453
Hilda’s boyfriend?

347
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:37,281
Sorry, I thought he was your boyfriend.

348
00:24:39,016 --> 00:24:42,013
Don’t do anything stupid.

349
00:24:42,939 --> 00:24:44,563
And be cautious.

350
00:24:45,525 --> 00:24:48,242
If you’re seeing someone,
you should tell me now.

351
00:24:48,904 --> 00:24:50,238
That’s a warning.

352
00:24:51,114 --> 00:24:54,701
You know what Ryan, If I
hadn't known your father–

353
00:24:54,823 --> 00:24:56,909
I would assume you were just joking.

354
00:24:57,508 --> 00:24:59,513
But I’ll tell you this.

355
00:25:00,009 --> 00:25:02,428
You resent your father.

356
00:25:03,055 --> 00:25:04,882
So don’t act like him.

357
00:25:26,006 --> 00:25:27,216
Hey, bitch!

358
00:25:29,051 --> 00:25:30,156
Is this you?

359
00:25:30,486 --> 00:25:31,572
Son of a bitch,

360
00:25:32,426 --> 00:25:33,458
this is you!

361
00:25:33,483 --> 00:25:35,527
Ma'am, maybe we can talk about it.

362
00:25:35,621 --> 00:25:36,743
Talk about it?

363
00:25:37,162 --> 00:25:39,197
- You’re my husband’s mistress!
- I’m not, ma’am.

364
00:25:39,222 --> 00:25:41,456
- You thought I wouldn’t find you.
- No, his my client–

365
00:25:41,456 --> 00:25:42,832
Your husband’s my client, ma’am.

366
00:25:43,157 --> 00:25:46,660
Oh, so my husband’s your customer?

367
00:25:46,685 --> 00:25:47,796
Ma’am maybe–

368
00:25:48,490 --> 00:25:49,923
You’re a slut.

369
00:25:49,923 --> 00:25:51,024
- Whore!
- They might hear–

370
00:25:51,049 --> 00:25:52,801
Ma’am they might hear you.

371
00:25:53,007 --> 00:25:55,362
So what, are you scared?

372
00:25:55,387 --> 00:25:57,030
You’re scared you might get caught?

373
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:59,391
‘Cause, what you’re doing is illegal.

374
00:25:59,741 --> 00:26:02,494
- Police! Police!
- Motherfucker, I told you to shut up!

375
00:26:02,519 --> 00:26:03,770
- Police! Police!
- Fuck you!

376
00:26:03,770 --> 00:26:05,689
- Police!
- Shut the fuck up!

377
00:26:05,845 --> 00:26:09,014
Tin, what’s this emergency
you’re talking about?

378
00:26:09,774 --> 00:26:11,484
Your boy toy–

379
00:26:11,721 --> 00:26:12,931
The one that ghosted you.

380
00:26:13,355 --> 00:26:14,940
Do you have updates on him?

381
00:26:15,849 --> 00:26:17,309
I don’t check anymore.

382
00:26:17,830 --> 00:26:19,846
I don’t see him posting
anything on social media.

383
00:26:20,352 --> 00:26:24,857
Besides, if he needs me he’ll contact me.

384
00:26:25,789 --> 00:26:27,041
Can you please check,

385
00:26:27,401 --> 00:26:29,194
his social media page.

386
00:26:29,799 --> 00:26:31,801
Why are you so anxious?

387
00:26:32,942 --> 00:26:35,069
Why are you so invested in him?

388
00:26:36,345 --> 00:26:37,368
What?

389
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:39,573
Hilda, what?

390
00:26:39,823 --> 00:26:41,241
Oh my god, Tin.

391
00:26:42,891 --> 00:26:45,435
People are posting condolences on his page.

392
00:26:47,785 --> 00:26:48,828
He died.

393
00:26:48,853 --> 00:26:50,891
Oh my god, he was murdered.

394
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:53,614
My god.

395
00:26:54,874 --> 00:26:56,959
How did you know?

396
00:26:58,384 --> 00:27:01,679
Hilda, it’s Ryan.

397
00:27:01,885 --> 00:27:02,915
What?

398
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:08,483
He mistook your boyfriend for mine
after seeing a picture of the three of us.

399
00:27:08,750 --> 00:27:10,127
That’s why.

400
00:27:10,335 --> 00:27:13,755
That's what he was saying, and I assumed
he was joking.

401
00:27:15,005 --> 00:27:16,673
That fucking man-child.

402
00:27:18,855 --> 00:27:20,857
Tin, this is my fault.

403
00:27:21,253 --> 00:27:23,172
I should’ve checked on him.

404
00:27:24,480 --> 00:27:28,067
I wish I could have just
let him follow me around.

405
00:27:28,401 --> 00:27:30,278
‘Cause that’s how he is.

406
00:27:32,064 --> 00:27:34,900
No Hilda, you didn’t do anything wrong.

407
00:27:35,373 --> 00:27:37,667
This is Ryan’s fault.

408
00:27:38,995 --> 00:27:41,993
Tin, we need to tell the police.

409
00:27:42,776 --> 00:27:44,653
Do you think I hadn't considered that?

410
00:27:45,028 --> 00:27:48,086
We don’t have evidence,
aside from what he says.

411
00:27:48,839 --> 00:27:53,594
And also, Stella will find a way to
make sure Ryan doesn’t go to prison.

412
00:27:53,619 --> 00:27:55,454
We don’t stand a chance, Hilda.

413
00:27:56,957 --> 00:27:59,167
Please help me on this Tin, please.

414
00:27:59,192 --> 00:28:00,203
I will.

415
00:28:01,871 --> 00:28:02,928
Please.

416
00:28:15,515 --> 00:28:16,532
Hi love.

417
00:28:18,206 --> 00:28:19,290
Hi love.

418
00:28:19,924 --> 00:28:22,009
You’re deep in thought again.

419
00:28:27,085 --> 00:28:28,170
Love.

420
00:28:30,054 --> 00:28:31,680
Let's not see each other for now.

421
00:28:32,174 --> 00:28:33,300
Why?

422
00:28:36,018 --> 00:28:38,979
Ryan is dangerous,

423
00:28:39,362 --> 00:28:40,780
he’s a murderer.

424
00:28:42,099 --> 00:28:43,934
I’m not afraid of him.

425
00:28:45,034 --> 00:28:47,220
I’m worried for you.

426
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:51,443
You don’t even trust
that I can protect you.

427
00:28:52,063 --> 00:28:54,315
People like Ryan are cowards.

428
00:28:54,566 --> 00:28:58,611
He feeds on other people's fears, but
he’s weak for people who're fearless.

429
00:29:00,307 --> 00:29:04,145
Say what you want,
I will not risk your safety.

430
00:29:06,018 --> 00:29:08,103
We should take a break.

431
00:29:10,094 --> 00:29:11,804
Don’t I have a say in this?

432
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:14,440
None.

433
00:29:14,919 --> 00:29:18,298
I don't care if you get mad
at me, I'd rather accept that

434
00:29:18,519 --> 00:29:21,397
than lose you because of Ryan.

435
00:29:24,448 --> 00:29:25,495
Tom.

436
00:29:27,358 --> 00:29:28,389
Tom.

437
00:29:35,690 --> 00:29:39,110
How are you?

438
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:45,341
Hey.

439
00:29:45,622 --> 00:29:47,541
- Oh, what happened?
- Hey, hey.

440
00:29:47,566 --> 00:29:48,604
Wait.

441
00:29:49,159 --> 00:29:50,994
It was just an aggressive wife.

442
00:29:51,431 --> 00:29:52,599
Again?

443
00:29:53,434 --> 00:29:55,019
Well, what's new.

444
00:29:55,528 --> 00:29:58,156
You know what Marie, just leave the club.

445
00:29:59,058 --> 00:30:00,476
And stop whatever this is.

446
00:30:01,117 --> 00:30:02,535
Leave that life behind.

447
00:30:02,806 --> 00:30:04,683
What am I supposed to do, Jasmine?

448
00:30:05,350 --> 00:30:07,853
How am I going to pay
the bills and earn a living?

449
00:30:08,623 --> 00:30:10,166
I’m not like you.

450
00:30:10,549 --> 00:30:13,677
- This is all I know.
- Yeah, all you know.

451
00:30:14,144 --> 00:30:16,204
I’ve heard that before.

452
00:30:19,797 --> 00:30:20,847
You know,

453
00:30:20,872 --> 00:30:26,962
people can do whatever
they want if they really want to.

454
00:30:27,898 --> 00:30:30,651
It's not true that you
can’t do anything else.

455
00:30:31,763 --> 00:30:33,765
What will I do if I don’t have an income?

456
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:47,428
Here, this will cover our
food and monthly bills.

457
00:30:49,588 --> 00:30:52,132
This is a lot– Jasmine,
you got your first pay?

458
00:30:52,737 --> 00:30:53,863
Wow.

459
00:30:55,595 --> 00:30:56,763
Save it.

460
00:30:56,958 --> 00:30:59,990
Don’t worry about me,
I’m not your responsibility.

461
00:31:00,015 --> 00:31:01,067
Wait.

462
00:31:01,768 --> 00:31:04,729
I'll decide what my
responsibilities should be.

463
00:31:04,818 --> 00:31:07,362
When I say this is for us.

464
00:31:07,807 --> 00:31:09,434
This is for us.

465
00:31:10,838 --> 00:31:11,922
Thank you.

466
00:31:12,249 --> 00:31:13,959
It’s like we’re a married couple.

467
00:31:15,009 --> 00:31:16,218
Come here.

468
00:31:16,243 --> 00:31:17,250
Wait, it hurts.

469
00:31:17,250 --> 00:31:18,626
Oh, sorry.

470
00:31:18,626 --> 00:31:19,877
Sorry I forgot.

471
00:31:57,489 --> 00:32:00,659
Jasmine’s very seductive.

472
00:32:05,829 --> 00:32:07,039
Okay, game.

473
00:32:09,518 --> 00:32:10,561
Smile.

474
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:15,657
One more.

475
00:32:24,335 --> 00:32:26,462
Jasmine, are you okay? You look distracted.

476
00:32:28,125 --> 00:32:31,602
I can’t– I can’t find my motivation.

477
00:32:32,742 --> 00:32:33,868
Tom, come here for a sec.

478
00:32:33,868 --> 00:32:36,694
Let’s motivate your model.

479
00:32:39,907 --> 00:32:41,492
Look at Tom.

480
00:32:41,838 --> 00:32:44,633
Imagine you’re in love with him and
you want to kiss him.

481
00:32:45,032 --> 00:32:46,047
Okay?

482
00:32:46,072 --> 00:32:47,532
Okay, ready.

483
00:34:05,626 --> 00:34:06,669
Love.

484
00:34:06,728 --> 00:34:08,312
Let's not see each other for now.

485
00:34:08,337 --> 00:34:10,423
Let’s take a break.

486
00:35:10,174 --> 00:35:11,884
Are you okay?

487
00:37:47,201 --> 00:37:48,410
Benito.

488
00:37:48,686 --> 00:37:50,063
Benito.

489
00:37:54,563 --> 00:37:55,982
Benito?

490
00:38:01,570 --> 00:38:02,780
Benito.

491
00:38:04,907 --> 00:38:06,659
Benito!

492
00:38:15,793 --> 00:38:18,337
Benito, you’re hurting me.

493
00:38:18,648 --> 00:38:21,108
Don't do this to me, Benito.

494
00:38:21,888 --> 00:38:23,306
Benito.

495
00:38:43,696 --> 00:38:45,364
Lara!

496
00:38:46,128 --> 00:38:48,005
Lara!

497
00:38:49,277 --> 00:38:51,154
Lara!

498
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:54,915
Lara!

499
00:39:37,416 --> 00:39:39,210
Hello, Jasmine?

500
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,181
Can we talk?

501
00:40:35,223 --> 00:40:37,277
I have a question.

502
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:45,324
Hello Christine.

503
00:40:47,444 --> 00:40:49,238
I had fun Jasmine.

504
00:40:49,238 --> 00:40:50,614
I enjoyed your company.

505
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,659
I enjoyed your company
more, Miss Christine.

506
00:40:53,684 --> 00:40:55,608
I wish you were my mother.

507
00:40:56,221 --> 00:40:58,182
My life would’ve been happier.

508
00:40:59,258 --> 00:41:00,749
Why so serious?

509
00:41:00,983 --> 00:41:03,486
What do you call it when you love someone

510
00:41:03,511 --> 00:41:05,212
but you’re also attracted to someone else?

511
00:41:06,039 --> 00:41:07,291
That’s cool.

512
00:41:07,715 --> 00:41:10,452
I really really like him.

513
00:41:10,477 --> 00:41:12,979
This is the first time I've felt this way.

514
00:41:13,127 --> 00:41:17,156
I like him so much that it affects my work.

515
00:41:17,183 --> 00:41:19,643
If he can't give you what you need

516
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:20,769
then let go.

517
00:41:21,382 --> 00:41:23,497
I already lost my daughter.

518
00:41:23,522 --> 00:41:26,734
I can’t afford to lose you too.
