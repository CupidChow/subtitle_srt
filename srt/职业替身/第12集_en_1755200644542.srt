1
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:57,800
Joe. Joe.

2
00:01:58,600 --> 00:01:59,800
Joe.

3
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:03,000
Joe.

4
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:14,320
Joe.

5
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:15,800
Joe.

6
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:18,200
Joe.

7
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:23,160
Joe.

8
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:38,880
I actually know that...you're kinda tired of being a stand-in.

9
00:02:38,880 --> 00:02:42,320
But I didn't know that you would make a shortcut.

10
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:44,240
Stop what you're doing now

11
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:45,960
before his family knows.

12
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:48,120
I'm saying this because I'm worried about you.

13
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:49,760
These people only date celebrities.

14
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:51,640
He doesn't love you,

15
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:52,920
he just feels guilty.

16
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,400
Can you promise me? That you won't go back to him.

17
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:59,640
Ming and I broke up.

18
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:01,480
But I'm happy.

19
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:04,400
So you'll no longer be involved with that kind of person.

20
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:09,680
I don't understand why you agreed to this.

21
00:03:10,240 --> 00:03:12,440
Even if I had to die,

22
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:15,720
i would never want my son to get the money this way.

23
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:16,920
Mom, I'm sorry.

24
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:20,600
I didn't want to. But if it weren't for him golddigging,

25
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:23,120
and you being so blind like this...

26
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:25,079
Break up!

27
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:28,560
You dare exchange our family's reputation with him?

28
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:34,040
In the future, our family will push Ming harder.

29
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:37,400
And in the end, they will force you two to break up anyway.

30
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,520
The sooner it ends, the sooner you two won't waste your time.

31
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:53,400
Joe.

32
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,040
Don't you love me anymore?

33
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:03,240
Don't you want me to wait for you to come home anymore?

34
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:23,760
Are you not eating?

35
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,560
Seeing you eat makes me full already.

36
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:26,800
You know your way with words.

37
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:28,480
You must've had lots of people eating here.

38
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:30,560
Well, it'd be nice to have what you said.

39
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:32,720
If you were to be my first one...

40
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:34,520
I wouldn't deny that.

41
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:48,640
Are you back?

42
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,240
Are you really moving in with me?

43
00:05:56,480 --> 00:05:57,480
What are you doing?

44
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:09,120
I'm hungry, let's go eat.

45
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:10,880
Stay still, let me...

46
00:06:12,040 --> 00:06:12,680
That's enough.

47
00:06:12,680 --> 00:06:14,200
Why?

48
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,440
Your life savings and that man...

49
00:06:42,159 --> 00:06:44,680
I think...it's not so difficult to choose.

50
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:46,360
But I choose Joe.

51
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:51,040
Ten million Baht in exchange of me and him.

52
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:54,120
Because he's an important one to me.

53
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:57,200
No one can ever replace him.

54
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,640
Joe.

55
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:02,200
Joe.

56
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,640
Joe.

57
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:19,520
Joe.

58
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,160
Joe.

59
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,640
Joe. Joe.

60
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:32,560
Joe. Thank you.

61
00:07:33,800 --> 00:07:35,000
Joe.

62
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:40,040
Joe.

63
00:07:43,159 --> 00:07:45,159
No matter how many times I gotta choose,

64
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,159
I still choose the same thing.

65
00:07:59,400 --> 00:08:01,520
Because someone is waiting for me.

66
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
Once you choose your own path,

67
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:14,680
you won't have to be a substitute for anyone any longer.

68
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:32,799
Hello.

69
00:08:34,600 --> 00:08:36,440
Did you get Joe?

70
00:08:38,120 --> 00:08:40,600
Ming, stay calm.

71
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:45,880
Joe had an accident at the setting.

72
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:48,760
He fell off the cliff.

73
00:08:49,400 --> 00:08:51,480
Right now, we still can't find him.

74
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:54,960
Mr. Ming.

75
00:08:55,880 --> 00:08:57,000
Mr. Ming...

76
00:10:15,840 --> 00:10:17,040
Joe.

77
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,400
Ming.

78
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,120
Don't you ever disappear again.

79
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:00,920
Ming.

80
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:03,280
I've told you I'm alright. I can eat by myself.

81
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:06,760
But I wanna feed you.

82
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:28,240
Hey, Joe!

83
00:11:36,880 --> 00:11:38,080
Hello.

84
00:11:43,800 --> 00:11:45,760
I'll go grab some coffee then.

85
00:11:52,560 --> 00:11:56,400
So? Real-life stunt scene, huh?

86
00:11:57,240 --> 00:11:58,760
Almost didn't make it.

87
00:11:58,760 --> 00:12:00,520
Damn you, don't make us worry next time.

88
00:12:00,520 --> 00:12:04,200
Here. Eat this. Hey, put it there.

89
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:05,840
Hey, can I sit here? / Of course, please sit.

90
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:06,920
Thank you so much, Wut.

91
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:24,960
Why don't you come inside?

92
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:29,160
I don't like lots of people.

93
00:12:37,040 --> 00:12:39,000
When I first got into the industry,

94
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,120
Wut had Joe pair up with me.

95
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,800
We ate, we slept in the same room.

96
00:12:47,240 --> 00:12:49,160
We got drunk together.

97
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:51,640
Until one day...

98
00:12:52,760 --> 00:12:54,760
I found out that he liked guys.

99
00:12:59,960 --> 00:13:01,760
I was so shocked.

100
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:04,120
I thought he was trying to take advantage of me.

101
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:07,880
And that time there was
a good opportunity from Korea,

102
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:09,680
so I took it.

103
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:13,000
And in order to get away from him too.

104
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:15,640
But in the end,

105
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:18,560
it was I who missed him.

106
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:22,480
My intention was to come back to see Joe.

107
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:25,720
But you got to him first.

108
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:32,000
I'm sorry about that.

109
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,520
When Joe was back,

110
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,880
I thought heaven gave me another chance.

111
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:42,120
But no...

112
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:46,840
So do I need to say sorry again?

113
00:13:46,840 --> 00:13:48,440
No.

114
00:13:48,440 --> 00:13:51,440
The one who got another chance was Joe.

115
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:54,480
And he still chose you.

116
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:03,040
Can you promise me that you will protect him,

117
00:14:04,400 --> 00:14:07,040
and not let anyone in your family hurt him?

118
00:14:08,440 --> 00:14:10,640
I may not be able to promise you that...

119
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:16,320
because I've already promised that to myself.

120
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:21,720
You're always earlier than me.

121
00:14:26,360 --> 00:14:30,360
But I believe that, even if I came first,

122
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:36,720
eventually, he would still choose you.

123
00:15:08,800 --> 00:15:12,360
I've already checked. Mr. Joe is on the 7th floor.

124
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
Who's that?

125
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,600
Mmm, that's Joe's Mom.

126
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:32,040
Are you here to visit your son?

127
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:33,800
Oh, yes.

128
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:36,040
How do you know that?

129
00:15:36,040 --> 00:15:39,880
I'm also a mother too so I can tell.

130
00:15:39,880 --> 00:15:42,760
And why don't you go see him?

131
00:15:43,480 --> 00:15:45,160
Well,

132
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,040
we had a fight, and I pushed him away.

133
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,480
So I don't know if he'd like to see me now.

134
00:15:59,880 --> 00:16:03,520
Actually, I'm Ming's mother.

135
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:07,080
Ming...the one that your son is dating.

136
00:16:07,080 --> 00:16:10,680
I was the one who sent a lawyer
with evidence to your house.

137
00:16:12,080 --> 00:16:15,760
I'm sorry for causing your son trouble.

138
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:22,640
I just wanted my son to date someone suitable.

139
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:26,120
And now I know...

140
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:29,080
that your son is the most suitable one for him.

141
00:16:34,960 --> 00:16:38,040
They both really love each other.

142
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:41,440
The reason Ming lent him the money was

143
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:44,400
because he saw that you're a family.

144
00:16:45,040 --> 00:16:47,240
Please don't be mad at Joe.

145
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:50,960
Deep down, I'd like them both...

146
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,120
to be sincere to each other.

147
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:00,600
May I ask you something, as a Mother?

148
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:09,880
How could you accept this thing like an ordinary stuff?

149
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:16,200
Before, I couldn't accept it.

150
00:17:16,839 --> 00:17:22,560
But we had a fight and Joe almost ended his life.

151
00:17:23,599 --> 00:17:26,680
When I thought of losing my son, I realized...

152
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:30,320
no matter which kind of love it was, it's all ordinary.

153
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:33,520
What's not ordinary...

154
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,240
is a mother who didn't care about her son's feelings.

155
00:17:41,480 --> 00:17:43,000
Thank you.

156
00:17:45,320 --> 00:17:47,040
Let's go pay him a visit.

157
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:49,320
Alright.

158
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:13,320
Where are the others?

159
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:15,000
They left.

160
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:18,640
You may continue.

161
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:22,000
On what?

162
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,040
What you were doing before...

163
00:18:25,040 --> 00:18:28,400
Here, I'm so hungry.

164
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,040
We happened to meet outside.

165
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:56,400
Oh, yes.

166
00:18:58,360 --> 00:19:01,000
Ming's Mom told me everything.

167
00:19:01,000 --> 00:19:04,880
I...I'm sorry I was too quick to judge.

168
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,520
It's alright, Mom.

169
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,160
It's my fault I didn't tell you the truth.

170
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:12,600
I'm sorry, Mom.

171
00:19:17,320 --> 00:19:21,680
From now on, if you guys got anything, please tell us.

172
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:24,200
So we won't have to worry.

173
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,120
Of course.

174
00:19:28,320 --> 00:19:29,520
Yes.

175
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:35,120
I love you the most, Mom.

176
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:39,360
I love you too, Mom.

177
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:42,560
I love you too, Joe.

178
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
Even though I don't have her blood...

179
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,800
but this hug makes me realize...

180
00:19:53,800 --> 00:19:56,680
what motherly love...

181
00:19:56,680 --> 00:19:58,880
looks like.

182
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:17,080
It's good to be out here getting the fresh air.

183
00:20:17,080 --> 00:20:20,160
I've been in the room for almost a week.

184
00:20:20,160 --> 00:20:22,160
I'm so bored.

185
00:20:33,720 --> 00:20:35,960
Joe, a shooting star!

186
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:37,720
Where?

187
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,000
They said if you saw a shooting star, you can make a wish.

188
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:48,880
Wow, you're pretty superstitious.

189
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:51,160
Wait, you have a Master as your mentor...

190
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:53,160
and you say I'm superstitious?

191
00:20:59,560 --> 00:21:00,960
Joe, there it is again!

192
00:21:02,520 --> 00:21:04,520
Ming, I can't see it.

193
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:06,640
Let me help you with that.

194
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:18,280
There, you see it?

195
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:22,720
Make a wish.

196
00:21:52,800 --> 00:21:54,840
You said it's a superstition.

197
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:01,840
Well, I have something I wish too.

198
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:10,280
That'd be about me not disappearing again, right?

199
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,200
No.

200
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:19,920
So what is it?

201
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,240
You know,

202
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:28,160
Since you'd disappeared,

203
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:34,040
I prayed everyday...

204
00:22:34,040 --> 00:22:36,240
that I would see you again.

205
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:44,800
I didn't want you to come back.

206
00:22:46,680 --> 00:22:49,560
But I wanted a chance to apologize to you.

207
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:53,720
For everything that I'd done.

208
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:03,080
Joe.

209
00:23:09,880 --> 00:23:11,880
I'm really sorry.

210
00:23:14,680 --> 00:23:16,680
I'm sorry about everything.

211
00:23:20,160 --> 00:23:22,160
I'm sorry.

212
00:23:32,840 --> 00:23:34,600
Ming, you know,

213
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,680
being in this body,

214
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:43,360
it's not only your fault.

215
00:23:45,160 --> 00:23:47,880
It's because I chose to take that job.

216
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,480
So, stop blaming yourself, Ming.

217
00:23:53,960 --> 00:23:55,480
Alright, Ming?

218
00:23:56,400 --> 00:23:57,920
You know.

219
00:23:59,800 --> 00:24:01,800
So you forgive me?

220
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,400
Yes, I forgive you.

221
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:13,400
So, you need to forgive yourself too, you know.

222
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:16,440
Please.

223
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:23,560
Thank you, Joe.

224
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:29,560
Thank you, really.

225
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:09,920
Mr. Joe.

226
00:25:13,760 --> 00:25:16,840
Oh, where is Ming?

227
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,800
Mr. Ming is waiting for you downstairs.
He sent me to pick you up.

228
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:32,440
Ming told you to pick me up?

229
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,600
Yes.

230
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:48,000
Please get in the car.

231
00:25:49,480 --> 00:25:50,920
And where is Ming?

232
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:53,120
If Ming's not here, I'm not going.

233
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,600
Mr. Joe, please don't ask anything yet.

234
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,200
And follow me, please.

235
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,320
Where are you taking me?

236
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,480
Someone wants to talk to you.

237
00:26:40,560 --> 00:26:41,760
Yes.

238
00:27:08,680 --> 00:27:11,600
I heard that Mike offered you some money?

239
00:27:13,400 --> 00:27:15,000
Yes. / And why...

240
00:27:15,400 --> 00:27:17,760
my money couldn't buy you?

241
00:27:18,920 --> 00:27:22,920
Or...did Ming give you more?

242
00:27:25,640 --> 00:27:29,600
Sir, every Baht and Stang,

243
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:32,120
I'll return all to him.

244
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:34,200
Therefore, there's no need for you to worry.

245
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:36,280
What if I didn't buy you with money?

246
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:46,320
I can always make you disappear anytime.

247
00:27:47,040 --> 00:27:49,360
And no one can do me any harm.

248
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:54,560
Do you still wanna be with Ming after you learn about this?

249
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:01,200
My life...

250
00:28:02,160 --> 00:28:04,400
I got my Mom whom I need to take care of.

251
00:28:06,080 --> 00:28:08,760
And I believe that if I disappear,

252
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,160
Ming won't let my Mom in trouble no matter what.

253
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:15,280
And I almost died...

254
00:28:16,440 --> 00:28:18,600
But I returned to him anyway.

255
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:22,200
Because without him,

256
00:28:23,240 --> 00:28:26,000
I don't know what I'll be living for.

257
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:30,600
Do you know why I don't like you?

258
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,920
It's not because you're poor.

259
00:28:34,720 --> 00:28:37,200
It's not because you're a guy.

260
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,800
Your crazy love between you two,

261
00:28:40,760 --> 00:28:43,960
almost made me lose my son.

262
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:49,200
Before Ming got together with you,

263
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:52,520
he lost his loved one from an accident.

264
00:28:53,680 --> 00:28:55,440
He didn't eat.

265
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:57,960
He didn't come home.

266
00:29:02,280 --> 00:29:04,040
He just waited for him to return.

267
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:05,240
Joe.

268
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,320
Joe.

269
00:29:16,120 --> 00:29:17,800
Get him out of here.

270
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,120
C'mon, easy, easy...

271
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,640
I don't want my son to be sad like that again.

272
00:29:39,920 --> 00:29:42,200
Can you promise me...

273
00:29:42,720 --> 00:29:45,440
that you will not disappear

274
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,600
and not make my son sad like that again?

275
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:55,640
Yes, I promise you with my life.

276
00:30:16,280 --> 00:30:18,240
Joe gave me a promise.

277
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:25,760
So that means you allow us to be together?

278
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:28,880
I have so much work at the company.

279
00:30:28,880 --> 00:30:31,920
I don't have time for kids' love.

280
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:36,720
And there's one more thing.

281
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:38,120
I know that.

282
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:43,280
About your money and your business,

283
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,600
I'm too lazy to take care of it for you.

284
00:30:45,600 --> 00:30:47,960
Come and get your stuff back.

285
00:30:50,800 --> 00:30:53,400
Can I just ask for my money back?

286
00:30:53,400 --> 00:30:55,120
I'll give you my company.

287
00:30:55,120 --> 00:30:57,360
I'm too lazy to take care of it too.

288
00:30:58,720 --> 00:30:59,920
Ming!

289
00:30:59,920 --> 00:31:04,240
And May, even though they got the wrong guy,

290
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:07,520
but Tong was really in debt.

291
00:31:07,920 --> 00:31:11,760
Hey, I talked to Dad for you.

292
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,520
Dad's gonna pay for all the debts...

293
00:31:14,520 --> 00:31:17,640
as a baby showering gift.

294
00:31:22,640 --> 00:31:24,280
Thank you very much. / Thank you.

295
00:31:26,080 --> 00:31:30,600
But this will be the last amount of money that I give you.

296
00:31:31,720 --> 00:31:34,320
You promised that you're gonna take care of May.

297
00:31:35,160 --> 00:31:36,920
Can you remember?

298
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,960
Yes, I can. I'm sorry.

299
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,800
And you too, Joe.

300
00:31:51,400 --> 00:31:53,960
If you break our promise,

301
00:31:53,960 --> 00:31:56,440
we'll see each other again for sure.

302
00:31:58,320 --> 00:31:59,520
Yes, sir.

303
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:02,600
Alright, let's eat.

304
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:06,160
Let's eat.

305
00:32:33,560 --> 00:32:35,160
Wrap it for Dad too.

306
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:51,200
Do you know about them taking me...

307
00:32:51,200 --> 00:32:53,200
from the hospital?

308
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,160
I was dragged out of my bed too.

309
00:33:15,280 --> 00:33:19,400
Thank you, Joe, for switching with me.

310
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:24,240
Thank you for everything.

311
00:33:25,200 --> 00:33:27,480
About the movie credit,

312
00:33:27,480 --> 00:33:29,480
I'll put your name back on.

313
00:33:29,480 --> 00:33:32,640
That's alright. I just wanna help your son.

314
00:33:36,040 --> 00:33:39,560
Ming, I always thought...

315
00:33:39,560 --> 00:33:44,880
when my lovely little brother will be back...

316
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:47,640
But I didn't realize that...

317
00:33:47,640 --> 00:33:52,640
actually, the one who's changed...

318
00:33:53,960 --> 00:33:55,960
is me.

319
00:33:55,960 --> 00:33:58,240
Someone gave me a second chance.

320
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:02,720
So I think...you deserve a second chance too.

321
00:34:03,800 --> 00:34:05,720
Just don't repeat the same mistake.

322
00:34:25,880 --> 00:34:27,280
I'm gonna get going.

323
00:34:27,920 --> 00:34:30,080
Are you gonna go alone?

324
00:34:30,080 --> 00:34:33,639
And how about what you told Dad
that you're gonna take care of me?

325
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,239
But the divorce paper...

326
00:34:39,239 --> 00:34:41,239
I didn't sign it.

327
00:34:41,920 --> 00:34:45,719
I know that you rushed me during that time...

328
00:34:45,960 --> 00:34:48,960
was because you were afraid that
I would get sued too, right?

329
00:34:52,520 --> 00:34:56,239
You used to ask me if one day,

330
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:58,640
you didn't have money,

331
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,120
would I still love you?

332
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,920
I'd like to know too.

333
00:35:06,200 --> 00:35:11,840
If one day, I'm not famous anymore,

334
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:14,960
and no one cares for me anymore,

335
00:35:16,080 --> 00:35:18,080
will you still wanna be with me?

336
00:35:18,280 --> 00:35:20,480
I don't want to have a celebrity boyfriend.

337
00:35:21,400 --> 00:35:25,280
He's always busy, and it's hard for us to go somewhere.

338
00:35:26,120 --> 00:35:31,320
But I'm okay with that
because I know that you love this job so much.

339
00:35:43,880 --> 00:35:46,880
But what I love the most is...

340
00:35:47,280 --> 00:35:49,280
you, May.

341
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,200
That's not enough.

342
00:35:54,600 --> 00:35:57,040
There's one more person now.

343
00:36:09,720 --> 00:36:11,680
Thank you very much.

344
00:36:25,240 --> 00:36:27,640
Well, Dad gave you all your stuff back.

345
00:36:27,640 --> 00:36:30,280
Do I need to give you back your secretary?

346
00:36:31,120 --> 00:36:33,720
I think you need to ask him that.

347
00:36:34,760 --> 00:36:37,880
So? Do you wanna be with Mike?

348
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:44,600
Well, technically, I am Mr. Ming's secretary,
so I must go back.

349
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,040
Well, may I have him?

350
00:36:51,720 --> 00:36:55,240
You already have Joe to take care of you.

351
00:36:55,240 --> 00:36:57,520
But I got no one yet.

352
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,600
Do you wanna come take care of me?

353
00:37:06,280 --> 00:37:07,480
Hey!

354
00:37:07,760 --> 00:37:08,960
Okay.

355
00:37:09,960 --> 00:37:11,160
Alright...

356
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:14,680
then give me ride.

357
00:37:14,680 --> 00:37:15,880
With pleasure.

358
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,840
But I'll drive.

359
00:37:45,840 --> 00:37:49,520
I guess, today's mission is complete.

360
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,240
Not yet, there's one more thing I need to handle.

361
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:04,400
I've decided that I want to play in this movie.

362
00:38:04,400 --> 00:38:07,800
Then shall we talk about the timeline?

363
00:38:07,800 --> 00:38:08,840
Of course.

364
00:38:08,840 --> 00:38:13,080
But before that, I got two conditions.

365
00:38:13,080 --> 00:38:15,880
First, I'd like to choose the director on my own.

366
00:38:15,880 --> 00:38:17,960
I'll send you the profiles of each director but I guarantee...

367
00:38:17,960 --> 00:38:20,480
he will be suitable for this movie.

368
00:38:20,480 --> 00:38:22,240
And your second condition?

369
00:38:22,240 --> 00:38:26,240
The second one is I'd like to go to
an audition like the other actors.

370
00:38:26,840 --> 00:38:29,040
But the director must not know

371
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:31,640
that I'm involved in the production of this movie.

372
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:37,000
What if he doesn't choose you?

373
00:38:37,320 --> 00:38:39,560
Well, I'm gonna lose the chance to play in the movie.

374
00:38:39,560 --> 00:38:41,360
But Ming, don't you worry.

375
00:38:41,360 --> 00:38:43,720
Because I'll make him choose me, definitely.

376
00:38:57,880 --> 00:39:00,680
Congrats on your audition!

377
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,520
From now on, you're gonna be a star.

378
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:06,040
Not a stuntman like us.

379
00:39:06,040 --> 00:39:09,960
Hey, let me tell you something.
No matter what you do,

380
00:39:09,960 --> 00:39:12,040
you can spread happiness to other people too.

381
00:39:12,040 --> 00:39:14,280
But the payment isn't the same...

382
00:39:14,280 --> 00:39:15,480
Yes!

383
00:39:18,680 --> 00:39:20,560
If you want more,

384
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,720
go practice!

385
00:39:23,320 --> 00:39:24,840
go practice! Now!

386
00:39:24,840 --> 00:39:26,040
Alright.

387
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:30,400
Assholes...

388
00:39:36,120 --> 00:39:37,120
Hello.

389
00:39:37,120 --> 00:39:38,320
Hey.

390
00:39:41,200 --> 00:39:44,040
I have something to tell you.

391
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,240
Tell or confess?

392
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:53,000
Well, confess.

393
00:39:55,720 --> 00:39:58,160
Ming and I, we're officially together.

394
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,360
I'm sorry.

395
00:40:01,080 --> 00:40:03,960
Damn you, you're still the same.

396
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:06,160
Next time, if you got something,

397
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,800
don't spend a night at my place again.

398
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,800
No more, Wut.

399
00:40:11,480 --> 00:40:15,480
But I wish you lots of happiness.

400
00:40:15,480 --> 00:40:17,480
You're my bro.

401
00:40:18,600 --> 00:40:20,600
Thank you very much, Wut.

402
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:24,840
But now, there's another bro to worry about.

403
00:40:30,080 --> 00:40:33,600
See ya. Thank you all very much.

404
00:40:33,600 --> 00:40:34,880
See you in korea.

405
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:37,360
Of course, come see me, alright?

406
00:40:37,360 --> 00:40:38,560
Bye-bye.

407
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:58,160
Sol, Wut told me you're gonna go back to Korea?

408
00:40:58,160 --> 00:41:00,280
Is that because of me?

409
00:41:00,280 --> 00:41:03,960
Well, both of you are very sweet. How can I stand that?

410
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,960
I'm sorry.

411
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:09,400
Hey, it's not your fault.

412
00:41:09,840 --> 00:41:11,960
I just wanna move on, you know.

413
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:16,240
Then take a good care of yourself, alright?

414
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:18,280
You can call me anytime.

415
00:41:19,360 --> 00:41:21,920
You will always be my little brother.

416
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:26,480
I wish you happiness, Joe.

417
00:41:26,480 --> 00:41:28,120
The reason I'm okay to go back to Korea

418
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,520
because I know that he'll make you happy.

419
00:41:32,920 --> 00:41:34,160
Thanks.

420
00:41:36,360 --> 00:41:38,200
And when are you leaving?

421
00:41:38,200 --> 00:41:40,480
I'll clear my schedule and send you off.

422
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:46,800
In a while. I'll let you know soon.

423
00:42:14,120 --> 00:42:15,440
See ya.

424
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:50,160
Are you going to the airport?

425
00:42:50,560 --> 00:42:52,520
How did you know that I'd leave today?

426
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:55,160
I'm in your secret fans chat group.

427
00:42:55,480 --> 00:42:58,120
There's nothing that your fandom doesn't know.

428
00:42:58,640 --> 00:42:59,840
Like what?

429
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:04,520
If you wanna know, get in. I'll give you a ride.

430
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,520
At first, I called a taxi, but it was taken away.

431
00:43:13,120 --> 00:43:16,760
I'll just try getting in a fan's car. It might be good too.

432
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,800
Why are you back here so early, babe?

433
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:11,040
Mom!

434
00:44:13,960 --> 00:44:15,600
Why didn't you tell me that you were coming.

435
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:18,560
If I told you first, I wouldn't see

436
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,080
how you live together.

437
00:44:26,920 --> 00:44:29,520
Isn't this place too old and shabby for you?

438
00:44:32,240 --> 00:44:37,120
I think you both made quite lots of money.
You can live better than this.

439
00:44:38,520 --> 00:44:39,720
That's true, Mom.

440
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,960
But for both of us,

441
00:44:42,960 --> 00:44:45,320
this house got so many memories,

442
00:44:45,320 --> 00:44:47,320
that no other houses can replace them.

443
00:44:47,600 --> 00:44:49,160
But I think... / Mom.

444
00:44:50,840 --> 00:44:53,400
I'm happy living in this house.

445
00:44:54,920 --> 00:44:56,640
That, I see.

446
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,800
At least, if you have someone to take care of you,

447
00:44:59,800 --> 00:45:00,960
it might be better.

448
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:02,880
How about this? I'll call Secretary Jim.

449
00:45:02,880 --> 00:45:04,880
Mom, Mom! It's alright.

450
00:45:06,360 --> 00:45:09,360
He's happy now. Don't disturb him.

451
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,200
Are you sick?

452
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:23,880
Come here, sit here.

453
00:45:32,040 --> 00:45:34,600
You're red. You want to rest?

454
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,160
It's alright, I'm okay.

455
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:48,760
But you're so so red, non-stop.

456
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,680
Joe, actually, I can live in a smaller house.

457
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:03,200
You don't have to...

458
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:06,000
Mom, Mom! Don't worry about it.

459
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:08,440
You've been so tired enough already.

460
00:46:08,440 --> 00:46:12,200
And this is what you deserve.

461
00:46:13,880 --> 00:46:17,000
Today, I got great news to tell you.

462
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:18,480
What great news?

463
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,920
The doctor said someone gave me a kidney.

464
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:23,120
Really, Mom?

465
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:28,360
I'm so happy to hear that!

466
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:33,840
Mom, I actually have great news to tell you too.

467
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,960
If it's about you being the main lead, you don't have to...

468
00:46:37,960 --> 00:46:40,000
Wut's already told me that.

469
00:46:40,000 --> 00:46:42,080
No, it's not about that.

470
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:46,000
Well, Ming and I...

471
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:48,160
we are officially together now.

472
00:46:49,360 --> 00:46:53,840
But I don't know if this is considered
great news to you too.

473
00:46:53,840 --> 00:46:56,800
My son getting to be with the one he loves and vice versa,

474
00:46:56,800 --> 00:46:59,600
that's great news, of course.

475
00:46:59,600 --> 00:47:01,320
Thank you, Mom.

476
00:47:02,760 --> 00:47:04,560
I love you so much, Mom.

477
00:47:06,840 --> 00:47:13,040
Mom, you know...I wouldn't be here today
if it weren't for you.

478
00:47:13,480 --> 00:47:16,640
Mmm, I love you too, Joe.

479
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:36,040
Wow, what a smell!

480
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:38,360
What are you cooking, babe?

481
00:47:38,840 --> 00:47:41,280
Jaew-Hon, babe.

482
00:47:42,760 --> 00:47:43,760
Mom!

483
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,400
Hello.

484
00:47:45,400 --> 00:47:46,680
Hello there.

485
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:53,840
Would you like me to cut the veggies?

486
00:47:53,840 --> 00:47:55,200
It's alright, Mom.

487
00:47:59,360 --> 00:48:01,480
Is it a trick? / Yes.

488
00:48:05,560 --> 00:48:07,680
Is it a vegetable? / Put it in.

489
00:48:08,320 --> 00:48:09,520
Will smell good

490
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:11,520
You the best

491
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:13,240
Praise your son

492
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:19,640
Wow.

493
00:48:23,520 --> 00:48:24,680
Here, Mom.

494
00:48:42,200 --> 00:48:43,440
Try it first.

495
00:48:45,640 --> 00:48:48,960
Wow, my son knows how to cook.

496
00:48:51,760 --> 00:48:54,640
Ming's cooking has improved a lot, Mom.

497
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,320
Why don't you cook for me?

498
00:48:57,320 --> 00:48:59,840
I'm getting jealous of Joe.

499
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:03,400
I'm sorry, Mom.

500
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:05,480
I'm just kidding.

501
00:49:05,480 --> 00:49:08,920
If it weren't for you, Joe. Ming? Cooking? No way!

502
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,160
I must thank you, Joe.

503
00:49:11,160 --> 00:49:12,760
There's no need, Mom.

504
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:15,120
Then, please eat a lot.

505
00:49:17,600 --> 00:49:18,800
Thank you.

506
00:49:20,240 --> 00:49:21,440
Right, Mom.

507
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,560
We got one bottle of wine here, interested?

508
00:49:29,080 --> 00:49:32,680
Ming, how could you say that to your mother?

509
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,320
Go get it!

510
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:35,720
Mom!

511
00:49:36,320 --> 00:49:38,840
I haven't had a night out for a long time.

512
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:40,400
Don't tell Dad, alright?

513
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:41,600
Alright.

514
00:49:42,480 --> 00:49:43,160
Eat.

515
00:49:43,160 --> 00:49:44,720
Yes, I will. Thank you.

516
00:49:45,320 --> 00:49:46,800
Full bottle here.

517
00:49:58,320 --> 00:50:00,080
You're only doing this for others. Why don't you eat?

518
00:50:00,080 --> 00:50:02,320
Let me help you first.

519
00:50:03,160 --> 00:50:04,160
Thank you.

520
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:07,240
Let's do it?

521
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:08,440
C'mon!

522
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,200
Wow, so crispy.

523
00:50:20,600 --> 00:50:22,040
Did you make the sauce yourself?

524
00:50:22,040 --> 00:50:23,920
Of course. / Oh, wow!

525
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,160
It's yummy, isn't it?

526
00:50:32,880 --> 00:50:33,760
Is it?

527
00:50:33,760 --> 00:50:34,840
Yes!

528
00:50:47,880 --> 00:50:50,000
Yim, have you seen Joe?

529
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:51,520
The press conference is about to start.

530
00:50:51,520 --> 00:50:52,360
I haven't seen him.

531
00:50:55,040 --> 00:50:57,760
Wut, I'm sorry.

532
00:50:57,760 --> 00:51:00,080
I'm really sorry, I...

533
00:51:00,080 --> 00:51:03,560
Hey, is there anything?

534
00:51:04,880 --> 00:51:06,560
No, nothing.

535
00:51:06,560 --> 00:51:08,880
Well, Joe was so nervous that he couldn't sleep.

536
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:10,200
He fell asleep in the morning.

537
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,720
I couldn't wake him up.

538
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:15,480
Damn you, I thought something happened.

539
00:51:15,480 --> 00:51:18,160
C'mon, let's get your hair and make-up done first.

540
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:19,680
Hurry up! / Sorry.

541
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:21,320
I'll leave him to you. I'll go get something else done first.

542
00:51:21,320 --> 00:51:22,360
Alright.

543
00:51:25,800 --> 00:51:28,560
Really? Where did you go last night?

544
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:30,280
Nowhere.

545
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,360
Hey, come on. Hurry up!

546
00:52:00,280 --> 00:52:02,000
Don't be nervous.

547
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:06,000
How could I not be?

548
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:09,680
This is the first time...

549
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,080
that I don't show my back to the audience.

550
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:17,680
Okay?

551
00:52:20,120 --> 00:52:20,960
Pao, hello.

552
00:52:20,960 --> 00:52:22,040
Hello. Hello.

553
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:24,400
Hey, Joe, let me ask you this.

554
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:25,040
Yes.

555
00:52:25,040 --> 00:52:26,800
When you came in for an audition...

556
00:52:26,800 --> 00:52:28,200
why didn't you tell me that

557
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:29,880
Mr. Ming is the producer of this movie?

558
00:52:33,160 --> 00:52:35,880
I wanted you to choose me for my talent.

559
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:41,400
I chose you

560
00:52:42,120 --> 00:52:45,200
because you reminded me of someone.

561
00:52:46,480 --> 00:52:49,400
He was about to become a star.

562
00:52:50,040 --> 00:52:53,600
He and I were about to work together.

563
00:52:55,200 --> 00:52:59,080
But it's a pity that it never happened.

564
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:02,240
Man, it's the only thing...

565
00:53:02,240 --> 00:53:04,760
that makes me sad until today.

566
00:53:10,200 --> 00:53:12,200
Thank you for choosing me.

567
00:53:18,000 --> 00:53:20,160
Joe. Pao. Stand by, please.

568
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:21,960
Alright.

569
00:53:33,960 --> 00:53:35,640
At last,

570
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,360
our dream

571
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:39,280
is about to come true.

572
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:40,680
Joe, please.

573
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:43,120
This way.

574
00:53:43,120 --> 00:53:44,320
Alright.

575
00:54:04,320 --> 00:54:07,080
How is working together like?

576
00:54:07,080 --> 00:54:09,520
Well, we've both just worked together for the first time.

577
00:54:09,520 --> 00:54:11,440
But I'm so happy.

578
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:13,160
Pao is such a great talent.

579
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,400
He has the clear picture in his head.

580
00:54:15,400 --> 00:54:17,960
Actually, this is my first time working with Joe too.

581
00:54:17,960 --> 00:54:19,480
But I must say this...

582
00:54:19,480 --> 00:54:22,120
he's going to be a top superstar in this industry for sure.

583
00:54:22,120 --> 00:54:23,840
Thank you very much.

584
00:54:23,840 --> 00:54:26,200
And this movie is going to...

585
00:54:26,200 --> 00:54:31,080
So the feeling of being in the light on the stage...

586
00:54:31,080 --> 00:54:33,080
is like this...

587
00:55:06,120 --> 00:55:08,480
All the time that I'm watching the movie,

588
00:55:08,960 --> 00:55:11,520
I don't see the movie like the other people.

589
00:55:12,080 --> 00:55:14,240
I see the old pictures...

590
00:55:14,920 --> 00:55:17,520
when the light hasn't shone on me yet.

591
00:55:39,840 --> 00:55:40,520
Cut!

592
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:41,240
Action!

593
00:55:41,240 --> 00:55:41,920
Action!

594
00:55:55,880 --> 00:55:57,640
Ready, action!

595
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,160
Thanks...

596
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,240
that I didn't give up...

597
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,120
that day.

598
00:56:58,560 --> 00:57:02,120
I've just known that promoting a movie is so tiring.

599
00:57:07,080 --> 00:57:10,560
The real deal is when you have to promote it on TV shows.

600
00:57:11,080 --> 00:57:14,960
I've experienced it when I first played the movie for Tong.

601
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:18,840
Then can I go back to be a stunt now?

602
00:57:19,400 --> 00:57:20,600
Too late.

603
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:25,480
I'm hungry!

604
00:57:25,480 --> 00:57:27,800
What? There are lots of food at the conference.

605
00:57:27,800 --> 00:57:29,200
Didn't you grab something to eat?

606
00:57:30,160 --> 00:57:32,720
Ming, I was doing so many interviews.

607
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:34,480
I had no time to eat.

608
00:57:34,960 --> 00:57:36,800
And what do you wanna eat?

609
00:57:38,560 --> 00:57:40,080
At this time,

610
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,480
there's only one thing...

611
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,200
It's yummy.

612
00:57:54,560 --> 00:57:56,320
I still can't beat you.

613
00:58:01,560 --> 00:58:04,040
At the conference, there were dishes by Michelin Chefs.

614
00:58:04,400 --> 00:58:05,720
But instead, you wanted to eat

615
00:58:05,720 --> 00:58:07,960
instant noodles with canned fish?

616
00:58:08,960 --> 00:58:12,120
This kind of thing, it depends on whom you're eating with.

617
00:58:14,240 --> 00:58:18,320
So sweet, but you'll forget me when you get famous.

618
00:58:26,360 --> 00:58:28,080
Ming, you know,

619
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:31,000
although how much I'm happy today...

620
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:36,840
right now, I'm happiest.

621
00:58:43,480 --> 00:58:46,320
Then will you continue the contract?

622
00:58:46,320 --> 00:58:47,840
What contract?

623
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:55,440
The contract that I rented you for a year.

624
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,680
Actually, it's been expired for a while now.

625
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:03,680
But I've seen you busy with work
so I didn't want to interupt.

626
00:59:18,840 --> 00:59:20,040
Joe.

627
00:59:24,880 --> 00:59:27,640
There's no contract holding you back anymore.

628
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:31,720
Do you still want to be with me?

629
01:00:05,240 --> 01:00:09,440
I still think about...what brought me back.

630
01:00:11,200 --> 01:00:13,200
This world is so big.

631
01:00:14,760 --> 01:00:16,800
And I still came back to see Wut.

632
01:00:18,400 --> 01:00:20,480
What a coincidence.

633
01:00:32,320 --> 01:00:34,200
So how do you think of it?

634
01:00:37,120 --> 01:00:38,320
I don't know about that too.

635
01:00:39,880 --> 01:00:41,720
But no matter what,

636
01:00:44,320 --> 01:00:46,800
I'd like to start over with you again, Ming.

637
01:00:48,840 --> 01:00:50,800
And if I lose again this time,

638
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:55,320
I don't know what to say anymore.

639
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:15,200
Joe.

640
01:01:17,560 --> 01:01:19,440
Let's start all over again.

641
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,680
And this time,

642
01:01:25,960 --> 01:01:27,960
I'm holding the right person.

643
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,000
Let's start all over again.

644
01:02:13,120 --> 01:02:15,520
And from now on,

645
01:02:15,520 --> 01:02:18,120
you don't have to do from the back anymore.

646
01:02:22,320 --> 01:02:24,800
Hey, Ming. Wait, Ming.

647
01:02:24,800 --> 01:02:26,640
Ming. Ming!

648
01:02:30,280 --> 01:02:31,640
Right here?

649
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:39,880
You can't stop me.

650
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:35,560
Ming! Ming! Ming! Ming! Ming!
