1
00:01:36,440 --> 00:01:37,440
Come in.

2
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:48,160
I'm sorry to bother you, Mike.

3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,440
If this is about your boss, leave me out of it.

4
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:53,880
This time, he's on his own.

5
00:01:57,080 --> 00:01:59,759
I don't really understand too.

6
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,080
But Mr. Ming says if something like this happens,

7
00:02:04,080 --> 00:02:07,280
he asks me to inform you about the promise you gave him.

8
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,720
Happy birthday to you, happy birthday to you.

9
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,880
Happy birthday, happy birthday...

10
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,640
Happy birthday to you.

11
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,560
Happy birthday, Mom.

12
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:43,160
Thank you so much.

13
00:02:43,160 --> 00:02:44,000
Of course.

14
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,120
And,

15
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,040
thank you too, Sol, for getting me a birthday cake.

16
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:52,760
Please eat a lot.

17
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:55,040
This foy-thong cake is very famous. Many celebs buy it.

18
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:56,640
And they must wait for the order for a year.

19
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:01,640
Then, let's eat.

20
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:02,560
Alright.

21
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:05,400
Sol, I'll get you some.

22
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:06,200
Thank you.

23
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:07,640
Thank you so much, Sol,

24
00:03:07,640 --> 00:03:10,080
for coming to my Mom's birthday party.

25
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,000
Since you came here,

26
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,960
my Mom had been much happier.

27
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:18,720
I had a lot of fun too.

28
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,720
How about you? Did you have fun?

29
00:03:23,520 --> 00:03:26,400
Yes.

30
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,400
But I've been tired lately.

31
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:34,160
It's an important day for your Mom.

32
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,160
He'll never let me be with you alone for sure.

33
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,880
Did you guys have a fight?

34
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:49,600
He's been trying to get back together with me.

35
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,720
So his family isn't very happy about that.

36
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,920
So I kinda leave some space.

37
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:01,800
I've always known that you like him.

38
00:04:03,880 --> 00:04:04,840
When you told me

39
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:07,600
that you weren't getting back together with him,

40
00:04:07,600 --> 00:04:09,600
I knew that you wouldn't be able to do it anyhow.

41
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:19,000
I didn't know about that too, Sol.

42
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:22,280
I didn't know why I could be so...foolish.

43
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:26,520
Well, same here.

44
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:30,240
I still can't get over you...

45
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:37,320
even though I know that you're only seeing me as...

46
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:40,120
your brother.

47
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:52,120
The reason I'm saying this is because I mean you well.

48
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,400
He and you live in different worlds.

49
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,440
If you keep pushing, you'll get hurt, both of you.

50
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,120
I'm just worried about him.

51
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:08,560
He's been gone all week.

52
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,160
And I couldn't reach him at all.

53
00:05:14,480 --> 00:05:17,960
If you have things on your mind, you can always talk to me.

54
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,200
Don't put it on your shoulders.

55
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,760
Anyhow, we're like brothers.

56
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:28,720
Come here.

57
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,920
I'm gonna go home now.

58
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:46,400
Safe travels.

59
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,800
I'm waiting for you at your place.

60
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:41,440
Ming.

61
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:51,280
Ming!

62
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,440
I'm the one who called you here.

63
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:08,880
If you're gonna ask me where Ming is,

64
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:10,480
I don't know about that.

65
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:12,840
That, I know.

66
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:16,120
Right now, Ming is locked up in the house.

67
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,680
Because he told Dad that he's dating you.

68
00:07:21,640 --> 00:07:23,520
About Ming's personal stuff,

69
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,880
our family knows about it a bit.

70
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,640
But this is the first time Ming dared tell Dad directly.

71
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:39,520
So the reason you're here is...

72
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
trying to convince me to break up with him, right?

73
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,000
I can prevent you two

74
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:45,520
from seeing each other for the rest of your lives.

75
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:49,520
But doing such a thing, Ming will hate me.

76
00:07:50,440 --> 00:07:52,920
I know that you're a reasonable person.

77
00:07:52,920 --> 00:07:54,920
So shall we find a new agreement?

78
00:07:56,480 --> 00:08:00,000
I admit that I needed the money.

79
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:02,040
But not much that I'd make him sad.

80
00:08:02,040 --> 00:08:05,040
So you think my brother loves you so much, huh?

81
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,920
Before, Ming used to fall in love with a guy,

82
00:08:09,920 --> 00:08:11,440
same name as you.

83
00:08:12,640 --> 00:08:15,040
And then he moved on to you.

84
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:16,720
So that means one day,

85
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,280
Ming may change his mind from you too.

86
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:24,400
I don't know how to explain this to you.

87
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:26,200
But no matter what, you won't understand both of us anyway.

88
00:08:26,200 --> 00:08:28,400
Althought it won't be like that,

89
00:08:30,040 --> 00:08:34,240
in the future, our family will push Ming harder.

90
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,080
You understand that, right?

91
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,080
And in the end, they will force you two to break up anyway.

92
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:47,000
The sooner it ends,

93
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,280
the sooner you two won't waste your time.

94
00:08:59,280 --> 00:09:00,280
Then, okay.

95
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:03,680
I'll break up with Ming.

96
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:06,840
But I must be the one who tells him that.

97
00:09:06,840 --> 00:09:11,680
Sorry, my Dad won't let you two see each other.

98
00:09:13,880 --> 00:09:15,880
That means you will let me disappear from his life...

99
00:09:15,880 --> 00:09:17,880
without any explanation?

100
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,200
You want me to disappear like the old Joe?

101
00:09:25,520 --> 00:09:28,080
If you can convince me,

102
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:33,360
I think you may be able to convince your Dad too.

103
00:09:35,520 --> 00:09:36,520
Thank you.

104
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:53,240
Mr. Joe, there's a trouble.

105
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,720
When you were out, someone came to see Mrs. Ing.

106
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:59,120
Why don't you go talk to her?

107
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:01,120
Alright. What's wrong?

108
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:10,640
Mom, are you alright?

109
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:13,040
A lawyer came to see me.

110
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:15,040
He gave me this.

111
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,640
You told me that he lent you the money to pay off the debts.

112
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:38,480
But the contract says you will be his paramore for one year.

113
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:41,120
This is not an ordinary loan agreement.

114
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:41,800
Mom.

115
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,800
Mom, listen to me first. I can explain.

116
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:44,800
Joe!

117
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,320
Stop talking! I'm not a fool.

118
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:53,920
I don't understand why you agreed to this.

119
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:56,080
Even if I had to die,

120
00:10:56,080 --> 00:10:59,360
i would never want my son to get the money this way.

121
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,280
Mom, I'm sorry.

122
00:11:01,280 --> 00:11:03,520
But please, let me explain first.

123
00:11:03,520 --> 00:11:04,320
Mom!

124
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:05,880
I don't want to live in this house.

125
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:07,520
I'm not gonna live in this house anymore because...

126
00:11:07,520 --> 00:11:09,240
this is not ours!

127
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,000
I'm going to live with Auntie Nual.

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:12,560
Mom!

129
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:16,640
Once you pay off all the debts, you can see me.

130
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:24,200
Mom! Mom, Mom, Mom, please listen to me first, Mom!

131
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:56,200
What's up?

132
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:58,360
Mike, why did you do it?

133
00:11:58,360 --> 00:11:59,760
I respected you.

134
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,160
My mom has nothing to do with this.

135
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,960
Someone came over to see your Mom?

136
00:12:04,960 --> 00:12:07,520
If it's not you, then who could it be?

137
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,080
I would never use that lame trick.

138
00:12:11,080 --> 00:12:13,320
I'll look into this for you.

139
00:12:13,320 --> 00:12:15,920
And how can I trust you?

140
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,440
How about this, as an apology,

141
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:23,160
I'll take you to see Ming.

142
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:20,680
You can still change your mind now.

143
00:13:23,280 --> 00:13:25,280
What if it were you, would you change your mind?

144
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,400
I'm not going in.

145
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,360
There are still lots of good people

146
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:31,760
to be with and you won't get a headache.

147
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:33,360
But I know that you can't do it.

148
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,200
Ming hasn't eaten anything for a week now.

149
00:13:51,200 --> 00:13:53,000
Mom's very worried.

150
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,360
They're stubborn, both Dad and Son.

151
00:13:56,360 --> 00:13:59,640
So this game, the soft one will lose.

152
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:04,320
This game...which side are you on?

153
00:14:07,640 --> 00:14:09,520
I'm not siding up with anyone.

154
00:14:10,480 --> 00:14:13,160
If it's not for the goddamn promise.

155
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:15,960
Ming's here.

156
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:32,080
Ming.

157
00:14:33,280 --> 00:14:34,480
How are you doing, Ming?

158
00:14:36,040 --> 00:14:37,240
Joe.

159
00:14:45,560 --> 00:14:49,760
Just seeing you, I'm okay now.

160
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:54,800
We don't have much time.

161
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:56,280
Our parents will be back soon.

162
00:14:56,280 --> 00:14:58,640
Clear the things you need to first.

163
00:15:06,200 --> 00:15:08,960
Well...

164
00:15:08,960 --> 00:15:11,840
Someone came to tell my Mom about our contract.

165
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:17,640
They wanted us to separate.

166
00:15:18,520 --> 00:15:21,040
No matter what, they won't let us be together, Ming.

167
00:15:25,200 --> 00:15:26,400
No, Joe!

168
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:30,480
I'm not going to break up with you.

169
00:15:32,320 --> 00:15:33,520
Ming.

170
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:40,000
But if you don't have me,

171
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,880
your life will be so much better.

172
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:50,440
But if I don't have you in my life,

173
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:53,280
I don't know for whom I'll live.

174
00:15:54,960 --> 00:15:55,840
But your family...

175
00:15:55,840 --> 00:15:57,040
Joe.

176
00:15:58,720 --> 00:16:02,920
About that, Mike will help us.

177
00:16:04,200 --> 00:16:06,200
He gave me a promise.

178
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:13,680
Yes, I promised that if the old Joe was back,

179
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:16,160
I would help you two be together.

180
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:18,080
And what does this have to do with that?

181
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:34,000
Well, who you're seeing in front of you right now...

182
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:35,800
is the old Joe.

183
00:16:37,320 --> 00:16:40,680
Have you gone nuts because you didn't eat anything?

184
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:44,200
I'm not kidding.

185
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:47,280
Do you remember what the Master said?

186
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:54,800
The Master said Joe wasn't dead...

187
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:56,800
but he wasn't really alive either.

188
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:00,760
That's right.

189
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:04,680
Because Joe came back into this new body instead.

190
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:07,319
That's nonsense. Who would believe such a thing?

191
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:09,760
I know that we can't prove anything now.

192
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:13,920
But I know that some day you'll believe me.

193
00:17:20,640 --> 00:17:21,440
Oh, Dad!

194
00:17:24,119 --> 00:17:27,119
Mike, who let him in?

195
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:27,920
I'm sorry.

196
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,120
Dad, don't!

197
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:31,560
Mom!

198
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:33,200
Ming, Ming!

199
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:34,360
That's enough! That's enough!

200
00:17:34,360 --> 00:17:35,440
Dad!

201
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:36,920
Oh, that's it, that's enough.

202
00:17:36,920 --> 00:17:38,400
Mom!

203
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:39,120
Dad! Dad!

204
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,920
Ming, Ming, Ming!

205
00:17:41,920 --> 00:17:42,960
Dad, stop it!

206
00:17:45,080 --> 00:17:47,840
Ming, Ming, Ming!

207
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,840
Ming!

208
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:49,600
Ming! / Ming!

209
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:52,000
Ming, Ming!

210
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,800
What are you standing there for? Call an ambulance!

211
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:59,040
Ming, how are you doing, sweetie?

212
00:17:59,040 --> 00:18:00,240
Ming, Ming!

213
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,240
Ming!

214
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:02,920
Ming, are you alright?

215
00:18:02,920 --> 00:18:06,880
Ming, are you alright? Ming!

216
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,000
Ming, are you alright? Ming!

217
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,360
There are only us. You can stop acting now.

218
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,440
Wow, you know me.

219
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:03,200
What does it mean?

220
00:19:05,200 --> 00:19:07,080
That vomitting was an act?

221
00:19:07,080 --> 00:19:10,560
If I didn't do it, would we be able to get here?

222
00:19:11,800 --> 00:19:14,200
I knew it. You let Dad lock you up on purpose.

223
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:18,160
And you knew that Dad wouldn't be soft.

224
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:20,520
But it's the only way...

225
00:19:21,080 --> 00:19:23,360
that will drag you into this.

226
00:19:25,160 --> 00:19:29,240
Ming, but not eating anything for a week, that's too much.

227
00:19:30,600 --> 00:19:34,240
If I didn't do this, would Mike believe me

228
00:19:34,240 --> 00:19:36,480
that he's really Joe?

229
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:41,080
Because there's only one Joe...

230
00:19:41,080 --> 00:19:43,120
who would make me this way.

231
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,120
I've called and checked with the Master already.

232
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,080
Wow, I gotta believe it.

233
00:19:52,480 --> 00:19:55,920
I guess I have to keep my word.

234
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:58,120
Thanks.

235
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:02,520
If you just help me with that, I'll be fine.

236
00:20:02,520 --> 00:20:05,320
Hey, but I'm not promising anything here...

237
00:20:05,320 --> 00:20:07,400
And I'll have to borrow your secretary.

238
00:20:09,160 --> 00:20:10,200
Me?

239
00:20:13,040 --> 00:20:17,040
This job needs you to deal with every connection that we got.

240
00:20:21,800 --> 00:20:23,400
It will be burdensome.

241
00:20:25,680 --> 00:20:26,880
With pleasure, sir.

242
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:37,080
What you did was too much, Ming.

243
00:20:42,920 --> 00:20:46,280
And, what will you have Mike do?

244
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:53,840
I'll have him collect the weapons to defeat my Dad.

245
00:21:20,360 --> 00:21:21,560
I'm hungry now.

246
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:24,920
What do you wanna eat? I'll order it.

247
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:39,200
Can I have more chicken?

248
00:21:41,360 --> 00:21:42,360
Okay.

249
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:45,120
Not that one, the other one.

250
00:21:45,720 --> 00:21:49,720
Hey, you can eat by yourself.

251
00:21:50,120 --> 00:21:51,920
Your arm is okay, right?

252
00:21:53,040 --> 00:21:55,040
I can eat myself and I'll get full.

253
00:21:55,960 --> 00:21:57,800
But if you feed me, my heart is fulfilled.

254
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,320
Where did you get that?

255
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:02,760
From you.

256
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,320
You've leveled up now.

257
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:07,760
Can you feed me now?

258
00:22:18,280 --> 00:22:19,480
Mom.

259
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:24,040
No, please sit.

260
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,640
If you don't feed him, he wouldn't eat anything for days.

261
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:32,880
Sit down.

262
00:22:37,520 --> 00:22:40,640
I'm okay now, Mom. I'm okay.

263
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:44,520
Don't smile. You're as bad as your Dad.

264
00:22:44,520 --> 00:22:46,520
Give me headaches.

265
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:50,440
Let's eat.

266
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,920
Here.

267
00:23:04,120 --> 00:23:05,440
Thank you

268
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,840
for protecting Ming.

269
00:23:15,160 --> 00:23:17,320
It's me who needs to apologize.

270
00:23:17,320 --> 00:23:19,320
I'm the reason who makes him like this.

271
00:23:21,200 --> 00:23:25,760
Actually, I was the one who sent the lawyer to your house.

272
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:30,160
I knew it.

273
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:43,080
Ma'am, I know that you're worried about Ming.

274
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,840
But before this, my Mom was very sick.

275
00:23:49,480 --> 00:23:53,120
And she had a huge debt.

276
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:55,120
Ming just wanted to help.

277
00:23:55,880 --> 00:23:57,880
But don't you worry.

278
00:23:58,280 --> 00:24:00,840
When my career is more stable,

279
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:04,280
I'll give you back everything as soon as possible.

280
00:24:07,040 --> 00:24:08,240
Mom.

281
00:24:08,680 --> 00:24:11,880
We are not together for benefits like you think.

282
00:24:13,360 --> 00:24:14,560
I'm serious.

283
00:24:15,800 --> 00:24:18,120
For me...

284
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:22,120
The most important thing is your happiness.

285
00:24:24,440 --> 00:24:28,440
If you've already chosen, I won't intervene.

286
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:35,960
But for your Dad, you gotta sort it yourself.

287
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:46,120
I'm happy that you don't stop me.

288
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:52,240
Are you gonna continue eating?

289
00:24:55,320 --> 00:24:56,920
Would you like to feed him?

290
00:24:56,920 --> 00:24:59,920
It's alright. If I did, he wouldn't eat.

291
00:25:02,520 --> 00:25:04,080
Not that one.

292
00:25:17,720 --> 00:25:21,920
Do you know how many laws I broke in order to get this?

293
00:25:25,400 --> 00:25:27,400
I've taken it as I keep my word.

294
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,480
The rest is on your own.

295
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:36,160
Thank you.

296
00:25:37,480 --> 00:25:40,920
That side is preparing for this too. Be cautious.

297
00:25:47,080 --> 00:25:48,440
I'll take it to the car for you.

298
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,240
Oh, thanks.

299
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:58,720
Ming, what is going on now?

300
00:26:01,880 --> 00:26:05,040
If you wanna know, you gotta come with me.

301
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,760
I have an appoinment with my Dad.

302
00:26:24,560 --> 00:26:26,160
Are you good now?

303
00:26:28,160 --> 00:26:29,720
I think you should worry about yourself.

304
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:39,200
This is all the evidence.

305
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:43,200
Tong used your company's name to get the money in order to clear his own debts.

306
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:48,080
Er...Ming, where did you get that?

307
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:49,320
That's not true, Dad.

308
00:26:49,320 --> 00:26:53,320
A business man like you should know that.

309
00:26:54,200 --> 00:26:54,840
I'd like to explain...

310
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,600
That's enough, stop talking.

311
00:26:56,600 --> 00:26:59,040
If this gets to the press,

312
00:26:59,040 --> 00:27:02,640
you know how the family's stock will turn out.

313
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:05,600
And when Mom goes to the opening events...

314
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:08,560
You might have to hear people gossip

315
00:27:08,920 --> 00:27:10,840
your son-in-law is a fraud.

316
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,720
What do you want?

317
00:27:16,200 --> 00:27:18,440
I won't release this to the press,

318
00:27:18,440 --> 00:27:20,360
but you gotta promise me first,

319
00:27:20,880 --> 00:27:23,280
that you will stop messing with me.

320
00:27:23,280 --> 00:27:26,840
You dare exchange our family's reputation with him?

321
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:31,240
Ming.

322
00:27:32,160 --> 00:27:33,360
Think about this.

323
00:27:34,280 --> 00:27:37,320
If you do this,

324
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,920
I won't have any place in the entertainment industry.

325
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:42,600
You did this to yourself. Why would I feel sorry for you?

326
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:45,280
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

327
00:27:45,280 --> 00:27:47,560
But you should at least feel sorry for you nephew.

328
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:58,840
Well...May is 4-month pregnant now.

329
00:28:01,040 --> 00:28:04,360
I was about to tell this to everyone

330
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:07,920
at Mom's birthday party next month.

331
00:28:07,920 --> 00:28:11,560
Ming, let's talk nicely.

332
00:28:11,920 --> 00:28:13,920
At least, for your nephew.

333
00:28:21,280 --> 00:28:23,080
This doesn't have anything to do with my child.

334
00:28:24,400 --> 00:28:28,000
May, we're talking business here.

335
00:28:28,000 --> 00:28:31,560
Then keep talking. Why would you have our child involved?

336
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:35,760
Ming, do whatever you need to do.

337
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:37,240
Don't worry about me and the child.

338
00:28:37,880 --> 00:28:39,080
Sis.

339
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:42,560
May...

340
00:28:42,560 --> 00:28:44,000
How could you say that?

341
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,200
This is my family.

342
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:52,080
But you, you're then one taking advantage of my family.

343
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:00,720
So, what is it, Dad?

344
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:03,560
Between the youngest son who gives you a headache...

345
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:05,440
and protecting your company

346
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,720
which you've been building your entire life.

347
00:29:07,720 --> 00:29:09,600
I think it's not so difficult to choose.

348
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:13,960
Alright.

349
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,840
I'll allow you two to be together.

350
00:29:22,640 --> 00:29:24,840
But you must leave this house empty-handed.

351
00:29:25,240 --> 00:29:26,720
And never come back and see me again.

352
00:29:26,720 --> 00:29:28,480
My dear...

353
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,880
My business, I got the money to manage it on my own.

354
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:35,080
And what right do you have to take my business from me?

355
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,280
The connections that you have, also the knowledge,

356
00:29:38,800 --> 00:29:41,000
you got them all from me.

357
00:29:41,000 --> 00:29:48,360
So what it's gonna be? Your life savings and that man...

358
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:50,440
I think...

359
00:29:51,160 --> 00:29:53,120
it's not so difficult to choose.

360
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,840
That's true, Dad.

361
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,200
But I choose Joe.

362
00:30:14,120 --> 00:30:18,520
Ming! Ming! Dear...

363
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:31,840
So how was it, Mr. Ming?

364
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,080
I got kicked out of the house.

365
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:41,080
From now on, you won't have to take care of me anymore.

366
00:30:42,200 --> 00:30:46,040
No, wherever you go, I will follow.

367
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:50,640
Thanks.

368
00:30:50,920 --> 00:30:53,320
But I won't have the money to hire you anymore.

369
00:30:54,200 --> 00:30:56,080
But I know who does.

370
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,640
Mike is looking for a secretary.

371
00:31:01,640 --> 00:31:04,040
But he hasn't found the right one yet.

372
00:31:04,040 --> 00:31:07,320
Do you think working for my brother...

373
00:31:07,320 --> 00:31:09,000
will be good for you?

374
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:12,160
Er...

375
00:31:13,280 --> 00:31:16,000
I've already made an interview appointment for you.

376
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,520
Hurry up and go!

377
00:31:27,600 --> 00:31:30,200
Thank you for everything, Mr. Ming.

378
00:31:49,400 --> 00:31:50,600
Ming.

379
00:31:56,280 --> 00:31:59,080
Are you sure that you're gonna leave this house?

380
00:32:03,160 --> 00:32:06,560
Because if you're leaving,

381
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:08,560
you'll have to start from zero with me.

382
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:15,360
And are you sure about that?

383
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:17,920
Once we step out of this house,

384
00:32:17,920 --> 00:32:20,520
we're starting a war with my family.

385
00:32:21,400 --> 00:32:23,400
I don't know what we're facing next.

386
00:32:27,760 --> 00:32:30,960
Then why not? I'm ready for it.

387
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:45,320
Let's go.

388
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:36,560
What?

389
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:46,960
What is it? How long are you going to look at me?

390
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:51,360
I just wanna see your face clearly.

391
00:33:54,200 --> 00:33:56,200
So that I'll know that I'm not dreaming.

392
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:08,920
Ming, you know...after we did it,

393
00:34:11,880 --> 00:34:15,760
I looked at you and thought the same way too.

394
00:34:24,320 --> 00:34:25,320
Joe.

395
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:26,440
Huh?

396
00:34:31,239 --> 00:34:33,239
Finally, we are really together.

397
00:34:56,199 --> 00:34:59,200
But there's still one more thing I need to sort.

398
00:35:05,800 --> 00:35:07,800
About your Mom, right?

399
00:35:11,640 --> 00:35:15,440
Let's go see her this afternoon.

400
00:35:17,160 --> 00:35:21,760
So I can go apologize and...explain everything to her.

401
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:25,720
Alright.

402
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,600
You had your secretary send me a divorce paper?

403
00:35:51,600 --> 00:35:52,800
Huh?

404
00:36:03,000 --> 00:36:05,000
Need I say more?

405
00:36:06,920 --> 00:36:09,240
You chose your brother over me.

406
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:12,440
I didn't see that Ming was more important than you.

407
00:36:16,120 --> 00:36:18,840
I just thought that our child...

408
00:36:18,840 --> 00:36:22,720
was more important than being a leverage.

409
00:36:23,960 --> 00:36:25,840
Pack your bags and leave my house.

410
00:36:26,280 --> 00:36:29,680
Tong, why are you saying this?

411
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,360
I've always wondered one thing.

412
00:36:36,840 --> 00:36:40,160
If I didn't have money,

413
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,960
would you still wanna marry me?

414
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:54,840
You already know the answer.

415
00:37:10,200 --> 00:37:13,400
I'm...I'm sorry.

416
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:49,560
Hey, Joe. You wanna go grab a bite after this?

417
00:37:49,560 --> 00:37:50,720
Today?

418
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:51,920
Yeah.

419
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:55,560
Sorry, my boyfriend is picking me up.

420
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,040
Oh, someone's picking him up.

421
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,840
Let's go, guys. We're jealous of the love in the air.

422
00:38:01,840 --> 00:38:03,080
Let's go, let's go.

423
00:38:03,080 --> 00:38:04,360
Sorry, see ya later.

424
00:38:04,360 --> 00:38:05,960
Alright, see ya.

425
00:38:06,640 --> 00:38:07,520
So who's treating tonight?

426
00:38:07,520 --> 00:38:08,840
I got you, bros.

427
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:29,720
Just one sec, Ming, let me check my stuff first.

428
00:38:32,160 --> 00:38:33,360
Joe.

429
00:38:38,400 --> 00:38:39,600
Tong.

430
00:38:41,240 --> 00:38:42,840
Joe, help me.

431
00:38:43,600 --> 00:38:45,840
Please talk to Ming for me.

432
00:38:45,840 --> 00:38:48,040
Let him help me.

433
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:49,920
Or else the loan shark will kill me.

434
00:38:49,920 --> 00:38:53,280
Tong, you know, Ming's got no money now.

435
00:38:53,280 --> 00:38:56,600
Just apologize to his Dad. He'll go soft.

436
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,920
Please help me, Joe.

437
00:38:57,920 --> 00:38:59,400
Joe, you're the only person Ming listens to.

438
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:00,480
Tong.

439
00:39:00,480 --> 00:39:02,280
Right now, I don't believe you anymore.

440
00:39:02,280 --> 00:39:04,920
Even though you're telling the truth, I'm not helping.

441
00:39:06,360 --> 00:39:09,360
Joe, please help me.

442
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:10,640
Let go, Tong.

443
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,280
I still wanna see my baby's face.

444
00:39:12,280 --> 00:39:14,640
I don't want him to be an orphan.

445
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:15,920
Please, for my baby.

446
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:18,960
Oh, there...there...

447
00:39:20,720 --> 00:39:24,360
So this is a No.1 superstar? Look at him now.

448
00:39:25,120 --> 00:39:28,520
Joe, please help me. They're here.

449
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:33,520
Hey, give him to us. And we'll go our separate ways.

450
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:35,720
Joe, I'm begging you.

451
00:39:56,720 --> 00:39:57,920
Go, go!

452
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:26,480
Joe!

453
00:40:51,680 --> 00:40:53,040
Joe.

454
00:40:53,040 --> 00:40:56,560
Tong, calm down. Calm down!

455
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:59,640
I'll take care of this.

456
00:41:00,120 --> 00:41:01,320
Joe.

457
00:41:03,800 --> 00:41:08,000
He knew that they'd definitely take me.

458
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:10,960
So he switched himself wth me.

459
00:41:13,040 --> 00:41:17,120
Liar! Why would Joe help you?

460
00:41:18,080 --> 00:41:20,080
He didn't think about helping me. He wanted to help my baby.

461
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,560
He didn't think about helping me. He wanted to help my baby.

462
00:41:23,320 --> 00:41:25,320
So that I could see my baby's face.

463
00:41:26,720 --> 00:41:29,920
Joe! How long are you gonna be the good guy?

464
00:41:30,320 --> 00:41:34,320
I'm so sorry. Everything happened so fast.

465
00:41:35,400 --> 00:41:36,920
If I knew that something would happen,

466
00:41:36,920 --> 00:41:38,400
I wouldn't let Joe go.

467
00:41:38,400 --> 00:41:40,000
Why are you saying sorry now?

468
00:41:40,000 --> 00:41:42,680
Huh? It's too late, see?

469
00:41:42,680 --> 00:41:45,080
Hey, stop fighting.

470
00:41:45,800 --> 00:41:48,000
Let's come up with a way to help Joe first, okay?

471
00:41:54,120 --> 00:41:57,320
I just knew that a stand-in took a job off work also.

472
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:00,760
You're Tong's collector?

473
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:04,760
Yes, but today you're gonna die for him instead.

474
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:08,320
Kill him.

475
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:19,840
Let me go!

476
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:29,960
Call him.

477
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:05,400
Hello.

478
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:10,800
Hello. I'm Ming, Tong's brother-in-law.

479
00:43:11,680 --> 00:43:13,680
Oh, the real wallet is here.

480
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:17,400
Hey, wait.

481
00:43:27,120 --> 00:43:29,960
I know that you got the wrong guy.

482
00:43:29,960 --> 00:43:31,960
I promise you that I'm gonna give you back every Baht.

483
00:43:35,240 --> 00:43:39,000
But you must promise me that you won't hurt him too.

484
00:43:39,360 --> 00:43:43,600
Before, you never thought about helping your brother-in-law.

485
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,080
But now you're helping him because of this stand-in?

486
00:43:56,160 --> 00:43:58,240
How much does Tong owe you?

487
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:00,640
So this stand-in isn't just an ordinary guy.

488
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:04,560
Tong owes me three hundreds of million Baht-ish.

489
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:07,280
Plus the interest and for wasting my time...

490
00:44:07,280 --> 00:44:10,440
I'll just say he owes me five hundreds of million Baht.

491
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:15,000
Hey, that's taking advantage of us! Cheater!

492
00:44:15,000 --> 00:44:18,200
I want this in cash before Midnight today.

493
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:21,560
And if you call the police,

494
00:44:21,560 --> 00:44:23,680
you will never see him again.

495
00:44:23,680 --> 00:44:27,000
That amount of money, we can't find it in time for you.

496
00:44:27,000 --> 00:44:29,480
Then call your Dad.

497
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:33,280
Just a snap of fingers, he'll find the money.

498
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:55,240
Dad, I'm not here to borrow your money.

499
00:44:56,240 --> 00:44:58,240
But I'm asking you to return the money to my bank account.

500
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:03,080
My dear...

501
00:45:06,840 --> 00:45:09,960
Okay, you win.

502
00:45:12,280 --> 00:45:14,280
I'll do everything.

503
00:45:15,200 --> 00:45:17,200
Just help Joe.

504
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:22,360
Mike, take them out.

505
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:24,320
I'd like to take a rest.

506
00:45:28,360 --> 00:45:30,160
This is all my fault.

507
00:45:33,920 --> 00:45:35,920
Joe has nothing to do with this.

508
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,720
But he still sacrificed himself...

509
00:45:39,720 --> 00:45:42,080
in order to save your grandchild.

510
00:45:44,360 --> 00:45:46,960
So now, you're acting like a Dad?

511
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:49,320
You just used him as a leverage before.

512
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:53,840
Even though you destroyed Ming's evidence.

513
00:45:53,840 --> 00:45:56,840
I still have a copy of it.

514
00:45:56,840 --> 00:46:01,440
If you're not helping, I'll send this to the press.

515
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:05,680
I'd rather leave the entertainment industry

516
00:46:05,680 --> 00:46:08,880
than having to avoid my child.

517
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,400
The ones whom you cheated,

518
00:46:17,400 --> 00:46:19,400
I already sent people to clear off the debts.

519
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,480
But for the loan shark of yours,

520
00:46:24,160 --> 00:46:25,680
you're on your own.

521
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:37,640
Alright.

522
00:46:38,960 --> 00:46:42,560
If you're not helping...

523
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:44,560
I'll handle it.

524
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:50,880
Excuse me, Dad.

525
00:47:14,400 --> 00:47:15,880
It's almost midnight, Boss.

526
00:47:15,880 --> 00:47:19,080
Alright, we gotta send them something as a warning.

527
00:47:19,080 --> 00:47:20,120
Go.

528
00:47:36,640 --> 00:47:38,320
I'm in front of the house.

529
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:42,040
Alright, I'll send some people to welcome you.

530
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:44,680
Alright.

531
00:47:45,800 --> 00:47:47,000
Hey, search them.

532
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,080
All cleared. Boss

533
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,440
Send them up.

534
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:08,640
Let them in.

535
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:13,440
Wait.

536
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:16,840
Boss only allows one person to go up.

537
00:48:21,200 --> 00:48:22,400
I'll go.

538
00:48:22,600 --> 00:48:23,800
No.

539
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:27,040
This must be me, only.

540
00:48:28,920 --> 00:48:30,120
This way.

541
00:48:44,600 --> 00:48:45,800
Joe.

542
00:48:47,080 --> 00:48:48,080
Ming.

543
00:48:48,080 --> 00:48:51,600
Oh, mister, you're here by yourself...

544
00:48:51,600 --> 00:48:53,920
I get it now. This stand-in is not just an ordinary guy.

545
00:48:55,080 --> 00:48:56,280
Let him go first.

546
00:48:57,240 --> 00:48:58,440
Let him go.

547
00:49:03,160 --> 00:49:04,760
Ming! / Joe, Joe!

548
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:07,240
Now your turn.

549
00:49:22,480 --> 00:49:23,680
What's this?

550
00:49:26,600 --> 00:49:30,600
Ten million Baht in exchange of me and him.

551
00:49:30,600 --> 00:49:33,000
Ming, you can't do this, Ming!

552
00:49:33,000 --> 00:49:35,000
That's enough. That's enough!

553
00:49:36,160 --> 00:49:38,480
If you want the rest of the money,

554
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:39,560
you will need me.

555
00:49:40,560 --> 00:49:42,560
My Mom can give you more than five hundred million Baht.

556
00:49:46,920 --> 00:49:49,720
Why are you doing all this for just this guy?

557
00:49:58,520 --> 00:50:01,320
Because he's an important one to me.

558
00:50:01,320 --> 00:50:03,320
No one can ever replace him.

559
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:08,440
Alright, okay. Deal.

560
00:50:24,560 --> 00:50:26,000
You called the police?

561
00:50:26,920 --> 00:50:29,160
Who called the police? / Must be my Mom.

562
00:50:30,280 --> 00:50:31,640
They called the police!

563
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:32,960
What the fuck!?

564
00:50:32,960 --> 00:50:34,280
What are you playing?!

565
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,200
I'm not, I'm not!

566
00:50:38,760 --> 00:50:39,760
You called the police?!

567
00:50:39,760 --> 00:50:40,760
Drop your weapons, this is the police!

568
00:50:40,760 --> 00:50:45,440
Drop your weapons, drop them now!

569
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,160
Drop them!

570
00:50:49,080 --> 00:50:50,360
On your knees! Down!

571
00:50:52,280 --> 00:50:53,720
What are you trying to do?!

572
00:50:53,720 --> 00:50:55,200
I'm not, I don't know anything.

573
00:51:01,280 --> 00:51:02,760
Ming, run, now!

574
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:04,360
Run!

575
00:51:16,960 --> 00:51:18,160
Joe!

576
00:51:24,800 --> 00:51:26,000
Ming!

577
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:28,120
Ming!

578
00:51:29,440 --> 00:51:30,640
Ming!

579
00:51:50,120 --> 00:51:52,320
Joe!, Joe!

580
00:51:52,320 --> 00:51:53,720
Joe.

581
00:51:54,640 --> 00:51:55,640
Joe.

582
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,880
Joe, Joe, Joe.

583
00:51:58,880 --> 00:51:59,880
Joe.

584
00:52:00,160 --> 00:52:01,160
Joe.

585
00:52:01,560 --> 00:52:02,560
Joe.

586
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:04,080
Joe.

587
00:52:04,480 --> 00:52:05,480
Joe.

588
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:07,120
Joe.

589
00:52:07,800 --> 00:52:08,800
Joe.

590
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:12,120
Joe.

591
00:52:15,000 --> 00:52:16,000
Joe.

592
00:52:17,840 --> 00:52:19,560
Ming... / Joe.

593
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:25,880
Stop right there! Drop your weapon!

594
00:52:25,880 --> 00:52:27,280
Drop it!

595
00:52:30,040 --> 00:52:31,240
Joe.

596
00:52:37,200 --> 00:52:38,400
Joe.

597
00:52:42,440 --> 00:52:43,440
Joe!

598
00:52:43,600 --> 00:52:44,600
Joe!

599
00:52:45,080 --> 00:52:46,280
Joe.

600
00:52:47,960 --> 00:52:49,160
Joe.

601
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:51,040
Joe.

602
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:52,400
Joe.

603
00:52:53,200 --> 00:52:54,400
Joe.

604
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:33,160
Finally, we meet.

605
00:54:36,680 --> 00:54:38,680
Who are you?

606
00:54:39,240 --> 00:54:41,560
I'm Ming's master.

607
00:54:41,560 --> 00:54:44,360
What you're seeing now is my mind.

608
00:54:58,400 --> 00:55:02,400
So that means I'm dead?

609
00:55:03,240 --> 00:55:07,320
Not dead...nor alive.

610
00:55:07,320 --> 00:55:11,280
You're between life and death once again.

611
00:55:11,280 --> 00:55:12,480
Once again?

612
00:55:13,040 --> 00:55:16,720
Last time, the heaven decided your fate.

613
00:55:16,720 --> 00:55:20,120
So that's why you're facing all of this again.

614
00:55:20,120 --> 00:55:24,120
But today, you can choose it yourself.

615
00:55:24,520 --> 00:55:27,440
If you want to torture yourself and remain in this loop,

616
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:29,160
just return to the body.

617
00:55:29,160 --> 00:55:32,080
But if you wanna get out of this cycle,

618
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:35,480
you can walk out that door.

619
00:56:05,080 --> 00:56:07,080
Aren't you tired?

620
00:56:10,240 --> 00:56:14,800
A life that you need to be a stand-in for someone...

621
00:56:22,120 --> 00:56:23,320
Tong.

622
00:56:26,200 --> 00:56:27,400
Who are you?

623
00:56:31,320 --> 00:56:33,320
Why didn't you choose me, Tong?

624
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:38,080
If I don't go to there, everyone will be in trouble.

625
00:56:38,080 --> 00:56:40,280
As long as I'm here,

626
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,240
you're not going anywhere.

627
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,480
I bought you, so you can wig a tail for me,

628
00:56:45,480 --> 00:56:47,480
not to bite me like this.
