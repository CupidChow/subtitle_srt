1
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:52,840
Hello.

2
00:01:52,840 --> 00:01:54,840
Hello, Joe, how are you doing?

3
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:20,000
My name is Joe. I'm a stand-in.

4
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:23,360
My work is to be the person...

5
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,550
who does things that others...

6
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:27,320
won't do.

7
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:39,920
Ming is calling...

8
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:43,630
Hello.

9
00:02:43,630 --> 00:02:44,510
Joe!

10
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:45,670
Joe where are you.

11
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Hello.

12
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,800
Hello, Ming.

13
00:02:50,110 --> 00:02:51,110
Hello.

14
00:03:00,320 --> 00:03:02,920
Hey, Joe. The set is ready. Let's go.

15
00:03:03,670 --> 00:03:04,670
Alright.

16
00:04:01,960 --> 00:04:03,280
Safety, is the set ready?

17
00:04:03,670 --> 00:04:04,670
Yes.

18
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:07,480
Alright, we're ready. Silence, please, everyone.

19
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:08,760
Alright, let's do it.

20
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:10,840
Camera, rolling.

21
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:16,110
And this job is about to change my life...

22
00:04:16,110 --> 00:04:17,800
forever...

23
00:04:17,959 --> 00:04:19,190
Three.

24
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:24,400
Two.

25
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:30,230
One.

26
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:35,320
Action!

27
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:53,550
Drift!

28
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:05,960
Shit! / Check the stunt! Check the stunt!

29
00:05:05,960 --> 00:05:06,800
Hey, hurry up!

30
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:09,360
Need help here! The sling is torn!

31
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:13,070
This is my life.

32
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,070
Every time I'm about to step out of the darkness,

33
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:22,000
something drags me down.

34
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,630
But this may be the last time...

35
00:05:28,630 --> 00:05:31,030
that I try.

36
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:51,440
Joe.

37
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,150
Joe, are you awake, son?

38
00:05:54,920 --> 00:05:57,920
Miss, please get us a doctor.

39
00:05:58,880 --> 00:05:59,880
Joe.

40
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,840
Joe, please don't leave me again.

41
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,110
Who are you, auntie?

42
00:06:10,840 --> 00:06:11,840
Joe.

43
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:15,760
Can you not remember me? It's me, your Mom.

44
00:06:16,510 --> 00:06:17,800
It's Mommy.

45
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:21,150
My Mom passed away a long time ago.

46
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:23,800
I think you must've misunderstood something.

47
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:25,150
Stay calm.

48
00:06:25,150 --> 00:06:27,630
The patient has been unconscious for two years.

49
00:06:27,630 --> 00:06:29,670
At first, he may be a little confused.

50
00:06:29,670 --> 00:06:32,000
So for now, let's give him to recover.

51
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,670
I'm not confused.

52
00:06:33,670 --> 00:06:35,800
I think you all must've misunderstood something.

53
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:38,230
The hospital will do the physical check-up again.

54
00:06:38,230 --> 00:06:39,800
But let him rest a lot.

55
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:43,110
And, Miss, please come with me to fill out the patient's information for me.

56
00:06:43,110 --> 00:06:45,320
Oh, alright.

57
00:06:45,320 --> 00:06:47,630
Joe, I'll be right back.

58
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:54,280
This way, please.

59
00:07:46,110 --> 00:07:48,440
They didn't misunderstand.

60
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:52,280
I did...

61
00:07:52,280 --> 00:07:54,280
Whose body am I in?

62
00:08:31,430 --> 00:08:33,309
The results look better.

63
00:08:33,309 --> 00:08:34,559
And about the memory,

64
00:08:34,559 --> 00:08:36,760
the doctor said that he's gonna get better.

65
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:38,919
Just having my child back, it means the world to me.

66
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:40,350
I'm happy to hear that.

67
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,110
Thank you.

68
00:08:41,110 --> 00:08:42,190
Of course.

69
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:43,429
We're going home.

70
00:08:46,920 --> 00:08:49,390
So the prescription...

71
00:08:50,310 --> 00:08:51,470
I'm sorry

72
00:08:51,470 --> 00:08:53,720
but her son is gone...

73
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:56,920
I guess his name is Joe too.

74
00:08:58,390 --> 00:09:00,390
So he was taken away by mistake.

75
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:05,470
Wait...

76
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:11,760
Or her son could be stuck in my body?

77
00:09:16,030 --> 00:09:17,030
Thank you.

78
00:09:22,310 --> 00:09:26,190
Hey, he's really awake, Mrs. Ing!

79
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:27,960
At first, when the nurse told me,

80
00:09:27,960 --> 00:09:30,520
I thought she was kidding.

81
00:09:30,680 --> 00:09:32,680
He's awake now.

82
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:36,430
You're weak!

83
00:09:36,430 --> 00:09:37,470
Don't put down the glass!

84
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,030
Don't put down the bottle! Don't leave the bottle there!

85
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:44,390
This is Wut. His Dad is being treated in that bed.

86
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:49,560
Your name is Joe, right?

87
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:51,270
That's such a coincidence.

88
00:09:51,270 --> 00:09:54,150
I used to have a close junior named Joe too.

89
00:09:54,150 --> 00:09:57,680
But he was a little older than you.

90
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:01,680
Don't worry. You're much more handsome than him.

91
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,230
And how is he doing now?

92
00:10:06,230 --> 00:10:09,150
Well, there's an accident.

93
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:13,030
Joe fell of the cliff and disappeared two years ago.

94
00:10:13,030 --> 00:10:15,390
They haven't found his body since.

95
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:17,390
You're luckier than him.

96
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:19,390
You came back.

97
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,350
Mrs. Ing, so how long will he have to stay here?

98
00:10:23,350 --> 00:10:27,110
The doctor said he would check again first.

99
00:10:32,030 --> 00:10:36,030
ONE MONTH LATER

100
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:40,680
Oh, Mrs. Ing.

101
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,150
Are you guys going home now?

102
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:42,840
Yes.

103
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:43,680
Would you like a ride?

104
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:45,800
Oh, that's alright.

105
00:10:45,800 --> 00:10:48,520
There's no need to say no.

106
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:50,470
I should be the one who does this.

107
00:10:50,470 --> 00:10:53,520
You've been taking care of my Dad for so long.

108
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:56,000
Let me give you a ride. My car is parked at the back.

109
00:10:57,840 --> 00:11:00,030
Don't overthink.

110
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,960
What is it, son?

111
00:11:07,960 --> 00:11:09,920
Can you remember him?

112
00:11:15,190 --> 00:11:17,430
I don't think so, Mrs. Ing.

113
00:11:17,430 --> 00:11:19,640
Although Joe's been in modeling for years,

114
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:23,310
this guy's been in the industry for about half a year.

115
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:23,920
Oh.

116
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,000
It's good you didn't get to meet him.

117
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,000
Oh, right. Wut, you're working in this industry, aren't you?

118
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,470
Wut, do you know him?

119
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:35,880
Yes, I do. I do know him better than anyone.

120
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:40,600
Let's go.

121
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:41,640
Alright.

122
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:44,640
C'mon, Mrs. Ing, hold on to me. Take it easy.

123
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:48,230
Thanks. Let this old lady hang on to you.

124
00:12:03,390 --> 00:12:04,390
Welcome.

125
00:12:04,390 --> 00:12:05,150
Thank you.

126
00:12:08,070 --> 00:12:09,070
So here we are.

127
00:12:11,430 --> 00:12:12,430
C'mon, son.

128
00:12:16,030 --> 00:12:17,030
Excuse me.

129
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:19,470
Oh, Mrs. Ing, be careful.

130
00:12:19,470 --> 00:12:20,470
I will.

131
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:26,960
Welcome.

132
00:12:26,960 --> 00:12:27,960
Thank you.

133
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,070
I'll put your stuff right here, alright?

134
00:12:36,350 --> 00:12:37,350
Thanks.

135
00:12:37,350 --> 00:12:39,470
So, why don't you stay here for dinner?

136
00:12:39,470 --> 00:12:41,070
I'll warm up the stew for you in just a sec.

137
00:12:41,070 --> 00:12:42,920
Thank you very much, Mrs. Ing.

138
00:12:42,920 --> 00:12:44,920
But I have a meeting.

139
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:46,640
Maybe another time, Mrs. Ing.

140
00:12:46,640 --> 00:12:47,520
Oh, what a pity.

141
00:12:47,520 --> 00:12:50,230
It's alright then. Maybe another time, then.

142
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:53,150
I'll go warm up the stew first.

143
00:12:53,150 --> 00:12:54,150
Yes, Mom.

144
00:12:57,720 --> 00:12:58,720
Joe.

145
00:12:58,720 --> 00:12:59,720
Yes?

146
00:13:02,230 --> 00:13:05,720
About the work, my company produces movies.

147
00:13:05,720 --> 00:13:08,560
If you're well and want to do something,

148
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:09,470
call me.

149
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,600
Thank you very much, Wut.

150
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,310
I don't know why...

151
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,640
but you remind me of Joe.

152
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:27,270
Nevermind, nevermind. Gotta go.

153
00:13:27,270 --> 00:13:28,190
See you around.

154
00:13:28,190 --> 00:13:29,190
Alright.

155
00:14:16,030 --> 00:14:18,390
A guy fell off the cliff and disappeared.

156
00:14:18,390 --> 00:14:20,310
Why hasn't anyone said anything about it?

157
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,720
Here is hot rice porridge for you, son.

158
00:14:39,520 --> 00:14:40,520
Thank you.

159
00:14:41,030 --> 00:14:43,800
Why don't you go take a rest, Mom?

160
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:47,070
It's alright, dear. You just recovered and came home.

161
00:14:47,070 --> 00:14:49,150
You must take a lot of rest.

162
00:14:51,720 --> 00:14:55,310
I made you hot rice porridge. Let me feed you.

163
00:14:55,310 --> 00:14:56,350
Er...

164
00:15:00,840 --> 00:15:04,840
Here, easy. It may be really hot.

165
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:07,880
Is it good?

166
00:15:14,030 --> 00:15:15,030
Here, son.

167
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:19,030
I think I should eat it myself.

168
00:15:28,920 --> 00:15:33,430
Joe, I don't want you to hurry and find yourself a job.

169
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:35,470
I want you to really recover first.

170
00:15:41,470 --> 00:15:42,470
Mom.

171
00:15:42,470 --> 00:15:43,470
Huh?

172
00:15:45,190 --> 00:15:48,390
In the past two years, you've spent a lot on me, right?

173
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:55,680
Well, in the past, we used to live in a better place.

174
00:15:56,310 --> 00:16:00,070
But when I retired, I had some savings.

175
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,560
In exchange of me having you back,

176
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:06,150
it's totally worth it.

177
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:08,150
I need nothing more in my life.

178
00:16:17,000 --> 00:16:18,270
Thank you, Mom.

179
00:16:19,840 --> 00:16:21,840
For bringing me back.

180
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:26,920
From now on, let me take care of you, Mom.

181
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:30,960
Oh, dear. Come here.

182
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,110
My beloved son.

183
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,350
Alright.

184
00:16:46,350 --> 00:16:48,350
I will be his stand-in.

185
00:17:02,520 --> 00:17:04,680
My company is just a small company.

186
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,800
But we got everything we need.

187
00:17:06,800 --> 00:17:10,000
We got a studio, a production team,
a post-production team. We got it all.

188
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:13,109
And the best thing is we got our own stunt team.

189
00:17:13,109 --> 00:17:16,640
Because, here, we mainly make action movies.

190
00:17:16,640 --> 00:17:18,640
I may not look convincing,

191
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:22,920
but, I used to be a stuntman.

192
00:17:24,599 --> 00:17:25,599
Alright, let's go.

193
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:27,030
Hello.

194
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:31,880
Wut, Hello.

195
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,310
Hello.

196
00:17:33,310 --> 00:17:34,680
Such a hard-working team.

197
00:17:34,680 --> 00:17:36,070
You look beautiful today, Chom.

198
00:17:39,430 --> 00:17:40,430
C'mon, Joe.

199
00:17:44,470 --> 00:17:45,470
Sit down.

200
00:18:00,680 --> 00:18:04,680
Oh, you remember the guy named Joe that I used to tell you?

201
00:18:04,680 --> 00:18:06,390
He used to be a stuntman here.

202
00:18:06,390 --> 00:18:10,390
And he's the best one that we got.

203
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:12,800
He's a stand-in for Tong-Tinkun.

204
00:18:15,390 --> 00:18:18,520
Do you know him?

205
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:20,640
Oh, yes, I do.

206
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:24,600
Tong, the action superstar.

207
00:18:28,070 --> 00:18:29,430
Er, Wut...

208
00:18:29,430 --> 00:18:32,470
Wut, do you have any behind-the-scene job for me to do?

209
00:18:32,470 --> 00:18:36,030
Maybe working in the prop team or the lighting team.

210
00:18:36,030 --> 00:18:37,390
Wait.

211
00:18:37,390 --> 00:18:40,720
Mrs. Ing said you wanted to be an actor.

212
00:18:41,560 --> 00:18:45,800
Right now, I think the behind-the-scene job is more stable.

213
00:18:45,800 --> 00:18:47,880
And if there's a chance, I'd like to do it.

214
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:51,960
Suit yourself.

215
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:55,270
The prop team is short of people. I'll take you there.

216
00:18:55,270 --> 00:18:56,070
Thank you.

217
00:18:56,070 --> 00:18:57,070
It's alright.

218
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,270
Wut, Prach is looking for you.

219
00:19:02,270 --> 00:19:03,000
Prach?

220
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:06,680
Shit! I forgot I had a meeting!

221
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,390
Yim, take him to the prop team.

222
00:19:09,390 --> 00:19:10,880
Tell Jo that he's from me.

223
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:11,880
Alright.

224
00:19:12,470 --> 00:19:13,470
I'll leave him to you.

225
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,680
We're shooting tomorrow and we haven't finished yet.

226
00:19:23,680 --> 00:19:25,880
Will we get any sleep?

227
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:27,190
Check the wire for me too.

228
00:19:27,190 --> 00:19:29,720
Jo, Wut sent this guy to you.

229
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:31,960
That's great. We're short.

230
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:33,840
Hey, bro, what's your name?

231
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,270
My name is Joe.

232
00:19:35,270 --> 00:19:39,840
Whoa, same name again.
Before, there was a stuntman with the same name.

233
00:19:40,270 --> 00:19:43,230
I had to change to Jojo instead.

234
00:19:43,230 --> 00:19:46,920
And what did you do before this?

235
00:19:46,920 --> 00:19:49,310
Well, I was a model before.

236
00:19:49,310 --> 00:19:52,720
Shit, what did Wut just do to me?

237
00:19:52,720 --> 00:19:55,230
My department is Art.

238
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:56,430
Not Arts of Acting.

239
00:19:56,430 --> 00:19:58,190
What should we do with a model?

240
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,560
What did he just send me?

241
00:20:00,560 --> 00:20:01,920
Oh, well...

242
00:20:01,920 --> 00:20:03,720
Let's give it a try.

243
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:05,560
Pistol, two.

244
00:20:09,920 --> 00:20:11,920
Rifle, one.

245
00:20:17,800 --> 00:20:19,390
Pocket knife, two.

246
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:22,270
And rope, one.

247
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,960
Queue 18, all set.

248
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:31,960
Are you sure you've never done this before?

249
00:20:32,350 --> 00:20:35,920
Oh, I used to help my friends do this.

250
00:20:36,310 --> 00:20:37,880
Good.

251
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:39,680
Alright, it's done for today.

252
00:20:39,680 --> 00:20:41,110
Let's eat.

253
00:20:41,110 --> 00:20:42,600
I'm starving.

254
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:49,150
Here, my wife got us food support.

255
00:20:49,150 --> 00:20:50,560
Hey, Jo!

256
00:20:50,560 --> 00:20:54,150
I miss your wife's chicken's feet soup!

257
00:20:54,150 --> 00:20:57,150
You've had this before? You just got here.

258
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,880
Oh, I've never had it.

259
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,880
But I heard people say that your wife's a great cook.

260
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:06,840
Jojo!

261
00:21:07,030 --> 00:21:08,350
Something's come up.

262
00:21:08,350 --> 00:21:10,430
We won't be going home today.

263
00:21:10,430 --> 00:21:11,430
What's up?

264
00:21:11,430 --> 00:21:13,310
Mr. Ming's commercial...

265
00:21:13,310 --> 00:21:15,230
They want to move it up and shoot it today instead.

266
00:21:15,230 --> 00:21:17,270
Wut is furious.

267
00:21:17,270 --> 00:21:18,600
Today?

268
00:21:19,350 --> 00:21:20,800
Really?

269
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,520
Oh, I love Ming.

270
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:25,190
Let me do my make-up first.

271
00:21:25,190 --> 00:21:27,880
Hey, what's wrong?

272
00:21:27,880 --> 00:21:31,070
You look pale. You were alright earlier.

273
00:21:31,070 --> 00:21:33,560
I'm a bit dizzy.

274
00:21:33,560 --> 00:21:36,070
Can I go home first, Jo?

275
00:21:36,070 --> 00:21:38,310
Well, you're still sick, right? You're recovering.

276
00:21:38,310 --> 00:21:40,920
Just go home and take a rest.
We'll manage the work here.

277
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,270
I'm sorry.

278
00:21:42,270 --> 00:21:44,520
I'll make it up to you next time.

279
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:45,840
It's alright. Take a rest.

280
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:47,520
Okay.

281
00:21:47,520 --> 00:21:48,520
I'm sorry.

282
00:23:21,070 --> 00:23:22,070
Wait.

283
00:23:25,000 --> 00:23:28,000
This feeling is so much like what I felt that day...

284
00:23:32,720 --> 00:23:34,350
three years ago...

285
00:23:34,350 --> 00:23:36,230
The first time I met him.

286
00:23:43,560 --> 00:23:44,560
Tong.

287
00:23:49,760 --> 00:23:51,760
Have we met before?

288
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:56,000
I think you mistook me for someone else.

289
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:17,920
THREE YEARS AGO

290
00:24:21,270 --> 00:24:24,960
Joe, stop eating, or else, do your own makeup.

291
00:24:26,310 --> 00:24:28,960
Well, you're so slow, and I'm famished.

292
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:33,000
Your face is not as nice as Tong's.

293
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:34,960
It needs more time, right?

294
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
You're an ass.

295
00:24:41,310 --> 00:24:42,310
Done.

296
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:43,640
Thanks.

297
00:24:47,430 --> 00:24:50,560
If your face is not seen, you look just like Tong.

298
00:24:50,560 --> 00:24:53,840
Especially, looking at the back.

299
00:24:53,840 --> 00:24:57,840
You're exaggerating, Yim. Who could look so much alike?

300
00:24:58,560 --> 00:24:59,560
Tong!

301
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:17,190
Who are you?

302
00:25:17,190 --> 00:25:20,350
I'm Tong's stand-in.

303
00:25:20,350 --> 00:25:22,030
And where is Tong?

304
00:25:22,030 --> 00:25:24,030
I don't think he's here yet.

305
00:25:24,030 --> 00:25:26,030
Do you have anything urgent?

306
00:25:28,030 --> 00:25:29,030
No.

307
00:25:38,600 --> 00:25:39,960
Who was that?

308
00:25:39,960 --> 00:25:41,030
I don't know.

309
00:25:41,030 --> 00:25:43,840
Maybe he's Tong's fan.

310
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,840
Really? Is he?

311
00:25:53,390 --> 00:25:54,960
Alright, everyone, all set.

312
00:25:54,960 --> 00:25:56,310
Neung, turn off the fan, please.

313
00:25:56,310 --> 00:25:57,470
Alright.

314
00:25:57,470 --> 00:25:59,960
Actors, ready? Silence, please.

315
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:01,960
And action!

316
00:26:46,070 --> 00:26:47,430
Cut! We're good.

317
00:26:47,430 --> 00:26:48,430
Wow.

318
00:26:53,560 --> 00:26:54,680
So?

319
00:26:54,680 --> 00:26:57,000
Wait.

320
00:26:57,000 --> 00:27:00,270
Actually, we finished most of the scenes.

321
00:27:00,270 --> 00:27:02,000
Only Tong's scenes that aren't shot yet.

322
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
So Tong...when will he get here?

323
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:10,070
I always told him to come early,
but he's always occupied by something.

324
00:27:10,070 --> 00:27:11,430
Hello, everyone.

325
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,190
Hello, hello, hello.

326
00:27:13,190 --> 00:27:14,640
I'm sorry for being late.

327
00:27:14,640 --> 00:27:18,470
I happened to get some food support.

328
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:22,520
So please have them all. If you're not full,

329
00:27:22,520 --> 00:27:24,310
there are two more food trucks outside.

330
00:27:26,430 --> 00:27:27,190
Hello.

331
00:27:27,190 --> 00:27:28,150
Hello, hello.

332
00:27:28,150 --> 00:27:29,840
Hey, Pao, hello.

333
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:30,390
Hello.

334
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,470
How are you doing?
You look skinnier than before!

335
00:27:32,470 --> 00:27:35,640
Right, I haven't eaten much recently.

336
00:27:35,640 --> 00:27:37,680
Are you stressed? About what?

337
00:27:37,680 --> 00:27:40,270
About...Phil. Just a bit.

338
00:27:40,270 --> 00:27:42,110
He couldn't manage the actors' schedules quite right.

339
00:27:42,110 --> 00:27:43,960
Oh.

340
00:27:43,960 --> 00:27:45,920
Okay, keep up the good work.

341
00:27:45,920 --> 00:27:48,350
Yeah, go get dressed, hurry up.

342
00:27:48,350 --> 00:27:50,470
Hey, Joe, how was it?

343
00:27:52,430 --> 00:27:55,470
How many scenes have they taken?

344
00:27:55,470 --> 00:27:57,030
The first location is all done.

345
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,800
Just the first?

346
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:01,430
So I gotta wait for them to set another setting?

347
00:28:01,430 --> 00:28:04,000
I should've come here thirty minutes later.

348
00:28:05,640 --> 00:28:09,000
Thanks, man. Thanks a lot. Thanks.

349
00:28:09,000 --> 00:28:10,190
Okay, hello all.

350
00:28:10,190 --> 00:28:11,390
Hello, hello.

351
00:28:11,390 --> 00:28:13,030
Yes, hello to you.

352
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:19,760
Hey, Yo, how are you going? You got skinnier?

353
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:21,150
I'm the same.

354
00:28:21,150 --> 00:28:23,190
And my name is still Yim, the same.

355
00:28:23,190 --> 00:28:24,190
Yim?

356
00:28:24,470 --> 00:28:28,310
Sorry, I'm too old. Don't mind me.

357
00:28:28,310 --> 00:28:30,350
Who says you're old?

358
00:28:30,350 --> 00:28:32,800
You're still as handsome as ever.

359
00:28:32,800 --> 00:28:34,030
Ming!

360
00:28:34,030 --> 00:28:36,800
When did you come back?

361
00:28:36,800 --> 00:28:38,760
I just landed here this morning.

362
00:28:38,760 --> 00:28:40,350
I graduated.

363
00:28:40,350 --> 00:28:42,150
So I'm thinking about finding something to do here.

364
00:28:42,150 --> 00:28:45,720
I thought you were gonna stay there for good.

365
00:28:45,720 --> 00:28:49,960
If that place had been so good,
you would've come to visit me, right?

366
00:28:51,390 --> 00:28:55,720
Oh, Ming, you know how busy I've been these days.

367
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:59,310
But I let May bring what I had for you.

368
00:28:59,310 --> 00:29:01,720
That doesn't count.

369
00:29:01,720 --> 00:29:05,880
How about this? Tonight,
you gotta buy me dinner to make things up.

370
00:29:09,110 --> 00:29:13,230
Ming, I gotta shoot this movie all day.

371
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:15,880
I think it will take me the whole night.

372
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,760
Maybe next time.

373
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:24,000
Tong, I came here just to see you.

374
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:26,390
Er...

375
00:29:26,390 --> 00:29:28,920
Tong, may I add some lipstick?

376
00:29:28,920 --> 00:29:30,070
Oh, right, right, right.

377
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:31,760
I'll have to finish my makeup.

378
00:29:31,760 --> 00:29:32,760
Let's talk later.

379
00:29:35,920 --> 00:29:36,920
Alright.

380
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:09,270
Where are you going? I'll give you a ride.

381
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,560
It's alright.

382
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:16,760
Just hop in.

383
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:20,270
It's about to rain,
and it's hard to find a ride during this time.

384
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:27,310
I'm gonna go see my sister.

385
00:30:27,310 --> 00:30:29,680
You can drop me off at the sky train station.

386
00:30:31,390 --> 00:30:32,390
Get in.

387
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:16,920
I'm so sore today.

388
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,760
Bad traffic during this time of day, right?

389
00:31:23,920 --> 00:31:24,920
Yes.

390
00:31:29,560 --> 00:31:31,560
Er...my name is Joe.

391
00:31:45,560 --> 00:31:48,520
And...are you Tong's fan?

392
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:52,680
Yeah.

393
00:31:59,800 --> 00:32:02,760
At first, I thought you were also a celebrity.

394
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,110
You are handsome.

395
00:32:06,110 --> 00:32:08,920
Or are you a celebrity? Are you?

396
00:32:09,310 --> 00:32:10,310
No.

397
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:12,920
No?

398
00:32:16,760 --> 00:32:18,760
You wanna listen to music?

399
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,840
Hello? Where are you?

400
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,190
In a taxi?

401
00:32:25,190 --> 00:32:28,680
Yes, thinking about going to see my sis.

402
00:32:28,680 --> 00:32:29,960
Why don't you come see me?

403
00:32:29,960 --> 00:32:32,840
I've prepared a homecoming party
for a student from abroad!

404
00:32:32,840 --> 00:32:36,560
Oh, you didn't finish late today?

405
00:32:36,560 --> 00:32:38,030
You fooled me?

406
00:32:38,030 --> 00:32:40,600
Well, you had a surprise for me.

407
00:32:40,600 --> 00:32:42,560
Why could I not surprise you?

408
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:46,070
Luckily, May has checked with your host family.

409
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,270
So we've prepared a party for you
since this morning.

410
00:32:49,270 --> 00:32:50,640
Here!

411
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,000
Surprise!

412
00:32:53,000 --> 00:32:54,560
Get here fast!

413
00:32:54,560 --> 00:32:56,840
Here, I've prepared some marinated pork
that you like for you.

414
00:33:05,190 --> 00:33:06,190
I changed my mind.

415
00:33:06,560 --> 00:33:07,560
Huh?

416
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,470
You can take me anywhere.

417
00:33:09,800 --> 00:33:10,800
What?

418
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:12,920
Where do you wanna go then?

419
00:33:12,920 --> 00:33:14,760
I said anywhere.

420
00:33:18,470 --> 00:33:22,960
Then, after we pass this intersection,
there's a restaurant on the right.

421
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:30,560
If you can't think of anywhere...

422
00:33:30,560 --> 00:33:32,520
we can go to your place.

423
00:33:41,560 --> 00:33:42,560
Ooh!

424
00:34:20,150 --> 00:34:22,270
My place is on the top of this building.

425
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:24,150
Are you sure you wanna go up there?

426
00:34:25,350 --> 00:34:26,350
Why?

427
00:34:27,800 --> 00:34:29,800
Don't you want to...?

428
00:35:01,190 --> 00:35:03,800
Walk carefully. It's quite dark here.

429
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,390
Do you have a condom?

430
00:36:06,640 --> 00:36:07,680
Let me borrow it.

431
00:36:17,840 --> 00:36:18,840
Wait, you're a top?

432
00:36:36,680 --> 00:36:38,520
Then, I should go home now. / Hey, wait.

433
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:41,840
Wait for the rain to stop and go home later.

434
00:36:41,840 --> 00:36:43,640
It's still raining outside.

435
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:47,560
Are you sure?

436
00:37:21,680 --> 00:37:23,920
Well, I don't know if you'll be able to eat that.

437
00:37:23,920 --> 00:37:25,560
This is what left in the fridge.

438
00:37:25,920 --> 00:37:27,520
You haven't had anything, right?

439
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:31,430
Oh, wait, one sec.

440
00:37:35,430 --> 00:37:36,430
Here.

441
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:40,920
This is my recipe.

442
00:38:00,470 --> 00:38:04,000
Slow down, you'll choke.

443
00:38:05,880 --> 00:38:06,880
This is good.

444
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:10,190
I think you're starving.

445
00:38:16,030 --> 00:38:17,030
You're not eating?

446
00:38:17,840 --> 00:38:20,880
Go ahead. Seeing you eat makes me full already.

447
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:24,600
You know your way with words.
You must've had lots of people eating here.

448
00:38:25,390 --> 00:38:26,800
Well, it'd be nice to have what you said.

449
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:28,800
I've eaten alone for years.

450
00:38:31,030 --> 00:38:33,000
Then why do you have it? A condom.

451
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:34,840
Well, just in case, you never know.

452
00:38:35,150 --> 00:38:39,470
And, when time comes that I can use it, someone took it from me.

453
00:38:47,110 --> 00:38:48,190
Easy.

454
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:49,270
Some water.

455
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:54,920
Eat a lot.

456
00:38:55,070 --> 00:38:58,520
You came up here. Even you're not fucked, at least you're full.

457
00:39:06,800 --> 00:39:07,560
Joe.

458
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,560
Huh?

459
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,760
Can I spend a night here?

460
00:39:40,560 --> 00:39:44,030
Can you sleep? My pillow is a little hard.

461
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:49,640
What about you? You can switch places with me.

462
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:52,270
Oh, no need to.

463
00:39:52,270 --> 00:39:54,230
You should sleep in my bed.

464
00:39:54,960 --> 00:39:57,760
I know a guy like you never sleeps on the floor.

465
00:39:59,920 --> 00:40:00,920
Yeah.

466
00:40:12,230 --> 00:40:14,150
Why don't you come up here?

467
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:17,270
It's alright. Go ahead. I'm fine here.

468
00:40:17,800 --> 00:40:18,800
C'mon.

469
00:40:19,600 --> 00:40:21,110
Or do you want me to go down there?

470
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:47,350
Seriously, I don't even know your name.

471
00:40:50,680 --> 00:40:51,760
It's Ming.

472
00:40:53,840 --> 00:40:57,840
And...when I wake up, will I still see you?

473
00:40:59,310 --> 00:41:01,880
Normally, I'm not that mean to my sleeping partner.

474
00:41:05,310 --> 00:41:07,350
But we're no sleeping partners.

475
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:10,520
That's true.

476
00:41:12,600 --> 00:41:14,960
Actually, I'm not serious with the position, Ming.

477
00:41:16,190 --> 00:41:20,390
But...I've just never tried it.

478
00:41:25,430 --> 00:41:27,070
That means...

479
00:41:28,000 --> 00:41:30,270
I almost got to be your first one?

480
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:36,640
Yeah.

481
00:41:47,680 --> 00:41:50,800
You should save it for the one you're serious with.

482
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,760
Don't lose it with a guy like me.

483
00:42:01,840 --> 00:42:05,760
And...Ming, don't you have someone you'd like to get serious with?

484
00:42:07,430 --> 00:42:08,430
Ha.

485
00:42:11,470 --> 00:42:13,310
But from what I see,

486
00:42:13,310 --> 00:42:15,720
I think you seem to have lots of people hitting on you.

487
00:42:22,680 --> 00:42:25,470
I'm sleepy. I'm gonna sleep now.

488
00:44:24,270 --> 00:44:25,760
If it wasn't for Ming's perfume,

489
00:44:25,760 --> 00:44:27,390
that's still with me,

490
00:44:34,680 --> 00:44:36,470
I probably would think that all of this...

491
00:44:38,880 --> 00:44:40,880
was just a dream.

492
00:45:45,270 --> 00:45:46,470
Just leave it like that, Deuan.

493
00:45:47,560 --> 00:45:50,600
I wanna rest now. You should get some rest too.

494
00:45:50,600 --> 00:45:52,110
Yes, if you'd like something else, Mr. Ming,

495
00:45:52,110 --> 00:45:53,720
please call me anytime.

496
00:46:12,880 --> 00:46:14,600
I said I wanted to rest.

497
00:46:19,000 --> 00:46:19,960
Tong.

498
00:46:20,150 --> 00:46:21,600
So you're back, naughty boy?

499
00:46:23,070 --> 00:46:24,070
Yes.

500
00:46:25,230 --> 00:46:28,070
So where were you last night?

501
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,350
Do you know that May was worried about you?

502
00:46:31,600 --> 00:46:34,680
Oh, I met with an old friend.

503
00:46:34,680 --> 00:46:36,680
We haven't met for a long time, so...

504
00:46:37,350 --> 00:46:39,110
I was wasted and passed out.

505
00:46:41,470 --> 00:46:43,640
So you chose your friend over me?

506
00:46:45,030 --> 00:46:46,190
I'm sorry.

507
00:46:48,270 --> 00:46:51,520
Tonight, May's gotta go to work.

508
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,680
After I finish shooting, I'll treat you a meal.

509
00:46:55,600 --> 00:46:57,600
This time, do not take a rain check.

510
00:46:59,640 --> 00:47:00,640
Absolutely.

511
00:47:09,270 --> 00:47:10,350
Here you go.

512
00:47:10,520 --> 00:47:11,560
Thanks, Jo.

513
00:47:12,470 --> 00:47:13,760
Only eggplants, right?

514
00:47:13,920 --> 00:47:14,640
That's alright.

515
00:47:14,640 --> 00:47:16,350
Just kidding. Take one chicken's foot.

516
00:47:16,350 --> 00:47:17,520
Oh, thank you.

517
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:18,720
Of course!

518
00:47:19,640 --> 00:47:20,470
Do you want more?

519
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,310
Yes.

520
00:47:21,310 --> 00:47:22,310
You got it!

521
00:47:23,230 --> 00:47:24,760
I'll give you another blood jelly.

522
00:47:28,600 --> 00:47:29,640
What's wrong with you, Joe?

523
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:33,310
This is my wife's rice noodle stew.

524
00:47:33,840 --> 00:47:36,190
My wife was stewing this all night.

525
00:47:36,560 --> 00:47:37,960
It smells so good. Why don't you have it?

526
00:47:37,960 --> 00:47:39,310
C'mon, quickly, it'll run out.

527
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,190
You go ahead, thank you.

528
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:42,230
I'm not really hungry today.

529
00:47:43,600 --> 00:47:45,760
Shit, you look sad.

530
00:47:46,350 --> 00:47:47,270
Are you heartbroken?

531
00:47:47,720 --> 00:47:48,600
Who is it?

532
00:47:49,720 --> 00:47:52,640
That sweetie, cutie extra?

533
00:47:53,560 --> 00:47:56,030
Man, you don't know Joe's type at all.

534
00:47:57,150 --> 00:47:58,150
How?

535
00:47:58,840 --> 00:48:00,030
What type?

536
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:18,430
Four years went so fast.

537
00:48:19,310 --> 00:48:22,520
I still remember the day I sent you off at the airport.

538
00:48:22,800 --> 00:48:25,070
That day, May cried.

539
00:48:25,070 --> 00:48:27,000
It seemed like you were about to go to war.

540
00:48:29,680 --> 00:48:31,150
And how about you, Tong?

541
00:48:31,150 --> 00:48:35,030
Me? I'm fine.

542
00:48:36,150 --> 00:48:40,000
But, you know, the work in this industry isn't stable.

543
00:48:40,880 --> 00:48:43,430
I'm thinking about doing something else.

544
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:49,800
I meant, how about you and May?

545
00:48:51,430 --> 00:48:53,430
Things with May?

546
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:56,680
Right now, it's good.

547
00:48:57,560 --> 00:49:00,600
I'm helping May out with her cake shop.

548
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:06,110
Do you know how uneasy your sister is?

549
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,000
Right now, I gotta live at her place.

550
00:49:10,720 --> 00:49:13,430
That's good, so she won't be too tired.

551
00:49:13,920 --> 00:49:16,000
And how about you?

552
00:49:18,390 --> 00:49:19,390
I...

553
00:49:24,230 --> 00:49:27,960
Speaking of the devil...she's calling me.

554
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,920
Hello.

555
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:32,920
Yeah, I'm having dinner with Ming.

556
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:36,070
I feel a little sick.

557
00:49:37,110 --> 00:49:39,720
Really? Have you taken any medicine?

558
00:49:40,390 --> 00:49:43,110
Yeah, but I'm not feeling better.

559
00:49:43,110 --> 00:49:46,190
If you don't feel better, call me right away, alright?

560
00:49:46,190 --> 00:49:48,920
Okay, got it.

561
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:55,350
That was May.

562
00:49:55,350 --> 00:49:57,840
She's having a headache so she called

563
00:49:57,840 --> 00:50:00,760
to ask if I could go home early, something like that.

564
00:50:04,110 --> 00:50:06,800
Then you should leave. I'm stuffed.

565
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:10,150
Are you sure?

566
00:50:10,150 --> 00:50:12,000
Yes, go take care of May.

567
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:13,960
I'm fine. I can find a ride home.

568
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:21,000
Then, next time, I'll treat you with another meal, alright?

569
00:50:21,470 --> 00:50:23,270
And I'll bring May here too.

570
00:50:23,270 --> 00:50:24,600
So we can all be together.

571
00:50:25,680 --> 00:50:26,880
Sounds good?

572
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:28,000
Sure.

573
00:50:34,470 --> 00:50:35,470
See you around.

574
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,030
I'm done.

575
00:51:22,470 --> 00:51:23,430
Guys, I'm done.

576
00:51:23,430 --> 00:51:24,430
One sec, babe.

577
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:25,350
Thank you.

578
00:51:25,350 --> 00:51:26,110
Go home safely.

579
00:51:26,110 --> 00:51:27,110
I will.

580
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:33,390
Hello.

581
00:51:33,560 --> 00:51:34,720
Is this Joe?

582
00:51:35,470 --> 00:51:37,520
Yes, who is this?

583
00:51:37,840 --> 00:51:40,350
It's Ming. Are you busy?

584
00:51:54,920 --> 00:51:57,070
Sorry, Ming. Were you waiting for long?

585
00:51:58,840 --> 00:52:00,960
And where did you get my number?

586
00:52:01,470 --> 00:52:02,640
Not telling ya.

587
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:05,880
Ming.

588
00:52:07,600 --> 00:52:08,600
Are you drunk?

589
00:52:10,190 --> 00:52:11,190
Nope.

590
00:52:12,230 --> 00:52:14,150
If you wanna eat something, just order.

591
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,350
Whoa, just all of that is more than enough.

592
00:52:20,350 --> 00:52:23,560
And...isn't this room a little too big?

593
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:25,960
I think it's way too big.

594
00:52:25,960 --> 00:52:26,920
You talk so much.

595
00:52:27,680 --> 00:52:29,110
I told you to order, then order.

596
00:52:57,960 --> 00:53:01,520
I thought you'd forgotten about me.

597
00:53:08,390 --> 00:53:12,030
And you, have you forgotten about me?

598
00:53:17,680 --> 00:53:19,030
What do you think?

599
00:53:21,470 --> 00:53:23,720
From what I see...

600
00:53:24,640 --> 00:53:26,720
you can't forget about me, can you?

601
00:53:34,840 --> 00:53:35,960
What would you like to have?

602
00:53:37,350 --> 00:53:40,030
Oh, just a sec, please.

603
00:53:40,030 --> 00:53:43,310
It's my first time here, so I don't know what to order.

604
00:53:52,470 --> 00:53:53,470
Stop being so stiff.

605
00:53:56,230 --> 00:53:59,560
What are you staring at? Go get us some drinks.

606
00:54:20,150 --> 00:54:22,150
Have you decided?

607
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,000
Easy.

608
00:54:29,000 --> 00:54:30,000
Huh?

609
00:54:30,560 --> 00:54:32,070
Walk straight, Ming.

610
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,030
You told me you weren't drunk.

611
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,070
I'm not drunk.

612
00:55:04,640 --> 00:55:05,800
Where are you going?

613
00:55:07,960 --> 00:55:09,000
To shower.

614
00:55:40,110 --> 00:55:42,110
So you chose your friend over me?

615
00:55:43,030 --> 00:55:44,030
I'm sorry.

616
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:47,000
Then I'm gonna get going.

617
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:27,350
Ming.

618
00:56:33,070 --> 00:56:34,070
Ming!

619
00:56:38,760 --> 00:56:40,000
I know.

620
00:56:46,640 --> 00:56:49,110
Why do you have to be a virgin?

621
00:56:54,720 --> 00:56:56,760
If you were to be my first one...

622
00:56:57,350 --> 00:56:58,960
I wouldn't deny that.

623
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:52,880
Then, I felt like I was in a dream.

624
00:58:55,880 --> 00:58:58,960
Without knowing that it was a nightmare.

625
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:01,390
And this person...

626
00:59:01,390 --> 00:59:03,880
Is the one who caused me to die.
