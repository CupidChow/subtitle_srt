00:00:06,256 --> 00:00:08,884
A MODEL LEAVES THE STAGE AFTER THE JUDGING
Can I see your makeup?

2
00:00:08,967 --> 00:00:11,053
- Sorry?
- Can I see your makeup?

3
00:00:11,136 --> 00:00:12,179
- Sure.
- He's checking her makeup.

4
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:13,347
Let's go. I want to see it, too.

5
00:00:13,430 --> 00:00:14,806
- Let's join them.
- Me too.

6
00:00:19,102 --> 00:00:20,938
- Even the base makeup is amazing.
- You're right.

7
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:22,356
- Seriously.
- The brows!

8
00:00:22,439 --> 00:00:24,191
- That's incredible.
- Everything is on point.

9
00:00:24,274 --> 00:00:25,442
- It looks stunning.
- It's a vibe.

10
00:00:25,526 --> 00:00:26,443
<i>Bravo.</i>

11
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,111
She deserves a round of applause.

12
00:00:30,113 --> 00:00:31,448
She's excellent.

13
00:00:31,657 --> 00:00:33,909
It wasn't just chills.

14
00:00:34,284 --> 00:00:36,912
<i>I was thoroughly shocked by her skills.</i>

15
00:00:36,995 --> 00:00:39,206
<i>I was deeply inspired.</i>

16
00:00:39,289 --> 00:00:40,958
What was that? It blew me away!

17
00:00:41,041 --> 00:00:42,543
<i>When she was doing the makeup,</i>

18
00:00:42,626 --> 00:00:45,212
<i>I hid in the corner</i>
<i>and watched her for 40 minutes.</i>

19
00:00:45,295 --> 00:00:48,840
Because I can't watch her work
in Korea otherwise.

20
00:00:49,091 --> 00:00:50,676
I've been a huge fan for a long time.

21
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:51,927
And I finally saw her today!

22
00:00:52,052 --> 00:00:54,680
A colleague told me she'd be here,

23
00:00:54,763 --> 00:00:57,266
but I assumed she'd be a judge.

24
00:00:58,475 --> 00:00:59,476
I'm stunned.

25
00:01:00,102 --> 00:01:01,228
Don't get nervous.

26
00:01:01,311 --> 00:01:03,897
Relax my shoulders.
I can't let my shoulders look so tense!

27
00:01:04,856 --> 00:01:07,401
Hello, I'm a makeup artist in Paris,

28
00:01:07,484 --> 00:01:10,028
Golden Hand in Paris.

29
00:01:10,112 --> 00:01:12,114
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

30
00:01:12,197 --> 00:01:14,533
I worked with Margaret Qualley,
the female lead

31
00:01:14,616 --> 00:01:19,079
MARGARET QUALLEY
on the recent film, The Substance.

32
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:21,248
LILY-ROSE DEPP
I've also recently started working

33
00:01:21,331 --> 00:01:23,584
<i>with Lily-Rose Depp in Europe.</i>

34
00:01:23,667 --> 00:01:25,168
I've worked with many brands,

35
00:01:25,252 --> 00:01:28,463
such as Chanel, Louis Vuitton,
Yves Saint Laurent, and more.

36
00:01:28,547 --> 00:01:30,257
<i>I still work with many others.</i>

37
00:01:31,633 --> 00:01:34,094
<i>I prepare magazine photoshoots,</i>
<i>work with celebrities,</i>

38
00:01:34,177 --> 00:01:37,848
<i>work for fashion projects,</i>
<i>advertisements, shows,</i>

39
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,850
<i>and take on all sorts of other projects.</i>

40
00:01:40,267 --> 00:01:43,604
<i>So I don't fear any model,</i>
<i>no matter who's sitting in front of me.</i>

41
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:45,355
<i>I don't feel any pressure.</i>

42
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:51,778
<i>I need to rank high enough</i>
<i>for my family to remember it.</i>

43
00:01:51,862 --> 00:01:53,363
<i>I want to do really well.</i>

44
00:01:54,364 --> 00:01:55,782
Her lighting is so bright.

45
00:01:55,866 --> 00:01:58,702
Oh, she has her own lights on!

46
00:01:59,077 --> 00:02:00,662
No wonder.

47
00:02:00,746 --> 00:02:03,290
I should've brought them, too.
She's clever.

48
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:05,667
That's putting in effort.

49
00:02:06,710 --> 00:02:08,420
I can't wait for the final look.

50
00:02:08,503 --> 00:02:09,630
Me neither.

51
00:02:10,839 --> 00:02:12,633
- I wonder what she'll do.
- Me too.

52
00:02:17,387 --> 00:02:19,431
Can I go behind you? I can, right?

53
00:02:22,934 --> 00:02:23,894
Oh, my!

54
00:02:24,394 --> 00:02:25,604
- Is this okay?
- A massage.

55
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:33,820
It's practically a beauty salon.

56
00:02:34,738 --> 00:02:37,074
That'll certainly give
a nice glow to her skin.

57
00:02:37,157 --> 00:02:39,534
- Right. Her skin already looks better.
- With relaxed muscles.

58
00:02:39,618 --> 00:02:40,994
It must be the massage.

59
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,829
She's even massaging her body.

60
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,706
- That'll make her
- Down to her neck.

61
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:47,167
- look much more refreshed,
- It's good for the blood flow.

62
00:02:47,250 --> 00:02:48,543
making her facial shape look extra good.

63
00:02:48,627 --> 00:02:50,045
That'll make the makeup look even better.

64
00:02:50,128 --> 00:02:51,004
For sure.

65
00:02:51,922 --> 00:02:53,006
Could you open your eyes?

66
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,258
Your eyes are glowing now!

67
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,221
<i>I massaged her face and neck first.</i>

68
00:02:59,304 --> 00:03:03,392
<i>Then because the look I was going for</i>
<i>needed her skin to look clear,</i>

69
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,019
<i>I applied the base makeup</i>

70
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,312
<i>all the way to her arms.</i>

71
00:03:07,396 --> 00:03:08,855
<i>That way, her face would match her body,</i>

72
00:03:08,939 --> 00:03:12,234
<i>and it would balance out the shine,</i>
<i>which I think is crucial.</i>

73
00:03:14,861 --> 00:03:16,446
Can you look at me? Yes.

74
00:03:19,116 --> 00:03:21,034
She's applying black lipstick.

75
00:03:21,118 --> 00:03:22,119
Really?

76
00:03:26,873 --> 00:03:27,833
Let's see.

77
00:03:31,253 --> 00:03:34,172
I have a feeling it'll be heart-shaped.

78
00:03:35,298 --> 00:03:37,384
I bet she'll make

79
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:39,386
some sort of shape.

80
00:03:39,469 --> 00:03:40,679
What is that?

81
00:03:40,804 --> 00:03:43,640
That's amazing.
I didn't see that coming at all.

82
00:03:45,976 --> 00:03:49,479
You can really see her unique touches.

83
00:03:49,688 --> 00:03:50,981
This is so...

84
00:03:51,064 --> 00:03:53,108
- She's something else.
- It's so much fun to watch her.

85
00:03:53,275 --> 00:03:54,526
<i>The lips were the focus</i>

86
00:03:54,609 --> 00:03:57,779
<i>since the planning stage of my makeup.</i>

87
00:03:57,863 --> 00:04:01,783
<i>So, I lined her lips with black lipstick.</i>

88
00:04:04,786 --> 00:04:06,288
What's that black thing?

89
00:04:06,371 --> 00:04:07,873
It's glistening.

90
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,207
It looks like a special sticker.

91
00:04:09,291 --> 00:04:12,502
- A really thin, film sheet-like sticker.
- Yes.

92
00:04:20,010 --> 00:04:24,222
<i>I put plastic foil on her lips</i>
<i>to decorate them.</i>

93
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,225
It already looks beautiful.

94
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:28,769
- It feels like a fashion show.
- Yes.

95
00:04:29,853 --> 00:04:31,980
It definitely looks
like a fashion show look.

96
00:04:36,318 --> 00:04:38,528
Like this. All done. We're almost done.

97
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,532
Next, I'll put this patch on you.

98
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:47,746
Should I place it here?

99
00:04:47,829 --> 00:04:48,705
Sure.

100
00:04:51,875 --> 00:04:53,794
What is she putting on her face?

101
00:04:53,877 --> 00:04:56,171
You can stick it on the sides,

102
00:04:56,254 --> 00:04:59,132
and the strings can give a lifting effect.

103
00:04:59,216 --> 00:05:00,634
She must be pulling her eyes up.

104
00:05:01,134 --> 00:05:03,595
My gosh! That's crazy.

105
00:05:04,346 --> 00:05:05,680
Like this, right?

106
00:05:05,889 --> 00:05:07,891
- This is okay, right? How do you feel?
- Yes.

107
00:05:08,892 --> 00:05:10,227
- Is it pulling?
- Yes.

108
00:05:11,019 --> 00:05:12,979
How do you feel?
Do your eyes look symmetrical?

109
00:05:13,855 --> 00:05:16,191
She's even checking the symmetry.

110
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:18,443
It's incredible.

111
00:05:23,406 --> 00:05:24,950
That looks like a piece of laver.

112
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:27,035
What is that for?

113
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:31,414
It's to secure the lifting tape.

114
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:35,377
- This also looks good, right?
- Yes.

115
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:37,796
This looks better on you.

116
00:05:38,755 --> 00:05:39,840
I'll put this on, then.

117
00:05:40,215 --> 00:05:43,176
<i>I prepared a very simple design</i>
<i>for the eyes,</i>

118
00:05:43,260 --> 00:05:45,554
<i>but I wanted to keep that graphic theme.</i>

119
00:05:45,637 --> 00:05:49,432
<i>I felt like I needed to add something,</i>

120
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,060
<i>so I prepared some patches.</i>

121
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,481
<i>Then, I got to contouring.</i>

122
00:05:56,690 --> 00:05:58,859
<i>I contoured her face in straight lines</i>

123
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:02,320
<i>to fit the lips and the eye shapes</i>
<i>with a focus on smooth blending.</i>

124
00:06:04,072 --> 00:06:05,991
She's applying blush along the edges.

125
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:09,870
<i>Lastly, I added some gloss on her eyes</i>

126
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,788
<i>to ensure you could see sparkles</i>

127
00:06:11,872 --> 00:06:14,666
- from every angle.
- Open your eyes.

128
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,252
What a delicate look full of details.

129
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:20,005
It's impressive
that she's prepared this look

130
00:06:20,088 --> 00:06:22,132
- as her signature look for Round One.
- I know.

131
00:06:22,215 --> 00:06:24,801
I wanted to create a look
to make people curious.

132
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:26,887
<i>"This is totally art,</i>

133
00:06:26,970 --> 00:06:29,306
<i>but I want to try that element on myself."</i>

134
00:06:29,472 --> 00:06:30,515
<i>How fun is that?</i>

135
00:06:34,686 --> 00:06:35,687
Great work!

136
00:06:36,146 --> 00:06:38,815
You did so well today. Seriously.

137
00:06:39,316 --> 00:06:41,985
I bet the first lady will definitely pass.

138
00:06:42,068 --> 00:06:43,570
- Undoubtedly.
- She'll absolutely pass.

139
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,155
- No doubt.
- It looks amazing.

140
00:06:45,238 --> 00:06:46,406
Incredible.

141
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:48,617
When applying makeup on someone,

142
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,036
I like to incorporate

143
00:06:51,119 --> 00:06:53,079
opposing textures or shapes

144
00:06:53,163 --> 00:06:55,040
and use different elements

145
00:06:55,123 --> 00:06:57,375
beyond just makeup products.

146
00:06:57,459 --> 00:07:00,337
I imagined the model walking on the runway

147
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:04,341
with a big black diamond on her lips.

148
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,762
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS'S
MIX-AND-MATCH MAKEUP

149
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,264
<i>I thought it'd be boring</i>
<i>to only focus on the lips,</i>

150
00:07:11,348 --> 00:07:13,224
<i>so I used some straight lines.</i>

151
00:07:13,308 --> 00:07:16,186
<i>The graphic lips and contouring,</i>

152
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:19,606
<i>and the shine from the eyes are</i>

153
00:07:19,689 --> 00:07:22,108
<i>all connected to the lip makeup.</i>

154
00:07:22,192 --> 00:07:25,528
<i>I designed the look</i>
<i>to keep the lines coherent.</i>

155
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,957
- It feels like a look from a magazine.
- Right.

156
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,542
She could even be
on the cover of a magazine.

157
00:07:40,085 --> 00:07:41,628
I wouldn't have anything to say.

158
00:07:41,795 --> 00:07:42,712
I know.

159
00:07:42,796 --> 00:07:44,130
There's no critique to be made.

160
00:07:44,923 --> 00:07:47,342
Will it look just as good
with the lights off?

161
00:07:47,425 --> 00:07:48,718
- Should I turn them off?
- Yes.

162
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:50,971
I'm scared.

163
00:07:52,806 --> 00:07:54,349
I bet it'll look even more amazing.

164
00:07:54,683 --> 00:07:56,559
You can keep that on.

165
00:07:56,935 --> 00:07:57,769
Yes.

166
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,779
It's a yes from me.

167
00:08:07,946 --> 00:08:09,948
It's a yes from me.

168
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:11,408
Thank you.

169
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,618
I love you.

170
00:08:13,785 --> 00:08:15,161
It's absolutely stunning!

171
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,330
- Thank you!
- You really outdid yourself.

172
00:08:17,414 --> 00:08:19,165
- It's a yes from me as well.
- A yes, right?

173
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,500
- Yes, congratulations!
- Yes.

174
00:08:20,583 --> 00:08:21,835
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

175
00:08:21,918 --> 00:08:22,961
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS PASSES

176
00:08:23,586 --> 00:08:25,797
Golden Hand in Paris has passed.

177
00:08:25,880 --> 00:08:27,090
Congratulations.

178
00:08:29,676 --> 00:08:31,428
That was an incredible look.

179
00:08:32,095 --> 00:08:33,847
She should've been a judge.

180
00:08:34,597 --> 00:08:36,016
It was so amazing.

181
00:08:37,142 --> 00:08:38,393
She's a favorite to win.

182
00:08:39,269 --> 00:08:42,731
Golden Hand in Paris, I love you!

183
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,401
<i>She understood</i>
<i>the model's facial structure,</i>

184
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:48,820
<i>and the process in which</i>
<i>she added colors to her face</i>

185
00:08:48,903 --> 00:08:51,031
<i>made her intentions behind the look</i>

186
00:08:51,114 --> 00:08:52,991
<i>so clear to understand.</i>

187
00:08:53,074 --> 00:08:55,493
<i>It was just perfect.</i>

188
00:08:55,577 --> 00:08:57,454
<i>I had nothing else to say.</i>

189
00:09:02,292 --> 00:09:03,126
Oh, my.

190
00:09:04,461 --> 00:09:05,670
This is nerve-wracking.

191
00:09:05,962 --> 00:09:07,297
I'm very determined.

192
00:09:07,714 --> 00:09:10,508
GENIE OF 37 YEARS

193
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:12,927
Oh, man.

194
00:09:20,310 --> 00:09:23,605
Could you explain the look to us?

195
00:09:23,855 --> 00:09:24,981
Today...

196
00:09:35,867 --> 00:09:37,827
Don't cry.

197
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,207
No, I shouldn't be like this.

198
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,500
I'll cover you.

199
00:09:49,506 --> 00:09:50,965
<i>Do I have to call her Genie?</i>

200
00:09:51,049 --> 00:09:54,010
It's hard to call her that.
I'm so used to calling her, "Ms. Kim."

201
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:58,014
<i>When I first started working</i>
<i>at a makeup boutique,</i>

202
00:09:58,098 --> 00:10:00,350
<i>she was my boss.</i>

203
00:10:00,475 --> 00:10:03,186
So, being on the set
as a judge and a participant

204
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:05,980
made us feel all sorts of emotions.

205
00:10:06,064 --> 00:10:08,274
<i>We were both reminded of our past.</i>

206
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:09,984
We were reminded of the old days.

207
00:10:10,068 --> 00:10:13,154
<i>I still remember those days,</i>
<i>and I always will.</i>

208
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,615
<i>Those tears must've come</i>

209
00:10:15,698 --> 00:10:17,700
from the memories in our heads.

210
00:10:19,661 --> 00:10:21,037
I'm so proud

211
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,164
right now.

212
00:10:23,248 --> 00:10:26,042
I seem to be the oldest here,

213
00:10:29,337 --> 00:10:31,089
so I want to be a strong big sister.

214
00:10:31,172 --> 00:10:36,386
So, I've chosen a bold look
for this round.

215
00:10:36,469 --> 00:10:40,098
I don't just want to be
"the first makeup artist" forever.

216
00:10:40,181 --> 00:10:41,766
That's not what I am.

217
00:10:41,850 --> 00:10:45,812
I want to be remembered
as the strong big sister.

218
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,689
I hope all the artists will become

219
00:10:48,106 --> 00:10:50,233
strong big brothers and sisters.

220
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,944
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

221
00:10:54,154 --> 00:10:55,321
This wasn't what I planned.

222
00:10:55,613 --> 00:10:57,157
Don't cry, boss.

223
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,283
- I'm okay.
- Okay.

224
00:11:00,076 --> 00:11:02,912
It's been a while
since I've worked with clients.

225
00:11:02,996 --> 00:11:05,874
I've mostly been busy running my boutique.

226
00:11:05,957 --> 00:11:09,794
I have wet wipes and tissue,
so no need to get more out.

227
00:11:10,628 --> 00:11:13,089
It finally feels real
now that my station is set up!

228
00:11:14,132 --> 00:11:16,009
I wasn't too confident,

229
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:18,386
so I practiced
a lot more than you'd think.

230
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:21,931
I practiced the look many times
and did my best.

231
00:11:22,015 --> 00:11:26,019
<i>They say your muscle memory</i>
<i>never forgets anything it learns.</i>

232
00:11:26,102 --> 00:11:29,272
So, I'm relying on
my muscle memory to do its job.

233
00:11:31,649 --> 00:11:33,109
GENIE OF 37 YEARS'
STRONG BIG GIRL MAKEUP

234
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:35,695
<i>I wanted to make her look like</i>
<i>a strong woman.</i>

235
00:11:35,778 --> 00:11:39,616
<i>Everyone wants to be</i>
<i>a strong, big girl sometimes.</i>

236
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,784
<i>This is a look you can go for</i>
<i>in such times.</i>

237
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:44,662
<i>I wanted to make her look bolder.</i>

238
00:11:55,965 --> 00:11:56,799
All right.

239
00:12:05,683 --> 00:12:07,977
Genie of 37 Years,

240
00:12:10,146 --> 00:12:11,231
It's...

241
00:12:11,856 --> 00:12:12,941
a no from me.

242
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,026
LEE JIN-SOO: FAIL

243
00:12:15,109 --> 00:12:16,361
To be honest,

244
00:12:17,153 --> 00:12:19,572
I agree that you're a master
and that you've done a great job

245
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:23,534
<i>at paying attention to the fine details</i>
<i>and making the look very presentable.</i>

246
00:12:23,618 --> 00:12:25,995
But I don't think

247
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,998
it looks edgy enough for the theme.

248
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,167
Genie of 37 Years,

249
00:12:35,338 --> 00:12:36,381
It's...

250
00:12:40,218 --> 00:12:41,261
It's...

251
00:12:43,471 --> 00:12:45,014
a no from me.

252
00:12:45,682 --> 00:12:47,600
GENIE OF 37 YEARS IS OUT

253
00:12:47,684 --> 00:12:51,938
I also agree
that your technique is perfect,

254
00:12:52,021 --> 00:12:55,149
but if a tough, charismatic girl
was what you were going for,

255
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:57,944
you should've added more bold elements

256
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:01,030
<i>than just the bold eye makeup.</i>

257
00:13:01,114 --> 00:13:03,700
I feel that your makeup
didn't match your theme well,

258
00:13:03,866 --> 00:13:06,286
which is why it's a no from me.
Thank you for your work.

259
00:13:06,369 --> 00:13:07,704
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

260
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:11,082
Genie of 37 Years has been eliminated.

261
00:13:11,165 --> 00:13:13,751
Please take your brush and exit the arena.

262
00:13:13,918 --> 00:13:15,086
Thank you.

263
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:21,301
Oh, goodness.

264
00:13:25,054 --> 00:13:27,223
<i>I would have regretted it either way,</i>
<i>whether I came or not.</i>

265
00:13:27,598 --> 00:13:31,269
<i>So, I thought it'd be better to regret it</i>
<i>after giving it a chance.</i>

266
00:13:33,896 --> 00:13:35,523
<i>I hope that when my junior colleagues</i>

267
00:13:35,606 --> 00:13:39,319
experience the ups and downs like me,

268
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:43,573
they'll become stronger artists
through those experiences.

269
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:50,580
RISABAE worked for Genie's boutique.

270
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,749
And she had to judge her ex-boss's work,

271
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,168
only to have her get eliminated.

272
00:13:55,251 --> 00:13:56,252
I see.

273
00:13:56,878 --> 00:13:59,922
Now, there's Pure Witch,

274
00:14:01,049 --> 00:14:03,676
whom Seo Ok must judge.

275
00:14:03,760 --> 00:14:05,928
- I see.
- Yes.

276
00:14:06,137 --> 00:14:09,182
I wonder what will happen to Pure Witch.

277
00:14:10,850 --> 00:14:13,895
PURE WITCH
I'm Pure Witch, a makeup artist.

278
00:14:14,520 --> 00:14:16,022
<i>I've been in the field for a long time.</i>

279
00:14:16,105 --> 00:14:19,567
<i>I've been a makeup artist</i>
<i>in Cheongdam-dong alone for over 20 years.</i>

280
00:14:19,692 --> 00:14:21,235
I have so many junior colleagues.

281
00:14:21,569 --> 00:14:25,073
Like Seo Ok, the judge.

282
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:26,199
She was my student.

283
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:29,702
I taught her
since the start of her career.

284
00:14:29,786 --> 00:14:30,870
Please welcome Seo Ok.

285
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,085
<i>We were both astounded.</i>

286
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:41,964
I spotted Ms. Choi immediately.

287
00:14:42,465 --> 00:14:44,509
I learned all my skills from her

288
00:14:44,675 --> 00:14:47,804
since my baby days.

289
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,307
Could I really judge her?

290
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,477
It should be fun.

291
00:14:56,312 --> 00:14:57,814
Hello, Ms. Choi.

292
00:14:58,231 --> 00:14:59,482
Hello.

293
00:15:00,942 --> 00:15:04,237
Do we get to see
your signature look today?

294
00:15:04,695 --> 00:15:07,073
Yes, I guess so.

295
00:15:07,156 --> 00:15:08,825
Today,

296
00:15:09,367 --> 00:15:10,576
PURE WITCH'S NATURAL CONTOURING MAKEUP
I'm preparing a natural makeup

297
00:15:10,660 --> 00:15:12,829
with an emphasis on contouring.

298
00:15:12,912 --> 00:15:15,498
I figured that would look good
on the model.

299
00:15:15,957 --> 00:15:19,085
I know you're the best at that,
so I can't wait to see it.

300
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:20,670
- Thank you.
- Yes.

301
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,424
I'm sure Seo Ok will like my work.

302
00:15:25,883 --> 00:15:29,095
All the boutique shop directors
seem to be going for a natural look.

303
00:15:30,388 --> 00:15:34,350
<i>The makeup will look natural,</i>
<i>but it'll still be a lot of makeup.</i>

304
00:15:35,059 --> 00:15:36,394
<i>You must think about every aspect</i>

305
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,646
<i>when it comes to a natural makeup look.</i>

306
00:15:39,522 --> 00:15:41,816
<i>From the top of your forehead</i>
<i>to the bottom of your lips.</i>

307
00:15:42,358 --> 00:15:43,943
<i>You can tell when someone's wearing makeup</i>

308
00:15:44,026 --> 00:15:46,696
<i>by looking at her skin glow,</i>
<i>eyeliner, lashes, and her brows.</i>

309
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,281
<i>Nothing is technically natural.</i>

310
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:52,160
<i>I've been in the field for a long time,</i>
<i>and I pay good attention to details.</i>

311
00:15:52,243 --> 00:15:54,370
<i>I know I'm good</i>
<i>at making every move with intentions.</i>

312
00:15:54,537 --> 00:15:57,373
Overall, my goal is to showcase
a very technical look.

313
00:15:57,457 --> 00:15:59,375
<i>I'm here to showcase</i>
<i>the best basics of makeup.</i>

314
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,464
She's so thorough and delicate.

315
00:16:04,547 --> 00:16:06,841
- I know.
- She's incredible.

316
00:16:07,300 --> 00:16:10,303
- Everyone's vibe is...
- She's so experienced.

317
00:16:13,181 --> 00:16:15,308
Is it just me, or is everyone watching me?

318
00:16:15,391 --> 00:16:16,684
Look to the side.

319
00:16:18,478 --> 00:16:20,313
- It must be a lot of pressure.
- I bet.

320
00:16:20,396 --> 00:16:21,898
- I know.
- Everyone's watching her.

321
00:16:23,441 --> 00:16:25,902
What will happen to SOONSOO's legend?

322
00:16:25,985 --> 00:16:26,944
Six,

323
00:16:27,487 --> 00:16:28,488
five...

324
00:16:29,906 --> 00:16:31,115
The judges have arrived.

325
00:16:36,746 --> 00:16:39,415
- Hello, okay.
- Hello, please explain the look.

326
00:16:40,166 --> 00:16:42,668
It's a natural makeup with contouring,

327
00:16:42,752 --> 00:16:45,838
<i>　so I've named it</i>
<i>"Natural Contouring Makeup."</i>

328
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:48,674
PURE WITCH'S NATURAL CONTOURING MAKEUP
I added depth to her eyes with contouring

329
00:16:48,758 --> 00:16:50,384
<i>and a bit of attention on her lashes,</i>

330
00:16:50,468 --> 00:16:54,514
<i>adding just enough product</i>
<i>to make it easy for her to blink her eyes.</i>

331
00:16:55,097 --> 00:16:58,100
I trimmed her brows

332
00:16:58,184 --> 00:16:59,936
<i>to make them symmetrical.</i>

333
00:17:00,102 --> 00:17:04,273
<i>The brows have been designed</i>
<i>to suit her face best.</i>

334
00:17:04,398 --> 00:17:09,946
Overall, I wanted more attention
on the eye makeup with glowing skin.

335
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,616
She did a very clean job.

336
00:17:15,493 --> 00:17:17,620
It looks natural.

337
00:17:21,832 --> 00:17:23,626
Did you glue individual lashes on?

338
00:17:23,709 --> 00:17:24,585
Yes.

339
00:17:34,303 --> 00:17:35,596
Pure Witch,

340
00:17:37,139 --> 00:17:39,475
to be honest,
I was really excited for your work.

341
00:17:39,559 --> 00:17:40,601
Yes.

342
00:17:42,562 --> 00:17:44,897
It's a no from me.

343
00:17:44,981 --> 00:17:47,275
JUNG SAEM-MOOL: FAIL

344
00:17:47,358 --> 00:17:48,985
- It's a no from me.
- Oh, my goodness.

345
00:17:50,111 --> 00:17:51,904
The colors, skin texture,

346
00:17:51,988 --> 00:17:54,407
<i>and contouring</i>

347
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,409
were too ordinary

348
00:17:56,492 --> 00:18:00,162
that the look didn't meet my expectations.

349
00:18:02,873 --> 00:18:04,333
It's a tough call.

350
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,336
It's a very tough call.

351
00:18:10,214 --> 00:18:12,425
<i>I told myself to be objective.</i>

352
00:18:12,883 --> 00:18:15,886
<i>I had to have the same standards</i>
<i>when judging everyone.</i>

353
00:18:16,554 --> 00:18:18,180
<i>What do I do if I get eliminated now?</i>

354
00:18:18,264 --> 00:18:20,016
<i>Seriously, what do I do?</i>

355
00:18:21,142 --> 00:18:23,144
Pure Witch,

356
00:18:23,519 --> 00:18:25,396
Pure Witch,

357
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,440
it's a yes from me.

358
00:18:27,523 --> 00:18:28,983
PURE WITCH IS ON HOLD
Yes.

359
00:18:29,066 --> 00:18:30,735
First,

360
00:18:30,818 --> 00:18:33,487
you've done an excellent job
at making every feature stand out.

361
00:18:33,904 --> 00:18:35,323
<i>It wasn't too flashy</i>

362
00:18:35,406 --> 00:18:38,117
<i>or full of colors</i>
<i>that would've changed her natural face.</i>

363
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,536
<i>Instead, you worked</i>
<i>with the model's natural beauty</i>

364
00:18:40,620 --> 00:18:42,204
<i>and only accentuated it.</i>

365
00:18:42,413 --> 00:18:46,292
<i>And when I saw the model's face</i>
<i>before your makeup,</i>

366
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:48,794
<i>I noticed that her natural brows</i>
<i>were quite bold</i>

367
00:18:48,878 --> 00:18:50,630
<i>and looked a bit aggressive.</i>

368
00:18:50,713 --> 00:18:53,466
<i>But you did a great job</i>

369
00:18:53,549 --> 00:18:56,052
<i>at making them look soft, which I commend.</i>

370
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,596
And I expect no less from you

371
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:00,306
that you'll also be able
to pull off a flashier look

372
00:19:00,389 --> 00:19:02,642
for the next round
instead of a natural look.

373
00:19:02,725 --> 00:19:04,101
With that in mind, it's a yes from me.

374
00:19:05,061 --> 00:19:06,395
Thank you for your work.

375
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:14,070
It's not easy.

376
00:19:15,404 --> 00:19:18,282
<i>I felt so small, standing there.</i>

377
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,742
<i>I felt so pathetic.</i>

378
00:19:20,117 --> 00:19:21,327
<i>I underestimated this.</i>

379
00:19:21,410 --> 00:19:23,913
I should have put in a lot more effort.

380
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,082
And I promised I'd do my absolute best

381
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:27,958
if I got lucky and advanced to Round Two.

382
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,752
<i>I really reflected on my attitude.</i>

383
00:19:33,297 --> 00:19:36,258
He got the airbrush out!

384
00:19:36,509 --> 00:19:38,094
That's so cool.

385
00:19:38,427 --> 00:19:40,930
- Everyone came so prepared.
- I know.

386
00:19:41,472 --> 00:19:42,723
Look, it's a straw.

387
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,893
- I saw that.
- She brought her own lights.

388
00:19:46,268 --> 00:19:48,896
She prepared extra lights.
What a great idea.

389
00:19:49,730 --> 00:19:50,981
The giant puff.

390
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,191
She must've brought that.

391
00:19:54,110 --> 00:19:55,444
She brought feathers.

392
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:57,822
- She made the prop herself.
- No way.

393
00:20:00,616 --> 00:20:02,159
Is that a portable stove?

394
00:20:02,243 --> 00:20:04,662
- Yes, she's melting wax.
- In a pot!

395
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:08,499
That's a stove!
Are you cooking for your model?

396
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,042
That's quite something.

397
00:20:12,795 --> 00:20:14,630
- What is that?
- A pot?

398
00:20:16,590 --> 00:20:18,634
- She even brought a cooler.
- No way.

399
00:20:22,596 --> 00:20:23,931
It must be for special effects makeup.

400
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:25,808
I think I know who she is.

401
00:20:27,309 --> 00:20:28,728
NEVER DEAD QUEEN

402
00:20:28,811 --> 00:20:30,563
<i>There's something only I excel at.</i>

403
00:20:30,646 --> 00:20:32,231
<i>Something nobody here can outdo me</i>

404
00:20:32,314 --> 00:20:34,984
<i>when it comes to special effects makeup.</i>

405
00:20:35,985 --> 00:20:39,029
<i>I'm the youngest</i>
<i>special effects makeup artist</i>

406
00:20:39,113 --> 00:20:41,699
<i>and movie director in Korea.</i>

407
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,327
<i>I'm very well-known</i>
<i>as a special effects makeup influencer.</i>

408
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,914
<i>Since my strength is in doing</i>
<i>special effects makeup,</i>

409
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:51,834
I wanted to leave a strong impression.

410
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,003
<i>So, I prepared</i>
<i>a special effects makeup look.</i>

411
00:20:57,423 --> 00:20:58,966
She's always good.

412
00:20:59,300 --> 00:21:00,885
Isn't she super famous?

413
00:21:01,343 --> 00:21:03,596
I wonder what she's going to do.

414
00:21:06,515 --> 00:21:09,435
- Is she boiling blood or something?
- My gosh.

415
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:15,441
<i>First, I prepared a mix</i>

416
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,278
<i>of gelatin, glycerin, and water in a pot.</i>

417
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:22,031
<i>When that gets hot enough,</i>

418
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,532
<i>it melts.</i>

419
00:21:29,538 --> 00:21:33,042
<i>I needed to make slabs</i>
<i>of the skin texture I wanted.</i>

420
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:37,463
<i>We create the slabs</i>
<i>on an acrylic sheet on movie sets.</i>

421
00:21:37,546 --> 00:21:38,464
SLAB MAKEUP

422
00:21:38,547 --> 00:21:40,466
MAKEUP TECHNIQUE USING SILICONE, GELATIN,
ETC, TO APPLY DIRECTLY TO THE SKIN

423
00:21:40,549 --> 00:21:43,219
I also prepared an ice sheet,

424
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,346
which I brought in a cooler.

425
00:21:45,429 --> 00:21:47,306
<i>I placed the acrylic sheet</i>

426
00:21:47,389 --> 00:21:50,768
<i>on the ice sheet for temperature control.</i>

427
00:21:50,851 --> 00:21:53,395
<i>That was how I prepared the skin slabs.</i>

428
00:21:55,022 --> 00:21:57,066
She must be creating fake scars.

429
00:21:57,733 --> 00:21:58,943
That's awesome.

430
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,862
I didn't expect anyone to prepare
a special effects makeup look.

431
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:03,489
In just one hour?

432
00:22:07,493 --> 00:22:10,913
<i>I stuck the prepared slabs on her face.</i>

433
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:13,624
<i>And the edges of the slabs</i>

434
00:22:13,707 --> 00:22:17,837
<i>would've looked too disconnected</i>
<i>without blending them into the skin.</i>

435
00:22:18,838 --> 00:22:20,881
<i>So, to make the slabs</i>
<i>look like a part of her,</i>

436
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:24,385
<i>I used a mix of latex and tissue</i>

437
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:27,096
<i>and applied it along the outlines</i>

438
00:22:27,930 --> 00:22:31,684
<i>to add another texture.</i>

439
00:22:33,561 --> 00:22:35,437
She came so prepared.

440
00:22:36,230 --> 00:22:38,440
Is she trying to make the model
look like a corpse?

441
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:43,863
<i>I started working</i>
<i>on the colors after that.</i>

442
00:22:44,947 --> 00:22:46,699
<i>You must keep the design in mind</i>

443
00:22:46,782 --> 00:22:48,701
<i>and contour the face as you go.</i>

444
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:51,704
<i>It requires a lot of work</i>
<i>on the finest details.</i>

445
00:22:51,871 --> 00:22:55,416
<i>I didn't just use one color for the skin.</i>

446
00:22:56,125 --> 00:22:57,126
<i>I used gel,</i>

447
00:22:57,960 --> 00:22:58,961
<i>cream,</i>

448
00:22:59,628 --> 00:23:01,714
<i>and an alcohol-based palette,</i>

449
00:23:01,797 --> 00:23:04,758
<i>called skin illustrator,</i>

450
00:23:04,842 --> 00:23:07,970
<i>to color her skin in many ways.</i>

451
00:23:10,806 --> 00:23:12,349
My jaw is on the floor.

452
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,769
Special effects makeup artists
are so cool.

453
00:23:16,770 --> 00:23:18,355
Normally, you'd have to pay
tons to see this.

454
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:19,481
I know.

455
00:23:25,779 --> 00:23:28,157
Are you focusing
on special effects makeup today?

456
00:23:28,824 --> 00:23:29,742
Yes, for today.

457
00:23:29,825 --> 00:23:31,285
So, not an aesthetic look?

458
00:23:31,368 --> 00:23:35,956
It's just that an aesthetic look
is far from my signature look.

459
00:23:36,540 --> 00:23:38,417
I can show you an aesthetic look
if I advance to Round Two.

460
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,919
Okay, then.

461
00:23:41,629 --> 00:23:42,671
Got it.

462
00:23:50,679 --> 00:23:52,514
She won't just look sick, right?

463
00:23:53,515 --> 00:23:55,809
I love beautiful things as well.

464
00:23:58,729 --> 00:24:02,650
That suddenly made me think,
"Was I supposed to make her look pretty?"

465
00:24:02,816 --> 00:24:06,070
That made my head go completely blank.

466
00:24:06,737 --> 00:24:08,614
<i>But this was what I'd prepared.</i>

467
00:24:08,697 --> 00:24:13,327
<i>And this look was</i>
<i>how I could express myself.</i>

468
00:24:14,078 --> 00:24:16,080
<i>I didn't want to give up on this look.</i>

469
00:24:18,040 --> 00:24:20,042
<i>I didn't want people to think</i>

470
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:22,836
<i>that I was just</i>
<i>a special effects makeup influencer,</i>

471
00:24:22,920 --> 00:24:24,380
<i>so I was even more desperate to pass.</i>

472
00:24:24,463 --> 00:24:27,383
<i>I wanted to prove my skills.</i>

473
00:24:28,801 --> 00:24:31,345
<i>Eight, seven, six...</i>

474
00:24:31,428 --> 00:24:34,264
- I wonder what the judges will think.
- Me too.

475
00:24:35,891 --> 00:24:37,101
It's the special effects makeup.

476
00:24:37,977 --> 00:24:39,228
Here.

477
00:24:41,522 --> 00:24:44,274
Please explain the look.

478
00:24:44,650 --> 00:24:46,193
This look is called

479
00:24:46,276 --> 00:24:49,863
"The Unforgettable Temperature."

480
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:54,451
THE UNFORGETTABLE TEMPERATURE
Everyone has been in passionate love.

481
00:24:54,535 --> 00:24:57,746
<i>But when that unforgettable love cools,</i>

482
00:24:57,830 --> 00:25:00,541
<i>only the memories remain,</i>

483
00:25:00,624 --> 00:25:03,836
which last a long time, like burn scars.

484
00:25:03,919 --> 00:25:08,257
I wanted these scars to represent
the unforgettable memories of love.

485
00:25:08,674 --> 00:25:11,760
<i>I used gelatin</i>

486
00:25:11,844 --> 00:25:14,805
<i>to create the texture of burn scars,</i>

487
00:25:14,888 --> 00:25:17,266
<i>and the ashes surrounding the scars</i>

488
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:19,852
FAKE DUST
were made with special fake dust,

489
00:25:19,935 --> 00:25:21,687
<i>a special effects makeup product.</i>

490
00:25:21,770 --> 00:25:25,441
<i>I used the product to create dust,</i>

491
00:25:25,774 --> 00:25:28,110
<i>which represents the broken heart.</i>

492
00:25:28,944 --> 00:25:33,157
I prepared this makeup today
with makeup as my love in my mind.

493
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,159
I love it so much,

494
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,703
but if I get eliminated today,

495
00:25:37,786 --> 00:25:40,581
this is how my heart will look.

496
00:25:57,473 --> 00:25:59,058
<i>I was incredibly nervous.</i>

497
00:26:00,100 --> 00:26:01,310
<i>My heart was</i>

498
00:26:01,977 --> 00:26:05,481
<i>ready to jump out of my mouth.</i>

499
00:26:09,318 --> 00:26:10,360
It's a...

500
00:26:12,696 --> 00:26:16,867
<i>What if they eliminate me</i>
<i>because my look isn't aesthetic?</i>

501
00:26:18,869 --> 00:26:20,079
It's a yes from me.

502
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:21,830
Thank you.

503
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:24,792
Firstly, you did a great job

504
00:26:24,875 --> 00:26:26,627
showcasing what you do best.

505
00:26:26,710 --> 00:26:29,588
But it wasn't just your skills
or the mode of expression.

506
00:26:30,214 --> 00:26:31,757
Your story behind the look

507
00:26:32,049 --> 00:26:33,926
was also absolutely amazing.

508
00:26:34,009 --> 00:26:36,053
You didn't just prepare
special effects makeup.

509
00:26:36,136 --> 00:26:39,431
You also prepared a story behind it.

510
00:26:39,515 --> 00:26:42,434
The burn scars are also placed

511
00:26:42,518 --> 00:26:45,729
<i>in perfectly balanced spots</i>
<i>for the model's face.</i>

512
00:26:45,813 --> 00:26:49,233
<i>The colored contact lens</i>
<i>was also just enough.</i>

513
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:51,151
<i>In a way,</i>

514
00:26:51,568 --> 00:26:53,070
it's a very sad and painful look,

515
00:26:53,153 --> 00:26:56,240
but to me, it looks absolutely beautiful.

516
00:26:56,323 --> 00:26:58,534
- So, it's a yes from me.
- Thank you.

517
00:27:01,537 --> 00:27:03,705
- Never Dead Queen.
- Yes.

518
00:27:09,211 --> 00:27:10,671
<i>I was so desperate.</i>

519
00:27:10,879 --> 00:27:13,382
I put my heart and soul
into preparing for this.

520
00:27:13,674 --> 00:27:15,634
I love what I do so much.

521
00:27:16,051 --> 00:27:19,471
<i>I guess I wanted to do well</i>
<i>in what I loved to do.</i>

522
00:27:22,850 --> 00:27:24,852
- Never Dead Queen.
- Yes.

523
00:27:24,935 --> 00:27:28,397
SEO OK: PASS

524
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:29,982
It's yes from me.

525
00:27:30,858 --> 00:27:31,859
NEVER DEAD QUEEN PASSES
It's a yes from me.

526
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:32,985
Thank you!

527
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,281
- I actually felt something opposite.
- I see.

528
00:27:37,364 --> 00:27:39,032
I felt heartbroken.

529
00:27:39,116 --> 00:27:42,369
These painful scars looked so real

530
00:27:42,452 --> 00:27:45,122
that I wondered

531
00:27:45,205 --> 00:27:48,083
if you'd experienced these scars yourself.

532
00:27:48,417 --> 00:27:52,171
You've also demonstrated

533
00:27:52,254 --> 00:27:54,256
<i>a great understanding</i>

534
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,384
<i>of the many elements</i>
<i>involved in creating different scars.</i>

535
00:27:57,759 --> 00:28:00,554
<i>And I could also see</i>

536
00:28:00,637 --> 00:28:02,681
<i>that you had a definite plan in mind</i>

537
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:05,976
with meticulous details

538
00:28:06,059 --> 00:28:10,063
for coloring and tearing things
to achieve the look.

539
00:28:10,689 --> 00:28:12,774
- So it's a yes from me.
- Thank you!

540
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,193
Congratulations.

541
00:28:14,276 --> 00:28:15,444
NEVER DEAD QUEEN

542
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:16,737
Thank you!

543
00:28:16,820 --> 00:28:17,821
I want to see it!

544
00:28:17,905 --> 00:28:18,822
My gosh! I'm so happy!

545
00:28:18,906 --> 00:28:20,699
Never Dead Queen has passed.

546
00:28:20,782 --> 00:28:22,618
- Congratulations.
- She never dies.

547
00:28:25,037 --> 00:28:27,122
My heart is about to burst!

548
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:33,712
My, my. Great work.

549
00:28:33,795 --> 00:28:35,047
You were amazing.

550
00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:40,219
<i>I was just over the moon.</i>

551
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,054
<i>I'm Never Dead Queen.</i>

552
00:28:42,137 --> 00:28:44,640
<i>So I won't settle until I become the best.</i>

553
00:28:45,474 --> 00:28:46,850
How incredible.

554
00:28:49,186 --> 00:28:50,646
What do you think will happen
to the drag queens?

555
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,397
- I'm so curious about their works.
- Me too.

556
00:28:52,481 --> 00:28:53,899
It'd be fun to see them compete

557
00:28:53,982 --> 00:28:55,609
after getting through Round One.

558
00:28:55,817 --> 00:28:58,737
- They're like rivals.
- Yes, those two.

559
00:28:59,071 --> 00:29:02,324
Hello, I'm Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon,

560
00:29:02,407 --> 00:29:03,742
who sparkles on stage in Itaewon.

561
00:29:03,825 --> 00:29:05,035
The queen is here.

562
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:07,287
Hello, I'm Queen-Fluencer!

563
00:29:07,496 --> 00:29:09,998
<i>I'm a drag artist.</i>

564
00:29:10,165 --> 00:29:12,834
I've known Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon
for so long.

565
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,837
<i>She's my senior colleague,</i>
<i>who's gone through thick and thin with me</i>

566
00:29:15,921 --> 00:29:18,340
<i>since my rookie days as a drag artist.</i>

567
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,760
<i>We're best friends</i>
<i>who have been through it all.</i>

568
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:23,595
Yes.

569
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:25,138
You're going for your respective styles?

570
00:29:25,222 --> 00:29:26,306
- Yes.
- Totally.

571
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:28,600
You two look very similar.

572
00:29:28,684 --> 00:29:29,685
- Yes, a bit.
- Is it different?

573
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:31,603
- We're rivals today.
- Yes.

574
00:29:32,271 --> 00:29:34,314
You and I are rivals.

575
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:36,525
- It's competition time.
- That's right.

576
00:29:36,650 --> 00:29:37,943
I won't go easy on you.

577
00:29:42,030 --> 00:29:43,448
<i>I need to stay on the show for longer.</i>

578
00:29:44,199 --> 00:29:46,451
I'm more senior in the industry,
after all.

579
00:29:46,827 --> 00:29:49,871
We're not here as GVAN and Bori today.

580
00:29:49,955 --> 00:29:51,999
This is a competition, right?

581
00:29:53,667 --> 00:29:57,963
Do you often prepare drag queen makeup
on other people?

582
00:29:58,422 --> 00:29:59,506
No, it's my first time.

583
00:29:59,589 --> 00:30:00,799
- First time?
- Yes.

584
00:30:01,675 --> 00:30:03,427
THE QUEEN'S DRAG QUEEN MAKEUP
I'll look forward to it.

585
00:30:03,510 --> 00:30:04,970
I'll do my best.

586
00:30:05,053 --> 00:30:06,888
What? It'll be so impressive
if they nail it.

587
00:30:08,265 --> 00:30:10,183
- GVAN is good.
- Yes.

588
00:30:10,559 --> 00:30:12,144
QUEEN-FLUENCER'S DRAG QUEEN MAKEUP
Wait. That's actually really good.

589
00:30:12,227 --> 00:30:13,520
I know. GVAN is thriving.

590
00:30:13,603 --> 00:30:14,688
GVAN's good with makeup.

591
00:30:14,771 --> 00:30:17,816
Yes, GVAN's makeup already looks so good.

592
00:30:17,899 --> 00:30:18,984
I can tell they have skills.

593
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:21,320
- I bet it'll be great.
- Yes.

594
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,658
<i>My biggest focus today</i>
<i>is on the eye makeup.</i>

595
00:30:27,576 --> 00:30:29,870
<i>I wanted her to look flamboyant,</i>

596
00:30:29,953 --> 00:30:33,415
<i>so I prepared gemstones</i>

597
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:36,126
<i>and put each piece on, one by one.</i>

598
00:30:38,795 --> 00:30:41,173
Please look at the gemstones on her eyes.

599
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:43,467
- Let me see.
- They're so sparkly.

600
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:46,720
Wow. She suddenly looks so flashy.

601
00:30:47,971 --> 00:30:50,682
How many of those
giant lash pieces is there?

602
00:30:50,766 --> 00:30:52,768
Where did she buy those?

603
00:30:55,812 --> 00:30:57,272
Open your eyes.

604
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:02,903
I want to learn how to do that.

605
00:31:02,986 --> 00:31:05,030
- Sure!
- I really want to learn.

606
00:31:05,655 --> 00:31:06,907
- Call me.
- Okay.

607
00:31:06,990 --> 00:31:08,283
I mean it.

608
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,118
I got a compliment.

609
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,954
From a boutique director, too.

610
00:31:13,288 --> 00:31:15,457
Does this mean I'll advance to Round Two?

611
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:17,709
- Things are looking good.
- It looks good.

612
00:31:17,793 --> 00:31:18,752
- She'll make it.
- She's doing well.

613
00:31:18,835 --> 00:31:20,837
I bet one of them will advance
to Round Two.

614
00:31:21,671 --> 00:31:23,590
This is so hard.

615
00:31:25,133 --> 00:31:26,635
It's driving me nuts.

616
00:31:27,969 --> 00:31:31,306
She still has a long way to go.

617
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,935
<i>I paid the most attention to the eyeliner.</i>

618
00:31:35,018 --> 00:31:37,646
<i>I put the most effort</i>
<i>into making the ends of the eyes</i>

619
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,106
<i>look sharp and clean.</i>

620
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:42,859
<i>I spent about 30 minutes just on that.</i>

621
00:31:48,949 --> 00:31:50,992
<i>She was working on the eyeliner</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

622
00:31:51,076 --> 00:31:53,995
<i>I kept checking the timer out of anxiety.</i>

623
00:31:54,996 --> 00:31:57,374
<i>I couldn't even ask questions,</i>

624
00:31:57,457 --> 00:31:58,792
<i>even when I had some.</i>

625
00:32:01,670 --> 00:32:04,756
<i>I didn't have enough time,</i>
<i>so my confidence was nonexistent.</i>

626
00:32:05,507 --> 00:32:06,716
I can do it.

627
00:32:07,843 --> 00:32:09,052
I can do it.

628
00:32:10,137 --> 00:32:11,680
I must get through it.

629
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,559
Will she make it on time?

630
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:19,146
Ten minutes remaining.

631
00:32:21,857 --> 00:32:24,860
Let me try to finish the eyes, at least.

632
00:32:25,068 --> 00:32:27,279
They should give us more time.

633
00:32:28,155 --> 00:32:30,031
I just need to color your lips,
and we should be done.

634
00:32:30,699 --> 00:32:32,492
She's much better than I expected.

635
00:32:32,576 --> 00:32:33,785
- Very good, right?
- Yes.

636
00:32:33,869 --> 00:32:35,036
You'll be blown away
when you see it from the front.

637
00:32:35,328 --> 00:32:37,581
Five minutes remaining.

638
00:32:40,208 --> 00:32:42,711
You have to finish the lips.

639
00:32:44,004 --> 00:32:45,505
- Oh, no.
- You only have two minutes.

640
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,382
Just work on the lips first.

641
00:32:48,675 --> 00:32:50,218
I'm done.

642
00:32:50,760 --> 00:32:53,763
Five, four, three,

643
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:56,099
two, one.

644
00:32:56,433 --> 00:32:59,644
Please put your brushes down
and finish the makeup.

645
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:02,063
What do I do?

646
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,318
This is bad.

647
00:33:06,943 --> 00:33:08,737
GVAN, you did so well!

648
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,906
I can only see it from the side,
but it looks so good.

649
00:33:11,031 --> 00:33:11,948
So sparkly.

650
00:33:12,032 --> 00:33:13,658
I think GVAN will pass while Bori won't.

651
00:33:13,742 --> 00:33:16,077
- What?
- I think GVAN will pass while Bori won't.

652
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,163
- Queen-Fluencer.
- Yes.

653
00:33:18,246 --> 00:33:20,999
It's like your twin is here.

654
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:24,336
Yes, I've prepared my signature makeup
and created my twin.

655
00:33:24,419 --> 00:33:26,546
<i>I wanted to incorporate brighter colors</i>

656
00:33:26,630 --> 00:33:29,132
<i>than the ones on my face today.</i>

657
00:33:29,216 --> 00:33:31,259
<i>I went for cyberpunk-like lips</i>

658
00:33:31,343 --> 00:33:33,678
<i>and added little gems</i>

659
00:33:33,762 --> 00:33:35,430
<i>to add a pop element</i>

660
00:33:35,514 --> 00:33:38,266
<i>to a regular drag queen look.</i>

661
00:33:46,441 --> 00:33:49,778
<i>I told myself to be confident,</i>
<i>as this was my daily makeup.</i>

662
00:33:52,155 --> 00:33:53,740
Please pass.

663
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:56,284
Queen-Fluencer, get to the next round.

664
00:33:56,785 --> 00:33:58,745
Queen-Fluencer,

665
00:34:01,665 --> 00:34:02,958
- it's a no from me.
- Okay.

666
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,376
It's a no from me.

667
00:34:04,459 --> 00:34:05,502
Okay.

668
00:34:05,585 --> 00:34:09,839
It might've been different if this were
a competition among drag queens.

669
00:34:09,923 --> 00:34:11,841
But this is

670
00:34:12,050 --> 00:34:16,513
a survival show with
makeup artists from all fields.

671
00:34:16,596 --> 00:34:17,889
I felt

672
00:34:18,473 --> 00:34:21,810
like the white eyeliner
didn't seem white enough.

673
00:34:22,060 --> 00:34:25,605
<i>The black wings weren't filled</i>
<i>meticulously enough,</i>

674
00:34:25,689 --> 00:34:27,482
<i>nor did they look clean.</i>

675
00:34:27,941 --> 00:34:29,859
<i>Those little details that you missed</i>

676
00:34:29,943 --> 00:34:34,030
made me doubt your basic skills.

677
00:34:34,114 --> 00:34:35,031
I understand.

678
00:34:35,448 --> 00:34:37,909
Queen-Fluencer,

679
00:34:43,498 --> 00:34:45,834
it's also a no from me.

680
00:34:46,167 --> 00:34:48,336
QUEEN-FLUENCER IS OUT

681
00:34:48,420 --> 00:34:51,256
From a distance,

682
00:34:51,339 --> 00:34:54,926
I thought you set the very example
of a classic drag queen look.

683
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:58,096
But when I saw the model's face closely,

684
00:34:58,179 --> 00:35:00,682
<i>I noticed</i>
<i>a lack of contouring and highlighting</i>

685
00:35:00,765 --> 00:35:04,644
<i>that should've been more dramatic</i>
<i>to match the eye makeup.</i>

686
00:35:04,728 --> 00:35:07,939
<i>That was a bit disappointing.</i>

687
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,984
- Ultimately, you've been eliminated.
- Okay.

688
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:13,069
- Okay.
- Thank you.

689
00:35:13,153 --> 00:35:14,988
- Good work.
- Nice try.

690
00:35:15,905 --> 00:35:17,198
GVAN's out.

691
00:35:17,282 --> 00:35:18,783
GVAN is out.

692
00:35:20,368 --> 00:35:22,746
Off I go, then. See you on stage.

693
00:35:27,542 --> 00:35:28,376
Oh, my goodness.

694
00:35:28,668 --> 00:35:30,420
- GVAN got eliminated?
- Yes.

695
00:35:30,503 --> 00:35:32,297
You're so cool!

696
00:35:32,380 --> 00:35:34,466
- Stay confident!
- Bye!

697
00:35:37,677 --> 00:35:39,679
- But she did so well.
- Goodbye, then.

698
00:35:41,181 --> 00:35:42,849
Oh, my. Mirror.

699
00:35:43,433 --> 00:35:44,684
Who's the fairest of them all?

700
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,020
It's me.

701
00:35:47,270 --> 00:35:48,938
Today's makeup was disappointing.

702
00:35:49,022 --> 00:35:51,650
But it's okay
since I always shine on stage.

703
00:35:53,109 --> 00:35:54,152
I'm out!

704
00:35:56,655 --> 00:36:00,533
- Look at her eyes over there.
- I know.

705
00:36:00,950 --> 00:36:02,577
She looks so nervous.

706
00:36:03,203 --> 00:36:06,081
<i>I thought Queen-Fluencer's look was</i>

707
00:36:06,164 --> 00:36:08,667
<i>perfectly polished.</i>

708
00:36:08,917 --> 00:36:12,087
<i>I was sure I'd get eliminated as well.</i>

709
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:14,381
<i>I realized that I stood no chance.</i>

710
00:36:17,759 --> 00:36:19,010
- Hello.
- Hello.

711
00:36:19,094 --> 00:36:20,762
- Hello.
- Please explain the look.

712
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:23,640
Today's look is

713
00:36:23,723 --> 00:36:26,726
my own drag queen makeup.

714
00:36:26,810 --> 00:36:30,230
SECOND-FLOOR QUEEN OF ITAEWON'S
DRAG QUEEN MAKEUP

715
00:36:30,313 --> 00:36:34,401
<i>I prepared</i>
<i>a seductive and sexy diva makeup.</i>

716
00:36:34,484 --> 00:36:36,361
<i>This is my signature look.</i>

717
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:54,546
<i>I just relaxed and assumed</i>

718
00:36:54,754 --> 00:36:56,005
<i>I'd get eliminated.</i>

719
00:36:58,550 --> 00:37:00,260
Did you copy and paste your look
onto her face?

720
00:37:00,343 --> 00:37:01,761
I guess so.

721
00:37:02,429 --> 00:37:03,888
- They look identical.
- Yes.

722
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:07,976
- It's very detail-oriented.
- In the process.

723
00:37:08,101 --> 00:37:10,145
She said she'd never put makeup
on someone else.

724
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,813
I was astounded by the attentiveness.

725
00:37:12,647 --> 00:37:14,607
- We'll now announce the result.
- Okay.

726
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,443
It's...

727
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:22,615
It's a yes from me.

728
00:37:22,699 --> 00:37:25,368
SEO OK: PASS

729
00:37:26,035 --> 00:37:27,036
What?

730
00:37:27,287 --> 00:37:29,622
Those who mostly put makeup
on their own faces

731
00:37:29,706 --> 00:37:31,541
find it difficult to analyze
other facial structures

732
00:37:31,624 --> 00:37:33,084
or achieve symmetry

733
00:37:33,168 --> 00:37:35,003
when putting makeup on others.

734
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,714
<i>But you did a very good job at that.</i>

735
00:37:37,797 --> 00:37:39,924
<i>The overall look is</i>

736
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,760
<i>also deserving of a pass.</i>

737
00:37:41,843 --> 00:37:43,136
Thank you.

738
00:37:44,512 --> 00:37:46,973
<i>Did I do well? Did I?</i>

739
00:37:47,348 --> 00:37:49,350
Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon.

740
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:50,518
Yes.

741
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:53,688
- It's a yes from me.
- What?

742
00:37:53,980 --> 00:37:54,814
It's a yes from me.

743
00:37:54,898 --> 00:37:55,940
What?

744
00:38:01,029 --> 00:38:02,405
What? Did Bori pass?

745
00:38:02,489 --> 00:38:05,658
- What a surprise!
- I didn't see that coming!

746
00:38:05,742 --> 00:38:08,286
- Remember how I asked you
- Yes?

747
00:38:08,369 --> 00:38:10,622
if you'd ever put makeup on someone else?

748
00:38:10,914 --> 00:38:13,958
- And you said you'd never done it.
- Yes.

749
00:38:14,042 --> 00:38:15,877
And despite that,
your look is very polished,

750
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,212
so it's a yes from me.

751
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:18,755
Thank you so much.

752
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:20,882
- I'll see how you do
- Yes.

753
00:38:20,965 --> 00:38:23,426
- in the next round.
- Yes, for sure.

754
00:38:23,510 --> 00:38:24,803
- Thank you.
- All right.

755
00:38:27,347 --> 00:38:28,223
Oh, my!

756
00:38:30,391 --> 00:38:33,102
Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon has passed.

757
00:38:34,229 --> 00:38:35,188
Congratulations.

758
00:38:36,898 --> 00:38:38,358
Thank you!

759
00:38:41,236 --> 00:38:43,238
- How talented.
- Yes.

760
00:38:43,404 --> 00:38:45,532
Putting makeup on someone else
is a completely different task.

761
00:38:46,366 --> 00:38:48,701
<i>I got many degrading looks and comments</i>

762
00:38:48,785 --> 00:38:52,789
<i>with this kind of makeup on</i>
<i>in my time as a drag queen.</i>

763
00:38:52,872 --> 00:38:56,668
<i>Many have told me</i>
<i>I didn't even look like a drag queen.</i>

764
00:38:57,252 --> 00:38:59,087
That's insane.

765
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,672
How can this be?

766
00:39:00,755 --> 00:39:02,924
<i>It felt so satisfying</i>

767
00:39:03,174 --> 00:39:05,218
to receive their approval.

768
00:39:05,969 --> 00:39:08,096
<i>I'm worthy of their approval.</i>

769
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:10,139
Are you a shaman performing a ritual?

770
00:39:11,766 --> 00:39:14,936
ROUND 1
JUST MAKEUP JUDGING IS OVER

771
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:18,064
Currently, 18 people have passed.

772
00:39:18,147 --> 00:39:20,066
There are 12 more open spots.

773
00:39:20,567 --> 00:39:24,279
Now, let's begin the assessment
of those on hold.

774
00:39:24,445 --> 00:39:27,407
ON-HOLD CONTESTANT JUDGING BEGINS
Are we being judged by the same judges?

775
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,410
All four judges must be judging together.

776
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:31,369
I'm getting chills.

777
00:39:31,452 --> 00:39:33,121
ALL FOUR JUDGES WILL JUDGE
THE ON-HOLD CONTESTANTS TOGETHER

778
00:39:33,288 --> 00:39:36,749
If you could do one more thing,
what would you do?

779
00:39:37,792 --> 00:39:39,294
They're re-evaluating the looks.

780
00:39:40,795 --> 00:39:44,424
They'll determine who passes
after looking at everyone's work.

781
00:39:47,176 --> 00:39:49,804
Passing from being on hold must be hard.
They must satisfy all four.

782
00:39:52,682 --> 00:39:54,183
I have nowhere to back down.

783
00:39:54,684 --> 00:39:55,852
- Okay.
- Yes.

784
00:39:55,935 --> 00:39:57,854
RE-ASSESSMENT
FOR ON-HOLD CONTESTANTS IS OVER

785
00:39:58,187 --> 00:40:01,274
We will now announce
the additional artists for Round Two.

786
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:04,193
There are currently 18 people on hold.

787
00:40:04,611 --> 00:40:06,654
And the number of additional passes

788
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:08,323
will be 12.

789
00:40:09,073 --> 00:40:10,408

Congratulations.

801
00:40:31,471 --> 00:40:32,847
Ye-seul Arts Center.

802
00:40:36,100 --> 00:40:37,518
You're already crying!

803
00:40:37,852 --> 00:40:39,270
What's with me?

804
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,522
People will think
I won the show or something.

805
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,778
The last additional contestant
for Round Two is

806
00:40:47,695 --> 00:40:50,323

807
00:40:51,199 --> 00:40:52,408

808
00:40:52,492 --> 00:40:53,493
Congratulations!

809
00:41:02,669 --> 00:41:06,089
All 30 seats for Round 2 have been filled.

810
00:41:06,756 --> 00:41:12,762
THE FINAL 30 FOR ROUND 2

811
00:41:29,028 --> 00:41:29,904
No way.

812
00:41:33,616 --> 00:41:35,410
- That's incredible!
- What?

813
00:41:35,910 --> 00:41:37,578
I can't believe I get to sit here.

814
00:41:39,914 --> 00:41:41,290
This is so cool.

815
00:41:41,833 --> 00:41:44,335
Hyo-ri is as beautiful as always.

816
00:41:44,419 --> 00:41:45,378
The queen.

817
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:47,338
You're beautiful!

818
00:41:47,422 --> 00:41:48,464
Thank you.

819
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:52,593
- It feels like a dream.
- I know, right?

820
00:41:52,677 --> 00:41:54,387
My goodness!

821
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,181
I wonder what the next mission will be.

822
00:41:57,265 --> 00:41:59,100
It looks like a group round.

823
00:41:59,976 --> 00:42:02,520
Welcome to Round Two, everyone.

824
00:42:06,649 --> 00:42:09,694
Your time to celebrate is over.

825
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:13,031
You must move right on to the next round.

826
00:42:13,114 --> 00:42:16,909
I'm sure none of you know
what to expect in Round Two.

827
00:42:16,993 --> 00:42:19,787
Do we have to prepare a look
in ten minutes?

828
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:21,998
You know what? Let me add that.

829
00:42:22,081 --> 00:42:25,418
- What?
- We'll call it "Just Ten Minute Makeup."

830
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:28,087
We'll get that ready, too.

831
00:42:28,171 --> 00:42:31,549
I will now announce the Round Two mission,
which will begin now.

832
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:32,967
It's...

833
00:42:33,468 --> 00:42:34,385
<i>What is it?</i>

834
00:42:37,096 --> 00:42:38,306
<i>What could it possibly be?</i>

835
00:42:39,057 --> 00:42:41,059
It's the 1-on-1 Death Match Mirror Round,

836
00:42:41,142 --> 00:42:44,854
where only one of you will survive.

837
00:42:45,271 --> 00:42:46,189
My gosh.

838
00:42:46,272 --> 00:42:47,273
A mirror round.

839
00:42:47,356 --> 00:42:48,524
- My goodness.
- What?

840
00:42:49,358 --> 00:42:52,195
<i>A death match right away?</i>

841
00:42:52,487 --> 00:42:54,030
<i>Another half will be eliminated.</i>

842
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,324
<i>What can we do? It's a survival show.</i>

843
00:42:57,867 --> 00:43:00,495
It's indeed a survival show.

844
00:43:01,704 --> 00:43:04,248
<i>I understand what a death match is,</i>
<i>but what's a mirror round?</i>

845
00:43:04,457 --> 00:43:07,752
We will now reveal the 15 keywords

846
00:43:07,835 --> 00:43:09,295
for this round.

847
00:43:12,006 --> 00:43:15,676
Oh, my gosh!

848
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:19,680
Oh, wow. Drag is one of the keywords!

849
00:43:19,764 --> 00:43:21,432
Oh, you're right.

850
00:43:21,516 --> 00:43:23,184
- Natural?
- Barbie.

851
00:43:23,476 --> 00:43:26,104
K-pop, Rock Chic.

852
00:43:26,187 --> 00:43:28,272
Bohemian also sounds hard.

853
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:29,565
Pop of Color.

854
00:43:30,024 --> 00:43:31,192
Red Horse?

855
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:32,693
What does Red Horse mean?

856
00:43:32,777 --> 00:43:34,904
I know. What does it mean?

857
00:43:35,238 --> 00:43:39,617
You will get 15 different themes
for the 1-on-1 Death Match of Round 2.

858
00:43:39,700 --> 00:43:41,911
<i>I'll be choosing a random brush,</i>

859
00:43:41,994 --> 00:43:43,996
<i>and the chosen brush's owner</i>

860
00:43:44,080 --> 00:43:45,790
<i>will pick the theme first.</i>

861
00:43:45,873 --> 00:43:48,543
<i>Then, an artist may volunteer</i>

862
00:43:48,626 --> 00:43:51,003
<i>to take on that artist or that theme.</i>

863
00:43:51,838 --> 00:43:53,673
Do I choose the theme or the opponent?

864
00:43:53,756 --> 00:43:56,509
The genders under the keywords
indicate the model's gender.

865
00:43:57,218 --> 00:44:00,304
- Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon.
- Yes?

866
00:44:00,721 --> 00:44:02,723
Which keyword stands out to you?

867
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,392
Well...

868
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,643
Something you know is yours.

869
00:44:07,895 --> 00:44:08,938
The drag...

870
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:12,817
I thought you'd pick one immediately,
but you're taking a while.

871
00:44:13,234 --> 00:44:15,319
How can we beat a drag queen
at drag queen makeup?

872
00:44:15,403 --> 00:44:16,320
I know.

873
00:44:16,404 --> 00:44:17,488
Detailed Hands,

874
00:44:17,572 --> 00:44:19,115
you're reading the keywords
very carefully.

875
00:44:19,198 --> 00:44:20,783
I'm considering Natural...

876
00:44:20,867 --> 00:44:23,077
- Natural.
- as an option.

877
00:44:23,161 --> 00:44:24,620
- Natural.
- Of course.

878
00:44:24,745 --> 00:44:26,664
- I'm never choosing that.
- I can't go against Detailed Hands.

879
00:44:26,747 --> 00:44:28,958
Each of you seems to have

880
00:44:29,041 --> 00:44:31,169
a keyword on your mind.

881
00:44:31,252 --> 00:44:34,797
Let's now begin the keyword matching
for Round Two.

882
00:44:35,047 --> 00:44:38,217
A lot depends on my hands today.

883
00:44:38,634 --> 00:44:41,679
Who will be the first one chosen?

884
00:44:48,102 --> 00:44:49,770
BeauTube Veteran.

885
00:44:50,313 --> 00:44:52,023
BeauTube Veteran.

886
00:44:53,441 --> 00:44:54,275
What do I do?

887
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:55,902
BEAUTUBE VETERAN

888
00:44:55,985 --> 00:44:57,236
I'm scared!

889
00:44:57,361 --> 00:44:59,322
You used so many colors.

890
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,032
<i>Yes, it's a colorful look.</i>

891
00:45:01,115 --> 00:45:02,491
A veteran is indeed a veteran.

892
00:45:02,575 --> 00:45:04,452
- It's a yes from me. Congratulations.
- Thank you.

893
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:06,120
SSIN hasn't lost her touch at all.

894
00:45:06,287 --> 00:45:07,622
- She's on another level, right?
- Yes.

895
00:45:08,414 --> 00:45:10,791
You were the first one picked.

896
00:45:11,334 --> 00:45:15,004
Please choose the keyword
you're most confident about.

897
00:45:18,966 --> 00:45:20,259
She's still thinking.

898
00:45:22,678 --> 00:45:24,055
ROCK CHIC, DRAG, 90S TEEN, K-POP,
FUSION ORIENTALISM, GLAM GRUNGE, FUTURISM

899
00:45:24,138 --> 00:45:25,389
BARBIE, RED HORSE, POP OF COLOR, BOHEMIAN,
GLITTER PARTY, SPORTS SHOOT...

900
00:45:26,015 --> 00:45:28,142
I can't wait to see what she chooses.

901
00:45:29,143 --> 00:45:29,977
I'll choose

902
00:45:30,561 --> 00:45:31,520
Drag.

903
00:45:31,604 --> 00:45:32,813
- Drag?
- Yes.

904
00:45:33,314 --> 00:45:34,273
I'll choose Drag.

905
00:45:34,357 --> 00:45:35,441
Drag?

906
00:45:37,652 --> 00:45:38,819
I can't wait.

907
00:45:39,904 --> 00:45:42,823
BeauTube Veteran has chosen Drag.

908
00:45:42,907 --> 00:45:43,824
DRAG: MALE

909
00:45:43,908 --> 00:45:45,243
It suits her.

910
00:45:45,326 --> 00:45:48,037
Now, if you'd like to
go against BeauTube Veteran

911
00:45:48,120 --> 00:45:49,080
on the Drag look,

912
00:45:49,372 --> 00:45:52,041
please step forward right now.

913
00:45:52,917 --> 00:45:54,627
I'm no good with drag queen makeup.

914
00:45:55,169 --> 00:45:57,588
- Are you going?
- No, I don't stand a chance.

915
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:00,508
Nobody?

916
00:46:01,467 --> 00:46:02,510
All right.

917
00:46:04,387 --> 00:46:05,304
All right.

918
00:46:11,018 --> 00:46:12,019
All right.

919
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:17,358
MACtist.

920
00:46:17,984 --> 00:46:19,485
He was very famous at MAC.

921
00:46:19,568 --> 00:46:20,653
- Really?
- Yes.

922
00:46:20,736 --> 00:46:22,863
MACtist even became
a national artist at MAC.

923
00:46:23,239 --> 00:46:24,782
"Whisper and splash."

924
00:46:24,865 --> 00:46:26,867
<i>The look leaves a strong impact.</i>

925
00:46:26,951 --> 00:46:28,911
<i>I could feel his creativity from it.</i>

926
00:46:30,371 --> 00:46:32,164
MACtist.

927
00:46:34,208 --> 00:46:36,127
I bet he'll nail it.

928
00:46:36,210 --> 00:46:37,586
MULTIPLE ARTISTS CAN COME UP TO CHALLENGE
Where are you, Bori?

929
00:46:37,670 --> 00:46:39,005
I'm sick of drag makeup now!

930
00:46:39,088 --> 00:46:40,881
I don't want to do more drag makeup!

931
00:46:41,424 --> 00:46:45,761
If nobody else is stepping forward,

932
00:46:46,304 --> 00:46:49,807
then it'll be a battle
between MACtist and BeauTube Veteran.

933
00:46:49,890 --> 00:46:52,184
That should be fun. What a thrill.

934
00:46:53,060 --> 00:46:55,354
MACtist, have you done any drag makeup?

935
00:46:55,438 --> 00:46:56,647
Yes, I have.

936
00:46:58,065 --> 00:46:59,317
I bet you have.

937
00:47:01,986 --> 00:47:04,280
- He always shares it on social media.
- Really?

938
00:47:06,907 --> 00:47:09,869
Switching up my look
between being a man or a woman

939
00:47:09,952 --> 00:47:11,829
is pretty easy for me.

940
00:47:11,912 --> 00:47:13,748
I also switch up my look between
being a man or a woman pretty often.

941
00:47:13,831 --> 00:47:16,917
Both of you are confident
in changing genders through makeup.

942
00:47:17,168 --> 00:47:19,003
It's a battle between two masters.

943
00:47:19,086 --> 00:47:20,796
Both are such strong opponents.

944
00:47:21,672 --> 00:47:23,174
<i>Between MACtist and me?</i>

945
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,258
<i>I'll win.</i>

946
00:47:25,343 --> 00:47:27,511
<i>It's a survival show. I can't go home yet.</i>

947
00:47:27,595 --> 00:47:28,763
<i>I'm going to win the 300 million won.</i>

948
00:47:29,764 --> 00:47:30,639
DRAG: MALE

949
00:47:30,723 --> 00:47:32,141
Drag makeup should be fun.

950
00:47:32,224 --> 00:47:33,267
I think it'll be fun.

951
00:47:34,435 --> 00:47:36,145
Jenny the Veteran.

952
00:47:36,437 --> 00:47:38,064
- Jenny the Veteran.
- Yes.

953
00:47:38,147 --> 00:47:39,857
Please choose the keyword you want.

954
00:47:39,940 --> 00:47:40,983
I'll choose

955
00:47:41,067 --> 00:47:42,151
- Glitter Party.
- Oh, my.

956
00:47:42,234 --> 00:47:43,569
- Glitter Party.
- Go, it's you.

957
00:47:45,946 --> 00:47:46,864
I mean...

958
00:47:46,947 --> 00:47:48,199
- I'll choose Glitter Party.
- Oh, my.

959
00:47:48,282 --> 00:47:49,492
- Glitter party.
- Go, it's you.

960
00:47:50,242 --> 00:47:51,327
Oh, wow. Go.

961
00:47:51,786 --> 00:47:54,413
I mean, she's a walking ball of glitter.

962
00:47:54,497 --> 00:47:55,331
What?

963
00:47:57,124 --> 00:47:58,793
Two more are coming out.

964
00:47:59,627 --> 00:48:01,212
MS. KIM FROM THE MAKEUP ROOM
Gosh, Glitter Party.

965
00:48:01,295 --> 00:48:02,838
BEAUTY HEIRESS

966
00:48:03,464 --> 00:48:05,049
Back off, you two.

967
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:06,926
- "Back off, you two."
- He's so funny.

968
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,055
I wanted to try something new.

969
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:13,891
I see. But if you wanted to try
something totally new,

970
00:48:13,974 --> 00:48:15,393
you should go for Natural.

971
00:48:16,977 --> 00:48:19,563
Wouldn't that be something really new?

972
00:48:20,856 --> 00:48:22,483
Please just choose me.

973
00:48:24,819 --> 00:48:26,654
FIRST ARTIST CHOOSES THEIR COMPETITION
Second-Floor Queen of Itaewon,

974
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:28,406
Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room,

975
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:29,824
and Beauty Heiress.

976
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:33,077
Which one will she choose?

977
00:48:33,160 --> 00:48:35,413
I'll choose Ms. Kim from the Makeup Room.

978
00:48:36,497 --> 00:48:38,332
MS. KIM VS. JENNY THE VETERAN

979
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,754
Golden Hand in Paris, please come forward.

980
00:48:43,921 --> 00:48:45,923
I really don't want to go against her.

981
00:48:46,006 --> 00:48:48,217
- I'll choose...
- Really?

982
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:49,385
What?

983
00:48:49,468 --> 00:48:51,345
- What?
- That's crazy!

984
00:48:51,595 --> 00:48:53,222
Never Dead Queen.

985
00:48:55,224 --> 00:48:56,642
I wonder what she'll choose!

986
00:48:56,767 --> 00:48:57,935
I'll choose Futurism.

987
00:48:58,018 --> 00:48:59,270
- Futurism!
- Yes.

988
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,272
I doubt anyone will choose Futurism.

989
00:49:01,355 --> 00:49:03,774
Everyone is looking away.

990
00:49:03,858 --> 00:49:07,570
Are you all scared of the theme
or Never Dead Queen?

991
00:49:07,653 --> 00:49:08,863
Please come!

992
00:49:09,363 --> 00:49:10,322
I'm alone.

993
00:49:10,406 --> 00:49:11,782
IF THE KEYWORD MATCH UP FAILS,
THE CHOSEN ARTIST WILL HAVE TO WAIT

994
00:49:11,866 --> 00:49:13,617
I can go with any theme but that.

995
00:49:13,701 --> 00:49:15,286
There's no way I can end up with Futurism.

996
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,788
First Man, please come forward.

997
00:49:17,955 --> 00:49:20,249
I'll choose Glam Grunge.

998
00:49:20,332 --> 00:49:22,710
First Man for Glam Grunge.

999
00:49:26,046 --> 00:49:28,591
<i>It's an older, senior male artist</i>

1000
00:49:28,674 --> 00:49:31,218
<i>against a young, rookie male artist.</i>

1001
00:49:31,427 --> 00:49:32,636
That should be fun.

1002
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:33,721
FIRST MAN VS. SEONGSU-DONG PRINCE

1003
00:49:33,804 --> 00:49:34,930
What an interesting pair.

1004
00:49:35,222 --> 00:49:39,560
Everyone has been matched
for the 1-on-1 Death Match of Round 2.

1005
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,153
This is how it's set up! That's so cool!

1006
00:49:50,446 --> 00:49:52,114
It's totally different this time.

1007
00:49:52,615 --> 00:49:53,449
No way!

1008
00:49:55,075 --> 00:49:57,661
This is unbelievable.

1009
00:49:57,745 --> 00:49:59,580
So we're facing each other.

1010
00:49:59,788 --> 00:50:01,248
- The artists face each other.
- What?

1011
00:50:01,332 --> 00:50:03,292
We're facing each other.

1012
00:50:03,417 --> 00:50:04,627
That's incredible.

1013
00:50:04,752 --> 00:50:06,420
I'm getting chills.

1014
00:50:06,587 --> 00:50:09,089
I see someone cool standing there.

1015
00:50:09,590 --> 00:50:12,801
For Hyo-ri,
even her silhouette is incredible.

1016
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:19,183
Welcome to the 1-on-1 Death Match
Mirror Round.

1017
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:22,478
She's so pretty.

1018
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:28,108
It's time
for what everyone's been waiting for.

1019
00:50:28,609 --> 00:50:29,818
I will now reveal

1020
00:50:30,694 --> 00:50:32,196
the models.

1021
00:50:32,279 --> 00:50:33,697
The models!

1022
00:50:33,781 --> 00:50:34,949
Why am I so nervous?

1023
00:50:36,909 --> 00:50:37,993
No way!

1024
00:50:40,120 --> 00:50:40,955
No way, are they...

1025
00:50:42,414 --> 00:50:43,249
No way, are they...

1026
00:50:46,001 --> 00:50:47,336
I'm getting goosebumps!

1027
00:50:47,670 --> 00:50:49,213
No way! They look identical!

1028
00:50:49,296 --> 00:50:50,923
They're twins!

1029
00:50:51,048 --> 00:50:52,383
- They're twins!
- No way!

1030
00:50:52,466 --> 00:50:54,635
- They're twins?
- Aren't they twin comedians?

1031
00:50:54,718 --> 00:50:56,387
They were on Gag Concert.

1032
00:50:56,470 --> 00:50:57,680
Those boys?

1033
00:50:58,430 --> 00:51:00,391
- They're even matching outfits.
- Yes.

1034
00:51:01,725 --> 00:51:02,935
- I can't believe it!
- Is this real?

1035
00:51:03,018 --> 00:51:04,144
They look identical!

1036
00:51:04,436 --> 00:51:05,604
- They look the same!
- You're right!

1037
00:51:05,688 --> 00:51:06,814
- No way!
- They're twins.

1038
00:51:06,897 --> 00:51:07,856
What?

1039
00:51:08,148 --> 00:51:09,817
- Unbelievable!
- This is crazy.

1040
00:51:09,900 --> 00:51:11,151
This is insane!

1041
00:51:11,235 --> 00:51:13,195
This must be the first time
anyone's done this in the world!

1042
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:15,239
<i>That's insane.</i>

1043
00:51:15,322 --> 00:51:17,950
<i>How did they find</i>
<i>15 pairs of twins in Korea?</i>

1044
00:51:18,033 --> 00:51:19,577
Yet they made it happen.

1045
00:51:19,660 --> 00:51:20,786
<i>How did they get them all?</i>

1046
00:51:20,869 --> 00:51:23,205
I've never seen so many twins in my life.

1047
00:51:23,289 --> 00:51:25,416
<i>How did they even find them?</i>

1048
00:51:25,499 --> 00:51:26,584
<i>This should be fun.</i>

1049
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,044
What a fair way to conduct this round.

1050
00:51:29,128 --> 00:51:30,713
<i>I thought, "What? They look the same!"</i>

1051
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,631
"That makes everything so fair!"

1052
00:51:32,756 --> 00:51:35,926
Do you understand
why this round is the "Mirror Round" now?

1053
00:51:38,012 --> 00:51:41,015
Your models for Round 2's
1-on-1 Death Match, Mirror Round,

1054
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:43,183
are none other than twins.

1055
00:51:46,353 --> 00:51:49,356
15 PAIRS OF MODEL TWINS
FOR THE 1-ON-1 DEATH MATCH MIRROR ROUND

1056
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,612
Now, let me tell you the most important
part of this match,

1057
00:51:54,695 --> 00:51:56,947
how you'll be judged.

1058
00:51:57,031 --> 00:52:01,493
The judges will only be considering
the final look for Round Two.

1059
00:52:01,702 --> 00:52:02,620
My gosh!

1060
00:52:02,703 --> 00:52:05,664
In other words, the judges won't know

1061
00:52:05,748 --> 00:52:07,166
who prepared which look.

1062
00:52:07,249 --> 00:52:08,500
Really?

1063
00:52:08,584 --> 00:52:10,252
The judges won't know who worked on whom.

1064
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:13,088
They'll only be looking at the final looks

1065
00:52:13,172 --> 00:52:15,924
to determine who fails and passes.

1066
00:52:16,216 --> 00:52:18,510
So it's a total blind test.

1067
00:52:18,594 --> 00:52:21,221
We couldn't watch the process at all.

1068
00:52:21,305 --> 00:52:24,683
So we'll only be focusing
on the makeup itself.

1069
00:52:24,767 --> 00:52:26,852
This seems to be the perfect mission

1070
00:52:26,935 --> 00:52:30,064
to go with the theme of JUST MAKEUP.

1071
00:52:30,731 --> 00:52:32,358
<i>I must impress the judges.</i>

1072
00:52:32,983 --> 00:52:35,736
<i>I got an adrenaline rush.</i>

1073
00:52:35,819 --> 00:52:37,905
<i>Beat me if you can.</i>

1074
00:52:38,197 --> 00:52:40,658
<i>You'll regret having chosen me.</i>

1075
00:52:41,241 --> 00:52:43,577
<i>I'm sorry, but I'll go up to Round Three.</i>

1076
00:52:43,661 --> 00:52:44,828
<i>I have nothing to lose.</i>

1077
00:52:44,912 --> 00:52:45,996
<i>My goal is to win.</i>

1078
00:52:46,080 --> 00:52:47,206
<i>It should be fun.</i>

1079
00:52:47,873 --> 00:52:49,583
The 1-on-1 Death Match Mirror Round

1080
00:52:49,667 --> 00:52:51,585
begins now.

1081
00:52:57,257 --> 00:52:59,134
- I'm so curious.
- Me too.

1082
00:52:59,218 --> 00:53:01,762
We can't observe
how they prepare the looks today.

1083
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,347
It's a total blind test.

1084
00:53:03,430 --> 00:53:04,556
I'm nervous.

1085
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:11,021
I guess we're facing each other.

1086
00:53:11,105 --> 00:53:12,439
- Really?
- The other side is also working.

1087
00:53:12,523 --> 00:53:13,649
- Yes, they seem to have begun.
- Yes.

1088
00:53:13,732 --> 00:53:15,109
I should visit the other side
to watch them.

1089
00:53:16,276 --> 00:53:17,945
I can feel the tension in the air.

1090
00:53:18,195 --> 00:53:19,905
It's so interesting to watch two artists

1091
00:53:19,988 --> 00:53:22,658
prepare different looks
with the same keyword.

1092
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:25,452
The theme plays quite an important part.

1093
00:53:25,536 --> 00:53:26,745
The judges need to see the story

1094
00:53:26,829 --> 00:53:28,872
- as soon as they look at the model.
- Yes.

1095
00:53:29,123 --> 00:53:31,667
Did you have a keyword
you really didn't want?

1096
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:32,960
Me?

1097
00:53:33,544 --> 00:53:35,254
- Red horse.
- Red horse.

1098
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:36,797
WHEN THEY WERE CHOOSING THE KEYWORDS

1099
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,507
What is Red Horse?

1100
00:53:38,590 --> 00:53:39,591
What does Red Horse mean?

1101
00:53:39,675 --> 00:53:40,926
What is Red Horse?

1102
00:53:41,009 --> 00:53:42,261
Red horse.

1103
00:53:42,386 --> 00:53:46,306
The year 2026
is the year of the red horse.

1104
00:53:46,515 --> 00:53:49,351
Please create a Red Horse look
using makeup.

1105
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:52,730
What was it? Red Horse?

1106
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,732
I was confused as soon as I saw it.

1107
00:53:54,815 --> 00:53:56,400
I was fine as long as
I didn't get Red Horse.

1108
00:53:56,483 --> 00:53:57,818
That was my mindset.

1109
00:53:58,610 --> 00:54:00,654
Golden Hand in Paris, please come forward.

1110
00:54:01,780 --> 00:54:04,491
Isn't Red Horse a good one?

1111
00:54:04,575 --> 00:54:05,576
I'll choose Red Horse.

1112
00:54:05,659 --> 00:54:06,744
- Really?
- Yes.

1113
00:54:06,827 --> 00:54:07,745
I'll choose Red Horse.

1114
00:54:07,828 --> 00:54:09,079
- Really?
- Yes.

1115
00:54:09,163 --> 00:54:10,080
What?

1116
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:11,915
Red Horse? My gosh!

1117
00:54:12,291 --> 00:54:14,585
- She came forward in seconds.
- Impressive.

1118
00:54:14,668 --> 00:54:15,794
I'll choose Red Horse.

1119
00:54:15,878 --> 00:54:17,004
- Really?
- Yes.

1120
00:54:18,505 --> 00:54:20,048
- She came forward in seconds.
- Yes.

1121
00:54:20,132 --> 00:54:21,216
GLITTER MAGICIAN

1122
00:54:21,675 --> 00:54:22,801
She's so brave.

1123
00:54:22,885 --> 00:54:24,595
They're both incredible.

1124
00:54:24,678 --> 00:54:25,596
GLITTER MAGICIAN VS. GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS

1125
00:54:26,472 --> 00:54:30,017
She's the makeup artist for Chung Ha.

1126
00:54:30,225 --> 00:54:32,770
Someone who I think will win first place?

1127
00:54:33,353 --> 00:54:35,939
Glitter Magician.

1128
00:54:36,023 --> 00:54:38,692
<i>She really creates magic with glitter.</i>

1129
00:54:38,776 --> 00:54:42,070
<i>She's already the hottest makeup artist</i>
<i>in the scene.</i>

1130
00:54:42,154 --> 00:54:44,698
Her makeup works are absolutely perfect.

1131
00:54:44,782 --> 00:54:47,826
<i>She seems to be a hard-working type</i>
<i>that analyzes and practices nonstop.</i>

1132
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:49,536
It's a yes from me.

1133
00:54:50,204 --> 00:54:51,580
Thank you.

1134
00:54:52,206 --> 00:54:54,750
That's real makeup.

1135
00:54:54,833 --> 00:54:56,126
<i>It was groundbreaking.</i>

1136
00:54:56,210 --> 00:54:58,212
<i>She indeed has golden hands.</i>

1137
00:54:59,046 --> 00:55:00,130
<i>My jaw dropped.</i>

1138
00:55:00,214 --> 00:55:02,925
I wanted to know
what she had going on in her head.

1139
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:04,551
Could I be like her?

1140
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:08,764
Her model is completely
surrounded by people right now.

1141
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:14,436
I hesitated,

1142
00:55:14,520 --> 00:55:17,564
but I had an inspiration
when I thought of Red Horse.

1143
00:55:17,648 --> 00:55:19,691
- Is there a look in your head?
- Yes.

1144
00:55:19,775 --> 00:55:21,151
You have a clear plan in your head?

1145
00:55:21,235 --> 00:55:22,903
Yes, there's a look I really want to do.

1146
00:55:23,237 --> 00:55:26,573
I also chose Red Horse
as I had something on my mind.

1147
00:55:27,407 --> 00:55:29,827
Both of you had inspiration
when you thought of Red Horse!

1148
00:55:29,910 --> 00:55:31,036
- I can't wait to see
- I'll look forward to the battle.

1149
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,913
- their final works.
- I'll also look forward to it.

1150
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,790
- I can't wait for their final looks.
- Same.

1151
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,959
They chose such a unique keyword.

1152
00:55:37,042 --> 00:55:38,377
Both of them are incredible.

1153
00:55:38,794 --> 00:55:40,212
- That'll be a fun battle to watch.
- Yeah.

1154
00:55:40,295 --> 00:55:41,922
- It's those two.
- Right.

1155
00:55:42,422 --> 00:55:44,675
- They're the Red Devil pair, right?
- Yes.

1156
00:55:44,758 --> 00:55:47,344
- Red Horse.
- Yes, Red Horse.

1157
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:51,932
How did they find models
that perfectly embody the Red Horse theme?

1158
00:55:52,015 --> 00:55:54,142
THE RED HORSE TWINS:
KIM SUNG-JUN AND KIM SUNG-HOON

1159
00:55:54,893 --> 00:55:56,395
That's my red horse.

1160
00:55:57,271 --> 00:55:59,398
I'll paint you red today.

1161
00:55:59,606 --> 00:56:01,650
The image that inspired me was

1162
00:56:01,733 --> 00:56:04,027
an image from the book, The Red Horse,

1163
00:56:04,111 --> 00:56:06,905
by Baek Seong-min.

1164
00:56:06,989 --> 00:56:07,990
This image.

1165
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:11,869
The red horse moving forward. It's bold.

1166
00:56:11,952 --> 00:56:13,912
It was perfect for the keyword.

1167
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:18,542
My motif was warriors
putting on body paint as a ritual

1168
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:19,918
before going to war.

1169
00:56:20,002 --> 00:56:22,379
I wanted to prepare a look for that.

1170
00:56:22,462 --> 00:56:23,630
A GENERAL ON A RED HORSE

1171
00:56:23,964 --> 00:56:25,883
What's your focus for the look?

1172
00:56:26,300 --> 00:56:28,385
It's a red horse, so I want it to be bold,

1173
00:56:28,468 --> 00:56:30,220
full of life, and strong.

1174
00:56:30,304 --> 00:56:31,847
- That's what a red horse is like.
- Yes.

1175
00:56:32,347 --> 00:56:35,475
And the battlefield is where horses can
exhibit those characteristics the best.

1176
00:56:35,559 --> 00:56:36,852
I wanted my horse to be in the lead,

1177
00:56:36,935 --> 00:56:38,729
running faster than everyone,

1178
00:56:38,812 --> 00:56:41,064
and battling his enemies with courage.

1179
00:56:41,148 --> 00:56:44,318
So, I wanted to create a look
for the God of Victory.

1180
00:56:44,610 --> 00:56:46,236
I can't wait for the Red Horse looks.

1181
00:56:46,320 --> 00:56:47,821
How will they create looks for Red Horse?

1182
00:56:49,990 --> 00:56:52,993
Could I put these contact lenses on you
before I begin the base makeup?

1183
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:53,952
Yes.

1184
00:56:54,453 --> 00:56:55,454
Please look up.

1185
00:56:55,996 --> 00:56:57,164
All good.

1186
00:56:57,581 --> 00:56:58,498
Face the front.

1187
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:02,753
Can you put it on by yourself?

1188
00:57:02,836 --> 00:57:03,754
I'll try it.

1189
00:57:03,837 --> 00:57:06,256
It's about 3mm bigger than a normal lens.

1190
00:57:06,340 --> 00:57:08,133
Both of them are using contact lenses.

1191
00:57:09,009 --> 00:57:11,178
To create horse-like eyes.

1192
00:57:11,678 --> 00:57:14,473
She's using huge contact lenses. My gosh!

1193
00:57:14,806 --> 00:57:17,684
She's applying some burgundy to him now.

1194
00:57:18,810 --> 00:57:20,729
<i>I was portraying a strong god,</i>

1195
00:57:20,812 --> 00:57:24,024
<i>so I added extra contouring where I could</i>

1196
00:57:24,107 --> 00:57:26,276
<i>with a red-toned product.</i>

1197
00:57:26,568 --> 00:57:28,779
<i>I also contoured his eyes</i>

1198
00:57:28,862 --> 00:57:31,114
<i>using red-toned eyeshadows.</i>

1199
00:57:31,198 --> 00:57:33,784
<i>To make him look powerful,</i>

1200
00:57:33,867 --> 00:57:36,828
<i>I extended his eyes using contouring</i>

1201
00:57:36,912 --> 00:57:39,039
<i>out to the temples of his head.</i>

1202
00:57:40,415 --> 00:57:41,333
It's so cool.

1203
00:57:42,876 --> 00:57:45,504
But it must be less interesting
than your other twin.

1204
00:57:45,587 --> 00:57:47,547
Fewer people are watching us.

1205
00:57:54,388 --> 00:57:56,306
I don't think I can beat her.

1206
00:57:57,182 --> 00:57:59,309
I saw the other model
with red all over his face.

1207
00:57:59,393 --> 00:58:01,228
But I don't want to do that.

1208
00:58:07,234 --> 00:58:09,444
She's on another level from the start.

1209
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:13,907
- It's a red horse.
- That's it.

1210
00:58:14,574 --> 00:58:15,909
Is this her look?

1211
00:58:15,993 --> 00:58:17,953
That's incredible.

1212
00:58:18,704 --> 00:58:19,746
That's so cool.

1213
00:58:20,330 --> 00:58:21,915
She's painting his face red
from the get-go.

1214
00:58:23,208 --> 00:58:25,252
Her brush strokes are so bold.

1215
00:58:25,377 --> 00:58:26,461
She's not hesitant at all.

1216
00:58:26,753 --> 00:58:28,255
I'd love to try that one day.

1217
00:58:29,089 --> 00:58:31,174
- With bold touches.
- Yes, bold touches.

1218
00:58:31,383 --> 00:58:32,634
So nonchalant and bold.

1219
00:58:33,385 --> 00:58:35,178
<i>I wanted to express</i>

1220
00:58:35,262 --> 00:58:39,141
<i>boldness, hope,</i>
<i>and the new year, 2026, in my look.</i>

1221
00:58:39,599 --> 00:58:42,060
Wait. What is this blender doing here?

1222
00:58:42,436 --> 00:58:44,771
- There's a blender.
- What is it doing here?

1223
00:58:44,896 --> 00:58:46,314
There's even a sieve.

1224
00:58:46,398 --> 00:58:47,858
I don't understand what they're for.

1225
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:50,068
Oh, my. What was that?

1226
00:58:53,655 --> 00:58:54,948
That scared me.

1227
00:58:56,616 --> 00:58:57,701
What is that?

1228
00:58:57,784 --> 00:59:00,120
She's a scientist. It's an experiment.

1229
00:59:00,662 --> 00:59:03,331
It's all powder.

1230
00:59:04,624 --> 00:59:06,626
<i>This is used for special effects makeup.</i>

1231
00:59:06,710 --> 00:59:08,420
<i>It's nylon,</i>

1232
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,506
which is a very fine fiber.

1233
00:59:11,590 --> 00:59:14,134
<i>You can bunch it up into balls,</i>

1234
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,886
<i>like fluff.</i>

1235
00:59:18,096 --> 00:59:19,473
She's using a sieve for it.

1236
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,100
It already looks very fine,
but she's sieving it.

1237
00:59:23,018 --> 00:59:26,313
Okay. I'll use some cotton balls
to block your nostrils.

1238
00:59:27,147 --> 00:59:28,190
Does she have to block his nose?

1239
00:59:29,149 --> 00:59:30,609
I can't tell what she's doing.

1240
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:33,195
I'm going to spray something
over your face,

1241
00:59:33,278 --> 00:59:34,571
and when I do that,

1242
00:59:34,654 --> 00:59:37,240
I need you to hold your breath
for about 15 seconds.

1243
00:59:37,324 --> 00:59:38,617
- Can you do that?
- I'll try.

1244
00:59:38,950 --> 00:59:40,952
Breathe in, and here we go.

1245
00:59:43,997 --> 00:59:46,374
- What is she spraying?
- A setting spray?

1246
00:59:46,833 --> 00:59:47,876
What is it?

1247
00:59:48,460 --> 00:59:49,961
Okay, wait.

1248
00:59:50,045 --> 00:59:51,171
Hold your chin up a bit more.

1249
00:59:51,254 --> 00:59:52,672
She's sprinkling the powder.

1250
00:59:54,174 --> 00:59:55,425
No way. What's that?

1251
00:59:58,428 --> 00:59:59,721
That's a whole show!

1252
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,766
- That's crazy.
- I'm speechless.

1253
01:00:03,183 --> 01:00:06,478
<i>I wanted to attract more attention</i>
<i>to the texture and the color</i>

1254
01:00:06,561 --> 01:00:09,439
<i>to showcase a true red horse</i>
<i>with its bold energy.</i>

1255
01:00:10,315 --> 01:00:11,608
Five more seconds.

1256
01:00:11,983 --> 01:00:16,154
One, two, three, four, five. All done.

1257
01:00:16,238 --> 01:00:18,615
Hold your breath for 15 seconds. One...

1258
01:00:18,865 --> 01:00:21,910
I didn't expect her
to prepare such a look at all.

1259
01:00:22,035 --> 01:00:23,495
Close your mouth and count to five.

1260
01:00:23,578 --> 01:00:25,622
One, two, three...

1261
01:00:25,705 --> 01:00:27,249
Everyone is curious about that spray.

1262
01:00:27,332 --> 01:00:28,625
What is that spray?

1263
01:00:28,708 --> 01:00:30,794
- Everyone is looking at her tools.
- Yes, they are.

1264
01:00:30,877 --> 01:00:32,129
Turn your head slightly.

1265
01:00:32,671 --> 01:00:35,465
One, two, three...

1266
01:00:35,549 --> 01:00:37,717
Fourteen, fifteen. All done.

1267
01:00:38,885 --> 01:00:39,761
That's insane.

1268
01:00:40,178 --> 01:00:42,514
The red looks even more vibrant now.

1269
01:00:43,223 --> 01:00:45,142
Where else would we get to witness this?

1270
01:00:45,225 --> 01:00:46,184
I know.

1271
01:00:46,309 --> 01:00:47,811
She's from Paris,

1272
01:00:47,894 --> 01:00:49,146
so this must be the Parisien style.

1273
01:00:49,229 --> 01:00:50,522
A couture style?

1274
01:00:51,731 --> 01:00:54,067
That look is cool,
but I like that look more.

1275
01:00:55,819 --> 01:00:58,238
I prefer looks with more makeup elements.

1276
01:00:59,531 --> 01:01:00,824
How did she do that?

1277
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:02,450
She's probably using liquid eyeliner.

1278
01:01:02,534 --> 01:01:04,077
Is it liquid eyeliner?

1279
01:01:04,661 --> 01:01:06,538
I knew we had the same topic, Red Horse,

1280
01:01:06,872 --> 01:01:08,123
but I didn't care about my opponent.

1281
01:01:08,206 --> 01:01:10,375
I just kept going and did as I wanted.

1282
01:01:10,709 --> 01:01:13,461
<i>I was reminded of a horse's hooves</i>
<i>when thinking of Red Horse,</i>

1283
01:01:13,545 --> 01:01:16,006
<i>so I left some edgy hoof marks.</i>

1284
01:01:16,089 --> 01:01:18,300
<i>This was a horse on fire,</i>

1285
01:01:18,383 --> 01:01:22,679
<i>so I packed the space between his brows</i>
<i>with golden glitter.</i>

1286
01:01:23,305 --> 01:01:25,348
He looks just like a horse, doesn't he?

1287
01:01:25,473 --> 01:01:28,393
She created a horse using makeup.

1288
01:01:29,394 --> 01:01:31,188
- That also looks amazing, right?
- Yes.

1289
01:01:31,271 --> 01:01:32,439
- She did well.
- She got the right features.

1290
01:01:32,522 --> 01:01:34,399
The gold looks so good on him.

1291
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:37,819
That looks amazing.

1292
01:01:38,820 --> 01:01:41,656
- The two horses look very different.
- You're right.

1293
01:01:42,199 --> 01:01:44,576
One is art and the other is makeup.

1294
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:46,578
That's so cool.

1295
01:01:47,954 --> 01:01:49,289
He looks so good!

1296
01:01:49,789 --> 01:01:50,957
He looks so good!

1297
01:01:52,459 --> 01:01:53,668
<i>She did well.</i>

1298
01:01:53,752 --> 01:01:55,295
But in a different way than me.

1299
01:01:55,378 --> 01:01:57,839
<i>I wouldn't be able to object if she wins.</i>

1300
01:01:57,923 --> 01:01:59,633
<i>It was only a matter</i>
<i>of personal preference.</i>

1301
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,804
- Is his whole face red?
- It's fine. We did well.

1302
01:02:04,888 --> 01:02:05,889
Yes, we did.

1303
01:02:06,306 --> 01:02:08,975
<i>Her look was so unique</i>

1304
01:02:09,059 --> 01:02:11,561
<i>that I thought some may be</i>
<i>taken aback by it.</i>

1305
01:02:11,645 --> 01:02:13,730
- Glitter Master is so good at makeup.
- I agree.

1306
01:02:13,813 --> 01:02:15,857
I love her style better.

1307
01:02:15,941 --> 01:02:18,985
Same. It looks better in my eyes, too.

1308
01:02:19,069 --> 01:02:20,153
Glitter Master's look.

1309
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:22,614
Golden Hand in Paris
is holding a makeup class right now.

1310
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,449
- It's in session.
- It's a class.

1311
01:02:24,532 --> 01:02:26,409
Let's vote.

1312
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,328
- Shall we?
- It's so hard.

1313
01:02:28,453 --> 01:02:29,537
It's a really hard call.

1314
01:02:29,704 --> 01:02:31,581
It's all about perspectives now.

1315
01:02:31,665 --> 01:02:33,458
- She's all about the details.
- What?

1316
01:02:33,625 --> 01:02:35,418
And her look is so show-worthy.

1317
01:02:35,502 --> 01:02:39,589
Please cut these parts completely.

1318
01:02:39,673 --> 01:02:41,591
And keep his hair super light, please.

1319
01:02:41,675 --> 01:02:42,759
THE ARTIST DESIGNS THE OVERALL LOOK
INCLUDING THE HAIR AND THE OUTFIT

1320
01:02:42,884 --> 01:02:45,637
Can we add more volume to the baby hairs?

1321
01:02:45,887 --> 01:02:48,682
Please cut it in the middle
so it spreads out.

1322
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:51,351
She's directing all the designers.

1323
01:02:51,434 --> 01:02:53,061
- For the look.
- That's so cool.

1324
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,648
I didn't know there were two ways
to make a red horse look so incredible.

1325
01:02:57,315 --> 01:02:59,651
Both models look astounding.

1326
01:03:00,193 --> 01:03:01,945
- I can't wait for the final looks.
- Me neither.

1327
01:03:02,028 --> 01:03:03,196
It's an intense battle.

1328
01:03:06,116 --> 01:03:08,868
- Fly!
- They're really flying!

1329
01:03:10,120 --> 01:03:11,538
- The judges will be quite surprised.
- I bet.

1330
01:03:12,205 --> 01:03:14,374
They really look like red horses.

1331
01:03:14,791 --> 01:03:16,167
They look great.

1332
01:03:18,586 --> 01:03:19,713
They must be coming.

1333
01:03:20,630 --> 01:03:22,507
- Are they coming now?
- Yes.

1334
01:03:22,674 --> 01:03:26,052
Red Horse!
I've been most eager to see this pair!

1335
01:03:26,136 --> 01:03:29,097
Is there a particular look
you want to see for Red Horse?

1336
01:03:29,222 --> 01:03:31,308
The difference
between a professional and an amateur

1337
01:03:31,391 --> 01:03:34,269
is that when they're given keywords
like "flower," "horse," and alike,

1338
01:03:34,352 --> 01:03:37,564
an amateur creates a look
that clearly reflects the keyword,

1339
01:03:37,647 --> 01:03:40,608
while a professional uses
symbolic elements for their look,

1340
01:03:41,067 --> 01:03:43,820
- which elevates the look.
- I can imagine.

1341
01:03:43,903 --> 01:03:46,281
I don't want to see two horses walking in.

1342
01:03:46,364 --> 01:03:49,075
It'd be bad if they neighed, right?

1343
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:51,870
I wonder who wanted this keyword.

1344
01:03:51,953 --> 01:03:54,497
- They must be very strong, right?
- Very cool people.

1345
01:03:54,581 --> 01:03:55,790
People who love challenges.

1346
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:57,876
Will we see content creators?

1347
01:04:10,722 --> 01:04:11,681
This way.

1348
01:04:13,516 --> 01:04:14,684
We wait here?

1349
01:04:14,768 --> 01:04:16,186
I guess they can't see us yet.

1350
01:04:17,187 --> 01:04:18,897
- They can't see us from that side?
- No.

1351
01:04:18,980 --> 01:04:20,607
- Only we can see them?
- Yes.

1352
01:04:20,690 --> 01:04:22,359
Director Jung, it's me!

1353
01:04:22,442 --> 01:04:24,069
It's me! I'm here!

1354
01:04:25,779 --> 01:04:26,780
Oh, my gosh.

1355
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:30,658
<i>What will the judges think of my look?</i>

1356
01:04:30,992 --> 01:04:31,868
<i>It's time.</i>

1357
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:34,287
<i>We can finally hear</i>
<i>their objective opinions.</i>

1358
01:04:34,454 --> 01:04:38,249
Now then, models for Red Horse,
please enter.

1359
01:04:49,761 --> 01:04:50,637
That's bold.

1360
01:04:51,888 --> 01:04:53,181
<i>They took my breath away.</i>

1361
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:54,516
<i>I was astounded.</i>

1362
01:04:54,599 --> 01:04:57,060
<i>It was so shocking.</i>

1363
01:04:57,811 --> 01:05:00,814
How could they have portrayed
the theme that way?

1364
01:05:03,149 --> 01:05:04,484
<i>Absolutely incredible.</i>

1365
01:05:07,028 --> 01:05:08,780
<i>How am I supposed to judge this?</i>

1366
01:06:07,547 --> 01:06:09,549
