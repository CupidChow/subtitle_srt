1
00:00:05,572 --> 00:00:09,142
The winner of the Painting mission
of New Face

2
00:00:09,509 --> 00:00:11,077
to advance to the finals is...

3
00:00:14,848 --> 00:00:16,516
<i>I've worked really hard.</i>

4
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:18,485
<i>It would be great</i>
<i>if I advanced to the finals.</i>

5
00:00:18,551 --> 00:00:21,021
<i>Maybe I'll be able to sit up there.</i>

6
00:00:21,721 --> 00:00:23,023
<i>I'm looking forward to it.</i>

7
00:00:23,757 --> 00:00:26,292
<i>I was very satisfied with my makeup.</i>

8
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:28,128
<i>I'm sure I'll make it.</i>

9
00:00:30,764 --> 00:00:31,865
I'm nervous.

10
00:00:32,298 --> 00:00:33,133
The winner is...

11
00:00:33,767 --> 00:00:35,935
Detailed Hands. Congratulations.

12
00:00:36,236 --> 00:00:38,538
The winner is Detailed Hands.
Congratulations.

13
00:00:39,105 --> 00:00:40,373
Thank you.

14
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,909
THE SECOND OF THE TOP 3
DETAILED HANDS

15
00:00:43,109 --> 00:00:45,478
The winner is Detailed Hands.
Congratulations.

16
00:00:47,647 --> 00:00:48,715
Congratulations.

17
00:00:54,054 --> 00:00:56,890
- Her work was insanely detailed.
- Seriously.

18
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:58,558
It was like fine art.

19
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,127
It's crazy.

20
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:03,930
- It was really creative.
- I agree.

21
00:01:03,997 --> 00:01:04,931
It was so moving.

22
00:01:04,998 --> 00:01:06,633
She showed a new kind of coolness.

23
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:08,535
A new side of Detailed Hands.

24
00:01:08,601 --> 00:01:11,671
- I could feel her deep love for her work.
- Right.

25
00:01:11,938 --> 00:01:15,875
This actually requires tremendous skills.

26
00:01:15,942 --> 00:01:19,079
<i>Each strand of hair should be detailed.</i>
<i>It shouldn't be too thick.</i>

27
00:01:19,145 --> 00:01:23,016
<i>To do that, she must've used</i>
<i>many different kinds of brushes,</i>

28
00:01:23,083 --> 00:01:26,953
<i>which requires the ability</i>
<i>to use a variety of tools</i>

29
00:01:27,020 --> 00:01:30,590
<i>and to control the amount</i>
<i>of paint applied.</i>

30
00:01:30,657 --> 00:01:34,594
<i>She'd also need the technique</i>
<i>to maintain control of the brush.</i>

31
00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:37,163
<i>It is such a delicate work,</i>

32
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:40,600
so I think we should be grateful
to have even seen it.

33
00:01:40,700 --> 00:01:44,871
I also felt that the contrast
between deep and bright tones,

34
00:01:44,938 --> 00:01:48,341
<i>which perfectly matched the bronzed skin,</i>
<i>was masterfully controlled.</i>

35
00:01:48,408 --> 00:01:51,611
<i>In addition, the hair, headpiece,</i>

36
00:01:51,678 --> 00:01:54,581
<i>and even the outfit</i>
<i>were so perfectly executed</i>

37
00:01:54,647 --> 00:01:58,318
<i>that it felt like</i>
<i>I was looking at a real piece</i>

38
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,520
<i>of fine art.</i>

39
00:02:00,587 --> 00:02:03,890
<i>I think the piece truly showcased</i>

40
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:06,292
<i>the finest detail</i>
<i>a makeup artist can offer.</i>

41
00:02:06,359 --> 00:02:08,995
I was deeply impressed.

42
00:02:09,062 --> 00:02:10,230
Thank you.

43
00:02:10,430 --> 00:02:13,366
Detailed Hands, you are the second
contestant to make it to the finals.

44
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,001
How are you feeling?

45
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:20,840
I feel pressured
but also incredibly happy.

46
00:02:20,907 --> 00:02:24,310
I think I couldn't even eat properly
after hearing about the theme.

47
00:02:25,378 --> 00:02:29,215
As I continued practicing
and began to see improvement,

48
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:31,184
I felt a tremendous sense of joy.

49
00:02:31,251 --> 00:02:33,420
At the same time,

50
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:38,124
I'm so grateful
that it rekindled my passion.

51
00:02:38,525 --> 00:02:39,659
Thank you.

52
00:02:39,859 --> 00:02:41,227
Congratulations again.

53
00:02:41,294 --> 00:02:44,130
Detailed Hands,
please come forward and receive the brush.

54
00:02:44,197 --> 00:02:46,733
You may go to the seats for the finalists.

55
00:02:51,071 --> 00:02:52,639
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

56
00:02:52,706 --> 00:02:53,707
Thank you.

57
00:02:58,678 --> 00:02:59,846
Oh, dear.

58
00:03:01,981 --> 00:03:04,718
You did a great job. You worked so hard.

59
00:03:04,784 --> 00:03:05,885
Here, take one.

60
00:03:05,952 --> 00:03:08,555
Golden Hand in Paris,
what's that yellow thing?

61
00:03:08,621 --> 00:03:12,492
This is what I prepared,
but I didn't have a chance to show it.

62
00:03:12,559 --> 00:03:16,463
That must be what you prepared
for the Ka-madhenu mission.

63
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:18,598
And you gave one to Detailed Hands.

64
00:03:18,665 --> 00:03:19,699
Thank you.

65
00:03:19,766 --> 00:03:21,868
- You did a wonderful job.
- Thank you.

66
00:03:21,935 --> 00:03:22,969
It was beautiful.

67
00:03:24,104 --> 00:03:27,374
I hope that when I get to the final round,
I will work hard

68
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,210
and get great results.

69
00:03:30,844 --> 00:03:32,345
- Oh Dolce Vita.
- Yes.

70
00:03:32,412 --> 00:03:35,215
You made everyone cry,
but you didn't make the candidates.

71
00:03:35,582 --> 00:03:37,984
It's really okay.

72
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,819
I managed to convey my intent anyway.

73
00:03:40,353 --> 00:03:43,890
Actually, it was a big risk
to use my mom as my model.

74
00:03:43,957 --> 00:03:47,961
I'm just happy that
I finished the mission without regrets.

75
00:03:48,028 --> 00:03:49,229
Thank you.

76
00:03:49,295 --> 00:03:51,965
Now, the eight contestants shall prepare

77
00:03:52,198 --> 00:03:54,267
for the final mission.

78
00:03:57,337 --> 00:03:58,638
They're going in again.

79
00:03:59,339 --> 00:04:01,441
- They're going back in there.
- Again.

80
00:04:01,508 --> 00:04:03,109
Oh, come on. We're going back in.

81
00:04:03,777 --> 00:04:05,178
We're doing it again.

82
00:04:11,985 --> 00:04:15,655
WHEN THE SEMIFINAL MISSION WAS REVEALED
Please show us the last mission.

83
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:22,429
<i>Last night, a mother mermaid</i>
<i>came walking on her own two feet.</i>

84
00:04:23,463 --> 00:04:25,899
<i>The mother mermaid had hair on her head.</i>

85
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:30,103
<i>It was blue and transparent,</i>
<i>like the tentacles of a jellyfish.</i>

86
00:04:30,503 --> 00:04:34,307
<i>With every step she took,</i>
<i>her thin, long hair swayed.</i>

87
00:04:34,574 --> 00:04:38,044
<i>The silver fins fluttering on her sides</i>

88
00:04:38,511 --> 00:04:41,214
<i>resembled the wings of a butterfly.</i>

89
00:04:41,581 --> 00:04:44,651
<i>MERMAID HUNT </i>BY CHA IN-PYO

90
00:04:44,818 --> 00:04:46,353
This is so difficult.

91
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:47,821
It's really tricky.

92
00:04:47,887 --> 00:04:49,456
What do I do?

93
00:04:49,522 --> 00:04:51,991
The third theme is a novel.

94
00:04:52,359 --> 00:04:53,960
MISSION 3: NOVEL

95
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:55,762
You'd find the voice familiar.

96
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:58,598
It is a novel by Cha In-pyo,
an actor and a novelist.

97
00:04:58,765 --> 00:05:02,002
<i>This is a section describing a mermaid</i>
<i>from the Korean fantasy novel,</i>

98
00:05:02,068 --> 00:05:04,070
<i>Mermaid Hunt.</i>

99
00:05:04,204 --> 00:05:06,106
In this mission,

100
00:05:06,172 --> 00:05:09,843
you are to complete the character
in the novel with a new face.

101
00:05:10,110 --> 00:05:12,746
<i>It's a mission where you visualize</i>
<i>a character described with words.</i>

102
00:05:12,812 --> 00:05:15,882
If things go wrong,
it could turn into a disaster.

103
00:05:16,249 --> 00:05:17,784
I'm most worried
about the mermaid mission.

104
00:05:17,917 --> 00:05:20,353
I'm not sure if I would have the stamina
to last until then.

105
00:05:20,754 --> 00:05:24,357
<i>Again, for this mission, you are supposed</i>
<i>to complete the entire look,</i>

106
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,627
<i>including makeup, hair, and outfit</i>
<i>within 120 minutes.</i>

107
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:30,363
Now we have only one spot left

108
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:32,265
for the top three.

109
00:05:32,332 --> 00:05:35,835
Who among you will take the last seat?

110
00:05:35,902 --> 00:05:39,339
Now, please grab your brushes
and get started.

111
00:05:40,206 --> 00:05:41,274
Let's go!

112
00:05:42,275 --> 00:05:43,843
Let's get changed first.

113
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:46,346
Come this way. Please get changed first.

114
00:05:46,413 --> 00:05:48,782
MACtist seems more energetic
than in the previous mission.

115
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,216
- I know, right?
- Yes.

116
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:51,785
- It looks like...
- He looks quite energetic.

117
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:54,988
Feels like he's going to create
an actual mermaid.

118
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:59,325
<i>When I read Mermaid Hunt by Cha In-pyo,</i>

119
00:05:59,392 --> 00:06:00,894
<i>I actually had a dream.</i>

120
00:06:01,394 --> 00:06:03,630
<i>The skin is incredibly radiant,</i>

121
00:06:03,697 --> 00:06:05,732
<i>and the body is so glittery</i>

122
00:06:05,799 --> 00:06:08,134
<i>that you could almost see through it.</i>

123
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:10,437
<i>I worked without too much thought,</i>

124
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:12,472
<i>just following my hand</i>

125
00:06:12,672 --> 00:06:16,509
<i>and focusing on creating</i>
<i>the mermaid image I had in mind.</i>

126
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,379
Close your eyes.

127
00:06:19,446 --> 00:06:22,082
<i>For me,</i>
<i>the skin is the highlight of my work.</i>

128
00:06:22,349 --> 00:06:25,785
<i>I wanted to show a skin gloss of a mermaid</i>
<i>that's on another level.</i>

129
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:30,123
<i>I want to create a clean, poreless look</i>

130
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:31,891
<i>because a mermaid isn't a human.</i>

131
00:06:32,092 --> 00:06:36,229
But I think First Man is on another level.

132
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:38,031
I see. Why do you think so?

133
00:06:38,098 --> 00:06:41,835
I don't think he always starts
with the base makeup.

134
00:06:41,901 --> 00:06:43,103
He always exceeds expectations.

135
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:48,875
<i>A beautiful marine creature</i>
<i>living deep in the ocean,</i>

136
00:06:49,042 --> 00:06:52,345
<i>that is completely unknown to us.</i>

137
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:55,715
<i>My true intention</i>

138
00:06:55,782 --> 00:06:58,585
is to showcase really pretty makeup.

139
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,220
It's beautiful.

140
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,622
The color variations are just beautiful.

141
00:07:02,689 --> 00:07:06,192
I agree that he is on another level.

142
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:08,294
Have you read the book?

143
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,063
- Yes, I have.
- I see.

144
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:11,531
Of course, you did.

145
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:13,967
- Because you're a model student.
- A model student.

146
00:07:14,034 --> 00:07:16,903
<i>When her baby is harassed by people,</i>

147
00:07:16,970 --> 00:07:21,074
<i>the mother mermaid goes to rescue her,</i>
<i>knowing it can put her in danger.</i>

148
00:07:21,141 --> 00:07:24,577
I felt a sense of pathos
more than maternal love from her.

149
00:07:24,644 --> 00:07:27,514
That's the feeling I'm trying to capture.

150
00:07:27,881 --> 00:07:30,884
The word "pathos" is quite impressive.

151
00:07:30,950 --> 00:07:34,954
<i>They all prepared and studied</i>
<i>a lot for this mission.</i>

152
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:38,758
<i>I can't believe</i>
<i>only one of them will survive here.</i>

153
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:39,926
<i>That's too harsh.</i>

154
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:45,098
<i>The world of competition is so brutal.</i>

155
00:07:45,165 --> 00:07:47,434
MISSION 3: NOVEL
JUDGING BEGINS

156
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:50,870
- I'm aching all over.
- I'm tired.

157
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,306
Did you have enough time?

158
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,443
I didn't know two hours would be so short.

159
00:07:56,509 --> 00:07:57,777
My point, exactly.

160
00:07:58,178 --> 00:08:00,814
It's impressive that everyone made it.

161
00:08:00,880 --> 00:08:02,716
I know. They all did it anyway.

162
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,752
Everyone, did you give everything you had?

163
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:06,820
- Yes.
- Yes.

164
00:08:06,886 --> 00:08:07,921
Do you not have any regrets?

165
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:09,589
- We don't have any regrets.
- No.

166
00:08:09,656 --> 00:08:12,859
Makeup Trendsetter
really seems to have no regrets at all.

167
00:08:12,926 --> 00:08:17,897
It's like she's saying
she cannot do any more makeup.

168
00:08:18,031 --> 00:08:19,766
I appreciate all your hard work.

169
00:08:19,866 --> 00:08:23,370
Now, we have someone
who wants to meet your mermaids

170
00:08:23,436 --> 00:08:25,805
more than anyone else.

171
00:08:26,539 --> 00:08:30,276
He's an actor who has found
his new face as a novelist.

172
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,512
Here is the actor... Or rather,

173
00:08:32,579 --> 00:08:34,814
the novelist, Cha In-pyo.

174
00:08:34,881 --> 00:08:35,949
Welcome.

175
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:45,425
He's so handsome.

176
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,227
- He's so cool.
- Oh, wow.

177
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,229
- Hello.
- Welcome.

178
00:08:50,597 --> 00:08:52,098
- Isn't he so handsome?
- My goodness.

179
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:53,266
I can't believe it.

180
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:54,968
Mermaid!

181
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:58,405
- Hello. Nice to meet you.
- Hello.

182
00:08:58,505 --> 00:09:00,140
- Hello.
- Nice to meet you.

183
00:09:00,206 --> 00:09:02,342
- It's been a while.
- Have you been doing well?

184
00:09:02,409 --> 00:09:03,877
- Hello.
- My gosh.

185
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:06,312
- Hello. It's good to see you.
- Likewise.

186
00:09:06,846 --> 00:09:08,214
Hello.

187
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:11,651
You've come all this way for JUST MAKEUP.

188
00:09:11,718 --> 00:09:12,852
Please say hello.

189
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:15,655
I'm Cha In-pyo, an actor and a novelist.

190
00:09:15,722 --> 00:09:17,057
Nice to meet you.

191
00:09:20,260 --> 00:09:22,362
Your work, <i>Hunting Mermaid,</i>

192
00:09:22,429 --> 00:09:25,298
is receiving rave reviews
in the Korean literary community

193
00:09:25,365 --> 00:09:27,634
and is gaining attention overseas as well.

194
00:09:27,701 --> 00:09:29,903
My book is being used
as a translation textbook

195
00:09:29,969 --> 00:09:32,172
<i>by the 3rd and 4th-year</i>
<i>Korean literature students</i>

196
00:09:32,238 --> 00:09:34,140
<i>at Istanbul University in Tükiye.</i>

197
00:09:34,374 --> 00:09:36,409
And it's also being translated
into Chinese.

198
00:09:38,178 --> 00:09:42,082
Our contestants created
their own mermaids today

199
00:09:42,382 --> 00:09:45,318
based on the mermaid from the novel.

200
00:09:45,585 --> 00:09:48,455
In my novel, the mother mermaid

201
00:09:48,521 --> 00:09:51,591
lives only in the deep sea.

202
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:54,761
That means there is no light.

203
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,664
So, I thought the mermaid

204
00:09:57,731 --> 00:09:59,165
would look like an East Asian painting.

205
00:09:59,866 --> 00:10:01,701
In monochrome

206
00:10:02,002 --> 00:10:06,373
or perhaps
something transparent like jellyfish.

207
00:10:06,439 --> 00:10:08,875
That's what I imagined.

208
00:10:08,942 --> 00:10:12,912
So, that's the image of the mother mermaid
that the author had in mind.

209
00:10:12,979 --> 00:10:15,615
I'm very curious to see

210
00:10:15,682 --> 00:10:19,085
how our contestants
portrayed their mother mermaids.

211
00:10:19,152 --> 00:10:20,854
- I can't wait to find out.
- Yes.

212
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,123
Now, we will reveal
the eight mermaids with new faces

213
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:26,292
that will determine the final survivor

214
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:28,628
for the top three.

215
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,805
<i>Last night, a mother mermaid</i>
<i>came walking on her own two feet.</i>

216
00:10:39,305 --> 00:10:43,043
- My goodness.
<i>- ...walking on her own two feet.</i>

217
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,314
<i>The mother mermaid's appearance</i>
<i>was different from that of the male.</i>

218
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:53,186
<i>Unlike the males and babies who were bald,</i>

219
00:10:53,253 --> 00:10:55,655
<i>the mother mermaid had hair on her head.</i>

220
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,493
<i>It was blue and transparent,</i>

221
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,496
<i>like the tentacles of a jellyfish.</i>

222
00:11:04,597 --> 00:11:08,335
<i>With every step she took,</i>
<i>her thin, long hair swayed.</i>

223
00:11:11,504 --> 00:11:14,908
<i>The silver fins fluttering on her sides</i>

224
00:11:15,442 --> 00:11:18,178
<i>resembled the wings of a butterfly.</i>

225
00:11:21,915 --> 00:11:26,319
<i>MERMAID HUNT </i>BY CHA IN-PYO

226
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:04,324
<i>When the eight mermaids</i>
<i>emerged from the water,</i>

227
00:12:04,391 --> 00:12:06,993
<i>I thought they were truly beautiful.</i>

228
00:12:07,827 --> 00:12:11,998
<i>I was thrilled to see</i>
<i>the images I'd imagined in the text</i>

229
00:12:12,332 --> 00:12:14,467
<i>come to life.</i>

230
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:21,508
I can't wait to see them up close.

231
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,809
Me too.

232
00:12:24,411 --> 00:12:27,414
It feels like
the eight sparkling, beautiful mermaids

233
00:12:27,480 --> 00:12:31,751
are staring at us
from the depths of the ocean.

234
00:12:31,818 --> 00:12:34,220
Seeing what I'd described in words

235
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:37,957
brought to life by the makeup artists,

236
00:12:38,291 --> 00:12:41,027
- it makes my heart flutter.
- I see.

237
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:45,799
It feels like I'm looking at mermaids
from fairy tales.

238
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,034
- You want to see it up close, right?
- Yes, I do.

239
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:53,006
All right, now we'll begin
judging the Novel mission.

240
00:12:53,606 --> 00:12:55,375
I wonder how it will go.

241
00:12:56,409 --> 00:12:59,713
First Man,
please come forward with your model.

242
00:13:01,014 --> 00:13:02,349
This is the third time.

243
00:13:17,163 --> 00:13:19,065
This is First Man's work.

244
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,641
- I want to see it up close.
- Me too.

245
00:13:29,042 --> 00:13:32,145
If she lived deep in the ocean,

246
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:36,016
I thought her body colors
would be incredibly mysterious.

247
00:13:36,416 --> 00:13:41,154
<i>So I wanted to display the skin</i>

248
00:13:41,221 --> 00:13:42,956
<i>of a beautiful marine creature.</i>

249
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:45,325
<i>To me, a mermaid</i>

250
00:13:45,392 --> 00:13:48,294
is beautiful,
but a bit scary at the same time.

251
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:49,929
I wanted to express

252
00:13:49,996 --> 00:13:52,832
a slightly grotesque side,
not just pure beauty.

253
00:13:52,899 --> 00:13:56,002
For example, the colors
used for the eyes are a bit...

254
00:13:56,202 --> 00:13:59,339
<i>Those are colors</i>
<i>that are difficult to define.</i>

255
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,974
<i>I completed the makeup</i>

256
00:14:01,041 --> 00:14:03,109
<i>by arranging the colors</i>

257
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,979
<i>while considering</i>
<i>their gradation and harmony.</i>

258
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:08,815
The green color should stand out here.

259
00:14:09,149 --> 00:14:12,952
<i>I used different colors on the chest</i>

260
00:14:13,019 --> 00:14:15,388
<i>to create a contrast.</i>

261
00:14:15,588 --> 00:14:19,325
<i>I used slightly champagne-gold colors</i>

262
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:22,328
<i>from the collarbones to the upper chest,</i>

263
00:14:22,395 --> 00:14:24,397
<i>creating gradations of colors.</i>

264
00:14:24,464 --> 00:14:28,568
<i>And it transitioned to a more vivid blue</i>
<i>toward the stomach.</i>

265
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:33,273
I found one sentence in the novel
particularly unique.

266
00:14:33,340 --> 00:14:35,775
It described the mermaid
as having two legs.

267
00:14:36,276 --> 00:14:40,747
<i>He made a point</i>
<i>to describe the mermaid as having legs.</i>

268
00:14:40,814 --> 00:14:43,083
That's something
that shouldn't be overlooked.

269
00:14:43,149 --> 00:14:46,386
<i>I thought the styling</i>
<i>that best symbolized those legs</i>

270
00:14:46,453 --> 00:14:47,587
<i>was a pair of pants.</i>

271
00:14:47,654 --> 00:14:48,621
<i>I see.</i>

272
00:14:48,688 --> 00:14:50,757
- I find the interpretation interesting.
- It's fascinating.

273
00:14:51,224 --> 00:14:52,392
Pose.

274
00:14:58,164 --> 00:15:00,567
What mysterious colors.

275
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:01,534
Really.

276
00:15:02,002 --> 00:15:04,237
It's beautiful, isn't it?

277
00:15:04,838 --> 00:15:07,107
- She's wearing makeup even on her hands.
- Right.

278
00:15:07,173 --> 00:15:08,775
They look like webbed feet.

279
00:15:08,842 --> 00:15:09,909
Right. The colors.

280
00:15:11,511 --> 00:15:15,248
The lip gloss is flowing down to her chin.

281
00:15:15,315 --> 00:15:16,616
- Is that what you intended?
- No.

282
00:15:17,183 --> 00:15:19,019
Actually, this is why

283
00:15:19,085 --> 00:15:20,954
I chose to be the first presenter.

284
00:15:21,021 --> 00:15:22,655
- I wanted to prevent it from melting.
- I see.

285
00:15:22,722 --> 00:15:25,058
And yet, it has happened.

286
00:15:25,258 --> 00:15:27,193
<i>Before the judging begins,</i>

287
00:15:27,260 --> 00:15:29,562
there's a gap of about ten minutes.

288
00:15:29,629 --> 00:15:34,134
<i>The lip gloss itself</i>
<i>worked as a cleanser and melted.</i>

289
00:15:34,734 --> 00:15:36,069
It looks like
she just came out of the water.

290
00:15:36,136 --> 00:15:38,171
- Right.
- It looks like she came out of the water.

291
00:15:38,238 --> 00:15:40,206
It looks as if you intended to do this.

292
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,444
We're still just admiring the work.

293
00:15:45,679 --> 00:15:46,780
- Yes.
- We're still admiring it.

294
00:15:47,514 --> 00:15:49,249
- It's really cool.
- It's amazing.

295
00:15:49,315 --> 00:15:50,417
It's wonderful.

296
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:53,853
I think I spent a long time

297
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,523
looking at First Man's work.

298
00:15:56,656 --> 00:15:57,891
It's truly stunning.

299
00:15:58,825 --> 00:16:01,594
It has a very dreamy feel,

300
00:16:01,661 --> 00:16:03,697
and there's a hint

301
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:06,766
<i>of grayish blue around the eye makeup.</i>

302
00:16:07,067 --> 00:16:10,770
I thought this was a work of someone
with such a keen understanding of color

303
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:15,475
who captured the overall look so well.

304
00:16:15,542 --> 00:16:17,711
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

305
00:16:18,011 --> 00:16:19,346
I'm truly honored.

306
00:16:20,914 --> 00:16:22,749
The mermaid is beautiful,

307
00:16:22,816 --> 00:16:25,518
yet also has a poignant sadness.

308
00:16:25,585 --> 00:16:28,755
It looks like she's just emerged
from the depths of the sea.

309
00:16:28,822 --> 00:16:31,858
The way the purple color stretches out

310
00:16:31,925 --> 00:16:34,894
like webbed feet on both hands

311
00:16:34,961 --> 00:16:37,530
closely resembles the image I had in mind

312
00:16:37,597 --> 00:16:40,734
while writing my novel,
a color extending like a stream.

313
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:41,735
Thank you for your work.

314
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,270
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

315
00:16:45,138 --> 00:16:48,308
First Man, after having gone through
three rounds of judging,

316
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:51,311
you seem quite tired.

317
00:16:51,378 --> 00:16:52,812
Your suit was clean at first,

318
00:16:52,879 --> 00:16:55,215
but it's now covered

319
00:16:55,415 --> 00:16:58,818
with glitter and makeup products.

320
00:16:58,885 --> 00:17:00,653
I think you look even cooler this way.

321
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,322
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

322
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,229
That was so cool.

323
00:17:10,630 --> 00:17:12,899
- It looks like she was captured.
- You're right.

324
00:17:12,966 --> 00:17:15,402
It looks like
the mermaid was just captured.

325
00:17:16,569 --> 00:17:19,839
MACtist,
please come forward with your model.

326
00:17:26,980 --> 00:17:29,082
- That's really...
- It's truly bold.

327
00:17:29,149 --> 00:17:31,117
This is MACtist's work.

328
00:17:35,889 --> 00:17:38,358
The mermaid I imagined

329
00:17:38,425 --> 00:17:40,627
would have transparent skin.

330
00:17:40,694 --> 00:17:42,662
But when she comes out to the water,

331
00:17:42,729 --> 00:17:44,464
<i>she would walk on two legs</i>

332
00:17:44,531 --> 00:17:46,766
<i>and transform into a human</i>
<i>for a brief moment.</i>

333
00:17:47,067 --> 00:17:51,671
I used holographic circular sequins

334
00:17:51,738 --> 00:17:54,774
<i>to express that fleeting moment</i>

335
00:17:54,841 --> 00:17:57,544
<i>where her scales would come off</i>
<i>and disappear.</i>

336
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:04,718
These sequins constantly change color

337
00:18:04,784 --> 00:18:07,087
- depending on the angle.
- Yes.

338
00:18:07,153 --> 00:18:11,024
Did you calculate
how the color would shift

339
00:18:11,091 --> 00:18:12,025
as a part of your design?

340
00:18:12,092 --> 00:18:13,426
It wasn't necessarily calculated.

341
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:18,164
<i>I just focused on placing the sequins</i>
<i>in areas that stick out,</i>

342
00:18:18,231 --> 00:18:21,101
like cheekbones, and in areas
we typically highlight on a face.

343
00:18:21,167 --> 00:18:23,236
I just placed them where my hands went.

344
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,638
Since it was the last round,

345
00:18:25,705 --> 00:18:27,674
I just applied them the way I wanted.

346
00:18:31,444 --> 00:18:34,147
All the way down to her hands.
He paid a lot of attention

347
00:18:35,782 --> 00:18:36,950
to the body makeup.

348
00:18:37,217 --> 00:18:39,819
- Even your hands...
- You are very sparkly right now.

349
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:41,988
- Right.
- From head to toe.

350
00:18:43,089 --> 00:18:44,524
<i>He's become a mermaid,</i>
<i>just like the model.</i>

351
00:18:46,659 --> 00:18:51,264
You demonstrated with your whole body
the immense joy of creating something

352
00:18:51,331 --> 00:18:54,300
from your own imagination.

353
00:18:54,367 --> 00:18:58,004
It's a very close image to how I imagined

354
00:18:58,271 --> 00:19:00,740
the word "mermaid,"

355
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:03,276
so I was very happy to see your work.

356
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:04,744
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

357
00:19:04,811 --> 00:19:09,082
I never expected you'd be able
to embody scales like this.

358
00:19:09,616 --> 00:19:13,720
If I'd known
you could do things like this,

359
00:19:13,787 --> 00:19:17,357
I would've tried to depict it in my novel.

360
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,892
- Thank you.
- Thank you so much

361
00:19:18,958 --> 00:19:21,494
for reinterpreting my writing
so beautifully.

362
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:24,097
I could try an interesting makeup look
thanks to your work.

363
00:19:24,431 --> 00:19:25,432
Thank you.

364
00:19:25,498 --> 00:19:26,966
Thank you for your great work.

365
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:29,803
Watch your step.

366
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:34,674
I'm glad that he seems to like it.

367
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:39,245
- You did a great job.
- Oh, my goodness.

368
00:19:40,647 --> 00:19:44,217
Makeup Model Student,
please come forward with your model.

369
00:19:44,484 --> 00:19:45,752
I can't wait to see her work.

370
00:19:59,499 --> 00:20:01,334
She's walking barefoot.

371
00:20:01,935 --> 00:20:03,636
I think she did something to her feet.

372
00:20:04,738 --> 00:20:06,873
This is Makeup Model Student's work.

373
00:20:13,179 --> 00:20:14,848
It looks like the model is close to tears.

374
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,951
The area under her eyes and nose is red.

375
00:20:18,018 --> 00:20:21,354
When I read <i>Mermaid Hunt,</i>

376
00:20:21,421 --> 00:20:24,524
I felt a bit sad for the mother mermaid.

377
00:20:24,591 --> 00:20:27,427
The mother mermaid comes out of the water

378
00:20:27,494 --> 00:20:31,731
because her children have been captured.
She must come out to rescue them.

379
00:20:31,798 --> 00:20:35,435
I described
the slightly reddened corners of her eyes,

380
00:20:35,502 --> 00:20:39,406
<i>as if she were sobbing</i>
<i>to save her children.</i>

381
00:20:40,040 --> 00:20:43,610
<i>I used silver pearls</i>
<i>to express the mermaid's tears.</i>

382
00:20:43,677 --> 00:20:46,413
<i>I wanted to portray</i>
<i>the mother mermaid as a bit pitiful.</i>

383
00:20:46,646 --> 00:20:49,649
I wanted to portray a mermaid
who wasn't too pretty.

384
00:20:49,949 --> 00:20:51,317
It looks like
the mermaid is really crying.

385
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:53,119
I know. It really does.

386
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,956
And I applied some pieces around her lips

387
00:20:57,023 --> 00:20:59,492
as mermaids wouldn't speak human language.

388
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,097
So I thought her lips would be covered
with things like barnacles or clams.

389
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,999
It looks very sad.

390
00:21:06,066 --> 00:21:07,734
- It looks sad?
- Yes.

391
00:21:07,801 --> 00:21:11,204
<i>A mother stepping out to rescue her child</i>
<i>would be sad, of course.</i>

392
00:21:14,808 --> 00:21:17,377
- I wish I could find her child for her.
- Right.

393
00:21:17,444 --> 00:21:20,180
- It's sad.
- She really looks pitiful.

394
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:25,085
The makeup on the eyelashes
is very unique.

395
00:21:25,151 --> 00:21:28,521
Those eyelashes slightly droop,
covering the pupils.

396
00:21:28,588 --> 00:21:31,024
I thought about what could add
a sense of wistful longing

397
00:21:31,091 --> 00:21:33,326
and chose the white color.

398
00:21:33,393 --> 00:21:36,963
<i>- I cut the ends slightly bluntly.</i>
<i>- I see.</i>

399
00:21:37,163 --> 00:21:39,499
- For a rough feeling.
- The eyelashes aren't so sharp.

400
00:21:39,566 --> 00:21:42,302
They just look like
they've never been groomed,

401
00:21:42,369 --> 00:21:44,504
and yet I wanted
to express thick eyelashes.

402
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,473
And I thought

403
00:21:46,539 --> 00:21:48,842
it would be strange for her to wear shoes
when she's here to rescue her child.

404
00:21:48,908 --> 00:21:51,244
<i>I was inspired by the part in the novel</i>

405
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,847
where it says
that the feet get bluer at the tips,

406
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,049
and that's how I expressed the bare feet

407
00:21:56,116 --> 00:21:57,884
covered with scales.

408
00:21:58,151 --> 00:22:00,820
When she first stepped out
with her blue feet,

409
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:03,456
I felt the sorrow of a mother

410
00:22:03,523 --> 00:22:07,227
with her feet bruised
from searching for her child.

411
00:22:11,598 --> 00:22:12,832
Not again...

412
00:22:12,899 --> 00:22:14,401
No. We shouldn't cry.

413
00:22:17,103 --> 00:22:21,341
The mermaid I'm seeing
on the screen right now

414
00:22:22,742 --> 00:22:24,544
feels so desperate.

415
00:22:24,611 --> 00:22:27,614
I can sense her desperation
to find her child.

416
00:22:28,048 --> 00:22:30,083
Makeup Model Student,

417
00:22:30,150 --> 00:22:33,119
I don't think you've ever been
a mother before.

418
00:22:34,387 --> 00:22:35,989
How old are you?

419
00:22:36,589 --> 00:22:38,058
I was born in 1995.

420
00:22:38,124 --> 00:22:40,527
I see. Can you believe this?

421
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,196
- This makes no sense.
- You were born in 1995.

422
00:22:43,263 --> 00:22:47,867
And yet, how could someone so young
have such sensibilities?

423
00:22:48,268 --> 00:22:50,370
Come to think of it,

424
00:22:51,137 --> 00:22:54,074
it's only possible
because you're an artist.

425
00:22:54,140 --> 00:22:57,210
You read the novel and captured
the poignant, desperate desire

426
00:22:57,277 --> 00:23:00,480
of the mermaid to find her child,

427
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:04,184
even risking her own life.

428
00:23:04,250 --> 00:23:06,953
I believe you expressed
those feelings very well.

429
00:23:07,020 --> 00:23:10,223
I kept getting emotional
as I looked at your work.

430
00:23:10,290 --> 00:23:12,959
I enjoyed it a lot with such gratitude.

431
00:23:13,026 --> 00:23:14,327
Thank you.

432
00:23:14,394 --> 00:23:17,597
When I was writing <i>Mermaid Hunt,</i>

433
00:23:18,298 --> 00:23:20,767
I thought of the mother mermaid

434
00:23:20,834 --> 00:23:23,069
as having the ability
to overcome adversity,

435
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,172
like nature, which tries to recover
even after suffering.

436
00:23:26,439 --> 00:23:29,743
Seeing the mother mermaid here before me,

437
00:23:29,943 --> 00:23:32,746
I feel that she's the mermaid
from my novel.

438
00:23:32,812 --> 00:23:34,180
I really liked it. Thank you.

439
00:23:34,247 --> 00:23:36,049
Thank you for your great work.

440
00:23:36,116 --> 00:23:37,517
Thank you.

441
00:23:37,584 --> 00:23:38,585
Let's go.

442
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:42,589
She is a model student, indeed.

443
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:45,025
- She studies a lot.
- I know.

444
00:23:46,192 --> 00:23:49,396
Next up is Designer Collector's work.

445
00:23:51,131 --> 00:23:56,403
<i>Mermaid Hunt </i>is a novel
set in ancient Korea.

446
00:23:56,469 --> 00:24:00,106
So I decided to focus
on how to best portray

447
00:24:00,173 --> 00:24:05,612
a Korean mermaid
as an East Asian painting.

448
00:24:05,679 --> 00:24:08,248
The key to the makeup
was the silver color.

449
00:24:09,249 --> 00:24:11,084
<i>Silver with a hint of white,</i>

450
00:24:11,384 --> 00:24:14,020
<i>silver with a hint of pink,</i>

451
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,523
<i>and silver with a hint of black.</i>

452
00:24:16,589 --> 00:24:19,759
<i>I focused on layering</i>
<i>these various silver colors</i>

453
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:23,430
<i>to create a richer, more vibrant color.</i>

454
00:24:24,597 --> 00:24:28,068
<i>I also used a wig to create the feeling</i>

455
00:24:28,134 --> 00:24:31,037
<i>of looking at an East Asian painting.</i>

456
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,007
So, she is a K-mermaid.

457
00:24:34,074 --> 00:24:36,276
- That's right.
- But her eye color looks quite foreign.

458
00:24:36,343 --> 00:24:39,346
Right. Since she lived in the deep sea,

459
00:24:39,412 --> 00:24:42,182
<i>I thought her eyes would glow blue</i>

460
00:24:42,248 --> 00:24:45,085
when not exposed to sunlight.

461
00:24:45,151 --> 00:24:47,153
That's how I came up with the look.

462
00:24:47,987 --> 00:24:51,825
First of all, the model's image
seems very Korean.

463
00:24:51,891 --> 00:24:54,994
I think you did a great job
selecting the model.

464
00:24:55,061 --> 00:24:57,664
The overall color variation

465
00:24:57,731 --> 00:24:59,699
was beautifully expressed.

466
00:24:59,766 --> 00:25:01,768
And the wig,

467
00:25:01,835 --> 00:25:04,437
which added a bit of a Korean element,

468
00:25:04,504 --> 00:25:07,107
really resonated with me.

469
00:25:07,374 --> 00:25:10,110
I thought this might be the birth

470
00:25:10,176 --> 00:25:13,680
of a K-mermaid,
something we'd never seen before.

471
00:25:13,747 --> 00:25:14,981
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

472
00:25:16,383 --> 00:25:18,151
It's Beauty Heiress's turn now.

473
00:25:18,218 --> 00:25:20,453
This is Beauty Heiress's work.

474
00:25:24,624 --> 00:25:29,396
Actually, when the author described
the mother mermaid earlier,

475
00:25:29,462 --> 00:25:30,964
I was really surprised.

476
00:25:31,031 --> 00:25:34,901
He mentioned everything
that I wanted to express.

477
00:25:34,968 --> 00:25:37,137
The incredibly pale skin

478
00:25:37,203 --> 00:25:40,206
and a transparent, mysterious look.

479
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,176
<i>There's something called</i>
<i>chrome powder for nails.</i>

480
00:25:43,243 --> 00:25:46,279
<i>It creates a really beautiful glow.</i>

481
00:25:46,346 --> 00:25:48,515
<i>It is expressed in a subtle way,</i>

482
00:25:48,581 --> 00:25:52,185
<i>so I first added a touch of mystery</i>
<i>with the eyeshadow.</i>

483
00:25:52,619 --> 00:25:55,522
<i>I mixed various colors</i>

484
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:58,958
<i>to express the mermaid's scales.</i>

485
00:25:59,025 --> 00:26:01,661
<i>The mermaid</i>
<i>that just emerged from the water.</i>

486
00:26:01,728 --> 00:26:04,030
<i>That's what I wanted to portray.</i>

487
00:26:04,097 --> 00:26:07,734
<i>So I added water droplets</i>
<i>that were rising from the bottom up.</i>

488
00:26:07,801 --> 00:26:11,204
<i>I wanted to perfectly express the details</i>

489
00:26:11,271 --> 00:26:13,840
<i>described in the novel.</i>

490
00:26:14,774 --> 00:26:16,976
They look like real water drops.

491
00:26:17,510 --> 00:26:19,446
Could you show me
a side view of your face?

492
00:26:22,148 --> 00:26:23,149
It looks pretty this way.

493
00:26:23,216 --> 00:26:26,252
Yes, the reflected light from the side...

494
00:26:26,319 --> 00:26:28,088
The body makeup looks beautiful.

495
00:26:28,455 --> 00:26:30,657
It's very detailed and well-done.

496
00:26:31,458 --> 00:26:33,727
I really enjoyed it a lot

497
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:37,997
as it captures the artist's style, taste,
and various know-hows.

498
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:39,799
It was very interesting.

499
00:26:40,200 --> 00:26:43,903
I think this mermaid perfectly captures
the gorgeous, sparkling,

500
00:26:43,970 --> 00:26:47,874
and beautiful color combinations
of Beauty Heiress.

501
00:26:47,941 --> 00:26:51,411
I bet she's from a rich family
in the deep sea.

502
00:26:51,544 --> 00:26:53,446
She looks rich, right?

503
00:26:53,513 --> 00:26:55,615
- I really liked it. Thank you.
- Thank you.

504
00:26:55,682 --> 00:26:58,551
All right. Next is Swag Maker's work.

505
00:27:00,220 --> 00:27:01,254
Oh, my...

506
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:03,123
She has her own unique colors.

507
00:27:03,456 --> 00:27:05,759
Swag Maker's own colors.

508
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:09,529
The theme of this makeup

509
00:27:09,596 --> 00:27:11,331
is "<i>Eomeong</i> Mermaid,"
or a mother mermaid from Jeju.

510
00:27:11,398 --> 00:27:16,002
I'm from Jeju Island,
and my mother lives there,

511
00:27:16,069 --> 00:27:20,640
so I thought working on a model
my mother's age

512
00:27:20,707 --> 00:27:25,745
would allow me to explore
a variety of expressions.

513
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:28,882
I imagined a mermaid mother

514
00:27:28,948 --> 00:27:32,318
<i>to have stuff like deep-sea coral reefs</i>
<i>or mineral substances</i>

515
00:27:32,385 --> 00:27:35,188
<i>covering her face like moss.</i>

516
00:27:35,789 --> 00:27:38,391
<i>I dissolved gelatin powder in hot water,</i>

517
00:27:38,458 --> 00:27:40,560
<i>poured it over her hair,</i>

518
00:27:40,627 --> 00:27:42,462
<i>and let it harden.</i>

519
00:27:42,529 --> 00:27:45,865
<i>I tried to create</i>
<i>the feel of jellyfish tentacles,</i>

520
00:27:45,932 --> 00:27:48,401
<i>as if seawater had</i>
<i>just flowed down her face.</i>

521
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,074
This hairstyle makes her look like

522
00:27:54,140 --> 00:27:56,943
- she really just came out of the water.
- Right, as if she just emerged.

523
00:27:57,110 --> 00:27:58,778
- She seems frantic with worry.
- And she looks...

524
00:27:58,845 --> 00:28:01,214
- She looks a bit cold.
- Yes, she looks cold.

525
00:28:01,281 --> 00:28:03,917
The model's face captures

526
00:28:03,983 --> 00:28:06,953
so many different feelings,

527
00:28:07,020 --> 00:28:08,922
so it makes my heart ache.

528
00:28:08,988 --> 00:28:11,691
I heard that the Korean word "beautiful"

529
00:28:12,492 --> 00:28:15,028
means "true to oneself."

530
00:28:15,395 --> 00:28:19,332
You created a truly beautiful mermaid.
A real mermaid.

531
00:28:19,966 --> 00:28:21,134
Thank you.

532
00:28:23,236 --> 00:28:26,906
Makeup Trendsetter,
please come forward with your model.

533
00:28:34,381 --> 00:28:36,182
<i>This is the last round.</i>

534
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:39,686
<i>So I want to show off the best skin glow.</i>

535
00:28:39,819 --> 00:28:42,255
<i>I will show them a new glow</i>

536
00:28:42,322 --> 00:28:44,724
<i>that the other contestants can't create.</i>

537
00:28:45,258 --> 00:28:47,093
This is Makeup Trendsetter's work.

538
00:28:52,332 --> 00:28:53,566
The skin is crazy.

539
00:28:53,867 --> 00:28:55,335
The texture is gorgeous.

540
00:28:56,236 --> 00:28:59,105
The mother is really pretty.

541
00:29:00,340 --> 00:29:04,711
When I read <i>Mermaid Hunt,</i>

542
00:29:04,911 --> 00:29:09,315
I wanted the mermaid
to be mysterious and beautiful.

543
00:29:09,482 --> 00:29:12,152
So, with the tight and smooth skin,

544
00:29:12,218 --> 00:29:14,287
I tried to give the impression
that mermaids don't age.

545
00:29:14,354 --> 00:29:18,024
I used a mixture of opal pearl powder
and a peel-off mask.

546
00:29:19,893 --> 00:29:22,862
<i>After it dried, I repeated the layering.</i>

547
00:29:22,929 --> 00:29:24,531
<i>I wanted to create</i>
<i>an extremely intense glow.</i>

548
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:29,436
<i>I imagined that perhaps the mother mermaid</i>
<i>would radiate a continuous glow,</i>

549
00:29:29,502 --> 00:29:34,274
<i>even in the deep sea,</i>
<i>to protect her child.</i>

550
00:29:35,508 --> 00:29:37,877
The face itself is like a pearl.

551
00:29:41,348 --> 00:29:43,450
It doesn't look real.

552
00:29:43,516 --> 00:29:45,885
It doesn't look real at all.

553
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:49,189
She doesn't look like a mother.

554
00:29:49,389 --> 00:29:50,790
Her skin looks too young.

555
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:52,659
Mermaids don't age.

556
00:29:52,726 --> 00:29:54,728
- Exactly.
- I wish I were a mermaid.

557
00:29:56,596 --> 00:30:00,734
Did you give the neck and body
a slightly glossy look?

558
00:30:00,800 --> 00:30:03,336
Yes. I thought the mother,
always living underwater,

559
00:30:03,403 --> 00:30:05,705
<i>would have the dewy glitter</i>

560
00:30:05,772 --> 00:30:08,675
and all the pretty things in the sea.

561
00:30:08,742 --> 00:30:10,477
I thought that's how a mermaid would look.

562
00:30:10,543 --> 00:30:12,879
So I used pearly products.

563
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,416
Her neck seems particularly moist.

564
00:30:16,616 --> 00:30:18,685
- Like gills.
- The neck, yes.

565
00:30:18,752 --> 00:30:20,987
<i>On the neck, I also used...</i>

566
00:30:22,055 --> 00:30:24,824
It looks like her neck is palpitating
as she breathes.

567
00:30:26,659 --> 00:30:30,096
Makeup Trendsetter's mermaid

568
00:30:30,163 --> 00:30:34,701
seems like an image from a novel.
It doesn't look real.

569
00:30:34,768 --> 00:30:37,604
It feels like
when she looks for her child,

570
00:30:37,671 --> 00:30:40,707
she would instinctively find
her child immediately.

571
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:44,177
I was amazed
by the mystical expression of her skin.

572
00:30:44,244 --> 00:30:47,881
I don't think a mermaid like her
would cry or run around.

573
00:30:47,947 --> 00:30:51,184
It feels like she would spread her glow
to find her baby.

574
00:30:51,251 --> 00:30:52,585
I bet she would move incredibly fast.

575
00:30:52,652 --> 00:30:54,187
- So fast that you can't even see her.
- Right.

576
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:56,322
It feels like she'd move really fast.

577
00:30:56,389 --> 00:30:59,192
She has some colors on her neck too.

578
00:30:59,259 --> 00:31:01,327
It sparkles in the light,

579
00:31:01,394 --> 00:31:04,898
giving the impression
that her gills are pulsing.

580
00:31:04,964 --> 00:31:07,567
I had a similar thought.

581
00:31:08,001 --> 00:31:10,337
We shine brightly

582
00:31:10,403 --> 00:31:13,807
because we receive love from others,
shining with their light.

583
00:31:14,040 --> 00:31:16,176
But there's one person who doesn't.

584
00:31:16,242 --> 00:31:17,877
It's a mother.

585
00:31:18,078 --> 00:31:19,779
I think you've accurately interpreted

586
00:31:19,846 --> 00:31:22,682
and depicted a motherly figure

587
00:31:22,982 --> 00:31:26,386
who shines with her own light,
making us all shine.

588
00:31:26,453 --> 00:31:28,421
I think you've literally embodied

589
00:31:28,488 --> 00:31:31,925
the mother mermaid with your makeup.

590
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:32,859
Thank you.

591
00:31:32,926 --> 00:31:35,428
Thank you, Makeup Trendsetter.

592
00:31:42,969 --> 00:31:45,138
If you think about it,

593
00:31:45,205 --> 00:31:47,607
she's really like a mermaid whose skin has
become so pale and transparent,

594
00:31:47,674 --> 00:31:50,543
having lived in the deep sea
without any light.

595
00:31:50,610 --> 00:31:53,747
It gave me a really mysterious feeling.

596
00:31:54,314 --> 00:31:56,616
Lastly, Oh Dolce Vita,

597
00:31:56,683 --> 00:31:59,552
please come forward with your model.

598
00:32:07,894 --> 00:32:09,929
This is Oh Dolce Vita's work.

599
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:15,835
It's beautiful.

600
00:32:16,302 --> 00:32:18,538
<i>What? A black mermaid?</i>

601
00:32:19,706 --> 00:32:22,909
<i>If I were her,</i>
<i>I would never have tried black.</i>

602
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:32,485
You have seen many beautiful mermaids

603
00:32:32,819 --> 00:32:34,454
with fair and transparent skin.

604
00:32:34,521 --> 00:32:39,025
This is my mermaid, a black siren,
for the grand finale.

605
00:32:39,592 --> 00:32:42,095
For the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd missions,

606
00:32:42,162 --> 00:32:45,031
I tried to stray
from the typical expectations

607
00:32:45,098 --> 00:32:46,499
that people had.

608
00:32:47,200 --> 00:32:48,802
<i>The key point</i>
<i>of my High Fashion mission makeup</i>

609
00:32:48,868 --> 00:32:51,137
<i>was to avoid using any red colors.</i>

610
00:32:51,438 --> 00:32:52,405
MISSION 2: PAINTING

611
00:32:52,472 --> 00:32:56,910
<i>I tried to portray</i>
<i>the intensity of Ka-madhenu on my mother.</i>

612
00:32:57,344 --> 00:33:00,146
MISSION 3: NOVEL
<i>And when I looked around,</i>

613
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:02,215
<i>everyone was white, pretty, and bright.</i>

614
00:33:02,282 --> 00:33:05,251
<i>But honestly, I didn't think</i>
<i>of a mermaid like that.</i>

615
00:33:05,318 --> 00:33:09,289
This is a fantasy novel,
but it is a story about human desire.

616
00:33:09,556 --> 00:33:11,591
<i>The destruction caused by desire</i>

617
00:33:11,658 --> 00:33:13,693
<i>and the sadness</i>
<i>that comes from that destruction.</i>

618
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,365
<i>The phrase seems to portray</i>
<i>a beautiful mother mermaid,</i>

619
00:33:18,431 --> 00:33:20,600
but I thought the underlying image

620
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:24,170
might be a sad and angry mermaid.

621
00:33:24,237 --> 00:33:27,073
It is a warning about the destruction
caused by human desire

622
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:29,075
<i>and its destructive power.</i>

623
00:33:29,209 --> 00:33:30,977
<i>I wanted to depict a mermaid</i>

624
00:33:31,044 --> 00:33:33,580
<i>that would embody the emotions</i>
<i>felt in the book.</i>

625
00:33:34,314 --> 00:33:38,218
<i>The most important thing is the message</i>
<i>conveyed by the eyes.</i>

626
00:33:39,819 --> 00:33:41,921
<i>I created the shape</i>

627
00:33:41,988 --> 00:33:44,557
<i>with a feeling of sadness and fear.</i>

628
00:33:45,392 --> 00:33:47,560
A mother who is outraged
after losing her child.

629
00:33:47,627 --> 00:33:49,496
- That's what I want to portray.
- I see.

630
00:33:49,629 --> 00:33:52,465
She has lost something precious.

631
00:33:52,832 --> 00:33:56,469
<i>I want to display the sorrow</i>
<i>that the mermaid is feeling.</i>

632
00:33:57,470 --> 00:34:01,808
I created my mermaid
thinking that she was a spiritual being

633
00:34:01,875 --> 00:34:04,411
who could judge and punish us.

634
00:34:04,577 --> 00:34:06,780
That's how I came up with my makeup look.

635
00:34:08,948 --> 00:34:10,183
The smoky eye is amazing.

636
00:34:10,250 --> 00:34:12,452
Not many people can apply eye makeup

637
00:34:12,519 --> 00:34:15,655
by properly lining the eyelids like that.

638
00:34:15,722 --> 00:34:17,090
What kind of color is that?

639
00:34:17,590 --> 00:34:18,725
I bet it's NARS.

640
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,495
How can the eyes have such colors?

641
00:34:22,562 --> 00:34:24,297
- They look really mysterious.
- Right.

642
00:34:25,598 --> 00:34:28,568
This is so beautiful. It's gorgeous.

643
00:34:28,635 --> 00:34:29,636
It's stunning.

644
00:34:29,703 --> 00:34:31,338
It's sorrowfully beautiful.

645
00:34:31,738 --> 00:34:35,041
What are those
particularly sparkly objects?

646
00:34:35,108 --> 00:34:38,912
I used small decorations
that look like jewels.

647
00:34:38,978 --> 00:34:40,647
And they glitter a lot.

648
00:34:40,714 --> 00:34:43,650
And between them,
I added some water droplets

649
00:34:43,717 --> 00:34:46,386
<i>to make her look like</i>
<i>she's shedding tears.</i>

650
00:34:47,921 --> 00:34:51,624
It's fun to see that everyone has
different skills that they excel at.

651
00:34:51,958 --> 00:34:54,327
Her makeup blending is no joke.

652
00:34:54,394 --> 00:34:57,163
The symmetry and blending are flawless.

653
00:34:57,230 --> 00:34:58,998
It's as if it were drawn with a ruler.

654
00:34:59,065 --> 00:35:02,602
When you first started
lining the eyelids with black,

655
00:35:02,669 --> 00:35:04,871
I wondered how you'd manage it.

656
00:35:04,938 --> 00:35:08,274
While the other contestants
were using white or silver,

657
00:35:08,341 --> 00:35:11,044
you were taking a different path.

658
00:35:11,111 --> 00:35:14,614
I was excited and worried watching it.

659
00:35:14,681 --> 00:35:16,816
Now that I've seen the final result,

660
00:35:16,883 --> 00:35:19,085
I can clearly see your determination

661
00:35:19,152 --> 00:35:21,221
to showcase your skills

662
00:35:21,287 --> 00:35:23,356
by minimizing the use

663
00:35:23,423 --> 00:35:25,492
of colors and objects.

664
00:35:25,558 --> 00:35:27,227
<i>The perfect symmetry</i>

665
00:35:27,293 --> 00:35:29,963
<i>and the gradation of monotonous colors.</i>

666
00:35:30,030 --> 00:35:34,601
I think I got to witness
a perfect gradation.

667
00:35:34,668 --> 00:35:37,937
I think your techniques,
skills, and know-how

668
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:39,673
are fully reflected

669
00:35:39,739 --> 00:35:44,210
in this look for the last mission.

670
00:35:44,277 --> 00:35:46,579
I enjoyed it a lot.

671
00:35:46,646 --> 00:35:47,647
Thank you.

672
00:35:48,448 --> 00:35:52,252
How can her eyes be so beautiful?

673
00:35:52,786 --> 00:35:54,788
They look like the ocean.

674
00:35:54,888 --> 00:35:58,291
It's a truly unique and powerful image.

675
00:35:58,558 --> 00:36:01,494
When you write, your work is complete

676
00:36:01,561 --> 00:36:05,331
by thinking about what to remove
rather than what to add.

677
00:36:05,498 --> 00:36:09,169
You, too, seem to have created
this unique work

678
00:36:09,536 --> 00:36:11,671
through meticulous selection and focus.

679
00:36:11,738 --> 00:36:12,639
Thank you.

680
00:36:14,774 --> 00:36:17,711
Your mermaid is a powerful one,

681
00:36:17,977 --> 00:36:21,147
as if she'd demand that the people

682
00:36:22,415 --> 00:36:24,451
bring her child to her right away,

683
00:36:24,517 --> 00:36:26,820
rather than wandering around
searching for them.

684
00:36:26,886 --> 00:36:28,922
Thank you for your hard work.

685
00:36:30,056 --> 00:36:31,257
It's unique.

686
00:36:32,359 --> 00:36:33,293
Very unique.

687
00:36:38,031 --> 00:36:39,232
Now is our time.

688
00:36:42,268 --> 00:36:43,570
It is a difficult time.

689
00:36:43,636 --> 00:36:45,105
This makes no sense.

690
00:36:46,940 --> 00:36:51,177
MISSION 3: NOVEL
JUDGING OVER

691
00:36:51,244 --> 00:36:53,246
Let's show our choices on three.

692
00:36:53,313 --> 00:36:54,914
- Yes, on three.
- Okay.

693
00:36:54,981 --> 00:36:57,017
You were able to narrow it down to three?

694
00:36:57,083 --> 00:36:58,618
- Yes.
- I still have four.

695
00:36:58,685 --> 00:37:00,687
- Really?
- Then go with four.

696
00:37:00,754 --> 00:37:02,756
- All right. One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

697
00:37:02,822 --> 00:37:04,290
- One, two, three.
- One, two, three.

698
00:37:07,260 --> 00:37:08,762
My goodness. This is driving me crazy.

699
00:37:08,828 --> 00:37:10,063
Opinions are mixed again.

700
00:37:10,130 --> 00:37:11,765
I really liked this contestant.

701
00:37:11,998 --> 00:37:14,734
The story was good,

702
00:37:14,801 --> 00:37:17,971
- It wasn't perfect?
- but I don't think

703
00:37:18,038 --> 00:37:19,873
it was good enough

704
00:37:19,939 --> 00:37:22,475
to show the makeup skills.

705
00:37:22,542 --> 00:37:24,444
- I agree with her.
- If we go with this...

706
00:37:24,511 --> 00:37:26,312
That's why I chose this contestant.

707
00:37:26,379 --> 00:37:27,981
It was beautiful,

708
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:30,917
but I didn't feel any emotions
from the work.

709
00:37:31,618 --> 00:37:33,286
I'm too sad to let this go.

710
00:37:35,789 --> 00:37:37,657
Thank you all for your hard work.

711
00:37:41,061 --> 00:37:42,862
Now we have

712
00:37:43,263 --> 00:37:46,433
only a single seat left for the top three.

713
00:37:47,000 --> 00:37:50,570
I wonder who will end up taking the seat.

714
00:37:50,637 --> 00:37:51,905
Makeup Trendsetter,

715
00:37:51,971 --> 00:37:56,242
is there anyone you expect
to take the seat?

716
00:37:57,711 --> 00:38:02,182
Everyone did a great job
with their own unique personalities

717
00:38:02,315 --> 00:38:04,384
and their own interpretations,

718
00:38:04,451 --> 00:38:07,153
so I really don't know.
Can't I just be a candidate?

719
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:11,157
Makeup Trendsetter wants her mermaid

720
00:38:11,224 --> 00:38:13,626
to be one of the candidates here.

721
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:15,161
First Man,

722
00:38:15,228 --> 00:38:17,564
can you tell us your resolve?

723
00:38:17,630 --> 00:38:19,733
I guess you've shared your resolve with us
a lot recently.

724
00:38:19,899 --> 00:38:22,235
I mean, the results
have already been decided.

725
00:38:24,437 --> 00:38:27,140
So I'm thinking I should manage
my facial expressions well.

726
00:38:27,207 --> 00:38:28,742
How wise of you.

727
00:38:29,476 --> 00:38:32,412
We will now reveal the three candidates

728
00:38:32,479 --> 00:38:34,314
for the winner of the Novel mission.

729
00:38:35,148 --> 00:38:39,085
The Novel mission of New Face.
The candidate for the final is...

730
00:38:40,120 --> 00:38:41,888
Oh Dolce Vita.

731
00:38:41,955 --> 00:38:44,457
Oh Dolce Vita. Congratulations.

732
00:38:44,524 --> 00:38:46,760
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF NOVEL
OH DOLCE VITA

733
00:38:48,194 --> 00:38:50,397
<i>Oh Dolce Vita</i>

734
00:38:50,463 --> 00:38:53,166
<i>did an incredible job with her eye makeup.</i>

735
00:38:53,800 --> 00:38:56,036
<i>How could she express</i>

736
00:38:56,102 --> 00:38:59,773
<i>such impactful gradations</i>
<i>with those deep navy colors?</i>

737
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,643
<i>Her new look of a mermaid</i>
<i>was truly unique.</i>

738
00:39:04,544 --> 00:39:05,879
<i>The second candidate is</i>

739
00:39:06,746 --> 00:39:09,315
Makeup Model Student. Congratulations.

740
00:39:09,382 --> 00:39:12,652
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF NOVEL
MAKEUP MODEL STUDENT

741
00:39:13,219 --> 00:39:15,755
<i>Makeup Model Student's mermaid</i>

742
00:39:15,822 --> 00:39:17,323
<i>was pretty and yet sad.</i>

743
00:39:17,991 --> 00:39:21,661
<i>Her big eyes were slightly covered</i>
<i>by white eyelashes,</i>

744
00:39:21,728 --> 00:39:25,732
<i>as if she were hiding her emotions.</i>

745
00:39:25,799 --> 00:39:29,703
<i>And as I looked at the pieces</i>
<i>attached around her lips,</i>

746
00:39:29,769 --> 00:39:32,172
<i>I thought there was a resonance</i>

747
00:39:32,238 --> 00:39:34,908
<i>that touched my heart.</i>

748
00:39:35,041 --> 00:39:36,843
<i>The third candidate is</i>

749
00:39:37,277 --> 00:39:39,412
First Man. Congratulations.

750
00:39:39,479 --> 00:39:42,582
THE TOP CANDIDATE OF NOVEL
FIRST MAN

751
00:39:43,950 --> 00:39:46,286
<i>First Man's mermaid made me feel like</i>

752
00:39:46,386 --> 00:39:48,154
<i>I was seeing something I shouldn't have.</i>

753
00:39:49,155 --> 00:39:52,859
<i>I think he has played to his strengths,</i>

754
00:39:52,926 --> 00:39:54,561
<i>with his bold use of colors.</i>

755
00:39:54,627 --> 00:39:56,363
<i>How did he do that?</i>

756
00:39:56,429 --> 00:39:59,099
<i>It is truly a new face.</i>

757
00:39:59,366 --> 00:40:02,168
Unfortunately, the other contestants
who haven't been called

758
00:40:02,235 --> 00:40:05,705
have already been eliminated.

759
00:40:06,373 --> 00:40:09,142
Now, which of these three

760
00:40:09,209 --> 00:40:11,778
will advance to the finals?

761
00:40:12,178 --> 00:40:14,614
We will announce the result.

762
00:40:17,417 --> 00:40:21,021
The contestant to advance
to the finals is...

763
00:40:22,822 --> 00:40:25,625
<i>Now that I've come this far,</i>
<i>I want to advance to the finals.</i>

764
00:40:26,426 --> 00:40:28,995
<i>I think I'll be the winner of Round Three.</i>

765
00:40:30,130 --> 00:40:32,098
<i>It couldn't be me, right?</i>

766
00:40:35,101 --> 00:40:36,269
I'm so nervous.

767
00:40:37,637 --> 00:40:38,738
My heart can't take this.

768
00:40:42,909 --> 00:40:45,679
The last contestant to make the top three.

769
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:47,981
Drumroll.

770
00:40:48,048 --> 00:40:48,915
The winner is...

771
00:40:50,250 --> 00:40:51,351
I'm so nervous.

772
00:40:52,318 --> 00:40:53,286
The winner is...

773
00:40:54,587 --> 00:40:56,289
Oh Dolce Vita.

774
00:40:56,356 --> 00:40:58,692
Oh Dolce Vita. Congratulations.

775
00:40:58,758 --> 00:41:01,761
THE LAST OF THE TOP 3
OH DOLCE VITA

776
00:41:01,828 --> 00:41:02,962
What do I do?

777
00:41:04,631 --> 00:41:07,167
Oh Dolce Vita. Congratulations.

778
00:41:10,770 --> 00:41:13,873
The last contestant to make the top three

779
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:16,176
is Oh Dolce Vita.

780
00:41:16,943 --> 00:41:20,413
Her sensitivity and skills
were all excellent.

781
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,149
It was perfect and beautiful.

782
00:41:23,216 --> 00:41:25,618
The story was also reinterpreted
in a unique way.

783
00:41:25,685 --> 00:41:27,487
If you think of the overall quality...

784
00:41:27,554 --> 00:41:29,456
Right. It was of high quality.

785
00:41:29,522 --> 00:41:31,491
She should make it to the finals.

786
00:41:32,058 --> 00:41:34,894
What we prioritised the most
was a new face.

787
00:41:35,862 --> 00:41:40,033
<i>I was already surprised from the moment</i>
<i>she appeared with a black dress.</i>

788
00:41:40,100 --> 00:41:42,869
<i>She ventured beyond</i>
<i>our typical expectations.</i>

789
00:41:42,936 --> 00:41:44,938
<i>Among the eight mermaids,</i>

790
00:41:45,005 --> 00:41:47,707
<i>she really stood out alone.</i>

791
00:41:48,108 --> 00:41:52,779
I think we were drawn to the darkness
because it wasn't just cool.

792
00:41:52,979 --> 00:41:56,116
<i>The darkness showed a reflection</i>
<i>of her deep understanding</i>

793
00:41:56,182 --> 00:41:59,119
<i>and empathy for Mermaid Hunt.</i>

794
00:41:59,185 --> 00:42:00,587
<i>That's why we were drawn to the look.</i>

795
00:42:00,653 --> 00:42:05,458
<i>In terms of technique, it wasn't just</i>
<i>smoky makeup with black liners.</i>

796
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:09,929
<i>She was truly meticulous.</i>
<i>Not a single smudge was out of place.</i>

797
00:42:09,996 --> 00:42:11,898
<i>It was perfectly executed.</i>

798
00:42:12,265 --> 00:42:16,102
<i>The area covered by the eyeshadow</i>

799
00:42:16,169 --> 00:42:20,807
<i>was perfectly proportioned</i>
<i>to complement the model,</i>

800
00:42:20,874 --> 00:42:24,811
<i>and the overall makeup</i>
<i>was perfectly balanced for her face.</i>

801
00:42:25,111 --> 00:42:26,946
I think NARS should give her an award.

802
00:42:29,649 --> 00:42:32,018
To be honest, I didn't expect to win.

803
00:42:32,085 --> 00:42:36,723
I thought that since the mermaid look
would be the last mission for today,

804
00:42:37,223 --> 00:42:43,229
I wanted to show something
that I was the best at.

805
00:42:44,197 --> 00:42:46,232
I'm grateful that you appreciated it.

806
00:42:49,002 --> 00:42:51,004
Oh Dolce Vita, please come forward

807
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,839
- and receive the brush.
- Congratulations.

808
00:42:52,906 --> 00:42:54,140
- Thank you.
- You may go

809
00:42:54,207 --> 00:42:56,276
- to the seats for the finalists.
- Congratulations.

810
00:42:56,343 --> 00:42:57,377
Congratulations.

811
00:43:01,281 --> 00:43:03,483
Congratulations.

812
00:43:03,550 --> 00:43:05,051
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

813
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:06,619
Please go up.

814
00:43:10,223 --> 00:43:11,257
Oh, dear.

815
00:43:11,324 --> 00:43:13,059
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

816
00:43:13,126 --> 00:43:14,060
Congratulations.

817
00:43:16,229 --> 00:43:17,163
This is quite pricey.

818
00:43:18,832 --> 00:43:19,899
Thank you.

819
00:43:21,234 --> 00:43:22,936
It was really beautiful.

820
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:24,204
<i>I want to be the final winner.</i>

821
00:43:24,270 --> 00:43:25,438
Just go for it.

822
00:43:25,505 --> 00:43:26,906
I want to win.

823
00:43:27,207 --> 00:43:30,343
We'd also like to express our gratitude
to Novelist Cha In-pyo,

824
00:43:30,410 --> 00:43:33,013
who joined us
for the Novel mission of New Face.

825
00:43:33,079 --> 00:43:35,715
Please share with us
how you were feeling here today.

826
00:43:35,782 --> 00:43:38,752
It was a true honor to be part
of such a wonderful event.

827
00:43:39,152 --> 00:43:40,954
Each and every one of you

828
00:43:41,021 --> 00:43:43,556
is a professional makeup artist.

829
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:45,892
And yet,

830
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:48,428
your courage to participate
in a survival show

831
00:43:48,795 --> 00:43:51,431
where only professionals compete
is truly admirable.

832
00:43:51,731 --> 00:43:53,299
If someone asked me

833
00:43:53,366 --> 00:43:57,671
to participate in a survival show
where professional actors compete,

834
00:43:57,737 --> 00:43:58,905
I don't think I could do that.

835
00:43:59,572 --> 00:44:02,575
I consider you all winners

836
00:44:02,776 --> 00:44:06,312
simply for participating
and challenging yourself.

837
00:44:06,513 --> 00:44:08,181
I believe your worth

838
00:44:08,248 --> 00:44:11,151
has already been proven
not by the results, but by the process.

839
00:44:11,217 --> 00:44:13,520
I cheer on every one of you. Thank you.

840
00:44:19,259 --> 00:44:23,396
The seven contestants who unfortunately
didn't make it to the finals.

841
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:27,500
I'd like to thank you all
for trying your best until the semifinals.

842
00:44:27,567 --> 00:44:29,736
Now, I hope you all return
to your respective positions

843
00:44:29,803 --> 00:44:31,604
and continue to do

844
00:44:31,671 --> 00:44:35,241
the wonderful and passionate work
you have been doing so far.

845
00:44:35,675 --> 00:44:37,744
Thank you, everyone.

846
00:44:37,977 --> 00:44:40,180
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

847
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:46,820
SEMIFINALS
NEW FACE IS OVER

848
00:45:13,279 --> 00:45:14,981
Look at all these brushes.

849
00:45:15,949 --> 00:45:18,518
<i>I could've been in that position.</i>

850
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:21,488
<i>My brush could've been there too.</i>

851
00:45:21,554 --> 00:45:23,356
<i>So as I walked through the place,</i>

852
00:45:23,456 --> 00:45:25,859
<i>I had strongly mixed feelings.</i>

853
00:45:26,693 --> 00:45:29,229
<i>I didn't know I'd make it this far.</i>

854
00:45:29,596 --> 00:45:31,231
<i>The die has already been cast.</i>

855
00:45:31,297 --> 00:45:33,033
<i>I just need to do my best</i>

856
00:45:33,233 --> 00:45:35,335
<i>so I won't embarrass myself. That's all.</i>

857
00:45:37,103 --> 00:45:39,372
<i>I just wanted to do some makeup.</i>

858
00:45:39,439 --> 00:45:42,242
<i>It was a time</i>
<i>when I had that thought a lot.</i>

859
00:45:42,475 --> 00:45:46,646
<i>I'll just do some makeup like crazy</i>
<i>and have a blast before I leave.</i>

860
00:45:52,786 --> 00:45:55,288
Sincere congratulations
to the top three candidates

861
00:45:55,355 --> 00:45:57,123
who advanced to the final round.

862
00:45:58,925 --> 00:46:00,293
Golden Hand in Paris.

863
00:46:00,360 --> 00:46:02,429
Among the three of you,
who do you think will win?

864
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:06,733
Now that I'm here, I really want to win.

865
00:46:07,734 --> 00:46:10,403
Of course. I appreciate your honesty.

866
00:46:10,470 --> 00:46:11,938
You came all the way from Paris.

867
00:46:12,005 --> 00:46:14,874
I'd love to fly business class
at least once.

868
00:46:14,941 --> 00:46:17,377
I hope you win
and fly first class back home.

869
00:46:17,444 --> 00:46:18,712
- Thank you.
- Yes.

870
00:46:18,778 --> 00:46:20,046
Detailed Hands.

871
00:46:22,582 --> 00:46:25,352
I hope I win too.

872
00:46:26,219 --> 00:46:27,654
No one's willing to budge.

873
00:46:27,954 --> 00:46:29,456
Now that I've come this far

874
00:46:29,522 --> 00:46:31,558
and am standing right here,

875
00:46:32,025 --> 00:46:34,561
I do want to win.

876
00:46:34,761 --> 00:46:36,096
Oh Dolce Vita.

877
00:46:37,931 --> 00:46:39,399
I just can't lose.

878
00:46:40,500 --> 00:46:42,369
Did you even consider giving in at first?

879
00:46:42,435 --> 00:46:44,371
I wasn't expecting much,

880
00:46:44,537 --> 00:46:46,406
but listening to what they said,

881
00:46:46,473 --> 00:46:47,774
I just don't want to lose.

882
00:46:49,275 --> 00:46:50,477
You are smiling,

883
00:46:50,543 --> 00:46:54,447
but I can sense your passion inside.

884
00:46:54,781 --> 00:46:59,285
Now, only one mission remains
before deciding on the final winner.

885
00:46:59,619 --> 00:47:02,689
The mission for the final round
of JUST MAKEUP is

886
00:47:02,989 --> 00:47:04,391
Dreams.

887
00:47:07,627 --> 00:47:08,795
Dreams?

888
00:47:08,862 --> 00:47:11,297
It is a mission
where you will complete a photoshoot

889
00:47:11,364 --> 00:47:13,800
that captures the dreams
of the special models.

890
00:47:13,867 --> 00:47:15,168
The final winner's photoshoot

891
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:17,037
<i>will grace the cover of the December issue</i>

892
00:47:17,103 --> 00:47:20,874
of Harper's Bazaar,
the world's first fashion magazine.

893
00:47:21,374 --> 00:47:25,278
<i>It's not the prize money,</i>
<i>but the cover that makes me want it.</i>

894
00:47:25,545 --> 00:47:28,348
<i>This isn't just about a competition.</i>

895
00:47:28,415 --> 00:47:30,083
I thought it would be

896
00:47:30,150 --> 00:47:32,919
incredibly meaningful
to be featured in the media.

897
00:47:32,986 --> 00:47:34,487
<i>I was really excited.</i>

898
00:47:34,554 --> 00:47:38,758
I thought I'd be able to create
another record of my own.

899
00:47:38,825 --> 00:47:39,993
Since this is the final round,

900
00:47:40,060 --> 00:47:43,563
you will be working
with truly special models.

901
00:47:44,798 --> 00:47:48,802
Now, I'll reveal the models
who will be joining you

902
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:51,338
on the final mission.

903
00:47:51,404 --> 00:47:53,606
Please reveal the first model.

904
00:47:53,673 --> 00:47:55,041
REVEALING THE MODELS FOR THE FINAL MISSION

KIM YOUNG-OK

906
00:47:58,678 --> 00:48:00,046
They surprise me every time.

907
00:48:00,113 --> 00:48:01,748
She needs no introduction.

908
00:48:01,815 --> 00:48:03,450
She is Actress Kim Young-ok,

909
00:48:03,516 --> 00:48:05,752
whose natural and powerful acting

910
00:48:05,819 --> 00:48:08,254
resonates deeply with viewers.

911
00:48:08,888 --> 00:48:10,924
Please reveal the second model.

00:48:12,559 --> 00:48:13,993
She is Ban Hyo-joung,

914
00:48:14,060 --> 00:48:15,862
a veteran actress
with over 60 years of experience,

915
00:48:15,929 --> 00:48:18,765
having portrayed a wide range

916
00:48:18,832 --> 00:48:21,134
of characters in over 100 TV shows.

917
00:48:21,301 --> 00:48:23,336
Please reveal the last model.

918
00:48:23,403 --> 00:48:24,571
JUNG HYE-SEON

919
00:48:24,637 --> 00:48:27,273
She is an actress who shows off
her powerful charisma

920
00:48:27,340 --> 00:48:29,642
and confident acting skills
hidden behind a kind smile.

921
00:48:29,709 --> 00:48:31,945
She is Actress Jung Hye-seon.

922
00:48:32,712 --> 00:48:36,282
<i>I felt as if I had been hit on the head.</i>

923
00:48:36,683 --> 00:48:38,184
<i>I never imagined it.</i>

924
00:48:38,251 --> 00:48:41,388
<i>I never imagined I'd be expressing</i>

925
00:48:41,454 --> 00:48:45,025
<i>the dreams of such elderly actors.</i>

926
00:48:45,892 --> 00:48:47,394
<i>As soon as they were revealed,</i>

927
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:50,196
<i>I thought,</i>
<i>"They're really pushing us to our limits."</i>

928
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:52,565
<i>Actually, these models</i>
<i>aren't the easiest to do makeup for.</i>

929
00:48:52,632 --> 00:48:54,367
I should've known
from the moment they brought the twins.

930
00:48:55,635 --> 00:48:58,571
All 3 of them, despite being over 80,

931
00:48:58,638 --> 00:49:02,142
are said to still be dreaming
new dreams about acting.

932
00:49:02,375 --> 00:49:06,112
Using makeup,
you are to complete a special photoshoot

933
00:49:06,179 --> 00:49:10,216
to portray the characters that these three
are dreaming as actresses.

934
00:49:11,117 --> 00:49:12,185
Golden Hand in Paris,

935
00:49:12,252 --> 00:49:14,888
the first contestant
to pass the semifinals,

936
00:49:14,988 --> 00:49:18,925
will be given the benefit
of choosing the model first.

937
00:49:18,992 --> 00:49:21,161
- Can you give me some time to think?
- Sure.

938
00:49:21,227 --> 00:49:22,829
- Please take as much time as you want.
- Okay.

939
00:49:23,897 --> 00:49:25,865
<i>When you do makeup,</i>

940
00:49:25,932 --> 00:49:29,669
<i>every element, such as the model's profile</i>
<i>and when you see them in person,</i>

941
00:49:29,736 --> 00:49:30,704
<i>is important.</i>

942
00:49:33,907 --> 00:49:35,275
I'm feeling at ease.

943
00:49:35,942 --> 00:49:37,877
I'll choose this actress.

944
00:49:37,977 --> 00:49:42,449
Yes. Golden Hand in Paris
has chosen the following actress.

945
00:49:42,515 --> 00:49:44,484
I'll choose this actress.

946
00:49:44,684 --> 00:49:45,952
All right.

947
00:49:46,319 --> 00:49:48,555
So, all three of you
have chosen your models.

948
00:49:48,888 --> 00:49:50,690
The mission, Dreams,
which will make your dreams of winning

949
00:49:50,757 --> 00:49:53,493
and the dreams
of the three actresses come true.

950
00:49:53,860 --> 00:49:57,430
Who among the three of you
will be the final winner?

951
00:49:57,731 --> 00:50:00,633
The top three
who have worked hard for victory,

952
00:50:01,067 --> 00:50:03,436
we will see you in the finals.

953
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:06,873
MEETING WITH THE FINAL MODELS

954
00:50:06,940 --> 00:50:07,907
<i>What do I do?</i>

955
00:50:08,375 --> 00:50:10,276
This is my third cup of coffee.

956
00:50:10,410 --> 00:50:11,378
Oh, dear.

957
00:50:15,248 --> 00:50:16,549
I'm so nervous.

958
00:50:17,250 --> 00:50:19,686
My heart is pounding. What do I do?

959
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:26,259
Hello.

960
00:50:26,326 --> 00:50:27,827
Hello.

961
00:50:28,528 --> 00:50:29,496
Hello.

962
00:50:29,562 --> 00:50:30,864
Hello.

963
00:50:31,398 --> 00:50:33,166
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

964
00:50:33,233 --> 00:50:34,467
KIM YOUNG-OK AND DETAILED HANDS
How are you?

965
00:50:34,534 --> 00:50:36,703
- You look beautiful and sophisticated.
- Oh, please.

966
00:50:36,770 --> 00:50:37,837
Thank you.

967
00:50:38,138 --> 00:50:41,608
- I'm sorry that I look like this.
- No, you look gorgeous.

968
00:50:41,675 --> 00:50:42,609
Oh, stop it.

969
00:50:47,847 --> 00:50:50,316
- Hello.
- Hello.

970
00:50:50,383 --> 00:50:52,686
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

971
00:50:53,019 --> 00:50:54,387
- Is this for me?
- Yes.

972
00:50:54,888 --> 00:50:56,756
Is it okay for me to receive
such beautiful flowers?

973
00:50:56,823 --> 00:50:59,526
- I bought them this morning.
- Thank you.

974
00:50:59,592 --> 00:51:02,495
BAN HYO-JOUNG AND GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS
Nice to meet you.

975
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,965
- Hello.
- Hello.

976
00:51:06,032 --> 00:51:07,967
- Are you the artist?
- Yes.

977
00:51:08,368 --> 00:51:09,869
You do look like you're on another level.

978
00:51:10,904 --> 00:51:13,273
It's an honor to meet you.

979
00:51:13,340 --> 00:51:14,607
JUNG HYE-SEON AND OH DOLCE VITA
Please have a seat.

980
00:51:14,674 --> 00:51:16,676
We can have a talk here.

981
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:21,214
Actually, I can already tell
you have great skin.

982
00:51:21,281 --> 00:51:23,350
I don't even need to touch your face.

983
00:51:23,416 --> 00:51:24,517
- It's so nice.
- You can touch it.

984
00:51:24,584 --> 00:51:25,685
Seriously...

985
00:51:26,119 --> 00:51:27,887
You have such supple skin.

986
00:51:27,954 --> 00:51:29,622
How can it be so supple?

987
00:51:30,490 --> 00:51:32,759
Makeup adheres well
when your skin is supple like this.

988
00:51:32,826 --> 00:51:35,962
In the past, I've tried all kinds
of German and French cosmetics.

989
00:51:36,029 --> 00:51:37,630
That's what we used back then.

990
00:51:37,697 --> 00:51:40,734
But ever since
Korean-made cosmetics came out,

991
00:51:40,800 --> 00:51:42,202
I haven't used any of those.

992
00:51:42,268 --> 00:51:43,837
- I see.
- I only use domestic products.

993
00:51:43,903 --> 00:51:46,406
- I think it's thanks to that.
- I see.

994
00:51:46,473 --> 00:51:49,175
We should use domestic products.

995
00:51:50,744 --> 00:51:51,678
Domestic products?

996
00:51:51,745 --> 00:51:53,079
OH DOLCE VITA
ARTIST FOR NARS, AN AMERICAN BRAND

997
00:51:53,146 --> 00:51:54,714
She works for a foreign brand.

998
00:51:56,116 --> 00:51:58,385
I'm sorry, but I work for a foreign brand.

999
00:51:59,686 --> 00:52:01,855
- I see.
- Yes.

1000
00:52:01,921 --> 00:52:04,491
I recently bought a domestic car.

1001
00:52:04,557 --> 00:52:05,525
I see.

1002
00:52:05,592 --> 00:52:07,460
- Now that I'm going to die soon...
- Domestic cars are good.

1003
00:52:08,128 --> 00:52:09,629
- You should reflect on yourself.
- Okay.

1004
00:52:11,431 --> 00:52:13,733
Your pupils are unusually big.

1005
00:52:13,800 --> 00:52:16,069
- They are?
- Yes. And your pupils have

1006
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:17,137
such a mysterious color.

1007
00:52:17,203 --> 00:52:19,205
I even wondered
if you were wearing contact lenses.

1008
00:52:19,539 --> 00:52:20,907
Good observation.

1009
00:52:20,974 --> 00:52:21,908
The thing is,

1010
00:52:22,709 --> 00:52:25,879
I had cataract surgery 3 or 4 months ago.

1011
00:52:27,180 --> 00:52:29,683
My real eye color is gone.

1012
00:52:30,917 --> 00:52:32,052
So that was a good observation.

1013
00:52:32,118 --> 00:52:33,453
I didn't know that.

1014
00:52:34,954 --> 00:52:37,357
Ms. Kim, if you don't mind,

1015
00:52:37,424 --> 00:52:39,192
may I take a look

1016
00:52:39,259 --> 00:52:41,327
- at your makeup pouch?
- I have it here.

1017
00:52:41,394 --> 00:52:42,495
This is...

1018
00:52:42,762 --> 00:52:44,898
- This is just...
- I'm really curious.

1019
00:52:44,964 --> 00:52:47,767
These are the things
I carry around for quick use.

1020
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:50,003
My goodness, a mirror
with Lim Young-woong's face on it.

1021
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,372
This just had to be the first one.

1022
00:52:53,473 --> 00:52:54,708
I'm sorry.

1023
00:52:54,774 --> 00:52:58,378
Seeing this face makes me feel good.

1024
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:00,347
It's fun to look at this.

1025
00:53:00,413 --> 00:53:01,414
Do you wear mascara?

1026
00:53:01,481 --> 00:53:02,515
Just a little.

1027
00:53:02,582 --> 00:53:05,018
I don't have many eyelashes, though.

1028
00:53:05,085 --> 00:53:08,321
- My eyelashes are just a bit thin.
- I see.

1029
00:53:08,388 --> 00:53:11,958
With some mascara here,
my eyes look a little livelier.

1030
00:53:12,025 --> 00:53:12,992
I started wearing it recently.

1031
00:53:13,059 --> 00:53:14,294
- I didn't before.
- I'm a makeup artist,

1032
00:53:14,361 --> 00:53:15,829
but wearing mascara
is too much of a hassle.

1033
00:53:15,895 --> 00:53:18,198
- Removing it is too much work.
- Right.

1034
00:53:18,264 --> 00:53:19,432
It gets sooty when you remove it.

1035
00:53:19,499 --> 00:53:22,469
So, Ms. Ban, the thing is...

1036
00:53:30,710 --> 00:53:31,911
- I'm...
- Go ahead.

1037
00:53:32,112 --> 00:53:34,881
I'm not very good with words.

1038
00:53:34,948 --> 00:53:36,683
I'm not good with words either.

1039
00:53:37,384 --> 00:53:40,286
That's why I'm not good at variety shows.

1040
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:41,988
- That's why I like you.
- I see.

1041
00:53:42,055 --> 00:53:43,523
- That's why you like me?
- Yes.

1042
00:53:44,758 --> 00:53:47,327
- I didn't see you on many variety shows.
- That's why...

1043
00:53:47,394 --> 00:53:48,928
- You were curious about me?
- Yes.

1044
00:53:48,995 --> 00:53:50,797
Still, I won't talk much today.

1045
00:53:50,864 --> 00:53:52,499
I see. Please take your time.

1046
00:53:53,633 --> 00:53:56,836
So, did you hear about the theme?

1047
00:53:56,903 --> 00:53:58,438
- Yes.
- Dreams.

1048
00:53:59,039 --> 00:54:01,541
I was surprised
when I heard about the theme.

1049
00:54:01,608 --> 00:54:06,079
I wondered what I could possibly do.

1050
00:54:06,179 --> 00:54:09,249
I've been acting for about 60 years,

1051
00:54:09,315 --> 00:54:10,950
- so there's no role that I haven't tried.
- Right.

1052
00:54:11,017 --> 00:54:14,287
But about ten years ago,
I did a TV show called <i>49 Days.</i>

1053
00:54:14,354 --> 00:54:18,124
I played a character
who comes to judge the souls

1054
00:54:18,191 --> 00:54:22,028
who were wandering the underworld,
unable to go up to heaven.

1055
00:54:22,362 --> 00:54:25,031
I rode a motorcycle wearing smoky makeup.

1056
00:54:25,732 --> 00:54:27,367
I'd say, "You punks,

1057
00:54:27,434 --> 00:54:29,169
why are you still here?
Leave immediately."

1058
00:54:29,235 --> 00:54:32,672
It was a brief role,
but it left a deep impression on me.

1059
00:54:32,906 --> 00:54:36,109
So, I'd like to capture it in a photo
if I had a chance.

1060
00:54:36,176 --> 00:54:38,178
So I wanted to ask you to do that.

1061
00:54:38,945 --> 00:54:42,182
- So, do you mean a Grim Reaper?
- Yes.

1062
00:54:43,216 --> 00:54:44,517
Grim Reaper?

1063
00:54:45,418 --> 00:54:46,519
Is it strange?

1064
00:54:46,586 --> 00:54:48,154
No. It's not strange at all.

1065
00:54:48,221 --> 00:54:52,926
Don't I look a bit like one,
with my eyes and all?

1066
00:54:52,992 --> 00:54:54,294
People say I look scary.

1067
00:54:54,361 --> 00:54:56,196
You look scary on TV, to be honest.

1068
00:54:56,262 --> 00:54:59,265
I'm sorry to say this,
but you don't look that way in person.

1069
00:54:59,332 --> 00:55:02,669
I think I have those qualities
inherent in me.

1070
00:55:02,736 --> 00:55:04,304
I think you will look amazing.

1071
00:55:04,371 --> 00:55:06,806
I'm getting so many ideas right now.

1072
00:55:06,873 --> 00:55:08,208
- Thank you.
- Yes.

1073
00:55:08,575 --> 00:55:13,046
<i>She said she'd love to play</i>
<i>the Grim Reaper again, as her dream role.</i>

1074
00:55:13,113 --> 00:55:15,248
<i>So I gave it a lot of thought.</i>

1075
00:55:15,315 --> 00:55:18,118
Ms. Ban received the Achievement Award

1076
00:55:18,184 --> 00:55:21,354
at the 2009 Drama Awards.

1077
00:55:21,421 --> 00:55:25,692
<i>This is what she said</i>
<i>during her acceptance speech.</i>

1078
00:55:26,593 --> 00:55:31,731
"Do not walk recklessly
on a field of snow.

1079
00:55:31,798 --> 00:55:34,200
The footprints you leave behind

1080
00:55:34,267 --> 00:55:37,203
will become a milestone
for those who follow."

1081
00:55:37,470 --> 00:55:39,973
This is what she said,
and when I heard it,

1082
00:55:40,140 --> 00:55:42,142
I was deeply moved.

1083
00:55:42,208 --> 00:55:47,447
The Grim Reaper she wants to portray
and the Grim Reaper that I envision

1084
00:55:47,514 --> 00:55:49,149
are like a guide in a way.

1085
00:55:49,549 --> 00:55:51,618
In this world we live in today,

1086
00:55:51,685 --> 00:55:53,687
she could be a guide
who heals the hearts of people.

1087
00:55:53,753 --> 00:55:56,923
I believe it can also serve as a guide,

1088
00:55:56,990 --> 00:55:59,559
so I chose the Grim Reaper,
the guide of souls,

1089
00:55:59,626 --> 00:56:01,795
as the theme for this mission.

1090
00:56:02,562 --> 00:56:06,900
If I had a chance to try it again,

1091
00:56:06,966 --> 00:56:09,235
I'd like to recreate the look I had

1092
00:56:09,302 --> 00:56:12,005
when I was younger and doing action films.

1093
00:56:12,072 --> 00:56:15,675
That's the look I want to recreate.

1094
00:56:16,109 --> 00:56:16,943
Yes.

1095
00:56:17,043 --> 00:56:19,979
I heard she started her career
as an action star.

1096
00:56:20,046 --> 00:56:23,983
<i>I was surprised</i>
<i>that women could become action stars</i>

1097
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:26,786
<i>in the 1970s like she did.</i>

1098
00:56:26,853 --> 00:56:30,256
<i>I think her spirit of challenge</i>
<i>was truly remarkable.</i>

1099
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:33,893
The theme is <i>Madame Jang from Hong Kong.</i>

1100
00:56:33,960 --> 00:56:36,229
<i>Her character trains</i>
<i>in martial arts in Hong Kong</i>

1101
00:56:36,296 --> 00:56:38,765
<i>and returns to Korea to avenge her family.</i>

1102
00:56:38,832 --> 00:56:40,800
<i>She even shoots guns in the film.</i>

1103
00:56:40,867 --> 00:56:43,903
I'd like to capture the charisma

1104
00:56:43,970 --> 00:56:48,008
and coolness in homage to that.

1105
00:56:48,708 --> 00:56:50,076
Isn't this supposed to be a secret?

1106
00:56:50,143 --> 00:56:51,978
- It is a secret.
- It is, right?

1107
00:56:52,045 --> 00:56:53,713
- If anyone asks,
- No one can know.

1108
00:56:53,780 --> 00:56:56,316
please say, "I'm just doing
what I've always done."

1109
00:56:57,117 --> 00:56:59,152
"I'll just play a dignified role."

1110
00:57:00,286 --> 00:57:01,988
While you do that,

1111
00:57:02,055 --> 00:57:03,923
I'll take care of everything with a kick.

1112
00:57:03,990 --> 00:57:05,558
- Something sensational.
- Yes.

1113
00:57:05,792 --> 00:57:08,194
You've been acting for a long time,
haven't you?

1114
00:57:08,261 --> 00:57:10,830
I may not be that pretty,

1115
00:57:10,897 --> 00:57:13,867
but I wish I'd played roles
appropriate for my age.

1116
00:57:13,933 --> 00:57:16,002
Even when I was around 28,

1117
00:57:16,069 --> 00:57:18,471
- I played grandmothers a lot.
- I know.

1118
00:57:18,538 --> 00:57:20,306
You played a grandmother in your twenties.

1119
00:57:20,373 --> 00:57:23,309
So I've played a lot of grandmother roles,

1120
00:57:23,376 --> 00:57:26,379
and now I'm a real grandmother.

1121
00:57:26,780 --> 00:57:30,617
I play almost all the roles
of senile grandmothers.

1122
00:57:31,151 --> 00:57:32,786
- That's how I've come this far.
- Yes.

1123
00:57:32,852 --> 00:57:35,088
So, do you have a favorite makeup style?

1124
00:57:35,155 --> 00:57:36,523
Or a style you'd like to try?

1125
00:57:37,424 --> 00:57:39,259
Just something simple.

1126
00:57:39,325 --> 00:57:42,629
Can you make me look elegant
with this face?

1127
00:57:42,862 --> 00:57:47,100
If so, I'd like to try a face
like the Queen of England.

1128
00:57:47,167 --> 00:57:48,335
That sounds great.

1129
00:57:48,401 --> 00:57:50,370
I've always liked the Queen of England.

1130
00:57:50,437 --> 00:57:52,072
I've been watching her

1131
00:57:52,138 --> 00:57:54,407
since she ascended the throne
at the age of 26.

1132
00:57:54,474 --> 00:57:59,946
I've always wanted to emulate
someone I admire.

1133
00:58:00,013 --> 00:58:01,047
That would be great.

1134
00:58:01,114 --> 00:58:02,682
It wouldn't look great, though.

1135
00:58:02,749 --> 00:58:04,451
- No, it will look great.
- You think?

1136
00:58:04,517 --> 00:58:08,388
When the Queen wore 3 pearl necklaces,
I also wore 3 necklaces.

1137
00:58:08,455 --> 00:58:10,256
When she wore 2, I also wore 2.

1138
00:58:10,323 --> 00:58:13,193
That's what I'd really like to try.

1139
00:58:13,259 --> 00:58:15,595
All right. You can play with this face.

1140
00:58:16,563 --> 00:58:20,266
I'm excited to see what kind of appearance

1141
00:58:20,333 --> 00:58:21,968
I can pull off.

1142
00:58:22,736 --> 00:58:24,904
<i>I really wanted to do as she said.</i>

1143
00:58:24,971 --> 00:58:27,073
"Can you make me look elegant?"

1144
00:58:27,741 --> 00:58:28,942
That's what she said.

1145
00:58:29,009 --> 00:58:32,145
Those words resonated deeply with me.

1146
00:58:32,212 --> 00:58:35,749
<i>So, I wanted her</i>
<i>to be the Queen for the day.</i>

1147
00:58:36,016 --> 00:58:39,552
<i>I wanted to make her look like</i>
<i>a truly elegant queen.</i>

1148
00:58:39,619 --> 00:58:41,187
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS: GRIM REAPER

1149
00:58:41,254 --> 00:58:42,722
DETAILED HANDS: QUEEN ELIZABETH

1150
00:58:42,789 --> 00:58:44,357
OH DOLCE VITA: ACTION STAR

1151
00:58:47,894 --> 00:58:50,730
A world transformed by makeup,
JUST MAKEUP.

1152
00:58:50,797 --> 00:58:54,834
Today is the day
the final winner will be decided.

1153
00:58:55,835 --> 00:58:59,939
Who will be the winner?

1154
00:59:00,106 --> 00:59:04,077
You all must be very nervous right now.

1155
00:59:04,477 --> 00:59:08,148
As today is the final mission,

1156
00:59:08,214 --> 00:59:11,151
we've prepared another gift
to make your dreams come true.

1157
00:59:11,751 --> 00:59:12,886
Are you curious?

1158
00:59:13,253 --> 00:59:15,488
Please reveal the gift now.

1159
00:59:27,534 --> 00:59:31,538
All the products you need are right here.

1160
00:59:31,604 --> 00:59:34,007
Please choose the products you need
from the pantry

1161
00:59:34,074 --> 00:59:36,776
and set them up individually.

1162
00:59:36,843 --> 00:59:39,212
A PANTRY FILLED WITH AMOREPACIFIC PRODUCTS
They've transferred an entire store.

1163
00:59:39,679 --> 00:59:40,714
Right?

1164
00:59:42,115 --> 00:59:43,350
I love it.

1165
00:59:44,250 --> 00:59:45,352
This is amazing.

1166
00:59:45,418 --> 00:59:47,420
- There are a lot of products.
- My goodness.

1167
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:49,756
There are various colors.

1168
00:59:50,423 --> 00:59:51,591
They're pretty.

1169
00:59:53,026 --> 00:59:54,961
What are these?
They even have things like these?

1170
00:59:55,929 --> 00:59:57,530
This is so cute.

1171
00:59:58,732 --> 01:00:00,233
My goodness.

1172
01:00:00,734 --> 01:00:02,635
Gosh, this is beautiful.

1173
01:00:03,970 --> 01:00:07,741
<i>I wanted the Grim Reaper's colors</i>
<i>to be a bit dreamy.</i>

1174
01:00:07,807 --> 01:00:11,378
<i>So I looked for the colors I needed</i>
<i>with that in mind.</i>

1175
01:00:12,545 --> 01:00:15,148
<i>While testing the shades,</i>

1176
01:00:15,782 --> 01:00:19,652
<i>I found a palette</i>
<i>that had navy and lime green colors.</i>

1177
01:00:19,719 --> 01:00:23,056
<i>And the shimmer was really pretty,</i>
<i>and the gradation was perfect.</i>

1178
01:00:23,123 --> 01:00:25,191
<i>The colors were harmonious.</i>

1179
01:00:31,664 --> 01:00:32,766
This is pretty.

1180
01:00:34,000 --> 01:00:37,871
<i>My theme is an elegant queen</i>
<i>clothed in time.</i>

1181
01:00:38,638 --> 01:00:43,543
<i>Since it could also appear in a magazine,</i>
<i>I had to make it beautiful and elegant.</i>

1182
01:00:44,577 --> 01:00:47,147
<i>I wanted the colors to be warm and deep.</i>

1183
01:00:47,947 --> 01:00:52,819
<i>I wanted to create</i>
<i>a warm and bright atmosphere</i>

1184
01:00:52,886 --> 01:00:55,522
<i>by using hues</i>
<i>like wine, red, and rose gold.</i>

1185
01:00:55,588 --> 01:00:57,724
<i>I wanted to make her look so regal.</i>

1186
01:01:02,062 --> 01:01:05,799
<i>Because she's older,</i>
<i>her skin texture is a bit different.</i>

1187
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:08,201
Am I taking too much?

1188
01:01:08,368 --> 01:01:10,637
I'll give her a Sulwhasoo bath.

1189
01:01:11,004 --> 01:01:13,206
<i>For the base makeup,</i>

1190
01:01:13,273 --> 01:01:16,476
<i>I tried to create</i>
<i>a velvety, matte texture.</i>

1191
01:01:16,910 --> 01:01:20,013
<i>I wanted to create impactful makeup.</i>

1192
01:01:20,313 --> 01:01:22,148
I need to use a black shadow too.

1193
01:01:22,849 --> 01:01:28,321
<i>I thought of trying a smoky makeup</i>
<i>to embody a charismatic and cool look.</i>

1194
01:01:30,290 --> 01:01:33,460
<i>I worked really hard and gave it my all,</i>

1195
01:01:33,593 --> 01:01:37,831
<i>so I hope I can deliver a performance</i>
<i>that I'll be satisfied with.</i>

1196
01:01:42,035 --> 01:01:43,837
<i>I really want to do a great job.</i>

1197
01:01:44,270 --> 01:01:46,272
<i>I really want to do well.</i>

1198
01:01:46,339 --> 01:01:48,608
<i>I want to try my best. I want to be good.</i>

1199
01:01:50,110 --> 01:01:53,680
<i>I don't know who will win,</i>
<i>but I'm the winner in my heart.</i>

1200
01:01:53,747 --> 01:01:54,748
It's me.

1201
01:01:55,448 --> 01:02:00,520
The top three are now ready to win.

1202
01:02:01,921 --> 01:02:03,356
This is the long-awaited final round.

1203
01:02:04,057 --> 01:02:06,926
You will have 120 minutes
to do your makeup.

1204
01:02:07,227 --> 01:02:09,629
Please grab your brushes

1205
01:02:09,863 --> 01:02:12,399
and start creating your makeup look now.

1206
01:02:12,465 --> 01:02:14,234
THE FINAL MAKEUP BEGINS

1207
01:02:14,601 --> 01:02:16,169
- Good luck!
- Good luck!

1208
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:18,471
- You got this!
- Good luck!

1209
01:02:18,738 --> 01:02:20,240
Go, Detailed Hands!

1210
01:02:21,941 --> 01:02:23,710
- I used these two.
- There they are.

1211
01:02:23,777 --> 01:02:25,445
My goodness.

1212
01:02:25,512 --> 01:02:26,746
So immersive.

1213
01:02:26,813 --> 01:02:28,248
This is so cool.

1214
01:02:28,581 --> 01:02:30,950
An artist who works at a salon.

1215
01:02:31,151 --> 01:02:33,353
A freelancer from abroad.

1216
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,188
And an artist
who works for a foreign brand.

1217
01:02:36,690 --> 01:02:38,258
This will make my skin even better.

1218
01:02:38,825 --> 01:02:41,594
I really like your touch.

1219
01:02:42,162 --> 01:02:44,931
Don't worry about me
feeling uncomfortable.

1220
01:02:44,998 --> 01:02:47,300
You're free to do as you please today.

1221
01:02:47,567 --> 01:02:48,601
Okay.

1222
01:02:51,404 --> 01:02:54,040
I'm so not used to looking like this
that I keep snickering.

1223
01:02:54,107 --> 01:02:55,608
I've never seen my face like this before.

1224
01:02:56,242 --> 01:02:57,911
I'm really curious about all of them.

1225
01:02:57,977 --> 01:03:00,046
- How would they look?
- How will they work this out?

1226
01:03:00,113 --> 01:03:02,449
- They all have different themes.
- Right.
