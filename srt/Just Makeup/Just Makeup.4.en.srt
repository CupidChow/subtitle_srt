1
00:00:05,088 --> 00:00:07,508
Now then,
the moment we've been waiting for.

2
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:10,302
1-ON-1 DEATH MATCH MIRROR ROUND
Models for Red Horse, please enter.

3
00:00:23,106 --> 00:00:23,941
That's bold.

4
00:00:24,983 --> 00:00:29,029
Here come the two very bold red horses.

5
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:34,785
I will now present the looks to you.

6
00:00:34,993 --> 00:00:38,539
The first look is called
"A General on a Red Horse."

7
00:00:43,585 --> 00:00:47,214
He's a general on a red horse,
racing to 2026.

8
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,592
The general's tribe has a ritual

9
00:00:50,759 --> 00:00:53,720
where they paint their faces
to turn themselves into a talisman,

10
00:00:53,804 --> 00:00:55,931
representing their quiet determination.

11
00:01:02,396 --> 00:01:05,691
The second look is called
"God of Victory."

12
00:01:10,153 --> 00:01:14,074
He's a horse, not a man,
leading an army on a battlefield

13
00:01:14,157 --> 00:01:16,952
as the God of Victory
full of boldness and passion.

14
00:01:16,994 --> 00:01:20,080
This artist has created a makeup look
to depict a racing horse

15
00:01:20,163 --> 00:01:22,040
running so fast that its mane is on fire.

16
00:01:28,839 --> 00:01:31,967
Judges, please begin your evaluations.

17
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:36,805
EVALUATING THE RED HORSE LOOK

18
00:01:37,055 --> 00:01:37,973
They don't need to get so close!

19
00:01:38,015 --> 00:01:39,308
- Don't come so close!
- I rushed on the details!

20
00:01:39,349 --> 00:01:41,685
Can't they just
look at the models from afar?

21
00:01:42,394 --> 00:01:45,522
The texture is different.

22
00:01:45,981 --> 00:01:49,568
<i>They approached my model</i>
<i>as soon as the evaluation started.</i>

23
00:01:49,651 --> 00:01:52,029
<i>My gosh, that was...</i>

24
00:01:52,446 --> 00:01:54,448
- I also... Yes, the texture.
- This texture...

25
00:01:54,531 --> 00:01:56,700
- He looks so much cooler close-up.
- Yes.

26
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:58,368
That's crazy.

27
00:01:58,452 --> 00:01:59,286
I mean...

28
00:02:00,287 --> 00:02:02,748
- The shape is...
- The texture is unbelievable.

29
00:02:05,042 --> 00:02:07,753
- What did they use for this?
- It looks so different up close.

30
00:02:08,253 --> 00:02:09,087
Did they...

31
00:02:09,171 --> 00:02:10,881
- Did this person use a sticker...
- Is it airbrushed?

32
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,051
on the model's face? Or is it a spray?

33
00:02:14,134 --> 00:02:16,303
- I don't think...
- It doesn't seem like a sticker, does it?

34
00:02:16,386 --> 00:02:17,846
- It's too perfect to be a sticker, right?
- The color gradient.

35
00:02:17,888 --> 00:02:18,930
- Yes.
- Yes, it is.

36
00:02:19,723 --> 00:02:21,642
- This is incredible.
- It's so cool.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:31,610
Of course.

38
00:02:31,943 --> 00:02:34,821
Director Jung is taking a very close look.
She was my teacher, after all.

39
00:02:35,322 --> 00:02:36,406
I wonder if she knows it was me.

40
00:02:36,657 --> 00:02:39,660
Director Jung, it's me!

41
00:02:39,743 --> 00:02:41,078
Bang on the wall.

42
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,996
- Scream.
- I mean...

43
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,793
That's beautiful.

44
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:49,753
The details are so amazing.

45
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:55,801
- The gold looks beautiful.
- Indeed.

46
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:59,096
- Aren't the upward golden strokes pretty?
- Yes, they are.

47
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:01,056
They're completely different.

48
00:03:01,098 --> 00:03:03,016
- I know.
- They're too different.

49
00:03:03,141 --> 00:03:05,727
- Don't cry, Director Jung.
- What do I do?

50
00:03:06,103 --> 00:03:07,604
She must've decided already.

51
00:03:07,646 --> 00:03:09,106
My goodness!

52
00:03:09,773 --> 00:03:11,400
I can't choose one.

53
00:03:11,817 --> 00:03:13,193
I mean...

54
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:15,112
Both of them are...

55
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,196
Let's go back.

56
00:03:16,279 --> 00:03:18,198
- She decided so quickly.
- I know.

57
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:19,324
I'm in a pickle.

58
00:03:20,492 --> 00:03:22,035
I don't know what to do.

59
00:03:22,119 --> 00:03:24,621
I wonder who the makeup artists are.

60
00:03:25,372 --> 00:03:28,792
The first look is
"A General on a Red Horse."

61
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:32,796
- The second look is "God of Victory."
- "God of Victory."

62
00:03:33,046 --> 00:03:35,632
If you've decided on the makeup look

63
00:03:36,174 --> 00:03:38,385
that best represents
the theme of Red Horse,

64
00:03:38,468 --> 00:03:40,804
please vote.

65
00:03:44,224 --> 00:03:46,768
It's number 1 for the model on the left
and number 2 for the model on the right.

66
00:03:47,894 --> 00:03:49,229
My heart is pounding.

67
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:51,398
- My gosh.
- It's pounding.

68
00:03:51,481 --> 00:03:52,983
- Like that of a red horse.
- Exactly.

69
00:03:53,692 --> 00:03:56,153
My heart is pounding.
I'm really nervous now.

70
00:03:58,029 --> 00:04:00,490
It seems that this was
a very difficult choice to make.

71
00:04:01,158 --> 00:04:04,119
Now then, let's see which makeup artists
worked on these Red Horse looks.

72
00:04:04,953 --> 00:04:08,123
The two artists who competed
in the Red Horse match,

73
00:04:08,165 --> 00:04:09,207
please enter.

74
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:12,586
Who were the artists
that made this so hard?

75
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,504
Seriously.

76
00:04:14,588 --> 00:04:15,672
Could it be...

77
00:04:16,965 --> 00:04:18,675
Of course!

78
00:04:20,761 --> 00:04:22,137
Of course!

79
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:26,099
The artists were
Golden Hand in Paris and Glitter Magician.

80
00:04:26,391 --> 00:04:27,768
Hello.

81
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,352
Hello.

82
00:04:29,394 --> 00:04:31,688
- Both of you worked so hard.
- Hello.

83
00:04:31,772 --> 00:04:34,858
First, we'll reveal the results

84
00:04:34,941 --> 00:04:36,359
before we continue.

85
00:04:36,693 --> 00:04:39,029
Please reveal the results

86
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,531
of the Red Horse match
in the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

87
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:43,241
Who's the winner?

88
00:04:50,332 --> 00:04:51,458
Let's see!

89
00:04:52,667 --> 00:04:55,378
- I can't wait! Hurry up!
- I'm so curious.

90
00:04:56,379 --> 00:04:57,714
<i>I also did a great job.</i>

91
00:04:57,756 --> 00:04:59,466
<i>I did really well.</i>

92
00:05:00,175 --> 00:05:02,219
<i>I could feel my facial muscles twitching,</i>

93
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,013
<i>but I couldn't control them.</i>

94
00:05:06,681 --> 00:05:10,560
<i>We could only allow one person</i>
<i>to advance to the next round.</i>

95
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:15,398
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

96
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,067
GLITTER MAGICIAN: 1
GOLDEN HAND IN PARIS: 3

97
00:05:17,108 --> 00:05:19,194
- Congratulations.
- Congratulations.

98
00:05:19,236 --> 00:05:20,779
With a score of 3 to 1,

99
00:05:20,862 --> 00:05:23,406
Golden Hand in Paris has passed.

100
00:05:27,536 --> 00:05:28,912
Thank you!

101
00:05:28,995 --> 00:05:30,997
- Great work.
- Glitter Magician,

102
00:05:31,081 --> 00:05:33,416
- unfortunately, has been eliminated.
- Yes.

103
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:35,418
Let's hear why you've chosen your artists.

104
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,339
Firstly, the texture of the pop of red

105
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:42,092
looked so different close-up

106
00:05:42,133 --> 00:05:44,636
than from far away.

107
00:05:44,719 --> 00:05:48,265
The texture was so powerful,
and I fell in love with it.

108
00:05:48,932 --> 00:05:50,767
And you, Seo Ok?

109
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:53,436
I thought about
the focus of my judging criteria,

110
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,439
and I told myself
that I'd vote for the most unique look

111
00:05:56,523 --> 00:05:59,317
for this particular keyword.

112
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:01,152
Then, the model entered.

113
00:06:01,695 --> 00:06:03,697
<i>Immediately, I knew</i>
<i>I had to vote for the first model.</i>

114
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:06,491
But had his face
just been covered in red face paint,

115
00:06:06,575 --> 00:06:08,285
I would've gotten mad.

116
00:06:08,368 --> 00:06:11,329
I was sure there was more to it,
so I went closer.

117
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:15,208
<i>Then, the look took my breath away.</i>

118
00:06:15,292 --> 00:06:18,795
It also reminded me
of the powerful start to a new year,

119
00:06:18,879 --> 00:06:21,089
when you feel like you can do anything,

120
00:06:21,131 --> 00:06:23,300
- much like a general's determination.
- That's right.

121
00:06:23,341 --> 00:06:25,302
I could really feel that,

122
00:06:25,343 --> 00:06:27,804
so I voted for the first look
without hesitation.

123
00:06:27,888 --> 00:06:31,057
I feel thrilled

124
00:06:31,141 --> 00:06:33,727
whenever I look
at Golden Hand in Paris's work.

125
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,313
The look was perfect. It thrilled me,

126
00:06:36,354 --> 00:06:39,399
and I feel so inspired by her hands
that are stained in red.

127
00:06:39,482 --> 00:06:42,319
This is what makeup is all about.
You're incredible!

128
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:44,821
- Thank you so much.
- You're the best.

129
00:06:44,863 --> 00:06:46,823
You're real judges, indeed.

130
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:49,326
- You even notice their hands.
- Yes.

131
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,161
- Those hands are inspiring.
- I see.

132
00:06:54,039 --> 00:06:57,667
Glitter Magician has
unfortunately been eliminated.

133
00:06:57,709 --> 00:07:00,170
Please make your last speech
before you leave.

134
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:02,589
It was such an honor to compete against

135
00:07:02,672 --> 00:07:04,799
someone I follow for references.

136
00:07:07,344 --> 00:07:08,511
It's unfortunate.

137
00:07:08,553 --> 00:07:12,140
I stepped out courageously,
as I hadn't seen her model.

138
00:07:12,182 --> 00:07:15,185
It was such an interesting keyword

139
00:07:15,226 --> 00:07:16,937
that I really wanted to challenge myself.

140
00:07:17,020 --> 00:07:18,605
That was why I chose the keyword.

141
00:07:18,688 --> 00:07:19,689
- You were incredible.
- It's been an honor.

142
00:07:19,773 --> 00:07:21,608
- Thank you.
- You were wonderful.

143
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,654
- Great work!
- Thank you.

144
00:07:26,821 --> 00:07:29,616
She has impeccable taste.
You can tell from everything about her.

145
00:07:29,699 --> 00:07:31,409
- I'm so excited about her future looks.
- Same!

146
00:07:31,493 --> 00:07:34,496
- We passed her right away last time too!
- Exactly.

147
00:07:38,375 --> 00:07:39,334
No way!

148
00:07:41,378 --> 00:07:43,338
Congratulations!

149
00:07:48,677 --> 00:07:50,762
<i>It was difficult but fun.</i>

150
00:07:50,845 --> 00:07:53,890
<i>It was a very precious experience</i>

151
00:07:53,932 --> 00:07:57,727
<i>to direct the entire look</i>
<i>and to work on this project.</i>

152
00:07:57,769 --> 00:08:00,730
<i>And it was so much fun for me.</i>

153
00:08:01,940 --> 00:08:05,276
I should've chosen an easier path.

154
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,319
I'm sad.

155
00:08:06,528 --> 00:08:08,780
But I still think I did well.

156
00:08:10,073 --> 00:08:11,241
I did a great job.

157
00:08:16,037 --> 00:08:19,916
I wish I could just watch the others.

158
00:08:19,958 --> 00:08:21,584
It's fun when you're just watching.

159
00:08:21,876 --> 00:08:23,920
- Look at them.
- This is such a fun mission.

160
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,755
We can directly compare the two looks!

161
00:08:25,797 --> 00:08:28,008
Their approaches are completely different.

162
00:08:28,466 --> 00:08:29,801
Did you see the oriental look?

163
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,886
- It's stunning.
- It's absolutely beautiful.

164
00:08:32,262 --> 00:08:33,888
That's a winning candidate.

165
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:35,098
Who?

166
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:36,391
The oriental look.

167
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:40,395
My gosh! No way.

168
00:08:40,854 --> 00:08:42,105
Unbelievable.

169
00:08:42,897 --> 00:08:44,149
That's stunning!

170
00:08:44,232 --> 00:08:45,734
FUSION ORIENTALISM
I got goosebumps.

171
00:08:46,151 --> 00:08:48,153
They both look incredibly beautiful.

172
00:08:48,236 --> 00:08:49,404
It's next-level.

173
00:08:49,446 --> 00:08:50,655
It's a battlefield here!

174
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,282
Their battle is so intense.

175
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:54,242
The Fusion Orientalism match.

176
00:08:54,284 --> 00:08:56,786
It was fresh, yet sophisticated.

177
00:08:56,828 --> 00:08:59,039
<i>They looked like</i>
<i>they were ready for a fashion show.</i>

178
00:08:59,122 --> 00:09:01,166
<i>They looked so clean and beautiful.</i>

179
00:09:01,249 --> 00:09:03,626
Major respect to both artists.

180
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:09,090
Both artists are too talented
to be eliminated.

181
00:09:10,050 --> 00:09:12,802
DURING THE 1-ON-1 ROUND MATCHING
I'll choose the next brush.

182
00:09:17,557 --> 00:09:18,850
Makeup Trendsetter.

183
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:20,393
Makeup Trendsetter

184
00:09:20,477 --> 00:09:22,520
looked so charismatic

185
00:09:22,604 --> 00:09:25,148
from the moment she entered the set.

186
00:09:25,190 --> 00:09:28,026
She looked just like me!

187
00:09:28,109 --> 00:09:30,236
<i>The completely clean, slicked hair</i>

188
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,238
<i>with a statement red lip and glasses.</i>

189
00:09:32,322 --> 00:09:34,657
<i>Then, when I saw her look in Round One...</i>

190
00:09:34,699 --> 00:09:36,910
<i>It's called "A Freckled Girl in Spring."</i>

191
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:38,787
You made her skin look perfect.

192
00:09:38,828 --> 00:09:41,873
You've smoothly incorporated
trendy elements,

193
00:09:41,956 --> 00:09:44,000
and I can tell
you're very detail-oriented.

194
00:09:44,501 --> 00:09:47,295
<i>The model looked</i>
<i>so youthful and beautiful.</i>

195
00:09:47,337 --> 00:09:50,465
<i>I immediately passed her</i>
<i>without hesitation.</i>

196
00:09:50,507 --> 00:09:53,218
She was very active as an artist

197
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,428
FORMER ESPOIR SENIOR PRO-ARTIST
<i>for the brand under my company.</i>

198
00:09:55,512 --> 00:09:59,182
She has excellent talents and skills,

199
00:09:59,265 --> 00:10:00,642
<i>so I'm excited for her.</i>

200
00:10:00,683 --> 00:10:03,520
I'll choose Fusion Orientalism.

201
00:10:03,561 --> 00:10:06,439
You've chosen Fusion Orientalism.

202
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:07,941
For Fusion Orientalism,

203
00:10:08,024 --> 00:10:09,859
<i>you will be asked to incorporate</i>
<i>another theme with oriental beauty</i>

204
00:10:09,943 --> 00:10:12,737
<i>and create a look</i>
<i>with a new perspective on orientalism.</i>

205
00:10:13,196 --> 00:10:17,534
Who wants to go against Makeup Trendsetter
for Fusion Orientalism?

206
00:10:17,700 --> 00:10:19,285
Please step forward.

207
00:10:19,536 --> 00:10:20,662
- What?
- Oh, my!

208
00:10:21,454 --> 00:10:22,497
- Come up.
- She's popular!

209
00:10:22,539 --> 00:10:23,748
Three people!

210
00:10:24,249 --> 00:10:25,625
- All right.
- That's intense.

211
00:10:26,960 --> 00:10:28,711
<i>I guess I look like an easy target.</i>

212
00:10:29,546 --> 00:10:30,839
<i>Do I look easy?</i>

213
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,924
<i>I have a red lip on.</i>
<i>Do I really look easy?</i>

214
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:36,052
First Empress Myeongseong,
Big Sister of Beauty, and Beauty Wiki.

215
00:10:36,094 --> 00:10:38,721
You must choose one of the three.

216
00:10:40,056 --> 00:10:42,517
<i>I have the chance to choose my opponent.</i>

217
00:10:42,559 --> 00:10:43,935
<i>That's very lucky.</i>

218
00:10:44,018 --> 00:10:45,478
<i>First Empress Myeongseong.</i>

219
00:10:45,562 --> 00:10:47,397
<i>As she was experienced in stage makeup,</i>

220
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:51,276
<i>I knew she'd excel at using</i>
<i>the right lines for an oriental look.</i>

221
00:10:51,609 --> 00:10:53,194
<i>Beauty Wiki.</i>

222
00:10:53,236 --> 00:10:57,532
<i>She knows how to create different content</i>
<i>in very creative ways.</i>

223
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:00,326
Have you made a decision?

224
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:01,995
I'm very torn.

225
00:11:04,789 --> 00:11:07,250
But I'd like to challenge
Big Sister of Beauty.

226
00:11:07,917 --> 00:11:09,169
Thank you.

227
00:11:09,252 --> 00:11:11,713
CHIEF DIRECTOR OF "WOO HYUN JEUNG MERCI"
That's a tough match!

228
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:14,132
<i>I'm very confident.</i>

229
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,842
My experience and expertise.

230
00:11:16,593 --> 00:11:18,052
I doubt

231
00:11:18,845 --> 00:11:20,221
she can beat that.

232
00:11:21,890 --> 00:11:22,974
- My gosh!
- Who's that?

233
00:11:23,391 --> 00:11:25,226
- It's Director Woo Hyun-jeung.
- No way!

234
00:11:25,435 --> 00:11:28,146
- Aren't you too experienced to be here?
- Director Woo!

235
00:11:28,229 --> 00:11:29,981
You're one of the top figures
in the industry.

236
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:32,108
Big Sister of Beauty,
you'll be put on hold.

237
00:11:32,192 --> 00:11:33,651
I didn't pay enough attention
to the details.

238
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,528
I admit it.

239
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:38,281
Congratulations, Big Sister of Beauty.

240
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:42,869
<i>I'm quite competitive,</i>

241
00:11:42,952 --> 00:11:46,456
so the higher I go, the bolder I become.

242
00:11:46,539 --> 00:11:49,459
<i>I haven't felt this passionate</i>

243
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:50,877
<i>in a very long time.</i>

244
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:53,630
<i>I respect her.</i>

245
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:56,966
But I believe I'm better than her

246
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:01,012
<i>at incorporating today's trendy elements.</i>

247
00:12:01,095 --> 00:12:03,431
I'm younger, after all.

248
00:12:05,058 --> 00:12:07,435
<i>You can't be considerate in competition.</i>

249
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:09,354
Beat me if you can.

250
00:12:10,104 --> 00:12:11,022
It's a big match.

251
00:12:11,105 --> 00:12:12,357
MAKEUP TRENDSETTER
VS. BIG SISTER OF BEAUTY

252
00:12:13,274 --> 00:12:15,526
The models' facial features
look very Asian.

253
00:12:15,610 --> 00:12:17,028
- You're right.
- Yes.

254
00:12:17,528 --> 00:12:19,989
I think there are definite
pros and cons to that.

255
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,533
FUSION ORIENTALISM TWIN MODELS:
SEO HYUN AND SEO YUN

256
00:12:23,326 --> 00:12:25,620
Let's get started.

257
00:12:25,954 --> 00:12:27,455
<i>When I saw the topic,</i>

258
00:12:27,497 --> 00:12:30,959
I thought the biggest focus was
on melting traditional elements

259
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:32,752
into the look.

260
00:12:32,835 --> 00:12:36,464
I wanted to combine traditional elements
with futuristic elements.

261
00:12:36,547 --> 00:12:40,301
<i>The look is a future-oriental look,</i>

262
00:12:40,343 --> 00:12:41,844
<i>where future and present coexist.</i>

263
00:12:42,512 --> 00:12:45,014
<i>I warned the model that it'd be shocking</i>

264
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,892
right from the start.

265
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:51,062
<i>I wanted to portray</i>
<i>fear of the unknown and the future.</i>

266
00:12:51,688 --> 00:12:53,147
She's using a glue stick.

267
00:12:53,189 --> 00:12:54,732
It's the big glue stick.

268
00:12:54,816 --> 00:12:56,150
She's gluing her brows.

269
00:12:57,193 --> 00:12:58,403
<i>I started by gluing the brows.</i>

270
00:12:58,486 --> 00:13:01,406
<i>I meticulously stuck</i>
<i>every brow hair to her forehead.</i>

271
00:13:01,906 --> 00:13:06,119
You need to use the glue stick on the face
before any base makeup.

272
00:13:06,577 --> 00:13:08,079
It doesn't stick
if there's product on the skin.

273
00:13:08,997 --> 00:13:11,040
<i>Then, I lifted the brows</i>
<i>as much as possible.</i>

274
00:13:11,332 --> 00:13:12,792
<i>In this unstable future,</i>

275
00:13:12,875 --> 00:13:15,211
nobody's brows can show their emotions.

276
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:18,548
I'm surprised she knows how to do that
when she worked at a boutique for so long.

277
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:21,968
Artists don't usually get to do that
unless they're working for a fashion show.

278
00:13:22,051 --> 00:13:24,637
<i>Then, I got started on the eye makeup.</i>

279
00:13:24,721 --> 00:13:27,849
<i>I started by smacking some mascara</i>
<i>on her eyelids.</i>

280
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:31,561
<i>That way, the texture seemed grotesque.</i>

281
00:13:31,602 --> 00:13:35,231
<i>I wanted to work with a rough texture,</i>

282
00:13:35,315 --> 00:13:37,317
so I used a rough dish sponge.

283
00:13:42,530 --> 00:13:45,658
<i>I also used a scrub towel.</i>
<i>I used them all over her face</i>

284
00:13:45,742 --> 00:13:47,660
<i>to create rough waves.</i>

285
00:13:52,290 --> 00:13:53,583
I didn't expect this at all.

286
00:13:55,376 --> 00:13:59,464
I was wondering how you'd use these tools

287
00:13:59,547 --> 00:14:01,090
when I first saw them.

288
00:14:03,259 --> 00:14:04,927
That looks so cool!

289
00:14:06,596 --> 00:14:09,515
<i>Then, I controlled the brightness</i>
<i>while adding silver.</i>

290
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:13,311
<i>I blended silver into the look,</i>
<i>adding an extra layer of texture.</i>

291
00:14:13,394 --> 00:14:16,189
<i>That created a three-dimensional look</i>
<i>with depth.</i>

292
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,441
<i>But I needed to make it look</i>
<i>more futuristic,</i>

293
00:14:18,483 --> 00:14:19,484
<i>and I relied on my instincts to do so.</i>

294
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:22,487
- Is this for Fusion Orientalism?
- Yes.

295
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,823
- You have bold touches.
- Yes.

296
00:14:26,616 --> 00:14:28,910
- Is this a dish sponge?
- Yes, it is.

297
00:14:28,951 --> 00:14:30,119
It's to add texture.

298
00:14:31,287 --> 00:14:32,538
- That's bold.
- Yes, it is.

299
00:14:32,622 --> 00:14:34,707
I'm unleashing the old art major in me.

300
00:14:34,791 --> 00:14:36,626
- Did you major in art?
- Yes.

301
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,336
- I see.
- So, I'm adding extra texture.

302
00:14:38,795 --> 00:14:40,630
You can tell she studied art.

303
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:45,426
It must be so much pressure
to work with such a big crowd.

304
00:14:45,468 --> 00:14:47,512
If everyone is just watching one person,

305
00:14:47,804 --> 00:14:49,097
I'm sure you can feel it.

306
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:52,141
It must be so stressful

307
00:14:52,225 --> 00:14:54,894
to be hard at work
while everyone's watching your opponent.

308
00:14:58,064 --> 00:14:59,399
<i>I felt very self-conscious.</i>

309
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:03,194
My eyes were darting,
and my mind almost went blank.

310
00:15:03,653 --> 00:15:05,571
<i>Firstly, my look must've seemed</i>

311
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:08,658
<i>quite basic at the start.</i>

312
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:12,328
<i>But Big Sister of Beauty made</i>
<i>the model's eyes pop from the start,</i>

313
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:14,664
<i>using a sponge and all.</i>
<i>I could hear everyone go...</i>

314
00:15:14,705 --> 00:15:16,124
That looks incredible.

315
00:15:16,457 --> 00:15:17,834
Thank you.

316
00:15:18,418 --> 00:15:20,169
That's so cool!

317
00:15:22,213 --> 00:15:24,966
<i>I could hear everyone gasp in awe.</i>

318
00:15:25,007 --> 00:15:26,968
I already felt like I'd been eliminated.

319
00:15:27,510 --> 00:15:30,012
Have you looked at the other model?

320
00:15:30,054 --> 00:15:31,514
- No.
- It's a very dramatic look.

321
00:15:31,848 --> 00:15:33,182
It's very bold.

322
00:15:33,266 --> 00:15:36,144
- It's not time for the highlight yet.
- Not yet?

323
00:15:36,185 --> 00:15:37,979
- Are you working on the basics for now?
- Yes.

324
00:15:38,020 --> 00:15:40,857
I'll add a pop of red in the look.

325
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:43,526
<i>Of all oriental elements,</i>

326
00:15:43,568 --> 00:15:46,154
I incorporated more Korean ones.

327
00:15:46,195 --> 00:15:49,532
<i>I interpreted oriental beauty</i>
<i>as that of control.</i>

328
00:15:49,574 --> 00:15:53,661
Then, I added some glossiness,

329
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:55,538
a central element
for stage looks nowadays.

330
00:15:55,580 --> 00:15:57,373
<i>By adding that glossiness,</i>

331
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:01,878
<i>I created a trendy,</i>
<i>Y2K-style oriental look.</i>

332
00:16:02,086 --> 00:16:05,298
<i>I mimicked the color spreading</i>
<i>in ink wash paintings</i>

333
00:16:05,381 --> 00:16:07,508
<i>by blending the black eyeshadow out.</i>

334
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:09,844
<i>That was the start.</i>

335
00:16:12,722 --> 00:16:15,057
It's time for some lines now.

336
00:16:15,308 --> 00:16:17,268
I have to draw orchids.

337
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:21,481
<i>I added some more Asian-style lines</i>
<i>around the eyes.</i>

338
00:16:21,564 --> 00:16:23,065
Orchids in the ink wash painting!

339
00:16:23,149 --> 00:16:26,235
<i>I incorporated</i>
<i>artistic elements as highlights.</i>

340
00:16:26,736 --> 00:16:28,404
That's what she's drawing.

341
00:16:30,239 --> 00:16:32,909
- She's drawing...
- She's drawing something.

342
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:34,869
Impressive.

343
00:16:36,621 --> 00:16:40,625
<i>Many people think of red</i>
<i>when they think of orientalism.</i>

344
00:16:40,708 --> 00:16:42,418
<i>You know the trend</i>
<i>where people draw moles?</i>

345
00:16:42,460 --> 00:16:44,754
<i>I borrowed that trend</i>

346
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:46,672
<i>and marked red dots on her cheeks,</i>

347
00:16:46,756 --> 00:16:50,134
<i>but I purposely kept them asymmetrical</i>
<i>to bring more attention.</i>

348
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,345
That's stunning.

349
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:55,181
- The red dots are eye-catching.
- Indeed.

350
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,434
Here come the lotus flowers
out of your eyes.

351
00:16:58,518 --> 00:16:59,936
Lotus flowers.

352
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:01,395
<i>Then, I got to lotus flowers.</i>

353
00:17:01,437 --> 00:17:05,274
<i>I added Y2K highlighter</i>
<i>in the lotus flower shade.</i>

354
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,986
<i>I wanted a subtle, clear glow</i>
<i>under the spotlight.</i>

355
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:10,780
<i>You know the color of a lotus bloom?</i>

356
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:13,241
<i>I thought that'd bring the look together,</i>

357
00:17:13,282 --> 00:17:15,368
<i>so I added the color onto her face</i>
<i>very naturally.</i>

358
00:17:17,453 --> 00:17:19,372
Please get changed and come back.

359
00:17:19,455 --> 00:17:20,373
Okay.

360
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:24,377
I want it to look
more traditionally Korean.

361
00:17:24,460 --> 00:17:26,879
How about we add this on her chest?

362
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:28,464
That's beautiful!

363
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,966
- Right?
- Yes.

364
00:17:30,132 --> 00:17:32,343
Doesn't it look like
a <i>hanbok</i> photoshoot for <i>Vogue</i>?

365
00:17:33,344 --> 00:17:34,971
This makeup is more eye-catching.

366
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:37,306
- But isn't that look so beautiful?
- Yes.

367
00:17:37,974 --> 00:17:40,142
The looks are so different!

368
00:17:40,476 --> 00:17:41,811
It's so much fun to watch.

369
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:45,731
- Beautiful!
- My gosh!

370
00:17:45,815 --> 00:17:47,024
- They're indeed artists.
- Oh, goodness.

371
00:17:47,108 --> 00:17:48,651
- They look so cool.
- Incredibly cool.

372
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,528
Both of them look absolutely incredible.

373
00:17:50,611 --> 00:17:51,821
What a difficult battle it will be.

374
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:55,992
They look exquisite.

375
00:17:56,033 --> 00:17:57,451
FUSION ORIENTALISM

376
00:17:57,493 --> 00:18:00,329
I'm very excited to see the looks
for Fusion Orientalism.

377
00:18:00,371 --> 00:18:01,581
I saw their looks halfway through,

378
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:03,666
- and they looked very interesting.
- Really?

379
00:18:04,125 --> 00:18:05,835
What if it's another hard decision?

380
00:18:06,836 --> 00:18:08,963
- I think it will be.
- Oh, no!

381
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:12,675
Models for Fusion Orientalism,
please enter.

382
00:18:15,803 --> 00:18:17,763
- Yes!
- No way.

383
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,355
That's breathtaking.

384
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:27,773
This is the best.

385
00:18:38,367 --> 00:18:39,994
They look spectacular.

386
00:18:44,332 --> 00:18:49,211
<i>There's a stark contrast</i>
<i>between the two looks.</i>

387
00:18:50,630 --> 00:18:51,839
This is what I'm talking about.

388
00:18:51,881 --> 00:18:53,799
I will now present the looks.

389
00:18:53,883 --> 00:18:57,053
The first look is called
"Y2K-Mood Oriental."

390
00:18:57,511 --> 00:18:59,055
The look features
the controlled lines of Asian beauty

391
00:18:59,138 --> 00:19:01,557
with red, the color of luck and energy,

392
00:19:01,641 --> 00:19:03,851
in the form of beauty moles,
a current trend.

393
00:19:03,893 --> 00:19:06,354
The elements were combined
to create this fusion oriental look.

394
00:19:11,275 --> 00:19:15,029
The second look is called
"Future Shaped in Asiatic Light."

395
00:19:15,363 --> 00:19:16,906
This artist added
a touch of Asiatic warmth

396
00:19:16,989 --> 00:19:20,660
to the cold, metallic look.

397
00:19:24,038 --> 00:19:26,999
I feel like I almost hear
traditional Asian music playing.

398
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:27,917
Yes!

399
00:19:28,417 --> 00:19:30,878
I can almost hear the <i>gayageum.</i>

400
00:19:30,920 --> 00:19:33,547
Judges, please begin

401
00:19:33,589 --> 00:19:34,799
your evaluations.

402
00:19:35,675 --> 00:19:36,967
I'm already struggling.

403
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:38,511
I can't even go up.

404
00:19:38,761 --> 00:19:41,097
They have this unapproachable aura.

405
00:19:41,138 --> 00:19:44,100
Yes, I'm too intimidated to get closer.

406
00:19:44,600 --> 00:19:46,686
I can see the Asiatic glow.

407
00:19:46,769 --> 00:19:48,437
- It's radiating, right?
- Yes.

408
00:19:51,065 --> 00:19:52,775
This person used mother-of-pearl!

409
00:19:53,651 --> 00:19:56,404
<i>When I approached the models</i>
<i>to take a closer look,</i>

410
00:19:56,445 --> 00:20:00,116
<i>I was enchanted</i>
<i>by the mystical Asian aura.</i>

411
00:20:00,783 --> 00:20:03,160
I felt like I was almost drawn into her!

412
00:20:03,411 --> 00:20:04,995
<i>There was the mother-of-pearl,</i>

413
00:20:05,079 --> 00:20:07,832
<i>and this artist concentrated</i>
<i>the silver light to the center</i>

414
00:20:07,915 --> 00:20:10,042
<i>to design a mystical look.</i>

415
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,712
<i>Overall, it was very beautiful.</i>

416
00:20:13,629 --> 00:20:17,883
<i>This artist interpreted orientalism</i>
<i>in a wonderful way.</i>

417
00:20:17,967 --> 00:20:20,803
<i>The outfit, the hairstyle,</i>
<i>the pin in her hair,</i>

418
00:20:20,845 --> 00:20:24,181
<i>and all the other elements</i>
<i>were so well-balanced.</i>

419
00:20:24,265 --> 00:20:27,852
<i>Big Sister of Beauty is very famous,</i>

420
00:20:27,935 --> 00:20:30,646
<i>and so many were in awe of her work</i>
<i>in the process.</i>

421
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:33,733
I was ready
for the possibility of elimination.

422
00:20:34,233 --> 00:20:36,485
<i>I didn't even have to get closer</i>
<i>to feel this.</i>

423
00:20:36,694 --> 00:20:39,155
<i>When the model moved slightly,</i>

424
00:20:39,196 --> 00:20:42,658
<i>I could see a subtle purple glow</i>
<i>all over her face,</i>

425
00:20:43,117 --> 00:20:44,618
<i>which I found exquisite.</i>

426
00:20:45,411 --> 00:20:48,456
<i>She did an excellent job at showcasing</i>
<i>the idea of "controlled beauty."</i>

427
00:20:48,664 --> 00:20:50,499
<i>She definitely did a lot of research.</i>

428
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:53,544
- The two looks are totally different.
- Indeed.

429
00:20:54,837 --> 00:20:56,338
This is so hard for me.

430
00:20:58,549 --> 00:21:00,968
What a difficult call to make.

431
00:21:02,428 --> 00:21:03,929
Saem-mool, are you getting hot?

432
00:21:04,013 --> 00:21:05,723
- Yes, very hot.
- Are you feeling Asia's heat?

433
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,808
- It's burning.
- It's blazing hot.

434
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:11,312
Please vote for the better look

435
00:21:11,353 --> 00:21:14,690
in the 1-on-1 Death Match
on Future Orientalism.

436
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,985
Press 1 for the model on the left,
and press 2 for the model on the right.

437
00:21:19,612 --> 00:21:22,907
The judges are deep in thought again.

438
00:21:24,074 --> 00:21:27,495
Even I can tell from here
that it's impossible to choose one.

439
00:21:28,913 --> 00:21:30,748
All right. Have you decided?

440
00:21:36,045 --> 00:21:37,713
THE JUDGES HAVE VOTED

441
00:21:37,797 --> 00:21:40,674
We will now invite the makeup artists

442
00:21:41,091 --> 00:21:42,927
behind these looks.

443
00:21:43,010 --> 00:21:43,928
I wonder who they are.

444
00:21:45,930 --> 00:21:47,348
Hello.

445
00:21:52,978 --> 00:21:54,855
I didn't expect this at all!

446
00:21:54,897 --> 00:21:57,483
My gosh!

447
00:21:57,566 --> 00:22:00,027
The two makeup artists
for the Fusion Orientalism round were

448
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:02,905
Makeup Trendsetter
and Big Sister of Beauty.

449
00:22:02,947 --> 00:22:05,074
- Oh, my god!
- This is unbelievable.

450
00:22:05,950 --> 00:22:08,077
I had no idea
Big Sister of Beauty was behind it!

451
00:22:08,160 --> 00:22:09,912
I really had no idea.

452
00:22:09,954 --> 00:22:11,080
I know.

453
00:22:11,622 --> 00:22:14,959
Both of you prepared
such beautiful and perfect looks.

454
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:18,045
However, one of you must go home.

455
00:22:18,587 --> 00:22:23,217
I'll get right to the result reveal.

456
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:26,011
Please reveal the results

457
00:22:26,095 --> 00:22:28,556
of the Fusion Orientalism match
in the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

458
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:34,228
I can't look.

459
00:22:34,937 --> 00:22:35,938
Who's the winner?

460
00:22:37,773 --> 00:22:40,860
<i>If luck is on my side,</i>
<i>I'll make it to the next level.</i>

461
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:43,028
<i>I can't go home like this yet.</i>

462
00:22:44,113 --> 00:22:45,531
Oh, no.

463
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:54,373
In the Fusion Orientalism match
of the 1-on-1 Mirror Round,

464
00:22:54,456 --> 00:22:55,624
Makeup Trendsetter wins.

465
00:22:55,708 --> 00:22:56,584
Congratulations.

466
00:22:56,625 --> 00:22:57,835
MAKEUP TRENDSETTER WINS

467
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:02,756
Makeup Trendsetter won 3 to 1.

468
00:23:02,798 --> 00:23:04,466
- Jin-su?
- Yes.

469
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:08,345
I could see the discipline in the look
at first sight.

470
00:23:08,929 --> 00:23:13,100
<i>I looked at her from a distance</i>
<i>and from the side,</i>

471
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:17,313
<i>and the way she highlighted</i>
<i>the model's beautiful lines,</i>

472
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:19,815
<i>from her face to her collarbones,</i>

473
00:23:19,899 --> 00:23:22,151
<i>left a strong impression on me.</i>

474
00:23:22,192 --> 00:23:25,154
It was a bit of a challenge for me,

475
00:23:25,237 --> 00:23:29,658
as I wasn't experienced
with creating such a look.

476
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:31,744
But Seo Ok told me

477
00:23:32,119 --> 00:23:34,997
that she looked forward
to seeing my work in Round One,

478
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:37,333
which motivated me to choose this keyword.

479
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:41,587
I feel like you have much more to show
in the upcoming rounds.

480
00:23:41,670 --> 00:23:43,505
- So, it's a yes from me.
- Thank you.

481
00:23:43,589 --> 00:23:45,883
I'd like to give it my all

482
00:23:46,091 --> 00:23:48,677
as I continue to take on new challenges.

483
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:55,142
RISABAE, you chose Big Sister of Beauty.

484
00:23:55,184 --> 00:23:57,394
Yes, I was that one person.

485
00:23:58,312 --> 00:23:59,605
Why did you vote for her?

486
00:23:59,688 --> 00:24:02,232
My eyes just kept going to her.

487
00:24:02,316 --> 00:24:05,194
<i>Not only were the details perfect,</i>

488
00:24:05,235 --> 00:24:07,321
<i>but I could also feel its ethereal energy.</i>

489
00:24:07,696 --> 00:24:09,490
So, I just followed my heart.

490
00:24:10,240 --> 00:24:12,409
I've done everything I wanted

491
00:24:12,493 --> 00:24:14,203
on JUST MAKEUP,

492
00:24:14,244 --> 00:24:17,706
so I have no regrets as I step down.

493
00:24:17,790 --> 00:24:18,874
Great work.

494
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,839
- Good job!
- Thank you.

495
00:24:26,256 --> 00:24:27,216
Congratulations.

496
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:30,219
- Great work.
- You did great.

497
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,304
You were amazing.

498
00:24:33,263 --> 00:24:36,725
- I had no idea it was Big Sister's work.
- I know!

499
00:24:36,976 --> 00:24:37,851
Who won?

500
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:39,979
I can't tell at all!

501
00:24:43,273 --> 00:24:44,358
What?

502
00:24:46,944 --> 00:24:48,112
Congratulations!

503
00:24:48,195 --> 00:24:50,447
- That looks amazing!
- What a surprise!

504
00:24:50,531 --> 00:24:51,907
Great job!

505
00:24:52,574 --> 00:24:54,326
Congratulations!

506
00:24:54,702 --> 00:24:56,328
She looks gorgeous.

507
00:24:56,745 --> 00:24:59,623
- It was perfect.
- Indeed.

508
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:03,460
The colors and the symmetry were perfect.

509
00:25:03,544 --> 00:25:05,963
Her model looked perfect,
but the other model looked better?

510
00:25:06,046 --> 00:25:10,050
I just followed my heart,
like RISABAE did.

511
00:25:10,092 --> 00:25:12,094
I was blown away to see those two!

512
00:25:12,136 --> 00:25:13,387
Same here!

513
00:25:13,429 --> 00:25:14,763
That was very memorable, right?

514
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:15,889
- Yes.
- Yes.

515
00:25:17,558 --> 00:25:18,517
This is tough.

516
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:21,645
The 1-on-1 Mirror Round, Sports Shoot.

517
00:25:21,937 --> 00:25:23,897
<i>Hello, I'm a freelance makeup artist</i>

518
00:25:23,939 --> 00:25:25,774
<i>of eight years,</i>

519
00:25:25,858 --> 00:25:27,568
Swag Maker.

520
00:25:27,609 --> 00:25:30,529
<i>I chose "Metal Smash" as my theme.</i>

521
00:25:30,612 --> 00:25:33,407
<i>Whenever a player performs a smash,</i>
<i>I see silver</i>

522
00:25:33,449 --> 00:25:34,825
<i>in the player's movement.</i>

523
00:25:34,908 --> 00:25:36,910
<i>I took that as inspiration</i>

524
00:25:36,952 --> 00:25:39,872
<i>and used silver eyeliner to represent it.</i>

525
00:25:40,122 --> 00:25:41,999
<i>When the sunlight burns your skin,</i>

526
00:25:42,082 --> 00:25:43,000
<i>it's called a sunburn.</i>

527
00:25:43,083 --> 00:25:45,419
<i>So, I decided to go with that theme,</i>
<i>keeping the colors very bold.</i>

528
00:25:45,461 --> 00:25:47,671
<i>You can immediately tell</i>
<i>the look is for a sports shoot.</i>

529
00:25:48,047 --> 00:25:50,382
For your reference, these twins are

530
00:25:50,466 --> 00:25:53,135
KIM MIN-JI AND KIM MIN-SEON
real-life badminton players.

531
00:25:53,677 --> 00:25:57,139
Could we see you rally a bit?

532
00:25:57,181 --> 00:25:58,307
- Could we?
- Please?

533
00:26:01,435 --> 00:26:02,811
They're so cool!

534
00:26:03,562 --> 00:26:05,022
That's impressive.

535
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:07,941
I want to see it from a lower angle.

536
00:26:07,983 --> 00:26:10,027
Please reveal the results

00:26:12,946 --> 00:26:14,281
- I'm nervous for them.
- I wonder who will win.

539
00:26:14,490 --> 00:26:15,657
- Who's the winner?
- Who won?

540
00:26:15,741 --> 00:26:16,909
Who?

541
00:26:17,326 --> 00:26:20,829
SWAG MAKER WINS THE SPORTS SHOOT MATCH

542
00:26:20,871 --> 00:26:23,332
<i>The texture of the silver eyeliner</i>

543
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,125
<i>added a dynamic energy to the look</i>
<i>when the model moved,</i>

544
00:26:25,167 --> 00:26:27,086
which made it look very sporty.

545
00:26:27,169 --> 00:26:29,671
I'm over the moon. I'm ecstatic!

546
00:26:30,172 --> 00:26:31,882

<i>　My look is called</i>
<i>"Ballerina Who Loved Rock Chic."</i>

549
00:26:37,387 --> 00:26:39,348
<i>I added a taste of ballet core</i>

550
00:26:39,389 --> 00:26:43,685
<i>and used highlighter</i>
<i>to create this siren makeup look.</i>

551
00:26:44,353 --> 00:26:46,647
<i>The look is called "Rough Beauty."</i>

552
00:26:46,688 --> 00:26:48,524
<i>It's an embodiment of rough</i>

553
00:26:48,565 --> 00:26:49,608
<i>but elegant beauty.</i>

554
00:26:49,858 --> 00:26:53,195

Beauty Heiress wins.

560

00:27:04,581 --> 00:27:06,125
BEAUTY HEIRESS WINS
Congratulations.

562
00:27:06,208 --> 00:27:07,751
When I took a closer look,

563
00:27:07,835 --> 00:27:12,047
I could see the 80s makeup shapes
in the eye makeup.

564
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,384
<i>That demonstrated your smooth execution</i>
<i>of the given keyword.</i>

565
00:27:15,467 --> 00:27:16,718
Will you be returning to Itaewon?

566
00:27:16,760 --> 00:27:17,761
Of course.

567
00:27:17,845 --> 00:27:19,972
I'll return to where I belong.

568
00:27:20,055 --> 00:27:21,181
What was their keyword?

569
00:27:21,390 --> 00:27:23,058
It's '90s Teen.

570
00:27:23,809 --> 00:27:25,394
What's the focus of your makeup today?

571
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:26,311
The look is called

572
00:27:26,395 --> 00:27:27,604
"Fin.K.L Reboot."

573
00:27:27,688 --> 00:27:28,939
"Fin.K.L Reboot"?

574
00:27:30,065 --> 00:27:32,109
<i>I asked Sung Yu-ri for advice</i>

575
00:27:32,192 --> 00:27:33,944
<i>as her makeup artist,</i>

576
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:37,698
<i>and she said she wore</i>
<i>a lot of blue and green in the '90s.</i>

577
00:27:37,739 --> 00:27:40,242
<i>This is my contemporary interpretation</i>

578
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:42,953
<i>of the stars of the '90s, Fin.K.L,</i>
<i>and their looks.</i>

579
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:45,497
I was a teen in the '90s.

580
00:27:45,581 --> 00:27:48,750
There was a very popular comic at the time
called <i>Unplugged Boy.</i>

581
00:27:48,792 --> 00:27:50,878
"I dance hip-hop when I'm sad."

582
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:53,130
The look is called "The '90s Teen Soul."

583
00:27:53,213 --> 00:27:55,090
<i>This is a reflection of my soul then,</i>

584
00:27:55,174 --> 00:27:58,969
<i>and I wanted to showcase those emotions.</i>

These makeup looks feel familiar.

587
00:28:05,309 --> 00:28:08,604
I'm sure you're reminded of someone
when you look at the first model.

588
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,105
- I know!
- Yes!

589
00:28:10,272 --> 00:28:12,316
<i>Always...</i>

590
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:15,611
The first model's look is called
"Fin.K.L Reboot."

591
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,571
It's both trendy and retro

592
00:28:17,613 --> 00:28:21,366
with some elements borrowed from Y2K,
the current trend.

593
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,951
She really reminds me of Fin.K.L!

594
00:28:22,993 --> 00:28:26,622
The second look is called
"The '90s Teen Soul."

595
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:30,459
The artist wanted to express
the confusion of the turn of the century.

OH DOLCE VITA WINS THE '90S TEEN MATCH

600
00:28:47,059 --> 00:28:50,312
<i>She captured the vibe</i>
<i>of the turn of the century.</i>

601
00:28:50,395 --> 00:28:53,148
<i>The way she shaped the model's lips</i>

602
00:28:53,232 --> 00:28:55,651
<i>and worked on the lip texture</i>
<i>to draw more attention to them</i>

603
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:57,611
<i>was very enticing.</i>

604
00:28:57,653 --> 00:29:00,656
My gosh! I knew it.

605
00:29:01,990 --> 00:29:05,202
Next is Futurism.

606
00:29:05,661 --> 00:29:07,829
Futurism isn't a theme
you usually work with, right?

607
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:10,499
Yes, this theme is only ever seen
in music videos, photoshoots,

608
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:11,959
or something conceptual,

609
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:14,920
like a mission of some sort.

610
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,297
- It's a very fun theme to work with.
- Is it?

611
00:29:17,339 --> 00:29:20,968
Models for Futurism, please enter.

612
00:29:25,639 --> 00:29:27,015
<i>Wow, that's amazing.</i>

613
00:29:27,099 --> 00:29:28,058
How did they do that?

614
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:31,186
How did they do this?

615
00:29:31,228 --> 00:29:32,646
What did they use?

616
00:29:33,605 --> 00:29:35,148
<i>It was like a work of art.</i>

617
00:29:35,190 --> 00:29:37,859
I didn't expect them
to have prepared this!

618
00:29:37,901 --> 00:29:39,695
- My goodness!
- What is that?

619
00:29:39,778 --> 00:29:42,030
<i>Building a robot is cheating!</i>

620
00:29:42,114 --> 00:29:44,950
As soon as I saw the look,
I thought, "This artist is crazy."

621
00:29:45,033 --> 00:29:46,368
Just...

622
00:29:47,744 --> 00:29:48,870
DURING THE 1-ON-1 ROUND MATCHING

623
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:51,957
I'll choose Futurism.

624
00:29:52,040 --> 00:29:54,459
There's no way I can go against her.

625
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:56,461
How can anyone go against her?

626
00:29:56,545 --> 00:30:00,173
Please step forward
if you want to go against Never Dead Queen

627
00:30:00,215 --> 00:30:03,260
for the Futurism match.

628
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:05,637
Anyone?

629
00:30:05,721 --> 00:30:08,557
Everyone is looking away.

630
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,933
Are you scared?

631
00:30:10,892 --> 00:30:12,102
I'm terrified.

632
00:30:12,185 --> 00:30:14,896
If I go against her,
I'll have to pack up and leave.

633
00:30:16,898 --> 00:30:19,735
<i>Special effects makeup</i>
<i>is on another level.</i>

634
00:30:19,776 --> 00:30:22,654
I don't know what she's planning on doing.

635
00:30:22,738 --> 00:30:26,074
Never Dead Queen did not find a match.

636
00:30:26,116 --> 00:30:29,369
Please wait while we find artists
for the other keywords first.

637
00:30:31,246 --> 00:30:32,539
<i>I also didn't want to go against her.</i>

638
00:30:33,498 --> 00:30:37,461
<i>I thought too much</i>
<i>and stayed there for too long.</i>

639
00:30:38,712 --> 00:30:41,256
PURE WITCH
CHIEF DIRECTOR OF "SOONSOO"

640
00:30:41,340 --> 00:30:43,759
Pure Witch,
as you're the last one remaining,

641
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:46,345
you will automatically
be assigned to Futurism.

642
00:30:46,428 --> 00:30:49,931
You will go against Never Dead Queen.

643
00:30:50,015 --> 00:30:51,683
I didn't want to go against you.

644
00:30:53,602 --> 00:30:55,937
I'm very curious about this match.

645
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:57,314
- Futurism?
- Yes.

646
00:30:58,106 --> 00:31:00,650
FUTURISM TWIN MODELS: MICHI AND TOSHI
The models look perfect for the theme.

647
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,364
She's been the makeup artist
for Lee Jung-hyun for 20 years.

648
00:31:05,447 --> 00:31:06,865
Yes, I heard someone mention that.

649
00:31:06,948 --> 00:31:09,493
From her "Bakkwo" days until now.

650
00:31:09,576 --> 00:31:11,953
That tells us everything we need to know.

651
00:31:12,454 --> 00:31:13,789
It's a Y2K look.

652
00:31:14,915 --> 00:31:17,209
<i>I've been Lee Jung-hyun's makeup artist</i>
<i>for a long time.</i>

653
00:31:17,292 --> 00:31:20,670
I've tweaked her makeup for "Bakkwo"

654
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:24,383
to create a re-imagined look of Futurism

655
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:25,967
<i>with a retro twist.</i>

656
00:31:26,009 --> 00:31:28,303
<i>I planned only to use makeup products</i>

657
00:31:28,387 --> 00:31:30,806
<i>to achieve that look.</i>

658
00:31:34,976 --> 00:31:36,520
She's sketching something.

659
00:31:37,646 --> 00:31:39,523
- Are they butterfly wings on both sides?
- Yes.

660
00:31:39,606 --> 00:31:41,316
It'll be all about symmetry.

661
00:31:41,358 --> 00:31:43,527
Oh, my! That's so pretty.

662
00:31:44,653 --> 00:31:47,322
<i>In my mind,</i>

663
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:50,659
<i>Futurism is about our butterfly flaps</i>
<i>bringing huge changes in the future.</i>

664
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:53,495
<i>I wanted to portray that hopeful aspect.</i>

665
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:55,247
So, I prepared a futuristic look

666
00:31:55,330 --> 00:31:58,291
<i>of the butterfly effect.</i>

667
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:01,795
<i>As I wanted a butterfly on his face,</i>

668
00:32:01,837 --> 00:32:04,714
<i>I started from his eyes and drew</i>
<i>the butterfly with eyeliner</i>

669
00:32:05,006 --> 00:32:07,426
<i>and added many layers of colors.</i>

670
00:32:08,093 --> 00:32:11,638
<i>I added each layer, one at a time,</i>

671
00:32:11,680 --> 00:32:14,558
<i>to make the colors more vibrant.</i>

672
00:32:14,891 --> 00:32:17,394
You know the patterns
on a butterfly's wings?

673
00:32:17,477 --> 00:32:20,439
<i>I added those details like haze.</i>

674
00:32:20,522 --> 00:32:23,066
<i>Those details were my finishing touches.</i>

675
00:32:25,277 --> 00:32:27,070
How did you sketch all of that?

676
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:28,613
I thought you used a stencil for it.

677
00:32:28,697 --> 00:32:31,032
- She only used pencil eyeliners.
- I know! I'm blown away.

678
00:32:31,366 --> 00:32:32,659
How did she only use pencil liners?

679
00:32:32,701 --> 00:32:34,619
She did such a great job
that I'm speechless.

680
00:32:39,624 --> 00:32:43,462
<i>All contestants said one thing</i>
<i>when they saw me today.</i>

681
00:32:44,713 --> 00:32:46,214
Did you bring a pot again?

682
00:32:46,256 --> 00:32:50,552
No, everyone's been asking me that today.

683
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,014
- It's not a pot this time.
- Something else?

684
00:32:54,055 --> 00:32:55,807
<i>I've brought something new.</i>

685
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:01,771
<i>Everyone's expecting me to prepare</i>
<i>a special effects makeup for the theme,</i>

686
00:33:01,855 --> 00:33:05,025
but I don't like being predictable.

687
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,234
I'm cheeky like that.

688
00:33:06,860 --> 00:33:09,905
<i>I wanted to focus more on aesthetics</i>
<i>and not prepare a special effects look.</i>

689
00:33:10,530 --> 00:33:15,368
<i>I prepared an aesthetic</i>
<i>painting technique for today.</i>

690
00:33:16,745 --> 00:33:19,456
My look is called

691
00:33:19,539 --> 00:33:22,626
<i>"Pieces of Humanity and Faded Emotions."</i>

692
00:33:22,709 --> 00:33:24,753
<i>In the future that I imagine,</i>

693
00:33:24,794 --> 00:33:28,465
people's feelings and individuality
have disappeared

694
00:33:28,548 --> 00:33:31,676
<i>from years of being trapped</i>
<i>in the digital world of social media.</i>

695
00:33:31,760 --> 00:33:35,639
<i>I wanted to create a robotic look</i>
<i>in a colorless world.</i>

696
00:33:36,598 --> 00:33:40,060
<i>To achieve a skin tone</i>
<i>without any trace of liveliness,</i>

697
00:33:40,101 --> 00:33:43,104
<i>I used white concealer all over his face.</i>

698
00:33:44,773 --> 00:33:49,277
I thought a lot about the skin texture

699
00:33:49,945 --> 00:33:52,322
<i>and decided to prepare</i>
<i>a collagen wrapping mask.</i>

700
00:33:52,739 --> 00:33:56,618
<i>It's a peel-off facial mask product.</i>

701
00:33:56,701 --> 00:33:58,912
<i>I thought that'd be perfect for the look,</i>

702
00:33:58,954 --> 00:34:02,165
<i>so I applied a layer of that</i>
<i>to create a coated layer.</i>

703
00:34:02,249 --> 00:34:04,584
<i>That could reflect the lights</i>

704
00:34:04,626 --> 00:34:06,211
to make the model look more robot-like.

705
00:34:07,420 --> 00:34:08,922
She's using a collagen facial mask?

706
00:34:09,631 --> 00:34:12,467
<i>I mixed metallic powder in the mask</i>

707
00:34:12,509 --> 00:34:14,803
<i>to create a steel-like texture.</i>

708
00:34:20,475 --> 00:34:22,852
<i>She knows how to be creative</i>
<i>with all sorts of products.</i>

709
00:34:25,105 --> 00:34:27,440
<i>I drew shattered glass pieces</i>

710
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,360
<i>using an aqua palette.</i>

711
00:34:31,820 --> 00:34:33,238
<i>Then, I added contouring</i>

712
00:34:33,321 --> 00:34:35,490
<i>and finer details.</i>

713
00:34:35,824 --> 00:34:38,785
<i>The shattered glass pieces represent</i>

714
00:34:38,827 --> 00:34:42,455
<i>pieces of shattered humanity.</i>

715
00:34:44,291 --> 00:34:47,794
They're broken pieces, right?

716
00:34:47,836 --> 00:34:49,921
- I think so.
- It's like a broken mirror.

717
00:34:50,630 --> 00:34:52,299
What a challenging project.

718
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,013
She got something else out!

719
00:34:58,388 --> 00:34:59,514
She must be making something again.

720
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,683
Will that be the model's skin?

721
00:35:03,310 --> 00:35:04,853
Where will she use that on?

722
00:35:05,270 --> 00:35:06,980
She's measuring it.

723
00:35:07,439 --> 00:35:09,733
Is that going to be a different element?

724
00:35:10,025 --> 00:35:11,151
I can't wait to find out!

725
00:35:11,693 --> 00:35:14,112
<i>I wasn't completely satisfied</i>
<i>with the look.</i>

726
00:35:14,988 --> 00:35:17,574
There weren't any layer differences
or steel pieces.

727
00:35:17,949 --> 00:35:20,035
<i>How could I achieve</i>
<i>that three-dimensional look?</i>

728
00:35:20,076 --> 00:35:22,162
I decided to incorporate
an aesthetic element for it.

729
00:35:22,704 --> 00:35:24,873
<i>I cut a hydrogel facial mask</i>

730
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:26,333
<i>into smaller pieces</i>

731
00:35:26,875 --> 00:35:28,376
<i>to make them look like shattered pieces.</i>

732
00:35:28,460 --> 00:35:29,419
<i>Then, I covered them</i>

733
00:35:29,502 --> 00:35:30,837
SHATTERED PIECES
<i>with metallic powder.</i>

734
00:35:31,338 --> 00:35:34,883
<i>They came out looking</i>
<i>like real steel pieces from a robot.</i>

735
00:35:35,425 --> 00:35:38,428
<i>That was how I achieved</i>
<i>the robotic look and texture.</i>

736
00:35:38,511 --> 00:35:41,431
<i>I decided to add more textures</i>
<i>using facial masks.</i>

737
00:35:41,514 --> 00:35:43,558
<i>That was the key point of my look.</i>

738
00:35:44,934 --> 00:35:46,561
She's gluing something.

739
00:35:46,895 --> 00:35:48,897
She's adding dimensions
using facial masks.

740
00:35:50,523 --> 00:35:51,941
She knows how to use her tools so well.

741
00:35:57,155 --> 00:35:58,782
It hasn't even been an hour, has it?

742
00:35:58,865 --> 00:36:00,867
No, I still have more to do.

743
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,411
How did you get so far
in less than an hour?

744
00:36:04,371 --> 00:36:06,039
His skin looks like it's been wrapped.

745
00:36:06,081 --> 00:36:09,250
Yes, I wanted to add a metallic feel to it

746
00:36:09,334 --> 00:36:11,586
for that Futurism vibe.

747
00:36:11,670 --> 00:36:13,755
So, I used the wrapping facial mask

748
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:17,592
and added pieces of sheet masks
for the more dimensional pieces.

749
00:36:17,634 --> 00:36:19,427
- That was all for texture.
- Did you apply makeup on top of that?

750
00:36:19,511 --> 00:36:20,595
Yes, I did.

751
00:36:21,429 --> 00:36:24,391
I wanted to achieve
a very robot-like look.

752
00:36:24,432 --> 00:36:27,644
- The facial mask looks like his skin.
- Yes.

753
00:36:27,727 --> 00:36:29,354
That's the point.

754
00:36:31,314 --> 00:36:33,775
- Hello, Pure Witch.
- Hello!

755
00:36:33,817 --> 00:36:35,944
- Hello.
- You're the director of SOONSOO, right?

756
00:36:36,027 --> 00:36:37,821
Yes, hello.

757
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,656
I've heard a lot about you.
Wow, it's a butterfly.

758
00:36:40,281 --> 00:36:41,116
Yes.

759
00:36:42,367 --> 00:36:44,619
- That's stunning.
- Thank you.

760
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:46,454
Those colors!

761
00:36:47,372 --> 00:36:49,165
The colors are gorgeous.

762
00:36:49,749 --> 00:36:54,421
This is flower pollen in the air.

763
00:36:54,462 --> 00:36:55,797
It's flying pollen.

764
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:58,383
Yes, I've added the pollen in the air

765
00:36:58,466 --> 00:37:01,594
from the flapping of the butterfly wings.

766
00:37:01,636 --> 00:37:03,179
Did you use powdered eyeshadow

767
00:37:03,263 --> 00:37:05,181
- for the pollen?
- Yes, I used eyeshadows.

768
00:37:05,890 --> 00:37:09,102
I mixed about 20 eyeshadows

769
00:37:09,144 --> 00:37:10,812
in orange, pink, and white.

770
00:37:16,109 --> 00:37:18,820
<i>I put the powder on a sheet of paper</i>
<i>and blew them onto his face.</i>

771
00:37:19,988 --> 00:37:21,614
<i>I wanted the powder to look</i>

772
00:37:21,656 --> 00:37:24,159
<i>like pollen flying</i>
<i>from the butterfly's wings flapping.</i>

773
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:26,494
Amazing details.

774
00:37:30,665 --> 00:37:31,791
This is so interesting.

775
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:35,378
It's an Atlantis Prince.

776
00:37:36,379 --> 00:37:37,464
And the guy from
the Megapass commercial.

777
00:37:38,882 --> 00:37:41,926
If these are their looks
for the second round,

778
00:37:42,010 --> 00:37:45,263
what are they possibly going to do
in the next rounds?

779
00:37:46,514 --> 00:37:47,932
That's beautiful!

780
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:51,186
She did a wonderful job
with the base makeup.

781
00:37:52,187 --> 00:37:54,606
A Futurism look with a drop of beauty.

782
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:55,899
It's aesthetic.

783
00:37:55,982 --> 00:37:57,567
That's going to be a hard call.

784
00:37:58,067 --> 00:37:59,319
<i>They came so prepared.</i>

785
00:37:59,903 --> 00:38:01,863
<i>How did they even prepare these looks?</i>

786
00:38:02,363 --> 00:38:04,073
You'll know when you see it.

787
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:07,952
<i>That I've come with so much determination.</i>

788
00:38:08,536 --> 00:38:11,873
I think I did a better job

789
00:38:11,915 --> 00:38:14,501
<i>at preparing a makeup look</i>
<i>using only makeup products.</i>

790
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:18,880
Models for Futurism, please enter.

791
00:38:22,717 --> 00:38:25,011
I hear something heavy.

792
00:38:32,519 --> 00:38:33,770
That's incredible.

793
00:38:36,397 --> 00:38:38,650
Look at all those items!

794
00:38:47,033 --> 00:38:48,660
Me?

795
00:38:48,952 --> 00:38:50,662
- He shot me!
- Did you get shot?

796
00:38:50,745 --> 00:38:51,955
Yes, I did!

797
00:38:54,916 --> 00:38:57,085
I'll now present the looks.

798
00:38:57,919 --> 00:38:59,337
<i>The first look is called</i>

799
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:02,674
<i>"Pieces of Humanity and Faded Emotions."</i>

800
00:39:02,757 --> 00:39:05,343
The artist used achromatic colors,
including black, white, and silver,

801
00:39:05,426 --> 00:39:07,929
to use the lack of colors
as a mode to deliver the message.

802
00:39:07,971 --> 00:39:10,139
The broken glass pieces on his face

803
00:39:10,223 --> 00:39:13,434
represent the shattered pieces
of emotions and individuality.

804
00:39:16,938 --> 00:39:17,939
<i>The second look is called</i>

805
00:39:17,981 --> 00:39:19,232
<i>"Butterfly Effect."</i>

806
00:39:19,941 --> 00:39:22,694
<i>The look symbolizes</i>
<i>an unpredictable future</i>

807
00:39:22,777 --> 00:39:26,281
that can change
by the flutter of a butterfly's wings.

808
00:39:33,913 --> 00:39:37,208
<i>Judges, please begin your evaluations.</i>

809
00:39:37,584 --> 00:39:40,879
EVALUATING THE FUTURISM LOOKS

810
00:39:41,629 --> 00:39:43,673
They're taking a closer look!

811
00:39:45,133 --> 00:39:46,134
Oh, gosh!

812
00:39:53,349 --> 00:39:55,685
This artist stuck pieces of something
on his face.

813
00:39:55,768 --> 00:39:58,187
Did they make these pieces?

814
00:39:58,271 --> 00:40:00,648
- I think I know who this is.
- Me too.

815
00:40:02,066 --> 00:40:03,610
The details are so intricate.

816
00:40:05,778 --> 00:40:09,198
<i>From the makeup on his face,</i>
<i>to the outfit, the props,</i>

817
00:40:09,657 --> 00:40:12,285
<i>and the tiny details,</i>
<i>like his contact lenses</i>

818
00:40:12,327 --> 00:40:14,996
<i>and speckles of body paint on his body,</i>

819
00:40:15,455 --> 00:40:17,999
<i>this artist brought Futurism to life</i>

820
00:40:18,041 --> 00:40:21,502
in the most perfect way imaginable.

821
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:25,298
<i>I took a sensational technical approach</i>

822
00:40:25,340 --> 00:40:29,177
<i>by using beauty products.</i>

823
00:40:29,218 --> 00:40:32,180
<i>　But they could just think,</i>
<i>"It's another special effects makeup."</i>

824
00:40:32,221 --> 00:40:34,807
<i>That's my concern.</i>

825
00:40:36,184 --> 00:40:38,353
The wings of a butterfly.

826
00:40:39,854 --> 00:40:41,356
They also drew the freckles, right?

827
00:40:41,981 --> 00:40:42,857
It seems like it.

828
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:47,362
- Could you close your eyes?
- It's a butterfly.

829
00:40:47,403 --> 00:40:48,821
Please close your eyes.

830
00:40:49,864 --> 00:40:51,574
Okay, that's good.

831
00:40:54,953 --> 00:40:58,081
<i>The shining speckles seemed like glitter,</i>

832
00:40:58,164 --> 00:41:00,708
<i>but the artist didn't only add glitters</i>
<i>on the butterfly wings.</i>

833
00:41:00,750 --> 00:41:03,211
<i>They also added some</i>
<i>on the forehead and the nose bridge.</i>

834
00:41:03,878 --> 00:41:05,588
<i>I wondered who was behind it</i>
<i>as I examined it.</i>

835
00:41:05,672 --> 00:41:07,048
I was in awe of the details.

836
00:41:08,341 --> 00:41:09,550
Let's go.

837
00:41:09,968 --> 00:41:10,843
This is very hard.

838
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,472
What a difficult call.
They're so different.

839
00:41:14,555 --> 00:41:16,557
I know. They're so different.

840
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:24,732
Please vote for the look

841
00:41:25,191 --> 00:41:27,151
that reflects Futurism better.

842
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:31,197
Press 1 for the model on the left,
and press 2 for the one on the right.

843
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:46,629
The judges have finished voting.

844
00:41:46,713 --> 00:41:50,550
The two artists for Futurism,
please enter.

845
00:41:51,426 --> 00:41:53,553
I want to know who they are
but don't at the same time.

846
00:41:56,889 --> 00:41:59,434
- I knew it!
- Yes.

847
00:42:01,227 --> 00:42:04,022
They were Never Dead Queen and Pure Witch.

848
00:42:05,565 --> 00:42:06,774
It's Ms. Choi!

849
00:42:08,109 --> 00:42:09,444
Is it Ms. Choi?

850
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:13,281
Everyone seems to be in shock
to see Pure Witch.

851
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,742
- You didn't expect her at all, right?
- Not at all.

852
00:42:16,117 --> 00:42:19,078
Never Dead Queen seems to have prepared
a presentation as well.

853
00:42:19,454 --> 00:42:23,166
Yes, they say,
"Know thy enemy and know thy self."

854
00:42:23,249 --> 00:42:25,835
Knowing Saem-mool has been working

855
00:42:25,918 --> 00:42:28,629
on her scrapbooks for a very long time,

856
00:42:28,671 --> 00:42:31,049
I prepared a visual component
to present my look to the judges.

857
00:42:31,132 --> 00:42:32,175
I see.

858
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:37,138
We'll announce the results now.

859
00:42:37,805 --> 00:42:41,350
Please reveal the results

860
00:42:41,976 --> 00:42:43,352
of the Futurism match

861
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,480
of the 1-on-1 Mirror Round.

862
00:42:46,355 --> 00:42:47,315
Please reveal the results.

863
00:42:48,691 --> 00:42:50,443
<i>I put my heart and soul into this.</i>

864
00:42:50,485 --> 00:42:52,487
<i>I was desperate</i>
<i>to have the judges know that.</i>

865
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:55,823
<i>I wasn't affected by the judges.</i>

866
00:42:55,907 --> 00:42:58,409
<i>I was more affected by Never Dead Queen.</i>

867
00:43:00,078 --> 00:43:01,496
Please reveal

868
00:43:02,538 --> 00:43:03,831
- the results.
- Oh, goodness.

869
00:43:05,666 --> 00:43:06,959
Congratulations!

870
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,587
Congratulations!

871
00:43:09,670 --> 00:43:11,172
NEVER DEAD QUEEN WINS

872
00:43:11,255 --> 00:43:13,299
A huge congratulations to you.

873
00:43:14,383 --> 00:43:16,177
Never Dead Queen will advance
to the next round

874
00:43:16,219 --> 00:43:19,180
with votes from all four judges.
Congratulations.

875
00:43:20,181 --> 00:43:24,519
I was astounded when the model entered,

876
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,312
but I was even more astounded
when I took a closer look.

877
00:43:26,646 --> 00:43:30,108
<i>How did you manage to prepare all this</i>

878
00:43:30,191 --> 00:43:31,984
<i>and pull it off in just two hours?</i>

879
00:43:32,276 --> 00:43:35,822
I could really tell
that you were crazy about makeup.

880
00:43:36,197 --> 00:43:38,783
I could really feel your sincerity.

881
00:43:39,408 --> 00:43:42,245
<i>I could also see</i>
<i>that every detail was on point up close.</i>

882
00:43:42,328 --> 00:43:45,581
<i>You captured Futurism perfectly.</i>

883
00:43:45,665 --> 00:43:49,710
I wholeheartedly think you're magnificent.

884
00:43:50,211 --> 00:43:53,089
The model walked in and shot me.

885
00:43:54,590 --> 00:43:57,426
From then on, as soon as I saw him,

886
00:43:57,510 --> 00:43:59,762
I was in awe
of your sick obsession with the details.

887
00:43:59,846 --> 00:44:03,891
You even added shattered pieces
on his hips.

888
00:44:03,933 --> 00:44:05,685
- That was incredible.
- Thank you.

889
00:44:05,726 --> 00:44:07,436
- Thank you.
- Yes.

890
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:10,064
This is the first time
all judges voted for the same person.

891
00:44:11,274 --> 00:44:12,775
How do you feel?

892
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:14,569
I put a lot of thought into it,

893
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:18,447
as one wrong move could make
the look seem very childish.

894
00:44:18,531 --> 00:44:23,035
But as I had prepared
a special effects look in Round One,

895
00:44:23,077 --> 00:44:25,788
I wanted to show something different.

896
00:44:26,080 --> 00:44:30,293
So, I wanted to prove
that I could use beauty products.

897
00:44:30,376 --> 00:44:34,005
I wanted to become a contestant
that would excite you for the next round.

898
00:44:34,088 --> 00:44:35,506
It's all thanks to you. Thank you.

899
00:44:36,299 --> 00:44:37,758
- Great work.
- You did great.

900
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,302
- Never Dead Queen,
- Yes.

901
00:44:39,385 --> 00:44:41,596
you prepared a presentation,
studied the makeup,

902
00:44:41,637 --> 00:44:43,097
and did a deep dive on the judges.

903
00:44:43,598 --> 00:44:45,266
You put in so much effort for today.

904
00:44:45,308 --> 00:44:47,059
- I couldn't sleep.
- I see.

905
00:44:47,101 --> 00:44:48,186
You're the best.

906
00:44:48,269 --> 00:44:49,520
Pure Witch,

907
00:44:49,896 --> 00:44:52,648
- unfortunately, you've been eliminated.
- Yes.

908
00:44:52,732 --> 00:44:55,109
Seo Ok's jaw was on the floor

909
00:44:55,193 --> 00:44:57,612
when she saw your makeup.

910
00:44:57,904 --> 00:44:59,405
- Thank you.
- Seriously.

911
00:44:59,780 --> 00:45:01,699
It was so hard to choose

912
00:45:01,782 --> 00:45:03,492
because Pure Witch's look
was so full of details.

913
00:45:03,576 --> 00:45:07,121
<i>I could tell so much effort had gone</i>

914
00:45:07,205 --> 00:45:09,540
into every sparkle and color blending.

915
00:45:10,625 --> 00:45:12,501
I can now see

916
00:45:12,585 --> 00:45:14,503
why my jaw was on the floor
the whole time.

917
00:45:14,587 --> 00:45:15,421
A master is a master.

918
00:45:15,463 --> 00:45:20,468
Never Dead Queen has an impeccable taste
in special effects makeup

919
00:45:20,509 --> 00:45:24,013
and has put in so much effort
in every little detail.

920
00:45:24,096 --> 00:45:27,558
I was thoroughly impressed
as I watched her.

921
00:45:28,142 --> 00:45:29,810
Pure Witch, you've been eliminated,

922
00:45:29,852 --> 00:45:32,271
- but your work was exquisite.
- Thank you.

923
00:45:32,313 --> 00:45:34,774
- Great work, both of you!
- Good job.

924
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,153
Please shoot me one more time.

925
00:45:43,324 --> 00:45:44,492
That was good acting.

926
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:47,495
Oh, gosh, that's...

927
00:45:47,536 --> 00:45:48,663
- I'm in awe.
- Same.

928
00:45:49,497 --> 00:45:50,998
She's a fighter.

929
00:45:52,124 --> 00:45:54,335
She's such an incredible person.

930
00:45:54,377 --> 00:45:56,379
<i>How much effort is she putting into this?</i>

931
00:45:56,671 --> 00:45:58,965
<i>I bet she hasn't gotten a wink of sleep.</i>

932
00:45:59,006 --> 00:46:01,217
<i>You can see the passion</i>
<i>burning in her eyes.</i>

933
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:02,635
<i>It looked like an artwork.</i>

934
00:46:03,302 --> 00:46:04,428
I told you!

935
00:46:10,685 --> 00:46:12,979
<i>Every day, I tell myself,</i>

936
00:46:13,646 --> 00:46:17,483
"Be as desperate as you were
when you first got into makeup."

937
00:46:18,734 --> 00:46:21,529
<i>I don't know how far I'll make it,</i>

938
00:46:21,612 --> 00:46:23,364
<i>but I want to excel beyond measure</i>

939
00:46:23,698 --> 00:46:26,534
in every single round.

940
00:46:37,211 --> 00:46:39,213
What are you writing?

941
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,464
I'm studying.

942
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,550
- She's so passionate.
- She's the best.

943
00:46:42,633 --> 00:46:43,884
I love makeup with all my heart!

944
00:46:43,926 --> 00:46:46,178
- She's here to win.
- She's something else.

945
00:46:46,387 --> 00:46:47,471
I'm a fan.

946
00:46:48,264 --> 00:46:50,057
- Never Dead Queen!
- I'm done studying.

947
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:51,726
Go get some rest!

948
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:53,394
No, I'm rooting for him!

949
00:46:53,686 --> 00:46:55,146
Are you taking notes? On what?

950
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:57,857
I'm rooting for him as a big fan.

951
00:46:57,898 --> 00:46:59,567
He's so incredible.

952
00:46:59,608 --> 00:47:00,901
First Man?

953
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:05,031
When else would I get to see him work?

954
00:47:05,072 --> 00:47:05,906
FIRST MAN, FREELANCE MAKEUP ARTIST

955
00:47:05,990 --> 00:47:06,991
He's amazing.

956
00:47:07,074 --> 00:47:09,785
<i>He's the pioneer</i>
<i>of freelance makeup artists.</i>

957
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:11,996
<i>I can't believe I'm watching him work.</i>

958
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:16,792
<i>I'm preparing the look</i>
<i>of a supermodel in the 1990s.</i>

959
00:47:16,876 --> 00:47:18,127
<i>- </i>It's a yes from me.
- It's a yes from me.

960
00:47:18,544 --> 00:47:20,338
<i>A legend is indeed a legend.</i>

961
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:23,841
<i>He possesses so many details</i>

962
00:47:23,924 --> 00:47:26,052
in arts and humanities.

963
00:47:26,260 --> 00:47:29,221
It's all inside him in that solid core.

964
00:47:29,263 --> 00:47:31,265
I'll go for Glam Grunge.

965
00:47:31,349 --> 00:47:33,976
Okay, you've chosen Glam Grunge.

966
00:47:34,060 --> 00:47:36,354
First Man and Glam Grunge.

967
00:47:40,024 --> 00:47:41,275
This will be interesting.

968
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,112
- Okay!
- He did a 90-degree bow!

969
00:47:45,196 --> 00:47:48,449
Seongsu-dong Prince has come forward.

970
00:47:51,660 --> 00:47:53,788
<i>Seongsu-dong Prince.</i>

971
00:47:53,829 --> 00:47:56,374
He's confident about his makeup.

972
00:47:56,457 --> 00:47:58,876
I can feel his pride.

973
00:47:58,959 --> 00:48:01,962
<i>He wasn't just bold,</i>
<i>but also very attentive to details.</i>

974
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:03,756
<i>His makeup looked very complete.</i>

975
00:48:03,798 --> 00:48:05,966
I didn't expect much,
but he's very talented.

976
00:48:06,008 --> 00:48:07,635
<i>A talent I didn't know about.</i>

977
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,262
First Man and Seongsu-dong Prince,

978
00:48:10,304 --> 00:48:12,390
you have been matched for Glam Grunge.

979
00:48:12,473 --> 00:48:14,141
What's Glam Grunge?

980
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:15,684
That's hard, right?

981
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,188
Glam Grunge is glamorous but messy.

982
00:48:19,271 --> 00:48:21,816
That's Seongsu-dong Prince's style.

983
00:48:22,483 --> 00:48:24,777
<i>It won't be an easy fight.</i>

984
00:48:25,152 --> 00:48:28,989
<i>Glam Grunge has a rock and roll element,</i>

985
00:48:29,031 --> 00:48:31,075
<i>and smoky makeup is a must.</i>

986
00:48:31,325 --> 00:48:34,620
<i>Seongsu-dong Prince's vibe is</i>

987
00:48:34,662 --> 00:48:37,706
already very close to Glam Grunge.

988
00:48:37,790 --> 00:48:39,542
<i>He looks grungy</i>

989
00:48:39,625 --> 00:48:41,627
<i>but also quite glamorous.</i>

990
00:48:41,669 --> 00:48:45,005
I knew I had a good chance.

991
00:48:45,047 --> 00:48:47,675
As funny as I may sound now,
I'm confident.

992
00:48:47,967 --> 00:48:49,135
I must win.

993
00:48:49,552 --> 00:48:51,178
Don't be intimidated
after you see my work.

994
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:53,973
It's a battle between
an older male makeup artist

995
00:48:54,014 --> 00:48:56,767
- and a young rookie male makeup artist.
- You're right.

996
00:48:57,309 --> 00:49:00,020
<i>The two artists have</i>
<i>such different tastes,</i>

997
00:49:00,104 --> 00:49:02,022
<i>so I look forward to their final looks.</i>

998
00:49:02,273 --> 00:49:05,901
<i>I'm excited to see</i>
<i>an already-famous star makeup artist</i>

999
00:49:05,985 --> 00:49:11,532
<i>against a new, rising makeup artist.</i>

1000
00:49:12,366 --> 00:49:14,034
This is Glam Grunge, right?

1001
00:49:14,118 --> 00:49:15,578
It's begun.

1002
00:49:15,661 --> 00:49:17,580
- Good luck to both of them.
- Good luck!

1003
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:19,790
- We're rooting for you.
- You can do it!

1004
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:22,209
I heard you weren't a professional model.

1005
00:49:22,293 --> 00:49:24,336
I used to be a K-pop idol singer.

1006
00:49:24,378 --> 00:49:26,839
That explains your smooth skin
and handsome face.

1007
00:49:26,881 --> 00:49:27,965
Thank you.

1008
00:49:28,048 --> 00:49:29,884
Was your twin brother also a K-pop idol?

1009
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,218
- Yes.
- I see.

1010
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:33,387
<i>BOYFRIEND is so famous.</i>

1011
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:37,516
The group sang
a lot of lovely-themed songs.

1012
00:49:38,225 --> 00:49:41,520
- Here's the theme of today's look.
- Okay.

1013
00:49:41,562 --> 00:49:43,856
This look won't make any sense

1014
00:49:43,898 --> 00:49:45,691
without the storytelling.

1015
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:48,360
This look is that of a clubber by night

1016
00:49:48,402 --> 00:49:51,238
<i>and a mechanic by day.</i>

1017
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,865
And where is this man?

1018
00:49:52,907 --> 00:49:54,408
At a beach in Miami

1019
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:57,620
<i>or Yangyang, so he needs a tan.</i>

1020
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,372
<i>I used darker base makeup products</i>

1021
00:50:00,414 --> 00:50:03,626
<i>and evenly spread them</i>
<i>to create a baked look.</i>

1022
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:05,753
Have you ever had such dark makeup on?

1023
00:50:05,794 --> 00:50:07,630
No, it's my first time.

1024
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,007
Look up.

1025
00:50:10,758 --> 00:50:12,593
<i>I prepared smoky eyes,</i>

1026
00:50:12,885 --> 00:50:15,471
<i>but the key point of this look was</i>

1027
00:50:15,554 --> 00:50:19,308
<i>to have the eye makeup</i>
<i>naturally melt over time.</i>

1028
00:50:19,725 --> 00:50:23,604
<i>So, I purposely prepared the smoky eyes</i>
<i>using easily blendable pencil eyeliner.</i>

1029
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:27,441
<i>I added depth to the eyes</i>
<i>by blending the liners.</i>

1030
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:29,902
He looks like a dirty man.

1031
00:50:29,944 --> 00:50:32,571
Dirty, but in a good way.

1032
00:50:33,072 --> 00:50:34,198
You look great!

1033
00:50:39,286 --> 00:50:40,871
Let's go!

1034
00:50:41,288 --> 00:50:44,124
<i>To be honest,</i>
<i>when I saw First Man's makeup,</i>

1035
00:50:44,625 --> 00:50:46,293
I thought it was missing glam.

1036
00:50:46,794 --> 00:50:51,048
<i>I didn't expect him to focus so much</i>
<i>on the grunge part.</i>

1037
00:50:51,257 --> 00:50:54,176
<i>When I imagined Glam Grunge,</i>

1038
00:50:54,260 --> 00:50:56,720
I thought "glam" was closer
to a party life,

1039
00:50:56,804 --> 00:50:59,682
while "grunge" was
more like a corrupt soul.

1040
00:50:59,765 --> 00:51:01,809
<i>So, I wanted to create a look of someone</i>

1041
00:51:01,850 --> 00:51:05,479
<i>in a mess, going home after a party.</i>

1042
00:51:05,521 --> 00:51:09,483
With that in mind,
my inspiration was "5 a.m."

1043
00:51:10,651 --> 00:51:15,072
<i>His brows really got in my way</i>
<i>of contouring his face.</i>

1044
00:51:15,573 --> 00:51:16,865
Have you ever glued your brows?

1045
00:51:16,949 --> 00:51:18,200
No, never.

1046
00:51:18,826 --> 00:51:20,953
I'm great at making brows disappear.

1047
00:51:21,245 --> 00:51:24,665
<i>I glued his brows using the glue</i>
<i>used by drag queens abroad</i>

1048
00:51:24,707 --> 00:51:26,375
<i>and completely covered his brows.</i>

1049
00:51:26,667 --> 00:51:29,628
<i>After making the hairs invisible,</i>
<i>I contoured his eyes.</i>

1050
00:51:29,670 --> 00:51:32,172
<i>I wanted to create a look of a gaunt man.</i>

1051
00:51:32,256 --> 00:51:34,341
- Isn't his Glam Grunge makeup so good?
- Who?

1052
00:51:34,383 --> 00:51:36,385
- This guy.
- Yes, I saw it too.

1053
00:51:36,468 --> 00:51:39,471
The way he contoured the eyes...

1054
00:51:39,513 --> 00:51:41,140
- He erased his brows too.
- Yes, the brows.

1055
00:51:41,181 --> 00:51:42,975
- Erasing the brows was a nice touch.
- Right.

1056
00:51:43,392 --> 00:51:46,020
<i>I set bronze as my main color</i>

1057
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:48,856
<i>and added depth to his eyes</i>
<i>using contouring.</i>

1058
00:51:50,107 --> 00:51:51,817
<i>Then, to give an overall shine,</i>

1059
00:51:51,859 --> 00:51:54,320
<i>I dabbed bits of glitter eyeshadow</i>
<i>as the highlight of the look.</i>

1060
00:51:55,195 --> 00:51:57,656
He looks amazing!

1061
00:51:57,698 --> 00:51:58,532
Doesn't he look so sexy?

1062
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:04,038
Maybe it's from his days
as a content creator, but he's artistic.

1063
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,290
<i>I even added a storyline.</i>

1064
00:52:06,373 --> 00:52:09,460
<i>I made the look more grungy</i>

1065
00:52:09,543 --> 00:52:11,545
<i>by drawing traces of tears</i>

1066
00:52:11,629 --> 00:52:15,090
<i>that could've been out of joy or sadness</i>
<i>at the party.</i>

1067
00:52:15,424 --> 00:52:18,302
Seongsu-dong Prince is a surprise.

1068
00:52:18,385 --> 00:52:19,386
- He's so good.
- He's so talented!

1069
00:52:19,470 --> 00:52:21,347
- It looks incredible.
- Yes, it looks amazing.

1070
00:52:21,388 --> 00:52:24,558
I was worried to see him go
against First Man,

1071
00:52:24,642 --> 00:52:26,894
but his makeup looks stunning!

1072
00:52:27,269 --> 00:52:28,854
Is it going well?

1073
00:52:28,896 --> 00:52:30,731
- Yes.
- It looks great.

1074
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:32,191
Thank you.

1075
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:36,236
<i>Seongsu-dong Prince is much less</i>
<i>experienced than I am,</i>

1076
00:52:36,320 --> 00:52:37,613
<i>so I didn't expect him to be so good.</i>

1077
00:52:37,696 --> 00:52:39,198
<i>But I looked at his work,</i>

1078
00:52:39,657 --> 00:52:40,949
and it looked so beautiful.

1079
00:52:41,033 --> 00:52:42,242
From then on, I just...

1080
00:52:42,284 --> 00:52:43,619
All I could do was sigh.

1081
00:52:45,746 --> 00:52:47,122
<i>I had to pull myself together.</i>

1082
00:52:47,206 --> 00:52:49,249
<i>I had to do everything I intended</i>

1083
00:52:49,333 --> 00:52:52,294
to not leave any regrets.

1084
00:52:52,711 --> 00:52:54,088
Could you get changed

1085
00:52:54,129 --> 00:52:56,090
- before I start the body makeup?
- Yes.

1086
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:58,842
All right.

1087
00:52:59,927 --> 00:53:01,679
He's even putting makeup on his body.

1088
00:53:02,596 --> 00:53:05,557
His arm skin tone looks really good,
doesn't it?

1089
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:09,144
Yes, you can tell
First Man isn't just dabbing away.

1090
00:53:09,228 --> 00:53:10,354
He's making sure every muscle stands out.

1091
00:53:10,562 --> 00:53:12,231
That's impressive.

1092
00:53:12,272 --> 00:53:14,149
Every stroke is intentional.

1093
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:17,986
He's working
with the model's muscles and skeleton.

1094
00:53:18,070 --> 00:53:21,782
I can tell that he's contouring the body
in the most beautiful way possible.

1095
00:53:23,659 --> 00:53:25,994
- You guys are giving me energy.
- You can do it!

1096
00:53:26,495 --> 00:53:27,955
Glam Grunge.

1097
00:53:28,747 --> 00:53:30,249
First Man, are you going

1098
00:53:30,791 --> 00:53:32,626
- for a tanned look?
- That's right.

1099
00:53:32,793 --> 00:53:34,962
Is he a mechanic?

1100
00:53:35,295 --> 00:53:36,964
- A sexy mechanic?
- That's exactly it.

1101
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:40,008
The repair shop with this mechanic

1102
00:53:40,092 --> 00:53:41,552
would get so popular.

1103
00:53:41,635 --> 00:53:43,470
- He looks so sexy now.
- Yes.

1104
00:53:43,512 --> 00:53:45,514
He's a totally different person
from before.

1105
00:53:45,973 --> 00:53:48,350
You've interpreted Glam Grunge
in a different way.

1106
00:53:48,851 --> 00:53:50,269
I like how different it is.

1107
00:53:50,644 --> 00:53:52,312
- Do you like it?
- I love it.

1108
00:53:52,813 --> 00:53:54,189
- Thank you.
- I've always wanted to try this look.

1109
00:53:54,273 --> 00:53:56,525
- This would look good on stage, right?
- Yes.

1110
00:53:56,608 --> 00:53:58,402
Please make me look dirtier.

1111
00:53:58,485 --> 00:53:59,319
More bold!

1112
00:54:00,446 --> 00:54:02,823
You're twins, yet you look so different.

1113
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,742
- Because of the makeup.
- I know.

1114
00:54:05,451 --> 00:54:08,078
The two artists have
such different styles.

1115
00:54:08,829 --> 00:54:10,122
One is so pale,

1116
00:54:10,164 --> 00:54:12,124
and the other is totally tanned.

1117
00:54:12,166 --> 00:54:14,042
This look is glam-focused,

1118
00:54:14,126 --> 00:54:15,669
- and that's more grunge-focused.
- Yes.

1119
00:54:16,503 --> 00:54:21,008
<i>I got a very old-fashioned glitter spray</i>

1120
00:54:21,091 --> 00:54:23,302
<i>to spray glitter all over him.</i>

1121
00:54:23,343 --> 00:54:25,345
He's a prince.

1122
00:54:25,637 --> 00:54:27,890
- He's a great makeup artist, right?
- For sure.

1123
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,017
Everything is so clean. Nothing is messy.

1124
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:35,898
<i>There's a color cream I often use</i>
<i>for photoshoots.</i>

1125
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,316
<i>I added some oil to it.</i>

1126
00:54:37,357 --> 00:54:38,901
Just pour it. That's perfect.

1127
00:54:38,984 --> 00:54:40,027
All right. Thank you.

1128
00:54:42,529 --> 00:54:44,323
- Here it comes!
- The grease marks!

1129
00:54:44,364 --> 00:54:45,949
- Here it is.
- The grease marks!

1130
00:54:46,700 --> 00:54:49,328
He put so much thought into every detail.

1131
00:54:49,369 --> 00:54:51,622
- He's creating dirty nails.
- That looks incredible.

1132
00:54:51,705 --> 00:54:53,457
I have so much respect for him.

1133
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:55,667
I didn't expect him
to put it on his nails!

1134
00:54:55,709 --> 00:54:57,169
The details are unbelievable.

1135
00:54:57,211 --> 00:54:59,713
He did a spot-on job
with the shoulder makeup.

1136
00:55:00,088 --> 00:55:02,883
I love the grease smear beside his lips.

1137
00:55:03,675 --> 00:55:06,386
It looks like you just scratched your face
while working.

1138
00:55:07,054 --> 00:55:09,681
I feel like the judges will like him more.

1139
00:55:10,974 --> 00:55:13,143
Is he doing the model's hair himself?

1140
00:55:13,227 --> 00:55:14,061
I guess so!

1141
00:55:19,483 --> 00:55:22,569
<i>My specialty would be</i>

1142
00:55:22,611 --> 00:55:24,279
my young taste.

1143
00:55:24,363 --> 00:55:25,697
<i>I'm good with overall balance.</i>

1144
00:55:25,739 --> 00:55:28,784
I know I just need to do as well as usual.

1145
00:55:33,664 --> 00:55:37,251
- So handsome!
- So handsome!

1146
00:55:37,292 --> 00:55:38,585
- So cool!
- They're K-pop idols.

1147
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:41,171
- K-pop idols are different!
- It's grungy.

1148
00:55:41,255 --> 00:55:43,757
Those must be grease marks.

1149
00:55:43,841 --> 00:55:46,093
That's incredible.

1150
00:55:48,011 --> 00:55:49,596
- My gosh.
- I can hear everyone gasping in awe.

1151
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:50,931
I heard someone say, "That's incredible."

1152
00:55:52,057 --> 00:55:53,934
- They must look so good.
- I'm so intrigued.

1153
00:55:53,976 --> 00:55:56,270
Please bring them in already.

1154
00:55:56,311 --> 00:55:59,231
Glam Grunge models, please enter.

1155
00:56:02,943 --> 00:56:04,444
- What?
- Gosh.

1156
00:56:07,948 --> 00:56:09,241
They're matching!

1157
00:56:09,283 --> 00:56:10,784
You're right! How did that happen?

1158
00:56:10,868 --> 00:56:14,705
The models are
the twin members of BOYFRIEND.

1159
00:56:14,788 --> 00:56:17,916
They're from BOYFRIEND?

1160
00:56:21,628 --> 00:56:24,172
Oh, my. This is our view?

1161
00:56:24,256 --> 00:56:25,465
It's like an interrogation room.

1162
00:56:27,301 --> 00:56:29,469
I'll now present the looks.

1163
00:56:30,387 --> 00:56:32,306
They look very different
from how they normally look.

1164
00:56:35,475 --> 00:56:38,562
FIRST MAN'S LOOK
The first look is called "Dirty Sexy."

1165
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:42,816
He's a clubber by night
and a mechanic by day.

1166
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:46,778
The look reflects
a grungy, laid-back man's life.

1167
00:56:49,740 --> 00:56:52,159
The second look is called "5 a.m."

1168
00:56:52,451 --> 00:56:55,662
The look is that of a man at 5 a.m.

1169
00:56:55,704 --> 00:56:58,206
after a glamorous party filled with tears

1170
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,833
of either joy or sadness,

1171
00:56:59,875 --> 00:57:03,420
<i>completely messy and grungy.</i>

1172
00:57:05,339 --> 00:57:07,925
<i>- Their outfit colors are so similar.</i>
<i>- I know! They look</i>

1173
00:57:08,008 --> 00:57:09,843
<i>- like they've coordinated the outfits.</i>
<i>- Right?</i>

1174
00:57:09,885 --> 00:57:11,887
The way these looks
have stories behind them

1175
00:57:11,970 --> 00:57:13,764
tells me the artists are content creators.

1176
00:57:13,847 --> 00:57:15,349
- Aren't these stories so good?
- Yes!

1177
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:16,600
- A mechanic by day
- You can imagine it!

1178
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:17,851
- and a clubber by night!
- Yes.

1179
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,227
A mechanic!

1180
00:57:19,686 --> 00:57:21,855
They're really in character.

1181
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:26,318
He even has a mechanic's nails!

1182
00:57:26,360 --> 00:57:27,903
- Did you see the smear from his hand?
- Yes!

1183
00:57:27,986 --> 00:57:30,697
- He even prepared a performance for us.
- Yes.

1184
00:57:31,031 --> 00:57:32,866
<i>It felt like the artist had let it go.</i>

1185
00:57:32,908 --> 00:57:34,910
<i>To create the Glam Grunge look,</i>

1186
00:57:34,993 --> 00:57:37,996
the artist thought
of this dirty sexy theme

1187
00:57:38,038 --> 00:57:41,375
<i>and let go of their techniques</i>
<i>in a very clever way.</i>

1188
00:57:41,792 --> 00:57:43,752
<i>The messy hair,</i>

1189
00:57:43,835 --> 00:57:45,963
<i>eye makeup, freckles,</i>

1190
00:57:46,046 --> 00:57:48,548
<i>and all the grease smears made him look</i>

1191
00:57:48,632 --> 00:57:51,593
<i>like he was really working.</i>

1192
00:57:51,677 --> 00:57:56,431
<i>I also thought it was sick</i>
<i>for the artist to be so detailed</i>

1193
00:57:56,515 --> 00:57:58,850
to outline the model's nails with grease.

1194
00:57:58,892 --> 00:58:01,395
<i>I knew this artist was a master.</i>

1195
00:58:03,605 --> 00:58:07,401
The freckles also look so natural.

1196
00:58:08,068 --> 00:58:10,904
<i>When I examined the makeup in detail,</i>

1197
00:58:10,988 --> 00:58:13,824
<i>I was very impressed</i>

1198
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:18,370
by the artist's way of creating oily skin.

1199
00:58:19,121 --> 00:58:22,666
I think this artist has
a really great sense for makeup.

1200
00:58:23,458 --> 00:58:24,418
I think it might be First Man.

1201
00:58:24,876 --> 00:58:26,169
No?

1202
00:58:26,712 --> 00:58:27,838
Guess!

1203
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:29,715
- It's fun to listen to you.
- Hear me out.

1204
00:58:29,756 --> 00:58:33,885
The texture of the model's skin
is different

1205
00:58:34,094 --> 00:58:35,721
from what most can do.

1206
00:58:35,762 --> 00:58:39,307
I feel like only Calary Girl would think

1207
00:58:39,391 --> 00:58:41,184
- of such a detailed storyline.
- Calary Girl!

1208
00:58:42,269 --> 00:58:44,021
You're wrong, miss.

1209
00:58:46,440 --> 00:58:47,941
I can tell who did this makeup.

1210
00:58:48,650 --> 00:58:49,901
Isn't it Seongsu-dong Prince?

1211
00:58:50,902 --> 00:58:51,945
I think so too!

1212
00:58:51,987 --> 00:58:53,447
- Right? It's...
- Yes.

1213
00:58:53,613 --> 00:58:57,159
- It's Seongsu-dong Prince's style.
- I think it's Seongsu-dong Prince.

1214
00:58:57,451 --> 00:58:59,119
- Oh, my!
- I agree!

1215
00:58:59,202 --> 00:59:00,495
He sees through everything!

1216
00:59:01,788 --> 00:59:03,623
The look was flawless.

1217
00:59:03,957 --> 00:59:07,627
<i>The deep and glamorous eyes.</i>

1218
00:59:07,669 --> 00:59:10,797
<i>The perfect amount of glitter used</i>
<i>to complement the eyes.</i>

1219
00:59:10,881 --> 00:59:14,968
<i>The lip makeup was</i>
<i>also delicate and perfect.</i>

1220
00:59:15,052 --> 00:59:16,762
<i>The details were pristine.</i>

1221
00:59:17,012 --> 00:59:19,890
<i>He looked like a graphic image.</i>

1222
00:59:19,973 --> 00:59:22,225
<i>The artist clearly has</i>
<i>extraordinary techniques.</i>

1223
00:59:22,309 --> 00:59:24,352
Did he cry or laugh?

1224
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,817
<i>The judges only looked at my model briefly</i>

1225
00:59:30,901 --> 00:59:33,153
<i>before crowding around the other model.</i>

1226
00:59:33,195 --> 00:59:37,949
Did I get too invested
in the storytelling?

1227
00:59:38,450 --> 00:59:39,659
<i>I was relieved.</i>

1228
00:59:39,743 --> 00:59:41,745
<i>It means my style is unique.</i>

1229
00:59:41,995 --> 00:59:44,623
I think I can be a bit hopeful.

1230
00:59:45,540 --> 00:59:48,668
<i>I noticed every move of the judges,</i>

1231
00:59:48,710 --> 00:59:50,003
<i>where they looked,</i>

1232
00:59:50,087 --> 00:59:52,839
<i>the smallest moving of their lips,</i>

1233
00:59:52,923 --> 00:59:54,091
<i>and everything else.</i>

1234
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:01,306
This is also a really hard call.

1235
01:00:01,348 --> 01:00:02,182
It's really hard.

1236
01:00:03,975 --> 01:00:05,477
The "5 a.m." look...

1237
01:00:06,311 --> 01:00:07,354
"Dirty Sexy."

1238
01:00:09,231 --> 01:00:11,233
- The grease is the glam for him,
- But...

1239
01:00:11,316 --> 01:00:13,110
and the glitters are the glam for him.

1240
01:00:14,402 --> 01:00:15,403
But...

1241
01:00:17,531 --> 01:00:19,324
- Isn't it hard?
- Yes, it is.

1242
01:00:20,117 --> 01:00:21,618
I'm in a pickle.

1243
01:00:22,369 --> 01:00:24,037
I don't know what to do!

1244
01:00:32,379 --> 01:00:34,548
Judges, have you cast your votes?

1245
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:38,677
Artists behind the Glam Grunge looks,

1246
01:00:38,718 --> 01:00:39,594
please enter.

1247
01:00:42,264 --> 01:00:45,350
They were First Man
and Seongsu-dong Prince.

1248
01:00:46,393 --> 01:00:47,227
Hello.

1249
01:00:47,310 --> 01:00:49,354
These two men prepared

1250
01:00:49,396 --> 01:00:52,399
the fabulous Glam Grunge looks.

1251
01:00:52,440 --> 01:00:54,234
Let's check the results

1252
01:00:54,734 --> 01:00:57,237
for this 1-on-1 Mirror Round...

1253
01:00:57,571 --> 01:00:59,531
- Oh, no.
- ...now.

1254
01:01:00,365 --> 01:01:04,703
Of course, I thought
both participants should pass!

1255
01:01:04,744 --> 01:01:09,249
<i>Seongsu-dong Prince is a huge rising star,</i>

1256
01:01:09,291 --> 01:01:12,419
<i>and First Man is an incredible artist</i>

1257
01:01:12,460 --> 01:01:15,213
<i>who nobody would dare to doubt.</i>

1258
01:01:15,255 --> 01:01:17,757
<i>I was so sad to let one go.</i>

1259
01:01:17,841 --> 01:01:19,551
Why did they have to go
against each other?

1260
01:01:19,593 --> 01:01:21,720
Both of them had stolen my heart.

1261
01:01:21,761 --> 01:01:23,930
<i>I was so excited about these two.</i>

1262
01:01:27,767 --> 01:01:29,102
<i>I was so nervous.</i>

1263
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:32,397
<i>I even wondered if I did a good job.</i>

1264
01:01:35,025 --> 01:01:36,151
<i>I'm confident.</i>

1265
01:01:36,943 --> 01:01:40,113
<i>I'll be the first man to beat First Man.</i>

1266
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:43,658
Please reveal the results
for the Glam Grunge match.

1267
01:01:45,327 --> 01:01:46,536
Who do you think won?

1268
01:01:46,870 --> 01:01:48,288
I can't wait to find out!

1269
01:01:48,872 --> 01:01:50,207
I'm so curious!

1270
01:01:50,916 --> 01:01:53,293
First Man's "Dirty Sexy."

1271
01:01:53,793 --> 01:01:56,713
Seongsu-dong Prince's "5 a.m."

1272
01:01:59,966 --> 01:02:01,551
I wonder who won.

1273
01:02:01,635 --> 01:02:03,303
SEONGSU-DONG PRINCE, FIRST MAN

1274
01:02:03,345 --> 01:02:04,804
Congratulations!

1275
01:02:05,847 --> 01:02:06,890
<i>Any last words?</i>
